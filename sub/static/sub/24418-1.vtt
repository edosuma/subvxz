(upbeat music)

00:11.347 --> 00:14.766
(slow suspenseful music)

01:09.035 --> 01:09.826
- Hi.

01:15.708 --> 01:16.499
Okay.

01:17.836 --> 01:18.626
Oh.

01:20.923 --> 01:22.589
You ready to go home?

01:24.927 --> 01:26.886
♪ Hush little baby ♪

01:26.930 --> 01:29.847
♪ Don't say a word ♪

01:30.850 --> 01:31.849
It's okay.

01:39.192 --> 01:42.986

02:28.120 --> 02:29.870
You're finally a daddy, babe.

02:29.914 --> 02:31.122
- She's beautiful.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.416
- I told you all
it took was faith.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.251
- You ready?

02:35.295 --> 02:38.004
- She's meant to be ours.

02:38.048 --> 02:41.382
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, let's go.

02:45.973 --> 02:47.556
Oh, I love you baby.

02:49.561 --> 02:52.728
We're gonna take such
good care of you.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.043
- You know what,
I never would have

03:14.087 --> 03:15.295
been able to buy this
house if it wasn't for you.

03:15.339 --> 03:17.130
- You're the one that
brought me the script.

03:17.174 --> 03:18.548
The studio's really
happy with your work.

03:18.592 --> 03:20.299
Now Matt's show is not being
received well by everyone

03:20.343 --> 03:21.343
and you know

03:22.346 --> 03:23.971
I've had to fight for it

03:24.014 --> 03:25.013
and you know how I hate
to go out on the limb

03:25.057 --> 03:26.556
for him.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.725
- Yeah, I know, but I
have faith in my husband.

03:27.769 --> 03:28.351
I think the show's
gonna do really well.

03:28.395 --> 03:29.852
- Well I hope so.

03:29.896 --> 03:30.812
- Hey listen,

03:30.855 --> 03:31.604
I want to show you something.

03:31.648 --> 03:33.146
- Okay.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.816
- I mean I'm not supposed
to tell anyone yet but,

03:34.859 --> 03:36.192
- No.

03:36.236 --> 03:37.902
- Yes.

03:37.946 --> 03:39.946
- Our Aubrey is preggers.

03:40.908 --> 03:44.743
(cheers and applause)

03:44.787 --> 03:45.911
- Right as you're about to go
into the six month production,

03:45.955 --> 03:47.162
why didn't you tell me?

03:47.206 --> 03:48.998
- Well, we weren't
supposed to tell anyone

03:49.041 --> 03:50.374
until after we saw the doctor.

03:50.418 --> 03:51.125
- Okay, I need details.

03:51.168 --> 03:51.959
How far along?

03:52.003 --> 03:53.378
Obstetrician.

03:53.422 --> 03:55.005
- Well, I'm 10 weeks,

03:55.048 --> 03:56.548
and Dr. Flickman in Burbank.

03:56.591 --> 03:59.009
- Did you even try
to call my OBGYN?

03:59.052 --> 04:01.428
- Of course, but she's not
taking any new patients.

04:01.596 --> 04:04.097
- Dr. Barnson is the best.

04:04.141 --> 04:05.640
I'm gonna have to get you in

04:05.684 --> 04:06.684
because no friend of mine

04:06.728 --> 04:08.686
is going to see some Dr.

04:08.730 --> 04:09.478
Frickman in Burbank.

04:09.522 --> 04:11.439
I'm be right back.

04:11.482 --> 04:13.150
I want to hear all the details.

04:13.193 --> 04:14.234
- I thought you
didn't want kids.

04:14.278 --> 04:14.984
- Well,

04:15.028 --> 04:16.235
Aubrey did.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.862
- No one's gonna cut any slack.

04:17.905 --> 04:19.531
If our show doesn't rate,

04:19.575 --> 04:20.907
we're all out on the street.

04:20.951 --> 04:24.161
- Then I guess it's
back to rent control.

04:38.387 --> 04:39.178
Hi.

04:40.890 --> 04:43.765
(dramatic music)

04:48.647 --> 04:50.774
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

04:53.570 --> 04:54.652
- I think if we had met,

04:54.696 --> 04:56.695
I would definitely remember.

04:59.618 --> 05:01.034
- You just remind me of someone.

05:01.078 --> 05:02.494
I can't place it.

05:05.792 --> 05:06.540
Sorry.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.002
- Have a nice day.

05:10.046 --> 05:11.545
- [Woman] You too.

05:19.098 --> 05:20.722
- Hi, I am looking for my wife.

05:20.766 --> 05:20.931
She's--

05:22.226 --> 05:24.226
Oh, she's right over there.

05:31.611 --> 05:33.194
- You're late.

05:33.238 --> 05:35.823
- Oh my god, traffic
was a nightmare.

05:36.992 --> 05:38.699
You sure you don't want
to stick with Flickman?

05:38.743 --> 05:40.159
It's like five minutes
down the street

05:40.203 --> 05:41.662
from our house.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.122
- Babe.

05:43.165 --> 05:44.665
- The doctor will be with
you in just a moment.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.583
- [Aubrey] Thank you.

05:46.627 --> 05:47.042
- Hey babe,

05:48.463 --> 05:50.130
you want to do it before
the doctor gets in?

05:50.173 --> 05:52.131
(laughter)

05:52.174 --> 05:53.340
- Matt, come on the
baby might hear you.

05:53.384 --> 05:53.966
- Come on.

05:55.178 --> 05:56.886
How about a little pre-check?

05:56.930 --> 05:57.679
Oh dammit.

05:59.224 --> 05:59.806
- Do you have to be on
your phone right now?

05:59.850 --> 06:01.058
- It's just Vicky.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.103
- Yeah.

06:04.147 --> 06:05.187
Could you just be a little
more present for this.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.813
You know it's a big moment.

06:06.857 --> 06:07.690
- I'm right here.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.692
I couldn't be more present.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.568
- Uh, not really.

06:10.611 --> 06:12.695
You could put your phone away.

06:12.738 --> 06:13.947
- I have enough pressures
without more problems Aubrey.

06:13.991 --> 06:17.117
- My pregnancy is
not a problem Matt.

06:17.161 --> 06:18.785
- That is not--

06:18.829 --> 06:20.954
(knock on the door)

06:20.998 --> 06:23.874
(dramatic music)

06:28.673 --> 06:29.463
- Well hello again.

06:29.507 --> 06:30.423
- [Matt] Hello again.

06:30.466 --> 06:31.340
- What, you two know each other?

06:31.384 --> 06:33.426
- Just downstairs in the lobby.

06:33.469 --> 06:34.635
- She thought I
was someone else.

06:34.679 --> 06:36.262
- Actually, I said
that you look familiar.

06:36.306 --> 06:37.805
It'll come to me.

06:39.310 --> 06:40.184
I'm Dr. Barnson.

06:40.227 --> 06:40.893
- Aubrey Lewis.

06:40.936 --> 06:43.103
- It's nice to meet you.

06:43.147 --> 06:45.607
Alright Aubrey, I see
that your last period

06:45.650 --> 06:46.024
was April third.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.524
- Uh huh.

06:47.568 --> 06:48.859
- Okay, you should be
closing in on week 12.

06:48.944 --> 06:51.028
So,

06:51.071 --> 06:51.529
let's take a look.

06:51.573 --> 06:52.947
- Oh, okay.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.449
Oh, by the way,

06:54.492 --> 06:54.949
we don't want to know
the sex of the baby.

06:54.993 --> 06:55.742
- Alright.

06:58.539 --> 07:00.164
I like surprises also.

07:02.125 --> 07:03.708
A little pressure.

07:09.926 --> 07:11.134
Alright.

07:11.178 --> 07:12.469
Let's meet baby.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.187
I know who you remind me of.

07:23.273 --> 07:24.023
My father.

07:27.445 --> 07:28.527
There it is.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.032
- No.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.162
Wow.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.384
- [Child] Daddy's home.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.885
- [Mom] Hey baby.

07:55.685 --> 07:56.641
- [Dad] Who's my
little princess?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.268
- Me.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.435
- [Mom] And I'm the queen.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.937
- [Dad] I love you so much.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.273
- [Child] Love you too daddy.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.482
- [Mom] Alright,
dinner's ready, come on.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.650
- [Child] Okay.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.203
- [Woman] Jimmy.

08:15.247 --> 08:16.246
- [Man] Jimmy, get down.

08:16.373 --> 08:18.498
(screams)

08:21.587 --> 08:23.546
(sirens)

08:23.589 --> 08:24.713
- Mom.

08:24.756 --> 08:26.798
Who's my little princess?

08:26.842 --> 08:28.509
- [Man] Natalie.

08:28.553 --> 08:29.677
I love you.

08:29.721 --> 08:31.137
- [Natalie] Daddy.

08:32.974 --> 08:33.598
Daddy.

08:39.982 --> 08:40.522
- My baby.

08:54.497 --> 08:55.872
- [Natalie] Goddammit.

08:55.915 --> 08:57.665
- What's wrong doctor?

08:59.170 --> 09:01.628
- The damn IVF failed again.

09:01.756 --> 09:02.546
Got my period.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.924
- Well maybe now you
should try the natural way.

09:05.968 --> 09:08.218
You know, find a
man, and then get--

09:08.262 --> 09:10.846
- Finding a man
isn't the problem.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.641
- You know, you
sure are miserable

09:51.684 --> 09:55.228
for someone who got
everything he ever wanted.

09:55.271 --> 09:56.855
That looks great.

09:56.899 --> 09:58.399
- This thing is a piece of crap,

09:58.442 --> 10:00.025
just like my show is.

10:00.069 --> 10:00.859
- Hey.

10:02.738 --> 10:04.613
- Babe, I just never
saw myself writing

10:04.657 --> 10:06.698
a family sitcom.

10:06.742 --> 10:08.075
I still want to

10:08.119 --> 10:09.953
care about something.

10:09.996 --> 10:11.704
- Okay, well,

10:11.748 --> 10:13.706
care about being a dad.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.458
You're gonna be a great dad.

10:15.502 --> 10:17.669
- I do care about that, alright.

10:17.712 --> 10:18.294
Just,

10:19.714 --> 10:22.133
not sure if I'm ready
for it, that's all.

10:22.176 --> 10:23.634
- Okay, come on, no one's
ever ready to be a parent.

10:23.678 --> 10:25.094
You kind of just have to

10:25.138 --> 10:26.762
go with the flow, you know.

10:26.806 --> 10:29.723
(phone rings)

10:29.767 --> 10:30.599
Hello?

10:31.727 --> 10:33.060
Hi Dr. Barnson.

10:33.229 --> 10:34.186
Okay, Natalie.

10:37.776 --> 10:38.567
Tomorrow.

10:39.486 --> 10:40.778
Yeah.

10:40.822 --> 10:42.155
Sure, what time?

10:44.450 --> 10:45.240
Okay.

10:48.037 --> 10:48.995
Okay.

10:50.999 --> 10:51.789
Yeah.

10:53.502 --> 10:55.627
Alright, I'll see you then.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.337
- What is it?

10:58.381 --> 11:00.299
- She said one of the test
I took was inconclusive

11:00.342 --> 11:02.759
so she wants me to come
in and redo it, so.

11:02.803 --> 11:05.179
- I'm sure it's
gonna be alright.

11:06.808 --> 11:07.807
- Yeah.

11:09.227 --> 11:10.642
- Thanks for coming in
at such short notice.

11:10.686 --> 11:13.188
Like I said, everything
looks perfectly normal,

11:13.231 --> 11:15.690
it's just there was a
problem with the lab, so.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.400
Unfortunately, we
have to redo your pap.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.193
- Okay.

11:19.989 --> 11:21.030
- Alright.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.199
Little cold, sorry.

11:24.576 --> 11:25.200
There we go.

11:38.967 --> 11:39.925
All done.

11:42.930 --> 11:43.512
Alright.

11:43.555 --> 11:44.889
- Thanks.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.641
- You can get dressed.

12:05.330 --> 12:06.119
- [Matt] Hi babe.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.496
- Hi.

12:07.623 --> 12:08.205
- [Matt] Where are you?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.458
- I'm back here.

12:10.502 --> 12:11.584
- What a day.

12:13.213 --> 12:13.878
Oh, hello.

12:15.799 --> 12:16.674
- Hi.

12:16.717 --> 12:18.092
Am I getting stretchmarks?

12:18.135 --> 12:20.969
- Babe, you're not even showing.

12:21.012 --> 12:22.680
- You didn't even look.

12:29.398 --> 12:30.230
- Should we do it?

12:30.274 --> 12:31.273
- Definitely.

12:32.484 --> 12:33.567
- Will it hurt the baby?

12:33.610 --> 12:34.858
- I don't know.

12:34.902 --> 12:35.860
Should we ask him?

12:35.904 --> 12:37.070
- Don't say things like that.

12:37.114 --> 12:39.239
You're gonna spoil the mood.

12:39.283 --> 12:41.157
- Okay, I wouldn't do that.

12:41.201 --> 12:43.536
(soft music)

12:53.506 --> 12:54.130
(dramatic music)

12:54.173 --> 12:55.173
Oh my god, Matt.

12:55.217 --> 12:56.174
Matt, we got bleeds.

12:56.218 --> 12:57.175
Oh god, call the doctor, okay.

12:57.219 --> 12:58.385
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.261
I'm gonna call.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.888
I'm calling.

13:00.932 --> 13:01.888
I'm calling.

13:02.933 --> 13:04.141
- Oh no.

13:04.184 --> 13:04.975
Oh.

13:06.645 --> 13:07.437
God.

13:09.024 --> 13:11.899
- Could sex have
caused the bleeding?

13:13.278 --> 13:14.653
- It's possible.

13:16.031 --> 13:18.823
I take it you had
sex last night.

13:23.039 --> 13:24.622
- Would you two
mind waiting here?

13:24.665 --> 13:26.040
I'll be right back.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.834
You can get dressed.

13:30.588 --> 13:33.757
(soft music)

13:54.782 --> 13:55.989
- My friend Nicole
had a miscarriage

13:56.033 --> 13:58.867
and she hasn't been
able to conceive since.

13:58.911 --> 14:00.035
- Babe, that's not gonna happen.

14:00.079 --> 14:01.912
You're gonna be fine.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.208
- Okay, first and foremost,

14:05.251 --> 14:07.085
the baby looks great.

14:07.128 --> 14:10.088
However, at this
point of gestation,

14:10.131 --> 14:12.131
there's a higher risk
for preterm labor

14:12.175 --> 14:14.425
when the cervical length is
less than 25 milliliters.

14:14.469 --> 14:16.260
Aubrey, yours is at 19.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.182
Here.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.812
This is Aubrey's uterus
in statural view.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.397
You can see that the
cervical length is shortened.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.107
That gives us a
strong indication that

14:28.150 --> 14:29.900
Aubrey you're developing
what's known as

14:29.944 --> 14:31.319
an incompetent cervix.

14:31.363 --> 14:32.404
- Oh, great.

14:32.447 --> 14:33.780
My cervix is a bumbling idiot.

14:33.824 --> 14:36.409
- Cervical competence
isn't something

14:36.452 --> 14:37.993
that's routinely checked

14:38.037 --> 14:40.078
unless there's been a history
of preterm pregnancies,

14:40.122 --> 14:42.664
or some trauma to the cervix,

14:42.708 --> 14:43.708
like a,

14:43.751 --> 14:44.792
a lead procedure,

14:44.836 --> 14:47.086
or a comb biopsy.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.715
Now, with this recent episode
of cramping and bleeding,

14:49.758 --> 14:52.050
I thought we should take a look.

14:52.094 --> 14:53.843
And I'm glad we did.

14:53.886 --> 14:55.094
- Okay, so what does
that mean for the baby?

14:55.138 --> 14:57.431
- Well, we want it healthy

14:57.474 --> 14:58.974
and full term, right.

14:59.017 --> 15:00.767
- Uh huh.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.395
- Well, then we're gonna have
to take some serious measures.

15:02.439 --> 15:04.731
I want to get you
started on progesterone

15:04.899 --> 15:07.607
and I want to see you weekly
so I can measure your cervix.

15:07.651 --> 15:09.026
- [Aubrey] Yeah, sure,
whatever it takes.

15:09.112 --> 15:09.777
- Good.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.572
I'm glad you feel that way

15:12.615 --> 15:15.075
because I don't think you're
gonna like the next part.

15:15.119 --> 15:17.077
We need to put
Aubrey on bedrest.

15:17.121 --> 15:19.079
- Sure, but what does

15:20.582 --> 15:22.708
being on your back for
the next five months

15:22.752 --> 15:23.876
gonna do the help?

15:23.919 --> 15:27.296
- It's going to keep
Aubrey horizontal.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.506
We don't want the
cervix contracting

15:28.550 --> 15:31.634
or you could go
into preterm labor.

15:31.678 --> 15:33.052
Now that doesn't
mean you can't get up

15:33.096 --> 15:34.220
for short periods of time

15:34.347 --> 15:35.346
to stretch or

15:35.390 --> 15:36.931
to use the restroom.

15:36.975 --> 15:37.849
But, unfortunately,

15:37.893 --> 15:39.142
anything

15:39.186 --> 15:42.646
more than 30 minutes
could be damaging.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.524
We want this baby to cook
as long as possible, right.

15:45.568 --> 15:47.235
- [Aubrey] Of course.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.611
- Oh, and,

15:48.654 --> 15:51.363
there's just one more thing.

15:51.407 --> 15:52.156
No sex,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.284
of any kind.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.660
And,

15:55.704 --> 15:58.997
I'm sorry, but that
means no orgasms either,

15:59.041 --> 16:01.334
at least for Aubrey.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.292
- [Matt] Sure, of course.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.502
Not a problem.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.088
- Good.

16:10.512 --> 16:11.929
I'll see you next week.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.598
(dramatic music)

16:16.184 --> 16:20.229
- I don't think I can do
a six month term in here.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.731
- What about work?

16:22.775 --> 16:26.361
- They said I could
work remotely for now.

16:27.697 --> 16:28.780
Hey, is this your show?

16:28.824 --> 16:29.863
- [Matt] Yes it is.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.408
They're airing
the pilot tonight.

16:32.452 --> 16:34.244
They're having a big
party down at Mulligan's.

16:34.287 --> 16:36.371
The whole crew is down there.

16:36.414 --> 16:37.038
- Wanna go?

16:37.082 --> 16:38.666
- No.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.793
No, no, no, no.

16:40.837 --> 16:43.379
I can't bear to be in
a room full of silence

16:43.421 --> 16:45.297
when it's supposed
to be a comedy.

16:45.341 --> 16:46.131
- Stop.

16:51.056 --> 16:53.640
- [Woman On TV] We're a family.

16:53.684 --> 16:55.851
(laughter)

16:55.894 --> 16:56.686
Time's up.

17:07.866 --> 17:10.367
- [Man] Natalie, your
name is naturally Kala.

17:10.411 --> 17:12.785
These are your real parents.

17:14.205 --> 17:18.083
- [Woman] We're finally
going to be a family again.

17:18.919 --> 17:20.627
Is it my fault you
haven't touched me in

17:20.671 --> 17:22.255
in I don't know how long.

17:22.299 --> 17:24.299
- [Man] Oh, yeah,
well not long enough.

17:24.342 --> 17:26.049
- [Woman] You're a piece
of shit, you know that?

17:26.093 --> 17:27.217
- [Man] Yeah, I'm a
little piece of shit.

17:27.261 --> 17:28.803
- [Woman] Don't you
walk away from me.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.431
(dramatic music)

17:34.812 --> 17:36.061
- Hey princess.

17:38.316 --> 17:40.315
- [Young Natalie] Stop.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.942
No, no.

17:41.986 --> 17:43.485
(screams)

17:43.529 --> 17:45.112
- Hey lady.

17:45.156 --> 17:47.031
Got any change?

17:47.074 --> 17:48.116
A hundred.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.869
(somber music)

18:33.751 --> 18:36.084
(phone rings)

18:39.048 --> 18:40.214
- San Quintin.

18:40.257 --> 18:41.924
(laughter)

18:41.968 --> 18:43.884
- Very funny.

18:43.928 --> 18:45.512
I was just calling to
ask how you're doing.

18:45.597 --> 18:46.763
- Pretty good, but
the housekeeper failed

18:46.807 --> 18:48.847
- Are you kidding me?

18:48.891 --> 18:50.391
She didn't show up
last time either.

18:50.476 --> 18:52.018
God.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.853
I gotta get you some good help.

18:53.897 --> 18:55.855
Thank god she's not
on auto pay, right.

18:55.899 --> 18:59.068
- Hey, do you have to
go to the gym tonight?

18:59.112 --> 19:01.612
- I haven't been in
a while, so I could.

19:01.656 --> 19:03.196
- Okay.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.865
Can you pick me up
Chinese food later?

19:04.909 --> 19:06.742
- [Matt] Sweet and sour pork?

19:06.786 --> 19:07.451
- Chicken.

19:08.830 --> 19:09.870
- Yes, yes.

19:09.914 --> 19:11.039
Yes, chicken.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.708
The pork's for me.

19:12.751 --> 19:13.959
- Okay, well I love you babe.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.002
I'll see you later.

19:15.045 --> 19:15.919
- [Matt] Love you too babe.

19:15.963 --> 19:17.087
- Okay bye.

19:17.131 --> 19:18.672
- Bye.

19:18.716 --> 19:21.383
(dramatic music)

20:02.096 --> 20:03.137
- Hi Mr. Lewis.

20:04.891 --> 20:06.098
- Matt, actually.

20:07.895 --> 20:09.102
Fancy seeing you here.

20:09.146 --> 20:11.313
- Oh, yeah, I just joined.

20:11.356 --> 20:12.396
- Oh.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.522
- You like working out here?

20:13.566 --> 20:16.568
- Aubrey likes me
to work out here.

20:16.612 --> 20:18.236
She's afraid I'm gonna
get writer's belly.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.323
- I think you look great.

20:23.161 --> 20:24.035
- Well, in reality,

20:24.079 --> 20:25.619
I hate the gym.

20:25.662 --> 20:26.913
- Yeah, you and me both.

20:26.956 --> 20:29.082
- Doesn't look like it.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.209
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

20:31.252 --> 20:33.087
- [Matt] That they can.

20:35.299 --> 20:37.633
- How are you Matt?

20:37.676 --> 20:38.717
How are you doing?

20:38.761 --> 20:40.219
- I don't know.

20:40.262 --> 20:41.553
No one's asked me that
in a very long time.

20:41.597 --> 20:43.138
All the questions are
about Aubrey and the baby

20:43.182 --> 20:45.057
and never about Matt.

20:46.061 --> 20:48.061
And that sounded
extremely selfish.

20:48.105 --> 20:51.689
- Well actually I think
it sounded honest.

20:51.733 --> 20:52.942
- I don't know.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.821
- I like honest people.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.910
Matt, you know

21:02.954 --> 21:06.540
pregnancy is a time where
relationships change.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.082
Things are bound to be different

21:08.126 --> 21:09.792
from the time it was
just the two of you.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.043
You know,

21:11.087 --> 21:13.880
it's normal to feel overwhelmed.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.215
- No, is it normal for your

21:15.259 --> 21:17.217
wife to go off the pill
without telling you?

21:17.261 --> 21:18.553
Is that normal?

21:19.764 --> 21:21.221
- Unplanned, huh?

21:23.308 --> 21:25.101
That's interesting.

21:25.145 --> 21:26.060
- As a matter of fact,

21:26.104 --> 21:27.562
she told the news

21:27.605 --> 21:30.064
the exact day I found
out I was being promoted

21:30.108 --> 21:31.984
to executive producer
on Family Phun, so.

21:32.027 --> 21:33.861
- Big fan by the way.

21:33.904 --> 21:35.194
- Yeah?

21:35.238 --> 21:37.114
At the end of the day I guess

21:37.158 --> 21:40.075
she got everything she
wanted out of it you know.

21:40.119 --> 21:41.076
New house,

21:41.120 --> 21:42.077
new money,

21:42.121 --> 21:43.746
new baby.

21:43.790 --> 21:45.039
- What about you?

21:47.085 --> 21:49.752
Did you get
everything you wanted?

21:55.260 --> 21:57.845
- I haven't figured
that out yet.

22:03.728 --> 22:04.685
- I got to go.

22:04.729 --> 22:07.021
Mrs. Reedy's in labor.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.272
Twins.

22:08.316 --> 22:10.317
See, life could be worse.

22:12.821 --> 22:13.820
See you around.

22:13.864 --> 22:14.613
- Yep.

22:32.926 --> 22:33.716
Janelle?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.595
- Shocked to see me?

22:36.639 --> 22:38.180
- Well, I'm shocked to see
you cleaning something,

22:38.224 --> 22:39.097
that's for sure.

22:39.141 --> 22:40.182
What are you doing here?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.476
- Aubrey said she
needed my help,

22:41.519 --> 22:43.937
and our father called
and laid it on thick.

22:43.980 --> 22:45.604
So here I am.

22:45.648 --> 22:46.605
Happy to help.

22:46.649 --> 22:47.982
Doing my best.

22:48.026 --> 22:49.734
- How much are we paying you?

22:49.778 --> 22:51.778
- Not enough for your BS.

22:53.199 --> 22:55.324
- You're using grout
cleaner, not glass cleaner.

22:55.368 --> 22:56.575
It's gonna streak.

22:56.619 --> 22:57.576
- Thank you Matt.

22:57.620 --> 22:58.493
So helpful.

23:02.667 --> 23:03.332
- [Matt] Come on, seriously?

23:03.376 --> 23:05.000
- What?

23:05.044 --> 23:06.836
- You know very well that
your sister cannot stand me.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.089
- Babe, you said I needed help,

23:09.132 --> 23:10.340
and she needs a job, so.

23:10.384 --> 23:12.300
- Yeah, but I figured
that we would hire

23:12.344 --> 23:13.301
a real nanny,

23:13.345 --> 23:14.636
not,

23:14.680 --> 23:15.595
- Come on, a nanny's for kids.

23:15.639 --> 23:16.596
- [Matt] Okay.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.555
- Okay, I need help.

23:17.599 --> 23:18.557
- Fine.

23:18.601 --> 23:19.892
I know,

23:19.936 --> 23:20.601
but can it be anyone
other than Janelle?

23:20.645 --> 23:21.769
- Okay, fine.

23:21.813 --> 23:22.687
Well if you want to quit,

23:22.730 --> 23:23.813
you know,

23:23.856 --> 23:24.814
and take care of me that's fine.

23:24.857 --> 23:26.816
We could snuggle all day.

23:26.859 --> 23:28.067
We'd be broke,

23:28.111 --> 23:29.652
just like old times.

23:33.242 --> 23:33.991
- They were good times.

23:34.034 --> 23:36.285
- So how was work?

23:36.328 --> 23:38.454
- Work was work.

23:38.498 --> 23:41.707
You know, I'm thinking about
writing a whole storyline

23:41.750 --> 23:44.419
where tiger mom gets knocked up.

23:44.462 --> 23:45.712
- Oh yeah?

23:45.755 --> 23:46.963
Let me guess,

23:47.007 --> 23:47.880
she goes on bedrest?

23:47.924 --> 23:48.881
- Yes.

23:48.925 --> 23:50.008
(laughter)

23:50.051 --> 23:51.176
She's the only one in the family

23:51.220 --> 23:52.261
who knows how to cook

23:52.305 --> 23:53.344
and she runs the
family restaurant.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.680
That is a huge setup

23:55.724 --> 23:57.391
for some serious
comedic dilemma.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.392
- Oh yeah, yeah,

23:58.561 --> 23:59.476
serious.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.311
- It is.

24:01.647 --> 24:03.940
I hate writing sitcoms.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.568
Yeah, Megan thinks
that I should hire

24:06.611 --> 24:09.612
a consultant for
the pregnancy part.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.906
So I was thinking
about that doctor,

24:11.950 --> 24:12.824
the new one.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.908
Benson.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.993
- Barnson.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.454
- Barnson.

24:16.497 --> 24:17.496
- Come on, you think
she'd have time for that?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.080
- Well, she said
she liked the show.

24:18.166 --> 24:18.956
- When?

24:20.084 --> 24:21.124
- The office.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.377
- While she was just, you know,

24:23.421 --> 24:24.795
finding the baby.

24:24.839 --> 24:25.963
She's like oh hey
- I don't remember exactly,

24:26.007 --> 24:27.590
- I love your sitcom

24:27.633 --> 24:29.051
- Specifically when it happened.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.469
I just remember
that she said it.

24:30.512 --> 24:30.969
- Okay, well I'm so
pregnant that I don't care.

24:31.013 --> 24:33.263
(soft music)

24:35.142 --> 24:36.099
(vibrating)

24:36.143 --> 24:37.059
Love you.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.101
- Love you.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.940
(slow suspenseful music)

24:56.999 --> 24:58.457
- Yeah, I think the
storyline is really smart.

24:58.501 --> 25:01.586
Alpha female breaks
through the glass ceiling

25:01.630 --> 25:03.379
only to find herself pregnant

25:03.422 --> 25:05.089
the day they open
the restaurant.

25:05.132 --> 25:07.550
I think it'll really resonate.

25:07.594 --> 25:08.676
- Yeah?

25:08.720 --> 25:09.636
- Yeah.

25:09.679 --> 25:10.637
I do.

25:10.722 --> 25:11.971
- Thanks.

25:12.015 --> 25:15.351
- [Woman] Matt,
Aubrey's on line two.

25:15.395 --> 25:19.479
- Just tell her that
I'll call her right back.

25:19.982 --> 25:20.981
- [Woman] You got it.

25:21.025 --> 25:21.816
- Thanks.

25:27.908 --> 25:29.533
- Why am I here Matt?

25:30.952 --> 25:33.078
- You're here as a
consultant on pregnancies,

25:33.122 --> 25:35.122
and getting compensated
rather well, I might add.

25:35.165 --> 25:37.916
- I don't need your money.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.751
- Okay.

25:42.424 --> 25:43.714
- You know, it's
not unusual for men

25:43.758 --> 25:45.174
to fear childbirth,

25:46.594 --> 25:49.387
especially if it's
their first one.

25:51.266 --> 25:55.144
They're afraid of how
their lives may be altered,

25:55.563 --> 25:57.271
how they're perceived,

26:00.192 --> 26:03.569
will women ever find
them attractive again.

26:06.366 --> 26:09.868
So their mind starts to wonder,

26:09.911 --> 26:10.452
maybe

26:14.124 --> 26:14.914
one

26:16.042 --> 26:16.833
last

26:16.878 --> 26:17.710
fling

26:20.131 --> 26:20.963
will be okay.

26:23.009 --> 26:24.050
- Hi.

26:24.094 --> 26:25.135
- Table read?

26:25.179 --> 26:27.470
- Yes, I know, five minutes.

26:28.347 --> 26:29.138
- Great.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.103
(chuckles)

26:36.483 --> 26:40.692
- So here are those notes
on procreation A to Z.

26:40.736 --> 26:43.988
Call me if you
have any questions.

26:44.032 --> 26:45.031
- Will do.

26:45.074 --> 26:46.782
Thanks, thanks again.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.345
(knock on door)

27:05.639 --> 27:06.221
- Oh hi.

27:07.765 --> 27:08.223
Who are you?

27:09.309 --> 27:10.016
- I'm Janelle.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.059
Who are you?

27:11.102 --> 27:12.477
- I'm Dr. Barnson.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.234
Can I come in?

27:20.029 --> 27:21.654
- Come in I guess.

27:37.673 --> 27:39.047
- Oh my gosh, hi.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.091
I wow,

27:41.177 --> 27:42.593
what a surprise,

27:42.637 --> 27:44.220
a doctor who makes house calls.

27:44.264 --> 27:45.388
- Oh yes, I always try to

27:45.431 --> 27:47.140
drop in on all my
bedrest patients.

27:47.184 --> 27:49.308
- Wow, you look
amazing by the way.

27:49.352 --> 27:50.226
I mean so beautiful.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.561
- You're sweet.

27:53.274 --> 27:55.607
And very pretty too.

27:57.695 --> 27:58.903
Oh I,

27:59.948 --> 28:01.864
I got this for you.

28:01.908 --> 28:03.615
- House calls and gifts.

28:03.659 --> 28:06.119
- It's just a little something.

28:07.789 --> 28:08.621
Here.

28:15.881 --> 28:17.672
It's good for the baby,

28:19.260 --> 28:21.093
and good for mommy.

28:21.137 --> 28:22.469
- Well that's

28:22.513 --> 28:24.723
really, really nice of you.

28:25.976 --> 28:27.892
- Did you want me to
defrost the chicken, or?

28:27.936 --> 28:29.019
- Yeah that would be great.

28:29.062 --> 28:30.854
And also if you could just

28:30.897 --> 28:32.188
take the sheets out of
the dryer and fold them

28:32.232 --> 28:33.189
while they're still hot

28:33.233 --> 28:33.982
the way I showed you then,

28:34.026 --> 28:34.816
- Sure.

28:36.445 --> 28:37.820
- [Aubrey] Thanks.

28:39.365 --> 28:40.823
- I see you got
yourself some help.

28:40.867 --> 28:42.158
- Yeah, it's my sister.

28:42.201 --> 28:43.368
I mean she and Matt
don't really get along,

28:43.412 --> 28:44.910
but she, you know,

28:44.954 --> 28:47.204
she's been super helpful.

28:47.248 --> 28:48.914
- Well, good for you.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.503
- Yeah.

28:53.547 --> 28:54.921
- I've seen some husbands
build up a lot of resentment

28:54.965 --> 28:57.342
when they have to take up
all that slack themselves,

28:57.385 --> 29:00.719
especially when they
have demanding careers.

29:03.016 --> 29:04.015
It's important for
a woman to know

29:04.059 --> 29:06.434
her role in the relationship,

29:07.812 --> 29:10.856
especially when there
are so may options.

29:14.277 --> 29:16.487
Like that neighbor of yours.

29:16.530 --> 29:17.946
Yes, I saw him.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.157
How could you miss him?

29:20.201 --> 29:21.785
What is he like 16?

29:21.828 --> 29:22.869
- No, oh god no.

29:22.913 --> 29:23.787
I think he's, you know,

29:23.830 --> 29:25.246
19 at least,

29:25.290 --> 29:26.246
college age for sure.

29:26.290 --> 29:27.373
But yeah,

29:27.416 --> 29:28.667
he's not hard to look at.

29:28.710 --> 29:32.003
- Well, you just
remember the rules.

29:32.047 --> 29:34.507
You don't want to get too hot.

29:40.932 --> 29:42.139
- Matt's told me that
you're doing some consulting

29:42.183 --> 29:43.224
on the show.

29:45.103 --> 29:46.727
- Well I gave him a binder
with some information.

29:46.771 --> 29:48.021
That's all, no big deal.

29:48.065 --> 29:48.855
- Well I think it is.

29:48.899 --> 29:49.898
- Yeah?

29:49.942 --> 29:50.941
- Yeah, you're,

29:50.984 --> 29:52.067
you know,

29:52.111 --> 29:54.152
show already feels
a lot more real.

29:54.405 --> 29:56.071
- That's good.

29:56.115 --> 29:56.947
- Yeah.

29:56.990 --> 29:57.698
That's great.

29:57.741 --> 29:58.615
That's what Matt wants,

29:58.659 --> 29:59.658
you know, more reality,

29:59.702 --> 30:00.576
less fluff.

30:00.620 --> 30:01.661
- Right.

30:01.705 --> 30:03.287
Well, I,

30:03.331 --> 30:06.583
I'm glad I'm able to
give him what he wants.

30:10.255 --> 30:11.963
Anyway, I,

30:12.006 --> 30:13.382
I should go.

30:18.013 --> 30:21.099
I look forward to
seeing you next week

30:21.143 --> 30:23.183
for your appointment.

30:28.316 --> 30:29.023
Bye.

30:36.575 --> 30:37.699
- Homework first.

30:37.743 --> 30:39.368
- But I don't have any homework.

30:39.495 --> 30:41.787
(chuckles)

30:41.873 --> 30:44.290
- It's so stupid.

30:44.334 --> 30:45.584
- Oh, Natalie came over today.

30:45.627 --> 30:46.418
- Natalie?

30:48.005 --> 30:49.004
- Uh huh.

30:49.089 --> 30:50.087
Dr. Barnson.

30:50.256 --> 30:51.798
- Oh.

30:51.842 --> 30:53.508
- She said she stops in on
all of her bed rest patients.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.509
- Well that's nice.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.427
- Yeah, so nice.

31:01.436 --> 31:02.769
Do you think she's pretty?

31:02.812 --> 31:03.936
No, I mean,

31:03.980 --> 31:05.646
beautiful.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.106
She's beautiful right.

31:09.778 --> 31:11.069
- Oh come on.

31:11.113 --> 31:13.155
I've never taken you
for the insecure type.

31:13.199 --> 31:14.656
Besides you know
that you are always

31:14.700 --> 31:17.035
the prettiest girl in the room.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.210
- I think I'd be friends
with her in real life.

31:25.253 --> 31:26.628
She even got me a Bluetooth
speaker for the baby

31:26.671 --> 31:27.670
and it plays soothing sounds.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.840
- That's really cool.

31:29.884 --> 31:31.090
That was sweet of her.

31:31.134 --> 31:31.966
- I know.

31:34.262 --> 31:35.429
- Nothing but the best
for my wife, right.

31:35.473 --> 31:36.555
(laughter)

31:36.599 --> 31:37.973
Yeah, come here.

31:39.018 --> 31:40.017
- No orgasms though.

31:40.061 --> 31:41.393
- Not for you.

31:41.437 --> 31:43.647
(laughter)

31:56.538 --> 31:58.745
(hissing)

32:25.402 --> 32:26.360
- Shhh, hey,

32:27.904 --> 32:28.987
it's okay.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.655
Shhh, hey.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.447
Shhh, hey.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.325
It's okay.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.326
It's okay.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.703
It's okay.

32:35.746 --> 32:36.537
It's okay.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.008
Let's take a look.

32:54.183 --> 32:56.016
Just a little pressure.

32:59.063 --> 33:01.856
(heavy breathing)

33:48.408 --> 33:49.241
- You okay?

33:50.118 --> 33:51.910
- Yeah.

33:51.954 --> 33:54.037
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

33:54.081 --> 33:54.996
I'm good.

33:59.796 --> 34:03.048
(slow suspenseful music)ful)

34:18.524 --> 34:20.065
- Hi.

34:20.109 --> 34:22.443
You said you wanted to talk?

34:24.155 --> 34:25.154
What's?

34:27.618 --> 34:29.076
Hey, can you--

34:29.120 --> 34:31.120
- I said I need to see you.

34:33.749 --> 34:36.333
(dramatic music)

35:01.696 --> 35:02.611
- I can't.

35:02.655 --> 35:05.281
(dramatic music)

35:33.606 --> 35:34.772
- What are you doing here?

35:34.815 --> 35:36.148
- I saw you with that man.

35:36.192 --> 35:37.525
I hope you're not in any
kind of relationship.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.778
He looked just like that
sick man that kidnapped you.

35:39.821 --> 35:41.153
- Oh would you shut up.

35:41.197 --> 35:42.321
Haven't I sent you enough money

35:42.364 --> 35:44.324
to keep you out of my life?

35:44.367 --> 35:46.159
- Your father died a week ago

35:46.203 --> 35:47.827
and you didn't even call me.

35:47.871 --> 35:49.037
- My father died when
I was eight years old.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.831
- Oh stop it.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.917
That mongrel was
not your father.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.210
You got to

35:54.253 --> 35:55.668
stop that nonsense or,

35:55.712 --> 35:57.630
I'm gonna tell the patients
the truth about you.

35:57.673 --> 35:59.548
- You're gonna expose my truth,

35:59.717 --> 36:01.425
my truth?

36:01.469 --> 36:02.844
What about Frank's sick
molesting truth mother, huh?

36:02.888 --> 36:04.137
- Oh enough.

36:04.181 --> 36:04.679
- Or the fact that
you stood up for him

36:04.723 --> 36:05.889
for 10 years.

36:05.933 --> 36:08.141
Huh, how about that truth.

36:08.185 --> 36:11.061
You're still
standing up for him.

36:11.105 --> 36:11.812
- I tried.

36:13.273 --> 36:14.606
I really tried.

36:17.946 --> 36:20.738
- Turning a blind
eye is hardly trying.

36:23.493 --> 36:25.785
- I'm staying at the
Quiet Neck Motel.

36:25.829 --> 36:27.912
He left a few things to you.

36:29.125 --> 36:29.957
- Burn them.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.877
- I'm here for three days.

37:04.162 --> 37:05.494
What are you doing here?

37:05.538 --> 37:08.373
(suspenseful music)

37:27.521 --> 37:28.979
- It's too realistic.

37:29.023 --> 37:29.897
It's a situational comedy,

37:29.940 --> 37:32.065
not a lesson in preterm labor.

37:32.109 --> 37:32.941
- It's edgy and fresh.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.902
The comedy is there.

37:34.945 --> 37:36.695
The network is
just not seeing it.

37:36.739 --> 37:37.738
- Rewrite by 9:00 a.m.

37:37.781 --> 37:39.115
or we're both done.

37:39.159 --> 37:39.866
- Fine.

37:48.418 --> 37:51.879
(slow suspenseful music)

38:15.989 --> 38:16.822
Damn.

38:18.868 --> 38:19.700
Hello.

38:23.499 --> 38:24.373
I'm here.

38:35.177 --> 38:35.969
Natalie.

38:38.014 --> 38:38.930
Natalie.

38:39.933 --> 38:41.640
- [Natalie] In here.

39:08.298 --> 39:09.170
- This is--

39:13.803 --> 39:17.054
(slow suspenseful music)

40:05.817 --> 40:07.859
(doorbell)

40:11.741 --> 40:12.406
Oh no.

40:26.965 --> 40:27.881
- She came to see me at work.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.510
My father died a few weeks ago.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.803
Are you sure it's a suicide?

40:34.056 --> 40:35.472
- Oh yeah.

40:35.516 --> 40:39.185
Hung herself with a
towel in the bathroom.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.395
- Where is she?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.400
- At the morgue, downtown.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.778
- Okay, I'll make arrangements
with the funeral home.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.072
- Like I said, really sorry.

40:50.116 --> 40:51.782
- [Natalie] Thank you
Detective Goodwin.

40:51.826 --> 40:53.617
- [Detective] Have
a good evening.

40:53.661 --> 40:55.119
- [Natalie] You too.

40:59.334 --> 41:00.791
- What was that about?

41:00.835 --> 41:03.920
- Oh, a patient killed herself.

41:03.964 --> 41:05.713
- What?

41:05.757 --> 41:06.881
I'm so sorry.

41:06.925 --> 41:08.634
That's horrible, I--

41:08.678 --> 41:11.679
(slow suspenseful music)

41:13.598 --> 41:15.057
I really have to--

41:20.440 --> 41:22.023
- I really have to

41:23.235 --> 41:24.526
return a favor.

41:35.832 --> 41:37.832
- Didn't realize you were home.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.542
- [Matt] Oh yep, I am.

41:40.838 --> 41:43.129
- How'd the meeting go?

41:43.173 --> 41:45.590
- Oh you know, it went fine.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.801
Just a meeting.

41:47.845 --> 41:49.094
I decided I'm gonna stick
with my old agent, you know.

41:49.138 --> 41:52.264
He's been there with me
since the beginning, so.

41:52.308 --> 41:53.475
- That's good.

41:56.479 --> 41:57.227
I was just

41:57.271 --> 41:58.061
surprised,

41:59.483 --> 42:01.065
you know that you
didn't say hi to me.

42:01.109 --> 42:02.484
You just jumped

42:02.527 --> 42:03.485
right in the shower.

42:03.528 --> 42:04.694
It's kind of weird.

42:04.738 --> 42:05.779
- I know I'm sorry babe,

42:05.823 --> 42:07.615
it's just been

42:07.658 --> 42:09.199
a really long day.

42:12.037 --> 42:13.245
But I'm home now.

42:17.210 --> 42:18.292
And I love you.

42:20.047 --> 42:21.296
- I love you too.

42:23.424 --> 42:26.843
(slow suspenseful music)

42:51.705 --> 42:54.164
(phone ringing)

42:57.128 --> 42:58.753
- [Natalie] Busy boy.

42:58.797 --> 43:00.213
- Well I would think
the same about you.

43:00.257 --> 43:03.133
- Well, never to return
calls to people I care about.

43:03.177 --> 43:05.969
- That wasn't me
the other night.

43:07.180 --> 43:09.347
- Well maybe it wasn't
who you want to be.

43:09.391 --> 43:11.016
- [Matt] Exactly.

43:11.060 --> 43:11.850
- Right.

43:12.895 --> 43:14.061
Yeah, I know Matt.

43:14.105 --> 43:15.187
I know you.

43:18.235 --> 43:19.400
Meet me for coffee.

43:19.443 --> 43:20.901
- Natalie, it--

43:20.945 --> 43:23.238
- [Natalie] Come on, I've
got some notes for you.

43:23.282 --> 43:24.322
- Email them.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.700
Okay,

43:26.743 --> 43:28.076
just email them.

43:29.622 --> 43:32.081
(soft music)

43:57.235 --> 43:58.067
- Hey.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.068
- Hey.

44:00.112 --> 44:01.112
- How are you?

44:01.156 --> 44:02.947
I come bearing gifts.

44:04.743 --> 44:06.367
- Oh gosh, thank you.

44:06.411 --> 44:07.161
So sweet.

44:08.331 --> 44:09.580
I've been eating
like a cow lately.

44:09.624 --> 44:11.290
It's the only thing I
have to look forward to.

44:11.334 --> 44:12.291
- Oh, come on, you have

44:12.335 --> 44:13.876
the baby,

44:13.919 --> 44:14.918
you have Matt.

44:14.962 --> 44:16.003
Oh, by the way,

44:16.047 --> 44:17.171
his hard work is
really paying off.

44:17.214 --> 44:19.633
I am loving the pregnancy arch.

44:19.676 --> 44:20.634
The finale,

44:21.470 --> 44:22.802
well that got kicked back, but,

44:22.846 --> 44:24.137
- Yeah, I heard.

44:24.181 --> 44:25.513
By the way,

44:25.557 --> 44:26.682
it was a really
great idea you had

44:26.726 --> 44:28.141
bringing on Dr. Barnson
as a consultant.

44:28.185 --> 44:29.309
- Oh I wish I could take credit,

44:29.353 --> 44:31.061
but it was Matt's idea

44:32.398 --> 44:33.397
and it is a good one.

44:33.441 --> 44:34.940
I mean the show's
numbers are up.

44:34.984 --> 44:36.025
Makes me very happy,

44:36.069 --> 44:36.859
and more importantly,

44:36.903 --> 44:38.110
it makes the network happy.

44:38.154 --> 44:39.237
No, no, no, no.

44:41.367 --> 44:42.490
Here honey.

44:42.533 --> 44:45.160
Hormones on aisle three.

44:45.204 --> 44:46.078
- I'm okay.

44:47.122 --> 44:48.080
I'm just,

44:48.123 --> 44:49.331
I'm a mess.

44:49.375 --> 44:50.415
- You know, look,

44:50.459 --> 44:52.418
I know how tough
this incompetent

44:52.462 --> 44:54.462
cervix thing is.

44:54.506 --> 44:56.129
It's just,

44:56.173 --> 44:57.840
it's really bad luck.

44:57.884 --> 44:59.926
- What if it's not bad luck?

44:59.969 --> 45:01.469
- What are you talking about?

45:01.513 --> 45:04.556
- I've been carrying
this around for weeks now

45:04.600 --> 45:06.016
and you can't say anything okay.

45:06.060 --> 45:07.601
- Okay.

45:07.645 --> 45:08.435
- Okay.

45:10.313 --> 45:11.814
When Matt and I
were first married,

45:13.567 --> 45:15.359
when we got pregnant,

45:16.153 --> 45:19.239
and I,

45:19.282 --> 45:22.158
I obviously didn't
have the baby, I,

45:24.913 --> 45:26.413
I had a miscarriage.

45:28.625 --> 45:31.210
And I was reading online that

45:31.254 --> 45:33.421
if you had a miscarriage and

45:33.464 --> 45:36.550
you could have this
thing that's called

45:36.593 --> 45:38.300
an incompetent cervix.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.261
I just,

45:41.264 --> 45:44.182
what if I'm never
gonna be a mom.

45:44.226 --> 45:47.227
I mean, what if
something happens and,

45:47.271 --> 45:50.022
I named the first baby
Theodore after my grandfather.

45:50.066 --> 45:51.064
And,

45:52.276 --> 45:53.358
I'm,

45:53.402 --> 45:54.401
I'm sorry.

45:54.445 --> 45:55.403
I shouldn't--

45:55.447 --> 45:58.072
(dramatic music)

46:07.960 --> 46:09.084
What the hell?

46:14.760 --> 46:16.468
What is she doing?

46:16.511 --> 46:18.303
(phone rings)

46:18.346 --> 46:19.720
Are you following me?

46:19.764 --> 46:20.597
- I own you.

46:22.392 --> 46:23.767
- [Matt] No, no.

46:34.113 --> 46:35.196
- Sorry, I'd love to chat,

46:35.239 --> 46:37.656
but I'm late for a baby shower.

46:44.249 --> 46:45.624
- This is crazy.

47:04.312 --> 47:05.312
- [Neighbor] Who's that?

47:05.356 --> 47:06.522
- That's my sister's doctor.

47:06.565 --> 47:09.066
- What the hell are
you doing here, huh?

47:09.109 --> 47:10.067
- What?

47:11.446 --> 47:14.154
- Listen, I might not
be able to stop you

47:14.198 --> 47:15.697
from being Aubrey's doctor,

47:15.741 --> 47:17.115
but showing up to
her baby shower,

47:17.159 --> 47:18.701
that's just cruel.

47:18.745 --> 47:21.287
- Oh, there's nothing cruel
about celebrating a life.

47:21.331 --> 47:23.164
(inaudible)

47:23.208 --> 47:24.040
Come on.

47:25.753 --> 47:27.545
- I'll tell you one thing,

47:27.588 --> 47:30.171
I will take hemorrhoids
over postpartum depression

47:30.215 --> 47:31.757
any day.

47:31.801 --> 47:33.968
- Oh, my sister had post
and prenatal depression.

47:34.011 --> 47:35.469
- What?

47:35.513 --> 47:37.013
- Oh don't worry.

47:37.057 --> 47:39.307
It'll all be worth
it in the end.

47:39.351 --> 47:40.392
- Yah huh huh.

47:40.435 --> 47:42.059
Yeah, easy for you guys to say.

47:42.103 --> 47:44.604
You're not the one
who's pregnant.

47:44.648 --> 47:45.897
- Oh Natalie, hi.

47:45.941 --> 47:47.023
Great to see you.
- Hi.

47:47.067 --> 47:49.442
- Let me take this
for you honey.

47:49.486 --> 47:50.695
- Thank you.

47:50.738 --> 47:51.779
- Oh my god, what
did you get them.

47:51.823 --> 47:52.780
- Oh it's

47:52.824 --> 47:54.073
a little much.

47:54.117 --> 47:56.033
But then again, so am I.

47:58.621 --> 48:00.997
Oh wow, look at you.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.081
You look lovely.

48:02.125 --> 48:03.250
- Oh, I look like a pig.

48:03.294 --> 48:04.918
- No, no, no, no.

48:10.175 --> 48:11.258
You're glowing.

48:15.599 --> 48:17.181
- So I'm fascinated.

48:17.225 --> 48:18.308
Why gynecology?

48:20.061 --> 48:21.437
- Why not.

48:21.480 --> 48:22.229
I've always been interested
in the process of life.

48:22.273 --> 48:24.230
Why a TV producer?

48:24.274 --> 48:26.274
- Oh, because there is just

48:26.318 --> 48:29.069
nothing more rewarding
than my shows

48:29.113 --> 48:31.196
changing someone's
life for good.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.323
- Oh, come on.

48:32.366 --> 48:34.200
- It's for the glitz
and the glamor.

48:34.244 --> 48:37.120
- Yeah right,
that's more like it.

48:44.212 --> 48:45.879
You know, I've
actually been thinking

48:45.923 --> 48:48.090
of an interesting pregnancy
complication for the show.

48:48.134 --> 48:49.091
- Really, well,

48:49.135 --> 48:50.718
what is it?

48:50.762 --> 48:52.385
- Well,

48:52.429 --> 48:56.223
you know how Matt wants
things to be more real, right.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.268
Well let's just say
everything is going smoothly

48:59.312 --> 49:01.438
with the pregnancy,

49:01.482 --> 49:03.649
right up until delivery.

49:03.692 --> 49:05.691
Mother needs an
emergency c-section,

49:05.735 --> 49:06.777
and during the procedure,

49:06.820 --> 49:09.196
an artery is accidentally cut.

49:09.239 --> 49:12.617
Doctor has to choose
between baby and momma.

49:13.954 --> 49:15.453
Doctor chooses baby.

49:17.207 --> 49:18.623
- It's a sitcom.

49:19.668 --> 49:21.334
- Well today's audiences
are sophisticated.

49:21.378 --> 49:23.670
I'm sure they can
handle a little blood.

49:23.713 --> 49:26.382
- And, the killing of
the main character?

49:26.425 --> 49:28.467
- Matt is a terrific writer.

49:28.511 --> 49:30.928
He could easily come up
with a replacement mother

49:30.972 --> 49:32.222
for the family.

49:34.809 --> 49:36.141
- You're a hoot.

49:37.645 --> 49:40.605
I never realized
you were so funny.

49:40.649 --> 49:43.441
(nervous laughter)

49:44.862 --> 49:46.153
Gather around everyone.

49:46.197 --> 49:47.779
So this game is called

49:47.823 --> 49:48.822
name that baby.

49:48.865 --> 49:49.864
Now, in each balloon,

49:49.908 --> 49:51.742
there's a slip of paper

49:51.786 --> 49:53.160
with your choice
of babies names.

49:53.204 --> 49:54.537
And in one balloon,

49:54.580 --> 49:56.288
Aubrey put the correct answer.

49:56.332 --> 49:57.082
So, ready,

49:59.837 --> 50:00.626
and go.

50:02.505 --> 50:04.089
- Oops.

50:04.133 --> 50:05.090
- Okay, I have

50:05.134 --> 50:07.050
Alison or Steve.

50:07.094 --> 50:08.427
- No.

50:08.470 --> 50:11.139
- [Woman] Henry and June.

50:11.182 --> 50:12.932
Say this one is pervy.

50:14.185 --> 50:15.892
(laughter)

50:15.936 --> 50:17.311
- I'll have to remember that

50:17.355 --> 50:21.107
in case we ever get
pregnant with twins.

50:21.151 --> 50:24.153
- Well this one just
has a boy's name on it.

50:24.196 --> 50:25.029
Theodore.

50:28.366 --> 50:31.201
(dramatic music)

50:41.089 --> 50:42.464
Is everything okay?

50:45.135 --> 50:46.051
- Yeah, yeah,

50:46.094 --> 50:46.885
I just,

50:47.763 --> 50:49.221
I'll be right back.

50:57.315 --> 50:59.148
- Okay, Vicky, well I'm sure
I will see you again soon.

50:59.192 --> 51:00.357
- Oh well,

51:00.401 --> 51:02.360
hopefully sooner
rather than later.

51:02.404 --> 51:05.280
- Hey, are you having an
affair with my brother in law?

51:05.324 --> 51:07.116
- Um, that's ridiculous,

51:07.160 --> 51:09.243
not to mention
totally inappropriate.

51:09.287 --> 51:10.368
- They practically came together

51:10.412 --> 51:12.079
and then Matt sped off.

51:12.122 --> 51:13.288
- Oh you saw Matt and I
in the same car together?

51:13.332 --> 51:15.917
- You arrived at the same time.

51:18.379 --> 51:20.672
- Look, I'm sorry if you
got the wrong impression,

51:20.716 --> 51:23.258
but not only would it
be completely unethical,

51:23.302 --> 51:25.510
and like Vicky said,

51:25.553 --> 51:27.012
extremely inappropriate

51:27.056 --> 51:28.931
to do anything near
your accusations,

51:28.974 --> 51:31.934
I would never be attracted
to someone like Matt.

51:31.977 --> 51:33.311
- And why is that?

51:36.191 --> 51:38.148
- Because I'm a lesbian dear.

51:38.192 --> 51:40.902
(dramatic music)

52:12.522 --> 52:15.690
(slow suspenseful music)

53:25.601 --> 53:26.391
- Natalie.

53:29.605 --> 53:30.604
Natalie.

53:36.529 --> 53:37.278
Natalie.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.476
- You're just in time.

54:05.520 --> 54:06.602
Dinner's ready.

54:17.073 --> 54:18.490
I knew you would come back.

54:18.534 --> 54:19.491
- Excuse me.

54:19.535 --> 54:20.492
No.

54:20.536 --> 54:21.618
No.

54:21.662 --> 54:23.078
- What?

54:23.122 --> 54:23.954
- How dare you record a
video of us having sex

54:23.997 --> 54:26.248
without me knowing,

54:26.292 --> 54:27.958
and then you have
the nerve to show up

54:28.002 --> 54:29.835
to my wife's baby shower

54:29.878 --> 54:31.629
acting like nothing happened.

54:31.673 --> 54:34.215
- You have sex with
your wife's obstetrician

54:34.259 --> 54:36.634
and act like nothing's happened.

54:36.678 --> 54:37.761
- One time Natalie.

54:37.805 --> 54:39.345
One time.

54:39.389 --> 54:40.513
- Yeah, you say that a lot.

54:40.557 --> 54:41.431
You say that a lot.

54:41.474 --> 54:42.223
- You better delete that video

54:42.267 --> 54:43.141
and do it now

54:43.184 --> 54:44.101
or I swear to god.

54:44.145 --> 54:45.519
- What?

54:45.563 --> 54:47.271
What are you gonna do?

54:49.734 --> 54:51.942
You gonna change doctors?

54:52.028 --> 54:52.776
Hmm?

54:55.948 --> 54:57.115
- You're sick.

54:58.327 --> 54:59.367
- Change doctors,

54:59.411 --> 55:01.870
you'll see how sick I really am.

55:09.505 --> 55:10.546
Are you sure I
can't convince you

55:10.590 --> 55:12.173
to stay for dinner?

55:14.093 --> 55:14.925
- Positive.

55:16.555 --> 55:19.722
(slow suspenseful music)

56:19.206 --> 56:20.580
You sure it's okay to be up?

56:20.624 --> 56:23.208
- Yeah, I'm tired
of eating in bed.

56:23.252 --> 56:24.501
What's wrong?

56:24.545 --> 56:27.004
Worried about the season finale?

56:27.048 --> 56:28.047
Hey, I read the script.

56:28.091 --> 56:29.256
It's great.

56:29.299 --> 56:30.507
- No, it's not great.

56:30.551 --> 56:31.716
- Okay, well if I
say that it's cute,

56:31.760 --> 56:33.553
you'll bite my ear off.

56:33.596 --> 56:34.637
- Well if you say
that it's cute,

56:34.681 --> 56:35.805
I know that you really mean

56:35.849 --> 56:36.639
it sucks.

56:38.686 --> 56:40.060
- What's wrong?

56:40.104 --> 56:40.853
- Nothing.

56:46.944 --> 56:48.444
- Jesus,

56:48.487 --> 56:50.989
I cannot wait til it's
just you and I here again.

56:51.032 --> 56:52.282
- And the baby.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.618
- Of course and the baby.

57:08.509 --> 57:09.508
Dammit.

57:10.887 --> 57:11.886
Do you mind

57:11.929 --> 57:13.554
not doing that?

57:13.598 --> 57:15.389
You scared the crap out of me.

57:15.433 --> 57:16.933
- Well you scare me too Matt.

57:16.977 --> 57:18.393
- What?

57:18.437 --> 57:19.519
- I know you're having an affair

57:19.563 --> 57:21.646
with my sister's gynecologist.

57:21.690 --> 57:23.608
- Have you lost your mind?

57:23.651 --> 57:24.524
- You can deny it all you want,

57:24.568 --> 57:25.442
but I know.

57:27.321 --> 57:28.653
(phone rings)

57:28.697 --> 57:29.655
- Jesus Chri--

57:29.699 --> 57:31.491
- Don't answer that.

57:31.534 --> 57:33.326
She doesn't deserve it.

57:35.706 --> 57:36.747
- It's Vicky.

57:40.543 --> 57:41.584
- You know, I know
something's up.

57:41.628 --> 57:44.505
And I know it's that woman.

57:44.548 --> 57:45.589
I can't tell my sister

57:45.633 --> 57:47.299
because of the stress

57:47.343 --> 57:49.010
and the potential harm
it could do the baby but,

57:49.054 --> 57:51.137
I am gonna tell you this,

57:52.515 --> 57:53.514
whatever is going on,

57:53.557 --> 57:55.266
you have to end it.

57:55.310 --> 57:56.768
Now.

57:56.811 --> 57:58.645
- The only thing
happening right now

57:58.688 --> 58:01.273
is I am missing an
important business call

58:01.317 --> 58:02.900
so if you don't mind,

58:02.944 --> 58:03.734
Janelle.

58:06.738 --> 58:08.614
- Not at all.

58:08.658 --> 58:12.076
(slow suspenseful music)

58:17.876 --> 58:21.127
- Definitely need to get
these couches steamed.

58:21.171 --> 58:22.754
It's starting to look like

58:22.798 --> 58:24.422
somebody's been mud
wrestling on them.

58:24.466 --> 58:25.257
And,

58:26.218 --> 58:27.009
oh crap.

58:29.681 --> 58:32.515
We want to get the
floors polished.

58:37.981 --> 58:39.606
And, that's all for now.

58:39.650 --> 58:42.484
Just get the notes
emailed to me.

58:47.450 --> 58:48.365
Hey.

58:48.409 --> 58:49.741
- Hey.

58:49.785 --> 58:50.617
- If anybody shows up
here asking for me,

58:50.661 --> 58:51.368
you tell them I went to lunch,

58:51.412 --> 58:52.453
alright?

58:52.497 --> 58:54.455
And I mean anybody.

58:54.499 --> 58:55.832
- You got it boss.

59:04.467 --> 59:05.467
- Hi.

59:05.511 --> 59:06.594
- Hello.

59:06.637 --> 59:07.553
- I'm here to see Matt.

59:07.597 --> 59:09.555
- Matt is not in the office.

59:09.599 --> 59:11.725
- I had an appointment with him.

59:11.768 --> 59:13.852
- But he's gone for lunch.

59:18.817 --> 59:20.191
- Would you please let him know

59:20.235 --> 59:23.486
that Natalie is waiting for him.

59:23.530 --> 59:25.364
- When I see him, I will.

59:25.408 --> 59:28.576
(slow suspenseful music)

59:30.121 --> 59:31.120
- No, I like it.

59:31.164 --> 59:32.288
I think it's good.

59:32.332 --> 59:33.205
No, it's okay, really.

59:33.249 --> 59:34.498
- Oh Natalie,

59:34.584 --> 59:35.333
hi.

59:37.588 --> 59:39.588
Do you have a second?

59:39.632 --> 59:40.464
- Uh huh.

1:00:01.154 --> 1:00:02.738
I don't know how Aubrey
lets Matt have you

1:00:02.782 --> 1:00:04.281
as a best friend.

1:00:06.535 --> 1:00:08.202
You are so

1:00:08.245 --> 1:00:09.037
beautiful.

1:00:10.582 --> 1:00:11.622
- And so gay.

1:00:13.042 --> 1:00:15.585
(laughter)

1:00:15.629 --> 1:00:16.628
- Still.

1:00:19.675 --> 1:00:21.926
I don't think I could do it.

1:00:36.777 --> 1:00:40.278
Do you think Matt would
make a good father?

1:00:40.322 --> 1:00:44.324
- That's the last thing that
i'm thinking about right now.

1:00:51.668 --> 1:00:52.541
- More wine?

1:00:52.584 --> 1:00:53.584
- Sure.

1:01:03.097 --> 1:01:04.221
Wow.

1:01:04.265 --> 1:01:05.765
That's pretty wild.

1:01:05.809 --> 1:01:06.598
- This?

1:01:08.310 --> 1:01:09.560
- It's a fertility statue

1:01:09.603 --> 1:01:11.228
from the 1890s.

1:01:11.272 --> 1:01:13.523
Up until the middle ages,

1:01:13.567 --> 1:01:16.609
women weren't allowed
to give birth indoors.

1:01:16.653 --> 1:01:17.861
- Thank you.

1:01:17.904 --> 1:01:18.904
- They had to go

1:01:18.948 --> 1:01:20.155
to the woods,

1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:20.989
or

1:01:22.117 --> 1:01:23.074
by a stream.

1:01:27.707 --> 1:01:30.958
It was just her and the midwife.

1:01:31.002 --> 1:01:32.627
And the midwife

1:01:32.671 --> 1:01:35.337
had to be an older woman

1:01:35.381 --> 1:01:38.467
who already had a
child of her own.

1:01:38.510 --> 1:01:40.802
- And why was that?

1:01:40.846 --> 1:01:44.807
- Maybe they thought that
she would steal the baby.

1:01:44.851 --> 1:01:46.184
- Oh.

1:01:46.227 --> 1:01:47.477
That's intense.

1:01:51.858 --> 1:01:53.441
So what about you?

1:01:54.861 --> 1:01:56.235
- What about me?

1:02:00.075 --> 1:02:01.575
Do I want to steal a baby?

1:02:01.619 --> 1:02:03.702
(laughter)

1:02:04.705 --> 1:02:07.080
- Do you want to have a baby?

1:02:09.753 --> 1:02:10.919
- Not tonight.

1:02:18.512 --> 1:02:19.469
- Seriously?

1:02:21.598 --> 1:02:23.015
I'd like to know.

1:02:28.607 --> 1:02:31.023
- I can't have children.

1:02:31.067 --> 1:02:31.857
- Oh.

1:02:36.698 --> 1:02:38.532
I'm sorry, I,

1:02:38.575 --> 1:02:39.741
- Yeah, see,

1:02:39.785 --> 1:02:41.577
that's exactly
what I didn't want.

1:02:41.621 --> 1:02:42.703
I, I,

1:02:42.747 --> 1:02:43.745
I hate pity.

1:02:45.165 --> 1:02:47.542
I really, really hate it.

1:02:47.585 --> 1:02:48.709
- No, I'm sorry.

1:02:48.753 --> 1:02:50.670
That was too personal.

1:02:52.632 --> 1:02:55.342
- Why are you here Vicky?

1:02:55.386 --> 1:02:57.176
- Cause you invited me.

1:02:58.471 --> 1:03:01.640
- No, I think
you're here because

1:03:01.684 --> 1:03:04.268
you wonder if Matt
ever hit on me.

1:03:06.063 --> 1:03:07.105
- What?

1:03:07.148 --> 1:03:09.065
- That's what I think.

1:03:09.109 --> 1:03:10.608
I think the very thought
of that turns you on.

1:03:10.652 --> 1:03:13.403
(dramatic music)

1:03:20.329 --> 1:03:22.079
Does that turn you on?

1:03:23.082 --> 1:03:24.498
Huh?

1:03:24.542 --> 1:03:25.623
Does it?

1:03:25.667 --> 1:03:27.167
- That's disgusting.

1:03:31.215 --> 1:03:32.215
- Your precious little Matt

1:03:32.259 --> 1:03:33.675
didn't need that much coercing.

1:03:33.719 --> 1:03:35.927
(screams)

1:03:44.354 --> 1:03:47.565
(slow suspenseful music)

1:04:02.082 --> 1:04:04.626
(phone rings)

1:04:10.675 --> 1:04:11.549
- Matt Lewis.

1:04:15.597 --> 1:04:17.806
- You're best friend is dead.

1:04:29.821 --> 1:04:31.821
- What's going on?

1:04:31.865 --> 1:04:33.365
Did we get canceled?

1:04:33.408 --> 1:04:35.909
- I just found out Vicky's dead.

1:04:40.624 --> 1:04:42.667
- I think I'm just
still in shock.

1:04:42.710 --> 1:04:45.378
Supposed to be some
kind of robbery?

1:04:45.421 --> 1:04:46.629
- So what then,

1:04:47.715 --> 1:04:49.173
a killer just strips her down

1:04:49.217 --> 1:04:50.508
and dumps her in the water

1:04:50.551 --> 1:04:51.842
like she's some
piece of garbage?

1:04:51.886 --> 1:04:52.927
- I know.

1:04:52.971 --> 1:04:53.886
It doesn't make any sense,

1:04:53.930 --> 1:04:54.930
very strange.

1:04:54.974 --> 1:04:56.473
- I just feel terrible.

1:04:56.517 --> 1:04:57.307
- Me too.

1:04:59.561 --> 1:05:01.228
Maybe we should

1:05:01.272 --> 1:05:02.854
stay close to home for while,

1:05:02.898 --> 1:05:05.023
switch back to Dr. Flickman.

1:05:05.067 --> 1:05:06.441
He's right down the street.

1:05:06.485 --> 1:05:08.069
- What?

1:05:08.113 --> 1:05:09.445
Well you can't just tell a woman

1:05:09.489 --> 1:05:10.613
who's 36 weeks pregnant

1:05:10.657 --> 1:05:12.156
that she needs to
change doctors Matt.

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:13.866
I mean why the hell would
you say something like that?

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:15.077
- I was just

1:05:15.121 --> 1:05:16.744
trying to do what's right

1:05:16.788 --> 1:05:18.538
and best for you and the baby.

1:05:18.581 --> 1:05:19.580
That's all.

1:05:19.624 --> 1:05:20.541
What's best for you

1:05:20.584 --> 1:05:21.917
is to say with Dr.

1:05:21.961 --> 1:05:23.502
Barnson,

1:05:23.546 --> 1:05:24.586
then that's fine.

1:05:24.630 --> 1:05:25.629
That's what's

1:05:25.715 --> 1:05:26.547
best.

1:05:30.678 --> 1:05:31.760
- Okay.

1:05:31.804 --> 1:05:33.471
I'm just emotional.

1:05:42.984 --> 1:05:44.899
- [Detective] Thank you for
coming in this time of night.

1:05:44.943 --> 1:05:45.901
I appreciate it.

1:05:45.945 --> 1:05:47.445
- Yes it was inconvenient,

1:05:47.488 --> 1:05:50.823
being taken from my house
like a thief in the night.

1:05:50.867 --> 1:05:54.536
I was getting ready to
have a nice hot bath.

1:05:56.165 --> 1:05:56.913
But now,

1:05:58.792 --> 1:05:59.958
I'm intrigued.

1:06:01.003 --> 1:06:02.753
What can I do for you?

1:06:02.796 --> 1:06:04.087
- You were the last
person she spoke with,

1:06:04.131 --> 1:06:05.965
according to her phone records.

1:06:06.009 --> 1:06:08.801
- Well that is tragic.

1:06:08.845 --> 1:06:12.013
- What was the nature of
your relationship with Vicky?

1:06:12.057 --> 1:06:13.514
- We were lovers.

1:06:15.351 --> 1:06:16.893
Met at the Lewis' baby shower.

1:06:16.936 --> 1:06:20.439
Been dating for a
couple of weeks.

1:06:20.483 --> 1:06:21.440
- Do you date strictly women?

1:06:21.484 --> 1:06:24.069
- I date whoever
gives me pleasure.

1:06:27.573 --> 1:06:30.742
What about you Detective Godwin?

1:06:30.786 --> 1:06:32.702
What gives you pleasure?

1:06:36.876 --> 1:06:37.666
- You,

1:06:39.044 --> 1:06:40.293
do you know if

1:06:40.337 --> 1:06:41.628
she had any plans that evening?

1:06:41.671 --> 1:06:44.799
Did she say where she was going?

1:06:44.842 --> 1:06:46.509
- She said something
about going to a club.

1:06:46.552 --> 1:06:47.510
- Did she say which one?

1:06:47.553 --> 1:06:48.803
- I wasn't interested.

1:06:48.846 --> 1:06:52.057
- Why would anybody
want to kill Vicky?

1:06:52.101 --> 1:06:53.349
- I don't know.

1:06:55.603 --> 1:06:56.394
Do you?

1:06:59.775 --> 1:07:01.191
- You live on Waverley
Crest Drive, correct?

1:07:01.235 --> 1:07:02.652
- That's correct.

1:07:04.906 --> 1:07:09.117
- That's the last address
that she put into her GPS.

1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:10.076
- Well like I said,

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:11.619
we were lovers.

1:07:11.663 --> 1:07:12.954
- Can you account for where
you were Thursday night?

1:07:12.997 --> 1:07:14.080
- I was home.

1:07:14.958 --> 1:07:17.000
You can ask my housekeeper.

1:07:17.044 --> 1:07:18.585
- I'm gonna have
to speak with her.

1:07:18.629 --> 1:07:19.586
- Of course.

1:07:21.924 --> 1:07:23.423
Look, detectives,

1:07:24.593 --> 1:07:26.468
I'm a doctor.

1:07:26.512 --> 1:07:27.469
I give life.

1:07:28.431 --> 1:07:29.556
I don't take it.

1:07:36.898 --> 1:07:39.149
There was a side to Vicky
that a lot of her friends

1:07:39.192 --> 1:07:40.651
don't know about.

1:07:42.697 --> 1:07:43.988
A dangerous side.

1:07:48.245 --> 1:07:52.204
Sounds like she just slept
with the wrong person.

1:07:57.004 --> 1:07:59.714
- [Natalie] Tell me if
this is uncomfortable.

1:07:59.757 --> 1:08:00.673
- No, it's,

1:08:00.717 --> 1:08:01.549
it's fine.

1:08:02.509 --> 1:08:04.009
- Good.

1:08:04.052 --> 1:08:05.760
You know it's sad
to know that I was

1:08:05.804 --> 1:08:08.723
one of the last
to talk to Vicky.

1:08:08.766 --> 1:08:10.641
- How do you know?

1:08:10.685 --> 1:08:12.686
- Oh, the police told me.

1:08:12.730 --> 1:08:15.147
They had some questions for me.

1:08:16.025 --> 1:08:18.859
They have no idea who did it.

1:08:18.903 --> 1:08:21.069
- Are you serious?

1:08:21.113 --> 1:08:23.113
You saw them together,

1:08:23.157 --> 1:08:24.573
in the parking lot?

1:08:26.161 --> 1:08:27.619
Natalie and Vicky,

1:08:27.662 --> 1:08:29.621
the day that Vicky died.

1:08:31.165 --> 1:08:32.373
- A bit of good news,

1:08:32.417 --> 1:08:35.793
your cervix hasn't
dilated any further.

1:08:35.837 --> 1:08:36.878
I'll give you a call
when the results

1:08:36.922 --> 1:08:38.422
of your GBS swab are in.

1:08:38.466 --> 1:08:40.007
You can get dressed.

1:08:42.511 --> 1:08:44.386
- They left together?

1:08:44.430 --> 1:08:45.679
No, I didn't know that.

1:08:45.723 --> 1:08:47.139
I didn't tell that
to the detectives.

1:08:47.183 --> 1:08:48.766
This is the first
I've heard of it.

1:08:48.809 --> 1:08:51.228
- Just switch those two around.

1:08:51.271 --> 1:08:52.938
Ms. Lewis,

1:08:52.981 --> 1:08:56.066
would you like to schedule
an appointment for next week?

1:08:56.109 --> 1:08:57.151
- Okay, thanks.

1:08:57.195 --> 1:08:58.235
Thanks, Kieth.

1:08:58.278 --> 1:08:59.110
I'll see you on
set later, thanks.

1:08:59.154 --> 1:08:59.945
Okay.

1:09:01.156 --> 1:09:02.280
Bye.

1:09:02.324 --> 1:09:05.660
(slow suspenseful music)

1:09:14.837 --> 1:09:15.711
- Look, I know that
you think that bedrest

1:09:15.755 --> 1:09:16.713
is making me crazy, okay,

1:09:16.757 --> 1:09:17.881
and it is,

1:09:17.925 --> 1:09:19.424
but I just,

1:09:19.468 --> 1:09:20.717
I don't understand when
did Natalie and Vicky

1:09:20.761 --> 1:09:22.261
become friends?

1:09:22.304 --> 1:09:23.721
You know what she
told me in that exam?

1:09:23.765 --> 1:09:25.681
She told me that the cops
questioned her last night

1:09:25.724 --> 1:09:27.015
because she was the last person

1:09:27.059 --> 1:09:28.392
to speak to Vicky.

1:09:28.435 --> 1:09:29.352
I mean come on,
that's weird, right?

1:09:29.396 --> 1:09:31.729
- I have to show you something.

1:09:38.447 --> 1:09:39.570
- What is this?

1:09:39.614 --> 1:09:40.571
Your idea of a
belated birthday gift.

1:09:40.615 --> 1:09:41.448
- No.

1:09:42.368 --> 1:09:43.575
Check it out.

1:09:43.619 --> 1:09:44.451
Please.

1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:51.167
- Cara.

1:09:56.008 --> 1:09:57.590
But that's Natalie.

1:09:59.136 --> 1:10:00.636
- I got it out of
Natalie's trash.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:01.721
- What?

1:10:01.764 --> 1:10:02.722
Why were you in Natalie's trash?

1:10:02.765 --> 1:10:05.808
- Because I don't trust her.

1:10:05.852 --> 1:10:07.226
- You know what,

1:10:08.229 --> 1:10:10.354
there's a number
on the letterhead,

1:10:10.398 --> 1:10:11.147
I'm just gonna call it.

1:10:11.190 --> 1:10:12.023
I can't do this anymore.

1:10:12.066 --> 1:10:12.690
- What are you going to say?

1:10:12.734 --> 1:10:13.692
- I don't know,

1:10:13.736 --> 1:10:15.110
but I'm just,

1:10:15.154 --> 1:10:15.527
I'm done wondering what
the heck is going on.

1:10:15.571 --> 1:10:16.111
- Okay.

1:10:17.948 --> 1:10:20.658
Put it on speaker so I can hear.

1:10:23.746 --> 1:10:26.164
- [Man On Phone] Dr.
Patterson's office.

1:10:26.207 --> 1:10:27.457
- Yes, hi.

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:29.083
May I please speak
to someone about Cara

1:10:29.127 --> 1:10:32.713
or her mother if
she's available.

1:10:32.757 --> 1:10:33.881
- [Man On Phone] May
I ask who's calling?

1:10:33.924 --> 1:10:36.632
- Just a friend from college.

1:10:36.676 --> 1:10:39.094
- [Man On Phone] Please hold.

1:10:40.931 --> 1:10:42.431
- [Doctor] This
is Dr. Patterson.

1:10:42.475 --> 1:10:44.266
Look, I don't speak
to anyone about Cara

1:10:44.310 --> 1:10:47.812
or Natalie, or whatever she's
calling herself these days.

1:10:47.856 --> 1:10:50.314
There's plenty to read
about Stockholm syndrome

1:10:50.358 --> 1:10:51.148
and Cara's abduction online,

1:10:51.192 --> 1:10:53.651
so please don't call again.

1:10:53.695 --> 1:10:54.652
- Abduction?

1:10:56.281 --> 1:10:57.072
- Damn.

1:10:58.576 --> 1:10:59.533
- Do you have your laptop?

1:10:59.577 --> 1:11:00.493
- Yeah, it's at home.

1:11:00.536 --> 1:11:01.911
- Okay, let's go.

1:11:01.954 --> 1:11:03.828
- Check please.

1:11:03.872 --> 1:11:04.622
- Come on.

1:11:09.712 --> 1:11:10.921
- [Secretary] Yes Dr. Barnson.

1:11:10.964 --> 1:11:12.923
- How long until the
Internet's back up?

1:11:12.966 --> 1:11:14.883
- [Secretary] They said
it could be a while.

1:11:14.927 --> 1:11:15.717
- What?

1:11:16.844 --> 1:11:18.428
That's ridiculous.

1:11:20.933 --> 1:11:21.890
- Whoa, wait,

1:11:21.934 --> 1:11:23.183
scroll back up.

1:11:23.227 --> 1:11:24.644
That one.

1:11:24.687 --> 1:11:26.270
Hours after giving birth,

1:11:26.314 --> 1:11:28.564
the new mother experienced
every parent's worst nightmare

1:11:28.608 --> 1:11:30.192
when her newborn baby girl

1:11:30.236 --> 1:11:32.235
was abducted from
Jefferson Hospital.

1:11:32.278 --> 1:11:33.277
- No way.

1:11:33.321 --> 1:11:34.987
- Though it's a happy ending

1:11:35.031 --> 1:11:36.532
to a terribly sad story,

1:11:36.575 --> 1:11:37.825
there's likely a long road ahead

1:11:37.868 --> 1:11:39.618
for little Cara and her parents.

1:11:39.662 --> 1:11:42.287
Wait, click on the photo.

1:11:42.331 --> 1:11:43.498
Oh my god.

1:11:43.542 --> 1:11:44.957
Look at her eyes.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.583
That's definitely Natalie.

1:11:46.627 --> 1:11:49.295
- I knew there was
something wrong with her.

1:11:49.339 --> 1:11:51.214
- Whoa, wait, stop.

1:11:51.258 --> 1:11:53.591
- That looks exactly like Matt.

1:11:56.848 --> 1:11:57.805
- Oh my god.

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:16.950
- Natalie.

1:12:18.412 --> 1:12:19.411
- Aubrey, I need to
tell you something.

1:12:19.455 --> 1:12:20.203
- What?

1:12:22.417 --> 1:12:23.624
- I think there's
something going on

1:12:23.668 --> 1:12:25.710
between Matt and Natalie.

1:12:26.670 --> 1:12:27.420
- What?

1:12:29.591 --> 1:12:31.632
- I followed Matt

1:12:31.676 --> 1:12:33.134
to Natalie's house.

1:12:34.346 --> 1:12:35.596
I think they're
having an affair.

1:12:35.639 --> 1:12:36.597
- What?

1:12:37.641 --> 1:12:38.682
- Natalie, hey.

1:12:43.355 --> 1:12:44.563
- Hi.

1:12:44.607 --> 1:12:46.733
- What the hell are you up to?

1:12:46.776 --> 1:12:47.734
- What are you talking about?

1:12:47.777 --> 1:12:48.902
- One of my crew guys saw you

1:12:48.945 --> 1:12:50.862
at the studio,

1:12:50.906 --> 1:12:52.238
in the parking lot
talking to Vicky

1:12:52.282 --> 1:12:54.032
the same day she was murdered.

1:12:54.075 --> 1:12:55.575
Jesus.

1:12:55.619 --> 1:12:56.618
- How.

1:12:57.704 --> 1:12:58.786
Oh my god Janelle.

1:12:58.830 --> 1:13:00.789
How long have you
known about this?

1:13:00.833 --> 1:13:02.291
- I don't, I mean--
- Oh my god.

1:13:02.335 --> 1:13:03.292
- Listen.

1:13:03.336 --> 1:13:04.210
- So what, I was
looking for you,

1:13:04.253 --> 1:13:05.044
I bumped into Vicky.

1:13:05.087 --> 1:13:06.588
Where's the crime in that?

1:13:06.632 --> 1:13:08.547
- Oh, come on.

1:13:08.591 --> 1:13:09.882
Did you have something to
do with Vicky's murder?

1:13:09.926 --> 1:13:10.591
I wouldn't put it past you.

1:13:10.635 --> 1:13:12.260
You are crazy.

1:13:12.304 --> 1:13:13.386
- Oh my god.
- I don't know for sure,

1:13:13.430 --> 1:13:14.513
but I wasn't going to tell you

1:13:14.556 --> 1:13:15.597
unless I knew for.

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:16.723
- Oh my god, I'm such an idiot.

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:17.474
- And I feel like,
you're not an idiot.

1:13:17.518 --> 1:13:18.726
He is the idiot.

1:13:18.770 --> 1:13:19.560
Nat is the idiot.

1:13:19.604 --> 1:13:20.770
- Oh god.

1:13:20.813 --> 1:13:23.396
- What happened, what's wrong?

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:24.231
What's happening?

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:25.107
- Oh god.

1:13:25.151 --> 1:13:25.900
I think my water broke.

1:13:25.944 --> 1:13:26.651
- I'm gonna call Nat.

1:13:26.694 --> 1:13:28.027
- Call 911.

1:13:28.071 --> 1:13:29.320
- Okay, okay.

1:13:29.364 --> 1:13:30.071
I'm going to.

1:13:30.114 --> 1:13:30.989
- You are insane.

1:13:31.033 --> 1:13:31.698
I would not put that past you,

1:13:31.742 --> 1:13:32.824
this whole thing.

1:13:32.868 --> 1:13:33.617
- I think you're,

1:13:33.661 --> 1:13:34.618
- This is all your,

1:13:34.662 --> 1:13:35.451
you're just so crazy.

1:13:35.495 --> 1:13:36.202
- Just a little tired.

1:13:36.246 --> 1:13:37.036
- Ah.

1:13:39.625 --> 1:13:42.501
(dramatic music)

1:13:46.299 --> 1:13:47.090
- Oh Matt.

1:13:49.928 --> 1:13:51.636
What have you done?

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:53.638
What have you done to us?

1:13:57.687 --> 1:14:00.062
(phone rings)

1:14:04.944 --> 1:14:06.610
Matt Lewis' office.

1:14:08.614 --> 1:14:09.739
Oh, hi Janelle.

1:14:09.783 --> 1:14:11.658
This is Matt's assistant.

1:14:11.702 --> 1:14:12.576
He's on set right now,

1:14:12.619 --> 1:14:13.410
can I

1:14:13.453 --> 1:14:14.578
take a message?

1:14:14.621 --> 1:14:15.621
Oh really.

1:14:17.791 --> 1:14:19.291
That's wonderful.

1:14:20.711 --> 1:14:23.629
Yes, I will be sure to tell him.

1:14:23.673 --> 1:14:24.755
Okay, thanks.

1:14:27.844 --> 1:14:28.844
Your wife's having your baby.

1:14:28.887 --> 1:14:32.388
(slow suspenseful music)

1:14:43.403 --> 1:14:44.610
- Hello Ms. Lewis.

1:14:45.654 --> 1:14:47.029
I'm nurse Harrison.

1:14:47.072 --> 1:14:48.197
I just spoke with Dr. Flickman

1:14:48.241 --> 1:14:49.073
and he's on his way.

1:14:49.117 --> 1:14:49.866
- Oh, thank you.

1:14:49.909 --> 1:14:50.825
Thank you so much,

1:14:50.869 --> 1:14:52.619
you just can't know.

1:14:54.206 --> 1:14:55.581
- [Nurse] That'll be you soon.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:56.999
- Oh.

1:14:57.084 --> 1:15:00.502
(slow suspenseful music)

1:15:16.063 --> 1:15:16.811
- Natalie?

1:15:16.855 --> 1:15:17.646
Natalie?

1:15:26.741 --> 1:15:27.615
- Ah, Dr. Flickman.

1:15:27.659 --> 1:15:28.824
I never should have left you.

1:15:28.868 --> 1:15:29.742
- And how are you doing?

1:15:29.786 --> 1:15:31.035
- I'm scared.

1:15:31.079 --> 1:15:32.871
- Well you should be.

1:15:32.915 --> 1:15:34.831
You're about to have a baby.

1:15:34.875 --> 1:15:37.000
Let's get you checked out.

1:15:41.340 --> 1:15:42.255
- Hey.

1:15:42.299 --> 1:15:44.007
Sorry, how is she doing?

1:15:44.051 --> 1:15:44.842
Like really.

1:15:44.886 --> 1:15:45.677
- Your sister's fine.

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:46.969
She's doing great.

1:15:47.013 --> 1:15:47.720
We'll check back on
her in a few minutes.

1:15:47.764 --> 1:15:48.805
- Okay, thanks.

1:15:48.848 --> 1:15:51.058
(dinging)

1:15:56.898 --> 1:15:59.608
(dramatic music)

1:16:16.754 --> 1:16:18.003
- Natalie?

1:16:18.047 --> 1:16:20.673
(dramatic music)

1:16:24.846 --> 1:16:25.761
Natalie.

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:32.227
(dramatic music)

1:16:56.213 --> 1:16:57.004
Jesus.

1:17:06.974 --> 1:17:07.807
Oh my god.

1:17:27.790 --> 1:17:28.538
- You are such a jerk Matt.

1:17:28.582 --> 1:17:29.915
You just disgust me.

1:17:29.958 --> 1:17:31.999
Who do you think you are?

1:17:33.879 --> 1:17:34.795
What are you doing here?

1:17:34.838 --> 1:17:35.754
What are you--

1:17:39.719 --> 1:17:41.302
- You talk too much.

1:17:44.807 --> 1:17:46.015
- We're at eight centimeters.

1:17:46.059 --> 1:17:47.809
Baby looks good.

1:17:47.852 --> 1:17:50.269
Of course it's too
late to do an epidural.

1:17:50.313 --> 1:17:52.689
So I'm gonna need you
to be tough, okay.

1:17:52.733 --> 1:17:54.066
Deep breaths.

1:17:54.109 --> 1:17:55.859
- Okay, thanks doctor.

1:18:01.784 --> 1:18:02.616
Oh baby.

1:18:03.786 --> 1:18:07.247
(slow suspenseful music)

1:18:34.820 --> 1:18:36.612
- Dr. Barnson.

1:18:36.656 --> 1:18:38.823
It's been a while.

1:18:38.867 --> 1:18:41.950
Your patient said
you were unavailable.

1:18:41.994 --> 1:18:45.746
(slow suspenseful music)

1:18:45.790 --> 1:18:49.668
- Nobody ever makes a move
on one of my patients.

1:18:52.381 --> 1:18:53.130
- Oh god.

1:18:54.424 --> 1:18:55.716
Ah.

1:18:55.759 --> 1:18:56.800
- Mrs. Lewis,

1:18:58.095 --> 1:18:58.969
how are you feeling hon?

1:18:59.013 --> 1:19:00.762
- Where is Dr. Flickman?

1:19:00.806 --> 1:19:01.805
- You know what,

1:19:01.850 --> 1:19:02.724
I'm gonna need you to stay calm.

1:19:02.767 --> 1:19:04.517
I'm gonna check a few things.

1:19:04.561 --> 1:19:06.144
Deep breaths.

1:19:06.187 --> 1:19:07.729
Focus on deep breaths.

1:19:07.772 --> 1:19:09.606
You got this.

1:19:09.649 --> 1:19:10.732
He's on his way.

1:19:10.775 --> 1:19:14.193
(slow suspenseful music)

1:19:39.681 --> 1:19:42.642
(suspenseful music)

1:19:46.690 --> 1:19:48.774
- Where is Dr. Flickman?

1:19:49.859 --> 1:19:50.900
- Don't worry,

1:19:50.944 --> 1:19:51.609
the doctor's gonna
be here shortly,

1:19:51.653 --> 1:19:52.526
okay.

1:19:52.570 --> 1:19:53.445
Now with each contraction,

1:19:53.489 --> 1:19:54.738
I need you to take a deep breath

1:19:54.782 --> 1:19:55.572
and push,

1:19:55.616 --> 1:19:56.365
are you ready?

1:19:56.408 --> 1:19:58.075
Alright deep breath,

1:19:58.118 --> 1:19:59.285
and push.

1:19:59.329 --> 1:20:00.119
One.

1:20:00.163 --> 1:20:03.247
(screaming)

1:20:03.291 --> 1:20:04.164
You got this.

1:20:04.208 --> 1:20:04.915
That is great.

1:20:04.959 --> 1:20:05.959
The head is coming down,

1:20:06.002 --> 1:20:07.001
just a few more pushes.

1:20:07.045 --> 1:20:07.835
Here we go.

1:20:07.879 --> 1:20:09.420
And push.

1:20:09.464 --> 1:20:10.380
Yes, one,

1:20:10.423 --> 1:20:11.214
two,

1:20:11.257 --> 1:20:12.049
three.

1:20:12.093 --> 1:20:13.676
Thank goodness doctor,

1:20:13.719 --> 1:20:15.469
you're just in time.

1:20:20.935 --> 1:20:23.602
- I see you're doing great.

1:20:23.646 --> 1:20:25.689
- She cannot deliver my baby.

1:20:25.732 --> 1:20:26.564
- Mrs. Lewis,

1:20:26.608 --> 1:20:27.315
I need you to calm down.

1:20:27.401 --> 1:20:28.149
- I cannot,

1:20:28.193 --> 1:20:28.858
I will not stay calm.

1:20:28.902 --> 1:20:29.693
Please,

1:20:29.736 --> 1:20:30.735
please just

1:20:30.779 --> 1:20:31.486
find my sister or my husband.

1:20:31.530 --> 1:20:32.946
Help me.

1:20:32.990 --> 1:20:34.406
- Nurse, would you
please administer

1:20:34.449 --> 1:20:35.991
a dose of Versed and Fentanyl.

1:20:36.034 --> 1:20:37.618
- Help me.

1:20:37.662 --> 1:20:38.703
- Do it.

1:20:38.746 --> 1:20:39.620
- Help me please, help me.

1:20:39.664 --> 1:20:40.496
- Now.

1:20:42.375 --> 1:20:43.582
Mrs. Lewis,

1:20:43.626 --> 1:20:44.876
you are too far along to stop.

1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:46.460
- You won't take my baby.

1:20:46.504 --> 1:20:47.795
- Now you are going
to have this baby

1:20:47.839 --> 1:20:49.630
whether you like it or not.

1:20:49.674 --> 1:20:50.632
- Doctor.

1:20:50.676 --> 1:20:52.217
Doctor, no.

1:20:52.261 --> 1:20:54.636
(screaming)

1:21:03.565 --> 1:21:04.230
- Help me.

1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:06.149
Help.

1:21:08.695 --> 1:21:10.154
No, no.

1:21:10.197 --> 1:21:10.988
Help.

1:21:11.032 --> 1:21:11.780
- Shhh.

1:21:14.534 --> 1:21:15.324
Relax.

1:21:16.912 --> 1:21:17.703
Relax.

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:28.798
Now, I'm telling
you one last time,

1:21:30.510 --> 1:21:31.718
as your doctor,

1:21:35.641 --> 1:21:36.432
push.

1:21:47.905 --> 1:21:49.071
- [Aubrey] No.

1:21:49.114 --> 1:21:50.197
- Alright, push.

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:52.324
(screaming)

1:21:52.367 --> 1:21:55.035
(dramatic music)

1:22:04.672 --> 1:22:07.382
(screaming)

1:22:07.426 --> 1:22:08.382
- Yes, okay.

1:22:09.636 --> 1:22:10.802
Oh my god.

1:22:10.845 --> 1:22:13.430
(baby crying)

1:22:22.733 --> 1:22:25.442
(dramatic music)

1:22:37.499 --> 1:22:39.416
By the way, it's a girl,

1:22:42.588 --> 1:22:43.921
and she's perfect.

1:22:46.885 --> 1:22:47.676
- Excuse me,

1:22:47.719 --> 1:22:50.052
I need Aubrey Lewis' room.

1:22:50.096 --> 1:22:51.847
It's an emergency.

1:22:51.890 --> 1:22:52.931
I think it's labor.

1:22:53.016 --> 1:22:53.765
Hey,

1:22:54.685 --> 1:22:55.809
hey.

1:22:55.853 --> 1:22:56.643
- Get out of here.

1:22:56.687 --> 1:22:57.770
Get away from me.

1:22:57.814 --> 1:22:59.689
How could you?

1:22:59.732 --> 1:23:00.523
- I'm sorry.

1:23:00.567 --> 1:23:01.399
I'm sorry, okay.

1:23:01.442 --> 1:23:02.233
- She's here.

1:23:02.318 --> 1:23:03.067
- Who?

1:23:03.111 --> 1:23:04.694
- Natalie is here.

1:23:04.737 --> 1:23:05.695
She's here.

1:23:05.738 --> 1:23:06.571
Go.

1:23:06.614 --> 1:23:07.321
- Where's Aubrey?

1:23:07.365 --> 1:23:08.156
What room?

1:23:08.199 --> 1:23:09.532
- It's 123, go.

1:23:09.576 --> 1:23:12.786
(slow suspenseful music)

1:23:36.063 --> 1:23:36.854
- Aubrey.

1:23:39.192 --> 1:23:40.649
What happened?

1:23:40.693 --> 1:23:41.650
Are you okay?

1:23:41.694 --> 1:23:43.153
- She has

1:23:43.197 --> 1:23:43.945
our baby.

1:23:45.656 --> 1:23:47.364
Natalie took our baby.

1:23:48.452 --> 1:23:49.993
Bring back our baby.

1:23:51.747 --> 1:23:52.954
- Someone help.

1:23:52.998 --> 1:23:54.372
Help in here.

1:23:54.416 --> 1:23:56.125
Get over here.

1:23:56.169 --> 1:23:57.418
You know Dr. Barnson?

1:23:57.462 --> 1:23:59.211
Dr. Barnson?

1:23:59.254 --> 1:24:00.712
She took our baby.

1:24:00.756 --> 1:24:01.881
Call security.

1:24:01.925 --> 1:24:02.715
I'll get her back.

1:24:02.759 --> 1:24:04.717
I'll get her back, okay.

It's just a little way down.

Natalie.

No, stop right there.

Stop.

1:25:41.991 --> 1:25:42.865
Hey, hey, hey.

1:25:42.908 --> 1:25:44.284
No, no, no.

1:25:44.328 --> 1:25:45.118
Just,

1:25:45.162 --> 1:25:46.077
just wait.

1:25:46.121 --> 1:25:47.787
Wait.

1:25:47.831 --> 1:25:49.707
Aubrey's dead.

1:25:49.751 --> 1:25:51.124
She didn't make it.

1:25:54.963 --> 1:25:56.589
- I don't believe you.

1:25:56.632 --> 1:25:57.381
- No, it's true.

1:25:57.425 --> 1:25:59.592
It's true, I swear.

1:25:59.635 --> 1:26:01.677
She's not strong like you are.

1:26:01.721 --> 1:26:03.388
She was never meant
to be a mother

1:26:03.432 --> 1:26:04.889
like you are.

1:26:04.932 --> 1:26:06.223
She's not.

1:26:06.267 --> 1:26:08.100
- And what about you?

1:26:08.144 --> 1:26:09.394
What about you?

1:26:09.438 --> 1:26:10.937
You didn't even want
this beautiful baby.

1:26:10.981 --> 1:26:12.147
- No, I didn't
know what I wanted.

1:26:12.191 --> 1:26:13.357
- You didn't even want her.

1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:15.234
- I didn't know.

1:26:15.278 --> 1:26:16.694
I don't know what it
means to be a father,

1:26:16.738 --> 1:26:18.028
but you showed me that.

1:26:18.072 --> 1:26:19.613
You showed me what it
means to be a father.

1:26:19.656 --> 1:26:20.739
You did.

1:26:20.783 --> 1:26:22.784
Please, please, please.

1:26:23.745 --> 1:26:24.660
- Get back.

1:26:24.704 --> 1:26:25.536
Get back.

1:26:27.917 --> 1:26:30.376
(baby cries)

1:26:34.048 --> 1:26:35.798
- When I was at your house,

1:26:35.841 --> 1:26:36.840
I saw your nursery.

1:26:36.884 --> 1:26:37.674
It's beautiful.

1:26:37.718 --> 1:26:38.759
It's perfect.

1:26:40.012 --> 1:26:41.805
It's perfect for her.

1:26:43.308 --> 1:26:44.015
But you can't be a mother

1:26:44.059 --> 1:26:44.974
all alone.

1:26:45.018 --> 1:26:46.475
I can't be a father all alone.

1:26:46.519 --> 1:26:47.894
We can do this together,

1:26:47.938 --> 1:26:49.479
you and I,

1:26:49.523 --> 1:26:50.605
like a family,

1:26:50.649 --> 1:26:52.190
a real family.

1:26:52.234 --> 1:26:53.401
- [Dad] Natalie.

1:26:53.444 --> 1:26:54.276
I love you.

1:26:57.490 --> 1:27:00.157
(police chatter)

1:27:05.833 --> 1:27:07.707
- Let me hold her.

1:27:07.751 --> 1:27:08.542
Okay, just,

1:27:09.545 --> 1:27:11.711
I just want to hold her.

1:27:11.755 --> 1:27:12.588
Okay.

1:27:17.261 --> 1:27:19.512
- [Man] He's got a gun.

1:27:19.556 --> 1:27:21.472
- You took my family.

1:27:21.516 --> 1:27:22.723
We were a family.

1:27:23.768 --> 1:27:25.352
- [Man] Jimmy put the gun down.

1:27:25.396 --> 1:27:28.062
- You've destroyed that.

1:27:28.106 --> 1:27:31.483
All I wanted was for
us to be left alone.

1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:37.614
Bye princess.

1:27:37.659 --> 1:27:38.741
- Daddy!

1:27:38.785 --> 1:27:40.994
(screams)

1:27:57.013 --> 1:27:58.345
- Hey princess.

1:27:59.932 --> 1:28:00.806
I love you.

1:28:05.814 --> 1:28:07.689
- I love you too daddy.

1:28:10.319 --> 1:28:11.067
(screams)

1:28:11.111 --> 1:28:13.737
(dramatic music)

1:28:32.718 --> 1:28:33.675
- It's okay.

1:28:36.764 --> 1:28:39.515
I'll get you to your momma.

1:28:39.558 --> 1:28:42.227
(dramatic music)

1:29:07.756 --> 1:29:08.755
- Hi.

1:29:08.799 --> 1:29:09.673
- She's fine.

1:29:11.635 --> 1:29:12.551
She's safe.

1:29:13.763 --> 1:29:14.762
- Thank you.

1:29:14.806 --> 1:29:15.805
- Careful.

1:29:17.976 --> 1:29:19.684
- Oh, she's beautiful.

1:29:25.483 --> 1:29:26.984
You're so beautiful.

1:29:29.113 --> 1:29:29.861
Hi.

1:29:33.951 --> 1:29:34.700
Hi.

1:29:40.375 --> 1:29:41.916
You're so beautiful.

1:29:52.013 --> 1:29:54.805
- Gonna miss you you
little snuggle bug.

1:29:54.849 --> 1:29:56.682
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1:29:56.726 --> 1:29:57.892
Up.

1:29:57.936 --> 1:30:00.686
Watch, there we go, there we go.

1:30:02.648 --> 1:30:03.772
Hi.

1:30:03.816 --> 1:30:04.899
- Hi.

1:30:04.943 --> 1:30:06.526
- Here she is.

1:30:06.570 --> 1:30:08.445
The most beautiful
girl in the world.

1:30:08.488 --> 1:30:10.196
Second most beautiful.

1:30:13.369 --> 1:30:14.951
Hey, I was thinking that maybe

1:30:14.995 --> 1:30:15.785
next time

1:30:15.829 --> 1:30:16.786
I might come

1:30:16.830 --> 1:30:17.872
for a visit,

1:30:17.915 --> 1:30:18.956
maybe we could,

1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:20.791
I don't know, you know,

1:30:22.837 --> 1:30:23.712
have dinner

1:30:24.840 --> 1:30:26.465
together as a family?

1:30:29.427 --> 1:30:30.177
- Yeah, I don't know.

1:30:30.220 --> 1:30:32.262
I don't know either Matt.

1:30:32.306 --> 1:30:33.055
- Okay.

1:30:36.019 --> 1:30:36.809
- Maybe.

1:30:39.481 --> 1:30:40.730
Maybe.

1:30:40.774 --> 1:30:43.232
(somber music)

1:31:26.906 --> 1:31:29.366
(soft music)
