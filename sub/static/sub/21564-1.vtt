- "Eyes like mirrors, pristine,

00:20.107 --> 00:22.848
"reflecting the reflection.

00:22.892 --> 00:26.026
"An endless game
of self-deception.

Not just without, but within."
I'm trying to read, Ma!

00:40.823 --> 00:44.609
- Where's my insulin?
- It's in the refrigerator!

00:46.524 --> 00:48.874
- I'm looking in the damn
refrigerator!

00:48.918 --> 00:51.268
- I'm coming, Ma.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.923
Sarah Miles...

00:53.966 --> 00:58.058
I swear you're the only thing
that keeps me sane.

01:02.018 --> 01:06.283
Megan, sweetie, do you want milk or juice in your lunch?

01:06.327 --> 01:09.460
- I don't care.
- Juice it is, then.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.074
Oh!

01:14.117 --> 01:17.816
Look at that. Mommy's new poem
just got another like.

01:17.860 --> 01:21.907
-: Sarah!
- I don't wanna go to school.

01:21.951 --> 01:25.302
- Sweetheart.
- I wanna stay with you.

01:25.346 --> 01:29.176
- Sarah, did you see my phone?
- You left it by the bed.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.613
- I know where I left it. What
I wanna know is where it is now.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.006
I gotta go, I have a meeting
in an hour and I can't be late.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.705
- Megan, honey, do you
have your daddy's phone?

01:36.748 --> 01:39.142
- I was playing
Friendly Fish on it.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.975
- Sweetheart, Daddy's
gonna give you your own phone

01:46.018 --> 01:50.501
so you can play Friendly Fish
anytime you want. Hmm?

01:54.897 --> 01:57.943
- Honey, why don't we
make a little deal?

01:57.987 --> 02:00.859
You put a smile
on your face for school,

02:00.903 --> 02:03.775
and when I come pick you up we
can do something extra special.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.342
- Like what?

02:05.386 --> 02:08.911
- Well, we could go skiing on
the other side of the mountain.

02:08.954 --> 02:12.001
- Can Daddy come?
- Oh, sweetheart,

02:12.044 --> 02:14.656
I'd love to, but Daddy's
gonna be working late tonight.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.136
- Again?

02:17.920 --> 02:20.575
- Betting on a new high-rise.
Client likes to be entertained.

02:23.578 --> 02:26.015
- Ma? I got you a new book.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.931
- Just put it over there
with the rest of them.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.847
- You should actually read
this one. It's about...

02:31.890 --> 02:34.806
- Bah, I don't care
what it's about.

02:34.850 --> 02:38.114
You spend too much time
in them books.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.682
That's why you don't have any friends.
- I have friends.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.553
- Who, the BronteÃ« sisters?

02:42.597 --> 02:45.121
What's that one
you keep talking about?

02:45.165 --> 02:49.212
Writes all those stupid poems.
- Sarah Miles.

02:49.256 --> 02:53.216
And they're not stupid.
- Hm! Gimme a break.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.524
Total waste of time.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.526
What you need to do

02:58.569 --> 03:01.224
is get out there
and find yourself a man.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.575
- Yeah, worked out great for you.
- What d'you say?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.926
- Nothing, Ma.

03:07.970 --> 03:11.191
- Yeah. Well, stop your mumbling
and bring me my dinner.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.977
- Yes, Ma.
- Hm.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.552
- What are you still doing up?

03:24.595 --> 03:27.381
- Who is she this time?

03:28.904 --> 03:31.559
You're not gonna say anything?

03:31.602 --> 03:34.823
- What do you want me to say?

03:36.607 --> 03:40.698
- Yeah. I guess
there's nothing to say.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.237
I can't
do this anymore.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.066
- Do what? What can't you do?

04:01.110 --> 04:03.547
- This. Us.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.681
- You really have it
tough here, huh?

04:06.724 --> 04:10.119
- I'm not talking
about the house,

04:10.162 --> 04:11.903
or the money.

04:11.947 --> 04:16.255
I'm talking about our marriage.
- I've had a long day.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.129
- Daniel, I'm leaving.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.524
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm serious.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.704
I don't know what else to do.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.621
- You go, you go with nothing.

04:33.664 --> 04:37.581
- I told you I don't care about the money.
- You go without Megan too.

04:39.191 --> 04:42.717
- I'm her mother.
- Doesn't matter.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.197
No one takes anything from me.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.374
- She's not a thing.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.941
She's our daughter.
- You know

04:49.985 --> 04:54.206
what I do, Sarah,
and you know how I do it.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.297
I don't lose, ever.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.125
- Daniel--

05:00.169 --> 05:03.390
- You try and take away
my daughter,

05:03.433 --> 05:06.175
she'll grow up
without a mother.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.052
Get out.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.239
- Lee!

05:40.252 --> 05:44.605
- What happened?
- Looks like I fell.

05:44.648 --> 05:48.217
Help me up.
- What are you doing out here in the middle of the night, Mom?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.393
- I need sugar.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.265
- You're supposed to keep something to eat next to your bed.

05:53.309 --> 05:57.095
- I don't need a damn lecture.
Help me up, dammit!

05:58.662 --> 06:03.232
- What would you do if I weren't here?
- Where the hell else

06:03.275 --> 06:05.408
would you be?

06:05.452 --> 06:07.758
Don't stand there
like an idiot.

06:11.109 --> 06:14.286
- I don't appreciate the way
you're speaking to me.

06:14.330 --> 06:18.813
- Oh, you ungrateful little bitch.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be out on the street.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.163
- If it wasn't for you,
I'd have a life, Mom!

06:21.206 --> 06:24.775
- Poor little Lee, oh!
Daddy's little girl--

06:24.819 --> 06:27.212
- Don't! Don't call me that!

06:27.256 --> 06:31.565
Lee! Get out here right now!

06:31.608 --> 06:35.177
- Stop your whining
and help me up!

06:40.182 --> 06:43.098
- Help yourself.

06:45.709 --> 06:49.321
- Where the hell you going, Lee?

06:55.545 --> 06:58.722
Help... me...

07:20.527 --> 07:23.921
- We're all set.
I'll see you at 3.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.949
- Shoulda been nicer to me.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.977
- Girl, I do not see
what you see in that woman.

08:20.021 --> 08:23.807
- Are you kidding?
Sarah Miles is a genius.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.508
- "Soft summer solace,

08:28.551 --> 08:30.988
drowning in an empty pool."

08:31.032 --> 08:34.251
She's so obvious.
- You have no clue.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.951
- There's a reason she was
published only once.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.475
- She has a blog now.
- Ooh, a blog!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.173
I bet I have more followers
on my Instagram.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.742
- Many brilliant female poets
died before they became famous.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.136
Look at Emily Dickinson
or Sylvia Plath--

08:48.179 --> 08:50.965
- Well, unless she gets hit
by a bus, I'm pretty sure

08:51.008 --> 08:54.490
the poetry of Sarah Miles
is doomed to obscurity.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.757
Hey, Daniel.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.285
- Tonight? How late?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.943
- I get it. It's business.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.816
Yeah.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.391
Hi, Mr. Nelson, it's Lee.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.480
I have an idea how we can

09:28.524 --> 09:30.787
bring in more customers,
you know, people who love books.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.747
I was thinking we could have authors come in

09:33.790 --> 09:36.097
and read their works,
do book signings.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.621
Actually, yes,

09:38.665 --> 09:41.493
I do have someone in mind.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.445
- Hello?
- Hi, Sarah. It's Will Lawrence calling.

10:20.489 --> 10:23.057
- I saw the caller ID, but
I thought it must be a mistake.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.278
- It has been a long time.
How you doing?

10:27.322 --> 10:29.672
I'm well.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.849
I'm calling is because
we have an offer for you.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.635
Really?

10:35.678 --> 10:39.116
A reading?

10:39.160 --> 10:41.815
After all this time?

10:41.858 --> 10:44.252
It's at an independent bookstore

10:46.776 --> 10:51.215
or anything,
but the woman did seem very passionate about the idea,

10:54.523 --> 10:57.961
Thank you.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.181
Lee Maxson.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.982
- Oh, my God. She's really here.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.726
- Thank you.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.511
Hi. Uh, I'm Sarah Miles.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.863
- Lee.
- I should've called first but--

11:29.906 --> 11:32.256
- No! No, no, no. That's OK.
I'm just so glad that you came.

11:33.867 --> 11:39.611
Um, can we get you anything, or do you want to take a seat?
- Sure.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.053
I didn't know that there were
still bookstores like this.

11:46.096 --> 11:49.926
- Oh, yeah. We're small,
but we're really dedicated.

11:49.970 --> 11:53.016
- So...

11:53.060 --> 11:56.759
do you really think that anyone's gonna be interested to hear me read?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.501
- Of course.
Of course they are.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.722
Your work really
speaks to people.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.420
- Thank you, that's...

12:05.463 --> 12:08.684
that's really sweet
of you to say.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.687
- Um, so we were hoping

12:11.731 --> 12:15.038
that you could come by
as soon as Saturday,

12:15.082 --> 12:17.171
if that's OK with you.

12:17.214 --> 12:21.566
- Uh, I just have to figure out
which pieces to read.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.960
- If I may...

12:24.004 --> 12:27.964
I think it would be so great if
you did a mix of Silent Echoes

12:28.008 --> 12:30.227
with some
of the poems

12:30.271 --> 12:33.709
from your blog. Vacant Lot
is my absolute favorite.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.060
- Really? - Yeah.
- That's my favorite too.

12:37.104 --> 12:40.760
- Oh! So,
could we say 7 p.m.?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.587
- Yeah, sure,

12:42.631 --> 12:44.938
why not?
- OK.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.862
See, Mom,

12:55.905 --> 12:58.212
I have a friend now.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.431
A real friend.

13:23.977 --> 13:27.110
- Look, Daddy.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.112
- Ho, ho!

13:29.156 --> 13:31.288
It's beautiful, honey.

13:31.332 --> 13:34.814
I'm gonna frame it
and hang it in my office.

13:34.857 --> 13:38.600
- Daniel, do you think you could watch
Megan for a couple hours tomorrow,

13:38.643 --> 13:42.212
or should I ask Nina?
- I can't think of anything I'd rather do.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.692
We got a date?
- Yeah.

13:45.737 --> 13:50.830
- What are you gonna be doing?
- Oh, I just have a couple of errands to run.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.226
- Good job.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.840
- "No more my savior,

14:00.883 --> 14:03.016
"no more your slave.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.714
"Forever a prisoner.

14:05.757 --> 14:09.152
My freedom, your grave."

14:09.196 --> 14:13.417
Thank you.

14:17.073 --> 14:20.250
- Bye, Lee. Thanks.
- Thank you. - See you later.

14:27.562 --> 14:31.783
- That was amazing.
- Yeah, I think it went OK.

14:31.827 --> 14:35.309
- OK? Hearing those poems
in your words,

14:35.352 --> 14:38.138
with your heart was... profound.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.096
Thank you.

14:40.140 --> 14:44.100
- That last piece,
the newer one...

14:44.144 --> 14:46.798
I've never heard someone

14:46.842 --> 14:48.844
capture
the desperation

14:48.888 --> 14:52.108
of an abusive relationship
so perfectly.

14:52.152 --> 14:56.025
- What makes you think
it's about that?

14:56.069 --> 14:59.333
- My father.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.639
He was like that.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.641
Cold and...

15:03.685 --> 15:06.122
controlling.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.646
All he...

15:08.690 --> 15:11.649
all he could do was hurt.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.740
- I'm sorry.

15:15.784 --> 15:19.962
- What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.617
Is the piece
about your father?

15:22.660 --> 15:26.534
- I actually never knew
my father. Or my mother.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.754
Um, I was raised
in foster care.

15:29.798 --> 15:33.671
- Oh. Then...

15:33.715 --> 15:35.717
your husband?

15:39.025 --> 15:43.377
- I actually promised Daniel
that I would be home for dinner,

15:43.420 --> 15:46.510
so I should...
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.860
- No, no, no. No, it's OK.

15:48.904 --> 15:53.343
I'm just really not used
to sharing my work like this.

15:53.387 --> 15:58.000
- You know, I also write
a poetry newsletter.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.741
It's no big deal,

15:59.784 --> 16:02.135
but I would love to interview
you if you had time.

16:04.180 --> 16:07.227
- Let me think about it.
- Yeah.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.622
Thank you again. Bye.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.590
- I'm home.
- Mommy!

16:25.332 --> 16:28.465
- Hi, sweetie.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.598
- Mr. Maxson said something
came up at work

16:30.641 --> 16:33.731
and he wouldn't
make it home for dinner.

16:33.775 --> 16:37.431
- OK. Thanks, Nina.

17:06.763 --> 17:10.464
I was so caught up
in our perfect life

17:10.507 --> 17:13.554
that I didn't see
what was happening.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.905
I've lost touch
with family and friends...

17:16.948 --> 17:20.473
Everything that I do,
everything that I am

17:20.517 --> 17:22.693
revolves around Daniel.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.957
- Has he ever been violent
with you or your daughter?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.438
- Violent, no, but...

17:28.482 --> 17:30.440
he did threaten me.

17:30.484 --> 17:34.531
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- He works

17:34.575 --> 17:37.969
in construction,
so he has connections.

17:38.013 --> 17:41.103
And if he knew
that I was even here--

17:41.147 --> 17:45.151
- I assure you that
we will be quite discreet.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.154
- I don't want his money.

17:48.197 --> 17:52.375
I just want to be able to take
my daughter far away from him.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.117
- Assuming you're right
about his infidelity,

17:55.161 --> 17:59.252
once we gather evidence,
you will have your divorce.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.558
But...

18:01.602 --> 18:03.647
with your husband's resources,

18:03.691 --> 18:06.215
you're likely gonna be
looking at shared custody.

18:08.913 --> 18:12.134
Do you still wanna
move forward?

18:12.178 --> 18:15.529
- I do.

18:17.313 --> 18:20.186
- I'm seeing Sarah later today.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.362
You would've loved her, Mom.

18:22.405 --> 18:26.105
She's so smart and
beautiful and kind.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.933
It's like we're soulmates.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
- You have exquisite taste.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.031
- And many things.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.382
- Your wife is a lucky woman.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.775
- Who said they were for her?

19:07.015 --> 19:11.062
- Yeah, it's me.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.848
I think someone's following me.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.111
Downtown.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.680
You need to find out what this is about.
- OK, I'll put someone on it.

19:19.723 --> 19:23.945
- Well, when Silent Echoeswas published,
it actually did really well.

19:23.988 --> 19:28.167
You know, for poetry.
Um, I was invited

19:28.210 --> 19:31.518
to do readings across the country and,
you know, I was pregnant with Megan,

19:31.561 --> 19:34.042
but it was early
so I really wanted to go.

19:34.085 --> 19:37.001
Anyway, Daniel

19:37.045 --> 19:41.397
- that's my husband-
sort of talked me out of it.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.226
And after that,

19:44.270 --> 19:46.228
things kind of cooled off.

19:46.272 --> 19:50.319
I wasn't writing as much
and my publisher lost interest.

19:50.363 --> 19:54.149
- And what about your blog?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.239
- It's been my lifeline.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.895
I'm totally amazed
at how much support

20:00.938 --> 20:03.593
I've gotten from my fans
over the past couple of years.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.857
- That's because
your work is amazing.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.859
- Thank you.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.777
You know, Lee, until I met you,

20:13.821 --> 20:18.086
I didn't realize how
isolated I've become.

20:21.132 --> 20:24.223
- I hope you don't mind me
saying, but...

20:24.266 --> 20:28.009
being married should never
leave you feeling alone.

20:30.098 --> 20:33.797
I... anyway, um...

20:33.841 --> 20:37.061
I was actually
an English major too.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.978
I had this big dream
of moving to New York.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.678
- As a writer?
- Oh God, no. No, I could never.

20:46.201 --> 20:50.031
I... I wanted to work in publishing.
- What stopped you?

20:50.074 --> 20:53.904
- My... father died.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.561
He killed himself, actually.

21:08.702 --> 21:13.446
And my mom, uh...

21:14.969 --> 21:18.146
I just couldn't leave her alone.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.149
- You said that your mother
passed recently?

21:23.238 --> 21:26.154
Maybe now is the time
to follow your dreams.

21:26.197 --> 21:30.550
- Hey, uh...
there's this library down the street and they're having

21:30.593 --> 21:32.769
their monthly book sale.
I was gonna go check it out.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.119
Would you want to come with?

21:35.163 --> 21:38.906
- I've got some time.
Yeah, sure, why not?

21:38.949 --> 21:42.170
I'm just gonna run to the restroom.
- OK, yeah.

21:47.828 --> 21:51.266
- Excuse me?
Was that Sarah Miles?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.573
The poet?

21:53.616 --> 21:56.358
- Why do you wanna know?
- I'm a lit major.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.795
I'm one of her biggest fans.
Like, she's up there

21:58.839 --> 22:01.058
with Sylvia Plath.
I'd love to meet her.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.844
- Sarah is a very private person.
- Yeah, no worries.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.976
Maybe just an autograph?
- Maybe you could just get lost.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.936
- Take it easy, lady--
- Go!

22:10.764 --> 22:13.810
Get out of here now,

22:13.854 --> 22:16.030
or you'll wish you never met me.

22:16.073 --> 22:19.076
- Listen, I'm just
interested in her work,

22:19.120 --> 22:21.731
that's it.

22:21.775 --> 22:25.387
- Don't touch me!
This guy, he just grabbed me!

22:25.431 --> 22:28.912
- I did not! She's crazy!

22:30.740 --> 22:32.481
- That's right, little boy.

22:32.525 --> 22:35.745
Run away.

22:41.098 --> 22:44.841
- Sarah!

22:44.885 --> 22:48.062
You're really something.
- You're gonna wake Megan. - Did you really think

22:48.105 --> 22:50.151
I wouldn't find out?
- Find out what?

22:50.194 --> 22:52.283
- A divorce lawyer?
- No.

22:52.327 --> 22:55.069
- Son of a bitch had a guy spying on me.
- Daniel, please--

22:55.112 --> 22:58.289
- Shut up! Shut your mouth,
you lying bitch!

22:58.333 --> 23:00.901
Listen close, 'cause here's
what you're gonna do.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.990
Tomorrow morning,
you're gonna call Ms. McKinney

23:03.033 --> 23:05.340
and you're gonna tell her one
of two things. Option A,

23:05.384 --> 23:08.256
you're gonna tell her
you've had a change of heart,

23:08.299 --> 23:10.954
you're sorry, but your services
are no longer required.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.653
Option B, you're gonna have her
file for divorce,

23:13.696 --> 23:18.179
but you're gonna give up all custody rights to Megan, 100 %.
- No, I can't do that.

23:51.734 --> 23:55.477
Ms. McKinney?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.914
Hi, it's Sarah Miles.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.963
- Um...

24:03.006 --> 24:05.574
I've had a change of heart.

24:39.956 --> 24:43.786
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I have a family!

24:43.830 --> 24:47.007
You don't have to do this!

25:05.025 --> 25:08.811
- Ms. Miles? - Yes?
- Detective Collins.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.683
Your husband is Daniel Miles?

25:10.726 --> 25:12.641
- Yes.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.904
Why?

25:19.909 --> 25:22.390
- I'm very sorry

25:22.433 --> 25:25.045
your husband is dead.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.484
- What?

25:29.528 --> 25:32.487
- It appears to have been
a robbery.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.011
He was shot.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.839
His watch and wallet were taken

25:36.883 --> 25:38.972
We got his name

25:39.015 --> 25:41.583
from the car registration.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.281
- Daniel's dead?

25:44.325 --> 25:46.980
- Again, I'm sorry.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.373
Do you know what he was
doing last night?

25:51.158 --> 25:53.726
- He said he was out
with a client.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.250
- Do you know
the client's name?

25:56.293 --> 25:58.469
- No.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.485
- Morning, Mommy.

26:14.529 --> 26:18.011
Good morning, sweetheart.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.891
Honey...

26:28.935 --> 26:31.241
last night,

26:31.285 --> 26:34.680
someone tried to steal
your daddy's money

26:34.723 --> 26:37.030
and they hurt him.

26:37.073 --> 26:40.773
- Oh no... Is he OK?

26:45.604 --> 26:48.171
- He's not OK.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.652
He's, um...
- Where's Daddy?

26:50.696 --> 26:53.220
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry,

26:53.263 --> 26:55.657
but your daddy's not
gonna be coming home.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.572
- What do you mean?

26:57.616 --> 27:01.010
- He's gone, baby.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.534
I'm so sorry.

27:03.578 --> 27:08.627
Your daddy's gone.
- No, you're lying!

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
Daddy?
- No, it's really--

27:10.846 --> 27:13.936
- Daddy! Daddy!

27:23.859 --> 27:28.124
- Most of these people are Daniel's friends.
I don't know what to say to them.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.736
- No one expects you
to say anything.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.350
Let me get that.
- No. No, no, I'll go.

27:36.393 --> 27:39.222
I can't stand still
for too long.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.094
Lee!

27:41.137 --> 27:43.705
- Hey. I'm so sorry.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.490
I heard about Daniel
on the news.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.972
I should've called,
I didn't realize--

27:50.016 --> 27:53.019
- Oh, no! Come in!
- Are you sure?

27:53.062 --> 27:56.283
- Of course.
- OK.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.768
- The victim was definitely
screwing around on his wife.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.988
I talked to the girl he was with.
She says it was their first time.

28:06.032 --> 28:09.296
I got the sense it wasn't his.
- Any witnesses?

28:09.339 --> 28:12.516
- Couple people heard shots,
nobody saw anything.

28:12.560 --> 28:17.565
- There have been a bunch of drug-related
robbery homicides in that area just like this one.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.741
- Except for the car.

28:19.785 --> 28:23.571
- Car?
- If it was a straight robbery, why didn't they take the car?

28:23.614 --> 28:26.400
The keys were right in his hand.
- Maybe the guy panicked.

28:26.443 --> 28:30.447
- Maybe.
- You're thinking what, jealous boyfriend or husband?

28:30.491 --> 28:33.668
- Maybe the guy's wife.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.541
Plus he owns a construction business.
Could have ties to organized crime.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.979
- You know, Chris,

28:40.022 --> 28:43.243
sometimes a robbery
is just a robbery.

28:43.286 --> 28:46.376
- I'm not feeling this is
one of those times.

28:52.165 --> 28:56.125
- Lee, you don't have
to do that.

28:56.169 --> 29:00.651
- It's the least I can do.
- Megan asleep?

29:02.436 --> 29:05.134
- Finally.
- How is she doing?

29:05.178 --> 29:08.921
- There aren't words.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.750
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.926
- Thank you, Nina.

29:19.061 --> 29:22.325
I can't believe that he's gone.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.854
It's weird.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.856
I feel guilty.

29:30.899 --> 29:33.772
- Guilty?

29:33.815 --> 29:36.644
- It's not...
like I'm happy

29:36.687 --> 29:41.214
that he's dead, it's just--
- I had to wait for my father

29:41.257 --> 29:44.391
to kill himself before I could
start living my life.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.916
You can start living now.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.310
Really living.

29:50.353 --> 29:54.053
That's nothing
to feel guilty about.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.751
- Because we are all
God's children,

29:56.795 --> 29:59.928
and with that in mind,
we can find peace.

29:59.972 --> 30:03.627
Ashes to ashes,

30:03.671 --> 30:06.892
dust to dust.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.607
- Here we are.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.827
- I'm not hungry.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.918
- Sweetheart, can you try
to eat something, please?

30:32.961 --> 30:35.877
- That's Daddy's place!

30:35.921 --> 30:38.706
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Megan.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.883
- It's OK. I understand.

30:41.927 --> 30:45.017
Hey, you know,

30:45.060 --> 30:47.584
my mom passed away

30:47.628 --> 30:51.110
just a little while ago, and
every night when I come home

30:51.153 --> 30:53.764
from work, I still expect
to see her there,

30:53.808 --> 30:56.855
waiting for me.

30:56.898 --> 31:00.423
- Do you miss her?
- Of course I miss her.

31:00.467 --> 31:03.905
But I have to believe that
she's in a much better place.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.733
- Heaven?

31:05.776 --> 31:08.823
- With all the angels.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.618
She asleep?
- Finally.

31:21.662 --> 31:25.274
- Hey, uh,

31:25.318 --> 31:27.929
I got you a little something.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.888
- What's the occasion?

31:29.931 --> 31:33.413
- I don't know. Call it
a thank-you gift.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.110
- Thank you for what?

31:35.154 --> 31:38.244
- For being my friend.

31:41.508 --> 31:45.294
- Oh, I love Byron and Keats!
- I thought you might.

31:45.338 --> 31:48.297
It's a special edition.
- Lee...

31:48.341 --> 31:50.778
This must have cost a lot.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.823
- Ma left me some money

31:52.867 --> 31:55.696
and I don't have anything else
to spend it on, so...

31:57.524 --> 32:00.701
- Well, thank you...
for the thank-you.

32:00.744 --> 32:03.486
- You're welcome.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.232
- Sarah, your work
has really evolved.

32:10.276 --> 32:14.019
The complexity,
the depth, the honesty...

32:14.062 --> 32:18.501
A few more pieces
- the right pieces- and there's another book here.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.722
- You really think so?
- I do.

32:21.765 --> 32:24.203
But if I'm gonna
publish you again,

32:24.246 --> 32:27.380
I need to know that you're
100 % committed this time.

32:30.861 --> 32:34.474
- I have never been more clear
about what I want.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.476
And I'm willing to do

32:36.519 --> 32:39.044
whatever it takes
to make that happen.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.656
- I can't wait for the book to come out.
- Actually, would you mind

32:42.699 --> 32:45.441
taking a look at a few
of my pieces in advance?

32:45.485 --> 32:48.270
- Really? I would be
honored, yes.

32:48.314 --> 32:51.665
- You have to promise to be brutally honest.
- Cross my heart.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.058
Hey...

32:53.101 --> 32:55.495
we should celebrate.
Would you want to go for drinks

32:55.538 --> 32:57.932
Friday night?
- I...

32:57.976 --> 33:01.457
I don't think that I'm up
for a night on the town yet.

33:03.242 --> 33:07.028
- Well, at least you've
embraced being single.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.248
- I don't know, Lee,
I felt like...

33:09.291 --> 33:13.034
I've been living
someone else's life,

33:13.078 --> 33:15.689
and now that life is gone.

33:15.732 --> 33:19.040
- You just need to start
living your own now.

33:19.084 --> 33:22.348
It's gonna be so much
better, I promise.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.490
"Searching, seeking,
something amiss...

33:34.534 --> 33:38.929
"Wandering lost...

33:38.973 --> 33:42.368
A crystal mist."

33:44.326 --> 33:48.069
It's a beautiful piece.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.506
- But?

33:50.550 --> 33:53.857
- Well, you have this image
down here, "Wandering lost",

33:53.901 --> 33:56.556
and a crystal mist,
which is brilliant,

33:56.599 --> 34:00.081
but I just feel
like, earlier...

34:00.125 --> 34:02.083
something's missing.

34:02.127 --> 34:05.913
- Hmm. I see.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.306
- I'm probably wrong.

34:08.350 --> 34:10.657
- No. No, no, you're
absolutely right.

34:10.699 --> 34:14.268
I've been so worried,
it's been hard to focus.

34:14.313 --> 34:17.577
Lee, I really
appreciate your help.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.275
- I really appreciate you.

34:20.319 --> 34:24.670
- Mommy, come see
what I made!

34:24.714 --> 34:28.022
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

34:31.373 --> 34:34.114
- Sweetheart, that's beautiful!

34:34.159 --> 34:35.985
- Nina helped me.

34:36.030 --> 34:39.338
- Only a little. Your daughter's
quite the artist.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.994
- Nina,

34:44.038 --> 34:47.433
you need a vacation.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.391
- What do you think?

34:50.436 --> 34:53.612
- I think it's perfect.

34:53.656 --> 34:56.703
- You're getting soft.

34:56.746 --> 35:00.533
- No, no,
really. It is.

35:00.576 --> 35:04.537
Hey, uh... There's
this jazz band that I love

35:04.580 --> 35:07.888
and they're playing Saturday
night. I thought we could go.

35:07.931 --> 35:11.065
- I can't.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.503
- Sarah, you've been working so hard.
- I know.

35:14.547 --> 35:18.333
It helps me keep my mind off...

35:18.377 --> 35:20.727
- I know.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.121
But... you need to
blow off some steam.

35:23.164 --> 35:26.733
- Actually, I'm going to an
event with my publisher

35:26.776 --> 35:28.735
that night.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.824
He said that there are some
people that I have to meet.

35:30.867 --> 35:34.958
- Oh.
- Trust me, it's the last thing I wanna be doing.

35:35.002 --> 35:38.919
- I'd watch out for him
if I were you.

35:38.962 --> 35:40.703
- Will?

35:40.747 --> 35:42.879
- I've seen the way
he looks at you.

35:45.404 --> 35:49.538
- He's... he's just a friend.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.939
- I'm gonna go make us
some tea, yeah?

37:00.479 --> 37:02.698
- Mommy?

37:02.742 --> 37:06.354
Why did someone kill Daddy?

37:11.446 --> 37:13.231
- People do bad things

37:13.274 --> 37:17.887
for a lot of reasons.
- Will the police get them?

37:17.931 --> 37:21.282
- I hope so.

37:21.326 --> 37:24.372
- Me too.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.786
We did manage to find
one witness.

37:46.829 --> 37:49.832
They were out walking their dog
and noticed someone sitting

37:49.876 --> 37:52.008
in an older model sedan.
When they heard shots,

37:52.052 --> 37:54.533
they looked out, saw the shooter
run back to that same car

37:54.576 --> 37:57.144
and drive off.

37:57.187 --> 38:00.147
- So you... you're saying that
someone was waiting for him?

38:00.190 --> 38:01.975
Waiting to kill him?

38:02.018 --> 38:05.457
- So it would appear.
- Um...

38:05.500 --> 38:07.981
Well, I do know

38:08.024 --> 38:11.637
that he dealt with some unsavory
characters in his business.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.640
- Can you give me some names?
- No,

38:14.683 --> 38:17.686
Daniel always
spared me the details.

38:17.730 --> 38:21.211
- You said you were at home the night your husband was killed.
- Yes, with my daughter.

38:21.255 --> 38:24.650
- Ms. Miles, did you know
about your husband's affairs?

38:29.394 --> 38:32.179
- I suspected.

38:32.222 --> 38:35.965
- Must have
made you angry.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.098
- I'm sorry,

38:38.141 --> 38:40.143
you don't think that I--

38:40.187 --> 38:44.670
- It's my job to consider every possibility.
- This is crazy.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.499
I didn't kill
my husband.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.675
I don't know who did.

38:51.329 --> 38:56.072
Look, if there's nothing else,
I'd like to get home to my daughter.

39:29.323 --> 39:33.109
- To Sarah Miles, poet laureate.
- Thanks.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.984
- I thought we were supposed
to be celebrating.

39:38.027 --> 39:41.422
What's wrong?

39:41.466 --> 39:45.295
- The police... think
that I killed Daniel.

39:45.339 --> 39:48.386
- That's ridiculous.

39:48.429 --> 39:51.084
- I don't know what to do.

39:51.127 --> 39:54.043
- OK, well,
try to calm down.

39:54.087 --> 39:58.265
What did they say exactly?
- Apparently, there was a witness to the shooting.

39:58.308 --> 40:01.137
- A witness?

40:01.181 --> 40:02.965
- Some neighbor.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.708
They saw someone waiting
outside that girl's apartment,

40:06.752 --> 40:08.971
so now the police think
that it was planned.

40:09.015 --> 40:11.626
- Did they say that they got a
good look at this person's face?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.628
- No, no, but the cops know

40:13.672 --> 40:17.980
about Daniel's cheating, so...
- Sarah, you didn't kill Daniel,

40:18.024 --> 40:21.244
did you?
- No, of course not!

40:21.288 --> 40:24.030
- OK, so then they have no proof.
You've got nothing to worry about.

40:26.772 --> 40:30.297
- What about the wife?
- She says she was at home with her daughter.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.256
- You talk to the kid?
- She was asleep at the time.

40:33.300 --> 40:37.696
- That's convenient.
- Anyway, her car doesn't fit the description.

40:39.567 --> 40:43.092
- She could've hired someone.
- Her husband controlled all the money.

40:43.136 --> 40:47.227
If she paid a hitman, she did it
with loose change and coupons.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.316
- Or she made a deal.

40:49.359 --> 40:53.233
Cash on delivery.
- She does have a lot of it now.

41:08.117 --> 41:11.207
Nina?

41:11.251 --> 41:14.863
- Megan, call 911!

41:14.907 --> 41:17.692
- Someone's chipper.
- A little.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.694
- New man in your life?

41:19.738 --> 41:21.783
- No.
- Woman?

41:21.827 --> 41:24.612
- Yeah. But not in the way
you're thinking.

41:24.656 --> 41:27.833
- Too bad, because the way
I'm thinking is pretty hot.

41:30.749 --> 41:34.709
- Hey, uh... have you
ever had a friend

41:34.753 --> 41:37.146
and it's like they're
a part of you?

41:37.190 --> 41:39.932
Like the part that's been
missing or something?

41:39.975 --> 41:42.238
- None that I'm not
sleeping with.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.545
- Can't you get your mind out
of the gutter for one second?

41:44.589 --> 41:46.721
- Now why would I do that?

41:52.466 --> 41:55.600
- I got here as quick as I could. What happened?
- They're not sure.

41:55.643 --> 41:59.647
Food poisoning maybe.
- She was really sick.

41:59.691 --> 42:02.171
- Is she gonna be all right?

42:02.215 --> 42:05.348
- I hope so. They said she needs
to rest for at least a week,

42:05.392 --> 42:07.873
maybe two.

42:07.916 --> 42:11.572
- If you need anything, anything
at all, I'm here for you.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.749
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:16.969 --> 42:20.146
- Actually, there is one thing.

42:20.189 --> 42:23.236
Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

42:25.107 --> 42:29.111
- So, she's had
her bath and her dinner,

42:29.155 --> 42:31.461
and you have my cell
if you need anything.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.942
- Yes. Don't worry, we'll be
fine. Won't we, munchkin?

42:33.986 --> 42:36.423
- Uh-huh.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.686
- Thank you again so much
for helping me out.

42:38.730 --> 42:42.255
Of course.

42:50.176 --> 42:53.440
- Hey.

42:53.483 --> 42:56.269
Wow!

42:56.312 --> 42:58.053
You look great.

42:58.097 --> 43:00.969
- Thanks. So do you.

43:01.013 --> 43:04.016
- Thanks.
- What time will you be home?

43:04.059 --> 43:06.627
- We shouldn't be too late.
- I'll call you.

43:06.671 --> 43:09.412
- OK. See you soon.

43:27.430 --> 43:30.346
- Sarah, the Millers
just got here.

43:30.390 --> 43:32.479
Do you feel like
joining the party?

43:32.522 --> 43:35.482
- Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

43:37.484 --> 43:39.921
- Are you all right?

43:39.965 --> 43:42.402
- Yeah, uh...

43:42.445 --> 43:45.971
It's just,
it's hard to engage in polite conversation with everything

43:46.014 --> 43:49.583
that's been going on lately.
- You mean with your housekeeper.

43:51.367 --> 43:54.414
- And the fact that I'm being investigated for Daniel's murder.

43:54.457 --> 43:57.460
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently,

43:57.504 --> 44:00.463
Daniel's cheating
makes me a suspect.

44:00.507 --> 44:04.076
- OK, Sarah, you need a lawyer.
- I have one.

44:04.119 --> 44:07.035
Colton Friedman? My divorce
attorney referred me.

44:07.079 --> 44:09.037
- I know him.
He's excellent.

44:09.081 --> 44:13.476
- I'm meeting with him on Monday.
- Great.

45:18.411 --> 45:20.935
Hey. Is she asleep?

45:20.979 --> 45:22.981
- Like an angel.

45:23.024 --> 45:25.635
- I shouldn't be
too much longer.

45:25.679 --> 45:28.464
- No, no, no. Your career's
important. Take your time.

45:28.508 --> 45:31.119
- All right.
If you need anything,

45:31.163 --> 45:33.948
text me.
- I have everything I need.

46:32.311 --> 46:34.617
Some more waffles, munchkin?

46:34.661 --> 46:39.361
- No, thanks. I'm full.
- Me too. Thanks again, this was amazing.

46:39.405 --> 46:42.016
- Can I go play in my room?

46:42.060 --> 46:44.540
- Of course,
sweetheart.

46:46.978 --> 46:49.415
Oh no, no, no, Lee.
Leave them.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.809
- But it's no big deal.
- No, please.

46:51.852 --> 46:54.724
You've done enough, really.
- Are you sure?

46:54.768 --> 46:57.336
- Sit.
- OK.

47:01.427 --> 47:03.342
Uh...

47:03.385 --> 47:06.171
Hey, you know, I was thinking...

47:06.214 --> 47:10.610
if the cops do decide to charge you with Daniel's murder,
I can say I was with you that night.

47:10.653 --> 47:15.136
- I already told them that
I was with Megan at home.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.878
- So say that
you made a mistake,

47:17.922 --> 47:19.924
that you got confused.

47:19.967 --> 47:22.491
- I don't know.

47:22.535 --> 47:25.538
- Without an alibi, a jury's
gonna think the worst.

47:28.062 --> 47:31.196
- Well, I appreciate
the offer.

47:31.239 --> 47:34.634
Let's wait and see
what happens.

47:52.957 --> 47:57.091
- Hi, can I please get the number for Solomon House Publishing?

47:58.919 --> 48:02.401
- From what I can gather so far the police have found nothing concrete.

48:02.444 --> 48:04.882
- That's because
I'm innocent.

48:04.925 --> 48:09.712
- That doesn't preclude them from building a circumstantial case.

48:11.540 --> 48:15.544
Is there anything else
that you haven't told me?

48:19.157 --> 48:21.855
Anything at all.

48:24.989 --> 48:27.861
- My husband, um...

48:27.905 --> 48:31.430
he hit me.

48:31.473 --> 48:33.911
- Do the police know?

48:33.954 --> 48:35.825
- No.

48:35.869 --> 48:37.697
I didn't tell them.

48:37.740 --> 48:42.006
It only happened once.
- Does anybody else know?

48:42.049 --> 48:45.487
Your daughter?
- No.

48:45.531 --> 48:47.359
No, no one.

48:47.402 --> 48:49.709
- All right.
Let's keep it that way.

48:49.752 --> 48:53.756
And please, don't say anything
more to the police without me.

49:02.722 --> 49:05.464
- Lee, what are you doing here?
- I have good news.

49:05.507 --> 49:09.381
- You could've called.
- This is "in person" news. - OK.

49:09.424 --> 49:11.383
- Solomon House
is interested in you.

49:11.426 --> 49:14.386
- What?
- They're the biggest publishers in the city.

49:14.429 --> 49:16.910
- I know who they are.
How do they know about me?

49:16.954 --> 49:20.566
- I sent them some of your poems.
- You shouldn't have.

49:20.609 --> 49:25.484
- It's the least I could do.
- No, I mean you shouldn't have. Not without asking me first.

49:25.527 --> 49:28.269
I already have
a publisher.

49:28.313 --> 49:32.186
- I know, but he's small-time.

49:32.230 --> 49:34.188
You deserve better.

49:34.232 --> 49:37.496
- Will knows me. He knows my work.
- He's using you,

49:37.539 --> 49:40.499
just like Daniel.
- Will is nothing like Daniel.

49:40.542 --> 49:43.284
He's my friend.
- I'm your friend.

49:43.328 --> 49:45.286
I... I want what's best

49:45.330 --> 49:47.854
for you and for your career--
- Lee, look,

49:47.897 --> 49:51.727
I appreciate you trying to help,
but I know what I'm doing.

49:51.771 --> 49:54.252
- You haven't published
in seven years, Sarah!

49:56.732 --> 49:58.691
- I have to go
pick up Megan soon.

49:58.734 --> 50:01.041
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

50:01.085 --> 50:04.914
It's just, this is an amazing opportunity.
Wait till you meet the woman from Solomon House--

50:04.958 --> 50:08.483
- I'm not meeting anyone.
Will has believed in me

50:08.527 --> 50:11.138
since the very beginning.
He's earned my loyalty.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.532
- I'm sure you thought the same about Daniel.
- Will you stop

50:13.575 --> 50:16.796
bringing up Daniel? Whatever his faults, he is dead now.
- Yeah, he is.

50:16.839 --> 50:19.016
That's right,
and he deserved it.

50:19.059 --> 50:22.149
- That is way out of line.

50:22.193 --> 50:25.805
- Sarah, I--
- I have to go.

50:25.848 --> 50:27.850
- Wait!

50:48.001 --> 50:52.353
- Who is it, Mom?
- No one, sweetie. Eat your dinner.

50:59.099 --> 51:00.970
Lee's getting to be a bit much.

51:01.014 --> 51:03.669
- Yeah, sounds like it.
Although...

51:03.712 --> 51:06.541
Solomon House is
pretty impressive.

51:06.585 --> 51:09.849
- Don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere.

51:09.892 --> 51:11.459
- I'm glad.

51:18.031 --> 51:19.815
- She just keeps calling.

51:19.859 --> 51:22.296
- You know you can block
her number, right?

51:22.340 --> 51:24.864
- Looks like I'll have to.

51:30.043 --> 51:33.873
- It's me again.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.919
We really need to talk.

51:38.965 --> 51:42.708
- Oh, come on!

51:49.976 --> 51:53.414
You can't just show up
like this, Lee.

51:53.458 --> 51:55.895
- Sarah, please.
- I'm serious.

51:55.938 --> 51:58.941
No more calls, no gifts.
- You're upset, I understand.

51:58.985 --> 52:01.857
I went way too far,
I can see that now.

52:01.901 --> 52:05.426
- Listen to me. - I just wanted to help.
- You want to help?

52:06.297 --> 52:09.126
Give me some space, all right?

52:09.169 --> 52:12.999
- I would do anything for you!
Don't you know that? Anything!

52:13.042 --> 52:14.957
- Then leave me alone!

52:15.001 --> 52:17.873
I'm being investigated
for murder, for God's sake!

52:17.917 --> 52:19.919
- You don't have
to worry about that.

52:19.962 --> 52:22.443
- What do you mean?

52:22.487 --> 52:25.446
- Just that... you're innocent.

52:25.490 --> 52:29.276
- How do you know?
You don't even know me.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.844
- I do know you.

52:31.887 --> 52:34.673
I know that you're
caring and kind,

52:34.716 --> 52:38.416
too kind to hurt anyone,
even if someone deserved it.

52:38.459 --> 52:41.506
- You said that before.

52:41.549 --> 52:44.117
Daniel did not deserve to die.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.293
- He should've never
laid a hand on you.

52:46.337 --> 52:48.861
- What did you just say?

52:48.904 --> 52:52.647
- I said he didn't
deserve you.

52:52.691 --> 52:55.607
- How do you know
that he hit me?

52:55.650 --> 52:58.218
- You told me.

52:58.262 --> 53:01.221
- No, I didn't.
- Well, then I must have picked it up from your work.

53:01.265 --> 53:03.876
- I never wrote about it.
It only happened once.

53:03.919 --> 53:07.836
Were you spying on me?
- Of course not.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.884
Sarah, please--
- I have to go. Goodbye, Lee.

53:39.607 --> 53:42.784
Hi, it's Sarah Miles.

53:42.828 --> 53:46.614
There's someone that
you need to look into.

53:48.573 --> 53:51.053
- I hope you don't mind
coming all the way down here,

53:51.097 --> 53:54.970
but I told Friedman I thought
we should meet in person.

53:55.014 --> 53:57.843
- That's fine.
- This Lee

53:57.886 --> 54:01.760
sounds like a real piece of work.
- Yes, she is.

54:01.803 --> 54:05.590
- Now, she does own
a late model sedan.

54:05.633 --> 54:08.027
Do you think
she killed your husband?

54:09.855 --> 54:13.293
- I don't know, but...
she's been stalking me

54:13.337 --> 54:16.078
and she seems unstable.

54:25.958 --> 54:29.527
- You told me before
that you knew

54:29.570 --> 54:33.357
about your husband's infidelity.
- I also told you that I didn't kill him.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.881
- Yes, but you neglected to mention that you were going to leave him.

54:35.924 --> 54:39.363
I subpoenaed your
phone records.

54:39.406 --> 54:43.367
Jean McKinney is the best divorce lawyer in the city.
- Any conversation

54:43.410 --> 54:46.152
my client may or may not have had with an attorney is privileged.

54:46.195 --> 54:50.504
- Would've been tough to get that divorce,
what with the prenup.

54:50.548 --> 54:53.464
We found a copy in
your husband's office.

54:53.507 --> 54:56.467
- We're done here.
- What happened?

54:56.510 --> 55:00.079
McKinney couldn't get proof,
so you opted for a more permanent solution?

55:00.122 --> 55:03.343
- No! - Don't say another word.
- Or did your husband find out

55:03.387 --> 55:05.040
what you were up to and threaten
you? Because if that's the case,

55:05.084 --> 55:07.782
you might be able to plead
justifiable homicide.

55:07.826 --> 55:11.656
- I didn't kill Daniel.
- Are you arresting her?

55:11.699 --> 55:14.354
- Not at the moment.
- Didn't think so.

55:14.398 --> 55:17.096
Come on, let's get you home.

55:29.151 --> 55:30.544
- Hey.

55:30.588 --> 55:33.330
You need anything
before I head home?

55:33.373 --> 55:35.854
- No, thank you.
How are you feeling?

55:35.897 --> 55:39.379
- Good. Much better.
- I'm really glad you're back.

55:39.423 --> 55:42.251
- Me too. Night, Megan.

55:42.295 --> 55:45.211
- Night, Nina.

55:45.254 --> 55:48.083
- OK, you. Bedtime.

55:50.956 --> 55:53.698
- When is Auntie Lee
coming over?

55:56.831 --> 55:59.399
- I don't know.
- Can she come tomorrow?

55:59.443 --> 56:02.750
- I don't think so, sweetheart.

56:04.448 --> 56:08.190
You know,
she's been so busy lately that I have hardly seen her myself.

56:08.234 --> 56:11.933
- OK. Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, sweetheart.

57:44.983 --> 57:48.290
- Is this what
you're looking for?

57:49.335 --> 57:51.859
You didn't think I'd know
you'd show up here?

58:50.309 --> 58:52.354
- I heard from Friedman.

58:52.398 --> 58:55.575
Crawford, the investigator?
He's missing.

58:55.619 --> 58:58.447
- What happened?
- Nobody knows.

58:58.491 --> 59:00.885
Apparently, he didn't
come home last night

59:00.928 --> 59:03.757
and no one can reach him,
not even his wife.

59:03.801 --> 59:06.238
- You don't think that it might be--
- All I know

59:06.281 --> 59:09.371
is that he was going to investigate Lee and now he's gone.

59:09.415 --> 59:12.244
- All right, you have to go
to the police right now.

59:12.287 --> 59:15.029
- With what? I don't
have any proof,

59:15.073 --> 59:18.598
not to mention they think
that I killed Daniel.

59:18.642 --> 59:21.775
What I need
is evidence.

59:21.819 --> 59:24.256
- If there is any.
- There has to be.

59:24.299 --> 59:27.302
- Sarah, if you're right
about Lee, then...

59:27.346 --> 59:30.567
there's no way you can be around
her, it's way too dangerous.

59:30.610 --> 59:34.135
- The only thing that
I have going in my favor

59:34.179 --> 59:36.834
is the way that
she feels about me.

59:36.877 --> 59:38.966
If I play into that,

59:39.010 --> 59:42.579
maybe she'll let her guard down.
- Yeah, and maybe you'll go missing.

59:42.622 --> 59:45.190
- There is no other way.

59:45.233 --> 59:48.280
Megan just lost
her father and...

59:48.323 --> 59:51.762
I'm not about to let her grow up
with her mother in prison.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.768
- OK.

01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:08.213
Hey.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.089
I was wrong and you were right.

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:18.702
Really?

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:22.270
If it's not too late,
I would still like to meet with Solomon House.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:29.234
- I'm really sorry, Lee.
It's... it's been so long since I had a real friend.

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:36.894
- Just working until 6.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.504
- Let me make you dinner.

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:42.203
To celebrate. - Yeah, I'd love that.

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:44.858
If we do it at your place?
Nina's gonna watch Megan.

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:48.470
That way, you know, it'll just be the two of us.
- Sounds perfect.

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:52.170
- Yeah, it does.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:58.480
- Welcome.
- Nice place.

01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:01.005
- Thanks. Come on in.

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:03.398
Sarah, that was...

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.532
amazing.
- It's my pleasure.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.233
- Wait.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:18.892
Here's... to us always
being there for each other,

01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:21.895
no matter what. To us.

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:25.246
- To us.

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:33.559
Why don't you go relax
and I'll get dessert out?

01:01:33.602 --> 01:01:36.214
- OK.

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:09.682
- Tada!
- Oh, wow! You really went all out!

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.903
- Like the song says,
that's what friends are for.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:20.606
There's more
if you want.

01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:23.130
- I'm good.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:29.789
I feel a little sick.
- Too much wine?

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.661
- I'll be right back.

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:03.910
Lee?

01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:07.000
Are you OK?

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:23.103
Lee?

01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.753
- Yeah, I need the police.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:50.930
My friend, she just...
tried to kill me.

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.892
- What?

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:58.111
Oh no, no...

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:08.948
- Step out of the car
with your hands up!

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:12.865
Let me see
those hands!

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.955
- What did I do?

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:18.697
- Turn around!

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.365
- I can explain that!
- You can explain to the detectives.

01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:41.024
- Sorry you had
to wait so long

01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:44.418
in holding. I was out all night
on another crime scene.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:49.380
- I really can explain everything.
- One sec.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:01.827
- For the record, against
the advice of counsel.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:04.003
- I have nothing to hide.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:08.268
- Your friend, Lee Maxson,
says you confessed to killing your husband.

01:06:08.312 --> 01:06:12.577
- That's a lie.
- That 9mm automatic we found in your car is on its way

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.710
to ballistics.
- That's hers. That's Lee's.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:19.627
- How about you start
from the beginning?

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:31.683
- Sounds crazy all right.
- I don't know.

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:34.294
- Don't tell me you believe her.
- Well, the PI she hired,

01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:38.472
Paul Crawford, is missing.
His car was found at a parking garage downtown. No prints.

01:06:38.516 --> 01:06:42.476
- You've got a jealous wife,
who admits she knew about her husband's affairs--plural.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.392
If the ballistics come back
positive, it's a slam dunk.

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:49.657
- Why would she be so careful
to use an unregistered gun,

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:53.879
wipe it clean of prints,
and then be so careless to drive around with all that evidence?

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:56.925
- Ours is not to reason why.

01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:00.973
Let the DA deal with
conspiracy theories.

01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:08.067
- Thank you for getting me out on bail.
- Oh, we're just lucky

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:11.723
the judge has a soft spot
for kids. Thank Megan for that.

01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:15.640
You do understand you won't be able to leave your house until the trial.

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:19.296
- Well, I have this
to remind me.

01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:23.082
- She's saying

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:25.084
I killed her husband?
- She's rather adamant about it.

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:28.566
- If there's anything I'm guilty
of, it's not calling you

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:31.656
when I first suspected what she'd done.
- Why didn't you?

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:34.485
- Well, what I told myself
at the time

01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:37.923
was that she couldn't have
done it. But now...

01:07:37.966 --> 01:07:39.185
- But now?

01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:42.449
- Deep down, I think
I always knew.

01:07:42.493 --> 01:07:44.364
But I felt
sorry for her.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:47.715
He hit her, you know.
Did she tell you that?

01:07:47.759 --> 01:07:50.936
- No.
- He hit her that night.

01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.720
- How do you know?

01:07:52.764 --> 01:07:56.463
- She told me. That's why
I went right over there.

01:07:56.507 --> 01:07:58.509
After we talked for a while,

01:07:58.552 --> 01:08:02.339
she asked me if I could watch Megan so
she could take a drive to clear her head.

01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:04.297
- A drive in your car?
- Yeah,

01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:08.040
it was parked behind hers in the driveway.
It was just easier for her, I guess.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.869
- Ms. Miles also accuses you

01:08:10.912 --> 01:08:12.871
of killing a private
investigator she hired,

01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:16.787
Paul Crawford.
- I don't even know who that is.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:19.006
Plus, uh,

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:21.140
I hate guns.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.274
My father killed
himself with one.

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:29.192
- How does it work?
- Well,

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:32.325
if Mommy were to leave the house,
the police would know where I went.

01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:34.197
- Why does the police
think you're bad?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.591
- I told you, sweetheart, it's a mistake.
- What kind of mistake?

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:39.854
- I will explain it

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:42.292
when you're older, OK?
I promise.

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:45.729
Now come on,
it's time for bed.

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:54.260
- Am I still gonna go to school?

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.654
- Of course. Nina will take you.

01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:00.787
- What are you gonna do?

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.228
- I'm gonna fix the mistake.

01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:15.020
- I thought you were my friend.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.212
- So, I got you some

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:36.649
Colombian coffee, a couple
good books that I know

01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:40.176
you haven't read yet, and a few
treats from my favorite deli.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:43.831
- You're too good to me, Will.
- I wish I could do more.

01:09:45.877 --> 01:09:47.444
- Maybe you can.

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:49.924
According
to my lawyer,

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:53.493
it's going to be my word against
Lee's. She presents herself

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:56.061
as this delicate little flower,
but she is as twisted

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:58.803
as they come and I can't be
the only one who sees that.

01:09:58.846 --> 01:10:01.893
- Friedman knows what he's talking about.
- This is my life, Will.

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:04.374
My daughter.

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:06.985
I have to do something!
- OK.

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:11.076
It's gonna be OK.
Where do you want to start?

01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:23.915
Oh, so you did know Lee?

01:10:26.918 --> 01:10:28.920
Oh. I see.

01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:31.183
OK, well, thank you.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:35.274
- Thanks for talking to me.

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:38.277
Your neighbors haven't
exactly been forthcoming

01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:40.714
with me.
- Well, this town

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:43.935
is like its own little world and
they like to keep it that way.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:46.633
Actually, I used
to teach English

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:49.462
over at the high school.
Lee was one of my students.

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:52.291
- What can you tell me
about Lee?

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:56.687
- Well, you know, Lee was...
Lee was always very intelligent,

01:10:56.730 --> 01:11:00.865
you know, thoughtful--
soulful, actually, but quiet.

01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:03.650
She kept to herself
and I always suspected

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.783
from her behavior that
there were problems at home.

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.699
Could never get her
to open up, though.

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:11.702
It only got worse after
her father killed himself.

01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:14.400
- Yeah, worse how?
- Well,

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:18.709
after the old man's funeral,
she got into a screaming match with one of the other students.

01:11:18.752 --> 01:11:22.452
It got physical. The other girl
ended up in the hospital.

01:11:22.495 --> 01:11:24.454
- You know what they were
fighting about?

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:26.282
- Don't know.

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:28.893
They wouldn't say. Got suspended
for a week, though.

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:31.330
- Do you remember
the other kid's name?

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.332
- Yeah, sure,
I remember them all.

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:35.595
Maggie. Maggie Davis.

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:39.251
Maggie Davis, yeah.

01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:58.096
- Maggie, Lee killed my husband.

01:11:58.139 --> 01:12:01.186
And we think that she killed
another man, too.

01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:12.458
Told someone what?

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:06.077
- Wanna take Caramel?
- Hmm,

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.211
he'll just stay with Mommy.
- OK, that should do it.

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:11.909
- I don't wanna go.

01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:14.651
- I know, sweetheart.
It's only for one night.

01:13:14.694 --> 01:13:18.132
Mommy and Mr. Lawrence just
have some things to figure out.

01:13:18.176 --> 01:13:20.439
- With the police?
- With the police.

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:22.310
Hey.

01:13:22.354 --> 01:13:27.272
Everything is gonna be
OK, I promise.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.191
- Your mom's a very smart lady, Megan.
- I know.

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:36.237
- Who do you want
to bring with you?

01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:39.850
- Hmm... Dolphinia.

01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:42.200
- That's a good choice.

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:45.029
Come on, sweetie.

01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:13.361
- You're saying she murdered
her father, made it look

01:14:13.405 --> 01:14:16.626
like suicide.
- I'm not saying it. She did.

01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:20.499
Talk to her friend Maggie.
- I will. I'll talk to the local cops too, but...

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:24.547
- But what?
- Even if she did kill her father,

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:26.418
it doesn't change
anything for you.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.290
Hell, it wouldn't even be
admissible in court.

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:32.380
- Look, um, Lee's
the star witness, right?

01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:35.906
Couldn't you go to the DA
and convince him

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:38.778
to just hold off,
take a look at the case?

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:43.391
- I don't know. Maybe.

01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:51.312
- You know, we do
have a guest room.

01:14:51.356 --> 01:14:54.011
- I like the sofa. Sometimes
I even sleep on it at home.

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:57.318
- I really appreciate
you being here.

01:14:57.362 --> 01:15:02.236
- No problem.
I just wish the circumstances could be different.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.196
- So do I.

01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:15.902
Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.353
- Will?

01:15:35.226 --> 01:15:38.446
Will?

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:50.458
Will?

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:59.467
Will?
- Not much of a boyfriend.

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.166
- How did you get in here?

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:04.995
- Daniel kept a spare key
in his wallet.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.782
Don't you move.

01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:11.828
You stay right there.

01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:14.526
- What do you want?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.094
- I thought you were my friend.

01:16:17.137 --> 01:16:20.967
I thought you would
always be my friend.

01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:24.405
I thought we were
soulmates, Sarah.

01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:27.017
- Please...

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:30.324
Put the gun down.
Let's just talk.

01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:32.805
- So you can lie to me some more?
- Lee, please--

01:16:32.849 --> 01:16:36.330
- Shut up!
Shut your mouth" After everything I've done for you!

01:16:36.374 --> 01:16:40.900
- You framed me for murder!
- You gave me no choice!

01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:43.120
You rejected me!

01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:46.210
And you still didn't learn your
lesson, digging into my past!

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:50.127
- It's not just me.
The police know too.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.565
- What do they know?

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.612
- That you killed
your father.

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:59.397
- My father was a monster!
But they couldn't prove

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.008
that I killed him any more that
they can prove I killed Daniel.

01:17:03.793 --> 01:17:06.665
- Lee... please...

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:09.102
- I looked up to you, Sarah.

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:14.673
Your words spoke to me unlike
anyone else's. But in the end,

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:18.677
that's all they were.
Empty, hollow,

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:22.289
meaningless words!
- Lee...

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:25.075
if you kill me--
- I'm not gonna kill you,

01:17:25.118 --> 01:17:28.992
Sarah. You're gonna
kill yourself.

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:35.215
Get on your blog!
- Lee, please-- - Do it now!

01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:40.177
Keep it short and sweet.
- What? - Your suicide note.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.660
Or should I say poem, only seems thin, don't you think?
- Lee! Lee, think about this!

01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:47.706
- Oh, I have thought about it.
It's actually all

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:50.491
I've been thinking about, Sarah!
- What about Will?

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:53.451
No one's gonna believe that I did that to him.
- Well, you don't have to worry

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:55.888
about Will, 'cause I know
how to make someone disappear.

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:58.586
- Please don't do this.
- Get busy.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:03.374
And make it good. This'll be
the last poem you ever write.

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:07.247
- Please, Lee...

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:09.032
Megan needs me.

01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:12.557
- I needed you!
I needed you and you turned

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.646
your back on me!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.866
But maybe she'll be my friend.

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:20.173
- No, you can't.

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:22.741
You can't.
She's not even here.

01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:26.440
- I know. She's with Nina.

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.618
- Please, Lee. Please don't.

01:18:30.662 --> 01:18:32.446
- Well, I need something
to remember you by.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:35.232
- She is just a little girl.
She does not deserve this.

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:37.625
- We don't always get
what we deserve.

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:41.847
But you're going to, so start writing!
- OK, OK!

01:18:48.985 --> 01:18:51.639
"A rudderless ship, adrift

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:54.207
"at sea...

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.254
"Suffering the night...

01:18:58.995 --> 01:19:02.694
Alone, but free."

01:19:56.269 --> 01:19:58.706
Uh, yeah,

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.709
I need an ambulance to my home.

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:19.989
Collins.

01:20:20.032 --> 01:20:24.123
You got her on GPS?

01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:37.963
- Call Nina.
-: Calling Nina.

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:53.544
- Nina, if you get this,
take Megan and get out of there!

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:14.043
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:18.003
- Uh, Sarah told me to come and pick up Megan.
- She didn't tell me.

01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:20.223
- Well, I'm telling you
now, so...

01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:22.660
- I have to call her.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.728
- Hey.

01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:50.862
Hey there, sleepy head.
- Auntie Lee?

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:55.084
- Yeah. - What are you doing here?
- It's OK, come with me, OK?

01:21:55.127 --> 01:21:59.175
Come on. It's gonna be fine.
Come on.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:10.664
- Where are we going?
- Everything's gonna be fine.

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.232
- Mommy!

01:22:13.276 --> 01:22:17.149
- Let her go! - Stay back!
- It's OK, sweetie, I'm here.

01:22:17.193 --> 01:22:19.935
Lee! Please, Lee...

01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:23.373
This is over.
- I want Mommy!

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:26.028
- Your mommy was
the best friend I ever had.

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.682
My only friend, really.

01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:32.512
She was the only thing
keeping me from...

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:35.124
- Lee!
- Put the gun down right now! Slide it over here!

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:37.126
Put it down!

01:22:37.169 --> 01:22:39.955
Put it down right now!

01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:46.744
- Lee, listen. Listen to me.
- How could you do this to me?

01:22:46.787 --> 01:22:50.400
- What's wrong with Auntie Lee?
- She's OK.

01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:53.359
She's gonna be OK. She just
needs to get some help.

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:55.492
- Help? Help?

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:58.321
Who's gonna help me? You?

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:00.758
I trusted you,

01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.542
Sarah!

01:23:02.586 --> 01:23:04.980
I did things for you that
nobody else would've done!

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:06.807
I gave you
your life back!

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:09.114
I believed you when you said
that we were friends!

01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:11.116
- We were!
- No!

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.075
I thought you cared about me,

01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:16.078
but you don't.

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:19.255
You don't.

01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:26.305
Nobody does.

01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.525
Nobody ever did.

01:23:28.568 --> 01:23:30.831
- Lee...

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:34.531
please...

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.277
- Take care of her.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:48.066
- I've got you.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:51.287
I've got you.

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:02.950
- I just wanted
to thank everybody

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:05.823
for being here tonight to help
us celebrate the release

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:10.349
of Sarah Miles' new collection
of poetry, entitled After.

01:24:10.393 --> 01:24:13.700
Sarah has graciously
agreed to read

01:24:13.744 --> 01:24:16.747
a couple of her
favorite pieces for us.

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:18.531
Sarah?

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:21.621
Thank you, Will.

01:24:23.884 --> 01:24:27.975
These past few months
have been difficult,

01:24:28.019 --> 01:24:32.458
and I don't know where I would
be if it wasn't for Will.

01:24:32.502 --> 01:24:36.854
He's been such
a good friend.

01:24:38.682 --> 01:24:41.554
I would also like to thank
my daughter, Megan.

01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:44.427
This book is
dedicated to her.

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.820
The first piece

01:24:46.864 --> 01:24:50.302
that I'm going to be reading
is titled Uncharted.

01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:56.917
"Alone in the void
you left behind,

01:24:56.961 --> 01:25:00.138
"no refuge from
the storm of time.

01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:04.490
"A rudderless ship, adrift
at sea, suffering the night.

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:07.885
"Alone, but free.

01:25:07.928 --> 01:25:12.368
"No stars to guide,
no wind to flee.

01:25:12.411 --> 01:25:16.372
"Just the promise
of dawn, for her

01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:20.941
and for me."
