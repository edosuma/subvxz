00:34.668 --> 00:36.237
Thank you.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.346
Man: Mr. Fitzgerald,
I'm your very biggest fan
America has.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.548
It's such an exciting voice
you have.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.417
I read it from cover to cover.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.619
Greatest book I've read in ages.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.053
A masterpiece.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.788
It's as if you're writing
about me.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.690
Oh.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.393
- No empty glasses
- [tapping on glass]

00:59.460 --> 01:02.029
No empty glasses.
This is from my personal stock.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.234
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Harold Ober.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.303
The greatest literary agent
an an author could ask for.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.573
It's easy when you represent
such remarkable authors.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.676
And on the subject
of remarkable,

01:15.743 --> 01:18.145
it's quite something
when a novel sells its way

01:18.146 --> 01:20.314
through a 5,000-copy printing.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.316
Now meet the wonder boy
of the year,

01:22.383 --> 01:24.285
Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald,

01:24.352 --> 01:27.588
who has sold his way through
a whopping 20,000 copies

01:27.655 --> 01:29.223
in two weeks.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.491
- Man: Bravo.
- [applause]

01:30.558 --> 01:32.426
[crowd clamoring]

01:32.493 --> 01:36.530
From H.L. Mencken,
who, as is to be expected,

01:36.597 --> 01:38.232
says it better
than the rest of us,

01:38.299 --> 01:40.734
"Just read 'Paradise.'
Stop.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.071
"Then best American novel
I've seen of late.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.406
"Stop.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.476
"I pity the next book I pick up.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.178
End. Stop."

01:50.211 --> 01:53.181
It's a rare author that
debuts to universal praise.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.782
- Man: Bravo!
- Nearly universal.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.452
Now, now, no more
about Heywood Broun.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.521
Nobody reads
the "Tribune" anyway.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.291
- [applause]
- Ober: To Scott Fitzgerald.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.758
To all of you

02:04.825 --> 02:07.795
for your infinite good taste.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.631
- All: Cheers!
- Man: Well done!

02:10.698 --> 02:14.368
Scott, there's someone
I want you to meet.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.704
You know Jerry, this is nephew,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.872
went to Princeton, class of '16?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.609
Oh, of course...
[continues indistinct]

02:23.211 --> 02:26.547
Dutch!

02:26.614 --> 02:30.117
- Quite the occasion.
- Oh, isn't it?

02:30.218 --> 02:33.221
I'm so happy for Scott,
I'm grinning like a possum.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.623
Look at you, Zelda.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.559
You certainly know how
to stand out in a room.
Don't you think, sister?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.894
Nothing makes me homesick
like a well placed ruffle.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.265
We're having tea at
the Ritz tomorrow, darling.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.433
- Do say you'll come.
- Oh.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.236
- Vincent!
- Man: Miss Millay!

02:49.437 --> 02:53.274
Edna St. Vincent Millay,
the poet.

02:53.341 --> 02:57.378
Hello, darling.
Who is this?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.647
Zelda Fitzgerald.
How do you do?

02:59.713 --> 03:04.117
- The wife.
- That's right. Mrs. Fitzgerald.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.254
Vincent Millay.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.156
I thought there was an Edna
or Saint in there someplace.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.824
Oh, I've never been
much of an Edna.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.493
And no one
would call me a saint.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.795
Well, I've read all your poetry.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.431
I'm sure I'm one
of your biggest fans.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.633
"My candle burns at both ends;

03:19.700 --> 03:21.268
"It will not last the night;

03:21.269 --> 03:23.170
"But ah, my foes,
and oh, my friends...

03:23.271 --> 03:24.872
It gives a lovely light!"

03:24.938 --> 03:26.640
Oh, it's just gorgeous.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.143
How lovely,
you memorized all four lines.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.450
Well, I've always wanted
to meet you,

03:36.517 --> 03:38.286
and now I certainly have.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.192
Oh, I don't know what
she thought would happen,

03:45.293 --> 03:48.596
waltzing around the Algonquin
in that fucking frock.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.798
- Girl reeks of antebellum.
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.411 --> 04:08.482
- Zelda, there you are.
- Here I am.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.917
I need more time with you.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.319
We are going to have to make
a date to go shopping.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.387
Oh.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.489
That way I get you
all to myself.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.358
Yes. Let's do that.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.900
The Bankheads lost
their accents.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.337
You'd never know
they were from Montgomery.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.973
- Tallulah's an actress.
- Oh, is she, darling?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.241
[chuckles]

04:34.342 --> 04:36.644
I love your drawl, darling girl.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.412
Don't you ever lose it.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.514
Lose it?
I wouldn't know how.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.720
You are a genuine marvel.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.825
Someone should kiss you.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.361
Someone should.

05:01.769 --> 05:05.506
The priority, my dear boy,
is your next novel.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.808
The entire country
is waiting to see

05:07.875 --> 05:10.210
what F. Scott Fitzgerald
will think of next.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.379
Absolutely.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.246
You're a fine artist,
Fitzgerald.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.748
The literary world awaits.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.551
However,
the Biltmore also awaits.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.687
Payment for a certain room?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.388
1815?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.824
So perhaps a story for, say,

05:23.891 --> 05:26.727
"Collier's" or "McCall's."

05:26.794 --> 05:29.763
Every magazine is clamoring
for your next short story.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.264
It's your bread and butter.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.667
[laughs]
Who's bread and butter?

05:33.734 --> 05:36.604
Submit a story that
they've already rejected.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.007
See if the name Fitzgerald
means something to them now.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.709
And as to the advance,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.777
you realize that
it's meetings like this

05:43.844 --> 05:46.414
that take up
all my writing time.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.249
Well, let's not worry, shall we?

05:49.316 --> 05:53.286
The book reading today
will benefit all of us.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.655
What book reading.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.290
At the National Arts Club.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.793
I didn't agree to that, did I?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.429
As I recall, a couple Martinis,

06:01.462 --> 06:02.939
and you thought
it was a marvelous idea.

06:02.963 --> 06:06.434
You can't take
my drunken word for it.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.568
What else have we?

06:07.635 --> 06:10.571
It'll be grand.
Fans, critics.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.872
H.L. Mencken.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.775
Burton Rascoe.
Heywood Broun.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.544
But Broun hates me.

06:16.610 --> 06:20.447
Only until he hears you read.

would like to try on,

06:29.623 --> 06:30.724
we're at your service.

Zelda?

06:32.325 --> 06:33.994
No, no.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.730
Now, this.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.535
What do you think?

06:41.602 --> 06:44.938
Now, Zelda, where would you
wear at thing like that?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.874
Well, that's the fun.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.242
you put the gown on,
and then you're practically
obligated

06:49.309 --> 06:51.478
to find an occasion worthy
of the thing.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.580
Shall I try it on?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.482
If you'd like.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.651
I'm just afraid
that a dress like that

06:57.718 --> 06:59.019
would end up wearing you.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.723
But I would love to see you
in a number like this.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.494
Oh, I don't know.

07:06.527 --> 07:10.097
A Jean Patou suit makes
you look like you were
born in the city.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.733
Of course, it's up to you, dear.
Try it on.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.605
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.040
- Shall I come with you?
- Please do.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.508
Thank you.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.545
Your dear husband is
just going to lose his mind

07:24.612 --> 07:26.747
when he sees you
in your new suit.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.916
- Ladies?
- Waldorf salad, thank you.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.552
Could the kitchen make me
some tomato finger sandwiches?

07:31.619 --> 07:33.521
- Of course.
- Thank you.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.188
Well, what's the point
of a dress

07:35.255 --> 07:37.858
if it doesn't send a man
straight to the asylum?

07:37.925 --> 07:41.361
God bless Scott for knowing
something clothing.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.764
I swear,
I could wear a burlap sack

07:43.831 --> 07:46.099
and Harold wouldn't even blink.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.935
When did you and Scott
talk about fashion?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.137
Last night at the party.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.541
Scott told me
that you came to town

07:53.607 --> 07:56.109
with a trunk full of clothes
from Montgomery, that's all.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.713
And when he suggested
that you might want
to pick up a few new things,

07:59.780 --> 08:03.116
I jumped at the chance
to take you on your
first trip to Ladies Mile.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.885
How sweet of you.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.787
Not half as sweet as Scott.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.990
You should have heard him go on
about what styles would suit
you best.

08:10.057 --> 08:15.596
He must have said a dozen times
the suit had to be a Jen Patou.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.631
If you asked Harold,
"What's a Patou?"

08:17.698 --> 08:19.132
He'd probably say,
"Gesundheit."

08:23.403 --> 08:25.639
He's just gonna die
when he sees you.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.480
What about the part where Amory
is trying time kiss Eleanor

08:33.581 --> 08:34.748
and he calls her stupid?

08:34.815 --> 08:37.650
Am I the muse?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.385
It's a favorite of mine as well.

08:39.452 --> 08:43.256
It's possibly too callow
for this crowd.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.794
You. Callow.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.696
Immature perhaps.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.599
This... This crowd
will be filled with

08:51.632 --> 08:53.233
high-brow literati.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.468
I have to choose
the perfect passage.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.505
I'll ask Zelda.
She'll know.

08:58.606 --> 09:02.009
Darling girl, I need your help.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.178
Is that so?
I thought it was
the other way around.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.614
What does that mean?

09:06.647 --> 09:09.516
I suppose there's some reason
you sent that woman

09:09.617 --> 09:11.518
to pick out my clothes
like I was a child,

09:11.619 --> 09:13.954
but I can't for the life
of me imagine what it is.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.256
I was trying to help.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.159
I just wanted to make you feel
that you belonged here.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.095
The women in this city,
they have a uniform.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.064
I don't care
what the women wear.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.075
And I have no idea
why you're so worried about it.

09:26.099 --> 09:30.804
Zelda, I love you.
I just want people to see you
the way that I see you.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.140
No one can see you
under a thousand ruffles.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.843
I like ruffles.
And how is this dress
any different

09:35.909 --> 09:37.220
than the ones I wore
in Montgomery

09:37.244 --> 09:39.004
when you were telling me
how beautiful I was?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.781
We're not in Montgomery
any more.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.950
I'm well aware.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.221
Zelda, this is our time to soar!

09:48.288 --> 09:50.223
We need to put
our best foot forward.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.893
You were at the party.
You saw how they were dressed.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.528
- We need to ma...
- That Heywood Broun
is right about you.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.966
You're just as phony
and juvenile and pretentious
as they say.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.068
I know you don't mean that.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.703
Oh, I mean it.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.638
I mean it with all my heart.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.141
You're ashamed of me,
Scott Fitzgerald?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.177
Well, I'm ashamed of you.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.245
I thought I married a man.

10:12.312 --> 10:16.049
And here I am standing
in front of an insecure
little boy.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.830
[sighs]

10:33.200 --> 10:35.969
Darling, can we just talk?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.874
I'm about to leave
for the Arts Club.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.110
This is my first reading.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.745
You have to come.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.715
I need you there with me.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.119
I don't care what you wear.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.255
You're always the most
beautiful woman in the room.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.757
Please?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.261
[pounds on door]

11:01.328 --> 11:02.730
I was trying to help.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.369
[door opens, closes]

11:13.006 --> 11:14.307
There you are.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.644
I can't do this.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.379
- Of course you can.
- No.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.281
Harold, I really can't.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.984
You can, Scott, and you will.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.320
Look over my shoulder.
There. To the left.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.325
Henry? Might we borrow you?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.763
My dear Fitzgerald,
it's a pleasure.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
Mr. Mencken,
the pleasure is all mine.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.102
I've read nearly every piece
that you've ever published.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.171
I'm honored to...
to have been included.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.906
The honor's all mine.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.909
It's not every day we find
the fresh voice of a new
generation.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.053
Hell of a book, Fitzgerald.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.678
Hell of a book!

11:51.779 --> 11:55.315
Zelda: I'd always believed
I was a woman of adventure.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.017
someone ready to experiment

11:57.084 --> 12:00.220
and experience
all life could offer.

12:00.287 --> 12:04.091
But it seems after all,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.393
I may be nothing but
an impediment

12:06.459 --> 12:08.028
to the man I love.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.667
Fitzgerald,
have you met Heywood Broun?

12:14.802 --> 12:17.905
- We should probably move along.
- Oh, but we've only just met.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.407
Mr. Broun.
It's a pleasure.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.275
I read the "Tribune," of course.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.145
And I read your little
debut novel, of course

12:25.212 --> 12:27.456
It was quite an interesting,
let's see, what did I call it?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.491
We all know what
you called it, Heywood.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.884
and we all know you were wrong.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.153
But then, you're
so often wrong...

12:33.220 --> 12:35.488
so difficult to take
your words seriously.

12:35.555 --> 12:39.827
Thankfully people read
the paper for other reasons.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.034
Door was open.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.735
You're missing the reading.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.370
And so are you.

12:50.437 --> 12:55.108
There'll be others.
Drink?

13:12.525 --> 13:14.862
[clears throat]

13:28.876 --> 13:31.945
"Youth is like having
a big plate of candy."

13:34.714 --> 13:37.017
"Sentimentalists...
[clears throat]

13:37.084 --> 13:40.888
"...think that they want to be
in the pure, simple state

13:40.954 --> 13:43.924
"they were in...

13:43.991 --> 13:45.292
before they"...

13:54.935 --> 13:56.769
Uh...

13:56.904 --> 13:58.504
"They were in before
they ate the candy."

14:00.573 --> 14:02.418
- "They don't"...
- Man: Could you speak up lease?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.244
Pardon me? What was that?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.313
We can't hear you in the back.

14:09.416 --> 14:13.353
[clears throat]
I think it might be best if I

14:13.420 --> 14:15.155
started from the beginning.

14:16.423 --> 14:20.160
"Youth is like having
a big plate of candy."

14:20.227 --> 14:22.529
"Sentimentalists think
they want to be

14:22.595 --> 14:26.934
in the pure, simple state
they were in before they
ate the candy."

14:27.000 --> 14:29.602
I still think it was
a cowardly thing to do,

14:29.669 --> 14:32.272
If he didn't like
the way I dressed,
he could have told me.

14:32.339 --> 14:36.409
And how would that
have gone exactly?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.478
Couldn't have gone worse.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.048
Give me that bottle.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.083
Zelda, you're not like
his other women.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.985
You're a challenge.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.489
You're smart
and witty and fearless.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.959
He might not always know
how to deal with that.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.493
He'd better learn.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.363
He basically married
the heroine of his stories.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.303
This city doesn't make
a lick of sense to me.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.274
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.142
No one does.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.982
Somewhere to be?

15:15.048 --> 15:19.319
The Bankheads invited me
to tea at the Ritz
and I accepted,

15:19.386 --> 15:22.155
although I can't,
for the life of me,
think why.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.992
Because one says "no"
to the Bankheads.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.661
- I don't want to go.
- Then don't.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.898
If I don't go, they'll think
I can't keep up.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.066
I have to go.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.575
What?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.012
I don't have anything
to wear, Luddy.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.546
Just these Montgomery dresses

15:46.613 --> 15:49.482
and that godforsaken suit.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.522
If you wore this...

15:59.026 --> 16:02.895
you'd be the snazziest bird
at the Ritz.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.034
I wouldn't worry too much.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.237
I know you're an author,
not an actor.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.539
Good God, Ober,
is that the best you got.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.807
In this case, yes.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.377
It will no doubt
be immortalized by...

16:19.046 --> 16:21.581
There's the little prick now.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.217
Goddamn bottom feeder.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.054
Fitzgerald,
I don't think this is the time.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.591
Mr. Broun.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.127
I think I understand
why you became a critic.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.695
You understand everything,
I imagine.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.130
I can smell it on your breath.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.599
People like you don't have
to sweat and toil

16:39.666 --> 16:41.334
to create something
for the ages.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.969
Come on, Fitzgerald, let's go.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.604
Yes.
Why don't you run along?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.640
No. All you do is you sit
around and you wait

16:47.707 --> 16:50.743
for a man braver than yourself
to attempt greatness,

16:50.810 --> 16:52.545
and then you rip him to shreds.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.948
There's no need to take this to
a personal place Mr. Fitzgerald.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.717
I reviewed your book, not you.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.120
Lucky for you, I wrote one.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.390
'Cause without it,
all you'd do is sit around
and fiddle with your dick.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.455
Scott!

17:06.093 --> 17:08.295
I can see you're upset,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.729
I'll say adieu.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.998
I have written a great book.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.099
I am a great writer.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.435
A writer that people
will remember.

17:16.502 --> 17:20.140
And you know what they will
remember you for?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.273
Nothing.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.578
So off you go,
Mr. Heywood Broun.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.516
Off into the great abyss
of the forgotten.

17:29.582 --> 17:33.553
That's exactly why
I didn't like your writing.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.755
You have such a gift for cliché.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.624
Good afternoon.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.234
♫♫ [piano]

17:47.300 --> 17:48.335
Hello, madam.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.512
Hello.
I'm meeting the Bankheads.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.770
They're in the back.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.972
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.709
- Will you look at that?
- Gorgeous.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.212
Darling.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.147
I love your suit.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.249
Je l'aime bien!

18:07.620 --> 18:09.722
I'm shocked she got
out of bed this morning.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.158
I would have slept
till I was dead.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.504
What are you two going on about?

18:14.361 --> 18:18.765
Her man's got another girl.
Everyone knew. Now she does too.

18:18.831 --> 18:23.436
- Vincent, you showed.
- Sometimes I do.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.539
Oh, look at you in your Patou.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.741
- My darling.
- You heard.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.410
I imagine you have.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.313
- Well, of course, we hate her.
- We've always hated her.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.890
I'm sure there are women
who can wear lipstick and rouge

18:34.914 --> 18:36.183
without looking like a Jezebel,

18:36.216 --> 18:37.593
but Eleanor Boardman
is not one of them.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.185
Her hemlines don't help.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.164
The real crime is her hair.
Who let her cut it all off?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.655
She says she did it
to be "modern."

18:42.722 --> 18:44.824
I heard it was a nasty
case of ringworm.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.193
Tallulah:
She rarely bathes.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.870
Eugenia: Is that why
she's been wearing a turban?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.196
Vincent:
A happy accident.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.669
At least the turban
gives her a look.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.665
[chuckling]

18:54.467 --> 18:58.705
Mrs. Fitzgerald,
do you have a thought?

18:58.771 --> 19:01.508
Surely we have better things
to do than tear a woman

19:01.574 --> 19:03.075
to pieces over a matter
of fashion.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.312
Well, darling, it's not
like the lady is here.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.779
And it's not like
the lady's a lady.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.782
Maybe she is dreadful.
I don't know.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.385
I'm sorry she stole your beau,
Vincent.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.887
You seem terribly
broken up over it.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.727
If you'll excuse me,
I'm finding it hard to breathe.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.807
Miss! No! Your hair!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.276
What are you doing?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.514
Is there a barber in the hotel?

20:19.519 --> 20:20.787
Zelda?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.278
I haven't been married
in months.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.648
I feel like the whole thing's
over and done with.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.484
Marriage is a wonderful
institution, my boy.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.252
But as I always say,

20:53.320 --> 20:55.622
who wants to live
in an institution?

20:55.688 --> 20:58.958
That's the truth.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.893
It's all I speak.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.600
The trouble is, I do.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.705
I want to be in that institution
if she's there, too.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.442
That is a problem.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.510
Man: Yes, ma'am.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.946
Don't I know it.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.350
Zelda?

21:28.355 --> 21:29.689
Good God.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.991
[chuckles]

21:32.058 --> 21:36.363
You look incredible.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.001
I'm sorry that
I was so thoughtless.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.504
I tried the group out.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.806
I really did, but...

21:46.873 --> 21:49.008
I just can't be
like everybody else.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.412
Well, thank God.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.814
'Cause you are the only one
that I want.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.488
- Mr. Fitzgerald.
- [camera flash pops]

22:02.822 --> 22:04.557
Man:
Who's the lady?

22:04.624 --> 22:05.958
Man 2:
What's your name, honey?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.394
What's your name?

22:07.427 --> 22:11.063
Gentlemen, may I introduce...

22:11.130 --> 22:13.533
Mrs. Scott Fitzgerald?

22:14.601 --> 22:16.503
You can call me Zelda.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.005
- Zelda!
- Zelda!
- Right here!
