Ah, what a wonderful,
traditional Thanksgiving meal.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.395
The cranberry log.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.529
Yeah, cranberry.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.099
The yams with
marshmallows on top.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.400
The weird green bean dish

00:32.433 --> 00:34.502
that has almonds in it
for some reason.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.503
I have a condition.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.806
And most importantly,
this big beautiful bird.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.243
Man, oh, well.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.145
What's with you guys?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.280
Come on. It's Thanksgiving!

00:46.314 --> 00:48.516
Thanksgiving is the worst, bro.

00:48.549 --> 00:52.153
Thanksgiving, worst?

00:52.186 --> 00:53.654
Blasphemy!

00:53.687 --> 00:56.490
Literally, every other holiday
is better than Thanksgiving.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.658
It is true.

00:57.691 --> 01:01.195
Upon the Halloween one
don Johnson's the fun costumes.

01:01.229 --> 01:05.533
Upon the Easter, one searches
for the multi-colored ovoids.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.369
And on the Christmas,
you ain't be giving no thanks,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.738
you be getting them presents.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.474
Thanksgiving is just
the same food at the same table

01:13.507 --> 01:15.543
with the same people
getting into the same arguments

01:15.576 --> 01:16.377
about politics.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.246
And you should be
thankful for that.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.881
Those are all time-honored
Thanksgiving traditions.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.184
So we gots to do
all that nonsense

01:23.217 --> 01:24.652
just 'cause it's traditions?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.587
Yes, that's how traditions work!

01:26.620 --> 01:29.190
Are not the people
that you spend the holiday with

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
more important
than the traditions?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.660
Nope. Now let's celebrate.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.700
I have a lot to be thankful for,

01:39.733 --> 01:41.235
so I'll go first.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.771
I am thankful for

01:43.804 --> 01:45.839
my tight butt

01:45.873 --> 01:48.309
and toned abs.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.910
Gross.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.445
Who would like to go next?

01:51.479 --> 01:54.315
Ahem. I's got something
to be thankful for, bro.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.917
That's wonderful, Beast Boy.
Please, go ahead.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.852
From the bottoms of my heart,

01:58.886 --> 02:01.155
I am thankful for poop.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.757
You can't be thankful for poop!

02:03.791 --> 02:05.326
But I am!

02:05.359 --> 02:07.695
I'm thankful for all
the good poop in the world.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.297
♪ All that awesome poop in France ♪

02:09.330 --> 02:10.598
♪ Makes me wanna sing and dance ♪

02:10.631 --> 02:13.301
♪ All that poop in Italy
makes me feel all wiggly ♪

02:13.334 --> 02:14.635
♪ Russia, Egypt, Bangladesh ♪

02:14.668 --> 02:16.204
♪ All their poop is super fresh ♪

02:16.237 --> 02:17.438
♪ Guatemala, Liechtenstein ♪

02:17.471 --> 02:19.173
♪ I'm about to lose my mind ♪

02:19.207 --> 02:21.442
Argh! Sit down!

02:21.475 --> 02:23.944
Raven, what is something
you're thankful for?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.479
And it better not be poop.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.748
I'm thankful for having
a friend like you, Robin.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.583
Why thank you, Raven.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.286
I, I... Wait, was that sarcasm?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.354
Yes.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.289
Starfire, be thankful,

02:35.323 --> 02:36.590
and it can't be sarcastic

02:36.624 --> 02:37.725
or about poop!

02:37.758 --> 02:40.494
I am thankful that the Christmas
is only one month away.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.696
Terrible.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.831
Moving on.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.404
Look at this big
beautiful turkey.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.873
I am just so thankful right now.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.575
- So...
- Bored.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.643
Ooh...

02:55.676 --> 02:58.812
This glistening bird
doesn't excite your senses?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.648
Ew.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.484
Eating of the turkey bird
gives me the sleepies.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.353
Because turkeys
are loaded with...

03:06.920 --> 03:08.622
Which is basically turkey juice
that makes you fall asleep.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.328
So disgusting and so boring.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.663
Or we could spice things up

03:15.696 --> 03:17.598
and make this bad boy
into a turkducken.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.234
It has to be turkey!
That's the tradition.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.335
Oh, it's turkey, all right.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.836
A turkducken is a turkey...

03:22.870 --> 03:24.505
...stuffed with a duck...

03:24.538 --> 03:25.539
...stuffed with a chicken.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.907
Three birds in one, dude.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.409
Three birds!

03:28.442 --> 03:29.910
That is not a turkey,
it's an abomination!

03:29.943 --> 03:33.414
But are not the three birds
superior to the singular bird?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.016
No, it's an affront
to the holiday!

03:36.049 --> 03:37.585
Now everybody eat.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.859
Argh. I'm full.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.495
No, you're not.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.697
It's tradition to eat
until you can't eat any more,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.565
and then go back for seconds.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.568
Ah, but the stomachs
are at the capacity.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.404
Ah, did-a-did-a-da,
I don't wanna hear it.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.905
It's Thanksgiving!

03:57.938 --> 04:00.374
Eat until you regret everything
you've put into your body.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.659
Are you sure
that's a good idea, bro?

04:18.692 --> 04:19.727
Yes.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.995
Cyborg, why don't you share
a political opinion?

04:22.029 --> 04:24.798
Fine. I think the government
should do everything it can

04:24.832 --> 04:27.368
to make sure its people
are well cared for.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.541
You are
out of your mind, Cyborg!

04:33.574 --> 04:35.075
Out of your mind!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.410
You'd sell us all out

04:36.444 --> 04:37.911
to them fat cats
up in Washington!

04:37.945 --> 04:41.482
The obese cats
are not to be shamed,

04:41.515 --> 04:44.752
and I will fisticuff
anyone who disagrees.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.520
Power trip!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.766
Thanksgiving is exhausting.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.402
Maybe it's time
for a new holiday!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.103
With the new traditions.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.038
On traditional traditions.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.542
A holiday where we can be
as ungrateful as we want.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.811
The opposite of Thanksgiving!

05:12.613 --> 05:16.484
Whoa, Titans, you can't change
Thanksgiving traditions.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.352
Watch us. Come on, guys,

05:18.386 --> 05:20.521
we got some Thanksgetting to do.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.067
Pink cactuses, blinking lights,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.436
cat balloons!

05:35.469 --> 05:36.637
Where are the earth tones?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.572
There's no autumnal theme!

05:38.606 --> 05:40.708
Thanksgiving don't need
no autumnal theme.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.544
That's right. It's whatever
you want it to be, baby.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.112
Now what...
What are you wearing?

05:45.145 --> 05:48.549
Oh, that'll just be our
Thanksgetting costumes, fool.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.584
Holidays are more fun
with costumes.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.888
Now let us create the new
holiday traditions.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.162
I'll go first.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.598
I ain't thankful for paper cuts.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.900
Ow!

06:06.934 --> 06:09.503
Ow!

06:10.671 --> 06:12.740
I am not thankful for bees.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.575
That's right, I said it.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.445
You heard me.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.813
I'm not thankful for sunburns.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.881
See ya.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.552
Argh, this is wrong. All wrong!

06:24.585 --> 06:26.019
You've doomed us!

06:26.053 --> 06:30.424
And I am not the thankful
for Robin's stinky attitude!

06:32.460 --> 06:33.927
Pee-yew!

06:33.961 --> 06:37.498
You know we can't survive
without the sun, right?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.109
Phew, doggie,
look at this spread.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.612
I showed you
the carving of the pizza.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.981
Imma gonna go
with the marshmallow cereal,

06:54.014 --> 06:56.517
but Imma eat only
all the marshmallows.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.852
These dishes are inappropriate!

06:58.886 --> 07:01.188
Can we have some cranberries
from a can?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.956
No!

07:02.990 --> 07:04.592
Oh, Cranberry.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.767
This is the best part
of Thanksgetting day.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.868
The getting!

07:14.902 --> 07:16.737
Now let's open these babies up.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.039
Woo-hoo!

07:19.072 --> 07:21.108
An electric comb!

07:21.942 --> 07:23.744
Sick!

07:23.777 --> 07:26.514
Whoa, electric kicks!

07:26.547 --> 07:29.483
Huh, the electric
scratching post.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.553
Meow.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.154
Ho-ho, kale chips.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.256
That's actually
really thoughtful.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.625
Who should I thank?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.959
You ain't thanking no one, fool!

07:38.992 --> 07:41.729
That's the reason
for the season.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.732
Thanksgetting is
the greatest holiday ever.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.939
What's happening?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.709
I think we're about
to pay the price

07:55.743 --> 07:57.144
for breaking tradition.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.651
It's the Thanksgiving turkey.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.519
What's that fool doing here?

08:05.553 --> 08:07.688
I'm here for vengeance.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.526
You disrespected my traditions.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.662
You barely said thanks.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.530
And you made up your own

08:16.564 --> 08:18.532
holiday.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.738
Please, Thanksgiving Turkey,
forgive my friends.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.273
They didn't understand
the importance

08:26.306 --> 08:27.575
of the traditions.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.209
Because they're boring, yo.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.580
Of course they're boring,

08:32.613 --> 08:34.548
but you follow them anyway.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.085
Now prepare to feel

08:38.118 --> 08:42.656
the wrath
of Thanksgiving justice!

08:45.693 --> 08:47.227
Gross! What is that?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.863
I don't know, but I'm feeling...

08:50.297 --> 08:51.331
Drowsy.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.234
It is the tryptophan.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.604
And now...

08:57.805 --> 09:00.173
Time to stuff these birds.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.977
- Wait.
- You can't save them now.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.012
I realize that.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.814
But before you stuff them,

09:06.847 --> 09:09.016
I just need to say
one last thing.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.052
I think the president
is doing a great job.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.958
You are out of your mind.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.328
Hey, Turkey, stuff this!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.909
I'm an abomination.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.578
You are turkduck done.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.285
Enjoy your watery gravy.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.387
Whoa, that's pretty dark.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.695
Ha, well, I hope we all learned
some valuable lessons today.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.630
We sure did, friend Robin.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.932
Every time we don't listen to
you, you have to save the day

09:58.966 --> 10:00.734
with your big strong muscles.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.902
That's right, Star.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.671
And what about you, Cyborg?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.405
I learned
how important traditional meals

10:05.438 --> 10:06.674
are to the holidays.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.308
Booyah!

10:08.341 --> 10:09.943
And I'm not thankful
for poop anymore.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.045
I'm glad we're finally
on the same page.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.681
Sorry for doubting you, Robin.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.849
From now on, I'm just gonna
keep my big mouth shut.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.117
Ah, it warms my heart

10:17.150 --> 10:19.753
to have such wonderful
obedient friends

10:19.787 --> 10:21.922
to share
this magical holiday with.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.057
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
