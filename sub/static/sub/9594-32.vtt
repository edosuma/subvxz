00:30.664 --> 00:33.033
This ends today, H.I.V.E.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.138
Today justice will reign.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.672
Today evil will...

00:41.442 --> 00:45.713
Today evil will fall
to its knees. Today...

00:48.316 --> 00:50.451
Shh. He's looking.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.256
Today, hope for
the city's renew...

00:56.690 --> 00:57.625
Argh!

00:57.658 --> 01:01.095
Excuse us for a second,
please. Thank you.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.297
How many times
do I have to tell you
to not make fart noises

01:03.331 --> 01:06.234
when I am striking fear
into the hearts of the enemy.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.102
-Argh!

01:08.136 --> 01:10.438
This is supposed to be
the final showdown
and you're ruining it!

01:10.471 --> 01:12.373
Dude, why do you take
yourself so seriously?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.142
Yeah. Have a laugh
once in a while.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.377
We are the last line
of defense for this city,

01:16.410 --> 01:20.114
if we can't be serious about
being superheroes, then who?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.824
Look how serious they are.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.330
Ooh! They have
the eyes of righteousness.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.332
No one's even smiling.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.334
I feel so intimidated

01:40.368 --> 01:41.735
and I like it.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.539
Now those are real heroes.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.879
Send these cretins to our base
in the Kratoa nebula for
further interrogation.

01:51.912 --> 01:55.349
Something tells me
this is only the beginning.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.451
ROBIN: Hey there, Aqualad.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.520
Hello, Robin.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.788
Sweet moves out there!

02:00.821 --> 02:02.490
-I do what must be done.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.392
Now, uh, excuse me.

02:04.425 --> 02:09.230
There's an emergency
in the SN 1885 quadrant
that needs my attention.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.498
Cool, cool, cool.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.899
Yeah, I'll probably
head out there too.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.369
What? On your way
to a pie eating competition?

02:15.403 --> 02:16.637
What's that supposed to mean?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.507
-I love pie!

02:19.540 --> 02:21.275
When I say I want, you say...

02:21.309 --> 02:22.810
Not now!

02:22.843 --> 02:24.912
-I did not wish
to say anything.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.782
But you and your team have
brought nothing but shame
to all real superheroes.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.518
The Teen Titans
are a disgrace.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.853
Hey, hey, hey.
You are way off base, buddy.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.822
There's no difference
between our teams.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.624
We may do things
a little differently,

02:36.657 --> 02:38.526
but we're both just trying
to take down the bad guys.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.261
Is that right?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.663
Quick. Before they see us.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.165
Who is ready for another
of the girl's night out?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.804
Superheroes are supposed
to inspire hearts

02:50.838 --> 02:53.507
and teach valuable lessons
about friendship and life.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.676
We do that.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.512
What? Lessons like
books can be dangerous?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.948
Or what is better,
burgers or burritos?

03:00.981 --> 03:04.318
You are a mockery of
everything the world
holds sacred about heroes.

03:04.352 --> 03:07.755
Come on. What is so bad
about being a little silly
from time to time?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.590
I am all for a good laugh,

03:09.623 --> 03:12.693
but the Teen Titans
cannot be serious
for one single moment.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.894
-Good day.
-But...

03:13.927 --> 03:14.995
I said good day!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.997
Okay. Good talk, Aqualad.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.866
Yup. We'll catch up later.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.741
What's up with you, dude?

03:27.775 --> 03:29.577
Oh, nothing.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.712
Just thinking
about my dead parents.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.281
-So tragic.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.483
-Keep it light, dude.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.752
-Yeah, where did that
come from?
-I have the depression now.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.755
Sorry, I'm just brooding.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.824
Well, can you brood
in the kitchen, dude?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.959
And maybe bring me back
some pickles and tahini.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.661
No, I want to brood here!

03:47.695 --> 03:49.863
And it wouldn't be so bad
if you could too.

03:49.897 --> 03:54.468
Are you down in the dumpster
because the real heroes made
us look completely inadequate?

03:54.502 --> 03:56.404
We are real heroes!

03:56.437 --> 03:59.507
But we have forgotten that
because you've all become
real jokesters.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.741
Even Raven.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.776
What are you talking about?
I'm no jokester.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.546
Don't play dumb.
I've seen your act.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.748
Thanks for coming out.
Good to be here.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.450
Anyone from out of town?

04:09.483 --> 04:10.751
So my dad came to visit.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.320
You know what
that's like, right?

04:12.353 --> 04:14.522
Hi, honey.
Mind if I devour your soul?

04:14.555 --> 04:18.058
And I'm all like, "Can we
do that after breakfast?"

04:18.091 --> 04:21.028
The good thing about having
a demon as my father
is being immortal.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.531
The bad thing is having
to deal with him for
the rest of my life.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.036
He knows what
I'm talking about.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.872
Try all you want, Raven,
but you're not funny.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.940
None of you are!

04:34.041 --> 04:36.377
Admit it,
we're a little funny.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.546
Aren't you tired
of being two dimensional?

04:38.579 --> 04:39.780
There's so much more to us!

04:39.813 --> 04:41.048
I mean, look at Cyborg.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.484
He's half man
and half machine.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.653
I know! Pretty cool, right?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.788
No. It's not pretty cool.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.023
In fact it should
be tearing you apart.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.793
Are you a man
or are you a machine?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.928
-Whoa!
-That's heavy, dude.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.798
Could not being more serious
fracture the team?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.701
Yes, but that's how
we become stronger,

05:00.734 --> 05:03.637
by being torn apart
and coming back together.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.105
Preferably in front
of a sunset.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.074
I do not understand, Robin.

05:07.107 --> 05:10.511
Of course you don't,
because you're an alien
and that's your struggle.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.812
You should all be struggling.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.414
Maybe Robin's right.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.749
Aqualad and his friends
did look really cool.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.050
They sure did.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.487
And I want a tough face
and tight muscles.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.921
Of course you do!

05:20.954 --> 05:24.692
I have always wanted to visit
the SN 1885 quadrant.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.595
We can interrogate
some filthy cretins there
right now!

05:27.628 --> 05:31.565
I'd like to tell a villain,
"It's just you and me now."

05:31.599 --> 05:33.601
Then let's get...

05:34.568 --> 05:36.937
* It is time

05:36.970 --> 05:40.441
* To get really, really,
really serious

05:40.474 --> 05:41.809
* No time for toys

05:41.842 --> 05:42.910
* No time for food

05:42.943 --> 05:45.979
* There's no time
to be in a good mood

05:46.013 --> 05:49.082
* Serious eyes
and a serious nose

05:49.116 --> 05:52.119
* Serious faces
and a serious pose

05:52.152 --> 05:57.991
* It is time to say something
really, really serious *

05:58.025 --> 06:00.961
If you're not gonna help
then get out of the way!

06:00.994 --> 06:03.931
I work alone.
You'll only slow me down.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.067
I'm saying the one-liners
like a real hero.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.603
There is good
and there is evil

06:09.637 --> 06:12.372
and the line
between them is clear.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.656
Who among you would like
to sing a song about pie?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.624
How can I sing
when I am so conflicted?

06:30.658 --> 06:34.495
I have been so conflicted
and unhappy all this time
and never even knew it!

06:34.528 --> 06:37.431
I've never felt
more emotionally complex.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.533
We should have gotten serious
years ago.

06:39.567 --> 06:43.504
-Finally we are
no longer disgraces.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.607
We are the team I always
dreamed we could be.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.676
Look at how defined
my muscles are.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.611
Booyah!

06:50.644 --> 06:53.614
And I can't smile anymore.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.784
Crime alert!

06:56.817 --> 06:59.787
The President sends word the
H.I.V.E.'s murder satellite
is ready to launch.

06:59.820 --> 07:05.526
If we can't stop them
the world will be
destroyed forever!

07:05.559 --> 07:07.628
-Robin.
-Not now, Star.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.997
There's too much work to do.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.899
Titans go!

07:22.843 --> 07:24.945
STARFIRE:
What are we looking at, Robin?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.481
It is very... Dark.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.882
Of course it's dark.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.184
Night time is the most serious
time to fight crime.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.822
RAVEN: Yeah, but I can't see
anything either.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.824
ROBIN: Makes it
even more dangerous.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.892
I can use my cybernetics
to see.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.228
But what I did not
lose my humanity!

07:41.261 --> 07:45.633
STARFIRE: Robin, there is
something I need to tell you.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.835
Not now, we have a job to do.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.269
BEAST BOY:
In case we don't come back,

07:49.302 --> 07:52.239
I wanna say it's been an honor
serving with you all.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.475
ROBIN: Showtime!

07:57.210 --> 08:00.280
Everything is ready.
Missile is go for launch!

08:00.313 --> 08:02.015
ROBIN: Not on our watch.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.854
Titians! Whoa!
You guys look serious.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.857
We're done playing games
with you, H.I.V.E.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.192
Really? That's too bad.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.308
How do we stop it?

08:28.341 --> 08:31.178
With serious firepower!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.329
That is some serious
hero work, Titans.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.731
Aqualad.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.199
We came here
to clean up your mess,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.234
but it looks like you have
everything under control.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.004
Perhaps you can admit
you misjudged us.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.772
You do look
pretty serious now.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.642
I just worry,
is it too serious?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.176
Too serious?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.946
You don't understand
what it's like to be
half machine, half man.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.815
Let's get out of here, Titans.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.182
There's a life
and death emergency

09:09.216 --> 09:11.351
in the Mooka-Mooka
sector we have to deal with,

09:11.384 --> 09:16.023
and something tells me
this is only the beginning.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.964
Can you believe
Aqualad thought
we were too serious?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.599
Not now, Robin.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.636
I need to have a little talk
with my friend, Cyborg.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.903
What's this all about?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.338
You know what this is about.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.074
You drank my juice
and I wanna know why.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.976
-I was thirsty.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.046
You knew that was my juice!
My name was on the carton!

09:39.079 --> 09:41.114
So? It's drink,
it'll be dranken!

09:41.148 --> 09:43.350
If I can't trust you
with my juice

09:43.383 --> 09:45.919
then maybe
I can't trust you at all.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.154
Well, that makes two of us.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.356
Trust is a two-way street,
hombre.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.191
Hey, break it up.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.061
-It was just juice.
-Easy for you to say!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.663
It wasn't your juice!

09:55.696 --> 09:59.900
Guys, the monster in me
is feeding on your anger.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.202
I don't know who I am anymore!

10:02.235 --> 10:04.705
Snap out of it!

10:04.738 --> 10:06.073
You're Raven.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.309
Am I?
Or am I a monster, a freak?

10:09.342 --> 10:12.680
I don't think
I can be a part of this
team anymore!

10:15.148 --> 10:17.985
What is happening to our team?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.286
It's too late, Star.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.289
He knew what he was doing
when he drank the juice.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.256
My juice!

10:23.290 --> 10:25.659
And I enjoyed every sip of it!

10:25.693 --> 10:26.927
-No!

10:35.869 --> 10:40.207
ROBIN: Hmm. Could this
be the end of the Teen Titans?

10:40.240 --> 10:43.276
I thought being serious
would bring us closer

10:43.310 --> 10:46.179
but it's only driven us apart.
