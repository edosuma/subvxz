00:03.274 --> 00:11.290
*

00:32.398 --> 00:34.170
Tonight is the Dundies,

00:34.203 --> 00:37.143
the annual employee awards night
here at Dunder Mifflin.

00:37.176 --> 00:39.713
And this is everybody's
favorite day.

00:39.747 --> 00:41.883
Everybody looks forward to it.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.190
Because, you know,
a lot of the people here

00:44.223 --> 00:47.296
don't get trophies
very often.

00:47.328 --> 00:48.564
Like, Meredith or Kevin.

00:48.598 --> 00:49.867
I mean, who's gonna give
Kevin an award,

00:49.899 --> 00:51.137
Dunkin' Donuts?

00:51.171 --> 00:52.206
Plus, bonus,

00:52.239 --> 00:53.407
it's really, really funny.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.214
So I--You know, an employee
will go home,

00:56.247 --> 00:58.818
and he'll tell his neighbor,
"Hey, did you get an award?"

00:58.850 --> 01:01.156
And the neighbor'll say,
"No, man."

01:01.190 --> 01:03.427
I mean, I slave all day.
Nobody notices me.

01:03.461 --> 01:04.830
Next thing you know,

01:04.862 --> 01:06.667
employee smells
something terrible

01:06.701 --> 01:08.570
coming from
the neighbor's house.

01:08.605 --> 01:10.709
Neighbor's hanged himself.

01:10.741 --> 01:12.946
Due to lack of recognition.

01:12.979 --> 01:14.617
So...

01:14.650 --> 01:17.456
So you ready for
the Dundies?

01:17.488 --> 01:18.624
Ugh.

01:18.658 --> 01:20.262
You know what they say
about a car wreck,

01:20.294 --> 01:22.899
where it's so awful,
you can't look away?

01:22.932 --> 01:25.705
The Dundies are like
a car wreck that,

01:25.739 --> 01:26.873
you wanna look away,

01:26.907 --> 01:28.510
but you have to stare at it

01:28.545 --> 01:31.717
because your boss
is making you.

01:31.751 --> 01:32.886
Hey-hey-hey!

01:32.918 --> 01:34.790
It's Fat Halpert!

01:36.794 --> 01:37.995
What?

01:38.028 --> 01:39.400
Fat Halpert!

01:39.432 --> 01:41.337
Jim Halpert.

01:43.607 --> 01:45.479
So why don't I take
you on a tour

01:45.511 --> 01:47.383
of past Dundie winners?

01:47.416 --> 01:50.422
We got Fat Jim Halpert here.

01:50.454 --> 01:52.692
Jim, why don't you show off
your Dundies to the camera?

01:52.726 --> 01:54.562
Oh, I can't
because I keep them hidden.

01:54.596 --> 01:56.966
I don't wanna look at them
and get cocky.

01:57.001 --> 01:58.271
Oh!
That's a good idea.

01:58.305 --> 01:59.340
Mine are at home,

01:59.373 --> 02:01.411
in a display case
above my bed.

02:01.443 --> 02:03.914
Yeeaacck! TMI.
TMI, my friends.

02:03.948 --> 02:04.982
TMI?

02:05.017 --> 02:06.486
Too Much Information.

02:06.521 --> 02:09.392
Uh, it's just easier
to say TMI.

02:09.426 --> 02:11.731
I used to say "Don't go there,"
but that's lame.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.068
And here we have
Stanley the Manley.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.871
Now, Stanley is
a Dundie all-star.

02:15.904 --> 02:16.941
Aren't you, Stanley?

02:16.973 --> 02:19.313
Why don't you, uh,
show them some of your bling.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.481
I don't know where they are.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.683
I think I threw
them out.

02:21.716 --> 02:23.321
Oh, no, you di-in't.

02:23.355 --> 02:25.724
Uh, think I did.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.094
Mm--Why did--

02:27.126 --> 02:30.402
Say, we gotta order some more
appe-teasers this time

02:30.434 --> 02:31.904
We ran out last year,
remember?

02:31.936 --> 02:33.341
Yes, we should.
I

02:33.375 --> 02:35.945
I wanted one of those
skillets of cheese.

02:35.979 --> 02:37.615
But when I got off stage,

02:37.648 --> 02:42.459
someone had eaten
all of them.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.463
To Oscar Martinez,

02:44.497 --> 02:47.034
it's the
Show Me the Money award.

02:47.066 --> 02:50.609
Michael has taped
every Dundies Awards.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.979
And now he's making me
look through

02:53.013 --> 02:55.985
hours of footage
to find highlights.

02:56.019 --> 02:58.123
For the ladies.
Hit it, Dwight.

03:00.361 --> 03:04.937
* A little bit of Pam
all night long *

03:04.969 --> 03:08.009
* A little bit of Angela
on the thing *

03:08.042 --> 03:09.680
Oh, yeah.

03:09.713 --> 03:11.081
This is the part
where Kevin sat

03:11.115 --> 03:13.085
in front of the camcorder
all night.

03:13.119 --> 03:14.222
It's great.

03:14.256 --> 03:16.192
* A little bit of Roy
eating chicken crispers *

03:16.226 --> 03:19.065
* A little bit of Tim
with some ribs *

03:19.097 --> 03:21.135
* A little bit of Matt--

03:21.168 --> 03:22.573
It was you.

03:22.605 --> 03:23.674
It wasn't.
I swear.

03:23.708 --> 03:24.742
Yeah, it was.

03:24.777 --> 03:25.779
So what's the joke?

03:25.811 --> 03:27.081
You're not perfect either.

03:27.113 --> 03:29.453
We're not laughing
at you, Dwight.

03:29.487 --> 03:30.688
So who are we
laughing at?

03:30.722 --> 03:32.825
Um, just something
somebody wrote.

03:32.858 --> 03:34.563
Who

03:34.597 --> 03:36.065
No, no.

03:36.099 --> 03:38.904
Just something that was written
on the ladies room wall.

03:38.938 --> 03:40.172
What is it?
Who wrote it?

03:40.207 --> 03:41.977
Um, it's kind of private.

03:42.011 --> 03:43.680
It's about Michael.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.786
That is defacement
of company property.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.056
So you'd better tell me.

03:48.089 --> 03:51.162
Kelly, if you tell me,
you'll be punished less.

03:51.194 --> 03:54.101
Okay, now I'm laughing
at you.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.045
Will her highness
Jan Levinson-Gould

03:59.078 --> 04:02.719
be descending from her corporate
throne this evening

04:02.752 --> 04:06.091
to visit us lowly serfs
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?

04:06.125 --> 04:09.800
It's a two-and-a-half-hour
drive from New York, Michael.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.168
Well, you could take the bus.

04:11.201 --> 04:12.739
You could work
on the way here,

04:12.772 --> 04:13.908
sleep on the way home.

04:13.940 --> 04:14.942
No.

04:14.977 --> 04:16.814
Come on, Jan.
This is important.

04:16.846 --> 04:18.751
I mean, this is,
this is validation

04:18.784 --> 04:20.120
to my employees here

04:20.152 --> 04:22.191
that you and corporate
approve of this.

04:22.223 --> 04:24.195
Well, we don't
approve of this, Michael.

04:24.227 --> 04:26.199
W--
I mean, you only have
the budget

04:26.231 --> 04:28.571
for one office party
a year, so...

04:28.605 --> 04:30.941
we're not paying for this.

04:30.974 --> 04:34.048
Um--

04:34.081 --> 04:35.050
Can you

04:35.083 --> 04:37.121
Are you there, Michael?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

04:37.154 --> 04:38.223
I just wanted to, uh...

04:38.256 --> 04:40.227
talk to you for
a second about that.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.865
Um, what, uh, what is--

04:42.898 --> 04:45.237
I mean, come on!
Jan.

04:45.270 --> 04:47.307
What's--You're droppin'
an A-bomb on me here.

04:47.342 --> 04:49.780
Really? I'm dropping
an atomic bomb on you?

04:49.812 --> 04:51.115
Well, yeah.
I mean, what is--

04:51.149 --> 04:52.251
Right.

04:52.284 --> 04:54.822
You already had a party
on May 5th for no reason.

04:54.857 --> 04:58.096
No reason!
It was the 05-05-05 party.

04:58.129 --> 04:59.331
It happens once
every billion years.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.601
And you had a luau.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.706
And the tsunami relief
fundraiser,

05:02.739 --> 05:04.408
which somehow
lost a lot of money.

05:04.442 --> 05:06.846
Okay, no, that was
a fun raiser.

05:06.881 --> 05:09.150
I think I made that
very clear in the flyers.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.187
Fun, F-U-N.

05:10.219 --> 05:11.254
Okay, well, I don't
understand why anyone

05:11.288 --> 05:12.993
would have a tsunami
fun raiser, Michael.

05:13.026 --> 05:14.160
Well, I think
a lot of people

05:14.195 --> 05:16.264
were very affected
by the footage.

05:16.298 --> 05:19.873
It's a little character
I like to do.

05:19.906 --> 05:23.213
It is, uh,
loosely based on Carnac,

05:23.246 --> 05:25.918
one of Carson's
classic characters.

05:25.952 --> 05:28.790
Here we go.

05:28.825 --> 05:30.360
The PLO, the IRA,

05:30.394 --> 05:34.235
and the hot dog stand
behind the warehouse.

05:39.211 --> 05:42.050
Name three businesses that have
better heath-care plans

05:42.083 --> 05:45.759
than Dunder Mifflin.

05:45.792 --> 05:48.263
Here's the problem.

05:48.296 --> 05:50.934
There's no open bar
because of Jan.

05:50.969 --> 05:53.306
And it's the reason why

05:53.339 --> 05:57.281
comedy clubs have
a two-drink minimum.

05:57.314 --> 06:00.488
I mean, it'll be fine,
I just...

06:00.520 --> 06:04.061
wish people were gonna be drunk.

06:14.215 --> 06:15.985
Dwight, get out of here.

06:16.018 --> 06:18.155
What are you doing
in the ladies room?
It's not what you--

06:18.188 --> 06:19.391
No! Why were you in there?

06:19.426 --> 06:22.096
What were you doing in there?
I am not.
You are in there--

06:22.131 --> 06:26.372
The Dundie award
for longest engagement

06:26.405 --> 06:29.177
goes to Pam Beesley.

06:29.210 --> 06:32.050
Pam, everybody!
Yoo!

06:32.084 --> 06:34.055
When is that girl
gonna get married?

06:34.087 --> 06:36.091
That's what I have to say.
Aha, Roy's accepting.

06:36.124 --> 06:37.863
Thank you, Roy, are there
any words you'd like to say

06:37.896 --> 06:39.900
on Pam's behalf?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.302
Uh, we'll see you next year.

06:41.335 --> 06:45.276
Yeah! Oh, hope not!
Hope not.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.014
I'm not changing that.
That's the best one.

06:47.046 --> 06:48.584
No, it's hilarious.
You're right.

06:48.616 --> 06:52.492
I just think, um,
World's Longest Engagement,

06:52.525 --> 06:54.260
um, we're all expecting it,
you know?

06:54.294 --> 06:55.932
That's why it's funny.

06:55.965 --> 06:58.268
Every year that Roy and Pam
don't get married

06:58.302 --> 06:59.638
it gets funnier.

06:59.671 --> 07:00.841
Well, I think if you use
the same jokes,

07:00.841 --> 07:03.278
it just comes across as lazy.

07:03.313 --> 07:08.288
Oh. Lazy.
Uh-huh.

07:08.322 --> 07:09.525
Excuse me, everyone.

07:09.558 --> 07:12.296
Can I have your attention,
please?

07:12.331 --> 07:14.101
I just wanted to say

07:14.134 --> 07:16.304
that the women in this office
are terrible.

07:16.339 --> 07:17.608
Especially the ones

07:17.641 --> 07:19.277
who wrote that stuff
about Michael

07:19.310 --> 07:20.949
on the bathroom wall.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.651
Having a bathroom
is a privilege.

07:22.685 --> 07:25.289
It is called a ladies' room
for a reason.

07:25.322 --> 07:28.063
And if you cannot behave
like ladies,

07:28.095 --> 07:31.234
well then, you are not
going to have a bathroom.

07:31.269 --> 07:33.138
You're taking away
our bathroom?

07:33.173 --> 07:36.045
We are going to have
two men's rooms.

07:36.079 --> 07:37.447
But where would we

07:37.482 --> 07:39.718
Be prepared to hold it, folks.
Okay, okay.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.221
From 9:00 a.m.--
Look.

07:41.254 --> 07:42.558
Michael...
Yes?

07:42.592 --> 07:44.227
Dwight's banning us
from our bathroom.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.164
Okay, well, that's ridiculous.
So just don't--

07:46.199 --> 07:47.333
I don't have time
for this right now.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.508
There needs to be repercussions
for people's behavior.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.614
Stop it! Stop it!
Okay.

07:53.647 --> 07:56.119
Look, I know there have been
a lot of rumors flying around

07:56.152 --> 07:57.687
about the Dundies this year.

07:57.722 --> 08:00.728
How there is no money,
and how there is no food,

08:00.760 --> 08:04.367
and how the jokes
are really bad.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.641
But, what the hell, everybody?
I mean--

08:07.675 --> 08:13.486
God, the Dundies are about
the best in every one of us.

08:13.519 --> 08:17.326
Can't you see that?
I mean--

08:17.361 --> 08:20.266
Okay, we can do better.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.272
So tonight,
for the first time,

08:23.306 --> 08:26.278
we are inviting all of your
friends and family

08:26.312 --> 08:28.617
to attend the awards
with us.

08:28.649 --> 08:29.819
Yes.

08:29.851 --> 08:32.391
Yeah, not bad, right?

08:32.423 --> 08:34.529
So let's make this
the best Dundies ever.

08:34.562 --> 08:36.600
Best Dundies ever.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.119
Welcome to the eighth annual
Dundies awards.

08:46.152 --> 08:48.724
Before we get started,
a few announcements.

08:48.757 --> 08:50.761
Keep your acceptance
speeches short.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.698
I have wrap-it-up music,

08:52.732 --> 08:57.174
and I'm not afraid
to use it, Devon.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.186
* Drop a load on 'em

09:03.219 --> 09:05.157
*

09:05.189 --> 09:06.524
* The Dundies

09:06.559 --> 09:08.129
* How can I explain it

09:08.163 --> 09:09.465
* Awards you and I created

09:09.498 --> 09:11.169
* I'm glad that
you all made it *

09:11.201 --> 09:13.473
* You never have to work
so I don't hear no noises *

09:13.506 --> 09:15.678
* You're just a name a number
and no one even says hello *

09:15.710 --> 09:18.216
Card!
Come on.

09:18.248 --> 09:21.289
The Dundies are kind of like
a kid's birthday party.

09:21.321 --> 09:25.529
And you go, and there's really
nothing for you to do there.

09:25.562 --> 09:28.169
But the kid's having
a really good time.

09:28.203 --> 09:30.307
So you're kind of there.

09:30.339 --> 09:32.244
That's--that's kind
of what it's like.

09:32.276 --> 09:34.215
* Down with our Dundie

09:34.248 --> 09:36.653
* Get down with our Dundie *

09:36.686 --> 09:38.623
The waitress tripped
on the cord.

09:38.657 --> 09:39.891
All right.
All right.

09:39.926 --> 09:41.629
Joke landed.
So we are here.

09:41.663 --> 09:45.970
Thank you all for coming
to the 2005 Dundie awards.

09:46.003 --> 09:49.544
I am your host,
Michael Scott.

09:49.577 --> 09:52.852
And I just wanna tell you,
please, please,

09:52.885 --> 09:54.756
do not drink and drive.

09:54.789 --> 09:57.294
Because you may hit a bump
and spill the drink.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.901
I'll just put these
on the group tab.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.907
Nope, actually,
this year, no group tab.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.711
We're gonna be doing
separate checks.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.885
You said we could bring
our families.

10:09.918 --> 10:14.295
I did, and why didn't you,
Stanley?

10:14.327 --> 10:16.899
I did, and my wife's
name is Teri.

10:16.932 --> 10:19.037
Well, I'm looking forward
to meeting Teri.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.441
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding, Michael.

10:22.644 --> 10:24.982
Oh, yeah.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.285
Shut it.

10:26.319 --> 10:27.453
Um, good.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.691
Speaking of relationships
of all--

10:29.725 --> 10:31.528
all waves, shapes,
and forms,

10:31.562 --> 10:34.301
um, I was out

10:34.335 --> 10:36.305
on a very, very hot date
last night

10:36.339 --> 10:37.942
with a girl
from H.R., Dwight.

10:37.975 --> 10:40.447
Really? We don't have any
girls from H.R.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.749
No, uh...

10:41.783 --> 10:43.553
F-for the sake
of the story.

10:43.585 --> 10:45.457
And things were getting
hot and heavy.

10:45.490 --> 10:46.692
Yeah?

10:46.725 --> 10:48.429
And I was about to take
her bra off,

10:48.463 --> 10:51.469
when she had me fill out
six hours worth of paperwork.

10:51.502 --> 10:52.671
Like an AIDS test?

10:52.704 --> 10:54.575
No.

10:54.607 --> 10:56.110
God.

10:56.143 --> 10:57.646
Ahem!

10:57.681 --> 11:00.118
All right, so let's get
this pahty stahted!

11:00.151 --> 11:01.321
Hey, let's go
to Poor Richard's.

11:01.321 --> 11:04.027
Yeah, let's
get out of here.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.062
Um...

11:05.095 --> 11:07.735
Guys, where are you going?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.739
Pam, show's
just getting started.

11:09.771 --> 11:11.441
Sorry.

11:14.180 --> 11:15.918
And now to celebrate...

11:15.950 --> 11:18.121
You staying?
Yeah.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.693
Gotta eat somewhere.

11:20.728 --> 11:24.736
The Busiest Beaver Award
goes to Phyllis Lapin!

11:24.768 --> 11:26.571
Yeah!

11:26.605 --> 11:30.413
Way to go, Phyllis.
Nice work. Per usual.

11:30.447 --> 11:33.553
This says Bushiest Beaver.
What?

11:33.586 --> 11:36.091
I told them busiest--
Idiots.
It's fine.

11:36.123 --> 11:37.527
We can fix it.
We'll fix it up.

11:37.561 --> 11:39.129
You don't have
to display that.

11:39.164 --> 11:41.101
Because that's what happens
every time!
He's a jackass!

11:41.133 --> 11:42.437
Every year.

11:42.471 --> 11:43.304
Come on, we're going
to Poor Richard's.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.677
No, I don't wanna go.
I don't want to!

11:45.710 --> 11:48.783
Pam, no.
If you would've asked me that,
then you would know.

11:48.816 --> 11:52.023
Herro, everybody!

11:52.056 --> 11:55.196
Hey...how are you?
I thought you left.

11:55.228 --> 11:57.200
Um, no, I just--
I decided to stay.

11:57.232 --> 11:59.169
Oh.
I'll just get a ride
home from Angela.

11:59.204 --> 12:03.712
I going to call
the next award!

12:03.746 --> 12:05.883
Oh, good, I'm just
in time for Ping.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.155
Oh, that would be where?

12:08.187 --> 12:12.263
Uh, me so horny, right?
You know what I'm talking about.

12:12.296 --> 12:15.168
Can I get a drink?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:17.040 --> 12:22.115
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

12:22.150 --> 12:26.091
Somebody who, I think,
a lot of us, cannot keep

12:26.123 --> 12:28.028
from checkin' out.

12:28.062 --> 12:32.671
The Hottest in the Office Award
goes to...

12:32.703 --> 12:34.975
Ryan the temp!

12:35.009 --> 12:37.013
Yeah!

12:37.046 --> 12:40.152
* Hey, ho,
you sexy thing *

12:40.186 --> 12:41.922
* Sexy thing you *

12:41.955 --> 12:43.092
Here you go.

12:45.597 --> 12:47.332
* Hangin' in
the huh nuh nuh ha *

12:47.365 --> 12:50.206
* Come from, baby *

12:50.239 --> 12:52.210
There you go.
There you go, whoo!

12:52.243 --> 12:54.915
What am I gonna do
with the award?

12:54.948 --> 12:58.188
Nothing.

12:58.222 --> 13:01.194
I--I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

13:01.228 --> 13:04.167
That's the least
of my concerns right now.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.075
And the Tight-Ass Award

13:08.108 --> 13:09.277
goes to Angela.

13:09.309 --> 13:12.616
Not only because she is
everybody's favorite stickler,

13:12.651 --> 13:15.789
but because she has
a great caboose.

13:15.824 --> 13:20.231
So, come on down.
No.

13:28.282 --> 13:30.720
I think those
might be empty.

13:30.752 --> 13:32.156
No, no, 'cause the ice melts,

13:32.190 --> 13:34.059
and then it's like,
second drink.

13:35.361 --> 13:38.202
Second drink?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.705
The Spicy Curry Award

13:39.738 --> 13:42.210
goes to our very own,
Kelly Capour.

13:42.243 --> 13:44.849
Get on up here.

13:44.881 --> 13:46.218
There you go.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.121
"Spicy Curry,"
what's that mean?

13:48.155 --> 13:50.292
Um, not everything means
something, it's just a joke.

13:50.326 --> 13:52.062
Yeah, but why'd you
give it to me?

13:52.095 --> 13:53.867
I don't know.
I just--

13:53.899 --> 13:55.236
This is a bowler.
I know.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.039
It's--they didn't have
any more businessmen.

13:57.072 --> 14:00.246
Yeah, but I don't--
Just sit down, Kelly.

14:03.017 --> 14:04.955
It's so freaking hot in there.

14:04.988 --> 14:06.391
Now I know what Bob Hope
was going through

14:06.423 --> 14:07.460
when he performed
in Saudi Arabia.

14:07.492 --> 14:09.064
Man!

14:09.097 --> 14:11.101
I got Dwight sucking
the funny out of the room.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.272
But, you know, you do
what you can do.

14:13.304 --> 14:15.910
Here we go,
he's early with the cue.

14:15.944 --> 14:17.280
Gotta go.

14:17.312 --> 14:22.256
* You have won a tiny Dundie

14:22.290 --> 14:24.761
Ow! Sing it, Elton!

14:24.795 --> 14:26.231
Hey, thanks guys.

14:26.264 --> 14:27.801
Hey, where're you guys from?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.337
We just came
from your mama's house.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.438
Are you guys gonna
finish that?

14:30.472 --> 14:32.110
Oh, right, yeah!

14:32.142 --> 14:34.113
Sing another song, Dude.

14:34.146 --> 14:35.548
Uh, you know what, guys?

14:35.581 --> 14:37.253
We're just having a little
office party.

14:37.286 --> 14:39.056
So if you wanna--
Hey!

14:39.089 --> 14:40.158
You know, cool it guys,
really.

14:40.191 --> 14:42.062
You suck, man.

14:42.095 --> 14:44.300
You suck.

14:49.344 --> 14:51.882
Let's cut it.

14:54.454 --> 14:57.293
I had a few more Dundies
to give out tonight.

14:57.326 --> 15:00.265
But I'm just gonna
cut it short.

15:00.299 --> 15:01.801
And wrap it up

15:01.801 --> 15:04.239
so everybody can
enjoy their food.

15:04.274 --> 15:09.017
Um, thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

15:09.049 --> 15:11.154
This last Dundie is for Kevin.

15:11.188 --> 15:13.591
This is the Don't Go In There
After Me award.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.231
It's for the time that I went
into the bathroom after him,

15:16.263 --> 15:19.570
and it was really,
really smelly.

15:23.244 --> 15:24.613
There you go.

15:30.325 --> 15:32.596
Yay, Kevin!

15:32.629 --> 15:35.369
Whoo hoo!
For Kevin!

15:35.402 --> 15:37.406
For stinking up
the bathroom!

15:37.440 --> 15:40.512
Yeah, all right, Kev!
Whoo!

15:40.546 --> 15:42.182
Hey, I haven't gotten one yet.

15:42.215 --> 15:44.487
Yes, I have not
gotten one either.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.458
So, keep going.
More Dundies!

15:46.491 --> 15:48.595
Dundie.
Dundie.
Dundie.
Dundie.

15:52.335 --> 15:53.939
All right, all right,
all right, okay.

15:53.974 --> 15:55.509
All right,
we'll keep it rolling.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.279
Okay, this is
the Fine Work Award.

15:57.312 --> 15:59.184
This goes to Stanley.

15:59.216 --> 16:01.320
For all the fine work
he did this year.

16:01.353 --> 16:03.492
You know you did.

16:03.525 --> 16:05.562
Hear, hear.

16:05.595 --> 16:08.268
Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...

16:08.302 --> 16:11.341
Well, the last year,
I got Great Work.

16:13.778 --> 16:16.150
So I don't know what
to think about this award.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.988
But, at least I didn't get

16:18.022 --> 16:19.690
Smelliest Bowel
Movement like Kevin.

16:24.267 --> 16:28.342
And this next award is going out
to our own little Pam Beesley.

16:28.374 --> 16:30.378
I think we all know
what award

16:30.411 --> 16:31.180
Pam is gonna be
getting this year.

16:31.214 --> 16:35.022
It is the Whitest
Sneakers Award.

16:35.056 --> 16:39.429
Because she always has
the whitest tennis shoes on!

16:39.463 --> 16:41.400
Get on down here!

16:41.433 --> 16:43.737
Pam Beesley,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:43.772 --> 16:46.544
Ooh, here we go.

16:46.578 --> 16:50.451
I have so many people to thank
for this award.

16:52.556 --> 16:54.127
Okay, first off, my Keds,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.531
because I couldn't have
done it without them.

16:56.564 --> 16:59.237
Thank you.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.739
Let's give Michael
a round of applause

17:00.771 --> 17:02.042
for emceeing tonight,

17:02.042 --> 17:05.581
because this is a lot harder
than it looks.

17:05.616 --> 17:08.521
And also because
of Dwight too.

17:08.555 --> 17:12.130
Um, so, finally,

17:12.162 --> 17:17.306
I wanna thank God
because God gave me this Dundie.

17:17.339 --> 17:22.450
And I feel God
in this Chili's tonight.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.486
Whoo!

17:24.519 --> 17:26.490
Pammy B.,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.328
Oh, thank you.

17:28.361 --> 17:30.766
Yeah!
Chair?

17:34.740 --> 17:37.213
Oh!

17:39.750 --> 17:43.225
What a great year
for the Dundies.

17:43.258 --> 17:44.227
We got to see Ping.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.233
And we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.534
Which was touching.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.208
And we heard Michael
change the lyrics

17:51.241 --> 17:52.676
to a number
of classic songs.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.448
Which for me,
has ruined them for life.

17:55.481 --> 17:58.322
[Michael singing
I've Had the Time of My Life]

17:58.355 --> 17:59.489
What?

17:59.523 --> 18:00.859
Nothing.

18:00.891 --> 18:02.162
Okay.

18:02.162 --> 18:06.438
What?
I don't know, what?

18:06.470 --> 18:08.308
Oh, my God.

18:08.341 --> 18:11.748
You are so drunk.
Did you get that?

18:11.780 --> 18:12.849
Please tell me that you got--

18:12.882 --> 18:15.221
Vince, Vince!
Woman has had a seizure!

18:15.256 --> 18:16.424
Grab her tongue!
Grab her tongue!

18:16.457 --> 18:17.760
It's okay,
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.764
Well, he's a volunteer.
Don't get into that now.

18:19.797 --> 18:21.568
We need something
to cushion her head.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.572
A throw pillow?
A cushion?

18:23.604 --> 18:24.874
Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt.

18:24.906 --> 18:26.944
Get off of me.

18:26.977 --> 18:28.948
I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna
have to put your clothes on.

18:28.981 --> 18:30.286
People are trying to eat!

18:30.319 --> 18:31.553
Was this year's
Dundies a success?

18:31.588 --> 18:32.756
Well, let me see.

18:32.790 --> 18:35.396
I made Pam laugh so hard, that
she fell out of her chair.

18:35.429 --> 18:37.400
That she almost
broke her neck.

18:37.433 --> 18:38.868
So I killed.
Almost.

18:40.571 --> 18:41.640
Oh, my God!

18:41.673 --> 18:42.510
I just wanna say,

18:42.542 --> 18:45.516
that this was the best
Dundies ever!

18:45.548 --> 18:47.520
Whoo!

18:47.552 --> 18:49.623
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

18:49.656 --> 18:52.430
We have a strict policy here
not to over serve.

18:52.463 --> 18:54.767
Apparently this young woman
was sneaking drinks

18:54.800 --> 18:56.503
off other people's tables.

18:56.538 --> 18:58.408
I Xeroxed her
driver's license,

18:58.442 --> 18:59.643
and she is not welcome

18:59.676 --> 19:01.448
at this restaurant
chain ever again.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.487
Great work tonight.
Watch your step.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.022
Excellent.
Thanks.

19:06.055 --> 19:08.362
I had to, uh,
check her pupils

19:08.394 --> 19:10.465
to make sure
that wasn't a concussion.

19:10.498 --> 19:12.569
Yes, that too,
but I mean with the audio.

19:12.603 --> 19:13.971
Great, great work.

19:17.613 --> 19:20.486
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

19:20.518 --> 19:22.655
No, you don't.

19:24.793 --> 19:27.500
Oh, here she is.

19:27.532 --> 19:29.437
Careful,
careful, whoa.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.441
All right.
Easy.

19:31.473 --> 19:33.512
Almost there.

19:33.544 --> 19:38.388
Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?

19:38.422 --> 19:40.526
Shoot.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.642
Um...I just wanted
to say thanks.

19:48.674 --> 19:51.448
That's not really
a question.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.952
Okay, let's get
you home, pronto.

19:57.993 --> 20:00.666
All right.
