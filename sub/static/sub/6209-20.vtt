00:04.698 --> 00:07.213
- Hi, Aunt Zelda.
- Good morning, Sabrina.

00:07.378 --> 00:09.973
That's an interesting
take on pyjamas.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.891
By the way, can I borrow
your blue sweater?

00:12.058 --> 00:14.891
Oh, no, honey. You're just not
responsible with my clothes.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.333
Remember what happened when
you borrowed my red blouse?

00:17.497 --> 00:19.328
Who knew silk was so flammable?

00:19.497 --> 00:22.534
Responsible behaviour is taking
care of the things you use.

00:22.696 --> 00:25.085
If I didn't take good care of
my mountain-climbing equipment,

00:25.256 --> 00:27.212
I could really hurt myself out there.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.095
Hey, you're back. How was Everest?

00:29.255 --> 00:31.167
Oh, a little crowded, but I had fun.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.975
- Responsible fun.
- Did Salem enjoy it?

00:35.454 --> 00:40.164
Zelda? Zelda?

00:40.894 --> 00:42.772
Is that a yeti?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.251 --> 01:03.642
I fought the law and the law won.

01:08.770 --> 01:11.410
Quick rehearsal. First, you compliment
him on his sweater vest.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.242
And then you ask him
if he's lost weight.

01:13.409 --> 01:14.446
What are you guys doing?

01:14.610 --> 01:17.488
Oh, we're gonna ask Mr. Kraft
for his permission and some money

01:17.650 --> 01:20.084
to attend a journalism
symposium in New York.

01:20.249 --> 01:21.762
Well, he's in a good mood.

01:21.928 --> 01:24.682
He was smiling when he
filled out this detention slip.

01:25.609 --> 01:28.282
- Mr. Kraft? We were wondering--
- No.

01:28.448 --> 01:30.485
We've got him
right where we want him.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.526
- Mr. Kraft looked really cute today--
- No.

01:34.687 --> 01:36.963
You two are more alike
than you think.

01:37.247 --> 01:40.159
Sabrina, I am not going out
with Willard Kraft again.

01:40.326 --> 01:41.840
Know what we did on our last date?

01:42.006 --> 01:44.043
We toured an accordion factory.

01:44.206 --> 01:45.606
But you guys have
so much in common.

01:45.766 --> 01:48.758
I mean, you could talk about
literature, art,

01:48.925 --> 01:51.759
why Valerie and I should be allowed
to attend this journalism symposium.

01:51.925 --> 01:54.315
No. Just the thought of his lips
in the same building as mine

01:54.484 --> 01:56.077
makes my blood run cold.

01:56.244 --> 01:57.917
That's just what Bacall
said about Bogie.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.081
It's from the Other Realm
Revenue Service.

02:02.243 --> 02:03.472
Mm, let me see.

02:03.963 --> 02:05.238
They're auditing our magic.

02:05.403 --> 02:08.441
You know, bureaucracy makes the
Other Realm seem less enchanting.

02:08.603 --> 02:10.162
This is just a formality.

02:10.322 --> 02:11.359
See, in the mortal realm,

02:11.523 --> 02:13.832
witches are allotted
a specific amount of magic.

02:14.322 --> 02:16.756
They were pretty lenient
until the Pompeii incident.

02:16.921 --> 02:19.914
Some witch with a lava fetish
really messed up.

02:20.081 --> 02:21.640
Auditors check up
on you now and again

02:21.801 --> 02:24.110
to make sure that everything's
under control.

02:24.281 --> 02:26.954
But we have nothing to worry about.
I'll just summon our accountant.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.869
Marty?

02:31.840 --> 02:34.308
Zelda, Hilda. What's up?

02:34.479 --> 02:37.313
It really bothers me that
I don't find this weird.

02:37.919 --> 02:39.672
Are we interrupting anything?

02:39.838 --> 02:42.273
No. Just celebrating
our receptionist's birthday.

02:42.438 --> 02:43.554
Would you like some cake?

02:43.718 --> 02:46.358
- Sabrina?
- It's Valerie.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.756
Hey. I've got big news.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.954
Tell me. Oh, but upstairs.

02:55.397 --> 02:57.274
Is that filing cabinet tapping?

02:57.436 --> 03:00.270
Yeah, Val. There's a guy in there.

03:04.716 --> 03:06.230
Marty.

03:06.396 --> 03:08.432
The Other Realm
is auditing our magic.

03:08.595 --> 03:11.429
An audit? That's what I live for.

03:11.995 --> 03:13.508
Here's your return from last year.

03:13.675 --> 03:14.664
Give it a look-see.

03:16.074 --> 03:17.508
Oh. Time for the conga line.

03:17.673 --> 03:20.427
Don't worry.
I'll make sure everything's in order.

03:20.593 --> 03:21.710
We'll be in touch.

03:21.874 --> 03:23.990
Marge, stop twirling
your blouse around

03:24.153 --> 03:26.793
and get off the copy machine.

03:26.953 --> 03:28.625
Your grandmother wants to
sell you her car?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.988
Isn't it amazing? I mean,
it's not fancy or anything.

03:31.152 --> 03:34.622
Like, there's no air conditioning
or tape player or radio or heat.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.908
And the windows don't open.
And it smells like lilacs.

03:37.071 --> 03:38.824
But, hey, it's a car.

03:39.311 --> 03:41.542
It's your first set of wheels.
It's so fantastic.

03:41.711 --> 03:44.589
I know. There's just one
small problem. I can't afford it.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.140
- Granny's trying to gouge you?
- But I have a plan.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.621
Okay, suppose you and I
pool our savings and buy it together.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.179
- We'll share it.
- What a great idea.

03:53.349 --> 03:54.385
Do you what this means?

03:54.549 --> 03:56.939
Our lives are about to change
in an utter and profound way.

03:57.109 --> 04:00.465
It'll be you, me and the open road.

04:00.628 --> 04:02.938
Free to go wherever
the spirit moves us.

04:03.108 --> 04:05.942
Except left,
because that blinker's broken.

04:06.468 --> 04:07.458
Well, I don't know.

04:07.627 --> 04:10.097
Owning a car is a big responsibility.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.020
We've budgeted for
maintenance and insurance.

04:12.187 --> 04:14.224
And worked out a way
to share it equitably.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.345
See, I get the car every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday

04:17.505 --> 04:19.144
from 9 to 12 and from 5 to 8:30.

04:19.305 --> 04:20.786
Except for every third Wednesday

04:20.946 --> 04:23.016
when Val needs the car
at 8:20 instead of 8:30.

04:23.186 --> 04:25.223
See, and I get it every Sunday,
Tuesday and Thursday

04:25.386 --> 04:26.978
from 11:15 to 2 and from 7 to 10,

04:27.145 --> 04:28.738
except on the second
Tuesday in November

04:28.905 --> 04:30.305
and the fourth Tuesday
in January,

04:30.465 --> 04:32.183
I don't have to return it until 10:15.

04:32.344 --> 04:35.098
And on Saturdays, I get the car until 4,
Val gets it until 6

04:35.264 --> 04:37.573
and then we alternate
every hour until midnight.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.257
I'm getting dizzy.

04:39.743 --> 04:41.382
But you two do seem on top of it.

04:41.543 --> 04:43.454
All we have to do
is figure out leap year.

04:43.623 --> 04:44.943
I guess it's okay with us.

04:45.103 --> 04:46.696
- Yes.
- All right.

04:46.862 --> 04:49.219
Okay, so according to the schedule,
the car is mine tonight?

04:49.382 --> 04:50.702
Yep.

04:50.902 --> 04:52.699
Hey, can I borrow it?

05:41.616 --> 05:44.289
I can't believe I wanted to share
a car with someone whose motto is:

05:44.455 --> 05:46.208
"I paid for these bumpers,
I'll use them."

05:46.375 --> 05:48.844
Well, at least I don't use
fast-food wrappers as seat covers.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.404
- Hey.
- Do you look for tow-away zones?

05:51.574 --> 05:53.133
What's it like to
lose a car three times

05:53.294 --> 05:55.489
in the same parking lot
on the same day?

05:57.053 --> 05:58.123
Enough.

05:58.293 --> 06:00.524
You two are too old
to be fighting like this.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.412
Though I bet Sabrina
could have taken her.

06:02.573 --> 06:05.485
I was right. You're not responsible
enough to handle a car.

06:05.972 --> 06:08.203
I think you should ask Valerie
to give your share back.

06:08.372 --> 06:09.931
Fine. I'll buy my own car.

06:10.092 --> 06:12.732
No. You may not have a car.

06:12.892 --> 06:14.531
Really?

06:14.812 --> 06:17.042
Not today, not ever.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.281
It's all Valerie's fault.

06:18.451 --> 06:19.884
I could have handled that car alone.

06:20.051 --> 06:21.325
Refresh my memory.

06:21.490 --> 06:24.369
Was it Valerie who locked me
in the glove compartment?

06:24.530 --> 06:26.840
Hey, nobody likes a back-seat cat.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.126
I never understood why you
didn't buy your own car.

06:29.610 --> 06:31.999
Let's see. There's the fact
that I have virtually no money,

06:32.169 --> 06:33.364
my profound lack of cash

06:33.529 --> 06:35.121
and, oh, yeah, I'm broke.

06:35.288 --> 06:37.086
Well, not here. In the Other Realm.

06:37.248 --> 06:38.922
Over there, cars go for peanuts.

06:39.088 --> 06:40.442
Really? How come?

06:40.608 --> 06:44.396
Cars became more of a novelty item
once witches realised they could fly.

06:44.568 --> 06:47.163
If my aunts ask where I went,
tell them I'm being very responsible

06:47.327 --> 06:50.047
doing something
responsible people do.

06:50.526 --> 06:53.042
Avoiding hot dogs at the track?

06:53.207 --> 06:56.643
Well, I'm sure you'll see our magic
is completely in order.

06:56.806 --> 06:58.558
Thank you for being
so accommodating.

06:58.726 --> 07:03.481
I've never understood it, but some
people just don't enjoy being audited.

07:03.645 --> 07:04.965
Is that right?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.479
Well, we'll summon our accountant

07:06.645 --> 07:09.113
and then you'll be on your way
in no time.

07:09.844 --> 07:12.996
- Marty?
- Marty, it's time for our audit.

07:13.283 --> 07:14.434
Well, that's odd.

07:14.604 --> 07:16.481
Zelda, he's not here.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.316
What's this?

07:18.483 --> 07:19.917
"Dear Zelda and Hilda,

07:20.083 --> 07:21.563
don't take this the wrong way,

07:21.723 --> 07:24.237
but I've run off with
all your magic savings."

07:24.402 --> 07:25.597
Oh, no.

07:25.762 --> 07:26.878
"Someday you'll forgive me,

07:27.042 --> 07:30.592
until then, could you water my plants?
Marty."

07:30.762 --> 07:32.639
This can't be true.

07:38.201 --> 07:39.714
Excuse me.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.315
Another piña colada, <i>por favor.</i>

07:45.400 --> 07:46.959
There must be some mistake.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.633
I'll check the rest of the house--

07:48.799 --> 07:50.472
Not so fast, blondie.

07:57.279 --> 07:58.837
Anything I can help you with,
ma'am?

07:58.998 --> 08:00.512
Quizmaster?
What are you doing here?

08:00.678 --> 08:01.714
Sabrina.

08:02.277 --> 08:04.269
I work here part-time.

08:04.437 --> 08:08.510
Quizmastering may be my life's work,
but it doesn't exactly pay the rent.

08:08.677 --> 08:10.986
Not with the money
you spend on clothes.

08:11.156 --> 08:14.354
Well, I'd like to buy a car,
but I'm pretty sure I can't afford one.

08:14.836 --> 08:16.316
Well, can you afford
a $5 down payment

08:16.476 --> 08:17.591
and a buck 15 a month?

08:17.755 --> 08:18.746
If I budget.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.393
Then you can drive home
in this baby.

08:21.556 --> 08:22.750
- Get out.
- Come on.

08:22.915 --> 08:24.031
Let's take it for a spin.

08:24.195 --> 08:27.028
You can see how it drives
and I can pick up my dry cleaning.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.905
Buckle up.

08:34.352 --> 08:35.753
Woo.

08:39.153 --> 08:40.188
Woo-hoo!

08:40.393 --> 08:42.624
<i>Mr. Pike,
report to the service desk.</i>

08:42.793 --> 08:44.511
<i>Mr. Pike, please report
to the service desk.</i>

08:44.672 --> 08:46.106
So, what do you think?

08:46.272 --> 08:47.945
This car handles like a dream.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.671
I mean, did you see the way I swerved
to miss that baby carriage?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.823
The last thing I saw
was that school bus.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.061
I want this car.

08:54.231 --> 08:56.063
There's just one last thing
we need to go over.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.223
Now, owning a car is
a big responsibility, Sabrina.

08:58.391 --> 08:59.791
Are you sure you can handle it?

08:59.951 --> 09:02.021
Yes. Jeez, you sound like my aunts.

09:02.550 --> 09:03.825
Everything okay here, miss?

09:03.990 --> 09:05.549
This is my boss.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.702
Responsibility, schmonsibility.

09:07.869 --> 09:10.225
A car like this is all about fun.

09:10.389 --> 09:12.267
Top down, wind in your hair--

09:12.429 --> 09:13.942
Okay. You can save the pitch, okay?

09:14.108 --> 09:16.668
I've got a picture of Lincoln
that's burning a hole in my pocket.

09:16.829 --> 09:19.218
- I'm buying this car.
- You've made a wise decision.

09:19.388 --> 09:22.698
Nothing makes driving
more enjoyable than a car.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.302
Now, you have to be very careful
when taking this car out.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.821
Because accidents, they do happen.

09:28.987 --> 09:31.183
I don't need another
responsibility lecture.

09:31.347 --> 09:32.496
Oh, this isn't a lecture.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.101
I also sell insurance.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.937
So did you go for the Mack truck
like I told you to?

09:41.106 --> 09:44.939
Nothing commands respect
like 18 wheels and girlie mud flaps.

09:45.104 --> 09:46.504
I picked out the cutest little car.

09:46.664 --> 09:51.102
Dual exhaust, ragtop, Connolly hide,
which I think is a good thing.

09:51.263 --> 09:53.016
They even threw in--

09:55.344 --> 09:56.413
--free delivery.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.815
Now, that can't be good
for the transmission.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.422
Sabrina. Are you okay?

10:07.582 --> 10:09.175
It sounded like something fell.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.537
Something like a redwood.

10:10.702 --> 10:12.454
What's going on in there?

10:13.141 --> 10:14.257
Salem and I are clogging.

10:14.421 --> 10:16.014
Good night.

10:16.581 --> 10:17.935
I've gotta zap this to the street.

10:18.101 --> 10:20.217
If my aunts see it,
I can kiss driving it goodbye.

10:20.380 --> 10:23.532
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't imply that I clog.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.534
Why--? Why isn't it working?

10:27.699 --> 10:29.133
Check the emergency brake.

10:29.299 --> 10:30.938
Oh, right.

10:40.537 --> 10:42.415
Good, that'll buy me some time.

10:42.577 --> 10:43.568
Whoa.

10:43.737 --> 10:46.457
- I like this game.
- What's wrong with my magic?

10:46.617 --> 10:48.847
<i>Nothing.
I just don't like being alone.</i>

10:49.016 --> 10:50.007
You can talk?

10:50.176 --> 10:51.451
<i>It was on my sticker.</i>

10:51.936 --> 10:53.165
<i>I don't wanna sleep outside.</i>

10:53.336 --> 10:55.895
<i>In case you haven't noticed,
it's cold.</i>

10:56.415 --> 10:58.725
Look, I know you'd rather stay
in my room, but you can't.

10:58.895 --> 11:01.012
My aunts would kill me
if they found out.

11:01.175 --> 11:03.484
<i>I could catch pneumonia out here.</i>

11:03.655 --> 11:06.806
You could, if you had
blood and organs.

11:06.974 --> 11:08.124
Sabrina?

11:08.294 --> 11:09.887
Oh, no. Keep it down, okay?

11:10.494 --> 11:13.167
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You sound like my first wife.</i>

11:13.333 --> 11:16.167
Hey. I thought I heard you.
Who were you talking to?

11:16.333 --> 11:19.404
Pet lizard.
Where did that little guy run off to?

11:19.573 --> 11:20.892
I came by to apologise.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.362
You know all those horrible,
nasty things I said about you?

11:23.532 --> 11:25.649
- I didn't mean them.
- Me neither.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.087
- Friends?
- Friends.

11:29.611 --> 11:32.490
Hey, hot car. When did you get it?

11:32.691 --> 11:34.569
Uh, just a few minutes ago.

11:34.731 --> 11:37.609
From a new neighbour
who's moving to Australia.

11:37.770 --> 11:38.965
It's so cool.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.486
- Can I borrow it?
- But you have a car.

11:41.650 --> 11:45.404
My grandma's ride to church died,
so she wants it back. Please?

11:45.569 --> 11:47.720
Valerie, this is kind of
hard to explain, but--

11:47.889 --> 11:50.324
Those files aren't gonna
carry themselves in here.

11:50.489 --> 11:52.560
Just let me hear Jerry
Springer's thought for the day

11:52.729 --> 11:54.640
and I'll meet you in the garage.

11:54.808 --> 11:57.926
Uh, sure, you can borrow it. In fact,
why don't you keep it at your place?

11:58.088 --> 11:59.841
That way you can park it
somewhere warm

12:00.008 --> 12:01.236
and it will never be lonely.

12:01.408 --> 12:03.364
- Lonely?
- British engineering.

12:03.527 --> 12:06.167
Very delicate. Here.

12:06.646 --> 12:08.285
Thank goodness we saved this stuff.

12:08.446 --> 12:09.880
No, I saved it.

12:10.366 --> 12:12.835
I save things.
I just forget where I save them.

12:13.006 --> 12:15.520
That's called losing things.

12:15.885 --> 12:18.878
If I hadn't had the foresight
to put everything in my name,

12:19.045 --> 12:20.763
the house, the phone,
the credit cards

12:20.925 --> 12:22.961
we would never get out
from under this audit.

12:23.124 --> 12:26.117
So how was the garage?
Nice and empty?

12:28.044 --> 12:29.717
It's from the auditors.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.803
Oh, what a relief.

12:31.964 --> 12:33.238
They're cancelling the audit?

12:33.403 --> 12:35.793
No. It says they're
only going to audit you.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.078
Why would that be?

12:37.563 --> 12:40.077
Because everything's in your name.

12:40.242 --> 12:43.792
Good luck, sis. Looks like there's
nothing but free time for me.

12:43.962 --> 12:45.635
And what better way to
enjoy that free time

12:45.802 --> 12:47.953
than by relaxing in the company
of Mr. Kraft?

12:48.121 --> 12:49.350
No.

12:49.521 --> 12:51.035
I really think my plan
is gonna work.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.193
I'll just keep the car
hidden at Valerie's.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.558
You know,
this is how people get hurt.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.077
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.798
<i>Hello to you too.</i>

13:01.960 --> 13:04.759
<i>You know, that little brunette
is a menace to motoring.</i>

13:04.919 --> 13:06.638
<i>And she sings along with the radio.</i>

13:06.799 --> 13:08.472
<i>Either that or she's been injured.</i>

13:11.118 --> 13:12.109
Hello?

13:12.278 --> 13:14.509
Sabrina. I just looked outside
and I can't find your car.

13:14.678 --> 13:15.794
I think somebody stole it.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.074
Oh, no, no, no. I've got it.
The car's here with me.

13:18.237 --> 13:19.274
Phew!

13:19.438 --> 13:21.713
- Oh, well, good night.
- See you tomorrow.

13:22.157 --> 13:24.068
<i>Hey, I heard a good story.</i>

13:26.356 --> 13:28.474
- Hello?
- Why did you take the car?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.305
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

13:31.476 --> 13:35.674
I mean, you'd think they'd tire of it
after maybe six or seven times, but no.

13:35.835 --> 13:41.149
These seniors still seem to find
removing my brake fluid very amusing.

13:41.315 --> 13:44.546
Let me get this straight. Your aunt had
an allergic reaction to frozen yogurt,

13:44.714 --> 13:47.183
so you came over to my house
in a cab and took the car?

13:47.354 --> 13:48.833
In a manner of speaking.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.269
Did you drive it to school today?

13:50.434 --> 13:51.584
No. I left it at home.

13:51.753 --> 13:54.825
Hey. Did you guys see the cool orange
MGB parked in front of the school?

13:54.993 --> 13:58.542
- Oh, I did drive it. That's mine.
- But I have the keys.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.305
I hot-wired it.
Can I have the keys back?

14:00.472 --> 14:02.350
Okay. Let me borrow it
during lunch, please?

14:02.512 --> 14:04.390
I don't know.
It depends on how it's behaving.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.270
I mean running.

14:06.431 --> 14:08.104
It was fine.

14:08.272 --> 14:09.751
Thanks, Sabrina.

14:09.991 --> 14:12.107
Where did you ever learn
how to hot-wire a car?

14:12.270 --> 14:14.068
My Aunt Zelda.

14:14.310 --> 14:15.983
She did time.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.547
When are you gonna let me
tune up your new ride?

14:19.030 --> 14:22.261
My dad showed me how to make
a car go 80 miles an hour in first gear.

14:22.749 --> 14:24.502
Why would anyone want
their car to do that?

14:24.989 --> 14:26.059
He didn't say.

14:26.788 --> 14:27.825
Hey.

14:27.989 --> 14:29.582
- I need my keys.
- Oh, I don't have them.

14:29.749 --> 14:31.865
- I did something you'll love me for.
- I am?

14:32.028 --> 14:33.747
- I lent your car to Mr. Kraft.
- What?

14:33.908 --> 14:36.502
Apparently, he's got a hot date
and a car with no brake fluid.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.260
And guess what
he gave us in return.

14:38.428 --> 14:41.817
Permission and bus fare to
attend the journalism symposium.

14:41.987 --> 14:43.307
Way to go, Valerie.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.537
Did Mr. Kraft say where
he was going on his date?

14:45.707 --> 14:49.256
I don't know. When he started singing
"I'm in the Mood for Love," I got woozy.

14:52.946 --> 14:56.461
So until you produce your
missing savings account,

14:56.625 --> 14:58.741
we're putting a lien on your magic.

14:58.904 --> 15:00.737
No magic cabinet,

15:00.905 --> 15:02.497
no magic cauldron,

15:02.664 --> 15:05.179
no labtop.

15:09.503 --> 15:11.938
But I'm a witch.
How will I cast spells?

15:12.103 --> 15:13.219
With this.

15:25.101 --> 15:26.615
This isn't magic.

15:26.781 --> 15:28.897
This is a crummy bar mitzvah.

15:30.740 --> 15:34.131
Well, don't you look stupid.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.098
Sabrina, what are you
doing home so late?

15:37.579 --> 15:41.971
I was looking for Mr. Kraft
to return a pen I borrowed.

15:42.139 --> 15:45.371
There haven't been any live police
chases on TV tonight, have there?

15:45.539 --> 15:47.770
Mr. Kraft is at the drive-in
with your aunt Hilda.

15:47.939 --> 15:49.452
- What?
- Isn't that nice?

15:49.938 --> 15:52.009
I'm stunned with happiness.

15:52.178 --> 15:54.613
Hilda knew how much you wanted
to go to that symposium,

15:54.778 --> 15:56.734
so she thought she'd
put in a good word for you.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.172
That was so sweet.

15:58.337 --> 15:59.407
I should thank her.

15:59.577 --> 16:02.648
In fact, I should thank her right now.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.088
A Joe Don Baker retrospective.

16:07.576 --> 16:09.852
- What a treat.
- Yep.

16:10.016 --> 16:12.575
Buford Pusser fans don't come
any bigger than me.

16:20.894 --> 16:22.488
Hey. Hey, car.

16:22.654 --> 16:23.724
<i>Oh, look who's here.</i>

16:23.894 --> 16:26.203
<i>Miss I'll-Let-Anybody-Drive-Him.</i>

16:26.693 --> 16:29.288
Look, I promise you can stay
in my room forever, okay?

16:29.453 --> 16:31.967
If you just do me a favour and
behave yourself tonight, okay?

16:32.133 --> 16:35.284
<i>I bet you don't even care
that I'm parked on gum.</i>

16:35.452 --> 16:38.570
I do care. It's just that's my aunt and
my vice principal in your front seat,

16:38.732 --> 16:40.530
so if you could just
keep your voice down.

16:40.692 --> 16:41.727
<i>You really had me fooled.</i>

16:41.891 --> 16:43.565
<i>I thought you were kind
and warm-hearted.</i>

16:44.892 --> 16:45.961
<i>Boy, was I wrong.</i>

16:46.131 --> 16:47.247
Did you just snort?

16:48.610 --> 16:51.205
Look, I'll explain everything later,
okay? Honest.

16:51.370 --> 16:52.361
<i>Later, later, later.</i>

16:52.530 --> 16:54.487
<i>You never have time for me.</i>

16:54.650 --> 16:56.164
Now you sound like your first wife.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.889
<i>That's hitting below the fan belt.</i>

16:59.049 --> 17:00.608
<i>I need to be alone.</i>

17:00.769 --> 17:02.806
No. No, don't do that.
That would be bad.

17:19.287 --> 17:21.438
Please don't be in my room.
Please don't be in my room.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.757
Please don't be in my room.

17:24.886 --> 17:27.720
All right. Chalk one up to the power
of positive thinking.

17:30.126 --> 17:31.559
Aunt Hilda, how was the movie?

17:31.725 --> 17:34.285
I laughed, I cried.
You're in big trouble.

17:34.445 --> 17:36.960
What about Mr. Kraft?
I mean, did you put him under a spell?

17:37.125 --> 17:39.639
No. Fortunately,
he passed out from terror.

17:43.284 --> 17:44.797
Still breathing.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.603
I know it's gonna be a while before
you two are done yelling at me,

17:47.763 --> 17:49.959
so should we brew a magic potion
for Mr. Kraft?

17:50.123 --> 17:52.637
I can't.
The auditors booted my labtop.

17:52.802 --> 17:55.636
Besides, sometimes I worry that
all those potions we give him

17:55.802 --> 17:58.397
are gonna have some sort
of side effect.

18:04.641 --> 18:07.759
Willard, you are so witty.
Thanks again for a lovely evening.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.070
- Good night.
- Hilda.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.354
I was--

18:15.120 --> 18:18.430
I have got to start
videotaping my dates.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.554
We have to think of a suitable
punishment for Sabrina.

18:21.718 --> 18:24.279
She has to learn how to
behave responsibly.

18:24.439 --> 18:28.557
It's time like these that I regret
donating our iron maiden to Goodwill.

18:28.718 --> 18:30.789
Well, look at that.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.746
They always return to
the scene of the crime.

18:35.357 --> 18:38.555
Zelda, Hilda, what I did was wrong.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.709
You better not be talking
about buying that shirt.

18:40.877 --> 18:42.913
You two have done so much for me.

18:43.076 --> 18:45.910
You've kept me employed. You--
You put a roof over my head.

18:46.076 --> 18:47.954
How will I ever earn
your forgiveness?

18:48.436 --> 18:52.270
You can start by paying us back
all the magic you stole from us.

18:52.755 --> 18:56.510
There's a slight problem with that.
See, the guy at the casino--

18:57.034 --> 18:59.151
Okay. I'll earn it back. I will.

18:59.314 --> 19:01.829
I just need a place
to lie low for a while.

19:01.994 --> 19:03.348
We know the perfect place.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.430
Zelda? Hilda?

19:09.592 --> 19:11.949
Anybody?

19:12.593 --> 19:14.390
Is that a yeti?

19:15.473 --> 19:18.704
<i>Any available
service manager, Line 1.</i>

19:18.872 --> 19:20.100
Quizmaster.

19:20.272 --> 19:22.342
I can't handle this thing.
It's nothing but trouble.

19:22.511 --> 19:23.945
That's why I sold you this car.

19:24.111 --> 19:26.068
To make you realise
you weren't ready for one.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.062
You took a job here
just to teach me a lesson?

19:28.550 --> 19:30.826
No. I've got college loans.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.301
Well, let's take this baby to Guido
and turn back its odometer.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.223
<i>Make yourself scarce, huckster.</i>

19:36.389 --> 19:39.939
<i>I need a few minutes alone
with Miss Learner's Permit.</i>

19:40.109 --> 19:42.385
No problem.
That Chrysler's teaching me Spanish.

19:44.468 --> 19:46.188
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

19:47.508 --> 19:50.579
<i>Me too. I've got something
for you on my dash.</i>

19:51.467 --> 19:54.824
<i>Any
available service manager, Line 1.</i>

19:55.427 --> 19:57.544
"What is a friend?" Aw.

19:57.827 --> 20:01.263
<i>If you read the inside,
you'll see that a friend is someone</i>

20:01.426 --> 20:05.658
<i>who changes someone's oil
once in a while.</i>

20:07.065 --> 20:08.785
I'll miss you too.

20:09.705 --> 20:11.378
Walking shoes are
a much better investment.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.776
They're fun, cheap and
no way you can ruin friendships

20:13.944 --> 20:15.504
or endanger innocent lives, right?

20:15.665 --> 20:18.384
I loved that sports car.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.303
- Kraft alert.
- How bad could it be?

20:20.464 --> 20:22.773
He already said we couldn't go
to the journalism symposium.

20:22.944 --> 20:24.218
Miss Spellman.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.179
Just the little miscreant
I've been looking for.

20:27.343 --> 20:29.858
Good, because I gotta go
to metal shop.

20:30.343 --> 20:32.573
Me too. If you're late, they
don't let you wear the masks.

20:32.742 --> 20:34.142
Now, hold it.

20:34.822 --> 20:35.938
You know what I have here?

20:36.541 --> 20:38.022
- Your drawings?
- No.

20:38.501 --> 20:42.381
It's a file that I've been keeping on you
and all of your strange behaviour.

20:42.861 --> 20:44.375
But they're illustrated, right?

20:45.060 --> 20:48.020
For instance, the other night
I went to the movies with your aunt.

20:48.181 --> 20:51.730
And the next thing I know,
I'm alone on your front porch.

20:51.899 --> 20:53.175
Explain that.

20:53.340 --> 20:54.773
Oh, well,
you know what they say about

20:54.939 --> 20:56.817
men your age and memory lapses.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.733
Okay, if you say so,
I'll check into the chess club.

20:59.899 --> 21:01.413
Gotta go.

21:03.138 --> 21:06.336
Mother's right.
I need more potassium.

21:09.258 --> 21:12.489
Thank goodness my magic
will be restored next week.

21:12.657 --> 21:15.171
I despise doing laundry
the mortal way.

21:15.337 --> 21:18.250
Here's a tip:
It's not equal parts water and bleach.

21:19.457 --> 21:22.732
Oh, I see you decided to bring Marty
back from outer space.

21:22.896 --> 21:24.125
Not exactly.

21:25.935 --> 21:27.165
Haven't I been punished enough?

21:27.335 --> 21:30.692
