WEBVTT

00:00.004 --> 00:01.587
Previously, on The Fosters...

00:01.851 --> 00:03.916
WOMAN: Are you the student
responsible for the art installation?

00:03.988 --> 00:05.988
I'm a professor at San Diego
School of Art and Design.

00:06.323 --> 00:08.506
GRACE: You should do one
thing a day that scares you.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.508
- What was that?
- My one scary thing for tomorrow.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.345
Jesus and I want to build
this massive tree house,

00:13.380 --> 00:14.462
and I thought that you could help.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.548
I cannot believe that
you knew about Emma.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.350
Jesus is starting to get suspicious.

00:18.385 --> 00:21.303
- You took Emma to get an abortion?
- Stop!

00:21.305 --> 00:25.140
- I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.
- I hope that we're okay.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.360
The motion to dissolve the
Anchor Beach Charter is carried.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.312
CROWD: Education is a right!

00:30.314 --> 00:32.229
Get your hands off my sister!

00:32.281 --> 00:33.481
- (Grunts)
- Aah!

00:33.533 --> 00:34.936
If I don't got back to Russell,

00:34.937 --> 00:36.318
- he's gonna kill me.
- I'll go.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.320
Hold your fire! That's my daughter!

00:38.372 --> 00:41.456
What's it gonna take for you
to start valuing your life?

00:41.491 --> 00:43.158
(Sighs)

00:46.330 --> 00:48.380
LENA: Looks like the new
neighbors are moving in.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.166
STEF: Here's hoping they're an
improvement over the last ones.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.254
(Sighs)

00:57.307 --> 01:00.342
Um, I forgot to ask the detectives.

01:00.344 --> 01:03.178
Am I'm gonna have to
testify in Russell's trial?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.230
Well, your phone in the
bag ties him to the meth.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.265
The kidnapping charge
is going to be an issue.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.100
Why?

01:09.152 --> 01:10.518
Because she got into the van willingly,

01:10.570 --> 01:12.354
knowing that he was a pimp.

01:12.356 --> 01:14.272
Well, at least he's off the street.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.408
I mean, that might not have happened
if I hadn't gone with Diamond.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.276
You know what could
have happened, Callie?

01:18.328 --> 01:19.361
You could have been raped,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.363
or you could have been
beaten or... or killed.

01:21.365 --> 01:23.498
Okay? This is nothing to celebrate.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.500
And in spite of the fact
that Troy Johnson confessed,

01:25.535 --> 01:27.644
the D.A. has not dropped
the breaking and entering

01:27.645 --> 01:29.120
or the hit and run or charges,

01:29.172 --> 01:31.206
so you're not out of the
woods yet, young lady.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.359
(Door Slams)

01:39.433 --> 01:41.516
Honey, she was terrified.

01:41.551 --> 01:44.302
She didn't know where you were
or what was happening to you.

01:48.225 --> 01:49.391
I know.

02:00.404 --> 02:03.121
Congratulations!

02:03.156 --> 02:04.406
What, uh... what's this?

02:04.408 --> 02:06.241
Well, my lawyers called this afternoon,

02:06.293 --> 02:09.294
and all charges have been
dropped against Callie.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.463
I am so proud of you.
You stuck to your guns.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.415
You, uh, even saved an innocent kid

02:13.417 --> 02:15.216
from spending the rest
of his life in prison.

02:15.252 --> 02:17.218
Hip-hip!

02:17.254 --> 02:18.470
Hooray!

02:18.505 --> 02:20.422
Come on, guys. Our sister's a hero.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.257
- MARIANA: Hip-hip!
- BOYS: Hooray!

02:22.259 --> 02:24.426
- Hip-hip! Hip-hip!
- Hooray! Hooray!

03:13.143 --> 03:15.276
Hey. You guys want cake?

03:17.447 --> 03:18.496
Thanks.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.152
How long are you gonna stop
speaking to your brother?

03:24.154 --> 03:26.154
How long are you gonna
stop speaking to Mariana?

03:26.156 --> 03:28.156
Forever. It's different.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.542
(Phone Vibrates)

03:32.162 --> 03:34.579
Sorry. World stuff.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.498
When, uh... when do you leave?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.132
Wednesday.

03:38.168 --> 03:41.169
So, how's the team? You know, without...

03:41.221 --> 03:43.171
She was our best coder, but...

03:43.173 --> 03:46.341
we don't have to deal with her
trying to micro-manage everyone.

03:46.343 --> 03:48.476
How's the tree house going?
Has she taken over yet?

03:48.512 --> 03:50.428
No.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.230
No, she just found us a tree.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.517
Give her time. She will...

03:57.521 --> 03:59.270
take over.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.191
(Scoffs)

04:05.195 --> 04:08.079
I'm gonna go get some cake.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.531
So, I'm getting the feeling

04:09.533 --> 04:11.449
you're not very happy
with this little party.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.202
Robert, we appreciate
everything you do for Callie.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.204
We just would have liked a
little bit of a head's up.

04:16.206 --> 04:18.540
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I
just wanted to surprise her.

04:18.541 --> 04:20.507
Well, we've had enough surprises.

04:20.543 --> 04:23.127
Yeah, but this is... this is good news.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.512
The ends don't justify
the means, Robert.

04:24.548 --> 04:26.347
Okay, she's made a
couple of mistakes, but...

04:26.383 --> 04:29.434
She keeps making mistakes, and we
should in no way celebrate them.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.138
Okay, is there something
else here that I don't know?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.356
(Clears Throat)

04:39.563 --> 04:41.479
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

04:44.234 --> 04:46.234
Uh, yeah. Sure.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.239
So, I... I've... I've been thinking...

04:51.291 --> 04:53.207
and I...

04:53.243 --> 04:55.460
wanna do my senior project by myself.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.249
Well, you can't.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.551
Drew said it was too
expensive for just one student.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.336
Well... I know.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.088
But, I just... I thought that

05:07.140 --> 05:09.507
I could talk to him myself
and see what he says.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.427
Was this Emma's idea?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.395
No. No, not at all.

05:14.431 --> 05:16.397
I just...

05:16.433 --> 05:19.317
I need to prove that I can do something

05:19.352 --> 05:21.102
on my own.

05:22.439 --> 05:24.105
You know?

05:29.195 --> 05:32.280
Callie, look. I know
I'm not your parent.

05:32.282 --> 05:34.415
All right, but I want to help.

05:34.451 --> 05:36.451
- I don't need your help.
- Well, we do.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.171
Lena and I, we're at our wits'
end. We can't watch you 24/7.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.173
We have four other
teenagers in this house

05:42.208 --> 05:43.591
who also need our attention.

05:43.627 --> 05:46.127
So, you want me to go live with Robert?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.462
No.

05:47.584 --> 05:49.617
(Sighs) I just wanna
spend more time with you,

05:49.669 --> 05:52.503
support you in making better decisions.

05:52.539 --> 05:54.622
You have nothing but
opportunity in front of you

05:54.674 --> 05:56.340
if you so choose it.

05:56.376 --> 05:58.376
You're gonna be
graduating in a few months.

05:58.428 --> 06:00.545
You gotta finish your
college applications.

06:00.547 --> 06:02.597
What about the professor from
the College of Art and Design?

06:02.632 --> 06:05.133
- Did you follow up with her?
- No.

06:05.185 --> 06:07.135
Why not?

06:07.187 --> 06:09.220
Callie, we love you,

06:09.272 --> 06:12.223
but there's only so much
that any of us can do for you.

06:14.527 --> 06:17.395
You need to decide who you
want to be, going forward,

06:17.447 --> 06:19.397
because this...

06:19.399 --> 06:21.365
this girl is not acceptable.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.709
So, what are you gonna
do on your day-off?

06:31.201 --> 06:33.334
You know me. I'm probably
gonna go to the spa,

06:33.370 --> 06:35.453
get a massage, a little mani-pedi.

06:35.455 --> 06:38.256
Well, if you have time
between treatments,

06:38.291 --> 06:40.174
maybe you could pick up something

06:40.210 --> 06:41.376
to bring to the new neighbors?

06:41.428 --> 06:44.462
- Sure, any suggestions?
- Oh, whatever's fine.

06:44.464 --> 06:47.298
All right. A plant. That's a good...

06:47.300 --> 06:49.217
No, don't get a plant.
No one wants a plant.

06:49.269 --> 06:51.219
You're buying them an obligation.

06:51.271 --> 06:54.188
- Bottle of wine.
- What if they don't drink?

06:54.224 --> 06:56.190
Are you sure that you
don't have any suggestions?

06:56.226 --> 06:58.142
No, it's all up to you.

07:00.447 --> 07:03.114
How about a bird feeder.
Everybody likes a bird feeder.

07:03.149 --> 07:05.066
- You mean a rat feeder?
- Okay, seriously?

07:05.118 --> 07:07.201
I'm sorry. Really.
Anything you choose is fine.

07:07.237 --> 07:09.070
It's just the gesture that counts, so.

07:09.122 --> 07:10.989
(Laughs)

07:11.041 --> 07:13.241
Are we doing the right thing?

07:13.293 --> 07:16.160
I... I'm assuming you've
changed the subject.

07:16.162 --> 07:19.297
Involving Robert more in Callie's life?

07:19.332 --> 07:21.382
I mean, don't forget, he
did fight us for custody.

07:21.418 --> 07:24.135
Well, Callie's turning 18 in six months,

07:24.170 --> 07:26.054
so... not an issue any more.

07:26.089 --> 07:28.172
Okay, good. Because we
already have one birth father

07:28.174 --> 07:30.341
living in our garage.

07:30.377 --> 07:33.227
Well, you know what they
SAY: "It takes a village."

07:33.263 --> 07:35.146
This is so not like you.

07:41.354 --> 07:44.022
I just... I just think that
after this last thing with Callie,

07:44.074 --> 07:45.440
I... I really...

07:47.277 --> 07:50.078
I really don't know what to do.

07:52.248 --> 07:54.115
I know. That was so awful for you.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.117
I'm so sorry.

07:56.169 --> 07:57.368
I'm so sorry.

07:59.255 --> 08:01.372
How can I help? What can I do?

08:01.424 --> 08:03.174
Figure out what to get the neighbors.

08:03.209 --> 08:04.425
(Laughs)

08:04.461 --> 08:07.045
I'm serious.

08:08.515 --> 08:11.299
(Knocking)

08:14.054 --> 08:15.470
- What?
- (Knocking)

08:15.522 --> 08:17.305
What?

08:17.357 --> 08:19.140
Ow!

08:25.065 --> 08:26.314
- Hey.
- Can I come in?

08:26.366 --> 08:28.483
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Come in.

08:28.535 --> 08:32.236
Okay. Jesus wants to do
his senior project alone,

08:32.288 --> 08:34.238
but I need you to say
that you won't help

08:34.289 --> 08:35.490
unless it's both our projects,

08:35.542 --> 08:38.076
because you can't choose sides.

08:38.078 --> 08:39.293
Okay?

08:39.328 --> 08:41.162
Um...

08:42.549 --> 08:45.166
So, you know I'm on
the school paper, right?

08:45.218 --> 08:48.052
I know you fold the copies
and stack them in the hallway.

08:48.088 --> 08:49.420
It's an entry-level position,

08:49.422 --> 08:51.472
but I will be writing someday.

08:51.508 --> 08:53.224
Sorry.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.259
So, I probably shouldn't
be showing you this.

08:55.261 --> 08:58.262
But I took a screenshot
of an opinion piece

08:58.314 --> 09:00.148
that they're publishing
in tomorrow's paper.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.353
(Knocking)

09:05.405 --> 09:07.438
What did you need?

09:07.440 --> 09:10.274
I thought we agreed we
weren't going to assign blame

09:10.326 --> 09:12.026
for what happened at the protest.

09:12.078 --> 09:14.112
Oh. Yeah, we did agree,

09:14.164 --> 09:16.447
but that article doesn't
quote me or anyone on the board

09:16.449 --> 09:19.000
or administration, so it's just...

09:19.035 --> 09:20.118
one kid's opinion.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.170
An opinion that blames the students,

09:22.205 --> 09:25.123
when, in fact, Mr. Stratos put
his hands on my daughter first.

09:25.175 --> 09:26.110
And your son shoved him.

09:26.111 --> 09:28.126
And the guards you
hired pepper-sprayed him.

09:28.178 --> 09:29.427
He's lucky I didn't suspend him.

09:29.462 --> 09:31.212
And you're lucky I don't sue you...

09:31.264 --> 09:32.463
and the school.

09:35.268 --> 09:37.135
(Sighs) Look.

09:37.137 --> 09:39.470
This article is only gonna
rile everybody up again.

09:39.722 --> 09:41.439
Not everybody. There was a lot of kids

09:41.474 --> 09:45.109
who weren't at the protest and
aren't happy about what happened.

09:45.145 --> 09:48.362
You're not suggesting that
I censor them, are you?

09:50.233 --> 09:52.283
WOMAN: I'm really glad
you reached out, Callie.

09:52.318 --> 09:54.202
CALLIE: Thank you,
again, for meeting me.

09:54.237 --> 09:56.287
This is all, like, really amazing.

09:56.322 --> 09:58.372
Well, I hope you'll
consider our program,

09:58.408 --> 10:00.408
but applications are due soon.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.244
Uh, what criteria are they looking for?

10:03.329 --> 10:05.213
Grades and SAT scores, of course.

10:05.248 --> 10:08.082
But they're interested in the whole
student, so your essay is important

10:08.134 --> 10:11.169
- and, of course, your portfolio.
- Um...

10:11.171 --> 10:13.337
Portfolio? Like... like, what?

10:13.339 --> 10:17.341
- Your body of work.
- I don't really have a body of work.

10:17.343 --> 10:20.178
Um, I have some photographs,

10:20.230 --> 10:22.346
but my senior project is pretty much it.

10:22.398 --> 10:25.516
I'm surprised to hear that, given
the sophistication of that piece.

10:25.552 --> 10:27.435
(Laughs) Um...

10:27.487 --> 10:30.188
So, how many pieces would
I need in my portfolio?

10:30.240 --> 10:33.107
At least twenty really good ones.

10:36.246 --> 10:38.196
Look. You know, there's
always next year.

10:39.365 --> 10:43.451
I can't wait until next
year. I need this now.

10:43.503 --> 10:45.419
Could you, maybe...

10:46.673 --> 10:49.457
Do you think you could help
me build it for this year?

10:57.433 --> 10:59.217
So, how'd it go?

11:02.055 --> 11:04.438
Oh, I have to have a portfolio.

11:05.475 --> 11:08.276
What does... what does that mean?

11:08.311 --> 11:11.112
Just art school's not an option,

11:11.147 --> 11:12.480
at least not this year.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.367
It's okay though. I...

11:16.402 --> 11:18.402
I could go to community
college for a year

11:18.404 --> 11:20.404
- and maybe apply after that.
- (Scoffs)

11:24.294 --> 11:26.210
Maybe I should just do something else.

11:26.246 --> 11:27.495
I don't even know if I'm an artist.

11:36.366 --> 11:37.415
Hey.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.700
Hi.

11:39.735 --> 11:43.654
So, Mariana just told me
that this tree house project

11:43.706 --> 11:46.373
was approved for her and not Jesus,

11:46.409 --> 11:48.242
because he might not
be a senior next year?

11:48.294 --> 11:50.377
Well, we don't... we
don't know that for sure.

11:50.413 --> 11:52.546
But he has no idea, right?

11:52.582 --> 11:54.715
You know, there are a lot of
unknowns with someone who has a TBI.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.384
We just don't want to frighten
Jesus with all the what-ifs.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.553
Yeah, no, I... I get it,

11:59.589 --> 12:02.590
but keeping things from him blew
up in a pretty big way, you know?

12:04.427 --> 12:06.594
Listen, Gabe, we really do appreciate

12:06.596 --> 12:08.562
your helping the kids
out with this project,

12:08.598 --> 12:11.398
but as far as what we tell Jesus

12:11.434 --> 12:13.651
about his situation, that's
our call, Lena's and mine.

12:16.355 --> 12:18.606
Right. Okay, I got it. I'm... sorry.

12:18.658 --> 12:21.242
No, it's all good. It's all good.

12:23.663 --> 12:25.362
We're in a drought, you know.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.281
I'm allowed to water twice a week!

12:27.283 --> 12:28.499
Ass.

12:28.534 --> 12:31.285
- I'm sorry. What?
- No, no. Not you!

12:31.287 --> 12:34.388
That... that guy. I'm Dean
Bayfield, your new neighbor.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.290
Oh! Oh, my... hi.

12:36.342 --> 12:38.626
I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm
Stefanie Adams Foster.

12:38.678 --> 12:41.212
Nice to meet you. Sorry we haven't

12:41.264 --> 12:43.380
welcomed you to the
neighborhood. It's just been...

12:43.432 --> 12:45.599
No, no. No problem. We're
up to our necks in boxes.

12:45.635 --> 12:48.219
Oh, yeah. I hear ya. (Laughs)

12:48.271 --> 12:49.637
I just wanted to talk
to you about your fence.

12:49.639 --> 12:52.273
It's leaning on to our property.

12:53.442 --> 12:55.526
- Is it?
- Yeah, it looks like the post is rotting.

12:55.561 --> 12:58.279
- They probably should have put in concrete.
- Ah.

12:58.314 --> 13:00.648
Do you mind if I fix it?

13:00.650 --> 13:03.651
Yeah. Uh, well. I mean, how
much is it gonna cost? 'Cause...

13:03.653 --> 13:05.653
Oh, oh. Nothing. I'll...
I'll do it myself.

13:05.655 --> 13:07.488
I just didn't want to do
it without your permission.

13:09.208 --> 13:12.376
Uh, yeah. That would be very... great.

13:12.411 --> 13:14.378
I appreciate... we would...
that would be great.

13:14.413 --> 13:15.629
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

13:15.665 --> 13:17.498
It's nice to meet you.
And once we get settled,

13:17.500 --> 13:19.333
- we'd love to have you over.
- That would be great.

13:19.335 --> 13:21.385
- Us too. Have you over.
- (Chuckles) Okay.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.504
Have a good one.

13:23.556 --> 13:26.307
This is so unfair. Why can't
we tell our side of the story?

13:26.342 --> 13:28.259
Because your side
could get you suspended?

13:28.311 --> 13:30.261
- We have to fight back.
- Honey, we are fighting.

13:30.313 --> 13:31.762
We're making our case to
the Department of Education

13:31.814 --> 13:34.532
that Monty was still the principal
and that Drew's vote doesn't count.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.400
In the meantime,

13:36.435 --> 13:37.601
I need you guys to try to stay calm

13:37.653 --> 13:39.486
and not agitate the situation.

13:39.522 --> 13:41.438
Okay. Get to class.

13:42.608 --> 13:44.692
JUDE: This sucks.

13:44.694 --> 13:47.411
When do they send the
paper to the printer?

13:47.446 --> 13:49.363
They already did.

13:49.415 --> 13:51.248
Hm.

13:51.284 --> 13:53.534
What if they caught an
error and sent a new file?

13:56.255 --> 13:57.538
Hey, Callie.

13:57.590 --> 14:00.207
I need you to make arrangements
to pick up your senior project.

14:00.209 --> 14:01.258
We don't have room to store it.

14:02.378 --> 14:05.512
- Uh, you can just toss it.
- Are you sure?

14:05.548 --> 14:07.548
Yeah, I don't really have
anywhere to keep it either.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
So really, it's fine.

14:12.221 --> 14:13.637
- So, how was your day?
- It was good!

14:13.689 --> 14:15.389
You know, I actually
met our new neighbors.

14:15.441 --> 14:17.391
The husband, anyway. His name is Dean.

14:17.443 --> 14:19.226
And guess what?

14:19.278 --> 14:22.279
He offered to fix our
fence and pay for it.

14:22.315 --> 14:24.565
- Can you believe that?
- Wow. What's he do for a living?

14:24.617 --> 14:27.534
Um, I don't... I don't...
I don't know. I didn't ask.

14:27.570 --> 14:30.571
- Did you get his wife's name?
- Uh, no.

14:30.623 --> 14:32.406
Do they have children?

14:32.458 --> 14:34.625
Oh, my gosh. I didn't
interrogate him. I just said hi.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.378
You know, for a detective, it's
surprising how little information

14:37.413 --> 14:39.463
- you get out of normal people.
- Ha, ha. That's so funny.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.500
No, I'm actually excited that we might

14:41.501 --> 14:44.419
have neighbors we can be friends with.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.553
(Saw Buzzing Loudly)

14:50.259 --> 14:51.508
(Laughs)

14:51.560 --> 14:53.560
I wonder how friendly they're
gonna be about the power saw.

14:53.596 --> 14:56.647
Do we have any idea how long it's
gonna take to build this thing?

14:56.682 --> 14:59.566
Well, hopefully not long,
then Gabe can be on his way.

14:59.602 --> 15:02.403
Something happen?

15:02.438 --> 15:05.522
(Sighs) Just a little
unsolicited parenting advice.

15:05.574 --> 15:07.608
Oh, well, you're the one
who said it takes a village.

15:07.660 --> 15:09.610
A statement I may live to regret.

15:09.662 --> 15:12.196
Speaking of, did you talk to Robert?

15:12.248 --> 15:13.447
How did Callie's meeting go?

15:14.617 --> 15:16.200
Not well.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.454
Um, okay... So, uh...

15:20.506 --> 15:23.207
Helen just called me...
the art professor...

15:23.259 --> 15:26.210
she changed her mind. She's
gonna let me audit her classes

15:26.262 --> 15:28.262
and help me put my portfolio together,

15:28.297 --> 15:30.264
so I can apply for college this year!

15:32.468 --> 15:34.184
STEF: That's amazing!

15:37.356 --> 15:38.439
(Exhales)

15:43.586 --> 15:44.618
Hey.

15:45.754 --> 15:48.338
Hey. You lose something?

15:48.374 --> 15:50.424
Um... no.

15:50.459 --> 15:53.544
I have to bring an
object that defines me

15:53.596 --> 15:55.679
tomorrow for a still life.

15:55.714 --> 15:57.598
This is so amazing. I mean,

15:57.633 --> 15:59.516
you know it's one of the best
art schools in the country.

16:00.786 --> 16:04.304
I know. What are you doing?

16:04.306 --> 16:05.606
I am, uh...

16:05.641 --> 16:07.441
(Clears Throat) applying for a job.

16:07.476 --> 16:10.561
Do you think I'll be better at
flipping burgers or scooping ice cream?

16:11.647 --> 16:14.448
That's a hard call.
You'd be so bad at both.

16:14.483 --> 16:15.649
(Laughs) Yup.

16:15.701 --> 16:17.451
(Cell Phone Beeps )

16:18.737 --> 16:20.621
How's that going?

16:20.656 --> 16:23.574
Uh... it's not. (Scoffs)

16:23.626 --> 16:25.375
Why?

16:25.411 --> 16:27.160
(Drawer Opens, Rattles)

16:27.162 --> 16:28.960
Well, Grace is in college,
and I'm a high school senior

16:28.961 --> 16:31.331
not going to college next year.

16:32.468 --> 16:33.667
I'm not exactly boyfriend material.

16:33.669 --> 16:35.636
No, you... you can apply again, right?

16:35.671 --> 16:37.588
Well, after a year, but I mean,

16:37.640 --> 16:39.423
I don't think I'm gonna
get into Juilliard twice.

16:39.475 --> 16:40.757
(Laughs)

16:42.595 --> 16:45.562
Brandon, you are so talented.

16:45.598 --> 16:48.599
Okay? You... you're gonna get into

16:48.651 --> 16:50.434
a really great music school.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.654
Don't feel bad for me.

16:53.689 --> 16:56.523
Okay? And please feel good for yourself.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.526
And you absolutely deserve this.

16:59.578 --> 17:00.744
Thanks.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.335
Maybe this could be my still life.

17:08.771 --> 17:10.503
I'm "salty," right?

17:16.795 --> 17:20.380
MARIANA: I'm sorry! It takes
me an hour to dry my hair.

17:20.382 --> 17:22.382
Not that you would know, with
your perfect air dry curls.

17:22.384 --> 17:23.520
I used to blow my hair
straight too, Mariana.

17:23.521 --> 17:25.435
It's called time management.

17:25.471 --> 17:26.770
LENA: Hi!

17:26.805 --> 17:28.555
Oh, hi.

17:28.557 --> 17:29.723
Good morning. You're our new neighbors.

17:29.775 --> 17:33.443
Hi, I'm Theresa and
this is my son, Logan.

17:33.479 --> 17:35.445
Hi. Lena. This is my daughter, Mariana.

17:35.481 --> 17:37.731
- Hi.
- Hi. I love your car.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.566
It's so...

17:39.618 --> 17:40.867
LOGAN AND MARIANA: Back To The Future.

17:40.903 --> 17:43.453
LENA: Sorry we haven't been over
sooner to introduce ourselves.

17:43.489 --> 17:45.489
- We just... we have five teenagers.
- Oh, God. Bless you.

17:45.541 --> 17:47.541
- We just have the one.
- (Laughs)

17:47.576 --> 17:49.409
- So, are you new to San Diego?
- No.

17:49.461 --> 17:51.745
I grew up here, but I did
my residency at Johns Hopkins

17:51.797 --> 17:54.498
where I met my husband,
and then I just stayed.

17:54.550 --> 17:57.417
- LENA: So what brings you back?
- THERESA: The weather, mainly.

17:57.419 --> 17:58.802
And I miss the beach. (Laughs)

17:58.837 --> 18:01.588
- So, obviously you're a doctor.
- Yeah. An orthopedic surgeon.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.758
- Where are you going to school?
- I'm not sure yet. Uh...

18:04.760 --> 18:06.760
Somewhere with a good
football team, though.

18:06.762 --> 18:09.313
- You play football?
- Yeah.

18:09.348 --> 18:11.598
We're on our way to tour a charter now.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.517
Not Anchor Beach Charter?

18:13.569 --> 18:15.519
Oh, no. No. We didn't hear good things.

18:15.571 --> 18:17.688
Yeah, that's the school that
a kid brought a gun to, right?

18:17.740 --> 18:19.656
Yeah. I'm sure you
guys heard about that.

18:19.692 --> 18:21.608
It's so scary.

18:21.610 --> 18:23.410
Where do your kids go?

18:24.496 --> 18:26.580
Anchor Beach Charter.

18:28.534 --> 18:30.617
Oh, m... I am so sorry.

18:30.619 --> 18:32.753
You know, I'm sure it's great.

18:32.788 --> 18:34.538
And...

18:34.590 --> 18:37.791
you know, honestly, we're probably
not gonna go with a charter.

18:37.793 --> 18:39.593
We're more private school people.

18:39.628 --> 18:41.511
Ah.

18:41.547 --> 18:44.348
Well, you might like
Anchor Beach academy then.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.473
ROBERT: Hey, listen. Before you go,

18:53.525 --> 18:55.475
I have something in the trunk for you.

19:03.318 --> 19:06.403
The guy at the art store, he
said it's a good, basic case

19:06.455 --> 19:07.554
with all the essentials.

19:08.707 --> 19:10.457
Thank you.

19:12.661 --> 19:14.461
All right.

19:14.496 --> 19:15.662
Have a great class.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.748
I'll be here when you're done.

19:20.669 --> 19:23.553
- (Students Chattering)
- (Phone Rings)

19:27.626 --> 19:28.709
- Hey.
- GRACE: Hey.

19:28.761 --> 19:31.294
Uh, are you busy right now?

19:31.347 --> 19:34.598
I have a job interview in a
little while. Why? What's up?

19:34.633 --> 19:38.435
Well, I'm in a situation, and
I could really use your help.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.687
- Right now?
- Yeah. Like, right now.

19:40.723 --> 19:42.472
It's kind of an emergency.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.562
Have you seen this?

19:48.614 --> 19:51.531
Yes. The Anchor Beach Sea Breeze
is where I get all my news.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.484
Okay.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.319
"Not the fake news:

19:56.321 --> 19:58.321
What really happened
the night of the protest

19:58.323 --> 20:00.407
and why we should fight
to keep our school public."

20:01.460 --> 20:03.460
Someone hacked into
the school email server,

20:03.495 --> 20:05.328
sent a "revised" file to the printer

20:05.330 --> 20:07.664
that included this unauthorized article.

20:07.716 --> 20:09.666
Okay. Well, I'm not sure what
you want me to do about it.

20:11.804 --> 20:14.638
- Are your kids behind this?
- Not that I know of.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.590
Because if they are, that's
grounds for expulsion.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.479
I mean, talk about
working the students up.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.599
Well, the article doesn't
appear to quote you

20:25.651 --> 20:28.318
or anyone on the board
or administration.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.770
It's just one kid's opinion, right?

20:31.356 --> 20:34.324
(Rock Music Playing)

20:38.614 --> 20:40.580
Callie, this is Ximena.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.449
Ximena won the Scholastic Art Awards

20:42.501 --> 20:44.534
gold medal for mixed media last year.

20:44.586 --> 20:46.703
- Wow! Congratulations.
- (Chuckles) Thanks.

20:46.755 --> 20:48.705
She's agreed to let you shadow her.

20:48.707 --> 20:49.873
Thank you.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.676
So, did you bring an object
that you feel defines you?

20:52.711 --> 20:54.711
Yeah, I think so.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.464
Okay. Then I'll leave you ladies to it.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.719
Thank you so much for... for doing this.

21:02.771 --> 21:04.604
Yeah, of course.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.306
Is that a new art set?

21:07.693 --> 21:10.560
Yeah. It's, um... it was a gift.

21:10.612 --> 21:12.446
Nice.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.564
So, why don't you get set right here.

21:14.616 --> 21:17.284
(Music Continues)

21:19.571 --> 21:20.570
Are those yours?

21:20.622 --> 21:23.373
Yeah. I'm on a derby team.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.408
"X-terminate Her."

21:25.410 --> 21:27.627
- Is that your derby name?
- Yeah.

21:27.663 --> 21:29.629
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

21:30.666 --> 21:31.748
So, what did you bring to sketch?

21:33.802 --> 21:35.719
Um...

21:35.754 --> 21:38.505
I think I'm gonna just
sketch my new art set.

Uh...

22:33.805 --> 22:36.773
you know how I'm trying to do
one thing a day that scares me?

22:36.808 --> 22:38.475
Yeah.

22:38.477 --> 22:40.643
Yeah, so I decided to...

22:40.696 --> 22:43.646
hook up, like, a
booty-call thing with my ex

22:43.699 --> 22:45.482
and, you know, try something kinky,

22:45.484 --> 22:47.534
but we ended up getting into a fight...

22:47.569 --> 22:50.487
an argument, not a physical thing...

22:50.489 --> 22:52.655
and he just tossed the
keys and left me like this.

22:52.708 --> 22:54.708
What a dick.

22:54.743 --> 22:55.809
Yeah.

23:13.512 --> 23:15.345
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:17.516 --> 23:18.681

23:20.402 --> 23:22.452

make to my interview if I...

- Yes, you should go.
- If I go right now.

23:23.739 --> 23:26.406
- Yes, go, please.
- I'll talk to you later?

23:26.441 --> 23:28.274
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Here you go.

23:28.310 --> 23:29.492
All right.

Yeah, good. I'm just, you
know, getting some ideas.

23:47.512 --> 23:49.462
Can I ask...

23:49.514 --> 23:52.515
why you chose art supplies as,

23:52.551 --> 23:54.467
you know, the thing that defines you?

23:56.388 --> 23:59.389
I guess, you know, just because, um...

23:59.391 --> 24:00.640
you know, I want to be an artist.

24:00.692 --> 24:03.309
Aren't you already an artist?

24:03.361 --> 24:06.279
No, I'm really still just a beginner.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.530
Look,

24:07.566 --> 24:09.399
I've never heard of Helen

24:09.401 --> 24:12.285
ever allowing anyone to
audit a class of hers,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.370
especially a high school senior.

24:14.406 --> 24:16.372
I mean, I figured she made an exception

24:16.408 --> 24:18.374
because she was impressed with you.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.376
As in, like, already an artist,

24:20.412 --> 24:21.628
not a wannabe one.

24:22.664 --> 24:25.415

24:52.444 --> 24:54.410
Well, yeah, but I mean,

24:54.446 --> 24:57.497
she's not really gonna
work with me on it anymore.

24:57.532 --> 24:59.415
Oh. Why not?

24:59.451 --> 25:02.252
I mean, I want to do
something by myself.

25:02.287 --> 25:04.370
Since I got this TBI,

25:04.422 --> 25:07.290
people treat me like I...
I... I'm special needs.

25:07.342 --> 25:08.286
Plus, you know Mariana.

25:08.287 --> 25:09.626
She's just gonna take
control of the whole thing

25:09.628 --> 25:11.427
and make it all about her.

25:11.463 --> 25:13.379
I don't think that's true, Jesus.

25:13.431 --> 25:16.633
Well, I don't think you
really know her, Gabe.

25:17.719 --> 25:19.519
That's...

25:19.554 --> 25:21.521
I mean, I don't...

25:21.556 --> 25:23.356
know her very well,

25:23.391 --> 25:24.557
but, you know...

25:26.311 --> 25:27.393
she talked to me.

25:27.445 --> 25:29.395
She talked to you. Yeah,
of course she talked to you.

25:29.447 --> 25:31.481
She's... she's trying
to get you on her side.

25:31.483 --> 25:32.565
(Sighs)

25:34.569 --> 25:37.370
You can't do the senior
project without her.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.656
Wait, okay. So you are
gonna take her side?

25:39.658 --> 25:41.491
The school won't let you.

25:41.493 --> 25:43.743
Why? Because it's too expensive?
She told me the same thing.

25:43.795 --> 25:45.662
- She's probably just making it up.
- Oh, no.

25:45.714 --> 25:47.630
- That's not why.
- Then why?

25:49.668 --> 25:52.418
- Talk to your moms.
- All they do is lie to me

25:52.470 --> 25:54.554
and keep secrets.
They're not gonna tell me.

25:56.391 --> 25:57.423
So, what is it?

25:59.912 --> 26:01.862
Hey, Lena.

26:01.914 --> 26:04.865
So, I thought about what you
said. I think you're right.

26:05.137 --> 26:07.337
We don't need to be riling the
kids up with the school paper,

26:07.389 --> 26:08.940
so I decided to shut it down

26:08.941 --> 26:11.090
until the future of Anchor
Beach has been decided.

26:11.143 --> 26:13.309
Why don't we just
suspend the Op-ed section?

26:13.345 --> 26:15.395
Whoever hacked our
email could strike again,

26:15.430 --> 26:18.348
and there really should
be consequences for that.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.350
Oh, also, um...

26:20.352 --> 26:22.185
until I know what's happening next year,

26:22.237 --> 26:24.521
I'm no longer funding any
juniors doing senior projects.

26:26.108 --> 26:27.357
I'll see you.

26:30.162 --> 26:31.528
- Yeah, that's great.
- Thanks.

26:33.365 --> 26:35.115
Hey, Callie. What's up?

26:35.167 --> 26:37.167
Um...

26:37.202 --> 26:40.086
did my father, Robert Quinn...

26:40.122 --> 26:42.288
did he have anything to do

26:42.340 --> 26:45.175
with you changing your
mind about helping me?

26:45.210 --> 26:46.376
I did speak to your father.

26:48.346 --> 26:49.546
So, what? He just...

26:49.598 --> 26:51.381
he wrote a big check to the school,

26:51.433 --> 26:54.184
so that you'd let me audit your class?

26:54.219 --> 26:55.552
Where do you want us to spray fixative?

26:55.554 --> 26:58.388
You can go to the
spray booth. Or outside.

27:06.565 --> 27:08.364
Hey, Ximena.

27:09.568 --> 27:11.284
Can I get a ride?

27:11.319 --> 27:13.286
Where?

27:13.321 --> 27:15.238
Anywhere.

27:15.290 --> 27:16.322
Let's go.

27:19.077 --> 27:20.543
Hello?

27:20.579 --> 27:22.245
Jesus, wait!

27:22.297 --> 27:24.247
Okay...

27:24.299 --> 27:27.217
I'm not gonna be a senior next year?

27:28.253 --> 27:31.087
(Sighs) We don't know that, Jesus.

27:31.139 --> 27:33.473
- Look, I'm sorry. I just couldn't lie to him.
- No one asked you to lie.

27:33.508 --> 27:35.258
I asked you not to get involved.

27:35.260 --> 27:37.093
No, I'm glad that he did!

27:37.145 --> 27:39.262
At least someone around here
is telling me the truth now!

27:39.264 --> 27:41.181
- Hey! Listen to me...
- MARIANA: What's going on?

27:41.233 --> 27:43.266
I know the senior project
is yours and not mine,

27:43.268 --> 27:44.484
which I'm sure that you love.

27:44.519 --> 27:47.437
- Jesus, I need you to calm down.
- No, I am not gonna calm down!

27:47.489 --> 27:51.107
Then you can go to your room until
you are willing to listen to me.

27:52.577 --> 27:53.676
Now!

27:56.414 --> 27:58.581
You too, Mariana. I need
to speak with Gabe, please.

27:58.717 --> 28:00.366
What? No. I'm not going up there.

28:00.418 --> 28:03.086
- Mariana, please!
- After what he did to Brandon's room?

28:03.121 --> 28:04.454
What if he takes a
baseball bat to my head?

28:07.125 --> 28:08.341
Hi, Emma.

28:10.128 --> 28:12.295
Is this a bad time?

28:12.347 --> 28:15.048
No, it's okay. Jesus is up in his room.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.467
I'm sure he would like
to see you about now.

28:23.475 --> 28:25.275
If you cannot respect our authority

28:25.310 --> 28:26.476
as the twins' parents,

28:26.528 --> 28:28.228
I am going to have to ask you to leave.

29:18.196 --> 29:19.445
Hey.

29:21.366 --> 29:24.417
So, I just need to change
and can give you a ride home.

29:24.452 --> 29:27.086
Oh, it's okay. My brother's
coming to get me, so.

29:27.122 --> 29:28.504
Okay.

29:28.540 --> 29:30.456
You're awesome.

29:30.508 --> 29:33.126
How did you get into roller derby?

29:33.178 --> 29:35.461
Well, I was an angry 14-year-old

29:35.513 --> 29:38.097
- with a lot of hormonal rage.
- (Laughs)

29:38.133 --> 29:39.515
I needed a safe place

29:39.551 --> 29:42.468
to knock the crap out of
people and not get arrested,

29:42.520 --> 29:45.054
so I joined the junior team.

29:45.106 --> 29:47.307
- Your parents were cool with that?
- No way.

29:47.359 --> 29:50.109
See, girls aren't
supposed to be aggressive.

29:50.145 --> 29:52.312
We're taught to keep it all inside.

29:52.364 --> 29:55.398
But in derby, I get to unleash my beast.

29:55.450 --> 29:57.066
Be fearless.

29:58.286 --> 30:01.454
Must be nice to have
somewhere to let go.

30:01.489 --> 30:03.239
You don't need permission.

30:04.576 --> 30:08.378
I just... I with I had
somewhere to unleash my beast.

30:08.413 --> 30:10.129
You do.

30:10.165 --> 30:11.164
Your art.

30:11.216 --> 30:14.300
See, you can put all
that chaos on a canvas.

30:14.336 --> 30:17.470
No offense, but do you really think

30:17.505 --> 30:20.089
a shiny new art set defines who you are?

30:20.141 --> 30:22.175
Or who you want to be?

30:22.227 --> 30:23.259
No.

30:24.429 --> 30:26.596
Look.

30:26.598 --> 30:30.149
If you try to be someone
you're not, you won't be happy.

30:30.185 --> 30:32.268
And as an artist,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.270
you won't have anything to say.

30:44.366 --> 30:46.449
Hey. Um, how'd your job interview go?

30:46.451 --> 30:49.452
I was late, so I probably didn't
make a great first impression.

30:49.454 --> 30:51.287
Why were you late?

30:51.339 --> 30:53.539
Grace needed help with something.

30:53.591 --> 30:55.258
Is she okay?

30:55.293 --> 30:56.626
Uh...

30:56.628 --> 30:58.511
it was... it was kind
of weird, actually.

30:58.546 --> 31:00.463
So, I showed up at her apartment,

31:00.515 --> 31:04.133
and she was handcuffed to the
bed and couldn't reach the keys.

31:04.135 --> 31:05.351
Apparently she was hooking up

31:05.387 --> 31:08.104
with her... ex-boyfriend or something,

31:08.139 --> 31:09.439
and I guess they got into a fight,

31:09.474 --> 31:11.441
and he left her like that.

31:12.477 --> 31:14.444
What?

31:14.479 --> 31:17.146
Pretty sure she was trying
to have sex with you.

31:17.198 --> 31:19.232
What? No, no, no.

31:19.284 --> 31:21.534
Yeah. She made a very bold move,

31:21.569 --> 31:24.537
and... obviously it backfired.

31:26.574 --> 31:28.374
Oh, my God.

31:28.460 --> 31:30.576
Jesus is gonna be so disappointed.

31:30.628 --> 31:34.247
Well, the one silver lining
is that Gabe can move on...

31:34.299 --> 31:36.132
and out.

31:38.336 --> 31:40.386
- Can I come in?
- Yes, please.

31:40.422 --> 31:41.504
Um...

31:43.341 --> 31:46.225
Jesus, can you come down here, please?

31:46.261 --> 31:48.344
I just wanted to apologize.

31:48.346 --> 31:50.346
I had no right telling Jesus.

31:53.651 --> 31:56.319
STEF: Hey, bud. Can you sit
down for a minute, please?

31:56.354 --> 31:58.237
Can everybody sit down so we can talk?

32:00.325 --> 32:03.159
Um, I want to try to
be a senior next year,

32:03.194 --> 32:05.361
even if that means I have
to go to summer school.

32:05.413 --> 32:07.530
Honey, that's... that's
really good to hear,

32:07.582 --> 32:11.167
um, but your senior project
will have to wait until then.

32:12.454 --> 32:14.087
Wait, why?

32:14.122 --> 32:16.089
Why? Because I got mad?
What, are you punishing me?

32:16.124 --> 32:18.091
- STEF: No, buddy.
- LENA: No.

32:18.126 --> 32:19.375
(Sighs)

32:19.427 --> 32:22.545
Drew isn't funding any
senior projects for juniors.

32:22.597 --> 32:25.098
What? (Scoffs)

32:25.133 --> 32:26.349
- You're lying.
- Jesus!

32:26.384 --> 32:27.467
Jesus!

32:27.519 --> 32:30.103
LENA: No, I'm not lying.

32:30.138 --> 32:31.752
He's cutting a lot of
things until we know

32:31.753 --> 32:33.108
what's happening with Anchor Beach.

32:34.442 --> 32:36.392
Okay, but can... can I do it anyway?

32:38.313 --> 32:40.229
Honey, we just don't
have the money for that.

32:41.566 --> 32:43.199
Well, what if...

32:43.234 --> 32:45.201
what if, um...

32:46.237 --> 32:47.570
There's a lot of scrap wood

32:47.622 --> 32:49.572
I can probably get
my hands on out there.

32:49.574 --> 32:51.374
And the other materials,

32:51.409 --> 32:55.161
I could probably get
Jesus's uncle to donate.

32:55.213 --> 32:56.546
His birth uncle, you mean?

32:56.581 --> 32:59.248
Right. Sorry.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.259
Please?

33:01.386 --> 33:03.085
Moms?

33:08.593 --> 33:11.394
Karen! Hey, um...

33:11.429 --> 33:14.096
I decided I do what to
keep my senior project.

33:14.149 --> 33:17.316
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. We took
it to the dumpster already.

33:18.436 --> 33:20.520
You know what? Maybe it's still there.

33:20.572 --> 33:22.104
- Yeah.
- Go on.

33:38.405 --> 33:40.307
Something must have
happened in art class.

33:40.508 --> 33:42.258
(Door Opens)

33:46.314 --> 33:47.396
Where you been, Cal?

33:48.599 --> 33:49.732
I was worried.

33:51.519 --> 33:53.602
I can't be the girl with the rich dad

33:53.654 --> 33:55.654
who writes a check to
get her into art school.

33:57.692 --> 33:59.325
I... I...

33:59.360 --> 34:00.526
I...

34:00.578 --> 34:01.660
I didn't write a check.

34:01.696 --> 34:04.363
I know that you went to
Helen after I met with her.

34:04.415 --> 34:05.614
Yes, to talk to her.

34:05.616 --> 34:08.501
All right, but I didn't...
I didn't give them any money.

34:08.536 --> 34:12.338
All right, I just
reminded her of your story,

34:12.373 --> 34:14.456
of why you don't have a portfolio,

34:14.458 --> 34:16.257
because you were never in one home

34:16.293 --> 34:19.545
or one home school long enough
to recognize your potential.

34:19.597 --> 34:21.741
That you never got a chance.
That's all I asked her to do,

34:21.742 --> 34:23.248
was just to give you a chance.

34:23.384 --> 34:25.684
But only if she
believed in you, which...

34:25.719 --> 34:27.469
obviously she does.

34:29.607 --> 34:31.273
You don't.

34:33.643 --> 34:37.228
I know you all think
that I'm "unacceptable."

34:37.281 --> 34:39.614
Oh, wait, that...
that's not what we meant.

34:39.650 --> 34:41.367
That's what you said.

34:41.402 --> 34:44.703
Now, I know that
you're really mad at me,

34:44.739 --> 34:46.655
but when you first met me

34:46.657 --> 34:49.324
you told me that I wasn't disposable,

34:49.327 --> 34:51.494
and I'm really trying to believe that.

34:51.496 --> 34:54.246
I'm not mad at you.

34:54.297 --> 34:55.664
I'm scared for you.

34:57.668 --> 35:00.219
I'm scared of losing you, Cal.

35:01.389 --> 35:02.638
I can't just throw away

35:02.673 --> 35:04.557
all that stuff that happened to me.

35:04.592 --> 35:06.592
Honey, we don't want you to.

35:06.644 --> 35:08.310
(Lena Sighs)

35:09.480 --> 35:10.646
Come with me.

35:24.445 --> 35:26.529
LENA: I saw them taking
it to the dumpster.

35:28.699 --> 35:31.367
We don't want you to throw
away your past, Callie.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.453
We just want you to stop repeating it.

35:34.505 --> 35:36.505
STEF: We want you to be safe, Callie.

35:36.541 --> 35:39.291
You know, we want you to be 17.

35:39.343 --> 35:40.928
You don't need to carry
the weight of the world

35:40.929 --> 35:42.261
on your shoulders, love.

35:44.432 --> 35:46.632
- (Stifled Laugh)
- We love you.

35:48.269 --> 35:49.635
We love you so much.

35:49.687 --> 35:51.270
- Mm.
- You okay?

35:51.305 --> 35:52.838
- Mm-hmm.
- (All Giggling)

35:56.277 --> 35:57.643
(Line Ringing)

35:57.695 --> 35:59.278
EMMA ON PHONE: Hey.

35:59.313 --> 36:01.480
Hey, I thought you were
coming over. What happened?

36:01.532 --> 36:05.234
I know, I just have
so much packing to do

36:05.286 --> 36:07.403
before we leave tomorrow.

36:07.455 --> 36:10.206
So, I'm not gonna see you before you go?

36:10.241 --> 36:12.208
I'm sorry.

36:13.494 --> 36:15.244
Well, I miss you.

36:16.414 --> 36:18.380
I miss you, too.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.583
I'll call you when we get there.

36:20.585 --> 36:22.418
Okay. I love...

36:22.470 --> 36:23.586
(Clicks)

36:23.638 --> 36:25.221
(Whispers)... you.

36:37.435 --> 36:39.235
Did Mamas talk to you
about the tree house?

36:40.271 --> 36:41.687
Uh, yeah.

36:41.739 --> 36:45.608
Yeah, but Gabe thinks that he
can get all the materials donated,

36:45.660 --> 36:48.661
and Emma told me about this
Summer of Service grant.

36:48.696 --> 36:51.247
So, if I'm a senior next year,

36:51.282 --> 36:52.581
Mom says that it could still,

36:52.617 --> 36:54.416
you know, work.

36:59.290 --> 37:02.424
Look, I get that you
were just trying to help

37:02.460 --> 37:05.211
and that it's only
happening because of you,

37:05.263 --> 37:08.631
and I'm gonna need a lot of
help applying for the grant

37:08.633 --> 37:11.383
and... and other stuff.

37:12.470 --> 37:14.520
So, um...

37:20.311 --> 37:23.229
I'm gonna ask Emma to do it with me...

37:26.400 --> 37:27.483
if that's okay.

37:30.321 --> 37:31.350
Well, you already said

37:31.372 --> 37:33.239
that you didn't want to do it with me...

37:34.492 --> 37:36.242
so why are you asking?

37:38.246 --> 37:39.495
Just do what you want.

37:49.507 --> 37:51.423
Uh, so...

37:51.475 --> 37:53.309
I'm feeling pretty stupid.

37:53.344 --> 37:54.677
For what? (Chuckles)

37:54.679 --> 37:56.395
I didn't... I didn't realize

37:56.430 --> 37:59.348
what was... going on before.

38:00.351 --> 38:01.600
What was going on?

38:01.652 --> 38:03.435
Well, you know... (Stuttering)

38:03.487 --> 38:05.271
I wasn't trying to seduce you,

38:05.323 --> 38:06.405
if that's what you think.

38:07.525 --> 38:09.658
Oh. Yeah, okay.

38:09.694 --> 38:12.528
(Laughs, Clears Throat)

38:12.530 --> 38:14.530
(Exhales)

38:14.582 --> 38:17.199
Okay, I was... yeah, I was.

38:17.201 --> 38:19.618
I guess I shouldn't have
read Fifty Shades of Grey.

38:19.670 --> 38:23.205
- (Sighs) No, I'm an idiot.
- No, no, no. I'm the idiot. I...

38:24.508 --> 38:27.426
I don't know, I thought
that you were blowing me off,

38:27.461 --> 38:29.378
so that's when I...

38:29.380 --> 38:31.213
but then when you
completely didn't get it,

38:31.215 --> 38:34.383
that's when I made up
that ex-boyfriend story.

38:34.385 --> 38:36.385
I wasn't trying to blow you off, really.

38:36.387 --> 38:37.603
(Stuttering)

38:37.638 --> 38:39.605
I just think if you knew
certain things about me,

38:39.640 --> 38:42.358
you wouldn't want to date me.

38:42.393 --> 38:45.611
Sounds serious. What,
did you kill someone?

38:47.398 --> 38:49.531
No, I, um... I...

38:49.567 --> 38:52.234
- got into Juilliard.
- Oh, my God.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.236
Yeah, and then I lost my spot,

38:54.288 --> 38:55.654
because I needed money,

38:55.706 --> 38:57.573
so I took the SATs for someone,

38:57.625 --> 38:59.408
which I knew was wrong.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.293
Then I got caught,

39:01.329 --> 39:03.212
so I'm an idiot.

39:04.415 --> 39:07.416
Yeah, you made a
mistake. A huge mistake.

39:07.418 --> 39:09.501
- Yeah, I know.
- Like a huge mistake.

39:09.553 --> 39:12.421
Yeah. I... I know.

39:12.423 --> 39:14.506
Well, we all make mistakes.

39:14.558 --> 39:17.309
That doesn't mean I
don't want to date you.

39:17.345 --> 39:20.646
I mean, if you want to date
me, which maybe you don't?

39:20.681 --> 39:25.267
No, I... I do wanna date you.

39:25.269 --> 39:26.518
I mean, I'm kind of glad

39:26.570 --> 39:30.239
there's no ex-boyfriend around.

39:30.274 --> 39:32.274
At least one you're
still hooking up with.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.610
Okay then.
