04:54.925 --> 04:56.301
What the hell?

05:02.223 --> 05:03.349
Hey.

05:09.429 --> 05:11.849
You know which side of the border
you are on?

05:12.850 --> 05:14.266
You got a name for it?

05:16.310 --> 05:21.773
Guess... someone must
have cut your tongue off.

05:24.317 --> 05:25.651
Either that, or...

05:28.278 --> 05:30.322
Or has something

05:31.698 --> 05:33.033
To hide.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.371
As far as I can tell...

05:41.915 --> 05:43.707
You hear me plain enough.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.385
Walter Henderson.

05:58.554 --> 06:01.140
Now I want to ask you one last question.

06:03.266 --> 06:05.017
You see this here card?

06:06.435 --> 06:07.561
Is this you?

06:09.688 --> 06:11.357
Or a relative of yours?

06:14.818 --> 06:17.655
Well, I'm going to call up this number.

06:18.072 --> 06:21.240
And see if they can tell me who you are.

06:21.616 --> 06:25.203
I ain't got beds enough to be putting up mutes.

06:33.417 --> 06:37.381
Operator. I need a line out please.

06:53.354 --> 06:54.438
What?

06:55.189 --> 06:59.191
What, can you... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

07:01.819 --> 07:03.112
Where the hell is that?

07:05.114 --> 07:06.365
Oh, OK, alright.

07:06.824 --> 07:10.534
Yeah, OK, I'll be there as fast as I can.

07:11.201 --> 07:13.495
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

07:13.954 --> 07:14.788
OK.

07:20.667 --> 07:23.169
Steven, I think you will have to change that...

07:23.461 --> 07:25.880
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's incomplete.

07:26.089 --> 07:27.549
Ann, honey?

07:29.342 --> 07:31.428
I just got the strangest phone call.

07:31.803 --> 07:32.846
Who from?

07:33.096 --> 07:36.807
From some hospital in south Texas.
A place called Terlingua.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.268
They say they found Travis.

07:40.768 --> 07:41.894
Oh, no.

07:43.313 --> 07:44.439
What are you going to do?

07:44.814 --> 07:46.647
Well, I'll go down and get him.

07:47.148 --> 07:48.065
Oh, wow.

07:48.190 --> 07:50.818
Well, what am I going to do?
I can't leave him down there.

07:54.322 --> 07:55.699
What about Hunter?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.326
What am I supposed to tell him?

07:58.701 --> 08:01.494
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

08:02.078 --> 08:03.580
I mean about Travis.

08:12.296 --> 08:14.423
I guess you better tell him the truth.

08:35.775 --> 08:38.818
Ten to Vanhorn 90...

08:39.861 --> 08:41.863
The Alpine 118 south.

08:44.407 --> 08:45.575
Terlingua.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.061
You must be the brother of the mute.

09:20.437 --> 09:22.273
- Mute?
- Yeah.

09:23.649 --> 09:27.027
I couldn't squeeze the time of day out of him.

09:28.695 --> 09:31.030
Must be in a kind of jam.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.326
I don't know, I haven't seen him
in over 4 years.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.537
Is that right?

09:38.788 --> 09:43.040
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in 4 years.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.626
All kinds of trouble.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.920
Bits of trouble.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.422
What do you mean?

09:49.880 --> 09:50.964
Well, down here,

09:52.173 --> 09:55.009
A man gets himself into a fix sometimes.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.970
It costs him a little to get him out.

09:58.470 --> 09:59.930
If you understand what I mean.

10:01.890 --> 10:03.435
I don't understand you.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.521
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

10:08.898 --> 10:09.898
Alright son.

10:10.816 --> 10:13.152
But first I would like to ask you something.

10:14.111 --> 10:18.282
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.411
Car wreck, no...

10:24.995 --> 10:26.288
Not that I know of.

10:27.331 --> 10:30.206
Then he must be mixing
with some hard company.

10:30.916 --> 10:34.627
I'd like to see my brother now.
If you don't mind...

10:35.961 --> 10:37.171
He disappeared.

10:37.755 --> 10:39.257
You mean he's not here?

10:39.966 --> 10:41.676
After I came all this way?

10:42.552 --> 10:44.929
He's been gone since early this morning.

10:46.639 --> 10:49.849
We have his possessions.
Never the less...

10:50.600 --> 10:51.643
Saved them.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.855
We'd be glad to turn him over to you.

10:56.564 --> 11:00.524
Soon, as you take care of our little reward.

12:38.193 --> 12:39.402
Travis, hey!

12:43.906 --> 12:46.450
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

12:54.790 --> 12:56.208
It's your brother, Walt.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.809
What the hell happened to you, anyway?

13:16.809 --> 13:18.561
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

13:29.446 --> 13:31.406
Come on, let's get in the car. Trav?

13:33.242 --> 13:33.784
Come on...

14:27.956 --> 14:29.666
Here Trav, here's your stuff.

14:31.668 --> 14:33.586
Got that back at that clinic back there.

14:35.629 --> 14:37.338
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.

14:37.630 --> 14:39.883
I don't blame you for running out of it.

14:46.721 --> 14:47.763
Look, Trav...

14:48.806 --> 14:50.558
We've got quite a bit of traveling to do here,

14:50.641 --> 14:52.935
You're not going to clam up
the whole way, are you?

14:53.978 --> 14:55.687
I'm going to get kinda lonely.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.443
Trav?

15:03.904 --> 15:07.240
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last 4 years?

15:13.204 --> 15:15.245
Have you seen Jane, or talked to her?

15:18.415 --> 15:20.083
Ann and I are...

15:20.959 --> 15:22.794
We sort of gave up on you. We actually...

15:24.252 --> 15:25.754
We thought you were dead, boy.

16:01.826 --> 16:03.370
This is pretty a...

16:14.672 --> 16:15.923
You OK?

16:25.099 --> 16:25.766
Well...

16:31.395 --> 16:32.938
Well, gee Trav, maybe you want to...

16:33.772 --> 16:35.941
Clean up. Take a shower or something?

16:36.608 --> 16:39.571
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new cloths.

16:39.902 --> 16:41.404
You could use a new set of cloths, couldn’t you?

16:44.407 --> 16:46.075
What size shoes do you wear?

16:48.995 --> 16:49.952
Lets see...

16:53.789 --> 16:55.457
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

16:58.168 --> 16:59.670
So, where did you find that beard?

17:01.213 --> 17:02.172
It's pretty snazzy.

17:06.384 --> 17:09.553
OK, I'll zip into town and zip right back.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.390
I won't be gone long.

17:20.438 --> 17:21.646
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

17:25.276 --> 17:26.736
OK, I'll be right back.

19:19.457 --> 19:20.208
Damn it.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.261
You mind telling me
where you are headed, Trav?

20:26.016 --> 20:26.975
What's out there?

20:34.232 --> 20:35.566
There's nothing out there.

20:38.819 --> 20:40.654
Don't you trust me or something?

20:44.865 --> 20:47.493
I'm just trying to help you Trav, that's all.

20:52.873 --> 20:54.207
Come on, it's alright.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.376
Come on with me in the car.

22:04.017 --> 22:05.977
Feels good to be in new cloths, huh?

22:30.499 --> 22:32.666
Hi, Hunter? It's Daddy.

22:33.834 --> 22:35.793
I thought you'd be in bed already.

22:37.629 --> 22:40.841
Guess who I'm visiting, here in Texas.

22:43.552 --> 22:44.512
Your father.

22:45.513 --> 22:46.931
Do you remember your father?

22:49.516 --> 22:50.517
Not at all?

22:53.936 --> 22:54.937
He was?

22:57.064 --> 22:58.190
Well, guess what?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.817
I'm going to bring him home to visit.

23:16.955 --> 23:18.081
Travis

23:21.251 --> 23:24.587
Do you remember your little boy?
Hunter?

23:27.923 --> 23:29.174
Well, he's with us.

23:30.299 --> 23:33.344
He's been living with Ann and me
ever since you disappeared.

23:35.263 --> 23:36.889
We didn't know what else to do.

23:37.223 --> 23:38.808
So, we just kept him.

23:40.892 --> 23:43.645
One day, he was just standing at the door.

23:44.730 --> 23:48.442
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

23:49.985 --> 23:51.361
He didn't know what had happened to you,

23:51.694 --> 23:53.195
Or Jane.

23:53.696 --> 23:56.991
So we tried everything we could
think of to find you, or Jane.

23:57.908 --> 23:59.994
Tried to locate her, she vanished too.

24:02.037 --> 24:03.789
We didn't know what else to do.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.544
Travis,

24:11.295 --> 24:13.505
I don't know what kind of trouble
you got into.

24:14.673 --> 24:16.341
I don't know what happened.

24:18.009 --> 24:20.887
But damn it, I'm your brother man.

24:22.555 --> 24:24.056
You can talk to me.

24:27.392 --> 24:30.436
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

25:13.389 --> 25:14.933
Fill it with unleaded please.

25:17.936 --> 25:20.729
You know, I'm getting a little sick
with this silence routine.

25:21.772 --> 25:22.982
You can talk.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.658
I can be silent too you know.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.205
I just assumed that if we kept
our mouths shut for the rest of the trip

25:40.247 --> 25:42.082
- Paris.
- What?

25:45.209 --> 25:46.167
Paris.

25:52.132 --> 25:53.133
Paris?

25:54.342 --> 25:55.343
Paris?

25:57.680 --> 25:58.847
Did you ever go to Paris?

26:01.266 --> 26:02.099
No.

26:03.475 --> 26:04.768
Could we go there now?

26:07.563 --> 26:09.148
It's a little out of the way.

26:13.024 --> 26:15.402
Ah, I've never even been to Europe.

26:15.777 --> 26:17.195
Ann keeps on wanting to go there.

26:18.029 --> 26:20.282
Cus, she is from France, you remember?

26:21.072 --> 26:22.532
But we never seem to find the time,

26:22.866 --> 26:25.409
Because my company kinda keeps me busy.

26:40.965 --> 26:41.966
Lets go Trav.

26:45.428 --> 26:46.429
What's the matter?

26:47.138 --> 26:48.222
Where are we going?

26:48.556 --> 26:49.930
We're going to fly to L.A.

26:50.765 --> 26:52.349
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

26:53.684 --> 26:55.811
- Leaving the ground?
- Yeah.

26:56.979 --> 26:58.105
Why?

26:58.481 --> 27:00.231
Because it's too far to drive.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.901
It would take an extra 2 days,
I can't afford the time, Trav.

27:03.234 --> 27:04.402
Why?

27:04.736 --> 27:09.825
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. Come on.

27:29.257 --> 27:30.759
It's all OK.

27:31.301 --> 27:34.180
When I get you home, I'll get you settled
and then you can do whatever you want.

27:35.306 --> 27:38.892
But sir, we can't stop the plane
whenever someone gets terrified.

27:39.059 --> 27:41.852
Don't get on a plane and then
refuse to leave the ground.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.980
Don't do things like that,
this isn't the wilderness.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.399
You're living with people now.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.695
You should have acquired a private plane,
do you know how many people you are detaining?

27:51.987 --> 27:53.154
Sorry!

27:53.321 --> 27:55.949
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! OK?

27:58.783 --> 28:01.327
This is getting a little ridiculous Travis.

28:03.037 --> 28:04.497
Are you going to leave me?

28:05.414 --> 28:07.415
No, I'm not going to leave you.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.710
It's alright if you leave me.

28:11.753 --> 28:15.381
I don't know honey, no...
He just panicked or something.

28:17.133 --> 28:19.801
Well, it won't do any good to try
another plane, it wasn't the plane,

28:20.009 --> 28:21.511
he'll just get off again.

28:22.804 --> 28:25.557
Well, we're just going to
have to drive it, that's all.

28:26.266 --> 28:27.851
Yeah, it'll take a good 2 days.

28:31.854 --> 28:35.148
I don't understand why you have to
have the exact same car you had before.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.816
They are all alike.

28:37.066 --> 28:38.901
All the cars we have here are Birds,

28:39.026 --> 28:41.196
Olds, Chevy’s, and whatever.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.156
- I'm not even sure I can locate the same car...
- I know...

28:44.823 --> 28:48.910
My brother left something in the car,
we are hoping we can search the car and find it.

28:49.244 --> 28:52.372
Oh, well, I'll just contact the lost
and found department for you, if that's OK sir.

28:52.414 --> 28:54.457
No, we have to have the very same car.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.834
Well, I can't do that.
There is no way I can trace the car for you.

28:58.209 --> 29:00.795
Well, why not?
You have the license number
right on your form there.

29:00.879 --> 29:03.381
- Well, yes but...
- Well, just give us the license number
and we'll find it.

29:03.715 --> 29:06.009
But I can't allow you on the lot sir.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.636
Why not? We're already on it!

29:08.970 --> 29:11.555
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

29:14.558 --> 29:17.102
- Travis!
- What?

29:18.103 --> 29:20.481
I don't think we're going to get the very same car.

29:20.814 --> 29:23.940
But I can rent you a model
just like the one you had before, sir.

29:25.150 --> 29:28.111
I need the same car Walt.
How are we going to go in another car?

29:29.946 --> 29:31.863
Give us the number, will you, please?

29:33.156 --> 29:34.740
Come on... pretty please?

29:36.700 --> 29:40.329
Alright, that number is 667DJP

29:40.454 --> 29:42.831
You remember that? 667DJP?

29:43.332 --> 29:45.460
- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes it does...

30:01.305 --> 30:02.264
What's that?

30:02.640 --> 30:03.557
What?

30:04.141 --> 30:05.226
That, what you got in your hand?

30:06.852 --> 30:07.937
A picture.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.729
A picture of what?

30:10.396 --> 30:11.898
A picture of...

30:14.733 --> 30:15.442
Paris.

30:16.610 --> 30:17.987
Paris, really?

30:18.488 --> 30:20.698
Yes, picture of a piece of Paris.

30:21.032 --> 30:22.992
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

30:23.576 --> 30:25.078
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

30:27.121 --> 30:29.330
This is it?
This is Paris?

30:30.249 --> 30:32.084
Looks just like Texas to me.

30:32.251 --> 30:33.627
It is.

30:34.002 --> 30:35.712
Paris, Texas?

30:36.797 --> 30:37.756
It's right here on the map.

30:37.965 --> 30:39.381
There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

30:39.548 --> 30:41.049
It's right here.

30:43.802 --> 30:46.721
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

30:47.763 --> 30:48.848
It's mine.

30:49.682 --> 30:52.017
I know that, but how come you got it?

30:52.893 --> 30:56.480
I purchased it in the mail...

30:57.148 --> 30:58.441
A long time ago.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.777
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

31:02.111 --> 31:04.154
No, I bought the land...

31:05.405 --> 31:06.779
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

31:07.113 --> 31:08.156
Oh, let me see again.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.493
There's nothing on it.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.037
Empty.

31:16.122 --> 31:19.957
Well, why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

31:30.467 --> 31:31.634
I forgot.

31:34.012 --> 31:34.888
Here Trav.

31:42.728 --> 31:45.646
Do you remember
what mama's very first name was?

31:46.481 --> 31:47.648
Marry.

31:48.191 --> 31:52.779
No, I know, I mean, her...
before she found daddy.

31:53.196 --> 31:54.987
- Oh, her median name?
- Yeah.

31:55.906 --> 31:57.866
You don't remember her median name?

31:58.325 --> 31:59.451
No...

32:00.577 --> 32:01.745
Sekinae.

32:03.163 --> 32:04.413
Sekinae.

32:04.747 --> 32:05.873
Spanish.

32:06.415 --> 32:07.665
Her father was.

32:08.249 --> 32:09.334
Yeah?

32:15.298 --> 32:16.633
I don't believe it.

32:18.885 --> 32:20.803
You finally decided to eat!

32:21.845 --> 32:23.763
Eating and talking!

32:24.097 --> 32:26.849
Before you know it,
you will be back in the land of the living.

32:31.355 --> 32:32.521
You want me to drive?

32:33.522 --> 32:35.607
Sure! Think you remember how?

32:36.441 --> 32:37.859
My body remembers.

32:43.446 --> 32:45.197
You can sleep while I drive.

32:46.615 --> 32:47.408
OK.

33:02.422 --> 33:03.881
Well, Trav...

33:04.924 --> 33:06.676
I think maybe you are ready to...

33:07.677 --> 33:09.846
Tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last 4 years.

33:12.471 --> 33:13.723
No, not yet.

33:50.004 --> 33:50.963
Travis!

33:51.714 --> 33:52.506
What?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.608
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

34:12.777 --> 34:14.360
Why did we get off the high way.

34:15.402 --> 34:17.155
Jesus Christ...

34:17.277 --> 34:19.906
I can't even sleep for 5 minutes
without some crisis.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.574
Why did you turn off?

34:25.244 --> 34:28.329
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

34:30.706 --> 34:31.998
That's great.

34:32.291 --> 34:33.958
That's just damn great.

34:34.210 --> 34:37.795
Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert
and a place that doesn't have a name.

34:40.255 --> 34:42.342
I could find the high way again.

35:03.695 --> 35:06.070
Trav, I need to talk to you a little
about Hunter.

35:06.987 --> 35:08.614
How old is he now?

35:08.948 --> 35:11.575
He's eight in January.

35:12.536 --> 35:14.662
- She’s seven then.
- Yeah.

35:16.706 --> 35:19.374
But see, what I want to talk about is...

35:20.959 --> 35:24.629
Well, he's like part of the family now.

35:26.631 --> 35:28.758
Ann and me are like his parents now.

35:30.342 --> 35:31.301
Ann's your wife.

35:31.927 --> 35:33.262
Yeah, you remember her, don't you?

35:34.053 --> 35:36.264
No... Does he think
that you're his father?

35:38.558 --> 35:42.103
Well, Ann told him you were coming.

35:44.228 --> 35:45.814
Well, who does he think I am?

35:46.815 --> 35:50.444
I told him you are his father.

35:51.361 --> 35:52.819
But see,

35:54.279 --> 35:56.071
You've been gone a long time, Trav.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.866
How long have I been gone? Do you know?

36:00.701 --> 36:01.618
4 years.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.330
Is 4 years a long time?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.334
It is for a little boy.

36:12.419 --> 36:13.378
It's half his life.

36:15.839 --> 36:17.592
Half a boy's life.

36:21.385 --> 36:22.762
I remember now...

36:23.721 --> 36:24.597
What?

36:28.059 --> 36:29.727
Why I bought that land.

36:30.102 --> 36:31.436
Oh, why?

36:31.519 --> 36:34.813
Well, mama once told me that...

36:35.147 --> 36:37.691
That's where she and daddy first...

36:38.025 --> 36:39.360
Made love.

36:40.527 --> 36:42.071
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

36:43.447 --> 36:45.532
- Yeah.
- She told you that?

36:45.532 --> 36:46.532
Yeah.

36:48.368 --> 36:52.372
So... I thought that...

36:52.830 --> 36:55.208
that's where I began.

36:55.625 --> 37:00.586
I mean me, Travis Calve Henderson.
They named me that.

37:01.796 --> 37:03.547
I started out there.

37:05.299 --> 37:08.219
- Paris Texas, huh?
- Yeah...

37:12.221 --> 37:14.473
So you think
maybe you were conceived there?

37:16.016 --> 37:17.101
Yeah.

37:17.184 --> 37:18.895
You could be right, Travis.

37:21.231 --> 37:23.359
Daddy always had a joke about it.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.902
What was the joke?

37:27.070 --> 37:29.570
He's... he would introduce mama

37:29.862 --> 37:32.240
As the girl he met in Paris.

37:32.865 --> 37:34.158
And then he would wait

37:36.160 --> 37:39.245
Before he said Texas,
so everybody thought that...

37:39.412 --> 37:42.540
He meant...
He would wait

37:42.623 --> 37:45.251
Before he said Texas
till everybody thought,

37:45.334 --> 37:48.712
After everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, France.

37:49.087 --> 37:51.588
He always laughed real hard about it.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.636
So you live in Los Angles, huh?

37:57.637 --> 37:59.139
Yeah, well we live in suburbs,

37:59.305 --> 38:01.349
But I've got my business in town.

38:02.183 --> 38:03.475
What's your business?

38:04.309 --> 38:06.561
I make billboard signs for advertisements.

38:07.729 --> 38:08.855
Oh, yeah?

38:09.897 --> 38:12.567
You're the one that makes all those...
I love those.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.235
Some of them are beautiful.

38:14.569 --> 38:16.902
I'm not the only one in the world
that make's them, Trav.

38:40.924 --> 38:42.676
Trav? This way.

38:43.635 --> 38:46.554
Nice, huh?
Just been in here 3 months.

38:46.929 --> 38:49.974
I really like it,
but I took a beating financing, I'll tell ya.

38:50.558 --> 38:52.602
Like everybody else.

38:59.815 --> 39:00.941
Hi baby.

39:02.652 --> 39:04.486
- Everything OK here?
- Oh, sure...

39:04.652 --> 39:06.820
We just miss you a lot.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.280
I missed you too.

39:09.573 --> 39:11.408
- Come on in.
- Travis.

39:16.413 --> 39:17.748
My God.

39:18.624 --> 39:22.042
We were beginning to wonder
if we would ever see you again.

39:22.417 --> 39:24.086
It's been so long.

39:25.504 --> 39:27.047
Did you have a good trip?

39:27.673 --> 39:28.965
Yeah, it was fine.

39:32.634 --> 39:33.551
Hunter.

39:46.063 --> 39:47.064
Hunter.

39:47.898 --> 39:49.191
This is Travis.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.413
Hi.

40:07.542 --> 40:08.501
Hi.

40:18.509 --> 40:22.053
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mohabis Desert.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.432
Yes.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.600
Too bad you had to drive.

40:29.643 --> 40:31.061
What happened?

40:32.229 --> 40:34.815
Well, Travis just didn't feel like flying.

40:35.606 --> 40:37.191
Oh, I don't blame you.

40:37.191 --> 40:39.443
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

40:39.526 --> 40:41.361
Especially since we live in this house.

40:42.112 --> 40:45.325
All we hear is planes day in and day out.

40:45.575 --> 40:46.492
I like them.

40:54.999 --> 40:57.043
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

40:59.586 --> 41:00.878
No.

41:02.838 --> 41:06.175
Oh, I thought...
I remember

41:06.300 --> 41:10.262
Jane telling me
that you flew once to Dallas together.

41:10.888 --> 41:12.307
Or somewhere.

41:15.476 --> 41:16.768
Maybe I'm mistaken.

41:37.577 --> 41:40.079
Honey.
He hasn't slept in a bed

41:40.454 --> 41:42.581
Since we started, I swear to God.

41:42.915 --> 41:44.833
I don't think that's even necessary.

41:45.293 --> 41:47.337
Where has he been sleeping then?

41:47.671 --> 41:49.923
Well, he doesn't sleep.

41:50.715 --> 41:52.508
He has to sleep somewhere.

41:53.008 --> 41:54.009
OK.

41:54.509 --> 41:56.761
But I don't think he's even going to use it.

41:57.220 --> 41:59.514
He's got to get tired sometime.

42:04.350 --> 42:06.185
There is a towel for you, Travis,

42:06.394 --> 42:09.105
And some underwear and socks from Walt.

42:11.273 --> 42:12.400
Good night.

42:14.525 --> 42:15.651
Thank you.

42:20.489 --> 42:22.992
OK.
Get some shut eye.

42:23.617 --> 42:24.618
OK.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.246
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

43:37.306 --> 43:38.807
You polished them.

43:41.518 --> 43:43.520
That's very nice of you Travis.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.774
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

43:50.232 --> 43:51.442
Aren’t you hungry?

43:53.069 --> 43:55.404
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

43:56.239 --> 43:57.449
Do you like them?

43:58.823 --> 44:00.033
Do you want some?

44:09.918 --> 44:13.796
Well, there is hot coffee on the stove
if you want some.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.133
Look at that truck.

44:56.709 --> 44:57.835
Hi.

45:33.740 --> 45:35.492
Decided to rough it, huh?

45:35.659 --> 45:36.660
Yeah.

45:37.870 --> 45:39.580
What did you do, spit shine these?

45:39.996 --> 45:41.623
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.919
Do you want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

45:49.046 --> 45:50.255
You can wear them.

45:52.839 --> 45:53.923
Thank you.

46:20.740 --> 46:26.078
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

46:26.453 --> 46:28.246
We will be back this afternoon.

46:28.622 --> 46:31.498
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.291
See you later.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.919
- OK.
- Bye.

47:10.072 --> 47:11.657
- Ann?
- Yeah?

47:11.865 --> 47:14.953
I was just thinking
maybe I can meet Hunter after school

47:15.036 --> 47:17.414
And we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

47:18.831 --> 47:20.416
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

47:22.417 --> 47:25.878
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home mom.

47:27.213 --> 47:29.841
Why walk, everybody drives.

47:30.466 --> 47:31.718
Come on, Hunter

47:31.718 --> 47:33.971
It won't hurt you
once to walk home in your life.

47:34.387 --> 47:36.180
No, no, I don't want to.

47:37.140 --> 47:40.225
Travis, I insist, you are Hunter's father.

47:43.395 --> 47:45.857
And get into the car Hunter.
We are late as it is.

47:50.901 --> 47:52.069
You are mean.

48:55.165 --> 48:57.668
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

49:35.826 --> 49:38.120
I'm very sorry about this, Travis.

49:39.830 --> 49:41.705
It's not easy for him, Ann.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.046
Ann, it's OK, he's in here.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.723
What are you doing?

50:01.307 --> 50:02.308
Driving.

50:03.350 --> 50:04.393
Where to?

50:05.769 --> 50:06.978
Just driving.

50:07.979 --> 50:09.689
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

50:10.313 --> 50:11.314
No.

50:16.986 --> 50:19.528
Hunter. Travis is your real dad,

50:19.653 --> 50:20.571
You know that, don't you?

50:23.115 --> 50:25.451
Dad, when are they going to
make spaceships like they...

50:25.826 --> 50:27.286
Make cars?

50:29.830 --> 50:32.373
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

50:33.374 --> 50:34.542
What?

50:37.962 --> 50:41.257
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

50:41.549 --> 50:43.051
And he wanted to walk you home.

50:44.093 --> 50:45.719
Nobody walks.

50:47.179 --> 50:48.262
That's not the point.

50:49.639 --> 50:51.849
Travis is your real dad and...

50:52.183 --> 50:53.809
He wants to talk to you.

50:56.687 --> 50:58.647
Why? What about?

51:01.024 --> 51:02.944
OK, come on. Lets go have dinner.

51:13.994 --> 51:18.958
Hey Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down
to visit you about 5 years ago?

51:22.211 --> 51:23.044
No.

51:24.003 --> 51:26.171
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

51:27.339 --> 51:28.590
Hunter was about 3.

51:29.883 --> 51:30.926
Don't you remember that?

51:34.764 --> 51:35.763
No.

51:35.972 --> 51:37.974
I remember, we went fishing.

51:39.225 --> 51:40.309
Yeah.

51:41.602 --> 51:43.896
I took some Super Eight on that trip.
And I put it all together?

51:44.230 --> 51:45.604
Thought maybe you might
want to see some of it.

51:46.689 --> 51:47.815
What is it?

51:48.606 --> 51:50.066
Movies. You know, Super Eight?

51:50.858 --> 51:52.443
- Oh.
- Walt.

51:53.194 --> 51:55.154
Maybe Travis doesn't want...

51:56.447 --> 51:57.365
What?

51:59.117 --> 52:02.619
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

52:04.745 --> 52:05.913
Yeah, it's up to him.

52:06.622 --> 52:08.250
Just thought you might like to see some of it.

52:08.625 --> 52:11.003
Movies? Sure.

52:11.253 --> 52:15.005
Great. There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter on it.

52:15.964 --> 52:17.173
I've already seen it.

52:17.841 --> 52:18.925
Well, you have to see it again.

52:20.135 --> 52:22.721
- Come on, help me set up the projector.
- OK.

53:51.214 --> 53:52.507
That’s me driving.

53:53.216 --> 53:54.884
I know, you are going to be good.

57:00.168 --> 57:01.880
Time for bed now, Hunter.

57:02.964 --> 57:05.049
Oh, mom.

57:05.300 --> 57:07.384
Time to go to bed, it's past ten.

57:09.886 --> 57:11.971
- Good night dad.
- Good night baby.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.435
Good night dad.

57:25.816 --> 57:27.735
Do you think he still loves her?

57:28.193 --> 57:30.153
How would I know that, Hunter?

57:31.278 --> 57:32.905
I think he does.

57:34.699 --> 57:35.825
How can you tell?

57:36.159 --> 57:37.952
Well, the way he looked at her.

57:38.536 --> 57:40.246
You mean when he saw her in the movie?

57:41.039 --> 57:43.374
Yeah, but that's not her.

57:44.041 --> 57:45.167
What do you mean?

57:46.794 --> 57:48.420
That's only her in a movie.

57:50.255 --> 57:51.757
A long time ago.

57:53.133 --> 57:55.427
In a galaxy far, far away.

58:33.209 --> 58:34.377
What are you looking for?

58:34.959 --> 58:37.211
I'm looking for a...

58:38.587 --> 58:39.505
The father.

58:39.881 --> 58:40.841
Your father?

58:41.216 --> 58:44.176
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

58:44.552 --> 58:46.136
What does a father look like?

58:46.762 --> 58:48.847
There are many different kinds of fathers,
senior Travis.

58:49.556 --> 58:51.641
Well, I just need one.

58:52.016 --> 58:53.268
You think you are going to find him in there?

58:53.601 --> 58:55.103
Well, I don't know where else to look.

58:55.812 --> 58:58.439
Oh, I see, you want too look like a father.

58:59.816 --> 59:00.816
Yeah.

59:02.067 --> 59:05.194
Tell me, do you want to be a rich father?

59:07.196 --> 59:08.155
No.

59:08.447 --> 59:10.074
- A poor one?
- No.

59:11.492 --> 59:12.661
Than which?

59:13.076 --> 59:13.994
In between.

59:13.994 --> 59:16.580
No, no. There is no in between, eh?

59:16.872 --> 59:18.957
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

59:19.332 --> 59:20.625
Rich.

59:37.098 --> 59:38.682
One thing you must remember.

59:38.932 --> 59:42.684
To be a rich father, senior Travis,
you must look to the sky,

59:42.851 --> 59:44.186
Never to the ground.

59:46.439 --> 59:47.648
Little higher.

59:56.238 --> 59:58.073
No... Stand.

59:58.991 --> 01:00:00.867
You must walk stiff, senior Travis.

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:11.668
Dignity.

01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:29.725
You got it.

01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:52.288
Who is that guy, you know him?

01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:55.332
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:02.255
No... they are both brothers.

01:01:02.338 --> 01:01:05.591
No, they are both fathers.

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:09.885
No... ah, forget it.

01:01:10.261 --> 01:01:12.681
- But both who's fathers?
- My father.

01:01:13.598 --> 01:01:15.350
How they have two fathers?

01:01:15.517 --> 01:01:17.058
Just lucky I guess.

01:01:18.726 --> 01:01:20.310
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

01:03:12.826 --> 01:03:14.159
That's my dad's suite.

01:03:16.078 --> 01:03:17.287
I mean Walt.

01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:19.540
That's OK if you call him dad.

01:03:20.707 --> 01:03:23.377
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was OK.

01:03:29.132 --> 01:03:30.590
What are those pictures?

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:32.884
That's my dad.

01:03:34.637 --> 01:03:36.055
And your grandfather.

01:03:39.932 --> 01:03:41.142
What was his name?

01:03:42.143 --> 01:03:43.227
Travis.

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:44.937
Same as yours.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.523
Where is he now?

01:03:49.232 --> 01:03:50.525
He died...

01:03:51.442 --> 01:03:53.443
A couple of years after this picture.

01:03:54.111 --> 01:03:55.362
In that car.

01:03:55.737 --> 01:03:57.656
- Oh, he's dead?
- Uh huh.

01:03:59.241 --> 01:04:01.452
But can you feel that he's dead?

01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:03.287
What do you mean?

01:04:03.912 --> 01:04:05.538
You knew him
when he was walking around

01:04:05.663 --> 01:04:08.291
- And talking. Right?
- Yeah.

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:11.127
So can you feel that he is gone?

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.590
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

01:04:18.007 --> 01:04:19.967
I never felt like you were dead.

01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:21.802
I could always feel you were walking

01:04:21.886 --> 01:04:25.014
Around and talking... some place.

01:04:25.806 --> 01:04:27.473
I feel mom too.

01:04:28.056 --> 01:04:30.266
- You do?
- Don't you?

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.768
Yeah.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.150
That's me when I was in the navy.

01:04:39.485 --> 01:04:40.653
You were a general?

01:04:40.945 --> 01:04:44.198
No... This was when I was in the band.

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.240
The high school band.

01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:52.038
This is you. I like this picture.
Look at that.

01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:54.040
That is really wild.

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:57.291
That's weird when it,
when there is water in between

01:04:57.291 --> 01:05:00.252
And then it turns into nothing.

01:05:01.879 --> 01:05:03.088
That's a great picture.

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:05.757
And this is my mom.

01:05:07.675 --> 01:05:08.717
Your grandmother.

01:05:14.432 --> 01:05:15.475
I didn't know.

01:05:19.521 --> 01:05:20.688
It just seems that...

01:05:21.063 --> 01:05:24.066
Everything has changed between us so fast.

01:05:24.149 --> 01:05:26.275
Ever since Travis came.

01:05:26.567 --> 01:05:27.777
What's changed?

01:05:29.946 --> 01:05:31.155
I'm just afraid.

01:05:32.949 --> 01:05:34.323
Afraid of Travis?

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:36.117
No...

01:05:36.992 --> 01:05:38.494
Then what?

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.790
Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.045
We're not going to loose Hunter.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.090
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:55.426
It's almost as if you wanted them to leave.

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:58.388
- Who?
- Hunter.

01:05:59.638 --> 01:06:01.807
You know what I'm talking about.

01:06:02.182 --> 01:06:05.392
You keep promoting this
father son business between...

01:06:05.851 --> 01:06:07.352
It's not business.

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:11.565
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

01:06:12.522 --> 01:06:13.773
That's a fact.

01:06:14.315 --> 01:06:15.859
You've known that all along.

01:06:17.527 --> 01:06:19.363
Travis happens to be my brother.

01:06:19.697 --> 01:06:20.781
I know he is.

01:06:21.115 --> 01:06:23.199
Well, what's this promotion bull shit?

01:06:23.533 --> 01:06:25.033
You want us to go on pretending...

01:06:25.367 --> 01:06:27.828
That we are the parents
of my brother's son?

01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:30.289
Well, how long do you want Hunter
to buy that?

01:06:30.622 --> 01:06:32.875
I was never pretending.

01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:37.004
I love him, just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

01:06:38.588 --> 01:06:39.797
So do I.

01:06:50.555 --> 01:06:51.640
Hi Ann.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.225
Hi Travis.

01:06:53.934 --> 01:06:55.895
You don't sleep much, do you?

01:07:05.903 --> 01:07:07.196
Travis.

01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:10.491
There is something I have to tell you.

01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:12.493
I was not going to,

01:07:12.826 --> 01:07:16.329
Because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

01:07:17.455 --> 01:07:20.290
I never even told Walt, or Hunter.

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:23.210
What is it?

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.798
After Hunter came to live with us,

01:07:29.548 --> 01:07:30.966
Jane used to call.

01:07:32.635 --> 01:07:34.512
Asking about him.

01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:39.139
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.099
Did she ask about me?

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.521
Yes. In the beginning.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.151
Where did she call from?

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:55.195
Places in Texas.

01:07:55.529 --> 01:07:56.947
What places?

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:02.370
Let me finish, Travis.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:08.499
After what happened
between you and Jane...

01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:12.628
She decided Hunter should be with us.

01:08:14.213 --> 01:08:17.006
She said she couldn't be a mother to him anymore.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.183
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:43.898
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm...

01:08:44.064 --> 01:08:46.402
Hiding something from you anymore.

01:08:52.242 --> 01:08:53.493
She was young...

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.710
She wanted something,

01:09:00.835 --> 01:09:03.087
But I just couldn't figure out what it was.

01:09:10.138 --> 01:09:12.850
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

01:09:21.734 --> 01:09:24.529
A little more than a year ago
she stopped calling.

01:09:25.113 --> 01:09:27.200
I haven't heard from her since then.

01:09:28.868 --> 01:09:29.868
Nothing?

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:32.538
Not a word.

01:09:33.999 --> 01:09:35.585
But on the last call,

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:40.216
She asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:43.426
A bank account?

01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:46.098
All I know about Jane now is...

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:48.809
She goes to this bank.

01:09:49.392 --> 01:09:51.645
On the 5th of each month...

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.315
And wires money for Hunter.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.115
Jane, still sends him money.

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:06.996
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes 50, or 5...

01:10:07.998 --> 01:10:09.667
For Hunter's future.

01:10:10.584 --> 01:10:12.838
I had the bank trace the wire.

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:15.882
It comes from a bank in Huston.

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:17.884
What bank?

01:10:19.303 --> 01:10:22.098
I wrote it down if you want it.

01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:26.770
What's the date today?

01:10:27.312 --> 01:10:28.939
The first of November.

01:10:34.696 --> 01:10:37.449
I don't think we should do that. You're right.

01:10:40.954 --> 01:10:42.581
I meant the other thing.

01:11:02.479 --> 01:11:06.692
You will all be caught
with your diapers down.

01:11:07.067 --> 01:11:08.694
That is a promise!

01:11:09.236 --> 01:11:13.201
I give you this promise on my mother's head!

01:11:13.743 --> 01:11:19.458
For right here today,
standing on the very head of my mother.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.419
Which is how a god treats her.

01:11:22.836 --> 01:11:26.467
Which everybody who wasn't bought
in a fucking store.

01:11:26.801 --> 01:11:31.222
Wanna know and understand
to the very letter what death holds.

01:11:33.058 --> 01:11:35.685
They will invade you in your beds,

01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:39.357
They will snap you from your hot tubs.

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:44.445
They will pluck you right
out of your expensive sports cars.

01:11:45.238 --> 01:11:47.450
There is no where.

01:11:49.452 --> 01:11:51.121
Absolutely no where...

01:11:51.621 --> 01:11:54.166
In this God forsaken valley.

01:11:55.126 --> 01:11:59.756
I'm talking about from the rage
of my voice right here...

01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:03.260
Clear out to the goddamn
Mojave desert.

01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:07.515
And beyond that.
Clear up this mess though.

01:12:09.267 --> 01:12:12.478
For everywhere else in the valley
always had a sona.

01:12:13.689 --> 01:12:16.775
None of that area will be
called the safety zone.

01:12:17.443 --> 01:12:19.530
There will be no safety zone.

01:12:19.864 --> 01:12:21.782
I can guarantee this safety zone...

01:12:21.866 --> 01:12:23.617
Will be eliminated,

01:12:23.784 --> 01:12:25.327
Eradicated.

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:30.750
You will all be exerdited
to the land of no return.

01:12:31.585 --> 01:12:34.130
It's eradication to no where.

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:37.383
And if you think that's going to be fun,

01:12:37.925 --> 01:12:40.053
You've got another thing coming.

01:12:42.222 --> 01:12:44.391
They made me a slime bucket.

01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:48.938
But believe me,
I know what the hell I'm talking about.

01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:51.150
I'm not crazy.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:55.864
And don't say I didn't warn you.
I warned you.

01:12:56.281 --> 01:12:57.866
I warned all of you.

01:13:09.338 --> 01:13:11.089
Thought you were afraid of heights.

01:13:11.757 --> 01:13:14.385
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

01:13:15.178 --> 01:13:16.930
Oh, yeah? Well then just don't look down.

01:13:20.643 --> 01:13:23.312
To bad the things don't look
the same on the ground.

01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:25.232
What do you mean?

01:13:27.527 --> 01:13:28.945
Things are clearer up here.

01:13:30.488 --> 01:13:31.989
Might clear things up.

01:13:32.156 --> 01:13:34.660
Yeah, I had a talk with Ann last night.

01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:36.954
Yeah, she is pretty upset.

01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:39.331
Yeah, I know.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.377
I'm going to leave.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.088
- What?
- I'm leaving.

01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:49.426
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

01:13:49.552 --> 01:13:51.846
- I know that.
- Well, what good is that going to do?

01:13:51.846 --> 01:13:53.598
- I wanna...
- That's not going to solve anything.

01:13:54.516 --> 01:13:56.434
I'm going to go find Jane.

01:13:57.979 --> 01:13:59.272
How you going to do that?

01:13:59.857 --> 01:14:02.025
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.278
I tried to find her, I tried everything,
I couldn't find her.

01:14:04.611 --> 01:14:07.157
Now, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

01:14:07.323 --> 01:14:08.283
What make's you so sure?

01:14:08.616 --> 01:14:10.034
Oh, I just know.

01:14:10.702 --> 01:14:11.911
Can we go down now?

01:14:12.036 --> 01:14:15.541
No! God damn it!

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:18.210
You tell me what happened Travis!

01:14:18.627 --> 01:14:20.088
I'm sick of this fucking mystery!

01:14:20.464 --> 01:14:22.090
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid...

01:14:22.174 --> 01:14:23.758
Ever since I picked you up in the desert.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.929
Now you tell me what happened,
with you and Jane!

01:14:27.972 --> 01:14:28.806
Shit!

01:14:30.434 --> 01:14:32.519
I know it's none of my business.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.816
Uh, well, I need to take...

01:14:38.026 --> 01:14:40.154
Money, credit cards.

01:14:40.654 --> 01:14:42.239
Alright, sure, you can have them.

01:14:42.406 --> 01:14:43.532
You know you'll get it back.

01:14:43.824 --> 01:14:45.367
Oh, forget that. You can have them.

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.204
I want to find her, Walt.

01:15:13.401 --> 01:15:14.570
Hunter!

01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:25.874
That your car?

01:15:29.838 --> 01:15:32.340
Yup! Come on!

01:15:34.093 --> 01:15:35.303
Radical.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.904
This is not bad stuff.

01:15:52.906 --> 01:15:54.909
Ann puts it in lunch everyday.

01:15:55.243 --> 01:15:58.204
Lavash, Ki, Ri. Sticky.

01:15:58.496 --> 01:15:59.873
Lavash, what?

01:16:02.042 --> 01:16:03.627
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:05.629
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

01:16:07.089 --> 01:16:08.467
I like it.

01:16:10.678 --> 01:16:12.346
- Dad.
- Yap?

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.600
Where did you go all that time?

01:16:18.061 --> 01:16:19.313
Mexico.

01:16:19.938 --> 01:16:21.357
How come?

01:16:23.193 --> 01:16:24.903
I didn't know where else to go.

01:16:27.238 --> 01:16:28.532
Where did mom go?

01:16:30.451 --> 01:16:31.494
I don't know.

01:16:32.453 --> 01:16:34.079
But right now, she is somewhere in Huston.

01:16:34.706 --> 01:16:36.458
That's where the space center is.

01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.508
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

01:16:43.509 --> 01:16:44.801
I have to go away now.

01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:46.470
Why?

01:16:47.597 --> 01:16:48.848
Because I'm going to find her.

01:16:49.098 --> 01:16:52.227
What about me, you just found me.
Can I come with?

01:16:57.399 --> 01:16:58.442
What about Walt and Ann?

01:16:59.485 --> 01:17:01.363
We would never come back here?

01:17:01.738 --> 01:17:02.989
Sure, but...

01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:05.158
I don't know when.

01:17:15.296 --> 01:17:16.548
I want to come with.

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.512
I want to find her too.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:23.389
When do we go?

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:29.813
Right now.

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:31.773
Then, come on, lets go.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.027
First we have to stop
to get supplies for the trip.

01:17:35.111 --> 01:17:35.945
OK.

01:17:51.589 --> 01:17:53.340
We got to buy jackets, tee shirts,

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.385
Tooth brushes, stuff like that.

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:57.387
Maybe even walky talkies.

01:17:57.888 --> 01:17:59.347
Talkies of course.

01:17:59.973 --> 01:18:01.057
Just in case.

01:18:10.861 --> 01:18:12.196
Do you know what?

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.697
What?

01:18:15.284 --> 01:18:18.747
This whole galaxy, the whole universe...

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.877
Used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

01:18:23.794 --> 01:18:26.297
- And you know what happened?
- What?

01:18:27.131 --> 01:18:29.676
It went "Phchue..."
and blew up.

01:18:30.052 --> 01:18:33.347
All the spark, flying every place,

01:18:33.639 --> 01:18:35.475
In space...

01:18:36.351 --> 01:18:38.269
It was just gas. It was flowing around.

01:18:38.645 --> 01:18:39.646
The earth was?

01:18:39.979 --> 01:18:41.982
Yeah, the earth was really gas.

01:18:42.358 --> 01:18:45.736
And the sun formed, and it was so hot...

01:18:46.028 --> 01:18:50.534
That the earth just formed
into one hard ball.

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:53.663
Of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

01:18:54.455 --> 01:18:56.416
So there was sea animals and...

01:18:56.458 --> 01:19:00.170
Under the water,
a volcano went..."Pachooo"

01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:03.341
And... The hot lava hit the water...

01:19:03.424 --> 01:19:06.427
And formed rock to make land.

01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:20.735
If you want to make a collect call,

01:19:21.027 --> 01:19:22.864
You dial the operator and tell her that...

01:19:22.989 --> 01:19:24.074
I know.

01:19:24.449 --> 01:19:26.827
Good, then call Walt and Ann.

01:19:27.202 --> 01:19:28.161
Why?

01:19:28.746 --> 01:19:30.582
Because, so they don't worry about you,

01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:31.708
So they know where you are.

01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:33.668
But what am I going to say?

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.044
Just tell them the truth.

01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:38.799
Tell them that you are with me,
and on to Texas.

01:19:39.592 --> 01:19:41.135
They are going to flip out.

01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:44.139
No... but you can handle it.

01:19:44.264 --> 01:19:45.348
OK?

01:19:45.599 --> 01:19:47.058
Why can't you do it?

01:19:47.434 --> 01:19:48.978
I can't do it.

01:19:50.396 --> 01:19:51.480
Why?

01:19:51.606 --> 01:19:53.858
Because it has to be you.

01:19:56.821 --> 01:19:59.324
Oh, jeez...

01:19:59.741 --> 01:20:01.701
Why can't he do anything?

01:20:07.917 --> 01:20:09.502
- Hello.
- Hi dad.

01:20:09.711 --> 01:20:11.254
Hunter. Where are you?

01:20:11.588 --> 01:20:14.090
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

01:20:17.845 --> 01:20:20.306
Yeah, yeah. Hunter, just listen to me now.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.809
Where are you, exactly?

01:20:25.437 --> 01:20:27.022
St. Vernidino?

01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:30.444
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in St. Vernidino?

01:20:30.986 --> 01:20:31.862
Wait a minute honey.

01:20:32.029 --> 01:20:33.697
- How did...
- Let me talk to him.

01:20:34.907 --> 01:20:36.034
Hunter.

01:20:36.826 --> 01:20:38.245
Are you alright?

01:20:38.453 --> 01:20:39.538
Yeah.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.581
What are you doing?

01:20:44.001 --> 01:20:45.753
With Travis?

01:20:48.381 --> 01:20:49.967
Why are you going?

01:20:52.719 --> 01:20:56.516
Tell me where you are Hunter.
Just tell me where you are.

01:20:58.518 --> 01:21:00.228
What's the name of it?

01:21:01.688 --> 01:21:02.774
Oh, my god.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.068
Hunter.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:08.530
You tell Travis, to turn around...

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:11.450
And come back right now.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.327
Do you understand me?

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:15.454
Let me talk to him.

01:21:16.832 --> 01:21:18.292
What should I do?

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:21.044
Just hang up.

01:21:23.798 --> 01:21:25.717
Bye mom. Got to go now.

01:21:28.136 --> 01:21:29.137
Hunter...?

01:21:30.806 --> 01:21:32.057
Hunter!

01:21:49.496 --> 01:21:50.497
Did they flip out?

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:52.124
Yeah, she did.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.585
You're not sorry you came, are you?

01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:55.544
No.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.673
Well, you can go back to them
any time you want.

01:21:59.049 --> 01:22:00.091
You just tell me, OK?

01:22:00.425 --> 01:22:01.927
I don't want to go back.

01:22:03.054 --> 01:22:05.640
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

01:22:52.028 --> 01:22:54.489
I'm so used to calling her mom.

01:22:56.784 --> 01:22:58.077
Ann?

01:22:58.828 --> 01:22:59.704
Yeah.

01:23:04.918 --> 01:23:07.212
She sounded so sad.

01:23:10.341 --> 01:23:11.467
I know.

01:23:15.598 --> 01:23:18.059
What do you think mom will look like now?

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.150
I don't know.

01:23:27.486 --> 01:23:28.946
Do you remember her?

01:23:30.032 --> 01:23:33.785
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

01:23:43.505 --> 01:23:44.798
You look happy then.

01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:47.260
Yeah.

01:23:54.101 --> 01:23:55.561
You can keep that.

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:14.708
Night.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:01.514
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:04.728
Traveled at the speed of light
for an hour,

01:25:05.312 --> 01:25:07.480
If he traveled at the speed of light,

01:25:07.814 --> 01:25:10.610
He would come back in an hour,

01:25:10.901 --> 01:25:12.236
He would be an hour older,

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.489
But the little baby would be a very old man.

01:25:17.241 --> 01:25:18.535
Oh, yeah?

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.079
So, how long would it take him
to get to Huston?

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:26.795
Ah, if they were to travel...

01:25:27.504 --> 01:25:29.465
I would say about 3 seconds.

01:25:31.384 --> 01:25:34.012
Ah, over, I didn't get that last part.

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:37.516
It would take them 3 seconds...

01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:39.727
To get from California to Huston.

01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:42.521
At light speed.

01:25:51.157 --> 01:25:53.451
- This is Huston?
- Yup.

01:25:53.993 --> 01:25:56.955
How are we going to find her
in a big city like this?

01:25:57.331 --> 01:25:59.626
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

01:26:00.085 --> 01:26:03.630
A bank. She's going to deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

01:26:07.176 --> 01:26:08.678
This is a bank?

01:26:09.428 --> 01:26:11.348
What kind of a bank is this?

01:26:12.015 --> 01:26:13.475
Looks like a drive in.

01:26:13.809 --> 01:26:16.061
I've never seen a bank like that.

01:26:17.062 --> 01:26:18.398
Me neither.

01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:22.402
There are so many cars...
We'll never find her.

01:26:22.735 --> 01:26:24.822
Oh, yeah, we will. Come on.

01:26:25.155 --> 01:26:28.033
We will split up and then
we will cover more ground. OK?

01:26:28.909 --> 01:26:31.080
Yeah, we could use the walky talkies.

01:26:31.414 --> 01:26:33.291
Hey, now you're going.

01:26:33.624 --> 01:26:35.835
- I'll let you out here.
- OK.

01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:44.846
Can you hear me dad? Over.

01:26:45.555 --> 01:26:47.056
Loud and clear.

01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:49.684
Good.

01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:16.758
Hunter in position one. Over.

01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:20.596
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

01:27:21.555 --> 01:27:23.891
I told you it would be
more than a toy. Over.

01:27:24.224 --> 01:27:26.102
Ten four. Over and out.

01:29:06.472 --> 01:29:08.891
Dad, she is just leaving the building.

01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:10.434
Get over here.

01:29:10.768 --> 01:29:13.606
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

01:29:18.402 --> 01:29:21.948
She's leaving the building.
Get over here!

01:29:22.866 --> 01:29:24.326
Dad!

01:29:24.743 --> 01:29:26.120
Come on!

01:29:26.621 --> 01:29:29.123
Dad! Wake up!

01:29:29.749 --> 01:29:32.670
Wake up! She is leaving the bank.

01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:35.214
Dad! Wake up!

01:29:36.715 --> 01:29:39.344
Wh... Where is... duh...

01:29:40.095 --> 01:29:41.721
I'm on my way.

01:29:42.555 --> 01:29:43.765
Oh, no.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.207
She went that way!

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:07.502
Which way did she go?

01:30:07.877 --> 01:30:09.462
Hunter! Come on!

01:30:28.402 --> 01:30:31.572
Hunter, did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

01:30:31.947 --> 01:30:34.451
It was the right one,
I know it was her.

01:30:34.576 --> 01:30:36.619
Oh, god. We have lost her.

01:30:37.078 --> 01:30:39.457
Can this piece of junk go faster?

01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:43.627
There are 10 thousand cars here,
how are we going to find it?

01:30:43.753 --> 01:30:44.712
I don't know which one is it.

01:30:45.087 --> 01:30:46.631
Go faster dad, go faster.

01:30:46.965 --> 01:30:49.343
Hunter, what color...
the car was red, right?

01:30:49.676 --> 01:30:52.263
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

01:30:57.144 --> 01:30:59.522
Do you see anything?
I don't know what it looks like.

01:30:59.814 --> 01:31:01.941
You'll have to help me look,
can you see it?

01:31:02.192 --> 01:31:03.818
No, not yet.

01:31:06.238 --> 01:31:08.824
- I see it! I see it!
- Where, where?

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.869
Over in that lane, in that lane!

01:31:11.994 --> 01:31:13.121
Which, which lane?

01:31:13.455 --> 01:31:16.583
- The right one!
- Alright, settle down, I see it.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.841
See if it's her. Can you tell?

01:31:25.594 --> 01:31:27.430
I can't tell.

01:31:27.722 --> 01:31:29.808
Wait a minute, there's two red cars now.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.893
Which one is it?

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:34.855
Ah, the right!
The left one!

01:31:35.314 --> 01:31:37.483
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

01:31:44.157 --> 01:31:46.494
- You sure this is the one though.
- Yeah.

01:31:51.666 --> 01:31:56.673
I hope you are right Hunter,
if we are following the wrong car,
we are going to wait a whole another month.

01:31:57.132 --> 01:31:58.092
I'll be eight then.

01:31:58.509 --> 01:31:59.427
You'll be what?

01:31:59.761 --> 01:32:01.430
I'll be eight then.

01:32:07.145 --> 01:32:09.313
Lets get closer, we can wave.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.527
No, no... we don't want to get too close.
We might scare her,

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:15.070
She'll have a wreck or something.

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:19.742
- OK?
- OK. I guess so.

01:32:30.213 --> 01:32:33.718
Well, I wonder where she is going.

01:32:34.177 --> 01:32:36.429
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:38.931
Yeah, could be.

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.643
Looks like a girls car to me.

01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:54.855
Could it be hers?

01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:59.735
Could be... get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

01:33:59.818 --> 01:34:00.611
OK.

01:34:09.456 --> 01:34:12.625
Roll the windows up, lock the doors,
and if anybody talks to you,

01:34:12.625 --> 01:34:16.464
Tell them your daddy’s inside
and he'll be right back. OK?

01:34:16.464 --> 01:34:17.256
OK.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.300
- You OK?
- Yap.

01:34:48.043 --> 01:34:52.589
Sergeant Jojo, call for you, booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:55.635
Come in, no bets,
you guys are going to love this.

01:34:55.802 --> 01:34:58.096
The girls here spend so much time
with a guy that...

01:34:58.346 --> 01:34:59.680
Most of them live alone.

01:34:59.847 --> 01:35:01.850
But it's tough to live alone in a city like this.

01:35:01.934 --> 01:35:03.477
A lot of violent things happen here.

01:35:04.103 --> 01:35:06.271
Stuff like rape, like murder,

01:35:06.522 --> 01:35:08.441
That's why we have a police force.

01:36:08.472 --> 01:36:09.556
Sir?

01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:13.310
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:17.607
It's too early, all the girls are downstairs.

01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:24.574
Please get a ride, cus I'm getting crazy.

01:38:21.836 --> 01:38:23.089
Yeah, who do you want?

01:38:23.422 --> 01:38:27.927
Yeah, I want to see a blond girl
with kinda short straight hair, about 25 years old.

01:38:28.887 --> 01:38:29.846
OK.

01:38:30.348 --> 01:38:32.558
She's coming down,
stay on the line.

01:38:51.581 --> 01:38:52.582
Hello honey.

01:38:55.001 --> 01:38:56.421
Oh, mercy.

01:38:56.838 --> 01:39:00.842
You know, 23, I work 23
of the 24 bids in this place,

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.223
unless I make 24.

01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:08.852
What can I do for you today?

01:39:10.938 --> 01:39:12.231
I have an idea.

01:39:12.982 --> 01:39:14.525
How about water polo?

01:39:16.611 --> 01:39:17.821
Fun.

01:39:20.365 --> 01:39:21.825
Oh, well...

01:39:22.535 --> 01:39:23.661
Tell you what.

01:39:24.036 --> 01:39:26.706
Why don't you just tell nurse Piffs
what your pain is.

01:39:26.831 --> 01:39:28.207
Maybe I can find a cure... hmm?

01:39:28.499 --> 01:39:30.169
Well, why don't you look at me?

01:39:30.502 --> 01:39:32.045
I am looking at you.

01:39:32.337 --> 01:39:35.174
Yeah, but I'm over here,
can't you see me?

01:39:35.466 --> 01:39:38.721
Listen sweet heart, if I can see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

01:39:39.638 --> 01:39:41.724
Well, what do you see?

01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:46.146
See what you see.
Nurse Bibbs.

01:39:46.938 --> 01:39:48.982
Nurse Bibbs and a rubber horse.

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:52.737
Oh, oh, I see.

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:56.408
Thank you Nurse Bibbs.

01:39:56.742 --> 01:39:58.035
Thank you.

01:41:08.284 --> 01:41:09.493
Hi.

01:41:14.041 --> 01:41:15.460
Are you out there?

01:41:17.755 --> 01:41:21.633
Well, I see your light's still on,
so you must be out there.

01:41:27.724 --> 01:41:29.434
It's OK if you don't want to talk,

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:32.021
I don't want to talk either sometimes.

01:41:33.898 --> 01:41:35.858
I'd just like to stay silent.

01:41:42.699 --> 01:41:44.118
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:56.759
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:41:58.928 --> 01:41:59.970
No.

01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.101
Thanks.

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:08.356
Legs get a little tired from standing all the time.

01:42:12.486 --> 01:42:14.321
Is this your first visit here?

01:42:15.614 --> 01:42:16.532
Yes.

01:42:20.204 --> 01:42:23.332
Well, this whole thing must seem
kinda strange to you, huh?

01:42:24.084 --> 01:42:27.170
You realize that I can't see you even
though you can see me.

01:42:28.046 --> 01:42:30.132
Well, that takes a little getting used to.

01:42:35.388 --> 01:42:37.391
Am I looking at your face now?

01:42:47.444 --> 01:42:49.112
It don't matter.

01:43:04.006 --> 01:43:06.425
If there is anything you want to talk about.

01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:08.802
I'll just listen. Alright?

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:13.349
I'm a real good listener.

01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:27.325
Is there something...

01:43:28.618 --> 01:43:30.871
Is there something I can do for you?

01:43:40.632 --> 01:43:42.884
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

01:43:45.721 --> 01:43:47.515
I'll just take off my sweater.

01:43:47.765 --> 01:43:49.475
No, no. Don't.

01:43:50.518 --> 01:43:52.687
Please, please leave it on.

01:44:01.156 --> 01:44:02.241
I'm sorry.

01:44:06.538 --> 01:44:09.541
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:13.420
I don't want anything.

01:44:15.798 --> 01:44:17.843
So why did you come here then?

01:44:27.854 --> 01:44:29.689
I want to talk to you.

01:44:50.964 --> 01:44:53.009
Is there something you want to tell me?

01:44:56.929 --> 01:44:57.931
No...

01:45:03.313 --> 01:45:06.150
You can tell me, I can keep a secret.

01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:20.833
Is it all you do, just talk?

01:45:24.797 --> 01:45:26.548
Well, yeah.

01:45:28.842 --> 01:45:30.302
Yeah, mostly.

01:45:30.969 --> 01:45:32.431
And listen.

01:45:37.062 --> 01:45:38.606
What else do you do?

01:45:49.827 --> 01:45:51.328
Why are you laughing?

01:45:51.704 --> 01:45:52.914
I'm sorry.

01:45:57.585 --> 01:45:58.629
I'm sorry.

01:46:00.297 --> 01:46:02.466
So, what else do you do?

01:46:04.844 --> 01:46:06.638
Nothing, really.

01:46:09.517 --> 01:46:12.437
Oh, well, we are not allowed
to see the customers out of here.

01:46:14.773 --> 01:46:18.903
What if you see them,
do you go home with them?

01:46:20.572 --> 01:46:22.240
No sir, we don't.

01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:28.497
We're not allowed to have any outside
relationships with the customers.

01:46:28.789 --> 01:46:31.500
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want too, can't you.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:34.379
I mean you can go home with them,
if you want to, all these places say that.

01:46:34.546 --> 01:46:38.383
I mean, how much extra money do you make?
How much money do you make on the side?

01:46:51.232 --> 01:46:52.276
I'm sorry,

01:46:52.359 --> 01:46:55.196
Sir, I think you maybe want to talk
to one of the other girls.

01:46:55.321 --> 01:46:57.656
I'll see if I can find one for you.

01:46:57.656 --> 01:46:59.659
No, no, no. No!

01:47:00.327 --> 01:47:01.870
Please.

01:47:04.122 --> 01:47:05.666
Please don't go.

01:47:10.713 --> 01:47:13.675
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

01:47:16.054 --> 01:47:17.430
Please.

01:47:18.849 --> 01:47:20.684
Please don't go, I'm sorry.

01:47:30.403 --> 01:47:31.446
Alright.

01:47:38.746 --> 01:47:39.790
I'm sorry.

01:47:47.591 --> 01:47:48.676
That's OK.

01:48:00.857 --> 01:48:04.151
I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.243
Just relax.

01:48:13.163 --> 01:48:15.290
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

01:48:17.876 --> 01:48:19.253
I'll listen.

01:48:21.798 --> 01:48:22.757
To you...

01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:30.474
I don't mind listening.

01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:41.112
I do it all the time.

01:49:02.805 --> 01:49:04.307
She was there, wasn't she?

01:49:43.353 --> 01:49:44.729
What's that?

01:49:50.987 --> 01:49:52.154
A vacant lot.

01:49:53.031 --> 01:49:54.741
I bought that land
when we were all together,

01:49:55.367 --> 01:49:56.618
With your mom.

01:50:00.332 --> 01:50:03.210
Thought we might live there someday.

01:50:05.546 --> 01:50:06.631
Where?

01:50:07.549 --> 01:50:08.758
Paris.

01:50:09.843 --> 01:50:10.844
Texas.

01:50:11.177 --> 01:50:12.262
Where's that?

01:50:13.931 --> 01:50:15.808
Across the red river.

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:22.274
Do you like it?

01:50:24.193 --> 01:50:25.736
Mean we live on dirt?

01:50:41.297 --> 01:50:44.217
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

01:50:46.219 --> 01:50:47.679
Wait a minute, where are you going?

01:50:48.096 --> 01:50:49.473
To the truck.

01:51:09.789 --> 01:51:11.123
Have another one?

01:52:20.998 --> 01:52:24.044
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

01:52:26.755 --> 01:52:31.219
Would you say, if you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

01:52:31.844 --> 01:52:33.721
What's a fancy woman?

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.039
My mother.

01:52:57.833 --> 01:52:59.418
Not your mother.

01:53:00.711 --> 01:53:02.005
But my mother.

01:53:02.673 --> 01:53:04.967
Was not a fancy woman.

01:53:05.217 --> 01:53:06.760
She was...

01:53:13.059 --> 01:53:17.315
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

01:53:18.316 --> 01:53:19.776
Then what was she?

01:53:20.694 --> 01:53:22.738
She was just plain.

01:53:25.199 --> 01:53:27.034
Just plain, good.

01:53:28.287 --> 01:53:30.163
She was very good.

01:53:30.789 --> 01:53:31.999
But my daddy...

01:53:35.003 --> 01:53:37.005
See, my daddy had...

01:53:37.964 --> 01:53:39.674
He had this idea...

01:53:40.008 --> 01:53:43.888
He had this idea that was kind of...

01:53:45.014 --> 01:53:46.724
Kind of a sickness...

01:53:48.311 --> 01:53:49.270
What idea?

01:53:50.104 --> 01:53:52.189
He had this idea about her.

01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:57.613
He looked at her...

01:53:59.114 --> 01:54:00.908
But he didn't see her.

01:54:04.245 --> 01:54:05.163
He...

01:54:05.788 --> 01:54:07.624
He saw this idea.

01:54:11.253 --> 01:54:15.634
And he told people
that she was from Paris.

01:54:17.677 --> 01:54:19.304
A big joke.

01:54:19.638 --> 01:54:21.433
He started telling everybody all the time,

01:54:21.808 --> 01:54:23.894
Finally it wasn't a joke anymore.

01:54:27.147 --> 01:54:28.775
He started believing it.

01:54:30.818 --> 01:54:31.945
And...

01:54:32.487 --> 01:54:34.155
He actually believed...

01:54:37.076 --> 01:54:38.285
She...

01:54:39.203 --> 01:54:40.496
Oh, God.

01:54:41.665 --> 01:54:43.792
She would get so embarrassed.

01:54:46.294 --> 01:54:47.337
She'd...

01:54:48.506 --> 01:54:49.966
She was so...

01:54:52.803 --> 01:54:54.763
She was so shy...

01:55:43.821 --> 01:55:45.406
Lominos, cha, cha.

01:56:14.566 --> 01:56:15.777
Left, dad.

01:56:31.671 --> 01:56:33.547
Hunter, it's me.

01:56:36.677 --> 01:56:39.888
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you,

01:56:40.264 --> 01:56:41.807
In person.

01:56:42.642 --> 01:56:46.396
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:52.569
When I first saw you, this time

01:56:53.737 --> 01:56:55.030
at Walts...

01:56:57.075 --> 01:56:59.911
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:05.627
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

01:57:08.255 --> 01:57:10.133
You showed me I was.

01:57:13.886 --> 01:57:16.140
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

01:57:19.059 --> 01:57:20.686
Can't come true.

01:57:23.356 --> 01:57:24.941
I know that now.

01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:29.655
You belong together with your mother.

01:57:32.283 --> 01:57:34.577
You belong together with your mother.

01:57:36.789 --> 01:57:39.167
It was me that tore you apart.

01:57:39.834 --> 01:57:42.963
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

01:57:45.132 --> 01:57:47.009
But I can't stay with you.

01:57:47.468 --> 01:57:49.638
I could never heal up what happened.

01:57:50.847 --> 01:57:53.266
It's just the way it is.

01:57:54.851 --> 01:57:57.647
I can't even hardly remember what happened...

01:57:58.356 --> 01:57:59.774
It's like a gap.

01:58:00.691 --> 01:58:03.362
It left me alone in a way that...

01:58:03.737 --> 01:58:05.364
I haven't gotten over.

01:58:06.198 --> 01:58:07.658
And right now...

01:58:08.116 --> 01:58:09.201
I'm afraid.

01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:14.124
I'm afraid of walking away again.

01:58:14.416 --> 01:58:16.795
I'm afraid of what I might find.

01:58:18.588 --> 01:58:20.632
But I'm even more afraid of...

01:58:21.424 --> 01:58:23.552
Not facing this fear.

01:58:24.595 --> 01:58:26.305
I love you Hunter.

01:58:28.307 --> 01:58:30.644
I love you more than my life.

01:58:42.116 --> 01:58:44.703
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:58:50.626 --> 01:58:52.253
Can I tell you something?

01:58:55.006 --> 01:58:57.384
Sure... Anything you like.

01:58:59.177 --> 01:59:00.554
It's kind of long.

01:59:02.306 --> 01:59:03.933
I have plenty of time.

01:59:27.879 --> 01:59:29.505
I knew these people...

01:59:30.299 --> 01:59:31.383
What people?

01:59:33.427 --> 01:59:34.887
These two people...

01:59:40.685 --> 01:59:42.395
They were in love with each other...

01:59:45.733 --> 01:59:47.151
The girl was...

01:59:47.736 --> 01:59:52.075
Very young, about 17, or 18...
I guess.

01:59:53.493 --> 01:59:54.994
And the guy was...

01:59:55.578 --> 01:59:56.956
Quite a bit older.

01:59:58.582 --> 02:00:01.377
And he was kind of raggedy and wild.

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.798
And she was very beautiful, you know?

02:00:07.592 --> 02:00:08.426
Yeah.

02:00:09.219 --> 02:00:13.182
And together they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure.

02:00:14.642 --> 02:00:16.102
And she liked that.

02:00:17.646 --> 02:00:20.984
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was...

02:00:21.567 --> 02:00:23.152
Full of adventure.

02:00:25.155 --> 02:00:28.033
And they were always laughing
at stupid things...

02:00:28.409 --> 02:00:30.245
He liked to make her laugh.

02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:32.872
And...

02:00:35.083 --> 02:00:37.461
They didn't much care for anything else.

02:00:38.254 --> 02:00:41.674
Cus all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

02:00:43.593 --> 02:00:45.429
They were always together.

02:00:46.221 --> 02:00:48.432
Sounds like they were very happy.

02:00:50.435 --> 02:00:53.314
Yes. They were, they were real happy.

02:00:54.898 --> 02:00:55.941
And he...

02:00:56.483 --> 02:00:58.194
Hey loved her more than...

02:01:00.613 --> 02:01:02.490
He ever felt possible.

02:01:05.828 --> 02:01:08.205
He couldn't stand being away from her,

02:01:08.289 --> 02:01:10.542
During the day
when he went to work.

02:01:15.756 --> 02:01:17.258
So he quit.

02:01:18.926 --> 02:01:20.678
Just to be home with her.

02:01:21.554 --> 02:01:24.099
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out...

02:01:25.852 --> 02:01:27.687
And then he'd quit again.

02:01:28.355 --> 02:01:31.317
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

02:01:35.738 --> 02:01:37.824
- Bout what?
- Money I guess.

02:01:38.575 --> 02:01:39.951
Not having enough.

02:01:40.285 --> 02:01:42.579
Not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

02:01:45.041 --> 02:01:47.335
Yeap, I know that feeling.

02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.463
So, he started to get kinda...

02:01:50.839 --> 02:01:52.299
Torn inside.

02:01:56.303 --> 02:01:57.514
How do you mean?

02:01:58.975 --> 02:02:01.143
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her...

02:02:02.144 --> 02:02:04.564
But he couldn't stand
being away from her either.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:08.193
I see.

02:02:08.735 --> 02:02:11.864
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

02:02:13.324 --> 02:02:16.077
Except now, he got really crazy.

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:21.959
He started imagining all kinds of things.

02:02:24.212 --> 02:02:25.171
Like what?

02:02:27.716 --> 02:02:31.220
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

02:02:33.223 --> 02:02:35.601
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.397
Spending the day
with somebody else.

02:02:38.772 --> 02:02:41.275
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

02:02:44.404 --> 02:02:45.447
The trailer...

02:02:50.994 --> 02:02:52.079
Yes.

02:02:53.581 --> 02:02:55.416
They lived in a trailer home.

02:03:10.934 --> 02:03:13.772
Excuse me sir, but were you
in this with me the other day?

02:03:15.273 --> 02:03:16.649
I don't mean to pry...

02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.945
No.

02:03:21.739 --> 02:03:22.657
Oh...

02:03:26.745 --> 02:03:29.039
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

02:03:30.457 --> 02:03:31.376
No.

02:03:32.335 --> 02:03:33.836
Wasn't me.

02:03:34.504 --> 02:03:35.588
Uh huh...

02:03:38.802 --> 02:03:39.928
Please go on.

02:03:43.181 --> 02:03:46.477
Anyway... He started
to drink real bad.

02:03:47.561 --> 02:03:50.189
He would stay out late to test her.

02:03:52.567 --> 02:03:54.403
What do you mean, test her?

02:03:55.487 --> 02:03:57.322
To see if she would get jealous.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.285
Ha... uh huh.

02:04:03.746 --> 02:04:07.167
He wanted her to get jealous.
But she didn't.

02:04:07.584 --> 02:04:09.086
She just worried about him,

02:04:10.130 --> 02:04:11.924
But that got him even madder.

02:04:13.718 --> 02:04:14.885
Why?

02:04:16.345 --> 02:04:17.888
Because...

02:04:19.141 --> 02:04:21.977
He thought that if she never got jealous of him
she didn't really care about him.

02:04:23.812 --> 02:04:27.275
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

02:04:28.234 --> 02:04:29.902
And then one night,

02:04:30.945 --> 02:04:34.116
One night she told him
that she was pregnant.

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:37.619
She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant.

02:04:37.995 --> 02:04:39.706
And he didn't even know.

02:04:40.415 --> 02:04:42.626
And then suddenly everything would change.

02:04:43.711 --> 02:04:46.798
He stopped drinking,
and got a steady job.

02:04:47.674 --> 02:04:49.634
He was convinced
that she loved him now,

02:04:49.718 --> 02:04:51.888
Because she was carrying his child.

02:04:52.847 --> 02:04:56.601
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

02:04:57.852 --> 02:04:59.938
But a funny thing started to happen.

02:05:00.481 --> 02:05:01.690
What?

02:05:02.274 --> 02:05:04.568
He didn't even notice it at first.

02:05:04.943 --> 02:05:06.905
She started to change.

02:05:07.697 --> 02:05:09.240
From the day the baby was born.

02:05:09.366 --> 02:05:11.994
She began to get irritated
with everything around her.

02:05:12.536 --> 02:05:14.246
She got mad at everything.

02:05:15.499 --> 02:05:18.502
Even the baby seemed
to be injustice to her.

02:05:19.087 --> 02:05:21.714
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her,

02:05:22.006 --> 02:05:23.466
Buy her things,

02:05:23.466 --> 02:05:25.803
Take her out to dinner once a week.

02:05:26.512 --> 02:05:28.555
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

02:05:29.348 --> 02:05:32.811
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together,

02:05:32.894 --> 02:05:35.271
Like the were when they first met.

02:05:36.523 --> 02:05:40.361
But finally he knew
that it was never going to work out.

02:05:42.488 --> 02:05:44.281
So he hit the bottle again.

02:05:44.657 --> 02:05:46.868
But this time it got mean.

02:05:47.954 --> 02:05:50.123
This time when he came home
late at night,

02:05:50.456 --> 02:05:53.168
She wasn't worried about him,
or jealous.

02:05:53.919 --> 02:05:56.088
She was just enraged.

02:05:57.631 --> 02:05:59.968
She accused him of holding her captive.

02:06:00.302 --> 02:06:02.138
By making her have a baby.

02:06:04.181 --> 02:06:06.476
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

02:06:07.185 --> 02:06:09.938
That was all she dreamed about... Escape.

02:06:11.148 --> 02:06:14.402
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:16.946
Running across fields.

02:06:17.321 --> 02:06:18.991
Running down river beds.

02:06:19.408 --> 02:06:20.660
Always running.

02:06:21.119 --> 02:06:23.580
And always when she was
just about to get away...

02:06:23.955 --> 02:06:25.248
He would be there.

02:06:25.833 --> 02:06:27.501
He would stop her somehow.

02:06:29.253 --> 02:06:31.172
He would just appear and stop her.

02:06:34.634 --> 02:06:38.263
And when she told him these dreams,
He believed them.

02:06:39.223 --> 02:06:40.641
He knew she had to be stopped,

02:06:40.808 --> 02:06:42.435
Or she would leave him forever.

02:06:43.352 --> 02:06:45.646
So he tied a cow bell to her ankle,

02:06:45.981 --> 02:06:48.942
So he could hear at night
if she tried to get out of bed.

02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:53.783
But she learned how to muffle the bell,
by stuffing a sock into it.

02:06:54.116 --> 02:06:56.577
And inching her way
out of the bed...

02:06:57.161 --> 02:06:58.662
And into the night.

02:07:00.248 --> 02:07:02.125
He caught her one night
when the sock fell out

02:07:02.292 --> 02:07:04.628
And he heard her
trying to run to the high way.

02:07:04.795 --> 02:07:09.008
He caught her, dragged her
back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,

02:07:09.133 --> 02:07:10.676
With his belt.

02:07:12.595 --> 02:07:13.931
He just left her there.

02:07:14.515 --> 02:07:15.974
And went back to bed.

02:07:17.434 --> 02:07:19.479
And lay there listing to her scream.

02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:23.400
Then he'd listen to his son's scream.

02:07:25.610 --> 02:07:30.117
And he was surprised at himself
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

02:07:32.577 --> 02:07:35.289
All he wanted to do was sleep.

02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:41.588
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:49.222
Lost in a deep vast country
where nobody knew him.

02:07:50.473 --> 02:07:52.183
Somewhere without language.

02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:54.645
Or streets.

02:07:56.105 --> 02:07:58.900
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing it's name.

02:08:00.194 --> 02:08:01.571
And when he woke up,

02:08:02.071 --> 02:08:03.489
He was on fire.

02:08:06.452 --> 02:08:09.455
There were blue flames
among the sheets of his bed.

02:08:10.539 --> 02:08:12.374
He ran through the flames,

02:08:13.376 --> 02:08:15.462
Toward the only two people he loved.

02:08:17.005 --> 02:08:18.381
But they were gone.

02:08:21.635 --> 02:08:22.970
His arms were burning.

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.181
And he threw himself outside...

02:08:27.225 --> 02:08:29.061
And rolled on the wet ground.

02:08:32.106 --> 02:08:33.442
Then he ran.

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:37.446
He never looked back at the fire.

02:08:40.408 --> 02:08:41.743
He just ran.

02:08:48.501 --> 02:08:50.544
He ran until the sun came up.

02:08:52.421 --> 02:08:54.341
And he couldn't run any further.

02:08:56.676 --> 02:08:58.428
And when the sun went down...

02:08:59.221 --> 02:09:00.890
He ran again.

02:09:07.148 --> 02:09:09.484
For five days he ran like this.

02:09:11.653 --> 02:09:13.697
Until every sign of man...

02:09:16.742 --> 02:09:18.244
Has disappeared.

02:09:29.675 --> 02:09:31.009
Travis.

02:10:14.228 --> 02:10:15.897
If you turn the light off in there,

02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:17.732
Would you be able to see me?

02:10:25.866 --> 02:10:26.950
I don't know.

02:10:32.332 --> 02:10:33.750
I never tried.

02:10:52.981 --> 02:10:54.192
Can you see me?

02:10:56.861 --> 02:10:58.154
Yeah.

02:10:59.614 --> 02:11:01.033
Do you recognize me?

02:11:03.994 --> 02:11:05.538
Oh, Travis.

02:11:13.130 --> 02:11:15.174
I brought Hunter with me.

02:11:27.773 --> 02:11:29.108
Don't you want to see him?

02:11:32.278 --> 02:11:33.320
Yeah.

02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:47.086
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

02:11:53.344 --> 02:11:55.848
Ann kept sending me pictures of him.

02:11:59.143 --> 02:12:01.104
Until I asked her to stop.

02:12:07.904 --> 02:12:09.322
I couldn't stand...

02:12:10.573 --> 02:12:13.659
The pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

02:12:22.922 --> 02:12:25.549
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:30.514
I couldn't, Travis.

02:12:35.186 --> 02:12:37.772
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

02:12:44.822 --> 02:12:48.243
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

02:12:53.959 --> 02:12:55.711
Well he needs you now, Jane.

02:12:56.587 --> 02:12:58.047
And he wants to see you.

02:12:58.464 --> 02:12:59.424
He does?

02:13:02.845 --> 02:13:03.762
Yes.

02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:11.020
He's waiting for you...

02:13:11.563 --> 02:13:12.522
Where?

02:13:15.901 --> 02:13:17.069
Downtown.

02:13:18.529 --> 02:13:19.738
In a hotel.

02:13:22.367 --> 02:13:23.535
The Meridian.

02:13:26.204 --> 02:13:28.207
Room 1520.

02:13:36.009 --> 02:13:37.760
You're not going, are you?

02:13:53.612 --> 02:13:55.448
I can't see you Jane.

02:13:57.992 --> 02:13:59.411
Don't go yet.

02:14:04.375 --> 02:14:05.710
Don't go yet.

02:14:24.690 --> 02:14:26.150
I...

02:14:28.737 --> 02:14:32.200
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

02:14:37.414 --> 02:14:39.583
I used to talk to you all the time.

02:14:40.209 --> 02:14:41.752
Even though I was alone.

02:14:45.841 --> 02:14:48.426
I walked around for months
talking to you.

02:14:53.432 --> 02:14:56.186
Now, I don't know what to say.

02:15:00.524 --> 02:15:03.403
It was easier when I just imagined you.

02:15:11.538 --> 02:15:14.082
I even imagined you
talking back to me.

02:15:19.088 --> 02:15:21.466
We'd have long conversations.

02:15:23.469 --> 02:15:25.012
The two of us.

02:15:29.017 --> 02:15:31.603
It was almost like you were there.

02:15:35.983 --> 02:15:37.486
I would hear you.

02:15:37.986 --> 02:15:39.696
I would see you, smell you.

02:15:42.073 --> 02:15:43.701
I could hear your voice.

02:15:47.121 --> 02:15:49.416
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

02:15:53.045 --> 02:15:56.841
It would wake me up in the middle of the night
just like you were there in the room with me.

02:16:05.518 --> 02:16:06.477
Then...

02:16:10.191 --> 02:16:12.235
It slowly faded.

02:16:14.363 --> 02:16:16.407
I couldn't picture you anymore.

02:16:20.578 --> 02:16:23.916
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to,

02:16:23.916 --> 02:16:25.709
But there was no one there.

02:16:29.631 --> 02:16:31.550
I couldn't hear you.

02:16:37.348 --> 02:16:38.474
Then...

02:16:44.232 --> 02:16:45.608
I just gave up.

02:16:52.657 --> 02:16:54.285
Everything stopped.

02:16:56.495 --> 02:16:57.539
You.

02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:03.754
Just disappeared.

02:17:10.554 --> 02:17:12.513
Now I'm working here.

02:17:18.314 --> 02:17:20.523
I hear your voice all the time.

02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.325
Every man...

02:17:29.367 --> 02:17:30.995
Has your voice.

02:17:50.519 --> 02:17:52.062
I'll tell Hunter...

02:17:53.103 --> 02:17:54.439
That you are coming.

02:17:58.945 --> 02:18:00.655
- Travis.
- What?

02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:06.495
I'll be there.

02:18:12.001 --> 02:18:12.877
Good.

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:21.346
- Meridian hotel...
- Yeah.

02:18:26.184 --> 02:18:27.395
Room...

02:19:41.816 --> 02:19:43.109
Oh, you little...

02:21:19.432 --> 02:21:20.642
Your hair.

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:22.352
It's wet...

02:21:23.305 --> 02:21:29.310
