WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.771
Bev, you got any fours?

00:03.804 --> 00:05.739
Give you my fours,
you give me your twos.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.208
All right.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.443
That is not how you play gin.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.380
Gin!
Gin!

00:14.315 --> 00:17.051
Well, I can't say
I'm sad it's over.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.053
Hey, uh, listen,
before you guys go,

00:19.087 --> 00:20.688
I need you to clear
your Saturday.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.590
Well, we were all set
to mail a letter,

00:22.623 --> 00:24.592
but I guess we can
wait till Monday.

00:24.625 --> 00:28.096
Good, 'cause this Saturday
is Andi's birthday,

00:28.129 --> 00:30.731
and we're all going out
to dinner to celebrate.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.166
You planned ahead
this year?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.436
Usually first time I hear
about Andi's birthday

00:35.469 --> 00:38.206
is when you're apologizing
to her for forgetting it.
(chuckles)

00:38.239 --> 00:40.574
Okay, I admit that in the past

00:40.608 --> 00:43.111
I have occasionally
lost track of time,

00:43.144 --> 00:46.180
and her birthday snuck up on me.
I've made some mistakes.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.584
This is my yoga mat.

00:50.618 --> 00:54.155
Yeah, you lost it,
and I found it.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.423
Happy birthday.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.728
Hey...

01:00.761 --> 01:02.530
there she is.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.299
Happy birthday.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.501
(clears throat)

01:07.535 --> 01:11.205
"This coupon is good for
one free massage from Adam.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.207
Back or front, your choice."

01:13.241 --> 01:16.277
Fair warning, if we start
on your front,

01:16.310 --> 01:18.279
things will escalate quickly,

01:18.312 --> 01:20.748
and then you can cash in
this coupon.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.821
Did you see the cartoon people?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.223
It's not to scale,
but that could be us.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.524
Yeah.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.230
* Happy...
It was yesterday.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.432
Damn it!

01:38.466 --> 01:41.369
But I'm telling you, things
will be different this year

01:41.402 --> 01:43.537
because Andi told me
they had to be.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.242
Are they gone yet-- Hey!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.212
Hi.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.281
Ah, I'm so glad
I didn't miss you guys.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.517
So are you excited about
your birthday plan?

01:56.550 --> 01:59.253
Ma! I haven't told her yet.
I want to tell her.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.488
Oh, fine, fine.
Go ahead.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.324
It's a dinner!

02:06.360 --> 02:09.197
Y-You already planned
my birthday?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.533
You mean I'm not getting
my own yoga mat again?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.537
I lost it for you
on purpose, just in case.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.372
Well, find it.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.808
I already made a reservation
at your favorite restaurant,

02:20.841 --> 02:21.842
I scheduled the kids

02:21.875 --> 02:23.444
for sleepovers that night,

02:23.477 --> 02:24.812
and-- this is the best part--

02:24.845 --> 02:27.948
the dinner is on
your actual birthday.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.383
(gasps)

02:31.819 --> 02:33.221
That's right.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.191
I'm pretty handsome now,
aren't I?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.893
Yeah, you are.
(chuckles)

02:39.927 --> 02:43.297
We've never gotten to celebrate
on the real day before.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.732
Yeah.
This is so exciting.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.667
We're going
to dinner Sunday!

02:46.700 --> 02:49.370
Yeah-- Ah-ah, nice try.
It's Saturday.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.205
You're right.
You did it.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.240
Yes, I did.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.376
So do you want me to handle
all the logistics?

02:55.409 --> 02:56.844
Yes, say yes.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.349
What logistics?
It's dinner with my parents,

03:01.382 --> 03:02.916
Don and Marcy,
and Lowell and his wife.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.917
It's easy.

03:03.951 --> 03:07.588
She's throwing you
a lifeline. Grab it, son.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.659
So everybody's coming?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.761
Well, I haven't
sent out the e-mail yet.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.995
BOTH:
Oh, no.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.431
I'm sure it'll be fine.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.633
These two already said
they're coming.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.269
Well, we do have
some requirements.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.305
Your father needs to be near
a bathroom, but not facing it.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.973
He-he wants the convenience,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.542
but he doesn't like the
eye contact when they come out.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.780
And, uh, your mother
can't eat on a carpet.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.783
She's susceptible
to static electricity.

03:35.816 --> 03:39.353
I've seen a doorknob make her
fly right across the room.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.324
See? It's not easy.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.293
I should take over.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.361
Honey, it's handled, okay?

03:47.395 --> 03:49.997
I got the private,
no carpet.
Oh.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.832
And the bathroom
is just around the corner.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.569
You think I don't know
how weird they are?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.373
We're weird,
but we're not deaf.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.445
So you really think
you can pull this off?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.781
Because now you're
getting my hopes up.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.385
And if they come crashing down,
they're gonna land on you.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.456
Look, all I have to do
is send out the invitations.

04:15.489 --> 04:19.427
One e-mail and... done.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
(cell phones vibrating)

04:20.761 --> 04:22.596
Something's
happening to me.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.900
That's the e-mail, Joe.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.637
I told you not to put your
new phone in your pocket.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.673
Oh. Send another
one, will you?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.644
*

04:45.619 --> 04:47.555
Jen and I are super excited to
be invited to Andi's birthday.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.424
We took you to dinner
a year ago, and since then,

04:50.458 --> 04:52.893
we've been waiting for you
to call and return the favor.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.664
Until today, dinner buddy.
Hey.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.500
Hey, about Andi's birthday--
Marcy says we can't make it.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.336
She made plans with people
from her pottery class, so...

05:02.370 --> 05:04.438
Pottery class? Those
people are strangers.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.907
I take you
to urgent care once a week

05:06.940 --> 05:08.676
to get a nail out of your hand.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.344
Cancel it.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.812
I can't change Marcy's plans.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.914
I got one boss,
and it ain't you.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.916
You guys have to come.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.386
This is about my reputation
as a husband.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.354
Well, when you put it that way,

05:20.388 --> 05:22.556
we still can't come,
but now I don't feel bad.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.394
Oh, here comes
that mean building inspector.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.895
She always looks
like she's trying

05:27.928 --> 05:29.897
to scare the hiccups
out of someone.
Joy's okay.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.866
We had her and Rudy over
for dinner the other night.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.702
You just met her! No, no.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.704
I got what I wanted.
I'll allow it.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.406
(sighs)

05:38.439 --> 05:40.674
Hey, how'd the
electrical check out?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.943
We all good out there,
neighbor?
Listen,

05:42.976 --> 05:44.912
just because I'm friends
with your wife doesn't mean

05:44.945 --> 05:46.747
I'm gonna let things
slide around here.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.783
If anything, I'm gonna be
tougher on you.
Oh.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.020
So it pains me
to say... you pass.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.557
Hey, uh, Joy, how would
you and Rudy like to come

05:56.590 --> 05:58.759
to Andi's birthday
dinner on Saturday?

05:58.792 --> 06:02.095
Oh, we'd love to.
Just one tiny thing--

06:02.129 --> 06:04.632
I made Rudy a vegan,
but he doesn't know it.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.867
So make sure there's
something on that menu

06:06.900 --> 06:08.469
that looks like meat, but isn't.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
Poor guy,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.108
married to her,
and now she's gonna

06:15.142 --> 06:16.577
make him live forever.
(laughs)

06:17.911 --> 06:19.813
What was that?
What was what?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.582
Well, Marcy and I figured
since we couldn't go,

06:21.615 --> 06:22.683
you would move the dinner.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.151
I can't move the dinner.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.019
It's on Andi's birthday.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.422
So you replaced us?
Yeah.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.790
How can you be so far behind?

06:29.823 --> 06:32.493
It happened
right in front of you.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.428
ADAM:
So,

06:34.462 --> 06:37.831
it's tofu, but you'll paint it
brown like meat?

06:37.865 --> 06:41.502
Well, it sounds disgusting.
Okay.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.904
I'll see you Saturday night.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.640
Was that about my
birthday dinner?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.209
My hopes are
flying high.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.511
(laughing):
Yeah.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.179
Are there gonna
be any surprises?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.714
Mostly for Rudy.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.751
Oh, good. Rudy and
Joy are coming, too?

06:57.785 --> 07:01.622
"Too," "also," "instead of"--
all those fun birthday words.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.524
What?

07:03.557 --> 07:05.759
Don and Marcy can't make it.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.561
Aw, really?

07:07.595 --> 07:09.096
Well, that's not
a bad thing.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.632
I mean, Joy and Rudy
will have some new stories.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.568
We've already heard
all of Don's, you know?

07:14.602 --> 07:17.738
He thought that raccoon
was a cat. Remember? Huh?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.940
He didn't know pickles
were cucumbers.

07:19.973 --> 07:24.111
He forgot the raccoon wasn't a
cat, and tried to pet it again.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.847
It's just, you know-- and
you wouldn't know this

07:26.880 --> 07:28.816
'cause you've never
planned one of these--

07:28.849 --> 07:31.184
but, um, there's a rule
that everybody agrees on

07:31.218 --> 07:34.087
that if one couple can't make
it, that we change the night.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.657
(laughing):
Honey,

07:36.690 --> 07:38.492
that's not everybody's rule.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.528
That's just your rule
because you're nice.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.531
But lucky for you, I'm not.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.499
Okay?

07:45.533 --> 07:49.537
So we are having dinner
on your actual birthday.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.838
Yeah, I-I got
to be honest.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.542
My hopes are losing a
little altitude, okay?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.143
Are you sure you
can pull this off?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.711
Yes. Yes.

07:57.745 --> 08:01.114
So just, look--
sit back and relax.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.052
You are in for a smooth flight.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.256
Uh-huh.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.061
I'm just gonna call Marcy
and figure everything out.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.697
Look, if you pick
up that phone,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.799
you're saying
you don't believe in me.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.968
(sputters)
I believe in you.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.772
Then why are you still
walking towards the phone?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.610
Am I?

08:29.643 --> 08:33.080
Andi, I'm telling you, this
dinner is coming together.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.982
Yes, there was a
little speed bump,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.984
but everyone's cool with it.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.252
He frickin' replaced us?

08:39.286 --> 08:42.923
No. No, we are not
replaceable. We are family.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.258
Technically, I'm family.
You're just the wife.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.895
Sharesies?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.097
We are going
to that dinner.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.999
You tell your brother
we are in.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.668
(sighs) You just made me
tell him we were out.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.903
It was a power move.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.638
We lost. Let's move on.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.907
(sighs)
Okay, okay.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.642
Just one question.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.744
How long will menopause last?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.716
Hey, guys.
Oh, Don, so,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.684
I called the restaurant
to get you and Marcy back in.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.053
I did like you said. I told
the guy it was for Don Burns.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.624
He got all excited and said,
"Don Burns? The Don Burns?"

09:16.657 --> 09:18.659
Really?
No. They didn't care.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.929
They can only fit eight
in the private room.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.164
Look, you got to help me out.
Marcy's all over me.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.200
I tried to hide from her,
but my house is too small.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.603
Look, Don,
there's nothing I can do.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.338
Last night I had to pretend
to work under my car

09:31.371 --> 09:33.841
until she
went to sleep.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.208
Come on, little brother.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.778
Okay, fine. Forget it.
Dinner's cancelled.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.747
No!

09:39.780 --> 09:41.949
I thought we'd just
follow the dumb rule

09:41.982 --> 09:43.651
and do it on a night
when everyone can go.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.653
There, you happy?
Thank you.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.020
All right,
I'm off to the lumberyard.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.822
Okay, good luck
at the dog track.
Thanks.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.093
No. Don't do this.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.895
Rescheduling means
it's never going to happen,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.064
and I already took the tags off
my new outfit.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.201
Don't worry.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.770
I'm not rescheduling.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.137
I just said that
to get Don off my back.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.806
Saturday is still on.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.776
Yes! Wow.
What a roller coaster.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.813
(clears throat)

10:12.846 --> 10:15.115
You really think
you can pull this off?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.984
Why do people keep
asking me that?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.419
Hey, look, all we have
to do is not let Andi know

10:19.452 --> 10:21.254
that Don and Marcy
think it's cancelled.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.724
And it goes without saying
that Don and Marcy can't know

10:23.757 --> 10:25.292
that it's not cancelled.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.894
Or that it is cancelled.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.929
No. That it's not cancelled.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.698
Yeah. It's easy, man.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.268
But what if Joy tells Marcy?

10:35.302 --> 10:38.405
Ooh. Oh, but that's
not gonna be a problem--

10:38.438 --> 10:40.440
they don't even know each other.
See? I planned that,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.876
and I didn't even know it--
that's how good I am.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.713
DON:
I don't understand

10:45.746 --> 10:47.815
why you could sample a
grape but not an apple.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.282
Because it's not a buffet.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.684
JOY:
Don.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.985
DON:
Hi, Joy.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.087
Is this tall fellow
bothering you, ma'am?

10:54.121 --> 10:56.156
For 23 years.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.358
Joy, this is my
wife, Marcy.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.861
Hi, Marcy.
This is my husband, Rudy.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.362
(chuckles):
Hey.
Hey.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.831
I'm looking forward
to eating some steaks

11:03.864 --> 11:05.065
with you at Andi's
birthday dinner.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.700
I hope they're good.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.769
The last few I've had
have been real mushy.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.370
MARCY:
Oh, no,

11:10.403 --> 11:11.404
didn't you hear?

11:11.438 --> 11:12.706
No, Don and I were busy,

11:12.740 --> 11:13.874
so they decided to reschedule.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.075
No, it's still on.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.243
What?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.878
Yeah, Adam sent out

11:17.911 --> 11:20.280
an e-mail today
confirming it. See?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.782
Do you see this?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.283
He is still having
that dinner.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.719
He took us off the e-mail
so we wouldn't know.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.755
We were only
on the first e-mail.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.090
The first e-mail?
This is the only one we got.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.759
No, that is
the second e-mail.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.360
Rudy, do you know
what this means?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.896
When they couldn't go,
Adam subbed us in.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.464
We're just seat fillers.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.966
Hmm.
Rudy!

11:38.999 --> 11:41.001
This is an outrage!

11:42.402 --> 11:43.971
*

11:52.880 --> 11:54.181
What?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.418
I have to ask-- how's it going
with my birthday dinner?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.854
Perfect. Just like you.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.992
And all the organizing?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.960
Easy. Just like you.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.161
Ha.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.997
(both chuckle)

12:10.030 --> 12:11.932
It's funny, 'cause it's true.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.466
Yeah. Yeah.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.235
I'm about to get a lot easier,

12:15.268 --> 12:16.904
'cause I'm going for more wine.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.972
(knocking at door)

12:19.006 --> 12:21.041
Well, fill it to the brim,

12:21.074 --> 12:25.078
because this birthday
is nothing but smooth sailing.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.851
Who was that?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.953
Wrong number.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.528
Seriously, who was that?
Nobody.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.863
I heard knocking.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.231
Oh, that was two old crows

12:44.264 --> 12:45.532
that flew into the door.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.206
What are you doing?

12:53.240 --> 12:55.976
Nothing. I just want
to be close to you.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.912
How about a kiss?

12:58.946 --> 12:59.980
Hmm?

13:00.013 --> 13:01.815
(laughs):
Aw. That's sweet.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.554
Huh.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.824
I was sure you were
hiding something from me.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.093
Me? I'd never hide
anything from you.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.300
Hey, guys.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.870
Oh, look--
the crows are back.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.038
MARCY:
Now, I'm sorry

13:25.072 --> 13:26.439
that you have to see this,

13:26.473 --> 13:29.142
but there are some things
that need to be said

13:29.176 --> 13:32.880
to your bonehead husband
about your birthday dinner.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.614
Why are you two here together?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.316
You don't even know each other.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.819
We're friends now.
Helps to have a common enemy.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.855
He insulted me.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.156
Yeah. And he lied to me.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.992
You said you were
rescheduling the dinner,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.059
and you didn't.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.027
What?!

13:47.060 --> 13:49.196
She chose pottery class
over your birthday.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.331
You were supposed
to change the date.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.066
That's the rule.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.301
That's Andi's rule,
because she's nice.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.036
So that rule
doesn't apply to you.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.041
He subbed me and Rudy
in as seat fillers.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.276
Nobody puts Joy
on the B-team.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.412
I'm not a "B."
I'm an "A."

14:05.445 --> 14:09.049
An "A"! As in I will
kick you in the "A"!

14:11.218 --> 14:14.054
You said you had this handled.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.223
You said it was
all eas like me.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.557
(gasps)
He said that
to you?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.059
Yeah, and she thought
it was funny.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.260
Stay out of my marriage.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.062
I am out of your marriage.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.897
And I'm out of this dinner, too.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.967
Okay, well, I'll
get over it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.969
Congratulations, Marcy,
you're back in.
Oh, no, no.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.470
I'm not coming
to your dinner, either.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.605
What?!
So neither of
you are coming?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.607
We'll do something fun
another time with you.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.477
And we'll have a great time--
because he won't be there.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
(sighs heavily)

14:44.517 --> 14:46.153
(scoffs)
Those two, huh?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.520
(forced chuckle)

14:49.356 --> 14:51.124
Yeah. They're not the problem.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.325
You're right.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.127
We need to remember
to lock that back door.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.029
(groans)

14:56.063 --> 14:57.297
RUDY:
I can't believe your wife

14:57.330 --> 14:59.499
was so mad
she left you here.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.667
Yours did, too.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.236
Well, I can believe
my wife did it.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.939
I've just never seen it happen
to someone else.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.942
Thanks for coming
to pick us up.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.078
Yeah. I needed to get
out of the house.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.346
Andi was so mad
she stopped blinking.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.082
She was just staring,

15:15.115 --> 15:18.185
like a painting
of an angry wife.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.520
Listen, I need people
at her birthday dinner.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.156
You got to help me
out with your wives.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.357
(scoffs) Yeah, you
just picked us up

15:24.391 --> 15:26.026
from a grocery store

15:26.059 --> 15:27.560
where our wives left us.
Yeah.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.197
Did they say if they
were coming back, or...?

15:30.230 --> 15:31.531
Did they even mention us?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.500
Will you two
pay attention?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.568
Okay? I got to do
something about this.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.037
You got to do more
than something.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.072
This is like when
your team is way down

15:39.106 --> 15:40.974
at the bottom of the ninth.
Yeah. You can't
just hit a double.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.010
BOTH:
You need a grand slam.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.346
Boy, I have
never felt more

15:46.379 --> 15:48.448
like a third wheel.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.218
But you're right, what
I need is a big idea

15:51.251 --> 15:53.520
that's gonna
blow her mind.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.288
It'll come to me.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.697
I needed a big idea.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.200
I-It didn't come to me.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.437
You look beautiful
way down there.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.074
So, now nobody's coming?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.209
No.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.612
Don and Marcy got to my parents,
so they canceled in protest,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.248
and... Lowell and Jen said

16:21.281 --> 16:23.150
they didn't want
their first dinner with us

16:23.183 --> 16:25.218
to be on what he called a...

16:25.252 --> 16:27.387
"ruined night."

16:27.420 --> 16:29.156
You know what, for your sake,

16:29.189 --> 16:32.192
I-I think it's a good thing
that I'm way down here.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.097
Boy, that was
a quiet ride.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.565
(chuckles)

16:38.598 --> 16:41.468
Good call not wasting
all your words on the ride home.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.270
(chuckles nervously)

16:44.371 --> 16:46.539
And you're not blinking again.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.742
Honey, I'm so sorry. I...

16:49.776 --> 16:52.312
I don't know what to say. I...

16:53.246 --> 16:54.681
(softly):
Um...

17:01.088 --> 17:02.322
Surprise!

17:02.355 --> 17:04.557
Oh, my God!
(chuckles)

17:04.591 --> 17:06.493
Oh, my God.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.461
You threw me a
surprise party.

17:08.495 --> 17:12.031
That's right. Yeah, I needed
a big idea, and it came to me.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.335
Well, how did you
pull this off?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.370
Well, it wasn't easy
getting them here.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.605
Part of the agreement was

17:18.638 --> 17:20.640
I had to admit to being
a lying bonehead.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.244
You'll see it later.
It's written on the cake.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.313
Oh...

17:27.447 --> 17:29.649
*

17:31.284 --> 17:35.255
Hey, everybody, I would
like to make a toast

17:35.288 --> 17:36.589
to my beautiful wife
Ah.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.291
on her birthday.
Aw.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.460
Everything good that
happens in my life

17:40.493 --> 17:42.295
happens because of you.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.697
Oh.
Thank you. And
thanks to all of you

17:44.731 --> 17:47.234
for getting over how
mad you were at me.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.769
It was our pleasure.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.804
I really enjoyed
how much you begged.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.373
JOY:
Remember that part

17:53.406 --> 17:55.342
where he started
to cry a little?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.413
Your husband is
very thoughtful.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.649
This one here has messed up

18:02.682 --> 18:04.417
every birthday in my 40s.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.686
Wha...?
But you've got
one year left

18:06.719 --> 18:08.455
before I turn 50.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.758
She's telling
people she's 49?

18:11.791 --> 18:14.327
That means she
had me when...

18:14.361 --> 18:15.662
Just let her have it, boy.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.632
Hey, Jen,
sorry it took

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
so long to have
you guys over.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.803
Hey, how about you come over
tomorrow for game night?

18:23.836 --> 18:26.406
What's your pleasure?
Pictionary? Yahtzee?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.809
Boggle?
Or we can do all three,
Pic-Yahtzee-Boggle.

18:29.842 --> 18:34.347
Oh, wow. Uh, well, let me talk
to Andi about that right now.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
We were too interesting.
Mm-hmm.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.387
Oh, here's one I hate--

18:40.420 --> 18:42.422
you're minding your own
business, watching television,

18:42.455 --> 18:45.392
the wife walks in and says,
"There you are."

18:45.425 --> 18:48.328
Mm-hmm. And then
it's good-bye fun.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.330
And hello, Bed
Bath & Beyond.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.901
I seriously think we
should vacation together.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.837
I would not say
no to a cruise.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.339
Yeah.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.442
This is a great
birthday, honey.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.245
I mean, you know,
my hopes were high,

19:05.278 --> 19:07.414
and then they were
real low, and then...

19:07.447 --> 19:10.417
you know, you came through
with this, and it's, like...

19:10.450 --> 19:12.852
(imitates explosion)

19:12.885 --> 19:14.354
Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.189
Next time you offer
to handle logistics,

19:16.223 --> 19:17.324
I'm gonna let you.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.526
I can't even
spell "logistics."

19:19.559 --> 19:21.594
What am I doing trying to
handle them? (chuckles)

19:21.628 --> 19:23.663
Come on. You're on a roll.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.333
Aw.
Can't wait to see
what my present is.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.609
Me, neither.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.612
I-I mean, I can't wait
to see you open it.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.614
Yeah. I know what it is.

19:41.648 --> 19:45.552
Yeah. It's on the truck.
I'll go get it. Here.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.320
All right.
I'll be right back.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.623
In about an hour.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.899
I say from now on we
stand up to our wives.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.302
The next time one of them
says, "There you are,"

20:02.335 --> 20:05.438
we just say, "Not
now, I'm busy."

20:05.472 --> 20:07.307
I'm in.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.575
All right.
I feel strong, man.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.976
I feel good.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.978
Good.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.513
BOTH:
There you are.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.981
Not now, I'm busy.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.686
Not now, you're what?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.255
No, he told... he...

20:24.023 --> 20:26.459
Don, you left me hanging.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.895
I'm sorry, I lost my nerve.
