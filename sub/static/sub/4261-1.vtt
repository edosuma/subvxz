03:02.191 --> 03:04.659
You see? You see
the symbolism of it?

03:04.727 --> 03:06.661
Capital and Labor
destroy each other.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.459
It teaches a moral lesson.
It has social significance.

03:09.531 --> 03:11.624
Who wants to see that kind of stuff?
It gives me the creeps.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.634
Tell him how long it played
in the Music Hall.

03:13.702 --> 03:15.636
It was held over a fifth week.

03:15.704 --> 03:17.798
Who goes to the Music Hall?
Communists!

03:17.874 --> 03:20.570
Communists? This picture's
an answer to Communists!

03:20.644 --> 03:22.544
It shows we're awake...

03:22.612 --> 03:24.546
and not dunking our heads in the sand
like a bunch of ostriches!

03:24.614 --> 03:26.946
I want this picture to be
a commentary on modern conditions.

03:27.017 --> 03:29.382
Stark realism. The problems
that confront the average man.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.385
- But with a little sex.
- A little, but I don't want to stress it.

03:31.453 --> 03:33.387
I want this picture
to be a document.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.389
I want to hold
a mirror up to life.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.391
I want this to be
a picture of dignity...

03:37.459 --> 03:38.681
a true canvas of the
suffering of humanity.

03:38.694 --> 03:39.927
But with a
little sex.

03:39.995 --> 03:41.930
- With a little sex in it.
- How about a nice musical?

03:41.998 --> 03:43.932
How can you talk about musicals
at a time like this,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.934
with the world
committing suicide?

03:46.002 --> 03:47.936
With corpses piling up
in the street,

03:48.004 --> 03:49.972
with grim death gargling at you
from every corner,

03:50.040 --> 03:52.270
- with people slaughtered like sheep!
- Maybe they'd like to forget.

03:52.342 --> 03:55.436
Then why did they hold this one over
for a fifth week? For the ushers?

03:55.512 --> 03:57.537
- It died in Pittsburgh.
- Like a dog.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.548
- What do they know in Pittsburgh?
- They know what they like.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.550
If they knew what they liked,
they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.

04:01.618 --> 04:04.712
If you pandered to the public,
you'd still be in the horse age.

04:04.788 --> 04:05.857
You think we're not?
Look at Hop-along Cassidy.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.950
You look at him!

04:07.024 --> 04:10.289
We'd still be making Keystone chases,
bathing beauties, custard pie...

04:10.361 --> 04:12.295
- And a fortune.
- A fortune.

04:12.363 --> 04:14.490
Of course I'm just a minor
employee here, Mr. LeBrand...

04:14.565 --> 04:16.499
He's starting that one again.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.084
I wanted to make you
something outstanding...

04:18.098 --> 04:19.627
something you could
be proud of,

04:19.704 --> 04:22.137
something that would realize
the potentialities of film...

04:22.205 --> 04:24.901
as the sociological
and artistic medium that it is.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.908
With a little sex in it.
Something like...

04:26.976 --> 04:29.740
- Something like Capra. I know.
- What's the matter with Capra?

04:29.813 --> 04:30.769
<i>Look, you want to make O
Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

04:30.782 --> 04:31.748
<i>Yes.</i>

04:31.816 --> 04:33.750
- Now, wait a minute!
- Then go ahead and make it!

04:33.818 --> 04:35.752
For what you're getting,
I can't afford to argue with you.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.754
That's a fine way to start a man out
on a million-dollar production.

04:37.822 --> 04:39.756
You want it, you've got it!

04:39.824 --> 04:41.758
I can take it on the chin.
I've taken it before.

04:41.826 --> 04:44.260
- Not from me you haven't.
- Not from you, Sully, that's true.

04:44.328 --> 04:46.262
<i>Not with pictures like
So Long Sarong,</i>

04:46.330 --> 04:48.264
<i>Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft,
Ants in Your Plants of 1939...</i>

04:48.332 --> 04:51.267
But they weren't about tramps,
lockouts, sweatshops,

04:51.335 --> 04:54.771
people eating garbage in alleys
and living in piano boxes and ash cans.

04:54.839 --> 04:56.774
- And phooey!
- They're about nice, clean young people...

04:56.842 --> 04:58.776
who fell in love...
with laughter and music and legs.

04:58.844 --> 05:00.778
<i>Now take that scene in
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft...</i>

05:00.846 --> 05:02.780
But you don't realize
conditions have changed.

05:02.848 --> 05:04.782
There isn't any work.
There isn't any food.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.784
- These are troublous times.
- What do you know about trouble?

05:06.852 --> 05:08.786
- What do I know about trouble?
- Yes, what do you know about trouble?

05:08.854 --> 05:09.809
What do you mean, what
do I know about trouble?

05:09.822 --> 05:10.788
Just what
I'm saying.

05:10.856 --> 05:12.789
You want to make a picture
about garbage cans...

05:12.857 --> 05:14.791
When did you eat
your last meal out of one?

05:14.859 --> 05:16.793
- What's that got to do with it?
- He's asking you.

05:16.861 --> 05:18.795
You want an epic about misery...

05:18.863 --> 05:20.798
you want to show hungry people
sleeping in doorways.

05:20.866 --> 05:22.561
With newspapers around them.

05:22.634 --> 05:24.568
You want to grind
10,000 feet of hard luck,

05:24.636 --> 05:26.570
- and all I'm asking you is, what
do you know about hard luck? - Yes!

05:26.638 --> 05:29.072
- What do you mean? Don't you think I've...
- No.

05:29.141 --> 05:31.075
- What?
- You have not.

05:31.143 --> 05:33.077
I sold newspapers
till I was 20,

05:33.145 --> 05:35.079
then I worked in a shoe store and
put myself through law school at night.

05:35.147 --> 05:37.081
- Where were you at 20?
- I was in college.

05:37.149 --> 05:39.413
When I was 13 I supported three sisters,
two brothers and a widowed mother.

05:39.484 --> 05:41.418
- Where were you at 13?
- I was in boarding school.

05:41.486 --> 05:43.920
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully.

05:43.989 --> 05:46.083
That's the reason your pictures have
been so light, so cheerful, so inspiring.

05:46.159 --> 05:48.093
They don't stink with messages.

05:48.161 --> 05:50.095
That's why I paid you
500 a week when you were 24.

05:50.163 --> 05:52.097
- 750 at 25.
- 1,000 when you were 26.

05:52.165 --> 05:54.759
- When I was 26, I was getting 18.
- 2,000 at 27.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.098
<i>- I was getting 25 then.
- 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday.</i>

05:57.170 --> 05:59.104
<i>4,000 after Ants in Your Plants.</i>

05:59.172 --> 06:01.106
I suppose you're trying to tell me
I don't know what trouble is.

06:01.174 --> 06:03.108
- Yes!
- In a nice way, Sully.

06:03.176 --> 06:05.643
You're absolutely right.
I haven't any idea what it is.

06:05.710 --> 06:07.940
People always like what they don't
know anything about.

06:08.013 --> 06:11.609
I had a lot of nerve wanting to make
a picture about human suffering.

06:11.684 --> 06:15.780
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully,
but then, you are anyway.

06:15.855 --> 06:18.790
<i>How about making
Ants in Your Plants of 1941?</i>

06:18.858 --> 06:20.951
- You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin...
- Maybe Bing Crosby.

06:21.027 --> 06:22.892
- The Abbott Dancers.
- Maybe Jack Benny and Rochester.

06:22.962 --> 06:24.896
- A big-name band.
- What?

06:24.964 --> 06:27.398
<i>Oh, no. I want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

06:27.466 --> 06:29.400
But I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do first.

06:29.468 --> 06:31.402
I'm going down to wardrobe
to get some old clothes,

06:31.470 --> 06:33.404
- some old shoes,
- Huh?

06:33.472 --> 06:34.507
and I'm gonna start out
with ten cents in my pocket.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.566
What?

06:35.642 --> 06:37.576
I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm not coming back...

06:37.644 --> 06:39.578
- till I know what trouble is.
- What?

06:39.646 --> 06:41.580
Don't worry, you can
take me off salary.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.912
Who's talking about
taking you off salary?

06:43.984 --> 06:46.418
- So long. Thanks for the idea.
- Wait! Don't be so impulsive.

06:46.486 --> 06:48.420
- How soon will you be back?
- I don't know.

06:48.488 --> 06:50.422
Maybe a week, maybe a month,
maybe a year.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.890
Don't worry about me. And thanks,
Dracula. You gave me a great idea.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.928
I gave you...

06:56.829 --> 06:58.764
- Now look what you've done.
- Yeah... What I've done?

06:58.832 --> 07:00.766
With your lies
about selling newspapers!

07:00.834 --> 07:03.098
I sold as many newspapers
as you supported a family at 13.

07:03.170 --> 07:06.105
- I opened a shooting gallery.
- With money you borrowed from your uncle.

07:06.173 --> 07:08.437
- We better insure him for a million.
- He's worth more.

07:08.508 --> 07:11.443
- The bonehead.
- Yes, but what a genius.

07:11.511 --> 07:13.775
<i>Get me a copy of that
O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

07:13.847 --> 07:15.781
I guess I'll have
to read it now.

07:15.849 --> 07:19.114
Make that two copies.
Why should I suffer alone?

07:27.262 --> 07:29.890
- How's this?
- Isn't that overdoing it, a bit sir?

07:29.964 --> 07:32.660
Why break their hearts?

07:32.734 --> 07:34.895
All right.
Let's try that one again.

07:34.969 --> 07:37.403
I think this one's
sufficiently seedy, sir.

07:37.472 --> 07:39.736
There's no use overplaying it,
is there, sir?

07:47.983 --> 07:49.916
Yes?

07:49.984 --> 07:52.418
- Your wife is on one, sir.
- What does she want?

07:52.487 --> 07:55.581
I suspect it has something to do
with today's being the 15th.

07:55.657 --> 07:58.319
Payday. All right, put her on.

07:58.393 --> 08:00.327
You may connect Mrs. Sullivan.

08:01.129 --> 08:03.063
Yes?

08:03.131 --> 08:06.430
You don't happen to remember
what day this is, do you, dear?

08:06.501 --> 08:08.765
Yes, I happen to remember
what day it is.

08:08.836 --> 08:12.101
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Have you?

08:12.173 --> 08:14.938
Perhaps I could be a little
more polite, Mrs. Sullivan,

08:15.010 --> 08:17.410
but somehow, when I talk to you
I don't feel polite.

08:17.479 --> 08:19.447
I regret it,
but that's the way it is.

08:19.515 --> 08:21.779
I don't know whether
I signed it or not.

08:21.850 --> 08:23.784
I always close my eyes
when I sign your check.

08:23.852 --> 08:26.377
Maybe I signed the blotter.

08:28.857 --> 08:31.382
Have you made out
the Panther Woman's check yet?

08:31.460 --> 08:34.258
You better get it down to her before
she comes up here with the sheriff.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.264
<i>She has a very peculiar
sense of humor.</i>

08:36.332 --> 08:38.392
Good morning, sir.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.434
Good morning, Burrows.
How do you like it?

08:40.501 --> 08:43.130
I don't like it at all, sir.
Fancy dress, I take it?

08:43.205 --> 08:45.139
- What's the matter with it?
- I have never been sympathetic...

08:45.207 --> 08:46.543
to the caricaturing of
the poor and needy, sir.

08:46.556 --> 08:47.903
Who's
caricaturing?

08:47.977 --> 08:49.911
Burrows doesn't know
about the expedition, sir.

08:49.979 --> 08:52.413
I'm going out on the road to find out
what it's like to be poor and needy,

08:52.481 --> 08:54.415
and then I'm going
to make a picture about it.

08:54.483 --> 08:56.576
If you'll permit me to say so, sir,
the subject is not an interesting one.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.586
The poor know all about poverty...

08:58.654 --> 09:00.815
and only the morbid rich
would find the topic glamorous.

09:00.889 --> 09:02.824
But I'm doing it for the poor.
Don't you understand?

09:02.892 --> 09:04.826
I doubt if they would
appreciate it, sir.

09:04.894 --> 09:08.091
They rather resent the invasion of their
privacy, I believe quite properly, sir.

09:08.164 --> 09:11.099
Also, such excursions can be
extremely dangerous, sir.

09:11.167 --> 09:14.261
I worked for a gentleman once
who likewise, with two friends,

09:14.337 --> 09:18.273
accoutered themselves as you have,
sir, and then went out for a lark.

09:18.341 --> 09:20.275
They have not been
heard from since.

09:20.343 --> 09:22.436
- That was some time ago?
- 1912, sir.

09:22.512 --> 09:26.004
<i>- Huh.
- You see, sir, rich people...</i>

09:26.083 --> 09:28.381
and theorists...
who are usually rich people...

09:28.452 --> 09:30.386
think of poverty in the negative,

09:30.454 --> 09:32.387
as the lack of riches...

09:32.455 --> 09:34.582
as disease might be called
the lack of health.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.626
<i>But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything,</i>

09:37.694 --> 09:40.390
but a positive plague,
virulent in itself,

09:40.463 --> 09:43.557
contagious as cholera,
with filth, criminality,

09:43.633 --> 09:47.399
vice and despair as only
a few of its symptoms.

09:47.470 --> 09:51.237
It is to be stayed away from,
even for purposes of study.

09:51.308 --> 09:53.333
It is to be shunned.

09:53.411 --> 09:55.572
You seem to have made
quite a study of it.

09:55.646 --> 09:59.241
Quite unwillingly, sir.
Will that be all, sir?

09:59.316 --> 10:02.114
- Thanks.
- Very good, sir.

10:04.822 --> 10:07.086
He gets a little bit gruesome
every once in a while.

10:07.158 --> 10:09.922
Yeah.
Always reading books, sir.

10:09.994 --> 10:12.588
- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, sir,

10:12.663 --> 10:15.599
I don't like the idea of a gentleman
of your inexperience...

10:15.667 --> 10:17.931
leaving with only ten cents
in his pockets,

10:18.003 --> 10:20.096
so I took
the extreme liberty, sir,

10:20.172 --> 10:22.766
of having a studio
identification card...

10:22.841 --> 10:25.206
sewed into the sole
of each of your boots.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.643
You'd think I was a child.
The whole purpose of this expedition...

10:28.712 --> 10:32.079
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

10:32.149 --> 10:34.777
Before you all get started,
I just want to tell you one thing...

10:34.852 --> 10:36.945
- My mind is made up.
- Nobody's here to argue, Sully.

10:37.021 --> 10:38.955
- I know.
- You know that your slightest wish...

10:39.023 --> 10:41.288
We talked it all over,
and there's something to the idea.

10:41.359 --> 10:43.293
- There's a great deal to it.
- Stupendous.

10:43.361 --> 10:45.625
Cassy has it all worked out. It's safe
as a church, big as a cathedral.

10:45.697 --> 10:47.631
Bigger!
It's the story of the year.

10:47.699 --> 10:49.724
It'll make the front page
of every newspaper in the country.

10:49.801 --> 10:51.462
- I'm sending five of my boys...
- With me in charge.

10:51.536 --> 10:53.299
An advance agent in front
and a follow-up behind.

10:53.371 --> 10:55.339
- A cook and a still man.
- I want lots of 8x10's.

10:55.407 --> 10:57.500
- Now, listen...
- I'm revamping that lovely land yacht...

10:57.576 --> 10:59.510
<i>that Demille used
in Northwest Mounted.</i>

10:59.578 --> 11:02.308
- It follows at a discreet dis...
- Hot coffee, sandwiches, and a bar in back.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.145
It's connected to the studio
by shortwave, and it also carries...

11:05.218 --> 11:07.209
- A hot shower and a secretary.
- And a physician.

11:07.286 --> 11:09.220
Look, I'm trying
to find trouble,

11:09.288 --> 11:11.222
but I won't find it with six acts
of vaudeville on my tail...

11:11.290 --> 11:13.224
at least, not the kind
I'm looking for.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.487
- Be reasonable, Sully.
- I'm reupholstering it from stem to stern.

11:15.561 --> 11:17.755
- Wait till you see.
- I tell you, I've made up my mind.

11:17.829 --> 11:19.763
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.036
In that case, there's
nothing else to do...

11:21.049 --> 11:22.265
You said it.

11:22.334 --> 11:24.234
but to serve you with this summons
to appear and show cause...

11:24.302 --> 11:25.570
why you should not be
restrained from jeopardizing

11:25.583 --> 11:26.862
your unique and
extraordinary services...

11:26.938 --> 11:28.258
by willfully, recklessly
and unnecessarily...

11:28.271 --> 11:29.601
Will you please
wait a minute!

11:29.675 --> 11:31.939
We have all day, Sully,
but you must realize...

11:32.011 --> 11:34.946
we also have minds,
also made up.

11:52.698 --> 11:55.634
Thus begins this
remarkable expedition...

11:55.702 --> 11:57.323
into the valley of the
shadow of adversity.

11:57.336 --> 11:58.967
The shadow
of the what?

11:59.039 --> 12:00.973
The valley of the
shadow of adversity.

12:01.041 --> 12:04.477
- It's what you call a paraphrase.
- Alone and unattended...

12:04.545 --> 12:06.166
With eight
stooges.

12:06.179 --> 12:07.810
I'll write the story, if
it's just the same to you.

12:07.881 --> 12:11.475
Prey to passing prowlers,
poverty and policemen,

12:11.551 --> 12:14.816
- How poetic.
- with only ten cents in his pocket,

12:14.887 --> 12:17.981
- I wish I had what he's got in the bank.
- John Lloyd Sullivan,

12:18.057 --> 12:20.151
the Caliph of Comedy...

12:20.227 --> 12:23.594
- Departed Hollywood at 4:00 this morning.
- You said it.

12:28.168 --> 12:31.103
- Can I sell you another stack, Doctor?
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda,

12:31.171 --> 12:33.105
and don't call me "Doctor. "

12:33.173 --> 12:35.607
He was talking to me, I think.
No, thank you.

12:35.676 --> 12:37.462
You say don't want some
bicarbonate of soda, Doctor?

12:37.475 --> 12:39.271
Don't call
me "Doctor"!

12:39.346 --> 12:42.747
- No, I don't want any bicarbonate of soda.
- I thought you said you did.

12:42.816 --> 12:44.751
Well, he don't!

12:46.187 --> 12:48.621
- This place is very depressing.
- So was the breakfast.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.625
Why doesn't he read a book
if he wants to learn something?

12:51.693 --> 12:54.457
- Who, the cook? He could learn plenty.
- No, Sullivan.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.622
- Maybe he don't know how to read.
- The cook?

12:56.698 --> 12:58.632
No, the...

12:58.700 --> 13:02.294
- This is gonna be a great trip.
- Sorry. I must have the wrong number.

13:02.369 --> 13:04.963
That was the lighthouse keeper
on San Clemente Island.

13:05.038 --> 13:06.972
Ask him what
his daughter's doing.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.305
I said the lighthouse keeper
on San Clemente Island.

13:11.546 --> 13:15.141
- How about a little gin rummy?
- I don't drink, thank you. Never touch it.

13:24.492 --> 13:27.427
- How about a lift, Bud?
- If you don't mind going fast.

13:27.495 --> 13:29.588
I'm studying to be
a whippet tanker.

13:29.664 --> 13:33.362
- Go to it, Lieutenant!
- You're there, General.

13:58.827 --> 14:01.796
- Can a whippet tank make a sharp turn?
- What?

14:01.864 --> 14:03.957
Can a whippet tank
go up a side road?

14:04.033 --> 14:07.264
A whippet tank can go anywhere.
Hang on!

15:50.174 --> 15:52.608
Thank you, Major.

15:52.676 --> 15:55.770
- This is where I get out.
- She's some tank, ain't she?

15:55.846 --> 15:58.110
In a class by herself.
I never felt anything like it.

15:58.182 --> 16:00.777
Well, I guess I better be
getting to school now, anyway.

16:00.852 --> 16:02.945
Yeah, I guess you better had.
Drive carefully.

16:03.021 --> 16:05.956
- You know me.
- By the way, how old are you?

16:06.024 --> 16:08.618
- Thirteen. So long.
- So long.

16:12.197 --> 16:14.165
What a future.

16:14.232 --> 16:16.166
What were you chasing,
a jackrabbit?

16:16.234 --> 16:19.499
- Felt more like a kangaroo.
- There he is!

16:19.571 --> 16:24.099
- Well, how'd you like it?
- That was a dirty trick, boss.

16:24.176 --> 16:27.613
Look, that was just a rough idea,
unless you play ball with me.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.079
You know I can't do what I started out
to do with you guys chasing me around,

16:30.148 --> 16:32.082
so I'll make you
a fair proposition.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.084
You can go on wherever you like
and take it easy for a couple of weeks,

16:34.152 --> 16:36.086
and I'll join you then
or sooner.

16:36.154 --> 16:38.088
If the boss wants to talk to me,
I'm just up ahead,

16:38.156 --> 16:40.021
mooching a lunch
from a farmer's wife.

16:40.091 --> 16:41.922
Now, is that a square proposition
or isn't it?

16:41.993 --> 16:43.449
Well, I always wanted
to go to Boulder Dam.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.928
You're there.

16:44.996 --> 16:46.930
Yeah, well, if you think
I'm going to look at Boulder Dam...

16:46.998 --> 16:49.024
How about
National Yellow Park?

16:49.101 --> 16:51.934
That goes double
for National Yellow Park.

16:52.004 --> 16:54.939
- If you'd said Las Vegas...
- What do they do in Las Vegas?

16:55.007 --> 16:57.805
Everything, Doctor.
It's an education.

16:57.877 --> 17:00.778
All right. I'll meet you in Las Vegas,
on or about the first.

17:00.847 --> 17:03.441
And thanks, kids.
Thanks sincerely.

17:14.694 --> 17:16.560
Yoo-hoo!

17:20.032 --> 17:22.500
- Yes, ma'am?
- Don't get too tired.

17:22.568 --> 17:25.833
Yes, ma'am.

17:25.905 --> 17:29.397
First day's work. You don't suppose
you're overworking him, do you?

17:29.475 --> 17:32.911
Oh, but I doubt it. He seems
very strong. Did you notice his torso?

17:32.979 --> 17:35.573
- I notice that you noticed it.
- Don't be vindictive, dear.

17:35.648 --> 17:37.605
Some people are just
naturally more sensitive

17:37.618 --> 17:39.585
to some things in life
than some people.

17:39.653 --> 17:42.417
Some are blind to beauty,
while others...

17:42.489 --> 17:46.585
Even as a little girl, you were more of
acid type, dear, while I, if you remember...

17:46.660 --> 17:48.821
- I remember better than you do.
- Well, forget it.

17:48.896 --> 17:51.797
And furthermore, I have never done
anything that I was ashamed of, Ursula.

17:51.865 --> 17:54.925
- Neither have I.
- Yes, but nobody ever asked you to.

17:55.002 --> 17:56.207
Why, Zeffie
Kornhauser!

17:56.220 --> 17:57.436
Now that you've had
your attack for the day,

17:57.504 --> 18:00.439
let's endeavor to recapture our
good humor and remember our breeding.

18:00.507 --> 18:03.443
- Baloney.
- Yes. I do hope he likes it here.

18:03.511 --> 18:06.446
It's so hard to keep a man.
Do you know what I need?

18:06.514 --> 18:08.448
- Yes!
- I need a permanent.

18:08.516 --> 18:10.450
I was thinking of taking in
a picture show,

18:10.518 --> 18:12.451
which brings up the problem
of clothes for the young man.

18:12.519 --> 18:14.453
- It certainly does.
- Do you think...

18:14.521 --> 18:16.284
<i>dear Joseph would mind
if we gave him...</i>

18:16.356 --> 18:18.290
<i>some of the clothes
he has so little need for now?</i>

18:18.358 --> 18:20.292
<i>He's never minded before.</i>

19:22.024 --> 19:23.889
- Sleep tight.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.052
- And don't let the skeeters bite.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:26.128 --> 19:28.062
- You're sure you have everything you want?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.064
- Absolutely sure?
- Positive.

19:30.132 --> 19:32.896
- But your bed isn't open.
- That's all right. I'll take care of that.

19:32.968 --> 19:35.402
Oh, nonsense.
That's woman's work.

19:35.471 --> 19:37.735
? For men must work
and women must weep?

19:37.806 --> 19:40.798
Or however it goes.
Ahh!

19:48.652 --> 19:51.587
- There. Would you like a hot water bottle?
- No, ma'am.

19:51.655 --> 19:53.816
- You haven't any pajamas.
- I never use them.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.824
- Joseph wore a nightgown.
- Is that a fact?

19:55.892 --> 19:57.825
Oh, yes.

19:59.495 --> 20:02.760
- Well, I guess there's nothing else.
- No, I guess not.

20:02.831 --> 20:04.924
I'll let you know as soon
as the bathroom is free.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.935
- It's community.
- Ah.

20:07.003 --> 20:08.937
Well, uh...

20:09.005 --> 20:11.098
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:12.676 --> 20:15.941
- Do you think he'll stay?
- I do, do hope so.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.973
Who is it?

22:29.182 --> 22:32.275
Say, could you give me a lift?
I'm freezing to death.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.785
- What did you fall into?
- Everything there was.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.618
Okay. Hop in the back.
Here. Drape this around you.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.454
Thanks a million, buddy.
- Okay.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.124
Come on, Buddy, wake up.
This is as far as I go.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.964
- Huh? What? Who are you?
- Come on, wake up.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.300
I don't want the boss to see you.
We ain't supposed to give lifts.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.135
Sure. Thanks a lot.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.474
- Hey, what city is this?
- That's Hollywood.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.750
Hollywood?

22:59.763 --> 23:00.979
You get a chance to see
the moving picture stars.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.982
Well, so long.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.030
- Good morning.
- Morning.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.275
Give me a cup of coffee and a donut,
if that's enough for it.

23:29.343 --> 23:32.107
- You want it plain or with powdered sugar?
- With a little cream.

23:32.179 --> 23:36.115
- The sinker?
- Any kind, or some rolls. I don't care.

23:36.183 --> 23:38.117
Yes, sir.

23:38.185 --> 23:40.949
Give him some ham and eggs.

23:41.021 --> 23:42.955
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

23:43.023 --> 23:45.116
That's very kind of you sister,
but I'm not hungry.

23:45.192 --> 23:47.787
A cup of coffee and a sinker
will fix me up fine.

23:47.862 --> 23:50.626
Don't be a sucker.
Give him some ham and eggs.

23:50.698 --> 23:54.964
The way I'm fixed, 35 cents
isn't going to make any difference.

23:55.036 --> 23:57.300
- Here.
- Thanks.

23:58.706 --> 24:00.640
Things a little tough, huh?

24:00.708 --> 24:03.768
I wouldn't be sitting
in an owl wagon for local color.

24:06.214 --> 24:08.478
They locked me out
of my room.

24:08.549 --> 24:11.313
That's too bad.
Well, things are tough everywhere.

24:11.386 --> 24:13.981
War in Europe, strikes over here...
There's no work.

24:14.056 --> 24:16.649
- There's no food.
- Drink your coffee while it's hot.

24:21.062 --> 24:22.734
What did they lock you
out of your room for?

24:22.747 --> 24:24.429
Did I ask you
any questions?

24:24.499 --> 24:26.433
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

24:26.501 --> 24:29.197
- You been in Hollywood long?
- Long enough.

24:29.270 --> 24:32.535
- Trying to crash the movies or something?
- Something like that.

24:32.607 --> 24:34.541
- I guess that's pretty hard to do, huh?
- I guess so.

24:34.609 --> 24:36.771
I never got close enough
to find out.

24:36.845 --> 24:38.779
- Oh. Sorry.
- Say, who's being sorry for who?

24:38.847 --> 24:41.441
Am I buying you the eggs
or are you buying me the eggs?

24:41.517 --> 24:43.303
I'd just like
to repay you.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.112
All right, give me a letter
of introduction to Lubitsch.

24:45.187 --> 24:46.990
I might be able to do that.
Who's Lubitsch?

24:47.003 --> 24:48.816
Drink your
coffee.

24:50.359 --> 24:52.293
- Can you act?
- What did you say?

24:52.361 --> 24:54.625
- I said, can you act?
- Sure, I can act.

24:54.697 --> 24:55.732
Would you like me to
give you a recitation?

24:55.745 --> 24:56.790
Go ahead.

24:56.865 --> 24:59.629
Skip it. My next act will be
an impersonation...

24:59.702 --> 25:01.967
of a young lady going home...
on the thumb.

25:02.038 --> 25:04.632
- In that outfit?
- What about your own outfit?

25:04.708 --> 25:06.972
- I mean, haven't you got a car?
- No. Have you?

25:07.043 --> 25:08.976
- No, but...
- Then don't get ritzy.

25:09.044 --> 25:11.137
And I'll tell you some
other things I haven't got.

25:11.213 --> 25:13.306
I haven't got a yacht,
or a pearl necklace,

25:13.382 --> 25:15.316
or a fur coat,
or a country seat,

25:15.384 --> 25:17.318
or even a winter seat.

25:17.386 --> 25:19.786
I could use a new girdle, too.

25:19.855 --> 25:22.585
I wish I could give you some
of the things you need.

25:22.658 --> 25:26.595
You wouldn't be trying
to lead me astray, would you?

25:26.663 --> 25:28.756
You know, the nice thing about
buying food for a man...

25:28.832 --> 25:31.096
is that you don't have
to laugh at his jokes.

25:31.167 --> 25:34.762
Just think... if you were some big shot,
like a casting director,

25:34.838 --> 25:37.204
I'd be staring into
your bridgework saying,

25:37.273 --> 25:40.174
"Yes, Mr. Smearkase.
No, Mr. Smearkase.

25:40.243 --> 25:42.507
<i>"Not really, Mr. Smearkase.</i>

25:42.579 --> 25:45.047
Oh, Mr. Smearkase,
that's my knee. "

25:46.416 --> 25:49.283
Give Mr. Smearkase another
cup of coffee. Make it two.

25:49.352 --> 25:51.287
- Want a piece of pie?
- No thanks, kid.

25:51.355 --> 25:53.949
Why, Mr. smearkase, aren't you
getting a little familiar?

25:54.025 --> 25:55.959
Look...

25:56.027 --> 25:57.961
Thanks.

25:58.029 --> 26:00.122
Look, if you wanted to stay
in Hollywood a little longer...

26:00.196 --> 26:02.357
I don't want to stay
in Hollywood a little longer.

26:02.432 --> 26:04.627
I've used up all my money,
all my going-home money.

26:04.701 --> 26:06.794
I was just gonna say,
I have a friend that's out of town...

26:06.870 --> 26:08.804
and you might be able to stay
at his place for a couple of weeks...

26:08.872 --> 26:11.807
and maybe by then things
will break a little better for you.

26:11.875 --> 26:12.830
He might even be able
to help you a little.

26:12.843 --> 26:13.809
No, thanks.

26:13.877 --> 26:15.812
There's no strings
to this, kid.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.973
I know you don't know who I am, but
I used to know a few people around here.

26:18.049 --> 26:19.983
And this guy's
really out of town.

26:20.051 --> 26:22.315
And you know a way in
through the window. No, thanks.

26:22.386 --> 26:24.752
- No. I'm pretty sure that in this case...
- I'm going home, big boy.

26:24.822 --> 26:26.813
I can get a ride out of here
in a little while.

26:26.891 --> 26:30.884
I don't like to think of you asking a
bunch of thugs for lifts along the highway.

26:30.961 --> 26:32.929
Then don't
think about it.

26:32.942 --> 26:34.920
You mean you'd just get in
any car that comes along?

26:34.999 --> 26:36.955
Anything but a Stanley Steamer.
My uncle blew up in one.

26:36.968 --> 26:38.935
That's terrible.

26:39.003 --> 26:41.700
You can't tell what kind of a heel
is apt to be behind the wheel.

26:41.773 --> 26:43.707
All heels are
pretty much the same.

26:43.775 --> 26:45.936
- Look.
- Yes, Mr. Smearkase?

26:46.011 --> 26:48.445
This friend of mine... the guy I was
telling you about that's out of town...

26:48.513 --> 26:50.947
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if I borrowed his car.

26:51.016 --> 26:54.507
- What is it, a street car?
- It's a car. Just wait here.

26:54.585 --> 26:56.519
You're just going to get
yourself in trouble.

26:56.587 --> 26:59.954
I'm not going to get myself in trouble.
I'm going to repay you.

27:00.024 --> 27:02.117
That isn't necessary,
big boy.

27:02.193 --> 27:04.128
Someday, when your ship
comes in,

27:04.196 --> 27:06.790
you can buy somebody that's hungry
some ham and eggs and be all square.

27:06.865 --> 27:10.130
That's fine. Just wait here
and I'll be back before you can say...

27:10.202 --> 27:12.136
- What was that big director's name?
- Lubitsch.

27:12.204 --> 27:14.138
Lubitsch.

27:14.206 --> 27:16.834
Say, this is some car.

27:16.908 --> 27:18.842
Yes. Now, where
would you like to go?

27:18.910 --> 27:22.710
Could you drop me off at, uh...
Or maybe that'd be too far.

27:22.781 --> 27:26.239
- That depends entirely on where it is.
- Would Chicago be too far?

27:26.318 --> 27:29.413
- Chicago? You mean Chicago, Illinois?
- Yes.

27:29.489 --> 27:32.083
I wasn't actually thinking
of driving as far as Chicago.

27:32.158 --> 27:34.092
That's all right.
You can drop me anywhere.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.094
I just happened to think
of Chicago because...

27:36.162 --> 27:38.756
that's a little better than halfway and
I can easily hitch a ride out of there.

27:38.831 --> 27:42.267
- Where do you live, Bermuda?
- You don't have to get funny.

27:42.335 --> 27:44.962
I didn't ask you for a ride.
You can drop me anywhere.

27:45.036 --> 27:47.266
Wait a minute. How's this?

27:47.339 --> 27:49.273
Suppose you drop me off somewhere
and you go leisurely home...

27:49.341 --> 27:51.275
and I'll pick up the car later.

27:51.343 --> 27:53.278
That's what you call an idea.

27:53.346 --> 27:55.280
You don't happen to operate
out of a booby hatch, do you?

27:55.348 --> 27:58.647
You better drop me at the next corner and
take this bus back where you stole it from.

27:58.718 --> 28:02.950
Don't talk nonsense. I left a note
saying I was taking the car...

28:03.022 --> 28:05.456
- Or did I?
- It would be nice if you could remember.

28:05.525 --> 28:08.255
Would be funny, though,
if they arrested me for taking it.

28:08.327 --> 28:10.261
A panic.
Who does it belong to?

28:10.329 --> 28:11.802
Belongs to a picture director...
a guy named Sullivan.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.298
Oh.

28:13.366 --> 28:15.300
- You never heard of him?
- No.

28:15.368 --> 28:17.461
He's made quite a few pictures.

28:17.537 --> 28:19.506
<i>Ants In Your Plants of 1939.</i>

28:19.573 --> 28:21.803
- Did he do that?
- Yeah. Did you see it?

28:21.875 --> 28:24.571
- Yes.
- Well? Well, did you like it?

28:24.645 --> 28:28.741
- Not much.
- Some people thought it was pretty good.

28:28.815 --> 28:30.749
I don't care for musicals.
They hurt my ears.

28:30.817 --> 28:34.913
<i>I see. Well, did you like
Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft?</i>

28:34.988 --> 28:38.252
- Oh, I was crazy about that.
- I thought that would just about fit.

28:38.324 --> 28:39.609
You remember the scene where
the two are in the hayloft?

28:39.622 --> 28:40.918
Perfectly.

28:40.993 --> 28:44.088
And she made him close his eyes
and count three before kissing her.

28:44.164 --> 28:45.199
Yes, yes.

28:45.212 --> 28:46.257
And then the pig came out and
he kissed the pig instead.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.267
It was on a very high plane.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.269
Then he fell through a hole
and sneezed at a horse.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.601
And the horse sneezed
back at him.

28:52.673 --> 28:54.664
Oh, that was
a wonderful scene.

28:54.741 --> 28:58.700
Of course it was stupid, but it was
wonderful. Who directed that picture?

29:00.180 --> 29:02.307
Don't you think with the world
in its present condition,

29:02.382 --> 29:04.612
with death snarling at you
from every street corner,

29:04.685 --> 29:07.120
that people are a little
allergic to comedies?

29:07.188 --> 29:10.055
- No.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

29:10.124 --> 29:13.184
Say, how come you know a picture
director well enough to borrow his car?

29:13.261 --> 29:16.128
As a matter of fact,
I used to know most of those boys,

29:16.197 --> 29:19.291
but naturally I don't
like to mention it in a suit like this.

29:19.367 --> 29:23.394
As a matter of fact,
I used to be a picture director.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.565
- Why, you poor kid.
- Don't get emotional. I'll be all right.

29:26.641 --> 29:28.574
What kind of pictures
did you make?

29:28.642 --> 29:31.236
- More along educational lines.
- Oh, no wonder.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.247
There's nothing like a deep-dish movie
to drive you out in the open.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.249
What are you talking about?

29:36.317 --> 29:38.581
Film's the greatest educational
medium the world has ever known.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.188
<i>You take a picture
like Hold Back Tomorrow.</i>

29:40.201 --> 29:41.747
<i>You hold it.</i>

29:41.823 --> 29:43.757
- Did you ever meet Lubitsch?
- Yes.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.759
Gee, I bet he wouldn't even
speak to you now.

29:45.827 --> 29:49.490
- He spoke to me day before yesterday.
- Isn't that swell.

29:49.564 --> 29:52.590
Funny, isn't it... to meet
your first picture director...

29:52.667 --> 29:54.999
on the day you're leaving
Hollywood, all washed up...

29:55.069 --> 29:57.004
even a washed-up director.

29:57.072 --> 29:59.438
Don't get sympathetic.
I might make a comeback, you know.

29:59.508 --> 30:01.442
That's what they all say.
Man that had my room ahead of me...

30:01.510 --> 30:03.444
he was always going
to make a comeback.

30:03.512 --> 30:07.778
He was a picture director too.
Then one day he shot himself instead.

30:07.850 --> 30:10.114
They had to re-paper the room.

30:10.185 --> 30:13.120
You wouldn't ever do anything
like that would you, big boy?

30:13.188 --> 30:15.122
Not on your wallpaper.

30:20.162 --> 30:22.096
What do you suppose that is?

30:22.164 --> 30:24.098
Whatever it is, there's
absolutely nothing they can do.

30:24.166 --> 30:25.963
Remember that.

30:26.035 --> 30:27.519
What did you say?

30:27.532 --> 30:29.027
I said there's absolutely
nothing they can do.

30:34.877 --> 30:36.412
All right, you.

30:36.425 --> 30:37.971
All right yourself.
Don't give it a thought.

30:41.650 --> 30:43.584
Well?

30:43.652 --> 30:46.144
Oh, good morning, sir.

30:46.222 --> 30:48.315
- I'm so sorry.
- Good morning, sir.

30:48.391 --> 30:50.985
- Ever seen this man before?
- That is Mr. Sullivan, sir,

30:51.061 --> 30:54.553
- the owner of the alleged hot car.
- Then what's all the hullabaloo?

30:54.631 --> 30:55.825
That's what I'd like to know.

30:55.899 --> 30:57.833
<i>- You John L. Sullivan?
- What about it?</i>

30:57.901 --> 30:59.835
- What's your occupation?
- Motion picture director.

30:59.903 --> 31:01.837
- That right?
- Yes, sir.

31:01.905 --> 31:03.839
Let me see
your driver's license.

31:03.907 --> 31:05.841
- I haven't got it. Did you bring it?
- No, sir.

31:05.909 --> 31:07.843
- Driving without a license, huh?
- Yes, isn't that terrible?

31:07.911 --> 31:10.506
I suppose that calls for a dollar fine
and ten minutes in jail.

31:10.581 --> 31:12.844
- You sure this is Sullivan?
- Oh, quite, sir.

31:12.916 --> 31:17.182
- What are you doing in those clothes?
- I just paid my income tax.

31:17.253 --> 31:19.687
- All right, but you don't drive
that car without a license. - Okay.

31:19.756 --> 31:22.623
Let the girl out too.
She's getting bored in there.

31:22.692 --> 31:24.626
How does a girl fit
in this picture?

31:24.694 --> 31:26.628
There's always a girl
in the picture.

31:26.696 --> 31:28.630
Haven't you ever been
to the movies?

31:28.698 --> 31:31.792
Where's he taking us now?
Whose car is this?

31:31.868 --> 31:34.132
- The same guy. Sullivan.
- Where's he taking us?

31:34.204 --> 31:38.141
Down to the depot to buy you a ticket
and send you home. Stop fooling around.

31:38.209 --> 31:40.643
- Who's buying me a ticket?
- Sullivan.

31:40.711 --> 31:44.147
- What did I ever do for him?
- You bought him some eggs.

31:48.552 --> 31:51.316
Oh. So you're
the washed-up director.

31:51.389 --> 31:53.323
I'm afraid I exaggerated
that part of it a little bit.

31:53.391 --> 31:55.325
What are you doing
in those clothes?

31:55.393 --> 31:56.348
I just pulled that one
down at the police station.

31:56.361 --> 31:57.327
Huh?

31:57.395 --> 32:00.024
I made up a joke.
Look, I'm not sore at you.

32:00.098 --> 32:02.828
I'm sore at those cops
for dragging me all the way back here.

32:02.901 --> 32:06.495
No matter where I start out for, I always
end up right back here in Hollywood.

32:06.570 --> 32:09.664
You're a very nice girl, as a matter
of fact, and I'm glad to have met you.

32:09.740 --> 32:13.005
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly.

32:13.077 --> 32:15.011
- You mean that?
- Sincerely.

32:15.079 --> 32:17.513
Then buy me some ham and eggs
before I bite you.

32:20.418 --> 32:22.352
Home.

32:33.198 --> 32:35.132
Where's the swimming pool?

32:35.200 --> 32:37.464
You must have a swimming pool.

32:37.536 --> 32:39.561
Right out here.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.142
Outside dining room,

32:45.210 --> 32:47.144
- barbecue...
- Hmm.

32:52.452 --> 32:54.386
Pretty, isn't it?

32:54.454 --> 32:56.387
Yeah.

32:56.455 --> 32:58.480
There's the tennis court
up there,

32:58.557 --> 33:01.151
grape arbor there,
and a grove there.

33:01.226 --> 33:03.490
I guess that's about all.

33:03.562 --> 33:06.827
- What are you looking
at me that way for?

33:10.368 --> 33:12.734
- Hey, you big fathead!
- What's the big idea?

33:12.804 --> 33:14.796
That's for your swimming pools
and your tennis courts...

33:14.874 --> 33:16.432
<i>and your limousines
and your barbecues.</i>

33:16.509 --> 33:18.807
That's for making fun of a poor girl
who only tried to help you,

33:18.878 --> 33:21.073
- you big faker!
- Who made fun of you?

33:21.147 --> 33:24.139
You did, with your stories of being
a washed-up director, you big clunk.

33:24.217 --> 33:26.879
Oh, I did, did I?

33:33.793 --> 33:36.284
Breakfast is served, sir.

33:38.365 --> 33:41.357
- You might have shaved.
- I need these whiskers for my experiment.

33:41.435 --> 33:44.302
- Yes, the noble experiment.
- You don't have to make any cracks.

33:44.371 --> 33:46.464
I don't suffer and starve
because I like it, you know.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.473
Neither does anybody else.

33:48.541 --> 33:50.634
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

33:50.710 --> 33:53.474
- I'm sorry I pushed you in the water too.
- I probably needed it.

33:53.546 --> 33:55.946
- You certainly did.
- Did I?

33:56.015 --> 33:59.951
I didn't mind you. As a matter of fact,
I had kind of a yen for you.

34:00.019 --> 34:01.953
- You have?
- Not in that thing.

34:02.021 --> 34:03.956
I liked you better as a tramp.

34:04.024 --> 34:06.322
<i>I can't help
what kind of people you like.</i>

34:06.393 --> 34:09.328
It's funny. I suppose
I ought to be very happy for you,

34:09.396 --> 34:11.330
as if you'd just
struck oil or something.

34:11.398 --> 34:13.422
Instead of that, I'm sore.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.297
Don't frown.
You're making lines on your face.

34:16.370 --> 34:18.338
You've taken all
the joy out of life.

34:18.405 --> 34:20.339
I was all through
with this kind of stuff.

34:20.407 --> 34:23.774
I knew I'd never have it,
but there was no envy in my heart.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.277
I'd found a friend who swiped
a car to take me home.

34:26.346 --> 34:28.281
Now I'm right back
where I started...

34:28.349 --> 34:31.944
just an extra girl having
breakfast with a director,

34:32.020 --> 34:34.284
only I didn't used to have
breakfast with them.

34:34.355 --> 34:36.789
- Maybe that was my trouble.
- Did they ever ask you to?

34:36.858 --> 34:39.621
<i>- No.
- Then don't pat yourself on the back.</i>

34:39.694 --> 34:41.786
- Take me with you.
- What?

34:41.862 --> 34:44.728
<i>On your experiment.
I don't want to be sent home.</i>

34:44.797 --> 34:47.062
Don't be childish.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

34:47.134 --> 34:49.068
You can stay here for a couple of weeks
like I told you in the owl wagon,

34:49.136 --> 34:51.070
and when I get back,
I'll see what I can do for you.

34:51.138 --> 34:53.130
I don't want to start
all that stuff again.

34:53.206 --> 34:55.141
Take me with you.

34:55.208 --> 34:57.143
When you get as far as you're going,
we can say good-bye...

34:57.211 --> 34:59.145
and I'll go the rest
of the way alone.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.943
It'll make a nice ending, and we'll
finish what we started this morning.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.041
It's absolutely
out of the question.

35:04.118 --> 35:06.643
Please. You don't know
anything about anything.

35:06.721 --> 35:08.814
You don't know how to get a meal,
how to keep a secret,

35:08.890 --> 35:11.154
- and you can't even stay out of town.
- Thanks.

35:11.225 --> 35:13.989
I know 50 times as much
about trouble as you ever will.

35:14.062 --> 35:15.997
Besides, you owe it to me.

35:16.065 --> 35:19.501
You sort of belong to me.
When you were a hobo, I found you.

35:19.568 --> 35:21.502
- Piffle.
- Please.

35:21.570 --> 35:24.368
- It's absolutely out of the question.
- I'll throw you in the water.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.907
<i>You'd take my mind off my work.</i>

35:25.975 --> 35:28.876
The big director that has
all the girls panting for him.

35:28.944 --> 35:30.878
- I tell you...
- I'll follow you.

35:30.946 --> 35:32.879
I'll tell everybody who you are,
like a kid sister.

35:32.947 --> 35:34.437
<i>You'll follow me?</i>

35:34.515 --> 35:37.780
Yes, I'll follow you,
and I'll holler, " This guy's a phony.

35:37.852 --> 35:39.945
"This is Sullivan,
the big director from Hollywood...

35:40.021 --> 35:41.956
a phonus-balonus, a faker, a heel... "

35:42.024 --> 35:43.958
If I may join in
the controversy, sir,

35:44.026 --> 35:45.960
I think the young lady's
suggestion an excellent one.

35:46.028 --> 35:47.962
<i>- You may not join in the controversy.
- I will, I will, I will!</i>

35:48.030 --> 35:49.964
- I'm going with you!
- You'll do nothing of the kind.

35:50.032 --> 35:52.466
Would you get me some
tramp clothes, Mr. Burrows?

35:52.534 --> 35:53.973
Certainly, Miss.
Certainly.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.435
Go down to the station
and get me a ticket to...

35:55.504 --> 35:58.268
- Where do you live?
- I won't tell you. I won't be sent home.

35:58.340 --> 36:01.138
You stop that! Now, stop that!
Grab her feet!

36:01.210 --> 36:03.144
Oh! Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.

36:03.212 --> 36:04.964
Now, miss... Now, miss...
Stop it, please, miss!

36:04.977 --> 36:06.740
I won't be
sent home!

36:06.816 --> 36:09.080
- Let go of me!
- Oh, my!

36:15.992 --> 36:18.552
Mr. Burrows...
This way, Mr. Burrows.

36:18.628 --> 36:22.530
<i>There we are.
Now, one, two, three... Pull hard!</i>

36:28.170 --> 36:31.106
Hello, Information?
Have you any freight trains...

36:31.174 --> 36:34.268
going east this afternoon
or early this evening?

36:34.344 --> 36:36.778
5:48?
Thank you very much, sir.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.781
Oh, and could you tell me,
does that train carry tramps,

36:39.849 --> 36:41.942
and if so,
where do they get on?

36:42.018 --> 36:45.784
What? It's on page two.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.415
- What did you say?
- Tramps.

36:48.491 --> 36:52.450
How would you like
to take a flying... Wise guy.

36:52.529 --> 36:54.464
Yes, sir?

36:54.532 --> 36:57.023
What was that again?

36:57.101 --> 36:59.968
I said I wonder if you'd be
kind enough to settle a bet for us.

37:00.037 --> 37:01.971
Just a few of us
here at the club.

37:02.039 --> 37:04.473
If a tramp were to board
your 5:48 this afternoon,

37:04.542 --> 37:06.476
from where would he board it?

37:06.544 --> 37:10.480
I see. I see. Yes...
but not within the yard limits.

37:10.548 --> 37:12.482
I think that gives me
the complete picture.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.484
Thank you very much
for your trouble.

37:14.552 --> 37:16.485
Oh, and by the way, I win.

37:16.553 --> 37:18.487
Good day.

37:18.555 --> 37:20.990
A different approach
to the same problem.

37:38.209 --> 37:40.404
I think this is it, sir.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.442
Why don't you go
back with the car.

37:47.519 --> 37:49.612
You look about as much
like a boy as Mae West.

37:49.688 --> 37:51.781
All right, they'll
think I'm your frail.

37:51.857 --> 37:54.417
I believe it's called
a "beazel," miss, if memory serves.

37:54.493 --> 37:56.791
- Good-bye, Burrows. See you in
a couple of weeks. - Good-bye.

37:56.862 --> 37:59.797
May I close, sir, by warning you
against the entire expedition,

37:59.865 --> 38:01.958
which I envision
with deep apprehension...

38:02.033 --> 38:05.366
- and gloomy foreboding.
- Thanks. Same to you.

38:05.437 --> 38:07.371
Come on.

39:19.846 --> 39:22.407
Jump!

39:30.858 --> 39:33.326
<i>Come on. Here.</i>

39:33.393 --> 39:35.327
I'll help you.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.634
- Let me up!
- I've got you!

39:53.513 --> 39:56.880
- We made it!
- Yeah.

39:57.951 --> 39:59.976
Amateurs.

40:08.695 --> 40:10.629
Phew!

40:13.101 --> 40:15.365
Oh. How do you do?

40:17.305 --> 40:20.968
- Beautiful weather.
- If it doesn't rain.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.405
How do you feel about
the labor situation?

40:31.719 --> 40:33.653
Where are you going?

40:39.895 --> 40:41.988
I hope we didn't disturb you.

40:47.068 --> 40:50.162
- Very interesting couple.
- Yeah.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.174
- Do you smell anything?
- I certainly do.

40:54.242 --> 40:56.506
- What does it smell like to you?
- Hogs.

40:56.577 --> 40:59.546
- That's what I was afraid of.
- I'm getting hungry.

40:59.614 --> 41:02.675
How can you possibly
be hungry when you just ate?

41:02.751 --> 41:05.686
I'm not a scientist.
All I know is I'm hungry.

41:07.756 --> 41:10.020
You'd better tell the porter
to close the window.

41:10.092 --> 41:13.220
I didn't ask you to come along
in the first place. Now that you're...

41:15.264 --> 41:17.198
<i>Don't start baking wise cracks.</i>

41:17.266 --> 41:20.429
<i>- Dough, sir.
- Blasted draft in here, at that.</i>

41:20.502 --> 41:22.436
- Where is this train going?
- I don't know.

41:22.504 --> 41:25.133
- How long does it take to get there?
- I didn't ask you to come along.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.472
I think that's a perfectly
reasonable question.

41:27.544 --> 41:29.808
Haven't you got enough imagination
to pretend we're broke,

41:29.879 --> 41:32.404
hungry, homeless,
drifting in despair?

41:32.482 --> 41:35.610
Let's just sit here and try
to feel like a couple of tramps.

42:05.582 --> 42:07.846
- Cold?
- I'll be all right.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.852
- It's the desert.
- I'll be all right.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.013
As soon as this blasted thing
comes to a town someplace,

42:13.089 --> 42:15.024
I'll send for a car
and have you taken home.

42:15.092 --> 42:17.026
This is a lot
of "hokey-palokey. "

42:17.094 --> 42:19.494
This is a terrible way
to travel, with a girl.

42:19.563 --> 42:21.497
It's better with a girl than without
one. You would have frozen to death.

42:21.565 --> 42:25.194
If I go back,
will you go back with me?

42:25.269 --> 42:27.203
<i>- Dodsense.
- Then I won't go back, either.</i>

42:27.271 --> 42:29.107
You're so simple, you're
apt to get into trouble.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.967
Why do you
think I'm here?

42:32.042 --> 42:33.976
Gee, I like that about you.

42:34.044 --> 42:35.978
You're like those knights
of old,

42:36.046 --> 42:38.241
who used to ride around
looking for trouble.

42:38.314 --> 42:41.773
<i>- Who was it who rode on a pure white horse?
- Lady Godiva.</i>

42:41.852 --> 42:46.050
She must have been a nut. I bet
her husband was sore. Are you jealous?

42:46.123 --> 42:49.490
Why don't you shut up
and try to get some sleep.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.495
- Will you go to sleep too?
- I'll try.

42:52.563 --> 42:55.828
Why don't you try counting the hogs
jumping over a hedge?

42:55.900 --> 42:59.734
Listen, short britches...

43:29.701 --> 43:31.794
- What's that?
- Nothing. Just me.

43:31.870 --> 43:34.304
- What?
- I sneezed.

43:34.372 --> 43:37.466
- You what?
- I...

43:37.542 --> 43:39.976
- I sneezed.
- Oh, you poor darling.

43:40.045 --> 43:42.570
- Have you got hay fever?
- I think it's hog fever.

43:44.649 --> 43:46.640
Oh, you poor lamb.

43:46.718 --> 43:49.983
It'll be alright
as soon as the sun gets a little warmer.

43:50.055 --> 43:53.150
<i>Are you hungry?
You got me doing it.</i>

43:53.226 --> 43:55.990
- Have we got any eating money?
- Ten cents.

43:56.062 --> 43:58.496
Can we spend it for breakfast,
or are you saving it for something?

43:58.564 --> 44:00.828
Look, I've already told you,
I'll send for a car for you and...

44:00.900 --> 44:02.834
I can't help it
if I'm good-natured.

44:02.902 --> 44:05.496
I like to be with you,
and it puts me in a good humor.

44:05.571 --> 44:08.335
You take lots of girls and made them
sleep in a hog sty all night,

44:08.407 --> 44:10.341
and then didn't tell them
where their breakfast was coming from...

44:10.409 --> 44:12.672
the next morning,
they wouldn't take it lying down.

44:12.744 --> 44:14.837
We'll find some
breakfast somewhere.

44:14.913 --> 44:18.509
<i>- In some swill pail, I suppose.
- What do the other bubs do?</i>

44:18.584 --> 44:20.711
<i>They steal chickigs... chickens.</i>

44:20.786 --> 44:22.777
and they roast them
over campfires...

44:22.855 --> 44:25.790
with baked potatoes
and green corn on the cob...

44:25.858 --> 44:28.452
- with melted butter...
- Shut up!

44:28.528 --> 44:30.462
- Where do they get the butter?
- They steal it.

44:30.530 --> 44:33.124
Well, they don't.
It isn't as easy as all that.

44:33.199 --> 44:35.133
There's a lot of suffering
in this world...

44:35.201 --> 44:37.965
- that ordinary people
don't know anything about.

44:38.037 --> 44:40.471
<i>- Now what's the matter?
- I'm hungry.</i>

44:40.540 --> 44:43.806
Well...

44:54.588 --> 44:56.522
Hey, there's a town up ahead.

44:56.590 --> 44:59.320
Let's get off
and see what happens.

44:59.393 --> 45:02.988
- What town is it?
- I don't know. I suppose it's Hollywood.

45:03.063 --> 45:05.326
Look, there's a lunch stand.

45:05.398 --> 45:07.333
Come on.

45:21.248 --> 45:24.046
Come on. I can't keep
running along here all day.

45:25.852 --> 45:29.288
Here I come. Just a minute.

45:29.356 --> 45:31.484
Well, come on.

45:44.539 --> 45:48.475
- Did I hurt you any?
- Well, you didn't do me any good.

45:51.879 --> 45:54.313
Come on.

46:26.682 --> 46:29.116
A cup of coffee
and sinker for one.

46:29.184 --> 46:31.448
I never eat till noon.
It gives me indigestion.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.114
- Just make that two coffees.
- That'll be ten cents.

46:34.189 --> 46:36.123
That's all right.

46:38.694 --> 46:40.628
It's right here someplace.

46:43.365 --> 46:46.392
<i>- Holy Boses.
- What's the matter?</i>

46:46.469 --> 46:49.460
<i>I must have spent it
at that owl wagon.</i>

47:03.052 --> 47:05.486
- I'll never get rich.
- Oh, gee.

47:05.554 --> 47:07.818
You're a little richer
than you were.

47:07.890 --> 47:09.825
Hundreds of miles from everything,
cut off from the world,

47:09.893 --> 47:11.827
a taste of human kindness.

47:11.895 --> 47:14.489
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
What town is this?

47:14.564 --> 47:18.330
<i>- Las Vegas, Nevada.
- Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the busy...</i>

47:18.401 --> 47:22.770
- Las Vegas! You mean Las Vegas?
- What about it?

47:22.839 --> 47:24.773
Is there a land yacht
waiting here?

47:24.841 --> 47:27.105
Land yacht?
You mean that thing?

47:35.519 --> 47:37.453
That's perfectly wonderful,
Mr. Sullivan.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.455
I rejoice in your experience.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.786
- And where does this gentleman live?
- Just up there by the tracks.

47:41.858 --> 47:44.520
<i>- Give him $100. Never mind who from.
- That's swell.</i>

47:44.594 --> 47:46.528
- A great human-interest story.
- It'll probably ruin him.

47:46.596 --> 47:48.928
He'll give turkey dinners
to every slug that comes in...

47:48.998 --> 47:50.932
and never
hit the jackpot again.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.934
All right, all right.
Buy the kid here a few clothes,

47:53.002 --> 47:55.027
<i>and meet me in Kansas City,
someplace near the station.</i>

47:55.105 --> 47:57.198
I'm going the hard way.
So long, gang.

47:57.273 --> 48:00.971
Just a minute, please.
Sit down!

48:01.045 --> 48:03.639
- But listen, Doc!
- You listen.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.808
It's three days in bed, minimum.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.852
This is just a cold shot.
You won't even feel it.

48:08.865 --> 48:10.843
Yow!

48:10.921 --> 48:13.822
- I haven't time to spend three days in bed.
- You'll take the time.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.825
You'll get to Kansas City
just as soon, and you can imagine...

48:15.893 --> 48:19.329
that you went there on your
cow snatcher, or whatever you used.

48:19.397 --> 48:21.490
What have you got
an imagination for?

48:24.836 --> 48:26.770
- Here's something for you.
- What's that?

48:26.838 --> 48:28.772
It's Christmas. So long.

48:45.189 --> 48:47.123
Come in!

48:47.191 --> 48:49.285
Here's a wrapper for you
and some slippers.

48:49.361 --> 48:51.488
- What?
- A wrapper.

48:51.563 --> 48:54.191
Oh, thanks.

48:54.266 --> 48:56.200
There's some makeup
in the medicine cabinet.

48:56.268 --> 48:58.793
- Thanks. I can use it.
- You sure can.

49:01.273 --> 49:05.141
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand, he's
in the next room taking a little snooze.

49:05.210 --> 49:08.373
He looks great. This whole thing
is doing him a power of good.

49:33.505 --> 49:36.099
- Come in.
- Hello. Feel better?

49:36.174 --> 49:39.269
No, I'm sore. There's nothing
the matter with me but a little fever.

49:39.345 --> 49:42.280
Even if I did get sick, they could've
sent me to some free hospital.

49:42.348 --> 49:44.782
Wherever they send you.
It would have been very interesting.

49:44.851 --> 49:47.115
They give you a nice free burial too,
at Potter's Field.

49:47.186 --> 49:51.122
"Free burial. " Why does everybody
exaggerate everything so much?

49:51.190 --> 49:53.124
I've got a little cold in my head.

49:53.192 --> 49:55.126
You take a dose of salts,
and there you are.

49:55.194 --> 49:57.128
- It's because you're a very valuable man.
- Bushwah.

49:57.196 --> 49:59.460
- You make very lovely pictures.
- Phooey.

49:59.532 --> 50:01.626
- Well, you do.
- It's a funny thing, how everything...

50:01.702 --> 50:05.138
keeps shoving me back to Hollywood
or Beverly Hills...

50:07.207 --> 50:11.473
Or this monstrosity we're riding in...
almost like gravity.

50:11.545 --> 50:14.639
As if some force were saying,
"Get back where you belong.

50:14.715 --> 50:17.979
You don't belong out here
in real life, you phony, you. "

50:18.050 --> 50:19.984
You're a little feverish.

50:20.052 --> 50:22.486
<i>Maybe there's a universal law
that says, " Stay put.</i>

50:22.555 --> 50:24.819
As you are,
so shall you remain. "

50:24.891 --> 50:27.326
Maybe that's why tramps
are always in trouble.

50:27.394 --> 50:29.487
They don't vote.
They don't pay taxes.

50:29.563 --> 50:31.497
They violate the law of nature.

50:31.565 --> 50:33.499
You look very pretty
in that outfit.

50:33.567 --> 50:35.831
Maybe that's why they don't
want trailer colonies.

50:35.903 --> 50:39.498
- Or am I getting a bit profound?
- You're getting a bit hot.

50:39.573 --> 50:41.507
Your hand is very cool.

50:41.575 --> 50:43.509
But nothing is going stop me...

50:43.577 --> 50:46.512
I'm going to find out
how it feels to be in trouble,

50:46.580 --> 50:49.014
without friends, without credit,

50:49.082 --> 50:52.519
without checkbook,
without name... alone.

50:52.587 --> 50:55.852
- And I'll go with you.
- How can I be alone if you're with me?

57:39.100 --> 57:41.364
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand.
It's all finished.

57:41.436 --> 57:43.700
the greatest expedition
of modern times,

57:43.771 --> 57:46.899
almost the greatest sacrifice
ever made by human man.

57:46.974 --> 57:49.307
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Yes, ma'am.

57:49.378 --> 57:52.074
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

57:52.147 --> 57:56.015
<i>He's all washed up, except tonight
he's going through for a quick tour.</i>

57:56.085 --> 57:58.212
He's taking $1,000
in $5.00 bills...

57:58.287 --> 58:00.573
and he's going to hand
them out to these tramps

58:00.586 --> 58:02.883
in gratitude for what
they done for him.

58:02.958 --> 58:05.892
Now is that a story? Does that
give you a lump in your throat,

58:05.960 --> 58:08.190
or does that give you
a lump in your throat?

58:28.150 --> 58:30.414
- Hello.
- Hello. Tired?

58:30.486 --> 58:34.252
No, no.
I was just thinking.

58:34.323 --> 58:37.918
Well, here we are
at the end of the adventure.

58:37.993 --> 58:41.862
I'll go down tonight and give them
a little money, and that winds it up.

58:41.931 --> 58:43.865
Now, what do you want to do?

58:43.933 --> 58:46.197
Do you want to go home
or take another crack at Hollywood?

58:46.269 --> 58:48.203
- Well, I...
- with a nice, fat letter to Lubitsch?

58:48.271 --> 58:51.866
I'd sort of like to...
go where you go.

58:51.941 --> 58:54.205
I mean, I'd sort of
hoped that you'd...

58:54.277 --> 58:57.541
Well, I mean, that you'd want us
to go on together a little longer,

58:57.613 --> 58:59.706
now that we kind of
got used to each other.

58:59.782 --> 59:03.048
- Of course I would, if I wasn't married.
- Who's married?

59:03.119 --> 59:06.054
Didn't you know that? I thought
everyone had heard of my misfortune.

59:06.122 --> 59:08.215
- Of course I didn't.
- What do you mean?

59:08.291 --> 59:10.885
As if I'd snatched you
away from your loving grandmother.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.894
- Are you in love with her?
- That vulture?

59:12.962 --> 59:14.896
- Then why did you marry her?
- Income tax.

59:14.964 --> 59:18.400
- Income tax?
- It was supposed to save me $24,000 a year.

59:18.468 --> 59:21.062
It's what's called a joint return.
It's California law.

59:21.137 --> 59:24.072
Each one pays half, and the total
is less than the aggregate surtax,

59:24.140 --> 59:26.074
so the surtax is less
than the something or other.

59:26.142 --> 59:28.236
It was an idea
of my business manager's.

59:28.312 --> 59:30.906
- I think it's disgusting.
- It wasn't supposed to be romantic.

59:30.981 --> 59:34.246
It was supposed to save me
$12,000 a year, but it didn't.

59:34.318 --> 59:35.603
Turned out she couldn't
live on $12,000 a year.

59:35.616 --> 59:36.912
Good.

59:36.987 --> 59:40.150
- Lovely. She had to have $24,000.
- Good.

59:40.224 --> 59:42.988
Don't keep saying "good" all the time,
or I'll poke you in the nose.

59:43.060 --> 59:44.994
- Good.
- Now, listen.

59:45.062 --> 59:46.996
So I demanded the divorce
she'd promised me.

59:47.064 --> 59:49.031
And she told you
to go fry an egg.

59:49.098 --> 59:51.032
She said it would break
her mother's heart.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.331
Some fine advice
your business manager gave you.

59:53.404 --> 59:55.338
I found out why.
He was getting half.

59:56.707 --> 59:59.642
- And you really can't get a divorce ever?
- Never.

59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.270
You can't get a divorce without
collusion, and she won't collude.

01:00:02.346 --> 01:00:06.715
I guess
I ought to go home, then.

01:00:06.784 --> 01:00:09.878
You could still have
that letter to Lubitsch.

01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:13.720
Could I still come and push you
in the pool sometimes?

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:17.558
- Of course you could.
- I guess that's better than nothing.

01:00:17.629 --> 01:00:19.859
There, there, there.
My gracious.

01:00:19.931 --> 01:00:22.559
Here are the $5.00 bills,
Mr. Sullivan.

01:00:22.634 --> 01:00:24.568
Hello, Johnnie.

01:00:24.636 --> 01:00:26.570
Get me two tickets
on the midnight plane.

01:00:26.638 --> 01:00:30.904
Two tickets? Oh, two tickets!
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.

01:00:30.976 --> 01:00:33.740
- They're pretty, aren't they?
- Uh-huh.

01:00:33.812 --> 01:00:35.905
- Do you want one?
- Yes.

01:00:35.981 --> 01:00:38.415
Here. You can have two of them.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:02.274
Did you cancel the plane tickets?

01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:07.187
<i>They cancel themselves. I'm gonna give
him just 15 minutes more, and then...</i>

01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:09.191
I'm sure he's all right.

01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:11.853
He probably got interested
in a revival meeting or something and...

01:05:14.532 --> 01:05:16.466
Hello? Yes, Doc.

01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:21.704
Not in the hospitals, huh?

01:05:21.772 --> 01:05:24.366
Sure. I guess
that's all you can do.

01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:27.308
<i>Anyway, he didn't have an accident.</i>

01:05:27.378 --> 01:05:29.539
Oh?

01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:32.377
He isn't, huh?

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:35.009
Val has covered
the police stations.

01:05:35.085 --> 01:05:38.487
<i>- Okay.
- I guess you can come back now.</i>

01:05:38.557 --> 01:05:40.821
I should have gone with him.
I knew he'd get into trouble without me.

01:05:40.892 --> 01:05:43.156
- I told him that...
- I'll gonna give him just 12 minutes more,

01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:45.822
Then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap
and let him figure it out.

01:05:45.897 --> 01:05:48.491
- Sully'll be awfully sore if you...
- Let him be sore.

01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:51.001
I got a job too, you know.
If LeBrand ever found out...

01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:52.854
He came back
the last time.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.663
He didn't have reservations
on a plane or people waiting.

01:05:54.738 --> 01:05:56.672
- You don't know him like I know him.
- Is that so?

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.674
I guess I know him better than...

01:05:58.742 --> 01:06:01.678
- Yeah?
- Say, I'm down here to the morgue.

01:06:01.746 --> 01:06:04.510
They got a guy in a basket.
You can't tell who he is.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.017
Did the boss
have any identification?

01:06:07.085 --> 01:06:09.349
Did he have any identification
that you know of?

01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:12.356
Well, he had...
I think he said he had... Who is that?

01:06:12.424 --> 01:06:14.517
- Have they found him?
- Take it easy. We gotta check everywhere.

01:06:14.593 --> 01:06:18.359
- What identification did he have?
- In the soles of his shoes...

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.695
I think there was a card
between the soles of his shoes.

01:06:21.766 --> 01:06:23.757
Look in the soles of his shoes,
between the leather.

01:06:33.112 --> 01:06:35.273
He's coming now.
I can hear his footsteps.

01:06:43.055 --> 01:06:46.888
There's a card here. It's kind of hard
to read. It's all splattered.

01:06:59.138 --> 01:07:02.596
- He's dead? What do you mean, he's dead?
- What do you think it means?

01:07:02.675 --> 01:07:05.075
What do you send him on jobs like this
for? I've got a good mind to sue you.

01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:06.412
Do you think I like it
any better than you do?

01:07:06.425 --> 01:07:07.704
I will sue you!

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.147
I'll teach you to... Operator?
Operator, I was talking with Kansas City.

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:13.276
She's gonna sue me.

01:07:15.923 --> 01:07:19.017
I suppose I ought to fire
the whole bunch of you.

01:07:19.092 --> 01:07:22.357
Somehow I don't feel like
firing anybody.

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:24.363
Well, there's no use
your hanging around here!

01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:26.365
Get your things together
and leave this afternoon!

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:28.526
- I'll fly back.
- Yes, sir! Uh...

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:59.057
I'd like you to come
with us, my dear.

01:07:59.132 --> 01:08:01.566
Jones has explained to me.

01:08:01.635 --> 01:08:04.230
You were his last discovery...

01:08:04.305 --> 01:08:06.239
his last gift to the world.

01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:10.243
We'll take care of you always.

01:08:11.646 --> 01:08:13.580
She didn't hear you.

01:09:58.788 --> 01:10:00.881
- What's the idea, riding into the yard?
- Huh?

01:10:00.957 --> 01:10:02.891
I said, what's the idea,
riding into the freight yard?

01:10:02.959 --> 01:10:04.580
Lay off,
will you?

01:10:04.593 --> 01:10:06.224
I've got a good mind to
run you in for trespassing.

01:10:06.296 --> 01:10:09.164
Shut up, you dumb cluck.
Can't you see I'm sick?

01:10:09.233 --> 01:10:11.895
Come on, get out of here,
you dirty rat!

01:10:11.969 --> 01:10:15.426
- Go on, go on!
- Don't do that again.

01:10:15.505 --> 01:10:18.599
- That's telling him, 'bo.
- Don't do what again?

01:10:18.675 --> 01:10:21.667
<i>Come on. Come on, get going!</i>

01:10:35.993 --> 01:10:37.927
<i>Trespass. Resisting arrest.</i>

01:10:37.995 --> 01:10:39.616
<i>Atrocious assault and
battery with intent to kill.</i>

01:10:39.629 --> 01:10:41.260
<i>Huh? What?</i>

01:10:41.332 --> 01:10:43.357
- What did he say?
- We object, Your Honor.

01:10:43.434 --> 01:10:44.719
My client had been injured
and denies all knowledge.

01:10:44.732 --> 01:10:46.028
Objection
overruled.

01:10:46.103 --> 01:10:48.037
<i>- Trespass and resisting arrest.
- Object, your honor.</i>

01:10:48.105 --> 01:10:50.369
<i>The man was a railroad employee,
not an officer of the law.</i>

01:10:50.441 --> 01:10:53.205
<i>- Sustained.
- Trespass and atrocious assault.</i>

01:10:53.277 --> 01:10:55.211
<i>- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection overruled.</i>

01:10:55.279 --> 01:10:57.373
<i>Get down to business.
Prisoner at the bar.</i>

01:10:57.449 --> 01:10:59.383
<i>Prisoner at the bar!</i>

01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:01.715
- Answer when you're spoken to.
- Huh?

01:11:01.786 --> 01:11:05.186
<i>- Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Huh?</i>

01:11:05.256 --> 01:11:07.554
Guilty or not guilty to trespass
and atrocious assault...

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:10.719
with a rock upon the person
of the employee of the railroad.

01:11:12.129 --> 01:11:16.225
I guess I hit him, all right,
the way my hand feels.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.394
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:22.304
I'll pay any damages you like.
Sorry.

01:11:22.374 --> 01:11:24.365
So you still refuse
to give your name?

01:11:24.442 --> 01:11:26.740
It'll come back to me
in a minute.

01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:31.180
I have such an awful headache.
I'm all mixed up.

01:11:31.249 --> 01:11:33.410
We plead guilty, Your Honor,
with extenuating circumstances...

01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:36.716
due to temporary insanity, and throw
ourselves on the mercy of the court.

01:11:36.788 --> 01:11:39.188
Huh? What?
What did he say?

01:11:39.257 --> 01:11:42.249
Stand up. Stand up!

01:11:42.327 --> 01:11:44.261
Stand up.

01:11:49.569 --> 01:11:51.503
<i>Prisoner at the bar,</i>

01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:54.335
these are parlous times,
and we have no desire to be severe.

01:11:54.407 --> 01:11:56.431
<i>- Just a minute. I...
- Silence!</i>

01:11:56.508 --> 01:11:59.636
When confronted with violence and
hoodlumism, the court has no alternative.

01:11:59.711 --> 01:12:01.872
<i>Since you still refuse
to remember your name...</i>

01:12:01.947 --> 01:12:04.074
<i>but have pleaded guilty
to trespass and atrocious assault,</i>

01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:06.879
I will be as lenient
as my conscience permits...

01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:11.583
and not impose upon you the maximum
penalty your crimes ordinarily permit.

01:12:11.657 --> 01:12:15.218
Richard Roe, I sentence you
to six years at hard labor...

01:12:15.294 --> 01:12:17.888
<i>as prescribed by the laws
of our sovereign state.</i>

01:12:17.964 --> 01:12:20.899
<i>Six years? What's he talking about?</i>

01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:24.562
- You got off easy.
- Wait a minute. I gotta get to a phone.

01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:26.571
- I have to send a...
- Come on.

01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:29.574
- Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up!
- Come on, come on!

01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:42.349
Mister, new man.

01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:47.359
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi, Jake.

01:12:47.427 --> 01:12:49.360
- Put him in 13.
- Just a minute, boys. I want to...

01:12:49.428 --> 01:12:51.362
You speak when you're spoken to
around here. Hold up your arm and wait.

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.886
Listen, you...

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:54.365
You say "Mister" when
you're talking to me.

01:12:54.433 --> 01:12:56.867
- Put him in 13 and find him a bunk.
- Come on.

01:12:56.936 --> 01:13:00.373
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Them cost me $16.50.

01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:15.881
- Another Richard Roe, eh?
- There seems to be a lot of them.

01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:19.050
- How's everything at the house, Charlie?
- Fine, Jake.

01:13:19.126 --> 01:13:21.924
- Give my regards to the missus.
- I'll do that little thing.

01:13:24.632 --> 01:13:26.725
- I gotta get out of here.
- Take it easy, boy.

01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:28.735
I'm John L. Sullivan,
a Hollywood director.

01:13:28.803 --> 01:13:30.088
Somebody slugged me. I
gotta get out of here.

01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:31.397
A Hollywood what?

01:13:31.472 --> 01:13:35.067
- Take it easy, will you?
You're gonna lose your privilege.

01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:39.011
No letters, no smokes, no writing.
You don't want that.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.013
I want a lawyer.
You get me to a telephone.

01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:43.015
There's a telephone
right down there.

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:45.176
They can't do things like this
to people. Put 'em in a pigsty.

01:13:45.252 --> 01:13:48.187
Pipe down, will you,
please, before he hears.

01:13:48.255 --> 01:13:51.020
I want a lawyer. I demand
my right to have a lawyer!

01:13:51.092 --> 01:13:53.060
Did you hear that?
He demands a lawyer.

01:13:57.765 --> 01:13:59.699
You starting in again?

01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:02.998
<i>You're gonna be here
a long time, see?</i>

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:06.700
And you gotta learn,
and learn quick.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.384
<i>Chain him in.</i>

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.389
No privilege, fresh guy.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.201
We're going to
the picture show Sunday.

01:15:18.148 --> 01:15:20.378
Good news. You want to see
the picture show Sunday?

01:15:23.453 --> 01:15:25.545
We're going to the picture show.

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:32.557
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
They asked us over again.

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:34.563
- When can I write a letter?
- When you get your privilege back.

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.565
How long will that take?

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.498
That all depends on the Mister.

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:40.502
He's all right
if you take it nice and quiet.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.663
How long does it take him
to make up his mind?

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:46.140
Take it easy, will you,
or you'll never get it.

01:15:57.488 --> 01:15:59.422
<i>Look out!</i>

01:16:02.426 --> 01:16:06.021
Who gave you leave to read the paper?
You won't learn, huh?

01:16:06.096 --> 01:16:08.189
- It's about me. I just happened to see it.
- Shut up!

01:16:08.265 --> 01:16:11.098
Turn around. Turn around!

01:16:11.168 --> 01:16:13.193
Put your hands behind you.

01:16:16.273 --> 01:16:18.241
- Put him in the sweat box.
- For how long, Mister?

01:16:18.309 --> 01:16:21.540
- Till I tell you. Are you gonna start now?
- No. Yes. I mean no, sir.

01:16:21.612 --> 01:16:23.739
Then get moving!

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:30.652
Get back to your work. What do you
think this is, a vaudeville show?

01:16:46.238 --> 01:16:48.502
Tastes good, don't it?

01:16:48.573 --> 01:16:52.065
I'll try to get him
to let you off early.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.345
I ain't supposed to do this.

01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:32.144
- Water.
- You'll be all right.

01:17:32.218 --> 01:17:34.209
You got to learn, that's all.
It ain't so easy at first,

01:17:34.287 --> 01:17:36.721
but after a while
you don't mind.

01:17:36.789 --> 01:17:40.384
We ain't so bad off.
He ain't bad, according to his lights.

01:17:40.459 --> 01:17:42.552
He has to deal with some
pretty tough hombres.

01:17:42.628 --> 01:17:44.596
He got us chicken
last Thanksgiving...

01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:47.599
and some turkey once
for Christmas.

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:50.568
And there ain't another Mister
takes his gang to the picture show.

01:17:50.636 --> 01:17:55.404
Maybe... Maybe if I ask him, he'll
let you go the picture show Sunday.

01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:57.739
Wouldn't that
be something? Huh?

01:18:07.653 --> 01:18:09.587
All right, Charlie.

01:18:12.992 --> 01:18:14.926
Let it down easy, Charlie.

01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:17.963
<i>Charlie's a little anxious.</i>

01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:25.097
Brothers and sisters, once again
we're gonna have a little entertainment.

01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:27.265
I don't have to tell you
what it is.

01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:30.936
The sheet kind of gives it away.

01:18:31.011 --> 01:18:34.538
And once again, brothers and sisters,
we're going to share our pleasure...

01:18:34.615 --> 01:18:38.551
with some neighbors
less fortunate than ourselves.

01:18:38.619 --> 01:18:44.217
Won't you please clear the first
three pews so they may have seats.

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:47.887
And when they get here,
I'm gonna ask you once more,

01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:52.227
neither by word, nor by action,
nor by look...

01:18:52.299 --> 01:18:55.097
to make our guests feel
unwelcome.

01:18:55.168 --> 01:18:59.571
Don't draw away from them
or act high-toned.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.737
- For we is all equal in the sight of God.
- Amen!

01:19:04.811 --> 01:19:09.579
And He said,
"Let him who is without sin...

01:19:09.651 --> 01:19:12.245
" cast the first stone.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.256
"The chains shall
be struck from them!

01:19:16.324 --> 01:19:19.316
"The lame shall leap.

01:19:19.394 --> 01:19:21.919
"The blind shall see!

01:19:21.996 --> 01:19:26.626
And glory in
the coming of the Lord. "

01:19:26.701 --> 01:19:29.898

Will those nearest to the lights
kindly rise and dim them, please.

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.553
How do?

01:23:02.622 --> 01:23:04.556
- Hey.
- Huh?

01:23:04.624 --> 01:23:06.558
Am I laughing?

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.363
You don't suppose
this is a gag, do you?

01:23:52.439 --> 01:23:54.532
He'd have to be a Houdini
to get out of that one.

01:23:54.608 --> 01:23:56.872
Well, I wouldn't
put it past him.

01:23:58.278 --> 01:24:00.212
Don't you understand?

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.510
They think I'm dead,
and I'm not dead.

01:24:02.582 --> 01:24:04.516
Well, that's fine.

01:24:04.584 --> 01:24:07.052
Just think what a nice surprise
they'll have when you get out.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.556
I haven't time
to spend six years.

01:24:10.624 --> 01:24:14.560
- But you were sentenced.
- I know that, but I still haven't time.

01:24:14.628 --> 01:24:16.789
Well, you'll have to find the time.

01:24:16.863 --> 01:24:19.229
Look they don't sentence picture
directors to a place like this...

01:24:19.299 --> 01:24:21.233
for a little disagreement
with a yard bull.

01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:23.235
- Don't they?
- No.

01:24:23.303 --> 01:24:25.237
Oh.

01:24:25.305 --> 01:24:26.590
Well, then, maybe you
ain't a movie director.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:27.899
Huh?

01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:29.910
Maybe that idea
just come to you...

01:24:29.978 --> 01:24:33.072
- when you got hit on the head, maybe.
- Now, look...

01:24:33.147 --> 01:24:36.583
We used to have a fella here
once that thought he was Lindbergh.

01:24:36.651 --> 01:24:39.677
He used to fly away
every night...

01:24:39.754 --> 01:24:43.019
but he was always
back in the morning.

01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:45.685
Don't I look like
a picture director?

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.694
'Course I never seen one.

01:24:47.762 --> 01:24:52.631
You look more like a soda jerk,
or maybe a plasterer, maybe.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.864
But...

01:24:55.938 --> 01:24:57.644
If ever a plot need a
twist, this one does.

01:24:57.657 --> 01:24:59.373
Huh?

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.874
- I gotta get my picture in the paper.
- That would be swell.

01:25:01.943 --> 01:25:03.877
Then you could paste it
over your bunk.

01:25:03.945 --> 01:25:06.379
What kind of people get
their pictures in the paper?

01:25:06.447 --> 01:25:08.381
Ball players?

01:25:09.617 --> 01:25:11.551
Girls? They take 'em
with their legs crossed.

01:25:11.619 --> 01:25:15.055
I cut one out once. She had a...
She was sitting... No?

01:25:16.624 --> 01:25:19.719
When you die,
if you was important enough.

01:25:19.795 --> 01:25:21.888
I've had that.

01:25:21.964 --> 01:25:23.898
Murderers?

01:25:23.966 --> 01:25:26.730
There was a swell picture
of a friend of mine.

01:25:26.802 --> 01:25:28.736
He was a lodge brother.

01:25:28.804 --> 01:25:31.500
They called him
"the blowtorch killer. "

01:25:31.573 --> 01:25:35.065
That's it. That's it!

01:25:35.144 --> 01:25:37.738
You tell the Mister I'm ready
to make a full confession.

01:25:37.813 --> 01:25:39.781
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.

01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:41.782
- Now, take it easy.
- There isn't a moment to lose.

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:43.785
- Now, look...
- I'm... My conscience has got me.

01:25:43.853 --> 01:25:45.258
You're
gonna get...

01:25:45.271 --> 01:25:46.686
I want to confess to the
murder of John L. Sullivan.

01:25:46.756 --> 01:25:49.349
- Wait a minute!
- I killed John L. Sullivan!

01:25:49.425 --> 01:25:51.546
I killed John L.
Sullivan!

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:53.691
I'm telling you, you're
doing the wrong thing.

01:25:53.762 --> 01:25:55.855
- I'm a murderer!
- Will you listen to me before somebody...

01:25:55.931 --> 01:25:57.865
I killed John L. Sullivan!

01:27:38.369 --> 01:27:42.135
- I'm so happy.
- So am I!

01:27:42.206 --> 01:27:45.074
- I said, I'm so happy!
- What?

01:27:45.143 --> 01:27:47.077
Your wife got married last week.

01:27:47.145 --> 01:27:49.079
Who got buried last week?

01:27:49.147 --> 01:27:51.411
She got married last week!

01:27:52.651 --> 01:27:55.085
My wife?
You say they buried her?

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:58.247
No, she got married.
She married your business manager.

01:27:58.323 --> 01:28:00.416
- She married him?
- Yes!

01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:02.426
- He married her?
- Yes!

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.587
- But how?
- Because you were dead.

01:28:04.663 --> 01:28:06.597
- Dead?
- Dead.

01:28:12.004 --> 01:28:13.938
- Do you suppose she'll give you a divorce?
- Give it to me?

01:28:14.006 --> 01:28:16.099
She'll beg me for it. Don't you
understand? She's got to give it to me.

01:28:16.175 --> 01:28:18.109
Otherwise it's bigamy,
unfaithfulness,

01:28:18.177 --> 01:28:20.611
alienation of affection,
corpus delicti.

01:28:23.316 --> 01:28:26.113
- And then you'll be free.
- Then I'll be free.

01:28:26.184 --> 01:28:28.118
But not for long, I hope.

01:28:28.186 --> 01:28:31.121
Just a moment, gentlemen!

01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:33.282
<i>Sully, I just want to tell you that
O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

01:28:33.358 --> 01:28:35.452
is gonna be the greatest
tragedy ever made.

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:37.689
- Well, I...
- The world will weep! Humanity will sob.

01:28:37.763 --> 01:28:39.754
It'll put Shakespeare
back with the shipping news.

01:28:39.832 --> 01:28:41.766
Quiet! Your personal courage,
your sacrifice...

01:28:41.834 --> 01:28:44.064
the lengths to which you went to sample
the bitter dregs of vicissitude...

01:28:44.136 --> 01:28:46.070
<i>will make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
positively...</i>

01:28:46.138 --> 01:28:48.072
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- You're sorry to disappoint me?

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.074
Yes, and I say it
with some embarrassment,

01:28:50.142 --> 01:28:52.906
<i>but I don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:54.913
<i>You don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:57.472
No. I say it with some embarrassment.
I want to make a comedy.

01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:59.746
You say it with some embarrassment?

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.311
<i>He doesn't want to make O Brother, Where
Art Thou? He wants to make a comedy.</i>

01:29:02.389 --> 01:29:05.153
He don't mean that, boss.
He's still a little stir crazy.

01:29:05.225 --> 01:29:07.386
- Oh, yes, I do. Oh, no I'm not!
- You're joking, aren't you?

01:29:07.461 --> 01:29:09.395
- It's in bad taste, but it's a joke?
- No.

01:29:09.463 --> 01:29:11.988
But it's had more publicity
than the Johnstown flood.

01:29:12.065 --> 01:29:14.590
<i>- What are we gonna do?
- Oh, brother.</i>

01:29:14.668 --> 01:29:17.602
<i>Why don't you want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou, Sully?</i>

01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:21.265
<i>In the first place, I'm too happy
to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:24.674
<i>In the second place, I haven't suffered
enough to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>

01:29:24.745 --> 01:29:27.680
- You haven't suffered enough?
- He hasn't suffered enough?

01:29:27.748 --> 01:29:30.273
- But Sully!
- I'll tell you something else.

01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.944
There's a lot to be said
for making people laugh.

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.614
Did you know that's all
some people have?

01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:40.217
It isn't much, but it's better
than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.

01:29:42.129 --> 01:29:44.222
Boy.
