WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:04.970
[Crow caws]

00:04.971 --> 00:07.138
[High-pitched] Ah ha ha ha ha! [Snorts]

00:07.139 --> 00:09.107
What's going on with you?

00:09.108 --> 00:11.610
We already have one weird kid.
That slot is filled.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.012
Okay, I'm trying for senior superlatives.

00:14.013 --> 00:16.982
You know, "most likely to succeed,"
"best laugh."

00:16.983 --> 00:20.118
And it is finally my chance
to make it into the yearbook

00:20.119 --> 00:23.255
On the center fold,
where it naturally opens!

00:23.256 --> 00:25.657
I am telling you, if I want the year of Sue

00:25.658 --> 00:27.359
to be in the yearbook of Sue,

00:27.360 --> 00:30.028
I got to do whatever it
takes to make my mark,

00:30.029 --> 00:33.765
which, in this case,
means working on my laugh.

00:33.766 --> 00:36.334
How about you go for
"most likely to work on it in your room"?

00:36.335 --> 00:38.570
Oh, dad, that is hi-larious.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.972
[Throatily] Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh...

00:40.973 --> 00:43.108
No. I don't like that one, either.
[Microwave beeps]

00:43.109 --> 00:45.443
Okay,
we need something green to go with dinner.

00:45.444 --> 00:47.546
Ooh! We can make ice-pack peas.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.414
They haven't been in there that long.

00:49.415 --> 00:50.615
When was the O.J. Chase?

00:50.616 --> 00:52.083
You know, we really should

00:52.084 --> 00:54.052
buy some fresh vegetables sometimes,
just so w...

00:54.053 --> 00:56.187
[Gasps] Oh, my God.
We forgot Brick's birthday.

00:56.188 --> 00:58.056
- What?
- Brick's birthday... in November!

00:58.057 --> 00:59.357
What month are we in now?

00:59.358 --> 01:01.092
- February.
- [Sighs]

01:01.093 --> 01:02.193
Yeah, that's bad.

01:02.194 --> 01:04.194
You know, it's been so long, at this point,

01:04.196 --> 01:06.598
maybe we should just float it to next year.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.400
That's what we did last year. Ugh!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.502
We're treating him like a leap-year baby.

01:10.503 --> 01:13.004
[Gasps] Sue's birthday...
that's coming up, too!

01:13.005 --> 01:14.172
Oh, seriously,

01:14.173 --> 01:16.174
why do we have two
birthdays so close together?

01:16.175 --> 01:17.476
We didn't.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.544
[Sighs]

01:19.545 --> 01:21.413
Brick, listen...

01:21.414 --> 01:24.316
Um,
I don't even know if you're aware of this,

01:24.317 --> 01:26.585
but, um, it's come to my attention

01:26.586 --> 01:29.254
that it's possible we might
have missed your birthday.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.056
Oh, you did. You definitely did.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.458
[Sighs] Look, Brick, I know it's bad,

01:33.459 --> 01:36.394
and I really don't know
how it even happened,

01:36.395 --> 01:37.996
but at least it wasn't a big one.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.097
It was 13.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.967
What? You turned 13? You can't be 13.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.301
What year were you born?

01:43.302 --> 01:44.970
Wait. When was Scott Peterson?

01:44.971 --> 01:48.006
Oh, my God! 13 is huge!

01:48.007 --> 01:51.142
Brick, I am sorry. I am so, so sorry.

01:51.143 --> 01:53.111
Yeah,
I kind of thought since it was a biggie,

01:53.112 --> 01:54.179
you would have done something.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.480
But it's fine.

01:55.481 --> 01:57.083
I had a party with my books.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.723
[Gasps] He-e-y!

02:04.724 --> 02:07.092
Hey. What's wrong with your back?

02:07.093 --> 02:08.994
[Laughs] Nothing.

02:08.995 --> 02:12.631
So... what... Is... Up?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.232
[Giggles]

02:14.233 --> 02:18.069
What? Am I being a big flirt?

02:18.070 --> 02:22.107
Maybe even the biggest
flirt in the senior class?

02:22.108 --> 02:23.375
- [Clank]
- [Gasps]

02:23.376 --> 02:24.709
Ohh! Ohh.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.211
Ahh.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.313
Sue, I am the wrong person
for you to be flirting with.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.116
I'm on the committee that counts the votes.
It wouldn't look right.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.385
Well, if I want to be best flirt,

02:33.386 --> 02:35.587
I need someone to flirt with.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.123
Hey, look. There's Riley.
I bet he'd be fun to flirt with.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.457
Just guessing. No reason.

02:39.458 --> 02:40.660
Mmmmm.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.129
Hey, Riley.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.296
Are you bleeding?

02:45.297 --> 02:48.299
You tell me. Am I bleeding?

02:48.300 --> 02:50.035
I just did. You're bleeding.

02:50.036 --> 02:50.736
Oh!

02:51.604 --> 02:53.304
Oh, my God. I'm bleeding.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.073
I got to go to the nurse.

02:55.074 --> 02:58.344
[Giggles] But I'll catch
up with you la-ter.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.151
Ashley: Hello, Axl.

03:06.152 --> 03:06.985
[Gasps]

03:06.986 --> 03:08.453
You!

03:08.454 --> 03:09.988
Wake up. Wake up!

03:09.989 --> 03:12.057
[Sniffles] What are you doing here?

03:12.058 --> 03:13.758
I go to school here now. I transferred.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.560
The white dolphin told me in a dream

03:15.561 --> 03:18.997
that if I was patient,
we would find each other again.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.166
Plus,
they have a good hotel-management program.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.368
Sorry. I had my earbuds in.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.537
- Hey. You met Ashley.
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.039
Axl was my boyfriend in high school.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.041
Oh. Really?

03:30.042 --> 03:32.544
Well... I'm with Devin now.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.512
So, good to see you.

03:34.513 --> 03:36.114
[Laughs nervously]

03:36.115 --> 03:37.316
Please don't hurt us.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.985
Whoa! You dated Ashley?

03:40.986 --> 03:42.587
This whole time, I was telling you about

03:42.588 --> 03:45.090
the strange wizard girl who
moved in across the hall,

03:45.091 --> 03:47.225
and it turns out she was
your high-school girlfriend?

03:47.226 --> 03:49.027
[Chuckles] Okay, that's awesome.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.096
No! [Laughing] No, no!

03:51.097 --> 03:52.564
Weird Ashley was not my girlfriend.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.399
It's all in her head.
She's obsessed with me.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.101
[Groans] I can't even believe she's here!

03:56.102 --> 03:58.136
Hey, it's cool. We all got a past.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.106
[Chuckles] Honestly,
I would not have pegged her as your type.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.340
But I did date an eagle scout

04:02.341 --> 04:04.042
who once wore all 40 badges on a date,

04:04.043 --> 04:06.177
so, yeah,
no need to be embarrassed about it.

04:06.178 --> 04:08.246
Uh, I'm not embarrassed about dating her,

04:08.247 --> 04:10.048
'cause I never dated her!

04:10.049 --> 04:11.583
Shush!

04:11.584 --> 04:13.285
Stop talking. She could be listening.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.021
I can't believe we forgot Brick's birthday.

04:17.022 --> 04:18.156
We do this all the time,

04:18.156 --> 04:21.291
and now we did it on his 13th birthday.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.393
And now it's over,

04:22.394 --> 04:24.729
and it's just what we do, and it's sad.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.398
Hey, if he really cared,
he'd have spoken up.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.100
He doesn't care that much.

04:29.101 --> 04:30.735
So just forgive yourself.

04:30.736 --> 04:32.137
[Scoffs] Forgive myself?

04:32.138 --> 04:34.072
What do you mean, "forgive myself"?

04:34.073 --> 04:35.507
It should be "forgive ourselves."

04:35.508 --> 04:37.375
You forgot his birthday, too, you know.

04:37.376 --> 04:40.612
Eh. Remembering birthdays
is more of a mom thing.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.980
Really? Tell me what isn't a mom thing.

04:42.981 --> 04:45.049
I take care of them when they're sick,

04:45.050 --> 04:46.284
I drive them everywhere.

04:46.285 --> 04:48.419
I ask the parents with good cameras

04:48.420 --> 04:50.421
to take pictures of them at school events.

04:50.422 --> 04:53.357
Why am I the one who always
has to be the monkey arms?

04:53.358 --> 04:54.525
"Monkey arms"?

04:54.526 --> 04:56.994
Yeah, you know, monkey arms...
from animal planet.

04:56.995 --> 04:59.464
The mom chimpanzee makes
this bridge with her arms

04:59.465 --> 05:00.765
so all the little baby monkeys

05:00.766 --> 05:02.433
can get from one tree to the next.

05:02.434 --> 05:04.268
Yeah, and what is the dad doing?

05:04.269 --> 05:06.037
Just sitting there, scratching his butt.

05:06.038 --> 05:07.371
[Chuckles]

05:07.372 --> 05:09.407
Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.609
No, no, no, no. You're in this, too, pal.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.377
You've got longer limbs than anybody.

05:13.378 --> 05:15.646
Put your monkey arms where
your mouth is and think.

05:15.647 --> 05:17.615
Hey, here's a crazy thought.

05:17.616 --> 05:19.984
What if we ask Brick what he wants?

05:19.985 --> 05:21.452
Brick!

05:21.453 --> 05:23.454
Look at you with your good ideas.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.289
[Door opens]

05:25.290 --> 05:29.290
Brick, your dad and I feel really,
really bad

05:29.628 --> 05:31.295
about forgetting your birthday.

05:31.296 --> 05:32.296
Oh, it's okay.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.298
All right. Sleep tight, buddy.

05:34.299 --> 05:35.466
No, it's not okay.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.635
Your 13th birthday is a big deal.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.871
You're about to become a teenager.

05:39.872 --> 05:42.273
I've been a teenager for three months.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.608
[Sighs] Right.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.443
And t-that's why we've decided

05:45.444 --> 05:47.478
that you can do whatever you want.

05:47.479 --> 05:49.614
Your choice, Brick... anything at all.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.749
Really? Hmm.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.285
Well, some kids at my
school have bowling parties.

05:54.286 --> 05:55.620
I mean, I've never been invited,

05:55.621 --> 05:57.421
but they talk about them in front of me,

05:57.422 --> 05:58.322
and it sounds pretty fun.

05:58.323 --> 06:00.826
Okay, then. Bowling party it is.

06:02.027 --> 06:03.427
Well, look at that...

06:03.428 --> 06:05.997
something the kids might actually come to.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.331
And it has a bar.

06:07.332 --> 06:09.334
- Monkey arm high five!
- Whoo!

06:10.302 --> 06:11.269
Miss.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.871
There you go. Got it.

06:16.608 --> 06:18.276
So, what do you think?

06:18.277 --> 06:20.011
Best hair, huh?

06:20.012 --> 06:21.913
Wow. Yeah, beautiful.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.448
But maybe a little dramatic for school.

06:24.449 --> 06:25.983
Oh, I have to be dramatic.

06:25.984 --> 06:28.052
I am competing against Carrie Carmona,

06:28.053 --> 06:30.588
who has the best beachy
waves in all of Orson,

06:30.589 --> 06:32.290
so I really got to bring it.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.058
[Gasps] And bonus...

06:34.059 --> 06:36.360
it covers the gash on my scalp.

06:36.361 --> 06:37.563
Wish me luck.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.766
Okay, Brick. Here's your invitations.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.334
Make sure you pass them out

06:43.335 --> 06:44.869
and look everyone in the eye, okay?

06:44.870 --> 06:46.504
Oh. And mention the free game tokens.

06:46.505 --> 06:48.039
That's a big seller with the kids,

06:48.040 --> 06:49.373
and not everybody does that.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.342
Got it. Totally under control.

06:51.343 --> 06:53.912
Brick... invitations.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.615
Oh. Right.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.785
'Sup?

07:00.786 --> 07:03.020
Sorry I'm late.
Got accosted in the hall by your ex.

07:03.021 --> 07:04.488
I don't know who you're talking about,

07:04.489 --> 07:05.790
'cause I don't have any ex-girlfriends

07:05.791 --> 07:06.857
that go to this school.

07:06.858 --> 07:08.693
Yeah, well, she just showed me pictures

07:08.694 --> 07:10.761
from three different
proms that say otherwise.

07:10.762 --> 07:13.464
Admit it... you were a nerd in high school.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.066
Oh, my God! You're nuts!
I mean, look at me!

07:15.067 --> 07:17.702
There's no way I would have
ever dated weird Ashley.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.971
Okay, I got to stop you a sec
'cause it's kind of obnoxious

07:19.972 --> 07:21.472
you keep calling her "weird Ashley."

07:21.473 --> 07:22.907
Sorry, but that's her name.

07:22.908 --> 07:25.309
I got to distinguish her from
hot Ashley and smart Ashley.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.978
I mean, look,
it's just a classification system.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.579
You know, I don't know if I love the way

07:28.580 --> 07:30.047
I'm hearing you talk about people.

07:30.048 --> 07:31.349
What?

07:31.350 --> 07:32.917
"Smart Ashley," "hot Ashley"...

07:32.918 --> 07:34.385
kind of wondering if you have

07:34.386 --> 07:36.554
an insulting little
nickname like that for me.

07:36.555 --> 07:38.389
[Scoffs] Okay...

07:38.390 --> 07:40.324
- Do you?
- No!

07:40.325 --> 07:41.292
[Cellphone rings] What are you...

07:41.293 --> 07:42.860
don't... ugh!

07:42.861 --> 07:44.629
"Uggo from Idaho"?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.330
Okay, that was before I met you.

07:46.331 --> 07:48.933
I swear I was gonna change it to
"rockin' body Devin."

07:48.934 --> 07:50.501
Right. Who else do you have in here?

07:50.502 --> 07:51.502
Nobody.

07:51.503 --> 07:52.670
"Super dork don't answer"?

07:52.671 --> 07:54.505
Okay, that's my sister. That's allowed.

07:54.506 --> 07:56.907
And hey, did you hear me?
I said you have a rockin' body.

07:56.908 --> 07:58.042
You should be thanking me.

07:58.043 --> 08:00.344
Oh, my God! Do you even hear yourself?

08:00.345 --> 08:02.346
I mean, I knew you were kind of a jerk

08:02.347 --> 08:03.481
when I first met you, but...

08:03.482 --> 08:04.915
Ha! "Jerk's" a name.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.917
That's a means of classifying people,
and you're doing it.

08:06.918 --> 08:09.620
You called me a name right now.
Ba-bam! Your witness.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.322
- What?
- Hey, you're the one who started this.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.491
You're the one who's freaking
out about what's in my phone.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.559
I'm not freaking out about
what's in your phone.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.596
I'm freaking out about
the guy who put it there.

08:18.597 --> 08:19.665
Me?

08:24.403 --> 08:26.971
Brick, what happened?
You didn't hand them out.

08:26.972 --> 08:28.806
I did, but then I got to thinking...

08:28.807 --> 08:31.042
you said I could do whatever
I want for my birthday.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.544
I believe the quote was "anything at all."

08:33.544 --> 08:35.913
So I realized I don't want a big party.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.283
What I really want is just
to spend time with my family.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.583
Oh, that's so sweet.

08:40.585 --> 08:41.585
Yeah.

08:41.586 --> 08:43.453
I've decided I'd like a whole day

08:43.455 --> 08:45.589
where my family gives me
their undivided attention

08:45.590 --> 08:48.025
so I can share the things
that are of interest to me.

08:48.026 --> 08:49.694
A whole day, huh?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.662
Are you sure that's what you want, Brick?

08:51.663 --> 08:54.465
You know, I wouldn't rule out go-karting.

You only turn 13 and 3 months once.

08:56.768 --> 08:59.371

Go, Hens!

09:10.282 --> 09:11.349

09:11.350 --> 09:12.683
That was a teacher.

09:12.684 --> 09:13.818
Okay.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.953

but I've heard

09:15.954 --> 09:19.323

turned in their voting sheets.

09:19.324 --> 09:20.725
Sorry, Sue, but Sarah McCrosky's

09:20.726 --> 09:22.393
pretty much locked for "most spirited."

09:22.394 --> 09:24.028
- What?!
- Look, I get it.

09:24.029 --> 09:25.930
I thought I was a shoo-in for
"most talented,"

09:25.931 --> 09:28.032
but that football player
Randy wolf is gonna get it.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.667
Since when is athletic prowess a talent?

09:29.668 --> 09:31.869

09:31.870 --> 09:33.437
Now, that's a talent.

09:33.438 --> 09:35.406
So, Sarah McCrosky's got homecoming queen,

09:35.407 --> 09:36.540

09:36.541 --> 09:38.542
and now she's getting "most spirited"?

09:38.543 --> 09:42.279
It's almost like it's some
kind of popularity contest.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.914
Maybe this just isn't our time, Sue.

09:43.915 --> 09:45.916
You and I are gonna come out in college.

09:45.917 --> 09:48.619

10:27.359 --> 10:30.361
So we had a fight at a movie theater.
Big deal.

10:30.362 --> 10:32.296
Yeah. We fought, and it's over.

[Door closes]

16:33.760 --> 16:35.590
I had to pay attention. I had to.

16:35.591 --> 16:37.189
[Brick speaking indistinctly]
I'm a horrible mother.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.902
Stay awake, Frankie.
You forgot your son's birthday.

16:39.903 --> 16:42.534
You're in the homestretch.
Just stay with it.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.370
Sergeant McKenna lost over 200
men that day to mustard gas.

16:46.371 --> 16:48.188
Their names in alphabetical order

16:48.189 --> 16:51.513
are Edward Albrecht, George Allenrod...

16:51.514 --> 16:52.855
Okay, I will kill you!

16:52.856 --> 16:54.511
Why are you doing this to me?!

16:54.512 --> 16:55.846
Everybody forgot! Everybody!

16:55.847 --> 16:57.581
But oh, no, it has to come to me

16:57.582 --> 16:59.716
'cause I'm the mom and I must be punished!

16:59.717 --> 17:01.084
Well, you know what?

17:01.085 --> 17:02.586
I've done my time!

17:02.587 --> 17:04.988
When you think back to all the
things I've done for you...

17:04.989 --> 17:06.823
all the teachers meetings I've sat through,

17:06.824 --> 17:09.126
all the places I've gone,
trying to get you to be normal...

17:09.127 --> 17:11.462
my account is paid!

17:19.804 --> 17:21.839
[Sighs]

17:27.545 --> 17:28.612
Oh. [Chuckles]

17:28.613 --> 17:30.914
Uh...

17:30.915 --> 17:32.115
Hi.

17:32.116 --> 17:34.518
Maybe think about putting
a heat lamp out here,

17:34.519 --> 17:37.689
in case people wind up waiting
forever for you to get home.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.391
I'm confused. Are we...

17:41.392 --> 17:43.528
Freezing our butts off? Yeah. We are.

17:44.529 --> 17:46.129
Okay, fine. I'm bad at this, all right?

17:46.130 --> 17:47.597
I'm great at picking fights,

17:47.598 --> 17:49.733
but I'm terrible at the
part that comes after.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.435
Look, I'm the one that screwed up.

17:51.436 --> 17:53.370
You were right about the names and stuff.

17:53.371 --> 17:55.472
I changed all the contacts in my phone.

17:55.473 --> 17:59.509
Wait...
so I'm not "uggo from Idaho" anymore?

17:59.510 --> 18:00.777
I'm just playin' "Devin"?

18:00.778 --> 18:02.980
Well... For now.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.748
Maybe I'm waiting to
see how this turns out.

18:04.749 --> 18:06.016
You could be "awesome Devin,"

18:06.017 --> 18:07.718
or you could be "big bowl of crazy Devin."

18:07.719 --> 18:09.619
[Chuckles]

18:09.620 --> 18:11.088
Here's the thing.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.523
I got majorly burned by my last boyfriend.

18:13.524 --> 18:14.858
I thought everything was going great,

18:14.859 --> 18:16.493
until one day, I was late for practice,

18:16.494 --> 18:18.428
and I borrowed one of his old jerseys.

18:18.429 --> 18:19.763
No big deal, right?

18:19.764 --> 18:21.698
But then, that night,
I get this text from him

18:21.699 --> 18:23.900
saying that the jersey thing
had sent him over the edge

18:23.901 --> 18:25.836
and things were going
too fast and it was over.

18:25.837 --> 18:27.471
Totally out of the blue.

18:27.472 --> 18:28.438
And it sucked.

18:28.439 --> 18:32.809
So now, at the first sign of any trouble,
I bail.

18:32.810 --> 18:35.612
I'd rather be the dumper than the dumpee.

18:35.613 --> 18:36.680
Okay.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.615
Well...

18:38.616 --> 18:39.883
Follow me here.

18:39.884 --> 18:43.720
What if we keep doing this...

18:43.721 --> 18:45.589
which I think is pretty awesome...

18:45.590 --> 18:48.692
and if things start going south,
I'll let you know,

18:48.693 --> 18:50.494
and you can dump me first?

18:50.495 --> 18:51.928
Cool?

18:51.929 --> 18:53.497
Cool.

18:53.498 --> 18:54.165
Okay.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.074

19:03.141 --> 19:05.809
Brick, listen, I'm sorry.

19:05.810 --> 19:06.843
It's okay.

19:06.844 --> 19:08.712
I could tell you really weren't interested

19:08.713 --> 19:10.647
in what I had to say anyway.

19:10.648 --> 19:11.948
People often aren't.

19:11.949 --> 19:13.784
But the reason I kept you for last

19:13.785 --> 19:15.052
is because you're the person

19:15.053 --> 19:17.454
I don't get to spend as
much time with as I want to.

19:17.455 --> 19:19.389
Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:19.390 --> 19:20.457
[Sighs]

19:20.458 --> 19:21.925
Brick, h-here's the thing.

19:21.926 --> 19:23.960
I was just tired, you know.

19:23.961 --> 19:26.530
And I didn't mean that thing about
"normal."

19:26.531 --> 19:28.732
Who's normal? No one in this house.

19:28.733 --> 19:29.866
I guess when you said

19:29.867 --> 19:32.102
I could have anything I
wanted for my birthday,

19:32.103 --> 19:33.904
I got a little drunk with power.

19:33.905 --> 19:35.072
I was pushing it.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.406
No, Brick, really.

19:36.407 --> 19:39.142
This is what you wanted for your birthday,
and I blew it,

19:39.143 --> 19:42.080
and [Sighs] I'm just sorry.

19:43.414 --> 19:45.015
Hey.

19:45.016 --> 19:46.950
What other words have all the vowels

19:46.951 --> 19:48.685
besides that no-lips thing?

19:48.686 --> 19:49.519
Oh.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.822
Well, there's "abstemious,"

19:51.823 --> 19:53.857
"arsenious," "facetious"...

19:53.858 --> 19:55.425
- Oh, "facetious."
- Mm-hmm.

19:55.426 --> 19:56.526
Sure. That makes sense.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.395
Yeah. Yeah, I hadn't thought of that one.

19:58.396 --> 19:59.763
Mm.

19:59.764 --> 20:01.965
How do you find the words?
Do you just Google them or what?

20:01.966 --> 20:03.367
I did. But you know what?

20:05.938 --> 20:08.814
All: With liberty and justice for all.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.717
Thank you, sergeant at arms.
Super-inspiring, as uzhe.

20:14.718 --> 20:16.694
And now, as head of the yearbook committee,

20:16.695 --> 20:18.328
it is my job and my honor

20:18.329 --> 20:19.978
to announcer our senior superlatives.

20:19.979 --> 20:21.021
[Applause] I'm sorry, Brad.

20:21.022 --> 20:22.619
Could I just say something?

20:22.620 --> 20:26.377
[Feedback] You know, we all get
caught up in senior superlatives,

20:26.378 --> 20:28.033
but the truth is,

20:28.034 --> 20:31.127
it's always the popular
people who win these things.

20:31.128 --> 20:32.625
But it shouldn't be.

20:32.626 --> 20:33.614
D... w-w-w...

20:33.615 --> 20:35.675
we're all "best smile."

20:35.676 --> 20:39.515
We are all "most spirited."

20:39.516 --> 20:42.353
We are the class of 2015,

20:42.354 --> 20:44.793
and we have been on this journey together!

20:44.794 --> 20:47.737
So please, I urge you,

20:47.738 --> 20:51.210
if you are someone like me,
who believes in class unity,

20:51.211 --> 20:53.729
then don't come up here
and accept this award!

20:53.730 --> 20:55.442
Send a message

20:55.443 --> 20:59.698
that these labels and
this system are wrong!

20:59.699 --> 21:01.258
Thank you.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.658
[Scattered applause]

21:04.659 --> 21:05.711
Okay.

21:05.712 --> 21:07.647
Well, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do now,

21:07.648 --> 21:09.555
because the winner for
"best laugh" is Sue Heck.

21:09.556 --> 21:11.790
[Chuckles] [Gasps]

21:11.791 --> 21:15.901
[Scattered applause]

21:15.902 --> 21:18.380
Okay, so, before I don't accept this award,

21:18.381 --> 21:20.732
let's just take a second
and think about this.

21:20.733 --> 21:23.155
[Nervously] Eh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

21:23.156 --> 21:24.938
[Scattered applause]
