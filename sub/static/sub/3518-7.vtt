WEBVTT

01:40.481 --> 01:44.069
Do you renew your commitment to this
woman as your lawful wedded wife,

01:44.152 --> 01:47.947
to love her, honor her, comfort her,

01:48.031 --> 01:50.616
keep her in sickness and in health,

01:50.700 --> 01:55.038
forsaking all others, be true to her,
as long as you both shall live?

01:56.455 --> 01:57.456
I do.

01:58.499 --> 02:01.127
Do you renew
your commitment to this man

02:01.211 --> 02:02.795
as your lawful wedded husband,

02:02.879 --> 02:06.382
to love him, honor him, comfort him,

02:06.465 --> 02:09.259
keep him in sickness and in health,

02:09.342 --> 02:14.057
forsaking all others, be true to him,
as long as you both shall live?

02:15.308 --> 02:16.851
I do.

02:16.935 --> 02:20.313
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other

02:20.396 --> 02:23.108
and strengthen your eternal bond.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

02:42.168 --> 02:43.460
Francis?

02:46.631 --> 02:49.968
No photographs when they unload his body.
Will you promise me that?

03:21.916 --> 03:24.418
A lot of people are calling you a hero.

03:26.254 --> 03:28.173
A lot of people aren't.

03:52.113 --> 03:54.448
Francis, I will get this
peacekeeping resolution

03:54.532 --> 03:56.576
passed through the General Assembly.

03:59.453 --> 04:00.955
I owe you that.

04:04.876 --> 04:08.838
So we have the photograph tomorrow
for the presidential portrait.

04:08.921 --> 04:11.424
It's what they're gonna
base the painting on.

04:14.510 --> 04:16.762
I'll be smiling. Will you?

04:24.187 --> 04:25.771
What are they doing?

04:25.855 --> 04:29.275
Part of a...
cultural exchange, sir, with Tibet.

04:29.359 --> 04:31.152
They'll be here for a month.

04:31.236 --> 04:32.570
A month?

05:10.900 --> 05:13.027
Don't worry,
your handwriting's atrocious.

05:13.111 --> 05:14.695
Couldn't read a thing.

05:14.779 --> 05:17.240
- Tom.
- I know. Kate Baldwin.

05:17.323 --> 05:18.408
I know.

05:18.491 --> 05:19.617
Oh. Gold stars for us.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.204
It only took two months riding
on the same plane to introduce ourselves.

05:23.288 --> 05:24.872
Maybe I'm shy.

05:24.956 --> 05:27.459
Oh, no, you're not.
You just don't mingle with the peasants.

05:27.541 --> 05:30.920
If one of us is a peasant,
I think it's me.

05:42.223 --> 05:45.518
I'm sorry I can't stay here
in Gaffney with you.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.228
It's okay.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.021
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:49.105 --> 05:52.317
Maybe tonight, if all goes well.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.527
Feeling optimistic?

05:54.610 --> 05:56.404
I made you a promise.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.700
Well, go on.
You have a plane waiting.

06:04.537 --> 06:05.830
Thank you.

06:09.667 --> 06:10.668
Tom.

06:29.979 --> 06:33.274
The Republicans are introducing
a bill that amends the Stafford Act.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.943
They say that the siphoning
of FEMA funds for America Works

06:36.027 --> 06:38.070
- violates the appropriation.
- So let them.

06:38.154 --> 06:39.989
It's got bipartisan support.

06:40.072 --> 06:42.033
Dunbar's going to publicly
support the bill.

06:42.116 --> 06:44.076
- What about Jackie?
- She's trying to stay out of it,

06:44.160 --> 06:46.412
but if it goes to a vote,
she's gotta go with the tide.

06:46.496 --> 06:49.499
We don't want her poll numbers to take
a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.

06:49.582 --> 06:52.918
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.

06:53.002 --> 06:55.602
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,
we'll have jobs to show,

06:55.671 --> 06:58.550
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
This is a public relations battle,

06:58.632 --> 07:00.176
- not a legal one.
- Statement?

07:00.259 --> 07:02.261
Just what I just said, less combative.

07:03.221 --> 07:05.557
So, how do we want to do this?

07:05.639 --> 07:08.017
I think the First Lady should sit.
You behind her.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.977
Does that work for you,
Mrs. Underwood?

07:10.061 --> 07:12.397
Uh, yes, whatever works best.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.024
Let me adjust the light for her,
and then I'll place you, sir.

07:16.359 --> 07:19.571
The African bloc just added a provision
to the peacekeeping resolution.

07:19.653 --> 07:21.239
What does it say?

07:21.322 --> 07:25.243
Requires African command of the forces.
It's a poison pill, Francis.

07:25.326 --> 07:29.038
There's no way Israel or Palestine
will get on board with that.

07:29.121 --> 07:30.873
You think the Russians are behind it?

07:30.956 --> 07:33.834
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.

07:33.918 --> 07:36.629
All right, Mr. President.
Just behind your wife, please.

07:43.469 --> 07:44.970
Do you prefer I not?

07:45.054 --> 07:46.097
What?

07:47.056 --> 07:48.933
Where you had your hand is perfect.

07:50.309 --> 07:52.895
Great. All right.
Here we go.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.816
A little more of a smile, please.

08:01.904 --> 08:04.449
Come in.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.623
Any luck today?

08:11.705 --> 08:15.042
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.129
Not that I trust him.

08:19.672 --> 08:23.509
So now I just need to see
if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.

08:26.679 --> 08:30.308
Today, when we took the photo...

08:32.518 --> 08:33.977
I touched your shoulder.

08:35.270 --> 08:36.897
Yes?

08:38.065 --> 08:39.775
You flinched.

08:40.610 --> 08:42.486
- What?
- I felt it.

08:44.071 --> 08:45.573
No, I didn't.

08:47.325 --> 08:48.742
It was like...

08:50.662 --> 08:52.246
you recoiled.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.586
I think you're reading
too much into something

08:58.670 --> 09:01.297
that I don't think actually happened.

09:04.509 --> 09:07.011
All right. Forget I said anything.

09:09.388 --> 09:10.640
Wait.

09:12.016 --> 09:13.434
I just...

09:15.894 --> 09:17.980
Never mind.
I don't know what I was gonna say.

09:26.780 --> 09:27.990
Good night.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.960
House must've been somewhere out there.

10:22.044 --> 10:25.381
Well, if you can call it a house.
It was no bigger than that truck.

10:26.257 --> 10:29.510
Nothing left of the farm,
which is for the best.

10:29.594 --> 10:32.513
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.

10:32.597 --> 10:34.766
That's what you get for planting on land

10:34.848 --> 10:39.061
with solid rock
two feet below the topsoil.

10:39.144 --> 10:41.785
You know, that's one of the points
that we should make in the book,

10:41.814 --> 10:45.651
that hard work is only worth it
in the right conditions.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.320
We want to set people up for success.

10:48.404 --> 10:51.907
Vocational training,
legitimate career paths.

10:59.624 --> 11:01.667
Welcome back. How was Gaffney?

11:01.751 --> 11:04.211
Do we have a time set
for Ambassador Caspi yet?

11:04.295 --> 11:06.046
Her office is stalling.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.965
Get her schedule.
We'll go wherever she is.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.050
I think she'll be
at the cocktail reception tonight

11:10.134 --> 11:12.637
- at the Mexican Consulate.
- I'll call and find out.

11:13.596 --> 11:15.180
What's that?

11:15.264 --> 11:16.974
It came in for you this morning.

11:17.057 --> 11:18.350
Francis?

11:18.434 --> 11:20.853
John Pasternak.
Michael Corrigan's husband.

11:20.936 --> 11:24.231
The latest pile of interview requests
is on your desk,

11:24.315 --> 11:26.275
most of them Corrigan related.

11:26.358 --> 11:29.987
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote
speaker at their Media Awards Ceremony.

11:30.070 --> 11:31.405
How did he know?

11:31.489 --> 11:33.699
About your vows?
It's been in the news.

11:33.783 --> 11:36.577
No, that I liked tulips.

11:44.543 --> 11:47.880
- Did your mother work?
- As a maid, mostly.

11:47.963 --> 11:50.132
- In high demand, because she was white.
- Mm-hm.

11:50.215 --> 11:53.969
People assumed she wouldn't steal
any valuables, but of course she did.

11:54.052 --> 11:55.929
Uh-huh.

11:56.013 --> 12:00.476
I remember one night, she came home
with two sapphire earrings.

12:00.559 --> 12:03.312
She took them to the pawn shop
in Spartanburg the next day,

12:03.395 --> 12:06.482
but she wore them all night long,
even slept in them.

12:07.733 --> 12:10.695
I guess she wanted to know
what it felt like to have real jewelry,

12:10.778 --> 12:12.697
even if it was just for a few hours.

12:12.780 --> 12:15.867
That does not go in the book.

12:17.660 --> 12:19.453
Why didn't your parents
have any more kids?

12:19.537 --> 12:21.137
That's not relevant to what we're doing.

12:21.163 --> 12:22.963
I'm just trying to get a sense
of your family.

12:22.998 --> 12:25.167
The barn must've been
somewhere right over there.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.962
My father used to escape
in there to get away from us.

12:29.046 --> 12:31.006
Usually brought a bottle with him.

12:31.089 --> 12:32.884
Did you love your father?

12:32.966 --> 12:35.260
He was a good man, down deep.

12:35.344 --> 12:36.929
He cared for us greatly.

12:37.012 --> 12:39.014
Worked hard to put food on the table.

12:39.097 --> 12:42.017
Didn't always succeed,
but that wasn't for a lack of trying.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.812
See... that's not an answer.

12:45.897 --> 12:48.190
I asked you if you loved your father,
you don't tell me.

12:48.273 --> 12:50.526
You tell me what you want me to write.

12:50.609 --> 12:52.945
Which is what you've done
since the beginning.

12:53.028 --> 12:54.988
It's time to start telling the truth.

12:55.072 --> 12:57.491
- You think I've been lying?
- I know you have.

12:57.575 --> 13:01.579
The only time you haven't
is that one night in the White House.

13:01.662 --> 13:04.331
The worst adventure
I've ever been on. I can promise you...

13:04.415 --> 13:06.876
- I don't get it.
- The game is unwinnable.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.588
- What is the point?
- That is the point.

13:11.756 --> 13:15.133
I find it unlikely that we'll ever
progress by starting over and over again.

13:15.217 --> 13:17.261
- But it's got to be better than this.
- Oh, God.

13:17.344 --> 13:19.304
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?

13:20.806 --> 13:23.517
- Something was very clear.
- It just started over again.

13:23.601 --> 13:25.644
It keeps doing that over and over.

13:25.728 --> 13:28.272
Ignore his instructions,
he sends you back.

13:28.355 --> 13:30.441
What if I follow his instructions?

13:30.524 --> 13:33.903
- Hm... Chaos takes over. Randomness.
- Ah.

13:33.986 --> 13:36.906
It's impossible to follow the rules.

13:36.989 --> 13:39.658
Another time.
It's too much like my real life.

13:39.742 --> 13:41.577
Mm...

13:41.660 --> 13:45.623
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.
You should be asking me questions.

13:45.706 --> 13:48.333
You're getting me drunk.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.920
- I won't remember what I asked.
- Mm...

13:52.379 --> 13:55.841
The last time I got this drunk,
I broke into a library.

13:55.925 --> 13:58.844
- In Charleston, my alma mater.
- Hm...

13:58.928 --> 14:00.596
The Sentinel.

14:00.679 --> 14:03.098
I almost puked all over myself.

14:03.181 --> 14:04.934
That's Chapter Eight:
"POTUS Blows Chunks."

14:09.104 --> 14:10.773
Can you keep it down, please?

14:12.316 --> 14:14.234
- Come join us.
- So sorry.

14:14.318 --> 14:16.570
- I was asleep.
- Oh. We'll...

14:16.654 --> 14:18.697
- We'll move into the study.
- Thank you.

14:37.842 --> 14:39.384
Francis?

14:40.344 --> 14:42.304
I'll be right there in a minute.

14:44.932 --> 14:47.142
I don't like him being up here.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.937
We'll be more quiet.

14:50.021 --> 14:52.064
This is our private space.

14:52.147 --> 14:55.359
- He's my guest.
- He's a stranger.

14:57.361 --> 15:00.906
All right. After tonight, no more.

15:01.866 --> 15:03.868
I'm not being unreasonable.

15:08.121 --> 15:10.207
I should've...

15:10.290 --> 15:14.045
realized how much noise we were making.

15:17.422 --> 15:19.550
Can I ask you a question?

15:19.633 --> 15:22.427
Well, that's what you're here for,
isn't it?

15:26.515 --> 15:27.995
Why don't you sleep in the same room?

15:33.397 --> 15:37.275
Uh, that just sorta happened over...

15:37.359 --> 15:40.404
a few months after we moved in here.

15:40.487 --> 15:42.031
Everything okay?

15:42.114 --> 15:43.407
Between you two?

15:43.490 --> 15:44.700
Oh, you bet.

15:48.495 --> 15:50.497
Well, it's been better.

15:54.376 --> 15:57.337
No, it's not okay.

15:57.421 --> 16:02.009
The fight.
Coming back from Moscow.

16:03.510 --> 16:05.596
You heard us?

16:05.679 --> 16:07.890
The yelling. Not what you said.

16:07.973 --> 16:11.226
Hm...

16:12.644 --> 16:14.772
We don't fight often, but, uh...

16:20.569 --> 16:22.154
This one...

16:24.448 --> 16:26.533
scabs keep coming off.

16:26.617 --> 16:28.035
Hm.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.371
We said things.

16:34.083 --> 16:37.044
Things you just can't take back.

16:40.297 --> 16:42.466
It's late. We should call it a night.

16:55.479 --> 16:57.106
Thomas.

17:00.776 --> 17:03.487
I have no interest in salaciousness.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.248
August fourteenth
is the anniversary of the New Deal.

17:15.332 --> 17:18.585
- I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.
- I believe we can do that, sir.

17:18.669 --> 17:21.839
Remy, what's the timeline
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?

17:21.922 --> 17:24.883
The Leg office predicts the Senate
version will pass in two to three weeks.

17:24.883 --> 17:27.886
Working with friendlies in the House.
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.

17:27.970 --> 17:30.097
That's all the more reason
that we need to accelerate.

17:30.181 --> 17:31.598
If I'm gonna veto this bill,

17:31.682 --> 17:35.352
I want it to be because
it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.

17:35.435 --> 17:37.312
- Jobs that we created.
- Yes, sir.

17:37.395 --> 17:38.522
Cathy?

17:38.605 --> 17:41.483
The Russians remain intransigent
on the Jordan Valley.

17:41.566 --> 17:45.320
The ambassador is working hard to push
the peacekeeping resolution to a vote

17:45.403 --> 17:47.322
- by the General Assembly.
- Why the delay?

17:47.405 --> 17:49.825
We're having a hard time
getting the African bloc

17:49.908 --> 17:51.618
to remove the poison pill provision.

17:51.702 --> 17:54.038
We think Israel's behind it.
They got cold feet,

17:54.121 --> 17:57.624
convinced the African bloc to sabotage
the resolution so they have an out.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.626
Do I need to speak
to the Prime Minister?

17:59.710 --> 18:02.046
Uh, the Israeli ambassador
has already denied.

18:02.129 --> 18:04.589
I think we need to keep our focus
on the provision itself.

18:04.673 --> 18:05.966
All right.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.010
The head of the African bloc
is Zimbabwe.

18:08.093 --> 18:12.639
And we believe Israel has promised them
a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.

18:12.723 --> 18:16.018
The Secretary and I recommend increasing
our relief funds to Zimbabwe.

18:16.101 --> 18:17.477
Outspend the Israelis.

18:17.561 --> 18:19.604
Well, President Chimbetu
will just pocket the money.

18:19.688 --> 18:22.274
Well, we always anticipate
a certain level of graft.

18:22.357 --> 18:25.527
A certain level? He's egregious.
The man's a monster.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.238
Who happens to run the African bloc.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.656
Who happens to kill his people
when he's not stealing from them,

18:29.740 --> 18:31.491
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.

18:31.575 --> 18:35.037
If we want him to remove the amendment,
we have to be persuasive.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.497
We are scraping together
every penny we can to save AmWorks.

18:37.581 --> 18:41.043
The last thing I want is to be slammed
for giving additional money

18:41.126 --> 18:45.839
to a brutal dictator from USAID just
to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.

18:45.923 --> 18:48.466
You should think before you bring
a proposal such as this.

18:48.550 --> 18:51.511
We'll pursue other strategies
and get back to you, Mr. President.

18:51.595 --> 18:53.889
Thank you. Robert,
what's the latest on the omnibus?

18:53.972 --> 18:56.725
The legislation should go to
the floor in the next couple of months.

18:56.808 --> 18:57.976
The leadership is pushing...

19:19.331 --> 19:21.625
Set up calls with both
Lockheed and Northrop.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.377
We'll pay people to get trained
and call it a job.

19:24.461 --> 19:26.338
It isn't a job
unless the union says it is.

19:26.421 --> 19:30.008
Well, one step at a time. You set up
the training and I'll speak to the AFL.

19:30.092 --> 19:31.384
Are the AARP here?

19:31.468 --> 19:34.429
In the lobby. The chairman told me
they want to support Dunbar.

19:34.512 --> 19:35.847
They're just trying to rattle us.

19:35.931 --> 19:37.891
Dunbar is promising
to save Social Security.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.769
Go after Wall Street and government
waste instead of entitlements.

19:40.852 --> 19:41.853
Well, get them in here.

19:41.937 --> 19:44.815
You have your call list. Their meeting's
not for another ten minutes.

19:44.898 --> 19:48.110
Start bringing them over. It'll take them
that long to hobble over on their walkers.

19:48.193 --> 19:50.487
- Francis?
- I'll go get them.

19:50.570 --> 19:52.197
I only have a few minutes.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.582
You singled me out today on purpose.

20:02.666 --> 20:05.085
- What?
- The cabinet meeting.

20:05.169 --> 20:07.045
If I'm gonna invite you
to cabinet meetings,

20:07.129 --> 20:09.006
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.

20:09.089 --> 20:10.799
Don't make it sound like a favor.

20:10.882 --> 20:12.717
You wanted to be there. I agreed.

20:12.801 --> 20:15.220
Well, so I could be informed
and do my job.

20:15.304 --> 20:18.223
Everyone in that room is judged
by what they bring to the table.

20:18.307 --> 20:20.642
What you brought to the table
was amateurish.

20:21.643 --> 20:23.395
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.357
I fault her as much as you.
You're making this too personal.

20:26.439 --> 20:30.277
It is personal. I think you're
punishing me for what happened in Russia.

20:30.361 --> 20:31.903
Oh, come on.

20:31.987 --> 20:35.032
Well, you said it on the plane.
Appointing me was a mistake.

20:35.115 --> 20:37.034
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.

20:37.117 --> 20:40.204
Yes, and I've gone out of my way
to put that fight behind us.

20:40.287 --> 20:42.206
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?

20:42.289 --> 20:44.124
When you screamed at us
for waking you up.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.335
- I didn't scream.
- It was embarrassing.

20:46.418 --> 20:47.794
Who cares what he thinks?

20:47.878 --> 20:50.047
He was our guest
and you walked in there like...

20:50.130 --> 20:52.257
I think you're searching for things
that aren't there

20:52.341 --> 20:55.344
and ignoring the things that are,
like this photograph flinching nonsense.

20:55.427 --> 20:57.012
Oh, Jesus.

20:59.223 --> 21:02.226
- Do you want me to resign, Francis?
- Don't be ridiculous.

21:02.309 --> 21:04.644
Just say it.

21:04.728 --> 21:06.897
You never wanted me to be ambassador.

21:06.980 --> 21:08.857
You remember what you
said to me on the plane?

21:08.940 --> 21:10.775
You should have never made me president.

21:10.859 --> 21:12.485
I was upset. I didn't mean it.

21:12.569 --> 21:14.738
You did mean it.
You think you made me.

21:14.821 --> 21:17.532
No, I don't.
I think we're a team, actually.

21:17.615 --> 21:19.617
Well, we're not a team at the moment.

21:24.706 --> 21:26.624
I can't believe we've become this.

21:28.085 --> 21:29.753
- Become what?
- Like everyone else.

21:34.425 --> 21:35.426
You ready, sir?

21:35.508 --> 21:37.635
No, just give me a minute.
Let the smoke clear.

22:03.036 --> 22:04.537
Where are we at?

22:33.858 --> 22:35.568
Her hair's different.

22:36.653 --> 22:38.196
But I...

22:39.448 --> 22:41.533
- Where was this taken?
- Santa Fe.

22:41.616 --> 22:43.743
I've narrowed the search
to focus just on that city.

22:43.827 --> 22:46.371
This is all I have,
but I think it's a good start.

22:47.580 --> 22:50.667
- I should go there.
- No. These photos are three weeks old.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.920
- She might have been passing through.
- Or she might still be there.

22:54.004 --> 22:57.299
Okay, but if you start asking questions,
you might tip her off.

22:57.382 --> 22:59.384
Get me more, then.

23:01.678 --> 23:03.305
How's my passport coming?

23:05.307 --> 23:08.352
I'll get the lock lifted
when you find her.

23:08.435 --> 23:11.188
I've shown you some progress.

23:11.271 --> 23:13.940
I think I should be seeing
progress on your side, too.

23:14.024 --> 23:14.983
This isn't enough.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.068
They just arrested
another one of my friends.

23:17.152 --> 23:19.612
- They could charge me at any minute.
- Gavin...

23:19.696 --> 23:23.033
The things that I've had to do
to get this much are fucked up.

23:23.116 --> 23:25.452
An exact location.

23:26.370 --> 23:27.538
That was our deal.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.795
Can you get me the camera feed?

23:35.879 --> 23:37.381
The system's monitoring it.

23:37.464 --> 23:39.132
I want it, too.

23:43.761 --> 23:45.263
I'll send you the link.

24:19.381 --> 24:21.299
Doug? This is Maurice.

24:21.383 --> 24:24.177
He'll be taking over for me.
I'm moving to Seattle.

24:24.261 --> 24:28.181
My sister's opening up her own PT center
and she wants me to be a partner.

24:28.265 --> 24:31.684
I'm moving all my clients
over to new folks.

24:31.768 --> 24:34.563
So I can help the transition.

24:34.646 --> 24:36.898
I'll be sad to see you go.

24:38.650 --> 24:40.527
I'll go get some bar floats.

24:40.611 --> 24:42.195
Back in a second.

24:44.281 --> 24:48.285
Look... I'm having people over
this Thursday.

24:48.368 --> 24:51.622
It's a going-away thing at my place.
You should come.

24:51.704 --> 24:53.957
- You ready?
- Yeah.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.000
I'll text you the details.

25:05.093 --> 25:08.221
I want to go after the big boys.
Not just Wall Street, but Walmart.

25:08.305 --> 25:11.433
I'd be careful with Walmart.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.

25:11.516 --> 25:15.186
Let's force them to take sides.
That means Jackie Sharp, too.

25:15.270 --> 25:16.688
Introduce legislation.

25:16.771 --> 25:19.065
She either votes for it
or we hit her hard.

25:19.149 --> 25:22.402
Any corporation who has more than ten
percent of its employees on food stamps

25:22.486 --> 25:25.947
has to increase wages
until they're below ten percent.

25:27.491 --> 25:29.784
Who has the guts
to sponsor something like that?

25:39.794 --> 25:41.171
Doug?

25:42.589 --> 25:45.629
Yeah, I'll put a list together. You'll
have something by the end of the week.

25:45.634 --> 25:46.801
Okay. Talk to you then.

26:18.583 --> 26:21.628
- You made it.
- Yeah.

26:23.004 --> 26:25.382
- How long have you been here?
- Ten minutes.

26:25.465 --> 26:28.134
Come on.
We need to get people dancing.

26:28.218 --> 26:30.303
Actually, I was thinking
that I should go.

26:30.387 --> 26:32.889
I just came over to say goodbye.

26:32.972 --> 26:36.518
Uh-uh. No. You are not going anywhere.

26:36.601 --> 26:41.439
You don't have to dance,
but you can't leave.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.415
Last man standing.

27:01.125 --> 27:03.878
- You have recycling?
- Just leave 'em on the counter.

27:03.961 --> 27:06.005
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

27:11.094 --> 27:12.679
You really don't have to help.

27:12.763 --> 27:14.305
I don't mind.

27:16.891 --> 27:19.018
You're such a gentleman.

27:19.102 --> 27:21.145
I don't know about that.

27:21.229 --> 27:23.440
Oh, you're not a gentleman?

27:24.441 --> 27:27.819
Because... that could be interesting.

28:06.608 --> 28:09.486
I made you a café au lait.

28:09.569 --> 28:11.446
Oh...

28:19.287 --> 28:20.789
How is it?

28:20.872 --> 28:22.833
- Need sugar?
- No.

28:22.915 --> 28:24.501
It's perfect.

28:26.711 --> 28:28.004
When are the movers coming by?

28:28.087 --> 28:31.132
Not for a couple hours.

28:31.215 --> 28:34.594
You need any help?
Packing the rest up?

28:34.678 --> 28:36.680
No. You just relax.

28:40.684 --> 28:43.227
You seemed a little sad last night.

28:44.521 --> 28:46.815
No, just tired.

28:46.898 --> 28:50.067
Was that it?
You were just tired?

28:55.532 --> 28:57.950
Someone I haven't heard from
in a long time.

28:59.410 --> 29:01.120
She reached out. It was...

29:01.204 --> 29:02.873
It was a little hard.

29:05.458 --> 29:08.378
Last night wasn't 'cause
you felt sorry for me, was it?

29:08.461 --> 29:10.505
No.

29:10.588 --> 29:14.592
Last night was because
I'm getting on a plane today,

29:14.676 --> 29:17.512
and I'll probably never see you again.

29:17.595 --> 29:19.347
Why not?

29:30.107 --> 29:32.360
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?

30:04.225 --> 30:06.895
Are you gonna come with me
to the memorial today?

30:08.104 --> 30:09.480
Do I need to be there?

30:09.564 --> 30:10.982
No.

30:13.651 --> 30:15.987
I'm buried right now.

30:16.070 --> 30:17.530
Fine.

30:54.692 --> 30:57.487
Why has Tom Yates been
hanging around so much?

30:57.570 --> 30:59.280
Is he writing a book on the president?

30:59.363 --> 31:01.658
We've all asked him and he won't say.

31:01.741 --> 31:03.785
Ballsy move if it's true.

31:03.868 --> 31:06.287
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.

31:07.497 --> 31:08.915
Are you an idiot?

31:08.999 --> 31:10.834
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?

31:10.917 --> 31:13.461
There's no opinions to be had.
His writing is gorgeous.

31:13.544 --> 31:15.797
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.841
Said the guy who can't write
a grocery list.

31:17.924 --> 31:20.551
- Shh, shh...
- Ready whenever you are, sir.

31:24.138 --> 31:27.892
Today marks the 80th Anniversary
of the Social Security Act.

31:27.976 --> 31:31.855
It has survived longer
than many of its beneficiaries.

31:31.938 --> 31:35.733
We should all be so lucky
to live as long as it has.

31:35.817 --> 31:40.237
But by the time the human body
has circled the sun 80 times,

31:40.321 --> 31:42.824
its youth and vigor are gone.

31:42.907 --> 31:46.118
Joints ache,
bones and muscles are weaker,

31:46.202 --> 31:49.914
the heart doesn't beat
with the same power it once did.

31:49.998 --> 31:53.043
All of us must face this truth eventually.

31:53.125 --> 31:56.295
And when we do,
we must hand the baton to the young.

31:56.379 --> 32:01.258
To those who have the strength
to carry on our work when we are gone.

32:01.342 --> 32:05.847
Here's another truth:
Social Security is dying.

32:05.930 --> 32:08.265
Now in its 80th year, it must give way

32:08.349 --> 32:12.436
to a new, younger,
stronger plan for the future.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.106
That plan is America Works.

32:15.189 --> 32:18.860
In Washington DC alone,
we've managed to reduce unemployment

32:18.943 --> 32:23.781
by over a third
and put 25,000 people to work.

32:23.865 --> 32:28.119
If we can accomplish so much
in so little time here in Washington,

32:28.202 --> 32:32.623
imagine what we could accomplish if
Congress funded America Works nationwide.

32:32.707 --> 32:35.085
We wouldn't be talking
about thousands of jobs.

32:35.167 --> 32:38.546
We'd be talking about millions.

32:38.629 --> 32:43.509
Later this afternoon, I will visit FDR's
memorial to pay my respects to the man

32:43.593 --> 32:47.221
who ushered in Social Security
80 years ago.

32:47.304 --> 32:51.017
We honor the dead for giving us
the world we inherited.

32:51.101 --> 32:57.648
However, we must recognize we are doomed
if we allow the dead to govern us.

32:57.732 --> 33:02.278
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.

33:02.361 --> 33:05.031
From NBC News in Washington,

33:05.115 --> 33:08.325
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

33:08.409 --> 33:10.703
Good morning and welcome
to Meet the Press.

33:10.787 --> 33:13.748
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley
and Congressman Greer.

33:13.831 --> 33:17.085
Congresswoman, let me start with you.
In the President's radio address today,

33:17.168 --> 33:21.422
he said the model here in Washington
is a model for the nation.

33:21.505 --> 33:23.507
- Do you agree?
- I do, Chuck.

33:23.591 --> 33:25.551
I was skeptical at first.

33:25.635 --> 33:28.012
Both my parents benefited
from Social Security.

33:28.096 --> 33:30.681
And I've always
counted on it for myself.

33:30.765 --> 33:34.102
But, when I think about my kids,
and my grandkids...

33:34.185 --> 33:36.353
Rebecca raises a good point,
one that we've been making

33:36.437 --> 33:37.981
in the Republican Party for decades.

33:38.064 --> 33:40.357
And yet, while you support America Works,

33:40.441 --> 33:42.568
most members of your party do not.

33:42.652 --> 33:44.988
Chuck, I've never been
a big fan of Frank Underwood.

33:45.071 --> 33:49.033
But the park near my house here
in Washington has never been cleaner.

33:49.117 --> 33:52.286
The dry cleaners I go to just hired
two new people this month.

33:52.369 --> 33:55.414
The daycare I drop my kids off at
doubled their staff

33:55.498 --> 33:57.834
so the children can get
more individual attention.

33:57.917 --> 34:01.045
The president may have overstepped
in taking FEMA money,

34:01.129 --> 34:05.091
but when something works, it works.
And America Works works.

35:10.907 --> 35:12.742
Hello.

37:19.118 --> 37:21.453
Promise the money.

37:21.537 --> 37:25.833
Whatever you need to turn him around.
I'll approve the USAID funds.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.213
What made you change your mind?

37:32.756 --> 37:36.219
Today... at the memorial.

37:38.262 --> 37:41.140
You know what struck me the most?

37:44.310 --> 37:46.103
Eleanor.

37:47.897 --> 37:50.274
She was off by herself.

37:50.358 --> 37:52.151
Alone.

37:53.527 --> 37:56.155
And so was Franklin. He was alone.

37:59.242 --> 38:01.827
And there was a wall between them.

38:05.956 --> 38:07.791
The monks.

38:07.875 --> 38:11.254
They've been here for weeks.
We haven't even discussed them once.

38:12.922 --> 38:14.882
It's beautiful, isn't it?
What they're doing?

38:14.965 --> 38:16.508
It is.

38:21.638 --> 38:24.516
Francis, I watched them
for over an hour today.

38:24.600 --> 38:28.854
And all I was thinking was, why aren't
you and I sharing this together?

38:38.906 --> 38:41.117
We have to do something, Claire.

38:43.244 --> 38:44.745
I know.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.167
What are you thinking?

38:50.251 --> 38:53.921
My natural color.
Like when I first met Francis.

38:54.755 --> 38:57.800
- This color?
- Yes. Exactly.

38:57.883 --> 38:59.427
Okay. Have a seat.

39:18.488 --> 39:20.072
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.

39:20.156 --> 39:22.616
Oh, I think they're perfect.
Thank you.

39:27.788 --> 39:30.500
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

39:52.813 --> 39:57.234
We have gathered today to renew
the vows between Francis J. Underwood

39:57.318 --> 40:00.821
and Claire Hale Underwood.

40:04.867 --> 40:07.286
It was here, in this church,

40:07.370 --> 40:10.956
28 years ago, before God,

40:11.040 --> 40:14.418
that you two first committed
yourselves to one another.

40:21.133 --> 40:24.554
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other,

40:24.636 --> 40:27.139
and strengthen your eternal bond.

41:09.473 --> 41:12.268
Claire's father bought us this house.

41:12.351 --> 41:15.854
I wanted to pay for it myself.
That's always bothered me.

41:15.938 --> 41:18.774
You weren't bothered to let him pay
for your first campaign?

41:18.857 --> 41:22.778
Well, that's politics. It's different.
You take money wherever you can get it.

41:22.861 --> 41:25.030
No, this was our first home.

41:26.073 --> 41:28.700
- Was it a happy home?
- Oh, please.

41:30.536 --> 41:33.456
I thought you brought me here because
we were gonna cut through the bullshit.

41:33.539 --> 41:35.458
This book is supposed to be
about America Works.

41:35.541 --> 41:37.834
There is no book
without you at the center of it.

41:39.462 --> 41:41.838
Do you trust me? Or don't you?

41:41.922 --> 41:43.966
Because if you don't,
get someone else to write it.

41:44.049 --> 41:45.050
Or write it yourself.

41:45.134 --> 41:48.512
You don't know what it's like to go
through life looking over your shoulder.

41:48.596 --> 41:50.931
Having secrets no one would understand.

41:51.014 --> 41:52.891
I didn't write my first book.

41:54.726 --> 41:56.312
My friend.

41:58.063 --> 42:01.442
- The one who died.
- He wrote it?

42:01.525 --> 42:04.320
The first half.
He didn't show it to anyone except me.

42:04.403 --> 42:06.822
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.

42:06.905 --> 42:08.699
I told him I would.

42:12.119 --> 42:14.121
It was too good.

42:14.204 --> 42:16.415
It needed to be finished.
So I finished it.

42:16.499 --> 42:21.295
- And took all the credit.
- Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.

42:21.378 --> 42:22.921
That's what people remember.

42:24.131 --> 42:25.882
But the book...

42:27.884 --> 42:29.553
My entire career...

42:31.930 --> 42:33.516
It's all based on a lie.

42:33.599 --> 42:36.352
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.783
There's tulips buried under here.

42:53.619 --> 42:55.538
Claire planted them.

42:59.958 --> 43:01.711
I've always...

43:04.087 --> 43:05.964
from day one...

43:08.384 --> 43:11.345
been ashamed she said yes
when I asked her to marry me.

43:11.428 --> 43:13.013
Why?

43:15.391 --> 43:17.434
I didn't think I deserved her.

43:20.229 --> 43:23.691
I can tell you this, though, there would
have been no White House without Claire.

43:23.774 --> 43:26.318
I was half the man before I met her.

43:26.402 --> 43:29.029
But still, I've been selfish...

43:30.573 --> 43:32.908
feeding off her the way I have.

43:32.991 --> 43:34.951
She knew what she was getting into.

43:36.203 --> 43:40.832
Probably. She knows me
better than I know myself.

43:41.751 --> 43:44.461
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at 6:15.

43:44.545 --> 43:46.505
Should probably leave
in the next few minutes.

43:46.589 --> 43:48.507
Thank you, Meechum.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.971
Scribble away.

44:04.690 --> 44:07.859
So, what'd he tell you
in front of the house?

44:07.943 --> 44:09.528
Mm...

44:09.612 --> 44:11.154
Nothing much.

44:11.238 --> 44:13.240
Well, it looked intense,
whatever it was.

44:13.323 --> 44:17.411
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.

44:17.494 --> 44:19.413
You did this time.

44:22.165 --> 44:24.376
Sometimes you just need
to leave someone alone.

44:24.460 --> 44:27.630
All right, I got the hint.

44:27.713 --> 44:31.675
I meant him. Not me.

44:57.701 --> 44:59.578
Where are they?

44:59.662 --> 45:02.456
- Who?
- The monks.

45:02.539 --> 45:04.958
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.

45:05.917 --> 45:07.670
So it's gone?

45:07.753 --> 45:10.046
I believe so.

45:10.130 --> 45:12.257
I didn't get a chance to see it.

45:12.341 --> 45:14.176
I'm sure they took a photo.

45:16.261 --> 45:18.848
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?

45:18.930 --> 45:20.932
Right away, sir.

46:23.871 --> 46:25.288
Thank you.

46:30.419 --> 46:33.338
Claire.
I almost didn't recognize you.

46:33.422 --> 46:36.049
Yes,
I decided it was time for a change.

46:36.132 --> 46:37.968
It's very fetching.

46:38.051 --> 46:40.178
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

46:40.262 --> 46:43.432
Oh, of course not.
My staff said you'd be out of town.

46:43.515 --> 46:47.185
Would you mind if I borrowed
Ambassador Caspi for a moment?

46:47.269 --> 46:48.270
Of course.

46:51.231 --> 46:54.777
- You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
- I had a trip to Jerusalem.

46:56.445 --> 46:58.488
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million

46:58.572 --> 47:01.283
so they'd introduce
the poison pill amendment.

47:01.366 --> 47:03.660
- For purely humanitarian reasons.
- No.

47:03.744 --> 47:07.456
This is the first time
you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.

47:07.539 --> 47:10.208
Don't draw connections that don't exist.

47:10.292 --> 47:13.670
We would never try
to sabotage the resolution.

47:13.754 --> 47:17.507
- The United States is our ally.
- That's right, we are.

47:17.591 --> 47:21.177
- So act like it.
- Excuse me?

47:21.261 --> 47:25.557
My husband formally approved our own
humanitarian package for eighty million.

47:25.641 --> 47:30.270
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing
the amendment tomorrow.

47:30.353 --> 47:32.439
And when the resolution goes to a vote,

47:32.522 --> 47:35.943
I expect Israel to support it
like the loyal ally she is.

47:36.026 --> 47:37.987
Not lie to us.

47:38.069 --> 47:40.322
That's not the way to solicit our support.

47:40.405 --> 47:43.742
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.

47:43.826 --> 47:46.495
I feel sorry for you, Claire.

47:46.578 --> 47:49.748
Your husband sends you to talk tough.

47:49.832 --> 47:52.668
But as soon as things go wrong
in the Jordan Valley,

47:52.751 --> 47:55.587
he'll turn his back and leave Israel
to clean up the mess.

47:55.671 --> 47:57.130
He doesn't have the muscle.

47:57.213 --> 47:59.299
He can't even get Congress
to work with him.

47:59.382 --> 48:01.593
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.

48:01.677 --> 48:04.722
He turned his back on you
just like he will on us.

48:07.098 --> 48:11.269
My husband is the bravest
and most resolute man I know.

48:11.353 --> 48:12.771
He will succeed in this plan.

48:12.855 --> 48:14.564
Brave?

48:14.648 --> 48:16.483
I served in Jordan Valley.

48:16.566 --> 48:19.194
As did the President
and the Foreign Minister. Has he?

48:20.779 --> 48:24.616
You held a gun and somebody
told you where to stand.

48:24.700 --> 48:29.538
Don't confuse that with the burden
the Commander in Chief faces.

48:29.621 --> 48:31.289
Francis has given the order to kill.

48:31.373 --> 48:33.834
He's buried soldiers
he's put into harm's way.

48:33.917 --> 48:36.753
And every day,
he wakes up bearing responsibilities

48:36.837 --> 48:38.922
you can't possibly imagine.

48:39.006 --> 48:41.591
They would crush you
if they fell on your shoulders.

48:41.675 --> 48:43.760
So you talk to your superiors.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.347
And when the amendment
is withdrawn tomorrow,

48:47.430 --> 48:51.267
you will commit
to supporting the resolution.

49:34.978 --> 49:36.312
Oh...
