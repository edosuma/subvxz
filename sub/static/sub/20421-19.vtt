00:07.120 --> 00:08.830
Yum!

00:09.190 --> 00:11.700
Delicious! So juicy...

00:16.460 --> 00:18.560
No sign of the goblins...

00:18.990 --> 00:21.140
Maybe they aren't coming?

00:21.140 --> 00:23.960
We can't lower our guard, Marie.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.230
Crusty's forward strike force has 
reached Narashino, right?

00:28.700 --> 00:32.380
They're heading toward the main goblin battalion.

00:32.940 --> 00:36.460
Their fight might decide our fate here.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.310
Serara...

00:40.960 --> 00:42.280
I have a favor to ask.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.610
It's starting.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.460
Direct strike to the enemy vanguard's center.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.680

03:36.610 --> 03:38.780
Reinforcements. Two hill giants.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.150
Healers should flank both sides.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.630
Start by annihilating the smaller side groups.

03:43.630 --> 03:45.660
Main force, continue to advance.

Roger. Departing.

04:30.030 --> 04:30.770

04:30.770 --> 04:32.680
Maintain position until further orders.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.680
Come in.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.220
This is Narashino.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.790
As planned, we've rendezvoused.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.020
Understood. Location confirmed.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.110
The Ocypete has met up with 
the second Akihabara group.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.110
Roger.

04:40.110 --> 04:40.910
Come in.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.030
Please confirm location.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.300
Once they complete some maintenance, 
they'll set out for Choushi.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.300
Understood.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.810
Seems the telepathy communication 
network is working.

04:49.560 --> 04:53.620
Each squad has a leader, and squads 
can communicate with one another.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.820
And they have a contact at headquarters 
with whom they can speak, as well.

04:59.250 --> 05:03.490
This supports smooth communication among squads.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.820
Crusty and his force are kicking butt, too.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.780
Looks like it's going well, right?

05:08.460 --> 05:10.160
Choushi is the problem.

05:10.430 --> 05:12.060
What's the issue?

05:12.470 --> 05:14.920
Victory isn't going to be overly hard.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.280
But after the battle ends,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.710
the goblins will flee in all directions.

05:20.410 --> 05:23.030
They might attack the People of the Land's villages.

05:24.010 --> 05:28.370
To prevent this, we've been surrounding 
the goblins as we attack,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.020
leading them to a single point.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.910
But we must also protect the town of Choushi...

05:37.240 --> 05:39.250
Or our encirclement will be broken.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.910
The town of Choushi is the most 
critical point in this plan.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.490
I get it...

05:48.950 --> 05:50.290
My lord...

05:50.800 --> 05:53.200
You aren't going to the battle?

05:53.530 --> 05:54.750
I want to go...

05:55.080 --> 05:58.390
But until all platoons have 
deployed, I can't move.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.450
I see...

06:10.590 --> 06:12.400
Are you really all right?

06:13.550 --> 06:14.440
With what?

06:15.280 --> 06:16.800
"With what"?

06:17.430 --> 06:21.690
Of course, I, Rundel Haus Code, 
am in perfect shape!

06:21.980 --> 06:24.560
I feel like no one in the world can stop me.

06:28.010 --> 06:30.370
Good, all clear!

06:30.370 --> 06:33.330
I hope it will stay that way.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.380
Don't worry.

06:35.380 --> 06:38.250
If we all work together, the goblins are nothing.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.460
What's wrong?

06:40.750 --> 06:42.810
What is that?

06:53.470 --> 06:56.090
That's more than a few hundred.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.600
A thousand, I'd imagine.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.860
If that many rush into the town together...

07:03.010 --> 07:06.790
<i>I can't let the kids do anything reckless again.</i>

07:07.360 --> 07:08.420
<i>But...</i>

07:09.560 --> 07:10.810
Marielle!

07:12.030 --> 07:13.790
Let's hit them first!

07:13.790 --> 07:16.910
Yes, let's destroy them before 
they can reach the town!

07:18.090 --> 07:20.410
Nyanta, let us go!

07:21.260 --> 07:22.170
Meow.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.170
Marie!

07:27.880 --> 07:30.430
Give us the order to fire everyone up!

07:33.920 --> 07:37.550
Everyone, thank you for all you've done.

07:37.900 --> 07:40.810
Help us out just a bit more... 
Just one more fight.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.200
I believe in all of you!

07:44.720 --> 07:45.570
Let's go!

07:46.040 --> 07:47.320
Forward!

07:49.130 --> 07:52.820
Everyone, let's split into teams, 
to be ready for a second wave.

07:53.270 --> 07:57.450
Tohya, our party will focus on support.

07:57.450 --> 07:58.880
Okay, got it!

07:59.260 --> 08:00.620
Leave it to me!

08:00.960 --> 08:01.830
Shiroe!

08:02.560 --> 08:06.350
The camp group, in Choushi, has just 
made contact with the sahuagin.

08:06.790 --> 08:11.230
There are sixty adventurers and 
at least a thousand sahuagin.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.360
They're overwhelmed!

08:14.010 --> 08:15.720
Tell the Ocypete to hurry!

08:18.100 --> 08:21.230
<b>135 km Remaining to Meinion Coast 
(Half Gaia distance)</b>

08:38.170 --> 08:39.430
Wait.

08:40.370 --> 08:44.910
Right now, our job is to recover our MP.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.000
Naotsugu, here.

08:49.370 --> 08:50.330
Thanks.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.350
<i>Whirlwind Slash!</i>

09:00.010 --> 09:02.760
Tohya has grown stronger.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.480
Yeah. He still has a ways to go...

09:07.540 --> 09:09.730
But he'll get stronger.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.640
Same goes for Serara.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.990
She used to only think about healing...

09:16.270 --> 09:18.410
<i>Please, Wolfy!</i>

09:24.880 --> 09:29.730
But now she's using offensive techniques, 
and remembering to summon her companion.

09:30.130 --> 09:34.470
Also, the bard girl and the sorcerer boy...

09:37.040 --> 09:39.180
<i>Dance of Pavane!</i>

09:39.570 --> 09:44.560
They back each other up as if they can 
understand each other's thoughts.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.850
<i>Burned Strike!</i>

09:49.720 --> 09:52.650
Rundel Haus is a walking bundle of vigor.

09:53.140 --> 09:56.360
He's putting all his feeling and 
emotion into his magic.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.220
And...

09:57.220 --> 10:00.120
Rudy, try to keep your output down.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.240
Roger.

10:01.240 --> 10:01.950
Serara!

10:02.260 --> 10:03.680
We're good on healing.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.620
Go back on attack!

10:05.620 --> 10:06.970
All right!

10:07.580 --> 10:10.340
<b>Guardian Barrier</b>

10:08.100 --> 10:10.340
Eight seconds until Guardian Barrier!

10:11.340 --> 10:14.340
Minori keeps a constant eye on 
the big picture as she fights.

10:14.790 --> 10:16.320
Her friends' teamwork,

10:16.320 --> 10:17.510
enemy location,

10:17.940 --> 10:19.100
enemy encounter order,

10:19.100 --> 10:20.520
enemy defeat order...

10:20.900 --> 10:23.830
Like writing each enemy defeat as a sentence,

10:23.830 --> 10:26.190
each battle as a chapter,

10:26.190 --> 10:31.200
and collecting all those chapters 
into a book called <i>Tactics</i>.

10:32.030 --> 10:35.520
The way she's fighting is just like Shiro.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.410
To the percent, and in thirty-second increments,

10:40.800 --> 10:41.830
I suppose...

10:43.080 --> 10:47.480
I think he meant that he was fighting by 
looking thirty seconds into the future.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.580
One percent is how closely he 
tracks his allies' remaining MP.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.300
Tracking the MP of allies in different classes

10:55.300 --> 10:58.840
is impossible without monitoring the status screen.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.370
But he can track it to a percent,

11:02.490 --> 11:04.870

will be in thirty seconds.

11:09.540 --> 11:12.390
He makes everything proceed 
the way he wants it to.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.730
That's Shiro's fully controlled combat...

11:16.660 --> 11:18.430
The full-control encounter.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.420
Tohya, move back a bit!

11:21.940 --> 11:24.740
Serara, group heal, please!

11:25.020 --> 11:26.240
Roger!

11:27.180 --> 11:29.500
Of course, we actually live in this world now...

11:30.360 --> 11:34.030
So I doubt he can see a full thirty 
seconds ahead, as he once could.

11:34.530 --> 11:39.000
But what Minori's attempting is, 
without doubt, an imitation

11:39.410 --> 11:41.690
of Shiro's full-control encounter.

11:42.420 --> 11:46.230
Minori is chasing after Shiroe.

11:46.950 --> 11:50.250
Who knows how many seconds 
ahead she can see?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.250
That sound...

11:56.530 --> 12:01.140
It's the druid's special attack 
magic, Shrieker Echo.

12:02.950 --> 12:06.550
I had Serara set it up as a warning system!

12:06.980 --> 12:08.930
I'm sure the goblins are returning!

12:08.930 --> 12:10.790
We'll go, master!

12:11.000 --> 12:12.010
Again?

12:12.010 --> 12:13.500
Wait, Rudy!

12:13.500 --> 12:16.540
U-Um, you do your best, too, Nyanta!

12:16.740 --> 12:18.220
Hey, you guys!

12:18.220 --> 12:19.220
Naotsugu...

12:19.810 --> 12:22.940
We can handle the goblins.

12:22.940 --> 12:27.100
Isuzu the bard is with us, 
so we have good sustain.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.030
We'll go!

12:29.690 --> 12:30.640
H-Hey!

12:31.370 --> 12:32.510
Minori!

12:39.490 --> 12:41.390
I'll be the operator.

12:41.390 --> 12:44.240
Serara, focus on healing.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.410
But you're the field monitor, Minori...

12:47.770 --> 12:51.050
I'll handle keeping up everyone's MP.

12:51.050 --> 12:52.250
Goblins!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.700
<i>There are a lot.</i>

13:00.700 --> 13:02.380
<i>We need to get them all together.</i>

13:02.380 --> 13:05.440
<i>But the samurai skills aren't fast enough.</i>

13:05.440 --> 13:06.340
Rudy!

13:06.720 --> 13:08.120
Leave it to me!

13:08.120 --> 13:11.600
I shall show you the beautiful 
melody of my magic!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.900

13:50.160 --> 13:51.200
Same here!

13:51.640 --> 13:54.270
Miss Isuzu, did you see

13:54.590 --> 13:57.060
my lovely magic?

14:00.450 --> 14:02.950
I sure did. Good job.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.030
It sort of feels like you're making fun of me.

14:06.810 --> 14:08.260
Hmm, am I?

14:08.260 --> 14:09.670
Wh-What?

14:09.670 --> 14:10.380
Just kidding.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.670
I'm not making fun of you!

14:11.670 --> 14:12.370
Really?

14:12.370 --> 14:15.630
<i>I can only see five seconds ahead, 
in five-percent increments.</i>

14:15.630 --> 14:17.220
<i>If I'm lucky, maybe ten seconds.</i>

14:17.630 --> 14:20.540
<i>I can't do it as well as Shiroe yet...</i>

14:22.940 --> 14:24.820
That close to the town...

14:25.190 --> 14:25.970
Let's hurry!

14:30.680 --> 14:31.550

14:32.050 --> 14:35.230
The Ocypete will be there in an hour.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.240
Hang on until then.

14:37.890 --> 14:40.860
Everyone, reinforcements will arrive in an hour.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.110
Keep it up!

14:42.110 --> 14:43.470
Yeah!

14:54.840 --> 14:55.760

14:56.160 --> 14:57.100
I'm fine.

14:58.470 --> 14:59.980
<i>Rudy's MP is low.</i>

15:00.460 --> 15:02.550
<i>How long will this fight take?</i>

15:02.980 --> 15:04.300
Everyone...

15:04.750 --> 15:06.490
I have a message from Marielle.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.680
A ship carrying reinforcements will be here soon.

15:10.060 --> 15:13.250
When it comes, they'll be able 
to send some help our way.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.330
Really?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.560
Just a little more... Let's keep it up!

15:16.560 --> 15:18.960
Good... I was getting worried.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.810
I'm starving.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.520
<i>Rain?</i>

15:34.280 --> 15:35.790
<b>Dire Wolf, Lv. 32 
Rank/ Party</b>

15:36.140 --> 15:37.530
A dire wolf!

15:37.530 --> 15:39.790
And it isn't alone...

16:09.740 --> 16:11.150
<i>Willow Spirits!</i>

16:19.310 --> 16:22.170
<i>Emergency Spell: Prayer to the Four Quarters!</i>

16:26.880 --> 16:28.880
<b>Minori</b>

16:30.260 --> 16:31.990
Please stop!

16:31.990 --> 16:35.320
Serara, focus on the dire wolf.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.850
But then I can't heal.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.160
I'll handle the healing!

16:41.900 --> 16:44.320
<i>Two dire wolves and the hobgoblins...</i>

16:44.670 --> 16:46.640
<i>If they attack at once, Tohya won't...</i>

16:48.700 --> 16:49.850
Tohya,

16:49.850 --> 16:52.360
you take the hobgoblins 
and one of the wolves.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.520
Rudy! Isuzu!

16:54.820 --> 16:57.800
Prayer to the Four Quarters will 
last another thirty-two seconds.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.940
Before it runs out...

16:59.300 --> 17:00.170
Okay!

17:00.170 --> 17:01.000
Roger!

17:04.880 --> 17:09.380
When you encounter a difficult opponent, 
there are a number of different strategies.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.940
One example is to eliminate the weaker ones first.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.330
By lowering the number of potential attackers,

17:16.330 --> 17:18.980
you also limit the amount of damage they deal.

17:24.390 --> 17:26.100
<i>Frigid Wind!</i>

17:28.210 --> 17:29.980
<i>Resonance Beat!</i>

17:38.790 --> 17:39.740
Tohya!

17:47.060 --> 17:50.740
Miss Isuzu, we must eliminate 
that other dire wolf now!

17:50.740 --> 17:51.420
Yeah.

17:58.980 --> 17:59.990
No!

18:03.120 --> 18:05.060
The healing can't keep up!

18:05.480 --> 18:07.650
<i>Two dire wolves and the hobgoblins...</i>

18:08.050 --> 18:10.850
<i>If Tohya's HP keeps going down like this...</i>

18:13.380 --> 18:15.200
<i>In nine seconds, Tohya will...</i>

18:16.770 --> 18:19.960
<i>Eight seconds until I can cast 
Purification Barrier again.</i>

18:20.510 --> 18:25.460
<i>No, a barrier like that won't 
work against these opponents.</i>

18:35.150 --> 18:36.590
<i>If Tohya loses...</i>

18:38.100 --> 18:39.070
<i>If he loses...</i>

18:46.940 --> 18:47.790
Rudy!

18:48.030 --> 18:48.790
Rudy!

18:50.300 --> 18:51.230
Mister Tohya!

18:52.030 --> 18:54.350
Leave the doggies to me!

18:54.350 --> 18:55.380
That's crazy!

18:55.380 --> 18:56.320
Rudy, you're a...

18:56.320 --> 18:58.460
Don't worry, Miss Isuzu!

18:58.940 --> 19:01.990
I won't lose to these mutts!

19:07.730 --> 19:08.790
Rudy!

19:15.130 --> 19:17.700
Don't underestimate me... I am...

19:19.010 --> 19:21.950
I am Rundel Haus Code...

19:23.050 --> 19:25.180
An adventurer!

19:42.590 --> 19:43.550
Rudy!

19:43.850 --> 19:44.790
Rudy!

19:49.870 --> 19:51.300
If we don't do something...

19:51.300 --> 19:52.340
I'll do it.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.120
<i>Nature Revive!</i>

19:59.660 --> 20:01.670
The revival spell isn't working?

20:01.670 --> 20:02.570
Why?

20:03.040 --> 20:04.390
Minori, try another!

20:07.220 --> 20:08.780
<i>Soul-call Prayer!</i>

20:13.750 --> 20:15.340
It isn't working.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.810
Why not?!

20:21.130 --> 20:22.530
I'm sorry.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.570
Rudy... Rudy is...

20:27.700 --> 20:29.010
Rudy is...

20:30.200 --> 20:31.790
one of the People of the Land.

20:35.160 --> 20:41.610
He joined our party, 
adventured with us, ate with us...

20:42.070 --> 20:44.000
But Rudy is...

20:45.730 --> 20:48.180
Adding you now...

20:48.700 --> 20:49.680
Huh?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.070
Why?

20:55.610 --> 20:58.000
Are you one of the People of the Land?

21:05.320 --> 21:08.590
Would you keep it secret from 
the others, Miss Isuzu?

21:09.110 --> 21:10.010
But...

21:11.950 --> 21:14.750
I'm going to become an adventurer.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.630
That's why he worked so hard.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.720
Why he was so desperate...

21:35.560 --> 21:39.110
I couldn't tell him that he 
couldn't be an adventurer...

21:40.650 --> 21:43.030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

21:44.200 --> 21:46.900
No way... Rudy is one of 
the People of the Land?

21:46.900 --> 21:49.000
Then we can't revive him?

21:49.340 --> 21:52.120
Serara, try another revival spell!

21:52.570 --> 21:55.170
It's still on cool down.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.630
Maybe a healing spell?

22:10.360 --> 22:14.480
When I heal him, it feels like 
there's some small response...

22:18.190 --> 22:20.480
But I'm sorry.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.450
If reviving doesn't work...

22:24.220 --> 22:25.100
There's still hope!

22:26.290 --> 22:29.780
Help us, please... Shiroe!

22:31.700 --> 22:34.480
Shiroe, we need your help!

24:05.640 --> 24:07.420
Rundel Haus is dead.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.690
He is one of the People of the Land.

24:08.690 --> 24:10.800
The People of the Land cannot revive.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.780
That is the law of this world.

24:12.780 --> 24:14.350
But to grant Minori's wish,

24:14.780 --> 24:16.530
Shiroe challenges the laws...

24:17.100 --> 24:18.410
For a true friend,

24:18.410 --> 24:22.230
who would travel the world with you to 
find a dawn that no one has ever seen.

24:22.230 --> 24:29.990
<b>Contract</b>

24:22.490 --> 24:24.330
Next time: Contract.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.690
We will change the world.
