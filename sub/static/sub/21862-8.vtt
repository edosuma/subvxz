02:01.458 --> 02:05.291
<c.speaker>Absolutely not.
The Royal Guards
will track down Shuriki.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.875
<c.speaker>And Chief Zephyr has
Jaquin Scouts
out looking for her.

02:08.875 --> 02:12.958
<c.speaker>That's all great.
But, I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.458
<c.speaker>Nothing?
You will be ruling.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.875

05:34.458 --> 05:37.458

Fiero stole?

This is the last spell
in the book.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.625

were <i>blank. </i>

06:36.625 --> 06:39.416

<c.speaker>That's right. We got lucky.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.500
<c.speaker>And I've got more good news!

06:43.500 --> 06:45.875
<c.speaker>I finally figured out
how to shapeshift!

06:45.875 --> 06:47.333
<c.speaker>[gasps]
Into what?

06:47.333 --> 06:48.583

<c.speaker>[Elena chuckles]
Hey, can I try it?

07:00.875 --> 07:02.291
<c.speaker>Sprinkle away.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.083
<c.speaker>Whoa! Woo!

<c.speaker>-Four legs, four legs.
-Whoa-oa-oa! Whoa-oa!

07:15.750 --> 07:17.583
<c.speaker>I did that
the first time, too.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.625
<c.speaker>Wow!
You'd never know it was me!

07:22.625 --> 07:24.416
<c.speaker>I could fly right
out of the castle,

07:24.416 --> 07:26.625
<c.speaker>and nobody would think twice.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.166
<c.speaker>[gasps]
This is just what I needed!

07:29.166 --> 07:31.125
<c.speaker>Now I can go search for Shuriki.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.583
<c.speaker>I'll find Chief Zephyr
at Luna's party

07:33.583 --> 07:36.000
<c.speaker>and convince him to let me
join the search.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.166
<c.speaker>There is no way
Gabe's gonna let you
out of the palace.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.833
<c.speaker>He won't even know I'm going!

07:40.833 --> 07:43.625
<c.speaker>-Bye!
-[groans] Wait!

07:43.625 --> 07:45.375
<c.speaker>Elena, stop!

07:45.375 --> 07:48.708
<c.speaker>Mateo, I owe it to my parents
to find Shuriki.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.166
<c.speaker>You understand that, right?

07:50.166 --> 07:52.750
<c.speaker>I do. So, I'll go with you.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.291
<c.speaker>Thank you.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.583
<c.speaker>-Ooh! Oops.
-[Gabe] Elena!

07:56.583 --> 07:58.250
<c.speaker>Is everything o--
[gasps]

07:58.250 --> 08:00.000
<c.speaker>Who are you,
and how'd you get
in the castle?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.291
<c.speaker>Gabe! It's me, Elena!

08:02.291 --> 08:04.291
<c.speaker>Mateo made
a shapeshifting potion.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.333
<c.speaker>Ha! You expect me
to believe that?

08:09.708 --> 08:11.500
<c.speaker>[gasps]
It really is you!

08:11.500 --> 08:12.708
<c.speaker>-Told you.
-Ooh, my tail!

08:12.708 --> 08:15.000
<c.speaker>And now that I can
shapeshift like this,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.125
<c.speaker>I can go to the Mooncliff
for Luna's party.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.458
<c.speaker>Nice try.
But you can't go.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.250
<c.speaker>Remember the Council ruling?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.458
<c.speaker>Elena the Crown Princess
has to stay in the castle.

08:24.458 --> 08:28.166
<c.speaker>-Oh-ho-ho! Whoa!
-But the Council never said
anything about Elena the Jaquin.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.250
<c.speaker>You know what they meant.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.708
<c.speaker>Shuriki is out there.
It's too dangerous.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.333
<c.speaker>-[crashing sounds]
-But even if Shuriki saw me,

08:34.333 --> 08:35.291
<c.speaker>she wouldn't know it was me.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.291
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
Whoa-oa-oa!

08:36.291 --> 08:37.291
<c.speaker>You didn't.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.000
<c.speaker>-Come with us!
-[Mateo] Whoa! Whoa!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.833
<c.speaker>You can protect me
if anything goes wrong.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.250
<c.speaker>-Got it!
-[sighs]

08:43.250 --> 08:46.083
<c.speaker>Okay. But we go straight there
and straight back.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.083
<c.speaker>Deal?

08:47.083 --> 08:48.708
<c.speaker>Deal!

08:48.708 --> 08:50.750
<c.speaker>Now, let's shake
a tail feather!

08:50.750 --> 08:51.875
<c.speaker>Get it?
[laughs]

08:51.875 --> 08:53.833
<c.speaker>[groans]
Yeah, unfortunately.

08:53.833 --> 08:54.875
<c.speaker>Huh?

08:57.625 --> 08:59.208
<c.speaker>-[Elena] Whoo-hoo!
-[Mateo] This is amazing!

08:59.208 --> 09:00.958
<c.speaker>[both laughing and cheering]

09:00.958 --> 09:02.875
<c.speaker>All right. We have to keep
a tight formation.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.083
<c.speaker>Uh, Gabe. You're kind of
cramping my wingspan.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.416
<c.speaker>I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.458
<c.speaker>Even if you are a Jaquin.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.291
<c.speaker>[sighs]

09:10.291 --> 09:12.291
<c.speaker>Hey, Mateo!
Let's buzz the harbor.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.166
<c.speaker>Hey, wait up!

09:16.166 --> 09:19.458
<c.speaker>When we reach the Mooncliff,
I need you to distract Gabe.

09:19.458 --> 09:20.708
<c.speaker>I'll do my best.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.291
<c.speaker>[screams]
Boat!

09:22.291 --> 09:23.708
<c.speaker>Go sideways!

09:24.708 --> 09:26.708
<c.speaker>Sideways?
How do I-- Whoa!

09:27.708 --> 09:28.708
<c.speaker>Whoa!

09:28.708 --> 09:29.875
<c.speaker>Oh! Uhh!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.291
<c.speaker>[grunts]
Uhh.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.500
<c.speaker>Hey, saw your tumble.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.750
<c.speaker>Yeah, looks like you could use
a helping paw, <i>amiga. </i>

09:41.750 --> 09:43.458
<c.speaker>Uh, thanks.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
<c.speaker>[Gabe grunting]

09:44.625 --> 09:46.083
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
Whoo! Whoa! Whoa!

09:46.083 --> 09:48.708
<c.speaker>[Mateo and Gabe
grunting and panting]

09:48.708 --> 09:50.375
<c.speaker>[Both]
Unh!

09:50.375 --> 09:52.458
<c.speaker>You guys new to flying
or something?

09:52.458 --> 09:56.083
<c.speaker>Us? No! No!
We've been flying
our whole lives.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.708
<c.speaker>You know, 'cause...
we're Jaquins.

09:58.708 --> 10:01.875
<c.speaker>[chuckles]
Relax there, <i>amigo.  </i>
I was just teasing.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.333
<c.speaker>I am Cruz.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.583
<c.speaker>I'm... uh... um... Luisa.
[laughs nervously]

10:07.583 --> 10:10.000
<c.speaker>I... Francisco! Is my name.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.208
<c.speaker>And I'm... Esteban?

10:13.208 --> 10:15.833
<c.speaker>Like... the royal family?

10:15.833 --> 10:20.458
<c.speaker>[laughs]
Yeah, our parents are
big, big fans.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.125
<c.speaker>Um, hm, well,
we should get going.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.875
<c.speaker>We're-We're late for a party
at the Mooncliff.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.125
<c.speaker>You're going
to Luna's birthday bash?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.958
<c.speaker>Well, that's where
I'm headed, too!

10:27.958 --> 10:30.750
<c.speaker>Come on, then, friends.
Let's get flappin'.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.416
<c.speaker>[Elena]
There's Chief Zephyr.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.000
<c.speaker>Those must be his Scouts!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.875
<c.speaker>[cheering]

10:42.875 --> 10:45.083
<c.speaker>Ha-ha! Oh, nice pass!

10:45.083 --> 10:47.458
<c.speaker>-[Player] Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha!
-Here! Pass it to the
birthday girl!

10:50.708 --> 10:53.291
<c.speaker>-[All] Whoa!
-[Cruz] Oh, I see you've
still got some

10:53.291 --> 10:54.958
<c.speaker>swing in that wing, Luna!

10:54.958 --> 10:56.625
<c.speaker>Cruz! You made it!

10:56.625 --> 10:58.083
<c.speaker>Time out, guys.
Cruz is here.

10:58.083 --> 11:02.000
<c.speaker>Estrella, Zoom, Mingo--
let me introduce you to Cruz.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.833
<c.speaker>Chief Zephyr is training him
to be our next leader.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.166
<c.speaker>[All]
Whoa!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.250
<c.speaker>Are we talkin'
or are we playin'?

11:09.250 --> 11:11.166
<c.speaker>Come on, Cruz.
You're on my team.

11:11.166 --> 11:13.875
<c.speaker>All right!
You can't lose with Cruz!

11:13.875 --> 11:15.458
<c.speaker>Then we need a third player.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.083
<c.speaker>Take Francisco!
He's great at airball.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.625
<c.speaker>It's skyball.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.875
<c.speaker>What are you doing?
I don't know how to play!

11:20.875 --> 11:22.000
<c.speaker>I'm sure you'll pick it up.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.833
<c.speaker>Go on!
It looks like fun!

11:23.833 --> 11:26.583
<c.speaker>Fine. One game,
and then we leave.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.250
<c.speaker>All right, I'm gonna go
talk to Chief Zephyr.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
<c.speaker>Hello, Chief Zephyr.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.875
<c.speaker>Uh, sir.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.958
<c.speaker>I'm here to join the search
for Shuriki. Sir.

11:39.958 --> 11:44.000
<c.speaker>Thank you, but only my Scouts
are trained for
that kind of mission.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
<c.speaker>-But I--
-Now, if you will excuse me.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.166
<c.speaker>[cheering]

11:50.166 --> 11:51.375
<c.speaker>Heads up!

11:52.833 --> 11:54.000
<c.speaker>[grunts]
Yeah!

11:54.000 --> 11:55.250
<c.speaker>[cheering]

11:55.250 --> 11:58.083
<c.speaker>Ho-ho! You're good, Francisco!

11:58.083 --> 11:59.875
<c.speaker>I think I've got
some competition.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.000
<c.speaker>Hey, watch it!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.875
<c.speaker>Oh! Chief Zephyr.
Heh, long time, no see.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.958
<c.speaker>That is only because
you haven't been showing up
to training.

12:11.958 --> 12:13.583
<c.speaker>Come with me.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.833
<c.speaker>Have a ball, birthday girl!

12:15.833 --> 12:18.083
<c.speaker>Thank you, Cruz.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.083
<c.speaker>Yike!

12:20.416 --> 12:22.250
<c.speaker>-How'd it go?
-Not well.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.958
<c.speaker>Chief Zephyr said
I can't join the search.

12:24.958 --> 12:25.958
<c.speaker>Look at that!

12:25.958 --> 12:26.958
<c.speaker>The Scouts came back,

12:26.958 --> 12:29.208
<c.speaker>and Chief Zephyr
is leaving with Cruz.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.875
<c.speaker>Maybe they're the next shift
looking for Shuriki.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.708
<c.speaker>-Let's follow 'em.
-Wait up!

12:42.208 --> 12:43.708
<c.speaker>It's too narrow!

12:43.708 --> 12:45.958
<c.speaker>Just tilt sideways.
Like this.

12:47.958 --> 12:48.958
<c.speaker>[Elena panting]

12:48.958 --> 12:50.625
<c.speaker>[screams]

12:50.625 --> 12:51.625
<c.speaker>I can't!

12:54.416 --> 12:55.500
<c.speaker>Where'd they go?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
<c.speaker>[Elena]
There!

12:57.500 --> 12:59.000
<c.speaker>Let's get a closer look.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.500
<c.speaker>Now, Cruz, tell me
what this is.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.875
<c.speaker>Pfft, that's easy, Chief.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.083
<c.speaker>It's an old hunk of stone.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.375
<c.speaker>[sighs]
This is Commander's Rock.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.750
<c.speaker>[Chief Zephyr]
It's the most important link
to our Jaquin history.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.875
<c.speaker>Which you would know,
if you ever came to training.

13:14.875 --> 13:15.958
<c.speaker>[groans]

13:15.958 --> 13:17.875
<c.speaker>[Chief Zephyr]
I know you're wondering

13:17.875 --> 13:19.833
<c.speaker>how this monument came to be.

13:19.833 --> 13:20.833
<c.speaker>Mmm, not really.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.375
<c.speaker>So, let me tell you.

13:22.375 --> 13:26.000
<c.speaker>Years ago,
the old royal wizard,
Alacazar,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
<c.speaker>built Commander's Rock,
and he put a spell on it

13:29.000 --> 13:32.208
<c.speaker>to protect
the priceless knowledge
inside.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.458
<c.speaker>My grandfather made that?

13:34.458 --> 13:37.083
<c.speaker>[Chief Zephyr]
<i>Coyo mote tozaza. </i>

13:37.083 --> 13:38.166
<c.speaker>[sniffs]

13:38.166 --> 13:40.250
<c.speaker>Look at all that
hidden writing!

13:42.000 --> 13:45.083
<c.speaker>I guess they're not
looking for Shuriki
after all.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.625
<c.speaker>But don't you want
to check out

13:47.625 --> 13:48.958
<c.speaker>the priceless knowledge?

13:48.958 --> 13:51.000
<c.speaker>I want to catch Shuriki.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.500
<c.speaker>[Chief Zephyr]
These walls tell our stories.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.875
<c.speaker>Of good decisions leaders made
to guide us to victory,

14:00.875 --> 14:03.458
<c.speaker>and bad decisions
that led to defeat.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.750
<c.speaker>Chief? Excuse me,
sorry to jump in.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.625
<c.speaker>I'm just curious--
what does this history lesson
have to do with me?

14:08.625 --> 14:13.000
<c.speaker>To be a successful leader,
you must learn
from past leaders.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.166
<c.speaker>I'm not so interested
in past leaders.

14:15.166 --> 14:18.500
<c.speaker>They had their turn.
I'd rather focus
on the future.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.083
<c.speaker><i>My </i>future.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.708
<c.speaker>Only a fool thinks
he has nothing to learn

14:22.708 --> 14:24.000
<c.speaker>from those
who came before him.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.166
<c.speaker>Are you calling me
a fool?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.583
<c.speaker>I chose you to be
the next Chief

14:28.583 --> 14:31.250
<c.speaker>because I saw
great potential in you.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.458
<c.speaker>But you do not listen.
You show no interest
in learning.

14:34.458 --> 14:38.500
<c.speaker>You are worse than a fool!
You are a disappointment.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.875
<c.speaker>Disappointment?! Me?!
I'm awesome.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.458
<c.speaker>Some say I'd make
a better Chief than you.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.000
<c.speaker>[growls aggressively]

14:46.000 --> 14:48.708
<c.speaker>Cruz, you are no longer
the next in line.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.250
<c.speaker>You will never lead
the Avalor Jaquins.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.000
<c.speaker>Oh, you're wrong, Chief.
I <i>will </i>lead.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.958
<c.speaker>And you can stay here
with the rest
of these fossils.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.166
<c.speaker>[growls]

14:58.166 --> 14:59.208
<c.speaker>[grunts]
Hey!

15:01.875 --> 15:04.458
<c.speaker><i>Coyo mote tozaza! </i>

15:04.458 --> 15:06.583
<c.speaker>[roars]
What are you doing?!

15:06.583 --> 15:08.166
<c.speaker>Leaving the past behind.

15:09.833 --> 15:11.500
<c.speaker>Who's the fool now?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.250
<c.speaker>[Elena]
Look, another shift's
heading out.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.291
<c.speaker>Let's follow them.

15:19.291 --> 15:20.875
<c.speaker>[Jaquins grunting]

15:20.875 --> 15:22.250
<c.speaker>Hey, where were you guys?

15:22.250 --> 15:23.708
<c.speaker>Uh...

15:23.708 --> 15:25.291
<c.speaker>Gather 'round, everyone!

15:25.291 --> 15:27.958
<c.speaker>It is time for
the bestowing of the gifts.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.416
<c.speaker>Oh! Gift time!

15:34.458 --> 15:36.250
<c.speaker>[Migs]
Hey, where's Chief Zephyr?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.625
<c.speaker>He always hands out
the first one.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.166
<c.speaker>[murmuring]
-He's not here?
-Where's Chief Zephyr?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.166
<c.speaker>Cruz, do you know
where Chief Zephyr is?

15:43.166 --> 15:44.583
<c.speaker>Me? Why would I know?

15:44.583 --> 15:47.291
<c.speaker>Uh... because we just
saw you with him?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.291
<c.speaker>In the jungle.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.000
<c.speaker>By that big rock.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.208
<c.speaker>[Cruz]
Hey, everyone!

15:55.208 --> 15:56.750
<c.speaker>Chief Zephyr is missing.

15:56.750 --> 15:57.875
<c.speaker>[all gasp]

15:57.875 --> 16:00.208
<c.speaker>And... and last I saw him,

16:00.208 --> 16:02.250
<c.speaker>he was flying off
with these strangers!

16:02.250 --> 16:03.250
<c.speaker>What?!

16:04.250 --> 16:05.583
<c.speaker>He's lying!

16:05.583 --> 16:08.125
<c.speaker>Cruz would never lie to us.
He's our <i>amigo! </i>

16:08.125 --> 16:11.000
<c.speaker>And I've never seen
either of <i>you </i>before.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.333
<c.speaker>I don't remember
inviting y'all
to my party, either.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.583
<c.speaker>That's because
we're not really Jaquins.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.125
<c.speaker>It's me, Princess Elena!
And this is Mateo.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.333
<c.speaker>And I'm Gabe!

16:19.333 --> 16:21.750
<c.speaker>Hm. And I'm the queen of
Anoki-berry-ville.

16:21.750 --> 16:25.708
<c.speaker>Lock 'em up until they're ready
to tell us what they did
with Chief Zephyr.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.125
<c.speaker>What?! No!

16:27.125 --> 16:29.000
<c.speaker>-Hey, get your wings off me!
-Whoa!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.708
<c.speaker>We didn't do anything!

16:33.208 --> 16:34.625
<c.speaker>-[grunts]
-Great.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.875
<c.speaker>Now we're trapped,
Zephyr's missing,

16:36.875 --> 16:38.875
<c.speaker>and Shuriki is still
on the loose.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.083
<c.speaker>Shuriki? What's this
got to do with her?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.083
<c.speaker>Elena...

16:45.083 --> 16:47.291
<c.speaker>The real reason I came
to the Mooncliff...

16:47.291 --> 16:50.000
<c.speaker>was to join the Scouts
looking for Shuriki.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.250
<c.speaker>I owe it to my family
to find her!

16:52.250 --> 16:53.750
<c.speaker>I owe it to my kingdom.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.166
<c.speaker>You were under order
of the Grand Council!

16:57.166 --> 16:59.166
<c.speaker>I should've never
let you out of the castle.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.708
<c.speaker>I'm sorry.
I had to try!

17:01.708 --> 17:03.458
<c.speaker>Can you discuss this later?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.708
<c.speaker>Right now, we need
to figure out a way
out of here.

17:05.708 --> 17:08.375
<c.speaker>[Mingo]
Hut, two, three, four.
Oof! Two, three, four.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.208
<c.speaker>-[Mingo] Hut, two, three, four.
-I may know a way out.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.000
<c.speaker>-Hey! Mingo, Zoom, Estrella!
-[Mingo] Hut, two, three,
four. Oof!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.375
<c.speaker>It's me, Princess Elena!

17:14.375 --> 17:16.375
<c.speaker>No, you're not!
You're a bad Jaquin

17:16.375 --> 17:17.500
<c.speaker>who did something
to Chief Zephyr!

17:17.500 --> 17:19.375
<c.speaker>Yeah!

17:19.375 --> 17:21.875
<c.speaker>I'm Elena! I-- I just took
a shapeshifting potion

17:21.875 --> 17:23.375
<c.speaker>that turned me
into a Jaquin.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.250
<c.speaker>I'll prove it!
[clears throat]

17:25.250 --> 17:27.208
<c.speaker>Future Guardians, salute!

17:29.583 --> 17:32.375
<c.speaker>Hey, only Princess Elena
knew our salute.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.708
<c.speaker>Maybe it is her!

17:33.708 --> 17:35.291
<c.speaker>It has to be!

17:35.291 --> 17:36.583
<c.speaker>Can you let us
out of here?

17:38.750 --> 17:40.583
<c.speaker>Anything for our <i>princesa! </i>

17:43.333 --> 17:44.875
<c.speaker>Kids, get away
from the-- [gasps]

17:44.875 --> 17:46.750
<c.speaker>[Migs]
How did they escape?!

17:46.750 --> 17:47.958
<c.speaker>We let them go!

17:47.958 --> 17:49.416
<c.speaker>You <i>what?! </i>

17:49.416 --> 17:50.583
<c.speaker>Which way did they go?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.083
<c.speaker>[Gabe] We have to find
Chief Zephyr.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.000
<c.speaker>I think I know where he is.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
<c.speaker>Follow me!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.375
<c.speaker>Uh, guys? Look!

18:02.416 --> 18:04.875
<c.speaker>You two, keep going!
I'll take care of Cruz.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.000
<c.speaker>Let's play some skyball.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
<c.speaker>[grunts]

18:09.000 --> 18:11.458
<c.speaker>[breathes heavily]

18:11.458 --> 18:13.250
<c.speaker>Ha, ha! Think you can stop Cruz?

18:13.250 --> 18:14.250
<c.speaker>[grunts]

18:16.458 --> 18:18.125
<c.speaker>[groans]

18:19.250 --> 18:20.416
<c.speaker>Uh-oh!
[grunts]

18:23.583 --> 18:24.583
<c.speaker>[growls]

18:24.583 --> 18:26.083
<c.speaker>Hurry, Elena!

18:26.083 --> 18:27.708
<c.speaker>What was it Zephyr said?

18:27.708 --> 18:31.291
<c.speaker>[Elena]
Uh... <i>Coyo mote tozaza! </i>

18:31.291 --> 18:34.458
<c.speaker>-[grunts]
-Ha! Nice try, <i>amiga. </i>

18:38.833 --> 18:40.250
<c.speaker>[roars]

18:40.250 --> 18:42.333
<c.speaker>-Zephyr!
[all] Zephyr?!

18:43.333 --> 18:45.208
<c.speaker>-[growls]
-[gasps]

18:45.208 --> 18:48.000
<c.speaker>Traitor!
[roars]

18:48.000 --> 18:49.375
<c.speaker>Cruz did this?

18:49.375 --> 18:50.833
<c.speaker>They were telling
the truth.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.500
<c.speaker>-[roars]
-[grunts]

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
<c.speaker>Stop him!

18:54.708 --> 18:56.583
<c.speaker>We're on it!
Come on!

19:00.416 --> 19:01.416
<c.speaker>[evil chuckle]

19:13.625 --> 19:14.625
<c.speaker>[grunts]

19:15.708 --> 19:17.416
<c.speaker>[grunts]
Get him, Elena!

19:19.958 --> 19:21.500
<c.speaker>[Elena gasps]
Shortcut!

19:21.500 --> 19:23.416
<c.speaker>I can cut him off!

19:25.208 --> 19:27.458
<c.speaker>[exhales]
Just gotta tilt sideways...

19:30.375 --> 19:31.375
<c.speaker>Yes!

19:31.375 --> 19:32.708
<c.speaker>-[Elena] Gotcha!
-Uhh!

19:33.833 --> 19:35.333
<c.speaker>[grunting]

19:39.125 --> 19:40.500
<c.speaker><i>Adiós, amiga. </i>

19:40.500 --> 19:42.416
<c.speaker>[Chief Zephyr roars]

19:42.416 --> 19:46.208
<c.speaker>You're not going
anywhere, <i>amigo. </i>

19:46.208 --> 19:48.333
<c.speaker>[Jaquins growling]

19:48.333 --> 19:49.875
<c.speaker>Uh--

19:49.875 --> 19:52.500
<c.speaker>You can't keep me
locked up in here!

19:52.500 --> 19:55.875
<c.speaker>Especially once
my sister finds out.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.625
<c.speaker>Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.458
<c.speaker>Thanks for
believing me, guys.

20:00.458 --> 20:03.333
<c.speaker>You future Guardians
are always here for you!

20:03.333 --> 20:04.458
<c.speaker>[all]
Salute!

20:04.458 --> 20:05.458
<c.speaker>[squeak]
Ow!

20:05.458 --> 20:07.000
<c.speaker>Princess Elena,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.250
<c.speaker>I owe you our gratitude
for capturing Cruz.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.125
<c.speaker>But I think it would be best
if you leave the Jaquin-ing
to us.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.125
<c.speaker>Of course, Chief Zephyr.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.375
<c.speaker>You lied to me.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.166
<c.speaker>And you disobeyed
the Council.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.500
<c.speaker>Next time,
I will tell them.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.625
<c.speaker>[sighs]
You're right.

20:30.625 --> 20:31.875
<c.speaker>I won't do it again.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.375
<c.speaker>But how am I supposed
to stop Shuriki

20:33.375 --> 20:34.708
<c.speaker>if I'm stuck in the palace?

20:37.333 --> 20:41.125
<c.speaker>Huh. Hey, Mateo.
Maybe these pages

20:41.125 --> 20:43.458
<c.speaker>at the back of the Codex
weren't blank.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.333
<c.speaker>What if there was
another chapter,

20:45.333 --> 20:47.583
<c.speaker>but the Maruvians
made the writing
invisible?

20:47.583 --> 20:49.458
<c.speaker>Like Commander's Rock!

20:49.458 --> 20:50.958
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

20:50.958 --> 20:52.458
<c.speaker>What is that?

20:52.458 --> 20:54.375
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
"The Scepter of Night!"

20:54.375 --> 20:55.500
<c.speaker>The Scepter of Night?

20:55.500 --> 20:58.458
<c.speaker>"As powerful
as the Scepter of Light,

20:58.458 --> 21:02.208
<c.speaker>"the Scepter of Night
channels the darkest magic of--"

21:02.208 --> 21:04.708
<c.speaker>That's it.
The rest of the page
was ripped out.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.583
<c.speaker>That's why Fiero
stole the pages.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.416
<c.speaker>He wanted to learn
about the Scepter of Night!

21:09.416 --> 21:12.000
<c.speaker>-And where to find it.
-How do you know?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.458
<c.speaker>Look behind you.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.166
<c.speaker>-[both gasp]
-Whoa!

21:18.166 --> 21:20.583
<c.speaker>What <i>is </i>all that?

21:20.583 --> 21:23.166
<c.speaker>A hidden message
from my grandfather!

21:23.166 --> 21:24.833
<c.speaker>What does it say?

21:24.833 --> 21:27.750
<c.speaker>My grandfather discovered
the secret chapter

21:27.750 --> 21:30.416
<c.speaker>in the Codex,
but wanted to make sure

21:30.416 --> 21:32.875
<c.speaker>the Scepter of Night
didn't fall into
the wrong hands.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.000
<c.speaker>He solved the riddle
in the Codex

21:35.000 --> 21:36.416
<c.speaker>that led to the Scepter...

21:36.416 --> 21:39.458
<c.speaker>and broke it
into three pieces.

21:39.458 --> 21:41.458
<c.speaker>Then he moved the other two.

21:41.458 --> 21:45.291
<c.speaker>When you find one piece,
a riddle leads to the next.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.625
<c.speaker>Ohh. Sorry.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.583
<c.speaker>I-I was using the Scepter
too long.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.583
<c.speaker>So Shuriki and Fiero
must be heading for
the first piece!

21:52.583 --> 21:54.833
<c.speaker>Which means we know exactly
where to find them.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.333
<c.speaker>As soon as we solve
the first riddle.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.250
<c.speaker>I'm ready when you are.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.375
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

22:05.250 --> 22:07.416
