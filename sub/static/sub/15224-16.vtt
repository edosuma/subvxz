01:21.300 --> 01:24.234
Hey, guys, my play
got reviewed last night.

01:24.267 --> 01:25.234
Yeah?

01:25.267 --> 01:27.167
Take a look at this.
It's terrific.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.834
All those weeks
of hard work--

01:28.868 --> 01:30.367
they finally paid off.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.767
Well, what's it say?

01:31.801 --> 01:34.167
"The 88th Street
Actors' Workshop revival

01:34.200 --> 01:35.601
"of Arthur Miller's
timeless classic

01:35.634 --> 01:38.567
 <i>Death of a Salesman</i>
is a dog."

01:41.834 --> 01:43.000
That's terrible.

01:43.033 --> 01:46.033
Oh, just keep reading,
keep reading.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.567
"The staging is dull,

01:47.601 --> 01:50.167
"the pacing awkward,
the direction thoughtless

01:50.200 --> 01:51.601
and the acting unbalanced."

01:51.634 --> 01:53.901
Don't let this
go to your head.

01:53.934 --> 01:55.901
Forget it, forget it.

01:55.934 --> 01:58.501
Just go right down to here.

01:58.534 --> 02:01.167
"In spite of the ineptness
surrounding him,

02:01.200 --> 02:03.367
"Bobby Wheeler

02:03.400 --> 02:05.634

"which should serve
as an example of excellence

02:08.334 --> 02:10.501
for his fellow
workshop members to emulate."

02:10.533 --> 02:11.801
Hey, wow!

02:11.834 --> 02:12.968
Oh, that is some review.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.567
Thanks. The only thing
that's bothering me

02:15.601 --> 02:18.167
is I always thought this critic
was a jerk.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.400
I guess I was wrong.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.634
Hey, we won!

02:26.667 --> 02:27.667
Yeah?
Oh.

02:27.701 --> 02:28.667
Hey, Brian!

02:28.701 --> 02:29.934
You're looking at the kid

02:29.968 --> 02:31.601
who drove in
the game-winning run

02:31.634 --> 02:34.100
in one of the greatest
baseball games of all time.

02:34.133 --> 02:34.634
Oh?

02:34.667 --> 02:36.200
It was no big deal.

02:36.234 --> 02:37.567
No big deal?
Brian came to bat

02:37.601 --> 02:39.167
in the bottom
of the ninth inning.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.834
Bases loaded, two outs,
tie game.

02:41.868 --> 02:42.868
Talk about pressure.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.200
Most kids would've choked,
but not Brian.

02:45.234 --> 02:46.834
He came through
on the very first pitch.

02:46.868 --> 02:48.868
It hit me.

02:48.901 --> 02:51.801
Got him to first,
drove in the winning run.

02:51.834 --> 02:54.200
All I did was get hit
by a pitch.

02:54.234 --> 02:56.033
Yeah, but you had that pitcher
psyched out.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.968
I struck out four times.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.434
Made him cocky.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.701
When you got it, you got it.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.400
That's the way to talk.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.734
Hey, so, uh, did you ask
your foster parents

03:06.767 --> 03:08.400
about the movies on Sunday?

03:08.434 --> 03:09.601
Yeah, it's okay.

03:09.634 --> 03:11.934
Okay, come on, I'll buy you
a hot chocolate.

03:11.968 --> 03:14.267
Hey. you're coming to the gym
tomorrow, right?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.567
Can't. Tomorrow's
my Scarsdale day.

03:16.601 --> 03:17.834
Scarsdale day?

03:17.868 --> 03:19.167
What's that mean?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.167
Every Tuesday,
Brian hangs out

03:21.200 --> 03:23.868
at the Scarsdale
playgrounds,
meeting rich kids.

03:25.334 --> 03:26.868
Why is that?

03:26.901 --> 03:29.133
Rich kids have rich parents.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.934
He figures if he
hangs around the kids,

03:32.968 --> 03:34.133
gets invited home,
stays with the family,

03:34.167 --> 03:35.734
he'll get himself adopted.

03:35.767 --> 03:39.033
Oh. You know, you don't have
to be rich to adopt kids.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.601
You know that, don't you?

03:40.634 --> 03:42.000
They do to adopt me.

03:42.033 --> 03:45.434
With a face like this,
I'm shooting for big bucks.

03:47.634 --> 03:49.100
You think you're
gonna get adopted

03:49.133 --> 03:50.501
'cause of your face?

03:50.534 --> 03:51.701
Are you kidding?

03:51.734 --> 03:53.334
Look at these dimples.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.200
Ehh, not bad.

03:57.234 --> 03:58.734
Not bad?

03:58.767 --> 04:01.067
Look at them
in a better light.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.167
You're right--
they're great dimples.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.834
So, he's got to find
parents quick.

04:04.868 --> 04:07.067
You know, the older you get,
the harder it is.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.334
Yeah, most people
going to adoption agencies

04:09.367 --> 04:10.567
are looking for babies.

04:10.601 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, in this racket

04:12.033 --> 04:14.200
you're over the hill at seven.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.567
I'm almost eight.

04:15.601 --> 04:17.166
I thought you were nine.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.767
Uh-oh.
How'd you know that?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.399
Your social worker told me.

04:21.434 --> 04:22.601
Whew.

04:22.634 --> 04:25.400
I was afraid it showed.

04:25.434 --> 04:28.934
You're holding up very well
for nine.

04:28.968 --> 04:29.968
Thanks, Alex.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I got to go.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.067
Hey, Jeff.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.934
Can you run him
down to Brooklyn?

04:33.968 --> 04:35.901
I'm a little busy
right now, Tony.

04:35.934 --> 04:38.067
Please?

04:38.100 --> 04:41.467
Kid's got the cutest dimples.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.467
I don't understand

04:51.501 --> 04:53.667
why nobody wants
to adopt him.

04:53.701 --> 04:56.934
Hey, Tony, you ever
thought of adoption?

04:56.968 --> 04:59.267
I have parents.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.968
I think, I just think,
he meant adopting Brian.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.601
Are you kidding?
I'm not even married.

05:04.634 --> 05:06.868
No, you don't have to be married
to adopt.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.667
Single people do it
all the time now.

05:08.701 --> 05:09.667
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:09.701 --> 05:11.167
You think
they'd let me adopt him?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.234
Well, I don't know, Tony.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.834
Have you spent much time
around kids?

05:13.868 --> 05:17.067
Sure. I went to grade school
with hundreds of them.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.501
Oh, that's
11 years' experience.

05:20.534 --> 05:23.400
You know...

05:23.434 --> 05:25.834
I think you ought
to think about it.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.834
You'd make a great father.

05:27.868 --> 05:31.601
Wow. Me a dad.

05:31.634 --> 05:33.100
Oh, no.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.100
What?

05:34.133 --> 05:35.100
( <i>groans</i> )

05:35.133 --> 05:36.701
The <i>Long Island Bulletin</i>

05:36.734 --> 05:38.567
really let me have it.

05:38.601 --> 05:40.000
What?

05:40.033 --> 05:43.501
"Bobby Wheeler must have
a terrible case of indigestion

05:43.534 --> 05:46.834
"from all the scenery chewing
he did last night.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.033
I know I do."

05:49.067 --> 05:52.067
Well, at least
nobody reads

05:52.100 --> 05:54.801
a rag like
the <i>Long Island Bulletin.</i>

05:54.834 --> 05:55.934
LOUIE:
All right, listen up.

05:55.968 --> 05:58.167
I got a few extra copies

05:58.200 --> 06:00.567
of the <i>Long Island Bulletin.</i>

06:00.601 --> 06:02.901
Get 'em while they're hot.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.501
Hey, Wheeler,

06:04.534 --> 06:07.000
I brought you
some Rolaids.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.067
( <i>knocking</i> )

06:16.100 --> 06:17.067
It's us.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.367
All right, guys.
How are you?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.701
I'm so glad you showed up.
I really appreciate it.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.133
I'm nervous as
hell about this.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.133
Oh, Tony, just relax.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.100
Come on, I'll get some beers
or something.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.400
Hey, Tony, did you talk
to the social worker yet?

06:27.434 --> 06:28.701
Yeah, I talked to her.

06:28.734 --> 06:31.000
She says I've got
a pretty good chance
of adopting this kid.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.834
All I got to do now
is pitch it to Brian.

06:32.868 --> 06:34.868
Hey, Tony,
you sure you want us here?

06:34.901 --> 06:36.300
Oh, absolutely.

06:36.334 --> 06:39.067
I mean, Elaine, it's gonna help
having you here because

06:39.100 --> 06:40.567
you know
so much about kids.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.000
And Alex and Bobby, because you
guys are my closest friends.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.901
And Jim becau--
did I invite you?

06:45.934 --> 06:49.701
No. I thought
it was an oversight.

06:49.734 --> 06:50.901
Jim!

06:58.501 --> 07:00.567
Tony, is something burning?

07:00.601 --> 07:01.767
Lunch.

07:01.801 --> 07:03.534
Whoa!

07:04.534 --> 07:05.701
Uh-oh.

07:05.734 --> 07:09.100
Wow, did you burn that
all by yourself?

07:09.133 --> 07:12.033
Yeah, from scratch.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.934
I'm impressed.
What was it?

07:13.968 --> 07:16.467
Well, if I followed Elaine's
recipe right-- meat loaf.

07:16.501 --> 07:19.400
Tony, I told you
to cook it till
it looked brown.

07:19.434 --> 07:22.734
Yeah, but it was hard to see it
through all that smoke.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.133
Well, I think
I can save it.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.734
You know, I'm so excited about
this, I can't sleep at night.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.934
I mean, the last couple days,
you know what I did?

07:28.968 --> 07:31.167
What?
Checked out schools in the area.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.501
And I found an apartment
down the hall with a bedroom.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.501
And I mean,
there's just so much to do.

07:36.534 --> 07:37.834
Look at this guy.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.901
Tony, just calm down.
It's going to be terrific.

07:39.934 --> 07:41.501
Oh, sure, that's easy
for <i>you</i> to say.

07:41.534 --> 07:45.300
All you had to do
to get kids was give birth.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.300
Gee, I feel so guilty I
took the simple way out.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.501
( <i>knocking</i> )

07:49.534 --> 07:51.701
That's him.

07:51.734 --> 07:52.968
That's Brian.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.767
You know, all of a sudden,
I feel real strange

07:55.801 --> 07:58.701
doing this in front
of a bunch of people, you know?

07:58.734 --> 08:00.434
I mean, it's kind of personal.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.667
Tony, what do you
want us to do?

08:02.701 --> 08:04.300
Could you wait
in the other room?

08:04.334 --> 08:05.501
Tony...

08:05.534 --> 08:09.100
the only other room
is the bathroom.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.701
I'd really appreciate it.

08:10.734 --> 08:11.901
Well, what the heck.

08:11.934 --> 08:13.300
Let's give it a try.

08:13.334 --> 08:14.501
Yo!
Jim, come on.

08:14.534 --> 08:17.100
We're going to hide
in the bathroom.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.534
Okay, but I better warn you--
I'm good at this.

08:30.334 --> 08:32.299
One thousand one...
one thousand...

08:32.333 --> 08:33.701
No, no, Jim, Jim.

08:33.734 --> 08:36.701
You're going
to hide with us.

08:36.734 --> 08:40.000
Okay, but you're making it
a lot easier.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.767
One thousand one...

08:44.367 --> 08:46.667
( <i>knocking</i> )

08:46.701 --> 08:48.734
Tony, I made it.

08:48.767 --> 08:51.000
I found a couple--
the Brennans--

08:51.033 --> 08:52.501
and they're loaded.

08:52.534 --> 08:54.501
What are you talking about?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.434
I was at the Scarsdale
playground when I met a kid.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.567
He's staying
with his aunt and uncle.

08:59.601 --> 09:03.801
I got invited home for dinner,
and now they want me to move in.

09:05.601 --> 09:07.167
These people already said

09:07.200 --> 09:08.968
they're going
to adopt you?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.834
No, they just asked me
to stay for a while

09:11.868 --> 09:13.200
but, once I'm there,

09:13.234 --> 09:15.567
they'll get used
to having me around.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.601
Have you checked this out
with your foster parents?

09:17.634 --> 09:20.434
Yeah. I even talked
to my social worker.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.334
The agency, too.

09:22.367 --> 09:25.734
Believe me, this little waif
is home free.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.467
What's that?

09:27.501 --> 09:31.467
Oh, that's some meat loaf
I cooked us up for lunch.

09:31.501 --> 09:33.100
I'm a vegetarian.

09:33.133 --> 09:36.100
When did you
become a vegetarian?

09:36.133 --> 09:39.167
When I looked
at this meat loaf.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.868
( <i>horn honking</i> )

09:40.901 --> 09:43.100
That's the Brennans.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.934
They're waiting downstairs
for me.

09:44.968 --> 09:46.467
I got to go.

09:46.501 --> 09:49.467
Hey, Brian,
are you sure this is it?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.300
This is what you want?

09:51.334 --> 09:53.067
Close enough.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.834
Hey, Brian, maybe
somebody will come along

09:54.868 --> 09:55.868
who wants to adopt you--

09:55.901 --> 09:57.534
somebody even better
than the Brennans.

09:57.567 --> 10:01.901
You mean Princess Grace
answered my letter?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.601
Oh... what I mean is...

10:03.634 --> 10:06.467
Brian, are you sure
the Brennans are it?

10:06.501 --> 10:08.634
I mean, is your mind made up?

10:08.667 --> 10:11.501
I know a good deal
when I see it.

10:11.534 --> 10:12.834
( <i>clinking</i> )

10:15.367 --> 10:18.868
Tony, I think there's
someone in your bathroom.

10:18.901 --> 10:22.067
Oh, yeah, that's Alex,
Elaine, Bobby and Jim.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.968
They had to freshen up.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.167
Oh, yeah.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.267
You told me they do
everything together.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.467
See you.

10:31.501 --> 10:33.567
 ALL:
 <i>Bye, Brian.</i>

10:35.567 --> 10:39.000
Well, I got to split.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.734
See you.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.667
Hey.

10:43.701 --> 10:44.868
Come on, Tony.

10:44.901 --> 10:47.167
We're still friends.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.133
We can still go
to the games together,

10:50.167 --> 10:52.367
and I'll treat from now on.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.834
Yeah, sure, why...
you know. Sure.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.200
See you.

11:00.601 --> 11:02.267
( <i>door closes</i> )

11:04.801 --> 11:06.100
We heard, Tony.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.601
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.100
I can't believe Brian
would do that to you, man.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.601
Oh, just forget it.
You know, kids
are impulsive.

11:12.634 --> 11:14.868
They change
their minds all
the time. Really

11:14.901 --> 11:16.467
You don't know Brian.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.267
Oh, Tony, are you okay?

11:18.300 --> 11:20.033
Yeah, I'm all right.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.467
Hey, if you guys don't mind,

11:21.501 --> 11:23.467
I'd like to be alone
for a little while.

11:23.501 --> 11:25.267
Yeah, okay. We
understand. Let's go.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.267
Sure.
We understand.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.601
Listen.
Call me, you know?

11:30.367 --> 11:31.534
See you, Tony.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.901
Bye.

11:34.234 --> 11:36.634
Ready or not,
here I come!

11:44.701 --> 11:46.567
Don't help me.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.601
Here you go.

11:56.601 --> 11:59.934
Hey, what a night
you had.

11:59.968 --> 12:02.434
You're getting the hang
of this, huh, Banta?

12:02.467 --> 12:03.534
Hey, Louie,
if you don't mind,

12:03.567 --> 12:05.567
I'd like to drive
the day shift, too.

12:05.601 --> 12:06.901
Hey, uh, Tony...

12:06.934 --> 12:09.534
want to take a break
and have a cup of coffee?

12:09.567 --> 12:10.934
Nah. I want to hit
the streets, man.

12:10.968 --> 12:12.534
What are you trying
to prove, huh?

12:12.567 --> 12:14.901
Nothing. I'm just
trying to make
some extra money.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.801
Tony, you're not going
to win Brian back

12:16.834 --> 12:18.367
by hustling more fares,
you know.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.734
You cannot compete financially
with the Brennans.

12:20.767 --> 12:21.901
I'm not competing.

12:21.934 --> 12:23.267
I just feel
like driving more

12:23.300 --> 12:24.501
since he walked
out on me.

12:24.534 --> 12:26.067
ELAINE:
Tony, don't blame Brian.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.834
He's just a confused little boy.

12:28.868 --> 12:30.167
You know something?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.100
I'm getting sick and tired
of all this tolerance.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.901
I mean, we're talking
about a nine-year-old kid

12:33.934 --> 12:35.133
whose values are all messed up,

12:35.167 --> 12:36.734
and I think we should
stop tolerating him

12:36.767 --> 12:38.033
just because he's
had a hard life.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.567
What are you getting
so mad about, Alex?

12:39.601 --> 12:40.601
What I'm
getting mad about?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.200
I'll tell you what
I'm getting mad about.

12:42.234 --> 12:43.701
I'm getting mad
that he did this

12:43.734 --> 12:45.000
and that you
let him do it,

12:45.033 --> 12:47.467
and that money
perverts our values
and hurts people,

12:47.501 --> 12:49.567
and that money stinks,
and that I don't have any.

12:49.601 --> 12:51.834
No, no, no, no.
Tony, Tony, look, now.

12:51.868 --> 12:54.868
I think somebody's got
to straighten that kid out.

12:54.901 --> 12:56.567
In fact, I think you
ought to go over
to the Brennan house

12:56.601 --> 12:57.901
and tell the kid you're
going to adopt him.

12:57.934 --> 13:00.501
Why not?
Oh, no. I'm not arguing
with Brian over this.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.968
Because, every time
I argue with him,
he outwits me.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I've seen you outwitted
by a pop-top can.

13:07.033 --> 13:09.701
Besides, I can't go
intruding in on the Brennans.

13:09.734 --> 13:12.968
I mean, number one: I'd feel
uncomfortable just barging in.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.334
Number two: I don't know

13:14.367 --> 13:16.234
how to act
around people like that.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.601
And, number three:
They don't even know me.

13:18.634 --> 13:19.901
You know,
Number four...

13:19.934 --> 13:22.400
you're just
making excuses,
and you know that.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.734
Maybe you're right,
Alex.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.934
Maybe I'll go over there
this afternoon.

13:25.968 --> 13:27.634
That's the way
to talk. Great.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.667
If you'll go with me.

13:29.701 --> 13:31.567
Hmm? Nah. Me? I'm not
going to go over there.

13:31.601 --> 13:32.567
Why not?

13:32.601 --> 13:33.601
Well, number one:

13:33.634 --> 13:35.467
I'd feel uncomfortable
intruding on them.

13:35.501 --> 13:37.133
Number two:
They don't even know me.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.267
Number three: I don't
know how to act

13:39.300 --> 13:40.667
around people like that.

13:40.701 --> 13:41.734
And, number four...

13:41.767 --> 13:43.667
What did you say
number four was?

13:55.567 --> 13:56.601
Mr. Brennan asked

13:56.634 --> 13:58.534
if you would wait
in the library.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.200
Is it far from here?

14:00.234 --> 14:01.801
This is the library.

14:01.834 --> 14:05.467
Oh, they got one
in their house.

14:05.501 --> 14:08.467
I'll tell Mr. and Mrs. Brennan
you're here.

14:08.501 --> 14:09.834
Thank you.

14:11.534 --> 14:14.601
Wow! Who'd build a nice house
like this

14:14.634 --> 14:17.167
next to a bunch of stables?

14:17.200 --> 14:21.701
Maybe the house was here first,
and the horses moved in later.

14:21.734 --> 14:23.667
Makes more sense.

14:23.701 --> 14:25.334
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Alex.

14:25.367 --> 14:26.334
Hey, Brian.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.334
This is a great place
you got here.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.367
I'm sure here
are disadvantages,
too. Aren't there?

14:30.400 --> 14:31.567
Yeah, you're right.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.000
The pool's overheated.

14:33.033 --> 14:35.901
Oh, well, suffering
builds character,
kid. You know?

14:35.934 --> 14:37.167
Hello.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.167
Hello.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.801
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Brennan,

14:39.834 --> 14:41.501
this is Tony
and Alex.

14:41.534 --> 14:42.501
Oh, Tony, Alex.

14:42.534 --> 14:43.667
It's a pleasure.

14:43.701 --> 14:45.467
We've heard a lot about you.

14:45.501 --> 14:46.801
Especially you, Tony.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.267
I understand
you're an excellent boxer.

14:50.934 --> 14:54.467
I stretched it a little.

14:54.501 --> 14:57.434
Brian says you have a very
impressive knockout record.

14:57.467 --> 15:00.000
Oh, yeah. Once, I was out
for almost an hour.

15:04.801 --> 15:06.968
Well, I hope
to be a contender someday

15:07.000 --> 15:09.767
but, right now,
I make my living driving a cab.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.100
Shall we sit down?

15:11.133 --> 15:12.100
Please, sit.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.133
Oh, thanks.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.133
And what
do you do, Alex?

15:15.167 --> 15:17.133
Me? I drive
a cab also.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.501
And you box, too?

15:18.534 --> 15:20.400
No, I just drive a cab.

15:20.434 --> 15:22.067
Oh, Well, what
do you want to do?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.601
Quit.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.801
May I offer you
a brandy?

15:26.834 --> 15:27.968
Oh, you bet.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.400
Thank you.

15:29.434 --> 15:31.133
If you gentlemen
will excuse me,

15:31.167 --> 15:32.634
I have to check on dinner.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.801
Will you be staying?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.100
No, I don't think so.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.734
Well, if you change your minds,
you're certainly welcome.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.067
Thank you.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.267
And you, young man,

15:40.300 --> 15:43.501
be sure and wash your hands
before dinner.

15:43.534 --> 15:46.033
I wish she'd
take off her rings

15:46.067 --> 15:47.834
before she does that.

15:47.868 --> 15:50.100
Well, Tony, I admit

15:50.133 --> 15:53.067
I don't know very
much about boxing,

15:53.100 --> 15:55.667
but I do find
Muhammad Ali interesting.

15:55.701 --> 15:57.534
What's he doing these days?

15:57.567 --> 15:59.701
Last time I saw him,

15:59.734 --> 16:02.133
he was in Alaska
selling batteries.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.133
Uh... thank you.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.667
You know,
if you're short

16:04.701 --> 16:06.968
on brandy,
I could have a beer.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.067
Oh, no.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.834
That's the amount of brandy
you're supposed to get.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.667
Oh... right, right.

16:17.868 --> 16:19.801
Well, I... I did
a lot of odd jobs

16:19.834 --> 16:21.734
while I was going
through school,

16:21.767 --> 16:23.133
but I never
drove a cab.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.167
What's that like?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.033
Well, it's a lot like boxing,

16:26.067 --> 16:28.601
only there are
a lot fewer people around

16:28.634 --> 16:30.000
when you get beat up.

16:30.033 --> 16:34.434
Uncle John, you got
a long distance telephone call.

16:34.467 --> 16:35.801
Oh, thank you.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.200
Excuse me,
Alex, Tony.

16:37.234 --> 16:40.467
Hey, Brian, you
want to go play
tennis before dinner?

16:40.501 --> 16:43.367
Sorry, Tommy.
I'm visiting
with my friends.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.667
Tony and Alex, this is Tommy,
the Brennans' nephew.

16:46.701 --> 16:47.734
Nice meeting you.

16:47.767 --> 16:48.767
Oh, hi, Tommy.

16:48.801 --> 16:49.767
Nice meeting you.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.067
Before I came along,

16:52.100 --> 16:55.367
this was their
idea of cute.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.734
Catch you later.

16:58.801 --> 17:04.000
Brian, Alex and I got to go.

17:04.032 --> 17:05.200
You just got here.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.400
I know, but we just
wanted to stop by

17:06.434 --> 17:08.133
and see how you were doing,
and you're doing great,

17:08.166 --> 17:09.300
so we're going
to get out of here.

17:09.334 --> 17:11.133
Oh, no, no, no.
Damn it, you're
not going to leave here

17:11.166 --> 17:13.000
until you tell that kid
what you came here to tell him.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.800
But you see
his mind's made up.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.467
I'm sorry.
I don't buy that.

17:16.501 --> 17:20.067
Listen kid, there are a lot more
important things in this life

17:20.099 --> 17:21.133
than money, you know?

17:21.166 --> 17:22.800
Name three.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.133
Friends, happiness
and health.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.968
Three that money can't buy.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.934
You're right. He's great.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.634
Brian, I was hoping

17:32.667 --> 17:34.868
you weren't going
to be so happy here

17:34.901 --> 17:37.067
so it wasn't so terrific.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.100
Why?

17:38.133 --> 17:41.334
Brian, uh...

17:41.367 --> 17:43.234
On your knees.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.968
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.100
and I didn't mention it
to you before because...

17:53.133 --> 17:56.133
well, I had to make sure
it was going to work,

17:56.167 --> 17:58.834
and because you had
the Brennans and all...

17:58.868 --> 18:00.701
but I think you're terrific.

18:00.734 --> 18:03.167
I'd be so proud
if you were my son.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.767
We'd have great times together.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.667
And I'd do,,,
I'd do my very best

18:06.701 --> 18:09.400
to make your life
the best it can be.

18:09.434 --> 18:12.100
Geez, what kind
of choice is this

18:12.133 --> 18:13.968
for an eight-year-old?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.434
A nine-year-old.

18:15.467 --> 18:19.000
Oh, we're going
to get nasty.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.467
So you don't want me
to be your dad?

18:23.501 --> 18:24.968
You make it hard.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.133
Yeah, well, he can make it
a lot tougher, you know.

18:27.167 --> 18:28.634
How?

18:28.667 --> 18:30.701
Well, by mentioning
a few things...

18:30.734 --> 18:33.767
like all the great times
that you two have had together.

18:33.801 --> 18:35.133
Things like that, huh?

18:35.167 --> 18:36.467
( <i>clears throat</i> )

18:36.501 --> 18:38.534
Hmm? Down on my knees?

18:39.767 --> 18:43.133
Like how big a part of your life
Tony is, and vice versa.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.133
And how he wants to adopt you
because he loves you,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.467
not because he
feels sorry for you.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.868
And maybe, just maybe,

18:48.901 --> 18:50.934
because of a feeling
that he has,

18:50.968 --> 18:53.100
and that I have,
and maybe even you have,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.701
that you would be
a lot happier with Tony

18:55.734 --> 18:58.033
than you could be
with these people.

18:59.868 --> 19:01.767
Tony, I'm sorry.

19:01.801 --> 19:06.033
But I've got to think
about my future.

19:13.501 --> 19:15.467
You're right.

19:15.501 --> 19:18.067
Let's get out of here.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.467
Nice meeting you,
Mrs. Brennan.

19:19.501 --> 19:21.000
Oh. Leaving so soon?

19:21.033 --> 19:23.634
Yeah. We just remembered
we got something else to do.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.634
Well, I'm glad
you dropped by.
Come again.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.100
Oh, thanks.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.901
Listen, if you ever think
about adopting an older kid--

19:29.934 --> 19:31.434
like, 42 years old--

19:31.467 --> 19:32.801
call me.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.501
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

19:48.534 --> 19:49.834
Hello.

19:49.868 --> 19:52.834
Oh, hi, Alex. How you doing?

19:52.868 --> 19:54.501
No, man, no.

19:54.534 --> 19:56.501
I'm not in the mood
to see anything

19:56.534 --> 19:57.868
I got to think about.

19:57.901 --> 20:00.667
 And I already seen
 <i>Horse Feathers</i> anyway.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.834
Yeah. Yeah. No.
I'll give you a call.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.334
Okay. Bye, man.

20:04.367 --> 20:08.434
Man, the traffic in this city
is incredible!

20:10.167 --> 20:12.501
Brian, you changed
your mind.

20:12.534 --> 20:13.834
Sure did.

20:13.868 --> 20:16.601
Have any extra hangers?

20:16.634 --> 20:18.033
This is great!

20:18.067 --> 20:19.901
I knew you'd
come through.

20:19.934 --> 20:24.367
There's more important things
in this world than money.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.033
Oh, man. Am I happy
to hear you say that.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.701
Hey, Brian, I swear,
I'm going to make this work.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.133
You'll see.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.734
Hey, did the Brennans
take it hard?

20:32.767 --> 20:33.734
They'll get over it.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.100
Well, maybe
I should call them

20:35.133 --> 20:37.234
and let them know
that you got here okay, huh?

20:37.267 --> 20:38.701
Don't bother.

20:38.734 --> 20:41.400
Nah. They'll worry
if I don't do it.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.667
Tony, I said don't.

20:48.968 --> 20:50.601
What's going on, Brian?

20:50.634 --> 20:53.267
Oh, you're never going
to believe this,

20:53.300 --> 20:55.634
but they didn't want
to adopt me.

20:59.434 --> 21:01.434
Do you have any shoe trees?

21:05.334 --> 21:07.234
They didn't want you?
How come?

21:07.267 --> 21:10.167
I don't know.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.834
I guess they got no taste.

21:12.868 --> 21:16.200
I'm going to need
a drawer.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.000
I see.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.701
So you're ready
to settle for me now?

21:21.734 --> 21:22.934
You got it, Dad.

21:22.968 --> 21:26.300
Why don't you burn something up
for dinner?

21:33.434 --> 21:34.734
"Dad" nothing.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.834
I ain't going to be
nobody's second choice.

21:36.868 --> 21:38.868
Sure, you're ready to come back
to me now

21:38.901 --> 21:40.234
'cause they don't want you.

21:40.267 --> 21:43.200
Hey, come on, Pop.
Lighten up.

21:43.234 --> 21:44.868
Hey, Brian, tell me something.

21:44.901 --> 21:47.334
What happens tomorrow
if a family even richer

21:47.367 --> 21:50.567
than the Brennans comes along,
and they want to adopt you?

21:50.601 --> 21:51.767
You'll go with them?

21:51.801 --> 21:55.534
Hey, come on, Tony, remember?

21:55.567 --> 21:57.667
We're buddies.

21:57.701 --> 22:01.701
Think of all the good times
we can have together.

22:03.033 --> 22:05.167
Don't hit me
with that smile, Brian.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.267
Dimples either.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.801
I know all those
tricks, man,

22:10.834 --> 22:12.701
and none of them
are going to work.

22:12.734 --> 22:15.067
You know, I've taken
some shots in my life,

22:15.100 --> 22:16.701
but the ones
you've given me--

22:16.734 --> 22:18.200
they topped them all.

22:18.234 --> 22:20.901
So just pack what you unpacked
and hit the road, pal.

22:24.367 --> 22:28.767
Tony, I didn't want
to have to say this,

22:28.801 --> 22:32.067
but... you backed me
into a corner.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.234
I love you, Tony.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.400
There's such a thing
as being too easy.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.534
Hey, wait a minute.

22:59.567 --> 23:02.300
I'll tell you
what I'll do.

23:02.334 --> 23:03.667
Let's cut these
cards right now--

23:03.701 --> 23:05.367
see whether
you stay or leave.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.701
High card wins.

23:06.734 --> 23:08.567
I can't be
any fairer
than that, can I?

23:08.601 --> 23:11.167
Yeah, you're right.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.834
That's fair.

23:12.868 --> 23:15.267
Okay, but I'll tell
you something, Brian.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.767
This is it.
This is the final one.

23:16.801 --> 23:20.167
Win or lose,
you got to stick
by the consequences.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.534
Okay.

23:24.067 --> 23:26.434
Come on, high card.

23:26.467 --> 23:27.834
Come on, high card.

23:27.868 --> 23:29.400
You go first.

23:35.734 --> 23:38.067
It's an eight.

23:41.234 --> 23:43.234
It's a king.

23:43.267 --> 23:44.601
I win.

23:49.033 --> 23:51.033
I get to keep you.
