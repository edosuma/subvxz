The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

00:06.121 --> 00:08.740
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.740 --> 00:11.837
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.837 --> 00:13.707
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.707 --> 00:15.554
These are their stories.

00:32.472 --> 00:34.566
I'm coming for ya!

00:39.023 --> 00:43.491
And while my investigation
was unauthorized,

00:43.491 --> 00:46.617
I feel it was the only way to...

00:46.617 --> 00:48.206
uncover the truth.

00:48.206 --> 00:51.174
Pending a departmental hearing
and a psychological evaluation,

00:51.174 --> 00:52.949
you are suspended.

00:52.949 --> 00:58.042
You think that I wasn't playing insane,
that I am insane.

00:58.482 --> 01:00.472
Have you ever asked yourself
that question?

01:06.879 --> 01:09.286
And he said,
"I gave it up for lent."

01:12.640 --> 01:16.191
Now we both know you did not see...

01:16.787 --> 01:18.173
who shot Quinn.

01:18.173 --> 01:19.673
Screw you.

01:26.902 --> 01:28.581
You got some balls.

01:29.483 --> 01:30.962
What the hell are you dong here?

01:31.303 --> 01:32.677
It's my neighborhood bar.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.147
Not tonight it's not.

01:34.954 --> 01:38.056
My old precinct's doing
a 10-13 benefit for me.

01:38.928 --> 01:41.981
I wouldn't need their charity
if you hadn't cost me my job.

01:41.981 --> 01:44.185
I don't want any trouble.

01:44.844 --> 01:46.444
You cheated me out of my retirement.

01:46.444 --> 01:48.277
- Look, why...
- That's all you have to say?

01:49.745 --> 01:51.477
Come on. I had one year to go.

01:51.477 --> 01:53.351
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

01:53.351 --> 01:55.010
- What?
- Come on.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.404
Be smart.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.271
You want someone to call 911, huh?

01:59.271 --> 02:01.062
You want IAD in here?

02:01.327 --> 02:02.588
Rat.

02:11.728 --> 02:14.342
I... I know you didn't need
my help with that.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.148
Do I know you?

02:18.751 --> 02:22.218
Mike Stoat.
Brooklyn North, Narcotics.

02:22.899 --> 02:24.393
Cause of you.

02:24.643 --> 02:26.993
I was a rookie when you worked Narcotics.
What was it?

02:26.993 --> 02:31.238
27 arrests, 27 convictions.
All heavy hitters.

02:32.261 --> 02:33.620
You got a good memory.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.830
I also remember
you weren't too popular.

02:36.908 --> 02:38.803
Guess some things never change, huh?

02:40.001 --> 02:41.816
I'm on suspension.

02:41.816 --> 02:44.645
They had me pee in a cup,
and it came back positive.

02:44.645 --> 02:46.307
I was undercover.

02:47.051 --> 02:49.706
I had to do a bump of coke
so I wouldn't get made.

02:50.263 --> 02:52.431
But you know how the department is.

02:54.955 --> 02:56.664
With or without pay?

02:56.664 --> 02:59.491
Six months without.
Just like you.

03:03.128 --> 03:04.673
Wait a minute, so...

03:06.443 --> 03:08.487
This just now, this was a setup?

03:08.487 --> 03:11.622
No, look, I don't know
that guy from Adam.

03:12.802 --> 03:14.660
But I am looking for you.

03:15.419 --> 03:19.053
You and me, we could help each other.
You know.

03:19.053 --> 03:23.590
I make more money on suspension
than I ever did on the job.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.003
- This is legit?
- Yeah.

03:28.003 --> 03:29.860
Security work.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.058
Hey, I'll do right by you. Huh?

03:38.510 --> 03:40.576
Hey, I gotta go.

03:40.576 --> 03:43.974
You call me if you're interested.
All right?

03:46.628 --> 03:48.819
- You forgot your paper.
- Keep it.

05:01.414 --> 05:03.942
Good morning.
Hope you had your coffee.

05:04.404 --> 05:08.336
Um, just finishing up.
I'm about to go see my family.

05:08.715 --> 05:10.838
There's been a shooting in Red Hook.

05:10.838 --> 05:14.539
A drug dealer...
two English tourists.

05:15.795 --> 05:17.624
Anybody out of the picture?

05:17.874 --> 05:19.147
All three.

05:19.591 --> 05:21.567
You can call your family on the way.

05:23.996 --> 05:27.580
ID on him is Wilson Crawford.
23, Bed-stuy.

05:27.580 --> 05:31.117
Anonymous call of shots fired
came in at 11:00 pm.

05:31.489 --> 05:34.777
- No witnesses?
- You mean, besides the tourists?

05:37.991 --> 05:40.353
Do a canvass of the block
and the adjoining alleys.

05:40.353 --> 05:43.420
I want to know if any of these places
was still open at the time of the shooting.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.624
Okay.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.590
Eames.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.071
I'm guessing you find yourself in Red Hook.

05:51.071 --> 05:52.700
Because of the tourists
and not the drug dealer.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.911
Happy Easter.

05:53.911 --> 05:55.223
Where's your partner?

05:55.223 --> 05:57.856
Still jumping through NYPD hoops.

05:58.449 --> 05:59.936
He looks like a user.

05:59.936 --> 06:02.705
And a dealer.
Ten grams of coke in his pocket.

06:02.705 --> 06:04.672
Drug deal gone bad?

06:05.091 --> 06:08.587
Then why leave the coke on him?
It's more likely fighting over territory.

06:08.957 --> 06:11.290
And the tourists, collateral damage.

06:11.290 --> 06:12.574
Looks that way.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.629
Jerry and Victoria Bennett.

06:14.629 --> 06:16.692
Passengers from a cruise ship.

06:16.692 --> 06:18.549
It left Southampton, England,

06:18.549 --> 06:22.358
docked over at the Red Hook terminal
over that way yesterday afternoon.

06:22.358 --> 06:24.572
They never even made it to Manhattan.

06:24.804 --> 06:27.440
By the time the paramedics arrived,
it was too late.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.562
Welcome to New York.

07:03.963 --> 07:06.748
He has a short exit wound
on the back of his skull.

07:06.748 --> 07:09.754
So he was lying on the ground
when he was shot.

07:10.478 --> 07:11.770
The slug?

07:12.264 --> 07:15.344
Non-jacketed 9-millimeter.

07:15.344 --> 07:17.080
Pulled from the pavement.

07:17.602 --> 07:19.334
Autopsy's done already.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.084
You guys at Major Case have some pull.

07:22.084 --> 07:24.001
I used it to get you
temporarily assigned to me.

07:24.001 --> 07:26.683
You'll be working with Eames
on this one. Okay?

07:27.543 --> 07:29.723
Until Goren comes back.

07:30.205 --> 07:32.317
He was knocked around
pretty bad before he was shot?

07:32.317 --> 07:34.109
Eh, broken ribs.

07:34.109 --> 07:37.146
Lacerations and contusions
on his face and arms.

07:37.883 --> 07:40.255
Stippling on his palms.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.740
He put his hands up
right before he was shot.

07:42.740 --> 07:44.684
He was alive and saw it coming.

07:44.684 --> 07:47.740
These three dots stand for Mi Vida Loca.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.047
An understatement.

07:49.047 --> 07:50.900
But not necessarily gang-related.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.178
And this... a clock with no hands
means doing time.

07:54.178 --> 07:57.618
He did three years in Sing Sing
on a drug-related assault.

07:57.866 --> 08:01.366
He's got two gang tats on his back,
but he's tried to have them removed.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.942
He probably only needed
the protection when he was in prison.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.289
Yeah, or maybe he was familiar
with tat stats.

08:07.289 --> 08:10.644
More than five, twice as likely
to die a violent death.

08:11.381 --> 08:14.012
And then there's wrong place, wrong time.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.002
You mean the Bennetts?

08:16.002 --> 08:19.527
Or do you mean putting a passenger cruise
ship terminal in the middle of Red Hook?

08:21.451 --> 08:24.572
Your partner's been on suspension
for five months?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.601
I didn't think they could
keep you out that long.

08:26.601 --> 08:28.795
They can't but they have.

08:29.548 --> 08:30.970
What the hell did he...

08:35.054 --> 08:37.586
A couple of the guys upstairs
told me he snapped.

08:41.484 --> 08:42.991
He didn't snap.

08:42.991 --> 08:46.937
He was undercover in a prison psych ward.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.904
Rikers?

08:53.904 --> 08:56.992
No. Tates Corrections.

08:58.346 --> 09:01.491
Tates, that's upstate.
How did he get jurisdiction for that?

09:01.937 --> 09:03.622
He didn't.

09:03.622 --> 09:06.021
He went in on his own.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.932
Oh.

09:12.284 --> 09:14.056
He had his reasons.

09:37.017 --> 09:39.524
Yeah, Stoat, it's Goren.

09:40.324 --> 09:43.729
Yeah, uh...
Yeah... I'm in.

09:45.402 --> 09:47.331
Where do you want me?

09:59.773 --> 10:01.126
How you doing, sugar?

10:02.424 --> 10:05.021
Come on in.
Sorry, pal, beat it.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.093
- You miss the job?
- What do you think, huh?

10:18.424 --> 10:19.986
I was a good cop.

10:20.490 --> 10:21.752
I had four commendations.

10:21.752 --> 10:25.683
One for rescuing a three-year-old girl
from her father who had a glock to her head,

10:25.683 --> 10:27.896
one for talking a jumper down.

10:28.457 --> 10:31.393
Hell, the way things are headed,
I might need someone to talk me down.

10:35.637 --> 10:38.888
- How did you end up here?
- I busted the owner once.

10:40.289 --> 10:43.542
Look, I got an ex-wife. Right?

10:43.542 --> 10:46.427
I got a nine-year-old kid
who loves hockey more than anything.

10:46.427 --> 10:48.991
He wants to be the next Jaromir Jagr.

10:48.991 --> 10:50.581
What am I gonna do?

10:51.432 --> 10:53.852
Hey, what's up, Oksana?
There you go, baby.

11:01.359 --> 11:03.450
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

11:03.450 --> 11:04.929
What the hell you doing?

11:05.191 --> 11:08.079
Goren, Goren, Goren,
Goren, Goren, Goren, Goren.

11:08.079 --> 11:09.466
Let him go.

11:09.939 --> 11:13.229
Say hi to your new boss.
Mr. Testarossa.

11:14.384 --> 11:16.079
Take it easy, cowboy.

11:23.562 --> 11:26.406
The Yuppies and IKEA and
fairway are here.

11:26.406 --> 11:29.245
And there's the industrial area
down by the waterfront.

11:29.245 --> 11:30.440
Still mob run.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.404
Or it was until two months ago when
the feeds busted 50 members of the Nicoli family.

11:34.404 --> 11:37.616
Since then, it's open season.
Murder rate's way up.

11:37.616 --> 11:40.519
Four dealers shot in the past six weeks.

11:40.519 --> 11:43.644
Lock up the career criminals
and you start a turf war.

11:43.644 --> 11:46.108
The law of unintended consequences.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.200
Can you give us any names?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.575
Not yet.
OCCB is playing catch-up.

11:50.575 --> 11:52.521
Right now, it looks like
a bunch of wannabes

11:52.521 --> 11:54.822
and second-stringers moving up
the food chain.

11:55.948 --> 11:59.371
Including Mr. Crawford.
How's his rap sheet?

11:59.371 --> 12:01.992
Low level drug dealer.
Pleads down every time.

12:01.992 --> 12:03.288
Who's he with?

12:03.288 --> 12:06.435
Looks like freelance.
Except his last three arrests,

12:06.435 --> 12:09.818
he's had the same partner,
Keyshawn Powell,

12:09.818 --> 12:13.498
who up until two weeks ago was in Rikers.

12:13.498 --> 12:14.729
Paroled.

12:14.729 --> 12:16.196
And more in luck.

12:16.196 --> 12:20.180
He has to see Dr. Lane as
court-appointed shrink twice a week.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.151
Hey, rook. Hop in.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.043
So how did you know
where to find me?

12:37.043 --> 12:38.676
I told you, I got hooks.

12:39.283 --> 12:41.871
Dr. Olivet tell you
that you have anger issues?

12:42.458 --> 12:43.708
Came up.

12:44.628 --> 12:48.933
You ask me, 15 years on the NYPD
without any anger issues,

12:48.933 --> 12:51.285
then you relay do need to see a shrink.

13:01.034 --> 13:02.751
So where are we working today?
Where we going?

13:02.751 --> 13:04.230
Private party.
Strip club.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.037
Sports on big screens.

13:06.037 --> 13:08.132
Steaks. Women in thongs.

13:08.132 --> 13:09.845
What is not to love?

13:09.845 --> 13:11.924
Same guy who owns the nightclub?

13:11.924 --> 13:13.652
I don't know who owns what.

13:14.346 --> 13:15.692
Neither do you.

13:27.913 --> 13:29.490
Dr. Lane?

13:37.593 --> 13:38.920
Dr. Lane?

13:40.079 --> 13:42.304
Did we catch you at a bad time?

13:43.038 --> 13:45.574
Saturday night?
I don't know where I was.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.379
But I wasn't in no trouble.

13:47.379 --> 13:49.082
My life's good on parole right now.

13:49.082 --> 13:50.437
Apparently.

13:50.437 --> 13:52.404
Dr Lane, she's been helping me.

13:52.404 --> 13:55.468
My guess is, she's gonna
be taken off you case.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.534
That's on her. I was seduced.

13:59.167 --> 14:02.560
Look, Keyshawn, you help us,
maybe we can help you.

14:02.560 --> 14:06.033
No, thanks.
I'm from Brooklyn.

14:06.033 --> 14:08.575
I've had enough of NYPD deals.

14:09.004 --> 14:12.822
Your partner, Wilson Crawford,
was executed Saturday night.

14:12.822 --> 14:14.066
Don't do that.

14:15.638 --> 14:16.955
I heard what happened to him.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.768
What gang was he working for?

14:18.768 --> 14:19.979
Wilson? No. No.

14:19.979 --> 14:23.181
You work for a gang,
you have to work.

14:23.181 --> 14:25.552
Wilson just dealt enough
to keep himself supplied.

14:25.552 --> 14:27.441
This is your friend who was murdered.

14:27.441 --> 14:31.061
Like you care about Wilson.
This is about them tourists, right?

14:31.061 --> 14:34.450
What do you think?
I'm from Brooklyn too.

14:34.981 --> 14:36.981
Anything you can give us.

14:40.089 --> 14:42.495
I don't know
what he was doing in Red Hook.

14:43.272 --> 14:44.974
Look, I... I swear.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.580
Wilson was a ghetto bird.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.271
That dude was never more
than a shout from his apartment.

14:51.001 --> 14:52.562
Bed-stuy.

14:54.740 --> 14:56.752
They make a swell couple.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.500
Her husband is not too thrilled.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.185
But she does alibi Keyshawn
for the night of the murder.

15:03.586 --> 15:07.800
It turns out they had a...
six-hour emergency session that night.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.873
Thank you.

15:12.843 --> 15:14.463
Ballistics.

15:14.463 --> 15:16.482
The .9 millimeter used to kill Crawford,

15:16.482 --> 15:20.321
it's a match for a gun
that's supposed to be in NYPD evidence.

15:40.451 --> 15:42.216
Am I making progress?

15:42.991 --> 15:45.264
I talked to the chief of D's.

15:45.264 --> 15:47.208
They're gonna take a look at the club.

15:49.693 --> 15:52.587
Testarossa, he's up from Philly,

15:52.587 --> 15:55.046
he looks like he's taking over
the operation.

15:55.046 --> 15:57.543
What about the guy
who gave you the .45?

15:57.543 --> 15:59.716
He's a suspended cop.

16:00.357 --> 16:03.794
His name is Mike Stoat.
Looks like he's, you know, working it,

16:03.794 --> 16:05.819
waiting to be reinstated.

16:05.819 --> 16:07.593
I doubt that'll happen.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.452
The gun Stoat gave you is clean.

16:10.452 --> 16:13.445
But some of the people at the property
clerk's office may not be.

16:13.445 --> 16:16.273
That's where the gun that killed
the tourists came from.

16:16.885 --> 16:18.847
Chief wants you undercover for this.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.165
Wh... what... how long?

16:20.165 --> 16:22.177
You know the drill.
You can't drink.

16:22.177 --> 16:23.594
Look, I can't do that.

16:23.594 --> 16:25.370
No trace of drugs.

16:28.392 --> 16:29.922
It's your call.

16:30.333 --> 16:34.144
But wh... why can't he get
someone from OCCB or IA?

16:34.144 --> 16:35.716
Why can't he get someone from SNEU?

16:35.716 --> 16:37.852
I went through
the whole alphabet with him.

16:37.852 --> 16:41.005
He says you're already inside.
He wants you.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.212
Yeah, he's hoping I'll get myself killed.

16:44.808 --> 16:46.379
The thought occurred to me.

16:48.738 --> 16:50.262
The way this thing fell into my lap,

16:50.262 --> 16:55.364
you know, I'm thinking that this guy Stoat
could be working for the Chief.

16:55.364 --> 16:57.549
Now you're being paranoid, Detective.

16:59.909 --> 17:02.555
Look, you're within your rights
to walk away.

17:03.537 --> 17:06.143
Yeah, if I do, they keep me
in purgatory forever.

17:09.698 --> 17:11.452
Watch yourself out there.

17:13.854 --> 17:15.339
Yes, Captain.

17:23.097 --> 17:24.964
Just get me back.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.770
We hear you're the guy to talk to
about getting some quality product.

17:53.036 --> 17:55.243
Yeah? Who told you that?

17:55.243 --> 17:57.201
Benedetti from Bay Ridge.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.429
These guys bothering you, boss?

17:59.429 --> 18:00.933
It's under control.

18:02.923 --> 18:04.595
We don't deal drugs here.

18:05.035 --> 18:06.199
It's a clean club.

18:06.199 --> 18:08.182
Who said anything about drugs?

18:09.768 --> 18:11.372
What are you doing, cowboy?

18:17.863 --> 18:20.856
You wanna talk into the mic, boss?

18:21.813 --> 18:24.324
Maybe I should show you
two cops to the door.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.709
How'd you know?

18:32.999 --> 18:38.066
Uh, you know, they wear their shirts loose
so they can hide their gun in the waistband.

18:38.066 --> 18:40.835
And the guy with the short hair,
he's toying with his cell phone.

18:42.513 --> 18:46.059
- Hey, Mike where were you?
- Busy counting your money.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.468
Take one for yourself.

18:54.922 --> 18:56.250
It's okay. I'm on duty.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.418
No, it's... it's okay.
I'll... I'll get someone to cover you.

18:58.418 --> 19:01.291
You go ahead. Live a little.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.297
Bobby.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.164
What are you doing here?

19:38.801 --> 19:42.269
I left you two messages.
You never called me back.

19:42.269 --> 19:43.672
Yeah, I've been busy.

19:44.538 --> 19:45.859
Doing what?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.331
Just sorting things out.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.263
So, how you doing?

19:52.263 --> 19:56.604
Well, I caught those tourists
who were murdered in Red Hook.

19:56.604 --> 19:58.083
I gotta run.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.233
I'll give you a call, okay?

20:12.370 --> 20:14.005
Old partner, meet new partner.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.092
Lois Melago, Bobby Goren.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.513
How's life at the six-four?

20:19.513 --> 20:23.072
The usual.
Gumdrops and roses.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.651
Melago, we got an assault in progress.

20:25.651 --> 20:27.287
Keep breathing.

20:28.636 --> 20:30.927
- I gotta chase that.
- You do that.

20:34.379 --> 20:37.198
What the hell was that? I thought you said
nobody's gonna know anything about this.

20:37.198 --> 20:39.146
No, chill out.
She's on our side.

20:40.738 --> 20:42.759
We're doing something
a little different today.

20:43.689 --> 20:45.547
We gotta find this lowlife.

20:46.017 --> 20:48.389
Eddie Jones.
Drug possession.

20:48.389 --> 20:51.209
Criminal sale of controlled substance.
Assault.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.782
I didn't think you'd have a problem
taking him off the street.

20:54.059 --> 20:55.137
What'd he do?

20:55.137 --> 20:56.844
He owes a friend some money.

20:57.859 --> 21:00.195
- A friend.
- Yeah.

21:02.165 --> 21:04.269
Mike, I gotta tell you,
before I got suspended,

21:04.269 --> 21:06.758
- Testarossa was on the radar.
- Good.

21:06.758 --> 21:08.238
He should be.

21:08.665 --> 21:10.778
And that doesn't worry you.

21:10.778 --> 21:16.889
Look... if the department ever got wind of this,

21:17.636 --> 21:19.296
you would be tainted.

21:19.296 --> 21:20.783
What am I doing here, Bobby, huh?

21:20.783 --> 21:22.396
I'm working the door at a club.

21:22.396 --> 21:24.058
I'm doing surveillance.
I'm doing security.

21:24.058 --> 21:28.526
Hell, if I had my shield back,
I'd bust the guy myself, you know?

21:29.110 --> 21:30.647
I'm not joking, Mike.

21:30.647 --> 21:32.320
What do you suggest that I do?

21:32.940 --> 21:35.942
Should I go down to Starbucks,
see if they're hiring?

21:39.313 --> 21:41.934
You want your shield back.
I get that.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.976
I'm saying, the department,

21:44.976 --> 21:48.598
they find out about any of this,
they're not gonna look the other way.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.662
Look, we're both taking
a big leap of faith here.

21:53.147 --> 21:56.067
Neither one of us
is gonna rat the other one out.

21:57.906 --> 22:00.684
You got my back, Bobby, right?

22:03.509 --> 22:04.767
Sure I do.

22:04.767 --> 22:07.361
Good. Lighten up, huh?

22:20.964 --> 22:23.042
It's a little light, isn't it?

22:24.669 --> 22:25.897
Where's the gun?

22:25.897 --> 22:28.424
You give me the case number,
I look for the file.

22:28.424 --> 22:29.939
Beyond that, I can't help you.

22:29.939 --> 22:34.022
Look, IA came in yesterday
to talk to your boss.

22:34.894 --> 22:37.253
You wanna deal with them or us?

22:43.519 --> 22:45.479
Rodriguez, A.

22:45.479 --> 22:48.093
Retired to Florida six months ago.

22:48.093 --> 22:50.200
Taggert, Ed.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.274
Transferred to sex crimes.

22:53.274 --> 22:56.929
You going through the officers with access
to the property clerk's office?

22:56.929 --> 22:58.118
It's a long list.

22:58.118 --> 23:00.047
Anybody from the six-four?

23:00.047 --> 23:01.977
- Three.
- Start with them.

23:01.977 --> 23:03.875
Something you wanna share?

23:03.875 --> 23:05.510
Just call it a hunch.

23:09.078 --> 23:10.583
Lois Melago.

23:10.583 --> 23:15.781
Nine years on the force before she was
promoted to detective and assigned to vice.

23:15.781 --> 23:17.968
- Where is she now?
- That's the interesting thing.

23:17.968 --> 23:21.693
She was suspended for a DUI.
And for trying to cover it up.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.945
Department bounced her
to the property clerk office,

23:23.945 --> 23:25.239
then back to uniform.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.111
She's working patrol, the six-four.

23:27.111 --> 23:29.841
Her partner was also suspended.
Drug charge.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.911
He's still out. Mike Stoat.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.800
Sounds like someone
with something to lose.

23:36.691 --> 23:39.305
The only thing worse than ticket duty
is traffic control.

23:39.305 --> 23:42.547
Detective Eames, Detective Daniels.
Major case.

23:43.029 --> 23:44.692
I know who you are.

23:45.694 --> 23:48.168
We were in the same graduating class.

23:48.833 --> 23:51.432
You used to be Lois Cabrera.

23:51.432 --> 23:53.216
I should stay that way.

23:55.124 --> 23:57.815
- What were there, 50 of us?
- Uh-huh.

23:57.815 --> 24:00.275
And 590 men.

24:00.275 --> 24:02.719
And here I am, still proving myself.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.825
Well, we're hoping you might help us out.

24:06.474 --> 24:09.523
You worked property clerk's last winter?

24:09.523 --> 24:11.243
Yeah, and?

24:11.243 --> 24:13.133
A .9-mil is missing.

24:13.133 --> 24:17.078
Tell me about it.
That place is barely-controlled chaos.

24:17.078 --> 24:19.082
It's amazing anything's ever found.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.376
This gun was found.

24:20.376 --> 24:23.107
By someone who took it
out of a sealed evidence bag.

24:23.772 --> 24:26.110
What are you saying?
You think I took it?

24:26.110 --> 24:28.264
I'd just come off suspension.

24:28.264 --> 24:29.450
We're not saying you took it.

24:29.450 --> 24:32.393
I didn't even have access to that kind
of stuff. Do your homework.

24:33.296 --> 24:36.918
I was working at the sign-in, checking IDs.

24:36.918 --> 24:39.136
So who did have access?

24:39.136 --> 24:40.677
I don't recall.

24:40.677 --> 24:41.765
Try harder.

24:41.765 --> 24:43.201
We're done here.

24:44.415 --> 24:46.399
What about your ex-partner?

24:47.928 --> 24:49.554
What about yours?

24:49.924 --> 24:51.382
What does that mean?

24:52.766 --> 24:55.217
Come on, man, He's my partner.

24:55.217 --> 24:56.783
I have his back.

24:56.783 --> 24:58.989
Well, you better hope he has yours.

25:05.609 --> 25:07.610
You take the front, I'll take the back.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.161
Hey, hey, come here.
Come here.

25:30.673 --> 25:32.403
I wasn't running, man.

25:32.943 --> 25:34.178
Hey, hey, hey, Mike, Mike, Mike.
Come on, come on.

25:34.178 --> 25:35.376
Get off me.

25:35.699 --> 25:38.883
Hey, there's neighbors all around, man,
come on, come on.

25:40.735 --> 25:43.737
That's all you got. Huh?
You call yourself a crook?

25:46.011 --> 25:47.194
Get off me.

25:59.322 --> 26:00.781
Here's your money, Boss.

26:03.150 --> 26:05.114
Stoat, I need you to stick around.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.537
Yeah, I would, but...
I gotta take care of something.

26:08.537 --> 26:09.683
Okay.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.056
So the cowboy stays.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.128
Whatever you want, Boss.

26:22.511 --> 26:24.308
I heard you're looking for me.

26:24.907 --> 26:26.379
Here I am.

26:26.904 --> 26:29.852
Get your feet off my partner's desk.

26:36.477 --> 26:38.412
- Melago called you?
- Yeah.

26:38.412 --> 26:41.097
She said there's a .9-mil
missing from evidence.

26:41.097 --> 26:43.455
I don't want to waste any time.

26:43.455 --> 26:47.447
I'll tell you right here and right now,
I had nothing to do with it.

26:47.447 --> 26:50.152
That's funny. That's the same thing
your partner said.

26:50.999 --> 26:54.957
So either you're both telling the truth,
or you're both going down.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.758
What's with the witch hunt?

26:56.758 --> 27:00.272
Turns out that gun
was used to kill those tourists.

27:00.830 --> 27:02.781
In your partner's precinct.

27:02.781 --> 27:05.393
Yeah, hers and a hundred other cops'.

27:05.393 --> 27:07.775
And I don't think any of them
is gonna put a gun back out

27:07.775 --> 27:09.940
on the same streets they're working.

27:11.479 --> 27:13.611
I hope to God you're right.

27:21.380 --> 27:22.591
We good to go?

27:36.184 --> 27:37.390
My money?

27:48.135 --> 27:49.328
That's it.

27:50.548 --> 27:52.231
Take the stuff. Get lost.

28:04.185 --> 28:06.379
- We done here?
- Not yet.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.039
I gotta do a good deed.

28:17.306 --> 28:18.973
Yeah, he just left.

28:20.062 --> 28:24.500
Yeah, he's driving a white SUV,
heading east on Commerce.

28:28.462 --> 28:30.141
Kill or be killed.

28:41.536 --> 28:44.346
Hands where we can see them,
or I'll blow your head off.

28:46.702 --> 28:50.637
Hector Santana, 24, from Williamsburg,
arrested last night

28:50.637 --> 28:54.652
with four ounces by two uniforms
doing a routine traffic stop.

28:54.652 --> 28:57.049
- Hinkamp and Melago.
- Melago.

28:57.049 --> 28:59.076
Her captain calls her
the queen of arrests.

28:59.076 --> 29:00.882
Her attempt to get
her Detective shield back.

29:00.882 --> 29:03.237
Anyway, it's Santana's third strike.

29:03.237 --> 29:04.693
So what's he selling?

29:04.693 --> 29:06.890
Claims to have information on the tourists.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.539
Good luck to him on that.

29:08.539 --> 29:11.654
Waited for his lawyer.
She's in there with him now.

29:12.336 --> 29:16.544
So we have your word you'll speak
to the DA on Mr. Santana's behalf?

29:16.544 --> 29:18.360
Depends how helpful he is.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.550
Start helping, Hector.

29:21.280 --> 29:25.173
Word in Red Hook is someone in
Testarossa's crew clipped the English couple.

29:25.173 --> 29:27.487
But the gun had another body on it.

29:27.487 --> 29:28.854
Keep going.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.284
Do I get protection?

29:30.284 --> 29:31.823
Not until you give us a name.

29:31.823 --> 29:33.626
And get myself whacked?

29:33.626 --> 29:35.763
Or go to prison for life.

29:35.763 --> 29:37.121
Your call.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.133
Life in prison for ten lousy ounces.

29:42.377 --> 29:43.598
What did you say?

29:43.598 --> 29:44.845
Ten ounces.

29:44.845 --> 29:47.164
One last deal.
I was gonna get out.

29:48.338 --> 29:50.181
- You had ten ounces?
- Yeah, all right?

29:50.181 --> 29:52.150
I bought them from Testarossa.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.641
11 grand.

29:53.844 --> 29:55.715
I'll bet he tipped off the cops.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.656
There was no reason
for them to pull me over.

29:59.656 --> 30:02.866
I don't got no broken taillight.
I didn't run no light.

30:03.397 --> 30:07.150
You know, the arresting officers
logged four ounces.

30:08.261 --> 30:09.859
Is that what they did?

30:11.552 --> 30:13.368
Well, that's nothing new.

30:13.368 --> 30:16.140
Well, neither is accusing cops
of stealing drugs.

30:16.140 --> 30:19.941
No, no, no, forget I said that.
I don't want any more trouble.

30:20.491 --> 30:22.727
Tell us more about the cops
who pulled you over.

30:22.727 --> 30:25.310
And you think these two
were tipped off by Testarossa?

30:25.310 --> 30:26.435
I don't know about them.

30:26.435 --> 30:28.879
All I hear, he's got two ex-cops
on his payroll.

30:28.879 --> 30:30.586
Oh, you'll say anything now.

30:30.586 --> 30:33.619
No really.
Two big white dudes.

30:34.072 --> 30:36.310
Me missing six ounces?

30:36.310 --> 30:38.898
I bet they flipped it back to Testarossa.

30:40.787 --> 30:43.867
I know some of the guys in the six-four.
It's a clean house.

30:43.867 --> 30:45.383
I read the arrest report.

30:45.383 --> 30:47.445
Santana was pulled over
for a broken taillight.

30:47.445 --> 30:48.609
Ever hear that before?

30:48.609 --> 30:49.818
You're saying you believe him?

30:49.818 --> 30:51.912
I'm saying it has to be investigated.

30:51.912 --> 30:55.272
Like the gun he knew about,
the one stolen from the PD.

30:55.272 --> 30:56.551
If you two aren't comfortable with this...

30:56.551 --> 30:59.323
Any reason we shouldn't be
comfortable with this?

31:01.593 --> 31:02.828
No.

31:04.627 --> 31:06.020
We're in.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.747
Okay, go convince Santana to wear a wire.

31:15.649 --> 31:17.416
We need to talk.

31:17.416 --> 31:18.609
Alone.

31:23.821 --> 31:25.959
Santana was just released.

31:26.513 --> 31:28.815
- What?
- About an hour ago.

31:28.815 --> 31:31.264
He got bail?
On a drug felony?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.480
A hundred thousand.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.361
And he posted it?
Uh-huh. No way.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.051
Look, all I know is, he's out.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.591
Hector, Hector, wake up.

31:44.591 --> 31:46.841
Wake up, there's someone
in the apartment.

31:52.899 --> 31:54.781
Whassup, whassup, man?

31:54.781 --> 31:56.929
Come on, we're gonna get you dressed,
we're gonna take you for a ride.

31:56.929 --> 31:58.543
Put your clothes on, Chico.

32:09.456 --> 32:10.828
All right, he's clean.

32:11.522 --> 32:12.826
Sit down.

32:14.562 --> 32:16.429
Did you cut a deal with the cops?

32:16.429 --> 32:17.575
Me?

32:17.922 --> 32:19.164
These are your guys.

32:19.164 --> 32:21.678
I'm two blocks away,
I get pulled over.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.263
Did you?

32:28.263 --> 32:30.780
Well, then that should have taught you
to keep your mouth shut.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.826
I didn't say nothing to nobody.

32:33.468 --> 32:35.902
The DA bailed you out.
Is that it?

32:40.447 --> 32:42.266
Did you make a deal with the cops?

32:42.266 --> 32:44.415
I didn't say nothing to nobody.

32:46.712 --> 32:48.148
You think I'm stupid?

32:48.148 --> 32:51.347
Legal aid said they didn't have
probable cause to stop me.

32:53.127 --> 32:55.771
Hey. His lighter.

32:56.820 --> 32:58.305
He's wired.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.359
You said he was clean.

33:05.448 --> 33:06.726
Yeah.

33:08.683 --> 33:10.293
I missed it.

33:12.484 --> 33:13.900
Oh, okay.

33:17.976 --> 33:19.473
Then he's your problem.

33:20.494 --> 33:22.149
You take care of him.

33:25.050 --> 33:27.314
- What, you mean now?
- Yeah, now.

33:27.624 --> 33:29.023
Here?

33:34.047 --> 33:35.405
Right here.

33:52.881 --> 33:53.711
Get up.

33:53.711 --> 33:56.238
Please, man, please,
I didn't do nothing. / Shut up.

33:57.196 --> 33:59.549
No, please, please, you gotta trust me.

33:59.549 --> 34:01.524
- Shut up.
- I didn't say nothing to nobody.

34:09.554 --> 34:10.993
Down on the ground.
Down on the ground.

34:10.993 --> 34:12.222
Down on the ground.

34:14.031 --> 34:15.505
Down on the ground.

34:25.121 --> 34:27.108
How'd you miss that wire, Bobby?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.701
Screwed up.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.842
Okay.

34:47.232 --> 34:49.463
All right. Don't worry about it.

34:49.867 --> 34:52.024
We were just working security.

34:52.024 --> 34:54.428
Okay, Testarossa went off on the guy.

34:54.864 --> 34:58.583
You grabbed the gun
to get him to stop. Okay?

34:58.861 --> 35:02.345
All right. Okay, thanks. Yeah.

35:03.217 --> 35:04.428
Stoat.

35:23.741 --> 35:25.649
Testarossa's lawyered up.

35:27.163 --> 35:29.184
What about Melago?

35:29.184 --> 35:30.836
What's going on here?

35:32.650 --> 35:34.342
Is now okay?

35:35.181 --> 35:37.491
You're undercover, you don't tell me?

35:37.491 --> 35:39.886
Those were my orders.
Came from the top.

35:41.869 --> 35:43.750
I can't believe this.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.667
It was a need-to-know case.
I'm sorry.

35:49.964 --> 35:53.321
Eames, Melago is in holding downtown.

35:53.321 --> 35:56.780
You have a history with her.
See if she'll deal.

36:10.575 --> 36:12.346
You don't have to explain anything to me.

36:12.346 --> 36:15.630
I know all about working
in the boys' club. / Uh-huh.

36:15.989 --> 36:18.149
You're a Major Case detective.

36:18.149 --> 36:20.929
I got busted back to the bag
writing parking tickets

36:20.929 --> 36:23.556
for teenagers driving
nicer cars than me.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.218
You and I have nothing in common.

36:25.218 --> 36:27.676
You were in vice.
You were on your way up.

36:27.676 --> 36:30.471
You never had a drink
and got behind the wheel, Detective?

36:31.443 --> 36:34.607
You're gonna tell me that I deserve
to have my rank taken away from me

36:34.607 --> 36:38.011
for a glass and a half of wine
at my cousin's baby shower?

36:38.465 --> 36:41.790
I was .06. Borderline.

36:42.196 --> 36:44.869
So spare me
the sister/friend routine, okay?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.459
Suit yourself.

36:48.633 --> 36:51.802
Is that why you hooked up with Stoat,
so you could stick it to the PD?

36:51.802 --> 36:54.940
No. / He gives you the heads up
when a deal goes down.

36:54.940 --> 36:57.368
You arrest the dealer,
keep some of the stash.

36:57.368 --> 36:58.295
What?

36:58.295 --> 37:01.474
Santana told us
he had ten ounces on him.

37:01.474 --> 37:03.254
You vouchered four.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.847
Wanna explain the new math, Melago?

37:05.847 --> 37:09.393
You believe a lying, piece of crap drug dealer
over one of your own?

37:09.393 --> 37:11.779
What happened to the other six ounces?

37:12.425 --> 37:13.854
What do you do, sell them?

37:13.854 --> 37:15.777
I've taken more dealers off the street...

37:15.777 --> 37:19.712
Please. How much does Testarossa pay
you for being in his pocket?

37:19.712 --> 37:21.655
How much does he pay your partner?

37:23.138 --> 37:24.844
I don't know about that.

37:24.844 --> 37:27.257
But I do know you need
to get in front of this.

37:27.257 --> 37:28.734
I'm a good cop.

37:28.734 --> 37:30.395
You're a lousy cop.

37:30.395 --> 37:32.219
You're on Testarossa's payroll.

37:32.219 --> 37:35.941
One of his crew killed Crawford
and those tourists.

37:35.941 --> 37:38.374
You and I both know
that makes you an accomplice.

37:38.374 --> 37:40.288
No... don't put that on me.

37:40.288 --> 37:44.330
How did Testarossa get a gun
that was in the property clerk's office?

37:44.904 --> 37:48.830
I'm not throwing myself on the sword
for some warm tea and pretzels.

37:49.265 --> 37:50.921
I want a lawyer.

37:55.232 --> 37:58.265
IAD is in the process of
requiring her tolls and LUDs.

37:58.265 --> 38:01.126
Once they get things more concrete,
she might crack.

38:01.126 --> 38:02.543
Where is Goren?

38:02.543 --> 38:05.363
The rookie riding with Melago just flipped.

38:05.363 --> 38:08.722
He said Melago tipped him off the drug bust
and she handled the evidence,

38:08.722 --> 38:10.764
kept the other six ounces.

38:13.257 --> 38:16.320
Nice work. For both of you.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.862
And Eames, your partner is
about to go in on Stoat.

38:22.786 --> 38:24.389
You shook my hand.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.183
You told me you had my back.
You lied to me.

38:27.183 --> 38:29.124
Yeah, I'm a cop.

38:29.124 --> 38:31.343
I'm allowed to lie to criminals.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.962
You cooperate against Testarossa,

38:37.962 --> 38:40.418
you're not gonna see a lot of jail time.

38:41.563 --> 38:43.143
I'm not a rat.

38:44.165 --> 38:46.532
He killed innocent people in cold blood.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.959
Come on, I haven't seen
any innocent people for a long time.

38:49.959 --> 38:53.604
Yeah, but you've seen him run drugs.
You're gonna protect a guy like that?

38:54.051 --> 38:55.493
Come on, Bobby.

38:55.944 --> 38:58.054
Are you gonna do this to one of your own?

38:58.793 --> 39:00.958
Yeah, well, that's the thing, Mike.

39:01.953 --> 39:03.753
I'm nothing like you.

39:09.909 --> 39:12.073
Now what happened
to the six ounces of coke

39:12.073 --> 39:14.789
that went missing in the Santana deal?

39:14.789 --> 39:16.453
You worked narcotics, right?

39:16.453 --> 39:20.382
What, you never paid informants with drugs
to try to land a bigger fish?

39:20.944 --> 39:22.182
No.

39:22.947 --> 39:24.458
Have you?

39:33.724 --> 39:38.651
Come on. Who killed Wilson Crawford?

39:38.651 --> 39:41.221
Come on. A drug dealer?

39:42.449 --> 39:45.248
You know in some circles
they applaud that?

39:46.228 --> 39:47.524
Okay.

39:51.567 --> 39:53.916
What are you getting for setting me up?

39:53.916 --> 39:55.706
Are you getting your shield back?

39:58.042 --> 40:00.756
Is that your 30 pieces of silver, Bobby?

40:04.651 --> 40:06.323
What about the Bennetts?

40:07.853 --> 40:12.335
Innocent bystanders killed
with a gun from NYPD evidence.

40:13.433 --> 40:16.167
Are you gonna applaud that too?

40:16.167 --> 40:17.873
Are you that far gone?

40:32.439 --> 40:34.196
He's not giving anyone up.

40:35.318 --> 40:39.531
Whether they cooperate or not.
Stoat and Melago are going away.

40:39.531 --> 40:42.213
Feds are making this a RICO.

40:48.058 --> 40:50.831
Chief of D's.
Yeah, boss.

40:52.470 --> 40:53.691
Eames.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.676
I'm sorry.

40:58.001 --> 40:59.885
That's all you have to say to me?

40:59.885 --> 41:02.233
I could've blown your head off
back there.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.150
Eight years I've had your back,

41:04.150 --> 41:06.531
and I don't even get the courtesy
of a phone call.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.058
I was trying to protect you.

41:08.058 --> 41:09.011
Since when?

41:09.011 --> 41:11.361
- And there were rules that...
- Rules?

41:12.056 --> 41:13.633
You've got to be kidding me.

41:13.633 --> 41:16.602
You managed to get word
to the Captain.

41:16.602 --> 41:19.405
You contacted the chief of D's.
But just not your partner?

41:19.405 --> 41:21.313
This is my only way back.

41:22.104 --> 41:25.694
I mean, how else am I gonna get my shield?
You're not getting it.

41:25.694 --> 41:27.962
I get it. I get it.

41:27.962 --> 41:31.824
You're the genius,
and I just carry your water, right?

41:31.824 --> 41:36.216
You have any idea how many times
I've lied for you, covered your ass?

41:36.216 --> 41:37.619
I was in a deep hole here.

41:37.619 --> 41:39.066
And whose fault was that?

41:39.066 --> 41:41.562
All your wounds are self-inflicted.

41:45.054 --> 41:47.642
I know, I tried not to drag you
into this one.

41:47.642 --> 41:50.682
And what would you have done
if I hadn't burst through that door?

41:51.984 --> 41:53.871
If it wasn't me,

41:54.167 --> 41:55.789
you'd be dead.

42:04.798 --> 42:06.738
I didn't look for this.

42:07.844 --> 42:10.274
You could've fooled me, Detective.

42:10.274 --> 42:12.114
I hope it was worth it.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.042
Melago took a plea deal.

42:22.042 --> 42:25.207
She linked the gun to Testarossa
and Testarossa to the murders.

42:25.207 --> 42:28.932
Stoat still hasn't budged,
but we'll see how long that lasts.

42:28.932 --> 42:30.454
Good work, Detectives.

42:30.706 --> 42:31.762
So does this...

42:31.762 --> 42:36.377
Um, I'm making the assumption
Detective Goren will be back with us ASAP.

42:42.543 --> 42:44.359
Shield and the gun, Detective.

42:45.802 --> 42:47.108
Congratulations.

42:52.678 --> 42:55.848
- A pleasure, Detective.
- Same here, Daniels. Good night.

43:12.491 --> 43:14.448
So I'll see you in the morning.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.204
Yup.
