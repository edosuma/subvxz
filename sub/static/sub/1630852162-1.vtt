00:18.268 --> 00:20.311
I'm entering cargo bay one now.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.028
The fuel cells
are still generating minimum power.

00:31.656 --> 00:35.452
-<i>Your heart rate's elevated.</i>
-Hey! Don't spy on my vitals.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.456
<i>Just keep an eye on our damaged engine</i>
<i>and those asteroids.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.168
Do you think he's still alive?

00:43.668 --> 00:45.378
It's been 20 years.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.799
The lander's missing.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.261
In an emergency, it would've launched
with the crew in their cryotubes.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.056
Maybe I can find where they went.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.895
Oh…

01:07.692 --> 01:08.610
Oh…

01:23.917 --> 01:26.169
Okay.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.756
The radar's trying to pinpoint a signal
from the Fortuna lander.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.096
Hello?

01:39.557 --> 01:42.018
Judy, your heart rate's going crazy.
Is someone there?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.855
Faith Carson, payload specialist.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.066
Deceased.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.902
Cause of death
I'll have to determine later.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.197
Please be careful.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.241
I'm fine.

02:00.870 --> 02:05.208
I wanna know what happened here
and why the crew went missing.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.424
There's the crew
in their cryotubes.

02:14.008 --> 02:17.053
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Starboard engine A failure.</i>

02:17.137 --> 02:20.974
Starboard thruster A went offline. I think
it's leaking fuel into the main igniter.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.976


02:25.562 --> 02:27.897
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Conjunction imminent.</i>

02:28.606 --> 02:30.900
<i>Warning. Conjunction imminent.</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:33.278
There's an extra-large asteroid
coming towards us.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.072
-One thing at a time.
-More than one thing is happening.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.032
<i>Maybe it's time to come back now.</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:40.326
I'm almost there.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.745
Almost there.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.747
<i>Safety systems initiated.</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:46.249
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:49.210
<i>-Prepare for landing.</i>
-Judy's not on the ship! Turn it off!

02:49.294 --> 02:52.255
<i>-Landing sequence initiates in 90 seconds.</i>
-I'm locked out.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.464
Ninety seconds?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.885
Judy, the computer took over.
We're landing now.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.476
I'm on my way.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.818
Vijay, prepare everyone for landing.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.696
-Everyone needs to buckle up! Buckle up!
-Let's go! Come on!

03:16.779 --> 03:18.406
Okay. Get strapped in.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.575
You good? Here, here. Okay.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.031
-Smith!
-Gotcha.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.407
Smith?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.499
What are you doing here?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.001
How did you even get on this ship?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.337
I go where I'm needed.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.048
Please tell me I'm hearing things.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.172


05:25.450 --> 05:27.285
You're supposed to be on watch.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.686
Ugh!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.334
Captain's log, day 349.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.628
Well, Dad, we're still here.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.214
Wherever here is.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.008
<i>The rest of the planet</i>
<i>died a long time ago.</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:08.344
<i>How or from what, we still don't know,</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:11.055
<i>but the Jupiter's computer</i>
<i>found a spot deep in the valley</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:15.351
<i>where life was able to survive,</i>
<i>and so far, so have we.</i>

07:16.602 --> 07:19.188
<i>The corn yield is up 3% from last week.</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:21.482
<i>The solar arrays have been optimized.</i>

07:21.566 --> 07:23.568
<i>Batteries are back to full charge.</i>

07:23.651 --> 07:26.571
<i>No major injuries or illnesses to report.</i>

07:27.488 --> 07:28.948
<i>We even have a school now.</i>

07:29.031 --> 07:31.659
<i>-Doctor, or should I say, Madame Smith…</i>
<i>-Tu vois…</i>

07:31.742 --> 07:33.870
<i>…seems to have found</i>
<i>her true calling.</i>

07:33.953 --> 07:35.121
<i>-Vous voyez.</i>
-<i>Vous voyez.</i>

07:35.204 --> 07:39.417
<i>The threat from falling meteors</i>
<i>is ongoing, so we stay vigilant,</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:41.878
<i>monitoring the skies day and night.</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:44.797
<i>So far, none have reached us</i>
<i>down here in the valley.</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:46.841
<i>For us, that counts as good luck,</i>

07:46.924 --> 07:50.011
<i>but none of it stops anyone</i>
<i>from missing their parents</i>

07:50.094 --> 07:53.681
<i>or wondering if we're even</i>
<i>gonna make it to Alpha Centauri.</i>

07:55.558 --> 07:59.187
<i>Turns out recasting a damaged engine</i>
<i>out of raw titanium ore</i>

07:59.270 --> 08:00.771
<i>doesn't go very fast.</i>

08:01.522 --> 08:03.191
<i>We've switched to three-hour shifts,</i>

08:03.274 --> 08:07.570
<i>but to date, we've only managed to refine</i>
<i>72% of the material Will says we need</i>

08:07.653 --> 08:09.530
<i>to make the Jupiter flight-worthy.</i>

08:11.199 --> 08:13.534
<i>I'm sure he's working as fast as he can.</i>

08:13.618 --> 08:16.537
<i>It's just going a lot slower</i>
<i>than anyone wants.</i>

08:16.621 --> 08:20.333
<i>It was supposed to only take a few weeks,</i>
<i>and it's turned into a year.</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.461
<i>Will seems to be taking it personally.</i>

08:24.003 --> 08:27.006
<i>He doesn't look like he's had</i>
<i>a good night's sleep in months.</i>

08:27.507 --> 08:29.467
<i>He doesn't talk to me about it.</i>

08:29.550 --> 08:32.136
<i>We don't really talk much</i>
<i>about anything lately.</i>

08:32.637 --> 08:34.514
<i>It seems like none of us do.</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:39.602
<i>Penny seems distant, distracted.</i>

08:40.102 --> 08:43.856
<i>I'd say it's just the boys,</i>
<i>but I know it's more.</i>

08:43.940 --> 08:45.775
<i>She's mad at me for something.</i>

08:46.359 --> 08:47.693
<i>I wish I could fix it,</i>

08:47.777 --> 08:51.030
<i>but my responsibilities</i>
<i>don't give me much family time.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:54.909
<i>Without you or Mom,</i>
<i>I think we're all a bit lost.</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:58.663
<i>Even the robot,</i>
<i>he genuinely wants to be helpful,</i>

08:58.746 --> 09:02.208
<i>but he seems to be searching</i>
<i>for what his purpose is here.</i>

09:04.961 --> 09:08.714
<i>I guess, in a way, I am too.</i>

09:23.563 --> 09:27.275
There's no wind this morning. Watch,
this one's gonna make it to the top.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.157
Family, Judy Robinson.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.954
Look, I'm trying to contact the whole
Fortuna crew, not just Grant Kelly.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.373
Family.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.085
Don't you ever wonder where you came from?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.984
<i>The most recent attempt</i>
<i>to contact the missing lander</i>

10:10.067 --> 10:12.486
<i>was as unsuccessful as all the rest.</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:18.367
I don't know when you're gonna listen
to these reports, Dad. I hope it's soon.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.455
<i>Mission report.</i>

10:22.538 --> 10:24.624
<i>John Robinson, salvage team leader.</i>

10:27.627 --> 10:30.254
<i>As always,</i>
<i>robot patrols are hard to predict.</i>

10:33.049 --> 10:34.842
<i>So far, they don't know we're here.</i>

10:35.968 --> 10:38.387
<i>We've located more Resolute wreckage.</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:40.181
<i>Looks like a piece of H deck.</i>

10:41.682 --> 10:44.310
<i>Odds are good</i>
<i>we'll find the last supplies we need.</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:49.940
<i>As tough as it is down here, at least</i>
<i>it keeps our minds off what we've lost.</i>

10:53.694 --> 10:56.697
Okay. We have two hours
until the lightning hits,

10:56.781 --> 10:58.324
then we have to be airborne<i>,</i>

10:58.407 --> 11:01.160
unless you feel like spending
another 23 days down here.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.497
Hey, stick to the list.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.416
If we find everything that's on it,
this will be our last trip.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
And remember, keep your ponchos on.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.379
They'll scatter your bio-signs.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.507
Whatever you've got that's electronic,
keep it switched off.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.343
It's like smelling blood to them.
Let's get to work.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.221
-Okay.
-Copy that. Let's go this way.

11:23.766 --> 11:27.395
Beckert, grab those flashlights.
Be sure you get the batteries out first.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.833
This is my son's favorite flavor.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.890
Get down. Get down.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.559
Get down!

12:08.352 --> 12:09.895
-Beckert, no flashlights.
-I know.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.692
No! No!

12:14.775 --> 12:15.860
They're coming!

12:33.586 --> 12:37.965
So, Penny,
this book you're writing, how does it end?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.134
It's a cliffhanger.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.095
Cliffhanger? Really?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.724
Yeah, it's just a fancy way of saying
I stopped in the middle.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.602
But, you know, writing was the old me.

12:51.312 --> 12:56.108
-How is she different from the new you?
-I used to care about things too much.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.943
I guess I got that from my parents.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.991
Do you think they're okay?

13:07.119 --> 13:11.874
I don't like hypothetical questions.
I live in the moment.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.960
That's what I like about you,
Penny Robinson.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.221
Pressurizing.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.643
Heat this up
to 900 degrees Celsius for me, please.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.381
Will!

14:02.883 --> 14:04.718
Is this a bad time?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.974
Same as it always is.
What are you doing here?

14:10.057 --> 14:12.601
I was just curious what's taking so long.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.230
Well, refining titanium's
harder than teaching French.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.817
I was looking forward to living happily
on Alpha Centauri.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.361
It's not so bad here.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.449
Everyone was so excited when you said
we'd only be here a few weeks.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.495
People are less excited now.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.167
Well, bothering me
isn't gonna make things go any faster.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.712
If I can help in any way

14:39.795 --> 14:43.507
that doesn't involve standing up to
my knees in cold water, let me know.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.906
<i>Object approaching.</i>

15:15.664 --> 15:17.207
-Hurry!
-Everybody!

15:25.090 --> 15:26.216
Let's go, guys!

15:30.846 --> 15:33.307
Incoming meteor!
Everyone head to the bunker!

15:33.390 --> 15:35.643
Okay. Okay, to the bunker!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.188
Everyone get to the bunker!

15:39.271 --> 15:40.940
-Hurry up!

15:42.149 --> 15:42.983
Come on!

15:43.525 --> 15:44.735
Come on! Will!

15:50.658 --> 15:51.992
Come on, come on!

15:52.076 --> 15:53.869
-A bit faster!
-Where's Penny?

15:54.703 --> 15:55.663
Come on. Come on!

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
Where's my mom? I'm here!

16:08.008 --> 16:09.051
Okay.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.970
We're all clear.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.140
Good job. We just need
to be a bit quicker next time.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.142
-Let's keep at it.
-Good.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.437
-Back to work.
-I can help clean up.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.244
A lot of people here think you're cool.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.038
You're setting a bad example
by blowing this off.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.249
I'm not setting an example of anything.
That's your job.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.293
You're part of the crew,
same as everyone else.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.006
It burned up in the atmosphere. Okay?
It always burns up in the atmosphere.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.174
Someday it might not.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.017
Judy!

17:00.144 --> 17:02.688
You remember that thing
we were worried about a year ago?

17:02.771 --> 17:05.566
The thing we never thought would come up
because we'd be long gone?

17:07.818 --> 17:10.320
This is a simulation
of what happened earlier.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.490
See that collision
between those two giant asteroids?

17:13.574 --> 17:15.200
Now watch what happened next.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.703
-What's going on?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.915
One of those pieces
is the big meteor that just fell,

17:21.999 --> 17:24.626
but look how many other
smaller pieces came off too.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.795
And a lot of them
are still floating in orbit.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.590
It's getting exponentially
more congested up there.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.842
How long before the computer won't be able

17:31.925 --> 17:34.178
to safely navigate the ship
through this mess?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.181
At this rate, four or five days.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.808
And we'll be stuck here forever.

17:42.269 --> 17:46.065
It'll take more than four days
to complete repairs on the ship, won't it?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.817
I could do it in four hours
if I had enough titanium.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.620
I wish I could do this by myself.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.039
Do what?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.751
So, when we first got here,

18:05.834 --> 18:09.630
the Jupiter sensors picked up
a pure titanium deposit two miles up.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.550
We asked the robot to go get it,
but the rock couldn't support his weight,

18:13.634 --> 18:15.594
and I thought that was
the end of that plan,

18:15.677 --> 18:18.263
but things have changed.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.309
The good news is
we are a lot lighter than the robot is.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.728
Did you say two miles?

18:25.312 --> 18:28.148
Who here has climbed two miles?
Not even you.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.859
How much worse is falling two miles
than falling one mile?

18:31.401 --> 18:35.155
This planet's atmosphere was ripped away
by whatever cataclysm wrecked it.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.492
We were lucky to find a puddle of
atmosphere at the bottom of this canyon.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.786
As we go higher,
it'll thin out to nothing.

18:40.869 --> 18:44.623
Which is why, at this point,
we will need our space suits.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.961
We're only gonna have one shot at this.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.963
So this needs to succeed,

18:51.672 --> 18:55.634
or we can forget about
ever seeing Alpha Centauri or our parents.

18:57.761 --> 19:01.890
Okay, so everybody prep your suits,
and we will print the gear we need.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.645
Danger.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.355
Tell me about it.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.525
Help Will Robinson.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.156
I know you're always trying to help me…

19:19.032 --> 19:20.242
but you can't this time.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.452
Okay?

19:27.374 --> 19:28.292
Hey.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.920
You were quiet.
You don't have any questions?

19:32.588 --> 19:33.797
You were very thorough.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.926
We've been in some hard spots before,
but we've always made it through.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.680
Yeah, with Mom and Dad there to help us.
Who knows where they are now?

20:04.786 --> 20:05.829
-West.
-Yeah?

20:05.913 --> 20:09.374
After this supply run, do we have
everything to make the base operational?

20:09.458 --> 20:13.462
But I guarantee that the systems
will be up and running within 24 hours.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.797
Including air conditioning?
It's hot as hell.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.966
Stars are hot.
What am I supposed to do?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.385
Fortunately, they provide
photoelectric interference

20:20.469 --> 20:21.720
to hide us from the enemy.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.431
Now that we're hidden,

20:24.514 --> 20:28.268
we can finally turn our attention
to finding a way back to our children.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.021
I know not a second passes
we don't think about them.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.732
As I understand it,

20:33.815 --> 20:36.777
we need one of the robots' engines
to get us to Alpha Centauri,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.947
and that engine
can only be operated by a robot.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.743
John, can you speak
to what we're up against?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.746
Uh…

20:48.956 --> 20:50.165
They don't like us.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.376
They don't hate us.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.255
The only person they've ever seemed
to care about is my son,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.383
and, uh… he's not here.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.346
If they discover us, they'll kill us.
If we stay hidden, we'll stay alive.

21:05.472 --> 21:09.393
However, we've learned that
if we take something that belongs to them,

21:10.560 --> 21:11.687
they hit back hard.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.357
-So how do we take it without getting hit?
-I don't know.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.027
I'm not afraid to take these things on.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.072
Whatever the risk,
it's worth it to get back to my daughter.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.199
Bravery won't get us very far.

21:25.492 --> 21:29.162
I was hoping Maureen might be here
with us today, share some insight.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.417
You'll have to discuss that with her.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.422
All right, everyone.
Let's get to work.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.850
Hi, beautiful!

21:49.933 --> 21:52.519
Oh, I missed you so much!

21:52.602 --> 21:54.604
Are you getting the respect you deserve?

21:54.688 --> 21:57.441
You let me know.
I'll go to Human Resources. Yes, I will!

21:57.524 --> 21:59.901
How can you tell which one's yours?

22:01.069 --> 22:02.863
What kind of a father do you think I am?

22:06.992 --> 22:10.746
Yeah! Yeah! See you soon! I love you!

22:16.877 --> 22:20.047
Don't you have a tea party
in the officers' mess to attend?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.341
It's more of a casual get-together.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.508
Oh, how nice.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.429
Did you talk to Victor
about the shift rotation thing?

22:27.929 --> 22:29.348
He said it was my call.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.433
Okay, good. We're back to twos.

22:31.933 --> 22:35.562
Uh, not exactly. We're gonna stick
to the four-hour space walks.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.106
-What?
-We gotta keep pushing.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.401
If we bring the temperature below 90,
we're all gonna be much happier.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.445
Ava, come on.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.488
Just--

22:44.571 --> 22:46.239
I'm just doing-- I'm just…

22:48.367 --> 22:51.036
What are you looking at?
You got somethin' to say?

22:52.329 --> 22:53.830
Maureen! Hey.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.832
Nobody likes me.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.126
Nobody liked me either.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.879
I need you
to sign off on my work.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.008
No cracks in the bead. A straight joint.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.845
-Well done. For grunt work.
-I'm good at it.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.432
Well, Einstein was good at the violin.
Nobody bought his album.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.184
I'm needed here.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.647
We're deep in enemy territory,
and you think this is where you're needed?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.482
Are you gonna sign off on my work?

23:27.030 --> 23:27.989
John's back.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.661
Thanks for letting me know.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.678
J2. This is yours, right?

23:49.761 --> 23:50.595
Yeah.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.765
We're reorganizing G section
to accommodate the TCS.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.060
We need you to clear out these cabins,
or the work can't proceed.

23:59.062 --> 23:59.938
Okay.

24:14.995 --> 24:15.871
Maureen?

24:59.414 --> 25:02.167
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>
<i>I know what you wanna hear.</i>

25:02.250 --> 25:04.211
<i>I'll be as careful as I can be.</i>

25:04.294 --> 25:06.838
<i>I'll accept the unexpected.</i>

25:06.922 --> 25:10.175
<i>When things go wrong,</i>
<i>I won't stand around and complain.</i>

25:10.258 --> 25:12.469
<i>I'll assess my options and move forward…</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:14.721
<i>or, in this case, up.</i>

25:16.097 --> 25:17.390
<i>And, as always,</i>

25:17.474 --> 25:21.186
<i>I'm guided by the knowledge</i>
<i>that everything I'm doing,</i>

25:21.269 --> 25:25.690
<i>I'm doing for the well-being</i>
<i>of the 97 children in my care.</i>

26:19.202 --> 26:22.038
Judy, did you hammer in an anchor
that didn't stick?

26:22.122 --> 26:22.998
No, why?

26:34.301 --> 26:35.635
Hey, what is that?

26:38.138 --> 26:40.807
-Is it weird that I think it's kinda cute?
-No.

26:40.890 --> 26:41.808
Yeah!

26:46.563 --> 26:50.025
Let's keep moving.
We have to reach 1,500 meters before dark.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.263
Will's not the same as he was.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.309
And I'm not just talking about his haircut

27:24.392 --> 27:27.062
or the irritating fact
that he's taller than me now.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.606
He's hiding something.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.240
If you know something, tell me.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.910
For all our sakes.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.277
-You okay?

28:17.612 --> 28:19.280
Uh… Had a nightmare.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.366
Ugh. Yeah, tell me about it.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.619
This has been a nightmare for me too.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.335
Does she ever talk to you about me?

28:34.295 --> 28:37.215
Penny and I
haven't really been talking much.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.636
I miss the way
things used to be.

28:43.763 --> 28:44.681
Me too.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.566
Hey.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.194
Can I fix you somethin' to eat?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.488
"Something's" right.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.076
There are a lot of smart people here.
Still, nobody knows what's in those.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.581
-I'll take that as a no.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.127
I heard it was rough down there.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.673
It was what it was.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.802
How were things up here?

29:24.179 --> 29:25.096
Busy.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.808
We just gotta complete
those TCS coolant loops.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.187
-Yeah, about that. Um…

29:34.689 --> 29:36.816
They need us to clear out the kids' rooms.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.072
I gotta get some sleep.
I have another shift in six hours.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.326
-Skip your shift.
-I can't. There's too tight a schedule.

29:46.409 --> 29:49.245
There are things
we need to take care of right here.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.831
I'm not stopping you.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.919
Maureen, what are you doing?

29:57.086 --> 30:00.006
I'm doing what I always do,
keeping everything running.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.508
We're in this together.

30:02.842 --> 30:03.760
You're my wife.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.804
Yeah, and I used to be a mother.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.808
Look at us, John. We have nothing.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.726
You have me.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.230
Sorry.

30:32.831 --> 30:33.873
Okay.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.668
-Nice, Penny.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.462
Okay. Okay.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.756
-And right foot down on that spur.
-Okay.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.134
Oh…

30:45.218 --> 30:47.679
Okay, thanks. Oh…

30:47.762 --> 30:51.015
-You got it!
-Of course I do.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.769
-Left hand here.
-Yeah, thanks. I got it too.

31:02.902 --> 31:03.903
Here, man.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.072
You're distracting me. Stop.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.495
No!

31:13.788 --> 31:15.623
-Will!
-Will. Will! Let me down.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.000
Okay.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.753
No. No.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.298
Vijay! Vijay, are you okay?

31:26.551 --> 31:28.094
I'm fine. I--

31:28.177 --> 31:30.597
Think I might've hurt my wrist.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.057
-How does that feel?
-It's okay.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.476
-What about that?
-No, that hurts.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.771
Okay, it's starting to swell.
I think it's fractured.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.316
Let's focus on my other
perfectly non-fractured wrist.

31:41.399 --> 31:44.235
Hey, don't feel bad.
What we're doing isn't easy.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.613
Liam, can you come down here
and bring the med kit?

31:46.696 --> 31:47.739
Yeah, on my way.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.824
He's gonna bring you back to camp, okay?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.245
This is what I was worried
was gonna happen.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.382
Yeah, for sure…

32:26.861 --> 32:28.488
Will Robinson!

32:29.948 --> 32:32.575
You're not such a hero after all.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.136
Whoa!

32:52.220 --> 32:56.182
These updrafts are crazy.
Could they actually blow us away?

32:57.517 --> 32:58.434
Pretty definitely.

33:01.604 --> 33:02.939
Wow, look!

33:16.494 --> 33:18.997
It's been a while since it's been just us.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.505
Just get what we came here for, okay?

33:30.299 --> 33:31.968
Yeah.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.046
Penny, what are you looking for?

34:10.673 --> 34:11.716
What is this?

34:12.258 --> 34:15.261
That's a high-powered
radio signal receiver…

34:17.346 --> 34:18.890
because…

34:18.973 --> 34:24.353
we might be high enough to catch
a signal from the Fortuna lander, right?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.817
You're looking for Grant Kelly.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.237
I've been trying to raise the missing
Fortuna crew ever since we got here.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.239
What were you gonna do
if you got a signal?

34:35.323 --> 34:37.825
-Well, there isn't.
-Might be if we go higher up.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.290
Are you coming down with us or not?

34:44.373 --> 34:47.460
We have all the titanium.
The descent's already anchored.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.420
You're gonna leave us here two miles up?

34:49.504 --> 34:53.007
I've never been this close before.
You can't understand that?

34:53.091 --> 34:56.969
I understand you made us leave our family
and now you are looking for a new one.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.520
Hey, what's that sound?

35:05.603 --> 35:06.687
It's just wind.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.940
No. There's something else.

35:13.402 --> 35:14.529
What are those?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.366
Oh, my God!

35:30.419 --> 35:32.797
-What just happened?
-Quick, helmets on!

35:40.596 --> 35:41.597
What…

35:43.891 --> 35:45.810
Hey, be careful of the updraft.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.565
I think we have bigger problems
than the updraft.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.156
It's those bugs! They're eating the pillar
out from under us!

35:58.239 --> 36:01.492
They're like rock termites!
You still think they're cute?

36:03.452 --> 36:05.580
Okay, so how do we get down from here?

36:05.663 --> 36:06.873
We can't go down.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.457
-We have to go up.
-What?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.793
We can't leave without that titanium.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.588
Will? Seems like a geology problem.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.965
Creatures that eat rocks aren't geology.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.385
-What would Mom and Dad do?
-Well, it's just us.

36:19.468 --> 36:23.639
Come on, Mr. Magnesium. Let's make this
a story we wanna tell around a campfire.

36:33.858 --> 36:34.734
We'll fly!

36:35.651 --> 36:37.236
That's a terrible story.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.655
No. No, that's it.
We can ride the updraft, right?

36:39.739 --> 36:41.324
Yeah. Let's test it.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.283
Okay.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.918
See? It worked.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.170
Are we watching the same test?

36:54.253 --> 36:57.632
-We need to control our ascent.
-What?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.133
Okay.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.826
So, am I just supposed
to jump over the edge?

37:25.910 --> 37:29.830
No, everybody jumps over the edge
together. Hold my hand.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.673
Keep your eyes on me. I'll get us there.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.924
On three.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.928
One, two,

37:45.304 --> 37:46.514
three!

37:49.892 --> 37:50.893
Whoa!

37:55.189 --> 37:56.941
Okay! We're flying!

38:09.787 --> 38:10.913
It's working!

38:13.124 --> 38:15.251
When I say go, release. All right?

38:16.752 --> 38:17.753
Okay.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.588
Ready?

38:19.672 --> 38:21.048
And release!

38:30.391 --> 38:32.601
-Will? Will, are you all right?

38:33.227 --> 38:34.395
Hey, you all right?

38:35.396 --> 38:36.522
Yeah.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.150
Penny? Hey. Hey.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.484
-Hey, are you hurt?

38:41.360 --> 38:43.029
Are you hurt? Penny?

38:48.617 --> 38:51.245
Hey. Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.540
Oh!

39:00.296 --> 39:01.255
It's okay.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.141
It's okay.

39:13.642 --> 39:16.771
Hey, we got the titanium.
We can head back down,

39:16.854 --> 39:18.397
-All right?
-No, hold on. Wait.

39:23.444 --> 39:26.655
I grabbed this before it fell.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.534
No.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.453
I'm responsible for you two

39:32.536 --> 39:35.456
and almost a hundred other kids
back at camp.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.501
-Dad would not want--
-Dad's not here right now.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.670
Okay? I really wish he was, but he's not.

39:43.339 --> 39:47.343
And for the last year, I have been so mad

39:48.594 --> 39:51.430
because I blamed you
for being the reason that we had to leave.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.769
And I didn't realize
that you were just looking out for me.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.733
And nobody looks out for me
the way that you do.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.947
That's what family does.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.536
So go find Grant Kelly.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.041
Can you fix the engine now?

40:19.959 --> 40:20.918
Yeah.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.879
We'll keep the camp from burning down
until you get back.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.578
Here you go.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.164
Uh, take this to the forge, okay?

41:01.292 --> 41:05.629
This is acting captain's log, day 352.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.590
Um, acting cocaptain.

41:07.673 --> 41:10.551
Hey, you're ruining the recording.
I'm gonna have to start over.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.928
If you can't be accurate,
you should start over.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.681
The titanium's been acquired.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.725
Repairs to the Jupiter
can now be completed.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.394
You'd be really proud.
We did it all ourselves.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.188
Also, we flew off a cliff.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.397
-No, don't…

41:23.481 --> 41:25.107
Now I'm gonna have to erase that part.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.943
Acting Cocaptain Penny Robinson
signing off.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.703
You didn't have to make that climb,
but then you know that.

41:38.287 --> 41:42.374
-What are you talking about?
-I've cooked a few books in my day, okay?

41:42.458 --> 41:45.961
If you really wanna be an effective thief,
learn accounting,

41:46.670 --> 41:48.714
but if you wanna catch a thief…

41:52.843 --> 41:56.722
You see, there's a tremendous amount
of titanium ore that somehow disappeared.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.724
I'm annoyed I didn't catch it sooner,

41:58.807 --> 42:02.853
but after a year of babysitting,
I guess I'm losing my edge.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.775
But who would've thought
that Will Robinson

42:07.858 --> 42:12.029
would sabotage our only way
to get to Alpha Centauri?

42:13.322 --> 42:15.032
You're right about everything.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.328
It was me.

42:20.287 --> 42:23.165
What I don't understand
is why you don't wanna leave.

42:25.668 --> 42:29.672
The robots… aren't just looking
for their engines anymore.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.634
They're looking for me.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.636
How do you know that?

42:36.512 --> 42:37.721
They know my name.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.142
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm working on it.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.104
I have to admit
I'm touched you're confiding in me.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.606
Can you keep this a secret?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.694
It's something I'm good at.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.133
So, apparently,

43:14.216 --> 43:16.510
someone's been messing
with the ore we need

43:17.052 --> 43:19.346
to fix the engine and leave this place.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.642
Smith thinks it was me,

43:24.935 --> 43:25.894
but she's wrong.

43:27.771 --> 43:30.065
It was you, wasn't it?

43:52.796 --> 43:54.131
Why would you do that?

43:54.923 --> 43:57.343
Help Will Robinson.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.928
You knew I felt safe here.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.224
Or, at least,
safer than facing whatever's out there.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.312
I get you were trying to protect me, but…

44:10.522 --> 44:12.066
I'm not a kid anymore.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.526
Danger, Will Robinson.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.780
Maybe the only way to put an end to this
is to face the danger.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.909
The robots are gonna come for me.

44:23.118 --> 44:26.038
And when they do,
if my family's anywhere near,

44:26.955 --> 44:28.332
they're gonna get hurt.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.212
Or worse.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.592
Which means,
once we all get to Alpha Centauri…

44:41.720 --> 44:43.514
you and I have to leave them.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.645
If you really wanna help me…

44:51.897 --> 44:53.232
you have to trust me.

44:59.488 --> 45:01.990
Trust Will Robinson.

45:04.118 --> 45:04.993
Yeah.

45:27.015 --> 45:29.226
You shouldn't have to do this on your own.

45:35.941 --> 45:38.152
How many times
did we have to see this thing?

45:39.737 --> 45:40.612
Oh!

45:42.656 --> 45:44.116
Penny noticed every time.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.165
A million first-place trophies
on our shelf at home,

45:51.248 --> 45:53.500
and Judy brings the one for second place.

45:57.963 --> 46:01.967
I think it was intended as a reminder
to push herself harder.

46:13.270 --> 46:17.024
Every time I come into the hub,
I still expect to see them.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.946
Thought maybe that would eventually end,
but it never did.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.703
I try not to think about them.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.166
Is that terrible?

46:36.627 --> 46:37.961
'Cause when I do…

46:41.131 --> 46:44.301
I wonder
if there was something that I missed.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.890
If there was something else
I could have done

46:51.558 --> 46:52.976
to keep us all together.
