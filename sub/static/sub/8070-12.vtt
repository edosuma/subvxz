[laughing]

00:52.553 --> 00:57.425
[music playing]

00:57.525 --> 01:00.027
Well, I have some bad news.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.996
Grandma Harris is not going
to be making her usual holiday

01:03.097 --> 01:03.897
visit this year.

01:03.997 --> 01:04.798
What a shame!

01:07.368 --> 01:09.002
You know, we're
going to miss her.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.639
I know, but cheer up,
because she's coming tonight!

01:11.739 --> 01:12.540
What?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.941
Couldn't you talk her out of it?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.610
Oh, I think it's great.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.380
That's 'cause she loves you.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.781
Well, that's because
I'm nice to her.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.015
Yeah.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.551
You're such a suck up queen.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.386
Yeah.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.887
So this means we're
going to be stuck

01:26.987 --> 01:28.556
here on our Saturday night?

01:28.656 --> 01:32.226
Hey, this is my mother you're
talking about, who we all love.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.494
Besides, if you're
not here she's

01:33.594 --> 01:35.095
going to spend the whole
night talking to me,

01:35.196 --> 01:37.231
and nobody wants that.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.332
Yeah, it'll be great.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.468
A couple hours of real
tense conversation,

01:40.568 --> 01:44.037
followed by a delightful
dinner from hell.

01:44.138 --> 01:44.972
Right.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.106
So I want you to
help your brother

01:46.207 --> 01:47.408
clean up his room for Grandma.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.244
I want it to sparkle.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.581
Well, just pick
up the big chunks.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.649
I'll pick up the big
chunks down here, Mom.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.685
Suck up.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.487
I'm going to be hiding
out in the garage.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.790
Throw a stick at the
window when she's gone,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.057
Chicken.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.760
Well, I hate how this
family acts when she's around.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.661
You get crazy.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.463
The kids get weird.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.800
And I become Captain
Son-In-Law, fending

02:12.900 --> 02:14.835
off the deadliest insults
with his invincible

02:14.935 --> 02:15.969
phony grin of steel.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.941
I'm going to call Jackie
and tell her Mom's coming.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.611
Yeah, like she's going to rush
right over after the big fight

02:23.711 --> 02:24.645
they had last time.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.579
She'll want to be here.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.814
It's her mother.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.781
Yeah, right.

02:27.881 --> 02:31.285
No, watch and learn.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.553
Hi, it's me.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.088
What are you doing today?

02:35.189 --> 02:37.258
Yeah, well, I was just
going to make some

02:37.358 --> 02:40.328
fudge and watch that Kevin
Costner movie, you know,

02:40.428 --> 02:41.429
that's on cable?

02:41.529 --> 02:45.032
The one where he's butt
naked half the time?

02:45.132 --> 02:48.769
Great, three o'clock
will be swell.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.673
She loves her mother.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.576
[music playing]

02:59.046 --> 02:59.947
Isn't the desert beautiful?

03:00.047 --> 03:01.749
We were there for three days.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.051
Here's a picture of
your dad with a cactus.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.187
Look how it seems like
it's raising its arms.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.591
Here's your dad playing
stick-'em-up with the cactus.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.394
And here he is doing
the same thing.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.996
And here again.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.331
He really thought
this was funny.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.535
How about some
more coffee, Grandma?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.870
Thank you sweetheart.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.707
Darlene!

03:30.010 --> 03:32.179
So, when's Jackie coming?

03:32.280 --> 03:33.981
Don't tell me she's still mad.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.249
Oh, no.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.850
She'll be coming over, but
you better be nice to her

03:36.950 --> 03:37.751
this time.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.786
I'm always nice to her!

03:38.886 --> 03:39.887
Oh, right.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.722
That's why you spent
like an hour telling her

03:41.822 --> 03:45.125
how dumping Gary was the very
worst mistake of her life,

03:45.225 --> 03:46.427
and how she's probably
going to end up

03:46.527 --> 03:48.161
a lonely and bitter old maid.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.064
Oh, that's just
the way we talk.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.435
Don't worry, I'll be good.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.603
Hi, Grandma.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.970
There you are!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.707
Now, why didn't you come down
and say hi when I got here?

03:59.807 --> 04:00.674
I don't know.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.477
Why didn't you
come up and say hi?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.213
Look who forgot to give
Grandma a great big kiss!

04:11.519 --> 04:13.721
Here you go Grandma.

04:13.821 --> 04:17.358
I put in skim milk and brown
sugar just the way you like it.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.727
[kissing noises]

04:19.827 --> 04:24.498
Becky is certainly blossoming
into a beautiful young woman.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.701
Well, feel free to speak
directly to her, Mom.

04:27.801 --> 04:32.340
She's that blonde sitting next
to you on the couch there.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.709
Anyone special these
days I should know about?

04:35.809 --> 04:39.012
Mm, well, there's this guy who
just moved here from Evanston,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.014
and he sort of asked
me out tonight.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.083
And what did you tell him?

04:43.183 --> 04:44.418
Well, nothing yet, but--

04:44.518 --> 04:45.819
But she knows
that you only come

04:45.919 --> 04:48.322
to visit once or twice a
year, and so she would rather

04:48.422 --> 04:49.723
spend that time with you.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.291
Oh, that's just silly.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.727
You can't waste an evening
stuck here with me when

04:53.827 --> 04:55.829
you could be out having fun?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.198
Why the hell not?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.567
Thanks, Grandma!

04:59.667 --> 05:01.835
Hey, I can wear that silk blouse
you got me for my birthday.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.671
I better go make a call!

05:03.771 --> 05:05.138
Well, I guess I'll go out too.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.507
If it rains I'll
wear those galoshes

05:06.607 --> 05:07.775
you got me for my birthday.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.676
Oh, no.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.579
You stay here with us.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.681
I don't want to stay here.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.682
I want to go out.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.585
Oh, now where
would you be going?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.453
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.288
Oh, come on, Darlene.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.956
When you're a big
girl like Becky,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.192
you'll get to go on dates too.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.627
Now, wait just a damn minute!

05:26.727 --> 05:28.295
OK, Darlene, get
out in the kitchen.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.296
Come on.
- She can't just--

05:29.397 --> 05:30.230
Keep moving!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.231
--come here and
decide who's old--

05:31.331 --> 05:32.533
- Keep--
- --enough to go out and isn't!

05:32.633 --> 05:33.434
Keep going.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.840
Don't use that kind of
language with your grandma.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.475
Well, how come Becky
can go out and I can't?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.376
Well, Becky had a date.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.444
Well, so could I!

05:43.544 --> 05:45.112
I mean, Grandma acts
like there's no way,

05:45.212 --> 05:46.480
like I'm three years old!

05:46.580 --> 05:49.116
Well, you are acting like
you missed your little nap.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.518
I bet Becky doesn't
even have a date.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.319
She probably just sucked
her way right out the door.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.587
OK.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.788
I've got enough going on
between my mother and my sister.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.158
I don't need any more
trouble from you.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.428
I hate her.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.328
How's it going, honey?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.901
Run away, run away.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.337
[music playing]

06:11.939 --> 06:14.675
Bring on the fudge and
Kevin Costner's butt.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.244
I'm ready to sink my
teeth into both of 'em.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.950
How you doing, Sis?

06:23.050 --> 06:27.287
BEVERLY: Roseanne, are
these towels clean?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.989
You are just evil.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.462
BEVERLY: Is that Jackie?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.465
[screaming]

06:41.301 --> 06:42.870
Don't make me
hurt you, Roseanne!

06:42.970 --> 06:45.138
OK, when I let go,
you're going to get up

06:45.238 --> 06:46.707
and you're going stay here.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.608
Grow up!

06:47.708 --> 06:50.711
[struggling]

06:50.811 --> 06:53.213
Come on, now.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.616
[screaming]

06:57.217 --> 06:58.018
Mom!

06:58.118 --> 06:58.919
Hi.

07:01.489 --> 07:06.259
Oh, tell me, Roseanne, how
many women can look that good

07:06.359 --> 07:07.961
without a drop of makeup?

07:08.061 --> 07:11.064
And your hair's adorable!

07:11.164 --> 07:12.232
Thanks, Mom.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.501
Thanks.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.269
You know, I'm almost glad
your dad couldn't make it.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.840
This gives us girls a
chance to have some fun.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.409
This is Mom, isn't it?

07:22.510 --> 07:23.477
I don't know.

07:23.577 --> 07:27.280
I better check that
birthmark she's got.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.519
No, 665.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.386
Close enough.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.790
[music playing]

07:39.793 --> 07:43.030
Did I mention I just got
a card from Mrs. Quigley?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.164
Our old neighbor?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.332
Mm-hmm.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.901
She said everybody's fine
and her little Jeffrey

07:48.001 --> 07:51.071
should be out of prison
for the holidays.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.842
Boy, those eight years
just flew by, didn't they?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.544
Remember when
Jeffrey talked you

07:56.644 --> 07:57.978
into playing spin the bottle?

07:58.078 --> 08:03.283
Yeah, and kissed me and his
retainer fell off in my mouth.

08:03.383 --> 08:07.621
My little angel was
playing spin the bottle?

08:07.721 --> 08:08.522
Oh, sure, Jackie.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.423
Now you got me in trouble.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.324
Ground her, Mom!

08:11.424 --> 08:12.225
Ground her!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.527
Ground her!

08:13.627 --> 08:15.629
Anything else you want
to tell me while I'm knee

08:15.729 --> 08:19.399
deep in this cheap Chardonnay?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.569
OK.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.370
Remember this one
weekend when you

08:23.470 --> 08:26.574
and dad went off to one of his
patio furniture conventions?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.474
Oh.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.642
Oh, what?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.679
You two have some
kind of wild party?

08:31.779 --> 08:32.913
Yeah.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.949
In Chicago.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.151
Oh, now she's thinking now.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.386
Oh, right.
Now let's see.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.721
Is she going to yell
at us for something

08:40.821 --> 08:43.256
we did over 22 years ago, or--

08:43.356 --> 08:44.157
JACKIE: Oh.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.058
[laughing]

08:45.158 --> 08:45.993
JACKIE: There you go!

08:46.093 --> 08:47.961
OK, Mom!

08:48.061 --> 08:50.430
You two are terrible.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.865
Hey.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.167
I have one that's even better.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.535
OK.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.671
OK.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.239
Remember my friend Janine?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.440
Oh, yes.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.911
You used to stay at her
house till all hours.

09:04.011 --> 09:04.812
OK.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.747
Well, there was no Janine.

09:12.686 --> 09:13.787
Janine was Dan!

09:17.157 --> 09:18.659
Roseanne!

09:18.759 --> 09:21.328
I thought you were studying.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.496
Well, I always got good marks.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.667
Yeah, mostly on your neck.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.068
All right, it's my turn now.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.738
Remember the design
school I applied

09:30.838 --> 09:32.673
to that never answered back?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.241
I actually got in!

09:40.648 --> 09:41.448
You were accepted?

09:41.548 --> 09:42.449
Yeah!

09:42.549 --> 09:44.084
Only I threw the
letter away before you

09:44.184 --> 09:46.854
guys had a chance to see it.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.022
You knew how much
your father and I wanted

09:49.122 --> 09:51.224
you to go to that school.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.061
Well, I didn't.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.729
Hey!

09:55.829 --> 09:58.799
Remember that time when I told
you guys that Ringo actually

09:58.899 --> 10:01.068
called me up on the phone?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.903
I guess now we see
what happens when

10:03.003 --> 10:05.338
we squander our opportunities.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.340
Don't start, Mom.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.309
Well, maybe if
you'd gone to design

10:09.409 --> 10:11.578
school you'd have a career
now, instead of just wasting--

10:11.679 --> 10:14.381
Instead of just wasting my
life bouncing around from one

10:14.481 --> 10:15.348
meaningless job to the next.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.483
Hey!

10:16.583 --> 10:19.086
Hey, you guys, come on,
let's grab a vegetable

10:19.186 --> 10:21.054
and start chopping!

10:21.154 --> 10:22.923
Oh, she's going to
tell me now everything

10:23.023 --> 10:25.625
I've ever done wrong in my life.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.060
Come on.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.162
I know you're dying to.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.132
I just wish for
once I didn't have to.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.867
I'll make it easy for you, OK?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.836
I'm a screw up.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.738
Jackie, you are
not a screw up.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.907
Mom, you tell her
she's not a screw up.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.212
I'm out of here.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.413
Jackie!

10:46.513 --> 10:47.781
What is it with you?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.082
What do you have to
do that to her for?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.718
Why can't you just
let her live her life?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.720
Because she had potential!

10:52.820 --> 10:54.487
She had a spark!

10:54.587 --> 10:57.190
We just didn't want
to see it go to waste.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.226
Your father and I used
to say to each other,

10:59.326 --> 11:02.429
there's no limit to
what Jackie can do.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.330
You guys said that?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.665
You said I had a spark?

11:05.766 --> 11:06.800
Oh, yes.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.836
Your father was convinced
you'd be a lawyer

11:08.936 --> 11:11.739
because you love to argue.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.206
Really?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.542
Well, why do you think we
worried about you so much?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.644
I mean, we were never that
worried about Roseanne.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.179
We knew what she
was going to be.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.453
Oh?

11:26.553 --> 11:27.520
What?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.690
Safe and comfortable
and a good mommy,

11:30.791 --> 11:33.927
just like you are now.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.996
So, uh, what are
you saying, Mother?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.965
You're saying that
all I can ever be

11:38.065 --> 11:39.967
is some ordinary housewife?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.002
Oh, Roseanne.

11:42.102 --> 11:47.174
You have a nice house,
beautiful children.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.075
A husband.

11:50.744 --> 11:54.782
There is nothing wrong at
all with being ordinary.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.318
DAN: Hey, how's it going?

12:01.688 --> 12:03.924
Run away, run away!

12:04.024 --> 12:05.325
[music playing]

12:07.260 --> 12:10.798
So my mother is in there
like doing these back flips

12:10.898 --> 12:12.399
over Jackie, you know?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.067
I'm the one that turned out OK!

12:14.167 --> 12:17.137
Jackie's a screw up!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.539
Roll with it, honey.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.408
Roll with it?

12:21.508 --> 12:23.610
What the hell is that
supposed to mean.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.613
I don't know, I just figured
it was my turn to speak.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.849
ROSEANNE: [sighs]

12:28.949 --> 12:31.051
That's OK, because I finished
watching the whole game.

12:31.151 --> 12:35.322
This was just the overtime.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.357
I mean, I'm really
hurt here, you know.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.659
I just can't believe it,
that it was always like,

12:39.759 --> 12:43.663
Jackie could be this great
astronaut or the president,

12:43.763 --> 12:49.536
and Roseanne could be
some great organ donor.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.371
Dad?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.040
Oh, sorry.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.607
What is it, Darlene.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.210
Well, actually, it was Dad
that I wanted to talk to, Mom.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.880
Well, there he is.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.114
All right.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.582
Margie just called and
invited me over for dinner.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.483
No!

13:03.583 --> 13:05.085
You are here tonight!

13:05.185 --> 13:07.287
And I don't appreciate
your going over my head

13:07.387 --> 13:08.421
to your father.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.790
If I say no, he's going
to say no to, right Dan?

13:10.891 --> 13:11.691
Yes.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.593
No.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.762
It's one night, Darlene.

13:15.863 --> 13:16.696
OK?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.631
One night out of
your entire life,

13:18.731 --> 13:24.504
and I think that you
can just roll with it.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.805
That's sound advice, Darlene.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.910
Now go on and get in there.

13:30.010 --> 13:30.810
Go on.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.412
You, you come too, Dan.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.746
Come on.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.448
We're going to have
a nice family dinner.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.197
This is a really
good roast, Mom.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.664
Oh, I don't know.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.767
Seems a little ordinary to me.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.436
I never did learn how to cook.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.171
Well, you had
other talents, dear.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.072
Really?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.140
Like what?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.774
Would you like some salt?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.611
Roseanne, you know I'm
not allowed salt in my diet.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.746
DJ: Can I have
some more potatoes?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.348
Here you are, dear.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.422
You know, Jackie, not only
is Roseanne a good cook,

14:15.522 --> 14:17.958
but she keeps this house going
like a well-oiled machine.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.027
I don't know how she manages,
what with her job and all

14:20.127 --> 14:21.361
the other stuff she does.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.197
Like what stuff?

14:24.297 --> 14:31.438
Like-- like the,
um, PTA committee.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.341
I don't know how they
manage without her.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.945
I quit that over
two years ago, Jackie.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.014
Well, obviously your work
there was finished, honey.

14:41.114 --> 14:45.618
And she sold over 50 tickets
to the Elks glaucoma dance.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.722
Which means I must know
how to dial a phone, huh?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.959
You know, and DJ has
scouts every Saturday,

14:52.059 --> 14:56.729
which also means I had to
master the fine art of driving.

14:56.829 --> 15:01.301
Boy, I'm just a regular
Renaissance woman, aren't I?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.302
So, Becky, honey.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.870
Tell me about the
boy you're dating.

15:03.971 --> 15:04.771
I don't know.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.274
All my friends he's really cute.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.775
You know, Darlene,
you're lucky to have

15:08.875 --> 15:10.243
such a popular sister.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.680
When you start dating she
can give you some pointers.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.015
Yeah, well if
she's so popular,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.984
just ask us which one
of us got felt up?

15:22.522 --> 15:25.325
Darlene, leave the table.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.459
Yeah, I knew that'd do it.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.498
I have an idea.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.399
Let's skip dessert.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.300
Yeah, I'm full.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.501
Let's hit the sack.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.402
No, no.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.736
Sit down!

15:36.836 --> 15:41.008
Roseane, how about some of
your fabulous Dutch apple pie?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.875
You make that with
cinnamon, right?

15:42.976 --> 15:44.177
Nutmeg, Mom.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.580
One and a quarter
teaspoons of nutmeg.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.119
You know, speaking of pies,
one day when these two were

15:52.219 --> 15:54.887
just knee high to a
grasshopper, I went out

15:54.988 --> 15:57.224
back to call them for supper.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.592
Well, Jackie was
over by the fence

15:59.692 --> 16:01.995
building a village
out of those LEGOs.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.796
Oh.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.534
Oh, it was quite a
project, believe me.

16:07.634 --> 16:13.673
She had traffic lights and
skyscrapers and hospitals--

16:13.773 --> 16:16.709
We get the picture, Mom.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.880
Anyway, Roseanne was
nowhere to be seen.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.816
Well, I looked and looked.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.853
And finally found her
behind that big maple

16:26.953 --> 16:28.421
tree near the ditch.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.458
There she sat in her
white ruffled dress,

16:31.558 --> 16:35.628
completely covered with
dirt and making mud pies.

16:35.728 --> 16:40.300
[laughing] So you see,
Roseanne making pies

16:40.400 --> 16:41.834
must be in your blood.

16:41.934 --> 16:46.073
[laughing]

16:46.173 --> 16:48.408
[laughing] Speaking of blood--

16:48.508 --> 16:51.944
DAN: What time are you
shoving off tomorrow, Bev?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.446
Look, Grandma, I
really got to go.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.816
But we haven't had
a chance to talk!

16:56.916 --> 17:00.453
OK, uh, what do you
want to talk about?

17:00.553 --> 17:03.723
Well, maybe she wants to
talk about my mashed potatoes.

17:03.823 --> 17:07.194
How creamy smooth
they are, maybe, huh?

17:07.294 --> 17:10.097
Or maybe my biscuits, how
light and airy, the way

17:10.197 --> 17:13.933
they just fly across the room!

17:14.033 --> 17:16.636
Or maybe she wants to talk
about the other 10 million

17:16.736 --> 17:20.373
ordinary things I do
in my ordinary life.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.176
Excuse me.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.078
Is she getting enough iron?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.584
Hey, hey.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.353
What is your problem?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.089
My problem is
I've got no spark.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.890
Oh, Roseanne.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.426
I didn't have to
end up ordinary.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.094
I maybe could have been
something different if she

17:41.194 --> 17:43.996
would have expected anything out
of me like she did out of you.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.798
Oh, you mean you
missed out on the chance

17:45.898 --> 17:47.500
to be a neurotic mess.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.102
Poor baby.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.403
But it ain't right, Jackie.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.371
She shouldn't have done that.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.206
She should treated us the same?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.007
You always treat Becky
and Darlene the same?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.209
Yeah, I do.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.145
What, you don't--
you don't think I do?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.947
No, all I'm saying is that
it's no big deal if she thought

18:01.047 --> 18:02.815
that I had potential,
because she's always going

18:02.915 --> 18:04.584
to think I messed up my life.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.019
She's always going to think
that you're the best doggone mud

18:07.120 --> 18:08.988
pie maker in the whole world.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.757
She decided that
a long time ago.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.425
It's not going to
change, and that's

18:12.525 --> 18:15.328
just the way mothers are.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.264
Not this one.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.931
JACKIE: [sigh]

18:19.031 --> 18:21.834
[music playing]

18:26.773 --> 18:29.176
I'm not going back down
there, so you can forget it.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.109
I made it through dinner.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.444
That was the deal,
and I don't have

18:31.544 --> 18:34.347
to take any more Becky beautiful
garbage from your mother.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.617
Hey, you have a little
bit more respect for your--

18:37.717 --> 18:38.651
forget it, you're right.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.590
You mean you're not
mad because of what I

18:43.690 --> 18:44.524
did at dinner?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.125
Well, I was at
first, you know.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.927
I thought you were
really out of line 'til

18:48.027 --> 18:50.029
I started throwing biscuits.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.599
You threw biscuits at Grandma?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.601
No, I didn't want to hit DJ.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.336
You know how soft his skull is.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.409
Oh, I miss all the good stuff.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.110
Hey, Darlene.

19:04.211 --> 19:09.182
Do you think that I encourage
you, you know, to do stuff.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.218
Well, I don't know.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.052
What are you talking about?

19:13.152 --> 19:19.259
Well, do you think that
I, uh, expect more out

19:19.359 --> 19:21.894
of Becky than I do out of you?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.196
I don't know.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.632
I mean, it's like you expect
Becky things out of Becky,

19:25.732 --> 19:27.400
like good grades.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.969
Well, you know, I expect
good grades out of you, too.

19:30.069 --> 19:30.903
I just never get them.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.276
Well, I think we both
know that I'm smarter,

19:36.376 --> 19:37.477
just in a different way.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.045
It's like if you dropped
me and Becky in the middle

19:39.145 --> 19:43.483
of the woods, I'd make it home
and poor little Becky'd crawl

19:43.583 --> 19:44.917
into a hollow log and die.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.791
Well, that's why
I had two daughters.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.959
I always carry a spare.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.232
You know, I'm sorry
I said I hated Grandma.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.268
I guess I love her, it's
just that sometimes I

20:01.368 --> 20:02.335
don't like her.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.636
Yeah, I know.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.638
Well, sometimes she makes
it kind of tough, you know.

20:05.738 --> 20:09.442
But then, then there's these
other times where you just want

20:09.542 --> 20:12.144
to take her face in
your hands and twist

20:12.245 --> 20:15.348
it 'til her head pops off.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.285
Well, it's a good thing I
never feel that way about you.

20:18.385 --> 20:22.054
Yeah, it's a real good thing.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.824
You know, I got this theory.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.661
It's like, Grandma was probably
a better mom than her mom,

20:28.761 --> 20:31.898
and you're definitely a
better mom than grandma was.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.600
That's a good theory.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.803
So, by the time I'm a mom
I'll be like this awesome mom

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
because I'll have learned from
all the mistakes you guys made.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.307
Whoa.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.207
Heavy.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.246
Why do you want to bet that
Grandma's downstairs making

20:47.347 --> 20:50.216
Becky look at her 400
pictures she took on her trip

20:50.317 --> 20:51.984
to Arizona?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.654
Yeah, Becky'll probably
never get out of here.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.324
Good!

20:57.424 --> 20:59.492
Well, I ought to head
back to the snake pit.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.227
You want to come with me?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.129
You going to be throwing
any more biscuits?

21:03.229 --> 21:06.232
Yeah, if I can
get a clear shot.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.669
[music playing]

21:13.239 --> 21:14.974
Here we are the
world's largest

21:15.074 --> 21:17.977
reptile museum, Lizard Land.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.513
That's a lizard.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.449
Here's a bigger lizard.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.983
Oh, and that's the
owner of the museum!

21:24.083 --> 21:27.186
Very nice young man.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.690
We told him all
about you, Jackie.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.393
He might be calling you.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.327
His name is Fess.

21:38.097 --> 21:41.167
Here's your dad playing
stick-'em-up with a lizard.

21:41.267 --> 21:45.438
It's not as funny as the cactus,
but you know your father.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.775
I think that's where you get
you sense of humor, Roseanne.
