00:46.445 --> 00:49.381
Once upon a
time there was a love lady,

00:49.414 --> 00:52.384
who reigned in the kingdom
of the United States.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.653
Well, not really reigned,

00:54.686 --> 00:57.457
but it opened a door from her
past.

00:57.490 --> 01:01.194
Oh dear, there is so much
to tell in this story.

01:01.226 --> 01:04.129
I know, let's all watch
the movie together!

01:39.731 --> 01:42.334
Gerard, you are using
the gold tapers in there?

01:42.367 --> 01:43.335
Yes.

01:43.368 --> 01:44.804
And we do need the red
wine glasses as well.

01:44.837 --> 01:45.671
Yes ma'am.

01:45.703 --> 01:46.572
This isn't awkward.

01:47.939 --> 01:49.207
I know, we were doing it today

01:49.240 --> 01:51.176
because of the dinner tonight.

01:51.209 --> 01:52.577
Can we just uninvite them?

01:52.611 --> 01:54.413
That is not an option.

01:54.445 --> 01:55.847
Channing, do you have the latest
list?

01:55.881 --> 01:58.650
Do you want the pre
Carrington list or the post?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.185
Oh, we have a post?

02:00.218 --> 02:01.586
Or is that just wishful
thinking?

02:04.489 --> 02:06.325
The name tag is
backwards.

02:10.862 --> 02:13.432
Oh great, Preston's here.

02:15.433 --> 02:17.302
I guess they really are coming.

02:17.336 --> 02:19.672
Assume you heard the
announcement.

02:19.705 --> 02:23.409
Just think, all this
will be under my control

02:23.442 --> 02:25.278
in just a few short months.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.778
In your dreams.

02:26.812 --> 02:28.881
I want Mallory next to Kate,

02:28.913 --> 02:30.916
and we'll put Carol on the
other side of the president.

02:30.949 --> 02:33.652
And I want a date
with Denzel Washington.

02:33.686 --> 02:34.787
He's married.

02:34.819 --> 02:36.521
See how impossible life is?

02:36.555 --> 02:37.590
Mm-hmm.

02:37.622 --> 02:39.792
Besides, we already have
them at the kiddie table.

02:39.824 --> 02:41.025
Oh.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.829
Touch one card on that table
and I will break your wrist.

02:43.861 --> 02:46.598
Sahara Club next to Offshore
Drilling.

02:46.632 --> 02:48.768
You wanna start a food fight?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.536
What did I just tell you?

02:50.568 --> 02:53.972
Now, back away from the table.

02:54.006 --> 02:57.576
Mrs. Morales, I would like
you to meet Chantelle Lumonet.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.378
Bonjour.

02:59.411 --> 03:02.414
And the publisher of Royalty
magazine, Elise DuBois.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.649
Enchante, and right on time.

03:03.681 --> 03:04.750
Shall we get started?

03:05.918 --> 03:07.118
Ladies.

03:07.152 --> 03:08.286
Channing, do you have the
latest menu and wine pairing?

03:08.319 --> 03:09.921
I'm working on it.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.490
And your dress is in the ante
room,

03:11.522 --> 03:13.459
and hair and makeup are
ready, so, let's go.

03:13.491 --> 03:15.794
Perfect, George, salad fork
missing.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.664
Thank you, Frankie.

03:19.698 --> 03:22.635
No matter how early I get
up, you're already at it.

03:22.668 --> 03:24.302
El Presidente!

03:24.336 --> 03:24.971
Good morning, Rolly.

03:25.003 --> 03:25.837
Good morning, sir.

03:25.871 --> 03:26.739
Morning, Frank.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.340
Good morning, Mr.
President.

03:28.373 --> 03:29.542
Hey, how was the dinner?

03:29.574 --> 03:31.943
The most peace we've had in
four years.

03:31.977 --> 03:33.246
It was wonderful.

03:33.278 --> 03:36.781
Well, get ready for another
four,

03:36.814 --> 03:39.317
and this one's gonna be a
bruiser.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.219
Looks like it.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.322
Oh, did you hear about
Carrington?

03:44.056 --> 03:46.359
That would actually be fun.

03:50.729 --> 03:52.531
Oh, beautiful, yeah.

03:52.563 --> 03:53.733
Hello sweetheart.

03:53.765 --> 03:54.633
Ooh.

03:56.401 --> 03:58.804
Yeah, yeah, we heard.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.741
I'm still processing the info.

04:03.408 --> 04:04.911
Yeah, no, we'll talk after this.

04:06.044 --> 04:10.015
Mm-hmm , hey,
how did you dodge this bullet?

04:11.050 --> 04:11.918
See you later.

04:15.586 --> 04:19.491
CNN wants a quote from you
about Mallory Carrington.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.293
Oh, what do I know that they
don't?

04:21.326 --> 04:22.427
That she's married to Harold,

04:22.461 --> 04:24.863
who's just thrown his hat
in the ring for president.

04:24.896 --> 04:26.464
You know what they want.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.367
They aren't gonna get it.

04:28.399 --> 04:31.569
I'm thrilled for the Carringtons,
I wish them the best.

04:31.603 --> 04:33.639
Is there a barf bag in the
room?

04:33.672 --> 04:35.007
Yeah, and thank god you're
not wearing that dress,

04:35.040 --> 04:36.809
I saw the way Julie's smelling
it.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.576
They also wanna know
if they're still invited

04:38.610 --> 04:39.979
to the dinner tonight.

04:40.012 --> 04:40.846
Ah, seriously?

04:40.879 --> 04:41.680
Yes.

04:41.713 --> 04:43.783
The barbarians are at the
gate.

04:43.815 --> 04:45.617
Just wing it, you'll be fine.

04:45.651 --> 04:46.552
I'm off my leash?

04:46.584 --> 04:47.986
You are.

04:48.019 --> 04:48.687
Fantastic.

04:48.721 --> 04:49.954
The ambassador's wife is here.

04:49.987 --> 04:50.822
Oh great, yeah.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.725
Mallory Carrington is on the
phone.

04:52.757 --> 04:53.793
What should I tell her?

04:53.826 --> 04:55.461
Oh, that's a loaded question.

04:56.995 --> 04:59.531
Find out what she wants
to hear and tell her that.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.766
She wants to hear it from you.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.869
I'm sorry, here.

05:04.502 --> 05:05.538
Mallory!

05:05.571 --> 05:07.640
I was delighted to hear
Harold's throwing his hat

05:07.673 --> 05:08.908
in the ring for president.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.810
Oh, come on Kate, you
can do better than that.

05:13.478 --> 05:15.348
I'm sincerely thrilled

05:15.380 --> 05:16.514
that Harold will be representing

05:16.548 --> 05:18.516
your party's nomination for
president.

05:18.550 --> 05:22.588
I can't think of a more
fascinating candidate.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.056
Well, you can't possibly
be happy about the influence

05:25.089 --> 05:27.525
that I have over the
millennials.

05:27.559 --> 05:30.029
Face it, Kate, it's a new day in
America.

05:30.062 --> 05:32.798
Yes Mallory, it's always
a new day in America.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.100
Every 24 hours.

05:37.502 --> 05:38.370
Hmm.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.442
Okay,
can you lift your face

05:43.475 --> 05:44.844
more towards the light?

05:45.810 --> 05:47.112
You gave up teaching for this?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.181
Mm-hmm.

05:48.213 --> 05:51.584
Professor Kathryn Morales
on the cover of Royalty.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.055
Do I look silly?

05:56.088 --> 05:56.956
Yes.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.658
Okay,
just one or two more, okay?

06:00.692 --> 06:01.860
And yeah, that's a wrap.

06:01.894 --> 06:02.728
- Thank you.
- Great, thank you.

06:02.761 --> 06:04.028
Let's go.

06:04.062 --> 06:06.132
Okay, that ate into
the humanitarian award,

06:06.165 --> 06:07.867
which is now butting up
against literacy speech,

06:07.899 --> 06:09.100
- so we have to get going.
- Okay.

06:09.134 --> 06:10.836
The mics are in the office,
the car is waiting outside.

06:10.869 --> 06:11.904
Baily, do you have her purse?

06:11.937 --> 06:12.771
I've got it.

06:12.805 --> 06:13.605
Great, let's go.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.507
Wait, we have to get the dress
off!

06:14.540 --> 06:15.408
Oh, right!

06:16.675 --> 06:17.910
Here are the notes for the
interview.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.145
Ah, leave the talking
points for Mallory,

06:20.178 --> 06:21.813
in case she's the next First
Lady.

06:21.846 --> 06:23.716
If I don't know who I am by now,

06:23.749 --> 06:25.685
it's too late to figure it out.

06:26.619 --> 06:30.556
Hello, I'm Kathryn Morales,
my friends call me Kate.

06:44.502 --> 06:45.538
Have you seen Kate?

06:46.771 --> 06:48.173
I need to find her.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.875
We have at least three
more meetings today.

06:49.908 --> 06:50.776
Mrs. Morales, Mrs. Morales.

06:50.809 --> 06:52.044
Yes?

06:52.076 --> 06:53.812
The president is asking for
you.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.079
He's not feeling well.

06:55.112 --> 06:56.281
Why didn't someone call me?

06:56.314 --> 06:58.516
Well, we tried to call your
cell, but it was cut off.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.853
I'm surrounded by people
with cells that are on.

07:00.886 --> 07:02.621
Okay, I understand and I
can take you to him right now.

07:02.653 --> 07:03.456
Okay.

07:03.488 --> 07:04.156
Okay.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.194
Oh my gosh, Alex.

07:08.226 --> 07:10.462
Someone get the doctor, now!

07:10.495 --> 07:11.630
Go get the doctor, go get the
doctor!

07:12.764 --> 07:13.999
Oh my gosh.

07:14.031 --> 07:16.668
You're gonna be fine, doctor's
on his way.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.237
It's gonna be fine.

07:18.269 --> 07:19.704
Where's the doctor?

07:21.572 --> 07:22.206
Make way, gentlemen.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.709
You'll be just fine, okay?

07:24.742 --> 07:26.879
I'm here Kate, I'm here.

07:26.911 --> 07:27.812
You'll be okay, Mr. President.

07:27.846 --> 07:28.848
What are you feeling?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.515
Can't breathe.

07:30.548 --> 07:33.017
Okay, just stay calm, stay
calm.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.019
You're gonna be okay.

07:37.622 --> 07:41.961
They said they'll need
to rob Peter to pay Paul.

07:43.127 --> 07:44.663
You're in good shape.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.599
They'll find good arteries, I'm
sure.

07:47.565 --> 07:48.600
I'm sorry, sweetie,

07:49.435 --> 07:52.737
this is the last thing
you need on your plate.

07:53.838 --> 07:54.774
You will do anything

07:54.807 --> 07:57.543
to get out of dinner with the
Carringtons.

07:57.576 --> 08:00.012
Humor, I like that.

08:03.615 --> 08:04.617
Kate?

08:04.649 --> 08:05.984
Yeah?

08:06.017 --> 08:09.020
Please promise me you'll
support Taylor.

08:09.821 --> 08:12.124
He'll need all the help he can
get.

08:12.156 --> 08:14.894
Hey, don't worry about that.

08:14.927 --> 08:16.095
You'll be up in no time.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.198
Please, promise me.

08:20.232 --> 08:21.767
Taylor's like a son.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.136
Yes, yes, of course, I
promise.

08:24.168 --> 08:26.305
You know I've got your back.

08:26.338 --> 08:27.873
But sweetheart, don't talk like
that,

08:27.906 --> 08:28.973
you're gonna be just fine.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.177
Alex?

08:33.144 --> 08:34.612
Alex!

08:43.654 --> 08:45.057
Stand back!

08:45.090 --> 08:46.959
Move, clear the way!

08:46.991 --> 08:50.962
Make way for the vice
president, clear the way.

08:54.365 --> 08:58.837
Raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

09:00.304 --> 09:03.942
I, Taylor Brooks, do solemnly
swear.

09:03.975 --> 09:07.145
I, Taylor Brooks, do solemnly
swear.

09:07.178 --> 09:09.615
That I will faithfully
execute

09:09.648 --> 09:12.850
the office of the president
of the United States.

09:12.884 --> 09:16.120
That I will faithfully execute

09:16.153 --> 09:19.991
the office of the president
of the United States.

09:20.024 --> 09:22.562
And will to the best of my
ability

09:23.629 --> 09:27.099
preserve, protect and defend

09:28.265 --> 09:30.935
the constitution of these United
States.

09:30.969 --> 09:32.805
So help me God.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.173
So help me God.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.125
Grandfather.

09:56.794 --> 09:57.795
Are you all right?

09:57.830 --> 10:02.668
Yes, yes, I was
remembering a time long ago.

10:03.501 --> 10:06.037
Magnificent recollections of my
youth,

10:06.071 --> 10:08.641
now the dusty memories of an old
man.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.144
They've sent for you, ready?

10:12.177 --> 10:13.345
Yes.

10:13.378 --> 10:14.847
Yes, my darling, of course.

10:29.794 --> 10:30.828
What is this?

10:30.861 --> 10:32.831
Woop!

10:32.864 --> 10:35.434
Magnificent, magnificent.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.286
Last
night, Harold Carrington

10:55.320 --> 10:58.057
won his party's primary for
president.

10:58.090 --> 11:01.793
I cannot believe that woman
could ever take Kate's place.

11:01.826 --> 11:02.961
She'll probably paint The
White House

11:02.994 --> 11:05.096
hot pink with smiley faces.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.765
Hashtag selfie central.

11:07.798 --> 11:09.434
Can you turn that up, please?

11:09.467 --> 11:10.935
His wife,
Mallory,

11:10.969 --> 11:12.771
was with him on the campaign
trail

11:12.803 --> 11:15.240
when his victory was announced.

11:15.273 --> 11:16.142
Ugh!

11:17.808 --> 11:21.447
Okay, I think it is safe to
say

11:21.480 --> 11:23.981
that none of us saw that coming.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.317
But, let's try and make the most
of it.

11:25.350 --> 11:28.220
So, does anybody have any ideas?

11:28.253 --> 11:31.490
Well, we could do a press
release, thank our voters?

11:31.523 --> 11:33.459
Maybe we can thank them in a
video?

11:33.491 --> 11:34.459
Or in a Tweet?

11:34.493 --> 11:37.496
Or wait, what was that
other thing you said?

11:37.528 --> 11:38.831
Whatever it was, it worked.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.232
You have millions of followers

11:40.264 --> 11:42.300
on every single social media
account.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.102
You just need to harvest them.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.370
It was Snapshot, that was off
the chain!

11:46.403 --> 11:47.905
Off the chain.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.173
Well, I'll tell you who's off
the chain.

11:49.206 --> 11:50.975
Pookie's off the chain.

11:51.009 --> 11:52.244
Come, come on.

11:54.513 --> 11:55.848
I have to get ready.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.182
I can't believe they caught me

11:57.215 --> 11:59.084
in that interview dressed like
this.

11:59.116 --> 11:59.950
Look at my hair!

11:59.985 --> 12:01.854
Mallory, honey, you are going
to be

12:01.886 --> 12:04.255
the hottest First Lady
this country has ever seen.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey,

12:05.524 --> 12:07.493
I still have to figure all this
stuff out.

12:07.525 --> 12:10.128
I wasn't even planning on
winning the...

12:10.162 --> 12:11.230
Primary.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.533
Primary, I was just
looking to get some name ID.

12:14.566 --> 12:15.768
Okay, bye.

12:17.302 --> 12:19.337
Okay people, it's time to get
serious.

12:19.370 --> 12:20.805
First thing's first.

12:21.572 --> 12:22.807
Who's getting coffee?

12:27.511 --> 12:28.412
You know what?

12:28.447 --> 12:30.249
It's really good that we're
doing this.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.417
Yeah, she really needs some
cheering up.

12:32.450 --> 12:33.919
And a good bran muffin.

12:35.253 --> 12:37.089
Just because someone is over
60,

12:37.121 --> 12:38.890
does not mean that they
need a bran muffin.

12:38.923 --> 12:41.092
- Uh, yes it does.
- Yes it does.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.260
Yeah, it does.

12:43.995 --> 12:44.830
Thanks.

12:44.863 --> 12:45.798
Whatever.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.466
Yeah, I'm better.

12:47.499 --> 12:51.235
Okay, I'll talk to you soon,
thank you.

12:51.269 --> 12:54.139
The nation
is still mourning his loss-

12:54.172 --> 12:56.274
- Here's to 40 years of us.

12:57.542 --> 12:58.511
And to many more.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.216
I just, I don't know if I'm
really

13:04.249 --> 13:09.254
ready to start teaching again so
soon.

13:09.754 --> 13:10.623
Taylor Brooks,

13:10.655 --> 13:11.723
about this victory,

13:11.756 --> 13:14.458
to see if he's worried about
Carrington's popularity

13:14.491 --> 13:16.394
and his position in the polls.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.267
Oh, hey girls!

13:22.466 --> 13:23.601
You forgot.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.437
No, no, I didn't forget.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.072
Come in, come in.

13:27.105 --> 13:27.940
She forgot.

13:27.972 --> 13:29.140
- She forgot.
- No.

13:29.173 --> 13:30.475
I think you forgot.

13:30.508 --> 13:32.009
I did not.

13:32.043 --> 13:34.346
So good to see you guys.

13:34.379 --> 13:35.914
I totally forgot.

13:39.618 --> 13:40.451
Ooh, thank you.

13:45.289 --> 13:47.091
Are you guys trying to tell me
something?

13:47.125 --> 13:48.293
It was them.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.894
How is Taylor gonna pull this
off?

13:49.927 --> 13:51.963
I can't believe they won the
primaries.

13:51.996 --> 13:53.966
I mean, who was voting, third
graders?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.533
It's all those years on MVTV.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.369
I mean, it gave her an instant
fan base.

13:57.402 --> 13:59.471
It's all about celebrity now.

13:59.504 --> 14:02.039
Could we just rent him a First
Lady?

14:02.072 --> 14:03.574
I can call central casting.

14:03.607 --> 14:04.642
Well, why can't someone run

14:04.676 --> 14:06.411
against Mallory for First Lady?

14:06.443 --> 14:07.879
I mean, you keep talking about

14:07.913 --> 14:10.014
the dignity of the office,

14:10.048 --> 14:11.082
the importance of the position,

14:11.115 --> 14:13.485
protecting the national
heritage.

14:14.184 --> 14:18.055
I don't sound like that, do I?

14:18.089 --> 14:19.658
You can't just run for First
Lady.

14:19.691 --> 14:21.160
But why not?

14:22.394 --> 14:23.995
I mean, it's a hard job.

14:24.028 --> 14:26.197
I mean, we all know it first
hand.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.432
There have been a lot of First
Ladies

14:27.465 --> 14:28.966
who hated the position.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.001
Or their husbands.

14:31.035 --> 14:32.670
I loved both.

14:32.703 --> 14:35.106
But really, why should
you have to lose your job,

14:35.139 --> 14:36.641
just because your husband died?

14:38.309 --> 14:39.444
It's okay, Bailey.

14:41.145 --> 14:43.281
We all know Alex is dead.

14:43.315 --> 14:44.616
I am so sorry.

14:44.649 --> 14:46.951
I didn't, it just came out.

14:46.985 --> 14:50.055
No, no, you're right.

14:50.087 --> 14:51.456
I mean, the minute Alex died,

14:51.489 --> 14:54.994
I not only lost my husband
and my best friend,

14:56.727 --> 14:57.596
I lost my job.

14:59.464 --> 15:02.000
Well, it's been fun.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.469
They weren't even on the radar.

15:04.735 --> 15:07.239
Alex warned me this could
happen.

15:07.272 --> 15:09.141
It's this generation.

15:09.173 --> 15:10.341
They're screwing up a good
system.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.476
If their frappuccino's not hot
enough,

15:12.509 --> 15:14.413
they throw a tantrum at the
ballot box.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.148
Aren't they supposed to be
cold?

15:16.847 --> 15:18.115
Say goodbye to the days of
calling

15:18.149 --> 15:19.484
the election months in advance.

15:19.517 --> 15:22.020
Yeah, I mean, we thought
this guy was a joke,

15:22.052 --> 15:25.123
till the kids started
thinking he was a rockstar.

15:25.155 --> 15:26.457
What is she wearing?

15:28.326 --> 15:30.428
She looks like my
daughter's Malibu Barbie.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.399
Did she just hand
her coffee to a marine?

15:34.432 --> 15:36.435
- I mean, what the-
- Excuse me,

15:36.467 --> 15:39.137
Mr. President, they're
still waiting for you.

15:39.837 --> 15:42.707
Let's see what the fallout
is before we respond.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.944
If the country is as
shocked as we are, go hard.

15:46.745 --> 15:50.316
If there's youthful enthusiasm,
we need to tread lightly.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.584
Come up with some options.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.187
We'll discuss when I get back.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.423
This is so simple.

15:59.456 --> 16:00.491
Just hear me out.

16:00.524 --> 16:04.663
Taylor is a widower, you
have already done the job.

16:04.696 --> 16:07.666
Alex loved Taylor like a son.

16:07.698 --> 16:08.967
So, here's the deal,

16:12.070 --> 16:15.074
you run for office with Taylor,

16:16.008 --> 16:19.144
as if it were a completely
different job.

16:19.177 --> 16:21.212
Which it is.

16:22.346 --> 16:26.050
Yes, yes, oh my, yes.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.152
This hasn't been done before,
but why not?

16:28.186 --> 16:30.555
Everything's changing, why not
this?

16:30.587 --> 16:34.091
The one thing is, would Taylor
go for it?

16:34.125 --> 16:36.327
Are you kidding me?

16:36.360 --> 16:38.163
That's the only way he's gonna
win.

16:38.196 --> 16:40.065
I know how we can win.

16:40.097 --> 16:41.732
I know how we can win this.

16:41.765 --> 16:44.201
You see that little cutie over
there?

16:44.235 --> 16:45.803
We're gonna put her on the
campaign trail.

16:45.836 --> 16:48.539
There is no way Taylor
Brooks can keep up with that.

16:49.274 --> 16:53.211
Besides, what kind of president
doesn't have a First Lady?

16:53.244 --> 16:54.413
That's plain un-American.

16:55.547 --> 17:00.753
Look, as much as I loved the
job, it wouldn't be the same.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.620
It'd be too painful,

17:02.653 --> 17:05.589
there are just too many
memories in those halls.

17:05.623 --> 17:09.694
Okay, look, what would
George Washington do?

17:10.394 --> 17:13.698
Would he sit there complaining
that the Delaware river is,

17:13.730 --> 17:15.166
"Oh, too cold,"

17:15.200 --> 17:16.567
or the British are, "Oh, too
mean."

17:16.601 --> 17:21.206
No, he knew what needed
to be done, and he did it.

17:21.239 --> 17:23.141
Right, and our country
needs you right now.

17:23.173 --> 17:26.045
You can't let these
clowns win this election.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.346
And Taylor needs you to get
reelected.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.483
This is Channing.

17:34.384 --> 17:39.090
Yes, that sounds like a splendid
idea.

17:40.224 --> 17:42.193
Yes, Mr. President, she's right
here.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.201
Hello Taylor.

17:51.769 --> 17:54.272
Yes, yes, I heard.

17:57.842 --> 18:02.614
Well, that's a unique idea.

18:03.847 --> 18:05.616
I'll have to give it some
thought.

18:07.251 --> 18:09.187
Yes, I promise I will.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.490
Yeah, I'll get back to you.

18:12.523 --> 18:13.391
Thank you.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.360
Did you put him up to this?

18:16.394 --> 18:17.295
- What?
- What? What?

18:17.328 --> 18:17.995
I don't know what you're
talking about.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.263
He suggested the same thing.

18:19.297 --> 18:20.566
- No!
- What?

18:21.232 --> 18:23.601
Where did he get that idea?

18:23.634 --> 18:24.336
Wow.

18:24.368 --> 18:26.804
- I just wonder.
- I don't know.

18:26.837 --> 18:28.740
Look, look.

18:28.772 --> 18:32.309
This would be an abomination
of historical proportions.

18:32.343 --> 18:34.712
You cannot let this happen.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.315
Taylor's on board.

18:37.214 --> 18:38.182
What's the problem?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.354
It's just never been done
before.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.522
Oh, none of this social
media has been done before,

18:44.556 --> 18:46.725
and look what it got us.

18:46.758 --> 18:50.895
This is your chance to make
things right, for everyone.

18:52.462 --> 18:53.764
Including Alex.

18:54.565 --> 18:57.436
You did promise to take care of
Taylor.

18:58.135 --> 19:01.405
And preserve the dignity
of The White House.

19:14.551 --> 19:18.423
Alex Morales was an
inspiration to all who knew him,

19:19.156 --> 19:24.261
and as hard as it has
been to fill his shoes,

19:24.295 --> 19:27.399
it would be impossible to
replace the First Lady.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.268
She and I have discussed this at
length,

19:30.300 --> 19:32.903
and she has graciously agreed

19:32.936 --> 19:35.873
to accompany me on the campaign
trail

19:35.906 --> 19:38.375
running for the office of First
Lady.

19:38.409 --> 19:39.578
Wow!

19:41.813 --> 19:46.818
Well, it's not really an
office, it's more of a position.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.856
However, I think it's a
marvelous idea.

19:54.892 --> 19:57.596
It's logical, she's been in
the position

19:57.628 --> 19:59.530
for almost four years.

19:59.564 --> 20:00.198
Yes.

20:00.231 --> 20:02.466
I think this is wonderful.

20:02.500 --> 20:07.506
I cannot imagine Mallory
Carrington as First Lady.

20:07.905 --> 20:08.973
Uh-huh.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.343
She'd probably turn The
White House into a day spa.

20:12.777 --> 20:14.778
This is brilliant.

20:14.811 --> 20:17.448
They'll win the sympathy
vote, and the boomer vote.

20:17.481 --> 20:18.849
Check this out.

20:18.883 --> 20:22.453
There have been nine First Lady
stand-ins.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.889
I just knew about Buchanan's
niece, what was her name?

20:24.922 --> 20:26.490
Harriet Lane.

20:26.523 --> 20:27.591
- That's right.
- Yeah.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.996
But you know, no one's
actually run for First Lady.

20:31.028 --> 20:33.265
Well, of course they have.

20:33.298 --> 20:34.766
The wife runs with the
candidate,

20:34.798 --> 20:36.734
and then she becomes the First
Lady.

20:36.768 --> 20:38.702
Yeah, but that's a given
because she's the wife,

20:38.736 --> 20:40.272
but a non-wife.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.472
Oh, that's called a
girlfriend.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.341
No, no, I'm asking.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.675
What power does a non-wife have?

20:44.709 --> 20:46.778
Well, you'd have to talk to
Taylor.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.779
Since she wouldn't be the wife,

20:48.813 --> 20:52.050
could she still run his life?

20:52.083 --> 20:53.317
Well, I can tell you,

20:53.351 --> 20:56.821
any woman with power is gonna
run someone's life, trust me.

20:58.789 --> 21:01.292
Well, to wonderful friends.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.094
Yes.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.961
- Cheers!
- Your great support,

21:03.994 --> 21:05.562
and to Alex.

21:05.596 --> 21:06.730
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

21:06.763 --> 21:08.899
- Here, here.
- Here, here.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.470
Ho, ho, ho, ha.

21:14.105 --> 21:14.972
What's funny?

21:15.839 --> 21:19.576
A woman I once knew,
she's quite the character.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.346
What hasn't been done, she will
do.

21:21.378 --> 21:23.748
What has been done, she will do
better.

21:24.715 --> 21:25.783
How do you know her?

21:27.984 --> 21:30.655
Read this first and I shall
tell you.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.492
Where is Harold?

21:34.525 --> 21:35.560
He's late again, isn't he?

21:35.593 --> 21:39.364
I swear, I should be the
one running for president.

21:40.464 --> 21:43.701
Take down all these tacky
posters.

21:43.734 --> 21:46.337
I am so sick of all this
red, white, and blue.

21:47.505 --> 21:48.774
I want bright pastels.

21:50.508 --> 21:51.843
Isn't that a contradiction?

21:53.678 --> 21:55.414
The brighter the better, pow!

21:56.213 --> 21:58.450
As a former professor of
history,

21:58.482 --> 22:00.451
before entering the world of
politics,

22:01.185 --> 22:04.355
don't you think it's a bit
unconventional

22:04.388 --> 22:07.825
running for the office of First
Lady?

22:07.858 --> 22:09.461
Well, actually, Tori,

22:09.493 --> 22:13.097
there have been many women
in our nation's history

22:13.131 --> 22:17.435
not married to the president,
serving as First Lady.

22:17.468 --> 22:20.138
But the big difference here
is that the voters will know,

22:20.171 --> 22:22.874
going in, who that person will
be.

22:27.878 --> 22:28.946
Mallory, Mallory, Mallory.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.181
Just one question, please.

22:30.214 --> 22:32.049
Mrs. Carrington, what do you
think about Kathryn Morales

22:32.083 --> 22:34.018
running for First Lady with
Taylor Brooks?

22:34.050 --> 22:35.986
That puts you in a head
to head battle, doesn't it?

22:36.019 --> 22:37.855
Well, that is the most
ridiculous thing

22:37.888 --> 22:38.556
I've ever heard of.

22:38.589 --> 22:40.958
You can't run for First Lady,

22:40.991 --> 22:43.761
you have to be married
into the position, like me.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.864
A real First Lady contestant.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.831
So you are saying that it is a
contest,

22:47.865 --> 22:50.034
that it is legitimate for her
to run as your competitor,

22:50.067 --> 22:52.569
that it is a real viable
position?

22:52.603 --> 22:56.775
Look, all I'm saying is
I'm legitimate and she's not.

22:56.807 --> 23:00.044
She's an ex-First Lady, that's
all.

23:00.076 --> 23:02.713
She doesn't get a do-over
just because her husband died.

23:06.651 --> 23:10.154
Thank you Mallory Carrington,
you just saved our jobs.

23:10.188 --> 23:14.559
Our motto is breathe in
the breath of a new tomorrow.

23:14.592 --> 23:15.994
With my husband in The White
House,

23:16.027 --> 23:18.196
there is nothing that we can't
do together

23:18.229 --> 23:21.633
as a whole uniful nation.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.971
I feel confident we can pull
this out,

23:27.003 --> 23:29.106
but I hope it's by a comfortable
margin.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.710
Otherwise, all I'll hear

23:32.742 --> 23:35.846
is how Kathryn pulled me over
the line.

23:35.880 --> 23:36.714
The country is
ready

23:36.748 --> 23:38.650
for someone fresh and hip like
Mallory.

23:38.682 --> 23:40.585
Are you saying
the more mature voter is-

23:40.617 --> 23:42.153
- Oh, turn up four!

23:42.185 --> 23:43.420
Kathryn
Morales is over the hill?

23:43.453 --> 23:45.823
She's an elegant
lady that the nation admires,

23:45.856 --> 23:48.926
but times are changing,
values are shifting.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.894
It's happening!

23:49.928 --> 23:50.862
Her style
is just a bit dated.

23:50.894 --> 23:51.695
We are gonna win.

23:51.729 --> 23:53.932
Ah, great, they just ticked
off

23:53.964 --> 23:55.599
a third of the voting block.

23:57.634 --> 23:58.470
Oh, we are so close.

23:58.502 --> 24:00.637
Okay, is Kate ready?

24:00.671 --> 24:01.673
Hey Channing?

24:01.705 --> 24:02.873
Yeah?

24:02.906 --> 24:04.509
Can you get that
rock necklace Alex gave me?

24:04.541 --> 24:06.644
It's in the box on the mantle.

24:07.912 --> 24:09.014
There's three boxes.

24:14.218 --> 24:16.086
No, no, no, not that one.

24:16.119 --> 24:18.055
It's the gold one, here, let me
help you.

24:22.926 --> 24:25.663
So, how are those exit polls
looking?

24:25.695 --> 24:26.930
We didn't anticipate this
would be

24:26.963 --> 24:30.067
a generational match up.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.804
Kate skewed the numbers,
royally.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.605
And when pitted against...

24:38.276 --> 24:40.077
It wasn't even a real contest.

24:40.111 --> 24:43.815
But, like you said, we only
did this for the name ID.

24:43.847 --> 24:44.648
You'll be ready next time.

24:44.682 --> 24:46.852
Yeah, but I was ready this
time.

24:48.752 --> 24:50.020
Thanks girls.

24:50.054 --> 24:51.823
Yeah, go get them, you look
fabulous!

24:51.855 --> 24:54.192
Yeah, we're back in The White
House, it's gonna happen.

24:54.224 --> 24:55.092
Look who just went out.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.994
Oh, they are so close to
calling it.

24:57.028 --> 24:58.930
Isn't there something we can
do to stop the hemorrhaging?

24:58.962 --> 25:02.767
I mean, we still have
California, right?

25:02.799 --> 25:04.134
Anything I can do to help?

25:06.170 --> 25:07.005
- Come on, one more, one more.
- The polls are closed

25:07.038 --> 25:08.205
across the nation,

25:08.239 --> 25:10.240
and it looks as though Taylor
Brooks has won reelection.

25:15.211 --> 25:18.249
Oh my gosh!

25:36.701 --> 25:37.836
Grandfather?

25:39.670 --> 25:41.006
She did it, look.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.741
It looks like you have a second
chance.

25:44.775 --> 25:45.810
You should take it.

25:45.843 --> 25:46.945
I don't know, Gieselle,

25:46.978 --> 25:47.812
you reach a certain age

25:47.846 --> 25:49.846
and second chances are harder to
come by.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.749
But you're holding one,

25:51.781 --> 25:54.184
and all you have to do is make
it happen.

25:54.218 --> 25:56.721
Yes, but I've told you though,

25:56.753 --> 25:58.755
it's more complicated than that.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.157
She doesn't know the whole
truth.

26:00.191 --> 26:02.192
She thinks that I am something I
am not.

26:02.893 --> 26:05.596
Well, then you go and tell
her.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.999
And you're going to need this.

26:09.366 --> 26:11.603
Oh, my darling, were it so
simple.

26:12.303 --> 26:15.139
You see, we have a deal
pending with the United States

26:15.172 --> 26:17.240
and if I go uninvited,

26:17.273 --> 26:20.077
they may feel pressured
and choose not to proceed.

26:20.912 --> 26:25.817
Grandfather, I hate to
be the bearer of bad news,

26:25.849 --> 26:27.751
but you aren't getting any
younger.

26:27.785 --> 26:28.720
Thank you.

26:28.752 --> 26:31.722
You pretended before,
you can do it again.

26:34.090 --> 26:34.992
My sweet gal.

26:41.398 --> 26:42.766
First meeting of the day.

26:42.799 --> 26:45.636
Great, hey, what's the protest
about?

26:45.670 --> 26:47.138
We never had that when Alex was
around.

26:47.171 --> 26:49.774
Oh, yeah, the guard says
they're here every night.

26:49.807 --> 26:51.241
- Hm.
- They seem peaceful enough,

26:51.275 --> 26:53.979
but it really looks like
they're having a good time.

26:54.944 --> 26:55.846
Get a job.

26:59.349 --> 27:02.052
Hey, lady, you dropped
something.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.855
Oh, well, thank you very much.

27:08.792 --> 27:09.793
What's your name?

27:09.826 --> 27:10.694
Hank.

27:12.296 --> 27:13.664
Do you work around here?

27:13.698 --> 27:16.701
Mostly, but I move around.

27:16.733 --> 27:18.970
Oh, well, how unique.

27:19.002 --> 27:19.670
Well, thanks again, Hank.

27:19.703 --> 27:21.204
Really appreciate all your help,

27:21.238 --> 27:24.174
and if I can ever be of
assistance, let me know.

27:25.142 --> 27:27.178
Do you work near here?

27:30.714 --> 27:34.151
I wouldn't call it work
as much as just helping out.

27:34.184 --> 27:36.721
Yeah, that's what I do.

27:37.454 --> 27:38.756
I just help out.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.025
Catch you later, Mrs. Morales.

27:41.057 --> 27:42.760
Okay, Hank, bye.

27:49.933 --> 27:51.435
Gentlemen.

27:51.469 --> 27:52.303
Good afternoon, your majesty,

27:52.336 --> 27:53.404
I wanted to come brief you in
person

27:53.438 --> 27:56.441
about a call I just received
from the new president.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.442
This has to do with the
arrangement

27:58.476 --> 28:00.745
that we had with President
Morales?

28:00.778 --> 28:02.380
It looks as though it died
with him.

28:02.413 --> 28:03.881
This can't be.

28:03.913 --> 28:04.981
We had his word,

28:05.015 --> 28:07.384
which I assumed was binding
on all who followed him.

28:07.417 --> 28:10.721
Unfortunately, that's not
how democracies work, sir.

28:10.755 --> 28:14.225
Each president sets his own
agenda, his own administration.

28:14.258 --> 28:16.227
He's not bound by his
predecessor at all.

28:16.259 --> 28:20.230
I understand, but we
have so many obligations

28:20.263 --> 28:23.300
relying on the completion of
this project.

28:23.334 --> 28:25.737
Without his support, sir, it
won't be.

28:28.204 --> 28:31.475
Does the new First
Lady have any influence?

28:31.509 --> 28:33.243
Not like the queen had with
you,

28:33.277 --> 28:35.779
if that's what you mean, sir?

28:35.813 --> 28:38.783
Many say he was only elected
because of her popularity.

28:38.816 --> 28:42.120
So you are saying that
she has no power now?

28:42.153 --> 28:43.087
Not like before.

28:52.296 --> 28:54.398
Get the U.S. embassy on the
phone.

28:54.431 --> 28:56.834
Ambassador Richardson,
specifically.

28:56.866 --> 28:57.735
Yes, of course.

28:59.068 --> 28:59.937
Thank you.

29:02.205 --> 29:03.006
Buttons!

29:03.039 --> 29:04.509
Woop.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.811
You know that's not how it
works, Jack.

29:09.212 --> 29:10.949
Because I've told you 50 times.

29:11.915 --> 29:14.152
I don't know how many
ways I can tell you no,

29:14.184 --> 29:16.186
so I'm just gonna hang up on you
now.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.054
All right.

29:17.086 --> 29:18.355
Hello?

29:18.388 --> 29:19.423
Yes.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.491
It's time for you to
pick your foreign intern.

29:20.523 --> 29:22.325
State sent these over.

29:22.358 --> 29:24.028
No, we will absolutely be
there,

29:24.060 --> 29:26.196
and I really appreciate your
help.

29:26.230 --> 29:27.999
Thank you so much.

29:28.031 --> 29:30.201
Yeah, we're looking forward to
it.

29:30.233 --> 29:31.168
Thank you so much.

29:31.201 --> 29:32.470
Baily.

29:32.502 --> 29:33.471
Yeah?

29:33.503 --> 29:34.571
Oh, thank you.

29:34.605 --> 29:37.909
So idea, what if we said no to
State?

29:37.942 --> 29:40.111
We all know these
interns are a royal pain.

29:40.144 --> 29:44.915
Well, speaking of royal
pain, she chose a princess.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.983
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

29:46.016 --> 29:47.183
Yeah.

29:47.217 --> 29:49.453
Oh, wait, wait, wait, they're
all princesses these days.

29:49.486 --> 29:50.822
- True, but-
- No.

29:50.855 --> 29:51.756
She really chose a princess.

29:51.789 --> 29:53.391
Well, it's an entitlement
generation.

29:53.423 --> 29:56.160
No, no, no, she is a princess.

29:56.192 --> 29:59.596
It says her specialties
are computer programming

29:59.630 --> 30:01.499
and martial arts.

30:01.531 --> 30:03.366
Yippee!

30:03.400 --> 30:05.336
We're gonna
have a ninja princess.

30:08.404 --> 30:10.141
Oh, Channing, before you go,

30:10.941 --> 30:13.144
check out this seating
chart for the next dinner.

30:13.176 --> 30:15.145
I don't want her next to him,

30:15.179 --> 30:18.382
but maybe two seats down so
he can keep an eye on her?

30:18.414 --> 30:19.817
She'd be perfect for him.

30:20.484 --> 30:22.285
You've only been back for two
weeks,

30:22.318 --> 30:24.454
you're already replacing
yourself?

30:24.488 --> 30:27.057
We both know this isn't
permanent.

30:27.090 --> 30:30.160
I just needed to keep my promise
to Alex,

30:30.193 --> 30:32.062
and keep Mallory from destroying

30:32.096 --> 30:33.565
the dignity of the position.

30:34.332 --> 30:38.069
Duty called, and I don't
think I'm the right answer.

30:38.102 --> 30:40.571
You look up First
Lady in the dictionary,

30:40.604 --> 30:42.573
there's a photo of you next to
it.

30:42.605 --> 30:44.975
This should be a lifetime
appointment.

30:48.412 --> 30:51.415
It just feels different
this time without Alex.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.253
It feels like I'm just
pretending this time,

30:55.286 --> 30:56.287
just playing a role.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.224
Your majesty, I'm not
sure this is gonna work

31:00.257 --> 31:01.659
in another country.

31:01.692 --> 31:04.161
Nonsense, even my own
people don't recognize me

31:04.193 --> 31:05.328
when I'm out amongst them.

31:05.362 --> 31:08.199
I've gotten that good at my
disguises over the years.

31:08.231 --> 31:09.966
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, sir,

31:10.000 --> 31:11.535
but your people love

31:11.567 --> 31:13.237
when you walk amongst them in
disguises.

31:13.269 --> 31:14.638
That is not possible.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.539
Is someone telling them?

31:16.573 --> 31:20.478
I believe it is your
entourage and your shoes.

31:20.510 --> 31:21.678
They're always spotless.

31:21.711 --> 31:23.114
Perfect, this!

31:23.146 --> 31:25.015
Here we go, that's perfect.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.319
What do they say in America?

31:29.987 --> 31:31.555
Straight trip!

31:31.587 --> 31:34.959
I believe that is
road trip, your majesty.

31:34.991 --> 31:36.259
Road trip?

31:36.292 --> 31:37.928
Huh.

31:47.503 --> 31:48.404
Gentlemen.

31:48.439 --> 31:50.007
Your Highness, I have arranged
for a car

31:50.039 --> 31:51.675
to pick you up at the airport in
D.C.

31:51.709 --> 31:52.910
It will take you to the house

31:52.943 --> 31:55.445
the State Department has prepared
to protect your identity.

31:55.479 --> 31:56.413
Very well.

31:56.446 --> 31:58.615
Your majesty, are you
sure this is the way

31:58.648 --> 32:00.283
you would like to proceed?

32:00.317 --> 32:01.585
What if you are discovered?

32:01.617 --> 32:03.520
Wouldn't that undermine your
agreement?

32:03.554 --> 32:06.390
That agreement died
with President Morales.

32:06.423 --> 32:08.326
If I have to go as myself, as
king,

32:10.227 --> 32:13.230
it would be a breach of
protocol perceived as coercion.

32:13.262 --> 32:15.465
No, I shall go as the lowly
guard

32:15.499 --> 32:17.634
that we have selected, sorry.

32:17.667 --> 32:18.735
Why all the secrecy?

32:18.769 --> 32:21.105
Why can't he go to see her as
himself?

32:21.137 --> 32:22.639
There's too much at stake.

32:22.673 --> 32:25.343
See, if he allows himself to be
exposed,

32:25.375 --> 32:26.477
then she could reject him

32:26.509 --> 32:27.979
and it could look like he's
trying

32:28.011 --> 32:30.147
to get her to help
resurrect the agreement.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.350
Will she not recognize him?

32:33.317 --> 32:34.617
It's fear too.

32:34.651 --> 32:35.519
What if she's changed?

32:35.551 --> 32:36.519
What if the spark is gone?

32:36.553 --> 32:39.390
He would put himself out
there and look foolish.

32:41.025 --> 32:44.162
I think it's brilliant, and I
get to play.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.769
Your majesty, I must say

32:52.803 --> 32:55.706
it is a pleasure to meet
you in person finally.

32:55.739 --> 32:57.674
Your story is a legend at the
embassy.

32:57.708 --> 33:00.711
Oh, it's good to meet you as
well, Ambassador Richardson.

33:00.743 --> 33:02.579
Which story? There are so many.

33:04.615 --> 33:07.250
Apparently, our fathers were
friends.

33:07.284 --> 33:10.153
They did a lot of things off the
record.

33:10.186 --> 33:13.556
Tom Edwards, yes, yes,
that was chapter one.

33:13.589 --> 33:17.227
I do hope with this trip
we can finish the story.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.230
We're all pulling for you,
sir.

33:19.262 --> 33:20.463
Here are your documents.

33:20.497 --> 33:23.601
Visas, ID, contact information.

33:25.201 --> 33:27.270
We've taken care of the rest,
thank you.

33:28.739 --> 33:29.740
Thank you, sir.

33:31.174 --> 33:32.475
Your majesty, while you're on
the plane,

33:32.509 --> 33:34.778
Dimitri will help you with your
costume

33:34.811 --> 33:37.380
and he will coach you on your
role.

33:37.413 --> 33:38.648
But of course.

33:38.682 --> 33:41.051
It'd be a good start
if you stopped bowing.

33:42.185 --> 33:45.388
Stop bowing, what is this?

33:45.422 --> 33:46.524
Very good.

33:46.557 --> 33:47.424
You may now bow.

33:55.665 --> 33:57.434
Everyone freeze.

33:57.468 --> 34:00.238
Grandfather, this is lesson one.

34:01.838 --> 34:02.706
Fine.

34:04.474 --> 34:05.842
Uh-uh.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.677
You must now hold it open for me

34:07.711 --> 34:09.313
and anyone else following you.

34:14.851 --> 34:16.719
Stop bowing, stop it.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.092
Don't!

34:29.733 --> 34:31.302
- Your majesty.
- Yes?

34:31.335 --> 34:32.436
Just pretend like you're on
the streets

34:32.469 --> 34:34.237
of Moldovanique in disguise,

34:34.271 --> 34:35.239
but lose the shoes.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.741
Did you pack my brandy and my
coffee?

34:38.775 --> 34:40.811
If I am to dress less than
royal,

34:40.844 --> 34:42.679
at least I can drink like a
king.

34:42.713 --> 34:43.714
Of course.

34:43.746 --> 34:44.748
Good luck, your Highness.

34:44.780 --> 34:46.683
There's a bet back at the
embassy.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.251
Big money is on you.

34:48.284 --> 34:50.420
Ah, but my money is on love.

35:13.610 --> 35:14.612
Thank you.

35:22.219 --> 35:23.287
Oh, whoa!

35:23.320 --> 35:24.321
That was her.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.523
I can't believe we
didn't even recognize her.

35:26.556 --> 35:28.725
I was looking at my phone
and didn't even see her!

35:28.759 --> 35:30.494
What? What just happened?

35:33.329 --> 35:35.398
George Washington laid the
cornerstone

35:35.431 --> 35:36.332
for The White House,

35:36.367 --> 35:38.469
but it was actually Abigail and
John Adams

35:38.501 --> 35:40.471
who were the first residents.

35:40.503 --> 35:42.472
Oh, I am so sorry.

35:42.505 --> 35:44.608
You look lost, may I help you?

35:45.809 --> 35:46.677
This?

35:47.411 --> 35:49.813
And what are you expecting
to find in that office?

35:49.846 --> 35:51.282
The princess.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.416
I was told the princess is in
this office.

35:53.449 --> 35:55.785
Oh, I've been called many
things,

35:55.818 --> 35:58.788
but princess tops the list.

35:58.822 --> 36:01.525
But yeah, that is my office.

36:01.557 --> 36:02.927
So you have met the princess?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.260
Max?

36:04.293 --> 36:06.196
Ah, yes, there you are.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.365
You are not to be wandering
these halls alone.

36:08.398 --> 36:09.533
It is far too dangerous.

36:09.565 --> 36:12.702
And what is it about the
security of The White House

36:12.735 --> 36:15.471
that makes her adventure
down the hall so dangerous?

36:15.505 --> 36:18.209
I have been assigned to
protect Princess Gieselle.

36:18.909 --> 36:22.313
She's to be with an armed
bodyguard at all times.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.181
Yeah, follow me.

36:28.251 --> 36:29.452
And she knows it.

36:32.322 --> 36:33.323
I can assure you,

36:33.356 --> 36:35.759
she is in one of the
safest places in the world

36:35.791 --> 36:37.728
with or without a bodyguard.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.862
And I must have missed the fine
print from State Department.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.632
I don't recall seeing anything
about

36:41.664 --> 36:43.000
the princess needing a
bodyguard,

36:43.032 --> 36:45.335
which as I said, she does not.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.472
It was an explicit
condition of her service.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.407
Someone must have mentioned it.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.376
I did not see one armed
guard in that hallway.

36:54.177 --> 36:57.347
It is what you don't
see that protects her.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.716
This is not a police
state with armed guards

36:59.750 --> 37:03.487
around every corner, like
many countries in the world.

37:03.519 --> 37:05.755
And if the Secret Service
feels our president

37:05.789 --> 37:07.958
is safe to walk these dangerous
hallways,

37:07.990 --> 37:10.628
then certainly so is our
princess.

37:10.661 --> 37:14.365
Oh, besides I've heard that
she's a martial artist.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.033
Can't she protect herself?

37:16.065 --> 37:18.701
Yes, but to use it in another
country

37:18.735 --> 37:20.037
could create liability issues

37:20.070 --> 37:21.705
and a potential international
incident.

37:21.737 --> 37:23.673
Huh, yes.

37:23.706 --> 37:25.608
Could you just sit in the
hallway?

37:25.641 --> 37:26.542
Just by the door?

37:26.576 --> 37:28.045
There are so many windows.

37:28.077 --> 37:30.614
I cannot protect her from the
outside

37:30.646 --> 37:32.782
when she is here, inside.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.784
And those hoodlums outside-

37:34.818 --> 37:36.954
- The protestors?

37:36.987 --> 37:38.155
They seem very dangerous.

37:38.188 --> 37:41.825
Trust me, they are no more
dangerous than a paper cut.

37:41.858 --> 37:43.894
Okay, things are clearly
very cramped here already.

37:43.927 --> 37:46.363
The only thing we can offer
you is by the coffee machine.

37:47.364 --> 37:48.132
That's fine.

37:48.164 --> 37:51.032
No, in fact, that will be
perfect.

37:51.034 --> 37:53.436
I shall prepare you a splendid

37:53.469 --> 37:54.937
cup of coffee from my country.

37:54.971 --> 37:56.873
I just require waters for it.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.609
Sorry, sir, wait.

37:58.641 --> 37:59.777
That would be you.

37:59.809 --> 38:00.643
Oh, I can help with-

38:00.677 --> 38:01.545
- No, no, dear.

38:02.679 --> 38:04.315
I can handle this task.

38:04.347 --> 38:06.916
No job is too small or too big.

38:07.818 --> 38:08.686
Thank you.

38:12.989 --> 38:15.826
Next they're gonna bring
their nannies and cooks.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.694
He doesn't look like he could
guard

38:17.728 --> 38:20.364
his way out of a fallen souffle.

38:20.396 --> 38:22.865
I mean, what danger does he
think she could possibly be in?

38:22.898 --> 38:24.034
This is absurd.

38:30.373 --> 38:31.507
Oh, in the-

38:31.541 --> 38:32.643
- Tap it?

38:32.675 --> 38:33.943
The wet pedal.

38:41.284 --> 38:44.054
Magnificent, that is very
clever.

38:44.086 --> 38:46.456
I can use my foot and my hand.

38:46.489 --> 38:47.924
We must remember this.

38:51.027 --> 38:52.695
You sure she's the right one?

38:52.728 --> 38:54.097
She didn't recognize you,
grandfather.

38:54.130 --> 38:56.966
Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.436
It's that same fire, that same
spirit.

38:59.469 --> 39:00.971
I saw it the moment I walked in.

39:02.639 --> 39:04.575
Obviously, she didn't see it
in you.

39:05.275 --> 39:08.979
Well, would you recognize me?

39:11.514 --> 39:13.549
You never showed me this.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.753
Oh my goodness, that's her?

39:16.786 --> 39:17.587
That's you?

39:17.621 --> 39:19.856
She mustn't know until I'm
ready.

39:20.956 --> 39:22.125
I need to know for sure.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.498
Thank you so much.

39:27.530 --> 39:28.833
Thank you.

39:29.699 --> 39:31.568
Thanks for your support.

39:31.601 --> 39:33.804
We're counting on your votes.

39:33.836 --> 39:34.637
I'm looking forward to serving

39:34.670 --> 39:37.807
as your president and First
Lady.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.509
To promises kept.

39:42.211 --> 39:43.079
Who is it?

39:44.079 --> 39:45.815
It's me, Taylor.

39:45.849 --> 39:46.684
Come in.

39:49.552 --> 39:50.186
Hi.

39:50.219 --> 39:51.788
Hi.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.459
I just needed a soft
landing after a hard day.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.929
But it's late, so we can talk
tomorrow.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.030
No, no, no.

40:00.063 --> 40:02.566
I was just going through
some old videos and things.

40:06.068 --> 40:09.972
They keep harping on the
bill that I voted on years ago,

40:10.005 --> 40:12.074
that has since been repealed.

40:12.108 --> 40:14.044
What part of irrelevant don't
they get?

40:22.751 --> 40:24.121
I know that's frustrating,
huh?

40:24.153 --> 40:25.021
Yeah.

40:26.155 --> 40:27.891
It's kind of like this
plastic.

40:31.161 --> 40:34.130
You can try to pressure
people to see things your way,

40:34.164 --> 40:37.634
but the harder you press and
pull,

40:37.666 --> 40:39.836
the more tension you create.

40:39.869 --> 40:42.739
But if you cut the tension...

40:50.579 --> 40:53.049
Try humor with humility.

40:53.849 --> 40:57.820
It'll disarm your opponent, and
then they'll see your point.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.522
I love the tie, though.

41:02.659 --> 41:04.126
You and Alex were an
incredible team,

41:04.159 --> 41:07.030
like two legs in the same pair
of pants.

41:10.233 --> 41:11.235
I had that once.

41:14.570 --> 41:15.672
Without Annie,

41:17.773 --> 41:20.810
I just seem untethered
sometimes.

41:22.579 --> 41:24.882
Yeah, I know what you mean.

41:24.914 --> 41:27.016
Oh, I'm so sorry, of course,
you do.

41:27.050 --> 41:28.018
- No, no.
- Listen to me go on.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.786
No, no, no, no, it's natural.

41:30.820 --> 41:31.653
It's natural to want someone

41:31.688 --> 41:33.891
to share these special moments
with.

41:35.759 --> 41:37.860
And I actually have someone very
special

41:37.893 --> 41:38.828
that I want you to meet.

41:38.862 --> 41:40.230
She's coming to the
Wounded Veterans dinner

41:40.262 --> 41:41.096
in two weeks and she's amazing.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.199
- Kate, Kate.
- Wait til you meet her,

41:43.233 --> 41:44.835
- she'd be perfect for you.
- Kate!

41:44.867 --> 41:45.835
What?

41:45.869 --> 41:48.639
I don't need another
First Lady, I have you.

41:48.672 --> 41:49.840
Mm-hmm.

41:49.873 --> 41:54.677
Besides, dating would be
too distracting right now, so.

41:55.945 --> 41:56.947
Keep an open mind.

42:10.226 --> 42:12.329
Okay, let's get this done.

42:12.362 --> 42:13.697
I mean, what's this all about?

42:13.730 --> 42:16.166
Seriously, not holding a door
open?

42:16.199 --> 42:17.233
What's that about?

42:18.835 --> 42:22.338
Oh, Charlie, why don't you
come with us?

42:22.371 --> 42:24.240
You'll enjoy this, won't she?

42:36.686 --> 42:37.821
- Kate?
- Mm-hmm.

42:37.853 --> 42:38.955
The kids are here, would
you like me to let them in?

42:38.989 --> 42:39.856
Oh, yeah.

42:43.393 --> 42:44.260
Welcome.

42:45.228 --> 42:46.230
Come in gentlemen,

42:50.032 --> 42:51.034
and lady.

42:52.034 --> 42:53.869
I'm glad you brought a friend.

42:53.902 --> 42:54.771
Have a seat.

42:57.840 --> 43:01.144
I'm sure you're all
wondering why you're here.

43:02.778 --> 43:03.847
Oh, that was really cool.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.148
I didn't know anything about
the origins of chivalry.

43:06.181 --> 43:08.117
Yeah, I've already downloaded
the book.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.885
Thanks for letting me come
with you.

43:09.918 --> 43:10.953
Yeah, that was fun.

43:10.987 --> 43:12.222
When's the next one, right?

43:12.255 --> 43:13.090
- Yeah.
- I was worried

43:13.123 --> 43:14.023
when you started groaning.

43:16.059 --> 43:17.928
That was magnificent.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.129
You seem to know your history.

43:20.163 --> 43:21.632
You should be a teacher.

43:22.599 --> 43:24.701
I was a history
professor before my husband

43:24.733 --> 43:26.002
decided to run for office.

43:26.902 --> 43:28.038
Oh, and I do miss it.

43:28.070 --> 43:29.271
Well, you're very good at it.

43:29.306 --> 43:32.643
Perhaps when you're finished
here, you can get back to it.

43:32.675 --> 43:33.811
Yeah, I don't know.

43:33.844 --> 43:37.748
You get to a certain age,
it's hard to get a do-over.

43:37.780 --> 43:40.617
But aren't you getting one
now?

43:44.153 --> 43:47.724
You can't go back and
recapture lost dreams.

43:47.757 --> 43:50.793
Yeah, for me, this was a promise
I made.

43:51.693 --> 43:54.731
I don't know now that
Taylor's in office...

43:56.432 --> 43:59.302
I wish I knew what these kids
want.

43:59.335 --> 44:00.936
They just sit there all day.

44:00.969 --> 44:03.673
Yeah, like it's their mom's
basement.

44:03.706 --> 44:05.442
They break for lunch around
12:00

44:05.474 --> 44:07.844
and they're back by three.

44:07.876 --> 44:09.679
What kind of work day is that?

44:09.713 --> 44:12.382
They need to throw
themselves into their cause,

44:12.414 --> 44:13.884
whatever it is.

44:13.916 --> 44:15.652
Yeah, it's debit cards.

44:16.719 --> 44:18.754
Hmm, who would pay kids to
protest?

44:18.788 --> 44:20.056
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

44:20.891 --> 44:23.927
Sergeant McLean, we've
spoken several times.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.295
It's such a pleasure to meet
you.

44:25.327 --> 44:26.829
Nice to meet you.

44:26.862 --> 44:28.998
Look's like we're gonna
have a good turnout.

44:29.032 --> 44:31.001
Yeah, it's gonna be a
wonderful evening.

44:31.034 --> 44:32.936
And I've spoken to your protocol
officer

44:32.969 --> 44:33.737
and we just wanna make sure

44:33.769 --> 44:35.706
everything's up to your
standard.

44:35.739 --> 44:36.706
Well, from what I hear,

44:36.739 --> 44:38.442
Kathryn Morales is the
standard for protocol.

44:38.474 --> 44:39.909
You've heard correctly.

44:41.277 --> 44:43.813
Oh, there's Hank from the
other day.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.449
Okay, I get it.

44:45.481 --> 44:48.150
Yeah, he's a freelancer, oh,
very cute.

44:48.184 --> 44:49.018
Channing just texted.

44:49.052 --> 44:50.487
She's on her way up with
Sergeant McLean.

44:50.519 --> 44:52.021
Madam.

44:52.054 --> 44:53.355
Thank you, Max.

44:53.389 --> 44:54.858
Great, I'll go get him.

44:56.391 --> 44:57.393
Show her now.

44:57.427 --> 44:59.829
You just heard her,
she's ready for a change.

44:59.862 --> 45:04.100
My darling, when the time
is right, I will know it.

45:05.534 --> 45:06.368
Hey, Max.

45:06.402 --> 45:07.202
Hmm?

45:07.235 --> 45:08.270
Can you take this to Kate
please?

45:08.304 --> 45:10.740
She's headed to the East
Wing with Sergeant McLean.

45:10.773 --> 45:11.974
You can meet her in the lobby.

45:12.007 --> 45:12.942
I'd be happy to help.

45:12.976 --> 45:13.809
Great.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.746
I assume the princess will be
safe.

45:17.547 --> 45:18.414
Seriously?

45:20.215 --> 45:21.085
Come on.

45:26.489 --> 45:29.259
Do you know
how valuable that plate was?

45:30.226 --> 45:33.062
How many guests through the
generations

45:33.096 --> 45:34.298
have eaten off of it?

45:35.465 --> 45:38.869
It is irreplaceable, unlike you.

45:40.269 --> 45:41.338
I am so sorry.

45:45.175 --> 45:47.344
But some things can be replaced.

45:48.378 --> 45:51.749
Let's not put more value on
things than we do people.

45:59.188 --> 46:01.457
It's an honor doing
business with you, ma'am.

46:03.159 --> 46:06.061
Ah, Mrs. Morales, Ms. Channing
asked me

46:06.094 --> 46:07.196
to deliver this folder.

46:07.230 --> 46:08.532
I hope I'm not interrupting.

46:08.565 --> 46:10.400
Oh, Max, how thoughtful, thank
you.

46:10.432 --> 46:12.135
Max, meet Sergeant McLean.

46:12.168 --> 46:13.970
- Sir.
- Two handsome men in uniform.

46:14.003 --> 46:16.106
I'm sure you have a lot in
common.

46:16.139 --> 46:17.207
My honor, may I?

46:18.208 --> 46:19.076
Yeah.

46:26.916 --> 46:29.318
Grandfather, Channing has
asked us

46:29.351 --> 46:31.387
to help her with the dinner
party prep.

46:31.420 --> 46:34.423
Well, she asked me, which means
you.

46:34.456 --> 46:36.826
This is why I'm here, to
observe.

46:36.860 --> 46:37.795
I still can't believe

46:37.827 --> 46:39.996
there's nothing about you she
recognizes.

46:40.028 --> 46:42.865
I don't even recognize myself
in these horrible clothes,

46:42.898 --> 46:46.269
and my wonderful full
head of hair, woo, gone.

46:48.204 --> 46:49.306
Put your hat back on.

46:53.610 --> 46:54.477
Mrs. Morales.

46:54.510 --> 46:55.411
Yeah?

46:55.445 --> 46:58.148
This is Madison, she is
another intern.

46:58.181 --> 46:59.548
Oh, Madison.

46:59.581 --> 47:01.417
Oh, how brilliant that
your parents would name you

47:01.451 --> 47:03.186
for one of the most important
presidents

47:03.219 --> 47:05.021
in American history.

47:05.054 --> 47:07.624
And his wife, Dolly, amazing
woman.

47:07.657 --> 47:09.226
You know, she helped save The
White House

47:09.259 --> 47:11.494
from total destruction by the
British.

47:11.527 --> 47:13.563
She rescued several historic
paintings,

47:13.596 --> 47:16.833
including that Stuart
portrait of Washington.

47:17.634 --> 47:19.869
What a wonderful namesake for
you to have.

47:19.902 --> 47:21.971
Actually, they named me after
a mermaid.

47:25.141 --> 47:26.276
A mermaid?

47:26.309 --> 47:28.612
I don't suppose she's seen
many movies.

47:30.246 --> 47:31.146
Huh?

47:31.181 --> 47:32.949
So you will have an updated
list soon.

47:32.981 --> 47:34.182
Okay.

47:34.217 --> 47:37.052
The ambassador left a hole
and Williams is the wild card.

47:39.222 --> 47:41.091
Wouldn't it be nice
at some point in my life

47:41.123 --> 47:44.660
to have a dinner party for
people I actually like?

47:44.693 --> 47:47.529
why do you do it if you don't
enjoy it?

47:47.563 --> 47:50.233
You have plenty of staff.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.469
I didn't say I didn't enjoy
it.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.572
It's the battlefield for me.

47:55.605 --> 47:58.173
The ultimate war game.

47:58.206 --> 48:00.509
You think about all the
normal conversations

48:00.543 --> 48:01.945
that happen around the dinner
table

48:01.978 --> 48:04.014
and then eject that from your
mind

48:04.047 --> 48:07.284
and picture the table at the
DMZ.

48:07.317 --> 48:09.452
But instead of a line of
microphones down the middle,

48:09.485 --> 48:12.222
I have a beautiful centerpiece.

48:12.255 --> 48:14.990
Well, get your battle gear on.

48:15.023 --> 48:16.359
The Carrington's are coming.

48:18.193 --> 48:19.262
They're like a virus.

48:20.195 --> 48:21.498
More like a rash.

48:21.530 --> 48:22.398
Yep.

48:36.378 --> 48:39.583
Good to see you, Kate.

48:45.121 --> 48:45.989
Watch her.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.725
She's like an NFL quarterback

48:48.757 --> 48:51.661
making a perfect pass
to the next receiver.

48:53.528 --> 48:54.630
Every time.

48:56.532 --> 49:00.269
Yes, she is regal.

49:02.704 --> 49:04.673
Ah, Senator Carrington.

49:04.706 --> 49:05.541
Kate.

49:05.574 --> 49:06.542
And Mallory.

49:06.576 --> 49:07.376
Hello, Kate.

49:07.409 --> 49:08.377
What a pleasure to see you
both.

49:08.411 --> 49:12.148
What a lovely setting,
so much youthful energy.

49:13.250 --> 49:16.686
Do take care of yourself,
you're looking a little tired.

49:17.653 --> 49:21.157
Do you know Congressman
and Mrs. McMillan?

49:21.190 --> 49:23.259
You will love getting to know
one another.

49:23.291 --> 49:24.226
Senator.

49:24.260 --> 49:26.629
Always a pleasure,
we just so appreciate.

49:26.661 --> 49:29.465
Your support always means so
much.

49:29.498 --> 49:30.399
You look really nice tonight.

49:30.434 --> 49:33.003
Well, you clean up pretty nice
yourself.

49:34.536 --> 49:37.573
We appreciate it so much.

49:37.606 --> 49:38.708
Thank you.

49:38.742 --> 49:41.311
Sergeant McLean, it is an
honor to finally meet you.

49:41.344 --> 49:43.346
The honor is all mine, sir.

49:43.378 --> 49:45.114
I can't thank you enough
for putting this dinner

49:45.148 --> 49:45.782
on for all of us.

49:45.815 --> 49:47.184
We were happy to do it.

49:47.951 --> 49:50.586
Sergeant McLean, we
appreciate you so much.

49:54.791 --> 49:58.628
Oh, oh, there she is, the
brunette in the blue dress

49:58.661 --> 49:59.596
by the door.

49:59.628 --> 50:03.032
Her name's Carrie, be nice.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.369
I'm always nice.

50:10.338 --> 50:13.175
The young governor of
Virginia, Mr. Parkmay.

50:13.208 --> 50:13.876
It's pleasure, sir.

50:13.909 --> 50:14.877
Pleasure to meet you as well.

50:14.911 --> 50:17.280
Keep that seat warm, I
might be in it one day.

50:17.313 --> 50:19.383
There you go, I hope so.

50:21.617 --> 50:23.319
So good to see you.

50:23.351 --> 50:25.021
Nice to meet you.

50:27.456 --> 50:31.293
Hello, Carrie, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

50:31.327 --> 50:32.295
No, it's Cameron.

50:32.327 --> 50:36.298
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
under the impression...

50:37.266 --> 50:41.304
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Cameron.

50:41.336 --> 50:42.271
Likewise.

50:48.376 --> 50:49.311
Hello!

51:12.135 --> 51:13.603
Good evening, everyone.

51:13.635 --> 51:16.639
President Brooks and I welcome
you to The White House.

51:16.672 --> 51:18.108
We are so delighted you're here.

51:18.141 --> 51:19.843
We hope you have a wonderful
evening.

51:21.409 --> 51:24.246
Well, we all know the
importance of staying in shape,

51:24.280 --> 51:27.517
eating right, taking our
vitamins.

51:27.550 --> 51:30.120
You just never know when your
time's up.

51:30.152 --> 51:34.757
Your time will be up if
you don't lower your voice.

51:35.891 --> 51:37.359
Well, what's so wrong about
talking

51:37.393 --> 51:40.530
about staying healthy, and
alive.

51:41.230 --> 51:43.666
She would have been a
disaster.

51:43.699 --> 51:45.135
I'm sitting right here!

51:52.307 --> 51:53.175
Hi.

51:53.208 --> 51:54.210
Who's Cameron?

51:56.311 --> 51:59.748
I am fascinated by your
position on the fortress bill,

51:59.782 --> 52:02.684
although, with all due respect,

52:02.717 --> 52:05.154
you're totally wrong in
your arguments for it.

52:05.188 --> 52:07.323
Well, we all know what that
means.

52:07.356 --> 52:09.359
What's that?

52:09.391 --> 52:10.926
"With all due respect."

52:10.960 --> 52:13.596
It's a polite way of saying
someone's full of it,

52:13.628 --> 52:15.565
with all due respect.

52:18.333 --> 52:19.536
That is Cameron Cooper.

52:20.503 --> 52:22.705
DHS Secretary sent is late,

52:22.737 --> 52:24.373
so she's the Under Secretary.

52:28.911 --> 52:31.181
I cannot believe that
Kate put us at the other end

52:31.213 --> 52:33.615
of the table when Preston
clearly said

52:33.648 --> 52:35.518
we would be seated next to
Taylor.

52:35.550 --> 52:36.920
You better watch your back with
that one.

52:36.952 --> 52:38.420
Don't be so hard on her.

52:38.454 --> 52:40.757
I mean, put yourself in her
shoes.

52:40.789 --> 52:42.759
Yeah, well, those were
my Antonio Bellini's

52:42.791 --> 52:43.726
she was wearing.

52:44.427 --> 52:45.862
I actually thought she was
pretty cool

52:45.894 --> 52:47.597
about you being there.

52:47.630 --> 52:50.266
I can't believe you still use
Preston.

52:50.298 --> 52:52.802
Cameron, she cares more about
protocol

52:52.835 --> 52:54.036
than she does people.

52:54.070 --> 52:57.507
It is so stupid to think that
you can run for First Lady.

52:57.539 --> 52:58.775
She thinks she's a queen.

52:59.442 --> 53:03.179
That is not a job I
would wish on anyone.

53:04.447 --> 53:06.649
What a wonderful evening though.

53:06.681 --> 53:07.550
Ugh.

53:08.418 --> 53:09.686
Hey, when do you start your
new job?

53:09.719 --> 53:11.721
Are you so excited to get back
on TV?

53:12.722 --> 53:14.324
I'm excited to be anywhere

53:14.356 --> 53:16.326
I can destroy Kathryn Morales.

53:18.327 --> 53:19.429
Where's Harold?

53:20.362 --> 53:21.230
Harold!

53:27.369 --> 53:31.306
Hello, I don't know if
you remember me or not.

53:31.340 --> 53:33.009
The dinner the other night.

53:33.041 --> 53:34.076
How could I forget?

53:34.110 --> 53:36.479
The man that's belaboring
an amendment to a bill

53:36.512 --> 53:40.650
that is unnecessary and
basically gutting it.

53:40.682 --> 53:43.418
Yes, I remember you.

53:43.452 --> 53:45.388
Well, maybe we need to discuss

53:45.420 --> 53:48.857
the issue further since it's
obviously important to you.

53:50.793 --> 53:51.661
Can I call you?

53:52.795 --> 53:54.396
I'm sure you can.

53:54.429 --> 53:57.399
The question really is, may you
call me?

54:05.340 --> 54:06.942
I've already got her on speed
dial.

54:10.813 --> 54:11.981
Preston Walker's back.

54:12.648 --> 54:15.617
What part of no does he not
understand?

54:15.650 --> 54:16.952
And you're gonna love this.

54:19.454 --> 54:20.723
You've got to be kidding.

54:21.391 --> 54:23.059
What does Mallory Carrington
know

54:23.092 --> 54:25.394
about being a TV news reporter?

54:25.427 --> 54:26.563
What?

54:26.596 --> 54:29.032
She can't even string two
coherent sentences together.

54:29.065 --> 54:30.967
They must think she can read.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.635
Someone else writes it anyway.

54:32.668 --> 54:33.635
Yeah.

54:33.668 --> 54:34.836
Okay, seriously, what
does movies and music

54:34.869 --> 54:37.507
possibly have to do with news?

54:37.539 --> 54:38.340
And what about Preston?

54:38.373 --> 54:40.342
Should I let the little weasel
in?

54:40.376 --> 54:42.545
Yeah, be sure the litter box
is out.

54:42.577 --> 54:43.646
We have new carpet.

54:43.679 --> 54:44.814
Can we use that paper?

54:44.847 --> 54:45.782
Please.

54:52.521 --> 54:55.458
Kate, what is the decision
on the education bill?

54:55.490 --> 54:56.759
Is he gonna veto it or not?

54:56.791 --> 54:58.994
They don't waste much
time with pleasantries,

54:59.027 --> 55:02.764
commonly known as manners,
where you come from, do they?

55:02.797 --> 55:05.033
And I don't see anyone in this
room

55:05.067 --> 55:08.670
that you're familiar
enough with to call Kate.

55:08.704 --> 55:10.707
You don't need to pull that
First Lady shtick with me.

55:10.739 --> 55:13.342
Has he seen the protesters
outside?

55:13.376 --> 55:15.978
Oh, that's what they're
protesting.

55:16.010 --> 55:18.413
Skipped a few days of
Charm School, did we?

55:19.715 --> 55:22.352
She's getting under his skin.

55:22.385 --> 55:25.388
He's a little brown-noser
for his OCD senator.

55:26.121 --> 55:27.856
You're talking about Mr.
Carrington?

55:27.889 --> 55:30.592
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't he too slow to be OCD?

55:30.626 --> 55:31.995
No, no, it's Senator Stone.

55:32.961 --> 55:36.465
Preston is what we
politely call a consultant.

55:36.498 --> 55:38.800
He has his hand out to
whoever will put cash in it.

55:38.833 --> 55:41.069
He must be very careful.

55:41.103 --> 55:44.574
One day it could get bitten off.

55:44.606 --> 55:45.809
Watch a master at work.

55:46.576 --> 55:50.980
We need to know before the
bill vote, is he in or out?

55:51.012 --> 55:52.447
Preston, this is your lucky
day,

55:52.481 --> 55:55.985
because I'm feeling
particularly patronizing.

55:56.018 --> 55:58.121
Go tell Stone to do his job.

55:58.153 --> 55:59.989
Let President Brooks do his.

56:00.021 --> 56:01.456
Take the vote.

56:01.489 --> 56:02.824
Don't worry about a veto.

56:02.858 --> 56:06.095
If it's too close to get
an override, don't do it.

56:06.128 --> 56:09.030
But don't assume the president's
gonna do your job for you.

56:09.063 --> 56:11.634
Nothing about what you
just said makes me feel

56:11.666 --> 56:12.601
the least bit lucky.

56:12.635 --> 56:14.537
Oh, you are lucky,

56:14.570 --> 56:16.038
because I didn't throw
you out of my office

56:16.070 --> 56:18.974
before imparting my words of
wisdom.

56:19.007 --> 56:20.476
But now that I have.

56:30.686 --> 56:32.054
I cannot believe someone that
ill-mannered

56:32.086 --> 56:34.824
could ever represent a U.S.
senator!

56:34.856 --> 56:38.126
There was not even the
slightest pretense of respect.

56:38.159 --> 56:40.495
I mean, are good people
really that hard to find?

56:40.528 --> 56:43.900
Kate, seriously? Kate?

56:43.932 --> 56:45.067
How'd it go?

56:45.099 --> 56:48.136
I really, really hate her.

56:48.170 --> 56:50.139
Great, have a nice day.

56:51.474 --> 56:53.176
I'm getting very close, my
darling.

56:54.976 --> 56:58.847
Hey, we've got action in the
South 40.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.949
Finally, they've moved off the
dime.

57:02.083 --> 57:04.186
"We deserve to learn."

57:04.219 --> 57:06.822
Yeah, that's why we have public
schools.

57:06.856 --> 57:09.158
Look at that one,
"Education should be free."

57:09.190 --> 57:11.493
I guess they didn't get
the public school memo.

57:11.527 --> 57:13.596
This must be the bill
Preston was talking about.

57:13.628 --> 57:15.565
Oh, I found a cute one.

57:15.597 --> 57:19.469
"Don't take my brain away
before it's filled with..."

57:19.501 --> 57:21.737
Knowledge? Knowledge!

57:21.769 --> 57:23.806
Some of these kids need
some higher education

57:23.838 --> 57:27.043
because it cannot get
much lower than this.

57:27.076 --> 57:30.612
Get me the Secret Service,
and call extension 342,

57:30.646 --> 57:32.215
tell Frank I am on my way down.

57:33.282 --> 57:35.651
Gieselle, I really could
use your help on this.

57:35.684 --> 57:38.221
And you too, of course,
Max, if you don't mind.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.161
There's something going
on at The White House?

57:45.827 --> 57:48.663
Mallory, we have to go live
to The White House right now.

57:48.697 --> 57:49.599
Are you new?

57:49.632 --> 57:50.766
Yeah, because, guess what?

57:50.798 --> 57:52.701
I haven't had my latte, so, no.

57:56.606 --> 58:00.142
Action in three, two, one.

58:00.175 --> 58:01.911
We're going live to The White
House

58:01.943 --> 58:03.778
where there seems to be
a storming of the gates

58:03.811 --> 58:06.248
by protestors who have
been there for weeks.

58:07.148 --> 58:09.719
Yes, but it is friendly.

58:09.751 --> 58:11.253
It looks as though Kate Morales,

58:11.286 --> 58:13.555
who was elected First Lady last
November,

58:13.588 --> 58:17.226
is hosting what looks to
be a chocolate milk summit.

58:27.036 --> 58:28.137
Well, hi, Mrs Morales.

58:28.170 --> 58:29.137
Hey, Hank.

58:29.170 --> 58:30.272
You know, I've finally
figured out who you are.

58:30.306 --> 58:31.139
Yeah?

58:31.172 --> 58:32.007
It totally helped.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.276
Yeah, it generally does.

58:33.309 --> 58:34.110
Yes, ma'am.

58:34.143 --> 58:35.778
Hello, everybody, may I join
you?

58:35.811 --> 58:37.280
Of course, of course.

58:37.313 --> 58:39.148
I took the liberty of asking
the kitchen

58:39.181 --> 58:42.652
to whip up some chocolate milk
and chocolate chip cookies.

58:42.684 --> 58:44.019
I hope that's okay with you?

58:49.657 --> 58:51.894
What in the world is going on?

58:53.061 --> 58:54.297
Stop inside the gate.

58:55.097 --> 58:57.266
I want you to consider
The White House, your house.

58:57.298 --> 58:59.302
So we welcome you to the
grounds.

58:59.335 --> 59:02.804
And we're eager to hear your
concerns.

59:02.838 --> 59:06.208
We, here in The White House,
wanna serve you as best we can.

59:06.240 --> 59:08.277
And we wanna know what your
thoughts are,

59:08.309 --> 59:10.679
and your dreams and
visions for your future.

59:14.650 --> 59:17.954
Kate, what is this?

59:17.987 --> 59:19.188
Remember the plastic?

59:19.221 --> 59:20.755
Plastic?

59:20.789 --> 59:22.725
To cut the tension, use humor.

59:23.759 --> 59:24.594
Humor.

59:24.626 --> 59:25.827
Mm-hmm.

59:25.862 --> 59:27.997
And I guess we know who's
really running The White House.

59:28.030 --> 59:30.365
What do you think about all of
this?

59:30.398 --> 59:32.969
She should be president, she
gets it.

59:35.170 --> 59:37.139
You should be president.

59:37.172 --> 59:38.740
You get it.

59:38.773 --> 59:41.643
No, no, you could not
ask for a better president

59:41.677 --> 59:42.778
than Taylor Brooks.

59:43.512 --> 59:46.148
This really is one of
the most unusual events

59:46.181 --> 59:48.918
we have ever witnessed at The
White House.

59:48.951 --> 59:49.918
Cookie?

59:49.952 --> 59:52.755
But doesn't their view
on the education bill

59:52.788 --> 59:55.023
directly conflict with President
Brooks'?

59:55.056 --> 59:58.760
And doesn't that pit him and
Kathryn

59:58.793 --> 1:00:00.096
in a head-to-head battle?

1:00:00.128 --> 1:00:01.764
Did you know about this?

1:00:01.797 --> 1:00:03.898
No, sir, I am just
as surprised as anyone,

1:00:03.931 --> 1:00:05.367
including the Secret Service.

1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:06.402
Get them on the phone.

1:00:06.434 --> 1:00:08.237
I wanna know how I was
blindsided

1:00:08.269 --> 1:00:09.804
in the White House driveway

1:00:09.838 --> 1:00:11.173
without the benefit of a
briefing

1:00:11.206 --> 1:00:13.742
on an issue I clearly oppose.

1:00:13.775 --> 1:00:15.010
I'm on it, Mr President.

1:00:18.012 --> 1:00:18.880
Hello?

1:00:20.148 --> 1:00:20.982
Madam.

1:00:21.016 --> 1:00:21.684
Yes?

1:00:21.717 --> 1:00:24.686
You were wonderful last night.

1:00:24.719 --> 1:00:28.056
I'm sure the president
appreciates your gesture of peace.

1:00:28.090 --> 1:00:31.260
I brought you a very special
cup of my coffee to celebrate.

1:00:31.293 --> 1:00:33.329
Well, how thoughtful, thanks,
Max.

1:00:34.028 --> 1:00:36.831
Yes, I also wanted to share
with you

1:00:36.864 --> 1:00:38.233
this photo that-

1:00:38.266 --> 1:00:41.903
- Yes, no, I will be
there in five minutes.

1:00:41.936 --> 1:00:42.971
I'm on my way.

1:00:43.005 --> 1:00:44.974
Yes, I am on my way.

1:00:45.007 --> 1:00:47.143
I will be there in five
minutes, thank you.

1:00:49.844 --> 1:00:53.014
Oh, it's a photo of my dad.

1:00:53.047 --> 1:00:54.683
Where'd you get that?

1:00:54.717 --> 1:00:56.885
This is when he was head of the
CIA.

1:00:56.918 --> 1:00:58.788
- Yes.
- Almost 50 years ago.

1:00:58.820 --> 1:00:59.721
Great memories.

1:01:01.123 --> 1:01:03.458
State called, and
the embassy is furious.

1:01:03.492 --> 1:01:05.227
How could we let this happen?

1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:06.195
You know what?

1:01:06.228 --> 1:01:07.162
You're just gonna have to take
care of it.

1:01:07.195 --> 1:01:09.164
I have a meeting with
Congressional Wives.

1:01:09.197 --> 1:01:10.298
Okay, fine.

1:01:10.331 --> 1:01:12.201
Max, thank you so much for the
coffee.

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:13.168
It's a pleasure.

1:01:22.777 --> 1:01:24.179
You were in charge of that
crowd.

1:01:24.213 --> 1:01:26.282
That's what you get paid for.

1:01:26.315 --> 1:01:28.017
What happened out there,
Preston?

1:01:28.050 --> 1:01:30.052
How could you play right
into her hands like that?

1:01:30.085 --> 1:01:31.787
You can't blame me.

1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:32.955
That woman is out of control.

1:01:32.987 --> 1:01:34.256
She does what she wants.

1:01:37.226 --> 1:01:40.829
You'd think she'd almost
want Taylor to fail.

1:01:45.534 --> 1:01:50.740
Excuse me, I asked for a
latte.

1:01:51.139 --> 1:01:52.908
Does this look like a latte to
you?

1:01:54.443 --> 1:01:58.047
Yes, like I tell you every
time.

1:02:01.016 --> 1:02:02.351
You know what that is?

1:02:02.384 --> 1:02:04.820
That's a one-star review right
there.

1:02:04.853 --> 1:02:07.490
President Brooks is very good
at tennis.

1:02:07.523 --> 1:02:09.459
His serve is excellent.

1:02:15.963 --> 1:02:17.199
I can't believe this.

1:02:18.333 --> 1:02:20.336
It's that Cameron person.

1:02:20.369 --> 1:02:22.538
And she's friends with Mallory
Carrington.

1:02:22.570 --> 1:02:24.306
Was she not at dinner the
other night?

1:02:24.338 --> 1:02:25.940
I thought you were friends?

1:02:27.242 --> 1:02:28.944
Hey, Channing.

1:02:28.976 --> 1:02:30.112
I want a record of every time

1:02:30.144 --> 1:02:31.947
Cameron's been in The White
House.

1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:32.914
Okay.

1:02:32.947 --> 1:02:33.481
And do you have that
other info I needed?

1:02:33.514 --> 1:02:34.516
Mm-hmm.

1:02:34.550 --> 1:02:35.418
Yes.

1:02:38.519 --> 1:02:39.956
Not even a parking ticket.

1:02:40.789 --> 1:02:42.925
Yeah, well, there must be
something.

1:02:44.092 --> 1:02:45.394
Past boyfriends?

1:02:45.427 --> 1:02:46.562
She dated a senator.

1:02:46.594 --> 1:02:47.562
Yeah, which one?

1:02:47.596 --> 1:02:48.463
Your favorite.

1:02:49.965 --> 1:02:51.333
She dated Stone?

1:02:51.365 --> 1:02:52.867
Yeah.

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:54.770
Yeah, that means she knows
Preston.

1:02:55.704 --> 1:02:58.072
Which means I think Taylor's
being set up.

1:02:58.106 --> 1:03:00.109
Well, don't forget
the Mallory connection.

1:03:00.141 --> 1:03:03.244
Yeah, well, someone has
to connect the dots for him.

1:03:03.277 --> 1:03:05.881
She is not First Lady material.

1:03:06.681 --> 1:03:08.917
I just can't figure out her
angle.

1:03:08.951 --> 1:03:12.487
I mean, unless she and
Mallory are in it together,

1:03:12.521 --> 1:03:15.057
but what do they have to gain?

1:03:15.090 --> 1:03:17.827
Everyone knows Mallory
wants you out of the picture.

1:03:19.161 --> 1:03:22.030
Oh, all the trouble we
went to to defeat Mallory

1:03:22.063 --> 1:03:25.300
only to get a Mallory-lite
in this position?

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:27.135
And would someone please tell
those kids

1:03:27.168 --> 1:03:30.839
to either get their protest
on, or clear the sidewalks?

1:03:43.452 --> 1:03:45.054
Those poor kids.

1:03:46.288 --> 1:03:48.623
I hope she's not too tough on
them.

1:03:53.628 --> 1:03:56.397
Okay, you guys, I've
given this a lot of thought,

1:03:56.431 --> 1:03:59.201
and if you're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right, okay?

1:03:59.233 --> 1:04:02.103
So tomorrow I need you to
bring some tools with you.

1:04:02.137 --> 1:04:05.508
You need to bring pens,
papers, dictionaries...

1:04:09.344 --> 1:04:10.945
Of course.

1:04:10.978 --> 1:04:13.648
Okay, so let's get started.

1:04:13.681 --> 1:04:15.350
The first thing you need to do

1:04:15.384 --> 1:04:20.088
is to clearly articulate
what your demands are, okay?

1:04:20.121 --> 1:04:21.223
Do you have a proposal?

1:04:23.157 --> 1:04:24.326
Talking points?

1:04:26.094 --> 1:04:28.530
A list of grievances to be
addressed?

1:04:29.364 --> 1:04:33.501
Okay, so, tonight, I
want you all to go home,

1:04:33.534 --> 1:04:36.404
and each of you write down
five reasons you're protesting,

1:04:36.438 --> 1:04:37.606
and email them to me.

1:04:37.639 --> 1:04:40.309
My name at whitehouse.gov.

1:04:41.143 --> 1:04:43.945
Should we put down
that we're getting paid?

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:47.215
All right, so I'll see you
tomorrow.

1:04:47.248 --> 1:04:49.951
Oh, and no more three-hour
lunch breaks, okay?

1:04:49.985 --> 1:04:53.055
If you're gonna be serious
about this, then commit to it.

1:04:55.222 --> 1:04:56.692
Oh, here he is, here he is!

1:05:05.032 --> 1:05:05.668
Madam.

1:05:05.701 --> 1:05:06.601
Hmm.

1:05:06.635 --> 1:05:09.938
I don't mean to be forward,
but may I?

1:05:09.972 --> 1:05:10.640
Thank you.

1:05:11.639 --> 1:05:13.408
In tight quarters such as these,

1:05:13.442 --> 1:05:18.114
it's very hard to not
hear certain discussions.

1:05:19.114 --> 1:05:20.483
Yeah, well, try harder.

1:05:22.650 --> 1:05:26.221
I know that you would
like the right young woman

1:05:26.253 --> 1:05:29.357
to be the president's wife one
day,

1:05:30.324 --> 1:05:33.461
but we cannot always choose
who we fall in love with.

1:05:35.163 --> 1:05:37.532
Perhaps this young woman
that he likes is not...

1:05:39.668 --> 1:05:40.501
Is not?

1:05:40.534 --> 1:05:41.436
Well...

1:05:41.469 --> 1:05:42.303
Well?

1:05:42.336 --> 1:05:43.172
You.

1:05:43.204 --> 1:05:44.038
Me?

1:05:44.072 --> 1:05:44.974
Yes, you!

1:05:45.007 --> 1:05:46.240
Which is a good thing.

1:05:46.273 --> 1:05:48.309
Bad for her, but good for him.

1:05:48.342 --> 1:05:49.545
He can make his own decision.

1:05:49.577 --> 1:05:52.648
After all, this is not a
medieval country

1:05:52.681 --> 1:05:55.384
where wives are chosen
to keep monarchies alive.

1:05:55.416 --> 1:05:56.585
This is America.

1:05:56.617 --> 1:05:59.587
You don't have to lecture
me on what country we're in.

1:05:59.621 --> 1:06:02.157
This position is bigger than the
person.

1:06:02.190 --> 1:06:04.326
And if they don't understand
that, then I just...

1:06:04.358 --> 1:06:05.427
Oh, what am I doing?

1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:07.228
How can you possibly understand

1:06:07.262 --> 1:06:09.398
the intricacies of running a
country?

1:06:14.735 --> 1:06:18.473
Madam, he will not be
president forever.

1:06:20.208 --> 1:06:21.577
He will leave.

1:06:21.610 --> 1:06:25.481
But the position of
First Lady remains here.

1:06:27.282 --> 1:06:29.418
You do want him happy, hmm?

1:06:31.219 --> 1:06:34.023
It's not about being happy.

1:06:34.056 --> 1:06:36.391
It's about doing a job and doing
it right.

1:06:37.126 --> 1:06:41.397
And sometimes that means
you sacrifice a lot.

1:06:41.429 --> 1:06:44.165
And I will not have this
position sullied.

1:06:44.199 --> 1:06:46.235
If you continue to
interfere with his love life,

1:06:46.268 --> 1:06:48.637
it will be sullied...

1:06:48.670 --> 1:06:51.572
Whatever that is, it's a new
word.

1:06:51.606 --> 1:06:52.475
Sullied.

1:06:53.342 --> 1:06:55.644
Must look that one up, very
interesting.

1:06:55.677 --> 1:06:57.713
Ah, what have I done?

1:07:00.315 --> 1:07:01.150
Are you all right?

1:07:01.182 --> 1:07:02.550
Did you tell her?

1:07:02.583 --> 1:07:03.751
She looked angry, what did you
say?

1:07:03.784 --> 1:07:05.319
Darling, I don't know.

1:07:05.353 --> 1:07:07.456
Things, they change over time.

1:07:07.489 --> 1:07:09.057
People change.

1:07:11.159 --> 1:07:14.697
Perhaps this was just a big
mistake.

1:07:15.630 --> 1:07:17.199
You can't give up.

1:07:18.365 --> 1:07:20.201
You haven't even told her!

1:07:21.769 --> 1:07:23.505
Mr. President,

1:07:23.538 --> 1:07:25.740
here's the seating chart
for Friday's dinner.

1:07:27.742 --> 1:07:31.280
And she's waiting outside,
should I send her in?

1:07:33.849 --> 1:07:35.785
I invited Mallory, can you add
her?

1:07:36.552 --> 1:07:39.421
You do know she works for the
media now?

1:07:39.454 --> 1:07:41.257
Oh, and she hates you.

1:07:42.724 --> 1:07:44.426
And that's even after...

1:07:44.458 --> 1:07:45.326
After what?

1:07:46.327 --> 1:07:48.797
After she's on the
tennis court with Cameron.

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:53.501
Can you really trust someone
who has a friend like Mallory?

1:07:53.534 --> 1:07:55.436
I didn't know that they were
friends.

1:07:55.469 --> 1:07:58.506
It just means that Cameron
has eclectic taste.

1:07:58.539 --> 1:08:00.409
It means she has no taste.

1:08:00.442 --> 1:08:02.545
And then to date a man like
Stone?

1:08:03.677 --> 1:08:06.114
I think you're playing with
fire.

1:08:06.148 --> 1:08:09.652
Well, I'd like to invite that
fire to the dinner as well.

1:08:10.784 --> 1:08:11.585
And I know about Stone.

1:08:11.619 --> 1:08:14.090
She was his escort, nothing
more.

1:08:15.422 --> 1:08:17.458
That's a polite name
for an old profession.

1:08:17.492 --> 1:08:20.662
She and I have discussed all
of this.

1:08:20.694 --> 1:08:21.796
Why the third degree?

1:08:22.497 --> 1:08:25.300
Logistically, it's just not
possible.

1:08:25.332 --> 1:08:26.801
The room's totally full as it
is.

1:08:26.835 --> 1:08:29.337
I can't possibly find
space for two more people.

1:08:29.371 --> 1:08:31.206
I'm sure you can find space.

1:08:31.238 --> 1:08:32.807
Bring in a card table or
something.

1:08:32.841 --> 1:08:33.709
Taylor.

1:08:35.377 --> 1:08:39.181
It's not that easy to rearrange
a table.

1:08:39.213 --> 1:08:42.216
There are complexities
that I can't explain.

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:44.853
Kate, if that room was large
enough

1:08:44.886 --> 1:08:47.322
for Alice Roosevelt to
rollerskate in,

1:08:47.354 --> 1:08:51.759
then I'm sure you can find room
for two more dinner guests.

1:08:53.595 --> 1:08:56.198
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a brief to prepare.

1:08:58.233 --> 1:09:03.204
Oh, and if, just in case,
Mallory does intend me harm,

1:09:04.038 --> 1:09:06.407
then put her on the
opposite end of the table,

1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:07.576
and Cameron to my left.

1:09:09.778 --> 1:09:10.779
I'll take that call.

1:09:13.648 --> 1:09:15.284
How'd it go?

1:09:15.317 --> 1:09:16.150
Uh-oh.

1:09:16.185 --> 1:09:18.520
Why is he belaboring a seating
chart?

1:09:18.552 --> 1:09:21.823
Unless it's a signal he doesn't
trust me, or need my help?

1:09:21.855 --> 1:09:24.893
He knows there are reasons
to seat people together.

1:09:24.926 --> 1:09:26.795
He has to consider the history
books.

1:09:26.828 --> 1:09:29.264
You think this dinner is
gonna be in the history books?

1:09:29.296 --> 1:09:31.365
Everything that happens
in The White House

1:09:31.399 --> 1:09:32.467
is in the history books.

1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:36.505
Historians pour over tapes,
letters, memos, emails,

1:09:36.537 --> 1:09:38.806
even seating charts for state
dinners.

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:40.543
But this isn't a state dinner.

1:09:41.243 --> 1:09:43.378
I don't wanna one day
read in a history book

1:09:43.411 --> 1:09:47.248
that I lost control over
the standards of protocol,

1:09:47.282 --> 1:09:48.350
that I somehow encouraged

1:09:48.382 --> 1:09:51.220
the president's prepubescent
dalliance with a woman

1:09:51.252 --> 1:09:52.688
who very well could be plotting

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:54.722
to undermine him politically.

1:09:54.756 --> 1:09:57.826
That would actually be much
more interesting to read.

1:09:59.261 --> 1:10:01.597
You will record that I did
what was best

1:10:01.630 --> 1:10:04.733
for the nation and for President
Brooks.

1:10:04.765 --> 1:10:06.568
Well, they will record
something.

1:10:11.905 --> 1:10:12.774
Oh.

1:10:14.042 --> 1:10:15.611
Oh, Kate, I'm so sorry.

1:10:15.644 --> 1:10:17.546
I didn't see you wandering the
halls.

1:10:17.578 --> 1:10:19.380
If anyone's wandering
the halls, it's you.

1:10:19.413 --> 1:10:21.483
What are you doing in The
White House without an escort?

1:10:21.515 --> 1:10:22.717
Where's your visitor's badge?

1:10:22.751 --> 1:10:23.918
And it's Kathryn.

1:10:24.886 --> 1:10:26.355
Ha!

1:10:26.387 --> 1:10:27.622
You are not.

1:10:27.655 --> 1:10:29.024
Where'd you get that?

1:10:29.056 --> 1:10:30.891
A little office in the EEOB

1:10:30.925 --> 1:10:33.494
that issues official
White House staff IDs.

1:10:33.528 --> 1:10:37.632
But this one I got directly
from President Brooks.

1:10:38.899 --> 1:10:39.768
Total access.

1:10:54.682 --> 1:10:56.252
Grandfather, what are you
doing?

1:11:02.090 --> 1:11:04.760
No, I won't let you throw your
dream away.

1:11:06.328 --> 1:11:08.597
We leave only after
you've told her the truth.

1:11:13.935 --> 1:11:17.306
Madam, are you all right?

1:11:17.338 --> 1:11:18.006
Yes.

1:11:20.742 --> 1:11:21.610
No.

1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:26.047
I'll be fine.

1:11:27.381 --> 1:11:29.652
I help the princess when she
is sad.

1:11:30.819 --> 1:11:34.523
She says I have a good shoulder
to cry on.

1:11:37.524 --> 1:11:39.627
And I'm sure she wouldn't mind
sharing it.

1:11:55.944 --> 1:11:56.945
Crying is good.

1:11:57.845 --> 1:12:01.449
It's a valve that releases
all the built up pressure.

1:12:07.721 --> 1:12:08.856
I'm a failure.

1:12:08.890 --> 1:12:09.758
No.

1:12:10.958 --> 1:12:13.095
I thought I could make a
difference.

1:12:13.127 --> 1:12:15.663
And now I've let down two
presidents.

1:12:16.831 --> 1:12:19.101
I've truly sullied this
position.

1:12:19.134 --> 1:12:20.969
Madam, I now know what sully
means,

1:12:21.002 --> 1:12:24.506
and you are not capable
of sullying anything.

1:12:24.538 --> 1:12:27.641
But Taylor thinks I'm trying
to run his personal life.

1:12:27.675 --> 1:12:28.810
But you are, aren't you?

1:12:28.842 --> 1:12:30.645
Well, that's beside the point.

1:12:32.447 --> 1:12:33.681
It's for his own good.

1:12:35.082 --> 1:12:38.386
And he doesn't see I'm
just trying to help.

1:12:43.425 --> 1:12:47.529
This is very good to help
the tears flow more freely.

1:12:48.529 --> 1:12:52.667
The best brandy in the
world, it's from my king.

1:13:13.488 --> 1:13:16.925
Preston, this is the guest
list for the state dinner.

1:13:16.957 --> 1:13:18.726
I want it exactly like this.

1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:21.695
She makes any changes, I
wanna know immediately.

1:13:21.729 --> 1:13:22.597
I'm on it.

1:13:27.001 --> 1:13:29.738
Would you like me to monitor
all her correspondence

1:13:29.770 --> 1:13:31.472
and communications with State?

1:13:31.506 --> 1:13:32.740
Just to be sure, you know?

1:13:33.875 --> 1:13:37.546
Good idea, I don't wanna be
blindsided again on any issue.

1:13:44.485 --> 1:13:46.488
Yes. Mm-hmm.

1:13:48.622 --> 1:13:50.991
Your king has very good taste.

1:13:51.024 --> 1:13:51.893
Indeed.

1:13:54.729 --> 1:13:55.864
This is wonderful.

1:13:55.896 --> 1:13:56.965
Yes, it is.

1:13:57.931 --> 1:13:59.134
It really is.

1:14:01.502 --> 1:14:02.737
Now, better?

1:14:02.770 --> 1:14:03.638
Mm-hmm.

1:14:03.671 --> 1:14:04.640
Come now.

1:14:06.707 --> 1:14:10.645
I promised Alex that
I would help Taylor.

1:14:13.081 --> 1:14:16.918
Now the history books are
gonna say that I'm a failure.

1:14:16.951 --> 1:14:17.786
No.

1:14:17.819 --> 1:14:19.554
Or worse, a phony.

1:14:19.587 --> 1:14:20.456
Ssh.

1:14:30.899 --> 1:14:32.668
Oh, I love that song.

1:14:35.904 --> 1:14:40.642
♪ Ah, something, something about
Heaven ♪

1:14:41.509 --> 1:14:44.813
It was popular when I was in my
teens.

1:14:44.845 --> 1:14:47.882
♪ La, da, da, da, da ♪

1:14:49.751 --> 1:14:51.220
Here you go, yes.

1:14:56.990 --> 1:14:58.993
Did your king give you this,
too?

1:14:59.027 --> 1:15:02.497
Mm-hmm.

1:15:04.164 --> 1:15:07.269
He seems like a really nice
man.

1:15:07.301 --> 1:15:08.769
I must meet him.

1:15:11.738 --> 1:15:12.740
A nice man.

1:15:14.175 --> 1:15:14.976
Madam.

1:15:15.009 --> 1:15:15.877
Hmm?

1:15:15.909 --> 1:15:18.180
I do believe you're drunk.

1:15:21.582 --> 1:15:25.119
That is what Lady Astor
said to Winston Churchill.

1:15:25.153 --> 1:15:26.121
Mm-hmm.

1:15:26.154 --> 1:15:30.759
And he said, "Yes. And, Madam?

1:15:30.792 --> 1:15:31.927
"You are ugly.

1:15:33.728 --> 1:15:37.666
"But in the morning, I will be
sober

1:15:37.698 --> 1:15:40.536
"and you will still be ugly."

1:15:43.837 --> 1:15:45.806
Oh, but, no.

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:47.609
You are not ugly.

1:15:49.810 --> 1:15:52.112
But you do look familiar.

1:15:52.145 --> 1:15:52.980
Yes.

1:15:53.014 --> 1:15:54.082
Do I know you?

1:15:55.015 --> 1:15:57.851
Yes, for some time now,

1:15:57.885 --> 1:16:01.088
I have been meaning to show you
this.

1:16:01.122 --> 1:16:03.959
Perhaps you'll recall...

1:16:08.128 --> 1:16:10.064
Madam?

1:16:10.097 --> 1:16:10.966
Madam?

1:16:21.309 --> 1:16:22.644
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:16:26.413 --> 1:16:27.282
And yes.

1:16:34.855 --> 1:16:36.090
Thanks, Max.

1:16:49.170 --> 1:16:50.739
Who is it?

1:16:50.771 --> 1:16:52.707
A very special coffee
delivery.

1:16:54.975 --> 1:16:56.243
Just a minute.

1:17:01.381 --> 1:17:02.984
Oh, just come in.

1:17:08.689 --> 1:17:09.857
Good morning.

1:17:13.427 --> 1:17:14.997
What are you smiling about?

1:17:15.962 --> 1:17:17.398
I find it quite humorous

1:17:17.431 --> 1:17:20.100
that you have all these cameras

1:17:20.134 --> 1:17:21.235
around The White House

1:17:21.269 --> 1:17:23.805
and everything will be a part of
history.

1:17:24.538 --> 1:17:27.274
How are you going to explain
this?

1:17:28.408 --> 1:17:30.244
I won't even be a footnote.

1:17:42.289 --> 1:17:43.225
Farewell.

1:17:45.126 --> 1:17:46.228
Thank you, Max.

1:17:55.502 --> 1:17:56.371
Madam.

1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:01.141
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1:18:01.175 --> 1:18:02.076
- Okay.
- Let's just share that.

1:18:02.109 --> 1:18:02.943
Does that give her
enough time?

1:18:02.976 --> 1:18:04.479
Okay, great, it will, she's
fine-

1:18:04.511 --> 1:18:05.479
- She gets about an hour

1:18:05.512 --> 1:18:08.349
and they're very delicate
with what they do.

1:18:08.381 --> 1:18:09.183
So wait do you wanna-

1:18:09.216 --> 1:18:10.384
- Shh, wait a second.

1:18:13.087 --> 1:18:14.756
May I speak to all of you
please?

1:18:14.788 --> 1:18:15.456
Sure.

1:18:19.793 --> 1:18:21.930
When I agreed to come
back as First Lady,

1:18:22.896 --> 1:18:25.100
I really thought I could
make a difference here

1:18:25.132 --> 1:18:26.333
in The White House.

1:18:26.368 --> 1:18:29.871
But the truth is, I've just
been playing a role this time.

1:18:31.238 --> 1:18:34.375
Just pretending to be
something I'm not anymore.

1:18:34.408 --> 1:18:37.779
And after reading all the
emails from our protest friends

1:18:37.811 --> 1:18:39.814
and seeing such a lack
of historical knowledge,

1:18:39.846 --> 1:18:43.018
I realized that I could do more
out there

1:18:44.118 --> 1:18:45.787
to impact what happens in here.

1:18:46.621 --> 1:18:48.389
I mean, what's the point
of preserving history,

1:18:48.421 --> 1:18:51.158
if no one even knows what it is?

1:18:54.228 --> 1:18:57.498
So I've decided to turn in
my resignation to Taylor.

1:18:57.532 --> 1:18:58.766
No, you can't do that.

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:00.268
Kate, we need you here.

1:19:00.301 --> 1:19:01.936
The country needs you here.

1:19:01.969 --> 1:19:05.172
No, the country has far
greater needs than a First Lady

1:19:05.206 --> 1:19:06.807
who's stuck in the past.

1:19:07.809 --> 1:19:09.311
I just never saw it before now.

1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:17.886
I guess everything and
everyone needs a do over.

1:19:21.588 --> 1:19:23.925
A chance to just be themselves.

1:19:50.851 --> 1:19:53.354
Perfect, thank you, Max.

1:19:53.386 --> 1:19:56.990
Okay, let's do this.

1:19:57.024 --> 1:19:57.992
Since yesterday we've been
coming up

1:19:58.024 --> 1:20:00.060
with some pretty cool chants.

1:20:00.094 --> 1:20:01.061
Oh, that's great, Hank.

1:20:01.095 --> 1:20:04.365
Okay, but first, I read
through all your emails.

1:20:04.398 --> 1:20:06.467
I was so encouraged to receive
so many,

1:20:06.500 --> 1:20:10.404
but disappointed more of
you didn't participate.

1:20:10.438 --> 1:20:12.373
The first thing I want you to
learn

1:20:12.405 --> 1:20:15.275
is to think and speak for
yourselves.

1:20:15.309 --> 1:20:18.279
Every single one of you has a
voice.

1:20:18.311 --> 1:20:19.881
Could you tell what
we were trying to say

1:20:19.913 --> 1:20:20.881
by what we wrote?

1:20:22.449 --> 1:20:23.918
Let's hear those chants.

1:20:44.471 --> 1:20:46.006
Just keep it up until I tell
you to stop

1:20:46.039 --> 1:20:47.274
or you won't get paid.

1:20:47.307 --> 1:20:50.078
And I don't wanna see anybody
talking to Kate or you're out.

1:20:50.110 --> 1:20:53.046
But she's just trying to help.

1:20:53.079 --> 1:20:54.282
We think if we-

1:20:54.314 --> 1:20:55.949
- We're not paying you to think.

1:20:55.983 --> 1:20:58.353
We're paying you to do
what we tell you to do.

1:20:58.386 --> 1:21:00.154
She's the enemy.

1:21:00.186 --> 1:21:01.622
How dumb can you people be?

1:21:01.655 --> 1:21:03.524
Then why is she helping over
there?

1:21:08.029 --> 1:21:08.663
Just do what we're paying you
to do

1:21:08.695 --> 1:21:10.164
and keep your mouth shut.

1:21:13.501 --> 1:21:14.502
What's she doing?

1:21:15.235 --> 1:21:17.538
Is she holding some kind of
class?

1:21:19.039 --> 1:21:19.908
Wait.

1:21:21.542 --> 1:21:23.544
Pause and pull up on that.

1:21:23.577 --> 1:21:25.480
Is that Preston?

1:21:25.512 --> 1:21:27.649
We are getting a live
feed from The White House

1:21:27.681 --> 1:21:29.684
where it seems as though Kate
Morales

1:21:29.716 --> 1:21:32.920
is enticing the kids to
revolution.

1:21:32.953 --> 1:21:36.323
Now, is she putting the
president's life at danger

1:21:36.356 --> 1:21:39.694
by even associating with those
protesters?

1:21:39.726 --> 1:21:44.698
Well, anytime there's a potential
threat to the president,

1:21:44.731 --> 1:21:47.467
the Secret Service has
to look at, overall,

1:21:47.501 --> 1:21:51.338
the circumstances and, you
know, judge appropriately

1:21:51.372 --> 1:21:52.440
what action to take.

1:21:52.472 --> 1:21:55.243
Uh-huh, yeah, well,
clearly she's enticing them.

1:21:56.344 --> 1:21:57.011
Enticing?

1:21:57.045 --> 1:21:57.712
It's supposed to be inciting.

1:21:57.746 --> 1:21:59.113
Why can't she she say inciting?

1:21:59.145 --> 1:22:00.916
It's a simple word.

1:22:02.182 --> 1:22:04.018
Okay, okay.

1:22:04.051 --> 1:22:07.155
Not bad, but let's try it again.

1:22:07.188 --> 1:22:09.489
And this time in one cadence.

1:22:09.523 --> 1:22:10.625
Okay, everybody all together.

1:22:10.658 --> 1:22:12.093
Let's try this phrase.

1:22:12.126 --> 1:22:14.561
Learning leads to Liberty.

1:22:14.595 --> 1:22:17.097
Tada, tada, tada, come on!

1:22:17.131 --> 1:22:17.765
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:22:17.798 --> 1:22:19.734
Learning leads to Liberty.

1:22:19.766 --> 1:22:22.603
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:22:22.636 --> 1:22:23.470
More passion, learn!

1:22:23.503 --> 1:22:25.974
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:22:26.006 --> 1:22:28.375
Pull up camera three.

1:22:28.408 --> 1:22:30.411
All right, now push in.

1:22:30.444 --> 1:22:31.379
Rewind that part.

1:22:33.180 --> 1:22:34.316
That is Preston.

1:22:36.751 --> 1:22:37.685
I thought he hated her.

1:22:37.717 --> 1:22:39.619
Why are they both out there?

1:22:39.653 --> 1:22:40.755
Wasn't the chocolate milk summit

1:22:40.787 --> 1:22:42.656
a big enough disaster for
Taylor?

1:22:42.689 --> 1:22:45.158
Kathryn Morales is clearly
enticing

1:22:45.192 --> 1:22:47.328
that boisterous crowd by
chanting

1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:49.529
"Learning leads to Liberty."

1:22:51.465 --> 1:22:55.369
What should the Secret Service
do in a situation like this?

1:22:55.403 --> 1:22:57.438
Well, in this case,

1:22:57.470 --> 1:22:59.673
it is unprecedented that a First
Lady

1:22:59.707 --> 1:23:03.578
would engage a crowd
that could potentially

1:23:03.610 --> 1:23:05.345
pose a threat to the president.

1:23:05.378 --> 1:23:06.314
Uh-huh.

1:23:06.346 --> 1:23:08.782
Well, does the fact
that they're not married

1:23:08.815 --> 1:23:11.485
and she really isn't a First
Lady

1:23:11.519 --> 1:23:14.188
put the president in
more danger than usual?

1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:15.589
I knew she'd be trouble.

1:23:15.622 --> 1:23:18.125
Just keep an eye on this
before it gets out of control.

1:23:21.796 --> 1:23:23.597
Silence says so much, doesn't
it?

1:23:28.269 --> 1:23:29.369
Preston, what are you doing
out there

1:23:29.403 --> 1:23:31.105
with those protesters?

1:23:31.137 --> 1:23:33.774
It's bad enough Kate's out
there encouraging them.

1:23:33.807 --> 1:23:34.676
What's the deal?

1:23:36.510 --> 1:23:39.579
When Kate went out, I was
concerned for her safety,

1:23:39.613 --> 1:23:42.517
so I was making sure she was
okay.

1:23:42.550 --> 1:23:44.351
But you were outside the
gate talking with them.

1:23:44.385 --> 1:23:45.353
She was inside.

1:23:45.386 --> 1:23:47.155
How does that help her?

1:23:47.188 --> 1:23:49.157
I was warning them to be
polite.

1:23:50.291 --> 1:23:52.827
Oh, like you?

1:23:52.859 --> 1:23:53.527
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:54.394
I can't hear you on this side.

1:23:54.427 --> 1:23:56.631
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:23:56.663 --> 1:23:57.497
You got it!

1:23:57.530 --> 1:23:59.634
Hey, the gate's open.

1:23:59.667 --> 1:24:01.536
Learning leads to
Liberty.

1:24:01.569 --> 1:24:03.171
Nope, nope.

1:24:07.740 --> 1:24:08.609
Max!

1:24:09.844 --> 1:24:11.179
Kate, madam!

1:24:11.878 --> 1:24:12.747
Let me go!

1:24:18.618 --> 1:24:20.287
Oh, Max, I am so
sorry, are you all right?

1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:22.323
I will be fine, madam, I'm
very sorry.

1:24:24.725 --> 1:24:25.593
Max, where is-

1:24:25.626 --> 1:24:27.362
- Gieselle, it's okay, it's
Gieselle.

1:24:28.029 --> 1:24:30.465
Please, he's her bodyguard, it's
Max.

1:24:30.497 --> 1:24:31.631
He's just trying to protect me.

1:24:31.664 --> 1:24:32.699
Please, may we see him?

1:24:32.733 --> 1:24:34.402
I'll let you know in a little
bit.

1:24:38.905 --> 1:24:40.373
Okay, you say he's only a
bodyguard,

1:24:40.407 --> 1:24:41.775
then why is the State Department
here?

1:24:41.809 --> 1:24:43.244
I don't know.

1:24:43.277 --> 1:24:44.311
Maybe they're just trying

1:24:44.345 --> 1:24:46.481
to avoid an international
incident, I don't know.

1:24:52.286 --> 1:24:54.454
It seems as though Kathryn
Morales

1:24:54.488 --> 1:24:57.525
has caused an international
incident.

1:24:57.557 --> 1:24:59.760
The bodyguard of one
of the foreign interns

1:24:59.792 --> 1:25:01.761
has been taken into custody
today

1:25:01.795 --> 1:25:05.899
for striking a Secret Service
agent.

1:25:05.932 --> 1:25:09.804
This is a disaster for President
Brooks.

1:25:11.572 --> 1:25:14.442
What in the world is
going on around here?

1:25:14.475 --> 1:25:17.178
Did I just hear that there
was a security breach

1:25:17.211 --> 1:25:20.481
at The White House gate
and a guard was attacked?

1:25:20.514 --> 1:25:22.182
Oh, that's all you heard?

1:25:22.216 --> 1:25:24.318
Did you hear that Kate
possibly incited the riot?

1:25:24.350 --> 1:25:26.453
It wasn't exactly a riot.

1:25:26.487 --> 1:25:28.222
What exactly was it then?

1:25:29.489 --> 1:25:31.692
I got to find out what's going
on.

1:25:31.725 --> 1:25:34.896
Gentlemen, I would ask
that you not share anything

1:25:34.929 --> 1:25:36.596
that we've discussed with
Kathryn.

1:25:36.630 --> 1:25:39.333
I've been trying to find a way
to tell her

1:25:39.365 --> 1:25:42.737
but I have not been able to.

1:25:42.770 --> 1:25:46.740
But I suppose now is the
time for truth and not here.

1:25:46.774 --> 1:25:47.875
Yes, sir.

1:25:47.908 --> 1:25:48.809
Yeah.

1:25:48.842 --> 1:25:50.778
Well of course, sir, whatever
you wish.

1:25:50.810 --> 1:25:51.679
Yes.

1:25:53.213 --> 1:25:56.184
Kate, what is going on?

1:25:56.216 --> 1:25:59.252
Hey Max, sorry about them
roughing you up like that.

1:25:59.286 --> 1:26:00.221
We all have a job to do,

1:26:00.253 --> 1:26:02.289
and besides we know
you wouldn't hurt Kate.

1:26:02.323 --> 1:26:04.893
After all, we have access
to all the security cameras.

1:26:10.730 --> 1:26:14.534
Even in that little sitting
room outside the oval office?

1:26:14.568 --> 1:26:15.536
Yeah.

1:26:15.569 --> 1:26:16.437
Oh.

1:26:18.305 --> 1:26:20.441
How do you say busted?

1:26:21.375 --> 1:26:25.313
Mallory is on TV saying
that you're inciting riots

1:26:26.579 --> 1:26:27.948
and what is Max doing in
custody?

1:26:27.981 --> 1:26:31.418
Look, Taylor, I'm so
sorry, this is all my fault.

1:26:31.452 --> 1:26:33.688
I just thought I could help the
kids.

1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:36.590
They just seemed so
lost when they came here

1:26:36.623 --> 1:26:40.260
and I just was trying to give
them purpose and direction.

1:26:40.293 --> 1:26:42.662
Kate, that's not your job.

1:26:42.695 --> 1:26:44.298
What is my job?

1:26:45.565 --> 1:26:48.001
You know, my job died with Alex

1:26:48.034 --> 1:26:51.005
and all I really wanna
do is go back to teaching

1:26:51.037 --> 1:26:53.873
and these kids finally
reminded me of that.

1:26:53.907 --> 1:26:57.411
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to sound like that.

1:26:57.444 --> 1:26:58.613
Oh, Max, are you all right?

1:26:58.645 --> 1:26:59.479
Did they arrest you?

1:26:59.512 --> 1:27:00.347
I'm fine.

1:27:00.381 --> 1:27:02.250
Sorry again, Max.

1:27:03.516 --> 1:27:04.885
Yes, yes, I'm fine, madam.

1:27:05.752 --> 1:27:07.721
As you once told me, the Secret
Service,

1:27:07.755 --> 1:27:10.891
they do a very good job around
here.

1:27:10.923 --> 1:27:13.894
We see that Kathryn
Morales has been taken

1:27:13.926 --> 1:27:17.931
into custody today for enticing
a riot.

1:27:17.965 --> 1:27:20.768
It will now be up to
President Brooks to decide

1:27:20.801 --> 1:27:25.405
if he wants to keep her on
as First Lady or fire her.

1:27:25.439 --> 1:27:28.009
She wasn't taken into
custody, you idiot.

1:27:28.042 --> 1:27:30.311
And if anyone's inciting a riot,
it's you.

1:27:31.311 --> 1:27:32.579
Pete, she can't hear you.

1:27:33.479 --> 1:27:36.317
Hey, look, they're letting
protesters in the gates.

1:27:38.918 --> 1:27:41.555
That is not a good idea.

1:27:41.587 --> 1:27:43.957
They're clearly crazed and
dangerous.

1:27:43.990 --> 1:27:45.693
And didn't Taylor go down there?

1:27:46.859 --> 1:27:48.395
I better make sure he's okay.

1:27:50.898 --> 1:27:54.502
Again, with him thinking he's
Secret Service or something.

1:27:54.534 --> 1:27:57.639
I'm telling you, Kate had
nothing to do with our cause.

1:27:58.405 --> 1:28:00.975
She wasn't really sure what it
was anyway.

1:28:02.342 --> 1:28:04.778
I mean, to be honest, neither
did we.

1:28:04.811 --> 1:28:08.615
We were paid to protest to
make the president look weak.

1:28:08.649 --> 1:28:09.717
Who paid you?

1:28:09.750 --> 1:28:11.886
Some guy in a ball cap would
come out

1:28:11.918 --> 1:28:14.521
and give us debit cards.

1:28:17.524 --> 1:28:20.961
He looks a lot like that
dude over there by the door.

1:28:20.993 --> 1:28:21.828
That guy?

1:28:21.862 --> 1:28:22.697
Yeah.

1:28:22.729 --> 1:28:23.597
Come here.

1:28:24.797 --> 1:28:25.632
This is the guy you're talking
about?

1:28:25.666 --> 1:28:26.333
Yeah.

1:28:26.367 --> 1:28:27.768
He works for President Brooks.

1:28:27.801 --> 1:28:28.669
Are you sure?

1:28:28.702 --> 1:28:29.737
You wanna try again?

1:28:29.770 --> 1:28:34.542
No, that's him except
he always had that cap on.

1:28:38.811 --> 1:28:39.680
You mean this?

1:28:39.712 --> 1:28:41.349
Yeah, that's the one.

1:28:41.381 --> 1:28:43.116
And that's the dude.

1:28:43.149 --> 1:28:45.420
See if he has the debit cards on
him.

1:28:54.127 --> 1:28:58.098
Preston, you're fired.

1:29:00.900 --> 1:29:01.769
Take him away.

1:29:04.137 --> 1:29:06.439
Thank you so much for having the
courage

1:29:06.472 --> 1:29:08.975
to tell us what really happened.

1:29:09.009 --> 1:29:10.511
If you'd like to discuss your
issue,

1:29:10.543 --> 1:29:14.414
I want you to know my office is
open.

1:29:14.448 --> 1:29:15.449
You got it, Mr. President.

1:29:15.481 --> 1:29:17.385
But before you do, okay,

1:29:17.417 --> 1:29:18.885
I want you to have your thoughts
in order,

1:29:18.918 --> 1:29:22.155
prioritize your agenda and work
on that verbal articulation,

1:29:22.189 --> 1:29:23.524
Hank, so there's no ambiguity
about what you want-

1:29:23.556 --> 1:29:25.658
- Madam, he understands.

1:29:25.692 --> 1:29:26.560
Okay.

1:29:30.730 --> 1:29:33.400
Madam, for some time now

1:29:35.569 --> 1:29:39.740
I've been trying to
share something with you.

1:29:43.042 --> 1:29:44.144
Your Majesty.

1:29:44.177 --> 1:29:47.782
Welcome to our country and our
palace.

1:29:47.814 --> 1:29:49.884
And this must be Kathryn.

1:29:49.917 --> 1:29:51.052
Your Majesty.

1:29:51.085 --> 1:29:56.157
My son sends his regrets,
but his valet, Tom Edwards

1:29:57.824 --> 1:30:00.094
is delighted to be your escort
today.

1:30:02.496 --> 1:30:05.666
You will be in very good hands.

1:30:06.966 --> 1:30:08.536
Thank you.

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:10.471
Your majesty, the royal
photographer

1:30:10.503 --> 1:30:11.771
would like to get a photograph.

1:30:11.805 --> 1:30:13.474
But of course, please.

1:30:28.721 --> 1:30:29.890
Oh my gosh, Tom?

1:30:31.024 --> 1:30:31.859
Yes.

1:30:31.891 --> 1:30:33.193
Oh my God, it's you.

1:30:33.226 --> 1:30:34.127
Yes.

1:30:34.161 --> 1:30:35.596
Oh, it's really you.

1:30:35.628 --> 1:30:37.564
It is, indeed.

1:30:37.597 --> 1:30:40.100
But, why Max, who's Max?

1:30:41.702 --> 1:30:43.137
Tom, Max, Max, Tom.

1:30:43.170 --> 1:30:44.238
They're one and the same,

1:30:44.270 --> 1:30:48.741
a young teenage boy now
trapped in an old man's body

1:30:48.774 --> 1:30:49.809
who fell in love with you

1:30:49.842 --> 1:30:53.547
when you visited my country
almost 50 years ago.

1:30:57.184 --> 1:30:58.786
Tom, this is wonderful.

1:31:01.555 --> 1:31:03.990
I have thought about you
so often through the years.

1:31:04.024 --> 1:31:04.892
Yes?

1:31:04.925 --> 1:31:06.560
- Yes.
- Ah.

1:31:06.592 --> 1:31:09.497
But why go to all this trouble
now?

1:31:09.529 --> 1:31:12.065
Why didn't you just come as
yourself?

1:31:12.099 --> 1:31:14.601
I didn't know if you had
changed,

1:31:14.635 --> 1:31:17.171
if that spark was still there.

1:31:23.644 --> 1:31:25.980
I didn't wanna build up hope.

1:31:26.012 --> 1:31:29.182
Then I saw that you had
come back to The White House

1:31:29.216 --> 1:31:34.188
and I, well, I got ahold of my
friends

1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:36.823
at the State Department.

1:31:36.856 --> 1:31:37.725
Oh.

1:31:39.926 --> 1:31:42.829
The food, of course, is
way better in your mind.

1:31:42.863 --> 1:31:44.798
Food, do you know how long
it's been

1:31:44.831 --> 1:31:46.867
since I've had a dinner for my
friends,

1:31:46.899 --> 1:31:48.568
for people I actually like?

1:31:49.336 --> 1:31:50.838
I'm cooking dinner tonight.

1:31:52.238 --> 1:31:53.673
What?

1:31:53.707 --> 1:31:54.575
I can cook.

1:31:55.809 --> 1:31:56.677
Well, sort of.

1:31:58.779 --> 1:31:59.813
Are we invited?

1:31:59.845 --> 1:32:02.315
Well, of course you're
invited.

1:32:02.349 --> 1:32:04.885
We're gonna use paper
plates, no fancy stuff.

1:32:04.917 --> 1:32:07.320
Paper plates, I just wanna
have fun at a dinner.

1:32:07.354 --> 1:32:10.057
Hey, why don't you call Madison
and the others to join us?

1:32:12.626 --> 1:32:13.827
When are you going to tell her
the rest?

1:32:13.859 --> 1:32:15.261
She deserves to know.

1:32:15.295 --> 1:32:17.965
How do I confess my deception?

1:32:17.997 --> 1:32:20.567
She's going to hate me when I
tell her.

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.336
You had a good reason,
she'll understand.

1:32:23.369 --> 1:32:28.576
Besides, that is not
hate I see in her face.

1:32:32.378 --> 1:32:34.081
Mrs. Morales, do you
know "Morning Has Broken?"

1:32:34.113 --> 1:32:35.148
We can't remember the words to
it

1:32:35.181 --> 1:32:37.952
and we think it was popular
when you were young.

1:32:37.984 --> 1:32:42.556
Yes, it was actually my
favorite song as a teenager.

1:32:44.190 --> 1:32:46.760
You remember that song
too, don't you, Max?

1:32:46.792 --> 1:32:48.094
Oh, wow, I know that tune.

1:32:48.127 --> 1:32:49.829
You have a piano, right?

1:32:49.863 --> 1:32:50.965
- Do you mind?
- Yes, living room.

1:32:50.997 --> 1:32:52.966
- All right, perfect.
- Let's go play.

1:33:07.014 --> 1:33:11.085
Ah, a handwritten notes
on her wedding invitation.

1:33:11.118 --> 1:33:13.253
How adorably retro.

1:33:13.286 --> 1:33:14.922
How very First Lady.

1:33:15.988 --> 1:33:19.058
"Dear Kathryn, it would
mean so much to Taylor and me

1:33:19.091 --> 1:33:21.161
"if you would attend our
wedding,

1:33:21.194 --> 1:33:23.163
"it would be our great honor

1:33:23.195 --> 1:33:24.998
"if you would join us, Cameron."

1:33:26.265 --> 1:33:27.134
Yeah.

1:33:29.002 --> 1:33:32.073
Yep, she's perfect.

1:33:36.810 --> 1:33:38.946
Oh, I left my rock necklace on
the mantle.

1:33:38.979 --> 1:33:41.914
Max, dear, would you
mind getting it for me?

1:33:41.948 --> 1:33:42.817
Of course.

1:33:57.797 --> 1:33:59.166
You look stunning.

1:33:59.198 --> 1:34:00.900
Why, thank you, Mr. President.

1:34:06.372 --> 1:34:07.240
Kate.

1:34:14.881 --> 1:34:16.350
Excuse me, Mrs. Morales.

1:34:17.384 --> 1:34:18.786
Our buddy, buddy, right?

1:34:18.819 --> 1:34:19.620
Yes.

1:34:19.653 --> 1:34:21.155
Our buddy, Hank, wanted to say
hi.

1:34:21.188 --> 1:34:22.088
He knew you'd be here today.

1:34:22.122 --> 1:34:22.956
Hi, Hank.

1:34:22.988 --> 1:34:23.956
Hi, Kate.

1:34:23.989 --> 1:34:26.394
I just wanted to let you
know that I got a job,

1:34:27.228 --> 1:34:30.864
and if it wasn't for you, I'd
still be on that sidewalk.

1:34:30.896 --> 1:34:32.800
That is wonderful, what's your
job?

1:34:32.832 --> 1:34:34.300
Community organizer.

1:34:34.333 --> 1:34:37.738
Perfect, I'm very proud of
you.

1:34:37.770 --> 1:34:39.405
Thank you, Kate.

1:34:39.439 --> 1:34:40.341
Good job, buddy.

1:34:44.110 --> 1:34:46.313
I am truly happy for you both.

1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:48.815
Love is hard to find

1:34:49.582 --> 1:34:51.050
and to think I tried to break
you up.

1:34:51.083 --> 1:34:53.688
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

1:34:54.454 --> 1:34:58.057
Kate, I know you just
wanted the best for me

1:34:58.091 --> 1:35:01.028
and The White House and the
country.

1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:03.296
And the position of First
Lady,

1:35:03.329 --> 1:35:07.201
which is why we wanted to ask
you back.

1:35:07.234 --> 1:35:08.402
Yes.

1:35:08.435 --> 1:35:11.305
I have a much better offer
that I hope you will accept.

1:35:13.172 --> 1:35:16.210
But first, I must tell you
the whole truth before I do.

1:35:16.243 --> 1:35:20.481
You see, I've only told
you part of the story

1:35:20.514 --> 1:35:22.216
of how we first met.

1:35:22.248 --> 1:35:25.885
Please, father, do I have to
take this new girl around?

1:35:25.918 --> 1:35:27.520
I was planning on spending
time with my friends.

1:35:27.554 --> 1:35:29.856
Besides, they're all the same.

1:35:29.890 --> 1:35:31.959
They all think because I am the
prince

1:35:31.992 --> 1:35:33.527
that they should be my princess.

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:36.196
I understand, believe me, I
do.

1:35:36.229 --> 1:35:38.132
But her father's head of the CIA

1:35:38.164 --> 1:35:40.033
and he's on a most important
tour

1:35:40.065 --> 1:35:43.804
and he has asked she
be escorted for safety.

1:35:44.938 --> 1:35:48.542
They have their own Secret
Service and Marines for that.

1:35:48.574 --> 1:35:51.878
It is not the same as
having someone your own age,

1:35:51.912 --> 1:35:54.815
who can show you safely around
the city.

1:35:57.516 --> 1:36:01.921
Okay, but I wanna be like Tom
Canty

1:36:01.954 --> 1:36:03.556
in "The Prince and the Pauper."

1:36:03.590 --> 1:36:05.159
I will do it if

1:36:06.092 --> 1:36:09.796
I can pretend to be someone
who works here at the palace,

1:36:09.829 --> 1:36:11.297
like my own valet.

1:36:11.331 --> 1:36:11.998
Huh?

1:36:12.032 --> 1:36:13.367
But you don't have a valet.

1:36:13.399 --> 1:36:14.167
Ah, they don't know that.

1:36:14.201 --> 1:36:15.569
They think all royalty has
valet.

1:36:19.005 --> 1:36:22.943
But don't you think
she might recognize you?

1:36:22.975 --> 1:36:25.545
I mean, they do have TV in the
States.

1:36:26.947 --> 1:36:30.417
No problem, I will change my
hair

1:36:30.449 --> 1:36:32.853
or wear glasses like
Clark Kent or something.

1:36:32.886 --> 1:36:33.887
I'll figure it out.

1:36:33.921 --> 1:36:37.291
Please, let me be a
regular teenager for once.

1:36:38.057 --> 1:36:41.194
I'd like to see what
someone thinks of just me,

1:36:41.228 --> 1:36:42.128
not my title.

1:36:44.029 --> 1:36:47.000
Okay, but, the Secret Service

1:36:47.033 --> 1:36:48.335
must be aware of what's
happening.

1:36:48.368 --> 1:36:50.838
They must know that it's really
you,

1:36:50.871 --> 1:36:53.306
for your safety and for hers.

1:36:55.041 --> 1:36:56.976
I wish that I had thought
of something like this

1:36:57.010 --> 1:36:58.579
when I was your age.

1:36:58.612 --> 1:37:00.381
Thank you, father, thank you.

1:37:01.581 --> 1:37:02.449
May I?

1:37:03.617 --> 1:37:04.918
But of course.

1:37:06.453 --> 1:37:09.156
Oh, "The Prince and the
Pauper."

1:37:13.393 --> 1:37:15.261
And she really is a princess

1:37:15.295 --> 1:37:18.932
and my exquisite granddaughter.

1:37:21.301 --> 1:37:25.439
So, now that the position of
First Lady

1:37:25.471 --> 1:37:29.942
has been fulfilled by this
capable, wonderful young woman,

1:37:29.975 --> 1:37:33.479
I have a question that I've
been meaning to ask you

1:37:33.512 --> 1:37:38.085
for years and I do so hope
that you will say yes.

1:37:42.655 --> 1:37:44.457
Will you be my queen?

1:37:47.226 --> 1:37:48.929
Please do say yes to us.

1:37:50.930 --> 1:37:51.998
You have to do it.

1:37:52.032 --> 1:37:54.902
She does, she is a queen.

1:37:56.970 --> 1:37:57.905
Yes!

1:38:10.582 --> 1:38:13.653
Kate Morales and King
Maximilian

1:38:13.686 --> 1:38:17.256
celebrated their one year
wedding anniversary today.

1:38:17.289 --> 1:38:20.193
They will be hosting
President Taylor Brooks

1:38:20.225 --> 1:38:23.296
and First Lady Cameron Brooks,

1:38:23.329 --> 1:38:26.332
as they discuss the resources
agreement

1:38:26.365 --> 1:38:28.469
between our two countries.

1:38:31.604 --> 1:38:33.073
Ah.

1:38:35.507 --> 1:38:36.342
That should be
enough.

1:38:38.677 --> 1:38:39.512
Very heavy.

1:38:40.747 --> 1:38:43.918
Oh, I can't wait to see Taylor
and Cameron at the dinner.

1:38:45.518 --> 1:38:46.552
One, two, three.

1:38:46.586 --> 1:38:50.090
I have my own little
dressers here, I love it.

1:38:50.122 --> 1:38:51.925
I needed that in Washington.

1:38:54.159 --> 1:38:56.563
Okay, everybody back to
business.

1:38:56.595 --> 1:38:59.699
The Lineage of Charlemagne,
what year was he reigning?

1:38:59.733 --> 1:39:01.234
Yes?

1:39:01.266 --> 1:39:02.068
Perfect!

1:40:05.398 --> 1:40:07.501
On your mark, I mean on
your mark, get set, go.

1:40:07.533 --> 1:40:10.737
Have I gotten rid of
my stringy neck, Nina?

1:40:10.770 --> 1:40:12.706
Oh, there's Jupiter.

1:40:15.140 --> 1:40:16.108
Are we gonna do this?

1:40:16.141 --> 1:40:17.243
Yes, we are.

1:40:17.277 --> 1:40:18.145
Oh, my.

1:40:20.079 --> 1:40:21.015
Huh, huh.

1:40:22.715 --> 1:40:25.284
Okay, all right.

1:40:29.288 --> 1:40:30.157
I'm so sorry.

1:40:33.193 --> 1:40:33.860
Was that an action?

1:40:33.894 --> 1:40:35.028
That was great, I had no idea.

1:40:35.061 --> 1:40:37.497
This has to do with the
arrangement that we had with

1:40:38.664 --> 1:40:39.733
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
hi.

1:40:46.605 --> 1:40:48.341
Sorry, Sergeant.

1:40:49.708 --> 1:40:50.844
I looked straight-

1:40:53.479 --> 1:40:54.814
I thought you were friends.

1:40:54.847 --> 1:40:55.716
Ah!

1:40:56.649 --> 1:40:58.752
I totally blew that line.

1:40:59.519 --> 1:41:01.488
- Follow me, baby.
- They got it.

1:41:02.287 --> 1:41:04.356
I have no idea, I
thought we were cuddling.

1:41:04.390 --> 1:41:08.195
I'm doing that and hugging
her, it's just weird.

1:41:08.228 --> 1:41:09.229
Sniff, sniff.

1:41:09.261 --> 1:41:10.596
Mm-mm , not yet.

1:41:10.630 --> 1:41:11.465
Really?

1:41:11.497 --> 1:41:12.298
Not yet.

1:41:12.332 --> 1:41:13.166
What is that then?

1:41:13.198 --> 1:41:14.467
You hum, hum.

1:41:14.501 --> 1:41:15.569
Oh, yes, okay.

1:41:15.601 --> 1:41:18.305
She can't hear you,
Preston, she can't hear you.

1:41:18.337 --> 1:41:20.539
What is your name again?

1:41:24.844 --> 1:41:26.814
You're fired, get out of here.

1:41:33.552 --> 1:41:35.287
One more time.

1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:36.155
Yes.
