00:04.768 --> 00:07.470
Te
to tell your mothers

00:07.504 --> 00:09.639
when you decide to make
a big decision like this?

00:09.673 --> 00:10.907
Big decision like what?

00:10.941 --> 00:12.809
That you three
were living together?

00:12.843 --> 00:14.799
I can't tell her I want to go.
And I can't stay.

00:14.833 --> 00:16.541
Geez, she just
lost a baby.

00:16.576 --> 00:19.840
So did I.

00:19.874 --> 00:22.697
I'm here to ask you if you could
please come back to work.

00:22.726 --> 00:24.688
It is too late.
I need you.

00:24.718 --> 00:26.448
I can't live
with your mistakes.

00:26.482 --> 00:27.512
I guess this is it.

00:30.870 --> 00:32.500
You can't be
in Florida already.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.364
We're at Toby's
grandmother's house.

00:34.398 --> 00:35.497
Grace would never
cheat on me.

00:35.531 --> 00:36.725
And I would never
cheat on her.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.492
She's on a medical mission.
Who would she cheat with?

00:38.527 --> 00:40.358
I don't know what
I was thinking.

00:40.393 --> 00:42.491
You can't just sleep
with every guy you meet.

00:42.526 --> 00:44.592
Is Grace home?
Are you Daniel?

00:44.626 --> 00:46.825
Jack really doesn't want
to go to Arizona to school.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.729
Well, thank you for letting me know, Madison.

00:48.763 --> 00:51.564
I met somebody else.
Obviously.

00:51.598 --> 00:52.665
Stay with me.

00:52.700 --> 00:53.699
I can't.

00:54.535 --> 00:56.434
Of course you can.

00:56.469 --> 00:57.569
Thanks for coming over.

00:57.604 --> 00:58.603
I'll see you two.

01:09.574 --> 01:11.373
Daddy!

01:11.407 --> 01:13.673
Hey, little man,
you want to help Daddy cook?

01:15.475 --> 01:16.575
Hi, Amy.

01:17.475 --> 01:18.541
Hi.

01:19.842 --> 01:21.709
I think your little man
may have a fever.

01:23.812 --> 01:25.745
I hope not,

01:25.780 --> 01:29.415
but I'm going to call the doctor's
office just to see if they're still open.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.349
He just seemed
cranky at the nursery.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.649
I didn't realize that he might not have been feeling well.

01:34.684 --> 01:35.851
He's probably just teething.

01:40.522 --> 01:42.821
I don't think he has a fever.
He doesn't feel warm to me.

01:42.856 --> 01:44.590
He felt warm to me.

01:44.624 --> 01:47.358
Ugh, I'm getting a recording.
They've already closed.

01:47.392 --> 01:49.526
So take him in the morning.
If he's sick.

01:49.561 --> 01:51.694
He is sick,
the question is just how sick.

01:51.728 --> 01:53.728
We should probably just take
him to the emergency room now

01:53.762 --> 01:55.829
because the later it gets,
the worse it gets.

01:55.864 --> 01:58.531
What, are you one of those
Munchausen mothers?

01:58.565 --> 02:01.332
He's fine.
Aren't you, John?

02:01.367 --> 02:02.467
I don't think he's fine.

02:02.501 --> 02:04.736
Look at him.
This is not an emergency.

02:04.771 --> 02:06.671
This does not require
an emergency room.

02:08.441 --> 02:09.707
Do you have a thermometer?

02:09.741 --> 02:12.442
I don't know if I brought the thermometer over here,
did I?

02:12.476 --> 02:14.310
I don't have one, no.

02:14.344 --> 02:16.644
Well, I could go get one or go
get it from my house, but...

02:16.679 --> 02:18.680
I know he has a fever,
just a slight fever,

02:18.714 --> 02:20.649
but he has a fever.
I can feel it.

02:20.683 --> 02:24.419
Maybe, but I really don't think he's all that sick, Amy.

02:24.453 --> 02:26.454
He'll be fine.
I'm going to finish dinner.

02:26.488 --> 02:28.356
(SCOFFS)

02:28.390 --> 02:29.624
You want me to go
get a thermometer?

02:29.659 --> 02:30.725
I can go get
a thermometer.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.727
I'll go over to your dad's
house after we eat.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.562
It's just that
if he has an ear infection,

02:34.596 --> 02:36.331
it could get worse
really quickly.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.399
Has he ever had an ear infection?
Yes.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.800
You never told me anything about an ear infection.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.368
When did he have
an ear infection?

02:41.403 --> 02:42.470
I'm sure I mentioned it.

02:42.504 --> 02:44.504
I don't think so.
I think so.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.039
If you had
mentioned it to me,

02:46.074 --> 02:48.642
I would have gone with you to the
doctor or emergency room or whatever.

02:48.677 --> 02:52.513
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay,
the first year, no, you wouldn't have,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.381
and then last year, maybe.

02:54.415 --> 02:56.550
But I wouldn't have
wanted to take you with me

02:56.584 --> 02:58.452
because I get stared at
enough at those places.

02:58.486 --> 02:59.686
Why?

02:59.720 --> 03:01.554
Why? Because
I'm not married

03:01.589 --> 03:04.723
and obviously I'm a teenager and I have a baby

03:04.757 --> 03:07.592
and people don't think teenagers
can take care of sick babies.

03:07.626 --> 03:11.462
People stare at me and ask me stupid questions and...

03:11.496 --> 03:13.397
You know how it is.
People do that anyway.

03:13.431 --> 03:14.531
No, I don't
know how it is.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.566
They don't stare at me or ask me stupid questions.

03:16.601 --> 03:19.535
Of course,
I've never been to the emergency room as a parent.

03:19.569 --> 03:20.736
I'm going to finish dinner.

03:20.770 --> 03:22.638
(SCOFFS)

03:22.672 --> 03:24.606
Is it possible that
they're staring at you

03:24.640 --> 03:29.545
and asking you stupid questions like,
"Is the kid really sick?"

03:29.579 --> 03:30.779
I'll go get the thermometer.

03:30.814 --> 03:32.447
And if he doesn't
have a temperature,

03:32.482 --> 03:33.548
are we still going to
the emergency room?

03:33.583 --> 03:34.650
No.
He's fine.

03:35.585 --> 03:36.685
Fine, then if he gets worse,

03:36.719 --> 03:38.520
you can take him
to the emergency room.

03:38.554 --> 03:39.788
Fine, I'll be
happy to do that.

03:39.822 --> 03:41.389
Not happy,
but I'll do that.

03:41.424 --> 03:42.691
You can take him
all by yourself if you want.

03:42.725 --> 03:45.327
If he needs to be taken
to the emergency room,

03:45.361 --> 03:46.728
I will take him.
All by myself.

03:46.762 --> 03:48.396
Have fun.

03:48.697 --> 03:50.531
Ow.

03:50.566 --> 03:52.367
Come on, Ricky.
I'll go with you.

03:52.401 --> 03:55.403
"Ow" does not mean we need
to go to the emergency room.

03:55.437 --> 03:56.537
I'll handle it.

03:56.572 --> 03:58.439
What's the doctor's name?
Dr. Hightower?

03:58.473 --> 03:59.506
Yes.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.510
I've already called her.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.744
That's why you're
getting the message,

04:04.778 --> 04:06.546
because they've already
closed for the night.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.447
Hi. This is
Ricky Underwood,

04:08.481 --> 04:10.349
my son might have
an ear infection

04:10.383 --> 04:13.551
and I'm wondering if you can call in
a prescription for him or something.

04:13.585 --> 04:15.753
My number is 555-0199.

04:17.456 --> 04:18.656
I don't know if
they know who you are.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.358
I think you have to call back and say John's name.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.591
And maybe my name.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.696
You don't have my name on his medical records?

04:24.730 --> 04:27.399
Yes, Ricky, your name
is on his...

04:27.433 --> 04:29.334
Hi. This is Ricky Underwood.

04:29.369 --> 04:33.706
My son's name is John and he's also my wife Amy's son,
Amy Juergens, so...

04:33.741 --> 04:35.575
I don't think
he's all that sick,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.410
but she thinks he has an ear infection,
so I'm trying...

04:38.679 --> 04:40.513
I got cut off.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.715
You can't leave a long message at this doctor's office?

04:43.384 --> 04:46.452
Um, I think they leave a number for the service

04:46.487 --> 04:48.754
you're supposed to call if you have an emergency.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.556
I'll call back and get that.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.557
And...
And what? I'll call back.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.759
What?

04:54.793 --> 04:57.461
You said,
"My wife Amy's son."

04:57.496 --> 04:59.664
No, I don't think so.
Uh-huh.

04:59.698 --> 05:02.266
I did not call you my wife.
You're not my wife.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.467
We have an agreement
that no one here

05:03.502 --> 05:04.535
is going to be
husband and wife.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.411
Ow.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.615
Yeah. Ow.

I got a thermometer.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.481
Come on,
talk to me.

05:44.516 --> 05:45.616
I'm studying.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.351
Take a break.
Talk to me.

05:47.385 --> 05:48.386
I'm studying.

05:52.558 --> 05:53.724
I brought you
a candy bar.

06:01.633 --> 06:04.435
Amy, I didn't mean anything
when I said that.

06:04.469 --> 06:06.437
- Yeah, I know.
- Well, good.

06:06.471 --> 06:08.506
Then if you know,
why are you so upset?

06:08.540 --> 06:10.308
I don't care if
you don't marry me.

06:10.342 --> 06:11.376
I don't want to
marry you either.

06:11.410 --> 06:12.711
Then why are you so upset?

06:12.745 --> 06:14.313
Because I'm upset.

06:14.347 --> 06:15.614
<i>JOHN ON BABY MONITOR:
Ow!</i>

06:16.616 --> 06:17.650
I'll get him.

06:18.619 --> 06:20.653
Yeah, you will get him,

06:20.687 --> 06:22.655
and if he has a temperature,
you will take him to the emergency room.

06:22.689 --> 06:24.390
If his temperature
is so high

06:24.425 --> 06:26.426
that he needs to go
to the emergency room.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.734
(SIGHING)

06:35.437 --> 06:37.572
Thank you.
Sure.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.674
I thought you'd come by the house this weekend.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.775
I couldn't.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.544
You could.
You just didn't.

06:43.479 --> 06:45.414
I didn't
because I couldn't.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.548
Well, why couldn't you?

06:46.582 --> 06:50.418
We had a very
busy weekend.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.520
Oh, yeah?
What'd you do?

06:52.555 --> 06:55.757
Things that we
probably shouldn't have.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.459
Or I shouldn't
have, anyway.

06:58.494 --> 07:01.429
Then I guess things
aren't so bad after all.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.330
Good. That's good news.

07:03.365 --> 07:05.432
No, that's not good news.
Things are worse than ever.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.334
Worse how?

07:07.368 --> 07:09.436
Dad, I haven't changed my mind.
I still want out.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.337
Doesn't sound
like you want out.

07:11.372 --> 07:14.407
If you wanted out you wouldn't have
done whatever you did all weekend.

07:14.441 --> 07:16.308
I couldn't say no.

07:16.343 --> 07:18.677
You could. You just didn't.

07:18.711 --> 07:20.578
If you want to add
to the list of reasons

07:20.613 --> 07:21.679
why you can't get
out of your marriage,

07:21.714 --> 07:23.314
add this weekend.

07:23.349 --> 07:25.516
(CHUCKLES) You're really
not going anywhere now.

07:26.452 --> 07:27.852
Why not?

07:27.886 --> 07:30.621
(SIGHS) Did you not understand the
vows you took when you got married?

07:30.656 --> 07:32.757
That was then.
This is now.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.692
That was forever.

07:34.726 --> 07:37.495
I do not want
to be married.

07:37.529 --> 07:39.464
I don't have to be married.
I don't.

07:39.498 --> 07:40.732
Yeah, you do.

07:40.766 --> 07:43.468
(EXHALES) Dad,
don't you understand?

07:43.503 --> 07:46.572
I'm just so unhappy.

07:48.576 --> 07:50.577
(SIGHING)
I understand. Believe me.

07:50.611 --> 07:54.681
But you have some control over that.
You just choose to be happy.

07:54.716 --> 07:58.519
Choosing to be happy is choosing to leave Adrian.
It's one and the same.

07:58.554 --> 07:59.821
Choosing to be happy
has nothing to do

07:59.855 --> 08:02.457
with leaving or
not leaving Adrian.

08:02.491 --> 08:05.327
You are not going to leave Adrian.
I'm not gonna let you.

08:05.361 --> 08:08.563
I can't be married to Adrian and be happy.

08:08.597 --> 08:11.465
I disagree.
It's just a matter of making up your mind

08:11.500 --> 08:13.435
you're going to be happy
no matter what.

08:13.469 --> 08:14.635
That's insane.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.437
And what is this?

08:16.471 --> 08:18.539
You're not happy.
You don't want to be married either.

08:18.574 --> 08:20.374
No, I'm happy.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.543
I'm a happy man.

08:22.577 --> 08:25.546
Now, would I be happier
if Betty suddenly decided

08:25.580 --> 08:27.381
that she didn't want to be
married to me anymore?

08:27.415 --> 08:30.316
Yes. Is she going
to do that? No.

08:30.351 --> 08:32.352
So am I going to be unhappy the rest of my life?

08:32.385 --> 08:34.520
Yes.
No.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.388
It's just
mind over matter.

08:36.423 --> 08:38.690
I'm not going to make myself miserable,
or more miserable,

08:38.725 --> 08:39.825
by being unhappy.

08:39.859 --> 08:42.460
Would you have married Betty if you had realized

08:42.494 --> 08:43.595
Camille was
in love with you?

08:44.730 --> 08:46.531
(SIGHS)

08:46.565 --> 08:48.667
You live in some
fantasy world.

08:48.701 --> 08:52.337
I talked to Camille.
Camille is definitely not in love with me.

08:52.371 --> 08:53.739
I don't believe that.
Did she say that?

08:53.773 --> 08:56.475
Yeah. Pretty much.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.410
Did you call her
or did you go see her?

08:58.445 --> 08:59.478
I talked to her.

08:59.512 --> 09:00.580
On the phone or in person?

09:00.614 --> 09:02.348
None of your business.

09:02.382 --> 09:03.750
So you went to go see her?

09:03.784 --> 09:05.752
I can't believe
I ever listened to you.

09:05.787 --> 09:08.489
I could have made a complete idiot out of myself.

09:08.523 --> 09:09.757
Camille is not
in love with me

09:09.791 --> 09:12.293
and I'm not in love
with anyone but my wife.

09:12.328 --> 09:13.662
Me neither.

09:13.696 --> 09:15.631
But that doesn't mean I want to
be married and neither do you.

09:15.665 --> 09:18.334
You may not want to be,
but you are and so am I.

09:18.368 --> 09:19.602
I don't want to
be married, okay?

09:19.636 --> 09:21.604
I don't have to be married.

09:21.639 --> 09:22.772
I can get a divorce.

09:23.574 --> 09:24.707
No, you can't.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.311
What about an annulment?

09:28.345 --> 09:29.679
After last week?

09:29.713 --> 09:31.381
I seriously doubt it.

09:32.349 --> 09:33.583
(SIGHS)

09:33.617 --> 09:34.684
Do we have to do this?

09:34.718 --> 09:37.520
He barely, barely
has any fever at all.

09:37.554 --> 09:38.755
He obviously has
an ear infection.

09:38.789 --> 09:40.724
He keeps holding
his ears and saying, "Ow."

09:40.758 --> 09:43.359
So we can take him
to the doctor tomorrow.

09:43.394 --> 09:45.428
The doctor who hasn't bothered calling me back.

09:45.463 --> 09:47.464
You never called back and got
the number for the service

09:47.498 --> 09:49.566
that you have to call
if there's an emergency.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.668
Oh, yeah, well,
there's not an emergency.

09:51.703 --> 09:53.470
There will be if we wait.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.672
I never knew you were so
nervous about this stuff.

09:55.707 --> 09:57.441
Are you just
insisting on doing this

09:57.475 --> 09:58.809
because I said
I didn't want to marry you?

09:58.843 --> 10:00.444
I take it back.

10:00.478 --> 10:01.712
I do want to marry you.

10:01.746 --> 10:03.714
Not now.
Not any time soon.

10:03.748 --> 10:05.716
But I want to
want to some day.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.352
Maybe some day after we've both finished college.

10:08.386 --> 10:10.454
Yeah, well, maybe when
we've both finished college,

10:10.488 --> 10:12.555
you can ask me then and I'll see if I want to or not.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.392
Ow.
Let's go.

10:20.398 --> 10:21.498
(SIGHING)

10:21.532 --> 10:22.866
What have I gotten
myself into?

10:23.834 --> 10:25.635
Look, Grace,

10:25.669 --> 10:27.670
you have to stop
justifying having sex

10:27.705 --> 10:29.806
by saying that you're going
to marry every guy you meet.

10:29.841 --> 10:31.842
I can't. I can't
stop thinking that.

10:31.876 --> 10:34.478
If I stop thinking that,
I'm gonna feel too guilty to have sex.

10:34.513 --> 10:35.646
Then stop having sex.

10:36.881 --> 10:39.550
Or start telling
yourself the truth.

10:39.584 --> 10:43.521
You just like having sex with guys
you're attracted to that you care about.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.756
That doesn't
sound as good.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.626
I mean, it might be true
but it doesn't sound as good.

10:49.761 --> 10:51.628
And I like to believe
that any guy I sleep with

10:51.663 --> 10:53.563
is gonna stick around.

10:53.598 --> 10:56.732
Even though I know it's wrong to sleep
with a guy to get him to stick around.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.602
Mmm, I don't know.

11:01.538 --> 11:03.639
I had sex with Ben
this weekend.

11:03.674 --> 11:07.710
All weekend, 'cause I wanted to make
sure he was gonna stick around.

11:07.744 --> 11:09.445
And I still don't know
that's gonna do it.

11:11.382 --> 11:13.750
I may have to come up
with something else.

11:13.784 --> 11:16.553
Do you have any reason to doubt
that he won't stick around?

11:16.587 --> 11:20.424
It's my gut feeling that he's having
some doubts about this marriage,

11:20.458 --> 11:23.360
even though he swears
he's not going anywhere.

11:23.394 --> 11:24.761
So...

11:24.796 --> 11:26.663
I think maybe I should
do what you did

11:26.698 --> 11:29.366
and just tell Ben I'm thinking about going away.

11:29.401 --> 11:30.667
To Africa?
No.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.736
To New York.
To cosmetology school.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.538
What?

11:34.572 --> 11:36.407
Why would you do that?
Why would you go to cosmetology school?

11:36.441 --> 11:38.709
I'm not really gonna go.

11:38.743 --> 11:41.811
I'm just gonna see what his
reaction is to my going away

11:41.845 --> 11:44.480
and doing something stupid
that wouldn't be good for me.

11:44.514 --> 11:46.715
Okay, wait a minute.
That's not what I did.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.451
I went away
and I did something

11:48.485 --> 11:49.718
that was good for me
and helped others.

11:49.753 --> 11:51.754
Well, you certainly helped
Daniel, didn't you?

11:51.788 --> 11:53.655
Daniel.
Oh, geez, I have to go.

11:53.690 --> 11:55.690
I told him
I'd meet him for coffee.

12:00.896 --> 12:03.464
(SIGHS) Adrian,

12:03.498 --> 12:06.801
I think maybe you've been
watching too much daytime TV.

12:06.835 --> 12:09.403
I don't think you should
intentionally try to trick Ben

12:09.438 --> 12:11.739
into telling you how he
really feels about you.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.541
I think I'm gonna have to.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.643
Because after all that
sex last weekend,

12:16.611 --> 12:18.379
(SIGHS) I'm still not sure.

12:18.413 --> 12:20.715
What if he tells you to go to New
York and study cosmetology?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.483
Then I'll know I have
to come up with something

12:22.518 --> 12:24.418
better than sex
to keep him here.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.620
Should I ask
what that would be?

12:27.590 --> 12:28.757
No.

12:29.759 --> 12:30.825
No.

12:36.666 --> 12:40.502
You're the father. She's the mother.
It's her insurance.

12:40.536 --> 12:41.670
Yeah.

12:41.704 --> 12:43.505
We don't have
you on record.

12:43.539 --> 12:46.407
You're not on the paperwork that was
filled out when the baby was born.

12:46.442 --> 12:49.377
You know there's paperwork
that's filled out ahead of time

12:49.412 --> 12:51.379
so if John comes in
with an emergency,

12:51.413 --> 12:53.381
no one has to stop
and fill this stuff out.

12:53.415 --> 12:55.683
I don't even think
it is an emergency.

12:55.718 --> 12:58.753
And why am I filling out all
these forms if I don't have to?

12:58.788 --> 13:00.555
'Cause you didn't check
"preregistered."

13:00.590 --> 13:03.358
'Cause my wife didn't tell me
we were preregistered.

13:03.392 --> 13:04.626
So now she's your wife?

13:04.660 --> 13:07.362
Oh, geez,
did I say wife again?

13:07.397 --> 13:08.463
You said wife.

13:08.498 --> 13:10.399
She's not my wife. We just...

13:10.767 --> 13:12.534
We're both his parents.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.403
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

13:14.437 --> 13:15.704
I've got a few guesses.

13:32.321 --> 13:33.421
It's your sister.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.659
Hey, Dad, I just
wanted to let you know

13:37.693 --> 13:40.262
that Toby's grandmother
sprained her ankle

13:40.296 --> 13:41.796
in some belly dancing class.

13:41.831 --> 13:44.666
Hmm. Well, I guess it's good that you
and Toby are there to help her out.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.469
It's good for you to do something useful.
It's good to be needed.

13:47.503 --> 13:49.671
Yeah, about that...

13:49.706 --> 13:52.374
She's not here.

13:52.408 --> 13:56.312
She's there, which means she's probably
not going to be here for a while.

13:56.346 --> 13:58.647
How long is a while?
And you better not be lying to me about this.

13:58.681 --> 14:00.516
I'm not. I'm not lying.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.584
And I called you
as soon as I found out.

14:02.619 --> 14:04.386
So what's the plan now?

14:04.420 --> 14:06.455
Well, I think we're just going to hang around for a while.

14:06.489 --> 14:07.556
Hang around and do what?

14:07.590 --> 14:10.191
Well, there's lots to do.

14:10.226 --> 14:13.261
There's a pool and there's a big multiplex near here.

14:13.295 --> 14:14.562
That's great.

14:14.596 --> 14:17.498
And I have my own room
and my own TV.

14:17.532 --> 14:19.266
There's lots to do here.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.302
Uh-huh.
This is getting less educational day by day.

14:22.336 --> 14:24.337
I tell you what.
I think the best way for you to learn something

14:24.372 --> 14:26.406
is to get a job,
so get a job.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.208
But we're minors.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.643
You can work there.
I looked it up.

14:29.677 --> 14:32.345
You can use your real IDs and
get a job at 16 in that state.

14:32.379 --> 14:33.580
You might need
a copy of your GED though.

14:33.614 --> 14:35.615
You got a copy of that?
Of your phony diplomey?

14:35.650 --> 14:38.251
Yeah, but...

14:38.285 --> 14:40.320
You agreed to put money
into my account every week.

14:40.354 --> 14:42.422
Yeah.
That's when I thought you were seeing America.

14:42.457 --> 14:45.192
But now that you've retired to the Sunshine State,
I'm not doing that.

14:45.226 --> 14:46.794
So if you and Toby want to stay at his Grandma's house

14:46.828 --> 14:50.397
without his Grandma there,
which I'm none too happy about, then get a job.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.466
Doing what?

14:52.500 --> 14:53.634
I don't know,
but you send me a picture or a video of you working,

14:53.668 --> 14:55.369
or a copy of your pay stub

14:55.403 --> 14:56.570
and I'll let you continue
down this dead-end road.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.639
<i>If not, you're coming home.</i>

14:58.673 --> 15:01.208
Hopefully with an education in how an
education helps you to get a better job

15:01.243 --> 15:02.476
and more opportunities
in life.

15:02.510 --> 15:06.614
All right, all right.
We'll get jobs, geez. Goodnight.

15:06.648 --> 15:08.282
We're going to get jobs?

15:08.316 --> 15:10.217
We have an allowance.
We have a free house.

15:10.251 --> 15:12.619
What do we need jobs for?

15:12.654 --> 15:17.191
Eh, it's boring here.
Let's just go back on the road.

15:17.225 --> 15:20.361
No, we're lucky we didn't get arrested driving out here.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.530
(GROANS)
Our parents are idiots.

15:23.565 --> 15:27.334
Well, they must really be idiots
if they think we can get jobs.

15:27.368 --> 15:28.502
I mean...

15:28.536 --> 15:29.536
Especially you.

15:34.641 --> 15:37.343
Why would you come back to live here?
You love Arizona.

15:37.377 --> 15:39.244
I have a job
opportunity here.

15:39.279 --> 15:41.546
They've never found anyone
to take my job at the church,

15:41.581 --> 15:45.316
and I do miss that,
pontificating to the masses.

15:45.350 --> 15:48.186
But I've also been asked
to come into a high school

15:48.220 --> 15:50.555
where there's been a lot of trouble
and teach a class in philosophy.

15:50.589 --> 15:52.457
Sort of like the one I've been teaching at the university.

15:52.491 --> 15:54.192
At first, I didn't
even consider it

15:54.226 --> 15:55.359
but then the more
I thought about it,

15:55.394 --> 15:56.628
that kind of teaching
really interests me.

15:56.662 --> 16:00.298
It has such an immediate
and practical purpose.

16:00.332 --> 16:01.499
It's not about
pie in the sky.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.234
It's not about
life after death.

16:03.268 --> 16:04.435
It's about the
here and now.

16:04.469 --> 16:06.237
What school?
Mt. Xavier.

16:06.271 --> 16:09.573
Yeah, here and now,
you'll get beat up or mugged

16:09.607 --> 16:12.143
or shot in the hallways
or the parking lot.

16:12.177 --> 16:13.477
I could be beat up
or mugged or shot

16:13.512 --> 16:15.179
in any hallway
or parking lot.

16:15.213 --> 16:17.315
Yeah, but the chances
are better at Mt. Xavier.

16:17.349 --> 16:18.549
You don't want
to do that, Dad.

16:18.584 --> 16:20.518
Don't move back
here to do that.

16:20.552 --> 16:24.188
I'm looking forward to moving
to Arizona and going to school

16:24.222 --> 16:26.424
and living closer
to you and Mom.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.492
You can't stay late.
I told my mom we were...

16:28.527 --> 16:32.363
Reverend Stone, hi.
What are you doing here?

16:32.397 --> 16:35.266
I missed my son so much
I couldn't stay away.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.301
Hi there, young fella.

16:37.336 --> 16:38.369
Dad, this is Daniel.

16:38.404 --> 16:40.605
Daniel, this is my dad,
Reverend Stone.

16:40.639 --> 16:43.541
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:44.443 --> 16:46.644
Jack. Good to
see you again.

16:47.379 --> 16:48.513
Yeah.

16:48.547 --> 16:51.316
Oh, my. Yes.
Now I get it.

16:51.350 --> 16:53.284
Get what?

16:53.319 --> 16:54.519
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

16:54.553 --> 16:57.389
So very nice to meet
your new, uh, friend.

16:57.423 --> 16:58.623
Boyfriend.

16:59.658 --> 17:01.559
Oh, I didn't know
if it was...

17:01.593 --> 17:03.294
If I'm your boyfriend?

17:04.430 --> 17:06.231
We'll just be
in the living room.

17:06.265 --> 17:07.265
Bye.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.202
What do you get?
What's going on?

17:11.237 --> 17:13.137
A little bird told me
you were unhappy here

17:13.172 --> 17:15.174
and you wanted me and your mother to move back here

17:15.208 --> 17:17.175
because you didn't want
to go to school in Arizona

17:17.209 --> 17:19.478
and you wanted to live at home with
us next year and go to school here.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.346
A little red bird?

17:21.381 --> 17:22.614
This is why we love Madison.

17:22.648 --> 17:24.516
She's so unpredictable.

17:24.550 --> 17:27.319
But it's obvious
she cares a lot about you.

17:27.353 --> 17:30.489
And I suspect she senses that
you still care about Grace.

17:30.524 --> 17:32.525
Yeah, well, Grace
has a new boyfriend.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.462
Has it ever occurred to you
that Grace is a very fickle girl?

17:36.497 --> 17:37.497
Yes. It has.

17:48.376 --> 17:50.377
I didn't know you
were my boyfriend.

17:50.411 --> 17:51.612
No?

17:51.646 --> 17:54.181
Well, I didn't know if now that you were back home

17:54.215 --> 17:55.482
you were seeing
other girls or not.

17:55.516 --> 17:58.351
You mean,
if I'm having sex with other girls?

17:58.385 --> 18:00.253
You and other girls?

18:00.287 --> 18:03.122
No. I don't do that.

18:03.156 --> 18:04.491
Do you do that?
No.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.359
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

18:06.394 --> 18:08.161
How'd things go
today at school

18:08.196 --> 18:10.531
with your old boyfriend,
with Grant?

18:10.565 --> 18:13.167
It was fine.
We're just friends.

18:13.201 --> 18:16.404
(LAUGHS) Yeah,
I know how that works.

18:16.438 --> 18:17.572
Wait, how does that work?

18:17.606 --> 18:20.175
He doesn't want
to be just friends.

18:20.209 --> 18:22.277
He's just giving you a little shot of rejection with that,

18:22.311 --> 18:23.545
hoping you'll come back.

18:25.214 --> 18:26.314
You think?

18:26.348 --> 18:27.615
You look a little
too happy about that.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.616
No, I just...

18:29.651 --> 18:35.288
I did feel kind of rejected but I should
feel rejected after what we did, I guess.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.424
I don't think that what we did has
anything to do with you and Grant.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.325
It has to do
with you and me.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.661
Yeah, but I did have
a boyfriend at the time, so...

18:48.536 --> 18:50.270
Yeah, and?

18:55.277 --> 18:57.546
When do you think we are going to
have the chance to be alone again?

18:58.481 --> 19:00.615
(EXHALES) I don't know.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.584
I don't think we need to rush back into anything.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.386
I think we should get to know each other better.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.321
(GROANS) Do we have to?

19:06.355 --> 19:07.422
No.

19:13.595 --> 19:16.430
Daniel, do you think our relationship is gonna last?

19:16.464 --> 19:18.531
What, will I marry you?

19:18.566 --> 19:22.268
No! God no, no,
I was not asking you that. No.

19:22.302 --> 19:23.469
What were you asking?

19:23.503 --> 19:25.438
I don't know!
I was not asking you that!

19:25.472 --> 19:29.475
I think it's a little too early for us
to be making any plans together.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.578
We've got a lot more
talking to do.

19:31.612 --> 19:36.149
Yeah. Don't be ridiculous.
I did not just ask you if you wanted to marry me.

19:36.184 --> 19:37.317
I think you did.

19:37.352 --> 19:39.320
Just shut up and kiss me.

19:45.427 --> 19:48.396
Why don't you try worrying about
something else for a change?

19:48.430 --> 19:51.232
Something other than getting out of your marriage.

19:51.266 --> 19:52.467
Like where you're
going to go to college,

19:52.501 --> 19:53.534
how you're going
to earn a living.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.436
College.

19:55.471 --> 19:58.172
Why didn't I think of that?
I can get into college out of state.

19:58.207 --> 19:59.441
Or maybe even
out of the country.

19:59.475 --> 20:02.177
You're married.
She'll go with you.

20:02.212 --> 20:04.346
Yeah. Probably.

20:04.381 --> 20:07.316
So, how'd things
go at work today?

20:07.350 --> 20:09.618
How's the butcher shop?
How's business? It's okay.

20:09.652 --> 20:12.354
You know, if you wanted,
you could work at the office,

20:12.389 --> 20:14.656
get more into the business
side of things.

20:14.690 --> 20:19.360
Oh, you mean work as your assistant after school?

20:19.395 --> 20:21.229
No thanks.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.665
It wouldn't hurt for you to see what
things look like from the top down.

20:23.699 --> 20:25.367
You might like the view.

20:25.401 --> 20:29.404
Dad, honestly,
I just don't want that kind of responsibility.

20:29.439 --> 20:32.541
I don't want to be the head of a large corporation.

20:32.575 --> 20:35.477
Sausage or no sausage.

20:35.512 --> 20:39.482
Are you hoping to just inherit my
money instead of earning your own?

20:39.516 --> 20:40.649
No.

20:40.684 --> 20:42.551
Then what are you
interested in?

20:42.585 --> 20:43.719
Getting out
of my marriage.

20:46.389 --> 20:49.225
Ben, if Mercy had lived,

20:49.259 --> 20:50.693
would you still be trying
to get out of your marriage?

20:51.595 --> 20:53.262
No.

20:53.296 --> 20:55.231
You'd have stayed
married for her, right?

20:55.265 --> 20:56.599
For your daughter?
Yeah.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.267
That's the reason
I got married.

20:58.301 --> 20:59.635
Then stay married
a while longer.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.303
For you and for Adrian.

21:01.338 --> 21:04.273
Just stick it out until
maybe after high school.

21:04.307 --> 21:07.543
Give the mother of your child that much respect.

21:07.578 --> 21:10.213
I understand you
don't want to be there,

21:10.247 --> 21:12.648
but we all gotta do
what we gotta do.

21:12.683 --> 21:14.283
And I'm serious here.

21:18.356 --> 21:20.423
You could have told me
to bring my books.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.459
Some things you just have to learn on your own.

21:22.494 --> 21:24.595
Really, Amy? He's tired.

21:24.629 --> 21:27.265
Once he goes to sleep,
we're gonna take him in there

21:27.299 --> 21:29.466
and have a doctor poke around in
him just so you know he's okay?

21:29.501 --> 21:31.635
He's okay.
He's obviously okay.

21:31.670 --> 21:32.703
Ow.

21:33.471 --> 21:34.471
(SIGHING)

21:36.442 --> 21:38.610
I'm going to use the restroom.
Keep an eye on him.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.244
Fine.

21:45.484 --> 21:48.219
Is that your son?
Why?

21:48.253 --> 21:49.687
Oh, you're such
a cute family.

21:51.323 --> 21:52.355
Is that your wife?

21:52.390 --> 21:54.391
Just mind your own
business, all right?

22:10.886 --> 22:12.854
He's holding both
his ears, saying, "Ow,"

22:12.888 --> 22:14.722
so yeah, I'm sure
it's an ear infection.

22:14.757 --> 22:15.790
What's his
temperature?

22:15.825 --> 22:16.925
It's not that bad.

22:16.959 --> 22:19.026
Well, what is it?
99.9.

22:19.061 --> 22:20.962
Oh. Well.

22:20.996 --> 22:22.730
So, maybe it's not
an emergency.

22:22.765 --> 22:24.866
Don't say that.
We've been down here all night.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.002
Yeah, but Amy,
the emergency room is for emergencies.

22:28.036 --> 22:29.737
Have you called
the doctor?

22:29.771 --> 22:33.040
Ricky tried to
call her and...

22:33.074 --> 22:35.909
Oh. They're calling us.
I have to go.

22:38.145 --> 22:39.812
(EXHALING)

22:41.882 --> 22:43.749
Dr. Hightower
tracked me down.

22:43.783 --> 22:46.018
She said we could bring him in
tomorrow morning if we want.

22:46.052 --> 22:47.886
Or, as long as we're here,
we could get him checked out,

22:47.921 --> 22:50.122
but it doesn't sound
like anything serious.

22:50.157 --> 22:51.958
Yeah, well maybe
I should have talked to her.

22:51.992 --> 22:53.760
Maybe.

22:53.794 --> 22:54.995
What'd that woman
over there want?

22:55.029 --> 22:56.997
I saw her come over
and sit next to you.

22:57.032 --> 22:59.900
She wanted to know if this was
my son and if you're my wife.

22:59.935 --> 23:02.971
I told her we're never getting married,
so now she's not speaking to me.

23:03.005 --> 23:04.205
Not funny.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.910
Do you know that Amy's
at the hospital with John?

23:08.945 --> 23:10.979
She thinks he might
have an ear infection,

23:11.014 --> 23:12.914
but I think she might have just
panicked because we weren't there.

23:12.949 --> 23:14.816
No, I didn't know.
You want me to go down there?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.785
No.

23:16.819 --> 23:17.853
Did you know that Toby's
grandmother is still in New York

23:17.887 --> 23:19.721
and not with
Toby and Ashley

23:19.755 --> 23:21.089
because she sprained her ankle belly dancing?
No.

23:21.124 --> 23:22.958
You sure I shouldn't go down to
the hospital and check on Amy?

23:22.992 --> 23:24.926
Ricky's with her.

23:24.961 --> 23:26.995
Oh. Good. Good for Ricky.

23:27.029 --> 23:28.797
Maybe he'll learn there's
a lot more to being a parent

23:28.831 --> 23:30.132
than sleeping with
the baby's mother.

23:30.166 --> 23:32.868
Okay, well, I just
wanted you to know.

23:32.902 --> 23:34.836
'Cause of course you knew
and I didn't.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.838
Well, you knew about
Ashley and I didn't.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.908
Do you ever think those two could be
the reason our marriage didn't work out?

23:39.942 --> 23:42.010
Did you ever think that maybe we
just never really loved each other

23:42.045 --> 23:43.845
and that's why our marriage
didn't work out?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.949
No. We did. At one time,
we loved each other. We absolutely did.

23:46.983 --> 23:49.785
Yeah, I guess you're right.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.086
I was just reacting
to what you said.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.155
It sounded like you were
blaming the girls and not us.

23:53.189 --> 23:54.857
You mean not me.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.193
No. I blame myself, too.

23:59.095 --> 24:00.729
Goodnight, George.

24:00.763 --> 24:02.897
Goodnight, Anne.

24:03.732 --> 24:05.165
Darn it, Moose.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.736
I wish I had it all
to do over again.

24:12.107 --> 24:14.742
Oh. Sorry.
I was just going to brush my teeth.

24:14.776 --> 24:15.943
You go ahead.

24:15.977 --> 24:19.847
Thank you. I will.
I mean, it's my house.

24:19.881 --> 24:21.115
Please do.

24:22.817 --> 24:24.117
Still got company, or...

24:24.152 --> 24:25.920
You know Daniel went home.

24:25.954 --> 24:28.056
Yeah, that's right.

24:28.090 --> 24:31.192
I like your pajamas,
or whatever that's called.

24:31.226 --> 24:33.928
Whatever that's called
is none of your business.

24:33.963 --> 24:35.163
But thank you, I guess.

24:36.932 --> 24:39.034
So, what was your dad
really doing here?

24:39.068 --> 24:40.936
They're thinking
of moving back.

24:40.970 --> 24:43.005
Excellent.
You won't be needing the room for that much longer.

24:43.039 --> 24:44.173
It won't be any time soon,

24:44.207 --> 24:46.842
if they do that,
if they move back.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.143
And I doubt
they'll move back.

24:48.178 --> 24:50.946
He got offered a job
at Mt. Xavier.

24:50.980 --> 24:52.815
What, do they need someone
there for last rites?

24:52.850 --> 24:54.884
Funny, even if he
doesn't do last rites.

24:54.918 --> 24:57.220
I know. I was just
making a joke.

24:57.254 --> 25:00.790
You know, we went to the same church,
your dad's church.

25:00.824 --> 25:03.025
I remember.
I remember a lot of things.

25:04.061 --> 25:05.094
Goodnight, Jack.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.169
(SIGHS)

25:16.173 --> 25:18.140
Hi there.
Oh, hi there.

25:18.174 --> 25:19.842
You're up late.

25:19.877 --> 25:22.812
Not really. It's 9:30.

25:22.846 --> 25:26.849
I like to stay up
until 11:30.

25:26.883 --> 25:29.051
Or 12:30.

25:29.086 --> 25:32.054
Sometimes, I like
to watch the news,

25:32.089 --> 25:34.857
<i>sometimes I like to
stay up for Letterman.</i>

25:34.892 --> 25:36.125
I know. I remember.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.729
I cannot do that anymore.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.197
No, you have
responsibilities.

25:40.231 --> 25:41.765
(SIGHING)

25:41.800 --> 25:44.068
Tom, is anything wrong?

25:44.102 --> 25:47.805
Not anything wrong.
Anything wrong over here?

25:47.840 --> 25:50.741
No.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.843
You and Rachel didn't have an argument,
did you?

25:52.877 --> 25:54.745
I want to watch TV!

25:54.779 --> 25:56.813
Well, honey, the children
have school tomorrow.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.014
I mean, they need
to get their sleep.

25:58.048 --> 26:00.949
They can sleep
with the damn TV on.

26:00.984 --> 26:02.818
Tom!
What?

26:02.852 --> 26:05.887
You asked for Rachel and Ronnie
and Bonnie to move in with you.

26:05.922 --> 26:07.723
Okay, now you need
to be a grown-up

26:07.757 --> 26:10.159
and realize you can't do
everything you want to do.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.027
You have to think
about this little family

26:12.062 --> 26:13.862
that you brought
into your life

26:13.897 --> 26:15.831
and do what's best
for the kids.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.034
I thought it was
going to be fun.

26:18.068 --> 26:20.103
But it's not that fun.

26:20.137 --> 26:23.740
Not always, no. It isn't.

26:23.774 --> 26:25.975
But sometimes it can be
very rewarding, honey.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.812
And sometimes rewarding
trumps just having fun.

26:28.846 --> 26:29.980
I don't think so.

26:30.014 --> 26:31.782
(SIGHS)

26:33.785 --> 26:36.755
Hey, that's okay.
You can watch whatever that was.

26:36.789 --> 26:39.859
No, I want to hear
all about Ben.

26:39.893 --> 26:42.795
How is he?
And how's Adrian?

26:43.097 --> 26:44.965
He's all right.

26:44.999 --> 26:47.734
You want a drink?
I'm think I'm gonna have a cognac.

26:47.768 --> 26:50.737
Oh, I thought cognac
season was over.

26:50.771 --> 26:53.940
You're right.
I usually leave that stuff to the winter months,

26:53.974 --> 26:57.142
but it's a little nippy out,
so maybe a short one.

26:57.176 --> 26:58.944
Sure. Why not?

26:59.212 --> 27:00.746
Yeah. Why not?

27:03.015 --> 27:05.883
Is it me or have you been drinking a little more lately?

27:06.952 --> 27:08.986
I don't think so.
Do you think so?

27:09.755 --> 27:10.822
Maybe.

27:11.190 --> 27:12.990
Maybe just a little.

27:13.025 --> 27:15.727
But you've had so much
going on lately,

27:15.761 --> 27:19.096
with Ben and Adrian

27:19.964 --> 27:21.198
and Camille.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.035
There's nothing going on
with Camille.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.910
Well, cheers.
Yeah. Cheers.

27:38.985 --> 27:40.919
Can I ask you something?

27:40.954 --> 27:42.855
Sure, Betty, you can
ask me anything you want.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.157
Are you happy, Leo?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.160
I'm happy.

27:48.195 --> 27:50.863
I was just saying that to Ben tonight.
I'm a happy man.

27:51.097 --> 27:52.131
Good.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.167
Are you happy
you married me?

27:56.202 --> 27:58.937
Of course, Betty.
Of course I am. Why?

27:58.971 --> 28:00.205
I don't know.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.141
Are you happy
you married me?

28:05.010 --> 28:08.846
Marrying you was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.816
If something even better
could have happened to you,

28:11.850 --> 28:13.117
what do you think
that would have been?

28:13.151 --> 28:17.120
Just imagine that something even
better could have happened.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.155
What would that be?

28:19.825 --> 28:23.060
I can't imagine
something better.

28:23.095 --> 28:25.996
This is like
a fairy tale come true.

28:26.030 --> 28:29.065
That's nice. That's nice
you feel like that.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.967
It makes me feel good.

28:31.001 --> 28:34.070
Of course, I do have
some regrets in my life.

28:34.104 --> 28:36.172
Oh?
Yeah, I...

28:36.206 --> 28:39.174
I regret leaving my parents
for my boyfriend.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.109
I wish I'd listened to them.

28:41.144 --> 28:44.078
He was the biggest
mistake of my life.

28:44.112 --> 28:48.816
I didn't get to go
to high school or college

28:48.851 --> 28:53.955
and then, as you know,
I ended up doing what I felt like I had to do.

28:53.989 --> 28:55.857
Although I really didn't
even have to do it.

28:55.892 --> 28:59.828
I just couldn't think
of any other options.

28:59.863 --> 29:03.799
Yeah, I feel bad that that's what happened,
but things happen.

29:03.834 --> 29:07.671
And what you did then has nothing
to do with who you are now.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.906
You see?

29:09.941 --> 29:12.976
That's why I love
you so much, Leo,

29:13.010 --> 29:15.178
and I'm going to love you
for the rest of my life.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.916
And I'm going to start
by loving you all night long.

29:21.818 --> 29:23.119
Or we could just talk.

29:23.153 --> 29:24.887
No!

29:38.734 --> 29:40.702
Let me help you with that.
No, I'll get it.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.939
I made the mess,
or Grace and I did. I'll clean it up.

29:43.973 --> 29:45.007
No, let me help you.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.975
I've got it.

29:47.010 --> 29:49.712
Did you and Grace
have a good time?

29:49.746 --> 29:53.750
You look like
you're in a good mood.

29:53.784 --> 29:55.051
I'm in a pretty good mood.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.955
Yeah, I guess I am.

29:57.989 --> 30:00.124
I must be hungover
from our weekend together.

30:00.158 --> 30:01.893
(CHUCKLES)

30:01.927 --> 30:03.194
Yeah, me too.

30:03.228 --> 30:06.197
Look, while you're
still in a good mood,

30:06.231 --> 30:08.866
I'd like to talk to you
about something.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.168
All right, well,
let me finish up here

30:11.202 --> 30:13.904
and then we can go sit on the patio and talk.
I'd like that.

30:16.974 --> 30:20.109
Ms. Juergens and Mr.
Underwood with John Juergens?

30:25.214 --> 30:26.781
She did that on purpose.

30:26.816 --> 30:28.817
You're right.
It's a hostile environment.

30:28.851 --> 30:30.185
We can still leave.
We don't have to go in there.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.220
Are you kidding me?
After waiting here all night?

30:32.255 --> 30:35.190
We're going in there.
Get your son.

30:45.578 --> 30:46.812
I made you brownies.

30:47.814 --> 30:49.814
Well, you and me.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.350
That was very nice
of you. Thank you.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.651
You're welcome.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.754
So, what'd you want
to talk to me about?

30:55.788 --> 31:00.692
Uh... Let me just eat this brownie first.
It looks really good.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.594
Okay.

31:02.628 --> 31:06.464
Well, while I'm waiting to hear
what you have to talk to me about,

31:06.499 --> 31:08.734
there's actually something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

31:08.768 --> 31:10.736
I was wondering
if I could tell you

31:10.770 --> 31:13.806
about my plans to go to school next year.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.509
So you are gonna wait until the fall to go back to school?

31:16.543 --> 31:19.511
Let me finish.

31:19.546 --> 31:23.616
I don't want to go back to school
with you and Amy and Grace.

31:23.651 --> 31:26.753
I want to go to
another school.

31:26.787 --> 31:31.792
I want to do something useful and practical and fun.

31:33.861 --> 31:35.395
I want to go to
cosmetology school.

31:37.365 --> 31:40.633
So, what do you think?

31:40.668 --> 31:45.672
I think that's a lot different from law school,
isn't it?

31:45.706 --> 31:49.642
That doesn't mean that I can't always
go back to high school and finish later.

31:49.677 --> 31:52.379
College later,
law school later.

31:52.413 --> 31:54.348
Yeah, but you
probably wouldn't.

31:54.382 --> 31:57.484
You'd probably
end up doing what?

31:57.519 --> 32:01.489
Hair and makeup?
Working in Hollywood?

32:01.524 --> 32:03.591
In the TV or film industry?

32:03.626 --> 32:08.597
Or cosmetics. Maybe even being a
representative for some cosmetics firm...

32:09.732 --> 32:11.600
Or coming up with your
own line of cosmetics.

32:12.735 --> 32:13.768
Or doing nails.

32:14.503 --> 32:15.704
(CHUCKLES)

32:16.606 --> 32:17.739
What?

32:17.774 --> 32:21.776
Just, you never
cease to amaze me.

32:21.811 --> 32:25.613
I mean, just when I thought that you
couldn't get past what we've been through,

32:25.647 --> 32:28.582
you come up with this new

32:28.617 --> 32:32.653
and very creative plan.
Wow, I'm...

32:33.722 --> 32:36.558
I'm totally for it.

32:36.592 --> 32:38.727
Yeah, if that's what you want to do.
Go into cosmetology.

32:38.762 --> 32:40.396
Are you?

32:40.430 --> 32:41.597
Again, if that's
what you want to do.

32:41.632 --> 32:43.566
If that's what you want to do,
I totally support you.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.503
And...

32:46.537 --> 32:49.573
What if I would need to go
to New York to study?

32:49.607 --> 32:53.544
New York? Are you kidding me?
That'd be great.

32:53.578 --> 32:57.815
I mean, of course,
it wouldn't be for very long, right?

32:57.850 --> 33:02.787
It would be for just what,
a year? Two years?

33:02.821 --> 33:05.590
I don't know.
I'm just starting to look into it.

33:07.693 --> 33:10.428
I could start here

33:10.462 --> 33:12.830
and then maybe if you get into a college in New York,

33:12.865 --> 33:16.501
we could both
go together

33:16.535 --> 33:17.636
to New York to study.

33:18.438 --> 33:19.638
Yeah.

33:19.673 --> 33:22.775
But I mean, you wouldn't
want to start here

33:22.810 --> 33:24.778
and then change
schools or anything.

33:24.812 --> 33:27.614
Maybe you should
just start there, you know?

33:27.648 --> 33:29.650
Get out of here.

33:29.684 --> 33:32.685
We could sell this place and just
buy you something over there.

33:34.588 --> 33:35.688
Buy me...

33:37.658 --> 33:41.361
Buy me a place?

33:42.463 --> 33:44.631
Don't you mean
buy us a place?

33:44.665 --> 33:49.368
Yeah.
I was just so excited thinking about the future.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.404
Isn't it great?
It's just so...

33:52.473 --> 33:54.373
(SIGHS) It's so freeing.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.642
You know, I think I'm gonna
have another brownie.

33:55.676 --> 33:57.477
Oh, no, no,
don't get up.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.647
I'll get it for you, Benny.

34:02.551 --> 34:04.452
Buy me a place, huh?

34:05.688 --> 34:08.422
Education is the way out.

34:08.458 --> 34:09.725
Did you say something?
No, nothing!

34:09.759 --> 34:11.560
No, I said nothing at all.

34:11.594 --> 34:13.362
MAN: Hey, shut up
down there!

34:13.396 --> 34:14.797
I'm going to miss that.

34:14.831 --> 34:16.699
(LAUGHS)

34:22.473 --> 34:25.676
So he wouldn't mind
if I went to New York.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.710
I came down to the kitchen
where no one can hear me.

34:27.746 --> 34:30.547
Fine.
I don't care if you're upset with me or not.

34:30.581 --> 34:31.915
I know you, Jack.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.717
I know what you're thinking
even before you're thinking it.

34:33.752 --> 34:35.585
And you're thinking
if Grace dropped Grant,

34:35.621 --> 34:37.487
then she'll drop
this guy too.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.357
And then finally,
at long last, she'll be free

34:39.391 --> 34:40.491
and you'll be in
the house with her.

34:40.525 --> 34:43.460
Madison, look,
I am tired of being accused

34:43.495 --> 34:44.696
of always trying
to be with Grace.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.599
If I wanted to be with Grace,
I could be with Grace.

34:47.632 --> 34:49.534
But I don't want
to be with Grace.

34:49.569 --> 34:51.636
Yeah, right.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.371
(SIGHS) Look, she just came into the kitchen.
Can I call you back?

34:54.407 --> 34:56.507
No. You can talk
to her anytime.

34:56.543 --> 34:58.443
We have a phone curfew,
in case you've forgotten.

34:58.478 --> 35:00.412
Well, then,
I'll talk to you at school tomorrow.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.580
No!

35:03.449 --> 35:05.451
Look, Madison,
I love you.

35:05.485 --> 35:07.719
And I love that we don't have to have
sex to prove our love to each other.

35:09.522 --> 35:10.656
I'll talk to you
at school tomorrow.

35:10.690 --> 35:12.691
I wish we'd never had sex!

35:13.860 --> 35:16.428
Goodnight, Madison.

35:17.563 --> 35:18.563
Ditto.

35:19.799 --> 35:21.533
I wish we'd never had sex.

35:21.567 --> 35:23.635
I know what ditto means.

35:23.669 --> 35:25.837
Do you wish you'd never had sex with Grant, too?

35:26.606 --> 35:27.839
Yeah.

35:27.874 --> 35:30.476
And you wish you'd never
had sex with Daniel too?

35:30.510 --> 35:33.446
Or do you just wait to wish that
until the next guy comes along?

35:34.748 --> 35:36.549
I wait until the next
guy comes along.

35:38.552 --> 35:39.819
I just came down
to get my book, so...

35:41.388 --> 35:42.489
That's not your book.

35:49.363 --> 35:50.696
How do you know?

35:50.730 --> 35:52.632
You don't even look like a doctor.
Maybe you're not a doctor.

35:52.666 --> 35:54.534
Got me.
I'm just a resident.

35:54.568 --> 35:56.469
Which means, legally,
I am a doctor.

35:56.504 --> 35:58.605
But hey,
kids don't like doctors who look like doctors,

35:58.639 --> 36:00.373
so there you go.

36:00.407 --> 36:01.841
There's no ear infection.

36:01.876 --> 36:05.445
But he's holding his ears and saying,
"Ow" and he has a fever.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.715
No, he doesn't.
He only had a fever when you took his temperature.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.650
Maybe you didn't
read it right.

36:09.684 --> 36:11.385
I read it right.
I know how to take his temperature.

36:11.687 --> 36:13.621
Ow.

36:13.656 --> 36:14.690
See! I told you!

36:14.724 --> 36:16.391
He doesn't have
an ear infection.

36:16.426 --> 36:18.660
He has to! Why would
he be doing that?

36:18.695 --> 36:20.629
Um... I'm going
to take a guess.

36:20.664 --> 36:23.566
Because the two of
you can't quit arguing?

36:23.600 --> 36:26.803
You haven't noticed that when you raise your voices,
he doesn't like it?

36:26.838 --> 36:28.839
Yeah. You two better
get a handle on that.

36:28.873 --> 36:30.407
Especially if you're
going to live together.

36:31.643 --> 36:33.443
Bye, John.
Bye.

36:46.077 --> 36:49.113
You know,
I have some things of yours I should return.

36:49.148 --> 36:51.049
That's all right.
We're friends.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.383
I'm not worried about you having any of my things.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.319
I have your hospital
bracelet from med camp.

36:55.321 --> 36:57.422
Really?

36:57.456 --> 36:59.090
I thought you would have
thrown that away by now.

37:00.159 --> 37:01.292
I threw yours away.

37:01.327 --> 37:03.328
Maybe I would
have wanted that.

37:03.362 --> 37:06.230
We'll be back at med camp this summer.
You can get another one.

37:06.264 --> 37:10.134
Hey, is your new boyfriend, what's-his-name,
going to med camp?

37:10.168 --> 37:11.268
What's-his-name is Daniel.

37:11.303 --> 37:12.336
And I know
you know that.

37:12.370 --> 37:14.439
And no, he is not
going to med camp.

37:14.473 --> 37:16.173
You know why?

37:16.208 --> 37:18.309
No. Why?

37:18.343 --> 37:20.077
Because he's
already in college.

37:20.111 --> 37:21.378
He started in January.

37:21.412 --> 37:23.413
He's a year older so he got into college early.

37:23.447 --> 37:25.348
He was on spring break
when I met him.

37:25.382 --> 37:27.317
He's a freshman
in college.

37:27.352 --> 37:29.386
He's not in high school.
He's an adult.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.122
Does your mother
know this?

37:32.157 --> 37:35.259
No, she doesn't, and neither one of you
are going to tell her, and you know why?

37:35.294 --> 37:37.128
Why?
Why?

37:37.162 --> 37:39.497
Because we're friends and friends
don't rat each other out, do they?

37:41.400 --> 37:43.068
(SHOUTING) Do they?

37:45.137 --> 37:47.238
You know what, never mind.
We're not really friends.

37:47.272 --> 37:49.273
You just said that because you
wanted me to feel rejected

37:49.307 --> 37:52.076
and so I would come crawling back to you.
But guess what?

37:52.110 --> 37:53.143
It's not going to happen.

37:57.281 --> 37:58.381
It might.

37:58.415 --> 38:00.049
She's a very
fickle girl.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.383
(EXHALES)

38:04.420 --> 38:07.222
Hey, Madison's
out sick today.

38:07.256 --> 38:10.124
She wanted you to know that
she was up all night crying.

38:10.158 --> 38:13.061
About what?
About everything.

38:13.095 --> 38:15.363
Basically, she wishes she had never had sex with you,

38:15.397 --> 38:17.265
never dated you,
never met you.

38:17.299 --> 38:19.067
Is she breaking up with me?

38:19.101 --> 38:20.135
(SCOFFS) You wish.

38:20.169 --> 38:21.402
You're not getting
off that easy.

38:21.436 --> 38:23.070
If you want to
break up with her

38:23.105 --> 38:25.106
and go chasing after
your old girlfriend,

38:25.140 --> 38:26.440
then you're going to have to do the breaking up yourself.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.309
I'm not breaking up with her.

38:28.343 --> 38:30.377
Yeah, she knows that.

38:30.412 --> 38:33.446
But you and I know
that you want her to.

38:33.481 --> 38:36.116
And you're a little weasel.

38:43.089 --> 38:45.257
We're just going to have to find
a way to argue without arguing

38:45.292 --> 38:47.327
or we're going to scar John for the rest of his life.

38:47.361 --> 38:49.129
Do you have
to be dramatic?

38:49.163 --> 38:50.397
Isn't that how we got into that
argument in the first place?

38:50.431 --> 38:52.266
You're raising
your voice already.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.134
No, I'm not.
I'm not raising my voice.

38:54.169 --> 38:56.070
I know what raising
my voice sounds like.

38:56.104 --> 38:57.171
This isn't raising my voice.

38:57.206 --> 38:58.306
You are raising
your voice.

38:58.340 --> 39:00.175
I know what not raising
your voice sounds like.

39:00.209 --> 39:02.344
This is not raising your voice.
What I'm doing.

39:02.378 --> 39:04.380
Yeah, well John's smart
enough to figure out

39:04.414 --> 39:07.215
that even if you're talking like that that you're still angry.

39:07.250 --> 39:08.250
He's not a dog.

39:10.453 --> 39:12.320
(SIGHS)

39:14.156 --> 39:15.390
Maybe we just need
a bigger place.

39:15.424 --> 39:17.324
Maybe we just need to move
back to my house.

39:17.359 --> 39:19.226
The three of us?
No, John and me.

39:19.261 --> 39:21.094
You can't do that.

39:21.129 --> 39:23.363
And I wish you'd stop threatening
that every time we have an argument.

39:23.398 --> 39:25.198
I'm not threatening.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.067
I'm just saying that maybe
our place is just too small,

39:27.102 --> 39:29.069
and your voice
is just too loud.

39:29.104 --> 39:31.138
After having been raised
the way I was raised,

39:31.173 --> 39:33.308
I've worked really hard
to know what the line is

39:33.342 --> 39:37.112
when it comes to expressing my
anger or frustration or emotions.

39:37.146 --> 39:40.082
I don't think it's healthy to not
express emotions in front of John.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.451
What's he supposed to think,
that we're all happy all the time?

39:42.485 --> 39:44.152
Yes.
No.

39:44.187 --> 39:47.389
It's normal to get upset and have arguments.
It's healthy.

39:47.423 --> 39:49.257
If you don't let
things go too far.

39:49.292 --> 39:51.193
And I'm not going
to let things go too far.

39:51.227 --> 39:52.327
Oh, so it's up to you?

39:52.361 --> 39:54.296
No. I know what
my "too far" is.

39:54.330 --> 39:56.131
You have to know
what your "too far" is.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.200
But I think threatening to go back
home to your mommy and daddy

39:58.234 --> 39:59.268
is going too far.

39:59.302 --> 40:00.436
(GROANING) Ow.

40:03.073 --> 40:04.106
(SIGHING)

40:06.309 --> 40:08.143
I was just joking.

40:10.180 --> 40:12.414
I hear what you're saying.

40:12.448 --> 40:15.050
And I guess I have
to quit doing that,

40:15.085 --> 40:16.251
threatening to go home.

40:17.086 --> 40:18.153
Thanks.

40:18.187 --> 40:20.121
And I have to start
giving you more credit

40:20.156 --> 40:23.124
for knowing a little bit
more about raising John.

40:23.158 --> 40:25.059
You really have given
parenting a lot of thought.

40:25.094 --> 40:26.127
Thanks, Amy.

40:27.230 --> 40:31.065
And you're really a good dad.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.168
And some day,
you're going to make someone a really great husband.

40:33.469 --> 40:36.138
Someone?
Well, me.

40:36.172 --> 40:39.341
Which is why you keep calling me your wife.
And you know it.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.354
I think I may have
found a way out.

40:51.388 --> 40:53.022
I don't want
to hear about this.

40:53.057 --> 40:54.090
I don't think you
should get out.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.026
It's too soon and
she's too fragile.

40:56.061 --> 40:58.295
Yeah, don't you think it's a little insensitive, Ben,
to be talking like this?

40:58.329 --> 41:00.097
But it was her idea.

41:00.131 --> 41:02.199
Whatever it is,
you don't have to be so happy about it.

41:03.201 --> 41:06.137
Unless...
Unless what?

41:06.172 --> 41:08.106
Unless this is her
way of getting out.

41:08.140 --> 41:11.075
Yeah. Maybe it is.
Maybe she wants out as much as I do.

41:11.109 --> 41:12.209
Maybe the feeling
is mutual.

41:12.244 --> 41:14.178
Okay, so what's
the story?

41:14.212 --> 41:16.080
What's your way out
that was her idea?

41:16.114 --> 41:20.117
She wants to go to
cosmetology school.

41:20.152 --> 41:22.353
Adrian? Adrian, who
had a 4.0 average

41:22.387 --> 41:24.054
and wanted to
become a lawyer,

41:24.089 --> 41:26.123
now wants to go to
cosmetology school?

41:26.157 --> 41:28.058
And how does
that get you out?

41:28.093 --> 41:31.361
Because she could possibly go to
cosmetology school in New York.

41:31.396 --> 41:34.331
Uh, no. This is a lie.
I'm not buying it.

41:34.366 --> 41:36.100
Me neither.

41:36.134 --> 41:39.070
Look, she does not
want to come back here

41:39.104 --> 41:41.172
and without a high school diploma,
her options are limited.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.041
So this is what she chose.

41:43.075 --> 41:45.043
And by the way, I think
it's entirely possible

41:45.077 --> 41:48.147
that this way she gets away
from me and I get away from her

41:48.181 --> 41:52.218
and once we get away from each other,
there's no going back.

41:55.355 --> 41:58.058
Dr. Ottavi, thank you
for taking my call.

41:58.092 --> 42:02.330
I just got nervous that maybe Ben and
I should have waited a while longer.

42:03.431 --> 42:08.102
Yeah, I'm feeling
much better.

42:08.136 --> 42:14.140
In fact,
I have another question I want to ask you.

42:14.175 --> 42:17.243
Is it too soon for me to try to get pregnant again?

42:22.324 --> 42:32.324
