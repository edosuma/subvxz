01:09.736 --> 01:11.488

The reviews are in.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.156
- And?
- Someone wrote...

01:13.239 --> 01:15.700
Oh, "This app made me poke my eyes out,
thanks for nothing."

01:16.284 --> 01:18.912
But someone else wrote,
"Groovy app," so...

01:19.537 --> 01:20.705
I guess it's net neutral.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
- It's good that they're not all bad.
- True.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.330

- That's plenty.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.490
Okay.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.325
So what do you think?

01:57.742 --> 01:58.785
I think...

02:02.497 --> 02:04.415
I think all the words were there.

02:05.875 --> 02:06.875
You hate it.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.878
I bare my soul on these pages
and you hate my soul.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.965
You didn't bare your soul.
That's what I hate about it.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.634
- Say more about that.
- You wanna change the world?

02:14.717 --> 02:15.917
What about it?

02:16.302 --> 02:18.972
The world needs changing
and I'm sure that you can agree with that.

Ugh!

You talk about creating
the next big thing. What thing?

You're really going full-blown

- Yes, more than anything in the world.

You have the grades.

If you wanna stand out,
you're gonna have to rework your essay.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.249
You're gonna have to look real deep inside

You met with the counselor today, right?
How did that go?

04:02.200 --> 04:06.371
It was good. She told me that
Yale's competitive. Did you know that?

Dad, I told you not to worry about the money.
Okay, you're right. Why am I worried about money?

04:14.545 --> 04:15.964
College is free, right?

04:16.755 --> 04:17.923

Murph, do you wanna write
my admissions essay for me?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.705
We could do it like a thought exercise.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.958
I'm good, cos I'm writing mine,
because people write their own.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.168
Give me some inspiration.
What's your core theme?

I'm writing about my struggles
with dyslexia,

04:57.005 --> 04:58.715

- That's a really short essay, actually.

No, yeah, I know,

Yeah? You gonna be wearing
those plastic gloves too?

No, this is Greenwich,

- Why? What would you get out of it?
- I get the payment you're talking about.

Who knows,
maybe stepping outside of myself,

it might help me finish my essay.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.313
And who are you gonna become?

Whatever she wants me to be,

that heels are an outmoded display of

Okay, so now pull over,

10:36.052 --> 10:37.345
and here we are.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.845
This is not your high school.
Wouldn't it be weird if it was?

10:41.932 --> 10:44.685
Okay, so you can swing back
and pick me up in a few hours.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.229
You're telling me
that you would rather hang out at a...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.815

than go to a high school dance?

10:49.899 --> 10:50.899
Yes.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.610
Oh, my God. Yes.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.819
Yes, I would.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.571
- Celia.
- Gigolo.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.074
- Brooks. My name's Brooks.
- Sure.

Look, you are my responsibility,
and I cannot let you out of this car.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.204
Okay, let's define terms here.

11:03.287 --> 11:07.083
I'm not your responsibility, because
Eisenhower isn't in office anymore.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.544
Secondly, you're being paid
to hang out with me.

11:10.961 --> 11:15.174
Imagine how that makes me feel.
Like, really, really imagine it.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.300
Now do as I say.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.013
Compensation aside, I think that you and I
could have a really good time tonight.

to my high school.

You do it with panache.

Why is nobody dancing? What, is dancing
just a poor person thing now?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.524
You think people actually
go to a dance to dance?

12:13.607 --> 12:15.693
No, they come here to take photos
for their Instagram.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.570
I'm sure that's why
people have babies too.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.448

- No.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.845
I can't tell if you're doing Chandler Bing
or Napoleon Dynamite.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.722

to that door by yourself,

to the other leg.

right here, but,

it's not too big of a deal.

shouldn't be asked, okay?

and the money I need to go to Yale,

18:28.982 --> 18:31.485
and you get to practice your craft,
the art of coding.

- You haven't even been accepted yet.
- Yet.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.156
Look, worst case scenario,
I take the money,

18:36.240 --> 18:39.451
and I get ownership stake
in this here fine establishment.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.495

18:45.916 --> 18:47.793
Okay, so I've been thinking and I think

18:47.876 --> 18:50.462
that every date would be
custom built by the user,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.881
meaning that they could pick
my personality, my interests,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.717
whether I'm a listener or a talker,
if I'm funny or serious.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.138
Basically, I am a stand-in
for whatever it is that they want.

would you go check?

- No, I did, yeah.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.208

on custom Objective-C infrastructure?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.939
You're lucky I was able to salvage
some of this code from another project.

Is that it?
It is done.

Murph, this is...

20:04.620 --> 20:05.520
This is perfect.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.041
Uh-huh. In terms of functionality,
think GrubHub,

20:09.124 --> 20:11.501

app that tracks your progress.

he looks so innocent.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.143
Yeah, but that's all in the past
because you're a hooker now.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.813
- What? No, I'm not. I'm a--
- I guess that makes me your pimp.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.733
- A high-tech pimp, but a pimp nonetheless.
- No.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.360
I'm a gay teenage pimp,

20:36.735 --> 20:38.862
wearing a secondhand hoodie.
My life as I envisioned it.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.864
I am not gonna be sleeping--

20:40.948 --> 20:43.325
Yeah, I know, because if you did,
we'd both go to jail,

20:43.408 --> 20:46.495
which rhymes with Yale
and yet is so different,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.789
but you have your new rich friends
to bail you out.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.333
Okay, Murph, first of all,
I don't have any new friends.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.461
Okay? And second of all,
I'm offering my services as a chaperone.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.548
Whatever, man. What do we do now?

20:58.966 --> 21:01.760
What one does
when bringing a new product to market?

21:01.843 --> 21:04.680
Talk about it incessantly on Reddit,
until it sounds really important.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.347
What is a Reddit?

21:13.605 --> 21:16.316
- [chuckles] What's going on?
- Breakfast for two.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.859
Why?

21:17.943 --> 21:21.113
Because families eat breakfast together,
even really small ones.

21:21.196 --> 21:23.115
Next year, when you're off to college,

21:23.198 --> 21:26.952
I'll be a family of one,
so now we eat pancakes.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.664
Pancakes.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.041
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

What is going on?

21:37.504 --> 21:40.340
I haven't seen this look on your face
since Mom let you buy a motorcycle.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.217
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.636
I saw it in the mail this morning
and I just had to open it.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.225

because I teach there.

Dad, you teach a continued ed
night class, two Wednesdays a month.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.855
I don't think
that had anything to do with...

32:53.888 --> 32:55.541
the beautiful face that's attached to it.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.850
There you go,
so we're both shallow teenagers.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.018
It would appear so.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.270
- You're really sweet.
- Yeah.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.898
- Can I have some of that, please?
- Whoa! No! No way.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.906
[laughs] So, I might be able to help.
My dad knows the president.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.117
- Of what country?
- Of Yale.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.619
Um, they've been playing poker,
like forever,

33:16.703 --> 33:19.330
and I guess my dad's been losing to him
for ten years,

33:19.414 --> 33:20.665
in case I ever wanted to go.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.959
So, the fact I don't wanna go
is kind of a sore point.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.947
I don't get it,
rich people all know each other.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.796
- I don't even know who my barber is.
- Okay, do you want my help or not?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.048
Yes. A hundred times, yes.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.509
Well, no promises,
but I can check with him.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.761
What? Are you serious? Wow.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.098
Thank you. All I got for you is wow.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.683
Well, I'm a woman of much wow.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.227
Hey, man,
I'll give you 50 bucks for your car.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.353
[giggles]

33:44.022 --> 33:46.232
- Oh, you think that's funny?
- Yeah, I do.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.445
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.629
Whoa.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.864
What's with the get-up?

33:53.239 --> 33:57.368
Uh, I figured if I'm going to Yale,
I'd better start stepping it up.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.246
Hey, what's going on
with all the late nights lately?

34:00.329 --> 34:05.877
Uh, you know, the usual teenage stuff,
school projects, dances, 24-hour raves.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.545
Hm. Atta boy.

34:07.628 --> 34:10.922
Do you think you could clean up one day?
I mean, it's starting to look a little...

34:11.466 --> 34:13.134
condemned in here.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.385
I'm gonna get to it.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.262
I could help you, if you want.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.388
I think I do.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.099
And actually, you have helped.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.810
I submitted a collection
of my short stories of this fellowship,

34:22.893 --> 34:25.938
because you were
so terribly and vividly mean to me.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.608
So, thank you for being a supportive

34:29.108 --> 34:30.109
asshole.

34:31.110 --> 34:31.944
Anytime.

34:33.987 --> 34:35.697
- Good night, Pops.
- Good night, buddy.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.243
[sighs]

34:43.414 --> 34:46.501
Hey, look, little Brooks is almost
a third of the way to his goal.

34:46.583 --> 34:50.129
If I keep getting business like this, I'm
gonna be at little Yale by the summertime.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.672
That's great, man. Really.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.382
What is that? What...

34:55.259 --> 34:56.344
You seem distant.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.722
Well, I guess I am.

35:00.306 --> 35:03.726
We just usually have stuff to talk about,
because we spend time together,

35:03.810 --> 35:05.186
or we used to.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.856
So, distance is making us distant,
which makes sense to me.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.484
Huh.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.570
But it's fine, really. We're gonna grow
apart when we go to college,

35:14.654 --> 35:16.697
so we might as well
get the process started now.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.449
Okay, well,

35:19.700 --> 35:20.701
how about this?

35:20.785 --> 35:22.537
I'm totally
booked out tonight and tomorrow,

35:22.620 --> 35:25.957
but I am completely free on Saturday
and I will make sure it stays that way,

35:26.040 --> 35:27.917
if you promise to go to Tino's with me.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.201
Count me in.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.047
Oh, hey, can we hit that new
zombie-themed escape room afterwards?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.257
Yes, I am in.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.174
All right.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.300
Hello again.

35:37.343 --> 35:40.054
- Hey, I'll take a--
- Tuna melt on seven grain.

35:40.138 --> 35:40.972
Yeah.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.350
- Uh, thanks.
- Murph is my given name.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.936
Oh, I guess I gotta give you this.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.564
I just remembered that
this is when you usually come by.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.441
- Yeah.
- We get paid a dollar above minimum wage,

35:52.525 --> 35:55.111
so we're encouraged
to provide top service.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.489
Uh, well, thanks, Murph.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.871
- What?
- You were blushing.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.998
Who is that? Huh?

36:07.081 --> 36:09.917
Hey, yo, I work at White Castle, okay?
You know what that means,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.461
I see some of the finest bitches
in the world every damn day,

36:12.962 --> 36:17.049
and, Pops, I gotta tell you
with the utmost respect,

36:17.508 --> 36:18.508
your daughter,

36:18.551 --> 36:22.597
she's got to be one of the finest bitches
I have ever seen in my entire life,

36:22.680 --> 36:26.309
and I've been to the Westminster Dog Show,
okay? All right.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.477
[cell phone vibrating]

36:29.187 --> 36:30.563
[grunting]

36:30.688 --> 36:32.398
I have to take the browns
to the Super Bowl,

36:32.481 --> 36:34.775
and by that I mean
I gotta take a hot deuce, right?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.402
Daddy-o, where the bathroom at?

36:36.777 --> 36:38.738
It's down the hall on the left.

36:38.821 --> 36:39.655
Ooph.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.700
I love you, baby.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.206
Hey, Celia.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.166
<i>What's up, Vanilla? What are you up to?</i>

36:50.249 --> 36:52.877
I'm getting paid to be a douche
to a girl's parents,

36:52.960 --> 36:56.047
so that they're more accepting of her real
boyfriend when they actually meet him.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.090
<i>Um, parents have it hard.</i>

36:58.674 --> 37:00.927
<i>What are you doing tomorrow?
Like early afternoonish?</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:04.096
What, for my best customer?
I'm totally free. Why, what's up?

37:04.430 --> 37:05.681
<i>I may have got you an interview</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:08.476
<i>with the Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions at Yale.</i>

37:08.559 --> 37:10.394
Oh, my God, Celia,
I don't know what to say.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.729
<i>Well, why don't you try?</i>

37:11.812 --> 37:15.191
Celia Lieberman, you make flowers blossom.

37:15.274 --> 37:17.985
You are the reason trees have leaves.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.321
You are a goddess.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.241
<i>Aw! That is absolutely correct.</i>

37:23.324 --> 37:25.785
- What time should I pick you up?
<i>- You shouldn't.</i>

37:25.868 --> 37:28.704
<i>This is your day, but it's my rules,
so I'm gonna pick you up at one.</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:31.082
I'll text you my address.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.750
<i>Bye.</i>

Woo hoo! Yo, man, that number two
turned to a number five real quick.

37:48.766 --> 37:49.976
Where the plunger at?

37:54.146 --> 37:55.314
[door closes]

38:00.361 --> 38:02.989
What? I'm trying to look smart.
Do I look too smart?

38:03.656 --> 38:05.783
It looks like someone
took a J. Crew store,

38:05.866 --> 38:07.952
put it in a cannon
and shot it at your face.

38:08.035 --> 38:10.162
Thank you, so much.
I mean, what do I do?

38:10.246 --> 38:11.330
I don't understand clothes.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.499
They're completely irrelevant
yet somehow important.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.709
Lose the glasses.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.919
Go on, give it to me.
Okay, that's better.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.630
Do you need the cardigan?
I'm gonna answer that. You don't need it.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.257
- I like the cardigan.
- No one likes it.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.552
- Intellectual people wear cardigans.
- You do not look intellectual.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.345
For the love of God, come on.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.641
Oh, you know, what you do need though,
you need a mani.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.060
That is a fight for another day,
my friend.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.564
Wow, who would have thought that
Celia Lieberman could be so comforting?

38:36.647 --> 38:39.900
It's like underneath all these layers
of angst and sarcasm,

38:39.984 --> 38:41.902
there might actually be a human being.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.157
Oh.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.451
Thank you.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.204
You're welcome.

I have been an astronaut, a cowboy

I'm supposed to be right now.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.020
Brooks Rattigan.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.023
Dean's ready for you now.

40:04.985 --> 40:05.985
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.655
- [Celia] Hey.
- Yeah?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.448
You're gonna kill it.

40:10.699 --> 40:11.699
You know,

40:12.201 --> 40:13.411
unless you don't.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.421
Mr. Rattigan, a pleasure to meet you.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.214
- Take a seat.
- Yes, sure.

40:26.882 --> 40:30.594
So, tell me about yourself.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.304
Yeah, I'd love to.

40:32.388 --> 40:35.141
What says more about a person
than numbers, right?

40:35.724 --> 40:38.227
So, the first time I took the SAT
I got a 1510,

40:38.310 --> 40:40.980
and that was because I butchered
the math section, but

40:41.063 --> 40:44.108
I knuckled down,
and I put work over parties,

40:44.692 --> 40:47.903
and I managed to bump it up to a 1570
on my second time around.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.864
That's too bad.
I'm sorry?

40:52.408 --> 40:55.286
Well, that you missed out on parties.
Parties are fun.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.789
It's important to enjoy life,
especially at your age.

40:58.873 --> 41:03.502
With respect, it's not exactly the message
that we get from our parents and teachers.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.045
I grant you that, yeah.

41:05.921 --> 41:06.755
Well...

41:07.047 --> 41:10.634
Mr. Rattigan, academically speaking, you
seem like the perfect candidate for Yale.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.095
Thank you, sir.
Coming from you that means a lot.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.890
But I want to know
a little something about you.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.601
Tell me something about yourself,
activities, hobbies.

41:18.684 --> 41:22.855
Sure, well I'm in French Club,
I'm a National Honors Society, and--

41:22.938 --> 41:23.772
No.

41:24.398 --> 41:26.692
No, I don't mean the things that you do,

41:26.775 --> 41:28.986
because you think they look good
on an application.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.239
What are some of your interests
outside of school?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.866
Outside of school?

41:33.949 --> 41:37.536
Example, I had a kid in here yesterday,
right there,

41:38.120 --> 41:41.499
and he breeds trash-eating microbes
in his spare time.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.834
It's fascinating stuff.

41:44.460 --> 41:48.380
I don't... breed trash-eating microbes.

41:48.464 --> 41:52.051
I don't really breed microbes at all,
but I do have hobbies,

41:52.218 --> 41:55.095
and interests. I mean, so many of those.

41:58.307 --> 42:03.145
There is this thing,
but I think you'll find it stupid.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.897
No, what? What is it?

42:04.980 --> 42:06.982
Well lately, I've been getting into

42:08.609 --> 42:09.860
honey bees.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.196
I don't...

42:12.947 --> 42:13.989
I'm sorry,

42:14.073 --> 42:16.534
did you just say, "Honey bees?"

42:16.617 --> 42:17.535
Yeah.

42:17.618 --> 42:20.120
Yeah, I'm a bit of an amateur beekeeper.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.749
- I know, it sounds silly.
- No, it doesn't sound silly at all, to me.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.919
I'm a bit of an apiarist myself.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.005
- No kidding.
- Yes.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.633
Wow, what a small world.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.343
Tell me, what's your bee of choice?

42:34.426 --> 42:36.053
I used to be all about the Russian bees,

42:36.470 --> 42:40.099
but then I found that their swarminess
tended to be a little too--

42:40.182 --> 42:41.183
Unpredictable.

42:41.267 --> 42:44.562
Unpredictable, that's right.
So, now I'm a Buckfast man all the way.

42:44.645 --> 42:47.398
- They have so much more foraging zeal.
- Yes.

42:47.940 --> 42:53.696
Uh, and, you know, don't get me started
on their resistance to tracheal mites.

42:54.780 --> 42:55.864
Huh.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.658
Tracheal mites.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.912
As soon as you get that application done,
you bring it into me personally, okay?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.414
- Not my secretary.
- I will, sir.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.207
- Sir, call me Delbert, please.
- Okay.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.876
And when you come by,
don't forget to bring a jar of your honey.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.460
As long as you bring a jar of your honey,
we can have ourselves a little honey swap.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.007
Honey swap.[chuckling]

43:13.090 --> 43:14.300
I love it.

43:14.383 --> 43:17.219
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Rattigan, truly.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.887
The pleasure was mine, Delbert.

43:24.518 --> 43:28.314
Thank you so much for setting this up. It
went better than I could have imagined it.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.232
Well, happy to help. Just...

43:30.899 --> 43:32.860
just one little tiny question.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.030
Why exactly are you guys swapping honey?

43:38.157 --> 43:39.366
What, is that unusual?

43:40.576 --> 43:41.576
I can't believe you.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.662
What? I did some research
before my interview, okay?

43:43.746 --> 43:46.957
Hold on a second. What is the difference
between me spouting a few beekeeping facts

43:47.041 --> 43:49.710
and any of the Stand-In dates
that I've been on? Huh?

43:49.793 --> 43:52.463
You know that I'm not an art historian
or a douche, right?

43:52.546 --> 43:55.883
No, actually I don't know that,
and this is completely different.

43:55.966 --> 43:59.386
Those girls paid you to lie to them,
and this time you did it all on your own.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.056
Look, it is hustle, baby, pure hustle.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.807
Oh, God, please don't ever say that again.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.602
It did sound a little bit better
coming out of Reece's mouth.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.647
Wait, Reece? My cousin, Reece?
What does he know about hustle?

44:09.730 --> 44:10.898
It's how he got his BMW.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.984
Brooks, Reece got his car
because his dad started having an affair

44:14.068 --> 44:16.820
with his sister's JV tennis coach,
and his mom found out about it,

44:16.904 --> 44:19.740
so she starts sleeping with the dude
who owns a bunch of BMW dealerships,

44:19.823 --> 44:21.533
hence the BMW.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.620
- What, so no hustle?
- No.

44:24.703 --> 44:25.954
You're telling me

44:26.288 --> 44:29.041
that Reece got a brand new BMW i8,
because

44:29.958 --> 44:31.460
his parents are shitty people?

44:31.543 --> 44:34.672
Yeah. So, maybe you should rethink
who your role models are.

44:37.591 --> 44:40.344
- What about Shelby and Franklin?
- What about Shelby and Franklin?

44:40.427 --> 44:43.847
You don't know the first thing about
vinyl, and I am certainly not from Darien.

44:44.348 --> 44:48.352
Okay? These are the lies that both of us
made up to get what we want.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.732
Hmm.

44:53.816 --> 44:58.612
Storming off, fantastic. That's what
people who're right and not hypocrites do.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.781
Speak more words and I'll hurt you.

[music playing from car radio]

45:07.871 --> 45:09.373
[sighs]

45:12.126 --> 45:14.837
- Maybe you're right.
- About which thing? There were a couple.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.005
Maybe I am a hypocrite, okay?

45:20.342 --> 45:22.761
My parents say that I stomp around

45:23.137 --> 45:24.596
in my boots looking tough...

45:26.140 --> 45:27.349
to push people away,

45:28.016 --> 45:29.017
because

45:30.436 --> 45:34.356
I'm too scared to show people
who I really am.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.904
Oh, God, if anyone actually heard me
saying this.

45:45.325 --> 45:48.120
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

45:48.203 --> 45:49.872
You are Celia Lieberman.

45:49.955 --> 45:53.751
And being weird and confident are not
mutually exclusive elements to life.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.586
You happen to be a master of both of them.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.297
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.593
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.805
So, I can Brooks' house
from across the street,

46:06.889 --> 46:09.349
and sitting beside the outgoing mailbox,

46:09.433 --> 46:11.351
there's this big flimsy cardboard box,

46:11.435 --> 46:16.023
with like 20 postage stamps stuck to it
and just one word written across the top,

46:16.106 --> 46:17.149
Idaho.

46:17.232 --> 46:20.736
So, the mailman picks it up,
and immediately the box gives out,

46:20.819 --> 46:24.239
and little six-year-old Brooks
slips out the bottom,

46:24.323 --> 46:25.866
and hits the pavement like, "Bam!"

46:26.492 --> 46:29.203
I'm hiding across the street
watching it all, like...

46:30.037 --> 46:34.374
- Just laughing my ass off.
- Okay, wait, so what did you do?

46:34.458 --> 46:37.628
I mean the only thing that I could do is
"Good afternoon, Mr. Postman,"

46:37.711 --> 46:40.047
and I grabbed my backpack
and went back inside my house.

46:40.672 --> 46:43.467
I can't believe you tried
to mail yourself to Idaho.

46:43.550 --> 46:45.928
- Thanks, Brooks.
- Thank you so much. I got this.

46:46.011 --> 46:47.429
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.431
- Nice guy.
- Fancy man.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.266
[Celia laughs]

46:51.809 --> 46:54.770
Okay, so of all places, why Idaho?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.439
It's where his mom lives.

46:57.523 --> 47:00.901
Yeah, she's married
to some rich pediatrician

47:00.984 --> 47:04.655
or rich plastic surgeon,
rich pediatric plastic surgeon.

47:05.322 --> 47:07.074
And they have two kids together

47:08.492 --> 47:10.953
and every year they send Brooks
and his dad a Christmas card

47:11.578 --> 47:13.956
with a picture of her whole new family.

47:14.873 --> 47:17.125
You know, which to me,
seems totally screwed up.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.384
[Brooks] See you, Tino!

47:25.509 --> 47:26.509
[Murph] Tino!

47:28.095 --> 47:29.888

47:31.265 --> 47:33.475
- Was that tuna melt on seven grain?
- If only.

47:33.767 --> 47:37.187
- Uh? Tuna melt on seven grain?
- It's nothing.

47:37.271 --> 47:40.816
Murph here has a little crush
on one of the Sub shop regulars.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.943
We don't know his name,
so we call him by his order.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.570
He hasn't been in the shop for a week.

47:44.653 --> 47:47.322
I think I scared him off
by pre-making his sandwich.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.324
Aw, you pre-made his sandwich?

47:49.408 --> 47:51.785
- That is adorable.
- Listen, you're gonna be fine.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.370
He'll show up, and if not,

47:53.620 --> 47:54.788
who cares, right?

47:54.872 --> 47:58.834
You are going to find the right sandwich
one day, my friend.

47:58.917 --> 48:00.627
That is the lamest thing you've ever said.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.755
- Yeah, but you're laughing, aren't you?
- Get away from me, get away.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.341
I'm glad someone's getting
something out of my dating life.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.425
Yeah.

48:08.343 --> 48:12.389
All right, Godspeed
to you on your date tonight.

48:13.515 --> 48:14.715
Are you ready to

48:15.017 --> 48:16.226

48:17.936 --> 48:18.936
I am.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.190
But you seem unenthusiastic.

48:22.691 --> 48:25.444
No, man. I got a request
while we were eating.

48:25.527 --> 48:26.432
Take it.

48:26.445 --> 48:27.613
What? Are you serious?

48:27.696 --> 48:28.696
Really.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.533
All right, thank you.
You're a really good friend.

48:31.617 --> 48:33.118
Hey, good to meet you.

48:33.201 --> 48:34.286
Yeah, you too.

- [Celia] Yeah.

48:55.474 --> 48:56.475
[Celia]You know what?

48:56.558 --> 48:59.728
Does the master have any advice for me,
for my big date?

48:59.811 --> 49:01.313
Yeah, I do actually.

49:01.337 --> 49:03.137
- Good.
- Don't dance.

49:03.523 --> 49:07.527
- That is so offensive. Get out of my car.
- I was just trying to help you.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.655
You know, today was horrible

49:10.447 --> 49:11.531
until it wasn't.

49:12.824 --> 49:13.824
I agree.

49:15.035 --> 49:19.039
Do me a favor, would you have fun tonight?
Seriously, you're gonna dazzle him.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.376
Unless you don't.

49:23.126 --> 49:24.878
Get out of my car.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.214
- I will drive off.
- Okay.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.758
- Right now.
- I'm out. Have a good night.

49:35.722 --> 49:37.099
it's all in the grind.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.268
It has to be precise or the water,

49:40.352 --> 49:43.772
it seeps through the filter too quickly,
and you end up with a weak-ass brew.

49:45.065 --> 49:47.734
Wow, you know a lot about coffee.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.695
Pour Over is an art form.

49:49.778 --> 49:52.197
It's not like that overly processed
swill you've got.

49:53.198 --> 49:56.118
I don't know,
I kind of like my overly processed swill.

49:56.535 --> 49:57.744
I'm sorry.

49:59.454 --> 50:02.082
I didn't mean to insult you.
I ramble when I'm nervous.

50:02.749 --> 50:04.543
Wait, did you just say you're nervous?

50:04.626 --> 50:06.169
- Of course I am.
- Why?

50:06.253 --> 50:10.007
I don't know if this is a date or not,
because you have a boyfriend.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.758
Oh, Brooks is not...

50:12.300 --> 50:15.512
Um, he is my boyfriend,
and we are dating hard.

50:15.595 --> 50:18.724
We're dating hard,
but, you know, we have, um,

one of those advanced modern
relationships.

50:23.979 --> 50:25.564
We don't belong to anyone.

50:25.647 --> 50:28.191
I watched this <i>Nat Geo</i> doc
about dung beetles,

50:28.275 --> 50:32.070
how they find their mates by analyzing the
movements of a prospective mate's wings,

50:32.487 --> 50:36.992
and if they move in the same specific way,
they know they found their mate.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.912
Watching you and Brooks,
you move the same,

50:41.246 --> 50:43.582

- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

So, you're into vinyl,

51:07.105 --> 51:09.816

about coffee.

- Are you familiar with my work?
- Uh-huh.

Okay, you know how I did like
a baby in a gas mask,

51:43.642 --> 51:45.477
and I did like an old man in gas mask.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.560
Oh, yeah.

that is going to blow those away.

Dr. Seuss. I mean, cats don't wear hats.

I was alone, so I got paired with
this group of drunk Germans.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.454
They didn't speak a word of English,

55:18.148 --> 55:20.650
Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm gonna say tonight.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.193
You're writing a breakup script?

55:22.277 --> 55:24.946
Not a breakup script,
more like breakup bullet points.

55:25.864 --> 55:26.964
Oh, wow.

55:27.657 --> 55:29.284
Celia, you look great.

55:29.367 --> 55:30.367
Thanks.

55:31.661 --> 55:32.579
Where's the snake?

55:32.662 --> 55:33.538
Ha.

55:33.955 --> 55:35.540
- What's the plan?
- Right.

55:35.623 --> 55:37.751
Um, so I was thinking

55:38.710 --> 55:39.961
<i>you're gonna go in first.</i>

55:41.504 --> 55:44.090
<i>You walk around, mingle a bit,
do your thing.</i>

55:45.633 --> 55:50.055
<i>Then, at exactly eight o'clock, you
strike up a conversation with Franklin.</i>

55:50.430 --> 55:53.224
<i>It'll play better if it seems
like I'm catching you in the act.</i>

55:53.308 --> 55:56.686
You can put a gas mask on anything
and have a real impact on people,

55:56.770 --> 55:59.356
like Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Rogers,

56:00.106 --> 56:01.106
the Pope.

56:01.649 --> 56:02.525
Huh?

56:02.817 --> 56:03.817
The Pope.

56:04.277 --> 56:07.322
That is brilliant.
I gotta jot that down.

56:07.989 --> 56:11.493
You know that story about the guy
who has to push a boulder up a hill?

56:11.701 --> 56:13.787
Every time it gets to the top
it rolls back down

56:13.870 --> 56:15.705
and he has to start all over again.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.249
That's what talking to you is like.

56:19.376 --> 56:20.376
Thank you.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.504
So, you're saying I'm like Sisyphus?

56:23.213 --> 56:24.547
[Brooks] Oh, my God!

56:25.006 --> 56:27.217
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here with him!

56:27.634 --> 56:28.510
Okay.

56:29.260 --> 56:30.095
[clears throat]

56:30.595 --> 56:33.848
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

56:33.932 --> 56:36.559
- I heard about your little date.
- It was just coffee.

56:36.643 --> 56:40.313
Please, to quote the great
George Costanza, "Coffee is not coffee,"

56:40.397 --> 56:42.524
coffee is sex.

56:42.690 --> 56:44.025
Coffee is better than sex.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.611
Especially from the rare Kopi Luwak bean.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.864
You think you're so much better than me,
Celia?

56:49.948 --> 56:52.148
Better than everyone here,
but I know the truth.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.576
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

56:54.160 --> 56:54.994
A fake.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.415
- Hold on a second.
- So you stomp around in those boots,

56:58.498 --> 57:01.084
and you act so tough,
but that's all it is.

57:01.709 --> 57:04.087
- It's just an act.
- Brooks, please don't do this.

57:04.170 --> 57:06.840
A defense mechanism,
see it's a poor attempt

57:07.215 --> 57:08.591
at pushing people away.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.969
You're afraid that if somebody
got too close to you,

57:11.052 --> 57:13.647
they might actually find out the truth.
That Celia Lieberman,

57:14.931 --> 57:15.931
she's boring.

57:17.517 --> 57:20.520
You wanna push me away?
Go ahead, cos we're through, baby.

57:20.603 --> 57:22.021
We are done, we are--

57:22.647 --> 57:23.731
[crowd gasps]

57:25.275 --> 57:27.068
How's that for a defense mechanism?

57:29.863 --> 57:31.573
God, I hate these shoes.

57:32.949 --> 57:33.783
Celia.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.205
Celia! My dung beetle.

57:59.476 --> 58:00.476
[Shelby] Brooks.

58:03.354 --> 58:06.191
- Hey, are you good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

58:06.357 --> 58:10.361
Uh, physically I'm fine,
but emotionally I'm...

58:10.570 --> 58:11.570
a wreck.

58:11.613 --> 58:14.782
I hate to admit it,
but I kind of saw this one coming.

58:14.866 --> 58:17.368
I mean, those two were being
really chummy at my party.

58:17.869 --> 58:20.205
Yeah, well I can be oblivious sometimes.

58:20.288 --> 58:22.081
Thank you for rubbing that in.

58:43.937 --> 58:47.732
- So, here's a question.
- Yes, whatever it is, yes.

58:47.815 --> 58:49.192
[laughter]

58:49.984 --> 58:51.486
Will you go to formal with me?

58:54.280 --> 58:58.576
I mean, do I have to speak or can you
read my alarming fast heart rate? Yes.

59:04.499 --> 59:07.544
Hold on, you guys have another formal?
How many does your school have?

59:07.627 --> 59:10.046
As many that are needed
to fund the new stables.

59:12.090 --> 59:15.385
Murph, you will never believe what
happened to me. Shelby kissed me.

59:15.468 --> 59:20.014
Oh, dude, congrats.
I always knew you could do it.

59:20.765 --> 59:23.434
- Who's Shelby?
- Toby, why are you here? Where's Murph?

59:23.518 --> 59:25.728
- We switched shifts.
- Why? Is he sick?

59:25.812 --> 59:28.439
I don't think so,
because it wasn't just for today.

59:28.523 --> 59:30.567
It was for like the rest of the year.

59:30.900 --> 59:33.570
- Did he say why?
- No.

59:35.196 --> 59:39.951
Oh, yeah, you know what,
he did say that you were a selfish prick

59:40.034 --> 59:43.037
and that you only think about yourself.

59:44.831 --> 59:48.293
You don't think that has anything
to do with him switching shifts, do you?

59:51.087 --> 59:53.590
[woman] I guess you think
this is pretty pathetic...

59:54.465 --> 59:56.634
going for a walk with some old lady.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.638
No, I feel like I actually needed this.

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:04.934
My granddaughter set this up.
I don't know the first thing about apps,

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.646
unless it's the Bloomin' Onion
at Outback Steakhouse.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.691
- Now that's a good app.
- Mm-hm.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.780
My husband and I did this every day
for the past 20 years.

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:22.118
- He passed away in June.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:23.286
Oliver.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:24.954
That was his name.

01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:28.666
He was ugly as sin.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.252
His face was weird.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:36.966
He had the right sized face
on the wrong sized head.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.303
Ol' smushy face,

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:41.971
that's what I called him.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:43.848
That's real nice.

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.684
I didn't care what he looked like.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.855
He made me laugh,
and I liked being around him.

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:55.652
You want to know how you can tell
if you're meant to be with someone?

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.488
- Please.
- It's simple.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.282
Just sit and have a conversation.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.202
Some people when you talk to them,

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:06.913
it's like trying to listen to
classical music

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.623
on a radio with no antenna.

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:11.626
You can push that dial back and forth
all you want,

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:13.252
but you only get static.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:17.215
But when you're meant to be
with someone,

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.717
and they truly are the one,

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.220
you just sit,

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:23.763
start talking,

01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:27.183
and a Beethoven sonata
will begin to play.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.738
[text message tone]

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.302
You haven't mentioned the formal, Cel.
It's tomorrow night.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:06.013
Do you get a cut of the ticket sales
or something?

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.767
- You are going, right?
- I am actually.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.227
- With whom?
- Nobody.

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:12.854
I'm going whom-less.

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:14.230
What about Brooks?

01:02:14.313 --> 01:02:17.316
I thought you guys were hanging out,

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.235
to use the parlance of your time.

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:21.779
Dad, no. I don't want to go with anybody.

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:25.032
Not Brooks Rattigan, not Franklin Volley,
nobody.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.201
- Okay?
- Honey, listen--

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:28.536
No, Mom, can you listen?

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:32.540
I have the rest of my life to get hung up
on relationships and dating,

01:02:32.623 --> 01:02:35.126
and "Is he really into me?",
and "What does this text mean?"

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:36.711
- And all that bullshit.
- Celia.

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:41.633
Why is high school the time of your life that
you're expected to be good at everything?

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:44.010
I just wanna be whatever I am.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:46.262
And I'm proud of that.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.849
I just wanted you to have a better
high school experience than I had.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.019
Here we go.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.480
- Group hug.
- No, that's good.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:56.731
- Group hug.
- Please.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:03:00.067
- Yep.
- Oh, do we have to? Stop.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.778
[car door creaking]

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.905
Okay.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.334
[doorbell]

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:24.783
Wow.

01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:27.094
You look incredible.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.387
Thanks.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.933
It only took three stylists,
two hairdressers, one makeup artist,

01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:35.186
Bioslimming active wrap,
two hours of pilates,

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:38.064
and like 12 pounds of moisturizer
to look this way.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.191
Wow. I took a shower.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:43.945
Hold on, wait, chivalry is not dead.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.948
- All right.
- Thank you.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:48.573
You're welcome.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:51.494
What's that smell?

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:54.121
[classical music playing]
[Brooks squeaks]

01:04:09.887 --> 01:04:12.390
We ordered our tuna crudo,
like, ten minutes ago.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:15.142
Yeah, it was a while ago.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:23.109
So, Shelby, do you have any plans
for after high school?

01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:25.611
I don't know, it's tough.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.406
I don't, like, have my whole life
planned out or anything.

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:30.658
- Yeah, nobody does.
- Exactly.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.369
So, in the fall,
I'll be going to Columbia,

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.580
where I'll major in applied economics
in management

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:36.998
with a concentration in finance,

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:40.626
and of course, I'll intern at my father's
hedge fund over the summers.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.629
Then, it's off to Harvard Business School,
where I'll get my MBA.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.757
I'll graduate, get some seed money

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.135
and then open up
my own private equity firm, but...

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:52.179
after that,
it's all kind of up in the air.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.016
You really have to get
your shit together, huh?

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.434
Right, yeah.

01:04:58.102 --> 01:04:59.541
Yeah.
How about you?

01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:03.274
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.818
Well, I'm applying to Yale,

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:07.653
and then I'll...

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.536
Well, I've been obsessing over just

01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:19.832
applying for so long, that I haven't even
thought about what I would do if I got in.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.168
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.546
Yeah, but I'm 18.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:30.176
I got time to figure out who I am
and what I want to do.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.845
You know what I mean?

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.139
No.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.226
[dance music playing]

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.023
Here you go. Have a nice night.

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:53.449
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:55.525
It's your ex.

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.746
Is this gonna be weird for you?

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:01.832
I mean, I personally don't care at all,
but maybe you should?

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.125
No, it's fine.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.922
Wow, she's a really bad dancer.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.847
Yeah, she's the worst.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.852
So, you wanna go get a table or...?

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:23.771
- Yeah, sure.
- [woman] Brooks?

01:06:25.022 --> 01:06:25.940
It is you.

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:27.817
Leah, hi. What are you doing here?

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.695
I go here.
Look, I just really wanted to thank you,

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.531
you really helped me out a lot.
If I hadn't used your services,

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:35.783
I wouldn't have been able
to get with Larry, here.

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:38.744
- Hi, I'm Larry.
- It's nice to meet you, Larry.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.579
- Do you want to get that table?
- Uh...

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.624
Wait, what do you mean,
you used his services?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:47.253
- This table right here.
- His Stand-In app, Brooks for hire.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.547
Isn't that what you're doing, Shelby?

01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:54.927
Am I... am I paying somebody
to go out with me?

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:57.221
God, no. Gross.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.390
- Brooks?
- Yeah?

01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:02.059
What the hell is going on here?

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:06.804
I have a side...

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.525
business, where I go on dates with girls.

01:07:11.318 --> 01:07:12.153
Why?

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.823
Wait.

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:19.118

Well, all gigolos are males,
but not all males are gigolos.

No, it's clean and innocent.
I swear, it's...

I'm just some poor kid from Bridgeport,
who wanted to impress you.

01:07:41.348 --> 01:07:43.100
I mean, look at you, you are smart,

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.937
and strong and beautiful,
and you are way too good for me.

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:49.648
You're right.

I have more money than you,

Hey.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:34.443
Where is your date?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.779
She is elsewhere.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.200
I told her everything.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:44.995
Where's Franklin?

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.082
Oh, you know, he's somewhere.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.794
Probably making sure no-one ever wants
to be an artist again.

- You guys didn't work out?
- No.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:09:00.344
No, we didn't.
You know, he's not really my type.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:04.390
Turns out I'm more into oblivious,

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:11.522
Right.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:15.651
Well, then,

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:19.154
would you like to dance?

01:09:27.371 --> 01:09:28.205
No.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:29.872
No, I wouldn't.

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:31.624
Why not?

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.170
Because I'm not your backup.

You're home early.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:54.315
Yeah.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.110
Yeah.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.072
Tonight didn't really go quite
as I thought it would.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:03.323
I'm sorry, kid.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.038
- You wanna lay it on me?
- [switches TV off]

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:18.881
I've been a stand-in.

01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:20.966
I see.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.595
And what do those two words mean
in this context?

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:28.557
Well, I started a dating service app.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.142
- What?
- Yeah.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.226
I was the date,

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.380
the stand-in.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.688
I've raised quite the entrepreneur, huh?

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.982
I mean, it was more just really...

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:40.361
school dances, and um...

01:10:40.694 --> 01:10:43.113

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.907
Oh, yeah, the cowboy outfit.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.992
- You saw that?
- Sure did, pardner.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:51.705
Damn, Brooks, you did all that
just to raise money for Yale?

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:57.169
I'd have sold a non-vital organ,
if I'd known it meant that much to you.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:10:59.713
There's a reason God gave us two kidneys.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:03.175
That spare kidney is just a rainy day
cash cow, sitting there.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.096
It wasn't really just for the money.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.974
I went out on all these dates

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:14.228
and pretended to be whatever it was
that these girls wanted me to be,

01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:16.272
because, I don't know, I thought that...

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:21.485
I thought that maybe I would find out
who I am, and Miss Track...

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.947
quite cruelly pointed out that
I have absolutely no idea who I am.

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.323
Anyway, it didn't work.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.993
Yeah, well who the hell knows
who they are anyway.

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:32.037
We are all just figuring it out
as we go along.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:33.831
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.958
So, the best you can do is

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.711
reflect on who you were in the past

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:41.422
and compare that to
who you wanna be in the future,

01:11:41.922 --> 01:11:44.466
and you split the difference.
That's who you are now.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:47.469
Like, I was a success,

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.014
and I wanna be a success again.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.975
And I was a good husband,

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:55.352
until your mom left us.

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:56.979
She left me,

01:11:57.896 --> 01:12:00.816
but you know what I didn't fail at?
Is being a good dad.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.861
Because of who you turned out to be.

01:12:04.945 --> 01:12:07.781
I know sometimes
you think I gave up and...

01:12:09.533 --> 01:12:11.243
yeah, maybe there's some truth in that.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.289
But I never gave up on you.

01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:18.157
I love you, bud.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.848

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.047
Anyway, let's go get a sub.

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:10.928
- I'll be back.
- Cool.

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.560
Not used to you being alone.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.563
Yeah, well, I've successfully
pushed everyone else away, so...

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:26.693
It occurred to me that
I never would have been able to get

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.029
the Stand-In off the ground,
if it wasn't for you.

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:31.532
And then once
I finally got it to take off,

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:33.992
I shoved you out of the plane,
so I am sorry.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.994
It's not that big a deal, man.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:37.746
Uh...

I have an emotional parachute
that I've been weaving together,

every day I've been alive. [chuckles]

01:13:43.293 --> 01:13:44.628
But how goes that Yale essay?

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.129
It's paused.

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:49.258
I'm not the best judge of my words
or my actions right now.

Or, at the very least, not really bad.

he's taller, he's stronger,
he's obviously better looking than you.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.403
But you are the smart one,
so you have got to make the first move.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.910
So, I guess, let's both do better
at what we have to do.

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:17.953
Huh?

01:14:18.203 --> 01:14:19.037
Yeah.

what happened with you and my cousin,

I'll let you take my car for the weekend.

- No, I'm good.
- Just kidding, I'm not...

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:44.188
- What?
- I said, "I'm good." Thanks though, Reece.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:47.232
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:48.859
It's just a car.

Look, if you ever need
someone to talk to, I'm here.

Okay, I know it can be rough
when your parents go through a divorce.

I hope you didn't waste
too much time on it,

01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:10.542
because based on your meeting
with the Dean,

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.337
you could have drawn a picture of a bee
and gotten in.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.672
I actually didn't apply to Yale.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.134

- Yeah, I accepted UCONN's offer.

Uh...

was everything to you.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:28.184
It was.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:30.687
It was and then I realized

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:33.357
that if I have to pretend
to be someone else to get in,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.942
then I probably don't belong there.
