CHRISTY:
Sorry I'’m late!

00:05.396 --> 00:07.050
Got stuck at work.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.356
Just in time.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.357
Pull up a seat.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.793
Hey, sweetie.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.013
Hey, Mom.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.362
This is dinner?

00:14.449 --> 00:15.406
Pizza and French fries?

00:15.493 --> 00:17.408
What is this, a bowling alley?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.454
He is not allowed any carbs
at your ex-husband'’s house,

00:19.541 --> 00:21.369
so we'’re lobbying
for his affection.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.111
Really? No carbs?

00:24.198 --> 00:26.504
Candace makes us eat sandwiches
wrapped in lettuce.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.550
I'’m sorry,
but that'’s not a sandwich.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.378
Aw, poor guy.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.075
Remind me to slip a dozen bagels

00:32.162 --> 00:34.034
in his overnight bag
before he goes back there.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.687
No pumpernickel.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.908
So what else is going on?

00:38.995 --> 00:40.257
How was your week?

00:40.344 --> 00:41.780
Fine.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.217
Mostly stayed in my room
and played Call of Duty.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.306
I thought Candace

00:45.393 --> 00:47.221
didn'’t let you play
violent video games.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.483
She didn'’t notice.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.962
She was too busy
fighting with Dad.

00:53.618 --> 00:54.576
Really?

00:54.663 --> 00:55.794
What about?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.274
Pretty much everything Dad does.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.626
[no voice]

01:07.023 --> 01:09.286
Did you hear anything specific?

01:09.373 --> 01:11.593
No, I put on my headset

01:11.680 --> 01:13.899
and just focused
on killing Nazi zombies.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.858
And a grateful nation
thanks you.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.992
Roscoe, if your dad
and Candace fighting

01:20.080 --> 01:21.733
is stressing you out,
I need to know.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.474
I'’m okay.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.737
When I need to relax,
I just jump into the Jacuzzi.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.348
It really takes you away.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.093
♪

01:48.891 --> 01:50.240
CHRISTY: Love you, sweetie.
Sweet dreams.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.720
ROSCOE:
Love you, too, Mom.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.031
If I make him pancakes
for breakfast,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.686
he'’ll be mine forever.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.387
Did you get any more dirt
on the unhappy couple?

02:06.474 --> 02:09.824
Only that Baxter spends a lot
of nights in the guest room.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.740
Only? That'’s huge.

02:11.827 --> 02:12.958
I know.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.264
I'’m trying to feel bad about it,

02:14.351 --> 02:16.614
but my face keeps doing this.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.791
Might be time to reconsider
Baxter having shared custody.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.358
Yeah.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.664
If my son'’s gonna be
in a toxic environment,

02:22.751 --> 02:24.579
he might as well live with us.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.669
We may be crazy,
but we can eat toast.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.627
Not tomorrow.
We'’re having pancakes.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.590
I don'’t want to oversell it,
but Car and Driver

02:35.677 --> 02:38.201
called this baby
the Korean Maserati.

02:40.029 --> 02:40.943
Baxter?

02:41.030 --> 02:42.336
Hang on.

02:42.423 --> 02:43.685
Feel free to sit inside.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.948
There'’s 11 cup holders.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.906
See if you can find them all.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.127
Hey, this is a nice surprise.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.694
Lookin'’ for an economy car

02:52.781 --> 02:55.697
that J.D. Power calls
"surprisingly acceptable"?

02:55.784 --> 02:58.830
No, actually, I need to talk
to you about our son.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.180
He okay?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.181
Yeah, fine.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.530
We just need to talk.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.011
Um, okay, my manager'’s watching.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.013
Do you mind if I pretend
you'’re a customer?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.711
If you don'’t mind me pretending

03:09.798 --> 03:11.843
I have enough money
to buy a car, sure.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.367
Step right in, ma'’am.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.935
Good news, you can drive
this beauty off the lot,

03:17.022 --> 03:19.068
no money down,
no payments for a year.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.679
How do we do it?
We'’re crazy, is how!

03:26.989 --> 03:28.556
So, what'’s up?

03:28.643 --> 03:31.733
Well, last night
Roscoe mentioned

03:31.820 --> 03:33.996
that there'’s a lot of tension
in your house.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.433
Ah, damn.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.739
He'’s feeling it, Baxter,

03:37.826 --> 03:39.088
and I'’m a little
worried about him.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.568
I'’m sorry.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.047
I bought him
noise-canceling headphones,

03:42.134 --> 03:44.876
but they don'’t cancel Candace.

03:44.963 --> 03:48.010
Would it be better if he stayed
with me until things calm down?

03:48.097 --> 03:50.578
Probably.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.971
Not that it'’s any
of my business,

03:53.058 --> 03:54.582
but what'’s going on?

03:54.669 --> 03:56.236
I don'’t know.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.020
The closer we get to
the wedding, the more we fight.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.935
It'’s over everything:
the band, the guest list...

04:00.022 --> 04:01.763
you'’re not invited, by the way.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.592
You suggested
inviting your ex-wife?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.811
Yeah, and she threw
a SlimFast at me,

04:06.898 --> 04:10.641
which, even though it'’s only
190 calories, still hurts.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.774
Don'’t tell me, she'’s dieting
to fit into the wedding dress?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.558
Yeah, that'’s not gonna happen.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.300
Unless, you know,

04:17.387 --> 04:19.911
she gets trapped
in a mine for a month.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.133
Baxter, all brides
are stressed out.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.657
You weren'’t.I was trippin'’ on mushrooms.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.920
I thought I was marrying
the Cowardly Lion.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.400
You kind of were.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.836
[chuckles]

04:31.923 --> 04:33.316
Man, I didn'’t know
how good I had it

04:33.403 --> 04:34.491
when I was married to you.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.754
That'’s really sweet, thanks.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.583
And if you ever want
to get out of this wedding,

04:39.670 --> 04:41.106
just say that to Candace.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.458
We did have some good times,
you and me.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.635
Yeah, we really did.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.683
So, are you gonna be all right?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.511
I guess.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.992
I hope you know
I want you to be happy.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.776
It'’s too late to be happy.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.475
The wedding invitations
have already gone out.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.825
[sobbing loudly]

05:05.696 --> 05:08.438
He just can'’t believe
the savings!

05:11.920 --> 05:13.487
Oh, and get this,

05:13.574 --> 05:16.011
Candace made him wax
all the hair off his body

05:16.098 --> 05:19.275
because he sheds
on her expensive sheets.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.624
All the hair?

05:20.711 --> 05:22.757
He must look like
a 200-pound baby.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.150
[laughter]

05:25.237 --> 05:26.761
It just ticks me off,

05:26.848 --> 05:28.589
because she doesn'’t
accept him the way he is.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.373
Isn'’t that our job as women?

05:30.460 --> 05:33.463
To reject a man as he is
and call it love?

05:33.550 --> 05:34.551
[giggles]

05:34.638 --> 05:36.248
Yeah, well, I just

05:36.336 --> 05:38.686
don'’t like seeing him
get pushed around.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.775
Hold on, is this
the same Baxter

05:40.862 --> 05:43.560
I'’ve heard you bitch about
at every single meeting?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.345
Hey, the only person
I bitch about

05:45.432 --> 05:46.737
at every single meeting is her.

05:46.824 --> 05:50.350
You are obsessed with me.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.440
And he'’s not the same Baxter,
he has changed.

05:53.527 --> 05:56.356
Is it just me, or does she have
a lady-stiffy for her ex?

05:56.443 --> 05:57.966
"Lady-stiffy"?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.794
[whispering]

05:59.881 --> 06:01.970
Oh.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.407
Ugh.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.322
But yes, I agree.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.716
Wendy, what do you think?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.979
Schwing!

06:11.066 --> 06:12.546
You'’re all crazy.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.069
I spent years with that guy,

06:14.156 --> 06:16.332
watching him get high
and fail at selling pot

06:16.419 --> 06:19.640
because he was too paranoid
to answer the door.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.250
Yeah, but he'’s
all cleaned up now.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.034
He'’s got a good job,
bright future,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.733
and without hair, probably moves
pretty quick through the water.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.909
[laughter]Christy, all kidding aside,

06:27.996 --> 06:29.606
do you still have
feelings for this man?

06:29.693 --> 06:30.564
Yeah, do you?

06:32.348 --> 06:33.915
Oh, my God!
You have to think about it?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.090
No, I don'’t!

06:35.177 --> 06:36.178
Then what was the pause?

06:36.265 --> 06:37.222
That was a normal,

06:37.309 --> 06:39.007
pre-sentence pause.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.923
Um...

06:42.010 --> 06:44.447
no, it wasn'’t.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.406
[women giggling]

06:46.493 --> 06:47.842
That'’s not fair!

06:47.929 --> 06:50.018
Your pause was way longer
than my pause.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.585
You still haven'’t
answered the question.

06:51.672 --> 06:52.934
I have no feelings for him!

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
Okay, you answered
that weirdly fast.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.546
You did.
Too fast.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.461
Schwing!

07:02.770 --> 07:04.728
Oh, your skin
is so smooth,

07:04.815 --> 07:07.992
it'’s like having sex
with a dolphin.

Did you guys
not hear the timer?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.305
Told you!

07:16.392 --> 07:18.612
Yeah, she still has
feelings for him.

Hey. Not a single hair.

[knocking at door]

Hey.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.768
Oh, hey, you'’re early.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.335
Sorry. Roscoe ready?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.119
No, he'’s on a bike ride
with my mom.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.381
Oh.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.905
Uh... okay if I hang out?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.080
Sure.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.124
You want a cup of coffee?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.170
Thanks.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.172
So caffeine'’s, like, the only
drug you have left, right?

07:57.259 --> 08:00.088
No, I had a cold
on New Year'’s Eve,

08:00.175 --> 08:01.698
and got to huff
a little VapoRub.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.527
Nice.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.835
Man, you and me had
some crazy New Year'’s Eves.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.359
And New Year'’s Days,
checking all the hospitals

08:10.446 --> 08:12.535
and jails trying
to find each other.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.538
You were always in
the last place I looked.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.628
So, what'’s going on
with the honeymoon?

08:18.715 --> 08:19.803
You make any plans?

08:19.890 --> 08:22.023
Two weeks in Italy.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.634
Ooh, that'’ll be fun
with no carbs.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.245
That'’s the least of it.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.770
Candace doesn'’t want us speaking
English while we'’re there

08:29.857 --> 08:32.642
so we don'’t come off like
stupid American tourists.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.514
But you don'’t speak Italian.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.777
[Italian accent]:
And there'’s the problemo.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.519
Thanks.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.910
So, uh, what'’s going
on in your life?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.260
Seeing anybody?

08:42.347 --> 08:43.697
No, not really.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.394
There'’s a guy in
my pre-law class

08:45.481 --> 08:47.222
who always saves a seat for me,

08:47.309 --> 08:48.702
so I guess
we'’ll see where that goes.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.007
Ah.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.443
He'’s 19,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.881
so it might be
more of a mom thing.
