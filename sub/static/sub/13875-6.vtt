00:26.293 --> 00:28.761
Unh, check, check it, yeah

00:28.829 --> 00:30.990

00:31.065 --> 00:34.466
Make the homies say "ho!"
and the girlies want to scream

00:34.535 --> 00:36.469
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:36.537 --> 00:39.995
Make the homies say "ho!"
and the girlies want to scream

00:40.074 --> 00:42.167
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

00:42.243 --> 00:44.177
Number one in the hood, "G."

00:47.414 --> 00:49.006
Frylock:

00:50.251 --> 00:53.243
Another day.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.151
Uh-oh.
Where are my contacts at?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.382
Where are my contacts?

00:56.457 --> 00:57.924
Yo! Meatwad!

00:57.992 --> 00:59.687
You seen my contacts?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.354
Hey! Has anyone seen my con...

01:02.429 --> 01:04.226
Booyah!

01:05.266 --> 01:06.096
Yeah! Seen what, now?

01:06.167 --> 01:08.032
l'm looking for my
contacts, Shake.

01:08.102 --> 01:08.932
Have you seen them?

01:09.003 --> 01:10.971
Seen... what?

01:11.038 --> 01:12.005
Contacts, Shake!

01:12.072 --> 01:13.471
Starring Jodie Foster.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.473
Yeah, l've seen that movie...
twice.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.134
My contacts.
My eyes.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.678
Come on.
McConaughey as a theologian?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.543
Please. That's a stretch.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.048
But when he was in "Texas" lll,

01:23.117 --> 01:25.847
with the hydraulic leg...

01:25.920 --> 01:27.615
that was for reals, y'all.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.246
Whoa!
What the hell was that?!

01:29.323 --> 01:30.312
You smell that?
Smoke?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.325
Drop and roll! Hurry!
Frylock, save yourself!

01:32.393 --> 01:33.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.588
Get out of the house!

01:34.662 --> 01:35.492
Well, which way?

01:35.563 --> 01:36.393
The flames are
tickling your buttocks!

01:36.463 --> 01:38.055
Hurry up, man!

01:38.132 --> 01:39.156
Where's the door,
l got to get out of... aah!

01:39.233 --> 01:41.633
Look at him.
Drunk again, Frylock!

01:41.702 --> 01:44.068
Everyone here got
eye lasers except for me.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.298
What did l do wrong to god?

01:45.372 --> 01:46.361
Eye lasers?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.135
My contact lenses!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.141
Shake, give them back.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.040
What?

01:50.110 --> 01:50.940
What, these?

01:51.011 --> 01:52.979
They were just sitting
there... in your eyes.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.571
These are dinner plates,

01:54.648 --> 01:55.740
Shake, and they still
have food on them!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.875
Well, your eyes
look very hungry.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.044
And those eyes need to eat!

01:59.119 --> 02:00.347
Hey, l got an idea.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.686
Let's take them eye lasers next
door and mouth off to Carl.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.054
Now you're talking.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.524
Pop off at him.
- Gonna pop off the wires.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.026
Shake, wait.
You can't overuse them.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.789
They'll do serious damage to
your eyes.

02:09.864 --> 02:10.728
Wow.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.789
You know what?

02:12.867 --> 02:13.799
Booyah!

02:13.868 --> 02:17.133
l will totally annihilate that
bridge when l come to it.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.695
And l'm not real happy about
your tone right now.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.502
We gonna be popping
off to him.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.600
l've been
working on one all week.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.541
Wait till you hear it.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.046
lt involves... his genitals.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.581
Yo, chubs!

02:33.654 --> 02:35.087
Hey! Hair ball!

02:35.155 --> 02:37.089
Okay.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.624
l'm sorry.
Are you talking to me there?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.660
You spin around and
you direct your attention to me!

02:40.728 --> 02:42.923
Yeah, you had your
cholesterol checked recently?

02:42.997 --> 02:44.931
You probably got a heart
condition coming on.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.591
Oh, yeah.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.531
You serious?

02:47.601 --> 02:48.795
Yes, big boy.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.837
You got a death wish or
something here?

02:50.905 --> 02:53.567
l'm gonna hop in my pool right
now and do a few laps.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.303
And when l get out,
you have better,

02:56.377 --> 02:59.744
if you know what's good for you,
have a warm towel for me,

02:59.813 --> 03:00.939
hot out of the dryer.

03:01.015 --> 03:01.913
And l mean hot!

03:01.982 --> 03:05.110
l will not say it again,
so if l were you,

03:05.185 --> 03:07.483
l'd get those
cottage-cheese thighs moving

03:07.554 --> 03:10.182
to the laundry room and eat a
salad once in a while.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.087
But time is money.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.216
Time is money.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.260
You give us some money.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.693
And my time
right now is devoted to laps.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.821
Man, you told him.

03:16.897 --> 03:17.727
You told him!

03:17.798 --> 03:19.766
Yeah, l know that l did.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.731
lt's just so easy.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.291
l got to tell you, Milkshake,

03:22.369 --> 03:24.394
your mouth is really
writing some checks

03:24.471 --> 03:25.938
that your cup can't cash.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.564
ls that right?

03:27.641 --> 03:32.442
Well, then why don't you deposit
this in your bank of choice?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.003
Bo-o-o-o-m!

03:34.081 --> 03:35.605
No!
- You take it!

03:35.683 --> 03:36.615
The breakfast nook!

03:36.684 --> 03:37.878
Yeah.
- Aah!

03:37.952 --> 03:38.782
lt was a whole Tuscan theme!

03:38.852 --> 03:40.376
Yeah, boy!
You did it! Whoo!

03:40.454 --> 03:43.048
What? You calling me "boy"?

03:43.123 --> 03:43.953
No.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.117
Do l look like
a small child to you?

03:46.193 --> 03:47.182
Of course not.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.660
lt's a term of endearment.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.287
l just... you know, like,

03:50.364 --> 03:52.264
l love you, you love me,
right?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.527
We're a big, happy family?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.464
Please don't hurt me.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.230
Yes, yes.
Sally Forth.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.361
Fetch me my floaty, knave.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.496
Oh, yeah, boy.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.630
l mean... l mean yes, sir.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.696
Yes, sir.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.038
Ugh.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.943
Ugh!
We have talked about this before.

04:06.013 --> 04:09.847
l like it at 7...
this clearly says 6.8.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.248
What's gotten into you, cup?

04:11.318 --> 04:13.377
You put fertilizer on your balls
last night?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.421
Yes.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.456
But that is none of your
concern.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.754
And to clarify, you will speak
when spoken to.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.589
No, l think l speak
when l want.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.788
lt's a free country, Jack.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.922
Oh, you like to
be free, huh?

04:24.999 --> 04:27.661
Well, feel free to feel
your ass burn!

04:27.735 --> 04:29.965
Aah!

04:30.037 --> 04:32.733
So young.
So naive.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.671
You got it?
You got the page?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.039
Not really.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.202
How do you spell "contact"?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.505
With a "C, " Meatwad,
with a "C."

04:38.579 --> 04:39.876
So it is with a "C"?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.040
That's the circle-looking one...
right?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.949
Or the one with the two sticks
crossed?

04:45.019 --> 04:46.350
Two sticks crossed?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.354
That's how l
remember it, but, you know...

04:48.422 --> 04:49.684
don't pin me down.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.691
That's either an "X" or a "K, "
Meatwad,

04:51.759 --> 04:52.783
and neither one of
those are in that word.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.794
l'm gonna sing the song...
l know the song.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.124
No, no, no, Meatwad.
Just focus, focus.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.595
Look, l need you to focus.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.461
Well, one of them is
my favorite of the letters.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.524
You remember when that puppet on
the TV said it?

05:01.602 --> 05:02.933
And then l turned to you.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.971
l said, "that's my favorite letter."

05:05.039 --> 05:06.028
Remember? Remember?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.630
Oh damn, l'm getting sleepy.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.370
Look, just type it in,
Meatwad, okay?

05:10.444 --> 05:11.911
Okay, l'm coming out.

05:11.979 --> 05:12.809
l'm coming out.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.710
Please don't...

05:13.781 --> 05:15.840
l told you not to shoot!
Come on!

05:15.916 --> 05:17.349
ls this a game to you?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.544
lt's not! lt's not!
Please!

05:18.619 --> 05:21.053
'Cause it is to me!

05:21.121 --> 05:21.985
Aah!

05:22.056 --> 05:24.991
Look, l ordered the Mongolian
beef, like you said.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.254
lt was the combination 79.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.157
l got the menu right here.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.160
You circled it!

05:29.229 --> 05:32.494
And l changed
my mind before they got here!

05:32.566 --> 05:34.056
Look, we can reorder.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.069
l was to receive multiple little
corn cobs,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.968
and that is not what l got.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.666
That ain't necessary.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.901
Aah!

05:41.975 --> 05:43.465
Relax, okay?!

05:43.544 --> 05:44.374
W-we can reorder!

05:44.445 --> 05:46.811
Your time is
running out, my friend.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.246
l'll come back with as much
tiny corn as you want.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.544
And all the mini vegetables.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.312
'Cause l know you need your
health!

05:52.386 --> 05:55.150
You keep making mistakes,
and sooner or later,

05:55.222 --> 05:56.587
l'm gonna have to put you down.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.215
Meatwad, you need to hurry.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.021
All right.
There we go. l got it.

06:00.094 --> 06:00.924
You did?!

06:00.994 --> 06:02.723
But this computer...

06:02.796 --> 06:04.093
lt ain't on.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.791
l should have said something to you.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.767
l just didn't want to, you know,
shatter your dreams.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.929
Let's start with the word
"contact."

06:11.004 --> 06:13.131
Aah!
- How is it spelled?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.606
Whoa!
What was that?

06:14.675 --> 06:15.505
That was a mishap.

06:15.576 --> 06:20.275
And that will mis-happen again and
again until l get my mini corn.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.644
Ooh! ls that a computer?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.945
Shake, you know what it is.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.952
And, uh, what is it now?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.453
lt's all right, Frylock.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.683
l got the order in.
Overnight delivery.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.883
You did?
- What order?

06:31.959 --> 06:32.891
l got confirmation
right here.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.393
Excuse me.
Order?

06:34.461 --> 06:35.723
Oh, yeah! My man!

06:35.796 --> 06:36.660
Good job, Meatwad!

06:36.730 --> 06:37.992
What order?!

06:41.368 --> 06:43.461
lt's that special
ice cream l wanted...

06:43.537 --> 06:44.469
from Central America.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.200
Every day is my birthday now,
man.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.332
Yeah. Okay.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.636
That's fine, but where are the
contact lenses?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.200
Oh, man. Yeah.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.973
l don't know what to tell you.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.775
We had to make some sacrifices.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.678
Did you want some?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.478
Feels a little
melted to me.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.143
That's how l saved
on the shipping.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.086
The ice cream...

07:02.156 --> 07:02.986
is bad.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.024
lt displeases me greatly.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.116
You know what?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.182
You have to go to sleep
sometime, Shake.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.786
And when you do, l'll be there
to pluck out those lenses.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.524
Oh, is that right?

07:11.598 --> 07:12.690
Uh-huh.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.199
See? You're losing energy.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.202
Wait.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.601
That is right!

07:17.671 --> 07:18.569
Damn it.

07:18.639 --> 07:22.200
But the viper still stings,
does he not?

07:22.276 --> 07:23.903
Nope.
Not really.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.071
Well...
l got an idea.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.638
Now l'm gonna catch some Z's,
and for your sake,

07:29.716 --> 07:31.206
l hope it doesn't rain.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.582
And, Carl, when l get up,

07:32.653 --> 07:34.086
the sheets had better be
different.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.985
'Cause your Lawrence Taylor
linen set

07:36.056 --> 07:38.388
is not a sexual
turn-on...

07:38.458 --> 07:39.948
when l'm jerking off in your bed.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.392
He was a champion!
- Yeah.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.928
You don't touch those sheets!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.556
All over your
precious water bed!

07:45.632 --> 07:48.692
l'm gonna get you, cup,
if it's the last thing l do!

07:48.769 --> 07:50.896
Yes, l'm sure you will.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.236
And by "sure, "
l mean l highly doubt.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.772
Yeah, l think l'm
gonna take a nap, too.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.175
Frylock:
Wait a minute. Wait!

07:59.246 --> 08:00.440
Meatwad:
Have a good one.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.640
l'll catch you on the flip.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.307
Meatwad, wait!
- Wait on what?

08:03.383 --> 08:05.078
Look, l told you...
l am sleepy, boy.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.244
What do you want from me?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.446
Get the key.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.613
Get the key from Shake.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.621
He's got it on him.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.160
No! The lenses!

08:20.467 --> 08:23.334
Meatwad, is that you?

08:23.403 --> 08:25.098
Thank god! Did you get the key?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.434
l got what l need.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.498
Now l think l'm gonna tell you
what l want.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.510
Yeah!
That looked good!

08:32.578 --> 08:33.841
Carl:
Aw, Meat Man.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.381
You took his friggin'
eyeballs out?

08:36.450 --> 08:37.280
Oh, that's intense.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.011
Yeah, you didn't have to take his
eyeballs, man. Damn.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.018
Yeah, l did.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.179
Okay, fools.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.916
l have re-energized,

08:42.990 --> 08:45.754
and you will be receiving
the dividends

08:45.826 --> 08:48.021
of my constant laser spanking.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.255
Where are you?

08:49.329 --> 08:51.456
l'm only gonna ask that once.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.025
My second question is where
the fuss are my eye...

08:56.103 --> 08:58.628
Forgot l had these
in my pocket.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.865
And they still work!

08:59.940 --> 09:02.306
And now you don't.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.502
Booyah!
And the spare!

09:03.577 --> 09:06.569
You ought to just go ahead
and get the corrective surgery.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.979
l heard it messes
with your night vision.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.040
l've heard good
things about it, though.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.551
Think...
not having to have that saline,

09:12.619 --> 09:14.143
not having to keep up
with glasses...

09:14.221 --> 09:16.212
Listen, the
technology is improved.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.314
lt's hard to say no to.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.154
lt's so expensive, though.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.717
Yeah, but it's gone
down the past couple years.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.956
This one cousin of mine...
you know Terry...

09:24.031 --> 09:25.862
he ain't a medical doctor.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.331
He's self-taught, though.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.460
He passes the savings on to you.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.572
Well, l can see perfectly.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.836
What do you think?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.935
l'm repulsed.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.843
Yet attracted to you.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.007
Gonna show me a little cleave?

09:43.083 --> 09:43.913
l'm good with that.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.973
Yeah, l do good work.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.849
Come on.
Show them how you look at stuff.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.478
l, uh...

09:48.555 --> 09:51.524
l do have to open my bra to...
to see.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.650
But l got no problem with that.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.557
See that?

09:54.628 --> 09:55.856
l do top-notch work.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.124
So, did you,
um...

09:58.198 --> 10:01.361
l'm not interested, but did he
add the lasers for you?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.460
Frylock:
How's that article going?

10:03.537 --> 10:04.936
lnteresting.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.529
Very in-depth.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.767
Very, uh, fascinating.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.869
l'm reading about Marg...
Who am l kidding?!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.436
l can't see it!

10:14.514 --> 10:16.277
Who took my eyes?!

10:16.350 --> 10:18.341
My precious, beautiful eyes!

10:18.418 --> 10:20.249
Hey. Who's the friggin' cup?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.378
ls this Master Shake?

10:21.455 --> 10:22.444
That's me.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.352
What are we knocking out today?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.482
Uh, penis extension...

10:25.559 --> 10:28.323
maximum legally allowable.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.419
We don't do that.
Come on.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.726
What kind of an operation you
think l run here?

10:31.798 --> 10:35.234
This is a legitimate medical...

10:35.302 --> 10:36.564
Uh, van.
This is a van.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.571
Well, then l
guess l'll have to do it myself!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.698
Thanks a lot, asshole!

10:43.276 --> 10:44.766
What's the matter?

10:44.845 --> 10:46.039
Jealous? Huh?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.546
Feel the texture.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.774
Yeah!

10:49.015 --> 10:50.107
Dancing is forbidden

10:50.884 --> 10:52.749
D-d-dancing is forbidden

10:54.121 --> 10:55.520
Dancing is forbidden

10:56.390 --> 10:58.221
D-d-dancing is forbidden

10:59.459 --> 11:00.983
D-d-dancing is forbidden
