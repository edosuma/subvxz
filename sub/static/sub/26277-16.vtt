00:00.024 --> 00:01.234
Previously on <i>Manifest...</i>

00:01.234 --> 00:03.010
Ben just moved out.
The couch is free,

00:03.011 --> 00:04.269
so you can crash here for a bit.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.904
Michaela, I know guys like Zeke.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.339
I can practically smell
the junkie on this guy.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.308
That is such a leap, Jay.
You don't know that.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.177
- You've been busy. This is awesome.
- That petrograph...

00:12.179 --> 00:15.047
It's a drawing of
the constellation Gemini.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.516
From mythology,
like the peacock.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.018
Danny...
You don't need to say anything.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.285
When you're ready...

00:20.287 --> 00:22.287
Next week, next month,
next year...

00:22.289 --> 00:23.956
Just say the word.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.591
I don't think your
drawings cause the future.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.092
I think they predict it.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.527
So, I'm not making things happen.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.362
I just know about them first.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.232
Until we're sure the boy
is our Holy Grail,

00:33.234 --> 00:34.566
we sit tight.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.971
- Alice...
- You're going to save him.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.777
Heads up, everybody.
Here it comes.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.348
- They're gonna die!
- It's a calling.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.582
Griffin's blood work.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.284
He's got the same blood marker.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.685
Just like Zeke.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.754
So, if I'm saying that a bomb's
gonna go off...

00:55.756 --> 00:57.222
if I'm the only one
who knows where...

00:57.224 --> 00:58.524
Do you know where, Griffin?

00:58.526 --> 01:00.559
...then I'm the only one
who can save the day.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.530
Looks like I got myself
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.058

01:39.433 --> 01:40.833
What if we didn't?

01:42.736 --> 01:45.204
Pack it up.

01:45.206 --> 01:49.341
What if we just stayed
forever on this beach?

01:49.343 --> 01:51.176
Cal would not object.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.745
Wait, wait, wait.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.747

Grown woman here, thank you.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.275
You may be all grown up,

02:33.621 --> 02:35.487
No.
No way, buddy.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.189
I can't destroy perfection.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.130
- Hey.
- Thank you so much.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.632
- Thank you. Thank you.

No. I'm...
I'm not hungry.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.707
What about you, honey?
You didn't even serve yourself.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.576
- Can I get you...
- No. Thanks. Just...

03:30.578 --> 03:33.312
Truth is, I've been feeling
sick to my stomach all morning.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.714
We failed Michaela, and now,
a murderer is being released.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.182
- It's...
- Terrifying.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.650
The danger is amping up.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.319
What do you think he's gonna do?

03:40.321 --> 03:43.222
I don't know.

03:43.224 --> 03:47.793
Wolves, peacocks...

03:47.795 --> 03:51.763

has to be in these symbols.

Hey.

Come on, buddy.
We made a deal, right?

04:12.319 --> 04:14.820
You've gotta tell us

04:14.822 --> 04:17.755
I can't.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.423

Larceny. D.U.I.,

05:47.815 --> 05:49.448
possession a few times over,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.350
even an assault.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.984

05:52.986 --> 05:56.888
- I ran his prints.
- How'd you get his prints?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.323
Lifted them off his coffee cup.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.391
Wow.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.692
Come on, Mick.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.727
It's not like you haven't
cut some corners

06:01.729 --> 06:03.395
since you've been back.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.297
Yeah, when it's important,
not as a fishing expedition.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.532
Yeah. Well, I, for one,
I think this is important.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.934
I asked you to back off
of the guy,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.836
and instead, you're breaking
the law yourself

06:10.838 --> 06:12.637
to prove to me
something that I already know.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.905
Has he told you about
all these busts?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.374
- No. Not all...
- I didn't think so.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.675
...but he told me that
he's been in trouble,

06:16.677 --> 06:17.876
that he's struggled with
drugs and alcohol.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.578
No, no, no. Assault.
He hurt someone.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.413
He could hurt you next.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.715
Is that really what you're
worried about? Yeah.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.050
Or are you letting your emotions
get in the way right now?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.718
My emotions got nothing
to do with this.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.328
Do yours?

06:36.330 --> 06:37.662
Is there something going on
between you two?

06:37.664 --> 06:38.864
It is not like that.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.599
Please.
You have to tell me...

06:40.601 --> 06:42.667
Zeke and I are just friends.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.670
Okay?

06:45.672 --> 06:46.805
Okay.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.610
Scarecrow.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.812
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.790
Yo, Diaz.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.961
You want to skip the gym and
make a few extra bucks instead?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.000
I'm not done with you, Griffin!

07:15.002 --> 07:17.002
I feel you, Detective.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.904
The thing is, I'm done with you.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.506
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Enough with the judgy looks.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.741
Did you not get the memo?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.576
I'm a hero.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.578
Real heroes act for
the good of others.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.113
The only reason
that you helped us

07:28.115 --> 07:29.581
was because we let you
out of jail,

07:29.583 --> 07:30.916
let you get away with murder.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.717
That's obviously not what
the callings are for.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.686
I know I'm new, but did your
callings come with a rule book?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.455
'Cause mine didn't.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.089
So, yeah, I think I'm gonna
use them however I want.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.524
You didn't get immunity
for life.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.460
You got lucky... once.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.428
Now every cop in the city's
gonna be waiting

07:43.430 --> 07:44.629
for you to cross that line.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.364
I'm up for the challenge.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.699
Don't think about following me.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.934
That'd be harassment...

07:48.936 --> 07:50.435
And fruitless,
given the fact that

07:50.437 --> 07:53.638
I now, apparently,
have superpowers.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.607
Go figure.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.745
<i>Stop him!</i>

08:03.050 --> 08:04.583
<i>Stop him!</i>

08:04.585 --> 08:05.784
<i>Stop him!</i>

08:07.754 --> 08:08.920
<i>Stop him!</i>

08:18.861 --> 08:21.780
"Stop him" has to be about
Griffin, and we just set him free.

08:21.782 --> 08:23.782
He was taunting me,
Like he was excited to see

08:23.784 --> 08:25.550
what his next calling
was gonna be used for.

08:25.552 --> 08:28.286
The guy who killed two armed
guards and stole $75 million.

08:28.288 --> 08:30.055
His next move could be
off the charts.

08:30.057 --> 08:31.323
Yeah, and there's no appealing
to his better nature...

08:31.325 --> 08:33.024
He does not have one.

08:33.025 --> 08:36.760
He's a classic lack of empathy.
He's sociopathic...

08:36.763 --> 08:38.794
In which case,
how far are we willing to go?

08:38.794 --> 08:39.248
Meaning?

08:39.249 --> 08:41.765
If he doesn't have a moral
compass and is homicidal,

08:41.768 --> 08:45.637
what if the only way to stop him
is to stop him permanently?

08:47.908 --> 08:49.327
There's no way.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.628
The callings have always given us
an opportunity to help people.

08:52.629 --> 08:54.581
But the callings have never
met anyone like Griffin.

08:54.582 --> 08:55.914
I almost got killed
because of the callings,

08:55.916 --> 08:57.649
so forgive me if I don't believe

08:57.651 --> 08:59.415
that they're all
sweetness and light.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.756
- I don't know.
- I think Cal might be able to help.

09:01.757 --> 09:03.755
He...
He knows something.

09:03.757 --> 09:06.024
But he said Zeke's
the only person he could tell.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.726
Really?

09:07.728 --> 09:10.228
I was gonna swing by your place
and look for him.

09:10.230 --> 09:13.231
No. I'll go. I have to ask
about something, anyway.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.066
Um, let's circle back.

09:17.571 --> 09:19.771
Hey.

09:19.773 --> 09:21.072
How are you?

09:21.074 --> 09:23.274
The swelling's gone.
I can barely feel it.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.345
I wasn't asking about your face.

09:27.347 --> 09:28.847
Uh, I'm fine.

09:28.849 --> 09:31.683
Saanvi, it's... it's me.

09:31.685 --> 09:33.385
You don't have to hide
what you're going through.

09:36.123 --> 09:37.956
I'm okay.
Really.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.190
You don't have to
worry about me.

09:39.192 --> 09:40.692
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:03.884 --> 10:07.652
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:07.654 --> 10:10.155
You okay?

10:10.157 --> 10:13.358
Yeah.
Had a calling.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.126
"Stop him"?

10:15.128 --> 10:17.095
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised. You, too?

10:17.097 --> 10:19.898
And Ben.
And Saanvi.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.166
We think it's Griffin.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.136
He's out of jail.

10:25.138 --> 10:26.738
Ben needs to see you.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.840
We should actually
get you a phone.

10:28.842 --> 10:31.743
Ah. Not really anybody
I need to call.

10:31.745 --> 10:34.879
Yeah, but there will be
when you reconnect.

10:34.881 --> 10:37.082
Your mom?

10:37.084 --> 10:40.118
Yeah, she's not interested.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.187
- Did you go see her?
- Did it right this time.

10:42.189 --> 10:45.957
I... I rang the bell,
like you told me.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.760
She wouldn't let me in.

10:48.762 --> 10:50.195
I shouldn't have told you to...

10:50.197 --> 10:52.197
No. It's not on you.

10:52.199 --> 10:53.998
Some families aren't meant
to be together.

10:57.137 --> 10:58.837
We can fix this.
What if we... Don't.

11:01.475 --> 11:03.241
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:05.846 --> 11:09.914
It's just, not everybody
deserves your compassion.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.382
There's things you don't know.

11:11.384 --> 11:13.351
Like the assault charge
on your record?

11:15.355 --> 11:16.855
You ran my sheet?

11:18.258 --> 11:19.858
Jared did.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.493
Of course.

11:23.897 --> 11:25.830
Go ahead, Detective...
Question me.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.966
No. I respect your privacy,
and I don't... No, it's fine.

11:27.968 --> 11:30.168
I'm living in your apartment.
You have the right to know.

11:32.305 --> 11:35.373
I got in a fight.
In a bar.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.841
I didn't like the way
this guy was treating

11:36.843 --> 11:39.511
his supposed girlfriend...

11:39.513 --> 11:41.546
and I was drunk off my ass...

11:41.548 --> 11:43.915
and pow.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.183
Broke his jaw.

11:48.121 --> 11:49.387
The way you're
looking at me right now,

11:49.389 --> 11:51.256
that's why I didn't tell you.

11:51.258 --> 11:52.957
I didn't want things
to change between us.

11:52.959 --> 11:56.194
Hey, nothing has changed
between us.

11:56.196 --> 11:57.762
Everything that happened before,

11:57.764 --> 12:00.331
maybe that's the guy
that you were, but that is...

12:00.333 --> 12:02.300
That is not who you are now.

12:04.971 --> 12:06.237
Okay?

12:32.399 --> 12:34.365
So, you said...
you said Ben was looking for me?

12:37.504 --> 12:38.970
Yeah.

12:43.243 --> 12:45.910
Excuse me.
You're Dr. Saanvi Bahl, right?

12:45.912 --> 12:47.111
Yes.
What can I do for you?

12:47.113 --> 12:48.546
And you're
the treating physician

12:48.548 --> 12:52.116
for a pediatric oncology patient...
Cal Stone?

12:52.118 --> 12:53.351
Yes. Is something wrong with Cal?

12:53.353 --> 12:55.286
I don't know about wrong, exactly.

12:55.288 --> 12:56.454
A little weird, maybe.

12:56.456 --> 12:58.423
I was running some routine labs

12:58.425 --> 13:01.893
on the guy who was in the river...
James Griffin.

13:01.895 --> 13:04.162
A blood marker I've never seen
before popped up,

13:04.164 --> 13:07.232
so I ran it through the archives.

13:07.234 --> 13:10.835
Turns out, your cancer patient has it, too.

13:10.837 --> 13:12.370
Really?

13:12.372 --> 13:14.439
No other
hits in the whole database.

13:14.441 --> 13:17.208
I'm thinking we should run it
by the department heads.

13:17.210 --> 13:20.044
Maybe we have some sort
of a discovery.

13:20.046 --> 13:22.213
We can write an article.

13:22.215 --> 13:25.049
Or you can, and I could,
you know, help.

13:25.051 --> 13:27.151
Uh, I'm sorry.
And you are...?

13:27.153 --> 13:29.520
Oh, my bad.
Uh, Troy Davis.

13:29.522 --> 13:31.155
Oncology lab tech.

13:31.157 --> 13:33.558
Okay. Troy, why don't you
send me those labs?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.193
I'll go over them
before we go any wider.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.527
It might be a false positive.

13:36.529 --> 13:40.331
I thought so, too,
so I ran it twice.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.300
I think it's legit.
- Just send me the labs.

13:42.302 --> 13:44.335
Thank you.

13:44.337 --> 13:45.903
Will do.

13:55.181 --> 13:57.849
Deep breaths.

13:59.986 --> 14:01.185
Good. Keep it up.

14:04.491 --> 14:05.623
We have to stop meeting like this.

14:09.996 --> 14:11.596
Mnh.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.666
My therapist.

14:14.668 --> 14:17.568
Started seeing her a few years
back for anxiety...

14:17.570 --> 14:20.905
Which is why I could see yours
from a mile away.

14:20.907 --> 14:22.173
She's really helped me
get it under control.

14:22.175 --> 14:23.574
No.

14:23.576 --> 14:26.411
No. People already
have concerns about me,

14:26.413 --> 14:29.013
with the plane
and everything else,

14:29.015 --> 14:31.149
and I've worked really hard
to prove that I'm stable.

14:31.151 --> 14:33.484
No, I-I'm not saying you're not.

14:33.486 --> 14:38.089
But you've been through
a traumatic ordeal.

14:38.091 --> 14:42.126
She's very good,
and very discreet.

14:42.128 --> 14:44.729
Just... think about it.

14:51.504 --> 14:53.604
Physician, heal thyself.

15:09.556 --> 15:11.356
Hey, man.
Can I come in?

15:13.226 --> 15:14.525
Heard you wanted to see me?

15:17.697 --> 15:19.197
You got a drawing to show me?

15:23.303 --> 15:24.569
Come on.

15:24.571 --> 15:26.671
Remember what we talked about?

15:26.673 --> 15:30.007
You don't cause the future, Cal.
You just see it.

15:30.009 --> 15:31.376
I know.

15:31.378 --> 15:34.746
But what I see...

15:34.748 --> 15:37.048
How do I stop it
from coming true?

15:38.718 --> 15:40.985
I don't know.

15:40.987 --> 15:44.555
But I can't help you until I see
what we're dealing with.

15:47.127 --> 15:48.493
That's why I'm here.

15:48.495 --> 15:50.428
You saved me.

15:50.430 --> 15:51.696
I owe you one.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.033
We're supposed to
keep each other safe.

16:00.707 --> 16:02.740
Promise you won't tell my dad?

16:02.742 --> 16:04.976
Or Auntie Mick?

16:04.978 --> 16:06.411
I don't know, man.

16:06.413 --> 16:08.112
They can't know.

16:08.114 --> 16:09.380
You have to promise.

16:11.718 --> 16:13.518
All right.
I promise.

16:32.572 --> 16:35.239
How can I tell my dad
we're all gonna die?

16:45.490 --> 16:48.225
- How's Cal?
- He's tired.

16:48.227 --> 16:50.694
- Says he's gonna rest for a bit.
- What did he say?

16:52.531 --> 16:54.631
He's... He's worried something's
gonna happen to you...

16:54.633 --> 16:56.399
To all of you.

16:56.401 --> 16:59.015
Must be about Griffin,
to what we heard... "Stop him."

16:59.016 --> 17:00.137
Stop him from doing what?

17:00.139 --> 17:03.240
I don't know.
Neither does Cal.

17:03.242 --> 17:05.242
I think I do.

17:05.243 --> 17:08.211
<i>James Griffin, the mystery man
who was underwater</i>

17:08.213 --> 17:09.512
<i>for 3 1/2 days,</i>

17:09.515 --> 17:12.082
<i>then back good as new.</i>

17:12.084 --> 17:13.550
<i>He'll be joining us
in the 11:00 hour</i>

17:13.551 --> 17:15.285
<i>to answer our questions,</i>

17:15.287 --> 17:18.121
<i>starting with
why the NYPD has released</i>

17:18.123 --> 17:19.455
<i>the accused killer.</i>

17:19.458 --> 17:22.125
<i>Some sensational details
about his return</i>

17:22.127 --> 17:24.594
<i>and his amazing abilities.</i>

17:24.596 --> 17:26.229
"Amazing abilities"?

17:26.231 --> 17:27.696
He's gonna reveal the callings.

17:27.699 --> 17:30.233
- Why would he do that?
- Fame, fortune.

17:30.235 --> 17:31.735
Once he breaks the news
on national television,

17:31.737 --> 17:33.503
he's bound to make millions.

17:33.505 --> 17:34.771
The Internet's
already blowing up

17:34.773 --> 17:37.340
about his return being
the next 828.

17:37.342 --> 17:38.708
If he tells the world
about his callings,

17:38.710 --> 17:40.277
people will assume
we have them, too.

17:40.279 --> 17:41.545
Yeah. And they'll come for us.

17:41.547 --> 17:43.380
God, Cal...

17:43.382 --> 17:45.215
He'll never be able to lead
a normal life.

17:45.217 --> 17:46.550
We're screwed either way.

17:46.552 --> 17:48.485
The Believers now have proof
of the miracles,

17:48.487 --> 17:51.454
and the Xers have proof
that we're dangerous, so...

17:51.456 --> 17:52.756
Not to mention the government.

17:55.227 --> 17:56.459
We're not gonna let this happen.

17:56.461 --> 17:57.794
So, what's the plan?

17:57.796 --> 18:00.163
We know where he's gonna be.

18:00.165 --> 18:01.531
We go to the TV studio,

18:01.533 --> 18:03.099
find Griffin
before he goes on camera.

18:03.101 --> 18:04.568
- And what?
- And we stop him.

18:04.570 --> 18:05.769
How are you gonna do that?

18:05.771 --> 18:07.270
We have to convince him somehow.

18:07.272 --> 18:09.306
You already talked to him
for hours...

18:09.308 --> 18:11.208
Then, we try again.
...and Griffin still got what he wanted.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.176
I know guys like that.
They don't listen to words.

18:13.178 --> 18:16.479
They only understand
brute force.

18:16.481 --> 18:18.849
It's hard to believe
theveryone's lives ruined? Ntss

18:18.851 --> 18:20.817
- Yours? Cal's?
- No, I agree with Ben.

18:20.819 --> 18:22.452
- We can't cross that line.
- Then what?

18:22.454 --> 18:23.653
What... What if
he doesn't listen?

18:23.655 --> 18:25.121
I don't know.

18:30.495 --> 18:32.329
- What?
- Where are you going?

18:32.331 --> 18:35.332
- I've just got to go.
- Zeke, wait.

18:35.334 --> 18:36.333
What's up with him?

19:46.638 --> 19:51.441
I feel like I'm supposed to
be helping solve this.

19:51.443 --> 19:54.678
But I... I can't figure it out.

19:57.015 --> 19:59.716
It's not your responsibility
to find all the answers.

20:02.421 --> 20:04.354
Yeah, I know.

20:04.356 --> 20:07.824
But ever since Dad came back...

20:07.826 --> 20:11.361
we haven't had something
that's ours...

20:11.363 --> 20:13.530
Until this.

20:13.532 --> 20:14.931
And for the first time,

20:14.933 --> 20:18.969
I feel like we're finally
connected again.

20:18.971 --> 20:21.004
Yeah.

20:21.006 --> 20:22.939
It's been hard for me, too.

20:22.941 --> 20:24.941
We weren't on the plane.

20:24.943 --> 20:27.377
We're not having the callings.

20:27.379 --> 20:28.678
Yeah, you get it.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.946
I do.

20:29.948 --> 20:31.748
I feel the same way.

20:31.750 --> 20:35.919
They're off saving the world,
and all I can do is...

20:35.921 --> 20:39.089
glue a wooden dragon back together.

20:39.091 --> 20:41.925
Which you are crushing,
by the way.

21:27.639 --> 21:30.006
Excuse me. NYPD.

21:30.008 --> 21:31.908
Griffin!

21:31.910 --> 21:33.510
Come to join me?

21:33.512 --> 21:35.111
Adding a few 828 passengers

21:35.113 --> 21:36.813
would certainly
pump up the crowd.

21:36.815 --> 21:39.749
- Hard pass.
- Suit yourself.

21:39.751 --> 21:42.585
Yeah, it seems like that's all
you know how to do, Griffin.

21:42.587 --> 21:44.421
We know more than you.

21:44.423 --> 21:47.557
We've seen what happens when the
callings are abused or ignored.

21:47.559 --> 21:50.026
Am I gonna catch
a case of bad karma?

21:50.028 --> 21:52.028
You know, for a guy who
only thinks about himself,

21:52.030 --> 21:53.463
you are doing a lousy job

21:53.465 --> 21:54.831
of looking out
for your own interests.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.500
You're a free man, Griffin.
Take the win.

21:57.502 --> 21:59.836
Don't reveal the callings
and ruin all of our lives.

21:59.838 --> 22:01.471
Not my life.

22:01.473 --> 22:03.473
I'm about to become
a rich man...

22:03.475 --> 22:04.707
No armored car required.

22:04.709 --> 22:06.676
Oh, you're gonna
need protection.

22:06.678 --> 22:08.078
- From you?
- No.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.913
From people more ruthless
than you can imagine.

22:09.915 --> 22:11.514
The government
will stop at nothing

22:11.516 --> 22:14.417
to find out about the callings.

22:14.419 --> 22:16.419
Well, I guess it's
the government's lucky day.

22:20.592 --> 22:22.492
<i>Stop him!</i>

22:22.494 --> 22:23.693
<i>Stop him!</i>

22:23.695 --> 22:24.928
<i>Stop him!</i>

22:24.930 --> 22:26.196
Griffin!

22:41.746 --> 22:43.079
- Oh!
- Oh!

22:45.217 --> 22:46.616
- Oh!
- Oh!

22:46.618 --> 22:50.120
- Oh, my God!
- No!

23:04.836 --> 23:07.804
- Oh, my God!
- James Griffin!

23:15.786 --> 23:17.215
The Medical Examiner said

23:17.216 --> 23:20.789
Griffin had all the signs of drowning,
but can't be sure without an autopsy.

23:20.791 --> 23:23.625
- It doesn't make sense.
- Any ideas?

23:23.627 --> 23:24.707
None of my own.

23:24.708 --> 23:26.828
But Saanvi has that friend that
works at the M.E.'s office.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.797
Maybe she can get
some inside information.

23:28.799 --> 23:30.732
That sounds like a plan.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.603
Hey, one sec.

23:39.510 --> 23:40.775
Zeke!

23:40.777 --> 23:42.344
Hey, Zeke!

23:43.747 --> 23:45.647
What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.384
The calling said,
"Stop him."

23:49.386 --> 23:52.154
I knew there was nothing
you could say to convince him.

23:52.156 --> 23:54.089
And I thought... I-I thought,

23:54.091 --> 23:56.458
if it came right down to it,
then I could...

23:56.460 --> 23:58.593
- I thought I was supposed to...
- You're supposed to what?

24:00.597 --> 24:02.564
Never mind.
Doesn't matter.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.667
I mean, I-I didn't see
everything, but I saw enough.

24:05.669 --> 24:08.270
All that water... what...
I mean, what the hell was that?

24:08.272 --> 24:09.538
I don't know.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.144
Zeke, I... I can tell you're
really upset right now.

24:16.146 --> 24:17.779
I'm okay... I think.

24:17.781 --> 24:20.682
I mean, I... I think I just
didn't sleep well last night.

24:20.684 --> 24:22.684
I just think I just need
to get some rest.

24:22.686 --> 24:24.386
Hey, why don't you go back
to the apartment?

24:24.388 --> 24:25.754
You know, shower, nap.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.622
Just chill.

24:27.624 --> 24:29.424
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.659
Thanks.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.736
James Griffin just out-spewed
the girl in "The Exorcist."

24:43.473 --> 24:44.873
And?

24:44.875 --> 24:46.875
T-That doesn't seem
peculiar to you?

24:46.877 --> 24:48.543
The man is dead.

24:48.545 --> 24:50.612
When you've been doing this
as long as I have,

24:50.614 --> 24:53.682
peculiar is just a signal
that we have got work to do.

24:53.684 --> 24:54.883
So, what's our play?

24:54.885 --> 24:56.618
The same as it was
an hour ago...

24:56.620 --> 25:00.555
Find out everything we can about
Cal Stone and his abilities.

25:00.557 --> 25:03.425
You finally ready to approach him?

25:03.427 --> 25:06.394
I'm still collecting data.
Shouldn't be long now.

25:06.396 --> 25:09.264
I'm close to having
all the answers I need.

25:15.539 --> 25:18.306
I saw you with Zeke just now.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.507
Yeah.
What was he doing there?

25:19.509 --> 25:20.742
Why are you
so obsessed with him?

25:20.744 --> 25:22.444
I'm not obsessed with Zeke.

25:22.446 --> 25:24.412
I'm worried about you.
You're not seeing straight.

25:24.414 --> 25:26.548
If you're gonna lecture me
on Zeke's past again, I...

25:28.418 --> 25:29.851
It's not his past.

25:29.853 --> 25:32.420
Right now. Today.

25:32.422 --> 25:34.422
Yeah, he's using again.

25:34.424 --> 25:36.291
You followed him?

25:36.293 --> 25:37.792
That's not the point, Mick.
This guy's just like Griffin...

25:37.794 --> 25:39.861
No, he's not!

25:39.863 --> 25:42.530
I keep telling you, Jared,
he's like me, okay?

25:42.532 --> 25:44.399
He needs my help.
And if you wanted to help me,

25:44.401 --> 25:46.234
you'd be helping him, too.

25:46.236 --> 25:47.502
I couldn't care less
about this guy.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.007
All I care about is you.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.443
Look, Mick, I know we're not
in a good place right now,

25:55.445 --> 25:57.612
but I haven't given up on us.

25:57.614 --> 26:00.915
Jared, I haven't given up
on us, either.

26:00.917 --> 26:02.851
But this isn't about us.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.286
Are you sure?

26:04.288 --> 26:05.487
I promise.

26:05.489 --> 26:07.756
I need to be there
for him, okay?

26:07.758 --> 26:09.691
Zeke needs me. I have to
listen to the callings.

26:09.693 --> 26:13.428
The callings...
That's what's blinding you.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.963
This guy's a junkie.

26:14.965 --> 26:17.232
He's not gonna quit using
unless someone stops him.

26:17.234 --> 26:18.933
If you won't, I will.

26:28.278 --> 26:30.712
Hey, Saanvi. I got your text.
What's the emergency?

26:30.714 --> 26:32.747
I need James Griffin's
autopsy report.

26:33.984 --> 26:35.850
You know I can't give you a copy.

26:35.852 --> 26:38.253
A case this high-profile,
we can't afford leaks.

26:38.255 --> 26:40.055
Alex, c'mon.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.527
I carried you through Cell Biology.

26:45.529 --> 26:47.462
That was med school.

26:47.464 --> 26:48.697
Yeah, and failing that class

26:48.699 --> 26:49.764
would've been
the end of med school.

26:49.766 --> 26:51.032
Instead, you got an A.

26:52.869 --> 26:55.570
You owe me.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.382
Can I help you?

27:07.384 --> 27:08.616
Priscilla Landon?

27:08.618 --> 27:12.420
- Yes.
- Um, Detective Stone, NYPD.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.089
I'm here about your son, Zeke.

27:15.892 --> 27:17.659
Uh, whatever he's done,
I can't...

27:17.661 --> 27:19.894
I-I'm sorry, but I just... I can't.

27:19.896 --> 27:22.030
No, he hasn't done anything.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.432
I know he came to see you
yesterday.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.635
- Mm-hmm.
- Why'd you turn him away?

27:27.637 --> 27:28.970
I'm also a friend.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.409
I love my son,

27:34.411 --> 27:37.946
and I will never stop loving him.

27:37.948 --> 27:41.850
But for an entire year, he can't
be bothered to show his face.

27:41.852 --> 27:44.719
And then, he shows up, on drugs,

27:44.721 --> 27:48.923
with excuses and lies, and...

27:48.925 --> 27:50.358
nothing's changed.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.927
I think it's different now.

27:52.929 --> 27:55.029
He went through something...

27:55.031 --> 27:56.364
life-changing.

27:56.366 --> 27:58.633
Yes, yes. I-I heard it.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.402
Um.

28:00.404 --> 28:05.373
About being in a cave,
dying, coming back to life.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.609
A clean slate...

28:07.611 --> 28:09.878
He's an addict.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.647
And addicts will tell you
whatever you want to hear.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.917
I know that it sounds crazy,
but it is true.

28:15.919 --> 28:20.422
I know because it happened
to me, too.

28:20.424 --> 28:24.459
I came back,
and my mom was gone.

28:26.363 --> 28:29.397
Wait.
I-I-I recognize you.

28:29.399 --> 28:31.900
You... You were on, uh,
that flight, uh...

28:31.902 --> 28:33.134
Flight 828.

28:33.136 --> 28:35.570
Like I said, it sounds crazy...

28:35.572 --> 28:37.739
But... But Zeke, he...
He wasn't on the plane...

28:37.741 --> 28:39.674
It's not just about
the airplane...

28:39.676 --> 28:41.075
Not... not anymore.

28:47.384 --> 28:50.518
I sent him away.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.021
I said horrible things to him.

28:54.724 --> 28:57.559
He'll come back.

28:57.561 --> 29:01.062
When he does,
this time, let him in.

29:04.801 --> 29:06.434
You know, I thought coming back

29:06.436 --> 29:11.606
and finding Mom gone
was the worst.

29:11.608 --> 29:15.510
But I... can't imagine coming home

29:15.512 --> 29:20.048
and having the door
slammed in your face.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.916
But, I mean, it's gonna be okay.

29:21.918 --> 29:23.651
I'm fixing it...
Or at least starting to.

29:23.653 --> 29:25.887
Hey. You've got enough
on your plate.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.423
You don't have to
fix things for Zeke.

29:28.425 --> 29:29.624
No, I think I'm supposed to.

29:29.626 --> 29:32.126
I...

29:32.128 --> 29:34.929
On the beach, in Jamaica,
Mom told me,

29:34.931 --> 29:36.998
"You're never too old
to need your mother."

29:37.000 --> 29:39.701
Of course she did.

29:39.703 --> 29:41.636
I can still feel her.

29:41.638 --> 29:43.004
- Mom?
- Yeah.

29:43.006 --> 29:44.639
It's like she's still here,

29:44.641 --> 29:47.208
like she's been watching over me
ever since I got back,

29:47.210 --> 29:49.911
helping me figure this out.

29:51.648 --> 29:53.548
I like that theory.

29:57.487 --> 30:01.155
James Griffin's death,
it's a game-changer.

30:01.157 --> 30:06.027
The autopsy shows unequivocal
evidence of death by drowning.

30:06.029 --> 30:07.929
He drowned on dry land?

30:07.931 --> 30:09.931
Which is, of course, impossible.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.699
What about secondary drowning?

30:11.701 --> 30:13.768
I mean, I've heard stories about
kids being pulled out of pools

30:13.770 --> 30:16.137
- and dying hours later.
- Well, this was days later.

30:16.139 --> 30:20.074
And the video... he appears to
expel more water than body mass.

30:20.076 --> 30:22.644
I don't think science can explain this

30:22.646 --> 30:24.546
any more than it can explain us.

30:24.548 --> 30:26.147
Yeah, well, I've got
an explanation for it...

30:26.149 --> 30:29.684
He abused the callings,
and that's what got him killed.

30:29.686 --> 30:32.720
Wait till the Believers
find out about this.

30:32.722 --> 30:34.989
Yeah, you're right, but...

30:34.991 --> 30:38.860
they're not our only problem.

30:38.862 --> 30:41.095
The blood marker's
been discovered.

30:41.097 --> 30:43.031
In Griffin's blood?

30:43.033 --> 30:44.232
And in Cal's.

30:47.103 --> 30:49.804
Look, there was always a risk
that someone was gonna notice

30:49.806 --> 30:51.706
the anomaly in Cal's labs,
but until Griffin,

30:51.708 --> 30:53.141
no one had a reason to look.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.645
I will do what I can
to bury the findings,

30:57.647 --> 31:00.048
but if I can't, it's not
gonna be much longer, Ben,

31:00.050 --> 31:01.683
before the larger medical community

31:01.685 --> 31:03.051
catches wind of it,
and then they will...

31:03.053 --> 31:06.120
And they'll want to
examine Cal more closely.

31:10.026 --> 31:11.326
Yeah.

31:15.632 --> 31:16.931
Okay.

31:16.933 --> 31:18.866
I'm sorry to dump and run,

31:18.868 --> 31:22.236
but I have an appointment...
with a therapist.

31:24.307 --> 31:26.240
If you're worried about
what I'm gonna say...

31:26.242 --> 31:28.009
No, no, no, of course not.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.279
Nothing's more important than
you getting the help you need.

31:31.281 --> 31:33.781
I'll call you later.

31:35.785 --> 31:37.151
Even after his death,

31:37.153 --> 31:38.920
that son of a bitch
is still a threat to us.

31:38.922 --> 31:41.122
I can't let Cal
become a guinea pig.

31:43.226 --> 31:44.692
<i>Stop him.</i>

31:49.199 --> 31:50.465
Did you not hear that?

31:52.335 --> 31:54.569
No.

31:54.571 --> 31:56.037
The calling again?
"Stop him"?

31:56.039 --> 31:58.706
I don't get it. Why did I
just hear it, and you didn't?

31:58.708 --> 32:00.108
I don't know.
Maybe...

32:00.110 --> 32:03.711
we all were supposed to
stop Griffin, and...

32:03.713 --> 32:05.146
you still have
something left to do.

32:09.319 --> 32:11.152
Zeke.

32:11.154 --> 32:12.987
Jared said that he made a buy.

32:12.989 --> 32:14.756
Ben, what if Zeke
is using again?

32:14.758 --> 32:16.824
What if he's the one
that I'm supposed to stop?

32:16.826 --> 32:18.026
Go. Go.

33:07.249 --> 33:09.583
Mom!
Dad's home!

33:23.699 --> 33:26.366
- Ben...
- J-Just give me one second.

33:32.641 --> 33:35.175
Dad... what is it?

33:35.177 --> 33:37.478
You're... kind of
freaking me out.

33:39.548 --> 33:40.848
No secrets, remember?

33:45.855 --> 33:48.422
According to the police report,

33:48.424 --> 33:52.493
Griffin was underwater
for 82 hours and 8 minutes.

33:52.495 --> 33:53.594
8-2-8.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.529
That's... That's really weird.

33:55.531 --> 33:58.365
Hold on. According to
the Medical Examiner's report,

33:58.367 --> 34:03.137
his death was exactly
82 hours and 8 minutes later.

34:03.139 --> 34:06.406
So, the exact amount of time
he was gone is the same...

34:09.779 --> 34:12.346
...the same exact amount of time...

34:14.150 --> 34:15.549
...he was alive again.

34:18.554 --> 34:20.754
No, that has to be
a coincidence.

34:20.755 --> 34:24.525
- Right?
- Just...

34:24.527 --> 34:28.762
Are you saying
Griffin had some kind of...

34:28.764 --> 34:30.364
expiration date?

34:32.301 --> 34:34.735
What does that mean?

34:34.737 --> 34:37.304
Does that mean that you
could have one, too?

34:37.306 --> 34:38.839
No. No.

34:38.841 --> 34:41.141
No. Griffin was evil.

34:41.143 --> 34:43.277
He was a criminal.

34:43.279 --> 34:45.279
Tell her, Ben.

34:45.281 --> 34:46.547
Dad...

34:46.549 --> 34:48.415
Okay. We were gone for 2,037 days...

34:48.417 --> 34:50.384
Add that to our date of return...

35:04.433 --> 35:06.867
June 2, 2024.

35:06.869 --> 35:08.402
How did you get that so fast?

35:08.404 --> 35:12.573
It's been right in front of us all along.

35:12.575 --> 35:15.742
The peacock goddess Juno...
June.

35:17.913 --> 35:20.881
The petrograph of
the constellation Gemini, twins,

35:20.883 --> 35:22.683
represents the number 2.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.619
June... June 2nd.

35:27.456 --> 35:30.157
H-Honey, those could be representative

35:30.159 --> 35:31.658
of any number of... No, no, no.
I'm not done.

35:35.898 --> 35:37.531
Cal's dragon?

35:37.533 --> 35:42.302
Like you said, a wooden dragon.

35:42.304 --> 35:44.705
It's a craft project.
Art the Dragon...

35:44.707 --> 35:48.942
The year of the wood dragon
in the Chinese zodiac?

35:48.944 --> 35:51.445
2024.

35:51.447 --> 35:55.182
I got the exact same date.

35:55.184 --> 35:58.285
June 2, 2024.

36:01.523 --> 36:03.624
She's right.

36:03.626 --> 36:05.759
No.

36:05.761 --> 36:07.361
No.

36:07.363 --> 36:09.529
I just... I just got you back.

36:09.531 --> 36:11.832
I ca... I can't lose you.

36:11.834 --> 36:13.634
I can't lose you.

36:16.572 --> 36:19.539
We can't tell Cal.

36:19.541 --> 36:22.509
He's spent five years...

36:22.511 --> 36:25.345
waiting to die.

36:25.347 --> 36:27.514
Please, just promise me
you're not gonna tell him.

36:27.516 --> 36:31.251
He can't go through this again.
It's not fair.

36:31.253 --> 36:32.619
It's okay, Ollie.

36:33.923 --> 36:35.389
I know.

36:37.893 --> 36:41.461
I just... didn't know how to tell you.

37:06.989 --> 37:09.289
Hi, Doctor.

37:09.291 --> 37:10.757
Please, come in.

37:10.759 --> 37:13.393
Okay.

37:13.395 --> 37:16.496
Have a seat.

37:19.868 --> 37:23.437
Come on, Zeke, pick up.

37:31.313 --> 37:32.846
- What the hell?
- Where is it?

37:32.848 --> 37:36.783
- Where's what?
- The drugs.

37:36.785 --> 37:38.518
What are you talking about?
I'm clean.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.787
Yeah, sure you are.

37:44.693 --> 37:47.661
Maybe we should just...

37:47.663 --> 37:49.096
go.

37:50.632 --> 37:53.367
Go where?

37:53.369 --> 37:56.903
Back to that beach.

37:56.905 --> 37:59.973
Jamaica?

37:59.975 --> 38:02.275
Just...

38:02.277 --> 38:03.543
be together.

38:05.647 --> 38:06.980
The four of us.

38:12.888 --> 38:14.888
There's something
I have to tell you.

38:17.526 --> 38:18.759
What is it?

38:34.610 --> 38:36.109
Hey.

38:36.111 --> 38:38.779
Come on. It's not like this day
could get any worse.

38:41.116 --> 38:44.084
I'm pregnant.

38:55.898 --> 38:59.733
That is amazing...

38:59.735 --> 39:01.902
beyond amazing.

39:03.605 --> 39:05.906
So, it'll be the five of us,
a new beginning.

39:10.612 --> 39:13.080
How far along are you?

39:13.082 --> 39:15.015
Not very.

39:15.017 --> 39:16.850
Six weeks, maybe.

39:17.920 --> 39:24.391
So, right when the plane came...
back...

39:28.030 --> 39:30.097
Or just before.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.602
It could have been.

39:57.793 --> 39:59.626
- Clean and sober, huh?
- I didn't touch it.

39:59.628 --> 40:01.528
Not one drop of that is gone.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.463
Yeah, no, you went straight
for the hard stuff.

40:03.465 --> 40:04.831
I know you made a buy.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.800
Where is it?
Or did you use already?

40:06.802 --> 40:08.201
You want to blood test me?
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

40:08.203 --> 40:10.670
That's the last thing
I want to be doing!

40:10.672 --> 40:12.839
I have a job, busted marriage,

40:12.841 --> 40:14.841
and dealing with your crap
is destroying everything!

40:14.843 --> 40:16.576
Then, why the hell are you here?

40:16.578 --> 40:18.845
Because Michaela's the most
important person in my life.

40:20.883 --> 40:24.784
And you... I don't know
what your deal is.

40:24.786 --> 40:26.586
But I want you out of here
before she comes back.

40:26.588 --> 40:27.954
That's what <i> you</i> want!

40:27.956 --> 40:29.623
You ever think Michaela
might think differently,

40:29.625 --> 40:31.958
or is it always Jared knows best?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.760
Here's what I know...

40:33.762 --> 40:37.230
Michaela and I,
we're meant to be together.

40:37.232 --> 40:38.698
Maybe, maybe not.

40:39.935 --> 40:41.668
Who? You? Huh?

40:41.670 --> 40:43.870
A busted junkie?

41:03.926 --> 41:06.826
Back off!

41:10.265 --> 41:13.033
Zeke... put the gun down.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.301
This is what I bought!

41:14.303 --> 41:16.736
To stop Griffin!
To protect Michaela!

41:21.543 --> 41:23.143
<i>Stop him.</i>

41:30.285 --> 41:33.620
<i>Stop him.</i>

41:35.057 --> 41:36.656
<i>Stop him.</i>
