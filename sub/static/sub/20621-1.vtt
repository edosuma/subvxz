WEBVTT

01:43.854 --> 01:44.939
Oh, fuck!

04:45.619 --> 04:46.787
Hey,
what does this mean?

04:46.870 --> 04:48.664
That means
when something tastes good.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.041
What? How have I lived here for three
months, and I didn't learn that?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.835
I don't know. Well,
there's a bunch of them.

04:52.918 --> 04:57.006
For example, um, this one
means, "I need to leave."

04:57.089 --> 04:58.924
- Okay.
- Or this one...

04:59.008 --> 04:59.883
"Clever."

05:00.634 --> 05:02.594
And then there is this one.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.638
It means, "Good to meet you."

05:04.722 --> 05:06.640
Really? So it's like,
"Good to meet you"?

05:06.724 --> 05:08.434
No. No.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.653
What's happening?

05:19.737 --> 05:20.946
I don't know what some
of those words mean.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.532
Just go with him.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.015
It's-- I was just
asking to be polite.

06:02.488 --> 06:03.655
- Ooh, I have an idea.
- What?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.324
Give me a-- a "grazie mille."

06:05.407 --> 06:07.493
- Grazie mille.
- Prego mille.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.370
Thanks a thousand. You're
welcome a thousand.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.788
- Oh...
- Man, I wouldn't say that.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.997
Make you sound like you're stupid.
Please.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.415
Yeah, nobody's gonna like this.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.167
Come on. Pino,
what do you think?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.794
I like that. Sounds tough.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.003
- See?
- Mm?

06:18.087 --> 06:19.505
You know what Italian
word I love?

06:19.588 --> 06:21.006
Allora.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.549
I don't even know
what it means Allora.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.051
People say it all
the time Allora.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.511
"Hey, what are you
doing?" "Allora."

06:25.594 --> 06:27.388
- What does it mean?
- "Well."

06:27.471 --> 06:29.932
- Really?
- Yeah. Just "well."

06:30.015 --> 06:31.433
Cool word.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.352
Do you guys want to
have lunch later?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.187
Um, I'm going to

06:35.312 --> 06:38.774
Hosteria Giusti for
my birthday...

06:38.857 --> 06:39.858
Is it your birthday today?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.068
- Si.
- Seriously?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.486
Why you didn't tell us?

06:42.569 --> 06:45.739
I don't know. It always feels weird to
be like, "Hey, guys. It's my birthday."

06:45.823 --> 06:46.907
- Come on.
- Hey, guys. Hey.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.159
I have an idea. Listen to this.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.413
Let's do a tour of my
family's style factory.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.124
It's perfect for your birthday.
Hmm?

06:55.207 --> 06:58.210
Yes, we just got a new
black stone from Morocco.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.380
I mean, we call this
stone Black Galaxy.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.589
You've never seen a
black like this.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.674
Close your eyes. Close.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.801
Yeah. What do you see?

07:05.884 --> 07:07.010
Uh, black?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.512
Black, huh? Blacker than that.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.973
- Wow.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wonderful.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.391
Just a quick three-hour drive.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.809
Very quick.
Let's go.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.644
I don't know if a six-hour
round trip sounds like a...

07:15.727 --> 07:16.937
Kind of experience.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.313
I think I'll just go to Giusti.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.566
Yeah. I mean, don't go, Dev.
I love him.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.693
I've been dating him
for, what, ten years?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.278
And I think that place
is really boring.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.571
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.364
It's not true. I mean, listen.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.657
Don't eat the lunch by yourself.
It's sad.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.869
And it's a little bit--
how do you say it? Um...

07:31.952 --> 07:33.537
Loser. Loser. Yeah.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.206
Well, I made the reservation
a long time ago, Pino,

07:36.290 --> 07:37.666
before I knew if I'd
have any friends.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.251
It's fine. I need a
little "me" time.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.419
What's "me" time?

07:40.502 --> 07:41.962
It's, like, time to yourself.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.338
That's sad.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.799
Okay. We celebrate tonight.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.260
I'm gonna have some "me"
time in the bathroom.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.304
Hey. Don't use it like that.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.372
It should
be under "Sara."

08:24.963 --> 08:26.673
Um, I speak a little Italian.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.091
I can try to help you out.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.260
Oh. Yes, please.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.178
Uh...

08:42.105 --> 08:45.108
You made your reservation
for the next month, not for today.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.902
Shit.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.279
Look, I took a three-hour
train to get here.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.865
If there's anything they
can do, I'll sit anywhere.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.283
I'll sit in the dishwasher.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.952
Um, yeah, I-I'll
see what I can do.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.497
Um.. Allora, uh...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.759
Uh, well, you
can tell that was negative.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.220
Um, hold on. One more idea.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.596
Allora.

09:32.406 --> 09:36.368
I have a reservation for one
that I made for my birthday.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.370
If you want to join me,
you're welcome to.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.747
Oh. Um...

09:40.831 --> 09:42.374
I-I don't know.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.589
Come on!
It'll be fine.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.090
Let's just eat.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.592
What are you gonna do,
just wander around here?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.303
Like, this'll be the same as if
you were just eating here anyway,

09:54.386 --> 09:57.598
only now both minorities will
be sitting at the same table.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.227
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.651
I guess we just follow her.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.405
You're not gonna murder
me or anything, are you?

10:13.488 --> 10:14.615
No.

10:14.698 --> 10:18.076
I'm a very basic, basic British girl.
I promise.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.746
What does that mean? Like, you're really
into tea and those tiny sandwiches?

10:20.829 --> 10:24.958
Oh-ho! So we're gonna go for
stereotypes immediately, are we?

10:25.042 --> 10:26.918
You know there's no
strawberries and cream here, right?

10:27.002 --> 10:30.547
There are no strawberries and cream?
I'm obviously leaving, then.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.135
No, I think this'll be fun. We
both seem nice and normal, right?

10:35.218 --> 10:38.096
Uh, well, you
know/seem normal.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.390
I know that much.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.100
- But--
- Grazie.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.602
If this gets weird, by the way,

10:43.685 --> 10:45.937
by which I mean,
if you get weird,

10:46.021 --> 10:47.689
then I'm gonna put
my headphones in,

10:47.773 --> 10:49.441
listen to a podcast,
and just eat the food.

10:49.524 --> 10:52.361
I won't even look at you. It
will be like we're eating alone.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.365
Welll, if you get weird...

10:57.407 --> 10:59.076
I'll do the same thing.
That's a really good plan.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.414
Whoa.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.711
- Oh!
- Oh, man alive.

11:09.795 --> 11:12.422
That is so good.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.883
Dev, thank you again for
sorting this out for me.

11:14.966 --> 11:15.884
Thank you for eating.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.719
I was about to have this sad
birthday lunch by myself.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.096
I don't know what
I was thinking.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.889
It was great. It was
really nice to meet you.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.265
And you.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
And how is your
pasta making going?

11:24.101 --> 11:25.477
Are you any good?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.813
I can confidently say

11:27.896 --> 11:32.818
I am one of the top 50
pasta makers in Modena

11:32.901 --> 11:35.404
of Indian descent.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.989
No, there's three of
us, and we're all bad.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.409
Well, congratulations, anyway.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.910
And when you're
done, do you think

11:41.993 --> 11:43.704
that you'll go back to New York,
or what do you think you'll do?

11:43.787 --> 11:44.705
I don't know.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.833
I love it there, but I like how
quiet and peaceful it is here.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.834
- You know?
- Yeah.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.419
It is a hard city to
be single in, though.

11:50.502 --> 11:54.047
Everyone either has a boyfriend or
a husband, or they are a grandma.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.174
So I don't know.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.927
And you moved here, like, just
after you broke up, right'?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.512
- Mm-hmm.
- So this is your...

12:00.595 --> 12:03.181
Diane Lane, Under the
Tuscan Sun moment.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.349
What's that?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.101
Diane Lane's
husband cheats on her.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.437
She moves to Tuscany, falls
in love with a handyman.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.480
It is the greatest film.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.065
Wait.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.651
So, in Unfaithful, she
cheats on her husband,

12:14.735 --> 12:16.153
and in this one, she
gets cheated on?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.530
What goes around
comes around, Diane Lane.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.532
Um, what about you? What's your story?

12:20.615 --> 12:21.825
- You live in New York.
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.034
What do you do work-wise?

12:23.118 --> 12:25.370
Uh... I used to work in finance.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.413
Oh, cool. What'd you do?

12:26.496 --> 12:28.331
Ugh, God, please don't
pretend to be curious.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.958
Yeah, I know. That "oh,
cool" wasn't genuine.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.376
I regretted it as
soon as I said it.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.170
Uh, finance sucks.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.005
What other stuff?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.048
Relationships. Tell me.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.217
Uh, well, you know,
single right now.

12:39.301 --> 12:42.053
My last relationship
lasted two years.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.847
Uh, one day I came home,

12:43.930 --> 12:46.391
and there was a naked
woman sat on my couch,

12:46.475 --> 12:48.643
watching a documentary
about bees.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.811
What?

12:49.895 --> 12:51.772
Assuming this person was
involved with your boyfriend

12:51.855 --> 12:53.482
and not a nude burglar

12:53.565 --> 12:55.692
that was concerned about
the whole bee die-off.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.862
Yes. Yes, he was
inserting his penis

12:58.945 --> 13:01.364
into her vagina on
a regular basis.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.450
Thank you for reminding me.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.827
That bee documentary,
though, worth a watch.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.788
- Narrated by Ellen Page?
- Yeah.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.790
I'm familiar.

13:09.873 --> 13:10.957
Good, right?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.334
Can I tell you something?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.544
I don't know if I would've
been so keen on inviting you

13:14.628 --> 13:16.630
if you didn't have such a
lovely British accent.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.673
Really?

13:18.757 --> 13:20.050
They're so charming.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.843
Do you think you can do one?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.929
Yeah. All right,
you never met me.

13:24.012 --> 13:24.930
'Ello.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.306
I'm Dev from Devonshire.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.474
I drive a Jaguar,

13:27.557 --> 13:29.518
and I live in Buckingham Palace.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.269
Buckingham Palace?

13:31.353 --> 13:33.730
How did you manage that one?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.607
Found it on Craigslist.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.275
Your accent is terrible.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.318
Bollocks.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.945
It's "bollocks."

13:40.028 --> 13:42.197
- Bollocks.
- No, "bol-locks."

13:42.280 --> 13:43.365
Bollocks!

13:43.448 --> 13:45.700
Okay. Maybe let's not shout
"testicles" in a restaurant.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.369
Fair enough. Cheers.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.287
- Uh-huh.
- And this old couple

13:49.371 --> 13:51.581
were coming down the pavement,
and I didn't know what to do.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.582
- Yeah?
- So rather than stopping,

13:52.666 --> 13:54.417
I turned into the road

13:54.501 --> 13:56.628
and, like, went through all
this oncoming traffic...

13:56.711 --> 13:58.046
- Whoa.
- ...and nearly died.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.130
Ooh. Cobbles.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.715
- That feels...
- Cobbles!

14:00.799 --> 14:04.386
How do you eat all of this
food and stay so skinny?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.346
Secret is, I don't.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.056
I'm getting chubby.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.266
Oh, what's that?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.059
I don't know shit about history.
Looks cool, though.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.436
- You want to snap a pic?
- Yeah, sure.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.566
Uno, due, tre, formaggio!

14:18.608 --> 14:20.527
That means "cheese."
What do you think?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.070
It's rubbish.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
It's good.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.324
Thanks. I can make up
some history about it.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.367
Okay. Go on, then.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.078
This is the first
ever McDonald's PlayPlace.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.838
Thank you so much for
showing me around.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.172
I had a really good time.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.758
- Yeah. I did too. That was so much fun.
- Good.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.177
What are
you up to this weekend?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.096
Um... nothing.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.806
Okay. Good.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.851
Well, some friends and I got
this Airbnb house in Puglia--

14:52.934 --> 14:55.604
- And you want me to come clean it.
- Yes. Yes, I do.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.231
But maybe also hang out with us.
Make us some pasta.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.318
- Yes. That'd be amazing.
- Oh, great.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.528
Um, well, I got your number.
I'll text you.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.654
Perfecto.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.531
No. No. Not perfecto.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.741
Perfetto. No C.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.200
Perfecto is Spanish.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.120
All right, dick. Do you
want to come or...

15:12.203 --> 15:14.122
Yes, I'd love to.
That'd be so much fun.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.457
Thank you.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.960
Urn... I know it's only,
like, 5:00 in the afternoon,

15:19.044 --> 15:21.004
but I've been drinking
a lot of wine today.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.298
I kind of want to
make out with you.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.758
Okay.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.802
Wait, but what if we
wait till Puglia?

15:27.886 --> 15:29.262
That'll be more romantic, right?

15:29.346 --> 15:30.639
Like, our first
kiss is in Puglia?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.140
Sure. Okay. Okay.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.725
- Wait, is that stupid?
- No, I think it's sweet.

15:33.808 --> 15:34.851
- I'm up for it.
- Okay.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.019
Wait, let's just make out now.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.187
I have to go get my train.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.772
- All right.
- Okay. Oh...

15:38.855 --> 15:40.190
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.192
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.911
That was dumb. Should
have just made out now.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.246
Hey!

16:03.338 --> 16:04.506
Fuck!
Her phone number!

16:44.337 --> 16:46.548
Uh, so there
is no security cameras,

16:46.631 --> 16:49.426
but he asked if you tried the
"find your iPhone" program.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.636
No, I turned it off
'cause of international data.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.554
Oh.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.354
Well, he
said that's too bad,

17:01.438 --> 17:03.148
because in this case, it
would've been very useful

17:03.231 --> 17:04.190
to have it on.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.026
Come si dice "no shit"?

17:06.109 --> 17:08.235
- Do you want me to translate that?
- No.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.070
Um... oh.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.617
- Ah! Si! Okay. Okay.
- Police sketch artist.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.390
That he likes
to draw comic strips

17:37.474 --> 17:39.642
of funny things that
happen in the station.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.565
That's
funny, because in Italy,

17:45.648 --> 17:48.610
we have policeman that
likes pastries a lot,

17:48.693 --> 17:49.611
so it's actually...

17:49.694 --> 17:50.653
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.490
We have the same
stereotype in America too.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.075
I'm so sorry. I'm so s--

17:55.158 --> 17:56.826
It's fine. Uh, you
head back to the shop.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.577
I'll just keep
looking with Mario.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.080
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.049
Si, si, si. Grazie. Ciao.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.825
The fuck that
guy kiss his phone for?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.436
Why can't you be like American kids?
They 're all spoiled and have phones.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.319
What's going on? Are
we gonna look for the phone?

22:55.583 --> 22:57.543
We can't find the phone.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.004
He's not going to admit it.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.883
Every one of his neighbors will
just say he was somewhere else.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.804
Do you really want to push the
issue against this guy, huh?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.139
It would be easier just
to get a new phone.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.746
Well, damn. You
could still come and hang out.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.669
Ciao.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.218
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.678
Happy birthday.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.805
- Thanks.
- I have some gifts for you.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.807
This is from Nonna. Lasagna.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.101
My favorite lasagna?
Special birthday batch?

24:37.185 --> 24:39.479
Well, it's actually
just leftovers.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.481
- Hey.
- I'm kidding.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.065
- Of course it's a special thing.
- Cool.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.150
That's from Pino.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.068
A piece of tile?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.737
It's Black Galaxy tile.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.031
It's so black.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.200
From me. That's
Maurizio Cattelan.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.911
He's my favorite
Italian artist ever.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.079
I did a thesis on him at school.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.790
- Cool.
- Just cool? Seriously?

24:59.874 --> 25:02.502
Look at this. Hard cover.
It's a special book.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.378
Special edition. Come on.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.172
I'm sorry. Grazie mille.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.132
I'm not gonna say "prego mille."

25:10.301 --> 25:12.929
What's up? What's
wrong with you?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.305
Why are you so sad?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.140
You still thinking
about that girl?

25:16.224 --> 25:18.643
I just haven't met anyone I had
a connection with like that

25:18.726 --> 25:19.810
in a long time,

25:19.894 --> 25:23.731
and it's gonna go away
for a stupid reason.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.817
Yes, I know, but, I mean,
you just met her once.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.487
You don't know her at all.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.865
Maybe she was one of those person that
just love to put people in a basement

25:32.949 --> 25:34.408
and leave them forever.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.994
Maybe the Puglia thing
was just a trap.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.621
Maybe.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.581
Give me a smile.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.959
Better smile.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.379
