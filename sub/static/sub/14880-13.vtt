Why is Mossad investigating
Khalid Ansari?

You put me on this because
I'm good at handling Eyal.

from the army.

My parents
had been scraping by,

04:14.598 --> 04:16.399
but then the payments
just stopped.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.401
Now they're behind
on their mortgage.

could pull a few strings.

- It's compelling.
- My opinion hasn't changed.

We shouldn't be digging
into Khalid Ansari.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.451

the whole Ansari family

05:47.725 --> 05:49.359

we track down this meeting

or location?

an American.

06:00.837 --> 06:02.372
- Yes.
- And based on its contents,

06:02.473 --> 06:04.807
it appears Mossad
also had access to the intel

06:04.874 --> 06:06.108
from the watch drive.

Am I to assume that you
shared it with Eyal Lavin,

asked you not to?

06:11.513 --> 06:12.913

with this new intel.

to get out.

11:43.501 --> 11:46.003
I have a few minutes
until my lunch.

11:46.104 --> 11:48.572
Let's grab a drink.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.277
I know you're busy,
so I'll get right to the point.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.980
My employer
needs to locate Khalid.

11:56.047 --> 11:58.616
All we need you to do
is make one phone call to him.

11:58.683 --> 12:00.517
You can drop
the "my employer" charade.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.287
The second I started dating
a Saudi businessman

12:03.355 --> 12:06.791
with ties to oil, I knew
the CIA would come calling.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.526
Racial profiling
is alive and well.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.362
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.699
No, you're here because
you suspect Khalid of something,

12:13.800 --> 12:16.002
but he's not the man
that you think he is.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.972
We met on a panel
at an energy summit in Berlin.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.676
He's charming.
He's cosmopolitan.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.513
He's not the kind of man that
I expected to fall in love with,

12:27.615 --> 12:30.884
but he makes me feel alive

12:30.985 --> 12:33.153
in a way that I haven't

12:33.220 --> 12:36.990
in a long time.

12:37.058 --> 12:39.192
And you've never seen
any warning signals--

12:39.260 --> 12:43.730
long, unexplained absences,
questionable business dealings?

12:43.831 --> 12:47.233
We have an understanding--
no questions about work.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.901
Sometimes what you don't know
can hurt you.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.636
Every relationship
that you've ever been in,

12:50.704 --> 12:52.137
you've had full transparency?

12:52.205 --> 12:56.708
Trusted your partner
completely?

12:56.809 --> 12:58.509
There have been
leaps of faith.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.912
How long have you been
at the Agency?

13:01.013 --> 13:02.980
Two years.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.551
When I was your age,
I thought I could have it all--

13:06.652 --> 13:10.488
perfect job, perfect husband.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.723
I judged other women
for their choices,

13:11.824 --> 13:13.591
the same way that you're
judging me right now.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.395
Dating Khalid
is no ordinary choice.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.763
You could be subpoenaed
by the ethics committee.

13:19.864 --> 13:21.065
You could lose your career.

13:21.132 --> 13:23.734
You don't choose
who you fall in love with,

13:23.835 --> 13:25.736
no matter
how much baggage they have.

13:25.804 --> 13:31.209
Complicated people
have complicated relationships.

13:31.276 --> 13:35.246
Is that a gift
from someone special?

13:35.314 --> 13:38.916
It's a gift.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.918
There's my lunch.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.755
If you and I are so similar,
then you know I do this job

13:43.856 --> 13:46.791
because I love my country
and I want to serve.

13:46.892 --> 13:49.527
I think you do too.

13:49.594 --> 13:52.063
I'm sorry.
Good luck.

13:52.130 --> 13:56.800
Hi. How are you?
Thanks for coming.

14:00.805 --> 14:02.940
Check, please.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.942
This mission was a high-wire
to begin with.

14:05.009 --> 14:08.278
Now you want authorization for
a level-three document removal?

14:08.346 --> 14:10.747
Given the time constraints,
I feel it's our only option.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.449
Do you know
what a big risk this is,

14:12.517 --> 14:15.285
taking top-secret documents
out of this building?

14:15.387 --> 14:16.687
Not just documents.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.989
I also want surveillance photos
from project Panther.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.092
A domestic
surveillance program

14:21.159 --> 14:22.560
we don't acknowledge exists.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.162
Megan is either in denial
about Khalid's true nature,

14:24.263 --> 14:25.597
or she's unusually loyal.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.566
But I think if she saw
the information we're seeing,

14:27.633 --> 14:29.234
she could be convinced
to cooperate.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.468
And if this fails

14:30.536 --> 14:31.904
and she turns around
and tells her bosses,

14:31.971 --> 14:33.739
we'll both be testifying
before Congress.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.108
I don't think we have
any other option.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.245
Khalid and al Masri are meeting
within a matter of hours.

14:39.313 --> 14:42.315
This is a lot to risk
based on intel from Mossad.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.484
Are you sure it's valid?

14:44.585 --> 14:46.486
Are you sure
it's trustworthy?

14:46.554 --> 14:47.954
Yes.

14:48.022 --> 14:50.957
You're willing to stake
your reputation, your career?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.825
Absolutely.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.000
I suppose you already have.

15:14.415 --> 15:17.017
Hey, not so fast.

15:17.118 --> 15:19.520
You are a tough girl
to get a hold of.

15:19.588 --> 15:21.188
Why, were you trying
to get a hold of me?

15:21.289 --> 15:22.656
Got a hold of you now.

15:22.724 --> 15:24.224
Far be it from me
to stir the pot,

15:24.325 --> 15:26.560
but you may have some
fence-mending to do with Joan.

15:26.661 --> 15:28.628
I have intel on a potential
terrorist meeting,

15:28.696 --> 15:30.697
and Joan wouldn't let me
follow it down.

15:30.765 --> 15:32.699
That intel came
from a competing spy service.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.734
So it's okay to use Eyal
to get me out of Russia,

15:34.835 --> 15:36.202
but now he's untrustworthy?

15:36.270 --> 15:37.871
- That's not what this is about.
- Then what's it about?

15:37.939 --> 15:40.039
This building,
this family.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.875
Someday you're going
to need Joan.

15:41.976 --> 15:44.210
Bureaucracy has a funny way
of keeping people together.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.845
This is actionable intel,
Auggie.

15:45.913 --> 15:48.714
I hear you.
Just keep your guard up, okay?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.583
You know I don't have feelings
for Eyal, right?

15:51.685 --> 15:54.654
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.072
Thanks for digging in--
I think there's still room

16:13.140 --> 16:15.174
to reach across the aisle
on this one.

16:15.242 --> 16:18.678
Thank you.

16:18.746 --> 16:20.280
Two visits in one lunch.

16:20.381 --> 16:22.849
I'll give you one thing--
you don't lack for persistence.

16:22.916 --> 16:25.918
These are contributions
to supposed charities

16:25.986 --> 16:28.255
that are fronts
for radical groups.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.590
If we believed every paranoid
analyst from Langley,

16:30.691 --> 16:33.794
we'd have to round up the entire
adult male population

16:33.895 --> 16:34.861
of Saudi Arabia.

16:34.929 --> 16:36.930
It's not just
from any analyst.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.264
This evidence is solid.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.367
Look, I am just
as patriotic as you are,

16:40.434 --> 16:44.438
but I am not about to betray
somebody that I care about

16:44.505 --> 16:46.474
based on speculation.

16:46.575 --> 16:49.043
- Do you recognize this man?
- He doesn't look familiar.

16:49.111 --> 16:51.079
He's been sitting in the lobby
since you arrived.

16:51.147 --> 16:52.447
Right now he's wondering

16:52.515 --> 16:56.284
why your lunch date has left
and you're still here.

16:56.385 --> 16:59.121
It's a busy hotel.
He could be here for any reason.

16:59.222 --> 17:03.659
I believe Khalid hired him
to keep tabs on you.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.595
I'm sure you're aware
how illegal it is

17:06.662 --> 17:09.097
to surveil and photograph
U.S. citizens.

17:09.165 --> 17:12.333
I am, but I thought
you needed to see this.

17:12.435 --> 17:15.170
You've extended
unquestioned trust

17:15.271 --> 17:17.071
and loyalty to Khalid,

17:17.140 --> 17:18.941
and he has not offered you
the same.

17:19.008 --> 17:21.443
Don't do this for me
or for the Agency

17:21.511 --> 17:23.512
or even for your country.

17:23.613 --> 17:24.813
Do it for him.

17:24.914 --> 17:26.147
If we track down Khalid

17:26.249 --> 17:28.150
and it turns out
his dealings are above board,

17:28.251 --> 17:31.286
then you can sleep better,
confident you proved us wrong.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.788
And if you're right?

17:32.855 --> 17:36.357
Then maybe this relationship
is a little too complicated.

17:40.629 --> 17:43.197
You're sure the guy
from the lobby didn't see us?

17:43.298 --> 17:44.499
Positive.
We're good.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
I texted Khalid.

17:45.668 --> 17:46.868
He doesn't take
any incoming calls.

17:46.968 --> 17:48.269
All right,
when you get him on the phone,

17:48.336 --> 17:50.104
wait 40 seconds.

17:50.172 --> 17:51.972
That's how long it takes
to establish a trace.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.941
[Car alarm deactivates]
Maybe you should text him again.

17:54.009 --> 17:55.610
He's going to know
that something is off.

17:55.678 --> 17:57.512
We just have to wait.

17:57.580 --> 18:00.347
[Cell phone ringing]

18:00.415 --> 18:04.351
[Whispering]
40 seconds.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.353
Hey. Hi.
I'm glad you called.

18:06.454 --> 18:08.655
This isn't a good time.
What's so important?

18:08.723 --> 18:10.191
Not even a hello?

18:10.292 --> 18:11.792
I'm about to leave
on a flight.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.528
Well, there's
a congressional delegation

18:14.629 --> 18:16.195
going to Bahrain next week.

18:16.297 --> 18:18.164
Can you meet me?
This will have to wait.

18:18.232 --> 18:19.365
I'll call you back tomorrow.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.200
Well, I have to let them know
by tonight.

18:21.302 --> 18:22.435
I can't meet you next week.

18:22.503 --> 18:24.871
My work schedule
is too unpredictable right now.

18:24.972 --> 18:26.539
Well, when would be
a good time, then?

18:26.607 --> 18:30.877
Just 15 more seconds.

18:30.945 --> 18:32.512
Megan, you don't sound
like yourself.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.381
Is something wrong?

18:34.482 --> 18:37.150
Yeah, something's wrong.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.320
Khalid, I'm just tired of
all these mysterious absences,

18:40.387 --> 18:43.056
of never knowing where
you're going to be and when.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.559
Don't you trust me enough
to be honest?

18:45.626 --> 18:46.593
Where is this coming from?

18:46.661 --> 18:48.062
I thought we had
an understanding.

18:48.163 --> 18:49.830
40 seconds.

18:49.898 --> 18:51.898
I'm putting a lot
at risk here,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.402
and I just need to know
that your heart is in it.

18:55.503 --> 18:59.005
[Jet engines starting]

18:59.073 --> 19:00.440
[Sighs]

19:00.541 --> 19:03.243
I'll call you back, hmm?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.545
We'll plan a trip
somewhere special.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.747
No delegations,
just us.

19:10.216 --> 19:13.519
- Thank you, Khalid.
- Good-bye, Megan.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.088
Thank you.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.057
You did the right thing.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.292
I just spooked my boyfriend

19:20.393 --> 19:22.527
by pretending to be
the clingy woman

19:22.595 --> 19:26.198
that I vowed
I never would be, so...

19:26.266 --> 19:28.534
We'll see.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.959
Annie got the I.M.E.I. trace
on Khalid. So...

19:40.346 --> 19:42.847
his plane just left Riyadh
for Bannu.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.682
I thought
I wasn't cleared on this.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.051
I'm clearing you.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.486
You know the region.
You know the players.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.021
This originated in the D.P.D.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.825
We need you.
I need you.

19:52.893 --> 19:54.294
What are the next steps?

19:54.362 --> 19:55.696
The White House
classified al Masri

19:55.797 --> 19:57.364
as number 17 on the kill list.

19:57.432 --> 19:58.799
He's pre-approved
for termination.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.300
So, if we can get a clear shot,

20:00.368 --> 20:02.068
we can take him out
by reaper drone.

20:02.169 --> 20:03.570
And Khalid?

20:03.671 --> 20:05.205
His intention of partnering
with a terrorist

20:05.272 --> 20:07.874
makes him a viable target too.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.510
What about his protectors
at state?

20:10.578 --> 20:12.379
Well, we'll have to go over
their heads to the White House.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.514
Oh, seems like the work-around
is a trend these days.

20:14.582 --> 20:17.884
We'll be vetting it internally
with legal first.

20:17.951 --> 20:21.487
Seth, thanks for coming.
Let's get right to it.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.696
I'm looking for the private
who locked Nick Fox

20:30.764 --> 20:33.400
in his wall locker
at Fort Benning.

20:33.501 --> 20:35.234
[Laughs]

20:35.302 --> 20:36.936
Auggie, man,
how the hell are you?

20:37.037 --> 20:38.037
Hey, hey.

20:38.105 --> 20:40.039
Thanks for getting me in
on short notice.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.440
I'll take it from here.
Thank you.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.741
Thank you.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.410
Oh, I still owe you
about 10,000 push-ups

20:44.477 --> 20:45.944
from basic training--
it's the least I can do.

20:46.046 --> 20:49.748
Just going to go right in here.
All right.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.716
I checked out
your friend's file.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.586
His parents left a signature
off their P.D.I.C. renewal form,

20:54.687 --> 20:58.757
so it has been buried in a pile
for the last two months.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.393
How long is it going to take
to get out of the pile?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.028
Normally, with our backlog,
three to six months.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.296
[Sighs]

21:04.364 --> 21:07.299
Listen, I hate to ask
for favors like this,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.435
but this is
a special case.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.937
I feel personally responsible
for this guy's parents--

21:12.005 --> 21:13.172
Oh, say no more.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.443
They will have a check
by the end of the week.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.278
Consider your push-ups
paid off.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.613
Thank you.

21:20.681 --> 21:22.381
You sound good,
by the way.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.783
Last time we talked--

21:23.851 --> 21:26.553
Yeah, I know.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.722
Hey, Kip, we don't need
to dredge up anything

21:28.790 --> 21:30.390
you feel is best
left behind, okay?

21:30.458 --> 21:31.558
Ah, what are you
talking about?

21:31.626 --> 21:32.927
I was a pissed-off,
miserable drunk

21:32.994 --> 21:34.628
from the day I got back
from Iraq.

21:34.730 --> 21:36.330
Something needed to change.

21:36.431 --> 21:37.965
I did a tour
with operation: Proper Exit.

21:38.066 --> 21:39.667
Oh, is that the group
that takes injured vets

21:39.768 --> 21:41.001
back to Iraq?
Yeah.

21:41.103 --> 21:42.636
You know what?
You should do it.

21:42.738 --> 21:44.305
Oh, I feel like I've made
my peace with all that.

21:44.372 --> 21:46.440
Well, that's why you should go
as a battle buddy.

21:46.508 --> 21:48.142
They're looking for officers
with your experience.

21:48.243 --> 21:49.676
- Battle buddy?
- Yeah.

21:49.778 --> 21:51.245
Not everybody's been able
to move on like you.

21:51.313 --> 21:55.782
You'd be doing some fellow grunt
out there a world of good.

21:55.850 --> 21:57.351
We've geo-synched
this photo of al Masri

21:57.452 --> 21:59.486
to a compound just outside
of Miranshah,

21:59.554 --> 22:02.956
which lines up with the GPS
trace of Khalid's trajectory.

22:03.024 --> 22:04.758
What about
the taxonomy of targets?

22:04.826 --> 22:06.827
C.T.'s run this
six ways from Sunday.

22:06.928 --> 22:08.528
There are no schools,
hospitals, or mosques

22:08.629 --> 22:09.796
in the blast radius.

22:09.864 --> 22:11.798
Less than a 3% chance
of collateral damage.

22:11.866 --> 22:14.001
Well, that's well within
near certainty standards.

22:14.102 --> 22:15.636
And you've back-checked
these coordinates

22:15.703 --> 22:17.037
with additional sources?

22:17.138 --> 22:18.472
N.S.A.'s looking into calls.

22:18.540 --> 22:19.840
N.G.A.'S culling SAT imagery.

22:19.941 --> 22:22.143
Joan, where's D.P.D.
on all this?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.677
Annie's checked in with me.

22:23.778 --> 22:25.712
She's got Khalid's girlfriend
on standby

22:25.814 --> 22:27.214
if we need
further information.

22:27.282 --> 22:29.349
What kind of legal cover
do we need to strike both men?

22:29.450 --> 22:31.952
Al Masri's a clean case.
He's on the kill list.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.887
But I'm worried
about targeting Khalid.

22:33.988 --> 22:35.990
I don't need
the Secretary of State

22:36.057 --> 22:38.393
and two former Presidents
asking me why I killed

22:38.494 --> 22:39.861
the son of their favorite
golf buddy.

22:39.962 --> 22:41.730
Oh, we can't let
terrorists roam free

22:41.831 --> 22:44.332
just 'cause their daddies
have a ten handicap.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.535
The intel does show
clear intent to harm.

22:46.636 --> 22:48.503
There's still a lot
we don't know about Khalid.

22:48.571 --> 22:50.072
And after
the Lena Smith scandal,

22:50.173 --> 22:51.640
we can't afford
to be asleep at the wheel.

22:51.708 --> 22:54.243
I'll call the White House
for revised strike authority.

22:54.344 --> 22:57.080
Have C.T.C.
get a package ready.

23:05.589 --> 23:07.891
What's going on
between you and Seth Newman?

23:07.992 --> 23:11.661
You didn't make eye contact
during this whole meeting.

23:11.729 --> 23:14.931
I'm not a fan
of letting legal

23:15.032 --> 23:16.699
dictate covert operations.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.001
That's not it.

23:18.068 --> 23:19.903
We've been
in hundreds of meetings

23:20.004 --> 23:21.738
with lawyers sitting in.

23:21.839 --> 23:23.607
This was different.

23:27.545 --> 23:29.913
I needed someone to talk to,
so I've been talking to him.

23:29.981 --> 23:32.182
- Talking?
- Nothing happened.

23:32.250 --> 23:35.119
When you're not talking
to your husband,

23:35.220 --> 23:39.256
that's not nothing.

23:39.357 --> 23:40.791
- Arthur--
- When the man you choose

23:40.859 --> 23:43.394
to talk to is your former lover,
that's certainly not nothing.

23:43.462 --> 23:45.763
And when you take your wife
off the H.V.T. list,

23:45.830 --> 23:48.098
that's not nothing either.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.433
[Knock at door]

23:50.501 --> 23:52.468
Greg McCarthy from C.T.C.
is ready for you

23:52.569 --> 23:54.203
in the command center.
Thanks, Midge.

24:06.350 --> 24:09.251
[Sighs]

24:14.024 --> 24:15.758
Looks like I owe you
an apology.

24:15.826 --> 24:16.960
Yeah?
For what?

24:17.061 --> 24:18.394
I shouldn't have doubted
that file.

24:18.462 --> 24:20.496
Not only did C.T.C.
track down the meeting,

24:20.597 --> 24:23.499
Arthur's ordered a drone strike
against al Masri and Khalid.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.567
A drone strike?

24:24.634 --> 24:25.768
For or against
the drone program,

24:25.836 --> 24:26.969
it's part of the job.

24:27.037 --> 24:28.771
- When's that going down?
- 30 minutes.

24:28.838 --> 24:30.639
And you got to tell me
what it's like--I want details.

24:30.707 --> 24:32.274
- What do you mean?
- Arthur wants you there,

24:32.342 --> 24:33.842
in the room--

24:33.943 --> 24:35.644
a vault not even I've been to,
and I've got this place dialed.

24:35.712 --> 24:36.978
I can't believe
he ordered a drone strike.

24:37.046 --> 24:38.246
What did you think
was going to happen

24:38.314 --> 24:39.648
when you brought in
this intel?

24:39.715 --> 24:41.850
- Uh, where--where's--
- Subbasement level four...

24:41.951 --> 24:44.819
past Persia house,
second vault on the left.

24:44.921 --> 24:46.855
That's the drone room?
I've passed that door 100 times.

24:46.956 --> 24:49.425
And now you get to open it.

24:56.476 --> 24:57.961
This compound is located

24:57.963 --> 25:00.598
two kilometers
outside of Miranshah.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.935
Till recently, the area was
controlled by the local tribes.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.903
It looks like
al Masri and Khalid

25:06.004 --> 25:08.706
are using it
as a neutral meeting ground.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.174
Annie, you brought this in.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.742
You should be here
to see it through.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.045
This photo, provided
by Mossad this morning,

25:15.113 --> 25:17.881
shows al Masri
entering his compound.

25:17.949 --> 25:21.351
Humint on the ground confirms
no one has been seen

25:21.419 --> 25:22.953
leaving the compound since.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.455
And this picture,
provided by N.G.A.,

25:25.556 --> 25:28.792
gives us a broader scope.

25:28.893 --> 25:31.862
Now, this image is
from eight minutes ago--

25:31.929 --> 25:34.765
shows Khalid arriving
at the compound.

25:34.832 --> 25:37.968
We just got White House
approval to strike.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.470
Here we go.
Initiate operation.

25:40.571 --> 25:42.439
I'd like to go on record
saying this strike

25:42.507 --> 25:44.575
is the wrong
counterterrorism play.

25:44.643 --> 25:47.612
Al Masri's a clear case,
but Annie's turning Megan Carr

25:47.713 --> 25:49.279
changed the equation
of Khalid Ansari.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.282
We know next to nothing
about him.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.785
We need to know more
before we act.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.453
Megan can offer us a way in.

25:55.521 --> 25:58.123
Annie, can Megan get us
more on Khalid?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.391
With the right handling, yes.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.293
What about the intel
that arrived today?

26:01.394 --> 26:03.095
Are you telling me
that intel's not valid?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.396
No, sir.
It's rock-solid.

26:04.464 --> 26:06.498
And the intel says
that Khalid's a terrorist.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.300
How can we win
the war on terrorism

26:08.401 --> 26:09.601
if we don't kill terrorists?

26:09.669 --> 26:12.971
We take out al Masri,
but we let Khalid walk.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.307
We can listen to his calls,
trace his money,

26:15.408 --> 26:17.976
follow his trail before
he even knows what's happening.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.778
The intel Annie brought in
is compelling.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.313
It's bumped us up
to actionable class.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.781
Get the drone in the air.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.516
Operation Sigma-5
is a go.

26:25.617 --> 26:29.754
We're Mary in two Mikes.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.768
[Plane engine whirring]

27:02.488 --> 27:03.989
I just got off
with the N.S.C.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.390
We're approved
to hit both men.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.726
As soon as the drone's
in place, we can strike.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.528
25 klicks
to target area.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.998
As a lawyer, what are
your thoughts on all this?

27:12.065 --> 27:14.200
Well, the drone's
a thinking man's weapon.

27:14.301 --> 27:15.868
It's forceful, precise,

27:15.970 --> 27:18.505
no collateral damage
to the civilians or the pilots.

27:18.573 --> 27:19.873
20 klicks to target area.

27:19.974 --> 27:22.042
One day a man can be
a close ally,

27:22.143 --> 27:23.843
the next day
I'm sentencing him to death.

27:23.911 --> 27:27.480
Amazing how fast our friends
become our enemies.

27:27.548 --> 27:31.352
There's always
collateral damage, Seth...

27:31.419 --> 27:33.387
always.

at a moving target.

Actually, he can.

29:29.674 --> 29:31.441
He knows we won't fire
near civilians,

for Miranshah town center.

I'd like to speak
with Frank.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.483
Can I take a message?

33:39.550 --> 33:41.551
I'll call back.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.326
You told me
that he wouldn't find out.

33:50.394 --> 33:52.295
I promise you,
I thought that too.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.297
How does it feel
to put innocent people

33:54.365 --> 33:56.633
in harm's way
to advance your own career?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.835
Megan, nobody put you
in this position but yourself.

33:58.903 --> 34:00.403
As soon as you got involved
with Khalid,

34:00.504 --> 34:01.971
you became compromised.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.539
You can be as angry
as you want,

34:03.607 --> 34:06.209
but that does not change
the situation.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.679
Please let me protect you.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.382
[Sighs]

34:12.483 --> 34:14.583
Stay close.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.360
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

34:24.428 --> 34:26.195
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.735
Megan.

34:50.284 --> 34:52.253
You afraid of heights?
Do I have a choice?

34:52.321 --> 34:53.521
This way.

34:57.893 --> 34:59.027
Come on, come on.

35:21.918 --> 35:24.920
[Catwalk creaking]

35:51.883 --> 35:53.750
Aah!

35:53.818 --> 35:55.652
[Gunshot]

35:59.424 --> 36:00.924
Aah!

36:00.992 --> 36:03.026
[Thud]

36:20.695 --> 36:24.265
Annie,
can I see you a moment?

36:34.775 --> 36:37.610
DNA checks are under way
on al Masri's body.

36:37.711 --> 36:40.780
Khalid's in the wind,
but we're looking for him.

36:40.881 --> 36:43.416
- About today--
- What's done is done.

36:47.321 --> 36:48.422
How are you?

36:48.489 --> 36:50.791
I'm a little sore,
but I'm okay.

36:50.859 --> 36:53.727
That's not what I mean.

36:53.795 --> 36:58.299
I'll report
to Bluebonnet tomorrow.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.635
That may not be
an option anymore.

37:00.702 --> 37:01.769
What do you mean?

37:01.837 --> 37:03.471
We had a failed
drone strike today

37:03.572 --> 37:06.106
because of intelligence
you brought into the building.

37:06.174 --> 37:08.309
What do you think it means?

37:08.410 --> 37:09.810
It wasn't a failure.
We got al Masri.

37:09.911 --> 37:12.446
There was a lot
of collateral damage, Annie.

37:12.514 --> 37:15.317
State Department is irate.
The Saudis are livid.

37:15.418 --> 37:16.985
Khalid will likely go
underground.

37:17.053 --> 37:18.453
You're going to put this
all on me.

37:18.521 --> 37:21.156
You clearly put yourself
in someone else's camp.

37:21.224 --> 37:22.591
Arthur validated
that decision.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.827
- I'm talking about Eyal.
- Eyal?

37:24.928 --> 37:27.162
Eyal put his life
on the line for me.

37:27.230 --> 37:30.032
He has proven himself
in times of crisis.

37:30.133 --> 37:33.102
Annie, we are always
here for you.

37:35.806 --> 37:37.840
When my friend died
in a car bomb,

37:37.908 --> 37:39.809
you let me get reassigned.

37:39.877 --> 37:42.645
When I got thrown
into a Russian prison,

37:42.713 --> 37:46.649
you let me rot
without a shred of hope.

37:46.717 --> 37:47.850
Eyal got me out.

37:47.918 --> 37:50.319
And now you're questioning
my integrity

37:50.387 --> 37:52.955
because of my relationship
with him?

37:53.023 --> 37:55.457
A relationship
you encouraged me to exploit,

37:55.525 --> 37:57.959
as long as it was convenient
for this agency.

38:01.396 --> 38:03.630
You know what?

38:06.668 --> 38:08.235
I'm done.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.741
I'm...

38:14.842 --> 38:18.077
done.

38:18.179 --> 38:19.980
Our relationship
is clearly more broken

38:20.047 --> 38:23.383
than I ever thought it was.

38:23.451 --> 38:25.052
I didn't mean to say "you."

38:25.153 --> 38:28.221
I think you meant to say
exactly what you said.

38:28.322 --> 38:31.091
Perhaps your place inside
this building lies elsewhere.

38:31.192 --> 38:33.360
A few months ago,
you applied to transfer

38:33.427 --> 38:34.694
out of this division.

38:34.762 --> 38:37.096
Maybe it's time
we revisited that option.

38:37.197 --> 38:38.598
I'm sorry
you feel that way.

38:38.699 --> 38:42.167
Sorry doesn't even begin
to describe how I'm feeling.

38:47.374 --> 38:49.007
Good night, Annie.

39:07.392 --> 39:09.927
[Door closes]

39:13.799 --> 39:14.800
Hey.

39:14.901 --> 39:18.803
Ready to go home?

39:18.904 --> 39:21.773
I'm going to take a cab.

39:21.874 --> 39:24.743
This is where you can reach me,
just for the next few days.

39:26.912 --> 39:29.280
The Mayflower?

39:32.251 --> 39:34.453
Why are you staying
in a hotel?

39:34.554 --> 39:35.921
Oh, it's just
for a few days.

39:35.989 --> 39:37.823
I just need to clear my head.

39:37.924 --> 39:40.125
Because I spoke up
in the drone room?

39:40.193 --> 39:42.961
Oh, please. You know
what I'm talking about.

39:43.029 --> 39:45.497
Arthur, please
don't overreact.

39:45.598 --> 39:47.165
That's exactly
why I'm doing this,

39:47.266 --> 39:48.667
'cause I don't want
to overreact.

39:48.768 --> 39:51.136
I don't want to try to hash
this out while I'm angry.

39:51.203 --> 39:52.737
But I ended it with Seth.

39:52.805 --> 39:57.342
The fact that you had
to end it is the problem.

39:57.443 --> 40:01.078
I really don't think I can
take you leaving right now.

40:01.146 --> 40:04.315
We'll get through this.

40:04.416 --> 40:06.984
I just need
a little distance.

40:07.052 --> 40:08.953
Arthur, wait.

40:14.559 --> 40:17.294
There's something
I need to tell you.

40:22.501 --> 40:25.670
[Telephone ringing]

40:25.738 --> 40:26.938
Hello?

40:27.006 --> 40:28.841
Remember when you said
you could use

40:28.909 --> 40:30.175
several cold beers tonight?

40:30.277 --> 40:32.545
[Chuckles]
I never said that.

40:32.646 --> 40:34.513
Maybe that was me.

40:34.581 --> 40:36.382
Anyway, Allen's?

40:36.483 --> 40:38.651
You can tell me
all about the drone room.

40:38.719 --> 40:40.353
They let you
back into Allen's?

40:40.454 --> 40:42.655
Turns out the manager's
an Orioles fan.

40:42.722 --> 40:46.159
It is amazing what box seats
at Camden Yards will do.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.527
It's going to be a while.

40:47.594 --> 40:51.196
I have to complete this
after-action report for Joan.

40:51.264 --> 40:53.298
I don't want to leave
anything unfinished.

40:53.366 --> 40:54.833
What does that mean?

40:54.901 --> 40:57.869
Remember that fence-mending
we were talking about earlier?

40:57.937 --> 40:59.905
That fence
is kind of obliterated.

41:00.006 --> 41:03.041
[Sighs]
You really do need a beer.

41:03.109 --> 41:04.376
I do.

41:04.477 --> 41:06.746
But I have to finish this.

41:06.847 --> 41:09.182
If I could clone myself,
I would be right there.

41:09.249 --> 41:10.483
Wow.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.885
More than one Annie Walker--

41:12.986 --> 41:15.887
that would be something.
[Chuckles]

41:15.955 --> 41:18.990
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:44.114 --> 41:45.281
Sorry.
I tried to stop her.

41:45.382 --> 41:46.949
Annie, this needs to wait.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.385
Haven't we already
said it all, Annie?

41:49.452 --> 41:50.719
The photos were doctored.

41:50.787 --> 41:54.757
Al Masri was never
at the compound.

41:54.858 --> 41:57.927
So we launched a drone strike
based on faulty intel.

41:58.028 --> 41:59.896
Mossad played us.

41:59.964 --> 42:02.599
No, Eyal played you.
