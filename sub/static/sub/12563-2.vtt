retainer patients, Dr. Van Dyke

10:24.961 --> 10:27.495
is gonna handle all house calls for now.

10:27.497 --> 10:29.196
I made schedules, they're in the binders,

10:29.198 --> 10:30.965
under... under "schedules."

10:30.967 --> 10:31.966
[Groans]

10:31.968 --> 10:34.936
Hey. Uh, morning.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.471
Hey, yeah.

10:37.473 --> 10:39.807
You know Dr. Van Dyke,
and you met Dr. Sacani.

10:39.809 --> 10:42.343
I did.

10:42.345 --> 10:45.212
Evan, uh, when you're done
with your meeting, can we talk?

10:45.214 --> 10:49.250
We, uh... we just finished the meeting.

10:49.252 --> 10:50.384
So, uh, yeah.

10:50.386 --> 10:53.454
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

10:53.456 --> 10:55.856
Good talk.

10:58.026 --> 11:01.562
You know, Evan, it occurs to me

11:01.564 --> 11:03.297
that your brother is a doctor.

11:03.299 --> 11:04.732
Yup.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.233
Whose name is Hank.

11:06.235 --> 11:08.336
That's right, Jeremiah.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.505
Uh, it's actually a long story,
which I will tell you.

11:11.507 --> 11:12.807
Um...

11:12.809 --> 11:16.844
at another time.

11:19.715 --> 11:23.050
[Sighs]
Just thought we'd get, uh, an early start.

11:23.052 --> 11:24.485
You know, uh...

11:24.487 --> 11:28.889
Listen, last night...
what happened out there,

11:28.891 --> 11:31.258
what almost happened to you,

11:31.260 --> 11:32.994
it gave me some much-needed perspect...

11:32.996 --> 11:34.729
I'm sorry, is that tattoo
still on your face?

11:34.731 --> 11:37.665
I know. Rubbing alcohol or acetone, right?

11:37.667 --> 11:41.335
Yeah, those are good,
or something a little gentler.

11:41.337 --> 11:43.904
Come here, sit down.

11:43.906 --> 11:46.173
- I'm afraid.
- Don't be.

11:46.175 --> 11:50.778
- Olive oil?
- Yep, that's right, my friend.

12:01.323 --> 12:04.892
Okay, and...

12:04.894 --> 12:06.727
there you go. Good as new.

12:06.729 --> 12:09.363
All gone.

12:09.365 --> 12:10.431
Thanks.

12:10.433 --> 12:13.300
It was hard to take you seriously.

12:13.302 --> 12:17.738
So, um, as I was... as I was saying...

12:17.740 --> 12:20.107
while business is important,

12:20.109 --> 12:21.776
nothing is more important than us.

12:21.778 --> 12:26.247
I'm just so happy you're okay.

12:26.249 --> 12:27.948
Thank you.

12:27.950 --> 12:30.484
And yes, I completely agree.

12:30.486 --> 12:33.354
Whatever happens work-wise,

12:33.356 --> 12:34.822
we can't let that get in the way of this.

12:34.824 --> 12:37.558
No, we can't.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.693
Who says we can't divide our old business

12:39.695 --> 12:41.629
in an equitable and civil way?

12:41.631 --> 12:44.065
- Yeah.
- Right?

12:44.067 --> 12:46.300
Yeah, like a...
like a really friendly divorce.

12:46.302 --> 12:47.601
- Yeah.
- You know, where the couple

12:47.603 --> 12:49.136
- stays best friends.
- Exactly!

12:49.138 --> 12:51.739
Oh, my God, this is awesome.
This is equitable and civil?

12:51.741 --> 12:53.541
- Yeah!
- I love it. Okay.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.009
- Okay.
- Um, let's do this.

12:55.011 --> 12:56.243
- Yeah.
- Right now.

12:56.245 --> 12:57.244
- Sure.
- All right.

12:57.246 --> 13:01.182
Here we go.

13:01.184 --> 13:02.483
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:02.485 --> 13:03.784
Let's talk assets.

13:03.786 --> 13:05.419
Okay, let's talk assets.

13:05.421 --> 13:07.488
I'll take all the business clients.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.656
Only because I imagine you want

13:08.658 --> 13:10.024
to take all the individual clients.

13:10.026 --> 13:12.860
- Yeah, sure, that sounds fair.
- Good. Yes.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.962
Check, check. This is so easy it's crazy.

13:14.964 --> 13:16.630
I knew it would be. What else?

13:16.632 --> 13:18.699
I would like to keep the name "Hankmed."

13:18.701 --> 13:19.900
Huh.

13:19.902 --> 13:21.769
If that's okay.

13:21.771 --> 13:23.771
Sure.

13:23.773 --> 13:26.107
And I'd like to keep the name
"Hank," if that's okay.

13:26.109 --> 13:30.478
That is so yours. Okay, check. Wow.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.546
Uh, speaking of checks,
I'm gonna put together

13:32.548 --> 13:34.582
the nicest, fattest
severance package for you.

13:34.584 --> 13:37.785
Oh, thank you,
but that won't be necessary.

13:37.787 --> 13:42.723
[Cell phone rings]
One second.

13:42.725 --> 13:44.558
Hankmed, how can I make...

13:44.560 --> 13:47.428
y... oh, actually,
he does not work here anymore.

13:47.430 --> 13:50.231
- But how can I...
- Um...

13:50.233 --> 13:51.799
Yes. Hold on one sec.

13:51.801 --> 13:53.300
Some woman said she saw you
at Harborfest last night,

13:53.302 --> 13:54.668
that you helped her with her shoe?

13:54.670 --> 13:58.706
Right, yes, so, I guess that makes her...

13:58.708 --> 14:01.575
A pre-existing individual patient, okay.

14:01.577 --> 14:02.843
Here you go.

14:02.845 --> 14:04.678
Hello, this is Hank.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.080
Uh-huh.

14:06.082 --> 14:09.817
Okay, sure, yeah, I'll see you then.

14:09.819 --> 14:12.019
- You know what that was?
- What?

14:12.021 --> 14:13.854
That was us surviving
our first "mine or yours" call.

14:13.856 --> 14:15.156
- Yes, it was.
- Oh, my God.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.657
This is the best idea ever.

14:16.659 --> 14:18.192
[Both laugh]

14:18.194 --> 14:19.994
I'm so happy I didn't blow up last night.

14:19.996 --> 14:22.129
Yeah, me too.

14:22.131 --> 14:24.598
It is so great to see
you two back together again.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.601
Divya. Yeah. Equitable and civil.

14:27.603 --> 14:30.137
Okay.

14:30.139 --> 14:32.606
Well, I had a personal matter

14:32.608 --> 14:35.442
which kept me up so late that I overslept,

14:35.444 --> 14:39.146
so, I apologize for...
[Cell phone dings]

14:39.148 --> 14:41.815
- Did you just text me?
- Yeah.

14:41.817 --> 14:44.785
Yes, I know I'm late.
I was explaining t...

14:44.787 --> 14:47.721
[Dings]
I'm not making excuses. I...

14:47.723 --> 14:49.857
[Dings]
I am not! I... stop texting me!

14:49.859 --> 14:52.726
I told you that I had a long night.

14:52.728 --> 14:56.530
When I got your text,
I thought it was a typo.

14:56.532 --> 14:58.499
Since when do we have Hankmed meetings

14:58.501 --> 14:59.800
so early in the morning?

14:59.802 --> 15:01.335
Wait a minute, I'm sorry.

15:01.337 --> 15:03.304
You texted Divya about your staff meeting?

15:03.306 --> 15:04.672
Why wouldn't I?

15:04.674 --> 15:06.173
You guys aren't back together again.

15:06.175 --> 15:09.076
No. Well, to start,
she's my physician assistant.

15:09.078 --> 15:10.744
- I am?
- No.

15:10.746 --> 15:12.880
Divya works for Hankmed.

15:12.882 --> 15:15.115
I do?

15:15.117 --> 15:16.483
Don't you think that maybe one of you

15:16.485 --> 15:18.052
should consult me about what I want?

15:18.054 --> 15:20.454
Of... of course we should.
Of course we should. Sorry.

15:20.456 --> 15:21.622
Tell him, Divya.

15:21.624 --> 15:25.526
Yes, tell me that you work for me.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.394
Actually...

15:27.396 --> 15:32.399
I won't be working for either one of you.

15:32.401 --> 15:34.501
[Door opens, closes]

15:47.342 --> 15:50.244
Come here. Come on.

15:50.246 --> 15:52.079
Hi.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.748
Hey.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.518
Come on.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.387
Today, I'm the luckiest girl
in Easthampton.

15:59.389 --> 16:02.356
I don't even have a colorist
I've got confidence in out here,

16:02.358 --> 16:03.591
let alone a doctor.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.159
And then I find a brochure folded up

16:05.161 --> 16:06.894
in the back pocket of my shorts
with your number.

16:06.896 --> 16:08.262
Oh, you want some lemonade? It's homemade.

16:08.264 --> 16:09.296
Uh, no, thanks.

16:09.298 --> 16:11.665
- This is quite a house.
- Oh, yeah.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.868
My family and I used to
come here when I was little.

16:13.870 --> 16:15.102
Haven't been back since,

16:15.104 --> 16:16.504
but some of my favorite memories

16:16.506 --> 16:19.240
took place under this shingled roof.

16:19.242 --> 16:20.574
So, when I saw it
on the market this spring,

16:20.576 --> 16:22.810
I just snatched it up.
[Laughs]

16:22.812 --> 16:25.279
We'd spend the summers here,
all ten of us,

16:25.281 --> 16:27.515
I'm... I'm the baby.
Six brothers, one sister.

16:27.517 --> 16:29.717
They used to all kind of take care of me.

16:29.719 --> 16:31.285
- Come on, baby.
- Hey, now.

16:31.287 --> 16:33.120
But now they're just
spread across the universe.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.588
The universe?

16:34.590 --> 16:36.991
Oh, um, I have a brother who
paid to go to a space station

16:36.993 --> 16:38.225
on one of those Russian
rocket ship things.

16:38.227 --> 16:39.627
Ah.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.063
Yeah, but this is the best
place for a big family reunion,

16:42.065 --> 16:43.664
especially since we don't reunion much.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.733
But, uh, with this house,
I'm gonna change that.

16:45.735 --> 16:47.802
Everyone's coming this summer.
I can't wait.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.136
That's great.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.471
Uh, so, this whole thing is yours?

16:50.473 --> 16:52.940
Well, for now,
but I've got a lot of friends.

16:52.942 --> 16:54.542
Whoa.

16:54.544 --> 16:56.744
I was gonna rescue one,
but then I saw them all

16:56.746 --> 16:59.613
looking at me with those sad little eyes,

16:59.615 --> 17:00.681
and, I mean, I couldn't just pick one,

17:00.683 --> 17:02.783
- so, I... I took them all.
- Yes, you did.

17:02.785 --> 17:05.286
But all my friend-friends are back home.

17:05.288 --> 17:07.755
So, what seems to be the trouble?

17:07.757 --> 17:09.656
Okay, well, I've been an absolute wreck

17:09.659 --> 17:11.192
after what happened last night.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.626
Between the smoke, and the fire,

17:12.627 --> 17:14.462
and God knows what else was burning, I...

17:14.464 --> 17:16.997
I... I can't even imagine
how many toxic fumes I inhaled.

17:16.999 --> 17:20.166
Okay, well, let me take a look.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.537
No singed nasal hairs.

17:23.539 --> 17:25.205
I feel like my insides are corroding.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.108
Really? Okay. Um...

17:27.109 --> 17:30.111
[Dogs bark]

17:30.113 --> 17:31.612
Open up.

17:31.614 --> 17:33.881
- Say, "ah."
- Ahh...

17:33.883 --> 17:37.751
Okay, your throat's clear.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.386
Lean forward, please.

17:39.388 --> 17:41.755
Breathe in and out.
[Breathes]

17:41.757 --> 17:43.858
Again.
[Breathes]

17:43.860 --> 17:46.360
Well, lungs clear.

17:46.362 --> 17:49.663
And no evidence of respiratory distress.

17:49.665 --> 17:51.565
That's good news.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.334
No, I... I know you're the doctor and all,

17:53.336 --> 17:55.669
but I... I would feel a lot better
if I got a chest CT.

17:55.671 --> 17:57.471
Hollister, based on what I just saw,

17:57.473 --> 17:58.873
a CT isn't necessary.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.609
Well, people do it
all the time on <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

18:01.611 --> 18:02.943
Yes, but those people

18:02.945 --> 18:04.245
have serious, fictional medical problems.

18:04.247 --> 18:06.313
You, on the other hand, are fine.

18:06.315 --> 18:08.782
Okay, well, either I've got
something you've missed,

18:08.784 --> 18:10.217
or I've just wasted your time.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.287
That's my job. Think of me
like one of your dogs.

18:13.289 --> 18:14.889
I come when you call.

18:14.891 --> 18:16.490
Well, then you're not like my dogs at all.

18:16.492 --> 18:18.025
You don't have to leave.

18:18.027 --> 18:19.793
Um, actually, I was reading

18:19.795 --> 18:22.396
at your booth at Harborfest
about retainer clients.

18:22.398 --> 18:23.531
How does it work, exactly?

18:23.533 --> 18:25.799
Oh, right, uh, well...

18:25.801 --> 18:28.469
why don't I give you an agreement,

18:28.471 --> 18:30.204
and you can read all about it?

18:30.206 --> 18:32.506
Of course, the one thing
I don't have in my bag.

18:32.508 --> 18:33.741
Um, you know what?

18:33.743 --> 18:36.143
I'll just have my business partner person

18:36.145 --> 18:37.711
get back to you with one, okay?

18:37.713 --> 18:39.446
Uh, what's their name?

18:39.448 --> 18:42.216
Uh, I'll just drop one off myself. Okay?

18:48.924 --> 18:51.792
I'm sorry about
all the craziness with Evan,

18:51.794 --> 18:55.896
and Hankmed, and you getting
caught in the middle.

19:00.001 --> 19:01.802
Thank you for saying that.

19:01.804 --> 19:06.373
And thank you...

19:06.375 --> 19:07.741
thank you for the flowers.

19:07.743 --> 19:09.777
Wow.

19:09.779 --> 19:13.881
That's quite a... a... who gave you those?

19:13.883 --> 19:16.483
[Clears throat]
Me.

19:16.485 --> 19:18.953
Of course he did.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.255
Yours are, uh, adorable, though. Really.

19:21.257 --> 19:22.890
Thank you.

19:22.892 --> 19:24.792
It's nice to see,

19:24.794 --> 19:26.560
with everything you guys have going on,

19:26.562 --> 19:29.496
that you are thinking of me.

19:29.498 --> 19:33.367
But I have things
that I need to sort out as well.

19:33.369 --> 19:38.072
Which is what I was trying to do
until you showed up at my house.

19:38.074 --> 19:39.139
Uninvited.

19:39.141 --> 19:41.041
Right, sorry. We'll get going.

19:41.043 --> 19:45.446
Yeah. You have your own life, so...

19:47.182 --> 19:49.416
Well, we're here, um, though.

19:49.418 --> 19:52.653
We would love to figure out
the P-A of it all.

19:56.758 --> 19:57.858
I can't work for both of you.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.494
I have tried doing two jobs before,

20:00.496 --> 20:02.529
and we all know how that worked out.

20:02.531 --> 20:04.031
Yeah, but we both want to work with you.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.866
Yeah.

20:05.868 --> 20:08.202
So, you gotta pick one of us.

20:08.204 --> 20:10.104
Me or him. Or me.

20:10.106 --> 20:11.739
[Scoffs]

20:11.741 --> 20:13.741
Come on, guys.

20:13.743 --> 20:18.712
I mean, that's an impossible choice.

20:18.714 --> 20:20.681
Fine. Fine, fine.

20:20.683 --> 20:24.618
If I have to pick one...

20:24.620 --> 20:25.619
I'll need more time.

20:25.621 --> 20:26.954
Of course, of course.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.856
And look, if you want
to talk about your own stuff...

20:28.858 --> 20:31.525
I'm here. We're both here, I guess.

20:31.527 --> 20:34.328
And in the meantime,
we promise to leave you alone

20:34.330 --> 20:37.831
to make the right choice.

20:37.833 --> 20:40.567
Mm.

20:44.506 --> 20:46.006
Guys!

20:46.008 --> 20:47.441
Right, sorry.

20:47.443 --> 20:49.476
- We're on our way.
- We're on our way.

21:02.557 --> 21:06.193
Good girl.

21:09.531 --> 21:12.733
Wow. Those dogs have a nice life.

21:12.735 --> 21:15.803
They didn't always,
but they deserve one now.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.371
I'm sorry, who are you?

21:17.373 --> 21:19.239
Evan R. Lawson, CEO of Hankmed.

21:19.241 --> 21:20.374
You called. How can I help you?

21:20.376 --> 21:22.009
I... I called Hank,

21:22.011 --> 21:24.578
hoping he may have changed
his mind about a chest CT.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.013
I've been coughing.

21:26.015 --> 21:27.381
Yes, that's actually my number now.

21:27.383 --> 21:29.416
He probably changed his,

21:29.418 --> 21:31.552
but I can tell you
he does not change his mind.

21:31.554 --> 21:33.487
[Dog barks]

21:33.489 --> 21:35.589
I work for Hankmed, though.

21:35.591 --> 21:37.391
It's a different
concierge medicine business.

21:37.393 --> 21:39.526
So, there's a "Hank," and a "Hankmed"?

21:39.528 --> 21:41.495
Yes, it's a long story,

21:41.497 --> 21:45.199
but was there something not done
to make you feel better today?

21:45.201 --> 21:47.501
You know when you know something's wrong,

21:47.503 --> 21:49.036
but the people who are
supposed to know don't?

21:49.038 --> 21:52.439
You need a second opinion.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.108
Well, Hollister,

21:54.110 --> 21:56.944
you could be the healthiest
person I've seen in a long time.

21:56.946 --> 22:00.214
I was afraid you'd say that.

22:00.216 --> 22:04.084
Uh, yes, I can see why
that would be disappointing.

22:04.086 --> 22:05.686
So you can't give me a chest CT?

22:05.688 --> 22:08.589
- Well, I could, but...
- Hank...

22:08.591 --> 22:10.624
thought it was unnecessary.

22:10.626 --> 22:12.726
Yeah. Makes sense.

22:12.728 --> 22:15.462
Um, Hollister, listen,
the radiation from a chest CT

22:15.464 --> 22:18.265
may be extremely minimal,
but it does exist,

22:18.267 --> 22:19.767
and you'll likely get the same diagnosis.

22:19.769 --> 22:20.901
Also, it's very expensive.

22:20.903 --> 22:22.302
How expensive?

22:22.304 --> 22:25.372
I mean, not as expensive
as a full-body CT, of course...

22:25.374 --> 22:28.275
Wait, there's a full-body CT?

22:32.881 --> 22:36.116
I can't believe they got
this machine here so fast.

22:36.118 --> 22:38.318
Yup. Money moves mountains.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.587
Welcome to concierge medicine.

22:40.589 --> 22:44.591
Full-body CTs are awesome.
I feel better already.

22:44.593 --> 22:47.361
That's great. We're very happy for you.

22:47.363 --> 22:50.664
Only this isn't a treatment,
it's a diagnostic tool.

22:50.666 --> 22:52.833
Well, whatever it is, it's working.

22:52.835 --> 22:54.902
Good.

22:54.904 --> 22:55.903
How is it working?

22:55.905 --> 22:58.839
It's not.

22:58.841 --> 23:00.607
So, she's... she's crazy?

23:00.609 --> 23:04.211
She wouldn't be the first
person to be cured by a test.

23:04.213 --> 23:05.612
Sometimes patients

23:05.614 --> 23:08.248
just need to feel like
the doctor's doing something.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.384
Placebo effect.

23:14.756 --> 23:16.557
So, Ernie, how is it having Luke back?

23:16.559 --> 23:18.559
Considering I didn't
want him in chess camp

23:18.561 --> 23:20.961
in the first place, I'd say
I'm taking it pretty well.

23:20.963 --> 23:23.163
Well, we know you're
taking that part well.

23:23.165 --> 23:24.498
- What about the other part?
- Oh.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.134
When I called the camp
to find out what happened,

23:27.136 --> 23:28.535
I got a little surprise.

23:28.537 --> 23:31.472
Guess who didn't get kicked out.

23:31.474 --> 23:32.773
Turns out he ran away.

23:32.775 --> 23:33.774
Really?

23:33.776 --> 23:35.175
Did... did Luke say why?

23:35.177 --> 23:37.110
Yeah, he wouldn't
talk about it with Ernie or me.

23:37.112 --> 23:38.979
Kid never tells me anything.

23:38.981 --> 23:40.147
Well, I need to give Luke
his test results.

23:40.149 --> 23:41.315
Maybe he'll talk to me.

23:41.317 --> 23:43.183
Yeah, good luck with that.

23:43.185 --> 23:44.184
And the results?

23:44.186 --> 23:46.053
Everything's normal.

23:46.055 --> 23:47.654
Good. Good.

23:47.656 --> 23:49.790
Well, I guess I'm done here. Thanks, doc.

23:49.792 --> 23:51.859
And I will, uh, see you guys later.

23:51.861 --> 23:53.794
- Okay.
- Bye, Ernie.

23:53.796 --> 23:55.128
[Sighs]

23:55.130 --> 23:58.165
I am so relieved to hear
that Luke's test came back okay.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.200
- Yeah.
- I wish...

24:00.202 --> 24:02.736
I could give your business
the same clean bill of health.

24:02.738 --> 24:04.838
I thought you were gonna
get me a new business number,

24:04.840 --> 24:05.873
some interviews...

24:05.875 --> 24:08.876
Well, I did, but Hank,

24:08.878 --> 24:10.511
I've also been going through the books,

24:10.513 --> 24:14.047
and you have bigger problems
than staffing.

24:14.049 --> 24:15.849
If you don't get some capital soon,

24:15.851 --> 24:17.918
you're not gonna be hiring anyone.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.753
It's that bad?

24:19.755 --> 24:23.657
Well, Hank, remember, you're
building a brand-new business.

24:23.659 --> 24:25.692
You have to buy your own equipment,

24:25.694 --> 24:28.061
build an infrastructure...

24:28.063 --> 24:29.730
You need a steady flow of new patients

24:29.732 --> 24:32.132
like Evan used to bring in.

24:32.134 --> 24:34.935
Your new business has no money.

24:37.772 --> 24:39.773
Okay.

24:41.622 --> 24:43.122
You can do this.

24:43.124 --> 24:44.724
You can do this.
[Phone beeps]

24:44.726 --> 24:48.794
Hi, this is Hank. Well, Dr. Lawson.

24:48.796 --> 24:52.798
Dr. Hank Lawson.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.867
I... I... I... I... I...

24:54.869 --> 24:56.636
I have a new phone number. Yes, I do.

24:56.638 --> 24:59.305
And, uh, when... when you get this message,

24:59.307 --> 25:01.874
you can... you can just call me
back on that new phone number

25:01.876 --> 25:04.343
because...

25:04.345 --> 25:08.080
because I have some exciting new programs.

25:08.082 --> 25:10.316
They're exciting, and they're new,

25:10.318 --> 25:12.351
and you are gonna wanna hear about 'em

25:12.353 --> 25:15.922
so much that you're gonna call
me back to find out about them.

25:15.924 --> 25:17.089
[Knock on door]

25:17.091 --> 25:19.325
Uh, so, that...
that new phone number is 6...

25:19.327 --> 25:22.295
[voicemail beeps]

25:22.297 --> 25:23.262
Yes.

25:23.264 --> 25:25.064
10:00 sounds great.

25:25.066 --> 25:27.033
Yeah. No, no, we're gonna
leave a little extra time,

25:27.035 --> 25:29.202
since you're my new patient.

25:29.204 --> 25:31.671
My pleasure.

25:31.673 --> 25:34.473
Good morning, doctor.

25:34.475 --> 25:36.976
Hi, Evan.

25:36.978 --> 25:38.578
Come on in.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.647
[Clears throat]
Here you go.

25:41.649 --> 25:43.316
Th... no, no, no.

25:43.318 --> 25:45.184
These are... these are your copies

25:45.186 --> 25:46.319
of the corporate retainer client files.

25:46.321 --> 25:47.286
Oh, I got 'em.

25:47.288 --> 25:49.021
You...

25:49.023 --> 25:50.489
memorized all the files?

25:50.491 --> 25:51.991
Yes.

25:51.993 --> 25:54.260
So, if I asked you

25:54.262 --> 25:57.029
which patient had a tuberculosis scare,

25:57.031 --> 25:58.097
but it turned out to just be a rash...

25:58.099 --> 26:00.766
987-67-2104.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.435
What?

26:02.437 --> 26:04.337
I memorized the patients'
social security numbers.

26:04.339 --> 26:07.106
See, there are a lot of Johns
and Davids and Marys,

26:07.108 --> 26:09.875
but each one of them has
their own unique identifiers.

26:09.877 --> 26:11.277
Right.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.511
But they're not gonna want to be called

26:12.513 --> 26:15.514
by their own unique identifier.

26:15.516 --> 26:19.285
They're... they're gonna want to
be called John, David, or Mary.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.354
I see.

26:21.356 --> 26:24.223
In that case, this will take more time.

26:24.225 --> 26:27.293
Yeah, well, you really
don't have to memorize...

26:31.565 --> 26:33.599
Hey. How's it going?

26:33.601 --> 26:36.369
Good. Just breaking in the new staff.

26:36.371 --> 26:40.072
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
That is some doctor you hired.

26:40.074 --> 26:41.374
[Chuckles]
Okay.

26:41.376 --> 26:42.942
The man's new to concierge medicine.

26:42.944 --> 26:44.877
He will get his sea legs.

26:44.879 --> 26:46.379
He needs a little time, that's all.

26:46.381 --> 26:48.047
No, no, I wasn't criticizing him.

26:48.049 --> 26:49.248
I looked Dr. Sacani up online.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.916
I wanted to make sure he was legit.

26:50.918 --> 26:52.351
Top of his class at Johns Hopkins.

26:52.353 --> 26:53.953
Johns Hopkins, yeah.

26:53.955 --> 26:55.554
Published a groundbreaking study

26:55.556 --> 26:57.223
- in <i>The New England Journal.</i>
- Groundbreaking.

26:57.225 --> 26:58.591
His resume's impressive.

26:58.593 --> 27:01.594
His resume is impressive. That's right.

27:01.596 --> 27:06.565
Can't wait for our patients
to meet his resume.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.974
Your eye's gotten a little
more black and blue,

27:14.976 --> 27:17.810
but that's normal.

27:17.812 --> 27:20.546
Okay, Hank, it is really
hard to see the board

27:20.548 --> 27:22.014
with that thing in my eye.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.416
Oh, I'm so sorry my exam

27:23.418 --> 27:25.117
is interfering with your chess game.

27:25.119 --> 27:27.353
I'm done. Now, how 'bout
you tell me what happened?

27:27.355 --> 27:31.090
- Oh, I nabbed your bishop.
- Thanks. I meant at camp.

27:31.092 --> 27:32.458
It's your move.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.860
Luke, your aunt's worried about you.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.195
And so am I.

27:36.197 --> 27:39.398
Okay.

27:39.400 --> 27:43.502
[Chuckles, snorts]

27:43.504 --> 27:45.604
Okay. There was this girl.

27:45.606 --> 27:48.007
Last month, she asked me
to take the SATs for her.

27:48.009 --> 27:49.308
You know that's illegal.

27:49.310 --> 27:52.378
Yes, officer. Your move.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.713
[Snorts]

27:53.715 --> 27:55.281
How'd you even take them for a girl?

27:55.283 --> 27:57.817
Her name is Alex.

27:57.819 --> 28:00.186
But the day of the test,
I wanted to back out.

28:00.188 --> 28:03.322
- I got really nervous.
- Hm.

28:03.324 --> 28:07.493
But then Alex convinced me to do it.

28:07.495 --> 28:08.494
She did? How?

28:08.496 --> 28:10.129
So, I took it.

28:10.131 --> 28:11.430
But during the test,

28:11.432 --> 28:12.932
my mind went blank; I forgot everything.

28:12.934 --> 28:15.267
Must've been the nerves.
Totally screwed up.

28:15.269 --> 28:19.605
And when Alex got her scores,
she was pissed.

28:19.607 --> 28:22.808
She cornered me at chess camp,
and well, uh...

28:22.810 --> 28:24.243
bam.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.678
[Snorts]
[Blood pressure pump hisses]

28:25.680 --> 28:27.613
You said that when you took
the test for the girl,

28:27.615 --> 28:28.681
you were really nervous,

28:28.683 --> 28:30.316
do you get nervous a lot?

28:30.318 --> 28:32.084
No, not usually. I also
don't usually break the law.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.352
Your move.

28:33.354 --> 28:35.121
You seem really nervous right now.

28:35.123 --> 28:36.222
[Snorts]

28:36.224 --> 28:38.991
And your blood pressure's high.

28:38.993 --> 28:41.093
For a kid your age, that's unusual.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.161
I'm gonna take some blood.

28:42.163 --> 28:44.497
[Computer dings]
Your move.

28:44.499 --> 28:46.932
Luke, I want to make sure
your kidney function's normal.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.935
- Okay, but...
- I know, okay? My move.

28:52.005 --> 28:53.639
She just said, "symptoms."

28:53.641 --> 28:55.307
She didn't say what they were.

28:55.309 --> 28:57.176
Well, isn't that why we're here?

28:57.178 --> 28:58.811
To find out?

28:58.813 --> 29:02.214
You don't think Hankmed 2.0 did something

29:02.216 --> 29:04.483
that, uh, made her sick, do you?

29:04.485 --> 29:09.555
Don't know. What did Hankmed 2.0 do?

29:09.557 --> 29:11.991
So she wanted a chest CT.

29:11.993 --> 29:14.026
Okay? Hank refused,

29:14.028 --> 29:15.327
but then we did it.

29:15.329 --> 29:17.663
Actually, we gave her a full-body CT.

29:17.665 --> 29:19.965
And now she's sick.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.368
I doubt a CT made her sick.

29:22.370 --> 29:23.969
[Exhales]

29:23.971 --> 29:25.838
But I can't say anything for sure

29:25.840 --> 29:27.573
- until I've seen the patient.
- Good.

29:27.575 --> 29:32.445
This isn't an emergency, is it?

29:32.447 --> 29:34.046
Technically, no.

29:34.048 --> 29:37.349
- But it's...
- Evan.

29:37.351 --> 29:39.018
I don't appreciate you doing this to me

29:39.020 --> 29:40.920
when you said you'd give me time.

29:40.922 --> 29:42.221
I know, Divya, I'm sorry.

29:42.223 --> 29:45.057
I... I... Hank said no, Van Dyke said yes,

29:45.059 --> 29:46.759
I didn't know what to think.

29:46.761 --> 29:48.160
I needed another opinion
from someone I trust.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.862
And it's just this one patient.

29:49.864 --> 29:52.865
I promise you I'm not gonna
talk about business at all.

29:52.867 --> 29:54.633
Unless, of course, you've decided

29:54.635 --> 29:58.804
you do want to work for me,
at which point we can talk...

30:02.242 --> 30:04.610
So, tell me what's going on.

30:04.612 --> 30:06.512
Um...

30:06.514 --> 30:09.949
nausea... bad, stomach-turning,

30:09.951 --> 30:12.751
thought-of-food-makes-me-sick nausea.

30:12.753 --> 30:15.154
I was throwing up all night,
and I was alone,

30:15.156 --> 30:16.288
so it was really scary.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.123
I could imagine.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.960
The radiologist confirms
that your CT is clean.

30:20.962 --> 30:25.164
Um, okay, well, the thing is I was there

30:25.166 --> 30:27.733
during the explosions with the smoke...

30:27.735 --> 30:29.502
Oh, Hollister, Divya has your history.

30:29.504 --> 30:32.271
It was just the other doctors asked.

30:32.273 --> 30:33.839
I'm sorry that you had to

30:33.841 --> 30:36.242
describe your symptoms
to three different people.

30:36.244 --> 30:38.811
You should have more
continuity of care than that.

30:38.813 --> 30:42.515
I don't mind repeating myself.

30:42.517 --> 30:45.784
Actually, it's really nice
to have company.

30:45.786 --> 30:48.587
My family was supposed to come
visit for Memorial Day weekend.

30:48.589 --> 30:52.558
A big reunion, but, uh,
they couldn't make it.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.294
Some of my siblings are still
trying to visit, though.

30:55.296 --> 30:58.697
Busy lives.

30:58.699 --> 31:01.166
Divya, hey.

31:01.168 --> 31:03.903
Look...
[Sighs]

31:03.905 --> 31:06.071
I get it.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.274
You're caught in the middle.

31:08.276 --> 31:11.510
It's not fair to you.

31:11.512 --> 31:15.047
And I'm sorry.

31:15.049 --> 31:16.782
I really am.

31:16.784 --> 31:19.685
Thank you, Evan.

31:19.687 --> 31:21.320
[Sighs]

31:21.322 --> 31:23.155
You've got to understand.

31:23.157 --> 31:25.324
You and Hank are family.

31:25.326 --> 31:28.794
You're the only family I have right now.

31:28.796 --> 31:31.630
And I can't do anything to mess that up.

31:31.632 --> 31:34.033
I lost one family; I won't lose another.

31:34.035 --> 31:37.736
I understand.

31:37.738 --> 31:41.073
And you're family to me too.

31:41.075 --> 31:45.811
Which is a giant part of why
I can't do this without you.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.117
[Knock on door]

31:52.119 --> 31:54.753
Jill, it's me.

31:54.755 --> 31:57.323
Luke broke into my house,
and he's acting really strange.

31:57.325 --> 31:59.158
I need you to help me
get him to the hospital.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.759
He won't listen to me.

32:00.761 --> 32:02.227
I didn't know it was her, Hank,

32:02.229 --> 32:02.962
I totally thought
somebody was breaking in.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.063
Someone did.

32:04.065 --> 32:05.531
I didn't want you to get robbed.

32:05.533 --> 32:07.499
There have been a lot
of robberies around here,

32:07.501 --> 32:08.667
- right, aunt Jill?
- Yes, Luke,

32:08.669 --> 32:10.135
there have been, but...

32:10.137 --> 32:12.771
What were you doing here in the
first place, and not at home?

32:12.773 --> 32:15.174
It's not safe there. There are
so many noises and lights.

32:15.176 --> 32:16.875
[Computer dings]

32:16.877 --> 32:19.178
Okay. What's wrong with him?

32:19.180 --> 32:22.114
I think he's become hypervigilant.

32:30.256 --> 32:32.091
Luke, you're burning up.

32:32.093 --> 32:33.859
I'd like to take your temperature.

32:33.861 --> 32:34.960
I'm hot because the damn computer

32:34.962 --> 32:36.829
has got rook and pawn versus rook.

32:36.831 --> 32:38.364
And it's really hot in here.

32:38.366 --> 32:40.265
Okay, come here.

[Beeping]

32:43.638 --> 32:44.970
Okay, forget the game.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.405
We have to get you to the hospital.

32:46.407 --> 32:47.272
No way, not until I finish this.

32:47.274 --> 32:48.240
I should've won five moves ago.

32:48.242 --> 32:51.810
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

32:54.447 --> 32:55.881
Luke!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.917
- Luke, forget about the game.
- What game?

33:07.919 --> 33:10.887
Chess. Luke, you don't remember?

33:10.889 --> 33:15.058
Aunt Jill, my mind... is blank.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.562
Luke, try to remember.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.397
Is it the same kind of blank that you felt

33:21.399 --> 33:22.799
when you took the SATs?

33:22.801 --> 33:25.368
I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

33:25.370 --> 33:26.503
You were nervous then,

33:26.505 --> 33:27.770
and you were nervous about going to camp.

33:27.772 --> 33:28.905
Did you take anything?

33:28.907 --> 33:31.307
The girl, Alex, who convinced you,

33:31.309 --> 33:33.576
did she give you something
to calm your nerves?

33:33.578 --> 33:38.214
Yeah, maybe Alex gave me some
of her mom's antidepressants.

33:38.216 --> 33:41.284
How long ago did you
take your cold medication?

33:41.286 --> 33:43.453
I don't know.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.321
Over an hour.

33:45.323 --> 33:46.523
Okay, we need to try to stop the effect

33:46.525 --> 33:47.790
of the cold medicine in his system.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.325
I've called 911. They're on their way.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.995
If we don't get it out of his body now...

What?

33:53.398 --> 33:55.732
Here.

33:55.734 --> 33:59.102
Rip this up into thin strips, okay?

34:09.246 --> 34:11.481
Okay.

Antidepressants will stay
in his system for weeks.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.018
[Groans, gags]
Sorry, Luke.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.587
If I'm right,
the combination of those pills

34:17.589 --> 34:18.855
with the cold medicine he just took

34:18.857 --> 34:20.690
set off a serotonin storm in his body.

34:20.692 --> 34:24.127
It explains the fever,
agitation, hypervigilance...

34:24.129 --> 34:26.429
- And his elevated BP.
- Exactly.

34:26.431 --> 34:30.934
- Can I have the charcoal, please?
- Yeah.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.735
That latest dose of cold medicine

34:32.737 --> 34:34.103
was the gasoline on the fire,

34:34.105 --> 34:35.371
so, we've got to get the charcoal in

34:35.373 --> 34:37.306
to get the gasoline out.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.475
Come on, Luke. Stay with us, bud.

There was no obstruction.

I didn't give her a CT, did you?

Oh. Well, now she actually needs one.

Here, you can see there's fat stranding.

36:00.725 --> 36:02.091
It's most likely caused

36:02.093 --> 36:03.693
from Hollister being near the explosion.

that the concussive force
of the propane explosion

to damage a hollow organ.

was Hollister's small intestine.

Mm-hmm.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.486
The pressure of the blast probably damaged

38:48.488 --> 38:49.854
several vessels in the bowel,

38:49.856 --> 38:51.522
which led to edema and tissue breakdown.

It's called shock bowel.

39:49.315 --> 39:50.448
Right, whoever you'd like to call,

39:50.450 --> 39:51.783
we'll respect the decision.

39:51.785 --> 39:53.317
Exactly, your health is obviously

39:53.319 --> 39:54.919
- the most important thing here.
- Most important thing.

39:54.921 --> 39:57.722
- As well as your dogs.
- Guys.

39:57.724 --> 39:59.090
Really? Really?

39:59.092 --> 40:00.792
It's okay. I already know who I'm hiring.

40:00.794 --> 40:02.360
Hank and Evan: You do?

40:02.362 --> 40:04.162
I'm retaining you both.

40:04.164 --> 40:06.330
Uh, look, two...

40:06.332 --> 40:08.533
two concierge doctors
kinda sounds like one too many.

40:08.535 --> 40:09.801
Yeah.

40:09.803 --> 40:12.704
Well, how could I possibly choose?

40:12.706 --> 40:14.572
Besides, they always say
to get a second opinion,

40:14.574 --> 40:16.441
and with the both of you, I always can.

40:16.443 --> 40:20.044
- Hollister?
- Julie?

40:20.046 --> 40:22.714
We came the second we got the call.

40:22.716 --> 40:24.449
Oh...

40:24.451 --> 40:26.884
What did the doctor say you have?

40:26.886 --> 40:28.653
Let's just call it...

40:28.655 --> 40:29.987
"ew."
[Laughs]

40:29.989 --> 40:31.255
Hi.

40:31.257 --> 40:32.857
Sorry to interrupt,

40:32.859 --> 40:35.593
but we have got a thing
that we have to go and do.

40:35.595 --> 40:36.661
- We have that thing with the...
- That thing.

40:36.663 --> 40:38.329
Thank you, guys.

40:38.331 --> 40:39.997
- Bye, Hollister.
- Buh-bye.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.733
How have you been?

40:41.735 --> 40:43.534
- I haven't seen you...
- Excuse me.

40:43.536 --> 40:46.137
Hankmed 2.0. Just remember.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.338
- Evan.
- Got it.

40:47.340 --> 40:50.141
[Giggles]
Sorry about that.

40:50.143 --> 40:51.743
God.

40:51.745 --> 40:54.512
You'd think she would've had
the decency to pick one of us.

40:54.514 --> 40:56.247
Actually, I think it's kind of inspired.

40:56.249 --> 40:59.749
I mean, why pick one Lawson
if you don't have to?

41:02.674 --> 41:07.174
Are you... are you saying
what I fear you're saying?

41:07.199 --> 41:11.099
Gentlemen. I have decided
that I am going to work

41:11.124 --> 41:13.424
for both of you.

41:13.449 --> 41:17.149
But, 50-50, down the middle.

41:17.174 --> 41:20.874
I'll drop off a master schedule for
both of you to follow in the morning.

41:20.899 --> 41:22.099
Until then.

41:22.124 --> 41:23.824
But Div...

41:24.349 --> 41:27.249
- That's not a choice.
- That's not a choice!
