00:05.806 --> 00:07.666
Sup?

00:08.363 --> 00:10.644
It's 90° out.

00:10.645 --> 00:13.714
Why are you wearing
all that wool?

00:13.715 --> 00:17.009
This isn't wool. It's
genuine Alpaca Fleece.

00:17.010 --> 00:21.090
My cousin has an Alpaca farm.
Feel.

00:23.086 --> 00:24.622
Oh.

00:24.623 --> 00:27.023
Ooh, fluffy.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.448
Trish, you've got
to feel Dez's coat.

00:30.449 --> 00:35.789
It's like if a cloud and
a Teddy Bear had a baby.

00:36.444 --> 00:39.506
Touch Dez? Eh, no thanks.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.980
Anyway, Ally, I've
got some big news.

00:41.981 --> 00:44.478
Jimmy Starr wants
to meet with you.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.613
Why? I thought he
didn't want to sign me?

00:46.614 --> 00:48.494
Well, I sent him your new song.

00:48.495 --> 00:51.712
He just called and said he
loved it and wants to talk.

00:51.713 --> 00:54.755
He must have changed his mind. I bet
he wants to give you a record deal.

00:54.756 --> 00:58.123
Trish, I can't believe it.
Thank you so much.

00:58.124 --> 01:01.362
Just make sure you submit me for
the Manager of the Year Award.

01:01.363 --> 01:03.436
Here's the application.

01:03.437 --> 01:07.402
Actually, I already filled it out.
It just needs a stamp.

01:07.403 --> 01:11.783
I'm so happy for you, Ally.
Group hug.

01:12.816 --> 01:18.636
Okay, this must be soft, because
I'm actually touching Dez.

01:19.261 --> 01:21.481

Ally, I love the new song.

02:16.494 --> 02:18.362
I'm so happy Trish
sent it to me.

02:18.363 --> 02:19.563
I don't know if you heard.

02:19.564 --> 02:21.632
I'm being nominated for
Manager of the Year.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.196
Well, I can see why.

02:23.197 --> 02:27.738
You sent me a hit song, and I want
my newest female artist to sing it.

02:27.739 --> 02:29.506
Thank you, Jimmy.

02:29.507 --> 02:31.675
This is so unexpected.

02:31.676 --> 02:33.577
I don't know what to say.

02:33.578 --> 02:34.977
But just off the top of my head,

02:34.978 --> 02:37.860
I'd like to thank my manager and my
parents who have always been there...

02:37.861 --> 02:41.635
And here's my newest artist now.

02:41.636 --> 02:43.729
- Wait, what?
- Hi, daddy.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.298
Hang on. Kira's your new artist?

02:46.299 --> 02:47.663
Yep. I'm a singer now.

02:47.664 --> 02:51.564
<i>♪ And I got signed by my daddy.</i>

02:52.497 --> 02:55.842
Ally, I want to buy your
song for Kira to sing.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.370
So you're not offering
me a record deal?

02:59.371 --> 03:01.412
Look, Ally, you're
very talented.

03:01.413 --> 03:03.616
But I still don't think it's
a good idea to have Austin,

03:03.617 --> 03:07.548
and his songwriter
on the same label.

03:07.549 --> 03:11.986
Jimmy, I'm glad you like the song,
but I can't sell it to you.

03:11.987 --> 03:15.210
This isn't about you and me both dating
Austin and all that drama, is it?

03:15.211 --> 03:17.488
No. That's not it at all.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.831
The song is called "Finally Me".

03:19.832 --> 03:22.047
It's about...

03:22.048 --> 03:23.836
Me.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.563
I know what this
is really about...

03:26.564 --> 03:28.182
Money.

03:28.183 --> 03:29.333
Tell you what.

03:29.334 --> 03:34.914
I'm going to write a number
down on a piece of paper.

03:35.259 --> 03:37.092
Take a look.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.158
I don't want to take a look.

03:39.159 --> 03:41.478
Just take a look.

03:41.479 --> 03:44.153
I don't want to take a look.

03:44.154 --> 03:46.717
- Just take...
- I'll take a look.

03:46.718 --> 03:48.685
Oh, whoa.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.769
That's a lot of numbers. Deal.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.218
Sorry. I'm not selling the song.

03:53.219 --> 03:56.693
It's too personal and I
want to sing it myself.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.334
Come on, Trish.

04:06.604 --> 04:11.790
Check it out. I made Ally a singing card to
celebrate her signing with Starr Records.

04:11.791 --> 04:14.311
Quick, call the party off
and dump the decorations.

if you had actually got...

04:55.487 --> 04:57.688
Never mind.

04:57.689 --> 05:00.896
Why would Jimmy want to meet with
you if he didn't want to sign you?

05:00.897 --> 05:03.293
He wanted to buy my new song...

05:03.294 --> 05:04.328
For Kira.

She's Starr Records'
newest recording artist.

Yeah.

05:15.988 --> 05:20.171
A lot of other labels were interested in
you after the last time you performed.

05:20.172 --> 05:21.775
Thanks, guys.

05:21.776 --> 05:23.765
And hey, I still have my song.

05:23.766 --> 05:25.665
I'm glad you didn't
give it to Jimmy.

05:25.666 --> 05:28.223
You're the only one
who should sing it.

05:28.224 --> 05:31.688
We're supposed to check out Jimmy's
new recording studio tomorrow.

05:31.689 --> 05:33.763
I just hope it won't be awkward.

05:33.764 --> 05:34.990
Why would it be awkward?

05:34.991 --> 05:39.311
Yeah, if anything
it'll be humiliating.

- It's so cool.

06:11.462 --> 06:13.107
Kira, you sounded great.

06:13.108 --> 06:15.708
Thanks, Austin. That means
a lot coming from you.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.467
Maybe we can work
together some day.

06:17.468 --> 06:21.982
Maybe. I was really hoping
I'd get to work with Ally.

06:21.983 --> 06:26.376
I'd really like to sing that song
Ally wrote at my gig tomorrow night.

06:26.377 --> 06:28.187

I wish I just had that one great song
to really put it over the top, Ally.

06:32.349 --> 06:35.318
A song that's already
been written.

06:35.319 --> 06:37.239
Ally.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.847
Yeah, I'm not gonna
sell you my song.

06:40.848 --> 06:43.185
Ally, I hope there are
no hard feelings.

06:43.186 --> 06:45.820
I know you were hoping for
a record deal yesterday.

06:45.821 --> 06:49.499
And she's gonna get one, because
a lot of people are interested.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.434
You're gonna regret
not signing her.

06:51.435 --> 06:56.358
Just like you're gonna regret putting a
"help yourself" sign on the mini-fridge.

06:56.359 --> 07:00.343
Guys, look what I got.
Mini-fridge. Woo!

07:00.344 --> 07:02.629
- Told you.
- You might be right, Trish.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.014

the fridge back where it belongs.

Jimmy's okay with this?

- Jimmy's gonna be back any minute.
- This is terrible.

08:48.193 --> 08:52.127

because he didn't give me a record deal.

and it'll take the blame off of us.

Yeah, we've got everything...
a juice bar, a yoga studio,

09:05.777 --> 09:08.011
and the sound
quality is amazing.

09:08.012 --> 09:09.880
Let me show you. I'll
play Kira's track.

09:09.881 --> 09:11.663
- That's okay.
- I don't like music.

09:11.664 --> 09:14.084

- But your wife called.

09:14.085 --> 09:17.159

go home right away.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.383
- Why?
- Uh...

- Yeah.

09:21.336 --> 09:23.048
We don't have a dog.

09:23.049 --> 09:25.509
She got one.

09:25.968 --> 09:30.468
That woman. We already
talked about this.

09:31.903 --> 09:36.216
We have to find a way to replace
Kira's track before Jimmy hears it.

09:36.217 --> 09:39.809
Didn't Jimmy say there's
a yoga studio in here?

09:39.810 --> 09:43.484
I know this sounds weird, but
Kira sings when she does yoga.

09:43.485 --> 09:47.574
Great. So all we have to do is figure
out when she's in the yoga studio,

09:47.575 --> 09:50.058
hope she sings the
song we erased...

09:50.059 --> 09:52.055
And somehow record it.

09:52.056 --> 09:53.957
Exactly!

09:53.958 --> 09:58.756
Let's go get our yoga clothes on. Trish,
you stay here in case Jimmy comes back.

09:58.757 --> 10:02.198
All right. These microphones
should pick up Kira's singing.

10:02.199 --> 10:04.774

10:04.775 --> 10:07.237
Kira. Crazy running
into you here.

10:07.238 --> 10:10.173

yoga from 2:15 to 3:45

10:10.174 --> 10:13.818
every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

10:13.819 --> 10:15.474

10:15.475 --> 10:17.797
Oh, your dad said we could
use the yoga studio.

10:17.798 --> 10:21.038

10:22.220 --> 10:23.788

10:23.789 --> 10:26.349

hated going to yoga with me.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.349

We just like to make up our
own names for our poses.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.893
We also like to sing
while we do yoga.

11:02.894 --> 11:04.094
Very subtle.

11:04.095 --> 11:08.294
Me too! But I usually only do that
when I'm in a really painful pose.

11:08.295 --> 11:10.100
It helps me stay focused.

11:10.101 --> 11:12.441
Interesting.

11:12.449 --> 11:14.524
Can you stay focused
doing this pose?

11:14.525 --> 11:19.505
I call it "the downward
dog near fire hydrant".

11:21.212 --> 11:25.652

Oh.

11:32.256 --> 11:38.156
Now let's do the "lift your leg
till it hurts real bad" pose.

11:38.977 --> 11:41.251
I bet you can't go higher.

11:41.252 --> 11:43.412
Oh yeah?

11:46.304 --> 11:48.344
Higher.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.600
That's it. Now sing
through the pain.

11:51.601 --> 11:54.244
Preferably your newest song.

11:54.245 --> 11:58.307
<i>♪ Home alone, got my phone
hear your ring tone...</i>

11:58.308 --> 12:00.951
- Can we stop now?
- No! We're not quitters.

12:00.952 --> 12:03.410
I want to be a quitter!

12:03.411 --> 12:05.277
<i>♪ Read your text.</i>

12:05.278 --> 12:09.126
<i>♪ Don't know why
you're so perplexed.</i>

12:09.127 --> 12:12.333
Hey, where's Trish? It was her
job to look out for Jimmy.

12:12.334 --> 12:16.234
Trish not doing her job?
Shocker.

12:16.775 --> 12:20.267
Okay. We got Kira's new
vocal track on my laptop.

12:20.268 --> 12:22.940
I can't believe this is
actually gonna work.

12:22.941 --> 12:26.043
I can't believe Kira's
leg didn't break off.

12:26.044 --> 12:29.079
Before we transfer it,
let's hear what we got.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.656
<i>♪ Home alone, got my phone
hear your ring tone.</i>

12:32.657 --> 12:35.318
Okay. We got Kira's new
vocal track on my laptop.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.816
I can't believe this is
actually gonna work.

12:37.817 --> 12:39.983
I can't believe Kira's
leg didn't break off.

12:39.984 --> 12:41.928
Oh, I see what happened.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.625
I accidentally taped over
the new track we recorded.

12:44.626 --> 12:47.626
- Crazy, huh?
- Dez!

12:48.511 --> 12:50.467
Jimmy!

12:50.468 --> 12:52.768
I see you guys checked
out the yoga studio.

12:52.769 --> 12:56.006
- What are you doing back here?
- I just came back to mix Kira's song.

12:56.007 --> 12:57.905
Now you can finally hear it.

12:57.906 --> 12:59.910
- No.
- No thanks.

12:59.911 --> 13:03.981
<i>♪ Home alone got my phone,
hear your ring tone...</i>

13:03.982 --> 13:08.002
For the Miami
Marlins, Austin Moon!

13:09.955 --> 13:15.115
And the Manager of the
Year is Trish De La Rosa!

13:15.172 --> 13:18.585
<i>♪ Don't you know I got
that rock and roll...</i>

13:18.586 --> 13:21.332
<i>♪ On the same shores.</i>

13:21.333 --> 13:23.067
<i>♪ Elevator doors.</i>

13:23.068 --> 13:26.664
Austin Monica Moon,
get back here.

13:26.665 --> 13:28.886
Does everyone know
my middle name?

13:28.887 --> 13:32.175
I can't believe you, Austin! Trying
to sabotage my daughter's career.

13:32.176 --> 13:35.012
Jimmy, that's not what happened.
It was an accident.

13:35.013 --> 13:39.115
It was an accident you ruined her
song the day after I didn't sign you?

13:39.116 --> 13:43.540
Exactly. I'm so glad we cleared
up this misunderstanding.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.055
Look Jimmy, don't blame Ally.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.828
Oh, I won't. I'll blame you.

13:47.829 --> 13:51.996
First you break my daughter's heart, now
you purposely ruin her first single.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.905
You leave me with no choice.

13:53.906 --> 13:55.705
But to forgive me?

13:55.706 --> 13:56.967
No.

13:56.968 --> 14:00.838
To release you from
your contract.

14:00.839 --> 14:06.387
As of this moment, you are no longer
a Starr Records recording artist.

14:06.388 --> 14:12.148
Did you guys know there's a
basketball court on the roof?

14:12.978 --> 14:15.318
Think fast.

14:22.887 --> 14:24.663
How's Austin doing?

14:24.664 --> 14:28.304
He's learning how to become an electrician.
Something about needing a new career.

14:28.305 --> 14:30.306
He can't become an electrician.

14:30.307 --> 14:35.467
You're telling me. Look
what he did to my radio.

14:38.515 --> 14:42.452
Did you know that electricity travels
at 186,000 miles per second?

14:42.453 --> 14:45.342
- Of course.
- Don't care.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.178
Look, sure this is
a setback but...

14:48.179 --> 14:49.863
That doesn't mean
you should give up.

14:49.864 --> 14:51.706
I'm not giving up.

14:51.707 --> 14:54.096
I'm gonna figure out a
way to get you resigned.

14:54.097 --> 14:56.566
We should bribe him...
with cash!

14:56.567 --> 14:59.087
Or an Alpaca!

14:59.719 --> 15:02.317
- Neither of those will work.
- Why?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.541
Because he's rich
and not an idiot.

15:05.542 --> 15:09.212
Well, if that doesn't work, I have my
career as an electrician to fall back on.

15:09.213 --> 15:12.993
Check out this toaster I fixed.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.320
Trish, you've got one minute.

15:22.321 --> 15:26.870
Jimmy, I just wanted to thank you for
dropping Austin from Starr Records.

15:26.871 --> 15:29.924
- Thank me?
- Oh yeah.

15:29.925 --> 15:34.444
Austin's got so many other offers
from other record labels now.

15:34.445 --> 15:37.819
But before he signs with one,
I figured I'd come down here

15:37.820 --> 15:43.589
and give you a chance to admit this was
all a misunderstanding and take him back.

15:43.590 --> 15:48.158
I don't think this was a misunderstanding
and I'm not taking him back.

15:48.159 --> 15:50.439
All right.

15:51.162 --> 15:54.239
But, when I walk
out that door...

15:54.240 --> 15:57.720
The deal is off the table.

15:58.527 --> 16:00.867
Here I go.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.208
Walking to the door.

16:07.378 --> 16:10.738
Got my hand on the knob.

16:11.603 --> 16:14.994
Okay, I was bluffing! You
gotta take Austin back.

16:14.995 --> 16:16.637
- Can I bribe you?
- No.

16:16.638 --> 16:20.209
- Why not?
- Because I'm rich and not an idiot.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.549
- Look, Austin is very talented...
- So talented.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.563
- And I appreciate your loyalty to him...
- So loyal.

16:26.564 --> 16:28.838
But he ruined Kira's
track out of spite.

16:28.839 --> 16:32.104
I can't work with someone
that has so little character.

16:32.105 --> 16:36.005
Would an Alpaca
change your mind?

16:43.966 --> 16:45.886
Kira.

16:46.236 --> 16:49.331
Ally, what are you doing here?
I'm about to go on stage.

16:49.332 --> 16:53.772
I know you think we purposely ruined your
track, but it was an innocent mistake.

16:53.773 --> 16:57.900
We were playing around and we
accidentally recorded over your song.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.660
Nobody could be that careless.

16:59.661 --> 17:02.661
Well, Dez was there.

17:03.518 --> 17:08.425
Anyway. I want you to talk to your dad
about giving Austin his record deal back.

17:08.426 --> 17:13.624
I know Trish already tried, but I think
it would mean more coming from you.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.269
Why would I do that?

17:16.270 --> 17:19.161
Because I'm going to
give you my song.

17:19.162 --> 17:21.941
You wanted to sing
it tonight, well...

17:21.942 --> 17:23.452
Now you can.

17:23.453 --> 17:26.294
I thought you were never gonna give
it away because it was too personal.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.751
It is. It's the most personal
song I've ever written.

17:29.752 --> 17:32.900
It's about how I faced
my biggest fear and...

17:32.901 --> 17:35.683
I wanted to be the
one to sing it.

17:35.684 --> 17:39.720
But I'm willing to give it up if it'll
help Austin get a second chance.

17:39.721 --> 17:41.321
Wow.

17:41.322 --> 17:43.181
Ally, you'd really do that?

17:43.182 --> 17:44.286
Sure.

17:44.287 --> 17:47.206
I can always develop
another paralyzing fear,

17:47.207 --> 17:51.566
overcome it, and write a
deeply personal song about it.

17:51.567 --> 17:57.027
Look, I need to think about this.
I gotta go perform.

18:00.093 --> 18:02.576
Ally, you can't give
up your song for me.

18:02.577 --> 18:04.457
Too late. I already did.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.547
You weren't supposed
to say anything.

18:06.548 --> 18:09.848
Too late. I already did.

18:13.212 --> 18:16.641
Thanks, everybody. I'm
really excited to be here.

18:16.642 --> 18:22.013
I was just given an amazing new song and
it's the perfect way to open my show.

18:22.014 --> 18:25.230
But I realize there's only one
person who should sing it.

18:25.231 --> 18:28.930
Ally, will you please come
up here and sing your song?

18:28.931 --> 18:30.731
Go.

18:35.635 --> 18:37.630
I'll talk to my
dad about Austin.

18:37.631 --> 18:40.091
Thanks, Kira.

18:44.283 --> 18:47.449
Hi, everybody. I'm Ally Dawson.

18:47.450 --> 18:53.350
There was a time when I never could
have imagined myself on stage.

18:53.455 --> 18:57.463
But I wouldn't be here today if it
wasn't for my friends Austin, Trish...

18:57.464 --> 19:00.404
Just sing the song!

19:00.923 --> 19:05.183
This song is called
"I'm Finally Me".

19:10.171 --> 19:13.944
<i>♪ I've never felt this before.</i>

19:13.945 --> 19:17.799

20:15.344 --> 20:17.566
You were fantastic.

20:17.567 --> 20:20.141
Ally, that was an
amazing performance.

20:20.142 --> 20:21.395
Thanks.

20:21.396 --> 20:24.034
Kira told me what you were
willing to do for Austin.

20:24.035 --> 20:27.027
Maybe I did overreact
about this whole thing.

20:27.028 --> 20:29.869
Austin, I want you
back at Starr Records.

20:29.870 --> 20:31.637
- All right!
- Awesome.

20:31.638 --> 20:32.987
Jimmy, wait.

20:32.988 --> 20:35.523
I don't want you
to take me back.

20:35.524 --> 20:39.004
Austin, what are you doing?

20:39.191 --> 20:41.320
You keep saying you can't
sign Ally because you

20:41.321 --> 20:43.580
don't want both of us on
the same record label.

20:43.581 --> 20:45.407
So...

20:45.408 --> 20:47.951
Take her instead of me.

20:47.952 --> 20:50.643
Austin, you don't have
to do that for me.

20:50.644 --> 20:53.145
You're right. He doesn't.

20:53.146 --> 20:56.165
What you both did tonight
showed a lot of character.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.908
You're exactly the kind of people
I want to be in business with.

20:59.909 --> 21:03.480
- Are you saying...?
- Yep. Not only do I want Austin back.

21:03.481 --> 21:06.341
But Ally, I want to
offer you a deal, too.

21:06.342 --> 21:09.222
- Seriously?!
- No way!

21:09.223 --> 21:11.288
Jimmy, as Austin's manager,

21:11.289 --> 21:14.954
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be back in business with you.

21:14.955 --> 21:18.555
As Ally's manager,
I'll get back to you.

21:18.556 --> 21:21.254
Trish, what are you doing?

21:21.255 --> 21:22.986
We appreciate the offer,

21:22.987 --> 21:26.128
but Ally hasn't decided which
label she wants to sign with yet.

21:26.129 --> 21:29.518
I told you I was gonna set up
meetings with other record labels.

21:29.519 --> 21:30.787
And I did.

21:30.788 --> 21:32.404
Wow, I'm impressed.

21:32.405 --> 21:35.220
You really are
Manager of the Year.

21:35.221 --> 21:39.695
Actually, she messed up on the date, so
we didn't get the application in on time.

21:39.696 --> 21:42.942
But there's always next year.

21:42.943 --> 21:45.441
Kira, thanks for everything.

21:45.442 --> 21:47.601
Maybe I can write you
another song some day.

21:47.602 --> 21:50.848
Thanks Ally. I should probably
get back to my concert.

21:50.849 --> 21:54.149
- Knock 'em dead.
- Woo!

21:56.387 --> 21:58.913
Hey, Ally, I videotaped
your entire performance

21:58.914 --> 22:00.991
so you'll never forget

Man, this is just not my day.

Rachel, send in my next meeting.

22:32.510 --> 22:35.683
Okay, Dez. What is it?

22:35.684 --> 22:37.605
Oh no.

22:37.606 --> 22:41.521
Jimmy, have you considered the
benefits of owning an Alpaca herd?

22:41.522 --> 22:45.175
- Why do I take meetings with you?
- These babies are a gold mine.

22:45.176 --> 22:48.172
They produce the softest
fleece in the world.

22:48.173 --> 22:51.987
You could make Alpaca coats,
Alpaca gloves, Alpaca underwear...

22:51.988 --> 22:53.318
Dez, get out.

22:53.319 --> 22:56.097
Okay. But once I leave...

22:56.098 --> 22:59.698
This offer is off the table.

23:00.388 --> 23:02.306
I'm walking out the door.
