WEBVTT

00:01.389 --> 00:04.753
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:05.548 --> 00:07.049
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.885
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.953 --> 00:13.154
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:13.222 --> 00:15.389
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:15.457 --> 00:17.458
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.526 --> 00:20.261
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.329 --> 00:22.230
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.332 --> 00:24.832
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:26.467
Should we shoot them?

00:26.535 --> 00:28.269
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.337 --> 00:31.038
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.106 --> 00:33.407
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.475 --> 00:35.343
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:38.479
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:38.547 --> 00:40.114
That's how we do it,
people.

00:40.182 --> 00:42.783
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:42.851 --> 00:44.619
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:47.825 --> 00:50.794
<i>In prison,</i>
<i>there is no such thing</i>

00:50.862 --> 00:52.429
<i>as good attention.</i>

00:52.497 --> 00:54.197
<i>It's better to be a number</i>
<i>than to be known.</i>

00:54.265 --> 00:55.966
Take off
her restraints.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.734
<i>Because with anonymity</i>
<i>comes safety.</i>

00:57.802 --> 00:59.703
<i>So whether you're dealing</i>
<i>with a fellow inmate,</i>

00:59.771 --> 01:01.938
<i>a guard,</i>
<i>or the warden herself,</i>

01:02.006 --> 01:03.440
<i>the last thing you want</i>

01:03.508 --> 01:05.642
<i>is for your name</i>
<i>to be on their mind.</i>

01:05.710 --> 01:07.010
Inmate Glenanne.

01:07.078 --> 01:10.080
We have a room waiting for you
in cell block 9.

01:10.148 --> 01:12.249
That is the wing
for high-risk offenders.

01:12.316 --> 01:14.184
See, I heard about
the incident

01:14.252 --> 01:16.052
between you
and inmate Doneski.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.721
So what we're going
to do

01:17.789 --> 01:21.558
is have you sign a request
for protective custody

01:21.626 --> 01:23.460
and put you
in the segregated wing.

01:23.528 --> 01:24.728
I'd rather not.

01:24.796 --> 01:28.498
I'm doing my best
to help you right now.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.568
High-profile prisoners get
special treatment around here --

01:31.636 --> 01:32.702
not the good kind.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.805
I appreciate your concern,
Warden,

01:34.872 --> 01:36.673
but I can
take care of myself.

01:36.741 --> 01:37.941
You got a death wish,

01:38.009 --> 01:39.709
play it out
in someone else's facility.

01:39.777 --> 01:41.344
Sign the damn form.

01:41.412 --> 01:45.348
Well, it is my choice,
isn't it?

01:45.416 --> 01:47.217
Can't say
I didn't try.

01:47.285 --> 01:48.819
One more thing --

01:48.886 --> 01:52.556
you have a visitor request
from Michael Westen.

01:52.623 --> 01:55.325
I don't know how you got
privileges so quickly,

01:55.393 --> 01:57.027
but if you want
to sign <i>this</i> one,

01:58.329 --> 01:59.596
he'll be on the list
for Wednesday.

01:59.664 --> 02:01.798
Hopefully you'll last
that long.

02:07.839 --> 02:09.806
<i>When you've been marked</i>
<i>for death,</i>

02:09.874 --> 02:12.242
<i>hiding is</i>
<i>a short-term strategy.</i>

02:12.310 --> 02:14.044
<i>It might buy you time,</i>

02:14.111 --> 02:16.112
<i>but it won't solve</i>
<i>your problem.</i>

02:16.180 --> 02:18.481
<i>To do that, you need contact.</i>

02:18.549 --> 02:22.419
<i>It means exposing yourself</i>
<i>to more potential threats,</i>

02:22.486 --> 02:23.954
<i>but it also means</i>

02:24.021 --> 02:27.557
<i>having the opportunity</i>
<i>to find potential allies.</i>

02:27.625 --> 02:30.460
Well, if it isn't
the newest resident

02:30.528 --> 02:31.995
of cell block 9.

02:32.063 --> 02:32.996
You're Ayn?

02:33.064 --> 02:35.031
That I am.

02:35.099 --> 02:36.399
I heard
you can get things.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.702
Wine, cigarettes.

02:38.769 --> 02:40.103
Or if you're
into something stronger,

02:40.171 --> 02:42.272
I can make that happen,
too.

02:42.340 --> 02:46.109
It's why they call me Ayn --
"anything you need."

02:48.045 --> 02:49.546
Someone in here
is trying to have me killed.

02:49.614 --> 02:51.014
I need to find out who.

02:51.082 --> 02:52.749
You want to know
who's trying to kill you?

02:52.817 --> 02:54.050
Damn, girl.

02:54.118 --> 02:56.052
You just skipped all over
the small talk.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.888
Whatever happened to,
"where you from?

02:57.955 --> 02:59.923
What you in for?
How many years you get?"

02:59.991 --> 03:03.326
Ireland, something I didn't do,
God knows how long.

03:03.394 --> 03:04.661
Can you help me?

03:04.729 --> 03:06.263
Info like that
doesn't come cheap.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.198
Name a price.

03:08.266 --> 03:11.801
See, now, that's where
you being new creates a problem.

03:11.869 --> 03:14.037
Money around here's
canteen credits.

03:14.105 --> 03:15.739
You don't have any.

03:15.806 --> 03:19.509
I'm sure there are other ways
to make it worth your while.

03:19.577 --> 03:21.578
There's always favor
for a favor.

03:21.646 --> 03:23.947
But I doubt
you want to go there.

03:24.015 --> 03:26.549
Try me.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.823
Dude.

03:33.891 --> 03:35.025
You've checked your watch
three times

03:35.092 --> 03:36.126
in the last 30 seconds.

03:36.193 --> 03:38.628
It's still...10:05,
okay? Relax.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.397
Pearce sounded a little off
on the phone.

03:40.464 --> 03:41.998
She specifically asked
to meet here --

03:42.066 --> 03:43.900
not the office --
which means something's wrong.

03:43.968 --> 03:46.136
Or she knows
you're about to visit Fi,

03:46.203 --> 03:47.604
and she's got news
about Anson.

03:47.672 --> 03:49.105
Maybe she found
the son of a bitch.

03:49.173 --> 03:50.340
Maybe Fi's
about to be released.

03:50.408 --> 03:51.608
Oh, I could be wrong.

03:52.977 --> 03:56.046
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.

03:56.113 --> 03:57.714
What's going on?
I, uh...

03:59.383 --> 04:01.184
I honestly don't know
where to start.

04:01.252 --> 04:02.953
Why don't you start
from the beginning?

04:03.020 --> 04:04.454
I came back
from lunch yesterday.

04:04.522 --> 04:06.389
There was a message
on my phone.

04:07.892 --> 04:09.693
<i>Agent Pearce,</i>
<i>this is Anson Fullerton.</i>

04:09.760 --> 04:14.230
<i>You've been making life</i>
<i>awfully hard for me lately.</i>

04:14.298 --> 04:15.765
<i>Now, I'm sure Michael's</i>
<i>filled your head with lies,</i>

04:15.833 --> 04:18.067
<i>but I am not the monster</i>
<i>he makes me out to be.</i>

04:18.135 --> 04:19.369
<i>And to prove it...</i>

04:19.437 --> 04:21.237
<i>I'd like to offer you</i>
<i>an olive branch.</i>

04:21.305 --> 04:23.273
<i>I had a chance to read</i>
<i>your personnel file,</i>

04:23.341 --> 04:25.408
<i>and I noticed you spent</i>
<i>many years</i>

04:25.476 --> 04:28.044
<i>trying to find out</i>
<i>what happened to Jay Toonberg.</i>

04:28.112 --> 04:29.579
<i>I'd like to help.</i>

04:31.115 --> 04:32.849
What the hell's
he talking about?

04:32.917 --> 04:35.285
Jay and Pearce
were engaged.

04:35.353 --> 04:36.953
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:39.323 --> 04:40.890
This was waiting for me
at home.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.326
His name is Ahmed Damour.

04:43.394 --> 04:45.562
Meet the man
who murdered my fiancÃ©.

04:45.944 --> 04:49.444
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 6x03</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Last Rites</font>
Original Air Date on June 28, 2012

04:49.445 --> 04:52.945
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

04:53.274 --> 04:54.859
It's all right there.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.160
Jay was working undercover,

04:56.228 --> 04:58.129
gathering intelligence
on the Syrian military.

04:58.196 --> 04:59.563
His cover got blown, and before
they could pull him out,

04:59.631 --> 05:01.432
Ahmed killed him.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.034
And the best part --
now <i>he's</i> the CIA asset.

05:04.102 --> 05:05.903
He's getting rich
selling us the same intel

05:05.971 --> 05:08.272
he stole from Jay,
and we're protecting him.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.540
So this murderer's living
the high life in Bermuda

05:09.608 --> 05:11.342
on the Agency's dime.

05:11.409 --> 05:13.110
That is nice work
if you can get it.

05:13.178 --> 05:14.945
Talk to your boss about it yet?
Oh, no, I can't.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.480
I'm not even supposed to know
that file exists.

05:16.548 --> 05:18.215
They'd just order me
to let it go.

05:18.283 --> 05:19.316
But I can't do that.

05:19.384 --> 05:20.885
Has it occurred to you

05:20.952 --> 05:22.386
that Anson knew
Ahmed was protected

05:22.454 --> 05:23.787
when he
dropped his name?

05:23.855 --> 05:25.122
He knows you're helping us
get Fi out of prison.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.324
He wants you
to throw your career away.

05:27.392 --> 05:29.226
I get it, Westen,

05:29.294 --> 05:32.363
but some things are more
important than a career.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.398
You're not the only person
who ever lost somebody.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.468
So, what? What?
It's an eye for an eye now?

05:37.536 --> 05:39.637
Come on, Pearce.
That's not you.

05:39.704 --> 05:41.472
It is when
that's the only option.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.940
Pearce,
it's not the only option.

05:43.008 --> 05:44.542
The Agency is
only protecting Ahmed

05:44.609 --> 05:46.177
until they get
their intelligence.

05:46.244 --> 05:49.980
We take away those secrets,
we take away his protection.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.348
<i>He</i> goes down.
You don't.

05:51.416 --> 05:53.651
We can help you do that.
I promise.

05:57.522 --> 06:00.090
Hate to say it, Mike,
but I think

06:00.158 --> 06:02.993
your mouth wrote a check
that your butt can't cash.

06:03.061 --> 06:04.461
I mean, you see
the section here

06:04.529 --> 06:06.964
where the <i>CIA</i>
<i>says Ahmed is untouchable?</i>

06:07.032 --> 06:09.633
I think that means,
you know, "no touching."

06:09.701 --> 06:11.302
Maybe you missed
<i>this</i> page.

06:11.369 --> 06:12.870
The CIA doesn't care
about Ahmed.

06:12.938 --> 06:14.205
They care
about the intel.

06:14.272 --> 06:15.873
He's got all the files
on a hard drive.

06:15.941 --> 06:18.409
Once we find that drive,
we turn it over to the CIA

06:18.476 --> 06:20.211
they'll wrap him up.

06:20.278 --> 06:21.912
Yeah, no,
I definitely saw that page,

06:21.980 --> 06:24.515
just like I saw
this one here.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.917
Agency sent a team
into his Bermuda compound

06:26.985 --> 06:28.485
back in '08
looking for the hard drive.

06:28.553 --> 06:29.753
They didn't find it.

06:29.821 --> 06:31.455
I mean, what makes
you think we <i>can?</i>

06:31.523 --> 06:33.691
Sam, if I don't help Pearce,
she's gonna ruin her career.

06:33.758 --> 06:35.192
Without her
at the Agency,

06:35.260 --> 06:36.760
I'll never get Fi
out of prison.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.132
Okay, well, wait.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.368
It says here
the guy's getting ready

06:44.436 --> 06:45.536
to take a cruise.

06:45.604 --> 06:47.371
Maybe you isolate him
on the boat --

06:47.439 --> 06:49.707
make him think
that he's sick.

06:49.774 --> 06:51.575
If he doesn't think
he's gonna make it...

06:51.643 --> 06:52.743
He's gonna
start talking.

06:52.811 --> 06:53.644
And the first person
he'll call is his

06:53.712 --> 06:54.745
son, Sharif. Son, Sharif.

06:54.813 --> 06:56.513
Back in Bermuda.
It's perfect, Sam.

06:56.581 --> 06:57.648
So perfect
it's not gonna work.

06:57.716 --> 06:59.083
We don't have
the manpower.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.618
You got to have
three on the cruise,

07:00.685 --> 07:01.752
three on the land side,

07:01.820 --> 07:03.354
and if the CIA
can't know about this,

07:03.421 --> 07:04.788
well,
they're not gonna pitch in.

07:04.856 --> 07:06.023
I can get you a team.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.291
Ohh!

07:07.359 --> 07:09.693
Who -- Nate and your ma?

07:10.962 --> 07:12.563
Oh, wow.
You're not kidding, are you?

07:12.631 --> 07:14.832
Look, Mike,
nothing against the Westen clan,

07:14.899 --> 07:17.935
but I'm gonna be real glad
when we get Fi out of the clink.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.438
Just pick a book,
bitch.

07:21.506 --> 07:22.873
You know you can't read.

07:29.214 --> 07:30.581
Press on, honey.

07:33.451 --> 07:35.219
Is there anything
you <i>can't</i> get in here?

07:35.287 --> 07:37.121
If the price was right,

07:37.188 --> 07:38.555
I could stage
a Beatles reunion concert

07:38.623 --> 07:39.990
in the main yard.

07:40.058 --> 07:42.259
All <i>I</i> need is a name.

07:42.327 --> 07:45.529
Yes, you do.
And a pricey one at that.

07:45.597 --> 07:47.164
I'm all ears.

07:47.232 --> 07:51.769
Tomorrow at 2:15,
I need that door locked tight,

07:51.836 --> 07:54.538
and I need it to stay that way
for about two minutes.

07:54.606 --> 07:56.106
You do me that favor,

07:56.174 --> 07:58.409
and I'll help you find out
who's trying to kill you.

07:58.476 --> 08:01.578
Doing it without getting caught
would be almost impossible.

08:01.646 --> 08:03.580
I can't risk
going to segregation.

08:03.648 --> 08:05.816
I thought that might be
a deal breaker.

08:05.884 --> 08:07.151
No hard feelings,
honey.

08:12.957 --> 08:15.526
I said
<i>"almost</i> impossible."

08:15.593 --> 08:18.128
Get me these supplies,
it's a deal.

08:18.196 --> 08:19.897
That's a hell
of a shopping list.

08:19.964 --> 08:21.165
It's a hell of a favor.

08:21.232 --> 08:23.500
Magnesium?
Overnight?

08:23.568 --> 08:25.402
Honey, I'm good,
but I'm not magic.

08:25.470 --> 08:27.037
What about a sparkler?

08:30.208 --> 08:32.308
You know,
this breaks one of my rules...

08:32.376 --> 08:34.945
But I might decide
to like you, criminal.

08:42.654 --> 08:45.322
So, when we're following
this Sharif kid

08:45.390 --> 08:47.591
all over Bermuda,
where <i>you</i> gonna be?

08:47.659 --> 08:50.160
I'm gonna be on a cruise
with his dad, Ahmed.

08:50.228 --> 08:52.663
Trust me --
it's not for pleasure.

08:52.731 --> 08:54.365
Okay, you've got
your cover I.D.s,

08:54.432 --> 08:56.834
tickets,
traveler's checks.

08:56.901 --> 08:58.335
You're on the 9:25
out of Miami.

08:58.403 --> 09:01.205
Sam will go over
the rest when you get there.

09:01.272 --> 09:02.940
And is <i>he</i> going to tell us
what this is really about?

09:04.075 --> 09:06.777
Ahmed has
valuable information,

09:06.845 --> 09:08.812
and we need to get it back.
I heard that part.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.414
If this was just
about stolen secrets,

09:10.482 --> 09:13.350
you wouldn't
need Nate and me.

09:13.418 --> 09:14.818
Come on, Mom.
You know how this works.

09:14.886 --> 09:17.521
The details are probably, like,
classified or whatever.

09:17.589 --> 09:19.857
Can't you just be happy
helping out Mike?

09:19.924 --> 09:21.091
This isn't
watering someone's plants

09:21.159 --> 09:23.127
while
they're out of town!

09:23.194 --> 09:25.562
You're asking us
to fly to another country

09:25.630 --> 09:27.197
with a fake I.D.,

09:27.265 --> 09:30.934
dealing with spies
at the drop of a hat!

09:31.002 --> 09:32.569
I want to know why!

09:32.637 --> 09:35.439
Is this about Fi?

09:35.507 --> 09:37.908
No, Mrs. Westen.
This is about me.

09:37.976 --> 09:40.744
Ahmed didn't just steal
information.

09:40.812 --> 09:42.479
He killed my fiancÃ©.

09:42.547 --> 09:45.616
But the CIA doesn't know
we're going after him.

09:45.683 --> 09:47.684
If you don't feel comfortable
coming along, I totally --

09:47.752 --> 09:50.254
Honey, please,
just stop.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.957
I'll do it.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.074

10:07.105 --> 10:09.039
<i>Effective</i>
<i>interrogations take many forms</i>

10:09.107 --> 10:12.075
<i>but usually include</i>
<i>three key elements.</i>

10:12.143 --> 10:15.012
<i>First, you need a target</i>
<i>with the intel you're after.</i>

10:22.787 --> 10:26.290
<i>Then you need</i>
<i>an interrogation team.</i>

10:26.357 --> 10:28.125
<i>Their job is</i>
<i>to secure the target</i>

10:28.193 --> 10:29.493
<i>and do whatever it takes</i>

10:29.561 --> 10:31.395
<i>to obtain</i>
<i>actionable intelligence.</i>

10:31.463 --> 10:33.697
<i>But getting useful information</i>
<i>doesn't matter</i>

10:33.765 --> 10:35.299
<i>if you can't move on it.</i>

10:35.366 --> 10:38.035
<i>Which is why you need</i>
<i>a support team in the field.</i>

10:38.102 --> 10:40.137
Okay, Mike,
you got the murderer.

10:40.205 --> 10:41.572
We'll get
the son of a murderer.

10:41.639 --> 10:43.507
Hope you took
your Dramamine.

10:43.575 --> 10:44.908
Thanks, Sam. We'll call you
when we have something.

10:44.976 --> 10:47.077
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>the whole system breaks down</i>

10:47.145 --> 10:50.047
<i>if someone kills the target</i>
<i>before he can talk.</i>

10:50.114 --> 10:51.448
Pearce,
you should look like

10:51.516 --> 10:53.050
you're ready
for a fun vacation,

10:53.117 --> 10:54.418
not trying
to kill someone.

10:54.486 --> 10:55.886
I just want
that son of a bitch

10:55.954 --> 10:57.888
to suffer like Jay did.
Don't worry.

10:57.956 --> 11:00.390
In about six hours,
Ahmed will wish he was dead.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.160
But the plan only works
if you can hold it together.

11:03.228 --> 11:04.661
This better?

11:04.729 --> 11:06.430
Yes.

11:09.367 --> 11:14.137
Look, we need to run
a stat blood series.

11:14.205 --> 11:18.775
Stat blood series --
CBC, CMP P.T., and a PTT...

11:18.843 --> 11:22.546
Don't forget a blt
and a PB&J, A.S.A.P.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.216
Fiona usually would help me with this.
You're good, man.

11:26.284 --> 11:27.885
You sound like an
infectious-disease specialist.

11:27.952 --> 11:28.819
You got it.

11:30.688 --> 11:32.456
Hope you got
that prazosin ready.

11:32.524 --> 11:35.125
Ready to make a grown man cry.
Where's Ahmed?

11:35.193 --> 11:36.627
In the casino,
playing craps...

11:36.694 --> 11:38.662
making sure all the ladies
see his $50,000 Rolex.

11:38.730 --> 11:41.265
It's disgusting.
Pearce.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.600
I'm smiling. See?

11:43.668 --> 11:46.136
We do have
one little complication, though.

11:46.204 --> 11:47.638
Ahmed's bodyguard
is hovering around him

11:47.705 --> 11:49.373
like a helicopter mom.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.541
The guy does everything
for him,

11:50.608 --> 11:51.942
including getting
his drinks.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.644
So if we're gonna
poison him there,

11:53.711 --> 11:55.579
we might need you
to give us an extra distraction.

11:55.647 --> 11:56.780
I would love to,

11:56.848 --> 11:58.115
but we can't risk Ahmed
seeing me

11:58.182 --> 11:59.182
before he's
in the infirmary.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.551
Jesse can sell this.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.853
Please. I could do this
by myself if I had to.

12:04.122 --> 12:05.923
Go get
your party dress on.

12:20.371 --> 12:21.572
It's all
how you shake them.

12:21.639 --> 12:23.740
You got to let them know
you love them, okay?

12:23.808 --> 12:25.709
All right. How about
a little kiss for luck?

12:25.777 --> 12:26.910
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:26.978 --> 12:28.579
You see what I did?!

12:28.646 --> 12:30.681
Then you let them know
you love them. I love you.

12:30.748 --> 12:32.049
And if you love something,
what do you do?

12:32.116 --> 12:32.950
You set it free!

12:35.153 --> 12:36.353
Boom!

12:36.421 --> 12:38.322
That is how
you throw the bones, my friends!

12:41.726 --> 12:44.928
I hope
you enjoyed my drink.

12:44.996 --> 12:47.831
That's $100 a shot, you idiot.
My bad, man.

12:47.899 --> 12:49.900
But you know what? There's still a
little bit left. Do you want to finish it?

12:49.968 --> 12:51.234
Next round's on me.

12:51.302 --> 12:52.669
Okay, what is that --
Jack? Old crow? What you got?

12:52.737 --> 12:53.737
Johnnie Walker Blue
on the rocks.

12:53.805 --> 12:55.839
Ooh, excuse me, mister!

12:55.907 --> 12:57.941
Johnnie Walker Blue
on the rocks.

12:58.009 --> 12:59.176
Sexiness!

12:59.243 --> 13:01.144
Can we get a nice,
fresh refill for my man?

13:01.212 --> 13:02.446
Johnnie Walker Blue
on the rocks.

13:02.513 --> 13:03.847
I'll get it.

13:03.915 --> 13:06.049
<i>Personal bodyguards</i>
<i>are specifically trained</i>

13:06.117 --> 13:08.619
<i>to identify and prioritize</i>
<i>potential threats...</i>

13:08.686 --> 13:10.120
Johnnie Walker Blue.

13:10.188 --> 13:11.822
<i>...which means</i>
<i>getting their attention</i>

13:11.889 --> 13:15.025
<i>is usually as easy as becoming</i>
<i>the most immediate threat</i>

13:15.093 --> 13:17.628
<i>in the area.</i>
<i>You know what? Give me those.</i>

13:17.695 --> 13:18.829
My turn.
You got bad juju.

13:18.896 --> 13:19.997
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

13:20.064 --> 13:21.264
I'll tell you
what I'm <i>not</i> doing --

13:21.332 --> 13:22.566
I'm not trying to sit here
and see how many times

13:22.634 --> 13:24.668
one man can
roll snake eyes, okay?

13:26.037 --> 13:27.971
You had your turn.
Give them to me.

13:28.039 --> 13:29.373
You know what?
Fine, fine.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.041
You want to burn down the house?
Have at it.

13:31.109 --> 13:32.776
I'm pulling the rip cord,
baby.

13:32.844 --> 13:33.877
Poof!

13:38.983 --> 13:40.250
How long till he drops?

13:40.318 --> 13:41.585
I don't know.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.287
It depends on how fast
he drinks his...drink.

13:44.355 --> 13:46.623
Shouldn't be long.

13:46.691 --> 13:51.561
<i>The difference between</i>
<i>a drug being called "medicine"</i>

13:51.629 --> 13:55.532
<i>or "poison" comes down</i>
<i>to one thing -- dosage.</i>

13:55.600 --> 13:57.834
<i>The recommended amount</i>
<i>of prazosin</i>

13:57.902 --> 14:00.137
<i>will effectively regulate</i>
<i>blood pressure.</i>

14:00.772 --> 14:03.640
<i>But taking too much</i>
<i>will trigger side effects</i>

14:03.708 --> 14:06.943
<i>that mimic the symptoms</i>
<i>of an extreme viral infection.</i>

14:07.011 --> 14:08.645
<i>Once they kick in,</i>

14:08.713 --> 14:10.981
<i>instead of doubling down,</i>
<i>you'll be falling down.</i>

14:14.018 --> 14:15.786
That's a good look
for him.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.676
Oh, more
pleasure reading, huh?

14:28.744 --> 14:30.111
Yeah, I love reading

14:30.112 --> 14:32.213
"the principles and practices
of infectious disease control"

14:32.281 --> 14:33.581
in my spare time.

14:33.649 --> 14:35.083
Well, you're gonna
have to tear yourself away.

14:35.151 --> 14:36.484
It's time to roll.

14:36.552 --> 14:37.986
Yeah, we just checked out
the infirmary --

14:38.054 --> 14:39.287
whole lot of nervous people
down there

14:39.355 --> 14:40.889
trying to figure out
what's wrong with Ahmed.

14:40.956 --> 14:41.956
Perfect.
Let's fill in the blanks.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.392
I still wish
there was a way

14:44.460 --> 14:46.094
you didn't actually
have to take those.

14:46.162 --> 14:48.129
You and me both, sister.

14:48.197 --> 14:50.098
But the disease
is supposed to be infectious,

14:50.166 --> 14:52.333
and I can't fake a fever,
increased heart rate,

14:52.401 --> 14:53.435
and dilated pupils.

14:53.502 --> 14:55.036
At least
I only have to take it once.

14:55.104 --> 14:56.337
Mike,
can you water me, please?

14:59.175 --> 15:00.675
Jesse,
I can't thank you enough.

15:00.743 --> 15:03.211
Yeah, well, just try to keep me
away from that long tunnel

15:03.279 --> 15:04.679
with the bright light
at the end of it, will you?

15:07.917 --> 15:10.585
Where's the ship doctor?
We need help here!

15:10.653 --> 15:11.886
I'm Dr. Winnick.
What happened?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.755
Dr. Winnick,
I'm Dr. George Penderson, CDC.

15:13.823 --> 15:15.757
My wife, Jeannie, and I

15:15.825 --> 15:17.158
heard passengers screaming
for a doctor.

15:17.226 --> 15:18.760
We found this man
convulsing in the hallway.

15:18.828 --> 15:20.562
His name is Jamaal Howard,
age 36.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.430
No medical alert, I.D.s,
or cards.

15:22.498 --> 15:24.332
They said he was complaining
of blurry vision and dizziness.

15:25.768 --> 15:27.268
He's got elevated temp
and heart palpitations.

15:27.336 --> 15:28.436
Get him set up
in sick bay 2.

15:28.504 --> 15:31.439
Get his vitals,
and get him on O2.

15:34.110 --> 15:35.443
What?

15:35.511 --> 15:37.746
We have a passenger who came in
with the same symptoms.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.048
How long ago exactly?

15:40.116 --> 15:41.816
About nine hours or so.

15:41.884 --> 15:44.686
Why?
What are you thinking?

15:44.754 --> 15:46.354
You've got a serious problem
on your hands.

15:46.422 --> 15:49.190
Something's going around,
and it's not food poisoning.

15:49.258 --> 15:51.993
Based on the symptoms,
it's meningococcal.

15:52.061 --> 15:54.162
Yeah, that's right.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.498
Well, thank you for
bringing him in, Dr. Penderson.

15:56.565 --> 15:57.699
We can take it from here.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.067
Can you?

15:59.135 --> 16:01.636
Have you ever implemented
quarantine protocol?

16:01.704 --> 16:04.405
Well, no --
well, I have on three different continents.

16:04.473 --> 16:06.307
And, trust me,
you don't want to be on the hook

16:06.375 --> 16:07.876
for a full-scale outbreak.

16:07.943 --> 16:09.878
You're lucky
it's not airborne.

16:09.945 --> 16:12.113
You still have a chance,
but you're gonna need our help.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.448
Wait a minute,
Dr. Penderson.

16:13.516 --> 16:15.483
This is <i>my</i> infirmary.
I call the shots.

16:15.551 --> 16:16.684
I'm sorry.

16:16.752 --> 16:18.219
I'm...not trying
to big-dog anybody.

16:18.287 --> 16:20.555
I'm CDC. It's just
what I do for a living.

16:20.623 --> 16:23.258
Use me. I'll treat
the infected patients.

16:23.325 --> 16:24.859
You just take care
of the rest of the ship.

16:24.927 --> 16:26.728
Yes, but the ship regulations
require me.

16:26.796 --> 16:29.230
It's your call. You make
the wrong one, people die.

16:34.637 --> 16:36.171
Listen up, everybody.

16:36.238 --> 16:38.039
This infirmary
is now in quarantine.

16:38.107 --> 16:40.008
Kim, I want you to set up
a temporary exam room

16:40.075 --> 16:41.409
across the hall stat.

16:41.477 --> 16:42.844
This area is now off-limits

16:42.912 --> 16:44.679
until Dr. Penderson
says otherwise.

16:44.747 --> 16:46.347
Come on!
Let's go! Let's move!

16:49.785 --> 16:51.753
I need you to run
a stat blood series,

16:51.821 --> 16:54.756
including a CMP, CBC,
P.T., and a PTT.

16:56.358 --> 16:58.359
That man you brought in.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.862
You know him?

17:00.930 --> 17:02.831
I saw him at the casino
last night.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.031
He took my drink.

17:04.098 --> 17:05.733
He drank
from your glass?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.868
That must be
how you infected him.

17:07.936 --> 17:09.503
What?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.573
Mr. Damour,
my name is Dr. Penderson.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.176
I believe you've been infected
by a highly contagious

17:14.202 --> 17:15.742
and very deadly strain of meningitis.

17:17.012 --> 17:19.347
And it looks like
you gave it to Mr. Howard.

17:19.415 --> 17:20.582
W-what are you saying?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.916
First of all, it means
you're under quarantine.

17:22.984 --> 17:24.586
You --
you need to wait outside.

17:24.653 --> 17:27.288
We'll test you and seclude you
until we know you're clean.

17:31.193 --> 17:34.028
Now, w-wait, wait.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.763
Did you say "deadly"?

17:35.831 --> 17:38.066
Don't worry.
We'll do all that we can.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.868
Now, I need a list
of everyone

17:39.935 --> 17:41.903
you've been
in close contact with

17:41.971 --> 17:44.472
in the last 48 hours.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.140
My son, Sharif.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.710
Doctor, we've got
Mr. Howard stabilized.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.213
Thank you.
This is my wife, Jeannie.

17:53.415 --> 17:54.716
Don't worry.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.584
We're going to take good care
of you, Mr. Damour.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.554
Now, I need you
to call your son.

17:59.622 --> 18:02.824
We'll have someone sent out
to your home to test him.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.325
Not my house.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.527
I'll have him meet them.
It's better that way.

18:06.595 --> 18:08.930
I don't think you understand
what's at stake here.

18:08.998 --> 18:10.598
I'm a very private man.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.033
I can't have strangers
coming into my house.

18:12.101 --> 18:14.269
Mr. Damour,
in situations like this,

18:14.336 --> 18:15.470
the most important thing

18:15.537 --> 18:17.739
is finding the origin
of the infection.

18:17.806 --> 18:21.376
If it's in your home,
your son is in grave danger.

18:21.443 --> 18:23.778
We're not trying
to invade your privacy.

18:23.846 --> 18:26.614
We just want to do what's best
for you and your son.

18:28.450 --> 18:31.886
Fine, fine, fine.
I'll tell Sharif.

18:31.954 --> 18:32.987
Good.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.834
They got a saying
in here --

18:46.902 --> 18:48.803
never turn your back
on an open cell door.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.507
Oh, look at you.

18:52.574 --> 18:55.777
You got your own
little early-detection system.

18:57.513 --> 19:03.217
Six-pack, three cans of tuna,
plaster, a nail file,

19:03.285 --> 19:05.053
and your damn sparkler.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.287
You know how hard it is

19:06.355 --> 19:07.956
to get fireworks
this time of year?

19:08.023 --> 19:09.590
I need one more thing.

19:09.658 --> 19:12.694
The guards change shift
every day at 2:15.

19:12.761 --> 19:14.429
And I take my afternoon tea
at 4:00.

19:14.496 --> 19:15.797
What's your point?

19:15.864 --> 19:17.298
Why do you need me
to clear them off the block

19:17.366 --> 19:18.333
at that time?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.901
I'm throwing a party,

19:19.969 --> 19:23.104
and I can't have a guard
interrupting the fun.

19:23.172 --> 19:24.572
If this is a hit,
then I'm out.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.407
You really think
you're in a position

19:26.475 --> 19:27.709
to call the shots here?

19:27.776 --> 19:28.843
Or maybe
you just don't care

19:28.911 --> 19:30.778
who's trying to kill you
anymore.

19:30.846 --> 19:32.714
That it?

19:32.781 --> 19:35.049
Oh, I care,
but there is a line

19:35.117 --> 19:37.385
that I don't cross
for anyone, Ayn.

19:37.453 --> 19:38.686
That's why I'm here
in the first place.

19:38.754 --> 19:42.390
Oh. And here I thought
you were in here for murder.

19:44.126 --> 19:45.526
Okay, criminal.

19:45.594 --> 19:48.062
Can't promise
everyone's gonna end up smiling,

19:48.130 --> 19:50.898
but nobody's gonna
end up dead.

19:50.966 --> 19:53.735
Convict's word.
You still in?

19:56.705 --> 19:57.572
Yeah.

20:01.543 --> 20:04.178
<i>One of the easiest</i>
<i>and most efficient ways</i>

20:04.246 --> 20:06.147
<i>to make incendiary devices</i>
<i>begins with mixing</i>

20:06.215 --> 20:09.083
<i>aluminum powder</i>
<i>and plaster of paris.</i>

20:12.454 --> 20:14.288
<i>Once dry,</i>
<i>it burns at about 3,000 degrees</i>

20:14.356 --> 20:17.725
<i>and can melt solid steel</i>
<i>in under a minute.</i>

20:17.793 --> 20:19.961
<i>It's also completely stable</i>
<i>and safe to store</i>

20:20.029 --> 20:21.562
<i>until it's lit,</i>
<i>which is important</i>

20:21.630 --> 20:24.265
<i>because nobody should handle</i>
<i>a deadly incendiary</i>

20:24.333 --> 20:26.801
<i>without a good night's sleep.</i>

20:29.805 --> 20:31.939
Hi, we're from W.H.O.,
here to see Sharif Damour.

20:32.007 --> 20:33.207
One moment, please.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.410
Okay, Maddy, remember,
when we get in there,

20:35.477 --> 20:37.578
you got to keep
this guy Sharif busy long enough

20:37.646 --> 20:39.547
for us to find the office
and bug the phone.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.582
Didn't you say this guy's
some kind of a sociopath?

20:41.650 --> 20:44.285
Yeah, he does have
a few assaults on his rap sheet,

20:44.353 --> 20:45.787
but, uh,
he seems to prefer

20:45.854 --> 20:47.822
beating up waiters
and call girls.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.190
Mom, you're pretending
to be a nurse.

20:49.258 --> 20:51.125
I'm sure you'll be fine.

20:51.193 --> 20:53.294
Okay,
and we are transmitting.

20:53.362 --> 20:56.197
Maddy,
that's for you.

20:56.265 --> 20:58.666
You want me to get him
to wear <i>this?!</i>

20:58.734 --> 21:00.535
You said
it was a watch!

21:00.602 --> 21:03.137
Why didn't you just ask me to
tie a brick around his wrist?!

21:03.205 --> 21:05.440
Maddy, I'm sorry, but it's got
to be big enough to hold a GPS,

21:05.507 --> 21:06.841
so it's either that

21:06.909 --> 21:09.210
or we convince him
that pagers are back in style.

21:09.278 --> 21:10.545
Let's do it.

21:16.852 --> 21:18.519
You the outbreak people?

21:18.587 --> 21:20.521
Yes, sir.
Dr. Chuck Finley.

21:20.589 --> 21:22.156
Where's your
little astronaut suits?

21:22.224 --> 21:23.558
Uh, well,
the virus isn't airborne.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.059
Well, you sure scared
the hell out of my father.

21:25.127 --> 21:27.128
He made it sound like
the guys from "E.T."

21:27.196 --> 21:28.296
were on their way.

21:29.765 --> 21:31.365
Yeah, let's go.
Let's get this over with.

21:31.433 --> 21:32.934
We'll move as fast as we can,
Mr. Damour,

21:33.001 --> 21:34.802
but we need comprehensive
sampling of this house,

21:34.870 --> 21:36.471
and you need
to be examined immediately.

21:36.538 --> 21:38.406
Shelly, he's all yours.
Yeah.

21:38.474 --> 21:40.808
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:40.876 --> 21:45.046
He'll go with you --
make sure you don't get lost.

21:45.114 --> 21:48.049
Don't worry.
We'll move as fast as we can.

21:48.117 --> 21:50.251
I'm telling you
this is a waste of time.

21:52.521 --> 21:54.889
Do I look sick, huh?

21:54.957 --> 21:56.924
Come on.
I take care of mys--

21:56.992 --> 21:58.926
Open your mouth.
You look fine now.

21:58.994 --> 22:01.162
But changes happen quickly
with meningitis.

22:01.230 --> 22:06.134
<i>Hiding trackers in accessories</i>
<i>is a go-to trick for spies.</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:08.002
<i>Jewelry and watches</i>
<i>are attractive options,</i>

22:08.070 --> 22:09.303
<i>but there's always a risk</i>

22:09.371 --> 22:10.905
<i>they'll clash</i>
<i>with the target's outfit</i>

22:10.973 --> 22:12.874
<i>and get left at home.</i>

22:12.941 --> 22:14.475
105 beats a minute.

22:16.111 --> 22:17.411
Is that bad?

22:17.479 --> 22:18.946
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wear a monitor...

22:19.014 --> 22:20.982
<i>On the other hand, a tracker</i>
<i>that the target believes</i>

22:21.049 --> 22:24.652
<i>might save his life</i>
<i>is always in fashion.</i>

22:24.720 --> 22:26.087
...at all times.

22:26.155 --> 22:27.155
What do you mean,
"all time"?

22:27.222 --> 22:29.190
What if I go to a club?
You wear it.

22:29.258 --> 22:30.391
In the shower?

22:30.459 --> 22:31.492
At <i>all</i> times.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.693
Well,
that's ridiculous!

22:32.761 --> 22:34.328
If my heart speeds up,
I'll feel it!

22:34.396 --> 22:35.563
Really?

22:35.631 --> 22:37.498
Most people don't feel
their heartbeat

22:37.566 --> 22:39.467
until it hits, oh,
around 130.

22:39.535 --> 22:41.636
And by then, you will have
swelling of the brain,

22:41.703 --> 22:42.937
subcutaneous hemorrhaging,

22:43.005 --> 22:44.372
and will be
convulsing so hard

22:44.439 --> 22:46.774
you will not
be able to dial a phone.

22:46.842 --> 22:48.242
Fine, fine!

22:48.310 --> 22:51.679
Just...until the test results
come back.

22:55.450 --> 22:57.084
This room is clear.
Any positives?

22:57.152 --> 22:58.686
Nope.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.458
Hey, this room's
off-limits.

23:04.526 --> 23:05.893
Oh, really?

23:05.961 --> 23:07.128
Well, I'm thinking
that the virus

23:07.196 --> 23:08.362
didn't get that memo.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.132
We have to check
everything.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.800
Excuse me, sir.

23:12.868 --> 23:15.102
<i>Gram staining</i>
<i>is a method of testing</i>

23:15.170 --> 23:17.905
<i>for the presence</i>
<i>of certain types of bacteria.</i>

23:17.973 --> 23:20.074
<i>Positive results turn purple.</i>

23:20.142 --> 23:22.076
<i>Negative results turn pink.</i>

23:22.144 --> 23:24.645
<i>If you need a positive result</i>

23:24.713 --> 23:27.548

<i>a lethal microorganism.</i>

23:27.616 --> 23:30.618
<i>A little yogurt</i>
<i>will do the job.</i>

23:30.686 --> 23:32.954
<i>And, of course, no matter</i>
<i>what color a slide turns,</i>

23:33.021 --> 23:35.456
<i>nothing sells "scary"</i>
<i>like a big reaction.</i>

23:35.524 --> 23:37.758
Oh, my God.
Look at that reading.

23:37.826 --> 23:39.293
Have you been
in this room recently?

23:40.429 --> 23:41.429
Why are you
still standing there?!

23:41.496 --> 23:42.530
Get to the nurse! Go!

23:42.598 --> 23:43.531
Go!

23:48.604 --> 23:51.305
Wire it quick, Nate.
Yes, I will.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.210
Look up.

23:56.278 --> 23:58.379
Down.

23:58.447 --> 23:59.780
Right.

23:59.848 --> 24:01.916
Left.
Right again.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.252
What is this, dance class?
Enough of these tests.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.486
These are necessary,
Mr. Damour.

24:05.554 --> 24:08.789
No. I'm done.

24:08.857 --> 24:10.491
Oh,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:10.559 --> 24:12.360
What happened to our guests?
They think I might be infected.

24:12.427 --> 24:13.828
They said to come see
Nurse Shelly.

24:13.895 --> 24:15.763
And you left them where?
In the office.

24:15.831 --> 24:17.665
You left them
in my father's office?

24:17.733 --> 24:20.167
Stupid! Stupid!

24:20.235 --> 24:21.836
Mr. Damour,
we're not finished!

24:21.903 --> 24:23.170
No,
this exam is over!

24:27.109 --> 24:29.443
Whoa, you can't go in there!
No, <i>you</i> can't be in there!

24:29.511 --> 24:31.979
Sir, it's dangerous! Dangerous!
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

24:32.047 --> 24:34.282
What the hell are you doing taking
apart that telephone, huh?!

24:36.518 --> 24:37.485
Come on.

24:37.552 --> 24:38.719
I'll tell you
what he's doing.

24:38.787 --> 24:40.454
He's handling
some highly infectious bacteria!

24:40.522 --> 24:41.756
That's what
he's doing.

24:41.823 --> 24:43.391
Got to take it apart
to check it.

24:43.458 --> 24:44.625
Exactly.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.694
I mean,
this thing is filled with bugs,

24:46.762 --> 24:48.396
and I'm talking
nasty stuff.

24:48.463 --> 24:50.398
Have you used
this phone?

24:52.067 --> 24:53.334
Maybe a few times.

24:54.369 --> 24:55.836
Okay.

24:58.307 --> 25:00.308
What?

25:00.375 --> 25:02.877
Then I suggest you pray.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.715
Pray.

25:07.783 --> 25:09.650
Grab the gear, Chuck.
I'll meet you outside.

25:22.682 --> 25:25.357
Oh, more jello!
Delightful!

25:25.359 --> 25:27.246
Sorry.
You get what Ahmed gets.

25:28.620 --> 25:29.788
How's it coming?

25:29.855 --> 25:31.890
Let's see.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.925
Testing, testing.

25:33.993 --> 25:36.161
I want real food. One, two, three.
I want real food.

25:36.228 --> 25:37.462
Broadcast quality.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.965
And now that we've got
a tracker on Sharif,

25:40.032 --> 25:42.167
you and Mike can give Ahmed
one final push.

25:42.234 --> 25:44.736
Yeah, you know, maybe it's...
Best if Michael finishes this.

25:44.804 --> 25:45.837
I'm not sure I can --

25:45.905 --> 25:47.072
No, no, no. Hey.

25:47.139 --> 25:49.474
Don't start talking
like that -- not now.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.376
I am trying not to.
I really am.

25:51.444 --> 25:55.046
But I feel like if I go in there
one more time...

25:55.114 --> 25:57.983
I'll kill him...
or break down completely.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.352
Pearce. I know
this is a rough one.

26:00.419 --> 26:02.253
You got to figure out a way
to hold it together, okay?

26:02.321 --> 26:03.321
We're almost done.

26:03.389 --> 26:05.290
You don't understand.
I don't?

26:05.358 --> 26:07.325
My mom was on the wrong end
of a stickup.

26:07.393 --> 26:08.593
They never found the guy
that killed her.

26:08.661 --> 26:10.996
First thing I think of
every day is her.

26:11.063 --> 26:12.998
The second thing is how I wish
I can get the guy that did it.

26:13.065 --> 26:14.833
You have that chance.
Dani, look at me.

26:17.103 --> 26:18.570
You're gonna
finish this.

26:18.638 --> 26:20.405
If you don't, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

26:20.473 --> 26:21.406
Trust me.

26:21.474 --> 26:22.741
I know.

26:22.808 --> 26:23.975
Okay.
Okay.

26:24.043 --> 26:25.477
You ready to bring this home,
or what?

26:25.544 --> 26:26.978
Yes.
Good. 'Cause I'm sick of this damn jello.

26:27.046 --> 26:28.880
Stop whining, Porter.

26:28.948 --> 26:30.448
You sound like
a little girl.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.027
Have you heard anything
about my son?

26:42.094 --> 26:43.595
Is he infected?

26:43.663 --> 26:44.963
We're still waiting
to find out,

26:45.031 --> 26:46.798
but Sharif isn't showing
any symptoms for now.

26:48.668 --> 26:49.768
Mr. Damour,
we just got the results

26:49.835 --> 26:51.770
on the samples
from your house.

26:51.837 --> 26:54.472
I don't know
how to ask you this,

26:54.540 --> 26:55.740
but do you know of anyone

26:55.808 --> 26:57.542
who would want
to hurt you intentionally?

26:57.610 --> 26:58.910
What are you saying?

26:58.978 --> 27:01.646
The strain of the virus
they identified is...

27:01.714 --> 27:03.014
man-made.

27:03.082 --> 27:05.817
Our techs found
abnormally high concentrations

27:05.885 --> 27:07.652
on your phone, your car keys,
your toothbrush.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.521
Someone deliberately
infected me?

27:09.588 --> 27:11.089
Who?
We don't know, but, unfortunately,

27:11.157 --> 27:12.524
that is not
the worst part of it.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.959
There's no easy way
to say this.

27:15.027 --> 27:17.696
I'm afraid
your condition has advanced

27:17.763 --> 27:19.698
beyond the point of us being
able to help you, and...

27:19.765 --> 27:23.268
you're not going
to make it.

27:23.335 --> 27:24.903
You mean I <i>might</i> not.

27:24.970 --> 27:27.372
There are miracles...
sometimes.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.640
But with something
like this --

27:28.708 --> 27:30.241
Get out. Get out!

27:32.445 --> 27:34.312
I don't
want to see you.

27:37.183 --> 27:40.218
Please. There must be
something you can do.

27:40.286 --> 27:43.488
Mr. Damour, I know
this is tough to hear,

27:43.556 --> 27:44.756
but Dr. Penderson's right.

27:46.692 --> 27:48.560
How much time?

27:48.627 --> 27:49.894
If there's anything
you need to take care of,

27:49.962 --> 27:50.995
anyone you need
to talk to...

27:53.199 --> 27:54.299
...now is the time.

28:05.845 --> 28:06.878
That's impossible.

28:06.946 --> 28:07.946
They said you were sick,
not dying.

28:08.013 --> 28:09.280
Can't they
give you medicine?

28:09.348 --> 28:11.416
They found the virus
all over my things.

28:11.484 --> 28:14.085
Whoever it was...
they were trying to kill me.

28:14.153 --> 28:16.321
I don't understand.
Who would do this to you? Why?

28:16.388 --> 28:18.890
I don't know!
No one knows.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.626
It was probably the CIA.
They've always hated me.

28:21.694 --> 28:23.027
It doesn't matter now.

28:23.095 --> 28:25.063
I want to make sure
that you're --

28:25.131 --> 28:26.664
Wait, are you --
are you saying...

28:26.732 --> 28:27.866
Y-you're not coming home?

28:27.933 --> 28:30.969
Sharif! Answer me.

28:31.036 --> 28:32.570
Do you remember
what to do?

28:32.638 --> 28:33.671
Yes!

28:33.739 --> 28:34.773
I remember.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.175
Good. I want you to secure
your future.

28:37.243 --> 28:38.276
I want you to do it now.

28:38.344 --> 28:41.246
I will.

28:41.313 --> 28:42.580
Where are the files?

28:42.648 --> 28:44.682
They're at Habibi's place.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.718
Fourth shelf
of the remline chest.

28:46.786 --> 28:48.253
How soon
can you get there?

28:48.320 --> 28:49.320
I'll go
first thing tomorrow.

28:49.388 --> 28:50.789
Good.

28:50.856 --> 28:52.824
And call me
when it's done.

28:52.892 --> 28:54.692
I will.

29:04.069 --> 29:05.904
Hey, criminal.

29:05.971 --> 29:07.605
Don't you have
an errand to run?

29:07.673 --> 29:08.807
Shh.

29:08.874 --> 29:11.309
Breaking
my concentration.

29:11.377 --> 29:14.145
<i>Sabotage is best done</i>
<i>in private,</i>

29:14.213 --> 29:16.014
<i>when no one is around</i>
<i>to see it.</i>

29:16.081 --> 29:17.949
<i>If you don't have that luxury,</i>

29:18.017 --> 29:19.984
<i>you have to take</i>
<i>certain precautions.</i>

29:20.052 --> 29:21.820
<i>It's crucial</i>
<i>to conceal the real reason</i>

29:21.887 --> 29:23.154
<i>for your movements</i>

29:23.222 --> 29:24.923
<i>so that people</i>
<i>don't get suspicious.</i>

29:24.990 --> 29:27.292
You know, I could use
an extra blanket in my cell.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.027
Requests have to be made
on Monday

29:29.094 --> 29:30.628
to the unit manager,
Glenanne.

29:30.696 --> 29:32.931
Well, what am I gonna do
till then, huh? Hello?

29:32.998 --> 29:35.166
Wait,
are you telling me

29:35.234 --> 29:37.035
that I have to spend
another week

29:37.102 --> 29:38.536
freezing my ass off
in here?

29:46.412 --> 29:49.147
<i>It's also a good idea</i>
<i>to use time-delay devices</i>

29:49.215 --> 29:53.117
<i>so that when the fun starts,</i>
<i>you'll be nowhere near it.</i>

29:53.185 --> 29:54.319
You still haven't moved.

30:01.627 --> 30:03.595
Door's jammed.
I can't get it open.

30:03.662 --> 30:05.730
Code 6! Code 6!
Cell block 9!

30:05.798 --> 30:07.498
Officer needs assistance!

30:23.816 --> 30:25.917
All this for a robbery?
Robbery?

30:25.985 --> 30:27.619
You think I need
those scraps?

30:27.686 --> 30:28.853
This was business,
honey.

30:28.921 --> 30:30.088
My little friend over there
got the notion

30:30.155 --> 30:32.223
she could
open up shop on my block.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.759
I had to let her know
that market conditions

30:34.827 --> 30:37.562
weren't conducive
to expansion.

30:37.630 --> 30:39.497
Breaching.
All right! You know the drill!

30:39.565 --> 30:41.900
Everyone against the wall!
Eyes forward!

30:41.967 --> 30:44.035
Hands down,
God damn it!

30:44.103 --> 30:46.204
Hands at your sides!
I said eyes forward!

30:51.310 --> 30:53.378
We got some action.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.546
Doesn't look like
junior's planning

30:55.614 --> 30:56.848
on coming back
anytime soon.

30:56.916 --> 30:59.417
Too bad the guy doesn't know
his final destination.

30:59.485 --> 31:01.753
You don't have to pack
that heavy for Gitmo.

31:05.257 --> 31:07.225
Hold your little horses.
We're not going anywhere.

31:07.293 --> 31:09.260
Don't want to be
up the guy's butt.

31:09.328 --> 31:11.529
'Cause then what happens?
He sees you.

31:11.597 --> 31:12.931
'Cause then what happens?

31:12.998 --> 31:15.600
We lose our chance of getting
that top-secret intel.

31:15.668 --> 31:17.769
Now we can go.

31:38.691 --> 31:40.124
Okay, they definitely
pulled in.

31:41.827 --> 31:43.895
Right there.

31:48.901 --> 31:50.435
They're keeping
their top-secret files

31:50.502 --> 31:51.502
in a boathouse?

31:51.570 --> 31:52.804
Yeah,
it's not a bad plan --

31:52.871 --> 31:54.305
put all
your top-secret goodies

31:54.373 --> 31:56.607
in the same place
as your go-fast boat.

31:56.675 --> 31:58.309
Makes it easy
to blow town.

31:58.377 --> 32:00.211
And that's why
we're gonna bust in on their ass

32:00.279 --> 32:01.913
and make sure
that doesn't happen, right?

32:01.981 --> 32:03.948
Yes, Nate, but when you say
things like that,

32:04.016 --> 32:05.316
try and say them
like you understand

32:05.384 --> 32:06.684
how dangerous they are.

32:09.154 --> 32:10.888
Let's do it.

32:21.233 --> 32:24.102
<i>A successful ambush can</i>
<i>end a battle</i>

32:24.169 --> 32:26.004
<i>before it ever begins.</i>

32:26.071 --> 32:29.273
<i>To pull one off,</i>
<i>you need two key factors --</i>

32:29.341 --> 32:32.643
<i>the element of surprise</i>
<i>and superior positioning.</i>

32:32.711 --> 32:34.345
Okay, Nate,
you follow my lead.

32:34.413 --> 32:36.814
You don't make a move
until you see the intel.

32:36.882 --> 32:37.915
You got it?
Yeah.

32:37.983 --> 32:39.317
<i>The best staging areas</i>

32:39.385 --> 32:41.219
<i>offer a clear view</i>
<i>of your target</i>

32:41.286 --> 32:42.954
<i>while providing plenty of cover</i>
<i>for you.</i>

32:43.022 --> 32:44.622
Not yet.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.824
<i>Of course, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how good your position is</i>

32:46.892 --> 32:49.127
<i>if you're the one</i>
<i>who gets surprised.</i>

32:49.194 --> 32:50.728
What the hell's
going on?

32:50.796 --> 32:52.630
Shh. Just get down.

32:59.104 --> 33:02.640
Sharif,
it's a glorious day, no?

33:02.708 --> 33:04.108
I've had better.

33:04.176 --> 33:06.511
What? Smile.

33:06.578 --> 33:08.713
You're about to be
a rich man.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.014
Shall we toast?

33:10.082 --> 33:11.516
No time for drinks,
Yevgeni.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.151
As you wish, friend.

33:13.218 --> 33:14.318
Go on.

33:14.386 --> 33:18.890
First, we verify.
Then we pay.

33:25.731 --> 33:27.398
Dude,
who are these guys?

33:27.466 --> 33:29.067
Nate, I'm no expert,
but it looks like

33:29.134 --> 33:31.569
Sharif is making a deal
with some Russians.

33:31.637 --> 33:32.703
Russians?

33:32.771 --> 33:34.639
Why would Russians want
those files?

33:34.706 --> 33:36.441
Oh, these guys are working for
<i>themselves,</i> not their country.

33:36.508 --> 33:38.576
I mean,
this is business.

33:38.644 --> 33:39.811
Okay,
what's our next move?

33:43.315 --> 33:45.183
We don't have one.

33:50.869 --> 33:52.358
Come on. Come on.

33:55.732 --> 33:56.966
That was quick, Sam.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.168
Yeah, Mike,
this is not the victory call.

33:59.236 --> 34:00.303
This is the, uh,

34:00.370 --> 34:01.837
"you know what
hitting the fan" call.

34:01.905 --> 34:04.473
Sharif is making a deal
with a crew of FSB rejects.

34:04.541 --> 34:05.808
It's going on right now.

34:05.876 --> 34:07.043
Russians?!

34:07.110 --> 34:08.811
Yeah, it's like
a Cold War class reunion.

34:08.879 --> 34:09.812
Can you put
the brakes on it?

34:09.880 --> 34:10.980
It's five against two,

34:11.047 --> 34:12.380
and they're packing more heat
than we are.

34:12.449 --> 34:14.050
But, you know, sure,
what the hell? We can try.

34:14.117 --> 34:16.619
No, Sam. Sit tight.
It's too dangerous.

34:18.789 --> 34:20.222
So, they're gonna
do what?

34:20.290 --> 34:22.091
Just sit there
and let Sharif sail away

34:22.159 --> 34:23.192
with even more money?

34:23.260 --> 34:24.560
They make a move,
they're dead.

34:24.628 --> 34:25.795
Then <i>we</i> have to make
a move.

34:25.862 --> 34:26.996
We will,
but not right now.

34:27.063 --> 34:28.164
We have to hold off
until--

34:28.231 --> 34:30.199
No, we are not
holding off.

34:30.266 --> 34:32.268
We are ending this
right now.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.402
Pearce, what do you think
you're doing?

34:34.471 --> 34:36.005
I have a play here,
Westen.

34:36.072 --> 34:37.739
Back me up,
or stay out of the way.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.447
I don't care, George!
He deserves to know!

34:45.514 --> 34:46.614
Honey.

34:46.683 --> 34:48.516
If you won't tell him,
<i>I</i> will.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.286
Tell me what?

34:50.353 --> 34:51.654
My husband got a call
from the CDC.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.155
They've traced the origin
of your virus.

34:53.223 --> 34:55.524
It -- it's
classified information.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.493
We've been ordered
not to tell you.

34:57.561 --> 35:00.396
Please. Whatever it is,
I'm dying. I need to know.

35:01.798 --> 35:03.199
My feelings exactly.

35:03.266 --> 35:06.902
The virus you have is known
as the St. Petersburg strain.

35:09.673 --> 35:10.673
George?

35:10.741 --> 35:12.641
It's weaponized.

35:12.709 --> 35:15.544
It was developed by the FSB --
Russian intelligence.

35:15.612 --> 35:17.246
Russian?
Are you sure of this?

35:17.314 --> 35:18.481
Positive.

35:18.548 --> 35:21.517
The protein signatures
leave no doubt.

35:23.253 --> 35:24.286
Get out.

35:24.354 --> 35:27.523
Please.
I need to make a call.

35:35.198 --> 35:37.133
I have to take this.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.901
Hello, papa?

35:38.969 --> 35:40.636
Did he say "papa"?

35:40.704 --> 35:42.772
I think they're making a play
back on the boat.

35:42.839 --> 35:44.673
I'm fine.
I'm at Habibi's.

35:44.741 --> 35:46.308
We're doing the deal
right now.

35:46.376 --> 35:48.778
No, Sharif.
It was them!

35:48.845 --> 35:51.580
It was not the CIA.
It was the Russians!

35:51.648 --> 35:53.015
How do you know?

35:53.083 --> 35:54.917
The doctors traced
the virus.

35:54.985 --> 35:56.185
It was the FSB!

35:56.253 --> 35:58.654
Those dogs planned
this whole thing out!

35:58.722 --> 36:00.756
They're killing me
for the files.

36:00.824 --> 36:02.458
You need to get out.
Now!

36:02.526 --> 36:03.859
Don't worry, papa.

36:03.927 --> 36:06.929
I'll make sure tell them
you said hello.

36:06.997 --> 36:08.931
That was Ahmed?

36:08.999 --> 36:10.299
How is he?

36:10.367 --> 36:13.569
Doing quite well,
considering.

36:15.205 --> 36:17.273
He said
to give you a message.

36:32.556 --> 36:35.357
Okay, Nate.
Time for us to get in the game.

36:35.425 --> 36:36.859
Be ready.
For what?!

36:36.927 --> 36:40.296
When I get close,
shoot in the air.

36:42.332 --> 36:43.866
Ohh!

36:43.934 --> 36:45.234
Unh!

36:46.269 --> 36:47.236
Huh?!

36:52.976 --> 36:54.777
Oh.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.312
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:56.379 --> 36:59.348
Yevgeni, maybe you will see
my father in hell, huh?

37:03.320 --> 37:05.354
Nate, I said,
"shoot in the air."

37:05.422 --> 37:07.123
You didn't say, <i>"up</i> in the air."

37:08.992 --> 37:10.726
Yeah, Mike.

37:10.794 --> 37:12.228
This <i>is</i>
<i>the victory call.</i>

37:12.295 --> 37:14.163
We got good guys up,
bad guys down,

37:14.231 --> 37:15.664
and the files in hand.

37:28.445 --> 37:30.045
It's been too long.

37:30.113 --> 37:31.547
My son should have called
by now.

37:33.783 --> 37:37.386
It's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

37:37.454 --> 37:39.722
I used to talk
to my fiancÃ© twice a day.

37:39.789 --> 37:41.557
Then one day,
he didn't call.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.726
That's how I knew
something was wrong.

37:43.793 --> 37:47.496
He was a scientist
working in Paris.

37:47.564 --> 37:49.932
The last time I spoke to him,
he was filing a report

37:50.000 --> 37:51.867
about a Syrian
satellite installation

37:51.935 --> 37:53.569
outside Masyaf.

37:55.605 --> 37:57.039
You.

37:57.107 --> 38:00.409
Yes.

38:00.477 --> 38:01.544
Me.

38:01.611 --> 38:02.912
I was just trying
to scare him.

38:02.979 --> 38:05.948
You shot him
in the back.

38:06.016 --> 38:07.383
It was a mistake.
No!

38:07.450 --> 38:08.751
It was a choice.

38:08.818 --> 38:11.720
And for every choice,
there's a price.

38:11.788 --> 38:14.990
So the price is
you killing me with this virus?

38:16.760 --> 38:19.695
No.

38:19.763 --> 38:20.930
There's no virus.

38:20.997 --> 38:23.866
We have the information
you murdered Jay for.

38:23.934 --> 38:29.104
We have your son.
And we have you.

38:29.172 --> 38:31.473
I'm not killing you,
Ahmed.

38:31.541 --> 38:35.945
But believe me...
your life is over.

38:52.551 --> 38:54.419
I wish you'd relax,
criminal.

38:54.487 --> 38:56.187
Wears me out
just looking at you.

38:56.255 --> 38:57.489
Just tell me
you got something.

38:57.556 --> 38:59.457
Whoever it is
tried to kill you

38:59.525 --> 39:01.526
is working
with a dirty-ass guard.

39:01.594 --> 39:03.161
Well, what's his name?
Hold on, now.

39:03.229 --> 39:05.063
Before I provide
that information, you need --

39:05.131 --> 39:07.699
Quit with the games.
You tell me his name now.

39:07.767 --> 39:08.933
Easy now.

39:09.001 --> 39:10.602
I'm trying to protect
both of us here.

39:10.669 --> 39:12.370
Can't have you broadcasting
a guard's name

39:12.438 --> 39:13.671
over
the visiting-room phone.

39:13.739 --> 39:15.440
Okay?

39:15.508 --> 39:18.543
Just write down what you want
your boyfriend to know.

39:18.611 --> 39:20.612
I'll make sure
it gets delivered.

39:20.679 --> 39:22.380
Works better
for both of us.

39:25.284 --> 39:26.351
Sorry.

39:26.418 --> 39:29.154
Yeah, well...

39:29.221 --> 39:33.158
place changes all of us
sooner or later.

39:33.225 --> 39:34.225
Looks like sooner
for you.

40:11.697 --> 40:14.799
Now you see
why I never wear orange.

40:14.867 --> 40:16.267
You look beautiful.

40:19.738 --> 40:21.372
I'm gonna get you out.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.874
I promise you that.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.376
And we're --
we're getting close.

40:25.444 --> 40:26.477
The CIA --

40:26.545 --> 40:28.980
I love you, too,
Michael.

40:29.048 --> 40:31.049
We don't have much time.

40:31.116 --> 40:33.318
I don't want to
talk about that.

40:38.057 --> 40:40.325
You know what I was
thinking about the other day?

40:41.660 --> 40:44.062
That little dingy bar
in Belfast --

40:44.129 --> 40:45.630
the Black Sand Pub.

40:45.698 --> 40:47.465
You mean where we met.

40:47.533 --> 40:50.301
And I made the mistake
of asking...

40:52.538 --> 40:54.639
..."Would you like to dance?"

40:54.707 --> 41:00.345
Then you pulled
a snub-nose revolver on me.

41:00.412 --> 41:03.381
That I did.
And you said...

41:03.449 --> 41:05.850
"I assume that means yes."

41:49.395 --> 41:51.362
Excuse me, sir,
you dropped that.

41:51.430 --> 41:52.463
No, I didn't.

41:52.531 --> 41:54.265
<i>Yes,</i> you did.

42:06.278 --> 42:08.646
<i>Michael, someone is trying</i>
<i>to have killed in here.</i>

42:08.714 --> 42:09.981
<i>On the back of this note,</i>

42:10.049 --> 42:11.616
<i>you'll find</i>
<i>the name and address</i>

42:11.684 --> 42:13.284
<i>of a guard who's working</i>
<i>with them.</i>

42:13.352 --> 42:14.986
<i>Do what you can.</i>

42:15.054 --> 42:16.265
<i>Please hurry.</i>
