00:01.568 --> 00:03.468
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:03.536 --> 00:05.026
<i>Tool Time!</i>

00:05.105 --> 00:09.405
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:09.476 --> 00:12.707
[cheering]

00:18.585 --> 00:20.746
Thank you, Heidi.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.685
Thank you very much.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.384
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l'm Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor</i>

00:25.458 --> 00:27.619
and you all know my assistant,
Al Borland.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.957
- [applause]
- How are you doin'?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.158
Thanks for the ride.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.258
Maybe next time
you'll kick in for gas.

00:35.335 --> 00:38.361
All right. Great to be back.
First show this season.

00:38.438 --> 00:42.067
l've got some big news.
Somebody on the show's pregnant.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.632
[chuckling]

00:43.710 --> 00:45.974
Al, when are you expecting?

00:48.048 --> 00:51.211
Actually, it's Heidi
who's expecting a bundle of joy.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.046
That's right, our little Heidi.

00:53.119 --> 00:56.646
<i>Just married, soon to be Tool Time mom,
give her a round of applause.</i>

00:56.723 --> 00:59.283
[applause]

01:01.528 --> 01:04.190
Good to be back with a big show.
lt's a two-parter.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.164
<i>We're doing our Tool Time salute...</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:07.893
[motor revving]

01:08.701 --> 01:11.670
- ...to engines, big and small.
- That's right.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.367
Today we're gonna show you a couple
examples of some smaller engines.

01:15.442 --> 01:19.173
<i>ln the next segment, the Navy's
invited us aboard the USS Constellation,</i>

01:19.245 --> 01:22.806
the aircraft carrier,
to see some big motors. Oh, yeah.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.750
Actually, they invited me and Heidi.
We had to beg them to let Tim come.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.120
[hissing]

01:31.357 --> 01:33.825
Let's get back to small engines.
Look at this.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.724
lt's a Conley 427.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.423
Smallest four-stroke
production V-8 in the world.

01:38.498 --> 01:42.059
Beautifully detailed, four-bolt mains,
and runs in a car like this.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.398
- Start her up, Al.
- [starts engine]

01:46.139 --> 01:47.800
[revving engine]

01:51.778 --> 01:53.678
l bet there's people out there going,

01:53.746 --> 01:56.681
''That's the smallest engine
in the world''.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.216
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

01:58.284 --> 01:59.308
[both] Wrong.

01:59.385 --> 02:03.287
The smallest engine in the world is on
the smallest automobile in the world,

02:03.356 --> 02:05.119
the Denso Micro-Car.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.557
Marv, you want to come in here
a little closer?

02:07.627 --> 02:10.960
lt took 20 people four years
to assemble this bad boy.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.160
[Al] lt's an actual working car
the size of a grain of rice.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.393
[Tim] Look at her go.

02:18.571 --> 02:21.039
A little more speed
it'll be the lead car

02:21.107 --> 02:24.406
in the Uncle Ben's 500 this year.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.308
- Let's take a closer look.
- Tim...

02:26.379 --> 02:29.143
- They're not around.
- They're very delicate.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.012
- Don't pick it up.
- Hey!

02:34.254 --> 02:37.690
That is what l call a compact car.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.746
Hey. We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.293
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Mom.

03:55.368 --> 03:58.428
Well, l got you everything you'll need
to start school.

03:58.504 --> 04:02.770
Backpacks, notebooks, paper,
pens, highlighters.

04:02.842 --> 04:06.369
- Anything else you need?
- Someone to go and pretend to be me.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.308
Randy, you must be looking forward
to starting high school.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.753
Yeah, this sleeping in late and having
fun all day is getting on my nerves.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.713
You should be like Brad.
He can't wait to start.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.156
Yep, and right out there's
the reason why.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.791
They have every class together.

04:24.864 --> 04:28.027
Brad's even thinking about
joining the modern dance club.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.034
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

04:39.646 --> 04:43.810
So, you seem to be seeing
an awful lot of Angela.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.881
Yeah. She's great, isn't she?

04:46.953 --> 04:50.218
Yeah. She's great. She really...
She's... She's great.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.723
Yeah.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.021
But you know what l was thinking?

04:54.761 --> 04:58.720
A guy your age should be playing
the field, dating different girls.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.836
Nope. l found the one,
so what's the point?

05:08.608 --> 05:10.872
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Taylor.
- Hi.

05:10.943 --> 05:14.470
- Brad, l think l left my bag.
- Oh. Oh, here it is.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.442
- Here you go, Ang.
- Thanks, sweetie.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.124
l can't wait to go back to school.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.898
[Tim] lt's been pretty smooth so far.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.993
lf the landing's anything like this,
we might as well just take a nap.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.367
[screaming]

05:50.683 --> 05:52.742
<i>A little present from Tool Time.</i>

05:54.687 --> 05:56.154
- How was your flight?
- What?

05:56.222 --> 05:58.122
- How was your flight?
- Good, thanks.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.125
- Good.
- Tim, Captain Lloyd Jenkins.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.286
- Welcome aboard.
- Captain.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.853
<i>Well, Captain, think you're ready
for Tool Time?</i>

06:04.931 --> 06:07.263
Sure, Tim.
l think we're all prepared.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.542
<i>Welcome to Tool Time,</i>

06:22.615 --> 06:25.914
<i>coming to you from
the USS Constellation aircraft carrier.</i>

06:25.985 --> 06:29.716
<i>Thank you, Heidi, and welcome
to a special Tool Time salute...</i>

06:30.356 --> 06:32.381
- [plane taking off]
- ...to engines

06:32.458 --> 06:36.224
We're in the hangar bay of the ship
with the ship's captain, Lloyd Jenkins.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.854
- Thank you for having us on board.
- Our pleasure.

06:38.931 --> 06:42.958
Right behind me is the Navy's
most advanced fighter, the F-1 5.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.629
Actually, Tim, it's the F-1 8.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.196
Eighteen, 1 5... it's a number, isn't it?

06:48.808 --> 06:52.539
This baby sports twin low bypass
turbo engine fans

06:52.612 --> 06:56.104
with a 1 600 gallon
internal fuel capacity.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.673
- lsn't that right?
- That's exactly right.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.685
You seem to be an expert on the Navy.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.621
Well, sir, as a former Seabee
l like to keep my oars in the water.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.851
He was stationed in Nevada.

07:07.894 --> 07:11.796
The closest he ever got to the water
was the fountain at Caesars Palace.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.929
<i>Well, Captain, why don't you give us
information on the Constellation?</i>

07:17.003 --> 07:20.131
She's virtually a floating city, Al,
with a crew of 5,500.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.333
She's got her own post office
and hospital

07:22.408 --> 07:24.569
and serves over 1 8,000 meals a day.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.168
Now that Al's here, make that 1 9,000.

07:29.348 --> 07:33.580
<i>[whispering] We've just entered the
Constellation's combat direction center,</i>

07:33.653 --> 07:37.885
this carrier's state-of-the-art
mission control facility.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.517
These sailors have
a tremendous responsibility.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.585
When mine does that at home the cursor
has to be moved over to the left and in.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.063
<i>- [alarm sounding]
- [Tim] Whoa, whoa.</i>

07:47.166 --> 07:48.827
What did l do here?

07:48.901 --> 07:51.870
Tim, you just declared war on Finland.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.303
Huh?

07:53.406 --> 07:54.896
l'm ready to serve, sir.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.868
Just kidding, Al.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.912
When we found out Tim was coming
aboard we deactivated our weapons.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.345
Really.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.348
[speaking Spanish]

08:07.453 --> 08:10.889
[speaking Spanish]

08:10.957 --> 08:12.857
[chuckling] l think you just said,

08:12.925 --> 08:15.894
''The library's between the church
and the meatballs''.

08:16.796 --> 08:18.559
l thought that meant ''city hall''.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.395
No, l think ''city hall'' is...
[speaks Spanish].

08:21.501 --> 08:23.560
Let's ask your mom.
She knows Spanish.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.662
She's not home. Let's check
the dictionary on my computer.

08:26.739 --> 08:31.267
Or in Spanish...
[speaking Spanish]

08:33.246 --> 08:37.148
You just said, ''Let's go up and check
the dictionary on my gall bladder''.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.247
<i>This is the Constellation's
navigation bridge.</i>

08:45.324 --> 08:47.792
Al's scouting out the flight deck.
[clicks]

08:47.860 --> 08:50.021
Al, this is great, isn't it?

08:50.096 --> 08:53.623
- Roger that, Tim.
- Marv, follow me back here.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.963
Excuse me while l show them
the equipment.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.799
A lot of impressive buttons.
Sure they have safeties,

08:58.905 --> 09:02.170
- so you can't accidentally turn one...
- [alarm sounding]

09:02.775 --> 09:04.470
What have l done, Captain?

09:04.544 --> 09:08.002
You've just activated
the firefighting wash-down system

09:08.080 --> 09:09.445
for the entire flight deck.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.575
[Al] Tim! Tim, stop playing
with all those buttons!

09:12.652 --> 09:14.119
lnteresting.

09:16.789 --> 09:17.813
[hissing sound]

09:17.890 --> 09:19.755
This is our diesel engine room, Tim.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.122
[banging on pipe]

09:24.897 --> 09:28.663
Tim, on a ship, like in a basement,
you might want to watch your head.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.833
This is a ten-cylinder,

09:33.906 --> 09:38.741
1 340 horsepower, at 720 RPM,
diesel engine.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.507
lt's a generator.
lt's a back-up generator!

09:41.581 --> 09:44.744
You put some blades on this,
this baby will mow a lawn!

09:44.817 --> 09:46.580
[grunting]

09:48.154 --> 09:50.918
A whole series of steam
channels over this...

09:52.658 --> 09:54.387
Hello, Tim.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.256
You remember Al Borland.
Hi, Al.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.201
Did you start the engine segment
without me?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.429
Yes, l did.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.097
And l'm certainly sorry to...
[snickering]

10:07.206 --> 10:08.639
...burst your bubble.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.473
l think this will be great.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.380
What l want to do is set a camera up
here and shoot back in this direction

10:17.450 --> 10:19.350
<i>so we can show the Tool Time audience</i>

10:19.418 --> 10:22.182
how you guys test the engine
on an F-1 4 Tomcat.

10:22.254 --> 10:26.156
lt's a good idea but it'll have to wait.
l'm busy the next couple of hours.

10:26.225 --> 10:29.353
- What do you have to do?
- l'm heading down to the mess deck.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.955
Guys from catapult maintenance
are throwing Heidi a baby shower.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.366
A baby shower?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.496
Wow.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.801
This is the new Navy.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.906
Hi. l was just on my way out.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.408
So l can't stay and talk.
l love your hair. Bye.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.310
Angela, l'll call you later.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.720
So, um, Mom, what are you doing home?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.716
My class was cancelled.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.258
What do you have to say for yourself?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.821
Well, your hair does
look kind of good right now.

11:42.802 --> 11:46.363
Brad, what were you doing
with a girl in your bedroom?

11:47.740 --> 11:49.367
Um... nothing.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.070
When l walked in
it didn't look like nothing.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.305
You wouldn't have seen it
if you'd knocked.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.474
Don't get smart. You are not allowed
to have a girl in your room

11:57.550 --> 11:58.608
when we're not home!

11:58.684 --> 12:01.710
Now she'll probably never come back,
thanks to you!

12:01.787 --> 12:04.153
Excuse me.
You have a girl on your bed,

12:04.223 --> 12:06.589
l catch you and l'm the bad guy?

12:06.692 --> 12:09.252
- Mom, l didn't do anything wrong.
- Really?

12:09.328 --> 12:12.024
What would have happened
if l hadn't come home then?

12:12.098 --> 12:13.326
None of your business.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.959
You think l'm gonna talk to you
about my sex life?

12:19.405 --> 12:20.963
[whispering] Sex life?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.946
When you test the F-1 4 Tomcat motor,
you control it from here?

12:30.015 --> 12:32.279
- Where's the throttle?
- lt's right there.

12:32.351 --> 12:36.048
That's an awful lot of power.
Please try not to touch that.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.454
<i>- [cell phone ringing]
- Excuse me a second.</i>

12:39.458 --> 12:40.755

Hi, Jill.
Yeah. Just a second.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.226
Excuse me. ls everything OK?

12:46.298 --> 12:50.064
Not really.
l think Brad might be having sex.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.636
- Sex?
- [loud whirring]

13:12.224 --> 13:14.089
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.530
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.794
- Remember this afternoon.
- l know, Mom. l'm grounded.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.028
l'll be home after school,
3:06 on the dot.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.626
All right.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.269
- l'm gonna be late today.
- Where are you going?

13:29.341 --> 13:32.310
- l'm going to David's house.
- Estimated time of return?

13:32.411 --> 13:34.345
- 5:30?
- Reason for visit?

13:34.413 --> 13:35.971
Gambling and devil worship.

13:41.353 --> 13:45.119
Don't take this Brad thing out on me.
l haven't had a girl in my room yet.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.453
Yet?

13:46.525 --> 13:47.856
l gotta go.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.858
- Jill?
- Oh! l'm so glad you're home.

13:56.635 --> 13:59.331
- Hi.
- Not quite as glad as the Navy.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.104
l missed you.
All right, what's the deal with Brad?

14:05.211 --> 14:07.509
l wish l knew.
lt's time to talk to him

14:07.580 --> 14:10.879
- and find out how far this has gone.
- Roger that.

14:10.950 --> 14:14.044
lt's important to pinpoint the
problem and pull no punches.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.644
- Glad you feel that way.
- Tell me how it works out.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.383
Hey!

14:18.991 --> 14:21.016
You'll be the one dealing with this.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.584
- Me?
- Yes! You're the father.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.130
Why don't we just get him a book
or something?

14:27.333 --> 14:30.302
Tim, this requires an actual discussion.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.633
lt's not like
when we were potty training him

14:32.705 --> 14:36.971
<i>- and we could just read a book.
- l loved that book, Everybody Poops.</i>

14:41.380 --> 14:44.508
Look, l tried to talk to him.
He would not talk to me.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.552
lf he's gonna open up to anybody
it's gonna be you.

14:47.620 --> 14:51.181
- What am l supposed to say?
- Find out what's going on first of all.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.851
Then talk to him about maturity,

14:54.927 --> 14:58.090
responsibility and safety.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.495
Maturity, responsibility, safety.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.932
Are you sure
l'm the right person for this?

15:12.278 --> 15:15.008
[plastic bag rustling]

15:21.253 --> 15:23.949
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Dad. Do we still have a Navy?

15:25.424 --> 15:28.291
You do. l'm not sure
they'd defend me at this point.

15:29.128 --> 15:32.291
- All right. See ya.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.730
ls there anything
you'd like to ask me?

15:34.800 --> 15:35.892
No.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.833
Are you sure?

15:38.437 --> 15:41.406
- Yeah.
- Well, if you got any questions...

15:42.608 --> 15:44.235
...just holler.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.574
- OK. Thanks, Dad.
- Any time day or night.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.580
- All right. Thanks.
- Call me at work if you want.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.781
[sighing]
That was easy.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.079
[Wilson] Hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.319
Mm-hmm.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.790
What are you doing, Wilson?

16:04.863 --> 16:07.297
Well, Tim, l'm admiring my yams.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.233
Should l leave you alone?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.803
No, no, no, no, no, Tim.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.037
See, l'm a charter member
of the tuber-of-the-month club.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.675
Did you realize that in New Guinea
a family is judged

16:22.748 --> 16:24.716
by the quality of the yams
they grow?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.981
A father passes down
his yam-growing skills to his children.

16:30.222 --> 16:32.713
Well, l just gave Brad the big sex talk.

16:35.527 --> 16:38.189
l don't think he's ready
for the big yam talk yet.

16:39.631 --> 16:42.156
l thought you discussed
birds and bees years ago.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.394
l did.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.700
But the bee's found a honey
and he's gone a bit cuckoo.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.300
Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.071
You seem quite at ease about it.

16:52.144 --> 16:56.513
l must say, l'm very impressed you can
speak openly to Brad about, you know...

16:56.615 --> 16:57.877
- Sex.
- Mm-hmm.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.383
[both chuckling]

17:00.152 --> 17:02.848
lt was a snap.
lt was over in a couple seconds.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.183
Seconds?

17:04.256 --> 17:07.089
l just said,
''lf you got any questions, just holler''.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.393
And?

17:11.096 --> 17:13.257
And l avoided the issue.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.198
l said nothing
and l blew the whole thing.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.567
Well, maybe you should just try again.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.130
You're right.
l just want to say the right thing.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.166
lf l mess up and turn him off,
l'm afraid he'll never come to me again.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.610
You know, that reminds me

17:28.680 --> 17:31.649
of my old friend and pinochle
partner, Hubert Humphrey.

17:33.085 --> 17:37.044
He said, ''All you have to do
is be yourself

17:37.122 --> 17:39.818
and speak from your heart
and your guts''.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.020
Unfortunately, l left most of my guts
on an aircraft carrier.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.824
Your heart is in the right place.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.128
No. The second landing
it shifted to the left just a scoshe.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.067
[chuckling] Tim, l think
you'll do just fine.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.798
- You're a good friend, Wilson.
- l yam what l yam.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.514
Hey, Brad!

18:05.617 --> 18:06.948
Yeah, Dad?

18:08.620 --> 18:10.053
[Tim exhaling]

18:11.290 --> 18:12.621
Uh...

18:13.625 --> 18:16.355
- You want to work on the hot rod?
- Sure.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.588
Great.

18:18.931 --> 18:23.163
All right. Put your gloves on.
l'm gonna try to tack this firewall up.

18:23.235 --> 18:26.204
So, how long you think
it's gonna take to finish the hot rod?

18:26.305 --> 18:29.274
l don't know.
l don't want to rush into it.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.673
The important things in life
you don't want to rush into.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.042
Especially when it comes
to cars and tools

18:35.114 --> 18:37.582
you want to take your time
and do things right.

18:37.649 --> 18:41.016
Exactly. But that rule
doesn't just apply to cars and tools.

18:41.086 --> 18:44.317
You also want to take your time
when you're gonna have...

18:44.389 --> 18:45.754
...food.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.522
- What do you mean?
- You know that Polish smorgasbord?

18:53.599 --> 18:55.624
You don't go right up to Olga and say,

18:55.701 --> 18:59.193
''l want all the kielbasa
and all the sauerkraut right now''.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.829
[chuckling] You do!

19:02.074 --> 19:04.770
All right. Bad example, bad example.
Football.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.777
You don't go right in and try to score.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.541
- You don't?
- ln football you do. You do.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.307
Gardening, gardening, think gardening.

19:13.385 --> 19:16.286
You don't plant your flower
unless your bed's made.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.323
No. No, no, no!

19:24.096 --> 19:26.963
Maybe it's me. l have no clue
what you're trying to say.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.363
lt isn't just you.

19:32.604 --> 19:36.062
- l wanna talk about you and Angela.
- There's nothing to talk about.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.371
- l want to talk about sex.
- l don't want...

19:38.443 --> 19:41.071
l want you to listen to me, please.
Listen up.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.011
Sex is, um...

19:43.081 --> 19:44.571
lt's like a car.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.117
The best idea

19:46.185 --> 19:50.519
is to keep the car in the garage
for a long, long, long time.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.461
And then, somewhere in the future,
the distant future,

19:56.562 --> 19:58.393
when that garage door opens,

19:58.463 --> 20:01.364
you gotta think, ''car cover''.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.038
Look, Dad, l know about safe sex.
There's nothing to worry about.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.205
lf you're having sex there is.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.148
l'm not having sex.
Not with Angela, not with anybody.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.051
l know that. That's good.
Of course not.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.156
So, Dad, how old were you
your first time?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.525
What?

20:32.297 --> 20:33.730
Uh... 37.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.828
l thought you wanted
to have a real talk.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.903
Well, l was a few years older than you.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.242
But l was still way too young.
l knew nothing about women.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.607
- You didn't?
- l knew the mechanics of it.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.880
But l didn't realize how much
responsibility was involved

20:54.953 --> 20:57.615
in having an intimate relationship
with girls.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.384
Wow.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.689
l never heard you talk like this before.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.253
Well, it's kind of hard for me
to talk about stuff like this with you.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.300
lt's hard for me to talk
about stuff like this with Mom.

21:10.535 --> 21:13.993
But we opened a line of communication
and l want to keep it that way.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.701
Some guys l hang out with think
that by having sex it makes you a man.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.539
l used to think that, too.

21:19.645 --> 21:23.877
But l think the truth is, you should
be a man first and then think about sex.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.746
So, what do you think?
How many years away am l?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.850
Well... there's no set number of years.

21:34.660 --> 21:38.357
- When will l know when l'm a man?
- Your mom and l will tell you.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.874
So, how are you feeling?

21:49.941 --> 21:51.568
Oh, fat.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.445
Just hope you never get pregnant.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.315
- l think you look great.
- Thank you.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.849
Heidi, here's a tip.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.579
When it comes time for diapers,
l recommend cloth.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.712
- Really?
- Softer on a baby's bottom.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.723
But disposables are so convenient.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.259
Ladies, trying to do a show here!

22:09.061 --> 22:10.824
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Mr. Taylor.
