WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.434
What gadget do you have
for us today, al?

00:03.435 --> 00:07.973
Well, tim, I think I have
an interesting item.

00:07.974 --> 00:12.744
A light bulb
that is guaranteed
to last 100 years.

00:12.745 --> 00:14.746
Al, that's... That's
not really that new.

00:14.747 --> 00:16.547
It's been around
quite awhile.

00:16.548 --> 00:20.719
Well, perhaps,
but this is guaranteed
to last 100 years,

00:20.720 --> 00:25.724
And I have a certificate...
To prove it.

00:25.725 --> 00:29.527
<i>(scoffs)</i> how do you know
the company will be around
a hundred years?

00:33.899 --> 00:35.634
Well...

00:35.635 --> 00:36.735
Uh...

00:36.736 --> 00:39.804
Someone will be held
responsible.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.806
How many of these
did you buy?
Well, tim, I...

00:41.807 --> 00:43.742
<i>(crash)</i>

00:49.849 --> 00:51.783
Just that one.

00:53.119 --> 00:56.087
And they said it was good
for a hundred years.

00:56.088 --> 00:57.421
<i>(♪ theme music starts)</i>

00:57.422 --> 00:58.990
Ah! There's the theme music.

00:58.991 --> 01:00.992
You know what time
that means it is.

01:00.993 --> 01:04.595
Time to hear another word
from binford about some of
their fine new products.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.531
That's right.

01:06.532 --> 01:09.267
I'd like to introduce you
to binford's small line
of industrial magnets.

01:09.268 --> 01:14.438
The minimag 100
is perfect for picking up
screws and nails.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.207
It can also pick up
small tools

01:16.208 --> 01:18.509
That have
carelessly been dropped
behind the workbench,

01:18.510 --> 01:20.679
Perhaps the fault
of a coworker.

01:24.016 --> 01:26.918
And the minimag 2000.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.853
Small but powerful.

01:28.854 --> 01:31.856
Ten pounds will pick up
400 pounds.

01:31.857 --> 01:35.060
This would suck the tin man
right through a keyhole.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.029
Well, it was designed
to pick up sheet metal,

01:38.030 --> 01:39.898
So you'll want
to keep it pointed...

01:39.899 --> 01:41.833
Tim...

01:43.635 --> 01:46.504
No, no. Just slide it
straight down.

01:50.309 --> 01:52.276
Tim...

01:55.247 --> 01:57.615
Pretty powerful
little thing, isn't it?

01:57.616 --> 01:59.818
<i>(feedback)</i>

02:03.455 --> 02:05.223
Marv, pull it back! Marv!

02:05.224 --> 02:06.725
Oh!

02:11.663 --> 02:14.999
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford.

03:24.036 --> 03:25.970
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:30.309 --> 03:32.277
All right, all right, all right.
Guys, attention on deck.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.578
I got all the snacks ready
for the game of the century.

03:34.579 --> 03:36.981
The pistons versus the bulls.
Michael jordan, isiah thomas.

03:36.982 --> 03:38.716
Oh, oh.
<i>(horn)</i>

03:38.717 --> 03:39.951
Ah!

03:39.952 --> 03:41.286
What'd you get?
All right.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.753
Cheese nutrition.

03:42.754 --> 03:47.292
Cheese doodles,
cheese oodles, cheese curls,

03:47.293 --> 03:49.127
Cheese puffs -

03:49.128 --> 03:51.296
Teeth-stainin',
artery-blockin'
stomach-bloatin'...

03:51.297 --> 03:54.765
<i>(grunts)</i>

03:54.766 --> 03:56.267
Gee, no dessert?
Yes.

03:56.268 --> 03:58.236
Cheesecake.

04:00.172 --> 04:01.639
You want to join us?

04:01.640 --> 04:05.276
You know I'd love to,
but my jock is in the wash.

04:05.277 --> 04:06.577
Would you come out
in the garage?

04:06.578 --> 04:07.812
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

04:07.813 --> 04:10.215
She just can't
get enough of me.
Nope.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.749
What's up?

04:11.750 --> 04:13.784
My computer crashed.

04:13.785 --> 04:17.154
I gotta go to work today
and recreate all of the research
for next week's lead article.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.089
It means I can't take mark
to the ballet.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.959
Mark was really looking forward
to going to <i>swan lake</i> with you.

04:20.959 --> 04:21.959
What are you gonna do?

04:21.961 --> 04:23.361
Gonna get you to do it.

04:23.362 --> 04:24.996
Me?
Yeah.

04:24.997 --> 04:28.499
Back the tutu up, honey.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.368
Honey, you have to.
No. <i>(whistles)</i>

04:30.369 --> 04:33.104
I already had to miss
that cub scout pancake thing

04:33.105 --> 04:34.672
A week ago
because of work.

04:34.673 --> 04:36.174
I don't want to
disappoint him again.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.576
Ask karen.
I did. Karen's busy.

04:38.577 --> 04:41.246
Everybody is busy.
She suggested you.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.947
No, absolutely not.

04:42.948 --> 04:45.816
Tim, look, mark has really been
looking forward to this

04:45.817 --> 04:47.685
Ever since he saw
<i>the nutcracker</i> on tv.

04:47.686 --> 04:49.287
It really means a lot to him.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.356
Give him a ticket
and call him a cab.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.558
Tim!
He can take my car.

04:54.559 --> 04:58.296
Put a pillow on there,
he'll look like grandma,
with just his knuckles showing.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.497
"I can't see anything."

04:59.498 --> 05:01.732
Tim, you know,
you might enjoy this.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.502
It's a great story. It's about
the power of undying love.

05:04.503 --> 05:07.505
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Boy meets bird.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.540
Boy loses bird.

05:09.541 --> 05:12.510
Boy pan fries bird.
<i>(sizzle sounds)</i>

05:12.511 --> 05:15.346
Not exactly.
It's about this princess
and her friends.

05:15.347 --> 05:16.680
They're hanging out
at the lake.

05:16.681 --> 05:18.349
And this evil sorcerer...
<i>(snoring)</i>

05:18.350 --> 05:21.652
...Comes along and turns
them all into swans.

05:21.653 --> 05:26.690
Well, then, the prince,
ziegfried, comes along
to hunt the swans -

05:26.691 --> 05:30.161
Weapons, bows and arrows -

05:30.162 --> 05:32.997
And the princess says,
"please, I'm not a swan.

05:32.998 --> 05:36.367
I'm really just a person.
Don't kill me."

05:36.368 --> 05:39.770
So it's a swan
with an identity crisis.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.908
Ok. Let's try another story.

05:43.909 --> 05:48.079
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful,
lovely and talented queen

05:48.080 --> 05:51.082
Who was married
to an evil king -

05:51.083 --> 05:52.783
The king selfish.

05:52.784 --> 05:54.419
Mmm, I'm gonna like this guy.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.254
Yeah, you would
like this guy.

05:56.255 --> 05:59.457
He has a low-rated tool show
where most of the work
is done by his assistant,

05:59.458 --> 06:00.825
The earl of al.

06:03.095 --> 06:07.598
Anyway, our kind and sensitive
and breathtakingly beautiful
queen

06:07.599 --> 06:10.335
Wanted a knight
in shining armor

06:10.336 --> 06:12.503
To come and take
the young princeling

06:12.504 --> 06:14.839
To the palace
dance festival.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.608
I hate ballet. I hate it.

06:17.609 --> 06:20.711
You go to the ballet, you burp,
people are going, "shh, quiet!"

06:20.712 --> 06:23.014
<i>(hissing)</i> "shh!"

06:23.015 --> 06:25.316
Tim, I took those kids
to the monster truck rally
for you.

06:25.317 --> 06:26.550
Do you remember that?
Uh-huh.

06:26.551 --> 06:29.387
Ten to one, no one there went,
"hey, lady! Quiet!

06:29.388 --> 06:31.622
You're burping!
I can't hear fordzilla!"

06:31.623 --> 06:32.991
<i>(truck sound)</i>

06:35.127 --> 06:37.428
All right, all right,
all right. I'll take him.

06:37.429 --> 06:40.131
I'll tape the game
on ye old royal vcr.

06:40.132 --> 06:42.700
Thank you.

06:42.701 --> 06:45.569
You are my favorite knight.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.972
And later on,
I'll make sure you
have your favorite night.

06:49.574 --> 06:51.609
<i>(grunts)</i>

06:53.712 --> 06:55.679
Now remember,
if this doesn't work out,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.615
I'm not gonna be able
to leave you alone again.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.850
Mom, don't worry about us.
We can handle it.

06:59.851 --> 07:02.053
Well, good. 'cause, you know,
I'd like to be able to leave you

07:02.054 --> 07:03.854
For a few hours
in the middle of the day

07:03.855 --> 07:05.556
And know that you guys
are gonna be ok.

07:05.557 --> 07:06.790
You can!

07:06.791 --> 07:09.060
Are you gonna call
before you come home?

07:09.061 --> 07:11.929
Why are you asking me that?

07:11.930 --> 07:13.564
No reason.

07:13.565 --> 07:15.099
Yeah, right.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.435
I think that you should know

07:17.436 --> 07:19.937
That I could be home
at any moment.

07:19.938 --> 07:23.007
Now, wilson is gonna
be next door the whole time

07:23.008 --> 07:24.575
If you need anything.

07:24.576 --> 07:26.411
And here are the emergency
numbers right here.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.679
We know, we know.
We call them all the time
for dad.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.148
Yeah.

07:37.322 --> 07:39.623
They're handsome.

07:39.624 --> 07:41.559
They're virile.

07:43.295 --> 07:45.696
They even changed
their underwear.

07:45.697 --> 07:48.999
So what, you're wearing his,
he's wearing yours?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.901
<i>(high-pitched voice)</i>
and his are a little tight.

07:50.902 --> 07:53.837
<i>(laughs)</i> but
they're so attractive.
Oh, you all look great.

07:53.838 --> 07:56.307
Hey, dad.
Have fun at <i>swine lake.</i>

07:56.308 --> 07:58.443
<i>(snorting)</i>

07:58.444 --> 08:00.744
You guys are just jealous
because you don't get to
dress up

08:00.745 --> 08:02.480
And look cool like mark and I.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.782
Now listen, I want you guys
to have fun.

08:04.783 --> 08:08.018
But, mark, this is
a grown-up place,

08:08.019 --> 08:10.020
And I want you to be
on your best behavior.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.823
And remember, tim,
this is a grown-up place,

08:12.824 --> 08:15.393
And I want you to be
on your best behavior.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.728
We know it's a cultural event.
We'll make you real proud.

08:17.729 --> 08:18.896
All right.

08:18.897 --> 08:20.164
Hey, lady!
You in the beak!

08:20.165 --> 08:22.666
<i>(horn)</i>

08:22.667 --> 08:25.403
Nice jump!
Go, swans, go!

08:25.404 --> 08:28.072
<i>(both)</i> go, swans, go!
Go, swans, go!

08:28.073 --> 08:30.674
Hey, wilson.
Hi-ho, tim.

08:30.675 --> 08:34.345
Well, my, my, my,
don't you look spiffy
for the ballet today.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.813
You heading out?
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, we are.

08:36.815 --> 08:38.282
Keep a close watch
on these guys, will you?

08:38.283 --> 08:40.851
And thanks
very much for doing it.
You should see us about 5:00.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.087
Mm, anytime.
Boy, it's too bad
you're busy today.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.956
I've got two free tickets
to the pistons/bulls game.

08:45.957 --> 08:47.891
Oh!

08:47.892 --> 08:49.693
Ohh!

08:49.694 --> 08:51.629
It's a shame. First row.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.164
No!
Mm-hmm. Courtside.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.367
No way! Courtside?

08:56.368 --> 08:59.003
Let me just
take a look at them.

08:59.004 --> 09:01.572
This is down...
These are right behind
the players' bench.

09:01.573 --> 09:04.074
How did you get these?
Radio call-in contest.

09:04.075 --> 09:06.144
They asked the name
of the astronomer

09:06.145 --> 09:08.946
Famous for his three laws
describing the motion
of the planets around the sun,

09:08.947 --> 09:13.484
And I was the 15th caller
that knew that it was,
indeed, johannes kepler.

09:13.485 --> 09:17.655
There were 14 other people
that knew that?

09:17.656 --> 09:18.856
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:18.857 --> 09:22.226
Boy, these are just...
These are just unbelieve...

09:22.227 --> 09:24.094
Oh, man.

09:24.095 --> 09:26.096
I mean, once in a lifetime,
you get to sit back there
with those play...

09:26.097 --> 09:27.831
Mm-hmm.
<i>(mumbles)</i>

09:29.801 --> 09:32.203
I'd give my left arm
for these.
Mm-hmm. Well, it's a shame.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.372
I'll just have
to throw them out.
Oh! Don't throw them out.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.773
Don't throw them out.
I think I...

09:35.774 --> 09:38.142
I gotta find somebody...
Somebody to use those tickets.

09:38.143 --> 09:39.677
Here you go.
Hey, thanks.

09:39.678 --> 09:42.079
Oh, my pleasure.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.682
Dad, you ready to go
to the ballet?
Let's go to that ballet.

09:44.683 --> 09:48.052
Come over here, quick,
quick, quick, quick!

09:48.053 --> 09:49.687
All right,
you know what these are?

09:49.688 --> 09:53.023
These are courtside seats
to the pistons/bulls game.

09:53.024 --> 09:55.993
We'd sit so close,
they might ask us to play.

09:55.994 --> 09:58.162
Wow!
Darn right.
Well, you want to go?

09:58.163 --> 10:00.764
No. I want to see the swans.

10:00.765 --> 10:03.934
<i>(laughs)</i> maybe you
didn't hear me.

10:03.935 --> 10:07.538
Courtside. Right up front.
Michael jordan.

10:07.539 --> 10:09.240
Won't mom be disappointed?

10:09.241 --> 10:11.141
Yeah, yeah,
she would, wouldn't she?

10:11.142 --> 10:13.143
Don't wanna
disappoint her. Oh.

10:13.144 --> 10:16.080
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We might be able to do both.

10:16.081 --> 10:18.749
That ballet starts about
12:45, 1:00, doesn't it?

10:18.750 --> 10:21.819
Tip off's at two.
Perfect. Perfect.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.987
Will the ballet be over
by two?

10:23.988 --> 10:25.389
Not over over.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.191
Most of the ballet's
the first 20 minutes, anyway.

10:27.192 --> 10:29.393
After that, the real dancers
get tired, and they send in -

10:29.394 --> 10:31.495
The second string
goes in and dances.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.497
I don't know.

10:33.498 --> 10:35.165
Come on. All right, um...

10:35.166 --> 10:37.201
All the hotdogs
and soda you want.

10:37.202 --> 10:39.270
I don't think so.
All right, all right.

10:39.271 --> 10:41.171
I'll buy you one of those
big foam fingers.

10:41.172 --> 10:42.373
Really?
Yeah.

10:42.374 --> 10:44.308
Wow! Let's go!
All right!

10:48.347 --> 10:51.616
Hey, randy, check it out.
I found mom's stash of cookies.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.952
Turn on the game.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.954
I will. I will.

10:58.857 --> 11:00.591
After...

11:00.592 --> 11:03.527
I smoke my cigar.

11:05.163 --> 11:08.633
Whoa, cool.
Where did you get that?

11:08.634 --> 11:11.335
Dad's sock drawer.
He's got a whole box.

11:11.336 --> 11:14.405
That's why his socks
smell so bad.

11:14.406 --> 11:19.009
No. I think that's why
this cigar smells so bad.

11:19.010 --> 11:22.346
Well, let's smoke it.
How do you light it?

11:22.347 --> 11:25.483
I think you're supposed
to bite off the end first.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.494
Well, you're not
supposed to eat it.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.962
<i>(coughs)</i>

11:38.963 --> 11:41.565
Just light the cigar.
Not in here. It smells.

11:41.566 --> 11:43.501
Outside.
Ok.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.773
Wait a minute.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.776
Cigars and cookies.
<i>(sniffs)</i> we're men.

11:54.879 --> 11:56.880
<i>(coughs)</i>

12:03.288 --> 12:06.023
Hey, does your mouth
still taste nasty?

12:06.024 --> 12:09.993
Yeah. It tastes like
chocolate chip cookies
and dad's socks.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.865
Whoo! You still
smell like smoke.

12:14.866 --> 12:17.134
Spray me with that
air freshener again.

12:17.135 --> 12:20.270
Brad, randy,
where'd you guys go?!

12:20.271 --> 12:21.271
Hey.

12:21.272 --> 12:23.841
Dad's here.
Quick, hide the can.

12:28.780 --> 12:29.780
Hi, dad.
Hi, dad.

12:29.781 --> 12:31.716
Hey, guys.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.885
Well, congratulations.
The house is in one piece.
Thank you.

12:34.886 --> 12:37.788
And you thought
you couldn't trust us.

12:37.789 --> 12:39.323
Hm. What's that smell?

12:39.324 --> 12:41.859
It's a new cologne
jennifer gave me.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.795
Ehh! I'd take it back.
It smells like air freshener.

12:44.796 --> 12:46.497
Well, can we go
to billy's?

12:46.498 --> 12:48.966
Yeah. I'll call you
for dinner.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.768
Bye, dad.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.136
Love you, dad. Bye.

12:58.276 --> 13:00.578
Dad, the game was great.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.613
You bet it was.
Courtside, front row,
you and me.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.549
That's the way
to see b-ball.
Yeah.

13:05.550 --> 13:09.119
Do you think that referee's
still mad at you?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.888
He knows I was just
stretching my legs.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.823
I wasn't trying to trip him.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.926
You know, dad, I liked
the basketball game

13:15.927 --> 13:17.595
A lot better than the ballet.

13:17.596 --> 13:20.063
Oh, that's exactly
what you do not want
to say to your mom.

13:20.064 --> 13:22.366
Why not?

13:22.367 --> 13:25.168
Because she wanted you to go
to the ballet. You wanted
to go to the ballet.

13:25.169 --> 13:28.372
And I don't think she's gonna
be all that happy about us
going to the basketball game.

13:28.373 --> 13:30.274
You said she'd be all for it.

13:30.275 --> 13:34.211
I say strange things
when I got courtside tickets
right in my hand.

13:34.212 --> 13:38.081
The truth is, we are going
to be in a lot of trouble.

13:38.082 --> 13:40.317
What are we gonna do?
We can't lie.

13:40.318 --> 13:42.252
We're not going to lie to her.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.189
We just gotta tell her
in the right way...

13:46.190 --> 13:48.859
You know, I'll tell her later.
We're just delaying the truth.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.961
<i>(door opens)</i>

13:50.962 --> 13:52.797
Oh, hi, guys!
Hey, hey.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.768
So, how did
brad and randy do?

13:57.769 --> 13:59.269
Brad and ran...
Oh, they did great.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.938
The house is good.
They're at billy's.

14:00.939 --> 14:03.441
So how was the ballet?
It was wonderful.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.742
Yeah? Did you
enjoy it, mark?

14:04.743 --> 14:06.243
He loved it!

14:06.244 --> 14:08.879
Did you, mark?
Every bit of it.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.715
Would you let mark answer?
What did you think about it?

14:11.716 --> 14:15.319
Wasn't it a great stor...
What is this? You got
some mustard on your shirt?

14:15.320 --> 14:16.921
We had hot dogs
at halftime.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.389
At intermission,
you had hot dogs.

14:24.429 --> 14:25.863
Maybe you should
go change that shirt

14:25.864 --> 14:28.799
And get
that mustard out of there
before it sets in the stain.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.068
Since when do they serve
hot dogs at intermission?

14:31.069 --> 14:33.437
It's children's day today.

14:33.438 --> 14:35.238
They had hot dogs, bratwurst,

14:35.239 --> 14:37.240
You know, nachos
with that drippy cheese
and everything,

14:37.241 --> 14:39.376
And, um... Uh, swan cookies.

14:45.149 --> 14:46.750
Tim, why do I
get the feeling

14:46.751 --> 14:48.652
That you did not
go to the ballet today?

14:48.653 --> 14:50.220
<i>(scoffs)</i> that's stupid.

14:50.221 --> 14:52.222
I brought the program home.
It's right there.

14:52.223 --> 14:55.960
Oh. Oh, gee, it is.

14:57.428 --> 14:59.096
Well, so, what did you
think of it?

14:59.097 --> 15:01.599
What did I think?
It was...

15:01.600 --> 15:04.869
It was tragic
and breathtaking.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.069
Really?

15:06.070 --> 15:08.772
One of the most beloved
ballets of all time.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.244
Here's what robert baker
of <i>detroit arts magazine</i>

15:14.245 --> 15:17.381
Has to say about this,
"tragic and breathtaking.

15:17.382 --> 15:20.885
One of the most beloved
ballets of all time."

15:23.655 --> 15:26.456
What are the odds?
You know...

15:29.227 --> 15:30.794
...That he and I
would have the same opinion?

15:30.795 --> 15:32.596
You know, that's...
<i>(laughs)</i>

15:32.597 --> 15:35.699
You didn't go to the ballet,
did you?
Yes, I did.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.902
Then how does it end?

15:37.903 --> 15:40.604
The audience wakes up
and stumbles to their car.

15:47.178 --> 15:50.280
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, no.

15:50.281 --> 15:53.984
So they sold this
right alongside
the little swan cookies,

15:53.985 --> 15:55.285
Is that right?

15:55.286 --> 15:57.021
Um, wilson gave me

15:57.022 --> 16:00.290
Some tickets to
the basketball game
just before I left.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.325
So you went there instead.

16:02.326 --> 16:04.695
No. Actually,
we went to the ballet
and the basketball...

16:04.696 --> 16:06.664
We just left the ballet
a little early.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.066
So how long did you stay?
Five minutes?

16:09.067 --> 16:12.469
Oh, come on.
We stayed 30 minutes.

16:16.074 --> 16:19.342
Tim, I have been trying
to expose the boys

16:19.343 --> 16:22.680
To something other than
sports, tools and cars.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.815
I mean, brad
has zero interest.

16:24.816 --> 16:27.417
Randy's light
is barely flickering.

16:27.418 --> 16:29.987
I had a chance with mark.
Why did you have to go
and ruin that?

16:29.988 --> 16:32.322
I didn't ruin it.
Now listen to me
for a minute.

16:32.323 --> 16:34.725
Courtside, players' bench.
These are very amazing seats.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.159
You don't get...
I don't care!

16:36.160 --> 16:38.729
You taught mark
something today!

16:38.730 --> 16:41.865
You taught him
that basketball is cool
and ballet is stupid.

16:41.866 --> 16:44.735
You're overreacting.
I did not tell him any of that.

16:44.736 --> 16:46.937
He does not think
ballet is stupid.

16:46.938 --> 16:48.973
We were only there
30 minutes.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.141
Now, had he been there
for the whole thing,
he might have...

16:51.142 --> 16:53.477
Oh, come on!

16:57.749 --> 17:00.183
<i>(♪ humming)</i>

17:00.184 --> 17:01.852
Wilson, what are you doing?

17:01.853 --> 17:04.054
Oh, just doing a little
spring cleaning, tim.

17:04.055 --> 17:05.454
Beating the dust
out of my rug.

17:05.455 --> 17:08.558
<i>(thump)</i>
I thought you had
your own hair.

17:08.559 --> 17:11.729
<i>(laughs)</i> oh, that's
a good one, neighbor.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.297
By the way, did you
find anybody

17:14.298 --> 17:16.299
To take those
basketball tickets
off your hands?

17:16.300 --> 17:19.502
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I took mark to the game.

17:19.503 --> 17:20.971
And I gotta to thank you
for the best seats

17:20.972 --> 17:22.906
I've ever had
at a basketball game.

17:22.906 --> 17:25.675
Really? I thought you were
going to the ballet.

17:25.676 --> 17:28.746
Uh, well...

17:28.747 --> 17:30.213
Tried to do both.

17:30.214 --> 17:31.982
Well, very good.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.718
Basketball and ballet
in the same day.

17:34.719 --> 17:37.688
You're raising your boys
to be renaissance men.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.791
Actually, I'm not interested
in renaissance men.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.960
I think ballet's stupid.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.561
Really?

17:44.562 --> 17:46.664
Well, why do you think
it's stupid?

17:46.665 --> 17:47.865
It's ballet.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.633
Uh-huh.

17:49.634 --> 17:52.002
What is it you don't
enjoy about it?

17:52.003 --> 17:54.038
It's ballet.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.740
Well, tim, I think
we've established that.

17:56.741 --> 17:59.476
How much ballet
have you actually seen?

17:59.477 --> 18:02.212
Well, counting the 30 minutes
I saw today,

18:02.213 --> 18:04.414
About 36 minutes,
lifetime total.

18:04.415 --> 18:06.416
Uh-huh. Well, then,
I would have to say

18:06.417 --> 18:09.853
That your opinion
is based on ignorance.

18:11.589 --> 18:13.356
You just called me ignorant?

18:13.357 --> 18:16.293
Well, when it comes
to ballet, I guess I did.

18:16.294 --> 18:18.662
Ignorance
is a breeding ground
for prejudice.

18:18.663 --> 18:22.032
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

18:22.033 --> 18:23.967
You ask anybody,
I'm not a prejudiced guy.

18:23.968 --> 18:27.204
Not against people.
Perhaps against ideas, though.

18:27.205 --> 18:30.974
See, tim, anytime a man
forms an opinion that's
not based on facts,

18:30.975 --> 18:32.976
Then he's a fool.

18:32.977 --> 18:34.845
Oh, great, great, great.

18:34.846 --> 18:38.048
Now I'm an ignorant,
prejudiced fool.

18:39.283 --> 18:40.784
Mm-hmm.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.292
I found this in mark's room.
Thanks.

18:49.293 --> 18:52.096
About yesterday,
I want to reiterate

18:52.097 --> 18:54.098
That getting courtside tickets
front row

18:54.099 --> 18:55.933
Is a very big deal.

18:55.934 --> 18:59.703
Tim, I'm happy
that you were there
to spend the day with mark.

18:59.704 --> 19:04.407
But every weekend, you know,
it's always these "guy" things.

19:04.408 --> 19:06.610
You know, there's basketball,
the hot rod, grunting,

19:06.611 --> 19:09.679
Making noises on the couch.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.751
It's, like, um...
This is a boys' club.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.485
You know, no girls allowed.

19:15.486 --> 19:19.123
Girls are allowed.
You just can't make
the same noises we can.

19:21.159 --> 19:25.462
You know, you don't
have to like the things
that I like.

19:25.463 --> 19:28.065
Whew. Thank you.

19:28.066 --> 19:31.701
I just want to make sure
that you make it ok
for the boys

19:31.702 --> 19:34.437
To like the things
that I like.

19:34.438 --> 19:36.306
Let them make up
their own minds, ok?

19:36.307 --> 19:37.707
Point well taken.
I understand it.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.676
You know, we did go
to the ballet, you know?

19:39.677 --> 19:42.679
And I did enjoy it.
You enjoyed it?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.714
Not the whole half hour,
but...

19:46.851 --> 19:48.551
I don't know what
the guy's name was.

19:48.552 --> 19:51.054
This one guy, twiddle toes,
he was like real athletic.

19:51.055 --> 19:52.355
This guy was jumping
up in the air.

19:52.356 --> 19:53.891
I mean, if he
had a basketball,

19:53.892 --> 19:57.060
He could have slam-dunked
that thing anywhere in the nba.

19:57.061 --> 19:59.096
I think you might
really enjoy ballet.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.298
Why don't you just
go with me sometime?

20:01.299 --> 20:03.500
Eh, stories are a little slow.
Men need more excitement.

20:03.501 --> 20:05.702
So I've... I had an idea.

20:05.703 --> 20:10.473
What?
I created a ballet
of my own.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.642
I don't think the dance world
is ready for this.

20:12.643 --> 20:16.713
Ah, I think you're wrong.
Come sit on the couch here.

20:16.714 --> 20:18.381
I made this tape

20:18.382 --> 20:22.252
For people who are prejudiced
against the ballet, ok?

20:22.253 --> 20:26.890
Ok, welcome to
the more power ballet hour.

20:26.891 --> 20:28.625
<i>(clears throat)</i>
<i>(laughing)</i> what?

20:28.626 --> 20:31.061
Tonight's feature

20:31.062 --> 20:34.597
Is prince ziegfried
in <i>eat my dust.</i>

20:34.598 --> 20:36.700
Oh, it's a happy day
in the village.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.702
The peasants
are awaiting the arrival

20:38.703 --> 20:40.403
Of the talented
prince ziegfried.

20:40.404 --> 20:42.940
There he is, the prince now.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.774
Oh, look. The prince
slam-dunks.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.409
Whoo! Nice.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.579
And the peasants rejoice.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.816
But just then, the evil baron
escapes his dungeon,

20:52.817 --> 20:54.451
And ziegfried's army
pursues him.

20:54.452 --> 20:56.686
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:56.687 --> 20:59.256
The baron is tackled
at about the 37-yard line.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.357
And the peasants...

21:00.358 --> 21:02.759
<i>(both)</i> ...Rejoice.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.963
But ziegfried, wanting
to escape his enemies,

21:05.964 --> 21:08.098
Mounts his trusted steed

21:08.099 --> 21:11.935
And pulls a 6-5 et
at 220 miles an hour.

21:11.936 --> 21:15.372
And the peasants rejoice.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.773
Look at those guys.

21:16.774 --> 21:20.410
Hence, the title of my piece,
<i>eat my dust</i> or...

21:20.411 --> 21:22.846
<i>(both) the peasants rejoice.</i>

21:30.054 --> 21:33.123
Look at this!
Look what I found.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.859
Looks like one of my cigars
out of my sock drawer.

21:35.860 --> 21:39.763
Yeah, it is.

21:39.764 --> 21:43.300
I also found it with this
little crumpled-up
bag of cookies.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.868
Your stash?

21:44.869 --> 21:46.569
My stash.

21:46.570 --> 21:50.573
Thus ends our
no-baby-sitter experience.

21:50.574 --> 21:52.842
I think we should get
those boys down here
so we can punish them.

21:52.843 --> 21:53.944
No, no, no, no, no.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.413
Wait a minute.
I got a better idea.

21:56.414 --> 21:58.982
What?
Just follow my lead.
Go get your coat.

21:58.983 --> 22:01.518
Boys, come down here!
Quick! Hurry up!

22:04.088 --> 22:05.889
<i>(sigh)</i> you gotta watch mark
for a little bit.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.457
We gotta take wilson
to the emergency room.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.327
Why?
What's the matter?

22:10.328 --> 22:13.430
I gave him one of those cigars
that I hide in my sock drawer.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.565
<i>(sighs)</i> he's real sick.

22:15.566 --> 22:17.901
Evidently the tobacco
was infected or something.

22:19.904 --> 22:21.704
Infected tobacco?

22:21.705 --> 22:24.574
Boy, is he feeling bad.
He's got this rash
al  up his leg, head to toe.

22:24.575 --> 22:25.943
He's itching like crazy.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.911
And he's got hair growing
out of his knuckles.

22:27.912 --> 22:30.981
Yeah, he does.
I saw it. It's gross.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.383
See you later.
Just watch mark,
all right?

22:41.359 --> 22:45.262
You know, I'm sorta
starting to itch.

22:45.263 --> 22:48.298
Yeah, me too.

22:48.299 --> 22:50.934
Maybe we better
go to the hospital
with mom and dad

22:50.935 --> 22:53.503
Before that hair
starts to grow.

22:53.504 --> 22:55.805
Busted!
Busted!

23:01.279 --> 23:03.180
<i>(stage manager)</i> 3, 2...

23:03.181 --> 23:06.083
And there, pasquini knife
has two different spoons.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.351
Never mind,
start over, please?

23:07.352 --> 23:08.818
There's no spoons on this.

23:08.819 --> 23:11.888
Pasquini knife
has two corkscrews,
four gun sites.

23:11.889 --> 23:13.756
Gun sites?

23:13.757 --> 23:17.760
Two corkscrews,
a toothpick, 32 blades.

23:17.761 --> 23:20.797
The pasquini knife here
can scare off an intruder

23:20.798 --> 23:23.100
While giving him a pedicure.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.701
Anyway, gadget corner is...
