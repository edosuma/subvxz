00:01.896 --> 00:04.263
Well, mom, that was
my apartment.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.163
And this here is the hallway.

00:06.230 --> 00:09.696
And now this Mother's Day
video card takes you down

00:09.763 --> 00:12.663
to the apartment
of my lady friend Synclaire.

00:12.730 --> 00:14.896
Why, I wonder if she's home.

00:15.596 --> 00:17.496
Hi there, Overton.

00:19.096 --> 00:21.930
Hi, Synclaire.
What a surprise to see you.

00:21.996 --> 00:25.230
‐ Won't you say hi to my mom?
‐ Hello, Mrs. Jones.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.230
Won't you come in?

00:27.296 --> 00:28.763
You know its almost
Mother's Day

00:28.830 --> 00:31.530
and the brownstone
is abuzz with holiday plans.

00:33.096 --> 00:35.930
Yes, here at the brownstone
we're all doing something

00:35.996 --> 00:39.630
to honor the woman
who carried us for nine months.

00:39.696 --> 00:41.630
Or in Kyle's case, seven.

00:45.063 --> 00:46.663
And look, there is Max.

00:46.730 --> 00:49.363
'Hiya, Max, what are you
gonna do for your mom?'

00:49.430 --> 00:52.130
Nothing. My mom and I
have an agreement.

00:52.196 --> 00:54.663
She doesn't expect anything
for Mother's Day

00:54.730 --> 00:56.730
and I let her
forget my birthday.

00:58.763 --> 01:01.970
You know, mom,
under Max's bitter exterior

01:02.036 --> 01:04.269
she's a real sweetheart.

01:04.336 --> 01:06.103
Yeah, bite me!

01:07.436 --> 01:09.303
Oh, my!

01:09.369 --> 01:12.670
Well, let's go and see what
Khadijah and Regine are doing

01:12.736 --> 01:14.270
for their moms.

01:14.336 --> 01:16.570
Come on, Regine,
hurry up and sign the card.

01:16.636 --> 01:18.870
‐ They'll be here any minute.
‐ Have you got everything?

01:18.936 --> 01:20.503
Yup, two plane tickets

01:20.570 --> 01:22.503
reservations at the
Radisson in the Bahamas

01:22.570 --> 01:25.603
and a round of free cocktails
at the Tipsy Turtle.

01:26.903 --> 01:28.703
Isn't that thoughtful?

01:28.770 --> 01:30.070
You know, mama.

01:30.136 --> 01:33.403
I know this tape isn't gonna be
as slick as your favorite show

01:33.470 --> 01:36.736

because I spent most of my dough

01:36.803 --> 01:41.003

um, check, check, check it out.

I'm delving into the rich
and varied past of my ancestors

02:24.910 --> 02:27.643
so that I can present my mom
with a beautiful leather‐bound

Khadijah, sending our moms
away to the Bahamas

Well, mom, in the past,
when I've given you presents

03:56.950 --> 03:58.883
I would preface it
with a speech

03:58.950 --> 04:00.890
about how it's the thought
that counts.

04:00.956 --> 04:03.190
Well, in this case,
the gift is so expensive

I just can't leave
your grandmother alone.

04:31.456 --> 04:33.889
She hasn't been
herself lately.

04:33.956 --> 04:36.956
But I just spoke to nana
last week. She sounded fine.

04:37.023 --> 04:39.256
She's been wandering off
for hours at a time

04:39.323 --> 04:41.690
and can't remember
where she's been.

I'm sorry, baby.
I just wouldn't feel right.

04:44.823 --> 04:47.656
Well, mom, that means
you get to enjoy

04:47.723 --> 04:51.590
an extra fog cutter
at the Tipsy Turtle, alright.

04:53.423 --> 04:57.190
Ah, I'm not going by myself.
I'd look desperate.

worried about nana

stay with us.

that my great‐great‐grandfather

a device that helped

06:12.203 --> 06:14.136
to usher in the modern age.

for generations.

06:38.436 --> 06:41.403
This woman is far too young
to be a grandmother.

Heh‐heh, you were right, Rita.
He sure can shovel it. Here.

06:46.936 --> 06:49.403
She is so excited
to be here.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.403
She's been talking
about it for days.

06:51.470 --> 06:54.036
And she's standing right here
and can talk for herself.

06:54.103 --> 06:55.336
Ooh, Regine.

06:55.403 --> 06:58.736
I've got to show you
this resort ensemble I found.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.576

07:04.876 --> 07:07.376
Yeah, and if you stand
on the beach at night

07:07.443 --> 07:09.676
you can help ships
find the shore.

Can you turn that away
from the camera?

flare‐up in through here.

if we're gonna make our plane.

Mom, are you
gonna be alright?

07:25.610 --> 07:28.876
Oh, Rita, this is not
my first time in a building.

07:28.943 --> 07:32.010

how the indoor plumbing works.

‐ Come on, Rita.

07:38.476 --> 07:40.376
‐ Alright, mom.
‐ Bye.

07:40.443 --> 07:43.443
Now would be a good time
to put the tape on pause

07:43.510 --> 07:45.876
so I can say hi to dad.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.710
Hi, dad.

‐ Now, drive me home.
‐ But you just got here.

told you to watch over me

08:02.083 --> 08:04.783

I don't wanna put y'all out.

to this all week.

Who's gonna make
the peanut butter pie?

08:11.283 --> 08:13.016
Yes, I don't wanna
hear another word

08:13.083 --> 08:14.893
about your famous
peanut butter pie

off the roof of my mouth.

to my baby girl?

08:35.426 --> 08:37.525
‐ Eight sticks of butter.
‐ Oh.

You just don't hear
words like that anymore.

if it wasn't for me. Ha ha ha.

if you don't know the words

Hey, hey, people.
Deal me in.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.633
Hey, Kyle, I thought
you were going to the library

09:04.700 --> 09:06.033
to research your family tree.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.566
Yeah, well, after giving it
careful consideration

09:08.633 --> 09:10.600
I decided to buy
my mother a statuette

09:10.666 --> 09:12.800
with the inscription,
"I Love You This Much."

09:13.600 --> 09:16.000
Aw. Woo, woo, woo.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.933
What happened?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.900
Well, it seems
my great‐great‐grandfather

09:21.966 --> 09:25.600
although a beverage visionary,
was also something of a dupe.

09:25.666 --> 09:29.200
Some fast‐talking charlatan
named Silas Taylor

09:29.266 --> 09:32.300
convinced him to sink his
entire fortune into a railroad

09:32.366 --> 09:35.933
that spanned the entire
Atlantic Ocean. Duh!

09:36.000 --> 09:37.366
'Anyway, two days later'

09:37.433 --> 09:40.366
Taylor was gone and so was
my great‐grandfather's money.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.566
Silas Taylor
from Macon, Georgia?

09:45.133 --> 09:46.200
Yeah.

09:46.266 --> 09:48.700
That's my
great‐great‐grandfather.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.200
Silas "Silver‐Tongue" Taylor.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.940
Maxine, don't play with me.

10:00.006 --> 10:01.640
No, for real!

10:01.706 --> 10:05.373
For years our family talked
about great‐great‐grandpa Silas

10:05.440 --> 10:07.973
and the moron who made him rich.

10:10.106 --> 10:12.440
Now, stupidity has a name.

10:19.973 --> 10:21.073
This is unbelievable.

Angel, zero.
Satan, one.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.040
Well, mom

10:29.106 --> 10:32.440
next time Kyle's mom
tries to act a bit sidity

10:32.506 --> 10:38.140
just say, "All aboard!
Next stop, Atlantis."

10:39.773 --> 10:42.706
Well, nothing like humiliating
Kyle to work up an appetite.

10:42.773 --> 10:43.806
Let's eat!

10:43.873 --> 10:44.840
[laughing]

10:44.906 --> 10:48.006
Oh, that sounds
like a fine idea.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.240
But, uh, although it is
grandma's nap time

10:50.306 --> 10:52.506
um, y'all go on without me.

10:52.573 --> 10:55.573
Oh, no, nana. I don't know about
leaving you here by yourself.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.940
Well, honey, nana's
been nappin' by herself

10:58.006 --> 11:01.180
for plenty years now.
I think I've got it down.

11:01.246 --> 11:02.580
But, nana, I'm not‐‐

11:02.646 --> 11:05.913
I know your mother's got you
thinkin' that I'm helpless.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.713
I am just fine.

11:08.413 --> 11:09.713
Okay.

11:09.780 --> 11:13.013
Well, is there anything
I can bring you back?

11:13.080 --> 11:14.346
A great‐grandbaby.

11:16.846 --> 11:18.480
How about a turkey burger?

11:19.746 --> 11:21.980
You have a good nap.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.880
Nana, we're back.

11:30.213 --> 11:32.046
Nana, where are you?

11:32.113 --> 11:34.846
She's probably upstairs. Nana!

11:34.913 --> 11:37.613
‐ Nana?
‐ Is she up there?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.146
(Synclaire)
'I don't see her.'

11:39.213 --> 11:41.213
Oh, my God!
She's wandered off.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.313
[phone rings]

11:43.513 --> 11:44.480
Hello.

11:44.546 --> 11:46.346
Hi, ma.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.913
I'm glad you made it
there safely.

11:48.980 --> 11:50.880
All fine.

11:50.946 --> 11:53.180
‐ Nana?
‐ No nana there.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.080
Nana's gone,
she's disappeared.

11:55.146 --> 11:58.346
No, no, ma. She said,
"Nana's dish is here."

11:58.413 --> 12:00.086
We ordered out.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.353
Yeah. Huh? Wha, huh?

12:03.420 --> 12:06.353
I can't hear you.
We must have a bad connection.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.353
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.353
[crying]
I lost my nana.

12:18.152 --> 12:20.852
I can't believe
I lost my nana.

12:20.918 --> 12:24.585
Oh, God. I should never
have left her alone.

12:24.652 --> 12:27.652
Mama, I'd just like to take
this time out to assure you

12:27.718 --> 12:30.685
that the misplacing
of elderly people

12:30.752 --> 12:33.818
is not an everyday
occurrence here..

12:33.885 --> 12:35.885
...at the brownstone.

12:37.752 --> 12:39.852
Your nana took my wig!

12:41.952 --> 12:45.218
My Cleopatra wig. That's
real hair from the Philippines.

12:45.285 --> 12:47.552
You better find her!

12:49.085 --> 12:51.018
I can't believe
she would just disappear

12:51.085 --> 12:52.818
without at least
leaving a note.

12:52.885 --> 12:54.852
You mean, besides this one?

12:54.918 --> 12:56.985
"To Khadijah, from nana?"

12:59.485 --> 13:02.758
"Dear Khadijah, I didn't wanna
be in the way so I went home.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.725
"Thanks for everything.

13:04.792 --> 13:07.392
P.S. does that Max girl
live here or not?"

13:09.625 --> 13:11.558
Thank God, she's alright.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.658
I'm gonna kill her.

13:15.958 --> 13:17.892
Forget this.
I'm going to Jersey.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.158
I'm goin' with you.

13:20.225 --> 13:21.558
Come on, Synclaire.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.258
Mama love this,
an action sequence.

13:35.558 --> 13:36.525
[knock on door]

13:36.592 --> 13:38.058
(Khadijah)
'Nana!'

13:38.792 --> 13:41.192
Nana, are you here?

13:41.258 --> 13:43.958
I think somebody's here. I smell
Bengay and collard greens.

13:47.358 --> 13:50.358
‐ Thank God, you're alright!
‐ Of course, I'm alright.

13:50.425 --> 13:53.392
I had a homemade meal
and a deep‐heating rub.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.425
Well, as you can see, mom,
we've located nana.

13:56.492 --> 13:58.625
And she's fine and looking
particularly fetchin'

13:58.692 --> 14:00.832
in that nice wig.

14:02.065 --> 14:03.798
Which is mine.

14:05.432 --> 14:08.665
Hm. You always were
a stingy little somebody.

14:11.498 --> 14:14.498
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ I left you a note.

14:14.565 --> 14:16.665
I came to be
with my things.

14:22.798 --> 14:24.798
She came home to be with me.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.198
Mr. Hampton, the baker?

14:31.398 --> 14:33.932
I've never seen
this man before in my life.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.732
Oh, my goodness, Ruth.
Let's cut the charade.

14:36.798 --> 14:40.098
Now, we love each other,
and I don't care who knows it.

14:40.165 --> 14:42.665
Work it, nana.

14:45.098 --> 14:48.065
So this is why
you've been wanderin' off.

14:48.132 --> 14:51.932
And if you so much as breathe
one word of this to your mother

14:51.998 --> 14:54.998
you have seen your last
peanut butter pie.

14:55.065 --> 14:57.132
‐ That goes for you too, missy.
‐'What!'

14:57.198 --> 14:59.938
I don't want that town crier
of a mother of yours

15:00.005 --> 15:01.938
getting a hold of this.

15:02.005 --> 15:03.438
Please. If you're
not pregnant

15:03.505 --> 15:05.438
this isn't big enough
for my mother.

15:06.938 --> 15:08.772
Why the big secret?

15:08.838 --> 15:10.438
Do you tell your mother

15:10.505 --> 15:13.205
about every man
you've been intimate with?

15:13.272 --> 15:14.638
Grandmother!

15:16.872 --> 15:20.405
Why, I'm saving myself
for the man I'm going to marry.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.305
‐ So am I.
‐ Ha ha ha.

15:26.605 --> 15:28.338
Why don't you just
tell Aunt Rita

15:28.405 --> 15:29.738
that you have a boyfriend?

15:29.805 --> 15:32.138
It worked out well
for me and my roommates

15:32.205 --> 15:34.938
when I told 'em that
Obie and I were having s..

15:40.205 --> 15:42.572
You know, this is really
Khadijah's business. I'm..

15:45.672 --> 15:49.205
Look, I promised my mother
that I'd take care of you.

15:49.272 --> 15:51.238
If you want me
to keep your secret

15:51.305 --> 15:53.305
you've to come back
to Brooklyn with me.

15:53.372 --> 15:55.105
I'm staying here
with Milton.

15:55.172 --> 15:57.705
‐ Fine. I'm telling mom.
‐ Fine. I'll deny it.

15:57.772 --> 15:58.872
And she will.

15:58.938 --> 16:00.478
Now, from what I've seen

16:00.545 --> 16:02.778
she's a much
better liar than you.

16:04.645 --> 16:07.078
Okay...nana.

16:07.145 --> 16:09.078
But I got it all on tape.

16:13.445 --> 16:16.178
Come on, Milton, drain the
bubble bath and help me pack.

16:16.245 --> 16:17.645
Okay.

16:17.712 --> 16:20.678
Blackmailing me after all the
whippings I've saved her from.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.778
They think we don't know how
to make love 'cause we old.

16:27.345 --> 16:28.612
Now, you're cold,
Khadijah.

16:28.678 --> 16:30.778
Breaking up their
romantic weekend.

16:31.245 --> 16:32.378
[scoffs]

16:32.445 --> 16:34.745
Yeah, I could never
do that to my granny.

16:34.812 --> 16:37.645
Your granny died
15 years ago.

16:37.712 --> 16:39.645
She did not!

16:39.712 --> 16:42.012
Mom and dad told me
she bought a farm.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.478
Synclaire..

16:47.945 --> 16:49.945
She bought the farm.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.012
Oh, my God!

16:55.212 --> 16:57.245
[sobbing]
Granny's dead.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.052
[knock on door]

17:02.118 --> 17:04.152
Ah, Max, you are here.

17:04.218 --> 17:06.318
What are the odds of that?

17:07.917 --> 17:10.385
Well, further research
into my lineage has revealed

17:10.452 --> 17:11.885
this little tidbit.

17:11.952 --> 17:14.117
It seems my
great‐great‐grandfather

17:14.185 --> 17:17.452
was not your ancestors'
only victim. Oh, no.

17:17.518 --> 17:20.117
He also swindled
a woman named Sarah.

17:20.185 --> 17:23.318
Sarah and Elijah were so
devastated that they took solace

17:23.385 --> 17:24.685
in each others arms.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.318
And they planted the seed,
that planted the seed

17:27.385 --> 17:29.785
that planted the seed,
that made me.

17:31.885 --> 17:35.952
So, you see, if it were not
for your thieving relatives

17:36.018 --> 17:39.885
the unique genetic cocktail
that is moi, would not exist.

17:39.952 --> 17:41.185
[laughing]

17:42.785 --> 17:43.752
Thanks.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.918
Well, I guess, there's only
one thing to do now.

17:50.985 --> 17:53.785
Send a cyborg into the past
to kill that man.

17:55.952 --> 17:57.585
I miss you too, Milton.

17:57.652 --> 17:58.618
[doorbell rings]

17:58.685 --> 18:00.085
Oh, I think that's them.

18:00.152 --> 18:03.692
Uh, I'll see you tonight.
At our usual place.

18:03.758 --> 18:06.258
Maybe I can get that
wig again. Ha ha ha.

18:07.692 --> 18:08.758
Okay, bye.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.525
‐ Hey...ha ha!
‐ Oh, hi.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.058
Look at you
all tanned up..

18:15.125 --> 18:17.658
You need to send us
to the Bahamas more often.

18:17.725 --> 18:18.858
I know, that's right.

18:18.925 --> 18:21.425
It was like a tropical
version of the Jersey shore

18:21.492 --> 18:22.825
only no syringes.

18:24.158 --> 18:27.425
And I got a little
something for you.

18:34.825 --> 18:36.092
I love it!

18:37.725 --> 18:39.458
It goes with anything.

18:40.325 --> 18:41.925
Oh, it's gonna go, alright.

18:43.358 --> 18:46.358
What do you say, we let these
ladies have their re‐union, huh?

18:46.425 --> 18:49.592
Yeah. Good point, shorty.

18:49.658 --> 18:53.492
That doesn't mean
you have to miss anything, mom.

18:53.558 --> 18:54.858
Excuse us, ladies.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.858
And, uh,
when at all possible

18:56.925 --> 18:59.925
uh, just try
to look this way.

18:59.992 --> 19:02.998
‐ These are for you.
‐ Okay. Thank you.

19:03.065 --> 19:07.265
‐ Ooh! It's beautiful. Thanks.
‐ Oh, nice.

19:07.332 --> 19:09.098
So how were things here?

19:10.332 --> 19:12.398
Uh, great!

19:12.465 --> 19:14.398
I think I'll go
try this on.

19:14.465 --> 19:16.865
Khadijah,
what happened?

19:16.932 --> 19:19.298
Nothin'. This is wonderful.

19:19.365 --> 19:22.132
It's so versatile,
you can use it as a sarong or..

19:22.198 --> 19:23.265
...a head wrap.

19:23.332 --> 19:25.265
Mmm.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.765
Khadijah, you're lying.
Synclaire, what happened?

19:28.832 --> 19:31.232
Why are you asking
an innocent bystander?

19:31.298 --> 19:33.432
Stay on Khadijah.
She'll crack.

19:35.732 --> 19:37.065
Khadijah..

19:40.465 --> 19:41.465
[clears throat]

19:43.798 --> 19:46.465
Nana went away
to be with her boyfriend.

19:47.932 --> 19:49.365
Boyfriend?

19:49.432 --> 19:52.498
Here I am thinking that
you've been losing your mind

19:52.565 --> 19:54.332
and the truth is that
you've been

19:54.398 --> 19:56.432
running around with some man?

19:56.498 --> 19:59.638
‐ He has a name. Milton.
‐ Milton, the baker?

19:59.705 --> 20:02.172
Yeah, Milton, the baker.

20:04.338 --> 20:06.838
She didn't think you could
handle her being with anyone

20:06.905 --> 20:08.872
other than papa.

20:08.938 --> 20:13.072
I didn't feel comfortable
talking to you about my men.

20:13.138 --> 20:16.338
‐ Men? Did she say men?
‐ That's what I heard. Men?

20:18.305 --> 20:21.872
‐ Ma, how many have there been?
‐ Told you she can't handle it.

20:21.938 --> 20:24.438
‐ You haven't given a chance.
‐ You always take her side.

20:24.505 --> 20:27.005
‐ Well, she's my mom.
‐ But she never takes my side.

20:27.072 --> 20:30.372
How can I take your side?
You never tell me anything.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.705
Well, in my day

20:31.772 --> 20:34.705
mothers and daughters
didn't talk about these things.

20:34.772 --> 20:37.738
We'd just snuck around and
everything turned out alright.

20:40.272 --> 20:43.638
Ma, things did not
work out alright.

20:43.705 --> 20:46.972
I wanted to know more about
what was going on in your life.

20:47.038 --> 20:50.805
That's why I try to keep an open
relationship with my daughter.

20:50.872 --> 20:54.538
Khadijah and I tell
each other everything.

20:54.605 --> 20:57.838
Uh, yeah. So you gonna
tell her about Nigel.

20:59.945 --> 21:01.312
Who's Nigel?

21:01.378 --> 21:04.012
Nigel's the snorkeling
instructor. Look here.

21:06.812 --> 21:09.812
Oh, that will teach you
to leave me alone on a beach.

21:12.978 --> 21:14.378
A snorkeler, huh?

21:15.712 --> 21:16.945
Yes, mother.

21:17.912 --> 21:20.045
Well, you know..

21:20.112 --> 21:22.112
Snorkelers are pretty good
with the pucker

21:22.178 --> 21:24.545
but bakers are great
with their hands.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.245
(both)
Ah, suki suki now.

21:33.112 --> 21:36.845
Oh, mom, now that we're being
more open with one another

21:36.912 --> 21:39.645
I've gotta ask you...

21:39.712 --> 21:42.718
Are you practicing
safe sex?

21:42.785 --> 21:45.185
Okay! Over to
"Knights of God."

21:52.283 --> 21:53.983
Well, mom, here it is.

21:54.049 --> 21:56.049
The Mothers Day video card.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.083
Um, sorry, it's a tad late

21:58.149 --> 22:01.623
but as you saw, interesting
stories started to unfold

22:01.689 --> 22:04.523
and I felt I had
a responsibility to you

22:04.589 --> 22:08.789
the home‐viewing audience,
to see it through to the end.

22:08.856 --> 22:11.589
Oh, and by the way,
here's some stuff that we saw

22:11.656 --> 22:13.123
on the way to nana's house

22:13.189 --> 22:15.923
that we didn't have time
to stop and fully investigate.

22:15.989 --> 22:17.556
[whirring]

22:23.823 --> 22:25.189
Woo‐hoo!
