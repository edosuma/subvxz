run through some do's and do nots.</font>

00:25.194 --> 00:28.193

down, get used to the feel of it.</font>

You can't just appear like that,
not when we're in bed.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Were you and Mike making a baby?</font>
Er, what? No! No.

04:55.259 --> 04:57.258
I mean, I was hoping we'd get in
a bit of practice, but...

04:57.259 --> 05:00.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Practice?</font>
You know, getting jiggy with it.

He's dead, I think.</font>

05:10.260 --> 05:13.258

one of the others. I've got to go.

Hi, Terry. You all right, mate?

05:26.927 --> 05:29.392
<font color="#11FF11"> Ah! There you are. Jolly good.
Now, look here.</font>

05:29.393 --> 05:31.258
<font color="#11FF11"> I mean, I thought the Blitz was bad,</font>

05:31.259 --> 05:33.526
<font color="#11FF11"> but your builders make the Luftwaffe
look like a youth group.</font>

05:33.527 --> 05:36.258
<font color="#11FF11"> No offence, Pat. We know your lot
were capable of killing.</font>

05:36.259 --> 05:37.259
Please, not now!

05:37.260 --> 05:39.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh. Sorry. I'll...</font>
No, not you, Terry.

05:39.393 --> 05:42.659
I was just talking to... Mike.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.258
SHOUTS: Not now, Mike!

05:44.259 --> 05:46.258
<font color="#11FF11"> MIKE: </font>What?</font>

05:46.259 --> 05:47.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right.</font>

05:47.260 --> 05:49.258
Yes, Terry. How are you?
How's it going?

05:49.259 --> 05:51.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, good, good.
We've finally managed</font>

05:51.259 --> 05:53.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> to make the roof watertight
in the, erm...</font>

05:53.259 --> 05:54.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..the back bit.</font>

05:54.260 --> 05:55.526

05:55.527 --> 05:58.258
East wing. Thank you... Terry.

05:58.259 --> 05:59.793
<font color="#FFFF00"> But we have found something else.</font>

05:59.794 --> 06:02.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> The drainage from
the east wing is cracked.</font>

06:02.259 --> 06:04.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know when it was put in.</font>

06:04.194 --> 06:05.258
<font color="#11FF11"> 1894.</font>

06:05.259 --> 06:08.258
1894. Erm, probably, between...

06:08.259 --> 06:09.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Not now, what?</font>

06:10.393 --> 06:13.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Not now! Huh! </font>Hmm?</font>

06:13.259 --> 06:15.060
What's he like, Terry?

06:15.061 --> 06:18.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right. Well, it needs a lot of work
to make sure it doesn't breach.</font>

06:18.259 --> 06:20.659
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can do you a quote
on top of the old one,</font>

06:20.660 --> 06:22.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> which has gone up a bit, I'm afraid.</font>

06:22.259 --> 06:25.060
<font color="#00FFFF"> We don't have any more money.</font>
Great, great!

06:25.061 --> 06:26.526
We'll probably just put
our heads together

06:26.527 --> 06:28.258
and run some numbers up the flagpole

06:28.259 --> 06:30.659
and just see if any of that
makes any sense.

06:32.259 --> 06:35.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Excuse me. Excuse me.</font>
Yeah, by all means.

06:35.259 --> 06:38.258
<font color="#11FF11"> What are you doing? We can't just
agree to more work like that.</font>

06:38.259 --> 06:41.193
<font color="#11FF11"> We're burning through money
quicker than actually burning money.</font>

06:41.194 --> 06:43.258
Mike, it's fine. This is all part of
being project manager.

06:43.259 --> 06:44.259
It's a negotiation.

06:44.260 --> 06:47.258
You get them on side,
do a bit of wheeling, dealing.

06:47.259 --> 06:49.258
You gotta be mates,
if you want mate's rates.

06:49.259 --> 06:51.258
He's coming, he's coming, he's
coming.

06:51.259 --> 06:54.193
Listen, Tel,
let's chat numbers later,

06:54.194 --> 06:57.258
and in the meantime, how about
a nice cup of old Rosie Lee?

06:57.259 --> 06:59.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, yeah. No milk, four sugars.</font>

06:59.259 --> 07:00.259
OK... Watch out!

07:04.259 --> 07:07.259
For the sugar, Terry!
Come on, that's too many.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Isn't it, Mike? </font>Yeah.</font>

07:13.259 --> 07:15.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Just checking -
that was a ghost thing, right? </font>Yep.

07:15.259 --> 07:17.258

which is why you went weird?</font>

<font color="#FFFF00"> ..like a...</font>

07:47.260 --> 07:50.258

such short notice and that,</font>

07:50.259 --> 07:54.258
<font color="#11FF11"> but we've just got so much rubbish
to clear up.</font>

I mean, loads of it. Seriously.</font>

07:56.259 --> 07:58.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Builders are awful, aren't they?</font>

07:58.259 --> 08:02.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> I had a terrible time when I was
extending the Bramptons back in '86.</font>

08:02.260 --> 08:04.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's a modest Oxfordshire pile.</font>

08:04.259 --> 08:06.258

wet room,</font>

08:06.259 --> 08:08.258
<font color="#11FF11">blah-blah-blah-blah.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Sounds frightfully expensive.</font>

08:08.259 --> 08:12.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, no, I didn't pay for it, no.
I ran it through MPs' expenses.</font>

08:12.260 --> 08:14.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> The great British taxpayer
covered it.</font>

08:14.259 --> 08:16.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wonderful idiots! Now, where was I?</font>

08:16.259 --> 08:19.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yes, builders. Well, I mean,
they're all thieves, aren't they?</font>

08:19.259 --> 08:21.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Tinkers to a man.</font>

08:21.259 --> 08:24.258

the potty banter.</font>

08:24.259 --> 08:26.926
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ooh! Wait a minute, that's it!</font>

08:26.927 --> 08:28.258
<font color="#11FF11"> What's what?</font>

08:28.259 --> 08:31.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> All we have to do is watch
these builders closely</font>

08:31.527 --> 08:35.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> until they commit some sort of
misdemeanour, report it to Alison...</font>

08:35.259 --> 08:37.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> And she'll send them away with
a flea in their ear.</font>

08:37.259 --> 08:38.659
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Yes! </font>Let's get organised.</font>

08:40.259 --> 08:41.926
I have flea in ear.

08:41.927 --> 08:43.259
<font color="#11FF11"> But you're dead.</font>

08:43.260 --> 08:44.660
So is flea.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.259
I also have worms.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.660
<font color="#11FF11"> Ugh.</font>

08:54.259 --> 08:56.061
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ah! There's two in here.</font>

08:58.259 --> 08:59.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> A proper pair of oiks.</font>

08:59.527 --> 09:01.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> This'll be like shooting fish
in a barrel,</font>

09:01.527 --> 09:03.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> which I did for real once.</font>

09:03.259 --> 09:05.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Party Conference, Bournemouth.
Great fun.</font>

09:05.259 --> 09:07.258
<font color="#11FF11"> I might sneak off a bit earlier
today, Wixy.</font>

09:07.259 --> 09:10.258
<font color="#11FF11"> This is going to be easy. </font>Shouldn't
be a problem. Where are you off to?

09:10.259 --> 09:12.392
<font color="#11FF11"> I need to get back
to that community project thing.</font>

09:12.393 --> 09:14.258
Oh, yeah, the kids' playground
at the hospital.

09:14.259 --> 09:16.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I mean, there's being nice,
that's one thing,</font>

09:16.259 --> 09:18.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> but that's just weird nice.</font>

09:18.259 --> 09:21.393
<font color="#FFFF00"> All right. There's plenty more where
they came from. Come along.</font>

09:29.393 --> 09:32.258
Ohh! Pat!

09:32.259 --> 09:33.259
SHE SIGHS

09:34.393 --> 09:36.258
You all right?

09:36.259 --> 09:38.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Tomorrow's my death day.</font>

09:38.259 --> 09:42.659
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh! Happy... death day. </font>Hmm.</font>

09:42.660 --> 09:46.926
I'm really sorry, Pat.
I've actually never asked you,

09:46.927 --> 09:49.259
how did you die, exactly?

09:50.259 --> 09:52.258
Sorry, no. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

09:52.259 --> 09:56.193
I just wanted to lighten the mood,
and it hasn't worked. Sorry.

09:56.194 --> 09:57.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> That must be really hard for you.</font>
Yeah, it is, yeah.</font>

09:57.527 --> 10:00.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> But on the plus side,
I get to see my family, so...</font>

10:00.259 --> 10:01.259
Oh! What? What?

10:01.260 --> 10:04.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah. Every year,
they come to pay their respects.</font>

10:04.259 --> 10:06.260
<font color="#FFFF00"> They'll be here tomorrow,
over there.</font>

10:07.794 --> 10:09.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh... </font>Yeah, it used to be a tree,</font>

10:09.259 --> 10:11.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> but it blew down in
the great storm of 1987.</font>

10:11.527 --> 10:15.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I mean, people say it was a storm,
but it was a hurricane, Alison.</font>

10:15.259 --> 10:17.526
Well, that'll be nice,
to see your family.

10:17.527 --> 10:21.527
<font color="#FFFF00"> And I thought, wouldn't it be great
to pass on a message to them?</font>

10:23.259 --> 10:26.259
Oh, no, Pat. I don't think
that's such a great idea.

10:26.260 --> 10:29.659
Oh, it is. <span tts: color="white <font color="#FFFF00"> Mm... </font>I could let Carol
know that I was OK.</font>

10:29.660 --> 10:33.060
<font color="#FFFF00"> The whole family come! Daley,
he's my son, and his girlfriend,</font>

10:33.061 --> 10:35.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> they'll be there,
and... and Carol's husband Morris.</font>

10:35.527 --> 10:37.193
She remarried?

10:37.194 --> 10:39.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's fine.</font>

10:39.259 --> 10:40.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm very happy for them.</font>

10:40.260 --> 10:42.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Morris was actually my best mate,</font>

10:42.259 --> 10:44.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> so it was really lovely when
he married Carol.</font>

10:44.259 --> 10:46.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> He was always such a support to her,</font>

10:46.259 --> 10:47.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> even before I died.</font>

10:47.393 --> 10:49.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hmm. </font>He was always round.</font>

10:49.259 --> 10:51.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> He had his own set of keys.</font>

10:51.194 --> 10:53.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I remember, one Sunday,
I came back from camp</font>

10:53.259 --> 10:56.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I found all his clothes
in the hallway.</font>

10:56.259 --> 10:59.260
<font color="#FFFF00"> Everything, his socks, his knickers,
they were all strewn up the stairs.</font>

11:04.259 --> 11:06.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, no. </font>Mm.

11:06.259 --> 11:08.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

11:08.259 --> 11:09.393
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, no. </font>Oh, no.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Carol!</font>

11:18.259 --> 11:20.794
<font color="#11FF11"> Anyone dead in here?</font>

11:39.259 --> 11:40.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Ow!</font>

11:47.527 --> 11:49.794
SHE TUTS, WATER RUNS

11:51.259 --> 11:55.193
<font color="#00FFFF"> Don't worry, it's only a matter of
time. Builders are born to hustle.</font>

11:55.194 --> 11:57.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's in their DNA. Oh, hang on
a minute. Ah, there we are!</font>

11:57.527 --> 12:00.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> That's perfect. </font>Here he comes!</font>

12:00.259 --> 12:02.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Our work here is done.</font>
BOTH CHUCKLE

12:02.259 --> 12:04.258
<font color="#00FFFF">Oi, Mike! </font>Yeah? <font color="#FFFF00"> What?</font>

12:04.259 --> 12:06.926
<font color="#00FFFF">You dropped your wallet, mate.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> You've got to be joking.</font>

12:06.927 --> 12:09.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Damnation! Tough nuts
to crack, this lot.</font>

12:09.259 --> 12:11.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Reminds me of Monty
in the desert in '42.</font>

12:11.259 --> 12:12.926
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, yeah? </font>Totally hemmed in.</font>

12:12.927 --> 12:14.258
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Interesting. </font>But he persisted.</font>

12:14.259 --> 12:15.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, this is happening now.</font>

12:21.259 --> 12:23.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> Where are you off to?</font>
I'm going to the pub.</font>

12:23.927 --> 12:25.258
Mike, it's barely midday.

12:25.259 --> 12:29.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, well, sometimes, you know,
a guy just wants to...</font>

12:29.259 --> 12:31.060
You're doing a Glastonbury,
aren't you?

12:31.061 --> 12:33.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK. So, I admit I have some issues.</font>

12:33.259 --> 12:35.258
Mike, you left the festival
to go for a poo.

12:35.259 --> 12:37.258
Not just the campsite,
the entire festival.

12:37.259 --> 12:41.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> So I need poo space. It's hard
enough when people are close by,</font>

12:41.194 --> 12:43.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> let alone when there might be ghosts
in there with me.</font>

12:43.393 --> 12:45.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> You've got this covered,
though, yeah?</font>

12:45.259 --> 12:46.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> Project manager? </font>Yeah!

12:46.393 --> 12:48.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Get us that deal! </font>Sure.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.258
They're not watching you!

12:50.259 --> 12:51.659
<font color="#00FFFF"> I am! </font>Oh, my God!

12:51.660 --> 12:52.927
Stop sneaking up on me!

12:54.259 --> 12:55.259
SHE GASPS

12:55.260 --> 12:56.660
GIGGLING

12:58.393 --> 13:01.926
Hello, Terry. Can I get you a tea?

13:01.927 --> 13:03.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, you're all right.</font>

13:04.260 --> 13:06.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, Alison...</font>

13:07.259 --> 13:09.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> My Alison...</font>

13:09.259 --> 13:10.660
<font color="#FFFF00"> You are like...</font>

13:14.259 --> 13:15.259

13:20.259 --> 13:22.259
Algorithm? <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#11FF11"> Or hessian?</font>
Or marathon.</font>

13:22.260 --> 13:24.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Please, will you hush?</font>

13:24.259 --> 13:25.659
<font color="#FFFF00"> I cannot hear myself think!</font>

13:25.660 --> 13:27.258
MURMURING

13:27.259 --> 13:29.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> You know nothing of poetry!</font>

13:29.259 --> 13:30.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Off he goes.</font>

13:31.794 --> 13:33.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Talisman?</font>

13:33.259 --> 13:34.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, that's brilliant. </font>I said that.</font>

13:34.260 --> 13:36.659
<font color="#00FFFF">No, you didn't.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> I said that five minutes ago.</font>

13:36.660 --> 13:39.258
<font color="#00FFFF">No, you didn't.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> I didn't hear you say that.</font>

13:39.259 --> 13:41.793
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I did.</font>
I thought of it myself, anyway.</font>

13:41.794 --> 13:45.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> LADY BUTTON: </font>You want to know how
babies are made, Kitty?</font>

13:45.259 --> 13:50.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, the bees, you see, like men,
visit the flowers.</font>

13:50.260 --> 13:53.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Some bees like just one
type of flower,</font>

13:53.260 --> 13:55.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> though it turns out not your flower,</font>

13:55.259 --> 13:57.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> cos your flower just
isn't good enough,</font>

13:57.259 --> 13:58.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> so there you are, on display,</font>

13:58.393 --> 14:02.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> waiting for the big, strong bee with
his big pollen sacs underneath him,</font>

14:02.259 --> 14:04.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and he goes to a different flower,</font>

14:04.259 --> 14:07.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> and sometimes, Kitty,
the bee only likes other bees,</font>

14:07.927 --> 14:11.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> and you think, well, why have you
chosen that bee and not my flower?</font>

14:11.194 --> 14:12.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> But they don't care, you see?</font>

14:12.259 --> 14:14.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> They just buzz around
and ignore you!</font>

14:18.259 --> 14:20.060
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's fascinating...</font>

14:20.061 --> 14:21.259
LAUGHTER

14:22.260 --> 14:24.060

14:31.259 --> 14:34.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ah, now, Fanny, I insist,
you really do not want to see.</font>

14:34.259 --> 14:36.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> This really isn't something you
should be looking at...</font>

14:36.259 --> 14:39.258
<font color="#11FF11"> How on earth are they
both doing that?</font>

14:39.259 --> 14:42.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Absolutely... </font>Do you know what,
Fanny? I-I-I think you should go</font>

14:42.527 --> 14:45.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and report this
to Alison straight away.</font>

14:45.259 --> 14:47.258

14:47.259 --> 14:50.193

Yeah, well, that's a tricky one.</font>

14:59.259 --> 15:02.193
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> I have never been so outraged...</font>
There's no way two ways about it.</font>

15:02.194 --> 15:04.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> ..in all my life! </font>The big issue is
finding where to dig.</font>

some grotesquery</font>

15:06.259 --> 15:07.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> on their magic lanterns. </font>For that,</font>

15:07.260 --> 15:09.259
we need to get the old ground
radar in... <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> It's disgusting!</font>

15:09.260 --> 15:12.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Two monkeys doing unspeakable
things! </font>And it wasn't budgeted for.</font>

15:12.259 --> 15:13.392
Oh, the video!

15:13.393 --> 15:15.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it's more like an ultrasound,</font>

15:15.259 --> 15:17.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> but it does have
a screen on it, yeah.</font>

15:17.259 --> 15:21.258
Sorry, Terry, I was actually just
thinking about that, um,

15:21.259 --> 15:23.258
<font color="#11FF11"> that YouTube video, in the safari
park... </font>That's the one.</font>

15:23.259 --> 15:25.258

15:25.259 --> 15:26.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Have you seen it?</font>
Yeah, yeah, I have, yeah.</font>

15:26.260 --> 15:29.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's pretty funny, yeah.</font>
It is funny, actually.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.526
<font color="#11FF11"> A real Button wouldn't stand
for this sort of behaviour!</font>

15:31.527 --> 15:33.793
Well, could you not watch it,
please, Terry,

15:33.794 --> 15:36.258
because, um, it's not acceptable
behaviour.

15:36.259 --> 15:38.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not in this house.</font>
Not in this house.

15:39.259 --> 15:40.527
<font color="#00FFFF"> Filthy. Dirty. </font>Filth...

15:43.259 --> 15:45.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, well, why don't we have
this chat tomorrow, yeah?</font>

15:45.393 --> 15:48.259
Oh, sorry, Terry, I... Yeah.

15:49.259 --> 15:51.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's OK, Alison,
I've changed my mind.</font>

15:51.259 --> 15:53.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't want you to talk to my
wife. </font>Right. Good.

15:53.927 --> 15:56.258
I want you to kill her. <span tts: color="white <font color="#FFFF00"> You what?!</font>
Well, don't you see?</font>

15:56.259 --> 15:58.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> With any luck, she'll become
a ghost, like me.</font>

15:58.259 --> 16:00.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> And we can be together
for ever and ever.</font>

16:00.259 --> 16:01.259
Great, great, yeah.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.258
So, shall I push her in the lake
or, ooh, take her up to the roof

16:04.259 --> 16:05.926
and just throw her off?

16:05.927 --> 16:07.793
<font color="#FFFF00"> Either's fine,
just don't mark her face.</font>

16:07.794 --> 16:10.258
Of course I'm not going
to kill your wife, Pat!

16:10.259 --> 16:12.258
It's a terrible idea!

16:12.259 --> 16:13.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm so sorry.</font>

16:14.259 --> 16:16.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> What have I become?</font>

16:16.259 --> 16:18.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm a monster!</font>

This is my sighing place.</font>

16:46.259 --> 16:48.258
<font color="#11FF11"> No, fine! I wasn't trying to work,
or anything.</font>

16:48.259 --> 16:50.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Let's make an evening of it.</font>

16:50.259 --> 16:52.060
<font color="#11FF11"> Bring wine!</font>

16:52.061 --> 16:53.258
<font color="#11FF11"> And figs!</font>

16:53.259 --> 16:57.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I actually don't know
if I want them to come any more.</font>

16:57.259 --> 17:00.258
<font color="#11FF11"> I hate to be the one to tell you
this, Patrick,</font>

17:00.259 --> 17:01.259
<font color="#11FF11"> but eventually no-one will come.</font>

17:01.260 --> 17:03.259
<font color="#11FF11"> That's just the way of it.</font>

17:04.259 --> 17:08.392
<font color="#00FFFF"> What Thomas try to say is...</font>

17:08.393 --> 17:09.527
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..you die...</font>

17:12.060 --> 17:14.527
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..time pass, everything change.</font>

17:16.259 --> 17:19.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Family not come any more.</font>

17:20.259 --> 17:22.193
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is pain,</font>

17:22.194 --> 17:24.792
<font color="#00FFFF"> but you heal.</font>

17:24.794 --> 17:26.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah.</font>

17:26.527 --> 17:29.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> You remember them here.</font>

17:31.259 --> 17:34.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> And maybe, one day,</font>

17:34.259 --> 17:36.194
<font color="#00FFFF"> you find new family.</font>

17:38.259 --> 17:42.193
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Who fancies a pint, then? </font>I'm
gasping. You're buying, though.</font>

17:42.194 --> 17:43.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wait up, guys!</font>

17:46.260 --> 17:48.659
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Ohh. He stinks. </font>He does a bit.</font>

17:48.660 --> 17:49.794
<font color="#11FF11"> Mm.</font>

17:52.259 --> 17:56.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Only real issue is core strength.
That's known as a Norwegian picnic -</font>

17:56.259 --> 17:58.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> you won't make many babies that way,</font>

17:58.259 --> 18:02.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> but it sure is a lot of fun.
A lot of fun! Ha!</font>

18:02.259 --> 18:03.392
<font color="#00FFFF"> A Himalayan campsite</font>

18:03.393 --> 18:06.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> is an altogether more
complicated position,</font>

18:06.259 --> 18:09.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> involving four people
and a rope swing.</font>

18:09.259 --> 18:11.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> Now, the key to that is good
ballast...</font>

18:13.259 --> 18:16.793
Morning! Little treat for my
favourite builders! Oink-oink!

18:16.794 --> 18:19.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Bacon roll?</font>
Oh, yeah, lovely, thank you.</font>

18:19.259 --> 18:21.060
<font color="#11FF11"> Cheers! </font>Have a lovely day.

18:21.061 --> 18:23.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Cheers! </font>Thank you.
Have a lovely day.

18:23.259 --> 18:24.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Mmm!</font>

18:24.260 --> 18:27.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Mmm! What's with the bag? </font>Gym.</font>

18:27.259 --> 18:29.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> The pub figured me out pretty
quickly, so...</font>

18:29.194 --> 18:31.258
Why don't you have a spa break
while you're at it?

18:31.259 --> 18:33.258
Mike, we can't afford
to be joining gyms.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's a trial day. It's free.</font>

18:34.927 --> 18:36.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> How are you getting on with your
wheeling and dealing?</font>

18:36.527 --> 18:39.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> Good, actually.</font>
Well, I've got to go.</font>

18:39.393 --> 18:41.193
<font color="#FFFF00"> I've actually really got to go.</font>

18:41.194 --> 18:42.527
<font color="#00FFFF"> Morning. </font>Morning!

18:43.660 --> 18:45.258
Morning, Terry!

18:45.259 --> 18:47.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> How are you? </font>Yeah, fine.</font>

18:47.259 --> 18:50.258
Just wondering if we could have
a chat about the drainage issue

18:50.259 --> 18:52.258
and see if we can come to
some sort of arrangement.

18:52.259 --> 18:53.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, yeah,
we'll find time for that.</font>

18:53.260 --> 18:56.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, we're going to finish off
that internal lattice work today</font>

18:56.259 --> 18:58.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> so I need you to take
those curtains down.</font>

18:58.259 --> 19:01.259
Can do, Terry. And I've got some
bacon rolls going, if you fancy one.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I'm a vegan.</font>

19:03.259 --> 19:04.259
Of course you are.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.258
SOFT GRUNT
Oh, God!

19:06.259 --> 19:08.259
HE CHUCKLES

19:11.259 --> 19:12.926
<font color="#11FF11"> Morning!</font>

19:12.927 --> 19:15.060
<font color="#11FF11"> Hey, guys. Hey, Wixy!</font>

19:15.061 --> 19:17.258
TURNING UP MUSIC

19:17.259 --> 19:19.258
# In my imagination there
is no hesitation

19:19.259 --> 19:21.258
# We walk together hand in hand

19:21.259 --> 19:23.258
# I'm dreaming

19:23.259 --> 19:25.258
# You fell in love with me

19:25.259 --> 19:27.258
# Like I'm in love with you

19:27.259 --> 19:29.258
# But dreaming's all I do

19:29.259 --> 19:31.258
# If only they'd come true... #

19:31.259 --> 19:33.660
SINGING ALONG SOFTLY

19:35.259 --> 19:36.259
Oh...

19:36.260 --> 19:37.260
Ah!

19:45.259 --> 19:48.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> CAPTAIN: </font>Look at that!
This could be our chance!</font>

19:48.259 --> 19:50.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> But we'll need help. Fetch Mary.</font>

19:52.794 --> 19:55.194
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't push me,
you cack-faced turnips.</font>

19:57.259 --> 19:59.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Come quickly!</font>
SHE GASPS

19:59.259 --> 20:01.258
<font color="#11FF11"> 'Tis the Devil's work!</font>

20:01.259 --> 20:03.193

He is amongst us.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF"> Quick! </font>The Devil?

20:04.259 --> 20:05.526
What are you talking about?

20:05.527 --> 20:07.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, quick as you like!</font>

20:07.260 --> 20:10.258
<font color="#11FF11">Right, here we go.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Come on, be quick.</font>

20:10.259 --> 20:11.659
<font color="#00FFFF"> All right. Don't pressure me,
don't pressure me.</font>

20:11.660 --> 20:13.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Go on! You know what to do, push.</font>

20:13.259 --> 20:14.660
<font color="#FFFF00"> Push! Come on.</font>
JULIAN STRAINS

20:16.259 --> 20:17.259
What? What is it?

20:17.260 --> 20:20.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, I just thoughts I saw a swan.</font>

20:20.259 --> 20:21.259
What?

20:21.260 --> 20:26.258
<font color="#11FF11"> When we used to see a swan in our
village, that was the Devil at play.</font>

20:26.259 --> 20:28.659
Well, nowadays that just means
that there's a swan.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, right.</font>

20:30.259 --> 20:32.259
Look, there's loads of swans.

20:34.259 --> 20:35.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Then the Devil is busy.</font>

20:37.259 --> 20:39.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> STRAINING</font>
Come on, man! Come on.</font>

20:39.259 --> 20:40.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Push it!</font>

20:40.260 --> 20:41.260
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes! You've got it.</font>

20:41.261 --> 20:44.259
It's in! <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Well done, Jul...</font>
Oh, here we go, here we go.</font>

20:44.260 --> 20:47.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, good Lord,
he's actually going to take it.</font>

20:47.259 --> 20:49.258
<font color="#FFFF00">He's taking the box. </font>Take it,
take it! <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> He's taking the box!</font>

20:49.259 --> 20:50.259
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Yes! </font>Yes!</font>

20:50.260 --> 20:53.259
<font color="#11FF11"> That one be Lucifer's lackey,
for sure.</font>

20:56.660 --> 20:59.194
<font color="#11FF11"> No, wait, I also saw a goose!</font>

21:13.259 --> 21:15.258
Just a couple of chaps
in the library... <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Hi.</font>

21:15.259 --> 21:18.060
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Hello there. </font>Just a couple
of chaps in the library.</font>

21:18.061 --> 21:19.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Er, everything all right with you?</font>

21:19.259 --> 21:21.258
No! No, I've lost
my engagement ring.

21:21.259 --> 21:23.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, no. </font>Oh, no!</font>

21:23.260 --> 21:27.926
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, dear. Listen, we don't want to
be a couple of telltale-tits,</font>

21:27.927 --> 21:30.258
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> but... </font>Julian, er, saw...</font>

21:30.259 --> 21:32.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, I saw one of the builders</font>

21:32.259 --> 21:34.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> heading out of the east wing
just moments ago</font>

21:34.259 --> 21:37.258
<font color="#11FF11"> looking tres, tres shifty.</font>
Which one?

21:37.259 --> 21:38.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> The handsome one.</font>

21:38.527 --> 21:42.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Erm, the... chap with the arms.
Very strong.</font>

21:42.259 --> 21:44.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Probably. </font>What?</font>

21:44.259 --> 21:45.259
Thanks.

21:51.259 --> 21:52.926
<font color="#11FF11"> I am actually pretty gobsmacked</font>

21:52.927 --> 21:55.392
<font color="#11FF11"> that you think it might've
been one of us.</font>

21:55.393 --> 21:58.259
Please, I just need you to open your
bags so I can check.

21:58.260 --> 22:01.794
<font color="#00FFFF"> LADY BUTTON: </font>Come on!
Empty your pockets, riffraff!</font>

22:05.259 --> 22:06.259
<font color="#11FF11"> All right.</font>

22:07.259 --> 22:08.393
<font color="#FFFF00"> There you go.</font>

22:13.259 --> 22:15.258
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Uh-oh. </font>Oh, dear.</font>

22:15.259 --> 22:16.259
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Sticky fingers! </font>Hmm.</font>

22:16.259 --> 22:17.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Is this it?</font>

22:19.061 --> 22:21.258
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm so sorry.
I didn't even know it was in there.</font>

22:21.259 --> 22:23.060
<font color="#11FF11"> I didn't take it, honest.</font>

22:23.061 --> 22:24.392
Ho-ho-ho! <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Likely story.</font>
Chinny reckon.</font>

22:24.393 --> 22:27.259
<font color="#11FF11"> It could have been knocked off
the workbench!</font>

22:31.259 --> 22:33.258
You are so right.

22:33.259 --> 22:36.060
Yep. And I'm... I'm so sorry.

22:36.061 --> 22:37.258
<font color="#11FF11"> TERRY: </font>It's a bit late
for that, Alison.</font>

22:37.259 --> 22:39.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Today is going to be our last day.</font>

22:39.259 --> 22:41.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Get in it! </font>No, please don't go.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.259
Look, it's not my fault.

22:42.260 --> 22:45.258
I've been under a lot of stress
lately and...

22:45.259 --> 22:48.258
Would it help if I told you that
this house is haunted

22:48.259 --> 22:50.659
and I am being plagued by ghosts
who are making my life a misery?

22:50.660 --> 22:52.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Not really, no.</font>

22:52.259 --> 22:55.194
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ooh! A carriage! Someone's coming!</font>

23:05.259 --> 23:06.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Carol!</font>

23:17.794 --> 23:21.259
OK. You win.
What do you want me to say to them?

23:21.260 --> 23:23.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> I've had a think, Alison,</font>

23:23.527 --> 23:26.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I've decided it's best
you don't say anything.</font>

23:26.259 --> 23:28.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't want them to worry about me.</font>

23:28.259 --> 23:31.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let them get on with their lives,
and I'll get on with my...</font>

23:31.527 --> 23:33.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..death.</font>

24:09.259 --> 24:12.193
<font color="#11FF11"> See you, then, mate.
Sorry it didn't work out.</font>

24:12.194 --> 24:13.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? You're leaving?</font>

24:13.259 --> 24:18.061
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, it all got a bit... you know?</font>

24:23.259 --> 24:25.258
So, Pat, I did talk to them,

24:25.259 --> 24:27.258
but I didn't tell them about you.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.392
I asked about them.

24:28.393 --> 24:30.258
I figured you might like to know

24:30.259 --> 24:32.258
that your son Daley
is an accountant.

24:32.259 --> 24:33.259
He's very happy.

24:33.260 --> 24:37.258
Carol's busy with the bowls club
and Morris is very sweet too,

24:37.259 --> 24:39.259
but unbelievably small.

24:42.259 --> 24:43.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Thank you.</font>

24:43.260 --> 24:45.259
Oh, and they called him Pat.

24:47.259 --> 24:50.060
Your grandson.

24:50.061 --> 24:51.259
BABY CRYING

25:09.259 --> 25:10.260
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's got my legs!</font>

25:22.259 --> 25:26.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Guys, I've got a grandson
and his name's Pat.</font>

25:26.259 --> 25:28.194
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I'm so proud I could burst.</font>

25:30.259 --> 25:32.393
HE GASPS AND PANTS

25:34.259 --> 25:36.061
<font color="#FFFF00"> Guys, this is it!</font>

25:37.259 --> 25:40.526
<font color="#FFFF00"> I feel great. I think I'm moving on!</font>

25:40.527 --> 25:43.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can see the light.
Can you see the light?</font>

25:43.259 --> 25:44.659
<font color="#FFFF00"> You were all my family in a way,</font>

25:44.660 --> 25:48.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I loved you all, apart from
Julian, who I didn't really trust,</font>

25:48.259 --> 25:51.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> and, Lady Button, you need
to chill out, just relax, OK?</font>

25:51.259 --> 25:54.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> And, Captain, the war's over, man.
It's over...</font>

25:54.259 --> 25:56.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> And... </font>That's it, then, Wixy.</font>

25:56.259 --> 25:58.260
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Yeah. </font>We'll come back for the rest.</font>

26:00.259 --> 26:02.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ah, this is awkward.</font>

26:04.194 --> 26:05.526
<font color="#00FFFF"> No...</font>

26:05.527 --> 26:09.258
<font color="#00FFFF"> Bye, Wixy. Bye, Kevin.</font>

26:09.259 --> 26:10.260
<font color="#00FFFF"> Bye, lunchbox.</font>

26:16.259 --> 26:18.926
<font color="#11FF11"> A baby. That's nice.</font>

26:18.927 --> 26:21.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Still not quite sure
how they're made.</font>

26:21.259 --> 26:22.259
Oh, erm....

26:25.259 --> 26:28.259
And...
MONKEYS SCREECHING

26:30.527 --> 26:32.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Really?</font>

26:32.259 --> 26:35.926
<font color="#00FFFF"> Do they love each other? </font>I hope so.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Terry just said they were leaving.
What's going on?</font>

26:38.259 --> 26:41.258
The charm offensive
became... offensive.

26:41.259 --> 26:43.194
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, no deal on the drainage?</font>

26:44.194 --> 26:45.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it's held out this long.</font>

26:45.259 --> 26:47.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's not as if...</font>
SPLASHING

26:47.259 --> 26:49.258
Oh, no.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Huh!</font>

26:54.259 --> 26:55.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison... </font>Argh!

26:55.260 --> 26:56.659
Please stop doing that!

26:56.660 --> 26:58.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I was blocked,</font>

26:58.259 --> 26:59.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> but that has passed.</font>

26:59.927 --> 27:03.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I have composed a poem
to express my feelings.</font>

27:03.259 --> 27:05.793
Sure. "Alison, we'll respect
your boundaries.

27:05.794 --> 27:08.258
"It's bedtime so we'll probably
stay out of your room."

27:08.259 --> 27:13.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm dreaming
that you're in love with me</font>

27:13.259 --> 27:15.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> Like I'm in love with you...</font>

27:16.260 --> 27:19.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> But dreaming's all I do</font>

27:19.259 --> 27:21.926
<font color="#FFFF00"> If only they'd come true</font>

27:21.927 --> 27:25.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> I should be so lucky</font>

27:25.259 --> 27:29.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Lucky, lucky, lucky...</font>

27:29.259 --> 27:33.258
<font color="#11FF11"> BOTH: </font>I should be so lucky...</font>

27:33.259 --> 27:34.259
In love?

27:34.260 --> 27:38.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> What magic is this?
Our minds are entwined.</font>

27:38.259 --> 27:40.060
<font color="#FFFF00"> How do you know my verse?</font>

27:40.061 --> 27:43.258
Oh, I hate to tell you this,
but that is Kylie Minogue.

27:43.259 --> 27:45.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> What is a Kylie Min-ohg?</font>

27:45.259 --> 27:47.259
She's an Australian singer,

27:47.260 --> 27:49.258
and that's one of her songs.

27:49.259 --> 27:52.258
I think you might have heard it
on the radio.

27:52.259 --> 27:53.526
It's catchy, isn't it?

27:53.527 --> 27:56.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> HE GASPS</font>
What have I done?</font>

27:56.259 --> 27:59.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> Please send correspondence
to Miss Minogue,</font>

27:59.259 --> 28:01.392
<font color="#FFFF00"> apologising in the sincerest
possible terms</font>

28:01.393 --> 28:04.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> for stealing her beautiful words.</font>

28:04.259 --> 28:07.258
<font color="#FFFF00"> The shame is almost
too much to bear!</font>

28:07.259 --> 28:08.793
<font color="#FFFF00"> What have I done?!</font>

28:08.794 --> 28:10.392
SHE LAUGHS

28:10.393 --> 28:12.258
<font color="#11FF11"> What's so funny?</font>

28:12.259 --> 28:14.258
Oh... No, it doesn't matter.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.659
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't help you
with the drains.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.258
Never mind those ghosts,
I think this house

28:18.259 --> 28:20.258
<font color="#11FF11"> is going to finish us off! </font>No.</font>

28:20.259 --> 28:22.258
<font color="#11FF11"> We'll figure it out. Or rob a bank.</font>

28:22.259 --> 28:24.258
<font color="#11FF11"> And you know what?</font>

28:24.259 --> 28:27.258
<font color="#11FF11"> I won't let them get to me, either.</font>

28:27.259 --> 28:28.659
Ooh, the full monty!

28:28.660 --> 28:30.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah!</font>

28:30.259 --> 28:32.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Here I am. Huh?</font>

28:32.259 --> 28:35.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Come on! I'm not afraid of you!</font>

28:35.259 --> 28:36.259
<font color="#11FF11"> Hah! Get a good look!</font>

28:36.260 --> 28:38.659
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't care. Watch it!</font>

28:38.660 --> 28:41.258
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, not scaring me. I'm not...</font>

28:41.259 --> 28:42.259
<font color="#11FF11"> IN THE DISTANCE: </font>..scared!</font>

28:42.260 --> 28:44.258
OWL HOOTS

28:44.259 --> 28:45.260
<font color="#00FFFF"> CLUNKING</font>
What was that?</font>

28:47.194 --> 28:48.259
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's probably nothing.</font>

28:49.305 --> 28:55.728
