WEBVTT

00:09.346 --> 00:12.881
Um... Dez?

00:12.883 --> 00:14.583
What are you doing?

00:14.585 --> 00:16.451
Trying out for the
school play tomorrow.

00:16.453 --> 00:17.953
I'm auditioning for
the role of...

00:17.955 --> 00:20.489
Blacksmith.

00:20.491 --> 00:23.725
Last time I checked, there was no
Blacksmith in "sleeping beauty."

00:23.727 --> 00:25.327
Aww!

00:25.329 --> 00:28.363
I guess I ruined this
trumpet for nothing.

00:28.365 --> 00:30.532
I'm trying out too.

00:30.534 --> 00:32.968
I'm gonna be playing
prince carmine.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.937
Hey, sleeping beauty!

00:35.939 --> 00:38.373
Don't make me kiss you! Oh!

00:39.942 --> 00:42.244
Austin, it's not prince Carmine.

00:42.246 --> 00:43.211
It's prince charming.

00:43.213 --> 00:46.648
I knew that.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.686
I'm auditioning for the
role of sleeping beauty.

00:51.688 --> 00:54.191
Well, you're not gonna get it,
'cause I'm trying out too.

00:54.858 --> 00:58.460
Ooh, two best friends
going after the same role

00:58.462 --> 01:00.595
and only one can get the part...

01:00.597 --> 01:02.230
It's not a big deal.

01:02.232 --> 01:03.765
Whoever's better
will get the part.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.300
- Hm-hmm.
- No hard feelings.

01:05.302 --> 01:07.002
But it's gonna be me.

01:07.004 --> 01:08.970
- Oh ho ho ho!
- Snap!

01:08.972 --> 01:10.034
I don't think so.

01:10.065 --> 01:12.941
Please, I know my lines
backwards and forwards.

01:12.943 --> 01:15.877
"I am sleeping beauty
and that is my castle.

01:15.879 --> 01:18.780
Castle my is that and
beauty sleeping am I."

01:20.016 --> 01:23.418
I am not impressed.
Impressed not am I.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.720
Now, let me show you
how a pro does it.

01:25.722 --> 01:28.023
This is how you play
sleeping beauty.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.568
I think she's actually sleeping.

01:44.608 --> 01:47.609
Wow, she's good.

01:47.611 --> 01:49.010
Real good.

02:46.770 --> 02:49.437
Thanks for auditioning for
sleeping beauty, everyone.

02:49.439 --> 02:51.373
Great hustle out there today.

02:52.675 --> 02:55.343
Unfortunately, you can't
all make the team.

02:55.345 --> 02:59.080
So, playing the role of
prince charming is...

02:59.082 --> 03:01.383
Dez.

03:03.954 --> 03:05.554
- What?
- Oh man!

03:05.556 --> 03:07.522
I wanted to be the Blacksmith.

03:08.925 --> 03:11.026
But what about me?

03:11.028 --> 03:14.129
Moon, you're gonna
be townsfolk ♪2.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.532
♪ 2?!

03:17.534 --> 03:19.901
You'd think I'd at
least be townsfolk ♪1.

03:19.903 --> 03:22.704
No, townsfolk ♪1 is Ally Dawson.

03:22.706 --> 03:24.506
What?

03:24.508 --> 03:26.908
Um...

03:26.910 --> 03:29.544
But I auditioned for
sleeping beauty.

03:29.546 --> 03:32.948
Yes, you did, and you'll
make a great townsfolk.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.052
The role of sleeping
beauty goes to...

03:37.054 --> 03:38.553
Trish de la Rosa.

03:38.555 --> 03:40.722
Oh, yes!

03:40.724 --> 03:46.394
I've never seen anyone sleep
with such authority and passion!

03:47.496 --> 03:49.464
It's just sleeping.

03:49.466 --> 03:51.967
A baby could do it.

03:51.969 --> 03:55.103
And here's a list of
who's playing what.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.641
I'm gonna be the narrator.

03:59.643 --> 04:00.976
- Huh?!
- What?

04:00.978 --> 04:02.143
I'm gonna be the narrator.

04:02.145 --> 04:04.012
You're gonna be the narrator?!

04:06.549 --> 04:10.418
I wanted to be sleeping beauty,
but I'm gonna be a wicked witch.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.587
I'm furious about it!

04:16.091 --> 04:17.826
You'll be great, Trish.

04:17.827 --> 04:19.879
When I saw you up there
sleeping, I just knew

04:19.910 --> 04:21.796
there was no way I was
gonna get the role.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.965
- Oh, thanks, Margo.
- Hm-hmm.

04:26.769 --> 04:29.004
Okay, you can stop
hugging me now.

04:29.006 --> 04:31.673
Sorry, I'm just
so happy for you.

04:31.675 --> 04:33.008
Thank you.

04:33.010 --> 04:35.076
This stinks.

04:35.078 --> 04:39.014
I didn't even get a name,
just townsfolk ♪1.

04:39.016 --> 04:42.484
Why not "Julie who
lives in the town"?

04:42.486 --> 04:45.120
Well, it could be worse.

04:45.122 --> 04:47.455
We could be playing
one of the trees.

04:47.457 --> 04:50.492
Guys, I'm playing
one of the trees!

04:50.494 --> 04:53.028
That's great, babe.
That's what you wanted.

04:58.601 --> 05:03.938
Oh, sleeping beauty, I shall now awaken
you from your slumber with a kiss.

05:07.043 --> 05:08.977
Okay! That's enough
rehearsal for now.

05:08.979 --> 05:11.046
I'm sorry. Did I mess that up?

05:11.048 --> 05:13.515
No, babe, you were great.
Best tree ever!

05:13.517 --> 05:15.750
Are you sure? I can't decide
between an oak tree...

05:16.919 --> 05:18.987
Or a pine tree.

05:18.989 --> 05:21.890
Hmm, can you do an elm tree?

05:21.892 --> 05:23.925
I think.

05:25.127 --> 05:27.028
That's the one.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.865
Ahh, you decided to
go with elm tree.

05:30.867 --> 05:33.134
Good choice.

05:33.136 --> 05:35.904
Maybe we should go over
our lines again, Austin.

05:35.906 --> 05:37.872
You mean our line?

05:37.874 --> 05:40.575
We only have one line each and
you've already made me rehearse it

05:40.577 --> 05:41.776
for like three hours.

05:41.778 --> 05:44.012
And you haven't
done it right yet.

05:44.014 --> 05:46.081
Try it with prince charming.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.717
Fine. Dez?

05:48.719 --> 05:51.286
Excuse me, townsfolk,

05:51.288 --> 05:52.721
do you know where I can find...

05:52.723 --> 05:54.556
Sleeping beauty?

05:54.558 --> 05:56.891
She's in that castle...

05:56.893 --> 05:58.293
Over yonder.

05:59.829 --> 06:01.830
That's not how you're
gonna do it, is it?

06:01.832 --> 06:03.698
It's just two words.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.233
There's only so many
ways you can say it.

06:05.235 --> 06:06.901
Over yonder.

06:06.903 --> 06:08.903
<i>Over yonder.</i>

06:08.905 --> 06:10.538
<i>Over yonder.</i>

06:10.540 --> 06:12.674
And all of those are wrong.

06:13.909 --> 06:15.076
Hey, check it out.

06:15.078 --> 06:16.845
They have a website
for the play.

06:16.847 --> 06:19.114
A bunch of people have comments.

06:19.116 --> 06:21.583
"Trish is gonna be a
great sleeping beauty."

06:21.585 --> 06:24.152
- Hm, I agree.
- Oh, look at this one.

06:24.154 --> 06:25.987
"I've seen Trish
fall asleep in class

06:25.989 --> 06:28.123
and I can't wait to see
her do it on stage."

06:28.125 --> 06:30.725
Nice.

06:30.727 --> 06:33.261
Did anyone say anything
about the townsfolk?

06:33.263 --> 06:35.029
Oh, here's another
one about Trish.

06:35.031 --> 06:36.965
"Trish stinks like
rotten onions.

06:36.967 --> 06:40.635
They should call the play
'stinking beautey.'"

06:40.637 --> 06:43.104
well, that wasn't very nice...

06:43.106 --> 06:46.107
And they spelled "beauty" wrong.

06:46.109 --> 06:47.742
It's okay.

06:47.744 --> 06:49.978
People can say whatever they want.
I don't care.

06:51.947 --> 06:56.151
I'm glad you feel that way, but you might
not want to read the next comment.

06:59.155 --> 07:02.791
"Trish isn't pretty enough to
be playing sleeping beauty.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.827
They should call the play,
'sleeping not-beautey.'"

07:11.333 --> 07:13.902
they spelled "beauty"
wrong again.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.145
And did I mention you
look great today?

07:24.147 --> 07:26.948
- And you smell great.
- Is that a new perfume?

07:26.950 --> 07:29.250
Guys, I know what you're doing.

07:29.252 --> 07:32.620
And you can stop. I'm
fine, I promise.

07:32.622 --> 07:35.123
I'm not gonna get upset about
some stupid comments online.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.258
What about stupid
comments on our locker?

07:40.162 --> 07:42.997
Hmm, a bar of soap and
a cracked mirror.

07:42.999 --> 07:43.863
Oh, let me guess.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.000
I looked into it and
that's what broke it.

07:46.002 --> 07:47.869
Hilarious.

07:47.871 --> 07:50.171
Hey, this isn't funny!

07:50.173 --> 07:52.373
Trish is our friend.
You mess with her,

07:52.375 --> 07:54.642
- you mess with us.
- Yeah, this stops now.

07:56.946 --> 07:59.781
Okay, now, this stops now.

08:01.685 --> 08:04.419
I think they got it now.

08:04.421 --> 08:06.788
Dez, thanks, but I'm fine.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.423
This kind of stuff
doesn't bother me.

08:08.425 --> 08:11.092
Joke's on you guys.

08:11.094 --> 08:12.760
Lavender's my favorite.

08:12.762 --> 08:14.262
Aah.

08:16.332 --> 08:20.902
Wow, Trish is being
so cool about this.

08:20.904 --> 08:22.337
Yeah, I'm more
upset than she is.

08:22.339 --> 08:24.772
Doesn't surprise me.

08:24.774 --> 08:27.909
Trish isn't gonna let some
misspelled insults get her down.

08:27.911 --> 08:30.345
She's as tough as it gets.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.142
Hey, Trish, do you
think my character,

09:01.144 --> 09:03.356
Julie who lives in the town,
should hold a loaf of bread?

09:03.380 --> 09:05.213
Because...

09:06.882 --> 09:08.316
Are you crying?

09:08.318 --> 09:10.418
Yes.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.021
I'm practicing for the
crying part of the play.

09:13.023 --> 09:14.923
The part where s...

09:14.925 --> 09:16.991
sleeping beauty stubs her toe?

09:20.096 --> 09:24.265
Why would someone say such
mean things about me?

09:24.267 --> 09:31.105
Who knows? Maybe they're insecure
or jealous or just plain mean.

09:31.107 --> 09:33.508
Don't listen to them.

09:33.510 --> 09:35.476
You're the most
beautiful girl I know.

09:39.081 --> 09:44.452
Thanks, Ally, but don't tell
the boys that I'm upset.

09:44.454 --> 09:47.055
- Because then...
- Hey, Trish.

09:47.057 --> 09:50.191
Are you crying?

09:50.193 --> 09:52.794
Yes, I'm upset, okay?

09:52.796 --> 09:55.229
But don't tell Dez
or anything...

09:55.231 --> 09:56.798
- Because, I...
- Hey, Trish.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.100
Are you crying?

09:59.102 --> 10:03.104
Yes, I'm upset, but I don't
want to talk about it.

10:03.106 --> 10:05.139
And please don't
tell anyone else

10:05.141 --> 10:06.341
- because...
- Hey, Trish.

10:06.343 --> 10:08.076
Are you crying?

10:08.078 --> 10:10.011
Yes.

10:10.013 --> 10:12.280
How many people can
fit in this room?

10:22.291 --> 10:27.862
Excuse me, townsfolk, do you know
where I can find sleeping beauty?

10:27.864 --> 10:30.331
She's in that castle.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.133
Over yonder.

10:36.071 --> 10:40.141
Please, give her this bread and
tell her Julie says hello.

10:40.143 --> 10:42.143
Stick to the script!

10:46.815 --> 10:49.584
Meanwhile, back at the castle.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.185
- Huh?!
- Wait, what?

10:53.188 --> 10:57.892
You're gonna sleep for 100 years
because I totally put a curse on you!

10:57.894 --> 11:00.261
Yay, evil!

11:01.864 --> 11:04.032
Cut!

11:04.034 --> 11:06.601
Margo, I know you're
just subbing for Trish

11:06.603 --> 11:09.904
while she's out sick, but you
got to keep your eyes shut.

11:09.906 --> 11:13.007
I know. I'm just not as
good of a sleeper as Trish.

11:13.009 --> 11:15.143
How much longer is
she gonna be sick?

11:15.145 --> 11:18.212
Well, if she's not better soon,
you'll be playing sleeping beauty,

11:18.214 --> 11:19.538
so you'd better work on it.

11:19.569 --> 11:22.050
I will. I'll go home and
practice sleeping tonight

11:22.052 --> 11:24.185
for... for at least
eight to 10 hours.

11:25.554 --> 11:29.924
- You, less perky.
- Okay!

11:29.926 --> 11:33.961
You, lose the bread and
your name's not Julie.

11:33.963 --> 11:35.496
And, you...

11:35.498 --> 11:38.266
Great job with that
"over yonder."

11:44.173 --> 11:46.374
Don't feel bad, Margo.
You're doing great.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.376
Thanks, Ally.

11:48.378 --> 11:49.644
Oh.

11:51.113 --> 11:53.181
Okay, you can let go of me now.

11:53.183 --> 11:54.449
Oop.

11:56.218 --> 11:58.186
That girl sure likes to hug.

11:58.188 --> 12:00.722
So what's the deal with Trish?

12:00.724 --> 12:02.457
She hasn't been to
school for three days.

12:02.459 --> 12:05.093
I keep trying to call her, but
she hasn't been answering.

12:05.095 --> 12:07.161
<i>She must be really sick.</i>

12:07.163 --> 12:08.963
Carrie and I saw her down
at shredders last night

12:08.965 --> 12:11.232
- and she looked fine.
- What?!

12:11.234 --> 12:15.236
She says she has this weird flu that
only affects her during school hours.

12:23.278 --> 12:24.579
Hey, Ally.

12:24.581 --> 12:26.314
I mean...

12:26.316 --> 12:27.682
Hey, Ally.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.285
I know you're not sick.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.956
Fine, you got me.

12:36.658 --> 12:38.960
Trish, this is ridiculous.

12:38.962 --> 12:41.496
I'm your best friend. You
didn't have to lie to me.

12:41.498 --> 12:43.164
I didn't want to
get you involved.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.999
It was my problem, not yours.

12:45.001 --> 12:47.335
But you don't have to
deal with this alone.

12:47.337 --> 12:48.536
I'm here for you.

12:49.705 --> 12:53.074
You know what, I'm gonna go online
and give the person who started this

12:53.076 --> 12:54.475
a piece of my mind.

12:54.477 --> 12:56.344
Ha!

12:56.346 --> 12:58.412
"'Sleeping not-beautey'?

12:58.414 --> 13:00.515
Well, you spelled
'beauty' wrong.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.717
It's just 'y, ' not 'e-y.'

13:02.719 --> 13:06.120
you better spell-check yourself
before you wreck yourself."

13:07.389 --> 13:09.223
Ally, you don't get it.

13:09.225 --> 13:11.192
This stuff was hard
enough to ignore

13:11.194 --> 13:13.060
when it was just some
random online bully.

13:13.062 --> 13:15.129
Now it's out of control.

13:15.131 --> 13:18.566
People have been posting mean
pictures, prank-calling me.

13:18.568 --> 13:21.335
I can't even walk down the halls
without everyone laughing at me.

13:21.337 --> 13:25.506
I understand, but you can't just
keep calling in sick every day.

13:25.508 --> 13:28.509
You're right. I can't.

13:28.511 --> 13:31.245
Good. I'm glad you
agree with me.

13:31.247 --> 13:33.080
That's why I'm dropping
out of school.

13:44.726 --> 13:47.395
I never thought Trish
would quit school.

13:47.397 --> 13:49.664
I know. It's weird.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.666
It's not like her
to quit something.

13:51.668 --> 13:56.037
I mean, sure, she gets fired
a lot, but she never quits.

13:56.039 --> 13:57.705
I know how she feels.

13:57.707 --> 14:01.409
There is always somebody who has
something nasty to say after we perform.

14:01.411 --> 14:05.012
I just wish we could make Trish
realize that we have her back.

14:05.014 --> 14:07.381
I know.

14:07.383 --> 14:10.084
How about we do what we do best?

14:10.086 --> 14:11.752
Yeah!

14:11.754 --> 14:14.021
We'll put on a puppet show!

14:15.557 --> 14:18.025
I meant write a song.

14:18.027 --> 14:20.361
Right...

14:20.363 --> 14:22.463
That the puppets will sing.

14:29.338 --> 14:31.172
So how are those posters coming?

14:31.174 --> 14:34.175
The show's tonight and I
want butts in bleachers.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.043
Mine's done.

14:36.045 --> 14:38.346
Well, except for the
spelling, good job.

14:38.348 --> 14:41.082
Wait a minute, look how
Margo spelled "beauty."

14:41.084 --> 14:43.217
"B-e-a-u-t-e-y."

14:43.219 --> 14:44.652
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:44.654 --> 14:49.123
Yeah, it's not
"e-y." It's "e-e-e."

14:49.125 --> 14:51.225
No, Margo's the bully.

14:51.227 --> 14:54.528
You mean, the "b-u-l-l-e-e-e"?

14:54.530 --> 14:56.497
Yeah, close enough.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.640
Hey, Trish, listen. I
just wanted to say...

15:05.642 --> 15:07.675
if you're here to talk me
into coming back to school,

15:07.677 --> 15:09.076
you're wasting your breath.

15:09.078 --> 15:11.612
I keep trying to tell
you we're here for you,

15:11.614 --> 15:13.681
but you don't seem
to be hearing me.

15:13.683 --> 15:16.117
You left us no choice.

15:16.119 --> 15:18.152
We had to write you a song.
Come on.

15:19.288 --> 15:20.721
Hit it, Austin.

16:29.759 --> 16:33.227
Oh, thanks, guys.

16:33.229 --> 16:34.495
That was beautiful.

16:36.431 --> 16:38.666
But I just can't show my
face at school again.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.468
Sorry.

16:42.838 --> 16:45.473
I told you we should
have done a puppet show.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.575
Right, Mr. sock-imoto?

17:01.390 --> 17:03.491
Oh, there you guys are.

17:03.493 --> 17:05.192
The song didn't work.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.394
Trish isn't coming.

17:06.396 --> 17:07.895
Too bad.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.364
She'll miss us getting back
at Margo during the play.

17:10.366 --> 17:12.800
Wait, get back at Margo?

17:12.801 --> 17:14.702
Yeah, Margo's the bully.

17:14.704 --> 17:17.338
- Margo's the bully?!
- Margo's the bully?!

17:17.339 --> 17:19.373
Margo's the bully?!

17:19.375 --> 17:21.742
I told you to put
that thing away.

17:21.743 --> 17:23.344
Sorry.

17:24.279 --> 17:25.780
Okay, guys, game time.

17:25.781 --> 17:28.249
The play's starting. Let's go.
Let's go.

17:28.251 --> 17:30.217
Move it! Come on.

17:30.219 --> 17:31.652
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.318
What do you think they meant
by "get back at Margo"?

17:35.223 --> 17:36.724
And don't answer with a puppet.

17:47.937 --> 17:49.804
- What?!
- Huh?!

17:56.978 --> 17:59.780
Today is my sixteenth birthday.

17:59.782 --> 18:02.483
I'm the happiest
princess in the land.

18:03.418 --> 18:05.886
Happy Birthday.

18:08.256 --> 18:13.627
Prince charming, you're two
acts and 100 years early.

18:13.629 --> 18:16.464
This isn't in the script.

18:16.466 --> 18:20.000
I have a present for you.

18:20.002 --> 18:22.369
I wasn't expecting a gift.

18:22.371 --> 18:23.604
What a surprise.

18:25.441 --> 18:27.274
Open it.

18:27.276 --> 18:29.910
It's a skunk.

18:33.648 --> 18:35.549
This is disgusting!

18:36.918 --> 18:38.486
Dez, what are you doing?

18:38.488 --> 18:40.321
Showing Margo what
it feels like.

18:40.323 --> 18:42.323
Who's stinking beauty now?

18:42.325 --> 18:43.958
That'll teach you to
bully our friend.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.025
Yeah!

18:45.027 --> 18:46.627
Stop!

18:47.996 --> 18:49.630
Trish, you showed up.

18:49.632 --> 18:54.935
Yeah, I decided I was done being a
victim, but I didn't expect to see this.

18:54.937 --> 18:56.937
But Margo's the bully.

18:56.939 --> 19:00.141
Yeah, but making her feel bad
doesn't make me feel any better.

19:00.143 --> 19:03.010
And messing with her makes
you just as bad as she is.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.747
Time out! What's going on here?!

19:06.749 --> 19:10.951
Margo wrote some mean comments about
me online and things got out of hand.

19:10.953 --> 19:12.887
Margo, you did that?

19:12.889 --> 19:16.090
Yes, but... I just
wrote that stuff

19:16.092 --> 19:18.993
because I guess I was jealous.

19:18.995 --> 19:21.495
You really hurt my feelings.

19:21.497 --> 19:23.564
I'm sorry, Trish.

19:23.566 --> 19:24.698
I know you're pretty.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.067
And you definitely don't
smell like onions.

19:27.069 --> 19:29.937
Thanks, I think.

19:29.939 --> 19:33.674
Maybe next time, you'll think twice
before you do something like that.

19:33.676 --> 19:36.577
Margo, we'll discuss this later.

19:36.579 --> 19:39.046
Now, hit the showers.
You smell like skunk.

19:39.048 --> 19:43.851
Trish, you know you could
have come to me, right?

19:43.853 --> 19:45.953
You could always talk to
a parent or a teacher.

19:45.955 --> 19:47.988
I didn't think you'd understand.

19:47.990 --> 19:50.124
A lot of us have dealt with
what you're going through.

19:50.126 --> 19:53.127
When I was a kid, they used to
make fun of my long, curly hair

19:53.129 --> 19:54.695
and my high, squeaky voice.

19:55.897 --> 19:57.364
Seriously?

19:58.433 --> 20:03.003
It took a lot of courage for
you to come here, Trish.

20:03.005 --> 20:07.107
Well, it was easy when I have great
friends like you by my side.

20:07.109 --> 20:10.611
Now let's do this play.

20:10.613 --> 20:12.146
I'm gonna play sleeping beauty,

20:12.148 --> 20:14.682
and I don't care what any
of you people think!

20:14.684 --> 20:16.884
But I hope you like the show.

20:21.089 --> 20:26.727
Excuse me, townsfolk, do you know
where I can find sleeping beauty?

20:26.729 --> 20:29.129
She's in that castle!

20:29.131 --> 20:32.099
Over yonder.

20:33.502 --> 20:38.806
<i>Give her this banana and tell
her Ann-Marie says "bonjour."</i>

20:46.114 --> 20:49.583
I awaken thee with a kiss.

20:54.889 --> 20:58.058
I said I awaken
thee with a kiss.

21:01.663 --> 21:03.831
Guys, I think she's
really asleep.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.534
She's so good.

21:10.505 --> 21:13.007
Ever after.

21:45.507 --> 21:47.775
We think bullying
is a serious issue.

21:47.777 --> 21:49.977
Just to be clear,
we're against it.

21:49.979 --> 21:52.646
Anyone can get bullied. It
doesn't matter who you are.

21:52.648 --> 21:55.049
And check out some of these real
comments people said about us.

21:55.051 --> 21:57.885
"Calum, you got a big forehead."

21:57.887 --> 22:00.154
Seriously?

22:00.156 --> 22:03.358
Oh, here's a clever one.
"Laura is an idiot."

22:03.389 --> 22:04.158
Hmm.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.094
"Raini Rodriguez is annoying
and makes me want to vomit."

22:07.096 --> 22:09.997
Well, I hope you're not watching
this show on a full stomach.

22:09.999 --> 22:13.067
"I hate Ross lynch
because he's ugly,

22:13.069 --> 22:16.070
stupid, weird, untalented,
and he gets on my nerves."

22:16.072 --> 22:18.906
Wow, I think they pretty
much covered everything.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.126
Think before you post, guys.

22:21.156 --> 22:22.876
Are these things you'd
say to someone's face?

22:22.878 --> 22:24.244
How would you feel if
your principal, mom,

22:24.246 --> 22:26.980
- or grandparent saw it?
- Oh, you're lucky

22:26.982 --> 22:28.682
my grandma doesn't know
how to use the Internet.

22:28.684 --> 22:31.151
Because she'd have a thing or two
to say about the idiot comment.

22:31.153 --> 22:35.756
But seriously, as actors,
we're used to mean posts.

22:35.758 --> 22:38.025
We don't like them, but it
just comes with the job.

22:38.027 --> 22:39.727
These are just a
few mean comments.

22:39.729 --> 22:41.995
But if someone's continuously
harassing or insulting you,

22:41.997 --> 22:44.164
that's bullying. You
should let someone know.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.967
Talk to a friend, a
sibling or an adult.

22:46.969 --> 22:49.169
It might not seem like it,
but there's always someone

22:49.171 --> 22:51.538
who'll be able to help.
You're never alone.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.140
And a little piece of advice:

22:53.142 --> 22:58.645
If you're thinking about saying something
mean about someone, just don't.
