Thank you, man !

He tries to do the same joke every year.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.473
Except last year he did it
with a bottle of Jack.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.517
-He was so drunk.
-l hope you like it.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.601
Really?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.311
Compliments of the young lady
at the end of the bar.

00:24.983 --> 00:29.237
-Yo, did she just give you $1 00?
-For your birthday? Bitch !

-l'm not trying to puke today.
-Your loss, buddy.

00:36.578 --> 00:40.498
Yeah, Shilo did enough puking on Saturday.

-SAMMY: Yeah, exactly.

01:01.145 --> 01:05.606

You have more expensive tastes?

-Why. . . Why are you giving me money?
-l'm buying you for the night.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.156

l can't drive that car slow. l love my life.

Oh ! What is the record
for the most illegal things done at one time?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.437
We are breaking it tonight.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.148
Oh, it's fantastic.
Why are we doing this again?

01:47.232 --> 01:49.233
Because l hate my father.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.861
Oh, l hate him ! Oh, l hate him, too.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.686
That practice was horseshit. Curfew.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.982
We haven't had a curfew for this team
in 1 0 years.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.402
You guys want to relive
your senior prom every night,

02:33.946 --> 02:35.822
you do it for somebody else.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.698
Because if you want to play football for me,

02:37.783 --> 02:40.785
you'd better show up on time
and ready to play.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.411
So was she a hooker?

02:42.496 --> 02:45.331
No, no, she wasn't a hooker.
She paid me to blow me

02:45.415 --> 02:47.583
-while driving her Lamborghini.
-What?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.836
l'm not exaggerating.
lt was the best night of my life.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.505
-Oh, did you get her number?
-No.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.341
No, she said she'd find me
if she ever needed to.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.344
All l did was dry-hump Denise. Again.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.514
. . .so you'll be in bed at 9:00 pm every night,
rubbing one out.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.143
Curfew's fine with me.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.105
l won't need to leave the house to get laid.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.941
What the hell is that, Thad?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.611
lt's a pocket pussy.

-Oh, that's cute.
-Oh, ears perking up now.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.494

from a Persian girl last night.

l don't know if you know what that's like.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.301

than banging a piece of plastic.

Uh, and smoking fake weed.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.971
Piece of plastic?
