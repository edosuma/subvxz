00:17.301 --> 00:19.512
<i>Cause of death unknown!</i>

00:19.554 --> 00:22.181
<i>Kaminoan Doctor Nala Se
was unable</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:25.267
<i>to find the cause of
an illness in clone trooper Tup.</i>

00:25.309 --> 00:27.812
<i>In a desperate attempt
to save his friend's life,</i>

00:27.854 --> 00:30.147
<i>Fives located and removed a tumor</i>

00:30.189 --> 00:33.901
<i>from Tup's brain with
the help of Medical droid AZI-3.</i>

00:33.942 --> 00:36.821
<i>Immediately following
the procedure, Tup died,</i>

00:36.863 --> 00:39.990
<i>and Fives was placed under arrest.</i>

00:40.032 --> 00:42.076
<i>Now the tumor is the only hope</i>

00:42.117 --> 00:46.121
<i>to finding answers
for Tup's mysterious illness.</i>

00:59.218 --> 01:01.846
General, what did
the Chancellor say?

01:01.888 --> 01:04.515
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine
wants the tumor

01:04.557 --> 01:07.142
and all
of the intel gathered sent

01:07.184 --> 01:10.229
to the Grand Republic
Medical Facility on Coruscant.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.274
So then I'll be going
to Coruscant as well?

01:13.315 --> 01:16.694
You were not a part
of the Chancellor's request.

01:16.736 --> 01:18.571
<i>I'm sorry, Fives,</i>

01:18.613 --> 01:22.867
but this is a matter best left
to the medical professionals.

01:22.909 --> 01:26.078
There is still
so much we do not know.

01:30.708 --> 01:32.334
Perhaps we would know more

01:32.376 --> 01:35.797
if this clone had not taken
matters into his own hands.

01:35.838 --> 01:37.924
Listen! I was trying
to save my friend!

01:38.006 --> 01:41.135
And yet perhaps
by removing this tumor,

01:41.176 --> 01:42.595
it was you who killed him.

01:42.637 --> 01:44.305
What do you care?

01:44.346 --> 01:47.141
You were going to kill him
anyway and dissect him too.

01:47.182 --> 01:49.644
He's a soldier.
He deserves better!

01:49.685 --> 01:52.187
Stand down, Fives!

01:52.229 --> 01:55.900
Doctor, there is no proof
of your claim.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.696
I want this specimen
and all the data prepared

02:00.738 --> 02:03.991
for transit to the Jedi Temple.

02:04.032 --> 02:06.285
<i>The Chancellor
said the tumor and data</i>

02:06.327 --> 02:10.038
was to be sent directly to the
Medical Facility on Coruscant,

02:10.080 --> 02:11.833
not the Jedi Temple.

02:11.874 --> 02:13.709
And it will get there,

02:13.751 --> 02:17.171
but after the Jedi have run
an analysis on it first.

02:17.212 --> 02:18.631
I protest.

02:18.673 --> 02:20.382
I must personally
deliver the tumor

02:20.424 --> 02:22.217
to the Chancellor
as ordered.

02:22.259 --> 02:24.762
You can protest all you want.

02:24.804 --> 02:27.640
My word is final.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.982
You have one more physical
to pass.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.358
If you are cleared,

02:37.399 --> 02:39.944
you will be sent back to the 501st.

02:43.823 --> 02:46.116
Thank you, General.

02:46.158 --> 02:48.744
It will be good to put
this entire incident

02:48.786 --> 02:51.497
behind you, trooper.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.332
I agree.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.770
AZI-3.

03:14.812 --> 03:17.105
Hello, ARC trooper Fives.

03:17.147 --> 03:19.942
I regret that we were unable
to heal your friend.

03:19.984 --> 03:22.319
Yeah, me too.

03:22.361 --> 03:24.822
Are you going
to be reprogrammed as well?

03:24.864 --> 03:27.909
No, AZI, I'm going back to the front.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.827
That is not what I heard.

03:29.869 --> 03:32.162
I heard your mind
was going to be wiped

03:32.204 --> 03:33.622
<i>and that you would reassigned here</i>

03:33.664 --> 03:35.374
<i>and placed on sanitation detail.</i>

03:35.416 --> 03:37.960
We can still be friends,

03:38.002 --> 03:39.628
assuming we both remember
each other

03:39.670 --> 03:42.339
after our memories
have been erased.

03:43.758 --> 03:47.511
Let's go, CT-5555.

03:47.553 --> 03:49.304
No!

04:02.651 --> 04:04.820
Look what you did!

04:04.862 --> 04:07.448
I cannot
believe what you did.

04:07.489 --> 04:10.200
I am not getting my mind
erased, and neither are you.

04:11.535 --> 04:13.037
Let's get out of here!

04:13.079 --> 04:15.873
Are we escaping?

04:15.915 --> 04:18.250
Oh-oh-oh!

04:22.838 --> 04:24.548
Why are we here?

04:24.590 --> 04:26.341
I knew it.

04:26.383 --> 04:28.052
Nala Se switched the cases.

04:28.094 --> 04:30.596
She's trying
to hide something.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.640
Oh, the tumor?

04:32.681 --> 04:35.643
So we are going
to continue our research?

04:35.684 --> 04:37.019
Yeah, the research.

04:37.061 --> 04:38.437
That's it.
Now, come on!

04:38.479 --> 04:40.898
Whoa!

05:09.593 --> 05:11.512
I'm sorry, sir.

05:11.553 --> 05:13.931
All ships are locked down
during the emergency.

05:13.973 --> 05:15.724
Oh, what about that one?

05:15.766 --> 05:17.434
Hey!

05:25.526 --> 05:27.277
There they are!

05:28.737 --> 05:31.239
Sorry, brother.

05:47.297 --> 05:50.051
I want him brought in alive.

05:50.092 --> 05:51.552
Have that ship tracked.

05:51.593 --> 05:53.054
Yes, ma'am.

05:55.514 --> 05:57.516
Can you float?

05:57.558 --> 06:00.602
I am buoyant
and have several survival modes.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.521
Ah, survival, eh?

06:04.314 --> 06:05.858
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

06:05.900 --> 06:08.527
Navigation and orbit set.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.488
<i>Wait.</i>

06:11.530 --> 06:13.991
What are you doing?
I thought we were escaping.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.160
Nope, this is a diversion.

06:16.202 --> 06:18.370
I need them to chase this pod
while we go back

06:18.412 --> 06:21.165
and investigate the cause
of Tup's death.

06:21.207 --> 06:22.750
Any more questions, doctor?

06:22.791 --> 06:25.627
Actually, yes,
now that you mention it...

06:37.723 --> 06:39.600
AZI! AZI!

06:39.641 --> 06:41.185
Now what?

06:41.227 --> 06:44.563
We're going back
to figure out why Tup died.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.399
I can get us there much faster.

06:51.904 --> 06:55.116
Oh! You're just full of
surprises, aren't you?

06:55.157 --> 06:57.576
This is one of my various
survival modes.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.702
I am equipped to...

07:01.080 --> 07:02.497
Droids.

07:02.539 --> 07:04.750
A "thank you"
would have been nice.

07:16.511 --> 07:19.473
Lord Tyranus,
you summoned me?

07:19.514 --> 07:22.268
Prime Minister
Lama Su tells me

07:22.309 --> 07:24.311
there has been
a complication.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.647
What has happened
to the inhibitor chip?

07:26.688 --> 07:29.566
It was stolen by a renegade clone.

07:29.608 --> 07:32.153
<i>What does this clone know?</i>

07:32.194 --> 07:33.737
Nothing as of yet.

07:33.779 --> 07:37.491
He is just a soldier after all,
however he was a...

07:37.532 --> 07:40.619
friend to the clone
which malfunctioned.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.289
This behavior is unsettling.

07:43.330 --> 07:47.334
First the malfunctioning clone,
and now a renegade.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.753
Are you certain these soldiers
will live up

07:49.795 --> 07:51.588
to your design in the end?

07:51.630 --> 07:53.423
I am certain.

07:53.465 --> 07:57.052
The malfunction to the
inhibitor chip is an aberration.

07:57.094 --> 07:59.763
And how do you explain the renegade?

07:59.805 --> 08:02.516
I'm afraid the Jedi have
inspired creative thinking

08:02.557 --> 08:04.351
in some of the clones.

08:04.392 --> 08:08.147
That is the cause of this type
of divergent behavior.

08:08.189 --> 08:12.901
Will this interfere with protocol 66?

08:12.943 --> 08:16.446
No, I am certain of that.

08:16.488 --> 08:18.782
Find the renegade clone immediately,

08:18.824 --> 08:21.118
and make sure you recover the chip.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.453
The true nature of the inhibitor chip

08:23.495 --> 08:26.540
must not be discovered by the Jedi.

08:26.581 --> 08:30.669
Yes, Lord Tyranus.

08:46.310 --> 08:47.769
What... Oh.

08:47.811 --> 08:49.355
Once we're inside,

08:49.396 --> 08:52.066
I need you to get me
a change of clothes, AZI.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.866
Trooper,

09:00.908 --> 09:04.953
I think I saw the renegade clone
head into the storage room.

09:04.995 --> 09:07.289
All right, let's check it out.

09:09.666 --> 09:12.878
I think he was over there.

09:19.385 --> 09:21.970
We need to get
the tumor analyzed.

09:22.012 --> 09:24.639
Follow me.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.899
This is the
Genetic Records Hall.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.151
It contains data
on the original DNA

09:36.193 --> 09:39.738
of every being
we have ever cloned.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.325
We will compare the tumor's DNA
versus that of Jango Fett,

09:43.367 --> 09:45.035
the original donor.

09:45.077 --> 09:50.291
If any tumor like this has been
noted before, we will find it.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.667
The tumor, please.

09:57.505 --> 09:58.506
Nothing.

09:58.548 --> 09:59.800
What?

09:59.841 --> 10:01.176
The sample doesn't match
anything found

10:01.218 --> 10:03.011
in the Jango Fett genotype.

10:03.053 --> 10:05.806
Furthermore, it is not even
completely organic.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.849
It is foreign
to the body.

10:07.891 --> 10:10.185
Someone implanted it there.

10:10.227 --> 10:11.561
An implant?

10:11.603 --> 10:13.314
You mean this
isn't an accident?

10:13.355 --> 10:15.690
Someone did this to Tup?

10:15.732 --> 10:16.942
Precisely.

10:20.612 --> 10:22.364
<i>There have been
no unauthorized ships</i>

10:22.406 --> 10:24.658
leaving Kamino, General.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.250
I sense we are looking
in the wrong place.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.752
We have a report
from the Genetic Records Hall.

10:35.794 --> 10:37.087
Explain.

10:37.129 --> 10:39.631
Someone is accessing
the Jango Fett genotype.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.216
It's them.

10:41.258 --> 10:43.635
Evacuate that room quietly.

10:51.435 --> 10:52.727
Is there another way
out of here,

10:52.769 --> 10:54.396
besides
the door we came in?

10:54.438 --> 10:56.648
Yes, there are
emergency access hatches

10:56.690 --> 10:58.900
in every major room
in case of flooding.

10:58.942 --> 11:00.235
Good.

11:00.277 --> 11:01.778
Let's get moving.

11:04.198 --> 11:05.573
There!

11:34.144 --> 11:35.687
It's no good.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.481
They've sealed it
from the inside.

11:37.523 --> 11:39.649
Station your men
at every access point

11:39.691 --> 11:41.026
back into
the main hallway system.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.694
Yes, ma'am.

11:45.531 --> 11:47.324
Did you get
all the information you needed?

11:47.366 --> 11:48.658
Mostly.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.869
We know that the tumor
is a foreign material

11:50.911 --> 11:53.372
and was implanted
for an unknown reason.

11:53.414 --> 11:56.542
However, there is still so much
we do not know about it.

11:56.582 --> 12:00.462
For example, at what stage
was it introduced to clone Tup?

12:00.504 --> 12:02.089
And why?

12:02.130 --> 12:04.174
What is this thing?

12:04.216 --> 12:05.926
Why would someone
put it in Tup?

12:05.967 --> 12:08.136
I believe this
is an organic chip

12:08.178 --> 12:10.180
built out of cells.

12:10.222 --> 12:11.473
But what's it for?

12:11.515 --> 12:13.559
I do not know.

12:19.356 --> 12:21.358
Ah, thanks.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.319
I need to find out if what was
in Tup's head is in mine.

12:24.361 --> 12:25.904
We have already done
a scan and...

12:25.946 --> 12:27.406
But it was missed in Tup,

12:27.448 --> 12:29.241
and it could have been
missed in me too.

12:29.283 --> 12:32.035
You have to take it out.

12:32.077 --> 12:35.080
We cannot be 100% sure
if the chip is even there.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.458
I know it's there.

12:37.499 --> 12:40.668
It is a dangerous surgery.

12:42.504 --> 12:46.091
Look, you got it out of Tup.
You can get it out of me.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.261
He died after
I removed the chip.

12:49.303 --> 12:51.263
Maybe it is connected.

12:51.305 --> 12:53.723
You may die too.

12:53.765 --> 12:56.310
It's a chance
I have to take.

12:56.351 --> 12:59.104
I trust you.

13:00.397 --> 13:03.275
All right, I will do it.

13:03.317 --> 13:06.570
Let us go
to a sterile facility.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.215
Hold still.

13:27.257 --> 13:29.050
This will not hurt a bit.

13:29.092 --> 13:30.218
Ah!

13:31.803 --> 13:33.847
You do you know
what you're doing, right?

13:33.888 --> 13:35.182
Why, yes.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.058
I have been programmed
to perform over 100...

13:37.100 --> 13:38.268
All right, all right.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.145
Let's do this.

13:49.112 --> 13:51.615
You will only be unconscious
for a few minutes.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.601
There's no sign of them,
General.

14:19.643 --> 14:21.769
They must have escaped
by now.

14:21.811 --> 14:23.938
Escape was never
their intention.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.191
They're investigating,
searching.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.943
Their appearance in
the Genetics labs proves this,

14:28.985 --> 14:31.738
but what are they
searching for?

14:40.497 --> 14:41.707
Well?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.166
Was it...

14:43.208 --> 14:44.585
was it there?

14:44.626 --> 14:46.002
Yes.

14:46.044 --> 14:47.421
Identical in structure.

14:47.462 --> 14:50.048
However, it appears
that the one I found

14:50.090 --> 14:52.050
in your friend
had malfunctioned,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.052
while yours
is perfectly intact.

14:55.554 --> 15:00.100
Are you sure his breakdown
was...isolated?

15:00.141 --> 15:02.852
There is no way
of knowing that.

15:02.894 --> 15:04.854
And now that we have removed
your chip,

15:04.896 --> 15:08.191
we do not know
what will happen to you.

15:08.233 --> 15:12.153
So then I could
snap too?

15:12.195 --> 15:13.697
Possibly.

15:13.739 --> 15:16.366
But when we removed the chip
from Tup, he...

15:16.408 --> 15:19.620
I am afraid
you may die as well.

15:19.661 --> 15:22.289
I need to know if more clones
than just Tup and I have these

15:22.330 --> 15:24.999
and when we were implanted
with them.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.586
My analysis suggests
implantation took place

15:27.628 --> 15:29.170
at the earliest stage
of development,

15:29.212 --> 15:33.133
most likely when you and Tup
were only embryos.

15:33.174 --> 15:35.719
Then we have to start there.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.319
Oh, great.

15:54.112 --> 15:56.406
Try to act normal.

15:56.448 --> 15:58.032
Normal?

16:00.327 --> 16:03.163
♪ Doo-da-la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la ♪

16:03.204 --> 16:04.831
Hello!

16:05.957 --> 16:07.793
How was that?
Was that normal?

16:07.834 --> 16:11.171
For you, AZI, yeah.

16:39.616 --> 16:41.034
We will start

16:41.075 --> 16:43.662
with the earliest stage
of development.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.510
Nothing.

16:58.552 --> 17:01.471
I will now try
a stage three embryo.

17:05.349 --> 17:06.309
There it is!

17:06.351 --> 17:08.435
Ah. Try another.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.776
Based on this data,

17:14.818 --> 17:17.362
I can calculate how many
in this tree are altered.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.244
I can't believe it.

17:25.286 --> 17:26.704
They all have one.

17:32.335 --> 17:34.087
Don't move.

17:34.128 --> 17:36.214
Why are you doing this?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.466
I know what you've done.

17:38.508 --> 17:41.428
What is it
that you think I have done?

17:43.513 --> 17:45.807
How do you explain this?

17:45.849 --> 17:48.476
That is
a structural inhibitor chip,

17:48.518 --> 17:51.145
which is supposed to prevent you
from being aggressive,

17:51.187 --> 17:53.481
<i>like your source,
Jango Fett.</i>

17:53.523 --> 17:56.777
Jedi Master Syfo-Dias
instructed us

17:56.818 --> 17:59.153
to implant them
during your growth cycle.

17:59.195 --> 18:00.655
The Jedi?

18:00.697 --> 18:02.990
The Jedi had this done
to us?

18:03.032 --> 18:04.409
It is not uncommon

18:04.451 --> 18:06.494
to have inhibitors
placed in a clone.

18:06.536 --> 18:08.079
I have analyzed
this one,

18:08.121 --> 18:11.124
and apparently it has failed.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.417
Up until this point,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.001
there has never been
a problem.

18:14.043 --> 18:16.713
Well, you have got
a big problem now.

18:16.755 --> 18:18.673
Don't move!

18:23.344 --> 18:24.888
Drop your weapon.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.765
Master Jedi,
I know what's going on.

18:26.807 --> 18:28.349
I have the evidence.

18:28.391 --> 18:30.811
<i>The Jedi instructed
that inhibitor chips</i>

18:30.852 --> 18:33.814
be implanted in us at birth,
but Tup's malfunctioned.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.232
That's what made him
lose control.

18:36.274 --> 18:38.401
Where is the evidence?

18:38.443 --> 18:40.320
I have it right here.

18:40.361 --> 18:41.488
As you can see,

18:41.529 --> 18:42.989
the chip taken
from clone trooper Tup

18:43.030 --> 18:44.699
is black and rotting,

18:44.741 --> 18:46.701
indicating a malfunction
of some sort.

18:46.743 --> 18:48.703
What caused
the malfunction?

18:48.745 --> 18:50.413
It doesn't matter.

18:50.455 --> 18:52.833
The fact is,
Tup's chip malfunctioned,

18:52.874 --> 18:54.292
and it drove him insane.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.294
These chips
have to be removed,

18:56.336 --> 18:58.296
otherwise the entire
Republic Army

18:58.338 --> 18:59.798
could be compromised.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.883
There is no proof
of that.

19:01.925 --> 19:03.885
This is
an isolated incident.

19:03.927 --> 19:07.597
Besides, when you removed
trooper Tup's chip, he died.

19:07.639 --> 19:10.308
Well, that's not going
to happen to the rest of us.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.101
And how do you
know that?

19:12.143 --> 19:14.228
Because I removed mine.

19:14.270 --> 19:16.230
Here is
clone trooper Fives' chip.

19:16.272 --> 19:18.942
As you can see,
there is no sign of malfunction

19:18.984 --> 19:20.902
in either him or the chip.

19:20.944 --> 19:22.487
<i>By removing your chip,</i>

19:22.529 --> 19:24.238
you are a threat.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.325
Master Jedi, we must terminate
this trooper immediately.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.160
I am not
a piece of hardware!

19:29.202 --> 19:31.037
I'm a living being!

19:31.078 --> 19:32.873
You were created
in our laboratories.

19:32.914 --> 19:36.083
You are Kaminoan property!

19:36.125 --> 19:37.502
Correction:

19:37.544 --> 19:41.088
technically, he is property
of the Republic.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.590
That does not
change the fact

19:42.632 --> 19:45.677
that he is a danger
and must be terminated.

19:45.719 --> 19:48.179
I believe
that's for me to decide.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.265
Fives, you are coming
with me to Coruscant.

19:51.307 --> 19:54.435
I think it's time you told
your story to the Chancellor.

19:54.477 --> 19:56.354
Master Jedi,

19:56.396 --> 19:58.481
I beg you to reconsider!

19:58.523 --> 20:00.650
The Chancellor
wanted all the data on Tup

20:00.692 --> 20:02.527
to be sent to Coruscant.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.946
We're sending the data,
the tumor,

20:04.988 --> 20:06.865
and Fives along with it.

20:06.907 --> 20:09.034
Then I am going with you.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.786
As you wish, Doctor.

20:21.462 --> 20:24.215
Thank you for believing in me,
General.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.052
It is not a matter
of belief, Fives.

20:27.093 --> 20:30.055
It is simply
the right thing to do.

20:33.349 --> 20:35.435
It looks like
you got what you wanted.

20:35.476 --> 20:37.062
Thanks to you.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.313
I'll see you on the other side.

20:39.355 --> 20:41.441
The other side of what?

20:44.360 --> 20:46.237
Ah, droids.
