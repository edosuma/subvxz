07:05.726 --> 07:07.057

08:47.598 --> 08:48.899
HE'S FULL OF CRAP.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.530
I DON'T THINK SO.

08:58.268 --> 09:00.210
I'M OVER THIS.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.773
(rings and buzzes)

09:02.773 --> 09:04.975
(ring)

09:04.975 --> 09:06.677
(ring)

09:06.677 --> 09:08.619
(ring)

09:08.619 --> 09:17.187
(ring)

09:17.187 --> 09:18.959
(siren wails)

09:22.663 --> 09:23.834
CRISTINA,
I MADE A DECISION.

09:23.834 --> 09:24.795
OH, YOU HAVE?

09:24.795 --> 09:25.966
YOU'RE GOING TO STANFORD.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.267
OH, YOU'VE MADE
MY DECISION.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.699
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO COLUMBIA.

09:28.699 --> 09:29.900
AND MAYO'S IN MINNESOTA.
PLEASE.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.702
AND SINCE
WE'RE STAYING HERE,

09:31.702 --> 09:32.843
STANFORD'S ONLY
A COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.174
YOU'LL COME UP.
I'LL BRING ZOLA DOWN.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.706
WE CAN GET DRUNK
ON THE WEEKENDS.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.608
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BRING ZOLA.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.009
HEY! THERE YOU ARE.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.851
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
GO OVER ON THE CONJOINED TWINS

09:40.851 --> 09:42.052
BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT
TO BOISE?

09:42.052 --> 09:43.213
UH, NO. I'M, UH, I'M GOOD.

09:43.213 --> 09:45.285
YOU SURE?
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE

09:45.285 --> 09:47.788
THE SOLE CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON
REPRESENTING SEATTLE GRACE.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.259
WHICH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IS KIND OF UNHEARD OF

09:49.259 --> 09:51.922
FOR AN ATTENDING TO ALLOW
HER FELLOW TO DO.

09:51.922 --> 09:54.795
(whispers) BUT THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF FAITH I HAVE IN YOU.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.067
TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT A FELLOW YET.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.598
(normal voice)
I KNOW. RIGHT?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.930
I MEAN, SO JUST THINK ABOUT
ALL THE THINGS

09:59.930 --> 10:01.231
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO WHEN YOU ARE.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.674
TIP OF THE ICEBERG, YANG.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.936
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER
YOU'RE LEAVING?

10:05.936 --> 10:08.238
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET
WHERE I'M GOING.

10:08.238 --> 10:09.940
YOU JUST DID.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.682
STANFORD.
(Alex) HOPKINS!

10:11.682 --> 10:13.914
UH, HOPKINS IS NOT
IN THE RUNNING.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.146
(laughs) NOT FOR YOU.
FOR ME. HOPKINS.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.988
HOPKINS WANTS ME.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.319
HOPKINS WANTSME.

10:20.751 --> 10:23.023
JOHNS HOPKINS,
THE HOSPITAL?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.995
ALEX, HOW?
NOT HOPKINS
REFRIGERATION SCHOOL?

10:24.995 --> 10:26.827
I KINDA BITCHED OUT
THEIR CHIEF OF SURGERY

10:26.827 --> 10:27.928
AT MY BOARDS,

10:27.928 --> 10:29.800
AND I-I-I GUESS
HE WAS IMPRESSED. (laughs)

10:29.800 --> 10:31.631
SO THEY KNOW YOU'RE A JERK?
THEY TOTALLY KNOW,

10:31.631 --> 10:32.933
AND THEY WANT ME.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.905
HOPKINS WANTS ME.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.106
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.

10:36.106 --> 10:38.268
I AM 100% SURPRISED.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.812
HEY.

10:43.073 --> 10:44.815
NICE WORK, EVIL SPAWN.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.279
(chuckles)

10:49.279 --> 10:50.881
WHOO! YES!

10:50.881 --> 10:52.082
HOPKINS!

10:52.082 --> 10:54.054
THE STOMACH'S ADHERED
TO THE BOWEL,

10:54.054 --> 10:55.185
AND LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS LIVER.

10:55.185 --> 10:56.787
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE
FOR THE RECORD BOOK.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.028
WE SHOULD BE TAKING PICTURES.
OH, WE REALLY SHOULD.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.960
SURE. LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.931
WAIT FOR SOMEONE
COULD FIND A CAMERA.

11:00.931 --> 11:02.092
WE GOT ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.734
WE DO HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

11:03.734 --> 11:04.895
THIS IS MY ONLY CASE TODAY.

11:04.895 --> 11:05.996
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR DAY OFF.

11:05.996 --> 11:08.038
(scoffs) I'LL HAVE
ANOTHER DAY OFF.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.369
I MADE A LUNCH RESERVATION.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.071
I EVEN BROUGHT THE CROSSWORD.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.773
WE COULD SKIP THE CROSSWORD
FOR ONE WEEK.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.175
OHH, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.978
WHAT IN THE NAME OF CHICKENS
IS GOING ON HERE?

11:17.978 --> 11:18.949
IS IT CROHN'S DISEASE?

11:18.949 --> 11:20.711
MAYBE IT'S JUST A MYSTERY.

11:20.711 --> 11:23.053
MAYBE LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S MAGIC
BULLET'S BEEN DANCING AROUND

11:23.053 --> 11:24.815
IN MR. STEINER'S INTESTINES
FOR 50 YEARS.

11:24.815 --> 11:26.957
SOMETIMES WE JUST
NEVER FIGURE IT OUT.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.920
YOU MARVEL AT THE WONDER OF IT
ALL WHILE YOU SEW 'EM UP,

11:29.920 --> 11:31.361
AND YOU GO EAT LUNCH.

11:31.361 --> 11:33.093
IS IT
A METABOLIC SYNDROME?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.024
MNH-MNH. (gasps)

11:34.024 --> 11:36.166
OH, MAYBE IT'S AUTOIMMUNE.
(sighs)

11:38.328 --> 11:40.030
WHAT DID YOU TELL KEITH?

11:40.030 --> 11:42.803
UH, FINISH UP.
(woman) YES, SIR.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.806
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

11:49.709 --> 11:52.082
I TOLD HIM I NEEDED A DAY
OR TWO TO THINK ABOUT IT.

11:52.082 --> 11:54.084
YOU KNOW, I MADE
A COMMITMENT TO ROBBINS.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.045
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

11:55.045 --> 11:56.286
I'M FREAKING OUT.

11:56.286 --> 11:57.848
WHAT'S HOPKINS GIVING
SALARY-WISE?

11:57.848 --> 11:59.019
IT'S COMPETITIVE.

11:59.019 --> 11:59.990
THEY THROW IN
A LOAN-REPAYMENT PACKAGE

11:59.990 --> 12:02.823
UH, MOVING EXPENSES?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.124
YOU DID
THE WHOLE AFRICA THING.

12:04.124 --> 12:08.458
TELL ME YOU AT LEAST ASKED
FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ROTATION.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.830
OH, KAREV.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.001
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE ANY LEVERAGE.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.232
AND THESE ARE TWO OF THE BEST
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.733
WHO BOTH WANT YOU.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.265
AND NOW'S THE TIME
TO SHAKE 'EM DOWN.

12:15.265 --> 12:16.967
I MEAN,
PIT 'EM AGAINST EACH OTHER.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.468
YOU CALL HOPKINS BACK
AND TELL 'EM WHAT YOU WANT,

12:18.468 --> 12:19.970
AND THEN
GET HUNT'S ASS DOWN HERE

12:19.970 --> 12:21.471
AND GIVE HIM THE SAME DEMANDS.

12:21.471 --> 12:22.843
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T WANT
TO PLAY BALL?

12:22.843 --> 12:23.974
I MEAN, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE
THE MONEY,

12:23.974 --> 12:25.475
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY.
OH, HE HAS THE MONEY.

12:25.475 --> 12:26.977
AND WHEN HE LIES AND SAYS THAT
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY,

12:26.977 --> 12:28.779
AND HE WILL LIE--

12:28.779 --> 12:30.320
YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB
AS THE CHIEF IF YOU DON'T LIE--

12:30.320 --> 12:33.083
YOU TELL HIM YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIS INCIDENTALS

12:33.083 --> 12:35.255
AND OVERHEAD FUND.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.957
(elevator bell dings)

12:36.957 --> 12:38.428
INCIDENTALS
AND OVERHEAD FUND.

12:38.428 --> 12:39.790
EXACTLY.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.131
YOU SAY
THOSE FOUR LITTLE WORDS,

12:41.131 --> 12:43.193
AND I PROMISE...

12:43.193 --> 12:46.867
THE KINGDOM WILL BE YOURS.

12:48.338 --> 12:49.499
(chuckles)

12:49.499 --> 12:51.001
(elevator bell dings)

12:53.273 --> 12:56.076
HOW'S JULIA?
YOU IMPREGNATE HER YET?

12:56.076 --> 12:59.049
NO, I WAS ALL READY TO,
BUT THEN LEXIE...

12:59.049 --> 13:01.481
(exhales) OH, SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.313
OOH.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:03.313 --> 13:04.484
I SAID, "THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR."

13:04.484 --> 13:06.016
"THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR"?

13:06.016 --> 13:07.157
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:07.157 --> 13:09.359
OH, I DON'T KNOW...
KISS HER.

13:09.359 --> 13:12.492
JULIA'S AWAY ON A CONFERENCE.
I'M NOT A CHEATER.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.064
USUALLY.
MM.

13:14.064 --> 13:16.226
LOOK, I OWE IT
TO THE BOTH OF THEM TO...

13:16.226 --> 13:18.228
I DON'T WANT
TO MESS THIS ONE UP, OKAY?

13:18.228 --> 13:21.471
JULIA WANTS TO GIVE ME
EVERYTHING I WANT.

13:21.471 --> 13:24.204
BUT I'M IN LOVE WITH LEXIE, WHO
DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING I WANT.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.105
(ding)

13:25.105 --> 13:26.436
DR. SHEPHERD.

13:26.436 --> 13:28.338
DR. SLOAN.
LEXIE, COME ON IN.

13:28.338 --> 13:29.910
OH, UH...
PLENTY OF ROOM.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.311
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST GONNA UPDATE YOU

13:31.311 --> 13:33.213
ON THE BOISE DOCTORS' BIOS,
BUT SINCE YOU'RE BOTH HERE,

13:33.213 --> 13:35.185
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU,
AND THEN THAT WAY, I CAN...

13:35.185 --> 13:37.387
(doors close, ding)
LEAVE.

13:37.387 --> 13:40.450
(motor whirring)

13:43.193 --> 13:44.194
(ding)

13:44.194 --> 13:45.825
(sighs)

13:45.825 --> 13:47.827
OH, UH, NO.
OH, SORRY.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.230
YOU GUYS GO. (chuckles)
I'M GONNA STAY.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.502
OH, HEY, LEXIE,
ABOUT THAT OTHER THING,

13:52.502 --> 13:54.234
DON'T THINK I FORGOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.906
I JUST NEED TO RUMINATE
ON THAT...
AH.

13:55.906 --> 13:57.107
YOU KNOW? RUN IT UP
THE OLD FLAGPOLE?

13:57.107 --> 13:58.168
OKAY.

13:58.168 --> 13:59.839
(ding)

13:59.839 --> 14:01.841
(blows air)

14:01.841 --> 14:03.843
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD MEREDITH
AND I ARE MOVING TO BOSTON.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.876
I'M GONNA MISS THIS.

14:05.876 --> 14:07.217
HEY, YOU GOT A SECOND?

14:07.217 --> 14:08.919
'CAUSE I CANNOT FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO ABOUT TULANE,

14:08.919 --> 14:10.250
AND THERE'S
THIS WHOLE OTHER THING

14:10.250 --> 14:11.952
THAT HAPPENED AT THE BOARDS.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.084
I MEAN, IT'S ALL KINDA
THROWN ME FOR ALOOP.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.156
(people speak indistinctly)

14:16.156 --> 14:17.287
(baby cooing)

14:17.287 --> 14:21.131
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:21.131 --> 14:23.163
AW. LOOK AT THAT. SHE'S CUTE.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.265
MUST BE NICE IN HERE WITH ALL
THESE CUTE LITTLE BABIES.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.236
YEAH.

14:26.236 --> 14:29.139
IS SHE DYING,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

14:29.139 --> 14:30.470
'CAUSE NICK IS.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.943
REMEMBER NICK,
YOUR BROTHER'S BEST FRIEND,

14:32.943 --> 14:35.205
YOUR ROCK, WHO IS RIGHT NOW
PACKING UP

14:35.205 --> 14:37.447
AND BAILING ON A SURGERY
THAT HE NEEDS TO LIVE

14:37.447 --> 14:39.249
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET YOUR
STUBBORN HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS

14:39.249 --> 14:40.650
AND LET GO OF THE FACT THAT
HE DIDN'T COME TO YOU SOONER?

14:40.650 --> 14:42.012
CALLIE, I--

14:42.012 --> 14:43.153
NO, I-I DON'T GET IT.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.015
(lowered voice) YOU WATCH
BABIES DIE EVERY DAY.

14:45.015 --> 14:46.316
WHEN THINGS LOOKED BAD FOR ME,
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE MY SIDE.

14:46.316 --> 14:48.018
AND NOW YOUR BEST FRIEND'S
ASKING FOR YOU.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.120
LOOK, YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR CRAP TOGETHER

14:50.120 --> 14:52.162
BEFORE HE LEAVES,

14:52.162 --> 14:54.464
BECAUSE IF HE GOES NOW,
HE IS GONE.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.526
(baby fussing)

14:59.269 --> 15:00.370
SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY DYING,
IS SHE?

15:00.370 --> 15:01.431
NO.

15:01.431 --> 15:02.973
OKAY, GOOD.

15:02.973 --> 15:05.275
YOU SAID YOU'D KNOW MORE
ONCE YOU GOT IN THERE.

15:05.275 --> 15:06.576
WE HOPED WE'D KNOW MORE.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.109
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WEREN'T
ABLE TO FIND THE CAUSE.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.540
(Meredith) BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
WE WERE ABLE TO REPAIR

15:10.540 --> 15:12.182
ALL THE DAMAGE
TO YOUR ABDOMEN.

15:12.182 --> 15:13.984
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT IF YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S DOING IT?

15:13.984 --> 15:15.385
SOMETHING IS EATING
MY INSIDES.

15:15.385 --> 15:16.916
MAYBE IT'S STRESS,
YOU KNOW?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.218
YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO,

15:18.218 --> 15:19.549
YOU FINALLY MADE IT HAPPEN.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.322
OKAY, CORAL CAN POISON YOU.
THAT'S A KNOWN FACT.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.424
AND LOOK AT YOU. I TOLD YOU
NOT TO PET THOSE MONKEYS.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.126
WHAT? IT'S A RASH.
IT'S NOT FROM THE MONKEYS.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.457
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE A LOOK AT HER ARM?

15:27.457 --> 15:29.099
IT'S BEEN THERE FOR WEEKS.

15:29.099 --> 15:32.002
LET ME SEE. UH, WHERE DID
YOU SAY YOU HONEYMOONED AGAIN?

15:32.002 --> 15:33.233
THAILAND.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.235
YOU KNOW, WHERE PIGS WALK
AROUND INSIDE RESTAURANTS.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.307
IT'S CALLED LOCAL COLOR.
IT'S UNSANITARY.

15:37.307 --> 15:38.368
LIFE IS UNSANITARY.

15:38.368 --> 15:39.539
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN,
FOR GOD SAKES.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.071
MRS. STEINER,
PLEASE HOLD STILL.

15:41.071 --> 15:44.144
OH, WHAT IS THIS HERE?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.575
IS THAT--

15:45.575 --> 15:47.717
RIGHT THERE--
THAT'S...

15:47.717 --> 15:49.349
A WORM.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.122
GOOD NEWS.

15:52.122 --> 15:55.025
I THINK WE FOUND
WHAT'S EATING YOUR INSIDES.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.657
(coughs)

16:03.293 --> 16:04.334
MM.

16:04.334 --> 16:06.666
(typing)

16:06.666 --> 16:08.338
(computer beeps)
WHOA.

16:08.338 --> 16:10.040
THAT'S A NASTY CRITTER.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.441
RAW FISH?

16:11.441 --> 16:14.204
SUSHI IN THAILAND
FROM A TRAIN STATION.

16:14.204 --> 16:15.605
I'M LOOKING FOR MORE DAMAGE.
WANT TO HELP?

16:15.605 --> 16:18.578
NO. I'M GONNA CANCEL
OUR LUNCH RESERVATION.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.010
(types)

16:20.010 --> 16:21.081
OH, ARE YOU REALLY
STILL MOPING ABOUT LUNCH?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.412
I HAD A PLAN.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.054
WE HAD A DAY.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.016
BEN,
THERE IS A GNATHOSTOMA WORM

16:26.016 --> 16:27.617
IN THIS MAN'S BODY.

16:27.617 --> 16:29.259
THESE THINGS EAT THROUGH
THE VISCERA,

16:29.259 --> 16:31.221
MIGRATE THROUGH THE TISSUE.

16:31.221 --> 16:33.093
THIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
PARASITE.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.464
I'M SORRY IF I FIND IT

16:34.464 --> 16:35.995
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING
RIGHT NOW

16:35.995 --> 16:38.268
THAN THE CROSSWORD
AND GARDEN SALAD.

16:38.268 --> 16:39.769
THE PATIENT
IS ON ANTIPARASITICS.

16:39.769 --> 16:43.073
THE WORM IS GOING TO DIE.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.234
(beeps)
WH--

16:44.234 --> 16:45.405
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

16:45.405 --> 16:46.576
OTHER THAN GO TO LUNCH.

16:46.576 --> 16:48.007
THIS IS NOT
LIKE ONE OF YOUR MOVIES

16:48.007 --> 16:49.579
WHERE--WHERE--WHERE THE LARVAE
GESTATE IN THE BRAIN,

16:49.579 --> 16:52.082
LEAVING THE POOR HOST
A HOLLOWED-OUT ZOMBIE

16:52.082 --> 16:54.644
WHOSE BITE WILL NOW INFECT
THE WHOLE POPULOUS ON THE BASE.

16:54.644 --> 16:56.216
WHAT MOVIE IS THAT?
WHAT?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.517
NO, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.718
I MADE IT UP.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.749
OH, MAN!

16:59.749 --> 17:01.721

17:12.362 --> 17:14.064
TECHNICALLY, THAT WAS
A VERBAL AGREEMENT.

17:14.064 --> 17:15.505
I NEVER SIGNED A CONTRACT.

17:15.505 --> 17:17.036
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK

17:17.036 --> 17:18.508

AS A CONTRACT.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.670
N-N-NORMALLY, YEAH,

17:47.197 --> 17:49.399
WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUGH.
OKAY?

24:13.623 --> 24:15.485
THE WORM WENT DEEPER
INTO YOUR TISSUE

24:15.485 --> 24:17.727
BUT WE SHOULD STILL BE ABLE
TO GET THAT NASTY THING OUT.

24:17.727 --> 24:19.058
JAKE COULD DIE

24:19.058 --> 24:21.230
OR HE COULD BE IN A WHEELCHAIR
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

24:21.230 --> 24:23.633
I'M THE ONE THAT INSISTED
WE GO TO THAILAND.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.635
I KEEP TRYING TO TURN HIM
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.497
MAYBE WE MADE A MISTAKE.

24:27.497 --> 24:29.569
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY?

24:29.569 --> 24:31.701
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS A MISTAKE?

24:31.701 --> 24:33.873
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE KEEP
COMING BACK TO EACH OTHER.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.204
WE'RE THE SAME PEOPLE,

24:35.204 --> 24:37.046
BUT WE KEEP EXPECTING
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME.

24:37.046 --> 24:39.048
ISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION
OF INSANITY?

24:39.048 --> 24:40.479
OR LOVE.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.011
IF THERE'S A SPARK,
THERE'S A SPARK.

24:42.011 --> 24:43.482
OR MAYBE YOU THINK
THERE'S A SPARK,

24:43.482 --> 24:44.984
BUT IT JUST HAPPENED ONCE,
SO YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.485
AND THERE'S NO TIME
TO ACTUALLY FIGURE THAT OUT

24:46.485 --> 24:48.658
BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY MOVING
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.724
ARE WE GONNA GET THIS WORM
OUT ANY TIME SOON?

24:54.724 --> 24:57.496
YEAH.
GET THE IRRIGATION READY.
RIGHT. ON IT.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.068
C-3 AND C-4 ARE JUST A MESS.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.270
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO FURTHER
IN HERE THAN I EXPECTED.

25:01.270 --> 25:02.802
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO
ALL THE WAY TO C-5.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.133
I MEAN, FROM THE LOOK
OF THIS LESION,

25:04.133 --> 25:05.975
THAT'S WHERE THE BASTARD
SET UP HIS HIVE.

25:05.975 --> 25:07.136
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
ANY MORE INVASIVE

25:07.136 --> 25:08.608
THAN IT HAS TO BE.
DON'T ARGUE WITH HER.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.509
SHE'S STARRING IN HER OWN
SCI-FI MOVIE.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.811
YOU MESS WITH HER,
SHE'LL PULL OUT HER RAY GUN

25:11.811 --> 25:13.613
AND ATOMIZE YOUR ASS.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.184
AND HE'S STILL POUTING.
YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN.

25:15.184 --> 25:17.246
IS THIS REALLY THE FIRST TIME
YOU MISSED A LUNCH

25:17.246 --> 25:19.018
AND THE CROSSWORD
BECAUSE OF A SURGERY?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.289
HERE WE GO.

25:20.289 --> 25:21.250
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.822
WELL, THIS PARASITE'S
IMPORTANT TO ME.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.253
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:24.253 --> 25:26.826
FINE. LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.
GIVE ME THE DAMN CROSSWORD.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.197
JUST FORGET IT.

25:28.197 --> 25:29.629
OH,NO.NOBODY'SEVER
GONNA FORGET IT.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.530
WHERE IS DR. WARREN'S BAG?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.301
MIRANDA...

25:32.301 --> 25:33.763
OH, THERE IT IS.

25:33.763 --> 25:35.665
AND THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T
WORK WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

25:35.665 --> 25:36.836
I WARNED THEM.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.138
HERE WE GO. OH, THIS IS
GONNA BE SO GREAT.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.171
IT'SWAYBETTER THAN
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME,

25:42.171 --> 25:43.613
BONE-EATING PARASITE.

25:43.613 --> 25:45.544
LET'S SEE. ONE DOWN.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.716
DR. BAILEY--
OH, NO, NO, NO.

25:46.716 --> 25:47.877
NO HELP FROM YOU.
I'M TOO EXCITED.

25:47.877 --> 25:49.318
THIS IS WHAT I LIVE FOR.

25:49.318 --> 25:53.122
LET'S SEE
"PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE."

25:53.122 --> 25:55.224
OH, ANDES. FIVE, UH-HUH.

25:55.224 --> 25:56.325
UH...

25:56.325 --> 26:00.660
"PLANET WITH WATER,
FOUR LETTERS."

26:00.660 --> 26:03.332
OH, MARS. DUH.
UH, "FANCY SAUCE"?

26:03.332 --> 26:05.334
FANCY... OOH.

26:05.334 --> 26:07.737
REMOULADE.
STOP.

26:07.737 --> 26:09.599
WHAT? NO, NO.
I'M ON A ROLL. COME ON.

26:09.599 --> 26:12.301
HEY, THIS CAN'T BE THE SUNDAY,
'CAUSE THIS IS WAY TOO EASY.

26:12.301 --> 26:15.144
WHAT'S--OH, HEY, THIS ONE,
21 ACROSS.

26:15.144 --> 26:17.306
"MY QUESTION TO YOU." HMM.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.648
I'M ASKING YOU
TO PUT IT AWAY.

26:18.648 --> 26:20.209
HE'S ASKING YOU NICELY,
DR. BAILEY.

26:20.209 --> 26:22.682
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WHEN HE DOESN'T GET HIS WAY,

26:22.682 --> 26:24.614
HE HOLDS ON TO IT IN HIS CHEEK
LIKE A SQUIRREL WITH A NUT.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.155
WE ARE DOING THE CROSSWORD.

26:26.155 --> 26:28.017
WHAT IS
"MY QUESTION TO YOU"?

26:28.017 --> 26:29.719
IT'S A BUNCH OF LETTERS.

26:29.719 --> 26:31.791
UM... OH, MAYBE IT'S A PHRASE.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.592
"MY QUESTION TO YOU,"
ANYBODY?

26:33.592 --> 26:34.694
HOW MANY LETTERS?

26:34.694 --> 26:36.966
UH, 2... 9... 13.

26:36.966 --> 26:39.068
IT'S 13 LETTERS?
14.

26:39.068 --> 26:40.269
NO, I'M LOOKING AT IT.
IT'S 13.

26:40.269 --> 26:41.971
NO, IT'S 14.
COUNT AGAIN.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.332
I JUST COUNTED.

26:43.332 --> 26:44.904
WHAT, DO YOU HAVE X-RAY VISION
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.175
"WILL YOU MARRY ME"

26:46.175 --> 26:47.737
IS MY QUESTION TO YOU.

26:47.737 --> 26:50.239
AND THE REASON WHY
IT'S SO EASY

26:50.239 --> 26:51.380
IS BECAUSE I MADE
THE CROSSWORD.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.142
TOOK ME TWO DAMN MONTHS

26:53.142 --> 26:54.644
NOT TO MENTION GETTING A MOCKUP
MADE OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

26:54.644 --> 26:56.385
THE PHRASE HAS 14 LETTERS.

26:56.385 --> 26:58.718
"WILL," FOUR, "YOU," SEVEN,

26:58.718 --> 27:01.721
"MARRY," 12, "ME"...

27:01.721 --> 27:03.022
14.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.724
(clatter)

27:04.724 --> 27:05.695
(Derek) GOT IT.

27:07.657 --> 27:10.700
IT WAS IN C-4.

27:20.670 --> 27:22.842
ALL RIGHT, TEMP'S DOWN
TO 30 DEGREES.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.674
(Cristina) CROSS-CLAMPING
THE AORTA.

27:26.415 --> 27:29.318
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT.LET'S SEE
WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH.

27:31.420 --> 27:34.653
DAMN IT.
THIS WASN'T IN THE SCANS.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.756
THE TUMOR'S INFILTRATED
MUCH DEEPER INTO THE VENTRICLE.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.387
(Teddy) RECONSTRUCTIVE
VENTRICULOPLASTY

27:38.387 --> 27:40.129
ISN'T GONNA CUT IT.

27:40.129 --> 27:42.031
WE COULD DO A FONTAN?

27:42.031 --> 27:45.394
DIRECTLY SEW THE RIGHT ATRIUM
TO THE PULMONARY ARTERY.

27:45.394 --> 27:46.766
WE COULD PATCH
WHATEVER'S LEFT.

27:46.766 --> 27:47.897
THAT WOULD HELP
WITH BLOOD FLOW,

27:47.897 --> 27:49.769
BUT THE HOLE
IN THE RESECTION WOULD--

27:49.769 --> 27:52.671
YEAH. HE--HE'D ARREST
RIGHT ON THE TABLE.

27:54.744 --> 27:56.345
WE COULD DO AN R.V.
TO A P.A. CONDUIT--

27:56.345 --> 27:59.448
NO, THE THING WOULD CALCIFY.
IT WOULD KILL HIM.

27:59.448 --> 28:02.351
A CADAVER HOMOGRAFT?

28:02.351 --> 28:04.714
UH, THE HOLE WOULD BE
WAY TOO BIG.

28:04.714 --> 28:06.015
IT'S INSTANT HEART FAILURE.

28:06.015 --> 28:08.017
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,
CALLIE.

28:08.017 --> 28:09.719
THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.060
NO, IT'S--IT'S ALTMAN
AND YANG, OKAY?

28:11.060 --> 28:12.391
THEY'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.963
THEY'RE GONNA
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.765
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:15.765 --> 28:17.466
(whispers) COME ON, GUYS.
COME ON.

28:34.383 --> 28:36.986
(monitor beeping steadily)

28:36.986 --> 28:38.848
(moans)

28:38.848 --> 28:40.850
(exhales)

28:43.753 --> 28:45.855
HEY.

28:45.855 --> 28:48.027
SEDONA.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.499
HOW'S MY TICKER?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.063
CANCER FREE?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.409
THE TUMOR HAD TAKEN OVER
YOUR HEART,

29:00.409 --> 29:03.943
AND THERE WAS NO GOOD WAY
TO GET IT OUT SO...

29:03.943 --> 29:06.115
THEY HAD TO CLOSE UP.

29:06.115 --> 29:08.047
BUT I THOUGHT...

29:10.179 --> 29:13.222
YOU SAID
IT WAS MY BEST SHOT.

29:13.222 --> 29:15.124
(voice breaks) IT WAS.

29:15.124 --> 29:16.085
SO...

29:18.057 --> 29:20.289
I GUESS
I'M GOING TO BELIZE.

29:20.289 --> 29:22.231
(inhales deeply)

29:22.231 --> 29:23.762
YEAH.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.842
STUPID.

29:32.842 --> 29:35.204
(crying)

29:35.204 --> 29:38.007
I'M SO FREAKIN'...

29:39.278 --> 29:42.211
WHY DIDN'T I COME SOONER?

29:42.211 --> 29:44.353
WHY DIDN'T I COME...

29:46.355 --> 29:48.217
OH, MY GOD.

29:48.217 --> 29:50.419
I'M SO STUPID.

29:50.419 --> 29:51.861
(whimpers)

29:51.861 --> 29:54.123
I'M SO STUPID.

29:54.123 --> 29:55.995
(sniffles)
I'M SO STUPID.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.467
(crying) NO. NO.

29:58.467 --> 30:00.900
(continues crying)

30:00.900 --> 30:03.232
I'M SO STUPID.

30:03.232 --> 30:04.473
I'M SO STUPID.

30:04.473 --> 30:08.477
(continues crying)

30:14.183 --> 30:17.186
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

30:22.992 --> 30:24.393
HEY.
HEY.

30:24.393 --> 30:27.997
I-I THINK
WE'RE GONNA LOSE YANG.

30:30.399 --> 30:32.932
OWEN, WHAT HAPPENED?
PLEASE TELL ME.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.964
'CAUSE I-I HAVE
TRIED EVERYTHING

30:34.964 --> 30:37.236
SHORT OF OFFERING HER
MY OWN JOB.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.968
I MEAN, I'VE SANG,
I'VE--I'VE DANCED, I'VE--

30:38.968 --> 30:41.170
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.177
(sighs)

30:48.177 --> 30:49.418
SO... (sighs)

30:49.418 --> 30:52.581
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU COULD'VE DONE.

30:55.124 --> 30:58.257
(sighs)
SHE'S NOT LEAVING YOU.

31:00.589 --> 31:03.933
SHE'S LEAVING ME.

31:06.635 --> 31:08.898
I'M SORRY.

31:14.143 --> 31:17.146
(people speaking indistinctly)

31:17.146 --> 31:20.409
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

31:24.013 --> 31:25.654
HOPKINS DIDN'T PULL
THE OFFER, DID THEY?

31:25.654 --> 31:29.218
THEY, UH, GAVE ME
THE INTERNATIONAL ROTATION

31:29.218 --> 31:30.559
AND THE MOVING EXPENSES,

31:30.559 --> 31:33.192
AND THEY TOOK CARE OF, UH,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.564
ALL MY LOANS--
COLLEGE, MED SCHOOL.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.096
(laughs) YES.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.567
THEY'RE EVEN THROWING IN
A MORTGAGE ALLOWANCE.

31:38.567 --> 31:39.929
(laughs)

31:39.929 --> 31:41.200
I COULD BUY A HOUSE.
(laughs)

31:41.200 --> 31:42.331
(laughs) GOOD.

31:42.331 --> 31:45.304
(sighs) THEY GAVE ME
EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR.

31:46.675 --> 31:48.938
SO DID HUNT.

31:48.938 --> 31:53.442
THEN... WHY THE HELL
AREN'T YOU CELEBRATING?

31:59.518 --> 32:02.191
NO ONE'S EVER WANTED ME
LIKE THIS.

32:02.191 --> 32:05.324
(chuckles)

32:05.324 --> 32:09.458
YOU JUST DON'T RECOGNIZE
THE VIEW, KAREV...
