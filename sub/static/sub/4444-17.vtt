00:00.309 --> 00:01.777
<i>Previously on The Fosters:</i>

00:01.805 --> 00:03.528
Kidnapping is a very serious crime.

00:03.533 --> 00:04.879
They can't prove that you bought that toy,

00:04.900 --> 00:06.034
or you gave it to Daphne.

00:06.057 --> 00:07.951
You said yourself that Ana has no business

00:07.959 --> 00:10.370
taking care of a baby when
she can't take care of herself.

00:10.432 --> 00:12.736
Flintwood has one of the best
athletic programs in the country.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.366
- My moms couldn't afford it.
- I'm offering you a scholarship.

00:15.424 --> 00:18.282
I don't care that you forgot
some words to a stupid song.

00:18.294 --> 00:20.444
I care that you took some
freaking mystery pills,

00:20.503 --> 00:21.981
and didn't think about
what would happen next.

00:21.996 --> 00:24.633
Idyllwild would like
to offer you a full ride

00:24.656 --> 00:25.978
to their summer music program.

00:26.002 --> 00:27.927
- She's a criminal!
- She's my baby!

00:27.937 --> 00:29.334
- Mommy!
- Daphne Keen?

00:29.350 --> 00:31.181
- Yeah?
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.

00:31.193 --> 00:32.286
There's something I have to tell you.

00:32.301 --> 00:33.718
I think I should go live with Robert.

00:38.673 --> 00:42.053
I mean, I'm just trying to
understand here. Did he...

00:42.391 --> 00:43.321
did he threaten you?

00:43.345 --> 00:46.474
Or say something to make you think that
this is the only choice that you had?

00:46.510 --> 00:50.710
Just... you just seemed pretty upset
after your last visitation with him.

00:50.715 --> 00:51.799
No, no.

00:54.441 --> 00:55.709
Well...

00:56.335 --> 00:58.319
what happened to make you change your mind?

00:58.646 --> 01:01.046
We all know that the judge is
gonna rule in Robert's favor.

01:01.064 --> 01:02.352
It's just a matter of time.

01:02.364 --> 01:05.529
And I can't keep asking you
to pay all these legal fees.

01:05.572 --> 01:06.866
This is about money?

01:07.541 --> 01:10.366
Sweetheart, we can figure out the money.

01:10.385 --> 01:12.122
I'm just tired of fighting
when there's no point.

01:17.332 --> 01:18.604
OK.

01:19.259 --> 01:21.381
Why don't you, uh, go grab some breakfast?

01:21.386 --> 01:22.713
It's almost time for school.

01:24.132 --> 01:26.699
Hey, love, listen. Uh...

01:26.966 --> 01:29.490
Can you not say anything to Robert
about your decision just yet?

01:29.971 --> 01:32.537
Maybe we can leave this
between us for a few days?

01:33.893 --> 01:34.875
OK, sure.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.806
I tell you, as soon as
Robert gets wind of this,

01:43.826 --> 01:45.760
he will have us in court
so fast your head'll spin.

01:45.778 --> 01:46.601
And, you know, she's right.

01:46.669 --> 01:49.080
That judge is just dying
to give him custody.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.068
[sighs]

01:51.797 --> 01:53.302
I just want to know what she's thinking.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.330
I don't get it. I don't get
it. I don't get it at all.

01:56.055 --> 01:59.224
I know. But is it really
so hard to believe that,

01:59.560 --> 02:01.504
after everything she's been
through, that she's just...

02:01.557 --> 02:03.517
... she's just tired of living in limbo?

02:04.170 --> 02:07.135
That she just wants to make a
choice before one is made for her?

02:07.187 --> 02:09.326
No, I don't buy it. I think there's
something else going on here.

02:09.327 --> 02:10.086
I guarantee it.

02:10.543 --> 02:12.665
Because even if Callie was tired

02:12.731 --> 02:14.990
of fighting for herself, she
would never stop fighting for Jude.

02:20.907 --> 02:23.745
I know it's not what we wanted.

02:23.865 --> 02:26.499
We wanted to be by the same family,

02:26.619 --> 02:29.014
living in the same house.

02:29.688 --> 02:31.636
But, Jude, knowing that you're safe

02:31.674 --> 02:35.642
and adopted by a family
that truly loves you...

02:36.403 --> 02:38.039
That's all I've ever wanted.

02:40.574 --> 02:41.904
Hey, I'm gonna be safe, too.

02:42.779 --> 02:44.587
I'm gonna be living with Robert, but

02:45.092 --> 02:47.309
I'm always gonna be a part of the Fosters.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.349
It's just like Stef and Lena always say,

02:49.359 --> 02:51.498
we don't need a piece
of paper to be a family.

02:53.044 --> 02:54.672
I'm still gonna go to Anchor Beach,

02:54.891 --> 02:56.202
and I'll be around all the time.

02:56.251 --> 02:57.096
I'll spend the night sometimes.

02:57.097 --> 02:58.978
And you can spend the night with
the Quinns whenever you want.

02:59.931 --> 03:02.084
And they have a pool. You love to swim.

03:05.648 --> 03:07.813
Maybe if you learned how to drive,

03:08.230 --> 03:11.040
he'd buy you a car and then
you could pick me up for school.

03:11.102 --> 03:13.228
So we could still see
each other every morning.

03:14.109 --> 03:15.768
Yeah. For sure.

03:16.175 --> 03:18.186
I'll make it, like, a condition.

03:19.237 --> 03:20.482
Hey.

03:22.518 --> 03:24.195
I know we didn't

03:24.432 --> 03:27.014
get our happy ending just how we wanted it,

03:28.473 --> 03:30.363
but we're still getting it, right?

03:34.074 --> 03:36.250

Listen, we have, um...

04:26.006 --> 04:28.074
we've done a little bit of
research on the Flintwood Academy.

04:28.089 --> 04:30.132
And we can't deny that it's a great school.

04:30.155 --> 04:31.415
So I can go?

04:31.841 --> 04:35.615
Well... we just don't think that
you're ready to be on your own.

04:35.645 --> 04:36.405
You're only 15.

04:36.424 --> 04:38.466
I'm not gonna be on my
own. It's a boarding school.

04:38.748 --> 04:40.167
You're letting Brandon go on tour.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.714
There are gonna be no adults there at all!

04:41.717 --> 04:44.464
That's true, that's just
for a few weeks, though.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.551
Honey, if this were just a camp,
or something over the summer...

04:47.575 --> 04:50.244
Well, can you meet with the
scout and at least hear him out?

04:50.364 --> 04:52.178
Honey, we would just be wasting his time.

04:52.436 --> 04:55.192
- I can't believe this.
- Honey, you can wrestle here.

04:55.312 --> 04:57.558
We can still get scouts to
come by Anchor Beach, you know.

04:57.559 --> 04:58.492
Not anymore.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.520
You've gutted the entire
athletic department.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.512
- Anchor Beach is a joke.
- Hey.

05:03.022 --> 05:04.043
I'm going to school.

05:06.459 --> 05:08.914
He didn't mean that, love.
He loves Anchor Beach.

05:08.992 --> 05:10.892
No, no, he's got a point.

05:11.012 --> 05:14.212
That's why all this whole
financial mess is so frustrating.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.068
We've had to cut so much
just to keep the doors open.

05:16.112 --> 05:17.546
What about Timothy? Is he still...

05:17.583 --> 05:19.597
Convinced that Monte is the enemy? Yes.

05:19.621 --> 05:22.251
Which leaves me in the delightful
position of trying to support my boss

05:22.266 --> 05:24.338
and trying to protect my
friend's job at the same time.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.357
I'm sorry, love.

05:25.387 --> 05:27.287
But if there's anyone that
can broker a peace deal,

05:27.321 --> 05:28.561
it would be you.

05:31.317 --> 05:33.933
Dance team auditions
today after school. Flier?

05:38.937 --> 05:41.064
Here. Take a flier.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.080
Hey. What about me?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.836
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:46.956 --> 05:49.488
Tia and I decided that it's
best to get a fresh start.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.877
We don't want anyone from the old team.

05:50.908 --> 05:53.133
You know, conflict of
interest and all that.

05:53.171 --> 05:55.943
Um, you guys are from the old team.

05:55.959 --> 05:58.595
Yeah, but we left. You got cut.

05:58.648 --> 06:00.714
You're not gonna find a better
dancer in school than me.

06:01.086 --> 06:04.360
I don't know. I mean, if it was
up to me, I would totally say yes.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.656
But Tia is, like, crazy hard to impress.

06:07.776 --> 06:08.711
OK.

06:09.539 --> 06:11.278
What if I just come and dance?

06:11.703 --> 06:13.708
I bet I could blow her mind.

06:14.164 --> 06:16.283
Well, I can't stop you from showing up,

06:16.313 --> 06:18.637
but I can't guarantee anything.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.820
Great. See you this afternoon.

06:22.222 --> 06:25.959
- Oh, my God, April is killer. Is she in?
- I don't know.

06:26.004 --> 06:27.394
I told her she had to audition.

06:27.514 --> 06:29.057
You did? Why?

06:29.095 --> 06:31.161
Well, April only responds to mean girls.

06:31.281 --> 06:34.116
The meaner you are to her, the
more she'll work for your approval.

06:34.236 --> 06:36.713
What do you mean, my approval? Why me?

06:36.833 --> 06:38.763
Well, April already knows I'm nice,

06:38.793 --> 06:40.251
so you have to be the mean girl.

06:40.371 --> 06:42.689
But it's not like you have to
do anything, just be yourself.

06:42.712 --> 06:45.750
Wow, thanks.

06:50.232 --> 06:52.001
Seat taken?

06:56.437 --> 06:58.130
[sighs]

06:58.799 --> 07:00.325
You're quiet today.

07:01.039 --> 07:03.279
You barely said anything during breakfast.

07:04.806 --> 07:07.183
- How are you?
- I'm cool.

07:07.198 --> 07:08.648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.266
How is everything?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.955
With the band, you said
you guys are burnt out?

07:12.978 --> 07:16.814
Oh, no, I just... need a
little break. Nothing major.

07:16.867 --> 07:21.105
Hey, I never, uh, never asked
you how Daphne's visit with Tasha.

07:21.371 --> 07:23.999
- Why?
- Just wondering.

07:24.119 --> 07:25.624
It was OK.

07:25.677 --> 07:28.351
Did Tasha remember her, from Christmas?

07:29.277 --> 07:31.951
- Nope.
- That's good.

07:32.756 --> 07:36.378
- Lucky she didn't get caught.
- We're all lucky, Brandon.

07:37.547 --> 07:39.560
- You haven't told anyone, have you?
- No.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.909
Good. Don't.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.949
A lot of bad stuff could
happen if people find out.

07:45.308 --> 07:47.930
- OK.
- [school bell rings]

07:48.564 --> 07:50.411
I should get to class.

<i>- Hey, Dad.
- [Mike] Hey, B.</i>

08:00.563 --> 08:02.358
I was just wondering if
you're free for dinner tonight.

08:02.478 --> 08:05.006
I can't, actually. I've got family dinner.

08:05.025 --> 08:08.173
What about after? We could shoot
some pool, maybe watch the game?

08:08.293 --> 08:11.697
- I have band practice after.
- All right.

08:12.061 --> 08:14.293
Well, maybe some time this week, huh?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.588
Yeah, sure. Maybe.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.383
<i>- All right, have a good one.
- You too, Dad.</i>

08:26.914 --> 08:30.000
Well, uh, you got what you wanted.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.508
Excuse me?

08:31.509 --> 08:33.133
Ana got a job, she's moving out.

08:33.152 --> 08:34.928
That's not what I wanted, Mike.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.405
I just want you to take care of yourself.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.376
Yeah? Well, I just she
can take care of herself.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.059
She's pregnant, alone,
and now she's gonna be up

08:43.075 --> 08:44.829
on her feet all night stocking groceries.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.888
And what about after she has the baby? Huh?

08:47.008 --> 08:48.785
A newly sober single mom,

08:48.786 --> 08:50.706
raising a baby alone on minimum wage?

08:50.721 --> 08:52.820
Is it really so wrong that
I want to help her out?

08:53.267 --> 08:56.052
I think I can help myself
and someone in need, Stef.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.965
Uh, I, um...

09:01.017 --> 09:04.571
I don't think she's gonna
need your help. Mike, she's...

09:05.513 --> 09:07.373
She's not planning on raising this baby.

09:07.891 --> 09:09.973
Whatever you might think
about Ana and who she...

09:09.992 --> 09:10.854
She...

09:11.650 --> 09:14.551
she stopped by the other day.

09:15.199 --> 09:17.544
What do you mean,
stopped by? To your house?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.312
For what?

09:22.261 --> 09:24.540
She asked us to adopt her baby.

09:29.967 --> 09:32.684
So the people of the village
silently accept the murder

09:32.699 --> 09:35.230
of a randomly selected
member of their society.

09:35.721 --> 09:36.504
Why?

09:38.707 --> 09:39.348
Tia.

09:39.468 --> 09:41.948
Because it's a tradition that
they think binds their community.

09:41.963 --> 09:42.591
That's right.

09:42.604 --> 09:44.174
<i>Tradition in The Lottery,</i>

09:44.294 --> 09:45.676
<i>oppression in The Hunger Games.</i>

09:45.701 --> 09:49.249
So whose silence do you think
is more egregious, theirs...

09:51.120 --> 09:52.885
... or the citizens of Panem?

09:54.498 --> 09:55.441
Mariana.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.382
Well, it's easy to say
the townspeople, but, like,

09:58.455 --> 10:01.104
everything you've been taught is
true from the day you were born, like,

10:01.459 --> 10:03.374
I don't know, racism
or something like that,

10:03.423 --> 10:06.752
can be every bit as oppressive
as some outside force. Right?

10:07.010 --> 10:08.405
That's great, Mariana.

10:08.633 --> 10:12.183
Now, it has been said that "A man
is known by the silence he keeps."

10:12.192 --> 10:13.121
[school bell rings]

10:13.169 --> 10:14.525
Your assignment this week

10:14.544 --> 10:17.495
is to write about a silence
that you keep in your life.

10:18.016 --> 10:19.693
Have a great day, everyone.

10:25.768 --> 10:27.679
The principal and vice principal.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.680
This must be important.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.282
I thought we agreed, no poaching dancers.

10:43.880 --> 10:48.247
- April?
- Umm, April isn't your dancer.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.001
You threw her off the team because
she was drunk at my party, remember?

10:51.121 --> 10:54.077
Though she was stone cold sober
compared to you that night.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.482
Whatever.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.977
April's never gonna join
your loser team anyway.

10:57.989 --> 11:00.580
[laughs] Yeah, especially when
she hears about your super lame

11:00.624 --> 11:03.846

Robot theme. [Laughs]

11:06.019 --> 11:06.908
Well,

11:07.418 --> 11:08.629
we'll see about that.

11:08.749 --> 11:11.215
Now, excuse me, you're blocking my locker.

11:14.378 --> 11:17.280
There are plenty of grants available
that aren't based on test scores.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.861
Yes, there are, but not many, and
they're typically much smaller.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.747
Fine, but unlike the
ones you're in favor of,

11:21.761 --> 11:25.309
they're not funded by private corporations
that are trying to dictate education reform.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.314
- You think I'm in support...
- Educators are the ones that should...

11:27.317 --> 11:29.034
Standardized testing is a tool,

11:29.073 --> 11:31.673
one tool, used to measure
a school's success.

11:31.688 --> 11:33.967
By teaching students to
memorize, not to think!

11:33.987 --> 11:36.529
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. We are not asking you

11:36.534 --> 11:37.963
to teach students to memorize.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.636
We are asking you to think
about the bigger picture!

11:40.756 --> 11:43.975
Anchor Beach is facing
a real financial crisis,

11:44.019 --> 11:46.206
one that could actually close the doors.

11:46.231 --> 11:48.933
- And this is not just about...
- I'm not doing this just to be difficult!

11:48.958 --> 11:52.525
This is not just about your
English classes, Timothy.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.242
It's about art, music, sports.

11:55.362 --> 11:57.775
And I don't want to have
to cut those programs.

11:57.794 --> 12:01.279
But if you're too dogmatic to
see beyond your own classroom,

12:01.751 --> 12:03.632
you're welcome to resign.

12:15.507 --> 12:16.445
OK.

12:17.491 --> 12:19.309
How can I be more...

12:19.702 --> 12:20.757
cooperative?

12:21.107 --> 12:23.416
Well, you could start by teaching...

12:24.184 --> 12:25.710
more critical thinking.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.489
More non-fiction.

12:33.036 --> 12:34.586
I'll get right on it.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.260

- Hey.

12:39.361 --> 12:40.782
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:40.789 --> 12:42.138
We need to talk.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.308
Not here.

12:52.913 --> 12:56.036
- OK...
- The cops came over to my place the other day.

12:56.156 --> 12:57.603
Why didn't you call me?

12:57.723 --> 12:58.843
I don't know, I guess I was afraid

12:58.867 --> 13:00.331
that they were tapping
our phones or somethin'.

13:00.345 --> 13:01.167
What did they want?

13:01.186 --> 13:02.791
They wanted to know where
I was on Christmas Eve.

13:02.911 --> 13:06.081
- And?
- So I told 'em that I got off work,

13:06.115 --> 13:07.451
- I went home right after work
- Yeah.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.041
and I was by myself all day.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.382
They asked if I could prove it.

13:10.426 --> 13:11.888
The cops don't have anything.

13:11.908 --> 13:13.832
Why do you think they're
trying to get us to talk?

13:14.231 --> 13:16.691
They said I can go to jail
for 11 years for kidnapping.

13:16.705 --> 13:18.611
Eleven years just 'cause
I wanted to hold my baby.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.108
Robert's lawyers aren't
gonna let that happen.

13:20.117 --> 13:21.441
Robert's lawyers aren't looking out for me,

13:21.476 --> 13:22.436
they're looking out for you.

13:22.437 --> 13:23.763
They don't care about the brown girl.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.625
They'll throw me under the bus first
chance they get just to save your ass.

13:26.652 --> 13:29.016
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- You don't have control!

13:29.051 --> 13:30.887
No, I don't, but Robert does.

13:31.066 --> 13:32.629
And he's gonna do what I say.

13:32.749 --> 13:34.795
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna live with him.

13:36.498 --> 13:37.497
Why?

13:37.676 --> 13:39.224
It's for the best. I can't even

13:39.294 --> 13:41.204
look Stef and Lena in the face right now.

13:41.235 --> 13:43.024
I swore that I would
never lie to them again.

13:43.191 --> 13:45.902
- So why don't you just tell them?
- You wanna go to jail?

13:46.061 --> 13:47.927
OK? 'Cause that's what would
happen. I would be taking you

13:47.951 --> 13:49.405
and Brandon down with me.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.205
- What about Jude?
- I lied.

13:52.675 --> 13:54.514
I told him that I had
to be out of the system.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.181
And he's been in the system,
so he understands. He'll be OK.

13:57.947 --> 14:00.082
- I should have never called you that night.
- Yeah,

14:00.747 --> 14:01.680
but you did.

14:11.425 --> 14:12.798
[knock on door]

14:20.679 --> 14:22.749
Is Robert here?

14:29.280 --> 14:30.780
So, uh,

14:30.900 --> 14:32.688
how'd you get all the way over here?

14:32.808 --> 14:34.458
I took the bus.

14:35.157 --> 14:37.320
A couple, actually.

14:38.839 --> 14:40.121
Wow.

14:44.006 --> 14:46.434
Callie told me she's
coming to live with you.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.458
She's only doing it because

14:50.465 --> 14:52.242
she's scared of getting
yanked out of the house again.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.500
Oh... Jude...

14:56.530 --> 14:59.120
We've been moved from house
to house for six years,

14:59.193 --> 15:02.639
and we never had any say
in where we're going to live

15:02.759 --> 15:04.880
or when we're going to
be sent to another house.

15:06.193 --> 15:08.259
It felt like nobody wanted us.

15:12.073 --> 15:15.028
But then Stef and Lena,
they... they took us in.

15:15.073 --> 15:17.701
And I'm so glad they did.

15:17.929 --> 15:21.476
They care so much about you and Callie.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.333
We finally found a home.

15:26.053 --> 15:28.253
And Callie still doesn't feel safe.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.273
[sighs]

15:31.393 --> 15:34.943
Robert and I want the same
thing for Callie as you do, Jude.

15:35.732 --> 15:38.397
But... maybe...

15:38.432 --> 15:40.662
Maybe, in some ways,

15:41.011 --> 15:43.624
Callie will be safer here.

15:44.065 --> 15:45.751
How?

15:48.925 --> 15:51.629
We would never take Callie away from you.

15:52.329 --> 15:55.625
And if Callie does come to live with us,

15:56.050 --> 15:59.285
I hope you'll consider yourself
a part of this family, too.

16:05.159 --> 16:07.821
Hey, I thought you were
having dinner with Brandon.

16:07.941 --> 16:09.972
Apparently, he's busy.

16:12.630 --> 16:16.048
So you asked Stef and
Lena to adopt the baby?

16:16.247 --> 16:19.115
I'm sorry, I was gonna tell you, I just...

16:19.134 --> 16:21.583
I wanted to know what was
going on before I said anything.

16:21.912 --> 16:24.496
You didn't think it was important
to talk to me about it first?

16:25.495 --> 16:27.650
Look, I know you're scared. I get it.

16:27.668 --> 16:31.523
- But we can do this, Ana.
- We?

16:32.330 --> 16:34.456
Mike, there is no "we."

16:34.494 --> 16:36.886
You are living in some
kind of fantasy world!

16:36.898 --> 16:38.757
This is why I need to move out!

16:39.784 --> 16:42.949
You think that if I move in here,
and you help me raise this baby,

16:42.955 --> 16:46.698
that we're gonna live happily ever
after and never do drugs or drink again.

16:46.818 --> 16:49.815
Raising a baby makes it
harder to stay sober, Mike,

16:49.827 --> 16:50.872
not easier.

16:50.933 --> 16:53.942
I know that, I've been
there! And so have you!

16:54.002 --> 16:56.208
You'd think that you'd know better!

16:56.328 --> 16:58.347

Actually, he's, uh, mad at you.

23:23.537 --> 23:25.816
So, there it is.

23:26.347 --> 23:28.920
You bought this with the
money from the fundraiser?

23:29.040 --> 23:30.931
Well, yeah, that and Robert, you know.

23:30.939 --> 23:34.166
He did help us. He came in
with a little extra scratch

23:34.167 --> 23:37.455
so that we could definitely
get someplace nice like this.

23:37.575 --> 23:39.361
And now, since we own it,

23:39.419 --> 23:42.206
we don't ever have to worry
about a landlord coming in

23:42.219 --> 23:44.285
and pulling the rug out
from underneath us. You know?

23:44.405 --> 23:45.585
Literally.

23:46.126 --> 23:48.034
He really is a good man.

23:51.985 --> 23:53.950
What?

23:54.684 --> 23:57.092
I'm gonna go live with him.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.263
Well, you don't sound
very happy about that.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.846
No, it's just, um...

24:04.811 --> 24:07.820
I know I'm hurting Lena and Stef.

24:08.286 --> 24:10.194
And I hate that.

24:10.314 --> 24:12.449
Oh, honey.

24:12.781 --> 24:16.674
You know, sometimes you
gotta do what you gotta do.

24:24.155 --> 24:26.396
Hey. Can you buy Callie a car?

24:26.614 --> 24:28.266
Whenever she moves in with you.

24:28.276 --> 24:30.041
I just want her to be able to come home...

24:30.079 --> 24:35.102
I mean, to my house, the
Fosters, whenever she wants.

24:35.222 --> 24:38.273
That sounds pretty reasonable. [Laughs]

24:38.393 --> 24:40.583
You'll have to teach her how to
drive, though. She doesn't know how.

24:40.589 --> 24:42.028
- Really?
- She can barely ride a bike.

24:42.046 --> 24:44.725
[laughs] I see that. Hey!

24:45.047 --> 24:47.156
So? What do you think?

24:48.445 --> 24:50.420
It's amazing. [Laughs]

24:53.992 --> 24:54.916
Hey.

24:55.809 --> 24:58.130
So, um, I understand

24:58.250 --> 25:00.682
you feel we're not listening to you.

25:00.992 --> 25:03.854
And, uh, you know, you're
probably right. Sometimes...

25:04.604 --> 25:06.133
sometimes we feel like

25:06.145 --> 25:08.010
we know what you want better than you do.

25:08.130 --> 25:11.523
That used to be the case
when you were younger.

25:11.748 --> 25:13.783
But probably not so much anymore.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.679
So I will talk to Mama.

25:15.728 --> 25:17.781
We'll have the scout
over, and hear him out.

25:17.901 --> 25:20.771
- Really?
- Yes. But that is all we're agreeing to,

25:20.795 --> 25:23.074
- so don't go packing your bags yet or anything.
- Mom!

25:23.110 --> 25:25.808
Hey! I never thought
I'd say this to my kid,

25:25.869 --> 25:28.384
but I will pass on the hug
till you've showered, please.

25:28.414 --> 25:31.112
Mom, can we please get a
punching bag in the garage?

25:31.232 --> 25:33.579
What do you need a punching bag for
when you have your brother, Brandon?

25:33.609 --> 25:35.250
I'm kidding. You mess with your him again,

25:35.268 --> 25:37.249
you'll have to answer
to these guys right here.

25:37.419 --> 25:39.909
- Wait, I don't see anything there.
- These punching bags.

25:39.952 --> 25:42.649
You're gonna see stars if
you don't get out of here.

25:47.148 --> 25:50.214
So, uh, I told Jesus that we would sit down

25:50.243 --> 25:52.436
with the recruiter from
Flintwood. Do you hate me?

25:54.591 --> 25:58.032
- What?
- Robert just dropped off Callie and Jude.

26:05.459 --> 26:06.378
Hey.

26:06.781 --> 26:08.862
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.773
[Mike] Thanks for the
tea. Sorry for barging in.

26:15.986 --> 26:19.480
I don't know how to say
this, uh, exactly, but...

26:20.368 --> 26:24.120
... are... are you guys
gonna take Ana's baby?

26:26.520 --> 26:29.421
Um... no.

26:29.877 --> 26:31.859
I don't think so.

26:32.953 --> 26:34.251
OK.

26:36.871 --> 26:38.983
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

26:39.955 --> 26:42.469
but... I think I'm gonna ask her if I can.

26:42.758 --> 26:45.469
- Adopt her baby?
- Why not? I'm capable.

26:45.523 --> 26:48.409
Of course... of course
you are, Mike, I just...

26:48.968 --> 26:52.055
A baby? Now? By yourself?

26:52.088 --> 26:53.847
Otherwise, what?

26:54.056 --> 26:56.536
Let her give it up to some
strangers or who knows who?

26:56.566 --> 26:58.541
No, I hear you, I hear you. But

26:58.822 --> 27:00.933
do you really wanna spend the next 18 years

27:00.963 --> 27:02.862
of your life raising another child?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.507
I don't exactly feel like I got a chance

27:05.521 --> 27:06.669
to raise the first one.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.536
It's not over, Mike. He's still here.

27:13.216 --> 27:16.157
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

27:17.046 --> 27:18.460
Thought you had band practice.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.658
Didn't you say you were
taking a few days off?

27:20.911 --> 27:23.234
- No, yeah. Uh...
- Got it.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.070
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.485
You know what?

27:31.734 --> 27:33.367
I'm trying, B.

27:34.179 --> 27:36.181
I'm really trying every way I know how.

27:36.220 --> 27:37.847
You never wanna spend any time together.

27:37.967 --> 27:38.834
Is this about Ana?

27:38.858 --> 27:41.075
'Cause you don't have to worry
about that anymore. She's moving out.

27:41.153 --> 27:43.598
- Of course she is.
- What is that supposed to mean?

27:43.661 --> 27:45.844
That's why you're here, right?

27:46.252 --> 27:47.443
'Cause there's no one else.

27:47.949 --> 27:48.757
Brandon,

27:48.877 --> 27:51.162
- I know that's not how your dad feels.
- It's OK.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.409
Go on.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.091
Say what's on your mind.

27:57.228 --> 27:58.336
Whenever you're not...

27:59.332 --> 28:01.228
... seeing someone...

28:01.238 --> 28:03.425
No, actually, whenever
you're not saving someone,

28:03.545 --> 28:05.647
you dump everything on me.

28:05.676 --> 28:08.451
All your feelings, your
loneliness, everything.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.566
And it makes me feel suffocated.

28:10.614 --> 28:12.948
So I don't wanna see you, Dad.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.333
I'm gonna let you guys...

28:35.937 --> 28:38.662
You know, Brandon, there's
a saying in the program.

28:39.706 --> 28:42.526
"You've got a God-shaped hole,
and you keep trying to fill it

28:42.535 --> 28:44.766
with anything but God."

28:46.389 --> 28:48.530
I'll work on it, OK?

28:53.225 --> 28:55.520
But you gotta do better, too, Brandon.

28:55.556 --> 28:58.618
You're at an age now where this
relationship is a two-way street.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.219
I can't force you to see me, but if

29:01.256 --> 29:02.994
you want me to know
what's going on with you,

29:02.994 --> 29:04.613
you're gonna have to tell me.

29:08.904 --> 29:10.689
The ball's in your court.

29:11.372 --> 29:13.005
Whenever you're ready.

29:14.344 --> 29:16.471
I got a scholarship.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.155
To Idyllwild.

29:20.572 --> 29:23.620
For their summer program.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.458
What about the tour?

29:34.261 --> 29:36.055
Hm...

29:38.372 --> 29:41.666
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know. I...

29:41.685 --> 29:44.843
I don't want to be pressured into anything,

29:45.368 --> 29:48.254
so I haven't told moms, but...

29:48.923 --> 29:52.750
- If they knew...
- You think they'd take the tour off the table?

29:53.229 --> 29:54.892
That's not true, B.

29:54.930 --> 29:57.877
The whole reason we're even
letting you go on this tour

29:57.900 --> 30:01.782
is 'cause we think you're mature
enough to make your own choices.

30:02.921 --> 30:06.065
This is just another choice, B.

30:07.781 --> 30:11.237
I don't know if I can get
invested into classical music again

30:11.243 --> 30:13.961
and not be able to play the way I want.

30:14.359 --> 30:15.483
Please,

30:15.988 --> 30:18.881
don't give up on this 'cause you're
afraid of disappointment, Brandon.

30:19.736 --> 30:22.768
Sometimes it takes a lot of
failure to reach success, trust me.

30:23.448 --> 30:26.373
One thing being your dad
has taught me, it's that.

30:34.846 --> 30:36.657
Is that the article I just printed out?

30:37.575 --> 30:40.430
"Charter Schools and the Corporate
Takeover of Public Education:

30:40.454 --> 30:41.924
"What's at Stake?" What is this?

30:42.234 --> 30:45.522
I don't know. Timothy emailed it
to us, said to read it tonight.

30:45.642 --> 30:48.401
Something about us having
to read more non-fiction.

30:48.924 --> 30:51.768
Ugh. Now I have to study about
how I'm getting an education?

30:51.792 --> 30:53.536
Who cares about education?

30:54.709 --> 30:56.963
I mean, no offense.

31:09.012 --> 31:10.914
Well, it's great, it's really great.

31:11.807 --> 31:16.090
- And Robert helped you?
- Yes. Yes.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.811
Uh, is something the matter?

31:20.817 --> 31:23.552
Uh... [laughs]

31:23.795 --> 31:26.104
Yeah. Uh...

31:26.943 --> 31:29.373
Callie told us that she
wants to live with Robert.

31:29.854 --> 31:32.229
I heard, and I'm sorry.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.054
Look, um, we both know that Callie

31:35.504 --> 31:39.070
values everyone else's
well-being above her own.

31:39.125 --> 31:43.737
Especially Girls United. And,
um, I just think that Robert

31:44.034 --> 31:46.836
saw that and took advantage of it.

31:46.903 --> 31:48.294
And, um...

31:48.853 --> 31:50.998
[laughs] he delivered.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.422
'Cause this is a really beautiful house.

31:53.542 --> 31:54.935
OK, so,

31:55.312 --> 31:56.807
what are you implying?

31:57.001 --> 32:00.148
That I used Callie in
order to get this house?

32:00.184 --> 32:03.307
'Cause not only is that absurd,
it's actually a little bit offensive.

32:03.307 --> 32:07.221
You knew how much this
house would cost Callie,

32:07.707 --> 32:11.231
- and you exploited her anyway.
- Come on, Stef. OK? That's a bit of a stretch.

32:11.267 --> 32:12.215
First of all,

32:12.689 --> 32:15.630
Callie didn't even know this
house existed until today.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.896
Robert specifically
didn't want it to seem...

32:17.920 --> 32:19.712
Like exactly what it is?

32:23.109 --> 32:23.814
Stef,

32:24.093 --> 32:27.077
I realize that you and
Lena are very disappointed.

32:27.131 --> 32:30.436
We're not disappointed,
Rita. We're devastated.

32:31.432 --> 32:32.945
She's our daughter.

32:33.942 --> 32:36.439
And she's doing this out of obligation,

32:36.559 --> 32:40.370
or fear, because she does not wanna
be taken out of our house again.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.621
Or that's what she's telling
you, so you won't get hurt.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.250
- We're already hurt.
- Yes, I can see that.

32:48.451 --> 32:50.225
But wouldn't you be even more hurt

32:50.438 --> 32:52.892
if she told you she did feel
a connection with Robert,

32:52.905 --> 32:55.177
because he is her birth father?

32:59.369 --> 33:01.515
- Stef... Listen. I'm...
- Thanks, Rita.

33:01.533 --> 33:03.793
Listen. Stef.

33:11.054 --> 33:14.299
So it looks like we can get in
to see the judge this afternoon.

33:29.107 --> 33:32.107
We, uh, we love you very much.

33:32.506 --> 33:34.624
And we would never in a million years

33:34.908 --> 33:36.456
stop fighting to adopt you.

33:36.475 --> 33:38.877
But if you are tired of fighting and...

33:39.380 --> 33:42.909
... you want to go live with Robert
because he's your birth father, then, uh,

33:43.566 --> 33:46.853
we don't want you to feel
like you're letting us down.

33:46.973 --> 33:48.347
It's OK.

33:52.935 --> 33:55.340
From the very beginning,
all we've ever wanted

33:55.352 --> 33:57.436
is for you to have a safe and loving home.

33:58.645 --> 34:01.282
To have a family that
loves you unconditionally.

34:02.728 --> 34:06.495
So if this is what you truly want...

34:08.335 --> 34:10.826
... we will stand beside
you, today and everyday.

34:11.762 --> 34:14.126
Whether you're under our roof or not.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.550
Hey. Any word from April yet?

34:23.670 --> 34:25.367
No, but I think we're good.

34:25.379 --> 34:27.139
What's she gonna do, go
back and dance with Kaitlyn,

34:27.150 --> 34:29.597
after all the awful things
she said about her? Unlikely.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.007
Oh,

34:32.128 --> 34:33.819
hey! Welcome to the team!

34:34.121 --> 34:37.585
So, OK, so we were thinking practice
everyday after school and Saturdays...

34:37.601 --> 34:39.916
- I'm not joining your team.
- What?

34:39.969 --> 34:42.732
- You're going back to Kaitlyn?
- No, no way.

34:43.031 --> 34:44.681
Not after reading those texts.

34:44.902 --> 34:45.940
They were so mean.

34:45.978 --> 34:49.168
- Well, then why aren't you... ?
- Because sending them to me?

34:49.661 --> 34:51.583
Also really mean.

34:51.649 --> 34:53.293
I was just trying to have your back.

34:53.413 --> 34:56.061
Yeah, now that you want something from me.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.748
But what about when Kaitlyn was
saying all those awful things?

34:58.752 --> 35:00.354
Or when she cut me from the team?

35:00.393 --> 35:02.408
I was the one who said that
Kaitlyn was being unfair!

35:02.411 --> 35:05.086
- I was the one who spoke up for you!
- Maybe.

35:05.389 --> 35:07.637
But you didn't do anything.

35:08.349 --> 35:11.086
And actions really do
speak louder than words.

35:11.786 --> 35:13.742
Sending me those texts,

35:14.415 --> 35:16.243
that really said a lot, Mariana.

35:20.756 --> 35:21.791
Huh.

35:22.759 --> 35:25.218
Looks like I'm not the mean girl after all.

35:29.206 --> 35:32.196
I can't believe you did this!
I am trying to save your job!

35:32.209 --> 35:34.645
Why shouldn't the students be
aware of what's going on here?

35:34.949 --> 35:37.605
This is their education,
Lena, this is their school.

35:37.641 --> 35:39.883
They have the most to lose, or gain.

35:39.901 --> 35:42.830
Oh, I see. And you are going to be
the neutral arbiter of this debate?

35:42.950 --> 35:44.379
What is your goal here, Timothy?

35:44.416 --> 35:46.124
To turn the student body
against the administration?

35:46.125 --> 35:48.061
- My goal here, Lena, is simply to...
- Hey.

35:49.450 --> 35:50.677
What's going on?

35:56.689 --> 35:59.946
Unfortunately, students, I will
not be teaching class today.

36:00.066 --> 36:02.699
- What? Why?
- I've, uh...

36:03.619 --> 36:04.777
I've been fired.

36:04.977 --> 36:06.059
- No way!
- What?

36:06.179 --> 36:08.112
- Are you kidding?
- Disappointingly,

36:08.124 --> 36:10.157
the new administration
at Anchor Beach wants me

36:10.187 --> 36:11.893
to teach you how to take tests,

36:11.932 --> 36:12.938
not how to think.

36:14.202 --> 36:15.772
And I won't do that.

36:20.293 --> 36:24.555
You all have vibrant and
brilliant young minds,

36:24.675 --> 36:26.549
and I encourage you to use them.

36:26.669 --> 36:29.824
Speak up for yourselves.
This is your school,

36:29.825 --> 36:31.571
your education.

36:32.578 --> 36:34.933
Never forget that.

36:43.391 --> 36:44.958
All right.

36:45.385 --> 36:46.724
Hello, everyone.

36:47.028 --> 36:49.980
It seems I will be teaching class today.

36:50.521 --> 36:52.552
If, uh, someone will just
tell me where Timothy...

36:52.581 --> 36:54.271
Timothy is, like, our favorite teacher.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.270
- How could you just fire him?
- I can't believe this.

36:57.319 --> 37:00.455
The administration had to
make a very difficult decision.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.839
- I'm sorry to say it, but Timothy wasn't...
- And we have no say?

37:03.906 --> 37:06.069
- It's not up for debate.
- Fine.

37:06.366 --> 37:08.122
But I'm not just gonna
sit here and take it.

37:08.171 --> 37:10.572
- Mariana, sit down.
- Timothy was right.

37:10.784 --> 37:12.929
This is our school. If we
don't like something about it,

37:12.947 --> 37:14.661
we have to do something to change it.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.146
I'm walking out.

37:18.532 --> 37:20.015
Who's with me?

37:20.598 --> 37:23.508

37:56.726 --> 38:00.432

38:15.001 --> 38:17.444
I took Tasha from the
park on Christmas Eve.

38:17.832 --> 38:19.849
But right away I knew it was a mistake.

38:20.354 --> 38:22.835
So I took her back to
her foster home that night

38:22.870 --> 38:25.039
and watched her walk up to the door.

38:25.574 --> 38:27.748
When her foster parents opened the door

38:28.241 --> 38:29.887
and I knew she was safe,

38:30.604 --> 38:31.747
I ran off.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.599
I see. And was anyone with you?

38:36.474 --> 38:39.075
- Did anyone help?
- No.

38:39.470 --> 38:40.187
Really?

38:40.709 --> 38:41.706
Nobody?

38:42.788 --> 38:43.675
Nope.

38:44.349 --> 38:45.880
It was just me.
