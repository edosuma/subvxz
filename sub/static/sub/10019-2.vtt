<i>It's another steamer today.</i>
<i>Hot, muggy weather.</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:14.517
<i>High in the 90s with high humidity.</i>

00:14.747 --> 00:17.332
<i>They say never trust air you can't see,</i>
<i>and you'll see it today...</i>

00:17.563 --> 00:20.018

<i>humid weather.</i>

00:38.007 --> 00:41.323
I'm running over today. I hope
I'm not making you late for work.

00:41.590 --> 00:43.117
No. I'm not on until this afternoon.

00:43.382 --> 00:45.389
I did my Residency at County.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.621
Three years of too many patients,
too little time and no resources.

00:48.853 --> 00:51.241
- Sounds about right.
- Hard to believe we had no CTs...

00:51.445 --> 00:53.332
...no MRIs and glass IV bottles.

00:53.556 --> 00:54.603
Glass?

00:55.988 --> 00:58.126
Well, your lab work's back...

00:58.355 --> 01:02.380
...and the results show a viral load
of 15,000, which is good.

01:02.675 --> 01:04.976
- Coffee?
- I've already had too much.

01:05.202 --> 01:06.412
So have I.

01:07.314 --> 01:11.088
There's a fairly new HIV cocktail
that I recommend you start on now.

01:11.313 --> 01:12.360
The three drugs?

01:12.625 --> 01:14.763
AZT, 3TC and a protease inhibitor.

01:15.632 --> 01:19.461
There is no long-term research but
the preliminary findings are positive.

01:19.727 --> 01:20.807
Not quite a cure.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.275
But more hope than we've had
in a decade.

01:23.471 --> 01:24.899
There may be some side effects.

01:25.134 --> 01:27.949
- Nausea, vomiting, rash.
- How much does it cost?

01:28.174 --> 01:29.734
Your insurance will cover it.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.558
Actually, I'm gonna stick with cash.

01:31.789 --> 01:34.919
That could cost up to $ 16,000 a year.

01:35.532 --> 01:37.320
I'm sure I can work that out.

01:38.764 --> 01:40.770
Afraid of letting the hospital know?

01:41.003 --> 01:42.694
I've heard of health-care workers...

01:42.923 --> 01:45.890
...getting fired or reassigned
for being HIV-positive.

01:46.602 --> 01:49.122
Me too. I've got a couple of them
as patients.

01:49.386 --> 01:52.102
But not from County.
I don't know what their policy is.

01:52.457 --> 01:55.456
It's hard to ask without someone
wanting to know why you're asking.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.169
I'll write the prescription,
but these will get you started, okay?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.156
You're to take two of the 3TC...

02:01.384 --> 02:04.515
...and six each of the AZT
and the protease inhibitor.

02:04.743 --> 02:06.401
Fourteen pills a day?

02:06.631 --> 02:08.419
The 3TC twice a day
with plenty of water.

02:08.646 --> 02:11.613
The protease inhibitor before meals,
always on an empty stomach.

02:11.845 --> 02:14.747
Two each of the AZT three times a day.

02:19.461 --> 02:22.275
Just follow these written
instructions, okay?

02:23.236 --> 02:25.723
Does your watch have an alarm?

02:26.755 --> 02:28.696
Good. Get used to hearing it.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.095
Miss a couple of doses, and this virus
could develop resistance.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.441
Do I need to worry about
transmitting this to a patient?

02:36.673 --> 02:38.233
If you use universal precautions...

02:38.464 --> 02:41.115
...and are careful,
there shouldn't be a problem.

02:41.793 --> 02:44.159
- "Shouldn't."
- With the exception of one dentist...

02:44.383 --> 02:47.001
...there has been
no case documentation...

02:47.231 --> 02:50.427
...of any health-care worker
transmitting HIV to a patient.

02:51.358 --> 02:52.252
None.

02:53.598 --> 02:55.507
So I'll see you in three weeks?

02:56.990 --> 02:58.233
Three weeks.

03:03.261 --> 03:06.042
There are a lot of diseases
that can take your life.

03:06.268 --> 03:08.656
But this one
can take over your life.

03:08.891 --> 03:10.265
Don't let it.

04:22.414 --> 04:23.624
Are you the doctor?

04:25.037 --> 04:28.931
I saw the name on the mailbox.
John Truman Carter, M.D.?

04:30.509 --> 04:32.232
Well, I am Betty.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.874
From 318.
Are you a doctor doctor?

04:37.355 --> 04:39.689
Because I'm feeling short of breath.

04:39.978 --> 04:42.018
You might want to lose the cigarettes.

04:42.794 --> 04:45.411
You think that might
make a difference at my age?

04:45.962 --> 04:47.423
Just a wild guess.

04:47.657 --> 04:51.617
I tried one of those humidifiers.
I stuck my whole head in the thing...

04:51.848 --> 04:53.058
Wait! What time is it?

04:55.879 --> 04:58.334
I just turned off
<i>Regis and Kathie Lee.</i>

04:58.599 --> 05:01.533
Oh, God!
Benton is gonna kill me!

05:01.894 --> 05:06.171
I can't help you now. Sorry, I'm late,
and I am going to die soon.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.187
Maybe you should try
an albuterol inhaler.

05:09.381 --> 05:11.802
Maybe an atrovent inhaler.
That kind of thing.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.836
Get off me!
I want to get out of here!

05:20.067 --> 05:22.456
- What happened?
- I can't take these fat people on PCP!

05:22.691 --> 05:23.705
Broke out of her restraints.

05:23.938 --> 05:25.629
Where's Security?

05:25.858 --> 05:26.873
Where are the men?

05:27.106 --> 05:30.717
Get off me, you bitches!
I want to get out of here!

05:31.969 --> 05:33.016
Sorry, sir.

05:38.144 --> 05:39.038
We gotta get her down!

05:41.951 --> 05:43.128
Keep her down! Sit on her!

05:46.046 --> 05:46.809
Are you okay?

05:47.166 --> 05:50.394
Is this psycho day? Some lunatic in 4
kept trying to lick me.

05:50.622 --> 05:52.858
Maybe it's the heat.

05:53.085 --> 05:53.946
Full moon?

05:54.172 --> 05:57.619
They know County's closing, and
they're getting their last digs in.

05:58.556 --> 05:59.636
In here, right?

05:59.868 --> 06:02.039
What the hell kept you?

06:02.300 --> 06:04.820
We got the call five minutes ago.
We ran all the way.

06:06.939 --> 06:09.873
You don't think County's really
gonna close, do you? Can it?

06:10.106 --> 06:14.164
Have you read the papers?
$ 150 million shortfall in the budget.

06:14.361 --> 06:16.052
Be tough giving this all up,
won't it?

06:16.729 --> 06:18.638
- Where's Carter?
- Do I look like his mother?

06:22.392 --> 06:23.918
Randi! Have you seen Carter?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.834
He's a surgical intern now.
We don't keep track of him anymore.

06:27.062 --> 06:29.396
Sorry you were late.
We already saved him.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.077
- I'm not late.
- You know Wayne Lentloff?

06:32.342 --> 06:34.229
Good to see you.
You missed a good one!

06:34.485 --> 06:36.078
- Nobody called me.
- Thanks, Wayne.

06:36.341 --> 06:37.618
It was fun.
We'll do it again.

06:37.845 --> 06:42.284
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about a fellowship in Cardiothoracic.

06:43.156 --> 06:45.130
I haven't made up my mind
what specialty...

06:45.332 --> 06:48.680
I know. I hear Vascular wants you,
Trauma, Critical Care...

06:48.915 --> 06:50.605
I talked to them, but you know...

06:50.835 --> 06:54.958
But you need to talk to us.
Cardiothoracic is a great specialty.

06:55.217 --> 06:58.665
Good man like you could finish up
a fellowship in three years.

06:58.897 --> 07:01.514
Are you free Sunday?
I'd like you to come out for brunch.

07:01.744 --> 07:04.199
Lake Forest.
And you are gonna love it.

07:06.575 --> 07:09.641
- Want a ride?
- I think I can make it from here.

07:10.575 --> 07:12.036
So how did it go last night?

07:12.303 --> 07:13.960
- How did what go?
- Your blind date.

07:14.190 --> 07:15.269
Oh, God!

07:15.470 --> 07:17.258
You know better than to tell Doug.

07:17.485 --> 07:20.354
I only told him after
he told me about your blind date.

07:20.589 --> 07:23.403
- The girl with the retainer.
- I don't believe him.

07:23.629 --> 07:26.498
- Don't worry. Mine was worse.
- Nothing could be worse.

07:26.732 --> 07:29.993
This girl had an entire vegetable
garden stuck in her teeth.

07:30.219 --> 07:32.902
That's the baby pool compared to Tad.

07:33.771 --> 07:36.104
- Could I get a cup of coffee, black?
- You got it.

07:36.362 --> 07:38.337
I can't believe you'd go out
with a guy named Tad.

07:38.857 --> 07:41.672
- I did.
- I made it fresh just for you.

07:43.625 --> 07:46.112
Fresh from yesterday's grounds.

07:46.408 --> 07:49.724
First of all, I order a Manhattan
straight up, two cherries.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.123
He orders a fruity, yet selfless,
glass of cabernet.

07:53.351 --> 07:55.292
- What does that even mean?
- I have no idea.

07:55.526 --> 07:59.420
Then he talks for 45 minutes
about his ex-girlfriend...

07:59.653 --> 08:01.278
...whose name also happens to be Susan.

08:01.510 --> 08:03.843
How he loved her
and wanted to marry her...

08:04.069 --> 08:06.010
...how he wanted to father her
5 or 6 children.

08:06.244 --> 08:10.270
And, by the way, do I want children?
Do I want 5 or 6 children?

08:10.883 --> 08:12.257
Okay. Tad could be worse.

08:12.483 --> 08:13.562
I'm not even there yet, Mark.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.688
I look over, and he has this drop
of red wine hanging from his nose.

08:17.987 --> 08:20.921
- What?
- A little blob just hanging there.

08:21.121 --> 08:23.542
Of course I cannot take my eyes
off of it.

08:23.777 --> 08:25.948
Will it fall?
Will it hang there all night?

08:26.176 --> 08:27.769
Is his skin going to absorb it?

08:28.000 --> 08:28.982
How did it get there?

08:29.888 --> 08:32.921
How do you get your nose
that far into a wine glass?

08:33.150 --> 08:34.972
What, was he smelling it?

08:36.671 --> 08:37.565
What happened?

08:37.791 --> 08:40.125
I went to the bathroom
and snuck out the window.

08:40.381 --> 08:41.811
You're kidding!

09:33.397 --> 09:35.884
- Did he ask you to brunch?
- How did you know?

09:36.116 --> 09:38.799
Wayne Lentloff is nothing
if not predictable.

09:39.027 --> 09:40.652
That's why I like him, actually.

09:40.883 --> 09:44.199
He gets the Residents
out to Lake Forest every year.

09:44.467 --> 09:46.735
Shows them the
seven-bedroom Colonial...

09:46.962 --> 09:49.896
...the tiered garden,
the Olympic lap pool...

09:51.377 --> 09:52.238
Very impressive.

09:52.464 --> 09:54.668
All the benefits
of cardiothoracic surgery.

09:54.865 --> 09:58.726
Of course, we're only in it to
help our fellow man, aren't we...?

09:58.960 --> 10:01.032
- What's your name?
- Gant. Dennis Gant.

10:01.263 --> 10:02.245
Step in, Mr. Gant.

10:02.479 --> 10:05.774
Take a look-see while I divide
this anterior rectus fascia.

10:05.998 --> 10:08.845
- Tonsil clamp.
- A little Bovie, please.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.245
Not you, Gant.

10:11.469 --> 10:14.119
Boys and girls in Vascular
pull you aside?

10:14.349 --> 10:15.974
That's mostly diabetics
and smokers.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.853
- Not for me.
- How about a Pediatric fellowship?

10:19.116 --> 10:21.287
Surgery above and below the diaphragm.

10:21.515 --> 10:22.977
Very high-tech.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.803
Actually, no one's asked me.

10:25.419 --> 10:28.266
Hard as it is to believe,
some of the elite fellowships...

10:28.458 --> 10:30.247
...you'll have to go after yourself.

10:33.418 --> 10:36.167
Dr. Gant was kind enough
to cover the ER...

10:36.393 --> 10:38.694
...seeing as you were nowhere
to be found.

10:38.921 --> 10:41.025
Perhaps you should do the same
for him.

10:42.471 --> 10:44.675
Let's yank this little
hyperemic sucker.

10:44.903 --> 10:46.397
Pean clamp!

10:46.631 --> 10:47.459
Got it?

10:47.686 --> 10:50.272
The key to landing a good job
is presentation.

10:50.534 --> 10:53.632
I'm not gonna dress like you,
if that's what you mean.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.992
"Two summers, Assistant
Night Manager at McDonald's."

10:57.220 --> 11:00.832
It's a bit of a lie. I just
manned the drive-through window.

11:01.028 --> 11:01.976
That's better.

11:02.212 --> 11:05.310
That's managing the communication
and distribution system...

11:05.540 --> 11:08.605
...of an international
Fortune 500 company.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.347
I like that. What you're saying
is, make it a big lie.

11:12.578 --> 11:14.999
Semantics can be your friend, Jerry.

11:15.234 --> 11:17.437
Some guy's puking over at Chairs.

11:17.665 --> 11:18.614
I'll get it.

11:18.849 --> 11:21.215
Did you get the liquor out of 4 yet?

11:21.952 --> 11:23.512
You can't bother him now.

11:23.776 --> 11:27.485
He's rephrasing his r Ásum Á.
Going for the presidency of Chrysler?

11:27.711 --> 11:31.158
It's not necessarily County that'll
close. There are three other hospitals.

11:31.359 --> 11:34.358
But what if it does? I only got
eight hours' worth of savings.

11:34.590 --> 11:37.590
You ought to get E-Ray
to help you revise your r Ásum Ás.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.603
I'm a nurse. How many ways
can you rephrase that?

11:40.829 --> 11:44.657
Mark said something about a couple of
teenagers. Is there a chart on them?

11:44.892 --> 11:47.575
I haven't made one up yet.
Two 15-year-olds.

11:47.803 --> 11:49.690
- Mark said he'd see them.
- Who am I seeing?

11:49.915 --> 11:52.216
- The 15-year-olds over at Chairs.
- Right.

11:52.475 --> 11:55.823
An 81 -year-old ALOC with abdominal
pain coming in by private.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.261
- Anything surgical?
- Nope. <i>Nada.</i> Nothing.

11:58.490 --> 12:00.824
Abdominal pain at the back door.

12:01.081 --> 12:03.797
Susan, can you help me
with a chest tube?

12:03.993 --> 12:05.519
I'm gonna see those kids.

12:05.752 --> 12:08.086
Did you get a chance
to read that synopsis...

12:08.312 --> 12:10.221
...of Donald Anspaugh's speech
at Northwestern?

12:10.456 --> 12:13.270
"Modern Architecture for
Emergency Medicine Management"?

12:13.495 --> 12:16.015
Anspaugh?
Isn't he the chief at Southside?

12:16.246 --> 12:18.963
Doug did his rotation there.
He said the guy's a crackpot.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.906
You might want to consider the source
on that evaluation.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.370
I found his ideas intriguing.

12:24.629 --> 12:28.272
Rearranging the physical layout here
is not one of my priorities.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.118
Could we at least rearrange
where our Security sits?

12:31.347 --> 12:34.096
Three nurses had to restrain
a PCP patient this morning...

12:34.291 --> 12:36.495
...because they took too long
to get there.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.373
- Was anybody hurt?
- Fortunately, no.

12:39.602 --> 12:42.057
You know, Mark,
just because it's my suggestion...

12:42.290 --> 12:45.606
...it doesn't, by definition,
make it a bad idea.

12:48.016 --> 12:52.009
She just has a way of making you feel
really small, doesn't she?

12:57.743 --> 13:00.361
Sorry. I had no idea
they'd send the bill to you.

13:00.622 --> 13:02.956
Your insurance company doesn't pay.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.580
You think the hospital's
just gonna eat it?

13:05.837 --> 13:09.797
I don't know. What do they do
with immigrants and poor people?

13:09.996 --> 13:13.312
They go after anyone who's legally
responsible. That's me, Al.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.362
We're still married, remember?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.024
I screwed up when I changed jobs.

13:17.259 --> 13:21.219
This guy I'm working for, he's
independent. Doesn't give benefits.

13:21.450 --> 13:25.540
CTA said I could stay on their plan.
But there was this Cobra payment.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.776
I had no idea I missed it.

13:29.193 --> 13:30.753
It was real confusing.

13:31.624 --> 13:35.006
They're gonna let me know
if I can get reinstated.

13:37.127 --> 13:38.883
Can it maybe go on your insurance?

13:39.527 --> 13:40.804
You're not on my insurance.

13:41.031 --> 13:43.397
I joined my plan after we separated.

13:43.622 --> 13:48.193
$3200 is what I'm supposed to pay for
you? And in a week I get another bill?

14:03.459 --> 14:06.425
Thomas, time to come in!
Where are you?

14:06.690 --> 14:10.432
Franklin Heath, 81. Sweet old guy
looking for someone named Thomas.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.559
His private-duty nurse,
Mr. Travels, is over there bulking up.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.450
- He looks dedicated.
- He's dumping him?

14:15.680 --> 14:16.924
It's not for me to say.

14:17.152 --> 14:19.159
He's done this a number of times.

14:19.391 --> 14:20.438
Always on a Friday.

14:20.671 --> 14:23.966
- Thomas, it's getting dark.
- Carol, what happened to your car?

14:24.190 --> 14:26.394
- What do you mean?
- A tow truck hauled it off.

14:26.622 --> 14:29.589
Go, I'll take care of this.

14:29.822 --> 14:31.545
Strong old guy, isn't he?

14:31.773 --> 14:33.017
Where are you, Thomas?

14:34.781 --> 14:36.188
Wait, wait, wait!

14:39.708 --> 14:40.820
That's my car!

14:41.052 --> 14:43.702
- Stop beating on my truck.
- Stop stealing my car.

14:43.899 --> 14:45.360
You Carol Hathaway?

14:46.395 --> 14:47.605
Repossessed.

14:49.082 --> 14:51.570
- That can't be right.
- You missed three payments.

14:51.802 --> 14:54.768
So I'm a little late.
I made the other seven on time.

15:00.216 --> 15:04.306
I know that you did, which is why
I thought tonight we could...

15:04.823 --> 15:08.270
I understand. Your parents
don't come into town that often.

15:10.550 --> 15:13.267
I'd love to meet them,
but I'm working tonight.

15:14.838 --> 15:16.561
What time do they go to bed?

15:17.940 --> 15:19.282
I'm kidding.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.049
I'll talk to you soon.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.074
That's an old friend from college.

15:29.491 --> 15:30.505
Radiology called.

15:30.738 --> 15:32.909
The films on that Burman kid are back.

15:33.138 --> 15:36.782
You want to rephrase your r Ásum Á,
you should talk to him, not E-Ray.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.561
- I heard your car got towed.
- It's a mistake.

15:39.825 --> 15:43.140
I know a couple guys who can
track a repo man down like that.

15:43.888 --> 15:44.782
If you want.

15:45.008 --> 15:47.626
Carter said I should tell you
he's in Curtain 3.

15:50.287 --> 15:51.530
Nurse Hathaway?

15:51.759 --> 15:52.652
You're still here.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.820
We've been sitting there
like you told us.

15:55.054 --> 15:58.534
- That doctor never showed.
- Lf you tell me, I could help you.

15:59.213 --> 16:00.674
We need to see a doctor.

16:02.092 --> 16:03.466
- Where's Ross?
- Radiology.

16:03.693 --> 16:05.154
- Greene?
- Trauma 2.

16:05.388 --> 16:06.151
Follow me.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.804
BP's 100 over 50. Pulse 120.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.921
- Good bilateral breath sounds.
- Toes upgoing.

16:11.147 --> 16:14.758
- Trachea's midline.
- ET tube's 71/2.

16:14.986 --> 16:17.735
- You said you'd see these kids.
- We were diverted.

16:17.961 --> 16:20.449
They need a doctor, and I'd
like to do your job for you...

16:20.649 --> 16:23.267
Thank you. Perhaps they
could wait a little longer?

16:23.497 --> 16:25.536
Let's get a noncontrast head CT.

16:25.769 --> 16:29.729
You know where you were waiting
before? Go back there and wait again.

16:32.807 --> 16:34.716
BP's 90 over 60. Pulse 104.

16:34.951 --> 16:37.765
He's been agitated,
complaining of abdominal pain.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.062
That is when he's not
looking for Thomas.

16:41.061 --> 16:42.305
- Who's Thomas?
- Who knows?

16:42.565 --> 16:46.077
Let's order a CBC, Chem-7, UA,
abdominal series. And let's get an EKG.

16:46.308 --> 16:49.242
- Lf you don't need me anymore...
- Have a nice weekend, Mr. Travels.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.614
Thomas, come on in.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.273
Dinner is ready.

16:54.819 --> 16:55.680
What are you doing?

16:55.907 --> 16:59.583
An 81 -year-old ALOC complaining
of abdominal pain. No vomiting...

16:59.810 --> 17:02.265
...and yesterday had a normal
bowel movement.

17:03.554 --> 17:07.295
Mild tenderness, no rebound or
guarding. You have nothing here.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.941
- Did someone dump him?
- That's a possibility.

17:11.455 --> 17:13.211
I suggest you do the same.

17:13.471 --> 17:15.859
You're in Surgery,
not Geriatrics, okay?

17:17.951 --> 17:20.765
I'm sorry about my blowup before.
It was out of line.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.128
- No excuses whatsoever.
- Don't worry about it.

17:23.325 --> 17:25.877
Thanks. Can I borrow your motorcycle
after lunch?

17:26.108 --> 17:26.936
What?

17:27.165 --> 17:29.815
I have to be at my house at 3:00.
My car got towed...

17:30.044 --> 17:31.800
...and I won't have time
to catch the EI.

17:32.028 --> 17:34.329
- We're gonna grab a drink.
- Walk with us.

17:34.556 --> 17:37.108
- Talk to you later.
- I'll check on those kids.

17:37.339 --> 17:40.754
- You know how to ride a motorcycle?
- It's like a big moped, right?

17:40.987 --> 17:42.393
I guess.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.035
I'm Dr. Lewis.
What seems to be the problem?

17:46.298 --> 17:48.305
- A woman doctor?
- Best I could do.

17:48.889 --> 17:50.993
We could call your parents
if you prefer.

17:57.847 --> 17:59.505
We lost our condom.

18:02.455 --> 18:04.975
So you're trying to tell us
the condom is...

18:05.366 --> 18:08.300
Deeply, deeply lost.

18:11.093 --> 18:13.264
- The decision wasn't being made
for another week.

18:13.492 --> 18:16.339
That's what we thought until
they called this meeting.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.891
They gave no indication as to what
the outcome was going to be?

18:20.148 --> 18:22.002
<i>Nada. Niente.</i> Zip.

18:22.259 --> 18:26.001
Could be us, Southside
or Central. Someone's closing down.

18:26.226 --> 18:28.778
I got this. Here you go, Manny.
Three cans of pop.

18:29.009 --> 18:30.919
- I didn't think they'd do it.
- Neither did I.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.455
Neither did Anspaugh.
He called me about it.

18:33.681 --> 18:36.201
Sounded like he was having
a psychosensory disturbance.

18:36.432 --> 18:38.374
- He's afraid he's losing his job.
- You know him?

18:38.608 --> 18:42.087
I did two years of Residency at
Hennepin with him. The guy's lumpy.

18:42.319 --> 18:44.261
Well, I rather like him.

18:45.006 --> 18:47.624
Give it time. He eats
med students for breakfast...

18:47.886 --> 18:51.813
...Residents for lunch, and he
chews up the Attendings for dinner.

18:52.078 --> 18:55.874
There was this guy, Michaelson. He was
a new ER Attending when I was there.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.987
Anspaugh vetoed every research topic
he submitted.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.528
- What for?
- He just didn't like him.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.454
Wanted to make sure he didn't
get tenure.

19:04.683 --> 19:07.049
- The meeting's at 5:00?
- I want you two there.

19:07.275 --> 19:10.886
Don't mention it to the staff.
They're nervous enough as it is.

19:14.185 --> 19:16.127
Could we possibly be out of Decadron?

19:16.361 --> 19:18.270
It's on one of the top shelves.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.598
They repoed your car, huh?

19:22.855 --> 19:25.604
- You knew that, didn't you?
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.797
- You're such a coward.
- And you have a problem with that?

19:29.030 --> 19:31.397
I'm strapped right now.
I could help you next month.

19:31.590 --> 19:34.371
Thanks, but I'm beyond
a little help from my friends.

19:34.598 --> 19:36.899
I'm meeting a realtor today
to sell my house.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.230
That's news.

19:39.461 --> 19:41.948
It needs so much work.
I haven't paid for the roof...

19:42.180 --> 19:44.285
...and I don't know if I have
a job next week.

19:45.795 --> 19:47.934
How's life with you?
How's Gretchen?

19:49.859 --> 19:52.128
- The one who went to Smith?
- Gretchen is fine.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.297
And now I am armed
with my trusty Decadron...

19:55.778 --> 19:58.712
...and I'm gonna go out
and cure the croup.

20:01.281 --> 20:04.063
- What did Morgenstern want?
- I can't tell you.

20:04.832 --> 20:08.955
There's a meeting at 5:00 to announce
whether we're shut down or not.

20:09.183 --> 20:11.703
- That's the bad news, huh?
- Don't worry about it yet.

20:11.935 --> 20:14.968
- Well, if it affects my vacation...
- Vacation?

20:15.198 --> 20:17.205
I'm going to Hawaii. I decided.

20:17.438 --> 20:18.201
What?

20:18.429 --> 20:22.073
Nothing. I thought you might be
worried about your Residency.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.929
Any news yet?
Are we jobless?

20:24.188 --> 20:25.268
No news.

20:25.533 --> 20:27.954
You can have the rumors
if you'd like to hear them.

20:28.219 --> 20:30.455
No, thanks.
This day's been bad enough.

20:30.684 --> 20:34.098
Call me crazy, but I think that woman's
trying to get your attention.

20:36.858 --> 20:38.450
What is she doing here?

20:44.632 --> 20:47.665
- Manny, what happened?
- I think I ate something.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.782
- You okay?
- This day's getting worse.

20:50.008 --> 20:50.989
Great.

20:55.159 --> 20:56.784
Anybody seen E-Ray?

20:59.446 --> 21:01.006
Mrs. Bradley? Alex?

21:01.942 --> 21:04.046
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- That's okay.

21:04.277 --> 21:06.099
Let's take a look here.

21:06.964 --> 21:08.971
- That's not too bad.
- It didn't hurt.

21:09.204 --> 21:10.960
No, I wouldn't think so.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.365
How did you cut that?

21:12.595 --> 21:15.083
- On the top of a can of tennis balls.
- He's taking lessons.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.689
I hate them.

21:16.947 --> 21:17.808
How much?

21:18.034 --> 21:19.016
What do you mean?

21:19.730 --> 21:22.992
As much as doing your homework?
As much as going to the dentist?

21:23.218 --> 21:24.461
Definitely as much as both.

21:24.690 --> 21:28.366
I hate it as much as taking the trash
out, cleaning up after the dog.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.559
- You wanted a dog.
- Well, I didn't want Robert.

21:31.856 --> 21:35.598
Don't talk like that about your
brother. You know better than that.

21:35.823 --> 21:37.230
- He loves you.
- I know.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.913
- And who feeds the dog? Me.
- No, you don't.

21:40.110 --> 21:43.971
Those shots you get at the dentist,
Novocain, you're not allergic to those?

21:46.573 --> 21:50.434
They stuck these things in my nose
and gave me this oxygen tank...

21:50.668 --> 21:52.675
...to take home with me.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.809
And that inhaler thing,
it didn't work at all.

21:57.035 --> 21:58.977
Betty, you can't smoke in here.

21:59.211 --> 22:03.366
You can't smoke around this oxygen
tank, even at home. It'll blow up.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.585
I want you to know...

22:08.521 --> 22:10.310
...that I asked for you specially.

22:11.145 --> 22:12.900
Thank you. Very flattered.

22:13.768 --> 22:16.866
Malik needs you in 3!
It's about an old guy, a Mr. Heath?

22:17.095 --> 22:17.891
I'll be right back.

22:18.119 --> 22:21.152
Call Carol.
And page Dr. Lewis or Greene.

22:24.390 --> 22:26.724
- Oh, God!
- He's bradying down.

22:26.950 --> 22:28.705
- Get a mask on him.
- What happened?

22:28.934 --> 22:30.624
He arrested.
The monitor's flatline.

22:30.853 --> 22:32.827
- Where's Dr. Lewis and Greene?
- I paged them.

22:33.092 --> 22:35.710
- Want me to call his nurse?
- Mr. Travels has gone traveling.

22:36.740 --> 22:37.819
Let's give him...

22:38.084 --> 22:39.742
- You're pumping too hard.
- Thank you.

22:39.971 --> 22:41.378
- How about an amp of...?
- Epi!

22:41.635 --> 22:43.260
And a mg of atropine.

22:45.570 --> 22:46.846
I think I just broke his rib.

22:48.353 --> 22:50.044
I'm getting a faint pulse!

22:56.225 --> 22:59.901
10 mics per kg.
That's about 1200 mics.

23:00.127 --> 23:01.621
Give him 500 mics of dopamine.

23:01.855 --> 23:03.164
Damn good job, Carter.

23:03.391 --> 23:05.147
I'll call for transfer.

23:06.879 --> 23:08.634
I can't believe I broke his rib.

23:08.862 --> 23:11.228
- I knew he was frail, but...
- Better than letting him die.

23:13.277 --> 23:14.771
Transfer him up to Medicine.

23:14.972 --> 23:18.267
I got a hernia that needs an H & P
upstairs now. Let's go.

24:05.843 --> 24:06.858
Hello?

24:13.394 --> 24:14.736
Mrs. Puro?

24:16.113 --> 24:17.095
Hi there.

24:17.298 --> 24:19.981
I'm sorry I'm late.
How did you get in?

24:20.209 --> 24:22.575
Your mother.
She makes a killer cup of coffee.

24:22.801 --> 24:25.222
There you are.
I was going to call the hospital.

24:25.456 --> 24:29.230
- What are you doing here?
- Material for the kitchen curtains.

24:29.455 --> 24:33.033
- I thought I'd drop it off.
- I'm glad you changed your mind.

24:33.582 --> 24:35.109
- About what?
- About selling.

24:35.342 --> 24:37.097
I told Elizabeth.

24:38.029 --> 24:39.491
First names only in my business.

24:39.757 --> 24:41.699
I told her you must have
changed your mind.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.458
Why else would we put up curtains?

24:43.725 --> 24:46.277
- Not to sell it.
- No. It wouldn't help.

24:46.508 --> 24:49.060
Why don't you see how they'd look
in the bedroom?

24:49.291 --> 24:51.014
You want the same in the bedroom?

24:51.211 --> 24:53.033
We'll talk about it later.

24:53.451 --> 24:56.417
I haven't changed my mind.
I want to sell this place.

24:57.322 --> 24:58.369
You're kidding.

24:59.434 --> 25:00.644
Is there a problem?

25:01.257 --> 25:03.329
How can I put this delicately?

25:03.849 --> 25:06.695
I couldn't sell this house
if Chicago burned down around it.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.123
- I know it needs work, but...
- The roof is...

25:09.352 --> 25:10.464
The roof is new!

25:10.696 --> 25:12.735
I was going to say the roof is fine.

25:12.999 --> 25:17.188
But the furnace doesn't even turn on.
Not to mention the asbestos.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.454
There's no central air,
no window unit.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.908
Exposed 2-by-4s, dry wall.
There are holes in the carpet...

25:24.101 --> 25:27.362
...which, unfortunately,
reveal the subterranean termites.

25:27.588 --> 25:30.883
The plumbing's not copper, the
electrical's a fire waiting to happen.

25:31.108 --> 25:34.403
And as much as I hate to mention it,
you live next to the El tracks.

25:34.627 --> 25:38.303
Frankly, I'm impressed someone managed
to sell it to you.

25:39.139 --> 25:42.935
A month after the abscess was drained,
she had to have a hysterectomy.

25:43.170 --> 25:45.919
My God was she in pain then!

25:46.145 --> 25:48.795
Weeks, weeks, weeks!

25:49.025 --> 25:53.082
And what's so unfair is that with
all four of our kids, cesareans...

25:53.280 --> 25:55.102
...which is a lot of slicing...

25:55.327 --> 25:57.814
...couldn't stand up straight
until 1987.

25:58.046 --> 26:00.086
You can see why with
this hernia thing...

26:01.215 --> 26:04.214
...which is also somewhat
in the middle...

26:04.446 --> 26:07.479
...I'm obviously a little nervous.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.556
Being able to talk to you is helping.
I'm very grateful.

26:10.780 --> 26:14.325
I won't be able to do this when
I'm out and Doctor... What's his name?

26:14.844 --> 26:16.731
- Benton.
- That's it. Benton.

26:16.955 --> 26:19.191
When I'm under the knife,
and he starts cutting...

26:19.419 --> 26:21.752
Oh, my God! My God!

26:22.010 --> 26:24.399
What if I don't come out of this?

26:24.666 --> 26:25.843
I won't know what happened.

26:26.041 --> 26:29.423
Have you considered having a local
anesthetic instead of a general?

26:29.849 --> 26:31.191
I didn't know I had a choice.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.160
The advantage to a local is that...

26:34.392 --> 26:38.669
...while you feel no pain, you're
awake and you can talk to the surgeon.

26:38.904 --> 26:41.075
- Can I ask questions?
- Dr. Benton encourages it.

26:41.303 --> 26:43.277
- In the middle of surgery?
- All the way through.

26:43.895 --> 26:48.084
In fact, you could read up
on hernias in this book.

26:48.342 --> 26:51.025
And anything you don't understand...

26:51.253 --> 26:53.009
...you can ask Dr. Benton.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.642
That's great.

27:00.179 --> 27:02.699
Ross was looking for you.
Some kid needs suturing.

27:02.931 --> 27:05.581
I have to go to Radiology
and the cath lab.

27:05.810 --> 27:09.126
- Have you seen Mark?
- I believe he is lounging.

27:09.490 --> 27:10.504
Come on!

27:11.313 --> 27:13.898
All right, all right!
My turn. Time's up.

27:14.289 --> 27:15.336
This is a...

27:15.856 --> 27:18.376
- There you are!
- I'm not talking to you.

27:18.608 --> 27:21.455
You know, you made poor Tad very sad.

27:21.871 --> 27:23.497
What did he say?

27:23.791 --> 27:25.481
- You don't even know him!
- Gotcha!

27:25.711 --> 27:27.019
That's a low one, Doug.

27:29.774 --> 27:33.003
I take it you don't want me to tell
anybody about your date tonight.

27:34.061 --> 27:35.174
You have another date?

27:36.525 --> 27:38.051
I hate this place.

27:42.956 --> 27:45.192
It's right there.
She hit it with her hand.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.999
It would be better if we sewed them.

27:49.226 --> 27:51.495
Everything in this house
could be better!

27:51.753 --> 27:52.681
Fine!

27:53.866 --> 27:58.088
Why are you mad at me? I didn't put
holes in the floor, break the furnace.

28:01.352 --> 28:02.693
You're right.

28:04.328 --> 28:05.669
I'm sorry.

28:07.527 --> 28:09.730
I really want to sell this place.

28:10.791 --> 28:13.125
I need to sell this place.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.172
Is it because of Shep?

28:16.101 --> 28:18.751
I mean, does it make you think of him?

28:19.588 --> 28:21.890
God, Mom!
I never even thought of that.

28:25.763 --> 28:29.657
I feel good being on my own.
I just can't afford it.

28:29.923 --> 28:33.916
The house, the car. Somehow I've
accumulated the debt of a 50-year-old.

28:35.138 --> 28:37.342
We should call your Uncle Mykola.

28:38.081 --> 28:39.029
Uncle Myko? Why?

28:39.265 --> 28:42.876
He made all that money in real estate.
He could advise you.

28:44.512 --> 28:46.879
- It's not advice that I need.
- Maybe not.

28:47.104 --> 28:49.242
But spend some time there.

28:49.599 --> 28:51.159
Keep him company.

28:51.391 --> 28:54.358
You know, he has so much money...

28:54.591 --> 28:56.827
...and he has no children of his own.

28:57.086 --> 28:59.419
And, sadly, he has not been
feeling well lately.

29:00.029 --> 29:04.022
Are you suggesting I ingratiate myself
to Uncle Myko so he'll leave me money?

29:04.508 --> 29:06.897
Well, he's going to die.
I can't help that.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.678
I mean, he has no children.
What's the poor man going to do?

29:13.690 --> 29:15.632
This feels like surgery.
It really does.

29:15.866 --> 29:18.615
And I'm floating, floating, floating.

29:18.842 --> 29:21.776
I thought you guys played music.
Although, I don't miss it.

29:22.009 --> 29:23.416
Is this gonna hurt, Dr. Benton?

29:23.641 --> 29:26.510
I've made the incision, Mr. Hartley,
and you didn't feel a thing.

29:26.744 --> 29:28.883
- I mean, in a couple of days.
- It'll be tender.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.283
I mean, like, when I go back to work.

29:31.543 --> 29:33.430
Go back to work
when you feel comfortable.

29:33.687 --> 29:35.727
When will that be?
Are we talking Tuesday...

29:35.959 --> 29:37.868
...Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?

29:38.070 --> 29:39.728
- Another week?
- What do you do?

29:39.958 --> 29:42.925
You know that drawbridge on Michigan?
I send it up.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.618
Send it down.

29:44.853 --> 29:47.155
Send it up, send it down.
Up, down...

29:47.381 --> 29:49.747
...up, down.
Rain, shine, sleet, snow.

29:49.972 --> 29:52.076
Some days I count the boats.
Some days I don't.

29:52.308 --> 29:56.136
By the way, what are the borders
of Hesselbach's triangle?

29:57.554 --> 30:00.042
You might want to shift
a little to the left.

30:00.306 --> 30:02.695
Manny threw up right around there.

30:02.961 --> 30:05.776
- Manny? From the roach-coach?
- Food poisoning?

30:06.033 --> 30:08.782
- I told you.
- It wasn't the coffee, was it?

30:09.008 --> 30:12.488
- Are you ever getting off that?
- I'm on hold with the airlines.

30:12.688 --> 30:16.550
At least that's what the reservations
department has told me 97 times.

30:16.784 --> 30:18.158
Mark, you ready?

30:18.383 --> 30:20.139
Or not, as the case may be.

30:20.367 --> 30:21.861
We'll be waiting.

30:24.717 --> 30:25.665
All right.

30:26.189 --> 30:30.629
- I told Susan about the meeting.
- I told Jeanie, Malik and Carter.

30:31.244 --> 30:34.243
I figured if you don't tell Doug Ross,
then you're okay.

30:42.058 --> 30:43.684
How are you doing, Mr. Heath?

30:43.914 --> 30:45.986
Thomas, where are you?
Your dinner's ready.

30:46.218 --> 30:47.744
I bet those ribs hurt.
Sorry about that.

30:47.977 --> 30:50.279
You hear me? Get inside now.

30:51.305 --> 30:53.192
We'll get you something for the pain.

30:53.416 --> 30:57.376
Listen to me. Listen to me!

30:58.600 --> 31:01.282
I'm listening to you, Mr. Heath.
I'm listening to you.

31:09.093 --> 31:10.337
There he is.

31:10.853 --> 31:13.886
- This is impossible.
- Maybe you should yell "fire."

31:14.565 --> 31:16.899
- No chairs.
- It's a little crowded.

31:17.124 --> 31:19.873
Every buzzard in the county
showed up for this one.

31:20.195 --> 31:21.755
Present company excepted.

31:22.947 --> 31:23.962
Alice Wakely.

31:24.195 --> 31:26.561
She's from Health Services
since the Paleolithic.

31:26.786 --> 31:29.469
- You know her?
- We went to school together.

31:29.697 --> 31:33.145
- She was ahead of me, of course.
- Okay, okay, everybody.

31:33.377 --> 31:35.132
I'll spare you and make this quick.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.589
While we regret the need to close
any county medical facility...

31:38.816 --> 31:40.888
She's lying already.
This isn't quick.

31:41.151 --> 31:44.282
...our strapped budget's made it
unavoidable. Two weeks from today...

31:44.511 --> 31:46.453
...Southside will close its doors.

31:51.230 --> 31:52.342
There's the good news.

31:52.573 --> 31:54.361
We're concerned about
the loss of jobs...

31:54.589 --> 31:57.622
...so we'll consolidate as much
of the staff as possible.

31:58.013 --> 32:01.241
There are people I'll introduce
for those who might not know them.

32:01.692 --> 32:05.368
Harrison Holman is coming over
as new Chief of Obstetrics.

32:07.578 --> 32:10.960
Bonnie Brown will share the CFO office
with James Malkovitch.

32:11.258 --> 32:14.486
I've heard she's excellent.
Did a great job at Deaconess.

32:14.713 --> 32:17.396
And with Mike Babcock
taking early retirement...

32:17.593 --> 32:21.454
...Donald Anspaugh will become
County's new Chief of Staff.

32:58.673 --> 33:01.968
I just was thinking how unusual
it is to see...

33:02.192 --> 33:04.461
...our whole ensemble this happy.

33:04.688 --> 33:08.550
Especially about keeping a job
where people puke on you.

33:08.784 --> 33:10.092
Is that the guy?

33:10.703 --> 33:12.197
- That's the guy.
- Which guy?

33:12.463 --> 33:14.121
He looks fairly normal.

33:14.543 --> 33:16.364
So did Morgenstern.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.235
They finally came down for Heath.
Took him to the CCU.

33:23.756 --> 33:24.585
Poor old guy.

33:24.812 --> 33:26.786
Who do you think Thomas was?
His son?

33:27.020 --> 33:30.281
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think Thomas was his dog.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.068
His dog?

33:32.299 --> 33:35.779
At one point, he seemed to think I was
Thomas. He pulled me in close...

33:36.011 --> 33:37.920
...ear to his mouth, and he whispers:

33:38.154 --> 33:40.161
"Kibble, kibble, kibble, kibble."

33:41.481 --> 33:42.790
It was oddly touching.

33:44.137 --> 33:45.511
It was, Carol!

33:46.280 --> 33:48.102
How are you? Don Anspaugh.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.363
- Lydia Wright.
- Pleased to meet you.

33:51.591 --> 33:53.314
E-Ray. Please join us.

33:53.511 --> 33:56.194
Excuse me. I got it. I got it.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.564
Okay, I'll let everybody know.

34:07.493 --> 34:10.809
That was Dr. Weaver calling
from the lounge.

34:11.043 --> 34:14.206
Dr. Morgenstern will be unable
to attend the party.

34:18.018 --> 34:20.091
I'm sure it won't be as bad
as you think.

34:20.353 --> 34:24.313
Look how bad everybody thought
it would be when I came aboard.

34:25.025 --> 34:26.367
True.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.880
Funny how life is so like surgery.

34:30.784 --> 34:34.396
Sometimes you can make that Rocky
Davis in the right, lower quadrant.

34:34.623 --> 34:37.493
And then there are those days
when your bowel ruptures...

34:37.726 --> 34:40.694
...spills into your peritoneum,
and all you're left with...

34:40.927 --> 34:42.868
...is intense pain and sepsis.

34:44.574 --> 34:46.232
Oh, brother!

34:46.460 --> 34:49.559
My kingdom for a 10-blade
when that happens.

34:56.476 --> 34:58.548
Look, so today's not a total loss...

34:59.291 --> 35:01.745
...you want to grab some dinner,
maybe catch a movie?

35:01.979 --> 35:04.945
The Music Box has some
really fine independents.

35:05.370 --> 35:06.384
Sure.

35:07.929 --> 35:10.133
Maybe a midnight show at the Village.

35:10.361 --> 35:11.473
Have you seen <i>Caligula</i> ?

35:19.959 --> 35:22.228
- Don't do this to me.
- Some of us have to date.

35:24.502 --> 35:25.517
Hi there.

35:30.581 --> 35:33.996
What do you like, Mark,
"The Stars and Stripes Forever"...

35:34.229 --> 35:36.083
...or "Dauntless Battalions"?

35:37.172 --> 35:38.448
Actually, I gotta get going.

35:53.553 --> 35:54.797
Just kidding.

35:57.904 --> 36:00.621
This is torture.
I was off five minutes ago.

36:00.848 --> 36:03.084
My plan was to be in bed by 8:30.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.905
I was saving this guy
for the two of you.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.077
Vomiting, abdominal pain,
nausea. Thanks.

36:07.311 --> 36:10.758
- You been training with Dr. Benton?
- Trust me. You'll thank me.

36:14.349 --> 36:15.810
Thank you, Malik.

36:17.132 --> 36:20.165
Mr. Travels, right?
Mr. Heath's nurse?

36:20.396 --> 36:21.956
I'm Dr. Carter.
This is Nurse Hathaway.

36:22.187 --> 36:25.503
So you're feeling bloated,
nauseous and flatulent.

36:25.771 --> 36:28.836
- Must've been something I ate.
- It could be so many things.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.921
- Toxic megacolon.
- Intestinal parasitosis.

36:31.146 --> 36:32.804
- Scleroderma.
- Ulcerative colitis.

36:33.002 --> 36:34.463
Pyloric stenosis.

36:39.177 --> 36:40.038
Crohn's Disease.

36:40.264 --> 36:43.263
- Where would you like to start?
- I don't want to waste any time.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.121
Barium enema.

36:49.254 --> 36:50.399
I hate it when you do that.

36:50.630 --> 36:53.248
- Come on. It's fun.
- It scared the daylights out of me.

36:53.478 --> 36:56.860
All right, I'm sorry.
It'll never happen again.

36:58.117 --> 36:59.710
Let's go get a drink, you and I.

36:59.972 --> 37:03.038
- Couldn't get anything going tonight?
- Come on. I'm here.

37:03.268 --> 37:04.729
- Thanks.
- Let's get a drink.

37:04.963 --> 37:07.167
It's never just a drink, Doug.

37:08.163 --> 37:10.301
Is that all
that you want it to be?

37:10.531 --> 37:12.919
It'd be nice if you called
the day before.

37:13.154 --> 37:14.681
Heather, you know my schedule.

37:14.914 --> 37:17.980
It's hard enough to plan
two hours ahead, much less a day.

37:18.209 --> 37:20.926
Some really sick little kid
would come in...

37:21.153 --> 37:25.276
...then I'd cancel on you,
and you'd be mad at me for doing that.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.609
I am not mad at you.

37:37.918 --> 37:41.627
You look as though you've had
a very long, very hard day.

37:42.877 --> 37:46.105
And I'd like to take you out
and see you relax a little bit.

37:48.508 --> 37:50.842
I'll throw in a lottery ticket.

37:53.914 --> 37:57.329
I gotta drop these off
at Neurology first.

37:58.138 --> 38:01.204
- Did you actually give him an enema?
- No. Compazine.

38:01.465 --> 38:02.676
Carter went home to bed.

38:02.937 --> 38:05.239
Benton's been beating up on him
these days.

38:05.465 --> 38:07.439
I'm shocked and horrified
to hear that.

38:07.705 --> 38:09.199
Ding-dong. Avon calling.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.222
Please. Allow me.

38:14.263 --> 38:16.467
This is County General on one-alpha.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.182
<i>Unit 85. We're en route</i>
<i>with a 32-year-old male...</i>

38:19.414 --> 38:21.836
<i>... jumped or pushed in front</i>
<i>of an El train at Garfield.</i>

38:22.069 --> 38:24.338
<i>Massive head, face,</i>
<i>chest and extremity trauma.</i>

38:24.565 --> 38:26.769
Garfield's closer to Southside.

38:26.997 --> 38:28.785
<i>They're closed in Trauma.</i>

38:29.940 --> 38:32.907
I came out of the ambulance entrance
and my motorcycle had a flat.

38:33.171 --> 38:36.432
I gave myself plenty of time
to go home and change, but...

38:36.691 --> 38:39.146
I don't care. Really.

38:39.411 --> 38:42.509
- So you live up on the Gold Coast?
- I'm renovating a three-flat.

38:42.706 --> 38:45.520
Must be a lot easier
when you're an architect.

38:46.129 --> 38:47.503
Yes. It probably is.

38:47.729 --> 38:50.892
You know the pitfalls,
how long it's gonna take.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.494
That sort of thing.

38:55.055 --> 38:57.477
I see some friends.
Actually, a friend.

39:01.678 --> 39:03.914
You didn't tell me
you were coming here.

39:04.398 --> 39:06.502
Susan and I work at County together.

39:07.629 --> 39:10.017
- Brent Smythe.
- How do you do?

39:10.285 --> 39:11.529
This is Julie...

39:12.461 --> 39:13.573
Mathers.

39:15.147 --> 39:17.416
- Julie's an architect.
- Oh, really? Where?

39:17.643 --> 39:18.407
Higgin, Bloom.

39:18.635 --> 39:19.747
I represent them.

39:19.979 --> 39:23.808
- You're with Jackson, Gearson and Robe?
- They recruited me out of Stanford.

39:24.042 --> 39:27.336
My brother went to Stanford Law.
He graduated in '85.

39:27.754 --> 39:30.852
Jack Mathers, of course!
He went to... Don't tell me.

39:31.081 --> 39:35.587
- Dudzik, Hiltzik and Strauss.
- You have a good memory, don't you?

39:39.784 --> 39:42.685
Multiple lacerations, including
a chunk of rib cage missing.

39:42.951 --> 39:44.063
BP 60 palp.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.781
One-half liter saline in the field.

39:47.366 --> 39:50.813
He's got obvious open fractures
to the right femur and left humerus.

39:53.765 --> 39:55.423
One, two, three!

39:57.125 --> 39:59.807
- Congratulations on staying open!
- Thanks!

40:00.036 --> 40:02.010
- I'll intubate, 8.0.
- Good radial pulse.

40:02.403 --> 40:05.217
- Poor cap refill.
- Jeanie, give in-line traction.

40:05.826 --> 40:07.648
- BP's down 40 palp.
- Pulse ox 80.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.150
Have Respiratory set up a vent.

40:09.410 --> 40:10.303
No response to pain.

40:10.529 --> 40:13.344
Call Radiology,
get a cross-table C-spine.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.091
I'm in. Hang the O-neg.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.038
Oh, man! Sucking chest wound.

40:18.272 --> 40:19.482
How many units?

40:19.712 --> 40:22.045
Type specific 4,
type and cross 10.

40:23.103 --> 40:24.313
What have we got?

40:24.543 --> 40:27.510
Open chest wound with severe
respiratory compromise.

40:27.742 --> 40:29.084
Intubated but not saturated.

40:29.566 --> 40:30.776
4 units of O-neg are in.

40:31.102 --> 40:32.029
BP's still 40.

40:32.254 --> 40:33.660
We got a pumper!

40:34.973 --> 40:36.860
I've got it.
Power clamp, Kelly.

40:37.084 --> 40:38.262
Okay, Jeanie, you can go now.

40:38.493 --> 40:40.532
- Grab me some Kerlex.
- I've asked her to leave.

40:46.011 --> 40:50.167
Check with the blood bank. Find out
what's keeping that type specific.

40:54.265 --> 40:56.534
How long does it take to get
a couple of drinks?

40:56.761 --> 40:58.801
Hopefully all night.

41:01.273 --> 41:03.247
I guess this is how
perfect couples meet.

41:03.480 --> 41:07.221
- Yeah, on somebody else's blind date.
- Great story for the grandchildren.

41:07.447 --> 41:10.512
You should call Tad
and give him the tip.

41:10.967 --> 41:13.203
Did you think you'd impress her
in scrubs?

41:13.462 --> 41:14.355
You don't think so?

41:14.582 --> 41:16.370
I find it a turn-on,
but some women...

41:16.597 --> 41:18.669
- Are they coming?
- Follow me.

41:24.340 --> 41:26.412
I know! I got some quarters.

41:28.947 --> 41:31.183
I don't remember these things
being so small.

41:31.411 --> 41:34.028
You probably haven't been in one
since you were 12.

41:37.650 --> 41:39.821
- What do we do?
- Look at the camera.

41:40.049 --> 41:41.707
No fair!
You're hogging the frame.

41:41.937 --> 41:43.725
All we'll see is my neck.

41:43.984 --> 41:45.413
- Good one.
- That was a great one.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.363
Just sit there and look.

41:48.592 --> 41:50.795
- Oh, God! Stop.
- They don't give you any warning.

41:51.023 --> 41:52.452
- Okay, it's coming up.
- All right.

41:53.070 --> 41:54.314
- No. Come on.
- Okay.

41:54.671 --> 41:55.598
One good one.

41:56.239 --> 41:57.515
See? That wasn't bad.

42:07.340 --> 42:09.893
Don't you ever treat me
like that again.

42:10.124 --> 42:12.579
- What were you doing?
- Trying to save a man's life.

42:12.812 --> 42:14.186
By giving him AIDS?

42:14.411 --> 42:16.516
I was careful.
I used universal precautions.

42:16.778 --> 42:19.844
You were working on a chest wound.
What if you cut yourself?

42:20.106 --> 42:22.472
- I didn't!
- What if I made a mistake and cut you?

42:22.729 --> 42:24.736
No person's ever gotten it
from contact in an ER.

42:24.937 --> 42:26.147
Does that mean no one can?

42:26.760 --> 42:28.004
Pile up all the data you want.

42:28.232 --> 42:31.428
But you'd better remember what
really happens in this room, okay?

42:33.064 --> 42:34.624
So you would've quit?

42:34.855 --> 42:36.065
In a minute.

42:38.278 --> 42:40.481
But you didn't test positive, did you?
