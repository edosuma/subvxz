<i>(Crickets chirping)</i>

00:10.329 --> 00:12.162
(sighs)

00:13.832 --> 00:18.468
(groaning)

00:25.560 --> 00:27.861
(groaning)

00:31.783 --> 00:34.401
(breathing heavily)

00:38.156 --> 00:40.657
(groans)

00:45.297 --> 00:47.497
(snoring)

00:52.504 --> 00:55.255
- Corporal Eastin.
- Sir.

00:55.307 --> 00:58.558
- What... when did you...
- We arrived two hours ago.

00:58.593 --> 01:00.844
Mr. Woodhull went straight up to bed.

01:00.896 --> 01:02.846
It was a long ride from York City.

01:02.848 --> 01:04.513
You traveled the coast road at night?

01:04.566 --> 01:08.068
I preferred to lodge at Northport
and get home tomorrow,

01:08.103 --> 01:11.154
but your son insisted we get home tonight.

01:11.189 --> 01:14.024
Probably eager to tell me
about his apprenticeship.

01:14.076 --> 01:16.076
How did it go?

01:16.111 --> 01:17.527
I...

01:17.529 --> 01:19.029
No, no, no. That's all right.

01:19.081 --> 01:21.114
I'll talk to him in the morning.

01:22.451 --> 01:23.917
Be needing an escort, sir?

01:23.952 --> 01:26.119
No, just taking a once around.

01:26.171 --> 01:28.204
Get some fresh air.

01:33.378 --> 01:34.711
(Yawns)

01:34.763 --> 01:37.213
The King's Arms on Pearl Street.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.882
Pearl Street.

01:38.884 --> 01:41.351
Several members of the Sons
of Liberty boarded there

01:41.386 --> 01:44.437
at that tavern before the
army took over the city.

01:44.473 --> 01:47.857
I inquired after a man named Hondrick.

01:47.893 --> 01:49.943
Please spell it.

01:49.978 --> 01:52.145
Well, it's not his real name.

01:52.197 --> 01:55.532
In any case, I left word
for him and checked out.

01:55.567 --> 01:58.568
Here is the...

01:58.620 --> 02:00.236
he bill.

02:04.659 --> 02:07.744
You left word?

02:07.746 --> 02:11.631
And you consider this to be a
successful completion of your mission?

02:11.666 --> 02:14.918
Completion? No, no.

02:14.970 --> 02:18.338
Major, this is just the
beginning of several months of...

02:18.390 --> 02:20.974
<i>(footsteps, floorboards creaking)</i>

02:23.345 --> 02:25.261
(clears throat)

02:27.899 --> 02:29.933
(whispering) These traitors
will be well-entrenched.

02:29.985 --> 02:33.186
<i>They couldn't have survived
here this long if they weren't.</i>

02:33.238 --> 02:36.072
I mean, just imagine how
dangerous life would be

02:36.108 --> 02:38.608
for a Patriot spy living inside York City.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.778
So why do you imagine they exist at all?

02:41.830 --> 02:45.949
Because I know the one thing
hese rebels can't resist...

02:45.951 --> 02:48.284
Home.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.254
They were born in New York.
They see it as theirs.

02:52.624 --> 02:55.625
But we can use that against them.

04:03.026 --> 04:04.692

04:04.744 --> 04:06.277
Eat your breakfast. There we go.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.829
I didn't hear you come in last night.

04:07.864 --> 04:10.114
Oh, I was bone-tired.
I didn't want to wake you.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.833
So, tell us, how was the trip?

04:12.869 --> 04:13.951
Abe: <i>Well, it was successful.</i>

04:14.003 --> 04:17.204
I secured an apprenticeship,
was assigned reading.

04:17.207 --> 04:19.040
"Blackstone's Commentaries," actually.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.625
Yeah.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.043
Yeah, it's like Papa's
back in school, isn't it?

04:22.045 --> 04:23.795
Perhaps we can go through
what you've learned.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.047
- I can guide you.
- Well, I have to do it on my own, no?

04:27.384 --> 04:28.850
Take some eggs.

04:28.885 --> 04:31.552
Eggs? I'd love some.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.889
After some fresh air, yeah?

04:35.975 --> 04:37.725
Abe.

04:37.727 --> 04:39.861
Yeah?

04:41.865 --> 04:44.232
I never received your response.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.567
- What?
- To my proposal for you taking over the estate.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.202
Can we talk about this later?

04:48.238 --> 04:49.904
I've reconsidered it.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.376
I have been conservative in my
stewardship of our holdings.

04:55.412 --> 04:58.663
The Royal Army is more creative

04:58.715 --> 05:00.298
in its accrual of assets.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.550
I feel they might take advantage of you.

05:02.585 --> 05:05.136
I think this may be too much responsibility

05:05.171 --> 05:06.637
for your shoulders at this time.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.673
- I understand, yeah.
- Mmm.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.758
- You seem distressed.
- No. No, no, no, no.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.760
What you said makes sense. It does.

05:14.097 --> 05:15.897
Tell me the truth.

05:15.932 --> 05:18.599
The truth, Father, is I've
been bound up since Brooklyn

05:18.601 --> 05:20.601
and I need to take a shit.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.938
So can we talk about this later?

05:37.454 --> 05:39.620
<i>(Horse neighing)</i>

05:54.471 --> 05:56.938
(panting)

05:56.973 --> 05:58.773
See you got my message.

05:58.808 --> 06:00.475
Found it under my tavern door.

06:00.477 --> 06:02.643
Good. I got back last night.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.312
Listen, good news.

06:04.314 --> 06:05.730
I need you to put the signal out for Caleb.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.483
- I did.
- What?

06:08.485 --> 06:10.485
- Two nights ago.
- What for?

06:10.487 --> 06:12.403
Why do you need Caleb?

06:12.455 --> 06:15.122
I thought Mary had an escort
watching your every move.

06:15.158 --> 06:16.824
Well, I, uh...

06:17.994 --> 06:21.546
She... no, wait, wait. Answer me first.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.999
Got this from Abigail.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.552
Sent in secret from Philadelphia.

06:29.506 --> 06:31.589
"General Lee a traitor."

06:33.059 --> 06:35.176
- Charles Lee?
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.929
The man with the fort named after him.

06:37.981 --> 06:41.649
Abigail must have heard or read
something from Major André.

06:41.684 --> 06:43.484
Well, this is...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.855
This is better than what I have.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.524
How do you have anything?

06:49.526 --> 06:52.410
I saw you and Eastin head
off to New York together.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.329
Oh, well, he just accompanied
me to Brooklyn Ferry,

06:55.365 --> 06:57.532
hen I went into the city by myself.

06:57.534 --> 06:59.867
There's something you're not saying,

06:59.919 --> 07:01.536
something you don't want me to know.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.372
No, no, it's just... It's this.

07:04.374 --> 07:08.509
This is a count of men, ships,
and defenses in York City.

07:08.545 --> 07:11.212
- Put this in the drop along with Abigail's note.
- Abe.

07:11.214 --> 07:12.880
No, Tallmadge will need to
read both of these right away.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.432
- Take it. I have to go.
- Abe.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.384
Take it.

07:21.724 --> 07:23.724
I'm using Hewlett to get around Mary.

07:23.726 --> 07:25.476
She thinks I'm in New York studying the law.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.362
- Everyone does.
- Using Hewlett how?

07:30.066 --> 07:33.234
Look, it's a long draw, all right?

07:33.236 --> 07:36.454
I'm pretending to seek out
hidden rebels in New York.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.372
I feed him false names, dead ends.

07:38.408 --> 07:40.541
I get real names and real
numbers for Washington.

07:40.577 --> 07:41.909
That's how it works.

07:41.911 --> 07:45.713
You... you sold yourself as
a spy to an enemy officer?

07:45.748 --> 07:47.465
Yeah, but it's a lie.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.966
It's a draw. I'm using him.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.885
You're...

07:50.920 --> 07:52.803
(scoffs)

07:52.839 --> 07:54.922
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Look, I know what I'm doing.

07:54.924 --> 07:58.225
- Why didn't you tell me?
- When? When do we get to see each other?

07:58.261 --> 08:01.762
Look, I don't have time to tell
you every little thing, all right?

08:14.410 --> 08:16.494
Hey.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.080
I never should have jumped from that boat.

08:19.115 --> 08:20.831
No.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.751
No, no, no. You did the right
hing. This is the proof.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.672
I jumped for you, Abe.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.260
And for the cause, yes,
but for you most of all.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.716
For a life I can't have, I betrayed Selah.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.104
And my comeuppance is to clean up

08:43.139 --> 08:46.307
after men he hated in a
avern he used to own.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.948
If it's too much right now, I understand.

08:53.983 --> 08:55.866
I can find another way to signal Caleb.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.035
Another way?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.071
No.

09:02.659 --> 09:04.875
No.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.995
I made a promise to our friends

09:08.047 --> 09:10.414
and I plan to keep it.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.969
I'll put this in the drop
along with Abigail's.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.009
Our main concern should be Hewlett.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.562
If he finds out you're lying, you're dead.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.933
I'll watch over him while
you're away in the city.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.685
What, on the major?

09:30.687 --> 09:32.186
He offered me his friendship. I'll say yes.

09:32.188 --> 09:34.188
What? When did this happen?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.857
I don't have time to tell
you every little thing.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.612
Washington: <i>Seems our Culper
Ring is alive and well.</i>

09:41.664 --> 09:44.699
Two frigates, the 32-gun Alarm

09:44.701 --> 09:48.786
and 28-gun Sybil moored at Peck's Slip

09:48.838 --> 09:52.590
along with the 18-gun sloop Tobago.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.090
__

09:54.127 --> 09:56.260
"The whole of the king's
roops including outposts

09:56.295 --> 09:59.046
does not exceed 3,500 men."

09:59.048 --> 10:01.132
- Are these numbers precise?
- Approximate.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.300
He had to transcribe from
memory after losing the egg.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.853
Mr. Sackett is working on
better means of encryption.

10:05.888 --> 10:08.639
- The egg?
- It's detailed in the report, sir.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.474
It's wonderfully detailed.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.861
Please tell Mr. Culper I
eagerly await his next report.

10:13.896 --> 10:16.697
And impress upon him that
ime is of the essence.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.899
Yes, sir. And what of
he other intelligence?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.901
It's unclear, inconclusive.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.905
Eight ships anchored in
he lower North River.

10:24.907 --> 10:27.908
I beg your pardon, sir,
but this is clear as day.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.660
"General Lee a traitor."

10:29.712 --> 10:31.579
And this comes direct
from enemy headquarters,

10:31.631 --> 10:33.214
from the house of their
head of intelligence.

10:33.249 --> 10:36.917
No, it comes from a source I
have not heard of before today.

10:36.919 --> 10:40.387
The message is four words
in length, lacks context,

10:40.423 --> 10:43.174
is unverified, and so cannot be trusted.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.477
Sir, the source is the former housemaid
of our signal agent in Setauket.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.763
The spirits of the men are lifted

10:48.815 --> 10:50.431
after our victory at Saratoga.

10:50.433 --> 10:54.769
Now is not the time to
disparage a fellow general.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.937
- (Grunts)
- <i>(pots rattle)</i>

10:56.939 --> 11:00.191
- Oh, calm down.
- Bite that. You get angry.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.943
I lost my entire patrol to Robert Rogers.

11:02.945 --> 11:04.829
<i>My men were butchered in that ambush.</i>

11:04.864 --> 11:06.831
Do you know who we were on
our way to rendezvous with?

11:06.866 --> 11:08.749
Charles Lee.

11:08.785 --> 11:10.701
Caleb: <i>We should have seen it earlier, yeah?</i>

11:10.753 --> 11:12.503
Washington should see it now.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.588
The truth is staring
him straight in the face

11:14.624 --> 11:16.123
and he refuses to even look.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.958
Every hour that Lee remains within our camp,

11:17.960 --> 11:20.344
he more his poison infects this army.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.297
Our dear general may be overly stubborn,

11:23.299 --> 11:26.467
numbingly obsessive, and
downright bullheaded at times,

11:26.469 --> 11:29.270
but he is not, in this case at least, wrong.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.638
Empirically, that is.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.974
I can assure you, Abigail's
intelligence is not wrong.

11:33.976 --> 11:36.277
No, but she is an unverified asset.

11:36.312 --> 11:39.647
Ergo, it falls to us to verify her.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.650
Gentlemen.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.542
Sweet Jesus. What the hell is this place?

11:51.577 --> 11:54.328
We don't have a name for it yet

11:54.380 --> 11:56.831
<i>as Congress is suspicious
of allocating monies</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:58.799
<i>to Secret Services.</i>

11:58.835 --> 12:01.135
And ever since you told me about 355,

12:01.170 --> 12:05.222
I have been working on securing a
new protocol for communications.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.308
35... who is 355?

12:07.343 --> 12:10.311
Abigail, our lady in Philadelphia.

12:10.346 --> 12:13.681
<i>She requires instruction
on how to operate properly.</i>

12:13.683 --> 12:17.518
Her messages lack context.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.486
Worse still,

12:19.522 --> 12:21.238
we don't know when they will arrive

12:21.274 --> 12:24.325
and there's no way for us to message her

12:24.360 --> 12:27.611
until now.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.030
- That's enough.
- Right. Sorry.

12:30.032 --> 12:33.367
Now, there's a hidden compartment insi...

12:33.369 --> 12:35.336
What in the name of God is this?

12:37.206 --> 12:38.706
(Sighs)

12:38.708 --> 12:40.958
Her son is supposed to have carved it.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.378
Her son is nine years old
and he is not Michelangelo!

12:44.430 --> 12:46.964
- Start again.
- Ben: <i> And how long will this take?</i>

12:47.016 --> 12:49.884
Oh, not long. Larsen here
used to carve figureheads

12:49.936 --> 12:51.185
in the Norwegian navy.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.053
I mean to get this to Philadelphia.

12:53.055 --> 12:55.189
It still has to go by way of Setauket first.

12:55.224 --> 12:57.558
Patience, Major. Rome
was not built in a day.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.277
Ben: <i>No, but it was sacked in one.</i>

13:00.313 --> 13:03.280
I need to verify for Washington
hat Lee is a traitor now,

13:03.316 --> 13:05.232
not a month from now.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.618
Don't touch that!

13:07.653 --> 13:10.788
It's very expensive. It's
for special operations only.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.957
- Yeah?
- Yes.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.408
Caleb: <i>I'm very special.</i>

13:14.460 --> 13:16.460
Sackett: <i>You're useful.
Learn the difference.</i>

13:16.495 --> 13:18.579
<i>It's the reason you're here.</i>

13:18.581 --> 13:21.465
Caleb: <i>Ah, right.</i>

13:21.500 --> 13:24.585
<i>This is about that secret mission you
keep jabbering on about, isn't it?</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:27.304
Oh, your head may be empty,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.306
but hers is not.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.509
Now, there's a message
concealed within the waxwork.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.396
Here, practice drill... Take it.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.183
Practice drilling without damaging the bust

13:39.235 --> 13:41.568
<i>until you can retrieve
it in under two minutes.</i>

13:41.604 --> 13:43.187
Is this an order?

13:43.239 --> 13:45.773
It's a challenge.

13:45.775 --> 13:47.491
- Mr. Sackett.
- <i> Hmm?</i>

13:47.526 --> 13:49.193
What... What does this do?

13:49.245 --> 13:52.913
Oh, it's Thomas Jefferson's newest toy.

13:52.949 --> 13:56.583
It allows him to write two
letters at the same time

13:56.619 --> 13:58.619
and to keep a double of his correspondence.

13:58.621 --> 14:02.006
The polygraph duplicator
is what he calls it.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.624
Now, could it...

14:03.676 --> 14:07.294
Could it duplicate something
hat's already been written?

14:07.296 --> 14:09.296
Such as a personal signature?

14:10.299 --> 14:13.517
You wish to forge a letter?

14:13.552 --> 14:15.386
No, to set a trap.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.721
This is not a trap. This is a contraption.

14:17.773 --> 14:21.475
No, but you see, sir,
with the right signature,

14:21.477 --> 14:23.727
it's anyone we say it is.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.981
As far as Lee knows,
it's someone he can trust.

14:26.983 --> 14:29.033
It's a friend.

14:36.859 --> 14:42.388
__

14:46.592 --> 14:48.759
I... I say it is the moon.

14:48.811 --> 14:50.427
(Feminine voice) I know it is the moon.

14:50.479 --> 14:53.347
Then you lie. It is the blessed sun.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.317
(Normal voice) I will never
remember all this.

14:57.353 --> 14:59.319
Calm down, Delancey.

14:59.355 --> 15:02.022
All that it requires is
a little concentration.

15:06.179 --> 15:08.963
Why don't you take a moment to
look through your lines, Captain?

15:10.683 --> 15:12.266
Major André.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.268
Miss Shippen.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.853
What a lovely surprise.

15:15.888 --> 15:17.855
I admired the playbills going up around town

15:17.890 --> 15:19.724
and thought I would drop
by for an early viewing.

15:19.776 --> 15:21.475
Is all of this for the war effort?

15:21.527 --> 15:23.361
General Howe likes to
keep the men entertained.

15:23.396 --> 15:25.363
Theater is a welcome distraction.

15:25.398 --> 15:27.982
Do you prefer Shakespeare's
comedies over his tragedies?

15:28.034 --> 15:32.653
Comedies are a better
onic for soldiers at war.

15:32.705 --> 15:35.906
Tragedy often lurks behind
he facade of comedy.

15:35.958 --> 15:38.409
Isn't the notion of taming
a shrew in itself tragic

15:38.411 --> 15:40.795
when it robs a woman of her
right to sovereign thought?

15:44.167 --> 15:47.218
Mm, such remarkable attention to detail.

15:47.253 --> 15:49.553
As fine a painter as you are a dancer.

15:50.890 --> 15:53.391
Which makes me wonder

15:53.426 --> 15:56.010
why you were so clumsy
he night of my party.

15:56.062 --> 15:58.396
Did I step on your toes?

15:58.431 --> 16:02.516
You inquired about my acquaintance
with Benedict Arnold. Why?

16:02.568 --> 16:05.603
Perhaps we can speak about this
at a more appropriate time.

16:05.655 --> 16:09.740
I will have your answer
now, sir, if it please you.

16:19.001 --> 16:21.619
I had hoped you'd be willing
o write Arnold a letter

16:21.621 --> 16:24.755
recalling your meeting with him
years ago at your family home.

16:26.008 --> 16:27.958
You wish for me to write a rebel general?

16:28.010 --> 16:30.211
All I was going to ask is that you inquire

16:30.263 --> 16:32.797
after the health of a
former guest of your family

16:32.799 --> 16:35.182
recently wounded in battle, nothing more.

16:35.218 --> 16:38.469
A young woman of marrying age

16:38.521 --> 16:41.689
writing to a bachelor and
a traitor to the Crown.

16:41.724 --> 16:43.190
Consider my request withdrawn,

16:43.226 --> 16:45.025
even though I never actually
asked it in the first place

16:45.061 --> 16:48.112
- and not in the way...
- The way in which you had planned?

16:49.982 --> 16:52.116
I'm not a piece on your chessboard, Major.

16:52.151 --> 16:53.701
I never saw you as such, Miss Shippen.

16:53.736 --> 16:55.736
And I regret the implication

16:55.788 --> 16:59.240
both by what it suggests
of my character and yours.

17:01.828 --> 17:03.494
If that constitutes an apology,

17:03.496 --> 17:06.297
hen I suppose I accept it.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.085
Margaret. Miss Shippen, forgive me.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.892
I hope that this misunderstanding
won't prevent you

17:17.926 --> 17:19.393
from coming back and seeing the play.

17:19.429 --> 17:22.346
The entertainment is not just for soldiers.

17:22.397 --> 17:24.732
There's been far too little culture

17:24.767 --> 17:27.852
o enjoy in this city as of late.

17:27.854 --> 17:30.354
If my social diary permits.

17:36.195 --> 17:38.863
(Screaming)

17:42.668 --> 17:45.870
- Shall I stop?
- No. No.

17:45.922 --> 17:48.622
(Screaming)

17:56.382 --> 17:57.765
How bad is it?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.517
Well, the ball is out.

17:59.552 --> 18:03.387
But while I was digging for it, I found
splinters where the bone should be.

18:03.389 --> 18:06.557
You wait any longer, your
blood could be poisoned.

18:06.559 --> 18:08.225
Wait any longer for what?

18:08.227 --> 18:09.860
Amputation.

18:09.896 --> 18:12.446
Take my leg and I take yours.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.400
You should count yourself
lucky, Mr. Thatcher.

18:16.452 --> 18:19.320
The first time General Arnold was wounded,

18:19.372 --> 18:22.072
he kept a sword and two
loaded pistols beside the bed.

18:22.124 --> 18:24.575
Well, apparently I've been tempered.

18:24.577 --> 18:27.328
I should hope not, for our enemy's sake.

18:29.465 --> 18:32.216
<i>I come with news from Congress.</i>

18:32.251 --> 18:35.753
You're to be appointed to major general,

18:35.805 --> 18:38.506
a distinction as well deserved

18:38.558 --> 18:40.724
as it is long overdue.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.310
Why is it they only ever
promote me when I'm wounded?

18:43.346 --> 18:45.429
Well, they realize they could lose you.

18:45.431 --> 18:47.181
It makes them come to their senses.

18:47.233 --> 18:50.985
That's precisely why I feared
it might never happen.

18:51.020 --> 18:55.272
I'd like to see St. Clair's face
when he learns that I outrank him

18:55.274 --> 18:58.409
<i>once again and rightly so.</i>

18:58.444 --> 19:00.361
Doctor, will you excuse us?

19:06.002 --> 19:07.618
(Grunts)

19:12.375 --> 19:14.925
The promotion is in title only.

19:14.961 --> 19:17.044
(Sighs)

19:17.096 --> 19:20.180
You remain subordinate to
hose promoted in February.

19:20.216 --> 19:22.766
You mean to tell me

19:22.802 --> 19:25.636
hat the man who defeated Burgoyne

19:25.688 --> 19:28.522
is outranked by the men
who retreated from him?

19:30.309 --> 19:34.445
Stephen, St. Clair, Mifflin, Lincoln...

19:34.480 --> 19:36.480
I've won more battles than
all of them put together.

19:36.482 --> 19:38.532
Title only.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.701
What about pay?

19:40.736 --> 19:43.821
They are four years delinquent
in reimbursing my expenses.

19:43.873 --> 19:45.990
The Congress is without surplus.

19:46.042 --> 19:48.125
We must all continue to make sacrifices.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.493
Sacrifice?

19:49.545 --> 19:52.580
What do you know of sacrifice?

19:52.632 --> 19:54.298
Remember, George,

19:54.333 --> 19:56.967
my wife did not come from means.

19:58.337 --> 20:01.505
All she left to me were
hree sons to care for,

20:01.557 --> 20:03.974
hree mouths to feed,

20:04.010 --> 20:05.676
hree men to raise strong.

20:05.678 --> 20:09.179
I would rather die before I see shame
brought on them as my father did me.

20:11.734 --> 20:14.018
Something you would understand

20:14.070 --> 20:16.520
if you had any sons of your own.

20:21.911 --> 20:24.528
And who are you fighting now?

20:24.580 --> 20:26.864
I'm fighting for what I deserve.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.534
And I will need your support.

20:30.536 --> 20:34.371
Yes, and it has always been there.

20:34.373 --> 20:36.624
And it will always be.

20:36.676 --> 20:39.009
(Groans)

20:44.550 --> 20:47.685
Ben: <i>Washington is a
weak and feckless leader</i>

20:47.720 --> 20:49.269
blinded by his own arrogance.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.855
Heh, it's too strong.

20:51.891 --> 20:55.192
Well, what about cold and indecisive?

20:55.227 --> 20:58.395
Indecisive, yes, but cold is
a bit too personal a modifier

20:58.447 --> 21:00.064
for Horatio Gates to use.

21:00.116 --> 21:02.199
What, you think I'm
making this too personal?

21:02.234 --> 21:04.451
Me? (laughs) Heavens, no.

21:04.487 --> 21:06.704
I think you're violating the law,

21:06.739 --> 21:09.740
committing treason in a very
considered and rational manner,

21:09.742 --> 21:11.208
as far as I'm concerned,

21:11.243 --> 21:14.378
but what I am curious to
know is are you doing this

21:14.413 --> 21:17.464
o prove yourself right or Washington wrong?

21:17.500 --> 21:19.466
I'm doing this to protect him,

21:19.502 --> 21:21.251
o expose his enemies.

21:21.303 --> 21:22.636
They're the ones committing treason.

21:22.672 --> 21:26.090
I am simply gathering the proof.

21:26.092 --> 21:27.891
Now where is that letter from Gates?

21:27.927 --> 21:29.393
You're forging it right now.

21:29.428 --> 21:31.345
No, not this one, the one to Congress

21:31.397 --> 21:32.930
- with his signature on it.
- Oh.

21:32.932 --> 21:35.399
Where he proclaims his victory at Saratoga.

21:35.434 --> 21:37.985
(Clears throat)

21:38.020 --> 21:41.021
Drill and extract, two minutes. Huh?

21:41.073 --> 21:44.692
Now I haven't gotten head like
hat since before the war, boys.

21:44.744 --> 21:47.244
Here it is. (laughs)

21:47.279 --> 21:49.163
Ben: <i> Good. Now you can help me.</i>

21:49.198 --> 21:50.864
What are we doing?

21:50.916 --> 21:53.450
- Laying a trap for Charles Lee.
- Right.

21:53.502 --> 21:56.086
See, in this letter I pose as General Gates

21:56.122 --> 21:58.622
and I call for Washington to be replaced.

21:58.674 --> 22:01.008
I'll intercept the reply from Lee

22:01.043 --> 22:02.626
and I'll take it straight to the commander.

22:02.628 --> 22:04.128
It will be evidence he can't ignore.

22:04.130 --> 22:05.596
Caleb: <i>That is genius, Tall boy,</i>

22:05.631 --> 22:07.798
<i>but how you gonna get that to Lee's tent?</i>

22:07.800 --> 22:09.800
It'll circulate through
another general's mail.

22:09.802 --> 22:11.852
I've got that handled. What I need you for

22:11.887 --> 22:14.521
<i>is tomorrow to help snatch the reply.</i>

22:14.557 --> 22:16.190
Tomorrow? No. Not good.

22:16.225 --> 22:19.526
I need Mr. Brewster to set
out tonight on his mission.

22:19.562 --> 22:22.396
He's to collect intelligence
from my London contact.

22:22.448 --> 22:24.565
- I am?
- Ben: You have contacts in London?

22:24.617 --> 22:27.651
Don't make too much of it.
It's just parliamentary gossip.

22:27.703 --> 22:30.654
<i>But every little morsel is crucial.</i>

22:30.656 --> 22:32.489
Caleb: <i>I ain't going to London, all right?</i>

22:32.491 --> 22:35.492
(tsk) No, you're going to New Jersey

22:35.494 --> 22:39.663
o the home of a Tory
Loyalist by the name of...

22:40.833 --> 22:44.218
Dr. Charles Hallum, Hackensack Township.

22:44.253 --> 22:46.503
Now, the intelligence is hidden inside

22:46.555 --> 22:48.088
a bust of King George.

22:48.140 --> 22:52.176
You're to extract it without its new
owner knowing it was ever there.

22:53.846 --> 22:56.230
These hands are the silkiest
in the colonies, my friend.

22:56.265 --> 22:59.266
If the messages inside the
waxwork are discovered,

22:59.318 --> 23:01.435
my London contact is dead.

23:03.239 --> 23:05.689
It'll be like I was never there.

23:05.691 --> 23:07.274
Hmm.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.034
Enjoy your stay on New York Island.

23:23.175 --> 23:25.592
Your horse, is he watered?

23:25.628 --> 23:28.095
- Is he rested?
- (neighs)

23:28.130 --> 23:31.014
- Why do you ask?
- I don't have time to stop.

23:31.050 --> 23:32.549
I'm to make a hard ride

23:32.601 --> 23:35.302
straight for the home of Dr. Charles Hallum,

23:35.354 --> 23:37.888
Hackensack Township, New Jersey.

23:37.940 --> 23:40.307
Are you drunk?

23:40.359 --> 23:42.442
(Gurgles)

23:43.779 --> 23:46.313
I haven't touched a drop in weeks.

23:47.783 --> 23:49.900
Easy now, boys.

23:49.952 --> 23:53.654
Unless you care to explain to the king

23:53.706 --> 23:57.241
why you shot his royal messenger.

23:57.243 --> 23:59.910
Stay your firelocks.

24:02.548 --> 24:04.214
Take whatever you need.

24:09.088 --> 24:12.923
Just to avoid any future misunderstandings.

24:18.597 --> 24:21.181
Your king thanks you.

24:32.964 --> 24:34.664
Simcoe: <i>Charge up bayonets.</i>

24:37.053 --> 24:39.804
<i>Shoulder firelocks.</i>

24:39.856 --> 24:42.523
<i>Fix your target.</i>

24:50.533 --> 24:52.617
Eyes up.

24:55.321 --> 24:57.655
Fix your target.

24:57.657 --> 25:01.125
Give him every inch of cold steel.

25:02.879 --> 25:05.880
If I mean to thrust at close
range, then I'll use my pego.

25:05.915 --> 25:08.332
Robert Rogers trained us up in hatchets.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.501
They suit us just fine.

25:10.553 --> 25:14.505
If you'd like to split wood,
by all means use a hatchet.

25:14.507 --> 25:17.174
The bayonet is the finest weapon

25:17.176 --> 25:20.061
for close-quarter killing.

25:20.096 --> 25:22.680
Would anyone like me to demonstrate?

25:26.386 --> 25:28.352
Very well, then.

25:28.388 --> 25:30.555
Continue.

25:43.086 --> 25:44.952
I've made some inquires about you.

25:45.004 --> 25:48.923
I even spoke to Rogers'
Indian before he vanished.

25:48.958 --> 25:50.875
Not only have you taken to the bayonet,

25:50.877 --> 25:53.461
but you're also renowned for
your exotic fighting skill.

25:53.513 --> 25:56.047
Give me a weapon, I'll fight with it.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.099
Correct answer.

26:01.054 --> 26:02.803
Your deed of manumission.

26:06.526 --> 26:07.892
My... my deed?

26:07.944 --> 26:10.361
Freedom papers.

26:10.396 --> 26:12.563
I want you to be free to
make your own decision

26:12.565 --> 26:15.116
when I ask you to be my second-in-command.

26:16.569 --> 26:19.070
Why? What do you get out of this?

26:19.122 --> 26:22.623
You're the only one here that I know
for certain doesn't wish me dead.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.167
- Am I interrupting, sir?
- Not at all.

26:34.587 --> 26:38.306
I was merely informing the Congress

26:38.341 --> 26:41.008
of my resignation.

26:49.102 --> 26:51.185
The officers' dinner.

26:51.237 --> 26:54.689
You offered me your place at the table.

26:54.741 --> 26:57.074
Yes, sir.

26:57.110 --> 27:00.027
Major Benjamin Tallmadge
at your service, sir.

27:00.079 --> 27:02.530
We would have met earlier

27:02.582 --> 27:04.865
had I not disobeyed my orders.

27:04.917 --> 27:07.201
I came here to apologize directly.

27:07.253 --> 27:10.621
General Washington sent
our company to Ridgefield

27:10.673 --> 27:14.375
in support of your campaign, but I
deviated to Setauket on a rescue mission.

27:14.427 --> 27:16.127
And who did you rescue?

27:16.129 --> 27:17.678
My father, sir.

27:17.714 --> 27:19.714
I learned that the Tories
here meant to hang him.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.967
I never would have done that.

27:22.969 --> 27:26.804
But then again, my father
was not worth saving.

27:26.806 --> 27:28.939
(Coughing)

27:37.867 --> 27:41.318
Your dinner, sir. The doctor insists.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.904
(Groans)

27:52.165 --> 27:55.499
Well, I'll leave you to your dinner, sir.

27:55.551 --> 27:58.085
You weren't dismissed, Tallmadge.

28:00.339 --> 28:03.674
I knew your brother Samuel.

28:04.844 --> 28:08.179
<i>He fought for me at Valcour Island.</i>

28:08.231 --> 28:11.682
It pained me to hear of his death.

28:12.902 --> 28:14.902
He was a fine soldier.

28:16.522 --> 28:17.988
Well, thank you, sir.

28:18.024 --> 28:19.857
It means a great deal to
me that you remember him.

28:19.859 --> 28:21.859
I never forget valor.

28:21.911 --> 28:25.162
- There is so little of it in this world.
- Man: <i> Courier here, sir.</i>

28:26.365 --> 28:29.116
<i>Your apology is not accepted, Major,</i>

28:29.168 --> 28:31.502
<i>because you did nothing wrong.</i>

28:34.924 --> 28:38.375
You disobeyed Washington
o save your own father.

28:39.762 --> 28:41.929
<i>We do what is right</i>

28:41.964 --> 28:44.432
and we live with the consequences.

28:50.890 --> 28:53.557
Ah, off to hunt, are we?

28:53.559 --> 28:57.194
Yes, you're welcome to come along.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.146
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not yet ready.

28:59.198 --> 29:01.949
- Soon, though.
- I look forward to it.

29:51.951 --> 29:53.617
It's getting quite brisk out there.

29:53.619 --> 29:56.170
- Do you know where to fetch my gloves?
- No, sir, I don't.

29:56.205 --> 29:59.089
(Sighs) Must I do everything?

30:19.445 --> 30:21.228
Richard.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.980
What the hell are you doing?

30:23.032 --> 30:25.449
How dare you invade my privacy?

30:25.484 --> 30:27.034
- I... I'm sorry.
- Answer me!

30:27.069 --> 30:29.570
I...

30:29.622 --> 30:31.822
I saw you and Abraham
alking the other night.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.742
The two of you talking in secret
on his return from the city

30:34.794 --> 30:38.662
and then pretending like you'd just
seen each other the next morning.

30:38.714 --> 30:41.415
I was concerned that I was being excluded

30:41.467 --> 30:44.718
and alarmed to find I couldn't imagine why.

30:44.754 --> 30:47.137
Oh, Richard, Richard.

30:47.173 --> 30:49.840
This kind of confusion is exactly why

30:49.892 --> 30:51.725
I wanted to tell you about our plan,

30:51.761 --> 30:54.178
- but Abraham begged me not to.
- What plan?

30:54.180 --> 30:58.015
Your son volunteered for an unseemly

30:58.017 --> 31:00.351
but necessary task.

31:00.353 --> 31:03.520
He is working with me to help
root out rebels in New York.

31:03.522 --> 31:04.655
What?

31:04.690 --> 31:06.941
Abraham had a fleeting connection

31:06.993 --> 31:09.076
o a few young men with seditious leanings

31:09.111 --> 31:11.695
from his days at King's College.

31:11.697 --> 31:15.282
His agreeing to contact them
strikes me as penance.

31:15.334 --> 31:17.785
He's deeply ashamed of his association

31:17.837 --> 31:21.121
and he did not want to
disappoint you or worry you.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.623
He's right, I would worry.

31:22.675 --> 31:24.708
Which would put undue pressure on him

31:24.760 --> 31:27.177
at a time which, I'm sure you'll agree,

31:27.213 --> 31:28.929
he needs all his wits about him.

31:33.019 --> 31:35.686
I can see that you are right.

31:35.721 --> 31:38.305
And despite my conduct here,

31:38.357 --> 31:40.224
I would ask a favor of you.

31:40.226 --> 31:42.393
What?

31:44.030 --> 31:46.313
Don't tell him that I know.

31:47.483 --> 31:49.633
Of course.

31:53.527 --> 31:55.744
Who knows not where a
wasp does wear his sting?

31:55.796 --> 31:58.997
- In his tail.
- (feminine voice) In his tongue.

31:58.999 --> 32:00.499
Whose tongue?

32:02.553 --> 32:04.302
(Whispers) Your tongue.

32:04.338 --> 32:06.505
My tongue? Ah, yes.

32:06.557 --> 32:10.308
Delancey: <i>Yours if you talk of tails.</i>

32:10.344 --> 32:12.344
<i>So farewell.</i>

32:12.396 --> 32:14.563
What, with my tongue in your tail?

32:14.598 --> 32:17.733
(Men laughing)

32:18.852 --> 32:21.353
André: <i>Nay, come again, good Kate.</i>

32:21.355 --> 32:24.573
- I am a gentleman.
- (men laughing)

32:25.943 --> 32:28.160
Half the men could not remember their lines

32:28.195 --> 32:30.078
and the rest could only recall verses

32:30.114 --> 32:32.114
hat should not be spoken
in delicate company.

32:32.166 --> 32:35.283
I've heard worse from the gentlemen
who have shared our table.

32:35.335 --> 32:36.585
You say.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.087
They're novices, Father,
not trained professionals.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.039
Would you rather have players defending us?

32:41.091 --> 32:43.258
Man: <i>Judge Shippen.</i>

32:53.470 --> 32:56.855
I'm happy your social diary
could accommodate the show.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.974
It's worth the trouble if only to see

32:59.026 --> 33:00.892
he kind of woman you're drawn to.

33:00.894 --> 33:03.228
(Both laugh)

33:04.782 --> 33:06.898
As for my tongue,

33:06.950 --> 33:10.035
I fear it carried too strong
a sting when last we spoke.

33:10.070 --> 33:12.070
You had every right to be waspish.

33:12.072 --> 33:14.206
My presumption deserved a rebuke.

33:14.241 --> 33:17.959
At the peril of repeating the same mistake,

33:17.995 --> 33:21.046
should I dare to inquire if we
might see each other again?

33:21.081 --> 33:24.082
If your social diary permits, of course.

33:25.502 --> 33:28.470
Margaret, it's time.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.261
Oh, Major.

33:36.313 --> 33:38.980
I was able to send that
letter for you after all.

33:43.437 --> 33:44.769
What letter?

33:44.822 --> 33:47.439
Peggy: <i>Oh, to the Benedicts,
a family in Lancaster</i>

33:47.491 --> 33:49.491
<i>with whom he wished to become acquainted.</i>

33:49.526 --> 33:51.743
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

33:52.699 --> 33:57.924
__

34:11.465 --> 34:14.632
(moaning)

34:14.685 --> 34:17.802
(laughing)

34:48.085 --> 34:50.385
<i>(dog growls)</i>

34:50.420 --> 34:51.920
<i>(dog barking)</i>

34:51.972 --> 34:54.139
<i>(woman laughing)</i>

35:05.602 --> 35:07.552
Where's King George, you little shite?

35:07.554 --> 35:09.554
- (Barks)
- Pork for you.

35:17.731 --> 35:21.316
(Pounding on door)

35:21.368 --> 35:23.368
Hallum: <i>Do you know the hour?</i>

35:23.403 --> 35:26.070
- <i>(pounding)</i>
- What in God's name...?

35:27.240 --> 35:30.575
- Dr. Charles Hallum?
- Uh...

35:30.627 --> 35:32.076
Sorry to interrupt,

35:32.129 --> 35:35.380
but you have something I need.

35:35.415 --> 35:37.048
What is this about?

35:37.083 --> 35:39.250
A shipment.

35:39.252 --> 35:40.802
A bust of the king

35:40.837 --> 35:43.922
commissioned from a Miss
Patience Wright in London.

35:43.974 --> 35:47.342
But I don't have it. I... I never did.

35:47.394 --> 35:48.760
Oh?

35:48.762 --> 35:51.596
Well, this receipt says

35:51.598 --> 35:54.599
hat you should have
received it three weeks ago

35:54.601 --> 35:56.568
from the vessel Margaretta.

35:56.603 --> 35:59.604
On my honor, sir, the package
never made it to my home.

35:59.656 --> 36:03.074
<i>The Margaretta was ransacked by privateers.</i>

36:03.109 --> 36:04.442
Oh?

36:04.444 --> 36:06.110
Yes.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.862
There was a letter from
he shipping company.

36:07.914 --> 36:10.198
Go and get it.

36:11.334 --> 36:13.501
<i>Don't take your time.</i>

36:16.623 --> 36:18.623
(barks)

36:20.126 --> 36:22.126
Oh, hello.

36:22.179 --> 36:24.179
Hello. Come on.

36:24.214 --> 36:25.964
- (laughs)
- (barking)

36:25.966 --> 36:28.800
Eh, come to me. Come to daddy.

36:28.852 --> 36:32.554
Hey, come here, you stupid dog.

36:46.152 --> 36:48.570
It was seized two weeks ago
in the Long Island Sound.

36:48.622 --> 36:52.407
The rebel ship Revenge approached under
false flag and proceeded to board it.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.492
Oh, Ryder.

36:54.544 --> 36:56.160
No, Revenge.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.162
No, Ryder is their captain.

36:58.215 --> 37:00.465
<i>I know all the crews</i>

37:00.500 --> 37:02.967
all the way along Devil's Belt,

37:03.003 --> 37:04.802
Tory and Patriot alike.

37:04.838 --> 37:07.005
Rough waters.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.340
But you mark my words,

37:09.342 --> 37:12.227
revenge will be mine.

37:12.262 --> 37:14.479
Huh?

37:18.401 --> 37:21.236
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:37.301 --> 37:38.256
(Clears throat)

37:39.144 --> 37:42.178
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness. How clumsy of me.

37:42.230 --> 37:44.180
Here, let me help you, here.

37:44.232 --> 37:46.015
Sackett: <i>Here we are. Up we go.</i>

37:46.017 --> 37:47.767
- Thank you, sir.
- Steady. You all right?

37:47.819 --> 37:50.069
Yeah? Good.

37:50.105 --> 37:51.688
- There you are, lad.
- Thank you. Good.

37:51.690 --> 37:54.240
Here you are, son. Carry on.

37:59.531 --> 38:01.698
Ben: <i>"Washington will not go.</i>

38:01.750 --> 38:04.284
<i>He must be pushed.</i>

38:04.336 --> 38:07.921
If the Congress will not
rid us of this demigod,

38:07.956 --> 38:10.590
I pray a higher power will intervene."

38:10.625 --> 38:12.258
(scoffs)

38:12.294 --> 38:14.344
I have heard enough.

38:16.882 --> 38:19.883
Well, I wanted you to see

38:19.935 --> 38:22.685
General Lee's nature with your own eyes.

38:22.721 --> 38:26.189
That part about a higher power
sounds like he's calling for your death.

38:26.224 --> 38:28.858
- It is damning.
- I agree.

38:28.894 --> 38:32.478
And I think more than sufficient
o relieve Lee of his command.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.731
I wasn't referring to the general.

38:37.068 --> 38:38.902
How did you obtain this?

38:40.822 --> 38:42.121
I...

38:43.875 --> 38:47.377
I forged a letter from Gates
o prompt his response.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.212
So his reply was coerced.

38:49.247 --> 38:51.714
You entrapped him through falsehood

38:51.750 --> 38:54.584
and created two documents
which if discovered

38:54.636 --> 38:56.502
may shame this army.

38:56.554 --> 38:58.922
No, no, sir. The letter I wrote as Gates

38:58.924 --> 39:01.257
contained a request to
be burned upon reading.

39:01.259 --> 39:03.810
<i>Lee's letter contains the same request.</i>

39:03.845 --> 39:05.428
This evidence is for your eyes only.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.182
I wanted you to witness his
reachery firsthand in ink.

39:09.234 --> 39:11.100
So that I may do what, precisely?

39:12.687 --> 39:13.987
So that I may do what?

39:14.022 --> 39:16.439
This man has been working
o undermine you for...

39:16.491 --> 39:18.992
Since the day I was appointed.

39:19.027 --> 39:22.946
And Gates and Conway and others.

39:22.998 --> 39:24.831
Would you have me court-martial them?

39:24.866 --> 39:26.616
Hang them? Stone them to death?

39:26.668 --> 39:29.502
- Sir, I...
- What would you have me do?

39:29.537 --> 39:31.454
I would have you defend yourself.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.456
I am not in danger.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.876
America and her future depend on this army.

39:36.928 --> 39:38.211
If we fight ourselves,

39:38.263 --> 39:41.014
we will appear to be
divided and disorganized.

39:41.049 --> 39:43.216
We are divided, sir. We are greatly divided.

39:43.268 --> 39:45.935
And the French cannot know it!

39:52.978 --> 39:55.945
For the head of intelligence,
you have so little understanding

39:55.981 --> 39:58.364
of what is truly at stake.

39:59.985 --> 40:01.117
The French?

40:01.152 --> 40:04.737
Only France has the arms

40:04.789 --> 40:07.490
and munitions and ships needed

40:07.492 --> 40:10.410
o defeat Howe's army
and liberate our cities.

40:10.462 --> 40:14.330
<i>Without France, we have
no chance to succeed.</i>

40:14.332 --> 40:16.382
<i>Versailles is watching,</i>

40:16.418 --> 40:20.253
waiting to see if we are a worthy ally.

40:20.305 --> 40:24.223
Exposing treachery in our highest ranks

40:24.259 --> 40:27.226
proves that we are not.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.482
Sir, I...

40:32.517 --> 40:34.400
I was only trying to protect you.

40:34.436 --> 40:39.322
It is better to offer no
excuse than a bad one.

40:41.943 --> 40:44.660
Forgive me, sir. I did not know.

40:44.696 --> 40:47.780
And it is not my task

40:47.832 --> 40:49.699
o teach you better sense.

40:51.703 --> 40:54.704
I'm not your father

40:54.756 --> 40:57.006
and you are not my son.

41:25.987 --> 41:27.820
- (laughing)
- Look at you!

41:27.872 --> 41:29.572
- Look at you!
- (giggling)

41:29.624 --> 41:32.158
- Growing bigger all the time.
- Oh, careful.

41:32.210 --> 41:33.793
Who's this? Is that Mama?

41:33.828 --> 41:35.711
- Can you say Mama? Mama.
- Mary: <i> Mama.</i>

41:35.747 --> 41:37.246
- That's Mama's nose.
- <i> Remember?</i>

41:37.298 --> 41:39.082
Someone's tired, I think, huh?

41:39.134 --> 41:40.550
- Aw, time for bed?
- Are you tired?

41:40.585 --> 41:43.252
- Time for bed. Come on.
- (kissing)

41:43.304 --> 41:45.054
Okay, go.

41:45.090 --> 41:47.507
- Say good night, Papa.
- Good night.
