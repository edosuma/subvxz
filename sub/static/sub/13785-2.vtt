01:43.812 --> 01:45.646
Man:
I am not the fine man

01:45.814 --> 01:47.732
you take me for.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.901
No no.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.968
I come in April
to sell a string of horses

02:16.136 --> 02:18.846
and try my luck in the streams.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.433
What I got for the stock

02:22.601 --> 02:24.936
I lost at the wheel,

02:25.103 --> 02:27.438
and the flake I washed up

02:27.606 --> 02:30.900
I drank the fuck away.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.111
I don't know
as I'll get home at all.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.781
I sold my boots.

02:36.949 --> 02:40.076
I owe $9 to a whore.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.412
(wood creaks)

02:43.580 --> 02:46.582
- (bone cracks)
- (dog barking distantly)

03:03.934 --> 03:05.935
(grunts)

03:22.369 --> 03:27.456
- It looks like he fell off the platform.
- It's just a broke-necked hoople, Al.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.377
That he posed us no threat was a judgment
you come to even as you fuckin' snored?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.839
Turns on watch, Johnny, until this
goddamn Hearst business settles out.

03:35.007 --> 03:40.344
And not that we lack options--
like the sleep from which none awaken.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.848
Would you close your flap,
that I don't forego my boiled eggs?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.751
Do you believe the speeches
will be delivered tonight?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.586
The speeches...

04:13.754 --> 04:18.048
the elections are hostage
to the business of the camp,

04:18.216 --> 04:20.343
which is bloody...

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
murderous.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.768
And, you know...

04:29.895 --> 04:31.729
I don't like this tea.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.773
- Too cool?
- It's too weak.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.609
I do not make weak tea.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.236
I oughtn't to tease.
(chuckles)

04:43.742 --> 04:45.409
I like mine unusually strong.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.870
You might have said, Seth.
It's an easy thing to fix.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.914
- You're right.
- I'm not a mind reader.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.583
- I've said it now.
- My goodness.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.377
(teacup clinks)

05:11.687 --> 05:13.980
How am I?

05:14.147 --> 05:17.024
I could wish your symptoms
further remitted.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.151
I find your answer vague.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.488
Doctor, has your medicine
dulled my faculties

05:22.656 --> 05:25.116
or do you wish
to cloud your meaning?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.368
You don't do as well as I'd hoped.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.789
Am I now losing my baby?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.834
My opinion is you will.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.086
And your symptoms make it

05:37.254 --> 05:39.505
prudent to intervene.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.508
You're pained at the stomach.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.385
I'd-- I'd laid that to--

05:44.553 --> 05:46.846
to your medicine
slowing my digestion.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.516
The spasm in the muscles of your belly

05:50.684 --> 05:53.686
doesn't owe to slowed digestion.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.688
And while you are bleeding less,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.441
that you bleed at all
with pain at the abdomen

05:58.608 --> 06:00.985
argues against further delay.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.656
Have I time to see
to certain arrangements?

06:05.824 --> 06:09.410
May I begin to see to mine?

06:12.873 --> 06:17.668
(Doc wheezes, coughs)

06:22.049 --> 06:25.384
I should be back in about...

06:25.552 --> 06:27.553
an hour and a half's time.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.358
Put your school things
together, little one.

06:51.578 --> 06:55.581
If we know Hearst is coming, boss,
why the fuck don't we strike first?

06:55.749 --> 07:00.961
From the moment we leave the forest, Dan,
it's all a giving up and adjusting.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.881
Across the thoroughfare
to see to that cocksucker's throat.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.886
We forgo the rock for the dagger,
learn distraction's use and deceptions

07:09.054 --> 07:11.263
before the dagger is employed--

07:11.431 --> 07:14.558
spirits, women, games of chance.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.770
I'm older and I'm much less
friendly to fuckin' change.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.189
Change ain't lookin' for friends.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.691
Change calls the tune we dance to.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.822
Al:
Where are you going?

07:31.743 --> 07:33.953
Whiskey, Captain?

07:47.384 --> 07:50.427
- Morning, Miss Sunshine.
- Morning, Cy.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.975
What can you tell a man
at the margin of things--

07:56.143 --> 07:59.061
the reason for these
canceled speeches?

07:59.229 --> 08:02.398
I don't know why
they was canceled.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.484
You seem a little sour.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.697
Don't think lying here these weeks,

08:09.865 --> 08:11.866
I ain't had my dark moments.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.453
Thank God I took
this book up again.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.707
If it really brings
you peace, then I'm glad.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.126
Hell, yes, it brings me peace.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.128
Do you doubt that?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.672
I try to believe.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.841
You want to read some
with me, honey?

08:30.802 --> 08:34.179
"Same as you want to find a different way,
then why couldn't Cy?"

08:34.347 --> 08:38.558
Getting gut-stabbed by a minister of God
will bring you to examine your path.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.020
But I don't.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.569
I had a gun to my ear
at Shaunessy's yesterday.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.197
What the hell
were you doing at Shaunessy's?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.699
Staying away from here.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.868
You listen to me, young lady.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.372
What brings a gun to the temple

09:00.540 --> 09:04.668
is lack of gainful occupation
and of being useful to others!

09:05.670 --> 09:08.380
I don't see you try
to kill yourself here.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.008
All you do here is good
for the girls and me too.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.469
I don't want to run women no more.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.930
And that's turning from your gift

09:16.097 --> 09:17.890
and your training!

09:18.058 --> 09:21.936
When you speak, I feel like
it's the devil talking.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.233
Ain't that a lovely thing
to hear yourself accused of?

09:28.735 --> 09:30.361
(knocks, door opens)

09:30.528 --> 09:33.405
Con: Excuse me, Mr. T,
but fucking Lila's in extremis.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.826
Jesus Christ!

09:38.912 --> 09:41.247
Ought I get the doc?
Leon seems over his head.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.043
(Cy groans)
She'll see to it.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.254
Yeah.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.091
(panting)

09:52.259 --> 09:55.803
Try to stay afloat
from the fuckin' sickbed,

09:55.971 --> 09:58.389
have to listen to something like that.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.101
(crying)

10:03.478 --> 10:06.522
Get the fuck inside, Leon,
before I take out my gun and kill you!

10:06.690 --> 10:09.900
- Joanie, this ain't the way it looks.
- Get inside or get shot!

10:10.068 --> 10:12.945
Well, hold her up then!
Got a long fuckin' way to fall down.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.989
Let me die, Joanie.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.032
Start walking, you lousy whore.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.910
Start walking.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.509
Slept inside,
in case you wasn't aware.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.304
Miss Stubbs' request.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.182
Thought she'd try
someone competent keeping watch.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.189
She's off to the Bella Union.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.191
I can't worry about her right now.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.153
Can you just help me
lug in the fucking water?

10:54.321 --> 10:58.073
I'm, for the day, off the bottle
and about to bathe.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.369
Camp get up a petition?

11:19.471 --> 11:21.513
I can sniff this all you want, boss,

11:21.681 --> 11:25.851
but I-- I ain't got one fuckin' scintilla
of an idea what these marks mean.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.480
What if that's the door of our joint?

11:32.275 --> 11:33.984
That would make

11:34.152 --> 11:37.363
this line the bar.

11:37.530 --> 11:42.117
- Adams: What would that make the Xs?
- Murderers.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.456
- See to your task with the Jew.
- (sighs)

11:58.968 --> 12:01.303
(sighs)

12:01.471 --> 12:04.390
A few fuckin' things history proves:

12:04.557 --> 12:06.392
you sit still,

12:06.559 --> 12:09.812
you fuckin' memorize,
you repeat back what you fuckin' learn,

12:09.979 --> 12:13.107
or, choosing otherwise,
you display your knuckles

12:13.274 --> 12:15.943
to be struck fuckin' bloody
on the fuckin' desk!

12:17.862 --> 12:21.573
(clears throat) That how you gonna
start your talk to the children?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.909
Shut the fuck up, Mose!

12:24.077 --> 12:26.703
And don't tease me
at a crucial fuckin' hour.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.168
Can I listen?

12:38.091 --> 12:41.927
From outside
at your post near the shitter.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.023
Could you have
been born, Richardson,

12:55.191 --> 12:58.360
and not egg-hatched
as I've always assumed?

12:58.528 --> 13:01.280
Did your mother hover over you,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.699
snaggle-toothed and doting,

13:03.867 --> 13:06.076
as you now hover over me?

13:06.244 --> 13:08.245
I loved my mother.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.790
Puberty may bring you
to understand

13:11.958 --> 13:14.001
what we take for mother love

13:14.169 --> 13:18.255
is really murderous hatred
and a desire for revenge.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.966
Will you give your speech
to be mayor tonight?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.013
Whatever night I give it,
count on me not to mince words.

13:28.183 --> 13:32.394
"Electors of the camp,
as to who should serve as mayor,

13:32.562 --> 13:34.730
reasonable men may differ.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.648
But as to who should be sheriff...

13:37.984 --> 13:41.445
we all ought speak with one voice.
And our words should be,

13:41.613 --> 13:45.657
'Turn out the maniac Bullock,
who set upon the mayor unprovoked,

13:45.825 --> 13:49.244
who beat him
with merciless protraction.'

13:49.412 --> 13:51.663
Bullock should be murdered!

13:51.831 --> 13:55.375
We should rise up
and murder Bullock!

13:55.543 --> 13:57.461
Thank you very much."

13:57.629 --> 14:00.297
My father didn't liked me.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.096
I'd like to use your ointment
to suffocate you.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.248
May the little one walk with you?
Is that all right?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.958
Of course.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.589
My mother's sick.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.435
We're closed
for the next 15 minutes.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.523
(grunting)

15:00.525 --> 15:03.235
- Whiskey.
- Beer.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.951
(clears throat)

15:11.119 --> 15:13.745
I'm concerned it might be
taken as provocation...

15:13.913 --> 15:16.540
me serving his whiskey
before you getting your beer,

15:16.708 --> 15:20.252
- or the very reversal of that.
- Just bring the whiskey.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.337
Fuckin' beer.

15:24.549 --> 15:28.176
And these others, they friends of yours,
that come in on your heels?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.178
You friends of these boys, fellas?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.892
Should I be taking
your orders all together?

15:38.855 --> 15:42.190
- Was yours the fuckin' beer?
- Mine was the fuckin' whiskey.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.234
(sighs)
Right then.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.777
Right you fuckin' are.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.196
(screams, groans)

15:48.364 --> 15:49.781
- (grunts)
- (gun blasts)

15:49.949 --> 15:53.368
- Make a move, cocksuckers!
- Don't you shoot 'em, Johnny!

15:56.831 --> 16:01.501
If these fellas had been sent here to draw,
I believe they'd have already done it.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.754
Go ahead.
Go on, fellas.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.131
Mind the muck
at the thoroughfare center.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.258
Debates are on for tonight,

16:08.426 --> 16:10.093
whoever you might want to tell.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.144
I'll drink after I've ate.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.481
(thuds)

16:24.025 --> 16:26.902
Nuh-uh, no no. You don't want--
you don't want to go in there.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.540
Definitely a prudent investment.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.671
If I could control even one my vices,
believe me, I'd have kept the house myself.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.176
Excuse me.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.432
(spits)

16:57.600 --> 16:59.184
Oh, no.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.520
That's what these are for.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.108
Whether I ever fucking
live there or not.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.656
My husband and I agreed
before marrying

17:12.824 --> 17:16.034
that property held by either of us
before our union

17:16.202 --> 17:18.453
would not be encumbered
by our marriage.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.165
As to such properties held...

17:23.334 --> 17:25.001
by me...

17:25.169 --> 17:28.588
(sighs)
I name my ward Sofia inheritor.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.801
(whispers)
I've heard her.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.470
I wish no amendment

17:35.638 --> 17:37.889
as to guardianship

17:38.057 --> 17:40.058
or administration
of those properties.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.895
(moans weakly, panting)

17:44.063 --> 17:46.231
I've heard her.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.652
Oughtn't Mr. Bullock
be present to accept?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.867
This is property before our marriage.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.578
I know what it is.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.749
Don't he need to accept,

18:03.916 --> 18:07.252
being steward now
to Sofia's interests?

18:07.420 --> 18:10.130
Why don't I go fetch him?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.685
We have a special guest
with us today--

18:23.853 --> 18:25.937
Miss Jane Cannary.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.900
An Indian scout!

18:30.067 --> 18:31.651
There's a child I know.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.321
Sofia.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.453
Anyways, uh...

18:42.538 --> 18:44.831
I was a scout for Armstrong Custer.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.000
- George.
- You're right,

18:47.168 --> 18:51.171
but I always called him
"General" to his face,

18:51.339 --> 18:53.298
and "Armstrong" behind his back.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.092
- Why?
- Martha: James.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.137
I guess I...

18:59.305 --> 19:02.015
I always spoke of him
as "Armstrong"

19:02.183 --> 19:04.100
'cause he seemed puffed up to me,

19:04.268 --> 19:07.103
and "Armstrong"
has a puffed up sound.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.147
(giggling)

19:12.485 --> 19:14.986
Any quarrel with me
continuing, James?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.780
James: Go ahead.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.035
Uh-oh.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.163
Why say "Uh-oh"?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.333
If you don't mean
to go on to explain yourself,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.418
why say anything at all?!

19:31.546 --> 19:36.132
Do you only feign stupidity while in fact
plotting ways to madden me?!

19:36.300 --> 19:39.886
- No.
- Why did you say it?

19:40.054 --> 19:42.347
Why did you say "Uh-oh"?!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.641
It's the sheriff that beat you.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.351
(sighs)

19:46.519 --> 19:48.019
Now comes Mr. Hearst.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.526
Gentlemen.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.612
(pans clattering)

20:09.834 --> 20:12.210
Two of his men throat-cut,

20:12.378 --> 20:14.713
he picks the fuckin' fish.

20:18.175 --> 20:21.094
Why do you think the men were his?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.019
My wife would like to see you.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.366
Kinda warm.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.412
The man didn't listen--

20:47.580 --> 20:50.290
his basic fundamental problem.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.043
He'd look at hisself in the mirror
when you'd make your report.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.171
- Once I said how thin his waist was...
- (laughing)

20:56.339 --> 20:59.591
...and how pretty I found his hair,
just to get him to turn around,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.594
which he did-- to tell me
get out of his tent.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.930
So...

21:06.641 --> 21:09.059
I guess my lesson
I got to teach you--

21:10.186 --> 21:13.438
listen and you won't get scalped.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.443
And don't look at yourself
too much in the mirror.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.320
What else I found puffy--

21:20.488 --> 21:23.406
he traveled with a dozen
caged animals

21:23.574 --> 21:25.533
like you'd see
in some zoo in the East.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.287
Like we don't have enough
wild animals around here, huh?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.081
(chuckles)

21:32.416 --> 21:34.834
Let us all thank Jane

21:35.002 --> 21:36.836
for her bravery here today.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.506
Thank you, Jane.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.092
I know another
brave person here too.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.887
Several.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.642
Doc: More.
More more more more. Uh-huh.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.019
More more.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.606
All right.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.441
Wider.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.610
Not you!

22:00.778 --> 22:03.363
- (sighs)
- All right.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.116
All right.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.664
Sofia must be protected.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.291
If my first husband's family

22:15.459 --> 22:17.627
attacks Sofia's title in court,

22:17.795 --> 22:20.714
Mr. Hearst might be
approached as a purchaser.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.801
I'm sure he could buy
the relevant authorities.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.302
All right.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.888
Given his history with Hearst,

22:29.056 --> 22:31.850
I'd spare Mr. Ellsworth that indignity.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.894
I understand.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.482
Thank you, Mr. Bullock.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.530
(sighs)

22:47.283 --> 22:49.534
I regret nothing.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.498
(whispering)
I bought the house.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.418
The house. I bought it.

23:41.670 --> 23:45.006
It doesn't mean we have
to move in together.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.597
Please remind Sofia

23:52.765 --> 23:56.893
- that the full moon is in two days.
- All right.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.609
We three will watch it together.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.867
(clenched) Davey is taking a chance
not letting Al do the scrubbing.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.911
That's Davey's fucking problem.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.582
(grunts)
All right.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.752
(groans)

24:29.426 --> 24:31.636
(sighs)
All right.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.350
Now Hearst...

24:37.518 --> 24:40.645
sent these two,
the two you had the drop on--

24:40.813 --> 24:42.313
That didn't draw.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.315
Yeah, he sent the two
that didn't draw,

24:44.483 --> 24:46.985
so that these two wouldn't
be so quick to their irons.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.987
And these two that
you and Al murdered--

24:50.739 --> 24:53.032
Correct.
These-- these two.

24:53.200 --> 24:57.036
See, that give me and Al time
to cut their throats.

24:57.204 --> 25:01.249
Now that was Hearst
showing Al his ass.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.753
And sending this diagram ahead

25:05.921 --> 25:08.840
was him signaling Al his intention?

25:09.008 --> 25:12.302
Well, it was his preliminary signaling
that he was gonna show his ass,

25:12.469 --> 25:14.846
if Al was smart enough to know it.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.016
Now otherwise,
if Al didn't know it was coming,

25:18.184 --> 25:21.644
he'd have been surprised when
those two didn't back these two's play.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.148
Well, thinking that Al would
throw his hands up surprised

25:25.316 --> 25:27.817
shows that Hearst ain't too smart!

25:27.985 --> 25:30.486
(laughs)
Aw, he's smart, Johnny.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.406
I mean, they're both,
him and Al, real fuckin' smart.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.158
(loud flatulence)

25:38.537 --> 25:41.372
- (groans)
- That'd knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.635
I just-- I feel shunted aside or the like,
not involved as much as previous.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.637
Adams, you were busy with Star.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.347
That you sent me off to see.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.141
Thinking you'd be back
before time for the murders.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.769
So it wasn't like a decision
you made to have the murders

26:02.937 --> 26:04.520
while I was signing the papers?

26:04.688 --> 26:07.440
You've no idea how fuckin' badly
you're boring me.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.150
- (knocks on door)
- Yeah?

26:11.528 --> 26:14.447
That captain's brought over
another envelope.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.497
Won't you see with me
what this might portend?

26:23.499 --> 26:25.208
All right.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.173
Drink?
Or won't you be staying?

26:37.471 --> 26:40.598
Ask the fella who made them Xs

26:40.766 --> 26:43.351
if he hires out for portraits.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.367
What's Al doing?

26:59.535 --> 27:01.619
Like I fuckin' know.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.956
If it was trailing water,
we might get took for ducklings.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.168
(pounding)

27:16.385 --> 27:19.345
"Come watch
the speeches with me

27:19.513 --> 27:21.806
on--"

27:21.974 --> 27:23.683
It's written in awkward hand.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.769
"Come watch the speeches
with me on my veranda."

27:26.937 --> 27:29.314
Adams: That's what it says.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.442
What in God's name is going on?

27:32.609 --> 27:35.278
And I inquire about
more than that hole.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.659
These last months have made me expert.
It was gunfire

27:41.827 --> 27:44.704
- and it came from your saloon.
- Has not the press a duty, Merrick,

27:44.872 --> 27:47.540
qualifying its accounts in time of war?

27:47.708 --> 27:50.168
Are we at war now here in the camp?

27:50.336 --> 27:53.338
Has that fact been
suppressed as well?

27:53.505 --> 27:56.257
Absent formal declaration, Al,

27:56.425 --> 28:00.845
information which affects this community
is not my prerogative to disseminate;

28:01.013 --> 28:03.264
to do so is my sacred responsibility.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.933
Whores currently disseminating
a dose, for example?

28:06.101 --> 28:09.937
To inform within decency's limits.
We've had this discussion before.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.358
Citizens better die pustulating
than touch indecent ink.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.485
Make a list of the infected whores

28:15.652 --> 28:18.821
and account for this morning's gunfire,
and I'll publish it all.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.032
I won't, fucking Merrick,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.368
because neither's
to my fucking interests,

28:23.535 --> 28:27.538
just as you owning a print press
proves only you've an interest in the truth.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.874
Meaning up to a fucking point.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.877
Slightly more than us others maybe,

28:33.045 --> 28:36.631
but short of a fucking anointing
or the shouldering of a sacred burden,

28:36.799 --> 28:39.217
unless of course the print press
was gift of an angel.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.969
And I'd want to be there
for that handoff myself.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.808
Maybe you should print an extra
saying the speeches are on again.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.060
Tonight?

28:49.228 --> 28:52.063
What time do you think
would be best?

28:54.191 --> 28:57.819
If people tried keeping
their thoughts to theirselves...

29:02.032 --> 29:03.616
Yes, sir?

29:03.784 --> 29:06.744
Will you mind, Charlie, not being
noted tonight from the hustings?

29:06.912 --> 29:10.248
- Be a godsend.
- Mrs. Ellsworth isn't well.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.210
I'm sorry.

29:19.550 --> 29:22.760
If, while I'm on that goddamn platform,

29:22.928 --> 29:25.388
you could station outside her place...

29:25.556 --> 29:27.765
Sure I could.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.768
Sol's speaking too,
you see, or I'd ask him.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.564
Glad to do it, Bullock.
Glad and fuckin' relieved.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.281
Doc Cochran seeing to her?

29:45.159 --> 29:46.868
In good hands then.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.620
And Mrs. Bullock sees to Sofia.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.751
Don't that child thrive now,
with starting into school?

30:00.215 --> 30:03.551
Sweet as before,
notably more outgoing.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.776
Trixie will come out
from being in helping the Doc.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.571
Likely to come out for a smoke.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.876
Fuckin' mail, huh?

30:42.382 --> 30:45.927
(panting)

30:47.304 --> 30:51.140
Uncharted territory, Harry.
Coming up on 14 minutes.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.643
I don't care.
I don't care whatever you mean.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.853
Readied as you were yesterday

30:56.021 --> 30:58.272
only to have the event deferred,

30:58.440 --> 31:01.067
do you suppose it's nerves

31:01.235 --> 31:03.694
about giving your speech
has your bowels in upheaval?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.239
When you was a boy, Rutherford,
I bet you was a hand

31:06.406 --> 31:09.659
at tying cans to dogs' tails
and setting cats ablaze.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.954
Or uncertainty when they'll be held?

31:13.121 --> 31:16.290
(groans)

31:18.502 --> 31:21.337
Overturning turtles was my specialty.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.051
Wake up, Lila.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.928
- Wake up.
- (sighs)

31:29.096 --> 31:31.347
Don't you close your eyes again.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.984
(moans softly)
How do you make it through?

31:44.778 --> 31:47.363
Go on, girl. Get out.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.037
(door opens, closes)

31:57.958 --> 31:59.500
(grunts softly)

32:00.502 --> 32:02.336
Trixie:
Seven times through, Alma,

32:02.504 --> 32:04.755
I'm healthy as a fuckin' horse.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.428
I trust you not
to modify my instructions.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.763
To the letter, Doc.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.599
All right, begin.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.316
- (groaning)
- Doc: You'll be all right.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.653
You'll be all right.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.073
All right.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.540
Doc: Turn your head away
from the cloth and breathe.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.376
Shut the fuck up and concentrate.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.297
Turn your head away, God damn it!

32:46.465 --> 32:49.550
Trixie: What I'm used to,
this is like smelling fucking posies!

32:49.718 --> 32:53.471
Doc: I would just soon
that you not fucking pass out!

32:53.639 --> 32:57.141
When you're done with hers, Doc,
why don't you fucking kiss mine?!

33:05.776 --> 33:07.943
(chattering)

33:16.787 --> 33:19.580
I'll be back in just a moment, Sofia.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.791
Round the dough's ends.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.012
Mrs. Ellsworth is being seen to
by Dr. Cochran.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.768
And Trixie, I believe, is assisting him.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.610
I'll keep care of Sofia
while you deliver your speech.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.951
And we'll both pray
for Mrs. Ellsworth.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.674
Go on then.

34:11.842 --> 34:15.428
Spend time finding spine
to put the bullet in your brain.

34:15.594 --> 34:18.389
(piano playing distantly)

34:21.643 --> 34:23.853
Calls me the fucking devil.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.275
Show me another fucking strategy...

34:32.070 --> 34:34.780
bedridden and liable
to fucking slaughter.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.456
Deception don't preclude the search

34:44.623 --> 34:46.583
for fucking conviction.

34:48.128 --> 34:52.380
- When is "when"?
- You are a fucking stitch.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.884
"About to begin"--
it could mean anything.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.970
There's a crowd outside.
Are the speeches about to begin?

34:58.138 --> 34:59.930
Is "when" now?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.224
- Oh, dear. Oh, brother.
- What is it?

35:02.392 --> 35:04.894
Only Andy Cramed,
you drug-addled turd!

35:05.061 --> 35:06.604
- Gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.898
(laughs)
Yes, sirree. Reverend!

35:10.025 --> 35:12.067
Excuse me for just a moment.
Reverend!

35:12.235 --> 35:14.278
Reverend!

35:14.446 --> 35:17.364
Guess you heard about
the clergical discount

35:17.532 --> 35:20.367
on wheel and faro both.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.623
Yes, Con?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.583
Andy Cramed that stabbed you--

35:27.751 --> 35:29.627
he's outside with Leon, sir.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.629
- Is he?
- Yes, sir. Just come in.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.800
Is his blade sheathed?

35:35.967 --> 35:38.677
No brandishin', no threatenin'
gestures of any kind.

35:38.845 --> 35:42.556
- I'll see him, Con.
- Yes, sir.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.625
(shivering)

36:12.963 --> 36:14.463
Reverend Cramed.

36:14.631 --> 36:18.050
- Or are you an apparition?
- It's me, Cy.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.803
Ain't that what a spirit would say?

36:21.847 --> 36:25.808
It's Andy Cramed in the flesh.
How are you, Cy?

36:26.852 --> 36:28.519
Well I'd say, overall.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.314
(coughs, shivers)
Though I'll never shit again without pain.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.149
I'm sorry.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.777
Now you ain't come to finish me off?

36:36.945 --> 36:39.113
To ask your forgiveness.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.116
Then decide how to vote?

36:42.284 --> 36:45.035
Coming for the speeches
was my excuse.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.789
As far as stabbing me, Reverend,

36:48.957 --> 36:52.167
you was sorely fuckin' provoked.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.003
I denied you'd been called,

36:54.170 --> 36:58.591
treated you like the shitbag
fuckin' operator you used to be.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.176
I forgive you, Cy,

37:01.344 --> 37:03.512
as I come to beg your forgiveness.

37:05.015 --> 37:08.100
The ribbon's at Matthew 12, Reverend.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.396
Could you read verse 31 for me?

37:20.864 --> 37:24.533
"Therefore I say to you,
every sin and blasphemy

37:24.701 --> 37:26.535
will be forgiven

37:26.703 --> 37:30.706
except blasphemy against the spirit."

37:32.751 --> 37:35.711
Couldn't Matthew
be speaking of me there?

37:36.922 --> 37:41.216
Oh, Christ Al-fuckin'-mighty,
I'm so glad to fuckin' see you, Andy,

37:41.384 --> 37:44.720
with-- with forgiveness
in your fuckin' heart.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.516
(trembling) Oh... where is this strength
coming from now?

37:49.684 --> 37:52.561
Where is this strength coming from

37:52.729 --> 37:54.730
that I feel flowing into me,

37:54.898 --> 37:57.858
that lets me sit up and try
to fuckin' touch you, Andy,

37:58.026 --> 38:00.152
if only you'll fuckin' let me?

38:00.320 --> 38:04.114
Fuck me!
Fuckin' Jesus Christ Almighty!

38:04.282 --> 38:07.076
Can you feel what's
fuckin' moving here?

38:07.243 --> 38:09.078
It's moving in the room right now!

38:10.288 --> 38:13.707
If only you'd hold me,
I believe I could walk--

38:18.213 --> 38:21.340
Con said now may be
when you asked to be told about.

38:21.508 --> 38:24.426
Jesus Christ, you're well-arrived.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.972
Would you have dope's cross
off your shoulders, son?

38:29.015 --> 38:30.849
I know I'd--
(coughs)

38:31.017 --> 38:32.434
like to take less.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.895
Then fall to your fuckin' knees.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.690
Get to your motherfuckin' knees, Leon,

38:37.857 --> 38:41.360
and ask the Lord to lift
your burden part-way.

38:41.528 --> 38:44.780
Hear me! Lord!

38:44.948 --> 38:47.700
Don't fuck with
the fuckin' deity, Leon!

38:47.867 --> 38:49.785
You've got to come
to Him wholehearted,

38:49.953 --> 38:52.538
even when you're asking
for partial relief.

38:54.124 --> 38:58.085
O Lord! Let Leon cut down, Lord,

38:58.253 --> 39:00.546
on the motherfuckin' dujie.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.756
Let him cut way the fuck back.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.092
I'll speak to you another time.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.805
Oh!

39:09.973 --> 39:12.850
Do you hear how I'm coming
at him for you, Leon?

39:13.018 --> 39:16.395
How I fully fuckin'
supplicate the motherfucker?

39:16.563 --> 39:18.731
Speeches are near
commensurating, sir.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.983
Now that's a definite.

39:21.151 --> 39:24.153
(piano continues playing)

39:24.320 --> 39:26.864
Get the fuck up, Leon.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.159
Help Con get me ready.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.579
Any argument for us accompanying
you over there, boss?

39:33.747 --> 39:37.291
Don't strike the right note
going over there with seconds.

39:37.459 --> 39:40.711
Dan: You know goddamn well Hearst
is gonna have his second there,

39:40.879 --> 39:44.173
that sea-creature-looking cocksucker.

39:44.340 --> 39:48.385
Hearst would have it understood the captain
is just a hefty steward of the household.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.096
Yeah, one with a dozen
fuckin' pelts on his belt.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.057
Even so, Dan,

39:53.224 --> 39:55.601
Hearst's man has pretext
for his presence.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.187
You and the others don't,

39:58.354 --> 40:02.024
what with the olive branch
I'll be bearing between my teeth.

40:02.192 --> 40:05.110
- Mind if we watch you from the balcony?
- Not at all.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.654
Moment seems meet,
blow me a kiss.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.616
Excuse me.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.412
(door opens, closes)

40:17.123 --> 40:19.875
If I could, I'd tear my skin off.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.588
If I could, I'd put out my eyes.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.383
- Now now.
- I hate being sick.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.763
Cy knew what I was.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.183
He knew to pick me
all those years back.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.062
Miss Stubbs, did you like
my friend Bill Hickok?

40:40.230 --> 40:42.773
Oh, I--

40:42.941 --> 40:45.150
I just met him the once at the Bella,

40:45.318 --> 40:47.152
at poker with Jack McCall.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.905
Did you like Bill that night?

40:54.327 --> 40:56.662
I thought he was a gentleman.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.622
He was.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.666
I felt he had a good soul.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.793
He did, Miss Stubbs.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.630
I can say that
that knew him 20 years.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.632
You know what else?

41:08.800 --> 41:11.218
Bill that we both liked so well,

41:11.386 --> 41:13.303
and most everyone did
that knew him

41:13.471 --> 41:15.597
including some he killed--

41:17.267 --> 41:20.811
Bill thought as ill of his own self
as you seem to do about you.

41:20.979 --> 41:24.398
So go on and try
explaining people to me.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.943
And same as hearing me say
what Bill thought of hisself

41:28.111 --> 41:31.029
I don't expect brings you
to think any less of him...

41:32.157 --> 41:33.991
maybe you, Miss Stubbs,

41:34.159 --> 41:37.119
oughtn't to stand judge and jury

41:37.287 --> 41:40.247
and every other job in court
on your own personal case.

41:40.415 --> 41:44.710
Maybe coming to verdict,
credit others' opinion of you

41:44.878 --> 41:47.588
like you do
what you think of Bill...

41:48.590 --> 41:50.215
still.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.478
AW: So I'm gonna-- I'm gonna just
do some introductory remarks.

42:03.646 --> 42:07.232
I'll call you up on stage,
say what you have to say and that's it.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.984
Aw, shit.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.448
Mr. Hearst.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.783
Do you come to me placated,
Mr. Swearengen?

42:16.951 --> 42:18.785
Never more so,
not even as a tiny tot.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.787
Let's hear the speeches together.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.789
Show me your hole in the wall,

42:22.957 --> 42:24.917
which I find a useful advance.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.339
De Tocqueville said,

42:30.506 --> 42:32.966
"When an opinion has
taken root in a democracy

42:33.134 --> 42:35.719
and established itself
in the mind of the majority,

42:35.887 --> 42:38.722
it thereafter persists by itself."

42:38.890 --> 42:41.350
Tonight let us plant

42:41.517 --> 42:44.102
the seed of an opinion

42:44.270 --> 42:46.855
to take root and grow deep,

42:47.023 --> 42:49.191
that gathering to this end

42:49.359 --> 42:54.154
choosing those who will act
in our name is proper,

42:54.322 --> 42:56.156
so that in years to come

42:56.324 --> 42:59.576
among those who succeed us
in this thoroughfare

42:59.744 --> 43:01.870
this idea will persist

43:02.038 --> 43:04.206
and seem to them self-evident.

43:05.708 --> 43:09.127
Candidates for mayor:
EB Farnum and Sol Star.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.463
The incumbent
will address us first.

43:15.551 --> 43:16.885
(grunts)
Oh God.

43:19.973 --> 43:23.558
- I give no long speech tonight.
- (applauding)

43:23.726 --> 43:26.228
You know me and my works.

43:26.396 --> 43:29.690
Your bosom must swell
with pride, Mr. Swearengen.

43:29.857 --> 43:33.360
Swellings and saggings to the tit
I lay at the exactions of time.

43:33.528 --> 43:35.529
(chuckles)

43:35.697 --> 43:39.241
I mean you worked
to bring this evening about.

43:39.409 --> 43:41.243
Labor without pleasure

43:41.411 --> 43:44.162
makes us our destiny's slaves.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.456
To work for crumbs
or to keep from the lash

43:46.624 --> 43:48.792
says maybe a slave's what you are.

43:50.211 --> 43:54.589
I'll not question those either
who have faith in my rival,

43:54.757 --> 43:57.592
or make faith an issue of any sort.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.053
(whistles)

44:00.221 --> 44:03.348
We are long past
the time of the pharaohs.

44:03.516 --> 44:06.101
I cannot decree
Mr. Star make exodus.

44:06.269 --> 44:08.854
Were you whipped, Mr. Swearengen?

44:10.398 --> 44:13.108
And does the lash snap still?

44:13.276 --> 44:16.611
Do you wait for the strike
after all these years?

44:16.779 --> 44:20.324
Would the grip have been
the part you were versed with?

44:20.491 --> 44:23.118
I was born
to neither power nor money.

44:23.286 --> 44:27.664
My father sold goods
from a countryside crossroads hut.

44:27.832 --> 44:30.334
A clear choice for Deadwood!

44:31.836 --> 44:35.589
Farnum-- twice measured;
Star-- once cut.

44:38.259 --> 44:39.885
EB Farnum!

44:41.012 --> 44:43.597
Assayed and proven true!

44:46.059 --> 44:49.269
Farnum!
Christ knows he's earned it!

44:49.437 --> 44:51.521
(groans)

44:51.689 --> 44:53.774
- (light applause)
- Thank you.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.484
Mr. Star!

44:55.651 --> 44:58.904
(applauding)

44:59.072 --> 45:01.281
When last we spoke

45:01.449 --> 45:03.450
you warranted your willingness

45:03.618 --> 45:05.869
to interfere with me.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.039
Only to convey that my place
should be for my uses.

45:09.207 --> 45:11.958
I won't need a miracle
far as parting the creek

45:12.126 --> 45:14.044
to take my leave of the camp.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.798
I just bought a house and plan
to live here as long as God gives me.

45:17.965 --> 45:21.802
And my intention in making
my sacrifice to you today--

45:21.969 --> 45:25.347
and it seems,
my life's great challenge--

45:25.515 --> 45:28.600
was to show the virtue
of consolidating purposes.

45:28.768 --> 45:30.852
Keep people from
shitting in the creek!

45:31.020 --> 45:33.605
- (crowd agrees)
- That and siftings runoff,

45:33.773 --> 45:35.482
tailings accumulating...

45:35.650 --> 45:38.735
I'd say that's naming
horseshit virtue.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.113
Purposes butt up against each other

45:41.280 --> 45:44.491
and the strong call "consolidating"

45:44.659 --> 45:47.285
bending the weak to their will.

45:49.414 --> 45:53.583
And I'd add that whoever's behind me
is about to study his guts.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.252
That's Captain Turner

45:55.420 --> 45:56.837
at three steps' remove.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.715
He has heard about
your knifework close in.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.010
Man: No lowered pants
in the Whitewood!

46:04.178 --> 46:06.179
That's enough about
the shit in the creek.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.223
Away from your seconds' view,

46:08.391 --> 46:10.851
the captain's pistol
is trained at your head.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.770
Do you believe yourself
enough an adept,

46:13.938 --> 46:16.940
Mr. Swearengen,
to overcome your disadvantage

46:17.108 --> 46:19.734
or you will you walk with us inside?

46:21.195 --> 46:23.447
Hmm.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.866
Not throwing my hands up
or my skirt over my head

46:26.033 --> 46:28.994
- don't mean I ain't awestruck.
- (laughs)

46:29.162 --> 46:32.456
They ain't slobbering on each other,
but they ain't snarling neither.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.833
Star: Needs to do
with the camp, or problems,

46:35.001 --> 46:37.169
you can always find me
at the hardware store.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.882
(crowd chattering, applauding)

46:46.596 --> 46:48.346
Seth Bullock for sheriff!

46:59.150 --> 47:01.318
I agree with what Mr. Star says.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.112
I find I usually do.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.948
I'm lucky we've been
partnered these years.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.326
It keeps giving me time to catch up.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.453
I'm glad he's standing for office,

47:11.621 --> 47:14.206
and I'd try to be as good a sheriff...

47:15.666 --> 47:17.417
as he'd be a mayor to the camp.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.795
Seth's voice:
Sol's buying a house.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.673
I built one last year.

47:26.552 --> 47:30.055
I'm glad we're in the camp...

47:32.266 --> 47:34.935
even on the sorriest of days.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.024
(applauding)

47:42.193 --> 47:44.152
Harry Manning for sheriff.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.292
Accepting your premise,
Mr. Swearengen,

47:59.460 --> 48:03.505
I'll not name how you would benefit
from the action I wish you to take,

48:03.673 --> 48:07.634
saying only instead it's my will--
to which I will have you bend.

48:07.802 --> 48:10.011
I suggest you drink that.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.347
No.

48:12.515 --> 48:16.560
I would incorporate into my holdings
the claim now owned by Mrs. Ellsworth.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.979
I am told that you can
help me bring this about.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.022
(grunting)

48:24.485 --> 48:26.528
Tell me how you will help.

48:27.530 --> 48:30.240
This is a grip I'm used to.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.701
(gagging)

48:37.039 --> 48:39.332
Well, as far as making
your way into her...

48:40.710 --> 48:43.378
act averse to nasty language

48:43.546 --> 48:46.214
and partial to fruity tea.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.219
(grunts, gasps)

48:53.723 --> 48:55.140
(wheezing grunt)

48:55.308 --> 48:57.100
(thuds)

48:57.268 --> 48:59.477
But I'd like to get known

48:59.645 --> 49:01.187
far as wanting to help the camp.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.189
(harmonica playing)

49:03.357 --> 49:04.941
We need a fire brigade,

49:05.109 --> 49:08.069
and I'd like to lead it.

49:09.405 --> 49:12.198
I've always loved fires
since-- since I was a boy.

49:13.576 --> 49:15.952
If you're wanting drink,
the No. 10's serving.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.580
(clears throat)
Oh, also--

49:18.748 --> 49:22.083
also, the graveyard needs moving.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.085
That's it.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.631
- (scattered applause)
- Well, thank you all for coming.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.050
Please think about
what you heard here tonight,

49:30.217 --> 49:31.760
and thank you again.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.970
(AW groans)

49:46.609 --> 49:48.777
Nothing's over yet.

50:04.794 --> 50:07.170
Doc would be dour at a christening,

50:07.338 --> 50:11.132
but Trixie says he wasn't
scowling how he does,

50:11.300 --> 50:14.135
or shaking his jowls like a bulldog.

50:16.472 --> 50:18.556
- Thank you, Charlie.
- All right.

50:22.395 --> 50:25.772
Oh God. That's the look he gets
on his face when he's fuckin' hurt.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.608
That man appears
worse hurt than I am.

50:28.776 --> 50:30.902
Bless his heart.

50:31.070 --> 50:32.529
Seth: What happened?

50:32.697 --> 50:35.407
We watched the speeches together.
Yours was especially swell.

50:35.574 --> 50:38.368
(quietly) I need to lean on you,
but don't you fuckin' look up.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.495
- Should I go up and get him?
- Hey, boys!

50:42.206 --> 50:43.832
What'd you think
of the speeches, huh?

50:43.999 --> 50:46.876
- I'll go get the cocksucker now.
- Stay the fuck away from him.

50:47.044 --> 50:49.212
I'm having mine served cold.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.423
First one to touch me I kill.
