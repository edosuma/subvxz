<i>[Betty] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.702 --> 00:05.466
- How bad is it between them?
- It's like Cain and Abel.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.698
Cut it out!

00:06.773 --> 00:09.207
- Time to get practical.
- I'll handle this.

00:09.275 --> 00:12.335
Whether you like it or not,
he asked me to pick him up.

00:12.412 --> 00:16.906
Last night a friend from home showed up.
My ex-girlfriend.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.117
- Wow.
- Where do we stand?

00:20.186 --> 00:23.644
Maybe it wouldn't kill us
to try and work together.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.816
You do believe I'm innocent,
don't you?

00:25.892 --> 00:26.881
I want to.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.394
I know who killed Fey Sommers.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.092
It was me.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.830
Betty.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.872
Betty... you're snoring.

00:47.914 --> 00:50.348
- Mrs. Meade?
- I killed her, Betty.

00:50.417 --> 00:55.252
I killed Fey Sommers and
I'll kill you too if you tell anyone,

00:55.321 --> 00:56.549
especially Daniel.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.785
Now, where do you keep the vermouth?

01:01.327 --> 01:02.589
[Gasp]

01:10.336 --> 01:11.701
[Henry] Hey, Betty.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.567
- Henry!
- Cute headgear.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.003
Have you met my girlfriend?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.243
[Sexy music playing]

01:29.656 --> 01:31.419
It's nice to meet you.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.284
It's too bad it didn't
work out between us.

01:36.729 --> 01:39.163
Claire Meade's going to kill you anyway.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.797
[Clock ticking]

01:46.706 --> 01:47.764
[Moans]

01:49.275 --> 01:51.368
It's gonna be a long night.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:00.186 --> 02:02.814
- Alexis, please...
- You're my brother, Danny,

02:02.889 --> 02:05.255
I'll call you whatever I want.
Fine.

02:05.325 --> 02:08.157
Well, will you be at
the ad sales meeting at 10:00?

02:08.228 --> 02:11.095
Might be awkward if we're
both sitting at the table.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.859
Daniel, we're both in charge.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.265
It's going to be awkward
if you still shove grapes up your nose.

02:16.336 --> 02:19.703
I did manage to get three up there once,
though, didn't I?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.669
Hold on, your collar's going crazy.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.970
Thank you.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.515
- Good morning, Betty.
- Good morning.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.622
Right, Stella McCartney's
having that party tonight.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.556
I got plans with Becks,
you want my invite?

02:39.626 --> 02:41.355
Yeah, sure. Maybe.

02:41.427 --> 02:44.692
Maybe? Last week I gave you
a calendar from my bank

02:44.764 --> 02:47.232
and you were all like,
"Shut up! I can have this?"

02:47.300 --> 02:48.733
This is Stella McCartney.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.598
Daniel, I need to talk to you.

02:50.670 --> 02:54.572
OK, let me, um, call Chloe
from Prada first. OK?

02:55.408 --> 02:57.069
Your mother killed Fey Sommers!

02:58.444 --> 02:59.843
Um...

03:01.581 --> 03:03.811
You don't need to sign for this.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.715
They were being so nice to each other.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.453
Maybe Daddy told them
if they didn't play nice,

03:14.527 --> 03:16.961
he'd take away their private planes.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.759
They were smiling.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.800
Stop fondling my limes
and do something!

03:21.868 --> 03:25.235
And breathe in happy air.
[Deep exhale]

03:25.305 --> 03:29.332
Let me put out a gay-P-B among the
assistants and find out what's going on.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.870
[Christina] You rang?

03:37.483 --> 03:39.007
Do you want something hemmed?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.645
You're not here to stitch.
You're here to snitch.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.882
She needs information, bitch.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.822
I thought we were rhyming.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.591
What exactly do you want from me?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.324
Has your friend Betty
told you exactly

03:52.398 --> 03:55.094
what's going on
between Daniel and Alexis?

03:55.168 --> 03:57.159
- How do you mean?
- Don't be a cluck.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.331
The cold front between the Meade boys
has clearly thawed.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.169
Who turned up the heat?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.210
OK, here's the skinny.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.440
Word is, Alexis's calendar is empty.

04:07.513 --> 04:10.107
Nobody's returning calls,
no lunches, nothing.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.175
It looks like she's reaching out
to her brother

04:13.253 --> 04:15.687
because she's friendless.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.519
Really?

04:18.124 --> 04:21.423
Hmm... this might mean an "in" for me.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.754
What are we thinking?

04:24.831 --> 04:29.234
So I'm not a part of the "we,"
so unless you need my sewing skills,

04:29.302 --> 04:31.202
then I'm just gonna leave.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.667
That one's gonna be trouble.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.766
You make sure that pasty seamstress
stays on our side.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.744
Become her best friend.
Be her new Betty.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.837
I guess I have to start eating potatoes.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.347
[Groans]

04:44.484 --> 04:47.749
Betty, my mother tends to be
a bit delusional when she drinks.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.550
- She said she cut her brakes.
- After a few cocktails,

04:50.623 --> 04:54.753
she's also claimed she's won the Boston
Marathon... and caused the tsunami.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.490
She followed her in her Aston Martin
and watched her crash into a tree.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.271
Call Rikers.
Tell them I need to see my father.

05:10.610 --> 05:14.774
Your mother did not kill Fey. What are
you listening to that assistant for?

05:14.914 --> 05:17.075
Why would Mother confess to that?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.846
Here's a surprise, Daniel.
She's a drunk.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.911
Now, she may have her demons,
but she's not a murderer.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.321
Why don't you focus
on something important,

05:25.391 --> 05:27.052
like finding me a new lawyer.

05:27.527 --> 05:30.360
I need someone better.
I need "The Chin."

05:30.430 --> 05:31.863
- The who?
- The Chin.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.798
You want to help me, get me Grace Chin.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.736
Grace Chin?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.069
[Becks] You dated that?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.131
No, actually I stood that up.

05:43.209 --> 05:46.372
Good call. Not enough beer in
the world to make that look good.

05:46.446 --> 05:50.314
She was my T.A., I promised
if she helped me pass criminology,

05:50.383 --> 05:53.147
that I'd take her to
the Sigma Phi New Year's kegger.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.119
That's so man-whore of you.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.851
Yeah, except that was the night
Cindy Howard showed up at my room

05:58.925 --> 06:02.224
and decided being a virgin
wasn't cool anymore.

06:02.295 --> 06:06.664
That's interesting because she decided
that two weeks earlier in my room.

06:08.501 --> 06:12.369
Becks, Grace Chin will never
take my father's case.

06:12.438 --> 06:16.135
- Not after what I did to her.
- That was last century.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.576
Look at this fatty. She's probably
got three or four chins by now.

06:19.979 --> 06:23.107
Give her a call.
She'll be happy to hear from a man.

06:29.188 --> 06:31.452
- What are you doing tonight?
- I have no idea,

06:31.524 --> 06:33.253
but it involves a load of alcohol.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.853
Perfect. Daniel gave me his invitation
to the Stella McCartney party

06:36.929 --> 06:38.760
and you are going to be my plus one.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.023
- It says VIP
- I know!

06:41.100 --> 06:44.467
I've never even been an "I.P."
Look at the lettering. It's so rich.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.529
You're feeling up a piece of paper.
You need to get out more.

06:47.607 --> 06:51.839
I do. I need to do something to get
my mind off Henry's slutty girlfriend.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.971
- You met her?
- No, but you know she is.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.605
[Telephone ringing]

06:57.683 --> 07:00.311
Hello, Christina McKinney.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.377
Yes, very good. Who is this, really?

07:04.023 --> 07:05.047
Really?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.449
[Stammering]

07:07.794 --> 07:09.022
Absolutely.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.699
I'm on hold for Sarah Jessica Parker.
What do I do?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.233
- You're doing it.
- I can't!

07:15.301 --> 07:18.668
- You talk to celebrities all the time!
- I know, but not ones I like!

07:18.838 --> 07:19.964
[Nervous gasps]

07:21.240 --> 07:23.765
[Exaggerated accent]
Hallo, this is Christina.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.970
I'm Scottish, not an Australian hooker.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.809
- You saw my work at the Fashion Week?
- [Gasping]

07:28.881 --> 07:31.782
Of course I can create an Oscar dress.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.248
When do you need it?
Tomorrow?

07:34.320 --> 07:36.288
Crikey! Um...

07:37.156 --> 07:38.453
She'll do it!

07:38.524 --> 07:40.424
I'll do it. G'day, mate.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.591
Oh, Betty, what the hell?
I can't whip up a dress in a night.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.394
[Scottish accent]
It's got to be done by tomorrow.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.463
She's leaving for L.A. You're one of
the "Top Ten Designers to Watch!"

07:51.537 --> 07:54.631
No! But it's Sarah Jessica Parker!
It's the Oscars!

07:54.707 --> 07:57.642
It's the chance of a lifetime.
Get psyched!

07:57.710 --> 07:59.200
Oh, I can't. Yes, I can.

07:59.278 --> 08:03.112
I can. Silk sheath... low back...

08:04.183 --> 08:07.209
Don't worry about tonight.
I will find another plus one.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.878
...cut on the bias...

08:10.156 --> 08:11.817
Good luck!

08:14.460 --> 08:17.554
What? $14.00 for
a brownie and a sandwich?

08:17.630 --> 08:20.224
They keep prices high
to discourage eating.

08:22.201 --> 08:25.227
I'm sorry, I'm two dollars short.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.272
What if I just took part of the brownie?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.831
No. Don't worry about it. I got it.

08:29.909 --> 08:33.902
That's so sweet. I've been in this city
two days, the kindest thing said is,

08:33.980 --> 08:35.948
"Your ass could make
a nice chunk of change."

08:36.015 --> 08:40.782
That is just New York's way of saying
"Welcome, you look good in your jeans."

08:40.852 --> 08:43.822
Charlotte, by the way.
Everybody calls me Charlie.

08:45.057 --> 08:48.652
- You have an amazing aura.
- [Cashier] Come on, ladies!

08:50.029 --> 08:52.759
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

08:52.832 --> 08:54.925
You haven't even started beauty school.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.663
Cosmetology Institute, please.

08:57.737 --> 09:01.138
And if I'm gonna get a leg up,
I have to practice.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.540
Come on, Papi. You said you
would help me if I gave you a beer.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.840
- Yeah, but you had two.
- I was nervous!

09:06.913 --> 09:08.312
[Justin] Mom! Emergency!

09:08.381 --> 09:11.748
The weatherman said there's
going to be a blizzard tonight.

09:11.817 --> 09:15.878
<i>Justin, don't worry, we will get you
into the city for Hairspray, I promise.</i>

09:15.955 --> 09:19.356
Like you promised me the new Fergie CD?
Which I still don't have.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.155
Come on, Mom, don't phunk with my heart.

09:22.228 --> 09:26.665
Justin, your father's not even going
to be here until 6:00. It'll be OK.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.327
But if I miss one minute of the first
act, you think this is diva now?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.701
<i>Santos is going to Hairspray?</i>

09:33.773 --> 09:35.604
He knows that's not a strip club?

09:35.675 --> 09:41.011
I might not have told him that he's
going with us to a musical just yet.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.548
Honey, what are you doing?

09:43.616 --> 09:46.084
If Santos wants to spend
more time with his son,

09:46.152 --> 09:49.121
then Santos should do stuff
that his son likes.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.588
It's a good idea, right?

09:52.024 --> 09:55.289
It is, it is... isn't it?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.061
I need another beer.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.165
So what kind of art do you do?

10:02.234 --> 10:03.929
Mostly jewelry.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.164
I love working with found objects,
but...

10:06.238 --> 10:10.004
the only thing I've found in New York
are hypodermic needles and condoms.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.566
You could sell that here.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.134
No, really. It's New York.

10:13.980 --> 10:18.246
Actually, I think the city
is a little scary.

10:18.784 --> 10:23.153
Most people feel that way at first. But
it's great once you get past the crowds

10:23.222 --> 10:25.053
and the traffic and...

10:25.124 --> 10:29.060
that occasional mystery smell you can't
get out of your hair. It's not so bad.

10:29.128 --> 10:33.224
Hey, do you wanna come with me
to the Stella McCartney party tonight?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.132
Come on, it would be really fun.
It's a VIP invite.

10:36.202 --> 10:40.901
- VIP? I've never even been an IP.
- Me neither! Feel this lettering!

10:42.074 --> 10:43.371
- I know.
- Charlie?

10:43.843 --> 10:45.401
- Henry.
- Henry?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.345
Betty. Hi.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.883
I guess you two already met.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.943
- Betty, this is my girlfriend, Charlie.
- Hi.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.882
[Knock on door]

11:30.990 --> 11:33.117
Yes?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.352
Am I interrupting...?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.387
- No. I'm just...
- What, no lunch date?

11:38.464 --> 11:40.523
No, I've just been so busy.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.230
Maybe not so busy.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.573
<i>Perfect. I have two tickets to
The Flying Dutchman at The Met tonight.</i>

11:53.646 --> 11:55.511
I was thinking a girls' night out.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.778
We could start with drinks
at the St. Regis and...

11:59.819 --> 12:01.980
Oh, darling, what is it?

12:02.054 --> 12:06.650
It's complicated...
coming back from the dead.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.685
Please, Donna Karan does it
every three years.

12:10.763 --> 12:14.859
I just didn't expect
my old friends to be so...

12:16.035 --> 12:18.299
...unforgiving.
- Honey...

12:18.370 --> 12:20.531
you don't apologize for who you are.

12:20.606 --> 12:24.201
People cried at my funeral
and now I'm back

12:24.276 --> 12:28.178
and... they want
nothing to do with me.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.010
To hell with them.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.380
One good friend is all you need.

12:33.853 --> 12:34.945
Thanks.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.832
Shhh!

12:54.907 --> 12:58.707
Hey, Accountant Man. Looking for Betty?
She's right down here.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.413
What? I'm bored.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.782
Hey, Henry.

13:06.852 --> 13:11.619
I just, um... I lost a contact...
not mine.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.723
I wanted to thank you
for getting Charlie to go out tonight.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.629
All we've done is order in
and watch movies in bed.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.891
Sounds... rough.

13:23.969 --> 13:27.461
So just tell her that
I'll meet up with her at 7:00. OK, bye.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.871
Betty...

13:29.642 --> 13:33.169
- You sure this isn't weird for you?
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.043
- Why would it be weird?
- You know, 'cause we...

13:36.115 --> 13:41.075
There was that thing, feeling...
vibe between us.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.720
No, there is no "us."

13:44.790 --> 13:49.727
So there was no...
vibe-feeling-thingy...

13:49.795 --> 13:51.990
...to be felt.
- Really?

13:53.065 --> 13:56.091
OK, then. Good.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.337
Well, have fun tonight.

14:01.841 --> 14:06.107
[Sighs] I'm still bored.
Watching nerd love is so tedious.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.375
There is no "love." We don't have
any love. He has a girlfriend.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.713
Yeah, who you invited to a party.
Pathetic-a.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.650
Well, I don't want to, but I'm stuck.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.551
Oh, grow a set, Bambi.

14:16.622 --> 14:20.922
<i>You've been working here long enough.
It's time to seize your inner Mode girl.</i>

14:20.993 --> 14:23.621
<i>- My what?
- Mode girls aren't the "other woman."</i>

14:23.696 --> 14:26.893
We are the "only women."
Fight for your little dweeb.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.161
Find this chick's weakness
and exploit it.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.759
No! That's terrible.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.270
I'm gonna take her.
I said I would, and I will.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.499
[Singsong] Doormat!

14:34.573 --> 14:36.473
Maybe I'm a bigger person than you.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.669
Don't. It's too obvious.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.846
A musical?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.713
Forget it, I'm not going.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.981
Come here. Justin is the one
who wants you to come with us.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.217
He made me get three tickets.
He wants to share this with you.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.384
He shouldn't be going
to see this stuff.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.395
- Maybe that's why he is the way he is?
- OK, stop.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.694
You're the one who wants
to spend more time with your son.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.064
All right, look. I got money
on the basketball game tonight.

15:07.139 --> 15:10.108
Listen. How about I ride
with you in the city on the train,

15:10.175 --> 15:13.872
I'll catch the game at some bar.
When the show's over, I'll pick you up?

15:15.481 --> 15:20.111
Father-son bonding on the E train.
That's some real quality time.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.719
- That's "The Chin?"
- Yep.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.354
[Betty] Why would you stand her up?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.798
Well, back in school she was a mess.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.599
She had braces and glasses
and this crazy hair.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.474
Which totally works for some people.

15:45.411 --> 15:49.142
Could you please stop looking at me
like that and just send her in?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.009
[Betty] Miss Chin.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.850
Hi, Grace. How are you?
Let me take that for you.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.189
Please have a seat.

16:02.361 --> 16:06.627
Well, this is... awkward.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.423
- Isn't it?
- Is it?

16:08.500 --> 16:10.161
Look, let me just start with...

16:11.770 --> 16:14.864
- I'm an idiot.
- Great, and I'm a Pisces.

16:15.407 --> 16:18.604
Now, do you want to discuss
your father's case?

16:18.677 --> 16:21.646
So there's nothing
we need to discuss first?

16:21.714 --> 16:24.239
You do realize I charge
by the hour, Mr. Meade?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.181
It's me. It's Daniel.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.082
And I'm Grace. That was $40.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.314
Wait a minute, you don't remember?

16:31.056 --> 16:34.548
Why should you?
Because we've never met.

16:34.626 --> 16:38.892
OK, so I've had a look at the case
and I'll be honest with you,

16:38.964 --> 16:40.522
it is not an easy one.

16:40.599 --> 16:44.194
You've done the right thing by calling,
I am the only one who can win it.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.033
- Great! So you'll take it?
- Not a chance in hell.

16:47.106 --> 16:50.075
Wait, you just said you were
the only who could win it.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.770
You said "Meet me at
the Sigma Phi New Year's party."

16:52.845 --> 16:54.142
Oh, crap.

16:54.213 --> 16:58.707
And by the way, Cindy Howard
pulled that virgin act with everyone.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.843
So I've heard.

17:00.919 --> 17:05.356
I was so excited
about my date with Daniel Meade.

17:05.424 --> 17:09.484
Instead, I ended up back at the dorm
room playing Wolfenstein on my computer.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.425
All night long.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.159
Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein,
Wolfenstein!

17:15.733 --> 17:18.498
Thanks to you,
1995 started off with a bang,

17:18.569 --> 17:20.867
or should I say... without one!

17:21.874 --> 17:24.968
- Grace!
- I bought a corsage for you.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.710
I know that's weird,
but I was new to dating.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.739
Look, I was a jerk, OK?
I probably still am.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.216
Too little, too late.

17:33.285 --> 17:37.312
I only came here to see the look
on your face when I rejected you.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.051
Grace, listen I know
you don't owe me anything,

17:40.125 --> 17:42.889
but this isn't about me.
It's about my father.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.122
He didn't stand you up.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.961
Isn't there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

17:51.103 --> 17:54.129
Every vendor in this city
is closed because of the snow.

17:54.206 --> 17:57.835
Right, you need fabric
for the Sarah Jessica Parker dress.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.346
- I see the gay-P-B's in full force.
- It's Carrie Bradshaw.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.507
We're on level pink.
Are these the designs?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.881
Taffeta? Taffe-don't.

18:06.952 --> 18:10.786
You're not putting her in an autumn
palette. She's totally a spring.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.157
Do you know something?
You're the one gay I don't like.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.057
You piss off, you're confusing me.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.359
Confusing you?
Try "saving your career."

18:19.431 --> 18:21.991
Now, let's start over.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.695
Start over?
I don't even have any fabric.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.228
"Shello"? Just repurpose
something around here.

18:28.307 --> 18:32.209
This is Sarah Jessica Parker. I can't
use something from another designer.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.871
She'll know. It'll burn her flesh.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.075
- Anyway, she wants a McKinney original.
- OK.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.779
Then we need to think outside the box.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.720
"We"?

18:44.022 --> 18:46.513
Yeah. Sometimes it's good
to be on a team.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.024
[Charlie] Are you sure
the subway's the safest way?

18:54.099 --> 18:57.557
[Betty] Yeah, I'm positive.
All the cabs are off duty anyway.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.094
- The subway's perfectly safe.
- What about the mole people down there?

19:01.173 --> 19:03.698
They're nice,
just misunderstood... Aah!

19:03.842 --> 19:07.005
- [Charlie] Are you OK?
- [Betty] Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.451
[Charlie] I don't know why
Henry wants to live in the city.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.646
I know we need accountants
in Tucson, too.

19:15.721 --> 19:21.057
Well, maybe he has bigger dreams
than that. Here, stay close.

19:29.401 --> 19:32.928
Like the music, leave a dollar.
Thanks!

19:35.541 --> 19:38.704
That was nice of you, but don't you
worry he'll spend it on crack?

19:38.777 --> 19:39.766
[Amanda] Aww!

19:39.845 --> 19:42.780
Henry's girlfriend thinks you're nice.
Hit her.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.743
Amanda?

19:46.985 --> 19:49.647
So what's your story?
Are you seeing anyone?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.053
No. Not anymore.

19:52.691 --> 19:56.127
His loss. I'm sure you're
going to find someone great.

19:59.398 --> 20:02.299
You did, and she took him.
She has got to go.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.631
Just push Stevie Nicks
in front of the train.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.553
This is crazy, there's so many people.
Don't let go of my hand!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.958
Here's your chance. Lose her.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.586
She'll freak, and be
on the next bus to Tucson.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.357
Ditch her! Ditch her!

20:40.339 --> 20:43.103
Betty! No, no!

20:43.842 --> 20:45.332
I don't know what happened!

20:46.511 --> 20:51.073
Get off at the next stop!
Get on the opposite train and come back!

20:51.149 --> 20:52.582
I'll wait for you here!

20:56.288 --> 20:59.587
Bitch move, Betty. Nice.

21:05.831 --> 21:09.130
- I can't get through, no signal.
- Here. Try the pay phone.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.502
Or not. Ewww, wet.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.869
I don't understand.
How did this even happen?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.501
Well, it was... sort of,
kind of an accident.

21:18.577 --> 21:23.276
There were a lot of people and everyone
was shoving and the doors just closed.

21:23.348 --> 21:26.943
Great. She's on the subway by herself.

21:27.019 --> 21:31.888
- She's already terrified of New York.
- I know! I feel so bad. I'm sorry.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.084
Betty, it's not your fault.

21:34.159 --> 21:36.252
Actually, it is.

21:38.730 --> 21:41.790
I think that I kind of...

21:41.867 --> 21:45.166
Iost Charlie... on purpose.

21:50.509 --> 21:55.208
[Wilhelmina] I'm so sorry about this.
We'll find a driver that has snow tires.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.044
Don't worry, I've never missed
a curtain at the Met.

21:58.116 --> 22:01.916
No big deal. You know,
I used to come to places like this.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.922
Before. Why don't we sit
and have a drink while we wait?

22:06.058 --> 22:07.992
- Peanut?
- No, thanks.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.324
The Band-Aid in the bowl
puts me off a little.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.626
[Man] Heads up!

22:14.399 --> 22:15.991
That was you!

22:17.903 --> 22:19.632
I threw that like a girl, right?

22:25.243 --> 22:28.576
I knew it! Twenty to 8:00.
I told you we should've left earlier.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.207
I promise you,
we will make the overture.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.342
I appreciate the whole effort thing,

22:33.418 --> 22:36.478
<i>but everyone knows that there's
no overture in Hairspray.</i>

22:36.555 --> 22:38.921
Yeah, Hilda. Everyone knows that.

22:39.791 --> 22:42.760
Is there something
you want to tell your son, Santos?

22:45.097 --> 22:47.122
Yo, Justin...

22:47.199 --> 22:51.101
<i>- About tonight, mijo. I don't...
- No way! This is not happening.</i>

22:52.504 --> 22:54.734
[Justin] Why, God, why?

22:56.074 --> 22:58.770
Staples? Envelopes?

22:58.844 --> 23:01.540
Coffee filters?
You were looking for fabric!

23:01.613 --> 23:03.205
There's none in the building.

23:03.281 --> 23:06.375
<i>But we don't need it.
Think Project Runway.</i>

23:06.451 --> 23:09.011
Those people made dresses
out of corn husks.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.085
If I told you these were from Paris,
you'd pay $1,000.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.717
- I can't do this. I'm going to say no.
- No!

23:14.793 --> 23:16.886
You do not say no
to Sarah Jessica Parker.

23:16.962 --> 23:19.863
- She's the Holy Grail of fashion.
- I know!

23:19.931 --> 23:21.262
This is your big chance!

23:21.333 --> 23:24.131
My chance to meet her husband,
Ferris Bueller Parker.

23:24.202 --> 23:25.669
Here, hold this. Spin.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.371
You may not get a call like this again.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.374
You have to do this.
Make it work.

23:30.442 --> 23:33.206
- She does have a quirky style.
- Quirky style.

23:33.278 --> 23:36.076
<i>[Rick James: Super Freak]</i>

23:36.148 --> 23:38.981
<i>She's a very special girl</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:42.151
<i>From her head down to her toenails</i>

23:42.220 --> 23:43.482
<i>Down to her feet</i>

23:43.555 --> 23:47.286
<i>And she'll wait for me backstage
with her girlfriends</i>

23:47.359 --> 23:49.623
<i>In her limousine</i>

23:50.629 --> 23:53.359
<i>Three's not a crowd to her, she says</i>

23:54.166 --> 23:56.828
<i>"Room 714, I'll be waiting"</i>

23:58.370 --> 24:01.703
<i>She's all right, she's all right</i>

24:01.773 --> 24:06.642
<i>That girl's all right with me...</i>

24:06.711 --> 24:09.612
No, no, no! You can't be closing.
It's just a little snow.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.478
I don't need a waiter.

24:11.550 --> 24:12.539
I don't need a cook.

24:12.617 --> 24:16.519
I just need a table for two with some
candles and a few flowers. That's it.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.090
This is Daniel Meade,
do you know that?

24:20.158 --> 24:22.353
- [Phone hangs up]
- Hello? Hello?

24:24.329 --> 24:26.297
That used to mean something.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.924
Should've used my name.

24:29.434 --> 24:33.336
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- So, what's the big surprise?

24:33.705 --> 24:37.471
Actually, I was planning
this amazing dinner at Babbo, but...

24:37.542 --> 24:39.737
Let me guess.
You're blowing me off again?

24:39.811 --> 24:42.541
No, it's not me,
it's the stupid blizzard.

24:43.215 --> 24:46.309
I just wanted to give you
the New Year's Eve we never had.

24:47.252 --> 24:51.848
Maybe I should stand out in the snow
for three hours and cry icicle tears.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.483
- Worked on that one for awhile?
- Twelve years.

24:56.528 --> 25:00.055
Look, we can still do this.
We got party hats.

25:00.131 --> 25:03.931
We got noisemakers. Look at this
gift basket Paul Smith sent over.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.994
We could have a lot of fun
right here.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.664
- Drink?
- I don't drink.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.537
- Do you eat?
- Not often.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.203
Did you really think
it was going to be that easy?

25:13.278 --> 25:16.975
I would just come over here and we'd
have a few laughs about that night?

25:17.048 --> 25:19.482
I wasn't the only one
you hurt in college.

25:20.352 --> 25:24.049
Let's see. Julie Dwyer. Remember her?

25:24.222 --> 25:26.656
- Not, uh...
- Exactly.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.488
Julie now has a husband,
two kids and a dog...

25:30.562 --> 25:32.154
That's great.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.925
...in her mind.

25:33.999 --> 25:37.059
She's in a mental institution.
Way to go, Daniel.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.631
Does the name Sarah Hayden ring a bell?

25:41.706 --> 25:46.075
Sarah now has the largest
Indigo Girls fansite on the Internet.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.578
- Are you going to kill me?
- No.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.812
I am going to make you apologize.

25:51.883 --> 25:55.785
If you want me to even consider
taking your father's case,

25:55.854 --> 25:59.881
you're going to make it up to every
woman you ever hurt in college.

26:00.492 --> 26:04.758
Oh, yeah. The Chin's all about justice.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.664
I swear, the Town Car
will be there within 15 minutes.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.364
- Ow! That's flesh!
- Well, don't move.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.363
What's going on over there?

26:16.441 --> 26:18.671
Christy and I are making a dress
for Sarah Jessica Parker.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.335
I need a staple gun.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.404
"Christy"? I take it she's on our team?

26:23.481 --> 26:27.247
We are so "besties." She taught me
how to do a butterfly stitch.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.877
Perfect. I want the two of you

26:28.954 --> 26:32.117
to be braiding each other's hair
before the night's over.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.753
Come on, WNBA! The girl's on fire!

26:36.828 --> 26:40.286
- That was just lucky.
- Actually, I'm the one who's lucky.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.925
No blizzard and I'd be home
on Staten Island

26:43.001 --> 26:44.901
and I wouldn't be here with you.

26:46.671 --> 26:50.072
- I'm Joel, by the way.
- Alexis.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.507
Alexis. Can I buy you a cocktail?

26:54.079 --> 26:57.480
I won't be staying very long.
My friend has tickets to the opera.

26:57.549 --> 27:00.040
- Oh. That sucks.
- Tell me about it.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.279
How about one more game
before you leave?

27:03.054 --> 27:04.419
All right.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.918
Good news. Marc found us a Town Car.

27:08.994 --> 27:11.326
- Great.
- You look familiar, have we met?

27:11.396 --> 27:14.524
We're not even meeting now.
Let's wait outside. Come on.

27:14.899 --> 27:19.734
Willie, any chance you want
to skip the Met and stick around here?

27:19.804 --> 27:23.831
What? Are you serious? This was
the plan. We had girls' night out.

27:23.908 --> 27:26.570
Isn't the point of girls' night
about meeting guys?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.478
Look, he's cute.
And he has friends.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.781
- Oh! Dear God.
- Come on! One shot. What do you say?

27:33.852 --> 27:36.252
It's free! Come on.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.388
[Man] Yeah!

27:41.526 --> 27:44.290
All right. Here we go.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.624
[All laughing]

27:52.070 --> 27:53.628
Nice release.

27:56.374 --> 27:57.739
One minute until curtain!

27:57.809 --> 28:00.710
This is the worst thing ever,
I am not exaggerating!

28:00.779 --> 28:04.977
You know the show inside and out. If you
miss some, you know how it starts.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.711
But Dad doesn't!

28:07.385 --> 28:09.353
And the curtain is up.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.616
I am so sorry.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.218
I think I'll be OK.

28:14.292 --> 28:17.193
It's too bad. I know you
really wanted to see it.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.988
Idea! I'll catch you up.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.556
Let me set the scene.

28:24.069 --> 28:25.832
Baltimore. 1962.

28:25.904 --> 28:29.305
The height of segregation,
beginning of the teeny bop revolution.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.901
Our heroine's... Tracy Turnblad.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.070
Chubby, but totally adorable.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.944
She wakes and begins to sing...
excuse me.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.745
<i>[Good Morning Baltimore]</i>

28:39.818 --> 28:42.184
<i>Oh, oh, woke up today</i>

28:42.253 --> 28:46.246
<i>Feeling the way I always do</i>

28:46.324 --> 28:49.725
<i>Good morning Baltimore</i>

28:49.794 --> 28:53.321
<i>Every day's like an open door</i>

28:53.398 --> 28:56.731
<i>Every night is a fantasy</i>

28:56.801 --> 29:00.259
<i>Every sound's like a symphony</i>

29:00.338 --> 29:03.273
<i>Good morning Baltimore</i>

29:03.341 --> 29:04.808
<i>[humming]</i>

29:04.876 --> 29:06.104
Excuse me.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.811
Don't dance near the guy
with his hand under his coat.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.979
I don't understand.
Did something happen between you?

29:18.056 --> 29:19.614
No. Nothing.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.386
- Did she say something?
- No.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.695
- I don't get it. You don't like her?
- No, I like her.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.929
- Then what's the problem?
- I like you too!

29:32.003 --> 29:33.664
There, I said it!

29:37.142 --> 29:38.302
Why didn't you tell me?

29:38.376 --> 29:40.071
Why didn't you tell me you
had a girlfriend?

29:40.145 --> 29:42.409
- You have a boyfriend.
- Who I broke up with!

29:42.480 --> 29:45.142
- What?
- For you!

29:53.124 --> 29:55.615
I thought a lot about what I did to you.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.459
I'm so sorry.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.624
I never meant to hurt you.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.831
OK, so, thank you, nurse.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.396
You'll give Julie the message when
she gets out of the "quiet room"?

30:10.842 --> 30:12.241
OK. Thanks. Bye.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.474
OK. So, um...

30:17.115 --> 30:19.583
...Debra Rossner is next?

30:20.451 --> 30:22.817
You know, you actually sound sincere.

30:24.455 --> 30:27.117
You really would do anything
to help your father.

30:28.126 --> 30:32.119
Come on. It's not like I don't regret
some of the things I've done in life.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.729
You know, your sadness is...

30:37.869 --> 30:39.860
...kind of a turn-on.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.967
The Chin likes remorse.

30:48.313 --> 30:53.910
- I am sad. I am so sad.
- Shh! Don't talk. You'll ruin it.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.790
<i>[Becks] Hello, hello?</i>

31:01.259 --> 31:03.193
Daniel? You there?

31:03.962 --> 31:06.897
How many more of these calls
am I going to have to take?

31:07.265 --> 31:08.755
OK, I'm hanging up.

31:08.833 --> 31:10.926
<i>[Moaning over the phone]</i>

31:11.035 --> 31:14.994
OK. I'm not hanging up.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.267
Nice!

31:21.012 --> 31:24.004
[Announcer on TV]

31:27.919 --> 31:29.648
Alexis, our driver's here.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.689
Would you hate me if I didn't go?

31:31.756 --> 31:34.782
- Opera's totally wasted on me.
- [Joel] Yes!

31:34.859 --> 31:36.918
- What did I miss?
- Sweet three pointer.

31:38.429 --> 31:40.329
So much for our night.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.237
[Clears throat]

31:52.677 --> 31:54.372
What's this?

31:54.445 --> 31:56.606
Hopefully, your phone number.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.392
Got it!

32:16.901 --> 32:17.890
What's going on?

32:17.969 --> 32:22.235
My boys back there bet me I didn't have
the stones to get your phone number.

32:22.307 --> 32:24.901
I don't live in a cave, dude.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.470
I know exactly who you are,

32:28.546 --> 32:32.949
and I don't hit on freaks,
unless I know I'm getting paid for it.

32:35.353 --> 32:40.381
Pardon me. You know, Joel, I was rude
not to introduce myself to you earlier.

32:44.362 --> 32:47.160
That's what friends are for. Come on.

32:48.933 --> 32:50.059
[Joel grunts]

32:52.337 --> 32:56.330
Tracy totally ends up dancing on the
Corny Collins show. It's way satisfying.

32:56.407 --> 33:01.276
- And then, she has this killer song.
- Hey, kid. Think maybe we had enough?

33:05.049 --> 33:07.609
- Fairy.
- Excuse me?

33:07.685 --> 33:09.619
No, no. Hold on.

33:12.090 --> 33:15.491
<i>Hey, you got something to say, man?
Hmm? Digame, chico.</i>

33:17.195 --> 33:20.096
<i>My son's going to finish
telling me about the Hairspray.</i>

33:20.164 --> 33:23.099
When he's done, you better clap.
All right?

33:34.379 --> 33:36.939
Keep going. I want to know
what happens to Tracy.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.506
And you're right, it's way satisfying.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.412
Reprise...

33:54.732 --> 33:59.863
Let it go, sweetie. Two weeks ago
that idiot wasn't even walking upright.

34:01.272 --> 34:05.402
I had all these ideas of
how it would be when I came back...

34:07.678 --> 34:09.908
...but people are kind of awful.

34:11.916 --> 34:16.319
Well, don't forget, there are some
people that have been good to you.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.150
You have...

34:22.427 --> 34:24.257
...and so has Daniel.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.492
What?

34:27.565 --> 34:30.466
I thought he'd reject me
like my father did.

34:30.534 --> 34:34.266
- But he didn't.
- Now you're making me nervous.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.829
You are going to fire Daniel

34:36.908 --> 34:38.899
and make me Editor-in-Chief, right?

34:38.976 --> 34:42.775
- He's my brother, Willie.
- He is the enemy.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.246
See, that's the thing.

34:45.315 --> 34:47.216
I've kind of realized he's not.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.085
Think about what you're saying.
We worked for months...

34:51.155 --> 34:54.556
Look, you're the best
Creative Director in the business.

34:54.625 --> 34:57.890
- We can talk about salary.
- Stop the car!

34:57.962 --> 34:59.190
Willie...

34:59.263 --> 35:01.823
You know, you may be new
at being a woman,

35:01.899 --> 35:04.060
but you're an old pro at being a bitch.

35:05.937 --> 35:06.926
[Scoffs]

35:18.416 --> 35:20.077
Betty? Can we talk?

35:20.151 --> 35:22.676
No. I'm getting some food,
and I'm going home.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.584
Please tell Charlie that I'm sorry.

35:24.655 --> 35:29.354
- At least let me pay for your pretzel.
- No. I don't want anything from you.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.624
OK, a dollar. Thank you.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.062
You're welcome.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.468
Here, I know you like extra mustard...

35:37.535 --> 35:40.527
Listen, Walter and I...
it wasn't about you.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.699
I broke up with him
because I wasn't in love with him.

35:43.774 --> 35:48.211
I don't know why I blamed it on you.
Maybe it was easier.

35:58.556 --> 36:02.117
If you didn't love him
then you did the right thing.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.529
My timing sucks.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.729
Well, now you'll probably
meet someone new.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.243
Someone who'll see
how wonderful you are.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.138
And caring.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.815
And beautiful.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.663
- Is this a good idea?
- No.

36:45.169 --> 36:46.693
Henry!

36:46.771 --> 36:48.568
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

36:48.639 --> 36:50.766
Betty! [laughs]

36:55.146 --> 36:58.081
- Are you OK?
- That subway ride rocked!

36:58.716 --> 37:00.650
People are so nice in this city!

37:01.018 --> 37:03.248
There was this one guy,
he touched my butt,

37:03.321 --> 37:05.881
but after I maced him
he got me on the right train.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.755
So you like New York?

37:08.826 --> 37:10.623
I heart New York!

37:10.695 --> 37:13.687
Honey, I'm staying.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.923
I want to try and make it work here.

37:17.001 --> 37:20.266
And Betty, oh, Betty, it was like...

37:20.338 --> 37:23.034
It was like fate that got us separated!

37:23.107 --> 37:25.632
Yeah. Yeah, fate's awesome.

37:27.111 --> 37:30.137
So, are we still
going to go to that party?

37:30.214 --> 37:34.844
Because we can just get on
the D train and change at Chambers.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.012
I totally sound like a New Yorker.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.450
[Spits]

37:39.557 --> 37:41.718
- That was my shoe.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

37:43.661 --> 37:45.561
You know what? Um...

37:45.630 --> 37:48.690
I think I'm going to go home.
You guys go to the party.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.666
Henry should be your plus one.

37:51.469 --> 37:54.597
- Betty.
- Yeah, yeah. OK.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.932
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.646
Hello, media!

38:06.717 --> 38:09.277
It's amazing what you can
accomplish when sober.

38:09.353 --> 38:12.447
- Harsh words.
- And Sarah Jessica's going to love!

38:12.523 --> 38:14.889
- I know!
- Listen up, people.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.154
Our dear friend Alexis has betrayed us.

38:17.228 --> 38:19.856
She's keeping Daniel as Editor-in-Chief.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.761
- What?
- Don't worry.

38:21.832 --> 38:25.199
I'm not going gently into this
good night. We need a new plan.

38:25.269 --> 38:28.067
Excuse me. Where do you think
you're going?

38:28.839 --> 38:31.831
I'm not one of your flying monkeys,
Wilhelmina.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.469
Like hell you aren't.
I gave you your wings.

38:34.545 --> 38:38.504
Sarah Jessica Parker wouldn't know you
if I hadn't put you in Fashion Week.

38:39.350 --> 38:43.081
Don't cross me, sweetheart,
because you'll lose.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.858
So, let's talk about your father's case.

38:50.928 --> 38:54.159
Now? It's kind of a buzzkill, no?

38:54.231 --> 38:57.962
Not for me. The law makes me hot.

39:03.107 --> 39:06.167
A friend at the DA's office told me
the case against your father

39:06.243 --> 39:08.973
isn't as strong
as they're leading everyone to believe.

39:09.046 --> 39:12.914
All right, quick. Before the blood
leaves my brain. How so?

39:12.983 --> 39:15.884
Mostly circumstantial evidence.
Barely a motive.

39:15.953 --> 39:19.889
Plus, they can't even track down their
"star witness." Person's a ghost.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.123
What do you mean?

39:23.194 --> 39:27.688
Couple of witnesses claim they saw
a blue Aston Martin stopped on the road.

39:27.765 --> 39:32.031
Probably saw the whole accident.
No luck tracking the witness down.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.035
Blue Aston Martin?

39:44.315 --> 39:48.081
Why would you tell our son's assistant
that you killed Fey?

39:48.152 --> 39:52.316
Our family is falling apart.
Don't get angry at me.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.382
You were supposed to stay quiet,
let me handle everything.

39:55.459 --> 39:58.622
And look where it got you.

39:58.696 --> 40:02.291
You're here because of me.
Because of what I did.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.970
- I'm turning myself in.
- No! Claire?

40:10.574 --> 40:12.269
- [Door lock buzzing]
- Claire!

40:15.279 --> 40:16.610
Claire!

40:21.218 --> 40:22.515
Claire.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.648
- [Humming]
- [Phone rings]

40:27.458 --> 40:29.585
Hello. Christina McKinney.

40:30.227 --> 40:31.626
Yes.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.833
Oh... right.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.529
