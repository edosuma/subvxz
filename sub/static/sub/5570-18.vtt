WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.570
Previously on Limitless...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.438
Do not tell anyone about this.
I mean it.

00:04.472 --> 00:05.473
You put your sister

00:05.506 --> 00:07.575
in danger-- undercover agent

00:07.608 --> 00:09.610
bleeding out on
the kitchen table.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.312
I love you, Brian,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.614
but unless you start making
some different choices,

00:13.647 --> 00:14.782
you are not welcome here.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.785
When all of this started,
we made promises to each other.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.220
I know. I didn't mean
to lie to you.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.221
I just spoke to Naz.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.722
You're being assigned
to a different handler.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.757
Your mom mentioned
an undercover agent.

00:23.791 --> 00:24.692
Yeah.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.094
Could you describe him for me?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.228
My name's Sands.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.463
You belong to Mr. Morra
now, which means

00:29.497 --> 00:30.798
you belong to me.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.800
Did you kill
Piper Baird's boyfriend?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.568
(sighs) She found you.
I thought she might.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.469
I know how Morra works.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.271
He has a way of corrupting
good people.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.806
You're one of them.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.141
Same way I was.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.775
You can't play
both sides forever.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.145
I'm gonna figure out
how that enzyme works, Brian.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.314
You can be free
of Morra for good.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.682
If Morra ever finds out
that you are still alive,

00:48.716 --> 00:51.385
then everything that means
anything to me is gone.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.823
(dance music playing)

00:57.291 --> 00:58.826
* Oh, my gosh

01:00.261 --> 01:01.629
* Oh, my gosh...

01:01.662 --> 01:03.131
MAN (Russian accent):
Are you sure

01:03.164 --> 01:06.367
this girl in
St. Petersburg?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.336
I tracked her here.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.138
Her real name's Piper Baird.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.641
She's been traveling using
an alias: Frances Houseman.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.410
She checked into a hotel
in Lower Nevsky.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.846
That was, like, two weeks ago.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.382
And you think
I can help you find her?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.251
Well, I asked around.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.254
Everyone said
Vladi knows things.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.232
Well, I can see.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.433
No promises.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.439
You might not like answer.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.541
A beautiful girl disappears,

01:47.575 --> 01:49.910
usually means one of two things.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.146
Neither good.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.916
So...

01:55.949 --> 01:58.152
who is this girl?

01:59.653 --> 02:02.456
Why are you in Petersburg?

02:02.490 --> 02:04.325
That's my business.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.329
You refuse drink?

02:08.362 --> 02:09.797
Is not polite

02:09.830 --> 02:12.266
to refuse drink.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.278
So it's really not
that complicated.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.779
I mean,
things got weird at work.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.681
Right?
My partner...

02:27.715 --> 02:29.583
my handler...

02:29.617 --> 02:32.386
whatever she is, she was like,

02:32.420 --> 02:34.322
"I just feel like
you're lying to me

02:34.355 --> 02:35.856
pretty much always."

02:35.889 --> 02:37.858
And my family--
they pretty much just said,

02:37.891 --> 02:40.361
"You know, you're
a big disappointment."

02:40.394 --> 02:43.364
"And you should pretty much
just take off."

02:43.397 --> 02:45.766
So it all built up,
and one day I was like,

02:45.799 --> 02:47.000
"I got to get out. Right?

02:47.034 --> 02:50.238
"I mean, I just got to...
I just got to just get out.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.305
Right?"

02:51.339 --> 02:53.474
I'm not saying I'm a big deal,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.643
per se. All right?

02:55.676 --> 02:59.447
But if I just took off,
people would notice.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.781
I mean, they would be like,

03:00.814 --> 03:03.617
"Where the frick is Brian?"

03:03.651 --> 03:06.387
"Brian just, like... whew.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.955
"He's gone. You know?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.290
He just left."

03:09.323 --> 03:10.391
And Naz will be like,

03:10.424 --> 03:11.825
"What do you mean,
he's gone, ja?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.494
He's not allowed to just go."

03:13.527 --> 03:14.795
And Rebecca will be all like,

03:14.828 --> 03:16.464
"Hey, what do you want from me?
Dude's gone."

03:16.497 --> 03:18.432
And you know Boyle's
gonna have an opinion.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.668
"I knew something
like this would happen.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.370
"Brian's a flake.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.004
He wears dumb sweaters."

03:24.037 --> 03:25.939
And Naz will say,
"Whatever on the sweaters, ja?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.308
Just find him."

03:27.341 --> 03:29.310
And so, you know...

03:29.343 --> 03:30.411
(sighs)

03:30.444 --> 03:33.447
...there's the whole
"on the run" aspect to consider.

03:33.481 --> 03:37.751
So why are you so important
to these people?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.954
I am so important
to these people...

03:40.988 --> 03:43.391
Hmm.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.393
I... You know what? That-that's
where it gets tricky,

03:45.426 --> 03:48.529
'cause I-I can't...
I can't really talk about that.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.763
*

03:49.797 --> 03:51.699
It's called NZT.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.434
NZT.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.670
Now... How much of this
are you understanding, Evgeny?

03:56.704 --> 03:57.671
None?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.273
Good.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.342
So I took two pills
from my bodyguards

04:01.375 --> 04:04.412
before I left, and I'm pretty
sure they told Rebecca.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.547
"Look, we don't how to
tell you this, but Brian--

04:06.580 --> 04:07.448
"he took two pills.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.517
And we were powerless
to resist."

04:09.550 --> 04:11.485
So... (laughs)

04:11.519 --> 04:14.522
I honestly have no idea
what she's gonna do.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.890
You're definitely
not understanding, like,

04:16.924 --> 04:18.626
any of this, are you?

04:20.628 --> 04:21.862
And Piper-- she is...

04:21.895 --> 04:24.432
Look, I only met her
a couple of times,

04:24.465 --> 04:25.733
but she is amazing.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.534
Seriously.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.402
I mean, how many people
can say...

04:30.438 --> 04:33.006
"I'm a chemist or a biochemist
or something,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.676
"and I also totally know
how to use a sniper rifle.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.678
"And the last time I saw Brian,

04:37.711 --> 04:40.581
"I gave him a little kiss
on the cheek.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.016
"But maybe it was more than
a kiss on the cheek.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.552
You know?"

04:44.585 --> 04:46.520
So if Piper can make
the immunity shot,

04:46.554 --> 04:48.556
then Sands can't
control me anymore,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.591
and I can finally tell him,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
"Hey, Sands,
you know what, man?

04:52.493 --> 04:53.961
Cram it!"

04:53.994 --> 04:56.930
And he'll have to say,
"I will, Brian.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.367
I will cram it."

04:59.400 --> 05:02.636
So I used one pill
to track Piper here...

05:02.670 --> 05:04.905
which means
I've got one pill left.

05:04.938 --> 05:05.906
Oh, hey, man.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.575
How you doing?

05:07.608 --> 05:10.778
So I wonder if I can use
that one to find her,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.347
and then we can get
out of whole mess, you know?

05:13.381 --> 05:16.517
Then everyone--
Rebecca, my family, everyone--

05:16.550 --> 05:17.818
will be like,

05:17.851 --> 05:20.354
"You fixed it, Brian.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.690
You rule."

05:22.723 --> 05:26.960
That's why I'm kind of all-in
on this Piper thing though.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.397
Good news, my friend.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.998
That was fast.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.534
Konstantin talked to
a man named Yuri.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.536
Yuri texted the picture

05:35.569 --> 05:38.539
to his cousin Andrea
who knows things,

05:38.572 --> 05:41.875
and she says,
"My friend's girlfriend's
cousin

05:41.909 --> 05:45.413
shares a cell with that girl
in Kresty Prison."

05:45.446 --> 05:47.648
Wait. What?

05:49.517 --> 05:52.820
Your friend, she is not
dead or sex slave.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.489
She is in prison.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.691
Congratulations.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.727
*

06:02.863 --> 06:04.865
*

06:27.688 --> 06:29.423
BRIAN:
That's Kresty Prison.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.760
If there was a competition
for worst place in the world,

06:32.793 --> 06:35.796
it could give 1970s Detroit
a run for its money.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.503
And that is my last NZT pill.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.506
From the second I take this,
I have 12 hours to get there,

06:45.539 --> 06:46.740
gain entry, find Piper,

06:46.774 --> 06:49.643
and then break out with her
before the dose wears off.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.111
SECOND BRIAN:
Or die trying.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.581
Which, let's face it,

06:53.614 --> 06:55.583
is really the most
likely scenario.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.917
You don't know that.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.653
I mean... I don't know that?

06:59.687 --> 07:01.822
Come on, man.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.724
Every second
you're on NZT,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.460
there is an oddsmaker
running numbers in your head.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.665
So, what's the over-under
on you surviving this?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.467
That depends
on the plan.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.536
And which one of the plans
that you totally don't have

07:15.569 --> 07:17.104
is the one where
you get away alive?

07:17.137 --> 07:18.839
I'm working on it.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.641
Helpful fact:

07:20.674 --> 07:24.111
in 115 years, exactly one person
has escaped this prison.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.013
So escape is possible.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.816
And that person was,
you know, Russian

07:28.849 --> 07:31.752
and inside the prison
and not you.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.953
Hmm.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.489
All right.
I'll run scenarios with you.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.124
Frontal assault?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.861
BRIAN:
Open the gates! Please!

07:40.894 --> 07:42.195
(rapid gunfire)

07:44.197 --> 07:46.500
BRIAN:
All right, okay, I get it.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.868
We've got 12 hours.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.703
Brute force approach is a no-go.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.104
Surely there are
other outcomes.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.140
Of course there are.
And don't call me Shirley.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.142
(both laugh)

07:55.175 --> 07:59.012
On the other hand, you are in
a country where, rumor has it,

07:59.046 --> 08:02.516
corruption and graft
hold actual sway.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.251
I don't even know
how much I have left in rubles.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.886
I mean, Vladi wasn't cheap.

08:05.919 --> 08:09.289
There are
other forms of currency.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.258
Influence, for example.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.693
Okay, all right.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.294
So...

08:14.327 --> 08:16.229
who is the most
influential person

08:16.263 --> 08:20.000
in the St. Petersburg
prison system?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.202
BOYLE: Okay, so State tells
us that someone in Moscow

08:22.235 --> 08:24.938
broke the bank at a casino
betting on the roulette wheel.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.608
A CIA asset says someone stole
a shipment of hand grenades

08:27.641 --> 08:29.242
from an arms dealer
in Georgia.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.711
They're outliers.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.045
They could have
been enabled by NZT,

08:32.079 --> 08:33.146
but does that sound like Brian?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.682
Well, those guys at State,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.116
they don't know Finch
the way we do.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.250
NAZ:
Hey.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.587
I've got a conference call
with D.C. in five minutes.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.622
What can I tell them
about Brian's whereabouts?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.325
Well, we know
he traveled to Moscow

08:45.358 --> 08:46.860
on the, um...

08:46.894 --> 08:48.629
fake passport you gave him.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.330
I'll leave that part out,
thanks.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.733
Well, we don't know if
that was his final destination,

08:52.766 --> 08:54.167
and we don't have the authority

08:54.201 --> 08:56.336
to do a damn thing
on Russian soil.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.437
So the, uh,

08:57.470 --> 09:00.941
Diplomatic Security Service,
they're working it hard.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.275
The CIA has their assets

09:02.309 --> 09:04.144
keeping their
ears open,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.246
and NSA,
they've cast a...

09:06.279 --> 09:07.247
In other words,

09:07.280 --> 09:08.315
nothing new.
No.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.255
Naz.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.824
Are you gonna tell them?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.058
On your call,
are you gonna tell them

09:18.091 --> 09:19.727
that Brian brought
two pills with him?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.595
To Russia?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.263
A country we are
currently sanctioning?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.765
If D.C. finds out

09:24.798 --> 09:26.834
that Brian brought NZT
into Russia,

09:26.867 --> 09:29.069
this becomes an entirely
different kind of manhunt.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.739
Now, I am pissed off with Finch,

09:31.772 --> 09:33.206
but I know
he's not a spy.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.608
I just don't
want him to get shot.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.910
I want him to come home
in one piece

09:36.944 --> 09:38.812
so I can shoot him.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.849
(phone chimes)

09:41.882 --> 09:43.216
IKE:
Can I have a word?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.886
We're down in the file room.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.955
Look, I don't know
if this is anything at all.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.757
But I also know
that we're stuck here

09:49.790 --> 09:51.659
waiting for the State
Department to find Finch.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.760
So we hope
this will help.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.861
We were at the house, right?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.128
When he had
the big blowup

09:55.162 --> 09:57.264
with his family,
we were there.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.000
But something came up
while they were fighting.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.402
I guess Brian's sister
was at the safe house

10:02.435 --> 10:04.337
and someone showed up
with a stab wound.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.375
Brian told her
he was an undercover agent,

10:08.408 --> 10:10.978
but he did an emergency
procedure on the guy

10:11.011 --> 10:12.746
in the middle of the night.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.981
That doesn't make any sense.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.750
Why would one of our people
go to Brian for medical care?

10:16.784 --> 10:17.818
Right?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.019
Now, I know Rachel a little.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.287
I-I asked her about it,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.055
but she really
wouldn't talk to me.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.191
She said Brian told her
not to talk to anyone about it.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.127
Now, it could be nothing.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.897
But... I don't know,
it feels weird.

10:29.930 --> 10:33.701
And anything could be a lead
at this point, right?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
Yeah, thanks.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
Sorry.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.042
Room just didn't feel
right without those on.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.112
*

10:47.047 --> 10:49.449
BRIAN: So it turns out that the
biggest of all judicial bigwigs

10:49.482 --> 10:51.018
in St. Petersburg is that guy,

10:51.051 --> 10:53.687
Maxim Lavrov,
Deputy Prosecutor General.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.889
Oh, no, I understand
you're a very busy man.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.792
But this really shouldn't
take longer than...

10:58.826 --> 11:00.427
I don't know, 15 minutes?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.429
But I can't tell you
who I'm talking to.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.297
That part's a surprise.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.966
Hey, now.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.102
I heard you out for,
what, three hours?

11:09.136 --> 11:11.071
You can give me 15 minutes.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.272
Thank you.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.442
I just had to dig around
a little bit in Lavrov's life,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.344
see what I could learn.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.012
It was kind of a busy day.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.013
(bell dings)

11:20.047 --> 11:21.248
One more thing.
Dobbry Den!

11:21.281 --> 11:22.249
We were speaking Russian.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.284
But I'll translate for you.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.254
(bell dings)

11:27.287 --> 11:28.421
Good afternoon.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.725
I'm here to see Maxim Lavrov.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.360
I don't have an appointment,
but you can tell him

11:33.393 --> 11:36.129
that I'm here to discuss
"The Iron Price."

11:40.267 --> 11:43.871
Where did you hear this name,
"The Iron Price"?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.372
I did a little digging around.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.741
Some light hacking of firewalls.

11:47.775 --> 11:48.842
No, wait!

11:48.876 --> 11:50.778
Hear me out,
hear me out, hear me out.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.012
"The Iron Price."

11:52.045 --> 11:54.214
That is the screen name you use

11:54.247 --> 11:56.316
on Game of Thrones
message boards.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.219
You've got, like, 20,000 posts
between three different sites.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.021
You're a little obsessed, man.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.022
Sir.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.158
These books, they are
a saga of realpolitik.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.027
There is much
to learn from them.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.495
I'm not here to judge.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.130
I'm really not.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.999
I can dig it, man.
I love the show.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.266
I'm here to help.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.168
Help?
Yeah.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.036
I bought this phone.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.270
I got in touch with

12:17.304 --> 12:18.471
George R.R. Martin's

12:18.505 --> 12:20.107
publisher, who said,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.009
"All requests to talk
to Mr. Martin

12:22.042 --> 12:24.011
have to go through
his publicist."

12:24.044 --> 12:26.146
She told me,
"Look, the guy's crazy busy.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.015
I can't just give you
his phone number."

12:28.048 --> 12:29.016
But after a few white lies,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.150
I was on the phone
with the man himself.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.053
I told him I was in a
complicated situation in Russia.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.155
And it turns out he's in
a complicated situation

12:35.188 --> 12:38.158
for this other project he's been
trying to find time for.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.127
We talked for...

12:40.160 --> 12:42.863
way more time
than I had to spare.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.832
Kicked around a few ideas.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.834
I think he's got
a great handle on it now.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.302
And in exchange
for the help,

12:49.336 --> 12:51.839
he's willing to tell you
how it all ends.

12:51.872 --> 12:55.275
The fate of Westeros
and all its inhabitants.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.144
Turns out
he's always known that.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.513
George R.R. Martin
is on that phone?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.548
I hope so.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.817
You still there?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.185
And all I need from you

13:05.218 --> 13:07.387
is for you to help my friend
out of a jam.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.257
So this is a bribe.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.126
I guess.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.127
Kind of.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.128
Yeah.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.496
But, look, come on, man.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.199
It's the end of
A Song of Ice and Fire.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.470
He took the call.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.138
The Deputy Prosecutor General

13:25.172 --> 13:28.208
talked to George R.R. Martin
for, like, five minutes.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.977
Then he had me put in cuffs.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
Maybe he didn't like
the ending.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.213
I almost had the cuffs open

13:33.246 --> 13:34.514
when they pulled
the truck over.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.122
(grunts)

13:42.155 --> 13:43.490
Hey, did I forget to mention

13:43.523 --> 13:45.558
that there are people
looking for me, you know?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.627
Americans, you know.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.196
We tend to be tenacious.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.865
Mr. Lavrov invites you to leave
our country immediately.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.202
And never to speak of this
to anyone.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.272
Brian?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.342
(chuckles)

14:02.375 --> 14:04.044
Hi.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.145
Are you okay?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.514
How did you do this?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.183
It is a very long story

14:10.217 --> 14:11.251
involving another
really long story.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.853
Can I tell you about it
on the way to the airport?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.491
Thank you.
Yeah.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
You're okay.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.029
You're out.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.063
Okay?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.197
Piper, listen to me.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.199
I came here because
I need your help.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.300
Okay?

14:27.334 --> 14:28.601
I'm ready.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.271
Okay? I'm ready to be done
with Morra, with Sands,

14:31.304 --> 14:32.305
all of it.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.673
Like I said,
a lot of details.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.076
And I'd rather tell you
on the way out of here, okay?

14:36.109 --> 14:36.944
Brian...

14:36.977 --> 14:37.644
Yeah?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.312
I can't leave yet.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.183
I'm almost done,
but the last thing I need

14:43.216 --> 14:45.118
to synthesize the shot,
it's here.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.520
I got arrested
trying to steal it.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.922
Uh-huh.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.224
And you want
to do that again now?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.193
I don't have a choice.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.695
If I'm ever gonna
make the enzyme,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.297
we can't leave Russia.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.331
Great.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.044
PIPER: It's called
Roarke's Delphinium.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.946
It speciated from
the common flower

15:12.980 --> 15:15.382
after the nuclear tests
in Socorro County.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
Thrives in
radioactive soil,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.686
and it's one of the rarest
plants in the world.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.489
The oil you extract
from the seeds

15:22.522 --> 15:23.991
of Roarke's Delphinium--

15:24.024 --> 15:25.525
it's one of the last ingredients

15:25.558 --> 15:28.128
in the booster shots
that Senator Morra gives you.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.363
Is that why
you're in St. Petersburg?

15:30.397 --> 15:33.300
Fourth wealthiest
person in Russia,

15:33.333 --> 15:34.367
Nikolai Zukov.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.205
He made billions in oil
after the Soviet Union fell.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.539
The older he gets,

15:39.572 --> 15:40.673
the more paranoid
he becomes

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
about the end of the world.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.978
His latest pet project
is a seed vault

15:45.012 --> 15:46.179
that he keeps
underneath his house.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.416
I got arrested
trying to get in there.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.587
And now that you're free,
you really want to try it again?

15:54.621 --> 15:58.458
If you want those booster shots,
we don't have a choice.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.427
You want my help?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.530
(laughs)

16:03.563 --> 16:04.664
I don't know what good I'd be.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.068
I mean, I used my last NZT
to get you out of prison.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.569
I have some.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.108
I timed my last attempt
to one of Zukov's vacations,

16:15.142 --> 16:18.111
but his security was too good.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.580
And you think it's gotten less
good, now that you got caught

16:20.613 --> 16:21.614
trying to break in?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.051
No.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.718
But he's having a benefit
to raise money

16:25.752 --> 16:27.754
for the Russian Botanical
Society in a week.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.556
There's gonna be
hundreds of people there,

16:29.589 --> 16:32.025
and if we can slip in
under cover of the party...

16:32.059 --> 16:34.127
We can steal the seeds.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.131
Look, we could wind up
in prison,

16:38.165 --> 16:39.332
or worse.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.502
You want to go home, I get it.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.472
(knocking at door)

16:47.074 --> 16:48.541
Special Agent Harris.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.643
Mrs. Finch.
May I come in?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.450
Thank you for having me over.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.518
MARIE: I assume
if you knew anything

16:58.551 --> 17:01.188
about Brian's whereabouts,
you would tell us, yes?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.391
I don't.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.527
I was hoping Rachel
could help with that.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.629
Uh, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

17:09.662 --> 17:13.500
Actually, Rachel told me
what she had to say,

17:13.533 --> 17:14.667
and I honestly don't see

17:14.701 --> 17:16.669
how this could point us
to where Brian is.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.507
Well, it's my understanding
that Brian spoke to you

17:20.540 --> 17:23.776
about, um, an undercover agent
at his apartment.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.112
His apartment?

17:25.145 --> 17:28.315
You mean the safe house

17:28.348 --> 17:30.617
that the FBI
is providing Brian with.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.119
Right.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
I was hoping
that you could provide

17:33.653 --> 17:35.155
a description of that man.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.423
Why?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.758
Excuse me?

17:38.791 --> 17:43.663
Why is a description of this man
relevant to finding my son?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.499
Mr. Finch, the entire
Cross-Jurisdictional Command

17:46.533 --> 17:47.600
is searching for Brian.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.636
We are exhausting every lead...

17:49.669 --> 17:51.404
Yeah, because you have
no idea where he is.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.840
You're just flailing about,
hoping that somebody will

17:53.873 --> 17:55.642
accidentally point you
in the right direction.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.844
You can understand
how this doesn't exactly

17:57.877 --> 17:59.612
fill me with confidence.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.514
I'm sorry.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.416
Mr. Finch,
are you formally acting

18:03.450 --> 18:05.618
as Rachel's legal counsel?

18:05.652 --> 18:07.620
Because I'm not here
to interrogate anyone.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.289
I'm simply trying
to get to the bottom

18:09.322 --> 18:10.657
of what happened
in that apartment.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.858
No.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.661
I'm not formally
representing my daughter.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.364
I wanted to speak candidly
with you, Agent Harris,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.799
because frankly...

18:19.832 --> 18:21.334
I'm pissed.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.271
I understand.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.639
No, you don't.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.709
You have no idea.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.678
The last time I saw you here,

18:31.711 --> 18:34.281
you were standing just about
where you're standing now

18:34.314 --> 18:36.883
and you called my son
a murderer.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.619
RACHEL:
He did save your life, Dad.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.223
Yeah.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.425
He did.
You're right, sweetheart.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.295
He did save my life,
and I think about it every day.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.698
And every time I do, I wonder
if this was my fault.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.765
If I hadn't been sick,

18:52.799 --> 18:54.701
could he just have walked away
from all of this--

18:54.734 --> 18:56.135
from the FBI, from the drugs?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.606
I can rationalize all this away,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.908
because I have my life,
I had my son,

19:01.941 --> 19:04.777
I could see him,
I could talk to him...

19:04.811 --> 19:05.845
Mr. Finch, I...

19:05.878 --> 19:07.714
Where is my son?!

19:07.747 --> 19:09.682
What the hell have
you people done to him?

19:09.716 --> 19:13.453
And why in God's name should I,
or anyone else in my family,

19:13.486 --> 19:14.887
help you in this case
of yours...

19:16.589 --> 19:18.958
...absent a guarantee
of his safe return?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.528
Can you provide that guarantee?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.796
No.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.165
I think maybe we should
do this another time.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.372
Okay.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.574
Another time.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.842
Agent Harris.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.977
Yes, sir?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.313
Next time you want to talk
to anybody in my family

19:40.347 --> 19:42.615
about Brian,
you issue a summons,

19:42.649 --> 19:45.418
and we'll testify
formally under oath.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.688
But otherwise...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.757
we have nothing to say.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.630
BRIAN:
In case you were wondering

19:57.664 --> 20:00.633
if I decided to stay
in St. Petersburg...

20:00.667 --> 20:02.302
I mean, it was only a week.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.537
And sure, we had to save
the last of our NZT,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.706
but there was plenty of vodka.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.708
*

20:08.741 --> 20:09.942
And snow.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.346
And vodka!

20:13.380 --> 20:15.982
And borscht.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.485
And what else
do you need, really?

20:18.518 --> 20:19.786
There was also work to do.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.588
Piper walked me through
Zukov's property:

20:21.621 --> 20:22.522
the seed vault,

20:22.555 --> 20:25.858
the weaknesses
in his security system.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.528
Without NZT, it took
our combined efforts

20:28.561 --> 20:30.263
to remember enough
about hacking to break into

20:30.297 --> 20:32.832
the Russian Botanical Society's
invite list.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.001
But in about three days,
we were in.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.870
In three more days, we'd combed
through all the guests

20:37.904 --> 20:39.472
who had RSVP'd "no"

20:39.506 --> 20:41.574
until we found Benjamin
and Olivia McMahon.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.410
Not only were they
American born,

20:43.443 --> 20:45.812
but they bore enough of
a resemblance to Piper and I

20:45.845 --> 20:47.714
that we could make it work.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.748
Only problem?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.750
Olivia is the daughter
of a mining magnate,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.452
which means she is loaded.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.721
(playing "No Easy Way Out")

20:54.754 --> 20:56.856
So I had to earn money somehow.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.725
And I'm not saying
I raked in the rubles,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.760
but I did make enough
to afford what we needed

21:00.793 --> 21:03.796
to pass ourselves off
as Mr. and Mrs. McMahon.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.466
* Ain't no easy way out

21:06.499 --> 21:08.468
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...

21:08.501 --> 21:11.904
I didn't forget about
my old life completely.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.674
I shot Rebecca an e-mail
once or twice

21:14.707 --> 21:16.776
so she could let everyone know
I was okay.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.445
I told her that I met a girl,

21:18.478 --> 21:20.046
and that I'd be home soon,
and she said,

21:20.079 --> 21:22.715
"You met a girl? In Russia?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.452
Brian, get your ass
back here now!"

21:25.485 --> 21:27.820
So, basically,
that all took a week.

21:27.854 --> 21:31.524
In between all the,
uh, you know...

21:31.558 --> 21:32.859
(laughing)

21:32.892 --> 21:34.594
Let's just say it was
a very full week.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.728
And before we knew it,

21:35.762 --> 21:37.697
it was the day
of Zukov's party.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.732
Today's the day.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.836
I wouldn't have
minded another week.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.674
You ready?

21:53.680 --> 21:54.714
What?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.483
(laughs)

21:56.516 --> 21:58.585
Nothing.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.753
You just look...

22:05.592 --> 22:07.727
Hey, strange question:

22:07.760 --> 22:11.764
You sure we want
to take these?

22:11.798 --> 22:14.000
We've had a fun week.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.702
More than fun.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.439
What if we just...

22:19.472 --> 22:22.074
tried to live,
you know, and forgot all this?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.778
Be like normal people.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.947
Together?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.749
Yeah.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.752
It has been fun.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.686
But it hasn't been real.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.656
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.658
I'm pretty sure
we were both there.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.892
(sighs)

22:39.926 --> 22:42.495
We got seven days to
pretend we live in a world

22:42.529 --> 22:44.631
where neither of us got
sucked into any of this.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.832
But we did.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.567
And it's nice to
imagine going back

22:47.600 --> 22:48.968
to the way things
were before.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.970
But you can't.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.672
Neither of us can.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.873
Not really.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.845
(sighs)

23:13.793 --> 23:15.027
There's a bigger picture here,

23:15.061 --> 23:17.096
and it matters
more than either of us.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.733
NZT, it's gonna
change everything,

23:20.767 --> 23:24.036
and you and me, we get a say
in whether that's a good thing

23:24.070 --> 23:25.605
or a disaster.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.076
You matter now.

23:30.109 --> 23:34.046
That's hard, but you can't
walk away from this.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.983
(exhales)

23:37.016 --> 23:38.951
Ever since I started
taking these pills,

23:38.985 --> 23:42.722
everyone's told me
that I'm through

23:42.755 --> 23:46.058
making my own choices.

23:46.092 --> 23:50.763
Whatever we did off of NZT,
whatever we felt off of NZT,

23:50.797 --> 23:52.999
we were lesser versions
of ourselves.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.967
We have to
be rational,

23:55.001 --> 23:56.936
and love has
no place in that.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.072
This is the real me, Brian.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.443
And the real me needs...
the real you.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.551
Davai.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.727
*

24:24.163 --> 24:26.165
BRIAN: After a week
in a two-room flat

24:26.198 --> 24:27.366
on Bolshoy Prospekt,

24:27.399 --> 24:30.202
the combination of NZT
with the palace of an oligarch

24:30.236 --> 24:32.204
made everything seem
a little heightened.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.573
(woman laughing loudly)

24:40.046 --> 24:41.981
(man speaking Russian
over earpiece)

24:42.014 --> 24:44.684
You good?

24:44.717 --> 24:45.985
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.087
It's just been a minute.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.723
Well, focus
on the plan.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.625
First, we need to
get eyes on Zukov.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.061
There's no guarantee
he didn't see my face,

24:55.094 --> 24:57.063
so we need to keep
him good and away

24:57.096 --> 24:58.965
while I do what I do.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.067
Quick question
while we do that:

25:01.100 --> 25:02.569
Why is it...

25:02.602 --> 25:04.070
No, thank you.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.072
...every time someone
takes enough NZT,

25:06.105 --> 25:08.007
they're always talking
about "the greater good"?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.276
(sighs)
Because...

25:10.309 --> 25:12.111
the pills give
you perspective.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.680
And you don't think
I have that.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.047
Maybe you start from
a different baseline

25:15.081 --> 25:16.282
than the rest of us.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.817
Pretty sure you just
called me dumb,

25:17.850 --> 25:19.185
but I'm gonna ignore that.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.052
Food for thought:

25:20.086 --> 25:22.254
What if I'm right
and you're wrong?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.591
Spasibo.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.859
'Cause you know
who you sound like

25:26.893 --> 25:28.661
when you talk about
sacrificing good things--

25:28.695 --> 25:30.129
things that are
real right now--

25:30.162 --> 25:32.231
on the altar of some
hypothetical better future?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.100
You sound like him.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.135
You sound like Morra.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.238
Could you stay
in character, please?

25:39.271 --> 25:42.141
MAN:
Mr. and Mrs. McMahon?

25:42.174 --> 25:43.910
Yes.

25:43.943 --> 25:47.279
Mr. Zukov has been very eagerly
anticipating your arrival.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.681
Has he?

25:51.751 --> 25:54.253
You wanted to see me?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.723
Vacation request?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.157
Excuse me?

25:58.190 --> 26:01.728
You have taken exactly
one and a half sick days

26:01.761 --> 26:03.095
since you've been here
at the CJC,

26:03.129 --> 26:04.797
and we practically
had to remove you

26:04.831 --> 26:06.866
from the building
for the half day.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.202
Well, that was for...
allergies, and...

26:10.236 --> 26:12.672
Yeah, and now, suddenly,
you're requesting a vacation

26:12.705 --> 26:14.073
of "indeterminate length."

26:14.106 --> 26:15.374
Is that even a thing?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.076
You know, Rebecca,

26:17.109 --> 26:19.245
we have every available

26:19.278 --> 26:21.180
intelligence asset
looking for Brian.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.181
On the ground, in the sky.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.384
We have satellites
orbiting the planet, Rebecca.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.219
What exactly are
you planning to do

26:27.253 --> 26:30.623
on this "vacation"
to look for Finch

26:30.657 --> 26:32.258
that we're not already doing?

26:32.291 --> 26:35.261
I just feel like
if I were actively looking,

26:35.294 --> 26:37.296
then at least I would
be doing something.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.298
You are doing something here.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.768
You're needed here.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.404
Everybody that's
looking for Brian,

26:45.437 --> 26:47.373
they don't...

26:47.406 --> 26:49.308
know him.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.144
He's just another
file to them.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.813
They don't have to look
his family in the eye

26:53.846 --> 26:56.248
and tell them that he's gone
and we don't know where.

26:56.282 --> 27:00.019
I'm guessing the Finch family
weren't exactly helpful.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.254
"Helpful," no.

27:02.288 --> 27:06.025
That is... not the word
I would use.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.930
His father blamed me
for this, and...

27:12.932 --> 27:14.333
...I don't think he's wrong.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.435
It's not the first time

27:16.468 --> 27:17.804
that I've seen this behavior.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.238
Unstable, erratic,

27:19.271 --> 27:21.273
he tries to keep
a handle on things,

27:21.307 --> 27:24.176
and then they get worse,
and all of a sudden, he's gone.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.014
I've seen how this plays out,
and it does not end well.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.183
Rebecca, whatever
Dennis Finch said to you,

27:31.217 --> 27:33.185
this is not your fault.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.323
And I promise you,

27:37.356 --> 27:40.159
we are going to bring
Brian home.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.765
If you want to go,
I won't stop you.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.800
Thank you.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.839
It's not every day
that we have the opportunity

27:52.872 --> 27:56.909
to entertain the horticulture
tsar and tsarina of Chicago.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.277
That's us.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.813
Mr. Zukov! May I present...

28:00.847 --> 28:03.049
Benjamin and Olivia McMahon.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.817
What an honor

28:04.851 --> 28:06.986
and pleasure
to have you in my home.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.321
Well, the pleasure is
all ours, Mr. Zukov.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.356
(chuckles) Nonsense.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.891
This place is disgusting.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.425
I have become

28:13.459 --> 28:15.795
ostentatious
with my good fortune.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.996
Shameful.

28:17.029 --> 28:21.000
But in my position,
perhaps inevitable.

28:21.033 --> 28:21.934
There's nothing shameful about

28:21.968 --> 28:24.070
celebrating beautiful things,
Mr. Zukov.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.972
Mrs. McMahon,

28:26.005 --> 28:27.807
through her foundation,

28:27.840 --> 28:30.843
has planted
philanthropic gardens

28:30.877 --> 28:33.479
all across the blighted
inner city of Chicago.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.081
Yes.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.817
Mr. Zukov, I noticed

28:37.850 --> 28:39.886
the silene tomentosa
in the foyer.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.888
Did you cultivate them yourself?

28:41.921 --> 28:43.790
Mmm.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.325
Gibraltar Campion.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.994
Extraordinarily rare.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.161
Yes.

28:49.195 --> 28:54.934
You have an exquisitely
trained eye, moya dorogaya.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.403
You have an extraordinary
collection.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.243
Hey, is that
a balalaika?

29:06.212 --> 29:08.380
ZUKOV:
It was my grandfather's.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.549
Are you a musician,

29:10.582 --> 29:12.018
Mr. McMahon?

29:12.051 --> 29:14.020
I dabble.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.021
Mm.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.188
May I?

29:16.222 --> 29:17.289
Please.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.325
(piano continues playing)

29:21.360 --> 29:23.362
He's not allergic
to attention either.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.365
May I have a look
at your plants while he...?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.300
Of course.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.803
PIPER:
Excuse me.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.205
(Brian strumming balalaika,
piano stops)

29:33.239 --> 29:35.374
(playing Slavic melody)

29:47.920 --> 29:50.322
(music continues in distance)

29:50.356 --> 29:51.323
(beeping)

29:51.357 --> 29:52.358
(lock clicks)

29:55.194 --> 29:57.196
(door closes)

30:01.934 --> 30:03.435
(people clapping rhythmically
to music)

30:10.442 --> 30:12.011
(beeping)

30:19.185 --> 30:20.352
ZUKOV:
That is Kalinka!

30:20.386 --> 30:22.421
Amazing that he knows that.
(chuckles)

30:36.435 --> 30:38.104
You've lost your way?

30:39.471 --> 30:41.140
My wallet was stolen.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.175
Will I find it on you?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.944
I'll save you the search.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.516
(crowd cheering)

30:51.918 --> 30:53.552
Hey!

30:54.954 --> 30:56.422
(playing rapidly)

31:11.703 --> 31:13.872
(screams)

31:32.724 --> 31:35.928
(speaks Russian)

31:40.532 --> 31:42.534
(music, rhythmic clapping
continues)

32:08.327 --> 32:10.196
BRIAN:
Okay, not really.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.364
It just seemed
like a really long time.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.733
Also, the outside
of wherever I was being held

32:14.766 --> 32:16.435
probably didn't look like that.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.337
Honestly, I never saw.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.174
They arrested me and took me
to some guy's office,

32:22.208 --> 32:23.309
and he told me,

32:23.342 --> 32:25.644
"Maybe you work for the FBI
like you say you do

32:25.677 --> 32:27.746
"and maybe you don't,
but either way,

32:27.779 --> 32:30.016
"we are holding you
as an enemy of the state.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.384
"So have fun and don't expect
official charges

32:32.418 --> 32:34.686
for a trial anytime soon."

32:34.720 --> 32:36.688
I think probably about
a day and a half went by

32:36.722 --> 32:39.391
before anyone else
talked to me.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.427
(shouting in Russian)

32:43.729 --> 32:46.665
I'm sorry.
I... don't understand.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.367
I told you to leave Russia.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.636
Nikolai Zukov
is asking questions

32:50.669 --> 32:53.205
about the release
of your friend, the girl.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.673
I won't say anything.

32:54.706 --> 32:58.010
Is that the same as your promise
to leave the country, hmm?

32:59.245 --> 33:01.580
It's easier for me
if all this goes away.

33:01.613 --> 33:05.084
It's easier for me
if yo go away.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.552
Understand?

33:08.754 --> 33:11.457
You will die in custody.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.592
Fight with one of the prisoners.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.627
That is
the official story.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.351
(grunting)

33:43.522 --> 33:45.524
You're making
a mistake.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.207
You came back.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.242
Actually, I never left.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.476
(chuckles)

34:04.510 --> 34:06.245
BRIAN:
She was about to.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.247
She was almost out the door
when she realized,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.648
"I can't leave Brian here."

34:09.681 --> 34:11.117
So she took her last NZT pill

34:11.150 --> 34:12.551
to figure out
a way to get me out.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.820
And with one quick phone call
to George R.R. Martin,

34:14.853 --> 34:17.456
Maxim Lavrov already knew
the ending to Game of Thrones,

34:17.489 --> 34:18.790
but Piper realized,
"You can't let

34:18.824 --> 34:20.559
anyone else know
what happened."

34:20.592 --> 34:22.361
So she had
George R.R. Martin say,

34:22.394 --> 34:24.496
"I will tell the whole world
that you took a bribe."

34:24.530 --> 34:26.165
George threw in an offer
to name a clan

34:26.198 --> 34:28.267
after a relative
of Maxim's choosing.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.102
Piper used
her last few hours on NZT

34:30.136 --> 34:31.803
to make some
new travel documents for us.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.607
And here we are.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.742
Why wouldn't you just leave?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.644
Isn't that
the smarter thing to do?

34:39.878 --> 34:41.547
I don't know.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.185
Maybe I spent too much time
thinking about the future.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.521
Maybe I need to pay attention

34:49.555 --> 34:51.657
to the things
that are here right now.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.661
(indistinct radio transmission)

34:59.698 --> 35:01.400
(speaks Russian)

35:01.433 --> 35:02.801
We'll stay.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.171
Make sure you both
leave tomorrow.

35:12.644 --> 35:16.282
I'm gonna be in so much trouble
when I go back.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.619
Do you want to come with me?

35:20.652 --> 35:24.323
I thought none of this was real.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.558
I guess if I really
believed that,

35:26.592 --> 35:29.328
I would've left you here.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.830
Brian, when I think
about the future,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.633
it's... big.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.634
Who has the drug?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.403
What are they
doing with it?

35:37.436 --> 35:40.206
And I'm not gonna stop
asking those questions.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.807
But within that, maybe I can

35:41.840 --> 35:45.444
think a little more
about... myself,

35:45.477 --> 35:48.580
where I am, who I'm with.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.549
Yeah.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.951
Neither of us can go back
to the way things were before,

35:52.984 --> 35:56.688
but maybe we can make
the way things are...

35:56.722 --> 35:58.257
better.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.594
It's tempting.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.962
(chuckles)

36:03.995 --> 36:06.598
I can't go back to the States.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.767
Sands and Morra think I'm dead.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.937
Well, I wish I could
come with you, but...

36:11.970 --> 36:13.605
I came after you so I could

36:13.639 --> 36:16.675
stop betraying the people
that I care about.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.977
Not so I could get away
from them forever.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.879
I'm almost done
with the shot.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.782
I just need a week,
maybe more.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.786
And when I'm done,
I'll find you.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.861
(crickets chirping)

36:37.929 --> 36:39.931
(phone chimes)

36:41.767 --> 36:43.269
(sighs)

36:43.302 --> 36:44.836
(mumbling):
Okay, money transfer.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.872
Do the thing.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.916
Yes, I understand that there's
a penalty to change the flight.

36:57.949 --> 37:01.887
And I'll pay it, I just...
I don't know when I'm traveling.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.422
Or if.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.656
So can we just...?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.294
Thank you.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.329
I appreciate it.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.400
Excuse me, Agent Harris?

37:14.433 --> 37:16.335
Yeah, Rachel, right?

37:16.368 --> 37:17.803
Mm-hmm.
You can call me Rebecca.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.706
Uh, I'm not even sure
I should be here right now.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.742
My dad doesn't want
me to talk to you.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.778
But Brian's been
gone so long, and...

37:26.812 --> 37:28.747
you're the one
he's been e-mailing.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.949
So he must trust you.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.251
I think he does.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.390
Is there someplace we can go?

37:38.424 --> 37:41.660
I'm ready to talk about
what happened that night.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.799
(exhales)

37:47.833 --> 37:50.736
(phone ringing)

37:50.769 --> 37:52.771
REBECCA (recorded): Hi, you've
reached Rebecca Harris.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.806
Please leave a message and
I'll get back to you shortly.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.742
Hey, it's me. It's Brian.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.444
I'm coming back.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.379
Not exactly sure
what's waiting for me there,

38:00.412 --> 38:01.680
but I'm coming back.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.715
I think things have a shot
at being better now,

38:03.749 --> 38:04.983
and if there's any way

38:05.016 --> 38:06.485
we can work together,
I want that.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.654
You have no idea
how much I want that.

38:08.687 --> 38:09.588
And he was big.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.790
At least a couple inches
taller than Brian.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.525
And a shaved head.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.994
Thick British accent.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.468
Look, you saw something in me.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.404
A reason why you asked me
to come work with you.

38:25.437 --> 38:26.838
Well, it's still there.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.774
I promise.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.810
Is that him?

38:31.843 --> 38:33.779
Yeah.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.947
That's him.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.594
I don't care what Sasha says.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.829
That girl has no idea
what she's talking about.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.864
I know things.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.737
Barry Manilow did not write
the song he sings.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.539
I write the songs.

39:00.572 --> 39:04.376
A pig's orgasm can last
11 to 40 minutes.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.779
When you walk, your head moves
faster than your body.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.115
An octopus has three hearts.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.518
Black holes aren't really black.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.753
Quantum mechanics theorizes
that there is

39:14.786 --> 39:18.089
unlimited number of universes,
which means there is

39:18.123 --> 39:20.859
infinite amount of mes
making this talk

39:20.892 --> 39:23.662
and infinite amount
of yous listening.

39:23.695 --> 39:28.734
Think about that.
