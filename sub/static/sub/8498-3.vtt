<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:38.400 --> 00:40.675
<i>Not everyone
in Poplar was moving</i>

00:40.760 --> 00:43.115
<i>to the brand new homes in the sky.</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:48.359
<i>Countless streets and tenements
were still home to sprawling,</i>

00:48.440 --> 00:50.317
<i>close-knit families...</i>

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
Angie?

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Can you do me a favour?

00:53.160 --> 00:56.516
<i>Whose roots were deeply sunk
in East End soil.</i>

00:58.040 --> 01:02.158
<i>They preferred to do without
more modern conveniences,</i>

01:02.240 --> 01:05.152
<i>in favour of a place where
the neighbours were cousins,</i>

01:05.239 --> 01:07.879
<i>in-laws, siblings, aunts.</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:11.035
I'm desperate. I need to. I need to.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.677
Yeah, it's clean. In you go.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.350
<i>Where no door was locked.</i>

01:23.440 --> 01:29.037
<i>Where each house held familiar comfort
and the reassurance of a loving touch.</i>

01:29.160 --> 01:30.798
<i>They felt so safe.</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:32.195
Go on, then.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.028
Go on, then. Help yourself.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
Take that 'round to Stan.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.800
Go on. Hurry up or
you're going to be late.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.756
That's it, Jeanette. Big push.
You can do it.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.633
No, I can't.
I can't. Tell her, Nan, make her...

02:03.720 --> 02:05.438
Of course you can, love.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.114
Now, I can't wait to meet
my first great grandchild.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.839
Gah! Oh.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.475
I have your baby's head.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.870
Now I need another one,
just like that.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.396
Well done, Jeanette.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.191
Well done. It's a beautiful girl.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.078
It's a little girl, Cath.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.675
It's a girl.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.392
Our Jeanette's had a little girl, Stan.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.510
- That's me a great grandma now.
- Bloody hell.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.993
Not another one of you lot.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.480
Are you not eating that?

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
No, I'm a bit off.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.793
You got any syrup or figs over there?

03:17.880 --> 03:18.880
Oh, I'll have a look.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.616
Maybe you'll feel hungry
by lunchtime, eh?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.675
Yeah.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.988
Hey, Meg.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.711
Lovely, about the baby.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.549
Auntie Meg.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.240
What's it look like?

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
The baby.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.708
Is it... Well, you know.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.271
"She" is beautiful.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.996
And she looks like my
great granddaughter.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.160
Do you have a name for her?

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Marina.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.351
'Cause her daddy
had to cross the sea to find us.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.758
Well, I said it must be after the water
in the lime-house basin.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.319
I've been here since I was six.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.518
You're an old romantic, ain't you girl.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.549
Everyone sends their love.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.996
Even old Stan nearly cracked a smile.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.874
You ready for a sandwich yet?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.276
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't eat a thing.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.796
Must be lovely having everyone
so close by.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.240
Do you know what, Nurse, it is.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.635
You don't get that
in them fancy new flats, do you?

04:24.120 --> 04:27.556
I'm 63 years old and I've never spent
a day on my own in my life.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.196
Wouldn't want to neither, would I?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.751
It's Marina Margaret, nana Meg.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.919
Middle name's after you.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.960
Hello. Long night?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.872
Not really. Mrs Lovell's ninth.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.237
Morning! Oh!

04:51.360 --> 04:52.509
Morning, Sister.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.789
Do you need a hand?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.836
Oh, I have a little helper waiting.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.799
Thank you, Irene.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.154
Are you off on your rounds?

05:02.800 --> 05:05.320
I'm actually going to collect
my ill-gotten gains from gambling.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.070
The vicar's wife sold me a ticket
to the WI raffle, and I appear

05:09.400 --> 05:12.472
to have won a meal in an
Indian restaurant in the West End.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.478
- Oh.
- Rather embarrassing, actually.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.710
No. Lucky you.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.073
Gosh, how exotic. We were given
some Indian food once by a patient.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.510
- I'm rather jealous.
- Well, come with me then.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.629
- It's a table for two.
- Me?

05:28.480 --> 05:30.456
Unless you didn't like
the food the patient brought.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.789
No, no. It was delicious, er...

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
Well, that's arranged.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
Erm...

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
What was it?

05:47.840 --> 05:49.398
Oh. A boy.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.589
Enjoy your day off.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.960
I will.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.919
That's it, 'round and 'round.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.520
Got it? Is that all right?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.716
What do we say to Sister Winifred?

06:21.160 --> 06:24.470
Thank you, Sister Winifred.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.909
Thank you for all your hard work.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.189
Class dismissed.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.397
You're so good with them.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.796
You must have made a marvellous teacher.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.560
Oh, I think that
would be overstating it.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.230
But I did enjoy the work.
As do you, I can tell.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.349
Do you miss it? Sorry.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.156
- It's rather personal.
- Well...

06:50.280 --> 06:52.555
I have no regrets
about the path I chose.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.589
But I have to admit,
this time with the children is lovely.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.072
Of course, midwifery is
all about children, too.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Oh, Miss Whitmore.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.076
I feel very silly. I probably
just stood up too quickly.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.278
Possibly, but your pulse
is still rather rapid.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.351
Is it your monthly period by any chance?

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
No.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.913
- Your cycle is regular?
- Usually.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.512
Maybe a little off recently.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.232
Happens sometimes.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.957
Oh, you are slightly clammy. May I?

07:31.280 --> 07:32.633
Oh, oh!

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
Here you go.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.309
God, how embarrassing.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.795
Probably picked something up
off one of the children.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.439
You know what it's like.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.552
Is this happening a lot, Miss Whitmore?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.670
Once or twice. It's nothing.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.719
Miss Whitmore, when you said
your cycle was irregular,

08:04.160 --> 08:07.630
did you mean your periods were late
or more frequent or...

08:08.480 --> 08:10.789
Not happening at all?

08:15.440 --> 08:16.714
The last one...

08:17.680 --> 08:22.037
Miss Whitmore, I'm sorry,
but you understand I have to ask.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.398
Is there any chance at all that

08:27.040 --> 08:28.678
you might be pregnant?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.192
Oh, dear.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.034
Hello, Fred.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.153
Oh, no.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.999
Everything all right, Sister?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.672
I was hoping for Fred.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.119
Someone has to tell him to bring some
more of his wife's homemade jam.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.478
It all seems
to have disappeared.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.196
I just saw him.
I'm sure he won't be long.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.432
Well, I hope not.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.277
It's quite small, I know,
but I hope you'll be happy here.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.712
I certainly was.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.673
It's perfect. Thank you.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Hello.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.754
Uh, I saw the bags.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.119
I'm afraid there's quite
a lot to tidy away.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.354
Oh, well, luckily that's my forte.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.957
I'm sorry, I can see
that this has come as a shock

09:46.600 --> 09:49.672
and I expect you'll want some time
to discuss this with your, er...

09:50.080 --> 09:51.080
Your fiancé.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.676
- In the meantime...
- He isn't my fiancé.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.189
That won't affect
the care you get from us.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.838
I'm going to give you

10:01.080 --> 10:03.196
some iron tablets

10:03.400 --> 10:06.312
but, otherwise, I'm pleased to say,

10:07.280 --> 10:09.635
things look very healthy.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.640
Thank you.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.432
Oh! I'm so stupid.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.429
I know it isn't ideal,

10:23.680 --> 10:25.477
but we're here to help you.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.833
Please don't tell anyone at school.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.593
I would never reveal
a patient's private information.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.674
But...

10:34.720 --> 10:37.280
You're going to have to give
them a reason

10:38.880 --> 10:40.233
for leaving.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.233
Miss Whitmore,

10:43.840 --> 10:46.354
even a married lady
wouldn't be allowed to continue teaching

10:46.440 --> 10:48.556
if she were expecting. You know that.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.077
And in your situation,
it would be quite impossible.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.911
But I need to work.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.072
And I love my job.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.072
I'm sure,
when you talk to your boyfriend,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.037
he'll want to do the right thing.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.236
It really doesn't have to be
the end of the world.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
He's married.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
Oh.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.151
You must be exhausted now.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.430
I must be. I don't feel it.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.680
There.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.269
I've waited such a long time
to sit beside you

11:32.360 --> 11:34.271
looking at a bunch of flowers in a vase.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.315
Under the same roof, at last.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.239
Just you and me.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.508
And Trixie, and...

11:42.840 --> 11:45.752
Barbara and Nurse Crane...

11:45.960 --> 11:50.431
And quite a few nuns.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.951
It's a beautiful dress.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
Thank you.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.390
I didn't need it, of course,
but I couldn't resist.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.031
I haven't exactly been
a social butterfly

12:06.120 --> 12:07.599
since I broke it off with Tom.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.920
I think I'm turning into
a middle-aged spinster.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
No.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.357
A fate worse than death, I'm sure.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.440
Oh, I didn't mean...

12:18.200 --> 12:21.590
I just occasionally feel as though
I'm destined never to go out again.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.109
Of course you will.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.635
I know that really.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.789
Do you ever...

12:29.120 --> 12:31.509
Do you ever wish you hadn't
broken it off with Tom?

12:33.640 --> 12:34.789
No.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.758
We're much better suited as friends

12:36.840 --> 12:38.840
and hopefully we'll both find
other people one day.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.434
Of course you will, Trixie.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
Hmm.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.040
There.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.995
You look absolutely wonderful.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.475
Miss Whitmore?

12:57.040 --> 12:58.758
Is everything all right?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.991
Yes. Fine. Thank you.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.311
Sorry, Mrs Tucker, I won't be long.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.358
I hope not, young lady.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.114
That lovely fried egg
is congealing on the plate.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.989
Midwife.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.633
Oh, Nurse, I'm so glad you're here.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.679
Oh, don't come in, Benny.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.193
It's Nurse Mount, Jeanette.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.416
How long has she been like this?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.476
Started feeling poorly early hours.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.632
I called the doctor
and she's on the list

13:44.720 --> 13:46.039
but I think she's getting worse.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.235
An infection, maybe.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.996
Sometimes they develop
a few days after giving birth.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
Oh, Nana!

13:53.840 --> 13:55.319
- What is it?
- Go away!

13:55.880 --> 13:58.030
Nana, I don't want him
to see me like this.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.758
Don't worry, love, I'll sort it.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.391
I'll give him something to do.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.470
All right, Stan?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.393
What are you doing here?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.920
- I brought you something.
- Oh, I ain't hungry.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.030
Oh, come on, you've got to
keep your strength up.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.709
Pass me my teeth, then.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.198
Just try to take a sip.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.389
Just a little.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.115
She's very dehydrated, Mrs Mahoney.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.920
I don't think we can wait for Dr Turner.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.280
What's she doing with her hands?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.910
Mrs Mahoney, could you
go call an ambulance, please?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.400
Look, it's early.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.880
It might not, you know, happen.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.671
I'm sorry, but it's true, isn't it?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.675
Sometimes, if you have the money,

15:21.560 --> 15:24.916
there are things that you can,
you know, do.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.035
What are you saying?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.029
Send me to some butcher in a back alley?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.838
No. Not like that, of course not.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.393
A proper doctor.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.360
I've heard that on Harley Street
there were...

15:38.720 --> 15:39.914
You know.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
Do you...

15:44.920 --> 15:46.069
Have the money?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.199
I expect not.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.155
No.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.759
Neither do I.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.400
You were wearing that dress
the first day I met you.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.515
I know.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.514
I have to get back.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.797
My upper sixth have an exam.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.714
Jeremy.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.557
We still love each other, don't we?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.269
Of course.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.793
You have a beautiful daughter, Mr Su.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.312
And I'm delighted to say,

16:44.560 --> 16:46.357
she seems absolutely healthy.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.479
What's she gonna do without her mum?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.916
I know it must be very worrying

16:52.160 --> 16:54.435
but I'm sure they'll find out why
your wife is sick

16:54.600 --> 16:56.636
and get her home
to you as soon as they can.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.312
In the meantime,
you are both in expert hands.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.394
Mrs Maloney has cared for
a lot of babies.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.438
Well, I certainly have, Doctor.
We'll be all right, love.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.117
I'll take that key, thank you.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.640
What?

17:26.839 --> 17:28.239
You went through my things.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.356
This is a respectable establishment,
Miss Whitmore.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.478
I've just paid next month's rent.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.880
Which will serve and give notice.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.656
Mrs Tucker, I don't have enough money.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.600
I'm sure your gentleman friend
will help you out.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.429
You should be ashamed of yourself,
you little madam.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.070
So should you, Mrs Tucker.
At least I'm not a thief.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.796
I think you should ask Sister Julienne

18:00.920 --> 18:03.753
to take you off all the midwifery duties
until we know what this is.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.318
If it's what you suspect,

18:06.480 --> 18:08.789
then we want to minimise
the chance of contamination.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.469
I will.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.158
I hope I'm wrong.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.356
The only time I've seen
those pink spots,

18:16.240 --> 18:18.151
that plucking movement on the sheets,

18:18.720 --> 18:21.075
was with my mother and sister
in the prison camp.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.629
Typhoid.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.037
We say nothing until we know for sure.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.677
No sense in spreading panic,

18:28.760 --> 18:29.760
but we should be ready.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.755
It's Dorothy.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.635
I'm sorry to call you at home,
but I need...

18:47.720 --> 18:49.800
<i>I'm sorry, Madame,
I think you have the wrong number.</i>

18:50.880 --> 18:53.030
Jeremy, I know you can't talk,
but listen...

18:53.120 --> 18:55.156
<i>Quite all right. Goodbye.</i>

18:55.240 --> 18:56.355
Jeremy, please.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.074
I mean, it's not going-out going out,
I'm sure.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.197
It's just he's won a meal in a raffle
and he's got to take someone.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.269
It's just, I don't want to upset Trixie.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.992
Best thing you can do

19:23.080 --> 19:25.833
is to tell her straight out
just like you told me.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.316
In my experience,

19:28.560 --> 19:31.393
it's the withholding of information
that could lead to

19:31.960 --> 19:33.234
misunderstanding.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.514
I expect you're right.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.309
How do you know it isn't
going-out going out?

19:40.520 --> 19:42.670
Well, I don't... I don't think it...

19:43.480 --> 19:46.074
I think if it wasn't,
you might not be so concerned.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.116
Look at these beauties.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.795
Summer on a little green stalk.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.314
Hmm. Delicious, Fred.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.760
I'll pick you some, Mr Hereward.
Oh, and I got you this.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.669
My Violet's strawberry jam.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.032
Nectar of the gods.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.957
If she'd let me sell it,
I'd make a fortune.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.038
And don't tell Sister Monica Joan.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.320
Are you sure
you can spare all this, Fred?

20:14.600 --> 20:17.068
You could do with feeding up.
Unlike myself.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.960
Married life's wonderful,
but good for the waistline, it ain't.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.576
Well, you seem to be thriving on it.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.989
Yeah, I'm in the pink.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.031
Do you know what?
I never thought I'd re-marry.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.075
I always thought
you had one chance at it and that's it.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.351
Then you see someone that's been there
all the time and, bingo.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
Funny old world, innit?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.229
It is.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.554
Hey, Mr Hereward,
I've got a bone to pick with you.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.790
I hear you won a meal up the West End
in a WI raffle. I was after that.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.816
If you'd have asked me
a couple of days ago, Fred,

20:52.840 --> 20:54.512
you could have had it, and welcome.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.679
But I'm afraid I've asked Nurse Gilbert
to come along.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
Huh.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.519
Well, I never.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.838
If it is typhoid,

21:16.920 --> 21:19.480
we have the list of registered carriers
at the surgery.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.038
No one else in the family seems ill?

21:22.560 --> 21:24.551
Not as far as I know.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.036
But the extended family is huge.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.514
Patsy, even if you're right,

21:29.600 --> 21:32.068
the antibiotic treatment now
is really effective.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.718
Typhoid isn't like it was...

21:34.800 --> 21:35.800
I know that Delia.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.117
I'm talking about
the prevention of spread.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.199
Who wants toast?

21:48.120 --> 21:50.759
Actually, I think I'm going to go
and read my book.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.709
Patsy.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.679
That was really rude.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.712
Poor Delia was only trying to help.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
I know.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.798
If I had had a rotten day like yours
I expect I'd be touchy too.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.391
Have some of Violet's jam before
Sister Monica Joan gets her hands on it.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.480
Then go and say sorry
to our new housemate.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.189
Miss Whitmore.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.512
Sorry, Sister, I...

22:24.520 --> 22:26.397
I didn't know where else to go.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.271
Sister Julienne is telephoning
the women's hostel.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.235
That's very kind.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.840
They have a place for you.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.870
It may be rather more Spartan than
you're used to but it's economical

23:07.040 --> 23:09.031
and will be safe and adequate, I'm sure.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
Thank you, Sister.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.429
I'm very grateful.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.839
You're welcome, Miss Whitmore.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.630
If you would excuse us now,
my sisters and I must go into compline.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.068
Yes, of course.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.640
I'm sorry.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.056
I knew you were thinking about
your mother and sister

25:15.080 --> 25:16.752
but I would have never mentioned them.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.834
I know how difficult it is for you
to talk about the camp.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.470
- I've been thinking about them all day.
- Of course you have.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.755
It must have brought back
so many awful memories.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.151
I so wanted to let you comfort me.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.880
But I didn't know how to do it
with the others there.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.154
Patsy, if me being here
makes you uncomfortable, I can go.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.912
- I'm sure I'd find somewhere...
- No.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.033
I don't want that. I want you here.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.992
I nearly lost you once already.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.869
But you didn't.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.439
Can I help you?

26:57.360 --> 27:00.272
I think we're on district
together this morning, Trixie.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.796
Not necessarily. There've been
one or two changes this morning.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.070
And I've been talking with Dr Turner.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.278
I'm afraid Mrs Su's typhoid diagnosis
has been confirmed by the London.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
Oh, no.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.800
Nurse Mount,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.736
you did exceptionally well in getting
her to the hospital when you did.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.716
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you, Sister Julia.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.319
As you've already been exposed,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.496
you'll continue to work
with Dr Turner and the family.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.990
And you'll be removed from other
midwifery duties as a precaution.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.152
- Yes, Sister.
- Sister.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.831
The other residents of the Croxwood
buildings will need to be informed.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.279
Of course, Sister.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.795
This is all very worrying, of course.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.076
But if we identify the source quickly

27:40.200 --> 27:43.078
I have high hopes that this will remain
an isolated case.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.159
- Nurse Crane.
- Thank you, Sister.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.196
Nurse Gilbert, home visits.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.752
Nurse Franklin, you are on district,
as expected.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.919
Come on, hurry up.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.235
Yes. Yes, sorry.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.958
Sister?

28:12.480 --> 28:14.360
Now that Miss Whitmore
is at the women's hostel,

28:14.440 --> 28:15.920
we're no longer her nearest practice.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.120
Should I send her records on?

28:17.640 --> 28:19.278
Has she requested that we do?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.714
I just thought that
with Sister Evangelina away

28:22.800 --> 28:26.156
and Nurse Mount unable to take midwifery
cases, it might, well...

28:26.880 --> 28:27.915
Ease the load a little.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.790
Is something troubling you, Sister?

28:32.520 --> 28:36.035
I noticed last night that you were
a little more subdued than usual.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.435
- Sorry.
- It's not a criticism.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.792
I know that we're here to help
without judgement, but...

28:49.160 --> 28:52.072
I'm struggling to do so
in Miss Whitmore's case.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.277
You've dealt with
unmarried mothers before.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.993
And with great compassion.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.314
They were...

29:01.280 --> 29:02.872
Less like me.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.792
To be a teacher is a privilege

29:09.080 --> 29:11.878
and a great responsibility, and to

29:12.520 --> 29:17.594
have an affair with a married man is...

29:17.680 --> 29:19.432
An error of judgement?

29:20.120 --> 29:22.236
For which she is paying a heavy price.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.197
Rather heavier, I imagine, than that
paid by the gentleman involved.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.439
Yes, Sister Julienne.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.592
Your loyalty to your former profession
is laudable, Sister,

29:32.880 --> 29:35.519
but remember, you're no longer
a teacher, you're a midwife.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.637
Therefore, Miss Whitmore

29:39.040 --> 29:40.632
is simply a mother.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.594
- Oh!
- Miss Whitmore!

29:58.840 --> 29:59.875
Yes.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.269
Yes, I'm here. Come on, sit back down.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.509
Sit back down.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.715
Miss Whitmore.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.436
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, Mrs Dawkins.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.515
Could you go and wait outside my office,
please? Miss Lewis will mind your class.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
Thank you.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.038
Mr Roberts.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.350
It's Sister Mary Cynthia,
District Nurse.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.354
Stan?

30:38.960 --> 30:40.359
They won't even let me see her.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.596
I'm afraid when something
is this infectious,

30:42.680 --> 30:44.033
patients are kept in isolation.

30:44.320 --> 30:49.030
I mean, typhoid, I thought that went out
with the Ark. Or at least with the war.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.157
It is unusual nowadays,
in this country, at any rate.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.354
Mrs Su must have
eaten or drunk something

30:55.520 --> 30:57.590
infected by a carrier of the bacteria.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.318
Poor Jeanette.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.837
Typhoid doesn't have to mean
what it once did, Mrs Mahoney,

31:03.040 --> 31:05.634
- not with these new medicines.
- Exactly, Nurse Mount.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.519
However, it is a serious illness

31:08.680 --> 31:11.592
and we want to prevent it spreading
to anyone else, if we can.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.275
We'll be keeping a close eye
on the rest of you

31:14.360 --> 31:18.273
while we try to find out where Mrs Su
might have picked the infection up.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.470
There is a blood test I can run,

31:21.680 --> 31:24.877
which will let us know if
the bacteria is likely to be present.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.336
In the meantime, the best thing
you can do to protect yourselves

31:27.360 --> 31:29.954
is to be extremely careful
about washing your hands

31:30.040 --> 31:32.156
after using the lavatory
and before touching food.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.309
That's it? That's the best you've got?

31:35.520 --> 31:39.399
"Wash your hands" in 1961
for a killer disease.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.550
Give it a rest, Angie.
It ain't killing anyone.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.551
- Weren't you listening?
- Yeah, I was.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.956
He said we don't hardly
get typhoid in England.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.736
It's probably you what infected her.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.480
God knows what you lot
brought in with them.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.676
- I think everybody...
- Benny, stay where you are.

31:53.360 --> 31:56.400
I don't want to hear another crack like
that come out of your mouth, my girl.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.590
Benny is family and that's not
how we treat family, not in my house.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.793
So, you apologise to him
or get out, now.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
Sorry, Benny.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.996
This family always
faces things together.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.239
If we don't, everything falls apart.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.431
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.116
Dr Turner, could I borrow you
for a moment, please?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.599
Yes, of course, sister.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.679
Poor Stan.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.277
Two pink spots on his abdomen.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.717
Let's see what the post-mortem says.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.159
Miss Whitmore.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.469
I believe a gentleman delivered this
to Mrs Tucker's home this morning.

33:41.240 --> 33:44.198
- Mrs Tucker and I had a disagreement...
- Miss Whitmore,

33:45.040 --> 33:48.271
we expect all our staff
to be of exemplary moral character.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.716
A serious allegation has been made.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.235
I would like you to tell me
whether or not it's true.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.112
I'd rather not have to ask you
to open your letter.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.360
If I could just stay
until the end of term.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.239
It's only a few more weeks.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.753
I'm sorry, Miss Whitmore.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.878
You know that won't be possible.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.869
I have to ask you to leave
with immediate effect.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.712
Can I say goodbye to the children?

34:18.440 --> 34:20.040
I don't think that would be a good idea.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.033
Anything you can tell me about what
she ate at the time would help. So...

34:43.120 --> 34:45.156
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

34:45.239 --> 34:46.275
Did Stan have typhoid?

34:47.080 --> 34:49.469
- That's what they're all saying.
- No, love.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.438
Stan weren't like Jeanette.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.949
Stan was knocking back syrup of figs
like lemonade.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.476
I'm afraid that doesn't rule it out,
Mrs Mahoney.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.317
Typhoid is complicated.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.960
Sometimes two people can have
completely different symptoms.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.149
Do you think Angie's right?

35:03.880 --> 35:04.949
Could it be me?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.956
Do you think I picked it up
in China as a kid?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.720
I made Stan a sandwich the other day.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.633
If Mr Roberts was infected,
it wasn't just the other day.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.776
It would have been around the same time
as your wife,

35:16.800 --> 35:18.074
possibly from the same source.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.920
We've missed the lab collection.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.200
Oh, I can take them up there. I'm not
allowed to work in clinic anyway.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.553
Oh, the clinic.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.437
- Do you mind? Thank you so much.
- No.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.475
- And, can you tell them it's urgent?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.840
Can I help you?

36:54.480 --> 36:57.950
Sorry. I'm Nurse Mount.
I'm Mrs Su's midwife.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.075
How is she?

36:59.240 --> 37:02.437
We've managed to re-hydrate her
but it'll take another 24 hours

37:02.520 --> 37:04.317
for the chloramphenicol to take effect.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.837
Really, it all depends on whether
we can get her through that.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.831
What does one wear
to an Indian restaurant?

38:20.240 --> 38:22.800
Well, I don't expect you have to wear
a sari or anything.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.952
Just wear what you'd wear
to any other meal out.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.515
Well, I don't have
a lot of experience of meals out.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.069
With a man.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.192
Not any, actually.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.672
I don't really know what to do.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.550
One of the drawbacks of being
a vicar's daughter.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.750
Unless your dining companion
happens to be a vicar.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.115
Can I come in,
Trixie's out like a light.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.638
Goodness, what's going on in here?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.557
Tom won an Indian meal
in a raffle

38:56.640 --> 38:57.816
and he asked me to go with him

38:57.840 --> 38:59.576
but I haven't told Trixie yet,
so please don't.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.176
And I'm awfully worried about it
and I don't have anything to wear.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.200
Gosh.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.788
I've told her just
to be straightforward.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.474
Nothing good ever came
of keeping secrets.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.272
Did it, Nurse Mount?

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
Stop staring.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.671
Does the 15 go past the London?

39:54.320 --> 39:55.389
Yes, love.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.399
What's the matter?

40:03.440 --> 40:04.555
Are you all right?

40:05.480 --> 40:06.959
Good Lord.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.838
Here, call for an ambulance, will ya?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.711
You're all right, love.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.118
That's my teacher.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.158
I think if it was in something
processed, like corn beef,

40:24.240 --> 40:26.515
the bacteria would have had
a far wider reach by now.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.592
Have there been any family weddings
or street parties?

40:30.720 --> 40:31.835
Yes.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.992
Potato salad. Often a harbinger of doom.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.113
Sister Monica Joan,
there isn't a lot of that left.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.792
Quite.

40:42.360 --> 40:46.399
I'm sorry to disturb so early,
but I have to visit Mrs Su's family.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.996
And I wondered if I could take
Nurse Mount with me.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.475
Is there news?

40:50.680 --> 40:52.079
Not about Mrs Su herself,

40:52.960 --> 40:54.757
but it's been confirmed,

40:55.040 --> 40:57.600
Mr Roberts died of acute peritonitis

40:57.760 --> 41:00.513
as a result of
undiagnosed typhoid infection.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.317
And, the test results are back.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.870
I think we may have found our carrier.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.880
Me?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.473
The tests would suggest that.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.274
Nah. It can't be.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.714
I ain't never had typhoid.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.273
I'm afraid you have.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.916
Probably very mildly as a child.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.718
The bacteria can lie dormant
for many years.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.576
And once you know you're a carrier,
managing it is quite straightforward,

41:28.600 --> 41:30.160
just good old-fashioned soap and water.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.159
Oh, lord.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.353
Take her off me.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.556
It's all right, she's not in any danger.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.640
Take her.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.710
I need to wash my hands.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.870
- What's going on?
- Oh, Benny, I'm so sorry.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.595
What?

41:54.800 --> 41:55.835
Jeanette?

41:56.320 --> 41:58.197
I made her sick, Benny.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.038
I didn't mean to, but I did.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.520
Oh, God.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.471
I killed poor old Stan Roberts.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.594
The register of typhoid carriers exists

42:42.680 --> 42:45.478
to help control and contain
future outbreaks.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.956
I know it must feel intrusive

42:48.040 --> 42:51.510
but it is an effective way
of preventing people becoming ill.

42:51.640 --> 42:52.640
Yes.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.477
It's very important
the register is kept up to date.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.361
So, you would need to let us know
of any change of address right away.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.838
I've lived in the same flat
all my life, Mrs Turner.

43:02.920 --> 43:07.152
I know, though if you did want to move,
it could be arranged quite quickly.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.718
There's a point system for re-housing
and your carrier status

43:10.800 --> 43:11.835
would give you priority.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.959
Oh, will they make me move?

43:15.520 --> 43:16.839
Make me leave my family?

43:16.920 --> 43:18.638
Of course not, Mrs Mahoney.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.790
You've managed wonderfully well
up 'til now.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.952
There are actually very few restrictions
on typhoid carriers

43:24.280 --> 43:27.750
and most of them are just simple hygiene
and common sense.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.431
A little bunch of fuchsias, maybe.
When you meet her.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.717
Not as obvious as roses,
but still classy.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.194
The ladies like that.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.114
I'm sure Nurse Gilbert's
not thinking that way at all.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.316
I'm sure she's only interested in
the Indian food.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.393
Oh! Packet of Rennies then.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.954
Only joking. What you want
for spicy food is milk.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.393
Stops it blowing your head off.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.877
But don't have water with it,
whatever you do.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.593
It makes it worse.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.151
I learnt that the hard way,
in North Africa.

44:23.160 --> 44:26.152
Miss Whitmore was registered
with us very recently.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.473
You wished to see me, Sister?

44:28.560 --> 44:30.360
- Oh, hello, Sergeant Noakes.
- Hello, Sister.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.392
Please, sit down, Sister.

44:33.280 --> 44:37.319
I'm afraid Sergeant Noakes has some
unfortunate news about Miss Whitmore.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.873
She's in the hospital, Sister.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.831
It's believed she attempted
to abort her baby.

44:44.920 --> 44:46.319
Did she succeed?

44:46.720 --> 44:47.835
No.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.393
She had been pierced with a sharp object
causing great blood loss.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.357
She miscarried the baby
later that evening.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.756
Miss Whitmore almost didn't
survive herself.

44:56.120 --> 44:57.678
Have they performed a hysterectomy?

44:57.800 --> 44:59.028
I believe so, yes.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.760
The hospital will let us know
when she's ready to be interviewed.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.394
She's to be interviewed
by the police in hospital?

45:04.600 --> 45:06.830
We have to find out who did this
to Miss Whitmore.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.592
What if the

45:08.960 --> 45:11.190
injury was self-inflicted?

45:11.760 --> 45:12.760
Well...

45:13.520 --> 45:15.750
Offence Against the Persons Act, 1861.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.593
It's still a crime, Sister.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.638
Oh, my dear.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.392
Dear Sister Winifred.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.513
It's upsetting, I know.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.591
I am to blame.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.995
She was alone
and desperate for a friend.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.517
I knew that, Sister, and I didn't help.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.439
You did help.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.631
No.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.793
I judged.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.672
And now it's too late.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.760
But, Sister,

45:56.800 --> 46:00.236
Miss Whitmore has never had
more need of friend than now.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.076
You washed your hands five minutes ago,
Mrs Mahoney.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.951
You don't need to use a brush.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.112
It ain't hot enough.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.236
Can I have a jam sandwich, Auntie Meg?

46:19.160 --> 46:20.160
No!

46:20.720 --> 46:22.438
I told you, ask your mom.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.479
I can't do that no more.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.079
Now go away!

46:32.080 --> 46:34.878
- I feel so dirty.
- You're not dirty.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.359
Just hold her.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.638
- Please.
- I can't.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.913
When I look at her,
I see Jeanette all sick.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.232
And when I go outside,

46:46.840 --> 46:48.558
I think of Stan.

47:06.680 --> 47:07.829
Hello, love.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.674
Hello, Miss Whitmore.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.469
Hello, Sister.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.632
I brought you some of your things.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.551
I expect the room was rather a mess.

47:55.680 --> 48:00.390
Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss Whitmore.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.993
I should have helped you more.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.993
- Please don't hate me.
- Oh, of course not.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.509
Never.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.911
I'm awfully frightened, Sister.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.189
I'm here.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.198
Miss Whitmore, I'm here.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.032
Sister.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.349
I'd like to stay with her,
Sergeant Noakes.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.720
I think that would be in order.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.150
- Hello.
- Oh, a boy for Mrs Antonacci.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.873
Have you seen Trixie?

48:41.040 --> 48:42.439
Mrs Williams.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.438
Oh, no.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.868
You're cutting it rather fine,
Nurse Gilbert.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.188
I know.

48:52.400 --> 48:56.109
And I haven't had a chance to talk
to Trixie. I've left it too late.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.156
Well, never mind, can't be helped now.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.833
I've set out your things.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.749
Oh, thank you.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.916
I smell of sweat and amniotic fluid.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.994
Oh, gosh, Phyllis,
you're an absolute brick.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.676
Did you pay someone
to perform a procedure

49:35.840 --> 49:38.035
intended to result
in the abortion of your baby?

49:42.560 --> 49:43.879
You're quite sure of that?

49:44.680 --> 49:47.513
I didn't have enough money
for anything like that, Sergeant.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.996
So, when your injuries occurred
you were alone?

49:54.600 --> 49:55.874
Completely.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.358
I'm afraid you seem to have

50:03.440 --> 50:05.032
rather a lot of night shifts coming up.

50:05.440 --> 50:08.318
I don't like to do that, but with
Nurse Mount unavailable...

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
I don't mind.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.478
Needs must, I suppose.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.915
As long as I can still have
Tuesday evenings.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.429
I have a...

50:16.680 --> 50:17.829
Commitment.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.592
Set in stone, Nurse Franklin.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.115
Thank you.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.515
I do have an idea where you go
on Tuesday evenings.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.597
- Oh...
- I don't want to pry.

50:31.120 --> 50:34.317
Suffice to say, that I've been
apprised of the rudiments,

50:34.920 --> 50:37.753
and it all seems very sensible to me.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.231
Does she really have to be arrested?

50:44.080 --> 50:45.399
Sergeant?

50:46.520 --> 50:48.511
She'll never have a family.

50:49.720 --> 50:51.233
She almost lost her life.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.199
Surely that's enough.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.828
Can't you...

50:58.840 --> 51:00.068
Look the other way?

51:00.560 --> 51:01.834
It isn't up to me, Sister.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.136
I think it's unlikely that
my superiors will think

51:04.160 --> 51:05.593
it's worth pursuing Miss Whitmore.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.759
It's the abortionists they want.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.997
Oh, that's wonderful news Mr Su.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.776
Have they told you
when she'll be allowed home?

51:15.800 --> 51:19.395
Um, not yet, but they said
I can take Marina in to see her soon.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.070
The only bad thing is, uh, Jeanette
keeps asking for her Nana Meg.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.388
Oh, Meg hasn't seen her?

51:26.000 --> 51:27.956
Nah, she thinks
she'll make her sick again.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.473
I keep telling her she won't,

51:29.560 --> 51:30.959
but it don't make no difference.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.511
Jeanette don't care about
her being a carrier,

51:33.640 --> 51:35.358
she just wants her Nanny Meg back.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.069
We all do.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.558
I don't think
I'll ever have to eat again.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.958
Fred was right about the milk, though.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.880
I don't feel like there's steam
coming out of my ears any more.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.639
Thank you, Tom.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.991
I had the most splendid time.

51:57.960 --> 51:58.960
So did I.

52:01.120 --> 52:02.155
Goodnight.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.068
Good night, Barbara.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.117
Poor Mrs Mahoney.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.556
Such a spirited woman.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.268
I do not like to hear
of her brought low.

52:32.840 --> 52:36.435
What use is she to her family
if her spirit is broken?

52:37.400 --> 52:40.153
We are nothing if we are not of use.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.834
I know.

52:42.400 --> 52:43.674
Pass me that plant, please.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.194
The yellow one.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.869
Hurry, there's much to do.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.868
I don't think these are for planting,
Sister Monica Joan.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.280
I think these may be weeds
that Fred's already pulled up.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.510
I do not believe in weeds.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.233
Look at that glorious colour.

53:01.920 --> 53:06.072
A weed is simply a flower that someone
decides is in the wrong place.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.911
Why should the taraxacums
struggle in the cracks?

53:11.440 --> 53:14.557
It deserves an efficacious spot

53:14.640 --> 53:16.710
in which to flourish.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.631
Just look. That's all I ask.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.671
No, I can't imagine living up here.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.069
Like a bird in a nest.

53:52.840 --> 53:53.989
Look.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.188
Hot water whenever you need it.
Space for a fridge.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.880
You don't even need to take the rubbish
out, you just drop it down a chute.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.595
- Hmm.
- And think how easy it'll be to clean.

54:07.520 --> 54:10.159
No need to scrub those
poor hands till they bleed.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.680
I'm always gonna have it, aren't I?

54:19.520 --> 54:20.520
Meg,

54:22.000 --> 54:23.991
I know what typhoid can cost a family.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.709
I really do.

54:28.840 --> 54:32.833
Your family didn't lose Jeanette.
Please don't let them lose you.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.353
Is this a punishment?

54:39.760 --> 54:41.113
On the contrary, Sister.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.555
I believe it's intended
to be a compliment.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.233
The school governors approached
the Motherhouse directly.

54:47.720 --> 54:48.869
I can't.

54:50.520 --> 54:53.398
I'm not a teacher any more,
I'm a midwife.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.672
- You reminded me of that yourself.
- I did.

54:58.240 --> 55:02.392
But this is an extraordinary situation
and it is only for a few weeks.

55:03.280 --> 55:05.999
A permanent replacement
will be there for the new term.

55:06.560 --> 55:08.915
How can I take the job she loved?

55:10.040 --> 55:11.758
It feels like a betrayal.

55:13.480 --> 55:17.473
Mother Jesu Emmanuel would not ask this,
if she did not think it for the best.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.677
And I must remind you that you
have taken a vow of obedience.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.194
Yes, Sister Julienne.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.828
As have I.

55:32.800 --> 55:37.316
<i>By 1961,
the state had lost its appetite</i>

55:37.400 --> 55:40.631
<i>for prosecuting lonely, desperate women.</i>

55:42.480 --> 55:43.799
<i>So,</i>

55:44.560 --> 55:46.357
<i>when sufficiently recovered,</i>

55:47.400 --> 55:50.870
<i>Dorothy Whitmore was allowed to go.</i>

55:53.080 --> 55:55.310
<i>But if she was not charged,</i>

55:56.200 --> 55:57.679
<i>she was punished.</i>

55:58.240 --> 56:00.390
<i>Dismissed from teaching,</i>

56:00.480 --> 56:02.038
<i>she went elsewhere</i>

56:02.320 --> 56:03.548
<i>to forget,</i>

56:04.040 --> 56:05.519
<i>be forgotten,</i>

56:06.240 --> 56:08.071
<i>and to start afresh,</i>

56:09.360 --> 56:11.999
<i>like legions of others.</i>

56:21.720 --> 56:24.951
<i>Shame is born in public
and lived out secretly.</i>

56:25.240 --> 56:28.232
<i>What is not seen
cannot be scrubbed away.</i>

56:30.640 --> 56:33.518
<i>But so much can be made bearable
by love,</i>

56:34.240 --> 56:36.071
<i>by cherishing what is</i>

56:36.200 --> 56:38.953
<i>and not condemning fault or flaw.</i>

56:39.400 --> 56:41.630
<i>By never locking doors.</i>

56:42.000 --> 56:44.309
<i>By keeping hearts open.</i>

56:44.560 --> 56:47.279
<i>And holding each other forever</i>

56:47.400 --> 56:48.879
<i>in the light.</i>

56:59.040 --> 57:00.917
Hospital routines are rather gruelling.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.395
<i>Are you sure you don't want to send
one of the youngsters?</i>

57:03.480 --> 57:04.959
JULIENNE <i>It's only for a week.</i>

57:05.120 --> 57:07.953
You will do the right thing
by my daughter. Do you hear me?

57:08.120 --> 57:09.235
That's enough, Mr Lanyard.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.470
I'll be asleep when she's born,
you look after her.

57:11.560 --> 57:12.560
I will.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.671
I've come to enquire
about baby Cottingham.

57:14.760 --> 57:15.954
Baby Cottingham?

57:16.880 --> 57:19.030
- Trixie knows about us, Tom.
- Afternoon, Tom.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.798
Afternoon, Barbara.

57:23.500 --> 57:31.500
