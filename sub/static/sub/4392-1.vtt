00:42.794 --> 00:44.796
Good, man. Give me another one.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.930
How long do we have to keep doing this?
My voice is getting hoarse.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.602
Look, somebody's gotta fix this camera.
How else are those scaredy cat kids...

00:57.767 --> 00:59.978
gonna get a picture of themselves
screaming their heads off?

01:00.144 --> 01:02.188
Ha-ha-ha. Scaredy cats.

01:02.355 --> 01:04.232
Funny. What seems to be the trouble?

01:04.399 --> 01:07.318
I don't know. Every photo
has some weird red haze in it.

01:09.779 --> 01:13.032
But I'm pretty sure I just fixed it.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.243
Whew! You smell rotten eggs?

01:22.625 --> 01:24.711
What? Water buffalo?

01:26.045 --> 01:28.006
Water slide? What is it?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.425
- Witch!
- Aah!

01:30.592 --> 01:32.427
Give me rock!

01:47.942 --> 01:51.195
Give me rock!

02:01.831 --> 02:05.209
Give me rock!

02:09.756 --> 02:11.341
Oh, man, I think we lost her.

02:11.883 --> 02:14.177
Give me rock!

02:14.344 --> 02:15.511
Whoa!

02:30.068 --> 02:31.402
Get out of my way.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.737
- There's a...
- We saw a...

02:32.904 --> 02:33.988
- We saw a...
- There's a...

02:34.155 --> 02:35.740
- Witch!
- Witch!

02:35.907 --> 02:38.493
Big deal. A witch, a witch.
Pipe down already.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.245
You're giving me a headache.
Stop getting so excited.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.498
But we saw her.
She had this grotesque head.

02:43.665 --> 02:44.916
It was so frightening.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.794
Well, welcome to KISS World.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.340
That's the whole point of this park,
isn't it? To excite and fright.

02:52.507 --> 02:55.510
Now, get back to work.

02:55.677 --> 03:00.098
Oh, by the way,
don't forget your souvenir photo.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.147
She's back.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.108
Only one thing we can do.

03:10.274 --> 03:14.696
Get me the hottest mystery solvers
in the world.

03:18.783 --> 03:21.619
Like, I can't believe
we get to go to KISS World. Ha-ha.

03:21.786 --> 03:23.454
And solve a mystery.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.707
That's like killing two birds
with one stone.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.292
Yeah. Or two birds with one cat.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.131
Personally, I find their sideshow act
a little juvenile.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.801
But my mother told me to take
a more active role in my friends' interests.

03:36.968 --> 03:39.470
Well, I'm pretty interested
in Starchild.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.639
He's so dreamy.

03:44.142 --> 03:46.310
- Hey.
- Sorry, everyone.

03:46.811 --> 03:48.563
You did that on purpose.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.649
Heh. Now it looks like a shooting star.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.109
Make a wish, Scoob.

03:53.276 --> 03:56.154
Uh, I wish I was eating a Scooby Snack.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.405
Good one, dude.

03:57.572 --> 04:00.658
Uh, I wish I could breathe fire
like the Demon.

04:00.825 --> 04:01.993
Aah!

04:02.160 --> 04:04.078
I wish you'd all come to your senses.

04:04.245 --> 04:08.499
You don't see me acting ridiculous over
my favorite group, the Ascot Five, do you?

04:14.172 --> 04:17.425
Don't tug my ascot
Don't pull my ascot

04:17.591 --> 04:19.260
It's not a scarf

04:19.427 --> 04:21.721
You can't have my ascot
'Cause, girl, it's mine

04:21.887 --> 04:24.182
Ugh. Fred, please.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.351
I'm just saying,
I think they're twice the band KISS is.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.938
But do the Ascot Five have
an awesome amusement park?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.608
Yeah. Awesome amusement park.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.364
It is so majorly groovy to be
at KISS World on Halloween night.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.700
Listen to those crowds.

04:42.867 --> 04:45.870
Oh, I'm so excited.
I think I'm gonna freak out.

04:46.037 --> 04:48.289
Apparently you're not the only one.

04:50.041 --> 04:54.670
Like, dude, don't most people usually run
towards awesome rock concerts?

04:54.837 --> 04:56.547
Not at an Ascot Five concert.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.383
Everyone walks in a calm,
orderly fashion.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.302
- Help!
- Witch!

05:01.803 --> 05:03.721
Oh, my gosh, she's so terrifying.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.723
- The scariest witch ever.
- Witch?

05:05.890 --> 05:07.850
- With the red mist.
- And the creepy laugh.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.602
Save yourself while you can.

05:10.978 --> 05:16.400
Wait a minute. The Demon, the Starchild,
the Catman, the Spaceman. Ho-ho-ho.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.402
Please tell me they added a witch.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.238
Somehow I doubt that.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.657
In fact, it's probably
the reason we're here.

05:22.824 --> 05:25.243
Not me. I'm here for the funnel cake.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.328
Come on, gang, let's get to work.

05:33.084 --> 05:36.170
- Like, excuse me, ma'am.
- Sorry. Park's closed.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.589
- But we're here to solve a mystery.
- Sure you are.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.467
You always wear makeup
when solving crimes?

05:41.634 --> 05:43.553
Heh. I should hope so.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.304
She means the KISS makeup.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.182
No, we're just excited
about the concert tonight.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.518
But we're the mystery solvers
you called for.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.396
I am Delilah Domino, chief of security.

05:53.563 --> 05:55.940
Why would I call mystery solvers?

05:56.107 --> 05:58.401
What? But Daphne took the call.

05:58.568 --> 06:00.111
- Right, Daph?
- Well...

06:00.278 --> 06:01.737
- Daphne?
- Okay.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.699
The thing is, no one actually called
for our help.

06:04.866 --> 06:05.908
What?

06:06.075 --> 06:10.371
But when I heard KISS was throwing a special
Halloween concert, I just had to come.

06:10.538 --> 06:14.542
I mean, look at that poster
of Starchild.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.920
He stares at me wherever I go.

06:18.296 --> 06:22.592
So does the Mona Lisa,
but you don't see us on a plane to Italy.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.595
Why didn't you just tell us the truth?
We all would've come.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.638
- Not me.
- Exactly.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.600
But once we got here,
I knew we'd all have a good time.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.853
Plus I thought the odds were pretty good
there'd be a mystery for us to solve.

06:34.020 --> 06:37.648
I mean, we're the Scooby gang,
and it's an amusement park. Heh.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.150
- Right?
- Wrong.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.152
It's a closed amusement park.

06:41.319 --> 06:44.280
And chances are, there won't be
any Halloween concert either.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.658
- So go home.
- But we've come so far. Heh.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.328
Couldn't we at least have some snacks
for the road?

06:50.494 --> 06:53.205
Maybe some rocky road?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.791
Out.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.758
All right, time to get serious.

07:03.925 --> 07:05.593
It seems KISS needs our help.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.347
Like, I'm no guitarist,
but I can play a mean armpit.

07:11.349 --> 07:14.268
Not to play music, Shaggy,
to solve the mystery.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.771
Well, then it looks like
we'll have to sneak in.

07:16.938 --> 07:18.856
- You're okay with this?
- Of course I am.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.274
It's a mystery, right?

07:20.441 --> 07:23.444
And solving mysteries is what we do.

07:23.611 --> 07:27.073
Caught some kids trying to stay in the park,
Mr. Goldman, but I got rid of them.

07:28.699 --> 07:33.204
- I can't believe we're chasing customers away.
- I know, but we went over this.

07:33.371 --> 07:36.749
Until we solve this witch mystery,
it's safer to keep everyone out.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.793
Now, don't get crazy, Delilah.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.296
Just stay calm because I'm gonna
be very honest with you.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.839
I called for some backup.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.093
Backup? You must be kidding.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.303
Mr. Goldman, I am the chief of security.

07:50.449 --> 07:53.866
I think I can take care
of this unusual situation.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.310
Time is not on our side.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.854
The witch has scared away
too many people.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.858
Tonight's Halloween concert
is our only chance to bring them back.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.655
- Did you hear that?
- We got here just in time.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.407
Come on.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.578
Let's check out the supervisor's office.

08:14.745 --> 08:18.290
Hey, Scoob, bet I can beat you
in a water-gun shootout.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.335
Oh, yeah? You're on.

08:23.838 --> 08:25.881
Chip, you don't understand.

08:26.048 --> 08:30.177
If KISS doesn't perform tonight,
I will lose the park.

08:30.344 --> 08:34.265
That's not my concern, Manny.
All I care about are the concert tours.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.933
Every one of these cities translates
into dollar signs.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.352
You know what happens
if I lose these cities?

08:39.520 --> 08:42.023
You have more time to take your kids
to KISS World.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.107
No, it means I lose money.

08:44.275 --> 08:48.946
Every time KISS comes back into the park,
it means they're not on the road performing...

08:49.113 --> 08:50.865
and I'm not selling their merchandise.

08:51.032 --> 08:56.037
So forgive me, but as far as I'm concerned,
this park can wind up in a toilet.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.122
Preferably this KISS toilet.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.089
Because I don't know
how I'm gonna unload this thing.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.305
Looks like Spaceman
is spaced out. Ha-ha.

09:14.472 --> 09:15.723
Onto Starchild.

09:15.890 --> 09:20.686
Heh. One Catman down
and one Demon to go.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.784
Run for it!

09:36.786 --> 09:40.497
- Run!
- Shaggy, Scooby, wait!

09:42.708 --> 09:45.628
You. I thought I told you kids
to stay out.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.506
- Hey, hey, hey. Whoa! Whoa!
- Sorry.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.673
Calm down.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.718
I'm Manny Goldman, the park supervisor.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.804
What's with all the ruckus?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.222
It's these nosy kids again.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.391
Fortunately, I used to work
for a government defense company...

09:59.558 --> 10:01.727
so I know how to take down intruders.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.229
Like, she's not kidding.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.357
Sorry, everyone.
We're just trying to help.

10:06.524 --> 10:08.526
We overheard
that the park is in trouble.

10:08.692 --> 10:12.655
And seeing how we're such big KISS fans,
we'd like to do all that we can.

10:13.072 --> 10:15.491
We've got it under control, missy.
Thank you very much.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.743
But don't you want the crowds
to come back?

10:17.910 --> 10:19.703
Oh, they'll come back.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.750
To see us.

10:28.963 --> 10:32.049
You show us everything you've got

10:32.216 --> 10:35.177
You keep on dancing
and the room gets hot

10:35.719 --> 10:40.307
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

10:42.518 --> 10:45.479
And you say you wanna go for a spin

10:45.938 --> 10:49.275
The party's just begun, we'll let you in

10:49.441 --> 10:54.822
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

10:56.240 --> 10:59.076
You keep on shouting
You keep on shouting

11:02.746 --> 11:08.002
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

11:08.169 --> 11:09.962
And party every day

11:10.129 --> 11:14.550
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

11:15.050 --> 11:16.802
And party every day

11:16.969 --> 11:20.139
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

11:21.932 --> 11:23.434
And party every day

11:23.809 --> 11:28.522
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

11:28.689 --> 11:30.649
And party every day

11:33.819 --> 11:37.114
You keep saying
you'll be mine for a while

11:37.281 --> 11:40.534
You're looking fancy
and I like your style

11:40.701 --> 11:45.289
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

11:47.499 --> 11:51.003
And you show us everything you've got

11:51.170 --> 11:54.006
Baby, baby, it's quite a lot

11:54.506 --> 11:58.719
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

12:01.222 --> 12:04.808
You keep on shouting
You keep on shouting

12:07.645 --> 12:11.649
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

12:13.192 --> 12:15.069
And party every day

12:15.236 --> 12:19.073
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

12:19.990 --> 12:21.825
And party every day

12:21.992 --> 12:26.664
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

12:26.830 --> 12:28.749
And party every day

12:28.916 --> 12:33.504
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

12:33.671 --> 12:35.547
And party every day

12:49.520 --> 12:52.022
Come on, guys,
these special effects cost money.

12:52.189 --> 12:56.235
I told you, you can't use them
every time you make an entrance.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.366
Like, wow, ha-ha-ha, it's KISS.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.244
- In person.
- And in the flesh.

13:05.411 --> 13:07.830
"In the flesh" is the same
as "in person."

13:07.997 --> 13:10.749
Basically, you have just said
the same thing twice.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.710
How can we help, little lady?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.878
Actually we're here to help you.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.588
We're mystery solvers.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.340
That's funny. So are we.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.926
Wait. You're the ones
they called for help?

13:21.093 --> 13:24.430
Yeah. They wanted the best,
they got the best.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.765
But, like, you're a rock band.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.309
Every band needs a hobby.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.436
The Ascot Five would welcome our help.

13:30.602 --> 13:34.106
Well, I guess we're no
Ascot Five, so scram.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.446
Yeah? Well, amusement-park mysteries
happen to be our specialty.

13:40.612 --> 13:45.075
We solved the "Foul Play in Funland" case,
stopped the Roller Ghoster in his tracks...

13:45.242 --> 13:49.288
and captured the monster
of Our Lady of Mercy's parking lot.

13:49.455 --> 13:51.582
I guess that was more of a street fair.

13:51.749 --> 13:54.752
That's cute, but we solve mysteries
on a cosmic level.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.337
What does that mean?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.757
It means we don't need your help.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.217
Now, hold on, guys.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.927
Let's not be hasty.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.095
- What?
- Really?

14:05.262 --> 14:06.680
Not again.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.016
You know how the eye sees everything.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.435
Well, I just caught
a glimpse of the future.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.688
Yeah, and I bet the future is a redhead.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.441
Ha-ha. You bet. I mean, in a way.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.026
Don't ask me how or why...

14:19.193 --> 14:22.696
but I think we're going to need
these kids to catch that witch.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.948
You're kidding. They're just humans.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.368
Not even all of them.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.871
I know, but the eye never lies.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.165
- I guess they're okay.
- If you think so, Starchild.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.376
I do not like this.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.296
On second thought,
we've decided you can help.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.048
That's great.

14:41.215 --> 14:46.095
I guess the first question is:
Who is this witch everyone's talking about?

14:49.014 --> 14:51.350
Give me rock!

14:54.478 --> 14:57.564
Obviously you've done this before.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.652
Get out of my locker!

15:01.819 --> 15:04.905
But it's so cozy.

15:06.824 --> 15:10.244
Give me rock!

15:10.661 --> 15:12.329
It's like she's searching for something.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.082
And I'm going to guess
that something is a rock.

15:17.835 --> 15:19.920
Do you think you could show us
around the park?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.673
I'd like to see some of the places
where the witch has been.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.758
No problem. Right, fellas?

15:24.925 --> 15:28.011
Count me out.
The Demon needs to feed the beast.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.514
Did he say, uh, "beast"?

15:30.681 --> 15:32.099
He means his stomach.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.602
Then my beast is growling too.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.354
How about yours, bud?

15:42.276 --> 15:44.445
Heh. My beast is starving.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.863
Like, catch you later.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.615
It's beast-feeding time.

15:49.158 --> 15:52.035
I'm ready for that tour now. Heh-heh.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.746
If by "tour," you mean
"begin the investigation."

15:54.913 --> 15:57.291
Let's hit it, fellow mystery solvers.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.877
I guess I'll see you out there.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.882
Guys, these special effects cost money.

16:05.048 --> 16:09.261
Just think, Scooby-Doo,
a million fast-food stands just for us.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.555
It's like carbohydrate heaven.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.432
Oh! The Demon.

16:18.395 --> 16:21.899
Mmm. Nice and toasty.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.236
Like, wow, I wonder how he does that.

16:26.403 --> 16:30.115
Man, if we could breathe fire,
we could pop our own popcorn.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.492
Yeah.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.247
Come on, we gotta get past him.

16:42.461 --> 16:43.921
Hm?

16:49.593 --> 16:52.095
Dude, you sure you know
where you're going?

16:52.262 --> 16:54.723
Yeah. Cheeseburgers straight ahead.

16:54.890 --> 16:55.933
Oh!

17:00.938 --> 17:02.731
Yoinks!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.278
Like, sorry, Mr. Demon.
Scooby didn't mean it.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.614
He was afraid of your dragon boot.

17:10.948 --> 17:16.078
I don't suppose you could wear
an open-toed demon sandal?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.011
That was close.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.306
Could've been worse.
We could've been on the menu. Heh-heh.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.641
Come on, Scooby-Doo.

17:37.808 --> 17:41.562
If we can't eat, at least we can go
on some rides, ha-ha-ha, right?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.313
Right.

17:47.859 --> 17:51.029
I have to say,
this is some amusement park.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.783
Thanks. We each took a section
and designed it ourselves.

17:54.950 --> 18:00.247
There's my Brimstone Barbeque,
the hottest ride in the park.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.754
Like, that was well done.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.382
Yeah, and so are we.

18:10.549 --> 18:13.635
And my Electric Alley.

18:14.344 --> 18:18.348
This ride gets my volt.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.310
It's shocking.

18:21.476 --> 18:25.814
Don't forget my Whirling Wildcats.

18:27.899 --> 18:31.820
And my Dynasty Star Ferris Wheel. Whoo!

18:32.613 --> 18:37.200
A great place to view
with KISS binoculars, only $24.99.

18:39.703 --> 18:43.749
- What's that ride?
- That's our most wicked ride of all...

18:43.915 --> 18:45.834
the Destroyer.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.502
But it's closed to the public.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.464
The Crimson Witch scared a couple
of repairmen on it ealier tonight.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.758
It looks pretty terrifying.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.178
Not if you were with me, darling.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.930
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, Fred.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.351
I'm sorry, Velma,
but I can't compete with Starchild.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.852
You don't need to.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.689
Remember, underneath all that makeup
is just a regular guy...

19:07.856 --> 19:10.067
who puts his pants on
like everyone else.

19:10.609 --> 19:13.654
KISS costume change, activate.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.447
Oh, come on.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.949
Relax, Fred.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.909
I think this was all pre-planned.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.578
You're right. It was a dress rehearsal
for tonight's show.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.915
- Good test run, fellas.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.584
We need to be doing
our own investigation.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.753
All right, Demon, I hear you.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.257
Hey, guys, we're gonna take a break.

20:17.134 --> 20:19.761
Hi, I'm Shandi Strutter.
KISS'S head techie.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.348
- Hi, I'm Velma, and this is Fred and Daphne.
- Nice to meet you.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.017
So you're responsible for all
the band's stage effects, huh?

20:26.184 --> 20:28.770
Most of them, yeah.
The guys like to put on a show.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.022
You don't have to tell me.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.442
- Heh-heh.
- Daphne's a fan.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.153
Um, KISS doesn't have fans, Freddie.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.196
They're called the KISS Army.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.532
I prefer the Ascot Five, myself.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.660
- Do they have an army?
- It's more of an all-volunteer...

20:43.827 --> 20:46.788
international organization
of enthusiastic youths.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.833
- Cool.
- As in lame.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.343
Good deal finding
that ice cream stand, Scoob.

21:00.510 --> 21:05.474
We'll have this case licked in no time.
Ha-ha-ha.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.477
Yeah. Licked.

21:10.937 --> 21:11.938
Ah.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.359
Dude, maybe we should investigate
the Rockin' Flume.

21:17.861 --> 21:22.532
"Your tongue must be this long
to ride this ride."

21:24.367 --> 21:26.203
Hey.

21:28.371 --> 21:33.043
Looks like your tongue's long enough
to get us both on this ride. Heh-heh.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.214
It's like the perfect park day.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.759
No lines, no operators.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.059
Huh?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.479
Aah! Pyew.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.731
Like, what died in here?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.569
Give me rock!

25:02.335 --> 25:05.880
Scoob, look, it's KISS!

25:39.205 --> 25:41.916
Whoa! KISS is super buff.

26:05.857 --> 26:09.235
You'll never stop me.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.581
We heard the commotion.
Are you guys okay?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.917
Hey, man, heh-heh...

26:24.084 --> 26:27.921
did anyone catch the license
plate number on that witch?

26:33.843 --> 26:35.553
Poor Scooby and Shaggy.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.846
They're still out.

26:37.013 --> 26:40.809
Pardon me, Chip McGhoo, KISS road manager,
executive officer of merchandise.

26:41.101 --> 26:45.313
These KISS smelling salts work twice
as fast and they're only $15.95.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.776
Ugh.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.869
They're still not coming around.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.747
- Sorry. No refunds.
- I think I might have the solution.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.667
Try this churro I grabbed
from the concession stand.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.215
Aah!

27:16.469 --> 27:18.429
- Hey, man.
- Hi, Shaggy.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.764
How do you feel?

27:19.931 --> 27:21.850
I feel like a couple more churros.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.351
How about you, Scooby-Doo?

27:23.518 --> 27:25.562
Yeah. And doughnuts too.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.105
How about some KISS Kakes?

27:27.272 --> 27:30.066
Now with Spaceman sprinkles.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.069
- What happened?
- Well, first we got some ice cream...

27:33.236 --> 27:35.405
which Scooby-Doo licked away from me.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.741
Mmm. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.162
Then there was this smell
and the stinky witch...

27:42.328 --> 27:45.957
and all this running and music
and spinning and then...

27:46.124 --> 27:48.042
Uh, and then...

27:48.209 --> 27:49.669
Like, they saved us.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.754
KISS and their super powers.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.674
That's right, KISS has super powers.

27:54.841 --> 27:58.303
Sounds like they spun around
one two many times in those drums.

27:58.469 --> 28:02.056
No. Like, he shot eye beams,
he grew claws...

28:02.223 --> 28:08.271
he did lightning bolts, and he flew in
and blew the biggest fire ever.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.607
Thank you, Mr. Demon.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.109
Beat it, mutt, before you dent my armor.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.278
Uh, yes, sir. Of course, sir.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.449
- Shaggy, you're imagining things.
- He didn't imagine the witch, that's for sure.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.492
What should we do now?

28:21.659 --> 28:22.869
You must leave!

28:23.036 --> 28:27.040
Trust me, KISS,
these children are nothing but trouble.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.751
You think they're allies,
but in the end...

28:29.918 --> 28:33.713
the only person they'll help
is the Crimson Witch...

28:33.880 --> 28:37.842
in her plans to bring total devastation
to this world.

28:38.009 --> 28:41.471
They must go now or all is lost.

28:43.223 --> 28:44.807
Huh?

28:46.643 --> 28:49.062
Guys, you've gotta stop doing this.

28:49.229 --> 28:52.482
If you wanna speak further,
you know where to find me.

28:55.944 --> 28:58.446
- Who was that?
- Chikara, the psychic.

28:58.613 --> 29:01.199
- She works at the park.
- She tells people's fortunes.

29:01.366 --> 29:04.202
Well, she smells like a mixture
of patchouli and hobo.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.828
She's actually very wise.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.498
- Maybe someone should talk to her.
- I'll go.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.124
Mind if I tag along?

29:10.291 --> 29:14.337
I find it odd that she thinks
she knows so much about the witch.

29:15.713 --> 29:19.217
Some of us should go back to the drum ride
and try to pick up the witch's trail.

29:19.384 --> 29:22.720
I'll go with you, if you want.

29:23.471 --> 29:24.806
I want.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.019
I'll go too.

29:30.186 --> 29:33.564
Demon, Catman,
keep an eye on Scooby and Shaggy.

29:33.731 --> 29:37.610
I got better things to do
than babysit dogs and hippies.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.070
Hey, have fun.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.785
These confetti bombs
just aren't getting any cheaper.

29:50.873 --> 29:53.751
There. I got some residue
from the witch's mist.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.004
Oh, heh, that's nice, Fred.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.090
Say, could you take a picture of me
and Starchild looking for clues?

30:01.592 --> 30:03.678
Is this really necessary?

30:03.845 --> 30:07.223
He's a rock star, Fred. A rock star.

30:07.390 --> 30:10.184
- Just do it.
- All right.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.440
And a couple more for safety.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.487
Thank you so much.

30:21.654 --> 30:25.325
- My pleasure.
- Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

30:26.367 --> 30:30.288
Ugh! Fred. Your thumb was in the way.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.373
On all of them.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.083
Oh, gosh. Heh.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.293
I'm sorry.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.712
Are you doing this on purpose?

30:37.879 --> 30:40.089
No. I just don't see
what the big deal is.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.300
We've solved over
a thousand mysteries together...

30:42.467 --> 30:45.261
and you've never once asked
to have a picture taken with me.

30:45.428 --> 30:47.889
No worries.
I got one of the both of you.

30:48.056 --> 30:50.641
In vibrant, colorful acrylic.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.812
- You just painted our portrait?
- Sure.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.981
- Just now?
- No big deal.

30:57.148 --> 30:59.400
Just something I do in my spare time.

30:59.567 --> 31:03.404
Oops. Well, look,
my thumb got in the way.

31:03.571 --> 31:04.906
But you painted it.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.909
Luckily I did a couple more for safety.

31:08.618 --> 31:11.287
Aah! It's beautiful.

31:13.164 --> 31:15.750
I think I liked your thumb better.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.419
We should take some more pictures
of the scene itself.

31:18.586 --> 31:23.841
No need. One scan with my special eye
will tell us all we'll need to know.

31:24.008 --> 31:28.179
It puts the X in x-ray.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.019
Oof. My nephew had a special eye.

31:35.186 --> 31:38.606
A pink one we called conjunctivitis.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.820
There's definitely a supernatural
presence at work here.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.155
Hey, guys, wait. Listen.

31:49.826 --> 31:52.870
Not bad, but I am not into tap dancing.

31:53.037 --> 31:56.666
I am purely into rock 'n' roll!

31:56.833 --> 31:58.042
Whoa, yeah!

31:59.335 --> 32:01.087
Okay.

32:01.254 --> 32:04.298
Well, one side sounds solid.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.968
And the other hollow.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.886
As if it's some sort of trapdoor.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.055
Exactly.

32:13.850 --> 32:16.853
It looks like one of the doors
to the catacombs.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.062
The what-a-combs?

32:18.229 --> 32:22.150
The catacombs are what we call
the maze of hallways that run under the park.

32:22.316 --> 32:26.487
They give us access to any area,
including the main stage.

32:26.654 --> 32:29.157
I'll bet this is how
the witch disappeared.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.366
Sounds dangerous.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.326
- Stay back, Frank.
- It's Fred.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.579
I'll go first to make sure it's safe.

32:37.248 --> 32:40.001
Oh! I hope he's all right.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.212
Oh, for Pete's sake.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.673
What are you doing?

32:45.840 --> 32:49.635
It's not like this is the first time
I've ever climbed into a... Aah!

32:49.802 --> 32:50.803
Oof!

32:53.389 --> 32:55.391
I'd watch that last step.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.560
It's a doozy.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.194
Chikara, we need to talk.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.863
Ah. Spaceman, I sensed your approach.

33:09.030 --> 33:13.117
- You mean you heard the wind chimes?
- Hmph. Why do you bring this one with you?

33:13.284 --> 33:15.369
Starchild seems to think they're okay.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.039
Plus, they've got a talking dog,
which is kind of wild.

33:18.206 --> 33:20.708
Starchild cannot see as deep as I can.

33:20.875 --> 33:25.379
He has but one special eye,
whereas I have two.

33:25.546 --> 33:27.465
Some people say I have four.

33:27.632 --> 33:30.676
I know you think this is a joke,
Miss Smarty-Pants...

33:30.843 --> 33:33.638
but your ignorance will cost us all.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.515
Okay, then, I'm game.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.099
Tell us what we need to know.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.476
How serious is the threat?

33:38.643 --> 33:41.103
The danger grows, Spaceman.

33:41.270 --> 33:45.983
The Crimson Witch senses
the rock of Kissteria is near.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.694
Rock of Kissteria? What's that?

33:48.861 --> 33:51.447
It's the key to holding evil at bay.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.992
This began on a Halloween night
on another world...

33:55.159 --> 33:59.205
in a cosmic realm known as Kissteria.

34:07.838 --> 34:11.967
An evil Sorceress,
called the Crimson Witch...

34:12.134 --> 34:17.806
created a gigantic horror
known as the Destroyer.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.813
She sent the Destroyer to spread
devastation throughout the land...

34:23.980 --> 34:28.775
the first step toward infecting
the entire realm with evil.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.487
Destroy!

34:36.117 --> 34:38.286
But the warriors had a weapon.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.496
Cosmic power crystals.

34:40.663 --> 34:42.873
The Kissteria crystals.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.460
Each crystal sounded a musical note.

34:49.672 --> 34:56.012
The warriors used the music of the crystals
to force the Destroyer to retreat...

34:56.178 --> 35:00.308
and once the monster was back inside
its volcanic temple...

35:00.474 --> 35:03.644
No!

35:06.647 --> 35:10.026
They transferred the musical energy
of the crystals...

35:10.192 --> 35:13.696
into a single, powerful...

35:14.780 --> 35:16.532
rock.

35:17.867 --> 35:23.956
That rock, the rock of Kissteria,
became the key.

35:24.123 --> 35:29.629
By removing it,
the Destroyer would be trapped forever.

35:30.421 --> 35:35.009
Naturally, the Crimson Witch
has been desperate to retrieve it...

35:35.176 --> 35:37.261
especially by Halloween night...

35:37.428 --> 35:41.307
when circumstances are ripe
to release the Destroyer.

35:41.474 --> 35:42.767
Where's the rock now?

35:42.933 --> 35:46.270
It's had many protectors over the ages.

35:46.437 --> 35:51.484
Each one a descendant of the musical
warriors who fought so bravely.

35:51.651 --> 35:56.864
Today these guardians are known as KISS.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.240
You guys have it?

35:58.407 --> 36:01.243
Yep. We used to display it
at the Hall of KISStory in the park.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.246
But when it gets near Halloween,
we keep it with us on tour.

36:04.413 --> 36:05.498
Wait a second.

36:05.665 --> 36:06.791
Is this the rock?

36:06.957 --> 36:11.128
The Detroit Rock that you received
as a gift from the city of Detroit?

36:11.295 --> 36:13.381
That's just a cover story.

36:13.547 --> 36:17.301
Yeah. And isn't the Destroyer
just the name of a ride?

36:17.468 --> 36:18.803
Blasphemous!

36:18.969 --> 36:20.846
Have you learned nothing?

36:21.013 --> 36:25.309
The Destroyer will strike fear
into your heart.

36:25.476 --> 36:28.437
I know. That's what the poster says.

36:30.106 --> 36:32.400
Aah! Get her away from me.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.736
She and her friends will do
more harm than good.

36:38.322 --> 36:39.573
That woman is crazy.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.784
But her powers are impressive.

36:41.951 --> 36:43.661
You actually believe all that?

36:43.828 --> 36:45.413
Chikara's never wrong.

36:45.579 --> 36:49.375
Except that time she predicted
the Love Gun album would go gold.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.252
Because it went platinum!

36:51.419 --> 36:53.462
Oh, yeah, baby.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.718
Starchild!

36:58.884 --> 37:00.678
Starchild!

37:00.845 --> 37:03.597
Oh. I hope nothing's happened to him.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.017
What was that?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.687
Of all the times to be
without my flashlight.

37:09.854 --> 37:12.148
- Aah!
- You wanna buy a KISS flashlight?

37:12.314 --> 37:13.649
Comes with a handy key ring.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.403
What are you doing down here?

37:17.570 --> 37:22.407
Hey, I was just checking on the props
of the concert, and I got lost in this maze.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.203
There it is again.

37:27.329 --> 37:30.332
Oh, if I only stocked up
on KISS batteries.

37:30.499 --> 37:33.544
Hang on. I can use my cell phone.

37:37.506 --> 37:40.593
Oh. Those are the props
I've been looking for.

37:41.677 --> 37:44.180
KISS monster props,
part of the Halloween show.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.891
House seats still available.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.438
- That doesn't sound like a prop.
- This way.

37:52.605 --> 37:53.814
You're leaving?

37:53.981 --> 37:56.525
Hello? Manager in the dark.

37:56.692 --> 37:57.693
Hello?

38:00.362 --> 38:01.572
In here.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.036
I got it. Ungh! Ah!

38:07.203 --> 38:08.537
Freddie!

38:08.704 --> 38:10.164
What is this place?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.210
It's my special effects lab.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.837
I thought I told you guys to stay back.

38:17.004 --> 38:20.132
Some of us had other ideas.

38:21.884 --> 38:24.053
Don't worry, Fred. We can dry you off.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.722
Beth? Christine?

38:30.142 --> 38:33.395
Okay. All right. That's good. Thank you.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.236
I take it you didn't find the witch.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.947
I searched this whole sector
except for the chem lab.

38:43.113 --> 38:46.158
- That's why I came to Shandi.
- I'm the only one who has the key.

38:50.371 --> 38:54.625
For the last few months, chemicals have gone
missing, so I keep the lab under lock and key.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.670
No one gets in without
coming to me first.

39:01.090 --> 39:02.883
See? Empty.

39:03.425 --> 39:06.428
Hey, is that a chemical analyzer?

39:06.595 --> 39:07.972
Pretty smart of you, Fred.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.599
Oh, I've got a couple at home.

39:10.766 --> 39:14.603
Hey, do you think you can analyze this?
It's the residue from the witch's mist.

39:14.770 --> 39:18.023
Sure. Anything for a fellow chemmy.

39:25.739 --> 39:30.119
I don't think I've worked this hard
in, like, ho-ho, forever.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.787
Me neither.

39:31.954 --> 39:35.249
Hey, Mr. Catman, when do we get to eat?

39:35.416 --> 39:37.918
After you've brought
the KISS monsters on-stage.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.921
Monsters?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.841
Yeah, Chip brought them over.
They're below us.

39:44.008 --> 39:46.510
- Like, where are the stairs, man?
- Don't need them.

39:57.688 --> 39:59.440
That must be them, Scoob.

39:59.607 --> 40:02.818
Now, these are the kind
of monsters I like.

40:02.985 --> 40:05.404
- Fake ones.
- Ah!

40:05.571 --> 40:06.614
Shaggy, look.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.700
It's KISS'S green room
where they hang out before the show.

40:10.034 --> 40:11.952
Scoob, you hit the jackpot.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.789
Think of all impressive people
who have been invited down here.

40:16.373 --> 40:20.252
The pizza-delivery guy,
the sandwich-delivery guy...

40:20.419 --> 40:25.382
the creepy witch,
the sushi-delivery guy...

40:26.216 --> 40:28.302
Give me rock!

40:28.761 --> 40:31.472
Zoinks! Creepy witch.

40:39.772 --> 40:43.150
Like, maybe she'll think
this is the real KISS and go away.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.070
Alive!

41:10.052 --> 41:13.514
Please go away. Please go away.
Please go away.

41:14.390 --> 41:15.557
Huh?

41:15.724 --> 41:17.393
Are they gone?

41:19.269 --> 41:22.022
Maybe they're waiting for us
to let our guard down.

41:22.189 --> 41:25.734
Well, they're gonna have
to wait a long time.

41:25.901 --> 41:27.736
Shaggy? Scooby?

41:27.903 --> 41:28.946
Are you in there?

41:29.113 --> 41:31.156
Like, how do they know our names?

41:31.323 --> 41:34.243
- Shaggy.
- Velma?

41:34.410 --> 41:37.121
Why are you not being eaten
by KISS monsters?

41:37.287 --> 41:39.832
- KISS monsters?
- What are you talking about?

41:40.624 --> 41:42.501
They're gone.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.923
I can't say we don't have
enough suspects.

41:48.090 --> 41:49.717
The problem is finding a motive.

41:49.883 --> 41:52.761
The only one who'd like the park
to shut down is Chip.

41:52.928 --> 41:56.098
- But he doesn't seem smart enough.
- Shandi's smart enough.

41:56.265 --> 41:59.018
I know, but she's way
too cute to be a suspect.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.396
Mr. Goldman and the security lady
don't want the park to close.

42:02.563 --> 42:03.856
They'll lose their jobs.

42:04.023 --> 42:06.734
Chikara is the one
who's the most obsessed with the witch.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.236
She talks as if she is
really supernatural.

42:09.403 --> 42:11.822
- She's not?
- No, Shaggy, she's not.

42:11.989 --> 42:15.576
No matter what you think you've seen,
there has to be a rational explanation.

42:15.743 --> 42:17.453
It all centers on that rock.

42:17.619 --> 42:22.416
The so-called rock of Kissteria,
which seems to be KISS'S Detroit Rock.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.627
You mean the one they sing about
in that song "Detroit Rock City"?

42:25.794 --> 42:27.838
I always thought that stood
for rock 'n' roll.

42:28.005 --> 42:30.632
Huh. I never thought of that.

42:30.799 --> 42:31.884
I guess that works too.

42:32.051 --> 42:33.469
Did you figure anything out?

42:33.635 --> 42:37.306
Not yet. But if we had that rock,
we might be able to set a trap.

42:37.473 --> 42:41.185
Then maybe it's time
we hand it over to you, darling.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.482
I do not like this.

42:46.648 --> 42:47.649
It's going to be fine.

42:47.816 --> 42:50.027
How do you know?

42:50.778 --> 42:51.779
Oy.

42:51.945 --> 42:54.990
Come on, Demon, if we don't stop
the witch tonight, the park will go under.

42:55.157 --> 42:57.367
So let's rock these kids already.

43:01.705 --> 43:03.957
Ugh. All right.

43:12.716 --> 43:15.511
Jinkies, it's a black diamond.

43:15.677 --> 43:17.805
The largest in the world.

43:17.971 --> 43:22.059
That explains why the Crimson Witch has
turned this place upside down looking for it.

43:22.226 --> 43:24.228
Now it's just a matter
of setting a trap.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.481
Yeah, so, like, who's gonna be the bait?

43:27.856 --> 43:28.982
You are.

43:29.399 --> 43:33.112
Scoob, how is it that out of four
ginormous superheroes...

43:33.278 --> 43:35.197
you and I have to do the hard part?

43:35.364 --> 43:37.574
Oh, just lucky I guess.

43:37.741 --> 43:39.326
Come on, you can do it.

43:39.493 --> 43:42.746
Yeah, we can't lure her out.
Put yourself in our shoes.

43:42.913 --> 43:46.208
You know what? That might just help.

43:53.549 --> 43:57.427
Dude, I figure the bigger the shoes,
the faster we'll run.

43:57.594 --> 44:00.389
Heh-heh. Good idea, Shaggy.

44:00.556 --> 44:03.725
Just make sure the witch sees the rock.

44:06.186 --> 44:08.981
Fred? Daphne? You in position?

44:10.065 --> 44:12.985
Roger that.
Just make sure you bring her our way.

44:13.152 --> 44:15.529
Okay, then, you two, start walking.

44:15.696 --> 44:17.823
Not a problem.

44:18.323 --> 44:21.618
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Ho-ho.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.745
Problem.

44:24.288 --> 44:29.418
Come on, guys, we have to get this mystery
wrapped up before the concert starts.

44:30.794 --> 44:33.463
How does KISS walk in these things?

44:33.630 --> 44:36.800
We want KISS! We want KISS!

44:36.967 --> 44:38.635
I thought the concert was off.

44:38.802 --> 44:39.970
It's on again.

44:40.137 --> 44:42.723
KISS thinks they can nab the witch
before it starts.

44:42.890 --> 44:44.433
Nice that someone tells me.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.644
I only happen to be in charge
of backstage security.

44:48.937 --> 44:51.190
Better be ready for anything, Delilah.

44:51.356 --> 44:54.276
Those fans are gonna get
the best Halloween concert...

44:54.443 --> 44:57.196
that 150 bucks can buy.

44:58.947 --> 45:02.075
Didn't KISS tell you?
They're performing for free.

45:02.242 --> 45:04.995
Free? Oh, my heart!

45:05.162 --> 45:06.288
And how about this?

45:06.455 --> 45:08.749
They're even giving away T-shirts.

45:09.082 --> 45:11.501
Where is my KISS defibrillator?

45:12.711 --> 45:15.088
Rock of Kissteria!

45:15.255 --> 45:18.008
Get your rock of Kissteria here!

45:18.175 --> 45:21.386
Rare object of cosmic origin!

45:23.222 --> 45:25.807
Dude, you been eating beef jerky again?

45:25.974 --> 45:27.684
No, not this time.

45:27.851 --> 45:29.937
Then she's here. Aah!

45:36.151 --> 45:37.986
You gotta get her closer to us.

45:39.488 --> 45:42.699
Man, these boots were a terrible idea.

45:42.866 --> 45:46.119
Give me rock!

45:49.706 --> 45:52.417
- It's mine.
- Now.

45:58.966 --> 46:03.679
Okay, let's see who
this fake witch really is.

46:08.934 --> 46:11.270
I don't remember her
on the suspect list.

46:13.230 --> 46:15.440
Agh! Fools.

46:15.607 --> 46:19.111
The Destroyer will feast on your fear.

46:45.595 --> 46:46.763
There she is.

46:58.025 --> 47:00.277
Ding-dong, the witch is down.

47:02.362 --> 47:03.405
Scratch that.

47:07.784 --> 47:09.286
Here, Shaggy.

47:30.557 --> 47:31.600
Thanks.

47:51.036 --> 47:53.288
Like, somebody help us!

47:55.207 --> 47:56.541
Whoa!

48:01.421 --> 48:03.548
- Jeepers.
- What just happened?

48:03.715 --> 48:06.134
The Crimson Witch ripped a hole
in the universe.

48:06.301 --> 48:08.720
Activate the Dynasty Star Portal.

48:08.887 --> 48:10.138
You mean the Ferris wheel?

48:10.305 --> 48:13.141
It's actually a portal
to the cosmic realm of Kissteria.

48:13.308 --> 48:14.476
Of course it is.

48:14.643 --> 48:16.353
Does she have to come?

48:16.520 --> 48:18.188
Does your eye see the future?

48:18.355 --> 48:21.608
Then let's rip this open.

48:41.461 --> 48:42.546
Ooh, yeah

49:04.776 --> 49:06.611
Tonight

49:07.529 --> 49:10.031
I wanna give it all to you

49:12.075 --> 49:14.244
In the darkness

49:15.996 --> 49:17.497
There's so much I wanna do

49:19.541 --> 49:20.917
And tonight

49:22.711 --> 49:25.714
I wanna lay it at your feet

49:26.923 --> 49:30.427
'Cause, girl, I was made for you

49:30.594 --> 49:33.930
And, girl, you were made for me

49:35.432 --> 49:39.102
I was made for loving you, baby

49:39.269 --> 49:42.522
You were made for loving me

49:42.689 --> 49:46.735
And I can't get enough of you, baby

49:46.902 --> 49:50.280
Can you get enough of me?

49:50.447 --> 49:51.948
Tonight

49:53.283 --> 49:56.328
I wanna see it in your eyes

49:57.579 --> 49:59.706
Feel the magic

50:01.625 --> 50:04.628
Something that drives me wild

50:05.170 --> 50:06.880
And tonight

50:08.632 --> 50:11.426
We're gonna make it all come true

50:12.385 --> 50:15.180
'Cause, girl, you were made for me

50:16.139 --> 50:18.975
And, girl, I was made for you

50:21.311 --> 50:24.814
I was made for loving you, baby

50:24.981 --> 50:28.818
You were made for loving me

50:28.985 --> 50:32.239
And I can't get enough of you, baby

50:32.405 --> 50:36.243
Can you get enough of me?

50:36.409 --> 50:40.080
I was made for loving you, baby

50:40.247 --> 50:43.041
You were made for loving me

50:43.792 --> 50:47.629
And I can give it all to you, baby

50:47.796 --> 50:51.633
Can you give it all to me?

50:55.178 --> 50:57.764
Oh, whoa, oh

51:11.945 --> 51:15.782
I have rock!

51:37.637 --> 51:40.098
Whoa. Where are we?

51:40.265 --> 51:44.519
It's like KISS World but weirder,
if that's possible.

51:44.686 --> 51:47.147
Seems like more special effects to me.

51:47.480 --> 51:50.025
I don't know. It looks pretty real.

51:50.191 --> 51:51.401
I'm afraid.

51:51.568 --> 51:54.029
Come on, Daphne,
we're still in the theme park.

51:54.195 --> 51:56.323
We've seen stranger things.

51:56.489 --> 52:00.660
Come, Scooby gang,
we must seek the Elder.

52:01.202 --> 52:05.373
No, these guys take the cake
of strangeness.

52:10.378 --> 52:12.380
Happy feet again, Scoob.

52:12.547 --> 52:16.426
Ew. It doesn't smell happy to me.

52:22.432 --> 52:24.643
Where is everyone?

52:31.941 --> 52:33.318
That must be her.

52:33.485 --> 52:34.694
The Elder.

52:34.861 --> 52:37.364
She's certainly not the Younger.

52:43.411 --> 52:50.335
A shadow has fallen across Kissteria and
your arrival here only confirms the worst.

52:50.502 --> 52:53.588
The Crimson Witch has the rock.

52:53.755 --> 52:56.424
I'm afraid so.
We lost her in the portal.

52:56.591 --> 52:58.677
Then we have little time to act.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.011
Who are they?

53:01.513 --> 53:02.722
Earth kids.

53:02.889 --> 53:04.265
Are they worthy?

53:04.683 --> 53:08.144
- Eh.
- Their hearts are pure, their spirits strong.

53:08.311 --> 53:12.107
- And their stomachs empty.
- Yeah, empty.

53:12.273 --> 53:14.401
Zip it.

53:14.567 --> 53:16.736
You children should prepare yourself.

53:16.903 --> 53:20.615
If the Crimson Witch succeeds
in releasing the Destroyer...

53:20.782 --> 53:24.828
he will engulf your world
in a torrent of darkness and evil.

53:24.994 --> 53:27.372
I'm ready, Your Majesty.

53:27.539 --> 53:29.791
Fred, is that makeup?

53:29.958 --> 53:31.793
It's a moon.

53:33.461 --> 53:36.047
- Whoa! Who hit you, buddy?
- No one.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.425
- Looks like a black eye.
- It's not.

53:38.591 --> 53:39.843
Nice shiner.

53:40.009 --> 53:41.302
It's a moon.

53:41.469 --> 53:44.931
Please, you seem like a nice boy.
Go stand with your friends.

53:45.765 --> 53:48.810
Fred, are you trying to impress me?

53:48.977 --> 53:52.814
No. It's just that, well,
you've been hanging all over Starface.

53:52.981 --> 53:54.649
- Have not.
- Have so.

53:54.816 --> 53:56.067
- Have not.
- Have so.

53:56.234 --> 53:59.154
- Have not.
- Guys, guys.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.697
You've gotta stop this.

54:00.864 --> 54:03.408
If we're ever going to finish
this cosmic boondoggle...

54:03.575 --> 54:07.662
and get back to solving the real mystery,
we need to act like a team.

54:07.829 --> 54:08.955
All of us.

54:09.497 --> 54:11.166
Even these weirdos.

54:11.332 --> 54:14.169
The sarcastic girl speaks the truth.

54:14.502 --> 54:20.175
Only together will you have the power
and skills needed to defeat the Destroyer.

54:23.845 --> 54:27.515
Starchild, do you mind if I ask
where you get your super powers from?

54:27.682 --> 54:28.850
Rock 'n' roll.

54:29.017 --> 54:31.478
It powers everything in Kissteria.

54:31.644 --> 54:34.689
I don't know. Maybe I can find
friends with normal interests.

54:34.856 --> 54:37.066
Be careful with that bass.

54:37.358 --> 54:39.652
Because it's made from alien technology?

54:39.819 --> 54:42.655
Because it costs more than your house.

54:44.407 --> 54:47.869
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Demon,
is it rock 'n' roll...

54:48.036 --> 54:50.163
- that makes you breathe fire?
- No.

54:50.330 --> 54:52.248
- Then what does? Tamales?
- No.

54:52.415 --> 54:53.708
- Hot peppers?
- No.

54:53.875 --> 54:56.336
- Chimichanga sauce?
- No.

54:58.797 --> 55:03.301
You might as well tell them, Demon,
before we get another grocery list.

55:07.555 --> 55:12.101
The secret to breathing fire
is to swallow your fears.

55:12.393 --> 55:15.522
- Fears?
- Like, I didn't know you could eat those.

55:15.688 --> 55:18.483
Swallow them up, hold them inside...

55:18.650 --> 55:23.404
and force them out as demon fire.

55:26.032 --> 55:28.076
Talk about your acid reflux.

55:28.409 --> 55:32.163
There it is, the tomb of the Destroyer.

55:32.747 --> 55:35.375
And there's the witch.

55:58.314 --> 56:01.067
You shouldn't have
brought them here, KISS.

56:01.484 --> 56:04.070
They will surely never
leave Kissteria...

56:04.237 --> 56:05.738
alive!

56:24.382 --> 56:26.968
I'll go after her myself.

56:27.135 --> 56:29.888
You guys stay and protect the kids.

56:30.263 --> 56:33.600
Oh, great, more babysitting.

56:47.488 --> 56:50.491
This is one heck
of a theme-park attraction.

57:31.407 --> 57:32.450
Oh, no.

57:32.617 --> 57:34.327
Dead end.

57:38.581 --> 57:41.626
Like, have you been swallowing
your fears, Scooby-Doo?

57:41.793 --> 57:44.212
Oh, yeah. Lots of them.

57:45.588 --> 57:48.383
Good, then let them rip.

58:06.067 --> 58:08.569
Well done, pathetic scum.

58:08.736 --> 58:09.862
Thanks, Mr. Demon.

58:10.029 --> 58:11.155
We think?

58:11.322 --> 58:12.407
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:18.329 --> 58:19.914
It's over, Crimson Witch.

58:20.081 --> 58:23.584
I'll be taking back
the rock of Kissteria.

58:40.143 --> 58:41.602
Rock, Starchild?

58:44.939 --> 58:50.111
Why settle for the rock,
when you can have the whole mountain?

59:23.853 --> 59:27.815
Arise, Destroyer!

59:27.982 --> 59:29.942
Yo, witchy-poo.

59:31.152 --> 59:33.946
I'm not done yet.

59:34.113 --> 59:35.615
Such arrogance.

59:35.782 --> 59:37.950
You can't defeat me alone.

59:39.160 --> 59:41.621
Just watch me.

01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:15.780
Yes!

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:41.639
Dude, I hope that's my stomach rumbling.

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:43.307
No, look.

01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:50.982
You're too late. Ha-ha-ha!

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:59.157
I go now to watch the destruction
of your beloved Earth.

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:11.377
Farewell, fools.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:18.301
Nice work stopping the witch.

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:19.927
I couldn't beat her on my own.

01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:24.682
You know, the Elder said that the only way
to stop whatever's happening here...

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.726
is with teamwork, right?

01:01:26.893 --> 01:01:28.853
- Right.
- Really?

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.691
Yeah. As much as I hate to admit it,
we need to work together.

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:37.361
Hey, Starchild said that rock 'n' roll
powers everything here.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:41.282
And it was music that created
the rock of Kissteria in the first place.

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.701
So if we create massive music...

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:45.745
Our kind of music...

01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:48.122
We'll overload the Destroyer.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:51.500
Yeah. You guys just need
to make too much rock 'n' roll.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:52.960
Too much rock 'n' roll?

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:54.837
Ain't no such thing.

01:01:55.004 --> 01:01:56.339
Look, you're KISS.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:59.133
If anyone can make
too much rock 'n' roll, it's you.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.053
Then we'll head back to KISS World
and start the concert...

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.305
while you guys distract the Destroyer.

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:05.640
How will we do that?

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:06.974
With this.

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:22.531
Wow, neat.

01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:24.367
We call it the KISS Kraft.

01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:26.661
We have a van
that we call the Mystery Machine.

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:29.997
That's cool, Frank,
but we're running out of time.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.251
It's Fred.

01:02:42.176 --> 01:02:44.011
Quick, get in the KISS car.

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:46.305
KISS Kraft.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.526
Oh. Come on.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:00.194
Oh!

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:01.946
Whoopsy!

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:11.539
You really need to lay off
the Scooby Snacks.

01:03:11.706 --> 01:03:12.873
Huh? Grr.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:31.225
Like, how did I get out here?

01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:40.359
Yes.

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:42.695
Freedom is mine!

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.822
We want KISS!

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:48.576
We want KISS! We want KISS!

01:03:48.743 --> 01:03:50.536
We want KISS!

01:03:50.703 --> 01:03:53.831
We want KISS! We want KISS!

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:57.585
I know the fans want to get in,
but I haven't heard from KISS yet.

01:03:57.752 --> 01:03:59.295
- Where are they...?
- We're here, Goldman.

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.007
Open the gates and let the army in.

01:04:06.135 --> 01:04:08.554
We need to rock 'n' roll.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.225
Ha-ha-ha. Yes.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:15.144
Free at last.

01:04:15.603 --> 01:04:17.438
Free to destroy.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:21.525
Free to swallow the Earth in evil.

01:04:23.152 --> 01:04:25.237
Not so fast, Destroyer.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:27.823
Out of my way, insolent flea.

01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:30.076
Whoa, he is really big.

01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:32.495
Make us, bucket head.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:35.247
All right, KISS World!

01:04:36.499 --> 01:04:38.918
You wanted the best, and you got it.

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:41.295
The hottest band in the world...

01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:43.589
KISS!

01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:56.852
I hate music!

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.196
I feel uptight on Saturday night

01:05:10.366 --> 01:05:13.619
Nine o' clock,
the radio's the only light

01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:18.124
I hear my song and it pulls me through

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.047
Comes on strong,
tells me what I got to do

01:05:25.214 --> 01:05:26.298
I got to

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:29.260
- Get up
- Everybody's gonna move their feet

01:05:29.427 --> 01:05:32.304
- Get down
- Everybody's gonna leave their seat

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:37.726
You gotta lose your mind
In Detroit Rock City

01:05:37.893 --> 01:05:40.563
- Get up
- Everybody's gonna move their feet

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:43.649
- Get down
- Everybody's gonna leave their seat

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:58.038
Heads up.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:21.228
Moving fast, down 95

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.983
Like, step on it, Fred!

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.736
Hit top speed
But I'm still moving much too slow

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:32.490
I feel so good, I'm so alive

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:38.704
I hear my song playing on the radio

01:06:38.871 --> 01:06:40.331
And it goes

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:42.917
- Get up
- Everybody's gonna move their feet

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:46.420
- Get down
- Everybody's gonna leave their seat

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:33.008
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock

01:07:35.594 --> 01:07:38.704
Curse you, KISS!

01:07:41.392 --> 01:07:45.104
Oh, my God, no time to turn

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:51.694
I got to laugh because I know
I'm gonna die, why

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:55.698
- Get up
- Everybody's gonna move their feet

01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:05.666
- Get up
- Everybody's gonna leave their seat

01:08:30.566 --> 01:08:33.444
Shaggy, Scooby, are you awake?

01:08:33.611 --> 01:08:35.029
I think they're coming around.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:38.823
Like, what happened?

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:42.202
- Yeah, what happened?
- You passed out.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.456
I guess at some point,
we all passed out and woke up here.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.582
We just got a report on the residue.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.295
It seems our Crimson Witch
is more of a chemical witch.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:56.091
Her witch haze is really a gas that messes
with your senses and creates illusions.

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:57.843
You mean to tell me...

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.263
It was all a figment
of our imaginations.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.807
Whoa, that's deep.

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:05.059
Yeah, deep.

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:07.770
But what about the Destroyer
and the cosmic realm?

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.604
Yeah, the cosmic realm.

01:09:09.772 --> 01:09:10.981
It never happened.

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.442
We all had what you call
a mass hallucination.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.527
Then who has the rock of Kissteria?

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.571
Yeah, the rock of Kissteria.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.741
Dude, seriously? After everything I say?

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:22.493
Sorry, Shaggy.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:26.537
The Crimson Witch has it,
but not for long.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:35.421
We figured out where she stashed it.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.926
If there's room for you two in here,
there's certainly room for a black diamond.

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:45.849
Give me rock!

01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:06.120
Give me...

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:07.538
Rock.

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.331
We get it.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.349
Look, she hid gas dispensers
in her cape.

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:32.813
Huh?

01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:37.234
And here's the magnetic repulsor-field belt
she used for flying.

01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:38.444
Ooh.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:41.864
Quest Research Laboratories. Good stuff.

01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:47.828
All stolen from her previous employer.

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:01.592
Thanks, Starchild.

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:04.803
KISS has been on witch watch
ever since we passed out.

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.889
So, like, who's the witch?

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:09.808
I thought you'd have guessed
when we opened her locker, Shaggy.

01:11:11.143 --> 01:11:14.313
She's Delilah Domino,
the head of security.

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:16.982
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:19.568
Delilah. I knew it.

01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:22.821
I didn't really know it,
but, you know, I like to be smart.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:24.615
I'm the boss.

01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:28.160
- Curious. I didn't see that coming.
- How did you know?

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:31.538
When Delilah mentioned that she worked
for a government defense company...

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:32.831
we did some research.

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:35.167
Turns out, they specialized in lasers.

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:36.376
So?

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:40.672
- Lasers that use black diamonds, guys.
- She was hoping to steal it from here...

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:44.760
and sell it to a competing defense company
since she was fired from the last one.

01:11:44.927 --> 01:11:48.639
She was also the one stealing your chemicals,
so she could make her witch gas.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:52.100
As head of security, she would've had
another keycard to your lab.

01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:56.605
And while everyone was watching the concert,
she hid the diamond here in her locker.

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:00.776
My plan was perfect.

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:05.239
And I would've gotten away with it too
if it hadn't been for you meddling KISS.

01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:08.700
Er, uh, kids. You meddling kids.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:11.578
Note to self: KISS handcuffs.

01:12:14.248 --> 01:12:16.250
Thanks for helping us
keep the park open.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.086
And thank you for letting us solve
the mystery with you.

01:12:19.253 --> 01:12:21.255
It was interesting.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:23.507
We couldn't have done it without you.

01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:27.344
Yeah, I guess you kids
are okay after all.

01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:28.929
Thanks, Mr. Demon.

01:12:29.096 --> 01:12:31.932
You'll always be the only demon
I'll ever like.

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:33.433
Yeah.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.018
Thanks, Mr. Demon.

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.358
My pleasure.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.987
And even though I'll always remain
an Ascot Five man...

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.281
we wound up being pretty great partners.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.201
Thanks, Scooby gang.

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:54.955
You guys are welcome back
to KISS World anytime.

01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:58.542
Until then, I leave you with a kiss.

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.878
Oh! Heh.

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:06.508
Uh, you know, I think she'd settle
for a handshake or an autograph.

01:13:06.675 --> 01:13:08.677
Hello.

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:10.053
Thank you.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.222
I mean, you're welcome.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:21.648
You could have cut that off a little earlier.
It was kind of gross.

01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:24.943
I mean, I was right there. I was there.

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:29.114
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you say something, Frank?

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.534
Mwah.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.917
Do you know what was the best thing
about this adventure?

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:43.003
The fact that my philosophy
remains intact.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:46.506
There is always a rational explanation.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.512
That is my undeniable, steadfast
and kind of boring philosophy.

01:13:53.847 --> 01:13:55.599
Hold on, Scoob.

01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:59.353
Looks like I still have half a churro
in my pocket.

01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:01.647
It's cold.

01:14:02.314 --> 01:14:03.398
Huh?

01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:07.694
Nice and toasty.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.738
Thanks again, guys.

01:14:10.072 --> 01:14:13.659
Now we gotta get this rock back
to the Elder for safekeeping.

01:14:39.685 --> 01:14:42.729
- Did you see?
- Did you?

01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:51.154
You think we should tell her?

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.993
No. Why rock her world?

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.161
Good point.

01:15:11.383 --> 01:15:13.593
Oh, yeah.
