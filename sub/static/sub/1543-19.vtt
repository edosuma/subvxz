00:05.873 --> 00:08.877
The Mark of Cain
never lets its host die easy.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.851
It's just a curse. It can be removed.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.489
This is purgatory.

00:12.713 --> 00:16.490
There was something about being there.
Most days felt like 360-degree combat.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.220
- Agh!
- It felt pure.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.731
Cuthbert Sinclair.
He was named master of spells.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.232
His work got a little crazy.

00:25.425 --> 00:28.065
The leadership called it
"eccentric and irresponsible."

00:28.262 --> 00:31.175
- We're done.
- So you're choosing the Winchesters.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.679
- I'm choosing me.
- Book of the Damned is a spell book...

00:33.767 --> 00:37.408
...for creating or undoing
any kind of damnation there is.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.448
We translate this, I think we can
get the Mark of Cain off you.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.085
I don't trust you,
but I need help.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.256
I need the Mark of Cain
off of my brother.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.415
Something tells me you can crack this book.
The only question is:

00:48.615 --> 00:49.685
Will you help me?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.294
Shall we discuss terms?

01:08.702 --> 01:09.976
- Hey.
- Get lost.

01:10.203 --> 01:13.446
My show just started.
You've a record player in your room.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.484
- Dad's speakers are better.
- Tough luck.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.985
I need the laundry started.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.558
The workmen have left for the day,
and I have my hands full with dinner.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.492
And please,
none of your Betty Friedan stuff.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.224
It's not fair. I always get stuck with
the chores just because I'm the girl.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.494
Yeah, well, tough luck.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.569
The house is great, Ted.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.073
It's a bit of a fixer,
but it's a real beaut.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.837
It was caught in some ownership muddle
for years...

01:43.070 --> 01:45.812
...but it finally hit
the market and I leapt.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.673
Don't spend all day down there.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.095
Mom?

03:52.632 --> 03:55.476
Dad, where's Mom?

04:04.311 --> 04:05.813
Mom?

04:06.313 --> 04:08.054
- Brad?
- Unh!

04:13.754 --> 04:14.994
Mum!

04:16.322 --> 04:17.563
Mum!

04:17.923 --> 04:20.336
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.007
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.104
Everything's gonna be just fine.

04:43.183 --> 04:48.690
There's only one thing
you could possibly do for me...

04:48.955 --> 04:52.027
...that I can't,
at least presently, do for myself.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.198
Kill my son.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.803
He's expecting it from me.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.880
Already has his stinking minions
on high alert.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.112
If you're wondering how a mother can get
to the point of wanting her own son...

05:08.308 --> 05:10.652
No, I'm really not. I'll do it.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.050
I'll kill Crowley.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.992
First things first.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.490
Can you read the book?

05:16.683 --> 05:18.526
Of course I can.

05:18.718 --> 05:23.724
I'm likely the only witch alive
who can understand such old dark magic.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.896
Just not in its present form.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.634
Drink's on me.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.909
Hey, you're not going anywhere, pal.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.207
I'm your mortal enemy.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.317
I've tried to kill you and your brother.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.512
Your brother as recently as last month.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.419
You wouldn't have come to me
if I wasn't your last resort.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.093
You're desperate. Ha, ha.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.329
You can stop pretending you're not.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.758
So rude.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.067
Now, I can't read the book
in its present form...

06:05.599 --> 06:07.579
...but there is someone who could.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.212
Nadya.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.679
Grand Coven witch.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.608
Where do I find hen'?

06:14.841 --> 06:16.445
You don't. She's dead.

06:17.177 --> 06:21.125
Long ago, murdered for her life's work.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.294
Her decryption formulas, her codex...

06:25.552 --> 06:27.122
...that you can find.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.425
Bring me Nadya's codex...

06:29.623 --> 06:33.901
...and I'll break this text right open...

06:34.094 --> 06:36.631
...and give you your cure.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.803
Where do I look?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.773
If I were you, I'd start at home.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.974
Who do you think murdered Nadya
and stole the codex in the first place?

06:48.775 --> 06:49.810
The Men of Letters.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.780
Ha, ha.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.286
Jackpot.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.319
- Dean.
- Hey.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.957
Hey.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.158
- What happened? What is this?
- I know, right?

07:30.350 --> 07:32.455
Six vamps, solo.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.834
I think that's gotta be a personal best.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.668
- You couldn't have waited?
- For what?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.032
- For what?
- Come on, man.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.831
I can handle it. I did handle it.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.373
- What if you couldn't?
- I did.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.675
It's done.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.279
Come on, it's the only way
I can take the edge off.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.884
I'm sorry.
I don't always like to wait around for you.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.848
- Especially with you looking at me like that.
- Like what?

07:57.043 --> 08:00.547
Like that. Like I'm some sort of
a diseased, killer puppy.

08:02.549 --> 08:06.190
I'm sweaty, I'm covered in vamp juice.
Can we just talk about this later?

08:06.386 --> 08:08.866
I'd like to get back to the bunker,
get my buzz on...

08:09.055 --> 08:11.399
...and pass out
watching Speed 2: Cruise Control.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.065
We cool?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.064
Cool.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.528
Please, let's come to order.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.594
Men of Letter meeting minutes,
May 16th, 1956.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.596
On the matter
of Cuthbert Sinclair expulsion.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.564
This is hardly your first offense.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.635
You've been cited for disciplinary infractions
seven limes in the course of your tenure.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.570
But this enchanted vault of yours...

09:25.765 --> 09:28.473
...this Werther Box...

09:28.768 --> 09:32.477
A warding spell so potent,
it achieves a theoretical rate of...

09:32.739 --> 09:36.152
...in your own words,
"98 percent lethality."

09:36.376 --> 09:38.151
Extreme measures were warranted.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.380
The coven's desperate
to get the codex back.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
The Werther Box works.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.784
All too well, I'd say.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.088
Working in secret...

09:46.286 --> 09:48.789
...embarking on this project
without oversight...

09:48.988 --> 09:52.959
...you left two fellow Men of Letters
vulnerable to your most potent magics.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.629
Fletcher and Martinez were members
in good standing.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.504
Fletcher chanced upon the box
and died in two hours.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.139
Martinez heroically tried to shut it down.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.975
We found him dead on the floor
beside the box...

10:05.171 --> 10:06.275
...his wrist cut.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.810
I already apologized for that accident.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.488
I refuse to do so again.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.919
Why are you all so small-minded?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.297
Hm?

10:24.190 --> 10:25.328
We were brought here...

10:25.925 --> 10:28.997
...to do great things.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.136
To take risks.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.645
To bring the fight
to the monsters of this world.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.009
And yet...

10:39.205 --> 10:43.347
...to a man, you choose instead
to molder in these stacks.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.647
You are not men.

10:44.844 --> 10:47.552
You are not men.

10:49.682 --> 10:50.854
You're librarians.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.996
Nothing more.

10:55.955 --> 10:59.869
Before we rule
on what is to be done with you...

11:00.059 --> 11:02.869
...I'm prepared to give you a chance
to secure our leniency.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.700
Tell us how to shut it down.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.004
The box is still in St. Louis
with the codex. It's still a danger.

11:21.748 --> 11:25.924
Let me tell you what you can do
with your leniency, Markham.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.197
You know, I saw the writing on the wall.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.773
I knew you cowards
would shut this project down.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.012
Which is why I built it the way I did.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.914
There is only one way...

11:44.103 --> 11:45.946
...to silence the Werther for good.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.413
Let's just say
Martinez was on the right track.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.123
I doubt you lot have the guts,
but you're welcome to die trying.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.229
Markham...

11:59.419 --> 12:01.126
...would you have us keep trying?

12:02.789 --> 12:05.395
The box is to be interred and guarded
where it stands.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.572
In perpetuity.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.398
Bury it.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.285
It's a bit early.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.158
I'm over 300 years old.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.796
Beauty sleep isn't optional.

13:06.986 --> 13:10.593
I've been looking into the,
uh, thing we discussed.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.201
So I got a lead...

13:12.458 --> 13:14.870
...but it's guarded
by a violent enchantment.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.871
I need a spell to break the spell.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.509
The Cabirian Invocation.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.976
Easy to obtain,
good all-purpose disenchantment.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.204
Great, thanks.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.507
But it's not recommended for amateurs.

13:26.706 --> 13:31.883
In inexperienced hands,
the invocation has a way of fizzling out.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.852
I could come.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.818
You might need me.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.394
I'll take my chances. Thanks.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.687
- Whoa.
- Bad idea.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.926
- I can explain.
- Yeah, don't bother.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.429
You got three choices.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.432
Get arrested,
get your bits blown off, or get back.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.067
Yeah, all right. I think
I'll, uh, get back.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.265
- Sorry.
- Attaboy.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.217
Ahem. Hey, Sammy.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.089
How's the case?

14:50.957 --> 14:52.800
What are you doing here?

14:53.059 --> 14:56.905
Well, it looks like I, uh...
I'm here to save your sack.

14:57.296 --> 15:01.767
Look, you were right, okay?
I shouldn't have gone off solo like I did.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.743
It was stupid.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.817
- And?
- And selfish. It was a douche move.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.919
If you're doing this case by yourself
to teach me a lesson...

15:12.111 --> 15:13.920
...you don't have to, okay?

15:16.315 --> 15:17.658
- How'd you find me?
- Ah.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.931
I took an etching off your notepad.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.504
Then I decided to take a crack
at the St. Louis suicide house.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.465
So you know about it?

15:31.664 --> 15:35.168
I got the basics from Google.
A family moves into a long-vacant house...

15:36.269 --> 15:39.148
...one week later,
three of them dead by their own hands.

15:39.505 --> 15:42.645
Whole family wiped out except for the
daughter. House is still under her name.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.345
Figured she's the one
who nearly unmanned you.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.457
See, here's what I don't get.
I mean, a cold case is one thing...

15:49.649 --> 15:50.787
...but this is subzero.

15:50.983 --> 15:55.261
This is nothing even in our wheelhouse.
Unless you know something I don't.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.703
Yeah. Um, ahem.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.637
That long-vacant home?

16:02.829 --> 16:05.969
Used to be a Men of Letters'
chapter house.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.011
Remember Magnus?

16:08.201 --> 16:11.307
The dickwad that tried to make
a zoo exhibit out of me? Yeah.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.542
Before he was expelled,
he built Werther...

16:14.774 --> 16:18.153
...a magical box
with a deadly alarm system.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.654
Werther is buried
somewhere in that house.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.447
It was supposed to be guarded,
but the plan went out the window...

16:23.616 --> 16:26.859
...when Abaddon massacred
the entire membership in '58.

16:27.053 --> 16:31.058
And then the house stayed in limbo
until some lucky family bought it.

16:31.891 --> 16:35.395
Werther is a time bomb,
and it needs to be defused.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.067
Not only is this in our wheelhouse,
it's our responsibility.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.209
- Our responsibility?
- We're Men of Letters.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.209
It's our legacy.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.081
Well, if you say this is a case...

16:46.339 --> 16:47.409
...I'm in.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.409
If you'll have me.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.020
What did I say?

17:00.219 --> 17:01.823
It's... Ah.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.391
You're not...

17:06.392 --> 17:07.426
Fella tried to...

17:09.095 --> 17:10.438
What do you want?

17:11.329 --> 17:12.365
You saw him?

17:12.565 --> 17:13.907
Oh, tell me you did.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.209
My name is Dwight Twilley,
I'm with the Neighborhood Watch.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.247
We're looking into a few break-ins,
and if you saw the guy...

17:20.439 --> 17:23.420
...and you could give a description,
it would be mighty helpful.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.781
If I could just have a minute of your time?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.452
Uh...

17:31.083 --> 17:34.462
- Tall, white fella, pretty hair.
- Mm-hm.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.476
It's a nice house you have here...

17:50.136 --> 17:51.638
- Suzie.
- Suzie.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.906
You live alone?

17:53.472 --> 17:54.610
Just me and Gus.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.245
Gus?

18:28.174 --> 18:30.916
So all alone in this big house, huh?
Must get lonely.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.188
Even with, uh, Gus.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.022
Yeah, well, I'm used to alone.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.365
No, no, I'm fine, thanks.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.718
Been alone here since...

19:12.184 --> 19:13.356
...'80.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.225
After my family died,
my Aunt Pauline moved in.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.869
She took care of me,
raised me for a few years.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.072
Then, well...

19:33.906 --> 19:38.355
So, what happened to your aunt?

19:40.546 --> 19:42.025
Well...

19:44.517 --> 19:47.555
...I told her not to go in the basement.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.560
No one goes in the basement.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.244
What's in the basement, Suzie?

20:22.588 --> 20:24.568
Ma'am, you okay?

20:34.934 --> 20:38.905
- Whoa. Suzie.
- My social skills may be rusty...

20:39.105 --> 20:40.140
...but I'm no idiot.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.088
Doorbell hasn't rung in months...

20:44.276 --> 20:46.153
...and two visitors in one hour?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.457
One breaking in...

20:48.647 --> 20:51.958
...the other asking all sorts of questions.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.290
I told you,
I was from the Neighborhood Watch.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.966
Yeah, Neighborhood Watch, right.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.328
Boy, you seen this house?

20:59.291 --> 21:01.931
There's only one thing in here
worth getting at...

21:02.128 --> 21:03.971
...and it sure as hell ain't me.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.165
- Okay.
- You came for the box.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.179
Whoever left that godforsaken thing
down there...

21:15.841 --> 21:18.287
I knew someday
someone would come for it.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.582
I swore never to let that happen.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.185
He's downstairs, isn't he?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.859
He's my brother,
and we're here to help you.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.626
You call him up here.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.859
Now!

21:33.092 --> 21:34.503
You call him up here!

21:34.693 --> 21:36.104
- Now!
- Sam.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.041
Sammy.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.046
She wants you up here now.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.323
No.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.996
No.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.221
Get out!

22:01.487 --> 22:02.522
Get out!

22:02.721 --> 22:03.893
Out, out!

22:04.390 --> 22:05.664
You bastards!

22:05.991 --> 22:07.129
You let it out!

22:20.039 --> 22:21.074
Dean!

22:23.142 --> 22:24.917
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.919
You have any idea what you've done?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.386
Put the gun down.
We can talk about this, okay?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.858
- What's that?
- Hey, Suzie.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.088
- You miss me?
- Oh, my God.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.424
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.064
Stay back.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.899
- Stay back!
- Go.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.534
Come on, Suze.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.539
Is that any way to treat your family?

23:04.950 --> 23:06.691
Hello, Suzie.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.764
What are we gonna do? Huh?

23:14.960 --> 23:17.133
You don't have a plan,
you don'! have a defense.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.446
- No.
- You did this to us.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.280
You let it out.

23:30.309 --> 23:32.311
We died while you slept.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.584
No!

23:35.781 --> 23:37.419
Suzie.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.998
Suzie?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.643
Please, slop.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.507
Stop.

23:57.736 --> 23:58.840
Stop.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.811
Suzie!

24:01.941 --> 24:03.818
Suzie, let me in, I can help you.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.654
- Stop.
- You don't have to be sad...

24:07.846 --> 24:09.655
...and you don't have to be alone.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.156
Suzie, please.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.956
- Not anymore.
- Suzie? Hey.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.827
- Let me in, I can help you, okay?
- Stop. Please, stop.

24:17.022 --> 24:18.660
Suzie?

24:19.325 --> 24:20.531
Dean?

24:36.275 --> 24:37.811
Sam?

24:49.888 --> 24:51.561
Suzie?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.346
Crap.

25:13.545 --> 25:14.990
Boo.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.562
Survived 40 years in this house...

25:18.917 --> 25:21.397
...keeping that thing on lockdown...

25:21.587 --> 25:23.828
...and one visit from a putz like you...

25:24.023 --> 25:25.400
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.730
Lot of good sorry does me. Look at me.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.273
Look at me.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.607
There she is.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.440
The first casualty
of your misguided mission.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.751
But what's another human life to you?

25:41.940 --> 25:43.214
Anything's worth it...

25:43.409 --> 25:45.616
...long as you two make it out alive.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.757
And how's that search going?

25:49.948 --> 25:52.087
Any closer to a cure?

25:52.284 --> 25:53.627
This isn't real.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.562
You're not real.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.605
You think Dean's the wild card,
the loose cannon.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.068
But don't you see?

26:03.262 --> 26:06.937
Making deals with witches,
opening Pandora's box down there.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.941
You're the reckless one.

26:09.134 --> 26:13.139
You'll do anything to keep clinging
to that doomed brother of yours.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.615
How many more will die, Sammy?

26:16.308 --> 26:18.914
You know it.
You have to be stopped.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.648
And the only one
who can stop you is you.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.915
Do it, Sammy!

26:23.248 --> 26:25.455
End this farce once and for all!

26:31.657 --> 26:33.637
Told you you'd need me.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.472
How did you find me?

26:43.669 --> 26:45.671
Same way I just saved you.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.173
Magic.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.441
Had a feeling
you might be in over your head.

26:49.641 --> 26:50.676
You can't be here.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.016
If Dean sees you...

26:55.681 --> 26:57.957
- Dean?
- Sam?

26:59.685 --> 27:01.926
Hey, Dean, what are you doing?

27:29.014 --> 27:30.049
Hey, chief.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.327
No. No, it can't be you.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.556
Hey, hey, hey.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.191
Wake up!

27:38.857 --> 27:41.030
Dean, whatever you're seeing,
it's not real.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.365
- Real enough to him.
- What are you doing?

27:43.562 --> 27:45.542
He can't see me, Sam.

27:46.865 --> 27:47.969
He's too far gone.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.202
Can you wake him up?

27:49.401 --> 27:53.042
I only brought enough magic for one.
Maybe if you'd told me we'd have company...

27:53.238 --> 27:54.376
- There is no "we."
- Fine.

27:54.573 --> 27:58.487
Take this all on by yourself, but the
odds are totally stacked against you.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.247
You're not real.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.254
Oh, spell's got its hooks in deep.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.017
If you want him woken up...

28:04.216 --> 28:06.560
...you'll have to rip this enchantment
by the root.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.095
The box.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.891
If we figure out the fail safe,
we can break the spell and get the codex.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.367
Suzie's hallucinations drove her to
suicide. Same thing with her family.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.641
Werther's illusions
tried to do the same thing to me.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.744
- And so?
- So I can't leave Dean alone like this.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.269
Well, then...

28:25.237 --> 28:27.774
...we'll just have to tie up the bonny lad.

28:28.774 --> 28:30.276
Could be fun.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.783
Come on, Dean.
How long you gonna keep this up?

28:33.011 --> 28:34.285
The silent treatment for me?

28:34.546 --> 28:37.288
- We got so much to catch up on.
- Hey, look.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.588
It's good to see you, okay? It is.
But like I said, you ain't Benny.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.391
I'm not?

28:43.589 --> 28:44.624
Well, shoot.

28:44.856 --> 28:47.393
Yeah, I'm bummed out too,
but you are just a figment.

28:47.593 --> 28:52.599
Subconscious junk my brain's throwing up to
distract me from getting back to reality.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.436
Pigment? Junk?

28:54.633 --> 28:57.136
Well, I'll try not to be offended.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.242
But why not trust me?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.714
I've gotten you out before.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.548
Besides, if all I am
is your subconscious junk...

29:05.744 --> 29:08.156
...well, then, how can I lead you wrong?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.460
Well, how about that?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.130
A perfect circle.

29:14.319 --> 29:15.957
Don't look at me, chief.

29:16.321 --> 29:17.425
You chose the way.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.610
Here it is.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.811
There's some kind of inscription.

29:40.012 --> 29:44.017
It's some kind of cursive,
but the light source has dimmed.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.830
I know what I've said about your kind...

29:47.019 --> 29:48.794
...but the man who came up with this?

29:49.321 --> 29:52.666
The craftsmanship of the box,
the sadism of the spell work...

29:52.858 --> 29:54.838
...it's all so...

29:55.027 --> 29:57.473
...deliciously baroque.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.298
All right, come on.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.321
Well, now that is just creepy.

30:17.382 --> 30:20.522
Benny, whoever you are,
I need to get out of here.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.632
Need and want are two different things,
ain't they?

30:25.190 --> 30:26.726
It's all a figment, right?

30:26.992 --> 30:29.734
You, me, left, right.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.241
But no matter which way you turn,
you keep ending up here.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.842
You gotta wonder.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.236
Why this figment?

30:38.737 --> 30:40.580
Why this place?

30:42.207 --> 30:43.242
What are you saying?

30:43.475 --> 30:45.716
Nothing you don't already know.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.056
This is where you wanna be.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.726
Your happy place.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.225
And you don't really wanna leave.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.102
To silence the box.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.732
Ah.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.675
Slake its thirst...

31:10.736 --> 31:13.774
...with the blood of our own.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.681
That's it?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.785
The blood of its own what?

31:20.445 --> 31:22.083
The blood of our own.

31:25.450 --> 31:26.588
Men of Letters blood.

31:27.753 --> 31:28.788
Legacy blood.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.631
My blood.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.401
Oh.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.104
Remember what you said to me
when we first met?

31:40.298 --> 31:43.074
About the purity of this place?

31:43.735 --> 31:44.975
Dean...

31:45.237 --> 31:46.910
...slow down.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.415
Dean, stop.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.480
Listen.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.317
This?

31:58.984 --> 32:02.329
This place, you don't have to go
looking for a fight.

32:03.789 --> 32:07.100
All you have to do is be still
for one moment...

32:07.459 --> 32:09.996
...and that fight will come to you.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.837
That's why you're here, Dean.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.003
That's the purity you crave.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.673
Killing with no consequence.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.147
No, Benny.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.755
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I'm tired of fighting.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.016
The Mark ain't.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.490
So...

32:34.686 --> 32:37.963
...you can't leave, don't wanna stay.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.833
Bit of a bind, ain't it?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.540
Good thing there's always
a third way out.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.543
You can't say
you haven't been thinking about it.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.008
That ain't gonna happen, ever.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.711
Come on, Dean.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.556
I know you can see it.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.350
The purity, the honor.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.027
There's no honor in that.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.857
You just wanna wait
for the Mark to reclaim you?

33:08.053 --> 33:10.727
Go out swinging, die topside, then what?

33:11.056 --> 33:13.559
Maybe kill a few humans, kill Cass,
kill your brother?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.499
- That's mighty honorable.
- Shut up.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.367
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot...

33:17.562 --> 33:19.701
...about your plan.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.869
You gonna get Sam and Cass
to put you down?

33:24.035 --> 33:27.346
You really think they're gonna
keep that agreement? Come on.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.413
Dean, let's say they do.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.719
Do you think they will ever recover
from that?

33:37.048 --> 33:39.255
It will ruin them.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.833
This little back-up plan of yours, I know
you've been thinking about it for a time.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.899
I know it's been gnawing at you.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.035
You can't leave that job to them.

34:00.238 --> 34:01.581
You're right.

34:05.410 --> 34:08.550
Out there, you're sleeping.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.125
You make the right choice in here...

34:11.949 --> 34:13.224
...you'll sleep forever.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.632
And you won't ever hurt anyone
ever again.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.304
No one needs to know, Dean.

34:27.866 --> 34:31.973
What happens in purgatory
stays in purgatory.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.677
How do you know this'll work?

35:07.138 --> 35:08.173
I don't.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.663
Hey.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.504
It's working.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.380
I always did love it here.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.979
It's as good a place as any
to call it a day, huh?

35:52.183 --> 35:54.026
Slow down.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.563
Right. Okay.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.566
No, no, no.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.400
It wants more, Sam.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.740
It wants it all.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.742
The codex.

36:12.303 --> 36:15.580
The path to the cure, it's in there.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.415
If it wants more, it'll get more.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.231
I'd do it.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.738
If I really had to...

36:42.934 --> 36:44.607
...I would.

36:46.171 --> 36:50.449
But the real Benny would never let me.

36:50.675 --> 36:52.848
We already covered that, chief.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.113
It's not me.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.950
You know what else won't let me?

36:57.182 --> 37:00.561
This thing on my arm.

37:05.623 --> 37:08.627
For better or worse, the Mark...

37:09.260 --> 37:11.706
...it wants me alive.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.320
Thanks, pal...

37:27.645 --> 37:29.647
...but no, thanks.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.233
It's opening, Sammy.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.409
It's nearly there.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.407
Sam!

37:56.174 --> 37:57.619
Hey. Hey, hey.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.178
Sammy, whatever you're seeing,
it's a trick.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.651
Okay? It's not real.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.154
Dean.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.325
Hey. No, no. Hey.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.758
Hey.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.330
Unh! Get away from me.

38:11.523 --> 38:14.197
Don't. Don't. Dean, it's the only way.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.163
It needs legacy blood.
Enough to take a life.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.174
Yeah, well...

38:19.364 --> 38:22.641
...it doesn't have to come from
just one legacy, does it?

38:23.201 --> 38:25.374
If it needs more blood, it can have mine.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.199
Oh, well.

39:30.401 --> 39:31.744
Overkill, don't you think?

39:31.936 --> 39:33.279
I mean, we broke the spell...

39:33.504 --> 39:35.450
...the box is just a box.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.210
Well, now it's scrap metal.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.715
You Okay?

39:42.780 --> 39:44.282
Yeah, I'm great.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.418
You road ready?

39:46.751 --> 39:48.094
I'll be fine.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.788
That says something, doesn't it?

39:50.121 --> 39:53.364
Werther splits us up and within an hour,
we're on the brink of death.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.935
Sorry about yesterday,
going rogue like that.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.471
You know what, Dean, don't apologize.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.944
I think that makes us even.

40:06.371 --> 40:09.648
Universe is trying to tell us something
we both should already know.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.648
We're stronger together than apart.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.291
Now, what could possibly be so valuable...

40:17.482 --> 40:21.055
...that it takes a spell that nasty
to protect it, huh?

40:21.953 --> 40:23.626
No idea.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.969
Whatever it is...

40:27.158 --> 40:29.160
...we'll keep it safe.

40:40.338 --> 40:43.410
Well, hello, cowboy.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.418
Oh, you've got it.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.790
Is it enough?

40:56.521 --> 40:57.591
To what?

40:57.789 --> 41:00.861
To translate the book,
find a cure for the Mark.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.694
Oh, aye.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.506
Good.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.935
What in the hell is this?

41:09.167 --> 41:10.373
Insurance.

41:12.337 --> 41:13.543
Comfortable?

41:13.805 --> 41:17.184
We had an agreement, giant.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.851
The agreement stands.

41:20.044 --> 41:23.389
You'll decrypt the Book of the Damned
and find me a cure for my brother.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.220
And that is all you'll get from the book.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.530
I'll burn the book, and I'll kill Crowley.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.023
- But until then...
- I'm your slave?

41:34.892 --> 41:37.372
You can't... You can't just leave me here.

41:38.963 --> 41:42.206
You want out?
Hurry up and get to work.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.711
Oh, you big bampot!
