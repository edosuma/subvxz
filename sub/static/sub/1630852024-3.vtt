WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:10.010
There's this old folk tale
I think would make
for a good story.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.707
It's called
"The Devil's Holiday."

00:11.750 --> 00:15.580
And in it the devil
visits a small town

00:17.104 --> 00:19.323
[scoffs] in order
to collect lost souls

00:19.367 --> 00:22.805
and sow the seeds
of destruction and despair.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.633
Yeah, here it is.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.680
Now, there are many different

00:28.724 --> 00:30.682
versions of this folk tale,
but in the one I'm imagining,

00:30.726 --> 00:32.684
the name of the town is
Rivervale,

00:32.728 --> 00:37.341
and the devil that visits it
can take any number of guises.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.693
[music playing over speakers]

00:43.130 --> 00:45.349
No, no, you keep that

00:45.393 --> 00:47.221
and pay me next time, Jim.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.222
Thank you, Pop.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.397
God bless you.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.357
You have the biggest heart
I know, Grandpa.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.098
Well, I don't know about that.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.143

Oh, my God. Grandpa!

01:18.165 --> 01:19.601
[clock ticking]

01:22.125 --> 01:25.215
Reggie, what are you doing?

01:26.042 --> 01:27.304
Can't sleep.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.091
Are you nervous
about the casino opening?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.876
Must be, yeah.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.921
Don't worry.

01:35.965 --> 01:40.317
This is gonna be the biggest
thing to happen to Rivervale
since maple syrup.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.407
I love you.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.541
I love you, Veronica.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.111
I love you, too, Reggie.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.426

02:05.212 --> 02:06.474

02:06.517 --> 02:08.215
[man on phone]
We got him, Betty.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.781
Go on. Got who?

02:09.825 --> 02:12.175
[Glen on phone]
TBK. The Trash Bag Killer.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.048
Where... where... where is he?

02:16.092 --> 02:18.790
Being transported to Rivervale
as we're speaking.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.141
I need to get you two
in the same room.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.273
Hold on. What? Why?
Why me?

02:23.317 --> 02:25.101
I need a confession
out of him.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.537
And he says
you're the only one
he'll speak to.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.235
You, and you alone.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.411
Are you up for this?

02:32.326 --> 02:35.981
Yeah. Yes, I'm in.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.507
Our call with the
Gaming Control Board
got moved till 2:00.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.205
So you'll have to take lead
at the staff meeting.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.904
No problem, Ronnie,
but we need to hear this.

02:45.948 --> 02:49.647
Rivervale's new casino,
aptly named Babylonium,

02:49.691 --> 02:52.172
is nothing short
of an abomination.

02:52.215 --> 02:56.611
If this house of sin
is allowed to open as planned,

02:56.654 --> 03:00.441
our fair town will be
damned and doomed.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.662
You think she's going
to be a problem?

03:04.706 --> 03:10.102
Oh, spare me
the spin, Veronica.
Casinos breed evil-doing.

03:10.146 --> 03:15.020
First come the gamblers,
then the harlots,
and then the whore mongers.

03:15.064 --> 03:20.591
Alice, we're running
this casino like
a corporation, which it is.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.593
It's completely legitimate.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.030
None of what we do here
is legit.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.555
This place was built
for one reason alone,

03:27.598 --> 03:30.514
to separate the players
and their money.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.821
Every table, wheel,
and slot machine

03:32.864 --> 03:35.040
has been calibrated
to maximize profits.

03:35.084 --> 03:38.783
Truly, we're following
every rule and regulation
to the letter.

03:38.827 --> 03:44.354
[Reggie] Tipped roulette
wheels, phony dice,
magnetized slot machines.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.877
We put limits on drinks.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.923
[Reggie] Ply them with booze
all night long.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.708
And, of course,
Gaming Control Board agents

03:50.752 --> 03:52.971
will be checking our receipts
every month.

03:53.015 --> 03:56.627
When delivering the chips
to the counting room,
scoop one third off the top,

03:56.671 --> 03:58.542
that's our weekly skim money.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.719
What we use
to pay the politicians,

04:01.763 --> 04:05.897
banks and union leaders
to look the other way.

04:05.941 --> 04:09.640
Here's an idea.
Why don't you come to our
soft opening tonight?

04:09.684 --> 04:12.208
Check out the place,
see what we're really about.

04:12.252 --> 04:17.257
I think you'll find
we're not quite the house
of the devil you're imagining.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.781
Hmm.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.349
[EKG machine beeping]

04:27.963 --> 04:28.964
Good evening, Ms. Tate.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.272
It's a pleasure to
finally meet you.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.843
I'm sorry, but who are you?

04:38.887 --> 04:40.541
I go by many names.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.369
Today it's Mr. Cypher.

04:42.412 --> 04:47.287
But since I'm such
an old family friend,
you can call me Lou.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.291
I'm here for
your grandfather's soul.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.772
His... soul? [chuckles]

04:54.816 --> 04:56.296
So what, that would
make you...

04:58.080 --> 04:58.994
[gasps]

04:59.037 --> 05:00.822
Prince of Darkness. Yes.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.696
My grandfather would never
sell his soul to you.

05:05.740 --> 05:11.136
True. Terrence Tate wouldn't.

05:11.180 --> 05:17.447
However, his father,
your great-grandfather,
was less principled.

05:17.491 --> 05:22.365
He sold his eternal soul
to ensure the success
of your family diner.

05:22.409 --> 05:26.630
Okay, but what does that have
to do with my grandfather?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.415
When Terrence learned
what his father had done,

05:28.458 --> 05:31.809
he couldn't bear the thought
of dear old Dad
spending eternity

05:31.853 --> 05:34.072
in the fiery pits
of hell, so...

05:35.596 --> 05:40.252
So he offered his soul
to save his father's.

05:40.296 --> 05:45.954
Yes. Which leads us... to you.

05:45.997 --> 05:49.000
You want my soul
in exchange for Pop's?

05:50.611 --> 05:53.353
Not at all. Just the diner.

05:53.396 --> 05:57.313
And then your sweet
grandfather will be free
of his obligation to me.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.575
The diner.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.795
That's it?

06:00.838 --> 06:01.926
That's it.

06:03.798 --> 06:08.106
Think it over, Ms. Tate,
and let me know.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.847
But don't take too long.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.850
Your grandfather's heart
is liable to give out
at any minute.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.748
Hey, you.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.402
Hi.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.448
How's Pop?

06:45.492 --> 06:49.539
[sighing] He's stable,
at least.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.106
How are you?
Are you okay?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.588
Unsettled.

06:54.631 --> 07:00.463
[sighs] This stranger
showed up at the hospital
with a claim on Pop's soul.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.858
Does this mean he's...

07:04.772 --> 07:06.687
So it would appear.

07:06.730 --> 07:12.257
But he's willing
to release Pop's soul
in exchange for the diner.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.564
What does the devil want
with the Chock'lit Shoppe?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.131
I have no idea.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.569
Mind if I ask him?

07:19.613 --> 07:20.831
Maybe some other questions.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.661
By all means.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.490
Now, remember, this isn't
our official opening,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.449
but we still
need to be on point.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.581
Any questions?

Good. It's go time, then.

You look divine.

-Cute.
-Let's get you a drink and over
to the blackjack table.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.696
Oh, I'm not here
to drink or gamble, Veronica.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.481
I'm here to sniff out evil.

08:01.524 --> 08:05.093
In that case,
how about we seat you
close to the stage

08:05.136 --> 08:07.182
and get you
a cranberry spritzer?

08:07.225 --> 08:09.010
You'll want a prime seat
for the floorshow.

08:25.243 --> 08:30.205
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to intrude,
but are you Kevin Keller?

08:32.555 --> 08:34.165
Ah, I thought it was you.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.472
I caught a performance of yours
in New York

08:36.516 --> 08:37.429
a few years back.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.519
You were terrific.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.172
You should be on Broadway.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.043

08:43.218 --> 08:45.307
Yeah. Fat chance.

I don't even have an agent.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.179
That's absurd.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.836
What if I say that I could
make that happen for you?

13:38.295 --> 13:41.864
-My boss wants
a confession from you.
-Hmm.

13:41.908 --> 13:46.913
He wants you to admit
to all of the atrocious things
in here.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.176
That's what your boss wants.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.569
But what do you want, Betty?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.791
I don't give a damn
about a confession.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.880
I know you did these things.

13:57.924 --> 14:01.928
I just want to know...
does evil,

14:01.971 --> 14:07.890
absolute evil... exist?

14:09.674 --> 14:11.111
And are you it?

14:11.154 --> 14:14.027
Ask your real question, Betty,

14:14.070 --> 14:17.508
and then I will
confess my sins.

14:17.552 --> 14:21.164
I don't have to play
these mind games with you.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.557
[takes deep breath]

14:22.600 --> 14:26.169
No one cares that
you're here. [chuckles]

14:26.213 --> 14:30.913
So you can sit in your filth
for all I care.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.915
And I'll just
come back tomorrow.

14:35.875 --> 14:41.924
Yes, Betty,
absolute evil exists.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.014
And yes, there's a part of you

14:45.058 --> 14:51.499
that is absolutely 100% evil.

14:51.542 --> 14:57.418
You're caked in it.
It's what draws us
to each other.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.076
[breathing heavily]

15:11.562 --> 15:13.695
You've got to get this guy
out of Rivervale, Glen.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.741
I'm not getting
any information out of him.

15:16.785 --> 15:21.572
Uh, he's toying with me,
and I just won't be
his plaything again.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.662
Betty, what in God's name
are you talking about?

15:24.706 --> 15:25.750
Who's toying with you?

15:25.794 --> 15:27.752
TBK, Glen.

15:27.796 --> 15:32.322
Or is there another
serial killer in custody
that you want me to interview?

15:32.366 --> 15:37.588
Betty, the Trash Bag Killer
is not in custody.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
Hey, are you okay?
Do...[sighs]

15:39.677 --> 15:41.636
Do I need
to come up to Rivervale
and check on you?

15:42.811 --> 15:44.247
I'll call you back, Glen.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.731
[EKG machine beeping]

15:53.865 --> 15:55.563
Grandpa, you're awake.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.609
Did you see him?

16:00.568 --> 16:01.612
Yes.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.224
But I'm making
a new deal with him.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.488
Your soul
in exchange for the diner.

16:09.055 --> 16:13.494
You... can't sell
the diner, Tabitha.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.976
Grandpa, it's bricks
and plaster.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.979
It's so much more
than that, honey.

16:20.022 --> 16:26.289
Over the years,
it's become a refuge
for the lost and persecuted.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.944
That's why the devil wants it.

16:28.988 --> 16:36.691
Pops is the soul of Rivervale,
which he wants to destroy,

16:36.734 --> 16:40.434
and that's why
you cannot let him have it.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.660
Mr. Cypher.

16:49.704 --> 16:53.229
Hi, Veronica Lodge calling
with a counter proposal.

16:53.273 --> 16:57.451
There's an old friend of mine
who I've invited
to Babylonium tonight,

16:57.494 --> 16:59.496
and I suspect
you'll find his soul

16:59.540 --> 17:02.325
much more deserving
of damnation than Reggie's.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.458
[Mr. Cypher]
Color me intrigued,
Ms. Lodge.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.025
I'll see you tonight.

17:08.679 --> 17:09.550
[sighs]

17:12.074 --> 17:14.250
Are you surprised
that I called you here,
Mr. Cypher?

17:14.294 --> 17:17.123
Nothing surprises me
these days, Mr. Jones.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.127
I've been looking for something
to inspire my writing,

17:21.170 --> 17:24.826
to get my
creative juices flowing.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.958
And I figured an interview
with the devil
would do just that,

17:27.002 --> 17:30.049
but I'm... I'm... I'm not
gonna sell my soul for it.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.354
Okay?

17:31.398 --> 17:32.573
I see.

17:32.616 --> 17:37.186
Well, huh,
I'll grant you this exclusive

17:37.230 --> 17:40.407
if you agree
to one of these terms.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.063
We do the interview,
you publish it,

17:44.106 --> 17:48.763
you receive all the fame
and notoriety we all yearn for.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.200
But afterwards,

17:51.244 --> 17:52.854
you'll never be able
to write again.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.944
Or?

17:55.987 --> 18:01.776
Or I'll give you this raw,
mind-blowing tell-all,

18:01.819 --> 18:05.127
but everything I say
remains between us.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.607
You can't publish a word.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.261
In fact, you may never
publish anything again,

18:08.304 --> 18:11.307
but you'll find
your creative juices

18:11.351 --> 18:13.440
flowing like Niagara Falls.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
I agree to your terms.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.402
I only ask that you allow me
to choose my option

18:19.446 --> 18:20.795
after we conclude
the interview.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.232
That seems fair.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.415
Please start at the beginning.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.164
He's here, Ronnie.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.296
[sighs]

18:44.993 --> 18:50.607
Nick St. Clair. All grown up,
but still a sleazeball.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.306
We'll just let him get nice
and liquored up first.

18:58.006 --> 19:01.705
And there you have it,
the story of my life

19:01.749 --> 19:06.449
and all the universe's
mysteries revealed.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.845
So, what'll it be?

19:10.888 --> 19:16.285
Publish and never write again,
or file it away forever

19:16.329 --> 19:22.248
and happily scribble away
in obscurity
for the rest of your days?

19:22.291 --> 19:26.861
Option one. I need
to publish this interview.

19:26.904 --> 19:30.169
And receive all the fame
and glory
that will come from it.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.215
[whispers] Fabulous.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.087
Darling Nicky, you made it.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.915
Of course.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.656
You know I could never
turn down an invitation
from you, Ronnie.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.965
Even though
I am happily married.

19:44.008 --> 19:50.711
Remember, Senator,
what happens in Babylonium...
stays in Babylonium.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.062
So, catch me up, Nicky.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.542
It's been years.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.199
I'm assuming you're still
a very naughty boy.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.723
[chuckles] I plead the Fifth.

20:03.767 --> 20:04.855
Come on, Nicky.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.249
-Don't get shy on me.
-[glasses clink]

20:08.729 --> 20:09.730
What can I say?

20:10.557 --> 20:14.387
Details are a turn-on for me.

20:14.430 --> 20:18.913
The more specific you are,
the more hot
and bothered I get.

20:21.132 --> 20:25.876
Well, in that case,
I haven't paid taxes in years.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.270
And I drink and drive
two to three times a week.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.359
Any hit-and-runs?

20:31.273 --> 20:32.535
Three.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.233
-All covered up.
-What about harassment?

20:34.276 --> 20:37.105
Oh, I've lost count
of how many NDAs
my lawyers have arranged

20:37.148 --> 20:39.629
for my staff and interns.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.674
Affairs?

20:42.153 --> 20:44.373
You mean, besides the one
I'm about to start with you?

20:44.417 --> 20:48.986
Cutting to the chase,
would you say that you deserve
the hot burning fires of hell?

20:49.030 --> 20:51.032
As long as
you're holding the pitchfork.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.687
Would you sell your soul
to the devil for me?

20:55.993 --> 20:57.299
Whatever it takes.

20:57.995 --> 20:58.996
[chuckles]

20:59.867 --> 21:01.042
Is that good enough?

21:02.435 --> 21:03.697
Is what good enough?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.135
[Mr. Cypher] Yes.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.571
In this instance,

21:08.615 --> 21:10.617
that qualifies
as a verbal binding agreement.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.837
[Nick screaming]

21:13.881 --> 21:15.448
Goodbye, Senator.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.453
I'm glad our deal
worked out, Mr. Cypher.

21:20.496 --> 21:24.761
Indeed. I will not touch
a hair on Reginald's head.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.633
But you and I are still on
for tomorrow, of course.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.289
What do you mean?

21:31.028 --> 21:32.334
Our business is done.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.641
Reginald's soul
was never on the table,

21:34.684 --> 21:36.425
it was your soul
that I was promised.

21:37.818 --> 21:38.906
Mine?

21:39.602 --> 21:41.212
How is that possible?

21:41.256 --> 21:43.998
Hmm. You might want to ask
your partner that question.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.838
Publish...

21:59.927 --> 22:01.494
or perish?

22:11.025 --> 22:12.026
[keyboard clicks]

22:13.767 --> 22:14.855
[chimes]

22:19.425 --> 22:21.122
[Betty] New question.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.950
Who are you?

22:22.993 --> 22:25.518
Because you're sure as hell
not TBK.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.695
I'm the devil, Betty.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.569
Okay. So if evil exists,

22:33.613 --> 22:36.355
-and you're the devil...
-[softly] Mmm.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.531
hell is a real place then?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.447
Oh, yes.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.840
Well, tell me, is my dad there?

22:43.884 --> 22:45.059
He is.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.063
So, if I asked you
to prove to me

22:49.106 --> 22:51.370
that what you're saying
is true...

22:54.111 --> 22:56.026
could I speak to my father?

23:03.904 --> 23:06.254
[gasps in Hal 's voice]
Betty?

23:06.297 --> 23:08.343
-Betty, what's happening?
-Dad.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.258
Betty, where am I?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.868
You have to get me out of here.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.783
Betty, it hurts.
It hurts so bad!

23:13.827 --> 23:16.873
If it's really you, Dad,
I need you to focus, okay?

23:18.484 --> 23:22.183
Where would you always take me
after my Little League games?

23:22.226 --> 23:23.489
You... you...

23:23.532 --> 23:26.100
you mean Chaz E. Cheddar's
on Route 18?

23:33.107 --> 23:34.151
[Veronica] Reggie!

23:34.935 --> 23:35.805
Oh, crap.

23:37.938 --> 23:38.765
[Veronica sighs]

23:38.808 --> 23:40.506
I want the truth, Reginald.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.116
-Now.
-Okay.

23:42.159 --> 23:45.467
I offered my soul to Mr. Cypher
and he didn't want it.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.904
He said it was
a miserable, paltry thing.

23:47.948 --> 23:48.992
It is.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.168
So, then you
offered mine instead?

23:51.212 --> 23:52.561
He asked for it.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.171
He said yours would be
the real prize.

23:54.215 --> 23:57.261
Oh, my God. So you sold me
down the River Styx?

23:57.305 --> 24:00.917
How did this happen?
I didn't even sign a contract.

24:00.961 --> 24:05.313
You know those, uh,
weekly invoices you sign?

24:05.356 --> 24:06.793
I slipped a contract

24:06.836 --> 24:09.665
in one of those stacks

24:09.709 --> 24:13.800
and gave you Mr. Cypher's pen
to use.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.236
-[shrieks]
-[Reggie gasps]

24:16.498 --> 24:18.935
Ronnie, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.634
I only agreed to it
because I knew
you'd figure a way out.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.158
Get out

24:24.201 --> 24:25.768
of my sight.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.204
You've done enough.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.209
Out! Now!

24:38.694 --> 24:40.174
[electricity crackling]

24:48.051 --> 24:49.009
Mr. Cypher.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.185
-[bell tolls]
-Ms. Lodge.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.491
So, listen.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.625
I might be open
to a renegotiation.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.715
A soul in exchange for yours.

24:59.759 --> 25:03.023
But not another of those
Nick St. Clair types.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.721
What about that

25:05.765 --> 25:08.507
holy roller that's
trying to shut you down?

25:09.377 --> 25:10.552
Alice?

25:10.596 --> 25:12.598
You get me her signature

25:13.381 --> 25:15.514
using my pen,

25:15.557 --> 25:16.819
and I'll release your soul.

25:18.604 --> 25:21.955
Otherwise, you and I
have a date at midnight.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.612
[cell phone ringing]

25:32.226 --> 25:33.836
Hello?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.925
[reporter] Is this
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III?

25:35.969 --> 25:37.753
Yeah.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.276
[chuckling] Hi. David Fenwick
with The Associated Press.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.017
We read your
interview with the devil.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.106
It's incredible.
We'd love to pick it up.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.674
The entire world needs
to read what you wrote.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.633
So, after the AP picked up
my story,

25:47.676 --> 25:50.113
my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.420
-[phone ringing]
-Hang on, let me call you back.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.856
I even got a call from...

25:55.945 --> 25:58.034
-Samm?
-Kid, your article's amazing.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.384
I never should have dropped you
as a client. I apologize.

26:00.428 --> 26:03.866
But will you please
let me be your agent again?

26:03.910 --> 26:05.520
Before you answer, hear me out.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.609
I've been in touch
with the Pulitzer people.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.393
Now, because I'm me,
I gotta ask.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.570
What are you writing next?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.577
Oh. Mr. Hubbard.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.361
Hi.

26:20.404 --> 26:21.667
What can I get you?

26:21.710 --> 26:23.277
I don't have any money.
But I thought,

26:23.320 --> 26:26.106
in exchange for a bowl of soup,
I could wash some dishes.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.240
You do not need
to wash any dishes.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.894
Just have a seat.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.331
I will bring you
a bowl of soup.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.942
Bless you. Thank you

26:38.684 --> 26:40.511
That was very kind of you.

26:40.555 --> 26:41.904
Oh, well,

26:41.948 --> 26:44.907
that's just what we do
here at Pop's. [chuckles]

26:44.951 --> 26:46.648
Yes.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.129
