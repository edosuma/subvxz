WEBVTT

00:01.838 --> 00:02.507
My name's Sebastian,

00:02.573 --> 00:03.771
and I've been following

00:03.806 --> 00:05.004
what's going on with your son.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.272
Don't call me anymore.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.174
What do you like? Give, take?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.742
I just want to make out.

00:15.078 --> 00:17.778
Eric, he is gay. He
tried to kill himself.

00:17.813 --> 00:19.312
Did you ever touch him?

00:19.347 --> 00:21.079
Geez. How could you...?

00:21.115 --> 00:23.013
My head really hurts.
Do you have anything?

00:23.049 --> 00:24.214
I have some oxy.

00:24.249 --> 00:26.281
But don't gulp them
'cause they have a kick.

00:29.953 --> 00:31.718
Is Dr. Graham gonna be back soon?

00:31.754 --> 00:33.952
She's probably still
speaking right about now.

00:35.021 --> 00:36.286
Hey, what are you doing here, huh?

00:36.322 --> 00:37.221
You little bitch.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.749
There was such an incongruency

00:42.784 --> 00:46.751
of being in the school
and hearing gunfire,

00:46.786 --> 00:51.919
just this sound that
violates that space...

00:51.955 --> 00:57.822
that it... it... it just didn't
belong there and made no sense.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.991
The birth of my children
would be very significant,

01:01.025 --> 01:05.693
but that event, you know,
it impacted me as a father,

01:05.728 --> 01:09.895
a husband, a parent, a teacher, um...

01:09.930 --> 01:12.929
uh, a citizen, uh, a-a-a friend.

01:12.965 --> 01:17.932
I-It changed... it... it...
it touched every aspect of my life.

01:17.968 --> 01:21.033
It's very hard to get
people to understand

01:21.069 --> 01:22.434
what mass trauma is like.

01:22.469 --> 01:23.835
If you haven't been through it,

01:23.871 --> 01:26.903
there's really no way to
adequately describe it.

01:26.938 --> 01:29.638
I assumed someone had
done something stupid

01:29.673 --> 01:32.572
and brought a gun and
possibly even shot the gun

01:32.608 --> 01:34.340
but not shot a person.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.941
That is just...

01:36.977 --> 01:39.809
sucking up power wherever you can get it

01:39.844 --> 01:43.711
and maybe even, preferably,
from the least powerful.

01:47.149 --> 01:51.948
And I say all that,
and I still love Dylan.

01:51.984 --> 01:56.785
Tell me about that.
Why do you love Dylan?

01:56.820 --> 02:00.853
'Cause I love all of my students.

02:00.889 --> 02:03.921
All of us have been hurt.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.088
We've...

02:05.123 --> 02:07.156
We've all been wounded,

02:07.191 --> 02:10.991
and all of us, we...
we... we deal in tragedy

02:11.026 --> 02:13.159
I-in our own way.

02:15.896 --> 02:19.629
Two days ago, a former student

02:19.664 --> 02:23.664
came to our school with a gun

02:23.699 --> 02:28.966
and killed Wes Baxter.

02:29.002 --> 02:34.103
Uh, Wes was a... he
was a fellow classmate.

02:34.137 --> 02:36.703
He was a teammate.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.638
He was a friend.

02:38.673 --> 02:40.906
And when we lost him...

02:40.941 --> 02:42.773
we lost a part of ourselves.

02:42.809 --> 02:47.609
And for me, it was like...

02:50.512 --> 02:53.446
Uh, for me, it was like I lost a child.

02:53.481 --> 02:54.546
Uh...

03:00.584 --> 03:04.217
I-I wasn't 100% sure about
re-opening Leyland this soon.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.851
It's really hard to return to a place

03:05.886 --> 03:10.086
where a tragedy happened,
you know, 'cause we want to...

03:10.122 --> 03:11.987
you know, we want to be home,

03:12.023 --> 03:14.689
where we're safe, with family.

03:14.724 --> 03:17.423
And then I thought, you know,
the Leyland community,

03:17.459 --> 03:20.758
we... we are family.

03:20.793 --> 03:24.527
And assembling here this morning,

03:24.562 --> 03:28.296
it's not gonna heal all wounds,
but gathering together,

03:28.331 --> 03:32.597
acknowledging to each other that...

03:32.632 --> 03:36.365
that we have each other to
lean on, it... it helps.

03:39.937 --> 03:42.068
Look, if...

03:42.103 --> 03:45.037
If we don't love each other...

03:45.072 --> 03:49.406
and I mean really love each other...

03:49.441 --> 03:54.441
this... this is what happens.

03:54.477 --> 03:57.043
Uh, it's... it's...

03:57.078 --> 04:00.778
Talking about, you know,
uh, love and responsibility

04:00.813 --> 04:04.246
and doing right, I mean,
that's... that's easy.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.849
This is, uh...

04:09.884 --> 04:13.917
What happened here...

04:13.953 --> 04:20.488
Hate and death and guns in schools...

04:20.523 --> 04:21.964
People say this is the new normal.

04:21.976 --> 04:24.076
Is this the normal we want?

04:28.979 --> 04:32.112
It's up to us.

04:42.228 --> 04:43.454
My name is Sheryl Moore,

04:43.454 --> 04:45.057
and I'm the mother of A.J. Betts.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.785
A.J. made a statement
that was very poignant.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.253
He said, "Mom, I just can't
go to this school anymore

04:51.288 --> 04:53.788
where people are hurting my feelings

04:53.822 --> 04:56.789
and making me cry every
day because I'm gay."

04:56.824 --> 04:58.423
And I said, "A.J., do you want me

04:58.458 --> 04:59.790
to pull you out of that school?

04:59.825 --> 05:01.624
Because I'll do it in a heartbeat.

05:01.659 --> 05:03.159
I'll send you to another school

05:03.194 --> 05:04.960
where you feel more comfortable."

05:04.995 --> 05:07.228
And he said...

05:07.263 --> 05:08.494
"No, Mom.

05:08.530 --> 05:12.096
I'm pretty sure it's not
okay to be gay anywhere."

05:12.131 --> 05:14.231
And I said, "You know what, buddy?

05:14.266 --> 05:16.065
I don't disagree with you."

05:17.167 --> 05:19.533
And he said, "I'm just gonna do my time

05:19.568 --> 05:21.334
and be done with my senior year

05:21.369 --> 05:23.435
and graduate and go on to college

05:23.470 --> 05:25.502
where people are more accepting."

05:25.538 --> 05:29.071
And I said, "I think
that's a great idea, A.J."

05:29.106 --> 05:31.639
And those were the last
words my son said to me

05:31.674 --> 05:35.140
before he took his life.

05:35.176 --> 05:37.041
At the age of 17, I
was already independent

05:37.077 --> 05:40.143
because of the impacts of
bullying on me at like 8 and 9.

05:40.179 --> 05:42.477
And my parents all this
time's wondering, like,

05:42.512 --> 05:44.245
"What's happening in school?
What's happening in school?"

05:44.280 --> 05:45.779
These kids are really this vicious.

05:45.815 --> 05:47.313
You hear these stories on the news.

05:47.349 --> 05:48.847
These kids really are this vicious.

05:48.883 --> 05:50.915
And I thought, "Okay,
if they're gonna be vicious,

05:50.950 --> 05:52.649
then I'm gonna be vicious back."

06:07.359 --> 06:10.691
How are you?

06:10.727 --> 06:14.493
Are you... Are things okay in here?

06:17.063 --> 06:20.363
Taylor, I need to know that you're okay.

06:21.598 --> 06:25.732
They keep me separated. I'm okay.

06:25.767 --> 06:29.033
Can you tell me what happened?

06:33.304 --> 06:37.104
I was told I should confront things.

06:37.139 --> 06:39.272
But, um...

06:39.307 --> 06:40.605
that wasn't really working out.

06:40.641 --> 06:42.173
I was...

06:42.209 --> 06:44.241
I got in this space where
I wanted to hurt myself,

06:44.277 --> 06:46.942
and then I went to this other space.

06:46.977 --> 06:50.077
Why should I be hurting me?
They did this to me.

06:50.113 --> 06:51.411
They did it to you.

06:51.446 --> 06:55.246
That woman did this to you, so...

06:55.282 --> 06:58.047
I...

06:58.082 --> 07:03.317
Um, did you make a list of people
that you wanted to hurt?

07:05.986 --> 07:09.353
Yeah.

07:09.389 --> 07:12.254
And... And... And... And you waited...

07:12.290 --> 07:15.455
for the head of that
school to come back.

07:19.093 --> 07:21.625
I'm meeting with the lawyer,

07:21.661 --> 07:25.260
and we're gonna figure out what to do.

07:25.296 --> 07:28.062
What's there to do?

07:28.097 --> 07:30.563
We'll figure it out.

07:35.734 --> 07:38.668
Taylor, listen.

07:38.702 --> 07:42.136
We'll figure out something.

07:42.171 --> 07:45.003
Okay?

07:49.341 --> 07:51.507
Hey. Curt at work?

07:51.542 --> 07:52.540
Yeah.

07:52.575 --> 07:54.075
Brother here?

07:54.110 --> 07:55.542
He took off.

07:55.577 --> 07:58.376
Want to show you something.

08:06.649 --> 08:09.382
Where'd you get all this money?

08:09.418 --> 08:10.950
I got rid of some things.

08:10.985 --> 08:14.151
I got rid of everything except the car.

08:14.186 --> 08:15.519
What's it for?

08:15.554 --> 08:17.619
It's for us.

08:17.654 --> 08:20.087
I need to get us out of here.

08:20.122 --> 08:23.488
Peter, this family is sick.

08:23.524 --> 08:25.656
Your brother is not well.
Your father is not well.

08:25.692 --> 08:26.791
What's the matter with...

08:26.826 --> 08:29.525
I don't want anything to happen to you.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.859
What's wrong with Dad?

08:30.895 --> 08:33.794
He has got problems. He...

08:33.828 --> 08:36.095
He did things to your brother.

08:36.164 --> 08:39.196
He is the reason that
Eric is the way he is.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.864
Dad wouldn't do something like that.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.365
He's not going to admit it.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.500
He is never going to say anything,
but he is the reason.

08:46.536 --> 08:47.867
Your brother was normal,

08:47.903 --> 08:49.969
and then something happened to him.

08:50.004 --> 08:51.269
Your father happened to him.

08:51.304 --> 08:55.004
I-I can't stay here,
I can't be around all of this,

08:55.039 --> 08:57.305
and I can't leave you with him.

08:58.141 --> 09:00.074
Peter, uh...

09:01.977 --> 09:06.076
You know you don't belong here.

09:06.111 --> 09:09.645
You know you don't belong with them.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.680
And you know if you stay here,

09:13.716 --> 09:15.880
nothing's gonna get better.

09:15.916 --> 09:19.450
Peter, you know it.

09:19.485 --> 09:24.885
That is everything I have left.

09:24.921 --> 09:27.953
I can't do anything for your brother,

09:27.989 --> 09:33.090
so, please, let me get us out of here.

09:34.459 --> 09:36.624
And go where?

09:36.660 --> 09:39.258
Wherever you want.

09:39.294 --> 09:41.660
I heard, like, a loud bang
coming from the parking lot.

09:41.695 --> 09:44.395
It sounded like a fight
breaking out or something.

09:44.430 --> 09:45.795
Then kids were, like, running,

09:45.831 --> 09:47.463
like, sprinting past the window,

09:47.498 --> 09:49.130
screaming after the gunshot.

09:49.165 --> 09:51.932
Then I saw people running,
and I said to the teacher,

09:51.967 --> 09:54.133
"We need to get out of here right now."

09:54.168 --> 09:56.700
This has been a complicated
case for some time now,

09:56.736 --> 09:58.935
with reports that the
shooter was bullied at school.

09:58.970 --> 10:00.902
Daddy, the bus.

10:00.938 --> 10:03.604
Or will the judge just
see this as another case

10:03.639 --> 10:05.638
- of an unstable gunman?
- You know what?

10:05.674 --> 10:09.040
- We're gonna take a little trip.
- The answers to those questions remain unclear.

10:21.382 --> 10:23.180
Hello.

10:23.216 --> 10:24.681
Hey. You all right?

10:24.716 --> 10:26.281
Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay.

10:26.317 --> 10:28.116
Well, I-I-I've been calling.

10:28.151 --> 10:29.350
Y-You didn't pick up.

10:29.386 --> 10:31.051
I... I, uh...

10:31.953 --> 10:34.586
I didn't feel like talking.

10:35.855 --> 10:38.254
You still want me to
come out there, right?

10:39.456 --> 10:41.522
I very...

10:41.557 --> 10:44.891
very much want you to come out here.

10:44.926 --> 10:45.991
Good, good.

10:46.027 --> 10:48.092
Look, I'm boarding from
New York right now.

10:48.128 --> 10:50.394
I'll take a direct flight to Indy.

10:51.462 --> 10:53.461
Just...

10:53.497 --> 10:56.296
breathe.

10:56.332 --> 10:58.197
I'm going into work.

10:58.233 --> 10:59.331
No, n-no.

10:59.366 --> 11:01.332
- Mm, yeah.
- Don't... Don't do that.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.600
Sitting here, it's not doing anything.

11:03.635 --> 11:05.134
I'm on my way.

11:05.169 --> 11:07.335
- I'm on my way.
- I know, but I need to work.

11:07.370 --> 11:08.502
I really do.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.936
I know I sound upset,
but I'm really not.

11:10.972 --> 11:13.671
I'm... I'm... I need to... I'll
see you when you get here, okay?

11:13.707 --> 11:15.139
No, no, Leslie...

11:15.174 --> 11:17.874
I promise, promise.

11:40.401 --> 11:43.225
I didn't know if I could
ever love a student again.

11:43.225 --> 11:45.658
I didn't know if I could
ever bond that way again,

11:45.693 --> 11:48.538
and... and it's always been a
strength of mine as a teacher,

11:48.538 --> 11:50.227
the fact that I do bond tightly to kids

11:50.234 --> 11:51.899
and that I do genuinely love them.

11:53.202 --> 11:56.768
Um, I was rather shocked
when I went back that I could...

11:56.803 --> 11:58.869
I could still do it.

11:58.904 --> 12:00.670
But I can never again guarantee

12:00.705 --> 12:04.638
that one of those kids that
I love won't ever shoot me.

12:08.243 --> 12:10.042
Grace.

12:10.077 --> 12:14.010
I think, first thing,
has anyone made any decisions

12:14.046 --> 12:15.678
with regard to final exams?

12:15.713 --> 12:16.878
I don't think so.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.278
Let's get the deans together.

12:18.314 --> 12:19.980
Let's cancel finals... one less thing

12:20.014 --> 12:21.980
for the students to
worry about... and, uh...

12:22.015 --> 12:23.914
seniors who have been
accepted to colleges...

12:23.950 --> 12:26.149
find out where, get in touch,
let those schools know

12:26.184 --> 12:27.417
they'll have incoming students

12:27.452 --> 12:31.619
who may have varying degrees of trauma.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.086
What?

12:34.121 --> 12:37.121
It's... W-We didn't
expect you back so soon.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.122
Everyone else is.

12:46.228 --> 12:48.627
How long was he out there?

12:48.662 --> 12:52.662
How long did he sit
there, waiting for me?

12:52.698 --> 12:55.129
A little over an hour.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.132
Thank you, Grace.

13:01.168 --> 13:03.167
Get back to me on the finals.

13:03.202 --> 13:04.535
Okay.

13:48.558 --> 13:50.790
It was odd not to see Leslie there.

13:50.826 --> 13:52.591
How do you think she's handled...

13:52.627 --> 13:55.259
I'm sorry. You know, Wes
hasn't even been buried yet.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.593
I'm not... I'm not in the headspace

13:56.629 --> 13:59.261
to be talking about that.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.961
I would really like
to know your opinion.

14:00.997 --> 14:02.162
Look, you want to know what I think?

14:02.198 --> 14:03.396
I think she's... it up.

14:03.431 --> 14:05.297
From the start, all she's
done is make choices

14:05.332 --> 14:07.131
that have hurt my players,
hurt this school.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.965
Oh, and then... and then
she did everything she can

14:09.001 --> 14:11.267
to protect herself and make
sure her ass was covered,

14:11.302 --> 14:13.368
and the one time... the
one time that the school

14:13.403 --> 14:15.269
really needs her...
needs her... needs her

14:15.337 --> 14:17.169
to stand front and center
and be a leader...

14:17.205 --> 14:20.005
nothing.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.272
You know, if there's a donor
who's got money,

14:22.307 --> 14:24.606
she's right there.

14:25.843 --> 14:28.275
She can't even cry in public.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.677
Eric...

14:31.712 --> 14:33.844
my player...

14:34.980 --> 14:36.746
He never touched that kid.

14:36.781 --> 14:38.346
He never forced himself on him,

14:38.382 --> 14:40.981
and then that kid comes
back and kills Wes?

14:41.017 --> 14:43.516
Yeah.

14:43.550 --> 14:48.218
Leslie should've settled
this thing a long time ago.

14:48.253 --> 14:52.387
There are a lot of us who think
there need to be changes.

14:52.422 --> 14:55.221
But the school board is split on Leslie,

14:55.256 --> 14:59.057
and she's got a lot of
donors who like her.

14:59.091 --> 15:02.558
A lot of people don't.

15:04.261 --> 15:06.826
The county prosecutor
wants to try Taylor as an adult,

15:06.862 --> 15:07.928
not as a juvenile offender.

15:07.963 --> 15:09.094
He's a child!

15:09.130 --> 15:10.162
He made a mistake!

15:10.197 --> 15:11.696
He had a gun, he lay in wait,

15:11.731 --> 15:13.530
he was under the influence of drugs,

15:13.565 --> 15:14.830
and he shot another student.

15:14.866 --> 15:16.332
Well, what happened before that?

15:16.367 --> 15:18.099
I mean, if somebody...

15:18.135 --> 15:19.300
if... if they attacked him,

15:19.335 --> 15:21.301
doesn't he have a right
to stand his ground?

15:21.336 --> 15:22.868
I mean, it's a self-defense!

15:22.903 --> 15:25.069
With a stolen gun on school property?

15:29.740 --> 15:31.506
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

15:31.541 --> 15:34.006
Tell me how I'm supposed
to fight this, please.

15:34.042 --> 15:36.541
My advice... reach a plea deal
with the county prosecutor.

15:36.576 --> 15:39.276
Oh, no, I'm not letting
Taylor plead to anything.

15:39.312 --> 15:40.076
Anne...

15:40.111 --> 15:40.910
No.

15:40.946 --> 15:42.611
T-T-T-T-That...

15:42.646 --> 15:45.346
kid who raped my son...
he didn't plead to anything!

15:45.381 --> 15:47.314
That kid... he didn't...
they didn't even arrest him!

15:47.349 --> 15:49.714
The police have Taylor's e-mails.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.849
They know he was attracted
to violent behavior.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.051
This state has sentenced a
12-year-old to a 25-year term

15:56.086 --> 15:57.818
on a lesser offense.

15:57.853 --> 15:59.552
And there are a lot of
people in this state

15:59.587 --> 16:01.653
that have some backward views on gays.

16:01.689 --> 16:02.888
You don't want them deciding

16:02.923 --> 16:05.055
how many years your son is
going to spend in prison.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.656
If Taylor pleads, he'll avoid a trial,

16:07.692 --> 16:09.357
and he'll likely get a lesser sentence.

16:09.392 --> 16:11.591
I can't do that. I can't

16:11.627 --> 16:13.492
Can't do that to him.

16:15.295 --> 16:17.995
If you want to help your son,
you're gonna have to find a way

16:18.030 --> 16:22.830
to change the narrative,
or let me work on a plea deal.

16:25.233 --> 16:28.000
Parental
kidnapping is a reportable crime

16:28.035 --> 16:30.201
only if there is a valid
custody order in place.

16:30.236 --> 16:31.868
My wife and I have shared custody.

16:31.904 --> 16:33.736
So there is a custodial order in place?

16:33.771 --> 16:35.437
Alternating weeks. This isn't her week.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.204
It's custodial
interference. You can't...

16:37.239 --> 16:38.871
I don't care what you want to call it.

16:38.907 --> 16:40.605
I want to file a missing-persons report

16:40.641 --> 16:42.873
- on my son.
- You can't file a missing-persons report

16:42.909 --> 16:44.007
for custodial interference.

16:44.042 --> 16:45.642
Look, I don't know where he is!

16:45.677 --> 16:47.643
That makes him missing, right?!

16:47.678 --> 16:49.710
I don't even know if
he's with his mother.

16:49.745 --> 16:51.877
Uh, so, to the best of your knowledge,

16:51.913 --> 16:54.846
it's not parental kidnapping
or custodial interference?

17:03.889 --> 17:06.521
I was accused of sexual
assault when I was 15.

17:06.607 --> 17:10.439
It happened after I came out
to my Catholic high school.

17:10.508 --> 17:13.106
The next day, my... my mom,
my grandmother, and my aunt

17:13.142 --> 17:16.008
came up to the school to have a
meeting about why they were...

17:16.042 --> 17:18.809
why they were trying to charge
me with this, and there was,

17:18.844 --> 17:20.843
you know, three black women in the room,

17:20.878 --> 17:22.078
um, not including myself,

17:22.113 --> 17:24.311
and these all-white administrators.

17:24.348 --> 17:27.981
You know, I just came out,
but I still was the same

17:28.016 --> 17:31.115
scholar/athlete that they
named me the year prior.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.449
I felt betrayed.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.317
Um, I felt that the original sin
that they were teaching ab...

17:35.353 --> 17:37.786
teaching me about in
religion class that day,

17:37.821 --> 17:39.653
the... the administrators looked at me

17:39.688 --> 17:41.320
as that original sin.

17:41.356 --> 17:43.822
Just days after the fatal shooting

17:43.857 --> 17:45.423
of 17-year-old Wes Baxter,

17:45.458 --> 17:46.956
private security officers were on hand

17:46.992 --> 17:49.557
as students arrived to attend
an early-morning prayer service

17:49.634 --> 17:50.932
to remember their classmate.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.859
Your mother say anything
to you about taking Peter?

17:52.895 --> 17:55.061
- The Leyland school's administrators say counselors
- She's not gonna talk to me.

17:55.096 --> 17:57.628
- Will be available as long as they're needed...
- She's not gonna tell me anything.

17:57.663 --> 17:58.429
And they promise to keep the school

17:58.484 --> 18:00.182
the safest it's ever been.

18:00.218 --> 18:02.750
- Not a lot is known yet about the gunman.
- What happened to your face?

18:02.786 --> 18:04.985
- Indianapolis police have, however...
- I'm not stupid.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.686
Confirmed that the
former Leyland student

18:06.721 --> 18:08.753
is cooperating fully with the
the ongoing investigation.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.088
I've seen those...

18:13.123 --> 18:16.557
those sites or wherever it is you go on.

18:16.593 --> 18:18.492
How come you never said anything?

18:18.527 --> 18:21.526
I didn't know what to say.

18:21.561 --> 18:23.494
Why do you do it?

18:23.529 --> 18:25.061
Why?

18:25.096 --> 18:26.862
And a pivotal member of
the championship-winning

18:26.897 --> 18:28.163
Leyland Knights basketball team...

18:28.198 --> 18:31.331
I don't have to be who
other people think.

18:31.366 --> 18:34.465
You got to stop.

18:34.501 --> 18:37.767
I don't owe anybody.
I don't have to please anybody.

18:39.237 --> 18:42.703
People you meet on a phone?!

18:42.738 --> 18:44.237
You act like that thing is a toy!

18:44.272 --> 18:45.271
It's a weapon!

18:45.306 --> 18:47.606
You got to stop doing this to yourself!

18:47.641 --> 18:49.406
You feel sorry for yourself,

18:49.442 --> 18:52.741
but you don't take responsibility!

18:56.144 --> 18:57.377
So...

18:57.412 --> 19:01.112
I've got one son who's missing,
and the police don't care.

19:02.248 --> 19:04.380
Uh, and you...

19:06.884 --> 19:09.883
You're trying to kill yourself
every way you know how.

19:12.086 --> 19:14.619
And I can't do anything.

19:17.121 --> 19:21.989
I can't do a thing if you won't let me.

19:28.394 --> 19:31.193
But if you want something else,

19:31.228 --> 19:32.860
I'm here.

19:32.896 --> 19:34.828
Same as always.

19:37.665 --> 19:39.464
I'm here.

19:43.868 --> 19:49.536
My experiences of
homophobia, racism, sexism,

19:49.571 --> 19:53.671
they all subconsciously met up
with me at 20 in the bathroom,

19:53.706 --> 19:56.505
right before I was about to...

19:56.541 --> 19:58.072
hang myself.

19:58.108 --> 20:01.275
It was... It was a cry for help.

20:01.310 --> 20:04.376
And I-I realized that I
didn't want to be reduced

20:04.411 --> 20:05.576
to that moment,

20:05.611 --> 20:09.279
be reduced to the girl
who committed suicide.

20:18.952 --> 20:21.717
Um, I'm gonna go out for a minute.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.685
Okay.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.554
Has, um, Kevin said anything to you...

20:26.589 --> 20:29.021
anything about how he's feeling?

20:29.056 --> 20:32.089
No, but he gave me a hug.

20:32.125 --> 20:35.324
Maybe the first one he's
given me since he was 13.

20:37.961 --> 20:40.793
How you doing?

20:40.828 --> 20:42.194
You know something?

20:42.230 --> 20:44.528
I feel vindicated.

20:44.564 --> 20:45.596
Yeah.

20:45.631 --> 20:47.363
Michael, don't say that.

20:47.399 --> 20:48.564
I do.

20:48.599 --> 20:50.631
I mean, this woman that's
been going after our boy,

20:50.667 --> 20:52.299
she turns out to be crazy.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.633
The kid is crazy.

20:54.669 --> 20:57.168
Now he's a murderer.

20:57.203 --> 20:59.536
Yeah, I'm being honest with you.
I feel vindicated.

21:01.306 --> 21:04.038
I'll be back.

21:04.073 --> 21:06.506
All right.

21:09.276 --> 21:11.841
All right, come on.

21:11.877 --> 21:14.944
Come on. Come on. Get
your stuff. Let's go.

21:16.279 --> 21:18.045
Where are we going?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.445
Indianapolis.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.613
Is it nice?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.681
Not as nice as Milwaukee.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.716
But it's nice.

21:26.751 --> 21:29.951
What are we gonna do there?

21:29.986 --> 21:32.185
Your daddy's gonna help somebody.

21:33.754 --> 21:35.920
They want my resignation?

21:37.456 --> 21:38.854
There's a movement, yes.

21:40.791 --> 21:42.723
Why?

21:42.758 --> 21:44.091
It's not a done deal.

21:44.126 --> 21:46.959
The board hasn't brought
it to a vote, but...

21:46.994 --> 21:48.559
there's...

21:48.595 --> 21:50.127
I'm just here to tell
you which way the...

21:50.163 --> 21:52.228
Why are they doing this to me?

21:52.264 --> 21:54.963
I've done everything to
protect this school, to...

21:54.998 --> 21:57.864
to manage this crisis.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.032
When a tragedy like this happens,

22:00.067 --> 22:01.800
of course there's gonna be a transition.

22:01.835 --> 22:03.500
Yeah, it's not a transition.

22:03.536 --> 22:05.602
They're looking to shift blame, to...

22:05.637 --> 22:11.171
to take attention away from the fact...

22:11.206 --> 22:12.738
They want to lay their... on me,

22:12.773 --> 22:16.239
and I'm supposed to carry
it out of here when I go.

22:16.275 --> 22:17.773
There's a lot of money at stake...

22:17.809 --> 22:20.041
tens of millions locked in our C.E.P.

22:20.110 --> 22:21.775
Money I brought in.

22:21.811 --> 22:25.277
I need to speak to Rhys Bashir.
He won't put up with this.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.847
If th...

22:34.784 --> 22:37.083
If they want to make a statement,

22:37.118 --> 22:39.351
the board should dissolve itself.

22:39.386 --> 22:42.219
That's how you make a clean start.

22:42.254 --> 22:45.887
You know that's not going to happen.

22:45.923 --> 22:47.421
There's a lot of emotion around,

22:47.457 --> 22:51.523
and people are making
Dan the face of all this.

22:51.559 --> 22:52.890
Dan Sullivan?

23:01.163 --> 23:03.096
Dan?

23:08.533 --> 23:10.733
Please?

23:15.137 --> 23:19.137
I've been told people have
been talking to you about...

23:19.172 --> 23:20.971
about...

23:21.007 --> 23:24.039
possibly taking a position that isn't...

23:24.074 --> 23:26.674
About telling the truth?

23:28.243 --> 23:29.808
What do you think the truth is?

23:29.844 --> 23:31.542
What do you think I've been doing?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.677
Manipulating people.

23:33.712 --> 23:34.511
No.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.145
Protecting yourself.

23:36.180 --> 23:39.046
I've been protecting this school.

23:39.081 --> 23:41.814
This school, what I do, how I do it...

23:41.850 --> 23:43.148
they matter to me.

23:43.183 --> 23:46.317
These kids... they're just
names on a ledger to you.

23:46.352 --> 23:47.651
Just a way to raise money.

23:47.686 --> 23:49.318
You sit in your office talking about

23:49.353 --> 23:51.019
how you'd drown one to save the other.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.086
I said nothing like that.

23:53.122 --> 23:55.921
I-If... If I used metaphor
t-to make a point...

23:55.957 --> 24:00.690
You... You talk about my team
with no emotion... none.

24:00.725 --> 24:02.591
I'm down here with these kids every day.

24:02.626 --> 24:05.326
- And you don't think...
- I see them in a way that you can't.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.093
That doesn't give you an agenda?

24:07.129 --> 24:10.094
Can you even consider that I am
objective in ways you aren't?

24:10.130 --> 24:12.796
My boys were accused,

24:12.831 --> 24:14.730
tried to kill themselves, got murdered.

24:14.766 --> 24:17.132
I'm not trying to be objective.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.766
And you tried to handle this
like it was a-a math problem.

24:19.801 --> 24:21.757
I did as necessary

24:21.757 --> 24:23.286
- to preserve this institution.
- No, you did it...

24:23.286 --> 24:25.935
- And you act like that's wrong.
- No, you did it no matter who got hurt.

24:25.971 --> 24:27.803
What would you have done?

24:30.507 --> 24:33.106
Y-You see all this? Huh?

24:33.142 --> 24:36.007
I mean, I know it's just bull...
basketball to you.

24:36.043 --> 24:39.275
But you... you earn all
of this with values...

24:39.310 --> 24:43.611
- values that we put into play every single day.
- That is so...

24:43.646 --> 24:45.412
And if we had stuck to them,

24:45.447 --> 24:47.780
if we had stuck with each other,

24:47.815 --> 24:50.248
we could've gotten through this.

24:50.283 --> 24:52.782
Principles don't cut it, not
when no one else has them.

24:52.817 --> 24:54.816
A boy accused a boy of rape.

24:54.851 --> 24:58.285
You think anyone really
wanted to deal with that?

24:58.320 --> 24:59.652
Did you?

24:59.688 --> 25:02.453
They wanted to bury and hide and deny,

25:02.488 --> 25:03.788
and I was left to deal with it,

25:03.823 --> 25:08.057
and I did what I thought
was... was judicious

25:08.092 --> 25:09.957
and sensible under the circumstances

25:09.993 --> 25:11.958
because that's what a politician does.

25:11.994 --> 25:14.292
That's what I was brought here to do,

25:14.327 --> 25:19.295
and now people are trying
to blame me for it?

25:22.932 --> 25:25.831
I'm scared. I'm...

25:25.866 --> 25:26.899
I'm really scared.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.032
I have spent my whole life

25:28.068 --> 25:30.901
trying to put things in
order, but I can't...

25:30.936 --> 25:32.768
I can't manage this situation.

25:32.804 --> 25:35.270
I don't even understand it.

25:37.639 --> 25:40.706
People are asking you

25:40.741 --> 25:43.907
for one time

25:43.942 --> 25:46.842
to take responsibility.

25:46.877 --> 25:48.676
Yeah, I mean,

25:48.712 --> 25:53.344
everybody else  got hurt by this.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.913
Everybody but you.

25:58.916 --> 26:00.715
And you wonder why Taylor stole a gun

26:00.750 --> 26:03.083
and came here looking for you?

26:22.051 --> 26:24.016
The healing is very individual,

26:24.212 --> 26:27.345
and for... for many,
I think it's... for some,

26:27.415 --> 26:29.380
it... it has to even be a decision.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.181
And that it doesn't...

26:31.216 --> 26:35.783
I-It could take years
before there is something

26:35.818 --> 26:39.052
that feels like it might be healing.

26:45.589 --> 26:47.455
Thanks for coming.

26:47.490 --> 26:48.556
How are you?

26:48.591 --> 26:49.923
All right.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.124
Yeah, you're okay?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.626
Since you fired me?

26:54.661 --> 26:55.826
Not really.

26:55.861 --> 26:57.427
I haven't been able to
find another position,

26:57.462 --> 27:01.429
and I'm starting to tap into my savings.

27:01.464 --> 27:03.730
The reason I wanted to sit down with you

27:03.765 --> 27:06.931
is because I think there are
things that need to be said,

27:06.966 --> 27:10.167
things that... should be said...

27:10.202 --> 27:12.734
things I need you to understand.

27:14.104 --> 27:17.503
I didn't handle your situation well.

27:17.539 --> 27:19.237
You didn't handle it at all.

27:19.273 --> 27:21.739
You let me go for no reason.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.006
You weren't a strong employee.

27:24.041 --> 27:27.041
You had problems, and
you couldn't execute.

27:28.043 --> 27:30.276
Is that your version of "I'm sorry"?

27:30.311 --> 27:33.944
Debra, you weren't strong, but...

27:33.979 --> 27:36.712
I didn't do anything
to help you understand

27:36.748 --> 27:40.714
how you could be better
or how you were failing.

27:40.750 --> 27:45.983
I couldn't accept that anybody,
especially a woman of color...

27:46.019 --> 27:47.251
What difference does that make?

27:49.320 --> 27:54.388
I couldn't accept the
failure in you because I...

27:54.423 --> 27:56.289
couldn't...

27:56.324 --> 27:58.023
see the failure in myself.

28:00.493 --> 28:04.959
And I've been shown a lot
of things lately that...

28:07.830 --> 28:10.329
I'm no better.

28:11.498 --> 28:14.664
So, we're here why?

28:14.699 --> 28:16.165
I saw the news.

28:16.201 --> 28:18.999
Your school, the shooting.

28:19.035 --> 28:20.567
You found Jesus, and
now you got to start

28:20.602 --> 28:22.968
your good works with me?

28:23.003 --> 28:26.870
My son's name was on a list.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.638
A week ago, someone wanted him dead.

28:30.674 --> 28:32.773
I went to a wake

28:32.808 --> 28:37.741
with people I know standing
over their son in a casket.

28:37.777 --> 28:41.244
And my son was supposed
to be next to him.

28:41.279 --> 28:43.278
My child.

28:43.314 --> 28:46.012
My life.

28:52.384 --> 28:57.651
That reality gets put in front of you,

28:57.687 --> 28:59.786
and you find something.

29:01.055 --> 29:02.387
It's a formality. That's all.

29:02.423 --> 29:03.521
Don't bull... me.

29:03.556 --> 29:04.988
The school board is
getting jawed to death

29:05.023 --> 29:05.889
on the student protests.

29:05.924 --> 29:07.790
They're politicians.

29:07.825 --> 29:09.290
They have to look like
they're doing something.

29:09.326 --> 29:10.724
They'll sit you down
and give you a review.

29:10.759 --> 29:12.192
You know it's not gonna end there.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.659
Three boys beat one boy,

29:13.695 --> 29:16.228
and they beat him because he's black.

29:16.263 --> 29:18.262
People can stand outside
the school and chant,

29:18.297 --> 29:20.296
but when it comes time
to talk about this,

29:20.332 --> 29:22.197
they're not gonna have a thing to say.

29:22.233 --> 29:23.364
They're gonna try, but they're gonna

29:23.399 --> 29:24.631
make themselves look
ugly in the process.

29:24.666 --> 29:25.999
- When we get through all this...
- We will.

29:26.034 --> 29:28.633
I expect to get some help on our budget.

29:28.668 --> 29:30.300
I can't give preferential treatment.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.502
Oh, no?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.136
To hell with that!

29:33.171 --> 29:34.703
I stood with you, okay?

29:34.738 --> 29:36.871
I backed you on HHFK.

29:36.906 --> 29:39.572
Marshall goes to the top of your pile.

29:39.608 --> 29:43.274
I'm not asking for cash in a bag for me.

29:43.309 --> 29:45.375
You're going to do
things for this school.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.476
I promise we'd talk
about this, we will...

29:47.512 --> 29:50.677
aboveboard and by the book.

30:11.256 --> 30:12.921
Get back in the car.

30:43.539 --> 30:46.304
Did you mean what you said?

30:47.207 --> 30:49.072
This morning.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.573
Did you mean it?

30:50.608 --> 30:53.408
At the assembly?

30:53.443 --> 30:55.942
No, this doesn't have to be normal.

30:55.977 --> 30:57.310
This doesn't have to be the way it's...

30:57.345 --> 31:00.978
About someone being responsible.

31:01.014 --> 31:03.679
Well, somebody is responsible.

31:05.215 --> 31:07.081
That kid who murdered Wes is going to...

31:07.116 --> 31:09.782
I sold him drugs.

31:13.352 --> 31:17.486
I sold Taylor drugs before he shot Wes.

31:24.125 --> 31:27.090
He texted me.

31:27.126 --> 31:31.226
And he was messed up,
and he wanted drugs.

31:31.261 --> 31:32.493
What drugs? Where did you get drugs?

31:32.528 --> 31:33.894
Mom's.

31:33.930 --> 31:37.062
Mom's, and I got some
from some other kids.

31:37.865 --> 31:40.163
You deal drugs?

31:40.199 --> 31:41.965
You told me that if I ever had a problem

31:42.000 --> 31:44.299
that I could come to you
and you would fix it.

31:44.334 --> 31:45.433
Who knows about this?

31:45.468 --> 31:47.067
- Nobody.
- Well, Taylor knows!

31:47.102 --> 31:48.701
Nobody else.

31:48.736 --> 31:50.435
Those... T-T-These
kids... T-T-These kids,

31:50.470 --> 31:52.203
the ones that you were
getting drugs from,

31:52.238 --> 31:53.703
the ones that you were selling to?!

31:53.738 --> 31:54.804
It's just a few people.

31:54.839 --> 31:56.405
Who?!

31:56.440 --> 31:57.538
Sophie...

31:57.574 --> 31:59.839
Oh... Tommy...

31:59.875 --> 32:01.907
Give me your phone.

32:01.943 --> 32:04.175
Give it to me!

32:15.749 --> 32:17.048
You need to think.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.516
You need to think.

32:18.551 --> 32:21.951
Nobody but you and Taylor
know what happened that day?

32:21.986 --> 32:23.618
Nobody?

32:23.653 --> 32:24.619
Say something!

32:24.654 --> 32:26.919
Nobody knows.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.521
All right.

32:32.757 --> 32:36.824
You don't say anything to anybody.

32:36.859 --> 32:38.025
You understand?

32:38.061 --> 32:38.858
Mm-hmm.

33:19.859 --> 33:21.024
Hey.

33:24.106 --> 33:25.305
Are you... you good?

33:26.428 --> 33:28.560
Becca was selling drugs.

33:28.596 --> 33:30.361
And she sold them to the...

33:30.430 --> 33:33.295
the kid who shot Wes.

33:33.331 --> 33:35.563
W-What... What are you talking about?

33:35.599 --> 33:38.831
Becca sold drugs to the shooter.

33:38.867 --> 33:40.465
Where did she get drugs?

33:40.501 --> 33:41.800
Where do you think?

33:44.436 --> 33:46.102
I already got rid of them.

33:46.138 --> 33:47.436
I got rid of them, and
I got rid of the card

33:47.471 --> 33:48.569
that's... that's in her phone.

33:48.605 --> 33:49.971
Why? Why? Why would
you get rid of the...

33:50.006 --> 33:51.138
Well, she was... she was texting.

33:51.173 --> 33:53.405
The card... the p-p-phone company

33:53.441 --> 33:55.273
has everybody texts.

33:55.308 --> 33:56.840
Y-You... You just made her look guilty.

33:56.876 --> 33:58.274
She is guilty.

33:58.309 --> 34:00.575
She was selling drugs!

34:01.711 --> 34:03.910
Okay.

34:03.945 --> 34:06.145
All right, it was...
it was... it was pot.

34:06.180 --> 34:07.545
Look, do you think the police care?

34:07.580 --> 34:10.514
It's not legal.

34:14.083 --> 34:17.350
Okay, all right, um...

34:17.385 --> 34:19.085
Okay, what do we do?
Who... Who do we call?

34:19.120 --> 34:21.552
We're... no, we're not calling anybody.

34:21.587 --> 34:23.686
Now, look, look, we...
I-I talked to Becca.

34:23.722 --> 34:27.522
She said that Taylor is
the only one who knows.

34:27.556 --> 34:31.157
We can't hide this.

34:31.192 --> 34:32.558
We cannot hide this.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.125
If Taylor was gonna say something...

34:35.161 --> 34:36.493
No, he still could.

34:36.529 --> 34:37.326
And t... And then what?

34:37.362 --> 34:38.427
We throw Becca into this,

34:38.463 --> 34:39.828
what do you think
they're gonna do to her?

34:39.862 --> 34:41.462
What do you think they'll do to us, huh?

34:41.496 --> 34:42.762
I mean, we are in a bad place.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.963
H-How are we in a bad place?

34:43.998 --> 34:45.264
Look, I-I have been out there,

34:45.299 --> 34:46.531
talking down this kid, Taylor.

34:46.565 --> 34:47.998
I have taken positions at the school...

34:48.034 --> 34:49.833
Y-You are talking about you.

34:49.868 --> 34:52.967
Your drugs, our daughter... this is us.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.002
It's about us.

34:55.036 --> 34:56.536
Now, everyone else,
they've done whatever

34:56.571 --> 34:57.969
to protect their kids, their families.

34:58.005 --> 34:59.271
You think I'm gonna do anything better?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.304
I've thought about this.

35:00.339 --> 35:01.305
For how long?

35:01.340 --> 35:03.439
- I sat up there...
- Oh, my God.

35:03.475 --> 35:06.007
Listening to our daughter sobbing.

35:06.042 --> 35:08.475
I stood over a toilet, Steph,

35:08.510 --> 35:12.110
making sure that your drugs,
your crap was gone.

35:12.145 --> 35:13.710
And if it turns out that... that... that

35:13.746 --> 35:15.212
we didn't say anything, that's on us.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.412
It's on us. It's not on her.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.580
Our job is not to tell
the police things.

35:18.615 --> 35:21.614
It's to protect our girl!

35:22.951 --> 35:24.583
Now, look, you... you were
right about the school.

35:24.618 --> 35:25.483
You were right about Leslie.

35:25.518 --> 35:27.184
D... D-Don't make this about her.

35:27.219 --> 35:29.485
No, I-I-I've got a chance
to make things better!

35:29.520 --> 35:32.587
Okay, you keep saying "I"!

35:34.323 --> 35:36.522
We're not turning Becca in.

36:13.609 --> 36:16.208
Yo, you text me for this?

36:16.243 --> 36:19.376
I'm not in the mood to
shoot around, so what's up?

36:20.612 --> 36:21.777
Hey?

36:21.812 --> 36:24.011
I know what you did.

36:24.047 --> 36:25.312
What'd I do?

36:25.347 --> 36:29.847
Sent Wes, LeSean, and them
to give Taylor a beat down.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.481
Wait, what?

36:31.517 --> 36:33.382
Wes, LeSean...

36:33.418 --> 36:35.483
some of the other guys from the team,

36:35.519 --> 36:37.251
they show up at my place
after the last game,

36:37.286 --> 36:38.851
told me how you were
going off on Taylor,

36:38.887 --> 36:40.453
how you were saying
he needed a beat down.

36:40.488 --> 36:43.187
No, I never said that.

36:43.223 --> 36:46.855
They made me call him, tell him
to meet me at the rec center.

36:46.891 --> 36:49.157
They beat him.

36:49.192 --> 36:51.558
That's why he came back with the gun.

36:51.594 --> 36:54.093
Look, I never told them to do anything.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.061
Those are your boys. They do as you say.

36:57.096 --> 36:58.428
Now Wes is dead.

36:58.463 --> 37:02.097
Look, if they're acting out,
that has nothing to do with me.

37:02.131 --> 37:04.631
All right? Nothing.

37:05.467 --> 37:08.833
Something happens, and you never
got anything to do with it!

37:11.203 --> 37:13.603
First time the police came...

37:13.638 --> 37:15.769
after the Captains' party,
I could've told them

37:15.805 --> 37:17.937
about all the liquor you
bought, all the drugs,

37:17.973 --> 37:20.539
all the girls you got to come
around and get screwed.

37:20.574 --> 37:22.106
I didn't. Nobody did.

37:22.141 --> 37:23.840
Nobody ever says
anything bad about Kevin.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.474
You go in there. You got your lawyer.

37:25.509 --> 37:28.176
You read your statement.
You left all this on me!

37:28.211 --> 37:29.643
You and me, we were
supposed to be tight!

37:29.678 --> 37:30.777
"Tight"?!

37:30.813 --> 37:33.211
We were supposed to be tight?!

37:33.247 --> 37:34.813
You couldn't even tell
me you were gay, man.

37:34.848 --> 37:36.080
What are you talking about?!

37:36.115 --> 37:37.847
My dad begs you for help,
and you just send him walking!

37:37.882 --> 37:39.548
That was my parents.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.148
You're the Captain!

37:41.184 --> 37:43.250
You lead!

37:43.285 --> 37:44.251
But you always work it

37:44.286 --> 37:45.951
so you never have to take the blame.

37:45.987 --> 37:48.319
Now Wes is dead.

37:51.055 --> 37:53.255
Hey.

37:53.290 --> 37:54.322
Hey!

37:54.358 --> 37:56.257
Hey!

37:58.492 --> 38:00.158
Who are you telling about this, man?

38:02.095 --> 38:04.160
I'm telling you.

38:14.066 --> 38:17.000
I'm upset with the teachers
and the administration,

38:17.035 --> 38:19.268
and I'm upset with the politicians

38:19.303 --> 38:20.968
that are defending this school.

38:21.004 --> 38:24.637
But I'm doing everything
I can to try and expose it

38:24.672 --> 38:26.638
because I feel like A.J. needs a voice,

38:26.673 --> 38:29.239
and I'm all he has left.

38:42.914 --> 38:43.812
Hello?

38:43.848 --> 38:46.281
Ms. Blaine, this is Sebastian.

38:46.316 --> 38:47.481
I'm in Indiana.

38:47.516 --> 38:49.615
I would really like for us to talk.

38:49.651 --> 38:53.150
See, it started with pictures
getting posted online.

38:53.185 --> 38:55.451
Then it was texts and e-mails he sent,

38:55.487 --> 38:58.153
then somebody putting
your medical records up.

38:58.188 --> 38:59.720
That wasn't for nothing.

38:59.756 --> 39:03.422
Whoever put your records up,
they were trying to attack you.

39:03.457 --> 39:05.657
You see, the social space, it's...

39:05.692 --> 39:07.724
it's not physical.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.592
So people think they can
do whatever they want,

39:09.627 --> 39:10.892
but that's not how it is.

39:10.927 --> 39:12.926
It's just like the physical world,

39:12.962 --> 39:14.794
and if you do something online,

39:14.829 --> 39:16.995
there's got to be consequences.

39:17.031 --> 39:18.329
See, people like me...

39:19.299 --> 39:20.997
See, the system can't do anything.

39:21.033 --> 39:23.132
The police, prosecutors,
they can't do nothing

39:23.167 --> 39:24.866
about crack dealers up the street.

39:24.901 --> 39:26.400
How are they gonna do anything about

39:26.435 --> 39:29.035
what they can't even touch?

39:29.070 --> 39:31.469
I'm just an activist, Ms. Blaine.

39:31.504 --> 39:34.003
20 years ago, I would've been
standing on a street corner,

39:34.039 --> 39:36.204
holding up a sign to support you.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.439
Same thing, just
different kind of corner.

39:39.474 --> 39:41.041
My son...

39:41.076 --> 39:43.341
My son's not crazy. He's not a killer.

39:43.376 --> 39:45.642
H-He was... He was
pushed to do something.

39:45.678 --> 39:47.610
I need people to understand that.

39:47.645 --> 39:49.844
If you tell me to...

39:49.880 --> 39:52.546
there are things that I could
find out about that school

39:52.581 --> 39:54.213
and how they treated your son.

39:54.249 --> 39:56.682
You can do that?

39:56.716 --> 39:58.282
There's always something... always.

39:58.318 --> 40:00.716
And then you... you...
you'll take that to the police?

40:00.751 --> 40:03.751
The police... they... they don't care.

40:03.787 --> 40:06.886
There's no one else, Mrs. Blaine.

40:06.921 --> 40:09.854
No one.

40:09.890 --> 40:13.456
I know you got to think,
why is this idiot talking to me?

40:13.491 --> 40:16.957
He's just some guy out here by himself.

40:16.993 --> 40:18.191
Yeah.

40:18.226 --> 40:19.526
I'm alone.

40:19.561 --> 40:22.660
But if you're gonna stand
up for what's right,

40:22.696 --> 40:25.128
sometimes you got to stand apart.

40:28.265 --> 40:29.863
Yeah.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.633
Okay.

40:35.235 --> 40:37.401
There are so many
different aspects to bullying.

40:37.437 --> 40:38.935
It's not just a gay thing.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.270
It is definitely, um, a class thing.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.704
It's a "you don't do sports" thing.

40:42.739 --> 40:45.172
People, when A.J. killed himself,

40:45.206 --> 40:47.238
said that he took the easy way out,

40:47.274 --> 40:49.206
and that made me so mad

40:49.241 --> 40:52.875
because A.J. fought
every day of his life.

40:52.911 --> 40:55.409
He was constantly battling ignorance.

40:55.445 --> 40:57.243
I feel so comfortable saying

40:57.279 --> 41:00.212
that I'm a gender-nonconforming
black person,

41:00.247 --> 41:02.580
and living... living in that truth

41:02.615 --> 41:03.914
has saved my life.

41:03.949 --> 41:06.948
The things that brought me
back to a place of center

41:06.983 --> 41:11.184
were my... my children,
relationships with, you know,

41:11.219 --> 41:16.087
with... with my wife and friends
and the, uh, the strength

41:16.122 --> 41:20.022
and enduring qualities of all of
us that came back together.

41:20.057 --> 41:23.323
Those things all were
pieces that, you know,

41:23.359 --> 41:25.257
kind of put me back together.

41:25.293 --> 41:28.692
I mean, you know, my son was 8 years old

41:28.728 --> 41:30.360
when the shootings happened.

41:30.395 --> 41:32.694
And I just kept looking at him, going,

41:32.730 --> 41:34.695
"Are you Dylan and I don't know it?"

41:35.305 --> 41:41.942
