00:01.484 --> 00:04.317
Okay, how about this?
If you let me have Jake this Easter,

00:04.387 --> 00:06.821
you can have him the Fourth of July
and Labor Day.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.653
No. That doesn't work for me at all.

00:08.725 --> 00:10.818
How about I give you
all the Jewish holidays?

00:10.894 --> 00:13.226
When did we become Jewish, Alan?

00:13.329 --> 00:15.297
It's still holidays.

00:21.137 --> 00:23.298
Your brother's a schmuck.

00:24.708 --> 00:27.142
What are they arguing about now?

00:27.544 --> 00:29.034
It's actually kind of ironic.

00:29.145 --> 00:31.739
They're arguing about who gets you
on what days.

00:31.848 --> 00:33.406
That is ironic.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.408
You know what "ironic" means?

00:36.519 --> 00:38.419
No, but I trust you.

00:40.356 --> 00:44.417
What's ironic is while they're arguing
about who gets you, I get you.

00:44.527 --> 00:47.928
And you know what?
It's not such a big deal.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.495
No offense, but let's face it, you're 10.

00:52.569 --> 00:55.003
I can't take you to Vegas,
we can't double-date.

00:55.071 --> 00:58.529
And when was the last time
you picked up a check, you mooch?

00:58.908 --> 01:00.671
I'm almost 11.

01:02.245 --> 01:03.712
Okay, I think we've got it.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.112
I get him Thanksgiving,
you get him Halloween.

01:06.216 --> 01:08.616
You get him Christmas Eve,
I get him Christmas Day.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.278
- I get him Yom Kippur.
- And I get Hanukkah.

01:12.555 --> 01:15.388
Hey, guys, I just found out.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.922
Jake's birthday is, like, in a week.

01:19.929 --> 01:22.227
Shouldn't we make plans?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.259
You're right, he's a schmuck.

01:25.368 --> 01:26.562
What?

01:26.669 --> 01:29.229
We know when his birthday is, Charlie.
We were there.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.536
But only one of us got a needle
shoved in their spine.

01:32.609 --> 01:34.577
You begged for that.

01:35.678 --> 01:39.170
Anyway, you, me, and Mom are taking
Jake to a show at the Magic Castle.

01:39.249 --> 01:40.273
You invited Mom?

01:40.383 --> 01:43.546
You want to tell her she can't come
to her grandchild's birthday?

01:43.620 --> 01:45.713
'Cause believe me, I tried.

01:46.055 --> 01:47.386
Oh, man.

01:47.457 --> 01:48.856
Look at the bright side.

01:48.925 --> 01:52.122
Maybe we can bribe one of the
magicians to get her sawed in half.

01:52.228 --> 01:54.890
Or better still, thrown in a wood chipper.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.798
Judith and her sister
are going to join us as well.

02:00.303 --> 02:02.396
Which sister, the brunette or the blonde?

02:02.472 --> 02:04.372
The brunette. Why?

02:04.440 --> 02:07.238
Just curious. I never slept with the blonde.

02:07.811 --> 02:10.644
And you're not gonna sleep
with the brunette again, either.

02:10.747 --> 02:12.612
Relax, that was 12 years ago.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.909
Well, thank you.

02:13.983 --> 02:16.713
Let's just wait
till we get a look at her now.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.364 --> 02:29.854
Happy birthday!

02:29.966 --> 02:32.161
A magic set? Awesome.

02:32.268 --> 02:35.431
How lovely.
Perhaps he'll grow up to be a carny.

02:38.141 --> 02:42.771
It includes 14 different illusions
that will amaze and astound your friends.

02:42.846 --> 02:45.974
But, of course, your friends
may be smarter than mine.

02:46.282 --> 02:48.944
- Cool!
- Have fun at the Magic Castle.

02:49.018 --> 02:50.576
Aren't you coming with us?

02:50.653 --> 02:53.816
I wish I could, but I gotta go
to some clown's wedding.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.686
I'll try and come back for cake, okay?

02:55.792 --> 02:58.260
- Thanks a lot, Rose.
- You're welcome. Bye, Evelyn.

02:58.328 --> 03:00.626
Bye-bye. Thank you so much.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.595
Poor soul.

03:02.999 --> 03:05.194
I'm sure she meant well.

03:05.869 --> 03:07.131
Now.

03:07.203 --> 03:09.364
Open Grandmommy's present.

03:11.975 --> 03:14.273
- Clothes?
- Happy birthday.

03:14.344 --> 03:16.471
Thanks a lot, but clothes?

03:17.146 --> 03:19.478
Not clothes, darling.

03:19.549 --> 03:21.449
It's Calvin Klein.

03:23.152 --> 03:24.847
No, it's clothes.

03:25.488 --> 03:28.855
Believe me, sweetheart,
the girls are gonna love you in this.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.653
What girls?

03:30.727 --> 03:33.890
All right, the other boys will be envious.

03:33.997 --> 03:36.693
The other boys will beat me up.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.962
Well, there's just no pleasing you,
is there?

03:43.306 --> 03:45.501
Almost ready?
Judith and Liz will be here soon.

03:45.575 --> 03:47.236
Liz. Thank you.

03:50.179 --> 03:52.477
Boy, that would have been embarrassing.

03:52.548 --> 03:55.039
Charlie, please don't make
a bad situation worse.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.813
Judith and Liz have been
at each other's throats for years.

03:57.887 --> 03:59.013
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

03:59.088 --> 04:01.886
Maybe it's because Liz
was always more popular.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.891
Maybe because Judith was smarter.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.757
Maybe, and this is just a theory
on my part,

04:06.863 --> 04:08.922
it had something to do with the fact that

04:09.032 --> 04:12.524
Liz did my brother in the coatroom
at our wedding reception.

04:13.870 --> 04:16.100
Well, no secret why she was popular.

04:20.610 --> 04:22.942
At our wedding reception, Charlie.

04:23.546 --> 04:25.013
In the coatroom.

04:25.081 --> 04:27.072
You were louder than the band.

04:29.485 --> 04:31.646
Hey, you make it sound so sleazy.

04:32.422 --> 04:34.822
I'm sorry. Class it up for me.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.850
Okay, to begin with,
we were on a mink coat.

04:38.928 --> 04:40.190
Goodbye.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.067
And I was wearing a tuxedo.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.430
It's an 11-year-old's birthday party.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.733
You could've at least put on a bra.

04:51.941 --> 04:54.205
Some of us don't need bras.

04:55.411 --> 04:57.845
Some of us have had husbands
and children.

04:57.914 --> 04:59.677
I've had husbands.

05:02.752 --> 05:05.243
And please, would you behave yourself
with Charlie?

05:05.355 --> 05:06.583
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

05:06.689 --> 05:11.183
I don't want a repeat of what happened
in the coatroom at my wedding reception.

05:11.761 --> 05:13.388
That was Charlie?

05:15.732 --> 05:18.200
Hey, soul sisters. Come on in.

05:18.468 --> 05:19.594
Hello, Alan.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.795
Alan, you look fantastic.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.395
I guess single life really agrees with you.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.066
You know,

05:26.142 --> 05:27.302
doing okay.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.776
Starting over, landed on my feet.

05:29.879 --> 05:31.244
Like a cat.

05:32.281 --> 05:33.475
Hey, Mom.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.778
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

05:35.885 --> 05:38.410
- Hey, Aunt Liz.
- There's my favorite nephew.

05:38.488 --> 05:40.456
Happy birthday, sweetie.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.421
It isn't clothes, is it?

05:43.726 --> 05:45.591
This is a surprise.

05:45.661 --> 05:46.821
Hello, Evelyn.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.397
It's not a surprise. I told her.

05:50.166 --> 05:54.102
You're looking very well.
Slimming down nicely.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.232
Thanks. I recently dropped 160 pounds.

06:01.677 --> 06:02.939
152.

06:05.581 --> 06:07.276
I take Pilates.

06:11.988 --> 06:13.114
Hey, everybody.

06:13.222 --> 06:15.486
Uncle Charlie, look what Aunt Liz got me.

06:15.591 --> 06:16.888
Awesome.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.887
I don't suppose you thought to buy him
a safety helmet.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.454
You ride with Aunt Liz,
you take your chances. Right, Liz?

06:28.104 --> 06:29.935
This guy? Are you sure?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.309
- Alan?
- Yeah, Mom.

06:37.413 --> 06:40.644
Now that we've seen the dove disappear
up the greasy man's sleeve,

06:40.750 --> 06:43.344
how about we stop for a little drinkie-poo?

06:43.786 --> 06:47.449
Mom, it's still Jake's birthday.
We're going home for cake.

06:47.523 --> 06:48.956
Okay.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.993
But first a drinkie-poo.

06:51.861 --> 06:54.762
Don't you think you had enough
to drink at the magic show?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.959
Excuse me, but some of us
deal with our boredom and depression

06:58.034 --> 07:00.867
the old-fashioned, non-prescription way.

07:02.939 --> 07:05.703
- That's telling her, Evelyn.
- Now, see.

07:05.808 --> 07:09.175
This one gets me.
Alan, you married the wrong sister.

07:10.313 --> 07:13.146
Why don't you lie down back there,
take a little nap?

07:13.216 --> 07:14.649
Okey-dokey.

07:19.956 --> 07:22.117
How can you not remember the coatroom?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.022
I remember the coatroom.

07:24.127 --> 07:26.322
I just don't remember you.

07:26.395 --> 07:28.329
How can you not remember me?

07:28.397 --> 07:31.127
Do you remember everyone
you've had sex with?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.394
Of course not.

07:32.502 --> 07:34.902
But come on, we're practically family.

07:36.639 --> 07:39.005
Okay, Dad, see this ring?

07:39.075 --> 07:41.509
It's made of one unbroken piece
of stainless steel.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.044
I can see that.

07:43.146 --> 07:45.671
And this one is just the same. I swear.

07:46.482 --> 07:48.950
- I believe you.
- Now watch.

07:49.018 --> 07:51.111
One, two, three.

07:52.321 --> 07:53.618
Hold on.

07:54.524 --> 07:56.492
One, two, three.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.020
Ironic.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.293
Wait, don't look.

08:03.799 --> 08:06.700
Alan, how are those
magic fingers of yours?

08:06.802 --> 08:07.962
I'm sorry?

08:08.037 --> 08:11.234
I have this kink in my back
and I was hoping you could give me

08:11.340 --> 08:14.332
one of your fantastic adjustments
when we get home.

08:16.546 --> 08:17.843
Sure, I suppose.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.542
Thank you. I can't wait.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.046
Wait a minute.
His magic fingers you remember?

08:25.154 --> 08:26.485
Ta-da!

08:31.627 --> 08:33.059
This is really weird.

08:33.129 --> 08:36.030
Yeah. How could she not remember me?

08:38.400 --> 08:41.097
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

08:41.203 --> 08:43.433
Judith's sister's hitting on me.

08:43.539 --> 08:46.872
She's not hitting on you.
She's hitting on her sister's ex-husband.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.467
But that's me.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.910
Stop taking it personally.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.074
You said it yourself. They've been going
at each other for years.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.618
And let's examine the current situation.

08:56.719 --> 09:00.382
Nothing Liz does with me
is gonna make Judith any madder.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.447
I've already flown my mission.

09:04.994 --> 09:07.827
The only play she has left
is to sleep with you.

09:07.930 --> 09:10.091
Well, that's not gonna happen.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.600
Well, certainly not with that attitude.

09:14.837 --> 09:17.704
Now, come on, you can't say
you've never thought about it.

09:17.773 --> 09:19.104
Liz? No.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.042
Alan.

09:21.110 --> 09:22.805
Look me in the eye.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.572
Okay, I'm looking.

09:25.915 --> 09:28.816
Tell me you've never thought
about being with Liz.

09:29.085 --> 09:31.747
You know, you have very curly eyelashes.

09:33.222 --> 09:35.816
- Answer the question.
- Come on, Charlie.

09:35.925 --> 09:37.984
- It's my ex-wife's sister.
- Exactly.

09:38.094 --> 09:41.427
Sisters are like
the Holy Grail of recreational sex.

09:43.099 --> 09:46.330
Technically, it'd be twins,
but that's such a biological oddity,

09:46.435 --> 09:48.266
it's hardly worth pursuing.

09:49.071 --> 09:50.595
Dad, pick a card.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.400
Okay.

09:53.809 --> 09:55.174
Seven of diamonds?

09:55.278 --> 09:56.336
No.

09:58.314 --> 09:59.804
Eight of spades?

09:59.915 --> 10:00.973
No.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.976
- Ace of clubs?
- No.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.613
Is it black or red?

10:12.595 --> 10:14.927
We'll just have the cake, and then we'll go.

10:14.997 --> 10:16.157
You can go if you want.

10:16.265 --> 10:19.098
I'll have Alan drive me home
after he adjusts me.

10:19.468 --> 10:20.935
Why are you doing this?

10:21.003 --> 10:22.129
Doing what?

10:22.204 --> 10:23.364
Alan.

10:24.006 --> 10:26.839
- You want him back, don't you?
- No, I don't want him back.

10:26.942 --> 10:29.706
Then why do you care what I do with him?

10:29.812 --> 10:32.440
If you're determined to do
something stupid today,

10:32.515 --> 10:34.847
I'd actually prefer you do Charlie.

10:36.018 --> 10:39.181
So would Charlie,
but we can't always get what we want.

10:40.356 --> 10:43.553
Wow! That's a lot of candles.

10:43.659 --> 10:44.956
He's still 11, right?

10:45.027 --> 10:47.655
You want to deal with the candles?
Is that what you want?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.857
- No, I'm fine.
- So, Alan.

10:49.965 --> 10:52.490
When do you think you'll be ready for me?

10:52.835 --> 10:54.302
Maybe after the cake.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.496
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.005
You just say the word, and we'll do it.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.207
In high school, the word was "hello. "

11:03.579 --> 11:05.843
Don't pretend you don't know
what she's doing.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.213
Her back hurts, Judith.
She wants an adjustment.

11:08.317 --> 11:09.909
She doesn't want an adjustment.

11:10.019 --> 11:12.920
And why do you think her back hurts
in the first place?

11:13.022 --> 11:14.546
So, she does need an adjustment.

11:14.657 --> 11:17.091
I forbid you to have anything
to do with my sister.

11:17.193 --> 11:19.161
Really? You forbid me?
I've got news for you.

11:19.228 --> 11:21.662
We're not married anymore.
You don't get to forbid me.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.426
- I'm warning you.
- What warning?

11:23.532 --> 11:25.727
- What happened to forbidding?
- Just listen to me.

11:25.835 --> 11:28.065
If you lay one magic little finger on Liz,

11:28.170 --> 11:31.606
- you and I will have a big problem.
- What are you gonna do? Divorce me?

11:31.707 --> 11:33.334
Marry me again and then divorce me?

11:33.409 --> 11:34.603
You want to see a trick?

11:34.710 --> 11:37.178
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure, honey.

11:37.246 --> 11:39.680
<i>"Good evening, sir or madame.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:41.913
"Have we ever met before?"

11:44.520 --> 11:46.181
So, Liz.

11:46.255 --> 11:49.190
The wedding reception, the coatroom.

11:49.759 --> 11:51.522
Did I ever say thank you?

11:52.762 --> 11:54.923
I don't really remember, Charlie.

11:55.865 --> 11:59.096
Well, let me just say, long overdue then,

11:59.201 --> 12:00.566
thank you.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.965
Okay.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.772
And not just for the one time.

12:07.877 --> 12:11.813
Over the years, I've actually used
the mental picture of that night as

12:11.914 --> 12:13.973
lighter fluid when I'm,

12:15.751 --> 12:18.242
you know, barbecuing alone.

12:21.223 --> 12:23.384
Hey, come on, that's a compliment.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.427
- Hey, Grandma?
- What?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.330
<i>Now, madame,
keep your eye on the magic ball.</i>

12:34.437 --> 12:36.029
Watch closely.

12:36.138 --> 12:37.799
No, wait.

12:38.474 --> 12:42.968
Okay, now I'll take the magic ball
from my left hand and put it into my right.

12:44.046 --> 12:47.641
See? Now I'll throw the magic ball
back into the cup.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.986
You think it's under the cup?

12:51.554 --> 12:53.545
Do I think what's under the cup?

12:53.656 --> 12:55.214
The magic ball.

12:55.624 --> 12:58.286
Very good, dear.

13:12.241 --> 13:14.835
Good Lord, how long have I been asleep?

13:15.511 --> 13:17.035
Make a wish, buddy.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.848
I've already made my wish.

13:23.919 --> 13:26.513
- Don't you dare.
- Now we're daring?

13:26.589 --> 13:28.716
Warning, forbidding, and daring?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.587
I want to talk to you.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.991
- Are you hearing this?
- I'm trying.

13:35.097 --> 13:37.565
- What is your problem?
- You are my problem.

13:37.666 --> 13:40.863
- Why are they fighting?
- They're not fighting. They're discussing.

13:40.936 --> 13:43.928
I'm a child of divorce, Dad.
I know the difference.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.741
- You're a selfish, hateful person.
- Maybe you should go to your room.

13:47.843 --> 13:50.175
- It's my birthday.
- Ironic, huh?

13:51.847 --> 13:53.280
Hi, everybody.

13:54.884 --> 13:55.908
Sorry I'm late.

13:56.018 --> 13:59.351
Actually, you're right on time.
Here's $50. Take Jake to the arcade,

13:59.421 --> 14:01.514
and don't come back
till you're out of quarters.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.615
Okay. Come on, Jake.

14:03.726 --> 14:05.785
Cool. So, how was the wedding?

14:05.895 --> 14:07.419
It was a circus.

14:07.963 --> 14:10.090
Bye, honey. Have fun.

14:10.199 --> 14:13.191
You were always a cheap slut
and you haven't changed.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.705
I was the slut?
Miss Technically-I'm-Still-A-Virgin.

14:17.039 --> 14:18.973
Girls, that's no way to talk.

14:24.413 --> 14:28.213
Ever since we were kids, anytime I loved
something, you took it away from me.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.377
But you will not take away
my ex-husband.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.215
- You love me?
- What? No!

14:32.288 --> 14:34.381
I'm trying to make a point here.

14:34.557 --> 14:37.617
Judith, if I wanted Alan,
I could've had him a long time ago.

14:37.726 --> 14:39.250
What the hell does that mean?

14:39.328 --> 14:41.489
- You never told her?
- Told me what?

14:42.998 --> 14:45.762
Well, I mean, it's no big deal.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.165
Really.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.264
It's just that

14:49.338 --> 14:51.636
before I asked you out,

14:51.974 --> 14:54.340
I asked Liz out.

14:57.513 --> 14:59.105
You lied to me?

15:00.916 --> 15:04.113
If I had said yes,
you never would have dated him.

15:04.186 --> 15:06.154
So, I was your second choice?

15:06.255 --> 15:07.847
No.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.083
Chronologically, yes.

15:11.927 --> 15:14.452
But in my heart, you were always first.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.623
But in reality, you were second.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.864
And you never told me this?

15:20.302 --> 15:22.293
Well, you can kind of see why.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.469
You know, this

15:25.541 --> 15:28.442
wouldn't have happened if you were twins.

15:29.712 --> 15:31.373
Okay. Fine.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.938
You always wanted Liz?
Go ahead, here's your chance.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.848
Give her your little adjustment.

15:36.952 --> 15:39.182
While you're having
a good time with my sister,

15:39.288 --> 15:41.779
I'll have a good time with your brother.

15:42.391 --> 15:43.722
Beg pardon?

15:44.727 --> 15:48.493
Don't be coy with me. You know we've
always had sexual tension between us.

15:48.564 --> 15:51.556
Really? I thought it was
just regular tension.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.328
Come on, I've seen you looking
at my chest.

15:54.403 --> 15:56.394
You looked at my wife's chest?

15:56.805 --> 15:58.363
Hey, I'm a guy.

15:58.741 --> 16:01.232
I will rock his world, Alan, I swear.

16:01.343 --> 16:03.538
- You're bluffing.
- Am I? Watch me.

16:03.646 --> 16:05.341
- Come on, Charlie.
- Alan?

16:05.414 --> 16:07.473
- She's bluffing, Charlie.
- Are you sure?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.176
Trust me, she hates you.

16:09.251 --> 16:11.742
Trust me. That doesn't always stop them.

16:12.087 --> 16:14.715
Come on, Alan,
I'll show you where it hurts.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.881
Clear something up for me.

16:16.992 --> 16:19.324
Chiropractic adjustment,
that's just a euphemism?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.829
- Right.
- So, we're really gonna do this?

16:22.698 --> 16:24.757
Wow, I thought we were bluffing.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.073
- Okay, we were bluffing.
- Us, too.

17:50.786 --> 17:53.584
My God, that clown has no legs!

17:59.528 --> 18:01.587
Okay, you see the coin?

18:01.697 --> 18:04.598
You're supposed to say,
"Have we ever met before?"

18:07.202 --> 18:10.535
Just watch the trick, okay?
We'll work on the patter later.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.598
You see the coin?

18:12.708 --> 18:15.040
Now, I grab it with this hand

18:15.444 --> 18:16.934
and I blow,

18:17.846 --> 18:19.074
and it's gone.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.577
Where do you think it is?

18:22.518 --> 18:23.917
It's right here.

18:33.962 --> 18:36.021
How the hell did you do that?

18:36.899 --> 18:38.366
Ironic, huh?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.090
