- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

00:46.263 --> 00:49.623
- More coffee, dear?
- Yes. Yes.

00:50.256 --> 00:53.648
Fools don't know how to run a
foot race, let alone a country.

01:00.691 --> 01:02.351
What?!

01:02.737 --> 01:04.388
What's this, then?

01:04.429 --> 01:06.075
What is it, dear?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.211
Is this one of your
little practical jokes?

01:09.245 --> 01:12.290
Well I'm not laughing, Dorothy.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.650
I... I assure you, Harrison,
I know nothing of this.

01:15.698 --> 01:17.885
Maybe it was Roger then.

01:18.609 --> 01:20.856
Scoundrel's always coveted
my position at the bank.

01:20.890 --> 01:23.894
- Perhaps it's just a mistake, dear.
- A mistake, my foot!

01:24.319 --> 01:26.420
Where are you going?

01:26.476 --> 01:29.904
Straight to the newspaper to
give them a piece of my mind.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.847
All right, dear.

01:44.390 --> 01:47.845
Hm?

01:57.515 --> 01:59.474
Oh...

02:05.542 --> 02:08.604
He had only just stepped
out the door when...

02:08.729 --> 02:11.723
Where he was going?

02:13.152 --> 02:17.312
- To the offices of the Toronto Gazette.
- For what purpose?

02:17.748 --> 02:22.309
Harrison had meant to complain
to the paper about a...

02:22.434 --> 02:25.480
a dreadful error they'd
made in the morning edition.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.356
Ahem.

02:33.082 --> 02:34.939
It's so cruel.

02:35.907 --> 02:37.599
It makes no sense.

02:37.812 --> 02:40.802
This is the paper he
was holding when he died?

02:41.738 --> 02:45.209
What kind of a horrible
person would do such a thing?

02:45.233 --> 02:48.475
- _
- His own obituary.

02:54.613 --> 02:57.115
Not much mystery as
to the cause of death.

02:57.162 --> 02:58.964
Certainly not.

02:58.987 --> 03:01.526
It is unfortunate
timing for the poor man.

03:01.828 --> 03:05.158
I suspect there's more at
play here than mere bad luck.

03:05.283 --> 03:08.273
It's unlikely the planter
fell of its own accord.

03:08.304 --> 03:11.144
And there's the curious
matter of this obituary...

03:11.200 --> 03:13.001
The damndest thing!

03:13.035 --> 03:16.380
A dead man whose obituary
was published before he died.

03:16.408 --> 03:17.754
Yes. We were just discussing that.

03:17.770 --> 03:19.391
More than passing strange.

03:19.423 --> 03:21.933
- Definitely needs to be looked into.
- Indeed.

03:22.058 --> 03:24.088
The obituary in effect predicted

03:24.144 --> 03:25.679
the exact day the fellow would die.

03:25.687 --> 03:27.599
Suggesting the writer played a part

03:27.630 --> 03:29.960
in making the obituary come true.

03:30.219 --> 03:31.793
My thoughts exactly.

03:31.801 --> 03:34.489
His neighbours claim
he was a bad sort, so...

03:34.614 --> 03:36.791
I pulled his crime sheet.

03:37.452 --> 03:39.081
He had a criminal record?

03:39.104 --> 03:41.796
For petty theft and
gambling offenses and such.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.766
I understood him to be a bank manager.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.284
His garb is certainly fitting
of a trussed-up man of money.

03:48.945 --> 03:52.431
- That's not Gibson.
- Gibson? Who is Gibson?

03:52.556 --> 03:55.877
There! That's Murray
Gibson's body coming in now.

03:55.911 --> 03:57.514
He fell off his fire escape.

03:57.522 --> 04:00.387
This man's name was
Harrison McCallister.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.061
That's Gibson.

04:06.548 --> 04:09.891
Both published hours
before their actual deaths,

04:09.925 --> 04:12.593
and both dying of apparent accidents.

04:13.285 --> 04:16.273
- What's the connection?
- I don't know.

04:16.475 --> 04:18.608
They were both placed
in the early edition

04:18.640 --> 04:20.440
of the Toronto Gazette.

04:29.827 --> 04:32.181
I just love seeing you in your uniform.

04:32.182 --> 04:33.352
Ahh!

04:33.477 --> 04:36.460
Give us a moment, McNabb. A
bit early for you, isn't it?

04:36.494 --> 04:38.825
Well, I wanted to tell you
as soon as I knew for certain.

04:38.854 --> 04:39.962
Knew what?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.769
Some of the girls have
got a show together,

04:41.788 --> 04:44.791
and they've been offered a
spot at the Moulin Rouge...

04:45.459 --> 04:46.730
in Paris.

04:46.944 --> 04:48.241
Well, that's fantastic.

04:48.298 --> 04:50.541
Travelling expands the mind, you know.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.251
I'm one of the girls.

04:54.422 --> 04:56.286
- Paris?
- Yes.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.313
From what I hear Paris is a...

04:58.344 --> 05:00.786
a veritable den of
thieves and cutthroats.

05:00.818 --> 05:03.292
Which is why I would
like a Constable with me,

05:03.336 --> 05:05.998
- to keep me safe.
- I don't know, Nina.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.289
Newfoundland is the furthest
I've ever been from Canada.

05:08.346 --> 05:10.228
I mean, I can't imagine what
a journey like that would cost.

05:10.247 --> 05:12.991
Oh, don't worry about the
cost! I've got a double berth.

05:13.557 --> 05:15.181
So you'll come?

05:15.465 --> 05:16.717
Thank you.

05:18.423 --> 05:22.230
The obituaries editor can't
confirm who posted the notices.

05:22.264 --> 05:23.504
They were typewritten,

05:23.523 --> 05:25.462
placed through the mail
slot with a cash payment.

05:25.495 --> 05:27.637
Is that the usual way of these things?

05:27.685 --> 05:29.303
He saw nothing amiss.

05:29.723 --> 05:30.944
Sir,

05:31.069 --> 05:34.740
someone's come in to report an
obituary written about themselves.

05:34.865 --> 05:36.351
Right. Bring him in, George.

05:36.389 --> 05:38.384
It's not a him, sir, it...

05:39.769 --> 05:41.639
Oh. Good morning, Sister.

05:41.670 --> 05:44.485
Sister AnnaMaria. It's a
pleasure to meet you, Detective.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.580
I understand you've found an obituary...

05:47.587 --> 05:49.023
About myself.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.494
And as you can well see, I'm
standing right here in front of you,

05:52.503 --> 05:55.893
living and breathing and
still in my earthly vestments.

05:55.906 --> 05:58.109
Someone has made a terrible mistake.

05:58.172 --> 06:01.836
It may not be a mistake, exactly.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.405
What do you mean?

06:04.815 --> 06:08.466
This isn't the first such
obituary we've found today.

06:08.591 --> 06:11.457
Sister, as a precaution,
I would ask that

06:11.488 --> 06:13.881
you remain here at the
Station House for a time.

06:15.465 --> 06:17.905
Certainly. I'll do whatever you say.

06:18.082 --> 06:21.714
George, if you could
find Sister AnnaMaria

06:21.757 --> 06:23.925
- a comfortable spot...
- Right away, sir.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.599
Sister?

06:28.878 --> 06:31.132
A banker, a gambler, and a nun.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.669
It sounds like the beginning
of an unfortunate joke.

06:34.663 --> 06:36.621
Three fraudulent obituaries.

06:36.659 --> 06:38.314
What if there are more?

06:41.462 --> 06:42.610
George!

06:43.400 --> 06:44.949
Sir.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.051
Thank you very much.

06:47.176 --> 06:49.626
- Here you go.
- Just over here.

06:51.364 --> 06:52.578
Excuse me, sir.

06:52.584 --> 06:53.969
Where to, Constable?

06:54.094 --> 06:56.840
Actually, I was wondering
if you knew anything

06:56.859 --> 06:59.641
about the gentleman mentioned
in this obituary. Joshua Martin.

07:00.113 --> 07:01.605
Indeed I do.

07:01.636 --> 07:04.443
He was my father. I
buried him this morning.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.483
My condolences.

07:07.672 --> 07:09.076
Thank you.

07:10.071 --> 07:12.249
Don't be so stupid!

07:12.299 --> 07:14.408
He died two days ago.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.890
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

07:37.655 --> 07:39.600
Sir, are you Leonard Stoker?

07:39.645 --> 07:41.533
- Yes. What of it?
- Good!

07:41.867 --> 07:45.048
- So you're not dead, then.
- Is that some kind of threat?

07:45.066 --> 07:47.174
No, no, no, no, no.
But I... I will need you

07:47.175 --> 07:48.333
to come down to the Station House.

07:48.339 --> 07:50.089
That must be for somebody else.

07:50.354 --> 07:52.425
Is there more than one Leonard Stoker,

07:52.444 --> 07:55.497
1901 heavyweight boxing
champion of Toronto?

08:00.774 --> 08:02.517
Look.

08:10.197 --> 08:11.928
Eddie Crawford.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.761
- I... didn't do anything wrong.
- I didn't say you did.

08:15.818 --> 08:18.361
Oh, well... So what's on your mind?

08:18.392 --> 08:20.105
Saving your life.

08:22.428 --> 08:24.411
- You're pulling my leg.
- I wish I were.

08:24.443 --> 08:26.520
We need you to come down to
the Station House right away.

08:26.551 --> 08:29.132
- Over a silly prank?
- Eddie, two of the pranks

08:29.170 --> 08:30.648
on this page have just been killed.

08:30.686 --> 08:33.205
Regardless of what we think of
you, we don't want you to be next.

08:33.671 --> 08:35.049
Come on.

08:44.989 --> 08:47.551
Well, if it isn't my old
friend Eddie Crawford.

08:47.869 --> 08:50.604
You can wager I'm as glad
to see you as you are me.

08:50.623 --> 08:52.990
True enough. Even so,

08:53.197 --> 08:55.149
I'd rather see you alive than dead.

08:55.274 --> 08:57.233
Well, that's very
kind of you, Inspector.

08:57.358 --> 08:59.499
What's going on with these obituaries?

08:59.681 --> 09:02.092
Some creative genius
is making every effort

09:02.105 --> 09:04.485
to make his fictional writing come true.

09:05.329 --> 09:07.788
You're one of the lucky
ones who's not dead yet.

09:07.823 --> 09:09.106
Ooh!

09:15.609 --> 09:16.956
Can I help you?

09:16.981 --> 09:19.078
I went to make a
complaint at the newspaper

09:19.090 --> 09:21.812
- and they sent me here.
- Oh dear. An obituary?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.616
Yes, how did you know?

09:24.072 --> 09:26.557
See? For Agnes Swift,

09:26.682 --> 09:28.641
with all the correct details.

09:29.415 --> 09:31.096
That makes six.

09:31.221 --> 09:32.632
Six what?

09:33.992 --> 09:35.502
Just a moment.

09:38.599 --> 09:40.903
Oh. Mrs. Swift?

09:41.218 --> 09:42.615
It's Miss.

09:44.503 --> 09:46.537
Might we have a moment?

09:47.657 --> 09:49.696
Hello there, young miss.

09:49.721 --> 09:53.272
I find myself wondering what your
favourite school subjects might be.

09:53.568 --> 09:55.966
Miss Swift. There are
others who have had

09:55.985 --> 09:58.031
similar obituaries written about them.

09:58.037 --> 09:59.283
Two died earlier this morning,

09:59.308 --> 10:01.423
shortly after this paper was published,

10:01.612 --> 10:06.304
most likely killed by whoever
wrote and posted these.

10:07.342 --> 10:09.850
- Good Lord!
- Yes.

10:09.884 --> 10:12.827
We were hoping that you would
remain here at the Station House

10:12.842 --> 10:15.006
so that we may ensure your safety.

10:15.038 --> 10:16.549
You don't understand.

10:16.596 --> 10:18.452
I'm Virginia Swift.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.089
The obituary wasn't written about me.

10:21.214 --> 10:23.798
Agnes Swift is my daughter.

10:36.961 --> 10:40.121
Could I trouble anyone for a cup of tea?

10:40.246 --> 10:43.626
I did ask that Constable,

10:43.639 --> 10:45.842
but he seems to have forgotten.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.548
We can see to that.

10:47.586 --> 10:50.651
Constable Brackenreid, tea
for Sister AnnaMaria, please?

10:50.651 --> 10:51.961
Yes, sir.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.630
We at Station House
Four greatly appreciate

10:55.648 --> 10:57.398
your cooperation in this investigation.

10:57.442 --> 11:00.124
How long is this gonna
take? I have a fight tonight.

11:00.162 --> 11:03.164
And I will need to be
back for afternoon prayers.

11:03.672 --> 11:05.424
We thank you for your patience.

11:05.449 --> 11:08.710
And as long as you're here
with us, you'll be safe.

11:08.741 --> 11:12.336
Meanwhile, we are working hard to
discover who is behind all of this.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.236
Once we find and apprehend the culprit,

11:14.255 --> 11:16.149
you'll all be free to
go about your business.

11:16.194 --> 11:18.853
We are here voluntarily. Right, Tom?

11:18.978 --> 11:21.160
As we said, for your safety.

11:21.195 --> 11:23.622
I've thought about it, and
believe I can fend for myself.

11:23.647 --> 11:26.994
Well no one intends to
get murdered, and yet...

11:27.404 --> 11:30.420
We also hope that you could
provide us with information

11:30.445 --> 11:32.792
that will help our
investigation, Mr. Crawford.

11:33.619 --> 11:35.492
We need help from each one of you.

11:35.617 --> 11:37.215
Firstly, with a list of people

11:37.235 --> 11:39.375
you believe may hold
a grudge against you,

11:39.400 --> 11:42.054
so that we could generate
a list of suspects.

11:42.084 --> 11:43.760
Performing a service Eddie,

11:44.153 --> 11:46.887
if you can get your tiny
little mind around that notion.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.253
Unfortunately,

11:48.479 --> 11:50.332
I have an urgent business
matter to attend to.

11:50.357 --> 11:52.185
Not so fast, bugalugs.

11:52.221 --> 11:53.410
The bookies can wait.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.771
This is outrageous.

11:55.806 --> 11:59.678
I am the victim here! You
can't keep me here like this.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.750
If I put a wee bit of effort into it,

12:02.775 --> 12:05.348
I just might find a warrant
for you that needs executing.

12:05.348 --> 12:06.853
Now sit down!

12:11.653 --> 12:14.739
Don't forget, you promised
we'd go to the fair today.

12:15.223 --> 12:18.290
We'll go as soon as we finish
our business here, Agnes.

12:18.315 --> 12:21.515
- But it's the...
- Just read your book.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.484
Sirs.

12:23.837 --> 12:26.268
Oof. Another poor sod.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.163
Who is it this time? Butcher, baker,

12:29.176 --> 12:32.025
- candlestick maker?
- Policeman.

12:33.095 --> 12:34.827
Bloody hell.

12:36.865 --> 12:39.910
- It's you, Watts.
- Hm.

12:40.886 --> 12:44.605
Wait, what?

12:56.122 --> 12:58.618
I've put my share of criminals away.

12:58.642 --> 13:01.762
Some are out of and could
prefer me dead over alive.

13:01.789 --> 13:03.260
- Oi!
- Hm?

13:03.443 --> 13:05.382
Oh. Yeah.

13:05.955 --> 13:08.441
Any one in particular
that might connect you

13:08.460 --> 13:10.449
to one of the obituary subjects?

13:10.481 --> 13:12.527
Besides meeting Mr. Crawford last week,

13:12.565 --> 13:15.130
I've never seen any of
these people before today.

13:15.592 --> 13:18.618
It may be helpful for you to
go through your past case files.

13:18.689 --> 13:21.634
They're at Station
One. I'll go fetch them.

13:21.655 --> 13:23.352
No, you won't. You're staying here.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.518
We'll send a constable
to get your files.

13:26.569 --> 13:29.016
I still have Gibson's
murder to investigate.

13:29.051 --> 13:30.748
I need to re-examine the crime scene,

13:30.751 --> 13:33.187
- track down his associates.
- Never mind all that.

13:33.257 --> 13:35.655
Whoever wrote these
obituaries, that's your killer.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.007
Inspector, I understand the threat

13:38.020 --> 13:40.053
and assure you I can
take care of myself.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.092
No one intends to get murdered...

13:43.030 --> 13:44.409
and yet...

13:52.554 --> 13:53.719
Right.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.675
We have some questions for you all.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.087
Detective.

13:57.483 --> 14:00.209
Firstly, it is vital that you tell us

14:00.259 --> 14:03.652
of any previous encounters you
may have had with one another,

14:03.696 --> 14:06.756
- even in passing.
- This is a waste of time.

14:06.793 --> 14:09.016
I live a very simple life.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.124
Sister, please think carefully.

14:11.249 --> 14:14.713
Now, Constable Higgins has
photographs of the two deceased men.

14:14.901 --> 14:16.652
One is a Murray Gibson,

14:16.696 --> 14:18.704
who was known to have
run-ins with the law.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.423
The other chap is a
Harrison McCallister,

14:21.454 --> 14:24.137
who was the manager of the
Dominion Bank on Jarvis Street.

14:24.395 --> 14:26.964
Do any of you know either
of these two gentlemen?

14:27.222 --> 14:31.748
My church diocese, of which
I am the financial secretary,

14:31.767 --> 14:33.856
holds its accounts at that bank.

14:33.894 --> 14:36.040
Sir. That's my bank as well.

14:36.424 --> 14:39.986
Anyone else have dealings with
the Dominion Bank on Jarvis Street?

14:40.295 --> 14:42.007
Banks are for chumps.

14:42.132 --> 14:45.028
That may not be the
connection we're looking for.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.937
Now, we ask that you please
write down anyone you can think of

14:48.949 --> 14:51.864
that may hold ill will toward you.

14:51.989 --> 14:53.443
Eddie.

14:54.413 --> 14:56.200
I'll be needing that back.

14:56.534 --> 14:58.693
Also, if you could please
write down your current

14:58.724 --> 15:02.211
and previous residence as
well as places of employment.

15:04.478 --> 15:06.902
How much longer do we
have to stay here, Momma?

15:07.229 --> 15:08.639
I don't know, Agnes.

15:09.248 --> 15:10.876
Just do what you've been asked.

15:11.203 --> 15:14.420
Write down the names of anyone you
can think of who's been mean to you.

15:20.081 --> 15:22.423
Miss Swift, if I could have a word?

15:23.209 --> 15:24.739
Of course.

15:32.953 --> 15:35.238
It occurs to me that

15:35.282 --> 15:39.858
you might know better than your
daughter who might wish to harm her.

15:41.615 --> 15:44.000
Save for a little schoolyard teasing,

15:44.718 --> 15:46.839
I can't think of a soul she's offended.

15:47.078 --> 15:48.860
I raised her to be polite.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.314
- You can see that for yourself.
- Indeed.

15:52.347 --> 15:55.370
Often in these cases, we
discover the involvement

15:55.414 --> 15:58.272
of another family member or loved one.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.671
She has no family but myself, Detective.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.817
Where is Agnes's father?

16:04.686 --> 16:05.983
He's dead.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.017
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:10.106 --> 16:12.202
He was never much in the picture.

16:13.077 --> 16:15.464
He used to make some
financial contribution.

16:16.874 --> 16:19.480
It's been a struggle to stay out
of the poor house since he's died.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.220
But we've managed.

16:22.237 --> 16:23.660
I see.

16:24.094 --> 16:27.360
I don't understand how anyone
could do this to a child.

16:28.981 --> 16:31.468
It's possible they haven't.

16:32.232 --> 16:34.262
Perhaps someone is making threats

16:34.301 --> 16:36.873
against Agnes as a means to hurt you.

16:37.086 --> 16:39.234
You think someone intends to kill me?

16:39.368 --> 16:40.969
I don't know.

16:41.003 --> 16:43.003
But if you wouldn't
mind, I would very much

16:43.027 --> 16:45.540
like you to compile a list of your own.

17:27.257 --> 17:29.717
Thank you very much. Thank you.

17:32.183 --> 17:34.080
Great.

17:47.284 --> 17:49.309
What's the point of these obituaries?

17:49.434 --> 17:51.916
What sort of crackpot would warn
these unlucky buggers in advance

17:51.947 --> 17:53.319
that they might be done in?

17:53.596 --> 17:57.145
A vengeful killer might take pleasure
in his intended victims' fear.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.576
There is a connection somewhere.

17:59.701 --> 18:01.282
Unless he picked them at random.

18:01.317 --> 18:03.045
It's possible, but not likely.

18:03.096 --> 18:05.922
Sequential killers are generally
quite specifically motivated.

18:06.047 --> 18:08.890
None of these names appear
on more than one list.

18:09.530 --> 18:11.693
Then it must be secondary connection.

18:16.065 --> 18:17.870
I'm sorry to interrupt.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.068
Could I have a word, Inspector?

18:20.685 --> 18:22.372
Of course.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.915
What is it, Sister?

18:25.978 --> 18:27.675
I saw

18:28.250 --> 18:29.975
that Constable

18:30.019 --> 18:33.236
coming out of your office
only a few moments ago,

18:33.249 --> 18:36.031
and he was counting some money.

18:36.439 --> 18:39.287
It made me fear the young
man might be a thief.

18:39.321 --> 18:41.823
Oh, thank you Sister.

18:41.857 --> 18:43.836
That's very kind of you to let me know.

18:44.315 --> 18:46.708
That young man just happens to be my son

18:47.111 --> 18:49.050
and he's about to head
off and buy his father

18:49.056 --> 18:50.762
his weekly bottle of scotch.

18:51.379 --> 18:53.028
I see.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.835
That's fine, then.

18:55.042 --> 18:57.176
Why don't you go back
and take your seat.

18:58.297 --> 19:00.022
Constable Brackenreid.

19:02.546 --> 19:04.278
When you go for my bottle,

19:04.523 --> 19:07.204
see if you can get this lot
some sandwiches for their lunch.

19:07.274 --> 19:08.596
Yes, sir.

19:13.965 --> 19:16.451
Our Sister of perpetual-
keeping-an-eye-on-things-

19:16.476 --> 19:18.478
and-not-minding-her-own-business.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.029
She told us she has no enemies.

19:21.063 --> 19:22.997
I very much doubt that.

19:23.866 --> 19:26.038
I'll have George visit the convent.

19:26.516 --> 19:28.764
If a nun has something to hide,

19:28.889 --> 19:31.772
what might the others
be keeping from us?

19:51.602 --> 19:53.434
You were trying to steal from me!

19:53.466 --> 19:55.063
That's a lie!

19:55.097 --> 19:57.031
Back away, Mr. Crawford.

19:57.066 --> 19:58.533
What's going on here?

19:58.567 --> 20:01.076
Agnes saw that thief
going through my handbag.

20:01.139 --> 20:03.838
I didn't touch your fusty old bag.

20:03.872 --> 20:05.400
I saw you.

20:05.602 --> 20:07.320
I'd believe anything my girl tells me

20:07.332 --> 20:09.366
before I'd give you the time of day.

20:09.674 --> 20:12.046
Are any of the items missing?

20:15.660 --> 20:18.386
No. We interrupted him in the act.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.049
All right. Well, why
don't you come with me?

20:20.062 --> 20:22.026
- But...
- Now, Mr. Crawford.

20:26.815 --> 20:28.216
Oh! I see

20:28.266 --> 20:30.743
Constable Brackenreid has
brought some refreshments.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.064
It's about time. I'm starved.

20:34.535 --> 20:37.601
Is there perhaps a little
bit of sugar to be had?

20:37.642 --> 20:38.956
Yes, I can get you some, Sister.

20:38.997 --> 20:40.795
Oh, I can see you're busy.

20:40.815 --> 20:43.750
Please don't trouble yourself.
I'll take it as it is.

20:45.105 --> 20:46.786
Please, help yourselves.

20:46.911 --> 20:48.382
This is all you've got?

20:49.209 --> 20:50.537
I'm a boxer.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.653
I need meat and potatoes.

21:03.023 --> 21:06.014
- What have you, George?
- Sir, I was rather surprised

21:06.019 --> 21:08.316
by the reaction I got from
people when I asked them about

21:08.356 --> 21:10.238
- Sister AnnaMaria.
- How so?

21:10.363 --> 21:12.406
Well, more than a few
people have rather...

21:12.632 --> 21:14.876
un-Christian feelings towards her, sir.

21:14.910 --> 21:16.171
She's not well-liked?

21:16.296 --> 21:17.708
No, in fact many people said

21:17.728 --> 21:19.219
that she's not very nice
for an ordinary person,

21:19.269 --> 21:20.377
let alone a nun.

21:20.870 --> 21:24.274
And yet she couldn't think of a
single person who bears her ill will.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.923
Let's have a chat with her, George.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.555
Help!

21:29.009 --> 21:31.300
Help!

21:35.197 --> 21:36.407
Sister!

21:36.442 --> 21:37.575
Sister!

22:03.933 --> 22:05.464
It may have been poison.

22:06.436 --> 22:07.831
How long ago?

22:07.911 --> 22:11.083
I can't be sure, but I will endeavour
to determine that right away.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.910
I'll have the remains of the meal
sent to the morgue for testing.

22:13.935 --> 22:15.068
Very good.

22:16.332 --> 22:18.497
You told us we would be safe here.

22:18.622 --> 22:20.728
That nun was killed
right in front of us.

22:20.803 --> 22:22.591
We don't know yet what caused her death.

22:22.626 --> 22:24.842
- She may have had a heart...
- We know perfectly well!

22:25.063 --> 22:26.987
She was murdered like the others.

22:27.310 --> 22:29.651
We'll continue to do the best we can.

22:29.903 --> 22:31.766
That's not been enough.

22:32.295 --> 22:34.158
If you could please excuse us.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.547
In my own bloody Station House!

22:42.582 --> 22:43.760
How did this happen, Murdoch?

22:43.770 --> 22:45.785
Dr. Ogden surmises it was poison.

22:45.815 --> 22:49.371
Possibly administered prior to
the nun's arrival at the station.

22:49.442 --> 22:52.680
George, what exactly did you
find out about Sister AnnaMaria?

22:52.720 --> 22:54.281
Well, as I was saying earlier, sir,

22:54.321 --> 22:56.684
the Sister proved to be
surprisingly unpopular

22:56.709 --> 22:58.739
- amongst those who knew her.
- And why was that?

22:59.147 --> 23:01.106
Well, it seems she liked
to get people into trouble.

23:01.141 --> 23:02.748
Just recently at the convent,

23:02.763 --> 23:05.604
there was another nun who
spoke during silent time.

23:05.729 --> 23:08.840
Sister AnnaMaria reported
her to the Mother Superior.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.739
There was a dog that
nipped at the gardener

23:10.754 --> 23:12.698
and even though he
didn't seem to mind much,

23:12.733 --> 23:16.082
she reported it to the
Animal Control Society,

23:16.087 --> 23:17.432
insisting the dog be put down.

23:17.468 --> 23:19.394
She even tried to snitch on my own son.

23:19.975 --> 23:22.145
- A habitual tattletale.
- Exactly, sir.

23:22.175 --> 23:25.030
She was known for getting
people fired: a bank clerk,

23:25.058 --> 23:27.156
a grocery boy, her mailman.

23:27.181 --> 23:29.495
But would that be
enough cause to kill her?

23:29.529 --> 23:31.310
Depends on the tattle and the tale.

23:31.764 --> 23:33.713
So what connects her
to the rest of them?

23:34.227 --> 23:38.489
Well, sir, the convent is located
somewhat near where Mr. Gibson lived.

23:38.489 --> 23:42.046
Then it's high time I revisit
his apartment, Inspector.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.991
If there's one thing
the nun's death tells us,

23:44.044 --> 23:46.579
it's that I'm no safer
here than anywhere.

23:46.704 --> 23:48.744
- Take Crabtree with you.
- I don't need a minder.

23:48.744 --> 23:51.521
- I was thinking more of a shield.
- Inspector!

23:51.552 --> 23:55.304
- It's a bloody joke, Crabtree.
- Ha bloody ha.

24:00.316 --> 24:03.073
I found a weighable quantity
of a crystal alkaloid

24:03.096 --> 24:06.038
in the victim's stomach. We
determined it to be strychnine,

24:06.057 --> 24:07.933
a total of three milligrams.

24:08.058 --> 24:10.494
- Enough to kill a person?
- Quite rapidly.

24:11.105 --> 24:13.762
Were any traces of
strychnine found in her lunch?

24:13.887 --> 24:16.451
Well, I found no evidence
of foreign substances

24:16.476 --> 24:19.806
beyond what appears to be
some bits of Prussian sausage.

24:20.253 --> 24:23.004
We did find a suspicious
colouration in the dregs

24:23.016 --> 24:25.736
of the Sister's teacup. We
were just about to test it.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.468
Oh. By all means, carry on.

24:28.488 --> 24:30.558
The alkaloid chromate that
I've made from the crystals

24:30.570 --> 24:32.302
have been placed in
this porcelain plate.

24:32.491 --> 24:35.053
Should I add the drop
of pure sulphuric acid?

24:35.084 --> 24:37.162
Yes, very good, Miss Hart.

24:40.492 --> 24:42.494
If this is strychnine, we
should see the substance

24:42.502 --> 24:44.125
turn into a rich blue colour,

24:44.169 --> 24:46.781
followed by purple and into cherry red.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.422
Well, there you have it.

24:53.435 --> 24:55.613
The victim's tea was
the source of the poison.

24:55.738 --> 24:58.182
And if the strychnine hat
killed Sister AnnaMaria

24:58.213 --> 24:59.742
was found in her tea...

24:59.867 --> 25:01.510
then it had to have been put there

25:01.517 --> 25:03.722
- by someone in this station.
- John?

25:04.526 --> 25:07.032
Was anyone standing nearby
you when you made the tea?

25:07.101 --> 25:08.981
No, no one was close to me.

25:08.983 --> 25:10.827
I waited by the pot and,

25:10.864 --> 25:12.118
once steeped and poured,

25:12.162 --> 25:14.410
I put the cup on the desk
nearest to the Sister.

25:14.863 --> 25:17.841
So any of our guests may
have had access to it.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.888
- They'll have to be placed under closer watch.
- Indeed.

25:21.013 --> 25:23.104
I've placed Constable on each of them.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.754
- You'd better get back out there, son.
- Sir.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.625
Which one of them did this, Murdoch?

25:38.709 --> 25:41.202
Henry, where's Eddie Crawford?

25:41.327 --> 25:42.921
He had to use the water closet.

25:43.046 --> 25:45.766
Go look in on him. He's
not to be left unattended.

25:45.772 --> 25:47.289
Sir.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.129
It has to be someone
in here, doesn't it?

25:51.406 --> 25:53.124
Well, we don't know for certain,

25:53.150 --> 25:55.808
- but we're taking every precaution.
- Sir!

25:56.007 --> 25:58.261
- Eddie went out the window.
- Bloody hell, Higgins!

25:58.280 --> 26:01.088
He's one of our suspects.
That makes him the primary one.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.335
Get out there and find him.

26:03.342 --> 26:04.921
- And bring him back immediately.
- Sir.

26:04.934 --> 26:06.438
Go!

26:19.080 --> 26:20.880
Not so fast, Eddie.

26:21.441 --> 26:24.230
I'm not going back to that place.

26:25.445 --> 26:27.112
I think you are.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.141
Gibson's body was found at the bottom.

26:38.621 --> 26:41.234
There's nowhere to hide out here.

26:41.359 --> 26:46.706
Our killer would have ad to wait
inside until Gibson was distracted

26:46.726 --> 26:49.822
perhaps lighting his cigarette

26:49.947 --> 26:52.560
and then stepped out
to give him a good push.

26:53.693 --> 26:55.934
- Simple but effective.
- Mm-hmm.

26:57.035 --> 26:58.547
Sir...

26:58.961 --> 27:01.315
are you not concerned
that you yourself are...

27:01.541 --> 27:04.563
- marked for death?
- I don't like it.

27:04.632 --> 27:09.213
But the truth is death could
come to any one of us any day.

27:09.338 --> 27:11.535
Still, no need to hurry it along.

27:11.834 --> 27:15.988
Well, very little of
life is under our control.

27:17.318 --> 27:19.576
Very little of death as well.

27:20.614 --> 27:22.628
Watts, have you ever been to Paris?

27:22.662 --> 27:25.099
Yes. The City of Light.

27:25.398 --> 27:28.057
- I thought that was Buffalo.
- No, I believe Paris

27:28.089 --> 27:30.150
came up with it first. Why do you ask?

27:30.275 --> 27:33.817
Nina's involved with a show
that's performing there.

27:33.942 --> 27:35.869
She wants me to go.

27:35.994 --> 27:38.728
- Forever?
- No, no, just a short while.

27:39.735 --> 27:45.060
Well, the world is only an
oyster if you choose to open it.

27:45.569 --> 27:46.962
So...

27:47.017 --> 27:50.908
go to Paris today, for
tomorrow I might die?

27:51.381 --> 27:52.591
Precisely.

27:54.138 --> 27:55.390
What about you?

27:55.730 --> 27:57.600
What would you do with your last day?

27:57.915 --> 27:59.199
Just this.

27:59.224 --> 28:01.762
- Talk to a friend.
- Who?

28:02.441 --> 28:04.171
Oh, me!

28:08.484 --> 28:10.776
And solve a crime.

28:11.071 --> 28:14.096
- This is what we're looking for.
- Brilliant.

28:16.260 --> 28:19.227
The City of Love with a beautiful woman.

28:19.352 --> 28:21.124
You'd be a fool to say no.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.322
I thought you said it
was the City of Light.

28:23.356 --> 28:27.215
Light. Love. Are they
not one and the same?

28:28.428 --> 28:30.494
I prefer to love with
the lights off, sir.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.792
- Hm.
- I fear I'm bashful.

28:39.924 --> 28:42.681
Issued by the Dominion
Bank on Jarvis Street.

28:43.544 --> 28:45.798
That connects Murray Gibson

28:45.842 --> 28:47.938
and Harrison McCallister,
the bank manager.

28:47.988 --> 28:50.128
Exactly. In fact, it reminds me

28:50.150 --> 28:52.571
of one of my old cases, a bank robbery.

28:52.628 --> 28:55.070
A customer was killed
and the man I brought in

28:55.140 --> 28:56.651
was hanged for the crime.

28:56.688 --> 28:58.892
This robbery was at the
Dominion Bank on Jarvis?

28:58.911 --> 29:01.398
Yes. We knew our suspect
pulled the trigger.

29:01.405 --> 29:04.299
We also knew he had an
accomplice who was never found.

29:04.424 --> 29:06.570
You believe that accomplice
to be Murray Gibson?

29:06.601 --> 29:09.874
Perhaps. This is the file on that case.

29:09.904 --> 29:12.442
The man I arrested was
named Joe Thackeray.

29:12.447 --> 29:14.373
He had previously been a bank teller.

29:15.156 --> 29:16.875
George, a word.

29:17.886 --> 29:18.977
Sir.

29:19.286 --> 29:23.042
George, you said Sister
AnnaMaria got a bank clerk fired.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.236
Do you recall which bank?

29:24.316 --> 29:25.535
Yes, it was the one she mentioned.

29:25.552 --> 29:27.182
The Dominion Bank on Jarvis.

29:27.227 --> 29:28.663
It's my branch as well.

29:29.715 --> 29:30.761
And the clerk?

29:31.165 --> 29:32.389
I don't know, sir.

29:33.518 --> 29:35.690
Could Joe Thackeray

29:36.012 --> 29:38.794
be the clerk that was
fired from the bank

29:38.813 --> 29:40.796
due to Sister AnnaMaria's complaint?

29:40.841 --> 29:44.936
Interesting. If so, what
seemed like a tenuous connection

29:44.951 --> 29:46.517
that the nun banked at the same bank

29:46.522 --> 29:48.467
managed by Mr. McCallister...

29:48.517 --> 29:50.592
might indeed be salient.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.159
What if the man you arrested

29:53.751 --> 29:56.665
was a disgruntled ex-bank employee

29:56.690 --> 30:00.554
that was fired by McCallister due
to Sister AnnaMaria's complaint?

30:00.679 --> 30:03.623
And a month later, robbed
a bank along with Gibson.

30:05.158 --> 30:07.526
So we just need to find out...

30:07.912 --> 30:10.429
if the others know this Joe Thackeray?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.801
You know, I never really thought
very highly of you, Eddie,

30:15.835 --> 30:18.691
but I didn't think you'd turn out
to be a bloody crackpot either.

30:18.721 --> 30:20.504
I never killed anyone.

30:20.554 --> 30:21.698
So why did you run?

30:21.728 --> 30:23.244
It seemed better than being dead.

30:23.274 --> 30:25.852
Or you were trying to escape
before we found proof it was you.

30:25.893 --> 30:28.396
Do either of you recognize
the name Joe Thackeray?

30:28.436 --> 30:29.438
Not me.

30:30.426 --> 30:32.878
That name means something
to you, Mr. Crawford.

30:34.797 --> 30:37.029
If you know something, you better
say it before you get us all killed.

30:37.049 --> 30:39.022
Shut your trap, why don't you?

30:39.088 --> 30:41.077
I don't know anyone named Thackeray.

30:41.087 --> 30:43.324
You're a weasel, just like always.

30:43.344 --> 30:44.356
"Always."

30:44.704 --> 30:46.511
So the two of you do know one another.

30:46.919 --> 30:48.817
And you both lied about it.

30:51.123 --> 30:52.523
He told me not to tell.

30:53.022 --> 30:55.237
Said it could get us both
into even more trouble.

30:55.362 --> 30:56.975
But I swear I don't
know what it has to do

30:56.980 --> 30:58.305
with someone called Thackeray.

30:58.592 --> 31:00.833
If you value your teeth,
Crawford, you better cough it up.

31:00.837 --> 31:04.041
- I barely knew the man, all right?
- Answer him!

31:05.290 --> 31:09.324
A man by that name came into the
shop with his rings and his watch.

31:09.354 --> 31:12.229
I gave him some cash and
sent him on his way. See?

31:12.265 --> 31:14.450
- We were hardly the best of pals.
- Right.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.127
Enough playing silly buggers.

31:16.252 --> 31:18.589
Oh. What have you got in here?

31:21.358 --> 31:23.192
What are you planning
to do with a gun, Eddie?

31:23.247 --> 31:25.815
Protect myself, if necessary.

31:25.890 --> 31:27.784
You didn't lie about knowing Thackeray

31:27.804 --> 31:29.531
because he pawned a few trinkets.

31:29.699 --> 31:30.921
What are you hiding?

31:31.046 --> 31:32.940
Tell the detective what
he wants to know, Eddie.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.468
- You stay out of this, Lenny.
- You shifty little...

31:35.483 --> 31:38.278
- Calm down, big fella.
- We fixed a fight! All right?

31:38.469 --> 31:40.518
Mr. Crawford had you throw a fight?

31:40.830 --> 31:43.575
- I didn't want to.
- You took the money, didn't you?

31:43.630 --> 31:46.461
What does this have to
do with Joe Thackeray?

31:47.806 --> 31:49.934
Thackeray was having money problems.

31:49.966 --> 31:51.880
I suggested he bet on the fight.

31:51.899 --> 31:53.428
I told him I had a fix in on it.

31:53.466 --> 31:55.556
You told Thackeray to bet against Lenny?

31:55.681 --> 31:59.941
Not really. I told him it was a
surefire thing that Lenny would win.

32:00.012 --> 32:02.576
So you cheated a desperate man
out of his last few dollars.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.555
I felt bad about it as well.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.876
That's why I tried
to help him out after.

32:06.886 --> 32:08.372
Oh yeah? What kind of help?

32:08.397 --> 32:11.680
I set him up with a
man who had a job to do.

32:12.929 --> 32:14.198
Murray Gibson?

32:14.540 --> 32:15.567
Yes.

32:15.879 --> 32:17.702
I knew Gibson wanted to rob a bank

32:17.733 --> 32:20.190
and was looking for
someone to do it with him.

32:20.361 --> 32:22.416
And Joe Thackeray fit the bill.

32:23.091 --> 32:24.385
Of course...

32:24.446 --> 32:26.138
that didn't end too well for Joe.

32:27.241 --> 32:29.976
So all roads lead to Joe Thackeray.

32:29.986 --> 32:31.718
He appears to be our lynchpin.

32:31.945 --> 32:34.448
Maybe, but he's not our killer,

32:35.031 --> 32:36.962
given that he's been
dead for six months.

32:37.521 --> 32:39.561
Each of our victims played a role

32:39.561 --> 32:41.706
in Joe's fall from grace.

32:42.935 --> 32:44.295
She complains,

32:45.463 --> 32:47.200
McCallister fires him.

32:47.265 --> 32:48.872
Crawford takes his money.

32:49.355 --> 32:51.209
With help from Stoker.

32:51.950 --> 32:54.004
Gibson joins him for the robbery.

32:54.447 --> 32:55.978
Gibson gets away with the money.

32:56.215 --> 32:57.958
And I arrest him.

32:58.230 --> 33:00.905
Every person here represents
a rung in the ladder

33:00.915 --> 33:03.614
of Joe's downward descent...

33:03.670 --> 33:05.245
Taking him straight to the gallows.

33:05.279 --> 33:06.757
Except for the little girl.

33:06.949 --> 33:09.482
Where does Agnes Swift
fit in to all of this?

33:14.670 --> 33:16.342
I know that man.

33:19.167 --> 33:20.714
He's my father.

33:31.617 --> 33:34.140
Joe Thackeray was Agnes's father?

33:34.780 --> 33:37.798
As I already told you, we
had little to do with him.

33:37.923 --> 33:39.909
He gave you money from time to time.

33:39.922 --> 33:41.554
Well, he was a decent enough fellow

33:41.574 --> 33:43.185
but we had nothing in common

33:43.310 --> 33:45.481
and no desire to share a life together.

33:45.870 --> 33:47.552
Still, he tried to
help out with Agnes...

33:47.557 --> 33:49.526
But then the money stopped coming.

33:49.783 --> 33:52.482
- That's right.
- And that placed you into hardship.

33:52.774 --> 33:54.023
Very much so.

33:54.068 --> 33:55.569
Is that some kind of crime?

33:55.584 --> 33:58.077
We asked if you knew anything
about the Dominion Bank.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.194
- You lied to us.
- No, I just wasn't thinking about Joe.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.376
You're the only person with a connection

34:03.386 --> 34:05.471
to each of the obituary subjects.

34:05.506 --> 34:08.396
But I knew nothing of any
of these people before today.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.797
Every one of these people played a part

34:10.822 --> 34:14.524
- in ending Joe Thackeray's life.
- And who was most harmed by that downfall?

34:14.801 --> 34:16.871
You, the mother of his child.

34:17.062 --> 34:19.802
You even included your own
daughter on the obituary list

34:19.811 --> 34:21.987
to get you into the
station, giving you access

34:21.993 --> 34:23.887
to the others you hadn't yet killed.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.377
That's absurd.

34:25.402 --> 34:27.139
Let's see what we've got in here.

34:29.995 --> 34:31.505
I'd wager...

34:31.777 --> 34:34.376
that this is the poison
that killed Sister AnnaMaria.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.597
I don't know what that is.

34:37.005 --> 34:39.885
That damned pawnbroker was
caught red handed at my handbag.

34:39.889 --> 34:41.702
It was him. It must be!

34:42.100 --> 34:44.342
Momma, can we go?

34:44.513 --> 34:46.870
We have to get to the
fair before it closes.

34:52.630 --> 34:53.723
What are you doing?

34:53.754 --> 34:56.331
Miss Swift, please
don't! Put the gun down.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.281
- Momma, don't.
- Come with me, Agnes.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.481
Please stop! You're hurting me.

35:00.606 --> 35:02.188
Agnes. Get over here.

35:02.490 --> 35:05.079
- Agnes! Right now!
- Give me that!

35:07.874 --> 35:09.697
Virginia Swift, you are under arrest

35:09.707 --> 35:11.989
for the murders of Harrison McCallister,

35:12.029 --> 35:14.200
Murray Gibson and Sister AnnaMaria.

35:14.270 --> 35:16.547
- Come with me, young lady.
- No!

35:29.418 --> 35:31.170
The people at the
orphanage can come for Agnes

35:31.185 --> 35:32.474
in a couple of hours.

35:32.540 --> 35:34.812
I've had Crabtree tell Lenny
and Eddie they're free to leave.

35:34.852 --> 35:36.896
Is there not a relative
who can take her?

35:37.450 --> 35:39.983
Miss Swift told us
there is no other family.

35:40.587 --> 35:42.164
The girl is now an orphan,

35:42.652 --> 35:44.842
and I'm the one who arrested her father.

35:44.967 --> 35:47.366
Thackeray made the decision
to walk into that bank

35:47.381 --> 35:49.330
and use his weapon, not you.

35:49.455 --> 35:51.266
He took his own chances
when he threw his lot in

35:51.282 --> 35:52.305
with the likes of Gibson.

35:52.329 --> 35:53.779
And he suffered the consequences.

35:54.098 --> 35:55.903
Now, so will the child.

35:56.365 --> 35:57.870
Before the orphanage takes her,

35:57.885 --> 36:00.076
perhaps she and I could go to the fair.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.713
She seemed so set on it.

36:02.654 --> 36:05.504
It might be a way to distract
her from all that's happened.

36:05.629 --> 36:08.536
No one here holds you
responsible, Detective.

36:09.861 --> 36:10.944
Still.

36:11.416 --> 36:13.184
I know how she must be feeling.

36:16.784 --> 36:18.396
Hello young Miss.

36:18.521 --> 36:19.594
Hello.

36:20.043 --> 36:23.146
I heard you mention the
fair a number of times today.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.051
It's at the park. It's the last day.

36:26.176 --> 36:29.029
Well, perhaps would
you like it if we went?

36:29.063 --> 36:30.326
We can go?

36:30.552 --> 36:31.826
Would you take me?

36:32.591 --> 36:33.941
I don't see why not.

36:41.154 --> 36:43.944
Older children are far
less likely to be adopted,

36:43.989 --> 36:46.436
or to adjust well to a new family.

36:47.096 --> 36:50.056
William, if we're
successful in our endeavors,

36:50.071 --> 36:52.680
we must be sure to
choose good godparents.

36:53.300 --> 36:54.886
Do you have someone in mind?

36:55.294 --> 36:57.632
Detective! Doctor!

37:00.421 --> 37:02.083
I went into the inspector's office

37:02.108 --> 37:04.420
to retrieve the vial from
Virginia Swift's handbag.

37:04.484 --> 37:07.410
Yes, that should go along to the morgue.

37:07.748 --> 37:09.535
Oh, yes, I can take that now.

37:09.571 --> 37:10.709
That's just the thing.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.541
The entire contents of
the bag was dumped out.

37:12.582 --> 37:13.962
The vial of poison is gone.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.244
Who else had opportunity to take it?

37:17.859 --> 37:19.199
Mr. Crawford?

37:19.324 --> 37:22.135
- Mr. Stoker?
- Either one, I suppose.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.559
But that doesn't make any sense.

37:23.615 --> 37:25.146
Neither have reason to kill.

37:25.171 --> 37:27.548
Could you have been
mistaken about Miss Swift?

37:28.470 --> 37:29.709
I don't know...

37:30.182 --> 37:33.344
Momma, can we go?

37:34.457 --> 37:37.337
We have to get to the fair
at the park before it closes.

37:54.281 --> 37:55.842
She knew it was her daughter.

37:56.220 --> 37:57.292
William?

37:57.651 --> 37:59.146
Virginia Swift

37:59.408 --> 38:02.128
wasn't trying to take
her daughter hostage.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.664
She was protecting her.

38:04.097 --> 38:07.527
- You don't mean...
- The girl wrote the obituaries.

38:07.561 --> 38:09.189
Agnes is the murderer.

38:09.215 --> 38:10.614
She's got the poison.

38:10.695 --> 38:13.032
And she's at the fair
right now with the man

38:13.042 --> 38:14.653
who arrested her father.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.695
Thank you for taking me, Mr. Watts.

38:26.750 --> 38:27.983
It's the least I could do.

38:28.059 --> 38:30.375
You're going to make
a very bad day better.

39:05.954 --> 39:09.053
I'm going to say... 55 pounds.

39:09.078 --> 39:10.627
All right, then.

39:13.113 --> 39:14.718
Tada!

39:16.157 --> 39:19.187
- How can he do that?
- Well, he's an expert.

39:19.312 --> 39:20.930
- There you go.
- Thank you.

39:22.497 --> 39:24.127
Whoa!

39:24.252 --> 39:26.412
Momma always says I'm
just skin and bone.

39:26.437 --> 39:27.948
Mm.

39:28.338 --> 39:30.485
Do you know what's going
to happen to my mother?

39:30.610 --> 39:32.859
It will depend on the court findings.

39:33.041 --> 39:35.213
But what she's done is very serious.

39:35.446 --> 39:38.159
Will she be hanged, like my papa?

39:38.284 --> 39:40.073
I don't know.

39:40.973 --> 39:43.227
Did you know your father well?

39:43.921 --> 39:46.154
He wrote letters from his jail cell.

39:46.657 --> 39:48.155
Lots of letters.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.214
He said he loved me very much.

39:51.455 --> 39:54.011
It must be comforting
for you to know that.

39:54.136 --> 39:55.484
It is.

39:56.075 --> 39:58.435
He told me all the things
that happened to him.

39:59.828 --> 40:02.749
He said he was just a man trying
to do his best for his daughter.

40:22.353 --> 40:23.720
He said how scared he was,

40:23.764 --> 40:25.684
knowing he was going to be hanged.

40:26.364 --> 40:29.713
He asked me to pray for him and
think of him waiting in his cell.

40:29.737 --> 40:33.151
And even after he was gone. So I do.

40:33.471 --> 40:36.039
I think of him every single day.

40:53.209 --> 40:55.555
Have you ever tried one of those?

40:56.098 --> 40:57.640
Can we?

40:57.672 --> 40:59.253
We must.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.548
Two please.

41:13.201 --> 41:16.138
- There we are. That's for you.
- Thank you.

41:19.618 --> 41:20.776
Thank you.

41:27.161 --> 41:28.475
Thank you.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.300
You first.

41:33.733 --> 41:35.953
Watts! Watts!

41:36.512 --> 41:37.605
No!

41:56.392 --> 41:57.979
I've had enough company in my station

41:58.019 --> 42:00.074
to last a lifetime, Crabtree. Out.

42:00.497 --> 42:02.184
What's gonna happen to the girl, sir?

42:03.155 --> 42:06.389
We don't hang children.
We send them to an asylum,

42:06.697 --> 42:08.347
where most of them belong anyway.

42:08.735 --> 42:09.792
I see.

42:11.969 --> 42:14.431
Well, get to it and don't
beat around the bush.

42:14.476 --> 42:15.775
Sir, I'll get straight to the point.

42:16.258 --> 42:18.111
How many years have I been working here?

42:18.368 --> 42:20.045
More than I care to remember.

42:20.075 --> 42:22.280
Well it has been a good many
years. And in all that time,

42:22.300 --> 42:24.109
what is the one thing
I've never asked for?

42:24.234 --> 42:27.140
One thing that any a
man, any good employee,

42:27.151 --> 42:30.153
- certainly deserves?
- You're not getting a bloody raise.

42:30.278 --> 42:32.121
That's not what I was gonna ask, sir.

42:32.358 --> 42:34.287
- Although now that you mention it...
- To the point.

42:34.412 --> 42:37.093
Sir, I would like some time off

42:37.454 --> 42:38.879
to visit Paris

42:38.899 --> 42:40.354
with Miss Bloom.

42:41.401 --> 42:42.987
Oh, you lucky sod.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.311
- Sir?
- You should go even if I say no.

42:46.436 --> 42:48.885
Sir, I didn't think you
thought much of the French.

42:49.177 --> 42:50.345
I don't...

42:50.617 --> 42:53.843
but that city has certainly
treated me well in the past.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.841
There was this one
particular young woman...

42:57.430 --> 42:58.848
Celine.

42:59.066 --> 43:00.723
Her name meant heaven.

43:01.785 --> 43:03.687
Oh, and by God, Crabtree,

43:04.479 --> 43:07.620
she took me to heaven and
back on numerous occasions.

43:08.675 --> 43:11.311
And she wasn't the only one
I made good acquaintance with.

43:11.821 --> 43:13.798
The Frenchmen I couldn't
give a toss about,

43:13.817 --> 43:17.053
but the women... ooh, la la.

43:17.334 --> 43:19.943
Sir, I would be travelling with a woman.

43:21.649 --> 43:24.054
The city will transform
her into a tiger.

43:24.136 --> 43:26.608
- Really?
- Go and get on that boat, Crabtree.

43:27.071 --> 43:30.636
I'm sure Station House Number 4
will persevere in your absence.

43:30.994 --> 43:32.565
Well, thank you sir.

43:33.239 --> 43:35.994
Dans mon coeur toujours, Celine.

43:36.954 --> 43:38.487
And to you.
