WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.203 --> 00:05.036
SUSAN MADE A DECISION.

00:05.036 --> 00:06.077
I'M GONNA SELL THIS HOUSE

00:06.077 --> 00:07.038
AND MOVE BACK UP THERE
WITH YOU

00:07.038 --> 00:09.040
AND HELP RAISE THE BABY.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.442
KAREN'S HEALTH TOOK A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.

00:11.442 --> 00:14.045
LOOKS LIKE THE CANCER'S
SPREADING FASTER

00:14.045 --> 00:15.386
THAN ANYONE THOUGHT.

00:15.386 --> 00:17.648
BEN WAS SUMMONED
BEFORE THE COURT.

00:17.648 --> 00:19.690
YOU'RE ON A WITNESS LIST
FOR BREE'S TRIAL?

00:19.690 --> 00:22.323
BREE'S FRIENDS CAUTIONED HER.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.794
YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON YOUR LAWYER.

00:23.794 --> 00:26.097
YOU'RE ON TRIAL FOR MURDER,
BREE.

00:26.097 --> 00:27.628
YOU GOTTA KEEP
A CLEAR HEAD.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.030
AND SO DOES HE.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.304
LYNETTE ENDED HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH TOM'S BOSS.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.666
SHE DUMPED ME. APPARENTLY SHE'S
HUNG UP ON SOME OTHER GUY.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.668
AND THIS LED...

00:37.668 --> 00:40.471
YOU REALLY SUCK
AT THIS GAY FRIEND THING.

00:40.471 --> 00:42.643
I CAN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY
IN THAT DRESS.

00:42.643 --> 00:46.117
TO AN UNFORTUNATE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

00:53.084 --> 00:56.127
(Mary Alice) KAREN McCLUSKEY
HAD NEVER BEEN SURE

00:56.127 --> 00:59.430
WHAT HER NEIGHBORS THOUGHT
OF HER.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.795
DID THEY SEE HER
AS MERELY A BABYSITTER...

01:04.795 --> 01:10.701
AN ENTERTAINING SOURCE
FOR GOSSIP...

01:10.701 --> 01:15.676
OR JUST THE MEAN OLD LADY
WHO LIVED DOWN THE STREET?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.780
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HER LIFE,

01:19.780 --> 01:24.615
SHE FOUND HERSELF THINKING
ABOUT SUCH THINGS...

01:24.615 --> 01:29.089
BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT HER LIFE

01:29.089 --> 01:31.292
WAS COMING TO AN END.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.294
ROY, IT'S TIME TO GO!

01:35.366 --> 01:37.198
WHAT'S GOING ON, KAREN?

01:37.198 --> 01:41.532
(voice breaks) I'M, UH,
STARTING HOSPICE CARE.

01:41.532 --> 01:44.335
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD THE DOCTORS
THAT YOU WANTED TO...

01:44.335 --> 01:47.107
CROAK AT HOME? YEAH, I DID.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.281
BUT THE ONCOLOGIST IS CONVINCED
THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

01:50.281 --> 01:52.112
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

01:52.112 --> 01:55.646
YOUNG QUACK THINKS
I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF WIFE.

01:55.646 --> 01:57.448
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU, ROY.

01:57.448 --> 01:59.750
YOU'VE GOT
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, ANGINA.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.252
I'M RACING YOU TO THE GRAVE
AS IT IS.

02:01.252 --> 02:03.123
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOU IN.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.897
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN
MY TIME WITH YOU,

02:06.897 --> 02:09.800
AND THOSE BASTARDS
ARE ROBBING ME OF IT.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.532
I KNOW.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.164
HANG ON.

02:13.164 --> 02:15.306
KAREN...

02:15.306 --> 02:17.208
WOULD YOU PREFER
TO DIE AT HOME?

02:17.208 --> 02:18.539
WELL, SURE, BUT--

02:18.539 --> 02:20.171
THEN...

02:22.473 --> 02:23.744
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.278
YEAH. WE CAN DO IT.

02:27.278 --> 02:29.250
WE'LL TAKE SHIFTS.
IT WON'T BE HARD.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.221
WHOA, NELLY.

02:30.221 --> 02:32.653
NO, THIS IS SWEET,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.785
BUT YOU GALS HAVE TROUBLES
OF YOUR OWN.

02:34.785 --> 02:36.827
BREE'S GOT HER TRIAL.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.829
LYNETTE'S MARRIAGE
IS FALLING APART.

02:38.829 --> 02:41.192
GABY, THOSE KIDS OF YOURS
ARE TURNING INTO SERIAL KILLERS

02:41.192 --> 02:42.833
BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.795
OKAY, I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SICK...

02:44.795 --> 02:46.797
AND TOTALLY CORRECT.

02:46.797 --> 02:49.900
BUT I'M WITH THE GIRLS ON THIS.
LET US TAKE CARE OF YOU.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.773
I'M GONNA REQUIRE A LOT OF CARE,
YOU KNOW.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.207
WE KNOW, AND WE'RE GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOU.

02:57.748 --> 03:00.611
HEY, BOY NURSES!

03:00.611 --> 03:03.814
BRING THE STUFF BACK
IN THE HOUSE! SHE'S STAYING.

03:03.814 --> 03:06.186
COME ON. LET'S GO HELP.
 (Gaby chuckles) OKAY.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.260
I'M... ACTUALLY SPEECHLESS.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.591
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE ALL DOING THIS.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.224
DON'T YOU?

03:13.224 --> 03:16.527
YES, MRS. McCLUSKEY
HAD WONDERED

03:16.527 --> 03:19.330
WHAT HER NEIGHBORS THOUGHT
OF HER.

03:19.330 --> 03:22.333
SHE WAS PLEASED TO DISCOVER
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

03:22.333 --> 03:36.717
THEY THOUGHT OF HER
AS A FRIEND.

03:36.717 --> 03:41.322
THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW
HAD BEEN ROCKED BY SCANDAL.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.954
A HOUSEWIFE HAD BEEN ACCUSED
OF MURDER,

03:43.954 --> 03:48.228
AND HER TRIAL WAS GROWING
MORE SENSATIONAL EACH DAY.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.763
IT TRULY WAS
ALL ANYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT...

03:52.763 --> 03:55.836
(camera shutter clicks)
 WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT ANOTHER HOUSEWIFE

03:55.836 --> 03:58.369
WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

03:58.369 --> 04:00.641
(Carlos) GABY!

04:03.274 --> 04:04.244
(door opens)

04:04.244 --> 04:06.517
(closes door)
 AH, THERE YOU ARE.

04:06.517 --> 04:08.018
YEP, JUST SITTING HERE
ON THE PORCH,

04:08.018 --> 04:09.850
READING THE OL'...

04:09.850 --> 04:11.852
SPORTS SECTION.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.285
YOU HATE SPORTS...

04:14.285 --> 04:15.986
AND READING.

04:15.986 --> 04:17.827
BUT I LOVE YOU,
AND YOU LOVE SPORTS,

04:17.827 --> 04:21.832
SO I'VE... STARTED
TO REALLY GET INTO IT.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.263
REALLY?

04:23.263 --> 04:26.497
WHAT'S YOUR... FAVORITE
BASKETBALL TEAM?

04:28.038 --> 04:29.840
THE... TURTLES.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.878
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.780
IT'S NOTHING.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.282
YOU SAID THE TRIAL WAS
GOING WELL.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.714
IT WAS. IT IS!
THIS IS JUST A SETBACK.

04:43.714 --> 04:46.557
DAMN IT! HOW--GABY, HOW MANY
SETBACKS IS IT GONNA TAKE

04:46.557 --> 04:49.520
BEFORE BREE GOES TO PRISON
FOR SOMETHING I DID?!

04:49.520 --> 04:52.363
HEY, LEE! SPORTS TALK.

04:52.363 --> 04:54.325
GETTIN' A LITTLE HEATED
OVER HERE! (chuckles)

04:58.329 --> 05:01.672
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE, GABY.
I HAVE GOT TO STEP UP.

05:01.672 --> 05:02.773
ARE YOU CRAZY? NO!

05:02.773 --> 05:05.336
HOW DO YOU NOT
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THIS?

05:05.336 --> 05:07.538
I DO, EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY.

05:07.538 --> 05:09.680
WE JUST HAVE TO HOLD ON
A LITTLE LONGER.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.941
BREE SAYS TRIP KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING,

05:10.941 --> 05:12.943
SO WE'VE JUST GOTTA
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

05:12.943 --> 05:14.314
YEAH, I-I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN--

05:14.314 --> 05:16.487
TURNING YOURSELF IN NOW
WOULD JUST BE FOOLISH.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.419
YOU'D BE THROWING
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AWAY,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.320
ABANDONING OUR FAMILY.
AND FOR WHAT?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.394
TO PROVE A POINT ABOUT
WHAT AN HONORABLE GUY YOU ARE?

05:23.394 --> 05:25.796
PLEASE, LET'S JUST SEE
HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.

05:25.796 --> 05:27.858
OKAY.
 (sighs)

05:27.858 --> 05:29.860
BUT IF THINGS GET ANY WORSE,
I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.362
(smacks newspaper)

05:33.964 --> 05:35.366
(sighs deeply)

05:38.769 --> 05:40.371
LEE! NO!

05:40.371 --> 05:41.542
WHAT?

05:41.542 --> 05:42.873
(lowered voice) STOP!

05:42.873 --> 05:44.415
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

05:44.415 --> 05:46.417
OH! NO. I STILL WANNA SELL.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.419
THANK GOD, 'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY
SPENT MY COMMISSION.

05:48.419 --> 05:49.880
ON WHAT?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.652
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.484
I HAD SOME
PERSONAL RENOVATIONS DONE.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.857
(whispers) AHH.

05:58.429 --> 06:00.661
MY ASS!
I HAD MY ASS LIFTED.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.533
OH!

06:02.533 --> 06:04.795
UM... OF COURSE.

06:04.795 --> 06:06.767
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.569
THAT IS ONE...

06:08.569 --> 06:09.800
PERKY FANNY.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.472
(chuckles)

06:11.472 --> 06:14.505
I'M SORRY. I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD
WITH ASS COMPLIMENTS.

06:14.505 --> 06:16.477
SO WHY DON'T YOU WANT
THE SIGN UP?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.609
WELL... (sighs)

06:18.609 --> 06:21.512
I HAVEN'T TOLD THE GIRLS
I'M MOVING YET.

06:21.512 --> 06:22.683
WHY NOT?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.384
I DON'T KNOW. (sighs)

06:24.384 --> 06:27.488
MAYBE BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN
BELIEVE I'M DOING IT MYSELF.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.859
IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO MOVE.

06:28.859 --> 06:30.461
YEAH.

06:30.461 --> 06:33.393
PUTTING MY HOUSE ON THE MARKET
IN THE MIDDLE OF BREE'S TRIAL?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.025
I MEAN, I JUST FEEL LIKE
A BAD PERSON.

06:35.025 --> 06:37.568
OKAY, THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FRIEND

06:37.568 --> 06:39.770
SHOWS THAT YOU'RE NOT
A BAD PERSON.

06:39.770 --> 06:40.931
(sighs)

06:40.931 --> 06:42.473
BY THE WAY,
IF BREE GETS CONVICTED,

06:42.473 --> 06:44.134
DO YOU THINK SHE'LL
PUT HER PLACE ON THE MARKET?

06:44.134 --> 06:45.175
LEE!

06:45.175 --> 06:46.537
AND IF LYNETTE GETS DIVORCED,

06:46.537 --> 06:48.008
THAT HOUSE IS GONNA BE
WAY TOO BIG FOR HER.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.179
(smack)

06:49.179 --> 06:51.181
WOW! I...

06:51.181 --> 06:53.584
IT KINDA SMACKED ME BACK.

06:58.649 --> 07:01.852
(cell phone rings)

07:01.852 --> 07:03.023
(ring)

07:03.023 --> 07:04.555
(grunts)
 (beep)

07:04.555 --> 07:05.626
HELLO?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.458
(lowered voice)
SHE'S GONE.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.600
HEY, PENNY! WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE ARE YA?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.463
DAD'S. DID YOU HEAR ME?
JANE'S GONE.

07:12.463 --> 07:15.435
WHOA. WHOA.
SHE'S "GONE" MEANING...

07:15.435 --> 07:16.637
SHE'S NOT THERE RIGHT NOW?

07:16.637 --> 07:19.439
OR--OR SHE'S GONE GONE?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.572
Her stuff is moved out.

07:21.572 --> 07:24.575
EVEN HER TOOTHBRUSH, MOM!

07:24.575 --> 07:25.946
THEY BROKE UP!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.618
OH, MY...

07:27.618 --> 07:29.179
HANG ON.

07:29.179 --> 07:31.552
(gasps)
YOUR DAD'S ON THE OTHER LINE!

07:31.552 --> 07:32.583
Call me back!

07:32.583 --> 07:33.624
OKAY! STAY CALM!

07:33.624 --> 07:34.785
I am.

07:34.785 --> 07:36.757
I WAS TALKING TO ME!
 (beep)

07:36.757 --> 07:38.458
HEY, TOM. WHAT'S UP?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.661
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA
BE AROUND TONIGHT?

07:40.661 --> 07:44.164
UH... I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE. PROBABLY.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.496
YEAH. WHY?

07:45.496 --> 07:46.997
UM, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING,

07:46.997 --> 07:48.969
AND I'D--I'D LIKE TO DO IT
FACE-TO-FACE.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.101
OH, OKAY. WHAT TIME?

07:51.101 --> 07:52.503
(sighs) HOW ABOUT 8:00?

07:52.503 --> 07:54.645
8:00?
8:00 IS MY FAVORITE TIME.

07:54.645 --> 07:55.806
WHAT? WHY?

07:55.806 --> 07:57.748
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST... ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

07:57.748 --> 08:01.912
YOU KNOW, EIGHT IS GREAT.

08:01.912 --> 08:03.914
YOU OKAY?
 Uh, me? Oh, yeah.
I'm just...

08:03.914 --> 08:05.916
(bang)
 cleaning the oven and...

08:05.916 --> 08:07.618
(clatters)
 THE FUMES ARE GETTING TO ME,

08:07.618 --> 08:09.920
AND I'M DRUNK... A LITTLE.
(laughs nervously)

08:09.920 --> 08:11.722
So I'll see you tonight?

08:11.722 --> 08:13.894
O-OKAY. BYE.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.626
OKAY. BYE! (chuckles)
 (beep)

08:15.626 --> 08:16.727
(high-pitched voice) YEAH!

08:16.727 --> 08:19.129
(chuckles)

08:19.129 --> 08:22.132
(indistinct conversations)

08:25.876 --> 08:27.107
THANK YOU.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.979
YEAH, MM. DON'T THANK ME
JUST YET.

08:28.979 --> 08:30.280
MM.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.643
BREE...

08:32.643 --> 08:35.184
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
BEN IS GONNA TESTIFY ABOUT,

08:35.184 --> 08:36.515
BUT IF IT'S AS DAMNING

08:36.515 --> 08:38.589
AS THE PROSECUTION SEEMS
TO THINK IT IS--

08:38.589 --> 08:40.020
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT BEN.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.523
IF HIS TESTIMONY IS DAMAGING
IN ANY WAY,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.296
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUT GABY
BACK ON THE STAND.
 NO.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.163
(lowered voice) THE DEAD GUY
WAS HER STEPFATHER.

08:53.163 --> 08:55.666
SHE HAS SOME CONNECTION
TO THIS.

08:55.666 --> 08:56.967
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.939
(whispering) I'M THE CLIENT.
YOU'RE THE LAWYER.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.010
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.

09:00.010 --> 09:01.541
IT'S YOUR CALL.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.673
BUT I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU'RE FORCING ME

09:02.673 --> 09:04.715
TO TRY THIS THING WITH ONE HAND
TIED BEHIND MY BACK.

09:04.715 --> 09:07.147
WELL, LUCKILY, YOU HAVE
MORE TALENT IN THAT ONE HAND

09:07.147 --> 09:09.880
THAN MOST LAWYERS HAVE
IN THEIR WHOLE BODY.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.682
YOU CAN DO THIS.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.754
I KNOW YOU CAN.

09:17.658 --> 09:21.632
MR. FAULKNER,
I AM ORDERING YOU TO ANSWER.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.563
MS. STONE, REPEAT YOUR QUESTION.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.697
DURING YOUR PHONE CONVERSATION
WITH THE DEFENDANT,

09:26.697 --> 09:29.169
SHE THANKED YOU
FOR PROTECTING HER.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.701
WHAT WAS SHE REFERRING TO?

09:30.701 --> 09:34.344
I'M SORRY. I REALLY DON'T
REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.947
MAYBE THIS WILL REFRESH
YOUR MEMORY.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.711
YOUR HONOR?
 GO AHEAD.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.713
MM.

09:42.713 --> 09:45.585
(Bree) I know, but even when
suspicion moved on to you,

09:45.585 --> 09:48.018
you still protected me,
and that's very honorable.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.219
(Ben) Really,
it was no big deal.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.661
Maybe not to you.

09:50.661 --> 09:53.263
You're not the one
who put a body in the ground.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.225
You have to understand,
a day doesn't go by

09:55.225 --> 09:58.729
when that does not
weigh heavily on my conscience.

09:58.729 --> 09:59.900
(click)

09:59.900 --> 10:01.902
SO...

10:01.902 --> 10:04.334
WHAT WERE YOU
PROTECTING HER FROM?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.709
AGAIN, SIR,

10:08.709 --> 10:11.842
I'M ORDERING YOU TO ANSWER
THE PROSECUTOR'S QUESTIONS.

10:13.243 --> 10:17.287
ALL RIGHT. I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
YOU'RE IN CONTEMPT.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.650
BAILIFF, TAKE MR. FAULKNER
INTO CUSTODY.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.652
PERHAPS A NIGHT IN JAIL

10:21.652 --> 10:23.724
WILL HELP HIM TO SEE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.925
CAN I AT LEAST MAKE A CALL?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.758
ONE CALL. WE'RE IN RECESS.

10:27.758 --> 10:29.359
(bangs gavel)

10:29.359 --> 10:31.932
(lowered voice)
SO THEY'RE ARRESTING HIM?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.133
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.264
THEY'LL BRING HIM BACK
TOMORROW.

10:34.264 --> 10:36.807
THE D.A. WILL ASK
THE SAME QUESTION AGAIN.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.638
AND WHAT IF
HE STILL DOESN'T ANSWER?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.672
FRANKLY, BREE,
I'M MORE WORRIED IF HE DOES.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.224
(shifts gears)

10:54.224 --> 10:55.385
(turns off engine)

10:55.385 --> 10:56.727
(gasps)

10:56.727 --> 10:58.889
OH!

10:58.889 --> 11:02.092
OH, MY GOODNESS, RENEE.
YOU STARTLED ME.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.964
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.665
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.699
I JUST GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM BEN. HE'S IN JAIL.

11:08.699 --> 11:12.342
I KNOW. I AM DEEPLY SORRY
FOR THIS WHOLE MESS.

11:12.342 --> 11:14.304
DO YOU WANNA COME INSIDE?

11:14.304 --> 11:17.147
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR TEA AND BISCUITS.

11:17.147 --> 11:18.809
BEN AND I ARE
GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK,

11:18.809 --> 11:22.212
AND "CORRECTIONAL FACILITY"
ISN'T EXACTLY MY DREAM VENUE.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.014
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.185
THERE IS.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.287
BEN IS SITTING
IN THAT JAIL CELL RIGHT NOW,

11:27.287 --> 11:30.120
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY,
AND HE WON'T TELL ME.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.292
SO YOU HAVE TO FIX THIS.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.365
JUST RELEASE HIM FROM
WHATEVER PROMISE HE MADE YOU.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.998
BELIEVE ME, I WISH I COULD
DO THAT, BUT I CAN'T.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.099
WHY NOT?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.402
I JUST CAN'T.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.774
BREE... (sighs)

11:43.774 --> 11:46.236
DID YOU... KILL THAT MAN?

11:46.236 --> 11:49.379
OF COURSE NOT.
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?

11:49.379 --> 11:51.011
(sighs)

11:51.011 --> 11:54.314
I'LL APOLOGIZE WHEN SOMEONE
STARTS TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.946
(sighs)

11:58.318 --> 12:01.752
OKAY, LET'S GET THOSE LIPS
A LITTLE MORE GLOSSY.

12:01.752 --> 12:03.193
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
I'M MEETING WITH TOM,

12:03.193 --> 12:05.926
NOT PREPPING FOR A SHIFT
AT A BORDELLO.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.257
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE FINALLY
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

12:07.257 --> 12:08.829
YOU'VE GOTTA LOOK PERFECT.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.130
(both chuckle)

12:10.130 --> 12:12.262
OH! AND WE STILL HAVE TIME
FOR THAT BRAZILIAN BIKINI WAX.

12:12.262 --> 12:14.134
IF YOU MENTION THAT AGAIN,
I WILL STRIKE YOU.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.366
(car door slams)

12:16.366 --> 12:18.909
WHAT THE HELL?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.143
(gasps, whispers) IT'S TOM!

12:23.143 --> 12:25.015
YOU SAID 8:00!

12:25.015 --> 12:26.176
HE SAID 8:00!

12:26.176 --> 12:27.878
I NEED TO BE ALONE WITH HIM.
YOU HAVE TO HIDE!

12:27.878 --> 12:28.979
HIDE?!

12:28.979 --> 12:30.150
YES!

12:30.150 --> 12:31.281
WHAT IF YOU GUYS START
DOING IT RIGHT HERE?

12:31.281 --> 12:33.353
I CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT!
WELL, MAYBE I COULD.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.085
HIDE! HIDE! PUT YOUR FINGERS
IN YOUR EARS! GO ON!

12:35.085 --> 12:36.987
OH!

12:38.228 --> 12:40.290
HEY. (giggles)
YOU'RE EARLY.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.192
YEAH. SORRY.

12:42.192 --> 12:43.433
YOU--YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

12:43.433 --> 12:46.166
NO. NO, I WAS JUST...

12:46.166 --> 12:47.167
NO.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.170
IT'S FINE, LYNETTE.
I UNDERSTAND. Y-YOU...

12:50.170 --> 12:51.501
YOU GOT A LIFE. (chuckles)

12:51.501 --> 12:54.104
(laughs) NO.
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

12:54.104 --> 12:56.006
COME ON IN. YOU WANT A DRINK
OR SOMETHING?

12:56.006 --> 12:58.008
NO, THANKS.
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

12:58.008 --> 12:59.810
COME IN.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.552
TOM?

13:05.455 --> 13:08.188
I'M FILING THE DIVORCE PAPERS
TOMORROW.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.364
YOU'RE... WHAT?

13:14.364 --> 13:16.867
WE JUST GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS GRAY AREA

13:16.867 --> 13:18.929
THAT WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN.

13:18.929 --> 13:21.471
IT'S... TIME

13:21.471 --> 13:24.404
FOR BOTH OF US
TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.940
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU IN PERSON.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.186
THAT'S ALL
I REALLY HAVE TO SAY.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.258
AREN'T YOU GOING AFTER HIM?

13:48.258 --> 13:49.499
WHY NOT?

13:49.499 --> 13:52.502
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW.

13:53.603 --> 13:57.337
JANE WASN'T THE PROBLEM.
IT'S ME.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.569
(whispers) HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE MARRIED TO ME.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.221
(door opens)

14:13.383 --> 14:15.285
(door closes)

14:15.285 --> 14:20.160
I GUESS WE CAN BOTH AGREE...

14:20.160 --> 14:21.892
ORANGE IS NOT MY COLOR.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.165
LOOK... (sighs)

14:25.165 --> 14:27.637
I'M SORRY I MISSED
THE CAKE TASTING, SWEETHEART.

14:27.637 --> 14:30.901
UH... I MEAN, DID YOU MAYBE
BRING ONE OF THEM WITH YOU?

14:30.901 --> 14:33.073
MM, PREFERABLY
WITH A FILE IN IT.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.275
REALLY? YOU'RE MAKING JOKES?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.307
HANG IN THERE, DARLING.

14:37.307 --> 14:38.478
THE TRIAL
CAN'T LAST FOREVER.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.250
THEY GOTTA LET ME
OUT OF HERE SOME TIME.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.253
OR YOU COULD ANSWER
THEIR QUESTIONS AND GET OUT NOW.

14:43.253 --> 14:45.155
YEAH.

14:45.155 --> 14:46.186
THAT'S NOT HOW I'M BUILT.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.888
BEN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG THIS COULD GO ON.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.191
AM I GONNA NEED
TO CANCEL OUR WEDDING?

14:51.191 --> 14:54.294
NO! THEY GOT NO MOTIVE,
NO WEAPON.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.196
AND BREE'S ALIBI IS SOLID.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.427
SHE WAS WITH ALL OF YOU

14:57.427 --> 14:59.299
AT THAT--
THAT PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.973
WAIT. THAT WAS THE NIGHT
OF THE MURDER?

15:02.973 --> 15:04.274
YEAH. WHY?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.477
OH, MY GOD.

15:07.477 --> 15:09.039
RENEE, WHAT IS IT?

15:09.039 --> 15:10.310
(sighs)

15:10.310 --> 15:12.212
UM...

15:12.212 --> 15:16.286
I REMEMBER SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.348
I WAS LOOKING OUT MY WINDOW,

15:18.348 --> 15:20.991
AND IT WAS LATE.

15:20.991 --> 15:24.924
AND I SAW BREE
GETTING OUT OF HER CAR.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.403
ENJOY YOUR VISIT,
MS. PERRY?

15:34.604 --> 15:36.206
I'M SORRY. DO I KNOW YOU?

15:36.206 --> 15:37.407
EMILY STONE.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.469
I'M THE PROSECUTOR
IN BREE VAN DE KAMP'S CASE.

15:39.469 --> 15:42.242
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.673
OH, I THINK YOU DO.

15:43.673 --> 15:46.276
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

15:48.248 --> 15:52.022
BACK THERE, WHEN YOU WERE
TALKING TO YOUR FIANCE,

15:52.022 --> 15:53.523
WE HEARD EVERY WORD.

15:53.523 --> 15:55.025
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

15:55.025 --> 15:58.288
THERE'S NO EXPECTATION
OF PRIVACY IN JAIL.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.959
SO... LET'S TALK.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.292
I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU TRY
TO CONVICT MY FRIEND.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.595
THAT'S A SHAME,
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

16:05.595 --> 16:07.297
I CALL IMMIGRATION,

16:07.297 --> 16:09.669
AND MR. FAULKNER'S ON
A ONE-WAY FLIGHT BACK TO SYDNEY.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.103
READY TO TALK NOW?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.351
MR. FAULKNER,

16:21.351 --> 16:23.083
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.455
OH, GOOD. YEAH, REFRESHED.

16:25.455 --> 16:29.089
I ASKED YOU YESTERDAY
IF YOU WERE WILLING TO DISCUSS

16:29.089 --> 16:31.721
YOUR TELEPHONE CONVERSATION
WITH THE DEFENDANT.

16:31.721 --> 16:34.224
I REMEMBER.

16:34.224 --> 16:35.225
STILL WON'T ANSWER.

16:35.225 --> 16:38.098
UH, CAN WE JUST
SAVE EVERYONE SOME TIME

16:38.098 --> 16:39.769
AND SEND ME BACK TO JAIL?

16:39.769 --> 16:42.332
BAILIFF, REMOVE MR. FAULKNER.

16:42.332 --> 16:45.535
WE'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE
TOMORROW.

16:45.535 --> 16:49.139
YOUR HONOR, THE PROSECUTION
CALLS RENEE PERRY TO THE STAND.

16:54.184 --> 16:55.585
RENEE?

16:57.647 --> 16:59.789
RENEE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:02.122 --> 17:03.153
(speaks indistinctly)

17:03.153 --> 17:05.125
RENEE!

17:08.428 --> 17:11.161
I WAS LYING IN BED

17:11.161 --> 17:13.563
WHEN A NOISE FROM THE STREET
WOKE ME UP.

17:13.563 --> 17:17.307
IT WAS ABOUT...
(sighs) 3:00 A.M.

17:17.307 --> 17:22.372
SO I GOT UP AND I WENT
TO THE WINDOW.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.074
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?

17:24.074 --> 17:26.476
I SAW BREE.

17:26.476 --> 17:29.519
HER CLOTHES WERE
KINDA MUDDY, UM...

17:29.519 --> 17:31.151
LEAVES IN HER HAIR.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.224
(sighs) SHE WAS...

17:34.224 --> 17:35.825
WALKING UP HER DRIVEWAY.

17:35.825 --> 17:38.057
WAS SHE CARRYING ANYTHING?

17:39.359 --> 17:41.191
(sighs) YES.

17:41.191 --> 17:42.632
WHAT WAS SHE CARRYING?

17:50.170 --> 17:51.341
A SHOVEL.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.408
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.854
RENEE, WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

18:04.854 --> 18:07.157
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.
I TOLD THE TRUTH.

18:07.157 --> 18:09.489
WHAT YOU SAID IN THERE
COULD REALLY HURT BREE.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.221
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE?

18:11.221 --> 18:14.164
FRIENDS AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

18:14.164 --> 18:16.296
OH, SO I'M ONE
OF THE "FRIENDS" NOW?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.767
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:17.767 --> 18:20.170
ALL YEAR LONG, YOU'VE BEEN
KEEPING A SECRET FROM ME.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.632
HEY, JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

18:22.632 --> 18:25.335
I DIDN'T WANT
TO TESTIFY AGAINST BREE.

18:25.335 --> 18:28.538
THE D.A. WAS GONNA
HAVE BEN DEPORTED.

18:28.538 --> 18:33.343
OH, SO, YEAH, I PICKED
THE MAN I LOVE OVER YOU.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.815
AND JUDGING BY THE WAY
YOU GUYS HAVE TREATED ME,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.417
I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

18:41.191 --> 18:44.123
TRIP. TRIP!

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
THAT WAS BAD?

18:47.857 --> 18:49.429
NOT OUT HERE.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.531
(door opens)

18:51.531 --> 18:52.862
I NEED THE ROOM.

18:52.862 --> 18:54.904
UH, BUT THE JUDGE ASKED ME TO--
 GET OUT.

18:54.904 --> 18:56.836
OKAY.

19:02.472 --> 19:03.873
DID YOU SEE THEIR FACES?

19:03.873 --> 19:05.315
WHOSE FACES?

19:05.315 --> 19:07.247
THE JURORS.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.219
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.222
AFTER RENEE'S LITTLE STORY,

19:12.222 --> 19:16.786
NO ONE ON THAT JURY IS BUYING
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING.

19:16.786 --> 19:19.489
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

19:19.489 --> 19:23.162
I DON'T KNOW, BREE.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.934
YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ME THE TRUTH YET.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.236
TWICE I'VE BEEN BLINDSIDED

19:26.236 --> 19:28.238
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

19:28.238 --> 19:31.501
YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

19:31.501 --> 19:34.274
(whispers) I MADE A PROMISE
TO MY FRIENDS.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.808
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

19:38.808 --> 19:41.481
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
YOU ARE GOING TO GO TO PRISON.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.912
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.815
GOOD. YOU SHOULD BE SCARED.

19:45.815 --> 19:50.290
YOU'RE THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY,
AND IT--AND IT PISSES ME OFF,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.592
'CAUSE THIS AFFECTS
MORE THAN JUST YOU.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.923
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:53.923 --> 19:56.496
LOOK, I-I-I'M SAYING
THAT YOU WERE WRONG BEFORE.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.429
YOU'RE NOT JUST MY CLIENT,
AND I'M NOT JUST YOUR LAWYER.

19:59.429 --> 20:02.472
I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHO...

20:02.472 --> 20:04.434
REALLY...

20:04.434 --> 20:06.306
OH, TO HELL WITH IT.
 (gasps)

20:06.306 --> 20:07.277
MMM.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.612
IT WAS CARLOS.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.415
MMM.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.348
(gasps)

20:18.348 --> 20:20.490
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
NOT TO USE THIS AGAINST HIM...

20:20.490 --> 20:22.452
(whispers) OR ANYONE ELSE.

20:27.357 --> 20:28.828
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.403
(sighs)

20:33.403 --> 20:35.435
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.567
ALEJANDRO
BROKE INTO HER HOUSE,

20:37.567 --> 20:40.440
AND WHEN GABY CAME HOME,
HE ATTACKED HER.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.547
THIS GEM
JUST CAME ON THE MARKET,

20:47.547 --> 20:51.681
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
T'S A WARM, COZY, HOMEY PLACE.

20:51.681 --> 20:54.384
(lowered voice) AND DON'T WORRY,
THEY'RE TAKING THE FURNITURE.

20:54.384 --> 20:57.287
I JUST LOVE YOUR KITCHEN.

20:57.287 --> 20:58.758
OH, THANK YOU.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.431
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY
MORNINGS I'VE SAT HERE,

21:01.431 --> 21:03.593
LOOKING OUT ON THE LANE,
HAVING A CUP OF--GABY.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.496
GABY?

21:06.496 --> 21:07.637
GABY--WHO I HAVEN'T TOLD
I'M MOVING YET.
 (inhales sharply)

21:07.637 --> 21:10.300
OKAY, MR. AND MRS. NEWMAN,
LET ME SHOW YOU THE UPSTAIRS.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.771
UH, WE'RE NOT DONE
LOOKING DOWN HERE.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.573
OH, BUT THE UPSTAIRS
IS WAY BETTER!

21:13.573 --> 21:15.575
IT'S... THAT MUCH CLOSER
TO HEAVEN.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.407
COME ON, GO, GO!

21:17.407 --> 21:18.478
HEY.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.049
(door closes)
 HI! HOW'S IT GOING?

21:20.049 --> 21:22.412
GREAT. IT'S MY TURN TO TAKE CARE
OF MRS. McCLUSKEY,

21:22.412 --> 21:23.853
SO OBVIOUSLY,
I'VE BEEN DRINKING.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.455
CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO THE COURTHOUSE?
 SURE.

21:25.455 --> 21:27.387
(thud overhead)
 SOMEONE UPSTAIRS?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.919
NOPE.
 (Mrs. Newman)
LOOK AT THIS CLOSET SPACE!

21:29.919 --> 21:31.961
JUST SOME OLD FRIENDS
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

21:31.961 --> 21:33.993
(Mr. Newman)
ARE THESE LOW-FLOW TOILETS?

21:33.993 --> 21:37.427
WHO ARE VERY ECO-FRIENDLY.
SO I SHOULD GET BACK TO THEM.

21:37.427 --> 21:38.598
I'LL PICK YOU UP AT NOON.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.472
HEY, GREAT PLACE
YOU HAVE HERE.

21:42.472 --> 21:46.506
UM... GABY, UH,
THESE ARE MY GOOD FRIENDS

21:46.506 --> 21:48.478
FRED AND JEAN.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.582
HELLO. (chuckles)

21:52.582 --> 21:54.344
(clenched teeth)
WHAT YEAR DID YOU GRADUATE?

21:55.485 --> 21:56.646
(chuckles)

21:56.646 --> 22:00.520
MR. WESTON,
IF THE DEFENSE RESTS,

22:00.520 --> 22:02.992
WE CAN MOVE ON
TO CLOSING ARGUMENTS.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.630
ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.462
A NEW WITNESS AT THIS POINT?

22:12.462 --> 22:13.933
SHE'S NOT NEW.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.066
THE DEFENSE RECALLS...

22:17.066 --> 22:18.468
GABRIELLE SOLIS.

22:18.468 --> 22:21.941
(gallery murmuring)

22:21.941 --> 22:23.112
(whispers) YOU PROMISED.

22:23.112 --> 22:24.914
I ALSO PROMISED
TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL.

22:26.816 --> 22:28.117
(lowered voice)
WHAT IS HE DOING?

22:28.117 --> 22:29.819
I-I DON'T KNOW.

22:37.687 --> 22:40.630
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE
STILL UNDER OATH?

22:41.731 --> 22:44.093
MS. SOLIS,

22:44.093 --> 22:48.798
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
A PICTURE OF THE VICTIM.

22:50.540 --> 22:53.543
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN
AS RAMON SANCHEZ?

23:00.109 --> 23:02.752
NO.

23:02.752 --> 23:05.555
YOUR HONOR, I WANT A RECESS.

23:05.555 --> 23:08.618
ONLY YOUR LAWYER CAN ASK
FOR A RECESS, MS. VAN DE KAMP.

23:08.618 --> 23:09.589
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.529
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN
BY ANOTHER NAME?

23:23.673 --> 23:27.176
HIS NAME IS ALEJANDRO PEREZ.

23:29.779 --> 23:32.011
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
MR. PEREZ?

23:39.949 --> 23:43.623
HE WAS...

23:43.623 --> 23:44.854
HE WAS MY STEPFATHER.

23:44.854 --> 23:46.826
(gallery murmuring)
 YOUR HONOR,

23:46.826 --> 23:49.459
I INSIST ON ANOTHER RECESS,
PLEASE.

23:49.459 --> 23:52.702
I'M... FEELING A LITTLE...

23:52.702 --> 23:54.033
(thud)

23:54.033 --> 23:55.665
(gallery gasps)
 BREE!

23:55.665 --> 23:57.837
(gavel banging)
 (Judge Conti) ORDER! ORDER!

23:57.837 --> 24:00.610
WE'RE IN RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW,

24:00.610 --> 24:01.771
AT WHICH TIME WE WILL SEE

24:01.771 --> 24:06.215
IF MS. VAN DE KAMP
IS ABLE TO CONTINUE.

24:06.215 --> 24:07.477
(whispers) BREE?

24:07.477 --> 24:10.780
(whispers) DON'T TOUCH ME.

24:24.033 --> 24:26.195
(whispering) JEEZ! YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

24:26.195 --> 24:28.768
THEY KNOW IT'S ALEJANDRO,
AND YOU DON'T TELL ME?

24:28.768 --> 24:29.799
SHH!

24:30.970 --> 24:32.872
SHE JUST FELL ASLEEP.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.774
OKAY, THIS HAS
GONE FAR ENOUGH.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.476
FIRST THING TOMORROW,
I AM TELLING THE D.A. THE TRUTH.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.148
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

24:39.148 --> 24:41.581
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

24:41.581 --> 24:43.052
YES!

24:43.052 --> 24:44.954
I'M GONNA
TELL THEM IT WAS ME.

24:44.954 --> 24:46.656
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

24:46.656 --> 24:48.718
NO! LOOK, LISTEN TO ME.

24:48.718 --> 24:51.891
I AM A VICTIM OF ABUSE.
THE JURY'S GONNA SIDE WITH ME.

24:51.891 --> 24:55.525
WHO THEY'RE NOT GONNA SIDE WITH
IS YOU, A 2-TIME FELON.

24:55.525 --> 24:57.867
GABY, YOU'RE CRAZY.
 NO, I'M NOT.

24:57.867 --> 25:01.971
SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT WE MET,
YOU'VE PROTECTED ME.

25:01.971 --> 25:03.633
AND I'VE BEEN HAPPY
TO LET YOU DO IT

25:03.633 --> 25:07.076
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THIS SELFISH, SPOILED BRAT.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.679
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT PERSON ANYMORE.

25:09.679 --> 25:12.041
I'M TIRED
OF TAKING FROM YOU.

25:12.041 --> 25:14.884
SO, PLEASE, THIS TIME,
JUST LET ME PROTECT YOU.

25:14.884 --> 25:18.988
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT A JURY IS GONNA BELIEVE

25:18.988 --> 25:22.692
THAT YOU DRAGGED A DEAD BODY
THROUGH THE WOODS YOURSELF?

25:22.692 --> 25:23.793
ADRENALINE. FEAR.

25:23.793 --> 25:25.555
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO.

25:25.555 --> 25:27.757
I DON'T THINK THAT STORY'S
GONNA BE ENOUGH, GABY.

25:27.757 --> 25:30.229
WELL, I'LL TELL THEM EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.902
HE CAME OVER,
HE STARTED ATTACKING ME,

25:32.902 --> 25:35.064
AND INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU
KILLED HIM WITH A CANDLESTICK,

25:35.064 --> 25:37.767
I'LL SAY IT WAS ME.

25:44.874 --> 25:46.646
(crickets chirping)

25:51.751 --> 25:54.183
HONEY, IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:56.856 --> 26:00.630
I WAS JUST THINKING
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.592
REALLY?

26:04.994 --> 26:07.937
YOU WERE JUST SAYING... (sighs)
HOW MUCH YOU WANNA CHANGE,

26:07.937 --> 26:10.840
BUT...

26:10.840 --> 26:12.702
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

26:13.943 --> 26:15.304
YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS AGO,

26:15.304 --> 26:17.607
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE OFFERED
TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF FOR ME.

26:19.609 --> 26:21.580
THANK YOU.

26:25.354 --> 26:26.816
(sighs deeply)

26:26.816 --> 26:29.358
BUT THERE IS NO WAY I'M LETTING
YOU TAKE THE FALL FOR THIS.

26:29.358 --> 26:31.260
WHAT?

26:31.260 --> 26:33.823
BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE PROUD
OF HOW MUCH I'VE CHANGED.

26:33.823 --> 26:35.224
EXACTLY.

26:35.224 --> 26:37.096
YOU'VE BECOME THIS AMAZING
ROLE MODEL FOR OUR DAUGHTERS.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.728
THEY NEED YOU NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

26:38.728 --> 26:40.329
WAIT.
BUT THEY NEED YOU, TOO.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.832
NO, THEY NEED A FATHER
WHO ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY

26:42.832 --> 26:44.373
FOR HIS ACTIONS.

26:44.373 --> 26:49.038
IT HAS TAKEN ME A YEAR, BUT I'M
FINALLY GOING TO BE THAT GUY.

26:49.038 --> 26:52.782
NOW I AM GOING DOWN TO THE COURT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

26:52.782 --> 26:54.113
AND CONFESS EVERYTHING.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.315
CARLOS! WAIT A MINUTE!

26:56.315 --> 26:58.217
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
GABRIELLE,

26:58.217 --> 27:01.320
BUT THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME.

27:04.393 --> 27:06.055
(scoffs)

27:14.633 --> 27:17.737
WHY WOULD I PUT YOU
ON THE STAND?

27:17.737 --> 27:19.809
I WAS AT
THAT PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY.

27:19.809 --> 27:22.341
I CAN TESTIFY THAT RENEE WAS
SO STINKING DRUNK

27:22.341 --> 27:26.245
SHE COULDN'T TELL HER ASS
FROM HER ELBOW.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.647
OKAY.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.679
THAT COULD BE HELPFUL.

27:29.679 --> 27:32.852
I THINK I CAN, UH...

27:32.852 --> 27:34.653
FIT YOU IN NEXT MONDAY.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.425
(chuckles) LOOK AT ME.

27:36.425 --> 27:39.729
I'M WEARING A WIG
AND TOTING AN OXYGEN TANK.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.931
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M GONNA
MAKE IT TO MONDAY?

27:44.193 --> 27:46.265
PUT ME ON THE STAND.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.137
YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.

27:50.439 --> 27:53.672
GABY'S RUNNING LATE.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.045
WHAT THE HELL?
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT?

27:59.979 --> 28:02.982
(indistinct conversations)

28:05.314 --> 28:07.316
LISTEN, IF THEY TAKE ME
INTO CUSTODY RIGHT AWAY,

28:07.316 --> 28:09.258
I WON'T GET A CHANCE
TO TALK TO THE GIRLS.

28:09.258 --> 28:10.419
LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

28:10.419 --> 28:12.021
I DON'T WANT THEM SEEING THIS
ON THE NEWS.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.192
(sighs)
 YOU NEED TO TELL THEM
THAT I LOVE THEM

28:13.192 --> 28:14.764
AND THAT
YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW.

28:14.764 --> 28:16.365
HONEY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
IN CHARGE.

28:16.365 --> 28:18.768
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU MADE ME
WEAR THIS THING. (sighs)

28:18.768 --> 28:21.731
NO, IT'S, UH, IT'S FREEZING
IN THE COURTROOM.

28:21.731 --> 28:23.803
YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.875
(sighs)

28:25.875 --> 28:28.808
SO HANDSOME.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.109
I'M GONNA MISS THIS FACE.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.341
(whispers) I LOVE YOU.

28:36.245 --> 28:38.117
LADIES FIRST.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.449
G-GABY? A LITTLE RUDE.

28:40.449 --> 28:42.221
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.493
GABY, WAIT!

28:45.825 --> 28:46.996
(alarm beeps)

28:46.996 --> 28:48.157
HOLD ON.

28:53.002 --> 28:54.804
(electronic
whirring and beeping)

28:54.804 --> 28:55.905
THAT'S WEIRD.

28:55.905 --> 28:57.736
REMOVE YOUR COAT, PLEASE.
 (wand clatters)

28:59.809 --> 29:00.770
OKAY.

29:05.174 --> 29:06.776
(rip)

29:08.347 --> 29:09.448
SIR...

29:09.448 --> 29:11.821
(click)
 SIR, YOU WANNA EXPLAIN THIS?

29:14.123 --> 29:17.326
I SWEAR, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THAT...

29:17.326 --> 29:18.828
BYE, CARLOS.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.960
GABY, GET BACK HERE!

29:20.960 --> 29:22.862
WE NEED BACKUP!

29:22.862 --> 29:23.833
GABY!

29:23.833 --> 29:26.435
LOVE YOU!

29:26.435 --> 29:30.069
AND, MRS. McCLUSKEY, YOU ARE
A RESIDENT OF WISTERIA LANE.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.370
IS THAT CORRECT?

29:31.370 --> 29:33.803
I'VE LIVED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR 35 YEARS.

29:33.803 --> 29:35.845
WOW. THAT'S A LONG TIME.

29:35.845 --> 29:37.176
NOW RENEE PERRY
HAS TESTIFIED--

29:37.176 --> 29:39.778
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT A NEIGHBORHOOD.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.550
OKAY.

29:41.550 --> 29:45.114
IT'S NOT JUST A BUNCH OF HOUSES
IN THE SAME PLACE.

29:45.114 --> 29:47.186
IT'S A COMMUNITY.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.959
IT'S LIVES
THAT ARE CONNECTED,

29:49.959 --> 29:52.822
PEOPLE WHO CARE
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

29:52.822 --> 29:55.094
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
NOW BACK TO MS. PERRY--

29:55.094 --> 29:59.268
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SAPPY,
BUT DAMN IT, IT'S TRUE.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.333
AND THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
I'D LIVED BESIDE...

30:05.835 --> 30:09.378
WELL, THEY'RE MY FAMILY.

30:09.378 --> 30:12.942
YOUR HONOR, I'M--I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THIS.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.884
WELL, YOU WILL IN A MINUTE,
HONEY.

30:14.884 --> 30:18.848
WHEN YOU'RE IN A FAMILY,
LIKE ME AND THE GIRLS,

30:18.848 --> 30:21.891
YOU PROTECT EACH OTHER.

30:21.891 --> 30:23.953
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE.

30:23.953 --> 30:27.496
SO WHEN, UH,
GABY'S STEPFATHER CAME BACK...

30:27.496 --> 30:28.858
(Trip) UH...

30:28.858 --> 30:30.829
AFTER EVERYTHING
HE'D DONE TO HER...

30:30.829 --> 30:33.262
W-W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:33.262 --> 30:34.603
(scoffs)

30:34.603 --> 30:37.166
IT'S NO SECRET HE ABUSED HER
WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.338
OBJECTION.
 OVERRULED.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.011
SO THAT NIGHT,

30:42.011 --> 30:46.145
WHEN I SAW HIM
CREEPING AROUND THE HOUSE,

30:46.145 --> 30:49.278
I FOLLOWED HIM IN,
I PICKED UP THE CANDLESTICK,

30:49.278 --> 30:51.580
AND I KILLED
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.222
(gallery gasping and murmuring)

30:53.222 --> 30:57.086
(gavel banging)
 (Judge Conti) ORDER!

30:57.086 --> 31:00.159
(murmuring continues)
 ORDER!

31:00.159 --> 31:01.630
ORDER IN THIS COURTROOM!

31:01.630 --> 31:06.966
QUIET DOWN, OR I WILL CLEAR
THE COURTROOM!

31:08.437 --> 31:10.399
STOP THE TRIAL!
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

31:10.399 --> 31:12.541
(whispers)
McCLUSKEY JUST CONFESSED.

31:12.541 --> 31:14.904
MINE CAN WAIT.

31:14.904 --> 31:17.176
(scoffs) YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.279
THERE'S NO WAY THAT FRAIL WOMAN
COULD'VE COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

31:20.279 --> 31:24.653
ADRENALINE. FEAR.

31:24.653 --> 31:26.885
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO.

31:32.261 --> 31:33.923
COUNSELORS...

31:33.923 --> 31:36.565
MY CHAMBER NOW.
 (bangs gavel)

31:36.565 --> 31:39.568
(murmuring resumes)

31:41.570 --> 31:44.934
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

31:44.934 --> 31:46.936
YOUR HONOR,
I HAD NO IDEA.

31:46.936 --> 31:49.008
(scoffs)
 SHE BEGGED ME
TO PUT HER ON THE STAND.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.011
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA
DISCREDIT RENEE PERRY.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.642
OBVIOUSLY, SHE NEEDED TO
GET THIS OFF HER CONSCIENCE.

31:53.642 --> 31:55.414
OH, YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR!

31:55.414 --> 31:58.117
THIS IS A STUNT, A LAST-DITCH
EFFORT TO SAVE HIS CLIENT...

31:58.117 --> 31:59.288
(chuckles)
 AND I WANT HIM SANCTIONED.

31:59.288 --> 32:00.519
ENOUGH.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.922
MR. WESTON, WHERE DO YOU PLAN
ON GOING WITH THIS?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.995
WELL, NOW THAT THE ISSUE
OF SEXUAL ABUSE

32:05.995 --> 32:07.256
HAS BEEN INTRODUCED,

32:07.256 --> 32:08.958
I'LL NEED TO BRING MS. SOLIS
BACK ON THE STAND.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.129
OF COURSE,
SHE'LL TALK ABOUT

32:10.129 --> 32:11.430
WHAT A MONSTER
HER STEPFATHER WAS,

32:11.430 --> 32:14.663
AND AS I RECALL,
MOST OF OUR JURORS ARE PARENTS.

32:14.663 --> 32:17.236
AFTER I'VE TAKEN THEM
THROUGH THE SORDID DETAILS

32:17.236 --> 32:19.308
OF WHAT YOUR VICTIM DID...

32:19.308 --> 32:22.071
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY ALLOW THIS.

32:22.071 --> 32:24.974
GIVEN THE TESTIMONY
OF THE LAST WITNESS, I HAVE TO.

32:27.376 --> 32:31.250
OKAY, MS. STONE,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

32:37.987 --> 32:39.989
MS. STONE?

32:39.989 --> 32:42.161
(sighs)

32:53.072 --> 32:54.503
YOUR HONOR, AT THIS TIME,

32:54.503 --> 32:58.007
WE MOVE TO DISMISS ALL CHARGES
AGAINST BREE VAN DE KAMP.

32:58.007 --> 33:00.479
(applause, gallery murmuring)

33:00.479 --> 33:01.650
(exhales deeply)

33:01.650 --> 33:03.512
(gavel bangs)

33:03.512 --> 33:07.456
MS. STONE,
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

33:07.456 --> 33:11.520
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO FILE
CHARGES AGAINST AT THIS TIME?

33:22.031 --> 33:24.633
GIVEN HER ADVANCED AGE
AND DECLINING HEALTH,

33:24.633 --> 33:26.004
THE PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED

33:26.004 --> 33:28.006
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES
AGAINST KAREN McCLUSKEY.

33:28.006 --> 33:28.777
(murmuring)

33:28.777 --> 33:31.080
(Judge Conti)
ALL RIGHT, IN THAT CASE,

33:31.080 --> 33:34.343
MS. VAN DE KAMP, MRS. McCLUSKEY,
YOU ARE BOTH FREE TO GO.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.615
CASE DISMISSED.
 AAH! (laughs)

33:36.615 --> 33:40.649
(applause)

33:40.649 --> 33:42.621
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.793
THANK YOU.

33:47.496 --> 33:49.728
(Lynette) HEY! OH!

33:51.560 --> 33:53.532
OH, GOD! OH, GOD.
 OH, THANK YOU.

34:00.569 --> 34:02.511
(crickets chirping)

34:02.511 --> 34:05.344
ROY?

34:05.344 --> 34:09.418
WHY AREN'T YOU
AT BREE'S BIG VICTORY PARTY?

34:09.418 --> 34:11.820
UH, THOUGHT I'D
SIT THIS ONE OUT. (chuckles)

34:13.722 --> 34:17.186
FILED DIVORCE PAPERS TODAY,
SO I'M NOT REALLY, UH,

34:17.186 --> 34:19.188
UP TO BUMPING INTO LYNETTE.

34:19.188 --> 34:21.460
ANYWAY, I, UH...

34:21.460 --> 34:23.462
I WANTED TO COME OVER
AND SEE HOW KAREN'S DOING.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.237
INCREDIBLE THING
SHE DID TODAY.

34:28.237 --> 34:31.139
YEAH, I'M PROUD AS HELL.

34:31.139 --> 34:32.771
BUT IT TOOK
A LOT OUT OF HER.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.105
I BROUGHT HER HOME, PUT HER
RIGHT IN BED. (chuckles)

34:36.105 --> 34:39.478
STILL, SHE IS
ONE TOUGH BROAD.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.210
(chuckles)
 AH.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.610
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

34:42.610 --> 34:45.083
KAREN'S POT ROAST RECIPE.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.784
(chuckles)

34:46.784 --> 34:48.657
BEST ONE I EVER TASTED.

34:48.657 --> 34:51.560
SHE SWORE I'D NEVER
GET IT OUT OF HER.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.522
SO HOW'D YOU CONVINCE HER?

34:53.522 --> 34:55.563
(sighs) I...

34:55.563 --> 34:58.567
TOLD HER
WE HAVE THIS GIFT.

34:58.567 --> 35:02.371
WE KNOW THESE ARE
OUR LAST DAYS TOGETHER.

35:02.371 --> 35:05.504
SO WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HOLDING BACK?

35:05.504 --> 35:09.878
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO BE LEFT UNSAID.

35:09.878 --> 35:13.712
SO... (sighs)

35:13.712 --> 35:17.246
WE FINALLY HAD THAT TALK.

35:19.488 --> 35:21.590
YES, SIR.

35:21.590 --> 35:24.193
SHE TOLD ME... (chuckles)

35:24.193 --> 35:25.694
SHE WAS THE ONE

35:25.694 --> 35:29.328
THAT LOST OUR PASSPORTS
ON THE WAY TO MEXICO THAT TIME.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.659
(chuckles)

35:30.659 --> 35:33.532
I TOLD HER THE TRUTH
ABOUT MY TIME IN THE SERVICE,

35:33.532 --> 35:39.268
HOW I WASN'T SOME TOUGH GUY
BUT SCARED TO DEATH.

35:39.268 --> 35:43.312
SHE THANKED ME FOR ALWAYS
BEING ABLE TO MAKE HER LAUGH.

35:45.314 --> 35:46.445
AND I...

35:46.445 --> 35:50.749
(voice breaks) I TOLD HER...

35:50.749 --> 35:53.922
(sniffles) SHE WAS
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.790
TOM...

36:01.790 --> 36:05.934
IT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO SAY THESE THINGS

36:05.934 --> 36:09.238
WHEN YOU CAN,

36:09.238 --> 36:14.373
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

36:15.704 --> 36:16.845
I HEAR YA.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.548
DO YOU?

36:28.687 --> 36:29.858
(pops)

36:29.858 --> 36:32.361
(women scream and laugh)

36:32.361 --> 36:33.662
YAY.

36:34.963 --> 36:37.626
(sighs)

36:37.626 --> 36:39.468
SOMEBODY MAKE A TOAST.

36:39.468 --> 36:40.969
UH... OH, TO BREE,

36:40.969 --> 36:45.474
UM, WHO PUT HER LIFE ON THE LINE
TO PROTECT US,

36:45.474 --> 36:47.406
AND WE WILL NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU DID.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.577
(Gaby) AW.
 HEAR, HEAR.

36:48.577 --> 36:50.939
AND... TO KAREN McCLUSKEY,

36:50.939 --> 36:53.442
THE BRAVEST WOMAN
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

36:53.442 --> 36:54.613
AW.
 (chuckles)

36:54.613 --> 36:55.744
AND TO YOU LADIES,

36:55.744 --> 36:56.945
WHO COULD'VE ABANDONED ME
DURING MY HOUR OF NEED.

36:56.945 --> 37:00.319
OKAY, OKAY.
LESS THANKING, MORE DRINKING.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.320
(clinking)

37:01.320 --> 37:02.791
(Lynette) CHEERS.
 HEY!

37:02.791 --> 37:04.893
HI!

37:04.893 --> 37:06.625
CONGRATULATIONS, BREE.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.698
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW RELIEVED
I AM THAT YOU WEREN'T CONVICTED.

37:09.698 --> 37:11.730
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.462
SERIOUSLY,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW

37:13.462 --> 37:15.504
LIVING ACROSS FROM A MURDERER
CAN AFFECT HOUSING PRICES?

37:15.504 --> 37:16.665
(chuckles)

37:16.665 --> 37:18.707
AH. (sighs)

37:18.707 --> 37:21.470
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?
 WHAT'S UP?

37:21.470 --> 37:23.412
(mouths words)

37:26.375 --> 37:28.617
HAVE YOU TOLD THE GIRLS
YOU'RE MOVING?

37:28.617 --> 37:30.519
UM, NOT YET.

37:30.519 --> 37:32.751
WELL, I THOUGHT IT'D BE EASIER
AFTER THE TRIAL,

37:32.751 --> 37:34.723
BUT NOW
EVERYBODY'S SO HAPPY.

37:34.723 --> 37:36.925
I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND
THE RIGHT TIME.

37:36.925 --> 37:38.487
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIND ONE.

37:38.487 --> 37:40.359
I GOT AN OFFER
ON YOUR HOUSE.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.734
OH, HEY,
YOU'RE OUT OF ICE.

37:45.734 --> 37:46.795
OH, DO YOU HAVE ANY
AT YOUR HOUSE?

37:46.795 --> 37:48.337
YE--
 (door opens)

37:52.401 --> 37:54.743
I THINK I'VE GOT A BAG.

37:54.743 --> 37:57.446
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.379
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 (door closes)

38:00.379 --> 38:01.980
YOU LEFT SO QUICKLY, I-I DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE TO M--

38:01.980 --> 38:03.512
I'M SORRY, THIS IS

38:03.512 --> 38:06.415
A PRIVATE PARTY
FOR MY NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS.

38:06.415 --> 38:08.787
YOU'RE MAD. I-I GET THAT.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.889
BUT...
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.721
THERE'S NOTHING TO EXPLAIN.

38:12.721 --> 38:14.563
YOU SWORE TO ME YOU WOULDN'T
PUT GABY ON THE STAND,

38:14.563 --> 38:16.825
AND THEN YOU DID.
YOU LIED TO ME.

38:16.825 --> 38:19.628
TO WIN THIS CASE...
FOR YOU.

38:19.628 --> 38:21.400
(sighs)

38:21.400 --> 38:22.731
AND--AND--AND ALSO FOR ME.

38:22.731 --> 38:26.935
BREE, THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS
GONNA LET YOU GO TO JAIL.

38:26.935 --> 38:28.777
PLUS THERE'S
THIS THING BETWEEN US AND--

38:28.777 --> 38:29.978
OH, PLEASE.

38:29.978 --> 38:31.840
YOU'RE JUST PRETENDING
THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US

38:31.840 --> 38:33.742
SO YOU COULD GET INFORMATION
FROM ME.

38:33.742 --> 38:35.884
I-I WASN'T TRYING TO GET...

38:35.884 --> 38:36.945
(Bree sighs)

38:36.945 --> 38:39.988
BREE... (sighs)

38:39.988 --> 38:41.790
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE HERE.

38:41.790 --> 38:44.092
I HAD TO TELL YOU...

38:44.092 --> 38:46.395
(whispers) I'M SO SORRY.

38:46.395 --> 38:48.797
(sighs) RENEE,

38:48.797 --> 38:50.459
YOU I CAN FORGIVE.

38:52.401 --> 38:54.903
AND, BEN, YOU'RE MY HERO.

38:56.865 --> 38:59.508
(chuckles) COME ON IN.

39:00.869 --> 39:05.914
AND YOU ARE NOT WELCOME
IN MY HOME.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.363
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.697
(sighs)

39:28.697 --> 39:30.769
THEY'RE KINDA WAITING FOR ME
AT BREE'S.
 (bag rustles)

39:30.769 --> 39:34.803
I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE ICE, SO...

39:35.874 --> 39:38.507
LYNETTE!

39:38.507 --> 39:40.449
LYNETTE, PLEASE.

39:43.011 --> 39:45.383
LOOK...

39:45.383 --> 39:48.016
AT THE END, BEFORE I LEFT,

39:48.016 --> 39:51.119
OUR PROBLEMS LOOKED

39:51.119 --> 39:53.121
THIS BIG...

39:55.794 --> 39:57.566
SO I WENT AWAY.

39:57.566 --> 39:59.868
BUT NOW...

39:59.868 --> 40:02.801
I REALIZED THEY--
THEY ONLY SEEM THAT WAY

40:02.801 --> 40:05.674
BECAUSE WE WERE
SO CLOSE UP AGAINST THEM,

40:05.674 --> 40:08.877
AND--AND--AND THEY WERE
BLOCKING ME FROM SEEING

40:08.877 --> 40:13.942
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,

40:13.942 --> 40:17.946
WHICH IS...

40:20.689 --> 40:21.890
(drops hands)

40:24.993 --> 40:27.896
I SEE THAT NOW,

40:27.896 --> 40:30.999
AND I NEED
TO TELL YOU THAT...

40:30.999 --> 40:33.832
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
SAY THESE THINGS

40:33.832 --> 40:36.004
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

40:37.065 --> 40:40.068
TOM, MY...

40:40.068 --> 40:41.970
ICE IS MELTING,

40:41.970 --> 40:45.744
AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

40:49.918 --> 40:51.720
I'M SAYING...

40:51.720 --> 40:55.854
(voice breaks) THAT I KNOW
YOU'VE MOVED ON,

40:55.854 --> 40:57.586
AND I HOPE
THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY.

40:59.988 --> 41:02.160
BECAUSE YOU, LYNETTE...

41:04.893 --> 41:07.996
YOU WILL...

41:07.996 --> 41:11.700
ALWAYS BE
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

41:17.846 --> 41:18.977
THAT'S ALL.

41:21.009 --> 41:23.051
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'VE MOVED ON?

41:23.051 --> 41:25.554
GREGG TOLD ME
THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM

41:25.554 --> 41:27.986
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, SO...

41:27.986 --> 41:29.888
YEAH, I AM.

41:34.022 --> 41:35.824
YOU.

41:40.068 --> 41:42.801
ME?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.703
YOU.

41:51.039 --> 41:53.181
YOU.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.686
YOU.

42:02.791 --> 42:05.093
YOU.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.008
(sighs)
