00:53.261 --> 00:56.264
- What are you gonna cook?
- Your favourite.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.349
What, again?

01:11.821 --> 01:16.534
- Well, this is the last one.
- What, you mean no more tomatoes?

01:16.611 --> 01:20.079
You can never have
enough tins of tomatoes, eh?

01:20.162 --> 01:22.623
Instead...

01:22.707 --> 01:25.668
we've got five tins of chickpeas.

01:25.751 --> 01:29.297
That should last at least five year, eh?

01:31.340 --> 01:34.177
- Fancy a glass of wine?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.103
We're in luck.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.857
Drinkable.

02:05.249 --> 02:08.961
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:11.339 --> 02:15.051
Well, I'm not fine, it's all fucked, but...

02:15.134 --> 02:19.055
- Our children are safe, aren't they?
- Totally. Yeah.

02:19.138 --> 02:22.558
Thank God we paid for that school trip.
Imagine if we hadn't!

02:22.642 --> 02:25.978
I can't. I can't imagine. I can't imagine.

02:26.062 --> 02:31.275
And I don't want to imagine. I don't...
Listen, they're far, far away.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.402
And they're safe and sound.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.571
OK?

02:35.655 --> 02:37.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.033
OK.

02:39.575 --> 02:41.661
Don't worry...

02:43.037 --> 02:45.748
gorgeous.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.763
Not interrupting, am I?

03:04.767 --> 03:06.060
No.

03:06.143 --> 03:08.521
I found this in the cellar.

03:08.604 --> 03:13.484
I'd forgotten all about it.
I thought we could have them after dinner.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.278
Yeah.

03:31.502 --> 03:35.840
- It smells wonderful.
- And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

03:35.923 --> 03:39.010
- It is indeed, Geoff.
- Thank you.

03:39.093 --> 03:42.346
There's chocolate for after,
courtesy of your good wife.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.892
What have we here? I get blackberries.

03:46.851 --> 03:50.188
Vanilla. Notes of autumn.

03:54.650 --> 03:56.777
Karen?

04:02.658 --> 04:04.785
He'll be hungry.

04:06.078 --> 04:09.248
When he gets back
he'll want something to eat.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.459
- Here we go again.
- Jacob, no.

04:11.542 --> 04:15.713
Let me tell you something. It's five days
since your boyfriend ran out on us.

04:15.796 --> 04:18.882
If he's still breathing,
he won't be interested in pasta.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.760
Jacob!

04:20.843 --> 04:23.804
- It'll be your fucking neck!
- Don't say that!

04:23.888 --> 04:26.015
- Out of order, Jacob.
- Why?

04:26.098 --> 04:29.560
We all know it's true.
The sooner she faces it, the better.

04:29.644 --> 04:34.148
There are no survivors.
It's just us in here and them out there.

04:38.819 --> 04:41.072
- Sam?
- Quiet!

04:41.155 --> 04:45.117
- God, it's a boy.
- Wait, wait. You don't know who's out there.

04:45.201 --> 04:49.080
- Please, let me in!
- Don, it's a kid!

04:49.163 --> 04:52.166
Help! Let me in!

04:52.250 --> 04:54.126
Bloody hell.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.676
- Please! Please, let me in!
- We're coming.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.761
Let me in!

05:04.887 --> 05:07.640
Please! Help! Let me in!

05:07.723 --> 05:09.934
Please!

05:10.017 --> 05:13.312
Get in. Come on, get in. Come here.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.454
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.297
- Where have you come from?
- Sandford.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.091
Sandford's upriver a few miles.

05:43.551 --> 05:48.306
- How did you get here?
- They were chasing me. Screaming.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.808
I was scared. I ran.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.520
I tried other houses.
They were empty.

05:54.604 --> 06:00.401
I came through the woods
and I followed the river until I got here.

06:00.484 --> 06:02.820
- Who were chasing you?
- My mum.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.239
My dad.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.201
They're trying to kill me.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.413
- There's others, too.
- How many?

06:14.790 --> 06:16.751
- Loads.
- Sam?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.967
- It's got me! It's got my arm!
- Karen, no!

06:25.051 --> 06:27.053
Help me!

06:50.576 --> 06:55.665
Alice! Get outta here!
Get down the escape hatch, go! Go!

06:56.207 --> 07:00.044
- Geoff, I can't see. I can't see!
- Hold onto my hand!

07:00.753 --> 07:02.713
Die, you fucker! Die!

07:13.307 --> 07:15.810
Come back!

07:17.144 --> 07:19.063
Oh, God!

07:21.274 --> 07:25.027
Keep going. Follow Jacob.
Keep going. Sally, there's no time.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.905
- We can't leave them!
- Sally, come on!

07:27.989 --> 07:29.866
Go!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.998
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

07:40.042 --> 07:42.170
Where are you?

07:42.253 --> 07:45.423
- Where are you?
- Alice! Alice, no! Alice!

07:49.177 --> 07:51.053
Geoff, come on!

07:51.929 --> 07:53.264
Come on!

07:55.016 --> 07:56.058
Geoff!

07:56.976 --> 07:59.896
Sally, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, Sally!

08:01.731 --> 08:05.067
No! Jacob! Help me!

08:14.243 --> 08:15.953
Alice! Alice!

08:20.583 --> 08:23.336
- Where are you?
- Come on! Leave him!

08:23.419 --> 08:25.338
- I see him there!
- Leave him!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.590
Let go!

08:28.299 --> 08:29.467
Quick!

08:31.135 --> 08:33.554
Don! Help us!

08:38.851 --> 08:40.269
Don!

08:42.355 --> 08:44.649
Don!

08:44.732 --> 08:46.817
Get in there!

09:04.168 --> 09:06.045
Don!

09:06.921 --> 09:08.506
Don!

09:11.050 --> 09:13.094
Don!

09:48.838 --> 09:51.132
Jacob!

09:51.674 --> 09:53.676
Come on!

09:57.013 --> 09:58.222
Jacob!

10:01.809 --> 10:03.686
Dear God!

10:07.190 --> 10:09.400
Jacob!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.001
Jacob!

10:54.445 --> 10:57.156
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.325
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.221
Welcome to London.

12:44.138 --> 12:47.016
Hey, Doyle, you having fun down there?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.560
You can kiss my ass.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.064
This is the worst combat I ever saw.
Where's the combat?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.273
I hear you.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.692
- Give me something to shoot.
- Too easy.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.946
North-east of med centre,
20th floor, three windows in.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.991
- Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.
- Oh, bug-nuts. Him again.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.619
I don't see him.
Where is Fester Fucknut?

13:06.702 --> 13:09.330
His dick in his hand on the 20th floor.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.000
Next to the fire exit.
I think he needs ajerk-off extender.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.753
Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.797
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.634
- Think it might be your dad, Doyle.
- You got me.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.665
Shit.

13:54.625 --> 13:59.130
- Colonel Phillips here. What is your status?
- Good morning, Colonel.

13:59.213 --> 14:03.259
- Morning.
- I'm watching the new arrivals disembark.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.052
Yes, Major?

14:05.136 --> 14:08.389
- It'll take all morning to process them.
- Copy.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.934
No one told me that
we're now admitting children.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.741
Just follow around to your right.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.187
Green and brown. Interesting iris variation.

14:56.270 --> 15:01.484
It's usually hereditary.
Do one of your parents have the same?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.736
My mother. She did.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.620
- How old are you, Andy?
- 12.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.875
I think that makes you
the youngest person in the country.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.503
Well, your blood pressure is A-OK

15:20.586 --> 15:23.965
and you're negative
on any serious diseases or afflictions.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.217
I think you're OK to come in.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.344
Welcome back to Britain.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.660
We are headed for our area
of security and reconstruction

16:34.744 --> 16:37.121
designated as District One.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.374
District One is located on the Isle of Dogs.

16:40.458 --> 16:46.964
Although the Isle of Dogs is completely safe,
the surrounding area of London is not.

16:47.048 --> 16:52.261
Large numbers of bodies are still not cleared
from the original outbreak of infection.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.307
Rats and wild dogs are prevalent,
as is disease.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.727
New arrivals are reminded
for their own safety

16:59.810 --> 17:05.148
it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

17:05.233 --> 17:11.155
You will be joining 15,000 civilians
who are already resident in District One.

17:11.239 --> 17:16.993
As we approach your new home, you'll notice
a dramatically increased military presence.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.914
The US Army is responsible for your safety.

17:19.997 --> 17:25.586
We will do everything we can do
to make your repatriation as easy as possible.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.924
Inside District One, however,
we believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

17:30.007 --> 17:34.178
We have hot and cold running water,
24-hour electricity,

17:34.262 --> 17:38.724
a medical centre,
a supermarket and even a pub.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.648
We're nearly home.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.800
- Dad! Dad!
- It's Dad! Come on.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.577
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.377
I missed you so much.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.256
Are you all right? Are you all right?

18:54.842 --> 18:58.054
Guys. I never thought
I'd see you again, you know that?

19:09.524 --> 19:12.610
Let's get something to eat.

19:18.199 --> 19:21.994
I should have been notified
before children were brought in.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.914
We've not established
the protocol for minors.

19:24.997 --> 19:30.294
We have issues of disease and sanitation.
We don't fully understand the virus yet.

19:30.378 --> 19:34.006
We understand that it did not manage
to go cross-species,

19:34.090 --> 19:39.345
that it did not manage to go airborne and that
the last infected human died six months ago.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.348
- We weren't here six months ago.
- Major.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.231
- What are you afraid of?
- What if it comes back?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.025
- It won't come back.
- What if it does?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.820
If it comes back, we kill it.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.447
Code Red.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.834
Come on, guys.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.588
What about this place, then, Andy?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.549
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.895
Look at the camera.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.272
This way. Come through.

20:32.190 --> 20:36.485
It's 25 floors. We've got the penthouse
up there. Believe me.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.113
ID, sir. Thank you.

20:39.197 --> 20:43.034
- So, what do you do here, Dad?
- What do I do? I'm a section officer.

20:43.117 --> 20:47.872
I keep the lights on, the water running,
the heat running. See this? Look.

20:47.955 --> 20:53.503
That says triple A - "access all areas".
That's me. I basically run the place, you know.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.632
No. You're the caretaker really, aren't you?

21:00.343 --> 21:02.762
No, I run the place.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.813
Like it?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.942
- It's amazing!
- Even better than sunny Spain?

21:16.025 --> 21:21.948
You ought to have seen the camps. There
were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.909
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

21:27.286 --> 21:32.250
We'll be moving to a new house soon.
A couple of months, in fact.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.669
A new house?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.879
Yeah.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.218
Listen, I hope you guys understand.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.180
We're not gonna be able
to go back to our old house.

21:46.264 --> 21:53.062
It's outside the security zone and I don't think
I'd want to go back there, even if I could.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.857
What happened, Dad? To Mum?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.736
Yeah.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.366
Yeah.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.705
Do you wanna sit down
and I'll tell you all about it?

22:23.801 --> 22:26.929
Your mum and I were hiding in a house.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.475
A wee cottage.

22:34.979 --> 22:38.524
It was an old couple that owned it

22:40.151 --> 22:42.445
and they were there, too.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.907
Three other people.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.119
And we were...

22:52.705 --> 22:55.625
just trying to stay alive, I suppose.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.921
We were doing OK for a while.
And then we were attacked.

23:03.382 --> 23:07.345
They came in through the kitchen window.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.890
They were really fast, you know.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.311
Chased us.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.190
Chased your mum.

23:20.983 --> 23:26.239
And we were trapped.
Trapped in the bedroom.

23:26.948 --> 23:27.990
Don!

23:30.117 --> 23:32.203
And I see...

23:33.788 --> 23:35.873
I see them...

23:38.543 --> 23:41.087
biting her.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.464
I couldn't do anything.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.932
I tried to go back.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.894
She was already gone.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.986
She was already gone.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.990
Was there nothing you could do?

24:11.409 --> 24:14.453
No, there was nothing I could do.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.293
I managed to get away.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.756
Just running, running, running...

24:30.845 --> 24:33.764
I got to this military camp.

24:36.767 --> 24:43.024
And you know the rest. You know I've been
in quarantine waiting for you to come back.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.823
We're just happy you're still alive.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.925
I'm sorry.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.730
Doyle...

26:04.814 --> 26:08.359
- Doyle, you bastard.
- Boy, I've never seen you get so white.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.319
- Fuck you.
- Good morning.

26:10.403 --> 26:14.282
Yeah, fuck outta here, man.
I'm having all good dreams.

26:14.365 --> 26:18.953
Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies,
I'm laying in bed with my wife...

26:19.036 --> 26:21.956
And now I'm back in this shithole.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.457
- I know.
- Yeah?

26:23.541 --> 26:26.711
I had that same dream about your wife.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.298
- Quit fucking with me.
- Get outta here.

26:30.381 --> 26:36.637
- All right. Next time I'm gonna shoot you.
- All right. See you later, family man.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.228
I told you, I'm gonna shoot you.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.054
What's on the TV tonight?

28:42.930 --> 28:45.850
Are you OK? Bad dream?

28:51.397 --> 28:55.318
I get worried I'm gonna forget
what she looks like.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.486
You won't forget.

28:58.154 --> 29:01.073
I don't even have a picture of her.

29:02.116 --> 29:04.202
You won't forget.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.832
Promise?

29:09.916 --> 29:12.001
Yeah.

29:21.219 --> 29:23.888
Andy, we agreed.
You heard what they said.

29:23.971 --> 29:28.142
It's only dogs and rats out there.
We'll get what we want and come back again.

29:28.226 --> 29:31.604
- We should've told Dad.
- It's fine. Trust me.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.482
They won't even know we're gone.

30:06.597 --> 30:09.100
Where are you going?

30:11.686 --> 30:15.356
Base, come in. We have two strays
who slipped out the north gate.

30:15.439 --> 30:19.151
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.612
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

30:21.696 --> 30:23.239
Yes! Yeah!

30:23.322 --> 30:25.700
London's mine!

30:37.128 --> 30:39.672
That's what we need.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.800
Yeah, if it had keys.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.804
Wait here.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.592
Let's go.

34:05.002 --> 34:07.088
There you go.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.504
Tam!

34:52.466 --> 34:54.552
Tam!

34:57.930 --> 35:00.016
Tam?

35:05.354 --> 35:07.648
Tammy, are you there?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.030
Tam?

35:14.113 --> 35:15.907
Tammy!

35:16.115 --> 35:18.201
Tammy!

35:54.612 --> 35:58.908
Tammy, this is stupid.
You're not being funny.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.686
I knew it.

36:47.081 --> 36:49.667
You're hurting me!

37:00.219 --> 37:03.639
No! No! No! No!

37:03.723 --> 37:05.933
No, don't go! No!

37:06.517 --> 37:08.186
No!

37:08.644 --> 37:09.687
No!

37:20.448 --> 37:23.201
Doyle.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.995
I got your puppies.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.222
No!

37:50.561 --> 37:54.023
Get off me! Get off me!

38:07.411 --> 38:10.665
I apologise for these precautions.

38:10.748 --> 38:16.045
It's standard protocol with any survivors,
though we haven't had to do it for a while.

38:16.128 --> 38:21.008
The last survivor we came across
was over two months ago.

38:22.510 --> 38:28.641
Can you tell me anything
about how you managed to keep alive

38:28.724 --> 38:30.726
while you were gone so long?

38:34.856 --> 38:37.859
Do you know of any other survivors?

38:41.404 --> 38:43.322
OK.

38:43.406 --> 38:47.160
I'm just going to take a blood sample.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.328
It won't hurt.

38:59.046 --> 39:03.092
Have you come into direct contact
with the infected?

39:13.352 --> 39:16.063
OK.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.033
I want to see my children.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.372
Of course. Of course.

39:53.935 --> 39:55.269
- Mr Harris.
- Yeah.

39:55.353 --> 39:59.482
- We've found your kids.
- Oh, thank God. Thank you so much.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.859
We found your wife, too.

40:13.246 --> 40:15.915
Can they hear me?

40:15.998 --> 40:19.961
- So, what do you two think you're playing at?
- You said you saw her die.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.630
- What?
- You said you saw her die!

40:26.259 --> 40:28.469
- I didn't say that.
- You did. You did.

40:28.553 --> 40:31.138
Baby, I didn't use those words.

40:31.222 --> 40:34.767
This is... I don't know.
I mean, it's confusing, you know.

40:34.851 --> 40:38.688
It's... it's very hard
for you to imagine, you know?

40:38.771 --> 40:42.692
- I... It's too hard to explain.
- Well, try to explain it, Dad! Try!

40:42.775 --> 40:47.488
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mum... die.

40:47.572 --> 40:51.117
Or I wouldn't have told you that.
I was sure.

40:53.369 --> 40:57.832
Look, guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here...

40:57.915 --> 41:00.334
but it's good. OK?

41:00.418 --> 41:03.212
That's the point. Mum's alive.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.590
I want to see her!

41:42.376 --> 41:45.213
There's no question, sir.

41:45.296 --> 41:47.548
She has the virus. She's infected.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.428
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

41:53.095 --> 41:54.972
- I don't know.
- Speculate.

41:59.685 --> 42:03.773
A genetic abnormality which acts
as some sort of natural immunity?

42:03.856 --> 42:09.946
But the virus is still in her blood and saliva,
so technically she's not immune.

42:10.029 --> 42:12.240
She's a carrier.

42:12.323 --> 42:15.034
She has the ability to infect others?

42:15.117 --> 42:17.203
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

42:21.249 --> 42:24.794
If this woman has natural immunity
she is incredibly valuable.

42:24.877 --> 42:30.174
Her blood could contain
the key to a vaccine, even a cure.

42:37.807 --> 42:40.226
Alice.

42:44.689 --> 42:46.774
Hey, baby.

42:49.986 --> 42:53.531
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was scared.

42:57.493 --> 42:59.662
I shouldn't have run away.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.747
I was scared.

43:05.376 --> 43:07.795
Please forgive me.

43:07.879 --> 43:11.549
Please, sir. We need time to study her.
We need to run some tests.

43:11.632 --> 43:14.760
You can run tests on her corpse, Major.

43:17.889 --> 43:20.183
I love you, Don.

43:26.522 --> 43:28.608
Yeah.

43:30.735 --> 43:33.070
Oh, God, I love you, too.

44:48.271 --> 44:49.647
Don!

46:08.643 --> 46:13.105
Clear channels to control room.
Control room, this is General Stone.

46:13.189 --> 46:17.735
All forces under my control, prepare
to execute Code Red on my command.

46:17.819 --> 46:19.529
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

46:19.612 --> 46:23.449
Break, break, break, all stations.
Sunray in 30 seconds.

46:23.533 --> 46:27.453
We have an outbreak in the med centre.
All units, safeties off.

46:27.537 --> 46:30.206
- Affirmative.
- Open air cav transmission.

46:30.289 --> 46:34.752
- Prepare containment areas.
- Move civilians to containment areas.

46:34.836 --> 46:39.006
Command personnel secure in bunker.
Confirm order to lock down.

46:39.090 --> 46:41.425
Lockdown confirmed.

46:41.509 --> 46:43.803
Execute Code Red.

46:49.517 --> 46:54.689
Flynn, come in. Flynn, do you hear
that Code Red or am I losing my shit?

46:54.772 --> 46:56.649
I was about to ask the same thing.

46:59.735 --> 47:02.280
Ten-hut!

47:21.966 --> 47:26.888
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll be back in a moment.

47:28.389 --> 47:32.226
- It's probably nothing.
- Tam, it didn't sound like nothing.

47:32.310 --> 47:34.729
He said he'd be back in a moment.

48:09.597 --> 48:11.891
Are you OK? Let's go.

48:14.852 --> 48:17.438
Come on.

48:18.564 --> 48:22.235
- Move, move, move! Let's go!
- Andy, keep hold of my hand.

48:22.318 --> 48:24.612
OK, come on. Keep it moving.

48:24.695 --> 48:26.823
Come on, people. Come on.

48:26.906 --> 48:30.618
- Don't push.
- Sir, all civilians into the containment area.

48:30.701 --> 48:36.249
These kids are with me. It's important they are
kept protected. I need to get them out of here.

48:36.332 --> 48:40.753
- Sir, no exceptions. It's a Code Red.
- I know what it is. My name is...

48:40.837 --> 48:42.588
- Andy!
- Scarlet!

48:42.672 --> 48:44.257
Andy!

48:44.340 --> 48:45.633
- Tammy!
- Andy!

48:45.716 --> 48:47.468
- Andy, wait!
- Scarlet!

48:47.552 --> 48:50.471
- Just wait, Andy! We're coming!
- Calm down. Calm down, now.

48:59.397 --> 49:03.359
Move down. Move down the room.
Keep moving. Go, go, go. Come on.

49:03.442 --> 49:07.738
- You think it's a drill?
- Of course not. Someone saw an infected.

49:08.781 --> 49:11.909
Keep moving. That's it.
Good, good. Let's go.

49:11.993 --> 49:14.954
- Why are you sealing us inside?
- For your protection.

49:15.037 --> 49:18.916
- Just guard the door. Don't lock it.
- It's for your own protection.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.711
- We've got to find Andy.
- We'll find him.

49:46.486 --> 49:50.239
- Shut down civilian areas.
- Sector one, lockdown.

49:50.323 --> 49:54.911
- Sector eight, lockdown.
- Sector three, lockdown.

50:11.677 --> 50:16.516
Switch to emergency lighting.
Use of non-lethal force authorised.

50:16.599 --> 50:19.143
All snipers in position.

50:19.227 --> 50:24.148
- Ground forces to med centre.
- Ground force to med centre.

50:25.066 --> 50:27.109
Sector one covered.

50:33.616 --> 50:36.410
Everyone, stay calm.

50:57.390 --> 50:59.267
Dad.

51:16.367 --> 51:18.452
No! My dad... my dad!

51:20.204 --> 51:22.165
He's in here!

52:31.025 --> 52:32.485
No!

52:32.568 --> 52:37.824
Containment area, containment area,
move into position.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.626
No!

53:02.431 --> 53:04.809
I confirm, only target infected.

53:04.892 --> 53:07.311
Roger that. Only target infected.

53:15.528 --> 53:18.281
Targeting right. I've had two down.

53:21.409 --> 53:24.120
Watch out for the friendlies.

53:24.203 --> 53:26.539
I can't get a shot.

53:28.249 --> 53:30.960
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

53:33.087 --> 53:35.882
We got a group there at 12 o'clock.

53:35.965 --> 53:41.470
- We've got one at three o'clock.
- On the ground, got four.

53:42.722 --> 53:44.891
16 down.

53:48.352 --> 53:50.813
I got two by the Jeep.

53:53.316 --> 53:56.652
- Jesus.
- I don't see who's a target.

54:00.531 --> 54:04.744
On the move! On the move!
Moving right! Moving right!

54:05.495 --> 54:09.540
I can't find
the designated target here.

54:09.957 --> 54:12.668
I cannot be target-specific.

54:12.752 --> 54:16.547
Whisky Three, why have you stopped firing?
Come in.

54:16.631 --> 54:22.094
Abandon selective targeting.
Shoot everything. Targets are now free.

54:22.178 --> 54:24.347
We've lost control.

54:29.519 --> 54:35.650
All units, all units, this is Medical
Commanding Officer Sierra Lima.

54:35.733 --> 54:39.654
Please be on the lookout for a young boy,
age 12, name, Andy.

54:42.657 --> 54:47.662
If he is located he must be immediately
evacuated from the containment zone.

54:47.745 --> 54:49.831
We have to find Andy.

54:49.914 --> 54:52.792
- We have to find him!
- It's OK. It's OK.

54:52.875 --> 54:56.587
We're gonna find him, OK?
We're gonna find him, I promise.

54:56.671 --> 55:02.385
I'm gonna get him out of here.
I'm gonna get you both out of here. Trust me.

55:23.239 --> 55:27.034
- New shot.
- Abandon selective targeting.

55:28.494 --> 55:32.915
- Confirm order?
- Target everyone at ground level.

55:32.999 --> 55:36.419
No exceptions. Repeat, no exceptions.

55:44.343 --> 55:45.595
Come on!

56:03.446 --> 56:07.033
Three down.
One of ours down there. Three o'clock.

56:20.713 --> 56:22.882
- Taking them down.
- Left sector, three o'clock.

56:27.720 --> 56:30.181
Kid! Over here!

56:30.264 --> 56:32.808
Kid! Over here!

56:46.656 --> 56:50.201
- I got him.
- Well, take him out. Take him out.

56:50.284 --> 56:53.788
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

56:55.206 --> 56:57.333
Fuck.

56:59.877 --> 57:01.963
Fuck.

57:11.305 --> 57:13.391
Fuck!

58:25.963 --> 58:27.340
Tam?

58:48.903 --> 58:50.988
This is madness.

58:52.114 --> 58:55.326
- What's happening?
- They're shooting everybody.

58:55.409 --> 59:00.540
- Why? It makes no sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

59:00.623 --> 59:02.500
It's Code Red.

59:15.429 --> 59:17.390
I saw Dad.

59:17.473 --> 59:19.892
Where?

59:19.976 --> 59:22.520
He's one of them.

59:23.688 --> 59:27.024
Step one, kill the infected.

59:27.108 --> 59:30.278
Step two, containment.

59:30.778 --> 59:33.072
If containment fails...

59:34.532 --> 59:37.451
step three, extermination.

59:38.077 --> 59:41.831
Now they won't stop until everyone is dead.

59:43.541 --> 59:45.626
So what do we do?

59:46.544 --> 59:50.631
I mean, I'm not sitting around here
to get exterminated.

59:50.715 --> 59:52.675
We've gotta get outta here.

59:52.758 --> 59:57.597
If we take one step out of that door,
if the infected don't get us, the snipers will.

59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.017
Well, you don't have a choice, my friend.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.730
Right now it's dark out there. The snipers
can see you through their night scopes,

01:00:05.813 --> 01:00:10.943
but at least you have
some limited cover from the infected.

01:00:11.027 --> 01:00:15.406
But, you know, if you wanna wait till sun-up
then you're as good as dead.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.700
Who are you?

01:00:17.783 --> 01:00:20.912
Sergeant Doyle. Delta rooftop unit.

01:00:21.454 --> 01:00:23.956
Why aren't you at your post?

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.918
Why aren't you?

01:00:28.377 --> 01:00:33.799
Look, you guys do what you want,
but I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.

01:00:34.258 --> 01:00:36.802
You coming?

01:00:42.266 --> 01:00:44.268
All right, come on.

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:57.073
- Less shooting.
- Maybe it's under control.

01:00:57.156 --> 01:00:59.575
Or there are less shooters.

01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:04.914
All right, listen. I need you guys
to look at me and only me, OK?

01:01:04.997 --> 01:01:08.584
You run when I run.
Be my shadow. That's it, all right?

01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:10.962
Get around back. Watch her.

01:01:12.755 --> 01:01:15.258
Ready? Let's go.

01:01:26.352 --> 01:01:28.813
Stay.

01:01:32.024 --> 01:01:34.527
Doyle, come in.

01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:42.702
- Flynn, go.
- Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

01:01:46.247 --> 01:01:50.084
- Ground level, District One.
- Shit. Close frequency.

01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:52.295
Copy that.

01:01:54.547 --> 01:01:58.968
What the fuck are you doing there?
You got some serious shit coming your way.

01:01:59.051 --> 01:02:02.722
- We already got some serious shit.
- I'm not playing. This is worse.

01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:06.976
The air cav just got their orders.
They're firebombing all of District One.

01:02:07.059 --> 01:02:09.520
- That was fast.
- Outbreak is out of control.

01:02:09.604 --> 01:02:15.026
They're taking no chances. So unless you are
out of the target zone, you are getting cooked.

01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:18.529
- How long we got?
- They're on their way. Four minutes, tops.

01:02:18.613 --> 01:02:24.076
But listen. I got some clear landing ground
at Regent's Park. That's the pick-up point.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.248
- I'll be back in touch.
- Doyle, you fucking better be.

01:02:29.707 --> 01:02:33.544
All right, look, guys, we gotta run.
Just stay low and stay fast, OK?

01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:35.922
After me. Let's go.

01:02:42.762 --> 01:02:45.890
- Snipers! Get down! Snipers!
- Back! Back! Back!

01:02:45.973 --> 01:02:47.809
Get back! Get back!

01:02:47.892 --> 01:02:50.812
Andy, get back!

01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:53.815
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

01:02:56.108 --> 01:02:58.069
- Shit.
- Fuck!

01:02:58.152 --> 01:03:01.072
It's OK. It's just a flesh wound.

01:03:16.879 --> 01:03:18.840
Multiple shots, one hit.

01:03:20.258 --> 01:03:22.844
He's a panicker, no marksman.

01:03:28.224 --> 01:03:30.476
OK.

01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:32.770
- What's your name?
- Sam.

01:03:32.854 --> 01:03:36.482
OK, Sam. Come here. Get closer.
Do you see that doorway?

01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:42.446
I need you to run as fast as you can in a
zigzag like this, OK? Don't stop for anything.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:48.119
- You want me to be bait?
- He'll take shots at you, but he'll miss.

01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:52.165
He's gonna expose his position.
Means I get a shot at him. I won't miss.

01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:55.376
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Stay back.

01:03:56.586 --> 01:04:00.965
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.
You want that?

01:04:01.048 --> 01:04:02.425
No!

01:04:02.508 --> 01:04:03.968
Andy!

01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:05.136
Fuck!

01:04:30.495 --> 01:04:32.747
Good work, kid.

01:04:39.545 --> 01:04:42.507
- The fence!
- Watch it, watch it. Behind me.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.634
Go! Go! Go!

01:04:47.386 --> 01:04:49.889
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:52.642
Jump!

01:05:08.866 --> 01:05:11.786
This is Red Fox One pouring whisky.

01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:17.834
Keep going!
We'll be safe under the river.

01:07:02.271 --> 01:07:03.856
Go! Go!

01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:09.946
Come on. Come on!

01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:17.411
Run! Run!

01:07:32.093 --> 01:07:36.055
Bring in biological units.
Fan out from predesignated positions.

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:38.432
Bio units, copy.

01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:45.648
Use of chemical weapons authorised.
Repeat, chemical weapons are authorised.

01:10:38.696 --> 01:10:40.781
Stay close.

01:10:59.133 --> 01:11:01.427
They left us again.

01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:07.433
Do you think Mum's still alive?

01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:11.521
Not this time.

01:11:46.222 --> 01:11:50.101
- You look a little pale.
- Blood makes me nauseous.

01:11:50.184 --> 01:11:53.354
You never answered my question.

01:11:53.437 --> 01:11:55.982
About why you left your post.

01:11:56.065 --> 01:11:58.317
When I got that boy in my sights.

01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:05.116
That's not a target any more.

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.957
When we were separated...

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.668
I thought I'd lost you, too.

01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:20.590
We won't get separated again.

01:12:20.673 --> 01:12:24.260
We'll stay together, whatever happens.

01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.138
Whatever happens.

01:12:28.014 --> 01:12:30.308
It was all fucked.

01:12:33.144 --> 01:12:37.106
You could hear it all over the radios. Fucked.

01:12:42.361 --> 01:12:44.864
Anyway, what about you?

01:12:46.657 --> 01:12:52.914
- Why the hell are you here?
- Their mother had very special blood.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.085
A natural kind of immunity to the virus.

01:13:02.632 --> 01:13:05.384
Not all genetic traits are passed on, you know.

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:09.806
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:12.892
But they might have it.

01:13:12.975 --> 01:13:15.061
It's a possibility.

01:13:17.271 --> 01:13:21.317
So their lives are far more valuable than mine.

01:13:24.403 --> 01:13:26.864
Or yours.

01:13:28.866 --> 01:13:30.284
I got it.

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:34.956
Doyle!

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.416
Doyle!

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.461
- Flynn, go.
- You made it!

01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:44.715
I knew you'd do it. Listen. I'm coming
to you right now, but keep a lookout.

01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:48.386
There's sightings of infected
that have escaped the firebombing.

01:13:48.469 --> 01:13:51.472
- Give me an ETA.
- About 60.

01:13:51.556 --> 01:13:54.600
- Minutes?
- No. Seconds.

01:13:57.979 --> 01:13:59.063
All right, kids. Come on.

01:14:03.734 --> 01:14:05.945
Get down. Down! Down!

01:14:27.842 --> 01:14:30.386
I see you. I'm coming in.

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:36.350
Jesus, Doyle, you got people with you.
Who the fuck are those people?

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.408
Doyle! Who the fuck are those people?

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:56.746
I can't take 'em. We will be shot out of the sky
if I try to land at the base.

01:14:56.829 --> 01:15:00.374
No, no, don't take 'em to base!
Take 'em over the Channel!

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:02.960
- What?
- We gotta get these kids outta here.

01:15:03.044 --> 01:15:05.880
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking 'em!

01:15:05.963 --> 01:15:09.550
- Get me out of here!
- Sam, come back!

01:15:09.634 --> 01:15:14.263
Hey, get the fuck off there!
Get that fucker off my ski!

01:15:14.347 --> 01:15:17.475
- OK, you wanna fly with me, asshole?
- Sam!

01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:20.061
Come on!

01:15:34.116 --> 01:15:35.451
Fuck!

01:15:35.535 --> 01:15:38.579
We're gonna die down here!
Do something!

01:15:38.663 --> 01:15:41.082
You wanna fuck?

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:45.336
Come on, you fuckers!

01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:56.639
Get up! Run! Move it!

01:16:18.619 --> 01:16:21.789
Don't look back! Keep going!

01:16:22.874 --> 01:16:25.001
Keep going.

01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:34.135
Fuck you, pussy!

01:16:50.401 --> 01:16:52.737
Doyle, come in! Doyle!

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:56.782
You need to get to safe ground.
Get to the stadium. Ditch those people.

01:16:56.866 --> 01:16:59.118
I'm not taking 'em.

01:17:12.173 --> 01:17:14.634
Flynn, come in.
Flynn, I know you can hear me.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:18.429
Fuck the Code Red, fuck the chain
of command. I need an extraction.

01:17:18.513 --> 01:17:20.973
You better fucking be there, cos we will be.

01:17:21.057 --> 01:17:24.143
You OK? Yeah?

01:17:24.227 --> 01:17:26.771
I bet you're tired, huh? Me, too.

01:17:26.854 --> 01:17:31.442
OK, I need you to help me, OK?
Help me with your sister. You got that?

01:17:31.526 --> 01:17:34.987
Come on. Gotta go. Gotta go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:03.057 --> 01:18:05.643
Gas! Get back! Get back!

01:18:05.726 --> 01:18:09.480
- Tammy, Andy, get in the car!
- It's gas! Run! Come on!

01:18:09.564 --> 01:18:13.359
Come on, get in the car! Get in the car!

01:18:13.442 --> 01:18:16.154
Come on! Get in! Get in!

01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:18.865
Get in, Andy!

01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:21.909
Go, go, go!

01:18:25.746 --> 01:18:27.874
Lock the doors!

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:31.544
Get the vents, get the vents.

01:19:14.045 --> 01:19:18.007
- It won't start!
- We'll be fine, all right? Just keep trying.

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:20.176
It won't start!

01:19:26.974 --> 01:19:30.520
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep trying. Keep trying!

01:19:30.603 --> 01:19:35.441
- It won't start! It won't fucking start!
- Fuck me!

01:19:37.276 --> 01:19:41.239
- It won't start!
- Put your foot on the clutch.

01:19:41.739 --> 01:19:47.370
All right. You pop the clutch when I tell you,
OK? You get them to the stadium. OK?

01:19:51.582 --> 01:19:54.210
Keep your head down.

01:19:59.465 --> 01:20:01.759
I'll meet you there.

01:20:01.843 --> 01:20:03.052
OK.

01:20:08.474 --> 01:20:10.184
- Doyle!
- Doyle!

01:20:21.654 --> 01:20:25.199
Pop it! Pop it!

01:20:27.368 --> 01:20:29.370
Go! Go!

01:20:30.371 --> 01:20:32.748
Go!

01:20:49.348 --> 01:20:51.976
Oh, my God...

01:21:13.206 --> 01:21:14.248
OK.

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:37.688
Fuck!

01:21:52.328 --> 01:21:54.038
- Scarlet!
- Fuck!

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:59.794
They're shooting at us!

01:22:15.476 --> 01:22:17.937
Hold on!

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:25.319
Shit.

01:22:32.201 --> 01:22:34.287
OK, let's go.

01:22:44.213 --> 01:22:47.216
Come on, through here, guys.

01:23:02.815 --> 01:23:05.109
Just hold onto the rails.

01:23:08.988 --> 01:23:11.073
Careful, guys.

01:23:14.785 --> 01:23:15.953
OK.

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:18.080
OK.

01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:21.083
It's OK. I can see. I can see.

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:24.253
Keep going down.

01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:30.218
OK.

01:23:30.301 --> 01:23:34.555
Just keep walking straight, guys.

01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:36.933
Holding against the wall.

01:23:37.016 --> 01:23:40.269
You're doing really well. You're doing great.

01:23:40.353 --> 01:23:43.147
OK, get back! Get back against the wall!

01:23:43.231 --> 01:23:45.608
OK. Good.

01:23:45.691 --> 01:23:50.321
Just stay close. Slightly to the right, Andy.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:54.283
It's OK. I can see. It's OK.
I've got the night sight on.

01:23:54.367 --> 01:23:59.205
You're doing great. Just hold... hold the rail.
Nice and slow down the stairs, OK?

01:23:59.288 --> 01:24:02.208
Stop! Stop! Stop right now!

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:04.710
OK, Tammy, to your left. Good.

01:24:04.794 --> 01:24:08.798
OK. Good girl. Just straight down.
Nice and slow. Slower.

01:24:09.507 --> 01:24:13.803
Stop! Stop, honey.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. All right?

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:17.723
Grab hold of the other railing, OK?
Go to your right.

01:24:17.807 --> 01:24:22.520
- Scarlet, I can't see anything!
- Go to your right. Go to your right.

01:24:22.603 --> 01:24:27.650
All right. Keep trying to skip... Just put your
leg far out in front of you, OK? Good girl.

01:24:27.733 --> 01:24:30.111
Hold onto the rail. Careful!

01:24:32.947 --> 01:24:35.283
Tammy!

01:24:35.366 --> 01:24:37.743
Andy!

01:24:37.827 --> 01:24:39.912
Where are you?

01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:47.170
Andy! Where are you? Andy!

01:24:47.253 --> 01:24:49.297
Answer me!

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.175
Where are you?

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.013
Tammy!

01:24:59.056 --> 01:25:02.018
- Where are you?
- Scarlet!

01:25:02.101 --> 01:25:06.189
- Tammy, I'm coming. I'm right here.
- Scarlet, I've lost Andy!

01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:09.275
- I'm right here.
- I've lost Andy.

01:25:09.358 --> 01:25:12.945
There we go.
Just come slowly towards me.

01:25:13.029 --> 01:25:15.156
I've lost Andy.

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:18.075
We'll find Andy.

01:25:26.626 --> 01:25:28.169
Scarlet!

01:25:39.722 --> 01:25:41.349
Andy!

01:25:41.432 --> 01:25:43.976
Where are you?

01:26:01.702 --> 01:26:04.789
Scarlet.

01:26:17.552 --> 01:26:19.178
Tammy?

01:26:19.262 --> 01:26:21.430
Tammy?

01:26:21.514 --> 01:26:23.349
Scarlet?

01:26:50.418 --> 01:26:51.961
No!

01:26:55.465 --> 01:26:56.591
Don!

01:27:55.525 --> 01:27:58.444
We stay together - whatever happens.

01:27:58.528 --> 01:28:01.030
- No!
- Andy!

01:28:01.113 --> 01:28:03.241
Andy, no!

01:28:03.324 --> 01:28:05.409
No! Andy!

01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:11.207
Andy! Andy!

01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:13.000
No!

01:28:13.209 --> 01:28:15.044
No!

01:28:15.127 --> 01:28:17.755
Andy!

01:28:47.702 --> 01:28:49.996
Tam, am I one of them?

01:29:01.632 --> 01:29:03.718
No.

01:29:08.347 --> 01:29:10.475
No, you're not.

01:30:13.663 --> 01:30:15.748
Stop!

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.336
Where's Doyle?

01:30:21.754 --> 01:30:24.048
Where's Doyle?

01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:33.558
It's just us.

01:30:47.321 --> 01:30:50.199
Come on.

01:30:50.283 --> 01:30:52.201
Get in. Come on.

01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:46.691
<i>Vous m'entendez?</i>

01:32:46.774 --> 01:32:49.026
Can you hear me?

01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:52.822
Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me?

01:32:52.905 --> 01:32:54.991
Is anybody there?

01:32:58.411 --> 01:33:00.872
We need your help.

01:33:00.955 --> 01:33:03.207
<i>Répondez. Répondez.</i>
