00:06.200 --> 00:10.520
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:14.960 --> 00:16.960
<i>After Gaybol got blocked,</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:20.040
<i>the players had yet another surprise.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:21.520
ALERT!

00:21.600 --> 00:22.480
Alert?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.240
Right when I'm off to bed?

00:24.320 --> 00:25.920
What is it now?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.520
"One more player
is going to leave <i>The Circle."</i>

00:29.600 --> 00:31.000
What?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.320
Don't put this weight on my shoulder,
please.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.880
"JP and Lorayne

00:36.960 --> 00:38.800
are the Influencers

00:38.880 --> 00:41.080
and will have to block one more player."

00:41.160 --> 00:42.280
My God!

00:42.360 --> 00:44.920
Christ Almighty!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.800
JP! I don't have any interaction with him!

00:47.880 --> 00:49.840
We have never even talked!

00:49.920 --> 00:52.080
How are we going to reach a consensus?

00:52.160 --> 00:53.840
I don't know what's on her mind.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.880
I hope Lolo protects me, man,
but I think I'm under fire.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.560
"JP and Lorayne,
proceed to the Blue Room

01:02.800 --> 01:04.680
to make your decision."

01:05.320 --> 01:08.240
Man, don't do this to me.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.120
"All other players

01:11.200 --> 01:15.120
must go to the At Risk chat."

01:15.200 --> 01:19.200
Let's see how it feels.
I'm not on the throne anymore.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.400
Let's make this decision and own it.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.080
Putting up with two blocks is no joke.

01:25.160 --> 01:28.160
It takes a very thick skin.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.320
What now, Brazil?

01:33.800 --> 01:34.960
<i>Now let's wait and see.</i>

01:35.520 --> 01:38.760
<i>It's up to JP and Lorayne.</i>

01:41.040 --> 01:42.760
The famous Blue Room.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.960
<i>Smell the power yet?</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:48.880
The ball...

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
is in my court.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.120
Here once more.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.880
So happy, so nervous.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.320
Ideally, we would go through everyone.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.480
I think we're on the opposite sides
of the game.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.320
Circle, message. Lorayne,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.040
firstly, congratulations...

02:17.400 --> 02:22.280
for getting here once again.
Big responsibility, huh?

02:22.360 --> 02:23.440
Send.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.200
Circle, message.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.080
Man, you have...

02:28.520 --> 02:30.920
no idea how big it is.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.800
#Nervous #Help.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.040
Send.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.520
Circle, message.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.000
Let's go through everyone.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.680
First off: Luma.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.520
I think she's incredible and brought
great energy to the game. Agree?

02:43.600 --> 02:44.480
Send.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.520
Circle, message.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.440
Sure, let's go through everyone.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.960
Man, she really is awesome...

02:53.040 --> 02:56.040
Man, I think Marina is simply amazing,

02:56.120 --> 02:59.320
mostly because I identify with her
and trust her a lot.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.600
What do you think? Send.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.280
It's clear that they're in sync.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.160
Let's do this. Circle, message.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.000
She really is one of the greatest players
in the game

03:11.080 --> 03:13.240
and she still has a lot to offer.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.400
Next is Duma.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.600
Dumaresq, in my opinion,
is one of the stars of <i>The Circle.</i>

03:18.680 --> 03:20.320
#IVoteStay.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.760
What about you?

03:22.360 --> 03:23.400
Send.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.360
One less off the list
I didn't want to block.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.960
Circle, message.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.200
Dude, he really came to slay.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.400
So, I vote to preserve him,
who's already proven his honesty.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.000
#HeStays.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.240
There you go. Duma stays.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.280
Apparently, we're on the right track,
right?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.640
Circle, message.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.080
Man,

03:50.640 --> 03:51.760
what about Lucas?

03:51.840 --> 03:55.040
I feel him very distant. #KeepsToHimself.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.320
Send.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.480
If he comes to Lucas' defense,
then he wants to kick Akel.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.880
Circle, message.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.960
Lucas is a nice guy, he's reserved,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.920
but he's letting himself loose
and he has a lot to grow.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.280
I know you may not like it,
since you two have something going on,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.440
but I changed my mind about Akel.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.960
He's trying too hard to be likable,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.960
he's on the fence

04:22.040 --> 04:26.000
and I don't know why
he stopped talking to me.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.360
"What do you have to say about that?"

04:30.240 --> 04:32.680
He's suspicious about Akel.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.200
Circle, message.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.200
Yeah, dude, I noticed it too.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.280
But I talked to him privately,
and he just respects everybody.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.320
Rationally, I see Akel playing,

04:44.400 --> 04:46.320
sticking his neck out a little!

04:46.400 --> 04:47.440
Exclamation mark.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.560
And letting himself loose,
something we haven't seen from Lucas.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.520
Send.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.160
That is to say,

04:56.240 --> 04:58.840
she would rather block Lucas, right?

04:58.920 --> 05:00.160
Circle, message.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.480
Well,

05:01.840 --> 05:05.320
I agree that Akel is a chill,
respectful guy.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.360
But unfortunately,
he doesn't deserve to stay.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.760
Do you agree?

05:11.280 --> 05:12.360
Send.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.520
I won't agree with you.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.760
You might be three times my size,
but I'm three times fiercer.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.760
The one who deserves to stay
is Akel, not Lucas.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.880
Why give someone
a chance to perhaps grow

05:24.960 --> 05:26.720
when someone else has already grown?

05:26.800 --> 05:28.640
Circle, message.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.480
Man, I disagree.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.640
"Emotional attachment aside,

05:33.960 --> 05:35.400
rationally speaking,

05:35.800 --> 05:37.600
Lucas is the one to block.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.760
He's been here from the get-go
and had plenty of time to step up."

05:44.320 --> 05:45.240
I disagree.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.000
I'm literally shaking right now.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.520
I'm shaking so much.
That's how nervous I am.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.560
<i>If things are hard for Influencers,</i>
<i>imagine for those being at risk.</i>

06:05.240 --> 06:08.480
"At Risk chat is now open."

06:10.080 --> 06:13.160
I'm not used to this.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.680
I'd rather be at risk
than not be anywhere.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.440
AT RISK CHAT

06:18.520 --> 06:19.960
Circle, message.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.400
I'm floored with this double elimination.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.640
#SoAtRisk.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.400
Insert tears of joy emoji.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.360
Send.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.160
Crying out loud.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.480
You're laughing because you're thick
as thieves with Lolo, dear.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.080
Circle, message.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.920
Marina, welcome to At Risk, bae.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.360
I wish we never met here.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.600
Circle, send.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.000
Man, he thinks I'm upset about being here.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.400
Although, in part, I am.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.720
Because I won't be able to...

06:53.160 --> 06:54.240
protect him.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.680
Oh, man.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.360
Circle, message.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.160
Here I am, trying to guess

07:01.240 --> 07:06.320
what Lorayne's and JP's decision will be.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.160
"They seem to have different perspectives
about the game.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.600
I'm really lost."

07:11.240 --> 07:14.000
In reality, I think Dumaresq is afraid.

07:14.080 --> 07:18.440
Yes. He was feeling all too comfortable

07:18.520 --> 07:19.720
and he saw that...

07:20.080 --> 07:22.400
he kind of fell from grace.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.360
Oh, yeah, baby. Not all roses, right?

07:25.440 --> 07:28.320
Careful with the air of superiority.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.120
Circle, message.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.360
Yikes, now we're in trouble.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.320
I believe Lucas is a nice fellow
and deserves a shot.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.640
I'm a very upfront guy and I like honesty,

07:51.720 --> 07:53.600
and I don't see that from Akel.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.320
Send.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.240
<i>The Circle </i>is on fire!

07:57.320 --> 07:58.960
Dude, that's the thing.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.160
I do think Lucas is a nice guy,

08:01.240 --> 08:04.120
but I believe Akel is honest!
Exclamation mark.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.240
Send.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.680
Unfortunately,

08:07.760 --> 08:09.440
we have a problem.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.520
I think you're letting your heart
speak louder than your brain.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.200
That's not justice.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.840
Finally, my decision is: Lucas stays.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.960
Send.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.800
Boy, for Christ's sake!

08:21.880 --> 08:23.560
Wake up!

08:23.640 --> 08:27.000
Do you really want to keep insisting?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.840
Circle, message.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.600
The same way...

08:31.760 --> 08:34.560
you're closer to Lucas...

08:35.440 --> 08:37.960
and believes in his potential,

08:38.040 --> 08:39.640
I believe in Akel.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.560
Send.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.160
She got attached to Akel,

08:45.240 --> 08:47.600
teamed up with him and is unbending.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.640
I won't compromise.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.640
That's who I am, man. And I can be here...

08:55.240 --> 08:57.400
all night long if he so desires.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.760
If he wants to argue all night, so be it.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.040
ALERT!

09:10.120 --> 09:11.920
-Alert!
-Holy!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.680
I better stand up.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.880
Hold on, dear heart.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.800
"The Influencers
have made their decision."

09:19.880 --> 09:21.760
That's it. The decision is made.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.640
Jeez, I beg you, Lolo.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.640
Seriously,
I don't want to imagine the worst.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.840
"All players must go to The Circle chat."

09:35.240 --> 09:37.360
Guys, I get so nervous.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.960
I was calm just now.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.200
Circle, message.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.200
It was an extremely hard decision.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.880
"So many doubts. Despite the heavy heart,

09:48.960 --> 09:51.520
reason and honesty have prevailed!"

09:51.600 --> 09:53.160
What does she mean?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.720
Circle, message.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.000
The player we've decided to block...

10:00.080 --> 10:02.760
"...failed to get involved with everyone."

10:02.840 --> 10:06.760
"They were too direct and succinct
with their messages."

10:06.840 --> 10:09.720
That I never was. Don't even start.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.760
I think she means Luma.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.320
I thought about it.
She didn't get involved.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.440
It's not Luma.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.840
It's her boyfriend.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.200
Akel.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.320
And Lucas.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.280
Circle, message.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.320
They lacked true emotion
when expressing themself.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.320
"Interaction is key

10:28.400 --> 10:29.840
on <i>The Circle..."</i>

10:29.920 --> 10:33.120
"...but this person failed
to fulfill this objective.

Girl, your riddle only gets harder.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.800
Circle, message.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.040
The person we decided to block is...

10:43.080 --> 10:45.080
The moment of truth. Good God.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.240
I'm so nervous!

10:50.080 --> 10:51.400
"The person is..."

10:54.000 --> 10:55.520
Tension!

11:01.200 --> 11:05.000
Let's see, Lolo. Don't disappoint me.
I'm ready to enjoy my Friday.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.440
Fuck this!

11:10.880 --> 11:11.920
Motherfucker!

11:12.440 --> 11:14.240
Shit, I'm safe!

11:14.320 --> 11:16.120
I don't give a damn. I'm safe!

11:18.040 --> 11:21.760
Gosh, that's it! Lucas was supposed to go.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.400
He's so lackluster.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.560
Luma continues.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.440
Lucas...

11:33.200 --> 11:34.080
Hashtag...

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800

11:36.280 --> 11:37.120
Send.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.560
<i>JP will call it in.</i>

11:42.640 --> 11:43.520
Okay.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.160
Damn!

11:47.360 --> 11:49.120
LUCAS WAS BLOCKED FROM <i>THE CIRCLE</i>

11:54.720 --> 11:56.960
BLOCKED

12:02.240 --> 12:03.360
I'm still in!

12:03.720 --> 12:05.800
Look at me dancing.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.160
That's it, Lorayne.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.200
Satisfied?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.080
What about Marina?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.600
How's she gonna feel?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.600
Shit, man...

12:23.320 --> 12:27.120
His friends could retaliate.
Beware, Lorayne.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.320
ALERT!

12:48.400 --> 12:50.240
Alert, you guys!

12:50.320 --> 12:52.880
Alert!

12:52.960 --> 12:55.520
This makes it what? The tenth today?

12:57.560 --> 12:58.600
Have mercy.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
"Before leaving,

13:00.400 --> 13:03.160
Lucas can meet one player in person."

13:04.000 --> 13:06.160
Oh, where are my clothes?

13:07.840 --> 13:10.960
Ooh, I wonder who Lucas is gonna pick?

13:12.480 --> 13:14.120
It can't be.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.600
Would he choose me?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.920
I wish he went to Lorayne
to have it out with her.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.600
But seeing how slippery she was...

13:22.680 --> 13:23.960
He accepted

13:24.040 --> 13:29.000
to let me share the responsibility

13:29.080 --> 13:31.440
for the decision to block Lucas.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.880
Now,

13:32.960 --> 13:34.240
it's time to...

13:38.720 --> 13:42.400
"Lucas is on his way
to one of your apartments."

13:42.920 --> 13:43.760
What now?

13:53.840 --> 13:54.960
Jesus Christ.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.120
What the hell?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.960
No way!

14:23.520 --> 14:25.160
Good evening, bae.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.040
No way, get out!

14:31.760 --> 14:33.040
Nice to meet you.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.600
Loma.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.000
-Loma?
-Half Loma, half Lucas.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.280
Girl, come here.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.120
Sit down!

14:51.200 --> 14:53.360
Tell me everything!

14:53.440 --> 14:54.720
Don't hit me.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.400
No, relax.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.520
-I couldn't go before...
-Oh, God...

14:58.600 --> 15:00.240
Talking to bae?

15:00.760 --> 15:03.120
-Talking to bae.
-No way!

15:03.200 --> 15:05.560
I wanted to see for myself

15:05.960 --> 15:08.680
if that energy you give off

15:09.080 --> 15:12.160
-really emanates...
-Goddamn!

15:12.240 --> 15:14.240
-Now let me tell you.
-If it's legit...

15:14.320 --> 15:15.920
I couldn't see,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.320
like, if it was a catfish or not.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.440
Everyone was telling me.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.000
And I was like, "No way, guys."
I'd say, "I don't know him.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.800
But I know he has a kind heart."
I even said that.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.440
But I do!

15:29.120 --> 15:31.120
But you aren't Lucas!

15:31.800 --> 15:33.480
And who do you think is catfish?

15:33.560 --> 15:36.000
At first, I thought JP was a catfish.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.360
I thought so too.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.320
Lo as well, but she's so like you.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.760
She is!

15:41.840 --> 15:44.240
So I stopped thinking she's a catfish.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.080
I feel like I've done my duty.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.480
That's how I feel.
With a clear conscience.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.560
Stop focusing
on whether people are catfish or not.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.000
Instead, focus on their game.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.080
I think women tend to unite,

15:57.440 --> 15:59.000
but they also tend to...

15:59.080 --> 16:00.520
stab each other's backs.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.520
You weren't bae.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.480
Kisses!

16:05.560 --> 16:08.520
We meet on the outside
after I win this show.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.560
Good luck, good night.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
-Bye.
-Kisses.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.080
I'll keep tabs on these men.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.600
Please do.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.920
I was so worried

16:25.000 --> 16:27.200
about meeting Marina.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.600
I wanted to talk to her face

16:29.680 --> 16:33.040
that I didn't mean
to mess with her feelings.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.880
What kind of friendships are those?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.840
It was automatic. Next thing I know,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.240
it was what it was.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.720
On one hand, I made a friend,

16:42.800 --> 16:45.640
on the other hand, I lost my bae.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.600
<i>You can't have everything, Marina.</i>

16:50.800 --> 16:53.480
Come here, Nelson. I need company.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.960
I feel so stupid.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.080
I shouldn't trust everybody.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.960
I don't have any idea
how Marina is feeling.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.560
I hope she took...

17:11.920 --> 17:15.400
my decision as rationally as possible.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.600
I don't care whether people
are catfishes or not anymore.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.320
I just want to know who's being truthful.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.200
#RAYSLAYS
WINNER

17:31.480 --> 17:34.920
First time being rated
and Luma ranks third.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.960
Feels good.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.240
I more than deserve a good rest.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.000
Good night, Circle.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.880
<i>As the days go by, the penny drops.</i>

17:47.960 --> 17:51.360
<i>This is no child play, everyone.</i>
<i>Wake up to the game.</i>

17:51.760 --> 17:54.960
Good morning, Circle of mine!

17:55.040 --> 17:59.320
I thought I wouldn't be here
to say good morning.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.960
Good morning, bedroom. Good morning, lamp.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.280
Seeing two fewer players on this screen

18:04.360 --> 18:07.240
is a lot of pressure.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.120
I'll stop playing with my heart
and start playing with this.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.760
Luma needs to watch how Marina reacts,
and catch her red-handed.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.320
She's not crazy to confront Lorayne.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.800
When I believe there's a cause to protect,
I protect it.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.560
I won't be bought.

18:26.640 --> 18:30.000
My strategy from now on

18:30.480 --> 18:32.880
is to get closer to the Northern girls,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.280
because they're skyrocketing.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.200
I have to start

18:37.280 --> 18:39.560
rolling up my sleeves.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.640
Paint my face, go to war,

18:42.720 --> 18:44.080
and shoot my arrows.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.560
<i>Strategies in place,</i>
<i>it's time to act on them.</i>

18:52.960 --> 18:55.760
I should start
a private chat with Marina...

18:56.880 --> 18:59.520
to maybe clear some things up

18:59.600 --> 19:01.720
and say that what happened yesterday

19:01.960 --> 19:03.600
wasn't something...

19:04.760 --> 19:05.920
that I proposed.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.280
Circle, open private chat with Marina.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.240
<i>Wow! Will he tell her everything?</i>

19:12.560 --> 19:15.800
"JP has invited you to a private chat."

19:15.880 --> 19:18.400
My heart is racing, I won't deny.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.600
Circle, open chat with JP.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.480
Circle, message.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.680
Good morning, Carioca girl.

19:26.760 --> 19:31.080
I wanted to take this opportunity
to tell you what happened yesterday.

19:31.160 --> 19:35.760
Our debate dragged on for a long time
and ended with no consensus.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.000
Eventually,
Lorayne decided on who to block,

19:39.080 --> 19:40.720
and I went with it

19:40.800 --> 19:42.720
because she's attached to Akel,

19:42.800 --> 19:44.960
although it went against my reasons.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.440
I wanted you to know that. Send.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.920
Hold on.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.520
My own sister...

19:55.760 --> 19:59.560
didn't give a fuck about me
or my feelings.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.920
In my opinion, I'm absolutely certain

20:04.000 --> 20:06.920
that Akel is using Lorayne.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
Circle, message.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.920
I gotta say I'm a bit upset now.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.160
I would never expect that decision
to be hers.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.400
"I would never expect that decision
to be hers."

20:20.960 --> 20:22.920
Look. This information is so important.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.880
She chose to block him anyway,

20:25.200 --> 20:26.920
stabbing her friend's back.

20:27.480 --> 20:31.640
I think she was completely disloyal
and played dirty.

20:31.720 --> 20:35.600
I so wanted to tell JP
that Lucas came here

20:35.680 --> 20:37.240
and also...

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
that <i>The Circle </i>is a lot more
than spotting catfishes.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.240
Circle, message.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.640
Regardless of all that,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.640
I had the pleasure to meet Lucas.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.240
And even though he wasn't Lucas,

20:51.320 --> 20:54.040
we had a fantastic chat

20:54.120 --> 20:58.040
that made me consider so many things.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.320
#ItWasAGirl. Send.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.480
"It was a girl."

21:05.600 --> 21:07.120
It never crossed my mind.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.880
She knew how to play a guy.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.800
On <i>The Circle, </i>brother,
everything can change.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.480
Circle, message.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.200
I got to say
this news has taken me aback.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.720
Let's be wiser and more attentive.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.640
#IWantYouByMySide, #TheGoodTeam.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.040
Oh, that's so cute!

21:30.120 --> 21:33.640
God, JP,
why didn't you talk to me earlier?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.160
Circle, message.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.720
That's a side of JP
I hadn't gotten to known before.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.880
#CountOnMe.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.960
#HonestyAboveAllElse.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.320
Send.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.240
Amen, my dear.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.600
I want you by my side.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.840
I dare say a probable final will be...

21:54.360 --> 21:55.560
me,

21:55.640 --> 21:56.600
Dumaresq

21:56.680 --> 21:57.760
and Marina.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.120
Now,

22:00.200 --> 22:02.880
I hope Lo forgives me,

22:02.960 --> 22:05.440
but Akel needs to be blocked.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.320
Let the games begin.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.400
<i>Unlike Lorayne,</i>
<i>Marina won't cover for Akel.</i>

22:23.960 --> 22:27.200
<i>Akel, I'm telling you!</i>
<i>Wake up to the game, man!</i>

22:28.640 --> 22:30.960
"The feed has been updated."

22:31.040 --> 22:32.440
God.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.000
"The feed has been updated."

22:34.080 --> 22:36.040
Leave these dishes for later.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.400
Let's see what the feed brings us.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.960
Tell me right now. What is it?

22:41.520 --> 22:43.160
Circle, open the feed.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.560
NEWSFEED

22:44.640 --> 22:48.120
"Before leaving, Gaybol left a message."

22:48.200 --> 22:50.400
No way!

22:53.920 --> 22:56.360
Gosh, I so hope he was a catfish.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.120
That's the moment

22:58.200 --> 23:02.120
when I either feel guilty

23:02.200 --> 23:05.520
or I go like, "There!"

23:06.480 --> 23:10.760
Circle, play Gaybol's video.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.760
My God.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.680
That's so insane.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.160
Let's see.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.640
My God!

23:21.720 --> 23:23.600
What's up, <i>The Circle?</i>

23:23.680 --> 23:27.160
<i>I'm Gaybol, nice to meet you.</i>
<i>I've got something to say.</i>

23:27.240 --> 23:28.920
That's actually him. Dang.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.600
Wow, I thought Gaybol was a kid.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.240
He's so sexy, guys!

23:35.320 --> 23:37.720
<i>Some girls are playing nice,</i>

23:37.800 --> 23:41.880
<i>some guys are trying to pass</i>
<i>as everyone's friends,</i>

23:41.960 --> 23:44.120
but things aren't what it looks like.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.440
He threw me some shade. Didn't he?

23:47.520 --> 23:49.520
The ball is already rolling.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.480
<i>People are already playing,</i>

23:51.560 --> 23:54.000
<i>so, open your eyes, folks.</i>

23:54.080 --> 23:55.320
Thanks for the tip.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.080
That's Gaybol's message.
Cheers and good luck.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.920
Yeah, fam!

24:02.920 --> 24:05.240
Good talk, my man.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.560
Should Luma be careful with JP?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.120
With everyone!

24:09.200 --> 24:12.400
Girl playing nice? Lorayne!

24:12.480 --> 24:15.680
Man, you have no idea.
I really am a nice girl.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.560
He was referring to me.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.360
"A guy trying to pass
as everyone's friend."

24:21.280 --> 24:22.480
Who's two-faced?

24:22.920 --> 24:25.920
Thanks for all the hints.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.440
Am I playing nice? I'm not.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.040

24:32.120 --> 24:34.760
Gosh, it keeps updating!

24:34.840 --> 24:36.440
That's how I like it, Circle.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.320

24:47.640 --> 24:50.160

Loma.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.920
what I claimed to be.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.960
Damn!

25:02.040 --> 25:03.560
Slow down with the catfish hunt.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.120
<i>Instead, you should ask yourself,</i>

25:06.200 --> 25:08.280
<i>"Is the person who I trust</i>

25:08.720 --> 25:09.800
<i>playing fair with me?"</i>

from under you.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.880
Goddamn, I'm floored!

25:14.960 --> 25:18.720
Bae, you can do this.
I'm with you, my Carioca.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.440
I'll always be with you, Lucas.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.080
I got this.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.680
I got this.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.520
See? A catfish can be an ally.
No need to--

25:29.600 --> 25:32.440
But I don't see this catfish hunt.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.560
It's a legitimate reason to get blocked.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.000
-To get the ax.
-Oh, right.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.880
That message she left

25:37.960 --> 25:39.840
will serve as motivation

25:39.920 --> 25:43.200
for us to leave aside this matter...

25:43.800 --> 25:44.920
of hunting catfishes.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.080
The catfish hunt does exist, as it should.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.920
-Paloma...
-I loved Paloma.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.040
She's so much better.
A thousand times better than Lucas.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.000
To pretend to be a man

25:55.080 --> 25:57.000
who goes to festivals, girl?

25:57.080 --> 25:59.040
Quit being silly, sis.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.040
Marina must be so upset.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.600
I think she will understand
it was the right choice.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.560
<i>Yeah, but back when you chose Lucas,</i>
<i>he was still your friend's bae, right?</i>

26:09.640 --> 26:11.440

26:18.080 --> 26:20.200
As per usual,

26:20.280 --> 26:24.120
I wanted so bad

26:43.560 --> 26:47.080
Is everyone shocked
about these revelations?

26:47.760 --> 26:49.840
I want to know what they're thinking.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.000
Especially what Marina
is thinking about it. God help me.

Good morning, my girls!

27:06.600 --> 27:10.200
I would like to say something!

27:10.840 --> 27:15.600
We are the majority!

27:20.000 --> 27:21.240
<i>Are you sure?</i>

27:21.760 --> 27:23.920
Yes, guys, we are the majority.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.640
But little does it matter
to be the majority...

27:27.880 --> 27:29.680

27:29.760 --> 27:31.040
Circle, message.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.400
Good morning, girls.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.080
What did you think of the messages?

27:36.680 --> 27:40.480
I have several questions in my mind.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.800
#Life'sCircle. Send.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.640
Yo, I'm dumbfounded by that reveal.

Scared emoji. Send.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.800
You're not dumbfounded, Lo.
Let's be real about it.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.040
I'd like it so much if she came to me

27:58.120 --> 28:01.320
and said, "Sis, how are you feeling?"
Or something of the like.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.480
But she kind of gave a shit.

Circle, message.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.560
Lorayne, girl,
I suspected that Lucas was a catfish...

28:09.640 --> 28:12.720
"...but, God willing,
you'll eventually wed Akel."

28:12.800 --> 28:14.800
What's up with the wedding joke?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.000
Give it a break.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.480
Circle, message.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.360
I gotta say I liked Loma

28:20.440 --> 28:22.040

Loma is a fantastic person.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.640
She was a sharp observer.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.240
After we talked, I must say I woke up.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.320

28:39.200 --> 28:41.560
Loma left a lot of tips...

28:42.120 --> 28:44.680
for Marina, that much I know.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.480
So, he visited Marina.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.560
Well, I think Lucas got into Marina's head

28:50.640 --> 28:53.920
and now she must be thinking
I'm being two-faced.

Circle, message.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.000
We did try to be fair and honest.

Marina, sis,
it didn't work out with Lucas,

29:01.120 --> 29:03.240
but perhaps it does with Loma?

My heart says
I shouldn't pressure Lorayne,

29:12.840 --> 29:16.120
my brain says otherwise. Circle, message.

29:16.200 --> 29:19.520
Lorayne, girl, you've said it.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.600

29:37.000 --> 29:39.280
great relief.

Circle, message.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.680
Right. After the group Playmakers,

29:45.760 --> 29:47.480
created by the guys,

29:48.000 --> 29:52.400
I noticed they're protecting each other.

See?

30:09.920 --> 30:10.960
Write it down.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.680
If she's talking about Akel...

30:17.240 --> 30:19.680
Love, you're contradicting yourself.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.200
Look,

30:21.880 --> 30:24.480
if you didn't see JP protecting him,

30:25.480 --> 30:29.120
why did you say
both of you agreed on who to block?

30:29.200 --> 30:30.960
Gosh...

30:31.520 --> 30:35.120
Either she's two-faced
or she's playing dumb. It can't be.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.160
I'll throw Lorayne some shade.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.520
The way I see it,
Akel is being super manipulative,

30:57.680 --> 31:00.280
Damn, we have a new target.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.960
That's the thing, sis. I like him a lot,

31:04.040 --> 31:08.080
but what JP said
definitely had some weight.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.400
And we gotta be on the lookout.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.160
Pay attention!

31:12.240 --> 31:13.960
The victims now

31:14.040 --> 31:16.880

33:01.400 --> 33:04.240
The decision to block Lucas/Loma

33:04.600 --> 33:07.360
was taken by Lorayne against my will...

33:07.440 --> 33:09.840
"...because of her feelings towards Akel."

33:10.720 --> 33:12.640
So he wanted to block Akel.

He's playing dirty.

37:00.520 --> 37:05.280
Speaking of it,
we're always paired up, huh?

37:05.640 --> 37:06.600
Send.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.120
Circle, message.

37:09.200 --> 37:13.600
But what do you think of the girls?
Do you trust them completely?

37:13.680 --> 37:16.480
#TalkToMe. Send.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.440
Oh, my God.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.920
Circle, message. Marina,

37:23.000 --> 37:26.360
I trust pretty much all of them. You?

37:26.680 --> 37:27.800
Send.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.320
"I trust pretty much all of them."

37:32.400 --> 37:35.800
Love, eventually you're gonna have
to choose between two.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.720
Then what?

37:37.800 --> 37:41.000
Marina is already thinking...

37:42.080 --> 37:43.280
about the future.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.360
Will it be...

37:46.440 --> 37:50.120
me, Marina and Lorayne?

37:50.200 --> 37:52.880
Or maybe me, Luma and Ray?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.480
He wants me to spill it.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.560
Circle, message.

37:57.640 --> 38:01.880
Right now, what worries me the most
is my sister Lorayne.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.360
I want her to be more assertive
in regards to Akel.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.280
Send.

38:06.960 --> 38:10.280
Man, now I've either screwed it all up...

38:11.720 --> 38:12.960
or I...

38:13.600 --> 38:14.840
killed it.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.600
"I want her to be more assertive
in regards to Akel."

38:19.680 --> 38:21.800
Damn!

38:21.880 --> 38:25.080
No space for love affairs.
The affairs that we see here

38:25.160 --> 38:29.360
are indeed fake affairs
meant to keep people on the game.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.920
Circle, message.

38:31.240 --> 38:35.200
Marina, I feel that our bond is stronger

38:35.280 --> 38:37.080
than hers with Akel.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.360
And I believe that between She Fights
and him,

38:41.440 --> 38:45.720
it would be smarter of her
to stay on our side.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.240
#ChillOut.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.880
That's true.
If she runs to stay with Akel, honey...

38:52.600 --> 38:54.440
We'll have to aim for somebody.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.120
That somebody will be one of the boys.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.160
Which of the boys is more fragile?
Akel is.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.920
Circle, message. Dumaresq,

39:04.000 --> 39:08.160
I relate so much with you
because of your honesty,

39:08.240 --> 39:10.200
and I needed to get it out of my chest.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.800
I trust your words.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.280
There's still so much water
to go under the bridge, right?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.400
#Let'sDoThis.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.480
Send.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.000
"#Let'sDoThis." Right on, Marina.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.480
Chill out, woman. For God's sake.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.600
Were you really thinking
these affairs were for real?

39:29.680 --> 39:31.880
I expected more from this chat.

39:31.960 --> 39:36.960
It's so childish to be like,
"Let's unite and kick out the boys."

39:37.560 --> 39:39.000
I don't like it.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.080
<i>Dang, friends drifting apart.</i>

39:49.280 --> 39:51.360
<i>So healthy, JP!</i>

39:51.440 --> 39:54.640
Lolo, Dumaresq and Marina are so strong.
I need to hear...

39:55.160 --> 39:58.400
from JP what happened yesterday
in their argument,

39:58.480 --> 40:00.880
in the Influencer talk with Lolo.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.120
Circle, open chat with JP.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.400
Cool!

40:08.480 --> 40:10.800
"Akel has invited you to a private chat."

40:10.880 --> 40:13.120
Open chat with Akel.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.480
Circle, message.

40:14.560 --> 40:19.120
Yo, JP. Everything cool?
Two question marks.

40:19.200 --> 40:22.520
Surprised with Lucas video,
or did you expect it as well?

40:22.600 --> 40:23.640
Circle, send.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.600
What's up, man? I'm chill. I know, right?

40:27.680 --> 40:29.880
I never expected Lucas to be Loma.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.200
LOL. Send.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.680
Circle, message.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.280
Was it hard to decide?

40:36.440 --> 40:40.680
I gotta be direct. It's an important chat,
I shouldn't beat around the bush.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.440
Circle, message.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.080
I'm surprised
that you're finally reaching out.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.000
Send.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.880
Message. In the beginning,
I saw you as my brother,

40:53.960 --> 40:57.280
but since then, I've been wondering
about your attitude change.

40:57.360 --> 41:01.280
I thought something had happened
because you quit interacting with me.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.800
As for the remaining players,
I have no reservations.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.440
"We were between you and Lucas."

41:11.560 --> 41:12.600
He destroyed me.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.200
Perhaps he took me for a gullible kid.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.600
I wasn't expecting that.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.240
I thought JP and I were in good terms.

41:22.320 --> 41:25.600
Circle, message. Well, @JP,

41:25.680 --> 41:28.480
I always felt
like we related to each other

41:28.560 --> 41:30.400
because of our similar lifestyles...

41:30.480 --> 41:34.120
"...and playbook.
I thought we had each other's backs."

41:34.200 --> 41:35.320
Unfortunately,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.960
you have been acting different, bro.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.520
You gotta take a stance.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.960
You can't be on the fence,
trying to please everyone.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.240
Circle, message.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.640
Well, bro, we do have each other's backs,

41:47.720 --> 41:51.560
I just think
you should make a clearer stand.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.960
"Just trying to help a brother out.
#IGotchu."

41:54.040 --> 41:57.040
I mean, I have never seen you give
any kind of opinion.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.520
He never reached out.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.440
Now that I'm at the top
as an Influencer,

42:02.120 --> 42:03.640
guess who wants to be friends.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.640
If it was between Lucas and I,
then I'm next on the chopping block.

42:08.720 --> 42:12.040
If I were him, I would side with me.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.400
I don't see him as close
to Dumaresq, Marina and Lolo

42:15.480 --> 42:17.480
as they are between the three of them.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.920
Circle, message.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.840
Count on me for whatever you need.

42:20.920 --> 42:24.320
#StayStrong, #CoolAsACucumber.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.680
Send. Done.
It's better to cut the whining.

42:27.760 --> 42:28.680
I felt that...

42:28.760 --> 42:32.320
he's kind of desperate
to establish an alliance.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.520
Oh, well.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.720
He waited until things got out of hand
to act upon it.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.200
Who knows if you'll ever be
at the top again.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.280
Slow down, cowboy.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.720
Power is ephemeral.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.360
<i>On the one hand, Akel is right.</i>

42:51.440 --> 42:53.640
<i>Nothing ever lasts forever.</i>

42:53.720 --> 42:56.280
<i>But how about we clear the air?</i>

42:56.720 --> 43:00.320
My good people,
the last few days have been so tense.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.400
I wanted so much to propose

43:02.480 --> 43:06.200
that we stretch a little,
and I'll minister the class personally.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.640
Circle,

43:07.720 --> 43:09.360
create chat...

43:09.880 --> 43:11.440

43:12.720 --> 43:14.680
"Dumaresq has invited you to the chat..."

43:14.760 --> 43:15.920
"DumaFit".

43:16.000 --> 43:17.440
I love it!

43:17.520 --> 43:19.320
He is obsessed with group chats.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.320
Circle, open Dumaresq's group chat.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.720
Christ, so many people.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.240

43:26.320 --> 43:30.240

to minister a stretching class."

43:34.680 --> 43:36.160
"Let's go, workout buddies?"

43:37.600 --> 43:39.000
What the heck?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.520
I'll push this table away
to make me some room.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.920
First move!

43:44.000 --> 43:47.480
"I can't see beer
and not want to drink it."

43:49.560 --> 43:52.920
"Head to one side, arm to the other."

43:53.000 --> 43:55.240
"Grabbing your elbow with your hands."

43:58.400 --> 43:59.640
Like this?

43:59.720 --> 44:02.800
Beer's there,
head points to the other side.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.560
I want beer.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.040
I want beer.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.200
Like this, right?

44:08.280 --> 44:11.600
Circle, message. Second move!

44:11.680 --> 44:13.960
Pre-hair whipping.

44:14.040 --> 44:17.000
"Stretch your neck up and down."

44:17.080 --> 44:19.400
"One side, then the other."

44:19.480 --> 44:21.760
-"One side..."
-Pulling your shoulder lightly.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.000

44:25.720 --> 44:27.480
Third move.

44:27.880 --> 44:31.200
I farted, but no one must know.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.440
"Take a deep breath."

44:33.520 --> 44:34.880
"And exhale slowly."

44:34.960 --> 44:36.800
"Repeat at least five times.

#Relax, #Grateful."
