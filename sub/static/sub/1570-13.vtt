00:35.034 --> 00:37.735
The TV is mine, boys.
<i>Downton Abbey is on</i>

00:37.770 --> 00:40.071
and I intend to see if
Lord Grantham will be able

00:40.105 --> 00:42.140
to modernize his
accounting practices.

00:42.174 --> 00:45.009
Dad, just hold on, we're
on the last level of the game.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.378
What is this game?

00:47.413 --> 00:49.981
You're just throwing stuff
at old-timey ladies.

00:50.015 --> 00:52.383
You go back in time and
have to find Hitler's mom

00:52.418 --> 00:53.885
when she was pregnant with him

00:53.919 --> 00:55.653
and somehow induce
a miscarriage.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.956
It's called
<i>Nazi Natal Nightmare.</i>

01:01.060 --> 01:02.393
Keep tossing!

01:02.428 --> 01:03.628
She's heading for the hospital

01:03.629 --> 01:05.396
to give birth, but
it's not too late!

01:05.431 --> 01:07.966
We need to aim for the soft spot
on baby Hitler's head.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.400
One direct hit there,

01:09.435 --> 01:11.569
and we can still prevent
the Holocaust.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.408
You killed my grandparents,
you bastard!

01:17.443 --> 01:19.510
I'm tired of you kids
always being indoors

01:19.545 --> 01:20.845
and playing video games.

01:20.879 --> 01:22.347
Play outside for a change.

01:22.381 --> 01:25.049
But we already completed,
<i>Outside.</i>

01:25.084 --> 01:28.353
And <i>Outside II:</i>
<i>Without a Sweater.</i>

01:28.387 --> 01:30.088
Have you kids ever spent
a day outside

01:30.122 --> 01:33.191
just throwing actual rocks
with your actual arms?

01:33.225 --> 01:34.659
Nah.
No, no.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.628
Hmm.
No. I've heard of rocks.

01:36.662 --> 01:38.296
No. No. No.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.431
Have any of you ever held
an actual nudie magazine

01:40.466 --> 01:41.799
that your friend, Mark,

01:41.834 --> 01:43.434
pulled out of the Dumpster
at church?

01:43.469 --> 01:45.837
Oh, no, haven't done that, no.
No.

01:45.871 --> 01:47.639
And I bet you've never
felt the rush

01:47.673 --> 01:50.608
of stumbling across a dead body
while roaming through the woods.

01:50.643 --> 01:51.776
No, Papa.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.177
Well, I have.

01:53.212 --> 01:54.312
And all that real-life living

01:54.346 --> 01:55.847
made me the man I am today.

01:55.881 --> 01:57.482
I didn't need video games.

01:57.516 --> 02:00.218
I invented my own games,
like rock fight.

02:00.252 --> 02:02.553
Not sure
you invented rock fights.

02:02.588 --> 02:03.821
I did invent it!

02:03.856 --> 02:04.989
And I was the champion.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.391
I defeated the guy
who taught me.

02:06.425 --> 02:08.226
Dad, we make our own games, too.

02:08.259 --> 02:10.127
That game you
so rudely shut off,

02:10.162 --> 02:12.864
that was an existing
Franco-Prussian war game

02:12.898 --> 02:15.233
we jzushed up with code
we wrote ourselves.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.935
Steve, the words you just
strung together devastate me.

02:17.970 --> 02:20.204
Go outside and play now!

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.548 --> 02:31.549
Oh, for God's sake.

02:37.489 --> 02:39.857
Dad, we were FaceTiming
with each other.

02:39.892 --> 02:42.326
You really have to do
something about your dad.

02:42.361 --> 02:44.295
Who said that?
Identify yourself.

02:45.297 --> 02:46.731
Stan, what's going on?

02:46.765 --> 02:48.599
These kids are wasting
their childhoods

02:48.634 --> 02:50.234
on their video games
and phones.

02:50.269 --> 02:52.770
So this weekend,
I'm taking them to the woods

02:52.805 --> 02:55.273
so they can have the kind
of adventures I had as a kid.

02:55.307 --> 02:56.941
Absolutely not.

02:56.975 --> 02:58.676
Steve can't handle the woods.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.279
He wears Velcro laces, Stan.

03:01.313 --> 03:04.382
Velcro, like an infant.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.517
But, Mom... I mean Francine!

03:06.552 --> 03:08.119
Forget it, Stan.

03:08.153 --> 03:10.354
You will not take
our boy into the woods

03:10.389 --> 03:12.990
or you're grounded!
I mean, cut off from sex.

03:13.025 --> 03:15.693
Promise me you won't
take him, Stan.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.730
All right, I promise, Francine.

03:19.765 --> 03:21.532
Will Stan keep his promise?

03:21.567 --> 03:23.408
Will Steve and the boys
get their phones fixed?

03:23.435 --> 03:24.669
Will they...?

03:24.703 --> 03:26.504
Get in the house, Randy!

03:31.176 --> 03:32.844
Have you ever looked up
at the night sky

03:32.878 --> 03:35.346
and thought,
"I'd like to get in on that"?

03:35.380 --> 03:37.515
At the International
Star Registry,

03:37.549 --> 03:40.585
you can actually
purchase your own star.

03:40.619 --> 03:43.154
I bought one for my wife
on our anniversary.

03:43.188 --> 03:45.923
I bought one for myself
when I got passed over at work.

03:45.958 --> 03:48.926
I haven't bought one yet,
but I'm real close.

03:48.961 --> 03:50.795
Ha! What a bunch of suckers.

03:50.829 --> 03:52.330
That's as stupid
as buying a goat

03:52.364 --> 03:53.998
for a poor family in Africa.

03:54.032 --> 03:55.867
Roger, you know every year

03:55.901 --> 03:58.136
I buy a goat for a
poor family in Africa.

03:58.170 --> 04:01.038
Oh, right, you're the sucker
that actually cares about stuff.

04:01.073 --> 04:02.674
And by the way,
you're wasting your money

04:02.708 --> 04:04.041
sending a goat over there.

04:04.076 --> 04:06.377
You could have shipped
Jim Breuer for half the cost.

04:06.411 --> 04:09.447
American Dad!
<i>Remembers Jim Breuer.</i>

04:10.716 --> 04:13.384
You know what, I am
sick of you pretending

04:13.418 --> 04:14.919
you don't care about anything

04:14.953 --> 04:17.221
and making fun of
those of us who do.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.593
Sure, make another joke.

04:22.628 --> 04:25.062
But deep down, I know
you care about something,

04:25.097 --> 04:26.798
and I'm gonna find out what.

04:26.832 --> 04:28.566
Sounds like a great use
of your time,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.668
but three things you might
want to deal with first:

04:30.702 --> 04:32.870
mustache, eyebrows...

04:32.905 --> 04:35.640
mustache.

04:39.711 --> 04:41.913
Steve's never gonna have
the type of childhood I had.

04:41.947 --> 04:43.147
It's sad.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.149
Kids today!

04:45.184 --> 04:46.584
When I was a lad,

04:46.618 --> 04:48.853
I never saw the point
of playing inside.

04:48.887 --> 04:52.123
Until I was sent
to an all-boy's boarding school.

04:52.157 --> 04:54.659
Then my tune changed.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.761
What I'd love to do
is drop those kids

04:56.795 --> 04:58.162
in the middle of the forest,

04:58.197 --> 04:59.931
make them have
some real experiences,

04:59.965 --> 05:02.166
like wolves' kids do.

05:02.234 --> 05:05.536
Sir, these cucumber sandwiches
are divine,

05:05.571 --> 05:07.505
but when did the CIA
get a tearoom?

05:07.539 --> 05:10.474
At the same time
that we got a yacht!

05:13.879 --> 05:15.179
Whoa!
What the hell?!

05:15.214 --> 05:16.314
Where are we?

05:16.348 --> 05:18.216
I'll tell you where we are.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.651
At the top of an
active volcano!

05:21.854 --> 05:23.621
What was in that tea?

05:23.655 --> 05:25.122
A very light opiate,

05:25.157 --> 05:27.825
but that has nothing to do with
the visions you're seeing.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.393
Follow me.

05:31.997 --> 05:35.466
This control room is able
to calibrate force fields

05:35.500 --> 05:37.735
so strong that
the holographic images

05:37.769 --> 05:40.605
projected onto them feel real
to the touch.

05:40.639 --> 05:42.540
Ah! So it works like
the holodeck.

05:42.574 --> 05:44.342
The what now?
From <i>Star Trek.</i>

05:44.376 --> 05:47.345
Some of us spent the late '80s
and early '90s

05:47.379 --> 05:49.013
getting laid, Smith.

05:49.047 --> 05:52.683
In any event, I call this room
the hologram deck.

05:52.718 --> 05:54.852
So it can recreate
any environment?

05:54.887 --> 05:58.456
Well, any environment stored
in our bank of human memories.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.324
Wait, you recorded our memories?

06:00.359 --> 06:03.661
Yes, remember those headphones
you got for Christmas?

06:03.695 --> 06:05.696
They weren't headphones.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.231
Those things never worked.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.166
Actually, they worked perfectly.

06:09.201 --> 06:11.535
Here's one of mine.
Have a look.

06:13.038 --> 06:15.873
Oh, Avery,
you're as tight as the fabric

06:15.908 --> 06:17.742
on a reupholstered davenport.

06:17.776 --> 06:20.811
Not for long, I wasn't.

06:20.846 --> 06:24.749
This was the day I started
to like playing inside.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.951
Playing inside, eh?

06:26.985 --> 06:28.152
Wait a minute.

06:28.186 --> 06:30.488
So this holodeck
could simulate the woods

06:30.522 --> 06:32.056
I played in as a child?

06:32.090 --> 06:34.125
Of course it can, Smith,

06:34.159 --> 06:38.162
but you do know we're seconds
away from a sex scene, right?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.801
This one's going straight
to Instagram.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.570
Oh, Klaus already liked it.

06:46.605 --> 06:47.738
Thanks, Klaus!

06:47.773 --> 06:49.240
No, thank you!

06:49.274 --> 06:50.474
Hey, Roger.

06:50.509 --> 06:52.710
I decided to buy
a little present for myself.

06:52.744 --> 06:54.545
You bought a star.

06:54.579 --> 06:55.846
Hilarious.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.381
Not just any star.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.582
Look closer.

06:58.617 --> 07:01.452
X3Q8F-3X?

07:01.486 --> 07:04.588
That's-that's my
home planet's sun.

07:04.623 --> 07:06.724
And I own the deed.
It's mine.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.659
I guess that makes me
your leader.

07:08.694 --> 07:12.430
Yeah, it bothers
you, doesn't it?

07:12.464 --> 07:15.132
Maybe I found
something you care about.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.635
It's a piece of paper that
means absolutely nothing.

07:17.669 --> 07:19.737
I don't care.
I don't care at all.

07:19.771 --> 07:21.172
Oh, then you won't care

07:21.206 --> 07:23.407
if I name the star
after something you hate.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.309
You could name it
Jessica Seinfeld,

07:25.344 --> 07:26.477
for all I care.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.479
Maybe I will.

07:28.513 --> 07:31.816
Oh, my God,
why did I put that in her head?

07:36.355 --> 07:38.089
Oh, no! Her water broke.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.457
We're running out of time!

07:39.491 --> 07:40.725
Hit her with everything!

07:40.759 --> 07:42.560
Toshi, use your mega-hanger!

07:50.869 --> 07:54.572
I know he's gonna be a monster,
but I do love babies.

07:54.606 --> 07:57.041
Boys, I'm sorry I was
a jerk the other day.

07:57.075 --> 07:58.676
I'd like to make it up to you.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.378
I'm taking you all
to Gamer Town

08:00.412 --> 08:02.279
to buy you whatever
games you want.

08:03.648 --> 08:05.516
I also got you guys
these cheeseburgers.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.618
Can't buy video games
on an empty stomach.

08:07.652 --> 08:09.920
Well, I guess today
is gonna be my cheat day.

08:09.955 --> 08:11.389
Thanks, Dad.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.557
You really came around on thi...

08:15.861 --> 08:18.029
Mine's not working.

08:18.063 --> 08:19.430
Have three more.

08:24.357 --> 08:26.125
Oh, man.

08:26.159 --> 08:29.161
Your dad must have roofied
those hamburgers.

08:29.196 --> 08:31.263
Where the hell are we?

08:31.298 --> 08:32.798
You're in the forest,

08:32.832 --> 08:34.933
but not the actual forest,

08:34.967 --> 08:38.070
so technically I kept my promise
to Francine.

08:38.104 --> 08:40.239
My first promise.

08:40.273 --> 08:42.541
I can't believe my
dad ditched us here.

08:46.146 --> 08:48.914
Guys, how long do you think
we can last out here?

08:48.949 --> 08:50.916
I don't know,
but if we're gonna die,

08:50.951 --> 08:52.618
I'm not going out a virgin.

08:53.987 --> 08:56.589
Well, if trees count,
then I'm Wilt Chamberlain.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.791
Come on, you guys,
don't just stand there.

08:58.825 --> 09:00.726
Explore the forest,
have adventures.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.027
Hmm.

09:02.062 --> 09:03.829
Turning down the temperature

09:03.864 --> 09:05.464
ought to get them moving.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.902
Wow, it-it's
getting chilly.

09:09.936 --> 09:11.509
Does anyone know
how to build a fire?

09:11.550 --> 09:14.852
I know a fire-making spell
from <i>Harry Potter.</i>

09:14.887 --> 09:17.789
We need to climb into someone's
abdomen for warmth.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.491
Everyone whose name
isn't Barry, meeting.

09:20.526 --> 09:21.893
Wait, I got a better idea.

09:21.927 --> 09:24.362
Maybe we should spoon
for warmth.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.533
I wish there was
movie we could watch.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.101
A movie?!

09:30.135 --> 09:31.502
You're in the middle
of the forest!

09:31.537 --> 09:32.817
All you're doing
is lying around!

09:32.838 --> 09:34.305
That's it,

09:34.340 --> 09:36.341
this train's moving
out of the station right now!

09:38.544 --> 09:40.011
Toshi, you're out of sync.

09:40.045 --> 09:41.546
Can you please
bring your breath

09:41.580 --> 09:42.947
into alignment
with the rest of us?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.687
Oh, my God! A bear!

09:49.722 --> 09:50.855
Protect me!

09:50.889 --> 09:53.024
I look the most
like a honey pot!

10:01.900 --> 10:03.901
Roger, what are you doing?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.903
Who are you to wake up
and question me?

10:05.938 --> 10:08.439
You wouldn't happen to be
looking for this, would you?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.975
Look, I'll give you
the certificate, Roger.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.945
You just have to admit
you care about it.

10:13.979 --> 10:16.581
This is not the thing
I'm looking for.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.750
Are-are you trying to
use the Force on me?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.685
You know that's
make-believe, right?

10:20.719 --> 10:21.986
So's <i>Rocky!</i>

10:22.021 --> 10:23.621
Ow!
Sorry!

10:25.658 --> 10:27.458
I'm getting kind of scared.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.761
What happens if we never find
our way home?

10:30.104 --> 10:32.872
_

10:33.232 --> 10:34.866
Guys, relax.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.267
My dad can be a jerk,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.436
but he's not gonna let us die
out in the forest.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.004
He's just trying
to teach us a lesson.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.205
I'm hungry.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.807
Are you sure you're
not just tired?

10:42.841 --> 10:43.841
I don't know!

10:43.876 --> 10:45.910
All my feelings
feel like hungry!

10:45.944 --> 10:49.047
Well, let's try to find
something that we can eat.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.117
Well, my plan seems
to be working.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.186
Now if I push off just right,

10:55.220 --> 10:57.689
it should carry me all the way
to the hot cocoa machine.

10:58.857 --> 11:02.060
I'm Sandra Bullock!

11:03.095 --> 11:04.896
Ow!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.833
Guys! Come quick!

11:08.867 --> 11:10.768
Look what I just knocked open.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.036
Oh, my God!

11:12.071 --> 11:13.304
Somebody killed a robot

11:13.339 --> 11:14.772
and buried it in the forest!

11:14.807 --> 11:15.940
No, Barry.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.809
I-It's obviously
a control panel.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.179
I need you to respect my ideas.

11:24.883 --> 11:27.151
Look!

11:31.623 --> 11:32.590
Integrity breach.

11:32.624 --> 11:33.958
Panel exposed.

11:33.992 --> 11:35.093
Damn.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.829
Better close that panel
before the boys see it.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.531
Dad.

11:40.566 --> 11:43.301
He clearly put us in
some sort of CIA holodeck.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.269
I am fuming...

11:45.304 --> 11:46.771
and also nerding out!

11:53.879 --> 11:55.947
Come on, now's our chance!

11:57.816 --> 11:59.350
Whoa!

12:01.820 --> 12:05.022
Looks like the
tables have turned.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.290
Yep.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.060
I'd say this is a classic
dad-puts-son-in-holodeck-

12:09.094 --> 12:10.728
then-finds-himself-
in-said-holodeck-

12:10.763 --> 12:12.630
that's-now-controlled-
by-son scenario.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.574
Greetings, subject.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.909
On your feet, peasant!

12:24.943 --> 12:26.878
What... what the hell
is going on?

12:26.912 --> 12:29.614
Well, since I'm queen
of your solar system,

12:29.648 --> 12:31.449
I figured I should start
dressing like it.

12:31.483 --> 12:33.284
That's why I'm
wearing a prom dress

12:33.318 --> 12:34.919
from the Salvation Army.

12:34.953 --> 12:36.921
Okay, first of all, Hayley,

12:36.955 --> 12:38.923
we have a prime minister,
all right?

12:38.957 --> 12:40.057
Second, dress how you like.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.192
I couldn't care less.

12:41.226 --> 12:44.295
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a soufflé.

12:45.998 --> 12:50.101
This is Miss Kentucky 2007
all over again.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.605
Hey, look.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.541
They have the recorded memories

12:56.575 --> 12:58.242
of every CIA agent!

12:58.277 --> 12:59.277
Hmm...

12:59.311 --> 13:01.212
Let's mess with him.

13:01.246 --> 13:03.581
He thinks his childhood was
so much better than ours,

13:03.615 --> 13:05.249
let's send him back there.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.890
Wait, this is my childhood home!

13:12.925 --> 13:14.225
What's happening?

13:14.259 --> 13:17.295
Oh, the boys must have gotten
into the control room.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.596
Stan?

13:18.630 --> 13:19.797
Stan, is that you?

13:19.832 --> 13:21.165
Daddy?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.768
Hello, son.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.169
I love you!

13:25.204 --> 13:27.972
Wait, that's not
how Grandpa talks.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.174
He says "I love you"
with a cup check.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.742
I'll tell you why.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.110
His memories are being

13:33.145 --> 13:35.146
put through a nostalgia filter.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.149
He's seeing all of this
through rose-colored glasses.

13:38.183 --> 13:40.051
Well, let's take
this down to zero

13:40.085 --> 13:41.786
and see how things really were.

13:43.021 --> 13:44.655
I remember a time

13:44.690 --> 13:47.058
when we didn't need
a nostalgia filter.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.294
Oh, those were the days.

13:53.031 --> 13:54.532
Get out of here, I'm busy!

13:54.566 --> 13:55.800
Go play in your tree house!

13:55.834 --> 13:57.034
Oh.

13:57.069 --> 13:58.169
Okay.

13:58.203 --> 13:59.937
Yeah, I'll go play
in my tree house.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.138
Tree house!

14:04.176 --> 14:05.810
Oh, yeah.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.011
I remember that.

14:07.045 --> 14:09.213
How is he liking this?

14:09.248 --> 14:12.083
Ah... the old hood.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.751
Thanks, boys, this is great!

14:13.785 --> 14:16.387
There's the factory,
the slaughterhouse

14:16.421 --> 14:18.789
and the river of clotted beef
blood that came out of it

14:18.824 --> 14:20.358
where I used
to race paper boats.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.029
Ooh, I'm where I discovered
my first dead body!

14:27.065 --> 14:29.534
Aw, there's my special guy.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.435
This isn't messing with him.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.337
It's weird and he's loving it.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.506
You guys, what can we do
to mess with him?

14:35.541 --> 14:39.143
Well, this is basically
just a big computer game.

14:39.177 --> 14:40.912
I can try to change the code.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.380
Yes, my toad.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.682
"Pwn" him.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.117
I didn't notice
when I was younger,

14:46.151 --> 14:48.486
but this is a great tie.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.054
I wasn't trying to steal it!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.459
Nice job, Snot!

14:55.494 --> 14:56.827
It's so real!

14:56.862 --> 14:58.496
I-It looks like he's
actually getting hurt.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.630
He is.

14:59.665 --> 15:00.998
I thought that's
what we wanted.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.133
No!

15:02.167 --> 15:04.435
I-I just wanted to scare
him, not hurt him!

15:04.469 --> 15:07.071
Now might be a good
time to take a break.

15:14.528 --> 15:16.462
Snot, get rid of the zombie!

15:16.496 --> 15:17.588
That's impossible.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.586
The code's merged
with the simulation.

15:19.821 --> 15:21.233
I can't delete it.

15:30.110 --> 15:31.577
Okay, kids, that's enough!

15:31.611 --> 15:32.811
Turn it off!

15:34.948 --> 15:35.948
What the hell?

15:35.982 --> 15:37.550
How did it get so big?

15:37.584 --> 15:40.486
I used the Klara Hitler
code from our game.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.620
We made her bigger

15:41.655 --> 15:43.522
so it would be easier
to hit her belly.

15:43.557 --> 15:45.457
But we never won that game!

15:45.492 --> 15:47.893
Wow, we've had
a lot of backfires,

15:47.928 --> 15:49.662
but this is the most recent.

15:49.696 --> 15:51.997
He's getting larger!

15:52.032 --> 15:53.466
And more confident.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.268
He's not even walking
like a zombie anymore.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.137
He's skipping!

16:02.075 --> 16:03.909
I've gotta go save my dad.

16:03.944 --> 16:06.612
I've gotta go in there.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.752
Thank you, Toshi,
but I must go alone.

16:18.892 --> 16:20.192
All right, guys.

16:20.227 --> 16:21.994
Armor me and supply me
with weapons.

16:30.203 --> 16:32.571
And can I get some snacks
between me and the target?

16:34.508 --> 16:36.942
Oh, my God, these dots
are delicious!

16:36.977 --> 16:38.310
Who knew?

16:41.348 --> 16:43.315
Oh, greetings, royal subject.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.684
Be a good vassal
and fetch your queen

16:45.719 --> 16:47.686
a Choco Taco most frozen.

16:47.721 --> 16:49.288
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

16:49.322 --> 16:51.257
Kind of got my hands
full right now.

16:52.392 --> 16:53.893
Recognize this little guy?

16:53.927 --> 16:56.529
It's the goat you bought
for that family in Africa.

16:56.563 --> 16:58.697
Wait, h-how did you get him?

16:58.732 --> 17:00.733
Give me that certificate,
Hayley!

17:00.767 --> 17:02.568
Roger, what the hell
are you doing?

17:02.602 --> 17:04.069
Hand over that star certificate

17:04.104 --> 17:06.038
or the goat gets it!
Are you crazy?

17:06.071 --> 17:07.173
I don't know.

17:07.207 --> 17:09.742
I just went on a 53-hour
Dexatrim-fueled trip

17:09.776 --> 17:11.277
to Senegal to kidnap a goat!

17:11.310 --> 17:12.511
You tell me!

17:12.546 --> 17:14.280
Okay, fine!
Take it!

17:14.314 --> 17:15.347
Geez.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.282
Thank you!
Ha! I win!

17:17.317 --> 17:19.018
Actually, I win.

17:19.051 --> 17:21.186
Because only someone
who truly cared

17:21.221 --> 17:23.222
would have gone to the
lengths that you did.

17:25.325 --> 17:26.858
You poor thing.

17:26.893 --> 17:28.727
You think this is over.

17:30.430 --> 17:31.797
Nice dead guy!

17:31.832 --> 17:33.032
Good little dead guy!

17:33.066 --> 17:34.387
I thought you were
just a salesman

17:34.401 --> 17:35.534
who had a heart attack
on a hike!

17:35.569 --> 17:36.535
What the hell, man?

17:45.779 --> 17:47.646
Dad, take cover!

17:47.681 --> 17:50.082
And it's time for you
to chill out.

17:50.117 --> 17:51.917
Snot, change my gun
to a freeze ray

17:51.952 --> 17:53.953
so my clever line makes sense.

18:04.765 --> 18:06.932
Steve!

18:06.967 --> 18:08.100
Dad!

18:12.172 --> 18:14.306
I don't know if we'll
get out of here, son.

18:14.341 --> 18:16.042
He's unstoppable.

18:16.076 --> 18:18.210
If only he had an Achilles'
heel we could exploit.

18:18.245 --> 18:19.912
That's it!

18:19.946 --> 18:20.980
Snot, come in.

18:21.014 --> 18:22.615
I know you can't take out code,

18:22.649 --> 18:23.783
but can you add it?

18:23.817 --> 18:25.484
Yeah, you got a plan?

18:25.519 --> 18:26.819
I need you to program

18:26.853 --> 18:28.954
the Hitler fetus
into the zombie.

18:28.989 --> 18:30.322
What? Why?

18:30.357 --> 18:32.024
'Cause the zombie
needs a weak spot

18:32.059 --> 18:33.926
that we can use to defeat it.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.629
But we've never been able
to kill the Hitler baby.

18:36.663 --> 18:39.865
Maybe we just didn't have
a good enough reason.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.367
Oh, I get it.

18:41.401 --> 18:43.636
'Cause now it's <i> your</i> family.

18:48.809 --> 18:51.677
Steve, I just pressed "enter."

18:51.712 --> 18:53.045
Did it work?

18:54.348 --> 18:55.581
You did it!

18:59.720 --> 19:00.886
Dad!

19:00.921 --> 19:02.355
The fetus' weakness

19:02.389 --> 19:04.357
is the soft spot on his head!

19:04.391 --> 19:07.059
You need a direct hit!
With what?

19:07.094 --> 19:09.695
You said you were champion
of rock fights.

19:09.730 --> 19:11.197
Time to prove it!

19:13.333 --> 19:16.902
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i>
you undead son of a bitch!

19:29.249 --> 19:31.851
I'm the champion!

19:31.885 --> 19:33.819
Uh, Dad?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.558
Nice rock throwin', Pop!

19:39.593 --> 19:41.560
Nice...
video game...

19:41.595 --> 19:42.828
stuff, son!

19:42.863 --> 19:45.064
You know, I was wrong.

19:45.098 --> 19:47.700
I thought you boys
weren't prepared for the future.

19:47.734 --> 19:50.002
But now I realize your future

19:50.037 --> 19:51.671
is gonna be filled
with that crap, so...

19:51.705 --> 19:52.838
keep it up.

19:52.873 --> 19:54.774
You guys'll be just fine.

19:54.808 --> 19:55.942
Thanks, Dad.

19:55.976 --> 19:57.243
And maybe you can teach me

19:57.277 --> 19:58.611
how to throw a rock sometime.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.646
It's too late for that, friend.

20:04.084 --> 20:05.751
Oh, I didn't know other people

20:05.786 --> 20:07.386
used this thing
on the weekends.

20:07.421 --> 20:08.921
You guys can stay,

20:08.956 --> 20:10.957
but it's gonna
get really weird.

20:12.759 --> 20:14.193
Darling, hold off.

20:14.227 --> 20:16.896
They don't know if
they're staying yet.

20:19.433 --> 20:21.300
So then Dad nails
the Hitler fetus

20:21.335 --> 20:23.836
right in the head and the
whole thing explodes!

20:23.870 --> 20:25.004
Wow!

20:25.038 --> 20:26.572
Klaus, that makes your story

20:26.607 --> 20:28.207
about thinking someone
might've come to the door

20:28.241 --> 20:30.309
around 3:30
really boring.

20:30.344 --> 20:31.744
Maybe I told it wrong.

20:31.778 --> 20:33.079
It was crazy!

20:33.113 --> 20:35.181
Mom, dinner is
delicious tonight.

20:35.215 --> 20:36.449
Oh, Roger made it.

20:36.483 --> 20:37.650
Is it lamb?

20:37.684 --> 20:40.052
Similar to lamb.

20:40.087 --> 20:43.656
Oh... my... God!

20:43.690 --> 20:47.237
American Dad!
<i>remembers Mutumbo the goat.</i>
