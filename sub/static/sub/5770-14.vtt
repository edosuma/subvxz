THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
ON VALENTINE'S DAY,

00:03.568 --> 00:05.396
THE MOST ROMANTIC BUILDING
IN THE WORLD

00:05.440 --> 00:06.963
ON THE MOST ROMANTIC DAY
OF THE YEAR.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.879
SO MANY MEMORABLE ROMANCES
HAVE PLAYED OUT HERE.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.837
DEBORAH KERR
AND CARY GRANT

00:11.881 --> 00:13.535
IN AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.363
[as James Cagney]
"GIVE ME A SMOOCH,
RIGHT ON THE MUG, SEE?"

00:15.406 --> 00:17.800
I DO A PRETTY SPOT-ON
CARY GRANT.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.933
AND OF COURSE,
THE SECOND-BEST ROMANTIC COMEDY

00:20.977 --> 00:23.023
THAT MEG RYAN
AND TOM HANKS EVER MADE:

00:23.066 --> 00:24.589
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.983
EVERY COUPLE WEEKS,
I BUY A TICKET

00:27.027 --> 00:28.811
AND HANG OUT IN THE LOBBY
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

00:28.854 --> 00:30.726
TO SEE IF I WILL MEET
MY ONE TRUE LOVE.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.642
CAPTAIN, SHE'S BACK.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.166
SO YOU COME HERE REGULARLY

00:36.210 --> 00:38.081
TO MONITOR THE BASE
OF THE BUILDING.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.604
I'M HERE TO MEET
THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE,

00:39.648 --> 00:41.954
AND WHEN I DO,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE TOP,

00:41.998 --> 00:43.956
AND THEN, BOOM!
FIREWORKS.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.088
AND WHO IS THAT PERSON?

00:45.132 --> 00:46.394
I HAVEN'T MET HIM YET,

00:46.437 --> 00:47.830
BUT I CAN TELL
WHEN I FIND HIM,

00:47.873 --> 00:51.007
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND
ETERNITY TOGETHER.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.052
COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

00:52.095 --> 00:54.010
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HE'S IN HIS MID-30s.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.622
HE IS TALL, DARK,
INTENSE, MYSTERIOUS--

00:57.666 --> 00:59.059
YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US

00:59.102 --> 01:01.017
WOULD CAUSE US
SERIOUS CONCERN.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.279
YEAH. I CAN'T HELP IT,

01:02.323 --> 01:04.107
YOU KNOW,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DANGEROUS,

01:04.151 --> 01:05.500
BECAUSE I AM
A TRUE BELIEVER.

01:05.543 --> 01:08.285
HEY, WE'RE GONNA NEED MILLER
FROM HOMELAND SECURITY.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.852
HOMELANDSECURITY?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.158
THAT'S A COOL SHOW.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.724
WHY DO YOU HAVE A BAG
WITH A PASSPORT

01:12.768 --> 01:13.986
AND THREE CELL PHONES?

01:14.030 --> 01:16.032
OKAY, WELL,
THIS IS FOR THE INTERNET,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.686
THIS IS FOR TEXTING,

01:17.729 --> 01:20.254
AND THIS FLIP PHONE
IS BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW

01:20.297 --> 01:21.690
HOW TO TRANSFER
MY OLD CONTACTS.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.258
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME

01:24.301 --> 01:25.694
TALKING ABOUT ME

01:25.737 --> 01:28.088
THAT I HAVEN'T
ASKED YOU ANYTHING.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.132
WHAT ARE YOU INTO?

01:29.176 --> 01:30.568
PROTECTING THIS BUILDING.

01:30.612 --> 01:33.223
OOH, I LOVE THAT.
IT'S SO OLD-FASHIONED.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.833
YOU HAVE GREAT FACIAL HAIR.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.052
I LOVE A GUY
WITH A BEARD.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.184
CAN I TOUCH IT?

01:37.227 --> 01:38.576
HANDS ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.274
HEY, IT'S COOL
IF YOU'RE INTO ME.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.189
KEVIN GARNETT ONCE BOUGHT ME
A COKE AT A P.F. CHANG'S.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.668
YOU'RE NOT HELPING YOURSELF.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.366
I'M JUST SAYING
I DON'T SEE A WEDDING RING.

01:45.409 --> 01:49.761
IS THERE A MRS. CONFEDERATED
SECURITY SOLUTIONS?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.155
OH, MY GOD.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.201
YOU COULD'VE JUST SAID YES!

01:54.244 --> 01:57.204
[upbeat hip-hop music]

01:57.247 --> 02:03.340
[woman vocalizing]

02:03.384 --> 02:06.517
â™ª

02:11.392 --> 02:12.784
DR. LAHIRI,
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

02:12.828 --> 02:14.264
WITH DR. CASTELLANO.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.787
HE MIGHT BE DEAD.
WHAT?

02:15.831 --> 02:19.400
THERE'S DEFINITELY A SMELL.OKAY.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.402
DANNY--OH, MY GOD.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.273
HOLY CRAP!
WHAT THE HELL?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.274
[whack]YEP?

02:24.318 --> 02:26.798
DANNY, GET UP.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:26.842 --> 02:28.931
OKAY, I'M UP.PUT SOME PANTS ON.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.324
I CAN SEE THE OUTLINE
OF YOUR PENIS.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.542
I KNOW THAT EYE PATCH
DUMPED YOU,

02:31.586 --> 02:32.543
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
SPEND THE NIGHT

02:32.587 --> 02:34.371
IN YOUR OFFICE, DRUNK,

02:34.415 --> 02:36.547
PLAYING WEIRD BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
SONGS ON YOUR TINY PIANO.

02:36.591 --> 02:37.896
STOP THAT.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.811
WHAT'S--OH, GOD.
I STOOD UP TOO QUICK.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.813
THIS IS AWFUL.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?[groans]

02:41.857 --> 02:43.946
YOUR VOICE
IS TOO LOUD.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.078
THIS ISN'T ME.
IT'S YOU.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.384
OKAY, THAT IS NOT ME.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.516
WHEN I LAY ON THE FLOOR,
IT'S ADORABLE,

02:48.559 --> 02:49.473
AND IT IS TRAGIC.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.735
WHEN YOU LAY ON THE FLOOR,

02:50.779 --> 02:52.563
YOU LOOK LIKE
AN UPSIDE-DOWN LADYBUG.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.391
MY GOD, AM I THE ONLY PERSON
NOT CRAWLING ABOUT

02:54.435 --> 02:55.697
ON THE FLOOR TODAY?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.351
YOU GUYS, I DROPPED
A MIKE AND IKE ON THE FLOOR.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.917
I NEED ALL EYES ON THIS.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.354
DANNY, YOU'RE A GROWN-UP.
GET UP.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.529
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.660
I'M GONNA GET
MYSELF TOGETHER.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.096
I'M GONNA PULL IT TOGETHER.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.447
I'M GONNA MEET ANOTHER GIRL.
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.796
I HAVE FOUND THAT
WHEN I AM HEARTBROKEN,

03:07.839 --> 03:09.580
IT IS ACTUALLY BEST
TO THROW MYSELF INTO WORK.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.539
WHICH IS WHY, ON THURSDAY, I AM GOING TO DO YOU

03:11.582 --> 03:13.323
THE FAVOR OF GIVING YOU
ALL OF MY PATIENTS

03:13.367 --> 03:14.498
FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.673
MINDY, IT'S FINE.

03:15.717 --> 03:16.631
I'LL LOOK AFTER YOUR PATIENTS
ON THURSDAY.

03:16.674 --> 03:17.806
YOU ENJOY
YOUR VALENTINE'S DAY.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.373
OH, IS THURSDAY
VALENTINE'S DAY?
YES. NICE.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.505
I-I HADN'T REMEMBERED.
OKAY.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.593
WAIT, HOW COME YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

03:22.637 --> 03:23.899
DON'T HAVE PLANS
ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

03:23.942 --> 03:25.422
WELL, AS A MAN
WHO'S LOOKING TO AVOID

03:25.466 --> 03:26.858
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP,

03:26.902 --> 03:28.512
VALENTINE'S DAY CAN BE
SOMETHING OF A MINEFIELD.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.688
"OH, A DOZEN ROSES.
YOU MUST REALLY LIKE ME."

03:30.732 --> 03:32.560
"HEY, DO YOU WANT TO SHARE
A DESSERT?"

03:32.603 --> 03:33.474
"OH, THAT MEANS YOU MUST WANT
TO MEET MY PARENTS,

03:33.517 --> 03:34.475
WHO LIVE IN MINNEAPOLIS."

03:34.518 --> 03:36.259
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL BOSNIA.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.695
THINK I'LL SIT IT OUT, THANKS. WELL, GREAT.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.002
THEN I CAN HAVE VALENTINE'S DAY
WITH JAMIE.

03:40.045 --> 03:42.091
AS IN JAMIE AND LUCY?

03:42.134 --> 03:43.135
NOW, THERE'S A GREAT COUPLE.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.615
NOPE,
NOT AS IN JAMIE AND LUCY.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.051
AS IN JAMIE AND MINDY.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.749
BUT AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE CHEMISTRY

03:47.792 --> 03:48.837
THEY SEEM TO HAVE?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.186
THEY DON'T HAVE
GOOD CHEMISTRY.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.492
I HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY
WITH JAMIE.

03:51.535 --> 03:55.017
I'M REALLY LONELY.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.324
[Jamie]
MoMA WAS SUCH
A FUN IDEA, MINDY.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.152
I LOVE MODERN ART MUSEUMS.YEAH.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.589
I FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE LESS INTIMIDATING

04:01.632 --> 04:03.634
'CAUSE I THINK
I COULD DO THE ART.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.070
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR STICKER IS COMING OFF.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.246
OH, ACTUALLY, LEAVE IT.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.334
I LIKE PEOPLE
TO KNOW THAT I HAD

04:07.377 --> 04:08.726
A MORE CULTURAL DAY
THAN THEY DID.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.293
OH, IT'S LIKE THE ARTSY VERSION
OF "I VOTED."

04:10.337 --> 04:12.382
OH, YES, I HAVE
A SKI LIFT TICKET

04:12.426 --> 04:13.731
ON MY PARKA
FROM TWO YEARS AGO.

04:13.775 --> 04:14.950
WHEN YOU TEACH LATIN
FOR A LIVING,

04:14.993 --> 04:16.386
IT HELPS TO LOOK LIKE
A HUGE JOCK SOMETIMES.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.518
HEY, YOU GUYS.

04:17.561 --> 04:18.519
SORRY I'M LATE.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.781
NO, NOT AT ALL.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.478
IT TURNS OUT
THE DEFENDANT'S GANG

04:21.522 --> 04:23.306
HAD A COPY OF MY HOME ADDRESS,
BECAME A THING.WHAT?

04:23.350 --> 04:24.568
WHAT?OH, MY GOD.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.266
THEY ALWAYS THREATEN ME.
NOTHING EVER PANS OUT.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.572
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT THIS GIRL DEALS WITH?NO.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.618
EVERY DAY, SHE LOOKS MURDERERS
IN THE EYE AND PUTS THEM

04:30.661 --> 04:32.010
IN PRISON FOR THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.403
WOW. SO IMPORTANT.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.405
I MEAN, SPEAKING
OF STRESSFUL SITUATIONS,

04:35.449 --> 04:36.624
I DELIVERED A BABY
LAST NIGHT.

04:36.667 --> 04:37.886
HE DID NOT WANT
TO BE BORN.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.061
HE WAS REALLY MAD
AT ME.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.584
I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T HAVE
MY HOME ADDRESS.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.803
[chuckles]THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.326
HEY, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
YOU KNOW,

04:43.370 --> 04:44.980
IF YOU EVER FEAR FOR YOUR SAFETY, YOU STILL HAVE A KEY.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.503
IF YOU EVER WANT TO STAY
AT MY PLACE,

04:46.547 --> 04:47.765
YOU KNOW YOU CAN, RIGHT?

04:47.809 --> 04:49.724
WELL, I WOULD RATHER TAKE ON
THE SINALOA CARTEL

04:49.767 --> 04:51.813
THAN DEAL WITH THE WATER
PRESSURE IN THIS GUY'S SHOWER.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.423
[laughs]
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.729
[laughs heartily]IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:54.772 --> 04:55.947
YOU'RE SO GREAT.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.993
YOU SHOULD HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.864
I WOULD LOVE TO MEET A COOL GUY,
EXCEPT ALL THE GUYS I MEET

04:59.908 --> 05:02.954
ARE EITHER 19-YEAR-OLD MURDERERS
OR 80-YEAR-OLD JUDGES.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.391
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
I'M GONNA FIND YOU SOMEONE.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.001
NO, I REALLY WOULDN'T TRY.YEAH, GREAT.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.569
THIS GIRL IS THE PICKIEST DATER
I HAVE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.222
NO, NO, I'M ACTUALLY
A VERY GOOD MATCHMAKER.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.789
WELL, I WISH YOU LUCK,

05:11.833 --> 05:14.009
BUT NO ONE'S EVER
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS GIRL.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.010
SO I WOULDN'T EVEN TRY.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.795
[Jamie] SO MINDY AT THE MUSEUM...

05:19.057 --> 05:20.972
AH, DANNY.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.887
TEAR UP THAT SUICIDE NOTE.
I HAVE GREAT NEWS.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.672
OKAY, THAT WASN'T
A SUICIDE NOTE.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.282
I WAS CONTESTING
A JAYWALKING TICKET.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.631
OH. I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.198
DANNY, I AM GOING
TO SET YOU UP ON A DATE.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.635
THIS MORNING YOU SAID I SHOULD
THROW MYSELF BACK INTO WORK.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.941
THAT WAS, LIKE,
SIX HOURS AGO, OKAY?

05:32.984 --> 05:33.942
THAT'S AN ENTIRE LIFETIME
FOR SOME BUGS.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.117
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
THIS GIRL.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.032
SHE IS PRETTY.
SHE IS SMART.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.121
SHE OWNS A MOTOR SCOOTER.AH.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.732
IT'S LUCY.LUCY OF JAMIE AND LUCY?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.299
THEY BROKE UP?I AM DATING JAMIE

05:43.343 --> 05:44.518
OF JAMIE AND MINDY.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.562
WE KISSED MOUTHS, DANNY.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.607
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

05:46.650 --> 05:47.999
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.871
WELL, YOU WOULD ALSO
BE DOING ME A HUGE FAVOR.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.351
IF YOU SPEND TIME
WITH LUCY,

05:51.394 --> 05:53.178
THEN JAMIE WON'T SPEND
AS MUCH TIME WITH HER.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.266
ALSO, THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.355
I AM SETTING YOU UP
WITH SOMEONE.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.573
YOU NEVER SET ME UP
WITH ANYBODY.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.140
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I HOOKED YOU UP WITH REYNALDO.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.011
YOUR GARBAGE MAN?
YEAH.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.970
HE WAS SMOKIN' HOT,
BUT HE WAS A LITTLE PRETENTIOUS.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.189
A LITTLE BIT TOO WELL READ,
IF I MAY SAY THAT.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.234
DANNY, PLEASE DO THIS
FOR ME.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.366
CAN I THINK ABOUT IT?
DANNY!

06:06.409 --> 06:07.497
YOU ARE SO SELFISH!

06:07.541 --> 06:08.846

UNLESS YOU DO THIS FOR ME.STOP HITTING ME.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.722
I'LL GO ON ONE DATE

WELL, I DON'T GET A LOT
OF PATIENT COMPLAINTS.

06:39.834 --> 06:40.922
[laughs]

06:40.965 --> 06:42.880
IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU WORK
IN THE MORGUE

06:42.924 --> 06:46.580
BECAUSE MY NAME
IS MORG-AN.

06:46.623 --> 06:50.540
PLEASE WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

06:50.584 --> 06:51.585
NOPE.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.674
NOTHING. SORRY.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.240
[sighs]
UH, DR. REED.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.590
DID YOU SEE ME
HIT ON THAT GIRL?

06:56.633 --> 06:57.765
UNFORTUNATELY,
I DID, YES.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.767
I'VE HAD MY EYE ON HER
FOR A WHILE.

06:59.810 --> 07:00.942
I'M GONNA TAKE HER
TO THE BATTING CAGES,

07:00.985 --> 07:02.334
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.727
WELL, LET ME KNOW
HOW THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.076
OKAY, HERE'S MY PLAN.
I AM GOING

07:05.120 --> 07:06.904
TO PUT THESE
IN THE LADIES' ROOM

07:06.948 --> 07:08.645
IN ALL THE STALLS.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.473
"ME WITH OUT GO"--NO, NO, READ IT UP--

07:10.517 --> 07:11.605
OH. "WILL YOU GO OUT
WITH ME?"

07:11.648 --> 07:13.520
AND THEN SHE'LL BE
LIKE, "WHAT?

07:13.563 --> 07:14.956
YES."

07:14.999 --> 07:18.350
MORGAN, WHAT IF SOMEBODY USES
THE BATHROOM BEFORE HER?

07:18.394 --> 07:19.308
YEP, NOT A GOOD IDEA.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.614
PLAN "B."

07:20.657 --> 07:22.485
SURPRISE HER
IN HER CAR TONIGHT.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.269
THAT'S A FELONY.NOT ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.706
DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE HOLIDAY IS.CHECK THE LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.142
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
ABOUT THAT.

07:27.185 --> 07:30.493
[sighs]
MORGAN, WAIT.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.842
MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU.

07:31.886 --> 07:32.843
REALLY?

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
OH, GOD,
THAT WOULD BE SO GOOD.

07:34.802 --> 07:35.933
[banging at door]

07:35.977 --> 07:38.545
COMING, I'M COMING.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.589
HEY.
HEY.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
WHY ARE YOU SO EARLY?

07:41.069 --> 07:42.766
TEN MINUTES? YEAH.

07:42.810 --> 07:43.767
YOU'RE TEN MINUTES
EARLY, DANNY,

07:43.811 --> 07:45.508
WHICH IS WORSE
THAN TWO HOURS LATE.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.727
THOSE LAST TEN MINUTES,

07:46.770 --> 07:49.469
THAT'S WHEN I GO FROM "WHOA"
TO "DAMN."

07:49.512 --> 07:50.687
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.037
WHY DID I HAVE TO COME
HERE FIRST, ANYWAYS?

07:53.081 --> 07:54.691
WELL, YOU ARE GOING
ON A DATE WITH MY FRIEND.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.084
MM-HMM.AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

07:56.127 --> 07:57.651
THAT YOU DIDN'T LOOK WEIRD.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.087
YOU HAD, LIKE,
A MUSTACHE OR SOMETHING.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.698
HOW WOULD I GROW A MUSTACHE
SINCE THIS MORNING?

08:01.742 --> 08:02.917
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT ITALIAN.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.266
ALSO, IT'S GOOD
WHEN I'M GETTING PRETTY

08:04.309 --> 08:05.354
FOR THERE TO BE A GUY HERE,
SO HE CAN BE LIKE,

08:05.397 --> 08:06.355
"HURRY UP!
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE!"

08:06.398 --> 08:08.749
WHAT?

08:08.792 --> 08:09.793
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.360
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO WEAR THAT?

08:11.403 --> 08:13.754
IT BEING ON ME IMPLIES
THAT I WANT TO WEAR IT.

08:13.797 --> 08:17.018
OKAY. I LIKE IT.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.586
WOW.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.892
A WHOLE ROOM
THAT'S A CLOSET?

08:21.936 --> 08:23.241
YOU COULD MAKE THIS
INTO A LITTLE GYM,

08:23.285 --> 08:24.547
HANG A HEAVY BAG THERE.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.114
YEAH, DANNY,
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.377
I WANT A BAG
FULL OF SAND TO PUNCH

08:28.420 --> 08:30.988
INSTEAD OF ALL MY CLOTHES.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.555
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
YOU LIKE THAT?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.818
LET ME GUESS: YOU WANT ME
TO WEAR A LITTLE BLACK DRESS,

08:34.862 --> 08:36.603
PUSH-UP BRA, HIGH HEELS.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.518
BORING, SEXY, ANONYMOUS GIRL.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.693
SEXY'S NOT BORING.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.216
YOU GOT ANY FOOD?
COLD CUTS?

08:41.259 --> 08:43.479
NO, BUT I THINK I HAVE
SOME PIZZA FROM ELECTION NIGHT.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.004
I THINK THIS DATE'S
GONNA BE FUN.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.746
LET'S TAKE A SHOT.
YOU LOOK NICE.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.139

NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.193

09:02.237 --> 09:03.238
OH, MAN.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.805
WHAT?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.241
THAT'S A KING SALMON
OVER THERE.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.459
SO?

09:07.503 --> 09:09.026
JILLIAN STUDIED THE MIGRATION
OF THAT FISH.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.332
NO.
YEAH. THAT FISH GOES
FROM SALT WATER...

09:10.375 --> 09:11.594
NO. STOP IT.
TO FRESH WATER.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.117
IT'S AN AMAZING FISH.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.162
THEY DO IT TO MATE.NOBODY CARES.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.250

09:15.293 --> 09:16.294
HEY.
HEY, GUYS?

09:16.338 --> 09:17.339
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:17.382 --> 09:18.601
REALLY GOOD.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.037
WOULD YOU MIND
SWITCHING SEATS WITH ME?

09:20.081 --> 09:21.996
BECAUSE THAT FISH
IS IN MY EYE LINE,

09:22.039 --> 09:23.475
JUST PUTTING ME IN A--

09:23.519 --> 09:25.260
A BAD PLACE EMOTIONALLY
RIGHT NOW.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.478
THE FISH?

09:26.522 --> 09:28.306
THAT ONE, YEAH.
YEAH?

09:28.350 --> 09:29.873
YEAH, SURE.
IT'S YOUR EYE LINE.DO YOU MIND?

09:29.917 --> 09:32.093
OKAY, GREAT.
THANKS.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.094
[Jamie]
WOULDN'T WANT TO LOOK

09:33.137 --> 09:34.356
AT SOMETHING
I DIDN'T LIKE.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.314
OH, YEAH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.099
GOOD.

09:38.142 --> 09:41.189
SO CAN I ASK WHAT EXACTLY
YOUR PROBLEM IS

09:41.232 --> 09:42.407
WITH SEA LIFE?

09:42.451 --> 09:45.019
OH, IT'S JUST,
MY EX WAS AN OCEANOGRAPHER.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.150
IT'S STUPID.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.195
YEAH, IT IS STUPID.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.413
HEY, LOOK
AT THIS BREAD SELECTION.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.372
THERE'S WHITE BREAD. THERE'S THE BROWN BREAD.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.983
JUST IF I KEEP MYSELF
FROM SEEING TRIGGERS,

09:53.027 --> 09:54.202
THEN, YOU KNOW,

09:54.245 --> 09:55.203
I DON'T FIXATE ON HER--

09:55.246 --> 09:56.421
OW!

09:56.465 --> 09:58.032
DID SOMEBODY
JUST KICK ME?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.207
YOU OKAY? OW!

09:59.250 --> 10:00.425
[Mindy] YEAH, THAT IS SO WEIRD.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.992
I THINK THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD MOVE TABLES,

10:02.036 --> 10:04.168
OR WE COULD TRY
NOT TALKING ABOUT EXES

10:04.212 --> 10:05.213
AND SEE
IF THE KICKING STOPS.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.344
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

10:06.388 --> 10:08.390
I HAVE FOUND
THAT THE HARDEST BREAKUPS

10:08.433 --> 10:09.826
ARE THE ONES
WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE

10:09.870 --> 10:11.654
UNDERESTIMATED THE PERSON
WHILE YOU WERE WITH THEM,

10:11.698 --> 10:12.873
I DON'T KNOW IF--

10:12.916 --> 10:14.657
YES. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.659
REALLY?
YES.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.921
IT--IT'S LIKE YOU'RE--

10:17.965 --> 10:19.270
[laughs]
I KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.532
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IS GOING ON

10:20.576 --> 10:22.273
WITH ME AND JILLIAN. NO WAY.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.666
WELL, IT WAS ME, REALLY.
I JUST--

10:23.710 --> 10:24.885
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.364
UH, JAMIE?
YEAH.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.322
I DON'T WANT
TO JINX THIS,

10:27.365 --> 10:29.019
BUT I THINK
MATCH-DOT-MINDY

10:29.063 --> 10:30.325
MIGHT HAVE
ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.327
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE
A FRIENDSHIP, MAYBE.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.807
YEAH?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.025
SO, MORGAN,
YOU WANT TO TAKE

10:35.069 --> 10:36.418
THIS GIRL
TO THE BATTING CAGES.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.680
I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHAT THOSE ARE.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.073
THREE-PRONGED ATTACK,
MORGAN.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.944
NUMBER ONE, CASUAL APPROACH.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.076
WATCH ME, WATCH ME,
WATCH ME.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.555
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING?

10:43.599 --> 10:44.600
WHAT AM I DOING?I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA--

10:44.644 --> 10:45.993
NOW.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.298
WOW, OKAY, YOU LOOK
LIKE JOE BIDEN.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.604
THAT IS AWESOME.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.955
NUMBER TWO, INITIATE
SOME LIGHT PHYSICAL CONTACT.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.000
OKAY.
OH, RED.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.262
NICE COLOR.
OH, YEAH.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.872
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY,
AND IT HIDES THE BLOOD.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.962
THAT'S DISGUSTING. NUMBER THREE.
OFFER HER SOMETHING SMALL.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.095
A TOKEN OF SORTS.
IT ESTABLISHES A DEBT.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.663
GOT A FREE COLA
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.795
OH, I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN STARING
AT THAT THING ALL MORNING.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.015
THANKS, DOC.
I OWE YOU ONE.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.017
OH! IT'S A--
PART OF THE ROUTINE.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.235
THERE IT IS.
OKAY.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.454
IT'S THE DEBT.
I GOT IT.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.934
YOU JUST GIVE HER
WHATEVER YOU HAVE ON YOU.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.326
WHY NOT?
ALL RIGHT.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.327
SO I'LL BE LIKE,

11:16.371 --> 11:19.504
"HEY, THIS IS FOR YOU."

11:21.158 --> 11:22.333
WHERE'S THE BODY?

11:22.377 --> 11:23.813
I JUST FOUND THE HEAD
IN THE TOILET.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.119
OH, GOD.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.990
YOU NEVER KNOW
A LOVE SONG

11:27.034 --> 11:28.339
UNTIL YOU HAVE
A BROKEN HEART, RIGHT?

11:28.383 --> 11:29.732
MM, YES.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
AND FINALLY YOU REALIZE
THAT ALL OF THESE SONGS

11:31.429 --> 11:32.866
THAT YOU THOUGHT
WERE SO HAPPY-SOUNDING

11:32.909 --> 11:34.084
ARE ACTUALLY SO SAD.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.738
LIKE YOU CAN CALL ME AL.
MM.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.914
"WHERE IS MY WIFE
AND FAMILY?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.307
WHAT IF I DIE HERE?"

11:39.350 --> 11:41.091
WHO'LL BE MY ROLE MODEL
NOW THAT MY...
ONCE MY...

11:41.135 --> 11:42.527
[both]
ROLE MODEL'S GONE?

11:42.571 --> 11:43.964
MAN, I GOTTA DOWNLOAD
THAT ALBUM AGAIN.
MM-HMM.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.052
IT'S A GREAT ONE.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.488
I THINK THEY REALLY LIKE
EACH OTHER.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.837
WELL, THEY LIKE PAUL SIMON.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.099
SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE
ON THE PLANET.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.622
NO, IT'S LIKE
WE'RE NOT EVEN HERE.

11:50.666 --> 11:51.623
HEY, GUYS.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.929
HEY, THERE'S FOUR
OF US HERE.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.148
SO LET'S TRY TO--
OH.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.845
SORRY.OH, IT'S OKAY.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.152
DANNY WAS JUST
HELPING ME

11:58.195 --> 12:00.154
FIGURE OUT WHERE I SHOULD GET
MY FIRST TATTOO.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.068
UH-OH.
[clears throat]

12:01.111 --> 12:03.374
UM, YOU HATE TATTOOS.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.636
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.508
I THINK I'M GONNA GET
A TATTOO AS WELL.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.075
A LITTLE BUTTERFLY
ON THE NAPE OF MY NECK,

12:08.118 --> 12:09.859
AND IT WOULD SIGNIFY
THAT I'M A FREE SPIRIT--

12:09.903 --> 12:11.165
WHAT TATTOO
ARE YOU GONNA GET?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.209
WELL,

12:12.253 --> 12:14.124
I THINK I SHOULD
KEEP IT A SECRET,

12:14.168 --> 12:15.212
BECAUSE WHERE I WANT
TO GET IT,

12:15.256 --> 12:16.779
ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE
WOULD SEE IT.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.260
I-I DON'T KNOW, LUCE.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.305
I WORRY THAT A TATTOO IS A LITTLE SHORT-SIGHTED.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.264
YOU KNOW?MMM. CAN I TRY THAT?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.482
IS YOUR GRANDSON
REALLY GONNA UNDERSTAND

12:24.526 --> 12:26.310
WHY YOU HAVE A RADIOHEAD LYRIC

12:26.354 --> 12:27.659
UNDER YOUR BELLY BUTTON?

12:27.703 --> 12:28.791
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
RADIOHEAD NOW.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.097
MMM!

12:30.140 --> 12:32.316
DO YOU WANNA HAVE SOME
OF MY COD?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.101
I'M FINE.
I JUST HAD SOME.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.886
WOW, THAT LAMB
IS SO, MMM, SUCCULENT.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.192
[Danny]
IT IS SUCCULENT.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.020
YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD ORDERER.THANK YOU.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.630
PICK A GOOD RESTAURANT,
AND THEY SAY, YOU KNOW,

12:41.673 --> 12:42.805
THE FOOD
ORDERS ITSELF, SO...

12:42.849 --> 12:45.329
MMM, TRY THIS.
OKAY.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.722
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!
LUCY!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.289
YOUR COLD.
HMM?

12:48.332 --> 12:49.290
SHE HAD THIS HORRIBLE COLD
LAST WEEK.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.334
I'M GOOD WITH IT.
I'LL TAKE IT.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.640
YOU MIGHT
GET SOMETHING.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.163
I'M NOT SICK.
DO YOU WANT SOME OF MY COD?

12:53.207 --> 12:54.425
I DON'T GET SICK THAT OFTEN. I DON'T HAVE A COLD.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.426
YOU DON'T?
NO.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.732
EAT OFF MY FORK.
IT'S ROMANTIC.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.212
