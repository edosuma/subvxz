WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:05.753
(walkers snarling,
banging )

00:05.923 --> 00:07.879
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

00:08.050 --> 00:09.506
He's bleeding out.
We gotta go back.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.588
Come around here.
Put pressure on the knee.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.219
Hard, hard!
Push,push.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.846
Why don't you come on
out of there?

00:16.017 --> 00:18.599
Slow and steady.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.100
What happened to him?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.761
- He got bit.
- Bit?

00:21.939 --> 00:23.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.016
Nobody needs
to get hurt.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.559
- I need you to hold this.
- Okay.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.102
- As hard as you can.
- Yes.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.565
You have medical supplies?

00:30.740 --> 00:32.276
Whoa, where do you think
you're going?

00:32.450 --> 00:35.442
(walkers banging,
snarling )

00:35.620 --> 00:37.906
Who the hell
are you people, anyway?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.616
Don't look like
no rescue team.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.532
If a rescue team is what
you're waiting for, don't.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.619
Come on, we gotta go.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.459
Now! Come on!
I need a hand here.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.465
One, two, three, go!

00:51.636 --> 00:53.968
- Holy Jesus!
- T, the door.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.299
- Are you crazy? Don't open that!
- We got this.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.257
(snarling )

01:02.230 --> 01:04.266
Rick:
Daryl. Daryl!

01:07.985 --> 01:10.397
Let's go.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.562
Rick:
This way.

01:18.329 --> 01:18.363
(theme music playing )

01:18.371 --> 01:20.987
(theme music playing )

01:56.367 --> 01:57.607
Rick:
This way, this way.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.865
No, no, no.
Back, back!

01:59.036 --> 02:00.537
- ( snarling )
- Daryl.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.542
- Come on!
- Rick: Go, go, go.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.621
Go, go, go.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.519
Stop, stop.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.395
Man:
Follow the flashlight.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.978
Come on, let's go.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.234
Go, go, go.

02:37.742 --> 02:41.075
Rick: Easy, easy.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.406
- He's losing too much blood.
- Open the door!

02:43.581 --> 02:44.912
lt's Hershel!

02:45.082 --> 02:46.242
Carl! Come on.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.748
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy!

02:47.918 --> 02:49.294
Go, go, go, go, go.
In there.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.544
Turn it. Turn it.
Turn around.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.581
Get him on the bed.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.090
Daryl:
He got bit.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.591
- Oh, my God, he's gonna turn.
- Did you cut it off?

02:57.762 --> 02:59.093
- Yeah.
- Maybe you got it in time.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.594
- Ready?
- Okay.

03:00.765 --> 03:03.097
One, two, three.
( grunts )

03:04.560 --> 03:07.927
- One, two, three.
- Carol: Oh, God.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.772
Oh!
Oh, I need bandages.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.024
- We used everything we had.
- Well, get more. Anything.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.776
Carl, go get the towels from
the back, right next to my bed.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.277
- Is he gonna die?
- No, no, no, no.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.530
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.689
You think you can
stabilize him?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.199
I need to keep
his leg elevated.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.610
Get some pillows!

03:23.788 --> 03:25.278
He's already bled
through the sheets.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.538
We can burn the wound
to clot the blood. I can start a fire.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.539
- No, please don't do this.
- Carol: No, the shock could kill him.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.450
It's not gonna stop
the arteries from bleeding.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.836
We need to just keep it dressed
and let it heal on its own.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.042
Oh, God.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.844
( footsteps approaching )

03:59.365 --> 04:02.152
That's far enough.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.782
Cell block C.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.944
Cell 4--
that's mine, gringo.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.453
Let me in.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.534
Today's your
lucky days, fellas.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.120
You've been pardoned by the state
of Georgia. You're free to go.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.001
- What you got going on in there?
- It ain't none of your concern.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.037
Don't be telling me
what's my concern.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.673
Chill, man.
Dude's leg is messed up.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.005
Besides, we're free now.
Why are we still in here?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.464
The man's got a point.

04:23.639 --> 04:24.719
Yeah, and I gotta check
on my old lady.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.006
A group of civilians
breaking in to a prison

04:27.184 --> 04:28.970
you got no business being in--

04:29.145 --> 04:31.181
got me thinking there ain't
no place for us to go.

04:31.355 --> 04:34.347
- Why don't you go find out?
- Maybe we'll just be going now.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.891
- Hey, we ain't leaving.
- You ain't coming in either.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.981
Hey, this is my house, my rules.
| go where l damn well please.

04:40.156 --> 04:43.114
- What was that?
- Prisoners, survivors.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.276
- Glenn: What?
- It's all right. Everybody stay put.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.619
Do not leave his side.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.920
If he dies, you need
to be there for that.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.046
You think
you can do this?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.175
- Maggie will be there.
- I got it.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.882
- I can bring T in here.
- I got it.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.214
- Good.
-( Daryl, prisoners arguing )

05:15.149 --> 05:16.264
There ain't nothing
for you here.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.057
Why don't you go back
to your own sandbox?

05:18.235 --> 05:21.068
Hey, everyone relax.
There's no need for this.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.398
How many of you
are in there?

05:22.573 --> 05:25.736
Too many for you
to handle.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.525
You guys rob a bank
or something?

05:27.703 --> 05:29.318
Why don't you take him
to a hospital?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.213
How long have you been
locked in that cafeteria?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.582
Going on like 10 months.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.260
Big Tiny:
A riot broke out.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.466
Neverseen
anything like it.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.723
Axel:
Attica on speed, man.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.554
Ever heard about
dudes going cannibal,

05:52.728 --> 05:54.434
dying, coming back to life?

05:54.605 --> 05:56.266
Crazy.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.556
One guard looked out for us,
locked us up in the cafeteria.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.646
Told us sit tight, threw me this piece,
said he'd be right back.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.947
Yeah, and that
was 292 days ago.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.322
- 94 according to my calcula--
- Shut up!

06:07.493 --> 06:09.529
Oscar: We were thinking that
the Army or the National Guard

06:09.703 --> 06:11.659
should be showing up
any day now.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.912
Rick:
There is no Army.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.869
What do you mean?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.456
There's no government,
no hospitals, no police.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.791
It's all gone.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.998
For real?

06:25.177 --> 06:26.963
Seﬁous.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.302
What about my moms?

06:32.476 --> 06:36.014
My kids?
And my old lady?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.646
Yo, you got a cell phone or something
that we can call our families?

06:39.817 --> 06:41.353
You just don't
get it, do you?

06:41.527 --> 06:44.735
No phones,
no computers.

06:46.991 --> 06:48.026
As far as we can see,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.111
at least half the population
has been wiped out.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.823
Probably more.

06:58.711 --> 07:02.499
- Ain't no way.
- See for yourself.

07:20.733 --> 07:24.317
Oscar:
Damn, the sun feels good.

07:24.486 --> 07:28.104
Axel: Good lord.
They're all dead.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.115
Tomas: Never thought I'd be
so happy to see these fences.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.370
Andrew:
You never said--

07:36.540 --> 07:39.373
how the hell did you get
in here in the first place?

07:39.543 --> 07:42.626
Cut a hole in that fence
over there by that guard tower.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.583
That easy, huh?

07:45.758 --> 07:47.498
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.212
Easy for you to say.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.887
So what is this,
like a disease?

07:54.058 --> 07:56.891
Yeah, and we're all infected.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.510
Axel:
What do you mean infected?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.394
Like AIDS or something?

08:01.565 --> 08:04.557
Daryl: If I was to kill you,
shoot an arrow in your chest,

08:04.735 --> 08:08.398
you'd come back
as one of these things.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.312
It's gonna happen
to all of us.

08:12.785 --> 08:14.446
Tomas: Ain't no way
these Robin Hood cats

08:14.620 --> 08:16.576
responsible for killing
all these freaks.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.908
Must be 50 bodies
out here.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.416
Where'd you come from?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.498
Atlanta.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.791
Where are you headed?

08:29.968 --> 08:32.095
For now, nowhere.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.759
I guess you can take that area
down there near the water.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.020
Should be comfortable.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.930
We're using
that field for crops.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.942
- We'll help you move your gear out.
- Rick: That won't be necessary.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.774
We took out these walkers.
This prison is ours.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.612
You snatched the locks
off our doors.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.868
We'll give you new locks,
if that's how you want it.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.780
This is our prison.
We were here first.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.950
Locked in a broom closet?

09:04.128 --> 09:05.834
We took it, set you free.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.835
lt's ours.
We spilled blood.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.746
We're moving back
into our cell block.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.165
You'll have to get your own.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.879
It is mine. I've still got personal
artifacts in there.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.135
- That's about as mine as it gets.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.718
Maybe let's try to make this
work out so everybody wins.

09:18.892 --> 09:23.226
- I don't see that happening.
- Neither do |.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.935
I ain't going back in that cafeteria
for one more minute.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.974
There are other
cell blocks.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.189
You could leave.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.149
Try your luck
out on the road.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.748
If these three pussies
can do all this,

09:44.918 --> 09:47.034
the least we can do
is take out another cell block.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.419
With what?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.376
Atlanta here will spot us
some real weapons.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.292
Won't you, boss?

09:54.470 --> 09:56.836
How stocked
is that cafeteria?

09:57.014 --> 09:58.174
It must have
plenty of food.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.509
Five guys lasting
almost a year?

10:00.684 --> 10:03.676
It sure as hell don't
look like anybody's been starving.

10:03.854 --> 10:07.517
- There's only a little left.
- We'll take half.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.683
In exchange, we'll help
clear out a cell block.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.648
Didn't you hear him?
There's only a little left.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.985
Bet you got more food
than you got choices.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.620
You pay, we'll play.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.621
We'll clear out a block for you,
then you keep to it.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.585
All right.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.085
But let's be clear--

10:30.255 --> 10:33.372
if we see you out here
anywhere near our people,

10:33.550 --> 10:35.541
if I so much as even catch
a whiff of your scent,

10:35.719 --> 10:37.835
|wi|| kill you.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.549
Deal.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.597
It has to stop
eventually, right?

10:49.775 --> 10:52.016
lt slowed down
quite a bit already.

10:56.615 --> 10:57.946
If we can get him
through this--

10:58.116 --> 11:00.368
When we get him
through this.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.073
--we'll need crutches.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.238
Right now we could use
some antibiotics

11:05.415 --> 11:08.907
and painkillers,
some sterile gauze.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.667
There's got to be
an infirmary here.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.954
If there is,
we'll find it.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.623
You've gotta be worried sick
about delivering the baby.

11:16.802 --> 11:20.215
Look at me.
Do I look worried?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.093
You look disgusting.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.509
( laughs)
So do you.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.476
We'll get through this.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.275
Pantry's back here.

11:37.698 --> 11:41.111
You never tried
to break out of here?

11:41.285 --> 11:43.617
Yeah, we tried to take
the doors off.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.368
But if you make
one peep in here,

11:45.539 --> 11:47.245
then those freaks'll be
lined up outside the door

11:47.416 --> 11:49.452
growling,
trying to get in.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.368
Windows got bars on there
that He-Man couldn't get through.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.752
Bigger than a 5x8.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.128
Big Tiny:
You won't find me complaining.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.541
Doing 15. My left leg can barely fit
on one of those bunks.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.335
Oscar: Yeah, they don't call him
Big Tiny for nothing.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.219
You donejerking
each other off?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.472
Sick of waiting
back here.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.288
This what you call
a little bit of food?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.828
- Goes fast.
- Mm-hmm.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.418
You can have a bag of corn,
some tuna fish--

12:38.592 --> 12:41.334
We said half.
That's the deal.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.378
- What's in there?
- Oscar: Don't open that.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.343
- ( coughing, gagging)
-( laughing)

12:47.517 --> 12:49.018
He wanted to know.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.473
Can't wait for
my own pot to piss in.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.603
( wheezing )

13:09.331 --> 13:12.539
It was stupid of us
to let him go.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.460
We cleared this whole cell block,
just the five of us.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.043
It could have
happened to anyone.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.635
What are we gonna
do without him?

13:25.806 --> 13:28.923
Hey, stop it.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.683
- All right? Stop it.
- ( sighs )

13:31.853 --> 13:34.936
He's still here.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.849
What if he does wake up?

13:39.403 --> 13:41.860
Then what?
He can't even walk.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.861
All we do is run.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.897
Hey...

13:46.076 --> 13:49.068
this won't break him.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.577
Okay?

13:50.747 --> 13:53.238
He's got you and Beth.

13:53.417 --> 13:57.080
Am I the only person
living in reality here?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.047
We've been through
so much already.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.708
You're expecting it, too.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.261
I'm not expecting,
all right?

14:08.432 --> 14:11.344
I'm just preparing.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.849
Why don't you go
check on Beth?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.011
Go on.
I'll watch him.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.435
(sighs)

14:35.000 --> 14:36.160
What are you doing?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.540
He's gonna have a hard time
walking around

14:37.711 --> 14:41.044
with one side of his pants
dragging on the ground.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.250
You know, he could
trip or something.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.045
There's a good chance
he won't wake up.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.759
Why are you so eager
to give up on him?

14:51.933 --> 14:53.309
I'm not giving up on him.

14:53.477 --> 14:56.139
It sure sounds like it.

14:56.313 --> 15:00.272
I don't want you to get
your hopes too high.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.933
We're not equipped to deal
with something like this.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.654
- We have Carol.
- She's not a doctor.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.201
Dad taught her a few things
to help with the baby.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.199
She stopped
the bleeding.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.034
These'll do just fine.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.543
- T-Dog: Food's here.
- What you got?

15:25.717 --> 15:29.926
Canned beef, canned corn,
canned cans.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.338
There's a lot more
where this came from.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.847
Any change?

15:34.017 --> 15:36.724
Bleeding is under control
and no fever,

15:36.895 --> 15:39.978
but his breath is labored
and his pulse is way down

15:40.148 --> 15:42.890
and he hasn't opened
his eyes yet.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.810
Take my cuffs,
put them on him.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.319
I'm not taking
any chances.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.114
Yeah.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.574
So what about
those prisoners?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.364
( sighs )
We're gonna help them

15:59.543 --> 16:00.953
clear out their
own cell block,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.619
and then they'll be there
and we'll be here.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.539
- Living beside each other.
- I'm not giving up this prison.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.002
Do they have guns?

16:09.177 --> 16:12.294
| only saw one.

16:12.472 --> 16:17.182
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.809
Well, what are your options?

16:22.399 --> 16:25.687
Kill them.

16:25.861 --> 16:29.194
If that's what
you think is best.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.856
You s--
you say this now...

16:34.828 --> 16:36.443
Look, I know that
I'm a shitty wife

16:36.621 --> 16:39.408
and I'm not winning
any Mother of the Year awards,

16:43.003 --> 16:45.460
but I need you
to know that...

16:47.883 --> 16:51.842
not for one second do I think
there is malice in your heart.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.175
You're not a killer,
and I know that.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.266
I know that, so--

17:02.480 --> 17:05.267
so do whatever you gotta do
to keep this group safe.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.353
And do it with
a clear conscience.

17:23.251 --> 17:27.369
Why do I need this
when I got this?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.287
Daryl:
You don't fire guns,

17:29.466 --> 17:31.957
not unless your back's
up against a wall.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.591
Noise attracts them.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.128
It really riles them up.

17:36.306 --> 17:40.299
We'll go in two by two.
Daryl will run point with T.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.513
I'll bring up
the rear with you.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.678
Stay tight,
hold formation

17:44.856 --> 17:46.892
no matter how close
the walkers get.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.853
Anyone breaks ranks,
we could all go down.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.608
Anyone runs off,

17:50.779 --> 17:52.815
they could get mistaken
for a walker,

17:52.989 --> 17:54.820
end up with an axe
to the head.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.447
And that's
where you aim.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.483
These things only go down
with a head shot.

18:01.665 --> 18:05.328
They ain't men.
They're something else.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.460
Just remember to go
for the brain.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.006
( keys jangle )

18:18.640 --> 18:19.925
What's going on?

18:20.100 --> 18:23.968
- We had to.
- It's just a precaution.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.770
You think maybe I could have
a minute alone here?

18:31.945 --> 18:33.810
Yeah, you want me to--?

18:33.989 --> 18:37.823
No, just by myself.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.075
Carol:
Of course.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.864
I'll be right outside.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.983
Dad...

19:21.619 --> 19:23.655
you don't have
to fight anymore.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.244
If you're worried
about me and Beth, don't.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.583
Don't worry about us.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.963
We'll take care of each other.
We'll look out.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.753
Me, Beth, and Glenn
will look out.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.687
Go ahead, Dad.
It's okay.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.195
Be peaceful.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.277
You don't have to fight.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.330
If it's time to go,
it's okay.

20:15.298 --> 20:19.291
Daddy, ljust want
to thank you.

20:22.305 --> 20:25.138
For everything,
thank you.

20:32.148 --> 20:35.140
( kisses )

21:04.514 --> 21:06.345
Man, it's too
damn dark in here.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.381
Gotta hold it up high
out in front of you.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.267
You're gonna hear them
before you see them.

21:18.319 --> 21:21.447
- It's coming!
- Rick: Shh!

21:22.699 --> 21:26.442
(snarling )

21:37.547 --> 21:39.538
(yelling)

21:51.394 --> 21:53.430
You wanna taste me?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.918
( door creaks, clangs )

22:26.721 --> 22:28.677
I thought you were
organizing the food.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.935
Even better.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.428
Check it out.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.938
-(gaspS)
- Where did you get this?

22:39.108 --> 22:40.848
Found the infirmary.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.018
Wasn't much left,
but I cleared it out.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.403
- You went by yourself?
- Yeah.

22:45.573 --> 22:46.983
Are you crazy?

22:47.158 --> 22:49.535
No big deal.
I killed two walkers.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.070
You-- all right,
do you see this?

22:53.248 --> 22:55.159
This was with
the whole group.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.948
We needed supplies,
so I got them.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.787
- I appreciate that, but--
- Then get off my back.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.953
Carl!

23:01.130 --> 23:03.963
She's your mother.
You can't talk to her like that.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.384
Listen, I think it's great
that you wanna help--

23:16.896 --> 23:18.727
It's gotta be the brain.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.311
Not the stomach,
not the heart-- the brain.

23:22.485 --> 23:26.398
I hear you.
The brain.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.564
- Like that?
- Uh-huh.

23:35.373 --> 23:38.365
Stay in tight formation.
No more prison riot crap.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.820
Tomas:
Get him!

24:11.868 --> 24:13.859
(snarling )

24:23.546 --> 24:25.332
Ah!

24:47.236 --> 24:51.400
These bandages will help
prevent infection.

24:51.574 --> 24:52.905
It's good.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.988
It's good that he taught you
all this stuff.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.744
He didn't teach me
everything.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.376
I need your help
with something.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.423
- What is it?
- Not here.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.754
I can't leave Hershel.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.090
- This is important.
- Carol, I can't--

25:15.264 --> 25:17.095
- Go on. We got it.
- Glenn: No way.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.427
- We'll be fine.
- We're not gonna be gone long.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.264
- Rick said for me--
- We're fine.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.233
All right.

25:37.328 --> 25:40.195
I'm telling you, I don't feel anything.
lt'sjust a scratch.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.034
- I'm sorry, man.
- I can keep fighting!

25:42.208 --> 25:44.290
You cut that old guy's leg
off to save his life.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.576
- Look at where the bite is.
- Guys, I'm fine!

25:46.754 --> 25:49.666
Just-- I'm fine.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.298
Look at me-- I'm not changing
into one of those things.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.174
Oscar: Look, man, there has to be
something we can do.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.301
- We could just lock him up.
- Quarantine him.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.963
We gotta do something.
Why you just standing there?

25:59.142 --> 26:01.133
- We gotta save him.
- There's nothing we can do.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.141
You son of a bitch.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.974
I'm all ri--

26:45.813 --> 26:47.804
(walkers snarling )

26:54.530 --> 26:56.191
Carol:
That one.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.700
Everything you're saying
is completely sane.

27:04.874 --> 27:09.243
You're wanting to use a walker
for practice is a sane thing.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.956
I mean it, okay.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.497
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to wrap my mind around it.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.417
Carol:
Lori's overdue.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.335
She had Carl by C-section.

27:19.514 --> 27:21.880
She's probably gonna have
to have this one the same way.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.390
Hershel had a little bit of
experience with this kind of thing,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.551
but he's not gonna
be able to do it anymore.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.060
I need experience

27:28.231 --> 27:30.597
and we have
plenty of cadavers.

27:32.401 --> 27:36.189
All right, well, like I said,
it's completely sane.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.029
I need to learn
how to cut through

27:39.200 --> 27:41.156
the abdomen and the uterus
without cutting the baby.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.409
Why not?

27:45.748 --> 27:47.409
I'll do it.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.034
Okay.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.595
Come on.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.758
Hey, follow me.
Come on.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.219
Right here, come on.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.729
Follow me.
That's right.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.639
There we go.
Come on!

28:31.419 --> 28:33.626
You see the look
on his face?

28:33.796 --> 28:37.789
He makes one move,
just give me a signal.

28:55.693 --> 28:58.526
(walkers snarling )

29:09.290 --> 29:11.906
- I ain't opening that.
- Yes, you are.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.665
If you want
this cell block,

29:13.836 --> 29:15.667
you're gonna open
that door.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.830
Just the one,
not both of them.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.545
Because we need
to control this.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.521
You bitches ready?

29:49.497 --> 29:50.953
I got this.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.700
- I said one door!
- Shit happens.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.109
T, mind the gap.

30:36.627 --> 30:40.870
- It was coming at me, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.754
| get it.

30:44.093 --> 30:46.300
Shit happens.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.393
No!

30:59.567 --> 31:01.603
Ah!

31:01.777 --> 31:03.108
Easy, now.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.605
lgot him.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.276
Man, get down
on your knees.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.989
We don't have no affiliation
to what just happened.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.498
Tell him, Oscar.

31:17.668 --> 31:20.330
Stop talking, man.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.684
( door opens)

32:01.796 --> 32:03.707
Let me back in, man.
Let me back in!

32:03.881 --> 32:05.872
Open it up, man!
Open up!

32:06.050 --> 32:08.382
- Open up.
- You'd better run.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.506
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Andrew screaming )

32:17.019 --> 32:19.010
(screaming continues)

32:21.107 --> 32:23.098
( screaming stops )

32:31.408 --> 32:33.399
(snoring softly )

32:52.054 --> 32:55.046
( breathing stops)

33:08.362 --> 33:09.863
What's happening?

33:15.119 --> 33:16.950
Do something!

33:17.121 --> 33:20.238
Somebody help!
Somebody!

33:20.416 --> 33:22.907
Please help!

33:39.435 --> 33:40.595
Come on.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.226
Come on.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.149
Come on.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.437
- ( Hersh
el gas
- No! I35 )

33:53.616 --> 33:56.278
- Lori--
- ( gasping )

33:58.913 --> 34:01.780
(snoring softly )

34:13.177 --> 34:14.633
We didn't have nothing
to do with that.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.966
You didn't know? You knew.
Daryl, let's end this now.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.131
Sir, please!
Please, listen to me!

34:20.309 --> 34:21.924
It was them that was bad.
It wasn't us.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.935
- Oh, that's convenient.
- You saw what he did to Tiny.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.312
He was my friend.

34:27.483 --> 34:30.441
Please, we ain't like that.

34:30.611 --> 34:33.478
I like my pharmaceuticals,
but I'm no killer.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.396
Oscar here,
he's a B and E,

34:35.574 --> 34:37.485
and he ain't very good
at it neither.

34:37.660 --> 34:40.072
We ain't the violent kind,
they were!

34:40.246 --> 34:44.489
Please, I swear to God!
I wanna live!

34:57.846 --> 34:59.177
What about you?

34:59.348 --> 35:03.182
I ain't never pleaded
for my life.

35:03.352 --> 35:06.719
And I ain't about
to start now.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.013
So you do
what you gotta do.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.113
Oh, man.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.835
Axel:
I knew these guys.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.966
These were good men.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.884
Let's go.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.049
Oscar: So you're just gonna
leave us in here?

35:45.227 --> 35:47.889
- Man, this is sick.
- We're locking down this cell block.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.520
From now on, this part
of the prison is yours.

35:50.691 --> 35:53.558
Take it or leave it.
That was the deal.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.440
You think this is sick?

35:57.614 --> 35:59.320
You don't wanna know
what's outside.

36:00.576 --> 36:04.615
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.904
Sorry about
your friends, man.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.714
A word of advice--

36:17.718 --> 36:20.710
take those bodies outside
and burn them.

36:29.438 --> 36:32.145
(door clangs)

36:42.159 --> 36:43.319
( footsteps )

36:43.494 --> 36:45.826
Hershel stopped
breathing.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.284
- Mom saved him.
- It's true.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.587
Still no fever.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.851
Daddy?

37:58.986 --> 38:01.443
Daddy.

38:01.613 --> 38:05.526
( Beth laughs)

38:05.701 --> 38:07.441
Daddy.

38:44.615 --> 38:47.527
( Beth crying )

39:02.049 --> 39:03.630
Come here.

39:45.968 --> 39:48.960
( rustling )

40:00.524 --> 40:02.515
( breathing )

40:23.213 --> 40:25.625
We'll start cleaning
tomorrow.

40:25.799 --> 40:30.589
Yeah. Yeah, we'll give
Carl a safe place to...

40:30.762 --> 40:33.925
do whatever he does
these days.

40:36.685 --> 40:40.428
For the record, |-- I don't
think you're a bad mother.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.187
Well, wife
is a different story.

40:50.324 --> 40:52.906
For better or worse, right?

40:55.037 --> 40:56.698
I mean, what are
we gonna do-- hire lawyers

40:56.872 --> 40:59.864
and get divorced
and split our assets?

41:01.710 --> 41:05.703
We got food. Hershel's alive.
Today was a good day.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.129
He'd be dead
if it weren't for you.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.964
You're the one
that acted fast.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.221
If you hadn't done
what you did, then...

41:25.776 --> 41:29.268
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.817
Maybe there's nothing
to talk about anymore.

41:54.596 --> 41:57.713
We're awful grateful
for what you did.

42:22.958 --> 42:22.992

42:22.999 --> 42:26.127
