WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.034
[Aaron] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:03.170 --> 00:05.582
You're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.340
-Really?
-Really.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.714
Dr. Frost, we need our best and brightest.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.757
-Can I count on you?
-Of course.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.050
Thank you for everything you've done.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.891
You're welcome, sir.
There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.760
I'm tired of giving assurances
to get things done.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.386
Your unauthorized back-channeling

00:22.523 --> 00:24.230
-has been going on for quite some time.
-Tom!

00:24.358 --> 00:26.645
You have been standing behind me,
undermining my authority.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.940
Your services are no longer required.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.783
[indistinct chatter]

00:52.219 --> 00:54.631
[siren wailing]

01:11.154 --> 01:12.110
[Aaron] Good morning, Mr. President.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.196
No, Aaron, it's not. What the hell happened?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.816
East Hun Chiu just conducted
an unannounced missile test

01:16.952 --> 01:18.067
over West Hun Chiu.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.615
The missile landed harmlessly
in the South China Sea.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.489
There's nothing harmless about
a missile test on the day of a summit.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.707
-What was Chairman Kim thinking?
-[Covell] Saber-rattling.

01:25.836 --> 01:29.420
A show of might calculated to increase
his negotiational leverage at the summit.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.630
He may have leveraged himself into a war.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.250
Good news is West Hun Chiu's President Han
IS reasonable.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.878
[Tom] She won't be reasonable
staring down the barrel of a gun.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.176
West Hun Chiu's staring down
more than that.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.470
There's half a million troops
on the East Hun Chiu border.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.559
And 300,000 in West Hun Chiu.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.394
-What about our troops?
-[Covell] 50,000.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.638
It's part of our mutual security pact
with West Hun Chiu.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.230
They're embedded with their forces.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.317
We sent them there as advisors.
Now they're in the line of fire?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.561
Sitting ducks, sir.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.689
5,000 East Hun Chiu missiles just a few miles
away, pointed right at them.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.327
Our troops are stuck in the middle

01:58.452 --> 02:00.489
of the largest concentration
of enemy combatants in the world.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.907
All of who are on war footing.

02:02.039 --> 02:05.748
-If anyone shoots across to the DMZ--
-Are the delegations here?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.241
Han and her team arrived Monday.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.584
Chairman Kim and his entourage
just got in this morning.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.045
Pass the word.
The summit's been moved up.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.960
| want everybody at Camp David
in three hours.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.344
Yes, sir.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.502
East Hun Chiu's official statement is that

02:18.639 --> 02:21.097
only Chairman Kim can comment
on military maneuvers.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.886
And he's got nothing to say
until the summit.

02:24.019 --> 02:27.683
Why did we allow a rogue nation
to have a consulate here?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.430
It was a gesture of peace and goodwill

02:29.566 --> 02:31.933
designed to bring East Hun Chiu
into the brotherhood of nations.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.310
-[Tom] How's that working out?
-Not well.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.529
-[Tom] Seth, you're gonna have a busy day.
-[Seth] It just got busier, Mr. President.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.617
Simon Day at the Chronicle posted this piece
about our confidential internal ethics review.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.533
-Son of a bitch. Another leak?
-I'm afraid so.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.781
-How many is that?
-Six since September.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.909
Someone is trying
to undermine this administration.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.332
-Emily, take care of this.
-I'll find them.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.580
-Whatever it takes.
-Yes, sir.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.333
-Marine One within the hour.
-On it, sir.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.382
[anchor] East Hun Chiu's
notoriously volatile Chairman Kim

03:01.515 --> 03:03.301
took the world by surprise this morning

03:03.433 --> 03:06.300
when he launched a missile test
off the coast of West Hun Chiu.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.972
You know why I hate Wednesdays?

03:08.105 --> 03:10.142
The unsettling prospect
of catastrophic war?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.058
Yep.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.647
-[Lyor speaks Hun Chiuese]
-There's another reason.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.642
It means "howdy"
in the West Hun Chiu dialect,

03:14.778 --> 03:17.645
-but "potato” in the East Hun Chiu one.
-Fascinating.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.318
There are 200 words for potato
in East Hun Chiuese.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.067
Half the population's starving,
so they're obsessed with food.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.659
You know they sleep eight to a room?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.779
No. Luckily, you two
only have to double up.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.326
Sorry?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.835
Given the size of the delegation

03:29.960 --> 03:31.792
and that half of Camp David
is under renovation,

03:31.920 --> 03:35.413
accommodations are tight.
So you boys are bunkies.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.086
- I call dibs.
-[cell phone chimes]

03:39.219 --> 03:40.801
-On what?
-[Lyor] Everything.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.295
Kendra needs us.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.348
These are your W60-3s.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.309
-Is that some type of lubricant?
-[Kendra] Metaphorically, yes.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.270
I'm trying to smooth things out
for you two.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.935
Your relationship disclosure forms.
| need them pronto.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.479
Can you remind me
why we need to submit these?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.602
The White House
has a non-fraternization policy,

03:58.739 --> 04:00.446
which one can opt out of by filling out--

04:00.574 --> 04:02.030
W60-3.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.527
Circle gets the square.
Think of it as an insurance policy.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.949
Seth can't file a lawsuit
for sexual harassment.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.116
-What?
-Theoretically.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.115
Because he's your subordinate.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.834
-You're joking.
-I'm not.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.953
Neither are our insurance adjusters.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.704
| didn't realize
this was an insurance issue.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.297
It's a simple prophylactic.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.337
-[both groan]
-Sorry. Poor choice of words.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.883
There's been no harassment.
I... I want that to go on the record.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.849
Thank you, Seth. Just get them back to me
by the end of the day.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.718
That way no one gets sued or deposed.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.061
Our insurance adjusters are happy.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.430
The world's gone mad.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.515
Thank you.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.293
Put this on.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.709
Put your hand down before I break it.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.548
The person you want to meet

05:01.676 --> 05:04.168
is about to become the biggest defector
in East Hun Chiu's history.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.510
He's justifiably anxious.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.052
And given this morning's missile test,
his value to you just skyrocketed.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.549
This is non-negotiable.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.810
And I need your Bluetooth.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.563
Do not give him your Bluetooth.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.902
Hannah, do you hear me? Wait.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.695
Damnit, Hannah!

05:30.247 --> 05:33.080
[Lyor] Your comments have to be run
through Aaron's security filter.

05:33.208 --> 05:33.993
[Seth] Obviously.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.287
And my "Seth's not allowed
to make our boss

05:36.419 --> 05:37.750
look like Neville Chamberlain" filter.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.495
-Only if you kill me.
-[Gregory] Lyor?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.378
Huh. Thought I might run into you here.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.421
Uh, this is quite a surprise.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.420
| didn't know you were retained
by President Han.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.924
-Actually, I work for Chairman Kim.
-[Lyor laughs]

05:51.059 --> 05:53.471
Good one.
Seth Wright, this is Greg Bowen.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.219
-Nice to meet you.
-And you.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.811
| admire your work.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.647
-Thank you.
-[Gregory] Funny factoid.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.234
You're the third White House
press secretary named Seth.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.479
-That's interesting.
- I thought so.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.074
And, Lyor, I actually am working
for Chairman Kim.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.491
Wow. If I'd known you were hard up enough
to sleep with the enemy,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.000
| would've offered you a job.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.164
-The chairman's not England's enemy.
-Well, he's humanity's enemy.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.711
And England is subsumed by humanity.
Except when it comes to food.

06:23.842 --> 06:28.587
Well, uh, if you'll excuse me,
| need to go find some hand sanitizer.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.554
Whole lotta shaking going on.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.635
How do you know that guy?

06:36.938 --> 06:38.929
We go back a ways.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.932
Started out together
working for Governor Hammond.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.183
He's a hack.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.311
-It's amazing.
-What?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.654
You don't see it?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.566
-See what?
-[chuckles] Never mind.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.156
| would like to thank Chairman Kim
and President Han

06:54.289 --> 06:57.247
for their participation
in these landmark negotiations.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.707
This is a dangerous moment.

06:59.836 --> 07:03.204
Our goal has to be to create
lasting peace for both countries.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.208
Mr. President, West Hun Chiu
appreciates your intervention.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.713
But East Hun Chiu has threatened us
with annihilation for too many years.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.933
And today's provocation
brings us to the brink of war.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.474
| don't think Chairman Kim wants that,
otherwise he wouldn't be here.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.019
We don't seek war. Only security.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.735
We suffer under the collusion of the West
against my tiny country

07:26.863 --> 07:28.479
at the behest of President Han.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.990
Chairman Kim, you do not need
to fear the West nor your neighbor.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.701
That depends on these negotiations,
doesn't it?

07:35.705 --> 07:39.573
You are right, Mr. President.
This is a dangerous moment.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.995
| promised my people

07:41.127 --> 07:43.539
| would leave this summit
with a safer East Hun Chiu.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.881
And that will happen,
one way or the other.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.381
Then I suggest we get started.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.522
It's not safe here.
You were probably followed.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.236
By people loyal to you.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.321
Who were trying to protect me.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.491
The United States can do that now.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.152
[Joon] You can try.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.704
But my minders will be looking for me.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.794
They'll soon realize I'm gone.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.085
That is why the information
you could give us is so important.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.878
It can change everything.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.798
I'll start with this.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.924
My father is
East Hun Chiu Chairman Kyung Kim.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.600
And if he finds me here with you,
we're both dead.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.435
[theme music playing]

08:58.955 --> 09:00.286
[Tom] Two hours of speeches.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.998
Chairman Kim rattling on
about reunification,

09:03.126 --> 09:06.494
complaining about sanctions
and US troop presence. It was endless.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.915
President Han's not helping.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.086
Accusing him of possessing nukes,
which may or may not be true.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.834
We need to restore the status quo
before we can talk peace.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.632
And we need to get East Hun Chiu
to stop testing missiles.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.972
And West Hun Chiu has to stop
mobilizing troops.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.761
Where are we at with Kim's son?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.181
The asset's been secured.
He's being debriefed.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.351
If the chairman finds out
what we're up to, we're his enemy, too.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.852
-I'd put that kid on the next plane to Bali.
-[Aaron] I disagree. Joon Kim's an insider.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.319
He can give us information
about the nuclear program

09:33.448 --> 09:35.189
we could use to leverage his father.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.362
-Assuming there is a program.
-The kid can tell us.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.111
Unfortunately, you're both right.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.113
But the kid's too valuable
an asset not to mine.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.367
If this blows up in our faces,
it was my call.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.664
Let's do it. Fast.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.911
Yes, sir.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.805
We need details
of your father's nuclear program.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.342
| will answer all your questions.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.930
But I need something, too.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.050
We already extracted you.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.893
But not my girlfriend.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.352
She's at the compound.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.142
She wasn't part of the deal.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.394
| had to see
whether you can protect me first.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.397
Now that I know you can,
you have to protect her.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.491
Joon, you're not in a position
to be making demands.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.326
I'm not demanding.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.075
| am begging.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.292
I'm here because my brothers are dead.
My uncles, too.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.036
They loved my father, just like I do.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.542
But he is paranoid.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.754
Decided one day they were all disloyal.

10:36.886 --> 10:41.722
Then tied them to posts
and fired an anti-aircraft gun at them.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.885
I'm sorry.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.725
-But this isn't about them.
-No, it's not.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.894
It's about Jung-Min.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.900
What do you think my father will do
to her when he learns I defected?

10:54.028 --> 10:59.273
Once my girlfriend and I are safe,
| will tell you what you want to know.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.399
Not before.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.364
[Tom] Reach out to Dr. Andrea Frost
from Apache Aerospace for me.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.251
[Aaron] What for, sir?

11:08.376 --> 11:12.620
We're trying to use Kim's son for leverage.
| won't put all our eggs in one basket.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.622
East and West Hun Chiu
are locked in an arms race.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.624
The longer the build-up,
the greater the threat.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.262
She might be our ace in the hole.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.095
Her company specializes in
state of the art missile defense systems.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.055
That technology could be used to ease tensions.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.642
Convince them
to focus on mutual protection

11:26.769 --> 11:29.557
rather than mutual destruction,
we may get our breakthrough.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.600
Right. Do what you must to get her here.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.269
-On it, sir.
-Thank you.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.774
[scoffs] Look at him.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.107
And?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.944
He's a misanthrope, Seth.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.658
A socially malformed introverted creature
incapable of meaningful human connection.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.295
Have you ever seen anything so pathetic?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.922
You should put some on.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.004
Honestly, that is how you get skin cancer.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.044
And that's lunch.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.838
You want all White House staff
to get this questionnaire?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.009
Yes.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.849
Em, this reads like a witch hunt.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.843
I'm not accusing anybody.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.971
You're asking
for notarized declarations of loyalty.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.518
There are no First Amendment rights

12:14.651 --> 12:16.858
when it comes to the
leaking of classified information.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.364
It's not a constitutional issue.
It's a perception one.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.527
The president says this is a priority.
So the mole will lie about the leaks.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.367
Once the questionnaire is notarized,
we've got them on perjury.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.738
Let me make it less Torquemada,
then you can send it out.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.114
-Great.
-Form central here, right?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.538
That's for everyone.
Let's talk about yours.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.128
Right. The W60-3.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.418
-I really need it... Excuse me.
-[phone beeps]

12:38.549 --> 12:39.675
Yes?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.097
Okay. Thanks.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.509
Is this Seth's declaration?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.845
Yes. He just got it to me.
That's why I wanted yours.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.218
| didn't want you reading his.

12:51.354 --> 12:55.643
He says that we've been
intermittently associating for six months.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.483
That's how he defines our relationship?
I'm an intermittent association?

12:58.611 --> 13:01.148
This is an office document,
not a valentine.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.863
| don't like being under a microscope.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.153
Privacy isn't a big issue
at the White House.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.902
We submit to random drug tests,
FBI interviews.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.493
This is just a form.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.865
That tells the world
I'm Seth's intermittent associate.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.242
That's not how I want to be defined.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.585
Define however you want.
Just get me that form.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.204
[sighs]

13:26.472 --> 13:28.588
Seth, Kendra.

13:28.725 --> 13:32.309
You may want to revise your WG60-3.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.429
Dr. Frost, thank you very much for coming.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.806
It's an honor.
I've never been to Camp David.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.183
You're gonna get a crash course
in diplomacy.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.108
Don't say "crash" to someone
who just flew in on Marine One.

13:43.239 --> 13:47.198
Helicopters are a lot like diplomacy.
You have to get used to the turbulence.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.160
[Tom] Chairman Kim, President Han.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.531
This is Dr. Andrea Frost
from Apache Aerospace.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.122
We've met.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.286
[Kim] We haven't.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.787
"Cause US law forbids us from doing business
with defense contractors.

13:59.922 --> 14:04.587
Which is why I'm prepared to sign an executive
order exempting Apache from that law.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.757
-President Kirkman--
-A limited purpose exception.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.051
We're ready to roll out
a new air defense system.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.426
A next-gen Iron Dome.
It's called Ricochet.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.474
It can take down 98%
of all incoming missiles.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.769
We'd like you both to have it,
to ensure your safety from each other.

14:19.901 --> 14:23.360
My country is impoverished.
How are we going to afford it?

14:23.488 --> 14:26.981
We were hoping that West Hun Chiu
would cover the up-front cost.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.698
We cannot do that.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.820
You can, and you will
if you want my country's military support.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.243
It's not a gift.
We'll structure a repayment schedule,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.243
so East Hun Chiu can pay you in full
with interest.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.835
In exchange for your generosity,

14:40.963 --> 14:44.456
East Hun Chiu will halt its nuclear program
and allow inspection.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.176
We have no nuclear program.
That is West Hun Chiu propaganda.

14:48.304 --> 14:52.263
Then allow the inspections,
and maybe we can reconsider sanctions.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.931
I'll need to consult with my delegation.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.100
Please do. Both of you.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.682
Excuse us.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.156
[Andrea] Thank you.

15:12.578 --> 15:17.038
So apparently, the preliminary word is that
both sides are amenable to the proposal.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.372
Thank you. I am grateful.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.290
So is my company. $14 billion contract.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.288
| wouldn't get too excited yet.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.382
You'll owe us five-and-a-half billion back
in taxes. [chuckles]

15:28.553 --> 15:29.918
[Aaron] Mr. President.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.886
You have to see this, sir.

15:32.014 --> 15:36.133
It's a stunning development that could lead to
a breakthrough between the two enemies.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.728
The Kirkman initiative, as it's called,
is a last-ditch effort to avoid...

15:39.856 --> 15:40.891
How did this get out?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.730
[Seth] It was posted 20 minutes ago.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.395
Each side has already released a statement

15:44.527 --> 15:46.234
blaming the other
for trying to torpedo the deal.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.525
[Aaron] West Hun Chiu just mobilized
200,000 reserve troops.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.273
And we've got 50,000 American troops

15:51.409 --> 15:53.901
stuck in the middle
of the volatile situation on earth.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.448
We gotta get the delegations
back to the table.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.787
Right now.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.872
[anchor] ...on both sides of the border
continue to mass,

16:00.001 --> 16:02.709
pushing this corner of the world closer...

16:05.298 --> 16:08.211
Throw the Chronicle a bone.
Give them a suspect,

16:08.342 --> 16:11.175
so they stop with the conspiracy theories
about the leak.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.762
But we can't blame the administration
or either delegation.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.678
So the culprit must be
an anonymous Camp David staffer.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.220
Someone who went through the trash

16:18.352 --> 16:20.093
-and has gone AWOL.
-[cell phone ringing]

16:20.229 --> 16:21.219
-Seth Wright.
-Good.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.439
[softly] This is an absolute disaster.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.557
What was that?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.901
This is an absolute disaster, Lyor.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.648
We're closer to war now
than we were before the summit started.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.445
That's why both parties are being
brought back to the table.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.819
Maybe it should be a different table.

16:42.043 --> 16:47.038
You don't care which table you're at,
as long as someone else foots the bill.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.880
Same as you, Lyor.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.922
We're troubadours. We go from town
to town and we sing for our supper.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.421
But I stay for dessert.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.965
Because this is Bushido.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.135
There's a code.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.259
You sign on to something, you finish the job.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.729
After all this time, you're still cross
about Governor Hammond?

17:04.857 --> 17:07.645
-Yes, we all are.
-He was a loser, Lyor.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.439
Don't blame me
for working it out before you.

17:10.570 --> 17:14.155
| blame you for bailing.
For leaving before the job was done.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.615
Because that's not what men do.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.486
They stick. And they fight.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.114
And go down with the ship.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.992
If that's your thing, uh, Davy Jones,
keep at it.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.995
Because I've seen
your guy's approval ratings.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.589
| know where your ship's heading.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.221
[Emily] Thank you for coming in, Simon.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.933
The president has the greatest respect
for your journalism.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.929
Why do I feel being hauled before
his Chief of Staff is a strange way to show it?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.851
This is an extraordinary situation.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.316
We're trying to avert
a global catastrophe.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.027
-That has nothing to do with me.
-Actually, it does.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.022
You have been reporting
confidential information

17:56.158 --> 17:57.660
that endangers a peace process.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.150
Ever heard of the Pentagon Papers?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.290
The Supreme Court's not big
on prior restraint.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.374
September 27th, October 13th
and November 23rd.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.743
All scoops based on your secret source.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.790
-It's called journalism.
-Shoddy journalism.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.381
A lot of that information was classified
until you published it.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.968
[sighs] Ms. Rhodes,
why don't you get to the point?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.463
Your source is a government employee
who's breaking the law.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.177
Even if you aren't.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.684
If you want continued access
to this White House,

18:24.812 --> 18:26.314
you will give me a name.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.733
You're too sophisticated to believe
that you could intimidate me.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.647
Which means you must be desperate.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.895
I'm not. I don't need this beat.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.400
I'm happy covering city politics
or writing movie reviews.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.492
And if the president
is so obsessed with loyalty,

18:41.621 --> 18:44.409
he might wanna inspire a little more
in his administration,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.531
so his people aren't calling me
with dirt on him.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.630
Both delegations are holed up
in their respective cabins,

18:54.759 --> 18:56.215
blaming each other for the leak,

18:56.344 --> 19:00.087
refusing to negotiate without unilateral
concessions from the other side.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.088
This has to be Chairman Kim.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.967
What reason would President Han have
for sabotaging the summit?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.685
The joint missile defense system

19:07.813 --> 19:10.271
would be considered a diplomatic triumph
for West Hun Chiu.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.936
Not if she's paying.
She's up for reelection.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.276
If she's helping the enemy,
her opponent will kill her.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.692
So she creates a public uproar,
gives her an excuse to walk away.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.816
The problem is East Hun Chiu had
just as much incentive to leak the story.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.365
From where I sit, a free missile defense system
looks like a pretty good deal.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.738
It's a great deal.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.740
Just not for a tyrant
whose hold on his people

19:28.876 --> 19:31.618
is based largely on the existence
of an enemy on its border.

19:31.754 --> 19:35.122
So you're saying without a threat,
his people will start looking at other things.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.248
Poverty, lack of medical care, no food.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.046
Conditions that are ripe for a coup.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.297
We're back to mutual distrust.
Both parties playing the blame game.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.718
We need to sweeten the pot.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.307
For both sides.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.944
-What are we looking at?
-[Chuck] The girl's in the south wing.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.991
-Options?
-Nothing good.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.205
Dozens of guards.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.118
Armed?

20:10.251 --> 20:12.834
-[Chuck] To the hilt. No way in.
-Yes, there is.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.543
The front door.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.880
-[central lock beeps]
-[car alarm wails]

20:23.431 --> 20:24.637
[guard grunts]

20:28.811 --> 20:30.802
[indistinct chatter]

20:36.485 --> 20:38.067
-[Hannah] Excuse me.
-Hey.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.651
[door unlocks]

20:49.749 --> 20:51.615
It's okay. Joon sent me.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.083
Joon is not feeling well.
He's asleep in his room.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.667
No, he's not.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.332
I'm going to scream.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.082
[Joon] Jung-Min,
this woman's name is Hannah.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.469
She's a friend.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.632
| can't explain now,
but you have to go with her. Please.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.346
We have to get out of here. Now!

21:09.310 --> 21:11.893
Your proposal is rejected,
President Kirkman.

21:12.021 --> 21:16.310
My government will not lend Chairman Kim's
brutal dictatorship one penny.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.934
We don't need your money. Or Ricochet.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.437
We have 1.5 million soldiers who can
defend against your aggressions.

21:22.573 --> 21:26.612
-This is not constructive.
-Correct, Mr. President. It's pointless.

21:26.744 --> 21:30.487
Which is why I'm prepared
to make one last proposal.

21:30.623 --> 21:35.242
Apache Aerospace will lease Ricochet
to East Hun Chiu for 30 years.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.505
The first payment will not be due till year ten.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.043
-I wasn't consulted on this.
-I'm consulting you now.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.165
No, you're dictating.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.510
You have no authority to negotiate
on behalf of my company.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.346
Right. But I do have the authority
to deny you government contracts

21:48.474 --> 21:50.966
for the foreseeable future
if you don't wanna do your part.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.387
This is a shakedown.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.263
No. This is the proper exercise
of a chief executive's authority.

21:56.398 --> 22:00.858
President Han, your country will not be
paying for East Hun Chiu's defense.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.147
Not one penny.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.613
But we'll be paying for our own.
That doesn't seem fair.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.733
[Tom] Your GDP is 75 times greater
than East Hun Chiu's.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.531
You want to avoid war,
this is a necessary step.

22:11.664 --> 22:16.374
Now, with regards to battery placements,
troop reductions and nuclear inspections,

22:16.502 --> 22:19.585
| believe we can agree
to negotiate those terms at a later time.

22:21.632 --> 22:22.918
In good faith.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.503
-Agreed.
-Agreed.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.502
Thank you. Both of you.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.220
We'll start drawing it up.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.184
[Mike] Sir, Dr. Frost is looking for you.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.894
Fine. Send her in.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.186
That worked like a charm.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.905
-And you are a very good actor.
-[chuckles] Thank you, sir.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.990
I'm in your debt.

22:50.119 --> 22:53.828
In more ways than one.
A ten-year, interest-free loan?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.492
We'll help you with that.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.992
Tax breaks, government contracts.
You'll make it up on the back end.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.495
I'm not actually worried, sir.

23:01.630 --> 23:05.123
| am curious, though.
How did you know your gambit would work?

23:05.801 --> 23:07.963
| didn't. I just hoped.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.006
[chuckles] Smart ploy.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.130
Gutsy one. And I'm a CEO.

23:12.266 --> 23:16.476
But all my decisions, I have to get advice
and consent from a board of directors.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.096
| get a lot of advice.
Unfortunately, the consent is mine.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.609
That sounds like the loneliest job
in the world.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.817
You wanna know the truth? I miss teaching.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.482
I'm better at instructing
than I am at deciding.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.105
How long were you a professor for?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.697
-14 years.
-Hmm.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.863
| was still teaching classes
when I started my firm.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.861
| never thought I'd give up my students.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.989
-Now you have 325 million of them.
-[both chuckle]

23:38.125 --> 23:41.083
| understand the attraction
of being a professor.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.623
My husband always said
he'd never do anything else.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.463
What does he teach?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.959
He taught classics,
but he passed away a year ago.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.045
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.047
It was out of the blue.

23:54.183 --> 23:57.016
We were in Maui,
and he was doing this triathlon.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.975
Turned out he had a heart defect.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.683
He used to say, when it's your time to go,

24:05.861 --> 24:07.818
sudden is the best way to do it.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.529
Not for the survivors.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.442
Chairman Kim needs to see you.
It's urgent.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.697
-Okay. Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.
-[Andrea softly] It's all right.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.383
Mr. Chairman, what is it?

24:28.217 --> 24:32.336
| wanted to tell you to your face.
My delegation and I are going home.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.929
When we land,
we will be at war with West Hun Chiu.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.765
Mr. Chairman, we have a deal.
What the hell has happened?

24:37.893 --> 24:41.727
My son is missing and
| believe West Hun Chiu has kidnapped him.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.406
Sir, you have to assure Chairman Kim
West Hun Chiu does not have his son.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.996
-Without telling that we have him.
-[Tom] No.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.287
I'm a father. I won't lie
to another man about his son.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.501
Fine, then don't lie. Bargain, sir.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.371
The kid's leverage. Use him
to compel the chairman's signature.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.465
That would make us kidnappers, Lyor!
Third-rate extortionists.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.460
We're an inch from war, Aaron.
| don't think how we avoid it matters.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.883
I'm afraid it does, Lyor.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.008
I'm not lying or using the kid
as a bargaining chip.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.479
| told you if this blew up in our faces,
it was my call.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.774
I'll take responsibility.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.280
[in Hun Chiuese]

25:42.416 --> 25:45.625
Mr. Chairman, now you know West Hun Chiu
does not have your son.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.369
No. You do.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.964
Yes. And as he explained,
he is not our captive.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.959
No. He is a traitor.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.675
-And I know how to deal with traitors.
-Mr. Chairman, please.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.343
You have a son, Mr. President.

26:00.476 --> 26:05.471
If you learned that he had taken refuge
in my country, how would you feel?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.437
| would be dismayed.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.724
Heartbroken.

26:11.445 --> 26:15.439
But I would have to accept his decision
if he made it of his own free will.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.281
[Han] And I hope, Chairman Kim,

26:17.409 --> 26:22.154
that you can put this matter aside
and conclude our negotiations.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.868
We have come so far.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.492
Yes. But we can go no further.

26:27.628 --> 26:31.246
Not as long as President Kirkman
presides over these negotiations.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.878
Because I no longer trust him.

26:35.677 --> 26:39.716
Mr. President, you know the respect
| have for you.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.465
But I must agree with Chairman Kim.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.184
If you have lost the confidence
of one of us,

26:45.312 --> 26:47.849
you've lost the confidence of both of us.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.981
[Aaron sighs]

26:55.114 --> 26:58.232
The only way forward
is to find an honest broker.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.028
One both sides can trust.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.074
Unfortunately, there's only one name
out there. Cornelius Moss.

27:04.206 --> 27:07.039
-[Tom] The man I fired.
-You think he'd help?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.875
There's only one way to find out.

27:11.547 --> 27:15.040
I'm never on this floor.
They never let me on this floor.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.552
Welcome to the big leagues.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.544
-We need your expertise.
-Happy to help.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.264
Is it possible to get a phone dump without
going through the usual channels?

27:23.392 --> 27:25.759
Sure. I know a few technical work-arounds.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.852
Good. I need phone records
on a reporter named Simon Day.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.767
When you say "usual channels,"

27:30.899 --> 27:34.108
you don't mean technical work-arounds,
do you?

27:34.236 --> 27:37.774
No. I mean I don't want you going through
a phone company or leaving a trail.

27:37.906 --> 27:41.115
But I need a warrant
if we're going after a reporter.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.278
Not if it's an emergency.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.526
We're trying to stop a war,

27:43.662 --> 27:46.620
and someone is leaking intel
about the summit to the Chronicle.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.126
The national security implications
of that are enormous.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.834
-I understand, but--
-This is a time-sensitive issue, Chuck.

27:51.962 --> 27:55.421
That's why we can't jump through
all of the usual procedural hoops.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.381
Can the president count on you?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.432
Sure.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.214
Thank you.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.316
Cornelius, thank you for coming.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.734
For the record, I'm not here for you.
I'm here for my country.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.823
Good. Your country needs you.

28:22.951 --> 28:26.114
We have a peace process that's faltering.
Stakes couldn't be higher.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.954
Let's see if we can't get
this trolley back on track.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.283
You both know President Moss.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.579
| asked him here to reassure you
that the US government

28:36.715 --> 28:38.331
can be an honest broker.

28:38.467 --> 28:42.176
But President Moss is no longer in charge.
You are.

28:42.304 --> 28:46.013
Chairman Kim, you and I have worked
together in the past, correct?

28:46.141 --> 28:48.974
Yes. But we didn't accomplish anything.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.354
No, we didn't.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.438
We made a good run at a peace deal,
but we came up short.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.357
But was I a man of my word?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.529
Yes.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.400
President Han, I know you well.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.119
-Have I ever let you down?
-No.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.455
Because my word is my bond.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.042
And I've never said anything
to either of you that was false.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.331
Although, on occasions,

29:16.463 --> 29:19.330
I've had to tell you both
things you did not want to hear.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.999
So now I tell the two of you this.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.179
President Kirkman
is also a man of his word.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.675
And if he promises you something,
he will deliver.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.136
And I will personally vouch for that.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.812
The man is offering you two a chance
to step back from oblivion.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.693
I'd grab it with both hands.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.821
Two presidents, a titan of industry.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.370
They get their own rooms. Aaron, too.
| get you.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.537
[Lyor] You're welcome.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.253
The deal will be signed in the morning.
I'm on the first SUV out.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.463
Correction. The deal may be signed
in the morning.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.753
A lot can go wrong between now and then.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.047
Especially with Greg Bowen
on the other side.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.920
Why don't you like that guy?

30:08.056 --> 30:10.434
I'd rather not talk about him.
It gives me acid reflux.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.721
Sort of like this
relationship declaration.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.096
-Yeah. Here. Give it here.
-Nope.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.098
You don't want advice from a guy
who's been happily married for 6 years?

30:19.234 --> 30:22.101
Happily married? You forgot you had a wife.
A wife you never see.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.023
Ergo the happily married part.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.272
Keep them at a remove.
That's the secret.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.944
[laughs] Thanks, Dr. Phil.
| think I'm good.

30:28.076 --> 30:28.907
[Lyor] Suit yourself.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.124
[Lyor humming]

30:38.670 --> 30:40.252
[machine whirring]

30:40.380 --> 30:41.962
-Seriously?
-Relax, don't worry.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.706
I've got something to drown it out.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.591
[soothing instrumental music playing]

30:54.227 --> 30:57.185
[man over speaker]
You are about to embark on a journey

30:57.314 --> 31:00.852
that will lead you to a deep
and satisfying sleep.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.780
[Hannah] We've rescued your girlfriend.
You've given us nothing.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.146
This is not good enough.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.899
Please. That's everything I know.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.244
There is nothing useful in here.
Nothing about the nuclear program.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.113
That's why we brought you here.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.081
Joon, what is it?

31:20.170 --> 31:21.626
What are you afraid of?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.046
Him.

31:24.174 --> 31:27.257
He can't hurt you now.
| promise you that.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.879
But if you don't talk to us,
he can hurt a lot of other people.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.138
He's not developing nuclear weapons.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.099
He already has them.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.113
And I can give you the coordinates.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.988
-[cell phone beeps]
-[line rings]

31:50.117 --> 31:52.279
This is Hannah Wells.
Get me the president.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.995
This is an installation of some sort.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.458
Three months ago, East Hun Chiu
disassembled whatever was here.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.371
-Moved it.
-Where?

32:02.504 --> 32:05.041
| had to do some pretty heavy lifting
to follow the breadcrumbs--

32:05.173 --> 32:09.087
Chuck, for once,
I... I need you to skip the preamble.

32:09.219 --> 32:12.211
The president has held off on signing
the treaty until he can get corroboration.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.759
Right. I don't have it. Not completely.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.724
Whatever that installation was,
it was relocated.

32:17.853 --> 32:21.016
29 degrees latitude.
122 degrees longitude.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.060
It's about two miles from the DMZ.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.057
[line ringing]

32:25.193 --> 32:27.230
Aaron, it's Hannah. You got a pen?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.864
[Kim] A revised treaty?

32:29.489 --> 32:32.072
Unacceptable!
We already approved the agreement.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.453
The previous agreement has been deemed
null and void

32:34.578 --> 32:38.116
because it was based on
material nondisclosure. Dr. Frost?

32:38.248 --> 32:40.580
This image is a recent satellite photo,

32:40.709 --> 32:43.872
taken in East Hun Chiu,
two miles from the DMZ.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.836
The ridges in the ground
are consistent

32:45.964 --> 32:49.002
with a concealed ICBM installation
for nuclear weapons.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.545
That is a lie.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.588
[Andrea] No, Chairman Kim. It's not.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.930
My company designs the projectiles
for those warheads.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.595
And the subterranean housing for them is
consistent with this topography.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.093
[Tom] In the new agreement,

33:01.229 --> 33:03.721
you are responsible
for dismantling the missiles.

33:03.857 --> 33:08.272
You will also allow a multinational
peacekeeping force to destroy the silos.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.020
A force that can make sure
you honor your promises.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.523
This is an outrage.

33:13.658 --> 33:17.117
What you won't find in the agreement
is that if you fail to comply,

33:17.245 --> 33:20.078
my country will see that
as a declaration of war.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.426
| want to thank you again for your help.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.599
It's my pleasure to serve, Mr. President.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.096
Please, call me Tom.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.603
May I speak freely, Tom?

33:49.277 --> 33:50.563
Of course.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.608
Our country is a beacon
of hope and virtue,

33:53.740 --> 33:56.448
but it's... it's isolated
on the world stage.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.407
Isolation isn't always a good thing.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.159
No. No, it isn't.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.459
-Thank you again, Dr. Frost.
-Yes.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.641
[Gregory] Congratulations.

34:23.603 --> 34:27.847
You should take your boy out for a drink.
He finally got one over on me.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.438
Is that what you really think?

34:29.568 --> 34:32.400
That the most important thing
to Lyor is beating you?

34:32.529 --> 34:35.190
Yes. Because he never has.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.815
| look at you two of you.
You're so much alike.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.909
-Except for one fundamental difference.
-Which is?

34:41.036 --> 34:43.824
You're a son of a bitch. And he's not.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.868
What did you just say?

34:46.001 --> 34:48.208
Governor Hammond,
| have a friend who knows him.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.952
He said you started a rumor

34:50.088 --> 34:53.170
that Hammond's campaign went south
because of Lyor's mistakes.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.007
Rumors that took Lyor years to get over.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.045
You know what Lyor said

34:57.178 --> 35:00.170
about the guy who abandoned the campaign
in its moment of need back then?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.848
-What?
-Nothing.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.138
Because he's a stand-up guy.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.228
He stood up for you, even when
you were trashing his reputation.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.018
So, yeah, you guys are nothing alike.

35:17.032 --> 35:20.570
-What did he want?
-He's licking his wounds. Dude's a hack.

35:20.702 --> 35:21.692
[Lyor] Hmm.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.820
By the way, you talk in your sleep.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.202
It's very annoying.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.744
[anchor] After two days
of tense negotiations,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.747
President Kirkman
and former President Moss teamed up--

35:34.883 --> 35:39.218
Hey. I heard you had a hand in finding
East Hun Chiu's installation. Bravo.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.714
Thanks. |, um...
| also found something else.

35:42.849 --> 35:43.714
What?

35:43.850 --> 35:46.558
Two hours before Simon Day
published that story

35:46.686 --> 35:48.848
about payment
for the missile defense system,

35:49.356 --> 35:51.393
he met with President Moss.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.024
Okay. That doesn't mean--

35:54.152 --> 35:55.859
The other reporters who published
the White House scoops,

35:55.987 --> 35:58.228
Tiffany Gimble, Raymond Burns...

35:59.074 --> 36:02.942
The night before they all went to press,
they all met with Moss, too.

36:03.078 --> 36:06.116
[exhales sharply] The former president
is the leak?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.538
Yes.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.246
-[woman] Sir.
-[Cornelius] Thank you.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.251
Tom, I thought
we'd buttoned everything up.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.723
| know it was you who contacted Simon Day.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.966
-I'm sorry?
-You're going to be.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.641
Leaking classified information
during negotiations is a felony.

36:31.773 --> 36:34.936
Uh, hold on just a minute.
Let's be clear here.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.229
President Han called me for advice.

36:37.362 --> 36:41.447
She was unhappy about being forced
to pay for East Hun Chiu's defense system.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.827
[angrily] You chose to help her
by publicizing the deal?!

36:43.952 --> 36:47.536
You knew it would tank the negotiations,
so you could ride in on your white horse.

36:47.664 --> 36:50.656
We just presided over
a landmark peace agreement.

36:50.792 --> 36:54.456
If that article helped get us there,
I'm glad I played my part.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.453
What about all the other leaks, Cornelius?

36:57.215 --> 37:00.333
Icarus Astrotech? My wife's subpoena?
My ethics review?

37:00.468 --> 37:04.462
From the second I named you secretary of state,
you've been quietly trying to undermine me.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.588
You think that's been my intent?

37:06.725 --> 37:09.012
| can only come up with two reasons
for your behavior.

37:09.144 --> 37:13.012
Extreme bitterness or a desperate desire
to become relevant again.

37:13.148 --> 37:17.392
There's a third explanation, Tom,
and it's the right one. Patriotism.

37:17.527 --> 37:21.521
[scoffs] If you believe that,
you're not just simply misguided,

37:21.656 --> 37:23.192
you're completely lost.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.986
Is that what you call being
held to account for your decisions?

37:26.119 --> 37:29.532
None of the yes-men
you surround yourself with do that.

37:30.457 --> 37:34.200
They tell you how great you are,
let you fumble away your mandate.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.293
That's the best shot you got?
Attacking my staff.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.130
I'm saying these are dangerous times.
You need all the help you can get.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.592
But you're not okay getting it,
which is why you fired me.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.132
We both know why I fired you.
You're disloyal.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.007
No, Tom. I'm loyal. To my country.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.640
Which is the highest calling
any public servant ever has.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.686
I'm putting you on notice. The White House
Counsel will be looking into your activities.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.774
If you've done anything illegal,

38:00.695 --> 38:02.652
I'll be handing the matter over
to the Justice Department.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.864
Yeah, you can do what you want.
You're the president.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.323
That's right. I am.

38:07.452 --> 38:11.070
But I will leave you with one last piece
of advice from a subordinate.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.041
If you come for me, come hard.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.873
Because I fight back.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.500
And I know how to win.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.417
Mr. President.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.765
-[knock at door]
-Hey.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.265
Hey. The conquering hero returns.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.604
So, the W60-3.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.600
| shouldn't have looked at it, but I did.
| know, I'm sorry.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.942
That's fine. What did you write?

38:43.071 --> 38:45.028
It's not that I wrote anything.
It's just that...

38:45.657 --> 38:47.773
It's the fact that we're on display.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.240
Wow.

38:50.245 --> 38:54.034
Okay. So, first you don't want to date.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.866
Then you want to break up.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.369
Then you want to go public.
Now you're obsessing over how public?

39:00.505 --> 39:02.291
It's my process.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.835
That's not a process, Em.
That's ambivalence.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.584
| am not ambivalent.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.461
Look, this job forces me
to keep my guard up,

39:09.597 --> 39:13.591
so I'm having a hard time letting it down
and losing control.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.593
A relationship is about losing control
and surrendering.

39:16.729 --> 39:20.563
-Can you surrender, even for a little bit?
-Why do I have to surrender on a form?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.228
It's not about the form. It's about us.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.226
Do you want us?
That's what the form is asking.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.569
-Yes.
-Yes, but on your own terms, right?

39:26.698 --> 39:29.406
-Where you're a cat and I'm a ball of yarn.
-That's not fair.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.071
It's completely fair.
I'm sick of getting batted around.

39:32.203 --> 39:36.071
| don't do things half-way.
And you won't go all the way.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.165
[sighs] So this sounds to me
like a textbook definition

39:39.294 --> 39:40.955
of an irreconcilable difference.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.836
-Seth.
-No, it's okay.

39:43.965 --> 39:48.050
Clarity's a good thing.
Thank you for finally giving that to me.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.769
| enter this deal under great duress.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.141
My country has been coerced
by West Hun Chiu and...

40:03.276 --> 40:05.813
Kim's killing us.
But he signed on the dotted line.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.028
Now the international community must hold him
to the terms.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.649
The treaty's not the problem right now.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.075
The agency just picked this up.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.836
This intel is reliable?

40:28.968 --> 40:31.801
Yes, sir. The chatter started
right after the treaty was signed.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.887
So, somewhere here in the US,
there's a dirty bomb?

40:34.015 --> 40:35.096
Yes, sir.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.761
-And we have no idea where it is?
-No, sir.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.302
Then we damn well better find it.
