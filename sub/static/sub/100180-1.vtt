01:11.439 --> 01:13.639
[man] <i> What do you see</i>
      <i> beyond this wall?</i>

01:15.176 --> 01:16.308
<i> Picture it.</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:18.477
<i> You've got an imagination.</i>
          <i> Go ahead.</i>

01:20.681 --> 01:24.249
What I see is a small town
        in the Midwest.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.452
Handful of churches.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.189
Some places for the farmers
     to get drunk together.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.242
Maybe a salon

01:33.243 --> 01:35.193
for their wives to do their hair
        on the holidays.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.099
I visit these places.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.669
These are the people
    who send us our profits,

01:43.671 --> 01:45.771
who send us your wages.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.508
I make movies, Judy,
       but it's your job

01:49.510 --> 01:50.876
to give those people dreams.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.480
The economy's in the gutter,
    and they pay for you.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.149
And I'll tell you
        something else.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.819
In every one of those towns,
          believe me,

02:01.422 --> 02:04.289
there's a girl
    who's prettier than you.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.259
Maybe their nose is a little
     thinner at the bridge.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.863
They have better teeth than you.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.499
Or they're taller
      or they're slimmer.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.869
Only, you have something

02:16.871 --> 02:19.338
none of those pretty girls
         can ever have.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.573
You know what that is?

02:23.744 --> 02:24.810
No, sir.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.147
[man] You have that voice.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.216
It'll maybe take you to Oz,

02:31.585 --> 02:34.753
someplace none of those pretty
       girls can ever go.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.258
Still, I'm told you're unhappy.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.327
[Judy]
  Well, no, sir, not unhappy.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.697
I'd just maybe like a little
           more time.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.834
Time? For what?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.936
I don't know.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.439
Maybe to go to the pictures
   like those other girls do.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.578
The thing is, those other girls
  will grow up to be cashiers

02:59.813 --> 03:03.448
and farmers' wives
and elementary school teachers.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.952
And they'll see their skins
 roughed up through housework.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.721
Is that what you want, Judy?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.857
To be just a housewife?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.526
To be just a mother?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.596
Out there,

03:17.598 --> 03:19.932
you'd have to put away
      that voice of yours.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.600
Forget it exists.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.337
But here, with us,
       with your family,

03:25.940 --> 03:28.240
that voice will make you
       a million dollars

03:28.242 --> 03:29.541
before you're 20.

03:34.748 --> 03:39.351
Those average kids,
they're all loved, in their way.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.554
I can see how you
      may be drawn to it,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.656
from time to time.
       Their small lives.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.527
Not too dangerous.
       Not too exciting.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.563
They're where they belong.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.000
And maybe you feel like
       you're like them.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.636
But really, you're not.

03:57.972 --> 04:00.906
You live in another world
           entirely.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.809
They just look like you.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.780
But if you truly wanna
         go join them,

04:09.617 --> 04:10.749
it's your decision.

04:10.751 --> 04:15.420
We'll shake hands and you
  can walk through our gates.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.656
I guarantee it's all there,

04:19.692 --> 04:22.744
the rest of America,

04:22.745 --> 04:25.796
just waiting to swallow you up
   and forget all about you.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.535
Like a raindrop
   falling into the Pacific.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.305
Who cares? Who even notices?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.974
Of course I wanna stay
      with the studio, LB.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.543
Any girl would kill
         to be Dorothy.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.912
I'm just terribly sorry if...

04:42.783 --> 04:44.916
I didn't even say anything
           to anyone.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.488
[Mayer]
   You're my favorite, Judy.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.928
-Who else have we had in?
 -Shirley Temple this morning.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.398
Everybody loves Shirley.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.668
Let's see how Judy measures up.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.806
[Judy] Joey, did you grow again?

05:40.808 --> 05:41.873
[Joey] I guess.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.843
Oh! Well, could you at least
       do it all at once?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.679
Just get it over with
          one weekend?

05:47.948 --> 05:51.083
'Cause it's a new pair of pants
  every time you add an inch.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.685
Dad says vitamins
         make me grow.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.587
So, we'll cut those out.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.056
Oh, I'm kidding, darling.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.959
It's a wonderful thing
    to have a son big enough

06:00.961 --> 06:03.028
he can carry his mother
          to the car.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.431
Lorna, sweetheart,
        let me see you.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.966
[Lorna] What are we doing first?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.068
Oh, the usual. Is that okay?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.437
-Yeah.
-You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.539
-[man] So, I have your money.
              -Oh.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.808
[man chuckles]
     Crowd's gonna go crazy

06:16.810 --> 06:18.009
-out there.
              -Aw.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.945
[man] So, it's $150.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.315
Uh, I know it's not maybe

06:23.316 --> 06:24.682
-what you're used to, but--
   -No, no, I appreciate it.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.984
-[man] All right.
             -I do.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.853
-Okay, you ready?
             -Sure.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.988
-Follow me.
            -Go on.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.824
[announcer] <i> All right, folks...</i>

06:32.826 --> 06:35.594
We'll just do what we did
       in New York, yeah?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.829
[announcer] <i> Hope you're ready.</i>
   <i> Put your hands together.</i>

06:37.831 --> 06:39.498
Okay, let's go, let's go.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.899
How are you tonight, Altadena?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.534
[announcer] <i> One of Hollywood's</i>
        <i> true legends,</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.669

06:44.671 --> 06:46.538
[Judy] <i> Well, I've got something</i>
         <i> very special</i>

06:46.540 --> 06:48.940

06:51.178 --> 06:53.111
[muffled cheering]

07:11.198 --> 07:12.564
[groans]

07:13.734 --> 07:15.133
What a journey.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.437
I'm sorry it's so late.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.706
How you doing, Georgie?

07:22.176 --> 07:24.676
I'm okay, thank you,
     Miss Garland. And you?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.912
Oh, stumbling along.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.014
Any messages
   while we were out of town?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.950
Uh, I don't think so.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.820
Okay. Well, could I just
      have my key, please?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.823
Let me check something
 with Mr. Horowitz. One moment.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.560
Can we get room service, Mama?
        I missed dinner.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.162
Sure, sweetheart.
       Anything you want.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.601
-[Horowitz] Miss Garland.
     -Oh, please. I'm Judy.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.971
-Could I have a word?
         -Can it wait?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.040
We're just desperate
         to get to bed.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.942
Lorna, darling,
    tell Peter what you want

07:56.944 --> 07:58.510
and he'll take care of it.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.178
A hamburger and fries, please.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.615
Oh, and, you know,
    I'd love a bowl of soup.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.584
And a drink.
        Vodka rocks.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.119
You know what, forget the soup.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.723
I'm too tired to even
   wield a spoon. [chuckles]

08:12.092 --> 08:14.860
I'm very sorry, but your suite
       has been released.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.496
What do you mean, "released"?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.865
It's not still attached
        to the building?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.833
Where exactly has it gone?
           [chuckles]

08:22.069 --> 08:24.669
I believe your account
        was in arrears.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.240
Oh. No. No, I don't...
 I don't think that's the case.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.775
-The room got released.
       -So un-release it.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.943
Hand it back.
    We need to sleep in it.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.780
-Is everything okay?
       -No. No, darling.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.149
These people have let us
        down very badly

08:38.284 --> 08:41.720
leaving us stranded without so
   much as a change of socks.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.154
Everything is in storage.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.791
I could have rooms
     anywhere in this city,

08:46.793 --> 08:49.027
but I chose this hotel.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.896
Well, not anymore.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.265
I wouldn't let my worst enemy
           stay here.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.166
Let's just go.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.869
Outraged.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.941
Come on, sweetheart.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.322
-Please don't go to sleep now.
          -No, no, no.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.924
These are the other ones.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.865
-Where are we going?
        -The Roosevelt.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.067
[Lorna]
Didn't we stay there last year?

09:29.836 --> 09:32.337
Sure.
       But they like us.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.841
Mama.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.748
Could we head toward Brentwood,
            please?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.189
Joe, get the bell,
      would you, darling?

09:51.592 --> 09:52.691
[bell dings]

10:01.635 --> 10:02.968
So, you wanna stay?

10:03.604 --> 10:04.703
No.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.038
And they're only
        staying tonight.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.741
-So, they have school tomorrow.
         -I know that.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.910
They slept in the cab.
        They'll be fine.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.813
I probably paid more
      on cab fare tonight

10:14.948 --> 10:16.381
than I would've on a hotel.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.118
-What about tomorrow night?
        -What about it?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.688
-Come on. Don't play that game.
-Well, you're needling me, Sid.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.690
-Just ask me a straight question
          -All right,

10:25.692 --> 10:27.859
where are my children
  gonna sleep tomorrow night?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.094
Wherever I tell them.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.096
[floorboards creaking]

10:32.232 --> 10:33.331
[Judy] Hi, sweetheart.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.899
-Something wrong?
          -[Sid] Hey.

10:35.369 --> 10:38.203
-I-- I can't sleep.
      -You want some milk?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.339
-Come here.
   -[Sid] No, you go to bed.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.109
We'll bring it to you, okay?
          Don't worry.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.647
[Judy] Where are the mugs?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.181
I moved them.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.951
They're where the glasses were.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.655
-Ridiculous.
          -[chuckles]

11:01.795 --> 11:03.895
Couldn't you just take a role
         in something?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.430
I'm "unreliable."

11:07.100 --> 11:08.833
And "uninsurable."

11:10.937 --> 11:13.905
That's what the ones who like me
        say to my face.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.441
So, thank you for that.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.910
Leave me out of it.

11:20.080 --> 11:25.150
"Judy, leave it to me
  and you'll be back on top."

11:25.152 --> 11:27.419
-Look how that turned out.
      -"Where is she, Sid?

11:27.421 --> 11:28.853
Is she sick?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.155
-Is she coming in today?"
            -Don't.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.723
-"Where's your star?"
            -Don't.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.725
"You realize we're gonna have
     to sue you both, Sid."

11:33.727 --> 11:34.859
-Don't start.
         -"Why are you

11:34.861 --> 11:36.294
even protecting her, Sid?

11:36.763 --> 11:39.164
-What's going on?"
       -Oh, shut up, Sid!

11:39.166 --> 11:41.299
You can't turn up here
 at one o'clock in the morning

11:41.301 --> 11:43.368
-and expect--
 -I know they should be in bed!

11:43.370 --> 11:44.969
It just doesn't always
         work that way.

11:44.971 --> 11:48.306
And it gets late because nobody
     wants to pay to see me

11:48.308 --> 11:49.841
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.343
And I have to work,
   because they need things.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.080
They need an education, Judy.
 They need ten hours of sleep.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.215
Oh, just to hell with this.
      Just call me a cab.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.117
I want custody
    during the school year.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.989
Over my dead body.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.025
Well, no one would be surprised,
          believe me.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.500
Give me the milk.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.802
Give me the milk!

12:25.245 --> 12:27.445
It's a little late for all that,
        don't you think?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.885
Why don't you see yourself out?

12:34.821 --> 12:36.421
[siren wailing in distance]

12:55.308 --> 12:56.775
Can we go here, please?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.077

12:59.079 --> 13:00.145
Thank you.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.446
<i> ¶ I got to tell you true ¶</i>

13:02.415 --> 13:04.249
<i> ¶ Oh, brother Jack ¶</i>

13:04.384 --> 13:06.417
<i>¶ You goin' with sister Sadie ¶</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:08.820
<i> ¶ When you ought to be home ¶</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.122
<i> ¶ With your old lady... ¶</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:12.857
This house is fabulous.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.194
Look at that. She shows.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.963
What, am I early?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.133
-You look fabulous.
     -[Judy] Liza, darling,

13:22.135 --> 13:23.134
you look beautiful.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.404
I can't believe you came.
    What are you doing here?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.173
Well, I wanted to see you,
            darling.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.108
Are you in L.A. for a while?

13:30.277 --> 13:33.545
Well, I never know, you know,
     these days. [chuckles]

13:33.547 --> 13:35.380
I have a show
      opening in two days.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.016
-You do? Really?
           -Mm. Yeah.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.020
-And how do you feel about it?
         -I don't know.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.355
I know my lines
   and it's all in my range.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.591
I guess I haven't really
  thought about it that much.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.028
You're not even
   a little anxious about it?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.397
-Well, should I be anxious?
            -Well...

13:54.234 --> 13:56.568
I mean, no.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.603
-No.
        -[Liza chuckles]

14:00.207 --> 14:03.308
Um, we were off to go dance.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.009
Will you come with us?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.544
No, no.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.347
No, you go.
     I'll catch up to you.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.317
[indistinct chatter]

14:21.895 --> 14:23.394
[cheering]

14:27.500 --> 14:29.067
Excuse me. This is for you.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.504
We can't have the world's
      greatest entertainer

14:33.506 --> 14:35.106
out here without a drink.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.110
-Frank Sinatra's here?
        -[Mickey laughs]

14:40.013 --> 14:42.547
Frank is great,
   but he is no Judy Garland.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.349
I bet it kills him.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.317
[laughing]

14:50.156 --> 14:52.056
-I'm Mickey, by the way.
             -Judy.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.196
So, you live in Los Angeles,
            Mickey?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.232
Mm. No, I manage a bar
       back in New York.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.568
I'm out here looking
   at a business opportunity.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.069
[Judy] Hmm.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.138
You ever make your own
           cocktails?

15:07.340 --> 15:10.141
-Hmm.
-This place, we sell the booze,

15:10.143 --> 15:12.577
and all the mixings and stuff
       is on the tables,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.646
so you get to invent
     something of your own.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.214
You know, it's fun.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.049
People drink more
   'cause they wanna be part

15:18.051 --> 15:19.550
of the next new thing,
           you know.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.019
-Oh?
         -I don't know.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.354
You have to have ambitions,
             right?

15:23.490 --> 15:25.590
Well, I used to have them.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.626
I found they gave me
  the most terrible headache.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.627
Well...

15:29.629 --> 15:32.330
if you wanna create
   the Judy Garland martini,

15:32.599 --> 15:33.665
that's me.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.567
-Mr. Mickey Deans.
             -Yep.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.202
Hmm.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.471
You have kids, Mickey?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.608
Uh, no. No, I don't.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.310
Hmm. Well, you shouldn't.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.513
It's like living with your heart
  on the outside of your body.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.981
[chuckles]

15:49.983 --> 15:54.652
Find a hobby or something,
 like canasta or birdwatching.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.721
Well, I play piano, actually.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.289
-Oh, you do?
             -Yeah.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.025
You play anything
       or you just sing?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.394
Just sing?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.730
[laughing] Sorry.
      That's not what I...

16:06.099 --> 16:08.433
-Did that come out wrong?
      -My entire childhood

16:08.435 --> 16:10.401
I must've slept five
          hours total.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.204
It's a wonder
   I learned to use cutlery,

16:13.206 --> 16:15.239
let alone play the violin.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.147
We've changed our minds. We're
  gonna head to Andy's place.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.315
Will you come?

16:25.185 --> 16:28.252
I don't know.
     I think I might stay.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.321
Well, you don't know
          anyone here.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.757
Well, everybody
       seems to know me.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.192
[Mickey chuckles]

16:34.194 --> 16:37.395
Besides, I wanna stay somewhere
 for longer than five minutes.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.063
You go. Have fun.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.232
-Mom?
           -I'm fine.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.734
Go.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.669
I love you.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.074
-I love you.
          -I love you.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.663
<i> -Voilà.</i>
       -The masterpiece.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.765
[chuckles]

17:16.770 --> 17:18.435
[whispering]
        Well, what now?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.051
[whispering]
           You can't!

17:41.694 --> 17:42.693
[Judy laughs]

17:44.464 --> 17:45.530
[laughs]

17:53.573 --> 17:56.374
-Wanna hear something?
     -[piano music starts]

17:56.543 --> 17:57.675
Yeah, sure.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.512
I've nowhere else to be.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.483
All right. If you don't like it,

18:05.485 --> 18:07.552
just toss a drink at me
      or something, okay?

18:07.554 --> 18:10.154
-I'll get the message.
     -I will, don't worry.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.857
Do you wanna join me?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.693
Hell, no.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.262
I'm the audience.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.777
It's very good.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.583
[laughs]

18:38.585 --> 18:43.387
[exhales] This has been
       a good time, huh?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.326
Well, we're not done yet,
            are we?

18:51.464 --> 18:52.630
I hope not.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.569
If you ever wanna get together,
   just... click your heels.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.671
That's how it works, right?

19:05.912 --> 19:07.545
[man] You gotta at least
           eat some.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.282
[chuckles]
         I don't know.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.384
[soft ballad playing]

19:30.436 --> 19:31.569
Oh!

19:33.706 --> 19:35.540
Those are too good.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.844
You're gonna have to,
         I don't know,

19:40.213 --> 19:42.446
tie my hands to the chair legs.
        Only then

19:42.448 --> 19:44.615
I'd probably lean forward
  and grab 'em with my mouth.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.653
Hey, I'm eating those.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.855
You wanna see if I can manage
       a whole hamburger?

19:51.457 --> 19:52.924
[muffled camera clicking]

19:54.194 --> 19:55.426
Mickey?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.262
Are we dating?

20:01.568 --> 20:04.235
I just wanna know
so as I know how to look at you.

20:06.940 --> 20:07.972
So...

20:07.974 --> 20:11.742
I think we're just pals
  who might be something more

20:11.744 --> 20:13.377
sometime in the future.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.647
You gotta ask Mr. Mayer.
    I think it's just pals.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.484
I'm not kissing you
  if that's what you're after.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.289
Your loss.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.458
-Don't I know it.
         -And anyways,

20:27.727 --> 20:29.560
after a mouthful
        of onion rings?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.562
-No, thanks!
        -[Mickey laughs]

20:35.735 --> 20:37.585
[publicist] No hamburger.

20:37.586 --> 20:39.436
Mr. Mayer said very specifically
 you were not to eat the food.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.473
I'm honestly very hungry.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.978
Those'll take the edge off.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.347
No, I gotta sleep tonight.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.351
Halpert will give you something
for that later. Down the hatch.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.890
-[door opens]
 -[man] Okay, boys, here we go.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.693
-[publicist] ...get set up.
 -Let her at least take a bite.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.028
[publicist]
    We can't have a Dorothy

21:04.030 --> 21:05.896
who puts on weight
  halfway through the picture.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.965
-His words, not mine.
-[man] Can you take another bite

21:07.967 --> 21:09.700
with your head to the side,
          Mr. Rooney?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.736
[indistinct chatter]

21:12.505 --> 21:15.039
-[man 1] Yeah. That's our shot!
  -[man 2] That's great stuff.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.441
-[cameras clicking]
  -[man 3] That's great, Judy!

21:25.318 --> 21:26.917
[man] Okay. Right.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.954
-Okay.
   -[hangs up phone receiver]

21:31.891 --> 21:33.791
So, that was Sid's lawyers
         on the phone.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.593
-Why?
      -[man] He wants them

21:35.728 --> 21:38.996
Sunday through Friday
      during school time.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.766
-No.
  -He claims you're homeless.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.969
How's he even
      paying for a lawyer?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.371
He's not making money
        off me anymore.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.440
So, where are you staying?

21:50.043 --> 21:52.443
I love my children.
      I take care of them.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.445
Where'd you stay last night?

21:54.447 --> 21:55.746
With a friend.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.849
And is that somewhere maybe
you could take the kids to stay?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.551
I don't have a home.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.021
I can't even get a manager.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.625
Step right up
   and take 10% of my debts.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.927
You know what I'm gonna say.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.364
-[Judy groans]
    -London would offer you

22:13.366 --> 22:14.832
-a lot of money
              -No.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.767
See, they're crazy for you.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.936
It's because the English
          are insane.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.705
Look, start earning again.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.973
Then Sid's people
   will have nothing on you.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.509
Lorna does adore London.

22:26.713 --> 22:27.845
Honey...

22:27.847 --> 22:31.048
the courts won't let you
 take them out of the country.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.652
So, you're saying
  I have to leave my children

22:34.654 --> 22:37.688
if I wanna make enough money
    to be with my children?

22:37.690 --> 22:38.889
I know it's hard.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.593
But I think you have
    to take this seriously.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.697
I can't.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.010
Thank you.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.389
Oh, God.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.828
[Joe] You'll miss Christmas.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.799
Well, you see, darling,
     the problem is that...

23:22.001 --> 23:24.402
I don't currently own a chimney

23:24.737 --> 23:28.072
for Santa to climb down,
  so I'm no good to you kids.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.642
But I'll be back
     for New Year's, okay?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.180
Joey.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.084
Joe.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.985
Darling, I have to fix things,
             okay,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.855
so I can see you every day,
    the whole of every day.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.959
I just need a little money
      to make that happen.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.694
Where would we live then?

23:51.164 --> 23:53.831
I'm going to find us a new home
      for the three of us,

23:53.833 --> 23:55.566
so don't you get
     too comfortable here.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.735
I'm coming straight back
            for you.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.604
I am.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.942
Or maybe...

24:07.213 --> 24:08.846
I could...

24:10.082 --> 24:13.517
just hide out in here...

24:14.587 --> 24:17.688
with Nibbles instead.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.890
[gasps]

24:23.029 --> 24:24.094
Okay.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.967
[door opens]

24:31.637 --> 24:32.803
Shh.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.050
Ooh, it's very spacious in here.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.187
I might just have a bathroom
          plumbed in.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.224
You wouldn't mind,
        would you, Joe?

24:53.559 --> 24:54.792
[Joe] <i> I'd love it.</i>

24:56.529 --> 24:59.563
Well, maybe I'll stay put, hmm?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.933
Would you visit me
        once in a while?

25:03.169 --> 25:04.802
In Joey's wardrobe?

25:06.572 --> 25:08.038
Oh, sure.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.041
-There's room for three.
       -[Lorna chuckles]

25:12.245 --> 25:14.211
-[footsteps]
         -[door opens]

25:15.982 --> 25:17.515
Well, come on in.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.520
Do you wanna... Do you guys
wanna play tennis or something?

25:22.522 --> 25:23.754
There's a court over there.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.290
Aw.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.894
I do like it here.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.268
I would very much like to stay.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.941
-[photographers shouting] Judy!

-I love you.
   -I love you too, darling.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.721
-Welcome to the Picador.
    -Thank you very much.

25:59.859 --> 26:00.925
Thank you.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.061
-Hello.
    -Welcome, Miss Garland.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.329
Oh, thank you.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.933
-[Bernard] Ah, there she is.
        -[Judy chuckles]

26:09.335 --> 26:12.069
-The fabulous Miss Judy Garland.
              -Oh.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.838
-Bernard Delfont. How are you?
   -How wonderful. I'm good.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.840
I just adore London,

26:16.842 --> 26:19.343
-my home away from home.
 -[Bernard chuckles] Marvelous.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.811
-Come with me.
          -Thank you.

26:20.813 --> 26:21.879
-Hello.
            -Hello.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.931
I'm Rosalyn Wilder.
   I'll be looking after you

26:23.932 --> 26:25.982
-while you're in London.
          -Wonderful.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.985
Oh, lovely.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.354
We have a schedule
        printed for you.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.757
How old are you?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.827
I'm-- I'm 28.

26:37.964 --> 26:41.332
Oh, it is a little cold in here.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.635
[Rosalyn]
    Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.371
I'll have somebody
   look into that right away.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.273
Thank you.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.710
Everywhere else I go,

26:52.712 --> 26:54.812
it seems they just
      knock the place down

26:54.814 --> 26:57.014
and start over as soon
          as I leave.

26:57.650 --> 27:01.318
I come back the next year
 and I have no idea where I am.

27:01.887 --> 27:06.090
London just sort of slaps on
    another coat of paint.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.726
I suppose we're rather
         old-fashioned.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.628
Oh, no, I like it.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.663
I like it.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.798
It's comforting.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.100
Call me if you need anything.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.168
I'll leave my card
   for you on the table here.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.837
It's beside the schedule.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.407
Hadn't forgotten the...
   [British accent] schedule.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.176
I-- I really do appreciate it.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.912
-We'll see you tomorrow morning.
       -See you tomorrow.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.715
[door closes]

28:07.353 --> 28:09.820
[Rosalyn] Thank you.
      Right, here we are.

28:10.823 --> 28:11.922
[Judy] Here?

28:12.224 --> 28:13.924
-Really?
    -[Rosalyn] Mm-hmm.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.960
We do all our rehearsals here.
   The acoustic is wonderful.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.262

[Judy]
  Well, that sounds familiar.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.907
[chuckles] Judy,
    this is our band leader,

28:29.909 --> 28:31.742
Burt Rhodes. Burt, Judy.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.327
-It's...
      -[Judy] Hello, Burt.

28:33.328 --> 28:34.911
...an honor to be working
     with you, Ms. Garland.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.280
I've been an admirer
        for a long time.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.048
Well, I like this one.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.850
He can stay.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.486
The whole town
     is talking about you.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.089
Oh, well,
    let's not dwell on that.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.124
Oh, no.
   It's completely sold out.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.392
[Burt] Hmm!

28:50.763 --> 28:51.995
[Judy chuckles]

29:00.973 --> 29:02.206
Miss Garland?

29:03.275 --> 29:05.476
Do you need anything
     or should we dive in?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.278
You know,
   it's really damp in here.

29:08.881 --> 29:11.849
I don't think rehearsing
        is a good idea.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.853
Right.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.122
-Uh...
   -You understand, darling?

29:19.024 --> 29:21.959
Okay, well, how about we talk
   about the band positions?

29:23.796 --> 29:24.862
Okay.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.498
Well, I'm going to be here.

29:27.833 --> 29:31.502
And this, this is the mark-up
         for the stage.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.772
Hmm.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.177
Right.
   And where's the audience?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.913
Wrapped around you,
        all three sides.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.216
Mm-hmm.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.416
-And they're on one level?
        -[Rosalyn] Four.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.494
How many tiers
       was Carnegie Hall?

29:59.098 --> 30:00.330
[Judy] Five.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.106
[piano playing]

30:09.108 --> 30:11.475
We can discuss the songs
     if you really want to.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.011
[Burt] I have all your charts.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.412
Any changes
    you might like to make?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.980
No, everything the same.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.949
[Burt] Is there anything
       to discuss, then?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.851
Sweetheart, that's up to you.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.154
I don't particularly need
      to discuss anything.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.024
[Rosalyn]
  Judy, I'm afraid the critics

30:27.026 --> 30:29.860
-will review opening night.
             -Sure.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.196
Of course.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.433
-It's tomorrow.
       -I'd like to rest.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.840

30:43.108 --> 30:44.474
Are the kids there?

30:45.477 --> 30:47.144
Will you tell them
         that I called?

30:47.146 --> 30:51.481
And that I'll try them again
     at this time tomorrow?

30:52.151 --> 30:54.518

      <i> to be on the line</i>

It's 3:00 in the morning, ma'am.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.473
-Oh.
 -[man] Can I get you anything?

31:51.477 --> 31:54.511
I am having a little trouble
           sleeping.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.214
Some warm milk, perhaps?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.350
Sure.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.288
Thank you.
    I'll try anything once.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.323

    up to you straightaway.

  I like it to stay that way.

Yeah, if you like.

Judy, we're locking up.

43:26.871 --> 43:28.371
Hmm. Okay.

43:31.843 --> 43:34.344
There's absolutely no rush.
        Take your time.

43:37.882 --> 43:40.817
Can I, uh, get you anything?

43:41.219 --> 43:42.852
No. No, no.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.396
I thought you were very good.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.704
What if I can't do it again?

44:03.074 --> 44:04.140
[chuckles]

44:13.685 --> 44:15.352
Oh.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.020
-A mess.
 -Here. Let me have a go at it.

44:18.723 --> 44:21.958
-[chuckles]
            -There.

44:28.199 --> 44:31.434
-Perfect. [laughs]
     -Brand new. [chuckles]

44:33.705 --> 44:36.205
Right. Well,
    can I get you anything?

44:36.374 --> 44:37.840
No. No, thanks.

44:39.411 --> 44:40.977
A glass of water or...

44:41.279 --> 44:46.215
No, no. I'll get my bag
   and I'll meet you outside.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.217
Of course.

44:55.927 --> 44:56.993
[door closes]

45:47.112 --> 45:48.911
[footsteps approaching]

45:52.183 --> 45:53.249
Get up.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.857
I can't sleep at all anymore.

46:00.992 --> 46:04.360
Please, I can't sleep.
        Please. Please.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.529
That's not my department.

46:08.066 --> 46:09.766
But I can't remember the steps,

46:10.135 --> 46:12.435
and the others
  keep pushing me to the back,

46:12.437 --> 46:15.138
and everyone shouts at me
when I have a hard time with it.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.240
[publicist] Get up.

46:19.878 --> 46:23.079
-What's this?
    -Judy Garland turns 16.

46:24.516 --> 46:27.784
-But that's not for two months.
  -[publicist] Gotta be today.

46:28.353 --> 46:30.086
Scheduling issues.

46:30.555 --> 46:33.089
Nobody splash her hair.

46:34.425 --> 46:37.927
So this is really--
I mean, it's not really a party?

46:38.163 --> 46:40.830
In the middle of a shoot?
 You would have to be kidding.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.932
There is a cake. Don't eat it.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.101
Is it fake?

46:45.103 --> 46:46.536
[publicist] Pretend to eat it.

46:47.472 --> 46:49.205
You know I get an hour
           for lunch?

46:49.440 --> 46:52.141
-It's in my contract.
  -What are you talking about?

46:52.510 --> 46:56.879
I get an hour. I wanna have it.
  I don't see why I shouldn't.

46:56.881 --> 46:58.581
[publicist]
   Nobody takes it. Come on.

47:01.986 --> 47:02.985

47:05.290 --> 47:07.924
Don't you dare.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.114

[audience] Yeah!

47:33.218 --> 47:34.851
What do you have in mind?

47:36.154 --> 47:38.087
Is he propositioning me?

47:38.456 --> 47:39.889
[laughter]

47:40.291 --> 47:42.225

      "The Trolley Song"?

49:34.439 --> 49:36.539
Is there anyone
       at the stage door?

49:36.741 --> 49:38.307
I'll go and check.

49:40.378 --> 49:43.179
That's okay. I'll just go.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.193
We could have a drink
          if you like.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.129
I'll see you tomorrow.

50:04.302 --> 50:06.769
Well, your television
   interview's all confirmed.

50:07.238 --> 50:08.704
It's a prime slot, so...

50:09.474 --> 50:11.741
Oh, marvelous. Thank you.

50:14.278 --> 50:16.512
-Well, good night.
          -Good night.

50:23.321 --> 50:24.437
Good night, Norman.

[Norman]
   Good night, Miss Garland.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.256

-[Judy] Aw! Evening, fellas.
            -Bravo.

50:30.094 --> 50:33.029
-You were wonderful again.
  -[Judy] Thank you, darling.

50:33.364 --> 50:36.232
-Would you mind?
        -Oh, of course.

50:39.337 --> 50:42.638
Coming to see you every night
   next week. You're just...

50:43.341 --> 50:45.307
I, um... What was it
      that I said earlier?

50:46.310 --> 50:48.444
-About Judy?
       -Yes, about Judy.

50:48.446 --> 50:50.212
-Of course about Judy.
       -Uh, it was about

50:50.214 --> 50:53.616
how you seem to bypass the ears
         and land here.

50:53.618 --> 50:56.352
-That was the gist of it.
          -Thank you.

50:59.157 --> 51:00.322
Um...

51:02.727 --> 51:04.794
Uh, do you...

51:06.664 --> 51:07.830
Do you wanna, um...

51:10.134 --> 51:13.836
get some dinner or-- I mean,
 if you're not doing anything.

51:17.608 --> 51:20.776
-You mean with us?
     -I don't wanna impose.

51:21.112 --> 51:25.481
-No. Yes. I mean--
-I mean, that would be beyond...

51:26.651 --> 51:30.719
-Where's gonna be open?
-On a Tuesday after midnight...

51:31.189 --> 51:33.556
-If it's trouble, I don't--
        -No, no, no. No.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.459
-We'll find somewhere, won't we?
          -Of course.

51:36.461 --> 51:38.360
[Judy] Great, okay, well...

51:45.670 --> 51:46.702
Oh!

51:47.138 --> 51:49.405
I thought they'd be open.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.540
Perhaps it was terrible
          dragging you

51:51.542 --> 51:54.243
-through the streets like this.
        -Oh, no, don't.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.812
I haven't had a chance
    to see any of the city.

51:57.181 --> 52:00.182
And, well,
 now I've seen all of it, so...

52:00.785 --> 52:01.851
Sweet.

52:03.821 --> 52:06.255
Would you like me
     to make you an omelet?

52:07.458 --> 52:09.492
Obviously, we'll try
 for something a little better

52:09.494 --> 52:10.593
than an omelet.

52:11.195 --> 52:12.795
We're just round the corner.

52:14.398 --> 52:15.498
You won't believe it,

52:15.633 --> 52:17.566
but it was twice
      with Mickey Rooney.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.268
[laughing]

52:19.504 --> 52:21.670
[man] You are outrageous.
        You all right

52:21.672 --> 52:23.305
-with the green plates?
         -Yes, please.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.640
-Great.
         -I like those.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.308
-Me too.
            -Mm.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.210
I think I messed this up.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.248
You can't really mess up
           an omelet.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.383
I put cream in it.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.785
-Why would you put cream in?
   -To make it more special.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.255
And instead you've simply
       made it not work.

52:39.257 --> 52:40.556
Yes, I'm aware of that.

52:40.558 --> 52:42.591
If it won't settle
      for being an omelet,

52:42.593 --> 52:45.561
just give it a shove,
 and we'll have scrambled eggs.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.663
-Would you mind?
      -For goodness' sake,

52:47.665 --> 52:50.299
has there ever been so much
 drama over half a dozen eggs?

52:50.601 --> 52:53.669
[laughs]

52:53.671 --> 52:55.504
I mean, we invite you
        over for dinner,

52:55.506 --> 52:56.805
all we offer you are eggs,

52:56.807 --> 52:58.541
and now you're doing
          the cooking.

52:58.776 --> 53:00.309
I always do the cooking.

53:01.946 --> 53:03.913
No, I can't. I can't bear it.
            Come on.

53:03.915 --> 53:06.582
-I'm a very good cook.
-I'm sure. Put that spoon down.

53:06.584 --> 53:08.250
-You don't trust me.
       -[laughing] I do.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.786
Put that spoon down,
           would you?

53:10.788 --> 53:14.190
Please, for me. Put the spoon...
Let's give you a drink. Come on.

53:14.192 --> 53:15.858
I'm always going to use cream
          from now on.

53:15.860 --> 53:18.427
It'll be fine.
Let's get you a drink. Come on.

53:18.429 --> 53:19.895
You sit yourself down.

53:21.399 --> 53:23.933
Are you gonna come through
  or hide in there all night?

53:24.869 --> 53:27.703
I'm not sure
 that was even scrambled eggs.

53:28.339 --> 53:31.473
Well, we know some eggs
       went into the pan.

53:31.475 --> 53:33.576
-We witnessed that.
            -Mm-hmm.

53:41.652 --> 53:43.285
It was delicious.

53:44.755 --> 53:47.556
-Whatever it was.
          -[laughing]

53:50.328 --> 53:51.360
Shh.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.908
It's sweet
    that you come to see me.

54:08.746 --> 54:11.614
Sometimes I spy the two
       of you out there.

54:13.718 --> 54:15.884
I feel like I have allies.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.559
Well, we missed you
         in '64, so...

54:25.029 --> 54:27.963
-You couldn't get tickets?
       -Not together, no.

54:31.302 --> 54:35.304
Stan was otherwise engaged.

54:39.477 --> 54:41.510
Six months for obscenity.

54:42.546 --> 54:43.612
In jail?

54:46.717 --> 54:48.717
They've changed the law
          since then.

54:48.886 --> 54:51.553
Turns out we didn't do
   anything wrong after all.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.824
They hound people in this world.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.427
Anybody who's different.

54:58.963 --> 55:00.896
They can't stand it.

55:02.767 --> 55:04.400
Well, to hell with them.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.875
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

55:13.678 --> 55:16.745
We decided to make up for it
      in style this time,

55:16.747 --> 55:19.348
and it is money well spent.

[piano stops]

57:20.838 --> 57:22.438
[knocking on door]

57:24.442 --> 57:25.774
[Judy] No, thank you.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.511
[knocking continues]

57:30.881 --> 57:32.548
No, thank you.

57:32.817 --> 57:34.650

57:40.458 --> 57:41.690
[groans]

57:43.727 --> 57:44.793
[banging on door]

57:45.563 --> 57:47.329
What?

57:47.330 --> 57:49.096
-Room service.
   -I didn't order anything.

57:49.099 --> 57:51.633
It's the first sleep
     I've gotten in weeks!

57:51.635 --> 57:53.135
And you woke me up.

57:54.071 --> 57:56.472
There's a man under the trolley.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.073
What?

57:58.075 --> 57:59.641
-[Mickey] Hey, baby.
         -[clattering]

58:00.845 --> 58:02.778
-Surprise.
            -[gasps]

58:03.848 --> 58:05.047
Mickey?

58:05.549 --> 58:07.649
[laughing]

58:09.220 --> 58:12.554
What are you doing here?
      I can't believe it.

58:17.828 --> 58:20.596
What a wonderful surprise.

58:20.598 --> 58:21.930
-[huffs]
              -Oh!

58:23.267 --> 58:26.134
Oh. [chuckles] Well...

58:27.538 --> 58:30.806
-this is me.
  -Yeah, it's nice, it's nice.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.709
-[Judy] When did you get here?
           -Just now.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.210
-Yeah?
          -Literally.

58:35.212 --> 58:36.812
I just walked off the plane.

58:36.814 --> 58:38.881
-I'm just passing through.
    -Where are you staying?

58:40.184 --> 58:42.618
I don't know. I don't know.
  I literally just showed up.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.019
I haven't thought
        about anything.

58:44.889 --> 58:46.121
Well, stay here.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.123
Yeah?

58:49.527 --> 58:51.760
-I'm drowning in space.
       -[Mickey chuckles]

58:52.930 --> 58:55.864
Yeah, no, I mean, that...
       That sounds great.

58:57.768 --> 59:00.836
Okay. I'll stay here, then.
           [chuckles]

59:03.941 --> 59:06.141
It's so good to see you again.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.979
[Mickey]
   You ever tried a crumpet?

59:11.715 --> 59:13.815
-[Judy] Mm.
 -[groans] It's like a pancake

59:13.817 --> 59:15.717
that's had the living shit
       kicked out of it.

59:15.986 --> 59:17.920
-[Judy laughs]
   -You gonna eat something?

59:19.924 --> 59:22.190
No, no. No, I'm fine.

59:22.192 --> 59:24.726
[Mickey] Well, have some eggs.
 The tomatoes are pretty good.

59:24.728 --> 59:25.794
I'm fine.

59:25.930 --> 59:27.262
Come on, have a bite.

59:28.299 --> 59:29.698
What do you wanna do?

59:29.700 --> 59:30.766
I'm easy.

59:31.769 --> 59:33.902
Maybe, uh... get a drink

59:33.904 --> 59:35.270
-with your friends.
            -Sure.

59:35.706 --> 59:37.573
We could get the gang together.

59:39.009 --> 59:40.676
I'll make some calls.

59:46.016 --> 59:47.049
Yeah, it's okay.

59:48.719 --> 59:49.885
It's just okay?

59:50.888 --> 59:52.220
It's a little old-ladyish.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.697
[chuckles]
        I'm just saying.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.199
You got great legs.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.101
Show them off.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.202
Yeah?

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:08.904
Yeah.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:11.974
Wow.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:15.611
Wish there was a little more
      of them. [chuckles]

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.679
So, let's go shopping, baby.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:19.915
Hmm?

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.818
-Get you dolled up.
         -I don't know.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:26.855
Oh, come on.
A woman's gotta wear something.

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:30.058
-Or not, right?
          -[laughing]

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:32.761
Look out.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:33.828
Don't kill America's sweetheart
             here.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:37.165
All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.668
Oh, yeah, I have a great idea
        for a new shop.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.936
[Judy] Oh? What's that?

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:50.078
It's great to meet you guys.
 I've heard so much about you.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.364
How are you enjoying London,
            Mickey?

01:00:52.365 --> 01:00:54.649
It's one of the world's great
cities, you know, it really is.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:57.219
And there's a lot of
    opportunities here, too.

01:00:57.655 --> 01:01:00.856
Like with The Beatles
  new record. You've heard it?

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:04.026
It's good.
 It's very, very experimental.

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.862
And it's still number one
    on the charts, you know?

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:10.365
That tells me that
there is an appetite out there.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:12.668
For The Beatles?

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:16.138
Well, for great artists
       trying new things.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.440
Like, I don't know you, Burt.
    Judy says you're great.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.242
These are just new ideas,
           you know.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.377
But what if it's not
         Judy and Burt?

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:25.947
What if it's-- What if it's Judy
    and The Rolling Stones?

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.016
-What is that?
           -[laughs]

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.185
I don't know.
  Maybe it's something, right?

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.187
Are you going to ask them
          or should I?

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.125
Maybe somebody should.
 That's all I'm saying for now.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.429
That's the most
    fascinating conjecture.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:41.930
-Thank you.
       -Don't you think?

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:43.065
Oh, absolutely.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:45.767
Ha!

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.003
All right, yeah, cool.
         Another round?

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.838
-[Burt] Yeah, great.
            -Great.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.774
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:00.482
You don't think I could do it.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:02.984
Well, I just...

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.987
Well, I'm trying
      to take the idea in.

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:08.757
Well, he thinks I could do it.

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:12.728
Isn't that sweet?

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:16.498
[Mickey] Judy, what you having?

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.901
-Gin and tonic?
     -[Judy] Yes. [laughs]

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:23.038
The studio portrayed you

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.175
as the sort of typical
American teenage girl next door.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:28.944
Is that how you remember things?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:31.346
Louis B. Mayer. [laughs]

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:35.917
Oh, MGM put out all these
 stories about how I ate pizza

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.452
like any other girl.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.422
They didn't let me have
       any pizza at all.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.491
Every lunchtime for a year,

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:46.027
they had me eating
 Louis B. Mayer's chicken soup

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.430
till I was thin enough
        to play Dorothy.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:50.165
[audience laughs]

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:56.004
[interviewer] The truth is,
  those years left their mark,

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.006
-though, isn't it?
       -[Judy] Oh, sure.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:02.277
Hollywood's chicken population
        never recovered.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:03.512
[laughter]

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:04.946
[interviewer] Very good.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.450
But your childhood
         at the studio,

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.953
it did lead to problems,
           didn't it?

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:16.925
Well, what matters to me now
  is my children's happiness,

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.160
that's all.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.427
Are they here with you
           in London?

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.649
They have school.

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:24.800
[interviewer] Well,
  they must miss their mother.

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:28.203
Hopefully they're having an
easier time of it than you had.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:29.805
Well, we all...

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:33.909
Everybody has their troubles,
       and I've had mine.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:37.445
I've probably had everybody
          else's too.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:41.550
[interviewer] Has it affected
your children, do you think?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.985
What?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.353
The fights over custody.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.355
Your children
     living away from you.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.992
I mean, if I'm this terrible
mother they like to write about,

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:54.563
well, you tell me how I end up
   with such incredible kids.

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:56.898
But I wasn't suggesting--

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.235
Well, no,
   everybody suggests things,

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:05.006
like I'm not a real person,
   but I am, you understand?

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.609
I'm only Judy Garland
      for an hour a night.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.979
The rest of the time,
    I'm part of a family.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.415
I just want
     what everybody wants.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.484
I seem to have a harder time
          getting it.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.855
[interviewer]
  I didn't mean to upset you.

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:21.489
Thank you.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:24.559
[Rosalyn] Have you seen Judy?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.633
Gill, you haven't seen Judy,

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:32.934
-have you?
        -No, I'm sorry.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:35.153
-Judy?
 -[man over P.A.] <i> Miss Garland</i>

01:04:35.154 --> 01:04:37.371
<i> to the stage, please.</i>
        <i> Miss Garland.</i>

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.506
[Rosalyn sighs]

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:47.482
-[door opens, closes]
  -Judy, it's twelve o'clock.

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:50.519
And?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.453
And there's a thousand
        people upstairs

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:54.556
-waiting to hear you sing.
  -So bring 'em another drink.

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.558
And have 'em bring me one, too.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:58.894
I know...

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:03.531
-I know it's not easy.
      -Oh, you do, do you?

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:05.333
I mean, the shows

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.402
-have been a huge success.
           -So what?

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:12.540
It doesn't change anything.
 What difference does it make?

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:13.608
[Rosalyn] Look.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.678
I'll do all I can to help you
  resolve whatever's going on.

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:22.617
But, please... for my sake,
just-- Just-- Just do the show.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.654
You're a classy little number,
          aren't you?

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:28.623
Just get up and sing!

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:32.360
You wanna serve me up to them
 like I'm their goddamn dinner.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.429
Judy, I'm sorry, but that is not
     what I'm trying to do.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.331
-I'm trying to help you.
        -Don't Judy me.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:38.366
You're not my friend.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:43.204
You don't care about me.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.243
[scoffs] Listen, it's fine.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:50.378
It's fine. We'll just
  have Lonnie Donegan perform.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.013
Over my dead body!

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:54.616
-If you don't want to do it--
         -It's my show.

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.618
It's my name up there.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.221
No, Lonnie Donegan
      is a peach of a man,

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:04.960
but he can go fuck himself if he
 thinks he's having my billing.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:08.730
-She's upset.
     -Yes, I gathered that.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.166
[music playing]

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:13.234
Evening, Lonnie.

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.604
[instrumental intro plays]

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.174
No! No time for that, Burt.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:23.011
We've got a show to,
       you know, put on.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.513
-[man] You're late.
           -So what?

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:28.350
It's a party.
         Where are you?

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:31.319
Oh! What, do you have to be home

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.188
for your mommy
       to put you to bed?

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.723
Be a man,
      have another drink.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:36.624
-[laughter]
        -Have one on me.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:38.460
He's gonna have one on me.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.694
[scattered applause]

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.430
-What you let her on stage for?
 -[Judy] Wonderful to be here.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:43.631
There you go.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.367
Yeah.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:50.605
Is this... Is this Chicago?
          What is it?

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.474
The set list says San Francisco.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.342
[booing]

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:56.244
Chicago, San Francisco...

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.646
What the hell town
       are we in anyway?

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.281
[laughter]

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:01.683
[man] Sing us a song.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.120
Is that you again? I thought you
    were gonna have a drink.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:06.755
[man] You drank the bar dry.

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:08.423
-[laughter]
          -[woman] Oh!

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.463
Why did you just
     spoil it for everyone?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.035
How am I supposed to do this
 up here with you harassing me

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:21.536
like that down there?
         Why don't you

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.405
come up here
      and you do the show?

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:26.374
And I'll take the chair
  and do the fatuous backtalk,

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.810
you goddamn fucking baboon!

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.178
[microphone static]

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.819
[booing and whistling]

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:44.125
[publicist] I want her changed
   and ready in five minutes.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:48.129
I'd like a moment with Judy.

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.418
[Mayer sighs]

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.122
[Judy] I had a swim.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.256
[Mayer] How was the water?

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:19.560
Cold.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.796
[Mayer]
  That's because it's a prop.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.099
It's not meant to be enjoyed.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.836
I did 18 hours yesterday.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:31.238
I mean, I couldn't hardly
     remember my own name.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.109
Your name is Frances Gumm.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.313
You're a fat-ankled,
       snag-toothed rube

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.115
from Grand Rapids.
   Your father was a faggot,

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:42.417
and your mother only cares
   about what I think of you.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.587
Now, do you remember
       who you are, Judy?

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.292
I'm sorry if I slowed things
         down a little.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.727
[Mayer] We like you loyal.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.698
You're the best friend.
      The girl next door.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.801
-You're faithful.
          -I'm sorry.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.337
[Mayer]
 You sing from the heart, Judy.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.740
You know where the heart is?

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.212
It's there.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.551
Now, I want you
     to look me in the eye

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:19.787
and tell me you remember
        we made a deal.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.291
I know I did.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.460
You made that choice.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.496
I was there.
      I heard you make it.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.868
I'm sorry.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.639
You wanna go swimming,
you come over to my beach house.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.307
You can swim there all night.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:46.848
Now, say thank you.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.318
Thank you.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.323
Don't ever hold up
        a movie of mine.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.203
[Mickey muffled]
         You know what?

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:10.872
You need your own place.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.242
A club or something.
          Someplace...

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:17.712
people are gonna come to anyway
   because it's a cool place.

01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:22.250
And if you sing, it's a goddamn
  perfect miracle of a night.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:25.520
And if you don't, it's no foul,
      it was a good time.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.756
People just wanna be around you.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.858
You have that.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:37.332
You know, I talk to people.
       You don't hear it.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.267
They all love you.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.970
I'm serious.
       You don't see it.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.539
People talk about
      what's next for you

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.407
because maybe they
      could get in on it.

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.543
Because you're a big deal.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.981
I-- I have a perspective on this
    that I think you don't.

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:56.351
I see how great you are.
   I don't see the problems.

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.256
You'll get it perfect next time,
           all right?

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:05.326
Sweetheart?

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.764
You can't stay there forever.

01:11:12.002 --> 01:11:13.368
Sweetheart.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:17.538
I really feel just terrible

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.774
about last night.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.578
I sincerely believed that I was
  coming down with something.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580
And I took a syrup for the flu.

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:28.616
And I was off with the fairies.
            [laughs]

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:31.386
And I just-- I got so upset.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:37.759
And, Rosalyn, I wanna thank you
  for... For looking after me.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:39.894
Oh...

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:44.999
If I'd have known
        you were unwell,

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.402
I wouldn't have asked you
            to sing.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:51.339
And the press
 might've been more forgiving.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.042
But can you forgive me?

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.681
It's forgotten.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.450
The question is...

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:05.887
how are you feeling today?

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:09.691
Well, as it happens,
        I feel terrific.

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:13.394
We have a man
I'd encourage you to see.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.464
He does vitamin injections.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.569
Whatever you'd like me to do.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.507
Right.
     Would you sing for me,

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:27.775
-please?
             -Sing?

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:30.111
[doctor] Any scale will do.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.480
[clears throat]

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.018
[hums]

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.355
-[Judy clears throat]
         -Good, and up.

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:48.996
[hums shakily]

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:52.934
[clears throat]

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:57.538
Right, well...

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.575
it's not in a good way, is it?

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.544
[chuckles]

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.413
Have there been any surgeries?

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:08.950
Tracheotomy.
         Two years ago.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.487
Tried to kill myself.

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:14.822
That won't have
       helped your voice.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.057
Hmm.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:20.161
Hepatitis as well.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:22.897
Look, do you take anything
        for depression?

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:24.932
Four husbands.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:28.903
Didn't work.

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.506
I'd say you're underweight.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:34.008
Well, you're flirting
          with me now.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.112
Mr. Delfont asked me
     to give you something,

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.781
so I'm going to give you

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.750
a vitamin injection
  and some anti-inflammatories

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:46.454
for your vocal cords.
 What you really need is rest.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:47.522
Mm!

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:49.824
At home, with my children.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:53.561
-Precisely. With your feet up.
            -Mm-hmm.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.605
[doctor] Good.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:07.108
Ooh! [chuckles]

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:11.813
Do you know, I, uh...

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:17.485
I had an absolute thing
       for Dorothy Gale.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:19.187
My goodness.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.024
A lot of boys
      liked her pigtails.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.362
Yeah. For me, it was...

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:28.663
It was more about
 how she took care of her dog.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:34.569
You might be the most English
       man I've ever met.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.939
Judy...

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.809
you need to take better care
          of yourself.

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.645
You understand?

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:49.183
-Do you understand?
          -[Judy] Mm.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:06.267
[Mickey] <i> So there's a guy</i>
         <i> I mentioned.</i>

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:07.568
[Judy] Mm-hmm.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:09.237
Desperate to do a deal with you.

01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.705
-[Judy] Mm-hmm.
        -[Mickey] Okay.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:15.276
His thing is a chain of maybe
   500 movie theaters, okay?

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:18.880
Each one is called
 a Judy Garland Picture House.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:19.947
Every one?

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:23.050
All you gotta do for each one
        is you open it,

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:26.053
and you get 10% of sales.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:27.889
-Ten percent?
        -Ten percent.

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.091
He tried to make it seven,
      but I pushed him up.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:31.893
And I don't have to
       do anything else?

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.628
No touring, nothing.

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:37.765
You get to pay off your debts,
      you buy that house,

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:41.202
and you see your kids
       every single day.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.038
-Mickey.
         -You're free.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.073
Isn't that the greatest thing
        you ever heard?

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.075
Yes, it's the greatest thing.

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:50.545
Oh, darling.

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:53.014
-Good news, right?
       -[chuckling] Yes.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.251
Yeah, just had to tell you that.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:01.756
This isn't so bad, is it?

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:05.026
I mean, I know it's not family,
             but...

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.028
You're family.

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:09.664
That's how I feel.

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:12.266
Yeah?

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:16.003
I have an incredible feeling
       about you, Mickey.

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:18.272
Look what you're doing.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.708
Look how you take care of me.

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:24.045
I mean, it's completely crazy,

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.913
-but--
      -But it's very real.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.115
Yeah, I know.

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.650
I know.

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:34.655
Are you happy?

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.726
Yeah... I am.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.096
You and me.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.297
You and me.

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:46.934
I want us to get married.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:51.839
I feel like any moment
  we're not married is wasted.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.743
I mean, do you
    remember Scotty Beckett?

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:59.246
He played my kid brother in
       <i> Listen, Darling  </i>
         in '37 or '38.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:02.283
He was the sweetest kid.
 And last year, just like that,

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.918
he's dead from something
           or other.

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:07.154
That and...
      I'm happy with you.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:10.091
And shouldn't we
       grab hold of that?

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:11.959
[chuckles]

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:15.096
I-- I'm here, aren't I?

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.131
That's a hell of an answer.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:20.167
Sweetheart, I already said
  I love you nine times today.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:22.136
Well, maybe I need ten,

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:25.973
or 12, once an hour,
      like a cuckoo clock.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:27.908
Cuckoo!
          I love you!

01:17:29.946 --> 01:17:31.045
Well?

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:33.047
[reporters yelling indistinctly]

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.049
[cameras clicking]

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:40.087
-[Mickey] Mm.
         -[Judy laughs]

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.689
To the happy couple.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.324
-Cheers.
            -Cheers.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:48.229
[Rosalyn]
    It's our present to you,

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:50.231
so you just trust me, okay?

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:53.701
Judy, Judy, you go to the front.

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.670
It's a surprise.
        It's a surprise.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:57.672
Burt, are you ready?

01:17:58.207 --> 01:17:59.874
[Burt] I think the bloody
       matches are damp.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:02.777
Matches?
    I'm a little terrified.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.312
This way you can say you've had
   an English church wedding.

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:08.015
-[Burt] Here we go!
          -[screaming]

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.117
<i> ¶ For once in my life ¶</i>

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.954

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:19.260

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:47.455
[Mickey] No, no, no.
  We can tie this off. Look...

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:50.991
[Mickey stammering]

01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:52.993
Well, then, let me come
    and see you, all right?

01:18:52.995 --> 01:18:55.763
Any points we need to look at
we can do in person, all right?

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:58.799
That mean--
 That's the way I do business.

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:02.269
Yeah, All right. Don't make any
   decisions now, all right?

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:05.906
I mean, you gotta give me that.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.261
All right, yeah, well,

01:19:10.262 --> 01:19:12.212
I'll be on the red-eye.
    All right, see you soon.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.848
Thank you very much.

01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:24.091
<i> ¶ For once in my life ¶</i>

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.128
<i> ¶ I won't let sorrow</i>
         <i> Hurt me... ¶</i>

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.396
I just wanted to give you
     something to look at,

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.031
show you what
      I'm thinking about,

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:33.868
percolating on for a few weeks
          right now...

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.338
<i> ¶ For once I have something</i>
         <i> I know... ¶</i>

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.340
She is a rare thing.

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:43.110
There's only one of her.

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:45.813
<i> ¶ Anymore ¶</i>

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:50.084

[knocks]

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:33.961
[Sid] Hello, Judy.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.529
Sid?

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.364
Got time for a drink?

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:46.373
So I hear you got married again.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.276
-Congratulations.
       -[Judy] Thank you.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.048
How have the shows been?

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.917
They've been wonderful.
           I'm a hit.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:01.121
Well, maybe you'll make it
     as a singer after all.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:04.191
-I think I at least have a shot.
             -Hmm.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:14.101
Who's looking after the kids?

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:15.569
They're being looked after.

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:17.972
By whom?

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:19.607
A maid?

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.579
Maybe we, uh...

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:29.049
Maybe it's time we...

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:31.886
-put all the lawyers aside.
           -[scoffs]

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:34.188
Can't afford them either, huh?

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.924
You and I need to work out
   what's best for the kids.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.392
They need to know...

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:42.196
how their general
     situation's gonna be.

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.632
-I'm coming back for them.
     -The kids need a home.

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:48.068
-I can give them that.
    -I know what kids need.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.204
-They need their mother.
    -They also need school,

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:53.407
and friends
    they can rely on seeing.

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:55.175
No.

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:56.577
-Come on.
           -No, Sid.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.612
-Judy.
            -No. No!

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:02.149
I'm working harder
  than you would ever believe.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.651
-Are you?
        -And right now,

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:05.920
my husband is making
         a deal for me

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:08.122
-that means I can start over.
     -You're not listening.

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:09.623
I have someone
       I can rely on now.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:11.558
Someone who's helping me
           make money

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.294
instead of losing it
         at the track.

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:15.629
-Can we not--
   -I'm going to get a place.

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:18.265
And they're going
        to live with me.

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.976
I don't want them
       on stage with me,

01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:33.047
I don't want them
    in this phony business,

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:37.051
and I don't want them anywhere
 near the bastards who run it.

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:44.124
But you have to let me be with
           them, Sid.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.294
I'm a good mother.

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:56.303
I know you try.

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.375
That's a sneaky little jab
          in the guts.

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:06.013
I know what a bad mother is.
       I lived with one.

01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:08.382
They love you.
            They do.

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:11.385
They miss you,
    and they wanna see you.

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:13.988
And they also wanna stay put.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.525
That's what they want.

01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:20.394
-That's the truth.
           -Stay put?

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.663
-That's what they told me.
      -Stay put with you.

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.199
-That's what they told me.
            -I see.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.435
And I'm just supposed
   to take your word for it.

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:32.072
-What, you think I'm an idiot?
             -Judy.

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:33.407
You think I'm an idiot?

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:35.609
Do you think I'd take your word
        for anything,

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:37.244
you lousy son of a bitch?

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:40.180
That my children would wanna
  live anywhere that I'm not?

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.516
-Keep it down.
        -It's not true!

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.119
-Keep your voice down.
        -It's not true!

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:48.689
I knew you were low,
        but, Jesus, Sid.

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:51.058
No.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.193
-Sit down.
              -No.

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.183
Mickey?

01:24:18.087 --> 01:24:19.153
Hey.

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:23.724
-Thank God you're back.
       -[Mickey chuckles]

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:27.227
Never again. Do you hear me?
 You can't leave me like that.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:30.164
-All right
    -[Judy] Did you miss me?

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:31.732
-Of course.
             -Yeah?

01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:33.801
-I got you something.
           -You did?

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.371
-No. [gasps]
-The shop didn't carry wrapping.

01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:42.543
I love it. I love it.
    Oh, darling, thank you.

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:44.378
Thank you.

01:24:45.448 --> 01:24:46.713
What time is it?

01:24:46.715 --> 01:24:48.649
-Uh--
  -They'll be waiting for me.

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:51.485
Oh, the day I've had.

01:24:51.654 --> 01:24:54.221
-[Mickey] What happened?
      -[scoffs] I just...

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.223
I need a drink.

01:24:56.225 --> 01:24:58.092
-Would you mind?
      -[Mickey] Of course.

01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:01.695
How was New York?
          How'd it go?

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:05.566
You know, we need to send some
      of the advance money

01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:08.635
to my lawyer straight away.
    I wanna reopen custody.

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:10.571
And I feel like, you know,
          I should...

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:12.606
at least pay him something,
           you know?

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:15.509
Um... sweetheart?

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:16.743
[Judy] <i> Yeah?</i>

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:23.317
Yeah?

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:28.989
What's wrong?

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.523
It didn't, uh...
    turn out like I wanted.

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:32.593
What do you mean?

01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:35.295
The deal.

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:38.398
It... It didn't work out.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.235
-I don't understand.
             -Yeah.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:43.637
You have to keep singing
     for a while, I think.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:45.539
You have more dates
      at Talk of The Town.

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:48.842
No, I can't keep touring.
 I have to go home to my kids.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:51.345
I have to go home.
         You promised.

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:55.349
-I tried my best, Judy, okay?
       -No, you promised.

01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:57.351
Look, I tried to make
       something happen,

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:59.419
but they had other ideas,
           all right?

01:25:59.622 --> 01:26:01.688
-Why?
             -Why?

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:05.225
-I don't know.
    -Yeah, why? Why, Mickey?

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:07.728
Showing up late,
    cursing at the audience.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.530
Their wives read about that
         in the papers.

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:10.631
They got cold feet.

01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:14.601
So I messed it up?

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.437
That's their opinion about it.
    If you wanna know, yeah.

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.241
And what's your opinion,
            Mickey?

01:26:21.243 --> 01:26:23.177
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
           I'm sorry.

01:26:23.179 --> 01:26:26.246
[stammering] I don't think
     it's anybody's fault.

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:29.283
I think maybe I could've asked
    more questions upfront.

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:30.417
[Judy] Oh, my God.

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:32.819
Maybe you could have laid off
    the stuff a little bit.

01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:34.955
Oh, so you do think
         it's my fault?

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:37.624
-I didn't say that.
            -You do.

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:39.793
-You think it's my fault.
  -Of course it's your fault!

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:42.429
[sighs]

01:26:50.506 --> 01:26:51.605
So, uh...

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.608
what is it...

01:26:55.277 --> 01:26:58.812
What is that you do,
        anyway, Mickey?

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:01.582
What does that mean?

You're just like
      all the other ones.

You sit on the sidelines

         things happen.

 Maybe one of you should do it.

So, what's next?

01:37:32.581 --> 01:37:35.281
Well, there'll be something.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:39.018
Or maybe I'll just wait tables.

-I might come with you.
         -[Judy gasps]

01:37:40.889 --> 01:37:44.357

    fellows who tip heavily.

-[Rosalyn] Hmm.
             -Hmm.

01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.906

01:37:59.908 --> 01:38:02.942

          bowling ball

-kind of guy.
      -[Rosalyn chuckles]

But, uh...

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:09.048
Oh, I was mad about him.

01:38:10.585 --> 01:38:12.485
And he turned me down flat.

01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:16.139
Hmm.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.189
At least, that's how
         I remember it.

01:38:19.661 --> 01:38:21.561
Are you going to be all right?

01:38:24.266 --> 01:38:25.431
Sure.

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:34.908
It's snowing outside,
         which I like.

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:37.911
I have three beautiful children.

01:38:37.913 --> 01:38:41.014
I have a lot to be grateful for.

01:38:46.955 --> 01:38:49.555
Could I come back with you?

01:38:51.626 --> 01:38:53.393
You want to see the show?

01:38:54.663 --> 01:38:56.963
I still believe in it, you know?

01:38:57.933 --> 01:39:00.166
The love you find
       with an audience.

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:03.469
On a good night.

01:39:06.408 --> 01:39:09.375

        of a performer.

Are you sure?

01:39:16.318 --> 01:39:18.351
Sorry, what do you mean,
        Lonnie Donegan?

01:39:18.353 --> 01:39:20.620
We bought tickets
      to see Judy Garland.

01:39:20.622 --> 01:39:22.255
-Yes.
   -There's nothing I can do.

01:39:22.257 --> 01:39:24.324

   You call the manager now!

-A refund. Just get us a refund.
         -Call him now!

01:39:28.063 --> 01:39:30.563
Well, I'll be out front
        if you need me.

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:32.565
Enjoy it.

01:39:33.735 --> 01:39:35.201

Really, we're done.

I didn't think I'd see you here.

Oh, well, I'm just here

Do you think...

01:41:17.439 --> 01:41:20.606
Could I give them just one song?

    that I'll be here again,

Well, I suppose they have bought
their tickets hoping to see you.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.106
Go on.

01:41:54.242 --> 01:41:55.441

01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:44.290
<i> ¶ I'm gonna love you ¶</i>

01:42:44.292 --> 01:42:46.926
<i> ¶ Like nobody's loved you ¶</i>

01:42:46.928 --> 01:42:51.931
<i> ¶ Come rain</i>
      <i> Or come shine... ¶</i>

01:42:54.335 --> 01:42:55.601
I know that song.

01:42:56.771 --> 01:42:58.604
She's on, she's on.

01:42:58.606 --> 01:43:00.339
Tickets. Tickets.

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:01.641

          -I'm coming.

01:43:01.643 --> 01:43:03.709
<i> ¶ Or come shine ¶</i>

01:43:04.245 --> 01:43:08.848
<i> ¶ I guess when you met me ¶</i>

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:14.687
<i> ¶ It was just</i>
     <i> One of those days ¶</i>

01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:19.959
<i> ¶ But don't ever bet me ¶</i>

01:43:20.428 --> 01:43:23.362
<i> ¶ 'Cause I'm gonna be true ¶</i>

01:43:23.364 --> 01:43:25.631
<i> ¶ If you let me ¶</i>

01:43:26.768 --> 01:43:32.205
<i> ¶ You're gonna love me</i>
   <i> Like nobody's loved me ¶</i>

<i> ¶ Come rain</i>
       <i> Or come shine ¶</i>

01:43:38.313 --> 01:43:43.449
<i> ¶ Happy together</i>
      <i> Unhappy together ¶</i>

01:43:44.986 --> 01:43:48.387
<i> ¶ Won't it be fine? ¶</i>

01:43:48.556 --> 01:43:53.593
<i> ¶ Days may be cloudy</i>
          <i> Or sunny ¶</i>

01:43:53.761 --> 01:43:59.465
<i> ¶ We're in or we're out</i>
        <i> Of the money ¶</i>

01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:02.568

01:44:15.984 --> 01:44:18.718
<i> ¶ I'm gonna love you ¶</i>

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.622

01:44:22.624 --> 01:44:27.660
<i> ¶ High as a mountain</i>
    <i> And deep as a river ¶</i>

01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:29.862

01:44:29.864 --> 01:44:32.765
<i> ¶ I'm gonna love you</i>
     <i> I'm gonna love you ¶</i>

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:36.636
<i> ¶ I'm gonna love you... ¶</i>

01:44:37.038 --> 01:44:39.272
What on earth is she doing?

01:44:41.309 --> 01:44:42.808
I don't think she can help it.

01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:47.513
<i> ¶ I'm with you, baby ¶</i>

01:44:48.616 --> 01:44:51.784
<i> ¶ I'm with you always ¶</i>

01:44:52.053 --> 01:44:59.292
<i> ¶ Come rain or shine ¶</i>

01:45:01.929 --> 01:45:04.964
[cheering and applause]

01:45:13.675 --> 01:45:14.740
Bravo!

01:45:14.976 --> 01:45:17.410
-Bravo!
            -Bravo!

01:45:26.454 --> 01:45:27.687
Wonderful!

01:45:33.461 --> 01:45:34.593
Thank you.

01:45:35.063 --> 01:45:36.495
Thank you.

01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:38.464
Oh, boy!

01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:42.935
Oh! I don't know...

01:45:43.538 --> 01:45:46.038
I don't know
    what's left in there...

01:45:46.708 --> 01:45:48.341
after that one.

01:45:48.343 --> 01:45:49.475
[laughter]

01:45:49.477 --> 01:45:50.676
But, uh...

01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:52.978
[sighs]

01:45:54.582 --> 01:45:56.382
Let's find out, shall we?

01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:57.917
[audience] Yes!

01:45:59.354 --> 01:46:00.753
[cheering]

01:46:01.089 --> 01:46:02.888
[whistling]

01:46:07.462 --> 01:46:08.828
This next one,

01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:13.566
it isn't a song about getting
           anywhere.

01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:16.469
It's about...

01:46:18.573 --> 01:46:22.007
walking toward somewhere

01:46:23.044 --> 01:46:24.810
that you've dreamed of.

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:29.014
And maybe,

01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:31.884
maybe the walk...

01:46:34.155 --> 01:46:37.990
is every day of your life.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:44.430
And the walking has to be
            enough.

01:46:48.836 --> 01:46:49.769
It's about hope.

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:55.875
And we all need that.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.514
["Somewhere Over
     the Rainbow" playing]

01:47:14.962 --> 01:47:17.696
<i> ¶ Somewhere ¶</i>

01:47:18.533 --> 01:47:21.834
<i> ¶ Over the rainbow ¶</i>

01:47:24.105 --> 01:47:28.674
<i> ¶ Way up high ¶</i>

01:47:31.546 --> 01:47:37.149
<i> ¶ There's a land</i>
     <i> That I've heard of ¶</i>

01:47:38.453 --> 01:47:43.122
<i> ¶ Once in a lullaby ¶</i>

01:47:47.061 --> 01:47:53.098
<i> ¶ Somewhere over the rainbow ¶</i>

01:47:54.135 --> 01:47:57.803
<i> ¶ Skies are blue ¶</i>

01:48:01.776 --> 01:48:07.980
<i> ¶ And the dreams</i>
   <i> That you dare to dream ¶</i>

01:48:09.617 --> 01:48:12.785
<i> ¶ Really do come true ¶</i>

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:19.225
<i> ¶ Someday</i>
   <i> I'll wish upon a star ¶</i>

01:48:19.794 --> 01:48:21.594
<i> ¶ And wake up ¶</i>

01:48:21.896 --> 01:48:25.197
<i> ¶ Where the clouds</i>
     <i> Are far behind me ¶</i>

01:48:29.904 --> 01:48:34.039
<i> ¶ Where troubles</i>
   <i> Melt like lemon drops ¶</i>

01:48:34.542 --> 01:48:38.978
<i>¶ Away above the chimney tops ¶</i>

01:48:39.113 --> 01:48:41.113
<i> ¶ That's where ¶</i>

01:48:41.249 --> 01:48:47.286
<i> ¶ You'll find me ¶</i>

01:48:49.724 --> 01:48:51.857
<i> ¶ Somewhere ¶</i>

01:48:54.295 --> 01:48:57.129
<i> ¶ Over the rainbow ¶</i>

01:49:02.236 --> 01:49:04.036
<i> ¶ Bluebirds... ¶</i>

01:49:14.048 --> 01:49:15.581
I'm sorry.

01:49:24.025 --> 01:49:25.691
I can't.

01:49:34.635 --> 01:49:40.005
<i> ¶ Somewhere over the rainbow ¶</i>

01:49:40.341 --> 01:49:44.310
<i> ¶ Way up high ¶</i>

01:49:44.679 --> 01:49:49.882
[both] <i> ¶ There's a land</i>
      <i> That I heard of ¶</i>

01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:54.787
<i> ¶ Once in a lullaby ¶</i>

01:49:55.256 --> 01:50:01.160
[woman]
 <i> ¶ Somewhere over the rainbow ¶</i>

01:50:01.829 --> 01:50:05.831
[all] <i> ¶ Skies are blue ¶</i>

01:50:06.334 --> 01:50:12.638
<i> ¶ And the dreams</i>
   <i> That you dare to dream ¶</i>

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.941
<i> ¶ Really do come true ¶</i>

01:50:16.978 --> 01:50:18.043
[cheering]

01:50:18.045 --> 01:50:20.613
Oh! I love you all.

01:50:21.682 --> 01:50:23.849
You won't forget me, will you?

01:50:26.354 --> 01:50:27.886
Promise you won't.

01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:29.989
