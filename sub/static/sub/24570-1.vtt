Once we approve frame,

Once again,

You look great.

Everybody needs to clear.

00:20.286 --> 00:22.554
Okay. How are you feeling?

Demi Lovato: <i>
 I actually had anxiety</i>

00:23.823 --> 00:26.559
around this... interview.

00:26.591 --> 00:29.361
Why is that?

00:29.394 --> 00:31.463
Because the last time I did
an interview this long,

00:31.496 --> 00:33.066
I was on cocaine.

00:33.098 --> 00:36.201
It was called "Staying Strong."

 secrets make you sick.</i>

01:05.897 --> 01:08.634
<i> And loneliness is brutal.</i>

01:10.769 --> 01:12.371
<i> I've learned that
 the key to being happy</i>

01:12.403 --> 01:14.439

04:56.928 --> 04:59.798
a girl who was popular.

<i> And, one day, I asked her,</i>

05:03.869 --> 05:05.471
"How do you have
all these friends?"

05:05.504 --> 05:06.806
And she was like,
"Well, do you party?"

I was like, "What do you mean?"

We experienced
a lot of stuff together,

drinking, and using,
and... growing up.

Marissa Callahan: <i>
 We started drinking
 fairly early.</i>

05:21.420 --> 05:24.023
To me, it was like,
"We're just having fun.

Little did we know that

05:30.896 --> 05:32.899

this downward spiral.

<i> My first time</i>

05:40.004 --> 05:42.574
<i> working on Disney Channel,
 and...</i>

05:42.608 --> 05:45.009
I was with
a couple of friends.

05:45.043 --> 05:47.780
<i> And they introduced me to it.</i>

05:47.812 --> 05:50.483
I was scared because
my mom always told me

05:50.516 --> 05:53.486
that your heart could
just burst if you do it.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.588
But I did it anyways,

05:55.620 --> 05:57.423
and I loved it.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.428
<i> I felt out of control
 with the coke</i>

06:02.461 --> 06:04.097
the first time that I did it.

06:06.464 --> 06:07.432
<i> My dad</i>

06:07.466 --> 06:09.535
was an addict and an alcoholic.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.670
<i> And...</i>

06:12.704 --> 06:15.574
I guess I always searched
for what he found in
drugs and alcohol

06:15.607 --> 06:19.011
because it fulfilled him
and he chose that over a family.

Dianna De La Garza: <i>
 Early on,</i>

06:22.079 --> 06:24.149
Demi was very, very sad

<i> ( music playing )</i>

06:30.956 --> 06:32.792

a lot of the same things,

06:32.824 --> 06:36.127
<i> kind of at the same time.</i>

06:36.161 --> 06:39.697
Our parents were both divorced
at a young age.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.600
<i> She dealt a lot with her dad.</i>

06:42.634 --> 06:45.204
<i> And the times where
 he was brought up</i>

06:45.237 --> 06:46.639
wasn't ever good.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.442
<i> Like, he would tell them</i>

06:49.475 --> 06:51.043
he had cancer when he didn't.

06:51.076 --> 06:55.713
<i> Or he would tell them
 he's dying tomorrow</i>

06:55.747 --> 06:58.718
<i> when he wasn't.</i>

07:00.918 --> 07:04.757

 Growing up, I was always
 really protective of Demi.</i>

07:04.790 --> 07:05.790
<i> I remember my dad</i>

07:05.824 --> 07:07.927
<i> was such a loving person,</i>

07:07.959 --> 07:08.927
<i> But,</i>

07:08.961 --> 07:10.728
when he started drinking,

07:10.762 --> 07:13.499
<i> he was very different.</i>

07:13.531 --> 07:14.699
Dianna: <i>
 Scary things</i>

07:14.733 --> 07:16.035
began to happen.

07:16.067 --> 07:19.838
Dallas: <i>
 He would rage, and yell,</i>

07:19.872 --> 07:21.473
<i> and throw things.</i>

07:21.507 --> 07:22.641
<i> And...</i>

07:22.673 --> 07:25.076
<i> Demi saw that.</i>

07:25.110 --> 07:27.513
Dianna: <i>
 At the time,
 I didn't understand it.</i>

07:27.545 --> 07:30.682
<i> I didn't know
 how to handle things.</i>

07:30.716 --> 07:33.786
<i> But I knew that</i>

07:33.819 --> 07:35.788
he had a good heart.

07:35.821 --> 07:38.958
<i> I never would've married him
 in the first place</i>

07:38.990 --> 07:40.992
<i> if he didn't.</i>

07:41.026 --> 07:44.062
But sometimes,
if you don't get help

07:44.096 --> 07:46.064
for what you're struggling with,

07:46.098 --> 07:50.735
<i> a good heart
 sometimes isn't enough.</i>

07:50.769 --> 07:54.807

 I was depressed</i>

<i> Fascinated with death.</i>

<i>Wondering what it would be like</i>

08:58.903 --> 09:00.572

I never knew why I would think

09:04.710 --> 09:09.114
<i> so darkly.</i>

09:09.147 --> 09:10.583

09:31.302 --> 09:32.937
<i> when I was, like, five.</i>

09:32.971 --> 09:34.940
And by modeling,
we didn't have an agent,

09:34.972 --> 09:36.007
we just took pictures.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.243

like, any actual jobs.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.282
<i> Then we started doing
 beauty pageants</i>

10:06.738 --> 10:11.377
she... had the nerve to go up
in front of the entire school

10:11.409 --> 10:14.812
<i> to sing Celine Dion's</i>

10:14.846 --> 10:16.280
"My Heart Will Go On."

10:16.313 --> 10:18.317
( cheering and applause )

10:18.350 --> 10:22.187
<i> And it was beautiful.</i>

10:22.220 --> 10:23.788
That was the first time
I thought, "Okay,

10:23.822 --> 10:25.224
this is probably what
she's gonna want to do

10:25.256 --> 10:26.257
the rest of her life."

10:28.092 --> 10:29.360
Demi: <i>
 We tried really hard
 to get an agent</i>

10:29.394 --> 10:30.863
We couldn't get an agent.

10:30.895 --> 10:32.830
It was auditions,
like, all the time.

10:32.864 --> 10:35.033
Madison De La Garza: <i>
 I just remember
 a lot of auditions</i>

10:35.067 --> 10:36.435
and a lot of car rides.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.269
I have so many memories of

10:38.302 --> 10:39.437
Demi getting a phone call,

10:39.471 --> 10:41.874
<i> and then not getting the job.</i>

10:41.907 --> 10:43.208
We would be really upset

10:43.240 --> 10:45.811
<i> for a few days,
 and then one day...</i>

10:45.844 --> 10:46.945
Is the band here?

10:46.977 --> 10:48.046
Not yet.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.782
Dianna: <i>
 She got "Barney."</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:52.051
Demi: <i>
 After I booked "Barney",</i>

10:52.083 --> 10:54.219
<i> I was constantly working
 on music and acting.</i>

10:58.123 --> 10:59.291
I was taking lessons

10:59.323 --> 11:01.092
any chance that I could.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.927
Dianna:
Demi, good luck! I love you!

11:02.961 --> 11:04.363
Have fun!

11:04.395 --> 11:06.164
<i> We had been working
 really hard at it</i>

11:06.197 --> 11:10.269
<i> since the pageant days,
 and all of the headshots,</i>

11:10.302 --> 11:11.704
<i> and lessons.</i>

11:11.736 --> 11:13.171
When Demi walked in the room,

11:13.205 --> 11:17.009
<i> I knew that she was
 a flat-out entertainer.</i>

11:17.042 --> 11:20.112
<i> She was standing by my piano,</i>

11:20.144 --> 11:21.212
and she said,
"Can I sing for you?"

11:21.245 --> 11:23.115
And I said, "You bet you can."

Demi: <i>

12:23.207 --> 12:27.379
this outlet to...
pour my emotions out

<i> After I had finished
 "Barney and Friends,"</i>

12:34.519 --> 12:38.056
what I ended up finding out
is that there was actually
a lot of pressure

12:38.089 --> 12:40.926
to find jobs.

12:40.958 --> 12:44.462
And the pressure didn't come
from anybody but myself.

12:44.495 --> 12:47.098
<i> I just wanted to succeed.</i>

12:47.131 --> 12:48.900
( bell on door jingles )

12:48.933 --> 12:50.235
<i> We started coming
 out to California</i>

12:50.268 --> 12:52.104
<i> for pilot season.</i>

12:52.136 --> 12:54.839
I got guest-starring roles
on TV shows,

12:54.873 --> 12:56.341
commercials, things like that.

12:56.374 --> 12:59.211
My stuff? I never heard of them.

12:59.244 --> 13:00.946
And then I ended up booking

13:00.979 --> 13:03.115
<i> a TV show for Disney Channel</i>

13:03.148 --> 13:04.449
-<i> called "As the Bell Rings." </i>
- ( bell rings )

13:04.481 --> 13:06.250
Okay, I think we have something.

13:06.283 --> 13:07.485
Let's put this together.

13:07.519 --> 13:09.855
<i> And after "As the Bell Rings,"</i>

13:09.888 --> 13:11.590
I booked "Camp Rock."

13:11.623 --> 13:13.926
<i> I was 15.</i>

13:13.958 --> 13:14.926
Rock on.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.595
<i> When I met Phil,</i>

13:16.628 --> 13:18.363
he was managing
the Jonas Brothers.

13:18.395 --> 13:19.897
Joe Jonas: <i>
 We met Demi, I think,</i>

13:19.931 --> 13:20.899
<i> originally it was an audition</i>

13:20.932 --> 13:22.967
of our TV show.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.269
<i> We had a TV show
 called "Jonas."</i>

13:25.302 --> 13:27.038
She didn't get it, but...

13:27.072 --> 13:30.174
- ( laughter )
- we...

13:30.207 --> 13:34.212
<i> I think a year later, I think
 we met in rehearsals probably
 for "Camp Rock."</i>

13:34.245 --> 13:36.848
-<i> Demi was attached
 to the film already. </i>
-<i> And I remember</i>

13:36.881 --> 13:38.382
you went in 'cause you
had to sing the duet

13:38.416 --> 13:40.219
<i> with Demi's character.</i>

13:40.251 --> 13:41.452
You had already
laid down your part.

13:41.485 --> 13:43.388
- Mm-hmm.
- I went in with Joe,

13:43.421 --> 13:46.057
and I heard her voice,
I just had, like, goose bumps

13:46.091 --> 13:48.226
all over my arms.

13:48.259 --> 13:50.528
I was like-- I stepped out of
the studio and I called Disney,
I was like,

13:50.562 --> 13:51.996
<i> "Who is this girl?"</i>

13:54.231 --> 13:56.334
I saw what he did
for the Jonas Brothers,

13:56.368 --> 13:59.538
<i> and the fact that he wanted to
manage me was a huge deal to me</i>

13:59.571 --> 14:03.875
<i> because he was with them
 through it all.</i>

14:03.908 --> 14:06.912
Starring in "Camp Rock"
was Demi's big break.

14:06.945 --> 14:10.215
<i>It was just a massive franchise
 that Disney had put</i>

14:10.248 --> 14:12.350
<i> everything behind.</i>

14:12.384 --> 14:14.418
<i> And it just became
 a pop culture,</i>

14:14.451 --> 14:15.921
sort of, sensation.

14:15.953 --> 14:17.088
To be able to

14:17.121 --> 14:18.089
<i> get to do something</i>

14:18.123 --> 14:19.424
<i> as big as this,</i>

14:19.456 --> 14:20.893
<i> um, for my first project,</i>

14:20.926 --> 14:22.261
it feels good.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.995
We really believed
that "Camp Rock"

14:24.028 --> 14:27.099
<i> was the vehicle to become
 a superstar.</i>

14:27.131 --> 14:29.901
And it was like overnight,
she became a household name.

14:29.934 --> 14:32.570
<i> ( music playing )</i>

14:42.647 --> 14:44.182
<i> I think Demi</i>

14:44.215 --> 14:47.152
was cast in so many different
Disney projects

14:47.184 --> 14:51.122
<i> because there was
 a natural edge to her</i>

14:51.155 --> 14:54.625
<i> that made her... authentic</i>

14:54.658 --> 14:55.660
<i> and believable</i>

14:55.693 --> 14:58.229
as an actress or as an artist.

14:58.263 --> 15:00.331
<i> I think they needed her</i>

15:00.365 --> 15:04.369
<i> to make their projects cooler.</i>

15:04.402 --> 15:05.937
Demi: <i>
 Everything happened</i>

15:05.971 --> 15:07.072
so fast.

15:07.105 --> 15:09.541
We officially signed,

15:09.573 --> 15:11.709
<i> and the next day,
 I booked her a plane ticket</i>

15:11.743 --> 15:13.512
<i> to go on tour
 with the Jonas Brothers.</i>

15:13.544 --> 15:15.313
( cheering and applause )

15:17.615 --> 15:18.616
<i> All of a sudden,</i>

15:18.649 --> 15:19.650
<i> I was on tour,</i>

15:19.683 --> 15:20.651
<i> writing songs for my album</i>

15:20.684 --> 15:23.020
<i> with the Jonas Brothers.</i>

15:23.053 --> 15:25.456
<i> And then I was on
 a tour of my own.</i>

15:27.759 --> 15:30.495
<i> Looking back,
 I think that it was a lot</i>

15:30.528 --> 15:32.965
for anyone, let alone,

15:32.998 --> 15:36.100
<i> a kid.</i>

15:36.134 --> 15:39.270
I think that Demi
being on the Disney Channel,

15:39.303 --> 15:41.305
now looking back at it,
I can connect the dots

15:41.339 --> 15:43.208
and say that there was an
immense amount of pressure.

15:44.775 --> 15:47.245
<i> I was now working on my music,</i>

15:47.278 --> 15:51.416
<i> and my TV show and movies</i>

15:51.448 --> 15:53.051
all at the same time.

15:54.619 --> 15:55.754
<i> That lifestyle's really crazy.</i>

15:55.787 --> 15:57.522
Not a lot of people understand,

15:57.554 --> 15:59.357
like, the pressures,
and the time,

15:59.390 --> 16:01.692
<i> and the amount of work
 that it actually takes</i>

16:01.725 --> 16:04.428
<i> to have such
 a successful career</i>

16:04.461 --> 16:05.563
in the entertainment industry.

16:07.532 --> 16:09.167
<i> So many more expectations</i>

16:09.200 --> 16:13.072
put on her than a normal
15, 16-year-old girl would have.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.375
Phil: <i>
 She was living two lives.</i>

16:17.408 --> 16:19.510
Here she was,
she had to be squeaky clean

16:19.543 --> 16:21.579
on the Disney Channel,

16:21.613 --> 16:23.482
<i> all types of moral clauses</i>

16:23.514 --> 16:25.384
<i> and just intensity around</i>

16:25.417 --> 16:28.687
behavior, and,
once the camera stops rolling,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.723
<i> she's living another life;
she couldn't really be herself.</i>

16:31.755 --> 16:33.692
She couldn't be
a normal teenager.

16:36.226 --> 16:37.361
<i> I definitely felt</i>

16:37.394 --> 16:41.600
the pressure increase when...

16:41.633 --> 16:44.636
<i> the fame started to
 creep into my life.</i>

16:44.668 --> 16:46.704
<i> I started feeling pressured to</i>

16:46.738 --> 16:49.241
<i> look a certain way, to...</i>

16:49.274 --> 16:51.243
<i> sing music that I felt</i>

16:51.275 --> 16:53.144
people would like,

16:53.177 --> 16:55.379
rather than sing music
that I would like.

16:55.413 --> 16:58.450
<i> There was more pressure
 to succeed, you know?</i>

16:58.482 --> 17:00.084
<i> Numbers and charts.</i>

17:00.118 --> 17:02.153
And I was a perfectionist,

17:02.187 --> 17:04.088
and I really wanted to be
the best of the best.

17:04.122 --> 17:06.590
<i> ( music playing )</i>

17:06.624 --> 17:09.260
Phil: <i>
 When you are carrying
 a franchise,</i>

17:09.294 --> 17:13.165
there is a standard
that everybody expects
you to operate at.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.333
They were great to work with.

17:15.365 --> 17:16.567
Awful, awful.

17:16.601 --> 17:17.636
<i> I think it caused</i>

17:17.669 --> 17:20.472
a lot of, um, anxiety for her.

17:20.505 --> 17:23.642
Demi: <i>
 And it didn't let up
 at all, it just...</i>

17:23.674 --> 17:25.509
<i> mounted more and more.</i>

17:25.541 --> 17:27.344
<i> All of a sudden,
 she had to be</i>

17:27.377 --> 17:29.548
this role model, and I don't
think she was ready for that.

17:31.548 --> 17:32.850
<i> I think we started to notice,</i>

17:32.884 --> 17:34.586
and, really,
it was the Jonas Brothers

17:34.618 --> 17:36.320
kind of, like,
waving a flag that

17:36.354 --> 17:37.823
Demi may be veering

17:37.855 --> 17:40.659
<i> off the path.</i>

17:40.692 --> 17:41.859
<i> At that point,
 you could just feel</i>

17:41.893 --> 17:45.663
that... things were
getting wobbly.

17:45.696 --> 17:50.468
<i> It was almost like the wheels
 were starting to fall off.</i>

17:50.501 --> 17:53.771
<i> Prior to that, I think,
 anything that was going on,</i>

17:53.805 --> 17:55.340
<i> would've been chalked up to...</i>

17:55.373 --> 17:57.709
<i> she's a teenage girl.</i>

17:57.741 --> 18:00.111
<i> That was, like,
 the easy answer,</i>

18:00.144 --> 18:02.346
was just to say,
"Well, she's a teenage girl

18:02.380 --> 18:03.381
and she's going through stuff,

18:03.413 --> 18:05.750
<i> and she's being dramatic."</i>

18:05.782 --> 18:08.385
John: <i>
 She wasn't this sweet
 and lovely girl anymore,</i>

18:08.419 --> 18:10.122
<i>and it was kind of like a "Hey,</i>

18:10.154 --> 18:11.889
<i> ( bleep ) you."
 And, "I just want to be a kid</i>

18:11.923 --> 18:14.759
and do what everybody else does.
And, like, my friends in Texas

18:14.791 --> 18:17.628
<i>want to, like, drink and party,
 so why shouldn't I
 drink and party?"</i>

18:19.463 --> 18:21.700
Phil: <i>
 Demi had real anger issues.</i>

18:24.769 --> 18:27.271
John: <i>
Difficult, harder to be around.</i>

18:27.305 --> 18:29.541
No, no, no, just show me,
I have a photographic memory.

18:29.574 --> 18:31.543
<i> Demi's pulling anyone
 that she could, like,</i>

18:31.576 --> 18:34.278
<i> manipulate and change.</i>

18:34.311 --> 18:38.182
Phil: <i>
 She was depressed,
 she would sleep all the time.</i>

18:38.215 --> 18:42.286
I think she just--
it became obvious that
she was struggling with...

18:42.319 --> 18:44.855
<i> herself.</i>

18:44.888 --> 18:47.391
And I didn't realize that it was
actually signaling

18:47.424 --> 18:49.394
<i> a larger issue.</i>

18:51.563 --> 18:53.365
Nick Jonas: <i>
 While we were on tour,</i>

18:53.397 --> 18:56.400
Joe and Demi's relationship
had become really complicated.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.603
<i> So I was playing the bridge.</i>

18:58.635 --> 18:59.637
<i> And it became really good,</i>

18:59.671 --> 19:02.474
you know, between she and I

19:02.507 --> 19:06.644
<i>for a while, and growing closer
 than we'd ever been.</i>

19:06.678 --> 19:08.380
And I remember thinking
in my head,

19:08.413 --> 19:10.448
I felt, like,
a bit of pride about it,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.684
like... selfishly, maybe.
I was like,

19:13.718 --> 19:15.653
"I'm helping her back into,
you know, 

19:15.686 --> 19:18.222
<i> coming back to being the Demi
 that we all know and love,</i>

19:18.256 --> 19:19.891
<i>and she's not gonna do anything
 crazy, it's gonna be fine."</i>

19:19.923 --> 19:21.759
And then this episode happened.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.395
<i> ( music playing )</i>

19:28.932 --> 19:30.835
Demi: <i>
 I was in Colombia.</i>

19:30.867 --> 19:33.270
I was on
the "Camp Rock 2" Tour.

19:33.304 --> 19:37.375
<i> And I invited a bunch of
 people to dinner,</i>

19:37.407 --> 19:39.310
<i> my band,</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:42.581
and my background dancers.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.481
I paid for all the alcohol.

19:44.515 --> 19:45.884
<i> Somebody ended up</i>

19:45.916 --> 19:48.220
getting weed.

19:48.252 --> 19:49.486
I was on Adderall.

19:49.519 --> 19:51.623
<i> And...</i>

19:51.655 --> 19:52.957
we had trashed the hotel.

19:52.990 --> 19:56.228
<i> The hotel was,
 like, threatening us.</i>

19:56.260 --> 19:58.495
They went to some of the dancers
and asked what had happened.

19:58.528 --> 20:00.598
<i> And I think they told</i>

20:00.632 --> 20:02.901
on me for using Adderall.

20:05.369 --> 20:07.871
Somebody told Kevin Jonas, Sr.,

20:07.904 --> 20:10.341
<i> and... Phil.</i>

20:10.375 --> 20:13.612
and my dad.

20:13.644 --> 20:16.013
I was very upset.

20:16.047 --> 20:18.717
<i> I couldn't believe
 what had happened.</i>

20:18.750 --> 20:19.951
<i> Now it was out</i>

20:19.983 --> 20:21.653
that I was on Adderall.

20:23.654 --> 20:24.990
The next day,

20:25.022 --> 20:28.459
<i> I was in a lot of trouble.</i>

20:28.492 --> 20:31.829
I remember...

20:31.863 --> 20:33.431
going to Kevin, Sr.
and saying,

20:33.463 --> 20:35.532
<i> "Listen...</i>

20:35.566 --> 20:38.502
I want to thank whoever
told on me because

20:38.536 --> 20:41.972
<i> I know they were
 just worried about me.</i>

20:42.006 --> 20:44.875
<i> And, you know, I just really
 want to know who told you."</i>

20:44.909 --> 20:48.513
And I manipulated him
into telling me who it was.

20:48.546 --> 20:50.715
And he said it was Shorty.

20:50.748 --> 20:53.884
<i> Shorty and I
 had been really close</i>

20:53.917 --> 20:56.787
<i> through "Camp Rock"
 and "Camp Rock 2."</i>

20:56.820 --> 20:57.955
<i> So...</i>

20:57.989 --> 20:59.923
<i> when he said Shorty,</i>

20:59.957 --> 21:01.893
I remember thinking...

21:01.925 --> 21:05.062
"I'm about to
beat this bitch up."

21:05.096 --> 21:08.333
<i> ( music playing )</i>

21:08.365 --> 21:09.968
John: <i>
 I remember I was up in
 the front of the plane.</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:11.735
She had already
boarded the plane.

21:11.769 --> 21:14.005
John: <i>
 Demi walks up
 onto the plane and</i>

21:14.038 --> 21:15.006
I heard some commotion.

21:15.038 --> 21:16.540
I just went up to her.

21:18.576 --> 21:20.644
- And it was like a blur.
- I turned around and Demi had

21:20.678 --> 21:23.048
punched her backup dancer
in the face.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.782
Everyone was freaking out.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.318
She walked right past me
without acknowledging me.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.387
I just remember
going and sitting down.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.389
Just this angry
look on her face.

21:31.422 --> 21:32.824
Texting my mom "I'm sorry."

21:32.856 --> 21:34.459
Put her head on her pillow

21:34.491 --> 21:36.327
and shut out the world.

21:36.361 --> 21:40.065
And I slept the whole day.

21:40.097 --> 21:42.866
That was when
it dawned on me that

21:42.900 --> 21:44.869
this was probably a much bigger

21:44.902 --> 21:48.440
situation than just a kid
who wanted to party.

21:52.743 --> 21:53.845
I just came to a breaking point.

21:56.980 --> 22:00.518
<i> ( music playing )</i>

22:00.550 --> 22:01.752
Phil: <i>
 The next 12 months</i>

22:01.786 --> 22:02.854
<i> were extremely difficult.</i>

22:07.458 --> 22:09.928
Demi: <i>
 I was 18 when I first
 went into treatment.</i>

22:09.961 --> 22:12.130
Demi was diagnosed bipolar

22:12.163 --> 22:14.066
when she checked into treatment
the first time.

22:15.732 --> 22:17.801
<i> When I got diagnosed
 with bipolar disorder,</i>

22:17.835 --> 22:20.005
it just made sense.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.541
<i> When I was younger,
 I didn't know why</i>

22:24.575 --> 22:26.978
I would stay up so late
writing and playing music.

22:27.010 --> 22:30.414
<i> And then I learned about
 episodes of mania.</i>

22:30.448 --> 22:32.717
And I realized that that's

22:32.750 --> 22:35.953
<i> probably what it was;
 I was manic.</i>

22:35.987 --> 22:38.056
<i> In a way I knew that</i>

22:38.088 --> 22:40.023
it wasn't my fault anymore.

22:40.057 --> 22:42.861
Something was actually off
with me.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.396
Phil: <i>
 She had such a glow to her</i>

22:45.430 --> 22:47.966
<i> the first time I saw her when
 she came out of treatment.</i>

22:47.999 --> 22:51.737
The glow started to fade
each day that passed.

22:53.503 --> 22:54.938
Demi: <i>
 I wasn't working my program,</i>

22:54.971 --> 22:56.607
<i> I wasn't ready to get sober.</i>

22:56.641 --> 23:00.111
<i> I was sneaking it on planes,</i>

23:00.144 --> 23:01.779
<i> sneaking it in bathrooms,</i>

23:01.813 --> 23:02.980
<i> sneaking it throughout
 the night.</i>

23:03.013 --> 23:04.748
Nobody knew.

23:04.781 --> 23:05.849
Phil: <i>
 This is an 18-year-old</i>

23:05.883 --> 23:07.684
<i> who's totally</i>

23:07.718 --> 23:09.120
out-maneuvering adults.

23:09.153 --> 23:11.789
Demi: <i> I went on, like,
 a bender of like</i>

23:11.823 --> 23:14.192
two months where
I was using daily.

23:14.224 --> 23:17.861
<i> And... there was
 one night where</i>

23:17.894 --> 23:20.064
<i> I used a bunch of coke</i>

23:20.096 --> 23:22.500
and I popped a few Xanax bars,

23:22.532 --> 23:25.536
and I started to...
choke a little bit.

23:25.569 --> 23:29.173
<i> And my heart started racing.</i>

23:29.207 --> 23:30.742
<i> And I remember thinking,</i>

23:30.775 --> 23:33.778
"Oh, my God, I might be
overdosing right now."

23:35.212 --> 23:37.147
I remember we were in New York,

23:37.181 --> 23:41.486
<i> and she clearly
 was on something.</i>

23:41.519 --> 23:43.188
<i> And she was on air...</i>

23:43.221 --> 23:45.222
promoting this new way of life.

23:45.256 --> 23:48.560
And I was like,
"You're so full of it."

23:48.593 --> 23:51.229
<i>I wasn't equipped to be able to</i>

23:51.261 --> 23:53.964
<i> handle that situation.</i>

23:53.998 --> 23:57.235
And so I got a list of
several recommendations

23:57.268 --> 23:59.203
of people that
specialize in this.

23:59.237 --> 24:02.673
And I ended up connecting
and speaking with Mike Bayer.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.976
Mike Bayer: <i>
 Demi was on a road to, like,</i>

24:05.009 --> 24:06.743
suicide.

24:06.777 --> 24:08.746
<i> She'd have, like,
 bags of pills,</i>

24:08.778 --> 24:10.080
<i> and an eight-ball of coke.</i>

24:10.114 --> 24:13.518
I was either craving drugs
or on drugs.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.052
She was nasty.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.855
I was not easy to work with.

24:17.888 --> 24:20.657
I was using while I had
a sober companion.

24:20.691 --> 24:23.027
And I went through about 20
different sober companions.

24:23.059 --> 24:25.864
<i> It was really like she was
 two different people.</i>

24:25.896 --> 24:27.965
Every day was like
going to war.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.868
Mike: <i>
 We were in Palm Springs,</i>

24:30.902 --> 24:32.804
<i> and she locked
 her bedroom door,</i>

24:32.836 --> 24:34.204
<i> she's just taken
 a bunch of pills,</i>

24:34.238 --> 24:35.507
<i> we kicked down the door,</i>

24:35.539 --> 24:37.174
<i>she gets taken to the hospital,</i>

24:37.208 --> 24:39.844
the nurse is checking her in,
the bottle of pills is there,

24:39.876 --> 24:43.514
she grabs the pills, she then
downs all the other pills and
says, "You ( bleep ) bitch.

24:43.548 --> 24:46.617
If I just tried to kill myself,
why would you give me
access to pills?"

24:46.651 --> 24:48.620
Demi: <i>
 I didn't feel anything,
 I didn't feel guilty,</i>

24:48.653 --> 24:50.521
<i> I didn't feel embarrassed.</i>

24:50.555 --> 24:52.789
Mike: <i>
 Then she goes from there
 to a psych ward.</i>

24:52.823 --> 24:54.592
<i> None of that did anything.</i>

24:54.625 --> 24:57.161
<i> She still isn't going to
 get clean.</i>

24:57.193 --> 24:59.062
She's so black and white.

24:59.096 --> 25:00.731
She really, one day,
would want to get well,

25:00.765 --> 25:02.033
the next day,
not want to get well.

25:02.066 --> 25:03.567
And when she didn't
want to get well,

25:03.601 --> 25:05.003
she'd have to flip back--
it was just,

25:05.036 --> 25:06.638
for her, it was chaotic.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.640
It was completely exhausting,

25:08.673 --> 25:10.909
<i> physically and emotionally.</i>

25:10.942 --> 25:13.978
I would sneak out, get drugs...

25:14.010 --> 25:15.078
Manipulating.

25:15.112 --> 25:16.314
...I would fake my drugs tests

25:16.346 --> 25:18.215
with other people's pee.

25:18.249 --> 25:20.751
Mike: <i>
 She didn't care
 what the consequences were.</i>

25:20.785 --> 25:22.921
Phil: <i>
 A couple days sober
 and then she'd use.</i>

25:22.953 --> 25:25.123
And I'd lie
straight to their faces.

25:25.155 --> 25:26.957
Mike: <i>
 She didn't care
 about her career.</i>

25:26.990 --> 25:28.792
And we couldn't get
momentum on our side.

25:28.826 --> 25:30.728
Mike: <i>
 It was very difficult</i>

25:30.760 --> 25:32.696
<i> to work off that
 very small part of her</i>

25:32.730 --> 25:33.998
<i> that did want to get well.</i>

25:34.030 --> 25:35.265
It's embarrassing to look back

25:35.298 --> 25:37.134
at the person that I was.

25:40.037 --> 25:42.073
<i> The very last night
 that I drank,</i>

25:42.105 --> 25:43.674
<i> I was at a hotel,</i>

25:43.708 --> 25:46.044
and I invited two random people.

25:46.076 --> 25:49.647
<i> And, basically,
 just drank with them.</i>

25:51.082 --> 25:52.817
<i> I got really, really drunk,</i>

25:52.849 --> 25:56.353
<i> until it was time
 to get on a flight.</i>

25:56.386 --> 25:59.057
And I was so drunk that
I threw up in the back
of the car service

25:59.089 --> 26:01.259
<i> on the way to the airport
 to perform on "American Idol."</i>

26:01.291 --> 26:03.860
Ladies and gentlemen,
Demi Lovato.

26:03.894 --> 26:05.128
( cheering and applause )

26:05.162 --> 26:09.667
♪ When your lips
are on my lips ♪

26:09.700 --> 26:13.304
♪ And our hearts beat as one ♪

26:13.336 --> 26:15.239
Phil: <i>
 Here she is, she goes
 to "American Idol",</i>

26:15.271 --> 26:18.809
<i> she's hung-over, she has
 total disregard for it.</i>

26:18.843 --> 26:20.345
It was a horrible feeling.

26:20.377 --> 26:22.145
I felt like that was
a moment in my career

26:22.179 --> 26:23.848
where I, I didn't care.

26:23.881 --> 26:27.218
Phil: <i>
 Demi was clearly
 in a bad place.</i>

26:27.250 --> 26:29.119
Demi: <i>
 I just knew that
 I needed to be high</i>

26:29.153 --> 26:33.825
<i> to get through what I was
 going through at that point.</i>

26:33.857 --> 26:35.792
Phil: <i>
 I remember asking Mike,</i>

26:35.826 --> 26:37.662
"When is it time

26:37.694 --> 26:39.364
<i> to step away?"</i>

26:39.396 --> 26:41.765
<i> And Mike said to me,</i>

26:41.798 --> 26:43.000
"When she stops trying."

26:45.702 --> 26:47.238
<i> At that moment,</i>

26:47.270 --> 26:51.142
I was fully intending to...

26:51.174 --> 26:53.176
drop her.

26:53.210 --> 26:54.979
<i> You hear about interventions</i>

26:55.011 --> 26:57.414
or families laying ultimatums
and saying, like,

26:57.448 --> 26:59.984
"You either change
or you're out."

27:00.017 --> 27:01.786
<i> Change has to happen,</i>

27:01.818 --> 27:03.320
now.

27:03.354 --> 27:05.390
Mike: <i>
 The most important thing
 to Demi</i>

27:05.423 --> 27:06.923
<i> is losing people,</i>

27:06.957 --> 27:08.860
is losing people
that she cares about

27:08.893 --> 27:10.060
and that loves her.

27:10.094 --> 27:12.930
That's the most
important thing to Demi.

27:12.962 --> 27:15.899
<i> I had developed a plan
 where I got</i>

27:15.932 --> 27:18.368
everybody on the team,
business manager,

27:18.402 --> 27:20.904
attorneys, agents, everybody,

27:20.938 --> 27:23.841
to say, "If Phil walks,
we walk."

27:23.874 --> 27:27.010
<i> This was the showdown
 of all showdowns.</i>

27:27.044 --> 27:28.680
Demi: <i>
 It wasn't a matter of</i>

27:28.712 --> 27:30.815
if they were going to leave,
it was,

27:30.847 --> 27:32.783
"We are leaving.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.919
There's no more
that we can do for you."

27:34.951 --> 27:37.888
Mike: <i>
 I remember her crying,</i>

27:37.922 --> 27:39.390
<i> "Well, what the ( bleep )
 do I need to do?</i>

27:39.423 --> 27:41.259
<i> What do I need to do?"</i>

27:41.291 --> 27:43.026
- Phil: <i> And Mike said... </i>
- Mike: <i> Give us your cell phone.</i>

27:43.059 --> 27:45.395
And I think he said,
"Like, now."

27:45.429 --> 27:47.131
<i> And she picked up the plate.</i>

27:47.163 --> 27:48.365
And she literally
was grabbing this thing

27:48.398 --> 27:51.034
and smashing it,
screaming crying,

27:51.067 --> 27:53.037
like-- and the ugly cry.

27:53.069 --> 27:54.471
Phil: <i>
 And I said,
 "That's not good enough."</i>

27:54.505 --> 27:57.041
Phil said,
"Put it in the water."

27:57.074 --> 28:00.845
Phil: <i> And so she dunked it in
 the vase of water that was
 on the table.</i>

28:02.813 --> 28:04.849
It's wild.

28:04.882 --> 28:06.049
This was the gateway
to everything.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.319
This was...

28:08.352 --> 28:10.221
the wrong people,
it was drug dealers,

28:10.253 --> 28:12.889
it was-- it was a lot of...

28:12.923 --> 28:14.925
the negative influences
in her life

28:14.959 --> 28:16.326
were coming through
the cell phone.

28:16.359 --> 28:19.096
I think that approach
worked for me because,

28:19.130 --> 28:22.734
it sounds silly,
but it was the beginning of

28:22.767 --> 28:24.201
the process of surrendering.

28:24.234 --> 28:27.104
<i> At the end of the day,
 it was my decision.</i>

28:27.137 --> 28:30.774
Meanwhile, she's a judge
on "X-Factor,"

28:30.807 --> 28:33.744
She's 19 years old,

28:33.778 --> 28:37.048
and she's in her first year
of sobriety.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.182
Phil: <i>
 What nobody knows is that,
 while she was a judge,</i>

28:39.215 --> 28:43.353
<i> she's living in
 a sober apartment,</i>

28:43.386 --> 28:47.090
<i> with roommates,
 she is having to do chores,</i>

28:47.124 --> 28:48.425
<i> she has no cell phone,</i>

28:48.459 --> 28:52.230
<i> she is completely
 and totally...</i>

28:52.262 --> 28:54.898
<i> submitted to
 the process of recovery.</i>

28:54.932 --> 28:56.267
<i> You really have to lean into</i>

28:56.299 --> 28:59.069
the people that are
trying to support you.

28:59.103 --> 29:01.038
Like my family,

you sleep with one eye open?

33:53.864 --> 33:55.332
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

33:55.365 --> 33:56.700
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

33:56.732 --> 33:58.769
I swear to God.

33:58.801 --> 34:00.670
Wow, that's so weird.

34:00.703 --> 34:03.240

got to sleep with one eye open? 

34:03.272 --> 34:06.810

34:06.844 --> 34:08.344
It's the first time in awhile

34:08.378 --> 34:11.114

in Texas together.

34:11.148 --> 34:13.150
I think since, like,
the last Christmas,

34:13.181 --> 34:15.385
- that we spent here.
- Dianna: Yeah.

34:15.418 --> 34:17.554
Or, no, a funeral.

<i> ( music playing )</i>

34:19.722 --> 34:21.192

It was my mamaw, my mamaw.

34:31.135 --> 34:33.536
I love you.

34:33.570 --> 34:35.206
- Hmm?
- I love you.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.507
- I love you, too.
- I love you more.

34:36.539 --> 34:39.110
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

Yes, I do.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.216
What are the odds
that we're all back here?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.552
- Yeah.
- On this day.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.856
Almost exactly a year later.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.291
( crying ):
I miss her so much.

34:54.324 --> 34:55.326
( crying ):
Mama!

34:55.358 --> 34:56.494
Sorry.

34:59.896 --> 35:03.867
And then it's also
been a year since...

35:03.900 --> 35:07.437
Wilmer and I broke up.

35:07.471 --> 35:11.641
<i> I've never loved anybody
 like I loved Wilmer.</i>

35:11.675 --> 35:14.711
And, like, I still love Wilmer.

35:14.744 --> 35:18.248
<i> ( music playing )</i>

35:18.282 --> 35:19.383
<i> When I first met Wilmer</i>

35:19.416 --> 35:21.352
he was 29.

35:21.385 --> 35:23.653
<i> I met him on January 11th</i>

35:23.686 --> 35:25.889
of 2010.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.693
<i> And it was at a PSA shoot</i>

35:29.726 --> 35:30.928
<i> at his house</i>

35:30.960 --> 35:32.328
<i> for the 2010</i>

35:32.362 --> 35:33.630
census forms.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.499
Before 1980,

35:35.532 --> 35:38.235
Latinos weren't even considered
a separate ethnic group

35:38.268 --> 35:39.436
on the census form.

35:39.469 --> 35:40.704
This is an opportunity for us

35:40.737 --> 35:41.838
to assert ourselves,

35:41.871 --> 35:43.339
to define ourselves.

35:43.373 --> 35:44.708
<i> To be honest, I only did it</i>

35:44.740 --> 35:46.777
because I heard it
was at his house

35:46.809 --> 35:49.179
and I thought
he was really cute.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.782
I didn't really care about
the census forms.

35:51.815 --> 35:55.385
<i> But when I met him and I laid
eyes on him for the first time,</i>

35:55.418 --> 35:56.586
I was in hair and makeup

35:56.619 --> 35:58.454
and he came and sat down
and I was like,

35:58.487 --> 36:01.491
"I love this man.

36:01.525 --> 36:05.262
And I have to have him."

36:05.295 --> 36:07.764
But I was only 17.

36:07.797 --> 36:10.833
And so he was like,
"Get away from me."

36:10.867 --> 36:13.903
<i> After I had turned 18,</i>

36:13.936 --> 36:15.838
<i> we began dating.</i>

36:15.871 --> 36:18.442
I think it was love
at first sight.

36:18.474 --> 36:20.610
And I don't really
believe in that,

36:20.643 --> 36:23.613
but I believe that it happened.

36:23.646 --> 36:26.250
<i> ( music playing )</i>

36:28.751 --> 36:31.487
<i> We connected on a level that</i>

36:31.521 --> 36:34.825
<i> I've never connected
 with anybody before.</i>

36:34.858 --> 36:38.295
<i> He... was just my rock,</i>

36:38.327 --> 36:40.931
<i> my everything.</i>

36:40.963 --> 36:43.433
Producer: <i>
 Why do you think you broke up?</i>

36:43.467 --> 36:47.905
It had nothing to do with
falling out of love.

36:47.938 --> 36:49.974
<i> We decided together that</i>

36:50.007 --> 36:52.376
<i> we're just probably
 better as friends.</i>

36:55.978 --> 36:58.581
<i> I haven't seen Wilmer
 in over six months.</i>

36:58.614 --> 37:01.818
<i> And when he showed up at
 the Gay Pride party at Mike's</i>

37:01.851 --> 37:03.453
<i> my heart ached.</i>

37:06.356 --> 37:09.893
<i> It's hard enough dealing
 with a breakup...</i>

37:09.925 --> 37:14.364
<i> but, you put it
 in the public eye,</i>

37:14.398 --> 37:15.900
and it feels violating.

37:18.635 --> 37:22.006
<i> I do have moments where...</i>

37:22.039 --> 37:24.041
it's late at night,
and I'm lonely,

37:24.074 --> 37:26.644
and I wonder if...

37:26.677 --> 37:28.879
I made the right decision.

37:28.911 --> 37:30.513
<i> Because love is a gamble.</i>

37:32.882 --> 37:35.885
I don't know if I'll lose him
for the rest of my life.

37:37.853 --> 37:40.056
Wilmer:
Is it this one?

37:40.090 --> 37:42.293
My arm looks so big.

37:42.326 --> 37:43.460
You're flexing.

37:43.492 --> 37:44.795
Hey!

37:44.827 --> 37:46.396
( laughs )
You're so stupid.

37:46.429 --> 37:48.431
I get it.

37:48.465 --> 37:50.601
I get it, that's all I'm saying.

37:50.634 --> 37:52.902
I think my heart's
always with Wilmer.

37:52.936 --> 37:54.672
I think it...

37:54.704 --> 37:57.574
was with Wilmer,
I think that it is with Wilmer,

37:57.606 --> 37:59.509
and I think that it will be.

37:59.543 --> 38:01.010
'Cause you don't share six years
with somebody

38:01.043 --> 38:03.813
and not... give them
a piece of your heart.

38:03.847 --> 38:05.416
<i> And vice versa.</i>

38:05.449 --> 38:06.617
Woman: <i>
 Yeah.</i>

38:06.650 --> 38:08.318
Like, I'm pretty sure

38:08.351 --> 38:10.586
that I'm not gonna meet anybody
that compares to him,

38:10.619 --> 38:12.588
but...

38:12.621 --> 38:14.657
I'm trying to keep an open heart
and an open mind

38:14.690 --> 38:16.359
when it comes to that.

38:16.393 --> 38:19.596
Mike: <i>
 I love Demi and Wilmer
 together.</i>

38:19.628 --> 38:22.965
But I've seen Demi grow a lot

38:22.998 --> 38:26.436
as a person in the last year.

38:26.469 --> 38:29.772
Demi: <i>
 The sparks never faded.</i>

38:29.806 --> 38:32.775
But there are issues that
I haven't conquered yet

38:32.809 --> 38:36.947
<i> that I know I won't conquer
if I'm relying on somebody else</i>

38:36.980 --> 38:39.483
to take care of the loneliness.

38:39.516 --> 38:42.086
Where there is a will,
there's a way, yeah.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.687
No, where there's a...

38:43.719 --> 38:46.789
Both:
Wilmer, there's a way.

38:46.822 --> 38:48.725
<i> I just wasn't ready</i>

38:48.759 --> 38:50.793
and I-- there was so much
of my life

38:50.827 --> 38:52.496
that I hadn't explored yet.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.800
<i> ( music playing )</i>

38:56.833 --> 38:58.869
I wanted a house now

38:58.902 --> 39:01.905
because I'm on my own,

39:01.938 --> 39:04.541
and I'm independent now.

39:07.010 --> 39:10.514
This is the first time Demi's
ever really been on her own

39:10.547 --> 39:12.782
in her life.

39:12.815 --> 39:14.751
<i> It also falls at a time,</i>

39:14.784 --> 39:16.819
<i> as she's turning 25,</i>

39:16.853 --> 39:20.657
<i> where she's trying to
 figure out who she is.</i>

39:20.690 --> 39:22.793
<i> And so I think that
 she's taking the time</i>

39:22.826 --> 39:24.594
<i> to put that into her art</i>

39:24.628 --> 39:27.932
in probably the most meaningful
way she's ever done.

39:29.733 --> 39:31.969
<i> I'm growing up by myself,</i>

39:32.001 --> 39:35.972
and... to have my own place,

39:36.005 --> 39:38.641
designed the way
that I want it to look,

39:38.675 --> 39:39.777
<i> with my dog.</i>

39:39.809 --> 39:41.577
( babbling )

39:41.610 --> 39:44.547
<i> I wanted to know what
 it's like to be on my own.</i>

39:44.581 --> 39:48.852
<i> And this is where I finally
 feel like I can be...</i>

39:48.885 --> 39:50.653
grown up.

41:03.092 --> 41:04.927

41:04.960 --> 41:07.029
That's something that
I'm very proud of.

41:07.063 --> 41:11.568
<i> I'm coming up on five
 and a half years of sobriety,</i>

41:11.601 --> 41:15.771
<i> and that's something that's
 been difficult at times,</i>

41:15.804 --> 41:17.640
but one thing that
I haven't fully conquered

41:17.673 --> 41:18.809
is my eating disorder.

41:24.547 --> 41:25.582
Phil:
You having trouble right now?

41:29.152 --> 41:31.088
What's going on?

41:31.121 --> 41:35.259
It's so weird to talk
about this on camera.

41:35.291 --> 41:40.898
I... relapsed with...
throwing up.

41:42.865 --> 41:44.735
Binging and purging.

41:44.768 --> 41:46.135
When?

41:46.168 --> 41:47.270
A couple nights ago.

41:50.306 --> 41:53.209
<i> The less I have to
 think about food,</i>

41:53.242 --> 41:55.144
the easier it is
for me to go about

41:55.177 --> 41:57.880
<i> having a normal life.</i>

41:57.914 --> 42:01.051
<i> And I don't want to
 let anybody down.</i>

42:01.083 --> 42:02.719
So when I do have moments
where I slip up...

42:04.286 --> 42:07.323
I feel very ashamed.

42:07.356 --> 42:09.759
<i> What started the relapse</i>

42:09.793 --> 42:11.996
was missing Wilmer.

42:14.063 --> 42:17.333
This is the longest you've gone
without being in a relationship.

42:17.367 --> 42:19.903
You're not the only one
to have been through

42:19.936 --> 42:22.338
a six-year relationship,
and break up, and question it,

42:22.371 --> 42:24.273
and then not know
how to be alone.

42:24.306 --> 42:26.576
Well, like,
that's one of the reasons why

42:26.610 --> 42:28.345
we broke up,

42:28.378 --> 42:31.148
was 'cause I've never
been alone.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.349
<i> When I was in a relationship
 with Wilmer,</i>

42:33.382 --> 42:36.586
I went three years
without purging.

42:36.619 --> 42:38.654
And when we broke up,

42:38.688 --> 42:41.925
that's one of
the first things I did.

42:41.958 --> 42:43.594
And when I...

42:43.626 --> 42:46.195
feel lonely...

42:46.228 --> 42:47.931
like, my heart feels hungry.

42:47.963 --> 42:49.032
Phil:
Right.

42:49.065 --> 42:50.701
And then I end up binging.

42:52.235 --> 42:54.905
And I don't know
how to figure out...

42:54.938 --> 42:56.307
how to be alone.

43:00.043 --> 43:03.814
What do you think came first
for you in terms of chasing
the high?

43:03.847 --> 43:06.083
Was it the drugs and alcohol
or was it the food?

43:06.115 --> 43:08.085
The food came first.

43:08.117 --> 43:09.619
<i> When I was about
 eight years old</i>

43:09.652 --> 43:11.253
<i> and my little sister was born,</i>

43:11.286 --> 43:13.122
<i> a lot of the attention
 was taken off of me</i>

43:13.155 --> 43:14.657
and onto my little sister.

43:16.726 --> 43:19.061
<i> I had started working
 at that time,</i>

43:19.094 --> 43:21.197
<i>so I was under a lot of stress.</i>

43:21.231 --> 43:24.635
So I would bake cookies
for my family

43:24.668 --> 43:28.172
and I would eat all of them, and
nobody would have any to eat.

43:30.106 --> 43:33.810
<i> That was my first memory
 of food</i>

43:33.842 --> 43:37.714
being... that medicine for me.

43:40.115 --> 43:43.420
<i> When I was 12,</i>

43:43.452 --> 43:45.188
<i> I was bullied.</i>

43:45.221 --> 43:50.027
I... developed a social anxiety

43:50.059 --> 43:53.230
where I didn't trust
other girls my age.

43:53.262 --> 43:58.701
<i> Then, one day, this girl
 who was popular</i>

43:58.735 --> 44:01.938
<i> started saying,
 "Demi should kill herself.</i>

44:01.971 --> 44:04.840
She should slit her wrists."

44:04.873 --> 44:09.245
<i> And it resulted in
 a suicide petition</i>

44:09.278 --> 44:12.715
that got passed around.

44:12.748 --> 44:17.053
And she had other
classmates sign it.

44:17.086 --> 44:20.257
I mean, there was this
core group of girls

44:20.289 --> 44:24.094
who were, honestly, in my eyes,
pure ( bleep ) evil.

44:25.728 --> 44:28.297
Demi: <i>
 And, when I asked them why,</i>

44:28.331 --> 44:30.099
<i> nobody could give me
 a specific reason</i>

44:30.132 --> 44:32.201
why they were treating me
the way they were.

44:33.936 --> 44:35.938
<i> I had no friends,</i>

44:35.972 --> 44:38.375
<i> I was alone.</i>

44:38.407 --> 44:40.911
So I went off of
what they were calling me,

44:40.943 --> 44:45.882
which was a whore and being fat.

44:45.914 --> 44:48.217
<i> I called my mom on my cell
 phone and I said, "I'm done,</i>

44:48.251 --> 44:49.987
<i> I can't do this anymore,
 pick me up.</i>

44:52.222 --> 44:54.091
She picked me up from school

44:54.123 --> 44:56.292
and that's when my eating
disorder developed.

44:58.862 --> 45:00.463
<i> One day,</i>

45:00.496 --> 45:04.300
I found a copy of her diary.

45:04.333 --> 45:08.504
<i> Demi had drawn a picture of
 what she perceived herself</i>

45:08.538 --> 45:10.306
to look like.

45:12.074 --> 45:13.843
"Heavy."

45:13.876 --> 45:15.911
And then she drew a picture
on the next page,

45:15.945 --> 45:19.316
and said, "This is what
I need to look like

45:19.349 --> 45:21.284
<i> to be...</i>

45:21.317 --> 45:23.019
a star."

45:23.052 --> 45:26.990
This was, like,
a collage that I made

45:27.023 --> 45:30.026
when I was younger.

45:30.059 --> 45:32.028
And it's actually kind of sad
for me because

45:32.061 --> 45:36.133
a lot of the people in here
are underweight and...

45:36.166 --> 45:38.535
I wanted to be so much...

45:38.568 --> 45:41.338
I wanted to be like them.

45:41.371 --> 45:44.840
<i> That was kind of the chic look
 back then.</i>

45:44.873 --> 45:47.409
Yeah, I've got Amy Winehouse
in there that I looked up to

45:47.443 --> 45:49.413
and I wanted to be so badly.

45:52.114 --> 45:54.850
<i> I wanted to be as thin as her,
 I wanted to sing like her,</i>

45:54.884 --> 45:57.086
I wanted to be just like her.

45:59.121 --> 46:02.158
<i> The collages on her wall,
 and the pictures,</i>

46:02.192 --> 46:03.492
and the models,

46:03.525 --> 46:05.861
<i> this isn't what you need to</i>

46:05.894 --> 46:08.264
<i> aspire to be like,
 this is not healthy.</i>

46:08.297 --> 46:10.399
I never thought to say
those things to her

46:10.432 --> 46:13.135
because I didn't know myself.

46:13.168 --> 46:15.237
<i> My desire for perfection,</i>

46:15.271 --> 46:16.539
I think I've always
been that way.

46:16.572 --> 46:20.342
<i> But I felt I had to be thin</i>

46:20.376 --> 46:22.512
<i> to be beautiful,
 and successful,</i>

46:22.545 --> 46:25.282
<i> and that this is what you
 need to look like</i>

46:25.315 --> 46:28.083
<i> in order to be perfect.</i>

46:28.117 --> 46:31.054
I may have passed that
along to my kids,

46:31.086 --> 46:33.556
<i> that wanting everything
 to be perfect,</i>

46:33.590 --> 46:36.526
<i> and need to be</i>

46:36.559 --> 46:39.863
thin and beautiful
to be successful.

46:39.896 --> 46:42.332
Demi: <i>
 Food is still the biggest
 challenge in my life</i>

46:42.364 --> 46:45.968
and it controls...

46:46.001 --> 46:47.503
I don't want to give it
the power to say that

46:47.536 --> 46:50.039
it controls my every thought,

46:50.072 --> 46:54.476
<i> but... it's something that
 I'm constantly thinking about.</i>

46:54.510 --> 46:58.348
<i> Body image,
 what I'm gonna eat next,</i>

46:58.380 --> 47:00.951
<i> what I wish I could be eating,</i>

47:00.983 --> 47:02.918
what I wish I didn't eat.

47:02.952 --> 47:04.287
You know, it's just constant.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.556
It's exhausting.

47:06.588 --> 47:08.391
<i> Like, I get envious towards</i>

47:08.423 --> 47:13.329
<i> people that don't struggle
 with an eating disorder</i>

47:13.362 --> 47:14.364
<i> just because I feel like</i>

47:14.396 --> 47:18.235
my life would be so much easier.

47:18.268 --> 47:20.336
<i> Everybody has their own path
 in recovery.</i>

47:20.369 --> 47:23.072
<i> For me, it's about going to
 therapy, working my program</i>

47:23.106 --> 47:25.375
<i> and having an honest
 relationship with myself</i>

47:25.407 --> 47:27.143
<i>and the other people around me.</i>

47:27.175 --> 47:31.514
I had come across Jay Glazer
and Unbreakable Gym.

47:31.547 --> 47:35.952
<i> And I felt like it would be
 great for her.</i>

47:35.985 --> 47:39.256
Because Demi had just broken up
with Wilmer

47:39.289 --> 47:41.925
<i> and she didn't have
 a lot of friendships,</i>

47:41.958 --> 47:44.059
<i> she didn't have a community.</i>

47:44.092 --> 47:45.661
The workout before that
was super tough.

47:45.695 --> 47:48.064
- Yeah.
- You hear a girl crying,
  it's me.

47:48.097 --> 47:49.233
( laughs )
Okay.

47:50.465 --> 47:53.168
<i> The gym really helps.</i>

47:53.202 --> 47:56.373
<i> And I know that I...</i>

47:56.405 --> 47:58.375
would be in a very dark place
without it.

48:01.710 --> 48:04.146
When you're getting one,
I'm coming right back.

48:04.179 --> 48:06.181
- Come on. Nice, that's it.
- ( grunting )

48:06.215 --> 48:09.619
Good, good, good.
Where's your kick? There it is.

48:09.652 --> 48:11.454
Demi: <i>
 You know it's Monday when
 you get punched in the face</i>

48:11.487 --> 48:14.190
<i> by Randy Couture.</i>

48:14.222 --> 48:15.659
Randy Couture?

48:15.692 --> 48:19.695
Only, like, MMA legend.

48:19.728 --> 48:22.598
<i> ( music playing )</i>

48:22.632 --> 48:25.501
Mike: <i>
 At the time she loved
 kickboxing.</i>

48:25.534 --> 48:27.503
<i> And I was really hoping
 that she would</i>

48:27.536 --> 48:29.172
fall in love with jiu-jitsu.

48:33.608 --> 48:35.011
Insist.

48:38.181 --> 48:41.117
Mike: <i>
 It would give her some pride
 in having her own thing.</i>

48:41.150 --> 48:42.652
It's empowering.

48:42.684 --> 48:44.922
And I watch her light up.

48:46.356 --> 48:48.291
Mike: <i>
 It's a physical chess game.</i>

48:48.324 --> 48:49.459
It makes her think.

48:49.492 --> 48:51.260
Demi: <i>
 Any time I'm able to</i>

48:51.293 --> 48:52.996
<i> take my mind off of...</i>

48:53.028 --> 48:55.130
any of my addictions, um,

48:55.164 --> 48:57.467
it's very beneficial to me.

48:57.500 --> 49:01.137
<i> Because you're constantly
 thinking about...</i>

49:01.170 --> 49:04.240
<i> what the next move is.</i>

49:04.273 --> 49:06.409
<i> The technique,</i>

49:06.442 --> 49:08.077
<i> the strategy,</i>

49:08.110 --> 49:10.547
And also,
there's a reward system

49:10.579 --> 49:13.717
<i> that takes many, many, many
 years to get through.</i>

49:13.750 --> 49:15.085
Excellent.

49:15.117 --> 49:16.418
Back up.

49:16.452 --> 49:18.054
In jiu-jitsu, we start
with a white belt.

49:18.086 --> 49:20.422
<i>Every time you get a promotion,
 it's a stripe.</i>

49:20.456 --> 49:22.057
We do four stripes on each belt,

49:22.090 --> 49:24.027
and then we move
to the next belt.

49:24.059 --> 49:25.695
<i>One goal that I haven't reached
 is a black belt.</i>

49:25.728 --> 49:27.630
Being able to work towards that

49:27.663 --> 49:31.034
<i> is something that
 I'm passionate about.</i>

49:31.067 --> 49:35.137
And I hope to God to see her
into her 30s and to...

49:38.673 --> 49:40.978
( voice breaking ):
...put a black belt
around her waist one day.

49:43.079 --> 49:44.414
Good job.

49:44.447 --> 49:45.548
( exhales )

49:45.581 --> 49:48.151
- Get a drink.
- Okay.

49:48.184 --> 49:50.487
<i> Working out is a form
 of meditation to me</i>

49:50.519 --> 49:53.690
<i> because I'm not focused on
 anything in my head.</i>

49:53.722 --> 49:55.557
<i> It can transport you to</i>

49:55.590 --> 49:57.594
<i> a totally different place.</i>

49:57.626 --> 50:00.230
<i> ( music playing )</i>

50:10.338 --> 50:12.808
<i> I'm on a journey to discover</i>

50:12.842 --> 50:15.612
<i> what it's like to be
 free of all demons.</i>

50:37.233 --> 50:38.635
Man:
Her first stripe on a belt.

50:40.536 --> 50:42.105
Demi, before,
you couldn't talk about weight.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.445
<i> We literally couldn't use
 the term "working out."</i>

50:48.478 --> 50:51.748
<i> And... now...</i>

50:51.780 --> 50:53.049
<i> she loves it.</i>

50:55.217 --> 50:56.752
I, like, don't want to know

50:56.786 --> 50:59.088
what it's like to get really
punched in the face by...

50:59.121 --> 51:02.192
By Randy Couture?
Man, it's like playing
basketball with Michael Jordan.

51:02.224 --> 51:03.492
( static )

51:03.525 --> 51:05.127
All of my bags.

51:07.295 --> 51:08.731
And now my vanity.

51:11.634 --> 51:13.735
Feeling my extensions.

51:13.768 --> 51:16.305
Kelsey Kershner:
Hey, Demitria, can you come here
and approve these TV spots?

51:16.338 --> 51:17.239
Demi:
Yup.

51:21.309 --> 51:24.413
It was an exhausting night
as an assistant.

51:24.447 --> 51:26.782
- It was mid-summer.
- ( woman chuckles )

51:26.815 --> 51:28.518
Producer:
Which night was this, though,
what are we describing here?

51:28.550 --> 51:31.320
Uh, it was Anaheim.
( chuckles )

51:31.353 --> 51:34.756
Um... there were four suitors
in the crowd.

51:34.789 --> 51:37.559
( laughter )

51:37.592 --> 51:40.896
All in separate places
throughout the crowd.

51:40.929 --> 51:43.298
Which I strategically placed.

51:43.331 --> 51:46.235
Again, hard assistant work.
( laughs )

51:46.268 --> 51:48.337
They all wanted to visit her
in the dressing room.

51:48.371 --> 51:50.539
All at different times,
obviously,

51:50.572 --> 51:53.375
so we had to,
you know, coordinate,

51:53.409 --> 51:54.811
make sure some came
before the show,

51:54.844 --> 51:56.612
some came after the show.

51:56.646 --> 51:58.581
( laughing ):
So they didn't
run into each other.

51:58.614 --> 52:01.284
Luckily, all went well.

52:01.317 --> 52:04.219
I feel like it wasn't four,
I feel like it was only two.

52:04.253 --> 52:06.456
It was...

52:06.489 --> 52:11.161
it was N, and then L,
but they had guests,

52:11.193 --> 52:13.496
and then there was...

52:13.528 --> 52:15.565
Was there an O?

52:15.597 --> 52:17.699
- No.
- No, it wasn't that night.

52:17.733 --> 52:20.336
( laughter )

52:21.836 --> 52:23.672
My theory is,

52:23.706 --> 52:25.807
you can't win
if you don't play the game.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.509
( laughter )

52:27.543 --> 52:29.179
( static )

52:29.211 --> 52:31.480
I matched with somebody
on Raya just now.

52:31.514 --> 52:33.583
You did?
Can I see?

52:33.615 --> 52:36.853
I am on the dating app
with both guys and girls.

52:36.885 --> 52:40.523
I am open to human connection.

52:40.556 --> 52:42.858
So whether that's through
a male or a female,

52:42.891 --> 52:44.426
it doesn't matter to me.

52:44.460 --> 52:45.695
Avo Yermagyan:
She is so cute.

52:45.728 --> 52:47.363
Mm-hmm.

52:47.396 --> 52:50.365
Liking somebody and then...

52:50.398 --> 52:54.336
like, them texting you and...

52:54.369 --> 52:57.239
you waiting for their text back,

52:57.273 --> 52:59.909
and them liking your picture
on Instagram,

52:59.942 --> 53:01.344
um, all these, like, feels--

53:01.376 --> 53:04.213
and first dates, oh, my God.

53:04.246 --> 53:05.949
I need looks for this weekend.

53:05.981 --> 53:07.583
You do? Date night?

53:07.617 --> 53:10.486
How many? Is there a story?
Is there a theme?

53:10.518 --> 53:11.954
I'm going to a soccer game.

53:11.987 --> 53:13.889
Jumpsuit, dress...?

53:13.922 --> 53:16.258
Jumpsuit.

53:16.291 --> 53:17.460
Cleavage?

53:17.492 --> 53:18.728
Always.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.898
First dates are...
so nerve-racking.

53:21.931 --> 53:24.867
I didn't have that before.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.668
I mean, not in so long,

53:26.702 --> 53:28.871
and... the butterflies of that,

53:28.903 --> 53:30.873
the sweat on my hands,

53:30.905 --> 53:33.409
the ( bleep ) sweaty palms,

53:33.442 --> 53:37.413
like, all that is fun,
it's so much fun.

53:37.445 --> 53:38.947
This is like
a close-the-deal dress,

53:38.981 --> 53:40.917
do you want to close the deal?

53:40.949 --> 53:42.484
- Hell yeah,
  I want to close the deal.
- Okay.

53:42.518 --> 53:43.885
'Cause you're in
escrow right now.

53:43.918 --> 53:45.887
( laughs )

53:45.920 --> 53:47.322
I thought you said,
"You're an escort."

53:47.356 --> 53:48.458
No.
( laughs )

53:48.490 --> 53:49.492
Don't you think?

53:49.525 --> 53:50.927
Should we try a new deal?

53:50.960 --> 53:53.295
- No, we don't need to do that.
- Yeah, no, okay.

53:53.329 --> 53:55.565
And, I think, don't tape it down

53:55.597 --> 53:57.532
because, like,
feeling that danger,

53:57.565 --> 53:59.268
like, is sexier to do.

53:59.302 --> 54:00.870
Okay, cool. And then...

54:00.902 --> 54:02.971
- Do I let the nipples show?
- Let the nipples show.

54:03.005 --> 54:04.773
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:04.806 --> 54:07.476
Yeah.

54:07.510 --> 54:08.745
It's, like, really see-through.

54:08.777 --> 54:10.045
It's the female bulge.

54:10.079 --> 54:12.015
It's like letting
the guy know who's boss.

54:12.047 --> 54:14.750
- I don't know if I can do that.
- Do it.

54:14.784 --> 54:16.986
When I'm comfortable
in my own skin,

54:17.018 --> 54:18.520
I feel confident.

54:18.554 --> 54:19.922
And when I feel confident,

54:19.954 --> 54:21.391
