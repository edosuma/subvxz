00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
A feature of the KonMari Method

00:45.336 --> 00:48.214
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:51.718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.462
I am Margie Hodges,

02:51.796 --> 02:53.673
Margaret when my mom is mad at me.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.800
I live in Culver City, California.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.345
My home has a lot of personal effects,

02:59.429 --> 03:02.724
it has a lot of memories,
it has a lot of photographs, um,

03:02.807 --> 03:04.601
mementos from traveling,

03:04.684 --> 03:06.811
you know, I just like a place that just

03:06.895 --> 03:08.855
anybody can come in,
and feel like they're at home.

03:08.938 --> 03:12.400
I had two little toddlers when we moved
into this particular house,

03:12.483 --> 03:14.444
and then had another child afterwards,

03:14.903 --> 03:17.572
so, yeah, almost 30 years in,
in this house.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.248
So, my salt and pepper's here,
cumin,

03:27.332 --> 03:29.083
-put a little coriander, whatever.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.376
Onions are, like...

03:32.170 --> 03:34.380
Lu, a little, a little cilantro.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.299
I thought you didn't
even like cilantro.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.884
- It's okay.
-It'll shrink down.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.052
- Okay.
- Hello.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.222
- Hey, Jake man, how was school?
-Good. What's up?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.057
- Hi.
-Hi.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.267
-We're gonna make you a healthy dinner.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.020
-You're not used that that, huh?
-Do you wanna put some of this in?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.647
Yeah, that's-- Leave that.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.107
-That one's open, I think it's fine.
-The secret ingredient.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.236
Just shake it up so it's...
I do have a lot of stuff, guys.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.280
You never know what kid's gonna come over
to borrow something.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.658
Already.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.868
Oh, I found some stuff.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.869
Let me show you.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.497
I wanted to show you
some pictures I found.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.085
I'm proud of my home.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.170
You know,
it saw us through some good times

04:14.254 --> 04:16.839
and then it saw us through
some really dark times towards the end,

04:16.923 --> 04:18.258
when my husband got sick.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.885
It changed... just everything.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.263
I wish you guys could meet my husband.
He's...

04:24.222 --> 04:26.599
<i>Life of the party, larger than life,</i>

04:26.683 --> 04:29.560
<i>physically, and just his personality.</i>

04:29.644 --> 04:32.939
<i>He just was the guy everybody flocked to.</i>

04:33.022 --> 04:35.650
<i>And he took good care of me</i>
<i>and he taught us all a lot</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:41.906
about life, about what matters in life,

04:42.156 --> 04:44.867
and, you know, how to enjoy...
enjoy yourself.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.496
<i>Was this his stuff or...?</i>

04:48.579 --> 04:51.582
This is his stuff. These are--
Some of the stuff is stuff we gave him.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.002
- Oh, oh.
- Look what I found!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.044
Oh, my God.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.504
- What?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.839
I can't...

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
Who's that?

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
-Ah, jeez.
-You guys are adorable.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.888
<i>Now my husband's gone,</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:08.850
<i>I've got an empty house full of stuff.</i>

05:09.058 --> 05:11.394
<i>Rick has monumental amount of stuff</i>

05:11.477 --> 05:14.772
<i>that has accumulated from prior business</i>
<i>to present business</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:16.482
<i>to inventions.</i>

05:16.566 --> 05:19.027
<i>Any kind of creative ideas</i>
<i>he might have had.</i>

05:19.110 --> 05:20.778
<i>It's so personal to him.</i>

05:20.862 --> 05:23.656
I'm very strong-willed
and have good ideas,

05:23.740 --> 05:25.658
but I don't know that I have

05:26.075 --> 05:28.828
everything it takes, you know, er,

05:28.953 --> 05:32.206
or just the fortitude it takes
to get rid of his belongings.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.833
<i>But I'm alone now.</i>

05:34.250 --> 05:36.961
<i>I lost my husband,</i>
<i>my kids all have moved out,</i>

05:37.086 --> 05:40.381
<i>so,</i> <i>this is the perfect time for me</i>
<i>to make room for,</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:42.550
<i>you know, whatever is next.</i>

05:42.925 --> 05:46.471
<i>So, um, when Marie comes,</i>
<i>she's gonna kinda just get me started,</i>

05:46.554 --> 05:49.474
<i>but she's not gonna be here,</i>
<i>this is gonna be my full-time job,</i>

05:49.557 --> 05:50.683
<i>just cleaning my house.</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:51.601
Well, good.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.313
It's a little daunting when you see
how much stuff we've accumulated.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.774
I hope that Marie can help find

05:57.857 --> 06:01.152
the same calmness and coziness

06:01.235 --> 06:02.695
that I like in my house,

06:02.779 --> 06:05.782
but maybe not
with all these things everywhere.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.117
Mom, are you ready to eat?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.662
-I'll sit here. You sit at the head, Mom.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.916
Oh, yeah, that's her chair.
It's been so long since a family dinner.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.209
Well, it's kinda-- Yeah.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.920
It is kinda weird
'cause we're missing several, so...

06:20.213 --> 06:22.840
-Okay, guys.
-Good luck with your new adventure.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.717
Cheers to new beginnings.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.260
Starting fresh.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.221
Mmm, do I have your support, guys?

06:28.304 --> 06:31.307
I-I-I hope you know
how much this means to me.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.517
Mm-hmm.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.354
You know, it's a lot of--
it's a lot of life in this house,

06:36.437 --> 06:38.981
and I don't wanna just, you know, dump it.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.901
-Yeah.
-I wanna to be thoughtful about it

06:41.984 --> 06:43.986
and I don't want to get rid of...

06:44.278 --> 06:46.489
important things or things that you wish--

06:46.572 --> 06:48.741
oh, man,
we shouldn't have got rid of, so...

06:48.825 --> 06:50.618
kinda, like, I need you to speak up

06:50.701 --> 06:53.371
and kinda be here as I go through this.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
- It's kind of emotional.
-Yeah.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.167
I've been so strong, and it's, like,
this is really real now.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.796
It's been a rough year,
but this is gonna be a good cleansing.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.589
Okay, guys, so...

07:04.966 --> 07:06.551
Lu, you do it.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.845
Dear Lord, thank you for this meal
and that we can all be together

07:11.180 --> 07:14.475
and please watch over us, and...

07:14.559 --> 07:16.144
we're here for my mom

07:16.227 --> 07:19.397
on this next chapter
and journey in her life.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.691
In Jesus' name, amen.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.942
- Amen.
-Amen.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.777
<i>By tidying,</i>

07:24.861 --> 07:27.280
you can sometimes ease
the pain of the past.

07:27.363 --> 07:31.909
Or even start thinking about your future
in a more positive way.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.412
Once we are done,

07:34.495 --> 07:37.290
I have every faith that Margie's life

07:37.373 --> 07:39.750
will spark with even more joy.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.315
This house is so cute.
This is the house, right?

08:13.451 --> 08:15.495
- Hi!
-Hello, Marie.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.121
Hello, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.833
Thank you for coming all the way
to my house.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.293
Thank you for inviting me.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.295
-I'm so excited for you to be here.
- Yeah.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.633
So beautiful.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.010
-Thank you. You wanna ride my pony?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.138
-Can I ride?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.683
Wow.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.268
Only because she's little.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.899
-This is just decoration?
- Yeah, decoration.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.943
-Yeah.
-Okay. Oh, it's so cute.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.027
Yeah.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.113
It's the first time I've seen that.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.365
Wow.

08:52.448 --> 08:56.202
I've got lots of fun things in my house,
lots of special things.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.703
-Wow.
-Yeah, so...

08:57.787 --> 08:59.080
I'm so happy to be here,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.708
so I'd love it
if you could give me a tour.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.503
-Sure. Not as happy as I am to have you.
-Yeah.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.587
So come on in.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.466
I can take you back into the,
the abandoned bedrooms from my children.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.098
That, That is the nervous cat.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.183
-I have two, two cats.
-Two cats, okay.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.644
-The other one is okay, this one, nervous.
-Nervous, okay.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.354
I'm sorry.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.815
-So...
-Yeah.

09:25.898 --> 09:30.069
My children are big and gone,
but we have lots of stuff left.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.862
-So--
-How many children?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.197
-I have three.
-Three, yeah.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.658
And we keep talking about,
"We need to do this,"

09:35.741 --> 09:37.577
and, "I'm too busy, Mom,"

09:37.660 --> 09:41.414
so, for now, we just put it in here,
and close the door.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.999
This is the dining room.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.292
Yeah, yeah.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.127
It looks so tidy.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.338
My house is clean, it's just every drawer,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.591
every closet is packed.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.803
-Oh, what this? How this?
-Well...

09:55.886 --> 09:56.971
-It's a drawer?

09:57.054 --> 09:58.389
This is a catchall.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.766
Anything you don't know where to put,
you put it in here.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.311
Ah, okay.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.105
She looks excited.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.399
-Yeah, yeah.

10:08.482 --> 10:13.195
I am so excited because I like tidying
and I love mess.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.573
Oh. Well, you came to the right house.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.490
Yeah.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.242
And this is my kitchen,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.244
- I live here alone.
- Yeah.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.621
Look at all my stuff.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.331
More stuff!

10:25.708 --> 10:27.501
Oh!

10:27.710 --> 10:30.171
-I see.

10:30.254 --> 10:34.133
My husband loved condiments
and spices and sauces.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.055
And this is what
my husband said to me every morning.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
He called me Mag and he would always say,

10:41.432 --> 10:43.309
"Good coffee, Mag!"

10:43.684 --> 10:45.811
Okay, what do you wanna come see?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.063
-Bedroom number two?
-Yes.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.899
I think this is Lucy's stuff.
From when she was little.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.275
- Yeah.
-From school.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.903
And then, also I have up here.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.155
-I haven't been up there in many years.
- Yeah.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.908
-So, I have a very big bedroom.
-Yeah.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.494
This is all my husband's
and then this is all mine.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.288
His things are still in the drawers
and then me.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.040
- Oh...

11:06.123 --> 11:07.333
Too much stuff.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.961
What about these shelves here?
-All kinds-- All kinds of things.
-Clothes, too?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.007
-No, purses.
- Ah, purse.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.344
Sometimes I put--
I buy little things, like gifts,

11:18.427 --> 11:21.263
and I just stick it up here. More candy.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.266
- Candy.
-Yeah, but I don't go up here too much.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.103
-Ah.
-This is where he had all his pants,

11:27.186 --> 11:29.522
so I have them,
I have them, um, down there.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.481
Yeah, yeah.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.525
There's the, the jeans.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.151
- Yeah, yeah.
-See, see how big?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.904
The pants are so big. This is so many...

11:36.987 --> 11:38.322
so many pairs.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.782
-Yeah.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.993
And then we spend a lot of time--
This is our family room.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.912
Oh, wow.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.083
-So cool.
-Yeah.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.419
There's a very good energy.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.462
This is all of your books?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.673
-Or the--
-I have more.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.676
-Some of them.
-Yeah, some of them.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.595
Some are my husband's.
My husband saved everything.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.725
So, when did your husband pass away?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.226
-Nine months ago.
-Nine months ago.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.978
-Last summer, last June.
-Yeah.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.522
I have to make room going forward.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.024
-I can't just only live in the past.
-Yeah.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.697
So, yes, I think you will find
that this opportunity

12:19.780 --> 12:23.367
for us to work together is really a time
for you to reflect upon your life

12:23.451 --> 12:25.369
and start tidying
and organizing your life.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.581
-I want to keep lots of memories still.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.585
But I would like to value
how you feel

12:32.668 --> 12:34.837
about your past and your memories.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.714
Of course. Thank you, thank you.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.178
Well, I'm thanking you for sitting down
and not running out the front door

12:42.261 --> 12:43.804
going, "Ah! This is too much!"

12:46.015 --> 12:49.643
So, this is where we begin,
where we start our tidying process.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.938
I'm ready.
I have really kind of stated to everybody,

12:53.022 --> 12:56.484
this year, for me,
is my year to tidy up my whole life.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.528
So, I've been through an awful lot
and I'm...

13:00.279 --> 13:04.784
I've learned a lot, I'm amazed
how strong I have been through it all,

13:04.867 --> 13:08.996
and I, I feel like I've got the energy
and the desire to really

13:09.079 --> 13:12.416
prepare for what's to come next,
whatever that might be.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.253
I feel so fortunate to be able
to go on this journey with you.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.589
Thank you. That makes me...

13:18.923 --> 13:20.299
That makes me very happy.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.345
After you finish tidying,
do you have an image

13:24.428 --> 13:26.430
of what kind of life
you would like to lead?

13:26.514 --> 13:29.809
Yeah, I-I would like to travel again,
that's really one of the things
on my list, is to travel,

13:33.270 --> 13:36.273
'cause I, I have relatives in fun places
around the world.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.984
Also, I would like to have
a spare room devoted

13:39.068 --> 13:41.362
as a craft room or, you know,

13:41.445 --> 13:44.990
a place for me just to have
all my supplies,

13:45.074 --> 13:49.286
and in one room,
in one spot, organized neatly.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.457
So, those images
are very, very important,

13:53.541 --> 13:57.336
but the most important step is to have
an image of your ideal lifestyle

13:57.419 --> 13:59.797
that you want to lead
once you've finished tidying.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.173
Clearer the image, the better.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.091
Okay.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.343
Before we start tidying...

14:04.426 --> 14:06.512
I would like to greet your house.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.265
-Okay. How do you do that?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.724
Er, don't worry about me.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.269
-This is just for her.
-Oh, it's-- it's her--

14:13.978 --> 14:14.895
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.857
I find the best place to...

14:28.450 --> 14:29.285
Okay.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.245
Ah, this is okay.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.617
Thank you so much.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.414
I will tell you,
the feeling in this house is spectacular.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.542
So, what I'd like for you to remember
as you go through this process

15:18.626 --> 15:21.921
is that you're not alone,
the house itself and all your belongings

15:22.004 --> 15:24.256
are there to support you and are with you.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.300
Yes, they are.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.802
- Let's start tidying.

15:33.057 --> 15:37.770
All of your clothes
and put them in a pile on your bed.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.731
- <i>Take out all of your clothes</i>
<i>and make a mountain on your bed.</i>

15:40.814 --> 15:42.775
Okay. This is hard to do.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.860
Yeah. Is this yours or...?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.528
-That's Rick's.
-Okay.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.447
-Just yours this time.
-Yeah.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.824
-This end we leave for now.
-Yeah.

15:50.908 --> 15:51.784
And this...

15:51.867 --> 15:56.205
I always recommend that clients wait

15:56.288 --> 15:58.874
to tidy belongings of a loved one
until the end.

15:58.958 --> 16:03.921
The reason is because
tidying those items is very difficult.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.882
<i>So there is a high chance</i>
<i>that it will stall the tidying process.</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:11.804
Gonna make a mountain.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.518
Thank you.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.104
It looks different when you see it
thrown on your bed like that.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.230
I know.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.402
-Oh, this is mortifying.
- Yeah.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.528
Oh, my God.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.280
It's gonna be up to the ceiling,
I have a feeling. Oh.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.533
-Wait,  ...you need to...
-Yeah!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.953
-That was a workout, look at this.
-Yes.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.746
-Look at it, it's just...

16:37.830 --> 16:40.708
- So, this is the start.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.293
Hold each item one by one

16:43.377 --> 16:48.215
and choose item that spark a joy for you.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.175
Um...

16:51.343 --> 16:53.554
I just...

16:54.555 --> 16:57.683
Oh, my God! That's all I keep saying.

16:57.766 --> 17:01.061
So, you'll be able to be more attuned
to what sparks joy for you

17:01.145 --> 17:03.605
if you start with something
that you obviously like

17:03.689 --> 17:04.898
and you wear all the time,

17:04.982 --> 17:07.067
you're just 100% sure
it sparks joy for you.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.448
My two robes, my three robes.
These couple of things I wear a lot.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.826
This has sparked joy for you.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.245
-Yeah, those are my cozies.
-Okay.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.374
This one, I-I have had this
since I was nursing babies.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.626
My youngest is almost 26.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.963
But it's okay, I can say goodbye.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.549
If you are letting go
of an item

17:30.632 --> 17:32.301
that you have a lot of memories of,

17:32.384 --> 17:34.636
that's when you want to say
thank you from your heart.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.765
I know, thank you, thank you. Lots of--

17:37.848 --> 17:40.684
I can't believe how long this lasted,
so many years.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.144
-But...
- Yes.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.646
...this is-- this chapter is behind me.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.356
-Yeah.
-So, thank you.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.192
I'm just, um...

17:49.109 --> 17:51.320
...feeling a little bit like,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.906
"Wow, this is gonna take me a long time."

17:54.323 --> 17:56.658
<i>I would love to be doing it with Rick,</i>

17:56.742 --> 18:00.954
<i>I mean, there's really nobody else</i>
<i>I could choose to do this with.</i>

18:01.038 --> 18:03.832
<i>He was so capable of so many things,</i>
and now it's kind of like
smacking me in the face with,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.755
"Okay, he's not here.
What are you gonna do now?"

18:11.340 --> 18:12.841
<i>How do you feel now?</i>

18:12.925 --> 18:15.094
It was more than I thought
it was gonna be.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.387
-First of all the amount of stuff.
-Yeah.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.433
But it was easier than I thought
in the sense...

18:21.725 --> 18:23.644
I can do without that, you know?

18:23.727 --> 18:26.855
I've-I've been through
some serious battles lately,

18:26.939 --> 18:30.275
so, making decisions
about clothes is very, um...

18:31.610 --> 18:33.570
Well, quite a bit easier than I thought.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.699
Yeah, I was surprised how smoothly
you made the selection,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.118
so I think it's going very well.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.036
Thank you so much.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.831
-Can I give you a hug?
-Yeah. Thank you, thank you so much.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.851
<i>My life has transformed</i>
<i>just completely, um,</i>

19:03.934 --> 19:05.144
<i>in the last year.</i>

19:05.519 --> 19:08.438
<i>You know, when you choose a person</i>
<i>for 40 years,</i>

19:08.522 --> 19:11.108
<i>you know, you want to be</i>
<i>with that person, and...</i>

19:11.191 --> 19:14.486
it's a big void in the house
and in my life,

19:14.570 --> 19:17.364
and I honestly have never lived alone.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.451
Oh, my God.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.415
<i>I do hope that this will allow me</i>
<i>to have, um,</i>

19:26.498 --> 19:29.418
<i>some thoughts about what can I do,</i>
<i>what do I want to do,</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:32.838
<i>the things that I haven't actually</i>
<i>allowed myself to think.</i>

19:32.921 --> 19:34.840
<i>I want to be able to fantasize about</i>

19:34.923 --> 19:37.259
<i>how do I wanna decorate the bedroom,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:41.346
<i>Or how would I redo this</i>
<i>and I have a hard time making decisions.</i>

19:41.430 --> 19:44.933
<i>But, um, it's all on me now,</i>
<i>I don't have to run it by anybody.</i>

19:45.017 --> 19:47.895
And that's an experience, I guess,
I have never had before,

19:47.978 --> 19:50.772
where it's just solely me
making my decisions.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.378
- Hi!
-Good morning!

20:13.462 --> 20:15.797
-Good morning. Nice to see you.
-Hello.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.049
Hello.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.634
-Welcome back.
-Yeah.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.845
-Come on in. Hi, Iida.
-Good to see you again.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.597
-Thank you.
-Welcome, welcome.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.640
Yeah.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.642
Has it been a week?

20:28.018 --> 20:29.978
You want to come see
what I've been up to?

20:30.062 --> 20:30.979
Yeah.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.857
This is what I'm getting rid of.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.403
Look at all those bags.
Those are all gonna go, yeah.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.614
-And all these purses.
- Yeah.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.158
I don't even know
where some of these purses are from,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.328
I don't remember them, they've been
up there so long in my closet.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.956
What I'm wondering is,
what do I do now?

20:49.039 --> 20:51.250
This is all I am keeping from my purses.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.336
Do I need to get a container
to put them into, maybe?

20:54.419 --> 20:56.463
- If you have a container...
-A basket?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.924
...or basket, that would be great.

21:03.804 --> 21:09.351
Many people feel that
there isn't enough space to store bags.

21:09.893 --> 21:14.439
So I suggest the "Bag in Bag" Method.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.964
Okay, so I just have to basically get

21:39.047 --> 21:42.551
started on getting Rick's items
out of the drawers,

21:42.634 --> 21:45.846
so that I have more room to finish
putting my things away, I suppose.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.101
So, what's important
for you to do right now

21:51.184 --> 21:53.812
at this stage is to really
just focus on yourself.

21:53.895 --> 21:57.190
You can set aside Rick's clothes for now,
we'll come back to that.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.775
-Okay.
-We'll take the steps to do that.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.485
I don't want to jump ahead of the process.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.488
I-- I'm learning, so, okay.

22:03.905 --> 22:07.075
I do associate things
with memories for sure.

22:07.159 --> 22:11.371
<i>It's hard to stay on focus 'cause I've got</i>
<i>Rick's items still to be dealt with.</i>

22:12.289 --> 22:14.207
<i>I don't want to constantly</i>
<i>be thinking about that</i>

22:14.291 --> 22:16.001
<i>every time I get dressed in the morning.</i>

22:16.835 --> 22:21.048
<i>I'm definitely anxious,</i>
<i>but I have to trust Marie's process.</i>

22:22.632 --> 22:25.635
-Okay.
- The next on your step is books.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.553
Okay.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.806
With books, we follow
the exact same process as clothes.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.142
We will be gathering all the books
in the house,

22:32.225 --> 22:34.061
and going through them one by one.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.437
Ooh!

22:38.982 --> 22:41.234
I will literally just
stand up here and climb it.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.569
-Okay.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.196
-This is all built in.
-Ah, built in.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.739
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.829
I think these are, um,
Rick's cowboy books.

22:52.913 --> 22:56.166
When we used to go on vacation,
he'd always read an easy cowboy book.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.168
So, do you like to travel?

22:58.418 --> 23:02.589
Yeah, I used to work for the airlines,
so we did a fair amount of traveling.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.757
Yeah, yeah.

23:05.050 --> 23:05.926
That's a keeper.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.351
How do you feel looking at all these--
all the books?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.854
I feel like I'm in
somebody else's library,

23:17.938 --> 23:20.399
...'cause I don't know
what a lot of this stuff is.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.403
So...

23:25.487 --> 23:27.322
So, before I start...

23:27.406 --> 23:28.740
-Gotta wake 'em up?
-Exactly.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.992
-Wake up the piles.
- Before I start tidying books,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.661
I like to wake them up a little bit.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.538
It's a little easier to sort through.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.249
Um, okay...

23:38.458 --> 23:41.753
How do I decide what I want to keep?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.257
It's perfectly natural to feel anxious.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.385
Just start with something easy,
you obviously don't want.

23:48.468 --> 23:52.889
Okay. But I'm-I'm wrestling with
not feeling finished up there.

23:53.473 --> 23:57.227
I feel like I'm jumping
into something else and I'm not done.
I was sort of prepared
to pull all of Rick's things out.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.023
Yeah, yeah.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.860
I-- I mean, it's not gonna be
the easiest thing,

24:04.943 --> 24:06.153
but I'm tough and I'm...

24:06.820 --> 24:08.822
I'm not gonna be tough now.

24:08.905 --> 24:12.784
But I really think
I was mentally preparing for that.

24:13.076 --> 24:17.122
So, I... I sort of feel like
I wanna kind of

24:17.205 --> 24:20.125
finish before I jump into the next thing.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.838
I understand.
Let's shift the rules for you, Margie.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.966
That-That-That I think
that would make me feel comfortable.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.595
I'm so happy that I was able
to understand you a little bit better.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.347
You know, I am here to help you,

24:34.431 --> 24:38.393
so whenever you need help or you're stuck,
call on me and I'll come right over.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.436
Thank you.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.564
Normally when we work
on sentimental items too quickly,

24:42.647 --> 24:44.441
we become stuck,

24:44.900 --> 24:47.611
because our ability to determine...

24:48.361 --> 24:50.655
what sparks joy

24:51.031 --> 24:54.868
has not been sufficiently honed yet.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.704
But this was a very special case,
so I allowed Margie to work...

25:00.999 --> 25:04.211
on some sentimental items first.

25:04.461 --> 25:08.965
I offered to help Margie tidy
Rick's clothing with her,

25:09.049 --> 25:12.677
but she expressed her wishes
to tidy his clothes alone,

25:12.761 --> 25:15.347
so I trusted her to do that on her own.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.891
Okay. Thank you again.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.309
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.686
- Goodbye, see you soon.
-Enjoy the beautiful day.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.146
Okay, bye.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.935
This is kinda hard.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.689
<i>You know, I looked at</i>
<i>those shirts and I thought</i>

26:47.772 --> 26:51.109
<i>of all the hopes and dreams</i>
<i>he had while he...</i>

26:51.318 --> 26:55.447
<i>you know, was in his Hawaiian shirt phase,</i>
<i>and then it went into the cowboy phase.</i>

26:56.656 --> 27:00.201
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>it's just kind of a real jolt</i>

27:00.827 --> 27:03.788
to see all this life, you know,
that we've lived,

27:03.872 --> 27:05.040
and the dreams that he had

27:05.123 --> 27:08.293
and, you know, they are now
in a pile on the floor,

27:08.376 --> 27:10.253
and my closet is empty.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.214
And that,
that was a very big jolt for me today.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.035
It was-- It was a difficult process
for me, I...

27:42.118 --> 27:43.745
More so than I expected.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.414
And seemingly kind of final.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.334
I've been so good throughout this

27:49.417 --> 27:52.295
and I've been looking at it so long
and just wanting it to go away,

27:53.129 --> 27:55.090
but I guess it's just that final...

27:55.715 --> 27:56.675
final chunk of...

27:57.258 --> 27:59.469
you know, what's so visibly him.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.933
<i>Evidently, there's lots of him</i>
<i>in the house and I've got all his...</i>

28:05.392 --> 28:07.977
<i>papers and belongings otherwise,</i>

28:08.061 --> 28:10.772
<i>but, you know, the clothes are</i>
<i>a very physical thing.</i>

28:13.400 --> 28:16.236
<i>His-His presence was so big,</i>
<i>his clothes are so big,</i>

28:16.319 --> 28:18.029
<i>his shoes are so big,</i>

28:18.113 --> 28:22.158
and it's just very noticeable
he's not there.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.165
Okay.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.255
Ah.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.555
- Hi.
- Morning. Hi.

28:43.638 --> 28:44.931
Hi. I'm Margie.

28:45.014 --> 28:49.144
-I have a big donation for you.
-Margie? Thank you. We love it!

28:49.227 --> 28:51.604
-It's amazing what I'm getting rid of.
-Okay.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.273
Clothing? Oh, you've got a lot of things.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.525
-I do, do you have room?
-Perfect, yes.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.069
Absolutely.

29:00.029 --> 29:00.947
<i>I did it.</i>

29:01.239 --> 29:03.032
<i>That truck was packed,</i>

29:03.116 --> 29:06.369
<i>and, um, a lot of life,</i>
<i>a lot of memories and...</i>

29:06.745 --> 29:10.331
You know, and my head is full
of 40 years of memories.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.836
So, I have that, no one can take that.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.591
<i>It's gonna feel good when I drive off,</i>
<i>I'm just... </i>

29:19.966 --> 29:23.178
...a lot-a lot, a lot!
Getting to this point was a lot of work,

29:23.261 --> 29:26.347
it was a lot of memories,
it was a lot of emotions,

29:26.431 --> 29:29.726
and I want to only remember the good.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.159
-Hi, hi, hi. How was your weekend?
- Hey.

29:46.242 --> 29:49.329
Good. I want to see the closet now.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.456
- Oh, You haven't seen it. Okay.
-No.

29:51.539 --> 29:55.168
- Whoa, that's creepy.
-Isn't it?

29:55.460 --> 29:56.961
Hello!

29:57.045 --> 30:00.006
-Aww. That's sad.
-I know.

30:00.089 --> 30:03.134
I know, it's-- it's really impactful
when you see...

30:03.218 --> 30:05.094
-Yeah.
-...all his stuff out of here.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.807
I-I kept one long flannel<i> </i>and his jacket

30:08.890 --> 30:10.475
and I still have some of his boots.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.686
I finally am feeling really different.

30:13.770 --> 30:17.023
I feel proud of myself, you know?

30:17.106 --> 30:19.192
I-I-I always told Rick,
"You're making me lazy,"

30:19.275 --> 30:21.152
because he does things so well,

30:21.236 --> 30:23.404
and does so much that I don't have to.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.949
Not that I couldn't, but I never had to.

30:26.032 --> 30:30.537
And now I enjoy
that I know I can if I need to.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.096
-Hi, hello.
-Hello!

30:48.179 --> 30:49.389
Welcome back, girls!

30:49.472 --> 30:52.642
Hi. Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

30:52.725 --> 30:56.062
Thank you, thank you.
It's like, you know, the weather change.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.438
Yeah, summer.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.566
Yeah. So how's everything?

30:59.649 --> 31:01.484
-Good.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.570
Well, come on in.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.780
The next thing I am thinking

31:05.864 --> 31:09.701
about having you tackle is
the room that used to be your kid's room.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.332
Okay, so this room...

31:18.418 --> 31:22.213
It seems like it's a little more tidy
than the last time I was in here.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.798
Did you go through them all?

31:23.882 --> 31:27.260
Well, I-I have been taking things
and adding things and...

31:27.343 --> 31:31.014
Yeah. I-- Maybe I was trying
to group things, too, maybe a little bit.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.851
Um, just dealing with upstairs
was very emotional for me,

31:35.143 --> 31:38.605
more difficult than I was expecting,
to deal with Rick's stuff.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.858
Regarding the tidying process,

31:41.941 --> 31:44.027
I understand that you've overcome
a very major step.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.697
I'm very proud of Margie
for her accomplishments.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.616
I felt very deeply

31:49.699 --> 31:54.621
what a significant presence
Rick was in Margie's life.

31:54.704 --> 31:58.666
I also felt that she's now ready
to continue tidying,

31:58.750 --> 32:01.377
so I would like to continue
the lesson with her.

32:04.297 --> 32:08.009
Okay, so we're gonna start looking
at miscellaneous items in this room.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.177
-One by one.
-Okay.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.557
The things that you want to keep,
like the scrapbooks, the craft equipment,

32:14.641 --> 32:16.726
all those you want to keep,
keep them confidently.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.020
Okay.  Alright.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.564
This is a treasure hunt in here, girls.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.734
-Do you want these?
-No, no.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.153
I don't know what they are.

32:27.737 --> 32:30.990
You guys have first dibs
on any of my fabulous junk.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.410
Well, for $1.89 instead of $19.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.038
-Ah!
-That's where I get myself in trouble.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.874
I'm ready to run away from home!

32:40.333 --> 32:43.544
This is the worst I've experienced so far.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.588
<i>I'm a closet stasher.</i>

32:45.672 --> 32:47.799
<i>I'm fessing up.</i>

32:47.882 --> 32:50.218
The secret is out and I'm owning it
and I don't want
to feel like this anymore!

32:52.720 --> 32:56.265
-Oh, God. How do I know?
- Yes, you will.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.475
Or do I get rid of it now,

32:57.558 --> 33:00.311
and if I need it again,
I go spend 99 cents and buy a new one?

33:00.395 --> 33:01.521
Well...

33:01.604 --> 33:04.565
I don't know, you guys.
Help me out, help me out, I don't know.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.362
So, if you feel overwhelmed, just...

33:09.779 --> 33:12.156
take a moment to breath in and out.

33:12.240 --> 33:17.036
I know, the decision making is very mental
and it makes you weary.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.417
Okay. So, if you're unsure,
let's keep it for now.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.919
<i>It was a good feeling to know</i>

33:25.003 --> 33:28.464
<i>that Rick's clothes is a closed book now</i>

33:28.548 --> 33:32.010
<i>and I can move forward</i>
<i>with this process, but, um,</i>

33:32.093 --> 33:35.596
<i>I realized soon enough</i>
<i>that I have so much to do,</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:38.599
and to have it all on me

33:38.683 --> 33:40.601
is just-- Aah!

33:40.685 --> 33:42.854
I felt like, "Wow."

33:43.229 --> 33:44.564
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

33:44.647 --> 33:47.358
<i>There's so much to deal with</i>
<i>and so many decisions</i>

33:47.442 --> 33:49.694
<i>and I don't know how I'll get it done.</i>

33:49.777 --> 33:50.611
<i>I really don't.</i>

33:50.695 --> 33:52.280
I gotta figure out a lot of stuff.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.616
-Uh, and there's so, so many.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.710
So, I think going forward, Margie,

34:05.793 --> 34:08.921
your challenge will be
just tackling each item

34:09.005 --> 34:10.882
one by one, calmly,

34:10.965 --> 34:13.009
and you are an expert already

34:13.092 --> 34:15.762
at identifying what sparks joy for you
and what doesn't.

34:15.845 --> 34:17.889
You've already done that so many times.

34:17.972 --> 34:21.142
You've come so far and there's
so much storage space in this house,

34:21.225 --> 34:23.895
so don't try to focus
on what you need to eliminate.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.523
You know, focus on what you wanna keep
and how you want to store them.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.984
-That should be your focus.
- Okay.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.321
<i>I have a lot of work to do,</i>
<i>but I've gotta try...</i>

34:33.404 --> 34:35.698
<i>things on my own</i>
<i>that I've never done before.</i>

34:35.948 --> 34:37.867
<i>I guess that's what this is all about.</i>

34:38.117 --> 34:41.079
<i>You know, preparing myself</i>
<i>for my next chapter.</i>

34:41.162 --> 34:43.539
<i>It stresses me that there's just so much.</i>

34:43.623 --> 34:46.959
But I am sucking it up,
I'm gonna be tough and get it done.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.712
-Thanks for all your help.
-Thank you!

34:49.796 --> 34:50.797
Okay, you guys.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.256
-I'll see you soon.
-Safe travels.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.382
Thank you.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.806
<i>Okay, empty shelves.</i>

35:00.681 --> 35:04.936
And I still have some more spices to go,

35:06.020 --> 35:09.565
in addition to all of this
that I already pulled out.

35:09.732 --> 35:13.069
A lot of the stuff that we had here
was for Rick's kind of cooking,

35:13.152 --> 35:14.946
so, I am going to figure out

35:15.029 --> 35:17.365
what sparks joy in my life

35:17.448 --> 35:19.450
at this moment going forward,

35:19.534 --> 35:22.453
and what kind of cooking
am I gonna be doing.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.539
Woo!

35:26.457 --> 35:29.460
Okay, this is a lot of stuff,
I've gotta go get a basket.

35:32.588 --> 35:34.632
Who knows what's in my chemical closet?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.135
This is a couple of years old.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.929
<i>I'm surprisingly feeling perky today</i>

35:40.012 --> 35:43.057
<i>'cause I've had a grueling week,</i>
<i>I have been at it,</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:44.892
<i>cleaning and sorting</i>

35:44.976 --> 35:46.060
and making decisions.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.855
Um, and maybe it's just because

35:48.938 --> 35:51.315
I see such progress, finally.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.819
Oh, here's some towels
I haven't seen in a decade.

35:54.902 --> 35:57.905
<i>Yeah, I'm getting the hang of it,</i>
<i>that's true.</i>

35:58.489 --> 36:00.992
Am I doing up top or down below?

36:01.075 --> 36:02.368
Yes, please.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.871
-Which one?
- All, all of it.

36:04.954 --> 36:08.124
<i>I'm enjoying</i>
<i>just not answering to anybody</i>

36:08.207 --> 36:10.585
<i>and not having to consult.</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:12.712
<i>That's kind of exciting.</i>

36:12.795 --> 36:15.423
I'm looking at my house with fresh eyes.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.971
So, I have a lot of photographs.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.222
I need some help.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.311
Absolutely, I'd be delighted to give you
a lesson on photographs today.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.437
-Okay. Okay.
-Yes.

36:33.983 --> 36:36.527
So, I have so many
photographs of 4th of July.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.528
Hmm.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.531
I have to look carefully,
like, how old were my kids, you know,

36:40.615 --> 36:41.866
to try to find out the year.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.534
These are all 4th of July.

36:46.412 --> 36:49.790
So, there are two ways to do this
and you can use both ways.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.085
You can of course categorize by year,
but you can also categorize by events.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.922
I did the same thing
when I was sorting though my photos.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.342
-Okay, that's probably a lot easier.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.511
And then I have some, you know,
other miscellaneous...

37:02.929 --> 37:04.639
-things that I've been saving.
-Of course.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.268
Are these sentimental
items as well?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.479
- Yeah, yeah.
-Sentimental, miscellaneous items.

37:11.562 --> 37:15.024
Yeah, so I, you know,
at least I have 'em in a box, but...

37:16.359 --> 37:19.612
You, Margie, you have
so many amazing, cute, craft goods.

37:19.695 --> 37:23.699
-You can make your own box that way.
-Oh, yeah, you know what? I could.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.494
I could-- Or make the labels
to go on them, you're right.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.411
Absolutely.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.254
Store sentimental items
in a way that sparks joy.

37:36.337 --> 37:40.675
For example, store them
in a box that sparks joy.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.237
So, separate them

38:01.320 --> 38:07.368
into the 80s, the 90s, the aughts...

38:09.370 --> 38:12.039
It's very, very good mix
of everything here.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.292
- Yeah! Look at my hair!

38:16.585 --> 38:19.255
- 80s? Maybe 80s?
-Oh, 80s, 80s.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.715
You know it's 80s.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.425
Oh, God!

38:24.343 --> 38:28.806
I think all the baby steps I have taken
has prepared me for this, this section.

38:29.557 --> 38:34.437
It got through to me, as in some way
I learned how easy it was

38:34.520 --> 38:37.523
to discard things, recycle things,
whatever it might be,

38:37.606 --> 38:40.359
but I haven't had as difficult a time

38:40.443 --> 38:43.237
parting with things
as I would have thought.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.948
I can feel that the energy is brighter

38:46.032 --> 38:49.327
and that you are enjoying your life more.

38:49.410 --> 38:53.706
And congratulations on successfully
completing all the categories.

38:53.789 --> 38:57.626
Thank you to my mentor
and mentor extraordinaire assistant.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.754
<i>In these last few weeks,</i>

38:59.837 --> 39:01.797
<i>I think I'm getting a better sense</i>

39:01.881 --> 39:05.634
<i>that I am definitely stronger</i>
<i>than I would ever have</i>

39:05.718 --> 39:07.345
<i>admitted to being.</i>

39:08.054 --> 39:10.931
So I-I, you know, that's why,
looking forward to the future,

39:11.015 --> 39:13.934
what is out there for me? I, I don't know.

39:14.060 --> 39:17.563
<i>I know I'm capable of so many things</i>
<i>and things that I have never considered.</i>

39:17.646 --> 39:20.066
<i>So, you know, that makes it fun</i>
<i>to get up each day</i>

39:20.149 --> 39:22.151
<i>and see what's gonna unfold.</i>

39:30.826 --> 39:33.162
There's a lot of stuff out here.
There must have been a garage sale.

39:35.956 --> 39:36.957
Ah!

39:37.083 --> 39:40.461
This looks really antique.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.546
Oh!

39:42.713 --> 39:45.883
There's containers over there too.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.933
-Hi!
- Hi!

39:54.016 --> 39:56.143
-Hi.
-It's so nice to meet you!

39:58.562 --> 40:01.440
Hello. This is my baby.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.234
- Oh!
-This is Lucy.

40:03.317 --> 40:06.695
Well, come on in!
We have a beautiful day here today.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.572
Yeah, it is beautiful out.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.325
Where do you want to start?
I'll be happy to show you.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.704
-Start with that room right there.
-Okay, lead the way.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.665
Can I take a peek
at the linen closet?

40:17.748 --> 40:19.125
Yes, linen closet.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.796
Tah-dah!

40:24.004 --> 40:25.005
Eh!

40:25.089 --> 40:26.674
<i>It looks so neat now!</i>

40:26.757 --> 40:28.092
<i>All by myself!</i>

40:31.512 --> 40:34.223
<i>The fact that you've mastered</i>
<i>how to store everything</i>

40:34.306 --> 40:38.060
<i>to this level means you can work</i>
<i>with any space going forward.</i>

40:38.144 --> 40:40.146
I'm realizing that through this journey.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.316
Okay, so, on to the next room.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.276
<i>Okay.</i>

40:53.492 --> 40:55.870
-Surprise!

40:56.620 --> 40:58.539
I am so surprised!

40:58.914 --> 41:01.083
My gosh, I'm floored!

41:04.044 --> 41:05.504
<i>I've been working so hard!</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:07.506
<i>This is a completely</i>
<i>different room!</i>

41:07.590 --> 41:09.216
- <i>It is.</i>
- <i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

41:09.300 --> 41:12.636
<i>I have been working so hard</i>
<i>and I wanted to surprise you!</i>

41:14.722 --> 41:18.434
I can't believe there's--
I can't believe you can touch the carpet!

41:21.729 --> 41:23.564
I never thought I'd be able
to do this

41:23.647 --> 41:26.025
and see this whole view of the carpet.

41:26.108 --> 41:29.153
And that's my new hashtag, I wrote it.
"KonMargie."

41:29.945 --> 41:31.363
Similar, but different.

41:38.662 --> 41:43.083
I think this will turn into a lovely room
for your hobbies and your passions.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.252
-Well, I did it.
- This room is complete!

41:45.336 --> 41:48.714
I know. I just haven't slept in two weeks.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.676
This process has been
very therapeutic, I think.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.261
<i>In many ways.</i>

41:55.262 --> 41:57.556
<i>It's sort of a rebirth for me.</i>

41:57.848 --> 41:59.975
<i>This lovely old house</i>

42:00.059 --> 42:03.479
<i>that there's been so many</i>
<i>wonderful memories shared here</i>

42:03.562 --> 42:05.314
<i>and so many more to make.</i>

42:06.607 --> 42:08.734
<i>And to see how it's gonna shift,</i>

42:09.485 --> 42:11.695
um, is anybody's guess at this point.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.782
<i>It is a little harder...</i>

42:14.865 --> 42:18.244
<i>Actually, it was a lot harder</i>
<i>than I thought it would be for myself.</i>

42:19.453 --> 42:20.829
<i>You're saying goodbye to a life</i>

42:20.913 --> 42:24.416
<i>and all his attire was so representative</i>

42:24.500 --> 42:27.753
<i>of our life together for so many years.</i>

42:27.836 --> 42:29.046
<i>It was hard.</i>

42:29.630 --> 42:33.259
But I-I have to think
that he would be proud.

42:33.717 --> 42:37.388
I-I could just visualize him
in the family room,

42:37.638 --> 42:39.974
in his spot, just sitting there,
with me...

42:40.474 --> 42:44.019
spinning circles around him,
'cause that was often the way life was.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.564
I hope he's amused and smiling down

42:46.647 --> 42:49.900
and giving me the thumbs up, saying,
"You're doing the right thing."

42:50.317 --> 42:54.029
<i>Unfortunately, Rick isn't here</i>
<i>to continue on</i>

42:54.113 --> 42:56.323
<i>with the plans that we had made</i>

42:56.407 --> 42:59.368
<i>and the dreams that we had</i>
<i>for our golden years,</i>

42:59.451 --> 43:01.579
but I don't feel despair.

43:01.662 --> 43:05.791
I feel, you know,
very happy for the life we lived,

43:05.874 --> 43:07.835
and going forward,

43:07.918 --> 43:10.754
I'm anxious and excited
for what lies ahead.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.508
So how do you feel, Lucy,

43:14.592 --> 43:16.468
seeing how your mother
progressed through this

43:16.552 --> 43:17.886
and made such huge strides?

43:17.970 --> 43:19.555
I am proud of her.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.391
It's gonna be great for her to have a...

43:22.683 --> 43:26.812
You can even feel the air
and the energy in the rooms has changed.

43:26.895 --> 43:31.650
Tidying Margie's home was
an unforgettable journey for me as well.

43:31.734 --> 43:34.945
I was so moved by "KonMargie's" endeavors.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.822
-Thank you again.
- We'll see you soon.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.782
Okay, bye.

43:39.074 --> 43:40.909
-Bye!
-Nice to meet you.

43:40.993 --> 43:43.871
I am so happy that I was able to assist

43:43.954 --> 43:46.123
Margie spark joy
in the next chapter of her life.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.876
I was moved deeply by this experience.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.211
It almost made me cry.
