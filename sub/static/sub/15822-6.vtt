00:19.640 --> 00:20.240
Good morning.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.040
Good morning.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.040
What's that?

00:31.250 --> 00:32.479
Real-estate flyer -- 

00:32.479 --> 00:35.460
four bedrooms, ranch style, big backyard, 

00:35.460 --> 00:38.700
a pool, a custom gourmet kitchen.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.780
-And it's within our price range?
-Yeah.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.560
Where's it located?

00:41.560 --> 00:45.230
New copper plumbing, new electric, new roof.

00:45.230 --> 00:46.510
Where, though?

00:46.510 --> 00:47.950
Great school district, 

00:47.950 --> 00:49.480
perfect for starting a family.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.660
Fritzy, where is it?

00:50.660 --> 00:52.040
Calabasas.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.930
Cal who?

00:55.170 --> 00:57.380
Your phone is the duplex, 

00:57.380 --> 00:58.900
this tissue box, 

00:58.900 --> 00:59.600
parker center, 

00:59.600 --> 01:01.870
your shoes,  

01:01.870 --> 01:03.740
the fbi on wilshire,

01:03.740 --> 01:05.990
your underwear......

01:07.130 --> 01:08.660
The valley.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.440
And calabasas is?

01:15.470 --> 01:16.220
There.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.480
That's not even los angeles.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.300
It's L.A.County.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.650
Just see the place before you decide you hate it.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.640
Brenda, los angeles is a big place.

01:25.640 --> 01:31.120
Are you saying you don't want me looking anywhere in the valley?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.070
Answer, answer, answer.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.920
Let it go to voice -- ...

01:38.920 --> 01:40.180
Mail.

01:40.180 --> 01:41.770
Deputy chief johnson.

01:41.770 --> 01:43.930
Yes, sergeant gabriel.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.970
When was that reported?

01:47.470 --> 01:50.710
Okay, where are you now?

01:51.370 --> 01:53.320
I'll be there shortly.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.720
Critical missing -- 

01:54.720 --> 01:58.210
13-year-old boy missing 1 hour and 35 minutes.

01:58.210 --> 01:59.790
You want to call the office and volunteer?

01:59.790 --> 02:02.840
We could practice carpooling.

02:31.390 --> 02:32.570
Sergei monroe -- 

02:32.570 --> 02:33.560
age 13.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.510
According to his parents, 

02:34.510 --> 02:35.820
they sent him to his room last night 

02:35.820 --> 02:38.870
for arguing with his 16-year-old sister, theresa, 

02:38.870 --> 02:41.030
at approximately 8:00 p.M.Yesterday evening.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.070
This morning, 6:00 a.M., 

02:42.070 --> 02:44.640
sergei's mother goes to wake him up, he's gone.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.130
They look around for about 30 minutes, 

02:46.130 --> 02:47.450
called 911.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.180
Do the monroes have a home-security system, 

02:49.180 --> 02:50.340
alarms, video cameras?

02:50.340 --> 02:52.270
No, but apparently sergei does have a cellphone.

02:52.270 --> 02:52.870
We've been calling it, 

02:52.870 --> 02:55.300
but it just keeps going straight to voice mail.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.940
Any sign of forced entry, busted windows, locks?

02:57.940 --> 03:00.180
No, and we interviewed mr.and mrs.Monroe, 

03:00.180 --> 03:01.660
and their daughter all individually, 

03:01.660 --> 03:02.740
and they all say the same thing.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.800
It was pretty much a normal evening.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.000
Chief, kid could be a runaway.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.040
He's done this before.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.920
His father said he only called 911 as a precaution anyway.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.200
Or because they're in denial.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.700
All right, david.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.210
Mrs.Monroe, mr.Monroe, 

03:21.210 --> 03:23.530
i'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the l.A.P.D., 

03:23.530 --> 03:26.240
and this is agent fritz howard from the fbi.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.460
Oh, my god -- fbi?

03:27.460 --> 03:29.060
Yeah, we help out with critical missings.

03:29.060 --> 03:30.270
Critical?What?

03:30.270 --> 03:32.690
Anytime a child 13 or under goes missing, 

03:32.690 --> 03:35.320
we classify their return as our highest priority, 

03:35.320 --> 03:38.020
which means we won't stop looking until we find your son.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.690
But sergei's just -- 

03:39.690 --> 03:40.720
i told your detectives, 

03:40.720 --> 03:42.390
he's probably gonna show up at school any minute, 

03:42.390 --> 03:43.440
or if he tries to come home, 

03:43.440 --> 03:46.110
he's gonna see all of you here and think he's in even more trouble.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.240
Sergei's run away twice before.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.050
He's had a few problems adapting lately.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.210
Adapting to what?

03:52.210 --> 03:53.240
America.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.080
Where's he from?

03:54.080 --> 03:54.940
Russia.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.840
We adopted him five years ago.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.810
And you found him through?

03:58.810 --> 04:00.070
An orphanage.

04:00.070 --> 04:01.880
He had no family.There's no one.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.620
There's no one in russia that's gonna be looking for sergei 

04:04.620 --> 04:05.910
or trying to kidnap him.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.090
This is -- my god...

04:07.090 --> 04:09.990
So, the last time you saw sergei was 8:00 p.M.Last night 

04:09.990 --> 04:12.990
after you sent him to his room for arguing with his sister.
-Yes.

04:12.990 --> 04:15.380
And what was the argument about?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.940
Just him using theresa's things without permission.

04:17.940 --> 04:21.290
I mean, this is nothing we haven't gone through before.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.290
And where's your daughter now?

04:23.940 --> 04:26.930
Theresa, we need to talk to you again.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.680
Theresa, open the door, please.

04:37.790 --> 04:42.700
So, the entire world stops to pay attention to sergei.Is that it?

04:43.690 --> 04:46.550
-I see you like your privacy.
-Uh-huh.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.630
You see my hair?

04:48.630 --> 04:50.190
It used to be a lot longer than this.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.230
Then one night sergei thought it would be funny 

04:52.230 --> 04:54.160
to cut it off while i was sleeping.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.480
He does cute stuff like that -- 

04:55.480 --> 04:58.650
for example, torturing and killing my cat.

04:58.650 --> 05:00.320
And no matter what dad tells you, 

05:00.320 --> 05:01.940
that's why he put the lock on my door -- 

05:01.940 --> 05:04.320
because sergei is a psycho.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.750
You and sergei had an argument last night.

05:05.750 --> 05:06.900
What was that about?

05:06.900 --> 05:10.200
He and his little pathetic friend jason were -- 

05:10.200 --> 05:12.030
jason -- who's jason?

05:12.030 --> 05:13.590
Jason hetner.

05:13.590 --> 05:15.030
He'll do anything sergei tells him.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.310
It's pitiful.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.970
And yesterday they both created yet another nightmare 

05:18.970 --> 05:21.290
for our next-door neighbor, mr.Taft.

05:21.290 --> 05:22.600
What did they do to the neighbor -- 

05:22.600 --> 05:23.350
your brother and -- 

05:23.350 --> 05:25.500
sergei's not my brother!

05:25.500 --> 05:27.790
He's only here because my mom wanted to have a boy, 

05:27.790 --> 05:29.280
and she couldn't have one herself.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.170
Okay, you listen to me, theresa.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.160
Sergei is missing.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.420
This is very serious!

05:33.420 --> 05:34.610
Someone may have taken him or -- 

05:34.610 --> 05:36.130
taken him?

05:37.090 --> 05:39.510
Come with me.

06:02.510 --> 06:07.190
You really think someone would want to abduct a kid who draws like this?

06:07.190 --> 06:10.830
Dad has to paint over the walls in here all the time.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.000
Chief, excuse me.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.330
There's something you should see.

06:17.330 --> 06:20.450
You're so worried about what someone might be doing to sergei.

06:20.450 --> 06:21.530
I think you should be more concerned 

06:21.530 --> 06:25.290
about what sergei is doing to someone else.

06:39.450 --> 06:43.080
Yo, move out a sec.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.040
Thanks.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.170
Dried blood.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.870
Yeah, i think so, too.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.550
S.I.D.Is analyzing the sample right now.

06:50.550 --> 06:51.690
And the turn signal's cracked.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.640
Is that hair?

06:53.640 --> 06:55.350
It is.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.860
Short, black, pulled from the root.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.330
Could be the boy's.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.010
Looks close.

07:01.010 --> 07:01.780
Whose car is this?

07:01.780 --> 07:02.340
Theresa's.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.660
Okay, let's impound the vehicle, 

07:03.660 --> 07:05.340
and theresa also said something about sergei 

07:05.340 --> 07:06.990
and a next-door neighbor, a mr.Taft.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.360
Let's see if we can talk to him.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.100
Chief, chief, this way.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.070
According to a lady three houses down, 

07:17.070 --> 07:19.280
a mr.Taft -- divorced, lives alone -- 

07:19.280 --> 07:21.610
had an argument last night with mr.Monroe.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.370
They were standing right out here in the street, 

07:23.370 --> 07:25.690
screaming and yelling at each other about sergei.

07:25.690 --> 07:27.370
Now, she doesn't know why.

07:27.370 --> 07:31.130
Sanchez is already over here at the taft house, right here.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.740
So, we're looking at a runaway here or not?

07:32.740 --> 07:34.750
I'd rather have sergei answer that question.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.370
Look here.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.620
These look like fresh tire tracks, chief.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.010
See if they match theresa's car.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.910
Chief, no one's answering the door, 

07:40.910 --> 07:42.870
but there's something in the backyard that we should look at.

07:42.870 --> 07:44.470
Okay.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.650
Is it locked?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.590
Fritzy, do you mind?

07:51.070 --> 07:54.230
Want to lose the bag?

07:54.920 --> 07:55.570
What is that?

07:55.570 --> 07:56.360
A grave?

07:56.360 --> 07:59.190
We got to get in there.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.700
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.160
Detective, call judge reisser.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.380
Get a search warrant for the house, the yard, and the cars.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.790
Okay, meanwhile, gentlemen, we have exigent circumstances, 

08:07.790 --> 08:09.090
so let's start digging now.

08:09.090 --> 08:10.020
You don't want to wait for a warrant?

08:10.020 --> 08:10.910
No, no.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.270
That grave is probable cause.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.250
Shovel, shovel, please!

08:14.250 --> 08:15.570
Get the warrant anyway.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.520
I don't want a murderer to get away on a technicality.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.250
Okay.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.170
Thank you, thank you, detective.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.300
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.380
I got something.I got something.

08:29.380 --> 08:31.020
Okay.

08:36.419 --> 08:38.520
Easy, easy.

08:40.860 --> 08:42.350
It's stiff, chief.It's stiff.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.110
Okay, okay.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.410
Hey, hey!

08:45.410 --> 08:46.740
Hey, what's going on here?!

08:46.740 --> 08:47.670
What are you doing on my property?!

08:47.670 --> 08:49.220
L.A.P.D.We've got a search warrant.

08:49.220 --> 08:49.930
Get him out of here.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.360
-What the hell is going on here?!
-We have a warrant, sir.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.990
You have no right to do this!No right!

08:53.990 --> 08:56.310
-What the hell are you doing on my property?!
-Police business, sir.

08:56.310 --> 08:59.660
You have no right to do this!No right!

09:09.770 --> 09:11.320
Instead of digging up ralphie, 

09:11.320 --> 09:13.760
why don't you arrest that little son of a bitch sergei 

09:13.760 --> 09:15.100
that killed my dog?

09:15.100 --> 09:17.570
You saw sergei monroe do this to your dog?

09:17.570 --> 09:18.810
Trust me -- 

09:18.810 --> 09:20.500
the kid did it.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.790
When was the last time you saw him?

09:21.790 --> 09:22.830
Yesterday morning.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.650
What -- is sergei missing?

09:24.650 --> 09:25.800
Did he run away...

09:25.800 --> 09:27.000
Again?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.070
'Cause if he has, 

09:28.070 --> 09:31.170
why don't you do everyone in the neighborhood a favor 

09:31.170 --> 09:32.890
and stop looking for him?

09:32.890 --> 09:36.390
Sir, i find your attitude towards this boy worrisome.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.260
How about this for an attitude?

09:38.260 --> 09:40.210
I want that kid dead.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.660
How about that?

09:43.130 --> 09:45.130
You want some more suspects?

09:45.130 --> 09:46.760
Why don't you go up and down our street?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.740
Ask anyone, 'cause everyone hates sergei -- 

09:49.740 --> 09:50.830
not just me.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.780
And his parents are useless.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.400
Why didn't you report him to the police then?

09:54.400 --> 09:55.330
I did!

09:55.330 --> 09:56.640
But you people -- 

09:56.640 --> 09:58.900
you didn't do anything at all.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.880
And what's the result?

10:00.880 --> 10:02.260
Yesterday i came home from work 

10:02.260 --> 10:05.740
to find my dog dead on my front lawn.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.580
Sergei and that creepy kid -- 

10:07.580 --> 10:09.680
they let him out of the backyard 

10:09.680 --> 10:12.880
and they ran him down in cold blood.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.900
Now, when you say sergei ran over ralphie, 

10:15.900 --> 10:18.500
you mean this 13-year-old kid was driving the vehicle?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.460
Yeah, yeah, he's done it several times.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.660
He takes his big sister's car out on the street for a race.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.530
And that's against the law, isn't it?

10:26.530 --> 10:27.740
What'd you do about that?

10:27.740 --> 10:28.960
Nothing.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.290
So, after you found your dog, 

10:30.290 --> 10:33.220
you went across the street and argued with sergei's father.

10:33.220 --> 10:37.700
I told brian before that i would sue his ass, and i will.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.790
What else did you tell him?

10:39.790 --> 10:41.400
A neighbor heard you arguing.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.180
Did you threaten sergei?

10:43.180 --> 10:44.970
I don't remember what i said.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.260
I'll tell you what i did.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.550
I took my dog, 

10:50.110 --> 10:52.140
who never hurt anyone, 

10:52.140 --> 10:55.410
and i gave him a decent burial.

10:55.410 --> 10:58.440
And then i got drunk.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.430
And if that's a crime, 

11:00.430 --> 11:03.240
then go ahead and arrest me.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.970
Excuse me one second.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.780
Yeah, uh, listen...

11:09.780 --> 11:13.260
Let's you and i go take a walk, okay?

11:13.260 --> 11:16.670
Do me a favor.Put your hands in your pockets.

11:19.670 --> 11:24.220
Okay, do you want to arrest mr.Taft for burying his dog in his backyard?

11:24.220 --> 11:25.570
Ralphie is not our victim.

11:25.570 --> 11:26.780
But he could be our motive.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.780
Or a good reason for sergei to vamoose.

11:29.780 --> 11:32.130
It explains why the monroes weren't very specific 

11:32.130 --> 11:34.640
about the argument they had with their son.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.840
I sent a patrol car over to check sergei's best friend, jason.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.680
Nobody home, and he didn't go to school today, either.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.230
But no one's reported him missing, 

11:43.230 --> 11:45.480
and jason and sergei both have rap sheets.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.910
I'm waiting to get them, but who knows?

11:46.910 --> 11:49.080
Maybe they took off somewhere together.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.800
So, we need to have a discussion about circumstances.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.330
What circumstances?

11:54.330 --> 11:56.200
You want to call off the critical missing?

11:56.200 --> 11:59.060
This kid, sergei, has an extensive juvenile record 

11:59.060 --> 12:00.420
and a history of running away.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.320
It appears that his father punished him, 

12:02.320 --> 12:03.530
not unjustly, 

12:03.530 --> 12:05.380
and the boy ran off in the middle of the night.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.720
If we investigated everything based on appearances, 

12:07.720 --> 12:09.000
we'd have a whole lot less to do.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.800
Do i get a vote here?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.260
I think it is too early to say what happened.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.560
I'd like a vote, too, because, as of 3:00 p.M.Today, 

12:15.560 --> 12:17.690
i'm gonna have both presidential candidates in town, 

12:17.690 --> 12:20.800
and i guess i'm gonna have to decide which one not to protect.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.260
So, tell me, chief johnson, 

12:22.260 --> 12:25.350
is half my security force out there looking for a runaway?

12:25.350 --> 12:27.750
You want me to decide right now if this is a critical missing?

12:27.750 --> 12:28.580
I do.

12:28.580 --> 12:33.290
Would you be applying this kind of pressure if it was your kid we were looking for?

12:38.580 --> 12:41.510
The city of los angeles does not want or expect me 

12:41.510 --> 12:45.210
to run this department the way i do my family.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.070
Sergei was two weeks shy of his 14th birthday.

12:49.070 --> 12:51.810
If his parents called 911 15 days later,

12:51.810 --> 12:53.910
we would have sent one patrol car, two uniforms, 

12:53.910 --> 12:55.480
and filed a report.

12:55.480 --> 12:59.250
So, what are we doing here?

12:59.250 --> 13:02.290
It doesn't feel like a critical missing.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.570
-It really doesn't.
-Thank you.

13:03.570 --> 13:06.610
Priority homicide will continue the search for sergei monroe.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.960
Meanwhile, commander taylor, break down the crisis center.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.670
Tell the press that, in line with the family's wishes, 

13:11.670 --> 13:15.310
we're treating this situation as a runaway.

13:15.310 --> 13:16.850
Agent howard, if you remain concerned, 

13:16.850 --> 13:20.170
you're welcome to stay, of course.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.100
Chief, that guy's crying again.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.250
I put him in the back of my car.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.320
What do you want me to do with him?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.720
Uh, lieutenant flynn, you can let mr.Taft go for now.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.700
And if you would, please help me take ralphie back across the street.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.130
Thank you.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.310
Okay.

13:44.310 --> 13:47.290
Chief, the blood on the front of theresa monroe's car is, 

13:47.290 --> 13:48.510
as suspected, canine, 

13:48.510 --> 13:49.780
and they've matched one of the hairs 

13:49.780 --> 13:52.700
embedded in the front fender to poor ralphie.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.590
Who was run over by sergei, 

13:55.590 --> 13:57.120
if we can believe mr.Taft.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.230
Chief, i'm guessing that you can trust mr.Taft on this.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.250
I mean, apart from being a building contractor -- 

14:02.250 --> 14:05.850
and i've never had a good experience with a building contractor yet -- 

14:05.850 --> 14:07.520
mr.Taft has no record.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.820
Well, our boy sergei's got him beat big-time.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.240
I've got his rap sheet here.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.790
Charges range from vandalism to marijuana possession.

14:15.790 --> 14:18.090
Underage driving without a license?

14:18.090 --> 14:18.740
Twice.

14:18.740 --> 14:23.660
Also, three times for truancy and disturbing the peace with guess who.

14:23.660 --> 14:24.660
Jason hetner.

14:24.660 --> 14:27.120
Hey, maybe these two boys are just hiding out together.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.940
Or they were abducted together.

14:28.940 --> 14:32.750
Jason's 14 -- 6 months older than sergei.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.850
His parents divorced last year, 

14:34.850 --> 14:37.030
and he's been slipping out of school ever since, 

14:37.030 --> 14:39.440
compiling his own history with the l.A.P.D.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.500
Tried contacting his mother on her cell, home, and office --

14:43.500 --> 14:44.220
no answer

14:44.220 --> 14:47.370
Yeah, and there's still no answer at the door at the house, either.

14:47.370 --> 14:50.790
Okay, i want to check the dates on their arrest records, 

14:50.790 --> 14:54.310
see how often they were picked up together and, um -- 

14:54.310 --> 14:55.850
and where.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.010
Uh, detective sanchez.

14:57.010 --> 14:58.620
As soon as either one of them makes a call, 

14:58.620 --> 15:02.620
we can lock onto the cellphone tower they're using and find them.

15:02.620 --> 15:06.080
Why have you stopped looking for my son?

15:08.470 --> 15:12.960
My whole division is applying every resource at its disposal to find your son.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.410
So, mr.Monroe, this morning, 

15:14.410 --> 15:16.310
you were certain that sergei had run away.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.450
He's never been gone more than five hours before -- never.

15:19.450 --> 15:21.570
And you said you wouldn't stop the search until you found him.

15:21.570 --> 15:24.330
I haven't stopped.

15:24.330 --> 15:25.670
But i have been seriously delayed 

15:25.670 --> 15:28.780
because both you and your wife withheld information from me 

15:28.780 --> 15:31.510
about the so-called family argument last night.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.430
All right, look, 

15:34.430 --> 15:36.140
mr.Taft is already very upset.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.360
I didn't want to drag him into this.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.350
Drag him into it?

15:38.350 --> 15:40.390
Sir, if mr.Taft's story is true, 

15:40.390 --> 15:43.630
he may well be the reason that sergei is missing.

15:43.630 --> 15:48.000
-Now, did sergei run over his dog?
-Yes.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.380
-With theresa's car?
-Yes.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.380
Jason let the dog out.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.050
Sergei ran him down.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.760
We asked theresa not to mention this to you.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.340
Because?

15:56.340 --> 15:59.180
Because we were afraid that if you thought sergei was a problem child, 

15:59.180 --> 16:01.670
instead of bringing him home, you might arrest him.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.880
Look, we're mortified about the entire situation.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.460
We apologize.

16:07.460 --> 16:11.820
And we're slow to understand how terrible it could be.

16:11.820 --> 16:14.820
I mean, do you have anything at all?

16:14.820 --> 16:17.700
The name jason hetner keeps coming up, 

16:17.700 --> 16:19.220
and we can't find him, either.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.490
Jason's missing, too?

16:20.490 --> 16:22.830
Not technically.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.340
But we can't find him, and we'd really like to.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.420
Well, jason's a bad influence.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.750
There's no question about it.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.310
We tried to separate them.

16:31.310 --> 16:33.470
But his mother won't call us back or meet with us, 

16:33.470 --> 16:35.000
even though they've been arrested together.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.140
Uh, speaking of...

16:36.140 --> 16:37.390
Yes, sergeant, what'd you find?

16:37.390 --> 16:39.370
Jason and sergei both have been reported 

16:39.370 --> 16:42.360
for trespassing three times at a place known as the tunnels.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.000
It's a neighborhood magnet for -- 

16:44.000 --> 16:44.930
we know what it's a magnet for, 

16:44.930 --> 16:48.090
and i've absolutely forbidden sergei to go there again.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.010
I mean, it's dangerous.

16:49.010 --> 16:50.960
Why -- 

16:51.910 --> 16:53.520
oh, susan, we should go there 

16:53.520 --> 16:54.990
and see if he's there or if jason's there.

16:54.990 --> 16:56.060
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:56.060 --> 16:56.600
We're going.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.830
I would like to come with you.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.070
Look, ma'am, i understand why you would like to come, 

17:00.070 --> 17:01.300
but it is more important that 

17:01.300 --> 17:04.349
you and your husband go home and wait for sergei to call.

17:04.349 --> 17:07.180
No, no, our daughter's there with the people you have covering the phones, 

17:07.180 --> 17:09.680
and theresa will call us the second that sergei comes back.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.349
If he sees me, if he hears me call his name, 

17:12.349 --> 17:13.920
he'd be more likely to answer.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.300
Please, i do better with him than anyone else.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.350
Sergei?!

17:36.350 --> 17:37.350
Sergei, it's mom!

17:37.350 --> 17:39.580
Mrs.Monroe, i have to ask you not to call out, please.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.820
We don't know who all's in here.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.770
Thank you.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.160
Nice hideout.

17:46.620 --> 17:49.160
All right, lieutenant provenza, please wait here with the parents.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.700
Lieutenant tao, i'd like to get a patrol car or two, 

17:52.700 --> 17:54.670
if we can get them.

17:54.670 --> 17:57.980
All right, then, let's see what all's down here.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.290
L.A.P.D.

18:13.290 --> 18:16.200
Anyone in here?

18:19.090 --> 18:21.280
Just a rat.Just a rat.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.190
Relax.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.810
Chief?Chief!

18:35.540 --> 18:37.860
Oh, god.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.220
Okay, okay, okay.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.610
Okay, detective sanchez, lieutenant flynn, 

18:52.610 --> 18:54.830
let's find out if sergei's by himself in here.

18:54.830 --> 18:57.530
Detective daniels, please step outside and call the morgue and s.I.D.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.440
I need this place checked for a weapon and blood.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.260
And i want the search revved up for jason hetner, please.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.280
You got it.

19:08.990 --> 19:11.230
Hey, where are you going?!

19:11.560 --> 19:13.450
I'm getting some air.

19:13.450 --> 19:17.340
Besides, this isn't a critical missing anymore, is it?

19:21.680 --> 19:22.810
What did you find?!

19:22.810 --> 19:24.230
Hello?!

19:24.230 --> 19:26.810
Is he in there?!Did you find him?!

19:26.810 --> 19:28.910
Hello?!

19:28.920 --> 19:32.770
Suffered two blowsto the head from an almost-blunt instrument -- 

19:32.770 --> 19:35.530
a bad hit here at the left temple, 

19:35.530 --> 19:39.670
then a very bad hit here at the left central parietal bone -- 

19:39.670 --> 19:42.110
death almost instantaneous.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.010
There wasn't a lot of blood where we found him.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.060
Then he died elsewhere.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.910
Hmm, that also explains why we found no weapon.

19:47.910 --> 19:51.140
Well, look for something that leaves a waffle pattern.

19:51.140 --> 19:54.490
See this cross-hatching with dimples?

19:54.490 --> 19:56.420
Probably some sort of tool, i'm guessing.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.120
Like for construction?

19:58.120 --> 20:00.860
Maybe something a building contractor might have.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.460
Sounds right.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.150
Were there any signs of molestation?

20:08.150 --> 20:09.830
No, thank god.

20:09.830 --> 20:13.330
The poor kid was murdered, but it stopped there.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.800
Would you preserve the wounds for me, doctor?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.680
With a casting or the epidermis itself?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.920
Uh, cut out the actual wound, please.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.020
Thank you.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.370
Would you like that for here or to go?

20:27.950 --> 20:28.630
Doctor.

20:28.630 --> 20:30.180
Chief pope.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.310
Uh, time of death?

20:32.310 --> 20:34.960
The boy was found in a dark, moist place, 

20:34.960 --> 20:36.660
which could have sped up the decomp.

20:36.660 --> 20:42.570
So, i'd have to say, broadly, between 6 and 24 hours.

20:45.450 --> 20:47.250
Thank you.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.790
As soon as you can, please, doctor.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.570
Excuse me.

20:56.340 --> 21:01.660
I-i made a horrible mistake.

21:02.940 --> 21:05.920
Will, we have two things to rely on -- 

21:05.920 --> 21:08.260
instinct and training.

21:09.070 --> 21:10.400
We went with our gut feelings, and -- 

21:10.400 --> 21:12.520
because of that, this boy is dead.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.560
We don't know our culpability yet.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.340
Sergei could have left the house in the middle of the night.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.760
He could have been dead before we got the call.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.560
And on his body, we found a cellphone and some pot, 

21:21.560 --> 21:23.080
so -- so, it wasn't a robbery.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.090
What are you suggesting then?

21:25.090 --> 21:26.430
This was, what?

21:26.430 --> 21:29.950
A fight between friends or that sergei was a little drug dealer?

21:29.950 --> 21:30.910
'Cause that's a big "so what?" 

21:30.910 --> 21:34.470
he's still a 13-year-old kid.

21:34.470 --> 21:35.200
What about this friend -- 

21:35.200 --> 21:36.620
this jason hetner.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.640
Is he a suspect or another possible victim?

21:39.640 --> 21:42.020
Uh, i can't say.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.650
We are having trouble locating him, 

21:43.650 --> 21:46.770
but i have the rest of my detectives and six patrol cars out looking for him.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.680
All right, as of now, jason hetner is missing.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.650
Use any resources you have to find him.

21:51.650 --> 21:52.820
I don't care what it costs.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.940
Excuse me, chiefs, detective sanchez just found jason.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.010
He's on his way down to parker center with him right now.

21:58.010 --> 22:00.070
Is the boy all right?

22:00.070 --> 22:01.730
He's okay enough to run.

22:01.730 --> 22:03.440
The little bastard's fast, too.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.050
Yeah, so, his mother finally comes home, 

22:05.050 --> 22:06.330
and we ask her, you know, 

22:06.330 --> 22:07.440
"can we look in your garage?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.340
Can we look in your son's room?" 

22:09.340 --> 22:10.070
and she says, 

22:10.070 --> 22:12.070
"is this all because he skipped school again?" 

22:12.070 --> 22:13.470
like it was nothing at all.

22:13.470 --> 22:14.360
Is she here now?

22:14.430 --> 22:15.140
Jason's mother?

22:15.140 --> 22:15.920
Too tired.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.840
Great mom, huh?

22:16.840 --> 22:18.210
Didn't see her son this morning.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.790
Hadn't seen him since last night.

22:19.790 --> 22:22.140
She finally lets us into jason's room.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.640
And as i'm looking in the kid's closet, 

22:24.640 --> 22:26.560
guess who crawls out from under the bed.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.520
And he jumps out the window, 

22:27.520 --> 22:29.330
and i have to chase him for five blocks.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.510
So, any chance this boy is our murderer?

22:31.510 --> 22:33.320
He ran.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.100
Okay, let's go, sergeant.

22:38.790 --> 22:42.340
Good work, good work.

22:43.810 --> 22:44.910
Hello, jason.

22:44.910 --> 22:46.650
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

22:46.650 --> 22:49.970
I just have a few questions about the last 24 hours.

22:49.970 --> 22:52.330
Questions i don't have to answer, right?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.580
That's true.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.610
Instead of you and i having a little conversation, 

22:55.610 --> 22:57.740
i could arrest you and send you to juvie.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.880
And since you've demonstrated that you're a flight risk, 

22:59.880 --> 23:02.010
i will personally speak at your petition to detain.

23:02.010 --> 23:05.740
You'll be in custody for the entire six months leading up to your trial.

23:05.740 --> 23:09.200
Is that really how you want to spend your summer and fall?

23:09.810 --> 23:11.100
No.

23:11.100 --> 23:14.060
Let's try the questions, then, shall we?

23:15.780 --> 23:19.690
You are friends with sergei monroe, are you not?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.900
Ask sergei who his friends are.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.300
All right, never mind.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.310
Book this little smart aleck.

23:25.310 --> 23:29.690
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.Wait.Wait a minute!

23:29.690 --> 23:32.270
How much trouble am i in?

23:32.270 --> 23:35.580
Well, i can guarantee you it's gonna get worse 

23:35.580 --> 23:38.330
if you don't cooperate.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.520
Fine, fine.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.680
I'll tell you what happened yesterday.

23:44.180 --> 23:47.030
I just want some protection.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.740
Protection from who?

23:52.740 --> 23:55.310
From sergei.

23:55.310 --> 23:58.890
And why do you need protection from him?

24:00.670 --> 24:02.940
He makes me do things.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.070
Makes you?

24:04.070 --> 24:05.150
How does he make you?

24:05.150 --> 24:06.170
He just does.

24:06.170 --> 24:08.130
Well, what does he use?A knife, a gun?

24:08.130 --> 24:11.140
I mean, come on, you're bigger than sergei.

24:11.370 --> 24:12.970
He knows.

24:12.970 --> 24:14.680
He knows certain things about me.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.160
What things?

24:16.160 --> 24:18.720
That's not part of the story, okay?

24:18.720 --> 24:19.280
God, all right?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.500
He just makes me do things!

24:20.500 --> 24:24.970
I need to know what that means or i am leaving.

24:26.490 --> 24:27.350
I'm leaving.

24:27.350 --> 24:28.330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:28.330 --> 24:30.670
Wait a minute!

24:31.800 --> 24:33.140
Okay.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.960
If you want to know, okay.

24:36.420 --> 24:43.160
Sergei pulled me into an alley once, and...

24:43.160 --> 24:46.530
He grabbed my hand...

24:46.530 --> 24:49.480
Pulled me towards him...

24:49.480 --> 24:52.520
Asked me if i...

24:54.370 --> 24:56.800
He asked me...

24:57.000 --> 25:01.500
Are you saying sergei made sexual advances on you?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.010
Yes.

25:03.010 --> 25:05.540
What did he do?

25:05.540 --> 25:08.010
He......

25:08.450 --> 25:11.760
Asked me if i wanted to kiss him.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.170
And i did.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.480
But sergei didn't.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.420
It was a trap.

25:19.420 --> 25:20.500
Then every day after that, 

25:20.580 --> 25:25.080
he threatened to tell people all about me.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.620
So, he's been blackmailing you?

25:28.620 --> 25:30.600
Yeah.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.210
Ain't love grand?

25:32.210 --> 25:33.770
Geez louise.

25:33.770 --> 25:35.130
This sergei kid.

25:35.130 --> 25:37.230
He can't know that i'm telling you this.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.110
That's a promise i can keep, 

25:39.110 --> 25:42.170
provided that you tell me exactly what happened yesterday.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.700
Okay.

25:45.700 --> 25:51.660
So, sergei wanted me to let ralphie out in mr.Taft's yard.

25:51.660 --> 25:54.480
He was gonna drive theresa's car up the street, 

25:54.480 --> 25:56.410
and the dog would chase it.

25:56.410 --> 25:57.690
I opened the gate, 

25:57.690 --> 26:00.550
and ralphie ran out in the front yard.

26:00.550 --> 26:02.450
But sergei didn't drive off.

26:02.450 --> 26:04.450
He...

26:04.450 --> 26:07.080
He gunned the car over the curb, 

26:07.080 --> 26:09.470
and he hit the dog.

26:09.470 --> 26:10.640
I jumped off the fence.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.600
I ran, and i tried to help ralphie, 

26:13.600 --> 26:15.020
but he was making these -- 

26:15.020 --> 26:17.910
these gurgling sounds.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.470
Okay?

26:18.470 --> 26:19.450
I'm sorry.

26:19.450 --> 26:21.250
Okay, okay.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.120
What happened then?

26:22.120 --> 26:27.260
Well, then, i made sergei take the car back into the garage.

26:27.260 --> 26:30.410
And look, really, if i had known that he -- 

26:30.410 --> 26:32.200
that he was gonna kill ralphie, 

26:32.200 --> 26:33.420
i would have never helped him -- 

26:33.420 --> 26:34.030
never.

26:34.030 --> 26:36.000
So, did you fight with him after that?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.700
Did you punish him for what he did to ralphie?

26:38.700 --> 26:41.550
Punish him?

26:41.550 --> 26:44.730
You're kidding, right?

26:45.910 --> 26:50.470
Jason, sergei monroe was found dead this afternoon 

26:50.470 --> 26:52.480
in a place you two were known to hang out -- 

26:52.480 --> 26:54.100
the tunnels.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.570
What?

26:56.970 --> 26:59.660
He -- how did...

27:00.610 --> 27:02.780
Wait, oh, my -- you think that -- 

27:02.780 --> 27:04.560
you think that i killed him?!

27:04.560 --> 27:05.540
It w-wasn't me!

27:05.610 --> 27:07.710
It was mr.Taft!It was mr.Taft!

27:07.710 --> 27:09.540
I'm telling you, it was mr.Taft, okay?!

27:09.540 --> 27:11.020
How do you know it was mr.Taft?

27:11.020 --> 27:12.100
Because i-i heard him.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.350
He was screaming at mr.Monroe in the street, okay?

27:15.350 --> 27:17.610
And -- and he was saying to him how he was gonna -- 

27:17.610 --> 27:19.220
how he's gonna kill sergei.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.180
Right back where we started.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.780
But i didn't hear anything after that, damn it.

27:21.780 --> 27:24.840
Because that's when sergei's sister came in the garage 

27:24.840 --> 27:26.520
when we were hammering out the dents.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.280
And she was freaking out, and i ran.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.070
I just ran.

27:29.070 --> 27:33.450
Did you say hammering out the dents?

27:36.990 --> 27:41.480
Voice-mail recordings from sergei monroe's cellphone minus the messages from l.A.P.D.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.820
Okay, thank you.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.960
Uh, do you have a flashlight, lieutenant, 

27:55.960 --> 27:57.930
and a cellphone, please?

27:58.890 --> 28:00.200
Thank you.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.130
Thanks.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.370
Are you looking for something, chief?

28:11.790 --> 28:14.840
A circular waffle pattern......

28:16.130 --> 28:18.360
That matches...

28:18.360 --> 28:20.200
This.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.150
What do you think, lieutenant?

28:23.150 --> 28:26.330
I think you got a match.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.600
You want me to take off the fender?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.920
Yes, please, and could you bring it to the murder room?

28:29.920 --> 28:30.890
Thank you.

28:30.890 --> 28:35.490
Luis, pull that fender.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.800
What makes a child go bad -- 

28:42.800 --> 28:44.460
nature or nurture?

28:44.460 --> 28:47.800
Unfortunately, chief, by the time we get involved, 

28:47.800 --> 28:50.780
it really doesn't matter.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.410
Sergei, this is theresa, and i hate your stupid guts.

29:02.410 --> 29:03.760
I hate you!

29:03.760 --> 29:05.710
You've ruined my car, and when you get home, 

29:05.710 --> 29:07.700
i'm going to kill you!

29:07.700 --> 29:11.860
Message received yesterday at 7:18 a.M.

29:11.860 --> 29:14.290
Damn it, sergei, the police are outside your house!

29:14.290 --> 29:16.530
Man, leave me out of this.

29:16.530 --> 29:21.060
Message received yesterday at 7:43 a.M.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.010
Sergei, you're destroying this family.

29:23.010 --> 29:24.430
Mom can't stop crying.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.360
Dad's going out of his mind, all because of you.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.290
I hope you're dead.

29:28.290 --> 29:32.530
I hope you've been run over the same way you ran over ralphie.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.310
Hey.

29:34.810 --> 29:37.050
Sounds like there's more than one problem child out there.

29:37.050 --> 29:40.590
There are no more messages in your mailbo-- 

29:40.590 --> 29:41.770
you were right.

29:41.770 --> 29:44.020
I should have kept the critical-missing designation.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.770
Yeah.

29:45.770 --> 29:47.900
Well......

29:49.430 --> 29:52.970
The odds were stacked against you from the start.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.900
Hey, i was looking at that.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.430
It sold already.

30:00.430 --> 30:01.540
You were right.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.760
It was too far away.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.880
The only reason to move out there is the schools.

30:05.880 --> 30:10.020
Otherwise, maybe more house than we need.

30:10.020 --> 30:14.440
Maybe more trouble than we want to go through.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.650
What do you think?

30:18.200 --> 30:19.960
Let's talk about it tonight.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.200
Is that okay?

30:21.200 --> 30:23.100
Okay.

30:24.210 --> 30:29.560
-Hey, have a good day at work.
-You too.

30:46.230 --> 30:48.770
Lieutenant provenza, good morning.

30:48.770 --> 30:50.540
I'm on my way to the morgue, 

30:50.540 --> 30:54.340
and i need you to do a few things for me first.

30:59.130 --> 31:01.240
Will?

31:02.210 --> 31:06.910
You had lieutenant provenza arrest theresa monroe for murdering her brother?

31:06.910 --> 31:08.200
Yes.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.590
Time of death?

31:09.590 --> 31:12.700
I won't know exactly until i get the confession.

31:12.700 --> 31:16.740
All right, well, uh, i'll watch then.

31:16.740 --> 31:17.870
Excuse me.

31:17.870 --> 31:19.370
Theresa's parents haven't asked for a lawyer, 

31:19.370 --> 31:21.670
but they do want to be in the room while you talk to her.

31:21.670 --> 31:23.940
Buzz has already set up some extra cameras.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.730
I'll take care of it.

31:24.730 --> 31:27.360
Uh, lieutenant, i need a waiver form, please.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.310
Yes, ma'am.

31:43.190 --> 31:46.520
Our daughter would never murder her own brother ever.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.400
Well, theresa told me 

31:48.400 --> 31:50.630
that she didn't think of sergei as her actual brother.

31:50.630 --> 31:51.480
And you know what?

31:51.480 --> 31:52.200
I believe her.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.750
How can you do this to us after all we've been through?

31:54.750 --> 31:59.220
Look, if you want to stay here while i interview your daughter, 

31:59.220 --> 32:02.260
i need you and your wife to initial the marked areas 

32:02.260 --> 32:04.340
and sign on the bottom or leave.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.830
This explains your rights.

32:05.830 --> 32:07.660
Theresa, you recognize this fender?

32:07.660 --> 32:09.660
I didn't do anything to sergei.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.040
Are you suggesting that theresa ran over our son?

32:12.040 --> 32:13.570
Sir, sign the forms or leave!

32:13.570 --> 32:16.490
There's no in between!

32:16.800 --> 32:20.790
Let's look underneath the fender, please.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.800
On the underside -- 

32:22.800 --> 32:24.150
see this waffle pattern?

32:24.150 --> 32:28.640
Someone was trying to pound the fender back into shape.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.120
This is from sergei's scalp -- 

32:31.120 --> 32:33.630
the skin from one of the bludgeoning wounds that killed him!

32:33.630 --> 32:34.200
Get it away from me!

32:34.200 --> 32:35.430
Get it away from me, mom!

32:35.430 --> 32:36.260
Mom!

32:36.260 --> 32:39.020
You will notice that the waffle pattern on the epidermis of the wound matches 

32:39.020 --> 32:40.640
exactly the one on the car.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.420
I will not let you continue t-t-to treat us like -- 

32:43.420 --> 32:47.710
this is disgusting and unfair to my daughter.
-How can you show this to us?!

32:47.710 --> 32:51.090
To prove the same tool that was used on your daughter's car 

32:51.090 --> 32:53.770
was also used to kill your son.

32:55.230 --> 32:56.880
That is the mark that this hammer makes.

32:56.880 --> 33:00.750
Sergei was using one just like it to hammer out the dents in theresa's car.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.730
She came out to the garage while he was using it, 

33:02.730 --> 33:04.780
grabbed it from his hand, and killed him.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.010
-What?!
-Brian, stop this.

33:06.010 --> 33:07.240
Sergei cut your hair.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.130
He killed your cat.

33:08.130 --> 33:09.910
He stole your car and wrecked it.

33:09.910 --> 33:11.020
And in a fit of anger, 

33:11.020 --> 33:13.810
you jerked this from his hand and smashed his head in!

33:13.810 --> 33:14.760
I have a witness!

33:14.760 --> 33:15.530
I never wanted sergei to...

33:15.530 --> 33:16.330
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:16.410 --> 33:17.090
You have a witness?

33:17.090 --> 33:19.690
You have a witness who saw theresa kill my son?

33:19.690 --> 33:23.160
He puts her in the garage while the hammer was being used.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.140
And theresa left two threatening messages on sergei's cellphone 

33:26.140 --> 33:27.830
yesterday at 7:00 in the morning, 

33:27.830 --> 33:29.520
saying she intended to kill him.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.980
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.680
Theresa made those calls after sergei was already dead.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.970
How do you know when he died?

33:37.140 --> 33:41.420
We were never able to establish a time of death.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.850
But you bring up an excellent point.

33:48.850 --> 33:51.310
Only people who thought sergei was still alive 

33:51.310 --> 33:55.240
would bother calling him on his cell.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.060
There were two messages from theresa and one from jason hetner, 

33:58.060 --> 34:00.430
but not one from you or your wife.

34:00.430 --> 34:01.150
And why?

34:01.150 --> 34:04.700
Because you knew he wouldn't answer!

34:08.949 --> 34:09.860
Dad?

34:09.860 --> 34:11.870
Dad, what is she talking about?

34:11.870 --> 34:13.380
It's okay.

34:13.380 --> 34:18.050
Lieutenant tao, would you please escort theresa out of the room?

34:19.900 --> 34:22.659
Come with me, dear.

34:23.310 --> 34:25.300
Go ahead, honey.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.820
We'll be out in a minute.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.219
Go ahead.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.260
-It's okay.
-This way.

34:44.090 --> 34:45.070
So, sit down.

34:45.070 --> 34:47.449
Let's talk.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.170
You called 911.

34:51.170 --> 34:54.989
You thought that someone would just pop over and take a quick report.

34:54.989 --> 34:57.230
You were stunned at our reaction.

34:57.230 --> 35:00.810
You came down here to find out how close we were to actually finding something.

35:00.810 --> 35:05.920
You did everything you could to point us in the direction of jason.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.470
Well, those games are over now.

35:08.470 --> 35:13.400
Which one of you is the monster that killed your own son?

35:20.680 --> 35:24.820
Sergei was the monster.

35:24.820 --> 35:31.190
Killing that dog was only the last in a long list of horrible, horrible things -- 

35:31.190 --> 35:37.090
a list that starts with stuffing his pet hamsters in the garbage disposal, 

35:37.090 --> 35:38.980
cutting up squirrels, 

35:38.980 --> 35:40.560
killing cats, 

35:40.560 --> 35:42.340
stepping on baby birds.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.970
And i...

35:44.970 --> 35:48.170
I thought we could work with him, 

35:48.170 --> 35:50.290
and i tried.

35:50.290 --> 35:52.470
We took him to anger camps, 

35:52.470 --> 35:54.340
to psychiatrists.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.690
We sent him to boarding school, 

35:55.690 --> 35:57.810
to -- to a military academy.

35:57.810 --> 35:59.970
We even tried to return him to russia, 

35:59.970 --> 36:01.140
and they wouldn't take him back.

36:01.140 --> 36:02.670
Susan, we can't hide what happened.

36:02.670 --> 36:05.760
No, no, she does not understand!

36:05.760 --> 36:10.080
Sergei's aggression was created by his biological mother, 

36:10.080 --> 36:13.730
who abandoned him, or it was genetics or...

36:13.730 --> 36:16.710
I mean, where else does that sort of violence come from?

36:16.710 --> 36:21.240
Maybe from parents who smashed him in the head with a hammer.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.680
Which one of you did that, or did you both have a swing?

36:23.680 --> 36:26.010
Is it not clear?

36:26.010 --> 36:31.140
There was something wrong with him.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.250
Look, i get it.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.060
Sergei was a little psycho.

36:39.060 --> 36:40.720
And he was growing up fast.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.110
And you didn't plan on actually killing him, 

36:44.110 --> 36:46.950
which is what makes this more a crime of passion.

36:46.950 --> 36:49.150
And you were concerned for your daughter's life.

36:49.150 --> 36:52.460
I mean, isn't that why you put the dead bolt on her door?

36:52.460 --> 36:57.400
Yes.Yes.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.310
Exactly, and last night after taft -- 

36:59.310 --> 37:03.940
we went into the garage after we saw that poor dog lying in the yard.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.100
And i grabbed sergei, and i pulled him out from under the car.

37:06.100 --> 37:10.310
And i demanded to know if he killed ralphie.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.990
And he just...

37:14.380 --> 37:17.770
He just laughed.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.300
So i grabbed the hammer, and...

37:21.300 --> 37:22.200
I hit him.

37:22.200 --> 37:26.640
I don't -- i was so angry that i don't even think i knew what i was doing.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.510
It was -- i...

37:30.510 --> 37:35.270
That's right, you were very mad the first time you hit him.

37:35.270 --> 37:39.080
But then you hit him again.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.420
There were two blows to the skull.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.980
Now, the first one wasn't hard enough, 

37:43.980 --> 37:44.620
but the second one was.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.920
It wasn't hard at all -- not for me.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.370
Very hard for sergei, yes, but not for me, no.

37:50.370 --> 37:53.750
And then i -- i looked up at susan.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.080
Brian – 

37:57.120 --> 37:57.700
Now, wait a minute, ma'am.

37:57.700 --> 37:58.990
Are you involved in this crime?

37:58.990 --> 37:59.980
Did you participate with your husband?

37:59.980 --> 38:00.930
She was screaming at me to stop, 

38:00.930 --> 38:03.220
but it just didn't register somehow.

38:03.220 --> 38:06.470
I think maybe i was so surprised after i hit him the first time, 

38:06.470 --> 38:11.940
because it was -- it was over before i made the decision, really.

38:12.300 --> 38:19.250
And then i just -- i saw sergei lying there, and i thought,

38:19.250 --> 38:21.920
 "he's not mine." 

38:22.250 --> 38:27.130
"he's -- he's not part of me." 

38:27.380 --> 38:30.190
and then while susan was yelling for me to stop, 

38:30.190 --> 38:34.280
i swung that hammer down as hard as i could.

38:35.670 --> 38:36.950
Then i wrapped him up in an old blanket, 

38:36.950 --> 38:39.720
and i took him to where he liked to go the most, 

38:39.720 --> 38:43.210
which is...A drain -- 

38:43.210 --> 38:45.050
a sewage drain.

38:45.050 --> 38:48.880
A fitting resting place, i thought.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.620
And then i dumped the hammer and went home.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.270
And i thought, 

38:53.270 --> 38:59.720
"wow, we have our family back, finally." 

39:00.740 --> 39:03.860
and you tell me, chief johnson, 

39:03.860 --> 39:07.740
what would you do if you were responsible for sergei?

39:08.960 --> 39:09.940
As it so happens, 

39:09.940 --> 39:13.060
i am responsible for him.

39:13.400 --> 39:18.400
And what i can do is put you under arrest for the murder of your son.

39:44.310 --> 39:47.890
So, we couldn't have prevented sergei's murder?

39:47.890 --> 39:51.250
No, no, he was dead before we got the call.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.320
So, here's the deal.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.460
From now on, we get a critical missing, 

39:54.460 --> 39:58.720
for 72 hours we search around the clock with every available resource 

39:58.720 --> 40:02.860
until we either find the child or the body.

40:02.860 --> 40:03.980
No exceptions.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.110
If that's a policy amendment, 

40:05.110 --> 40:08.240
you won't get any argument from me.

40:08.970 --> 40:11.140
Okay.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.700
Oh, and, uh...

40:13.700 --> 40:19.280
If you would extend my personal apology to fritz, 

40:19.280 --> 40:21.680
i'd appreciate it.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.500
Absolutely.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.640
Well, tell the pope i accept his apology, 

40:32.640 --> 40:35.340
because i'm gracious.

40:36.290 --> 40:38.970
I hate it when they forget to put in that hot mustard.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.390
Why do i never ask for it?

40:40.390 --> 40:43.240
Because you're too gracious.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.970
Look what i have.

40:47.970 --> 40:51.980
Oh, a brochure.

40:52.220 --> 40:54.070
The hollywood hills.

40:54.070 --> 40:57.700
House is between my shoes and the tissue box, 

40:57.700 --> 41:00.670
or your work and mine.

41:00.670 --> 41:06.460
Two bedrooms, office, pool, great views.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.530
I take it, then, 

41:11.530 --> 41:16.320
you're not interested in what school district we buy into?

41:16.730 --> 41:21.500
I don't think we need to worry about schools, really.

41:25.700 --> 41:28.110
I see.

41:31.120 --> 41:37.050
So, unless you absolutely have your heart set on a bigger place...

41:38.840 --> 41:42.600
Well, i -- i go back and forth, 

41:42.600 --> 41:46.180
but a bigger place -- 

41:46.180 --> 41:49.960
that needs to be something we both want.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.560
Maybe in this case......

41:55.430 --> 41:58.320
Small is better.
