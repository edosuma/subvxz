into them eventually.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.469
And of course they
got back together.
They have a whole baby.

just expecting...

look great.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.959

dodged that bullet, girl.

get messy enough,

15:32.765 --> 15:36.393

And y'all know how hard
it was for me to let him go.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.242
And then...

15:52.326 --> 15:54.370

I didn't even reach out.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.830
You made the smart choice.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.540
But why was it
the smart choice?

15:58.624 --> 16:01.168

to be somebody's stepmom.

but...

16:04.755 --> 16:06.548

16:06.632 --> 16:08.175
It just has to make
sense to you.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.468

to be the smart choice

16:09.551 --> 16:11.303

You know, I know this
last year has been a lot
for both of us, and, uh,

19:51.273 --> 19:57.112
hasn't always felt easy,
or felt good, or...

you know, if things
had gone different,

wouldn't be here, and...

20:06.955 --> 20:09.249

that ever happened to me.

and, um...

20:30.228 --> 20:33.357

wasn't good...

20:34.900 --> 20:37.319

thought about, um--

20:44.868 --> 20:46.078
I'm sorry.

bad about that.

I know you've
given up a lot.

you to be miserable--
-I'm not.

blame you for anything.
