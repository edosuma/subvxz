===MUTANT X Whose Woods These Are / s02.ep04===

00:09.881 --> 00:11.483
FOUR KILLINGS IN SIX WEEKS.

00:11.882 --> 00:14.283
ADD IN THREE SIGHTINGS OF A
MYSTERIOUS CREATURE IN THE SAME

00:14.283 --> 00:16.283
TIME PERIOD AND WELCOME
TO "BIGFOOT FEVER".

00:16.283 --> 00:17.885
YOU KNOW,
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY ADAM SENT US OUT HERE.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.885
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THESE
DISAPPEARANCES HAVE ANYTHING

00:19.885 --> 00:21.487
TO DO WITH NEW MUTANT ACTIVITY.

00:21.487 --> 00:23.488
YEAH, WELL, ONCE YOU START
QUESTIONING WHERE ADAM GETS HIS

00:23.887 --> 00:25.888
INSIDE INFORMATION, WE'RE
TALKING SOME SERIOUS MYSTERY.

00:25.888 --> 00:28.290
WELL, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICE, BLIND TRUST IS NOT MY

00:28.290 --> 00:30.691
FAVOURITE COURSE
OF ACTION, OKAY?

00:35.493 --> 00:38.295
STACY, TURN OFF THE CAMERA.

00:38.295 --> 00:40.296
I MEAN, CAN WE
JUST ENJOY THE WALK HERE?

00:40.296 --> 00:43.897
OKAY,
WE GOTTA GO THIS WAY.

00:43.897 --> 00:51.900
WE ARE NOW GOING OFF THE TRAIL.

00:53.501 --> 00:55.103
HI, STACY.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.503
NOW, WOULD YOU
PUT THAT CAMERA AWAY AND
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

00:57.503 --> 00:58.304
WHY?

00:58.704 --> 00:59.904
I WANT TO GET THIS.

00:59.904 --> 01:01.905
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE GET
A MONSTER IN THESE MOUNTAINS.

01:01.905 --> 01:06.308
IT WAS PROBABLY
A PACK OF WOLVES.

01:06.308 --> 01:09.909
WEREWOLVES.

01:09.909 --> 01:13.911
OR A BEAR OR SOMETHING.

01:14.311 --> 01:17.912
DEFINITELY NOT HUMAN.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.514
OKAY, LOOK, ARE WE
HIKING OR MAKING MOVIES?

01:19.514 --> 01:21.514
BECAUSE I'M READY TO START BACK.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.515
COME ON, YOU SAID YOU'D SHOW
ME WHERE THEY FOUND THE BODIES.

01:23.515 --> 01:25.916
THEN WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.

01:25.916 --> 01:28.718
WHAT?

01:28.718 --> 01:30.719
IT... IT'S LIKE A
THREE-MILE HIKE FROM HERE.

01:30.719 --> 01:33.920
MAYBE IT WAS A WITCH.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.922
I'D JUST LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE TO MATT'S MOTHER.

01:37.922 --> 01:39.923
I... I'M SO SORRY.

01:40.323 --> 01:43.525
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

01:43.525 --> 01:49.128
GET OVER THERE.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.132 --> 02:03.134
HO, HO. NICE.

02:03.534 --> 02:07.136
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY
THIS THING'S A MAN-EATER.

02:07.136 --> 02:10.336
DOES THAT MEAN I'M SAFE?

02:10.336 --> 02:13.938
NOT FROM ME.

02:37.550 --> 02:39.151
AGHHH... AGHHHH...

02:39.151 --> 02:41.152
AGHHH... !

02:41.152 --> 02:49.156
NO, NO... !

04:06.925 --> 04:08.125
HEY, SHAL.

04:08.525 --> 04:10.526
WHAT'S UP?

04:10.526 --> 04:14.128
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LET
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE CARRY GUNS.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.529
DO YOU... DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING ON YOUR END?

04:16.529 --> 04:21.331
NOT REALLY.

04:25.733 --> 04:30.535
WHAT'S UP?

04:30.535 --> 04:35.338
HEY, YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME OR JUST IGNORE ME?

04:35.338 --> 04:39.739
SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY
OUT THERE, BRENNAN.

04:43.341 --> 04:44.943
AGGHHH... AGGHHH.

04:44.943 --> 04:46.143
AGHHH... !

04:49.344 --> 04:51.345
THIS IS AWFUL.

04:51.345 --> 04:53.346
YEAH, BUT THE QUESTION
IS, "IS IT REAL?" IT'S REAL.

04:53.346 --> 04:54.947
I MEAN, IT'S GOT TO BE.

04:54.947 --> 04:56.547
NO ONE COULD
FAKE THAT KIND OF FEAR.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.548
BRENNAN, SHALIMAR,
WHAT'S YOUR SENSE?

04:58.949 --> 05:00.950
THAT EMMA'S RIGHT.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.550
IT'S REAL.

05:02.550 --> 05:05.352
AND I THINK WHOEVER KILLED
THOSE KIDS WAS A NEW MUTANT.

05:05.352 --> 05:07.752
I DON'T KNOW, SHAL.

05:12.956 --> 05:15.756
FREEZE THE IMAGE RIGHT THERE.

05:15.756 --> 05:19.358
ZOOM IN. ENHANCE.

05:19.358 --> 05:21.359
SEE? HIS EYES ARE GLOWING.

05:21.359 --> 05:22.960
I TELL YOU, HE'S A NEW MUTANT.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.560
AW, COME ON.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.561
THAT COULD BE THE WAY THE
LIGHT'S REFLECTING OFF OF IT,

05:26.561 --> 05:27.762
IT COULD BE A VIDEO GLITCH.

05:27.762 --> 05:28.963
WHO KNOWS?

05:29.363 --> 05:30.163
HMM...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.764
YOU ASK ME, IT'S A BEAR.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.365
IT'S NOT A BEAR.

05:33.365 --> 05:34.966
I'M INCLINED TO AGREE.

05:34.966 --> 05:36.967
ADAM, WE'RE NOT IN THE ANIMAL
CONTROL BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

05:36.967 --> 05:38.567
YOGI HAD A BAD DAY, CASE CLOSED.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.368
WELL, BRENNAN, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE
TO PROVE YOUR THEORY.

05:41.368 --> 05:43.769
YOU ARE
SHALIMAR ARE GOING TO STAY
ON THE SCENE TO INVESTIGATE.

05:43.769 --> 05:46.171
I DON'T DO NATURE.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.172
WELL, IF YOU'RE TOO SCARED, I'M
SURE JESSE'D BE WILLING TO...

05:48.172 --> 05:50.173
WHOA, WAIT, SCARED
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

05:50.173 --> 05:50.973
GOOD.

05:51.373 --> 05:52.573
THEN IT'S SETTLED.

05:52.974 --> 05:54.175
A COUPLE OF DAYS OUT IN
THE FRESH AIR'LL DO YOU GOOD.

05:54.574 --> 05:56.175
AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
OUT THERE, YOU LET US KNOW.

05:56.575 --> 05:57.776
SEND YOU WHATEVER
BACKUP YOU NEED.

05:58.176 --> 06:00.177
FORGET THE BACKUP.

06:00.177 --> 06:03.379
I'D SETTLE FOR A WEEKEND
AT THE DOWNTOWN FOUR SEASONS.

06:03.379 --> 06:05.380
OH, YOU CAN TAKE THE
BOY OUT OF THE CITY, BUT...

06:05.380 --> 06:08.181
AHEM.

06:10.182 --> 06:13.783
WELL, IT'LL BE QUITE THE RUG
FOR IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE,

06:13.783 --> 06:14.984
WHOEVER BAGS IT.

06:14.984 --> 06:16.185
PLANNING ON SHOOTING HIM?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.186
WELL, SOMEBODY HAS TO.

06:18.186 --> 06:19.386
IT'S A KILLER.

06:19.386 --> 06:21.387
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
PROTECTING HIS TERRITORY.

06:21.387 --> 06:22.988
WHAT, ARE YOU A TREE-HUGGER?

06:22.988 --> 06:24.188
ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST.

06:24.188 --> 06:25.389
COME ON, SHAL.

06:25.389 --> 06:26.990
YEAH, WELL, I'M AN ACTIVIST TOO

06:26.990 --> 06:28.590
-- FOR THE PARENTS OF
THE KIDS THAT THING SLAUGHTERED.

06:28.590 --> 06:30.992
YEAH.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.592
YOU GUYS UP HERE
TO TRY AND STUDY THE BEAST?

06:32.592 --> 06:34.193
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

06:34.193 --> 06:35.793
MY NAME'S GRADY.

06:36.194 --> 06:37.394
SHALIMAR.

06:37.794 --> 06:38.996
BRENNAN.

06:38.996 --> 06:40.996
SO YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THE HUNTERS?

06:40.996 --> 06:42.597
NO.

06:42.597 --> 06:44.198
I'M A CRYPTOZOOLOGIST.

06:44.198 --> 06:46.999
WE STUDY HIDDEN ANIMALS, NEW
SPECIES YET TO BE DISCOVERED.

06:46.999 --> 06:49.400
HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL GET
A LOOK AT IT BEFORE ONE OF THOSE

06:49.400 --> 06:52.201
YOKELS GOES GUN CRAZY ON IT.

06:52.201 --> 06:58.204
NOT IF WE GET THERE FIRST.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.607
MAYBE THIS IS SOMEHOW RELATED
TO MODERN-DAY LORE, YOU KNOW,

07:04.607 --> 07:07.408
SOMETHING AKIN TO
YETI OR SASQUATCH SIGHTINGS.

07:07.808 --> 07:10.610
HEY, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

07:10.610 --> 07:13.011
THERE'S FOUR REPORTED ATTACKS.

07:13.011 --> 07:14.611
THERE'S ONE MORE.

07:14.611 --> 07:17.413
I JUST RECOVERED A DELETED
FILE FROM THE POLICE DATABASE.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.014
ANOTHER KILLING?

07:19.414 --> 07:21.415
NO.

07:21.415 --> 07:27.018
THIS GUY SURVIVED.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.423
IT'S AMAZING UP HERE.

07:39.423 --> 07:41.424
THE AIR IS JUST SO ALIVE.

07:41.824 --> 07:43.025
YEAH, WHATEVER.

07:43.425 --> 07:45.026
SURE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH?

07:45.426 --> 07:47.427
YEP.

07:53.829 --> 07:56.631
POSITIVE.

08:03.434 --> 08:04.635
THIS IS WEIRD.

08:04.635 --> 08:06.236
WHAT IS IT?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.237
IT'S HUMAN HAIR, BUT EVERYTHING
ELSE I'VE BEEN PICKING

08:08.237 --> 08:14.639
UP ON HAS BEEN ANIMAL.

08:22.243 --> 08:28.246
HEY--  DON'T.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.048
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO END
UP AS THIS GUY'S DESSERT, OKAY?

08:43.053 --> 08:45.054
LET'S GO.

08:45.054 --> 08:46.254
NO, WAIT.

08:46.654 --> 08:47.855
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME BLAST HIM?

08:47.855 --> 08:49.456
BECAUSE HE'S NOT OUR KILLER.

08:49.456 --> 08:51.057
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:51.057 --> 08:53.857
I ASKED HIM.

08:53.857 --> 08:57.060
HUH.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.461
SO WHY WOULD THE POLICE
WANT TO COVER THIS UP?

09:01.461 --> 09:03.462
NO, SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT DELETED THE FILE.

09:03.462 --> 09:06.264
WELL,
HIS NAME'S NATHANIEL BLOCK,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL I GOT.

09:06.264 --> 09:08.265
IT'S LIKE HE DIDN'T
EVEN EXIST BEFORE THE ATTACK.

09:08.265 --> 09:10.266
SOMEONE TRIED
TO ERASE HIS IDENTITY?

09:10.266 --> 09:11.466
AND NEARLY SUCCEEDED.

09:11.866 --> 09:13.467
AH, BUT NOT QUITE.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.068
ACCORDING TO
THE ADMISSION RECORDS,

09:15.068 --> 09:17.868
HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO
A VETERANS HOSPITAL UPSTATE.

09:17.868 --> 09:19.470
BETTER CHECK THE VISITING HOURS.

09:19.470 --> 09:24.272
COME ON.

09:55.087 --> 09:58.288
HE'S CLOSE.

09:58.288 --> 10:01.489
HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE.

10:01.889 --> 10:03.890
YOU SURE IT'S NOT
YOUR FRIEND, THE BEAR?

10:03.890 --> 10:06.691
NO.

10:06.691 --> 10:09.093
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

10:09.093 --> 10:12.294
I'VE NEVER SENSED
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

10:12.694 --> 10:14.695
IT'S... IT'S FAMILIAR,
BUT IT'S SO...

10:14.695 --> 10:17.097
DIFFERENT.

10:18.697 --> 10:20.298
OH.

10:20.298 --> 10:22.299
DAMN.

10:22.299 --> 10:25.100
COME ON.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.101
LET ME SEE THOSE BUG BITES.

10:27.101 --> 10:28.302
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

10:28.702 --> 10:30.303
SUCK THE POISON OUT OF THEM?

10:30.303 --> 10:31.903
GONNA TAKE ME TO DINNER FIRST?

10:35.105 --> 10:36.705
IT'S PEPPERMINT.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.306
IT'S A NATURAL BUG REPELLANT.

10:38.306 --> 10:42.708
WELL, I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
TOLD ME THAT BEFORE I GOT BIT.

10:43.908 --> 10:46.310
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

10:52.313 --> 10:55.514
DOWN THERE,
ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS.

10:55.914 --> 10:57.115
ALL RIGHT.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.316
I'LL TAKE HIM HEAD ON.

10:58.715 --> 11:00.317
YOU GO AROUND THE BACK.

11:49.939 --> 11:51.940
SHAL!

12:00.744 --> 12:02.345
UGH.

12:02.745 --> 12:04.346
UGH, UGH, UGH...

12:04.346 --> 12:07.947
AGH!

12:08.748 --> 12:09.948
SHALIMAR?!

12:09.948 --> 12:11.150
AGH...

12:11.150 --> 12:13.550
AGH.

12:13.550 --> 12:14.751
OUF.

12:14.751 --> 12:16.752
UGH!

12:58.771 --> 13:04.374
HEY, YOU OKAY?

13:04.374 --> 13:07.176
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

13:07.575 --> 13:10.777
HE'S ONE OF US.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.614
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
SENT ME OFF ON PURPOSE.

13:19.614 --> 13:22.016
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN TAKE
THIS CREATURE DOWN ON YOUR OWN?

13:22.016 --> 13:23.616
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

13:23.616 --> 13:26.018
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM
AND GET HIM BACK TO SANCTUARY.

13:26.018 --> 13:27.618
SHWEW, IF WE CAN.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.619
YOU'D KILL HIM
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

13:29.619 --> 13:30.820
IF THAT'S WHAT
I HAD TO DO, YEAH.

13:31.220 --> 13:32.821
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM.

13:33.221 --> 13:40.825
HE'S CONFUSED, AND HE'S IN PAIN,
AND HE'S A FERAL - LIKE ME.

13:40.825 --> 13:42.025
HUH.

13:42.025 --> 13:44.026
NO, HE'S NOTHING LIKE YOU.

13:44.026 --> 13:45.626
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE HE WAS.

13:46.027 --> 13:48.428
MAYBE THIS IS MY FUTURE.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.229
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
SUDDENLY MUTATE INTO THAT?

13:51.229 --> 13:52.429
NO, NOT SUDDENLY.

13:52.429 --> 13:53.630
SLOWLY.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.631
WE'RE ALL STILL
MUTATING, YOU KNOW.

13:55.631 --> 13:57.232
YOU KNOW IT COULD BE TRUE.

13:57.632 --> 14:00.834
SCARES YOU.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.034
HEY, WAIT.

14:02.434 --> 14:03.634
UGH!

14:03.634 --> 14:06.036
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE BLEEDING.

14:06.036 --> 14:07.636
OH, HE REALLY CLAWED YOU.

14:07.636 --> 14:08.838
IT'S NOTHING.

14:08.838 --> 14:10.839
DON'T...

14:18.042 --> 14:18.842
WHAT?

14:19.242 --> 14:20.843
WHAT, IS HE COMING BACK?

14:20.843 --> 14:23.244
I DON'T KNOW.

14:23.644 --> 14:25.645
SOMETHING'S OUT THERE.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.646
OKAY.

14:27.646 --> 14:28.847
OKAY, YOU STAY HERE.

14:28.847 --> 14:30.047
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK IT OUT.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.849
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.055
I HEARD NOISES.

14:46.055 --> 14:48.056
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

14:48.056 --> 14:49.656
YOU DIDN'T?

14:50.057 --> 14:54.458
I JUST GOT HERE.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.862
YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:00.862 --> 15:04.063
TAKING PICTURES?

15:04.063 --> 15:06.464
NOT YET.

15:06.464 --> 15:08.866
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN UNDISCOVERED SPECIES.

15:08.866 --> 15:13.267
PHOTOS COULD BE PRICELESS.

15:32.877 --> 15:35.277
AN OLD HUNTER'S TRICK.

15:35.277 --> 15:38.079
IF YOU WERE THAT FREAKISH
THING, YOU'D ALREADY BE DEAD.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.080
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
UNDERESTIMATING HIM.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.281
AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY
UNDERESTIMATING ME.

15:43.281 --> 15:45.282
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
OUT HERE, NONE OF YOU.

15:45.282 --> 15:46.883
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:46.883 --> 15:48.884
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

15:48.884 --> 15:50.885
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING
TO BLOW IT AWAY, RIGHT?

15:50.885 --> 15:53.286
PRETTY BRAVE, HIDING
BEHIND YOUR HEAVY ARTILLERY.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.487
OUT HERE, LIFE IS SIMPLE.

15:56.487 --> 16:00.089
THERE'S YOUR PREDATOR,
AND YOUR PREY.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.891
I PROMISE YOU, I MAKE
IT A HABIT TO BE THE PREDATOR.

16:02.891 --> 16:04.491
PREDATOR?

16:04.491 --> 16:08.493
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A LITTLE MAN WITH A BIG GUN.

16:08.893 --> 16:12.095
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THESE
WOODS THAT'S GOING TO TEACH

16:12.095 --> 16:18.898
YOU WHAT
A PREDATOR REALLY IS, SOMETHING
THAT DESERVES THE NAME.

16:18.898 --> 16:21.299
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

16:21.299 --> 16:23.700
YOU FOOL AROUND OUT HERE ANY
LONGER AND THAT THING'S GOING

16:23.700 --> 16:26.101
TO TEAR YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD RIGHT OFF.

16:26.101 --> 16:30.904
YOU WANT TO PROTECT SOMETHING,
START WITH YOUR OWN HIDE.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.908
ACCORDING TO
THE BUILDING PLAN, SECURITY
WING'S ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

16:40.908 --> 16:42.508
BARS, ARMED GUARDS, ALARMS.

16:42.508 --> 16:44.509
HARDLY YOUR AVERAGE PSYCH WARD.

16:44.509 --> 16:46.911
AT LEAST WE WON'T BE BORED.

16:51.713 --> 16:55.315
UGH... HUH...

16:55.315 --> 16:57.316
SHAL, YOU OKAY?

16:57.316 --> 17:01.317
YEAH, JUST DIDN'T
GET MUCH SLEEP.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.923
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

17:12.923 --> 17:15.324
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

17:15.324 --> 17:17.724
THANKS.

17:17.724 --> 17:20.526
YOU'RE WARM.

17:20.526 --> 17:22.527
I'M FINE.

17:22.527 --> 17:23.727
SHAL, YOU'RE REALLY...

17:23.727 --> 17:25.728
HEY, I'M OKAY.

17:26.128 --> 17:32.132
ALL RIGHT.

17:42.536 --> 17:43.737
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:43.737 --> 17:45.338
GET SOME REST.

17:45.338 --> 17:46.538
I'M GOING TO TALK TO GRADY.

17:46.939 --> 17:48.940
I SAW HIM HANGING AROUND
WHERE WE FOUGHT THAT BEAST.

17:48.940 --> 17:50.941
HE HAD A CAMERA.

17:50.941 --> 17:54.142
DO YOU THINK HE CAUGHT
US USING OUR POWERS?

17:54.142 --> 17:57.343
WELL, IF HE DID, HE'S
NOT GOING TO DEVELOP THE FILM.

18:26.157 --> 18:29.758
RIGHT, ONE PANIC
ATTACK COMING UP.

18:39.363 --> 18:41.764
NICE WORK.

18:52.169 --> 18:54.971
WAIT. THIS WAY.

19:19.781 --> 19:22.183
248-D.

19:26.185 --> 19:28.986
NATHANIEL BLOCK?

19:47.394 --> 19:50.196
LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

19:50.196 --> 19:51.796
YEAH.

19:51.796 --> 19:54.198
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN GET.

20:40.219 --> 20:42.220
AGGHHH...!

20:44.621 --> 20:47.822
BRENNAN?

21:10.233 --> 21:11.833
I'M IN SECTOR
FOXTROT, TWENTY-ONE,

21:12.234 --> 21:13.834
QUADRANT FOUR-THREE-THREE.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.636
POINT OF THE LAST KNOWN CONTACT,
RECOVERING TRACE EVIDENCE.

21:16.636 --> 21:19.037
YES, SIR.

21:19.037 --> 21:21.038
HIS EXIT WAS IN A SOUTH-WESTERLY
DIRECTION FROM THE SITE.

21:21.438 --> 21:24.639
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

21:29.442 --> 21:31.443
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:31.443 --> 21:33.444
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

21:33.444 --> 21:35.045
I WAS ABOUT TO
ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

21:35.445 --> 21:38.246
I WAS JUST SEARCHING THE AREA.

21:38.246 --> 21:41.447
OH, THAT'S SOME PRETTY
FANCY EQUIPMENT FOR A ZOOLOGIST.

21:41.447 --> 21:43.448
HEY, GET OUT OF MY BAG.

21:43.448 --> 21:45.049
WHOOF.

21:45.049 --> 21:47.450
LIKE I SAID, SOME
PRETTY FANCY EQUIPMENT.

21:47.450 --> 21:49.451
WELL, THE BEAST
MIGHT BE DANGEROUS.

21:49.451 --> 21:52.652
IT'S, UH, MERELY
A TRANQUILIZER GUN.

21:53.053 --> 21:57.055
SEE, I KNOW TRANK
GUNS AND THIS IS NOTHING
I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

21:57.055 --> 22:01.057
MAYBE IT'S NOT.

22:01.457 --> 22:05.059
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO FEEL ITS EFFECT?

22:05.059 --> 22:07.459
WHO ARE YOU AND
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:07.459 --> 22:09.460
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HINT?

22:09.860 --> 22:11.861
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
AND STAY OUT OF MINE.

22:12.262 --> 22:15.063
OH, WELL, MAYBE MY BUSINESS IS
GETTING ALL OVER YOUR BUSINESS.

23:33.799 --> 23:37.001
UGH... UGH!

23:41.403 --> 23:43.804
SHOOT HIM!

23:43.804 --> 23:44.604
GIVE ME THE GUN!

23:44.604 --> 23:46.206
SHOOT HIM!

23:46.206 --> 23:48.207
WAIT!

23:48.207 --> 23:52.608
UGH.

24:09.416 --> 24:13.418
WHY DIDN'T HE GO FOR YOU?

24:13.418 --> 24:14.618
I DON'T KNOW.

24:14.618 --> 24:16.220
MAYBE HE RECOGNIZED
SOMETHING IN ME.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.820
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

24:17.820 --> 24:20.221
TURNS OUT HE'S AS
MUCH OF A ZOOLOGIST AS I AM.

24:20.221 --> 24:22.222
SO OUR ANIMAL LOVING SCIENTIST,

24:22.222 --> 24:24.223
HE'S JUST A
HUNTER AFTER ALL, HUH?

24:24.223 --> 24:26.624
BUT WE'RE ALL
AFTER THE SAME THING.

24:26.624 --> 24:28.625
GIVE ME BACK MY GUN.

24:29.025 --> 24:30.226
YEAH, RIGHT.

24:30.226 --> 24:32.227
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO WITH HIM?

24:32.627 --> 24:33.827
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH ME?

24:33.827 --> 24:37.028
I'M GOING AFTER HIM.

25:05.842 --> 25:07.843
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

25:08.244 --> 25:13.045
PROJECT 318 IS A SECRET
OFFSHOOT OF THE SPACE PROGRAM.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.247
HE'S AN EXPERIMENT, A FERAL
THEY ACQUIRED FROM GENOMEX.

25:16.247 --> 25:18.648
THEY SOUPED UP HIS ANIMAL DNA?

25:18.648 --> 25:23.451
YEAH, THEY WERE GOING TO SPLICE
IN ELEMENTAL AND MOLECULAR

25:23.451 --> 25:25.451
GENES AS WELL,
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

25:25.451 --> 25:26.652
THEN WHY IS HE LIKE THIS?

25:26.652 --> 25:28.253
I DON'T KNOW.

25:28.253 --> 25:30.654
WHAT WERE THEY AFTER?

25:30.654 --> 25:31.854
THERE.

25:31.854 --> 25:34.256
THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE
AN ASTRONAUT WHO COULD WITHSTAND

25:34.256 --> 25:35.856
ALIEN ENVIRONMENTS.

25:35.856 --> 25:37.457
I'M GOING TO DOWNLOAD
THE WHOLE DATABASE.

25:37.857 --> 25:41.859
WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME WITH IT.

25:42.659 --> 25:45.461
UH OH...

25:46.661 --> 25:48.262
AGGHHH...

25:48.262 --> 25:49.862
NATHANIEL, CALM DOWN.

25:49.862 --> 25:51.063
WE'RE NOT WITH THE HOSPITAL.

25:51.063 --> 25:53.064
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

26:12.273 --> 26:13.874
COME ON!

26:19.876 --> 26:22.278
I NEED TO REST A MINUTE.

26:22.678 --> 26:24.679
MAN, THIS GUY'S REALLY
STARTING TO ANNOY ME.

26:24.679 --> 26:26.280
YEAH, WHY SHOULD
WE WAIT FOR YOU?

26:26.680 --> 26:28.681
YOUR POWERS DIDN'T WORK
VERY WELL YESTERDAY, DID THEY?

26:28.681 --> 26:31.081
HUH?

26:31.081 --> 26:32.682
I KNOW WHAT KIND
OF FREAKS YOU ARE.

26:32.682 --> 26:34.683
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

26:34.683 --> 26:37.885
THE ONLY THING YOU'LL
BE GOOD FOR IS BAIT.

26:53.492 --> 26:55.893
MIKE... MIKE...

26:56.294 --> 26:57.894
IT'S OKAY.

26:57.894 --> 27:01.496
SHHH...

27:01.496 --> 27:07.098
MIKE...
- CALM DOWN.

27:11.900 --> 27:13.502
SLOW DOWN.

27:13.502 --> 27:15.102
I GOTTA STOP.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.503
I'VE GOT A FIRST
AID KIT IN MY BAG.

27:17.503 --> 27:21.105
AT LEAST YOU
CAN GIVE ME THAT, HUH?

27:21.105 --> 27:23.906
WHY DON'T
YOU START BY TELLING US WHAT
YOU WANT WITH THAT THING.

27:23.906 --> 27:26.308
I BET YOU TENSION BANDAGES
AND PAINKILLERS WOULD HELP

27:26.708 --> 27:28.309
WITH THAT LEG OF YOURS.

27:28.309 --> 27:29.909
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.510
WELL, THAT'S NICE.

27:31.510 --> 27:33.110
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM
A GUY THAT JUST TRIED TO KILL

27:33.110 --> 27:35.111
ME A FEW MINUTES AGO.

27:35.512 --> 27:37.112
WELL,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

27:37.112 --> 27:39.113
UH, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S
GOING TO BE BEFORE THAT THING

27:39.514 --> 27:41.515
COMES BACK THIS WAY, HUH?

27:47.117 --> 27:49.118
HE WAS AN EXPERIMENT.

27:49.118 --> 27:51.919
THE SPACE AGENCY.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.920
PROJECT 318.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.921
YOU CREATED A MUTANT?

27:55.921 --> 27:57.922
WE GOT HIM FROM GENOMEX.

27:57.922 --> 28:00.324
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE THE ULTIMATE ASTRONAUT.

28:00.324 --> 28:02.724
BUT HE GOT SICK.

28:03.124 --> 28:06.326
THE GENETIC MODIFICATIONS
CREATED SOME KIND OF VIRUS THAT

28:06.326 --> 28:09.127
STARTED CHANGING HIM.

28:09.127 --> 28:11.128
IT WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH
THAT YOU RUIN HIS LIFE,

28:11.128 --> 28:12.729
BUT YOU GOTTA
CREATE A PLAGUE, TOO?

28:13.129 --> 28:15.130
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

28:15.530 --> 28:24.335
IT'S ONLY INFECTIOUS
TO FERAL MUTANTS.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.336
SO THAT'S YOUR JOB?

28:26.735 --> 28:28.736
JUST TO MAKE
SURE NOBODY FINDS OUT?

28:28.736 --> 28:34.339
SO THIS FREAK THAT YOU HAVE
TO KILL, DOES HE HAVE A NAME?

28:34.739 --> 28:39.141
WARD. MICHAEL WARD.

28:44.744 --> 28:46.745
UGH!

28:46.745 --> 28:48.746
YOU OKAY?

28:48.746 --> 28:49.946
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:50.347 --> 28:51.547
YOU OKAY.

28:51.547 --> 28:53.147
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:01.952 --> 29:03.553
BRENNAN.

29:03.553 --> 29:06.754
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

29:06.754 --> 29:10.756
WE GOTTA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

29:12.757 --> 29:13.957
I WAS FEELING DIZZY.

29:13.957 --> 29:15.158
JUST LAY DOWN.

29:15.158 --> 29:16.359
LAY DOWN.

29:16.359 --> 29:17.559
OH,
MAN, YOU'RE BURNING UP.

29:17.959 --> 29:19.960
OH.

29:22.362 --> 29:26.763
WHATEVER TURNED
THAT CREATURE INTO WHAT HE IS,

29:27.163 --> 29:29.164
YOU'VE GOT IT.

29:36.034 --> 29:38.836
NOW, BASED ON THE BLOOD
WORK THAT YOU BEAMED ME,

29:38.836 --> 29:41.237
IT'S THE SAME VIRUS THAT NATE
BLOCK GOT FROM HIS FRIEND MIKE.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.838
OKAY, WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

29:43.237 --> 29:44.438
NOT SURE.

29:44.839 --> 29:46.840
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'D
BE BETTER OFF BACK HERE
IN THE LAB AT SANCTUARY.

29:47.239 --> 29:48.840
NO WAY, ADAM, NOT 'TIL
WE FIND MIKE AND HELP HIM.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.041
NO.

29:50.041 --> 29:52.042
YOUR SAFETY'S MORE
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

29:52.042 --> 29:53.643
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET THEM KILL HIM.

29:53.643 --> 29:55.243
I'M WORKING ON
A CURE FOR BOTH OF YOU.

29:55.243 --> 29:57.244
RIGHT NOW, I
WANT YOU TO AVOID HIM.

29:57.244 --> 30:00.045
WHATEVER RELATIONSHIP
YOU THINK YOU HAVE WITH HIM,

30:00.045 --> 30:01.647
HE IS SICK, HE IS SCARED.

30:02.046 --> 30:04.047
IF HE CORNERS
YOU, HE WILL KILL YOU.

30:04.047 --> 30:07.249
HOW LONG DO I HAVE?

30:07.249 --> 30:10.050
THE VIRUS ATTACKS THE
NERVE PATHWAYS TO THE CEREBRUM.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.651
IT DESTROYS BRAIN CELLS.

30:12.051 --> 30:14.452
SHALIMAR, RIGHT NOW, I HAVE
NO IDEA HOW IT'LL AFFECT YOUR

30:14.452 --> 30:16.453
SPECIFIC METABOLISM.

30:16.453 --> 30:18.054
ANSWER MY QUESTION, ADAM.

30:18.054 --> 30:27.258
WE MAY NOT HAVE
MORE THAN ANOTHER DAY.

30:30.059 --> 30:34.461
ADAM!

30:37.663 --> 30:42.065
NATE... NATE BREATHE.

30:42.065 --> 30:46.467
COME ON. BREATHE.

30:46.467 --> 30:48.868
COME ON, BREATHE.

30:49.268 --> 30:50.468
HE'S GONE.

30:50.468 --> 30:53.270
COME ON, BREATHE!

30:56.071 --> 31:00.874
ADAM...

31:07.677 --> 31:09.277
DID YOU
GET HIS BLOOD WORK DONE?

31:09.678 --> 31:11.679
YEAH.

31:11.679 --> 31:15.681
I ISOLATED
THE VIRUS, BUT KILLING
IT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.895
HEY, HEY, HEY.

31:46.895 --> 31:48.495
SHAL, HE SAID TO WAIT FOR HIM.

31:48.495 --> 31:50.897
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU SO INTERESTED
IN FOLLOWING THE RULES?

31:54.098 --> 31:56.099
ADAM. WE GOT TROUBLE.

31:56.099 --> 31:57.300
SHAL'S GONE.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.100
I'M GOING AFTER HER.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.301
ALL RIGHT.

31:59.301 --> 32:00.501
GET ON IT.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.102
IF SHE STARTS TO LOSE CONTROL,
WE NEED TO HAVE HER SOME

32:02.102 --> 32:05.704
PLACE SAFE UNTIL
I CAN WORK OUT A CURE.

32:06.905 --> 32:08.105
JESSE, FIRE UP THE HELIX.

32:08.105 --> 32:08.905
EMMA, LET'S GO.

32:09.305 --> 32:11.306
WE'RE ON THE MOVE!

33:06.932 --> 33:10.533
HE'S HERE.

33:11.735 --> 33:13.736
GET DOWN!

33:15.737 --> 33:16.937
GET OUT OF HERE.

33:16.937 --> 33:17.738
GET OUT OF HERE.

33:18.137 --> 33:20.138
I'LL GET THE BASTARD.

33:35.746 --> 33:40.547
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

33:40.547 --> 33:41.749
COME ON. COME ON.

33:41.749 --> 33:42.548
AGH!

33:42.949 --> 33:44.150
LET'S GO!

34:29.771 --> 34:30.971
COME ON.

34:30.971 --> 34:31.772
SHAL, COME ON.

34:32.172 --> 34:33.371
COME ON, WE
GOTTA GET GRADY'S GUN.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.572
COME ON.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.572
COME ON, SHAL, COME ON.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.011
BRENNAN, SHALIMAR?

34:46.411 --> 34:47.612
I STILL CAN'T REACH 'EM.

34:48.012 --> 34:50.013
AH, IT COULD BE
SATELLITE INTERFERENCE.

34:50.013 --> 34:53.215
SHOULD CLEAR
UP AS WE GET CLOSER.

34:56.817 --> 34:57.617
YOU CAN MAKE IT, SHAL.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.217
YOU CAN MAKE IT.

34:59.217 --> 35:00.818
WAIT.

35:01.218 --> 35:02.420
WHAT?

35:02.420 --> 35:05.621
MY VISION'S CHANGING.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.422
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:08.822 --> 35:11.624
IT MUST BE THE VIRUS.

35:11.624 --> 35:12.824
WE GOTTA GET YOU TO BASE CAMP.

35:13.224 --> 35:14.825
NO, WAIT.

35:14.825 --> 35:16.025
WE'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

35:16.426 --> 35:17.626
WE HAVE TO GO AND HELP HIM.

35:17.626 --> 35:19.627
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:20.027 --> 35:21.228
YOU'RE
NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.

35:21.628 --> 35:22.829
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO FOR HIM NOW.

35:23.228 --> 35:24.430
YOU'RE WRONG.

35:24.430 --> 35:25.630
WE NEED TO KEEP GOING.

35:25.630 --> 35:27.631
I SAID YOU'RE
GOING THE WRONG WAY.

35:27.631 --> 35:29.231
SHALIMAR?

35:42.438 --> 35:43.639
HOW'S IT GOING?

35:43.639 --> 35:45.639
WELL, I'M FLYING BLIND HERE.

35:45.639 --> 35:47.640
I'M HOPING THIS
ANTI-VIRUS WORKS,

35:47.640 --> 35:49.241
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KNOW
FOR SURE UNLESS IT'S TESTED.

35:49.641 --> 35:52.843
AND SHALIMAR'S THE GUINEA PIG.

35:52.843 --> 35:55.644
YEAH.

35:56.844 --> 35:58.845
LOOK, WE'RE ALL
WORRIED ABOUT HER, ADAM,

35:58.845 --> 36:01.647
BUT IT'S GOING
TO WORK. I KNOW IT IS.

36:01.647 --> 36:03.247
THANKS.

36:10.451 --> 36:12.452
SHALIMAR!

36:14.052 --> 36:15.653
SHALIMAR!

37:27.687 --> 37:30.488
UGH!

37:30.888 --> 37:32.489
MICHAEL.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.495
IS THIS YOU?

37:48.096 --> 37:50.897
IS THIS YOUR FAMILY?

37:52.898 --> 37:55.299
IS THIS YOU?

37:57.701 --> 38:00.101
UH...

38:04.103 --> 38:05.704
UGH!

38:17.309 --> 38:18.511
BRENNAN.

38:18.511 --> 38:19.711
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

38:19.711 --> 38:20.911
YEAH, I'M HERE.

38:20.911 --> 38:22.512
I'VE LOST SHALIMAR.

38:22.512 --> 38:23.713
SHE'S NOT RATIONAL
ANY MORE, ADAM.

38:24.113 --> 38:25.313
I THINK WE'RE LOSING HER.

38:25.313 --> 38:26.514
WELL, WE STILL GOT TIME.

38:26.514 --> 38:27.715
HAVE TO GET TO HER FAST.

38:27.715 --> 38:29.315
IS SHE CLOSE?

38:29.315 --> 38:30.916
YEAH, I THINK
I GOT A FIX ON HER.

38:30.916 --> 38:34.518
YOU HAVE TO TRACK
ME ON MY COMLINK.

38:38.119 --> 38:40.120
SHALIMAR.

38:45.322 --> 38:47.724
BRENNAN?

38:48.525 --> 38:50.925
SHAL.

39:04.131 --> 39:05.732
NO!

39:05.732 --> 39:07.733
AGH!

39:09.333 --> 39:11.334
MICHAEL, STOP!

39:11.334 --> 39:13.335
AGH!

39:13.335 --> 39:15.336
AGH...

39:15.336 --> 39:16.538
AGH...

39:16.538 --> 39:18.138
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

39:18.538 --> 39:20.539
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO YOU.

39:23.741 --> 39:27.342
WE WANT TO HELP.

39:28.943 --> 39:30.944
KILL ME.

39:30.944 --> 39:34.946
I CAN'T.

39:34.946 --> 39:38.548
AGGHHH... AGH... AGH...

40:14.164 --> 40:17.365
I'M SORRY.

40:17.365 --> 40:20.967
THANK YOU.

40:25.369 --> 40:26.570
BRENNAN.

40:26.570 --> 40:27.770
BRENNAN?

40:27.770 --> 40:29.371
YOU OKAY?

40:29.771 --> 40:30.171
OHHH...

40:30.171 --> 40:32.172
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:52.982 --> 40:57.384
THEY TURNED HIM INTO A MONSTER.

40:57.784 --> 41:02.186
HE WAS ONE OF US.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.202
WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO TELL US?

41:36.202 --> 41:37.803
WELL, HER FEVER'S DOWN.

41:38.203 --> 41:41.004
SHE'S RESPONDING
TO THE ANTI-VIRUS.

41:41.004 --> 41:43.806
WELL, WHY AREN'T
I FEELING RELIEVED.

41:44.206 --> 41:47.007
THERE'S MORE TO
IT THAN THAT, ISN'T THERE?

41:47.007 --> 41:49.809
I MEAN, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO SAVE HER THIS TIME, BUT...

41:49.809 --> 41:52.610
I MEAN, WE'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT OUR MUTATIONS LEAVE US OPEN

41:52.610 --> 41:54.210
TO, WILL WE?

41:54.210 --> 41:56.211
THERE'S NO GUARANTEES
IN LIFE, EMMA.

41:56.211 --> 41:58.613
NOT FOR NEW MUTANTS.

41:59.013 --> 42:00.614
NOT FOR ANYBODY.
