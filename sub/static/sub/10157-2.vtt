WEBVTT

00:13.027 --> 00:15.029
So that'll be $2.35.

00:16.906 --> 00:20.284
Shit.
Fuck, dude, I don't have my wallet.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.619
Can I pay you back later?

00:21.702 --> 00:23.329
No, we don't do that.

00:23.412 --> 00:24.998
Dude, I live, like,
two blocks from here.

00:25.081 --> 00:26.624
I'll run home, get money,
come back, pay you.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.168
I'll pay you more than I owe you.
I'll give you a big tip.

00:29.252 --> 00:31.713
No. You just go home,
get your money,

00:31.796 --> 00:33.547
then come back
and get your coffee.

00:33.631 --> 00:36.592
Dude, I fucking need this coffee
right now, please, dude.

00:36.675 --> 00:39.303
I need it to, like, you know,
get shit going.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.389
Please, please, do me a solid.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.891
This isn't a charity.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.684
If you not gonna pay it, just go.
Get out.

00:45.769 --> 00:48.062
What, you're just gonna
let that coffee get cold?

00:48.146 --> 00:49.856
You're just gonna waste
that cup of coffee?

00:49.939 --> 00:51.775
- Yeah.
- That doesn't make any sense.

00:51.858 --> 00:54.568
No, I'm fucking taking this coffee
right now.

00:54.652 --> 00:56.279
No, no, no, no,
you stealing the coffee.

00:56.362 --> 00:58.948
I'm calling the police.
You're on the cameras.

00:59.032 --> 01:00.699
-I'm on the cameras? Big fucking deal.
-Yeah, yeah. It's--

01:00.784 --> 01:03.536
Hi, hello. Fuck you. Fuck you.
I don't care, you have me on the camera.

01:03.619 --> 01:05.038
You know me, dude.
I'm good for it.

01:05.121 --> 01:06.455
I'll come right back.

01:06.539 --> 01:09.583
Hey, you know what?
I got this. It's cool.

01:10.084 --> 01:11.502
Are you sure?

01:11.585 --> 01:14.088
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:14.172 --> 01:15.840
Okay.

01:15.924 --> 01:17.341
And a pack of cigarettes?

01:18.551 --> 01:20.094
And a pack of smokes.

01:20.178 --> 01:21.179
Parliaments.

01:28.019 --> 01:29.187
Thanks.

01:30.939 --> 01:33.024
You know what?
Fuck you.

01:33.107 --> 01:36.152
You're a mean,
nasty little motherfucker.

01:36.235 --> 01:39.072
You know me.
I come in here every fucking week.

01:39.155 --> 01:41.282
I know your whole fucking family.

01:41.365 --> 01:43.451
I know your mother.
She's mean.

01:43.534 --> 01:45.954
I know your brother.
He looks weirdly old.

01:46.037 --> 01:48.414
And your creepy uncle
that says dumb shit to me,

01:48.497 --> 01:49.999
but I don't ever complain about that.

01:50.083 --> 01:54.295
You're just a lonely, sad,
evil motherfucker!

01:57.548 --> 01:59.550
Okay. So...

01:59.633 --> 02:01.177
that'll be $9.89.

02:26.285 --> 02:27.578
Hey.

02:28.371 --> 02:29.372
Hey.

02:29.455 --> 02:32.416
I'm not crazy.
That dude's a fucking asshole.

02:33.751 --> 02:36.254
Yeah. No...
I don't know.

02:37.421 --> 02:39.507
What? I have money.
I can pay you back.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.218
Uh, yeah, I know. It's...
But you don't have to.

02:42.301 --> 02:43.887
I live, like, two blocks from here.

02:43.970 --> 02:47.974
If you just follow me,
I'll run inside and grab you your money.

02:48.057 --> 02:49.934
Uh...

02:50.018 --> 02:51.519
You know what?
It's totally cool.

02:51.602 --> 02:53.897
It's on me.
Just, um, you can have a nice day.

02:53.980 --> 02:55.940
Don't be a fucking hero.

03:00.653 --> 03:02.405
So you live nearby?
It's not, like...

03:03.447 --> 03:05.992
-a huge haul?
-I live right nearby.

03:06.951 --> 03:08.327
I'm Mickey.

03:08.411 --> 03:11.372
Mickey, hey, I'm Gus.
Nice to meet ya.

03:15.501 --> 03:17.628
So you live around here?

03:17.711 --> 03:20.173
- Yeah, right up there.
- Cool.

03:21.174 --> 03:22.716
For how long?

03:22.800 --> 03:26.095
I moved here, I wanna say,
five, six years ago, from Jersey.

03:26.179 --> 03:28.431
-Ah.
-Where are you from?

03:28.514 --> 03:29.640
Oh, I'm sure you've heard of it.

03:29.723 --> 03:33.311
It's the, uh... major city
of Brookings, South Dakota.

03:33.394 --> 03:36.147
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy who invented boredom's from there.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.856
Yeah, right, yeah.

03:37.941 --> 03:40.109
It's for, uh, all the people
who can't handle

03:40.193 --> 03:43.404
all the intensity of, uh...
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you know?

03:47.158 --> 03:48.409
Where do you live in LA?

03:49.535 --> 03:53.497
-Um... you know the Hollywood sign?
-Mmm-hmm.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.250
I actually live inside the letter "O."

03:58.002 --> 03:59.420
Which one? There are three.

04:00.671 --> 04:02.506
Good question.
It's a great question.

04:02.590 --> 04:06.052
Uh, well, not the first "O,"
'cause the rent's insane.

04:06.135 --> 04:07.136
Obviously.

04:07.220 --> 04:09.805
Uh... but I live in the second "O."

04:10.806 --> 04:13.017
In "wood."
First "O" in "wood."

04:31.160 --> 04:33.662
Yeah!
Go faster, go faster!

04:33.746 --> 04:34.830
Jacob, settle.

04:34.913 --> 04:36.790
-Someone needs a nap.
-Faster!

04:40.753 --> 04:42.296
I don't normally like to gossip,

04:42.380 --> 04:45.549
but did you hear
that Jacob needs a nap?

04:45.633 --> 04:47.510
I did. I did hear that.

04:47.593 --> 04:51.889
And it's like,
"Fuckin' Jacob, give your mom a break."

04:54.225 --> 04:55.268
So, yeah, I'm not for sure,

04:55.351 --> 04:59.480
but I think around here's where
they filmed, uh, Armed and Dangerous.

04:59.563 --> 05:02.025
John Candy and Eugene Levy and...

05:02.108 --> 05:05.236
They play these, like,
security guards who, um...

05:06.362 --> 05:09.782
They, like, bust, like, a coke ring,
drug cartel sort of thing.

05:09.865 --> 05:11.784
- You're making this up.
- No, no.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.494
It is very real

05:13.577 --> 05:15.954
and... very funny.

05:16.039 --> 05:19.875
My friends once Airbnb'd the house
from Nightmare on Elm Street.

05:19.958 --> 05:22.795
-Whoa! So cool. That's awesome.
-Fuck, no.

05:22.878 --> 05:25.756
I wouldn't wanna sleep in the house
where Freddy Krueger lived.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.467
Well, Freddy didn't live there.

05:28.551 --> 05:31.679
It's, like, the girl who has nightmares
about Freddy lives there.

05:31.762 --> 05:33.056
Whatever, it...

05:40.646 --> 05:42.273
- You got work today?
- Nah.

05:42.356 --> 05:44.608
- You?
- Monday.

05:44.692 --> 05:45.776
What do you do?

05:45.859 --> 05:49.238
I'm a program manager
at a satellite radio station.

05:49.322 --> 05:51.949
Ah, that sounds important.

05:52.032 --> 05:54.952
Sounds way more important than it is.
You?

05:55.035 --> 05:57.663
-I work in TV.
-Oh!

05:57.746 --> 06:00.333
Yeah. I'm an on-set teacher.

06:00.416 --> 06:02.960
Oh, you're a... you're a tutor?

06:03.043 --> 06:05.213
Yeah. On-set teacher.

06:05.296 --> 06:07.548
- For the show, um...
- Witchita.

06:09.007 --> 06:10.843
-Have you heard of it?
-No.

06:10.926 --> 06:11.927
Oh, it's this, uh...

06:12.010 --> 06:16.557
It's a show about this group of witches
who secretly live in the suburbs.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.226
Sort of like, um...

06:18.309 --> 06:22.020
Desperate Housewives meets...
I don't know, witches.

06:22.105 --> 06:23.564
Oh, wait, I've seen the billboard
for that show.

06:23.647 --> 06:26.817
The "T" in Witchita is a witch
being burned on a cross?

06:26.900 --> 06:28.986
- That's right. That's the one.

06:29.069 --> 06:32.115
So, is that what you wanna do,
just be a tutor forever?

06:32.198 --> 06:35.659
No. I mean, I'd like to be more
on the creative side of things.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.035
I actually...

06:37.120 --> 06:40.706
I wrote this episode of Witchita
and it's just, like, in my drawer and,

06:40.789 --> 06:42.500
you know, I'm hoping one day,

06:42.583 --> 06:45.085
maybe I can give it
to the right person on the show and...

06:45.169 --> 06:46.379
I don't know.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.339
You wanna write for Witchita?

06:48.422 --> 06:50.174
Well, I'm not--

06:50.258 --> 06:54.094
I mean, it's more of a means to an end,
like, I guess my goal is, um...

06:54.178 --> 06:55.304
This is weird.

06:55.388 --> 06:58.391
Have you ever heard of,
um, erotic thrillers?

06:58.474 --> 07:00.017
Like, horror porn?

07:01.018 --> 07:02.353
No, more like, uh...

07:02.436 --> 07:05.981
Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct
or, like, Brian De Palma movies.

07:06.064 --> 07:08.025
You know, people love those movies.

07:08.108 --> 07:10.111
And they made a whole bunch of 'em
but now they don't anymore.

07:10.194 --> 07:12.155
So I feel like, you know,
people would really...

07:12.238 --> 07:13.531
Yeah, I guess now with the Internet,

07:13.614 --> 07:15.866
you don't have to go
to a movie theater to see boobs.

07:16.742 --> 07:18.244
I think that's part of it, yeah.

07:18.327 --> 07:19.453
Plus, you know,

07:19.537 --> 07:22.456
Michael Douglas is, like,
200 years old now, so...

07:22.540 --> 07:25.126
Well, if you ever make one of those,
I will go see it in the theater.

07:25.209 --> 07:26.294
Those movies are great.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.003
This is my place, so...

07:28.086 --> 07:30.173
-I'll run in and grab my wallet.
-Okay.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.347
Hey, morning.

07:38.431 --> 07:39.848
- What?

07:39.932 --> 07:41.058
Morning.

07:44.312 --> 07:45.729
-Hi!
-Hi.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.441
Uh, you weren't here when I got here,
so I just let myself in.

07:48.524 --> 07:50.568
Also, the door was unlocked,
so I just walked in.

07:50.651 --> 07:52.736
I gotta grab something from my room.

07:52.820 --> 07:53.987
Great.

07:56.615 --> 07:57.908
What?

08:01.745 --> 08:02.871
Shit.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.252
Fuck! Shit!

08:08.836 --> 08:11.672
Hey, uh, I can't find my wallet.
Can I borrow 20 bucks?

08:11.755 --> 08:13.382
Oh, sorry.
I'm paper-free.

08:13.466 --> 08:15.343
I only use credit cards and Apple Pay.

08:15.426 --> 08:16.594
Oh.

08:17.928 --> 08:20.055
-How's the unpacking going?
-Good. Good.

08:20.138 --> 08:21.932
Could you help me
carry my dresser in?

08:23.726 --> 08:24.935
Of course.

08:25.018 --> 08:26.437
So I'll just, uh...

08:26.520 --> 08:28.272
- Just back it up here. Ooh.

08:28.356 --> 08:29.607
-This is heavy.
-Yeah.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.235
- You mind if we just set it down?

08:32.318 --> 08:35.196
I think if we take the drawers out,
it'd just be, uh, a lot lighter.

08:35.279 --> 08:36.489
Oh, okay.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.532
-Oh. You got stuff in here.
-Yeah.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.370
--Ow!

08:42.453 --> 08:44.288
-What are those, books?
-Yeah.

08:44.372 --> 08:46.332
-Coloring books.
-From when I was a kid.

08:47.666 --> 08:49.293
You took all this stuff
with you from Australia?

08:49.377 --> 08:51.212
Yeah, it all reminds me of home.

08:51.295 --> 08:53.839
-Oh, that's nice.
-Yeah.

08:54.465 --> 08:56.509
Oh, yeah, that's much better.
That's good.

08:56.592 --> 08:58.261
So, how long have you known Mickey for?

08:58.344 --> 09:01.096
Uh, about 15 minutes.
How about you?

09:01.179 --> 09:02.473
Since yesterday.

09:04.057 --> 09:06.519
-She's cool, right?
-Oh, my God, she's so cool.

09:06.602 --> 09:08.979
-Yeah.
-Yeah. But, like, a little bit scary.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.899
-Yeah, she is scary, right?
-But so cool.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.401
Oh. Fart.

09:13.484 --> 09:14.902
Okay. Sorry.

09:14.985 --> 09:17.655
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

09:17.738 --> 09:19.072
So where are we, uh, taking this?

09:19.156 --> 09:21.116
-To the back bedroom.
-Oh, okay.

09:21.199 --> 09:22.326
Oh, you guys made it in.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.328
Yeah.

09:24.412 --> 09:26.289
Sorry, I had to pee so bad.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.832
-Oh, we managed. Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.794
So, I left my wallet at this place,
Bliss House.

09:32.711 --> 09:35.506
I went there last night and I think
I dropped it in the collection basket.

09:35.589 --> 09:39.176
Oh, wow. That sounds,
like, super stressful.

09:39.260 --> 09:40.969
Well, you don't have to worry
about paying me back.

09:41.053 --> 09:42.555
You know, I'm just gonna head home.

09:42.638 --> 09:45.140
I'll Uber home or something. Yeah.

09:45.223 --> 09:47.935
I can give you a ride.
I have to go to Bliss House anyway.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.562
I can go there first, get my wallet.

09:49.645 --> 09:52.230
That sounds like it will work perfectly.

09:52.315 --> 09:55.025
Oh, uh, yeah.
I mean, if you don't...

09:55.943 --> 09:57.403
mind, er...

09:57.486 --> 09:59.905
-It was her idea. Why would she mind?
-Right.

09:59.988 --> 10:01.699
Come on.
What the fuck else are you gonna do today?

10:01.782 --> 10:03.241
Let's go have an adventure.

10:03.326 --> 10:04.993
Yeah. Sure.

10:05.077 --> 10:06.954
Have an adventure. Okay.

10:26.264 --> 10:28.392
-This is the place?
-Oh, yeah, this is it.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.061
I went to visit my friend here last night,

10:31.144 --> 10:33.647
and it turned out to be
some kind of, like, church?

10:33.731 --> 10:35.148
- Mmm-hmm.
- Which isn't really my thing.

10:35.232 --> 10:37.901
But then they passed around a basket
and I didn't wanna be rude,

10:37.985 --> 10:39.152
so I put a couple dollars in,

10:39.236 --> 10:40.696
and then I guess
I put my whole wallet in.

10:40.779 --> 10:42.906
You dropped the whole wallet in?

10:42.990 --> 10:46.118
Yeah.
Ambien and going out don't mix.

10:46.201 --> 10:48.036
Oh, I'll remember that.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.331
So...
Wait, so the guy you met here,

10:50.414 --> 10:53.501
was he, like, a boyfriend guy, or what?

10:53.584 --> 10:57.004
Maybe if that door's locked,
you can boost me up through that window.

10:57.087 --> 10:58.339
Uh...

10:58.422 --> 11:00.298
-Okay.
-Oh!

11:00.383 --> 11:01.675
Oh.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.519
Is anyone here?

11:12.561 --> 11:15.105
-Are we scared?
-I think this is the way.

11:15.981 --> 11:17.775
- Oh, my God! Holy fuck!

11:19.109 --> 11:21.153
Cut, cut!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

11:21.236 --> 11:22.279
What the fuck is this?

11:22.362 --> 11:23.447
- Oh, my God.

11:23.531 --> 11:24.615
What the fuck is this?

11:24.698 --> 11:26.659
Sorry,
I thought this was Bliss House.

11:26.742 --> 11:28.452
What's Blizzows?

11:28.536 --> 11:30.370
I was here last night,
and this was a church.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.081
Yeah, it's a rental location.
Who's posted at the back door?

11:33.165 --> 11:35.125
We just lost an entire fucking take!

11:35.208 --> 11:37.753
And you, Sparky? Yeah.
I can see you breathing on the monitor.

11:37.836 --> 11:40.130
You breathe again
and I'll fucking kill you for real.

11:40.213 --> 11:41.214
All right, let's go again.

11:41.298 --> 11:42.633
Uh, is there a lost and found?

11:42.716 --> 11:44.176
Oh, my God!
Are you still here?

11:44.259 --> 11:46.011
Can you go, please?
Can you, please?

11:46.094 --> 11:48.180
-I beg of you. Just go.
-All right, folks, I need you to clear.

11:48.263 --> 11:49.973
-When is this gonna be on?
-What the fuck are we making?

11:50.057 --> 11:52.810
Huh, guys? A student film?
Is that what this is?

11:52.893 --> 11:54.645
Am I the only one here who gives a shit?

11:55.312 --> 11:56.605
Congrats on finding your wallet.

11:56.689 --> 11:58.356
I can't believe it.
They didn't steal anything.

11:58.441 --> 12:01.318
-I know.
-I mean, big ups for Bliss House.

12:01.401 --> 12:05.030
Who puts a wallet with money in it
into a lost and found?

12:05.113 --> 12:07.658
-I would.
-Yeah, right.

12:07.741 --> 12:09.785
I'm serious. Why would I steal
somebody's, like, wallet?

12:09.868 --> 12:11.161
That's insane.

12:11.244 --> 12:13.997
Aw, what a nice
little Midwesterner you are.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.123
Oh.

12:15.207 --> 12:17.250
My mom always tells me
I should date a Midwestern boy,

12:17.334 --> 12:19.503
'cause they're really
sweet and honest.

12:19.587 --> 12:20.629
-Oh, really?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:20.713 --> 12:22.130
Well, uh, tell your mom...

12:22.214 --> 12:23.799
to go fuck herself.

12:25.425 --> 12:27.427
I'm kidding, that's a joke.
I didn't...

12:27.511 --> 12:28.554
I got it.

12:28.637 --> 12:30.263
You know what's good for a hangover?

12:30.347 --> 12:31.682
-Hmm?
-Rally's breakfast food.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.934
And I'm finally awake
early enough to eat it.

12:34.017 --> 12:35.060
Yeah. Yeah.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.150
Oh, you know what else
would make you feel good?

12:42.234 --> 12:43.443
-What, like, fluids?
-Weed.

12:43.527 --> 12:44.695
Oh, weed.

12:44.778 --> 12:46.822
Really? Oh.

12:46.905 --> 12:48.115
Okay, I guess I wouldn't think...

12:48.198 --> 12:50.200
you know, that would be the best...
Sure.

12:50.283 --> 12:52.870
Yeah, no, 'cause if you smoke,
then you're gonna feel better.

12:52.953 --> 12:56.624
And then if you're stoned,
the food is gonna taste even better.

12:56.707 --> 12:58.458
Which I didn't even think was possible.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.961
Um... yeah. Okay.

13:01.044 --> 13:03.672
No, let's do it.
Let's, uh... let's get high.

13:03.756 --> 13:04.965
Do you not really smoke?

13:05.674 --> 13:08.636
I'm not, like, fucking...
Cheech and Chong or something.

13:08.719 --> 13:09.970
But, no, I...

13:10.053 --> 13:11.722
Yeah, well,
I don't normally, like...

13:11.805 --> 13:14.850
do this, like, wake and bake or whatever.
I'm not a stoner. It just...

13:14.933 --> 13:16.226
You seem like
you could use it right now.

13:16.309 --> 13:17.352
Yeah, and I'm not judging you.

13:17.435 --> 13:19.021
It's like, no judgments
or anything, you know?

13:19.104 --> 13:20.313
Here.

13:20.397 --> 13:22.190
Oh, okay. Um...

13:24.359 --> 13:25.861
So, I, uh...

13:41.752 --> 13:43.461
Oh, Jesus fuckin'...

13:44.421 --> 13:46.674
-Okay.
-How old are you?

13:46.757 --> 13:48.884
-Why?
-I don't know.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.385
Wait.

13:50.468 --> 13:52.638
Do I seem like I'm 12 years old
right now or...

13:52.721 --> 13:54.807
You're like a 40-year-old
12-year-old or something.

13:54.890 --> 13:57.392
I'm, uh...
I'm 31.

13:57.475 --> 13:58.936
-Okay.
-How old are you?

13:59.019 --> 14:00.062
I'm 32.

14:00.145 --> 14:01.980
Oh, so you're, like,
a grade older than me.

14:02.064 --> 14:03.649
Mmm-hmm.
I'm the older woman.

14:03.732 --> 14:05.651
So in a year, you'll be...

14:06.735 --> 14:08.571
as old as, um...

14:08.654 --> 14:10.363
Jesus when he died.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.416
Wow.

14:21.499 --> 14:23.126
Whoa, it's coming out your...

14:23.210 --> 14:24.670
You're really good at that.

14:24.753 --> 14:27.840
It's like watching my dad change a tire.

14:27.923 --> 14:29.257
Here, take another.

14:29.341 --> 14:30.801
Okay. Yeah.

14:40.185 --> 14:41.729
I'm sorry
I'm coughing so much. I--

14:41.812 --> 14:43.105
It's okay. How you feelin'?

14:43.188 --> 14:44.522
Good.

14:45.608 --> 14:46.734
This is strong stuff.

14:46.817 --> 14:49.069
Yeah. Green Crack.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.780
It's like a hyper
sort of super mellow high.

14:51.864 --> 14:52.948
Heavy indica.

14:53.031 --> 14:54.700
-Indica?
-Yeah.

14:54.783 --> 14:55.909
What's indica, again?

14:55.993 --> 14:59.079
Indica like "in the couch."
Body high.

14:59.162 --> 15:00.789
Oh, in da couch.

15:00.873 --> 15:03.083
- In da car seat.

15:08.881 --> 15:10.340
I'm just getting a little hot,
so I'm just gonna--

15:10.423 --> 15:12.384
What the fuck are you doing?
No, we're hot-boxing.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.844
No, no, no, don't dilute it
with oxygen.

15:13.927 --> 15:15.888
Oh. Okay.

15:15.971 --> 15:17.264
Okay.

15:17.347 --> 15:18.891
-You're gonna be fine.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:23.687 --> 15:24.938
What's that sign say?

15:26.356 --> 15:28.400
"One way."

15:28.483 --> 15:29.902
"One way."

15:31.486 --> 15:32.988
"One way."

15:34.698 --> 15:36.366
Is that the secret to life?

15:37.951 --> 15:39.577
Maybe.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.038
Who's to say?

15:44.082 --> 15:47.502
You're a weird little dude.

15:47.585 --> 15:49.254
-Stoned or not.
-Yeah.

15:49.337 --> 15:51.256
- You're a fucking weird little dude.

16:02.059 --> 16:03.811
So you don't need these windows up?

16:05.062 --> 16:07.314
No. I'm smoking a cigarette.

16:08.732 --> 16:11.068
Oh, 'cause it stinks,
you have the windows down.

16:12.027 --> 16:14.279
But you're not concerned anymore
about the hot-boxing.

16:14.362 --> 16:15.488
-With the smoke--
-Dude, you're high.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.324
Don't worry about the hot-boxing.

16:29.753 --> 16:31.463
Welcome to Rally's.
Can I take your order?

16:31.546 --> 16:32.840
Yeah, can I get
two hash browns?

16:32.923 --> 16:34.257
Yes!

16:34.341 --> 16:36.551
-Probably get four.
-Yes!

16:36.634 --> 16:39.429
And then can you take some
hamburger cheese and melt it on top?

16:39.512 --> 16:41.807
Oh, fuck, yes.

16:41.890 --> 16:43.516
--We can't do that, ma'am.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.143
Yeah, you can.
I've done it before.

16:45.227 --> 16:46.603
Is Jeff there?
'Cause he knows the drill.

16:47.980 --> 16:50.523
Then, oh, uh,
two breakfast sandwiches.

16:50.607 --> 16:52.025
And then add two more to that.

16:52.109 --> 16:55.112
And then, for two of those,
take the bacon away,

16:55.195 --> 16:57.155
put some sausage on it.

16:57.239 --> 17:01.576
And for the other two, take...
the cheese off of one,

17:01.659 --> 17:03.829
then add more cheese to the second one.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.210
Why is that guy staring at us?

17:10.293 --> 17:12.254
-What? What guy?
-You see that?

17:12.337 --> 17:14.506
You see that guy, like,
across the street, like, in the window?

17:14.589 --> 17:16.633
He's, like, this Asian guy
and he's, like, looking at us.

17:16.717 --> 17:18.719
Like, through the fucking window.
What's his problem?

17:18.802 --> 17:21.471
Who's that guy?
Why is he staring at us?

17:22.555 --> 17:25.934
That's a cardboard cut-out of
an Asian lady giving somebody a massage.

17:27.728 --> 17:29.813
Right. No, but she's, like,
staring at us though, right?

17:29.897 --> 17:31.148
Yeah, it's aggressive.

17:31.231 --> 17:32.858
Yeah. It's unnerving.

17:32.941 --> 17:34.026
Anything else?

17:34.109 --> 17:36.862
Yeah, we should probably get two coffees.

17:36.945 --> 17:39.072
-Fuck, yes.
-Fuck you.

17:40.198 --> 17:42.242
I love this so much.

17:42.325 --> 17:44.494
I feel like it hasn't tasted
this good since I was a kid.

17:44.577 --> 17:46.704
Mmm!
I love the way it smells.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.456
Yeah! I know.

17:48.540 --> 17:52.002
My last girlfriend,
she fuckin' hated the smell of fast food.

17:52.085 --> 17:54.129
She hated it when I ate,
like, fast food.

17:54.212 --> 17:55.713
Is that why you guys broke up?

17:55.798 --> 17:57.507
'Cause of your affair
with fast food?

17:57.590 --> 17:59.634
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- She, uh...

17:59.717 --> 18:01.386
caught me fooling around
with a Big Mac once.

18:01.469 --> 18:05.598
Yeah, she, like, walked in on us,
and I was, like, playing with its boobs.

18:09.812 --> 18:11.313
I regret making that joke.

18:13.816 --> 18:17.069
-So, you guys broke up, huh?
-Yeah.

18:17.152 --> 18:21.573
I know it's supposed to be, like...
the nice thing to say, like,

18:21.656 --> 18:24.742
"Oh, we broke up
and it was mutual," but...

18:26.161 --> 18:27.913
Whatever.
Like, I broke up with her.

18:27.996 --> 18:29.247
Why?

18:29.331 --> 18:30.540
She cheated on me.

18:30.623 --> 18:33.001
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
That fucking sucks.

18:33.794 --> 18:35.420
Yeah, I'm getting through it.

18:35.503 --> 18:38.966
And we'd been together for a few years.
It's just weird 'cause, like,

18:39.049 --> 18:41.676
I was with somebody else
a few years before that,

18:41.759 --> 18:44.012
and so it's just like,
I feel like I'm, like...

18:44.096 --> 18:47.474
leap-frogging, you know, from, like,
one long-term thing to the next.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.852
And it's just like...

18:49.935 --> 18:51.603
I feel you on that one.

18:51.686 --> 18:53.856
I went to Bliss House last night
to see my ex.

18:55.357 --> 18:57.484
I think he's still really hung up on me.

18:58.276 --> 19:01.238
And it's sad, you know?
Sad to see him sad.

19:01.321 --> 19:03.490
But I didn't fuckin' cave.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.033
Oh, that's good.

19:05.117 --> 19:06.201
-Cheers to me.
-Good for you.

19:06.284 --> 19:07.702
-Cheers to you.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:07.785 --> 19:09.287
Definitely.

19:09.371 --> 19:10.580
How are you doing?
Are you hungover?

19:11.331 --> 19:13.416
Uh... I'm feeling better.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.003
Like, all over.
I'm just feeling, like...

19:16.086 --> 19:17.963
up here, a little spacey.

19:18.046 --> 19:19.381
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh--

19:19.464 --> 19:20.673
I thought the coffee would fix that.

19:20.757 --> 19:22.800
You know, caffeine and weed.
Poor man's speedball.

19:23.969 --> 19:25.012
What'd you say?

19:25.929 --> 19:28.098
Oh, speedball?

19:28.181 --> 19:30.392
I thought you said,
"Poor man's Spaceballs."

19:30.475 --> 19:32.936
So I was like, fuckin'...

19:34.354 --> 19:37.774
a guy, like, with no money,
like, made Spaceballs?

19:39.317 --> 19:40.360
Is that even conceivable?

19:40.443 --> 19:43.071
That a guy who had no money
would make Spaceballs?

19:43.155 --> 19:44.197
Let's get you home.

19:44.281 --> 19:45.532
Oh, okay.

19:49.369 --> 19:50.662
I think I need to lie down or something

19:50.745 --> 19:53.081
'cause I'm just, like...

19:53.165 --> 19:54.875
All right. Come on.
I'll put you in the backseat.

19:54.958 --> 19:57.585
Okay. Yeah.
No, you should see Spaceballs.

19:57.669 --> 19:59.337
It's, like, really funny.

19:59.421 --> 20:02.257
'Cause it's, like, a spoof of Star Wars,

20:02.340 --> 20:06.719
but it's also, like, a spoof of, like,
different sci-fi movies.

20:06.803 --> 20:09.722
Like, Planet of the Apes
and Star Trek. Like--

20:09.806 --> 20:11.599
Okay. Where do you live?

20:11.683 --> 20:13.643
Uh, 1410 Amber.

20:13.726 --> 20:15.520
Great. Taking you there.

20:17.397 --> 20:21.985
But it, like, really puts, like,
Star Wars in its crosshairs.

20:49.304 --> 20:51.723
-You got a busy day?
-Yeah.

20:51.806 --> 20:53.641
Doesn't seem like it,
'cause you got me high

20:53.725 --> 20:54.935
and then you drove around.

20:55.018 --> 20:57.687
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that, huh?

20:57.770 --> 21:00.065
No, I'm glad you did.
It's just, like...

21:00.148 --> 21:02.650
you didn't have stuff to do today.

21:02.817 --> 21:04.319
Gotta get cat food.

21:05.195 --> 21:06.989
- Hey, Mickey?
- Hmm?

21:07.072 --> 21:10.367
-Thanks for driving.
-You're welcome.

21:16.373 --> 21:17.832
All right, dude.
We're here.

21:24.297 --> 21:27.092
Shit! Fuck!
Back up. We gotta go.

21:27.175 --> 21:29.011
-You've gotta get out first.
-No, no, no.

21:29.094 --> 21:30.553
I fucked up
and gave the wrong address.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.805
This is Natalie's place, okay?
You gotta get of here. Fuck!

21:32.889 --> 21:34.266
-You took me to your ex-girlfriend's?
-Just go.

21:34.349 --> 21:35.475
-That's fuckin' awesome, dude.
-Just go.

21:35.558 --> 21:36.809
-Gus?
-Please, God damn it.

21:36.893 --> 21:40.397
-Shit, shit, shit!
-What're you doing here?

21:40.480 --> 21:42.440
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

21:42.524 --> 21:43.691
Why are you here?

21:43.775 --> 21:46.653
Uh... just...

21:46.736 --> 21:48.363
I'm just being a goof.

21:48.446 --> 21:49.822
I'm just being a goofball.

21:49.906 --> 21:51.699
I can't hear--
Can you roll down the window?

21:54.327 --> 21:56.288
-I said I'm being a goofball.
-Mmm.

21:57.998 --> 21:59.957
The car reeks of weed.

22:00.042 --> 22:01.751
-Does it?
-Yeah.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.921
Huh, I didn't...
I don't know why...

22:05.005 --> 22:07.424
Hi. Who's this?

22:09.801 --> 22:10.927
Hey, I'm Mickey.

22:11.011 --> 22:13.971
Oh, hi, Mickey.
Gus, what the fuck?

22:14.056 --> 22:16.183
I can explain. Okay?
Let me explain.

22:17.809 --> 22:20.395
-Okay, I know this is weird, okay?
-Sure.

22:20.478 --> 22:22.314
I fucked up.
I shouldn't have come here.

22:22.397 --> 22:26.234
It's 11:00 a.m. and you're stoned
and you're at my house. I'm worried.

22:26.318 --> 22:28.695
Well, you don't have to be worried
about me, okay?

22:28.778 --> 22:30.863
Like, I'm fine.
I'm having a good time.

22:30.947 --> 22:32.031
-Yeah. No, obviously.
-I'm having fun.

22:32.115 --> 22:34.617
And then you came here
to rub it in my face, or what?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.120
Huh? No, I just...

22:37.204 --> 22:39.956
I gave her, like, the wrong address
by accident, that's all.

22:40.039 --> 22:41.374
You meant to come here.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.586
You still think you live here?
You can't get over us being apart?

22:44.669 --> 22:45.920
Oh, my God, no.

22:46.003 --> 22:48.423
That is, like, so narcissistic of you.

22:48.506 --> 22:49.757
-So pathetic.
-It was a brain fart.

22:49.841 --> 22:51.468
I didn't mean to show up, okay?

22:51.551 --> 22:53.178
Great. Then maybe now
would be a good time

22:53.261 --> 22:54.846
to get the boxes out of my house.

22:54.929 --> 22:57.849
Natalie, there's not that many boxes,
okay? They're fine.

22:57.932 --> 23:00.268
Perfect.
Then I want my hallway cleared.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.854
Can I just come back later, because
this is, like, super awkward for me,

23:02.937 --> 23:04.356
and I don't want to have to be
going in and out--

23:04.439 --> 23:06.108
- Now!
- Okay.

23:07.775 --> 23:09.569
I got it.

23:09.652 --> 23:11.821
- Great. She's got it.
- She's gonna do it.

23:11.904 --> 23:12.947
Hmm? She's gonna do it.

23:13.030 --> 23:15.283
Hey, can you take your shoes off
before you walk into my house?

23:15.367 --> 23:16.409
Yeah.

23:17.410 --> 23:18.536
Shoes off!

23:26.169 --> 23:27.629
...work through it, you know?

23:30.632 --> 23:34.969
So you just came by here with her
to make me jealous, or what?

23:35.052 --> 23:36.596
I mean, I'm hooking up
with other people, too.

23:36.679 --> 23:37.722
-Great.
-Great!

23:37.805 --> 23:39.432
I'm glad you're hooking up
with people, okay?

23:39.516 --> 23:41.476
Because you did when we were together,

23:41.559 --> 23:43.853
so why would you stop
after we broke up, right?

23:43.936 --> 23:45.272
Well, if it makes you feel better,

23:45.355 --> 23:47.857
I wasn't hooking up with people
when we were together.

23:48.441 --> 23:49.484
What?

23:50.568 --> 23:51.611
I...

23:52.612 --> 23:54.322
I never cheated on you.

23:55.657 --> 23:57.325
Are you insane?

23:57.409 --> 23:59.994
You fucking... You told me.
You said you cheated on me.

24:00.077 --> 24:02.789
I needed to say that,
otherwise you'd never break up with me.

24:03.665 --> 24:06.168
So you lied about cheating on me?

24:06.251 --> 24:07.877
Just one more box.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.796
Why didn't you just break up with me?

24:09.879 --> 24:11.298
I fucking tried, asshole.

24:11.381 --> 24:12.799
-Mmm-hmm.
-I said that this isn't working,

24:12.882 --> 24:14.926
I said that I don't want to be
in this anymore,

24:15.009 --> 24:18.388
and then you would just hold me
and tell me that we would figure it out.

24:20.557 --> 24:21.683
...wanna see me get mad.

24:21.766 --> 24:23.560
I'm not gonna get mad, okay?

24:23.643 --> 24:25.144
You're just gonna pretend
it didn't happen,

24:25.228 --> 24:26.313
you're just gonna be okay with it.

24:26.396 --> 24:28.105
Yeah, which is, like, a responsible,

24:28.190 --> 24:30.192
you know, nice, kind thing to do--

24:30.275 --> 24:33.069
No, it's not! When one person
wants out and the other one

24:33.152 --> 24:34.654
-is forcing them to stay there...
-Uh-huh.

24:34.737 --> 24:37.407
...then your niceness
becomes an assault.

24:37.490 --> 24:40.243
-Your kindness is pure fucking hostility.
-Oh.

24:40.327 --> 24:42.078
All right. That's it.

24:42.161 --> 24:43.538
All right. You know what,
I'm gonna go, so...

24:43.621 --> 24:47.417
Yep, there's all your shit, Gus.
Just boxes of DVDs.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.543
They're not DVDs.

24:48.626 --> 24:50.086
-They're Blu-rays.
-Whatever.

24:50.169 --> 24:51.921
So when you call them DVDs,
you just actually end up

24:52.004 --> 24:53.172
sounding, like, super stupid.

24:53.256 --> 24:54.966
Okay, well, it's just shit
you can watch online.

24:55.049 --> 24:56.343
You can't watch it online, okay?

24:56.426 --> 24:59.762
These Blu-rays have, like,
exclusive, special features, you bitch!

24:59.846 --> 25:02.557
Great, it's just gonna be a bunch
of plastic that ends up in a landfill.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.517
You're right, you're right.
I'm a huge asshole

25:04.601 --> 25:06.269
because I like special features.

25:06.353 --> 25:07.895
No one cares about the special features.

25:07.979 --> 25:09.897
I do.
I care about special features.

25:09.981 --> 25:11.858
I think they rule
and I think they're awesome.

25:11.941 --> 25:14.068
You know what the problem
actually is with you?

25:14.151 --> 25:15.487
- Oh, tell me.
- That's it. We're done.

25:15.570 --> 25:17.280
Here you go. Mmm?

25:17.364 --> 25:20.032
Look, whatever you were
gonna say to him,

25:20.116 --> 25:21.826
he doesn't need to hear it right now.

25:24.036 --> 25:25.121
You know, Natalie,

25:25.204 --> 25:28.416
I can't believe you woke up
one morning and just said,

25:28.500 --> 25:30.668
"My life would be better without Gus,"

25:30.752 --> 25:32.629
but... lucky you.

25:33.546 --> 25:34.672
You got your wish.

25:42.514 --> 25:43.890
You know what, fuck her.

25:44.932 --> 25:46.393
It's like, she never loved me.

25:46.476 --> 25:49.562
Our whole relationship
was, like, fuckin' bullshit.

25:49.646 --> 25:51.273
Yeah, well, guess what?
Most are.

25:51.356 --> 25:52.857
You know what?
That's so true.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.191
And nobody ever tells you that.

25:54.276 --> 25:56.403
Nobody ever just pulls you aside
and goes,

25:56.486 --> 25:58.905
"Hey, just so you know,
relationships are fucking bullshit."

25:58.988 --> 26:02.492
So I just keep believing
in this fucking lie

26:02.575 --> 26:05.912
that a relationship evolves
and gets better and...

26:05.995 --> 26:07.872
It's like, why do I believe that?

26:07.955 --> 26:09.123
Where do these lies come from?

26:09.206 --> 26:13.295
And it's like, "Oh, I know,
fucking songs, and books,

26:13.378 --> 26:15.630
and, you know, movies."

26:15.713 --> 26:16.839
All these movies I've watched...

26:16.923 --> 26:18.800
-Mmm-hmm.
-...they're not real.

26:18.883 --> 26:21.844
They're lies. They're lies
like me and Natalie were lies.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.639
You know, it's like...
what am I doing with these?

26:24.722 --> 26:26.391
-Pleasantville?
-Ugh.

26:26.474 --> 26:28.601
It's like, fuck you, Pleasantville.

26:28.685 --> 26:29.769
Just fuck off!

26:29.852 --> 26:32.188
-Whoa! Yeah!
-No, I shouldn't have--

26:32.271 --> 26:34.106
No, I like it. Do it again.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.775
Pretty Woman?

26:35.858 --> 26:38.277
Pretty Woman is such a lie.

26:38.361 --> 26:41.406
Like, a prostitute
wouldn't fall in love with you.

26:41.489 --> 26:45.076
She would just, like,
steal your shit and sell it for coke.

26:45.159 --> 26:46.786
- Fuck you!
- Yeah, do it!

26:46.869 --> 26:48.245
-Go get 'em, tiger!
-Oh, my God, this feels--

26:48.330 --> 26:49.706
It's like, Goodfellas?

26:49.789 --> 26:51.958
It's like, I listen to these
fuckin' commentaries

26:52.041 --> 26:53.876
with Scorsese and it's like,

26:53.960 --> 26:56.003
"Oh, hey, guess what,

26:56.087 --> 26:59.882
uh, all the food in Goodfellas
is based on my mom's recipe."

26:59.966 --> 27:01.008
It's like, who cares?

27:01.092 --> 27:02.677
-Yeah!
-Fucking lies!

27:02.760 --> 27:05.680
Like, go make lasagna with your mom
and leave us alone!

27:05.763 --> 27:07.056
Toy Story 3?

27:07.139 --> 27:09.892
It's like, fuck you, Pixar.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.479
You can't keep it up!
The pressure's too high!

27:12.562 --> 27:14.439
Your movies suck now, Pixar.

27:14.522 --> 27:16.399
Yeah!
Cars 2 was a piece of crap!

27:16.483 --> 27:17.817
Sweet Home Alabama?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.569
-Ugh!
-Lies.

27:19.652 --> 27:21.738
-What Women Want? Lies!
-Ugh!

27:21.821 --> 27:23.072
When Harry Met Sally?

27:23.155 --> 27:24.491
-Fucking lies!
-Lies!

27:24.574 --> 27:27.410
-Homeland season three?
-Very confusing.

27:27.494 --> 27:30.455
Yeah. Like she could ever
just sneak into Iran!

27:30.538 --> 27:32.499
It's like, fuck off!

27:32.582 --> 27:35.126
All these Blu-rays have been
fuckin' weighing me down.

27:35.209 --> 27:36.794
Get it out of my life.

27:38.212 --> 27:41.132
- Fuck!
- Phew!

27:43.593 --> 27:45.803
Why did I throw out
all my Blu-rays?

27:45.887 --> 27:47.805
- It's okay, buddy. You're just tired.

27:47.889 --> 27:49.056
Come on.

27:50.433 --> 27:52.184
- All right, duder.

27:52.268 --> 27:55.021
- Let's get you all snuggled up.

27:55.104 --> 27:57.148
Ugh! I feel like I'm gonna, like--

27:57.231 --> 27:58.816
-Shoes.
-Oh.

28:00.860 --> 28:01.944
I think I might just, like, you know,

28:02.028 --> 28:05.990
I just, like, want to curl up
and, like, watch Armed and Dangerous.

28:06.073 --> 28:07.241
Did I throw that out?

28:07.324 --> 28:09.035
Yeah, you threw 'em all away.

28:09.118 --> 28:11.120
Why?

28:11.203 --> 28:12.955
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.666
I just...
Why did I do that?

28:14.749 --> 28:16.042
I just, like, I'm...

28:17.544 --> 28:20.129
I flipped out in front of you
at Natalie's, like,

28:20.212 --> 28:22.465
I'm so embarrassed.

28:22.549 --> 28:25.760
Dude, I'm the queen of eating shit.
You should never be embarrassed.

28:27.804 --> 28:31.182
I've been waiting for somebody to say
that to me, like, my whole life, so...

28:32.767 --> 28:34.101
means a lot.
Thank you.

28:35.562 --> 28:38.898
Hey, hanging out today was, like...
fun, right?

28:38.981 --> 28:40.567
We had...
It was fun time.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.777
Yeah.
Normally, I hate meeting people,

28:42.860 --> 28:44.361
but I didn't hate you.

28:44.446 --> 28:46.113
Um...

28:47.031 --> 28:48.533
can I get your phone number?

28:48.616 --> 28:49.659
Sure, yeah. Let's do it.

28:49.742 --> 28:50.910
Well, you don't have to or anything.

28:50.993 --> 28:52.912
- No, let's do it.
- It's just...

28:52.995 --> 28:54.080
Might be good.

29:00.587 --> 29:01.754
All right.

29:03.631 --> 29:04.674
Bye.

29:04.757 --> 29:07.301
Bye. Sorry, I'm...

29:12.974 --> 29:14.058
Gus-Gus!

29:14.601 --> 29:16.853
I have that rug, but I have it in orange.

29:17.645 --> 29:19.647
Mmm. I wanted the orange one.

29:24.986 --> 29:26.529
Good night, you little weirdo.

29:28.698 --> 29:30.992
Come on, Fluffy.

29:31.075 --> 29:33.453
- Fluffy!

29:35.497 --> 29:36.581
Hello, Fluffy.

29:36.664 --> 29:38.124
What is this film?

29:38.207 --> 29:41.210
Armed and Dangerous.
That's John Candy.

29:41.293 --> 29:42.419
Who?

29:42.504 --> 29:44.964
Um, have you ever seen Uncle Buck?

29:45.047 --> 29:46.173
Nope.

29:47.675 --> 29:48.885
Uh, Vacation?

29:48.968 --> 29:50.052
I don't know it.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.722
Planes, Trains and Automobiles?

29:52.805 --> 29:54.015
I haven't seen that.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.268
-Splash?
-Of course.

29:57.351 --> 30:00.146
He's the guy who gets hit in the nuts
with the racquetball.

30:00.229 --> 30:02.106
Oh, I love him!

30:03.650 --> 30:06.110
Hey, I got him!

30:08.404 --> 30:10.447
How do you know
about this movie?

30:10.532 --> 30:11.866
Gus told me about it.

30:11.949 --> 30:14.035
He said they filmed it near here.
