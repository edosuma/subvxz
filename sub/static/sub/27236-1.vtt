[Hetfield]
Alright, you need one more, right?

00:24.800 --> 00:26.040
GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN
JULY 2011

00:26.120 --> 00:27.600
-[crowd] Yeah!
-[Hetfield] So do we.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.920
So we wanna turn on the houselights
if that's possible.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.280
'Cause this is what happens
at the end of the Metallica show.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.800
We wanna see the sweat.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.560
We wanna see...

00:39.760 --> 00:43.400
We wanna see
the voices struggling to talk.

00:43.640 --> 00:48.120
We wanna see people just destroyed.
We wanna see the smiles.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.560
-Can we turn on the houselights, please?
-[crowd cheering]

00:51.640 --> 00:55.160
[Hetfield] Thank you, Gothenburg!
The Metallica family!

00:59.480 --> 01:03.000
In July 1966 the Spanish Army raised
a huge graveyard in Burgos.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.560
That cemetery had over 5,000 graves...

01:05.640 --> 01:08.960
...but no one buried in them.

01:14.760 --> 01:20.680
MIRANDILLA VALLEY, BURGOS, SPAIN
SEPTEMBER 2015

01:23.560 --> 01:27.280
When the shooting ended, after July,...

01:27.360 --> 01:28.600
SAD HILL CULTURAL ASSOCIATION

01:28.680 --> 01:31.760
...in the Valley
everything was quickly forgotten.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.240
All film sets were left behind.
The concentration camp, its constructions,

01:36.320 --> 01:39.880
the wood, tents, all was left there.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.120
The trenches with...

01:42.200 --> 01:44.120
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SHOOTING
SEPTEMBER 1966

01:44.200 --> 01:47.120
...all props,
some of the porexpan canyons.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.280
All the crosses and signs at the cemetery.

01:50.360 --> 01:56.080
Some people say
there are crosses from the film

01:56.160 --> 01:58.120
on the rooftops of nearby villages,

01:58.920 --> 02:00.520
to prevent water leaks.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.880
It deteriorated progressively
over 48 years.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.600
Until it became invisible

02:10.240 --> 02:13.520
to anyone walking around.

02:13.600 --> 02:19.280
Nature has done its job,
slowly burying the place.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.280
And at the end,
it lied below 7 inches of soil.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.560
In that summer 1966 people worked
on the film, earned their money,

02:26.960 --> 02:31.200
but no one spoke about it afterwards.
No one spoke about it.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.160
When I first heard about it
I was shocked.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.280
That announcement changed my life.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.640
There's so much said with no words
in this movie...

04:54.720 --> 04:55.720
METALLICA LEAD VOCALIST

04:55.800 --> 04:56.880
...makes it universal.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.360
Almost nothing had come along...

04:58.440 --> 04:59.360
FILM DIRECTOR

04:59.440 --> 05:01.720
...that was as big
as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

05:01.800 --> 05:03.440
Everything is so perfect.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.080
EDITOR
"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY"

05:05.160 --> 05:06.840
The directing, the music,

05:06.920 --> 05:10.600
the production design, the editing.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.840
[Leigh] You could take a single sequence
of that film and frame it

05:13.920 --> 05:16.160
and it would be
a fantastic piece of artwork to have

05:16.240 --> 05:18.600
because there are just
so many individual shots...

05:18.680 --> 05:19.600
FILM CRITIC

05:19.680 --> 05:21.720
...that are stunning to look at
in that film.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.320
It shows the toughness,
it shows the dirtiness,

05:26.400 --> 05:29.520
it shows the unpredictability of the west.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.440
You can watch the film over and over

05:33.520 --> 05:35.440
and see something different every time.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.120
Italian Westerns are more fashionable.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.360
SERGIO LEONE'S BIOGRAPHER

05:38.440 --> 05:41.400
More fashionable design-wise
with the clothes, the production design

05:41.480 --> 05:42.640
and the music.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.400
They're more hip, something sort
of stylish, hence Tarantino.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.720
Ennio Morricone...

05:48.560 --> 05:51.880
The... The soundtrack to that movie

05:52.760 --> 05:55.000
is so horribly great.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.560
This music is considered...

05:58.640 --> 05:59.560
MUSIC COMPOSER

05:59.640 --> 06:01.720
...the second best in the world,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.240
in 100 years of cinema.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.200
I don't remember ever being
as exhilarated

06:07.560 --> 06:11.160
by a movie as I was with
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"

06:11.280 --> 06:15.320
and a large part of that has to do
with the scene in the cemetery.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.560
The cemetery is one of the most
beautiful sequences

06:20.640 --> 06:22.720
in film history.

06:27.120 --> 06:33.000
The plot of the film
was the search of the grave

06:33.080 --> 06:36.640
where the treasure was buried.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.040
This sequence represents
the perfect ending for the film.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.920
You get so much emotion
from that scene.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.440
You can feel every ounce of tension

06:56.520 --> 06:59.960
from each character.
And it's just wonderful filmmaking.

07:00.040 --> 07:04.120
They take scenes
that would ordinarily be

07:04.560 --> 07:07.160
a five minute scene
in an American Western

07:07.240 --> 07:09.000
and it's now a 15-minute scene,

07:09.360 --> 07:11.680
because every nuance is explored.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.920
[Frayling] Luciano Vincenzoni,
the script writer, said to me:

07:15.360 --> 07:19.840
"It said in half a page:
the three of them walk into a cemetery,"

07:20.040 --> 07:22.960
"they have a duel, one of them dies."

07:23.560 --> 07:27.880
And that page or those two pages
became 20 minutes of screen time.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.200
I remember
the first time I saw Leone's movie,

07:34.280 --> 07:37.120
at the cinema in Majorca,
where I lived.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.040
I went with my grandfather.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.840
He took me to the cinema,
I was only five years old,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.080
I didn't know which movie
we were going to see.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.120
Most of all, I remember the music.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.080
We sat down, lights turned off
and when the first notes sounded

07:52.240 --> 07:54.800
I was blown away
by what I was listening to.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.080
I saw it as a kid,
most likely in black and white.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.560
And what I do remember is
when I bought my first VHS.

08:02.640 --> 08:06.200
It had a cropped 4:3 format for TV.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.240
So the duel sequence was a mess.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.840
We had a relief teacher at school...

08:09.920 --> 08:11.760
CELL BIOLOGY PROFESSOR
AT MUNSTER UNIVERSITY

08:11.840 --> 08:13.480
...and he talked about this movie.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
AUTHOR "BEHIND THE SCENES: SERGIO
LEONE'S GBU"

08:15.640 --> 08:17.240
He talked about this film about three...

08:17.320 --> 08:20.840
protagonists looking for 200,000
dollars in buried gold

08:20.920 --> 08:22.680
during the American Civil War.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.240
And he described it
in such a great way,

08:25.320 --> 08:27.720
sort of the way
that maybe Sergio Leone

08:27.800 --> 08:30.600
or Christopher Frayling
would describe the story,

08:30.680 --> 08:34.159
it was really exciting, and I thought:
"Wow, I have to see this movie."

08:34.280 --> 08:38.320
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",
I think I was predestined to it

08:38.400 --> 08:40.840
because my father is from
Quintanarraya,

08:40.919 --> 08:45.680
a village 30 minutes away
from the filming location,

08:45.760 --> 08:50.040
and my mother is from Gérgal,
in Almería, a town near Tabernas Desert.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.520
When we went to Almería we visited
MiniHollywood and the desert,

08:54.640 --> 08:57.120
and watched western movies.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.720
As a child I watched the movie
with my father and my uncles

09:00.960 --> 09:03.760
I knew nothing about
Leone nor Eastwood,

09:04.160 --> 09:08.040
but I just loved them.
I watched them a thousand times.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.920
After a long time watching

09:12.160 --> 09:14.720
and revisiting Leone's movies

09:14.880 --> 09:19.440
I began to hear people's stories
saying they had worked in the movie,

09:19.520 --> 09:23.200
one played as extra,
others talked about the bridge story.

09:23.400 --> 09:28.480
So I started to investigate into
the film they were talking about.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.280
And it was
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",

09:31.360 --> 09:34.760
and the cemetery was
a few miles from where I lived.

09:35.080 --> 09:40.080
And there's people researching,
passionate about the subject.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.240
I knew the locations
since I was a kid.

09:42.520 --> 09:46.000
We went to the cemetery
with our bikes.

09:46.320 --> 09:51.920
But it got serious when we opened
the Dinosaurs Museum in Salas,...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.440
SALAS ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTIVE

09:53.520 --> 09:57.600
...and some tourists came asking about
locations with pictures taken from a TV.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.000
BETTERVILLE CONCENTRATION CAMP

09:59.080 --> 10:03.320
And that's when we became
interested in finding

10:03.400 --> 10:04.800
exactly every location.

10:04.880 --> 10:10.680
If you put together Morricone's music
with having enjoyed these places,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.040
and suddenly realising

10:12.200 --> 10:14.960
your grandfather worked in the film,

10:15.800 --> 10:18.200
that left a big mark inside me.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.840
Big enough to make me look for information

10:21.920 --> 10:25.160
about what happened here
in the summer of 1966.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.080
The film starts...

10:28.360 --> 10:31.400
My new film,
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"...

10:31.480 --> 10:32.680
SERGIO LEONE INTERVIEW, 1966

10:32.760 --> 10:36.760
...you could say it is

10:37.880 --> 10:41.160
an epic picaresque western because...

10:41.720 --> 10:46.440
it is the story of three magnificent
and funny scoundrels

10:47.160 --> 10:50.960
during the American Civil War.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.600
It begins as a classic western...

10:58.480 --> 11:03.000
in a little village from the Far West.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.640
At the premiere for "A few dollars more",

11:08.720 --> 11:11.120
Leone was approached
by producers from United Artists

11:11.200 --> 11:15.800
who offered him a huge budget
to realise the third film in the trilogy.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.960
So for him it was finally
an opportunity...

11:18.040 --> 11:19.000
"FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE"

11:19.080 --> 11:20.440
...to go as big as he wanted

11:20.560 --> 11:25.280
and to create a film that was
on the largest scale imaginable.

11:25.480 --> 11:30.520
Leone's career is so strange
in those 3 years, 1964, 1965, 1966.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.680
1964 "Fistful of dollars",
budget 200,000 dollars.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.600
Huge success in Italy.
Immediately on the back of it

11:38.680 --> 11:41.800
"For a few dollars more",
budget 600,000 dollars.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.960
The most successful film ever made
in Italy at that time.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.280
Right on the back of that

11:46.360 --> 11:49.800
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",
budget 1.3 million dollars.

11:49.880 --> 11:54.680
So he is going from 200,000 dollars
to 1.3 million dollars in 2.5 years.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.400
Certainly, the third western film
of Sergio Leone

11:58.560 --> 12:01.680
is where he had improved exponentially,

12:01.760 --> 12:03.960
even if before
it was already very high.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.720
After editing
"For a few dollars more",

12:08.440 --> 12:10.720
Sergio Leone whom I loved, said:

12:10.800 --> 12:14.200
"I'm doing a new film
'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly',

12:14.280 --> 12:15.880
I want the editor

12:16.520 --> 12:19.280
to be in Spain with me."

12:19.640 --> 12:22.400
In fact, the first part of the film

12:22.480 --> 12:25.760
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
was shot in Almería.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.600
[man] Western and American epic movies

12:29.680 --> 12:31.920
have impressive landscapes
at their disposal.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.520
"SPAIN: AN INTERNATIONAL FILM SET"

12:33.600 --> 12:35.400
Spain presents a varied topography

12:35.480 --> 12:39.040
with a wide range of natural
cinematographic scenarios.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.120
-Settlements accurately reconstructed.
-[shooting]

12:42.200 --> 12:46.400
[saloon music]

12:46.680 --> 12:50.640
[man] Even if it is easy to find out
what's behind the façades.

12:54.760 --> 12:58.040
As the movie takes place
during the American Civil War

12:58.120 --> 13:01.400
Leone had secured locations
in Madrid and Almería

13:01.880 --> 13:05.280
but he soon realised he would require
greener locations as well.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.680
[Frayling] Leone once said that

13:07.760 --> 13:09.520
Northern Spain is like Virginia,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.840
Southern Spain is like
Arizona and New Mexico.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.600
'Betterville Concentration Camp'
was the first location,

13:16.680 --> 13:21.360
in Carazo,
and during those days they decide

13:21.680 --> 13:24.080
to locate the cemetery
in Mirandilla Valley,

13:24.160 --> 13:26.200
between Santo Domingo de Silos
and Contreras.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.600
-That's the cemetery!
-Wow!

13:30.800 --> 13:35.560
Holy shit! Oh man! Oh, my God!

13:35.920 --> 13:38.000
We found it! This is it!

13:38.080 --> 13:40.640
CANADIAN FILM FANS WILL ROSS,
DEVAN SCOTT AND DANIEL JEFFERY

13:40.720 --> 13:43.200
VISIT SAD HILL CEMETERY
FOR THE FIRST TIME, SEPTEMBER 2014

13:43.280 --> 13:48.000
-We are on one of the mountains!
-I know! I didn't expect this!

13:48.320 --> 13:49.600
Holy shit!

13:50.920 --> 13:53.640
This is one of the coolest
moments of my life.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.600
This is honestly like...
This is out there with the greats.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.920
-Daniel, isn't this the coolest thing?
-It's pretty cool.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.680
I just can't believe we found it.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.320
It's like going to Disneyland
and no one's there.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.240
[Daniel] Yeah.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.800
Except it's not a recreation,
it's the Magical Kingdom.

14:08.880 --> 14:09.800
[Daniel] Yeah.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.520
The first time we saw the cemetery
we didn't even realise we were there.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.200
-[interferences and screeching noises]
-[man] We're having...

14:19.280 --> 14:21.960
JOSEBA AND HIS FRIENDS
ARRIVE AT MIRANDILLA VALLEY

14:22.040 --> 14:23.960
LOOKING FOR FILM LOCATIONS
MAY 1996

14:24.280 --> 14:27.480
It was when we reached
the summit of San Carlos

14:27.560 --> 14:30.800
and we saw
the concentric circles from above.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.680
I realised that was the location of
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

14:36.680 --> 14:39.800
[man on the recording] And there we can
see "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

14:40.320 --> 14:43.040
I remember watching the film on TV,

14:43.880 --> 14:46.360
trying to memorise
the shape of the mountains...

14:46.440 --> 14:47.600
THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY

14:47.680 --> 14:49.960
...so we could go later
and find the exact spot.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.720
Once I found the location, I told David,

14:53.920 --> 14:57.320
"Why don't we go some day
and place the movie's main tombs?"

14:57.640 --> 14:59.880
"Arch Stanton and Unknown."

15:00.000 --> 15:04.080
We photoshopped some replicas,
I used my father's miter saw

15:04.160 --> 15:06.160
to cut some old boards.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.760
[boy] I always thought the location was
exquisitely beautiful and perfect

15:10.880 --> 15:14.400
and that it would be amazing
to lay my eyes on it.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.200
[boy 2] The geography plays such a part
in telling the emotional story

15:19.360 --> 15:22.880
that for me seeing it myself
became quite important.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.120
[boy 3] Oh, my God,
you can see the mounts.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.080
[whispering] You can see the mounts.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.960
Here is Arch Stanton and Unknown.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.080
Man, am I grateful to the fans
who put this together?

15:42.160 --> 15:45.000
[boy 2] It's like going to ruins
that haven't been touched by men.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.840
It's the best preserved place I've been
with no preservation work done.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.200
You know? Like it really looks
almost the exact same.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.760
For me, that place is magical. It's like
being in another world, in the film.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.880
[Montero] I love walking around
when it's empty.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
It's a pleasure.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.520
There is barely any noise.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.920
It's a little paradise.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.160
Being there...
You can shoot not just a western,

16:15.240 --> 16:18.160
you could shoot a movie
about Neanderthals.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.200
There are no power lines,
no TV antennas,

16:21.280 --> 16:24.320
I think the landscape is just impressive.

16:28.920 --> 16:34.680
I remember that here in Sierra
de la Demanda, a magazine came out.

16:35.160 --> 16:39.600
For the first time I realised
there was someone, somewhere,

16:39.680 --> 16:42.000
also researching about the film.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.240
I was very impressed by a picture
of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef,

16:46.840 --> 16:48.080
and a Civil Guard,

16:48.280 --> 16:50.560
taken at the cemetery.
We didn't know it,

16:50.640 --> 16:54.720
but it had been published in a book
by Cineteca Nazionale di Roma.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.640
And I became interested

16:58.440 --> 17:01.880
in behind-the-scenes photos
that might be kept by the locals.

17:02.240 --> 17:07.800
Diego had been investigating
and looking for locations for years.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.560
We started speaking
and sharing materials.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.079
He already had many old photos.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.440
I collected photos from neighbours
who worked in the movie.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.240
I met more people and we started sharing
everything we found.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.560
[Del Valle] When Eli Wallach passed away,

17:25.359 --> 17:31.000
many people got together
at the stoned circle in Sad Hill.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.960
Members of the Association were there,
and that's where I met...

17:34.040 --> 17:36.040
ELI WALLACH TRIBUTE
JULY 2014

17:36.120 --> 17:37.520
...Sergio and David.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.720
And this has been part
of the excitement to me

17:41.800 --> 17:45.800
because I met a lot of great people
and we spent unforgettable moments.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.680
That's the genesis of the Association.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.800
Seeing that we were not only
a couple of fools.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.840
We saw there was a lot of people
that could participate.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.280
That's where we spoke about
the 50th anniversary.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.840
Somebody said: "We have to make
something big for the 50th anniversary.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.640
It has to be great."

18:03.880 --> 18:07.880
We thought we could bring in the hoes
and see what happened.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.640
When we hit the ground

18:09.720 --> 18:12.760
and found the first stone,
we were shocked.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.760
So we decided we had to do the effort
and restore the cemetery.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.240
I thought it was crazy,
I honestly thought that was insane.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.520
Wonderfully crazy, but crazy.

18:24.920 --> 18:29.080
The idea was to restore it
so that others could enjoy it.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.040
For all these westerns
and adventure films made in Almería

18:37.120 --> 18:39.080
and in Burgos and all over Spain

18:39.160 --> 18:42.640
you had the sort of tacit approval
of the Franco regime.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.360
There's an interesting quote
from Eastwood.

18:45.440 --> 18:49.680
Clint Eastwood did a seminar at
the Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.520
And somebody says to him: "Did anyone
object? Because the film is anti-war.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.680
It's quite liberal in its politics.
It's very cynical about nationalism.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.960
Uniforms and all this sort of thing.
Did anyone object?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.200
Was there any censorship?"
And Eastwood says: "Look.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.400
If it'd been a film about Spain

19:06.720 --> 19:09.960
or about the Spanish Civil War
or about Spanish troops,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.440
yeah, there would have been
a lot of problems.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.120
They couldn't have got to first place.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.640
But with the wild west,
they didn't give a damn."

19:17.120 --> 19:20.840
Today it's difficult
not to include politics in a film,

19:20.920 --> 19:22.160
it comes in on its own.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.560
SERGIO LEONE INTERVIEW, 1977

19:23.640 --> 19:29.880
So a more serious approach is to make...

19:30.160 --> 19:33.760
From my point of view,
that I share with others

19:34.120 --> 19:36.960
more important than me,
for example, Chaplin,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.120
is to make, to speak through...
The show needs to be a vehicle,

19:42.200 --> 19:46.760
a bicycle to be able to make
certain arguments we are interested in,

19:46.840 --> 19:49.480
but without taking a position, because...

19:49.920 --> 19:53.800
taking a position means making a claim.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.920
This is a type of cinema
that I don't like.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.600
The original idea was to get
local villagers

19:59.680 --> 20:03.400
to help out with the creation of sets
but also play as extras,

20:03.840 --> 20:06.520
but it quickly became very chaotic.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.880
So they decided to turn to the Spanish
army who were more reliable.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.360
Franco's Government, there was Franco
at that point in Spain,...

20:13.440 --> 20:15.440
CAMERA ASSISTANT
"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY"

20:15.520 --> 20:17.760
...helped Leone
because he had brought many movies,

20:17.840 --> 20:22.440
lots of money to make
Italian, French, Spanish movies.

20:22.920 --> 20:27.080
So they gave him a thousand soldiers

20:27.520 --> 20:30.200
with the captain and the general.

20:30.440 --> 20:35.000
Back then, military service
was mandatory for young people

20:35.240 --> 20:39.480
and the San Marcial Quarters
located in Burgos, and today disappeared,

20:39.640 --> 20:44.240
gave the manpower that the Italians
and the Americans were looking for

20:44.480 --> 20:47.280
to work both in
the construction of the sets

20:47.360 --> 20:52.040
and play as extras in the shooting.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.520
In one of the letters
from Aldo Pomiglia

20:55.200 --> 20:59.240
he mentions they will give
75,000 pesetas to those quarters.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.440
The San Marcial Quarters
in Burgos, for the orphans.

21:02.880 --> 21:07.800
Overnight they brought us
from the barracks to make a movie.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.960
MILITARY SERVICE IN 1966

21:09.040 --> 21:12.400
Looks like they made a contract
with the military government.

21:12.560 --> 21:17.800
They brought us to this region,
to the town of Hortigüela.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.160
In Hortigüela

21:19.240 --> 21:23.400
we stayed in a military service camp.

21:23.640 --> 21:27.160
And then every day
we had something to do:

21:27.240 --> 21:28.680
repair things,

21:29.120 --> 21:32.000
build the bridge, build the cemetery.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.600
It was huge. And you got paid for it:
250 pesetas per day.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.720
Even bars opened in Hortigüela.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.520
And if you did something else,
like playing dead in the water,

21:44.680 --> 21:47.840
they paid you more.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.400
That was our job and many days
we didn't have anything to do.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.760
It was a vacation. Just like those trips

21:56.600 --> 21:58.720
with the boy scouts. Same thing.

22:07.680 --> 22:14.480
OCTOBER 2015

22:32.200 --> 22:35.240
[García] The first days with the hoe
were frustrating

22:35.320 --> 22:37.680
because it didn't come out easily,

22:37.760 --> 22:40.720
even if many people came,
it was arduous.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.360
Hard work, because you have to dig
considering 7 inches below

22:45.440 --> 22:48.360
are the stones that can't be touched,
they are sacred.

22:52.840 --> 22:56.600
[men speaking indistinctly]

22:56.680 --> 23:01.320
So we decided that patience
and perseverance was the key.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.160
It was almost like archaeology.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.680
I asked for a big broom
to a guy from Segovia.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.920
People came closer
and we saw that it was a reality.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.320
The stones were there,
you could see them.

23:18.840 --> 23:25.360
Something I had fought for
all my life was becoming real.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.160
Maybe people don't understand how

23:28.240 --> 23:30.600
a person has dreams
about a film location.

23:30.680 --> 23:31.880
Well, for me...

23:32.720 --> 23:35.960
It's a magic place. A magic place.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.640
[Montero] We thought it would take
two weekends, but it took longer.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.400
It got a bit out of hands.

24:32.080 --> 24:37.000
We decided we had to launch a call
for all the film fans

24:37.280 --> 24:40.120
and we used social networks.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.120
We created a website,
a Facebook page,

24:43.200 --> 24:47.040
and through volunteer calls

24:47.120 --> 24:51.720
we managed to transform
every weekend in a pilgrimage

24:51.800 --> 24:54.760
with shovel, hoe, and really excited

24:54.880 --> 24:57.240
about seeing it as it was in the film.

24:57.480 --> 25:01.200
We managed to get people
from all over Spain,

25:01.320 --> 25:03.800
even from France and Italy.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.680
And then you see there is people
that is even more freak, more fan.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.280
[Alba] Seeing all the people
that have gone there to work really hard,

25:13.360 --> 25:17.440
to carry wheelbarrows, picking
and shovelling, has been beautiful.

25:20.800 --> 25:25.120
NOVEMBER 2015

25:25.280 --> 25:27.040
[man] I have found a stone!

25:27.600 --> 25:30.360
I've found a stone! There.
Shit, no is not.

25:30.640 --> 25:31.720
There.

25:33.440 --> 25:38.720
I visited Tabernas Desert and I have found
out that four...

25:38.800 --> 25:39.800
VOLUNTEER AT SAD HILL

25:39.880 --> 25:41.960
scenes of the film were shot in Burgos.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.080
This is the fourth time that I come

25:47.880 --> 25:49.680
to Burgos to help the Association

25:50.160 --> 25:51.000
to dig.

25:51.080 --> 25:54.360
It is a dream
that we've had for a long time

25:54.440 --> 25:56.680
since we got married in 1976,

25:56.760 --> 26:00.880
the time when the Spaghetti movies
from Leone were released

26:01.200 --> 26:04.400
and we saw them again and again,

26:04.480 --> 26:09.760
and we fell in love with
the culture of those western films.

26:09.880 --> 26:15.080
So I hope that the cemetery
is brought back to its original status

26:15.240 --> 26:18.520
and I hope
that many Spanish and European people

26:18.600 --> 26:22.040
will come to celebrate
this mythic location.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.280
[Del Valle] I wonder,

26:28.080 --> 26:31.800
why would somebody come from France
to help restore the place,

26:32.400 --> 26:33.880
with his hoe and his shovel?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.400
Can someone understand that?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.960
Cinema takes you
to impossible places.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.280
Cinema means being in places
you could never be in real life.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.640
FILM DIRECTOR

26:51.720 --> 26:56.560
And suddenly discover that they do exist
as part of an unknown territory

26:56.680 --> 27:00.360
where you can become an archaeologist

27:00.440 --> 27:02.800
and find it. I think it's fascinating.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.640
I'm not surprised
that people want to unearth the cemetery.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.240
It is something
that I would like to do too,

27:08.320 --> 27:11.400
because it makes our dreams more real.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.280
And that is a fantastic feeling.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.520
Why do they wanna go
and recreate the cemetery?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.720
No explanation needed. I mean...

27:21.160 --> 27:23.880
You wanna give back,
you wanna feel part of.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.800
You wanna feel like you're involved
in something that has shaped your life.

27:27.880 --> 27:32.000
I think it is a need to be
part of something eternal.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.480
Everyone carries this around,
it's part of our culture.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.240
And is worldwide.
It's the reason why we restore films

27:38.320 --> 27:42.640
and save negatives
and all the things that could go away.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.840
It's a very ephemeral world

27:43.920 --> 27:48.040
and the idea of unearth something
that means something to you

27:48.360 --> 27:51.640
and do it not just for yourself
but for the greater good

27:51.720 --> 27:54.160
of everybody who cares
about this subject.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.880
It's altruism in its finest form.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.080
I think it is wonderful
that all these volunteers

28:00.160 --> 28:03.160
have been helping
to restore the location of...

28:03.240 --> 28:05.840
'Cause it is one
of the greatest locations

28:05.920 --> 28:09.160
of the duel on the cemetery from
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

28:09.240 --> 28:13.120
But it doesn't surprise me.
It's a piece of magic in your life

28:13.400 --> 28:15.320
getting involved in this project.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.240
[Alabiso] The cemetery is a construction

28:19.320 --> 28:24.160
that will prevail in the history of cinema
for 1,000 years.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.840
Maybe all these volunteers
want to make history as well.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.880
[Hetfield] I think artists are still...

28:41.560 --> 28:43.160
You know they are insecure,

28:43.240 --> 28:45.880
and they don't know
really who they are yet,

28:45.960 --> 28:48.040
and that's how they express the art,

28:48.120 --> 28:50.360
that's how they get the things
out there and do these...

28:51.160 --> 28:52.240
interesting things.

28:53.080 --> 28:57.080
And I think the fans are young as well,
they're on that same wavelength,

28:57.200 --> 28:59.560
looking for something

28:59.640 --> 29:00.840
for meaning in life.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.840
It's the greatest dream.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.280
To touch the stones
where Clint Eastwood stood.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.760
I would say that's a reason
big enough to unearth them.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.480
[Hetfield] So one more song for you.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.840
GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN
JULY 2011

29:17.920 --> 29:21.920
And we hope you have a voice because
we need you singing on this one, ok?

29:23.560 --> 29:26.120
And you are going
to help us count it in, alright?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.480
-¡1, 2, 3, 4!
-[crowd] ¡1, 2, 3, 4!

29:29.560 --> 29:32.160
-¡1, 2, 3, 4!
-¡1, 2, 3, 4!

29:32.240 --> 29:34.560
-¡1, 2, 3, 4!
-¡1, 2, 3, 4!

29:36.840 --> 29:39.400
You're in the middle of a movie
that already looks expensive,

29:39.480 --> 29:41.160
and all of the sudden the camera pans

29:41.240 --> 29:43.520
and the entire civil war is in the shot.

29:43.600 --> 29:49.160
There were two hills like this,
in the middle of nature and below

29:49.240 --> 29:50.880
there was a stream

29:51.560 --> 29:55.560
that separated on one side the North,
on the other the South.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.160
[Urrutia] We had to shoot
the Langstone...

29:59.560 --> 30:02.920
Bridge scenes in the Arlanza river.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.400
Trenches were placed in one hill

30:06.680 --> 30:09.240
and I remember temperatures reached

30:10.000 --> 30:12.040
40º degrees Celsius
and over that summer.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.280
Then in the morning
they didn't dress as soldiers

30:15.360 --> 30:21.720
but with the costumes that Sergio Leone
and the costume designer had.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.440
"Confederate for you,
unionist for you."

30:24.520 --> 30:28.480
Hey, I need 200 people dressed as X.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.080
Then they got 200 soldiers,
gave them clothes,

30:31.160 --> 30:35.240
and they prepared the backpack
and everything to act as extras.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.680
I was in the South
against the North in the bridge.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.360
We met there and sometimes
we fought for real

30:43.920 --> 30:48.560
because the Civil Guard
let us use blaze Winchesters

30:48.640 --> 30:52.600
and every time you shot,
powder came out into the eyes

30:52.680 --> 30:53.920
and it hurt.

30:54.040 --> 30:57.600
[Urrutia] Sergio Leone was very demanding.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.560
I don't know if he was a perfectionist,

31:00.880 --> 31:03.200
but he repeated the same scene
over and over.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.600
And every time he said "molto bene".

31:08.200 --> 31:11.360
And I wondered:
"If 'molto bene', why do we repeat it?"

31:20.160 --> 31:23.280
[Frayling] They got the assistance
of the Spanish Army

31:23.360 --> 31:27.720
both for building but also
the explosives people for the bridge.

31:27.800 --> 31:31.280
Usually on a film production
the technical crew would be in charge

31:31.360 --> 31:33.680
of special effects and explosions.

31:33.760 --> 31:38.680
[Hanley] But for blowing up the bridge
they needed TNT so they relied

31:38.760 --> 31:43.000
on experts from the Burgos' Army
who knew where to place the explosives

31:43.080 --> 31:47.560
and how to make sure
you got a chain reaction

31:47.640 --> 31:50.440
that the bridge blew up
almost simultaneously.

31:50.560 --> 31:55.160
Most likely everyone tells
the bridge story as he likes.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.760
Do you want the truth about the bridge?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.840
Who was responsible?
Everyone washes their hands of it.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.120
[Salvati] It was 8 am,

32:06.200 --> 32:08.600
Sergio Leone approaches me and says,

32:09.400 --> 32:13.320
like this: "Today you are on your own

32:13.400 --> 32:17.920
operating the slow motion camera,
the one that goes at 200 frames."

32:18.160 --> 32:20.040
"What do you mean I am alone?

32:20.120 --> 32:22.640
Don't we have the Spanish, the Italians?"

32:22.760 --> 32:27.880
"Take care of the camera, you know it.
You're on your own. Get into the shelter.

32:28.120 --> 32:32.040
You are responsible today,
my trusted camera operator."

32:32.160 --> 32:36.720
Sergio came to me and said:
"You and Eli,

32:36.800 --> 32:39.480
I want you guys to be sitting
right up here in the front...

32:39.560 --> 32:41.280
BLONDIE
IN "THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY"

32:41.360 --> 32:43.320
...and there is a little ditch

32:43.400 --> 32:47.600
that you could lie in
and you'll be quite safe there".

32:47.760 --> 32:51.080
And I said: "Where are you
going to be, Sergio?"

32:51.360 --> 32:54.760
And he said: "I'm going to be
back up on the hill over there".

32:56.200 --> 32:57.920
I said: " You know where I'm gonna be?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.400
I'm gonna be right next
to you up on that hill."

33:00.480 --> 33:04.840
So we all came on the hill, they put
two guys on our wardrobe really fast

33:04.960 --> 33:07.160
and stuck them
right there in the front.

33:07.280 --> 33:12.360
All seven camera operators
are given a little telephone

33:12.440 --> 33:17.080
not a telephone, a walkie talkie
from that time, 50 years ago.

33:17.160 --> 33:21.200
The order was like this:
"Camera one, rolling.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.320
Camera two: rolling.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.680
Camera Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven."

33:26.800 --> 33:29.120
And then he had to say "Action".

33:30.400 --> 33:34.640
The lieutenant,
proud to be in front of the director

33:35.320 --> 33:38.760
asks if he can give

33:38.920 --> 33:42.520
the signal
for the explosion of the bridge.

33:42.800 --> 33:48.280
Leone says, "Yes, I allow you,
you can give the signal.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.440
All you have to do is
shake the handkerchief in your hand,

33:51.880 --> 33:54.160
and they will detonate the bridge."

33:54.600 --> 33:57.360
The lieutenant proudly says:

33:57.440 --> 34:02.080
"Then Mr. Director, all I have to do
is move it like this and the br..."

34:02.160 --> 34:02.960
[explosion]

34:03.040 --> 34:07.800
He couldn't say "bridge explodes".
It had already exploded.

34:12.040 --> 34:17.719
At some point I hear an explosion
and the bridge is blowing away.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.199
And I start rolling.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.280
It was huge, there were logs
and there were rocks coming back

34:23.360 --> 34:26.320
and the poor doubles that were out there

34:26.400 --> 34:30.480
just luckily got out of the way,
rocks were flying over their heads.

34:30.560 --> 34:35.280
Sergio Leone didn't have
the courage to turn around

34:35.360 --> 34:38.080
to look at the bridge that had exploded.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.280
We didn't know that up on the hill.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.600
We thought: "They've blown up
the bridge, that's spectacular."

34:43.719 --> 34:46.639
And then, all of the sudden,
Sergio comes walking down the road

34:46.719 --> 34:49.040
and he's fuming, he's absolutely red.

34:49.120 --> 34:53.040
And I just leaned over jokingly
and I said to Elli Wallach. I said...

34:54.280 --> 34:56.360
"They probably didn't have
the cameras rolling."

34:56.639 --> 35:02.120
And sure now Sergio comes out
and starts swearing like mad in Italian.

35:02.200 --> 35:07.960
I started crying, crying but crying like
I have never cried in my life.

35:08.040 --> 35:08.920
I quit.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.560
What will my father say when he learns

35:11.640 --> 35:15.240
that I haven't heard the order
from Sergio, "Action".

35:15.320 --> 35:18.760
The Spanish Army captain didn't know
that when you do a shot

35:18.840 --> 35:22.960
you have to say "ready",
get the cameras rolling, the clapperboard,

35:23.040 --> 35:26.800
so when they hear "vai",
he hit the switch.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.240
With the languages mess,

35:30.360 --> 35:34.880
with people speaking in English,
Italian, Spanish, it was a chaos.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.920
He understood some gesture from Sergio,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.040
the camera operator,
Tonino Delli Colli or...

35:41.400 --> 35:45.200
someone that maybe said
"we are ready" and he said "ready".

35:45.360 --> 35:49.720
Now this general or colonel,
I don't know what rank he had.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.960
He said, "In two days we fix the bridge".

35:54.200 --> 35:56.120
We went down to Almería

35:56.200 --> 35:59.720
and we filmed for a week or so,
down there, two weeks,

35:59.880 --> 36:03.960
while they rebuilt the bridge
and we came back and blew it up again.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.760
[yelling]

36:16.600 --> 36:17.880
[motor revving]

36:23.320 --> 36:26.880
JANUARY 2016

36:26.960 --> 36:28.720
-[chainsaw]
-[man] Let's do it.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.720
[García] Sometimes it's frustrating

37:00.800 --> 37:04.800
because you make the call
and maybe eight people show up.

37:05.120 --> 37:09.680
You work hard digging for some hours
and you can't hardly notice it.

37:09.920 --> 37:16.440
Luckily, other times 40 people come
and in two hours we progress a lot.

37:16.520 --> 37:22.520
But it can be frustrating, it feels like
you are never going to finish.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.600
It wasn't clear to me that
we would rebuild the cemetery.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.640
Uncovering the pavement was doable.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.920
But placing the graves
felt more complicated.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.000
I felt overwhelmed.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.480
And...

37:50.880 --> 37:53.160
when you feel unable

37:53.240 --> 37:57.480
to carry out a job of such magnitude,

37:58.120 --> 38:01.200
you have to stop and think:

38:01.960 --> 38:03.240
I can't make it alone.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.400
Then we came up with...

38:05.960 --> 38:09.760
the brilliant idea of sponsoring a grave.

38:10.040 --> 38:15.160
It was just a joke. "Sponsor a grave
and be part of the Sad Hill cemetery."

38:15.240 --> 38:18.600
I proposed it and we laughed about it.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.520
The idea was to set a symbolic price,

38:20.960 --> 38:24.960
as a way to attract people.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.440
We used that money to buy material,

38:28.560 --> 38:32.240
wood and paint to write the name,

38:32.320 --> 38:37.640
raise the cross and remove the grass
that covered the grave.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
MARCH 2016

38:43.160 --> 38:45.960
[García] I think it's on the verge of...

38:47.160 --> 38:49.720
bad taste, I'm not sure.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.640
I'm not superstitious but...

38:55.880 --> 39:00.480
Some people say it's a great idea,
other say it's macabre.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.880
No, putting your name
on a grave, I mean,

39:03.520 --> 39:06.320
it's not like it's a real grave.
I mean, it's... Yeah.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.360
It's...

39:07.840 --> 39:09.920
I think it's cool, I think it'd be great.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.640
It's very cool to have your name
on a grave, I mean, come on.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.600
If I had known about it,
I'd have my name on a grave.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.680
So who wants to be buried there?

39:17.760 --> 39:21.200
It's gotta be somebody
who loves it so much

39:21.280 --> 39:23.960
they wanna actually
be buried at the cemetery.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.840
It's just a fake cemetery.
I mean, it's just...

39:28.400 --> 39:29.560
It's funny.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.440
[Alba] Here I read Iván López

39:31.520 --> 39:35.040
but you didn't give
the name of the other sponsor.

39:35.120 --> 39:39.600
-Oh, yes. It was Amadeo.
-OK. That one is missing.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.840
And it's time to bring out
infinite lists of sponsors.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.520
-"Have you painted this one?
- No, I already did..."

39:54.120 --> 39:55.200
Very tedious.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.760
[Alba] We didn't take it seriously
at the beginning.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.120
Let's see if we place 10 or 15,

40:03.200 --> 40:06.440
and suddenly there were
not 10 or 15, but 1,000.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.840
[Montero] And the idea is to follow up

40:16.920 --> 40:20.360
to the original
four or five thousand graves.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.480
All these people contributing,

40:24.600 --> 40:31.080
with the same passion and faith
in what we believed in...

40:31.160 --> 40:33.920
That was the key to success.

40:48.280 --> 40:53.160
Go get a square cross.
One with room for two.

40:53.240 --> 40:57.240
Or just one big enough for two names:
Elena and Bolo.

41:00.840 --> 41:04.120
MAY 2016

41:15.040 --> 41:17.720
Seeing the first graves in place

41:18.200 --> 41:21.040
gave us the energy to prepare

41:21.200 --> 41:23.840
the celebration of the 50th anniversary.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.880
We agreed we had to do something,
50 years is a special number.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.760
We were looking forward to it

41:29.840 --> 41:33.600
and we wanted to have
the cemetery ready by then.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.800
We set the date

41:36.760 --> 41:39.800
on the 24th July
for the screening of the film

41:40.040 --> 41:44.720
because it was the closest
to the shooting date 50 years ago.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.520
Let's do it.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.640
Right there.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.520
That's the place.

42:18.760 --> 42:23.480
I am going to fill it with soil on top, so
the feet are cut so it stays above ground.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.240
-It'll be more visible.
-Now? A bit more?

42:42.480 --> 42:46.280
While we filmed
the war scenes in the bridge,

42:46.360 --> 42:49.720
between the North and the South,

42:50.160 --> 42:54.760
at the other side of the mountain
from where the bridge was shot,

42:54.840 --> 42:58.120
they were building the cemetery.

42:59.320 --> 43:03.280
Originally in the script the idea
was a fairly small cemetery.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.280
Then they decided to get
bigger and bigger.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
ORIGINAL STUDIO DESIGNS

43:06.440 --> 43:09.920
Leone kept saying, "10,000 graves, I'll
have the biggest cemetery of all time."

43:10.000 --> 43:11.120
So they needed help.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.760
And as with the bridge they got
the assistance of the Spanish army.

43:15.840 --> 43:22.080
They took almost all of us
to the cemetery, to make the graves.

43:22.480 --> 43:26.600
It was a box.
Rather four boards with two hangers.

43:26.920 --> 43:30.720
Then we filled it with soil,
squashed it a bit,

43:31.040 --> 43:32.920
raised it, and it was done.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.360
Then someone set the cross
or a stake with a name.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.880
That was the cemetery.

43:40.920 --> 43:44.640
There's a concentration camp,
Betterville Concentration Camp,

43:44.720 --> 43:46.520
reference to the Second World War

43:46.600 --> 43:48.920
and at the battle of the bridge
there's all these trenches

43:49.080 --> 43:52.400
which are completely anachronistic,
but that's the I World War.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.520
So when you get to the cemetery,
it's a war cemetery from the I World War

43:56.600 --> 43:59.120
basically transposed
to the American Civil War.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.400
It's like one of those huge,
very touching

44:03.000 --> 44:06.120
cemeteries you find in Northern France,
of the Battle of the Somme.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.960
Thousands and thousands
of uniform crosses.

44:10.480 --> 44:16.720
What did I feel when I saw the cemetery
finished for the first time?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.720
I was shocked.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.680
I wondered how was it possible

44:22.960 --> 44:27.080
to make such
a beautiful cemetery for fiction.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.120
I had no idea
what the cemetery was gonna look like.

44:31.200 --> 44:35.080
When I got there it was circular
which I thought was rather unique.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.760
Because originally, a cemetery,
you just think of rows of gravestones.

44:41.040 --> 44:44.960
But they had made it a circle
which I thought was very conducive

44:45.040 --> 44:48.200
to the camera angles and the view.

44:48.720 --> 44:52.480
The original plan was always to put
the camera quite a long way away

44:52.560 --> 44:54.480
to get the whole panorama of it.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.640
And get closer and closer
as the duel progressed.

44:57.720 --> 45:00.680
And you juxtapose
these extraordinary, extreme close-ups

45:00.760 --> 45:04.680
with the long shots of the three of them
standing in this arena,

45:04.760 --> 45:09.000
and is like the coliseum,
is like a sword and sandal movie

45:09.080 --> 45:11.080
with gladiators coming into the arena.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.640
The "Arena of Destiny",
Sergio Leone called it.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.720
The original plan was actually
to do an aerial shot in that sequence

45:18.080 --> 45:20.800
and it was going
to be done using a helicopter

45:20.960 --> 45:24.040
but on the day they went to film it
there was too much turbulence

45:24.120 --> 45:25.320
so it never happened.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.520
Simi and his art director Carlo Leva

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
had a sort of...

45:30.120 --> 45:33.120
They didn't work from storyboards,
Leone never worked from storyboards

45:33.200 --> 45:37.040
but they obviously had a vision
of how it would fit the scope screen.

45:37.120 --> 45:42.000
[Leva] He sent us to see
two or three cemeteries

45:42.080 --> 45:45.040
to understand what they looked like.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.720
And they were built...

45:47.800 --> 45:50.040
ASSISTANT ART DIRECTOR
"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY"

45:50.120 --> 45:51.960
...in a perfect geometrical manner.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.120
Rounded.

45:53.480 --> 45:59.640
Also all the tombs were circular.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.960
The director saw it.

46:10.480 --> 46:15.640
"Holy shit, Carleto,
what have you done?", said Sergio.

46:30.480 --> 46:34.440
It was Joseba's stubbornness
to build the perimeter stone wall.

46:34.520 --> 46:37.480
I didn't think it was necessary.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.800
We would have to work
very hard moving stones.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.000
Now I see it and I think, "My God!"

46:43.400 --> 46:46.320
The cemetery wouldn't be
the same without the wall.

46:46.400 --> 46:50.200
Half meter by half meter tall.
Half meter wide by half meter tall.

46:50.520 --> 46:53.320
Then there're four streets 4 meters long.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.280
-Of those 300 meters, 4 by 3, 12.
-12.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.240
Make it 15 empty meters.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.360
Plus some more empty meters.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.160
-A lot of trips.
-Yes.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.440
A dozen trips by tractor as well.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.720
-Yeah.
-OK, that's alright.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.720
Maybe... Maybe a fence.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.920
[motor revving]

47:27.640 --> 47:32.120
How many could we bring?
7, 8, 10 trailers full of stones?

47:32.440 --> 47:37.000
Each trip was half an hour coming,
and half an hour going, by tractor.

47:37.080 --> 47:41.200
[García] They came, left the stones here,
and once here, picked them up.

47:41.280 --> 47:45.360
And then try to build a perfect circle,

47:45.440 --> 47:48.240
that doesn't always look perfect.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.720
Some stones...

48:00.960 --> 48:03.240
just don't fit each other.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.280
[men speaking indistinctly]

49:20.640 --> 49:23.040
[Montero]
It's satisfactory, seeing the result.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.320
And how it'll look with all the crosses.

49:25.560 --> 49:30.120
The cemetery, let's call it Sergio
Leone's cemetery, as he built it.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.680
I am honoured.

49:31.960 --> 49:37.280
We must thank all these people
that make 50 km, 100 and go there.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.240
It's a true honour.

49:41.920 --> 49:46.000
-Maybe a flatter one? Did we bring one?
-Yes.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.480
This magic piece of film history
is then preserved.

49:49.600 --> 49:55.000
And it's probably started a bit late,
but it wasn't too late.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.560
It's gotta be
human nature you know, that...

49:59.520 --> 50:01.760
you're drawn to something for a reason.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.920
Or something has impacted
you and your life.

50:04.680 --> 50:09.760
And the journey to that place is almost
more important than getting there.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.800
Just the fact that you are on a mission
to do something.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.640
It tells you about that person.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.400
That they're searching
for something they have.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.160
After they shot the battle,
they rebuilt the bridge.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.000
It couldn't bear weight,
but was good enough for the explosion.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
-Not well rebuilt.
-Boards blew up.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.440
You can see the rocks falling.

50:32.040 --> 50:35.080
-Yes, you see them.
-Yes, it's true.

50:35.240 --> 50:39.440
You can see the stones
falling next to them.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.600
From the point of view
of the outside world,

50:41.680 --> 50:44.800
he's probably the most famous
Italian film director who's ever lived.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.720
And he's certainly the most influential.

50:46.800 --> 50:50.120
Why don't you people
take Leone more seriously?

50:50.200 --> 50:55.480
You take you know Visconti, Bertolucci,
Pasolini, Fellini, Antonioni...

50:55.560 --> 50:57.760
There's hundreds of books
written about these people.

50:57.840 --> 51:02.240
People say, "You can't take him seriously,
he didn't make movies about Italy."

51:02.840 --> 51:06.080
They can't forgive him that.
The world is changing.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.600
And you've got the rise of Tarantino,

51:08.680 --> 51:11.720
the rise of Rodriguez,
all these new filmmakers

51:11.800 --> 51:13.960
who rated Leone very very highly.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.560
All I can say is he directed
the hell out of those movies

51:16.640 --> 51:18.440
and even today

51:19.360 --> 51:24.040
there's very little, with all our CGI
and all the stuff we have at our command,

51:24.160 --> 51:26.720
there's really very little I think
to match the impact

51:27.000 --> 51:30.360
that picture had on audiences in 1966.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.600
I was reading literature
about Leone's films.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.920
People talk about Leone
being interested in details,

51:37.000 --> 51:42.400
Leone using historical documentation
to set up scenes.

51:42.600 --> 51:47.000
But as a scientist you are interested
in evidence, evidence based things.

51:47.080 --> 51:50.280
Whenever I got a high resolution
behind the scenes still

51:50.600 --> 51:53.600
from the movie, I studied it in detail

51:54.040 --> 51:58.880
and in one particular still I could see
Sergio Leone standing at Sad Hill cemetery

51:59.160 --> 52:02.400
holding something in his hand.
It could have been a book.

52:02.600 --> 52:05.400
When you looked closer
it appeared that he's using

52:05.480 --> 52:07.000
his forefinger as a bookmark.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.200
So I blew up this photo

52:09.440 --> 52:12.840
and, because I looked at hundreds
of Civil War photos in the past,

52:12.920 --> 52:17.320
I recognized that this image was part
of a famous Civil War photo.

52:17.720 --> 52:21.720
Now the next job was to find
a book which has this image on it.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.120
So I went through hundreds of books

52:24.200 --> 52:26.320
that had to be printed before 1966.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.400
And after a long long time,

52:29.480 --> 52:31.400
one day I found this book.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.680
"Gardner's Sketch Book of the War".

52:33.920 --> 52:37.040
You can't be sure which page
Leone had his finger on,

52:37.320 --> 52:40.200
but he certainly was using
Alexander Gardner's book

52:40.280 --> 52:43.360
to set up these dead soldiers
on the battlefield.

52:43.520 --> 52:48.200
For a normal person would be enough
to place the soldiers on their backs,

52:48.280 --> 52:49.840
but Leone's got the book in his hand

52:49.920 --> 52:52.280
and he wants to get it
just as in the photo.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.600
There's a famous critique
of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"

52:57.680 --> 53:00.880
written by the Italian novelist
Alberto Moravia.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.240
He said the early Italian westerns
were copy of the American westerns.

53:05.320 --> 53:08.520
All about Buffalo Bill
and Billy the Kid and things like that.

53:08.920 --> 53:12.840
And Leone's early films are struggling
to find an Italian idiom,

53:12.920 --> 53:15.920
or a Italian-Spanish idiom,
to tell those old stories.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.120
And with "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"

53:18.200 --> 53:22.040
the "Mediterraneasation"
of the western is complete.

53:22.480 --> 53:25.320
The cemeteries,
the crucifixes, the coffins,

53:25.560 --> 53:29.560
the locations, the sound design,
the music, the costumes...

53:29.640 --> 53:32.520
There's Eastwood
in a high waisted long coat

53:32.600 --> 53:35.520
and a floral shirt.
A floral shirt in the wild west?

53:35.600 --> 53:37.360
You know, looks great.

53:37.760 --> 53:41.440
All of this is very European.
And Moravia says,

53:41.520 --> 53:44.480
"Is it just about a fistful of dollars?
About making money?

53:44.560 --> 53:46.080
Or is there more going on?"

53:46.160 --> 53:47.240
Question mark.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.480
I've spent half of my professional
career persuading the world

53:50.560 --> 53:51.960
there's a great deal more going on.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.120
Leone did few films. I regret that.

53:55.480 --> 53:57.640
He was only 60.

53:57.960 --> 54:04.400
Some of the people who worked with him
in the films, met at his funeral.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.680
We couldn't believe it.

54:07.480 --> 54:13.240
But he liked living,
he liked working, he liked everything.

54:13.680 --> 54:17.120
60 years old.
Today he would be 90 years old,

54:18.160 --> 54:20.280
88 like Morricone.

54:24.040 --> 54:28.080
The day the reconstruction
works began at the cemetery,

54:28.280 --> 54:29.640
October 3, Saturday,

54:31.440 --> 54:35.240
I left Bilbao at 7:40 am.

54:36.400 --> 54:40.000
And I remember, I will not forget,
I said to my father,

54:40.880 --> 54:45.520
"Well, I am going to Sad Hill to dig.
We start today."

54:46.720 --> 54:49.640
My father was very sick,

54:50.680 --> 54:51.520
and...

54:53.080 --> 54:57.680
and I remember
I just said goodbye to him.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.360
"I'll call you on Sunday."

55:02.280 --> 55:03.560
I went to Sad Hill.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.320
OCTOBER 3, 2015

55:05.400 --> 55:08.360
I got there at 10.30 am.

55:08.760 --> 55:11.600
I worked all day.
I met very nice people.

55:12.240 --> 55:15.880
At 7 pm we finished,
and I left for Pinilla.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.240
And...

55:18.920 --> 55:22.080
I had 20 missed calls.

55:22.920 --> 55:23.720
So...

55:24.240 --> 55:27.720
The first day of the reconstruction
of Sad Hill cemetery,

55:29.080 --> 55:35.880
stars aligned again,
this time in a negative way.

55:36.920 --> 55:37.840
My father was gone.

55:39.960 --> 55:44.280
Saying goodbye to my father in Bilbao
to go dig at Sad Hill,

55:44.680 --> 55:46.800
and never seeing him again.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.800
I would have loved to tell him

55:52.560 --> 55:54.880
how I lived that moment.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.640
Making a hope come true.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.040
Making a dream come true.

56:00.800 --> 56:05.120
Well, I decided I would not sponsor
a tomb in my name,

56:06.080 --> 56:09.080
but that my tomb would be
under the name of my father.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.160
He deserves it better than me.

56:17.360 --> 56:20.800
It's a tribute to my best friend,
on top, my father.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.080
[crowd humming "The Memory Remains"]

56:34.520 --> 56:37.280
GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN
JULY 2011

57:06.040 --> 57:08.280
[people speaking indistinctly]

57:12.200 --> 57:17.560
JULY 24, 2016

57:20.160 --> 57:21.880
[Simi] I am happy to be here.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.720
I am looking to settle,

57:23.800 --> 57:27.680
to keep to myself everything
that is coming from the outside.

57:27.760 --> 57:29.280
DAUGHTER
OF ART DIRECTOR CARLO SIMI

57:29.360 --> 57:31.600
And I am truly surprised to see...

57:32.400 --> 57:34.680
all this people arriving here

57:34.760 --> 57:39.800
as if there was an UFO
about to land any minute.

57:42.040 --> 57:46.520
I imagine
what they would have thought and said.

57:46.600 --> 57:50.320
My father, Sergio, Tonino Delli Colli.

57:50.440 --> 57:53.440
Who knows if they would have imagined

57:53.520 --> 57:57.080
that today all this was going to happen.

57:58.080 --> 58:00.560
[people speaking indistinctly]

58:02.120 --> 58:05.800
Those who had seen the film
many times could perfectly locate

58:06.040 --> 58:07.480
every scene, every shot.

58:08.360 --> 58:11.720
But now everybody can easily recognize

58:12.480 --> 58:14.560
where the movie was shot.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.600
People stand where the actors stood,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.400
and can recognize
every frame and every detail.

58:25.920 --> 58:28.560
[Leigh] Film is a document of a time

58:28.640 --> 58:33.120
and to go along to the location
20, 30, 40 years later to see

58:33.200 --> 58:37.320
the impact of the passing of time
had on that location is fascinating.

58:37.800 --> 58:42.480
It's recovering
a tangible object or a place

58:42.720 --> 58:45.240
you've lived or you've dreamt.

58:45.320 --> 58:48.440
Get it back physically,
suddenly finding it.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.840
And somehow it becomes more real.

58:50.920 --> 58:53.560
That dream, that film you saw,

58:53.640 --> 58:55.960
it wasn't a dream. It did exist.

58:59.800 --> 59:02.960
[Frayling] I think in some ways
people going to visit

59:03.960 --> 59:08.560
the sets and locations of movies they love
is a kind of pilgrimage.

59:09.040 --> 59:13.040
And by actually
walking across the set

59:13.120 --> 59:15.800
you get a sense
of the excitement of the movie,

59:15.880 --> 59:18.640
but also you've touched the sacred place.

59:18.760 --> 59:21.280
[Dante] Well, you have to realise
that for some people

59:21.560 --> 59:24.480
the arts are a religion.
That is their religion.

59:25.080 --> 59:27.360
When I go to the movies
is like I go to Church.

59:27.440 --> 59:30.800
Lights go down
and you're transported somewhere.

59:30.880 --> 59:32.280
And it's very emotional.

59:32.560 --> 59:37.640
[Frayling] People want a sort
of sacred experience with a little less.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.920
And they're not getting it
from the Church,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.520
so they get it from other things.
They get it from art, from film,

59:42.600 --> 59:45.320
they get it from
pilgrimages of this kind.

59:45.800 --> 59:49.160
I did an exhibition in Los Angeles
a few years ago

59:49.240 --> 59:52.040
on Leone at the Gene Autry Museum

59:52.520 --> 59:55.680
and we were very lucky
to get as the key exhibit

59:55.760 --> 59:59.400
the actual poncho that Clint Eastwood
wore in all three films,

59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.640
there was only one.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.920
The Perspex box had
to be cleaned 8 times a day.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.440
Because everyone wanted to press
their face against this box

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.720
to get close to this...

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.240
It was like a holy relic.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.920
Like a religious aura around this...

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.320
Which is basically
a rather tatty piece of cloth

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.880
but it's the sacred piece of cloth.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.120
I understand when a fan comes up to me
and says, "Thank you".

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.880
They just say, "Thank you".

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.360
And I know instantly,
they don't have to go into explanation.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.560
There's so many stories

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.120
that art, music,
touches people's lives

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.560
so as fan when they come up and
say "thank you", I know, I get it.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.280
[boy] How does it look?

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.640
[boy 2]
I'm a little to the left but it's fine!

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.800
That's it!
Let's move on to the last shot!

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.640
[boy] Turn a little bit
more this way, this way.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.000
Just show the most
surprised look of the Ugly, OK?

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.520
No, not like that, just look at him, OK?

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:05.880
Cut.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.680
[all speaking indistinctly]

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.960
[Alba] We thought the band
should play in the circle.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.360
A band playing Morricone's themes

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.840
within the circle at the roman theater
that Leone set up there.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920
[band playing Morricone's theme]

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.200
Leone once said that people
accused him of making melodramas,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.880
that Leone supplied the "drama"
and Morricone supplied the "melo".

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.960
And you could almost do away
with dialogue altogether

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.800
which you virtually do
in the last 20 minutes

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.320
of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.680
It's almost ironic that the Spaghetti
westerns were considered

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.240
beneath the traditional
American westerns.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.040
And yet Ennio Morricone's main theme
has become synonymous with the western.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.160
[Dante] It's inconceivable to think

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.200
of those movies without Morricone.
And it's also inconceivable

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.960
to think of the Italian western genre
without Morricone.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.400
Because there are other good composers,
but they had to adopt that style.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.960
[Frayling] There's no doubt the music
was written in advance

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.960
for the last 20 minutes. And they always
wanted from the very beginning

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.880
to have a complete fusion of music
and image rather like a rock video.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.440
The main themes
were recorded in advance.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.200
"The Ecstasy of Gold"
was recorded in advance, as others.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.680
When you film a movie and you already know
the music behind it,

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.160
the actors work already
thinking of that music.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.800
[Morricone] Because he found the rhythm
listening to the music.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.800
The camera moved

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.920
according to the music.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.520
[applauses]

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.040
[Alba] One of the colleagues
has a theatrical group

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.440
and came up with the idea
of representing the duel scene

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.520
at the original location.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.640
It's a dream come true, imagine it,
as the date came closer,

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.600
we had spoken
about doing the duel sequence.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.360
It would be cool
if people came to see it.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.520
I imagined it like that,
with all the people around the cemetery.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.600
You could see the place was packed.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.560
Starts off with a Spanish guitar
held very close to the microphone

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.600
where you get this extraordinarily
loud Spanish guitar.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.440
And then from the Spanish guitar
building up to this mariachi trumpet

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.960
that is absolutely glorious.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.720
Which is like bullfight music.
[humming a tune]

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.440
I can't get it in this moment.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.920
[humming a tune]

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.600
No, actually no, I've got the wrong one.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.480
I didn't want to include the trumpet,

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.160
it was the third film
where I used it with Leone,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.200
so it troubled me a lot.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.680
But he insisted so I included it,

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.840
but very different
from the previous movies.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.520
[moaning]

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.120
Someone once said
that Leone's films are like operas

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.120
in which the arias aren't sung,
they're stared.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.560
[cheering and applauses]

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.320
[García] I've never acted
for so many people,

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.120
and I don't think I'll do it again.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.040
It lasted less than 10 minutes,
but the greatest 10 minutes of my life.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.000
[chatting indistinctly]

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.480
The great Eugenio Alabiso,
the film editor

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.160
and true connoisseur of Sergio Leone.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.080
[man] It is an honor to have these people
with us who are coming from Italy,

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.040
50 years later.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.720
[Del Valle] Someone like me,

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.360
making these people happy,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.720
people like Alabiso,
the editor of the film.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.960
The honor is mine,
of being here with you.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.400
Thank you.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.080
[cheering and applauses]

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.960
[Alba] 4,000 people excited
to share with you that day

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.040
I think we were all about to cry.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.440
[chatting indistinctly]

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.920
When we were ready,

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.000
we had to introduce

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.560
the film
and some surprise messages before.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.680
Sergio was speaking
and we were saying, "Jesus, man, shut up".

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.240
Well, OK, video in.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.880
[cheering and applauses]

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.120
I regret not seeing you,
not going to Spain, Burgos.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.360
To meet all the people who loved
Sergio's film

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.640
after 50 years.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.400
This film that still resists
the passing of time

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:09.880
and it's a glorious achievement
for Sergio, and therefore very important.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.880
[Del Valle]
Seeing Morricone speaking about

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.960
the people from Burgos
who rebuilt the cemetery.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.000
It's huge, I can't express it with words.
It's overwhelming.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.319
Hello, fans of Sergio,

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.720
Ennio and Metallica possibly,

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.200
and obviously
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.399
Celebrating the 50 years that this film

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:34.920
has been around and all the hard work

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.800
that everyone's done here
to rebuild the cemetery.

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:42.800
I've been listening
to Metallica since I was a kid,

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.000
and see him supporting
something that you have done...

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.479
I think that's astonishing.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.720
[Hetfield] I share the love
and the passion of this movie

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.439
and the music,
and how it's helped shape my life

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.160
with you guys there.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:01.319
So thank you for doing
what you are doing there

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.040
and I am there in spirit. Thank you!

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:09.240
[Alba] Hetfield was
the epitome of that day.

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:12.399
No need to think more.
We have managed

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.000
to have Morricone speaking about us,
and Hetfield sending us such a message

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.960
in front of everyone
who had come to see the film.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.439
What else can we ask
to close the 50th anniversary?

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.760
They misled us like kids, because
we knew about Morricone's message,

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.040
about Hetfield's message.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.240
What happened?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.960
Look what happened!

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.479
When we thought that was all...

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.240
Someone appears...

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:50.760
God appears.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.880
It gives me goosebumps

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.720
when I remember that moment.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.720
I thought it was just a picture because...

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.840
Honestly, I didn't understand.
I just saw Clint Eastwood,

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.680
Román was screaming,
Joseba was jumping.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.840
It's an amazing project

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.760
that I forgotten all
about it myself, but...

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.720
I remember...

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.600
being there in Northern Spain.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.960
We were both there
in the north of Spain, in Burgos,

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.720
and the vicinity Covarrubias

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.400
and then we went down in Almería.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.920
I don't understand what he says,
I only see his face.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.400
I was stunned.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.040
It's hard to realise
that he was actually addressing us.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.480
But when I saw that he started
speaking about Burgos, Covarrubias,

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.080
the cemetery.
He'd seen images of it.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.120
I think it's a great idea

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.440
unearth the cemetery.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.840
I've seen some of the pictures of the job

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.520
they did and it's quite great.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.040
He is looking at our faces.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.280
Patting our backs for what we've done.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.200
I didn't know what happened until later,

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.880
catching up
with my colleagues and, dammit,

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.960
they managed to get Clint Eastwood
here speaking about the Association.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.600
I'd like to thank everybody

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.120
and I hope you have good luck
with the cemetery,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.120
with the history of it all.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.480
It was a great experience
to be there and...

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.920
I...

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.640
I admire you
for having that kind of interest.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.880
Thank you.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
[Del Valle] Clint sent us a message.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.920
After so many years,
and so many hopes and dreams

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.240
that become real at that moment.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.840
You can see them smiling,
but Clint Eastwood smiling

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.960
and commenting the work
we have done recovering Sad Hill...

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.000
We knew Clint Eastwood
wouldn't come,

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.560
but seeing him on the screen
supporting us...

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.920
The message has arrived. The message
has arrived and we treasure it,

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.840
and it's the prize to all the effort done.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.320
It's clear that...

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400
when you fight for something

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.080
whatever it is, you get it.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.760
[boy] There was a moment...
We walked around for a few minutes.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.680
We only had time to walk around
for a couple of minutes at the end.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.000
And...

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.360
All of the sudden Devan hugs me.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.120
Hey, we did it man. Hug, hug.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.040
And it suddenly hits me...

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.280
just how much
a piece of art can mean to me.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.440
And how grateful I am
to have friends who...

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.400
will go to these places and make art
and take in art with me and...

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.240
and just how much these things
can have repercussions on my life

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.520
and affect me, and...

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.920
how it's inspired me
over the years to be...

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.520
better.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.720
Film on, this magic cannot stop now.
Film on.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.600
[Alba] I believe
that when you get older,

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.800
you don't enjoy things as much
as you did when you were a kid.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.040
We went all back to our childhood.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:01.080
That day were not adults watching a movie,
we were kids enjoying the moment.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.600
SAD HILL CEMETERY

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.840
THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY
50TH ANNIVERSARY 1966-2016

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.800
SEPTEMBER 2017

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.880
[Montero] The landscape has been
nicely preserved until now.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.080
And it should not be turned
into a theme park or...

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.960
that people stop taking care of it

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.640
and end up spoiling it.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.680
[García] We can't commercialise Sad Hill
nor become...

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.960
overcrowded because, otherwise,

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.320
we would spoil the beauty of the place.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.320
But it is a resource that was not
available until now, a cinema resource.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.560
And we must promote it.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.560
[Montero] I would be satisfied
if it doesn't become overcrowded.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.000
That it becomes
a cult place for film fans.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.680
Also for tourists
who would like to visit it

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.640
or walk around, but not overcrowded.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.600
[García]
I think it would be perfect to bring

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
another movie shooting
to the Arlanza Valley.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.960
It would be very nice.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.040
I am confident now, I have the right
to believe and be positive until the end.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.880
I think it will happen.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.600
It's funny, you know, like you...

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.040
You see it
and it is like you're looking at a myth.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.440
And you walk into it
and it feels like you're part of it,

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.160
it's real, right, it's alive.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.520
And then you walk away
a little bit from it, and you...

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.600
look at it now and it already...

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.480
already feels
like is receding back into myth.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.160
It's something else.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.760
Something you can't touch.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.280
It's a really strange piece of minimalist
music. It's four notes basically.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.880
That's it!

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.240
I understood
it was a key scene of the film,

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.000
very intense.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.160
It was a scene basically abstract,
without sound, only the music.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.000
And that it had to have a circular flavor.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.920
You start off from the piano,
you build up with a human choir

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.040
and then the soaring soprano voice
of Edda dell'Orso

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.880
repeated over and over again.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.360
Like serial music,
like minimalist music in a way.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.720
Because Tuco was running around
looking for a tomb that he couldn't find.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.880
So it was dramatic and comic
at the same time.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.760
Ennio said something to me
that I will not forget,

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.440
"It's the most
beautiful marriage that exists

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.960
between scenography,
image and music."

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.200
Whenever I hear that song

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.840
I start to get nervous,
because it has been our intro tape for...

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.760
30 plus years.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.800
[footsteps on sand]

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.600
GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN
JULY 2011

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.880
[crowd cheering]

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.160
["The Ecstasy of Gold"]

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.400
[Hetfield]
It's hair raising for us as a band.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.480
You know we do our little circle
and just talk.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.320
But as soon as the first notes...

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.080
[humming a tune]

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.520
When that starts,
the show has started.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.840
Every sense is heightened.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.080
The heart is going.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.320
My body knows what's coming.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.240
Here comes...
Here comes life, intense life.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880
I mean, yeah, it's happening.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.720
["The Ecstasy of Gold" continues]

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.800
[crowd singing along
"The Ecstasy of Gold"]

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.560
[Hetfield] Hearing the crowd
sing along the intro tape,

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440
all the nerves just go away.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.920
Everyone is here for the same,
for the same idea.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
For the same feeling.
For the same result.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.840
So when the crowd is singing,
I know it's gonna be great.

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.360
[crowd cheering]

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.600
[Hetfield] And then the storm.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.160
["Creeping Death" by Metallica]
