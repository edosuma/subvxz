01:13.407 --> 01:16.160
<i>The rapid train
is passing through track number one.</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:19.246
<i>Please stay behind the white line.</i>

01:44.688 --> 01:46.357
Good-bye.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.437
I'm so tired of those sweets from Kyoto.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.772
I know.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.317
I can't stand the cinnamon.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.319
It's so stinky.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.488
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.157
Some sweets from Kyoto?

02:36.240 --> 02:39.827
Cinnamon is so good for your health.
Probably good for colds too.

02:39.910 --> 02:40.953
Maybe later.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.208
- Just eat it later.
- Thank you.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.962
Did you witness it?

02:50.045 --> 02:52.298
- What?
- When the guy jumped.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.258
Weren't you late
because of the train accident?

02:56.051 --> 02:58.846
I haven't witnessed one yet.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.810
- May I?
- I can manage it.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.437
Never mind, never mind.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.696
Thank you.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.657
- Would you like some more?
- Could I?

03:18.741 --> 03:21.535
- Cinnamon is good for you.
- Thank you.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.711
<i>Auntie.</i>

03:31.420 --> 03:33.380
Mika-chan?

03:33.464 --> 03:35.007
<i>Did you call me earlier?</i>

03:37.259 --> 03:39.595
Your mother called.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.888
<i>Seriously?</i>

03:41.722 --> 03:43.432
<i>That bitch.</i>

03:46.727 --> 03:48.896
So, what happened?

03:48.979 --> 03:51.398
<i>There's something
I need to talk to you about.</i>

03:51.482 --> 03:55.152
<i>Why don't you come to my work for lunch?
I'll text you the address.</i>

03:56.737 --> 03:58.155
Okay. Got it.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.284
Yoshiko-san, we'll miss you here.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.745
Oh, no. Don't embarrass me!

04:05.913 --> 04:10.334
Even after my retirement, just for you
I will bring sweets sometimes.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.336
Really?

04:16.298 --> 04:17.548
Ms. Kawashima.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.969
Are you okay?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.640
Why don't you quit smoking?

04:26.350 --> 04:27.851
Sweets are better.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.558
Welcome home, Your Highness.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.184
“Your Highness.”

05:11.729 --> 05:14.732
Is Mika Ogawa working right now?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.985
Mika-san? Yes.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.906
Mika-san, someone's here to see you.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.326
Auntie!

05:28.620 --> 05:30.456
I took half a day off.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.418
Did you catch a cold? Are you okay?

05:36.378 --> 05:39.590
Please let me escort you to your seat.
This way, please.

05:42.593 --> 05:46.180
I'll add some milk for you.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.600
When you want me to stop,
please say “meow” like a little kitty.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.188
Meow.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.399
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

05:57.483 --> 06:01.445
I'll put a magic spell on it for you.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.867
Become more delicious.
Become more delicious.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.578
Meow. Meow. Smooch.

06:11.830 --> 06:12.956
Please try it.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.008
Delicious.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.472
So my mom called you?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.599
- Yeah.
- What did she say?

06:30.682 --> 06:32.559
Are you in trouble?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.561
She told me not to get involved.

06:34.645 --> 06:39.149
She wants to control everything.
No wonder that man left her.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.860
That man? You mean your father?

06:41.944 --> 06:45.989
Auntie, is it true that you
and my father were dating first?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.536
Why would you ask such a question?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.205
Auntie, why haven't you ever been married?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.790
None of your business.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.254
Anyway,
what did you want to talk about today?

07:01.463 --> 07:04.341
Auntie, I need a big favor from you.

07:05.259 --> 07:09.096
I want you
to take an English class for me.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.140
English class?

07:11.223 --> 07:14.852
I've been going to this class
for six months and it's great,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.229
but I really need money right now.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.231
So I decided to quit the class.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.317
I had to pay one year's fees in advance.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.195
I tried to get my money back,
but couldn't.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.073
They are a bunch of yakuzas.

07:28.157 --> 07:31.827
But they said I can transfer
the lessons to someone else.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.372
Right?

07:36.373 --> 07:39.084
- How much is it?
- 600,000 Yen.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.836
600,000 Yen!

07:40.919 --> 07:45.048
Auntie, I beg you, please.
I really need that money, Auntie.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.969
I'll change your diapers
when you are really, really old.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.220
Please, please, please.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.307
Since you took the day off,
why don't you just go now?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.642
Here you go. Free trial.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.395
It's literally across the street.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.182
Excuse me.

08:35.265 --> 08:39.352
I'm here for a free trial.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.895
Oh, yes.

08:40.979 --> 08:46.276
My niece, Mika Ogawa, referred me.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.781
Please fill out this form.
Just your name and phone number will do.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.705
The trial student's here.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.471
She's here for a free trial.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.520
Okay, please proceed to Room 301.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.480
Room 301?

09:25.274 --> 09:28.527
All the way in the back,
behind the curtain.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.751
Where is Room 301?

09:58.140 --> 09:59.725
Come in.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.435
Come on in. Come.

10:07.941 --> 10:13.113
I'm Mika Ogawa's aunt.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.617
I'm here for a free trial.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.411
Please, sit. Have a seat.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.372
What's your name?

10:23.165 --> 10:24.708
Your name?

10:25.876 --> 10:27.210
Kawashima Setsuko.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.882
Setsuko Kawashima.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
Setsuko. Okay.

10:38.889 --> 10:39.890
Setsuko.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.896
Relax, Setsuko. Okay? Don't be nervous.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.107
Looks like you need a hug. Hmm? Here.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.322
What can I say? I'm a hugger.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.949
All right, set this down.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.327
We're just gonna have fun, all right?
It's a fun class.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.746
Please, sit down. Sit down. Sit.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.501
It's important to relax,
because I teach American English.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.880
In American English, when you speak it,
you have to be lazy. All right?

11:11.963 --> 11:13.924
Lazy and relaxed.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.969
Now take your hands,
clasp them together and go--

11:19.137 --> 11:22.432
Yeah. Let it go.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.521
Then just...

11:32.609 --> 11:35.987
I'd like you to pick one of these, please.
Okay? Pick one. Pick.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.781
But no looking. No peeking.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.580
Lucy. Good.

11:45.664 --> 11:49.292
Lucy, I want you to pin this
onto your lapel. All right, Lucy?

11:50.043 --> 11:53.880
When you're in my class from now on,
you are known as Lucy.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.716
No more Setsuko.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.134
Lucy.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.345
Got it? Good.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.892
Hmm.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.062
Nope.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.647
Okay.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.983
I also want you to wear this. All right?

12:14.484 --> 12:18.321
This is the magic part. Okay, Lucy?
This is very important.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.949
Please. Do you trust me? Good.

12:26.830 --> 12:32.085
Okay, now we're gonna start with
something very basic, but essential.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.921
We're gonna introduce ourselves
to each other.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.967
I'll say,

12:39.050 --> 12:43.555
“Hi. My name is John.”

12:43.638 --> 12:45.474
And then you say...

12:47.559 --> 12:48.810
Hi.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.897
My name is Setsuko.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.565
No.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.486
Bye-bye, Setsuko. Hello, Lucy.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.904
Lucy.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.116
Hi. My name is Lucy.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.327
That's very good. Very good.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.287
Except it's not quite right.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.624
Because, you see,
Lucy is a very relaxed girl.

13:10.707 --> 13:15.128
So Lucy says, “Hi. My name is Lucy.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.838
How are you?”

13:16.922 --> 13:18.006
Hi.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.967
Open your mouth a little bit more.
Let out more sound. “Hi.”

13:21.051 --> 13:23.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.306
- Hi, my name...
- Hi.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.684
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.645
There we go.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.396
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.689
Hi.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.692
Hi.

13:39.694 --> 13:44.658
How are you?

14:02.509 --> 14:03.802
John.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.597
John.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.643
Hi.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.231
What's up?

14:18.233 --> 14:20.735
What's up, John?

14:26.741 --> 14:28.493
Looks good on you.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.000
Hmm.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.419
I'm sorry.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.712
Lucy.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.300
I forgot to return this.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.052
Oh, no, it's okay.
You can take that home, all right?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.389
I hope to see you next time.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.391
Take it home.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.524
Okay.
Lucy, why don't I introduce you to Tom.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.943
Tom, Lucy.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.695
Lucy, Tom.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.451
Nice to meet you.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.620
My name is Tom.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.955
Nice to meet you.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.418
My name is... Lucy.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.838
Oh, Lucy! Nice name.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.632
Mmm.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.427
You know what? Why don't you stay
and practice, yes? Practice with Tom.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.930
Yes. Stay, stay.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.640
Practice together.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.685
He suggests we practice together.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.271
Tom. English-only zone.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.481
Sorry, sorry.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.193
Okay.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.444
Good.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.030
Lucy.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.161
Ready?

15:53.244 --> 15:55.038
Now let's practice the American way.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.665
Oh, I know, I know.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.252
Hey, Lucy.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.801
Hey, Tom.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.220
What's up?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.764
What's up?

16:14.599 --> 16:17.227
Great. Okay, now hug each other. Hmm?

16:18.269 --> 16:20.188
Hug. All right?

16:20.271 --> 16:22.107
- Hug.
- Hug him, Lucy.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.069
This is how we hug. Hmm?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.197
Yeah.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.908
Hi, Lucy.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.786
Hi, John.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.960
Lucy, just hug me.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.479
Okay.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.648
You can let go now, Lucy.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.531
Good.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.992
Good.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.960
How long have you been taking this class?

17:25.295 --> 17:28.381
I just started after my wife died.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.259
So it's been four months or so.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.221
I'm sorry about your wife.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.556
It's okay.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.394
How about you, Lucy? Are you married?

17:43.646 --> 17:44.481
No.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.735
I'm dating though.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.903
Ah.

17:51.446 --> 17:55.075
What's your real name, Lucy?

17:59.287 --> 18:02.582
My name is Setsuko Kawashima.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.917
Ah. Ah.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.629
My name is Komori. Takeshi Komori.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.757
“Security Consultant.”

18:10.840 --> 18:13.843
Just started recently.
I was a detective before.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.679
Detective?

18:16.763 --> 18:20.350
<i>We have an announcement to make.</i>

18:20.433 --> 18:23.561
<i>Due to an accident near Kinshicho station,</i>

18:23.645 --> 18:27.899
<i>the Sobu line is significantly delayed.</i>

18:27.982 --> 18:29.859
- I'll be going now.
- Yes.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.502
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello? Mika-chan?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.754
<i>Oh, Auntie! How was the trial?</i>

18:52.841 --> 18:55.927
Very strange school.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.387
<i>How was John?</i>

18:59.681 --> 19:04.561
You said he's friendly.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.399
But I think he's too friendly.

19:11.442 --> 19:14.737
We just met for the first time,
but he hugged me.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.825
<i>That's his method, to open you up.</i>

19:18.908 --> 19:22.787
I even had to hug a classmate.

19:22.871 --> 19:26.791
It's a bit too much.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.460
<i>Auntie, did you decide to take the class?</i>

19:33.006 --> 19:34.424
Mmm.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.428
It's a strange class, but...

19:39.762 --> 19:41.681
I'll take the lessons.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.391
<i>Yay!</i>

19:54.944 --> 19:56.529
It's still good.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.284
Yoshiko-san.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.079
Thank you for your dedication
over all these years.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.207
Thank you.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.791
Thank you.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.715
- This is from all of us.
- Thank you.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.594
Yoshiko-san? Teddy for you!

20:20.553 --> 20:22.138
Thank you.

20:23.723 --> 20:29.062
Thank you for your 42 years
of dedication to our company.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.980
Thank you.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.818
You have been a very valuable employee
in this department.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.656
Good luck with
the next chapter of your life.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.410
We are really going to miss you.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.040
Thank you so much
for looking after me all these years.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.458
Thank you very much!

20:50.541 --> 20:54.087
I'll miss you too.

20:57.757 --> 21:02.011
We're going to Yoshiko-san's
farewell party now.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.097
Let's head out together.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.525
Wait a second.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.280
I was about to call you.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.199
The class was canceled today.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.828
John quit this morning.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.873
He said he had to go back to America.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.793
He left suddenly. Caused us trouble.

21:33.876 --> 21:37.005
Don't worry.
We'll find a replacement soon.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.966
We're very sorry.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.063
<i>This line is no longer in service.</i>

22:35.146 --> 22:40.610
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

23:00.797 --> 23:03.674
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello. it's me.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.594
<i>What?</i>

23:08.304 --> 23:10.306
Do you know if Mika changed her number?

23:12.016 --> 23:13.810
<i>What do you want from her?</i>

23:15.019 --> 23:17.480
Her phone is out of service,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.482
so I was worried.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.194
<i>She's going to America.</i>

23:23.277 --> 23:24.946
<i>I don't care anymore.</i>

23:26.322 --> 23:28.741
<i>Aren't you lucky that you don't have kids.</i>

23:32.787 --> 23:34.288

24:05.653 --> 24:12.201
<i>♪ Our sad fated love

24:12.785 --> 24:15.872
Let's sing together!

24:18.374 --> 24:19.834
Stop it, you fat pig!

24:24.672 --> 24:26.299
Do you know...

24:27.842 --> 24:31.345
what these assholes say behind your back?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.057
“Delusional.”

24:36.476 --> 24:38.227
“Attention-seeking.”

24:40.062 --> 24:42.982
“Unwanted, hysterical, single bitch.”

24:44.108 --> 24:45.818
“Useless.”

24:48.446 --> 24:49.906
They couldn't...

24:51.616 --> 24:55.286
wait for you to leave.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.796
Enjoy the next chapter of your life.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.548
Good luck.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.676
Yoshiko-san!

25:57.682 --> 25:59.308
I'm sorry!

26:05.940 --> 26:07.817
I'm sorry!

26:34.260 --> 26:36.262
Please step back. it's dangerous.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.775
Good morning.

27:15.009 --> 27:19.013
We found a new teacher.
Class is on at the usual time.

27:34.445 --> 27:35.696
Come on in.

27:40.159 --> 27:44.538
Hello. My name is Nancy. What's your name?

27:44.622 --> 27:47.958
Hi. My name is Lucy.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.170
- Lucy, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

27:51.253 --> 27:54.215
- And you are?
- My name is Tom.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.801
- Tom. Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.262
Oh, boy.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.557
I'm a hugger. What can I say?

28:04.809 --> 28:06.102
Well, have a seat.

28:09.689 --> 28:13.192
So, what did you two study with John?

28:13.275 --> 28:15.736
We studied American English.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.364
Good.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.366
Let's practice. Lucy.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.164
Hey, Lucy.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.791
Hey, Tom.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.299
Okay, that's enough hugging.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.343
Let's just get started, shall we?

28:52.022 --> 28:53.649
Did you change your perfume?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.444
Can you tell? You're good.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.160
Do you guys run this place?

29:06.579 --> 29:08.581
I want my money back.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.833
We found a new teacher.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.837
The class isn't the same.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.132
You.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.593
Would you like to take my spot?

29:20.676 --> 29:21.969
Me?

29:53.167 --> 29:54.835
Dear Auntie,

29:54.919 --> 29:58.756
<i>I'm so sorry that I didn't warn you
about my great escape.</i>

29:58.839 --> 30:01.342
<i>I'm staying with John in LA.</i>

30:01.425 --> 30:03.177
<i>I bought a car recently.</i>

30:03.260 --> 30:06.931
<i>Come visit me
and see the blue California sky.</i>

30:07.014 --> 30:08.849
<i>From Mika.</i>

30:33.249 --> 30:35.000
John.

30:37.503 --> 30:41.674
Nice to meet you.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.179
Setsuko?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.765
I know you're there.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.894
I heard the TV.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.532
Here. 600,000 Yen.

31:06.615 --> 31:07.616
What?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.703
I told you not to get involved, didn't I?

31:13.998 --> 31:16.625
I'm taking the English class,

31:16.709 --> 31:19.378
so she doesn't owe me.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.756
Mika is my daughter. I'll deal with her.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.176
You always love doing unsolicited favors.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.180
How is Mika-chan doing?

31:30.848 --> 31:32.433
I don't know.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.060
I haven't talked to her since she left.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.230
It's best to think she is dead.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.692
I've suffered enough
with her all these years.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.488
She didn't contact you or anything,
did she?

31:47.865 --> 31:50.826
I just received a postcard from her.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.787
Does it have the address?

31:53.871 --> 31:55.372
Mmm.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.374
Can I have the address?

31:58.375 --> 31:59.501
Hold on.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.232
Write it down here.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.867
Have you been doing well?

32:33.243 --> 32:35.663
Me? Yeah.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.923
How about you?

32:47.257 --> 32:50.344
Why the hell
would you ask me such a question?

33:05.484 --> 33:08.904
<i>Let's review today's key phrase.</i>

33:10.239 --> 33:11.907
<i>I'd like to check in.</i>

33:12.950 --> 33:15.077
<i>I'd like to check in.</i>

33:15.160 --> 33:17.454
<i>I'd like to check in.</i>

33:17.538 --> 33:19.915
<i>I'd like to check in.</i>

33:19.999 --> 33:21.917
<i>I'd like to check in.</i>

33:23.085 --> 33:24.753
<i>Basic English lessons--</i>

33:24.837 --> 33:29.299
Hi, John.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.347
Thank you very much. Yes, bye.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.640
Yes.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.601
Boss.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.521
Here is a vacation request.

33:48.610 --> 33:51.488
Tomorrow? That's so sudden.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.868
But perhaps that's what you need.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.705
Okay.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.512
<i>Yes?</i>

34:15.596 --> 34:17.473
It's me, Setsuko.

34:27.483 --> 34:28.525
Here.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.319
I don't need this.

34:31.445 --> 34:35.866
Like I said,
I paid for my own English lessons.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.534
I don't want to owe you anything.

34:40.788 --> 34:44.248
One more thing, Sister.
I'm going to Los Angeles.

34:45.793 --> 34:49.755
I'll tell Mika that you're worried.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.799
Why are you going to Los Angeles?

34:53.509 --> 34:56.094
I have so many unused vacation days.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.763
So just for a holiday.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.973
- Alone?
- Mmm.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.602
Then I'm coming.

35:06.105 --> 35:10.734
<i>NKL Flight 6789</i>

35:15.447 --> 35:18.117
<i>at Gate 85.</i>

35:59.533 --> 36:01.869
You bought one just for yourself?

36:02.995 --> 36:06.331
It's polite to ask
if the other person wants one too.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.169
You're so selfish.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.013
Want something to drink, Sis?

36:22.139 --> 36:23.473
No, thanks.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.534
- Here.
- No, thanks.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.164
I said no, didn't I?

37:08.101 --> 37:09.436
What are you taking?

37:12.564 --> 37:13.815
Sleeping pills.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.153
You've loved pills since you were a kid.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.866
Oh, do you want me to switch? Switch?

37:22.950 --> 37:24.493
Oh, no, no, no.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.078
She likes...

37:26.995 --> 37:29.039
Aisle.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.792
- She likes there.
- The aisle? She likes the aisle?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.086
You like the aisle?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.171
Okay.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.974
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

37:47.057 --> 37:49.476
<i>- Kanpai.</i>

37:55.065 --> 37:58.068
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Yes.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.740
So, uh, are you sisters?

38:03.824 --> 38:05.409
- Sisters?
- Right?

38:05.492 --> 38:07.703
- Yes. Yes, sisters.
- Yeah?

38:07.786 --> 38:12.165
Uh-huh. Well, you look alike. Very pretty.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.042
- Pretty?
- Very pretty.

38:14.126 --> 38:17.337
No. Thank you.

38:17.421 --> 38:19.172
She says we're pretty.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.341
Cheers.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.887
How do you say, uh...

38:26.680 --> 38:29.808
How do you say “nusumu” in English?

38:29.891 --> 38:31.310
“Nusumu”?

38:31.852 --> 38:33.937
“Nusumu” is “steal,” right?

38:35.814 --> 38:39.109
She steal boyfriend

38:39.735 --> 38:41.278
and marry.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.371
Hey, Sis. Your luggage.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.499
Thank you.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.296
Oh, no! it got scratched!

39:00.213 --> 39:02.507
I just bought it!

39:02.591 --> 39:03.592
Come on.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.803
That's why we should've ﬂown
on a Japanese airline!

39:07.596 --> 39:09.348
Sis.

39:10.599 --> 39:11.725
Wait!

39:55.519 --> 39:58.230
hip-hop playing,
man rapping in Spanish]

39:58.313 --> 39:59.606
Okay.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.027
6230.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.321
And this is your spot.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.506
Mika.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.967
It's your mother!

40:33.974 --> 40:36.476
Hello. May I help you?

40:36.560 --> 40:39.062
Mika's mother.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.859
Hi, John.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.570
Oh, my God. Lucy!

40:46.653 --> 40:47.779
Lucy?

40:48.780 --> 40:49.948
Lucy.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.242
Where is Mika?

40:53.452 --> 40:54.953
Um, Mika's not here.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.290
Not here? Where?

40:58.373 --> 41:02.419
I don't know, because she's not
answering her cell phone, so...

41:02.502 --> 41:04.212
What?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.923
No phone. Urn...

41:07.674 --> 41:10.427
She left. Gone.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.858
Mika?

41:27.486 --> 41:28.695
Mika?

41:30.864 --> 41:32.991
Go ahead and raid my room.

41:47.506 --> 41:48.507
Yeah.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.053
The Maid Café.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.182
Love at first sight.

42:08.777 --> 42:11.446
It's Mika's. She forgot it.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.784
Stupid girl.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.372
Hold on a sec.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.921
- Hi there.
- Hi, Henry.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.758
- Got visitors?
- Yeah.

42:33.093 --> 42:34.761
Japanese?

42:34.844 --> 42:36.054
Hello.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.639
Hello.

42:39.307 --> 42:42.143
It's that time of the month.
You owe me two months rent.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.395
- What?
- Probably money.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.105
- Leave if you can't pay.
- Money?

42:45.188 --> 42:47.190
Henry, I'm gonna get you your money.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.986
I'll be back in an hour.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.823
If you can't pay,
I will start the eviction process.

42:55.657 --> 42:56.950
Good-bye.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.746
Okay, Henry.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.001
Sorry about that.

43:06.668 --> 43:09.796
I never offered you anything.
We only have beer.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.006
Beer?

43:11.089 --> 43:12.757
No, thank you.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.176
No, thank you.

43:16.720 --> 43:18.722
Are you hungry?
You guys wanna eat something?

43:18.805 --> 43:20.015
I'm hungry.

43:20.682 --> 43:23.643
- Sis, how about you?
- I'm tired.

43:23.727 --> 43:26.313
Why don't you two go?

43:26.396 --> 43:29.566
She said, we go.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.447
Good?

43:47.042 --> 43:48.251
What?

43:50.587 --> 43:52.255
Mmm.

43:52.339 --> 43:53.715
Thank you.

43:55.592 --> 43:58.345
John, new teacher came.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.974
Her name is Nancy.

44:03.933 --> 44:06.895
Yeah. Is she good?

44:06.978 --> 44:08.396
No.

44:11.566 --> 44:12.942
I'm sorry.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.779
I had to follow Mika.

44:19.783 --> 44:21.993
Why you...

44:23.244 --> 44:24.579
and Mika...

44:26.247 --> 44:27.540
separated?

44:32.212 --> 44:34.297
I guess she doesn't like me anymore.

44:37.509 --> 44:38.927
You finished?

44:42.347 --> 44:43.390
John.

44:45.308 --> 44:46.518
Let's hug.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.400
Hi, Lucy.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.117
Let's go.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.705
We're home.

45:06.788 --> 45:09.124
Tacos for Ayako.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.253
You.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.046
Liar!

45:15.880 --> 45:18.299
You really raided my room, didn't you?

45:20.885 --> 45:23.722
“Hi, John. Samantha says hi

45:23.805 --> 45:27.559
from sunny San Diego. Mika.”

45:28.393 --> 45:30.353
Stupid girl.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.440
“Samantha says hi”?

45:34.816 --> 45:36.484
Who is Samantha?

45:37.444 --> 45:39.654
When this you get?

45:39.738 --> 45:41.531
Just yesterday. I swear.

45:41.614 --> 45:43.324
Yesterday? San Diego?

45:43.408 --> 45:45.201
She took our car.

45:45.285 --> 45:47.120
She took our car and--

45:47.203 --> 45:49.122
How she drive?

45:49.205 --> 45:51.166
I taught her how to drive.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.501
I taught her.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.712
She got her license here.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.422
You're such bad news.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.759
Ah, shit.

46:05.764 --> 46:08.266
- Hey, Henry.
- Yep.

46:12.312 --> 46:13.271
How much?

46:13.354 --> 46:16.524
1 -8-0-0.

46:16.608 --> 46:20.361
900 for the last month,
and 900 for this month.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.281
Your unsolicited favors again.

46:23.364 --> 46:24.783
Don't do it.

46:24.866 --> 46:28.661
I would really appreciate it
if I could borrow 1,800.

46:28.745 --> 46:31.748
Stop it. That's the money I gave you.

46:31.831 --> 46:35.001
- No, it's not. Stop it.
- Then prove it!

46:35.084 --> 46:37.462
Don't be ridiculous.

46:37.545 --> 46:40.757
No money, John! No more!

46:40.840 --> 46:43.760
I know Mika gave you money.

46:43.843 --> 46:46.513
Sis, give me back my money.

46:51.684 --> 46:53.728
You know you'll never get that back.

46:54.729 --> 46:57.315
It's good that Mika left him.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.822
I'll pay you back. I promise.

47:10.578 --> 47:11.871
Thank you.

47:16.459 --> 47:18.044
- Okay.
- John.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.089
Let's go. This hotel.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.383
How? No car.

47:23.466 --> 47:25.635
Rent a car.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.598
Ah, don't scratch it!

47:31.975 --> 47:33.852
All right.

47:55.582 --> 47:57.000
Where to, ladies?

48:01.421 --> 48:02.881
Never mind.

Sis. Water.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.762
Thank you.

48:58.519 --> 49:00.647
Do you wanna try?

49:00.730 --> 49:02.815
Mika used to love doing this.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.948
How?

49:10.031 --> 49:11.783
Just put it in the hole.

49:15.745 --> 49:17.538
And then squeeze...

49:19.457 --> 49:20.959
and hold.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.760
I love this smell.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.846
That's exactly what Mika said.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.317
I'll have the same as you.

49:48.569 --> 49:49.946
Me too.

49:55.201 --> 49:57.036
What can I get you?

49:57.120 --> 49:59.455
Three hamburgers, medium-well, please.

49:59.539 --> 50:01.833
Okay. French fries or salad?

50:01.916 --> 50:03.584
Ooh, french fries.

50:03.668 --> 50:08.172
Which one would you like,
french fries or salad?

50:09.549 --> 50:11.300
Potato fry, please.

50:11.384 --> 50:12.927
What?

50:15.138 --> 50:15.972
Fry.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.184
Potato fry.

50:21.144 --> 50:23.187
Come on, man.
What does that sound like to you?

50:23.271 --> 50:24.814
Fries or salad?

50:27.817 --> 50:29.736
Salad, please.

50:30.862 --> 50:31.863
Salad.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.406
Okay.

50:34.115 --> 50:36.617
- Okay.
- Okay. Just bring us our food.

50:37.618 --> 50:38.578
Jerk.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.125
They don't understand your English.

50:44.959 --> 50:47.045
They don't understand yours either.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.967
One day I asked Tom...

50:53.676 --> 50:55.178
I asked Tom.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.723
Why do you want to speak American English?

50:59.724 --> 51:01.976
And, uh, he said

51:02.727 --> 51:06.355
so that he can understand movies
without having to read the subtitles.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.609
We speak too much.

51:10.193 --> 51:11.819
He couldn't keep up.

51:18.242 --> 51:20.036
Who is Tom?

51:20.703 --> 51:25.166
Tom is a classmate in John's class

51:26.084 --> 51:28.169
whose real name is Komori.

51:28.753 --> 51:31.130
Why is his name Tom?

51:31.214 --> 51:33.841
John gave us American names in class.

51:36.052 --> 51:37.553
You want one too?

51:38.137 --> 51:41.057
Hmm. Jennifer?

51:41.140 --> 51:42.642
Or Angelina?

51:42.725 --> 51:44.310
Angelina?

51:46.938 --> 51:49.023
Stop teasing me.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.956
- May I help you?
- Hi. Yeah.

52:05.039 --> 52:05.957
Um...

52:07.750 --> 52:11.212
is there a girl named Mika Ogawa
staying here?

52:13.214 --> 52:15.007
I can't give you that information.

52:16.968 --> 52:18.511
Listen, man.

52:19.762 --> 52:23.850
These ladies came all the way from Japan
looking for her daughter.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.269
And she's very worried.

52:27.979 --> 52:30.064
You got a passport or something?

52:30.773 --> 52:31.899
Passport.

52:31.983 --> 52:33.484
Yes.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.621
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's here.

52:47.248 --> 52:50.001
She's here. What room is she in?

52:50.793 --> 52:52.461
I cannot tell you that.

52:53.171 --> 52:57.800
We... stay... here... tonight.

52:58.718 --> 53:00.469
Okay.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.263
One or two rooms?

53:03.181 --> 53:04.891
Two rooms.

53:04.974 --> 53:06.309
Two rooms, of course!

53:36.631 --> 53:37.757
Look.

53:41.052 --> 53:42.261
The same.

53:48.893 --> 53:52.355
This is the so-called “American motel.”

53:58.736 --> 54:00.446
What is that?

54:15.086 --> 54:16.587
Oh, dear.

54:18.297 --> 54:19.799
They are going at it.

54:24.303 --> 54:26.389
Americans are loud, aren't they?

54:29.934 --> 54:31.811
Like animals.

A university.
I used to teach here. Switch.

58:45.022 --> 58:48.275

59:01.747 --> 59:04.500
Hold the left

59:04.583 --> 59:07.586
and ease off.

59:09.838 --> 59:10.965
Start again.

59:12.299 --> 59:13.425
Okay.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.972

I hope that's what that says.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.653
Did it hurt?

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:16.989
A little bit.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:29.960

Oh, my God. You smell so good.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.171
It smells like Mika's hair, right?

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.905
Please don't tell Mika about this.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.910
Don't worry.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.270
Good night, Lucy. See you in the morning.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:19.338
There it is.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.299
Looks good, right?

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.468
- Color?
- Color?

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:25.969
Mm-hmm.

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.554
- Black.
- Black?

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.973
Okay, cool. I got you.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.179
Lucy?

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.980
Whoa. No, no.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.189
No, no, no.

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:41.336
I can't.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.374
Where the hell have you been?

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.340
I knocked on John's door,
but he didn't answer.

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:29.885
I was so worried.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:35.432
I ran out of cigarettes,
so John and I just went to buy some.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.268
You could've left a note or something.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:41.563
You're so selfish.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.484
That's why you never got married.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.656
What I do is none of your business.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.117
Stop trying to control me.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.495
Hey!

01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.497
Where the hell are you going?

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.458
- What are you doing?
- It's dangerous out there.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.542
Cut it out!

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.671
- Stop walking around alone!
- What the hell are you doing?

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:06.964
Stop it!

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:08.840
Hey, what the hell?

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:10.759
Let me go!

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.222
I'm going to get another room!

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.183
Why are you like this?

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.157
Housekeeping.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.828
Sorry.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.676
So, where's your sister?

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.430
I don't know.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:03.478
Not... same room.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.448
You know...

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:17.242
Mika...

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:21.913
is... pregnant?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.209
Yes.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.299
You want to...

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.011
marry Mika?

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.811
Mika...

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.317
The baby?

01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:53.612
She decided...

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.697
Baby?

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:04.289
Baby... gone?

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:10.629
Good.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:15.300
I told her to do that too.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.680
She's been a little unstable lately.

01:08:37.823 --> 01:08:39.157
Excuse me.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.827
Excuse me.

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.955
You saw my sister?

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:47.666
Japanese woman.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.792
Yeah, she took off with the guy.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.170
Your friend.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.089
Friend?

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.138
You...

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.017
hooked up with Setsuko, didn't you?

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.022
You...

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:15.694
sex with Setsuko.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:20.532
No. No, no, no.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.951
Where is Mika?

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.372
I know you know!

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.110
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Dad.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:58.820
Give me a hug.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.532
- Nice haircut.
- Thank you.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.871
Hey, Kei.
Um, we're looking for a student of mine.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.709
The girl from Japan? Yeah, she came here.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.086
She said you invited her.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.756
This is her mother, Ayako.
We need to find her.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.593
Sam, have you seen Mika?

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:22.969
- She...
- No.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.597
Don't come back unless you have the money.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.890
Come on.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:46.993
Auntie?

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.705
Auntie?

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:54.209
Auntie!

01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:56.336
No way.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.588
Auntie!

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.508
What are you doing here?

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:03.593
What am I doing here?

01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:05.178
Did you come here alone?

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.805
Your mother is here too.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.848
Seriously? Here?

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:10.850
And John.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:15.897
Your postcard to John
had the motel's address.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:18.525
So...

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:21.528
did you break up with John?

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:29.869
He has a wife and a daughter.

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.664
Can you believe it?

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:33.832
A daughter?

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.168
He's a scumbag.

01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:49.055
Be careful.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:04.195
- Hey, Mika-chan.
- Yeah?

01:12:04.279 --> 01:12:05.989
Could we rest a little?

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.241
We're almost there. Come on.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.289
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:16.541
I'm okay.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.132
Ah. Let's picnic here.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:28.887
Thank you.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.351
Cheers!

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.148
Mmm.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:42.734
It's so hot.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:57.457
It's horrible, isn't it?

01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:02.587
John and I got this in LA,
but I want to remove it.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.768
Who is Samantha?

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.063
She's John's daughter.

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.732
Samantha.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.236
Actually,

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.947
I went to see his family.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:33.034
I found their address
on John's driver's license.

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:35.870
I was going to tell them about us.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.292
Well, but... I couldn't.

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:51.428
What the hell am I doing?

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:01.354
Auntie, why don't we disappear together?

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.649
Why don't we go down to Mexico.
It's so close by!

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:08.820
See? We could start a new life together.

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:11.406
How about that?

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.533
Oh, but you wouldn't.
You don't like adventure.

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.578
I came all the way here, didn't I?

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.416
That's true.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.464
Love conquers all.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.926
You came to see John.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:34.512
What are you talking about?

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:40.852
John was telling me

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:44.564
that you hug him so tightly.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:50.778
He was probably kidding.
He was just trying to make me jealous.

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:54.240
But why would I be jealous of my aunt?

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.339
What's that?

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.924
Sorry. Nothing.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.092
What?

01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:16.804
Creep. What's so funny?

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.058
Would you believe me...

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:25.104
if I told you that I slept with John?

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.244
We have the same one.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:54.384
You bitch!

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:00.640
You think I am stupid?

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.725
You and Sis are always laughing at me!

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:03.935
Shut up!

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:05.979
All men are the same.

01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:09.315
Just like your father!

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:28.084
Mika-chan.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:33.881
No!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.759
Mika-chan!

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:58.656
Thank you.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.921
Mika-chan?

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:20.178
Mika-chan?

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:26.934
Get out.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.064
Mika.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.067
Get out.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.070
Out.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:40.031
You too.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.784
Out.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.219
John.

01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:04.180
John!

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:09.352
John. Open. Open!

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.715
Did you tell Mika about us?

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:40.967
John.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.303
I love you.

01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:47.849
John.

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:50.059
I love you.

01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:54.605
We can go together.
We can go Mexico. I have money.

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:55.940
- You're crazy!
- I have money!

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:57.692
- Listen to me. You're crazy!
- I love you!

01:18:57.775 --> 01:18:58.901
- You're crazy!
- I love you!

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:01.654
I don't love you! I don't love you.

01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:12.999
Come on.

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:18.129
I'm sorry, Lucy.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.011
John.

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:30.391
Don't go! Don't go!

01:20:27.782 --> 01:20:30.868
Stay out of our lives from now on.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:36.582
It's for the best.

01:20:42.547 --> 01:20:44.632
You got your John.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:11.075
Good morning.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:20.376
Good morning.

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.463
Good morning.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:28.050
Right. Perfect.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:37.143
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.313
Welcome back.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.775
Could I talk to you for a second?

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:05.630
- Boss, this is a souvenir.
- Oh, thank you.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.471
You just returned,
so I feel awkward having to tell you this.

01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:15.890
It's an order from the top.

01:22:16.724 --> 01:22:21.062
You're transferring to
the General Affairs Department next month.

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:24.565
The General Affairs Department?

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:26.484
It is what it is.

01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:46.253
Ms. Kawashima.

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:47.838
Are you okay?

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.553
I understand.

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:57.723
I'll resign.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:03.980
Thank you very much
for taking care of me for all these years.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.235
You win.

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.449
I'll send you my resignation letter
by mail.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.412
Excuse me.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.341
I'll pick up my belongings later.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:16.761
Don't bother.

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:18.846
We'll ship everything to you.

01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.355
Setsuko-san.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:58.070
Setsuko-san. It's Komori.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.333
Setsuko-san.

01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:14.336
It's Tom.

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:20.050
I thought you might be back by now,

01:26:20.634 --> 01:26:22.595
so I called you at work today.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.348
They told me you resigned.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:36.275
I'm not in a condition to see you.

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:42.364
How did you find out where I live?

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:48.245
A postcard signed by Lucy
arrived from San Diego.

01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:51.457
You wrote your return address as here.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.335
Please open the door.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.432
Setsuko-san.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:11.644
Setsuko-san. What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:13.229
I'm sorry.

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:16.941
I may have taken too many pills.

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:18.901
Pills?

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:21.070
Did you say pills?

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.988
I feel sick.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.410
Setsuko-san.

01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:31.622
Where is the bathroom? Setsuko-san!

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:33.666
Over there.

01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:43.592
Setsuko-san.

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:46.220
Drink water.

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.598
Vomit up all the pills, okay?

01:27:51.267 --> 01:27:53.227
Here.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.312
Open your mouth!

01:27:55.396 --> 01:27:56.730
More! More!

01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:58.107
Drink more.

01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.775
Drink.

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.069
Here. Are you okay?

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:04.071
Here! Drink more!

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.658
Good.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.621
There, there... good.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:28.345
Where are your clothes?

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.525
Is this okay?

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:44.028
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Here.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:53.454
Setsuko-san, Setsuko-san.

01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:59.752
There, there...
You're not yourself right now.

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:06.175
Okay, okay.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.469
Please hold me.

01:29:17.144 --> 01:29:18.896
Oh, Setsuko-san.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.648
What happened?

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.864
I just removed a birthmark.

01:30:10.781 --> 01:30:12.282
Years ago...

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:17.162
I lost my son.

01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:20.624
He committed suicide.

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:26.046
It's my fault.

01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:30.467
I was very strict with him.

01:30:39.977 --> 01:30:42.104
Tom and I are...

01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.815
complete opposites.

01:30:57.494 --> 01:31:00.038
Let's hug, Setsuko-san.

01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:40.537
<i>♪ Caught in the riptide ♪</i>

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:49.296
<i>♪ I was searching for the truth ♪</i>

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:56.303
<i>♪ There was a reason ♪</i>

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:02.768
