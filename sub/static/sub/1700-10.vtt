WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:11.427
Guys? There's, uh, somebody
I'd like you to meet.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.639
Wait, wait. What is that?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.516
That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.018
No. No, I don't.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.311
Oh, he is precious.
Where did you get him?

00:21.479 --> 00:23.605
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.315
That is so cruel.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.652
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.699
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross
on his ass.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.957
Ross, is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

00:42.167 --> 00:45.335
Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so...

00:45.503 --> 00:47.337
Why don't you just get a roommate?

00:47.505 --> 00:49.548
Ah, I don't know.
You reach a certain age...

00:49.716 --> 00:51.842
...having a roommate
is just kind of pathe...

00:54.429 --> 00:58.932
Uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is Sanskrit
for "really cool way to live."

01:50.944 --> 01:52.736
You guys,
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.364
I have 12 new songs
about my mother's suicide...

01:55.532 --> 01:57.783
...and one about a snowman.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.037
Might want to open with the snowman.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.415
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.626
- Hey, Joe.
- So how'd it go?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.378
Ah, I didn't get the job.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.299
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.555
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.558
He's not even jolly. It's all political.

02:23.852 --> 02:24.977
So, what are you gonna be?

02:25.186 --> 02:27.146
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.315
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

02:30.608 --> 02:32.568
Do you guys know what you're doing
for New Year's?

02:35.029 --> 02:37.823
Gee, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.575
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.286
You don't have to face
the horrible pressures of this holiday...

02:42.453 --> 02:44.496
...desperate scramble
to find anything with lips...

02:44.664 --> 02:48.375
...just so can have somebody to kiss
when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud.

02:50.044 --> 02:53.755
Well, for your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.966
So I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.177
Yeah, you wish.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.098
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick Clark holiday.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.684
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.853
Just the six of us. Dinner.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.897
- Sure.
- Fine.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.441
You know, I was hoping
for a little more enthusiasm.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.817
- Woo!
- Okay.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.779
- Phoebe, you're on.
- Oh. Oh, good.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.783
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand...

03:21.951 --> 03:24.119
...Miss Phoebe Buffay.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.791
Thanks. Hi.

03:29.959 --> 03:34.588
Um, ahem, I want to start with a song
that means a lot to me this time of year.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.096
I made a man with eyes of coal

03:43.264 --> 03:46.892
And a smile so bewitchin'

03:47.060 --> 03:49.937
How was I supposed to know

03:50.104 --> 03:52.856
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.154
La-la-la

04:00.031 --> 04:02.741
My mother's ashes

04:02.909 --> 04:06.161
Even her eyelashes

04:06.329 --> 04:13.335
Are resting in a little yellow jar

04:14.754 --> 04:17.505
- And sometimes when it's freezing
DAVID: I'm being honest here.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.673
You don't agree.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.051
- I feel a little sneezy
MAX: You're right.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.679
And now I...
Excuse me? Excuse me?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.597
Yeah, noisy boys.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.269
Is it something that you'd like
to share with the group?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.856
No. No, that's okay.

04:35.024 --> 04:38.110
Come on, if it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing...

04:38.278 --> 04:41.280
...then I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.949
That guy's going home with a note.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.957
- Nothing. I was just saying...
- Could you speak up?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.333
Sorry.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.213
I was just saying to my friend, you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.383
- And you said Daryl Hannah...
- Darryl Hannah.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.636
...was the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever seen in his life.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.056
And I said, yeah, I liked her in Splash,
but not so much in Wall Street.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.018
- I thought she had a hard quality.
- A hard quality.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.731
And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way...

05:15.898 --> 05:19.401
...you are, uh, luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.240
Then that's when you started yelling.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.459
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.341
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.389
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.854
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.814
I mean, God, by my sixth date
with Paolo...

05:57.982 --> 06:00.942
...I mean, he had already named
both my breasts.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.157
Ooh, did I just share too much?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.951
Just a smidge.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.206
David's, like, you know, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.209
- I think it's romantic.
- Me too. Oh!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.419
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

06:19.587 --> 06:20.629
Yeah.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.299
Well, he's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.969
Except...

06:29.138 --> 06:33.141
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.395
I just... I just want to be with him
all the time.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.273
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.026
And special occasions.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.490
Wait a minute. I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.951
You're gonna break the pact.
She's gonna break the pact.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.120
No, no, no.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.206
Yeah, could I just?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.669
- Yeah, because I already asked Janice.
- You what?

07:00.837 --> 07:03.463
Come on, this was a pact.
This was your pact.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.299
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle
the pressure and I snapped.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.553
Yeah, but Janice?
That was, like, the worst breakup in history.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.264
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I'm saying I snapped.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.352
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.071
Too many jokes.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.574
Must mock Joey.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.245
Nice shoes, huh?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.873
Aah, you're killing me.

07:40.084 --> 07:42.794
Ross.
He's playing with my spatulas again.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.797
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.966
Do you always have to bring him here?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.428
Look, I didn't want to leave him alone,
all right?

07:51.596 --> 07:54.139
We had our first fight this morning.

07:55.850 --> 08:00.896
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.192
He threw some feces.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.281
You know, if you're gonna work late,
I can look in on him for you.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.450
Oh, that would be great. Okay.

08:13.618 --> 08:17.078
But if you do, make sure it seems
like you're there to see him, okay?

08:17.246 --> 08:19.789
And you're not, like, doing it
as a favor to me.

08:19.957 --> 08:23.001
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.135
But you can't actually test this theory.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.764
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough...

08:35.932 --> 08:38.850
...to simulate these conditions.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.645
- Okay. All right. I have a question then.
- Yeah.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.813
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

08:46.776 --> 08:50.070
Uh, that's definitely a valid question...

08:50.238 --> 08:52.447
...and, uh, the answer...

08:52.615 --> 08:54.908
...would be yes.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.660
Yes, I was.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.167
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss...

09:04.335 --> 09:07.295
...that happened at this phenomenal
moment because, well, it's you.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.713
Sure. Yeah.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.926
Right. But, see, the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.511
And now, we've reached a place...

09:14.679 --> 09:17.264
...where it's just got to be
one of those things where I...

09:17.431 --> 09:20.308
...sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.520
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.857
Oh, David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.

09:28.025 --> 09:32.279
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.031
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.951
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me. Heh.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.540
- Now? Now?
- Right now. Just...

09:43.708 --> 09:44.916
Okay. Okay, okay.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.381
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.010
Okay. And I'll tell you, this was a gift.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.097
- So now you're just kind of tidying up.
- Okay, what the hell? What the hell?

10:03.102 --> 10:06.021
- You want me to actually throw you...?
- I can hop.

10:22.413 --> 10:26.249
Now, tell me something, what does
the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?

10:26.417 --> 10:27.542
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

10:27.710 --> 10:30.295
It's just that Chandler has somebody
and Phoebe has somebody.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.672
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.966
- Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend, Fun Bobby?
- Yeah.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.844
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

10:38.095 --> 10:39.846
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.683
Okay. Here we go.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no room for milk.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.860
There. Now there is.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.154
Okay, so on our no-date evening...

10:56.322 --> 10:58.490
...three of you now
are gonna have dates.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.824
- Uh, four.
- Four.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.618
- Five.
- Five.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.788
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.708
Yeah, and I met this really hot
single mom at the store. Ha, ha.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.211
What's an elf to do?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.589
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one
standing there alone...

11:14.757 --> 11:15.840
...when the ball drops?

11:16.008 --> 11:19.928
Oh, come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.180
Hey, you know,
this is so not what I needed now.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.016
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's Marcel.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.646
He keeps shutting me out, you know?

11:29.814 --> 11:33.441
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.112
That's so weird. I had such a blast
with him the other night.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.406
- Really?
- Yeah, we played. We watched TV.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.117
That juggling thing is amazing.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.077
What, uh?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.122
What juggling thing?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.792
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

11:51.585 --> 11:52.877
No.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.798
You know, it wasn't that big a deal.
I mean, just balled-up socks.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.007
And a melon.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.639
- Phoebe. Hi.
- Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.683
No. Have you seen David?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.519
No, he hasn't been around.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.273
Well, if you see him, tell him
to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.609
- Minsk?
- Minsk. It's in Russia.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.696
I know where Minsk is.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.323
Ha, ha. We got the grant.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.535
Three years, all expenses paid.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.328
So when do you leave?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.205
January 1 st.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.509
Hello?

12:41.927 --> 12:44.846
- Hey. Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.183
- What are you doing here?
- Um, well, Max told me about Minsk.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.311
So you know, congratulations.
This is so exciting!

12:51.479 --> 12:53.188
Yeah.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.523
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.194
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

12:59.779 --> 13:00.862
Tell her, David.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.199
"I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

13:04.366 --> 13:09.078
No, no, no. I want to stay here
and make out with my girlfriend."

13:09.246 --> 13:12.040
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.168
So you're really not going?

13:15.336 --> 13:18.588
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just...

13:19.423 --> 13:20.673
You decide.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.008
- Oh, don't do that.
- Please?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.260
No, but I'm asking you.
I can't make a decision.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.096
- I can't. Please, just...
- Okay. Stay.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.809
- Stay.
- Stay.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.027
Getting so good at that.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.322
It was Max's stuff.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.208
I love this artichoke thing.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.962
Oh, don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.385
You remember Janice.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.096
Vividly.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.605
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.650
Sandy, hi. Come on in. Hey.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.993
Ha, ha.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.037
- You brought your kids.
- Yeah. That's okay, right?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.917
Party.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.837
That thing is not coming in here.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.507
"That thing"? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.302
Let me ask you something.
If I showed up with my new girlfriend...

14:47.469 --> 14:48.970
...she wouldn't be welcome?

14:49.138 --> 14:52.098
I'm thinking your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.853
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

14:57.021 --> 15:02.650
Okay? And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here...

15:03.027 --> 15:04.527
...like nothing happened...

15:05.487 --> 15:08.740
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.367
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.537
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

15:15.164 --> 15:19.500
All right, I'll, uh, catch up with you later.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.884
Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey...

15:28.052 --> 15:31.179
...are you okay? Where's Paolo?

15:31.805 --> 15:34.974
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.976
And then your face exploded?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.898
No. Okay.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.776
I was at the airport getting into a cab...

15:44.944 --> 15:46.653
...when this woman...

15:46.820 --> 15:49.405
...this blond planet with a pocketbook...

15:50.240 --> 15:51.616
...starts yelling at me.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.494
Something about how
it was her cab first.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.748
And the next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.751
And I started blowing
my attack whistle thingy...

16:01.919 --> 16:04.921
...and then three more cabs show up.

16:05.089 --> 16:09.550
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me.

16:09.718 --> 16:15.264
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

16:17.393 --> 16:21.104
Oh! Everybody having fun at the party?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.482
Are people eating my dip?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.828
You know, when I saw you
at the store last week...

16:37.496 --> 16:41.874
...it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.129
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.256
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.261
Hey, kids.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.641
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me...

16:58.809 --> 17:01.019
...but at least check in.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.021
There you are.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.276
You got away from me.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.569
But you found me.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.530
Here, Ross, take our picture.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.282
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.203
Kill me. Kill me now. Ha, ha.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.541
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

17:24.710 --> 17:26.252
Fun Bobby!

17:26.420 --> 17:27.502
Hey, Bobby.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.257
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my, uh, grandfather...

17:31.425 --> 17:33.217
...died about two hours ago.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.597
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so...

17:37.931 --> 17:39.223
...here I am.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.976
Hey, Fun Bobby. How's it going, man?

17:42.686 --> 17:43.936
Whoa. Who died?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.569
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

17:51.737 --> 17:56.574
So at least I'll get to see him again.

17:59.244 --> 18:03.998
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write "Reunited" in glitter.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.375
All right, Janice, that's it!

18:06.543 --> 18:09.128
Janice? Janice? Ahem.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.880
Hey, Janice?

18:11.048 --> 18:14.217
When I invited you to this party,
I didn't think it meant that we...

18:14.384 --> 18:20.264
Oh, no.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.059
- I'm sorry you misunderstood.
- Oh, my God.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.853
You listen to me, Chandler.
You listen to me.

18:26.021 --> 18:30.608
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.779
Oh, will you give me the thing?

18:38.200 --> 18:41.244
- Hi, Max.
- Yoko.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.918
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.379
Wow.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.339
It won't be the same...

18:53.507 --> 18:55.466
...but it will still be Minsk.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.343
Happy New Year.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.596
Are you all right?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.526
You're going to Minsk.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.945
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.864
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

19:18.031 --> 19:21.075
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just because of me.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.829
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.082
- And I can't break up with you.
- Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.670
Just say, uh, "Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.630
And that's what I have to do right now."

19:34.798 --> 19:37.717
And I say, "Your work? Your work?
How can you say that?"

19:39.720 --> 19:42.013
And then you say, um,
"It's tearing me apart...

19:42.181 --> 19:44.932
...but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"

19:45.100 --> 19:49.061
And I say, "No.
No. I can't understand that."

19:49.229 --> 19:51.731
- Uh, ow.
- Sorry. Um...

19:52.691 --> 19:55.484
And then you put
your arms around me...

19:55.652 --> 19:59.071
- And then you put your arms around me.
- Oh, oh. Sorry.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.659
And, um... And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.996
I'll never forget you.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.375
And then you say that it's almost midnight
and you have to go...

20:11.543 --> 20:16.047
...because you don't want to start
the new year with me if you can't finish it.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.222
I'm gonna miss you...

20:24.389 --> 20:26.265
...you scientist guy.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.478
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

20:30.646 --> 20:35.608
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.526
It gets bigger and better every year.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.528
Here you go, kids.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.491
And then the peacock bit me. Ha, ha.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.534
Please kiss me at midnight.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.751
- You seen Sandy?
- Ooh. I don't know how to tell you this...

20:53.919 --> 20:58.631
...but, uh, she's in Monica's bedroom
getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.467
Oh, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.804
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.472
What?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.891
The ball is dropping.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.896
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.066
And the moment of joy is upon us.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.486
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.281
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.825
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.456
One. Happy New Year!

21:33.792 --> 21:36.836
You know, I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz...

21:37.004 --> 21:41.674
...but I do believe there are three girls
and three guys right here.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.053
Oh, I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.389
I can't kiss anyone.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.349
So I'm kissing everyone?

21:51.101 --> 21:53.269
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.064
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.607
All right. Somebody kiss me.

21:58.775 --> 22:02.611
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.864
All right. All right. All right.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.324
There.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.375
I wanted this to work so much.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.502
I'm still in there, you know?

22:18.670 --> 22:21.922
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.009
But he's just phoning it in.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.763
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much...

22:28.930 --> 22:31.307
...doesn't love you back, you know?

22:31.892 --> 22:34.810
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
