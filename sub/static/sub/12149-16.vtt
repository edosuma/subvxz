WEBVTT

00:04.929 --> 00:08.580
"Demons, Demons, Demons." They put
a lot of thought into that title.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.570
What would you call it?

00:10.929 --> 00:13.419
I don't know,
how about "Demon Database"?

00:15.130 --> 00:17.059
A name rife with single entendre.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.519
Why isn't Wolfram and Hart here?

00:21.129 --> 00:23.410
- They're lawyers, not demons.
- Fine line.

00:24.129 --> 00:25.670
They have a lot of entries.

00:25.929 --> 00:28.839
Did you know there's 12
species indigenous to L.A. County?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.350
Do they have the Vigories of Oden Tal?

00:32.530 --> 00:33.579
Nope.

00:34.329 --> 00:37.700
There's still a place in this world
for traditional research.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.899
Some ugly critters in here.

00:40.329 --> 00:43.030
Someone ought to create
an intrademon dating base.

00:43.329 --> 00:46.840
Like "Archfiend.org, where
the lonely and the slimy connect."

00:49.329 --> 00:52.560
I was just joking, grouchy.
When did you last have a dating base?

00:53.530 --> 00:56.509
For your information, I lead a rich
and varied social life.

00:57.130 --> 00:59.479
Every night it's Jeopardy!
then Wheel of Fortune...

01:00.130 --> 01:03.500
...and a cup of hot cocoa. Look out,
girls, this one can't be tamed.

01:04.328 --> 01:08.019
It may not be as intoxicating
as a life erected on a push-up bra.

01:08.530 --> 01:11.549
Hey, if anyone's wearing
a push-up bra around here it's....

01:12.730 --> 01:14.379
- Angel.
- Do you need a counselor?

01:14.530 --> 01:17.620
No, I'm way too "single entendre"
to benefit from therapy.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.829
- Don't take it personally.
- That's rich...

01:21.129 --> 01:24.290
...coming from Mr. Don't Talk to Me
Before I've Had My Oat Bran.

01:25.329 --> 01:26.409
Children, we have company.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.780
- Is one of you Angel?
- I'm Angel.

01:29.530 --> 01:32.340
I'm Darin MacNamara.
I checked around.

01:33.129 --> 01:35.549
You have a reputation
for handling unusual problems.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.640
A richly deserved reputation.

01:40.329 --> 01:41.200
You all right?

01:41.530 --> 01:43.180
I think I'm gonna pass out.

01:45.129 --> 01:48.540
I'm sorry. It's just--
My brother Jack....

01:51.129 --> 01:52.670
He was kidnapped last night.

01:55.329 --> 01:57.260
I found this in my mailbox today.

02:03.730 --> 02:05.170
Do you know who did this?

02:05.530 --> 02:08.788
Well, that's why I came to you.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.060
They weren't people.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.849 --> 03:04.460
I'm a few years older than Jack.

03:05.250 --> 03:08.939
My brother and I haven't exactly
been close since we grew up.

03:09.449 --> 03:12.400
I made something of my life,
and Jack didn't.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.280
Thanks.

03:14.849 --> 03:17.270
I don't know what they want.
There was just--

03:17.849 --> 03:19.460
You were there when he was taken.

03:19.650 --> 03:22.069
Jack called me last night,
asked me to come over.

03:25.050 --> 03:28.379
He has a gambling problem, said he was
in over his head with a bookie.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.860
- Which one?
- Ernie Nellins.

03:31.050 --> 03:34.419
He works at a sports bar
in Silver Lake called Shots.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.199
I've paid him before.
I told Jack this time to go to hell.

03:38.849 --> 03:41.759
I wanted him to suffer
the consequences of his actions.

03:43.050 --> 03:46.069
- I didn't know this would happen.
- It's not your fault.

03:46.650 --> 03:49.979
I felt guilty so I went over there,
and there were these....

03:51.449 --> 03:55.490
I don't know, creatures. Dragging
him away. I tried to stop them.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.180
- You haven't heard from anyone?
- No.

03:58.650 --> 04:01.909
I'll pay anything to get him back.
He's my little brother.

04:04.050 --> 04:06.719
Look, my Colleagues
will start looking...

04:07.050 --> 04:09.330
...into whatever kidnapped
your brother.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.860
In the meantime, write down
everything you saw.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.350
Okay. Thank you.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.550
- What about the bookie?
- I thought we'd have a little chat.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.089
This is wheat grass.
I ordered the Kiwi Cooler.

04:29.850 --> 04:30.829
Give me that.

04:31.050 --> 04:34.279
How do you drink that swill?
Give me two.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.449
Mind if I play, Ernie?

04:36.449 --> 04:38.730
- Game's invitation only, pal.
- Then invite me.

04:39.449 --> 04:42.750
It's been a while, so I might be
a bit rusty on the rules.

04:43.649 --> 04:46.600
But I think my jacks beat your pair.

04:47.850 --> 04:51.040
No, I'm not looking for a fight.
Just for him.

05:03.449 --> 05:06.329
You should try wheat grass.
It's good for digestion.

05:07.649 --> 05:09.089
- Who are you?
- A friend of Jack's.

05:10.050 --> 05:13.170
Jack doesn't have any friends.
Just people he doesn't owe.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.769
His brother will pay his debts.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.939
Out of my hands. It's not
about the money anymore.

05:21.449 --> 05:23.730
- It's about making Jack an example.
- Piece by piece?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.620
- Makes an impression on newcomers.
- Where is he?

05:27.449 --> 05:30.540
- They didn't say and I didn't ask.
- It doesn't mean you don't know.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.410
There's a place...

05:49.490 --> 05:50.790
...in Beachwood Canyon,

05:53.689 --> 05:56.009
WelI, not exactly in Beachwood Canyon,

05:57.290 --> 05:58.759
Under it, actually,

06:03.889 --> 06:04.939
Okay, I'm in,

06:05.089 --> 06:07.579
What did Darin write about
the demons that took Jack?

06:08.689 --> 06:11.740
Bald, ultrawhite skin, slime.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.389
There's always slime.
It's why I don't gamble.

06:15.889 --> 06:17.689
You make a small wager one day...

06:17.689 --> 06:20.529
...and then Beetlejuice-y
albino comes a-knocking.

06:21.889 --> 06:24.910
- Claws or hands?
- He wrote "clawlike hands."

06:25.490 --> 06:28.509
- Could be a mixed breed. Smell?
- Sulfuric.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.360
Add a Porsche and hair plugs
and I've dated this guy.

06:32.689 --> 06:33.560
A lot.

06:33.889 --> 06:37.750
- Other distinguishing characteristics?
- An eerie, high-pitched wail.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.009
Probably when it's preparing
to fight or mate.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.389
First I say "yuck"
and then I hit search.

06:45.889 --> 06:50.029
By the time you get done entering
all this into your fancy database...

06:50.689 --> 06:52.480
- ...I could've located it--
- Got it.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.660
"A Howler Demon."

06:59.089 --> 06:59.959
Yikes,

07:51.290 --> 07:53.110
- Where's Jack MacNamara?
- Not here.

07:53.689 --> 07:56.110
- Where is he?!
- We sold him.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.550
Who did we sell him to?

08:17.290 --> 08:18.300
Okay, go ahead.

08:19.089 --> 08:20.699
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:21.490 --> 08:23.490
Next, please. Tickets.

08:46.690 --> 08:47.629
You're quick.

08:50.889 --> 08:53.309
- Thank you.
- No problem.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.480
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:26.289 --> 09:28.779
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:29.289 --> 09:31.039
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:31.690 --> 09:33.580
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:34.090 --> 09:36.159
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:36.490 --> 09:38.169
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:38.889 --> 09:40.679
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:41.289 --> 09:43.149
Killing blow! Killing blow!

09:52.090 --> 09:53.700
The winner, Tom Cribb.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.860
Time: six minutes, 22 seconds.

09:56.289 --> 10:00.470
If you're keeping track, that was
Cribb's 7th career kill.

10:01.090 --> 10:04.600
Our next contest features one
of the more popular fighters.

10:05.289 --> 10:08.870
A rare find,
from the barren wastelands!

10:09.490 --> 10:12.539
A true champion who's got it all,
skill, speed and strength.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.639
Let's give it up
for the "Menace of Venice"...

10:17.289 --> 10:19.250
...the "Titan of Terror"...

10:19.690 --> 10:21.269
...the "Umpire of Agony"...

10:22.090 --> 10:24.299
...the one, the only...

10:25.090 --> 10:28.950
...Val Trepkos!

10:50.289 --> 10:51.370
You made it.

10:53.889 --> 10:55.009
Most don't.

10:55.090 --> 10:56.210
Careful, Jack.

10:58.690 --> 11:01.289
You should've seen
what he did to the Howlers.

11:02.289 --> 11:03.200
You set me up.

11:04.090 --> 11:04.960
It was a group effort.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.320
Let's get a look at those teeth.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.509
Teeth tell a lot about the bones.

11:17.289 --> 11:18.830
I told you to be careful.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.720
This one's got some attitude.

11:22.690 --> 11:23.600
That's good.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.740
He'll be a crowd pleaser.

12:00.289 --> 12:01.690
I asked for a room with a view.

12:08.090 --> 12:09.629
Guess you don't speak English.

12:20.690 --> 12:23.990
We'll have so much to talk
about during the long winter nights.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.769
Listen up, slaves.

12:33.289 --> 12:37.399
There's only one rule. It's real
simple, so you demons can remember.

12:41.690 --> 12:42.740
Stay inside the red.

12:44.090 --> 12:47.600
That wristband will make sure you do.
I know what you're thinking.

12:48.889 --> 12:52.509
You want to tear my throat out.
But you won't.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.649
Because there's only one way out.

12:56.690 --> 12:57.950
When that band comes off.

12:58.490 --> 13:01.970
And the only way that band comes off
is after your 21st kill.

13:06.889 --> 13:08.570
I'm not killing anyone.

13:09.889 --> 13:13.720
Then you'll be killed. Either way,
fans get their money's worth.

13:18.889 --> 13:21.730
Please let us know if you hear
from him. Thank you.

13:23.090 --> 13:24.769
- Cop lady hasn't talked to him?
- No.

13:24.889 --> 13:27.029
She seemed like
she didn't care either.

13:27.889 --> 13:30.379
- He's a missing person.
- He's only gone one night.

13:30.889 --> 13:33.379
He was supposed to check in
with us and didn't.

13:33.889 --> 13:35.750
And he's not someone who tans well.

13:36.289 --> 13:38.539
He's probably holed up,
waiting for nightfall.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.850
Maybe. But still,
something's very wrong.

13:42.289 --> 13:46.080
Our client, who should be waiting
by the phone, is nowhere to be found.

13:46.490 --> 13:49.750
Right. Keep trying to track him down.

13:50.690 --> 13:52.690
- What are you doing?
- Following his footsteps.

13:53.090 --> 13:55.690
- You're going to the bookie?
- That's where he went.

13:56.690 --> 14:00.169
Who gets his jollies cutting
off people's extremities?

14:00.889 --> 14:02.820
That's why I'm taking this.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.409
Along with a few other things.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.409
Looks like good gruel.

14:23.169 --> 14:24.750
Who the hell are you?

14:26.169 --> 14:27.250
I'm Angel.

14:28.570 --> 14:31.200
What you are is
a soon-to-be-dead slave.

14:33.370 --> 14:34.700
Shut up.

14:44.769 --> 14:46.980
- Cribb, that's mine!
- And now it's mine.

14:50.769 --> 14:51.820
Give it back.

14:55.570 --> 14:58.100
Open your mouth again,
I'll close it for good.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.299
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.559
Angel, guess how many vampires
I've killed.

15:30.970 --> 15:32.200
Catch you later.

15:44.169 --> 15:45.639
- Why'd you do that?
- You're welcome.

15:45.970 --> 15:49.059
I can fight my own battles.
I got two wins already.

15:50.169 --> 15:51.960
So just another 19 and you're out?

15:51.970 --> 15:55.870
That's right. You think I can't
cut it? You want a piece of me?

15:57.370 --> 15:59.649
No, not really.

16:01.570 --> 16:03.009
What's wrong with you?

16:03.970 --> 16:06.389
Don't be rocking the boat,
this is life and death.

16:08.769 --> 16:11.259
All right, girls, listen up.
Here's tonight's card.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.549
Lasovic, you're fighting Baker.

16:14.769 --> 16:18.460
Trepkos, you're the main event.
You'll go against Mellish.

16:20.769 --> 16:22.419
That's an execution.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.590
Shut your trap, slave.
No one's talking to you.

16:29.769 --> 16:31.659
I'm walking out of there tonight.

16:37.570 --> 16:38.870
You better know that.

16:41.169 --> 16:41.870
No!

16:53.769 --> 16:55.730
- We paid good money for that one.
- It's all right.

16:56.169 --> 16:58.029
It's an object lesson
for the others.

16:58.570 --> 17:01.940
- We'll have to find a replacement.
- What about Captain America here?

17:06.368 --> 17:09.069
Ice helps keep the swelling down.

17:09.970 --> 17:11.509
You got a hard head, boy.

17:12.970 --> 17:14.089
Stop that.

17:15.970 --> 17:16.839
Who's this?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.519
Wesley Wyndam-Price.
I'm looking for my employer.

17:20.769 --> 17:24.180
- He asked about Jack MacNamara.
- I'm kind of busy here.

17:24.970 --> 17:26.200
Where is he?

17:26.769 --> 17:31.339
Your boss? He gave me $200
to answer his questions.

17:32.769 --> 17:35.539
I'm a businessman. Make an offer.

17:41.170 --> 17:44.259
The man I work for
means a great deal to me.

17:45.369 --> 17:47.369
I will not give you
a single red cent.

17:48.369 --> 17:51.250
What I will do is
beat it out of you if I have to.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.710
You're from another country?

17:56.170 --> 17:57.400
Are you Robin Hood?

17:59.769 --> 18:00.930
Please drop those.

18:06.369 --> 18:07.420
You can go now.

18:14.769 --> 18:16.799
Now where is my employer?

18:18.569 --> 18:22.190
Ladies and gentlemen, the MacNamara
Brothers welcome you to a night...

18:22.769 --> 18:24.869
...of high-voltage entertainment!

18:25.769 --> 18:27.349
- I heard something interesting.
- What?

18:27.569 --> 18:30.980
- I heard the vampire has a soul.
- I wouldn't know about that.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.920
When he's fighting, do you think
that would be a plus or a minus?

18:36.569 --> 18:38.640
Depends on what he's fighting for.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.940
So you'll give me odds on him to win?

18:44.369 --> 18:46.160
I'll give you even money.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.609
I'll take that bet.

19:06.569 --> 19:08.430
Shouldn't go out there cold.

19:09.569 --> 19:11.109
Look, you did me one.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.849
Baker's fast, but his left eye
got hurt two fights ago.

19:14.970 --> 19:16.579
Stay on his left, tie him up.

19:17.369 --> 19:20.630
You can drive his head right into
the wall to get the kill.

19:21.569 --> 19:22.940
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

19:23.970 --> 19:26.849
You on drugs? It's not
like you have a choice.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.559
All right, girls. Showtime.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.460
Baker's challenger makes
his ring debut tonight.

19:41.970 --> 19:44.880
He's a highly skilled fighter
with a taste for blood.

19:45.569 --> 19:48.730
Let's welcome Angel!

19:57.569 --> 19:59.670
That vampire's not even fighting!

20:09.569 --> 20:11.250
Those two are perfect.

20:12.569 --> 20:13.730
- Did you bring the badge?
- No.

20:13.769 --> 20:15.700
- You said you--!
- Sir, madam.

20:16.170 --> 20:19.680
I'm Detective Andrews.
This is Detective Yelsew.

20:21.569 --> 20:22.480
Show them your badge.

20:23.970 --> 20:27.230
Write down their license number,
4, 3, Peter, Charlie, Edward.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.109
What are you doing?

20:29.369 --> 20:31.230
Sir, if you could give us your name.

20:31.769 --> 20:34.509
My name is Matthew Winslow,
as in Winslow Multimedia.

20:34.769 --> 20:37.089
I'm a friend of your boss,
Chief Tyler.

20:37.769 --> 20:40.369
We'll give him your best.
Could I see your tickets?

20:41.369 --> 20:43.440
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer tonight.

20:43.769 --> 20:47.029
Are you aware that you've purchased
tickets to an unlicensed event?

20:50.369 --> 20:51.450
Answer the detective!

20:52.769 --> 20:55.400
If it's illegal, what are
all these people doing here?

20:56.369 --> 20:58.539
We're trying to do you
a favor, Mr. Winslow.

20:59.369 --> 21:02.180
Something's going down tonight.
Something with the Man.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.130
- A raid?
- We're not at liberty to say.

21:07.769 --> 21:09.519
But we could just go on home?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.779
I think that would be wise, sir.

21:20.369 --> 21:21.170
You almost blew it!

21:21.569 --> 21:22.579
I saved us.

21:22.769 --> 21:24.839
"Something's going down with the Man?"

21:28.769 --> 21:32.029
Idiot. Thinks he can get out
of this by pulling a Ghandi.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.309
I think we found our missing client.

21:58.769 --> 21:59.640
Oh, my God!

22:01.170 --> 22:02.180
What is this?

22:02.369 --> 22:05.319
These Octavian matches date back
to the Roman Empire.

22:06.569 --> 22:08.460
I'd heard rumors of a revival.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.039
Couldn't they just do
West Side Story?

22:13.170 --> 22:14.250
What's with the bracelets?

22:14.970 --> 22:19.539
If they cross the red line
while wearing one, they disintegrate.

22:21.569 --> 22:22.369
Oh.

22:29.970 --> 22:31.130
Oh, my God.

23:00.569 --> 23:01.509
Angel! Angel!

23:04.769 --> 23:08.390
Official time:
seven minutes, 33 seconds.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.319
This marks the first
of what promises to be...

23:11.970 --> 23:15.549
...many more kills
by the vampire, Angel!

23:17.369 --> 23:18.559
Angel! Angel!

23:31.170 --> 23:33.559
Trepkos and Mellish, showtime.

23:37.769 --> 23:39.839
Wait. If no one fights,
no one dies.

23:40.769 --> 23:42.420
Quit moping. You're alive.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.039
Baker isn't.

23:44.369 --> 23:46.259
One lucky kill don't
make you an expert.

23:46.769 --> 23:50.390
That wasn't the first life I've taken.
Or the 21st.

23:50.970 --> 23:53.809
Trepkos, Mellish, let's go.

23:56.369 --> 23:59.039
We can fight them
if we stop fighting each other.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.910
- Now.
- I'm giving you another way out.

24:06.569 --> 24:08.079
I'll kill him quick.

24:13.170 --> 24:14.819
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up...

24:14.970 --> 24:19.220
...for one of your favorite
fighters, Val Trepkos!

24:30.569 --> 24:33.059
- We gotta call the police.
- That's a bad idea.

24:33.569 --> 24:35.849
If they're not already in on this...

24:35.970 --> 24:38.500
...then MacNamara would destroy
the evidence.

24:39.569 --> 24:42.799
He'd kill the fighters.
We've gotta get Angel out of there.

24:43.170 --> 24:45.519
To do that, we have to get
him out of the cuffs.

24:46.170 --> 24:49.539
- They were made by ancient sorcerers.
- So get an ancient key.

24:50.970 --> 24:54.549
I might be able to make one myself,
if I could get one of the cuffs...

24:55.170 --> 24:56.359
...which won't be easy--

24:56.970 --> 24:59.849
Unless you procured one
while I wasn't looking.

25:01.769 --> 25:03.099
- Well done.
- Thank you.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.390
That was the most exciting
match I've ever seen.

25:08.970 --> 25:11.950
My favorite part was when you stuck
Baker with the knife.

25:13.769 --> 25:16.259
Kind of put a damper
on the brotherhood spiel.

25:17.970 --> 25:20.950
What'd you expect? You're a demon,
like the rest of them.

25:21.569 --> 25:23.369
The difference is,
they know their place.

25:23.369 --> 25:26.490
Somebody needs to put you in yours.
You and your brother.

25:28.769 --> 25:31.230
Someone may...someday.

25:32.369 --> 25:34.789
But not you, and not today.

25:35.970 --> 25:39.019
Why put off till tomorrow
what you can do today?

25:43.769 --> 25:45.519
Any closer and he's dead.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.240
Tell me how to get this off.

25:49.769 --> 25:52.609
How does it open?
Is there some kind of a key?

25:53.369 --> 25:55.049
Where's the key, Jack?

25:56.369 --> 25:58.789
Check his pockets. Cribb.
Trepkos. Any of you.

25:59.369 --> 26:02.779
A little help would be nice.
Or I can just do it myself.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.759
What did I tell you, huh?
Now you're really alone.

26:08.369 --> 26:10.259
I got you. Get his brother!

26:10.769 --> 26:14.700
Look at him! Is this who you're all
so afraid of going up against?

26:15.569 --> 26:17.079
How does it feel, Jack?

26:17.369 --> 26:20.069
Tell them how it feels
to be in here. Come on!

26:20.970 --> 26:22.759
How does it feel to be a slave?

26:26.369 --> 26:27.240
Tell them!

26:28.769 --> 26:31.470
- Let him go.
- As soon as you let us go.

26:32.369 --> 26:34.859
What do you think you are? Moses?

26:35.369 --> 26:37.470
You'll listen if you want
your brother back.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.089
- Last chance.
- Come on, Darin.

26:40.769 --> 26:42.910
There's only one way
this can play out...

26:43.170 --> 26:45.490
...so let's just get it done.
He's your brother.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.539
Now he's my dead brother.

27:15.650 --> 27:16.839
How do you feel?

27:18.049 --> 27:21.069
Like I was hit by lightning
after the truck ran me over.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.440
I remember you.

27:24.049 --> 27:27.420
We didn't get a chance to meet.
I'm Lilah Morgan.

27:28.849 --> 27:30.599
You're a fight fan.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.579
And a lawyer.

27:33.049 --> 27:36.670
- Let me guess, Wolfram and Hart.
- I'm an associate here.

27:37.849 --> 27:41.539
After some arm-twisting, I convinced
MacNamara to sell your contract.

27:45.049 --> 27:47.369
He knows keeping you would be
too much trouble.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.119
Congratulations, you're free.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.279
As long as I pretend
it never happened.

27:54.650 --> 27:56.970
That MacNamara and his circus
don't exist.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.509
That is the deal, isn't it?

28:03.650 --> 28:07.579
It's a big city, Angel.
A lot of people need your help.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.930
You're a good Samaritan and this pact
with the devil is just an act?

28:13.250 --> 28:15.349
Sometimes you have to compromise.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.880
Look the other way when
Wolfram and Hart are involved?

28:19.250 --> 28:22.690
I prefer to think of it as picking
the battles you can win.

28:24.049 --> 28:26.680
There's not one reason
why we can't work together.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.440
You're right.

28:45.049 --> 28:46.660
There are about a thousand.

28:48.650 --> 28:53.220
I saw what you did to Baker,
so I know you want to survive.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.000
This is your only chance. Take it.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.000
Thanks for the champagne.

29:07.849 --> 29:10.099
Relax. Take me back.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.940
Don't people get enough
violence watching Springer?

29:27.730 --> 29:30.849
Cordelia, do you mind?
I'm trying to concentrate.

29:32.529 --> 29:34.529
You've been concentrating all night.

29:34.930 --> 29:37.250
It's taken this long
to translate the text.

29:37.329 --> 29:41.680
I need something that conducts
electricity, but not too much of it.

29:42.730 --> 29:46.730
This cuff is half magic,
half medieval technology!

29:48.130 --> 29:51.109
If I've read the alchemists
correctly, all I need--

29:54.730 --> 29:56.730
Ouch! Are you okay?

29:58.930 --> 30:03.250
Perhaps something that conducts
a little less electricity.

30:19.329 --> 30:20.589
He was free.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.829
Bloodsucker's crazier than I thought.

30:25.930 --> 30:28.279
Think you're proving something
by coming back?

30:34.329 --> 30:37.029
They didn't help you before.
They won't help you now.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.490
They know the only way
out of here is by himself.

30:40.930 --> 30:44.829
You'll find that out soon, because
tonight you're gonna fight Trepkos.

30:47.529 --> 30:49.880
Smart money says he's walking out.

30:49.930 --> 30:51.470
You're his 21st kill.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.049
Too thick.

31:16.369 --> 31:17.839
Tick, tick, Wesley!

31:18.170 --> 31:19.569
I don't know what else to try.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.569
We need something supple
enough to thread...

31:22.970 --> 31:25.069
...but strong enough
to spring the release.

31:25.970 --> 31:27.130
Horsehair.

31:27.769 --> 31:29.519
- Horsehair?
- From Keanu.

31:29.569 --> 31:31.779
My palomino before the IRS
took him away.

31:35.569 --> 31:36.480
Horsehair.

31:37.369 --> 31:39.470
Well, we tried just about
everything else.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.130
Ten thousand on Trepkos.

32:00.170 --> 32:03.150
Tonight's match features
a new favorite in the ring...

32:03.769 --> 32:05.069
...a vampire.

32:05.569 --> 32:08.170
Please welcome,
for the second night in a row...

32:08.569 --> 32:12.539
...and still fresh
from his first kill, Angel!

32:14.569 --> 32:17.450
His opponent is a favorite
who needs no introduction.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.380
This marks his 21st
and final fight.

32:21.170 --> 32:25.700
Let's give a special welcome
to a true champion, Val Trepkos!

32:35.569 --> 32:38.869
Is this how you want to pay
for your freedom? With 21 bodies?

32:40.970 --> 32:44.619
You'll always be their slave
even if they take that cuff off.

32:48.769 --> 32:51.509
- I'll kill you quick.
- I won't let you.

33:10.369 --> 33:12.690
Vampire's gonna get
his head ripped off.

33:13.369 --> 33:15.369
Maybe his heart torn out.

33:15.769 --> 33:16.930
What a loser.

33:34.369 --> 33:37.809
Can you help me? I'm a little lost.

33:39.170 --> 33:42.500
I'm looking for the ladies' room.
They said it was this way.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.670
Or is it up a level?

33:55.369 --> 33:57.470
Excuse me! Come here.

33:57.769 --> 33:58.849
Yes, you.

34:03.170 --> 34:07.029
I need to see Angel.
Tall fellow, prominent brow.

34:07.970 --> 34:09.018
Yeah, he's dead.

34:10.369 --> 34:13.039
- Dead?
- He will be. He's fighting Trepkos.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.510
Who the hell are you?

34:17.570 --> 34:19.920
A friend.
Perhaps we can help each other.

34:19.969 --> 34:21.340
- I have a key.
- A key?

34:22.969 --> 34:26.159
Help me save Angel and I'll
get all of you out.

34:27.170 --> 34:28.849
If we band together--

34:31.369 --> 34:33.369
Give that back! Hey!

35:22.849 --> 35:25.269
- What happened?
- One of them took my key.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.989
Angel can't last.
We have to do something now!

35:36.050 --> 35:37.130
We will.

35:57.050 --> 35:59.369
Killing blow! Killing blow!

36:10.250 --> 36:12.349
Angel! Angel!

36:30.050 --> 36:31.909
Killing blow! Killing blow!

37:04.849 --> 37:06.780
Killing blow! Killing blow!

37:40.289 --> 37:41.340
Both of them.

37:46.289 --> 37:47.800
Call them off.

37:52.289 --> 37:53.730
Screw you.

38:12.690 --> 38:13.880
Give me your wrist...

38:14.489 --> 38:15.539
...loser.

38:39.090 --> 38:40.769
You stupid slave.

38:42.090 --> 38:43.530
You had your 21...

38:43.889 --> 38:46.280
...but you had to ruin it
for everybody else.

38:49.289 --> 38:50.519
Trepkos...

38:51.090 --> 38:52.210
...catch.

39:12.690 --> 39:14.550
- Easy.
- Thanks.

39:15.090 --> 39:16.880
- Thanks.
- It was a good fight.

39:22.289 --> 39:23.619
I could've taken you.

39:25.889 --> 39:27.780
Angel, you don't look so....

39:28.289 --> 39:30.639
- It's a good thing you heal fast.
- Yeah.

39:31.289 --> 39:33.429
It's also a good thing you found me.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.780
We weren't gonna let anything
happen to you.

39:38.489 --> 39:41.820
I mean, beyond the slavery
and the severe beatings.

39:42.690 --> 39:44.269
Wesley came up with the key.

39:44.489 --> 39:47.469
But Cordelia came up with the key
to the key.

39:48.090 --> 39:50.409
You both did great.

39:51.090 --> 39:54.280
I think we did a good thing
here tonight.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.579
Yes, we set the captives free.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.989
Actually, didn't we set
a bunch of demons free?

40:04.889 --> 40:08.260
Oh, well, technically....
Yes.
