WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.503
? Boy, the way Glenn Miller played ?

00:05.571 --> 00:09.107
? songs that made the hit parade ?

00:09.174 --> 00:12.811

00:19.919 --> 00:23.587

01:01.160 --> 01:02.994
hey, something smells good.

01:03.061 --> 01:04.629
What's for dinner? Pot roast.

01:04.697 --> 01:08.767
And Archie's favorite
dessert, rice pudding,

01:08.834 --> 01:10.535
with raisins

01:10.603 --> 01:12.771
and a few bran flakes.

01:17.743 --> 01:19.644
Bran flakes in rice pudding?

01:19.711 --> 01:23.848
Yeah. We ran out of raisins, and
it was too late to go shoppin',

01:23.916 --> 01:27.452
so I took the raisins out
of the raisin bran cereal.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.358
So, tomorrow morning if your
cereal don't taste raisiny,

01:33.426 --> 01:36.060
it's 'cause you ate your raisins tonight.

01:39.031 --> 01:42.367
I hate this day and it ain't over yet.

01:42.435 --> 01:46.204
Oh, Archie, what happened?

01:46.271 --> 01:48.306
Oh, it all started this morning.

01:48.373 --> 01:50.875
I go to work, I'm runnin' for
the damn time clock there,

01:50.943 --> 01:55.413
I slid on a bunch of grapes,
fell right on my keister.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.383
I'll show you the black and
blue mark before we go to bed.

01:59.451 --> 02:02.820
Then stretch Cunningham
sits on my sandwich bag,

02:02.888 --> 02:05.523
he crushes the peanut
butter and jelly sandwich,

02:05.591 --> 02:08.092
wipin' out the twinkie at the same time.

02:11.196 --> 02:12.964
And then on my comfort break,

02:13.032 --> 02:15.399
my cigar falls out of my
mouth and into the toilet.

02:17.536 --> 02:22.206
I know right then and there I ain't gonna
be livin' through my finest hours.

02:22.274 --> 02:25.009
Will you get out of the chair?
Get out of the chair.

02:25.077 --> 02:26.110
Yeah.

02:26.178 --> 02:28.279
Ah, poor Archie.

02:28.347 --> 02:30.582
And then the topper of all, Edith,

02:30.649 --> 02:33.751
as the French used to say,
the piece of resistance,

02:35.087 --> 02:37.889
I'm on a subway and I get a burn hole,

02:37.957 --> 02:41.125
right there, in my best
coming-home-from-work pants.

02:41.193 --> 02:43.561
Oh, my.

02:43.628 --> 02:47.798
Oh, Archie, I can't fix that,
that has to be weaved.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.901
Woved.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.337
You shouldn't have been
smokin' on the subway anyway.

02:52.404 --> 02:54.706
I wasn't smokin', little girl.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.675
A guy standin' over me was smokin',

02:56.742 --> 02:59.310
he was usin' me for an ashtray there.

02:59.378 --> 03:02.480
And look at that, Edith. That
was very close, you know.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.990
I felt like kickin' him right in the ankle.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.728
But he was a black guy, so I let it go.

03:18.731 --> 03:21.799
Gee, you're gettin' pretty
tolerant in your old age.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.901
He was as big as muhammad ally.

03:27.239 --> 03:29.207
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:29.274 --> 03:32.210
What the hell are you doing?

03:32.277 --> 03:34.713
Oh, Michael's got a new hobby, macrame.

03:34.780 --> 03:35.880
(Gloria) He's making me a new belt.

03:35.948 --> 03:37.515
(Edith) Ain't it pretty?

03:37.582 --> 03:39.451
Maca-roni? What?

03:40.319 --> 03:41.987
Macrame.

03:46.358 --> 03:47.725
Don't say it.

03:50.529 --> 03:52.530
There ain't nothing to say, Florence.

03:55.701 --> 03:57.268
You said it.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.405
Will you stop doin' that?

04:00.473 --> 04:02.873
Some friend of mine might
come walkin' through the door

04:02.941 --> 04:05.943
and find out that I got a
fruitcake for a son-in-law.

04:07.279 --> 04:09.714
Daddy, there's nothing effeminate about it.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.650
Lots of men are doin' hobbies like that.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.685
Yeah. Rosey grier does needlepoint,

04:13.753 --> 04:15.653
would you call him a fruitcake?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.555
There's no such thing as a colored fag.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.260
What?

04:22.328 --> 04:23.694
You don't believe me?

04:23.762 --> 04:26.431
Walk up to any colored guy and
ask him, "are you a fag?"

04:29.335 --> 04:32.437
Your tonsils will be
wearing your moustache.

04:34.439 --> 04:37.275
Edith, get dinner on the table there, huh?

04:37.342 --> 04:38.409
It's all ready.

04:38.477 --> 04:41.212
I just hope it ain't too well done for you.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.881
You was a little late tonight, Archie.

04:43.949 --> 04:46.617
Well, I stopped in kelcy's
on the way home for a beer.

04:46.685 --> 04:48.152
And who do you think is in there

04:48.220 --> 04:49.921
spendin' money, hand over fist,

04:49.989 --> 04:51.822
buyin' drinks for the whole joint?

04:51.924 --> 04:54.458
Who? Your neighbor here, George Jefferson.

04:54.526 --> 04:57.995
Oh, my, wasn't that nice of him?

04:58.063 --> 05:01.131
Wasn't nothin' nice about it.
The guy's just showin' off.

05:01.199 --> 05:04.435
He happens to be makin' a few extra
bucks now with his cleanin' stores

05:04.503 --> 05:05.970
and that's it.

05:06.037 --> 05:08.706
Comes a walkin' into kelcy's
there, making a lot of noise

05:08.774 --> 05:11.342
with a wad of bills big
enough to choke a dog.

05:11.409 --> 05:15.412
Shootin' his mouth off. I hate it
when them people try acting white.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.484
Yeah. But you drank his beers, didn't you?

05:19.551 --> 05:20.985
Certainly, I did.

05:21.053 --> 05:23.621
I figured he was up to somethin'
and I wanted to find out what.

05:23.689 --> 05:26.424
Why, just because a guy acts
nice, he has to have an angle?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.058
Always.

05:28.126 --> 05:30.694
If I had your attitude,
I'd go live in a cave.

05:30.762 --> 05:33.297
You'd live anywhere that was rent-free.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.170
I'm telling you, Louise,
you should've seen bunker

05:39.238 --> 05:41.072
guzzlin' down all that free beer.

05:41.139 --> 05:45.076
He couldn't even say, "thank
you," he was too busy belching.

05:45.143 --> 05:47.912
Well, if it bothered you, you
shouldn't have bought him any.

05:47.979 --> 05:49.947
I had to, that's politics.

05:50.015 --> 05:51.716
Look, when you're running for office,

05:51.783 --> 05:54.052
you have to do a whole lot of
things you don't believe in.

05:54.119 --> 05:56.888
George, that's not exactly honest.

05:56.922 --> 06:00.658
What's honesty got to do with politics?

06:00.725 --> 06:04.662
I'm running for republican county
committee, not the boy scouts.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.731
That's not for you, it's for the church.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.267
Good night, people.

06:09.334 --> 06:11.669
Where you think you goin'?
Out to dinner, with Jenny.

06:11.737 --> 06:13.638
Mmm-hmm, if you was any kind of son,

06:13.705 --> 06:16.040
you'd stay here and help me get
some signatures on my petition,

06:16.108 --> 06:18.810
instead of runnin' around the
streets with miss half and half.

06:19.745 --> 06:21.146
There you go again.

06:21.213 --> 06:24.315
Fine son you are, after all I'm
trying to do for your community.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.683
Oh, like what?

06:25.751 --> 06:27.419
Like all the things you
been complaining about.

06:27.486 --> 06:28.853
Improving housing,

06:28.921 --> 06:31.422
fighting crime, cleaning up the streets.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.023
You really serious about this, pop?

06:33.091 --> 06:34.258
As sure as I'm standin' here.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.593
Ok, well, I can't help you tonight,

06:35.661 --> 06:37.027
but tomorrow night for sure, all right?

06:37.095 --> 06:38.229
All right, we'll see.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.197
Good night. Give my love to Jenny.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.299
Oh, thanks, mom.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.867
And you, pop?

06:42.934 --> 06:44.835
Oh, same goes for me, give
her your mother's love.

06:48.173 --> 06:50.341
George, if you get on that committee,

06:50.409 --> 06:52.677
are you really gonna do all
those things you said?

06:52.745 --> 06:53.778
Sure I am.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.913
After I get them to change that zoning law.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.549
Zoning law? What zoning law?

06:58.617 --> 06:59.650
The one that's stopping me

06:59.718 --> 07:01.485
from breaking through the
wall of our cleaning shop

07:01.553 --> 07:04.122
and taking over the store next door.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.889
Uh-huh!

07:05.957 --> 07:07.791
You don't wanna help the community,

07:07.859 --> 07:09.960
you just wanna feather your own nest.

07:10.028 --> 07:11.662
It's your nest, too, Louise.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.032
And I'm sharin' it with a cuckoo.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.335
Look, don't fight me, weezy.

07:17.403 --> 07:20.505
It's my big chance to get into the
system and make it work for us.

07:20.572 --> 07:22.607
Even if you have to lie to do it.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.877
In politics, lies are called promises.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.679
And promises are made to
be broken, right? Right.

07:30.382 --> 07:33.251
And remember, don't touch that cake.

07:33.318 --> 07:34.485
I promise.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.391
Well, that's politics.

07:46.932 --> 07:48.866
Pass me the pot roast, please.

08:02.681 --> 08:04.615
Hand me the gravy, please.

08:12.858 --> 08:14.825
Can you hand me a roll?

08:22.468 --> 08:24.636
What is this?

08:24.703 --> 08:26.904
No wonder I can never
finish dinner around here,

08:26.972 --> 08:29.707
I'm always too busy waitin' on you.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.075
Here. Here's the roll.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.510
There's the peas and carrots.
There's the potatoes.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.847
Get it all. It's all gonna
wind up down there anyway.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.051
You forgot the butter.

08:49.094 --> 08:50.294
[Doorbell ringing]

08:50.362 --> 08:51.862
I'll get it.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.599
Whoever it is, tell him, "get out of here."

08:56.402 --> 09:00.571
Oh, hello, Mr. Jefferson. Come in.

09:00.638 --> 09:02.406
Louise asked me to bring this over.

09:02.474 --> 09:05.576
Oh, my.

09:05.644 --> 09:08.646
It's beautiful. Oh, thank you.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.649
Archie, look what Louise sent over.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.984
If it's one of her cats I don't want it.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.554
It's a cake.

09:16.621 --> 09:19.423
Oh, a cake. Well, stick that down
in front of the meathead, too.

09:20.992 --> 09:23.994
Mr. Jefferson, would like a cup of coffee?

09:24.062 --> 09:25.663
Ah. Don't mind if I do.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.198
Oh, Archie,

09:27.265 --> 09:30.033
why don't you show
Mr. Jefferson your pants?

09:30.135 --> 09:32.970
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.072
As long as you're over here, Jefferson, uh,

09:35.140 --> 09:37.909
maybe you could give me your
professional opinion, uh,

09:38.877 --> 09:40.278
on this here.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.149
It's a hole.

09:50.422 --> 09:52.323
No kidding.

09:52.391 --> 09:56.360
What I wanted to know is how much
you'd charge me to fix that hole.

09:56.362 --> 10:00.031
Well, a weaving job like
that will run you about $12.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.001
That's more than I paid for
the pants 4 years ago.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.802
In those days holes were
a lot cheaper, too.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.404
[Archie groans]

10:06.406 --> 10:08.940
Here you are, Mr. Jefferson. Thank you.

10:09.007 --> 10:10.407
Uh, bunker, uh,

10:10.475 --> 10:12.676
I brought this petition
over for you to sign.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.011
A petition?

10:14.079 --> 10:15.813
Yeah, I'm passing it
around the neighborhood.

10:15.881 --> 10:19.250
Why, some more puerto
ricans trying to get in?

10:19.317 --> 10:23.554
No, I'm trying to get in. I'm running
for the republican county committee.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.090
You don't look like a republican.

10:26.157 --> 10:28.192
What's a republican supposed to look like?

10:28.260 --> 10:30.260
Oh, I don't mean that. I just thought that,

10:30.328 --> 10:33.597
Eleanor Roosevelt turned all
youse people into democrats.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.132
Well, not me,

10:35.200 --> 10:39.203
because the elephant always seemed
bigger and smarter than jackass.

10:39.271 --> 10:42.506
Right now there are a lot of
elephants that feel like jackasses.

10:49.347 --> 10:50.481
Shut up.

10:51.416 --> 10:52.416
Ah,

10:52.483 --> 10:54.118
[blowing a raspberry]

10:54.385 --> 10:55.653
Gloria.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.755
You raised her.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.491
Little Emily post over here.

11:01.627 --> 11:02.927
Well, let me tell you something.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.628
You and that meatheaded husband of yours

11:04.696 --> 11:06.797
that elected all them
democrats that just got in,

11:06.865 --> 11:09.500
they better not get in the way
of president Gerald t. Ford's

11:09.568 --> 11:11.602
big plans for whippin' this here inflation.

11:11.669 --> 11:16.106
Oh, what big plans? Making
us all wear win buttons?

11:16.174 --> 11:17.241
What the hell's the matter with that?

11:17.308 --> 11:18.876
I think it's a great idea.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.946
Come on, arch, nobody's gonna wear them.

11:22.013 --> 11:25.315
That's one of the biggest
nobody-gives-a-damns of all time.

11:25.383 --> 11:26.617
Well, I give a damn

11:26.685 --> 11:29.286
and I'm gonna wear one 'cause I wanna win!

11:32.257 --> 11:35.359
You better buy your
button today, arch. Why?

11:35.427 --> 11:37.528
The price of them goes up next week.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.799
I think Mr. Jefferson just wants us

11:41.867 --> 11:43.600
to sign his petition.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.369
Oh, are you a registered republican, Edith?

11:45.436 --> 11:47.772
No, she's a registered dingbat.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.776
I'm the only republican in this house.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.812
Ah, let me look this thing over.
See what we got here.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.881
It ain't a I.O.U. Just
go ahead and sign it.

11:56.948 --> 11:58.482
Oh. Hold it, hold it, Jefferson.

11:58.549 --> 12:01.351
I don't go around signing
political documentaries,

12:01.419 --> 12:02.987
just like that, you know.

12:03.054 --> 12:05.355
I mean, even Abe Lincoln,
as smart as he was,

12:05.423 --> 12:06.991
he read the declaration of independence

12:07.058 --> 12:09.293
before he put his John hancock on it.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.831
Archie, are you sure

12:13.899 --> 12:19.369
Abraham Lincoln signed the
declaration of independence?

12:19.437 --> 12:21.572
Sure, 4 score and 7 years ago.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.209
Look, you can sign right here.

12:25.377 --> 12:29.080
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Let
me read the thing, will you?

12:29.147 --> 12:32.349
So that's why you were springing for
all them beers in kelcy's there, huh?

12:32.417 --> 12:34.118
I figured you was up to something.

12:34.185 --> 12:36.920
Yeah, I also figured could do a lot
for the people in this district.

12:36.988 --> 12:38.656
Which people are you talkin' about?

12:38.723 --> 12:40.224
Look, I know what you're thinking, bunker,

12:40.291 --> 12:41.625
but I'm talking about all the people:

12:41.693 --> 12:44.161
Blacks, browns, yellows, and whites.

12:44.228 --> 12:46.230
How come you put the whites last?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.201
Look, I just wanna help the community.

12:50.268 --> 12:51.435
[Telephone ringing]

12:51.503 --> 12:52.803
Edith, the phone.

12:54.072 --> 12:55.672
Well, if you wanna help the community,

12:55.740 --> 12:57.875
you could bring the prices
down in your store there.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.878
I mean, $12 to fix that
hole, that's a disgrace.

13:01.913 --> 13:04.514
Yeah, Louise, he's here.

13:04.582 --> 13:06.050
(Edith) Oh.

13:08.319 --> 13:12.890
Louise wants to know what
happened to her chocolate cake.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.226
Oh, the cake, huh?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.328
Tell Louise that George is over here

13:17.396 --> 13:19.297
trying to buy votes with it.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.933
Yeah, I'll tell him, Louise.

13:23.001 --> 13:24.368
Goodbye.

13:24.436 --> 13:29.006
Louise wants to see you
back home, right away.

13:29.073 --> 13:30.107
Imagine that.

13:30.175 --> 13:32.009
Only one day in politics

13:32.077 --> 13:34.645
and already he's stealin' and bribin'.

13:36.314 --> 13:39.717
And now he expects me to sign
this here petition of his.

13:39.785 --> 13:43.321
Look, I hear you loud and clear,
bunker, and I don't need you anyway.

13:45.657 --> 13:47.658
You ain't the only honky on the beach.

13:51.529 --> 13:53.097
Can you beat that?

13:53.164 --> 13:55.232
A guy comes waltzing in here

13:55.300 --> 13:57.501
with a petition, wants me to sign the thing

13:57.568 --> 13:58.702
without even readin' it.

13:58.769 --> 14:00.937
Now, I mean, he takes the cake.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.530
Hi, weezy.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.300
Well, I seen happier faces at a funeral,

14:29.368 --> 14:31.835
including on the deceased.

14:32.737 --> 14:34.505
I've been ringing doorbells for 2 hours.

14:34.572 --> 14:36.740
You know how many signatures I got? One.

14:36.807 --> 14:38.609
Well, that's better than nothin'.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.011
Who signed? Me.

14:41.746 --> 14:43.247
Everybody asks the same question:

14:43.315 --> 14:45.716
"How come your neighbor,
Archie bunker, didn't sign?"

14:45.784 --> 14:48.318
Well, if Archie's signature
is so important,

14:48.386 --> 14:50.087
maybe you ought to tell him the truth.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.790
I ain't goin' over there beggin' him.
I got my pride.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.526
You also got a blank petition.

14:55.593 --> 14:57.761
Now you better get over
there and work on Archie,

14:57.829 --> 15:00.364
even if it kills you
. It just might do that.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.236
But we've already suffered for 300 years,

15:05.304 --> 15:07.671
I guess a few more minutes won't hurt.

15:10.742 --> 15:12.776
(Archie) I don't want to
talk about it no more.

15:12.844 --> 15:14.945
I told you that a million times.
Just leave me alone.

15:15.013 --> 15:16.379
Arch, tell me the real reason

15:16.447 --> 15:18.315
you wouldn't sign Jefferson's petition.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.684
'Cause he didn't want to give me
time to read it. Oh, come on,

15:20.686 --> 15:22.986
that's not it. The thing is 5 lines long.

15:23.054 --> 15:25.956
The real reason is because
he's black, right?

15:26.024 --> 15:29.660
Well, if you knew the real reason,
why the hell did you ask me?

15:29.728 --> 15:32.229
Daddy, 1 out of 8 Americans is black.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.765
It's only fair they be represented, too.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.800
What does that mean? If
I got an 8-room house,

15:36.868 --> 15:39.970
I got to keep a colored
guy in one of the rooms?

15:40.038 --> 15:42.173
I knew you'd say something
stupid like that.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.174
Well, then, you wasn't disappointed.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.845
You know, I've been thinkin'.

15:47.913 --> 15:52.083
George Jefferson would be
very good in politics.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.517
Take his name.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.485
George is the first name

15:55.553 --> 15:56.954
of a famous president,

15:57.022 --> 16:00.825
and Jefferson is the last
name of a famous president,

16:00.892 --> 16:02.659
put them all together,

16:02.727 --> 16:05.796
and you got-- and you get
a colored pants-presser.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.965
Get me a beer, will ya?

16:08.032 --> 16:09.266
All right.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.201
The man wants to serve the community.

16:11.269 --> 16:13.237
W-why won't you at least give him a chance?

16:13.271 --> 16:15.673
I got nothing against the
coloreds servin' the community.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.175
I don't want 'em to run the community.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.777
Daddy, Los Angeles has a black mayor.

16:20.845 --> 16:23.581
Yeah, that's right and it was the
white voters that put him in.

16:23.648 --> 16:26.684
Well, maybe they was tired of
havin' their city burned down.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.788
You know somethin', arch,

16:31.856 --> 16:33.690
if stupid remarks were an olympic event,

16:33.758 --> 16:36.593
you'd be a gold medal winner.

16:36.661 --> 16:39.830
At least I'd bring the medal back to the u.
S. Of a. Get away.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.099
Edith, what are you doing in there, huh?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.634
Arch, you have to have racial
balance in government.

16:44.702 --> 16:47.104
Get away from me, will you?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.738
Look at this. Coming through.

16:48.806 --> 16:50.074
You know what you nearly done?

16:50.141 --> 16:52.343
You nearly mashed me with
the swinging kitchen door.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.444
Oh, I'm sorry, Archie.

16:53.511 --> 16:54.678
Where's my beer?

16:54.745 --> 16:56.580
Oh, in the refrigerator. Refrigerator.

16:56.647 --> 16:58.148
I'm gonna get it. I'll get it myself.

16:58.216 --> 17:00.551
Arch, racial balance is
important in everything.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.319
Take education.

17:02.387 --> 17:04.788
Why do you think it's so tough for a
black student to become a doctor?

17:04.856 --> 17:07.991
Because nobody wants to see a black
guy comin' at him with a knife.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.633
You just won another gold medal.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.901
Ah, get away.

17:17.969 --> 17:19.435
Coming through.

17:19.503 --> 17:21.638
You see what you nearly
almost done again there?

17:21.705 --> 17:23.874
Mashed me in that swinging door. Oh.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.474
You're supposed to yell "coming through,"

17:25.542 --> 17:27.410
when you're still on your side of the door

17:27.478 --> 17:29.546
not when you're already
on my side of the door.

17:29.614 --> 17:31.148
[Doorbell ringing] (Mike) I'll get it.

17:31.215 --> 17:33.517
Leave the door alone. I hate
when people come into the house

17:33.584 --> 17:35.753
and the first thing they see is you.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.754
Come in, Mr. Jefferson.

17:37.822 --> 17:40.590
Oh, well, well, well, well,
if it ain't Jefferson.

17:40.659 --> 17:41.659
(Mike) Hi, Mr. Jefferson.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.393
What are you hustlin' this time?

17:43.461 --> 17:45.763
Well, bunker, I just
came over to apologize.

17:45.830 --> 17:49.099
I, uh, maybe I lost my head the
last time I was over here.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.700
Well, if we see it rolling around,

17:50.769 --> 17:53.470
I'll send it back with Edith.

17:53.537 --> 17:56.540
Mr. Jefferson, what are you apologizing for?
You didn't do anything.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.910
No, I was wrong, and when I'm
wrong, I'm the first to admit it.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.345
When I asked you to sign the petition,

18:01.412 --> 18:02.679
I should have told you my real reason

18:02.747 --> 18:04.080
for wanting to get on the committee.

18:04.148 --> 18:07.618
Ooh, gee. When a politician
stoops to honesty.

18:07.685 --> 18:10.620
Wow. That's something. Ok, Jefferson.
Talk on.

18:10.688 --> 18:11.889
[George sighing]

18:11.956 --> 18:13.590
Well, you know that store

18:13.658 --> 18:14.825
next to my shop on the corner?

18:14.893 --> 18:16.226
Yeah, I know the store.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.195
Well, I wanna buy it,

18:18.263 --> 18:20.397
bust out the sides,

18:20.464 --> 18:22.065
and expand my business.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.734
Oh, you don't need a petition.
You need a bulldozer.

18:27.104 --> 18:28.405
But first,

18:28.473 --> 18:30.974
I gotta have the zoning law changed.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.277
Oh, oh, oh!

18:33.345 --> 18:35.246
I get it. So that's why you want to get on

18:35.313 --> 18:37.281
the republican county committee.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.382
That's right.

18:38.449 --> 18:40.450
I figure a nice, big cleaning plant

18:40.518 --> 18:43.387
would beautify that corner. You know,
get rid of that ugly flower shop.

18:43.454 --> 18:44.454
(Archie) Yeah.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.125
Never stops, never stops.

18:48.192 --> 18:50.193
Everybody's out for number one.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.661
What's wrong with that, meathead?

18:51.729 --> 18:53.497
That's the American way.

18:53.565 --> 18:56.200
Government of the people, by the people,
and for the pursuit of happiness.

18:59.070 --> 19:01.038
And I ain't signing that damn petition

19:01.105 --> 19:03.707
till I find out what's in it
for this here number one.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.342
Oh, that's beautiful.

19:05.409 --> 19:06.643
Certainly, it is.

19:06.711 --> 19:08.212
If I wash his hands,

19:08.279 --> 19:09.980
then he can use them hands

19:10.048 --> 19:12.449
to fix the hole in my pants.

19:12.516 --> 19:15.085
For nothing, right, Jefferson?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.319
Done. Wait a minute.

19:16.387 --> 19:18.255
That's only the "a" part of the deal.

19:20.157 --> 19:21.625
The "b" part of the deal

19:21.693 --> 19:23.426
is that the bunker family, from now on,

19:23.495 --> 19:26.162
gets a 25 percent discount
on all their dry cleanin'.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.699
10. 20.

19:28.767 --> 19:29.966
15. Deal.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.479
? 2 for tea

19:42.546 --> 19:45.582
? and tea for 2

19:45.650 --> 19:47.450
? you for me

19:47.518 --> 19:50.087
? and me for you

19:50.154 --> 19:52.589
you are screwin' up the words to that.

19:52.657 --> 19:54.357
? Can't you see, I'm happy

19:54.425 --> 19:57.761
don't go on with it, will you?

19:57.829 --> 20:00.731
You'll be singing and the neighbors'll
think I'm killin' you in here.

20:00.798 --> 20:02.232
[Doorbell ringing]

20:02.299 --> 20:04.534
That could be the worried neighbors now.

20:04.602 --> 20:06.636
Hey, arch, Mr. Jefferson wants to see you.

20:06.704 --> 20:08.606
Yeah, yeah. Dinner, dinner, dinner.

20:08.673 --> 20:10.107
Yeah, yeah.

20:10.942 --> 20:13.110
Oh, look at this.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.879
The boss is deliverin'
the cleanin' in person.

20:15.947 --> 20:17.081
That's something new.

20:17.148 --> 20:19.116
Yeah, I figured I'd
deliver that personally.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.819
Here's your bill. That's
$4.75 for the cleaning.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.154
That's the regular price, Jefferson.

20:24.222 --> 20:27.224
And look at this here. You
didn't fix the hole in that.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.858
We had a deal. What happened?

20:28.926 --> 20:31.061
Your signature bounced.
That's what happened.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.963
How could a signature bounce?

20:34.031 --> 20:35.866
Because you're not a registered republican.

20:35.933 --> 20:37.434
You're not a registered anything.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.969
When's the last time you voted, bunker?

20:39.037 --> 20:41.305
It's against the law for
you to ask me that.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.674
Well, anyway, thanks for
your phony signature.

20:43.741 --> 20:46.443
With it, we were able to obtain 25 more,

20:46.510 --> 20:48.278
which is more than we needed.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.946
Well, so I done you some good.

20:50.014 --> 20:51.949
So what about the family discount?

20:52.016 --> 20:54.251
That's only for registered Republicans.

20:54.318 --> 20:56.653
Listen to this.

20:56.721 --> 20:58.588
Yeah, pop, mom says dinner's ready.

20:58.656 --> 21:00.491
Ok, son.

21:00.558 --> 21:02.626
Oh, listen, Mr. bunker, I want to
thank you for signing that petition.

21:02.693 --> 21:04.862
You're gonna get a good man
representing the neighborhood.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.696
Oh, Lionel, I got news for you.

21:06.764 --> 21:08.999
The only thing your old man
is gonna represent good

21:09.067 --> 21:11.068
is his own personal cash register.

21:11.135 --> 21:12.169
Come on, let's go.

21:12.236 --> 21:13.703
What's that supposed to mean?

21:13.771 --> 21:16.039
Oh, don't tell me you don't
know the real reason

21:16.107 --> 21:18.809
that he wants to get on that
republican county committee?

21:18.876 --> 21:20.510
Come on, dinner's waiting.

21:20.578 --> 21:23.279
Well, he wants to do some good for the neighborhood.
What's wrong with that?

21:23.347 --> 21:25.815
I think the kid really believes that.

21:25.883 --> 21:28.185
Hey, meathead, we need your help over here.

21:28.252 --> 21:29.819
Come on over here.

21:29.887 --> 21:33.323
You're Lionel's friend. Tell him the truth.
Let him down easy.

21:33.391 --> 21:35.025
Yeah, well,

21:35.093 --> 21:36.460
uh, Lionel, I,

21:37.695 --> 21:39.062
I hate to say this, but

21:39.130 --> 21:41.364
the only reason your father
wants to get on that committee

21:41.432 --> 21:42.900
is so he can change the zoning law

21:42.967 --> 21:45.302
and break through the flower
shop and expand his store.

21:45.369 --> 21:47.537
Come on, Lionel, we don't want
to keep your mother waiting.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.840
Well, not completely 'cause,
even if he does get elected,

21:49.907 --> 21:52.509
he can't change the zoning law.
Not for the flower shop.

21:52.577 --> 21:53.443
Why not?

21:53.511 --> 21:55.312
Well, see he's running in the 32nd district

21:55.379 --> 21:57.314
and the flower shop's in the 33rd.

22:03.821 --> 22:05.622
Is that a fact, Lionel?

22:05.689 --> 22:06.923
Sure.

22:06.925 --> 22:09.759
Gee, that's an awful kick
in the head, Jefferson.

22:09.827 --> 22:11.928
Well, how could that be
if it's right next door?

22:12.163 --> 22:13.497
Well, see it's right on the boundary line.

22:13.564 --> 22:15.531
That's why the florist
couldn't sign the petition.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.300
Who the hell drew a boundary
line around my store?

22:17.368 --> 22:19.603
What are they trying to
do, segregate us again?

22:19.670 --> 22:21.304
Oh, so you didn't know, right?

22:21.372 --> 22:23.240
No, I didn't know. If I had known,

22:23.307 --> 22:25.742
I wouldn't wasting all my friendliness
on him and his old, ugly friends.

22:25.809 --> 22:28.177
Oh, so, then this whole thing was
just to make a buck, right, pop?

22:28.245 --> 22:29.913
Don't take it too hard, Lionel. After all,

22:29.980 --> 22:32.282
he deeply disappointed me, too.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.883
What's wrong with makin' a buck?

22:33.951 --> 22:35.385
Nothing, but this is me, pop.

22:35.453 --> 22:37.287
And why you gotta hide it from me, man?

22:37.355 --> 22:39.523
You know, I was all proud
you goin' into politics,

22:39.590 --> 22:41.558
but I never thought you'd
wind up to be a politician.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.293
Look, I did it for you.

22:50.034 --> 22:52.569
When I die, you're the one that's
gonna inherit the business.

22:52.636 --> 22:55.238
Unless you die first.

22:55.306 --> 22:57.607
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about our deal?

22:57.675 --> 23:00.210
We shook hands. Ain't
your handshake no good?

23:00.278 --> 23:02.445
Sure. It's just as good as your signature.

23:12.023 --> 23:14.357
That's a very crooked guy
just walked out of here.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.460
Oh, look who's callin' the kettle black.

23:16.527 --> 23:18.027
Oh, cut that stuff out.

23:18.095 --> 23:19.996
I wasn't making no references

23:20.064 --> 23:22.699
to race or color or breed.

23:25.436 --> 23:28.771
I'd call him crooked if
he was as white as you.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.207
Yeah, right.

23:30.274 --> 23:32.442
(Edith) Comin' through.

23:42.086 --> 23:43.820
What the hell?

24:10.514 --> 24:12.649
