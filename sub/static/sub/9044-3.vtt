WEBVTT

00:03.167 --> 00:04.900
- ROBERT, LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.433
- OKAY.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.467
- I SAID, LET'S GO!

00:07.467 --> 00:09.400
- I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.533
WHAT ARE WE,
LIKE A FREAKIN' HERD?

00:18.600 --> 00:19.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:19.667 --> 00:21.533
- YOU GOT TO GO.
EVERYBODY'S GOING, MAN.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.900
JUST GET OUT.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.133
- WHAT'S THE HURRY?

00:25.133 --> 00:29.900
- I'M GONNA HAVE SEX.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.167
- SINCE WHEN?

00:33.167 --> 00:35.100
- ALL THE PIECES
ARE IN PLACE.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.400
THE KIDS ARE AT A SLEEP-OVER,

00:36.400 --> 00:38.167
DEBRA HAD A GLASS
AND A HALF OF WINE,

00:38.167 --> 00:41.300
AND THIS MORNING,
I SAW HER SHAVING HER LEGS.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.833
- I CAN'T EVEN HAVE A DRINK?

00:47.833 --> 00:49.400
- COME--DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:49.400 --> 00:52.067
I'M DEALING
WITH A VERY DELICATE MOOD HERE.

00:52.067 --> 00:54.567
IT'S LIKE A JUGGLER
ON A TIGHTROPE.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.533
THE SLIGHTEST VIBRATION
ON THAT WIRE,

00:57.533 --> 01:00.267
DEAD JUGGLER.

01:00.267 --> 01:02.367
SO NO, YOU'RE NOT
BLOWING THIS FOR ME, MAN.

01:02.367 --> 01:04.300
GET OUT.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.333
- I HOPE I'M HAVING SEX ONE DAY
WHEN YOU NEED A DRINK.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.733
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GO.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.667
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA HAVE A DRINK FIRST.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.967
- I'LL JUST GET SOMETHING
OUT OF DAD'S LIQUOR CABINET.

01:16.967 --> 01:20.700
- THE HELL YOU WILL!

01:20.700 --> 01:23.133
- BACK TO THE PARTY.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.667
- OH, DEBRA, I'D LIKE
TO TAKE THE BOYS

01:24.667 --> 01:27.133
TO THAT HAPPY ZONE TOMORROW
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.967
- OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
THANK YOU, MARIE.

01:28.967 --> 01:30.600
- IT'S MY PLEASURE, DEAR.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.833
AND WHILE WE'RE OUT,
I'LL JUST GET THEM HAIRCUTS.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.867
OKAY, BYE.
- NO, WAIT!

01:35.867 --> 01:37.100
MARIE, THEY DON'T NEED HAIRCUTS.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.500
- OH, THEY BUT THEY DO.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.067
OH, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

01:40.067 --> 01:44.700
BUT THE BOYS LOOK A LITTLE
SLOVENLY LATELY.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.600
- EXCUSE ME?

01:46.600 --> 01:48.267
- OH, NO.

01:55.767 --> 01:59.100
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, MARIE,
THAT MY KIDS LOOK LIKE HOBOS?

01:59.100 --> 02:00.367
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

02:00.367 --> 02:02.567
- HA!
HEAVENS, NO!

02:02.567 --> 02:04.467
HOBOS HAVE BEARDS.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.300
- I HATE WHEN YOU
DO THIS, MARIE.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.633
- DO WHAT, DEAR?
HELP?

02:19.633 --> 02:20.867
- YEAH.
YEAH.

02:20.867 --> 02:22.600
THAT'S ALL SHE'S DOING.
SHE'S HELPING.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.867
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
YOU BIG HELPING MOMMY.

02:24.867 --> 02:25.933
- [laughs]

02:25.933 --> 02:26.933
- LOOK OUT.

02:26.933 --> 02:28.267
MARIE,

02:28.267 --> 02:31.300
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
BE DIRECT WITH ME?

02:31.300 --> 02:33.133
- WELL, I'M SORRY,

02:33.133 --> 02:34.767
BUT IT'S HARD
TO BE DIRECT WITH SOMEONE

02:34.767 --> 02:36.133
WHO JUMPS DOWN YOUR THROAT

02:36.133 --> 02:39.233
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE
A HELPFUL SUGGESTION.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.333
THERE.
IS THAT DIRECT ENOUGH?

02:53.700 --> 02:55.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MARIE?

02:55.067 --> 02:56.700
I'LL TAKE THE BOYS
TO THE HAPPY ZONE,

02:56.700 --> 02:58.367
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THEIR HAIRCUTS,

02:58.367 --> 03:00.167
AND I'LL DO IT ALL WITHOUT YOU.

03:00.167 --> 03:02.133
HOW IS THAT FOR DIRECT?

03:02.133 --> 03:03.867
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME, DEAR.

03:03.867 --> 03:06.967
AT LEAST YOU'RE FINALLY
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

03:06.967 --> 03:10.133
COME ON, ROBERT.
LET'S GO.

03:11.433 --> 03:13.800
- [sighs]
UNBELIEVABLE!

03:13.800 --> 03:16.567
[dishes clattering]

03:16.567 --> 03:19.333
- WELL, I'LL GET OUT
OF YOUR WAY.

03:19.333 --> 03:23.767
I--

03:23.767 --> 03:27.567
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT
A JUGGLER TO BURY.

03:38.467 --> 03:40.400
- HOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER, HUH?

03:40.400 --> 03:45.000
HOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.900
- I KNOW.
SHE'S TERRIBLE.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.000
- [gargling loudly]

04:11.767 --> 04:13.600
[sighing]

04:26.933 --> 04:30.233
- NIGHTY-NIGHT.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.033
- I CAN'T SLEEP.

04:32.033 --> 04:33.833
[breathing heavily]
I'M SEETHING!

04:33.833 --> 04:36.767
SHE ACTUALLY
HAS ME SEETHING!

04:36.767 --> 04:38.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:38.167 --> 04:40.167
YOU SHOULDN'T LET HER
RUIN YOUR EVENING.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.200
AND PROBABLY THE BEST WAY
TO GET EVEN WITH HER

04:42.200 --> 04:45.767
IS TO JUST DO
WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED,

04:45.767 --> 04:47.267
YOU KNOW?

04:47.267 --> 04:49.767
I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE,
IF YOU WERE GONNA WATCH TV,

04:49.767 --> 04:51.200
THEN JUST WATCH TV.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.733
OR IF YOU WERE
GONNA DO SOMETHING,

04:53.733 --> 04:55.333
I DON'T KNOW...

04:58.200 --> 05:01.667
INTERACTIVE?

05:01.667 --> 05:02.567
- WHAT?

05:02.567 --> 05:04.733
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HAVE SEX NOW?

05:04.733 --> 05:06.000
- NO!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.933
NO, NO,
I'M JUST BRAINSTORMING.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.867
- YEAH.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.167
FORGET IT.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.900
YOUR MOTHER'S
RUINED THE WHOLE NIGHT,

05:13.900 --> 05:16.700
JUST LIKE SHE'S RUINED
EVERY OTHER NIGHT!

05:16.700 --> 05:19.633
[sighing]

05:23.333 --> 05:25.133
OH, WHAT THE HELL.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.333
- OH, SEE?

05:34.333 --> 05:35.833
HE WAS ALREADY
WARMING UP IN THE BULLPEN,

05:35.833 --> 05:37.533
SO WHY'S HE GOT TO DO IT AGAIN
ON THE MOUND?

05:37.533 --> 05:39.500
THAT'S WHY THE GAME
TAKES SO LONG.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.300
- THEN PUT ON
THAT SPANISH GAME SHOW

05:41.300 --> 05:43.967
WITH THE HOT CHICAS
RUNNING AROUND ALL CRAZY.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.200
- OH, SI!
QUE LOCA, LOCA, LOCA!

05:46.200 --> 05:47.633
- YI YI YI YI YI YI!

05:47.633 --> 05:48.767
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

05:48.767 --> 05:52.467
JUST LEAVE THE GAME ON,
YOU SEX-STARVED ANIMALS.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.567
- OH.

05:54.567 --> 05:55.667
FIRST OF ALL,

05:55.667 --> 05:57.033
I'LL PUT ON
ANY CHANNEL I WANT,

05:57.033 --> 05:58.600
'CAUSE THIS IS MY HOUSE,

05:58.600 --> 06:01.200
AND YOU'RE JUST HERE
TO MAKE US SEEM GOOD-LOOKING.

06:05.167 --> 06:06.600
SECOND OF ALL,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.500
IF YOU KNEW WHAT WENT ON
IN THIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT,

06:08.500 --> 06:09.967
THE LAST THING
YOU'D BE CALLING ME

06:09.967 --> 06:12.333
IS "SEX-STARVED," MY FRIEND.

06:17.667 --> 06:22.267
DOES THE TERM "ANGRY SEX"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

06:22.267 --> 06:24.233
- OH, YEAH.
- [chuckles]

06:24.233 --> 06:25.667
- YOU MEAN LIKE
WHEN THE WIFE GETS ANGRY

06:25.667 --> 06:31.400
'CAUSE WE WRAP IT UP
A LITTLE TOO SOON?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.633
- NO.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.233
- HEY, WHAT IS SHE MAD
AT YOU FOR?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.867
- SHE WASN'T MAD AT ME.
SHE WAS MAD AT MY MOTHER.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.167
AND I DON'T KNOW,

06:45.167 --> 06:47.900
IT JUST FREED UP
SOMETHING IN HER,

06:47.900 --> 06:51.367
AND SHE CHANNELED THAT ANGER

06:51.367 --> 06:55.200
IN A VERY HOT FASHION.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.367
- DID SHE CURSE?

07:01.367 --> 07:03.333
- SHE SAID SOME THINGS, MAN.
SHE SAID SOME THINGS.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.767
- OH!
- COME ON!

07:04.767 --> 07:08.033
- ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.067
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.667
- THAT'S DISGUSTING,

07:17.667 --> 07:20.333
TALKING ABOUT YOUR WIFE
LIKE THAT TO THESE CREEPS.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.633
- WHAT?

07:21.633 --> 07:23.033
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS,
ALL RIGHT?

07:23.033 --> 07:27.533
SO MIND YOUR OWN
FAT-ASS BUSINESS.

07:27.533 --> 07:28.833
- YEAH.

07:28.833 --> 07:32.000
- YEAH.
SHUT UP.

07:33.867 --> 07:38.500
- MY REAR END IS
APPROPRIATELY PROPORTIONED...

07:42.900 --> 07:44.300
RAYMOND.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.600
AND I'D LIKE TO SAY
SOMETHING ELSE.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.267
EXPLOITING SOMEONE'S ANGER
FOR YOUR OWN GRATIFICATION

07:49.267 --> 07:50.633
IS REPUGNANT.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.800
AND DOUBLE REPUGNANT

07:51.800 --> 07:56.467
IS THEN BRAGGING
TO YOUR MONKEY PALS ABOUT IT.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.667
THE DEEPEST FORM OF INTIMACY
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN

07:58.667 --> 08:03.167
SHOULD BE A PRIVATE THING
AND REMAIN SACRED.

08:10.467 --> 08:11.867
- HI.
WE'RE BACK.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.267
- OH, HEY.
WHY SO SOON?

08:13.267 --> 08:14.533
WHAT, DID YOU RUN OUT OF MONEY,

08:14.533 --> 08:17.633
OR DID THE MALL
RUN OUT OF STUFF?

08:17.633 --> 08:19.200
- I JUST DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE SHOPPING.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.300
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW, AMY.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.433
- OKAY.
NIGHT.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.700
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.667
- GOOD NIGHT.
- WELL--

08:24.667 --> 08:26.833
- [sighs]

08:26.833 --> 08:29.567
[door slams]

08:29.567 --> 08:30.567
- NOW WHAT?

08:30.567 --> 08:31.933
- OH, RAY,
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.300
WE WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.100
AND THEN I BROUGHT UP
THIS WHOLE MARIE THING,

08:35.100 --> 08:36.667
YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING
TO HELP WORK IT OUT,

08:36.667 --> 08:41.433
AND WHAT--WELL, SHE JUST GOT
ANGRIER AND ANGRIER.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.533
- DID SHE CURSE?

08:52.533 --> 08:53.567
- WHAT?

08:53.567 --> 08:55.033
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, AMY, YOU TRIED.

08:55.033 --> 08:56.433
YOU TRIED, OKAY?

08:56.433 --> 08:58.200
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

08:58.200 --> 09:03.767
SO, GUYS, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO TEND TO MY WIFE.

09:03.767 --> 09:05.833
- OF COURSE, RAYMOND.
KEEP US INFORMED.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.400
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.500
OKAY.

09:08.500 --> 09:13.900
- OH, YOU ARE GOING
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.700
- AND YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO LIVE WITH MOMMY AND DADDY.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.200
- YOU WIN.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.467
OH, BUT ONE OTHER THING,
RAYMOND.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.800
A MAN WITHOUT RESPECT
FOR THE SANCTITY OF LOVE

09:34.800 --> 09:37.200
IS A SOULLESS MAN.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.600
- YOU ARE A VERY BIG GIRL.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.433
- OH, RAYMOND?

09:51.433 --> 09:52.767
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HOME.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.400
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:54.400 --> 09:55.967
- LISTEN, I NEED TO TALK
TO DEBRA.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.333
- OH, YEAH.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.067
WELL, NOW'S A BAD TIME,
SO MAYBE TOMORROW.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.667
- NO.
NO, RAYMOND, LISTEN, LISTEN.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.767
I SAW THAT TALK SHOW TODAY
WITH THE FOUR LADIES...

10:03.767 --> 10:05.133
- YEAH?

10:05.133 --> 10:06.667
- AND THEY HAD
THIS RELATIONSHIP DOCTOR ON

10:06.667 --> 10:10.133
WHO SAID, "EVERY TIME
YOU LEAVE A FAMILY MEMBER,

10:10.133 --> 10:12.133
"YOU MUST TREAT THAT PERSON

10:12.133 --> 10:15.467
AS IF YOU'LL
NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN."

10:15.467 --> 10:17.100
- I LOVE YOU, MOM.
GOOD-BYE.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.067
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.667
THAT GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT DEBRA,

10:21.667 --> 10:24.233
AND THEN THERE WAS
THIS COMMERCIAL

10:24.233 --> 10:26.533
ABOUT HOUSEHOLD BACTERIA,

10:26.533 --> 10:30.067
AND THAT REALLY GOT ME
THINKING ABOUT HER.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.400
AND THEN I SAID TO MYSELF,

10:31.400 --> 10:34.400
"THIS CAN'T BE
JUST COINCIDENTAL."

10:34.400 --> 10:35.533
NO.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.467
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
RIGHT NOW, RAYMOND.

10:38.467 --> 10:40.633
- OH, THAT'S NICE, MA,
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

10:40.633 --> 10:43.533
SHE'S SLEEPING.
SHE'S ACTUALLY SICK.

10:43.533 --> 10:44.967
- SHE'S SICK?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:44.967 --> 10:45.967
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.433
"YOU DON'T WAKE THE SICK

10:47.433 --> 10:49.333
UNLESS YOU FORGOT
TO TAKE THE THERMOMETER OUT."

10:49.333 --> 10:51.433
SO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD--

10:51.433 --> 10:53.233
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GO NOW.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.900
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.100
LET ME LEAVE THIS HERE.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.400
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
PUT IT IN THERE.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.733
- YEAH, AND, OH, RAYMOND,

10:58.733 --> 11:01.567
PLEASE TELL HER
THAT I WANT TO TALK TO HER

11:01.567 --> 11:04.667
AND APOLOGIZE LIKE THAT TV SHOW
WITH THE LADIES.

11:04.667 --> 11:05.667
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.667
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.667
I WILL, MOM.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.833
- OH, AND, RAYMOND,

11:08.833 --> 11:10.667
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT THERMOMETERS,

11:10.667 --> 11:12.233
ESPECIALLY
THE OLD-FASHIONED KIND.

11:12.233 --> 11:13.467
- I KNOW.
I KNOW, MA.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.933
- WE HAD THIS PROBLEM
WITH ROBBIE,

11:14.933 --> 11:15.933
'CAUSE HE HAS A BIG BOTTOM.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.500
- OKAY.
I KNOW.

11:24.367 --> 11:27.200
HEY, HEY.
YOU STILL UP?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.167
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
RUNNING AROUND FOR?

11:29.167 --> 11:30.400
- OH, NO.
NO.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.833
NO, I WASN'T RUNNING.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.733
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO PRETEND
I'M A COUGAR.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.233
YEAH.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.833
- I STILL CAN'T SLEEP

11:40.833 --> 11:42.700
'CAUSE OF THIS THING
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.700
- OH, MAN, THAT STINKS.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.700
WELL, CAN I HELP?

11:44.700 --> 11:48.133
ARE YOU THIRSTY?
YOU WANT SOME WINE?

11:48.133 --> 11:49.933
- YOU KNOW,
SHE JUST SETS ME OFF,

11:49.933 --> 11:50.933
AND THEN SHE LEAVES.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.167
BUT IT STAYS WITH ME,

11:52.167 --> 11:54.233
AND I JUST GET
ANGRIER AND ANGRIER.

11:54.233 --> 11:56.133
- HUH, WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING YOU COULD DO

11:56.133 --> 11:57.133
TO RELIEVE THE TENSION.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.333
WHAT COULD IT BE?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.767
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:00.767 --> 12:02.233
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

12:02.233 --> 12:03.433
- OH!
WHAT?

12:03.433 --> 12:04.633
- YEAH.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.333
I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS
THIS WAY, YOU KNOW?

12:06.333 --> 12:07.567
THE SOONER I ACCEPT THE BLAME,

12:07.567 --> 12:09.267
THE SOONER ALL THIS
WILL GO AWAY,

12:09.267 --> 12:11.233
AND IT'LL BE BETTER
FOR EVERYBODY.

12:11.233 --> 12:12.800
- YEAH?
REALLY?

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
- YEAH.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.967
YOU DON'T NEED ME

12:14.967 --> 12:16.633
BROODING AROUND HERE
ALL WEEK.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.300
- HEY, I'M THE LAST PERSON
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.567
BUT, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD GO APOLOGIZE.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.033
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.
YES.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.533
IN FACT, I HEARD
SHE'S SITTING OVER THERE

12:22.533 --> 12:25.167
WAITING FOR YOU TO APOLOGIZE.

12:28.567 --> 12:30.633
- WHAT?

12:30.633 --> 12:33.267
- WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE
SHE KNOWS YOU ALWAYS DO

12:33.267 --> 12:34.967
NO MATTER HOW WRONG SHE IS.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.633
BUT, UH, NO.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:36.633 --> 12:39.700
YOU SHOULDN'T LET HER HAPPINESS
GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR DIGNITY.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.267
- OH, DAMN HER!

12:42.267 --> 12:43.600
I'M NOT GOING OVER THERE!

12:43.600 --> 12:45.100
- WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT IS THIS?

12:45.100 --> 12:46.733
- IF SHE THINKS
I'M COMING OVER THERE,

12:46.733 --> 12:49.367
SHE CAN SIT THERE ALL SMUG
TILL HELL FREEZES OVER!

12:49.367 --> 12:52.633
- WHOA!
THIS IS A COMPLETE TURNAROUND.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.533
- GREAT, NOW I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SLEEP AGAIN.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.467
SHE IS KILLING ME!
YOUR MOTHER'S KILLING ME!

12:56.467 --> 12:58.500
- WELL, HERE, HERE.
I HATE SEEING YOU LIKE THIS.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.900
I REALLY DO.
HERE, JUST RELAX.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.733
RELAX.
YEAH. YEAH.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.367
- [scoffs]

13:04.367 --> 13:06.167
[sighs]

13:10.433 --> 13:13.400
- OW!
- OOH, DID I BITE YOU?

13:13.400 --> 13:16.000
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU DID.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.033
- GOOD MORNING, RAYMOND.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.000
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.233
- HOW'S DEBRA FEELING?

13:38.233 --> 13:40.667
- OH, YEAH.
NO.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.033
STILL SICK, YEAH.

13:42.033 --> 13:44.733
I THINK IT'S LIKE
A THREE-DAY THING SHE'S GOT.

13:44.733 --> 13:47.333
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE BEGINNING OF DAY TWO,

13:47.333 --> 13:52.067
SO MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU
ON DAY FOUR.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.300
- WELL, SHE MUST BE VERY SICK,
'CAUSE SHE CAN'T EVEN

13:54.300 --> 13:57.000
PICK UP A PHONE
TO THANK ME FOR APOLOGIZING.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
- WHAT?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.433
- WELL, YOU TOLD HER

13:59.433 --> 14:02.167
I WAS APOLOGIZING LAST NIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

14:02.167 --> 14:04.433
- OF COURSE, YEAH.
YES.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.033
IT'S JUST, SHE'S SO SICK,

14:06.033 --> 14:08.100
SHE FELL ASLEEP
RIGHT AFTER I TOLD HER.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.767
- OH, WELL, SHE'S THAT SICK?
- YEAH.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.267
- WELL, MAYBE
I SHOULD CHECK ON HER.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.900
WHERE IS SHE?
- NO, NO, NO, NO, MA.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.767
YOU SHOULDN'T GO,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SUSCEPTIBLE.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.467
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:
"CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY."

14:18.467 --> 14:20.067
IT JUST--
IT AFFECTS THEM MORE,

14:20.067 --> 14:21.967
AND WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

14:21.967 --> 14:25.667
YOU ARE GETTING
A LITTLE ELDERLY.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.767
- HEY.
- HEY.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.200
- WE'RE GOING
TO THE FLEA MARKET.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.433
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME WITH US?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.067
- OH, WE CAN'T.
DEBRA'S SICK.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.833
- REALLY?
OH, SHE WAS FINE YESTERDAY.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.433
- YEAH, WELL, YESTERDAY.

14:35.433 --> 14:38.533
IF WE COULD ALL GO BACK.
YEAH.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.500
- RAYMOND TOLD ME
SHE WAS SO SICK LAST NIGHT,

14:40.500 --> 14:42.367
HE WOULDN'T EVEN
LET ME SEE HER.

14:42.367 --> 14:46.533
- OH, YOU MUST'VE BEEN TENDING
TO HER, RIGHT, RAYMOND?

14:52.533 --> 14:53.667
- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.400
- MARIE, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU RUNNING TO?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.100
I DIDN'T EVEN
GET BREAKFAST!

14:57.100 --> 14:58.433
- SO RAY?

14:58.433 --> 15:01.900
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS--

15:01.900 --> 15:03.067
OH.

15:03.067 --> 15:06.100
- DEBRA, YOU LOOK WELL.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.367
- THANK YOU.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.967
- BUT SHOULDN'T YOU
BE IN BED?

15:08.967 --> 15:10.267
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:10.267 --> 15:11.733
- RAYMOND SAID YOU'RE SICK.

15:11.733 --> 15:13.867
- SHE WAS.
YOU ARE.

15:13.867 --> 15:16.833
LAST NIGHT, WHEN I KISSED
YOUR HEAD, YOU HAD A FEVER.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.067
IN FACT,
YOU COULD BE DELIRIOUS.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.333
THIS COULD ALL BE A DREAM.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.033
YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO BED
RIGHT NOW.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.867
- HEY, NOBODY TOLD ME
THERE WAS CAKE.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.600
- I BROUGHT IT OVER LAST NIGHT.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.000
- YOU WERE OVER HERE
LAST NIGHT?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.033
- MM-HMM.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.267
- WELL, HEY!
ALL RIGHT!

15:32.267 --> 15:33.767
WELL, LET'S HAVE
SOME OF THAT CAKE!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.100
LET'S HAVE SOME CAKE.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
- I CAME OVER TO APOLOGIZE.
I TOLD RAYMOND.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.400
- WHAT?

15:39.400 --> 15:44.333
- WELL, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.333
- I WASN'T SARCASTIC.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.967
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT BACTERIA COMMERCIAL.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.800
AND I WAS VERY SINCERE.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.733
I EVEN MADE DEBRA A CAKE
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

15:53.733 --> 15:58.400
- WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THAT.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.200
- SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

16:00.200 --> 16:02.767
- WELL, LOOK,
I VAGUELY REMEMBER--

16:02.767 --> 16:06.400
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT DEBRA,
BUT AS FAR AS AN APOLOGY--

16:06.400 --> 16:08.233
LOOK, IT CERTAINLY
WASN'T CLEAR--

16:08.233 --> 16:09.600
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.433
LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

16:11.433 --> 16:12.667
LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.700
LET'S ALL HAVE SOME CAKE

16:13.700 --> 16:17.067
THAT SAYS,
"I'M SORRY" ON IT.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.133
- THAT'S A GREAT CAKE, MA.

16:23.133 --> 16:26.367
CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE RAYMOND EAT IT.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.067
- IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY, RAY?

16:43.767 --> 16:47.967
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL DEBRA
THAT I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE?

16:47.967 --> 16:49.333
- HONESTLY, FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.300
- OKAY, DEBRA,
YOU JUST WEREN'T READY

16:51.300 --> 16:54.133
TO RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.433
SOMETIMES IN LIFE,

16:55.433 --> 16:57.000
THINGS GOT TO GET A LOT WORSE

16:57.000 --> 16:59.133
BEFORE THEY GET BETTER.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.000
IT'S JUST LIKE SHOES!

17:01.000 --> 17:03.700
SOMETIMES WHEN THEY'RE NEW,
THEY'RE NOT SO COMFORTABLE,

17:03.700 --> 17:07.600
BUT WHEN YOU BEAT 'EM UP
A LITTLE, THEN THEY'RE GREAT.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.267
THIS IS LIKE NOW.

17:10.267 --> 17:13.567
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE, RAYMOND.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.267
- NOT TO YOU,
BECAUSE YOU BUY YOUR SHOES

17:15.267 --> 17:21.133
AT THE SAME PLACE
YOU GET YOUR WIDE-LOAD PANTS.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.367
- WAIT A MINUTE.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.133
- NO, THIS FAMILY
CAN'T WAIT, AMY!

17:25.133 --> 17:26.467
[stammering]

17:26.467 --> 17:28.800
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT MY METHOD WAS?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.533
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW!

17:31.533 --> 17:32.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.033
THAT'S WHAT
THE CAKE SHOULD SAY:

17:34.033 --> 17:35.833
"EVERYBODY'S FINE"!

17:35.833 --> 17:37.567
- OOH!

17:51.400 --> 17:56.533
- SO MARIE, YOU CAME OVER
TO APOLOGIZE LAST NIGHT?

17:56.533 --> 17:57.700
- I DID.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.533
AND I LEARNED
FROM THE FOUR LADIES

17:59.533 --> 18:02.233
THAT NOTHING IS WORTH
FIGHTING OVER THIS WAY.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.233
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.767
IF I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

18:04.767 --> 18:07.100
I SHOULD JUST COME OUT WITH IT
OR KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.367
- YOUR MOUTH?

18:08.367 --> 18:10.100
THAT'S LIKE TRYING
TO HOLD BACK A--

18:10.100 --> 18:13.233
[choking]

18:14.900 --> 18:17.800
I'M SORRY.
I WAS EATING.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.733
SET ME UP AGAIN.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.500
- WOW, MARIE, THAT'S--

18:30.500 --> 18:32.967
WOW!
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

18:32.967 --> 18:34.900
I'M SO SURPRISED.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
THANK YOU.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.733
- YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.433
EVERYBODY, LET US EAT CAKE.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.567
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE, RAY.

18:41.567 --> 18:44.567
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE CAME OVER TO APOLOGIZE,

18:44.567 --> 18:48.200
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNEW
HOW ANGRY I WAS?

18:50.200 --> 18:52.400
- HOLD ON TO SOMETHING.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.733
- I TOLD YOU, YOU WEREN'T READY
TO RECEIVE IT.

19:02.733 --> 19:05.233
I NEEDED TO CALM YOU DOWN.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.433
- OH, YOU NEEDED
TO CALM ME DOWN.

19:06.433 --> 19:08.567
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU NEEDED--

19:16.867 --> 19:20.367
OH, MY GOD.

19:20.367 --> 19:24.467
YOU'RE LIKE A SEX MANIAC!

19:24.467 --> 19:26.133
- WHAT?

19:26.133 --> 19:30.100
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

19:30.100 --> 19:34.200
- HE DIDN'T TELL DEBRA
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET SEX?

19:34.200 --> 19:38.000
- EVIL SEX.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.200
EVIL, TWISTED, DIRTY SEX.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.000
- NO, NO.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.533
- I'M DISAPPOINTED, RAYMOND.

19:45.533 --> 19:49.333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO THINK
OF YOUR MOTHER BEFORE SEX.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.833
- OH.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.833
I KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.500
THE ACTION IS ALWAYS BETTER

19:59.500 --> 20:01.600
WHEN THERE'S A LITTLE FIRE
IN THE FURNACE, RIGHT, RAY?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.933
- NO! NO. NO.
THAT IS SO WRONG.

20:03.933 --> 20:08.867
CRAZY OLD MAN!

20:08.867 --> 20:10.300
- COME ON!

20:10.300 --> 20:11.967
WHY DO YOU THINK I GIVE THIS ONE
SUCH A HARD TIME?

20:11.967 --> 20:15.500
WHEN SHE'S STEAMED UP,
EVERYTHING'S BETTER.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.400
I'LL TELL YOU,
THE ANGRY SEX IS GOOD,

20:18.400 --> 20:23.667
BUT WHAT I REALLY LOVE
IS THE ANGRY STEAK PIZZAIOLA.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.367
- YOU'RE A PIG!

20:25.367 --> 20:26.233
- GOOD!

20:26.233 --> 20:27.700
USE THAT
FOR THE LASAGNA TONIGHT.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.933
- OH.

20:29.933 --> 20:31.900
- LOOK, DEBRA.
THIS--

20:31.900 --> 20:33.333
[sighs]

20:36.000 --> 20:37.567
- I TOLD HIM, MA.

20:37.567 --> 20:41.667
YOU MUST ALWAYS BE SENSITIVE
TO YOUR WIFE'S EMOTIONS.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.900
- YOU, MY BOY,

20:43.900 --> 20:47.167
ARE A GIRL.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.500
- ALL RIGHT.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.900
YOU WOULDN'T TALK
TO ME THIS MORNING,

20:57.900 --> 20:59.567
YOU WOULDN'T TALK
TO ME THIS AFTERNOON,

20:59.567 --> 21:01.333
AND YOU WOULDN'T TALK
TO ME TONIGHT.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.433
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO GET OFF MY CHEST,

21:03.433 --> 21:05.400
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU WANT TO HEAR IT OR NOT,

21:05.400 --> 21:07.600
BECAUSE I AM GONNA SAY IT.

21:07.600 --> 21:13.600
YES, I MAY HAVE USED YOUR ANGER
IN A PLEASURABLE WAY.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.033
BUT THAT PLEASURE
WAS NOT JUST MY OWN.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.033
HUH?

21:18.033 --> 21:19.233
SO IF I USE YOU,

21:19.233 --> 21:22.133
YOU USE ME RIGHT BACK, LADY.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.400
ADMIT IT.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.400
IT WAS LIKE THERAPY FOR YOU.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.967
YOU USED ME
LIKE I WAS YOUR THERAPIST,

21:27.967 --> 21:32.667
YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

21:32.667 --> 21:36.300
SO BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME,
YOU LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR

21:36.300 --> 21:38.133
WITHOUT THE MAKEUP ON.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.333
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.967
AND YOU ASK YOURSELF,

21:40.967 --> 21:42.933
"ISN'T THIS WHAT MARRIAGE IS,

21:42.933 --> 21:45.833
THE MUTUAL USING OF EACH OTHER?"

21:45.833 --> 21:47.233
I THINK SO!

21:47.233 --> 21:48.567
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

21:48.567 --> 21:51.433
WE WILL GET PAST
THIS UNPLEASANTNESS AS A COUPLE

21:51.433 --> 21:54.700
IF YOU WILL LET ME
SLEEP HERE TOMORROW.
