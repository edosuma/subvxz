00:45.045 --> 00:50.758
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey...

00:51.301 --> 00:55.054
So hot. So sticky.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.852
Marge?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.437
I'm back here.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.654
Ah, the old folks. It
happens every heat wave.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.198
Okay, people, out of my freezer!

01:15.451 --> 01:17.285
But we're hot and elderly!

01:17.369 --> 01:20.413
I'm sorry, these are reserved
for the recently deceased.

01:20.873 --> 01:21.914
Hmm.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.708
Don't you go too far.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.257
This air conditioning is
better than any truant officer.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.760
I'm seeing students I
haven't seen in years.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.184
Mrs. K.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.186
Oh, Arthur.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.784
We're wasting more energy
than Ricky Martin's girlfriend.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.035
Hey-oh!

02:11.381 --> 02:15.718
Gentlemen, our city's sucking down
the juice like my wife at an open bar.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.929
Mr. Burns, can your plant handle it?

02:18.013 --> 02:18.971
No problem.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.224
We've siphoned off extra
power from the orphanage.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.893
Who are they going to
complain to? Their parents?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.062
But, sir, we're at full capacity.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.606
One more appliance could
overload the system.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.609
Fear not. Our town has dodged disaster,

02:31.693 --> 02:33.903
and I have come out smelling
like guest-room soap.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.039
You know what will cool this place down?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.583
A little touch of winter.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.880
Dad, no! We're trying
to conserve energy.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.884
Lisa, if we start conserving,
the environmentalists win!

03:03.684 --> 03:06.519
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell...

03:10.941 --> 03:11.941
Jingle bell what?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.276
Dad, it's a blackout.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.069
A blackout?

03:15.153 --> 03:18.072
Oh. Every time Santa and I
get together, it's a disaster.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.285
Oh, no, the power's out? We'll
miss Fox's Celebrity Boxing!

03:22.369 --> 03:25.621
I heard tonight they have
Ed Bradley versus Mister Ed.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.833
It's terrible, all the
traffic lights are out.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.209
Driving sure is dangerous.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.544
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.213
I got some yuppie jerkoff
headed right for me,

03:34.298 --> 03:36.090
yakking away on his cell phone.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.510
I hear that. I got some big
shot barreling down on me.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.054
Hey! Who are you talking
to? Your boyfriend?

03:42.139 --> 03:45.099
Hey, jackass! Your
voice sounds familiar!

03:51.398 --> 03:53.608
I don't hear an alarm. Let's take stuff.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.026
Whoa! Isn't that stealing?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.444
No, it's just looting.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.362
Sweet. Let's go nuts.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.157
Hot town, summer in the city

04:01.241 --> 04:04.076
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty

04:04.494 --> 04:06.412
Mannequins. You can't buy these!

04:06.496 --> 04:08.915
Oh! Look at all these tube socks!

04:08.999 --> 04:11.125
But at night it's a different world

04:11.209 --> 04:13.169
Go out and find a girl

04:13.253 --> 04:15.421
Come on, come on and dance all night

04:15.505 --> 04:17.380
Despite the heat it'll be all right

04:17.466 --> 04:19.466
And, babe, don't you know it's a pity

04:19.551 --> 04:22.595
That the days can't be like the nights

04:23.764 --> 04:24.972
Oh, crap!

04:38.195 --> 04:41.656
Kent, this city has exploded
in a fireball of pent-up rage!

04:41.740 --> 04:46.118
I think what the viewers want to
know, Arnie, is, is my house okay?

04:46.203 --> 04:49.205
You mean, is your
giant castle okay, Kent?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.749
Don't hate me because I bought
at the right time, Arnie.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.794
When's my right time,
Kent? When's my right time?

05:01.551 --> 05:04.011
Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!

05:04.096 --> 05:07.264
Ow! Ow!

05:08.892 --> 05:11.227
Finally, some repression.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.899
All right, everyone!
Disperse immediately!

05:17.192 --> 05:19.443
We are prepared to use force!

05:19.528 --> 05:21.570
What, what? We're not prepared, Eddie?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.241
Someone call 911.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.659
Oh, they never come.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.038
Thus ends the rule of law.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.417
Look at those looters breaking
windows, setting fires!

05:34.501 --> 05:37.336
They're living my dream, and
you won't let me join them!

05:37.421 --> 05:39.463
Please, can I throw one little...

05:39.548 --> 05:40.548
No.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.008
What if I just burn down a... No.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
Can I at least incite further... No.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.138
I've caused enough trouble already
by plugging in that Santa Claus.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.348
No more irresponsible behavior.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.474
Can I have a beer?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.101
All right. But not the imported.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.185
Homer?

05:53.270 --> 05:54.854
You've got to set limits, Marge.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.147
No beer!

06:05.323 --> 06:08.743
Get your T-shirts here! "I
survived the Springfield riot!"

06:11.121 --> 06:13.205
Remember me as a hero.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.961
The looters stole me glass eye!

06:21.006 --> 06:22.590
This be a superball.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.095
Back in my day, we had people
who stood up to ruffians.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.847
We called them men.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.516
I agree with the hideous crone!

06:32.601 --> 06:33.893
Yeah! Hear, hear!

06:33.977 --> 06:34.977
She's ugly!

06:35.062 --> 06:39.315
I think I speak for myself, Comic
Book Guy and Bumblebee Man when I say,

06:39.399 --> 06:40.900
I blame Chief Clancy Wiggum!

06:40.984 --> 06:42.985
Yeah! Yeah.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.739
You know, it's not just my fault. You
were the ones doing all the looting.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.116
Oh, sure. Blame the victims.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.035
Throw some Nikes at his head.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.328
What size?

06:52.412 --> 06:56.499
People, rest assured the police
department's ineptitude shall not stand.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.169
I am announcing the formation
of a blue-ribbon committee.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.421
A committee?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.131
Did he say blue-ribbon?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.258
Committees don't get
any better than that.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.676
Man, am I appeased.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.638
So, can we keep the stuff we stole?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.264
I think that's implied.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.477
I don't care what they say.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.022
I won't feel safe in this town
until we have better police.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.151
Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties
at Milhouse's birthday party.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.821
Dad...

07:26.905 --> 07:29.532
Oh! Seriously, everyone
says your parties rock.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.367
Homer, this is all your fault.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.577
If you hadn't plugged
in your dancing Santa,

07:33.662 --> 07:35.287
none of this would have happened.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.540
I admit it. I did screw up.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.960
But I won't feel guilty until
I can put a human face on this.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.503
Mom! Dad!

07:42.587 --> 07:45.005
Someone stole my
Malibu Stacy collection!

07:45.090 --> 07:47.550
Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.552
Yes, and she's crying.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.724
That's it! Nobody messes
with my little girl!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.393
I'm going to find those dolls!

07:58.436 --> 07:59.979
Are you gonna call the police?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.647
Oh! Forget it!

08:01.731 --> 08:07.069
They couldn't catch a cold
with a cold-catching thing.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.030
See, when you don't
use Milhouse, it's hard.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.032
I love this kid.

08:12.909 --> 08:17.329
Yes. Interesting. Okay.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.000
All right, I've come up with a
composite sketch of my prime suspect.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.084
Behold!

08:22.169 --> 08:23.502
Dad, that's Bart.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.254
Exactly.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.508
Look at him over there,
eating that apple.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.969
What's he planning? What?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.013
Maybe we should look for clues.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.139
You're right.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.101
What's this? A cap!

08:40.937 --> 08:43.105
From The Wooly Bully.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.443
Do you sell hats? Yeah.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.196
To people? People with
heads? Maybe. Sometimes.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.406
Dude, I need a new cap.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.453
Ah-ha! Did you steal
dolls from my daughter?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.041
I think they demean women!

09:02.125 --> 09:05.502
Well, think again, son.
You're going to juvie.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.671
But I just got out of juvie.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.132
Good! 'Cause I need directions.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.640
Well, you'll be happy to
know Malibu Stacy's fine.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.767
I really appreciate what you did, Dad.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.143
Aw.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.897
You said you'd do something
and you followed through on it.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.900
Hey, you know, stopping
criminals is fun.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.486
I felt like a big man
pushing that kid around!

09:33.448 --> 09:35.574
Yo, empty the register, dude.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.201
Okay, okay, you're the boss.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.913
Silent alarm activated!

09:40.997 --> 09:42.581
Oh! That's it!

09:45.835 --> 09:48.754
No cops in sight. If I'm
gonna save that clerk,

09:48.838 --> 09:51.507
I'm gonna have to take the
law into my own hands again.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.011
Cheese!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.972
That's muy picante!

10:00.308 --> 10:02.017
Homer, you are so brave.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.436
If anyone deserves to
take a penny, it is you.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.857
Well... Well, no.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.069
Come on, come on,
there's only one in there.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.697
You know, I've had a lot of jobs.

10:14.781 --> 10:19.159
Boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation
Krusty, baby-proofer, trucker,

10:19.244 --> 10:22.955
hippie, plow driver, food critic,
conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny,

10:23.039 --> 10:26.250
mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the
mayor, country-western manager,

10:26.334 --> 10:29.670
garbage commissioner, mountain climber,
farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie,

10:29.754 --> 10:33.090
celebrity assistant, power plant worker,
fortune cookie writer, beer baron,

10:33.174 --> 10:35.175
Kwik-E-Mart clerk,
homophobe and missionary.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.138
But protecting Springfield, that
gives me the best feeling of all.

10:39.222 --> 10:43.475
If you like protecting people,
you can make that your job.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.186
You know, start a security company.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.775
Finally, a way to combine
my love of helping people

10:51.860 --> 10:53.861
with my love of hurting people!

10:55.196 --> 10:59.783
Fellas, I'm starting my own private
police force. Will you join me?

10:59.868 --> 11:02.036
Well, who would my partner be?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.203
How about Lenny?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.664
Him? No way!

11:05.749 --> 11:08.375
You'll do as I say, or
I'll have your badges!

11:08.460 --> 11:10.711
Once I make and give you your badges.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.673
Flanders? I was able to find
your missing leaf-blower,

11:14.758 --> 11:16.175
belt-sander and morning newspapers.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.927
Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.346
Did you catch the thief?

11:20.430 --> 11:22.222
Who said it was a he?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.349
Well, I sure didn't.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.142
Who said you did? Nobody.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.102
Wrong answer! Let's go!

11:27.687 --> 11:29.605
Okely-dokely. You're
pushing your luck, pal.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.732
Here's my commercial!

11:36.780 --> 11:38.614
A monster!

11:38.698 --> 11:43.077
Is this you? If it is, don't dial 911.

11:43.161 --> 11:49.375
Simply dial
636-555-3472.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.837
Help me, SpringShield!

11:54.923 --> 11:57.800
Have no fear, SpringShield's present!

12:06.101 --> 12:08.394
Thank you, SpringShield!

12:08.478 --> 12:09.686
Friend?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.982
The only friend you
need is SpringShield.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.319
Monster put in wallet.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.906
That commercial is very effective.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.909
You know, the old lady's
apartment was actually Lenny's.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.370
We just used a different duvet cover.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.205
Well, they're both lovely.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.089
Hey, Officer Homer, how'd
you get so big and strong?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.007
Green vegetables and homework.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.342
Oh, shucks!

12:42.011 --> 12:44.430
Hey-a, Officer Homer.
You look-a hungry.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.141
I shine-a you up a nice big pizza.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.979
Wow! Look at Dad. People
really respect him.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.648
Hold your heads up high, kids.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.360
I didn't know my chin went that far up.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.823
Oh, yeah, that's the pride.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.785
Homie, to honor
Springfield's newest hero,

13:06.870 --> 13:08.662
I made you your favorite dinner.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.206
All three courses are dessert.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.458
Even dessert?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.502
Dessert is three desserts.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.131
Mr. Mayor, you've been unflinching
in your support of Chief Wiggum.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.134
Yes, I still believe in our
duly appointed police force.

13:22.218 --> 13:27.014
Behind these doors are the finest cops
ever to wriggle into size-46 pants.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.098
Wiggum?

13:31.019 --> 13:34.104
Am I getting warmer?

13:34.189 --> 13:36.356
Clancy, you're a disgrace!

13:37.025 --> 13:38.400
And in my blind rage,

13:38.485 --> 13:41.445
I hereby turn over all
this town's police duties

13:41.529 --> 13:44.239
to Homer Simpson and SpringShield!

13:44.324 --> 13:46.700
Woo-hoo! I'm Chief of Police!

13:46.784 --> 13:48.076
Police? Uh-oh.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.753
Oh, wait. It was better the other way.

14:04.093 --> 14:08.347
Now that I am the law, I'm gonna
make a lot of changes around here.

14:08.431 --> 14:12.768
First, I'm gonna cut overhead by
freeing Otis, the lovable town drunk.

14:14.270 --> 14:19.274
You can let me go, but I'll just
keep exposing myself at the mall.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.318
What a character.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.696
Cool! A lie detector!

14:24.781 --> 14:27.241
Lisa is a dork. Lisa is a dork.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.867
Dad, make him stop!

14:30.119 --> 14:32.120
Well, according to this,
he's telling the truth.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.379
Hurry up, boys.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.840
We've got to get these toy
poodles to the pet shop.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.554
All right, Fat Tony!
Your little game is over.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.846
Hey, how'd you find us?

14:49.931 --> 14:51.974
One of these ferrets is wearing a wire.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.728
You're not a pet and
you're not a friend.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.565
You're nothing to me.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.776
With this latest arrest,
Springfield is now free of crime.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.861
Although overrun with ferrets.

15:04.946 --> 15:08.365
Happy days, people. Truly happy days.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.076
Daddy, how come you're not at work?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.244
I don't know.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.787
How come you're not at school?

15:13.871 --> 15:16.331
My teacher says she's tired of trying.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.710
Yeah, well, so am I, Ralphie. So am I.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.421
It's Bill and Marty
on the line right now

15:22.505 --> 15:24.840
with Springfield's very own Fat Tony.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.342
I wish to announce
that my associates and I

15:27.427 --> 15:29.011
will gun down Homer Simpson

15:29.095 --> 15:32.055
if he has not left
town by noon tomorrow.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.601
Wow, that's quite a threat!

15:35.685 --> 15:37.269
Do you have a song request?

15:37.353 --> 15:38.854
Radar Love.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.648
If that thug thinks he
can run me out of town...

15:41.733 --> 15:43.483
Oh, man, I love this song!

15:43.568 --> 15:46.111
I've been drivin' all night
and I've got sweat on the wheel

15:48.072 --> 15:50.699
There's a voice in my
head that drives my heel

15:52.702 --> 15:55.412
It's my baby callin' on the telephone

15:57.165 --> 15:59.541
I got some pizza and
I'm bringing it home

16:03.796 --> 16:05.172
You all know me.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.841
I've kept the streets safe
for you and your children.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.385
I've tricked or treated
at many of your houses.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.471
Last year, I was Jar Jar Binks.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.723
Now, who will stand and fight with me?

16:17.518 --> 16:18.602
I'm with you, Homer.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.145
Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else?

16:20.229 --> 16:21.730
What about you, Dr. Hibbert?

16:21.814 --> 16:25.859
Oh! Well, I'd love to help you, Homer,

16:25.943 --> 16:28.278
but I have too darn much to live for.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.155
I just discovered Thai food.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.824
I'd help you, but I have
yet to kiss a human girl.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.579
And I've got a TiVo full of
unwatched Dharma and Gregs.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.331
Sorry, Homer.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.125
I'm a coward now, like
all recovering alcoholics.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.920
After everything I did,
you're going to abandon me?

16:47.256 --> 16:50.133
Homie, please, why don't
you just leave town?

16:50.218 --> 16:53.470
What? And let them come
after you and the kids?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.930
We could come with you.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.891
In one car? With no air conditioning?

16:57.975 --> 17:00.143
And the little poop machine
going every 20 minutes?

17:05.900 --> 17:09.861
I need you guys to help me!
Why'd you lock yourselves in?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.988
Hey, why does anyone do anything?

17:12.073 --> 17:13.656
The point is, what's done is done.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.329
My Jersey muscle. It's
so good to see you.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.040
Did you have a nice
flight, Johnny Tightlips?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.334
I ain't sayin' nothin'.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.585
I understand.

17:25.670 --> 17:26.920
How is your mother?

17:27.003 --> 17:29.214
Who says I have a mother?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.967
Very well. Let's do this thing.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.890
You woke up this morning

17:38.975 --> 17:41.059
Got yourself a gun

17:42.019 --> 17:46.273
Mama always said you'd be The Chosen One

17:46.357 --> 17:49.025
She said, "You're one in a million

17:49.110 --> 17:51.737
"You got to burn to shine"

17:51.821 --> 17:54.364
But you were born under a bad sign

17:54.449 --> 17:57.409
With a blue moon in your eyes

17:57.493 --> 18:00.245
And you woke up this morning

18:00.329 --> 18:03.165
And all that love had gone

18:03.249 --> 18:07.794
Your papa never told
you about right and wrong

18:07.879 --> 18:11.006
But you're looking good, baby

18:11.090 --> 18:13.091
I believe you're feeling fine

18:13.176 --> 18:14.259
Shame about it

18:14.343 --> 18:18.263
Born under a bad sign With
a blue moon in your eyes

18:18.347 --> 18:19.473
So, sing it now

18:19.557 --> 18:21.600
Woke up this morning

18:21.684 --> 18:23.143
You got a blue moon

18:23.227 --> 18:25.187
Got a blue moon in your eyes

18:27.356 --> 18:28.732
Is your husband at home?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.735
Fat Tony, how can you do this?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.571
Sorry, but this is the
business we've chosen.

18:34.655 --> 18:39.075
But you're just perpetuating a
negative Italian-American stereotype.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.204
I mean, you could be a pizza man,

18:42.288 --> 18:46.082
organ grinder, leaning-tower maker,

18:46.167 --> 18:49.294
and did I say pizza man?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.672
You are listing my broken dreams.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.800
I don't get it.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.261
I finally did a job where I
wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt

18:58.346 --> 18:59.638
and now I'm going to get killed for it.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.405
Any last words, Simpson?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.616
Yeah. You can kill me,

19:19.700 --> 19:22.619
but someone will take my
place. And if you kill him,

19:22.703 --> 19:24.538
someone will take his place.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.207
And that's pretty much the end of it.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.708
The town will be yours.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.418
All right, let's do it!

19:30.503 --> 19:31.628
Dibs on the crotch.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.712
Oh!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.309
He's got backup!

19:46.394 --> 19:48.311
Somebody does care!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.815
Johnny Tightlips, can
you see the shooter?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.692
I see a lot of things.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.069
You know, you could be
a little more helpful.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.909
Oh! Homie, I'm so glad you're alive!

20:05.288 --> 20:08.206
Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.459
I'm giving this badge
to the next guy I see.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.963
That's funny. Because this is
how I got the job the first time.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.466
I'm so glad this all worked out.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.844
Thanks for saving my husband, Chief.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.137
Hey, I didn't shoot anybody.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.097
They took my gun, they took my badge.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.559
Hell, they would've taken my squad
car if I hadn't hid it under some hay.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.895
Well, then, who shot all the gangsters?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.938
I must have a guardian angel.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.315
With a rifle.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.237
Time to check in on
our little sweetie pie.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.907
Oh. She's taking a nap.

20:41.991 --> 20:47.203
Yeah, probably dreaming about
the time she shot Mr. Burns.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.332
She's just like Clark Kent.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.083
When there's lots of excitement,

20:52.168 --> 20:55.837
she's nowhere to be found.
Nighty-night, sweetie.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.010
You woke up this morning

21:02.094 --> 21:04.638
Got yourself a gun

21:05.305 --> 21:11.785
