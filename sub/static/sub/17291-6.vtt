00:48.252 --> 00:49.652
They're ready now.

01:11.692 --> 01:14.452
Perhaps we could begin with
your earliest recollections

01:14.532 --> 01:16.612
of the events of last May.

01:19.452 --> 01:22.692
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.

01:22.772 --> 01:24.772
Could you move the microphone
a little closer?

01:30.212 --> 01:31.292
Here?

01:35.372 --> 01:38.812
I first got involved on the 15th.

03:02.412 --> 03:04.652
<i>Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended</i>

03:04.732 --> 03:07.452
<i>the government's stance
on disability benefits</i>

03:07.532 --> 03:12.612
<i>as outrage over the death of so-called
"Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.</i>

03:13.172 --> 03:16.452
<i>More than 20,000 people
have signed a petition</i>

03:16.532 --> 03:20.452
<i>demanding the sacking
of newspaper columnist Jo Powers</i>

03:20.532 --> 03:23.852
<i>following her controversial article
about Gwen Marbury.</i>

03:25.092 --> 03:28.532
<i>Conservationists have announced
another extinction.</i>

03:28.612 --> 03:30.532
<i>The Siberian crane has died out</i>

03:30.612 --> 03:34.212
<i>following an unprecedented reduction
in its wetland habitat.</i>

03:35.172 --> 03:39.572
<i>And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects
known as ADIs</i>

03:39.652 --> 03:42.172
<i>have been activated

03:52.932 --> 03:55.572
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.732
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.692
Yo Powers?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.291
<i>Jo </i> Powers.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.052
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?

04:28.452 --> 04:31.492
That's from bakery. For you.

04:34.452 --> 04:36.092
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:55.892 --> 04:57.652
Hello, darling!

05:17.532 --> 05:20.612
Creative, your well-wishers.

05:21.892 --> 05:23.772
Don't eat it.

05:23.852 --> 05:26.292
It's a cake. That's its job.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.972
I'm going to have a bath.

06:08.732 --> 06:10.412
Ah!

06:38.372 --> 06:42.332
<i>Grammy-award-winning
rapper Tusk is still with us.</i>

06:45.292 --> 06:49.172
<i>Now, Tusk,
there are loads of online videos</i>

06:49.252 --> 06:50.572
<i>of people trying to emulate you,</i>

06:50.652 --> 06:54.012
<i>but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.</i>

06:58.092 --> 07:03.812
<i>It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.</i>

07:03.892 --> 07:06.292
<i>That is one goofy-looking kid.</i>

07:06.372 --> 07:08.252
<i>Not a good dancer.</i>

07:08.332 --> 07:11.452
<i>He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.</i>

07:11.532 --> 07:14.012
<i>That young motherfucker can't dance
for shit.</i>

07:14.092 --> 07:16.492
<i>He should probably just give up
now, actually.</i>

07:16.572 --> 07:18.252
<i>Don't hate on me for keeping it real.</i>

07:18.332 --> 07:21.132
<i>That's a goofy little motherfucker,
and he can't dance for shit.</i>

07:21.252 --> 07:23.252
<i>He is a big fan, Tusk.</i>

07:23.332 --> 07:25.492
<i>Don't hate on your boy.</i>

07:25.572 --> 07:27.572
<i>Everybody's got to start somewhere.</i>

07:27.652 --> 07:29.972
<i>Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...</i>

07:49.692 --> 07:52.372
- DCI Parke?
- No press.

07:52.452 --> 07:57.332
No, I'm not press. Um... TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.

07:58.052 --> 08:00.492
My shadow? They said...

08:00.572 --> 08:04.212
Sorry. Call me Karin.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.292
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.

08:06.372 --> 08:09.052
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah. It's not a nickname.

08:09.132 --> 08:12.252
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.

08:12.932 --> 08:14.852
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.

08:15.932 --> 08:17.812
- On video, I mean.
- Boss?

08:18.732 --> 08:21.772
This is Blue. She's my shadow.

08:21.852 --> 08:24.532
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?

08:25.292 --> 08:28.212
- Jo Powers.
- As in...

08:28.292 --> 08:30.132
As in actual Jo Powers.

08:30.212 --> 08:34.172
Saw something she wrote the other day
about the wheelchair woman.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.852
Clickbait piece. Pissed people off.

08:36.932 --> 08:41.251
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.

08:42.412 --> 08:44.452
To get her sacked.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.532
Come on.

09:17.852 --> 09:20.612
Neighbours heard her screaming
and called it in.

09:24.572 --> 09:25.972
Hell of a struggle.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.412
Anyone else at home?

09:35.492 --> 09:39.092
Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.

09:39.172 --> 09:40.732
- By her?
- Don't know.

09:40.812 --> 09:44.092
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.

09:57.412 --> 09:59.652
Her mentions are still pouring in.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.812
Restraining bolt's in place.

10:03.332 --> 10:08.412
- No other points of entry?
- No. But the outside's ringed with CCTV.

10:08.492 --> 10:11.012
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.

10:20.772 --> 10:26.452
Okay, then. Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

10:26.532 --> 10:30.332
Full autop for her, and we question
the husband as soon as he wakes up.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.852
Come on.

10:52.492 --> 10:56.852
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.

10:56.932 --> 11:00.372
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.892
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.

11:04.772 --> 11:08.292
These things are almost always
either drink, drugs or domestic.

11:08.372 --> 11:09.772
It is how it is.

11:11.292 --> 11:14.412
- You driving home?
- No licence. Never passed.

11:14.492 --> 11:16.652
I'm sort of waiting for driverless
to go mainstream.

11:16.732 --> 11:18.372
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.

11:18.452 --> 11:21.692
- Get in.
- Oh. Okay.

11:40.372 --> 11:46.012
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

11:46.092 --> 11:49.332
What happened,
you get bored of it?

11:49.412 --> 11:54.652
Not exactly. You've seen
what people tuck away on these.

11:54.732 --> 11:59.012
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.

11:59.092 --> 12:01.732
I'm old enough to remember
when they walked around with that stuff

12:01.812 --> 12:04.052
just tucked away in their heads.

12:04.132 --> 12:08.212
Right. But now they can't help but
entrusting it to their little companions.

12:08.292 --> 12:12.652
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.

12:14.132 --> 12:16.772
If it's interesting,
why leave Forensics?

12:19.412 --> 12:20.852
The Rannoch case.

12:23.932 --> 12:26.492
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.

12:28.052 --> 12:30.812
I was the one
who cracked his souvenir folder.

12:34.572 --> 12:38.372
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.

12:38.452 --> 12:42.292
And the videos too. Saw them all.

12:46.212 --> 12:49.132
You see something like that,
it changes you.

12:50.412 --> 12:52.412
You either get defeated or you think...

12:52.492 --> 12:55.692
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."

12:57.972 --> 12:59.292
Yeah.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.852
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?

13:04.932 --> 13:08.972
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world,

13:09.612 --> 13:11.892
you can genuinely prevent stuff,
can't you?

13:13.052 --> 13:14.612
You are young.

13:17.092 --> 13:18.532
Maybe you're old?

13:18.612 --> 13:20.572
Steady.

13:28.292 --> 13:29.652
Thanks.

13:31.252 --> 13:33.692
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.

13:48.212 --> 13:51.892
<i>Jo Powers has been found
dead at her home in West London.</i>

13:51.972 --> 13:55.092
<i>The veteran columnist had been
at the centre of controversy</i>

13:55.172 --> 14:00.012
<i>over an article she'd written about
disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.</i>

14:00.092 --> 14:02.132
<i>The police have yet to confirm the cause...</i>

14:16.972 --> 14:19.092
It's just the first floor,
first door on the...

14:26.292 --> 14:30.212
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

14:30.292 --> 14:31.532
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:33.292 --> 14:36.772
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.

14:36.852 --> 14:39.852
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.

14:39.932 --> 14:43.252
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.

14:43.812 --> 14:46.492
They'd have to climb the fence,
make it in and out,

14:46.572 --> 14:47.812
knowing the camera wasn't working,

14:47.892 --> 14:50.732
but yeah, could have happened. Technically.

14:54.132 --> 14:55.772
Okay, sorry.

14:59.492 --> 15:01.252
You're keen to help.

15:01.332 --> 15:03.252
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.

15:32.892 --> 15:35.292
Um... So...

15:35.372 --> 15:38.412
I'm collating every threat
or insult levelled at Jo Powers

15:38.492 --> 15:40.572
over the previous 48 hours.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.372
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

15:46.052 --> 15:49.332
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

15:49.412 --> 15:52.132
Stress levels in that household
would've been through the roof.

15:52.212 --> 15:55.292
That Internet stuff
drifts off like weather.

15:55.372 --> 16:00.412
It's half hate. They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.812
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.

16:06.452 --> 16:09.692
- Yeah. I'm divorced.
- Um...

16:09.772 --> 16:13.852
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.

16:40.172 --> 16:42.372
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

16:43.972 --> 16:49.092
And when I ran in, she was walking
'round the room, stumbling.

16:49.172 --> 16:52.892
She was clutching... She was clutching
her head as if she was in pain.

16:55.252 --> 16:57.012
And then for a moment, she stopped.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.612
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

17:02.132 --> 17:06.732
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

17:12.612 --> 17:14.252
And she turned...

17:19.291 --> 17:24.452
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.212
Then she... she pushed me over.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.852
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

17:30.532 --> 17:34.092
Then she picked it up,
and she started cutting herself.

17:36.372 --> 17:38.692
Here. She was gouging.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.892
I tried to stop her.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.612
But she did this.

17:48.772 --> 17:50.572
Then she cut her throat.

17:52.052 --> 17:53.372
I tried to stop her.

17:54.652 --> 17:56.892
She cut her own throat with the glass!

18:07.092 --> 18:10.972
Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

18:11.052 --> 18:13.012
I'd say the odds are against that.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.972
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.612
Maybe there was something in the cake.

18:16.692 --> 18:18.732
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

18:18.812 --> 18:20.772
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

18:20.852 --> 18:23.452
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

18:23.532 --> 18:25.212
He was sort of convincing.

18:26.412 --> 18:29.212
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."

18:29.292 --> 18:31.132
He's ordinary. That <i>is </i> the type.

18:31.212 --> 18:33.132
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

18:33.212 --> 18:34.652
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...

18:34.732 --> 18:36.132
- Blue.
- What?

18:36.212 --> 18:39.652
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.332
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

18:45.012 --> 18:46.332
Got the name this morning.

18:56.492 --> 19:00.412
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.

19:00.492 --> 19:03.172
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

19:04.452 --> 19:07.612
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends,

19:07.692 --> 19:10.252
that's most of the job.

19:10.332 --> 19:12.692
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just...

19:13.612 --> 19:15.892
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

19:22.172 --> 19:23.892
Okay, that <i>was</i> patronizing.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.612
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.

19:30.532 --> 19:34.052
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

20:01.332 --> 20:05.452
"Death to Jo Powers."
She posted that on Monday morning.

20:10.412 --> 20:15.212
The bakery said that they're
not meant to do obscenities,

20:15.292 --> 20:19.172
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.452
and they agreed, so...

20:22.652 --> 20:27.012
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

20:27.092 --> 20:30.492
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

20:30.572 --> 20:33.132
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?

20:33.212 --> 20:35.612
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.132
I held a sort of whip-round.

20:38.212 --> 20:40.852
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

20:40.932 --> 20:42.412
From 80 other people?

20:43.012 --> 20:45.972
Look, I'm not...

20:46.052 --> 20:49.772
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.

20:50.692 --> 20:52.652
But did you read what she had written?

20:52.732 --> 20:57.092
How much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.692
I don't know.

20:59.972 --> 21:04.492
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

21:04.572 --> 21:08.492
It was funny, okay?

21:08.572 --> 21:12.412
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird,

21:12.492 --> 21:14.212
but I'm not mental.

21:18.972 --> 21:20.172
You wished she was dead.

21:21.452 --> 21:22.652
Well, uh...

21:23.012 --> 21:24.612
No, no, I didn't.

21:27.812 --> 21:31.332
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...

21:31.412 --> 21:35.212
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like "Death to..."

21:35.292 --> 21:37.572
You insert the name
of someone who's being an arsehole.

21:37.652 --> 21:41.492
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

21:41.572 --> 21:43.932
And who started it? The hashtag?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.972
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.012
Excuse us a moment.

21:58.132 --> 22:00.572
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

22:01.212 --> 22:04.572
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."

22:07.692 --> 22:11.092
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

22:11.572 --> 22:14.972
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

22:24.132 --> 22:27.292
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

22:29.412 --> 22:33.012
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

22:43.972 --> 22:46.692
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

22:46.772 --> 22:48.332
We'll bring him in for questioning.

22:51.492 --> 22:56.452
Blue? We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

22:56.532 --> 22:59.012
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

22:59.092 --> 23:00.452
Tusk.

23:02.092 --> 23:04.852
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.172
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

23:12.252 --> 23:14.852
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

23:15.572 --> 23:17.732
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.852
Whoo!

23:39.852 --> 23:41.252
Where my ladies at?

23:42.332 --> 23:45.532
- Yo! Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.

23:45.612 --> 23:47.932
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?

23:48.012 --> 23:50.012
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.

23:50.892 --> 23:51.772
A'ight.

23:52.772 --> 23:54.332
Damn!

23:55.252 --> 23:57.092
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

23:58.412 --> 24:00.332
Don't stress. It's legal here.

24:00.412 --> 24:04.292
Pfft! Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

24:05.252 --> 24:07.652
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.

24:07.732 --> 24:11.372
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

24:12.812 --> 24:14.892
Always doing some bullshit.

24:14.972 --> 24:17.212
Tusk? Tusk?

24:19.412 --> 24:21.572
Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

24:25.852 --> 24:30.292
- I got you.
- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

24:30.372 --> 24:31.732
Call an ambulance!

25:22.412 --> 25:24.852
Commencing.

27:08.012 --> 27:10.012
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.

27:21.732 --> 27:23.252
- Good morning.
- Morning.

27:32.332 --> 27:33.692
She's in here.

27:34.812 --> 27:37.252
So I go in,

27:37.332 --> 27:39.292
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

27:39.372 --> 27:43.652
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

27:43.732 --> 27:46.452
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

27:46.532 --> 27:49.732
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

27:50.412 --> 27:54.572
Where I find this.

27:54.652 --> 27:57.412
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

27:58.372 --> 28:01.412
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.

28:02.212 --> 28:05.372
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.812
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

28:10.212 --> 28:13.692
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.

28:13.772 --> 28:16.372
It crawled right through
her dorsal posterior insula,

28:16.452 --> 28:19.332
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

28:20.452 --> 28:22.252
You're talking agony off the scale.

28:23.332 --> 28:27.732
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.

28:44.612 --> 28:46.692
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

28:46.772 --> 28:49.292
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay. Thank you.

29:17.292 --> 29:19.892
They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

29:19.972 --> 29:22.652
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

29:22.732 --> 29:25.452
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

29:25.532 --> 29:27.532
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

29:27.612 --> 29:31.132
Let me guess,
this is some people on the Internet?

29:31.812 --> 29:34.292
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

29:35.212 --> 29:37.612
There's a schizophrenic world view.

29:51.652 --> 29:55.772
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future,

29:55.852 --> 29:57.172
but here I fucking well am.

30:00.052 --> 30:02.252
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.

30:02.332 --> 30:03.532
Vanessa Dahl.

30:05.612 --> 30:07.532
Please. Follow me.

30:17.492 --> 30:20.572
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADIs?

30:20.692 --> 30:22.292
That's right.

30:23.612 --> 30:24.892
Any particular reason?

30:25.492 --> 30:26.772
Yes.

30:47.332 --> 30:48.332
Rasmus.

30:51.492 --> 30:52.972
Rasmus Sjoberg.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.972
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

30:55.052 --> 30:57.132
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:57.212 --> 31:00.572
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.

31:03.812 --> 31:07.092
So, your bees, your ADIs,
talk me through them.

31:07.172 --> 31:10.892
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

31:10.972 --> 31:13.892
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

31:13.972 --> 31:18.092
so what our ADIs do
is effectively stand in for them.

31:18.172 --> 31:21.292
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

31:21.372 --> 31:23.172
but they pollinate flowers the same way.

31:23.252 --> 31:26.292
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

31:26.372 --> 31:28.412
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

31:28.492 --> 31:30.972
- Can they make honey?
- Uh... No.

31:31.052 --> 31:32.772
I was joking.

31:34.892 --> 31:38.892
How do they know
where the flowers even are? I mean...

31:38.972 --> 31:40.252
Well, they have a sensor.

31:41.252 --> 31:43.412
Like a... camera?

31:43.492 --> 31:46.252
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

31:46.332 --> 31:48.852
You see,
they need rudimentary pattern recognition

31:48.932 --> 31:51.772
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

31:51.852 --> 31:53.852
- <i>They</i> navigate?
- Yes.

31:53.932 --> 31:57.572
You don't... I don't know... steer them?

31:57.652 --> 32:00.212
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

32:00.292 --> 32:02.052
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

32:02.132 --> 32:05.212
Yes. You see, the ADIs
cover the whole of the UK.

32:05.292 --> 32:07.892
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

32:07.972 --> 32:09.572
It's just not logistically possible.

32:09.652 --> 32:13.612
No. We simply set the behaviour
and leave them to it.

32:13.692 --> 32:16.612
They even construct these hives
themselves.

32:16.692 --> 32:17.852
They reproduce...

32:17.932 --> 32:22.572
- They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

32:22.652 --> 32:24.932
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.

32:25.012 --> 32:27.172
They create duplicates of themselves,

32:27.252 --> 32:30.212
create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

32:30.292 --> 32:32.852
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.732
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

32:36.812 --> 32:40.452
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

32:40.532 --> 32:43.132
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

32:43.812 --> 32:44.892
Bees were dying out.

32:46.652 --> 32:49.292
So, what is it that brings you here?

32:51.052 --> 32:55.692
We think one of your ADIs
may be involved in an unexplained death.

32:55.772 --> 32:57.732
Sorry? A death?

32:57.812 --> 32:59.092
Uh-huh.

33:12.412 --> 33:13.652
Thank you.

33:28.172 --> 33:33.732
Yeah. It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...

33:33.812 --> 33:38.132
Kill people? I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

33:39.012 --> 33:43.012
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

33:43.092 --> 33:46.452
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

33:47.532 --> 33:50.332
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

33:50.412 --> 33:51.692
That's impossible.

33:51.772 --> 33:54.292
You see,
it's got military-grade encryption,

33:54.372 --> 33:57.892
and you would need a diagnostic
controller, which is also encrypted.

33:57.972 --> 33:59.692
So I would say the likelihood is...

33:59.772 --> 34:03.092
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as "impossible."

34:10.772 --> 34:13.532
This is every hive we have online.

34:15.732 --> 34:16.851
See...

34:17.931 --> 34:21.891
These are the hives in the building here.

34:22.851 --> 34:26.652
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.052
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.

34:29.132 --> 34:30.931
Is that the search input?

34:31.012 --> 34:34.052
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.

34:37.411 --> 34:40.532
Jo Powers' postcode.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.292
Is that who this is about?

34:42.371 --> 34:45.212
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.331
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

34:48.411 --> 34:51.532
You know, put them in the microwave
for YouTube videos.

34:51.612 --> 34:53.331
And this logs
any that drop off the system?

34:53.411 --> 34:54.452
Logs everything, yes.

34:54.532 --> 34:56.612
Did you lose any around here
on Monday evening?

34:56.692 --> 34:58.012
Well, I can check.

35:00.772 --> 35:06.332
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.

35:08.012 --> 35:09.172
There.

35:11.092 --> 35:14.212
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

35:14.292 --> 35:16.292
When they pass between hives,

35:16.372 --> 35:18.812
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

35:18.892 --> 35:22.932
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?

35:23.012 --> 35:27.572
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

35:27.652 --> 35:32.412
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

35:32.492 --> 35:35.572
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

35:35.652 --> 35:37.092
What's the range on one of those?

35:37.772 --> 35:40.172
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

35:41.292 --> 35:44.332
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

35:44.412 --> 35:47.612
- Outside the house.
- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

35:47.692 --> 35:51.372
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

35:51.452 --> 35:52.452
Uh...

35:53.692 --> 35:58.812
You know what? Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.

36:02.892 --> 36:04.172
Okay.

36:04.252 --> 36:07.372
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

36:07.452 --> 36:11.692
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be... hypothetically speaking?

36:11.772 --> 36:13.772
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem,

36:14.572 --> 36:17.692
and we'd need approval
from the Department of the Environment.

36:17.772 --> 36:21.412
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system,

36:21.492 --> 36:22.572
past or present.

36:22.652 --> 36:24.572
Some were government employees.

36:24.652 --> 36:27.212
Use a different font for those
if it helps.

36:30.172 --> 36:31.252
Bye.

37:00.012 --> 37:02.252
Nick, that's a set
of Granular personnel records.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.732
Root out anyone interesting.

37:03.812 --> 37:05.532
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.

37:05.612 --> 37:07.332
Technically we should refer this up
to the NCA,

37:07.412 --> 37:09.772
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.212
The NCA already knows about it.

37:12.852 --> 37:13.892
What?

37:15.572 --> 37:17.252
DCI Karin Parke?

37:19.532 --> 37:22.132
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

37:23.092 --> 37:24.452
How come you're here?

37:25.572 --> 37:27.052
There's been more than one.

37:41.732 --> 37:43.732
This is Tusk, last night.

37:43.812 --> 37:46.212
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

37:46.292 --> 37:47.372
Took him to the hospital.

37:47.452 --> 37:50.252
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

37:51.172 --> 37:54.772
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

37:54.852 --> 37:57.532
so they popped him in the MRI.

37:57.612 --> 38:01.332
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.572
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.692
Battered the ADI too.

38:09.652 --> 38:12.972
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

38:13.052 --> 38:14.572
It's evidence.

38:14.652 --> 38:18.052
Two's a pattern. It knocks
any malfunction theory in the head.

38:18.132 --> 38:21.132
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

38:21.212 --> 38:23.532
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

38:24.252 --> 38:26.972
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

38:27.052 --> 38:30.132
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

38:30.972 --> 38:34.692
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.492
Fuck.

38:54.052 --> 38:55.172
Fuck.

38:58.972 --> 39:02.332
Guys? Come here.

39:13.412 --> 39:16.652
Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,

39:16.732 --> 39:19.052
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours,

39:19.132 --> 39:22.692
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

39:22.772 --> 39:25.372
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

39:26.492 --> 39:27.892
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

39:27.972 --> 39:31.732
She didn't know where she'd first heard
of it, but trace it back,

39:31.812 --> 39:35.492
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

39:35.572 --> 39:37.612
- By who?
- Uh...

39:37.692 --> 39:39.412
Looks like, um...

39:40.372 --> 39:43.572
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.572
Um...

39:46.652 --> 39:50.052
Automated. It's like spam.

39:50.132 --> 39:53.732
This is someone trying to seed the tag,
you know? Get it out there.

39:53.812 --> 39:57.652
It's like bait. This is someone
wanting people to pick up on it.

39:58.452 --> 40:00.652
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

40:02.812 --> 40:04.372
Bees. Shit.

40:04.452 --> 40:06.052
Okay.

40:07.132 --> 40:08.292
There's more.

40:09.372 --> 40:13.052
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

40:13.132 --> 40:14.452
- Uh-huh.
- There.

40:14.532 --> 40:16.812
"Game of Consequences"?

40:16.892 --> 40:19.092
It's like an unpopularity contest.

40:19.172 --> 40:22.492
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name,

40:22.572 --> 40:24.532
then that's who gets targeted.

40:25.892 --> 40:27.892
Here, watch.

40:27.972 --> 40:30.052
<i>Game of Consequences.</i>

40:31.532 --> 40:34.732
- <i>One: Pick a target.</i>
- Oh, my God.

40:34.812 --> 40:39.012
<i>Two: Post their name and photo
with #DeathTo.</i>

40:39.092 --> 40:40.092
No.

40:40.172 --> 40:45.932
<i>Three: Most popular target
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.</i>

40:46.012 --> 40:48.972
<i>Four: Game resets at midnight.</i>

40:49.052 --> 40:50.892
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.

40:52.612 --> 40:56.892
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

40:57.812 --> 41:02.572
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.

41:05.332 --> 41:09.532
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag
on Jo Powers, okay?

41:09.612 --> 41:13.932
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

41:14.012 --> 41:18.932
- Who's using it now?
- There's... There's loads more people.

41:19.012 --> 41:20.972
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

41:21.052 --> 41:22.812
- Yeah.
- Um...

41:22.892 --> 41:24.652
But at number one...

41:24.732 --> 41:30.172
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

41:30.252 --> 41:33.332
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

41:33.412 --> 41:36.292
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo,

41:36.372 --> 41:39.052
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial.

41:40.252 --> 41:43.372
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.

41:43.452 --> 41:44.852
Yeah, it's getting near the end
of the vote,

41:44.932 --> 41:46.692
and her mentions are blowing up.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.812
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

41:49.892 --> 41:53.852
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.

41:53.932 --> 41:57.532
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.

41:57.612 --> 41:59.652
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

42:01.292 --> 42:03.052
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

42:03.132 --> 42:05.812
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

42:07.892 --> 42:08.892
There.

42:44.492 --> 42:45.772
Hello?

42:49.372 --> 42:53.172
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.

42:53.252 --> 42:54.052
Clara!

42:56.972 --> 43:01.892
Police. For you.
How did they get my number?

43:03.492 --> 43:05.652
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?

43:05.732 --> 43:07.252
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

43:07.332 --> 43:09.692
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

43:09.772 --> 43:13.532
Sorry, is this a joke? Because
all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

43:13.612 --> 43:16.292
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

43:16.372 --> 43:18.092
And keep your windows closed.

43:19.372 --> 43:21.412
I'm setting up a perimeter.

43:21.492 --> 43:23.332
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

43:31.252 --> 43:32.492
- Rasmus?
- <i>Hi, Blue.</i>

43:32.572 --> 43:34.652
<i>I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.</i>

43:34.732 --> 43:36.412
I need you to monitor the area.

43:36.492 --> 43:40.612
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

43:40.692 --> 43:41.772
<i>Yeah, great, good.</i>

43:41.852 --> 43:43.772
Look, if they come back,

43:43.852 --> 43:45.572
I think I can catch them.

43:45.652 --> 43:47.612
<i>I have basically set a trap.</i>

43:47.692 --> 43:50.532
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.

44:03.572 --> 44:07.252
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

44:07.332 --> 44:10.652
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

44:10.732 --> 44:13.612
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

44:13.692 --> 44:15.172
Let's go.

44:25.812 --> 44:27.212
We can take her here.

44:27.292 --> 44:29.372
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.932
<i>No target sighted.</i>

44:50.452 --> 44:53.092
<i>This is a police operation!</i>

44:54.412 --> 44:57.492
<i>Everybody vacate their premises now.</i>

44:58.252 --> 44:59.692
<i>Please leave...</i>

45:05.652 --> 45:07.932
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.

45:25.492 --> 45:29.332
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.

45:29.412 --> 45:30.732
Granular, they've got a breach.

45:33.812 --> 45:37.132
- <i>One ADI just went offline.</i>
- Where?

45:37.212 --> 45:41.012
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

45:41.092 --> 45:42.772
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

45:42.852 --> 45:44.772
they're gonna turn 'round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

45:52.892 --> 45:56.332
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

45:56.412 --> 45:59.452
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

46:41.692 --> 46:44.212
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

47:02.372 --> 47:05.852
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

47:33.612 --> 47:35.372
Just gotta call in.

47:40.972 --> 47:42.012
Hi.

47:43.772 --> 47:45.492
No, not yet.

47:46.932 --> 47:50.412
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

47:51.972 --> 47:54.132
Understood.

48:07.972 --> 48:10.252
They housed a witness here for a while,
Shaun said.

48:10.332 --> 48:13.972
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?

48:14.052 --> 48:15.132
No.

48:16.332 --> 48:17.812
No plans.

48:28.972 --> 48:30.092
Up the stairs.

48:44.372 --> 48:48.652
- Rasmus.
- <i>Still nothing. I can't trace it.</i>

49:05.372 --> 49:07.932
At least there's an en-suite.

49:11.692 --> 49:13.652
- Is there nothing?
- <i>No.</i>

49:13.732 --> 49:16.412
<i>Whoever it is,
they've masked their path well.</i>

49:18.412 --> 49:19.772
But that's not...

49:22.332 --> 49:24.692
- Fuck.
- <i>What?</i>

49:24.772 --> 49:27.772
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

49:27.852 --> 49:29.212
<i>Packed full of ADIs.</i>

49:29.292 --> 49:30.572
Lost them all too.

49:30.652 --> 49:33.492
- No... Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.

49:33.572 --> 49:36.572
- Where?
- It's close to your location.

49:36.652 --> 49:38.052
Rasmus, say that again.

49:38.132 --> 49:41.492
Blue? Blue. It's close...
It's very close to you.

49:43.092 --> 49:46.812
Text it. Text it to me.
Rasmus. Text it to... Shit.

49:47.572 --> 49:49.012
Do I get to redecorate?

49:58.612 --> 50:02.052
Hello. Hello.

50:12.172 --> 50:13.652
No...

50:15.412 --> 50:16.852
They've got the whole thing.

50:18.132 --> 50:19.972
We're not in control anymore.

50:20.052 --> 50:22.652
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?

50:23.812 --> 50:27.452
- Fix it! Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!

51:05.892 --> 51:07.212
Shit.

51:10.612 --> 51:12.572
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

51:18.572 --> 51:20.372
Go. Go, go, go.

51:27.532 --> 51:29.692
What's... what's happening?

51:49.052 --> 51:50.412
Karin...

52:04.492 --> 52:06.212
In there! Go!

52:11.652 --> 52:14.372
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!

52:14.452 --> 52:15.652
You're scaring the shit out of me!

53:00.412 --> 53:01.772
Oh! Fuck!

53:32.732 --> 53:35.412
The fan! The fan!

53:44.012 --> 53:46.212
Get it away from me!

54:59.172 --> 55:00.172
Take your time.

55:09.332 --> 55:12.172
I'd seen so many bodies before.

55:14.052 --> 55:16.652
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.772
But I'd never seen anyone die.

55:25.172 --> 55:26.732
And she was right there.

55:29.772 --> 55:34.652
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

55:37.092 --> 55:38.772
Blue took it hard.

55:45.212 --> 55:46.212
Uh-huh.

55:48.972 --> 55:50.572
I'll shut it down.

56:09.532 --> 56:13.292
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

56:13.372 --> 56:16.492
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

56:16.572 --> 56:17.892
But there were thousands of them.

56:18.492 --> 56:19.892
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.

56:19.972 --> 56:21.892
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.

56:21.972 --> 56:24.692
Whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

56:24.772 --> 56:26.492
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.

56:26.572 --> 56:29.252
You need to fucking sort this out!

56:36.612 --> 56:39.012
How do the ADIs know who to target?

56:40.572 --> 56:43.772
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database?

56:43.852 --> 56:45.772
No. That just gives you the basic area.

56:45.852 --> 56:48.572
We were in the room too,
and they only went for her.

56:51.252 --> 56:54.372
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

56:54.452 --> 56:57.692
Which means the feed from their visual
sensors, that's been accessed too.

56:57.772 --> 56:59.492
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.

56:59.572 --> 57:03.572
Now look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

57:03.652 --> 57:05.452
- There you go.
- Although...

57:05.532 --> 57:08.052
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

57:08.132 --> 57:09.172
Okay. Enough.

57:09.252 --> 57:13.812
We had to consent to permitting
government security services

57:13.892 --> 57:18.972
access to the visual feed at times
of quote, "increased national security."

57:19.052 --> 57:22.732
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

57:23.292 --> 57:24.972
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

57:25.052 --> 57:28.972
That implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

57:30.612 --> 57:32.892
- So they <i>are</i> spying on us.
- This is all classified.

57:33.412 --> 57:37.892
So what did you do, did you put in
a back door and route it through GCHQ?

57:37.972 --> 57:40.932
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

57:41.012 --> 57:42.892
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

57:42.972 --> 57:46.612
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

57:46.692 --> 57:49.572
Well, that's great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

57:49.652 --> 57:52.092
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

57:52.172 --> 57:55.692
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
and it grabs 200 green votes.

57:55.772 --> 57:58.732
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

57:58.812 --> 58:01.452
Total nationwide surveillance.

58:01.532 --> 58:04.012
We tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

58:04.092 --> 58:07.692
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

58:07.772 --> 58:09.812
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

58:09.892 --> 58:11.772
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

58:13.212 --> 58:15.492
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us,

58:15.572 --> 58:17.252
but no,
you kept your little fucking secret.

58:17.372 --> 58:22.252
Okay! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

58:22.332 --> 58:24.932
Word's going to get out about Clara.

58:25.012 --> 58:29.572
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on,

58:29.652 --> 58:31.972
and soon we're going to have another body.

58:33.532 --> 58:35.612
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

58:35.692 --> 58:38.772
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

58:39.812 --> 58:41.412
If I can work out how they got in,

58:41.492 --> 58:45.652
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

58:45.732 --> 58:48.492
Do the ADIs have a command log,
on-board cache?

58:48.572 --> 58:50.772
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.

59:01.932 --> 59:04.532
Been through the employee files,
found some POIs.

59:05.092 --> 59:06.452
Bring them in.

59:08.452 --> 59:10.932
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

59:11.012 --> 59:12.172
I've got to be somewhere.

59:26.132 --> 59:27.892
<i>It's 7:15.</i>

59:27.972 --> 59:31.572
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

59:31.652 --> 59:33.612
<i>Controversial journalist Jo Powers...</i>

59:33.692 --> 59:36.492
<i>Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?</i>

59:36.572 --> 59:38.172
<i>Is it real or an urban myth?</i>

59:38.252 --> 59:42.252
<i>Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?</i>

59:42.332 --> 59:45.452
<i>People are dying,</i>
<i>and</i> we <i>want to hear your thoughts.</i>

59:45.532 --> 59:47.092
<i>Line seven, Liana...</i>

59:47.172 --> 59:49.692
<i>This is real, this is happening...</i>

59:49.812 --> 59:51.852
<i>I am happy to see her die.</i>

59:51.932 --> 59:55.612
<i>It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.</i>

59:55.692 --> 59:59.012
<i>Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.</i>

59:59.132 --> 01:00:00.612
<i>Steve, line five.</i>

01:00:00.692 --> 01:00:03.412
<i>Yeah, but my point is,
someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?</i>

01:00:03.492 --> 01:00:06.572
<i>So why not make it someone,
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.</i>

01:00:06.652 --> 01:00:09.492
<i>With the hashtag, I've seen
celebrities, politicians, everyone.</i>

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:12.612
<i>This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.</i>

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.812
<i>The point is this is already happening.</i>

01:00:14.892 --> 01:00:16.292
<i>And people know that they can jump onboard</i>

01:00:16.372 --> 01:00:18.732
<i>because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.</i>

01:00:18.812 --> 01:00:21.612
<i>Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.</i>

01:00:21.692 --> 01:00:24.932
<i>As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,</i>

01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:26.732
<i>and I want us to think about that.</i>

01:00:26.812 --> 01:00:28.972
<i>What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?</i>

01:00:29.052 --> 01:00:32.852
<i>Well, I can't say I'm surprised
that he's number one on the list.</i>

01:00:32.932 --> 01:00:35.172
<i>He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.</i>

01:00:35.252 --> 01:00:37.572
<i>But does that warrant
his place on this list?</i>

01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:40.332
<i>I'm saying people don't have to
think too hard about it.</i>

01:00:40.452 --> 01:00:41.532
<i>Now that's he's number one,</i>

01:00:41.612 --> 01:00:45.172
<i>that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.</i>

01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:02.932
Thanks for your time.

01:01:09.852 --> 01:01:12.732
- No good?
- No good.

01:01:39.052 --> 01:01:41.692
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

01:01:41.772 --> 01:01:44.052
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

01:01:44.132 --> 01:01:47.292
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

01:01:47.372 --> 01:01:49.772
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:52.452
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

01:01:52.532 --> 01:01:54.492
Farrington's number four,
and he's a paedophile.

01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:57.812
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:05.492
Let's just shut it down. All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

01:02:06.252 --> 01:02:07.452
Just for today,

01:02:07.532 --> 01:02:09.132
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

01:02:09.212 --> 01:02:10.532
and he actually catches someone.

01:02:10.612 --> 01:02:12.532
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

01:02:12.612 --> 01:02:15.172
- But it's possible? We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

01:02:15.252 --> 01:02:18.692
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:20.812
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.

01:02:21.532 --> 01:02:23.092
- No?
- Not in my opinion.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:28.772
Right, okay. It's just that speaking
as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:31.172
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

01:02:31.252 --> 01:02:32.252
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.812
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:39.172
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

01:02:39.252 --> 01:02:42.572
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report? The archive job?

01:02:43.452 --> 01:02:45.652
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

01:02:45.732 --> 01:02:48.532
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.

01:02:48.652 --> 01:02:50.452
Tom, that would be a smear.

01:02:50.532 --> 01:02:52.572
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

01:02:52.652 --> 01:02:55.172
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

01:02:55.252 --> 01:02:59.772
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.

01:02:59.852 --> 01:03:04.092
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:05.972
I'll show you.

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:21.372
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:23.292
So not much
in the way of technical skills.

01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:26.252
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

01:03:26.332 --> 01:03:29.572
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

01:03:29.652 --> 01:03:32.972
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,
said he'd harassed her,

01:03:33.052 --> 01:03:34.172
lewd comments or something.

01:03:34.252 --> 01:03:37.612
Turned out he had a learning disability
so she caught a ton of shit on...

01:03:37.692 --> 01:03:39.172
On social media.

01:03:47.652 --> 01:03:50.532
- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

01:03:59.692 --> 01:04:06.132
It was like having a whole weather system
turn against me.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:11.612
Just hate message after hate message,
around the clock, all piling on.

01:04:13.612 --> 01:04:16.132
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

01:04:16.692 --> 01:04:20.132
Suddenly
there's a million invisible people,

01:04:20.212 --> 01:04:23.492
all talking about how they despise you.

01:04:25.452 --> 01:04:27.772
It's like a mental illness.

01:04:33.532 --> 01:04:34.332
Fuck.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.372
What?

01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:46.692
Shit.

01:04:47.772 --> 01:04:50.852
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

01:04:50.932 --> 01:04:55.412
but the way people enjoyed kicking me,
that's what got to me.

01:04:57.452 --> 01:05:01.892
The casual fun they had and, um...

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:06.292
I just felt I couldn't go on.

01:05:11.052 --> 01:05:12.212
Who found you?

01:05:14.972 --> 01:05:17.972
Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

01:05:18.052 --> 01:05:21.212
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I'd slashed them.

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:26.092
I mean, it's crazy.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.772
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath,

01:05:29.852 --> 01:05:33.172
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, "I'm naked."

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:39.012
He tied towels 'round my wrists,
kept me conscious,

01:05:39.092 --> 01:05:44.172
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:48.412
Sort of weird.

01:05:49.692 --> 01:05:51.972
I think he always had a thing for me.

01:05:52.052 --> 01:05:55.972
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:59.572
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

01:05:59.652 --> 01:06:04.372
- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?

01:06:05.372 --> 01:06:08.532
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

01:06:13.812 --> 01:06:16.572
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

01:06:16.652 --> 01:06:18.772
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

01:06:18.852 --> 01:06:21.172
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers' ADI.

01:06:21.252 --> 01:06:24.972
- What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

01:06:27.252 --> 01:06:29.732
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:44.932
<i>So we're good to go?</i>

01:06:53.252 --> 01:06:54.772
<i>Okay, that's the charge in place.</i>

01:06:54.892 --> 01:06:57.852
Okay. Pull back.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:03.972
<i>We're all set here.</i>

01:07:04.052 --> 01:07:05.212
Detonate.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:16.092
So, the plan is,
we move you to an underground bunker,

01:07:16.852 --> 01:07:19.372
knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.372
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

01:07:22.052 --> 01:07:23.332
It's a temporary measure.

01:07:25.012 --> 01:07:27.212
How long till you take out all the hives?

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:30.812
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

01:07:30.892 --> 01:07:32.732
Two years, a victim a day.

01:07:32.812 --> 01:07:34.852
More to the point,
the environmental impact would...

01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:36.572
Fuck that.

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:38.172
<i>Shit!</i>

01:07:39.252 --> 01:07:40.812
- <i>What?
- Fuck!</i>

01:07:41.372 --> 01:07:44.212
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:45.612
<i>Get back!</i>

01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:54.252
<i>Go, go, go! Get away!</i>

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.292
<i>For fuck's sake, move!</i>

01:08:08.932 --> 01:08:10.292
What's your Plan B?

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.971
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

01:08:46.051 --> 01:08:47.452
He left the country six months ago.

01:08:47.532 --> 01:08:49.372
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

01:08:49.452 --> 01:08:51.971
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:55.252
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

01:08:56.252 --> 01:08:58.532
"Thanks to the technological revolution,

01:08:58.612 --> 01:09:03.452
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

01:09:03.532 --> 01:09:07.051
Only by being forced to recognize
the power technology grants us,

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:09.372
to acknowledge
individual responsibility..."

01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:11.332
Is it all like this?

01:09:11.892 --> 01:09:15.971
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty,

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.572
that it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

01:09:18.652 --> 01:09:22.732
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

01:09:22.812 --> 01:09:26.612
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.372
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

01:09:32.452 --> 01:09:33.732
Well, fuck him.

01:09:53.971 --> 01:09:55.012
Fuck.

01:10:34.852 --> 01:10:36.092
Shit.

01:10:37.932 --> 01:10:41.612
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:47.372
He's put this document
together himself, right?

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:50.772
His author name's in the metadata.

01:10:50.852 --> 01:10:52.452
But he stripped out everything else,

01:10:52.532 --> 01:10:54.612
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

01:10:54.692 --> 01:10:55.572
Mm-hmm.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:59.372
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

01:10:59.452 --> 01:11:01.892
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

01:11:01.972 --> 01:11:04.852
He's taken it with his phone,
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

01:11:04.932 --> 01:11:08.732
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

01:11:08.812 --> 01:11:11.932
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

01:11:54.052 --> 01:11:56.332
- Armed police! Stay down!
- Armed police!

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:01.852
Armed police! Stay where you are!
Armed police! Show yourselves!

01:12:10.252 --> 01:12:11.452
Move!

01:12:12.932 --> 01:12:13.972
Left.

01:12:15.252 --> 01:12:16.612
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:12:16.692 --> 01:12:18.412
Clear!

01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:16.012
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

01:13:22.852 --> 01:13:25.012
There. The forge.

01:13:33.452 --> 01:13:35.012
Nice one.

01:13:35.092 --> 01:13:38.052
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

01:13:50.252 --> 01:13:54.212
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

01:13:54.772 --> 01:13:57.692
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

01:13:57.772 --> 01:14:01.452
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

01:14:01.532 --> 01:14:03.572
Well, I've got his source code.

01:14:04.652 --> 01:14:06.932
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

01:14:07.012 --> 01:14:08.732
Key to the door?

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:11.892
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

01:14:12.972 --> 01:14:14.372
Well, I'm in.

01:14:14.932 --> 01:14:17.372
Okay. Deactivate her.

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:21.012
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:27.332
That's weird.

01:14:27.412 --> 01:14:28.852
What's weird?

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:32.052
- Time's ticking.
- That file. Wasn't there before.

01:14:32.652 --> 01:14:33.732
- This file?
- Yeah.

01:14:40.252 --> 01:14:41.252
What is it?

01:14:46.052 --> 01:14:48.572
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.972
What does that mean?

01:14:51.052 --> 01:14:56.132
Every phone, every device
has a unique number, an IMEI number.

01:14:56.212 --> 01:14:58.372
It tethers it to a unique user.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.892
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

01:15:01.972 --> 01:15:03.292
Take it easy.

01:15:04.652 --> 01:15:05.892
Who are these people?

01:15:05.972 --> 01:15:08.972
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.

01:15:09.052 --> 01:15:11.212
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

01:15:11.292 --> 01:15:14.372
- No! Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

01:15:14.452 --> 01:15:15.892
Wait. Wait.

01:15:16.652 --> 01:15:19.372
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.

01:15:19.452 --> 01:15:21.612
- Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

01:15:24.212 --> 01:15:26.132
Fuck's sake.

01:15:30.452 --> 01:15:32.692
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

01:15:32.772 --> 01:15:33.772
What?

01:15:33.852 --> 01:15:36.092
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

01:15:36.172 --> 01:15:39.732
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

01:15:40.692 --> 01:15:42.612
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:46.572
- See if I'm on there.
- What?

01:15:46.652 --> 01:15:48.812
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

01:15:50.452 --> 01:15:53.612
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

01:15:53.692 --> 01:15:54.492
Yeah, you're there.

01:15:56.772 --> 01:15:58.252
Almost there.

01:16:00.332 --> 01:16:02.772
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

01:16:04.652 --> 01:16:06.532
Okay. I'm ready.

01:16:07.852 --> 01:16:10.052
- Shit.
- Run it now.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.972
No. Think. He left us a trail.

01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:15.052
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts,

01:16:15.132 --> 01:16:17.612
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

01:16:17.692 --> 01:16:22.172
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

01:16:22.252 --> 01:16:23.692
something to do with that list.

01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:29.012
What if those are his real targets?

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:33.532
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.

01:16:35.212 --> 01:16:36.972
Consequences.

01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:41.412
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.

01:16:44.252 --> 01:16:46.812
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?

01:16:46.892 --> 01:16:48.012
- Run it.
- No!

01:17:01.772 --> 01:17:03.572
Yeah.

01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:06.972
Yeah, it worked.

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:12.532
Sorry, but that needed doing.

01:17:18.612 --> 01:17:22.292
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:24.012
No. No.

01:17:26.332 --> 01:17:27.972
- Fuck!
- No.

01:17:32.052 --> 01:17:33.452
Shit.

01:17:37.012 --> 01:17:38.532
Oh, no.

01:18:58.652 --> 01:18:59.972
There's...

01:22:08.452 --> 01:22:13.812
We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

01:22:15.652 --> 01:22:19.292
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:22.212
of the loss of life that followed.

01:22:24.852 --> 01:22:27.972
No. No, we don't.

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:11.412
And what became of Ms. Colson?

01:23:14.852 --> 01:23:16.972
I think she blamed herself.

01:23:17.812 --> 01:23:20.892
No. I know she did.

01:23:22.652 --> 01:23:28.292
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb
trail and sprung the whole thing.

01:23:33.652 --> 01:23:35.492
She left the force.

01:23:36.652 --> 01:23:38.732
I didn't hear from her.

01:23:39.652 --> 01:23:42.612
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

01:23:45.852 --> 01:23:47.372
Then, um...

01:23:52.252 --> 01:23:58.252
About four months later,
they found her things.
