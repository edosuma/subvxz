- Yeah?

01:53.712 --> 01:54.839

always protect me, so...

02:43.700 --> 02:45.580
Now it's gonna protect you.

02:46.888 --> 02:48.628
I have you to protect me.

02:48.628 --> 02:51.100

have me to protect you.

- Aw, okay look.

02:53.060 --> 02:56.020
Why don't you hang on to
it, because I have you.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.020
I wanna know that you're safe,

02:57.020 --> 02:59.607

you're gonna protect me,

03:20.808 --> 03:23.308
I'm gonna go to work.

03:23.308 --> 03:26.044
I'm gonna make sure I
don't come back too late.

03:26.044 --> 03:27.140
When I get back...

03:27.140 --> 03:28.068
- Yeah?

03:28.068 --> 03:31.780

But, in the meantime, don't
you have some studying to do?

03:39.888 --> 03:40.721
- I do.

03:42.218 --> 03:43.539
- Can't be a doctor--
- I am now, kind of,

03:43.539 --> 03:45.698
but I'm kind of, you're an asshole.

03:45.698 --> 03:48.418
- But you can't be a doctor
if you flunking your classes.

03:48.418 --> 03:52.079
- Okay fine, have it your own way, then.

03:52.079 --> 03:53.199
Have it your own way.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.258
I love you.

bombed a guerrilla base,

Someone just murdered her man.

Did he have problems with anybody?

06:51.354 --> 06:54.554
Or should I say, everybody
got problems with you.

things you don't mess with:

07:07.594 --> 07:09.594
a man's money and women,

07:10.674 --> 07:12.453
and they don't have to be in that order.

07:12.453 --> 07:14.975
- Okay, see that's what I don't get.

07:14.975 --> 07:16.634
He didn't have problems with anybody.

07:16.634 --> 07:18.413
He didn't owe nobody.

07:18.413 --> 07:21.324

I'm sure he has his own reason,

07:35.375 --> 07:38.604
just like everybody else here does.

But it damn sure ain't to support me.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.653
(sighing)

- Yes, because I don't
plan on doing this forever.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.804
I mean, this is not my end game, big bro.

08:01.804 --> 08:03.714
This is just a stepping stone.

08:03.714 --> 08:05.034
- Point is, you makin' more money

08:05.034 --> 08:07.794
than all the damn teachers at the school.

08:07.794 --> 08:10.735
So this little end game
ain't all that bad.

08:10.735 --> 08:13.973
- Yeah, but this end game
comes with one hell of a cost.

And one of our closest
friends just paid that price.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.444
I don't know.

08:56.444 --> 08:57.773
- What do you mean, you don't know?

08:57.773 --> 08:58.606
- I don't know.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.754
He never told me.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.844
He never put me in that world.

09:01.844 --> 09:05.344
Our life was this house and us, that's it.

09:06.404 --> 09:08.135

09:08.135 --> 09:09.468
- You all right?

09:12.034 --> 09:13.933
Man, you should have never asked her that.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.746

09:15.746 --> 09:18.514
- When is the right time?

09:50.004 --> 09:51.695
Okay, get a grip.

10:32.274 --> 10:34.432
- My point is, I'm gonna
need a place to live

10:34.432 --> 10:36.242
since you don't wanna
share what my son left us.

10:36.242 --> 10:37.804
- You are so sick.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.764
Your son hasn't even
been dead two full weeks

10:39.764 --> 10:41.833
and you're asking me what he left for you?

10:41.833 --> 10:43.422
You never showed up here to see us.

10:43.422 --> 10:45.172
You never called to say hi.

10:45.172 --> 10:47.444
Oh, you called all right, but
when you wanted something.

10:47.444 --> 10:49.602
Not needed it, but wanted.

10:49.602 --> 10:50.542
You want me out, that's fine.

10:50.542 --> 10:51.742
You can have this place.

10:51.742 --> 10:52.622
I'll be out in a month.

10:52.622 --> 10:53.542
- Make it a week.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.913
- Oh, you are so lucky you're his mother.

10:55.913 --> 10:57.134
That is the only thing keeping me

10:57.134 --> 10:58.961
from punching you in the face right now.

10:58.961 --> 11:00.561
- Who the fuck you think
you talking to right now?

11:00.561 --> 11:01.593
- I'm talking to your
mother bitch, and you, too.

11:01.593 --> 11:02.713
- [Man] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:02.713 --> 11:04.374
- [Woman] Get off my cousin, bitch.

11:04.374 --> 11:05.484
(tense music)

11:05.484 --> 11:06.484
- Let me go.

11:08.425 --> 11:10.323
Get out of my way, Pop.

11:10.323 --> 11:12.014
(tense music)

11:12.014 --> 11:12.847
- What are you gonna do?

11:12.847 --> 11:14.753
Kill that man's mama and his sister?

11:14.753 --> 11:15.586
What are you gonna do?

11:15.586 --> 11:17.385
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.802
Get outta my way.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.254
- [Pop] You done lost your damn mind.

11:22.254 --> 11:24.105
- No, I lost my man, and
you and your daughter

11:24.105 --> 11:25.076
are about to lose more than that

11:25.076 --> 11:26.985
if you don't get the fuck outta my house.

11:26.985 --> 11:28.937
- [Woman] Let's go.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.926
- Maria, give me the goddamn gun.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.914
like you don't know that.

14:27.914 --> 14:30.133
- So how was your date with Carl?

14:30.133 --> 14:30.966
- Date?

14:30.966 --> 14:32.633
Girl, wasn't hardly a date.

14:32.633 --> 14:35.343
All he did was talk about
hisself the entire night.

14:35.343 --> 14:36.176
- Really?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.112
- Yeah.

14:37.112 --> 14:38.743
Betcha he couldn't even remember my name,

14:38.743 --> 14:41.984
but he could tell you how
many asses walked by him.

14:41.984 --> 14:44.552
- He was not checkin' out
other women on your first date.

14:44.552 --> 14:45.725
- Absolutely.

14:45.725 --> 14:48.023
Probably could tell ya
all the shapes and sizes.

14:48.023 --> 14:50.773
(train clacking)

14:52.752 --> 14:54.104
- Man, you gotta come down on the prices

14:54.104 --> 14:55.205
with that next shipment, man.

14:55.205 --> 14:56.413
You and your brother killin' me, man,

14:56.413 --> 15:00.245
charging me top dollar like
I ain't made y'all millions.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.954
- I would have politely
excused myself to the restroom

15:02.954 --> 15:04.872
and disappeared on that jerk.

15:04.872 --> 15:05.994
- Yeah.

15:05.994 --> 15:07.553
I thought about it, but
I haven't been on a date

15:07.553 --> 15:09.512
in so long, you know that,

15:09.512 --> 15:11.573
so, I was just hopin' it didn't get worse.

15:11.573 --> 15:12.765
- I have a right to
complain, as much money

15:12.765 --> 15:14.033
as I done made y'all.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.074
I should be the only person in this city

15:15.074 --> 15:17.613
pushing this product.

15:17.613 --> 15:19.944
This arrangement is not cuttin' it for me.

15:19.944 --> 15:22.583
- That is the reason why
women date younger men.

15:22.583 --> 15:25.565
You can train them to be
whoever you want them to be.

15:25.565 --> 15:27.073

15:29.513 --> 15:30.404
- Naw, you did that.

15:30.404 --> 15:33.332
(gunshot blasting)

15:33.332 --> 15:35.272
- Then they do it, girl.

15:35.272 --> 15:37.062
Girl, they be barking.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.204
- Yeah, then you gotta play they mom.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.633
I'm not trying to play nobody's mom.

15:39.633 --> 15:41.370
- [Woman] I ain't playing nobody's mama.

15:51.169 --> 15:53.222
- Well, I guess you in charge now.

15:53.222 --> 15:54.841
(tense music)

15:54.841 --> 15:56.641
But first I need you to
get rid of that body.

15:56.641 --> 16:00.422
You'll be contacted where
to pick up your work.

16:00.422 --> 16:03.172
(train clacking)

16:09.884 --> 16:10.717
- [Will] What's going on?

16:10.717 --> 16:11.804
- [Maria] What took you so long?

16:11.804 --> 16:12.804
- 'Sup, bro?

16:14.733 --> 16:16.273
- You always got us waitin' on you.

16:16.273 --> 16:18.513

only one that be working.

16:18.513 --> 16:21.785
You acting all busy with school and cuz,

16:21.785 --> 16:24.004
you ain't got your mother
fucking hands dirty in years.

16:24.004 --> 16:26.692
- I get my hands dirty every
time I go meet the connect,

16:26.692 --> 16:29.333
so don't act like we don't be
puttin' in work just like you.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.175
You handle distribution,
Sean handles gettin' it here,

16:32.175 --> 16:33.812

16:33.812 --> 16:36.225
You wanna do my job, cuz, then feel free,

16:38.049 --> 16:40.133

16:40.133 --> 16:41.723
My life is the one on the line, all right,

16:41.723 --> 16:44.642
not yours if a shipment gets fucked up.

16:44.642 --> 16:45.475
- Okay.

16:47.304 --> 16:48.137
It's not that serious.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.344
I'm just playin' with you.

16:49.344 --> 16:53.672
- Well maybe everybody's not
always in a playin' mood, bro.

16:53.672 --> 16:54.505
So, what's up, man?

16:54.505 --> 16:55.544
What you got us here for?

16:55.544 --> 16:57.304
- Well, we got a new distro named Mo.

16:57.304 --> 16:59.054
C, no longer with us.

17:00.322 --> 17:01.544
- What you mean by that?

17:01.544 --> 17:02.922
- Found a new connect.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.712
Basically, he informed me
that he would no longer

17:04.712 --> 17:07.492
need us, but he gonna keep
the property we gave him.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.632
- You gotta be shittin' me?

17:08.632 --> 17:10.031
- No, no shit.

17:10.031 --> 17:11.872
But his right hand man, Mo, told me

17:11.872 --> 17:13.882
weeks ago he was messin'
with this mother fucker.

17:13.882 --> 17:16.852
They offer him more
work at a better price.

17:16.852 --> 17:17.832
- And what price is that?

17:17.832 --> 17:19.285
- Shit, who knows?

17:19.285 --> 17:21.521
All I know is I wasn't
givin' him our blocks.

17:21.521 --> 17:23.893
Them mother fuckers been
cuttin' into our people lately,

17:23.893 --> 17:25.962
and I think they want us to come at 'em.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.362
- Yeah,

17:27.362 --> 17:30.195
so what do you suggest we do, huh?

17:31.211 --> 17:34.013
Look, bro, 'cause I'm done
with this after I graduate.

17:34.013 --> 17:37.882
You and Maria got enough money
to last y'all a lifetime.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.530
Do we really need these problems?

17:40.530 --> 17:42.802
Come on, bro, we had a great run.

17:42.802 --> 17:43.909
- Great run?

17:43.909 --> 17:46.069
Nigger, don't count my
mother fucking pockets.

17:46.069 --> 17:47.650
I'm not counting yours.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.380
I'm not done when you graduate.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.271
You're gonna be done, but I'm on this

17:52.271 --> 17:54.042
mother fucking plane
'til the wings fall off.

17:54.042 --> 17:55.549
- Come on, guys, calm down.

17:55.549 --> 17:58.220
Look, Sean, we can't
let nobody come in here

17:58.220 --> 18:01.191
and take what we worked
so hard for, all right?

18:01.191 --> 18:04.122
Will, find out who these
new mother fuckers are.

18:04.122 --> 18:06.282
Get some of our people
to take care of 'em.

18:06.282 --> 18:09.290
- It makes no sense for us to do anything.

18:09.290 --> 18:10.660
Look, our people not just gonna stop

18:10.660 --> 18:12.930
fucking with us just because.

18:12.930 --> 18:15.110
Our product is way too good,

18:15.110 --> 18:16.309
and they not gonna find nobody else

18:16.309 --> 18:18.448
to give 'em the prices that we givin' 'em.

18:18.448 --> 18:20.640
- Look, but I'm sayin' let's handle them

18:20.640 --> 18:21.920
before they handle us.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.508
- That's all I'm saying, see?

18:24.508 --> 18:26.827
- Yeah whatever, man.

18:26.827 --> 18:28.320
It's my last go-around.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.440
Like I said, I'm done.

18:30.440 --> 18:34.168
- You keep sayin' that silly-ass shit.

18:34.168 --> 18:37.310
I mean, what you plannin'
on doin', college boy?

18:37.310 --> 18:40.107
Nigger, you's a mother
fuckin' drug dealer.

18:40.107 --> 18:42.107
That's all you gonna be.

18:43.908 --> 18:46.680
- And that's why we here now.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.440
Your kids'll never want for
anything because of us three.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.273
We good.

18:51.273 --> 18:52.747
- Yeah, but all the money in
the mother fuckin' world's

18:52.747 --> 18:55.310
not gonna stop somebody
that try to kill us,

18:55.310 --> 18:56.440
to take what we have?

18:56.440 --> 18:57.739
Hell no!

18:57.739 --> 19:00.310
Ain't nobody gonna take a
mother fuckin' thing from me.

19:00.310 --> 19:01.143
Nobody!

19:02.240 --> 19:03.508
- Calm down.

19:03.508 --> 19:05.750
We can worry about who's
leavin' and stayin' later.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.507
- It won't be a later.

19:07.507 --> 19:08.470
If he don't stop actin' like

19:08.470 --> 19:11.058
we can just stop supplyin' our people.

19:11.058 --> 19:14.880
Understand that this mother
fuckin' shit is for life.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.508
Our life.

19:16.508 --> 19:17.725
The moment we stop we
gonna have to fuckin'

19:17.725 --> 19:19.392
move away from here.

19:20.587 --> 19:24.015
Instantly it's gonna be a
target on us like never before.

19:24.015 --> 19:27.094
- Maybe movin' ain't such a bad idea.

19:27.094 --> 19:27.927
- Maybe.

19:29.045 --> 19:29.878
Maybe not.

19:32.806 --> 19:35.057
Only time can tell.

19:35.057 --> 19:37.557
(tense music)

19:44.025 --> 19:46.635
- Goddamn, how long these
mother fuckers gonna take, dog?

19:46.635 --> 19:49.337
- Man, they comin' dog, calm down.

19:49.337 --> 19:51.006
Everything can't be rushed.

19:51.006 --> 19:52.073
- Yeah, but everything can't

19:52.073 --> 19:54.854
take a lifetime, either, Patrick.

19:54.854 --> 19:58.243
Now these mother fuckers
don't wanna take our package?

19:58.243 --> 20:01.473
Then they ain't movin' nothin', my dog.

20:01.473 --> 20:03.534
As far as that old-ass nigger, Will,

20:03.534 --> 20:04.734
man, he been runnin' around the city

20:04.734 --> 20:05.945
like he own it for years.

20:05.945 --> 20:06.778
Don't you think it's about time

20:06.778 --> 20:08.193
we step up to the plate, dog?

20:08.193 --> 20:10.643
- (mumbling) my brother.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.810
Come on man, you gotta think.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.199
Think.

20:14.199 --> 20:17.471
He only one piece to the puzzle, dog.

20:17.471 --> 20:20.279
He ain't been out here
this long being weak.

20:20.279 --> 20:23.591
- I'll tell you one thing, though.

20:23.591 --> 20:26.319
It's a mother fuckin' war they want,

20:26.319 --> 20:29.050
then it's a mother fuckin'
war we gonna give 'em.

20:29.050 --> 20:31.111

where it all start, bro.

20:31.111 --> 20:33.028

20:35.042 --> 20:37.542

20:39.860 --> 20:40.820

20:40.820 --> 20:42.762

20:42.762 --> 20:44.372

20:46.772 --> 20:49.311
Everything gonna be just fine, all right?

20:49.311 --> 20:50.871
- If I was gonna be
fine, then what the fuck

20:50.871 --> 20:53.052
you got me in here for then?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.612
- I'll tell you what, hold up.

20:54.612 --> 20:57.112
(tense music)

21:02.130 --> 21:04.297
So I can make you a offer.

21:06.291 --> 21:07.842
- I listen a whole lot better

21:07.842 --> 21:09.612
when I'm not thrown in the trunk of a car

21:09.612 --> 21:12.663
with a fuckin' pillowcase
over my head, my nigger.

21:12.663 --> 21:14.812
- Listen here, nigger.

21:14.812 --> 21:16.703
What I'm gettin' ready to say to you,

21:16.703 --> 21:19.903
I need you to pay close
attention to me, you understand?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.903
'Cause what I'm gettin'
ready to say to you

21:21.903 --> 21:26.532
is very important to every
man standin' here today.

21:26.532 --> 21:29.042
- And who the fuck is y'all, man?

21:29.042 --> 21:29.875
- Me?

21:29.875 --> 21:32.971

and this model-looking

21:32.971 --> 21:34.591

21:34.591 --> 21:37.292

21:37.292 --> 21:38.812
And you sir,

21:38.812 --> 21:42.983
you happen to work for a
guy named Mr. Will, right?

21:42.983 --> 21:45.130
- Naw, I don't work for nobody.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.922
I'm my own boss.

21:46.922 --> 21:48.772
- I'm my own boss.

21:48.772 --> 21:51.022
(laughing)

21:54.602 --> 21:56.332
So, basically, what you sayin' is,

21:56.332 --> 21:58.631
what I'm sayin' to you
is correct, then, right?

21:58.631 --> 22:00.263
- [Jay] Correct, nigger.

22:00.263 --> 22:02.513
(laughing)

22:03.823 --> 22:05.092
- All right man, I'll tell you what.

22:05.092 --> 22:06.292
Check this out.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.792

22:10.072 --> 22:10.905
Ah!

You see this right here?

22:17.392 --> 22:18.554
Look at it, mother fucker!

22:18.554 --> 22:20.074
Do you see this right here?

22:20.074 --> 22:21.074
- Yeah, man.

22:21.972 --> 22:24.324
- Well, I'll tell you what.

22:24.324 --> 22:26.844
I want you to start movin' this for me.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.844
- What the fuck is that?

22:29.992 --> 22:31.772
- The same thing you move for Will,

22:31.772 --> 22:33.684

22:33.684 --> 22:36.802
- Man, I don't move shit

'Cause I see you think I'm playin'

22:42.884 --> 22:46.132

22:46.132 --> 22:48.783
So, I see you didn't take me serious

22:48.783 --> 22:52.983
when I said what I had to say
to you was very important.

22:52.983 --> 22:54.900
Hey, go grab them, man.

22:56.013 --> 22:59.594
Well, Pat, you got me

22:59.594 --> 23:02.095
(tense music)

23:02.095 --> 23:05.764
Goddamn, man, what the
fuck takin' so long?

23:05.764 --> 23:06.597
Fuck!

23:08.524 --> 23:10.154

23:10.154 --> 23:11.415

23:11.415 --> 23:12.754
What the hell is going on and who the fuck

23:12.754 --> 23:14.255

23:14.255 --> 23:15.847
- Man, what they doin' here, man?

23:15.847 --> 23:16.680
- [Lauren] Jay!

23:16.680 --> 23:18.735
(laughing)

23:18.735 --> 23:19.568
- Ah!

23:20.604 --> 23:22.521
Now, just imagine this.

23:24.044 --> 23:28.273
Here I am, giving you a
opportunity to make some money,

23:28.273 --> 23:29.793
and what do you tell me?

23:29.793 --> 23:32.423
You tell me to kiss your fuckin' ass!

23:32.423 --> 23:33.256
- Look, dog.

23:33.256 --> 23:35.025
I never said that.

23:35.025 --> 23:38.105
You got my full attention,
although, I get it.

23:38.105 --> 23:40.605
(tense music)

23:41.745 --> 23:44.173
- Well, just too bad I
ain't had your attention

23:44.173 --> 23:46.404
when we grabbed your ass.

23:46.404 --> 23:49.273
See now I can tell from
the look in your eyes,

23:49.273 --> 23:51.455

23:51.455 --> 23:53.524
So, I'ma try this shit again.

23:53.524 --> 23:55.273
Now, how many of them did
you say you could move

23:55.273 --> 23:56.364

23:56.364 --> 23:59.644
- Brah, I do 'bout
three, four a week, man.

23:59.644 --> 24:02.894
- Okay, good, now we gettin' somewhere.

24:03.924 --> 24:08.082
- I'm so glad you came to your right mind.

24:08.082 --> 24:09.513
I kinda wish you woulda did it

24:09.513 --> 24:13.603
when he told you how important
this business meetin' was.

24:13.603 --> 24:16.815
- Man, I seen how you got my
brother and my baby mama, man.

24:16.815 --> 24:20.673
You done proved your
little point, now I get it.

24:20.673 --> 24:23.055
- Think I need to show you,

24:23.055 --> 24:25.103
just so you fully understand.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.124
- Look, man.

24:26.124 --> 24:27.015
You ain't gotta show me shit--

24:27.015 --> 24:27.913
- Shut the fuck up.

24:27.913 --> 24:30.413
(tense music)

24:34.775 --> 24:36.452
What's your name, baby girl?

24:36.452 --> 24:37.743
- Lauren.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.295
- Lauren.

24:39.295 --> 24:40.823

24:42.675 --> 24:43.508

24:44.341 --> 24:45.316
- Leave her alone?

24:45.316 --> 24:48.095
- Man, what the fuck

24:48.095 --> 24:50.204
- Nigger, you shoulda left her alone.

24:50.204 --> 24:52.564
- [Jay] Man, what the fuck is going on?

24:52.564 --> 24:55.064
(tense music)

24:56.855 --> 24:58.394
- Come on, you two.

24:58.394 --> 25:00.894
Tell Jay where I got you from.

25:02.705 --> 25:04.783
- All right man, look, bro.

25:04.783 --> 25:06.057
Look man, I fucked up all right?

25:06.057 --> 25:06.890

25:06.890 --> 25:09.386

25:09.386 --> 25:12.586
- Oh man, I need some

25:12.586 --> 25:16.516
- Hey man, you can tell

25:16.516 --> 25:18.628

That shit true?

25:36.559 --> 25:39.476
- And the truth shall set you free.

25:41.310 --> 25:44.143
Unfortunately, somebody gotta die.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.310
And it gotta be one of y'all,

25:48.310 --> 25:50.947

25:50.947 --> 25:52.376
- What the fuck you talking about, man?

25:52.376 --> 25:54.436
- I mean, it's simple.

25:54.436 --> 25:57.638
One of y'all choose, or Jay gonna choose,

25:57.638 --> 26:00.471
but either way, somebody gotta go.

26:02.016 --> 26:02.849
- All right, come on, man.

Listen to me.

26:03.682 --> 26:04.515
Holler at your bro, man.

26:04.515 --> 26:05.886
Talk to your mans, man.

26:05.886 --> 26:07.888

26:07.888 --> 26:09.867
My brother up here fuckin' my baby mama,

26:09.867 --> 26:12.156

26:12.156 --> 26:13.827
- Let's shoot that nigger, man.

- Come on, man.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.547

26:15.547 --> 26:17.415
Man, I can explain all this shit, bro.

26:17.415 --> 26:19.441

26:19.441 --> 26:21.673

- Come on, man, please!

26:27.704 --> 26:29.271
(gunshot blasting)

26:29.271 --> 26:31.242
- Damn, hell yeah!

26:31.242 --> 26:32.075
I ain't gonna lie.

26:32.075 --> 26:33.962
I thought you was gonna shoot that nigger.

26:33.962 --> 26:34.795
(laughing)

26:34.795 --> 26:36.922
- I'd never kill my brother over no bitch.

26:36.922 --> 26:39.591
- Thanks man, go lookit.

26:39.591 --> 26:41.270
- [Cisco] Man, look at

26:41.270 --> 26:44.031
Y'all a little happy family now, huh?

26:44.031 --> 26:44.864
- [Jay] Yeah, but I don't take

26:44.864 --> 26:46.221
that disloyal shit either, nigger.

26:46.221 --> 26:47.071
(gunshot blasting)

26:47.071 --> 26:48.071
- Ooh, shit.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.669
- You might as well go
on ahead and kill me now,

26:50.669 --> 26:52.031
'cause everything I was
livin' for is layin'

26:52.031 --> 26:54.221
right there on that floor, my nigger.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.981
- What about your daughter?

26:55.981 --> 26:58.341
- My daughter died in her
sleep when she was one,

26:58.341 --> 26:59.471
so if you want me to work for you,

26:59.471 --> 27:01.122
I can't even fuck with it.

27:01.122 --> 27:03.490
I'm loyal to the niggers I roll with.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.442
- You sure?

27:04.442 --> 27:05.390
- Very.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.223
(chuckling)

27:06.223 --> 27:07.581
- Say the word, Pat.

27:07.581 --> 27:09.470
- All right, man.
- Say the word, Pat.

27:09.470 --> 27:12.870
- Fuck outta here, but make
sure you tell your boss

27:12.870 --> 27:15.141
he got another week before we move in.

27:15.141 --> 27:17.789
- It's not gonna be that easy, though.

27:17.789 --> 27:20.710
- Wouldn't have it no other way.

27:20.710 --> 27:22.130
- All right then.

27:22.130 --> 27:24.630
(tense music)

27:28.922 --> 27:31.071
- I got this, man.

27:31.071 --> 27:32.511
Don't worry.

27:32.511 --> 27:33.428
We're good.

27:47.642 --> 27:48.475
- Hi baby.

27:48.475 --> 27:50.141
How was school?

27:50.141 --> 27:51.490
- It was okay.

27:51.490 --> 27:53.501
I did good on my test.

27:53.501 --> 27:54.370
- You shoulda did good.

27:54.370 --> 27:56.271
I mean, you studied the whole weekend.

27:56.271 --> 27:58.831
- I know, but I was
still a little nervous.

27:58.831 --> 28:00.990
I don't think my teacher likes me.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.362
- Honey, you're not in
school for the teacher

28:02.362 --> 28:03.500
to like you, okay?

28:03.500 --> 28:04.333
You're there to learn.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.381
She has a degree and
you have to get yours.

28:06.381 --> 28:07.482
- I know, I know.

28:07.482 --> 28:09.181
She sent you a letter about the dance,

28:09.181 --> 28:11.210
but I threw it away.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.330
- Why'd you throw it away
if she sent it to me?

28:13.330 --> 28:15.151
- Because I don't want to go.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.762
It's the Daddy-Daughter
Dance and my daddy is dead.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.431
Why do I have to go?

28:19.431 --> 28:20.951
- Baby, you don't have to go,

28:20.951 --> 28:23.830
but don't throw things away
that are addressed to me, okay?

28:23.830 --> 28:25.450
- Okay, I won't.

28:25.450 --> 28:26.283
- [Maria] Okay.

28:26.283 --> 28:28.042
- How did my dad die?

28:28.042 --> 28:29.941
I heard he was murdered.

28:29.941 --> 28:31.621
- Where'd you hear that from?

28:31.621 --> 28:32.871
- Grandma Ella.

28:33.990 --> 28:35.381
- What else did she say?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.471
- She said my dad was a really nice man

28:38.471 --> 28:42.830
and someone killed him and
she's been sad ever since.

28:42.830 --> 28:44.951
- Well, your dad was a good man.

28:44.951 --> 28:46.941
Actually, he was a great man.

28:46.941 --> 28:48.750
He was the love of my life.

28:48.750 --> 28:51.050
He would have loved you so much.

28:51.050 --> 28:52.850
- How did he die?

28:52.850 --> 28:54.650
- Baby, I don't know.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.642
- Do you think Will can
take me to the dance?

28:57.642 --> 28:58.475
- Will?

28:58.475 --> 28:59.308
My cousin Will?

28:59.308 --> 29:00.290
- Yes.

29:00.290 --> 29:02.109
- Well, we're gonna ask Sean.

29:02.109 --> 29:03.861
- But Will is cooler.

29:03.861 --> 29:07.410
- Well, Sean's way more
responsible, so we're gonna ask him.

29:07.410 --> 29:08.490
- Okay.

29:08.490 --> 29:10.941
Will you get me a new dress?

29:10.941 --> 29:11.774
- Yeah, I will.

29:11.774 --> 29:13.290
We'll have a whole pamper day, okay?

29:13.290 --> 29:16.290
New dress, new shoes,
you'll be a princess.

29:16.290 --> 29:18.221
- I'm a princess every day.

29:18.221 --> 29:19.888
- Of course you are.

29:25.509 --> 29:27.101
- Ma, get up.

29:27.101 --> 29:28.090
Ma, get up.

29:28.090 --> 29:29.581
- What you need?

29:29.581 --> 29:31.242
- I need you to touch this for me.

29:31.242 --> 29:32.322
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a little money, too,

29:32.322 --> 29:34.242
to get you something to eat.

29:34.242 --> 29:35.650
Clean this place up.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.150
- Thank you, baby.

29:54.962 --> 29:55.962
- [Woman] Hey.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.042
- [Sean] Hey.

29:57.042 --> 29:57.875
- What are you doin' later?

29:57.875 --> 29:59.761
You wanna study?

29:59.761 --> 30:02.282
- You know, I'd rather go to dinner.

30:02.282 --> 30:05.791
- That would be nice, but
I gotta finish this work.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.181
You know, not everybody
has a rich mother like you

30:08.181 --> 30:10.400
that pays for their school.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.861
- Yeah, I understand that, but,

30:12.861 --> 30:15.901
you know, a little food
ain't never hurt nobody.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.061
I mean, not that you need anything.

30:18.061 --> 30:19.930
You know you look good.

30:19.930 --> 30:22.093
Just wanna take you to dinner.

30:22.093 --> 30:24.200
- I mean, that would be
nice to actually get out

30:24.200 --> 30:28.242
of the house and spend
some time with a grown up.

30:28.242 --> 30:30.413
I think that's probably
why I like school so much

30:30.413 --> 30:33.333
because I get some adult interaction.

30:33.333 --> 30:37.671
I think my daughters have
been my only date since...

30:37.671 --> 30:38.921
A lot of years.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.166
- Why is that?

30:42.059 --> 30:45.299
- I mean, ever since
their father was murdered,

30:45.299 --> 30:48.831
I haven't really wanted to go out.

30:48.831 --> 30:51.498
- What happened to their father?

30:53.671 --> 30:57.004
- Small time dealer and he owed some guy

30:57.900 --> 31:01.540
a few dollars and he killed him for it.

31:01.540 --> 31:02.373
- Wow.

31:03.839 --> 31:06.340
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:06.340 --> 31:09.340
So, how your little girls take that?

31:10.319 --> 31:12.099
- It's hard.

31:12.099 --> 31:12.932
I mean...

31:14.100 --> 31:16.399
You know, they start asking questions,

31:16.399 --> 31:21.031
some that I can answer,
some that I can't, like,

31:21.031 --> 31:24.948
what's his favorite food
or if he liked sports.

31:27.151 --> 31:30.959
I mean, my oldest one just
asked me the other day

31:30.959 --> 31:33.139
why God took her father,

31:33.139 --> 31:36.139
and I don't know how to answer that.

31:37.079 --> 31:37.912
- Well.

31:42.071 --> 31:44.480
- What got you smilin'?

31:44.480 --> 31:46.179
- Nothin', really.

31:46.179 --> 31:48.818
Actually, my cousin just
asked me if I could take

31:48.818 --> 31:51.669
her daughter to the Daddy Daughter Dance.

31:51.669 --> 31:54.720
- Mmm, well, where's her dad?

31:54.720 --> 31:57.053
- Well, just like your kids,

31:59.027 --> 32:01.939
he was murdered right before she was born.

32:01.939 --> 32:04.160
So, me and my brother kinda just

32:04.160 --> 32:08.000
been there for her ever since, you know?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.428
So, I can kinda understand
what you're going through.

32:11.428 --> 32:12.261
- Wow.

32:13.469 --> 32:16.608
It's so sad that these girls
have to go through this

32:16.608 --> 32:18.669
without the men in their
lives that are supposed

32:18.669 --> 32:22.169
to teach them what real love is all about.

32:23.349 --> 32:26.788
- Yeah, you right about
that in so many ways.

32:26.788 --> 32:29.705
Maybe one day we could change that.

32:32.208 --> 32:33.041
- How?

32:33.968 --> 32:35.149
- I don't know.

32:35.149 --> 32:37.389
How 'bout we talk about it over dinner?

32:37.389 --> 32:38.972
Where you wanna go?

32:39.888 --> 32:42.221
- Why don't you surprise me?

32:43.349 --> 32:44.760
But,

32:44.760 --> 32:46.192
hint.

32:46.192 --> 32:47.419
I like chicken.

32:47.419 --> 32:48.440
(laughing)

32:48.440 --> 32:50.200
- And who don't?

32:50.200 --> 32:52.501
- I'll text you my address.

32:52.501 --> 32:54.251
- Okay, I can't wait.

32:57.880 --> 32:58.713
- Sean.

33:00.181 --> 33:01.939
- What's up?

33:01.939 --> 33:02.939
- Thank you.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.917
- For what?

33:06.248 --> 33:08.920
- Just bein' a total gentleman.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.307
- Look, you don't even have
to thank me for being me.

33:11.307 --> 33:13.749
- That's good to know.

33:13.749 --> 33:15.840
Some of these guys are out here pretending

33:15.840 --> 33:18.507
to be somebody that they're not.

33:19.788 --> 33:21.579
See you tonight.

33:21.579 --> 33:22.662
- Can't wait.

33:25.539 --> 33:26.372
(thudding)

33:26.372 --> 33:27.340
- Okay.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.398
Okay.

33:28.398 --> 33:29.231
Okay.

33:32.556 --> 33:35.498
(grunting)

33:35.498 --> 33:37.748
(mumbling)

33:44.577 --> 33:45.428
- [Trainer] Good job.

33:45.428 --> 33:46.668
- Yeah.

33:46.668 --> 33:47.501
All right.

33:47.501 --> 33:48.334
- Good luck shadow boxing.

33:48.334 --> 33:49.167
- Okay.

33:49.167 --> 33:50.287
(clapping)

33:50.287 --> 33:53.120
(faint rap music)

34:00.476 --> 34:01.503
- Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

34:01.503 --> 34:02.336
- Excuse me.

34:02.336 --> 34:03.169
- Let me get out your way.

34:03.169 --> 34:04.114
- No.

34:04.114 --> 34:05.682
You're not in my way.

34:05.682 --> 34:06.515
(chuckling)

34:06.515 --> 34:08.023
I see you here all the time.

34:08.023 --> 34:09.762
Kinda wish you were in my way.

34:09.762 --> 34:10.862
- Really?

34:10.862 --> 34:11.783
- Yeah.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.902
- Well, thank you.

34:13.902 --> 34:15.302
What's your name?

34:15.302 --> 34:16.532
- Patrick.

34:16.532 --> 34:17.601
You are?

34:17.601 --> 34:18.994
- I'm Maria.

34:18.994 --> 34:20.074
- It's nice to meet you, Maria.

34:20.074 --> 34:21.862
- Nice to meet you, too.

34:21.862 --> 34:23.445
So, what do you do?

34:24.460 --> 34:25.641
- What you mean, for a living?

34:25.641 --> 34:26.475
- Yeah.

34:26.475 --> 34:27.972
What do you do for a living?

34:27.972 --> 34:29.311
- I'm in insurance.

34:29.311 --> 34:30.143
- Really?

34:30.143 --> 34:30.976
Insurance?

34:30.976 --> 34:32.300
- Yes.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.132
Insurance.

34:33.132 --> 34:34.219
You got insurance?

34:34.219 --> 34:35.732
- Yeah, of course I have insurance.

34:35.732 --> 34:36.565
- Well, how 'bout we go over

34:36.565 --> 34:38.732
your insurance policy over lunch?

34:38.732 --> 34:39.565
My treat.

34:41.404 --> 34:43.292
- Okay, sounds good.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.580
- Gimme your phone so I
can put my number in it.

34:44.580 --> 34:45.882
- I left my phone in the car, so,

34:45.882 --> 34:46.920
I'll just, I'll give you mine.

34:46.920 --> 34:47.753
- All right.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.851
There you go.

34:48.851 --> 34:51.685
(faint rap music)

34:57.482 --> 34:58.652
All right, I'm gonna call you.

34:58.652 --> 34:59.652
- All right.

35:01.452 --> 35:03.702
(thudding)

35:15.888 --> 35:16.721
- You got us out here.

35:16.721 --> 35:17.627
What's so important?

35:17.627 --> 35:19.848
- Man, we got a huge fuckin' problem, man.

35:19.848 --> 35:21.166
- What you mean, we got a problem?

35:21.166 --> 35:22.486
- Man, these niggers just kidnapped me,

35:22.486 --> 35:24.526
told me I gotta start
getting the bag from them.

35:24.526 --> 35:26.528
Saying y'all are running
the city over with.

35:26.528 --> 35:27.806
- What the hell you mean?

35:27.806 --> 35:29.066
- Man, like I said, bro.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.504
These niggers like to gig
us up and the only reason

35:31.504 --> 35:34.255
they let me go was to let y'all
know that it ain't bullshit.

35:34.255 --> 35:36.146
And they said we only got a week.

35:36.146 --> 35:37.117
- A week?

35:37.117 --> 35:38.005
Or what?

35:38.005 --> 35:40.546
- Be ready for whatever, my nigger.

35:40.546 --> 35:42.277
- You saying they just let you go?

35:42.277 --> 35:43.655
Man, that don't sound right.

35:43.655 --> 35:46.877
- So I could let y'all know
it was about to pop off.

35:46.877 --> 35:48.184
- They gotta be (mumbling).

35:48.184 --> 35:49.017
- Yeah.

35:49.017 --> 35:51.821
- Man, look, they had my
brother and my baby mama, dog.

35:51.821 --> 35:53.592
They both dead now.

35:53.592 --> 35:56.809
And that's why they let me go.

35:56.809 --> 35:59.750
- So they killed your
brother and your baby mama

35:59.750 --> 36:01.588
and let you go?

36:01.588 --> 36:03.470
- [Jay] I didn't say they killed 'em.

36:03.470 --> 36:04.303
I killed 'em.

36:04.303 --> 36:05.889
- The hell you mean, you killed 'em?

36:05.889 --> 36:07.500
- Man, like I said, dog.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.528
Come to find out they been fucking.

36:09.528 --> 36:11.798
The niggers that kidnapped
me did they little research,

36:11.798 --> 36:13.878
brought 'em to where I was at, then boom.

36:13.878 --> 36:15.588
The shit just got put
on the floor right then.

36:15.588 --> 36:16.918
- So, you killed 'em?

36:16.918 --> 36:18.548
- [Jay] Yes, man.

36:18.548 --> 36:20.668
- You killed your own
brother over a woman?

36:20.668 --> 36:22.249
- Man, hell no.

36:22.249 --> 36:23.528
I killed him 'cause he crossed me

36:23.528 --> 36:25.167
and I don't get down like that.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.047
Y'all should know that shit by now.

36:27.047 --> 36:28.927
I'm loyal to the people I fuck with,

36:28.927 --> 36:32.340
and that's why I'm allowed to
tell y'all we got a problem.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.580
- See what I mean?

36:34.580 --> 36:35.678
Jay, you good?

36:35.678 --> 36:37.845
- Hell naw, but I will be.

36:39.158 --> 36:40.198
- Lemme holler at my brother man.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.060
I'ma talk to you later,
let you know what's up.

36:42.060 --> 36:42.893
- All right.

36:42.893 --> 36:44.567
Just keep me posted, my nigger.

36:44.567 --> 36:47.067
(tense music)

36:48.078 --> 36:49.340
- See?

36:49.340 --> 36:50.740
Niggers want our spot.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.788
- Then let 'em have it, bro.

36:52.788 --> 36:55.708
Look, we too old to be fightin'
over these blocks, man.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.748
I already told you man, I'm done.

36:57.748 --> 36:58.886
- There you go.

36:58.886 --> 36:59.719
You done.

37:00.716 --> 37:02.076
It's easy for you to pick up and go

37:02.076 --> 37:04.276
because nobody knows your face.

37:04.276 --> 37:06.466
You and Maria, y'all been
able to collect a check

37:06.466 --> 37:09.045
while I been out here on the
mother fuckin' front lines.

37:09.045 --> 37:11.136
- Look, we all did our part.

37:11.136 --> 37:12.155
We all did our parts.

37:12.155 --> 37:14.764
Look, I'm sorry that your
face is the one that's known.

37:14.764 --> 37:16.736
But maybe that's a sign, bro.

37:16.736 --> 37:18.464
Maybe that's a sign that

37:18.464 --> 37:20.744
it's time for these new wolves
to take over these streets

37:20.744 --> 37:21.885
and we step back.

37:21.885 --> 37:24.024
- What else we gonna do, Sean?

37:24.024 --> 37:25.274
Start a mother fucking business?

37:25.274 --> 37:26.885
Open up a damn car wash or something?

37:26.885 --> 37:30.024
- Whoa, we got enough money
to do whatever we wanna do.

37:30.024 --> 37:32.675
I can help you figure it out.

37:32.675 --> 37:37.092
Look, bro, this city is ours
to do with as we please.

37:39.504 --> 37:41.754
- I'll think about it, man.

37:42.664 --> 37:46.224
We been on the street, I
don't see that happenin'.

37:46.224 --> 37:47.565
Ain't no nigger gonna take what we worked

37:47.565 --> 37:49.482
so hard to make happen.

37:51.576 --> 37:54.395
- Well, that's up to you, bro.

37:54.395 --> 37:56.875
I already told you, I'm done.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.625
(sirens blaring)

38:00.835 --> 38:02.918
It's time for us to grow.

38:17.220 --> 38:20.262
- When are we going shopping for my dress?

38:20.262 --> 38:21.095
- Oh, honey,

38:21.095 --> 38:22.900
(mumbling)
(phone ringing)

38:22.900 --> 38:24.131

38:24.131 --> 38:26.193
- [Michael] But I wanna go shopping.

38:26.193 --> 38:28.433
- Hold on, baby, let me take this.

38:28.433 --> 38:29.266
Hello?

38:29.266 --> 38:30.153
We can go shopping tomorrow.

38:30.153 --> 38:31.302
We'll go.

38:31.302 --> 38:32.192
- [Michael] Good.

38:32.192 --> 38:33.043
- Hi.

38:33.043 --> 38:35.542
- What's up, beautiful?

38:35.542 --> 38:36.833
- Nothin'.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.441
Just chillin'.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.274
- Okay.

38:40.342 --> 38:42.822
Hey, how 'bout you let
me cook for you sometime?

38:42.822 --> 38:44.291
- Can you cook?

38:44.291 --> 38:46.182
- Yes, I can cook.

38:46.182 --> 38:48.515
(chuckling)

38:52.292 --> 38:53.532
- Okay.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.320
- Shit, I mean, I'll
cook whatever you want.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.840
- All right, well, how 'bout chicken,

38:58.840 --> 39:01.532
the roasted chicken and
you can pick the sides.

39:01.532 --> 39:02.365
- All right.

39:02.365 --> 39:04.060
We can do that.

39:04.060 --> 39:06.551
I'ma text you the address where to come.

39:06.551 --> 39:08.372
- Okay, well how 'bout we meet at a park

39:08.372 --> 39:10.122
and we can eat there?

39:11.080 --> 39:14.732
- I really don't like eatin' outside.

39:14.732 --> 39:16.362
How 'bout you just come to my home?

39:16.362 --> 39:18.400
- I don't know about coming to your house.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.322
I don't really know you.

39:19.322 --> 39:21.300
You could be a serial killer.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.372
- What about this?

39:22.372 --> 39:25.092
How 'bout I rent us a room
and we can just eat there?

39:25.092 --> 39:25.925
- A hotel room?

39:25.925 --> 39:26.758
What kind of woman do you think I am?

39:26.758 --> 39:27.911
I'm not into that.

39:27.911 --> 39:28.744
- Oh my God.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.151
Well, look, I said a hotel room because

39:30.151 --> 39:32.812
it's a public and private place.

39:32.812 --> 39:35.972
So, if you scream, somebody'll hear you.

39:35.972 --> 39:37.903
- Okay, well you know
what, you got a point.

39:37.903 --> 39:38.736
(chuckling)

39:38.736 --> 39:39.823
All right.

39:39.823 --> 39:41.052
- I'ma call you tomorrow.

39:41.052 --> 39:42.170
- Okay, sounds good.

39:42.170 --> 39:43.842
You need me to bring anything?

39:43.842 --> 39:46.554
- Make sure you bring empty stomach.

39:46.554 --> 39:48.463
- Okay, I can do that.

39:48.463 --> 39:49.296
- All right.

39:49.296 --> 39:51.292
I'll send you the address tomorrow, baby.

39:51.292 --> 39:53.042
- Okay, sounds good.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.143
- Bye.

39:54.143 --> 39:54.976
- Bye.

40:02.479 --> 40:04.538
- Got my report card today.

40:04.538 --> 40:06.740
- Yeah boy, your moms told me.

40:06.740 --> 40:07.879
I'm proud of you, boy.

40:07.879 --> 40:08.712
- Thank you.

40:08.712 --> 40:11.351
- Damn, you remind me
so much of your uncle.

40:11.351 --> 40:12.184
- That's crazy.

40:12.184 --> 40:14.540
My mom said I remind her so much of you.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.249
No, said you used to be
real smart back in your day.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.460
- Shit.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.820
Naw, not like Sean.

40:20.820 --> 40:22.612
Sean was more than smart.

40:22.612 --> 40:24.449
He was better than me.

40:24.449 --> 40:27.220
He wanted more out of
life than I ever did.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.460
- Why you don't try to
be more like him then?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.300
- Because I'm me.

40:31.300 --> 40:34.489
I see things a lot
different than most people.

40:34.489 --> 40:36.820
- I think that's why my
mom said I'm more like you.

40:36.820 --> 40:37.991
You know, kids nowadays,

40:37.991 --> 40:40.824
they wanna be doctors and lawyers.

40:41.879 --> 40:43.935
I don't even like school, man.

40:43.935 --> 40:46.412
- Okay, so what do you wanna be?

40:46.412 --> 40:48.220
- I wanna be like you.

40:48.220 --> 40:49.951
Wanna move like you do.

40:49.951 --> 40:51.008
(melancholy music)

40:51.008 --> 40:52.635
- You don't wanna be like me, man.

40:52.635 --> 40:54.315
You wanna be better than me.

40:54.315 --> 40:56.037
So, you gonna have to go to school, man.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.008
That's why I do all I do.

40:58.008 --> 40:59.875
So, you can do what you wanna do.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.307
- Be real, though.

41:01.307 --> 41:03.677
You make more money than
all my friends parents'

41:03.677 --> 41:05.004
and you don't even got to get out the bed

41:05.004 --> 41:06.492
early in the morning.

41:06.492 --> 41:07.325
- That's not--

41:07.325 --> 41:08.158
- That's what I want!

41:08.158 --> 41:09.393
- Naw, that's not good, man.

41:09.393 --> 41:10.625
Do you know what I do?

41:10.625 --> 41:11.564
- Yeah.

41:11.564 --> 41:12.397
'Course.

41:12.397 --> 41:13.524
Everybody know.

41:13.524 --> 41:15.092
- Right.

41:15.092 --> 41:16.065
Well, if you end up doin' this,

41:16.065 --> 41:18.374
that means I didn't do my job.

41:18.374 --> 41:20.113
See, Rob, you're gonna
have to go to school man

41:20.113 --> 41:23.153
and be one of those things
that you don't wanna be.

41:23.153 --> 41:25.163
Or you can open up your own business,

41:25.163 --> 41:26.873
but son, this life is not what you think

41:26.873 --> 41:29.763
it's all cracked up to be.

41:29.763 --> 41:33.263
Shit, man, every day I walk outta my house

41:34.204 --> 41:37.324
and I don't know if I'm gonna return.

41:37.324 --> 41:39.865
That's not the life you want.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.545
You really don't.

41:41.545 --> 41:44.094
- So what makes it good for you, then?

41:44.094 --> 41:46.243
- I never said it was.

41:46.243 --> 41:48.225
It's just all I know.

41:48.225 --> 41:50.033
- And you all I know.

41:50.033 --> 41:51.450
I look up to you.

41:53.323 --> 41:56.065
- Man, you really wanna make me happy?

41:56.065 --> 41:57.398
Get your degree.

41:58.484 --> 41:59.817
I love you, boy.

42:01.164 --> 42:03.262
- I love you, too, Pops.

42:03.262 --> 42:07.022
- You're gonna tell me
later what you wanna be.

42:07.022 --> 42:08.605
- Already did, man.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.933
(tense music)

42:24.178 --> 42:25.011
- Yeah.

42:27.938 --> 42:29.447
So, how is it?

42:29.447 --> 42:31.947
(tense music)

42:41.356 --> 42:43.773
- Hey, Cisco, we got company.

42:46.165 --> 42:48.426
- Guess I'm gonna put you to sleep, mama.

42:48.426 --> 42:49.806
- Mom, how was it?

42:49.806 --> 42:51.007
The fuck going on here?

42:51.007 --> 42:54.007
(tense music)

42:54.007 --> 42:56.087
- [Cisco] Nothing you can handle, my man.

42:56.087 --> 42:57.004
- Mom, Mom!

42:57.996 --> 43:00.196
You hear me talking to you?

43:00.196 --> 43:02.266
Who the fuck are they?

43:02.266 --> 43:04.246
- That's right.

43:04.246 --> 43:06.913
You don't know who I am, do you?

43:08.218 --> 43:11.018
Well, allow me to introduce myself.

43:11.018 --> 43:15.826
I go by the name of Cisco,
and these two right here,

43:15.826 --> 43:18.076
these my homies, and you...

43:20.298 --> 43:22.826
You didn't get my message?

43:22.826 --> 43:23.946
I thought I told him to tell you

43:23.946 --> 43:27.178
you had a week to get the
fuck up out my hood, dog.

43:27.178 --> 43:28.282
- Your hood?

43:28.282 --> 43:30.364
Nigger, this is my mother
fuckin' neighborhood.

43:30.364 --> 43:32.516
(chuckling)

43:32.516 --> 43:35.516
(gunshots blasting)

43:36.746 --> 43:38.466
- Goddamn, nigger, did he hit you?

43:38.466 --> 43:40.436
- I'm good, you know?

43:40.436 --> 43:41.269
- Oh, shit, man.

43:41.269 --> 43:45.106
Come on, let's get the fuck up outta here.

43:45.106 --> 43:46.595
Hey, hey, hold, hold, hold, hold.

43:46.595 --> 43:47.578
(mumbling)

43:47.578 --> 43:48.495
Forgot man.

43:51.247 --> 43:52.727
Gotta make sure this bitch dead, too.

43:52.727 --> 43:56.447
(gunshot blasting)

43:56.447 --> 43:59.614
(faint uptempo music)

44:00.845 --> 44:03.965
- So you know you had me thinking
about you all day, right?

44:03.965 --> 44:04.798
- [Maria] Oh, really?

44:04.798 --> 44:05.631
- Yes.

44:05.631 --> 44:06.464
- Oh, yeah?

44:06.464 --> 44:07.716
- When are you gonna let me work you out?

44:07.716 --> 44:08.786
- Work me out?

44:08.786 --> 44:09.619
- [Patrick] Yeah.

44:09.619 --> 44:10.476
- What do you mean by that?

44:10.476 --> 44:12.527
- I mean, take you to my gym.

44:12.527 --> 44:13.796
- Oh, okay.

44:13.796 --> 44:14.978
Yeah, we could do it there.

44:14.978 --> 44:16.287
- Oh, we can do it?

44:16.287 --> 44:18.167
- Not, we can work out.

44:18.167 --> 44:19.236
(chuckling)

44:19.236 --> 44:20.906
- All right, I got you.

44:20.906 --> 44:23.044
- So, why aren't you married?

44:23.044 --> 44:24.916
- Okay, good question.

44:24.916 --> 44:28.236
I mean, to be honest with
you, I really don't know.

44:28.236 --> 44:29.807
The more I thought about marriage

44:29.807 --> 44:32.938
and walking down the aisle,
the more life got in the way.

44:32.938 --> 44:34.458
The more life got in the way,

44:34.458 --> 44:37.316
the more the thought of
marriage just faded away.

44:37.316 --> 44:38.578
What about you?

44:38.578 --> 44:40.367
Why aren't you married?

44:40.367 --> 44:41.887
- I don't know.

44:41.887 --> 44:45.885
I guess I never been willing
to just give anybody my heart.

44:45.885 --> 44:47.285
Don't get approached a lot.

44:47.285 --> 44:50.565
I just feel like men don't really

44:50.565 --> 44:52.732
want an independent woman.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.303
- It's not that.

44:55.303 --> 44:58.836
Maybe you just come off like
you don't need a man for shit.

44:58.836 --> 45:00.964
And usually, you know,
when a man feels like

45:00.964 --> 45:05.004
he's not needed or wanted, it get ghosts.

45:05.004 --> 45:06.506
- So you're saying I have to need a man

45:06.506 --> 45:08.106
in order for him to want me?

45:08.106 --> 45:09.636
- I'm not sayin' that.

45:09.636 --> 45:11.863
I'm just sayin' that, listen, you can be

45:11.863 --> 45:14.063
an independent woman without screaming it

45:14.063 --> 45:16.044
to the top of your lungs, my baby.

45:16.044 --> 45:17.144
- I'm independent!

45:17.144 --> 45:17.977
- No.

45:17.977 --> 45:18.810
Right,

45:18.810 --> 45:19.684
- [Both] Don't do that.

45:19.684 --> 45:20.615
(chuckling)

45:20.615 --> 45:22.334
- All right, you have a point.

45:22.334 --> 45:23.346
So, you did all of this?

45:23.346 --> 45:24.564
- [Patrick] I did.

45:24.564 --> 45:25.864
- Well, looks great.

45:25.864 --> 45:26.815
- Thank you.

45:26.815 --> 45:28.103
- [Maria] You cooked it?

45:28.103 --> 45:28.936
- I did.

45:30.224 --> 45:31.724
Have a seat, love.

45:33.124 --> 45:33.974
- Thank you.

45:33.974 --> 45:36.224
- [Patrick] You're welcome.

45:40.004 --> 45:42.671
(phone buzzing)

45:45.626 --> 45:47.959
(chuckling)

45:51.636 --> 45:53.734
- By the look of it,
must be a good message.

45:53.734 --> 45:54.836
- It actually was.

45:54.836 --> 45:55.669
(chuckling)

45:55.669 --> 45:56.502
- [Maria] Yeah?

45:56.502 --> 45:58.506
- We just closed on
another couple properties.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.066
- Oh, congratulations.

46:00.066 --> 46:01.036
- Thank you.

46:01.036 --> 46:02.226
- That's something to toast about.

46:02.226 --> 46:03.559
- [Patrick] Yes.

46:06.622 --> 46:08.955
(chuckling)

46:13.122 --> 46:15.622
(tense music)

46:16.822 --> 46:17.655
- Ma!

46:20.022 --> 46:22.092
(gasping)

46:22.092 --> 46:23.582
Bro.

46:23.582 --> 46:25.004
(gurgling)

46:25.004 --> 46:27.232
Bro, who did this, bro?

46:27.232 --> 46:30.312
(stammering)

46:30.312 --> 46:31.242
- Cisco.

46:31.242 --> 46:32.793
- Who the fuck is Cisco?

46:32.793 --> 46:34.392
Who?

46:34.392 --> 46:36.614
Who the fuck is Cisco, bro?

46:36.614 --> 46:37.462
I swear to God, bro.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.254
I can't lose you, too, bro.

46:39.254 --> 46:40.553
Come on, bro.

46:40.553 --> 46:42.193
Let me call somebody.

46:42.193 --> 46:44.753
(tense music)

46:44.753 --> 46:47.745
Yes, yes, can you send somebody?

46:47.745 --> 46:50.041
Send some, send somebody,

46:50.041 --> 46:51.458
210 Ashbury Park.

46:53.774 --> 46:56.454
My mother is dead and my
brother has been shot.

46:56.454 --> 46:59.374
- So, you never told me if
you like my food or not.

46:59.374 --> 47:01.162
- I did, you just didn't hear me.

47:01.162 --> 47:02.563
- Oh, okay.

47:02.563 --> 47:05.982
- My plate's clear and I
don't just eat anybody's food.

47:05.982 --> 47:09.342
- That's good, 'cause I
don't just cook for anybody.

47:09.342 --> 47:10.393
(chuckling)

47:10.393 --> 47:13.443
- Well, we're just special.

47:13.443 --> 47:15.110
- Yeah, you special.

47:16.273 --> 47:17.393
- Oh, you're being funny?

47:17.393 --> 47:19.171
- Naw, I'm serious.

47:19.171 --> 47:20.004
You're very special, love.

47:20.004 --> 47:20.837
(phone buzzing)

47:20.837 --> 47:21.670
- I have to take this call.

47:21.670 --> 47:23.041
Be right back.

47:23.041 --> 47:23.874
- Of course.

47:23.874 --> 47:27.041
(faint hip hop music)

47:29.739 --> 47:31.699
- Will been shot and my mama's dead.

47:31.699 --> 47:32.532
- Dead?

47:32.532 --> 47:33.958
What do you mean, she's dead?

47:33.958 --> 47:36.227
- I just left my mother's house.

47:36.227 --> 47:39.918
They takin' Will to
the hospital right now.

47:39.918 --> 47:42.278
I gotta find out who did this to 'em.

47:42.278 --> 47:43.699
- Are you okay?

47:43.699 --> 47:45.147
- I wish I was.

47:45.147 --> 47:47.299
(tense music)

47:47.299 --> 47:49.632
I ain't got my mama no more.

47:50.729 --> 47:53.518
And the way it look, Will
not gonna be here for long.

47:53.518 --> 47:54.351
- No, don't say that.

47:54.351 --> 47:55.419
He'll be fine.

47:55.419 --> 47:57.139
He'll be fine.

47:57.139 --> 47:58.806
- You ain't see him!

47:59.747 --> 48:01.807
- All right, what hospital
they takin' him to?

48:01.807 --> 48:03.307
(mumbling)

48:03.307 --> 48:04.929
All right, meet me there.

48:04.929 --> 48:06.046
- I can't.

48:06.046 --> 48:06.879
- Why not?

48:08.846 --> 48:11.089
- I can't see my brother die.

48:11.089 --> 48:13.267
I can't see him like that again.

48:13.267 --> 48:16.397
- All right, I'm headed there right now.

48:16.397 --> 48:18.387
- I don't think he gonna make it.

48:18.387 --> 48:19.627
- All right, look, it's
not over 'til it's over.

48:19.627 --> 48:21.779
I'll call you in a few, okay?

48:21.779 --> 48:23.086
(tense music)

48:23.086 --> 48:26.007
(sniffling)

48:26.007 --> 48:29.819
(faint uptempo music)

48:29.819 --> 48:30.689
- [Patrick] Is everything all right?

48:30.689 --> 48:33.379
- Yeah, everything's okay, I just...

48:33.379 --> 48:36.158
My babysitter, she had a family emergency,

48:36.158 --> 48:37.478
so, I gotta go.

48:37.478 --> 48:38.311
- Oh, no.

48:38.311 --> 48:40.147
You wanna pack any of this up for you,

48:40.147 --> 48:40.980
for you to take with you?

48:40.980 --> 48:42.397
- No, no that's okay.

48:42.397 --> 48:43.568
Why don't we just do it another night?

48:43.568 --> 48:44.728
We can do it all over again.

48:44.728 --> 48:45.746
- All right.

48:45.746 --> 48:46.579
Let's do that.

48:46.579 --> 48:47.586
- Thank you.

48:47.586 --> 48:48.608
- Just give me a call, all right?

48:48.608 --> 48:49.441
- Okay.

48:49.441 --> 48:50.274

48:57.486 --> 49:00.653
(faint hip hop music)

49:09.986 --> 49:12.736
(sirens blaring)

49:13.698 --> 49:15.845
- So, how you doin'?

49:15.845 --> 49:17.298
- Had better days.

49:17.298 --> 49:19.458
Hell, I'm sure everybody has.

49:19.458 --> 49:21.058
What's the doctor sayin'?

49:21.058 --> 49:24.044
- Basically, it's in
God's hands right now.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.367
- You know who did this?

49:26.367 --> 49:30.386
- This guy named Cisco
and his partner, Patrick.

49:30.386 --> 49:32.218
- You know where they're from?

49:32.218 --> 49:35.826
- No, I don't know where they from.

49:35.826 --> 49:36.659
I don't know what made 'em think

49:36.659 --> 49:39.204
they could try us like this.

49:39.204 --> 49:41.047
- Yeah, well look, lemme know if there's

49:41.047 --> 49:44.047
any change in his health, all right?

49:49.407 --> 49:52.725
- [Man] Yo, what time we meetin' tomorrow?

49:52.725 --> 49:53.698
- Oh shit, I don't know.

49:53.698 --> 49:54.531
You gotta ask Pat.

49:54.531 --> 49:56.098
He the one set that shit up.

49:56.098 --> 49:57.527
- Hey, we're gonna need
a lot more work now.

49:57.527 --> 50:00.236
I mean, we done got rid
of all the competition.

50:00.236 --> 50:01.887
- Man, what is you talking about, man?

50:01.887 --> 50:04.556
You act like we all
work alone or something.

50:04.556 --> 50:05.765
- It don't matter who you workin' with.

50:05.765 --> 50:07.205

50:10.503 --> 50:11.693

50:11.693 --> 50:12.634

50:12.634 --> 50:14.765
Hey, good job, bro.

50:14.765 --> 50:16.392

50:16.392 --> 50:17.405
- His mom's.

50:17.405 --> 50:18.813
(laughing)

50:18.813 --> 50:19.914
Naw, I'm sayin', listen.

50:19.914 --> 50:21.503
One of the workers told me this old lady

50:21.503 --> 50:23.383
that be comping from 'em, she ain't wanna

50:23.383 --> 50:25.703

50:25.703 --> 50:27.642
so he used to give her a morning fix.

50:27.642 --> 50:29.901
But then she told him that she wanted us

50:29.901 --> 50:32.482
to go meet with him, see
if he could hook us up

50:32.482 --> 50:34.533
with a better price.

50:34.533 --> 50:36.700
- Man, did she hook us up.

50:38.773 --> 50:39.606
Whoo.

50:40.572 --> 50:42.012
- So, where is he now?

50:42.012 --> 50:44.512
(tense music)

50:48.354 --> 50:49.354
- Who, Will?

50:50.423 --> 50:52.114
- Yes, Will.

50:52.114 --> 50:54.031
Where you put his body?

50:54.933 --> 50:55.914
- Naw, man.

50:55.914 --> 50:59.543
I dropped that mother fucker

50:59.543 --> 51:02.394
I put so many holes in that nigger,

51:02.394 --> 51:05.873
I guarantee you the message

51:34.703 --> 51:35.824

51:35.824 --> 51:37.324

51:39.506 --> 51:40.339
Holy shit.

51:40.339 --> 51:41.172

51:42.005 --> 51:43.520

51:43.520 --> 51:45.861
- Shit, how much you want for this?

51:45.861 --> 51:47.173

51:47.173 --> 51:48.006
Just give that shit away.

51:48.006 --> 51:49.672
- So generous.

51:49.672 --> 51:52.213
- [Man] All right, man.

51:52.213 --> 51:55.744
- Make sure you tell 'em

51:55.744 --> 51:58.493
(chuckling)

51:58.493 --> 52:00.773
- [Man] Hell yeah.

52:00.773 --> 52:03.273
(tense music)

52:05.773 --> 52:07.853
- [Maria] Hi, baby girl.

52:07.853 --> 52:10.131

52:10.131 --> 52:11.722
- Thank you so much for
keeping an eye on her.

52:11.722 --> 52:13.323
- No problem.

52:13.323 --> 52:14.156
Bye bye.

52:14.156 --> 52:16.672
- Thank you, see you.

52:16.672 --> 52:20.344
Hey, I need you to go
upstairs and pack a bag.

52:20.344 --> 52:21.852
- Where am I going?

52:21.852 --> 52:24.075
- You're gonna go over your granddad's.

52:24.075 --> 52:25.742
- Why, what's wrong?

52:26.794 --> 52:28.075
- Will got in a bad car accident,

52:28.075 --> 52:30.765
so I need your granddad to
take you to school tomorrow.

52:30.765 --> 52:33.405
- Is he going to be all right?

52:33.405 --> 52:36.165
- It was pretty bad, so we're not sure.

52:36.165 --> 52:39.136
- Can we pray for him
before I get my stuff?

52:39.136 --> 52:41.219
- Yeah, of course we can.

52:42.403 --> 52:46.136
- God in heaven, please
bless Will and make him okay.

52:46.136 --> 52:48.365
God, we love him and we want him

52:48.365 --> 52:50.948
to live a very long time, amen.

52:51.976 --> 52:53.003
- Amen.

52:53.003 --> 52:53.836
Okay, baby.

52:53.836 --> 52:55.714
So, run upstairs, get
your bag packed, okay?

52:55.714 --> 52:56.547
Oh, and don't forget your stuff

52:56.547 --> 52:58.256
for the Daddy Daughter Dance.

52:58.256 --> 53:00.845
- Sean's still taking me?

53:00.845 --> 53:02.445
- No, I'm gonna ask your granddad.

53:02.445 --> 53:04.984
- But you said Sean would.

53:04.984 --> 53:06.456
- Honey, I know I said that Sean would,

53:06.456 --> 53:07.914
but he needs to be with Will right now,

53:07.914 --> 53:10.744
so I don't think he's gonna be up for it.

53:10.744 --> 53:11.760
(cuckoo clock chiming)

53:11.760 --> 53:12.593
- Okay.

53:12.593 --> 53:13.426
- Okay, run up there.

53:13.426 --> 53:15.765
Get your bag together.

53:15.765 --> 53:16.682
Chop, chop.

53:17.896 --> 53:19.456
(knocking)

53:19.456 --> 53:20.421
- [Man] Yes, who is it?

53:20.421 --> 53:22.251
- [Maria] Maria.

53:22.251 --> 53:23.472
- [Man] What are you two doing here?

53:23.472 --> 53:25.312
- [Maria] If you let
us in, we'll tell you.

53:25.312 --> 53:27.240
- [Man] Oh, sorry, where are my manners?

53:27.240 --> 53:28.907
Come on in, pumpkin.

53:32.576 --> 53:33.409
How are you?

53:33.409 --> 53:35.099
It's so late, what are you guys doing out?

53:35.099 --> 53:37.979
- Mom said I have to
stay with you a few days.

53:37.979 --> 53:38.812
- Oh, is that so?

53:38.812 --> 53:39.730
What's going on?

53:39.730 --> 53:41.560
- Will had a bad car accident

53:41.560 --> 53:44.090
and Mommy has to go check on him.

53:44.090 --> 53:44.923
- Um, little girl.

53:44.923 --> 53:46.301
Lemme talk to your uncle.

53:46.301 --> 53:48.461
- Come on, let me take you
to your room for the night.

53:48.461 --> 53:49.294
- Okay.

53:49.294 --> 53:50.952
Is it a TV in there?

53:50.952 --> 53:53.301
- Of course, Granddad
put TVs in all the rooms.

53:53.301 --> 53:56.270
- Good, I can't sleep without a TV.

53:56.270 --> 53:57.251
- [Man] I swear she's been here before.

53:57.251 --> 53:58.502
- Yeah, she's an old soul.

53:58.502 --> 54:00.211
- [Man] Come on, let me
take you to your room.

54:00.211 --> 54:01.360
- Hey, will you grab Dad for me?

54:01.360 --> 54:02.193
- [Man] Yeah.

54:02.193 --> 54:03.026
- Just tell him I'll be on the couch.

54:03.026 --> 54:04.109
- [Man] Cool.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.683
But he not out the woods yet.

54:23.683 --> 54:25.933
- So, what you about to do?

54:27.310 --> 54:29.731
- 'Bout to go holler at Jay.

54:29.731 --> 54:32.190
- All right, make sure you

54:32.190 --> 54:33.822
- I will.

54:33.822 --> 54:35.211
- Hey, Sean.

54:35.211 --> 54:36.310
- What up?

54:36.310 --> 54:37.393
- Be careful.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.839
- Yeah, I will.

54:41.839 --> 54:43.006
- You promise?

54:44.600 --> 54:45.982
- I promise.

54:45.982 --> 54:47.482
- All right, cool.

54:58.199 --> 54:59.810
- So, what's goin' on?

54:59.810 --> 55:01.797
- Will didn't get in no car accident.

55:01.797 --> 55:05.297
They shot him up and they killed Aunt Bea.

55:08.170 --> 55:11.958
- Maria, I keep telling you,
the streets play for keeps.

55:11.958 --> 55:13.810
- Look, that's why I need
to keep a eye on Michael

55:13.810 --> 55:14.759
for a few days, all right?

55:14.759 --> 55:16.428
We gotta figure out what we gonna do.

55:16.428 --> 55:18.398
- What you mean, you gotta
figure out what you gotta do?

55:18.398 --> 55:22.269
What you need to do is
leave the streets alone.

55:22.269 --> 55:23.498
- We leavin' 'em alone.

55:23.498 --> 55:25.909
They won't leave us alone.

55:25.909 --> 55:29.159
- Look, it took your father a long time

55:30.119 --> 55:33.639
to leave that drug alone
you're out there sellin'

55:33.639 --> 55:36.677
and the worst thing of all,
it took your mother from me.

55:36.677 --> 55:39.108
- Oh my God, I'm not trying
to hear this right now.

55:39.108 --> 55:40.858
- That is a problem right there.

55:40.858 --> 55:42.439
You don't ever want to
talk about anything.

55:42.439 --> 55:43.639
- No, I did wanna talk about it,

55:43.639 --> 55:45.789
but you sent me to live with Aunt Bea.

55:45.789 --> 55:46.738
- I was all messed up.

55:46.738 --> 55:48.138
That drug had me gone.

55:48.138 --> 55:48.971
- Okay, well--

55:48.971 --> 55:49.978
- I ain't know if I was going or coming.

55:49.978 --> 55:51.359
- Well, I was going.

55:51.359 --> 55:53.050
And you wasn't there.

55:53.050 --> 55:57.250
- I am trying my damnedest
to make up for it now.

55:57.250 --> 55:59.018
- You can't change the past.

55:59.018 --> 56:01.530
We in the present, so
the only thing you can do

56:01.530 --> 56:03.879
is be a better grandfather to
that little girl over there

56:03.879 --> 56:07.138
than you was a father to
me and we're straight.

56:07.138 --> 56:09.178
- All right, I can do that.

56:09.178 --> 56:10.011
- All right, cool.

56:10.011 --> 56:10.928
I gotta go.

56:12.629 --> 56:14.629
- Listen, Maria.

56:14.629 --> 56:17.629
Baby, you do know I love you, right?

56:18.941 --> 56:20.578
- I know I needed to hear that.

56:20.578 --> 56:22.040
- Okay.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.058
- But look, before I forget.

56:24.058 --> 56:25.658
She has a daddy daughter dance all right,

56:25.658 --> 56:28.547
and I want to know if you can take her.

56:28.547 --> 56:29.427
- Really?

56:29.427 --> 56:30.909
Of course I can, that's my baby.

56:30.909 --> 56:32.728
- Yeah, her dress and

57:18.204 --> 57:20.297
- Come on, my nigger,

57:21.665 --> 57:24.124
It's six niggers in there and three women.

57:24.124 --> 57:26.115
The three women work there.

57:26.115 --> 57:27.606
- You holler out at JoJo, right?

57:27.606 --> 57:30.524

57:30.524 --> 57:33.606
He's sittin' on they ass

57:33.606 --> 57:35.286
I think that's they new spot,

57:35.286 --> 57:37.585
'cause he say they just

57:37.585 --> 57:40.235

57:41.985 --> 57:43.115

57:43.115 --> 57:44.937

We got to think what would Will do

57:51.377 --> 57:52.966

57:56.977 --> 57:58.105

57:58.105 --> 58:02.115
All I know is, the nigger's still alive.

58:02.115 --> 58:04.497
- And how you so sure about that, Jay?

58:04.497 --> 58:06.345
- 'Cause nigger, if he was dead,

58:06.345 --> 58:08.377
my phone would be slappin' right now.

58:08.377 --> 58:10.210
You already know that.

58:11.086 --> 58:13.075
- Yeah, you make a point right there.

58:13.075 --> 58:13.908
- Man, come on, man.

58:13.908 --> 58:15.537

- Okay, good.

58:33.166 --> 58:34.585
'Bout to head over there now.

58:34.585 --> 58:35.798
- Shit, if you going over there,

58:35.798 --> 58:38.225
I might as well go ahead and
run up in the other crib.

58:38.225 --> 58:40.417
They ain't gonna know what the
fuck they gettin' hit from.

58:40.417 --> 58:42.417
- No, no, don't do that.

58:43.366 --> 58:44.665
I got a better way.

58:44.665 --> 58:47.027
- Man, we need to hit these niggers now.

58:47.027 --> 58:49.137
- We only get one shot at this,

58:49.137 --> 58:51.536
and we gotta plan this shit out.

58:51.536 --> 58:52.666
Something tells me that these dudes

58:52.666 --> 58:55.235
is much more smarter than I think.

58:55.235 --> 58:57.246
They just waitin' us to hit 'em.

58:57.246 --> 58:59.406
- Man, think we need to go in

58:59.406 --> 59:02.016

59:08.483 --> 59:10.994
'Bout to send you the address to the crib.

59:10.994 --> 59:11.827
- Thanks.

59:13.995 --> 59:14.995
- How is he?

59:19.164 --> 59:21.224
- He's very lucky.

59:21.224 --> 59:23.475
Bullets missed his main organs.

59:23.475 --> 59:24.995
- So, is he gonna be all right?

59:24.995 --> 59:26.245
- I believe so.

59:27.314 --> 59:28.995
- Dr. Edwards, thank you so much.

59:28.995 --> 59:30.566
- Don't thank me.

59:30.566 --> 59:33.944
Thank that angel that was with him.

59:33.944 --> 59:37.216
- Now, we had to do a blood
transfusion in surgery.

59:37.216 --> 59:40.016
He lost a lot of blood,
but he's coming out of it.

59:40.016 --> 59:41.515
He's in recovery and you should be able

59:41.515 --> 59:43.824
to see him in a short
period of time, okay?

59:43.824 --> 59:44.754

59:44.754 --> 59:45.696
- All right, thank you.

59:45.696 --> 59:47.196
- Okay, thank you.

59:51.824 --> 59:54.074

01:00:00.455 --> 01:00:02.878
- Hey, what are you doing here?

01:00:02.878 --> 01:00:04.259
(chuckling)

01:00:04.259 --> 01:00:05.092
- [Cisco] Come on girl.

01:00:05.092 --> 01:00:07.467
You know I'm here to see your husband.

01:00:07.467 --> 01:00:10.656
- You're not here to see his sister?

01:00:10.656 --> 01:00:12.406
- Naw, I came to see you, too.

01:00:12.406 --> 01:00:13.239

01:00:13.239 --> 01:00:14.375
- What's up with my niece, man?

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.345

01:00:16.345 --> 01:00:17.455
You want me to go get her?

01:00:17.455 --> 01:00:18.487

01:00:25.407 --> 01:00:27.574
You haven't talked to her?

01:00:28.519 --> 01:00:29.687
- You know how she is, man.

01:00:29.687 --> 01:00:32.519
She can never get along with
both of us at the same time.

01:00:32.519 --> 01:00:33.599
- [Woman] Stop talking about my mama.

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:34.737
- That's my mama too.

01:00:34.737 --> 01:00:36.057
Now where you say that nigger at?

What you got for me?

01:00:54.657 --> 01:00:58.639
- Shit, them three spots open

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:00.948
I got security over there real heavy,

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.527
if you know what I mean.

01:01:02.527 --> 01:01:04.359
- All right.

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:06.229
You know what, I wanted

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:23.687

01:01:23.687 --> 01:01:25.618

but him and his mama.

01:01:25.618 --> 01:01:28.287
You took care of that shit.

01:01:28.287 --> 01:01:29.167

01:01:30.749 --> 01:01:32.469

No, man, we stick to the plan.

(melancholy music)

01:02:56.554 --> 01:02:58.554

01:03:05.464 --> 01:03:07.933
- I promise, I'm gonna take care of us.

01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:10.850
(melancholy music)

01:03:21.861 --> 01:03:23.694
- [Woman] Look at you.

01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:27.448
- Where's my mother?

01:03:29.082 --> 01:03:30.681

01:03:38.242 --> 01:03:39.242
- I'm sorry.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.120

I let my mom down.

01:03:56.186 --> 01:03:57.365
- You did not let her down.

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:00.605
Your mother knew what
she was doin' was wrong.

01:04:00.605 --> 01:04:02.772
(weeping)

01:04:06.085 --> 01:04:07.418
- My fault, man.

I was her protector, man.

01:04:13.696 --> 01:04:15.946
I was the man of the house.

01:04:18.663 --> 01:04:20.445
- She is your mother.

01:04:20.445 --> 01:04:21.914
You are not her father.

01:04:21.914 --> 01:04:25.293
God made her to protect you,
not the other way around.

01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:27.533
- They murdered her.

01:04:27.533 --> 01:04:28.554
- No.

01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:30.104
She put that needle in her arm.

01:04:30.104 --> 01:04:33.063
She knew that what she was taking.

01:04:33.063 --> 01:04:34.896
- I don't give a damn!

01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:37.862
All of 'em gonna pay.

01:04:39.034 --> 01:04:40.623
- I know, but you need to calm down.

01:04:40.623 --> 01:04:43.706
You can't get yourself all worked up.

01:04:44.925 --> 01:04:45.805

Sean, I don't think he's gonna make it.

01:05:17.155 --> 01:05:17.988

01:07:56.383 --> 01:07:57.613
I need to know.

01:07:57.613 --> 01:08:00.474
I have a daughter and I refuse
to bring her into any mess.

01:08:00.474 --> 01:08:01.765
She lost her father so I'll be damned

01:08:01.765 --> 01:08:04.133
if I let anybody just come
through with all of that.

01:08:04.133 --> 01:08:05.445

- No, I'm good, unless
the lady wants something.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:31.901
- I'm okay.

01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:33.282

but it'll be all right.

01:08:44.179 --> 01:08:45.179

01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:52.490
You sure you don't need anything?

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:53.831
- No.

01:08:53.831 --> 01:08:56.060

- Good, good.

01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:00.698
Thought I was gonna have
to whoop somebody ass.

01:09:00.698 --> 01:09:02.831
- Okay, well we don't need that, okay,

01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:04.991
but I'm glad you have my back.

01:09:04.991 --> 01:09:05.991

01:09:07.488 --> 01:09:09.178
So how 'bout we get outta here?

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.701
- And go where?

01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:11.533
- I don't know.

01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:12.450

01:15:10.991 --> 01:15:12.691
- I'll get it.

01:15:12.691 --> 01:15:13.524
- I got it, babe.

01:15:13.524 --> 01:15:14.357
Sit down.

01:15:23.011 --> 01:15:24.622
May I help you?

01:15:24.622 --> 01:15:26.840
- Is Patrick here?

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.911
- No, Patrick isn't home right now.

01:15:28.911 --> 01:15:30.312
How can I help you?

01:15:30.312 --> 01:15:32.812
(tense music)

01:15:35.142 --> 01:15:37.595
- I need to talk to Patrick.

01:15:37.595 --> 01:15:40.342
- Well, I'm Patrick's wife

01:15:40.342 --> 01:15:42.840
and he's not here, so, just let me know

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.451
what it is you need and
maybe I can help you.

01:15:45.451 --> 01:15:46.751
- No.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:48.168
I don't think so.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.151
- Well, you came to my house.

01:15:51.151 --> 01:15:52.152
Who are you?

01:15:52.152 --> 01:15:54.982
- Don't take this personal.

01:15:54.982 --> 01:15:55.815
- [Woman] What are you--

01:15:55.815 --> 01:15:56.680
(gunshot blasting)

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.841
- [Man] Yeah, though I walk

01:15:57.841 --> 01:15:58.950
through the valley of the shadow--

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:00.380
- Make him as sick as me.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.201
- [Man] I will fear no evil, none,

01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:04.046
for Thou art with me.

01:16:04.046 --> 01:16:06.686
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

01:16:06.686 --> 01:16:08.140
(mumbling)

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.307
(beeping)

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.093
- Sean.

01:16:18.961 --> 01:16:19.794
- Hey.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.480
Gonna be all right.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.730
- I don't know.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.280
He was doin' better yesterday than this.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.670
- So, what'd the doctor say?

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.840
- He said it's touch and go.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.673
But Will is a fighter.

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:39.851
- Yeah, I already know.

01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:41.027
- How are you holding up?

01:16:41.027 --> 01:16:43.909
(tense music)

01:16:43.909 --> 01:16:45.576
- I'm good, I guess.

01:16:47.749 --> 01:16:49.666
Just worried about him.

01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:52.974
Can't lose him like this.

01:16:55.341 --> 01:16:58.587
- Do you know who did this to him?

01:16:58.587 --> 01:17:00.170
- Yeah, I got idea.

01:17:01.011 --> 01:17:03.749
Working on taking care of that now.

01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:04.781
(tense music)

01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:06.698
- I hope you catch him.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:14.547
- Look, why don't you go
home and take a shower?

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.883
I'll sit here with him until you get back.

01:17:18.883 --> 01:17:21.163
- I would, but I wanna be the first face

01:17:21.163 --> 01:17:24.013
he sees when he wakes up.

01:17:24.013 --> 01:17:25.093
- You don't wanna be smellin' bad

01:17:25.093 --> 01:17:27.328
when he wakes up, either.

01:17:27.328 --> 01:17:29.745
- Shut up, Sean, I'm serious.

01:17:30.781 --> 01:17:32.811
- Look, I'm serious, too.

01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:36.811
Look, all I'm sayin' is,
you need a break, okay?

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:40.691
And besides, I'm here now.

01:17:40.691 --> 01:17:41.524
- Okay.

01:17:43.401 --> 01:17:46.229
- Hey, so I'ma have Bear
take you home, all right?

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:47.062
- Why?

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:48.145
I'll be okay.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.460
- I understand that, but I would rather

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.749
you take him with you and not need him,

01:17:53.749 --> 01:17:57.860
than to not take him with you
and he not be there for you.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.051
Okay?

01:17:59.051 --> 01:17:59.884
- Okay.

01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:05.314
(beeping)
(sighing)

01:18:15.611 --> 01:18:17.501
- Come on, bro.

01:18:17.501 --> 01:18:19.084
Gotta be all right.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.229
You all I got left, huh?

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:29.280
Them mother fuckers took Mama, bro.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.447
I can't lose you too, bro.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.947
Look, bro, I know I ain't
been there for you, bro,

01:18:36.947 --> 01:18:39.614
like I need to be, but I promise

01:18:41.691 --> 01:18:43.829
if you make it through this,

01:18:43.829 --> 01:18:46.412
bro, I'd never leave your side.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.520
I understand, bro.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.740
I understand everything now.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.907
(beeping)

01:19:06.933 --> 01:19:10.461
(sighing heavily)

01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:14.651
Please God, don't take my brother from me.

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:15.568
I need him.

01:19:28.548 --> 01:19:29.519
- Look at you.

01:19:29.519 --> 01:19:33.668
You are going to be the most
beautiful girl at the dance.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.501
- Thank you.

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:37.499
Is my mom going to make
it before we leave?

01:19:37.499 --> 01:19:39.319
- You know, your mom's
gonna do everything she can

01:19:39.319 --> 01:19:40.819
to be here, right?

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.367
- What do my mom do?

01:19:44.219 --> 01:19:46.519
- What you mean, what's your mom do?

01:19:46.519 --> 01:19:49.249
- I mean, I heard so much from my cousins.

01:19:49.249 --> 01:19:52.519
They say my dad was a big time drug dealer

01:19:52.519 --> 01:19:55.119
and my mother took over his drug business

01:19:55.119 --> 01:19:58.049
and that's why my
grandmother don't like her

01:19:58.049 --> 01:20:01.548
because she never shared
any of the money with them.

01:20:01.548 --> 01:20:03.740
- Don't believe what people say.

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:06.508
People make up stuff all
the time, you hear me?

01:20:06.508 --> 01:20:07.959
Unless it's coming from the person

01:20:07.959 --> 01:20:11.420
they're talking about,
act like it's not true.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.836
Listen, I'ma run upstairs

01:20:12.836 --> 01:20:14.257
and finished gettin' dressed, okay?

01:20:14.257 --> 01:20:15.148
Come here, baby, come here.

01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:16.377
You know I love you.

01:20:16.377 --> 01:20:17.777
Come here.

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:20.027
(grunting)

01:20:21.607 --> 01:20:24.107
(tense music)

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:31.236
- They killed my best friend?

01:20:31.236 --> 01:20:34.787
I'm the one who put y'all together.

01:20:34.787 --> 01:20:36.457
Tell you this.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:39.017
I'm killin' every mother
fucker associated with 'em,

01:20:39.017 --> 01:20:40.517
you understand me?

01:20:42.177 --> 01:20:44.677
- It had to be Will's brother.

01:20:45.577 --> 01:20:46.947
- What?

01:20:46.947 --> 01:20:48.187
You sure?

01:20:48.187 --> 01:20:50.977
- Who else could it have been, man?

01:20:50.977 --> 01:20:54.747
This whole fuckin' team's coppin' from us.

01:20:54.747 --> 01:20:57.476
- Yeah, but for how long?

01:20:57.476 --> 01:20:59.087
Shit, now they gonna think they can do

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.554
whatever the hell they wanna do.

01:21:01.554 --> 01:21:04.079
Shit, they done already struck back.

01:21:04.079 --> 01:21:06.700
- What make you think that?

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.168
Will can't leave the hospital.

01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:11.668
- I hope you right about that.

01:21:13.888 --> 01:21:15.846
- My home girl that
work over there told me

01:21:15.846 --> 01:21:19.096
that dog had a heart attack last night.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.760
- Straight up?

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.159
- Yes.

01:21:23.159 --> 01:21:25.659
(tense music)

01:21:31.982 --> 01:21:34.718
- I guess Mom not going to make it.

01:21:34.718 --> 01:21:36.431
- Well, we'll just have to
send her a lot of photos

01:21:36.431 --> 01:21:38.662
to make it feel like she was here.

01:21:38.662 --> 01:21:40.431
- It's not the same.

01:21:40.431 --> 01:21:42.672
- I know, pumpkin.

01:21:42.672 --> 01:21:43.505
You know what?

01:21:43.505 --> 01:21:44.338
I have an idea.

01:21:44.338 --> 01:21:45.630
Give me your phone.

01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:47.021
- Why?

01:21:47.021 --> 01:21:49.560
- We're about to send her
a thousand photos, come on.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.393
- Okay.

01:21:58.859 --> 01:22:00.859
- [Man] Beautiful niece.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.250
- What are you two doin'?

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.379
- We were just about to
send you a bunch of photos.

01:22:08.379 --> 01:22:09.212
- Aw.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:11.492
Hi.

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:15.299
- I'm so glad you're here.

01:22:15.299 --> 01:22:16.390
How do I look?

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.139
- Just like a princess, of course.

01:22:19.139 --> 01:22:20.130
Do a spin for me.

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:21.213
Wanna see ya.

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.863
Aw.

01:22:26.057 --> 01:22:26.890
- Ma?

01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:27.723
- [Maria] Hmm?

01:22:27.723 --> 01:22:28.730
- What's that on your face?

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:30.920
It looks like blood.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.753
- I don't know.

01:22:31.753 --> 01:22:32.586
I'll be right back.

01:22:32.586 --> 01:22:33.419
Wanna go see.

01:22:33.419 --> 01:22:35.179
Finish taking your pictures.

01:22:35.179 --> 01:22:37.679
(tense music)

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:46.017
- [Man] Hey, you okay?

01:22:46.017 --> 01:22:47.434
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:50.169 --> 01:22:52.009
- Where's that blood from?

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:52.842
- I don't know.

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.428
I must have cut myself or something.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.697
- You know Dad's worried about you, right?

01:22:56.697 --> 01:22:57.708
- Well, he don't have
to be worried about me.

01:22:57.708 --> 01:22:58.729
I'm fine.

01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:59.812
- How's Will?

01:23:00.849 --> 01:23:03.628
- He still ain't out the woods yet.

01:23:03.628 --> 01:23:04.617
- How's it lookin'?

01:23:04.617 --> 01:23:06.508
- Bro, come on.

01:23:06.508 --> 01:23:07.377
- Don't bro me, I'm asking you.

01:23:07.377 --> 01:23:08.210
How's it lookin'?

01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.043
- He ain't lookin' good.

01:23:09.043 --> 01:23:11.881
They don't think he's gonna make it.

01:23:11.881 --> 01:23:12.714
- I'm sorry about that.

01:23:12.714 --> 01:23:14.121
Whatever's meant to be'll be.

01:23:14.121 --> 01:23:15.871
- Yeah, you're right.

01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:26.338
Now, back to you.

01:23:27.481 --> 01:23:30.148
I rushed here to give you these.

01:23:32.692 --> 01:23:33.702
Your dad bought them for me.

01:23:33.702 --> 01:23:36.711
They were the very first
gift he ever got me,

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:37.941
and now they're yours.

01:23:37.941 --> 01:23:39.980
- Thank you so much.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.932
- You're welcome, babe.

01:23:41.932 --> 01:23:43.710
Hey, can you run upstairs and get Dad

01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:45.132
so they can get outta here?

01:23:45.132 --> 01:23:45.965
- Yeah.

01:23:45.965 --> 01:23:46.798
- I'ma sit here for a second.

01:23:46.798 --> 01:23:47.881
- [Man] Cool.

01:23:58.252 --> 01:24:00.252
(squeaking)

01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:01.393
- [Patrick] Ready to go?

01:24:01.393 --> 01:24:02.310
- Go where?

01:24:04.135 --> 01:24:05.655
- I don't know.

01:24:05.655 --> 01:24:09.076
I was thinking, maybe your aunt's house.

01:24:09.076 --> 01:24:11.996
- Okay, but I don't want
you to leave me there.

01:24:11.996 --> 01:24:13.264
- What you mean?

01:24:13.264 --> 01:24:14.337
- I don't want you to leave me again.

01:24:14.337 --> 01:24:16.105
I don't want anything to happen to you.

01:24:16.105 --> 01:24:17.945
- Baby, nothing's gonna happen to me.

01:24:17.945 --> 01:24:21.926
- Promise me you won't leave me there.

01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:22.926
- I promise.

01:24:30.895 --> 01:24:33.537
(sighing heavily)

01:24:33.537 --> 01:24:34.467
- Look, cuz, I'm about to start

01:24:34.467 --> 01:24:36.377
hitting these streets harder.

01:24:36.377 --> 01:24:38.788
No longer will my brother
have to suffer the backlash

01:24:38.788 --> 01:24:40.399
of being the face of this team.

01:24:40.399 --> 01:24:42.307
- I don't think it's a good idea.

01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:45.508
We need to put people in
place so we can move easier.

01:24:45.508 --> 01:24:48.727
The less we're seen, the more we can do.

01:24:48.727 --> 01:24:51.047
- I understand that, but I'm not about

01:24:51.047 --> 01:24:53.799
to sit back and let shit
else happen to my brother.

01:24:53.799 --> 01:24:55.679
- So, you're just gonna
give up on your dreams?

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:56.868
You said this was your last summer,

01:24:56.868 --> 01:24:58.627
so make it your last summer, Sean.

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:01.257
(tense music)

01:25:01.257 --> 01:25:03.407
- But they hit us!

01:25:03.407 --> 01:25:04.959
And I can't let that shit ride.

01:25:04.959 --> 01:25:06.596
- I'm not sayin' you have to.

01:25:06.596 --> 01:25:09.907
But there has to be a better way.

01:25:09.907 --> 01:25:12.737
- Well, I'm sure that better
way is out the window now.

01:25:12.737 --> 01:25:14.847
They not just gonna stop.

01:25:14.847 --> 01:25:16.367
You forgot we hit them?

01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:18.607
- They don't know it was you that hit 'em.

01:25:18.607 --> 01:25:20.827
- I'm sure they know it was us.

01:25:20.827 --> 01:25:23.196
I'm sure they know somebody
from our crew hit them.

01:25:23.196 --> 01:25:24.817
- They don't know it's us from the crew.

01:25:24.817 --> 01:25:28.467
They don't even know we are the crew.

01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:30.607
They think Will messin'
with a street family,

01:25:30.607 --> 01:25:32.274
not his real family.

01:25:33.697 --> 01:25:36.857
- So you don't think they think it's me?

01:25:36.857 --> 01:25:39.440
- I think we plan like they do.

01:25:41.468 --> 01:25:43.468
- So, what you thinkin'?

01:25:44.887 --> 01:25:47.024
- This is what I'm thinkin'.

01:25:47.024 --> 01:25:48.857
- [Woman] Look at her.

01:25:52.654 --> 01:25:55.555
- Now what the fuck am I supposed to do?

01:25:55.555 --> 01:25:57.374
They came to my home!

01:25:57.374 --> 01:25:58.624
- Who are they?

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.763
- It had to be Will people.

01:26:01.763 --> 01:26:02.596
- Will?

01:26:02.596 --> 01:26:04.523
- [Patrick] Yes, Will.

01:26:04.523 --> 01:26:07.534
He had the whole city on lock.

01:26:07.534 --> 01:26:09.025
- Where is he at, then?

01:26:09.025 --> 01:26:11.094
- He in the hospital.

01:26:11.094 --> 01:26:12.915
I thought we killed his ass.

01:26:12.915 --> 01:26:15.603
- How the hell do you not get that right?

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:18.323
The easiest thing for
a killer to do is kill.

01:26:18.323 --> 01:26:20.614
And you mean to tell me you
can't get that shit right?

01:26:20.614 --> 01:26:22.243
- I know Von.

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:23.076
Fuck!

01:26:24.235 --> 01:26:26.374
And now my wife is dead.

01:26:26.374 --> 01:26:29.523
And I don't even know who the fuck did it.

01:26:29.523 --> 01:26:31.185
Meanwhile, this nigger's
sittin' in the hospital

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:34.123
about to die and the only
people that been there

01:26:34.123 --> 01:26:38.225
to see him is his baby
mama and his brother.

01:26:38.225 --> 01:26:39.694
- So kill all of 'em.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.395
That way you kill the right one.

01:26:41.395 --> 01:26:42.243
- Kill all of who?

01:26:42.243 --> 01:26:44.064
- Anyone that's in his crew!

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:45.614
Kill the whole fucking crew!

01:26:45.614 --> 01:26:46.447
- It ain't that easy.

01:26:46.447 --> 01:26:47.530
- Yes, it is!

01:26:50.123 --> 01:26:52.353
- You got that poor girl murdered.

01:26:52.353 --> 01:26:55.014
And look at that
beautiful girl over there.

01:26:55.014 --> 01:26:57.923
Her life'll never be the same.

01:26:57.923 --> 01:27:00.473
And this shit is all your fault.

01:27:00.473 --> 01:27:03.734
You never allow anybody
to touch your family.

01:27:03.734 --> 01:27:07.381
You and Cisco, y'all need
to get this shit together.

01:27:07.381 --> 01:27:10.382
Now, your uncle is sending a
shipment here in two weeks.

01:27:10.382 --> 01:27:12.691
We don't need these problems.

01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:14.030
- We gonna to war with a bunch of niggers

01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:15.830
and don't even know who the fuck they are.

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.931
- Boy, get it together and fix this shit.

01:27:18.931 --> 01:27:22.221
Remember what, you were
made for this position.

01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:23.611
Remember when you killed Mike?

01:27:23.611 --> 01:27:24.491
Huh?

01:27:24.491 --> 01:27:25.833
Remember that?

01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:29.382
You killed him because he
wanted to stop supplying us.

01:27:29.382 --> 01:27:30.742
Hell, you know how many a nigger's

01:27:30.742 --> 01:27:33.753
tried to kill that
mother fucker and failed?

01:27:33.753 --> 01:27:35.222
But baby, you did it.

01:27:35.222 --> 01:27:36.473
You did it.

01:27:36.473 --> 01:27:38.993
Now, if you can handle
killin' that nigger,

01:27:38.993 --> 01:27:40.826
you can handle anyone.

01:27:41.721 --> 01:27:44.011
- That shit was easy.

01:27:44.011 --> 01:27:45.178
He trusted us.

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:50.593
This is a whole nother ball game.

01:27:50.593 --> 01:27:52.161
You know what?

01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:56.091
Mike told me, he said,
"Pat, you never let a nigger

01:27:56.091 --> 01:27:57.924
"know where you live."

01:27:59.433 --> 01:28:00.766
And I fucked up.

01:28:03.401 --> 01:28:04.401
I fucked up!

01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:07.801
- Well, do something about it.

01:28:07.801 --> 01:28:08.634
- Okay.

01:28:10.741 --> 01:28:13.222
- Go ahead and do what you need to do.

01:28:13.222 --> 01:28:15.472
I'ma take care of the baby.

01:28:24.891 --> 01:28:25.974
- Love y'all.

01:28:27.661 --> 01:28:28.578
- Love you.

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:37.793
- Hey, Von.

01:28:37.793 --> 01:28:39.142
- Hey, baby.

01:28:39.142 --> 01:28:40.771
- [Woman] Hey.

01:28:40.771 --> 01:28:41.604
You okay?

01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:47.571
- Yeah, I'm okay, but I ain't gonna lie.

01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:49.491
I ain't restin' until I
find the mother fucker

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:50.991
who did this shit.

01:28:52.062 --> 01:28:54.895
- Y'all need to handle this, okay?

01:28:55.771 --> 01:28:57.188
- Okay, I got it.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:02.630
- Well, looks like you got your wish.

01:29:02.630 --> 01:29:04.041
- What are you talking about?

01:29:04.041 --> 01:29:05.131
- We ain't leavin'.

01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:05.964
- Really?

01:29:06.971 --> 01:29:08.370
What changed your mind?

01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:09.262
- Will got shot and we don't know

01:29:09.262 --> 01:29:10.980
if he's gonna make it.

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:13.790
Michelle wants to take over
the family business, so

01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:15.130
looks like we're in.

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:16.822
- That's really good news.

01:29:16.822 --> 01:29:19.989
Not about Will, but about you staying.

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.150
- [Maria] Look, we need you to understand

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:24.921
that it's about to get really crazy.

01:29:24.921 --> 01:29:26.681
- [Man] Well, you've been a smart woman.

01:29:26.681 --> 01:29:28.830
I'm sure you'll be able to handle it.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:29.931
- [Maria] It's already handled.

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:30.971
- Good.

01:29:30.971 --> 01:29:33.571
I'll see you in a few days and we can

01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:34.738
go from there.

01:29:36.622 --> 01:29:38.411
Did you know

01:29:38.411 --> 01:29:40.982
you're the first lady I
ever did business with?

01:29:40.982 --> 01:29:42.310
- No, I didn't know that.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:46.419
Mike always said you're the
only white guy we can trust.

01:29:46.419 --> 01:29:48.382
I know he made you a lot of money,

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:50.262
but not like the money I'm gonna make you.

01:29:50.262 --> 01:29:52.182
- I believe that.

01:29:52.182 --> 01:29:54.682
(tense music)

01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:58.703
- Hello?

01:30:00.182 --> 01:30:02.330
- You all right?

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.663
- Yeah, and you?

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:06.131
- I'm all right.

01:30:06.131 --> 01:30:08.131
Just had a long ass day.

01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:10.711
- What's going on?

01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:16.062
- I just lost a close family member.

01:30:16.062 --> 01:30:18.691
- Yeah, I lost a lot of
people close to me, too.

01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:19.608
- Oh, yeah?

01:30:21.881 --> 01:30:24.101
How did you deal with it?

01:30:24.101 --> 01:30:26.022
- You never really get over it.

01:30:26.022 --> 01:30:28.833
You just learn to deal
with it a lot better.

01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:31.291
- Oh, man, I understand that.

01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:36.171
Hey but look, I ain't gonna be
able to see you for a while.

01:30:36.171 --> 01:30:37.481
- That's cool, I understand.

01:30:37.481 --> 01:30:38.481
That's fine.

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.851
Patrick, can I ask you something?

01:30:41.851 --> 01:30:45.291
- Yeah, baby, you can ask me anything.

01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:48.011
- What do you really do for a living?

01:30:48.011 --> 01:30:49.753
- What you mean?

01:30:49.753 --> 01:30:51.621
- What do you do?

01:30:51.621 --> 01:30:55.788
- What's, look, I done
already told you what's up.

01:30:56.721 --> 01:30:58.993
Hey, hold on one second.

01:30:58.993 --> 01:31:00.410
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:31:02.633 --> 01:31:03.841
- Hey, what's up, baby?

01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:05.581
- You promised you wouldn't leave me here.

01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:08.017
- Dani, listen, I just had to
make a quick run, that's it.

01:31:08.017 --> 01:31:08.881
- No, you promised.

01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:09.714
Come back.

01:31:11.371 --> 01:31:12.550
- All right.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.550
Here I come.

01:31:16.601 --> 01:31:17.434
Hello?

01:31:17.434 --> 01:31:18.510
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:20.531
- So, what's up with all the questions?

01:31:20.531 --> 01:31:23.091
- I just like to know
who I'm dealing with.

01:31:23.091 --> 01:31:26.022
- Well look, I been dealing
with a lot of shit today.

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.161

01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:34.603
- Naw, I really don't feel
like talking about it.

01:31:34.603 --> 01:31:36.961
- Cool, I understand.

01:31:36.961 --> 01:31:39.331
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:40.411
- Yeah.

01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:42.411
(tense music)

01:31:42.411 --> 01:31:43.291

- Yeah.

01:31:54.344 --> 01:31:56.085
But we gotta go get Dani.

01:31:56.085 --> 01:31:56.918
- Why?

01:31:58.194 --> 01:32:01.565
- 'Cause man, she ain't ready to be alone.

01:32:01.565 --> 01:32:02.643
- Man, she there with Lavon.

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:04.034
What you mean, she ain't good?

01:32:04.034 --> 01:32:05.623
- She good.

01:32:05.623 --> 01:32:07.040
She just worried.

01:32:08.063 --> 01:32:10.453
And I can't even blame her.

01:32:10.453 --> 01:32:12.213
Somebody would kill her mama

01:32:12.213 --> 01:32:14.046
and now they after us.

01:32:15.362 --> 01:32:16.279
- Look man.

01:32:17.762 --> 01:32:18.802
I don't know how you feel,

01:32:18.802 --> 01:32:21.354
'cause that was your wife and shit,

01:32:21.354 --> 01:32:24.173
but nigger, that was my sister.

01:32:24.173 --> 01:32:25.933
And I ain't gonna rest until the person

01:32:25.933 --> 01:32:28.594
that did this shit is
laid out, you feel me?

01:32:28.594 --> 01:32:30.302
- Yeah, man, that's cool and all,

01:32:30.302 --> 01:32:32.904
but that ain't gonna bring her back.

01:32:32.904 --> 01:32:35.149
My daughter ain't gonna never be the same

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.816
after seeing her mama like that.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.328
- I think we should kill
that nigger brother, man.

01:32:43.328 --> 01:32:44.161
- Yeah.

01:32:45.188 --> 01:32:46.909
But first we gotta handle this business.

01:32:46.909 --> 01:32:48.670
- Shit, that should be the first part

01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.837
of the business we handle.

01:32:53.670 --> 01:32:56.608
- We gotta get everybody on
the same page, all right?

01:32:56.608 --> 01:32:57.739
Right.
