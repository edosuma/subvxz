00:03.598 --> 00:05.338
Hey, Sammy.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.834
Look what I got for you, pal.

00:09.053 --> 00:11.297
I got you a new spaceship.

00:11.298 --> 00:13.198
But I got my spaceship, daddy.

00:13.199 --> 00:15.474
Yeah, but you'll get this one too.

00:15.475 --> 00:16.916
I like mine.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.234
His birthday is not 'till Saturday.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.464
You're not gotta have to work, are you?

00:22.519 --> 00:25.568
Rose, I wouldn't miss Sammy's
birthday party for the world.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.661
I promise.

00:32.577 --> 00:35.119
Maybe one day you can go to the Moon.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.019
Would you like that?

00:36.020 --> 00:38.133
But only in my spaceship.

00:38.851 --> 00:41.165
Only in your spaceship.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.454
What's the matter, Tyler?

00:47.578 --> 00:51.071
To be in some stakeouts make you sleepy?

00:52.354 --> 00:55.141
Actually, I was hoping to wake up to discover...

00:55.290 --> 00:58.402
...institution of the proper Amber Alert system.

00:58.708 --> 01:01.288
You're off your snots, Tyler.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.275
Well, too bad the park ain't open.

01:12.276 --> 01:15.873
We could pinch this kidnapper,
hand mr. Kreshpane his baby...

01:15.874 --> 01:19.472
...and go for funnel cakes and lap dances.

01:21.233 --> 01:24.141
Something tells me Wall Street
wasn't beckoning.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.461
Well, I hope baby Andrew is...

01:27.462 --> 01:29.211
...safe wherever he is.

01:29.212 --> 01:32.366
Baby Andrew is gonna be dead baby Andrew
if we get made.

01:32.454 --> 01:34.726
His daddy's cash payment.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.951
Got a boogie.

02:28.501 --> 02:29.903
Where is my son?

02:29.904 --> 02:32.307
Where is my boy? What has he done with him?!

02:33.822 --> 02:37.002
- You're under arrest for kidnapping.
- Kidnapping?

02:51.839 --> 02:55.072
Sam, why do you look so stricken?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.077
It's about my father.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.824
What about him?

03:01.912 --> 03:06.139
He walked out on my mother
and me this year. 1973.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.446
He's just...dissapeared from our lives.
We never heard from him again.

03:10.463 --> 03:12.102
Where did he go?

03:12.103 --> 03:13.664
I don't know.

03:13.769 --> 03:15.690
Well, why did he go?

03:16.927 --> 03:18.289
I've no idea.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.843
Well, do you know anything, Sam?

03:21.575 --> 03:24.722
He left town in the middle of
my forth birthday party.

03:24.933 --> 03:27.263
Before I even blew out the candles.

03:28.095 --> 03:31.097
Well...he should be arrested for that alone.

03:31.214 --> 03:33.605
It's my birthday this Saturday.

03:33.629 --> 03:36.678
The exact date he vanished in 1973.

03:36.820 --> 03:38.350
Wait. So tomorrow's your birthday?

03:38.351 --> 03:39.496
Yeah.

03:39.807 --> 03:41.519
How old are you gonna be?

03:42.769 --> 03:44.892
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

03:44.893 --> 03:46.802
Sam, you're not gonna be four.

03:46.803 --> 03:47.997
Am to.

03:47.998 --> 03:50.262
Now you're acting like a four-year old.

03:50.594 --> 03:54.962
Annie, after the car hit me and
I arrived here at 1973 I saw an image...

03:54.963 --> 03:57.484
...of a woman, my mother, wearing a red dress...

03:57.485 --> 04:00.662
...being chased, through the woods...

04:00.663 --> 04:05.781
Now, I can't explain it, but I keep seeing it.

04:06.308 --> 04:09.319
You know...over and over again.

04:12.074 --> 04:16.108
Sam...maybe we should have a little...
birthday party for you.

04:16.326 --> 04:18.523
You know, I can make a cake.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.842
Uuugh, I can't on Saturday because
I have to go to Lee's cousin's wedding, but...

04:24.146 --> 04:26.025
Well, maybe on Monday.

04:26.026 --> 04:27.733
You're missing a point.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.017
Maybe this is the reason why I'm here.

04:30.041 --> 04:32.390
To figure out what happened to my family.

04:33.542 --> 04:36.220
And to prevent my father from leaving.

04:40.808 --> 04:44.443
Are you saying that
this filthy kidnapper is your father?

04:45.963 --> 04:48.073
That's exactly what I'm saying.

04:59.622 --> 05:01.622
Happy birthday to me.

05:03.394 --> 05:05.116
My name is Sam Tyler.

05:05.408 --> 05:08.924
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.

05:08.953 --> 05:11.153
I don't know how or why I'm here.

05:11.158 --> 05:14.617
But whatever's happened -
it's like I've landed on a different planet.

05:14.618 --> 05:18.400
Now maybe if I can work out the reason -
I can get home.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.410
I swear to you: I had no idea
this was about a kidnapping.

05:29.411 --> 05:31.239
I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.369
So says every criminal I ever arrested.

05:33.370 --> 05:35.454
I know nothing about a baby.

05:35.455 --> 05:39.401
Yeah, right, and I got zero interest
in jacking up Bridget Bordo.

05:39.786 --> 05:42.374
So...you dare to dream...

05:42.375 --> 05:46.252
...seek greener pastures when
you read about Kreshpane's windfall...

05:46.253 --> 05:48.107
...you planned your score.

05:58.077 --> 06:03.444
Get off your rusty dusty and
tell us where that baby is.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.350
You okay?

06:08.567 --> 06:09.761
Yeah.

06:13.090 --> 06:16.866
You know...I got a boy at home, his name is Sam.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.298
Yeah, I got a French bulldog
at home named Ali...

06:19.299 --> 06:23.250
...who drools like your grandfather.
Where we going we all the noise?

06:23.251 --> 06:25.915
This is coincidence, that's all.

06:27.751 --> 06:31.002
I got two Sam Tylers in my life.

06:32.804 --> 06:35.041
I think I wanna talk to my lawyer now.

06:38.627 --> 06:41.527
Look, you're father and a parent.

06:41.528 --> 06:43.788
And you love your son a lot, right?

06:45.666 --> 06:46.883
Yeah.

06:47.013 --> 06:50.019
Yeah, I love my son
very much. So what?

06:51.183 --> 06:53.181
So how can a guy like that...

06:53.182 --> 06:56.793
...in the early dawn collecting a ransom?

06:56.794 --> 06:58.693
How does he get there?

07:02.393 --> 07:03.600
Look...

07:03.601 --> 07:05.723
...it was supposed to be
a simple collection from a bookmaker.

07:05.724 --> 07:06.967
At least, that was I was told.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.717
What? What do you mean?

07:08.718 --> 07:11.378
I owe the people money. Now they're
threatening to me and my family.

07:11.379 --> 07:12.920
Who's people?

07:16.150 --> 07:18.606
Pignato Brothers.

07:24.869 --> 07:26.839
Who the hell are the Pignato Brothers?

07:26.840 --> 07:30.830
The Pignato Brothers are an up-and-coming crew
of the Lower East Side's criminal underworld.

07:30.831 --> 07:34.414
They were penny-ante hoodlums until last year.

07:34.415 --> 07:36.700
- Freddy Benneti.
- Freddy Benneti...

07:36.701 --> 07:37.163
Who?

07:37.164 --> 07:41.767
Freddy Benneti was a small time bookie
we found in a dumpster on Avenue C.

07:41.838 --> 07:44.713
Wait, he's missing eyes, ears and a nose.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.918
And hand and tongue.

07:46.953 --> 07:49.214
You can see it in that photo.

07:49.391 --> 07:51.192
Word on the street:
the Pignatos wanted it known...

07:51.193 --> 07:54.947
...you have crossed them,
you have violated on of their 5 senses...

07:54.948 --> 07:56.729
...they retaliate.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.817
Symbolically.

07:57.818 --> 07:59.942
Tin snips.

08:02.179 --> 08:03.938
They use tin snips.

08:03.939 --> 08:06.031
Turned Freddy into potato head.

08:06.364 --> 08:10.045
Do we know of Kreshpane's any
business associations with Pignatos?

08:10.046 --> 08:11.891
Mr. Kreshpane said there were none.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.099
That's exactly why we need to lean hard on Vic Tyler.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.020
This cretin's every shade of shady.

08:18.426 --> 08:21.945
He keeps jerking us around -
we'll have a dead baby on our hands.

08:22.815 --> 08:24.104
Enter.

08:26.545 --> 08:28.970
Mr. and Mrs. Kreshpane are here.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.196
Boss?

08:31.197 --> 08:33.999
Maybe we should have Vic Tyler
meet with Kreshpanes. Face to face.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.062
What for?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.849
Vic's got his own family.
If he have even a ounce of humanity...

08:38.850 --> 08:41.881
...he'll be more forthcoming in the presence
of the devastated parents.

08:41.883 --> 08:43.327
What do you say, Boss?

08:44.630 --> 08:46.211
Get Vic Tyler.

08:46.513 --> 08:47.546
Okay.

08:47.671 --> 08:50.817
But if this doesn't work -
you know what happens next?

08:50.818 --> 08:51.753
What?

08:51.754 --> 08:54.294
I break out a damned snips.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.241
Mr. and Mrs. Kreshpane, I know...

09:00.288 --> 09:01.972
...this is extremly difficult...

09:01.973 --> 09:06.604
The kidnapper threatened to do a horrible things
to Andrew if we got the police involved.

09:06.605 --> 09:09.429
We are working on this as fast as we can.

09:09.430 --> 09:10.928
Trust me.

09:12.649 --> 09:13.982
Vic Tyler.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.149
This is Andrew Kreshpane's parents.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.076
Where is our baby, Mr. Tyler?

09:18.399 --> 09:19.017
Where is he?

09:19.018 --> 09:22.205
Please. We need him to come home.

09:22.671 --> 09:25.966
I'm sorry. I have no idea. I can't help you.

09:26.420 --> 09:28.402
Alright. Come here.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.632
What if your son was kidnapped?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.090
Huh?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.922
Can you imagine being separated from him?

09:40.421 --> 09:42.941
Can you imagine a heartbreak
it would cause you and your wife?

09:42.942 --> 09:45.630
Look, I feel lousy about this, I really do.

09:45.631 --> 09:48.429
But the Pignatos are accounted for that baby, not me.

09:49.004 --> 09:52.261
What if you take the fall?

09:53.455 --> 09:55.240
What happens to your family?

09:55.341 --> 09:57.124
Who provides for them?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.863
Alright, look...

10:02.141 --> 10:04.665
I expect a phone call
this afternoon at 2 o'clock.

10:04.666 --> 10:06.592
To arrange for the money exchange.

10:06.593 --> 10:08.504
For that's all that I know.

10:08.599 --> 10:11.102
The Pignatos don't know I got pinched.

10:11.413 --> 10:12.788
Not yet.

10:14.896 --> 10:17.150
You're doing the right thing here.

10:19.476 --> 10:22.949
Anything just to put this behind me. You know?

10:26.291 --> 10:31.749
On Saturday is my boy's birthday.
I throw a party for him in a park.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.523
Ice-cream, cake.

10:34.524 --> 10:39.340
And a cowboy that comes by
and makes funny animals out of baloons.

10:41.991 --> 10:44.209
I'd like to be there for that.

10:50.621 --> 10:52.174
You will be.

11:00.675 --> 11:02.606
So, what's a plan, Sam?

11:02.607 --> 11:06.542
Ugh, we wait for the call from the Pignatos, and...

11:07.332 --> 11:10.118
...and once they give you location of the money-drop,
we'll take it from there.

11:10.119 --> 11:11.668
There's our house.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.140
Yes, it is.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.470
Never will.

11:24.195 --> 11:26.474
I sell cleaner supplies for a living.

11:26.475 --> 11:28.083
I'm on a road a lot.

11:28.583 --> 11:32.003
Money's not great, but
you plug away, make yourself alive.

11:32.134 --> 11:36.556
I tried to lighten the load by making some bets.
I made some bad bets.

11:37.012 --> 11:38.260
Couldn't pay them back.

11:38.261 --> 11:42.961
They got me running these errands,
these low-level underlings.

11:43.128 --> 11:45.022
No big shakes, right?

11:45.326 --> 11:50.626
But look at me now. I got a cop in my living room
like I'm some common criminal, waiting for these...

11:50.702 --> 11:52.841
...freaking psychos to call me.

11:53.741 --> 11:55.046
I'm sorry.

11:55.675 --> 11:57.021
It's okay.

11:57.339 --> 11:59.240
We gonna figure this out.

11:59.959 --> 12:01.715
My wife, she made me quit the cigarettes...

12:01.716 --> 12:05.524
...so I do these puzzles, they help me during stressful times.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.414
But you still once in a while sneak one
when she's at the grocery store, right?

12:10.415 --> 12:12.435
I never said I was perfect, Sam.

12:15.275 --> 12:16.504
You know...

12:16.505 --> 12:19.037
...I got a real superstition about these things.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.144
Once you get a puzzle you can't solve...

12:21.145 --> 12:23.935
...the key is always in the bottom right-hand corner.

12:23.936 --> 12:27.850
And once you figure that out, it just unfolds.

12:27.851 --> 12:30.352
That's your superstition? That's your method?

12:34.048 --> 12:37.165
Not really sure what's working for me, but I get by.

12:38.036 --> 12:40.270
Rose. Hey, baby. This is a...

12:40.515 --> 12:43.393
Detective. What are you doing here?

12:44.324 --> 12:49.260
Oh, there's been a rash of neighbourhood
break-ins lately, Missis Tyler...

12:49.275 --> 12:51.960
...I'm just doing a...routine canvass.

12:51.961 --> 12:53.565
You two know each other?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.752
Well, yeah, I used to pound a beat
in this neighbourhood, so...

12:56.753 --> 12:58.853
We met once. Briefly.

12:58.854 --> 13:00.307
Oh, I see.

13:00.308 --> 13:01.997
Honey, Sammy is asking for you.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.381
Hey.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.927
You want to meet the little guy?

13:06.186 --> 13:07.602
No, I'm good.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.591
It's detective Skywalker, right?

13:14.592 --> 13:18.370
Yes, but...please, call me Luke.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.576
What's trouble is my husband in?

13:20.704 --> 13:22.690
What makes you think he is in trouble?

13:22.691 --> 13:24.916
No, like I said, there's been
some break-ins and I...

13:24.917 --> 13:29.785
I think, we left niceties at the door
of that night at the club, detective.

13:31.629 --> 13:34.692
Please, I just want to know the truth.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.236
All right.

13:40.593 --> 13:43.172
I had to ask him some questions...

13:43.179 --> 13:47.104
...about a couple of things
following police protocol.

13:47.105 --> 13:48.482
Please.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.322
Don't worry.

13:50.628 --> 13:53.337
If Vic is guilty of anything - it's working too hard.

13:53.338 --> 13:55.400
Missing time with his family.

14:03.824 --> 14:07.203
I understand your son has
big birthday coming up.

14:07.756 --> 14:09.212
Let me guess...

14:10.168 --> 14:12.446
...you bought him a Big Jim doll.

14:12.628 --> 14:14.285
How could you possibly know that?

14:14.565 --> 14:16.059
Well, you know...

14:16.060 --> 14:18.948
...all the kids love them these days, right?

14:25.108 --> 14:28.637
That reminds me I have
to make sure that I have everything...

14:28.638 --> 14:30.874
...to bake the Sammy's cake for tomorrow.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.982
Would you have something to drink?

14:32.983 --> 14:35.226
No, thanks, mom...Missis Tyler.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.315
Frazier brings up the ball.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.432
Passes to DeBusschere.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.836
DeBusschere looks for Willis Reed,
but Reed's being double-teamed, so...

15:15.837 --> 15:19.395
...Dave finds Phil Jackson. Jackson finds
Sammy Tyler at the top of the key.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.363
Tyler shoots...

15:21.732 --> 15:23.794
Nothing but net.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.584
Hey, my kid is big "Knicks" fan.

15:30.936 --> 15:33.476
Sammy's in danger, isn't he?

15:33.477 --> 15:35.383
Rose also?

15:35.854 --> 15:39.359
The Pignatos are surely gonna
come after them. Why wouldn't they?

15:39.496 --> 15:44.007
And by blowing a whistle on them,
you making me sign my family's death warrant.

15:46.233 --> 15:49.336
I'll do everything I can to protect them.

15:50.965 --> 15:52.359
I promise.

15:55.502 --> 15:57.658
You know, Sammy wants to be an astronaut.

15:57.659 --> 15:59.073
Or a cop.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.626
Who doesn't? Right?

16:03.074 --> 16:04.535
You got kids?

16:04.536 --> 16:05.493
No.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.668
Maybe someday.

16:06.669 --> 16:08.678
Take it from someone who knows...

16:08.679 --> 16:11.205
...there's no time like the present.

16:15.715 --> 16:19.174
What's he like? The boy?

16:19.175 --> 16:21.177
He's busy up in the head.

16:21.178 --> 16:23.017
All that make-believe.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.359
Takes after his father.

16:29.543 --> 16:31.224
When things are rough, you know...

16:31.225 --> 16:34.230
...I'm in some tidewatered town...

16:34.355 --> 16:36.822
...trying to hack my wares, I can't make a sell...

16:36.823 --> 16:39.217
...sleeping in the back of a car, 'cause...

16:40.025 --> 16:42.418
...I'm trying to save money on a motel.

16:42.577 --> 16:43.591
And I gotta hear one more guy say:

16:43.592 --> 16:46.313
"Sorry, not interested".

16:49.371 --> 16:52.387
What I do to make thing alright...

16:53.694 --> 16:55.617
...I just tell myself, I say:...

16:55.618 --> 16:57.596
"I'm Sam's father".

17:02.464 --> 17:04.529
Then everything...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.948
...every little thing...

17:07.928 --> 17:10.098
...it's okay, you know?

17:13.534 --> 17:15.340
I'm sorry, it's kinda...

17:15.664 --> 17:17.794
No, no, it's a...

17:21.292 --> 17:22.692
It's what?

17:23.048 --> 17:25.049
It's...well, it's...

17:26.357 --> 17:28.861
...it's a game to five and winner's out.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.202
Hey, high five.

17:54.522 --> 17:55.448
What?

17:55.612 --> 17:57.969
- High five.
- Hey, how you doing?

17:58.285 --> 17:59.281
Like this.

17:59.777 --> 18:01.934
High five, okay.

18:20.611 --> 18:22.293
No-no, baby, I got it, I got it.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.356
One of the perks of being Irish -
no hair on the chest.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.356
You okay?

18:41.830 --> 18:43.613
Yeah? You sure you're not
one of these guys...

18:43.614 --> 18:45.031
...who's a little bit light on his feet?

18:45.032 --> 18:46.014
What?

18:46.015 --> 18:47.689
- No?
- Yeah?
- No!

18:47.690 --> 18:49.369
- Because since I met you...
- No, no...

18:49.370 --> 18:52.360
...you've been looking at me in
a way that makes me just a little bit nervous.

18:52.361 --> 18:56.270
No, that's part of my investigative technique.

18:56.271 --> 18:58.155
I study a man to...

18:58.156 --> 19:00.331
So that's what it is.

19:00.332 --> 19:02.704
- Let me do that for you.
- You do that.

19:02.947 --> 19:06.571
So we will be outside the place
monitoring your wire.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.625
As soon as we hear
the money exchange go down...

19:09.697 --> 19:13.010
...we come blazing in and start finding out
the whereabouts of Kreshpane baby.

19:13.011 --> 19:13.948
Okay.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.863
- Jeez.
- It's normal to be scared, Vic.

19:18.864 --> 19:20.400
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

19:20.401 --> 19:21.725
Yeah, well, you know...

19:21.726 --> 19:25.842
I met the Pignatos one time.
Mostly I just dealt with middlemen.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.516
What are they like?

19:28.164 --> 19:29.433
What are they like? Well...

19:29.858 --> 19:32.453
When I was a kid growing up in a Bensonhurst...

19:32.547 --> 19:34.496
There was this one time we caught these rats.

19:34.497 --> 19:37.737
These big suckers - long, pink tails like whips.

19:37.753 --> 19:39.443
Greasy hindquarters.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.014
And we kept them.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.835
We kept them in a junked out
icebox in the basement.

19:46.290 --> 19:48.183
After about a week of starving and all...

19:48.184 --> 19:50.044
...they started to chew their way out.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.533
Right through the metal.

19:53.537 --> 19:55.182
I just happened to be there when they did.

19:55.183 --> 19:57.965
Their faces were poking out.

19:57.966 --> 20:01.099
Their little jaws all bloody from the effort.

20:01.529 --> 20:06.524
Never in my life had I seen such a maniacal rage.

20:07.508 --> 20:12.922
That is, until I met Tommy and Angelo Pignato.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.349
Now for a whole five seconds.

20:15.350 --> 20:17.841
You know why they were pissed off, Sam?

20:18.370 --> 20:19.448
Why?

20:21.171 --> 20:22.886
Because the "Mets" lost.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.208
Listen, if I'm gonna die tonight...

20:27.209 --> 20:28.342
I'm not gonna let that happen.

20:28.343 --> 20:30.056
If anything happens...

20:30.663 --> 20:34.858
...I want you to deliver
the news for Rose and Sammy, ok?

20:38.160 --> 20:41.447
Tomorrow, if everything you told us is true...

20:42.396 --> 20:45.850
...you'll be blowing out candles
on Sammy's fourth birthday, ok?

20:46.002 --> 20:46.909
Yeah.

20:47.642 --> 20:49.593
We're off to see the wizard.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.597
These bills are real?

20:57.936 --> 20:59.133
The bills are real.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.756
That's not my worry.

21:01.366 --> 21:02.881
My worry...

21:02.908 --> 21:04.805
...if this guy for real.

21:22.988 --> 21:25.002
Easy does it, old man.

21:31.179 --> 21:32.213
Okay.

21:32.214 --> 21:33.291
He's in.

21:33.388 --> 21:35.166
No-Nuts said it's your birthday on Saturday.

21:35.167 --> 21:35.663
That's right.

21:35.664 --> 21:37.534
Got any big plans?

21:37.917 --> 21:39.531
I don't like birthdays, Chris.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.607
Police? Not me. Not a chance.

21:43.782 --> 21:44.860
No!

21:45.086 --> 21:46.813
Shots fired! Shots fired!

21:55.695 --> 21:59.002
Listen to me.
Who did this to you? Who shot you?

22:08.472 --> 22:10.636
Here's quarter, Sammy. Knock yourself out.

22:10.637 --> 22:15.155
Remember, Sammy. If you can beat my high score -
I got a Dum-Dum root beer for you.

22:15.156 --> 22:16.666
Thanks, Uncle Butchie.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.025
Who shot you?

22:18.097 --> 22:21.970
Chris, go upstairs. No one leaves the building.

22:22.450 --> 22:25.271
Listen to me. Who shot you? Give me a name.

22:28.074 --> 22:29.313
Vic, you're in here?

22:29.314 --> 22:30.386
Sam.

22:30.738 --> 22:31.986
I'm here.

22:33.959 --> 22:34.762
I've been shot.

22:34.763 --> 22:37.103
Careful, please, careful.

22:37.352 --> 22:38.943
Easy, easy.

22:40.557 --> 22:42.543
Let me see. Let me see.

22:44.142 --> 22:45.410
Where is the briefcase?

22:45.411 --> 22:46.843
They took it.

22:47.128 --> 22:49.467
I don't know how they know I squeeled.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.334
Which way did they go?

22:52.361 --> 22:53.915
I didn't see.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.130
They ran off.

22:56.546 --> 22:59.307
I thought they gonna
come back and finish the job.

23:01.072 --> 23:02.255
He's been shot!

23:04.913 --> 23:06.583
He needs a doctor, not an interrogation!

23:06.584 --> 23:08.440
We have to find them.

23:09.674 --> 23:11.131
And the baby.

23:12.247 --> 23:13.712
Let's go, I'll be okay.

23:13.714 --> 23:15.965
Stay put. I'm gonna call an ambulance.

23:19.188 --> 23:20.399
See anyone?

23:20.459 --> 23:23.549
Nobody came out the back, but there's
a delivery door in the basement we didn't know about.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.469
They might've got out that way.

23:29.388 --> 23:30.960
Chris, you alright?

23:36.152 --> 23:37.805
It's baby Andrew.

23:37.806 --> 23:39.915
I heard him crying from
all the way down the hall.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.548
Poor little guy probably
hasn't been fed all day.

24:03.256 --> 24:05.792
So the loot says
the DA is gonna drop the charges.

24:06.511 --> 24:09.852
I'm still embarrased I got wrapped up
in any of this in the first place.

24:09.855 --> 24:13.462
We never would've found the baby
if you hadn't risk everything to help us.

24:13.948 --> 24:15.740
You did good thing today.

24:16.366 --> 24:17.982
Really good thing.

24:18.604 --> 24:19.819
Okay.

24:23.301 --> 24:26.382
I'm sure your son will be
very proud of all his father did today.

24:31.831 --> 24:34.517
I guess now you'll be able to go help
and blow out his candles.

24:36.665 --> 24:37.881
Won't you?

24:40.186 --> 24:41.747
Won't you, Vic?

24:43.526 --> 24:45.178
Absolutely.

24:46.688 --> 24:48.529
I wouldn't miss it.

24:59.868 --> 25:01.664
Where did you get your rocket?

25:01.694 --> 25:04.504
It was with him when we found him.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.964
Maybe one day you'll get
to the Moon too, Sammy.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.129
That's not Andrew's.

25:27.938 --> 25:29.854
Where is he? Where is Vick?

25:29.855 --> 25:31.340
He left this morning.

25:31.341 --> 25:32.860
Did he say where he was going?

25:32.861 --> 25:35.159
Who knows where he goes
when he goes? I don't.

25:35.383 --> 25:36.924
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

25:36.925 --> 25:39.970
Detective, do you know
what Vic is wrapped up in?

25:40.289 --> 25:40.938
No.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.247
I'm not sure, no.

25:43.248 --> 25:44.813
I'm not surprised.

25:44.814 --> 25:45.743
But I'll say one thing.

25:45.744 --> 25:46.530
Since you showed up yesterday...

25:46.531 --> 25:49.948
...Vic has been even more agitated
than usual, and I would like to know why that is.

25:53.544 --> 25:54.901
I want you to promise me something.

25:54.902 --> 25:56.286
Please.

25:56.336 --> 25:59.273
Be careful. There is some very bad men out there...

25:59.274 --> 26:01.888
Who barge in the stranger's home
whenever they damn well please.

26:01.889 --> 26:03.866
Yeah, I think I'm looking right at one.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.913
Contrary to what you might think, detective,
I don't always need saving.

26:08.312 --> 26:11.615
I'm a big girl, and I can take care
of myself and my boy.

26:11.645 --> 26:13.501
I know you can.

26:13.512 --> 26:15.221
It's just...

26:16.306 --> 26:18.009
You're wearing a red dress.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.302
My, detective. What keen power
of observation you have there.

26:23.527 --> 26:26.450
Are gonna wear that today
at Sammy's birthday party in the park?

26:26.451 --> 26:28.156
Here's a better question for you.

26:28.157 --> 26:32.370
What business is it of yours
what I wear to my son's birthday party?

26:35.951 --> 26:36.677
Hello?

26:36.678 --> 26:37.582
It's me.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.458
Listen, I need your help.

26:39.459 --> 26:42.523
Please, Annie. Vic's been lying to me,
to all of us this entire time.

26:42.524 --> 26:44.210
He's involved somehow.

26:44.657 --> 26:47.633
Can you keep an eye on Rose and Sammy
while I sort this out?

26:47.864 --> 26:51.630
Sam. I promised Lee I would go
to his cousin's wedding today.

26:51.631 --> 26:53.865
Look, it's just for a few hours, okay?

26:54.945 --> 26:56.352
Alright.

26:56.352 --> 26:57.111
Thanks.

26:57.112 --> 26:59.163
Have Central raise me
on the radio if you need me.

26:59.164 --> 26:59.784
Hey, Sam.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.885
Be careful. I'm worried about you.

27:04.202 --> 27:06.099
I'm not the one you should be worried about.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.830
Talk to you later.

27:30.664 --> 27:32.169
Excuse me, sir.

27:34.533 --> 27:35.770
Thanks, Uncle Butchie.

27:35.771 --> 27:39.281
- Hey, you're spoiling the kid, you know that?
- He's a kid worth spoiling.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.791
Go ahead, play the game.

27:41.644 --> 27:43.130
Uncle Butchie?

27:43.759 --> 27:45.677
Only my friends call me that.

27:45.678 --> 27:49.172
I'm a...friend of Vic Tyler's.

27:49.173 --> 27:50.311
You know him?

27:50.454 --> 27:53.815
Sure I do. He comes in here with
his kid Sammy all the time, but...

27:54.646 --> 27:58.624
...I doubt I'll be seeing him much now.
Not after what happened last night.

27:58.785 --> 28:00.369
First rule of the world.

28:00.854 --> 28:04.030
Don't make the wrong men mad.

28:07.641 --> 28:09.265
Sam, are you there?

28:09.266 --> 28:10.634
Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?

28:10.635 --> 28:14.368
I'm at the Sammy's birthday party
at Rowan Park. In the woods.

28:14.709 --> 28:17.367
I'm on my way.
Keep an eye on him 'till I get there.

28:17.368 --> 28:19.469
You see Vic Tyler - do not approach him.

28:19.470 --> 28:21.115
Radio me immediately.

28:23.104 --> 28:25.058
I can't let him get away.

28:26.445 --> 28:27.655
Not again.

28:38.957 --> 28:40.727
Annie, where are you?

29:23.990 --> 29:26.408
Annie, I've lost Tyler, you got him?

29:26.409 --> 29:28.256
Sam...

29:28.302 --> 29:30.421
Annie, 10-5, you're breaking up.

29:30.422 --> 29:32.817
Vic's sneaking his way into the woods.
I'm going after him.

29:32.818 --> 29:37.453
No, no. Listen to me.
Annie, do not follow him, he's dangerous.

29:48.327 --> 29:49.397
Excuse me, sir?

29:49.398 --> 29:52.504
Have you seen my dad?
I don't know where he is.

29:53.647 --> 29:55.294
Go back to your mother.

29:56.638 --> 29:58.723
I'm gonna go find your father.

29:59.046 --> 30:01.891
Sammy, come on, it's time
to blow out your candles.

30:05.861 --> 30:06.918
Annie!

30:16.354 --> 30:18.817
Who do you think you are,
spying on my family?

30:25.843 --> 30:26.974
Stop!

30:32.314 --> 30:34.144
- You hurt?
- I'm fine.

30:34.145 --> 30:36.873
I don't know if I can say the same for him.

30:37.756 --> 30:40.187
Go back to the party. Radio for backup.

30:40.188 --> 30:40.683
Sam.

30:40.684 --> 30:42.511
I need you to go back to the party, Annie.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.245
Now.

30:46.425 --> 30:51.230
Fine. But if you're not back
in 5 minutes - I'm coming back in.

31:07.515 --> 31:09.346
I know...

31:10.147 --> 31:12.080
I know how this looks, Sam.

31:12.081 --> 31:19.000
I left the station 'cause as to think
that you can protect me and my family from the Pignatos...

31:19.150 --> 31:20.609
Save it.

31:21.243 --> 31:22.788
I know the truth.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.775
I know you were trying to flee.

31:26.578 --> 31:28.872
I know you kidnapped a baby.

31:30.504 --> 31:33.349
Come on, I wasn't gonna hurt him.

31:33.484 --> 31:37.338
Just trying to get a little extra money, so that...

31:37.579 --> 31:40.105
...my family could live comfortably, I mean...

31:40.106 --> 31:44.585
...you got no idea what it's like
to not being able to provide for your family.

31:44.586 --> 31:47.394
Can't use them as excuse anymore, Vic.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.272
That was never about what your family needs.

31:55.315 --> 31:59.572
You weren't on the road being a salesman,
you were expanding your criminal concerns.

31:59.715 --> 32:02.138
You told my mother we were broke,
so she wouldn't hassle you about...

32:02.139 --> 32:04.066
...spending so much time away.

32:04.067 --> 32:05.198
Your mother?

32:05.626 --> 32:07.795
What you're about to do...

32:07.912 --> 32:10.349
...walking out on your family like this...

32:10.903 --> 32:13.040
Your son's gonna blame himself.

32:14.741 --> 32:19.226
And it's gonna affect every
meaningful relationship he forms.

32:19.462 --> 32:21.180
His entire life.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.121
I'm gonna tell you something, Sammy.

32:23.425 --> 32:25.628
Every thing that I do...

32:25.629 --> 32:27.552
...why I started all this in the first place...

32:27.553 --> 32:30.469
...came out of the need to take care of my family.

32:30.470 --> 32:31.629
To make sure they were safe.

32:31.630 --> 32:32.765
My wife.

32:32.766 --> 32:33.609
My boy.

32:33.610 --> 32:36.418
Being salesman - it just didn't cut it.

32:36.419 --> 32:37.589
No.

32:39.558 --> 32:40.520
That's a cop-out.

32:40.521 --> 32:42.858
What do you know about it, huh?

32:46.111 --> 32:47.441
Huh, Sam?

32:47.827 --> 32:49.648
What do really know?

32:51.572 --> 32:54.817
It was my fourth birthday party here at Rowan Park.

32:55.119 --> 32:57.705
And I just watched you dance with my mother.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.994
And I was about to blow out the candles.

33:01.627 --> 33:03.790
And I realised you weren't around.

33:05.364 --> 33:07.517
So I followed you into the woods.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.056
And I saw you.

33:10.349 --> 33:12.645
Beating a policewoman to death.

33:12.869 --> 33:14.449
You strangled her.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.220
And you kicked her.

33:16.436 --> 33:17.907
And you kicked her.

33:20.741 --> 33:22.464
And then you fled.

33:23.237 --> 33:25.135
And you never came back.

33:30.381 --> 33:31.956
But I blocked it out.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.818
I blocked it out 'till I came here.

33:37.558 --> 33:38.927
Memory...

33:41.303 --> 33:43.779
The memory, that was just too painful.

33:50.622 --> 33:52.480
Tell me something, boy.

33:53.707 --> 33:56.916
Did you have a good time at your fourth birthday party?

33:57.648 --> 33:58.664
No.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.586
I didn't become an astronaut either.

34:24.635 --> 34:27.513
Police? Not me. Not a chance.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.581
There are no Pignato Brothers.

34:46.820 --> 34:48.822
I can say "yes", but that...

34:48.831 --> 34:50.706
...wouldn't be telling the truth.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.034
What's the truth?

34:57.317 --> 34:59.824
I am the Pignato Brothers.

35:17.682 --> 35:18.765
You okay?

35:33.123 --> 35:34.969
You're not gonna shoot me, Vic.

35:35.581 --> 35:37.438
What makes you so sure?

35:38.367 --> 35:40.882
Because it's not who you really are.

35:42.862 --> 35:43.902
Maybe not.

35:43.903 --> 35:46.912
But I'm not gonna let you arrest me.

35:47.842 --> 35:50.566
I can't have my boy
knowing his father is in prison...

35:50.567 --> 35:53.127
...for doing terrible things. I can't do that.

35:53.128 --> 35:55.617
Right? I gotta think of Sammy.

36:16.097 --> 36:17.309
Dad.

36:28.109 --> 36:29.749
High five.

36:57.025 --> 36:57.866
Sam?

36:57.867 --> 36:59.507
Sam, can you hear me?

37:00.153 --> 37:01.511
Do you know your name?

37:01.512 --> 37:02.601
Sam Tyler.

37:02.602 --> 37:04.140
Where are you, Sam?

37:04.141 --> 37:05.572
New York City.

37:05.573 --> 37:07.141
What year is it?

37:21.696 --> 37:23.165
So...

37:24.545 --> 37:27.615
That woman you saw
running through the woods...

37:28.154 --> 37:29.796
...the one in the red dress...

37:29.797 --> 37:31.625
What about her?

37:35.571 --> 37:37.885
Thank you for saving my life.

37:39.701 --> 37:42.927
You know, I thought this was
the reason I was here.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.980
To stop my dad from leaving, but...

37:46.732 --> 37:50.805
...I think, maybe it was
to show me who he really was.

37:50.954 --> 37:52.204
I mean...

37:53.286 --> 37:55.365
...what other reason could there be?

37:56.689 --> 38:02.546
You have no idea how much good
you've brought to the 1-2-5.

38:04.173 --> 38:07.032
All the cases that you've worked on.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.625
They are the reason you're here.

38:15.821 --> 38:17.349
You should know...

38:19.310 --> 38:22.041
...I don't hate everything about this place.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.540
You should rest.

38:37.116 --> 38:40.111
I left you some puzzle books on the table.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.933
Happy birthday, Sam.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.665
When you get stuck on
the puzzle you can't solve...

39:02.975 --> 39:05.680
...the key is always in
the bottom right-hand corner.

39:07.689 --> 39:12.002
All the cases you've worked on -
they are the reason you're here.

39:40.183 --> 39:42.526
The key is always in the bottom right-hand corner.

39:42.527 --> 39:46.832
Once you figure that out -
the mystery...it's just unfodls.

40:23.034 --> 40:25.180
35 Steward Drive.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.436
Hello?

41:11.243 --> 41:11.777
Hello.

41:11.778 --> 41:13.405
Hello, Sam.

41:14.269 --> 41:16.389
- You can hear me?
- Of course, I can hear you.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.438
You're doing a good job, Sam.

41:18.439 --> 41:20.854
I need you to do something for me.

41:20.855 --> 41:21.515
Who is this?

41:21.516 --> 41:24.111
I need you to go to the basement.

41:25.832 --> 41:27.859
- Why?
- The basement, Sam.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.932
Across the room behind you.

41:37.263 --> 41:40.623
I need you to go down to the basement, Sam.
