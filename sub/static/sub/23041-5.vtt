Open one of those for us.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.920
You know you're the only one
who can stand these things?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.440
They're the only things left.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.640
[man] The pigs have all gone.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.400
Used to be full of pigs, that.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.200
Yeah, that and pig shit.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.680
-Dogs took care of them.
-Don't think I could hack being a pig.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.960
-[woman] I don't think you could either.
-[man] What's so bad about being a pig?

01:26.040 --> 01:27.200
It's undignified.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.360
Undignified?

01:29.440 --> 01:32.480
Walking about with your nose
the same height as your asshole.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.880
-[sniffs] Snout.
-[man 2] What's that?

01:35.280 --> 01:37.080
Pigs have snouts, not noses.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.720
So it would be your snout
the same height as your asshole.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.920
Nose, snout.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.480
You're still trotting about gazing up
everybody else's assholes all day long.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.160
What kind of society is that?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.320
An equal one?

02:11.280 --> 02:12.680
[man] So what do you reckon?

02:16.440 --> 02:17.480
Yes or no?

02:18.520 --> 02:21.240
I can give it a go.
You're not gonna be long?

02:22.200 --> 02:24.080
Five minutes, max.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.640
[man 2] Oh, fucking hell.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.360
This is mental, this is.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.120
I mean, he's dying anyway.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.200
Well, he is.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.440
I mean, it's not like it's gonna save him.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.560
He's got, what, days?

02:42.440 --> 02:45.080
Well, if it's what's in there
makes those days easier...

02:46.520 --> 02:47.840
that'll do for me.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.680
I promised my sister we'd help him.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.200
We all promised her.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.840
Plus there'll be other stuff in there.

If you hear anything, yeah, don't
fuck about, yeah? Just tear straight off.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.840
-Five minutes?
-[man] No more.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
All right?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.400
[man] You sure it's gonna be in there?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.720

And I'm figuring it can lock onto
this signal, so I'm gonna have to go dark.

16:29.960 --> 16:34.480
It's, um-- It stuck me with a tracker,
but I managed to get it out.
