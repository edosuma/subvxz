00:10.184 --> 00:10.880
Previously onFrom...

00:11.011 --> 00:13.230
Meagan, what are you doing?

00:13.361 --> 00:15.145
Maybe I can come in.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.190
Meagan, no!

00:19.062 --> 00:20.846
A man protects
his family, Frank!

00:20.977 --> 00:22.761
Open your eyes and look!

00:22.892 --> 00:24.154
No!

00:24.285 --> 00:26.548
"Norman, you're gonna be okay."

00:26.678 --> 00:28.289
"Tell my parents
I said... goodbye.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.768
"Ah!"

00:29.899 --> 00:32.249
Sorry, buddy, Norman's dead.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.686
Mom!
Julie killed Norman.

00:34.817 --> 00:35.731
What happened to Norman?

00:35.861 --> 00:37.515
The monsters killed them.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.517
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.389
Why is there a tree in
the middle of the road?

00:41.519 --> 00:44.305
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.178
Sorry to interrupt your service.
I was wondering

00:48.309 --> 00:50.572
if you could point me in
the direction of the highway.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.357
Yeah, you just keep on following
the road right up that hill,

00:53.488 --> 00:54.837
right where you were going
and you'll see.

00:54.967 --> 00:58.406
How is this possible?
We're on the same fucking road!

01:02.627 --> 01:03.933
Tabby?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.500
Dad, I think he's bleeding!

01:05.630 --> 01:06.718
There's something in his leg!

01:16.424 --> 01:17.990
Hey! We need help!

01:18.121 --> 01:20.515
You just rest.
I'll be back soon.

01:20.645 --> 01:23.866
Look at
the mess he made.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.737
Well, that's not
exactly his fault.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.609
I don't like.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.133
Let's get you downstairs.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.700
Can you stitch
the kid up inside the RV?

01:31.830 --> 01:33.876
Well, I don't
know wha--

01:34.006 --> 01:36.270
It'll work.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.750
-You know this is suicide.
-Just take care of the family.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.491
Run as fast as you can!
No matter what you see,

01:40.622 --> 01:41.753
no matter what you hear,

01:41.884 --> 01:43.451
-you do not stop!
-This isn't your fault.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.756
What do you mean?

01:47.019 --> 01:48.238
Hold his neck!

01:48.369 --> 01:50.110
-Yeah, you're doing great.
-Ethan, Ethan--

01:50.240 --> 01:51.633
Good, good, good, good.

01:51.763 --> 01:52.590
Shit.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.811
Kristi?

01:55.941 --> 01:57.769
They're comin'.

04:27.658 --> 04:37.929
â™ª

04:44.371 --> 04:46.547
Hands under the neck!
Under the neck! Good.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.070
-Why won't it stop?
-Kristi?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.202
-We're good, we're good.
-Ethan, come on.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.553
We're doing good.
Keep the airway open like that.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.560
Okay. Ethan?

04:59.690 --> 05:01.475
Ethan?

05:01.605 --> 05:03.085
Ethan?

05:05.914 --> 05:07.307
He's breathing.
He's stable. Okay?

05:07.437 --> 05:10.092
He has a pulse.
You're okay. You're okay.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.926
Is everyone okay in there?

05:18.056 --> 05:19.449
They're back.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.277
No. Wait.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.800
They came back for us.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.977
Are you going to let 'em in?

05:26.108 --> 05:27.849
No.

05:27.979 --> 05:28.980
Why are we waiting?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.982
I'm not letting 'em in!

05:33.158 --> 05:34.595
I'm gonna help 'em in, then.

05:34.725 --> 05:35.813
Jim, no!

05:35.944 --> 05:37.772
Jim, look-- stop!
Oh, hey! Jim, Jim!

05:37.902 --> 05:39.426
Back off! I need you--
I need you to--

05:39.556 --> 05:41.079
Take it-- take it easy.
All right, buddy.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.343
All right.
All right, buddy.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.520
They are not people and they are
not here to help, Jim!

05:46.650 --> 05:47.999
Let me go, man.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.088
Okay. You good?

05:50.219 --> 05:51.525
Let me go.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.135
Fucking fuck!

05:53.265 --> 05:54.179
All right.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.189
Can you see it?
You see it?

06:04.320 --> 06:05.974
It's right up there, come on.
We're good.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.976
-Come on! Go, go!
-Come on. Let's go.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.847
-Wait, where's my mom? Mom!
-Come on! Let's go.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.327
We're almost there!
Keep moving!

06:11.458 --> 06:13.198
-Come on!
-Don't stop! Go, go, go!

06:13.329 --> 06:15.070
-Hey! Hey!
-Watch out!

06:15.200 --> 06:17.115
Watch your step here!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

06:17.246 --> 06:18.334
Fuck! Pick him up!

06:18.465 --> 06:20.162
Are you okay?
Hey, I need help here!

06:20.292 --> 06:21.946
-No, no!
-Should we go back?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.948
Kenny, take them!
Kenny, You gotta take them!

06:24.079 --> 06:26.386
Go, go, go!
Don't stop. Don't look!

06:26.516 --> 06:28.431
-Come on!
-No, no, no, no!

06:28.562 --> 06:30.694
You've gotta get up!
You've gotta get up!

06:30.825 --> 06:31.608
You've gotta get up!

06:31.739 --> 06:33.001
Come on!

06:33.131 --> 06:34.437
Motherfucker, come on!

06:36.396 --> 06:39.137
You can't stop.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.802
Runners on the hill!
We got runners on the hill!

06:53.369 --> 06:54.892
Runners on the hill!

06:59.549 --> 07:00.550
-Go, go, go!
-Who's in there?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.073
-Don't look back! Go!
-Why are we--

07:02.204 --> 07:04.032
Come on! Go! Go!

07:08.340 --> 07:10.212
What are you doing?!
Open the door!

07:10.342 --> 07:11.605
Those aren't our people!

07:11.735 --> 07:13.258
Ellis is out there!
What's wrong with you?!

07:13.389 --> 07:16.261
I can't. No! I said no!

07:16.392 --> 07:18.220
Straight to the door!
Come on!

07:18.350 --> 07:19.830
-Open the door!
-Hello?!

07:19.961 --> 07:21.179
-Hey! Open the door!
-We need help!

07:21.310 --> 07:22.616
Hey! Hey!

07:22.746 --> 07:24.748
What's going on?
Why won't they open the door?!

07:24.879 --> 07:27.272
Donna!
Donna, let us in!

07:27.403 --> 07:28.622
We have people out here!
Open the door!

07:28.752 --> 07:30.928
-Donna, let us in!
-Do you hear that?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.889
What are you doing?
Let us in!

07:35.019 --> 07:36.325
Put the gun down
and open the door!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.544
Donna!

07:37.674 --> 07:39.023
You said not to
let anybody in here.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.809
-Never open the door after dark.
-I know you're scared,

07:41.939 --> 07:44.289
but are you really gonna
let those people die?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.857
Donna, hey!
Open the fucking door!

07:46.988 --> 07:48.337
Don't look at that!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.730
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:49.860 --> 07:52.036
-Julie.
-Hey! What are you doing?!

07:52.167 --> 07:53.603
Don't you recognize me?

07:57.738 --> 07:58.782
Oh, my God!

07:58.913 --> 08:00.871
-Go inside!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

08:03.831 --> 08:04.875
You, on the floor.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.486
What?

08:06.616 --> 08:08.923
-On the floor now!
-No, no, no, no.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.229
You don't have to get down! No!

08:11.360 --> 08:13.318
You shut your mouth! I said,
get on the goddamn floor!

08:13.449 --> 08:15.059
-Why?
-Just do what she says.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.104
-Now!
-It's okay.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.453
Tie them up.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.846
Hey, Donna, come on.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.500
We have a protocol.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.635
Ellis, just come on.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.290
Okay.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.902
Why are you doing this?

08:32.033 --> 08:33.643
We're not gonna
do anything!

08:33.774 --> 08:34.992
Please?

08:35.123 --> 08:36.341
Mom...

08:36.472 --> 08:38.518
It's okay. It's okay.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.171
I'm here, I'm here.
It's okay, baby.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.873
Are they gone?

08:47.222 --> 08:49.006
Hard to tell.

08:50.355 --> 08:53.924
You okay? Hey, Jim?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.186
Hey, you still with us?

08:55.317 --> 08:57.667
Yeah.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.669
You said--

09:01.279 --> 09:03.368
You said they aren't people.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.283
That's right.

09:05.414 --> 09:08.722
Then what are they?

09:08.852 --> 09:09.984
Well, we don't know.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.596
Look,

09:13.727 --> 09:17.557
these talismans, they're what
protect the houses in town.

09:17.687 --> 09:21.909
I don't know why it works,
but you got one of those,

09:22.039 --> 09:24.433
you keep the doors and windows
shut; they can't get in.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.175
Never tried it on a vehicle.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.350
This is impossible.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.700
Yeah, it is.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.226
Has he had seizures
like this before?

09:35.357 --> 09:38.055
No, never.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.972
What? What does that mean?

09:42.103 --> 09:43.844
Nothing.
It doesn't mean anything yet.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.019
It could mean
a number of things,

09:45.149 --> 09:47.630
trauma from the accident,
but right now,

09:47.761 --> 09:49.719
we need to focus on getting this
out of his leg so...

09:49.850 --> 09:50.981
Dad?

09:51.112 --> 09:52.417
Hey.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.334
Ah, I know.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.294
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Hey.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.775
Okay, sweets, we're just gonna
give you a little poke, okay?

10:01.905 --> 10:03.080
What is that?

10:03.211 --> 10:04.995
It's a sedative,
just to help keep him calm.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.257
Okay.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.390
Okay. All right.
Hey, look at me.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.131
Look at me.
No, you don't need to see that.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.741
That's it.
Look at me, look at me.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.134
Ow!

10:13.264 --> 10:14.831
-That's it, that's it.
-All done!

10:14.962 --> 10:16.441
There, look at you.
All done.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.182
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.315
-Alright?
-Yeah. That's it. That's it.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.976
Is he from the RV?

10:29.106 --> 10:31.021
No.
He's from another car.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.936
There was an accident
outside of town.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.983
So, there were two cars?
Never seen that before.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.725
Yeah. Neither have I.

10:43.599 --> 10:44.948
That's a nice watch.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.515
Hey. Just leave it alone.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.997
Why? It's not like it's
gonna do him any good here.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.129
Yeah. It's not gonna do
anything for you either.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.305
But it's pretty.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.481
So is he.

10:56.612 --> 11:00.442
I mean, even with
the blood and everything,

11:00.572 --> 11:02.618
he's very handsome.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.273
Don't touch anything, okay?

11:05.403 --> 11:08.189
Fine.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.321
I'm just gonna stay and look
at him for a little while.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.069
Where's my daughter?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.028
She's good. She's fine.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.030
Listen, sorry about what
happened down there,

11:23.160 --> 11:25.380
but it was necessary.
You'll understand that soon.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.164
I need to see Julie!

11:27.295 --> 11:28.339
She's good.
She's fine.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.514
You need some water.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.389
Here.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.394
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa-- stop!

11:39.524 --> 11:41.352
-Julie!
-Hey! Hey!

11:41.483 --> 11:42.527
-Julie!
-Stop!

11:42.658 --> 11:43.964
-Sit!
-Ow!

11:44.094 --> 11:45.095
Sit!

11:49.230 --> 11:50.318
Watch her.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.190
Okay.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.367
Listen.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
I know none of this
makes sense yet,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.331
but these are
precautions we have to take.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.985
We don't know you,

12:05.115 --> 12:07.422
and everyone reacts differently
on their first night.

12:07.552 --> 12:10.468
But I promise you, there is
not a single person here

12:10.599 --> 12:12.688
who wants to hurt you
or your daughter.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.299
Everyone in this house,

12:15.430 --> 12:19.956
everyone in this town has been
exactly where you are right now.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.046
I need to see my daughter!

12:23.177 --> 12:25.614
And you will.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.616
But first, we have to talk.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.359
There are things you need to
know about where you are,

12:31.489 --> 12:34.057
about the way things are now.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.407
This, unfortunately,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.409
is gonna be the worst
conversation of your life.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.286
Do you believe in monsters?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.383
Hello.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.563
I'm gonna take some peaches.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.086
You mind?

13:12.661 --> 13:15.316
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to take these.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.579
But-but Donna, she--

13:17.709 --> 13:19.189
she looks
the other way sometimes,

13:19.320 --> 13:23.628
and we all get a little wiggle
room on one or two things.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.457
I was gonna
open them in my room,

13:26.588 --> 13:29.373
but I'll open 'em here,
if you want some.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.858
You're from one of
those two cars, huh?

13:35.989 --> 13:39.993
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.473
It's special.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.003
What do you think it means?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.569
Please don't--

13:51.700 --> 13:53.354
Victor!
What are you doing?

13:53.484 --> 13:56.096
Leave that poor girl alone.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.272
We were
having a conversation.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.752
You're scaring her.
You know the rules.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.145
Now, take your peaches
and shoo.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.062
Hm.

14:07.411 --> 14:10.110
Sorry about that.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.328
He's creepy,
but he's harmless.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.635
He's just been here
a really long time.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.333
I'm Fatima.
I'm gonna be your proxy.

14:16.464 --> 14:20.424
My what?

14:20.555 --> 14:22.470
It's just a fancy way of saying
I'm here to keep you company.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.344
Sorry about the...

14:27.475 --> 14:30.130
Sometimes people freak out
a bit the first night.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.522
It's scary, and it's weird,

14:31.653 --> 14:33.655
and it's just sometimes
too much, you know?

14:33.785 --> 14:35.657
We just don't want
anyone getting hurt.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.746
Really?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.791
Is that why those guys
pointed guns at us?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.751
They shouldn't
have done that.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.755
Look, everybody here is just
doing the best they can.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.670
You really gotta focus
on the good things here.

15:00.073 --> 15:04.207
If I untie you, do you promise
not to do anything crazy?

15:04.338 --> 15:06.340
There's something I'd
really like to show you.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.474
Okay.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.562
Okay.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.446
Who did all this?

15:25.576 --> 15:29.798
Ellis.
He's really talented.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.366
I bet he'd love
to draw you.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.629
Why?

15:34.759 --> 15:36.761
'Cause you're beautiful.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.242
That's not funny.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.070
I wasn't being funny.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.945
Come on.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.513
We have to keep all
the windows covered at night.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.951
It's harder for them to trick
you if you can't see them.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.648
Who?

15:53.778 --> 15:56.346
Those things out there.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.827
They whisper,
try to get in your head.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.482
It said your name, right?

16:01.612 --> 16:05.312
Sometimes they convince people
to let them in and...

16:05.442 --> 16:07.575
Well...

16:07.705 --> 16:09.533
Here. Come here.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.579
Just don't--
don't look down.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.581
Just look out.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.420
Why did you bring me here?

16:26.550 --> 16:30.424
'Cause I wanted
you to see...

16:30.554 --> 16:32.643
that if you climb high enough,

16:32.774 --> 16:34.994
even a nightmare
can look like a dream.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.004
Okay, good.
Pulse is strong;

16:45.134 --> 16:47.397
his breathing's really good.
I think we're good to go.

16:49.704 --> 16:53.447
You really should've
let us help you.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.630
What happens if they get in?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.414
Jim...

17:04.545 --> 17:07.548
What...
happens if they get in?

17:09.985 --> 17:11.682
You have a gun.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.380
Why don't you use it?

17:13.510 --> 17:14.859
'Cause it won't do any good!

17:14.990 --> 17:16.513
You-- you just gotta trust me.

17:16.644 --> 17:17.688
I don't know you.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.352
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.441
Jim, Jim, Jim! Hey!
Jim! Jim, Jim, Jim!

17:31.572 --> 17:32.921
Hey, we just have to
wait it out, okay?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.923
With the talisman in the window,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.230
the only way they can get in
here is if we let 'em in.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.450
So, come on, just...

17:40.581 --> 17:43.453
Come on.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.980
Is that door secure?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
It's not gonna open.
Just, just--

17:50.808 --> 17:52.549
The talisman,
what if it-- what if it--

17:52.680 --> 17:53.898
-What if it falls?
-Kristi!

17:54.029 --> 17:55.248
-What if it falls?
-Kristi! Hey! Hey, hey!

17:55.378 --> 17:58.338
It's not gonna fall.
This is what they do, right?

17:58.468 --> 17:59.426
-Try to rattle you.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.515
Get in your head.

18:01.645 --> 18:04.561
Make you do something stupid.
You know that, right?

18:13.701 --> 18:14.963
They're on the roof.

18:18.445 --> 18:19.881
Okay, listen
to me, kiddo.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.753
Listen, hey, breathe with me.
Breathe.

18:22.884 --> 18:26.148
Okay. Let's forget
about what's outside.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.498
Let's just think
about what's in here.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.372
Focus on him.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.025
Okay?

18:34.156 --> 18:36.593
You got this, kiddo.
You got it.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.682
You got this, right?

18:38.813 --> 18:42.164
We focus on Ethan.

18:42.295 --> 18:46.299
We all stay calm.
You tell us what we need to do.

18:46.429 --> 18:47.822
Kenny!

18:47.952 --> 18:50.868
It's not right, tying 'em up
like fuckin' animals.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.914
They must be scared
out of their minds!

18:53.044 --> 18:54.872
They have their own way
of doing things here.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.439
Yeah.
It's a fucked-up way.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.485
Isn't it?

18:58.615 --> 18:59.877
Hey.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
There's a room made up
for you on the third floor.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.797
Just let the guys know when
you're ready to call it a night.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.364
What? You're not
gonna tie us up first?

19:09.757 --> 19:11.628
Thank you, Ellis.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.675
Uh, the man we helped
carry in, is he...

19:14.805 --> 19:17.068
Ah, yeah, no, that guy, uh,
yeah, he's still out.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.723
I mean, I don't know what kind
of drugs that guy was on,

19:19.854 --> 19:23.336
but he's gonna have a hell
of a time when he wakes up.

19:23.466 --> 19:27.078
Look, man, I know, uh...

19:27.209 --> 19:30.778
I know Donna can be
a little, you know...

19:30.908 --> 19:32.693
but they opened
the door, though, right?

19:32.823 --> 19:36.523
Eventually.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.785
Yeah, well, all I'm saying is

19:37.915 --> 19:39.395
tonight could've been
a whole lot worse.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.093
I mean, if you didn't leave
the fuckin' spike strip down--

19:42.224 --> 19:44.095
Hey, hey, come on!

19:44.226 --> 19:45.793
Are you fucking
kidding right now?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.795
Enough.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.062
Look, it's been
a long night, okay?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.324
Yeah.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.325
Come on.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.240
Yeah. Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.202
Just in case

20:03.332 --> 20:05.726
you could use a little
something to take the edge off.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.206
It's a kind gesture.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.166
Yeah, whatever.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.863
It's there for you
if you want it.

20:12.994 --> 20:13.864
See you in the morning.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.434
Sit.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.020
Okay, I guess I'm not
that great at chess.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.675
You good.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.765
Just... better.

20:44.895 --> 20:45.896
Yeah, you're okay.

20:47.724 --> 20:51.728
When I come America,

20:51.859 --> 20:56.167
I not speak English,
but I play.

20:56.298 --> 21:01.085
This, uh...
people speak same.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.044
Like a universal language?

21:03.174 --> 21:05.002
And you
taught Kenny.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.396
That's nice.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.529
Fu-Hen.

21:09.659 --> 21:10.747
What?

21:12.619 --> 21:14.621
His name:
Fu-Hen.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.798
He want to be America.

21:17.928 --> 21:22.498
He want America name.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.640
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

21:33.770 --> 21:37.078
I want my son!

21:37.208 --> 21:38.862
It's okay.
He went home for the night.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.908
He'll be back tomorrow.
Come on. Let's go.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.910
It's okay.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.739
Try to remember
where you are. Okay.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.045
Okay. We're gonna do
a nice clean pull.

21:48.176 --> 21:51.048
Nice and slow.
Now, it's gonna hurt a lot.

21:51.179 --> 21:52.354
Yeah.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.965
So we need him
as still as possible.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.097
Boyd, hold on to his legs,

21:56.227 --> 21:58.142
and you can hold
his neck area. Okay?

21:58.273 --> 21:59.535
Uh-huh. Okay.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.669
Ready?

22:02.799 --> 22:04.453
Mm-hmm.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.715
Here we go.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.112
Okay.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.940
All right.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.942
-Ah! That's all right.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.247
-That's all right!
-Please stop!

22:16.378 --> 22:18.511
-It hurts! Ow!
-All right, all right!

22:18.641 --> 22:19.599
That's it!

22:19.729 --> 22:21.035
Okay. Good.
Hold him still!

22:21.165 --> 22:23.254
-Daddy!
-Got it, got it, got it.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.605
-Yeah, that's okay.
-Stop! Ow!

22:25.735 --> 22:27.433
That's okay.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.696
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.787
Got it! Got it. Okay.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.223
All right.
Boyd, put pressure.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.746
Put pressure
got it, yeah.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.182
You did great.
You did so good.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.270
You did great.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.577
We're gonna patch
you up, okay?

22:41.708 --> 22:44.624
Good, good, okay.

22:44.754 --> 22:45.886
-Kristi? Hey, hey.
-Okay.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.191
Breathe.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.673
Okay.
Okay, you did great.

22:50.804 --> 22:51.805
Here we go.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.068
Just gonna
stitch him up.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.776
I don't want to.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.049
I can't.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.877
I can't do any more.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.406
Are you sure?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.411
Okay.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.069
I'm so sorry.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.706
How?

24:33.733 --> 24:35.604
All of it?

24:50.967 --> 24:53.230
My mom's-- my mom's probably
worried sick.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.058
She'll be fine.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.847
So I, uh, stopped
by the clinic the other day.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.283
Yeah? Let me guess,

25:02.413 --> 25:04.807
my dad try to rope you
into a game of chess.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.287
Ah, he did.

25:09.638 --> 25:13.860
Even when it gets bad, um,
you show him a chessboard

25:13.990 --> 25:16.427
and he doesn't always remember
how the pieces work,

25:16.558 --> 25:17.733
but he does
remember the game.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.823
You know, he used to make me

25:20.954 --> 25:25.088
play for hours when
I was a kid, and I hated it.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.829
Really?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.265
Now I, um...

25:32.356 --> 25:34.489
Uh, anyway, Kristi,

25:34.620 --> 25:36.926
I mean, she's just--

25:38.319 --> 25:40.408
I mean, she just takes
such great care of him.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.763
Look, Kenny,
they're gonna be okay--

25:47.894 --> 25:51.637
Boyd, Kristi, all of 'em.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.030
We're just gonna go out there
first thing in the morning.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.989
We're gonna pick 'em up
and bring 'em home.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.644
I'm not going.

25:59.906 --> 26:00.950
Of course you are.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.083
I can't.

26:03.213 --> 26:06.129
I--

26:06.260 --> 26:11.047
After what happened
to Lauren and Megan,

26:11.178 --> 26:13.702
I feel like I'm
hanging on by a thread here.

26:17.053 --> 26:21.014
I can't find
any more bodies.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.885
I just can't.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.254
Oh, fuck.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.476
Hey.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.738
Um...

26:49.869 --> 26:51.305
Hey.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.264
Uh, do, do you know
where Fatima is?

26:54.395 --> 26:57.224
Yeah, she's just--
um, she's in the restroom.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.012
Ah. Um...

27:03.143 --> 27:05.145
You're-- you're
Julie, right?

27:05.275 --> 27:07.190
And you're Ellis.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.105
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.109
Yeah.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.547
Um, hey, look,

27:16.678 --> 27:21.117
I'm sorry about what happened,
uh, downstairs earlier.

27:21.248 --> 27:25.252
Um, have-- have you had a
chance to see your mom yet?

27:25.382 --> 27:27.080
No.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.213
Uh, she's still talking to...

27:30.344 --> 27:31.258
-To Donna?
-Donna, yeah.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.476
Yeah, right.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.782
Right.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.655
Right.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.051
I...
I like your drawings.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.836
Thank you.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.185
Yeah.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.671
You're fucking crazy.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.673
You don't know how many nights

27:54.803 --> 27:57.197
I've laid awake
wishing that were true.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.331
How many times did you drive
down that road today?

28:01.462 --> 28:03.420
How many hours did
you spend in the car,

28:03.551 --> 28:05.988
going in a straight line that
somehow ended up being a circle?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.513
You saw those things outside.

28:09.644 --> 28:10.601
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.561
I don't know what I saw.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.433
That's what my sister said.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.435
Goddamn it, she was stubborn.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.221
How about a drink?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.833
Yep, I'm gonna
pour you a drink.

28:26.617 --> 28:30.360
My sister,
she was a real character.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.102
Not a woman to be trifled with,
I'll tell you that.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.410
She'd kick the teeth
off a bear

28:36.540 --> 28:38.760
if it looked
at her sideways.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.332
Me and her, we were on
a little hunting trip

28:45.462 --> 28:47.856
when we saw that
goddamn tree in the road.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.079
That's right.
Everyone sees the tree.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.430
Those
motherfucking crows.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.565
It was right before sunset.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.177
We'd already been
driving half the day.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.005
There was a motel
a few miles back.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.528
I said,
"Why don't we grab a room?

29:07.658 --> 29:09.748
"Start fresh in the morning
when the tree is cleared."

29:09.878 --> 29:12.315
But my sister didn't
want the deer to spoil.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.404
Plus, we'd run outta beer.

29:14.535 --> 29:18.495
It was already dark
when we got here.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.585
First time through,
didn't even stop.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.153
Saw some folks in the road,
drove right by.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.591
Second time through, one of them
stood in front of the car.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.463
Wouldn't get out of the way.

29:29.593 --> 29:33.119
Just stood there, smiling.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.732
I thought my sister was gonna
run the son of a bitch over.

29:37.863 --> 29:41.431
She never did have much
patience for assholes.

29:42.824 --> 29:46.959
Instead, she grabbed her
shotgun and got out of the car

29:47.089 --> 29:50.353
and started screaming at it,
making all sorts of threats.

29:50.484 --> 29:53.792
But it just stood
there, smiling.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.101
I'll never forget
how it stood there.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.364
So still.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.369
And then
it ripped her face off,

30:06.500 --> 30:10.243
right in front of me,
ripped it clean off.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.550
Started skinning her with
its hands in the street,

30:13.681 --> 30:15.161
just like we used
to skin those deer.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.470
I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.996
I just froze.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.347
And then I saw another one
coming toward the car,

30:27.477 --> 30:29.305
and that's when I ran.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.830
I couldn't even tell you
which direction I ran.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.875
They seemed to be everywhere.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.446
So I found a place to hide,

30:39.576 --> 30:42.144
some bushes at
the edge of the forest.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.016
I crawled into them and hid.

30:46.670 --> 30:50.413
That's what people
used to do to survive here.

30:50.544 --> 30:55.288
They'd crawl into the bushes
or find a place to hide

30:55.418 --> 30:58.334
and pray that they made it
through till morning.

30:58.465 --> 31:03.470
So, there I was,
crouching in those bushes,

31:03.600 --> 31:06.342
and when the blood stopped
pounding in my head,

31:06.473 --> 31:09.041
I realized I could still
hear my sister screaming.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.351
They weren't just killing her;
they were torturing her.

31:20.966 --> 31:25.318
Those, uh,
things out there, they...

31:26.623 --> 31:29.191
...they like to hunt,

31:29.322 --> 31:32.716
they like to play,

31:32.847 --> 31:34.936
so they were making it last.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.506
And I just left her there.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.206
See, you were lucky;

31:44.337 --> 31:46.426
the sun was still
in the sky when you got here,

31:46.556 --> 31:48.210
people came to help.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.169
Not everybody gets that.

31:53.041 --> 31:57.828
It's been, uh, three years,
six months and 17 days,

31:57.959 --> 32:01.484
and I can still hear my sister
screaming in my head.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.839
What is that?

32:08.970 --> 32:12.365
Saline -
helps clean the wounds.

32:12.495 --> 32:13.932
I thought saline comes in bags.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.542
Well, we don't
exactly have much

32:15.672 --> 32:17.283
in the way of
supplies around here.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.894
Couple machines we stripped off
an ambulance a few years back,

32:20.025 --> 32:23.289
but for the most part we just
improvise where we can.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.291
So, what are--
are you a doctor?

32:25.421 --> 32:27.510
I was a third-year
medical student.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.426
Wasn't exactly
the residency I had in mind.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.256
How about you?

32:34.387 --> 32:36.519
Engineer.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.608
I build theme park attractions.

32:38.739 --> 32:42.047
Roller coasters,
drop towers, stuff like that.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.659
What?

32:45.789 --> 32:49.489
Nothing. It's just you're still
speaking in the present tense.

32:49.619 --> 32:50.838
Hey.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.405
Sorry.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.320
Dad?

32:55.669 --> 32:58.106
Hi, honey.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.282
Hey.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.154
How are you?

33:02.284 --> 33:04.678
It hurts.

33:04.808 --> 33:07.855
I know. You got
a little banged up, but...

33:07.986 --> 33:10.466
I saw it.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.338
What'd you see?

33:12.468 --> 33:15.471
I saw the Lake of Tears.

33:17.517 --> 33:20.476
It was a drawing
on the wall.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.569
There were so many
drawings on the wall.

33:31.139 --> 33:36.014
Like when I used to
draw with crayons

33:36.144 --> 33:38.451
and you would
put it on the fridge?

33:46.633 --> 33:49.636
And we were all there
in the drawings,

33:49.766 --> 33:52.639
you and me...

33:52.769 --> 33:55.381
and Mom and Julie.

34:06.696 --> 34:10.004
But somebody screamed

34:10.135 --> 34:13.181
because the spider
came down from the ceiling.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.359
Hey.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.275
You're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.

34:22.582 --> 34:23.583
It's okay.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.503
The doctor told us
that the dementia

34:30.633 --> 34:32.983
was progressing
pretty rapidly, but...

34:33.114 --> 34:35.247
I dunno.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.857
He said, you know,

34:36.987 --> 34:39.599
we should make sure to
lock the doors at night and...

34:39.729 --> 34:43.342
and put a monitor on him,
maybe even strap him into bed.

34:43.472 --> 34:44.865
Right.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.737
None of which we did,
of course, because...

34:49.696 --> 34:50.784
Hey, it's okay.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.002
-It's fine.
-Come on.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.875
Oh. I'm good. I'm good.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.790
Kenny, maybe
we should, uh--

34:56.920 --> 34:59.967
It was just hard,

35:00.098 --> 35:02.665
you know,
to believe that he was...

35:05.538 --> 35:09.542
So, one night,
he wanders out of the house,

35:09.672 --> 35:13.720
and we didn't even know
he was gone at first.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.766
He took the bus
all the way to the city.

35:18.855 --> 35:21.423
My mom was so angry.

35:21.554 --> 35:25.166
We drove out to pick him
up and she kept saying,

35:25.297 --> 35:30.084
"Well, how could he do this?"
You know, "He knows better."

35:30.215 --> 35:34.915
And I'm just like,
"Mom, he has dementia.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.613
"He's not trying to
fucking piss you off."

35:39.485 --> 35:41.922
Well, you know what?

35:42.052 --> 35:43.793
The important thing
is you found him, right?

35:47.580 --> 35:50.322
On the drive home,

35:50.452 --> 35:53.412
I kept thinking,

35:53.542 --> 35:56.632
we got a second
chance now, you know?

35:56.763 --> 35:58.808
To do things right.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.553
And then you saw the tree.

36:06.686 --> 36:07.991
And then we saw the tree.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.168
Yeah.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.605
Can you guys maybe not sit in
the middle of the stairs?

36:12.735 --> 36:15.999
Right. Uh, sorry.
Sorry about that.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.392
We're just, uh...

36:19.829 --> 36:22.136
Sorry.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.486
Yeah, Kenny, you know what?
Maybe we should, uh...

36:26.445 --> 36:28.360
Kenny?

36:44.724 --> 36:47.683
Sara?

36:47.814 --> 36:50.164
I was taking a nap.
I didn't hear you come in.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.384
I'm gonna get
some dinner started.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.482
I didn't have a choice.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.224
Oh.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.792
Shh.

37:09.923 --> 37:13.622
Will you please help me?

37:21.717 --> 37:23.719
Okay.
You get some rest.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.634
I'm gonna go check
on the boy from the crash.

37:25.765 --> 37:26.896
N-no.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.421
This place, how--

37:29.551 --> 37:32.815
how you say? Scary.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.643
Night scary.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.384
Nightmare?

37:39.039 --> 37:43.130
When this--
when this no work,

37:43.261 --> 37:45.567
that's nightmare.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.614
Yeah, nightmare.

37:50.790 --> 37:51.834
Okay.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.926
You get some sleep.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.939
So, how does this work?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.854
Oh God, Jim, no. No!

38:54.984 --> 38:56.159
-No!

38:56.290 --> 38:58.118
-Oh--

38:58.248 --> 38:59.946
-Hey, hey.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.209
Hey, Kristi! Hey.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.429
Kristi, Kristi,
you're okay.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.475
You just dozed off. Okay?

39:09.651 --> 39:11.566
Is he okay?

39:11.697 --> 39:12.567
Hey.

39:14.874 --> 39:15.788
Good. Okay.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.794
The sun's coming up.
It's morning.

39:21.924 --> 39:24.187
We're good.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.841
We're okay.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.495
All right.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.193
Okay.

39:32.631 --> 39:42.510
â™ª

40:09.102 --> 40:19.025
â™ª

40:23.943 --> 40:25.510
Oh, my God.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.732
Oh, my God.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.956
Hey. Is he okay?
Is he okay?

40:37.086 --> 40:38.218
He'll be all right.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.394
Hi.
Are you okay, baby?

40:40.525 --> 40:42.788
Hey, baby, you okay?

40:42.918 --> 40:44.224
I've got you.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.921
Oh, God.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.540
Do you know the story

40:55.670 --> 41:00.109
about the little girl in a room
filled with broken glass?

41:01.633 --> 41:05.071
She knows the broken pieces
used to mean something.

41:05.201 --> 41:08.161
She knows there's
something they must have been.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.905
But all she can
see are the shards.

41:15.342 --> 41:20.042
And when she tries
to put them back together,

41:20.173 --> 41:21.827
they cut into her skin,

41:21.957 --> 41:26.832
cutting deeper
and deeper,

41:26.962 --> 41:29.878
and she bleeds
all over the floor.

41:33.229 --> 41:36.842
But she keeps on trying.

41:36.972 --> 41:40.802
She keeps trying because
she knows there's an answer.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.935
She knows there's
a shape they used to make.

41:43.065 --> 41:44.850
Sara--

41:44.980 --> 41:46.460
I hear their voices,

41:46.591 --> 41:50.159
and it's just like
the broken glass.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.774
They told me it had to look
like it was the monsters.

41:57.471 --> 42:01.257
I didn't want to,

42:01.388 --> 42:04.130
but they said it was
the only way to save us,

42:04.260 --> 42:06.001
it was the only way
to go home.

42:06.132 --> 42:10.832
Sara...
please, just--

42:10.963 --> 42:12.747
just tell me what you did.

42:19.101 --> 42:20.973
I left the door open.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.679
Kenny!
Kenny, wait!

42:55.050 --> 42:56.574
Hey.

42:58.532 --> 43:00.316
Let me go first.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.231
It doesn't have to be you.

43:04.277 --> 43:14.156
â™ª

44:20.266 --> 44:23.269
No!

44:36.543 --> 44:37.762
Kenny.

44:40.329 --> 44:43.637
Uh, where's the family?

44:43.768 --> 44:46.161
Father Khatri's bringing them
back up to Colony House.

44:48.163 --> 44:50.209
They shouldn't
be up there.

44:50.339 --> 44:55.083
Well, it's what they wanted.
It's only for the night.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.478
What are you doing out here?

44:58.608 --> 45:02.438
I, uh...

45:02.569 --> 45:05.964
I needed some wood
for the new set.

45:06.094 --> 45:09.315
We never varnished
the pieces.

45:12.622 --> 45:14.363
We made it together.

45:17.410 --> 45:19.368
It's one of the only
things we ever, uh...

45:23.677 --> 45:26.462
It's ruined now.

45:26.593 --> 45:30.379
The blood soaked
into the wood.

45:30.510 --> 45:33.426
You know, with my Dad,

45:33.556 --> 45:38.126
every single game would
always end the same way.

45:38.257 --> 45:40.781
I'd be down to my last piece,

45:40.912 --> 45:43.044
and I'd just keep moving
'round the same three spaces,

45:43.175 --> 45:44.437
trying to avoid him.

45:44.567 --> 45:46.352
Kenny--

45:46.482 --> 45:50.095
Those things,

45:50.225 --> 45:53.228
they walk;
they never run.

45:55.187 --> 45:57.015
You ever notice that?

45:57.145 --> 45:58.799
Yeah.

46:00.670 --> 46:03.848
It's like they're taking
their time, because...

46:03.978 --> 46:08.417
because they know there's only
so many places we can go.

46:14.423 --> 46:17.383
I think we're running out of
spaces on the board, Sheriff.

46:24.042 --> 46:33.921
â™ª

47:45.036 --> 47:47.473
Norman, they made it back
from the Lake of Tears!

47:47.603 --> 47:49.040
It wasn't too late!

47:49.170 --> 47:51.129
You're gonna
be okay.

47:51.259 --> 47:54.306
Everything's
going to be okay.

47:54.436 --> 47:57.396
Hey, you okay?

47:59.398 --> 48:00.965
What are
you looking at?

48:03.793 --> 48:05.317
Nothing.

48:15.762 --> 48:23.639
â™ª

48:23.770 --> 48:24.597
Shh.
