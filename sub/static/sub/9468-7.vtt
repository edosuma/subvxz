Juliette's body
isn't even cold.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.097
Look at her.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.307
There are
as many ways to grieve

00:17.350 --> 00:19.727
as there are people
in the world.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.774
You're really gonna
feed me that gem?

00:24.817 --> 00:27.442
You don't even
believe that, Norman.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.031
Suggest a doctor.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.408
I already have.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.620
No, no, no, no, no,

00:38.664 --> 00:40.623
- you can't be serious.
- I am. It's only the best

00:40.664 --> 00:42.584
- for my family.
- Well, the best for your family

00:42.625 --> 00:45.085
isn't family, trust me.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.338
Look, I can give you the name
of half a dozen therapists

00:47.381 --> 00:49.966
much more qualified
than I am in this field.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.887
She won't talk to anyone.

00:52.926 --> 00:55.514
<i>Well, what makes you</i>
<i>think she'll talk to me?</i>

00:55.554 --> 00:58.517
And what are they doing next?

00:58.557 --> 01:01.310
Patients on their first visit?

01:01.353 --> 01:05.105
Why are you so concerned
about what's typical here?

01:07.359 --> 01:10.652
We're both participating
in this charade for him.

01:10.694 --> 01:14.240
I just...
want to understand my role.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.161
Why do you think you're here?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.203
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

01:22.581 --> 01:25.376
Because some of us
at times must be mothers

01:25.418 --> 01:28.087
to more than just children.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.132
JR implied you're afraid
to be alone with me.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.010
Tell me... did he always need

01:34.052 --> 01:36.721
so much reassurance?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.933
Is that what it means
to be a mother to you?

01:39.974 --> 01:42.519
I was...

01:42.561 --> 01:45.022
raised by my father...

01:45.063 --> 01:48.108
and his threshold for nonsense
was nonexistent.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.652
That doesn't answer
the question of your feelings

01:50.694 --> 01:52.819
about motherhood.

01:52.861 --> 01:55.822
Would it pique
your interest more

01:55.864 --> 01:57.742
if I told you my father
was a severe disciplinarian?

01:57.784 --> 02:01.412
I'm asking you about your
personal experience of being

02:01.453 --> 02:04.290
- a mother.
- Why?

02:04.331 --> 02:08.168
Because your daughter
just died.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.927
There's a gallon of milk

02:15.968 --> 02:18.596
in the refrigerator
older than my daughter was.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.139
Do you think
that diminishes your loss?

02:24.895 --> 02:27.646
I think my loss is just that...

02:27.687 --> 02:29.984
mine.

03:39.134 --> 03:41.180
What?

03:43.764 --> 03:45.932
The fuck, you're pissed?
It's our fucking property,

03:45.974 --> 03:47.936
and you have me arrested?!

03:47.978 --> 03:50.062
Not "our".

03:50.104 --> 03:52.774
I will cut you off
without a cent!

03:52.816 --> 03:54.818
You think I won't?

04:05.913 --> 04:09.789
Mom, are you all right?

04:09.831 --> 04:12.669
Mom, are you okay?

04:12.711 --> 04:14.336
Mom?

04:18.966 --> 04:21.718
Mom?

04:28.309 --> 04:31.855
I hear them too.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.865
All I want in this world is...

04:41.906 --> 04:44.992
is what's best for my baby.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.879
Fucking cops!

04:57.923 --> 05:00.716
Where the hell have you been?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.718
Walking five miles.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.971
Five miles?

05:05.012 --> 05:06.973
You were right. Okay?

05:07.014 --> 05:09.850
I'm right? You think
that's what I'm looking for?

05:13.855 --> 05:16.149
Made a mistake.

05:16.189 --> 05:18.819
You learn from it?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.821
Yeah.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.365
okay, now come here,
give your mom a hug.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.110
Boys.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.742
Hands up! Don't move!

06:09.826 --> 06:12.706
I'm a capable woman, gentlemen, but
I can only do one or the other.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.833
Shit!

06:14.875 --> 06:18.461
Well, a capable woman can read
a no-trespassing sign I take it.

06:18.502 --> 06:21.298
- Yeah.
- You know, that fish badge

06:21.338 --> 06:23.382
is no get-out-of-jail-free card.

06:23.423 --> 06:25.802
We're within our rights
to take you in.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.555
I won't stop you. Just, uh...

06:28.596 --> 06:30.598
just take a look in there first.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.019
Jesus Christ!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.437
What the fuck is that?

06:39.482 --> 06:42.401
You were right.

06:42.442 --> 06:45.612
This is so fucked up.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.990
You should have seen the half
with the head on it.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.254
Hmm...

07:01.295 --> 07:04.673
Well, aren't you
a pretty kitten heel?

07:04.716 --> 07:07.552
Your sensible shoes step
into another pile of shit?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.677
- Sheriff.
- You know,

07:09.721 --> 07:11.680
a heads-up would have
walked you through the gates.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.682
Hate to be a bother.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.937
And I hate aged rib eye.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.480
Your deputies
were more than helpful.

07:19.521 --> 07:23.235
Well,
you'll be the first to say that.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.446
Sworn.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.156
Yes, sir.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.326
Yeah. I understand.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.081
Mayor's office. It is believed
to be in the best interest

07:37.124 --> 07:40.752
of the public to withhold
this discovery from the media.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.629
Why do I feel as though
that is a flagrant misuse

07:43.670 --> 07:45.632
of the word "public"?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.634
Not the first time

07:47.675 --> 07:49.761
the First Amendment's
been liberally interpreted

07:49.802 --> 07:52.012
when the Godfrey name
might be printed.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.475
How long have you been
with Fish and Wildlife?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.230
If there's something you want
to ask me, Tom, go ahead.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.399
I would if I thought
you'd answer me.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.444
Hmm, "Quid pro quo
is it now, Clarice?"

08:05.485 --> 08:09.906
I don't speak Spanish.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.574
We are looking for an animal,
are we not, Doctor?

08:14.535 --> 08:17.079
You know the thing people
get wrong about the weatherman?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.081
He's usually right.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.173
Yes, sir?

08:27.213 --> 08:29.175
Some developments.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.278
Well, aren't you my hero?

08:49.321 --> 08:52.822
- <i>Hi.</i>
- I swear, if it got

08:52.865 --> 08:55.326
any more boring here,
I was about to do some homework.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.701
Shudder.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.788
<i>Perish the thought.</i>

08:58.830 --> 09:01.375
Where's Roman?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.835
Look at you.
You took the bus.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.836
Miss Independent,

09:05.879 --> 09:09.298
I like it, but, um...
something tells me

09:09.341 --> 09:11.841
you're not just here for
my sunny personality, are you?

09:16.931 --> 09:18.850
Here we go.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.936
I set them aside for you.

09:21.976 --> 09:23.937
Believe it or not,
good taste is very rare

09:23.980 --> 09:25.940
here at the general store
on both sides

09:25.980 --> 09:28.067
of the counter,
so when we find it,

09:28.109 --> 09:30.235
we have to defend it. You know,

09:30.278 --> 09:32.072
the right piece of jewelry
can turn a girl into a woman.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.575
Not to mention...
a little rebellion.

09:45.125 --> 09:49.089
Should we go through
the motions at least?

09:49.129 --> 09:51.091
How was everyone's day?

09:51.130 --> 09:54.052
Every breath, a gift.

09:56.052 --> 09:58.721
Where did you disappear
to, darling?

10:00.892 --> 10:04.229
<i>- I took the bus.</i>
- Seriously?

10:04.269 --> 10:06.480
I'm sorry. What was that?

10:09.234 --> 10:13.028
<i>- I took the bus.</i>
- Quit being so goddamn literal.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.533
Why on earth would you take
the bus anywhere?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.534
And without my permission...

10:19.576 --> 10:21.995
Give her a break.
Jesus, I don't even know

10:22.038 --> 10:26.332
- how to do that! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- I'm sorry. Is this a joke to you?

10:28.793 --> 10:32.380
Oh, Shelley darling, earrings!
What have you

10:32.423 --> 10:35.134
done to yourself?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.385
Did you have

10:37.427 --> 10:40.014
any hand in this?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.267
No.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.773
I'm simply perplexed.

10:50.774 --> 10:53.360
You want to make
a mockery of yourself?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.653
You would connive
to demean yourself.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.167
Do you know what
true deformity is?

11:07.206 --> 11:09.750
The most intolerable

11:09.793 --> 11:12.589
and repellent of them all?

11:12.629 --> 11:14.173
Stupidity.

11:23.139 --> 11:26.186
- Now remove them.
- Stop.

11:26.225 --> 11:28.894
I'm sorry.
Was that a command?

11:28.937 --> 11:31.690
- Leave her alone.
- Or what?

11:34.735 --> 11:38.279
- Shelley, remove them!
- Leave her alone.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.326
So help me, you will end up
in the fucking gutter!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.451
No, I won't.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.788
- Do you think I'm kidding?
- No.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.125
I know you're lying.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.086
I've seen it.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.254
Seen what?

11:54.297 --> 11:57.091
The will.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.635
This summer, when Annette didn't
like the way you talked to her--

12:00.677 --> 12:02.803
not everyone likes
being called that--

12:02.846 --> 12:05.807
she took me into her office
and showed me the will

12:05.850 --> 12:07.850
just to spite you.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.691
It's all mine.

12:12.730 --> 12:15.485
I'm sole beneficiary.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.653
And on my 18th birthday, I gain
control of the entire trust.

12:18.697 --> 12:22.408
Every cent.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.245
It's my house,

12:25.284 --> 12:27.663
it's my money...

12:27.706 --> 12:30.206
and it always was.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.350
All you had to do...

12:48.393 --> 12:50.729
was leave her alone.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.710
Good night, darlings.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.090
Hey, Shelley.

14:33.663 --> 14:35.707
Is that blood?

14:55.226 --> 14:57.230
Yeah?

14:59.355 --> 15:02.735
Okay. Okay, calm, calm down.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.028
I'll be there.

15:08.072 --> 15:10.701
Is that Olivia?

15:10.744 --> 15:13.162
No.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.808
In the end, it was JR
who totally lost his grip.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.440
I guess he made some pretty
wild accusations about her.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.481
Like what?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.485
Dad wouldn't say.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.613
Must have been some
serious crazy person stuff.

15:46.653 --> 15:48.447
There was a suicide letter too.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.825
They found it the next day.

15:50.865 --> 15:52.951
Do you have any idea
what it might have said?

15:52.993 --> 15:54.870
I don't know.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.109
<i>Norman. It's a funny thing
how you can look at something</i>

16:25.149 --> 16:28.278
<i>a thousand times</i>
<i>without really seeing it.</i>

16:30.072 --> 16:32.826
<i>This happened to me recently</i>
<i>when I saw the word "gentleman"</i>

16:32.865 --> 16:34.951
<i>in print,</i>
<i>and for whatever reason,</i>

16:34.994 --> 16:37.120
<i>for the first time...</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:38.956
<i>really saw it.</i>

16:41.960 --> 16:44.586
<i>Gentleman.</i>

16:46.422 --> 16:50.384
<i>I thought... that's my brother.</i>

16:50.426 --> 16:53.596
<i>A gentleman</i>
<i>is my brother, Norman.</i>

16:55.974 --> 16:59.100
<i>She won't let that stand.</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:01.562
<i>She will bring out</i>
<i>all the worst in you.</i>

17:01.604 --> 17:05.272
<i>By the time you realize it,</i>

17:05.316 --> 17:07.942
<i>it's too late...</i>

17:07.984 --> 17:11.990
<i>because she's already destroyed</i>
<i>the best.</i>

17:12.029 --> 17:15.534
<i>I could see the look in your eye</i>
<i>the last time we talked,</i>

17:15.576 --> 17:17.702
<i>but under the circumstances,</i>

17:17.742 --> 17:20.832
<i>I hope you will understand</i>

17:20.874 --> 17:23.710
<i>how seriously I mean this.</i>

17:23.750 --> 17:26.251
<i>Do not let her destroy you.</i>

17:28.297 --> 17:30.589
<i>JR.</i>

18:21.141 --> 18:23.978
You're stronger
than I'd ever hoped.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.365
I know. Go home,

18:36.405 --> 18:38.866
take a couple of days off.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.912
Go home!

18:54.673 --> 18:56.634
Hm!

18:56.675 --> 18:59.511
I was thinking
about releasing him.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.767
Where was I
gonna release him to?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.980
I don't know.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.191
At the risk of sounding
like a broken record...

19:11.231 --> 19:14.944
Jesus Christ!

20:16.632 --> 20:18.592
I have a lead.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.594
I think something's going on
at the White Tower.

20:20.634 --> 20:22.930
I don't know
if it's connected or not,

20:22.971 --> 20:24.932
but I can get us in.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.310
What?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.065
No.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.106
What do you mean, no?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.567
It's over.

20:38.569 --> 20:40.529
What are you talking about?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.740
This is over. We're done.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.453
Why?

20:48.497 --> 20:50.124
What?

20:50.164 --> 20:53.711
You mean the cops? You said,
"Get rid of 'em" and I did.

20:53.751 --> 20:56.172
What's the problem?

20:56.212 --> 20:58.673
Okay. Okay.

20:58.714 --> 21:01.844
It was stupid.
It was really stupid.

21:01.884 --> 21:03.761
I'm an asshole.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.556
I'm sorry, okay?

21:05.596 --> 21:07.598
But come on. Think about
what you're doing.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.353
You can't walk away
over a stupid thing like that.

21:11.394 --> 21:14.314
You can't walk away from this.

21:19.193 --> 21:22.529
- Will you fucking say something?!
- You should go.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.575
There's no good for you here.

21:24.615 --> 21:26.576
You should get away
from all this death...

21:26.617 --> 21:28.621
this town and your name.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.665
Make it all clean.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.669
I don't know...

21:35.711 --> 21:37.711
figure it out from there.

21:41.048 --> 21:43.134
I bet you'd like that.

21:43.175 --> 21:45.846
I bet you'd find that
very convenient,

21:45.886 --> 21:47.890
you gypsy piece of shit!

21:50.601 --> 21:53.229
You know, if you fuck my cousin,
I'll kill you.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.358
You're not better than me.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.844
Oh!

22:24.884 --> 22:27.096
Hello.

22:27.136 --> 22:29.096
Good afternoon.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.851
Come in.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.894
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.900
- Sit, please.
- Oh, uh, well, we haven't officially met.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.736
- Uh, my name--
- I'm sorry.

22:44.695 --> 22:46.655
Our sons are friends.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.909
Yeah, I know your son.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.163
Not much meat on his ribs,
but he didn't say no to seconds.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.835
Uh...

22:57.875 --> 23:01.377
Casper, come on. Sorry.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.217
Down, buddy.
Down. Down, down,

23:04.258 --> 23:07.259
down, baby.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.096
Uh, I also knew
your cousin. Was it?

23:10.137 --> 23:12.973
- Yeah, Vince.
- Right, hmm, well...

23:13.017 --> 23:17.563
he and I had sort of a...
an arrangement.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.651
You see, I have this condition,

23:22.692 --> 23:26.028
and doctors are
of not much help for this...

23:26.070 --> 23:29.405
particular condition,
but, but there is a substance

23:29.449 --> 23:32.701
that provides
a great relief which is...

23:32.743 --> 23:35.079
which is far more easier

23:35.122 --> 23:38.500
for your people
to procure than...

23:38.540 --> 23:42.255
than myself presently.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.631
I don't need it,
you understand?

23:47.423 --> 23:50.135
But it certainly does take
the edge off, as they say.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.847
How much do you have left?

23:53.891 --> 23:56.643
Uh... Oh! I don't know.

23:56.683 --> 23:58.644
I suppose I would
have to check.

23:58.685 --> 24:00.771
Five thousand a bottle.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.986
That's, uh... substantially
more than what Vince asked for.

24:06.028 --> 24:09.240
Vince thought with his dick.
The stuff you're talking about

24:09.280 --> 24:11.365
isn't ginkgo biloba.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.161
The stuff you're talking about
means knocking on some doors

24:14.201 --> 24:17.663
that were a part of my life way
before I had Peter. Five thousand.

24:17.704 --> 24:20.625
I don't go lower than that
to knock on those doors.

24:20.665 --> 24:24.962
But, but you, uh...

24:25.005 --> 24:28.548
you, you can get it?

24:28.592 --> 24:30.970
It's okay,

24:31.009 --> 24:34.265
- there's plenty.
- Uh...

24:34.307 --> 24:39.103
- you don't mind if I just-- Just one.
- Of course not.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.442
I wouldn't overdo it, though.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.319
- Yeah!
- Ha! Ha! Five thousand dollars?

24:48.362 --> 24:50.779
- Champagne for all my friends!
- Ha! Ha! Oh, my god, Lynda.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.787
I hope you know what you're doing, because
these people are not to be fucked with.

24:56.827 --> 24:58.913
No one's fucking anyone.
We just both simply have

24:58.954 --> 25:00.914
what the other wants.
It's business.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.041
<i>Johai,</i> as in the essence

25:03.085 --> 25:05.211
of pure bullshit. Ha! Ha! Ha!

25:05.252 --> 25:07.212
It's what she wants.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.387
- I saw Roman's hand.
- Oh, I know, I know.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.391
He hasn't lifted anything
heavier than his pecker

25:17.432 --> 25:19.643
- since the day he was born.
- He's capable of a lot more.

25:19.683 --> 25:22.729
Yeah, but, you know, the only one he's
interested in hurting is himself.

25:22.769 --> 25:25.897
Peter knows that now.
He had to find out for himself.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.567
- What about this vargulf?
- Nature will take its course.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.569
That's what I tried
to tell your son!

25:31.613 --> 25:34.450
He has to find out for himself.

25:34.490 --> 25:36.616
What about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.621
Ha! Ha! Ha! So what, we're
telling real scary stories now?

25:39.663 --> 25:42.164
- Yes!
- Yeah, right.

26:09.151 --> 26:12.819
What did you find out?

26:12.863 --> 26:16.990
That adulthood is just like
high school with mortgages.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.992
When did you learn
about mortgages?

26:19.036 --> 26:20.996
Shut up.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.711
<i>Shit!</i>

26:29.755 --> 26:31.882
<i>- So your dad and Olivia were...?</i>
<i>- Doctor</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:35.344
<i>and patient. JR really lost it.</i>

26:35.384 --> 26:39.346
<i>In other news,</i>
<i>that guy we found on the road...</i>

26:39.390 --> 26:42.057
stabbed himself
in the brain last night.

26:44.184 --> 26:46.480
Oh!

26:55.989 --> 26:58.365
Roman seemed weird today.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.367
Yeah, he's pissed at me.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.202
Why?

27:02.246 --> 27:04.538
Because there's
a giant Roman-shaped blind spot

27:04.582 --> 27:07.000
in the way that Roman
sees things.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.461
What happened Saturday night?

27:09.501 --> 27:11.797
Were you there
when he was arrested?

27:11.836 --> 27:14.467
Ha! Your mom using
the sheriff's department

27:14.508 --> 27:16.759
as a timeout isn't the same
thing as getting arrested.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.182
What are the things
you're leaving out?

27:22.222 --> 27:24.893
You don't need to leave stuff
out just because I'm a girl.

27:29.396 --> 27:31.647
I should sock you.

27:43.827 --> 27:46.582
Um... you want some water?

27:46.624 --> 27:49.000
Sure.

28:11.021 --> 28:13.025
Thanks.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.757
Um...

28:37.798 --> 28:41.554
Do you believe in angels?

28:41.595 --> 28:44.056
It scares my parents

28:44.096 --> 28:47.142
'cause they don't believe me.

28:47.182 --> 28:49.394
But I guess I wouldn't either
in their shoes.

28:51.395 --> 28:53.355
I know it sounds
a little crazy.

28:53.397 --> 28:57.192
It actually sounds
a lot like crazy.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.488
Do you believe me?

29:04.951 --> 29:06.912
I don't know.

29:06.951 --> 29:08.913
Are you just saying
you don't know

29:08.953 --> 29:12.459
because you don't believe me, or
'cause you think I'm crazy or...?

29:12.500 --> 29:15.586
Well... yeah, I think
you're pretty crazy,

29:15.627 --> 29:19.258
but I still don't know.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.894
Well?

29:30.934 --> 29:34.189
Well what?

29:34.230 --> 29:37.357
Are you gonna try and fuck me?

29:37.401 --> 29:40.903
Yeah. Here we are.

29:40.944 --> 29:44.115
What kind of a thing
is that to say?

29:44.155 --> 29:46.910
What is that?

29:51.248 --> 29:53.875
Roman.

29:57.586 --> 29:59.548
What does Roman

29:59.588 --> 30:02.008
have to do with the price
of rice in China?

30:02.048 --> 30:04.509
You know.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.101
Do you like me?

30:15.063 --> 30:18.607
- Are you sure it's not...?
- No, that's, um...

30:18.651 --> 30:22.068
that's actually kind of sexy.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.573
Pervert.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.910
Look, if the dynamite's
already on the tracks

30:28.951 --> 30:31.202
you'd think twice
about stepping on that train.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.957
Smooth talker.

30:40.922 --> 30:44.509
So you're really saying no?

31:58.164 --> 32:00.711
Godfrey Steel.

32:48.423 --> 32:50.425
Shut up and kiss me.

33:10.445 --> 33:12.405
You're Roman Godfrey?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.365
Yeah.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.577
- You're bleeding.
- Close shave.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.579
Hmm, let me see.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.666
- It's fine.
- Hold still.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.876
Keep it clean,

33:24.920 --> 33:26.880
you should live.

33:26.922 --> 33:30.342
I'm Clementine Chasseur.
I'm with the...

33:30.383 --> 33:33.553
You know who I am.

33:33.595 --> 33:36.096
You're the dogcatcher.

33:36.137 --> 33:38.097
May I ask how you come
to know that?

33:38.141 --> 33:40.183
Small pond.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.185
- Is your mother home?
- No.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.189
You expect her?

33:44.230 --> 33:46.692
Speak with you?

33:46.731 --> 33:48.317
Um...

33:53.198 --> 33:55.365
Hey, Shelley.

33:55.406 --> 33:57.742
This is Dr. Chasseur.

33:57.786 --> 34:01.163
- She's here to take a bite
out of the vargulf. - Excuse me?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.500
It's fine.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.801
Please.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.681
Roman, I'd like to ask you
a few questions but before I do

34:17.721 --> 34:19.724
there's something
that I'd like you to do for me.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.983
I want you to think about what
kind of person you want to be.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.443
I'm here because people
are getting hurt.

34:30.485 --> 34:34.197
The more honest you are with me, the more
it will help me do something about it.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.699
So just take a second
and think about that, okay?

34:39.619 --> 34:42.454
I'm... I'm kind of fucked up
right now.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.833
This is a great opportunity
to do something about it.

34:47.793 --> 34:51.338
I don't know
what you're going through...

34:51.380 --> 34:53.507
but I'm not exaggerating
when I say that I'm here

34:53.550 --> 34:56.052
to save people's lives.

34:57.971 --> 35:01.056
What is your association
with Peter Rumancek?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.393
We hang out.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.353
Anything else you want to
tell me about that relationship?

35:08.731 --> 35:11.610
Does Peter believe
he's a werewolf?

35:11.650 --> 35:14.402
No. People just
say that about him.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.864
- Any idea why people would say
these things? - They're afraid of him.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.994
You should hear the things
they say about us.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.871
I guess you have.

35:23.914 --> 35:27.041
Do they have any reason
to be afraid?

35:27.083 --> 35:29.585
No.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.588
Peter would never hurt anyone.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.422
Why did you go to the site
of the first murder?

35:36.592 --> 35:38.552
I followed Peter.

35:38.594 --> 35:41.056
And what was Peter doing there?

35:41.097 --> 35:44.349
- Rubbernecking.
- Did you dig up Lisa Willoughby?

35:44.391 --> 35:46.268
No.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.943
Did you dig up Lisa Willoughby?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.570
I said we didn't.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.079
Yeah, we did.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.875
Why?

36:08.916 --> 36:11.795
It was...
it was a ritual or something,

36:11.835 --> 36:15.090
- a gypsy thing, I don't know.
- Roman, desecration of the dead

36:15.132 --> 36:17.675
does not fall under the rubric
of "some gypsy thing".

36:17.717 --> 36:20.052
- It wasn't desecration.
- Then what was it?

36:20.094 --> 36:22.097
Peter thought
he could help her.

36:22.139 --> 36:24.474
- She's dead.
- Yeah.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.476
Peter marches to his own beat.

36:27.518 --> 36:31.271
You used the word "vargulf".
Why did you use that world?

36:34.317 --> 36:36.902
'Cause I don't want you
to bother my sister.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.737
Why do you think
I would bother her?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.199
I don't want you to think
she's the vargulf!

36:41.239 --> 36:45.411
When you use that word, what
exactly do you think it means?

36:49.331 --> 36:51.168
Some...

36:51.208 --> 36:54.128
It's a kind of sickness.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.130
It's like hunger
with no appetite.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.134
Where did you learn that word?

36:59.175 --> 37:02.012
- I don't know where I learned it.
- Where did you learn this word?

37:04.347 --> 37:06.306
Peter.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.893
What can you tell me about
an experiment being conducted

37:09.936 --> 37:12.688
at the Godfrey Institute
of Biomedical Technologies

37:12.731 --> 37:14.773
called Ouroboros?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.945
I know that symbol
means something.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.530
I mean, every symbol
means something, but that one

37:21.572 --> 37:23.992
means something.
I don't know, something...

37:24.034 --> 37:27.079
happening.

37:34.835 --> 37:38.463
I see things sometimes.

37:38.505 --> 37:41.217
Do you know what it means?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.762
I can't tell you
what it means to you.

37:43.802 --> 37:46.722
I can help you.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.516
Your cooperation
is very helpful.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.061
I can do more.
The White Tower, Ouroboros.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.106
I can find out what it is!

37:54.146 --> 37:56.858
My father built that place!
My name is Godfrey!

37:56.900 --> 37:59.068
A name is only a name.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.197
It's good that you want
to help, Roman.

38:02.239 --> 38:04.489
It's very good of you,
but you can't.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.327
Why not?

38:08.369 --> 38:11.539
God doesn't want you
to be happy.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.126
He wants you to be strong.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.463
Roman, would you care

38:18.503 --> 38:20.632
to introduce our guest?

38:23.550 --> 38:25.552
I'm Dr. Chasseur.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.556
I'm on the board
of the biomedical center,

38:28.597 --> 38:30.516
as you're well aware.

38:30.556 --> 38:33.728
Could I ask your business here?

38:33.768 --> 38:36.521
Just due diligence, ma'am.
Didn't mean to intrude.

38:36.563 --> 38:40.485
Oh! Say no more.
Of course we would be thrilled

38:40.525 --> 38:42.737
to offer whatever
you would find of assistance.

38:42.777 --> 38:45.824
Not a pleasant business at all.
Anything we can do.

38:45.864 --> 38:47.742
May I offer you

38:47.784 --> 38:50.619
a tea or perhaps a brandy?

38:50.661 --> 38:53.081
Things are getting
frightful outside.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.001
I've seen worse.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.670
Size elevens?

38:59.710 --> 39:03.757
Well, aren't you
a pretty kitten heel?

39:03.800 --> 39:06.469
They do leave
quite an impression.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.056
Roman darling,

39:11.099 --> 39:14.559
there's not a shortage
of coasters in this house.

39:14.601 --> 39:16.855
Sorry.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.023
What happened to your face?

39:19.065 --> 39:22.318
It's just a scrape.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.320
Silly monkey.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.952
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, Roman.</i>

39:31.994 --> 39:33.954
Uh, Marie is hysterical.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.956
This place is a zoo.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.458
I haven't been able
to get away all day.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.003
Um... do you have any idea

39:41.045 --> 39:43.005
<i>where Letha might have gone?</i>

39:43.047 --> 39:46.634
Yeah, I have an idea.

39:46.675 --> 39:50.012
Well, if you see her,
can you call me?

39:52.306 --> 39:54.641
Thanks.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.820
It's nice to see a man
take what he wants.

40:07.864 --> 40:10.074
It's nice to be silent
like this

40:10.114 --> 40:12.117
and not be asked
what I'm thinking.

40:12.159 --> 40:16.121
I know what you're thinking.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.333
What's that?

40:20.793 --> 40:24.172
You haven't felt this right
since you can't remember.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.802
<i>It makes you feel terrible.</i>

40:29.844 --> 40:33.347
<i>He's still my brother.</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:35.806
He's still my husband.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.065
I didn't know you then.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.237
But I do now. I know.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.702
My whole life I've tried
to live a certain way.

40:57.038 --> 41:00.041
I had a name...

41:00.083 --> 41:02.418
that meant something.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.713
Met a girl...

41:05.755 --> 41:08.882
and that meant something.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.260
I tried to do right by it all,

41:11.302 --> 41:13.471
be a good man,

41:13.512 --> 41:16.056
take the hard path
over the easy.

41:20.061 --> 41:23.273
<i>I'm not a good man.</i>

41:34.992 --> 41:38.036
You know exactly
what you need to do.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.670
It will feel wrong,

41:45.710 --> 41:48.880
but it will be right.

41:48.922 --> 41:51.967
It will feel like cowardice,

41:52.010 --> 41:54.137
but it will be brave.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.681
You will go home...

41:58.724 --> 42:02.186
and it will feel this way
because you are a good man.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.188
<i>But I'm not.</i>

42:04.230 --> 42:06.606
<i>I'm gonna tell Marie</i>
<i>that I'm leaving her.</i>

42:10.068 --> 42:12.447
It got a little cold.

42:12.489 --> 42:14.824
I thought you'd be earlier.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.911
I suppose all
good things take time.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.000
What is all this?

42:24.041 --> 42:26.001
Welcome home, "Dad".

42:41.559 --> 42:43.561
You smell nice.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.148
You smell sweet, like a puppy.

43:01.538 --> 43:03.873
Um...

43:16.885 --> 43:18.929
Are you serious?

43:20.931 --> 43:22.891
Uh, um...

43:25.061 --> 43:27.355
You should know that, uh...

43:27.396 --> 43:31.025
I'm not a very good boyfriend
to have.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.527
Don't be
such a big hairy idiot.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.905
You smell so good.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.577
What I mean is that what
you're talking about is a...

43:42.579 --> 43:45.706
...that's a whole deal
and everything.

43:45.748 --> 43:49.043
What? Fucking?

43:49.085 --> 43:51.795
Huh?

44:09.021 --> 44:11.983
Do you want to know the first
moment I knew it would be you?

44:14.943 --> 44:16.945
No.

44:49.018 --> 44:52.981
Liars! Fucking liars!

44:59.364 --> 45:01.364
Ah...

45:01.407 --> 45:04.076
Okay!

45:04.117 --> 45:06.119
Ah...

45:34.565 --> 45:36.650
Roman?

45:36.693 --> 45:39.487
There's no light!

45:39.527 --> 45:43.074
Yeah, the whole
neighborhood's dark.

45:43.114 --> 45:45.367
Uh, are you all right?

45:47.161 --> 45:50.081
You wanna come here and talk
about cute boys all night?

45:50.121 --> 45:53.418
- Or do you want to dance?
- No.

45:58.505 --> 46:01.592
- It's just rain!
- Roman, maybe you better come inside.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.387
- I should go.
- No, come on,

46:05.429 --> 46:08.599
I'll get you out
of those wet clothes.

46:08.641 --> 46:10.809
Come on!

46:35.041 --> 46:37.001
Well, you have the legs for it.

46:37.043 --> 46:39.045
Sorry.

47:03.612 --> 47:06.114
What's wrong?

47:08.159 --> 47:10.452
Roman.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.498
My god, what happened?

47:13.539 --> 47:16.751
It's okay. It's okay.

47:16.793 --> 47:18.918
- I should go.
- You keep saying that.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.713
You're here.

47:21.755 --> 47:25.092
Why don't you tell me
about it, huh?

47:25.134 --> 47:27.094
Huh?

47:27.135 --> 47:29.597
Maybe you should talk about it.

47:29.639 --> 47:32.684
Roman?

47:37.396 --> 47:39.606
Huh? What's wrong?

47:39.648 --> 47:42.025
I'm ugly.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.612
What?

47:44.652 --> 47:47.239
- I'm an ugly person.
- Oh, Roman.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.246
I have an ugliness
it's impossible to love.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.291
That's not true,

47:57.333 --> 48:00.460
that's not true.

48:00.503 --> 48:03.547
My god!
How could you think that?

48:13.139 --> 48:16.101
You're beautiful.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.936
Yes.

49:12.157 --> 49:16.036
Really?

49:18.371 --> 49:20.750
You're crazy, you know that?

49:29.467 --> 49:32.344
Jesus!

49:42.480 --> 49:45.065
Oh!

49:48.360 --> 49:50.655
You ought to be locked up.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.505
Your turn.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.219
Roman?

50:20.851 --> 50:24.563
Roman?

50:24.605 --> 50:26.815
Roman, are you okay?

50:29.943 --> 50:32.822
Can you untie me?

50:32.864 --> 50:36.157
Roman? Can you untie me?
I don't like this.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.831
Okay, untie me. Ah!

50:41.873 --> 50:45.543
Roman, can you untie me, please?

50:45.583 --> 50:48.585
Ah! What are you doing?
Get off me!

50:48.628 --> 50:50.588
Ah! Roman!

50:50.630 --> 50:52.172
Stop! Ah!
