00:24.437 --> 00:27.265
Oh my God, Based God messaged me.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.098
Lil B?

01:32.530 --> 01:33.867
You think it's really him?

01:37.350 --> 01:39.600
d Trolling

01:51.273 --> 01:52.106
Stop.

01:54.310 --> 01:56.544
I thought you like that.

01:56.579 --> 01:58.779
I got something for you.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.351
Get off.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.636
I have work in the morning.

02:03.922 --> 02:04.755
God stop.

02:07.191 --> 02:08.627
Just go away.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.495
Do you actually want me to leave?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.592
I can exit the building.

02:10.627 --> 02:12.930
I'm just wondering how seriously I should

02:12.965 --> 02:14.960
take your unconscious demands.

02:14.995 --> 02:15.793
No.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.820
Shut the fuck up, I'm tryin' to sleep.

02:19.855 --> 02:22.039
Yeah well you just hit me.

02:22.074 --> 02:22.872
What?

02:24.059 --> 02:25.093
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

02:25.128 --> 02:26.092
I'm just tryin' to cuddle with you

02:26.127 --> 02:30.294
and you're treating me like
some sort of rapey home invader.

02:30.575 --> 02:32.154
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

02:32.189 --> 02:33.867
Were you abused as a child or something

02:33.902 --> 02:36.872
'cause you're just always
acting so aggressive.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.843
I don't know if that's
repressed anger towards me

02:39.878 --> 02:42.093
or something but it's just.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.525
No.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.788
Do you want some water?

02:45.823 --> 02:46.621
No.

03:17.443 --> 03:19.788
I got you some anyway.

03:19.823 --> 03:22.133
Hydration is important.

03:31.275 --> 03:33.525
You wanna watch Shark Tank?

03:35.634 --> 03:37.783
You don't even care.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.148
You know how stressful my job is.

03:40.183 --> 03:41.961
You've expressed that.

03:41.996 --> 03:42.794
Daily.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.418
See you don't even get it.

03:47.453 --> 03:49.855
It's not particularly complicated.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.699
- If I was in the hospital
I honestly don't even

03:51.734 --> 03:53.361
think you would come visit me.

03:53.396 --> 03:54.350
Why do you say that?

03:54.385 --> 03:58.552
I'd be there and I'd have one
of those bear shaped balloons

03:58.704 --> 04:00.204
and I'd be crying.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.031
- You don't even trust me you
won't even come inside me.

04:07.066 --> 04:09.274
We can talk about that.

04:09.309 --> 04:10.947
It's been three fucking years.

04:10.982 --> 04:12.585
Why am I even on the pill?

04:19.786 --> 04:21.616
Risk management I guess you know.

04:21.651 --> 04:25.619
Just not leaving an opportunity
for something to happen.

04:25.654 --> 04:28.454
I've just left myself exposed

04:30.521 --> 04:32.401
too many times.

04:32.436 --> 04:34.450
So you don't trust me?

04:36.727 --> 04:38.144
No I mean I do.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.132
I'm sorry I love you.

05:08.919 --> 05:10.702
Knock 'em dead today.

05:10.737 --> 05:13.711
See ya later

05:24.359 --> 05:25.776
Alright see ya.

05:59.987 --> 06:02.018
Yo man hold up.

06:02.053 --> 06:03.289
Lookin' sharp Mr. Worthington.

06:03.324 --> 06:04.789
You know it dog.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.164
- How those stock tips
workin' out for you homie?

06:08.199 --> 06:11.175
Well company just filed for bankruptcy.

06:11.210 --> 06:12.349
Ain't no thing.

06:12.384 --> 06:15.551
It's all a numbers game remember that.

06:16.963 --> 06:18.130
That's real.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.393

06:44.422 --> 06:46.304
d Jump

06:47.653 --> 06:49.384
I mean I love her and everything

06:49.419 --> 06:52.612
but next year when we're on tour in Europe

06:52.647 --> 06:54.907
and I'm surrounded by Anna
Kournikova look a likes,

06:54.942 --> 06:56.988
I might have to smash just once.

06:57.023 --> 06:58.735
- I don't know you got
a good thing going man

06:58.770 --> 07:00.083
in my opinion.

07:00.118 --> 07:01.137
Yeah but with you,

07:01.172 --> 07:03.118
if you see a bad bitch
walking down the street,

07:03.153 --> 07:04.102
you could just link her with somebody

07:04.137 --> 07:06.192
you've already been with.

07:06.227 --> 07:07.105
Yeah more or less

07:07.140 --> 07:09.193
but fashion trends tend to shift

07:09.228 --> 07:11.882
on a fairly annual basis.

07:15.429 --> 07:18.919
- If I see a hot Asian
girl with green hair

07:18.954 --> 07:21.430
walking down the street

07:21.465 --> 07:24.132
or a Jewish girl with a fat ass,

07:25.042 --> 07:28.068
it kills me that I actually
haven't been there.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.053
I'm just making shit up.

07:30.088 --> 07:32.332
Yeah I mean I guess we're both dating

07:32.367 --> 07:34.203
what's quote on quote a basic bitch

07:34.238 --> 07:36.005
but what you have to remember Trey

07:36.040 --> 07:40.051
is those Coach bags and
outfits from Anthropologie

07:40.086 --> 07:41.503
signify a greater white privilege

07:41.538 --> 07:44.020
that can help send our
kids to the right college.

07:44.055 --> 07:46.502
- Or you can just give them
the sense of entitlement

07:46.537 --> 07:47.823
that they need to succeed.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.389
Yeah rich white people tell their kids

07:50.424 --> 07:52.551
not to view the doctor
as an authority figure

07:52.586 --> 07:53.349
but as a sounding board

07:53.384 --> 07:55.959
for their independent concerns.

07:55.994 --> 07:57.459
CEO in training.

07:59.339 --> 08:01.341
Well yeah at least kids have the internet

08:01.376 --> 08:02.535
these days growing up.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.532
Maybe that'll give them
some sort of perspective.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.534
Yeah I wish I had that a little earlier.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.501
Then maybe I would of
masturbated with lube

08:08.536 --> 08:10.427
prior to the age of 24.

08:10.462 --> 08:14.097
- You're still masturbating
on the internet though.

08:14.132 --> 08:17.733
- Yeah Yahoo answers I
feel wasn't really a thing

08:17.768 --> 08:18.650
before '07.

08:20.254 --> 08:23.822
But by then I already
had my technique down.

08:23.857 --> 08:27.548
I feel you.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.114
Yeah it's like we're doomed

08:29.149 --> 08:30.611
but if we ignore the haters

08:30.646 --> 08:34.813
and fucking impregnate these
girls we'll be set you know?

08:35.486 --> 08:36.990
If I put my seed in that,

08:37.025 --> 08:40.047
the kid will stagnate in a
mother fucking community garden.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.614
None of that with Monica.

08:41.649 --> 08:43.111
You see things brah.

08:43.145 --> 08:46.885
- Basic bitches have the support
system to win in the end.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.802
That's beautiful man.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.277
You know I'm here right.

08:55.312 --> 08:58.070
And I'm gonna be a voice for
the women you're abusing.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.214
Maybe no one's ever
said that to you before

09:00.249 --> 09:02.096
but I'm not just gonna stand around

09:02.131 --> 09:05.045
and let you fuckin' spout your
self congratulatory bull shit

09:05.080 --> 09:06.491
in my community.

09:07.893 --> 09:08.726
Feminism.

09:09.559 --> 09:10.357
Yeah but if you're a white feminist,

09:10.392 --> 09:12.416
you're just gonna take the
liberties you've been given,

09:12.451 --> 09:14.603
merge them with your white
privilege patriarchal,

09:14.638 --> 09:17.559
super structure, plug
yourself in as an affiliate

09:17.594 --> 09:20.480
of that machine and leave
us minorities out to dry!

09:20.515 --> 09:21.695
That's fucked up.

09:21.730 --> 09:22.841
Oh for real.

09:22.876 --> 09:25.253
Wait what are you talking about?

09:25.288 --> 09:28.158
I totally give you the white privilege.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.028
Well my friend Sarah could use some.

09:31.063 --> 09:32.165
She needs a sublet.

09:35.322 --> 09:38.291
This is private property.

09:38.326 --> 09:40.265
That was a very bay area experience.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.694
A lot of progressive
ideas floating in a sea

09:42.729 --> 09:44.277
of repressed anger.

10:07.549 --> 10:10.011
Oh hey did you go to CCA?

10:10.046 --> 10:11.428
No what's that?

10:12.637 --> 10:14.356
Oh it's an art school.

10:14.391 --> 10:16.174
People always say that.

10:16.209 --> 10:17.957
That specifically?

10:17.992 --> 10:18.790
No.

11:20.738 --> 11:22.248
Who are you?

11:22.283 --> 11:25.616
I am Richard Nullman of The Grid Gang.

11:29.891 --> 11:31.378
- You're the one
who sent me those messages?

11:31.413 --> 11:32.665
Precisely.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.355
I've summoned you here because
we need a little new blood

11:35.390 --> 11:37.504
on the trolling scene.

11:37.539 --> 11:40.114
Lately it's become infected by posers

11:40.149 --> 11:42.546
from the steampunk community.

11:42.581 --> 11:45.386
- Are they posing as
trolls or steam punks?

11:45.421 --> 11:48.323
Don't even get me started.

11:48.358 --> 11:51.724
Those fucking little cancers
are fucking themselves.

11:51.759 --> 11:54.807
So we'll see how much cred they have.

11:55.886 --> 12:00.006
When we've deleted their
pathetic little Etsy stores.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.714
Oh yes they'll be punished
for their insolence

12:02.749 --> 12:03.964
believe you me.

12:05.232 --> 12:06.156
Wait what?

12:06.191 --> 12:08.308
The point is that we need fresh blood

12:08.343 --> 12:10.139
on the trolling scene.

12:10.174 --> 12:11.935
We need people like you.

12:13.937 --> 12:16.616
I saw the way you tracked that girl

12:16.651 --> 12:20.414
and you're good but you
could be much better.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.319
With the right training of course.

12:22.354 --> 12:25.243
You see I'm something of a team builder.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.455
You could say that I'm a water elemental.

12:28.490 --> 12:31.633
But you, you're lava and together brother,

12:32.793 --> 12:35.043
we're gonna burn shit down.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.959
Welcome to my home.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.702
I call it the Null lair.

12:52.737 --> 12:55.552
No this is a nice place man.

12:55.587 --> 12:57.696
Do you mind me asking
how much you pay for it?

12:57.731 --> 13:01.898
- Well it's 5,200 a month but
I share it with my two lovers

13:02.979 --> 13:05.552
so then it's only 1730 per person.

13:05.587 --> 13:08.091
You pay that much for a two bedroom?

13:08.126 --> 13:11.285
- How long have you been
in San Francisco again?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.951
I was actually originally born here my-

13:12.986 --> 13:13.951
Grid Gang!

13:18.862 --> 13:21.945
Hi I'm Derek and this is Stephanie.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.177
I'm Odyn.

13:25.174 --> 13:26.713
Richard who is he?

13:26.748 --> 13:29.080
We weren't really
informed you were coming.

13:29.115 --> 13:30.027
Coming?

13:30.062 --> 13:33.124
I think you both knew this was coming.

13:33.159 --> 13:36.238
Don't tell me you haven't
seen the writing on the wall.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.377
We've all been getting a
little too comfortable.

13:39.412 --> 13:42.875
We need someone to come in
and shake things up a bit.

13:42.910 --> 13:45.130
He's from Oakland.

13:45.165 --> 13:46.202
Oh yeah!

13:46.237 --> 13:47.577
I'm turnin' shit up.

13:47.612 --> 13:48.887
I'm turnin' shit up!

13:48.922 --> 13:50.163
I think I like him!

13:50.198 --> 13:52.881
d Trolling

13:52.916 --> 13:56.313
This is The Grid Gang manifesto Odyn.

13:56.348 --> 13:58.327
Wikipedia says that a troll

13:58.362 --> 14:01.195
is someone who posts
deliberately off topic,

14:01.230 --> 14:05.382
misleading, or inflammatory
messages in an online community

14:05.417 --> 14:09.549
such as a discussion forum,
chat room, or even a blog.

14:10.590 --> 14:14.757
But in reality what we do
is so much more than that.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.586
We need to wake people up.

14:18.621 --> 14:20.790
Civilization has tried very hard

14:20.825 --> 14:23.484
to coddle us with its support systems

14:23.519 --> 14:25.151
and it's agriculture

14:26.372 --> 14:29.253
and as beautiful as this world is,

14:29.288 --> 14:30.836
it's also too easy.

14:32.359 --> 14:35.449
Society is like an overprotective mother.

14:35.484 --> 14:38.116
Pampering us and making us weak.

14:38.964 --> 14:43.131
We are here to rip those
support systems away.

14:43.276 --> 14:45.348
You may not fear the beast

14:45.383 --> 14:48.466
but you shall fear me because I troll

14:49.765 --> 14:52.348
and I troll because I love you.

14:53.735 --> 14:56.701
Welcome to The Grid Gang Odyn.

14:56.736 --> 15:00.572
Now let's see what you've got.

15:05.115 --> 15:07.644
- One minute the whole
world is gonna think

15:07.679 --> 15:10.946
that Iggy Azalea has been
charged with tax evasion.

15:10.981 --> 15:13.327
Well done my pet.

15:13.362 --> 15:15.210
d The Starlight is in my eyes

15:15.245 --> 15:18.152
d I won't tell if you touch me baby

15:18.187 --> 15:19.772
Yeah just say it sucks.

15:19.807 --> 15:21.296
Tell him he sucks.

15:21.331 --> 15:23.651
Tell him that he fucks his mother.

15:23.686 --> 15:24.449
Troll him.

15:24.484 --> 15:25.871
- And his sister, and
his sister both of them.

15:28.117 --> 15:29.831
- And you
should feel bad about it.

15:29.866 --> 15:31.020
This song was from my heart.

15:31.055 --> 15:35.138
- And this
response is from my diznick.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.571
I knew you were trolling me.

15:38.606 --> 15:39.571
Nice bear.

15:42.184 --> 15:43.017
Yeah so.

15:47.271 --> 15:49.804
- What's with that bear
anyway are you guys friends?

15:49.839 --> 15:51.516
Or are you lovers?

15:51.551 --> 15:52.530
I was talking to that bear

15:52.565 --> 15:54.297
and he told me he didn't
like you very much.

15:56.324 --> 15:58.248
Yeah we don't like you we-

15:58.283 --> 16:00.020
Just shut up!

16:00.055 --> 16:01.256
I know you-

16:01.291 --> 16:02.422
Shut up!

16:02.457 --> 16:03.740
What do you need to do with that gun?

16:03.775 --> 16:05.154
Are you a man?

16:05.189 --> 16:06.499
Gonna show you.

16:06.534 --> 16:07.941
What are you gonna do?

16:07.976 --> 16:09.349
You gonna me feel bad?

16:09.384 --> 16:10.147
Yeah.

16:10.182 --> 16:12.360
- You gonna make me
wish I never picked on you?

16:12.395 --> 16:14.122
You got a plan big man?

16:14.157 --> 16:15.849
You wanna make history?

16:19.951 --> 16:22.051
Classic Grid Gang maneuver.

16:22.086 --> 16:23.240
d Trolling

16:23.275 --> 16:25.813
- It's mostly oat,
banana, and chocolate chip

16:25.848 --> 16:28.115
so it's completely gluten free flour free.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.383
- Wow so the bananas
work like an adhesive?

16:30.418 --> 16:32.015
Yeah it's good you should, here.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.876
You know I bring it to work
'cause it's a good snack

16:34.911 --> 16:36.938
and it doesn't make
everyone all brain dead.

16:36.973 --> 16:38.193
Yeah some co workers of mine

16:38.228 --> 16:39.379
brought these Safeway danishes

16:39.414 --> 16:41.506
and I swear I can imagine
my manager's man boobs

16:41.541 --> 16:43.689
just chafing from all the flour.

16:43.724 --> 16:45.803
I mean it's a fun office snack

16:45.838 --> 16:49.341
but I mean it's like we're all mutating.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.767
We're all infected!

16:50.802 --> 16:53.229
Wait well that' honestly a problem.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.919
Oh they're ready.

16:55.954 --> 17:00.121
- Curses it appears my Bechdel
test was no match for them.

17:08.811 --> 17:09.645
Hello.

17:19.479 --> 17:21.193
These are good.

17:21.228 --> 17:24.609
- You know I got the
recipe from Bill Cosby.

17:24.645 --> 17:27.137
- Yeah the secret ingredient's
a vial of his semen.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.629
- You know you could've
discussed that with us.

17:29.664 --> 17:31.623
We're pretty open minded.

17:31.658 --> 17:33.188
- As long as I don't have
to see your dick we're good.

17:34.405 --> 17:38.184
- We want you face down
buried in my dog's crotch.

17:38.219 --> 17:40.742
You won't see anything.

17:40.777 --> 17:41.677
You know another accuser

17:41.712 --> 17:43.505
came forward today.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.252
- Yeah I don't really trust
those third tier accusers.

17:46.287 --> 17:48.089
They're a little late to the party.

17:48.124 --> 17:49.463
Oh shut up Odyn.

17:49.498 --> 17:50.296
That's just my opinion.

17:50.331 --> 17:52.105
- Where did
you get this weed from?

17:52.140 --> 17:54.339
Odyn knows a delivery guy

17:54.374 --> 17:56.091
and he doesn't card but he's legit.

17:56.126 --> 17:57.808
Can you text me his number?

17:57.843 --> 17:59.225
Yeah right now.

18:02.813 --> 18:05.664
- You know we should all go
on the Steve Wilkos show,

18:05.699 --> 18:08.090
do a little love triangle thing?

18:08.125 --> 18:10.499
I would not agree to that.

18:10.534 --> 18:12.838
I mean it would be funny.

18:12.873 --> 18:17.040
You know we need to jump
start a career somehow Trey.

18:17.778 --> 18:19.595
I understand Odyn I realize

18:19.630 --> 18:23.523
that you wanna be recognized
for your talents baby.

18:23.558 --> 18:25.160
Yeah my mom just thinks,

18:25.195 --> 18:26.395
Being a security guard,

18:26.430 --> 18:28.411
is a good job, she doesn't

18:28.446 --> 18:30.357
really care if I stagnate.

18:30.392 --> 18:31.859
You know she paid for my training

18:31.894 --> 18:33.326
so she's like oh good a mediocre

18:33.361 --> 18:35.326
security guard's my son.

18:35.932 --> 18:39.265
But you know it led to me meeting Trey.

18:40.263 --> 18:42.047
You know what else?

18:42.082 --> 18:43.831
We gonna do it brah.

18:44.138 --> 18:45.638
- No doubt. - Well there's
something that Monica and I

18:50.302 --> 18:52.003
have been wanting to tell you

18:52.038 --> 18:53.705
and it has to do with this.

18:55.061 --> 18:56.726
I talked to my mom about you guys

18:56.761 --> 18:59.089
and I played her your shit.

18:59.124 --> 19:00.719
You know she's on the art council

19:00.754 --> 19:03.431
and she approves funds
for after school programs

19:03.466 --> 19:05.013
and we were talking about allocating

19:05.048 --> 19:08.557
some funds for music
education in the Oakland area.

19:08.592 --> 19:12.067
And then Monica's non-profit
organization got involved.

19:12.102 --> 19:14.067
And your names just came up.

19:15.115 --> 19:16.846
Yeah well your names were always there

19:16.881 --> 19:19.326
but we want you to be happy
and follow your dreams.

19:19.361 --> 19:22.183
So everything's just in place.

19:22.218 --> 19:25.857
You guys are gonna be
teaching under privileged kids

19:25.892 --> 19:29.497
how to rap and drop sick beats
full time, fuck security.

19:35.990 --> 19:37.466
27 bucks an hour.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.898
And you'll have full studio access.

19:39.933 --> 19:41.648
I love you so much.

19:47.910 --> 19:49.410
You're the best.

19:52.005 --> 19:55.422
We almost forgot your name tags.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.835
Makin' it official.

20:07.078 --> 20:09.328
d Trolling

20:11.690 --> 20:13.906
Yeah it's a original composition.

20:13.941 --> 20:15.322
Whatever you wanna call it.

20:15.357 --> 20:18.180
It's mine, it's mine I wrote it.

20:18.215 --> 20:21.019
Please we'd love to hear it.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.551
This how I been feelin.

d She drinks my jizz out a goblet

20:36.933 --> 20:37.978

20:38.013 --> 20:40.658
I ain't gonna lie I'm finna write that.

20:40.693 --> 20:42.888
Next time finish the rhyme yourself.

20:42.923 --> 20:45.083
You don't wanna deal with ghost writers.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.453
Leeching on your back.

20:47.488 --> 20:50.071
Your mind is a temple Jermaine.

20:51.695 --> 20:52.862
That's true.

20:55.856 --> 20:56.654
d I dress like duh

20:56.689 --> 20:59.352

21:34.765 --> 21:38.868
d Get this money on the low end

21:38.903 --> 21:40.868
Not so fast hooligans.

21:41.712 --> 21:44.503
We're shutting this program down.

21:44.538 --> 21:46.538
We have a court order.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.503
We're shuttin' you down.

21:48.538 --> 21:50.306
My name is Augustus Turnblatt.

21:50.341 --> 21:53.271
Council President of the 14th district.

21:53.306 --> 21:56.166
And I'm shutting this program down.

21:56.201 --> 22:00.118
Under section c47-3 of
the hate crimes statute.

22:02.382 --> 22:05.351
Promotion of anti white sentiment.

22:05.386 --> 22:09.553
We've been intercepting
your MP3 transmissions

22:09.931 --> 22:13.646
and every line of this so
called children's music

22:13.681 --> 22:16.563
contains slurs against white women.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.222
That part about my 17 year old daughter

22:20.257 --> 22:22.943
performing fellatio and being trafficked

22:22.978 --> 22:25.297
for your negro cocaine parties

22:25.332 --> 22:27.581
was particularly egregious.

22:27.616 --> 22:29.714
I'd offer you all a copy of the bible

22:29.749 --> 22:31.236
if I thought you could read it.

22:31.271 --> 22:34.361
But instead here's a little suggestion.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.194
Get a job.

22:36.526 --> 22:37.982
- These kids are just
expressing themselves

22:38.017 --> 22:39.101
you racist fuck.

22:39.136 --> 22:41.436
This isn't the 1960s you asshole.

22:41.471 --> 22:43.736
You better watch what you say.

22:43.771 --> 22:44.970
Trey!

22:45.005 --> 22:46.505
I can't breathe.

22:47.965 --> 22:49.514
Fuck you punk.

22:49.549 --> 22:51.299
Hey hey arrest him!

22:52.462 --> 22:53.922
Ain't like it's the first time.

22:53.957 --> 22:57.118
Actin' like I ain't been arrested before.

22:57.153 --> 23:00.244
This is your third offense Jermaine.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.549
Looks like you're going to
become a full time employee

23:03.584 --> 23:06.613
of the Alameda County prison system.

23:06.648 --> 23:08.171
Take him away!

23:08.206 --> 23:09.497
Shut your fat ass up!

23:09.532 --> 23:10.789
Let's go, let's go!

23:20.959 --> 23:22.704
- He just trampled over
those fucking kids.

23:22.739 --> 23:25.863
It might as well of been the
Watts riots with hoses man.

23:25.898 --> 23:27.580
It was fucked up.

23:27.615 --> 23:30.389
- Cultural warfare fuels the
internal narcissistic supply

23:30.424 --> 23:32.718
of all conservative politicians.

23:32.753 --> 23:34.801
I wouldn't take it personally gentlemen.

23:34.836 --> 23:37.466
But don't worry the
Nullman is down to help,

23:37.501 --> 23:38.806
I got you.

23:38.841 --> 23:40.111
Thank God.

23:41.589 --> 23:44.657
- Now let's see what dirt I
can dig up on our dear friend.

23:44.692 --> 23:46.324
Councilor Turnblatt.

23:50.205 --> 23:52.205
What the fuck is that?

23:54.929 --> 23:58.846
- What you can't handle
a little ironic racism?

23:59.777 --> 24:01.777
I'm not actually racist.

24:04.286 --> 24:07.211
I just pretend to be so I can assert

24:07.246 --> 24:11.413
my superiority over the people
who aren't intelligent enough

24:12.519 --> 24:15.064
to be in on the joke.

24:15.099 --> 24:18.416
This is why I only hang
out with other trolls.

24:18.451 --> 24:19.999
I'll be in my room.

24:23.137 --> 24:27.304
- I'm just still kind
of analyzing him myself.

24:27.682 --> 24:30.242
- Well I'm gonna take
three of his nugs of weed

24:30.277 --> 24:32.802
and I'm gonna go home
and fuck my girlfriend.

24:32.837 --> 24:34.469
I don't blame you.

24:38.506 --> 24:42.060
- Odyn do yourself a
favor and call Kendra.

24:42.095 --> 24:44.634
I texted her this morning.

24:44.669 --> 24:45.884
Whatever man.

24:55.430 --> 24:56.263
Whoops.

25:02.971 --> 25:05.945
He never calls if he's coming home late.

25:05.980 --> 25:08.919
If I text him and say my back hurts,

25:08.954 --> 25:11.419
he'll just say I'm sorry baby.

25:14.525 --> 25:18.520
I don't even expect him to
come home at this point.

25:18.555 --> 25:21.267
I don't know why you put up with it.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.531
I mean you're beautiful, sophisticated,

25:23.566 --> 25:25.760
and have more motivation and strength

25:25.795 --> 25:28.427
than anybody else at the office.

25:31.383 --> 25:35.550
- I told you already that's
not what this is Aaron.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.374
I know.

25:39.356 --> 25:40.523
And I'm sorry.

25:44.245 --> 25:47.070
You and I are very different Odyn.

25:47.105 --> 25:51.272
We come from different
backgrounds, different worlds.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.754
Your being was forged
in the blighted heart

25:53.789 --> 25:55.498
of the urban jungle.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.172
My dad was a realtor.

25:57.207 --> 26:01.374
- But I, I was born in the
suburbs but I was reborn here.

26:07.719 --> 26:09.924
Welcome to my world.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.115
Oh cool what do you usually do here?

26:12.150 --> 26:12.913
Do?

26:12.948 --> 26:14.050
What do I do?

26:14.085 --> 26:16.860
I can do anything I want.

26:16.895 --> 26:19.981
Can't you see this place is a paradise?

26:20.016 --> 26:23.068
It usually heats up around nine, 9:30.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.360
Surprise.

26:27.395 --> 26:29.153
I didn't know you were coming Richard.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.658
- Yeah I thought you said
this night was too political.

26:32.693 --> 26:34.075
Well excuse me.

26:34.989 --> 26:36.970
When I drink absinthe I just can't help

26:37.005 --> 26:40.016
but feel like all of you
are forging alliances

26:40.051 --> 26:43.027
against me so don't throw
that back in my face.

26:43.062 --> 26:44.630
How many times have I carpooled you guys

26:44.665 --> 26:47.423
to erotic fan fiction
night at The Booksmith huh?

26:47.458 --> 26:49.999
- Oh yeah tonight
they're doin' Doctor Who.

26:50.034 --> 26:54.034
- Great looks like Nullman
is on the hook again.

26:55.022 --> 26:56.501
Calm down Richard.

26:56.536 --> 27:00.093
Don't you fucking tell me to calm down.

27:00.128 --> 27:01.926
You don't belong here.

27:03.032 --> 27:04.227
Hi I'm Odyn.

27:10.631 --> 27:13.916
- Can you guys believe this
fucking sacrilege over here?

27:13.951 --> 27:17.226
- I think we're having a
very good time Richard.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.376
Oh yeah and another thing,

27:19.411 --> 27:21.457
I saw you on Facebook wearing

27:21.492 --> 27:25.275
my handcrafted Victorian
augmented reality helmet.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.121
You know what it's waiting for you

27:28.156 --> 27:31.573
whenever you pick up your God damn phone.

27:33.189 --> 27:34.806
Classic Nullman.

27:34.841 --> 27:36.862
When are you gonna grow up?

27:36.897 --> 27:38.274
Know what.

27:38.309 --> 27:39.616
Fuck you guys.

27:39.651 --> 27:43.734
I created this scene and
you guys are killing it.

27:44.693 --> 27:47.170
You're killing yourselves.

27:47.205 --> 27:49.646
And pretty soon poor old Richard Nullman

27:49.681 --> 27:53.344
isn't gonna be here to
sop up the blood alright.

27:53.379 --> 27:57.546
'Cause I'm about to embark
on my most epic troll ever.

27:59.388 --> 28:00.637
You wanna hear about it?

28:00.672 --> 28:01.473
Well too bad.

28:01.508 --> 28:04.012
You don't deserve to hear about it.

28:04.047 --> 28:07.441
Come on Odyn we're
leaving fuck these posers.

28:07.476 --> 28:09.621
It was nice to meet you all.

28:09.656 --> 28:11.732
Farewell gentle traveler.

28:11.767 --> 28:13.860
What the fuck was that back there?

28:13.895 --> 28:15.954
Forget about those posers Odyn.

28:15.989 --> 28:17.566
Got work to do.

28:17.601 --> 28:19.798
After all you're in The Grid Gang now.

28:19.833 --> 28:22.733
- I thought I was
already in The Grid Gang.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.230
Almost.

28:24.265 --> 28:27.402
You're only a probationary member.

28:27.437 --> 28:30.539
But tonight was a test and you passed.

28:30.574 --> 28:32.211
So what happens now?

28:32.246 --> 28:33.849
Now a challenge.

28:35.228 --> 28:37.443
Our good friend Councilor Turnblatt

28:37.478 --> 28:39.658
ruined your after school program.

28:39.693 --> 28:41.145
What next?

28:41.180 --> 28:44.399
Do we stick his bulbous
nose into cyber security?

28:44.434 --> 28:45.399
Turnblatt.

28:47.150 --> 28:48.250
Within a gang,

28:48.285 --> 28:50.599
is a final initiation.

28:50.634 --> 28:53.833
If you wanna run the grid,
you've got to beat the master.

28:53.868 --> 28:55.350
I understand.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.162
- The first one of us to
get Councilor Turnblatt

28:58.197 --> 29:00.563
to resign from his post using

29:00.598 --> 29:02.894
their mad trolling skills wins.

29:02.929 --> 29:07.096
The loser pays for our
matching Grid Gang tattoos.

29:07.685 --> 29:08.695
You know I don't know if I actually want

29:08.730 --> 29:10.276
anything visible, I'm
trying to get into acting

29:10.311 --> 29:11.158
at some point if-

29:11.193 --> 29:12.114
Are you with me?

29:12.149 --> 29:13.000
Grid Gang!

29:13.035 --> 29:16.050
- Okay hello, how are
you, good to see you.

29:28.456 --> 29:30.706
d Trolling

29:34.984 --> 29:39.151
- We as a nation must stand
up and take accountability.

29:39.739 --> 29:42.255
Far too many women are being impregnated

29:42.290 --> 29:45.174
by their landlords in a forced act

29:45.209 --> 29:48.023
and are unable to forge a union

29:48.058 --> 29:51.207
because of their liberated mind sets

29:51.242 --> 29:54.357
and their dreams of meeting Mr. Right.

29:54.392 --> 29:57.861
Therefore I have proposed a bill,

29:57.896 --> 30:01.331
legalizing rape and authorizing men

30:01.366 --> 30:03.803
to own women as property.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.854
Which is their God given right.

30:09.636 --> 30:11.886
LOL owned by The Grid Gang.

30:17.113 --> 30:18.401
Can't you see it's not me.

30:18.436 --> 30:19.388
It's them!

30:19.423 --> 30:21.295
It's the trolls!

30:21.330 --> 30:22.212
The trolls!

30:23.854 --> 30:25.243
Misogynist

30:35.527 --> 30:36.879
I can't let myself be upstaged

30:36.914 --> 30:40.031
by a pathetic little newfag like Odyn.

30:40.066 --> 30:44.233
I think it's time that I
pulled out all the stops.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.300
d Trolling

31:00.916 --> 31:02.152
Okay, okay come on, come on,

31:02.187 --> 31:03.983
you can walk.

31:04.018 --> 31:05.896
Come on you can feel 'em.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.283
I can feel 'em, you can feel 'em.

31:07.318 --> 31:08.450
Come on get up, get up.

31:08.485 --> 31:09.645
Come on man.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.279
Look he's gonna be okay.

31:11.314 --> 31:12.844
Look come on, come on.

31:12.879 --> 31:14.192
I'm callin' an ambulance.

31:14.227 --> 31:15.407
No you don't need to do that.

31:15.442 --> 31:16.655
Look, look, look, look, look.

31:16.690 --> 31:17.868
Everything's gonna be alright.

31:17.903 --> 31:18.666
Okay?

31:18.701 --> 31:21.661
Look a little fellow named
Andrew Jackson told me so.

31:21.696 --> 31:24.622
Here go get yourself some
malt liquor honey come on.

31:24.657 --> 31:25.420
Come on, come on.

31:25.455 --> 31:26.253
We're not gonna settle.

31:26.288 --> 31:28.188
No we, we are, we've already settled.

31:28.223 --> 31:30.499
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.053
Come on, come on get up.

31:32.088 --> 31:33.868
Don't need an ambulance.

31:33.903 --> 31:35.613
Councilor Turnblatt.

31:35.648 --> 31:37.154
What exactly is going on here?

31:37.189 --> 31:38.763
Nothing is going on.

31:38.798 --> 31:39.984
Don't worry about it.

31:40.019 --> 31:41.153
Everything is fine.

31:41.188 --> 31:42.582
Everything is alright.

31:42.617 --> 31:43.941
Just forget about it okay?

31:43.976 --> 31:45.780
No it's not gonna be alright.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.336
Yes!

32:05.003 --> 32:08.108
Yes you meet me at Jamba Juice correct?

32:08.143 --> 32:09.626
You buy me mango drink?

32:10.857 --> 32:13.190
Whatever you say Ling San.

32:19.369 --> 32:21.369
I'm horny where are you?

32:23.124 --> 32:24.536
Dammit where are you?

32:24.571 --> 32:26.359
Alright, alright Turnblatt.

32:26.394 --> 32:27.988
We got you this time.

32:30.906 --> 32:32.779
Read 'em and weep Nullman.

32:32.814 --> 32:33.612
I win.

32:34.498 --> 32:36.180
Yeah you're good.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.226
I guess.

32:48.883 --> 32:49.716
Ow.

32:50.699 --> 32:54.528
Hey make sure you use more
cross hatching on mine.

32:54.563 --> 32:56.945
That's not how you designed it bro.

32:56.980 --> 32:57.774
You know what?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.222
I don't think I like your tone madam.

33:00.257 --> 33:01.707
Come on Odyn let's go.

33:01.742 --> 33:05.159
This would be better as a stick and poke.

33:12.507 --> 33:14.954
That tattoo artist was a fucking poser.

33:14.989 --> 33:17.107
This should've been a
scarification anyway.

33:17.142 --> 33:17.940
Yeah.

33:25.015 --> 33:26.439
Hey you might wanna do that at home.

33:26.474 --> 33:27.697
You know when you're in front of a mirror.

33:27.732 --> 33:29.512
I mean just a suggestion.

33:29.547 --> 33:32.880
You make an excellent point my friend.

33:34.655 --> 33:36.027
You know Odyn,

33:36.062 --> 33:38.450
I think the two of us need
a little bit of time apart.

33:38.485 --> 33:40.628
I gotta go home and deal
with some life shit.

33:40.663 --> 33:42.448
You know what I mean?

33:42.483 --> 33:43.429
I think I do.

33:43.464 --> 33:45.826
But I want us to meet next weekend

33:45.861 --> 33:48.809
and we can begin our most top secret

33:48.844 --> 33:51.758
and epic troll ever are you with me?

33:51.793 --> 33:53.592
Grid Gang for life.

33:53.627 --> 33:54.509
Good boy.

34:23.463 --> 34:24.417
Stop.

34:24.452 --> 34:26.848
- Oh well if the vegan
whoopie pie is so sinful,

34:26.882 --> 34:30.145
no one shall have to intake its poison.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.576
You're embarrassing me.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.021
I mean I just spent $87 on groceries.

34:34.056 --> 34:35.434
I didn't even conceal it.

34:35.469 --> 34:37.431
So if someone was gonna say
sir you didn't pay for that,

34:37.466 --> 34:39.699
I'd be like oh sorry good sir.

34:39.735 --> 34:41.507
I was just thinking about jacking off

34:41.543 --> 34:44.405
and so let me pay you the money

34:44.440 --> 34:46.023
and nothing would happen.

34:46.058 --> 34:47.985
It's just sleazy.

34:48.021 --> 34:50.373
- I just don't understand
how that's wrong.

34:50.409 --> 34:53.130
There's a certain shrinkage
ratio in the marketplace

34:53.165 --> 34:55.851
of commodities and I actually
added profit to the store

34:55.887 --> 34:58.852
by purchasing a lot of groceries.

34:58.887 --> 35:01.783
So what is the thing I fucked up?

35:01.818 --> 35:03.840
Is Jesus gonna come down and punish me?

35:03.875 --> 35:05.863
Is there some objective moral imperative

35:05.898 --> 35:06.828
that I'm not aware of?

35:06.863 --> 35:08.482
I mean how is it wrong exactly?

35:08.517 --> 35:09.755
Can you explain that to me?

35:09.790 --> 35:10.959
If you're gonna do it,

35:10.994 --> 35:12.053
just don't do it around me.

35:12.088 --> 35:14.968
I don't wanna be a fuckin' part of it.

35:15.003 --> 35:16.911
Okay I mean that's fair.

35:16.946 --> 35:17.761
I understand.

35:17.796 --> 35:18.577
I respect that.

35:25.533 --> 35:26.661
I don't know if you remember

35:26.696 --> 35:27.755
but three and a half months ago,

35:27.790 --> 35:29.683
you thought it was funny
and we actually bonded

35:29.718 --> 35:31.577
from when you stole
maxi pads at Walgreens.

35:31.612 --> 35:32.968
So yeah.

35:33.003 --> 35:35.745
- Look I don't wanna be
a part of it anymore.

35:35.780 --> 35:38.978
Well I guess you can pay for your meal

35:39.013 --> 35:42.177
and you can tell them that I stole mine

35:42.212 --> 35:44.677
because I'm a terrible person.

35:49.072 --> 35:51.807
Nullman had no doubt been
spying on my computer.

35:51.842 --> 35:55.390
So I guess I gave him
what he wanted to see

35:56.918 --> 35:59.335
or why he initially chose me.

36:00.510 --> 36:03.223
While Kendra was at work I'd often

36:03.258 --> 36:05.937
make good use of her house key.

36:05.972 --> 36:08.481
As she did God knows what.

36:08.516 --> 36:11.359
I could never masturbate to porn.

36:11.394 --> 36:14.438
I got off from copy and
pasting the sketchiest ads

36:14.473 --> 36:17.288
on Craigslist and routing
the responses to my inbox.

36:17.323 --> 36:20.103
But when you steal a random
perverts aspiring sex worker

36:20.138 --> 36:23.235
applicants, you become that pervert

36:23.270 --> 36:26.332
but employment itself is perverted.

36:26.367 --> 36:27.748
I don't fucking care.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.880
Your rappers and people
in the music industry

36:57.915 --> 37:02.082
and executives and they all
sort of have a company party,

37:02.974 --> 37:06.142
I mean yeah you would have to,

37:06.177 --> 37:09.056
you'd just sorta be there
for whatever they need.

37:09.091 --> 37:11.299
You might have to suck a little dick,

37:11.334 --> 37:12.565
just hook up with some of them

37:12.600 --> 37:13.796
or just ride in their limo.

37:13.831 --> 37:14.957
A thot?

37:14.992 --> 37:16.083
Yeah.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.390
Yeah but I mean I'm not a thot.

37:22.648 --> 37:24.379
- I'm not like the
abolitionist of that concept

37:24.414 --> 37:26.110
that can free you from
that because your trapped

37:26.145 --> 37:29.142
in that eternally so you know,

37:29.177 --> 37:31.531
you know enjoy life in that shackle.

37:31.566 --> 37:33.115
So that's all I'm saying.

37:33.150 --> 37:36.782
- Shackles yeah I guess
they're kind of like shackles.

37:36.817 --> 37:40.414
- But you'll still be
monitored to a certain degree.

37:43.666 --> 37:45.833
There's a quota to fill.

37:49.007 --> 37:51.425
Yeah I can give oral sex on camera.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.621
- You want me to tell you
about the movie or not?

38:13.877 --> 38:16.700
- You're talking about
girls and Asperger's.

38:16.735 --> 38:18.045
Okay tell me about your film.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.134
You were telling me about-

38:19.169 --> 38:20.095
You're wasting my time.

38:20.130 --> 38:20.987
Where you grew up

38:21.022 --> 38:21.855
and you're just saying
this personal shit to me.

38:21.890 --> 38:25.765
Well you asked me.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.446
I'm just trying to talk to you.

38:28.691 --> 38:29.708
Okay go ahead.

38:29.743 --> 38:32.923
- Real conversation,
real characters, real sex

38:32.958 --> 38:35.973
and just allowing the
sexuality, psycho sexual part

38:36.008 --> 38:39.482
to be represented but
it is a narrative movie.

38:39.517 --> 38:40.747
But isn't that an underlining theme.

38:40.782 --> 38:44.949
The sexuality why is that
so much in the forefront?

38:45.089 --> 38:48.192
It's more just about the characters

38:48.227 --> 38:51.295
experiencing things in a real way.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.093
What your talkin' about,

38:52.128 --> 38:53.753
it's like a genre, it's trying

38:53.788 --> 38:55.378
to break down genre in a way.

38:56.456 --> 38:57.574
In a sense-

38:57.609 --> 38:58.407
Documentary, sci-fi,

38:58.442 --> 39:02.501
shamanistic sexual theme.

39:02.536 --> 39:03.363
Yeah.

39:13.432 --> 39:14.904
No kissing.

39:14.939 --> 39:16.455
Yeah so we'll submit the footage

39:16.490 --> 39:20.422
to the other producers and
hopefully you'll hear from us.

39:20.457 --> 39:21.255
Right.

39:35.696 --> 39:37.099
Kendra.

39:37.134 --> 39:38.998
I got you the meatless chicken.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.649
Come tell me more.

39:40.684 --> 39:43.906
This is an extremely pertinent issue

39:43.941 --> 39:47.051
that needs a lot of dissection.

39:47.086 --> 39:48.801
Can you feed me them?

39:58.266 --> 39:59.848
This is good.

39:59.883 --> 40:00.681
Yeah.

40:26.012 --> 40:27.762
This is a bad show.

40:28.732 --> 40:32.551
- Yeah it is but it's
tryin' to try new things.

40:32.586 --> 40:33.384
Oh yeah.

40:47.423 --> 40:49.090
Whose scarf is this?

40:50.437 --> 40:51.687
I don't know.

40:54.110 --> 40:56.309
I don't own any scarves.

40:56.344 --> 40:58.509
Pretty sure aware of that.

40:58.544 --> 40:59.342
Okay.

41:05.007 --> 41:06.522
- The whole building is
aware that we're coming

41:06.557 --> 41:08.070
and I think everything's gonna be good.

41:08.105 --> 41:09.485
Good, good, good, good.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.027
Because I had to laminate
these over the weekend

41:11.062 --> 41:13.505
and my friggin' back is killin' me.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.510
- Did you physically
laminate them yourself?

41:15.545 --> 41:18.343
Stop bustin' my balls alright?

41:18.378 --> 41:21.092
You two assholes are
lucky I brought you back.

41:21.127 --> 41:23.807
You know neither of you
were my first choice.

41:23.842 --> 41:26.663
I guess that would explain the pay cut.

41:26.698 --> 41:29.644
- Why don't you carpool
if you don't like it?

41:29.679 --> 41:31.154
Share a packed lunch.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.640
Be creative.

41:32.675 --> 41:34.765
I've got to go and get the old lady

41:34.800 --> 41:36.855
some tampons, try not to embarrass me.

41:36.890 --> 41:37.688
Okay?

41:39.720 --> 41:43.887
Damn things I have to put up
with these stupid assholes.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.869
- Okay good he's gone
let's go for a second.

41:46.904 --> 41:47.667
Are you trippin'?

41:47.702 --> 41:48.870
It's our first day back dog.

41:48.905 --> 41:49.870
I need this.

41:50.896 --> 41:51.851
Come on be a man.

41:51.886 --> 41:53.783
It'll only take a second.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.767
So I went in one of those texting apps

42:07.802 --> 42:10.283
that gives a fake number
to whoever you send it too

42:10.318 --> 42:12.436
and I hit up Kendra pretending

42:12.471 --> 42:16.638
I was a guy she met at a
bar a couple months ago.

42:16.914 --> 42:20.761
And guess who's at a
cafe right now I guess,

42:20.796 --> 42:22.863
happily down for whatever.

42:22.898 --> 42:23.661
Who?

42:23.696 --> 42:24.529
Kendra.

42:25.921 --> 42:28.021
Well I don't really blame her.

42:28.056 --> 42:30.122
You're leaving her dick deprived.

42:30.157 --> 42:32.289
It's the principle Trey.

42:33.131 --> 42:36.109
Fuck it I'm goin' there right now.

42:36.144 --> 42:37.942
Really are you sure?

42:39.027 --> 42:41.249
If I'm not back in five minutes.

42:41.284 --> 42:44.411
You can have my half of the album fund.

42:48.904 --> 42:50.507
You the guy from the Craigslist post?

42:50.542 --> 42:52.580
- Yeah definitely she's
the red head in there.

42:52.615 --> 42:53.468
You ready to do this?

42:53.503 --> 42:54.347
Definitely.

42:54.382 --> 42:56.382
Alright here's the 20.

42:58.881 --> 43:00.000
Oh hey Kendra.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.215
Oh hey Paul.

43:01.250 --> 43:02.056
Yeah.

43:02.091 --> 43:03.563
I guess it's been awhile.

43:03.598 --> 43:04.560
You were drunk.

43:05.621 --> 43:07.617
Yeah you look good.

43:07.652 --> 43:09.534
Wish I could say the same.

43:09.569 --> 43:10.931
What?

43:10.966 --> 43:12.659
Yeah you're skin's bad.

43:12.694 --> 43:14.732
You look kinda cracked out.

43:14.767 --> 43:16.770
Even a little jowly honestly.

43:18.238 --> 43:20.060
Have you had work done?

43:20.095 --> 43:22.349
Were you like fat and
lost weight or something?

43:22.384 --> 43:23.933
You got ugly somehow.

43:23.968 --> 43:25.482
Not totally comfortable.

43:27.177 --> 43:29.239
That's just what I'm trying to say.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.301
Wow he's doing great he's on script.

43:31.336 --> 43:32.247
Okay cool.

43:39.128 --> 43:39.961
Fuck.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.998
- Wait Kendra stop I need
to tell you something.

43:45.033 --> 43:46.011
What?

43:46.046 --> 43:47.742
We never actually met.

43:47.777 --> 43:50.077
I don't even know you this is all an act.

43:50.112 --> 43:52.824
There's these sociopathic
forces trying to take you down.

43:52.859 --> 43:53.686
I know this guy his name is-

44:10.626 --> 44:12.683
Sorry man break time's over.

44:12.718 --> 44:14.592
And I mean that in the larger sense.

44:14.627 --> 44:15.931
So get to the next level okay?

44:15.966 --> 44:17.476
That's what I'm sayin'.

44:17.511 --> 44:18.274
Like it a lot.

44:18.309 --> 44:21.265
- Okay let's even just start
by wearing our name tags.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.747
What are you robbin' banks now?

44:23.782 --> 44:24.644
It's complicated.

44:24.679 --> 44:27.053
I don't really wanna talk about it.

44:29.055 --> 44:30.587
Hey, hey, hey break it up!

44:30.622 --> 44:33.205
Hey asshole no, get the fuck.

44:37.699 --> 44:39.788
We can call you an ambulance I guess.

44:39.823 --> 44:41.471
No it's okay.

44:41.506 --> 44:43.480
Hey you guys interested?

44:43.515 --> 44:45.007
In what exactly?

44:45.042 --> 44:46.403
Bein' my pimp.

44:46.438 --> 44:47.764
No we have jobs.

44:47.799 --> 44:48.734
Alright.

44:48.769 --> 44:51.403
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

44:51.438 --> 44:54.037
You should come to our show though.

44:54.072 --> 44:55.489
That's cute you guys rap?

44:55.524 --> 44:56.872
Yeah this is actually gonna

44:56.907 --> 44:58.366
be the first show doing some material

44:58.401 --> 44:59.498
from our mix tape.

44:59.533 --> 45:00.856
We're the Trapaholics.

45:00.891 --> 45:02.179
Alright, alright.

45:09.083 --> 45:10.534
You're not Lil B.

45:10.569 --> 45:11.879
I'm his agent.

45:11.914 --> 45:13.303
Oh.

45:13.338 --> 45:15.921
Wanna smoke some weed?

45:17.411 --> 45:18.209
Cool.

45:18.244 --> 45:21.152
- You goin' to a Sick
Sad World next month.

45:21.187 --> 45:24.015
Yeah Yung Lean's gonna be there.

45:24.050 --> 45:26.809
Hopefully we can smoke with him.

45:26.844 --> 45:29.670
- I once saw Andy Milonakis
at Subway at three Am

45:29.705 --> 45:31.792
he was ordering an Italian BMT.

45:31.827 --> 45:33.879
He was surprisingly humble.

45:38.238 --> 45:40.958
So do you wanna chill again?

45:40.993 --> 45:43.643
Yeah sure.

45:43.678 --> 45:45.900
Lil B fired me though.

45:45.935 --> 45:48.087
Obviously.

45:48.122 --> 45:49.372
Alright then.

45:50.244 --> 45:52.494
Hit me up.

45:56.324 --> 46:00.491
- Well I guess I saw odyn as
this kind of invalid ghost

46:01.841 --> 46:03.247
of a person.

46:03.282 --> 46:06.949
He had this kind of
wounded femininity which

46:08.571 --> 46:10.884
I associate with weakness.

46:10.919 --> 46:13.198
Made me wanna dominate him.

46:19.596 --> 46:20.675
Hello?

46:20.710 --> 46:23.989
Hey Odyn this is a bit of a hectic time

46:24.024 --> 46:26.072
in the Nullman household.

46:29.617 --> 46:32.700
I'm going through a bit of a breakup.

46:34.227 --> 46:36.485
- You know what I paid for
your vaginal rejuvenation.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.450
Uh oh.

46:37.485 --> 46:38.741
I'm sorry man.

46:38.776 --> 46:39.963
No I'm fine.

46:39.998 --> 46:42.415
It's just Derek and Stephanie

46:43.908 --> 46:46.454
breaking up with each other so.

46:46.489 --> 46:47.526
Oh.

46:48.604 --> 46:52.437
- Yeah it's creating a
lot of boundary issues.

46:53.448 --> 46:55.761
Richard come out let me play with him.

46:55.796 --> 46:58.074
Yeah Richard come out but play with me.

47:00.122 --> 47:00.955
Yeah.

47:02.038 --> 47:04.051
They both wanna guilt fuck me

47:04.086 --> 47:05.491
and I don't know who to choose.

47:05.526 --> 47:06.897
Why don't you just masturbate

47:06.932 --> 47:08.631
on both of them.

47:08.666 --> 47:11.749
You know that's brilliant in a way.

47:12.591 --> 47:16.344
But I just need some
time to process all this.

47:16.379 --> 47:19.490
So I'll let you know how it goes okay.

47:19.525 --> 47:20.687
Okay bye.

47:21.604 --> 47:22.868
I told you man we 'bout to blow up.

47:22.903 --> 47:24.295
I'm talkin' viral marketing.

47:24.330 --> 47:25.877
What the fuck you mean marketing?

47:25.912 --> 47:27.424
We need that money for studio time.

47:27.459 --> 47:28.530
No man I got this.

47:28.565 --> 47:29.528
Check it.

47:29.563 --> 47:32.072
I've been on this dating
site making fake profiles

47:32.107 --> 47:34.582
of dudes just to see if
Kendra would cheat on me.

47:34.617 --> 47:35.457
Any bites?

47:35.492 --> 47:37.147
The jury's still out.

47:37.182 --> 47:39.349
But then I started making
fake profiles as a girl.

47:39.384 --> 47:41.262
Wait your fishing for dicks now?

47:41.297 --> 47:43.389
- I'm tryin' to open up
the doors of perception.

47:43.424 --> 47:45.392
What's life like on the other side?

47:45.427 --> 47:46.190
That's real.

47:46.225 --> 47:48.172
She could be a five, a seven.

47:48.207 --> 47:49.662
Even wheelchair bound.

47:49.697 --> 47:52.893
These profiles are getting
50 to 90 messages a day.

47:52.928 --> 47:54.391
Even more checking the page.

47:54.426 --> 47:55.911
Every fucking inane
thing I say to these guys

47:55.946 --> 47:58.085
they latch on to like it cures AIDS.

47:58.120 --> 47:59.616
Niggas is thirsty out there.

47:59.651 --> 48:00.887
And soon these sad little

48:00.922 --> 48:02.751
simps gonna be drinkin'

from our cup brah brah.

48:04.615 --> 48:05.419
Do tell?

48:05.454 --> 48:07.909
- Each mommy's profile has
a favorite band section.

48:07.944 --> 48:10.365
These imaginary mystery
dates are hypin' our shit

48:10.400 --> 48:13.132
24/7 for free.

48:13.167 --> 48:16.170

And the intimate energy is good for y'all

50:09.744 --> 50:11.337
so what'd you like about it?

50:11.372 --> 50:12.170
Nothing.

What do you want.

50:14.622 --> 50:15.797
- Women,
it's why we're here.

50:15.832 --> 50:16.647
That's weird.

50:16.682 --> 50:17.428

This is a fuckin' set up.

50:24.967 --> 50:26.609
Energy's a little negative here

50:26.644 --> 50:28.515
so I'm just tryin' to raise the vibe okay

50:28.550 --> 50:30.292
I'm tryin to elevate your minds.

50:30.327 --> 50:31.610
I'm tryin' to open it up.

50:31.645 --> 50:34.861
I'm tryin' to open y'all
to a new perspective.

50:34.896 --> 50:36.392
Trapaholics.

50:36.427 --> 50:37.559
Trapa.

50:37.594 --> 50:38.406
Trapa?

50:38.441 --> 50:39.239
Holics.

50:39.274 --> 50:40.107
Strapped and trappin'.

50:40.142 --> 50:40.957
Always.

50:40.992 --> 50:41.738
Trapa?

50:41.773 --> 50:42.571
Fuck you.

50:42.606 --> 50:43.565
That was whack.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.099
- Fuck you too 'cause
we don't give a fuck.

50:46.134 --> 50:50.301
We don't give a fuck
because we trolled your ass

50:50.323 --> 50:53.629
and yall already paid for this shit.

50:53.664 --> 50:55.304
d Trolling.

50:55.339 --> 50:56.338
There's no pussy.

50:56.373 --> 50:59.366
No one would wanna fuck
your wrinkled cocks.

50:59.401 --> 51:01.366
They don't want to fuck y'all

51:01.401 --> 51:02.995
but we wanna rap for y'all

51:03.030 --> 51:04.589
and y'all already paid.

51:04.624 --> 51:06.102
So might as well.

51:06.137 --> 51:07.054
Trappa.

51:10.031 --> 51:11.526
Put that down, put that down.

51:30.564 --> 51:31.481
Hey guys.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.349
Nadine we can't thank you enough.

51:46.384 --> 51:47.158
No problem.

51:47.193 --> 51:48.394
You saved our asses.

51:48.429 --> 51:49.611
You know what I got paid.

51:49.646 --> 51:51.183
Awesome.

51:51.218 --> 51:52.675
And you did it all by yourself right.

51:52.710 --> 51:53.473
Yeah.

51:53.508 --> 51:54.403
That's what's up.

51:54.438 --> 51:56.950
Yeah you guys want some of this cash?

51:56.985 --> 51:58.395
Or you wanna come work for me?

51:58.430 --> 52:01.126
- Nadine we honestly
can't thank you enough

52:01.161 --> 52:02.025
for everything you've done

52:02.060 --> 52:04.058
but you know it's just not for us.

52:04.093 --> 52:04.922
Kay.

52:04.957 --> 52:06.511
No problem you guys
want some of this coke?

52:06.546 --> 52:07.428
I'm down.

52:08.377 --> 52:09.294
Officers!

52:11.796 --> 52:14.680
Alright caught red handed assholes.

52:14.715 --> 52:16.545
On the floor before I start to
feel threatened for my life.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.807
Fuckin' pigs I can't wait 'til we tear

52:18.842 --> 52:20.396
down your corrupt fucking regime.

52:20.431 --> 52:21.194
d Trolling

52:21.229 --> 52:22.171
Black lives matter.

52:22.206 --> 52:23.602
- It's weird that, that
crazy black guy that killed

52:23.637 --> 52:26.367
the NY cops picked Asian
and Latino officers.

52:26.402 --> 52:28.017
Isn't that kind of missing the point?

52:28.052 --> 52:29.958
On the floor now.

52:29.993 --> 52:31.978
Put your weapon down hands off that woman.

52:32.013 --> 52:33.707
That's not even occurring.

52:33.742 --> 52:35.401
I'm gonna enjoy this.

52:37.267 --> 52:39.326
Officer I beg your leniency.

52:39.361 --> 52:41.889
These punks are of
professional interest to me.

52:41.924 --> 52:43.739
I'm a talent agent

52:43.774 --> 52:45.804
just let 'em go this once

52:45.839 --> 52:49.172
and I will make it worth your while man.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.274
I've always wanted to do commercials.

52:54.309 --> 52:55.430
To be quite honest,

52:55.465 --> 52:57.176
it's kind of brutal once you turn 30.

52:57.211 --> 52:58.026
What?

52:58.061 --> 53:01.356
Hold the phone hey I got some photos

53:01.391 --> 53:03.856
of pop star Ariana Grande man.

53:05.896 --> 53:10.063
Who knows what she'll do so
these photos won't get leaked.

53:10.660 --> 53:11.493
Oh boy.

53:12.885 --> 53:16.718
- Check this shit this
is what I'm sayin' man.

53:19.523 --> 53:21.654
Fellas, fellas, fellas.

53:21.689 --> 53:23.751
Thank you, thank you.

53:23.786 --> 53:25.348
No worries you guys are great man.

53:25.383 --> 53:29.117
But I was a little peeved
about the 18 year old punk girl

53:29.152 --> 53:31.433
from the internet dating site.

53:31.468 --> 53:35.635
Who's just a viral non-existing
marketing campaign man.

53:36.621 --> 53:40.208
The shit you said turned
me the fuck on man.

53:40.243 --> 53:41.907
It turned me on man.

53:41.942 --> 53:44.919
You should put that shit
in your fuckin' rhymes dog.

53:44.954 --> 53:47.270
You should put that shit in your rhyme.

53:47.305 --> 53:49.552
Were amenable our style's just a facade

53:49.587 --> 53:51.998
that could ride on the back
of any corporation no doubt.

53:52.033 --> 53:53.280
That's the flexibility

53:53.315 --> 53:54.761
and the marketing moxie

53:54.796 --> 53:56.173
that I'm talkin' about.

53:56.208 --> 53:59.534
We can rebrand you, shop you around.

53:59.569 --> 54:03.152
You two could be the
future of hip hop man.

54:04.317 --> 54:05.197
Yes.

54:05.232 --> 54:06.071
Okay.

54:06.106 --> 54:06.910
Yes.

54:08.154 --> 54:09.987
It's my trademark man.

54:13.664 --> 54:16.917
So we'll meet tomorrow
and talk all about it.

54:16.952 --> 54:17.750
Okay.

54:18.867 --> 54:21.828
Now If you gentlemen will excuse me,

54:21.863 --> 54:24.790
I got a $36 blow job with my name on it.

54:27.907 --> 54:30.240
Get the fuck away from me.

54:35.854 --> 54:37.937
Green tea for the worker bees.

54:37.972 --> 54:41.357
And now you're violating my boundaries.

54:44.503 --> 54:46.920
Relationships are hard Odyn.

54:46.955 --> 54:50.070
- Yeah man I mean when
it comes down to it,

54:50.105 --> 54:52.162
it's like we both think

54:52.197 --> 54:54.185
about them as pin cushions

54:54.220 --> 54:55.968
for our internal shit you know?

54:56.003 --> 54:56.766
This discussion's

54:56.801 --> 54:59.126
getting a little too florid

54:59.161 --> 55:00.209
for my taste.

55:01.046 --> 55:03.042
Let's keep our mind on the troll shall we?

55:03.077 --> 55:03.875
Kay.

55:12.943 --> 55:14.561
When these documents get published

55:14.596 --> 55:17.265
it's gonna take down the
whole fucking government.

55:17.300 --> 55:19.934
Zoning laws are a fucking
fallacy and the people

55:19.969 --> 55:21.527
are gonna know that.

55:21.562 --> 55:22.527
Soon enough.

55:24.286 --> 55:25.978
Turnblatt was Watergate.

55:26.013 --> 55:27.670
This is Iran contra.

55:28.901 --> 55:30.471
So that you mean no one's gonna

55:30.506 --> 55:32.741
know what happened and
then the government just

55:32.776 --> 55:33.678
gets away with it?

55:33.713 --> 55:35.401
Shut the fuck up man.

55:35.436 --> 55:37.576
Can't you see that this is huge?

55:37.611 --> 55:40.137
- So we just release
these documents tomorrow?

55:40.172 --> 55:41.709
Precisely Odyn.

55:41.744 --> 55:43.139
Precisely.

55:46.869 --> 55:49.655
Any other details to discuss?

55:49.690 --> 55:50.988
No not really.

55:53.417 --> 55:56.413
- I'll actually man the
keyboards in that case.

55:56.448 --> 55:57.848
Yeah be my guest.

55:57.883 --> 55:59.213
This girl I'm

55:59.248 --> 56:00.919
actually fucking her right now.

56:00.954 --> 56:03.092
She's pretty hot right?

56:03.127 --> 56:05.230
So you finally got her?

56:06.166 --> 56:09.660
Yeah, same girl that I was tryin'

56:09.695 --> 56:11.254
to pick up when I met you.

56:11.289 --> 56:14.206
Oh do I hear a thank you perhaps?

56:17.793 --> 56:18.900
What?

56:18.935 --> 56:22.554
- I mean you got her using
your Grid Gang skills.

56:22.589 --> 56:24.554
The skills I taught you.

56:26.468 --> 56:28.068
- You know the type of
trolling I used to get her,

56:28.103 --> 56:30.490
I've been doing since I was 18.

56:30.525 --> 56:32.842
You do all this high level shit

56:32.877 --> 56:35.960
but I basically have a sexual problem

56:37.140 --> 56:39.841
that's essentially how I meet women.

56:39.876 --> 56:42.874
But your philosophy on how social discord

56:42.909 --> 56:47.076
was an evolutionary tool
stopped me from feeling bad

56:47.176 --> 56:49.759
about what I was already doing.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.022
I ended up getting a lot more pussy

56:53.057 --> 56:55.205
when I thought about it as a prank

56:55.240 --> 56:56.122
As a troll.

56:56.961 --> 57:00.461
So yeah thank you for
removing my conscience.

57:02.392 --> 57:04.364
Of course Odyn.

57:04.399 --> 57:08.232
But I still don't feel
adequately compensated.

57:09.963 --> 57:10.796
What?

57:12.510 --> 57:14.010
Let me fuck her.

57:17.018 --> 57:19.859
Not how this works bro.

57:19.894 --> 57:21.338
Come on can't you just say

57:21.373 --> 57:24.290
that I also work for this Little D.

57:25.277 --> 57:26.110
Lil B.

57:27.946 --> 57:29.586
I like her I don't know if
she wants a relationship

57:29.621 --> 57:32.925
but I'm dating her I'm on that path.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.258
So as one guy to another guy

57:37.090 --> 57:38.646
with a lack of moral compass.

57:38.681 --> 57:42.848
You know you are my Grid
Gang brother in that fact.

57:43.686 --> 57:46.936
So in a relation to this girl fuck off.

57:50.827 --> 57:52.306
What man?

57:52.341 --> 57:54.738
You don't even know her.

57:54.773 --> 57:55.655
I know her.

57:56.564 --> 57:57.973
I know that she still sleeps

57:58.008 --> 58:01.510
with her childhood teddy bear every night.

58:01.545 --> 58:05.013
I know the address of
every man she's fucked

58:05.048 --> 58:06.930
for the last two years.

58:07.881 --> 58:10.308
I've been anonymously sending
her every single thing

58:10.343 --> 58:12.074
she favorited on her Etsy store

58:12.109 --> 58:14.074
for the last six months.

58:15.223 --> 58:17.169
You don't know her.

58:17.204 --> 58:20.666
I'm her fucking daddy you bitch.

58:20.701 --> 58:22.025
You're not a troll.

58:22.060 --> 58:25.129
You're just a dumb fucking ape.

58:25.164 --> 58:28.198
Yeah your negroid blood makes you good

58:28.233 --> 58:30.115
at scooping white sluts

58:31.694 --> 58:35.834
and yet you're still not
willing to share the fruits

58:35.869 --> 58:39.974
of your one meager talent
with the only genius on Earth

58:41.114 --> 58:43.114
that can make you whole?

58:45.059 --> 58:45.892
Typical.

58:46.911 --> 58:49.878
Yeah pretty much Richard.

58:49.913 --> 58:53.747
Maybe Grid Gang will be the
name of my new rap album.

58:53.782 --> 58:55.531
You can't do that.

59:23.056 --> 59:24.702
Odyn thinks this is over.

59:24.737 --> 59:26.679
But it's not over.

59:26.714 --> 59:30.391
That pathetic little newfag has no idea.

59:30.426 --> 59:31.224
No idea!

59:47.423 --> 59:48.756
See you later.

01:01:30.198 --> 01:01:31.380
Hey baby.

01:01:31.415 --> 01:01:33.131
Get the fuck away from me.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.812
What, why are you here?

01:01:34.847 --> 01:01:36.170
Not only are you a slimy asshole

01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:40.316
who invaded her space
online and physically,

01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:43.308
but you're fuckin' here now?

01:01:43.343 --> 01:01:47.284
Don't you know that lying
for sex is a form of rape.

01:01:47.319 --> 01:01:48.469
How's that make you feel?

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:49.886
What do you mean we're gonna

01:01:49.921 --> 01:01:51.268
see the 3D Godard movie right?

01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:53.309
You're busted asshole.

01:01:53.344 --> 01:01:54.811
Oh fuck.

01:01:54.846 --> 01:01:56.362
You can't just have a girl blow you

01:01:56.397 --> 01:01:57.878
and fuck you for a part in a fake movie

01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:59.817
and expect no consequences.

01:01:59.852 --> 01:02:02.616
We're gonna kill you, you rapey creeper.

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:04.134
The movie is in pre-production.

01:02:04.169 --> 01:02:06.970
- Yeah where are the story
boards you little bitch?

01:02:07.005 --> 01:02:09.445
- I'm more of a overhead
lighting charts guy

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.252
or maybe notate the space
above the lighting set up.

01:02:13.287 --> 01:02:14.444
Get him.

01:02:14.479 --> 01:02:15.720
Chauvinist pig!

01:02:15.755 --> 01:02:16.962
Fuckin' nigger!

01:02:22.887 --> 01:02:24.611
I am making the movie,

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:26.355
none of your performances were good enough

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.877
to warrant a call back.

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:29.467
All I see are a bunch of white people

01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:33.286
scared to have a half black
dick in your entitled cunts.

01:02:33.321 --> 01:02:37.070
A process which I might add
was entirely consensual.

01:02:37.105 --> 01:02:38.957
You fucking sociopath.

01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:40.162
You might be interested to know

01:02:40.197 --> 01:02:42.099
I just hacked into your bank account.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:44.670
I'm about to post all
your information online.

01:02:44.705 --> 01:02:46.240
I'm glad the Grid Gang had the balls

01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:47.649
to put you on blast.

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:48.968
Nullman!

01:02:49.003 --> 01:02:50.250
Is he even half black?

01:02:50.285 --> 01:02:52.336
He looks like this
Iranian guy from my gym.

01:02:52.371 --> 01:02:54.353
- Don't try to fucking
label a bi-racial person

01:02:54.388 --> 01:02:56.816
to the pre-determined labels
of your mental reference.

01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:58.308
Am I assigning a gender to you

01:02:58.343 --> 01:03:00.932
without first asking
which pronoun you prefer?

01:03:00.967 --> 01:03:01.847
You tell him Odyn.

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.413
Nadine.

01:03:03.448 --> 01:03:04.492
To me he looks more Punjabi.

01:03:04.527 --> 01:03:08.091
- No I'm half black and fully
deep in your bitch's cunt.

01:03:08.126 --> 01:03:09.926
I know what you're trying
to do with that label.

01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:13.178
East Asian people have the
smallest penises statistically.

01:03:13.213 --> 01:03:14.858
Hey I take offense at that.

01:03:14.893 --> 01:03:17.357
Well either show us your penis right now

01:03:17.392 --> 01:03:19.391
or go back to your systems admin job.

01:03:19.426 --> 01:03:21.356
You're gonna die alone asshole.

01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:23.250
- Hey I just took a sales
force developer class

01:03:23.285 --> 01:03:24.581
from Amfasoft.

01:03:24.616 --> 01:03:25.843
Any advice?

01:03:25.878 --> 01:03:27.091
Go kill yourself.

01:03:27.126 --> 01:03:31.293
- See me and him we even
have more of a repartee.

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:33.107
We don't subscribe to the curse

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:36.231
of your white privilege super structure.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.005
Let me clear the air.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.988
It's not about race you fuckin' child.

01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:42.416
You're just a waste of space.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.333
Yeah see.

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:47.493
Oh wow this great example

01:03:47.528 --> 01:03:50.237
of the black race
assaults a fellow minority

01:03:50.272 --> 01:03:52.765
to the amusement of a
gaggle of giggling crackers.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.770
How progressive.

01:03:53.805 --> 01:03:56.272
I guess this makes him
one of the good ones.

01:03:56.307 --> 01:03:58.721
- Me and Kendrick have a
very solid relationship.

01:03:58.756 --> 01:04:00.358
Something you'd know nothing about.

01:04:00.393 --> 01:04:01.960
But maybe I know about the blurred

01:04:01.995 --> 01:04:02.793
Almost white assimilation

01:04:02.828 --> 01:04:04.717
he wishes he had.

01:04:04.752 --> 01:04:07.542
I, having been accepted
on more ambiguous terms.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.755
He's in a starker.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.761
Higher contrast relation
with you alabaster devils.

01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:14.870
- Yeah I really wanna switch
places with you right now.

01:04:14.905 --> 01:04:17.945
Especially since I'm 'bout to
break your collarbone bitch.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.795
We have a garden

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:19.611
outside our condo.

01:04:19.646 --> 01:04:20.409
He's chill.

01:04:20.444 --> 01:04:22.277
He's a bike messenger.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:35.121
- Odyn I read that
shit I'm over it fuck off.

01:04:36.923 --> 01:04:41.090
- Oh hey how's
it going nice weather.

01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:42.835
You betrayed me.

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.429
Here's your shit.

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:45.989
Get the fuck out.

01:04:46.894 --> 01:04:47.727
And leave.

01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:50.491
She doesn't wanna talk to you Odyn.

01:04:50.526 --> 01:04:51.966
And I'm only gonna tell you this once.

01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:52.910
Fuck off!

01:04:52.945 --> 01:04:53.819
Oh yeah?

01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:05.929
You killed for me.

01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:18.545
I want this baby.

01:05:28.905 --> 01:05:29.738
Come in me.

01:05:37.868 --> 01:05:38.951
I love you.

01:05:51.288 --> 01:05:53.575
He gave me an antique teddy bear

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:55.863
and made me this apology scroll.

01:05:55.898 --> 01:05:57.663
Your father's read it.

01:05:57.698 --> 01:05:59.393
It's not very coherent.

01:05:59.428 --> 01:06:01.274
We just wanted you to be happy

01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:05.161
but frankly he wasn't a good fit for you.

01:06:05.196 --> 01:06:06.828
Kendra look at me.

01:06:09.603 --> 01:06:12.314
You need someone with similar values.

01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:13.823
Should he be white?

01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:18.025
- Oh pumpkin we're not tryin'
to curtail your preferences.

01:06:19.499 --> 01:06:22.305
I'm open minded he can be exotic.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.111
I mean why not try a Spaniard?

01:06:25.146 --> 01:06:26.967
Here's what I am saying.

01:06:27.002 --> 01:06:31.040
Next time make sure he
comes from a good family.

01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:32.768
He can be black.

01:06:32.803 --> 01:06:35.555
But he has to think like a winner.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:37.555
No cultural differences.

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.432
d Easy with that funny face

01:07:10.467 --> 01:07:11.492
d When I play it at your wake

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.325
d I will make money

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.158
d Make money

01:07:27.053 --> 01:07:30.258
- Alright, alright I
see where this is goin'.

01:07:30.293 --> 01:07:31.841
So you be trappin'.

01:07:32.722 --> 01:07:34.089
Wow, wow.

01:07:34.124 --> 01:07:36.959
So kinda used to sell coke but now

01:07:36.994 --> 01:07:39.186
you're kinda goin' for
that college demographic

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.574
type of audience.

01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:42.669
College girls specifically.

01:07:42.704 --> 01:07:45.703
- And 50 year old Viagra
addicts bump our shit heavy.

01:07:45.738 --> 01:07:47.548
It's working.

01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:48.739
- So I'm gonna tell you
something right now.

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:49.800
I got some developmental deals

01:07:49.835 --> 01:07:50.696
and this is serious.

01:07:50.731 --> 01:07:51.950
It's comin' from my heart.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:54.626
Trey I mean I got some developmental deals

01:07:54.661 --> 01:07:58.135
and some labels lookin'
for some people to develop.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:59.010
You know what I'm sayin' but I gotta tell

01:07:59.045 --> 01:08:01.284
you the truth about this.

01:08:01.319 --> 01:08:03.523
Gotta get rid of Odyn man.

01:08:03.558 --> 01:08:04.749
What?

01:08:04.784 --> 01:08:06.701
Clearly you have an attitude problem.

01:08:06.736 --> 01:08:08.952
His look is problematic.

01:08:08.987 --> 01:08:11.032
Racially confusing.

01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:12.115
I mean Drake,

01:08:13.884 --> 01:08:16.363
he's bumpin' that Mongoloid thing.

01:08:16.398 --> 01:08:17.848
You know what i'm sayin'?

01:08:17.883 --> 01:08:19.676
And that's his hook.

01:08:19.711 --> 01:08:21.435
It makes him so nappy

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.256
and that's why they buyin' his units.

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:26.587
That's why his units is
movin' outta here man.

01:08:26.622 --> 01:08:27.658
I think you might be interested

01:08:27.693 --> 01:08:31.526
to know that our man
Trey is partially Native.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:33.817
Oh.

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.026
I get it.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.212
He's Indian.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.221
Blackfoot.

01:08:39.256 --> 01:08:40.162
Thanks man.

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:41.018
Oh great yeah.

01:08:41.053 --> 01:08:44.027
So I guess you're okay with this Trey?

01:08:44.062 --> 01:08:47.002
I mean you could be a ghost writer.

01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:48.541
No man I got you covered.

01:08:48.576 --> 01:08:50.423
I got this gay guy down in Long Beach

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.746
works with Lorde on the DL man

01:08:52.781 --> 01:08:56.948
I got this G-Eazy clone from
the post Macklemore buzz.

01:08:57.098 --> 01:08:59.984
Man maybe I can put you two together

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.018
and see what happens.

01:09:02.053 --> 01:09:03.874
Yo what's good baby?

01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:05.661
23 up in the house man.

01:09:05.696 --> 01:09:07.849
I'm poppin' pour like
a jack in the box dude.

01:09:07.884 --> 01:09:08.875
You know what I'm sayin' man?

01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.626
Don't even have to comprehend
what we're talkin' about-

01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.841
He's got a beautiful bone structure.

01:09:13.877 --> 01:09:14.640
I just keep it goin' right,

01:09:14.675 --> 01:09:16.249
freshin' the flowin'
and you don't even know

01:09:16.283 --> 01:09:19.421
about it 'cause I do ballet
right mother fucker what's up?

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:21.295
I will destroy you all.

01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:23.134
You'll rue this day!

01:09:36.483 --> 01:09:37.412
Where the fuck is Richard?

01:09:37.447 --> 01:09:38.305
I don't know.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.278
I thought he was with you.

01:09:39.313 --> 01:09:41.916
- He's honestly
been pretty neglectful lately.

01:09:48.558 --> 01:09:50.402
- You know it's really
good to see you guys.

01:10:03.927 --> 01:10:06.387
d I wanna be your dog

01:10:06.422 --> 01:10:10.499

d Daddy treat me like a bitch

01:10:20.021 --> 01:10:23.319
d Treat me like a faggy

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.838
You're violating my boundaries!

01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:34.646
d I wanna be your dog

01:10:34.681 --> 01:10:36.859
d Put me in the sheets

01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:39.038

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:39.988
d Tie me up

01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:45.095
Please Odyn?

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:46.745
We can talk about this.

01:10:49.909 --> 01:10:51.826
Most epic troll ever.

01:11:20.673 --> 01:11:24.609
I'm writing to tell you
about a troll called Nullman.

01:11:24.644 --> 01:11:28.546
I believe him to be the most
dangerous man in America.

01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:16.214
- I'm running my trolling
operations from here

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.511
while the police have
me under surveillance.

01:12:18.546 --> 01:12:20.438
First rule of Grid Gang.

01:12:20.473 --> 01:12:22.021
Troll never sleeps.

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:26.457
The second rule of Grid Gang,

01:12:26.492 --> 01:12:27.874
Know who you are.

01:12:29.593 --> 01:12:31.686
The steampunk community quite frankly

01:12:31.721 --> 01:12:33.318
outlived its usefulness to me.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:35.592
That's why I've chosen to adopt

01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:37.832
this new superior fuck boy persona.

01:12:39.291 --> 01:12:41.927
I got that pyrex vision girl.

01:12:41.962 --> 01:12:43.094
That's real.

01:12:45.932 --> 01:12:48.418
- I'm sorry that you
were taken advantage of

01:12:48.453 --> 01:12:50.835
by that pathetic newfag Odyn.

01:12:51.692 --> 01:12:53.918
I taught him everything he knows.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:57.946
But still he insists on
using his skills for evil.

01:12:57.981 --> 01:13:00.068
That's why the Grid Gang works tirelessly

01:13:00.103 --> 01:13:02.532
to expose mother fuckers like him.

01:13:02.567 --> 01:13:04.223
24 hours a day.

01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:06.425
We need to wake people up.

01:13:08.965 --> 01:13:11.382
Oh and I actually know Lil B.

01:13:12.381 --> 01:13:13.464
In real life.

01:13:15.177 --> 01:13:17.393
I know you told me.

01:13:17.428 --> 01:13:19.984
And I faked Wayne Knight's death.

01:13:20.019 --> 01:13:22.540
Perhaps you saw it on the news?

01:13:22.575 --> 01:13:23.373
Okay.

01:13:25.259 --> 01:13:27.046
Get off me I just wanna talk

01:13:27.081 --> 01:13:28.786
about the music video.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.654
You know what this is.

01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:36.050
Not so fast Nullman.

01:13:36.085 --> 01:13:38.786
You think I wouldn't crush you?

01:13:38.821 --> 01:13:42.988
Your trolling has given me
a killer campaign stance.

01:13:44.193 --> 01:13:46.056
Turnblatt for Congress.

01:13:46.091 --> 01:13:47.686
Get used to it.

01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:49.642
You know it scum.

01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:51.760
You're gonna die in jail.

01:13:52.652 --> 01:13:53.675
Three to five.

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:56.293
And that's just if you have good behavior.

01:13:56.328 --> 01:14:00.495
- Trolling, electrical abuse,
noise complaints, the works.

01:14:02.044 --> 01:14:04.961
We've got you by the balls Nullman.

01:14:05.995 --> 01:14:07.115
Fuck this man.

01:14:44.627 --> 01:14:45.954
Yeah L. A. isn't as bad as I thought.

01:14:45.989 --> 01:14:47.035
I still can't drive

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:49.234
but if I stay in the
east side I don't have

01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:50.651
to take as many Ubers.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.353
I'll get my license pretty soon.

01:15:06.429 --> 01:15:08.137
Once you get everything going

01:15:08.172 --> 01:15:09.846
you can come see your daughter.

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:14.100
Yeah we'll get you down here girl.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.935
I mean honestly I'm not sure the point

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.181
of living in the bay area.

01:15:17.216 --> 01:15:20.482
I mean you could be in
Portland or something

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:23.749
and still have the same
cultural resources.

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:25.166
Not for my job.

01:15:26.342 --> 01:15:29.759
I don't think about you when he fucks me.

01:15:36.563 --> 01:15:38.061
You were saying baby?

01:15:38.096 --> 01:15:40.849
Just that I miss you and I love you

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:43.603
and I'm so glad that I married you.

01:15:43.638 --> 01:15:44.908
I'm in Hollywood now.

01:15:44.943 --> 01:15:47.256
Have to make that fake movie
I've been talking about.

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.173
It's the only way to clear my name.

01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:50.001
Kendra are you there?

01:16:53.546 --> 01:16:56.335
- What the fuck I just
got an anonymous text

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.537
telling me to go to the hospital.

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:03.739
- Some guy with a Florida area
code just sent me a dick pic.

01:17:04.182 --> 01:17:05.015
God.

01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:14.831
- You're
in the Grid Gang now.

01:19:44.194 --> 01:19:47.584
- I've heard that you two are
the best trolls in the county.

01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:51.520
I want you to make porn pop
up on my boss's computer.

01:19:51.555 --> 01:19:53.687
I take it you accept cash?

01:19:54.305 --> 01:20:00.242
