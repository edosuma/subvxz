00:23.224 --> 00:26.692
No, it can't be.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.395
I just saw her yesterday.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.430
She had a new boyfriend,

00:31.432 --> 00:36.135
and her parents just bought
a house that she loved.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.706
I don't understand
how this can be.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.610
Please...
Tell me it's not true.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.512
Tell me you're wrong.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.349
She was so young

00:50.351 --> 00:52.217
and vibrant.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.622
Say it's not true.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.657
Please!

00:58.659 --> 01:00.793
That was very, very good.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.528
Thank you, Becca.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.797
We'll be in touch
with your manager.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.598
Thank you very much.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.167
Have a great day.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.673
I'm home!

01:51.544 --> 01:52.678
Mom?

01:54.147 --> 01:56.115
Dad?

01:56.117 --> 01:59.251
I had a great audition
in case anyone was wondering.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.313
Hey, sleepyhead, wake up.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.381
Becca.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.350
Becca.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.421
- You're here!
- Yeah, it's nice to see you too.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.791
My break started early, so I figured
I'd surprise you and the parentals.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.226
Well, it worked.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.861
When I didn't hear
back from you, I didn't...

02:42.863 --> 02:45.831
I know, I'm sorry.
That's college.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.869
Is that all it is?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.741
Dee, I've been trying
to get in touch with you

02:55.743 --> 02:57.643
- for a while.
- Okay, don't be melodramatic.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.578
I know.
I've been busy.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.413
You're skipping college,
so you don't know.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.315
I'm here now.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.250
So can I get some love,
little sis'?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.887
Lady di and becks
together again.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.758
- I missed you.
- Me too.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.529
It's so great to have
you home, sweetie.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.665
Thanks, I know.
I'm so excited to be back.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.233
I feel like I haven't
seen in you forever.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.534
I really missed you guys.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.637
Sorry.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.408
Three favorite girls
in the whole wide world.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.376
- Oh.
- It's great that you got that job, sweetie.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.312
Uh, yeah, I mean,
it's an internship.

03:33.314 --> 03:37.216
- A paid internship.
- Yeah, at dad's firm.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.550
Hey, you're
indispensable to Seth.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.219
Yeah, he's, um, a great mentor.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.454
Well, anyway, what I want
to hear about is becks.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.689
How was your senior play?

03:43.691 --> 03:45.424
My blanche stole the show.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.625
- Hmm.
- -'Atta girl.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.529
I wish you were there.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.566
I know, I know.
I really wanted to be.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.368
No, it's okay.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.870
I figured you
wouldn't be, but...

03:58.872 --> 04:00.706
In a perfect world,

04:00.708 --> 04:02.474
I would've liked
to have you there.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.413
Oh, by the way,
Dave got me an audition

04:08.415 --> 04:10.315
- for an indie feature.
- Oh?

04:10.317 --> 04:12.484
- Wow, that's fantastic.
- Dave?

04:12.486 --> 04:13.919
Her manager.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.488
Yeah, it'll shoot
in six weeks...

04:16.490 --> 04:18.257
A real budget and everything.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.625
It's not one of
those cattle calls.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.394
It's... this one's major.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.663
That's fantastic.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.832
You're little sister
has some great natural talent.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.866
Aww.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.601
Thanks, guys.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.603
I'm gonna get
a head start, so...

04:31.605 --> 04:33.505
You all have a great day, okay?

04:33.507 --> 04:34.873
- I love you.
- Love you.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.275
- Okay, dad.
- -Love you all.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.477
Okay...

04:38.479 --> 04:40.545
I am full, actually.
Thank you, mom.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.780
This has been so great.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.784
Oh! Okay, um...

04:45.786 --> 04:48.053
It's great to have
you back for a bit.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.065
Dee?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.736
Dee!

05:04.738 --> 05:06.605
You scared me.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.374
You look flustered.
Are you okay?

05:09.376 --> 05:11.476
Um, no, everything's fine.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.878
Really.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.747
Obviously something's
up with you.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.749
I wish you'd just
tell me about it.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.485
Dee, I'm your sister.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.755
I have to go.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.691
Whatever it is,
just blow it off,

05:25.693 --> 05:27.426
and I'll blow my thing off.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.394
We can get fro-yo
like old times.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.398
You can talk about
whatever it is if you want,

05:33.400 --> 05:37.002
and if not...
Hey, fro-yo.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.605
You still think everything
can be fixed with fro-yo...

05:41.808 --> 05:43.075
And you're so right.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.913
I'm driving.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.848
And I'm the queen of england.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.454
Nice catch, your majesty.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.124
Becks, I...

05:59.126 --> 06:00.359
I've got to postpone.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.527
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.829
I... I wish I could.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.698
It's okay.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.500
I get it.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.672
No. You know what?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.140
I don't get it.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.743
I thought you chose
Cartwright over Stanford

06:17.745 --> 06:19.478
because it's
a half-hour from home.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.513
So why are you never here?

06:21.515 --> 06:24.783
Why are you ignoring
all of my texts and my calls?

06:24.785 --> 06:27.652
And why are you keeping
all these secrets from me?

06:27.654 --> 06:30.021
Dee...

06:30.023 --> 06:33.759
I feel like I've lost the most
important person in my life,

06:33.761 --> 06:37.462
and... I don't understand why.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.699
You're right, okay?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.000
About what?

06:43.603 --> 06:47.105
I did... I did
put distance between us,

06:47.107 --> 06:49.741
but it's for a good reason.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.176
Then tell me the reason.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.811
You can't just say that
and not tell me.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.113
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you,

06:55.115 --> 06:57.616
but you have to promise
not to tell anyone,

06:57.618 --> 07:00.185
especially mom and dad.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.420
Duh.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.659
What's wrong?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.895
Who is that?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.631
No one. It's just...
My boyfriend.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.467
- I have to go.
- Boyfriend?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.835
You have a boyfriend?

07:17.970 --> 07:20.172
For how long?

07:20.174 --> 07:23.475
- Dee, how long?
- It's like been a year, but...

07:24.444 --> 07:25.911
Don't bother.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.950
Becca, wait a minute.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.785
Wait.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.621
Here, this is Christian.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.023
He's cute...

07:38.025 --> 07:40.492
In a "fit to meet
the parents" sort of way.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.628
You could have told me.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.664
It's complicated.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.132
So explain it to me.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.673
I... have to go
take care of something,

07:54.675 --> 07:56.808
but we'll talk later.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.910
- Yeah?
- I got to go to work, so...

07:58.912 --> 08:00.512
Whatever.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.699
Thank you for calling
woods and Monroe.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.534
How can I assist you?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.537
Sure, I'll connect you.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.665
Becca, call me back
as soon as you get this.

08:53.667 --> 08:58.637
Oh, I screwed up... bad.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.739
I don't see a way out.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.747
Dee?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.283
I'm back!

09:14.287 --> 09:16.621
Mom? Dad?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.763
Dee?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.231
I'm coming in.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.738
Help!

09:33.740 --> 09:35.307
Help!

09:44.084 --> 09:46.184
- Where is she?
- Oh...

09:46.186 --> 09:47.752
I'm sorry,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.321
- but you can't touch her.
- -Let me go!

09:49.323 --> 09:51.256
My girl! Oh my god!

09:53.860 --> 09:56.161
My baby!

10:20.987 --> 10:24.356
Mr. Wilson, I'm sorry
for your loss.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.024
We're through here for tonight.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.759
Was it suicide?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.628
We're opening an investigation.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.030
That's a question
that many parents ask.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.832
What are the next steps,
detective?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.333
An autopsy.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.869
It's standard procedure
for any apparent suicide.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.138
Why? Why would she do that?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.107
Everybody loved her?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.742
Wait, the message.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.146
Becca, call me back
as soon as you get this.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.716
I screwed up...

10:51.718 --> 10:53.351
Bad and...

10:53.353 --> 10:55.654
I don't see a way out.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.690
See? She was scared
of something...

10:58.692 --> 11:00.058
Or someone.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.161
I need to make a copy
of that message please.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.797
Maybe you should talk
to her boyfriend.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.198
She had a boyfriend?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.034
She told me about him today.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.203
Said they've been dating
for about a year.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.205
I think they were
having problems.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.740
His name is Christian.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.910
- Christian.
- She got a text from him today

11:18.912 --> 11:20.745
and her whole attitude changed.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.748
She got all distant.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.186
And then I found her.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.287
Okay.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.991
Thank you.
Let's go.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.404
You awake?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.111
You have to get up.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.181
We have to go pretty soon.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.794
I know we haven't
been close lately.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.232
And part of that's on me...

12:15.234 --> 12:17.168
But none of that
matters right now.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.972
And we need to be there
for each other.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.743
So if there's anything
that you need...

12:26.378 --> 12:28.446
Whatever you're feeling...

12:30.049 --> 12:32.083
Just know that
I'm here for you, okay?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.093
It's okay.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.126
Dad?

13:49.528 --> 13:51.262
Have you seen Dee's locket?

13:51.465 --> 13:52.364
No.

13:52.365 --> 13:56.201
It's probably at the dorm
with the rest of her things.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.004
We'd better get going.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.843
Is that Dee's sweater?

14:06.979 --> 14:09.480
I want to be close
with her today?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.449
Is that okay?

14:57.496 --> 15:00.198
Here, this is Christian.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.943
Oh my god.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.582
"Dear diary"?

15:59.591 --> 16:02.393
I can't take this anymore,

16:02.395 --> 16:04.595
the blackmail, the lies,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.564
and now the guilt.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.133
I'll never be free
of what I've done.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.369
The judge won't stop
until I'm dead.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.443
How did I let this happen?

16:18.445 --> 16:20.611
I'm so stupid!

16:20.613 --> 16:23.214
Mom and dad
will never forgive me.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.217
I'll never be able to come up
with that much money.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.693
Another assignment
from the judge

16:35.695 --> 16:37.328
and I have to do it.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.564
Because taking all
my money wasn't enough,

16:39.566 --> 16:41.766
he wants more from me.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.102
I've never been so scared.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.240
What did you get
yourself into, sis?

17:20.739 --> 17:23.141
Look in the app called
"dear diary."

17:23.143 --> 17:25.675
My sister was blackmailed.

17:27.568 --> 17:28.647
It's all on there,

17:28.648 --> 17:31.616
and whoever did it
could have killed her.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.486
There's over 200 hours
of audio on here.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.654
How did you find this?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.256
Dee hid it in her closet.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.124
I was looking through her
things and I found it.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.392
Have you showed your parents?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.461
No, not yet.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.264
Okay. Thanks.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.432
We'll look into it.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.438
The simplest things
become impossible.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.073
The texts never stop.
I can't...

17:55.075 --> 17:57.308
Hi, honey, what are
you looking at?

17:58.310 --> 17:59.377
Nothing.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.380
Well, if it's nothing...

18:03.782 --> 18:05.650
Do you mind if I take a look?

18:07.686 --> 18:10.088
I spoke with
detective Diaz today.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.390
About?

18:12.392 --> 18:14.792
I found something
the cops needed to see.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.561
Well, then I want to see it too.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.601
The blackmail, the lies,
and now the guilt.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.337
I'll never be free
of what I've done.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.510
I can't believe
she kept it to herself.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.613
She could have told me.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.282
It's not your fault.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.618
You know that, right?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.787
She could have come
to us, her parents,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.323
but, obviously, she didn't
feel like she could do that.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.627
If it's not my fault,
then it's definitely not yours.

18:53.232 --> 18:56.334
I was so mad at Dee
the last time we talked.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.338
The last thing
I said to her was...

19:00.340 --> 19:01.839
"Whatever."

19:03.242 --> 19:05.610
She knew how much
you loved her, honey.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.151
Can we hear one more?

19:20.526 --> 19:23.528
I told Marisa about
my new... relationship.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.196
I knew she wouldn't approve.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.198
I can't believe you're
cheating on Christian.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.501
He's smart, hot,
and age appropriate.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.838
Yeah, Christian's sweet,
but he's a child.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.841
Uh, yeah, you're right.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.543
He doesn't have a wife.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.312
What do you want me to say?
You're talking about an affair.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.316
It's not like that.
Honest, I'm in love.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.619
Fine, if you really want this,
I'll support you.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.454
But end things
with Christian soon.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.656
- It's not fair to him.
- I know.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.458
I'm going to...
Right after his open Mike.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.961
- Diana!
- He's been preparing for...

19:56.963 --> 19:59.397
Weeks, and I'm already
gonna break his heart.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.766
I don't want to screw up
his big night too.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.636
I guess I can keep quiet
a few more weeks.

20:06.738 --> 20:07.772
Thank you.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.513
So did you listen
to the diary yet?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.715
- She was having...
- An affair, I know.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.418
Did you talk to the guy

20:20.420 --> 20:22.353
or to Dee's college
boyfriend Christian?

20:22.355 --> 20:23.688
Look, we're focusing

20:23.690 --> 20:25.623
on other investigative
angles right now.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.857
What does that mean?

20:26.859 --> 20:28.426
We found that there
was involvement

20:28.428 --> 20:29.694
with a Russian gang.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.329
This is more dangerous
than you think.

20:31.331 --> 20:31.329
What?

20:31.331 --> 20:34.966
This is a dangerous situation.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.902
Are you at least treating
this as a homicide?

20:37.904 --> 20:40.404
We found a secondary
break in her neck,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.373
but we're still determining
whether or not

20:42.375 --> 20:43.908
the injury was postmortem.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.476
Oh my god.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.580
So somebody did
stage her suicide...

20:50.616 --> 20:52.783
After they broke her neck first.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.920
Or her neck simply
broke in two places

20:55.922 --> 20:57.521
after she killed herself.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.957
Look, that's all
I'm going to tell you right now,

20:59.959 --> 21:03.294
and I'm trusting
that you will stay out of this.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.874
Diaz thinks there's
more involved here...

21:18.343 --> 21:20.311
That somebody
could have killed Dee

21:20.313 --> 21:22.046
and staged her suicide.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.483
They found a secondary
break in her neck.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.351
Oh my god!

21:27.353 --> 21:29.453
They think it involves
a Russian gang.

21:36.728 --> 21:40.331
Mom, I'm gonna go talk
to her boyfriend Christian.

21:40.333 --> 21:44.368
No! They'll recognize you
from Dee's social media.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.703
Mom, I'll go undercover.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.505
I won't be dressed as me.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.607
I've already lost one child.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.677
Okay. You're right.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.813
We don't know this guy.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.098
Oh, go ahead, take it.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.566
- It's yours.
- No please.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.437
You were great.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.872
Thank you.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.141
Yeah, your song really moved me.

22:57.143 --> 23:00.111
It was so...
Passionate and real.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.379
Christian.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.680
Kim.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.916
So, Kim, do you
go to Cartwright?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.885
No. Parker.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.622
Community college?

23:11.624 --> 23:13.891
I'm sorry. I didn't... mean
that to sound like, um...

23:13.893 --> 23:16.093
A condolence?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.995
No worries.
Someone has to go there.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.930
All right, you caught me.
I'm a jerk.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.032
It's all good.

23:22.202 --> 23:23.101
So, uh...

23:23.102 --> 23:26.103
What made you schlep
down here from Parker,

23:26.105 --> 23:27.905
if you don't...
You don't mind me asking?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.409
Uh...

23:31.411 --> 23:34.044
I'll tell you only if you...
Promise not to make fun of me.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.846
- Deal?
- Mm-hmm.

23:36.982 --> 23:39.016
I made plans with my ex...

23:39.018 --> 23:41.452
To come here...

23:42.187 --> 23:44.622
Before he was my ex, of course.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.090
He does these
open Mikes sometimes.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.727
Oh, so you're hoping
to run into him here.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.761
No.

23:53.465 --> 23:54.598
Not exactly.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.634
He wasn't who I thought he was.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.069
Did he cheat on you?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.740
I'm sorry for prying.
I shouldn't have.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.042
It's okay.
Talking helps.

24:07.479 --> 24:10.147
If it makes you
feel any better...

24:10.149 --> 24:12.189
I just got out of a pretty
bad relationship, myself.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.619
My girlfriend wasn't
who I thought she was either.

24:16.822 --> 24:17.955
Did she cheat?

24:20.660 --> 24:21.759
I'm sorry, Christian.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.461
Thanks.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.229
I'd really rather
not talk about it though.

24:25.231 --> 24:29.633
Okay. No more
doom and gloom.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.803
Just 'cause we're single, doesn't
mean we can't enjoy a little music.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.540
Sit with me for the second half.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.677
In return,
I'll be delightful arm candy

24:39.679 --> 24:41.612
and provide insightful

24:41.614 --> 24:43.614
yet biting criticism
of each performer.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.117
Okay.
I can't say no to that.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.729
You're gonna have to excuse
the mess in my room.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.564
It's a little...
Crazy right now.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.267
Or we could, you know,
hang out outside.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.935
There's some benches
if that would, you know,

25:04.937 --> 25:06.604
make you feel more comfortable.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.706
Yeah, that would be cool.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.040
Yeah?

25:14.079 --> 25:15.112
All right, go back.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.683
- Weak.
- Really?

25:19.685 --> 25:20.718
It's kind of... yeah.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.821
It's been a...

25:23.823 --> 25:25.122
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:25.124 --> 25:25.122
Who's this?

25:25.124 --> 25:29.059
Oh, uh, this is Kim.
I met her at the open Mike.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.228
Kim, these are my friends
and dorm-mates.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.796
Hey. Marisa.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.031
It's super nice to meet you.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.200
James.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.003
Hi.

25:39.005 --> 25:42.540
Kim, is it?

25:42.542 --> 25:43.974
Would you mind
giving James and I

25:43.976 --> 25:45.309
a minute alone with Christian?

25:45.311 --> 25:47.678
There's something
we need to discuss

25:47.680 --> 25:48.779
in private.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.615
Yeah... sure.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.251
Um... where's the bathroom?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.153
Oh, uh, down the hall,
to the right.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.855
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.161
Dude, what are you thinking?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.930
Thanks, dude,
that's really nice.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.099
What James is trying to say
in his usual neanderthal way

26:09.101 --> 26:11.335
is Dee died three days ago.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.871
Yeah, and I found out she was
leaving me four days ago.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.172
All right, what's your point?

26:15.174 --> 26:17.074
Look, I know you're
hurt and confused,

26:17.076 --> 26:19.710
but don't you think it's a little
too soon to be seeing someone?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.111
Especially someone so...

26:21.113 --> 26:22.746
"So"? So what?

26:22.748 --> 26:25.082
She looks like Dee.
It's freaking weird.

26:27.652 --> 26:30.354
Why are you telling him
how to grieve?

26:30.356 --> 26:32.690
He's the one who
just lost his girlfriend.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.292
Who made you the judge?

26:41.333 --> 26:43.233
I'm gonna go, Christian.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.869
Hopefully we'll do this
again sometime.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.304
It was super nice.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.006
Sorry I caused this.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.610
Kim!

26:53.345 --> 26:54.778
Dude...

28:04.449 --> 28:05.949
You okay?

28:05.951 --> 28:07.751
Yeah.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.354
What is it?

28:14.893 --> 28:17.161
What is that?
Who is that?

28:17.163 --> 28:21.165
I think it's probably just...
Christian's friend James.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.802
Dee talked about him
in her diary, remember?

28:24.804 --> 28:26.804
You went to see him?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.405
I think they're just
trying to scare me,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.107
so I don't get near them.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.809
It's working.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.344
But that means they're worried.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.780
They won't hurt us.

28:36.782 --> 28:37.981
We're too visible now.

28:37.983 --> 28:40.951
Yes, we are... hopefully.

28:41.986 --> 28:44.388
And it's going to stay that way.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.422
Okay?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.858
Okay, mom.

28:50.195 --> 28:52.362
Oh, honey.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.264
You look exhausted.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.034
Yeah.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.103
Why don't you just rest,

28:59.105 --> 29:01.972
and we'll look into
this James tomorrow...

29:01.974 --> 29:03.907
Maybe even
talk to Diaz about it.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.482
I, uh, asked Seth to stop by.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.917
There she is.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.754
Becca, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.523
Seth was your sister's
internship supervisor.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.092
Diana was a very
special young woman.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.228
She'll be missed.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.763
Your father's office
is putting together

29:25.765 --> 29:27.531
a scholarship in Diana's name.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.000
It'll go to a promising
intern every year.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.835
All we need from you are
some personal thoughts

29:31.837 --> 29:35.038
about your sister that we can
use for promotional materials.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.073
Definitely.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.142
Great.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.911
It's nice to finally meet you.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.633
I've heard a lot
about you from your father.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.217
Like I said,
Diana was an amazing woman.

29:48.987 --> 29:48.986
I'll get out of your hair now.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.156
I just wanted to have
this conversation in person.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.124
Keith thought it would be best.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.225
Thank you, Seth.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.795
We appreciate
this scholarship idea.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.077
And Dee would appreciate it too.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.036
Uh, well...
We should be off.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.573
- Be home late.
- Okay.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.441
Take care, both of you.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.082
Did you see his reaction to Dee?

30:20.185 --> 30:21.385
He's married.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.921
So was Dee's man.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.293
Mom, come with me
to meet this James guy.

30:29.295 --> 30:32.996
- Beck!
- I heard your conversation with Diaz.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.464
She's not on our side here.

30:35.934 --> 30:38.202
I just want to talk
to him, that's it,

30:38.204 --> 30:41.839
get our own
information... for Dee.

31:01.893 --> 31:05.028
- What can I get you?
- -Hey, man, I'll take a yogurt parfait.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.530
For here or to go?
That's five dollars.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.298
One of these cards
still has some credit.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
Find the right card...

31:10.302 --> 31:12.436
Take your time.
Spoons are over there.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.943
I'll take a coffee as well,
if I could. Thanks.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.044
Coming up.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.445
What?

31:58.182 --> 31:59.983
What is this?

31:59.985 --> 32:02.252
Did they all pay off the judge?

33:41.486 --> 33:43.487
Back so soon.

33:43.489 --> 33:43.487
Who's Shelly?

33:43.489 --> 33:46.656
A sweet girl
fighting for her life.

33:48.559 --> 33:50.327
Fine.
It was a car crash.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.130
That's terrible.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.033
She was touch-and-go for awhile,
but I heard she's out of critical.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.301
Thank god.

33:58.303 --> 33:59.503
Why do you care?

34:01.072 --> 34:02.272
Look me in the eye and tell me

34:02.274 --> 34:03.540
you're being straight
with Christian

34:03.542 --> 34:05.642
and you don't have
any other agenda.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.545
That's what I thought.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.447
Stay away from him!

34:11.449 --> 34:13.382
Don't make me destroy you.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.085
I don't need the hassle.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.295
Dr. becter, please.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.147
Paging Dr. stayman.
Dr. stayman, please.

35:30.695 --> 35:31.761
Shelly?

35:35.900 --> 35:37.901
Shelly.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.503
You don't know who I am,

35:39.505 --> 35:42.772
but I just had one question
about your accident.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.375
No accident.

35:47.278 --> 35:48.578
What do you mean?

35:51.382 --> 35:52.616
What do you mean "no accident"?!

35:52.618 --> 35:53.717
What happened to you?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.321
I was followed.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.617
9-1-1, what is
your emergency?

36:27.619 --> 36:28.885
There's been an accident,

36:28.887 --> 36:31.188
on the corner of third and lowe.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.756
Send an ambulance.

36:38.564 --> 36:39.729
I'm sorry.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.300
Diana?
Is that you?

36:48.507 --> 36:50.707
Okay, one last question?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.310
Who's the judge?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.990
Ah!

38:49.027 --> 38:50.727
Hi, honey.

38:50.729 --> 38:51.761
Hey, mom.

38:53.397 --> 38:54.831
Can I play you something?

39:01.038 --> 39:02.872
I can't take this anymore.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.341
The judge went
too far this time.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.776
I need help.
I've got to tell Seth.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.379
Why would Dee tell her
internship supervisor

39:09.381 --> 39:10.580
about the judge?

39:12.850 --> 39:13.883
Exactly.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.769
I'm just here to see my dad.

40:38.469 --> 40:39.769
Oh, Dee.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.205
Thanks for lunch, Keith.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.876
What are you doing here?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.711
I, um...

40:49.647 --> 40:51.147
I just wanted to see the place

40:51.149 --> 40:52.882
my sister spent so much time.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.752
I understand that you're
grieving, and I miss her too,

40:55.754 --> 40:57.587
but this is my private office.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.888
You can't be in here.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.623
I didn't think it was a big deal

41:00.625 --> 41:03.092
since you and my dad
are such close friends.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.695
A distinction
worthy of a lawyer.

41:05.697 --> 41:06.930
Your dad would be proud.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.599
He's back now.
We were at lunch.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.900
Okay, thanks.

41:13.103 --> 41:14.671
And sorry.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.739
I just...

41:16.741 --> 41:18.141
Really miss her.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.619
Maybe he's the one
who blackmailed Dee.

41:29.621 --> 41:32.255
He'd have a lot more to lose
than she did if this got out.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.624
I think we should confront him.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.260
If you're right
and she was seeing Seth,

41:37.262 --> 41:40.196
that would be a huge
breach of trust on his part.

41:41.198 --> 41:42.866
Maybe even grounds for firing.

41:44.068 --> 41:46.836
But that doesn't
make him a blackmailer...

41:46.838 --> 41:48.838
Or a killer.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.673
I don't know.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.177
I don't know either.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.982
But even if there's
just a connection...

41:59.984 --> 42:01.718
And we miss it...

42:03.521 --> 42:06.222
Honey, don't you have
an audition tomorrow morning?

42:07.224 --> 42:09.292
Oh my god.
I totally forgot.

42:10.227 --> 42:11.728
Why don't you go and rehearse?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.663
I know how important
that is to you.

42:22.306 --> 42:24.040
Becca, we're ready for you.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.806
Oh!

43:04.615 --> 43:05.848
Oh my god.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.052
Becca Wilson.

43:49.226 --> 43:50.960
Becca, we're ready for you.

43:54.732 --> 43:56.633
Thanks for coming in, Becca.

44:18.255 --> 44:19.656
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

44:19.658 --> 44:21.324
Are you all right?

44:21.326 --> 44:23.026
Yeah.

44:23.028 --> 44:25.361
What are you doing here?

44:25.363 --> 44:27.430
I came here to ask you
why you broke into my room.

44:28.265 --> 44:29.432
You followed me here?!

44:29.434 --> 44:31.367
I did... Becca.

44:32.803 --> 44:34.137
How do you know my real name?

44:34.139 --> 44:35.905
Dee's Facebook, genius.

44:35.907 --> 44:38.274
So why'd you break into my room?

44:38.276 --> 44:39.776
And what do you know
about the judge?

44:39.778 --> 44:41.844
Just what I learned
from Dee's diary.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.347
The judge is a monster
and he killed her.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.448
Killed?

44:45.450 --> 44:47.150
No, no, no, no.
She committed suicide.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.384
Dee wouldn't do that.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.386
I found your stash of money.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.088
Stop pretending!
I know what I saw

44:52.090 --> 44:53.322
- in your room!
- You don't know squat!

44:53.324 --> 44:55.124
That envelope was
my payment to the judge.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.993
I'm being blackmailed,
same as your sister.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.429
What does the judge have on you?

44:59.431 --> 45:00.830
What does he have on Dee?

45:04.702 --> 45:07.070
This diary, have you
given it to the cops yet?

45:08.972 --> 45:11.040
You really need to work
on your trust issues.

45:12.342 --> 45:13.876
I could help you.

45:14.812 --> 45:15.878
What do you mean?

45:15.880 --> 45:18.214
I could help you find the judge.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.882
I've been a victim for months.
I'm sick of it,

45:19.884 --> 45:22.418
but you and me together,
we could stop him.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.191
How can I convince
you to trust me?

45:30.027 --> 45:31.828
You're not gaining my trust.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.796
You're making me uncomfortable.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.841
There.
Now you have my number.

45:53.517 --> 45:55.184
What happened?

45:55.186 --> 45:56.786
Nothing.

45:56.788 --> 45:56.786
Wait a minute.

45:56.788 --> 46:01.090
I slipped and fell
leaving the audition.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.925
Just upset 'cause I tanked it.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.193
I'm sorry, Becca.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.461
You never know, though.

46:05.463 --> 46:06.996
I bet you did great.

46:08.031 --> 46:09.065
Thanks, dad.

46:14.037 --> 46:16.305
We're here to honor
an exceptional young woman

46:16.307 --> 46:18.508
who touched all our lives.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.543
Not only was Diana
the most gifted intern

46:20.545 --> 46:23.079
I ever had, but she was
truly a good person,

46:23.081 --> 46:24.981
who cared about helping people.

46:26.150 --> 46:27.984
Whether it was dealing
with someone at the firm,

46:27.986 --> 46:30.219
or a friend, or a
stranger on the street...

46:31.321 --> 46:33.289
Diana had an empathy
that wouldn't quit.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.126
Will the Wilsons
please come forward?

46:38.996 --> 46:41.130
Keith, Michelle, Becca,

46:41.132 --> 46:43.866
Diana will be missed...

46:44.802 --> 46:45.968
But not forgotten.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.437
Every year Simmons & young

46:48.439 --> 46:50.406
will award a $5,000 scholarship

46:50.408 --> 46:52.842
in her name
to a promising intern.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.178
Thank you, Seth.

46:58.382 --> 47:00.149
And thank you all
for being here.

47:04.521 --> 47:06.956
Thank you, everyone.
Please enjoy some coffee,

47:06.958 --> 47:08.191
some snacks.

47:08.193 --> 47:09.392
Thank you.

47:09.394 --> 47:10.593
I'll be right back.

47:10.595 --> 47:11.928
Okay, honey.

47:18.836 --> 47:19.902
What are you doing here?

47:20.971 --> 47:22.939
I intern here too.

47:22.941 --> 47:25.174
My friend Diana got me the gig.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.877
I guess I know why you're here,

47:27.879 --> 47:29.946
Kim, Becca...

47:29.948 --> 47:31.480
Whoever.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.250
You're her sister.

47:36.486 --> 47:38.526
I won't pretend to know
what you're going through...

47:40.090 --> 47:42.525
But stay away from my friends.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.171
I'll be right back.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.491
Do you know where I found this?

48:16.927 --> 48:20.263
Yeah... you do.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.597
Do you sleep
with all your interns

48:21.599 --> 48:24.000
or just the daughters
of your colleagues?

48:24.002 --> 48:25.401
Did my dad know?

48:26.403 --> 48:29.505
No. He would have killed me.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.242
I loved her, you know.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.978
I was going to leave my wife.

48:37.247 --> 48:38.614
Please...
Please don't tell anyone.

48:38.616 --> 48:40.616
I already lost Diana. I...

48:40.618 --> 48:43.185
I don't want
to lose everything else.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.420
Besides, the truth
would only drag

48:44.422 --> 48:46.222
her name through the mud
and hurt your father.

48:48.525 --> 48:50.059
Are you the judge?

48:51.094 --> 48:52.161
I'm a lawyer.

48:53.163 --> 48:54.997
Not a judge, the judge.

48:56.233 --> 48:59.235
Dee was blackmailed
with a video of you two

48:59.237 --> 49:01.370
doing things that
I will never forget.

49:01.372 --> 49:04.073
And you certainly had access
to make that video.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.508
I make... I earn
900 grand a year.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.310
I don't need
to extort teenagers.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.478
Maybe.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.448
But you're the reason she was
blackmailed and got in too deep.

49:14.418 --> 49:17.286
You were supposed
to mentor her...

49:17.288 --> 49:19.422
Not sleep with her
and get her killed!

49:22.693 --> 49:25.328
I hope you think
about her death every day

49:25.330 --> 49:26.729
for the rest of your life.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.445
We found entries
in Diana's diary

49:42.447 --> 49:44.447
showing she
functioned as a courier

49:44.449 --> 49:47.583
between the judge and known
members of a local gang: Drakony.

49:47.585 --> 49:49.752
They're Russian.
It means "dragons."

49:49.754 --> 49:53.255
Drakony specialize in
confidence scams and extortion.

49:53.257 --> 49:56.092
But this blackmail scheme
is pretty new.

49:56.094 --> 49:58.194
This is the third instance.

49:58.196 --> 50:01.163
I mean, they had a guy down
at the cedar club on Wilshire

50:01.165 --> 50:03.165
gathering dirt and
blackmailing society types

50:03.167 --> 50:05.568
under the pseudonym
"the speaker."

50:05.570 --> 50:08.537
And there was someone
at the lewison building,

50:08.539 --> 50:10.706
the commercial district,
extorting white-collars

50:10.708 --> 50:13.576
under the name "Mr. president."
And now the judge.

50:13.578 --> 50:17.546
What matters is that
drakony is dangerous.

50:17.548 --> 50:19.515
In both previous instances...

50:20.450 --> 50:22.251
Deaths were involved.

50:22.253 --> 50:23.619
So what does that mean?

50:24.755 --> 50:26.489
The final
autopsy results are in.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.658
Becca was right.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.394
Diana was murdered.

50:31.396 --> 50:33.796
That suicide was
apparently staged.

50:33.798 --> 50:36.198
Forensics say
that the fatal fracture

50:36.200 --> 50:38.701
was severe trauma
to the cervical chord.

50:38.703 --> 50:42.371
That couldn't have been caused
by a fall from a ceiling fan,

50:42.373 --> 50:44.373
which means that
the second break

50:44.375 --> 50:45.641
was postmortem.

50:46.576 --> 50:49.111
And the judge?
He's the killer?

50:49.113 --> 50:51.647
Interesting pronoun choice.

50:53.083 --> 50:55.818
We're working on a theory...

50:55.820 --> 50:58.387
That the judge might
not be actual drakony...

50:59.356 --> 51:01.323
Just working with them...

51:01.325 --> 51:03.459
And that she may be
someone close to Diana.

51:04.394 --> 51:05.428
She?

51:05.430 --> 51:07.630
Where were you
Tuesday afternoon?

51:07.632 --> 51:09.398
3:15 to be precise.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.300
Becca don't say anything.

51:11.302 --> 51:11.300
What is this, detective?

51:11.302 --> 51:16.639
Shelly noonan is dead after
a visit from your daughter.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.274
- Who is Shelly?
- I was just talking to her!

51:18.276 --> 51:21.077
Be quiet, all right.
They'll use anything you say.

51:21.079 --> 51:22.711
She's not talking to you
until she gets an attorney.

51:22.713 --> 51:24.847
Shelly noonan is another
victim of the judge,

51:24.849 --> 51:27.716
injected with a fast-acting
toxin on Tuesday.

51:27.718 --> 51:30.119
- What is that?!
- The murder weapon.

51:30.121 --> 51:32.121
I ran the prints.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.356
I was surprised as anyone

51:34.358 --> 51:36.192
when they came back
matching Becca.

51:36.194 --> 51:38.260
How did you get Becca's
prints for comparison?

51:38.262 --> 51:39.395
She's not in the system.

51:39.397 --> 51:42.298
Becca brought this in herself.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.800
- There's more to this story...
- Becca, please, don't say anything.

51:44.802 --> 51:48.337
Unless she found out you were
the judge, confronted you.

51:48.339 --> 51:51.273
I mean, maybe you fought,
maybe it was an accident.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.675
This is outrageous!

51:52.677 --> 51:53.876
Listen.

51:54.878 --> 51:57.279
We look at all the evidence,

51:57.281 --> 52:00.483
not just the clues
that lead to easy suspects.

52:00.485 --> 52:03.786
Now, can you explain the prints?

52:03.788 --> 52:05.387
Becca won't make a statement

52:05.389 --> 52:07.656
until she consults
with a criminal attorney.

52:07.658 --> 52:11.193
Fine, lawyer up.

52:11.195 --> 52:13.762
Come and give me
a statement tomorrow...

52:13.764 --> 52:16.732
But don't leave town
because you're a suspect

52:16.734 --> 52:18.267
in a murder investigation.

52:25.575 --> 52:27.276
Becca...

52:27.278 --> 52:29.411
You have to tell
your father everything,

52:29.413 --> 52:31.780
everything that you told me.

52:37.187 --> 52:38.854
Becca, you heard the detective.

52:38.856 --> 52:40.389
You'll stay out
of it now, right?

52:40.391 --> 52:42.791
Yeah, dad.
I'll stay out of it.

52:44.694 --> 52:45.861
I know you're right.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.885
Thanks for giving
my name to the cops.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.487
I love cavity searches.

53:12.455 --> 53:13.656
I thought you're a victim.

53:13.658 --> 53:14.857
Don't you want justice?

53:15.792 --> 53:15.791
I'm no choir boy.

53:15.793 --> 53:19.261
How do you think I got
blackmailed in the first place?

53:19.263 --> 53:20.930
This isn't about blackmail.

53:20.932 --> 53:22.531
My sister was murdered,

53:22.533 --> 53:24.300
and the cops
have the wrong suspect.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.335
Who?

53:26.337 --> 53:27.937
I don't trust you yet,

53:27.939 --> 53:31.907
not till you tell me
what the judge has on you.

53:31.909 --> 53:34.543
Fine, I may have
spent the last year

53:34.545 --> 53:36.912
acquiring and distributing
test answers and amphetamines

53:36.914 --> 53:39.381
for a price, obviously.

53:39.383 --> 53:41.750
Aww, daddy doesn't
give you an allowance?

53:42.752 --> 53:44.353
Not one that suits my needs.

53:46.489 --> 53:48.791
Look, I was
gonna quit, honest...

53:48.793 --> 53:48.791
But then the judge found me,

53:48.793 --> 53:51.994
and I had to keep selling 'em
to pay him off.

53:54.598 --> 53:56.699
Dee was my friend too.

53:56.701 --> 53:57.900
If I'd have known
she was targeted,

53:57.902 --> 53:59.235
I'd have helped her.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.470
Say I believe you.

54:02.472 --> 54:03.639
Then what?

54:03.641 --> 54:05.374
Then we work together
to find the judge.

54:06.776 --> 54:08.544
So if the cops
had the wrong suspect,

54:08.546 --> 54:09.578
who's the right suspect?

54:09.580 --> 54:11.347
Who had access to Dee's web cam?

54:12.282 --> 54:13.816
Just Christian and Marisa,

54:13.818 --> 54:15.517
but who knows for sure.

54:16.453 --> 54:17.853
My money's on Christian.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.422
He learned Dee was dumping him
the day before she died.

54:20.424 --> 54:21.857
He's been a train wreck since,

54:21.859 --> 54:24.593
and he's taking it out
on my ears.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.495
One second, a revenge song.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.831
The next second,
a dopey love song.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.332
Then we start there.

54:31.401 --> 54:33.969
He said he wasn't
the revenge type.

54:33.971 --> 54:36.505
You weren't the only one
who trailed me to my audition.

54:36.507 --> 54:38.340
The judge was there too.

54:51.721 --> 54:53.355
For you, mademoiselle.

54:53.357 --> 54:54.390
Aww.

54:55.325 --> 54:56.625
Merci, monsieur.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.302
I love the taste of coffee,

55:06.304 --> 55:09.038
but it's so strong for me.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.708
This way... it gets
filtered through a layer

55:12.710 --> 55:13.976
of sugary goodness.

55:14.944 --> 55:16.779
Wow, okay.

55:16.781 --> 55:19.048
Yeah, I know people like
coffee with their sugar, but...

55:20.016 --> 55:22.551
You really mean it, huh?

55:22.553 --> 55:24.320
You know, I'm really glad
you called me back.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.822
I wasn't sure you were going to.

55:28.525 --> 55:29.625
Me too.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.595
I'm sorry.

55:33.597 --> 55:35.364
After that encounter
with your friends,

55:35.366 --> 55:37.733
I just... needed a few days.

55:39.969 --> 55:41.637
How are things with them?

55:43.373 --> 55:44.573
They're trying.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.442
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

55:46.444 --> 55:47.876
I mean, we all are,
I guess, but...

55:47.878 --> 55:49.345
It's been pretty hard, lately,

55:49.347 --> 55:50.412
especially after what happened.

55:50.414 --> 55:51.814
Hmm.

55:51.816 --> 55:54.016
Literally, the only time
I've actually cracked a smile

55:54.018 --> 55:57.086
in the past few weeks
is... when I'm with you.

55:57.088 --> 55:58.354
Really?

55:58.356 --> 55:59.722
Yeah.

55:59.724 --> 56:00.989
That's really sweet.

56:00.991 --> 56:02.424
I mean it.

56:05.462 --> 56:07.129
- It's good.
- Right?

56:07.131 --> 56:07.129
It's good, I like it.

56:07.131 --> 56:10.833
That's from their
underground album.

56:10.835 --> 56:12.401
I want to listen too.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.372
Hang in there.

56:16.374 --> 56:17.773
You'll be happy again.

56:26.683 --> 56:28.517
I'm sorry.

56:28.519 --> 56:30.919
It's just... too soon...

56:31.855 --> 56:33.088
For both of us.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.490
You're right...

56:35.492 --> 56:36.592
But I like you, Kim.

56:38.895 --> 56:40.496
You don't have
to say anything, okay?

56:40.498 --> 56:41.663
I can wait.

56:45.769 --> 56:47.736
I told you to stay
away from him!

56:48.671 --> 56:50.873
You're screwing with his head.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.107
I don't care if you're grieving.

56:52.109 --> 56:53.542
You're an awful person.

56:53.544 --> 56:55.744
The only reason
I haven't told him the truth

56:55.746 --> 56:57.513
is to spare him
from another betrayal,

56:57.515 --> 56:59.415
but if I see you again...

57:00.150 --> 57:01.550
I tell everything.

57:13.129 --> 57:15.431
I don't think
Christian's the judge.

57:15.433 --> 57:17.199
Christian is the judge.

57:17.201 --> 57:18.467
What?

57:18.469 --> 57:19.701
I texted you, look.

57:26.643 --> 57:29.077
I took a photo of his GPS log.

57:29.079 --> 57:31.580
Right there, see?

57:31.582 --> 57:33.816
He was near the casting office
during my audition.

57:35.051 --> 57:36.685
Oh my god!

58:33.276 --> 58:35.010
Mom? Dad?

58:53.930 --> 58:54.963
Hey!

59:01.237 --> 59:02.271
Oh! Ah!

59:12.148 --> 59:14.249
Becca! Are you here?

59:15.318 --> 59:16.552
Hey!

59:18.088 --> 59:19.655
Go after him!

59:19.657 --> 59:20.856
No, it's too dangerous.

59:20.858 --> 59:22.124
Are you okay?

59:22.126 --> 59:24.993
Yeah, I think so.

59:30.099 --> 59:31.667
No.

59:31.669 --> 59:34.202
Oh no! Damn it!

59:34.204 --> 59:35.904
The flash drive is gone.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.106
You didn't back it up online?

59:38.108 --> 59:41.109
I lied to the cops
about having a copy of it.

59:41.111 --> 59:42.878
I thought it was safe
to keep it off the cloud.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.947
Okay.

59:44.949 --> 59:47.816
Whoever did this, the judge,
the Russian gang, whoever,

59:47.818 --> 59:49.351
they're gonna
hear the full diary

59:49.353 --> 59:51.853
and know exactly
what the cops know.

59:51.855 --> 59:53.415
They're gonna want
to tie up loose ends.

59:54.891 --> 59:56.692
You got to go.

59:56.694 --> 59:58.760
Use the back door.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.262
Be careful.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.167
Becca, honey!

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:06.902
We're home.

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.672
Oh my god!
What happened in here?

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:11.940
Are you okay?

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.177
Beck?

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.245
Beck!

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:19.748
I... just flipped out.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:20.949
You did this?

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.085
I'm sorry.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.787
I just lost it.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.190
Yeah, you did.

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:33.128
Lashing out is not
gonna solve anything.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.030
Look, we all need
to keep it together.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.833
I'm okay now.

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:39.267
I'll clean up.

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.371
I'm sorry.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.669
Hey.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.137
Are you sure Christian's gone?

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:16.171
Yeah.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.339
Let's do this.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:27.949
Criminology 101, always bring
gloves to an illegal endeavor.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:30.852
Why am I not surprised
you brought designer gloves?

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.320
I got you some.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.224
Here you go.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:37.759
Gee... thanks.

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:44.032
Where'd you get that?

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.476
I have my ways.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.111
Hopefully,
they didn't canceled it.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.814
We're in luck.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.281
I think I got something.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.188
This is Dee's.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.490
Jackpot.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.068
Look, I'm telling you, all
right, I looked everywhere.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.003
All right, I had to
borrow a master key.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.471
Oh, whatever.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.174
Why won't you trust me?

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.476
I'm telling you, there's
something off about that girl.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:01.476
I don't care, all right.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:05.347
You know, Kim actually takes
my mind off of things, so...

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:10.452
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.154
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful or anything.

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:13.989
I know you're just concerned.

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.191
You're a good friend, okay?

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.094
Are you okay?

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:21.396
Sorry, Jessica slammed
my shoulder during practice.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:23.298
I'll be fine.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.533
No luck?

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.969
Can't find it.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.071
I'll have to go to admin
and get a new one, I guess.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.043
Her shoulder.

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:37.179
Yeah, so it hurts, so what?

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.453
Hello?

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.991
Uh, yeah, I mean,
if it's an emergency.

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:53.962
James wants me
to meet him in his room.

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.397
Apparently, it's urgent.

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:57.532
Fine let's go.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:00.402
He said just me. Um... I'll
catch up with you later, okay?

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:08.443
I'd know that squeal anywhere.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.878
What are you talking about?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.246
Why'd you break into her house?

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:12.914
You're both insane.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.316
I know you stole
the flash drive.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.117
You're a psycho.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.253
I tried to cut you slack
because of your sister

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.055
since I miss her too,

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:21.423
but enough is enough!

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.258
I'm calling the cops.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.492
Good, they can compare

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:26.261
your hair to the hair
on the ski mask.

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.031
I don't think she's lying.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.401
- Her shoulder.
- I hurt it during practice.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.904
You can ask the 30 people
who were there.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.472
I'm filing a restraining order.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.075
Don't come near me again.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.656
- Dad?
- This is Seth Collins.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.925
Are you there?

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:57.959
What do you want?

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.129
To tell the truth.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:03.565
I know who Diana met with
right before she died.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.433
Who?! Did you tell the cops?

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.402
No, not when I thought
it was a suicide.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.504
Look, I was a coward,

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:11.239
but I would like for us
to meet with him now.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.407
Together.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.075
Pool our intel
to give them a real shot

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.277
of finding out who did this.

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:17.112
I know that cop
thinks it was you,

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.513
but I think we can
change her mind.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.015
I'll be right there.

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:24.219
Dee's lover knows the last
person to see her alive.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.453
I got to go.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.654
Miss Wilson.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:02.524
Interesting seeing you here
at another crime scene.

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:05.226
Becca, what's going on.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.429
We all need to talk... now.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.131
We searched your room.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.566
We found this under the bed.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.501
We confirmed that
it was used to blackmail

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:15.103
Shelly and Diana,

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.972
and we're expecting it to lead
to your other victims.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:20.308
- I didn't blackmail anyone!
- How dare you!

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.278
She must have planted the burner
during the break-in.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.047
- What break-in?
- My room.

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:28.183
At our house,
I said I had a tantrum,

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:29.517
but I was attacked

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:31.753
by the same psycho who attacked
me at the hospital.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:33.455
I saw her here today

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.690
right before you stopped me.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:38.460
She's either the judge
or his muscle.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.161
Can anyone confirm?

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:43.164
I can confirm.
I was there too.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.467
I insisted we keep it quiet...

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.003
Even from my husband.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.772
Why not report it?

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:53.208
Because we didn't feel
like we could trust you.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.277
I follow evidence.

01:06:56.279 --> 01:06:58.113
You already know
about the syringe.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.347
Let's see what else we got.

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.517
This was sent anonymously.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.452
So right there,
we have obstruction,

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:07.155
b&e, evidence tampering.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.391
I'm advising my client
not to say anything else

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.092
- at this time.
- That's okay.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.427
She can listen.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.396
We also have a restraining order

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:16.531
filed by Marisa Morgan,

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.466
who was claiming that
Becca was stalking her

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:20.802
and Christian Sykes, Diana's ex.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.138
None of this will play out
in the jury without motive.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.472
My client has no history of...

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:25.507
Violence?

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.142
And regarding motive,

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:29.677
I have your client killing
her sister and Shelly noonan

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.813
to keep her
blackmail scheme quiet.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:31.813
You think that'll play?

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:36.317
As for Mr. Collins who died
in transport to the hospital

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:38.053
after being stabbed eight times,

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:38.053
we don't need motive,

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:42.257
not when we have Becca
berating him in his office...

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.658
Multiple witnesses.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.428
A jury won't need
the details of the fight

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.297
as long as they know it happened,
but this is the kicker:

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:53.334
Your client was
the last known person

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:55.570
to speak with Shelly and Seth.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:56.838
Coincidence?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.473
That's preposterous.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.675
Why would Becca
be talking to Seth?

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:02.410
He called, she answered,

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.547
talk last over a minute,
half-hour later, he's killed.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:08.216
I mean, you care to tell me
about the call?

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:10.085
The fight in the office?

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.220
Becca, don't answer that.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:15.490
We're not all the way home
on Seth's and Diana's deaths,

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:18.792
but for Shelly,
I have a kill weapon

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:22.863
with prints and enough
circumstantial to fill an ocean.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:26.634
Roll up on your drakony contacts
and we'll talk deal.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.569
In the mean time,

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:30.404
Rebecca Wilson,
you're under arrest

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.240
for the murder of Shelly noonan

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:33.575
- and the blackmail...
- Mom!

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.343
- My god, you can't do this!
- Do not say anything!

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:36.778
Do not say anything
without Daryl present.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:36.778
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:40.615
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.250
Becca, we will
have you out tonight.

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.818
Do not say anything!

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.587
Honey.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.399
I can't believe
they think I did it.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.607
Should I be scared, daddy?

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:11.279
You guys believe me
about Dee, right?

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.814
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:16.684
Of course.

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.573
Christian is the judge.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.441
I took a photo of his GPS log.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:42.944
Right there, see.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.383
I can prove who the judge is,
but I need your help.

01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:50.653
Where are you going?

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:54.221
You can't leave the house
with that thing on.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:56.191
- You'll be back in jail.
- I know it's my fault

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:56.191
that I'm in this mess...

01:09:56.193 --> 01:10:00.562
But I'm also the only one
who can get myself out of it.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:02.597
Sorry, mom.
Got to go.

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.701
If I can't stop you,

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.636
tell me how I can help.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.243
What happened to the anklet?

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.446
My mom and bolt cutters.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.815
Cops are probably
swarming the house now.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:22.350
Wow.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.986
I can prove
Christian's the judge

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:26.554
if you'll still help me.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.657
You got a raw deal.
I'll help you if I can.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.860
I want to be
the judge's next victim.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:35.230
- A sting?
- Exactly.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.898
I'll arrange a drop,
stake it out,

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.666
and catch the jerk red-handed.

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:41.002
Cleaning your name
and getting Dee full justice

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:42.604
in one fell swoop, not bad.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.006
One hitch.

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:47.775
The judge has to think
the blackmail is his idea.

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:49.711
I guess it would be suspicious

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.279
if you asked to be blackmailed.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.882
I need you to plant the
idea in Christian's head.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.384
What's the bait?

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.887
I found a stash of jewels
in Dee's room,

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:02.257
some sugar-daddy bling
from Seth,

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.524
probably worth 20 grand.

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.794
What do you need me to do?

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.264
You got to tell Christian
you're at jewelers today,

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.598
shopping for one of your girls,

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.469
and you saw Kim selling
a pile of expensive pieces.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.271
So expensive the store owner

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.672
wouldn't take them
without a receipt,

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.707
which she didn't have.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:20.875
That ought to hook him.

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:24.312
I love this plan,
very femme fatale.

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:25.747
I'll tell Christian
the next time I see him.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:28.049
Uh, no, there's no time.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:28.049
Calm him and tell him now.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:31.886
How am I supposed to make
that info-dump

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:33.354
sound natural over the phone?

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:35.590
He's your friend.
Figure it out.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:38.860
Please.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.728
Okay, yeah.

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:44.465
Done.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:46.701
I promise you he bought it.

01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:47.802
Thank you.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:48.970
Yeah.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.675
Now we wait.

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.037
Are you okay?

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.606
If Christian's the judge,

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.474
he'll bring the payout
right back to his room.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:34.776
I need to know for sure.

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:35.877
What about your mom?

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.678
I thought it was safer
if I came alone.

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.056
Hey, come on.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.987
What the hell?

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.028
I put florescent powder
on the blackmail envelope.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.996
It glows in uv light.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.499
Like this one.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.835
Only the judge would spark up
like a glowworm

01:14:33.837 --> 01:14:35.236
from carrying
that envelope around.

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.873
What gave me away?

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.708
Christian's GPS log...

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.912
The one you sent me.

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:47.215
There was no record of him
being at Dee's funeral...

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.550
But he was there.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.187
The log was from
your cell, not his.

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:54.822
You took a screenshot
of your own phone

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.257
and passed it off
as Christian's.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:14:59.861
Sorry, Becca.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.929
I never meant for
things to go this way.

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:03.898
I liked you. I really did.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.634
Irina.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.678
Did you kill them all?

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.182
Seth, Shelly...

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.184
Dee?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.621
Did you kill my sister?!

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:28.723
Only the others.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:30.725
Not sister.

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:32.527
Then who did?

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.095
Some other drakony?

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.967
I'm gonna die now, just tell me.

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:47.308
I never meant to hurt her.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.776
It was an accident.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:49.977
An accident?

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:51.712
If I didn't do it,
they would kill me

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.813
and get somebody else to do it.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.081
He's right.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.018
Drakony hate loose ends,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.820
and James avoids being one...

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:01.122
Unlike you.

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:05.092
You can join your sister now.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:08.195
Any time now!

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:10.097
- Oh.
- Back away from her!

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:11.966
- Drop the weapon!
- -Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:15.202
- Whoa.
- Drop it! Now!

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:23.878
All right, all right, okay.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.012
All right, all right.

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.796
Did you get
everything you needed?

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:42.830
Yeah.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.071
How?

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.643
I can prove who the judge is,
but I need your help.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.778
You're my only chance.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.780
If any part of you
thinks I could be innocent,

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.983
please, hear me out.

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:03.184
I'm listening.

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:23.404
Hold position.
Let him leave feeling clever.

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.243
All right, you're up, ladies.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.946
Let him escape
and make it look good.

01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:34.949
We're here for a murder
confession, nothing less.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:40.388
Good job.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.220
Christian, I'm so sorry
for lying to you...

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.890
And for hurting you.

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.459
Can you forgive me?

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.296
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:39.213
- Mom!
- Oh!

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.193
Are we good?

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.096
Well, in light of new evidence,

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:56.363
and Becca's cooperation,

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.833
the da's dropping all charges.

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.904
I love you.

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.442
Good work tonight.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:22.223
I was just a small-time grifter
who ripped off the wrong guy.

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.826
The drakony found me
and made it clear

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:27.161
I had two ways
to pay off my debt:

01:19:27.163 --> 01:19:27.161
Serve or die.

01:19:27.163 --> 01:19:30.231
The next thing I know,
I'm enrolled in Cartwright

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:31.832
running an extortion scheme.

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:33.434
Get to the bodies.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.936
It started with Shelly.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.271
She said she was
gonna go to the cops.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.273
So I sent Diana
to follow her, you know,

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.841
just to scare her a little,

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:43.110
but Shelly panicked
and drove off the road.

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.881
After the accident, the drakony

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:49.984
decided to tie up
some loose ends.

01:19:49.986 --> 01:19:53.287
I went to them and I... Said I
could smooth things out myself,

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.955
you know, put my marks in line,

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.457
but they said no.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:59.527
I know what you think of me,
but I never killed anyone.

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:01.829
I didn't know what to do.

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.898
I mean, at first I thought
I'd just...

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.499
Save who I could
and get out of dodge.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:08.369
Shelly was stuck
in the hospital.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.137
There was nothing
I could do for her.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.406
So I went to Dee.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:14.141
Shh, Seth.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.810
No, there's someone here.

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:18.145
Dee, we need to talk.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.548
No, it's my friend James.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:21.982
Let me, uh, get rid of him

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.384
and I'll call you back, okay?

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:29.390
James, what are you doing here?

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.525
I know about Shelly
and the judge.

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.561
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:35.130
Yes we are!

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.032
We have to go
to the cops together!

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:39.099
You're not listening to me!

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:40.835
They're gonna kill you.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.870
You need to grab your
stuff and leave today.

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:42.870
How do you know that?

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:47.274
James, how do you know
what kill order they gave?

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:49.210
Or that I tailed
Shelly that night?

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:51.612
Or where I live for that matter?

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.514
I told you, I'm a victim too.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:54.949
James...

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.052
Are you the judge?

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:02.556
Oh my god!

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:04.191
I thought you were my friend!

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.960
- I am your friend.
- You are not!

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:07.862
You ruined my life!

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.330
- And I am going to the cops!
- Calm down!

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:10.998
Now I have a name to tell them!

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.067
- Dee, you don't want to do that.
- Yes! Yes, I do.

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.203
Just...

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.486
- You weren't paying attention...
- No, no! Get off of me!

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.295
I almost forgot.

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:43.497
I made you another copy.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:45.933
I heard you lost the last one.

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:47.601
Entry 116.

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.349
Today, I was supposed
to be out for the judge,

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:07.421
but it was Becca's play
and I couldn't miss it,

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.590
so I just stood
in the back and...

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.058
And watched her
for a few minutes.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.927
She didn't even
know I was there.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:15.996
I don't think she knows
how good she really is.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:20.367
She will be such a big success.

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:24.405
She is...
The heart of our family.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.441
I'm so proud of her.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.378
And mom and dad were there,

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.181
watching her so proudly.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.985
I love them so much.

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.558
All right, guys,
we're losing the light.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.427
Let's get this.
Roll sound.

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:49.296
- Testing.
- 137, take three, marker.

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:54.401
Right and... camera set!

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:56.270
And action, Becca!

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.541
Hey, Billy.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.244
Yeah, I would love to go out.

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:07.982
She's good.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:09.650
Yes, I know.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.118
Dee, would be proud.

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:14.321
Really?

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:15.656
Okay, cut!

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:16.690
That's cut!
