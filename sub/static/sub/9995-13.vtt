00:07.900 --> 00:12.090
whose eyes are constantly on
the hunt for shades not pulled,

00:12.820 --> 00:16.570
the shutters not fully closed.

00:16.580 --> 00:20.520
A coward cloaked in anonymity,

00:20.530 --> 00:25.450
he tells himself that
watching is a victimless crime.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.670
After all, she'd be undressing anyway.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.570
Until he sees something
he wasn't counting on.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.390
Does he speak up, give up his anonymity,

00:38.400 --> 00:42.960
or keep silent, pretend he didn't see?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:51.350 --> 00:53.380
You okay?

00:54.730 --> 00:57.720
Yeah... just a dream.

00:57.730 --> 01:01.260
It was nothing. It was stupid.

01:01.870 --> 01:05.150
Well,that's not fair,sneaking
out while I'm sleeping.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.820
Where you going?

01:06.830 --> 01:09.650
Home. I need to spend
a night in my own bed.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.240
I need to spend a morning
in my own bathroom.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.730
Don't go anywhere. I sleep
better when you're here.

01:14.740 --> 01:18.600
Man up. Learn to sleep
alone. All the big kids do it.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.400
It's Kim Furlong.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.130
Hmm,she wants me to call her.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.920
Kim? Monday Tennis Kim?

01:27.930 --> 01:30.240
It's 11:40. You sure you don't
want to wait till tomorrow?

01:30.250 --> 01:33.230
I don't know. She and her husband
haven't been getting along.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.760
She must need to talk.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.530
You all right? Another dream?

02:14.840 --> 02:15.890
Yeah.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.880
This one stupid,too?

02:17.890 --> 02:20.000
I wish.

02:20.010 --> 02:21.910
You want to tell me about it?

02:21.940 --> 02:27.360
I don't know. There were... there were
people we knew in it: Scanlon and Lynn DiNovi.

02:27.370 --> 02:30.830
Okay. What happened
to them? Something bad?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.530
No,they were in bed.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.880
Excellent. Tell me more.

02:34.890 --> 02:39.100
Ugh,I felt like a peeping
Tom. I guess I should call.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.490
What time is it?

02:41.500 --> 02:44.910
Almost exactly 11:40.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.820
It's Kim Furlong. Hmm,she
wants me to call her.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.690
Kim? Monday Tennis Kim?

02:51.700 --> 02:53.990
It's 11:40. You sure you don't
want to wait till tomorrow?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.960
I don't know. She and her husband
haven't been getting along.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.680
She must need to talk.

03:06.110 --> 03:06.910
Scanlon.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.560
Lee,don't ask me how, but I know
Lynn is there with you right now

03:10.570 --> 03:13.060
and I know she's trying
to reach a friend of hers.

03:13.090 --> 03:16.130
Get the address from Lynn and
send an ambulance there now.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.630
I'm not getting any answer.

03:17.650 --> 03:18.520
Uh,well,that's okay.

03:18.530 --> 03:20.780
You can hang up now 'cause I
got Allison Dubois on the phone

03:20.790 --> 03:23.410
and,apparently,she's
got all the answers.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.130
I'm gonna hand you to Lynn.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.110
Uh,and Allison,do me a
favor and close your eyes.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.630
I got to get out of bed now
and I'm not wearing any clothes.

04:18.660 --> 04:23.140
xplain that we knew
to send an ambulance?

04:25.550 --> 04:29.110
I guess we'll just cross that
bridge when we come to it.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.370
I don't know what to tell you. I mean...

04:45.120 --> 04:49.360
we had a fight, a stupid fight
over a business trip I had to take,

04:49.370 --> 04:52.290
and I went to sleep in the guest room.

04:52.300 --> 04:56.000
Next thing I know,there's
an ambulance at the door.

04:58.130 --> 05:03.670
I-I guess she must have been in some
kind of distress and called them.

05:04.990 --> 05:09.440
It's a dream,right? It's
just a horrible dream.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.960
Tomorrow I'll wake up and she'll be
fine and then we'll make up and it...

05:13.970 --> 05:17.840
it'll just never have happened.

05:34.150 --> 05:36.760
Thank you.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.070
For,uh, calling.

05:40.950 --> 05:42.650
Thank you,Allison.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.920
I don't know... I don't
know what good it did.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.090
I don't know what difference it made.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.740
I am so sorry,Lynn.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.430
JOE: Everybody have plates?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.510
I don't want to get over there with this
hot pan and find out there are no plates.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.850
Everybody has plates.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.810
What about silverware?

06:03.820 --> 06:05.720
Ariel's supposed to do the silverware.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.450
Yeah,but Ariel's not here
yet and the eggs are done.

06:08.470 --> 06:09.940
Ariel!

06:09.950 --> 06:11.810
Bridge,don't do that.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.050
Mommy's still asleep.
She was out all night.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.460
I'll get the silverware.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.640
- Dad...
- Yeah?

06:21.650 --> 06:25.030
Marie's creasing up her face again.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.300
What are you talking about?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.580
Take a look.

06:30.930 --> 06:33.620
Honey, why are you doing that?

06:33.630 --> 06:36.150
Doing what?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.600
What are you smiling about,hmm?

06:45.610 --> 06:46.910
No,don't tell me. Let me guess.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.000
You got a full night's sleep.

06:49.010 --> 06:52.430
You're not doing too badly
yourself. It's a quarter to 1:00.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.950
You're kidding.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.590
Did everybody get to school okay?

06:55.610 --> 06:59.410
Uh-huh,everyone and
everything is just lovely.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.690
And you know what else?

07:01.700 --> 07:03.660
I got my first salary check.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.800
Came in the mail today from
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises, Inc. LLC.

07:07.810 --> 07:12.360
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises,Inc. LLC.

07:12.370 --> 07:14.250
- I like it.
- Yeah, and not a moment too soon,

07:14.260 --> 07:17.620
'cause I think the little one
is in need of a pair of glasses.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.640
In need of what?

07:19.650 --> 07:21.250
JOE: So I called around.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.660
Everyone wants to know what
kind of insurance we have,

07:23.670 --> 07:27.390
and then when I'd explain to them that we
actually don't have any insurance at the moment

07:27.400 --> 07:30.560
I could literally hear the doctors'
schedules magically fill up.

07:30.570 --> 07:34.340
"And I'm really sorry, but we don't
have anything for at least two months."

07:34.680 --> 07:35.980
You all right?

07:35.990 --> 07:38.380
Yeah,I just have a headache.
So what are we going to do?

07:38.390 --> 07:40.600
Well,I finally found someone.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.450
Actually specializes
in children's optometry.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.680
It's just I had to give
him a credit card number,

07:45.700 --> 07:48.930
like making a reservation
for a hotel or something.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.550
I'm gonna take her over there tomorrow.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.320
Oh,I'll get it. I'll get it.

07:53.330 --> 07:56.830
Hey,don't open that door.
Check who it is first.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.070
It's probably for me.

07:58.080 --> 08:02.020
Meghan said that she might messenger over
some paperwork about competing projects.

08:02.030 --> 08:05.020
I can't wait to meet
this Meghan,actually.

08:05.030 --> 08:05.760
Thanks,Bridge.

08:05.770 --> 08:08.540
- It's for Mommy.
- Oh,thanks.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.540
What is it,Mommy?

08:13.550 --> 08:17.590
It's,uh,just a favor that
Mommy did for a friend,

08:17.600 --> 08:19.760
got involved in something that's
really none of my business.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.260
I'm gonna take a look at this later.

08:21.270 --> 08:24.490
Right now, Mommy's
fighting off a headache.

08:27.130 --> 08:30.460
So your new business partner...

08:30.470 --> 08:32.570
how old would you say she is?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.260
I don't know.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.460
Couple years older than you,maybe?

08:36.470 --> 08:37.909
What an excellent answer.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.330
You can continue to be my husband.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.770
Mm,you're too kind.

08:42.809 --> 08:44.870
Is she married?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.820
I honestly don't know.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.880
Does she have a ring?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.130
I didn't really notice.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.000
Well,how could you not notice?

08:55.010 --> 08:56.810
I don't know.

08:56.830 --> 08:59.780
I'm a boy; it's one of the differences.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.660
We don't notice rings.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.890
We pee standing up.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.260
You have to take this
up with someone else.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.750
Hello?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.370
Sorry to call so late.
Hope I didn't wake anyone.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.410
You get that care package I sent over?

09:17.420 --> 09:19.850
The photographs?Yeah,they
got here earlier,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.570
but frankly,Lee, I'm not
sure why I'm looking at them.

09:24.270 --> 09:27.890
It's not like I dream about
my friends on a regular basis.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.640
In fact,I almost never do.

09:30.650 --> 09:33.080
And it's like you said--
there's no crime here.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.070
That girl just fell down
and split her head open.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.520
Yeah, that's what I'm calling about.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.840
Coroner suspects foul play.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.110
What are you talking about?
What kind of foul play?

09:43.120 --> 09:46.460
Lynn's friend was poisoned-- some
kind of extreme muscle relaxant.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.700
Poisoned?

09:48.710 --> 09:51.870
Are you sure it wasn't
an accidental overdose?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.110
No,it's not looking that way.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.240
All they found in her
stomach was a martini,

09:55.250 --> 09:58.640
some breakfast cereal,and a
couple of Adviprin capsules.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.690
I'm bringing her hubby in
for questioning tomorrow.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.380
I was wondering if you might
be interested in listening in.

10:04.390 --> 10:06.920
I don't think I can get you paid,but...

10:06.940 --> 10:09.800
Lynn and I would consider
it a personal favor.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.010
Are you okay?

10:11.660 --> 10:13.760
Allison?

10:16.190 --> 10:21.500
I... you know what? I'm not feeling great
and I,I just have this wicked headache.

10:23.580 --> 10:24.990
Hey,wait a second.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
What did you say that they found in her?

10:28.010 --> 10:30.230
Uh,in her blood or in her stomach?

10:30.250 --> 10:34.430
In her stomach they found some
cereal,some booze, and some Adviprin.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.620
Allison?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.900
Hello? Allison?

10:54.910 --> 10:58.850
Excuse me. Sir? I
need you over here,sir.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.730
Thank you. That's right. Come over here.

11:02.950 --> 11:06.150
She'll be fine back there.
They'll take good care of her.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.290
All right,I'm putting through
these two credit cards,

11:08.300 --> 11:11.800
but if they don't clear, I-I don't
know what to tell you, Mr. Dubois.

11:11.810 --> 11:13.220
You sure you don't have insurance?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.160
I'm positive.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.610
Mr. Dubois? Mr. Joseph Dubois?

11:16.620 --> 11:18.010
Yeah? That's me.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.330
How's my wife? Did she
regain consciousness?

11:20.340 --> 11:25.290
No. Uh,yes. I mean,she's still out.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.680
But she seems... fine.

11:27.690 --> 11:30.530
I mean,in every measurable
way,absolutely fine.

11:30.540 --> 11:34.620
Actually,if I didn't know any better,
I'd be tempted to tell you she's simply...

11:34.640 --> 11:36.900
asleep.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.260
Even though we can't wake her.

11:39.270 --> 11:41.460
But she's not in a coma,not...

11:41.470 --> 11:45.010
if you look at her brain waves. If
you look at her brain waves, she's...

11:45.340 --> 11:47.230
asleep.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.270
Joe.

12:04.610 --> 12:06.580
I'm sorry.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.090
I'm sorry. I really am.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.810
What are you talking about?

12:29.820 --> 12:32.610
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.

12:32.620 --> 12:34.790
Look,I know you didn't choose to...

12:34.820 --> 12:38.120
pass out,fall asleep-- whatever
it was that happened back there.

12:38.130 --> 12:39.340
Joe...

12:39.360 --> 12:40.830
So what did you dream?

12:40.840 --> 12:43.070
That must have been
a hell of a dream,huh?

12:43.080 --> 12:45.450
You see where Jimmy Hoffa was buried?

12:45.460 --> 12:49.480
Did Lee Harvey Oswald whisper
something to you about a second gunman?

12:49.490 --> 12:51.470
Talk to me.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.910
Is it going to be Obama or Hillary?
Inquiring minds want to know.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.930
You're so angry. Why
do you sound so angry?

12:55.940 --> 12:57.990
"Why?" Uh,well...

12:58.000 --> 13:02.460
Well,let's start with that
was a $500 nap you just took.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.270
And,oh,wait, here's another.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.890
Uh,you scared the crap out of me. "Why?"

13:16.440 --> 13:18.980
Oh,my God.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.870
What are you doing? What's going on?

13:23.880 --> 13:26.800
I didn't dream anything.

13:26.810 --> 13:29.040
Okay.

13:29.050 --> 13:31.090
At the hospital. You
asked me what I dreamt.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.340
I said I didn't dream anything.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.150
Nothing at all.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.910
I think that was the point.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.490
Lee,I know it's the
middle of the night...

13:44.500 --> 13:48.520
Look,if this is about me leaving the
seat up just now, it's not a big deal.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.570
I'm here by myself tonight.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.390
But if it'll get you off the
phone, I'll go back in and lower it.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.450
Stop kidding around.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.420
I need to know what's going
on with Kim Furlong's husband.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.780
Well,it's like I said earlier.

13:58.790 --> 13:59.900
I'm bringing him in tomorrow.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.350
I'd love to have you there.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.480
Also getting a search warrant
so I can go through the house.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.160
See if we can find that poison.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.470
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.740
I should've called you hours
ago. It just didn't occur to me.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.660
You need to look under the bed.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.290
Check under the bed for
a bottle of Adviprin.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.550
I have a hunch that you're going
to find your poison in there.

14:15.570 --> 14:16.160
So wait a second.

14:16.180 --> 14:20.290
You're saying there's a bottle of Adviprin
under the bed and the poison's in the bottle?

14:20.310 --> 14:22.710
In the capsules.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.140
MARIE: Cow. Horse, pig,duck.

14:27.150 --> 14:31.000
That's perfect. That's
absolutely perfect.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.920
This child has perfect vision.

14:32.930 --> 14:35.830
Cow,horse,pig,duck-- that's
perfect. That's 20/20.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.940
Well,I-I don't understand it.

14:37.950 --> 14:39.290
There's nothing to understand.

14:39.300 --> 14:44.010
She sees every animal, no
matter how big or small it is.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.830
You know these charts by
heart,don't you,doctor?

14:48.850 --> 14:50.330
That's what I listen to all day.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.820
Kids reading these
charts. Why do you ask?

14:52.830 --> 14:56.910
Well,I was,uh,wondering, were
you thinking about it just now?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.940
I mean,when my daughter was looking at the
chart, were you running through it in your head?

14:59.950 --> 15:01.340
Your daughter has perfect vision.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.770
What is or isn't in
my head is immaterial.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.740
Now,if you or your wife have your
heart set on her wearing glasses...

15:06.750 --> 15:09.350
- Nobody has their heart set on it.
- I can sell you some frames with optically clear lenses.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.840
I just know that my
daughter needs glasses.

15:10.850 --> 15:13.390
And that is the end of this examination.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.150
Thank you,Mr. Dubois.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.300
Nice to meet you,Marie.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.890
Honey? Do me a favor.
Read the chart again.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.590
- That chart?
- Yeah.

15:29.030 --> 15:31.580
Is that an animal?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.790
- Hi,Lynn.
- Russell.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.570
Detective.

15:46.870 --> 15:50.390
Ma'am,I-I came over as
soon as I got the message.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.610
Mr. Furlong,I know this
is a difficult time.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.040
I know you have a lot of
things to do and figure out,

15:55.070 --> 15:58.320
but I was wondering if I could
ask you just a couple of questions?

15:58.340 --> 16:00.480
Get your opinion on a couple of things?

16:00.490 --> 16:03.140
Yeah,I-I've got my
in-laws flying in.

16:03.150 --> 16:07.130
They're going to be landing in
about an hour,20, but... yeah,sure.

16:14.730 --> 16:18.390
Are you aware of
anybody that might've...

16:18.400 --> 16:21.500
might've wanted to see your wife dead?

16:22.100 --> 16:23.500
Excuse me?

16:23.510 --> 16:27.590
Your wife. Did she have any enemies?

16:29.560 --> 16:31.320
I'm confused. Why are
you asking me that?

16:31.330 --> 16:34.200
My wife died in an accident.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.770
Russell...

16:36.780 --> 16:39.680
Kim was murdered.

16:40.050 --> 16:42.950
No,she wasn't.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.920
No,she wasn't. She,she tripped and fell.

16:45.930 --> 16:48.790
She cracked her head and bled to death.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.000
Yes,Mr. Furlong.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.260
She was poisoned,actually.

16:53.290 --> 16:56.240
And when the poison made it impossible
for her to get blood to her brain,

16:56.250 --> 16:58.670
she fell and cracked her skull open.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.930
But it was the poison in
her blood that killed her,

17:00.940 --> 17:04.589
not the fall or the
bleeding or the fracture.

17:05.060 --> 17:08.160
But who-who would do
something like that and why?

17:08.190 --> 17:10.210
That's what we're here to find out.

17:10.220 --> 17:14.200
We have a hunch that the answer lies in
the pain reliever your wife was taking.

17:14.210 --> 17:16.300
I believe that the bottle
might've rolled under the bed.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.859
Do you think it's still there?

17:18.869 --> 17:21.130
Nobody's touched that room.
The police told us not to.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.250
I-I mean me and the housekeeper.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.140
So the bottle should still be there?

17:25.150 --> 17:26.450
I'm sure it is.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.410
I've already asked a
judge for a search warrant.

17:28.430 --> 17:31.220
As soon as it comes through do you mind
if I sent an officer by to pick it up?

17:31.240 --> 17:32.610
You don't have to wait
for a search warrant.

17:32.620 --> 17:35.890
I mean,if something criminal has gone on
here, I mean,I'll call the house right now.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.850
My housekeeper's there. Just have an
officer go by and collect whatever you need.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.530
I told you.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.490
It would also be helpful,
just to rule yours out,

17:46.510 --> 17:50.910
if we could get a set of
fingerprints,a DNA swab of your cheek.

17:50.930 --> 17:53.340
Yes,well,whatever you need.

17:53.350 --> 17:56.010
Oh,just one more thing,Mr. Furlong.

17:56.020 --> 18:00.970
On the night that your wife died, you
mentioned that the two of you were fighting.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.180
What are you trying to say?

18:08.470 --> 18:09.910
What is he trying to say?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.600
I'm trying to say that I appreciate
how cooperative you're being.

18:12.620 --> 18:17.780
And I'm trying to say I understand that you're
a friend of a friend, but if I were you...

18:17.790 --> 18:21.840
I'd make a little time today to find
yourself a good criminal attorney.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.060
Just in case.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.360
I'm telling you, she was
reading the guy's mind.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.270
I mean,he knew exactly what
the animals was supposed to be,

18:29.280 --> 18:32.330
so she knew exactly what the
animals was supposed to be.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.480
As soon as he left the room,
she couldn't see a thing.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.130
Maybe we should try another optometrist.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.650
I don't want to try another optometrist.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.190
I can't afford another optometrist.

18:40.210 --> 18:42.580
Besides,I've already
paid for this optometrist.

18:42.600 --> 18:46.450
He misdiagnosed our daughter,
and I want him to get it right.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.370
Can you remind these
people that we have kids?

18:52.860 --> 18:54.200
Hello?

18:54.210 --> 18:55.650
So what are you doing?

18:55.660 --> 18:57.580
I'm sitting in bed with
my husband complaining

18:57.590 --> 19:01.360
'cause people call at all
hours even though we have kids.

19:01.370 --> 19:03.120
What are you doing?

19:03.130 --> 19:05.960
Sitting in a bar with my
girlfriend drinking too much.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.640
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

19:08.650 --> 19:13.500
You've met Furlong twice now. Any
impressions? Any feelings about him?

19:13.510 --> 19:16.560
Well,I sit in the room with him.
I see the same things you see.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.930
I hear the same things you hear. Why?

19:18.940 --> 19:21.260
You were right about the Adviprin.

19:21.270 --> 19:23.360
That's where we found the poison.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.450
We also found Furlong's
fingerprints all over the bottle.

19:26.470 --> 19:28.980
Well,it was his bottle.
It was in his house.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.730
And on every single capsule
in it along with a tiny hole

19:31.740 --> 19:36.180
where someone injected the poison
through the gelatin capsule casing.

19:36.190 --> 19:40.280
Officers just went over to the
house now to place him under arrest.

19:40.290 --> 19:42.440
Do you have anything to add?

19:42.450 --> 19:44.050
No,just that I'm sorry.

19:44.060 --> 19:47.140
I'm sorry I,I didn't do more to help.

19:47.150 --> 19:50.520
I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.140
How's Lynn doing?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.820
She's doing.

19:56.130 --> 19:59.540
Go back to your husband. Get some
sleep. I'll call you in the morning.

20:05.290 --> 20:07.760
Is everything all right?

20:08.750 --> 20:13.100
A woman was poisoned. Turns out it
was her husband. I met the guy twice.

20:13.110 --> 20:16.210
I didn't even get an inkling.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.200
I guess he loved her once.

20:21.210 --> 20:23.980
Just makes me sad.

20:27.280 --> 20:31.650
Claims. No,this isn't India.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.890
This is America. How may I help you,sir?

20:35.850 --> 20:37.340
I'm sorry?

20:37.350 --> 20:41.110
Are you asking me who the
President of the United States is?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.550
What is this,some kind of test?

20:43.620 --> 20:49.650
I told you I'm in America,
the United States of America.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.410
Well,I don't like your attitude.

21:08.270 --> 21:10.770
Ms. Hastings?

21:10.780 --> 21:13.360
Is there some special reason
you're not on the telephone?

21:13.370 --> 21:15.730
The incoming call
board is completely red.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.240
I'm sorry.

21:17.250 --> 21:20.320
The last caller was a jerk and...

21:20.350 --> 21:23.170
honestly,I have these cramps.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.120
I feel like crap.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.870
Trust me, Ms. Hastings,
we all feel like crap.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.290
There's not a single person working
here who when they were six years old

21:31.300 --> 21:35.120
dreamed of answering phones in the
claims department of an insurance agency.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.990
That's why we pay you.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
To take some of the sting out of it.

21:40.470 --> 21:43.880
If I could just go to
the restroom for a minute.

21:43.890 --> 21:47.900
If you leave your desk,
don't bother coming back.

21:48.250 --> 21:52.810
So then she said that if I
left, not to bother coming back.

21:52.820 --> 21:56.500
No,really, that is what she said.

21:56.510 --> 21:59.440
I'm at the car.

21:59.450 --> 22:03.020
No. I'm at the car.

22:03.380 --> 22:07.680
Of course I'm fine. All
I took were two Adviprin.

22:07.690 --> 22:10.150
See you at home.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.530
- Dad?
- Yeah?

23:14.540 --> 23:17.180
Do we look alike?

23:17.190 --> 23:20.230
That's not funny. That's
not even a little funny.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.320
I mean, if you can't see the
TV, I'm happy to turn the TV off.

23:23.330 --> 23:28.080
I can see the TV. I can see the
TV fine. I can see the TV great.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.500
Yeah. I had a hunch.

23:30.510 --> 23:34.190
I still need you to help me
figure out this optometrist thing.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.130
Hello? You gonna get off there soon?

23:36.140 --> 23:39.690
I got some stuff I need to print out for this
meeting with,uh, Meghan and the model maker.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.850
Ariel?

23:40.860 --> 23:43.730
Hey,give me another word
for a parking garage.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.830
Uh,parking structure, public parking.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.680
Car park,I think they
call it in England.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.900
Guess it hasn't happened yet.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.540
What are you doing?

23:52.550 --> 23:54.000
Did you just shut off the computer?

23:54.020 --> 23:54.960
Why did you shut off the computer?

23:54.980 --> 23:58.240
I told you I had a
meeting to-to prepare for.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.040
Ariel?

24:00.050 --> 24:01.500
You know I'm getting the kids breakfast.

24:01.510 --> 24:03.940
I'm probably taking them
to school, and,you know,

24:03.960 --> 24:07.010
somehow I'm supposed to
be ready for this meeting.

24:07.020 --> 24:09.510
Sorry. I'm sorry. It was an accident.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.440
I wasn't listening. I wasn't
paying attention. Here.

24:12.450 --> 24:16.480
Prepare for your meeting.
I'll take the girls to school.

24:16.860 --> 24:20.610
I was going to run in to
downtown to see Scanlon anyway.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.910
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.850
A car drive off the
roof of a parking garage?

24:25.890 --> 24:27.320
No. I'm pretty sure I
would have heard about that.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.120
That's the kind of thing
someone would have noticed.

24:29.130 --> 24:30.610
That's the kind of thing
they'd bring up at roll call.

24:30.620 --> 24:32.160
Okay. So maybe it hasn't happened yet.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.830
Or maybe it didn't happen in Phoenix.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.190
Which is great,'cause maybe we
could stop it from happening.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.820
Maybe we can put out a warning.

24:37.830 --> 24:38.590
What kind of warning?

24:38.600 --> 24:41.350
This woman took Adviprin
right before it happened.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.780
Well,at least she won't have a
headache when she hits the sidewalk.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.240
I'm serious! I'm starting to think this has
nothing to do with Kim Furlong's husband.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.620
I think there's something wrong
with Adviprin-- all of it--

24:49.650 --> 24:51.180
and we're going to be
seeing a lot more of this.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.740
Well,if and when we do, we'll
react accordingly, but right now,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.360
what I'm being told by people a
hell of a lot smarter than I am

24:56.370 --> 25:01.420
is that this Adviprin was adulterated not in the
manufacturing process, but sometime afterwards.

25:01.430 --> 25:03.940
Maybe Mr. Furlong wasn't
just mad at his wife.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.320
Maybe he had a beef with,uh...

25:05.350 --> 25:07.830
Hastings. Her last name's Hastings.
I think we need to find her.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.170
This Hastings woman.

25:09.180 --> 25:12.990
Maybe he didn't like the way she handled his
claim, but there's nothing for me to do now.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.580
You mean,you aren't
going to help me find her?

25:15.590 --> 25:18.190
You just told me you couldn't be
certain where this dream took place.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.460
Allison,have you got any idea how many
insurance companies there are in Phoenix?

25:21.470 --> 25:26.140
In Arizona? In the Southwest? Not to
mention, how many people named Hastings?

25:30.450 --> 25:35.220
All right. We'll set you up in one of the interview
rooms with a computer, some phone books and a phone.

25:35.230 --> 25:38.650
If anyone asks what you're doing, we'll tell 'em
you're selling tickets to the Policeman's Ball.

25:38.660 --> 25:41.710
- Do they still have a Policeman's Ball?
- Got me.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.610
No,I need another
appointment with the doctor.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.360
No,I know he's already seen my daughter,
but I need to have him see her again.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.570
I know people's eyes
don't change overnight.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.880
I'm sorry. I got to call you back.

25:55.450 --> 25:57.670
What are you doing?

26:01.450 --> 26:03.270
I thought you understood.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.580
The drawings on the green;
the charts on the yellow.

26:06.590 --> 26:10.270
Calm down,man. We'll fix it. It's paper.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.960
Where you going?

26:11.970 --> 26:13.040
To get the yellow.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.750
You don't have the yellow?

26:14.760 --> 26:16.630
Not up here. I'm not a mind reader,man.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.020
It's got nothing to do with being a
mind reader. I told you about the yellow.

26:19.030 --> 26:21.580
No,you didn't, but that's
okay. I'll get some.

26:21.590 --> 26:24.380
Yeah,I did. And it has nothing
to do with being a mind reader.

26:24.390 --> 26:28.510
It has to do with listening, and you can't listen
to people when you're piping music into your brain.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.090
You can't listen. You can't concentrate.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.510
It's amazing you can
see, much less be a...

26:34.330 --> 26:37.120
Sir? You okay?

26:37.130 --> 26:41.410
Uh,yeah. No. Uh,you just
gave me an idea, actually.

26:41.420 --> 26:44.040
Okay. You still want
me to get the yellow?

26:44.050 --> 26:47.910
Yeah,definitely. Um,and
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.890
That's okay. I wasn't paying attention.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.330
This is Joe Dubois again.

26:53.340 --> 26:57.190
Uh,listen,now more than ever, I really need
that second appointment for my daughter.

26:57.220 --> 26:59.090
I know this is the
Fremont Insurance Group.

26:59.110 --> 27:04.520
I'm looking for a customer service rep,
a woman with the last name Hastings.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.290
You don't have anyone by that name?

27:08.310 --> 27:11.410
My apologies. Thank you.

27:19.850 --> 27:20.930
Hello?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.830
So what are you doing?

27:22.840 --> 27:24.580
You don't want to know.
What are you doing?

27:24.590 --> 27:27.530
Uh,you don't want to know, either,
but I'm going to tell you anyway.

27:27.540 --> 27:32.130
I'm stuck in traffic,um, so
I'm calling my wife to say

27:32.140 --> 27:36.270
that I think you probably have to stop whatever it
is you're doing and go pick up the kids from school.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.700
Oh,Joe,I don't think I can.

27:37.710 --> 27:43.370
I'm looking for a needle in an
alphabetical haystack, and I'm only up to F.

27:43.380 --> 27:45.880
I don't know what to tell
you,honey. It's non-negotiable.

27:45.890 --> 27:50.400
I'm at a dead stop. I haven't
moved a foot in 15 minutes. Sorry.

27:50.410 --> 27:53.920
Oh,and I got another appointment for
Marie with the optometrist for tomorrow.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.410
Well,that's great.

27:56.430 --> 27:58.550
You moving yet? Tell me you're moving.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.740
I'm not moving,Allison, and
I'm not going to be moving.

28:01.750 --> 28:05.090
According to the radio, I'm going
to be stuck in this mess for hours.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.270
I don't really understand
it, but they're saying

28:06.280 --> 28:10.360
that somehow a car fell off the top level
of a parking structure onto the sidewalk.

28:10.380 --> 28:15.350
Like,five or six stories, and they're saying
that they think that somebody might be inside it.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.060
Tainted Adviprin is now being suspected
in the death of Marjorie Hastings,

28:19.090 --> 28:23.810
the woman behind the wheel of this car, which
plunged seven stories to the sidewalk below.

28:23.820 --> 28:24.840
You threw ours away,right?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.360
Additionally,reports are coming
in from around the state of

28:27.370 --> 28:32.430
as many as three more deaths that are being
preliminarily linked to tampered Adviprin.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.990
Meanwhile,as the tainted
medicine scare grows,

28:35.010 --> 28:38.620
its implications were felt this
afternoon at the Phoenix Courthouse

28:38.650 --> 28:43.510
where Acting District Attorney Van Dyke
held a press conference shortly after 3:00.

28:43.530 --> 28:45.530
As I'm sure all of you are aware,

28:45.560 --> 28:48.050
we've received a number of
reports from around the state

28:48.060 --> 28:53.580
about fatalities arising from
adulterated Adviprin gelatin capsules.

28:53.590 --> 28:54.880
In light of these recent developments,

28:54.890 --> 28:59.520
my office has arranged for the
immediate release of Mr. Russell Furlong,

28:59.540 --> 29:05.290
who until this afternoon was held under suspicion
of murder in relation to the deathof his wife.

29:05.690 --> 29:06.700
Our investigation...

29:06.710 --> 29:08.490
You met the guy,right?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.750
What do you think is going
through his head right now?

29:10.770 --> 29:12.050
and the manufacturers...

29:12.060 --> 29:15.080
I mean,he loses his wife, and then
he spends a day and a half in jail.

29:15.090 --> 29:17.970
I can't even imagine it.

29:18.870 --> 29:21.230
They had a fight.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.260
I'm sorry?

29:23.270 --> 29:26.190
They had a fight the
night that she died.

29:26.200 --> 29:30.430
About some business
trip that he had to take.

29:31.080 --> 29:34.250
When we went to go see him, that
was the first thing that he told us.

29:34.260 --> 29:37.620
It didn't really stick
with me at the time, but...

29:38.550 --> 29:41.210
right now...

29:41.220 --> 29:43.650
you know,tonight...

29:45.970 --> 29:49.510
All alone in that house.

29:50.250 --> 29:53.840
I bet he really regrets that fight.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.970
It's your turn.

29:57.220 --> 30:01.110
My turn? My God. What drink is this?
How many drinks have we all had?

30:01.120 --> 30:03.790
It won't work. It's your turn.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.430
Come on. I told you about
my sister. It's your turn.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.380
Hey,Brown Eyes, we're here
for at least four more hours.

30:10.390 --> 30:13.290
- It's not like you're going to get out of it.
- I know,I know.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.590
Nobody even knows your name,fellow.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.600
Nobody knows anybody's
name, so what's the problem?

30:17.610 --> 30:21.070
There's no problem. It's just...

30:21.820 --> 30:24.970
Okay. Okay,here it is.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.880
Every night, before I fall asleep,

30:27.890 --> 30:33.090
I think about my wife...dying.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.790
What do you mean?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.910
I mean,being dead.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.260
And for a long time,I'd think
about her getting a disease--

30:39.270 --> 30:44.020
you know,cancer or
something, but,uh,lately...

30:44.610 --> 30:50.090
it's me. I do it. I kill her.

30:57.620 --> 31:01.870
do this so early, but I got to get back to
my place, pick up Lynn and get to the funeral.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.500
Say hi to the happy widower for me.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.620
I spent most of last night with him.

31:05.630 --> 31:06.610
What are you talking about?

31:06.630 --> 31:08.470
I had a dream he was talking about Kim.

31:08.490 --> 31:10.960
Talking about how he wanted her dead.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.270
Talking to who?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.970
I don't know.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.820
When did this happen?

31:15.840 --> 31:16.940
I don't know.

31:16.950 --> 31:19.220
Where did this happen?

31:20.670 --> 31:23.000
You know,when it comes to our significant
others, there are a lot of people,

31:23.010 --> 31:28.630
particularly a lot of married people,
who say things they don't mean.

31:28.650 --> 31:32.270
I'll be sure to mention that
to your significant other.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.790
Allison,we've got five fatalities
attributed to this Adviprin.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.810
Are you trying to tell me that you
think Furlong knocked them all off?

31:38.820 --> 31:40.170
I don't know. Maybe.

31:40.180 --> 31:42.790
Well,now,that makes no sense.
How the hell would he do that?

31:42.800 --> 31:46.670
You said that something was injected
into the capsules. A muscle relaxant.

31:46.680 --> 31:49.830
He could have done it to more than
one bottle, more than one person.

31:49.840 --> 31:55.390
You kill five people to disguise the fact
that you really only care about killing one.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.030
Sorry. I'm not buying it.

32:03.810 --> 32:06.240
Hello again, Mr. Dubois.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.730
Please tell me that's
little Marie's twin.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.730
Ah,no such luck.

32:10.740 --> 32:16.780
Mr. Dubois,I assure you, your child was given a
completely thorough examination the last time she was here.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.610
Um,have you ever heard
of my wife,Allison Dubois?

32:20.620 --> 32:24.030
There was a lot of stuff in the
newspaper about her last year. No?

32:24.040 --> 32:28.410
Well,uh... She worked for the district
attorney's office, um,and she's very,uh...

32:28.420 --> 32:30.750
Well,she's very
sensitive, very intuitive.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.150
I don't know if you believe
in any of that stuff.

32:33.160 --> 32:38.320
You know-- talking to the dead,
dreaming of the future, reading minds?

32:38.330 --> 32:40.330
I have no idea where
you're going with this.

32:40.340 --> 32:42.770
Do you like music,Doctor?
What kind of music do you like?

32:42.780 --> 32:46.340
Actually,this is my oldest,so,uh...

32:46.360 --> 32:48.880
Uh,do you like show
tunes, The Sound of Music?

32:48.890 --> 32:52.910
Here,humor me. Just listen
to this for just a minute.

33:02.420 --> 33:05.400
Okay,sweetie... No,uh,no,no,no.

33:05.410 --> 33:07.730
No,I don't want you looking
at what line I'm pointing at.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.940
I don't want you thinking about
what line I'm pointing at over there.

33:10.960 --> 33:14.840
I just want you to listen to
Julie Andrews and watch Marie.

33:18.860 --> 33:22.200
All right,sweetie. Can you
tell me what this line says?

33:24.220 --> 33:27.390
Give me a hint,Daddy.

33:29.410 --> 33:32.110
Oh,my...

33:34.100 --> 33:36.110
Look at you, grinning from ear to ear.

33:36.120 --> 33:42.060
I've never seen someone so pleased to
discover that their child has astigmatism.

33:42.070 --> 33:43.470
You're just jealous.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.240
- Oh,really?
- That's right.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.010
'Cause I had a problem and I
figured out how to solve it.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.150
Now tell your Mack Daddy your problem.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.220
Let's see if we can turn
that frown upside-down,huh?

33:53.230 --> 33:55.010
"Mack Daddy," huh?

33:55.040 --> 33:58.910
God,you're obnoxious...
when you're so smug.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.890
Oh,yeah? Well,that's a small price to
pay for the thrill of being with me.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.920
Now,come on, I can hear the gears
mashing in your brain from here.

34:05.930 --> 34:09.010
Come on. Tell me what's
up. What's going on?

34:10.480 --> 34:14.440
Mr. Furlong killed his wife. He killed
Lynn's friend. I just... I know it.

34:14.449 --> 34:17.050
Well,I know you know it, but the
fact remains, you can't prove it.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.420
So I think you've just got to have
faith in the system on this one.

34:19.429 --> 34:24.030
They'll eventually see what you see,
and they'll eventually catch up with him.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.150
"The system"?

34:26.159 --> 34:27.820
"Who was he talking to?"

34:27.850 --> 34:29.440
"When did this happen?"

34:29.449 --> 34:31.810
"Where did this happen?"

34:31.820 --> 34:35.050
Settle down. We gotta get some rest.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.800
"Settle down"? "We gotta get some rest"?

34:38.810 --> 34:40.389
Is that all you got, Mack Daddy?

34:40.400 --> 34:41.960
Oh,you want the best I got?

34:41.969 --> 34:45.330
Well,then don't make promises
that you can't keep,Mack Daddy.

34:45.380 --> 34:50.870
- Oh,no,no...
- No,don't write a check that you can't cash,Mack Daddy.

34:53.290 --> 34:56.330
Look at those people
over there,sleeping.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.610
How do they do that? I can't do that.

34:58.620 --> 35:01.360
They're still saying
at least another hour.

35:01.370 --> 35:03.820
They've been saying another
hour for the last three hours.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.580
Did you hear what I said? Did
any of you hear what I said?

35:06.590 --> 35:07.450
We heard you.

35:07.460 --> 35:13.870
We all heard you: my wife,his wife, your
husband, this guy's mother, your business partner.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.150
What was your brilliant idea? They
all go down in a plane together?

35:17.160 --> 35:19.690
I mean,how do we make that happen?

35:19.700 --> 35:21.880
MAN 2: You know, I'm a chemist.

35:21.910 --> 35:25.970
You remember anthrax? After
9-11? How about anthrax?

35:25.980 --> 35:27.270
Oh,yeah. Absolutely. Anthrax.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.420
You know,I have some
in my garage at home.

35:29.430 --> 35:32.740
You know what the problem
with this conversation is?

35:32.750 --> 35:35.020
I'll tell you the problem
with this conversation.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.720
You're all nuts.

35:36.730 --> 35:40.470
You're all nuts, and I'm getting
more and more sober by the minute.

35:43.230 --> 35:46.940
Hey,honey. No,I'm still here.

35:47.940 --> 35:52.010
MAN 2: Hey,does anybody remember that thing
five or ten years ago with that aspirin?

35:52.030 --> 35:55.240
Where somebody put
poison in the capsules?

36:04.060 --> 36:06.860
So now you're telling me each victim
was killed by someone close to them?

36:06.870 --> 36:08.720
Yeah,but they were all
in on this together.

36:08.730 --> 36:13.490
And you know this because of this
conversation you... overheard?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.770
Why are you so dead set against this?

36:16.780 --> 36:19.810
Why are you so resistant to this idea?

36:20.870 --> 36:23.960
I'm not stupid,Allison. We've
all been to this rodeo before.

36:23.970 --> 36:28.000
The first thing we did once we had the five victims
was check out any possible links between them,

36:28.010 --> 36:30.250
any possible links amongst
members of their families.

36:30.260 --> 36:33.080
They live all over the state. They
have absolutely nothing in common.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.870
None of them have ever so much as shared
a cell phone conversation or an e-mail.

36:35.900 --> 36:36.860
I don't believe that.

36:36.870 --> 36:39.370
Well,that's unfortunate, 'cause I have
to go testify in court in five minutes

36:39.380 --> 36:41.380
and I don't have time to
stand here and argue with you.

36:41.390 --> 36:43.550
But why don't you ask our good
friend Russell Furlong himself?

36:43.570 --> 36:45.190
What are you talking about?

36:45.200 --> 36:47.200
He's coming down here
in an hour and a half.

36:47.210 --> 36:49.740
Get caught up on everything
to do with his wife's death.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.630
The investigation at the manufacturing plant,
the interviews with the disgruntled employees.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.120
Van Dyke wants us to really handle him,
do everything we can, so that maybe,

36:57.130 --> 37:01.520
possibly,he doesn't sue the city
for locking him up last week.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.630
Happy to have you sit in.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.690
I'd like that.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.790
So at this point, what we're
primarily focused on is...

37:08.830 --> 37:12.100
how the adulteration could've taken
place during the manufacturing process,

37:12.110 --> 37:16.630
even with all these safeguards
I just told you about in place.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.500
That,plus employee interviews
and deep background checks,

37:19.510 --> 37:23.000
I got to believe we're going
to turn up something soon.

37:23.010 --> 37:26.640
All right. Okay. I mean,it sounds
like you're doing everything right.

37:26.650 --> 37:31.560
So that's five police
departments,plus the FBI, plus the FDA?

37:33.290 --> 37:37.260
Well,I agree,Detective. I... I have to
believe we're going to turn up something soon.

37:37.630 --> 37:41.450
Well,we appreciate your
confidence,Mr. Furlong.

37:42.420 --> 37:46.460
Uh,yeah. Actually...
there's one other thing.

37:46.470 --> 37:50.360
Um,Mrs. Dubois here would like
to ask you a quick question.

37:50.370 --> 37:53.530
Certainly. Certainly,
anything I can do to help.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.520
Do you recognize any of
these people,Mr. Furlong?

37:59.770 --> 38:01.400
God. Yes,of course I do.

38:01.410 --> 38:04.850
I've seen their picture in the
paper and on television. Now,these...

38:04.860 --> 38:08.390
these are the other four
people who died the way Kim did.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.110
Have you ever met any of them?

38:10.130 --> 38:11.550
Before they were dead?

38:11.560 --> 38:14.450
Oh,God. No,not that I'm aware of. Why?

38:14.460 --> 38:15.180
How about relatives?

38:15.190 --> 38:20.140
Any chance you might have met a relative of
one of these victims? Her husband or her son?

38:20.150 --> 38:21.720
- Allison...
- His wife?

38:21.730 --> 38:23.000
His business partner?

38:23.010 --> 38:24.240
Uh,what's going on here?

38:24.250 --> 38:26.630
I'm starting to feel like
a suspect again,Detective.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.010
I assure you,Mr. Furlong, the city of
Phoenix does not regard you as a suspect...

38:30.020 --> 38:31.930
I'm sorry. I didn't get a
chance to hear your answer.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.770
- Allison...
- The answer is no.

38:35.450 --> 38:38.660
To the best of my knowledge, I have
never met these people you're alluding to.

38:38.670 --> 38:41.810
I do not even know their names.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.990
But I know your name.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.940
I know who you are and I know what you do,
and I'm glad you're working on this case.

38:48.950 --> 38:52.850
I want you to find my wife's killer.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.810
But if you have somehow
convinced yourself that it's me...

38:57.110 --> 39:00.230
or that I might somehow be involved,

39:01.000 --> 39:06.050
I invite you,look into my eyes,

39:06.060 --> 39:09.360
read my mind, do whatever it is you do,
and let's just get this out of the way

39:09.370 --> 39:14.400
so that we can concentrate on finding
the bastard who actually did this.

39:23.150 --> 39:25.700
Are we done here, Allison?

39:29.270 --> 39:31.060
Thank you,Mr. Furlong.

39:31.080 --> 39:35.500
We appreciate your... confidence in us.

39:43.020 --> 39:46.260
Vision comes in many
shapes and many forms.

39:46.270 --> 39:49.060
There's the kind of
vision our eyes afford us.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.970
Fantastic! You look beautiful!

39:52.980 --> 39:57.040
You look beautiful.
You look so grown up.

39:57.050 --> 40:00.740
There's the kind of vision
our wisdom affords us.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.880
Pay phone?

40:02.890 --> 40:05.630
Okay,I'm stumped. I have
no idea what that means.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.100
Well,that makes two of us.

40:09.150 --> 40:11.920
- I love you.
- I love you.

40:12.550 --> 40:18.080
And there's the kind of vision that
comes from things sensed, things dreamt.

40:18.090 --> 40:21.070
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

40:21.080 --> 40:24.350
At this time,TransCoast Airways
is pleased to announce that

40:24.360 --> 40:27.670
the folks here at JFK have
finally cleared one runway

40:27.680 --> 40:30.690
and we will be resuming
jet service this evening.

40:30.700 --> 40:35.730
So at this time, we would like to
board Flight 414 to Phoenix,Arizona.

40:35.740 --> 40:39.000
So when we get on the plane,
there can't be any conversation.

40:39.010 --> 40:40.290
We can't even acknowledge each other.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.490
Okay. Yeah.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.300
You understand how it works,right?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.320
No e-mails, no cell phones.

40:45.330 --> 40:47.680
What are you talking about?
Nobody even knows anybody's name.

40:47.690 --> 40:50.590
So I'm coming back through
New York next Tuesday.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.230
This is the number of the pay
phone right outside lounge here.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.500
I'll be there from 7:00 to 7:20.

40:57.510 --> 41:02.330
Whoever wants to go through with this, just find
a pay phone wherever you are and dial that number.

41:02.340 --> 41:05.180
This is nuts,you know?
What if I change my mind?

41:05.190 --> 41:07.160
What if somebody changes their mind?

41:07.170 --> 41:10.010
Don't call. Have a nice flight.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.590
Yeah. Have a nice flight.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.870
Yeah,right. A lot to think about.

41:35.820 --> 41:38.920
Want to hear a funny
coincidence,Mr. Furlong?

41:38.930 --> 41:42.360
Last January 16, there was
a blizzard in the Northeast.

41:42.370 --> 41:45.570
A flight from New York to Phoenix
was grounded for over 14 hours.

41:45.580 --> 41:47.990
You were on that flight, weren't you?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.310
I might've been.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.980
So was her husband.

41:52.990 --> 41:54.960
So was his wife.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.730
So was her son.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.430
So was his business partner.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.130
Okay. And what does that prove?

42:01.140 --> 42:04.070
Nothing... yet.

42:04.080 --> 42:08.110
But there are five of you, and we
know all the names, even if you don't.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.440
One of you will slip.

42:10.460 --> 42:13.970
One of you will crack, and
we'll be watching when you do.

42:13.980 --> 42:19.510
And then there's the kind of vision
that comes from patience and persistence.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.100
What do we make of the peeping Tom?

42:23.110 --> 42:26.720
The nocturnal voyeur...

42:28.230 --> 42:33.210
his eyes on the hunt for someone
to slip, someone to crack.
