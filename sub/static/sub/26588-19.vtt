00:01.120 --> 00:03.250
Dre: As a parent, you want
to protect your baby

00:03.250 --> 00:04.750
from everything.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.750
Like stairs...

00:06.750 --> 00:09.210
Poison...

00:09.210 --> 00:10.460
And White people
trying to touch their hair.

00:10.460 --> 00:11.290
It's beautiful.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.750
But once
they hit middle school,

00:15.750 --> 00:18.380
the biggest thing you have
to protect them from

00:18.380 --> 00:19.670
is themselves.

00:19.670 --> 00:22.460
Jack: Jack Johnson,
cinnamon challenge, 2019.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.080
Esskeetit!

00:28.460 --> 00:29.750
Damn it, Jack!

00:29.750 --> 00:31.290
I'm Jack Johnson,

00:31.290 --> 00:33.750
and this is
the flu season challenge.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.670
Esskeetit.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.250
Damn it, Jack!

00:41.250 --> 00:43.170
2019 Nitro Circus
Challenge!

00:44.750 --> 00:47.040
Esskeetit!

00:51.380 --> 00:53.540
Damn it, Jack!

00:53.540 --> 00:55.670
Did I esskeetit?

00:55.670 --> 00:57.580
So I was on high-alert

00:57.580 --> 01:01.000
for situations where Jack
could get himself into trouble.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.790
Guess who got
new outfits

01:02.790 --> 01:04.880
for the school
dance!

01:04.880 --> 01:07.170
I don't know why she does that.
It's me and Jack.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.580
It's gonna be
so much fun.

01:09.580 --> 01:10.790
Mm-hmm.

01:10.790 --> 01:13.210
No. It's not.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.670
Because
I'm chaperoning.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.580
Esskeetit! Esskeetit!
Esskeetit! Esskeetit!

01:16.580 --> 01:18.040
Esskeetit!

01:23.330 --> 01:26.080
I-I'll pay you $50 cash
if you don't chaperone.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.500
You protesting
only tells me

01:28.500 --> 01:31.120
that you plan on doing
some dirt at the dance.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.040
You played yourself.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.210
Damn it, Jack.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.380
Okay, Dad,
if you're not going

01:36.380 --> 01:37.960
to back out of it for him,
just do it for me.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.880
If you show up dancing
and being all you,

01:39.880 --> 01:41.880
the kids at school
will treat me like Jack.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.540
Baby girl, we all
have a price to pay for Jack,

01:44.540 --> 01:46.710
and sadly,
this is yours.

01:46.710 --> 01:47.960
It's the Jack Tax.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.040
Mom...

01:49.040 --> 01:50.040
Don't worry sweetie.
I got you.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.540
Thank you.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.210
So glad I have
one parent who gets it.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.580
Hey.
Come on, Jack.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.120
Let's go try on your outfit,
and I'll tell you

01:56.120 --> 01:58.670
what's gonna get you roasted
at the dance. Let's go.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.250
I think his outfit
is very nice.

02:02.670 --> 02:04.460
Dre, I think maybe

02:04.460 --> 02:06.040
you should pass
on the chaperoning.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.380
I don't want you
to embarrass Diane.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.500
I get that, but
I'm worried about Jack.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.920
I know.
Someone needs
to be around

02:10.920 --> 02:12.880
to keep an eye on him
during his experimental phase,

02:12.880 --> 02:15.290
especially at
a private school dance

02:15.290 --> 02:16.960
where there's drugs,
alcohol,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.500
and all kinds
of other stuff.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.210
You're right. You should be
there to look out for Jack.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.420
Thank you.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.120
But you cannot --

02:24.120 --> 02:27.500
under any
circumstances --

02:27.500 --> 02:29.040
dance.
What?

02:29.040 --> 02:31.540
I will not
let you embarrass Diane.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.250
But what if
they play my jam?
No.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.790
What if
there's a circle

02:34.790 --> 02:36.540
with no one
in the middle?
No.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.460
What if the spotlight
hits me just right?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.500
No!

02:40.500 --> 02:41.880
Fine!

02:41.880 --> 02:43.880
I won't dance!
Thank you.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.670
But just know --

02:45.670 --> 02:48.330
you have robbed
these kids of beauty.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.290
♪ Unh ♪

02:51.380 --> 02:52.210
Mm.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.750
Okay, date night!

02:55.750 --> 02:57.460
What do you
want to watch?

02:57.460 --> 02:58.830
What do you
want to watch?

02:58.830 --> 03:00.710
Let's say what we want
to watch at the same time.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.040
Both: "A Star is Born."

03:03.040 --> 03:04.960
Oh, God,
I love us.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.960
Listen, have you --
Hey, hey, hey!

03:08.960 --> 03:10.080
Make room for Jesus.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.710
Mm-hmm.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.880
Mnh-mnh!

03:14.880 --> 03:17.620
Jesus likes to stretch out.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.000
Uh-huh.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.670
Yeah, yeah,
well, that's more like it.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.710
And, Junior, have you seen
Devante's Bubbasnug?

03:25.710 --> 03:28.080
I'm asking 'cause
you're really the only one

03:28.080 --> 03:29.380
looking after that child.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.330
Bubbasnug?

03:30.330 --> 03:32.580
It's a blankie
and pacifier in one.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.040
Genius collab. He had it
when we were at the par--

03:36.460 --> 03:37.670
Oh, no.

03:37.670 --> 03:38.710
We must have left it there.

03:38.710 --> 03:39.830
He can't fall asleep
without it.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.500
Aw, poor little guy.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.330
It's his favorite thing
in the world.

03:43.330 --> 03:44.670
We have to go back
and look for it.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.330
Let me grab my stuff.
Okay.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.790
And then we can
get back to doing

03:47.790 --> 03:49.540
what we were doing.

03:49.540 --> 03:52.330
You better not get back
to doing what you were doing.

03:52.330 --> 03:55.500
Mm-hmm. 'Cause Black Jesus
sees you everywhere!

03:55.500 --> 03:56.920
Uh-huh.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.290
So my plan
was to lock down Jack

03:59.290 --> 04:01.380
and not embarrass Diane,

04:01.380 --> 04:03.040
as if I even could.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.710
Hello, Jack's dad.
Hello, Diane.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.500
You don't know me,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.290
and I don't know you.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.330
Yes, just continue
to lay low for me,

04:11.330 --> 04:13.080
or even leave.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.540
Whatever feels right.
Okay.

04:15.540 --> 04:16.670
She doesn't get it,

04:16.670 --> 04:19.290
but I bet you're glad
I'm here.

04:19.290 --> 04:21.580
Always happy to have
a parent help out.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.580
Yeah, well, but these other
parents aren't like me.

04:23.580 --> 04:26.670
I know the difference
between a flash drive

04:26.670 --> 04:29.000
and a
vape pen.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.040
Do you?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.710
Flash drive.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.960
This is the key
to my Civic, Mr. Johnson.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.710
Okay.

04:39.710 --> 04:42.170
Is that
a glitter bomb?
No,

04:42.170 --> 04:44.120
it's two
glitter bombs.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.080
So, what are
you boys doing?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.170
Nothing.

04:47.170 --> 04:49.670
Yeah, these are --

04:49.670 --> 04:51.710
are --
are dance s-sticks.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.000
Really?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.540
Give them to me.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.120
Give them to me.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.960
Ha! So you thought
you could pull one over on me?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.830
Please.

05:01.830 --> 05:05.250
I'm undefeated
against children.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.580

Mr. Johnson,

06:29.120 --> 06:31.880
I'm concerned about
your abilities as a chaperone.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.080
So am I.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.460
Mason: No one feels
like talking, huh?

06:44.460 --> 06:47.540
That's okay.
I'm totally fine with silence.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.960
Dr. Goldberg says I don't
have to narrate everything.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.380
Hey, did you hear

06:56.380 --> 06:57.790
that there were
some kids making out?

06:59.290 --> 07:01.750
I wonder if there's
some pictures of that.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.170
That'd be nice to see.

07:03.170 --> 07:04.920
Oh, but then again,

07:04.920 --> 07:07.120
I also think that
young lovers deserve privacy.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.460
Mason?
Mm-hmm?

07:10.460 --> 07:13.330
How about we,
uh, don't talk?

07:14.750 --> 07:15.330
You got it.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.250
Does this car
have air bags?

07:19.250 --> 07:20.830
Mason, I said
please don't talk!

07:24.080 --> 07:26.420
Hi!

07:26.420 --> 07:28.210
Dre: Go upstairs, and don't
come out until I figure out

07:28.210 --> 07:29.420
what to do
with both of you.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.830
Go!

07:30.830 --> 07:33.290
What happened?
Why are you back so soon,

07:33.290 --> 07:35.080
and why -- why do you
have pit stains?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.620
Did you dance?

07:36.620 --> 07:38.580
You know
who you married.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.040
I'm never
gonna dance again.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.500
Your son set off
a glitter bomb...

07:43.500 --> 07:46.670
...and your daughter --
your --

07:46.670 --> 07:48.620
your daughter,
she broke my heart.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.170
How?

07:53.830 --> 07:55.710
I saw her
kissing a boy!

07:55.710 --> 07:56.880
Oh!

07:56.880 --> 07:58.670
That is so exciting!

07:58.670 --> 08:00.750
Oh, my God!

08:00.750 --> 08:03.420
What a moment!
It's not a moment, Bow!

08:03.420 --> 08:05.250
It was gross.
Oh, come on.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.750
It was
a head-wobbling,

08:06.750 --> 08:09.170
open-mouth,
public slob down.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.960
How long
were you watching?

08:10.960 --> 08:14.080
Long enough.
I saw everything.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.960
Damn it! I should've
never got that LASIK.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.380
Dre,
Diane kissing a boy

08:18.380 --> 08:21.330
is normal
and healthy.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.380
We -- We should be
excited for her,

08:23.380 --> 08:24.580
not shaming her.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.460
That does not
even sound right, Bow!
What?

08:27.460 --> 08:30.250
Public kissing is
how a girl gets a reputation.
Oh, my God.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.580
And it's my job to make sure
she does not become "that girl."

08:33.580 --> 08:35.960
That kind of talk

08:35.960 --> 08:39.790
is going to make her feel
ashamed about her body

08:39.790 --> 08:44.210
and about kissing and
about natural exploration.

08:44.210 --> 08:47.170
Will you please
stop talking, Bow?
No, you stop
talking, Dre!

08:47.170 --> 08:50.040
I am gonna go
and reassure Diane

08:50.040 --> 08:53.580
about this exciting
and special night

08:53.580 --> 08:56.750
that you have made
very, very weird.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.960
Unbelievable.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.960
Diane,
Mommy's coming!

09:10.500 --> 09:12.830
I'm Devante.
I'm a toddler.

09:12.830 --> 09:15.920
The natural flow of the park
sends me in...

09:15.920 --> 09:17.080
this direction!

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
Come on, Bubbasnug.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.210
Ah, boom!

09:22.210 --> 09:23.420
Found it!
Really?

09:26.380 --> 09:29.250
No-- Oh, it's just
a gently used diaper.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.420
Okay, that's the third diaper
you've found.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.670
Can we just run
and get him a new pacifier?

09:34.670 --> 09:37.460
Pacifier?

09:37.460 --> 09:38.750
You think I've been
acting like a jerk

09:38.750 --> 09:40.920
for a pacifier?

09:40.920 --> 09:43.380
No, he needs
his Bubbasnug.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.920
You know
what we should do?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.460
Break into the Bubbasnug
factory...
Get in the car...

09:46.460 --> 09:47.830
...in Fontana.
...and go home.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.670
I thought we were
gonna say the same thing.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.420
Look, Junior,

09:52.420 --> 09:54.830
I haven't said anything,
but every date night,

09:54.830 --> 09:56.880
something like this
comes up.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.250
Last week, we missed
the burger pop-up

09:58.250 --> 10:00.210
because you had
to watch Devante.

10:00.210 --> 10:01.710
Dad had
Clipper tickets.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.380
Against Charlotte!

10:03.380 --> 10:05.330
He needed a night!
So do we!

10:05.330 --> 10:07.420
I blew off my friends
to hang out with you.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.380
I don't care about
this stupid Bubbasnug.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.960
Wow. That says it all.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.620
That says what?

10:13.620 --> 10:14.920
That you're like that.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.960
That I'm "like" what?

10:20.960 --> 10:23.250
Hi.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.960
Is Dad ever gonna
talk to me again?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.420
Of course he is.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.380
Your dad and I
are so excited for you.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.790
That's not true.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.710
He wouldn't look at me
the whole way home.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.620
Honey, look,
your dad is just hung up

10:36.620 --> 10:39.880
on the fact that he still
sees you as his little girl.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.460
But, sweetheart,

10:41.460 --> 10:45.290
what you did is completely
natural for a kid your age.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.540
Seriously.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.460
And I'm here so you can tell me
all about it, okay?

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
I'm your
sounding board.
Okay.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.040
So, what's his name?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.790
Jalen.
Jalen!

10:56.790 --> 10:58.330
What?

10:58.330 --> 11:00.710
He sounds so cute.
Is he cute?

11:00.710 --> 11:02.460
Yeah.
I knew it.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.080
I have never known
an ugly Jalen. What else?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.710
He's in eighth grade.
Okay.

11:06.710 --> 11:08.170
He's on the debate team.
That's how we met.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.620
So he's smart.
Mm-hmm.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.460
Nice. I love it.
What else?

11:11.460 --> 11:13.330
Well, he's the lead
in the spring musical.

11:13.330 --> 11:16.880
Show biz.
Okay, okay.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.000
So, how did
this whole thing unfold?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.620
Well, we met up
at the dance...
Okay.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.540
Hey, Diane.

11:24.540 --> 11:25.460
Hi.

11:25.460 --> 11:26.540
You look great.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.620
Thanks.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.920
You, too.
Yeah,
but you look better.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.420
...and...

11:35.420 --> 11:36.710
then we kissed.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.790
Oh, my God.

11:41.750 --> 11:45.250
Are you okay?
Yes, tell me more.

11:45.250 --> 11:49.380
So Bow was trying to get me
to see Diane in a new light,

11:49.380 --> 11:51.330
but I was struggling.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.380
It was my instinct
to protect my little girl,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.420
find out who this boy was,

11:56.420 --> 11:59.620
and how long
it had been going on.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.670
But maybe Bow was right.

12:02.670 --> 12:05.000
Nope. Bow was wrong.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.920
Who is the boy?!

12:06.920 --> 12:08.960
What is his name?!

12:08.960 --> 12:10.250
Uh-uh-uh,
I don't know!

12:10.250 --> 12:12.460
Uh-uh-uh, figure it out,
Glitter Bomber!

12:12.460 --> 12:16.670
You are staring at six months
hard no-screen time.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.080
I'm not rolling over
on my twin.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.080
So you're good with
not being able to upload

12:23.080 --> 12:26.040
your idiotic
challenge videos.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
th-that's my brand.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.750
Give...me...a...name!!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.380
Okay, okay, Jalen --

12:32.380 --> 12:33.460
Jalen Hunter!

12:33.460 --> 12:34.750
Good.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.790
Now, how long
has this been going on?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.750
Uh, I don't know,

12:40.750 --> 12:42.250
probably since
she and Ricky broke up.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.080
Ricky?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.580
There's another boy?!

12:46.580 --> 12:49.710
Oh, God.
I've said too much.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.880
Oh, she's gonna kill me and
make it look like an accident.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.170
Oh, you've got to tell her
I-I didn't break easy,

12:54.170 --> 12:56.460
pl--please --
Shut up!

12:56.460 --> 12:58.170
Eight months
no screen time now.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.290
We don't like snitches.

13:00.290 --> 13:01.500
What?

13:04.290 --> 13:05.710
Damn it, Jack.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.500
Well, excuse me for
being a Black man in America

13:08.500 --> 13:10.790
trying to do right
by a kid who's not my own.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.210
Exactly!
He's not your own.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.830
I didn't sign up
to date a single father.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.540
Didn't sign up
for this?

13:16.540 --> 13:17.960
Wow. It -- It feels like
you've had that one

13:17.960 --> 13:19.540
loaded up
for a while.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.290
You know what?

13:23.290 --> 13:25.000
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.330
This is so nice.
Mm-hmm.

13:36.330 --> 13:39.330
Just sitting here,
relating,

13:39.330 --> 13:41.000
being in
your safe space.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.500
Thanks, Mom.
Yeah.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.120
You know, all my friends
are jealous of me.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.960
Jealous of the bond
that we have.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.420
It's about honesty

13:49.420 --> 13:50.920
and keeping
that door open.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.750
Mm-hmm.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.540
What is that?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.170
Dad?!

13:57.170 --> 13:58.460
Dre, what are you
doing?!

13:58.460 --> 14:01.330
I'm doing what I need to do
to protect my daughter.

14:01.330 --> 14:02.460
And that means
no more privacy,

14:02.460 --> 14:04.750
because it's clearly
shown to me

14:04.750 --> 14:06.000
that you've had
too much of it!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.420
All she did
was kiss a boy.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.460
Oh, really?

14:10.460 --> 14:12.670
Did she tell you
about Ricky?

14:14.210 --> 14:16.210
Who's Ricky?
Sweetheart?

14:17.170 --> 14:20.000
Sweetie? Who --

14:20.000 --> 14:21.080
Who's Ricky?!

14:23.830 --> 14:26.040
He was a guy
I used to hang out with.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.580
Okay,
wait a minute.

14:29.580 --> 14:32.580
Did you
or did you not

14:32.580 --> 14:35.790
have your first kiss
with Jalen?

14:36.790 --> 14:38.080
I mean...

14:39.960 --> 14:42.000
I can't believe this!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.170
You let me believe

14:44.170 --> 14:47.210
that Jalen
was your first kiss!

14:47.210 --> 14:49.250
What else
are you not telling me?

14:49.250 --> 14:50.960
Mom, it's not
like that.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.500
So you didn't have a boyfriend
that you kept hidden from us?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.000
I mean...

14:55.000 --> 14:56.420
Oh, my God.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.880
I thought
we were connecting!

14:58.880 --> 15:00.790
I thought I was
your safe space!

15:00.790 --> 15:02.880
Hold my gun, Bow.
Hold my gun.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.830
Okay, Diane.
This is it!

15:04.830 --> 15:06.750
No more boys!

15:06.750 --> 15:08.790
No more privacy!

15:08.790 --> 15:10.790
You are living your life
out in the open.

15:10.790 --> 15:13.620
You are living
in piles now, young lady!

15:13.620 --> 15:15.330
Mom, are you really
going to let him do this?!

15:15.330 --> 15:17.830
Yes, I am!
And I am gonna get involved.

15:17.830 --> 15:19.120
No more safe spaces
for you.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.210
You give me
your phone.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.080
It's right there.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.920
Give me your burner.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.750
What's a burner?

15:26.750 --> 15:27.710
Don't insult me.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.750
Come on!

15:46.880 --> 15:49.080
I can't believe
it's come to this.
What?

15:49.080 --> 15:51.420
I don't want to go through
Diane's phone.

15:51.420 --> 15:53.380
W-Why did we never have
this problem with Zoey?

15:53.380 --> 15:55.790
That's because Zoey
never kissed a boy.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.000
You know Zoey's done
a lot more than kiss a boy.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.540
Mnh-mnh.
We had a huge fight
about it

15:59.540 --> 16:00.880
last year, Dre.
You know what?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.620
I blocked that
entire period from my memory.

16:03.620 --> 16:04.710
Of course you did.

16:04.710 --> 16:06.500
Lost a lot of things.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.210
Like, I can't remember
who won March Madness

16:08.210 --> 16:10.500
or Devante's first steps,
but you know what?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.380
It was worth it.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.000
Maybe it's because
Zoey always acted

16:16.000 --> 16:18.170
like she had everything
under control, you know?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.420
She -- Like,
she never needed my help,

16:20.420 --> 16:23.670
but Diane always comes to me
with this kind of stuff.

16:23.670 --> 16:25.250
Okay, baby, if she's not
gonna talk to you,

16:25.250 --> 16:26.580
maybe we should
just lock her down.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.790
What?
She is just
a little girl.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.620
Dre...
Is she?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.210
She's 13.

16:32.210 --> 16:35.380
When I was 13,
I was managing an Arby's.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.380
Yeah. We baby our kids
longer than we used to.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.750
The twins
are our babies.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.960
They were your babies.
That's your problem.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.790
You keep seeing them
for who they were,

16:45.790 --> 16:47.380
not for who they are.

16:47.380 --> 16:50.170
Now, they're in
separate rooms.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.920
Diane's had her period,

16:51.920 --> 16:54.000
and Jack has
a training mustache.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.880
You know what?
You're right.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.250
I know the kids
are getting older,

16:57.250 --> 16:59.580
and I'm okay with that.
I just --

16:59.580 --> 17:01.540
I just wish Diane

17:01.540 --> 17:04.250
wouldn't keep these kinds
of things from me.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.540
Oh, so when you were
her age,

17:06.540 --> 17:09.080
you told your mom about
all the boys you were with?

17:09.080 --> 17:11.250
Oh, no.
And you're still
close with her...

17:11.250 --> 17:13.250
Yeah.
...even though
she's terrible.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.380
Oh, my God.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.750
Look, I don't know
if I can keep her safe

17:17.750 --> 17:19.380
if she doesn't
tell us stuff.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.620
If y'all keep
acting all crazy,

17:21.620 --> 17:24.000
she's gonna
tell you less.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.580
Now, like it or not,
she's gonna have a door,

17:26.580 --> 17:28.500
and it's up to y'all

17:28.500 --> 17:31.000
whether it's the door
to her room

17:31.000 --> 17:32.920
or the door
to her heart.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.000
Okay?
Mm.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.120
What are you doing?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.540
Why are you reading?
Jack:

17:43.540 --> 17:45.120
Dad banned me
from screens,

17:45.120 --> 17:47.580
so I got into
Grandma's books.
Mm.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.830
Did you know that women
have rich inner lives?

17:49.830 --> 17:51.830
And a married man's
never gonna leave his wife?

17:51.830 --> 17:53.250
You know, Jack?

17:53.250 --> 17:55.040
I, too, have been
waiting to exhale.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.620
Niecy dumped me.
Hang on.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.580
Let me get into
real-talk position.

18:07.290 --> 18:08.120
You know,
I don't know what went --

18:12.250 --> 18:13.710
I don't know
what went wr--

18:16.710 --> 18:17.960
Proceed.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.250
I don't know
what went wrong, you know?

18:22.250 --> 18:24.380
I took her to the park
in the middle of the night,

18:24.380 --> 18:26.170
we hopped in the sand,
and I made her look

18:26.170 --> 18:28.620
for Devante's Bubbasnug
for two and a half hours.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.540
Mm.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.040
Huh, you know, now that
I put it all together,

18:33.040 --> 18:34.460
I was being
a little crazy.

18:35.830 --> 18:36.880
I'm gonna call her
and patch it up.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.290
No, no, no, no.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.290
You weren't being crazy.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.540
You were
just being Junior.

18:42.540 --> 18:45.210
Are you going to be
somebody else just for her?

18:46.710 --> 18:48.620
Look...

18:48.620 --> 18:50.880
when Gloria finally found
a man that accepted her

18:50.880 --> 18:54.420
for who she was,
she found happiness.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.080
That's what
I want for you.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.380
I want that for me.
Then what
you need to do

18:58.380 --> 18:59.620
is put that phone down

18:59.620 --> 19:01.000
and get into these books,
playboy.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.960
Knock, knock.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.290
That's what
it would sound like

19:09.290 --> 19:11.080
if I didn't
take your door off.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.380
Well, I'm not hiding
anything in this pile.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.170
I'm just trying to find
a shirt to sleep in.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.960
Baby girl, I'm sorry
I went a little nuts.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.540
Me, too.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.000
Just, we thought
we had more time.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.920
But you're --
you're a young woman now,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.830
and there's gonna be things
in your life

19:29.830 --> 19:31.790
that I'm not
a part of.

19:31.790 --> 19:33.210
Like kissing.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.330
Well...

19:34.330 --> 19:36.330
it wasn't kissing, babe.
Please focus.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.580
I can't get it
out of my mind.
That's not what
we're here to do. All right?

19:38.580 --> 19:40.040
Okay.
Okay. Sweetheart.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.540
We just need
open communication,

19:45.540 --> 19:47.380
and we can
accept that

19:47.380 --> 19:49.040
you're not gonna
tell us everything.

19:50.380 --> 19:51.830
But I really
want you to know

19:51.830 --> 19:54.210
that you can
tell us anything.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.420
Okay?
Okay.

19:57.420 --> 20:00.380
I hear you,
and I'll do better.
Okay.

20:00.380 --> 20:03.210
And I promise
I will talk to...Mom.

20:03.210 --> 20:05.330
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.710
That's definitely
the better way to go.
Works for me.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.710
Mm-hmm.

20:09.710 --> 20:12.000
You know, I think
I was actually

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
mad at you
for growing up.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.460
That's not your fault.
I can't stop time, baby girl.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.580
I'm sorry.
I love you.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.710
Okay?

20:21.710 --> 20:23.210
Okay.
Mm.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.460
And here's
your phone.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.750
Jalen texted you
four times...

20:28.750 --> 20:31.460
Oh!
...to see
if you're okay.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.420
He might be
a keeper.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.920
Okay. And since you're
old enough to kiss a boy,

20:35.920 --> 20:38.710
you are old enough

20:38.710 --> 20:40.210
to put your door
back on yourself.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.380
I've done it before.
It's fine.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.040
Yeah, I'll get
the drill for you.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.500
You know how to put
a door on?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.790
Mm-hmm.
Where'd
you learn that?

20:58.460 --> 21:00.000
I was wrong, Dre!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.250
You should have danced!

21:01.250 --> 21:04.880
You should always dance!

21:11.960 --> 21:13.830
Aah!

21:16.210 --> 21:18.040
What you have
to ask yourself...

21:19.120 --> 21:21.040
...is this your dream

21:21.040 --> 21:22.040
or mine?
