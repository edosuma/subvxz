04:15.789 --> 04:17.789
         Rest a moment.         

04:30.237 --> 04:31.470
             What.              

05:17.084 --> 05:17.916
            Others.             

05:18.452 --> 05:19.318
      Go back to sleep.         

05:42.609 --> 05:44.509
          Breakfast.            

05:48.382 --> 05:50.515
    She would eat you alive.    

06:49.510 --> 06:51.009
          Years ago.            

06:52.045 --> 06:53.412
     I stood exactly            
     where you stand now.       

06:54.381 --> 06:56.348
 Waiting to go into this forest 

06:57.451 --> 06:58.583
     and see whether I          
     would come out a man       

06:59.286 --> 07:00.619
 or if I would come out at all. 

07:02.289 --> 07:04.523
    I can not tell you what     
    will happen tonight.        

07:05.392 --> 07:07.292
      No two trials are         
      exactly the same.         

07:09.029 --> 07:10.695
      Once this is over.        

07:11.732 --> 07:14.599
     One of you will            
     come out in my place       

07:15.402 --> 07:17.602
    and I will remain here      
    for the rest of my days.    

07:21.475 --> 07:25.610
  I want you to remember        
  simply being chosen leader    
  doesn't make you one.         

07:26.146 --> 07:26.812
     You have to earn it.       

07:26.814 --> 07:30.048
 As I hope I have in my time.   

07:32.019 --> 07:33.618
      Use your training.        

07:34.188 --> 07:35.353
         Stay focused.          

07:35.889 --> 07:37.656
     Do your parents proud.     

07:38.325 --> 07:40.292
     Good luck with that.       

07:42.062 --> 07:46.231
 There is one more rule we must 
 all agree on before we begin.  

07:48.435 --> 07:50.235
 Whatever happens once we enter 

07:50.938 --> 07:51.837
 whatever decisions are made    

07:51.839 --> 07:52.671
    whatever events we face.    

07:52.672 --> 07:53.504
 whatever decisions are made    

07:54.441 --> 07:56.975
Once it is over, they stay here.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.246
  You will not speak of it      
  again and you will not        
  take it back to the tribe.    

08:01.248 --> 08:02.247
         Understood?            

08:02.248 --> 08:03.247
  You will not speak of it      
  again and you will not        
  take it back to the tribe.    

08:13.060 --> 08:15.594
        Then the best of        
        luck to you all.        

09:34.508 --> 09:36.641
     He's going this way.       

09:42.449 --> 09:43.114
             Well?              

09:43.116 --> 09:43.465
          It's him.             

09:43.466 --> 09:43.815
             Well?              

09:44.851 --> 09:46.318
     We should go in the        
     other direction.           

09:46.320 --> 09:46.702
             Why?               

09:46.703 --> 09:47.085
     We should go in the        
     other direction.           

09:47.955 --> 09:49.187
         Too obvious.           

09:50.290 --> 09:51.323
      Why would Nus want        
      us to get lost?           

09:51.692 --> 09:52.657
          No Thade.             

09:52.659 --> 09:55.927
It's dark and I don't want to   
get lost out here for the night.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.495
            Do you?             

10:01.568 --> 10:02.834
     I'm going this way.        

10:02.836 --> 10:04.069
  You two do what you want.     

10:04.070 --> 10:05.303
     I'm going this way.        

10:08.408 --> 10:09.841
         Go on then.            

10:09.843 --> 10:10.892
     Follow your boyfriend.     

10:10.893 --> 10:11.942
         Go on then.            

10:13.747 --> 10:16.615
            Wahhhh.             

10:39.606 --> 10:41.373
            Wahhhhh!            

10:56.423 --> 10:58.623
      Looks like it just        
      between us now.           

10:58.625 --> 10:59.591
 We're not leaving him here.    

10:59.592 --> 11:00.558
      Looks like it just        
      between us now.           

11:01.294 --> 11:02.227
  Help me get him off this.     

11:02.696 --> 11:03.495
             Why?               

11:04.464 --> 11:07.799
     Why? Because I             
     said so that's why.        

11:07.801 --> 11:09.217
      Eiren you should          
      watch your temper.        

11:09.218 --> 11:10.634
     Why? Because I             
     said so that's why.        

11:10.637 --> 11:11.686
     What would Nus think?      

11:11.687 --> 11:12.736
     Why? Because I             
     said so that's why.        

11:13.440 --> 11:15.173
  You are going to help me.     

11:16.910 --> 11:18.777
         Is that so?            

11:20.914 --> 11:23.281
 That's what I like about you.  

11:23.817 --> 11:25.550
     A girl of few words.       

11:25.552 --> 11:26.301
         Please Ares.           

11:26.302 --> 11:27.051
     A girl of few words.       

11:27.654 --> 11:28.753
          It hurts.             

11:29.423 --> 11:30.455
             Arrrgh             

11:30.824 --> 11:31.589
         arrrghhh!!!            

11:31.591 --> 11:32.340
      Bit down on this.         

11:32.341 --> 11:33.090
         arrrghhh!!!            

11:33.994 --> 11:35.860
          On three.             

11:36.596 --> 11:37.595
             One.               

11:37.597 --> 11:38.079
             Two                

11:38.080 --> 11:38.562
             One.               

11:38.565 --> 11:39.331
      Wait, wait, wait.         

11:39.332 --> 11:40.098
             One.               

11:40.567 --> 11:41.933
             What?              

11:41.935 --> 11:43.001
 Are you sure you just don't    
 want to leave him here?        

11:43.002 --> 11:44.068
             What?              

11:45.672 --> 11:46.871
             One.               

11:47.340 --> 11:48.640
             Two.               

11:49.409 --> 11:50.041
             Three.             

11:50.677 --> 11:52.610
          Arrrghh!!!            

11:55.182 --> 11:56.147
             Well               

11:56.149 --> 11:57.015
 ill see you two later then.    

11:57.016 --> 11:57.882
             Well               

11:58.351 --> 11:58.817
             Huh?               

11:58.819 --> 12:00.719
        Don't you dare.         

12:01.188 --> 12:02.520
             What?              

12:02.522 --> 12:03.738
    I'm not staying out         
    here with this cripple.     

12:03.739 --> 12:04.955
             What?              

12:06.359 --> 12:07.826
Every animal for thirty miles   
is going to smell him bleeding. 

12:08.295 --> 12:09.260
             Ares.              

12:10.630 --> 12:13.131
 No offence but you were always 
 going to be a dead weight.     

12:14.034 --> 12:16.301
     What do you say Eiren?     

12:16.303 --> 12:16.952
 I'll give you a head start.    

12:16.953 --> 12:17.602
     What do you say Eiren?     

12:17.604 --> 12:18.687
      Let's finish this         
      just me and you.          

12:18.688 --> 12:19.771
     What do you say Eiren?     

12:21.508 --> 12:24.709
     Or how about I slit        
     your throat now            

12:24.711 --> 12:25.710
    and leave you both here.    

12:25.711 --> 12:26.710
     Or how about I slit        
     your throat now            

12:26.713 --> 12:27.662
     How does that sound?       

12:27.663 --> 12:28.612
     Or how about I slit        
     your throat now            

12:28.615 --> 12:29.130
             Eiren?             

12:29.131 --> 12:29.646
     Or how about I slit        
     your throat now            

12:30.383 --> 12:31.783
          Nice try?             

12:32.819 --> 12:35.120
     But you literally          
     don't have the balls.      

12:36.490 --> 12:38.123
     I'll leave you to it.      

12:38.558 --> 12:39.157
             Ohh                

12:39.159 --> 12:41.493
    And if you see me again.    

12:41.495 --> 12:42.894
  You will be kneeling at my    
  feet as your new leader.      

12:42.895 --> 12:44.294
    And if you see me again.    

12:44.297 --> 12:45.363
     What a nice thought.       

12:45.364 --> 12:46.430
    And if you see me again.    

13:48.461 --> 13:49.928
            Get off.            

13:52.699 --> 13:54.399
     Why are we stopping?       

13:55.702 --> 13:57.268
 I've been dragging you         
 through this forest for hours  

13:57.270 --> 13:58.336
    and your armpit smells.     

13:58.337 --> 13:59.403
 I've been dragging you         
 through this forest for hours  

14:05.779 --> 14:07.912
        Rest for a while        

14:09.649 --> 14:13.718
 Ares is probably leader        
 by now so there's no point     
 killing ourselves for nothing. 

14:15.889 --> 14:17.589
     Are we climbing up?        

14:17.591 --> 14:18.156
          The tree?             

14:18.157 --> 14:18.722
     Are we climbing up?        

14:18.725 --> 14:19.724
        Don't be stupid.        

14:19.725 --> 14:20.724
     Are we climbing up?        

14:20.727 --> 14:21.726
    What are you looking at?    

14:21.727 --> 14:22.726
     Are we climbing up?        

14:22.729 --> 14:23.561
         Not looking.           

14:23.562 --> 14:24.394
     Are we climbing up?        

14:24.397 --> 14:25.463
          Listening.            

14:25.464 --> 14:26.530
     Are we climbing up?        

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
            Arghhh..            

14:31.738 --> 14:34.739
Maybe we should rest over there.

15:02.035 --> 15:06.404
 Congratulations Ares,          
 you've made it to the birth    
 place of our first leader.     

15:07.274 --> 15:08.973
        It is an honour.        

15:15.148 --> 15:17.682
        Eiren and Thade?        

15:21.855 --> 15:24.789
 Thade stood on a bear trap.    

15:24.791 --> 15:25.473
     Eiren stayed with him.     

15:25.474 --> 15:26.156
 Thade stood on a bear trap.    

15:26.159 --> 15:27.125
        And you didn't?         

15:27.126 --> 15:28.092
 Thade stood on a bear trap.    

15:29.963 --> 15:31.429
             No.                

15:36.636 --> 15:39.771
  Then we best call out         
  for them don't you think?     

16:12.672 --> 16:14.806
 Why are you always so uptight? 

16:17.243 --> 16:19.377
        i'm just saying         

16:21.181 --> 16:24.983
 Nus would definitely choose    
 you if you would just          
 relax every now and then.      

16:25.618 --> 16:27.085
        I'm not a leader        

16:27.887 --> 16:31.522
     and Nus couldn't pick      
     me even if I were.         

16:32.559 --> 16:34.025
     People would get           
     over it eventually.        

16:34.027 --> 16:34.776
          Yeah right            

16:34.777 --> 16:35.526
     People would get           
     over it eventually.        

16:35.528 --> 16:36.844
     an orphan as leader?       

16:36.845 --> 16:38.161
     People would get           
     over it eventually.        

16:39.532 --> 16:42.600
 Then why spend the last        
 eight years trying so hard?    

16:43.303 --> 16:45.036
 What else was I going to do?   

16:47.273 --> 16:49.040
             Right.             

16:50.477 --> 16:52.243
          Of course.            

16:54.114 --> 16:55.380
    They'd be proud of you.     

16:55.382 --> 16:55.964
            Shut up.            

16:55.965 --> 16:56.547
    They'd be proud of you.     

16:56.916 --> 16:57.882
        i'm just saying.        

16:58.251 --> 16:59.884
         Shut up Thade.         

17:02.655 --> 17:03.888
             Where?             

17:03.890 --> 17:04.589
         It's coming.           

17:04.589 --> 17:05.289
             Where?             

17:32.085 --> 17:33.284
             Weird.             

17:34.087 --> 17:35.586
             Weird.             

17:41.795 --> 17:43.061
         (HORN SOUND)           

17:43.797 --> 17:45.029
          It's them.            

17:45.031 --> 17:45.597
            Get up.             

17:45.598 --> 17:46.164
          It's them.            

17:49.135 --> 17:51.135
Why are they calling out for us?

17:51.137 --> 17:52.053
      I though it was           
      against the rules.        

17:52.054 --> 17:52.970
Why are they calling out for us?

17:52.972 --> 17:53.938
         I don't know.          

17:53.939 --> 17:54.905
Why are they calling out for us?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.991
    Save your energy Areas.     

18:13.993 --> 18:14.575
        It's been hours.        

18:14.576 --> 18:15.158
    Save your energy Areas.     

18:15.161 --> 18:15.660
     Why we still waiting.      

18:15.661 --> 18:16.160
    Save your energy Areas.     

18:16.162 --> 18:17.228
        Why wouldn't we         
        wait?                   

18:17.229 --> 18:18.295
    Save your energy Areas.     

18:19.833 --> 18:20.965
             Ahh,               

18:23.670 --> 18:28.506
 because you think finding      
 this place makes you worthy    
 of being the next leader?      

18:29.209 --> 18:31.309
We haven't even started yet boy.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.918
         Are you ok?            

19:15.054 --> 19:16.921
 So you didn't get eaten then?  

19:17.957 --> 19:19.357
             Eiren              

19:27.100 --> 19:28.699
         Tell me Aries          

19:30.069 --> 19:31.802
 why exactly didn't you stay    
 to help one of your own?       

19:31.804 --> 19:32.303
             I..                

19:32.304 --> 19:32.803
 why exactly didn't you stay    
 to help one of your own?       

19:32.804 --> 19:33.303
         He's a coward.         

19:33.306 --> 19:34.422
 I was asking him and not you.  

19:34.423 --> 19:35.539
         He's a coward.         

19:40.079 --> 19:42.079
     Because he is a fool.      

19:42.081 --> 19:43.014
     He would have gotten       
     us all killed.             

19:43.015 --> 19:43.948
     Because he is a fool.      

19:45.051 --> 19:47.051
    You should be willing       
    to die for your people.     

19:47.053 --> 19:47.635
            And you.            

19:47.636 --> 19:48.218
    You should be willing       
    to die for your people.     

19:48.988 --> 19:50.288
      Whats your excuse?        

19:51.424 --> 19:52.456
         I saved him.           

19:52.458 --> 19:53.124
         Ares is right.         

19:53.125 --> 19:53.791
         I saved him.           

19:53.793 --> 19:54.942
     You could have gotten      
     the hole group killed.     

19:54.943 --> 19:56.092
         I saved him.           

19:56.095 --> 19:57.745
 You act without thinking,      
 that makes you as bad as Ares. 

19:57.746 --> 19:59.396
         I saved him.           

19:59.832 --> 20:01.065
            And you.            

20:01.267 --> 20:03.434
             You                

20:04.237 --> 20:05.703
      you are an idiot.         

20:08.441 --> 20:12.276
     So this is the             
     pick of the litter.        

20:14.447 --> 20:16.714
  Then we might as we begin.    

20:24.824 --> 20:27.225
      Our ancestors came        
      from this forest          

20:28.161 --> 20:29.760
  survivors of the old world    

20:29.762 --> 20:31.095
      who were already          
      here when it fell.        

20:31.096 --> 20:32.429
  survivors of the old world    

20:33.766 --> 20:36.634
    The story goes that the     
    tribe argued over what      
    they should do next         

20:37.370 --> 20:39.670
  and split into two groups.    

20:40.840 --> 20:43.007
      One went in search        
      of the old world.         

20:43.009 --> 20:45.576
    The other group stayed      
    and built the village       
    in which you now stands.    

20:45.577 --> 20:48.144
      One went in search        
      of the old world.         

20:49.115 --> 20:51.849
 They were happy for a time.    

20:52.285 --> 20:53.251
         But one night.         

20:54.220 --> 20:55.319
 While a fire burnt brightly.   

20:55.989 --> 20:57.355
     The others returned.       

20:59.058 --> 21:03.327
     Our men fought bravely     
     but slowly they were       
     butchered one by one.      

21:05.164 --> 21:08.966
     Until only the             
     young boy's remains.       

21:09.502 --> 21:11.035
      One of those boy's        

21:12.138 --> 21:15.439
     Samuel, had always had     
     a talent for hiding.       

21:17.310 --> 21:19.810
  Took what was left of our     
  village and taught them       
  to blend into the trees       

21:20.346 --> 21:22.046
     and hide in the forest     

21:23.149 --> 21:25.449
      until the others          
      gave up and left.         

21:26.052 --> 21:28.019
         As dawn broke.         

21:29.889 --> 21:33.291
  Samuel led what was left      
  of our people out of the      
  forest and to our new home    

21:33.726 --> 21:35.359
            Varosha.            

21:35.828 --> 21:37.895
        No longer a boy.        

21:37.897 --> 21:38.963
         But a leader.          

21:38.964 --> 21:40.030
        No longer a boy.        

21:41.267 --> 21:42.533
            Tonight.            

21:43.269 --> 21:45.970
You will make the same journey. 

21:46.539 --> 21:48.272
     Once this fire is lit.     

21:48.274 --> 21:49.590
 Anything could come out of the 
 trees.                         

21:49.591 --> 21:50.907
     Once this fire is lit.     

21:50.910 --> 21:52.243
      Or perhaps nothing        
      will come at all.         

21:52.244 --> 21:53.577
     Once this fire is lit.     

21:55.281 --> 21:57.214
    Every trial is different    

21:57.216 --> 21:58.783
  and every group deals with    
  the challenge differently.    

21:58.784 --> 22:00.351
    Every trial is different    

22:01.554 --> 22:03.821
        But in the end.         

22:04.190 --> 22:05.289
          One of you            

22:05.291 --> 22:06.808
 will emerge the new leader.    

22:06.809 --> 22:08.326
          One of you            

22:18.204 --> 22:21.205
        Light the fire.         

22:25.545 --> 22:28.279
        Well go on then.        

22:38.224 --> 22:39.824
     This is a man's honour     

22:39.826 --> 22:40.425
             Right?             

22:40.426 --> 22:41.025
     This is a man's honour     

22:41.394 --> 22:42.393
         That is right.         

23:13.359 --> 23:13.858
          Now what?             

23:13.860 --> 23:14.459
            We wait.            

23:14.460 --> 23:15.059
          Now what?             

23:15.595 --> 23:16.927
             Great.             

23:17.296 --> 23:19.964
         More waiting.          

23:39.285 --> 23:44.422
 Some things never change.      
 You're still sitting on your   
 own all the time, I see.       

23:46.292 --> 23:47.958
        I'm used to it.         

23:49.962 --> 23:52.997
    You know... I've always     
    seen myself as a father     
    to the whole tribe, but     
    some more than others.      

23:54.500 --> 23:56.634
         I am grateful.         

23:58.070 --> 24:01.138
     Your father would be       
     proud to see, that you     
     have made it this far.     

24:02.542 --> 24:06.377
    It feels right, that I      
    should end up going out     
    the same way he did.        

24:06.379 --> 24:08.946
  I had to watch your father    
  die in this place. I would    
  rather I didn't have to go    
  through the same with you.    

24:08.947 --> 24:11.514
    It feels right, that I      
    should end up going out     
    the same way he did.        

24:15.354 --> 24:17.555
 You should watch Ares tonight. 

24:18.858 --> 24:23.394
Just as you remind me of your   
father, so he reminds me of his.

24:26.232 --> 24:27.598
      Was it his father         
      that killed mine?         

24:27.600 --> 24:28.666
  You know I can't tell you.    

24:28.667 --> 24:29.733
      Was it his father         
      that killed mine?         

24:31.204 --> 24:33.070
  Why do you always have to     
  be so righteous with me...    

24:33.072 --> 24:34.822
  And why do you always have    
  to be so bad tempered?        

24:34.823 --> 24:36.573
  Why do you always have to     
  be so righteous with me...    

24:38.411 --> 24:40.578
  This would be an easy         
  competition, if you would     
  just get over yourself.       

24:43.549 --> 24:44.849
     You're not my father.      

24:47.086 --> 24:47.735
     And you're no leader.      

24:47.736 --> 24:48.385
        Not yet anyway.         

24:57.597 --> 24:59.864
  Doesn't that piss you off?    

25:01.434 --> 25:02.066
             What?              

25:02.068 --> 25:02.500
             Nus.               

25:02.501 --> 25:02.933
             What?              

25:04.370 --> 25:05.236
         Treating that          

25:05.771 --> 25:06.670
      differently to us.        

25:08.241 --> 25:10.007
  He practically raised her     

25:14.614 --> 25:16.747
 She shouldn't even be here.    

25:17.817 --> 25:19.783
      Who's legacy does         
      she even carry?           

25:20.786 --> 25:23.621
All her family are already dead.

25:27.426 --> 25:29.560
 Nus's decision is final Ares.  

25:30.429 --> 25:32.563
     If he chooses Eiren        

25:33.900 --> 25:35.699
         Tough shit.            

25:36.903 --> 25:38.569
          We'll see.            

25:41.474 --> 25:42.940
      I like her anyway.        

25:43.576 --> 25:45.142
         Nus was right.         

25:45.511 --> 25:47.645
        You are an idiot        

25:48.180 --> 25:48.746
     Where are you going?       

27:15.835 --> 27:17.067
            Please.             

27:17.603 --> 27:18.736
            Help me.            

27:25.411 --> 27:26.343
             Ares.              

27:26.612 --> 27:27.711
             What?              

27:30.616 --> 27:31.982
            Others.             

27:33.619 --> 27:36.754
 Then your trial has arrived.   

27:53.305 --> 27:55.673
     Please, their coming.      

28:00.746 --> 28:02.413
         Who is coming?         

28:18.330 --> 28:19.563
         Who is coming?         

28:21.667 --> 28:22.700
             Gods.              

28:31.510 --> 28:33.444
 Give us the girl and the box.  

28:36.582 --> 28:39.216
     We don't carry about       
     the rest of you.           

28:39.585 --> 28:40.384
         You can go.            

28:42.121 --> 28:42.920
         I'll do it.            

28:43.489 --> 28:44.488
            I swear             

29:00.372 --> 29:01.405
            Please.             

29:02.508 --> 29:03.407
     You have to help me        
     get rid of this box.       

29:43.048 --> 29:44.148
             Dead?              

29:57.830 --> 29:58.962
             Ares.              

29:59.165 --> 29:59.797
             What?              

30:00.566 --> 30:01.465
      I'm just looking.         

30:02.101 --> 30:03.400
        It's dangerous.         

30:08.040 --> 30:08.839
             So?                

30:10.576 --> 30:11.408
             Child.             

30:12.845 --> 30:15.712
  I don't think we should       
  be messing with that Ares.    

30:19.718 --> 30:21.051
     Thade is right Ares.       

30:21.053 --> 30:21.535
        Leave it alone.         

30:21.536 --> 30:22.018
     Thade is right Ares.       

30:22.621 --> 30:23.187
         Why should I?          

30:26.926 --> 30:29.226
      What did you say?         

30:31.797 --> 30:34.064
  This is a trail, correct?     

30:35.968 --> 30:39.002
      So it is up to us,        
      that is the rules.        

30:39.738 --> 30:42.506
     Your job, is to watch.     

30:43.876 --> 30:46.043
  Decide who you think          
  should be the next leader.    

30:46.912 --> 30:49.713
      And you think I           
      might choose you?         

30:50.916 --> 30:51.582
             No.                

30:51.584 --> 30:53.684
    I would not dream of it.    

30:54.920 --> 30:57.054
  You have already earmarked    
  your princess over there.     

30:57.890 --> 30:58.455
      With that honour.         

31:01.126 --> 31:02.593
          Very well.            

31:04.096 --> 31:07.030
 You decide what you do next.   

31:07.566 --> 31:10.133
    But together as a group.    

31:10.836 --> 31:13.737
If you want to be a leader Ares.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.273
 You have to prove yourself.    

31:16.909 --> 31:17.908
             Thade.             

31:18.344 --> 31:19.643
         You go first.          

31:22.481 --> 31:25.115
 I think we should give         
 them the girl and that box.    

31:26.185 --> 31:27.784
     Why should we get          
     involved with this?        

31:28.821 --> 31:31.688
     What if they decide        
     to come back.              

31:31.690 --> 31:32.756
        And kill us all.        

31:32.757 --> 31:33.823
     What if they decide        
     to come back.              

31:34.526 --> 31:36.460
After they have whatever it is. 

31:37.830 --> 31:40.797
     Well then we go            
     before they come back.     

31:41.500 --> 31:43.400
Leave the girl and the box here.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.937
 Maybe I should have left you   
 stuck in that trap earlier.    

31:46.939 --> 31:49.006
 How does waiting here to       
 die because of a box we know   
 nothing about make any sense?  

31:49.007 --> 31:51.074
 Maybe I should have left you   
 stuck in that trap earlier.    

31:53.812 --> 31:55.812
     Maybe those others.        

31:56.548 --> 31:57.981
  Are watching us right now.    

31:59.318 --> 32:02.085
    As soon as we leave         
    they will take the box.     

32:03.055 --> 32:04.855
 And follow us back to Varosha  

32:04.857 --> 32:05.506
    And kill the hole tribe.    

32:05.507 --> 32:06.156
 And follow us back to Varosha  

32:06.158 --> 32:07.091
 Well then what do you suggest? 

32:07.092 --> 32:08.025
 And follow us back to Varosha  

32:12.965 --> 32:15.098
        We keep the box.        

32:15.901 --> 32:17.434
         It is power.           

32:19.238 --> 32:21.104
     They are afraid of it.     

32:21.840 --> 32:23.941
     It is the only             
     reason they ran off.       

32:25.344 --> 32:27.844
  And it is the only reason     
  why we aren't dead yet.       

32:28.380 --> 32:30.180
     And what about her?        

32:33.986 --> 32:35.852
 She shows us how it use it.    

32:36.388 --> 32:37.354
     Otherwise we kill her.     

32:39.024 --> 32:42.726
 And you think this is the type 
 of leader I should choose?     

32:43.095 --> 32:44.294
         Tell me Ares.          

32:45.931 --> 32:48.298
  After you have discovered     
  what to do with               
  whatever is in the box        

32:49.001 --> 32:50.834
     What will you do next?     

32:52.104 --> 32:55.072
     Perhaps you will think     
     yourself a god too.        

32:56.775 --> 33:00.077
     you would prefer we        
     spend the rest of our      
     live answering to her.     

33:00.746 --> 33:01.745
         The orphan.            

33:02.348 --> 33:04.081
    You speak of tradition.     

33:04.616 --> 33:05.649
            But yet.            

33:06.719 --> 33:09.486
     You make the tribe         
     pet our new leader.        

33:10.589 --> 33:12.155
      She is a disaster         
      waiting to happen.        

33:12.524 --> 33:13.924
        And you know it.        

33:15.260 --> 33:16.159
             Eiren              

33:21.033 --> 33:22.499
     There she goes again.      

33:23.902 --> 33:26.703
 Just doing whatever she wants  
 without asking anybody else.   

33:28.607 --> 33:30.674
  I was bored of your voice.    

33:33.145 --> 33:35.112
          Arrrghhh!             

33:35.748 --> 33:36.947
         Wahhhhh!!!!            

33:44.590 --> 33:46.857
    First we find out more.     

33:48.494 --> 33:50.260
  Then we decide what to do.    

33:51.096 --> 33:51.595
             See.               

33:52.297 --> 33:54.031
      You are ignorant.         

33:54.733 --> 33:57.134
  Just like your father was.    

34:04.777 --> 34:05.809
         Where is it?           

34:06.178 --> 34:07.411
         Where is it?           

34:07.946 --> 34:09.146
      Give her the box.         

34:11.116 --> 34:11.782
             Now.               

34:27.433 --> 34:28.732
         Who are you?           

34:32.304 --> 34:33.235
             Drink.             

34:45.350 --> 34:46.616
         Not all of it.         

34:48.286 --> 34:49.319
             Sorry.             

34:53.659 --> 34:54.690
             Eiren.             

34:55.159 --> 34:55.759
             You?               

34:57.296 --> 34:58.161
             Flynn.             

34:58.997 --> 34:59.796
         Who are you?           

34:59.798 --> 35:00.314
     Where are you from?        

35:00.315 --> 35:00.831
         Who are you?           

35:00.833 --> 35:01.498
 Why do you want to know that?  

35:01.499 --> 35:02.164
         Who are you?           

35:09.475 --> 35:11.942
That's not important right now. 

35:15.848 --> 35:18.615
    Who were those men          
    that followed you here?     

35:19.384 --> 35:21.151
     Three, Six and Nine.       

35:22.187 --> 35:23.854
     Named after the            
     numbers on the box.        

35:23.856 --> 35:24.938
         They are gods?         

35:24.939 --> 35:26.021
     Named after the            
     numbers on the box.        

35:27.092 --> 35:28.792
     That's what they say.      

35:30.996 --> 35:33.230
 Because of what is in the box. 

35:34.032 --> 35:35.332
         What is it?            

35:36.535 --> 35:38.235
     My people worship it.      

35:39.338 --> 35:41.338
      Whoever has the           
      box rule the city.        

35:41.874 --> 35:42.739
    Who are the masked men?     

35:43.442 --> 35:44.975
  They are the chosen ones.     

35:45.511 --> 35:47.043
     Guardians of the box.      

35:48.013 --> 35:50.580
     I'm going to get rid       
     of it forever tho.         

35:51.116 --> 35:52.182
      You could help me.        

35:53.252 --> 35:54.251
             Why?               

35:55.053 --> 35:56.319
            Please.             

35:57.122 --> 35:58.922
      My parents died           
      to still this box.        

35:59.458 --> 36:01.191
     I have to finish it.       

36:01.627 --> 36:02.325
             How?               

36:02.928 --> 36:03.760
          No Eiren.             

36:03.762 --> 36:04.011
     You are not in charge.     

36:04.012 --> 36:04.261
          No Eiren.             

36:04.897 --> 36:05.662
         Eiren please.          

36:06.865 --> 36:07.697
             How?               

36:09.868 --> 36:11.334
        There's a lake.         

36:12.037 --> 36:13.537
 On other side of the forest.   

36:14.239 --> 36:15.572
 At the edge of the old world.  

36:16.642 --> 36:17.908
      It's where the box        
      first came from.          

36:18.977 --> 36:20.844
     I'm going to throw it      
     deep into the watch.       

36:21.380 --> 36:22.546
     This is a bad idea.        

36:23.081 --> 36:24.281
     This is your trial.        

36:25.117 --> 36:27.083
    This is your discussion.    

36:27.619 --> 36:28.752
      This is ball shit.        

36:29.288 --> 36:30.520
     You heard the woman.       

36:31.623 --> 36:33.423
 She comes from a great city.   

36:34.126 --> 36:36.259
 They know that we exist now.   

36:37.262 --> 36:38.528
        We need to box.         

36:39.598 --> 36:42.098
    It is the only reason       
    why they will stay away.    

36:42.100 --> 36:43.283
 The box is the only reason     
 why they will try and find us. 

36:43.284 --> 36:44.467
    It is the only reason       
    why they will stay away.    

36:45.270 --> 36:46.169
     We need to leave now.      

36:46.171 --> 36:46.803
 And forget we ever saw this.   

36:46.804 --> 36:47.436
     We need to leave now.      

36:48.974 --> 36:50.941
    And how long do you         
    think you would last        
    with your leg like that?    

36:51.977 --> 36:53.577
     You need the box           
     more than any of us.       

36:56.315 --> 36:58.682
      You left him in           
      the first earlier.        

36:58.684 --> 36:59.683
        And now you care        
        all of a sudden.        

36:59.684 --> 37:00.683
      You left him in           
      the first earlier.        

37:00.686 --> 37:01.268
         Shut up Eiren.         

37:01.269 --> 37:01.851
      You left him in           
      the first earlier.        

37:01.853 --> 37:02.235
            Or what?            

37:02.236 --> 37:02.618
      You left him in           
      the first earlier.        

37:03.088 --> 37:03.620
             Quite.             

37:04.256 --> 37:04.821
         Both of you.           

37:05.290 --> 37:05.755
             What?              

37:06.758 --> 37:07.991
         Their back.            

37:16.301 --> 37:17.434
          Eeeekkkk!             

37:22.140 --> 37:23.139
         Open the box.          

37:24.042 --> 37:25.175
         Open the box.          

37:32.150 --> 37:32.983
            Give it.            

37:41.560 --> 37:42.759
        We need to hide.        

37:45.163 --> 37:46.029
             Eiren.             

38:04.883 --> 38:06.316
          Arrrghhh!             

38:10.656 --> 38:11.488
             BANG!              

38:12.190 --> 38:13.990
  Go, go now. This is mine.     

38:43.188 --> 38:44.254
             Thade.             

38:57.202 --> 38:57.934
             You.               

38:59.037 --> 39:01.838
    Are a lot harder to kill    
    than your father was.       

39:02.374 --> 39:04.407
     he cried like a dog.       

39:05.744 --> 39:07.077
         Very amusing.          

39:08.313 --> 39:10.580
          Arrrghhh!             

39:14.252 --> 39:17.253
     And you taste better       
     than he did too.           

39:32.404 --> 39:33.403
             BANG!              

39:50.589 --> 39:51.654
          Arrrghhh.             

40:13.145 --> 40:14.511
     Open your eye's Nus        

40:19.050 --> 40:20.583
          Don't die             

40:21.186 --> 40:21.684
          Not here.             

40:22.154 --> 40:22.952
            Bosses.             

40:35.967 --> 40:37.534
        Human after all.        

41:04.663 --> 41:05.895
        Your not ready.         

41:07.933 --> 41:09.499
        None of you are.        

41:39.865 --> 41:41.664
         From death.            

41:42.200 --> 41:43.833
     We are able to live.       

42:27.279 --> 42:28.611
     What does this mean?       

42:30.682 --> 42:31.948
         I don't know.          

42:32.651 --> 42:33.483
  he said you weren't ready.    

42:33.485 --> 42:34.284
     He didn't choose you.      

42:34.285 --> 42:35.084
  he said you weren't ready.    

42:36.821 --> 42:39.055
 He didn't choose us either.    

42:41.826 --> 42:44.561
  One of us has to earn it.     

42:45.697 --> 42:46.663
             How?               

42:57.943 --> 42:58.608
             Ok?                

42:59.644 --> 43:00.476
             Ok.                

43:09.354 --> 43:10.687
      Put it in the box.        

43:19.631 --> 43:20.597
             Why?               

43:41.920 --> 43:43.853
 Where is this lake of yours?   

43:46.057 --> 43:47.690
        I can show you.         

43:52.530 --> 43:54.230
      How do we earn it?        

43:56.067 --> 43:58.301
    We get rid of that box.     

45:43.608 --> 45:45.908
     Journey well brother.      

46:20.912 --> 46:22.011
            You ok?             

46:22.480 --> 46:22.979
             Yeah.              

46:25.850 --> 46:26.816
            How far?            

46:30.054 --> 46:31.387
         I'm not sure.          

46:32.090 --> 46:33.890
 I don't recognise where I am.  

46:34.692 --> 46:35.558
     Just take a moment.        

46:35.760 --> 46:36.359
             No.                

46:36.728 --> 46:37.960
         No stopping.           

46:38.663 --> 46:40.129
 She's not your pet, back off.  

46:41.166 --> 46:42.064
      She's going to            
      get us all killed.        

46:42.066 --> 46:42.932
She's injured no thanks to you. 

46:42.933 --> 46:43.799
      She's going to            
      get us all killed.        

46:44.169 --> 46:45.401
         I will be ok.          

46:45.403 --> 46:46.052
     We should carry on.        

46:46.053 --> 46:46.702
         I will be ok.          

46:47.839 --> 46:49.906
    You do not get to decide    
    when and where we stop.     

46:50.441 --> 46:51.174
    You are not the leader.     

46:51.776 --> 46:52.475
        Neither are you.        

46:53.878 --> 46:55.411
     We should take the box     

46:55.413 --> 46:56.446
     Go back home, kill         
     the three masked men.      

46:56.447 --> 46:57.480
     We should take the box     

46:58.550 --> 47:00.082
     But no we die out          
     here for this other.       

47:02.053 --> 47:03.152
          This box.             

47:03.922 --> 47:05.721
Will never come back to Varosha.

47:06.124 --> 47:07.256
          Says who?             

47:07.725 --> 47:08.357
             You?               

47:08.359 --> 47:10.660
     Where's the other one?     

47:14.699 --> 47:15.898
             Thade?             

47:18.803 --> 47:19.535
         Open the box.          

47:19.537 --> 47:20.019
            Shut up.            

47:20.020 --> 47:20.502
         Open the box.          

47:21.472 --> 47:22.371
             Thade.             

47:45.463 --> 47:46.362
             Hey.               

47:48.833 --> 47:50.600
      You are an idiot.         

47:50.969 --> 47:52.468
         Not you too.           

47:53.171 --> 47:55.071
 We should all stick together.  

47:56.341 --> 47:58.040
      I found something.        

48:38.950 --> 48:41.083
      I've never seen           
      anything like it.         

48:41.519 --> 48:42.351
            Weapon?             

48:42.887 --> 48:45.021
    No, no i don't think so.    

48:52.297 --> 48:53.663
         What is it?            

48:55.633 --> 48:57.099
            No idea.            

48:57.635 --> 48:58.668
     It's old world tho.        

48:59.971 --> 49:01.704
At least we know we are         
heading in the right direction. 

49:05.343 --> 49:06.342
             Good.              

50:15.646 --> 50:17.513
     You lead for a while.      

50:18.316 --> 50:19.915
         My pleasure.           

50:26.424 --> 50:27.623
     Was he your father?        

50:27.625 --> 50:27.907
             No.                

50:27.908 --> 50:28.190
     Was he your father?        

50:28.793 --> 50:29.859
          But close.            

50:30.561 --> 50:32.294
  My parents died years ago.    

50:32.897 --> 50:33.696
             How?               

50:33.698 --> 50:36.365
My mother died when I was born. 

50:37.402 --> 50:39.702
     My father died here        
     is these trials.           

50:40.071 --> 50:41.203
          I'm sorry.            

50:42.173 --> 50:44.140
 Did they kill your parents?    

50:50.782 --> 50:52.131
             How?               

50:52.132 --> 50:53.481
  After the raid, they knew     
  they had been followed.       

50:54.185 --> 50:56.152
    So they gave me the box.    

50:57.355 --> 51:00.089
And told me to head to the old  
world and throw it in the lake. 

51:01.092 --> 51:02.258
 At first I did as I was told.  

51:02.994 --> 51:04.226
  But I couldn't leave them.    

51:05.296 --> 51:07.229
    So I hide the box in the    
    forest and went back.       

51:08.032 --> 51:09.265
     It was too late tho.       

51:10.101 --> 51:12.168
  Nine had killed them all.     

51:12.970 --> 51:15.071
     I saw my mother with       
     her throat slit.           

51:17.475 --> 51:20.076
      They hit me with          
      a spear a day ago.        

51:21.446 --> 51:23.946
 If I had never gone back       
 they would have had no idea    

51:23.948 --> 51:25.131
 and I would have thrown this   
 thing in the lake by now.      

51:25.132 --> 51:26.315
 If I had never gone back       
 they would have had no idea    

51:28.186 --> 51:29.485
         Let me see.            

51:39.363 --> 51:40.629
          Is it bad?            

51:41.566 --> 51:42.498
             Yeah.              

51:43.034 --> 51:44.600
     Am I going to be ok?       

51:59.851 --> 52:00.649
             Thade.             

52:00.651 --> 52:01.684
      How is your foot?         

52:01.685 --> 52:02.718
             Thade.             

52:04.355 --> 52:05.454
         Like you care.         

52:05.990 --> 52:08.057
     We must face facts.        

52:09.227 --> 52:11.794
  It's rare anyone make it      
  alive out of these trials     

52:12.396 --> 52:14.163
     Other than the leader.     

52:16.267 --> 52:19.001
you really want to die tonight? 

52:19.937 --> 52:20.870
             Look               

52:20.872 --> 52:27.042
All I'm saying is how much of   
a chance do you think you have  
with your foot like that against

52:27.411 --> 52:28.644
         the others?            

52:29.747 --> 52:31.881
         What can I do?         

52:34.719 --> 52:37.319
     Help me become leader.     

52:37.688 --> 52:38.721
        We take the box.        

52:39.857 --> 52:41.590
      We go home safely         
      and stay that way.        

52:42.860 --> 52:44.894
  You must see that by now.     

52:46.063 --> 52:47.229
            No Ares.            

52:47.798 --> 52:49.565
    That is not earning it.     

52:50.201 --> 52:50.699
          Says who?             

52:51.135 --> 52:51.834
             Nus.               

52:52.537 --> 52:54.370
      Nus is dead Thade.        

52:55.273 --> 52:57.540
     And so are we if we        
     don't do something.        

52:58.042 --> 52:59.708
         Why should I           

53:00.278 --> 53:02.344
     help you be leader?        

53:04.081 --> 53:05.581
         Look at you.           

53:06.284 --> 53:07.449
 You are not cut out for this.  

53:08.252 --> 53:09.185
     And neither is she.        

53:10.121 --> 53:11.720
  You have seen her temper.     

53:12.790 --> 53:14.557
    She will get the hole       
    tribe killed eventually.    

53:15.092 --> 53:16.292
             Thade.             

53:16.661 --> 53:18.093
        I see your face.        

53:18.629 --> 53:19.295
      You see the power.        

53:20.464 --> 53:22.131
         You liked it.          

53:25.736 --> 53:26.569
             How?               

53:27.104 --> 53:28.237
      WE split them up.         

53:29.006 --> 53:29.872
     You distract Eiren.        

53:30.942 --> 53:32.608
      I'll take the box         
      from the other.           

53:34.845 --> 53:36.445
      No killing anyone.        

53:37.248 --> 53:38.581
     She's already dead.        

53:39.350 --> 53:40.716
         As for Eiren.          

53:46.424 --> 53:48.390
      No killing Eirens.        

53:48.926 --> 53:50.326
         Or I'm out.            

54:13.884 --> 54:16.952
      We must protector         
      her understand?           

54:17.321 --> 54:18.988
         Understand?            

54:59.030 --> 55:00.396
         Come with me.          

55:06.070 --> 55:07.469
         Can you run?           

55:08.105 --> 55:09.004
             Go.                

55:51.382 --> 55:53.315
      We need to go back        
      and stop Ares.            

55:53.317 --> 55:53.933
             Why?               

55:53.934 --> 55:54.550
      We need to go back        
      and stop Ares.            

55:54.919 --> 55:56.251
         I'm so sorry.          

55:58.122 --> 55:59.288
             Thade!             

56:50.441 --> 56:51.640
          I'm sorry.            

56:52.376 --> 56:53.409
          What for?             

56:54.311 --> 56:55.411
             Ares.              

56:56.680 --> 56:58.447
        He wants to box.        

56:59.216 --> 57:00.649
    He's going to kill her?     

57:05.022 --> 57:06.588
            I knew.             

57:07.391 --> 57:09.091
         Your an idiot.         

57:14.698 --> 57:16.465
     I didn't want to die.      

57:19.336 --> 57:20.436
            It's ok.            

57:25.810 --> 57:28.477
    I would have chosen you.    

58:12.790 --> 58:14.490
         Arrrghhh...            

58:28.539 --> 58:29.605
          Back off.             

58:30.374 --> 58:31.507
            Arghhh.             

58:34.745 --> 58:35.677
            It's ok.            

58:38.883 --> 58:41.250
     What are you doing?        

58:41.619 --> 58:42.518
        What am I doing?        

58:43.287 --> 58:44.419
     What are you doing?        

58:44.822 --> 58:45.888
         Look at you.           

58:47.291 --> 58:48.757
      you are no leader.        

58:50.561 --> 58:51.793
        Where is Thade?         

58:51.795 --> 58:52.611
     We are dying out here.     

58:52.612 --> 58:53.428
        Where is Thade?         

58:53.797 --> 58:54.530
         And for what?          

58:55.132 --> 58:56.064
         This other.            

59:17.955 --> 59:19.655
  I'm going to take the box.    

59:20.791 --> 59:22.057
      And i'll use it on        
      you if I have to.         

59:22.927 --> 59:24.626
 We can go back to the camp.    

59:25.429 --> 59:26.895
    Tell them bus picked me.    

59:27.598 --> 59:28.730
  And I might let you live.     

59:29.266 --> 59:31.667
    Sounds great i'll pass.     

59:32.770 --> 59:34.803
     Why don't you think        
     this through for once.     

59:35.506 --> 59:37.272
  Believe me for once I am.     

59:38.309 --> 59:39.441
     Or I would have            
     killed you already.        

59:40.544 --> 59:44.513
 You kill me. I don't think so. 

59:45.049 --> 59:46.615
      Maybe he can help.        

59:47.184 --> 59:48.350
             CRACH!             

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:17.479
            Get up.             

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:19.448
          I'm done.             

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.298
         Take the box.          

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:39.167
 Throw it deep into the lake.   

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.808
        For my parents.         

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:54.916
            It's ok.            

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:56.885
          I'm here.             

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.858
      Eiren, I'm heart.

         Where is it?           

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.132
     I don't think so Ares.     

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.368
 You are not getting that box.  

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.670
 You just don't get it do you?  

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:30.872
      I know, you've            
      given your speech.        

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:32.357
     We're all going to         
     die, blar, blar, blar.     

01:03:32.358 --> 01:03:33.841
      I know, you've            
      given your speech.        

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:35.332
             No.                

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:35.587
      I know, you've            
      given your speech.        

01:03:35.588 --> 01:03:35.842
     I'm not going to die.      

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.078
          Just you.             

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:02.737
             Cute.              

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:32.701
         So your a god?         

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:34.970
  I thought you'd be taller.    

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.046
      Where is the box?         

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.650
        Your friend here        

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:51.887
     has told me about that     
     little tribe of yours.     

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.956
         Sounds nice.           

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.793
    I might pay it a visit.     

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.164
        Give me the box.        

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:11.139
              I                 

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:13.308
     will drink the blood       

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.660
  of every man, woman and       
  child you have ever known.    

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.011
     will drink the blood       

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.848
     And when I am done.        

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.685
    Their skin will decorate    
    the walls of my home.       

01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:25.787
             Now                

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:29.424
        Give me the box.        

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:35.163
We're here because of you Eiren.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.666
    Because of your choices.    

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:40.468
Nobody else has to die tonight. 

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:44.005
     I will protect them.       

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.541
  Just tell him where it is.    

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:57.052
             Ok.                

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.225
          Kill him.             

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.028
      And I'll tell you.        

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:10.498
             Done.              

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:13.201
     No wait we had a deal.     

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.139
          Arrrghhh!             

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:09.457
      How do we earn it?        

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.060
    We get rid of that box.     

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.587
          HORN SOUND            

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:43.158
         It's Eiren.            

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.797
  I'm starting to like her.     

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:16.124
         You came back.         

01:08:17.194 --> 01:08:19.426
 And you brought my box too.    

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:23.098
      Look like you make        
      friends quickly.          

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:30.872
    You are just a silly        
    girl playing with toy's     
    you don't understand.       

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:32.841
      Give me that box.         

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:35.443
    It is your only choice.     

01:08:36.046 --> 01:08:37.112
        Think about it.         

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.712
            I have.             

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:40.281
         And I think.           

01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:42.317

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:43.885
        Come and get it.        

01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:34.796
      Where is the box?         

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:40.335
      I should just kill        
      you right now.            

01:10:40.804 --> 01:10:41.436
             Try.               

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.271
         Such a waist.          

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.406
     All you have to do is      
     just do a your told.       

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.108
     I'm not good at that.      

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.884
          Arrrghhh!             

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:13.995
         I am a god.            

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.831
  You don't get to kill me.
