00:39.220 --> 00:41.130
This afternoon at 5:00.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.260
Il Duce will speak to the nation!

00:44.390 --> 00:46.260
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

00:46.430 --> 00:52.310
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

00:52.440 --> 00:55.730
are ordered to turn them on.

00:55.860 --> 00:59.650
Mussolini will speak to

00:59.740 --> 01:02.410
all Italians!

01:02.660 --> 01:07.200
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

01:07.290 --> 01:11.500
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
Il Duce will speak to the nation.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.880
<i>I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.</i>

01:17.050 --> 01:19.460
<i>And my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.</i>

01:20.090 --> 01:23.720
<i>That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...</i>

01:23.840 --> 01:27.760
<i>and I got my first bicycle.</i>

01:27.930 --> 01:31.350
The frame is British, the gears are German,

01:31.480 --> 01:34.350
the pedals are French,

01:34.400 --> 01:38.440
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.860
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.610
Are you sure it's safe?

01:43.610 --> 01:45.200
I have new bikes too.

01:45.820 --> 01:49.830
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

01:51.830 --> 01:53.250
Fighting men,

01:55.080 --> 01:58.340
on land, on sea and in the air,

01:59.250 --> 02:02.420
Black shirts of the revolution,

02:02.840 --> 02:04.840
men and women of Italy...

02:04.970 --> 02:08.180
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

02:35.580 --> 02:36.880
The hour...

02:38.960 --> 02:40.210
of decisions from which

02:41.000 --> 02:44.590
there is no return.

02:45.130 --> 02:48.430
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

02:48.510 --> 02:49.510
Who knows?

02:49.720 --> 02:52.520
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

02:52.930 --> 02:55.640
The declaration of war...

02:56.190 --> 03:00.570
has already been delivered to the ambassadors.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.790
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.670
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

03:24.090 --> 03:27.010
Hey, guys!

03:31.430 --> 03:33.140
Lucky bastard.

03:33.770 --> 03:37.270
- He got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

03:38.310 --> 03:41.020
Custom-made, just like the racers.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.980
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

03:45.030 --> 03:47.200
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.030
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

03:50.370 --> 03:52.280
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

03:52.410 --> 03:57.460
- And you, "Don Sasa"?
- I don't want some kid poking into our business.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.460
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

04:06.670 --> 04:07.470
She's coming!

04:12.010 --> 04:13.390
What's going on?

04:14.260 --> 04:18.480
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.860
- Who is she?
- The deaf guy's daughter, our new Latin teacher.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.450
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

06:19.510 --> 06:21.600
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

06:21.770 --> 06:25.690
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

06:26.270 --> 06:27.360
What's her name?

06:27.400 --> 06:31.480
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.370
The sun is bigger than the moon.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.670
Or Sol maior est quam lunam.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.920
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

06:51.380 --> 06:52.630
Yes, but hurry.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.590
I love honesty more than wealth.

07:40.470 --> 07:42.470
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.680
- Mine's a bazooka!
- I got eight!

07:44.810 --> 07:48.690
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

07:48.730 --> 07:52.400
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.940
Torpedo!

07:54.110 --> 07:57.200
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

07:59.410 --> 08:01.370
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

08:01.530 --> 08:05.580
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.750
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.750
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.340
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.340
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

08:19.510 --> 08:24.260
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

08:24.310 --> 08:27.730
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

08:27.850 --> 08:31.520
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.820
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

08:36.110 --> 08:37.860
and you still haven't measured yourself.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.159
Measure it!

08:41.450 --> 08:43.070
One, two,

08:43.530 --> 08:46.410
three, four, five...

08:46.540 --> 08:47.870
Only six!

08:49.460 --> 08:51.750
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.710
Short pants: Short dick!

08:55.050 --> 08:56.670
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

08:56.710 --> 08:57.880
Bullshit!

09:01.970 --> 09:04.510
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

09:04.760 --> 09:06.720
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

09:13.440 --> 09:15.610
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

10:11.250 --> 10:14.920
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

10:25.470 --> 10:27.050
What cigarettes do you want?

10:28.560 --> 10:30.140
Macedonia Extra.

10:48.780 --> 10:52.750
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.830
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.880
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.430
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

11:05.510 --> 11:06.890
My father's still young.

11:06.930 --> 11:10.260
And you're too young
for long pants.

11:10.430 --> 11:12.560
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.060
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

11:15.640 --> 11:18.730
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

11:18.810 --> 11:23.820
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

11:23.820 --> 11:26.280
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

11:27.570 --> 11:29.280
- Leave him alone!
- I know what I'm doing.

11:31.790 --> 11:35.410
And you let your friends beat you up.

11:35.540 --> 11:40.000
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

11:40.460 --> 11:44.630
But stealing trousers from your father...

11:44.800 --> 11:49.010
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.510
But, Papa, you don't understand!

11:50.890 --> 11:53.640
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

11:53.970 --> 11:56.140
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

11:56.270 --> 11:58.350
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

11:58.480 --> 12:00.270
Enough!
He's still a child!

12:00.400 --> 12:05.110
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

12:11.070 --> 12:12.910
Let's make a deal.

12:13.990 --> 12:18.290
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

12:19.710 --> 12:22.340
then you'll get long pants.

12:22.540 --> 12:23.710
Swear it.

15:00.330 --> 15:04.120
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.250
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.340
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

15:11.460 --> 15:13.470
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.180
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

15:17.260 --> 15:21.310
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

15:21.390 --> 15:23.980
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

15:24.100 --> 15:25.980
Not me!

15:29.190 --> 15:31.270
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

15:31.320 --> 15:35.400
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.940
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

18:54.980 --> 18:57.230
It's that pretty, romantic one...

19:00.980 --> 19:04.030
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

19:07.570 --> 19:09.280
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

19:09.450 --> 19:10.790
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

19:10.910 --> 19:13.960
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

21:37.560 --> 21:40.810
<i>Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,</i>

21:40.940 --> 21:45.270
<i>and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,</i>

21:45.440 --> 21:48.190
<i>it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.</i>

21:48.860 --> 21:52.410
<i>So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.</i>

21:52.450 --> 21:55.580
<i>I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...</i>

21:55.660 --> 22:00.370
<i>who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.</i>

22:00.370 --> 22:03.830
<i>I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.</i>

22:03.920 --> 22:07.880
<i>After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.</i>

22:44.620 --> 22:47.790
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.840
So long!

24:15.510 --> 24:17.630
Don't get lost!

24:17.760 --> 24:20.390
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

24:20.430 --> 24:21.890
Mind your own fucking business!

24:32.110 --> 24:36.490
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

25:08.310 --> 25:12.440
The show's over!
She's gone now!

26:08.160 --> 26:09.450
I forgot the key.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.680
So it's true what people say!

26:28.810 --> 26:30.930
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.350
You've poisoned me with your lies.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.610
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

26:35.980 --> 26:41.150
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.360
But I've never done anything wrong.

26:44.490 --> 26:47.490
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

26:47.660 --> 26:49.870
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

26:50.580 --> 26:53.210
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

26:53.420 --> 26:54.870
Liar!

26:59.630 --> 27:01.510
- Amoroso.
- Here!

27:01.630 --> 27:02.670
- Cali.
- Here!

27:03.300 --> 27:04.430
- Costanza.
- Here!

27:05.550 --> 27:08.470
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.930
Can I put mine in her mouth?

27:11.060 --> 27:13.060
Can I put mine
between her legs?

27:13.940 --> 27:15.810
Okay, but one at a time!

27:49.430 --> 27:52.430
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.100
I'm sure no one wanted her.

28:00.190 --> 28:02.030
They say she's a seamstress.

28:02.150 --> 28:04.190
But she's so vulgar.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.330
My son says she looks fake.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.330
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

28:17.420 --> 28:22.090
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.510
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

28:24.550 --> 28:28.340
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

28:28.720 --> 28:32.310
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.350
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.650
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

29:27.780 --> 29:30.360
Our brave and invincible Fighting men
have delivered a powerful blow...

29:30.450 --> 29:34.490
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

29:34.660 --> 29:38.830
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

29:39.000 --> 29:44.040
of our forces at the front,

29:44.210 --> 29:49.760
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

29:57.060 --> 29:58.730
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

31:24.390 --> 31:25.440
Malena.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.770
Right rank!
Eyes front!

31:27.900 --> 31:31.030
Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

31:31.190 --> 31:34.450
One, two! One, two!

31:34.650 --> 31:39.200
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.290
Malena is available!

32:11.190 --> 32:13.610
Comrades of Castelcuto,

32:13.780 --> 32:16.240
we are gathered here today...

32:16.240 --> 32:20.620
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

32:20.780 --> 32:23.120
which has struck our town.

32:23.450 --> 32:26.460
To express our deepest condolences...

32:26.500 --> 32:29.420
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

32:29.710 --> 32:34.420
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

32:35.630 --> 32:37.800
and to his bride Maddalena,

32:38.010 --> 32:42.510
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

32:42.510 --> 32:47.020
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

32:47.310 --> 32:51.400
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

32:51.770 --> 32:54.530
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

32:54.690 --> 32:56.900
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fighting men!

33:02.530 --> 33:06.620
Of our fellow citizen in defense of his country was not a useless

33:06.870 --> 33:09.500
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.960
A lucky girl will catch him!

33:14.130 --> 33:17.510
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

33:26.930 --> 33:28.770
For Victory!

33:28.770 --> 33:29.810
Long live II Duce!

34:55.520 --> 34:58.270
From now on I'll be at your side.

34:58.320 --> 35:01.030
Forever. I promise.

35:01.110 --> 35:03.410
Just give me time to grow up.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.210
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.380
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

36:03.420 --> 36:06.340
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

36:06.510 --> 36:08.510
She knows her way
around the block!

36:08.600 --> 36:11.350
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.600
One day he was distracted
as he walked by...

36:13.730 --> 36:17.730
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

36:18.610 --> 36:21.940
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

36:22.070 --> 36:25.200
Guess she's too busy!

36:27.950 --> 36:31.280
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

36:31.330 --> 36:32.790
with subversive tendencies.

36:32.870 --> 36:36.210
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

36:36.330 --> 36:40.710
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

36:40.840 --> 36:45.670
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

36:45.840 --> 36:48.260
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

36:48.430 --> 36:50.100
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

37:23.800 --> 37:26.590
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

37:26.630 --> 37:28.590
They're too intimate.

37:28.630 --> 37:31.800
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

37:31.930 --> 37:33.760
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

37:39.890 --> 37:45.440
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

37:45.570 --> 37:49.740
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

37:49.860 --> 37:53.530
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

38:45.750 --> 38:49.880
I am always at your service.

38:50.090 --> 38:52.090
- Renewed condolences, Malena.
- Condolences.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.770
What a piece of ass!

39:05.690 --> 39:06.770
Son of a bitch!

39:09.980 --> 39:11.070
You little runt!
Come back here!

39:30.170 --> 39:34.090
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

42:04.240 --> 42:06.330
Renato, It's late.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.660
Renato, get up.

42:17.050 --> 42:18.510
Monster!

42:18.670 --> 42:20.760
You're a fetishist,

42:20.880 --> 42:23.220
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

42:25.390 --> 42:28.140
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

42:31.190 --> 42:32.230
Shame on you!

42:32.350 --> 42:36.650
You shameless girl Can I keep them?

42:38.780 --> 42:43.030
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

42:43.160 --> 42:44.870
Come here, you little pig!

42:46.280 --> 42:48.200
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

42:50.120 --> 42:54.750
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

42:55.210 --> 42:57.420
- Answer me!
- Okay!

43:00.760 --> 43:04.550
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

43:04.640 --> 43:08.260
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

43:09.140 --> 43:12.390
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

43:13.100 --> 43:17.230
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

43:17.610 --> 43:20.400
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

43:20.530 --> 43:24.320
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

43:25.370 --> 43:26.530
Still... What is this shit?

43:26.660 --> 43:30.790
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

43:30.950 --> 43:32.750
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.710
Everything they give us is terrible!

43:35.750 --> 43:38.920
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

43:39.090 --> 43:41.460
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

43:41.590 --> 43:43.510
The thread isn't the problem!

43:43.550 --> 43:46.850
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

43:46.850 --> 43:49.810
What does that mean?

43:50.520 --> 43:52.480
Do you get it now?

43:52.930 --> 43:55.600
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

43:55.770 --> 43:58.650
But he'll have no pockets.

43:58.690 --> 44:01.320
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

44:02.940 --> 44:05.700
Lights out!

44:06.160 --> 44:11.370
...that the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor...

44:11.540 --> 44:14.620
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

44:20.710 --> 44:23.130
While upon womens work
you sat intent,

44:23.760 --> 44:26.550
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

44:26.970 --> 44:28.970
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

44:31.770 --> 44:34.270
This child needs air.

44:34.310 --> 44:36.480
- Air?
- Air.

45:05.590 --> 45:07.010
Good morning, Professor.

45:20.110 --> 45:22.190
This letter is for you.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.740
It says "urgent. "

45:36.080 --> 45:40.080
You're dishonored.
Your daughter Malena is sleeping
with the whole town.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.440
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

46:01.520 --> 46:04.230
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

46:04.400 --> 46:06.650
So there's hope for us too!

46:08.650 --> 46:10.320
Take it back!

46:10.360 --> 46:13.990
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

46:55.870 --> 46:57.450
Tonight was wonderful.

46:58.910 --> 47:02.920
- For me too.
- I know it's been only ten months since.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.880
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.340
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

47:10.470 --> 47:12.050
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

47:24.980 --> 47:26.730
Take care of yourself.

47:34.070 --> 47:37.490
So see you tomorrow?

47:37.530 --> 47:38.620
Yes.

47:40.290 --> 47:42.370
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

47:44.710 --> 47:46.750
What time?

47:48.960 --> 47:51.630
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

47:51.760 --> 47:56.010
How dare you
pester my fiancee!

47:56.140 --> 47:59.310
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

47:59.390 --> 48:01.470
You're a liar and a bastard!

48:02.100 --> 48:04.980
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

48:05.100 --> 48:08.230
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

48:09.650 --> 48:14.490
- Coward, scoundrel!
- Get up.

48:14.570 --> 48:16.660
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

48:16.820 --> 48:19.910
I'll break you in two!

48:21.200 --> 48:24.210
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

48:26.670 --> 48:30.670
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

48:30.750 --> 48:34.050
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

48:34.260 --> 48:37.430
With a traitor!

48:37.470 --> 48:40.100
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

48:40.260 --> 48:41.220
It's the dentist.

48:44.310 --> 48:46.900
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

48:47.100 --> 48:49.310
And as for you,

48:49.440 --> 48:52.860
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

49:04.160 --> 49:06.750
We knew she had one lover, but two?

49:06.920 --> 49:09.920
But where does
the dentist fit in?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.380
He fits in between her legs!

49:11.460 --> 49:15.470
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

49:15.590 --> 49:18.470
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

49:18.590 --> 49:21.850
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

49:21.930 --> 49:26.350
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

49:26.390 --> 49:30.770
What's the dentist
got to do with it, poor guy?

49:30.900 --> 49:34.150
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

49:34.320 --> 49:37.150
That Lt. Cadei seemed
like such a gentleman.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.490
How could he get mixed up in this?

49:39.610 --> 49:42.990
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.330
The lieutenant was asking for it!

49:45.410 --> 49:48.540
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
- Will they go to court?

49:48.670 --> 49:54.630
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

49:54.630 --> 49:59.180
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

49:59.340 --> 50:02.760
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

50:02.850 --> 50:04.890
That's insulting an officer.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.270
We'll all end up in court!

50:07.640 --> 50:10.310
While we were
watching her caboose,

50:10.350 --> 50:13.730
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

51:25.050 --> 51:26.850
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

51:26.970 --> 51:29.850
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

51:31.770 --> 51:33.810
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.770
Can I help you?

51:36.860 --> 51:39.570
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

51:40.030 --> 51:41.490
Please have a seat.

51:44.530 --> 51:46.830
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

51:46.950 --> 51:50.870
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

52:02.050 --> 52:03.380
Have her come in.

52:04.050 --> 52:05.470
- Go in.
- Thank you.

52:06.470 --> 52:08.470
Please sit down.

52:08.850 --> 52:10.430
Charmed.

52:15.850 --> 52:19.690
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

52:19.730 --> 52:23.030
the widow Scordia called Malena.

52:24.570 --> 52:26.450
She could get two years in prison.

52:28.700 --> 52:30.870
Everything will be fine, trust me.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.130
Sit down.

52:47.470 --> 52:51.390
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

52:51.510 --> 52:55.310
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

52:55.390 --> 52:57.650
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

52:57.810 --> 53:00.690
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

53:01.980 --> 53:02.860
Yes.

53:03.030 --> 53:07.860
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

53:08.160 --> 53:10.410
Absolutely not.

53:10.580 --> 53:13.080
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

53:13.160 --> 53:16.920
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

53:16.960 --> 53:19.040
on his way to your house?

53:19.080 --> 53:20.250
I don't know.

53:20.460 --> 53:24.550
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

53:40.730 --> 53:42.440
Yes, once.

53:47.740 --> 53:50.070
- Where?
- At my house.

53:57.290 --> 53:59.960
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

54:00.130 --> 54:05.590
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

54:05.760 --> 54:06.760
What did you do?

54:08.760 --> 54:11.340
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

54:13.470 --> 54:17.270
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

54:17.730 --> 54:18.690
I don't know.

54:20.020 --> 54:23.940
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

54:24.070 --> 54:26.280
He said good-bye and left.

54:30.610 --> 54:34.620
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

54:34.780 --> 54:36.580
who, five years ago...

54:36.620 --> 54:40.670
had the honor of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth...

54:40.790 --> 54:42.960
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

54:43.130 --> 54:47.550
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.420
Your husband's crazy.

54:49.630 --> 54:54.470
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

54:57.310 --> 55:02.560
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

55:02.690 --> 55:04.900
are no concern of the law.

55:06.860 --> 55:10.570
All right.
Did you know that,

55:10.950 --> 55:14.620
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

55:14.700 --> 55:15.370
One down.

55:15.580 --> 55:19.290
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.540
Clerk.

55:20.710 --> 55:23.120
He declared to have encountered

55:23.250 --> 55:27.670
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

55:27.750 --> 55:32.130
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

55:32.260 --> 55:36.680
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship. "

55:40.430 --> 55:41.690
Son of a bitch.

55:41.810 --> 55:45.860
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

55:45.980 --> 55:50.530
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

55:50.690 --> 55:53.240
certain feelings.

55:53.320 --> 55:56.870
But unlike the married Cusimano,

55:57.240 --> 56:02.000
who was, let's face it, guilty...

56:02.210 --> 56:04.830
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

56:05.580 --> 56:07.880
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

56:07.920 --> 56:13.510
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

56:13.590 --> 56:15.720
Cadei is...

56:15.930 --> 56:19.930
and was...

56:20.180 --> 56:21.430
a bachelor... a bachelor!

56:21.600 --> 56:23.600
Clever, that lawyer.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.650
He's a bachelor himself.

56:26.190 --> 56:30.980
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

56:31.230 --> 56:34.400
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

56:34.530 --> 56:37.160
than that of being ill-fated,

56:37.410 --> 56:41.080
alone and beautiful.

56:41.410 --> 56:43.250
Here is her crime: Her beauty!

56:43.370 --> 56:45.460
And from here, the envy,

56:45.500 --> 56:47.540
the lies, the disgrace,

56:47.960 --> 56:51.840
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

56:51.880 --> 56:55.720
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

56:56.590 --> 56:59.600
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

57:00.560 --> 57:05.940
in faraway East Africa.

57:06.980 --> 57:10.360
In the beating heart of our argument...

57:10.520 --> 57:15.110
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

57:15.450 --> 57:17.360
which asks just one question:

57:17.360 --> 57:19.530
Can a young woman...

57:19.620 --> 57:24.500
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

57:24.500 --> 57:29.750
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

57:29.880 --> 57:33.210
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

57:33.380 --> 57:36.470
a new ending to her own love story?

57:37.300 --> 57:39.260
Your Honor,

57:39.430 --> 57:41.680
the citizens
of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"

57:53.110 --> 57:55.360
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

57:55.530 --> 58:00.280
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

58:00.490 --> 58:03.490
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

58:04.120 --> 58:08.460
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

58:08.540 --> 58:12.500
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

58:12.790 --> 58:14.880
Let's get to us!

58:17.880 --> 58:20.970
I know it's not much.

58:21.050 --> 58:24.720
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

58:25.100 --> 58:27.140
Don't you understand?

58:27.310 --> 58:29.940
That's peanuts!

58:30.520 --> 58:32.810
My fee is much more than that.

58:33.110 --> 58:36.780
You'll never have enough money!

58:36.820 --> 58:39.900
But how will I ever repay you?

58:39.990 --> 58:42.910
It's very easy, my sweet.

58:42.950 --> 58:47.330
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

58:47.580 --> 58:49.250
I'm in love with you!

58:54.540 --> 58:56.590
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

58:57.380 --> 58:59.970
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.930
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

59:29.200 --> 59:33.710
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

59:33.750 --> 59:35.380
only once and never again.

59:35.460 --> 59:37.670
But you didn't keep our agreement.

59:39.630 --> 59:41.380
Now we're even.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.310
<i>Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...</i>

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.230
<i>wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.</i>

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.110
<i>Now I understand why.</i>

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.320
<i>It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.</i>

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.030
<i>But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.</i>

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:12.740
<i>They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.</i>

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:14.910
<i>I know how badly
they treat you here,</i>

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.460
<i>how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...</i>

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.000
<i>and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.</i>

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:25.380
<i>But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...</i>

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:28.680
<i>so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?</i>

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:33.720
<i>They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.</i>

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.980
<i>How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against</i>

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.140
<i>the sweat of an old man...</i>

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:43.150
<i>who never does anything
without his mother's consent?</i>

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.260
Is it true you're getting married?

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.640
What are you writing?

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.770
Give me that!
Let me see!

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:19.890
Get out!

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.790
Stand up straight.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.960
A little longer, Don Placido.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:51.050
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.340
Will they be ready tomorrow?

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:56.180
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.600
...as Allied bombings continue.

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:06.610
Wait for me.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.860
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.250
Moron! Idiot!

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:22.580
Idiot!

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.750
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.670
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.090
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:33.470
Never! Never!

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.760
Never!

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.000
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.540
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.000
Malena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:14.800
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:20.510
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.060
Yeah, his plan
is in his pants.

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.140
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.610
Good morning, Antonio.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.530
I brought some sugar and flour.

01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:57.900
- What about the bread?
- The best.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.950
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.120
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.479
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:42.170
It's Professor Bonsignore.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.470
Malena's father.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:52.990
I'm here for you.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.670
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.960
Condolences.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.550
Step aside, kid.

01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:11.300
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.350
Don't forget my offer.

01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.390
- Who is it?
- It's me.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.060
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.900
I brought you some more food.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.400
Come in.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.330
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.340
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.890
I can come every Thursday!

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.730
As long as you bring the food.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.390
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.400
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.150
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:34.030
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.200
Look who's here.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:01.390
She's a redhead now.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.220
Look how she's put together.

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:06.680
I'd like to cut off that hair.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.030
How disgusting!

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:14.520
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:18.270
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:21.860
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.740
But with the Germans?

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:28.370
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:31.660
The two whores run
from room to room...

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.540
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.500
Holy shit!

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:12.160
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:14.500
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.510
Rosa!

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:29.430
Come here!

01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.640
That's enough!

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:35.930
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.310
No.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.150
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:44.610
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.530
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.200
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:51.740
Cast the devil into the wild.

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:54.410
Shameful!

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.120
Disgraceful!

01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:03.210
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:06.090
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:09.380
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:19.810
Renato!

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.280
Renato, wait here for me.

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:38.580
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.120
- My father?
- He's coming.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.920
Ladies!

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.840
Choose the one you like.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.010
Ladies!

01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:50.970
What do we have here?

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:53.050
Fresh young meat.

01:20:59.410 --> 01:21:01.710
Lupetta, up to the room.

01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:06.500
Treat him right.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.100
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.140
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:23.810
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.690
Go ahead.

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.010
- Is it your first time?
- No.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.760
I've imagined it many times.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.930
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.900
Stay back.
This is between the women.

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.990
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:38.580
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:43.250
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.320
Now let's see
what men make of you!

01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:10.990
The madame is served.

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:21.600
Get lost!

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.610
Disappear!

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.720
- I know that face.
- Who is it?

01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:26.890
Nino Scordia,
Malena's husband.

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:30.310
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.490
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:48.620
Isn't that Malena's husband?

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:19.030
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:29.950
Do you know Malena Scordia?

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:31.910
Who's she?

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.540
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:36.460
We don't know anything.

01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.250
When we came,
no one was living here.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.920
No one?

01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:59.070
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:03.070
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:06.820
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:10.410
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:14.910
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.580
Sir, he lost his arm...

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:20.000
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:21.880
Me "boy-bar. " Coffee.

01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:25.930
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:27.090
Okay, okay.

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.140
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:33.480
Now no one will talk to me.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.020
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:38.100
No one in town knows
where she is.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.110
His wife was the woman

01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:44.860
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:47.820
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:50.200
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:18.060
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:22.020
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:26.440
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:28.410
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:30.870
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:36.620
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:41.880
You're a family of heroes!

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.550
You're right.

01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:50.180
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:54.640
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:58.390
You may find your wife there!

01:36:58.950 --> 01:37:02.870
Wait a minute. Come back!

01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:10.720
<i>Dear Signor Scordia,</i>

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.720
<i>forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.</i>

01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:20.060
<i>These last months have
taught me much about courage,
even if I have found little myself.</i>

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:23.190
<i>I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.</i>

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:27.650
<i>Around here, they only say
bad things about her.</i>

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:31.860
<i>But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.</i>

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:35.780
<i>You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.</i>

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.740
<i>It is true,
a lot of things happened,</i>

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.160
<i>but back then,
you had been dead along time.</i>

01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:47.210
<i>The last time I saw her, she was
on a train for Messina.</i>

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:51.670
<i>I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,</i>

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.720
<i>but my name is Renato.</i>

01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:35.930
Good morning, Judge.

01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:39.390
All is well, thank God.

01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:42.970
Eat up, my sweet pea.

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.660
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

01:38:59.410 --> 01:39:01.370
Giorgio, look who's here!

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:05.890
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.520
It's nothing.

01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:38.510
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:40.630
Quiet. She's here!

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:45.180
It took a lot of courage to come back.

01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:47.640
Look who's here.

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.810
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.810
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.320
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.070
She's put on weight, too.

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.530
But she's still beautiful.

01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:09.040
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.390
Good morning.

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.730
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:34.230
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.320
Nice things here!

01:41:40.110 --> 01:41:43.070
- Like it, Signora Malena?
- Yes.

01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:45.620
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.740
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.080
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:55.040
- Thank you.
- Good day.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.640
It's okay. I'll get it.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.730
Thank you.

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.030
Thank you for your help.

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:15.410
Good luck, Signora Malena.

01:43:45.570 --> 01:43:49.110
<i>I pedaled as fast as I could</i>

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.370
<i>as if I were escaping...</i>

01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:54.540
<i>from longing,
from innocence, from her.</i>

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:57.120
<i>Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.</i>

01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:00.290
<i>And as they've held me close...</i>

01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:04.920
<i>and asked if I will
remember them,</i>

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.260
<i>I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you. "</i>

01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:14.310
<i>But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...</i>

01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:15.600
<i>Malena.</i>

01:44:16.305 --> 01:44:22.277
