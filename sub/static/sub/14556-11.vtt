WEBVTT

00:09.710 --> 00:12.146
( alarm blaring )

00:20.821 --> 00:22.790
( alarm continues )

00:31.165 --> 00:34.168
Hey, Pete,
I think I got something.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.437
You better call it in.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.412
Agent Eppes?

00:44.445 --> 00:45.813
Yeah.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.215
David Sinclair.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.516
How you doing?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.717
John Reacher.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.352
I'm with the Bureau's
Security Division.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.753
Victim was a computer science
researcher

00:52.786 --> 00:54.088
for a private think tank.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
High-level
National Security clearance.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.425
DON:
Who's that?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.527
This is

00:59.560 --> 01:00.594
Robert Oliver.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.596
He's the CEO
of The Lorman Group.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.432
How are you?
Don Eppes, FBI.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.466
Hi.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.301
The Lorman Group
is the think tank?

01:07.335 --> 01:08.169
That's right.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.437
They have a number of contracts
with us

01:09.470 --> 01:10.671
for classified
government projects.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.840
So, the victim was one
of your employees?

01:12.873 --> 01:14.775
Yes. Uh, Dr. Hoke
was one of our

01:14.808 --> 01:16.477
senior researchers.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.212
- I'll check on the body.
- DON: All right.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.314
Any reason to think
the murder had anything to do

01:20.348 --> 01:21.615
with the work
he was doing for you?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.850
It's possible.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.455
Those Bureau Techs?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.223
No, they're
with my company.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.291
What are you doing?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.292
They're civilians.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.360
They have security clearance.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.731
DON: Gentlemen, back away from
that computer.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.501
REACHER: Agent Eppes, can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.471
I have an obligation
to secure

01:43.504 --> 01:44.538
the contents of
Dr. Hoke's computer.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.907
Well, I got an obligation
to investigate a murder,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.542
and whatever
these guys are doing,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.144
they're contaminating
my crime scene.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.579
Your crime scene?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.714
That's right. Unless
there's something I don't know,

01:53.747 --> 01:55.683
my homicide investigation's
gonna take priority

01:55.716 --> 01:56.884
over your security concerns.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.252
Don.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.523
We've got multiple stab wounds.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.625
The Coroner's Investigator says
he's been dead

02:04.658 --> 02:06.460
for almost two days.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.362
What was that about?

02:08.396 --> 02:10.531
He was going to let those guys
take data off that computer.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.732
Well, I think
somebody beat them to it.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.568
According to what I heard,
the files were already erased.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.836
All right, we're gonna start
with that.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.171
Nobody touches it.
All right.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.240
Let's get our people
on it immediately.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.474
All right. Adam, Carter.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.913
( echoing ):
We all use math every day...

02:25.946 --> 02:27.515
to predict weather...

02:27.548 --> 02:30.551
to tell time...

02:30.584 --> 02:33.621
to handle money.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.958
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.861
It's logic.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.397
It's rationality.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.301
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.478
WOMAN:
Okay, well, the first thing is,

02:57.511 --> 02:59.680
whoever wiped the information
off of this hard drive

02:59.713 --> 03:00.914
didn't make a copy of it.

03:00.948 --> 03:01.849
You sure about that?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.217
Absolutely.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.220
Hoke had an event log
on his computer.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.222
Recorded the wipe,
but no duplication.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.923
And whoever did do the wipe knew
exactly

03:09.957 --> 03:11.525
what they were doing.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.461
This code's been flipped
hundreds of thousands of times.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.329
Wait. Define flipped.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.798
A computer's language boils down
to binary code.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.634
Every bit of information
is a specific sequence

03:20.668 --> 03:23.504
of zeroes and ones,
like coins, all heads or tails.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.639
When you wipe the data,
you don't really erase it.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.342
You just start flipping
the coins back and forth.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.743
That destroys the code

03:29.777 --> 03:31.745
and renders the information
pretty much unintelligible.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.347
Now, mind you,
we're talking about

03:33.381 --> 03:35.683
binary code,
which is millions upon millions

03:35.716 --> 03:37.751
of zeroes and ones.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.554
In order to recreate the data,
I need to reconstruct

03:40.588 --> 03:42.256
the original sequence
of the code.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.458
To flip it back to the way
it was originally.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.893
- Try to.
- But as you said,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.296
you're talking about millions
and millions of numbers.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.597
CHARLIE: Now the program that
was used

03:49.630 --> 03:52.333
to flip Hoke's code
left a pattern behind.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.601
If I can find it,

03:53.634 --> 03:55.803
I can reverse engineer
the program

03:55.836 --> 03:58.539
and reconstruct
the original sequence.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.574
Give it a shot. Let me know
if you find anything.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.978
Hey.

04:05.012 --> 04:05.846
Hey.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.715
Jonas Hoke was
an applied physicist.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.417
Lived alone, no kids, and

04:09.450 --> 04:11.752
from everything I've heard
so far, totally devoted

04:11.785 --> 04:13.654
to his work.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.822
He was in the middle
of a divorce.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.324
Wife left him
a few months ago.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.525
Oh, yeah? Any history there?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.360
No police reports, no 911 calls.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.861
Neighbors say he was a quiet,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.062
friendly guy.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.397
Yeah, who somehow wound up

04:23.431 --> 04:24.832
being butchered
in his own house.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.899
House ransacked.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.835
You've got multiple stab wounds.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.603
Alarm tripped.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.705
Not really the M.O.
of a professional killer.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.073
Why is the alarm tripped
on the night

04:33.106 --> 04:34.675
the body's discovered,
as opposed

04:34.708 --> 04:35.709
to two days earlier,

04:35.743 --> 04:37.545
when the guy's
actually murdered?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.680
There's no evidence
the body was ever moved.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.715
Yeah, the neighbors
don't report

04:41.749 --> 04:43.551
seeing anyone else
in the area.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.519
Still, the house being
ransacked suggests

04:45.553 --> 04:47.087
somebody was searching
for something.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.523
Well, whoever wiped that file
knew what to look for,

04:49.557 --> 04:50.691
that's for sure.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.860
You think they trashed the house
on a ruse?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.528
Make it look like an amateur?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.466
Why don't you go check out
the wife?

04:58.499 --> 05:01.835
I'm going to talk to Reacher
about the Lorman connection.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.704
DAVID: Mrs. Hoke, I understand
there was a dispute

05:03.737 --> 05:04.705
over the money involved

05:04.738 --> 05:05.639
in the separation.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.108
I guess we both valued
our time together

05:08.141 --> 05:09.643
a little differently.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.845
Maybe it was because
he was angry I left.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.014
I don't know,
but Jonas felt it appropriate

05:14.047 --> 05:15.616
that I leave the marriage

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
with what I
came to it with.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.020
I wanted to ask him
for the 12 years back,

05:20.053 --> 05:21.689
but I didn't know how.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.891
When was the last time
you spoke to your husband?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.926
A few weeks ago.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.995
He was late
with a separation check.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.130
He'd do that-- forget.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.467
Sometimes I wondered
if it was intentional.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.037
Mrs. Hoke, I have to ask you,
where were you

05:37.070 --> 05:39.607
on the 14th?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.942
Right, I understand.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.044
As it happens, I was at home.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.879
Any witnesses
who can verify that?

05:45.913 --> 05:48.816
Lucas Grodin.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.883
He is a friend.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.423
I don't expect you
to understand.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.825
I'm not judging you, Mrs. Hoke.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.460
I'm just trying
to take your statement.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.896
So, your tech's sure
whoever it was

06:02.930 --> 06:04.698
who wiped Hoke's files
from the hard drive--

06:04.732 --> 06:05.733
they didn't make a copy?

06:05.766 --> 06:06.767
That's right.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.769
Apparently, it was erased,
but not duplicated.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.038
My bosses will be
happy to hear that.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.740
You know, you guys...

06:12.773 --> 06:14.041
You ought to remind your bosses

06:14.074 --> 06:16.477
that a man was murdered
over this, you know?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.579
I didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

06:18.612 --> 06:22.049
Look, what exactly did Hoke do
for The Lorman Group?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.421
The company had a contract
with the Defense Department

06:27.455 --> 06:28.622
for a new computer system,

06:28.656 --> 06:31.425
one that could better interpret
global satellite imaging.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.528
So, so new
that someone would kill over it?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.930
It's pretty sensitive stuff,

06:36.964 --> 06:38.799
but a motive for murder?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.734
I don't know.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.007
Hey. So Hoke was working on a
DOD contract

06:47.040 --> 06:48.576
for a computer
program

06:48.609 --> 06:50.678
that interprets
satellite images.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.812
Remote Sensing.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.946
It's a process that scans

06:52.980 --> 06:55.949
electromagnetic signatures
from the earth's surface.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.919
It was used to detect
prehistoric Incan paths

06:58.952 --> 07:01.088
to sacred burial sites.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.756
Hoke was probably developing it

07:02.790 --> 07:04.692
to read roadside bombs
or ruts from tanks.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.460
Why didn't you tell
me you found this?

07:06.494 --> 07:07.895
Because that data
wasn't the focus

07:07.928 --> 07:08.929
of the hard drive wipe.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.063
All right. What was?

07:13.266 --> 07:16.036
Say I want to hide
what I've written.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.209
Have I hidden it?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.883
CHARLIE:
Exactly.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.685
The impression runs deeper

07:31.719 --> 07:34.021
than the one sheet
I've written it on.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.857
Now, if I really wanted
to conceal it, I would do this.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.838
Hoke's remote
sensing work

07:50.871 --> 07:52.940
was erased with the equivalent

07:52.973 --> 07:55.275
of a magic marker,
but this section here

07:55.308 --> 07:57.911
was scribbled out
with a data scrubber--

07:57.945 --> 07:59.647
the equivalent of a pencil.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.981
On the surface,

08:01.014 --> 08:02.783
it renders the computer code
meaningless,

08:02.816 --> 08:03.984
but here there are magnetic

08:04.017 --> 08:05.052
shadows underneath,

08:05.085 --> 08:08.188
pieces of data left behind
that I was able to find.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.923
All right, tell me.

08:09.957 --> 08:10.858
Numbers.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.027
Specifically, like,
baseball statistics.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.963
Baseball statistics?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.031
Batting averages,
on-base percentages.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.166
I mean, as far as I can tell,

08:19.199 --> 08:20.100
Hoke was developing a pretty

08:20.133 --> 08:22.970
sophisticated application
of sabermetrics,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.939
which places numerical values
on specific skills,

08:25.973 --> 08:27.675
like home runs, hits, walks.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.577
A lot of teams use sabermetrics

08:29.610 --> 08:32.813
to identify the best way
to allocate their resources.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.815
Yeah. What was that book
about the...?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.249
It was the Oakland A's GM.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.050
Money Ball.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.652
Yeah, Money Ball.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.688
Right. Only Hoke was taking
his formulas to a whole

08:40.721 --> 08:42.756
new level, attempting
to predict player performance

08:42.790 --> 08:43.957
based on statistical curves.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.093
All right, so, why
erase baseball stats?

08:46.126 --> 08:48.295
And why kill over it?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.830
I have no idea.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.964
Hmm.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.165
But I might be able

08:52.199 --> 08:54.167
to use a predictive equation
to rebuild the missing data,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.236
like detecting the original
lines here, and guessing

08:56.269 --> 08:57.805
at what letters
they could make.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.806
Right. Well, I mean,

08:58.839 --> 09:00.774
we got to know
what they were trying to hide.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.948
OLIVER: Obviously, it was quite
a shock to hear about Jonas.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.584
To see him like that.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.019
I'm sure.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.754
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.988
Yeah. We'd
worked together

09:15.022 --> 09:15.956
for quite a while.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.858
Well, I'm gonna need
to get a consultant in

09:17.891 --> 09:19.092
to access Dr. Hoke's computer.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.661
Well, I don't
see a problem.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.035
So, this is Dr. Hoke's

09:28.068 --> 09:29.803
office.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.971
This is Scott Reynolds.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.740
He's Dr. Hoke's
research assistant.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.708
Has anything else been touched
in this office?

09:34.742 --> 09:35.843
Uh, no. Uh,

09:35.876 --> 09:37.711
Agent Reacher told us
to leave everything in place.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.212
What are you doing
on this computer?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.348
Just answering E-mails,
general housekeeping.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.983
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you did that

09:43.016 --> 09:44.685
someplace else
for the time being.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.619
Okay.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.754
You worked with Dr. Hoke
on a daily basis?

09:46.787 --> 09:47.688
Yeah.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.989
You remember

09:49.022 --> 09:50.223
what you were doing
on the 14th?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.224
Uh, it was a Tuesday?

09:51.258 --> 09:52.693
Um, he came in that Monday,

09:52.726 --> 09:54.227
and then I didn't hear
from him again

09:54.261 --> 09:56.864
till Mr. Oliver called me
and told me what happened.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.265
Well, he was missing
for two days.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.933
Wasn't that a little unusual?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.935
No, he would stay home
from the office

10:01.969 --> 10:03.236
three, four days at a time.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.638
Scott's right.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.139
Jonas could get
lost in his work.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.008
DON: Was Dr. Hoke a fan of
baseball,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.010
by any chance?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.144
- Baseball?
- Yeah.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.880
Oh, I'm not sure.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.015
Uh, he never went to
any games or anything,

10:15.048 --> 10:16.049
if that's what you mean.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.785
Why do you ask?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.087
It's just a little survey
I'm doing.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.089
You gentlemen are going to have
to leave this office.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.095
Well, apparently, Hoke
wasn't that into baseball.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.863
I mean, there's
no autographed balls,

10:29.897 --> 10:31.064
no sports memorabilia
whatsoever.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.666
So, whatever his interest,

10:32.700 --> 10:34.234
as far as I could tell,
it wasn't personal.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.369
Maybe he was interested
in sabermetrics as a hobby?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.772
Well, it doesn't seem like that
should get you stabbed to death.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.140
How are you doing
on recreating his data?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.209
I've been running
the corrupted files

10:42.242 --> 10:43.811
through a series of algorithms
on my computer.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.212
All right, well, as soon
as you find anything,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.014
let me know, 'cause I want
to get you out here

10:47.047 --> 10:48.415
and look
at his computer, all right?

10:48.448 --> 10:49.750
All right, well, I'm actually

10:49.783 --> 10:51.218
on my way to give
a lecture right now,

10:51.251 --> 10:52.052
but sure, afterwards,

10:52.085 --> 10:53.754
any way I can help.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.923
All right, good,
thanks, Charlie.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.357
Now, did I just hear you

10:57.390 --> 10:59.192
say the word
"sabermetrics"?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.094
Familiar with it?

11:01.128 --> 11:02.129
The "Money Ball" craze?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.931
Oh, yes, I'm
familiar with it.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.265
I take it you don't approve.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.101
Well, the notion
that human achievement

11:08.135 --> 11:11.104
on a baseball diamond
can be predicted

11:11.138 --> 11:14.374
through the application
of statistical analysis

11:14.407 --> 11:17.477
is, at it's very core,
highly problematic.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.113
Even if the skill can be
statistically measured?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.849
Yes, because, Charles,

11:21.882 --> 11:24.084
the human spirit
is immeasurable.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.220
You know, our brains aren't
just these machines.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.723
There's a lot of
either/or going on here.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.359
Yes, statistical probability
is a wonderful tool,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.261
but applied
to human performance,

11:34.294 --> 11:36.730
it's only an extrapolation
of the past.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.732
Still there are a number
of baseball teams

11:38.766 --> 11:40.934
that use sabermetrics
to determine who to pay.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.236
As a Dodger fan, I'm
all too painfully

11:43.270 --> 11:44.237
aware of that fact,

11:44.271 --> 11:47.140
but I'm also aware that
in a statistical model,

11:47.174 --> 11:49.276
the Red Sox never
beat the Yankees.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.178
Ah, there are exceptions
to every rule.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.413
Yes, and aren't they glorious?
( chuckles )

11:53.446 --> 11:55.749
Now, why is Don even
asking you about

11:55.783 --> 11:57.350
statistical
baseball analysis?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.220
( sighs ): A researcher was
found murdered.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.522
Wait, are we talking
about Jonas Hoke?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.524
You knew him?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.859
He... yeah.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.161
We were doctoral
students together.

12:08.195 --> 12:11.098
Well, not together,
but at the same time.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.499
He just-- I don't know.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.101
There's that old saying:

12:14.134 --> 12:16.103
"Applied physicists
are from Venus,

12:16.136 --> 12:17.504
"theoretical physicists...

12:17.537 --> 12:20.107
...wonder why it rotates
in the opposite direction."

12:20.140 --> 12:21.108
There you go.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.410
No, our department was
informed of his passing

12:23.443 --> 12:25.312
and the planned
memorial service.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.313
I'm sorry.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.149
Well, the book
doesn't always work, Charles,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.084
and numbers can't always

12:31.118 --> 12:34.154
account for the way
life turns out.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.223
Well, I mean, just
ask Jonas Hoke.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.063
DON:
What do you say, David?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.865
Hey. Anything
at The Lorman Group?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.166
Well, Hoke didn't
show up for work

12:46.199 --> 12:47.935
for two days,
and he wasn't missed.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.938
That's either very sad,
or that's a really good job.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.272
Yeah? Seemed odd to me.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.874
Well, guess who had

12:53.907 --> 12:56.243
a $2 million
insurance policy.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.545
What? The good Dr. Hoke?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.480
Mm-hmm. And guess who
the beneficiary is?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.282
Not the wife.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.451
Yep. Turns out the divorce
was nastier than we thought.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.054
Major issue being
Hoke's potential earnings.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.222
Apparently, he didn't
want to give her any.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.323
So she takes him out

13:10.357 --> 13:11.925
and gets the money
she's entitled to?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.493
Then she's free

13:13.526 --> 13:15.562
and single again.

13:15.595 --> 13:19.099
He's her alibi the night of the
murder. Arrested in '84.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.034
Assault and battery.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.202
I guess she figured

13:22.235 --> 13:23.570
Hoke was worth more
dead than alive.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.611
MAN:
I was twenty years old.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.313
I got in a fight
with a guy at a bar.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.414
Two years probation,
believe me,

13:34.447 --> 13:35.482
I learned my lesson.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.050
Which was what--

13:37.084 --> 13:38.952
don't leave any witnesses
behind the next time?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.054
You have some
imagination.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.189
We do.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.256
How about you
imagining this--

13:43.290 --> 13:45.592
Gail Hoke's in the middle
of a bad divorce, right?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.327
I mean, it really
isn't going well.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.096
On the other hand,
a dead husband pays out

13:49.129 --> 13:51.464
on a $2 million
insurance policy.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.533
Wonder how many
of these you'd have to work

13:53.566 --> 13:54.534
to make up that.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.336
And, killing Jonas helps me how?

13:56.369 --> 13:57.637
Because maybe Gail
will give me

13:57.670 --> 13:59.439
some of her
insurance settlement?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.074
Well, with him out of the way,

14:01.108 --> 14:02.442
she's free to marry again.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.312
Gail and I like each other.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
Maybe it's even more than that,

14:07.380 --> 14:10.517
but neither one of us
has ever talked about marriage.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.584
All right.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.353
We'll be in touch.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.124
Gail Hoke wasn't
over her ex-husband.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.892
I got that much
from both of them.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.994
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't kill him.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.095
Yeah, but I got the feeling

14:22.129 --> 14:24.364
she wasn't willing to admit
the marriage was over.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.166
She was thinking
about going back to him.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.300
How'd you get that?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.236
Kind of reminded me
of my sister Linda

14:29.269 --> 14:30.403
when she got divorced.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.972
Moved out, got her own place,

14:32.005 --> 14:33.941
sat around waiting
for her ex to call

14:33.974 --> 14:36.443
instead of getting out
and getting on with her life.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.979
Did he call?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.413
Yeah, and she
went back to him.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.415
I always thought she
could've done better,

14:42.449 --> 14:44.217
you know, just given
herself a chance.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.318
Thanks.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.486
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.620
Knucklehead, you know.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.091
Hello. I'm sorry.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.292
I have pretty
specific instructions.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.327
No one's supposed
to use this computer.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.996
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You must be Scott.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.297
- Yeah.
- I'm Professor Charlie Eppes.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.532
Oh, I'm the, um,
yeah, I'm the... FBI consultant.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.001
Oh, all right.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.502
Yeah, Mr. Oliver
said you were coming.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.470
I was told that, uh,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.305
none of
Dr. Hoke's work

15:05.338 --> 15:07.640
was to be touched
before I got here.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.509
No, all that stuff's mine.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.510
Oh, you're leaving.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.245
Yeah. Well,
they probably

15:12.279 --> 15:15.015
would have offered me
another position here,

15:15.048 --> 15:16.483
but Dr. Hoke was kind of,

15:16.516 --> 15:17.550
kind of a mentor to me,

15:17.584 --> 15:20.988
and you work that closely
with someone, it's hard.

15:21.021 --> 15:21.955
Mm. I can imagine.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.557
I work pretty closely
with someone myself.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.726
He always wanted me
to go back to school,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.528
finish my dissertation, so...

15:28.561 --> 15:29.396
Thinking now I will...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.564
Oh, that's great.
What's your field?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.632
Econometrics, specializing

15:32.665 --> 15:33.700
in economic statistics.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.535
Ooh.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.071
Yeah, that's exactly
what my dad said

15:38.105 --> 15:39.372
when I told
him I was gonna

15:39.406 --> 15:41.208
borrow 30 grand
a year to pay for it.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.576
He's like, "You don't make money
by studying it."

15:43.610 --> 15:45.578
Mathematics can be
much more lucrative

15:45.612 --> 15:46.546
than most fathers think.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.682
Yeah, but I want to
do something with it.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.986
You know, make a difference
in the world.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.687
That's really admirable.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.556
Well, 'cause people,
they assume

15:56.589 --> 15:59.026
that the economy's this
adversarial relationship,

15:59.059 --> 16:01.628
where one person's gain,
by definition,

16:01.661 --> 16:04.197
has to be another person's loss.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.299
But it doesn't
have to be that way.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.301
There can be gains for everyone.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.203
- I'm sure you're right.
- No, I know I am.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.704
It's all there in the numbers...

16:11.738 --> 16:13.373
if anyone would just
bother to look.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.175
Ah, I think I know
just how you feel.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.776
Well, if you need me
for anything,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.546
- just let me know.
- Hey, Scott.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.614
Is there any reason
that Dr. Hoke

16:21.648 --> 16:25.485
would've been working
on, like... baseball formulas?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.220
Yeah, you know,
the other FBI agent

16:27.254 --> 16:29.256
asked me that same thing
about baseball.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.357
I-I told him

16:30.390 --> 16:32.092
Dr. Hoke never
mentioned it.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.360
Yeah. Any backup files,

16:33.393 --> 16:34.561
any-any other workstation

16:34.594 --> 16:36.463
that Dr. Hoke might have used?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.098
No. That man was particular

16:38.131 --> 16:39.466
about where he worked.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.069
It was either this computer or
the one at home.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.704
And you weren't aware of any
of his work on sabermetrics?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.039
But then again,

16:46.073 --> 16:50.743
I'm not much of a baseball fan.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.780
(footsteps)

17:01.288 --> 17:02.755
Larry.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.091
Charlie.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.193
What are you
doing here?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.760
Well, you mentioned a memorial,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.062
and I knew you'd be here.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.697
Oh, yeah.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.434
It's a rather

17:14.467 --> 17:17.737
disheartening
turnout, isn't it?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.239
Are we early?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.208
No, I don't
think so.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.645
It's physics.

17:25.678 --> 17:29.482
It's such
a demanding field.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.085
Leaves little time or
energy for a social life.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.721
Einstein said that one
has either time

17:34.754 --> 17:36.456
for science or family...

17:36.489 --> 17:37.624
but not both.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.659
Well, now, that's
spoken like a man

17:39.692 --> 17:43.296
who can appreciate
our predicament.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.765
CHARLIE: I wonder though... Is
our work the actual cause,

17:45.798 --> 17:48.335
or is it an excuse?

17:48.368 --> 17:51.371
That's a fair
hypothesis, isn't it?

17:51.404 --> 17:55.575
I suppose the real trick
is in finding the solution

17:55.608 --> 17:57.577
while it still matters.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.280
ALAN: What do these formulas
tell you?

18:00.313 --> 18:02.715
CHARLIE: The ones I've recovered
indicate that the Dodgers

18:02.749 --> 18:03.650
are not on the right track

18:03.683 --> 18:05.452
to win the pennant next year.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.155
Like you needed math
to figure that one out, huh?

18:08.188 --> 18:10.790
( chuckling ):
No.

18:10.823 --> 18:11.924
( chuckles )

18:11.958 --> 18:14.694
I heard that, uh, Don
was leaning towards the wife.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.829
That's right.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.799
Seems to be the first place
they look nowadays.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.033
I don't understand.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.137
I mean, if you hate the person
you're married to that much,

18:24.171 --> 18:25.705
get divorced.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.541
Even the thought of divorce
holds its own special horrors,

18:28.575 --> 18:29.476
let me tell you.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.578
Well, you and Mom
never thought about...

18:31.611 --> 18:34.747
I mean, I was never
witness to any kind of...

18:34.781 --> 18:37.317
That's exactly
the way we wanted it.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.688
Well, it was a long
time ago, we, um...

18:41.721 --> 18:44.724
We had a little rough patch
there for a moment,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.526
but we got through it.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.532
How rough a patch
are we talking about?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.800
It was when you
were 13 years old,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.368
and you went off to Princeton.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.204
Mom came with me.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.640
The separation was...

19:00.673 --> 19:03.510
pretty hard on both of us.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.179
And aside from
the money matters,

19:06.213 --> 19:08.881
there was this
irrational jealousy.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.584
Anyway, even the
possibility of divorce

19:11.618 --> 19:13.386
was never discussed,

19:13.420 --> 19:15.455
because we loved each other
too much.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.791
I don't remember any of it.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.527
I don't even remember

19:20.560 --> 19:23.563
a raised voice
between the two of you.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.532
That's because your mother
and I both agreed

19:25.565 --> 19:26.866
that we wouldn't
stress you or Don

19:26.899 --> 19:27.934
any more than we had to.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.571
Charlie, that's how

19:31.604 --> 19:34.307
parents argue
in front of their children;

19:34.341 --> 19:36.543
they disguise the big things
as little things.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.782
CHARLIE: Big things disguised as
little things.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.584
In World War II,
U.S. submarines

19:44.617 --> 19:46.686
were equipped
with bathythermographs,

19:46.719 --> 19:48.955
which helped them find
warm pockets of water

19:48.988 --> 19:51.391
beneath colder ones,
because warm water

19:51.424 --> 19:52.925
bent the sound waves away.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.762
If the submarine hid
in the right place,

19:55.795 --> 19:57.730
the enemy's sonar was useless.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.934
Hoke did the same thing
with his own data.

20:01.968 --> 20:02.935
He hid it in warm water.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.838
He disguised his work
as baseball statistics,

20:05.872 --> 20:07.640
thereby hiding its real meaning.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.775
How'd you figure it out?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.610
CHARLIE:
The magnetic shadows that were

20:10.643 --> 20:11.711
left on the hard drive

20:11.744 --> 20:12.812
after the wipe.

20:12.845 --> 20:13.680
I ran the extrapolated data

20:13.713 --> 20:15.782
through a series
of simple algorithms.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.883
The end result was

20:16.916 --> 20:17.684
that the baseball

20:17.717 --> 20:18.918
statistics fell away,

20:18.951 --> 20:20.687
leaving the pertinent numbers.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.789
I then did a simple
brute force analysis...

20:22.822 --> 20:24.791
Brute force?

20:24.824 --> 20:27.560
I just went on the internet
and Googled the set of numbers.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.995
I sifted through the hits
one by one,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.630
to find the matching
data tables.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.764
( beeps )

20:31.798 --> 20:34.634
Hoke pulled his data off of U.S.
Census Bureau reports

20:34.667 --> 20:35.935
over the last ten years.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.305
Other tables
were federal budgets,

20:38.338 --> 20:40.640
grade point averages,
SAT scores.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.474
Grade point averages?

20:41.508 --> 20:42.942
Hoke's work had nothing

20:42.975 --> 20:44.677
to do with baseball at all.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.880
He was attempting to apply
the concept of sabermetrics

20:47.914 --> 20:50.417
to average communities,
not athletes.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.918
You're talking about
real people?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.920
Actuaries do it all the time.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.523
Uh, taking into account
income levels,

20:56.556 --> 20:58.425
access to health insurance.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.827
Only Hoke wasn't measuring
life expectancy;

21:00.860 --> 21:02.695
he was measuring
human potential.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.863
What do you mean?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.832
Like predicting success?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.767
Almost from birth.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.369
That's not possible.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.304
Baseball teams use sabermetrics

21:11.338 --> 21:13.406
to determine
which players to pay.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.509
He was using sabermetrics
to determine what people

21:16.543 --> 21:17.844
were worth investing in.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.045
So no one gets left behind,

21:19.078 --> 21:20.880
they just never get started
to begin with.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.349
It applies to schools.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.517
It applies to hospitals,
to libraries.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.919
I mean, companies
fire employees who smoke

21:26.953 --> 21:29.856
because of future statistical
probabilities of cancer.

21:29.889 --> 21:33.393
Uh, they use DNA to deny
employees access to healthcare.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.728
I mean, why not
a mathematical analysis

21:35.762 --> 21:36.896
to do the exact
same thing?

21:36.929 --> 21:38.698
And you're saying he was
actually close?

21:38.731 --> 21:39.999
Well, from what I can tell,

21:40.032 --> 21:42.034
he hadn't finished
his main equation,

21:42.068 --> 21:43.235
though once he was through,

21:43.269 --> 21:46.706
theoretically, he'd be able
to predict human performance

21:46.739 --> 21:49.041
based on geographic
and environmental factors,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.443
down to a city block.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.944
So basically,
you are where you live?

21:51.978 --> 21:54.614
A mathematical determination
of who will

21:54.647 --> 21:55.915
or won't be a winner.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.395
REYNOLDS:
I've never seen any

22:08.428 --> 22:09.562
of this
stuff before.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.431
Well, it's an incredible
amount of data.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.966
So you're saying Dr. Hoke
never asked for your help?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.001
With this?
Absolutely not.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.369
I mean, you
know how it is.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.570
He works alone.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.971
I'd get glimpses,
but it's not like

22:19.005 --> 22:19.839
he includes me
or anything.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.941
Yeah, but what about research,
Scott?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.543
I mean, you never
prepared charts,

22:23.576 --> 22:24.744
or downloaded statistics?

22:24.777 --> 22:25.845
That seem a little weird,

22:25.878 --> 22:28.047
considering what you thought
he might be working on?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.982
Um, there's some market research
studies

22:30.016 --> 22:31.083
that he asked
me to get.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.118
Yeah?

22:32.151 --> 22:34.120
But I don't know.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.555
Market research?

22:35.588 --> 22:37.824
Yeah, stuff
the Lorman Group was compiling.

22:37.857 --> 22:38.958
What kind of stuff?

22:38.991 --> 22:41.794
Household incomes,
housing costs,

22:41.828 --> 22:43.396
buying
tendencies.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.998
This was all stuff
the Lorman Group was working on?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.100
Yeah. Um, Dr. Hoke would make
the request,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.903
and then Mr. Oliver would
have me E-mail it to his home.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.004
And when was this?

22:52.038 --> 22:54.741
Up until a few weeks ago.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.108
What happened a few weeks ago?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.810
For the last request,

22:57.844 --> 22:59.912
Mr. Oliver called
me into his office,

22:59.946 --> 23:02.048
and he said the
company was not going

23:02.081 --> 23:03.082
to allow Dr. Hoke

23:03.115 --> 23:04.884
access to the information
anymore.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.018
Did he tell you why?

23:06.052 --> 23:08.154
I mean, it's not really my place
to ask,

23:08.187 --> 23:09.021
but I just
remember

23:09.055 --> 23:11.023
Dr. Hoke was pretty upset
about it.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.492
Oh, yeah?

23:12.525 --> 23:13.926
Okay. Thanks for talking to us.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.194
I'll take that.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.195
Yeah.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.664
Thanks a lot, Scott.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.398
All right.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.771
Sounds like Hoke was going
behind the company's back,

23:24.804 --> 23:26.539
trying to develop
a new software program.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.108
Either that, or
trying to hijack it.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.645
Explains why Oliver shows up
the night the body's found.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.081
Yeah, he's gonna get back
his program, right?

23:35.114 --> 23:37.584
Question is, did they want it
bad enough to kill him for it?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.185
Well, I mean,
he was concerned

23:39.218 --> 23:41.688
that someone was going
to steal it, right?

23:41.721 --> 23:44.090
Otherwise, why disguise it
as baseball stats?

23:44.123 --> 23:46.125
And why would he bother to do it
on his own home computer?

23:46.158 --> 23:48.060
Unless he was worried
that his house

23:48.094 --> 23:49.829
wasn't as private
as he thought it was.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.546
Don,

24:39.579 --> 24:41.347
take a look.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.787
Oh, yeah,
look at that.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.988
Something was there.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.557
Mm-hmm.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.759
Maybe they didn't have time
to pull the wire.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.827
A dead body decomposing a few
feet away--

24:54.861 --> 24:56.629
maybe they felt
the need to rush.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.201
DON:
Oh, yeah.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.304
Someone put some kind
of surveillance there.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.540
Hoke had a reason
to be paranoid.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.211
See, that must be why
the alarm went off

25:12.244 --> 25:13.212
two days late.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.548
DAVID: So someone came in after
he was murdered

25:15.582 --> 25:16.649
to remove the device.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.117
That's what tripped it.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.286
So, someone planted
a surveillance device

25:20.319 --> 25:21.688
in Dr. Hoke's house.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.989
Well, judging
by your tone,

25:23.022 --> 25:26.158
you think that
someone is me?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.160
Dr. Hoke was working
on a software program

25:28.194 --> 25:30.897
that would be extremely
valuable to a lot of people.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.032
Yes, well, I gave
the FBI full access

25:33.065 --> 25:34.701
- to the imaging data.
- DON: Well, actually,

25:34.734 --> 25:37.169
we found a second body of work
on his home computer,

25:37.203 --> 25:39.305
and it had nothing to do
with your satellite program.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.973
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:41.007 --> 25:41.574
No?

25:42.642 --> 25:43.342
You sure?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.211
So if our consultant wanted

25:45.244 --> 25:47.046
to develop that data,
you wouldn't assert a claim?

25:47.079 --> 25:50.583
Well, The Lorman Group
has a contract with every

25:50.617 --> 25:53.720
researcher we employ, so
anything that Dr. Hoke

25:53.753 --> 25:55.955
worked on is owned
by the company.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.123
Maybe he didn't agree.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.191
Maybe you went to his house,
argued.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.327
The night I met you
is the only time

26:01.360 --> 26:03.095
I was ever in
Dr. Hoke's house.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.797
There's more then one way
inside of a person's home.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.366
Look, we want that surveillance,
okay?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.334
I want my lawyer.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.603
You sure? 'Cause
if someone happened to leak

26:10.637 --> 26:11.704
to the press
that your company

26:11.738 --> 26:13.205
is under criminal investigation,

26:13.239 --> 26:14.306
your government contracts--

26:14.340 --> 26:15.742
they might dry up
pretty darn fast.

26:15.775 --> 26:16.743
What do you think?

26:16.776 --> 26:17.910
TERRY: Feds don't like scandals.

26:17.944 --> 26:18.745
You take a moment,

26:18.778 --> 26:20.212
think about it.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.148
( sighs )

26:31.891 --> 26:34.393
Jonas had no right
doing what he did.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.762
No?

26:35.795 --> 26:38.164
The idea of using

26:38.197 --> 26:39.331
statistical analyses

26:39.365 --> 26:43.335
to predict human performance
originated

26:43.369 --> 26:44.370
in this company.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.405
But he didn't see it that way?

26:46.438 --> 26:49.642
He refused
to provide algorithms to us

26:49.676 --> 26:54.280
unless we gave him a percentage
of the license fees we charge

26:54.313 --> 26:56.749
for the use of our software.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.350
And this time I bet
you refused.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.653
I had no intention
of being extorted

27:00.687 --> 27:02.421
by Jonas Hoke or anyone else.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.256
So, you put the surveillance
on him?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.258
I did no such thing.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.260
But after I learned
that he died, I felt

27:08.294 --> 27:11.898
that we were within our rights
to retrieve the research.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.066
So, what,
you called your friend, Reacher?

27:14.100 --> 27:17.369
Look, the point
of all of this is,

27:17.403 --> 27:19.972
I didn't have to steal anything
from Jonas Hoke.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.074
I already owned it.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.309
DON:
Uh-huh.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.311
All right.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.213
We'll be in touch.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.756
So Oliver told you
what Hoke was working on.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.357
That's why
you wanted his people there.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.859
Oliver said Hoke had a program

27:39.892 --> 27:42.261
that could determine
with mathematical certainty

27:42.294 --> 27:43.896
which neighborhoods
would benefit

27:43.930 --> 27:45.698
from public spending
and which ones wouldn't.

27:45.732 --> 27:46.532
Yeah, and you understand

27:46.565 --> 27:48.267
this is about justifying
taking money

27:48.300 --> 27:50.302
from some certain communities
and giving it to others.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.138
In case you hadn't heard,
we're running

27:52.171 --> 27:53.706
a $10 trillion deficit.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.974
Yeah, I read the papers.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.142
Why throw money away

27:56.175 --> 27:57.376
on state-of-the-art
lab facilities

27:57.409 --> 27:58.978
for kids who have no potential?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.346
That's right.
Why even give them books?

28:02.414 --> 28:03.549
Oliver asked me

28:03.582 --> 28:06.418
if such a program would be
of value to the government.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.954
I believed it would.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.422
So you put the surveillance
in Hoke's house?

28:10.456 --> 28:12.725
No.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.327
You wouldn't tell me
if you did, would you?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.730
I understand you haven't turned
the data you got

28:17.764 --> 28:20.066
from Hoke's computer over
to The Lorman Group yet.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.134
Yes, that's right, and I don't
have any intention of it.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.002
Oh, you realize,

28:23.035 --> 28:24.804
I'll just have my boss
call your boss.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.939
These relationships go way
beyond the two of us, Eppes.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.240
Part of a homicide
investigation.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.209
There's no telling when
it might become available,

28:30.242 --> 28:31.377
but you go ahead,

28:31.410 --> 28:32.578
you make your call.

28:32.611 --> 28:35.381
We did not place surveillance
inside Jonas Hoke's house.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.450
DAVID: So, if it wasn't us, and
it wasn't Oliver's people,

28:38.484 --> 28:39.285
who was watching Hoke?

28:39.318 --> 28:42.755
Well, whoever it was,
it's clean.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.857
No prints,
no identifying signature.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.759
Any idea how they
could have done it?

28:46.793 --> 28:48.795
Well, the alarm company runs
a phone line

28:48.828 --> 28:49.728
through the touch pad.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.964
Whatever system was used
to spy on Hoke was

28:51.998 --> 28:54.400
piggybacked
onto the security system.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.836
So, it was a listening device?

28:56.869 --> 28:59.438
Some sort of audio would be
my guess, but it's hard to tell

28:59.471 --> 29:00.907
without the actual device.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.508
Wait a minute. Hold that screen

29:02.541 --> 29:03.976
right there.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.144
Don,
take a look at this.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.378
This is
the manufacturers' list

29:06.412 --> 29:07.880
for the alarm system,
right?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.448
- Mm-hmm.
- This is the serial number

29:09.481 --> 29:11.283
for that unit--
the unit in Hoke's house.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.986
Take a look at who bought it.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.354
Grodin Construction.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.923
Aha. The boyfriend.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.090
Yup.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.870
Take it to four.

29:30.903 --> 29:31.938
MAN:
Okay.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.472
GRODIN:
You two again.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.808
Yep...
with more questions.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.543
I don't know what else
I can tell you.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.011
Why don't you tell us
about the bug

29:39.045 --> 29:40.446
you planted
in Jonas Hoke's house?

29:40.479 --> 29:42.148
DAVID: You know, for a while
there,

29:42.181 --> 29:44.016
I was thinking Gail
was the victim in all this.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.918
I didn't do anything wrong.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.652
No?

29:46.685 --> 29:47.486
Don't tell me
this is the part

29:47.519 --> 29:48.287
where you say
that she did it all?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.522
Look, neither of us did
anything.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.590
DON:
Well, we still got

29:51.623 --> 29:54.226
a dead body and an alarm system
that was bugged--

29:54.260 --> 29:56.996
an alarm system
that you installed.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.965
Gail's lawyer asked me to help
her guy

29:58.998 --> 30:01.333
put a wire or something
into Jonas's house,

30:01.367 --> 30:02.401
but that's it.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.435
That's all I did.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.938
DAVID: Turn around. Let's go.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.011
DAVID:
Last time we spoke,

30:12.044 --> 30:13.445
you weren't exactly
forthcoming

30:13.479 --> 30:14.546
about your relationship

30:14.580 --> 30:15.915
with Lucas Grodin.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.383
In what way
wasn't she forthcoming?

30:17.416 --> 30:20.052
For starters, how about the fact
you never mentioned

30:20.086 --> 30:22.254
you asked him to wire
your husband's house.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.457
The house was never adjudicated
as separate property,

30:25.491 --> 30:27.426
so therefore whatever
monitoring system

30:27.459 --> 30:28.861
Mrs. Hoke may have placed

30:28.895 --> 30:29.996
in her own house,

30:30.029 --> 30:32.398
she was absolutely
entitled to do so.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.501
I put Jonas through college
and grad school.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.502
- Gail...
- I waited tables.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.004
I did anything I could,

30:38.037 --> 30:40.873
because I believed
we had a future together.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.374
Do you have any idea
what it's like

30:42.408 --> 30:43.943
to have your husband tell you

30:43.976 --> 30:46.345
your contribution
to your marriage isn't of value?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.613
ATTORNEY: I think we should take
a break now.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.015
I'm not finished
with your client, counselor.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.451
You can't prove
Gail did anything.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.420
All I need to make out
conspiracy at this point

30:54.453 --> 30:55.988
is probable cause.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.089
And your boyfriend's
alarm system

30:57.123 --> 30:58.557
gives me exactly that.

30:58.590 --> 31:02.061
It also puts you in possession
of material evidence,

31:02.094 --> 31:03.930
and an obstruction
of justice charge, counselor.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.498
If Jonas were a doctor
or a lawyer,

31:06.532 --> 31:09.068
I'd be entitled
to half of everything.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.203
But everything he had
was inside his head,

31:11.237 --> 31:14.240
so tell me, Agent Sinclair,
how do you get half of that?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.108
Which is why you put
surveillance in his house--

31:16.142 --> 31:17.209
to see what was on his computer.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.012
It was the only way
Jonas would have ever given me

31:20.046 --> 31:21.280
what I was entitled to.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.415
Right.

31:23.449 --> 31:26.552
But after you had
the information you needed,

31:26.585 --> 31:27.886
why'd you kill him?

31:29.455 --> 31:30.923
I didn't kill him.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.460
I could never do
anything like that.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.963
I told you, he was late
with a check.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.097
I went there to get it.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.431
That's when I found him dead.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.467
Gail did not kill her husband.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.301
DAVID:
Forgive me

31:42.334 --> 31:43.335
if I'm not willing

31:43.369 --> 31:44.536
to take your word for it.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.472
ATTORNEY:
You don't have to.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.307
I have the surveillance,
remember?

31:50.676 --> 31:52.578
So is this
an audio file?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.480
No, actually, digital video.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.215
So the device
was a camera?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.416
Not exactly...

31:57.449 --> 31:58.717
It was an antenna.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.586
CHARLIE:
A van Eck Phreak.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.055
But at a far more
sophisticated level.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.656
Wait, what are you guys
talking about?

32:04.690 --> 32:08.094
The wire you found in his house
wasn't for a camera.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.428
It wasn't
for a microphone.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.197
It was for a high-gain antenna.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.198
An antenna?

32:12.231 --> 32:14.066
For what? To pick up what?

32:14.100 --> 32:17.269
Well, with any LCD screen,
liquid crystals

32:17.303 --> 32:19.405
provide an image when energy
passes through them.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.672
The color they become

32:20.706 --> 32:23.442
depends on the amount of energy
that they're exposed to.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.178
When energy passes
through these liquid crystals,

32:26.212 --> 32:28.547
it emits a wave
of electromagnetic radiation.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.982
Dutch physicist
van Eck realized

32:30.016 --> 32:31.717
that with an antenna
and a decoder,

32:31.750 --> 32:32.784
you could both read

32:32.818 --> 32:36.088
the waves and decode them
into a perfect replica

32:36.122 --> 32:38.124
of what someone would be seeing
on their computer screen.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.591
What you're saying is
that the antenna

32:39.625 --> 32:41.460
was able to read and pick up
whatever was

32:41.493 --> 32:42.561
on Hoke's
home computer screen.

32:42.594 --> 32:42.995
That's right.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.130
That is amazing.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.597
Hoke had elaborate safeguards

32:45.631 --> 32:47.366
against
conventional hacking.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.035
Firewalls,
blockers...

32:49.068 --> 32:50.602
Still, nothing
could stop this.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.338
Isn't that around the time
he was killed?

32:52.371 --> 32:53.139
Yeah.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.046
That's where the files
were being erased.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.249
See the zeroes and ones
just flipping around,

33:03.282 --> 33:04.450
back and forth?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.185
So the killer
knew Hoke's passwords.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.986
Too bad he didn't
leave a fingerprint.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.257
Actually, you know what?

33:11.290 --> 33:13.559
I think he did.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.696
DON: All right, so what are we
looking at?

33:17.729 --> 33:20.199
Digital representations of a
pattern of keystrokes.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.800
One taken from Hoke's
computer at home,

33:21.833 --> 33:23.735
one from Hoke's computer
at work.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.705
Now, you know that experts can
distinguish

33:26.738 --> 33:29.075
one person's typing from another
by their rhythm.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.209
Yeah, you mean like Morse Code.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.277
Right.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.645
Telegraph operators
used to recognize each other

33:33.679 --> 33:35.714
by the different ways
they used to tap

33:35.747 --> 33:37.416
into the exact same codes,
like a concert pianist

33:37.449 --> 33:38.650
sitting down to play

33:38.684 --> 33:39.885
a piece of music.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.821
Even though the notes originate
from the sheet music,

33:42.854 --> 33:45.191
the way she plays them
is entirely distinctive.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.358
Now, if another pianist

33:46.392 --> 33:49.561
sits down to play
the same piece of music,

33:49.595 --> 33:52.398
the strength of notes,
the flourishes in rhythm

33:52.431 --> 33:57.269
would make the keystrokes
totally different.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.138
Now, only by seeing them
side-by-side

33:59.171 --> 34:01.673
would you be able to tell
they were different.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.741
See...

34:02.774 --> 34:05.411
Now, I'm sitting here,
and I'm looking at these,

34:05.444 --> 34:07.346
and they look identical to me.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.714
That's because they are, Don.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.151
This is from Hoke's
computer at home.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.120
The keystrokes you're seeing are
passwords

34:14.153 --> 34:16.522
used to tap into Hoke's
sabermetrics files,

34:16.555 --> 34:19.291
made after Hoke
was dead.

34:19.325 --> 34:23.095
This is from Hoke's computer
workstation at the Lorman Group,

34:23.129 --> 34:25.197
made after Hoke was dead.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.633
So then this is the same person

34:27.666 --> 34:29.235
that erased
the files?

34:43.815 --> 34:44.950
DON:
Scott Reynolds,

34:44.983 --> 34:47.253
you're under arrest for the
murder of Dr. Jonas Hoke.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.620
Get your hands up.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.122
( handcuffs snap )

34:50.156 --> 34:51.223
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.591
Anything you say can
and will be used

34:52.624 --> 34:54.426
against you
in a court of law.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.394
Bring him down.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.550
AGENT: All right, sir. Go ahead.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.387
What do you want?

35:21.420 --> 35:23.755
I'm trying to figure out
how you could kill a man,

35:23.789 --> 35:26.658
how you could kill
a fellow scientist,

35:26.692 --> 35:27.826
to steal his work.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.361
Is that why you think
I killed Dr. Hoke?

35:29.395 --> 35:30.296
For the money?

35:31.763 --> 35:33.799
You weren't jealous
of his accomplishments.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.902
His accomplishments...
is that what you call them?

35:40.306 --> 35:42.508
I grew up in West Oakland.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.877
Anyone I grew up with
who isn't dead or in prison

35:45.911 --> 35:48.247
is flipping burgers
or driving a truck.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.182
And it's not too difficult
to guess what Dr. Hoke's formula

35:50.216 --> 35:51.617
would have said about

35:51.650 --> 35:54.353
putting a computer lab
in my high school.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.321
That computer lab

35:55.354 --> 35:56.822
saved my life,
and next year,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.357
it's gonna save
somebody else's.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.458
And killing Dr. Hoke

35:59.491 --> 36:02.294
accomplishes that?

36:02.328 --> 36:05.731
You think it stops there?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.566
In the last century,

36:07.599 --> 36:09.601
the Nazis used
the theory of eugenics

36:09.635 --> 36:11.870
to stop the poor
from reproducing.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.307
Eventually, they justified
just killing the sick ones.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.609
You can't compare
that to this...

36:17.643 --> 36:19.245
Actually, that's
a perfect comparison,

36:19.278 --> 36:20.446
cause what Jonas was doing

36:20.479 --> 36:24.283
was taking away a person's
chance at life.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.484
It's taking away someone's hope.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.254
And I did what I had to do
to stop that before it started.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.823
That makes you a murderer.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.228
Don't you ever wonder
about your own work?

36:38.497 --> 36:40.599
What about my work?

36:42.601 --> 36:44.503
Well, you consult for the NSA,
don't you?

36:46.472 --> 36:47.639
Ah...

36:47.673 --> 36:48.574
of course you do.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.444
So you're gonna tell me
that everything you do

36:52.478 --> 36:54.346
will be used for good
all the time?

36:54.380 --> 36:57.616
What's your point?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.918
Well, you're asking me
how I'm gonna live with myself.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.420
Look in the mirror.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.622
Ask yourself
the same question.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.690
Let's go.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.374
Jonas Hoke's last hurdle.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.276
Oh, yes, his equation

37:24.310 --> 37:25.944
seeking to predict
a person's chance

37:25.977 --> 37:28.847
at success.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.583
He never got to finish it.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.819
I thought maybe I'd
give it a shot myself.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.787
Why?

37:35.821 --> 37:37.756
To what end?

37:37.789 --> 37:42.528
This work is just a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

37:42.561 --> 37:43.762
What do you mean?

37:43.795 --> 37:46.332
Well, Charles,
if we use numbers

37:46.365 --> 37:50.369
to choose who among us
gets opportunity,

37:50.402 --> 37:55.507
then by definition,
those we haven't chosen don't.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.343
I mean,
that's not science.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.478
Well, it's not
good science.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.812
It's like, every year

38:00.846 --> 38:03.048
college football chooses
a national champion,

38:03.081 --> 38:04.783
but they use computers
to determine

38:04.816 --> 38:07.353
which two teams
play for the title.

38:07.386 --> 38:11.490
And every year, invariably,
some team gets left off

38:11.523 --> 38:12.891
that believes, well,

38:12.924 --> 38:14.360
it could have won the game
on the field

38:14.393 --> 38:18.397
if it had just
been given the chance.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.599
I've always believed
that it was my duty

38:20.632 --> 38:22.468
to develop mathematical tools,

38:22.501 --> 38:27.573
and someone else's
to use them wisely.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.409
Could I have been wrong?

38:32.644 --> 38:35.547
The consequence
of our understanding

38:35.581 --> 38:39.451
subatomic particles
was a horrible bomb

38:39.485 --> 38:41.387
that transformed
the world we live in

38:41.420 --> 38:43.422
and a source of energy,

38:43.455 --> 38:47.493
the basis of life-saving
techniques,

38:47.526 --> 38:50.996
and an indispensable
scientific tool.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.565
Science...

38:53.599 --> 38:56.735
you know, science, not this,

38:56.768 --> 38:58.570
but real science,

38:58.604 --> 39:00.406
is discovery, Charles.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.807
It's not invention.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.812
The truths are there,
whether we find them or not.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.414
Listen, I'm gonna
grab a bite to eat.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.481
You want to come?

39:13.419 --> 39:15.454
Okay.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.888
Thank you.

39:20.626 --> 39:21.827
( door closes )
