00:09.956 --> 00:12.948
- Hey, Doctor!
- I'm not a doctor. He's upstairs.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.121
Hold the presses! Hold everything!
Hold it! Get me the state capital.

00:17.197 --> 00:19.222
I've got to talk to the Governor immediately!

00:19.299 --> 00:21.290
It's a matter of life and death.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

01:12.652 --> 01:15.052
- Hello. Mr. Governor?
- Yeah.

01:17.324 --> 01:20.316
<i>The editor of what? The Bugle? Yeah.</i>

01:21.895 --> 01:24.955
What town was that again? Morgan's Creek?

01:25.432 --> 01:28.595
Is that in my state? Never heard of it.

01:28.735 --> 01:29.929
You never heard of it?

01:30.003 --> 01:31.903
By tomorrow morning,
Morgan's Creek will be...

01:31.972 --> 01:33.769
- the most famous town in America.
- The world!

01:33.874 --> 01:36.900
This is the last free phone in town.
Every room has been reserved...

01:36.977 --> 01:38.205
- for 15 miles around.
- Thirty!

01:38.278 --> 01:41.111
A 100 newspapermen are here
and 500 more are expected tomorrow.

01:41.181 --> 01:42.181
A thousand.

01:42.249 --> 01:44.183
- There's a shortage of food, telephones...
- Milk.

01:44.251 --> 01:45.275
- Telegraph wires!
- Liquor.

01:45.352 --> 01:47.377
- Transportation, policemen and everything.
- Tents.

01:47.454 --> 01:51.049
We need a lot of help or they're going
to tear this town up by the roots.

01:51.124 --> 01:52.489
We need state police...

01:52.559 --> 01:55.050
<i>- food, water, beds, blankets.
- Plumbing!</i>

01:55.128 --> 01:57.995
Wait a minute. Take it easy, will you?
What happened down there?

01:58.064 --> 02:00.191
You got a flood or did you strike oil
or something?

02:00.267 --> 02:02.633
- "Did we strike oil or something?"
- Tell him!

02:02.702 --> 02:05.830
- No, Mr. Governor, we did not strike oil.
- Anybody can strike oil.

02:05.906 --> 02:08.340
- We have not got a flood.
- Anybody can have a flood.

02:08.407 --> 02:11.900
- What we've got, Mr. Governor, is...
- You got what?

02:11.978 --> 02:13.605
- Yes, Mr. Governor.
- Shut up! Not you.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.875
Are you sure of your facts?
This is important.

02:15.949 --> 02:17.473
I wish I could be down there myself.

02:17.551 --> 02:21.385
This is a matter of state policy,
state pride, national pride.

02:21.455 --> 02:24.913
Hold the wire a minute. Get on this line,
take everything down in shorthand.

02:24.991 --> 02:27.960
Get a map of the state.
Make sure that Morgan's Creek is in it.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.690
If it ain't, maybe we could persuade them
to move over.

02:30.764 --> 02:32.288
- Yes, Mr. Governor?
- Shut up! Not you.

02:32.365 --> 02:35.334
Get me all the newspapermen.
I want to speak to the radio stations.

02:35.402 --> 02:37.996
- What happened?
- Things like this gotta be guided.

02:38.071 --> 02:40.869
Get right down to Morgan's Creek,
buy up a few choice corners...

02:40.941 --> 02:44.672
some hotel sites, they'll need some.
And the bus franchises will be very valuable.

02:44.744 --> 02:46.644
- Morgan's what?
- "Creek," like a little river.

02:46.713 --> 02:49.648
- A little river should have a big dam.
- Why not? Give me the facts.

02:49.716 --> 02:53.447
It's the biggest thing happening to
this state since we stole it from the Indians.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.919
- Borrowed.
- Who's excited now?

02:54.988 --> 02:58.287
I'll tell you all I know, Mr. Governor.
I started the whole thing.

02:58.358 --> 03:02.351
I was writing my midweek editorial,
I was looking for a subject for it.

03:02.429 --> 03:05.159
<i>I'm rather famous for my editorials
in this part of the state.</i>

03:05.232 --> 03:06.665
He's going to tell us his life story!

03:06.733 --> 03:08.701
And I noticed a few soldiers in the town.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.258
- What an eye!
- What a bore!

03:10.337 --> 03:12.805
<i>It occurred to me
that the girls in the town...</i>

03:12.873 --> 03:17.139
and the soldiers around the towns would
make an excellent subject for my editorial!

03:17.210 --> 03:21.146
All right, let's have it!
We're going to get it anyhow.

03:21.214 --> 03:24.672
I was looking out the window
and there I saw Off. Kockenlocker...

03:24.751 --> 03:26.912
our town constable,
directing traffic as usual.

03:26.987 --> 03:28.852
Keep moving! Can't you see it says "Go?"

03:30.023 --> 03:31.023
Get out of here!

03:31.091 --> 03:34.083
We got to get some dates for that
dance tonight. You got any numbers?

03:34.160 --> 03:36.526
Try the telephone company.
What do you think I am?

03:36.596 --> 03:39.087
- Tough guy, huh?
- Tough enough, rookie!

03:39.165 --> 03:40.632
Where do you get that rookie stuff?

03:40.700 --> 03:43.635
Listen, cookie, I was in France
before you were housebroken.

03:43.703 --> 03:46.035
Now, get off the street
and behave yourselves.

03:46.706 --> 03:49.004
- What's all the trouble?
- There's no trouble.

03:49.075 --> 03:51.839
I just don't like to be talked to
by rookies, that's all.

03:51.912 --> 03:55.473
This is Mr. Kockenlocker, gentlemen,
a sergeant in the other war.

03:55.549 --> 03:58.541
- It's all different now, Ed.
- It's all done with kindness.

03:58.618 --> 04:01.553
Yeah. Come on, get off the street.
Quit blocking the traffic.

04:01.621 --> 04:03.316
- Please.
- Please.

04:03.390 --> 04:06.553
You get the idea, Ed?
It's more psychological.

04:06.626 --> 04:08.423
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

04:09.629 --> 04:11.790
Excuse me, were you looking for some girls?

04:11.865 --> 04:13.696
- We certainly were.
- I know of one.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.701
- I'll bet you do, sugar.
- It's Mr. Kockenlocker's daughter.

04:16.769 --> 04:17.827
That crab?

04:17.904 --> 04:21.805
She's one of the prettiest girls in town.
She works in Rafferty's Music Store.

05:18.999 --> 05:23.060
Come on now, you got to beat it or buy
something before Mr. Rafferty gets after me.

05:23.136 --> 05:25.434
- Will you come tonight?
- Sure, I'll be there.

05:25.505 --> 05:26.563
All right, so long, Trudy.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.370
- Save the first dance for me, will you?
- I'll flip you for it.

05:29.442 --> 05:30.909
Save me the last dance.

05:39.719 --> 05:42.210
- Hello, Trudy.
- Hello, Norval.

05:42.288 --> 05:44.848
I'd like a package
of phonograph needles, please.

05:44.924 --> 05:47.916
- Three Indestructos or 36 Ragons?
- It really doesn't matter.

05:47.994 --> 05:49.985
- I think the Indestructos...
- Thank you, Trudy.

05:50.063 --> 05:54.124
I passed by the lobby. They've got
three pictures playing at the Regent tonight.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.863
I thought that if you weren't doing anything,
considering that I was also free...

05:57.937 --> 06:00.997
I'm awfully sorry, Norval,
but I wouldn't be able to make it tonight.

06:01.074 --> 06:04.373
I promised to go to the dance
for the boys that are going away.

06:04.444 --> 06:08.039
- For the soldiers.
- That's right, Norval. I'm awful sorry.

06:08.114 --> 06:11.572
You'd think they'd give a party sometime
for those who have to stay behind.

06:11.651 --> 06:15.348
They also serve, who only sit and...
Whatever they do, I forget.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.322
I'm sure they do, Norval.

06:17.390 --> 06:22.089
I don't get to see you quite as much
as I used to, or as I'd like to, Trudy.

06:22.162 --> 06:24.062
I'm awfully sorry, Norval.

06:24.464 --> 06:28.560
Naturally, the camps, the canteens and
everything take up a lot of your spare time.

06:28.635 --> 06:29.795
Naturally.

06:29.869 --> 06:32.360
Why don't you come tonight?
The tickets are only 50 cents.

06:32.439 --> 06:35.533
It isn't the 50 cents.
I wouldn't feel right not being in uniform.

06:35.608 --> 06:39.271
- I guess nobody feels good about that.
- It isn't as if I hadn't tried.

06:39.345 --> 06:42.143
- But every time they start to examine me...
- I know.

06:42.215 --> 06:43.978
- And then...
- I know.

06:44.284 --> 06:45.979
- The spots.
- The spots.

06:47.454 --> 06:50.651
- Maybe some other time, Trudy.
- I'd be glad to, Norval.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.087
Good night, Trudy.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.461
You forgot your needles.

06:56.629 --> 07:00.224
It really doesn't matter.
I haven't got a phonograph, anyway.

07:25.759 --> 07:27.249
What are you looking at?

07:27.327 --> 07:29.921
You wasn't thinking
of getting married, was you?

07:29.996 --> 07:31.122
At 14?

07:31.531 --> 07:34.364
I was thinking of going down
to the corner and having a soda.

07:34.434 --> 07:37.562
I don't mean what you were thinking about
right now, I mean generally.

07:37.637 --> 07:40.197
- Generally, yes.
- "Generally, yes" what?

07:40.840 --> 07:44.674
Generally yes, I think about marriage.
What else do you think I think about?

07:44.744 --> 07:48.236
- You do, do you?
- Anybody can think about it, can't they?

07:48.314 --> 07:52.410
It doesn't cost anything to think about it.
It's only when you do it that it costs $2.

07:52.485 --> 07:53.816
What costs $2?

07:53.887 --> 07:57.323
You seem to know a great deal
about a subject far beyond your years.

07:57.390 --> 08:00.223
- Like it says here in the paper...
- That's your subject, Papa.

08:00.293 --> 08:03.592
You introduced it.
If you don't like it, ignore it.

08:20.947 --> 08:23.438
Tell your sister
the house ain't paid for, will you?

08:23.516 --> 08:25.575
She knows that, Papa.
You tell her every day.

08:25.652 --> 08:28.348
Every day ain't enough.
What's she doing up there, anyway?

08:28.421 --> 08:31.254
- Getting ready for the party.
- Getting ready for what party?

08:31.324 --> 08:34.691
The dance, Papa.
You've got to kiss the boys goodbye.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.128
It's a farewell party. A military affair.

08:49.843 --> 08:51.868
- Good night, Papa.
- Just a moment!

08:51.945 --> 08:54.709
What is this military
kiss-the-boys-goodbye business...

08:54.781 --> 08:56.715
and where is it to be transacted?

08:56.816 --> 08:59.284
Just like they always do,
in the church basement...

08:59.352 --> 09:02.378
then the country club
and then kind of... Like that.

09:02.455 --> 09:04.582
- Like what?
- That's all.

09:04.991 --> 09:07.084
- Good night, Papa.
- Just a minute!

09:07.160 --> 09:10.652
- What happens after the country club?
- Then they bring you home.

09:11.030 --> 09:14.466
Yeah, by way of Cincinnati
with a side trip through Detroit!

09:14.534 --> 09:16.434
I was a soldier, too, in the last war.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.699
But, Papa, I've already promised
and I'm all dressed up.

09:19.772 --> 09:22.172
You can go get undressed.
It says here in the paper...

09:22.275 --> 09:23.275
But, Papa...

09:23.343 --> 09:26.904
People aren't as evil-minded as they
used to be when you were a soldier, Papa.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.414
When I want any advice out of you,
I'll ask for it.

09:29.482 --> 09:30.642
- And you'll get it.
- Yeah?

09:30.717 --> 09:32.082
I wish Mama was here.

09:32.151 --> 09:35.416
So do I, believe me.
But she ain't. Daughters.

09:35.922 --> 09:37.856
So, as your father and mother combined...

09:37.924 --> 09:41.257
I'm here to tell you that
you ain't going on no more military parties.

09:41.327 --> 09:43.659
Read what it says here in the paper!

09:50.870 --> 09:54.897
If you don't mind my mentioning it, Father,
I think you have a mind like a swamp.

09:54.974 --> 09:56.066
What!

09:58.978 --> 10:01.446
- Aren't you going out tonight?
- No, ma'am.

10:02.348 --> 10:04.077
I thought you were going to the picture.

10:04.150 --> 10:07.051
I thought I would,
and then I figured I wouldn't.

10:10.423 --> 10:12.789
Isn't there a dance or something tonight?

10:12.859 --> 10:14.554
For the soldiers.

10:18.131 --> 10:19.621
I'm sorry, Norval.

10:19.699 --> 10:21.826
If they don't want me, they don't want me.

10:21.901 --> 10:24.369
Couldn't the doctor
give you something to calm you?

10:24.437 --> 10:28.168
Just long enough for the examination,
like whiskey or something?

10:28.241 --> 10:31.039
I'm perfectly calm. I'm as cool as ice.

10:31.744 --> 10:34.235
I start to figure maybe they won't take me...

10:34.314 --> 10:38.580
and some cold sweat runs down the middle
of my back, and my head begins to buzz...

10:38.651 --> 10:41.484
and everything in the middle of the room
begins to swim...

10:41.554 --> 10:43.818
and I get black spots in front of my eyes...

10:43.890 --> 10:45.983
and they say I've got
high blood pressure again.

10:46.059 --> 10:48.118
And all the time I'm cool as ice!

10:49.062 --> 10:52.088
- Don't get so excited, Norval.
- Who's excited?

10:53.299 --> 10:55.267
Hello. Yes.

10:57.370 --> 10:59.395
Gee, that's swell, Trudy.

11:00.606 --> 11:02.506
Kind of a lucky break, huh?

11:02.809 --> 11:06.176
I certainly appreciate you calling me
right away. I'll be right over.

11:06.245 --> 11:08.008
Goodbye. Oh, boy!

11:09.182 --> 11:11.241
- Have you got any money?
- Money?

11:11.317 --> 11:13.785
What for? Yeah, I've got plenty. Goodbye.

11:13.853 --> 11:15.946
- Your coat!
- My coat.

11:18.191 --> 11:20.955
- I got it.
- Don't get so excited!

11:25.264 --> 11:27.255
What kind of music is that?

11:33.272 --> 11:34.432
Hello?

11:35.775 --> 11:38.801
Hello, Trudy. Hello, Emmy.
Good evening, Mr. Kockenlocker.

11:38.878 --> 11:41.472
I'm glad you're going to
the picture show with me tonight.

11:41.547 --> 11:43.777
- Who, me?
- I'm very glad to go with you, Norval.

11:43.850 --> 11:47.718
Fine. I don't want to sound unpatriotic
but I'm glad they called that dance off...

11:47.787 --> 11:50.483
- for my sake, I mean.
- It wasn't exactly for your...

11:50.556 --> 11:53.957
- It was just called off.
- Come on, Norval. Good night, Emmy, Papa.

11:54.027 --> 11:56.894
- Be home right after the picture.
- Where else could I go?

11:56.963 --> 11:59.659
- I didn't ask where else...
- There's a new boogie-woogie joint...

11:59.732 --> 12:01.256
- Listen, you.
- Come on, Norval.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.392
Right after the picture.

12:02.468 --> 12:04.663
- Yes, Papa.
- Yes, Mr. Kockenlocker.

12:04.737 --> 12:07.831
Now, what do you know about
this little boogie-woogie joint?

12:07.907 --> 12:09.272
Nothing, Papa.

12:09.342 --> 12:12.869
I just heard you were there,
digging quite a trench.

12:16.249 --> 12:19.776
It was certainly very sweet of you
to come and get me right away, Norval.

12:19.852 --> 12:21.319
The pleasure's all mine, Trudy.

12:21.387 --> 12:24.515
Except to get into the Army,
I can't hardly think of anything...

12:24.590 --> 12:27.058
that gives me as much pleasure
as taking you out.

12:27.126 --> 12:30.459
That's nice to hear. You certainly
helped me out by taking me out tonight.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.998
After I was all dressed up
like a horse and everything.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.661
The pleasure's mine, Trudy.
Not that you look anything like a horse.

12:36.736 --> 12:39.671
- Maybe I should have worn my tuxedo.
- Thank you, Norval.

12:39.739 --> 12:41.832
- You certainly helped me out.
- Any time.

12:42.075 --> 12:44.976
- You really mean that, Norval?
- Really mean what, Trudy?

12:45.044 --> 12:46.511
You'd help me out anytime?

12:46.579 --> 12:50.310
Why, Trudy, that's almost all I live for,
except maybe getting into the Army.

12:50.383 --> 12:53.819
I can't think of anything that
makes me more happy than helping you out.

12:53.886 --> 12:57.652
I almost wish you'd be in a lot of trouble
sometime so I could prove it to you.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.418
You can prove it tonight.

13:00.426 --> 13:04.226
I am in a lot of trouble, Norval.
They didn't call off that military dance.

13:04.297 --> 13:06.959
Papa just called it off
as far as I was concerned.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.091
He did?

13:08.167 --> 13:10.328
He probably had pretty good reasons, then.

13:10.403 --> 13:12.735
That's what parents are for,
to listen to their advice.

13:12.805 --> 13:15.239
That's why I always missed
losing my parents so much.

13:15.308 --> 13:18.300
I know. But he didn't have a good reason.
He's just old-fashioned.

13:18.377 --> 13:20.937
Soldiers aren't like they used to be
when he was a soldier.

13:21.013 --> 13:22.810
You know, all in France and like that.

13:22.882 --> 13:24.509
- Aren't they?
- Of course they're not.

13:24.584 --> 13:27.018
They're fine, clean young boys
from good homes...

13:27.086 --> 13:29.213
and we can't send them off to be killed...

13:29.288 --> 13:31.756
in the rockets' red glare,
bombs bursting in air...

13:31.824 --> 13:33.917
without anybody to say
goodbye to them, can we?

13:33.993 --> 13:35.460
They've probably got their families.

13:35.528 --> 13:38.088
Even if they have, they ought to have
girls and dancing.

13:38.164 --> 13:41.224
How about those who haven't
got any families? How about the orphans?

13:41.300 --> 13:43.996
Who says goodbye to them?
You ought to know about them.

13:44.070 --> 13:47.631
The superintendent probably comes down
from the asylum for old times' sake.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.799
Norval, I think you're perfectly heartless.

13:49.876 --> 13:53.642
I hope you get into the Army someday
and the last thing that happens to you...

13:53.713 --> 13:56.546
before you sail away,
the last thing you have to treasure...

13:56.616 --> 14:00.450
while you're fighting beneath foreign skies
is a kiss from the superintendent!

14:00.520 --> 14:03.080
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say:

14:03.156 --> 14:06.421
"Trudy, it's your bounden duty
to say goodbye to our boys.

14:06.492 --> 14:09.825
"To dance with them, to give them
something to remember, to fight for.

14:09.896 --> 14:13.832
"I won't take no for an answer, so
I'll drop you off at the church basement...

14:13.900 --> 14:16.391
"take in a movie, then pick you up
and take you home...

14:16.469 --> 14:19.404
"like a chivalrous gentleman
so you won't get in wrong with Papa".

14:19.472 --> 14:21.838
- That's what I want you to say.
- I won't say it.

14:21.941 --> 14:23.602
- Please, Norval.
- I won't do it.

14:23.676 --> 14:25.940
I won't sit through three features
all by myself.

14:26.012 --> 14:28.572
Couldn't you sleep through
a couple of them?

14:28.648 --> 14:31.742
Suppose you get caught?
Where does that put me with your father?

14:31.817 --> 14:34.752
Why should I get caught?
Anyway, I'm not doing anything wrong.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.254
The whole idea sounds
very cheesy to me, Trudy.

14:37.323 --> 14:39.450
I'm not trying to be disagreeable...

14:39.525 --> 14:42.517
but if you want me
as a kind of a false front, a kind of decoy...

14:42.595 --> 14:46.691
I might just as well take you home
right now and say goodbye to you.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.067
That doesn't cut any ice with me.

14:50.236 --> 14:53.603
Go ahead, cry all you like.
I've seen you cry before.

14:56.175 --> 14:59.076
- Stop it, will you?
- I'm not crying for me.

14:59.579 --> 15:04.482
I'm just thinking of those poor boys
going away like poor little orphans.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.917
- You're not the only dame in town, are you?
- That's right, insult me.

15:07.987 --> 15:10.046
I'm not insulting you, Trudy. I...

15:10.423 --> 15:12.118
Where will I meet you?

15:12.191 --> 15:14.785
It doesn't matter now
that you've spoiled everything.

15:14.894 --> 15:17.556
- Doesn't it?
- What time is the third feature over?

15:17.630 --> 15:20.224
About 1: 10, if my seat holds out.

15:20.299 --> 15:23.393
- All right, I'll pick you up at 1: 10.
- Pick me up?

15:23.469 --> 15:24.993
What do you mean pick me up?

15:25.071 --> 15:28.336
Don't you think I ought to take your car?
The boys mightn't have any.

15:28.407 --> 15:29.806
Take my car?

15:29.875 --> 15:32.776
First, you get me out
under false pretenses...

15:32.845 --> 15:35.678
which you never had
the slightest intention of...

15:35.848 --> 15:38.942
Then you want me to sit through
three features all by myself...

15:39.018 --> 15:42.510
and now you want to take my car
in the bargain for a bunch...

15:42.588 --> 15:45.489
Of all the confounded nerve I ever...

15:46.359 --> 15:48.554
All right! Here.

15:48.628 --> 15:51.620
The car's in front of my house.
Is there anything else you want?

15:51.697 --> 15:53.995
How about my gas card?
My money? My watch?

15:54.066 --> 15:56.500
Maybe one of the boys could use it.

15:56.802 --> 15:58.167
What a war.

17:02.702 --> 17:05.637
- Say, I've got a wonderful idea.
- What?

17:05.704 --> 17:07.695
Let's all get married.

17:40.306 --> 17:43.742
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream</i>

18:00.526 --> 18:03.256
The finest bunch of boys I've ever seen.

18:03.929 --> 18:07.160
I want champagne
for everybody in the house.

18:07.700 --> 18:11.727
I'm so sorry. The whole house.

18:23.082 --> 18:25.107
I've got a wonderful idea.

18:30.589 --> 18:34.025
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream</i>

20:09.889 --> 20:13.985
Hello, Norval. It's nice to see you.
How long you've been waiting?

20:14.493 --> 20:18.224
What do you think?
Holy mackerel, you know what time it is?

20:18.297 --> 20:21.164
We had a wonderful time, Norval.

20:21.400 --> 20:25.837
We sang and then we danced
and then we had some lemonade and then...

20:25.905 --> 20:28.840
it's almost as if somebody slugged me
or something.

20:28.908 --> 20:32.036
Isn't that funny?
The next thing I remember...

20:32.444 --> 20:36.175
I was driving down the street
and all of a sudden I said, "Norval.

20:36.882 --> 20:39.214
"Norval must be waiting for me".

20:39.518 --> 20:41.645
I bet I'm a couple minutes late.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.212
- You win.
- I'm awful sorry, Norval.

20:45.658 --> 20:48.388
If there's one thing I despise,
it's people who...

20:49.094 --> 20:51.927
I mean if there's one thing I love,
it's punctual...

20:54.366 --> 20:55.924
People who are on time.

20:56.001 --> 20:58.731
- You've been drinking!
- Who's been drinking?

20:58.804 --> 21:00.465
I never had a drink in my life!

21:00.539 --> 21:02.700
How dare you insinuate I've been drinking?

21:02.775 --> 21:05.266
You certainly don't get
what you've got on lemonade.

21:05.344 --> 21:07.312
- I certainly did.
- All right.

21:07.613 --> 21:10.377
What have you been using on my car,
a pickaxe?

21:10.616 --> 21:12.243
Is this your car?

21:12.451 --> 21:15.443
I was wondering
where I found this old jalopy.

21:16.188 --> 21:19.817
- Where do you suppose I've been?
- I'm sure I don't know.

21:19.992 --> 21:24.486
It's funny, I remember everything perfectly
up to someplace.

21:24.663 --> 21:27.223
We were dancing or something, and then...

21:27.466 --> 21:30.128
I can't remember anymore.

21:30.469 --> 21:33.233
What am I supposed to do now,
take you home?

21:33.305 --> 21:36.240
Naturally, Norval, since I'm out with you.

21:36.308 --> 21:39.937
- What's your father going to say?
- Papa's probably asleep.

21:40.012 --> 21:41.775
We don't have to worry about him.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.280
I suppose you realize
it's 8:00 in the morning?

21:44.350 --> 21:45.874
8:00!

21:46.418 --> 21:49.546
Norval, you shouldn't have
kept me out so late!

21:49.622 --> 21:51.817
I shouldn't have kept you out so late!

21:51.890 --> 21:55.348
- Papa will be very cross with you, Norval.
- He will, will he?

21:55.427 --> 21:59.158
Suppose I tell him I've been waiting
in a picture lobby for you all night?

21:59.264 --> 22:01.664
That doesn't sound like you, Norval.

22:01.900 --> 22:06.496
I've heard a lot of things against you but
I never heard anybody say you were a heel.

22:06.572 --> 22:08.267
Thanks. Move over.

22:10.376 --> 22:13.641
Maybe we could tell him
we'd been in an accident or something.

22:13.712 --> 22:15.907
Wouldn't we have to wreck the car a little?

22:15.981 --> 22:18.074
It could pass the way it is!

22:20.185 --> 22:23.313
Maybe we went for a ride after the movie
and had a flat.

22:23.389 --> 22:26.756
- It's old, but it's reliable.
- I don't think Papa goes for that one.

22:26.825 --> 22:28.850
- He makes you show the patch.
- He does?

22:28.927 --> 22:30.224
Yeah.

22:30.396 --> 22:34.492
We might have fallen asleep
in the movie and not waked up...

22:34.767 --> 22:38.726
but the best one I can think of is that Papa
had better be asleep when we get there.

22:38.804 --> 22:40.032
You said it!

23:05.431 --> 23:09.299
Thanks a million, Norval.
I'll never forget your kindness.

23:09.568 --> 23:13.664
- I had a wonderful time.
- Can you get in all right?

23:13.772 --> 23:17.708
"Can I get in all right?"
Why, what's the matter with you, Norval?

23:18.043 --> 23:20.443
I never had a drink in my life...

23:20.512 --> 23:23.606
and you talk as if I were
swaffled or something.

23:23.816 --> 23:25.215
Good night!

23:29.988 --> 23:33.321
- Are you hurt, Trudy? Are you all right?
- You stop that!

23:33.926 --> 23:35.518
Norval, you stop!

23:35.961 --> 23:39.658
- You're playing too rough.
- And what kind of a game is this?

23:40.099 --> 23:41.498
Hello, Papa.

23:41.567 --> 23:45.298
We were just kidding around a little
before saying good night.

23:45.370 --> 23:46.564
I see.

23:46.972 --> 23:49.406
And what time do you say good night
as a rule?

23:49.475 --> 23:52.569
- Good night, Norval. Thanks for the movie.
- Just a minute, Mr. Jones!

23:52.644 --> 23:55.636
Where have you been with my daughter
till this hour of the morning?

23:55.714 --> 23:58.182
I don't want to hear about
the accident on the way home...

23:58.250 --> 24:00.480
or the flat tire,
or falling asleep in the movies!

24:00.586 --> 24:03.817
- It's not so late, Papa.
- It may not be late where you come from.

24:03.889 --> 24:06.153
- Stop it, Papa!
- Why don't you say something?

24:06.225 --> 24:09.353
Don't make so much noise, Papa.
You'll wake up the whole neighborhood.

24:09.428 --> 24:12.363
Will you get back in the house?
I'll give you one more chance.

24:12.431 --> 24:15.161
- He's going to explode, Papa!
- Flat tire!

24:15.234 --> 24:17.065
We fell asleep in the movies!

24:17.136 --> 24:20.230
That's all I wanted to know.
I'll flat tire you, you flat tire!

24:20.305 --> 24:22.705
Stop it, Papa! Beat it, Norval!
Trip him, Emmy!

24:24.209 --> 24:25.699
Beat it, Norval!

24:38.123 --> 24:40.990
- Good morning, Mr. Shottish.
- Good morning, Norval.

24:41.226 --> 24:43.091
Been out on a little party?

24:46.498 --> 24:48.466
Yes, sir. You know how it is.

24:49.001 --> 24:50.491
I certainly do.

24:57.609 --> 24:59.634
All right, step lively, men.

24:59.711 --> 25:01.645
Catch those bags up there. That's it.

25:01.814 --> 25:04.408
So long, Lefty.
It's a swell town you got here.

25:04.483 --> 25:05.541
Take care of yourselves.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.016
- Swell girls.
- Swell party.

25:07.085 --> 25:10.577
- How can you feel so good this morning?
- I never felt better in my life.

25:10.656 --> 25:12.146
Why shouldn't we feel good?

25:12.224 --> 25:14.886
If I drunk that much lemonade,
I'd be sour for a week.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.224
Puts my teeth on edge to think of it.

25:17.296 --> 25:19.355
- Any prisoners, Sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.

25:19.464 --> 25:21.932
Sunday morning
and not a stiff in the guardhouse.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.797
Fine. Psycho-lology.

25:24.336 --> 25:27.328
But I still can't understand
how you could stay out so late...

25:27.406 --> 25:30.807
- no matter how much fun you had.
- I can't figure that out, either.

25:30.876 --> 25:35.540
I remember everything perfectly
up to someplace we were dancing.

25:36.415 --> 25:39.816
The next thing I remember,
I was driving down Main Street...

25:39.885 --> 25:41.944
and Norval was waiting.

25:42.087 --> 25:44.681
You didn't go to sleep somewhere
or something?

25:44.756 --> 25:47.987
I don't think so.
You know me, I never get tired.

25:49.628 --> 25:54.588
Did somebody say something about,
"let's all get married," or something?

25:55.234 --> 25:57.498
- No.
- Or did I dream it?

25:59.538 --> 26:01.028
Yes, they did!

26:01.607 --> 26:06.408
And some of those poor dumb kids
thought that would be a wonderful idea.

26:06.478 --> 26:07.638
No!

26:08.447 --> 26:11.575
Can you imagine getting hitched up
in the middle of the night...

26:11.683 --> 26:16.347
with a curtain ring to somebody that's
going away that you might never see again?

26:16.788 --> 26:19.655
You don't suppose any of them
were dumb enough to...

26:20.359 --> 26:21.621
Trudy?

26:22.828 --> 26:24.921
What's that on your finger?

26:25.864 --> 26:27.195
You didn't...

26:30.936 --> 26:32.528
Trudy!

26:34.940 --> 26:37.238
Are you sure you can't remember his name?

26:37.309 --> 26:40.745
How can I remember his name
when I can't even remember...

26:42.614 --> 26:44.206
Wait a minute.

26:49.855 --> 26:53.347
I remember I danced with a tall, dark boy...

26:53.425 --> 26:55.120
with curly hair...

26:55.894 --> 26:58.590
and a little short one with freckles...

26:59.865 --> 27:03.460
and a big fat blond one who sang in my ear.

27:04.036 --> 27:07.130
But if I married any of those
it would have been the tall, dark one...

27:07.205 --> 27:09.696
- with the curly hair, don't you think?
- That's a big help.

27:09.775 --> 27:11.299
All we've got to do is line up...

27:11.376 --> 27:14.812
all the curly-haired men in the Army
and the Navy and the Marine Corps...

27:14.913 --> 27:16.574
It had a "Z" in it.

27:16.648 --> 27:19.082
- His hair?
- No, his name, foolish.

27:19.484 --> 27:22.976
Like Ratzkiwatzki, Pvt. Ratzkiwatzki...

27:24.156 --> 27:26.056
or was it Zitzkiwitzki?

27:26.658 --> 27:30.754
- With a name like that I'd forget him.
- Now you knocked it out of my head!

27:31.430 --> 27:33.330
What's the matter with us?

27:33.398 --> 27:35.696
If you got married,
you must have given your name.

27:35.767 --> 27:38.759
Now all we've got to do is find out
where you got the license.

27:38.837 --> 27:42.967
We've got your name, his name, the date
and everything, and there you are.

27:45.744 --> 27:49.077
- I just remembered something else.
- What?

27:49.514 --> 27:52.210
Somebody said,
"Don't give your right name".

27:52.484 --> 27:55.920
But you didn't fall for it?
You told them to go suck a lemon.

27:55.988 --> 27:58.422
You weren't such a corn-fed dope as to...

28:00.025 --> 28:03.552
- What name did you give?
- I don't remember.

28:04.863 --> 28:08.060
Then the guy can't ever find you
even if he comes looking for you.

28:08.133 --> 28:10.601
Then we'll never even know
if you got married.

28:10.669 --> 28:12.102
I hope not.

28:13.105 --> 28:17.166
If you will just follow these instructions
and come in again in about a month.

28:17.709 --> 28:19.540
Thank you, Doctor.

28:22.948 --> 28:24.677
There, there.

28:25.917 --> 28:29.114
You'll find your husband, I'm sure of it.

28:29.688 --> 28:32.987
And if you shouldn't find him...
You will find him!

28:33.358 --> 28:36.759
Thank you, Doctor.
You don't have to tell anybody.

28:37.262 --> 28:39.730
I mean, you won't tell anybody
until I find him?

28:39.798 --> 28:44.292
Of course I won't, Trudy.
I'm a doctor, not a gossip smearer.

28:45.037 --> 28:46.732
Thank you, Doctor.

28:52.611 --> 28:54.602
- Well?
- Well, what?

28:54.780 --> 28:56.805
- How are we doing?
- Great.

28:57.149 --> 28:59.014
Then we're really in a mess.

28:59.084 --> 29:00.847
Not you, just me.

29:01.319 --> 29:03.844
So what? You don't have to cry about it.

29:03.922 --> 29:06.914
You're not the first dumb cluck
who couldn't find her husband.

29:06.992 --> 29:10.155
What with the war and all,
there'll probably be millions of them.

29:10.228 --> 29:12.696
They say they have
much the prettiest babies, too.

29:12.764 --> 29:14.959
He'll come back. He has to come back.

29:15.033 --> 29:16.591
What're you laughing about?

29:16.668 --> 29:19.899
I was just wondering whether
I was going to be an aunt or an uncle.

29:19.971 --> 29:21.336
Stop it, will you?

29:21.406 --> 29:23.670
I'm only trying to make you smile, Trudy.

29:23.742 --> 29:26.609
- Come on, we'll see Mr. Johnson, the lawyer.
- What for?

29:26.678 --> 29:28.873
To find out if you're really married.

29:28.947 --> 29:31.677
You're kind of hard to convince, aren't you?

29:32.150 --> 29:35.244
- Certainly she's married.
- Even with a phony name, Mr. Johnson?

29:35.320 --> 29:39.120
What's the name got to do with it?
Marriage is a matter of fact, not names.

29:39.191 --> 29:40.988
The marriage was celebrated, I presume?

29:41.059 --> 29:42.287
- They usually are.
- I think so.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.454
Since you're here on behalf of a friend
who does not wish to appear...

29:45.530 --> 29:47.998
all I've gotta say is,
she ought to be ashamed of herself.

29:48.066 --> 29:50.296
She's a very nice girl.
It just happened, that's all.

29:50.368 --> 29:52.131
I mean because of her carelessness!

29:52.204 --> 29:55.696
The responsibility for recording a marriage
has always been up to the woman.

29:55.774 --> 29:58.641
If it wasn't for her,
marriage would have disappeared long since.

29:58.710 --> 30:01.770
No man is going to jeopardize his present
or poison his future...

30:01.847 --> 30:04.873
with little brats hollering around the house
unless he's forced to.

30:04.950 --> 30:07.248
It's up to the woman
to knock him down, hog-tie him...

30:07.319 --> 30:10.345
and drag him in front of two witnesses
immediately, if not sooner.

30:10.422 --> 30:12.117
Any time after that is too late.

30:12.190 --> 30:14.715
Your friend doesn't remember
the bridegroom's name?

30:14.793 --> 30:15.851
No, sir.

30:15.927 --> 30:18.623
She used an assumed name. Perfect.
That's really airtight.

30:18.697 --> 30:20.858
- Couldn't you do anything?
- What, for instance?

30:20.932 --> 30:23.059
- Divorce...
- Or sue him for alimony?

30:23.135 --> 30:24.830
Sue who? Annul who?

30:24.903 --> 30:29.840
I practice the law. I'm not only willing, but
anxious to sue anyone, anytime for anything.

30:29.908 --> 30:33.844
They've got to be real people with names,
corpuses, and meat on their bones.

30:33.912 --> 30:35.641
I can't work with spooks.

30:36.314 --> 30:39.283
Your friend doesn't need a lawyer,
she needs a medium.

30:43.288 --> 30:46.121
- Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
- That will be $5.

30:46.725 --> 30:49.990
Which you'll kindly hang onto
and buy flowers with on the happy day...

30:50.061 --> 30:51.551
for your friend, of course.

30:51.630 --> 30:54.428
You don't have to tell anybody,
do you, about our friend?

30:54.499 --> 30:57.229
How could I when I don't even know
who she is?

30:57.302 --> 30:59.031
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

31:05.911 --> 31:07.742
I've gotta get back to the store now, Emmy.

31:07.812 --> 31:10.747
Could you get me a sandwich
and bring it in to me, a Swiss on rye?

31:10.815 --> 31:14.080
Sure. But the way I look at it, it was
a man got our friend in the soup.

31:14.152 --> 31:16.347
- Let a man get her out of it.
- But how?

31:16.421 --> 31:18.514
She could always get married, couldn't she?

31:18.590 --> 31:20.524
How can I get married
when I'm already married?

31:20.592 --> 31:23.060
Don't talk about yourself,
we're talking about our friend.

31:23.128 --> 31:26.529
It's all very well to say she's married,
but when the time comes to prove...

31:26.598 --> 31:28.657
Are you trying to say our friend is a liar?

31:28.733 --> 31:30.894
- Don't talk so loud.
- You better not.

31:30.969 --> 31:34.700
I'm only 14.
My ideas probably aren't any good, anyway.

31:34.773 --> 31:36.673
I was only trying to be helpful.

31:36.741 --> 31:39.574
Our friend could just marry somebody
and then one day...

31:39.644 --> 31:41.168
Sure. One day she could say:

31:41.246 --> 31:43.840
"By the way,
there's something I forgot to mention".

31:43.915 --> 31:46.110
Anyway, I'm already married.
Mr. Johnson said so.

31:46.184 --> 31:49.415
What does he know? He takes in roomers.
Nobody's going to believe it.

31:49.487 --> 31:52.752
Nobody believes good if they've got
a chance to believe something bad.

31:52.824 --> 31:54.257
But that would be bigamy.

31:54.326 --> 31:57.124
How can it be bigamy
if they didn't get your right name?

31:57.195 --> 31:59.459
You never got married.
That was somebody else.

31:59.531 --> 32:01.863
I could ask the other girls
who were on the party.

32:01.933 --> 32:04.868
If they knew, we would have heard about it,
you can bet your life.

32:04.936 --> 32:08.565
You must have slipped away somewhere
and done it quietly like movie stars.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.803
- I wonder what Papa's going to say.
- He probably won't say much.

32:11.876 --> 32:15.812
He'll just haul off and shoot Norval
so full of holes, he'll look like Swiss cheese.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.939
That was a Swiss on rye you wanted,
wasn't it?

32:18.016 --> 32:20.507
- Norval? Where does he fit in?
- He took you out, didn't he?

32:20.585 --> 32:23.577
He brought you home, didn't he?
At 8:00 in the morning, didn't he?

32:23.655 --> 32:25.816
He fits like the skin on a wienie.

32:25.890 --> 32:28.120
Poor Norval. We'd better warn him.

32:28.193 --> 32:31.026
- We'd better marry him.
- Marry him?

32:31.096 --> 32:32.927
How can you say such things, Emmy?

32:32.998 --> 32:35.330
What's the matter with you?
He was made for it.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.665
Like the ox was made to eat
and the grape was made to drink.

32:38.737 --> 32:40.898
I'll get you the Swiss on rye.

32:45.610 --> 32:47.669
I'm certainly glad to see you all again.

32:47.746 --> 32:51.204
For a while there, I thought you were
kind of sore at me, Mr. Kockenlocker.

32:51.283 --> 32:53.308
- Papa's bite's worse than his bark.
- You said it.

32:53.385 --> 32:55.910
Wait till you get married
and have half a dozen daughters...

32:55.987 --> 32:59.218
and see how you feel when some mug
brings them home 8:00 in the morning.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.657
- But, Papa, you only have two daughters.
- That's plenty.

33:01.726 --> 33:03.853
They're a mess
no matter how you look at them.

33:03.928 --> 33:06.328
A headache till they get married,
if they get married...

33:06.398 --> 33:07.956
- and after that they get worse.
- Pudding?

33:08.033 --> 33:09.398
Either they leave their husbands...

33:09.467 --> 33:12.300
and come back with four children
and move into your guest room...

33:12.370 --> 33:15.567
or their husband loses his job
and the whole caboodle comes back.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.734
Or else they're so homely
you can't get rid of them at all...

33:18.810 --> 33:21.108
and they hang around the house
like Spanish moss...

33:21.179 --> 33:23.306
and shame you into an early grave.

33:23.381 --> 33:26.646
I guess it's a good thing
I didn't have any designs on you.

33:26.718 --> 33:29.846
The way Papa kept talking about
marriage and all.

33:29.921 --> 33:33.220
If you had any designs, they wouldn't
be on me much anyway, I guess.

33:33.291 --> 33:36.783
I guess they would be, if I had any.

33:36.861 --> 33:40.524
Yes, but you haven't. That's what I mean.
Like the night of the party...

33:40.598 --> 33:42.998
you could have stayed
and gone to the show with me...

33:43.068 --> 33:45.832
- but instead, you didn't.
- I'm sorry I didn't, Norval.

33:45.904 --> 33:48.270
- No fooling?
- No fooling.

33:48.740 --> 33:51.470
I wouldn't have got
your car nicked up or anything.

33:51.543 --> 33:53.374
It was only for the boys.

33:53.445 --> 33:54.639
I know.

33:55.213 --> 33:58.444
You can't expect a girl to see much
in a civilian these days...

33:58.516 --> 34:00.347
even an unwilling civilian.

34:00.418 --> 34:03.387
If they had uniforms for them,
it might be a little different.

34:03.455 --> 34:06.618
- I'm not so crazy about uniforms.
- You're not?

34:07.592 --> 34:09.219
I'd give anything to wear one.

34:09.327 --> 34:10.885
That's because you're a man.

34:10.962 --> 34:14.056
Lots of women wear them, too,
like those WACos.

34:14.933 --> 34:16.992
Woman's place is in the home.

34:17.534 --> 34:21.494
That sounds kind of old-fashioned
and domestic coming from you, Trudy.

34:21.572 --> 34:25.339
Sometimes you just naturally feel
old-fashioned and domestic, Norval.

34:25.577 --> 34:28.068
I guess no girl ever gets away
from it, really.

34:28.146 --> 34:31.672
She thinks she is, and then one day,
something happens...

34:32.250 --> 34:34.150
and she finds out she isn't.

34:34.552 --> 34:37.214
Something like what, Trudy?

34:37.455 --> 34:40.514
Something like falling in love,
maybe, or something.

34:40.592 --> 34:42.719
Why, Trudy!

34:43.194 --> 34:44.717
If I didn't know you so well...

34:44.795 --> 34:47.264
and know that nothing could be further
from your mind...

34:47.331 --> 34:51.234
a fellow would almost swear
you were giving him a hint.

34:51.302 --> 34:53.031
Would that be so terrible?

34:53.103 --> 34:55.368
Terrible! It'd be marvelous!

34:56.040 --> 34:57.905
How much of a hint would you need?

34:57.976 --> 35:00.774
Why, Trudy! I...

35:01.045 --> 35:02.979
Norval, remember your blood pressure.

35:03.047 --> 35:06.210
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you
just before you said...

35:06.284 --> 35:08.047
whatever you're getting ready to say.

35:08.119 --> 35:09.381
Don't worry about me.

35:09.454 --> 35:13.220
It's only the surprise of realizing that
what you've been dreaming about...

35:13.291 --> 35:15.953
I mean, what you've been thinking about
all these...

35:16.027 --> 35:20.464
It's not only not impossible,
but even totally...

35:25.036 --> 35:27.163
Trudy, will you marry me?

35:27.238 --> 35:29.001
Norval, this is so sudden!

35:29.073 --> 35:31.633
- Trudy!
- Norval!

35:34.312 --> 35:35.836
Are you all right?

35:37.081 --> 35:39.777
- What happened this time?
- Nothing, Papa.

35:39.851 --> 35:42.251
- Norval just took a little fall.
- Come on, Papa.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.185
Don't tear the house down. It ain't paid for.

35:44.255 --> 35:47.349
- She knows that, you tell her twice a day!
- Twice today ain't enough.

35:47.425 --> 35:50.258
- I'm sorry I was so clumsy.
- That's all right.

35:55.099 --> 35:57.624
- Are you comfortable?
- Fine, thanks.

36:00.171 --> 36:03.163
Say, did I just propose to you or something?

36:03.241 --> 36:05.766
- Yes, you did, Norval.
- How did I come out?

36:05.844 --> 36:08.472
- It was so sudden.
- So sudden?

36:08.947 --> 36:11.142
What do you mean it was so sudden?

36:11.649 --> 36:15.517
How can anything be sudden that's gone on
since you were little kids together?

36:15.653 --> 36:17.245
Almost since I can remember.

36:17.322 --> 36:20.985
I can tell you what dress you wore
at the first Fourth of July party...

36:21.059 --> 36:23.789
and you weren't hardly any bigger
than the firecrackers.

36:23.895 --> 36:27.524
Then you remember the church lawn party
when you sat in the apple butter...

36:27.599 --> 36:29.032
and they blamed me for it?

36:29.100 --> 36:32.069
Then later, at high school,
when I took all kinds of subjects...

36:32.136 --> 36:35.970
I didn't give a hoot about,
it was just to be near you, Trudy.

36:36.741 --> 36:39.539
The cooking wasn't so bad, but the sewing!

36:40.712 --> 36:43.272
And then the older I got, the uglier I got.

36:43.348 --> 36:46.340
When I was a kid they said,
"He'll grow out of it".

36:46.951 --> 36:50.751
But I guess a face like mine,
you just can't grow out of so easy.

36:51.055 --> 36:53.216
It's like it's cast in iron.

36:54.158 --> 36:55.819
So I really didn't blame you...

36:55.927 --> 36:59.419
when you began looking at
the personality kids with the Greek profiles...

36:59.497 --> 37:00.862
and the curly haircuts.

37:00.932 --> 37:02.991
- I did not!
- I didn't blame you.

37:03.067 --> 37:06.264
I even bought a thing once for my nose
but it kept me awake nights...

37:06.337 --> 37:08.737
except once when I almost smothered.

37:09.774 --> 37:11.537
It was only for you.

37:11.609 --> 37:14.305
It's always been for you
and nobody but you.

37:14.913 --> 37:18.849
That's what I went into the bank for,
to get rich and to buy you things someday.

37:18.917 --> 37:20.942
Anything your heart desired.

37:22.220 --> 37:26.850
And then it began to look as if everything
I ever hoped for wasn't going to be.

37:27.025 --> 37:29.550
You had less and less time for me...

37:30.495 --> 37:33.157
and then not having a uniform and all.

37:33.798 --> 37:37.632
But now, Trudy, now that everything
in the world is right here beside me...

37:37.702 --> 37:42.537
everything I've ever dreamed of, to have
and to hold, to cherish and to protect...

37:44.309 --> 37:47.244
- how can you say it's so sudden?
- Norval!

37:47.979 --> 37:51.107
- Why, Trudy, what's the matter?
- I can't do it to you, Norval!

37:51.182 --> 37:53.616
Trudy, if I've said anything
to hurt your feelings...

37:53.685 --> 37:56.586
- I wouldn't hurt your feelings.
- I can't do it, Norval!

37:56.654 --> 37:58.679
You can't do what to me, Trudy?

37:58.756 --> 38:00.951
What have you done to my daughter now?

38:01.025 --> 38:04.222
- Papa! Please, the neighbors!
- What have you done to her?

38:04.395 --> 38:07.626
- Papa, please. It wasn't his fault!
- Then what are you crying about?

38:07.699 --> 38:10.634
- I can cry if I want to!
- I'm gonna give you one more chance!

38:10.702 --> 38:12.135
Papa, please!

38:14.505 --> 38:17.303
Papa, can't you learn to be
a little more refined?

38:17.375 --> 38:18.603
Refined?

38:22.780 --> 38:24.771
- How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

38:24.849 --> 38:27.977
- It doesn't matter about me.
- Thank you, Norval.

38:28.086 --> 38:29.849
What made you cry?

38:30.989 --> 38:32.547
I'm sorry.

38:32.757 --> 38:34.782
Was it the thought of marrying me?

38:34.859 --> 38:37.089
Yes, but not the way you think.

38:38.529 --> 38:41.054
I'm in terrible trouble, Norval...

38:42.066 --> 38:44.466
and somehow I just naturally turned to you.

38:44.535 --> 38:46.526
Like you said that night, you remember?

38:46.604 --> 38:50.301
You almost wished I'd be in terrible trouble
so you could help me out of it?

38:50.375 --> 38:53.310
- That's right.
- You certainly got your wish.

38:53.911 --> 38:56.641
I don't suppose
you'd want to help me out again.

38:56.714 --> 38:59.706
I mean, the idea might not
appeal to you entirely.

38:59.784 --> 39:02.309
- Where's the party tonight?
- What?

39:02.387 --> 39:03.547
No.

39:03.821 --> 39:07.848
That party I went to was enough of a party
for me for quite a while.

39:07.925 --> 39:11.292
That was kind of a party to end all parties,
if you get what I mean.

39:11.362 --> 39:13.592
Trudy, you said
you had such a wonderful time.

39:13.665 --> 39:17.192
I did, in a way, but some kind of fun
lasts longer than others...

39:17.268 --> 39:20.328
- if you get what I mean.
- I'm not sure that I do, Trudy.

39:20.538 --> 39:23.063
Maybe I can find a better way
to explain it to you.

39:23.141 --> 39:24.267
Maybe you can.

39:24.342 --> 39:27.470
When you asked me to marry you, Norval,
did you really mean it?

39:27.545 --> 39:28.978
Of course I did.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.208
Could you think of any reason
why you wouldn't want to marry me?

39:32.316 --> 39:35.843
What would I do with such a reason?
I do want to marry you.

39:36.421 --> 39:38.013
I can't do it to you, Norval!

39:38.089 --> 39:40.489
Now we're right back where we started.

39:40.558 --> 39:44.016
- Norval, can you keep a secret?
- Of course I can.

39:44.095 --> 39:47.155
Cross your heart and hope to die,
boil in oil and stew in lye?

39:47.231 --> 39:50.291
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Boil in oil and stew in lye?

39:50.368 --> 39:52.495
- Sure.
- I'm married.

39:52.570 --> 39:54.265
You're married. You're what?

39:54.338 --> 39:57.239
- Norval! Don't get so excited!
- But, Trudy, you said...

39:57.308 --> 39:58.741
Excuse me.

39:58.810 --> 40:01.301
I thought for a minute there
you said you were married.

40:01.379 --> 40:05.076
- I did say I was married.
- You did say you were married!

40:05.783 --> 40:09.082
Trudy, you... The spots!
...said you were married!

40:09.153 --> 40:12.281
- It happened that night.
- It happened that night?

40:13.357 --> 40:16.417
- You mean the night you were out with me?
- That's right.

40:16.494 --> 40:18.462
Trudy, that's the terriblest thing I ever...

40:18.529 --> 40:20.929
How could you do... The spots!
...to me, Trudy?

40:20.998 --> 40:24.297
- That isn't even the worst of it.
- That isn't even the worst?

40:24.402 --> 40:26.893
That isn't even...
What could be worse than that?

40:26.971 --> 40:28.529
You're going to make me cry.

40:28.606 --> 40:31.370
Go ahead, cry. Cry all you like, see if I care!

40:31.442 --> 40:32.739
The spots!

40:32.810 --> 40:34.778
- Who did you marry?
- I don't know.

40:34.846 --> 40:37.474
You don't know!

40:37.548 --> 40:39.277
What do you mean, you don't know?

40:39.350 --> 40:41.716
That's the most ridiculous statement
I ever...

40:41.853 --> 40:44.481
It has a "Z" in it.
His name had a "Z" in it, I think.

40:44.555 --> 40:45.783
I don't know.

40:45.857 --> 40:47.586
I've thought so much about it...

40:47.658 --> 40:50.320
and the more I think about it,
the less I can remember.

40:50.394 --> 40:54.262
Don't tell me to find the name on the
marriage license because I haven't got any.

40:54.332 --> 40:57.859
And don't ask me if I'm sure I'm married,
because I am sure.

40:57.935 --> 41:01.598
How can you be sure if there's no name
on the record?

41:01.672 --> 41:04.505
How can you possibly be...

41:06.210 --> 41:08.474
Trudy, you don't mean...

41:08.746 --> 41:12.045
- That's right.
- The spots!

41:13.417 --> 41:16.853
That's terrible! I feel terrible.

41:17.288 --> 41:20.451
- How do you suppose I feel?
- That's the terriblest thing I ever...

41:20.525 --> 41:23.688
What's your father going to say
when he finds out? You can't...

41:23.761 --> 41:28.164
You haven't any husband...
I mean, any proof. Who's he going...

41:32.170 --> 41:35.071
- The spots!
- I can almost see them myself.

41:35.139 --> 41:37.198
- How can you...
- Norval, take it easy.

41:37.275 --> 41:41.041
- I'm the last person, I tried.
- Norval, try to focus.

41:41.712 --> 41:44.078
- You better take me home, Norval.
- Focus.

41:44.148 --> 41:46.514
- No, home.
- Hocus.

41:54.192 --> 41:55.318
Hey.

41:56.661 --> 41:57.685
Just a minute.

41:57.762 --> 42:00.629
Now, what was all that clowning around
on the front porch?

42:00.698 --> 42:03.826
Don't you know there are times
when a woman doesn't care to talk?

42:03.901 --> 42:05.459
A woman doesn't care to talk?

42:05.536 --> 42:08.027
Only time a woman doesn't care to talk
is when she's dead.

42:08.105 --> 42:10.539
- Where do you get that woman stuff?
- Or to be questioned?

42:10.608 --> 42:11.905
Or be what?

42:13.177 --> 42:14.610
Papa, don't!

42:17.715 --> 42:20.616
- What happened?
- Nothing.

42:20.685 --> 42:22.880
Just Papa pulling his usual stuff.

42:22.954 --> 42:24.854
No, I mean with Norval.

42:27.458 --> 42:29.426
I couldn't do it to him, Emmy.

42:30.094 --> 42:32.062
He was so sweet, honey.

42:32.263 --> 42:36.461
He said he loved me ever since I wasn't
any bigger than a fire hydrant or something.

42:37.034 --> 42:40.970
How he didn't blame me for not loving him
because he was so homely in the face...

42:41.038 --> 42:43.871
and how he went to cooking class
and sewing class...

42:43.941 --> 42:45.340
just to be near me, Emmy.

42:45.409 --> 42:48.537
But he's perfect.
He could do all the housework.

42:50.014 --> 42:52.278
I couldn't do it to him, Emmy.

42:54.018 --> 42:55.986
Why don't you give yourself up?

42:56.053 --> 43:00.012
- You ought to have your brains counted.
- I couldn't do it to him.

43:00.091 --> 43:01.558
We'll have to find something else.

43:01.626 --> 43:04.026
Where are you going to find
another clunk like that one?

43:04.095 --> 43:06.757
There's nothing says you got to have
a husband on a happy day.

43:06.831 --> 43:09.231
- You take like a widow.
- Yes, but a widow had one.

43:09.300 --> 43:10.631
I had one.

43:10.801 --> 43:14.168
You don't have to convince me, Trudy.
I love you.

43:14.338 --> 43:16.636
I know you wouldn't do anything wrong...

43:16.707 --> 43:20.108
except you take after
Papa's side of the family a little.

43:20.344 --> 43:23.802
It would hurt me just as much
as it would you to have you hurt...

43:23.881 --> 43:26.008
and miserable, ashamed and everything.

43:26.083 --> 43:28.517
That's the only reason
I want you to get married.

43:28.586 --> 43:31.077
You can't tell how a town's
going to take things.

43:31.155 --> 43:33.316
A town that can produce schnooks like Papa.

43:33.424 --> 43:36.791
All suspicious and suspecting
the worst in everything.

43:37.361 --> 43:39.852
There are very few dopes like Norval, honey.

43:39.931 --> 43:42.092
You can't use anybody too snoopy.

43:42.166 --> 43:44.259
Then maybe I shouldn't have told him.

43:44.335 --> 43:45.802
You didn't tell him.

43:47.038 --> 43:49.233
- Murder!
- Emmy!

44:00.952 --> 44:02.817
What's going on in there, anyway?

44:02.887 --> 44:05.549
How about a little quiet? Daughters.

44:15.433 --> 44:17.492
- Going to lunch.
- Yes, sir.

44:29.413 --> 44:31.904
- Funny thing happened this morning, Norval.
- Yes, sir?

44:31.983 --> 44:35.111
Mr. Shottish asked me
if you had announced your engagement yet.

44:35.186 --> 44:37.211
- My engagement?
- Yes.

44:37.288 --> 44:40.780
He kind of had a wild idea that
maybe you'd eloped or something.

44:40.858 --> 44:43.122
What would I elope for?

44:43.194 --> 44:45.355
- What are you so nervous about?
- Who's nervous?

44:45.429 --> 44:47.989
- I mean, who's nervous?
- All I mean, Norval, is this.

44:48.065 --> 44:51.262
It isn't any of my business,
what time you get home in the morning...

44:51.335 --> 44:53.496
or how drunk you are
when you do get home...

44:53.604 --> 44:55.731
- but it is the bank's business.
- The bank.

44:55.806 --> 44:56.806
That's right.

44:56.874 --> 45:00.833
A man in a bank is like a fellow crossing
Niagara Falls on a tightrope.

45:00.911 --> 45:04.813
- He cannot be too careful.
- Yes, I get what you mean, Mr. Tuerck.

45:05.116 --> 45:08.574
Fathers taking pokes at you
and all that sort of stuff.

45:08.953 --> 45:11.478
- Very bad for a banker.
- You said it, Mr. Tuerck.

45:11.555 --> 45:13.716
- You said it.
- Remember it.

45:14.558 --> 45:15.684
Yes, sir.

45:28.806 --> 45:30.774
Come on, step lively.

45:31.242 --> 45:33.005
- Hi, Mr. Tuerck.
- Hello, Edmund.

45:33.077 --> 45:34.908
I'm glad to see
they haven't run you down yet.

45:34.979 --> 45:36.776
I'll get it from a horse when I get it.

45:36.847 --> 45:40.442
I heard a rumor that one of your daughters
is getting married. Any truth in it?

45:40.518 --> 45:42.918
- One of my daughters? Who told you?
- A little bird.

45:42.987 --> 45:46.479
We bankers, you know. We have our own
little channels of information.

45:46.557 --> 45:47.854
Congratulations, Edmund.

45:47.925 --> 45:50.860
Maybe you ought to just marry me
and forget the whole thing.

45:50.928 --> 45:52.793
I couldn't do that to you, Norval.

45:52.863 --> 45:56.594
I couldn't let you take the risk of going
to jail for 20 years for bigamy.

45:56.667 --> 45:58.794
You were going to on the front porch...

45:58.869 --> 46:01.633
and you didn't mention anything
about the 20 years...

46:01.705 --> 46:04.003
when I started to propose to you.

46:04.075 --> 46:06.600
I wasn't in love with you then, Norval.

46:07.144 --> 46:09.305
Do you really mean that, Trudy?

46:09.380 --> 46:13.783
I feel very much ashamed of myself
for what I almost did to you, Norval.

46:14.452 --> 46:16.147
What are you talking about?

46:16.220 --> 46:18.984
All you did was give me the chance
I've always wanted...

46:19.056 --> 46:21.149
that I've been waiting for.

46:21.525 --> 46:25.689
To show you how much I love you
and the kind of love I had for you.

46:26.030 --> 46:29.591
- You've got to marry me, Trudy.
- I can't do it to you, Norval.

46:30.901 --> 46:34.337
But I want you to know how much
I appreciate your offer...

46:34.405 --> 46:38.102
and how much I wish I'd known
how sweet you are a little sooner.

46:38.342 --> 46:41.436
I want you to know that
and to remember it always.

46:41.912 --> 46:43.903
It will be my dying wish.

46:44.148 --> 46:45.706
And when they fish me out...

46:45.783 --> 46:49.082
I want you to know that
my last thought was of you.

46:49.153 --> 46:52.350
Fish you out? You mean of the creek?

46:52.456 --> 46:55.948
- It may be the only way.
- What are you talking about, Trudy?

46:56.026 --> 46:58.551
That's the last way,
when everything else has failed.

46:58.629 --> 47:03.464
Before I tried that, I'd try bigamy,
forgery, burglary, anything.

47:03.767 --> 47:07.533
The only awful part about it is that
Papa'd be sure to shoot you then.

47:07.605 --> 47:08.970
Well...

47:11.475 --> 47:14.842
Of course, without you,
it wouldn't matter, anyway.

47:15.679 --> 47:19.513
Thank you, dear.
Maybe we could jump in together.

47:20.684 --> 47:23.710
There's not much water
this time of year, Trudy.

47:24.688 --> 47:28.055
Isn't there a swimming hole
about 10 miles away?

47:28.359 --> 47:31.954
You're not supposed to use your tires
for anything like that, Trudy.

47:32.062 --> 47:35.725
Besides, I'm a very good swimmer
and being a very good swimmer...

47:35.799 --> 47:38.962
they say that whenever
they get in a situation like that...

47:39.036 --> 47:42.597
they just naturally swim right out.

47:42.873 --> 47:45.603
I'm a very good swimmer, too.
I hadn't thought of that.

47:45.676 --> 47:48.201
Well, then, let's forget the creek.

47:49.046 --> 47:51.344
Maybe we could tie rocks around our necks.

47:51.415 --> 47:52.643
Never!

47:54.051 --> 47:58.010
- What's the matter with gas?
- What's the matter with bigamy?

47:58.289 --> 47:59.289
Hey!

48:00.691 --> 48:01.988
Come here.

48:21.712 --> 48:24.078
I want to have a little talk with you.

48:24.215 --> 48:27.480
- With me, Papa?
- No, with your gentleman friend there.

48:27.551 --> 48:29.815
- You go in the house.
- Yes, sir.

48:30.921 --> 48:32.115
Go on.

48:33.390 --> 48:34.618
Sit down!

48:39.263 --> 48:41.356
What are you so nervous about?

48:41.632 --> 48:43.156
Who's nervous?

48:46.904 --> 48:49.532
There's getting to be quite a little talk
in the town.

48:49.640 --> 48:52.609
Where I come from, we don't skulk
around in the bushes, you get me?

48:52.676 --> 48:54.439
- Yes, sir.
- When we gotta cross the street...

48:54.511 --> 48:56.342
we don't crawl through the sewer
to get there.

48:56.413 --> 48:58.677
- Yes, sir.
- When we've got something to say we say it!

48:58.749 --> 49:01.013
- Yes, sir.
- When is the happy event?

49:03.554 --> 49:06.216
I didn't hear exactly what you said.

49:06.290 --> 49:08.383
When are you and Trudy getting hitched?

49:12.796 --> 49:16.732
- What are you laughing about?
- Who me? I'm not laughing.

49:17.368 --> 49:20.030
Just something I heard at the bank today.

49:20.104 --> 49:22.231
You haven't answered my question.

49:23.607 --> 49:25.905
There isn't any idiocy
in your family, is there?

49:25.976 --> 49:27.671
- She won't have me.
- She won't?

49:27.745 --> 49:30.111
- I already asked her.
- You didn't ask her right.

49:30.180 --> 49:32.444
You gotta be more forceful in these matters.

49:33.083 --> 49:35.347
Dames like to be bossed.
Now, you take me...

49:35.419 --> 49:36.511
I did my best.

49:36.587 --> 49:38.282
You can do better. You better do better.

49:38.355 --> 49:40.687
- All you can do is ask.
- We accept.

49:41.091 --> 49:42.149
You're in.

49:42.426 --> 49:46.692
Now, wait a minute. There might be
a couple of reasons, a couple of details.

49:46.764 --> 49:50.791
You can settle the details up between you.
All I'm interested in is results.

49:50.868 --> 49:52.995
I'm a man who looks at things broadly, see?

49:53.070 --> 49:55.368
- I'm a man who...
- Now, wait...

49:56.140 --> 49:57.471
I'll go!

50:02.112 --> 50:04.205
I almost forgot. Congratulations!

50:06.116 --> 50:07.242
Thanks.

50:32.476 --> 50:34.706
- What was that shooting?
- Nothing.

50:34.778 --> 50:38.509
He was just practicing.

50:40.951 --> 50:45.888
- It frightened me!
- There's nothing to be frightened about.

50:47.358 --> 50:50.418
Only, he wants us to get married
right away, Trudy...

50:50.494 --> 50:53.190
- and he was very firm about it.
- Why?

50:53.263 --> 50:55.561
You mean because you brought
me home the other morning?

50:55.632 --> 50:58.465
You mustn't start arguing, Trudy.
The whole town's talking.

50:58.535 --> 51:00.526
You're in a terrible spot, Trudy.

51:00.604 --> 51:03.164
You've either got to marry me right away...

51:03.240 --> 51:06.403
or tell him the whole truth...

51:06.477 --> 51:08.411
which would be terrible.

51:08.479 --> 51:11.642
- I can't do it to you, Norval.
- What are you talking about, Trudy?

51:11.715 --> 51:14.980
It's just a lucky break for me.
I tried to tell you that.

51:15.052 --> 51:16.815
You're just giving me an opportunity.

51:16.887 --> 51:19.412
But that's bigamy!
I'm already married to Ratzkiwatzki.

51:19.490 --> 51:22.653
I can't keep on marrying people,
no matter how sweet they are.

51:22.726 --> 51:24.091
I've got it!

51:24.161 --> 51:26.391
Norval, don't get so excited!

51:29.733 --> 51:31.894
Wait a minute, Trudy, I've got it!

51:31.969 --> 51:33.800
- Don't get so excited, Norval.
- Who's excited?

51:33.871 --> 51:37.671
This is airtight and watertight.
It's foolproof and almost legal, Trudy.

51:37.741 --> 51:41.074
And when we get through,
you can divorce that gink and marry me.

51:41.145 --> 51:45.309
- Norval, take it easy.
- It's a cinch. It's almost an inspiration!

51:45.382 --> 51:48.818
Now, will you go to the movies
with me tomorrow night, the early show?

51:48.886 --> 51:51.446
- Of course. I'll be glad to.
- That's all there is to it.

51:51.522 --> 51:53.752
I'll get everything ready and I'll go this way.

51:53.824 --> 51:55.792
I don't want to meet your father just yet.

51:55.859 --> 51:58.123
- Norval, wait a minute.
- Don't worry about a thing.

51:58.195 --> 52:01.653
- It's just as easy as falling off a log.
- But, Norval...

52:01.832 --> 52:03.231
Darling!

52:03.300 --> 52:06.827
- Did you break anything, dear?
- Nothing but my back.

52:11.975 --> 52:16.173
Who, me? No. It's for my aunt in the East.

52:16.246 --> 52:20.273
She dropped hers down a rat hole...
A crack in the floor...

52:20.350 --> 52:22.648
so I'm getting this as a surprise for her.

52:22.719 --> 52:25.483
Her finger felt kind of naked.

52:25.556 --> 52:27.854
- I can't do it, Norval!
- But, Mr. Swartz...

52:27.925 --> 52:29.085
They wrote me a letter.

52:29.159 --> 52:32.322
- But it's just to wear around...
- Wool is very scarce.

52:32.396 --> 52:35.991
- "We've got to save it for the soldiers".
- Well, how about cotton?

52:36.066 --> 52:40.059
"Cotton is very scarcer".
It says so in the next paragraph somewhere.

52:40.137 --> 52:42.196
What for do you want
for a uniform for, anyhow?

52:42.272 --> 52:45.105
- I wouldn't want you to tell anybody.
- Norval!

52:45.175 --> 52:48.838
Well, it's just to put...
I mean, to wear around the house.

52:48.912 --> 52:52.177
- When you've always wanted...
- How about an Indian suit with feathers?

52:52.249 --> 52:54.012
That? No, thank you.

52:54.084 --> 52:57.110
- Wait! Just to wear around the house?
- Well, in the yard, maybe.

52:57.187 --> 52:58.779
- I got it!
- You have? You got it?

52:58.856 --> 53:01.017
- It ain't the latest.
- What does that matter?

53:01.091 --> 53:02.388
You got the shoes, too?

53:02.459 --> 53:05.189
I'll even throw in the gun.
For $5 you got the whole works.

53:05.262 --> 53:08.231
And you can play soldier
till your feet wear out.

53:08.298 --> 53:11.563
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Swartz.
- Very kind of you, Norval.

53:11.635 --> 53:13.330
You can have the steel helmet, too.

53:13.403 --> 53:16.497
But that's bigamy just as much as
if you married him as Norval Jones.

53:16.573 --> 53:18.507
No, it isn't. They do it all the time.

53:18.575 --> 53:21.976
When a king wants to get married,
only, he's too busy in his own kingdom...

53:22.045 --> 53:23.842
and he can't get over
to the other kingdom...

53:23.914 --> 53:26.314
and the other king won't send
the princess over C.O. D...

53:26.383 --> 53:28.010
because he doesn't trust the first king.

53:28.085 --> 53:31.953
So they send a kind of a phony bridegroom
over and he marries the princess.

53:32.022 --> 53:36.152
Except, he doesn't really marry her.
It's what they call "marriage by prexy".

53:36.593 --> 53:38.584
I didn't know prexies
could perform marriages.

53:38.662 --> 53:39.788
I didn't either.

53:39.897 --> 53:42.127
- Well, it's bigamy.
- It is not!

53:58.949 --> 54:00.416
Good evening.

54:02.286 --> 54:05.722
I've come to take Trudy to the movies.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.461
- What's so funny about that?
- Nothing.

54:12.663 --> 54:15.962
Shall I tell her I'm here or will you?

54:16.300 --> 54:18.700
What do you want me to do, fire a salute?

54:20.370 --> 54:23.032
Very funny.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.765
- You remember what I told you last night?
- Yes, sir.

54:25.842 --> 54:27.434
- Keep thinking about it?
- Yes, sir.

54:27.511 --> 54:29.342
- Movie is a very good place.
- Yes, sir.

54:29.413 --> 54:31.005
- You can hold hands.
- Sure.

54:31.081 --> 54:32.844
- Snuggle up.
- Fine.

54:32.916 --> 54:37.182
- You get the idea?
- Perfectly.

54:37.287 --> 54:39.084
Do you want me to come
and sit behind you?

54:39.156 --> 54:40.214
No.

54:41.358 --> 54:43.883
Okay. Then, I guess that's about all.

54:44.328 --> 54:45.920
Trudy!

54:49.199 --> 54:51.895
They ain't giving away
a set of dishes tonight, are they?

54:51.969 --> 54:53.869
That must be him. Emmy, get my coat.

54:53.937 --> 54:55.962
- Keep cool, Trudy.
- I'm cool!

54:56.039 --> 54:58.837
- I'm not excited! Hello, Norval.
- Hello, Trudy.

54:58.909 --> 55:01.639
We're going to see some
pretty good movies tonight.

55:01.778 --> 55:04.338
- You said it, Norval.
- Are you gonna start that stuff now?

55:04.414 --> 55:05.972
Well, goodbye, Papa.

55:06.583 --> 55:09.416
- Goodbye, Mr. Kockenlocker.
- Goodbye, Emmy.

55:09.486 --> 55:10.783
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye, honey.

55:10.854 --> 55:14.290
What's all the goodbying for?
They're seeing a couple of bum features.

55:14.358 --> 55:15.757
Three features.

55:15.826 --> 55:17.191
<i>The Bride Wore Purple...</i>

55:17.260 --> 55:20.593
<i>The Road to Reno,
and Are Husbands Necessary?</i>

55:20.664 --> 55:24.623
- And then home! No boogie-woogie!
- Papa, can't you be more refined?

55:24.701 --> 55:26.828
Goodbye and watch your step!

55:27.938 --> 55:29.235
Papa!

55:31.274 --> 55:33.902
What's going on around here, anyway?

55:34.378 --> 55:38.644
- It's about 25 miles.
- I'm going to die before we get there.

55:38.715 --> 55:42.446
There's nothing to be nervous about.
There's a justice of the peace.

55:42.519 --> 55:44.248
- You got the uniform?
- It's in the back.

55:44.321 --> 55:45.788
- And the ring?
- It's in the uniform.

55:45.856 --> 55:48.825
- How do you look in it?
- I don't know. I haven't tried it on yet.

55:48.892 --> 55:52.123
Now, look. There's one thing
we've got to settle on.

55:52.195 --> 55:55.653
- What was his first name?
- You mean Ratzkiwatzki?

55:55.732 --> 55:57.962
- Naturally.
- Does he have to have a first name?

55:58.035 --> 56:00.936
Of course he has to have a first name.
Everybody has a first name.

56:01.004 --> 56:04.167
Even dogs have first names,
even if he hasn't got any last name.

56:04.241 --> 56:07.301
Well, I don't know.
I had an uncle named Roscoe.

56:07.377 --> 56:09.470
- Roscoe! "He eats them alive!"
- What?

56:09.546 --> 56:11.104
That's a snake eater's name!

56:11.181 --> 56:14.776
- Well, it was my uncle's name.
- Well, how about Hugo?

56:14.851 --> 56:16.079
Phooey.

56:16.153 --> 56:17.916
Well, how about Otis?

56:17.988 --> 56:19.046
- That was...
- Phooey.

56:19.122 --> 56:22.114
- That was my father's name.
- I'm sorry.

56:22.192 --> 56:25.684
It doesn't matter. You can call him
Montmorency for all I care.

56:25.762 --> 56:28.424
- What goes good with Ratzkiwatzki?
- Nothing.

56:28.498 --> 56:30.989
How about Ignatz?

56:31.068 --> 56:34.265
Ignatz! You'd have to take
bicarbonate with that one.

56:34.337 --> 56:38.034
Ignatz Ratzkiwatzki. Yeah, that fits all right.

56:38.108 --> 56:39.166
Phooey.

56:39.242 --> 56:41.506
It's all very well to sit there
and say "phooey"...

56:41.578 --> 56:44.809
but I've got to find a first name
before we get there.

56:44.881 --> 56:46.610
All right, Ignatz.

56:49.553 --> 56:53.250
It's funny having almost our first fight
on the way to the altar.

56:53.323 --> 56:55.086
Well, it isn't like having a bad fight.

56:55.158 --> 56:59.754
It's more like people have
when they're picking out a name for their...

57:00.330 --> 57:04.596
You mustn't think about that, Trudy.
Remember what it says in the Bible:

57:04.768 --> 57:08.397
"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof".

57:08.472 --> 57:12.374
And there isn't going to be any evil, Trudy.
Never for you.

57:12.576 --> 57:14.009
Thank you, Norval.

57:14.077 --> 57:17.808
- I bought you something.
- Thank you, Norval.

57:17.881 --> 57:19.849
Please don't do that.

57:20.984 --> 57:24.784
It's just that I feel almost as if
it was me marrying you.

57:24.855 --> 57:27.016
I wish it were, Norval, so much.

57:27.090 --> 57:30.890
- You really mean that, Trudy?
- Of course I do.

57:30.961 --> 57:31.961
Look out!

57:32.395 --> 57:34.625
It doesn't seem to be such a very good fit.

57:34.731 --> 57:37.461
There seems to be
something wrong with it, Norval.

57:37.534 --> 57:39.297
This must be the cavalry or something.

57:39.369 --> 57:41.735
I haven't seen anything
like this around here.

57:41.805 --> 57:42.829
What are those things?

57:42.906 --> 57:45.101
I guess they go around your legs
or something.

57:45.175 --> 57:48.008
Maybe it's a tropical uniform,
like General MacArthur wears.

57:48.078 --> 57:52.174
Well, I never saw any pictures of
General MacArthur looking like this.

57:52.716 --> 57:55.514
- What happened?
- I'm afraid to find out.

57:56.653 --> 57:57.677
Norval.

57:57.754 --> 58:00.188
There seems to be
another seat left, anyway.

58:00.524 --> 58:03.687
- Couldn't you hoist them up a little?
- Be careful!

58:03.760 --> 58:06.092
How many seats do you think
these pants have, anyway?

58:06.163 --> 58:08.393
- I'm sorry.
- Well, how do I look?

58:08.532 --> 58:12.161
Well, you don't look like General MacArthur.

58:19.309 --> 58:22.005
- Good evening.
- We'd like to be married.

58:22.078 --> 58:23.705
Straight ahead, please.

58:31.021 --> 58:32.454
Another army couple, Jake.

58:32.522 --> 58:36.549
Just take it easy.
It'll all be over in a minute.

58:36.626 --> 58:39.424
- I wish it were all over now.
- There's nothing to be nervous...

58:39.496 --> 58:42.659
Good evening. Thinking of getting married?
Good idea.

58:42.732 --> 58:45.257
- The names, please.
- Gertrude...

58:45.335 --> 58:47.462
- How was that again?
- Gertrude...

58:47.537 --> 58:50.973
Take it easy. There's nothing
to be scared of. People do it everyday.

58:51.041 --> 58:54.101
- The bad part comes later.
- Gertrude Kockenlocker.

58:54.177 --> 58:58.238
- K-O-C-K-E-N-L-O-C-K-E-R.
- L-O-C-K-E-R? That's better.

58:58.415 --> 59:00.212
- And yours, young man?
- Ignatz.

59:00.283 --> 59:03.719
Ignatz Ratzki...

59:03.787 --> 59:04.981
How was that again?

59:05.055 --> 59:08.752
- Ignatz Ratz...
- Now, take it easy, will you?

59:09.960 --> 59:14.795
- L-G-N-A-N-A-T-T-Z.
- R-A-T-Z-W-l-Z-K-l-W-Z.

59:14.865 --> 59:15.957
K-Z, what?

59:16.032 --> 59:19.126
- Ratzkiwatzki.
- That's close enough.

59:19.402 --> 59:20.460
Bride's residence?

59:20.537 --> 59:22.368
17 Genessee Street, Morgan's Creek.

59:22.439 --> 59:26.205
Morgan's Creek. Ever been married before?

59:26.443 --> 59:29.310
I said, you ever been married before?
That's a simple question.

59:29.379 --> 59:31.609
- No, sir.
- Groom's residence?

59:33.884 --> 59:37.376
What are you doing down there?
What is the groom's residence?

59:37.454 --> 59:39.445
Where do you live, in a tree?

59:39.522 --> 59:42.514
- Your camp.
- Camp Smum.

59:42.592 --> 59:43.923
Camp what?

59:45.562 --> 59:47.757
- Smum.
- Where is it located?

59:48.431 --> 59:51.764
It's located in Smum County.

59:51.902 --> 59:53.893
- Suppose I just put "U.S. Army"?
- Fine.

59:53.970 --> 59:55.335
- Fine.
- Fine.

59:57.007 --> 59:58.975
- Is there still time?
- Plenty.

59:59.409 --> 01:00:01.036
Now, if the witnesses will ever get here...

01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:03.545
Miss Sally Blair and my wife
will act as witnesses for you.

01:00:03.613 --> 01:00:06.309
Miss Gertrude Kockenlocker
and Mr. Ignatz Ratzkiwatzki Watastki.

01:00:06.383 --> 01:00:09.409
Something like that. Or should that be
Pvt. Ignatz and the rest of it?

01:00:09.486 --> 01:00:10.976
Are you sure that you love each other?

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:13.249
- What do you think they came here for?
- Are they sure?

01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:16.417
Do you want lots of little babies?
And the patter of footsie-wootsies?

01:00:16.493 --> 01:00:18.893
You better lay off
or I won't let you be witness anymore.

01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:20.429
- Let's get down to business!
- Let's.

01:00:20.497 --> 01:00:22.522
Take off your hat. "Ignatz Razly-Wazly.

01:00:22.599 --> 01:00:24.590
"Do you take this woman,
Gertrude Sockenbocker...

01:00:24.668 --> 01:00:26.602
"for your lawful wedded wife
to have and hold...

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.934
"to cherish and keep forever,
till death do you part?"

01:00:29.005 --> 01:00:30.563
- I do.
- "Gertrude Krockendocker.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.507
"Do you take Ignatz Razzby-Wadsby
for your lawful wedded husband...

01:00:33.576 --> 01:00:35.373
"to have and hold, in sickness and health...

01:00:35.445 --> 01:00:37.936
"to love, cherish and keep forever
till death do you part?"

01:00:38.014 --> 01:00:40.141
- I do.
- Then give me the ring.

01:00:41.584 --> 01:00:43.609
Place it on her third finger
and repeat after me:

01:00:43.687 --> 01:00:46.155
- With this ring I thee wed.
- "With this ring I thee wed".

01:00:46.222 --> 01:00:48.884
Then with the authority vested in me
by our sovereign state...

01:00:48.959 --> 01:00:50.790
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:00:55.265 --> 01:00:57.927
That'll be $2, please.
That's all there is to it. Sign here.

01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:00.868
Thank you. That certainly made me nervous.

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:03.497
If you knew what it was like,
it would make you nervouser.

01:01:03.573 --> 01:01:04.631
Jake.

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:08.644
- I've got it, dear.
- Fine. Now, sign there.

01:01:08.979 --> 01:01:11.675
It certainly makes me feel much better.

01:01:11.748 --> 01:01:14.512
There you are.
And a little cookbook goes with it...

01:01:14.584 --> 01:01:17.382
with best wishes from those
who may have to eat the cooking.

01:01:17.487 --> 01:01:21.856
Don't forget the pitty-patter. I always say,
a childless home is like a homeless child.

01:01:22.592 --> 01:01:24.082
Just a minute!

01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:26.827
- Who's Norval Jones?
- Norval!

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:30.332
Lock the door, Mariah!
This man is an abductor!

01:01:42.312 --> 01:01:44.075
Get off my lap! What's the matter with you?

01:01:44.147 --> 01:01:47.048
I've got a right to sit on your lap.
I'm your daughter, aren't I?

01:01:47.117 --> 01:01:49.745
- That's what they told me.
- I'm nervous.

01:01:49.819 --> 01:01:52.720
- What about?
- You don't hear a police siren, do you?

01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:55.883
A police siren? That's a tree toad.

01:01:56.426 --> 01:01:58.451
I keep feeling I hear a police siren.

01:01:58.561 --> 01:02:01.428
How could you hear a police siren
when there ain't one in town?

01:02:01.498 --> 01:02:02.965
I don't know.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.865
I thought I heard it again there.

01:02:04.934 --> 01:02:08.062
How could you hear a police siren when...

01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:12.002
- there ain't one in town?
- What's that, a hoot owl?

01:02:12.242 --> 01:02:13.607
That's a...

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.891
Make way, please.

01:02:34.397 --> 01:02:37.127
- Hello, Papa.
- Trudy!

01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:38.965
What's all this?

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:41.595
What are all you coppers doing in my town?

01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:44.367
- Ever see this man before?
- Certainly I've seen him before!

01:02:44.441 --> 01:02:46.136
What're you doing in the outfit, Norval?

01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:48.609
All, please take notice
his name is Norval, not Ignatz...

01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:50.303
and that is not his regular outfit.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.076
Who said it was? What are they
supposed to have done anyway?

01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:55.845
- You'll find out.
- Go on in the house! Go on.

01:02:55.985 --> 01:02:57.714
Clear out of here, folks. Go on.

01:02:57.854 --> 01:03:01.483
Go on home before I pinch you
for loitering! Get out of here!

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.691
He did what? All right, Edmund,
I'll be right over.

01:03:07.764 --> 01:03:09.994
Norval's in some mess
with the Kockenlocker girl.

01:03:10.066 --> 01:03:12.762
- I don't believe it.
- Nobody asked you to.

01:03:12.836 --> 01:03:15.430
Are you nuts or something?
What's the idea of the get-up?

01:03:15.505 --> 01:03:17.200
What war do you think you're in, buddy?

01:03:17.273 --> 01:03:18.672
The ghost of the AEF.

01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:20.971
Let's see your dog tags, General.

01:03:21.344 --> 01:03:23.574
No more dog tags than feathers on a fish.

01:03:23.646 --> 01:03:25.136
What camp you from, soldier?

01:03:25.215 --> 01:03:28.082
U.S. Marines on one side
and Cavalry on the other.

01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:29.982
A horse marine! I always wanted to see one.

01:03:30.053 --> 01:03:32.078
Do you mind if I examine
the evidence, Corporal?

01:03:32.155 --> 01:03:35.056
- Sergeant, if it's all the same to you...
- Just leave him alone!

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.615
I can explain everything to my father!

01:03:36.693 --> 01:03:39.821
- But can you explain it to the judge?
- What judge! What's the charge?

01:03:39.896 --> 01:03:41.796
- I fear there may be several.
- What are they?

01:03:41.865 --> 01:03:44.527
If it's all the same to you,
I'm the sheriff of this county...

01:03:44.601 --> 01:03:45.932
and will conduct the investigation.

01:03:46.002 --> 01:03:49.961
You happen to be in Morgan's Creek
and I happen to be the town constable.

01:03:50.039 --> 01:03:52.166
So if anybody's going to conduct
an investigation...

01:03:52.242 --> 01:03:55.678
It's a federal matter, as a matter of fact,
so if it's all the same to you...

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:59.181
The way I learned, any man in uniform
is in the Army till proved different.

01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:00.682
So we'll just take him over to camp.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.718
Take your hands off my prisoner!

01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:04.412
Good evening, all.

01:04:04.487 --> 01:04:08.787
Who did what to who and where, any little
colorful sidelights and stories of interest?

01:04:08.858 --> 01:04:11.554
I'm Mr. Johnson, a lawyer.
I represent Norval Jones.

01:04:11.628 --> 01:04:14.119
Why, Norval! What are you doing
in your Boy Scout outfit?

01:04:14.197 --> 01:04:15.197
Boy Scout outfit?

01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:17.199
He's a mouthpiece.
He knows it's a U.S. Uniform.

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:19.599
- Don't fall for that stuff.
- What are you talking about?

01:04:19.669 --> 01:04:21.432
That's a Boy Scout outfit if ever I saw one.

01:04:21.504 --> 01:04:24.701
I remember very well when you joined
the Scouts. I said to Mrs. Johnson...

01:04:24.774 --> 01:04:26.969
- No.
- It isn't? Of course it isn't!

01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:29.477
I remember now.
The Woodsmen of the World.

01:04:29.546 --> 01:04:31.980
The Woodsmen of the World.
I remember when your axe came.

01:04:32.048 --> 01:04:34.573
I said to Mrs. Johnson,
"I hope he's not going to chop..."

01:04:34.651 --> 01:04:37.347
No? Very well, Norval.

01:04:37.487 --> 01:04:40.752
What's the alleged charge?
It being understood that we admit nothing.

01:04:40.823 --> 01:04:44.919
- Trudy! What happened?
- I don't know, Mr. Rafferty.

01:04:47.063 --> 01:04:48.587
Quiet!

01:04:50.733 --> 01:04:51.733
Oh, Papa!

01:04:51.801 --> 01:04:53.598
Never mind the "Oh, Papa".
What happened?

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.297
- Oh, Papa!
- What happened?

01:04:55.371 --> 01:04:56.929
- Everything.
- You go upstairs to bed.

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:59.770
- This ain't for 14-year-olds. Go on now.
- Piffle!

01:04:59.842 --> 01:05:01.707
Will you get off my lap and get out of here?

01:05:01.778 --> 01:05:03.211
She knows all about it, Papa.

01:05:03.279 --> 01:05:06.442
She does, does she? How about
letting your old man in on some of the dirt?

01:05:06.516 --> 01:05:08.040
Or am I being too snoopy?

01:05:08.117 --> 01:05:10.483
You think it's wise?
He'll blab it all over town.

01:05:10.553 --> 01:05:13.488
- Listen, ladder legs...
- It'll be all over town anyway, now.

01:05:13.556 --> 01:05:16.719
- Even the secret?
- The secret? This is some secret.

01:05:16.793 --> 01:05:18.522
Will you kindly keep your nose out of this?

01:05:18.595 --> 01:05:20.893
It's already been established
the matter's not military!

01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:23.057
I told you what you could expect
from that pickle...

01:05:23.132 --> 01:05:25.896
You mustn't talk that way about him.
He was only trying his best.

01:05:25.969 --> 01:05:28.733
- Imagine if he hadn't been really trying.
- Who signed what?

01:05:28.805 --> 01:05:30.773
Who's Katzenjammer
and where does he tend bar?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.206
- It was Norval. You wouldn't understand.
- Understand it?

01:05:33.276 --> 01:05:35.107
You got the certificate? You didn't muff that.

01:05:35.178 --> 01:05:36.702
- I haven't got it.
- What certificate?

01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:38.804
Her marriage certificate.
Why didn't you get it?

01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:41.145
- He pulled a gun and...
- Who pulled a gun, that Norval?

01:05:41.217 --> 01:05:42.241
Don't try to understand.

01:05:42.318 --> 01:05:44.183
Then all those policemen came,
and that's all.

01:05:44.254 --> 01:05:46.984
- Who's got the certificate?
- I don't know. The justice, I guess.

01:05:47.056 --> 01:05:49.024
- What certificate?
- Her marriage certificate.

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:52.027
- To Ratzkiwatzki.
- To Ratzkiwatzki? I told Jones to marry you.

01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:56.122
She's already married, perfectly respectably,
to a gentleman called Ratzkiwatzki.

01:05:56.199 --> 01:05:58.895
Only she can't prove it.
She hasn't got the certificate.

01:05:58.968 --> 01:06:02.028
- So tonight I married him again.
- Just to get the certificate. See?

01:06:02.105 --> 01:06:04.573
- No.
- You have to have a certificate.

01:06:04.641 --> 01:06:07.371
- So she married Norval.
- She married Norval?

01:06:07.443 --> 01:06:09.741
To prove I was married to Ratzkiwatzki.

01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:13.407
But then he signed the wrong name and
now they've got him and we're in the soup.

01:06:13.483 --> 01:06:15.974
- I'll shoot him!
- He didn't sign the wrong name on purpose.

01:06:16.052 --> 01:06:18.919
- I'll shoot him anyway.
- The one you wanna shoot is Ratzkiwatzki.

01:06:18.988 --> 01:06:21.980
- Isn't he Ratzkiwatzki?
- No, I married him a long time ago.

01:06:22.058 --> 01:06:24.856
- When?
- The night I was out with Norval.

01:06:24.927 --> 01:06:26.485
Can't you understand anything?

01:06:27.563 --> 01:06:29.394
They can't agree on anything, Edmund.

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:31.330
Each one wants to put him in his own jail.

01:06:31.401 --> 01:06:34.700
If they do, we won't be able
to find him again, let alone get him out.

01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:38.229
- Have you got anything against him?
- Nothing except a good kick in the pants.

01:06:38.308 --> 01:06:39.741
I'll tell you what you do.

01:06:39.809 --> 01:06:41.902
You take him down
and lock him up in your jail...

01:06:41.978 --> 01:06:43.741
and then they can draw lots
for him tomorrow.

01:06:43.813 --> 01:06:45.474
Meantime, we'll sit the whole thing down.

01:06:45.548 --> 01:06:48.517
It's perfectly ridiculous.
They've got 19 charges against that boy.

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:50.814
But he didn't do
any of those things, Mr. Johnson.

01:06:50.887 --> 01:06:53.754
He didn't do any of that?
He did all that in the eyes of the law.

01:06:53.823 --> 01:06:56.121
- Will you do that for me, Ed?
- All right.

01:06:56.225 --> 01:07:00.093
And what you two ought to have
is good shellacking. Daughters. Phooey.

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:05.828
You're under arrest! Follow me.

01:07:05.902 --> 01:07:07.563
- You can't do that!
- Quiet!

01:07:07.637 --> 01:07:10.197
One more crack out of you guys
and I'll lock you all up!

01:07:10.273 --> 01:07:12.332
- Come on, ox brains!
- Norval!

01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:14.308
- Don't worry, Trudy.
- I'll be...

01:07:14.377 --> 01:07:16.777
- I'll knit you something.
- You'll have lots of time.

01:07:16.846 --> 01:07:20.043
Who asked you something? Put away
that gun before you shoot somebody!

01:07:20.116 --> 01:07:23.085
Come on. You get back in the kitchen.
I ain't finished with you.

01:07:23.152 --> 01:07:24.619
Shame on you, Norval Jones!

01:07:24.687 --> 01:07:28.248
Shame on you! That'll teach you
to besmirch the name of our fair city.

01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:34.855
- I'll take one of those.
- Me, too.

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:38.526
Go on home, folks. There you are.

01:07:39.168 --> 01:07:41.227
Go on before I pinch some...

01:07:46.843 --> 01:07:48.037
Yeah?

01:07:48.644 --> 01:07:50.544
I wouldn't want this to go no further, see?

01:07:50.613 --> 01:07:52.706
But you and your daughter
are in enough trouble...

01:07:52.782 --> 01:07:56.013
without having to annul this marriage
and go through all that rigmarole.

01:07:56.085 --> 01:07:57.575
- You get me?
- No. Go on home now!

01:07:57.653 --> 01:08:00.622
I could've called the cops in
before the ceremony instead of after.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:03.784
If I don't write it on the books,
it ain't a marriage, is it?

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.953
That's certainly
mighty white of you, brother.

01:08:06.028 --> 01:08:08.155
That's all right. I may call on you someday.

01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:10.597
Here's your $2. There was no marriage.

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:12.429
She was saved in the nick of time.

01:08:12.502 --> 01:08:14.993
That's mighty white of you brother,
mighty white!

01:08:15.071 --> 01:08:17.733
And here's the last evidence, the certificate.

01:08:17.807 --> 01:08:20.537
Now you see it, now you don't.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.636
- Not a trace.
- Thank you, brother!

01:08:24.413 --> 01:08:27.109
Forget it. I might call on you someday.

01:08:28.084 --> 01:08:32.453
- I wonder who else you could marry.
- Emmy! How can you be so heartless?

01:08:32.522 --> 01:08:36.982
I'll love Norval to my dying day.
How could I even look at another man?

01:08:37.059 --> 01:08:39.823
I think he's the most wonderful man
that ever lived.

01:08:39.895 --> 01:08:43.024
Yes, but he's going to be in jail,
Trudy, for a long time.

01:08:43.099 --> 01:08:46.933
He can't do you any good in stripes, honey.
You can't be so choosy.

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:48.368
Emmy!

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.038
Well, you fixed him...

01:08:56.112 --> 01:08:58.636
and you certainly give us
a good name in the town.

01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:00.908
You spend all your life behaving yourself...

01:09:00.983 --> 01:09:03.952
then they find your daughter
in a lovely mess.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.282
Don't take it that way, Papa.

01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:08.118
"Don't take it that way, Papa".
Don't take it what way, Papa?

01:09:08.191 --> 01:09:10.182
You're just a kid.
You can duck down the alleys.

01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:12.819
Me, I gotta stand in the middle
of the street and take it...

01:09:12.895 --> 01:09:14.522
from every rat in town.

01:09:14.596 --> 01:09:18.033
I'm sorry, Papa.
You told me not to go out that night.

01:09:18.401 --> 01:09:21.666
Yeah. I could be wrong, too, you know.

01:09:22.004 --> 01:09:24.529
Why don't you come to me
if you're worried about something?

01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:27.770
The trouble with kids is they
figure they're smarter than their parents.

01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:30.836
Never stop to think if their old man
could get by for 50 years...

01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:34.178
and feed them and clothe them,
he had something up here to get by with.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:37.617
Things that seem like brain twisters to you
might be very simple for him.

01:09:37.687 --> 01:09:38.984
Like this, for instance.

01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:41.386
There's your $2.
You never got married tonight.

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:43.550
- You got nothing to worry about.
- What?

01:09:43.626 --> 01:09:47.084
I got the guy to tear up the certificate.
Just a little politics.

01:09:47.162 --> 01:09:49.063
If you'd have come to me in the first place...

01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:51.189
You got the guy to tear up the certificate?

01:09:51.267 --> 01:09:53.633
- No!
- What's the matter with you?

01:09:53.703 --> 01:09:56.069
If nobody knows you're married
to this Katzenjammer...

01:09:56.138 --> 01:09:57.765
and it was all by mistake, anyway...

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.206
with false names a corpse couldn't dig up...

01:10:00.276 --> 01:10:02.904
why do you have to go
around proving things?

01:10:02.979 --> 01:10:04.879
Why can't you be practical?

01:10:05.047 --> 01:10:07.311
Shall we tell him or let him linger?

01:10:07.383 --> 01:10:10.181
- Tell him what?
- I'm going to have a baby.

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:12.014
You're going to have a baby.

01:10:13.356 --> 01:10:15.415
What do you mean,
you're going to have a baby?

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:17.152
I told you he'd blab it all over town!

01:10:17.226 --> 01:10:20.855
- That's why we wanted the certificate.
- The one you got the guy to tear up.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:23.194
The one I got the guy to tear up.

01:10:33.776 --> 01:10:37.234
Did Norval know about this
when he asked you to marry him?

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.642
Yes, Papa.

01:10:38.714 --> 01:10:41.274
So he gets charged with abduction,
imitating a soldier...

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:44.786
repairing the morals of a minor,
resisting arrest, perjury!

01:10:45.121 --> 01:10:46.782
He'll be lucky if he gets life.

01:10:46.856 --> 01:10:50.087
When your little surprise package happens,
he'll probably get some more.

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:51.456
You've got to let him escape.

01:10:51.527 --> 01:10:54.360
Sure, and take my pension
right along with him...

01:10:54.697 --> 01:10:58.463
that I've been working 17 years for,
and land in the hoosegow besides!

01:10:58.534 --> 01:11:01.594
Couldn't you think of some bright way?
You always have bright ideas.

01:11:01.671 --> 01:11:03.138
Listen, zipperpuss.

01:11:03.205 --> 01:11:06.368
Someday, they're just gonna find
your hair ribbon and an axe someplace.

01:11:06.442 --> 01:11:09.275
Nothing else.
The mystery of Morgan's Creek.

01:11:09.345 --> 01:11:11.643
Papa, that's really not being very helpful.

01:11:11.747 --> 01:11:14.648
Well, what do you want me to do,
learn to knit?

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:17.117
I'm going out for a walk.

01:11:41.978 --> 01:11:46.210
Trudy told me what you done for her,
at least, what you tried to do.

01:11:49.685 --> 01:11:52.483
- I didn't understand.
- That's all right.

01:11:52.622 --> 01:11:54.522
I'd just as soon she hadn't told you, though.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:57.286
The less people know about it,
the better it will be for her.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.124
- It's too bad it had to turn out like this.
- I'll be all right.

01:12:00.196 --> 01:12:03.859
What do you mean, you'll be all right? You
know what they got lined up against you?

01:12:03.933 --> 01:12:06.197
What'd you have to take a minor
to a motel for anyway?

01:12:06.268 --> 01:12:07.826
That's no place to take a minor.

01:12:07.903 --> 01:12:10.736
I'm not even thinking about that.
I'm so worried about Trudy.

01:12:10.806 --> 01:12:13.639
- Well, all she's worried about is you.
- Poor Trudy!

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:17.839
To think that I've got to be locked up
in here at the very time she needs me most.

01:12:18.214 --> 01:12:22.048
If I could just get out of here for a while,
I bet you I could find that skunk.

01:12:22.118 --> 01:12:23.745
I bet you I could.

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:26.580
I couldn't do it, Norval.
It would cost me my job.

01:12:26.656 --> 01:12:31.150
- Why, if I conspired in any way to...
- I didn't mean that, Mr. Kockenlocker.

01:12:31.827 --> 01:12:34.352
I wouldn't do anything
to get you in trouble...

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.728
just when Trudy needs you so much.

01:12:37.133 --> 01:12:38.225
If you got out...

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.498
it would have to be without any help
from me in any shape or form whatsoever.

01:12:42.872 --> 01:12:45.067
You'd have to do it all by yourself.

01:12:45.141 --> 01:12:47.871
I wasn't even thinking
about anything like that.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:51.673
Of course, if turn my back on you...

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:53.271
carelessly like...

01:12:54.684 --> 01:12:57.380
and you happened to grab my blackjack...

01:12:58.087 --> 01:13:00.112
and conk me over the dome with it...

01:13:03.025 --> 01:13:04.754
that would be something else.

01:13:04.827 --> 01:13:07.660
As if I'd do anything like that,
Mr. Kockenlocker.

01:13:08.998 --> 01:13:12.161
Or if you made a sudden dive for me,
grabbed me around the neck...

01:13:12.234 --> 01:13:14.634
spin me, hit me on the jaw.

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:18.129
And while I lie here helplessly, you beat it.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.467
As if I'd do anything like that, either.

01:13:21.143 --> 01:13:24.601
- How did you do in school?
- Who, me? Fine.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.145
Is that so?

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.277
Kind of stuffy in here, ain't it?

01:13:30.352 --> 01:13:32.877
- I hadn't noticed it.
- Yes, you had!

01:13:33.155 --> 01:13:35.555
I'll go around the back
and open the window.

01:13:35.658 --> 01:13:38.684
- It works from the outside. You get me?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:38.794 --> 01:13:42.161
- Way around in the back.
- Thanks very much.

01:13:50.406 --> 01:13:51.668
You get me?

01:13:56.212 --> 01:13:59.272
Be careful, Mr. Kockenlocker!

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:12.692
It's a good thing you didn't
try to run away just now.

01:14:12.762 --> 01:14:14.923
I forgot to lock the doors...

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:17.989
and it would take me five minutes
to get down out of this tree.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.326
You get me?

01:14:19.401 --> 01:14:22.063
Don't you worry, Mr. Kockenlocker.
I'll be right here.

01:14:31.113 --> 01:14:33.479
Are you hurt, Mr. Kockenlocker?

01:14:33.549 --> 01:14:36.848
I'm all right.
It just knocked the wind out of me.

01:14:37.052 --> 01:14:40.215
Only, I ain't going to do any running
for the next hour or so...

01:14:40.289 --> 01:14:42.587
not if you give me a million dollars.
You get me?

01:14:42.658 --> 01:14:45.684
- Yes, sir.
- And my gun is way over there someplace.

01:14:46.095 --> 01:14:47.323
I'm defenseless.

01:14:47.396 --> 01:14:49.330
I'll go get it for you.

01:14:56.438 --> 01:14:58.599
All right, you got me, pal! Don't shoot!

01:14:58.674 --> 01:15:00.869
I know when I'm licked.
Just lock me in the jail.

01:15:00.943 --> 01:15:02.740
- The key is in the door.
- No...

01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:06.009
Shut up! I know you're going to escape,
but I can't help it.

01:15:06.081 --> 01:15:07.514
I can't do anything about it.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:09.551
My car is right down in front of my house...

01:15:09.618 --> 01:15:12.781
and if you need any gas there's a can
with five gallons in my woodshed.

01:15:12.855 --> 01:15:15.187
But you wouldn't take that from me,
would you, pal?

01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:17.953
Of course I wouldn't, Mr. Kockenlocker.

01:15:18.661 --> 01:15:20.526
Maybe I can make things clearer, Norval.

01:15:26.001 --> 01:15:28.401
Jiggers! There's somebody in there!

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.252
You get back to bed!

01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:56.025
- Papa, he isn't guilty of anything.
- Why isn't he in his cell?

01:15:56.098 --> 01:15:58.396
How about keeping your trap shut?
He escaped.

01:15:58.467 --> 01:16:00.935
Can't you see he's got me covered?
Don't shoot, Norval.

01:16:01.003 --> 01:16:02.003
No.

01:16:02.204 --> 01:16:05.196
Papa! You don't think
they'll fire you, do you?

01:16:05.274 --> 01:16:07.640
Of course they won't.
I just picked this gun up for him.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:10.338
- I'm not going anyplace.
- All right, I give up.

01:16:10.412 --> 01:16:12.903
See if you can do anything with him.

01:16:13.716 --> 01:16:17.709
I want you to go away, Norval.
Don't you understand that, dear?

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.755
I couldn't bear to have you in trouble,
on top of everything else.

01:16:20.823 --> 01:16:23.053
But that would only make
matters worse, Trudy.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:25.116
They can't send me up for very long.

01:16:25.194 --> 01:16:28.925
And, anyway, I'll be happy about it,
because I'll be doing it for you, Trudy.

01:16:29.031 --> 01:16:31.556
Every day I'll think, well, this is for Trudy.

01:16:31.634 --> 01:16:35.695
And as soon as I get out we'll straighten it
out somehow and we'll be married again.

01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:38.433
But really, Trudy, for always and always.

01:16:38.507 --> 01:16:41.408
You're just making me cry,
but you're not helping anything.

01:16:41.477 --> 01:16:42.739
- Don't cry, Trudy!
- Norval!

01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:44.642
What about that guy you were gonna find...

01:16:44.713 --> 01:16:46.203
if you could just get out for a while?

01:16:46.282 --> 01:16:48.614
That's right!
Maybe you can find Ratzkiwatzki.

01:16:48.684 --> 01:16:51.346
Of course you can.
Anyway, it's worth trying.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.420
Do you really think so?

01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:55.218
If I really thought so,
I'd track him to the ends of the earth.

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:57.191
- Of course you can.
- But I haven't any car.

01:16:57.259 --> 01:16:58.317
- Steal mine.
- It's insured.

01:16:58.394 --> 01:17:01.295
- Shut up!
- Lf I was really sure it was for you, Trudy...

01:17:01.363 --> 01:17:03.831
and not for selfish reasons,
I'd need a little money.

01:17:03.899 --> 01:17:06.697
I've got $900 in the bank,
only, it's in bonds.

01:17:06.769 --> 01:17:09.363
Would it be wrong if I took $900 in cash...

01:17:09.438 --> 01:17:11.497
and left my bonds?
I've got a key at the house.

01:17:11.573 --> 01:17:13.598
It might be wrong,
but it would be very handy.

01:17:16.412 --> 01:17:19.006
All we needed was a little bank robbery.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.617
- Will you get out of here?
- I'll be all right, Papa.

01:17:34.964 --> 01:17:37.296
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

01:17:37.399 --> 01:17:39.560
Why don't you look where you're going?

01:17:44.606 --> 01:17:47.166
I'll leave a note the minute I get through.

01:17:47.643 --> 01:17:49.941
You have to be very careful with this.

01:17:50.145 --> 01:17:53.376
You have to know exactly
what to do or else...

01:17:54.116 --> 01:17:55.583
it'll set off the alarm.

01:17:55.651 --> 01:17:57.414
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:07.418
Beat it!

01:18:13.702 --> 01:18:15.795
Come on, Emmy.

01:18:15.871 --> 01:18:17.668
- Goodbye, Norval.
- Goodbye, Trudy.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.836
- Beat it, Norval.
- Norval, you've got to hurry! Goodbye.

01:18:22.444 --> 01:18:24.207
Go on, Norval!

01:18:26.615 --> 01:18:30.551
Tie me up, quick! Come on!
Around here. Tie it tight. Come on!

01:18:30.619 --> 01:18:34.419
Yes, Papa. Here, Emmy. Swing him.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:44.395
All right, not so hard!
What are you trying to do, strangle me?

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:47.435
All right, that's tight enough.
Now, a little clunk on the head.

01:18:47.503 --> 01:18:51.098
Take the blackjack out of my pocket,
lock the door, beat it home, hide the keys.

01:18:51.173 --> 01:18:53.505
- All right, Papa. Which side?
- Any side! Harder!

01:18:53.575 --> 01:18:57.306
But not too hard! Harder.
How could that knock anybody out?

01:18:57.546 --> 01:19:01.312
Is that all the harder you can hit?
Will you try to do one thing right?

01:19:01.383 --> 01:19:04.352
- Here!
- Papa!

01:19:05.587 --> 01:19:06.713
Emmy!

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:09.755
Papa, did we hurt you?

01:19:10.125 --> 01:19:14.494
Wait a minute! Never mind the details.
Is the girl married or isn't she married?

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:17.463
It's a matter of state honor.
A matter of public weal!

01:19:17.533 --> 01:19:21.629
I'm very sorry, Mr. Governor, but nobody
knows whether she's married or not.

01:19:21.703 --> 01:19:24.103
She's got to be married,
that's all there is to it!

01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:27.141
We can't have a thing like that
hanging over our fair state...

01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:28.733
besmirching our fair name.

01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:31.177
<i>- Where is the father now?
- In jail.</i>

01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:32.440
What do you mean he's in jail?

01:19:32.514 --> 01:19:35.244
Do you realize he's one of the most
famous men in the world?

01:19:35.317 --> 01:19:38.150
- I thought you said he escaped.
- He did say he escaped.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.018
Yes, but he came back
and got caught again.

01:19:41.356 --> 01:19:42.448
- When?
- Yes.

01:19:42.524 --> 01:19:43.548
<i>Yesterday.</i>

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:46.617
<i>It must have been around 6:00,
I guess, because Mr. Tuerck...</i>

01:19:46.695 --> 01:19:50.461
<i>was still in the bank with the Christmas Club
and Mr. Rafferty was in his store.</i>

01:19:50.532 --> 01:19:52.466
<i>It was closer to 7:00.</i>

01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:09.942
- They left about six months ago.
- Six months ago?

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:13.852
They left kind of hurriedly, right after
he was discharged by the town council.

01:20:13.922 --> 01:20:15.082
Discharged? What for?

01:20:15.157 --> 01:20:18.456
It had to do with the escape of a prisoner.
They didn't quite believe it.

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:20.051
- You mean me?
- I guess so, Norval.

01:20:20.129 --> 01:20:23.292
But that's terrible!
I was just trying to help Trudy.

01:20:23.599 --> 01:20:26.295
Looking for someone I never found.

01:20:27.369 --> 01:20:29.394
But you wouldn't know
about that, or would you?

01:20:29.471 --> 01:20:31.496
I don't know what you're talking about,
Norval.

01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:34.565
Anyway, now that I'm back and
ready to give myself up, I guess...

01:20:34.643 --> 01:20:37.612
they'll take Mr. Kockenlocker back
on the job all right, won't they?

01:20:37.679 --> 01:20:41.137
I hardly think so, Norval. Besides, you know
what Mr. Kockenlocker is like.

01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:45.209
He didn't exactly take it lying down when
they fired him. He left on very bad terms.

01:20:45.287 --> 01:20:47.881
They had to take six stitches
in Mr. Tuerck alone.

01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:49.753
- Poor Trudy.
- Poor Mr. Tuerck.

01:20:49.825 --> 01:20:50.951
It was ghastly.

01:20:51.026 --> 01:20:54.325
You haven't asked my advice, Norval,
and it certainly isn't up to me...

01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:58.059
to advise you to evade the law, but since
you were dragged into this situation...

01:20:58.133 --> 01:21:01.762
and it's practically forgotten now anyway,
and the Kockenlockers have gone...

01:21:01.837 --> 01:21:05.466
probably taken root someplace else.
They may have even changed their names.

01:21:05.541 --> 01:21:08.704
- Why don't you do the same?
- I'm sure it would be wiser, Norval.

01:21:08.844 --> 01:21:12.575
But I couldn't do that, Mrs. Johnson.
I've just got to find Trudy.

01:21:12.714 --> 01:21:14.705
She must be in terrible trouble now.

01:21:14.783 --> 01:21:16.842
I've given you my very best advice, Norval.

01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:19.046
It's up to you to act
as your conscience dictates...

01:21:19.121 --> 01:21:21.453
but if there were
that many charges pending over me...

01:21:21.523 --> 01:21:23.388
you wouldn't see my coattail for the dust.

01:21:23.458 --> 01:21:26.950
Even if they didn't press the Kockenlocker
charges, there's the uniform...

01:21:27.029 --> 01:21:31.728
- the jail break, the bank robbery.
- Bank robbery? But I took my own money.

01:21:32.034 --> 01:21:33.831
Norval, I'm so glad.

01:21:33.902 --> 01:21:37.531
So am I, but that isn't exactly what
Mr. Tuerck allowed us to understand.

01:21:37.906 --> 01:21:39.396
Holy mackerel!

01:21:40.609 --> 01:21:41.940
Goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:43.602
- Goodbye, Mr. Johnson.
- Goodbye, Norval.

01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:45.044
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:47.775
Norval, wouldn't you like to take
some fruitcake with you?

01:21:47.849 --> 01:21:51.842
No, thank you, Mrs. Johnson.
I'm afraid I couldn't swallow it.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.317
- Merry Christmas, dear.
- Merry Christmas to you.

01:22:06.101 --> 01:22:10.231
- Merry Christmas, Mr. And Mrs. Shottish.
- And a merry Christmas to you, Mr. Rafferty.

01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:13.297
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Rafferty.
- Many happy returns.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.641
- Hello, Mr. Rafferty.
- What are you doing here?

01:22:20.716 --> 01:22:24.015
- Don't tell me! You're just in time.
- Do you know where Trudy is?

01:22:24.086 --> 01:22:28.614
I know from nothing. Wait a minute.
I'm just going to see her.

01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:31.789
You'll take them around a turkey.

01:22:59.788 --> 01:23:02.621
You'll buy at the bakery a plum pudding.

01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:06.784
Nothing gives so much indigestion,
at the same time so much pleasure...

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:08.921
like a plum pudding, except a fruitcake.

01:23:09.031 --> 01:23:11.659
One time when I was a boy...

01:23:13.268 --> 01:23:15.498
Good evening, Mr. Rafferty,
and you, Mr. Jones.

01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:17.731
I wondered if you'd come back.

01:23:35.257 --> 01:23:37.748
Anyway, we're going to have
a white Christmas.

01:23:39.795 --> 01:23:42.320
Why don't you say something?

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.535
How about a little smile?

01:23:54.643 --> 01:23:57.043
You've got to have more confidence
in the Almighty...

01:23:57.112 --> 01:23:59.842
or whatever it is
that makes the wheels go round.

01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:02.315
All right? It's almost Christmas.

01:24:02.451 --> 01:24:05.011
Where was he born? In a cowshed.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:08.715
You might be waiting
for the President of the United States.

01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:10.951
You got to have more confidence.

01:24:11.026 --> 01:24:14.291
Speaking of cowsheds, did you remember
to milk Bessie tonight, Papa?

01:24:14.363 --> 01:24:17.298
Yes, I remembered
to milk Bessie tonight, Papa.

01:24:17.366 --> 01:24:21.735
- Then what's she doing in the kitchen?
- What? Will you get out of here?

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:25.335
Come on, get out of here! Come on.

01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:27.605
Poor Papa.

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:38.180
Hello, Mr. Rafferty.

01:24:38.253 --> 01:24:40.813
- It's so good to see you.
- I've brought you a turkey.

01:24:40.889 --> 01:24:44.586
- Hello, Mr. Rafferty.
- Trudy. Feeling good?

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.423
It's natural.

01:24:47.496 --> 01:24:50.431
Thank you, Mr. Rafferty,
and for all your kindness.

01:24:50.499 --> 01:24:52.831
I don't know where we would have been
without you.

01:24:52.901 --> 01:24:54.926
What are you talking? It's a privilege.

01:24:55.003 --> 01:24:59.372
The doctor will come from the next town,
then he'll go back to his town and forget it.

01:24:59.441 --> 01:25:04.037
You got nothing to worry about.
It'll be as quiet as a buttered eagle.

01:25:04.146 --> 01:25:05.977
Would you have a cup of tea, Mr. Rafferty?

01:25:06.047 --> 01:25:07.480
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:07.549 --> 01:25:08.549
How's Papa?

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:10.380
Fine, thank you. He's out with Bessie.

01:25:10.452 --> 01:25:13.444
That Bessie, I remember her.
Never satisfied.

01:25:13.922 --> 01:25:16.254
I brought Papa back his car.

01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:18.217
But Norval had it.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.126
You mean he came back? Where is he?
Why didn't he come out with you?

01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:25.329
He didn't find anybody
while he was away, Trudy.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.527
That's no reason for him
not to come out to see me.

01:25:27.602 --> 01:25:30.696
He ought to know better than that,
when I've been waiting so long...

01:25:30.772 --> 01:25:33.639
- so anxiously to see him.
- That ain't why he didn't come back.

01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:37.371
- They caught him again. He's in jail.
- Mr. Rafferty!

01:25:38.313 --> 01:25:42.215
Now, what good is this?
You've got something else to think about.

01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:45.111
So he's in jail, so he'll get out someday.

01:25:45.187 --> 01:25:48.588
All right. I'll go back to Morgan's Creek
and I'll tell them everything.

01:25:48.657 --> 01:25:52.115
They'll have to drop the charges
when I tell them what he did and why.

01:25:52.194 --> 01:25:54.719
What are you talking?
How about your reputation?

01:25:54.796 --> 01:25:58.459
We spend six months planning,
fixing everything, building up a secret.

01:25:58.533 --> 01:26:01.229
- Now you got to build it down, overnight?
- I've got to.

01:26:01.303 --> 01:26:04.636
All right, you don't care about yourself.
How about your father?

01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:06.230
Ain't he got enough trouble?

01:26:06.308 --> 01:26:08.776
How about your sister?
How about me? How about...

01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:10.368
Anyway, they wouldn't believe you.

01:26:10.445 --> 01:26:11.707
They will when they see me.

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.476
Trudy, will you listen to...

01:26:14.683 --> 01:26:17.151
What's the use? I love you for it.

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.444
There.

01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:23.521
You still have time to change your mind.

01:26:23.592 --> 01:26:26.993
Why don't you, Trudy?
I'll get him out on bail, and...

01:26:35.003 --> 01:26:38.166
Either we make an example of this man,
or we're opening the doors...

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.071
- and inviting crime in to dinner.
- Piffle.

01:26:40.141 --> 01:26:41.540
It may be piffle in your book...

01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:45.569
but I say that breaking and entering,
theft, perjury, impersonating a soldier...

01:26:45.647 --> 01:26:49.174
impairing the morals of a minor,
jailbreak, with or without conspiracy...

01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:52.118
et cetera, et cetera, are not piffle!

01:26:52.187 --> 01:26:54.155
- Piffle.
- You say that once more, Johnson...

01:26:54.222 --> 01:26:55.587
- and I'll...
- Piffle.

01:26:55.657 --> 01:26:58.148
Gentlemen, please!

01:26:58.393 --> 01:27:01.089
There's a great deal to be said
for both sides.

01:27:01.162 --> 01:27:02.288
Hey.

01:27:10.939 --> 01:27:12.406
My daughter wants to see you.

01:27:12.474 --> 01:27:14.772
- Right away.
- What are you doing in Morgan's Creek?

01:27:14.843 --> 01:27:17.676
I warned you that if you ever showed
up in this town again...

01:27:17.746 --> 01:27:19.873
- Yeah?
- Gentlemen, is this the Christmas spirit?

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:22.348
What is it that you want, Mr. Kockenlocker?

01:27:22.417 --> 01:27:26.251
My daughter wants to tell you about
Norval, why he done what he done.

01:27:26.321 --> 01:27:28.482
She says when you hear
what she has to say...

01:27:28.557 --> 01:27:29.819
you'll never prosecute him.

01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:31.415
- Impossible.
- You see?

01:27:31.493 --> 01:27:34.223
Well, bring her up.
We must hear both sides, always.

01:27:34.296 --> 01:27:35.888
That is strictly the bunk.

01:27:35.964 --> 01:27:38.194
Women are always trying
to take the blame for men.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.029
It's what you call a mother instinct.

01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:42.035
You can listen to her, can't you, you dumb...

01:27:42.103 --> 01:27:45.971
Or I'll take my business out of your bank
so quick it will make your hair sizzle.

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:47.041
Gentlemen. Bring her up.

01:27:47.108 --> 01:27:49.201
I'm afraid you'll have to come down.

01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:50.969
She don't feel very good.

01:27:51.046 --> 01:27:52.046
Really?

01:27:52.447 --> 01:27:55.416
Is that so? Well.

01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:57.811
Yes. What about it, you dumb...

01:27:57.986 --> 01:27:58.986
Gentlemen!

01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:00.384
Papa!

01:28:07.829 --> 01:28:09.387
- Trudy! Trudy is...
- Trudy?

01:28:09.497 --> 01:28:13.160
Well, what are you standing there?
Doctor! Come quick!

01:29:12.861 --> 01:29:13.861
Some secret.

01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:16.158
So they know. So what do they know?

01:29:22.837 --> 01:29:25.863
Have you any statement to make?
Any little item of general interest?

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.704
- How would you like a punch in the nose?
- Mr. Kockenlocker!

01:29:28.777 --> 01:29:30.108
Now, let me handle this.

01:29:30.178 --> 01:29:33.545
- How much would it take to keep this quiet?
- Mr. Rafferty.

01:29:34.482 --> 01:29:35.915
- It's a boy.
- A boy!

01:29:35.984 --> 01:29:39.078
<i>Trudy! That's wonderful! Mazel tov!</i>

01:29:39.154 --> 01:29:41.054
- Congratulations, Edmund.
- For what?

01:29:41.122 --> 01:29:44.250
A boy is a boy.
No matter how you look at it, it's...

01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:53.364
- Twins!
- Twins! That's wonderful!

01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:55.466
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you laughing?

01:29:55.537 --> 01:29:58.506
- Congratulations again, Edmund.
- Please be quiet.

01:29:58.573 --> 01:30:00.564
Kindly remember this is a hospital.

01:30:01.509 --> 01:30:04.910
- I'd like to get a few more facts.
- Will you get out of here?

01:30:06.614 --> 01:30:09.606
Now, where have you been living
for the last six months?

01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:18.157
Thank you very much. I have all I need.
I'll be getting back to the office.

01:30:40.915 --> 01:30:44.510
If you don't mind,
I guess I'll stick around a minute or two.

01:31:02.403 --> 01:31:04.735
Did she do that? My eyes ain't so good.

01:31:04.806 --> 01:31:06.398
- Did she do what?
- That!

01:31:06.474 --> 01:31:07.998
You don't suppose that...

01:31:08.076 --> 01:31:10.874
- Whoopee!
- Everybody, just keep calm.

01:31:10.945 --> 01:31:12.139
What?

01:31:13.148 --> 01:31:15.309
- Papa!
- Will you get off my neck?

01:31:16.384 --> 01:31:18.181
Everybody keep calm!

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.314
How is she, Doctor?

01:31:20.388 --> 01:31:21.787
Wonderful!

01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:25.716
Six! All boys!

01:31:44.112 --> 01:31:47.479
You mean he's still in jail,
you dumb blockhead?

01:31:47.549 --> 01:31:48.948
- Yes.
- Well, get him out.

01:31:49.017 --> 01:31:52.646
But how can I, Mr. Governor,
with all those charges against him?

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.587
By dropping those charges, you dumb cluck.

01:31:55.657 --> 01:31:56.919
You wealhead!

01:31:56.991 --> 01:31:58.959
Now, get me that banker on the phone.

01:31:59.027 --> 01:32:01.518
- His charter is cancelled!
- And the justice of the peace!

01:32:01.596 --> 01:32:03.826
His license is revoked
and his motel is condemned.

01:32:03.898 --> 01:32:05.991
Do you want the MPs and U.S. Men, too?

01:32:06.067 --> 01:32:07.295
What have they got to do with it?

01:32:07.368 --> 01:32:10.269
- That was a state guard uniform.
- I can see it from here.

01:32:10.338 --> 01:32:11.999
As a matter of fact, he's a colonel in it.

01:32:12.073 --> 01:32:15.304
- I'm bringing him his commission tomorrow.
- Retroactive as of last year.

01:32:15.376 --> 01:32:16.638
Go out and get him a uniform.

01:32:47.842 --> 01:32:50.367
There's only one thing more,
Mr. Governor, the marriage.

01:32:50.445 --> 01:32:52.208
- What's the matter with her marriage?
- Yeah!

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.646
She's married to Norval Jones.
She always has been.

01:32:54.716 --> 01:32:55.978
The guy married them, didn't he?

01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:57.813
The boy signed his right name, didn't he?

01:32:57.886 --> 01:33:00.514
But he gave his name as Ratzkiwatzki.

01:33:00.588 --> 01:33:02.579
He was trying to say Jones. He stuttered.

01:33:02.657 --> 01:33:04.921
What are you looking for,
needles in a haystack?

01:33:04.993 --> 01:33:08.019
- Then how about the first Ratzkiwatzki?
- He's annulled.

01:33:08.096 --> 01:33:10.963
- Who annulled him?
- The judge, who do you suppose?

01:33:11.032 --> 01:33:13.057
- Retroactive.
- Get Judge Mendoza on the phone.

01:33:13.134 --> 01:33:14.829
- I'm getting it.
- He's out of the picture.

01:33:14.903 --> 01:33:17.337
- He was never in it.
- Get me those guys on the phone.

01:33:17.405 --> 01:33:19.737
Who do they think they are, anyway?
Hello, Mendoza.

01:33:19.807 --> 01:33:21.570
Fooling with the honor of our fair state!

01:33:45.934 --> 01:33:48.266
- Hello, Mr. Kockenlocker.
- How's Trudy?

01:33:48.336 --> 01:33:51.396
She's sleeping, but she'll see you
in a few minutes. Come on!

01:33:51.472 --> 01:33:53.133
I wouldn't want to get you in wrong again.

01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:56.074
Get me in wrong, I'm the chief!
Where have you been?

01:33:56.144 --> 01:33:58.442
- Right here.
- Haven't you heard about...

01:33:58.513 --> 01:33:59.639
About what?

01:33:59.714 --> 01:34:02.706
- You mean she's had it?
- Has she had it?

01:34:03.084 --> 01:34:04.642
You'd better come and see your wife.

01:34:04.719 --> 01:34:08.587
- My wife? I'm not...
- Yes, you are, my boy!

01:34:40.722 --> 01:34:41.882
Quiet!

01:35:47.688 --> 01:35:48.916
Norval.

01:35:50.124 --> 01:35:51.124
Trudy.

01:35:52.293 --> 01:35:54.386
You look so beautiful.

01:35:54.529 --> 01:35:57.521
- Where did you get...
- I don't know. The Governor sent it.

01:35:57.598 --> 01:36:00.999
- You look so beautiful.
- I love you.

01:36:01.069 --> 01:36:05.096
Your father said...
I don't understand exactly how...

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.940
I don't understand a lot of things.
But I'm out of jail now...

01:36:11.546 --> 01:36:15.482
and we're really married, Trudy.
For always and always.

01:36:15.616 --> 01:36:17.277
I'm so happy.

01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:19.049
I love you.

01:36:20.421 --> 01:36:22.082
You're a papa now.

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:24.654
I feel like one, anyway.

01:36:25.093 --> 01:36:26.458
You are one.

01:36:27.028 --> 01:36:29.622
The papa gives love and protection.

01:36:29.997 --> 01:36:33.330
I'll do the best I can, Trudy,
for always and always.

01:36:33.768 --> 01:36:36.134
We'll have to pick out a name for it.

01:36:36.337 --> 01:36:38.328
Was it a boy or a girl?

01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:42.065
I'll find out.

01:36:42.777 --> 01:36:44.267
I'm so happy.

01:36:59.827 --> 01:37:01.795
Was it a boy or a girl?

01:38:07.962 --> 01:38:09.224
The spots!

01:38:10.798 --> 01:38:12.288
Emmy! Do something!
