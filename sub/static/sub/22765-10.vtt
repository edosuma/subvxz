00:07.990 --> 00:09.990
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:09.990 --> 00:12.500
The school. They're using
its construction as a cover.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.550
Basically our whole lives
they've been planning
on how to end the world.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.840
Getting rid of anyone
who stood in their way.

00:19.430 --> 00:22.020
We have to stop this.
No one else will.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.610
<i>So, at least</i>
<i>two other people knew</i>
<i>that Amy was in danger...</i>

00:24.610 --> 00:26.860
‐whoever warned her...
‐And whoever killed her.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.530
On the night
of the failed sacrifice,

00:28.530 --> 00:30.450
your children
witnessed everything.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.080
They've been conspiring
against you for weeks.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.670
How do you know all this?

00:33.670 --> 00:35.670
Because one of you did
the right thing and came to me.

00:35.670 --> 00:39.510
Let me ask you again.
Where are your children?

00:39.510 --> 00:41.680
<i>Once we get in there,</i>
<i>we destroy as much as we can</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:43.350
<i>as fast as we can,
then we get out.</i>

00:43.350 --> 00:46.150
Are you mad at me
about what happened
between us?

00:46.150 --> 00:48.530
<i>I've just</i>
<i>wanted to do that</i>
<i>for a really long time.</i>

00:48.530 --> 00:50.910
Almost 20 years I've been
waiting to see what the hell

00:50.910 --> 00:52.330
old G's gonna do with this shit.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.080
<i>I guess it's finally on.</i>

00:58.470 --> 00:59.800
Time to come home, son.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.720
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.560
- ‐ We're a family.
- ‐ We are a family.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.520
And we'll fight you
if we have to!

01:18.880 --> 01:21.180
Looks like all your kids
have a little something extra.

01:21.180 --> 01:24.480
Not Gert, all right?
She's just a regular kid.

01:29.070 --> 01:32.120
Disobeyed me. Good call.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.040
That could've only come
from one place.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.750
I've been meaning
to bring you all
up to speed on that.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.300
I got this.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.210
No!

01:48.530 --> 01:51.610
Fine, if that's how
they wanna play,
then let's bring it!

02:05.430 --> 02:06.310
Karolina.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.270
I can help her!

02:19.960 --> 02:22.050
What‐‐ What?

02:27.560 --> 02:29.610
- ‐Chase, run!
- ‐ Jonah, stop!

02:31.030 --> 02:32.700
Let's try to reason with them.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
Tina!

02:42.050 --> 02:44.050
I swear, Jonah,
if you hurt my son...!

02:44.050 --> 02:45.600
Geoffrey, please.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.100
Jonah, this isn't necessary.

02:51.650 --> 02:52.900
Please.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.550
No.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.860
Oh, my God.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.850
You guys have to go.
He came for me.

04:12.810 --> 04:13.940
‐What? ‐Are you crazy?

04:13.940 --> 04:15.650
No, we're not leaving you.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.700
I'll hold him off
and I'll meet you
outside, okay?

04:17.700 --> 04:19.910
‐lt's the only way.
‐Don't do this, please,
I'm begging you!

04:19.910 --> 04:22.170
‐ Chase, run!
‐You can't do this alone!

04:22.170 --> 04:24.460
‐ Alex, go! ‐Go. Go!

04:24.460 --> 04:26.260
‐I'm not leaving you.
‐Told you to go. Go.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.600
Nico, go. You have to go.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.810
‐Go with them!
‐Get to somewhere safe!

04:30.810 --> 04:32.190
What are you doing?

04:32.190 --> 04:33.650
‐We'll find you! ‐Karolina!

05:00.450 --> 05:01.490
Aah!

05:07.300 --> 05:08.420
Ugh...

05:35.060 --> 05:36.900
‐Look out.
‐Who the hell is that guy?

05:38.070 --> 05:40.320
‐ ‐

07:14.300 --> 07:15.970
Maybe Karolina won.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.850
Then where is she?

07:27.870 --> 07:29.370
Car's dead.

07:31.670 --> 07:32.590
So are these.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.380
An EMP, it fried everything.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.720
Oh, my God, stop talking about
how everything is fried

07:37.720 --> 07:39.180
and dead right now, please!

07:39.180 --> 07:41.150
Hey, maybe Karolina's okay.
Maybe she escaped.

07:41.150 --> 07:42.770
To where?!

07:42.770 --> 07:44.530
Maybe she's hiding.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.740
I just, I can't take
this anymore.
I'm going back.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.040
Come on, Nico.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.670
You've gotta be smart.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.210
I mean, look at us.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.100
Yeah. We're missing someone!

08:12.420 --> 08:14.000
We have to find the kids.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.130
Let's go.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.970
Guys! Guys!

08:23.060 --> 08:24.900
They're coming!

08:24.900 --> 08:26.740
‐Come on! ‐Go, go, go, go!

08:39.220 --> 08:42.179
I'm hungry.
I'm so hungry, guys.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.310
Let's try and find
a liquor store or something.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.030
Sounds nourishing.

08:47.030 --> 08:49.240
I'm more concerned
how hungry she is.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.390
<i>Unit 36, code three,
one Adam 22.</i>

09:03.390 --> 09:06.150
Just relax.
Nothing going on here.

09:06.150 --> 09:07.780
We have to get off the streets.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.700
<i>‐We're ten out. ‐Copy that.</i>

09:43.520 --> 09:45.440
What are we supposed to do now?

09:45.440 --> 09:48.940
Oh, I can't think. I need sleep.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.700
Who the hell can sleep?

09:50.700 --> 09:52.580
Actually, I'm still
a little wiped out.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.000
And when we wake up?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.340
What happens then?

09:59.340 --> 10:01.010
‐We get out of town.
‐We save Karolina.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.140
Wait, you'd seriously
leave without her?

10:05.140 --> 10:06.900
Look, Nico,

10:06.900 --> 10:09.940
we don't know where she is
or how she is.

10:09.940 --> 10:14.200
Or if... she still even is.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.790
Look, I'm sorry,
but we have to do
what's best for the group.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.090
No, I say we have
to think about each other.

10:19.090 --> 10:21.800
If it was me in her place,
I'd want you guys to go.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.720
Well, if it was you
in her place, we would.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.680
But it's not.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.190
Remember? It's Karolina, okay?

10:29.190 --> 10:32.240
She did everything
she could to protect us.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.580
That's true.

10:35.580 --> 10:38.830
Last night, Karolina
could've saved herself,

10:38.830 --> 10:40.300
but she didn't.

10:40.300 --> 10:44.300
I see what's happening here.
I like it.

10:44.300 --> 10:47.020
Screw it.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.390
Me too.

10:52.490 --> 10:57.000
Okay. We look for her.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.090
Shh! Quiet, girl.

11:02.090 --> 11:05.100
We've been played.
That much is obvious.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.470
We all thought
we were equals in this.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.440
Turns out there's
an inner circle.

11:09.440 --> 11:13.240
Jonah, Leslie, and now Karolina.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.660
Don't forget
about Leslie's beard, Frank.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.790
Did you two know that Molly
had that strength?

11:19.790 --> 11:22.130
No! We were shocked.

11:22.130 --> 11:25.340
And how do we know that Jonah
isn't her father, too?

11:25.340 --> 11:29.060
Alice? No chance. Gross.

11:29.060 --> 11:31.570
I always thought
it was a miracle that Molly
survived that night.

11:31.570 --> 11:35.620
Well, she's either
always been strong,

11:35.620 --> 11:38.660
or something happened
in that explosion.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.130
Tina, what do you know?

11:44.010 --> 11:46.010
Think it's time
you own up to being there.

11:47.430 --> 11:50.480
For the last time,
I wasn't at the lab.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.320
But Leslie was.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.880
Tina.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.260
I didn't know
what she was going to do.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.890
I just knew
that she was handling it,

12:09.890 --> 12:11.060
and I let her.

12:12.310 --> 12:13.570
I'm sorry.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.570
Molly could've died
that night, too!

12:15.570 --> 12:17.740
Leslie did not know that
she was going to be there.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.870
She was supposed
to be sleeping at home.

12:19.870 --> 12:23.380
The kids have pieced
at least some
of this together.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.460
That's why they were
at the dig site.

12:25.460 --> 12:29.510
We have put them
in so much danger.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.600
What the hell is down there?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.190
"Clean, renewable energy
source," right?

12:34.190 --> 12:36.360
Make us rich, save the world.

12:36.360 --> 12:40.410
All right, look, why don't
we just go down there,
take a look ourselves.

12:40.410 --> 12:43.080
Yeah. We kept some
of Gene and Alice's equipment.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.170
And what about the kids?

12:45.170 --> 12:46.760
If we turn the cops on them,

12:46.760 --> 12:49.720
they'll just think
they're in trouble...

12:49.720 --> 12:51.730
make them even less likely
to come home.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.230
They're too smart to use
their cell phones
or their credit cards.

12:54.230 --> 12:55.860
Well, we can find one of them.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.150
Karolina may not know
where they are,

12:58.150 --> 13:00.080
but she can tell us
what they know.

13:10.720 --> 13:16.360
How could you go to him,
betray us like that?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.690
Betray?

13:17.690 --> 13:19.660
I think you're the expert
in that field.

13:21.990 --> 13:23.000
Mind‐wiping me...

13:24.080 --> 13:25.580
Don't deny it, Leslie.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.210
And then having a child with...

13:28.210 --> 13:30.220
I don't even know what he is.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.260
But you do.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.930
He's the One.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.600
Yeah, well, I am her father,

13:35.600 --> 13:36.940
not him.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.490
I raised her.

13:39.490 --> 13:40.990
She loves me,

13:40.990 --> 13:42.990
and he loves whatever
the hell's in that hole.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.080
He was willing to hurt
her to protect it.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.460
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.670
Do you?

13:55.980 --> 13:58.940
There's no need for concern.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.070
Her healing's coming along
quite nicely.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.590
It was a long night.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.760
Why don't you head home
and get some rest.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.810
She's safe with me.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.490
Let us know when she wakes up.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.830
So, we're going undercover.

14:46.830 --> 14:47.750
Try this.

14:50.670 --> 14:51.590
Thanks.

14:54.010 --> 14:56.270
So, you want to talk about it?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.690
Talk about what?

14:57.690 --> 15:00.150
Well, when we found you
at the dance last night,

15:00.150 --> 15:01.900
you reeked of hookup.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.110
Yeah? Well, so did you.

15:04.110 --> 15:07.790
Relax, I'm not
gonna tell Wilder.

15:07.790 --> 15:10.380
Though it does explain
why Karolina wasn't into me.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.210
I knew there had to be
a good reason.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.180
Well, what about the girl
who is into you?

15:19.600 --> 15:21.020
It's complicated.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.320
Right, because she
really likes you.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.240
No...

15:28.370 --> 15:29.790
Because I really like her.

15:35.220 --> 15:38.060
Um, not really flying
under the radar.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.940
Alex said "undercover,"
not invisible.

15:43.940 --> 15:47.030
Oh, my gosh, this wig
is perfect for Gert.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.830
They're gonna be expecting
a girl with purple hair,
not green.

15:51.670 --> 15:54.460
Oh, look at us.
Brentwood's finest,

15:54.460 --> 15:57.010
wearing crap
other people threw away.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.970
The struggle is real.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.490
Where were you?

16:05.490 --> 16:07.280
That was quite a journey.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.000
I went down
to Hollywood Boulevard
hoping I could find someone

16:10.000 --> 16:12.330
at a coffee shop who
would lend me their laptop.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.630
And instead?

16:13.630 --> 16:17.050
Instead I saw
several grown men urinating.

16:17.050 --> 16:20.220
I had to stop a fistfight
between two shoeless meth heads

16:20.220 --> 16:22.730
fighting over an empty
cottage cheese container.

16:22.730 --> 16:25.780
Oh, and if you want
a tour of stars' homes

16:25.780 --> 16:28.780
or catch a double feature,
I can hook you up.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.870
Oh, I love old movies.

16:30.870 --> 16:33.210
Also, there's a map
of the church in here,

16:33.210 --> 16:35.420
handed out by an alcoholic Elmo.

16:41.810 --> 16:43.230
Wow.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.570
Did you know a chicken
costs eight bucks?

16:45.570 --> 16:47.110
Mm, you had to go
to Whole Foods.

16:47.110 --> 16:48.950
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.250
We need to save every cent
we have with us,

16:51.250 --> 16:52.790
but I need to keep her fed,

16:52.790 --> 16:54.920
or honestly I don't know
what's gonna happen.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.340
Phase one
of the mission's complete.

16:57.340 --> 17:01.220
‐What's next?
‐Uh, what's next is goodbye.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.600
Someone isn't coming
on the rest of the mission.

17:04.859 --> 17:07.859
What? But she's good!

17:07.859 --> 17:11.160
She‐‐ she doesn't
chase squirrels.
She poops in the trees.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.000
We're a team!

17:13.000 --> 17:15.170
Okay, let's at least vote on it.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.089
Molly?

17:22.180 --> 17:23.730
It's not safe, Gert.

17:25.349 --> 17:27.150
We'll get caught, or she will.

17:40.590 --> 17:45.520
So, we're gonna be moving
around, on the road a lot,

17:45.520 --> 17:48.610
and you don't exactly fit
inside a duffel bag.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.670
It's as much for you
as it is for me.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.300
You're special.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.920
One of a kind.

18:01.890 --> 18:03.560
It's important that you survive.

18:09.570 --> 18:12.620
You need to stay hidden
during the day, hunt at night.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.490
Be friends
with a mountain lion, okay?

18:16.460 --> 18:18.420
When things calm down,
I'll come for you.

18:21.220 --> 18:22.510
I'll find you.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.470
We have a connection.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.650
You're the Costello
to my Abbott.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.620
The Harpo to my Groucho.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.630
The old lace to my arsenic.

18:50.570 --> 18:51.860
Goodbye, Old Lace.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.300
"Yawn"? My name is Vaughn.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.890
What parent names
their child "Yawn"?

19:24.890 --> 19:27.520
Not to mention,
I come in here every day...

19:27.520 --> 19:32.530
Excuse me! Mistake! That's mine.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.660
Oh. What the hell is this?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.080
Six shots of espresso.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.790
Don't judge me.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.760
Caffeine is the only vice
I have left.

19:45.260 --> 19:46.470
What is this?

19:46.470 --> 19:49.600
We're friends of Karolina's.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.650
She's in trouble.
We need your help.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.610
What happened? Is she okay?

19:53.610 --> 19:56.700
We don't know.
 We think she's being held in the church.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.080
Well, I'll call Leslie.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.290
She's a part of it.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.050
Part of... what?

20:03.050 --> 20:05.010
You ever notice
that every year

20:05.010 --> 20:07.010
one of your young parishioners
goes missing?

20:08.470 --> 20:10.350
They're runaways.

20:10.350 --> 20:13.780
Sometimes they,
you know, run away.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.110
Yeah, except these kids
aren't coming back.

20:16.110 --> 20:20.540
Same time of year, every year.

20:20.540 --> 20:24.380
- ‐That doesn't mean that...
- ‐ Karolina might be next?

20:24.380 --> 20:26.760
Leslie wouldn't hurt
one of her congregants,

20:26.760 --> 20:28.260
let alone her own daughter.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.470
Maybe not,
but that weirdo Jonah would.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.810
He's in control now, not Leslie.

20:32.810 --> 20:36.610
Jonah?
Leslie's father's friend?

20:36.610 --> 20:39.160
Look, every day I come to work

20:39.160 --> 20:41.710
at the church
is a day I feel at home.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.630
The Deans are my family,

20:44.630 --> 20:47.260
and the Gibborim,
it helped get my life together

20:47.260 --> 20:49.390
when no one else would.

20:49.390 --> 20:52.440
Now a bunch of weird kids
in bad wigs

20:52.440 --> 20:53.690
tell me it's all a sham?

20:56.610 --> 20:58.110
Can I have my coffee back?

20:58.110 --> 20:59.870
‐No chance, dude.
‐Absolutely not.

20:59.870 --> 21:02.330
‐Brainwashed dick.
‐I think I might
actually like this.

21:25.710 --> 21:26.920
Where are my friends?

21:28.010 --> 21:29.130
Your friends are fine...

21:30.220 --> 21:32.060
for now.

21:32.060 --> 21:33.390
No need to worry about them.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.230
I want to see my dad.

21:36.230 --> 21:38.900
Frank has done
a wonderful job raising you.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.660
I will always
be grateful to him,

21:42.660 --> 21:44.580
but I think you know the truth.

21:48.260 --> 21:49.550
I'm your father.

21:51.260 --> 21:53.520
You're a smart girl, Karolina,

21:53.520 --> 21:55.690
always hungry for answers.

21:57.690 --> 21:59.530
I think last night you got them.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.120
I realize how difficult
it must be,

22:05.120 --> 22:08.250
discovering the truth
about yourself
with no one to guide you,

22:08.250 --> 22:11.720
no one who truly understands.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.310
Unfortunately, the truth
can make you very lonely.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.400
But now...

22:19.400 --> 22:21.820
now for the first time
in such a long time...

22:24.580 --> 22:27.120
I don't feel quite so alone.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.760
Maybe I could give
you that gift.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.270
Just come check it out...

22:39.360 --> 22:40.990
just for a couple of days.

22:40.990 --> 22:43.280
Safe place to sleep,
take a shower...

22:45.910 --> 22:47.960
Plenty of room for everybody.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.290
Come on.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.710
Plenty of room.

22:52.220 --> 22:54.050
Can't believe
I almost missed you.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.040
Do you know
how sonar equipment even works?

23:10.130 --> 23:11.710
Of course. Sure I do.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.970
Kinda.

23:14.970 --> 23:18.520
Gene and I used to mess around
with reflected sound waves,

23:18.520 --> 23:20.980
throw a few back just for fun.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.070
I miss those guys.

23:22.070 --> 23:24.410
And all this time

23:24.410 --> 23:26.450
it was Leslie
who was responsible.

23:26.450 --> 23:29.000
I'd like to kill
that bitch myself.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.250
Not to mention all the energy
we wasted hating Tina.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.260
Ugh.

23:33.260 --> 23:36.350
Okay, here we go.

23:36.350 --> 23:38.220
Let's see what the hell
is down there.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.810
Here we go.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.020
Hey.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.860
What are you guys doing?

23:44.860 --> 23:47.660
‐Uh... uh... ‐We were just...

23:47.660 --> 23:49.210
‐We're just checking
out the site.
‐Wanted to make sure

23:49.210 --> 23:51.130
that there wasn't
a lot of damage.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.460
‐lt's good, though.
‐The site. We're checking
on the site.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.890
It's good. What are you doing?

23:57.180 --> 24:01.100
Same. What exactly
are you guys doing?

24:01.100 --> 24:04.690
‐What do you mean, what exactly?
‐Are you familiar
with seismic refraction?

24:04.690 --> 24:08.660
‐...fraction?
Or maybe echo‐sounding?
‐No. Just tell me.

24:10.410 --> 24:11.330
Hon?

24:14.590 --> 24:16.720
That can't be right, can it?

24:16.720 --> 24:19.140
What? What are you looking at?

24:19.140 --> 24:20.690
There's something down there.

24:21.770 --> 24:24.360
Yeah, obviously. Jonah told us.

24:24.360 --> 24:30.410
No, Leslie, whatever's
down there, it's... alive?

24:33.210 --> 24:34.460
You didn't know?

24:40.060 --> 24:43.350
So I guess Jonah
keeps secrets from you, too.

24:59.010 --> 25:01.220
Contact in case
of emergency?

25:01.220 --> 25:02.980
Just write N/A.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.230
That means I don't have
any family, though.

25:05.230 --> 25:06.150
Bingo.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.120
Do you think that's
what Destiny wrote?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.950
That's what they all wrote.

25:11.950 --> 25:14.500
It's not a lie,
though, not for me.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.960
It's not too far
from the truth for me, either.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.890
At least you still have a chance
that your dad might be okay.

25:19.890 --> 25:22.470
Yeah, but you get to believe
your parents were heroes.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.770
Can I get you to come with me?

25:25.770 --> 25:27.780
Does this mean
you've changed your mind?

25:27.780 --> 25:29.150
Or that you're busting us.

25:29.150 --> 25:32.370
It means stop talking
and follow me... now.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.140
Vaughn? Surprised
to see you down here.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.020
Is there a problem?

25:43.020 --> 25:44.270
No.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.020
Not at all.

25:46.020 --> 25:50.160
It's just that there's something
special about these two.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.080
Leslie will be
very interested in them.

25:56.040 --> 26:00.800
They're special, indeed.
Leslie will be very happy.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.390
You're about to meet someone
who will change your life.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.730
I wish I could trade places
with you right now.

26:20.170 --> 26:21.890
Okay, once they
find Karolina,

26:21.890 --> 26:24.100
they lead her out here
and we're home free.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.100
If they find her.

26:26.810 --> 26:28.770
We'll work
on our positive attitude.

26:28.770 --> 26:30.110
That ought to go well.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.030
I'm gonna go find us a ride.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.260
Sorry, uh, sometimes I can...

26:40.260 --> 26:42.640
be a little...

26:42.640 --> 26:44.140
I suffer from anxiety.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.230
Don't they have meds for that?

26:47.230 --> 26:50.320
Yeah, got a whole bottle
of them sitting at home.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.120
And it's also my first day
without my emotional
support dinosaur, so...

26:56.120 --> 26:57.620
Yeah, I'll be fine.

27:01.720 --> 27:06.850
I mean, even if this does work
and we do get Karolina,

27:06.850 --> 27:08.940
then what?

27:08.940 --> 27:10.480
Where do we go?

27:10.480 --> 27:12.950
You think our parents
are just gonna let us disappear?

27:12.950 --> 27:15.030
Not a chance.
They're gonna come after us.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.870
Hey, just one step at a time.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.120
And what, we're all just
gonna live together?

27:19.120 --> 27:20.710
Like in a commune or some shit?

27:20.710 --> 27:22.460
Like that won't be
totally awkward?

27:22.460 --> 27:25.430
No, but I thought
that you'd be into that.

27:25.430 --> 27:27.430
Hotel room time with Chase?

27:30.360 --> 27:31.900
It was a one‐time thing.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.030
Oh. Okay.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.540
Mm, but that's not what he said.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.340
It's not? What did he say?

27:43.340 --> 27:46.720
That, well, he really
likes you, and he...

27:46.720 --> 27:49.640
Are you sure he was
talking about me?
Not that it matters.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.820
Yeah, it does.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.780
It matters a lot, actually.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.830
If nothing else, you know,
someone should

27:57.830 --> 28:00.330
come out of all of this
with a healthy relationship.

28:12.230 --> 28:13.150
Thank you.

28:15.610 --> 28:19.490
I'm sorry you came all this way,
but, uh, Leslie isn't here.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.170
We didn't come to see her.

28:21.170 --> 28:22.920
We came to see Karolina.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.340
We have some questions
concerning our kids.

28:25.340 --> 28:26.840
Oh, I completely understand.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.060
Nobody wants to find
those kids more than I do,

28:29.060 --> 28:31.940
but Karolina
is still in recovery.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.940
When she's well enough,
I'll let you know.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.990
Not good enough.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.540
Our son is missing.

28:44.460 --> 28:47.640
This isn't
some street corner in Compton.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.140
You don't just walk in here
and make demands.

28:57.990 --> 28:59.910
You need to trust me.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.120
Can you do that?

29:07.090 --> 29:08.800
Hmm.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.230
Well, I think we should
all take a moment

29:12.230 --> 29:14.350
to reconsider our agreement.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.830
Do make sure you get
your parking validated.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.120
First two hours are free.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.650
That's it! We don't work
for him anymore.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.950
‐Consequences be damned.
‐I'm with you.

29:39.950 --> 29:41.790
You think we should
reach out to the others?

29:41.790 --> 29:43.250
I don't know
who to trust anymore.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.830
I say we lock it down.

29:44.830 --> 29:47.590
Find Alex before Jonah does.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.730
Wow, that was crazy.

29:56.730 --> 29:59.400
I can't believe
Aura and Frances bought it.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.830
Oh, God, I think I'm gonna puke.

30:04.450 --> 30:06.250
This is Leslie's
private chamber.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.460
If Karolina is anywhere,
she's in there.

30:08.460 --> 30:11.220
The problem is,
only Leslie knows the code.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.220
No problem. I brought
a codebreaker.

30:18.780 --> 30:19.860
Aah!

30:19.860 --> 30:22.030
Shit! Oh!

30:22.030 --> 30:23.410
Now I'm freaking out.

30:23.410 --> 30:24.790
Yup, I'm walking away!

30:24.790 --> 30:26.120
Walking away and pretending

30:26.120 --> 30:27.710
I did not bring a monster
into my church.

30:27.710 --> 30:29.960
‐Karolina. ‐You okay?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.390
Oh, I don't even know
what that means anymore.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.850
You don't look so good.

30:33.850 --> 30:35.350
I'm just a little weak.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.310
I didn't think
I'd ever see you guys again.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.900
We're not leaving
anyone behind. Come on.

30:40.860 --> 30:42.740
Pretend I'm showing you around.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.080
This is a tour.
Perfectly normal.

30:47.670 --> 30:49.290
Karolina.

30:52.380 --> 30:53.970
Get security.

30:53.970 --> 30:56.270
What? No. There's no problem.
These are my friends.

30:56.270 --> 30:58.190
‐Security, fourth floor.
‐Karolina, you're lying.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.820
‐They're coming. ‐Time to run!

30:59.820 --> 31:01.610
‐Come on! ‐Go, go, go!

31:09.790 --> 31:11.340
‐Come on! ‐Come on!

31:12.680 --> 31:14.850
‐ln here!
‐Can't get out that way.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.250
Let's see if there's
any more of them.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.360
Ugh!

31:41.360 --> 31:43.860
What did you see?

31:43.860 --> 31:45.280
I'm not sure.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.990
‐Come on. Let's go. ‐Come on.

31:57.430 --> 31:58.560
Yes!

31:58.560 --> 32:00.310
All right, five, I'm going in!

32:05.400 --> 32:07.790
‐Karolina!
‐Karolina, get in, get in.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.080
Karolina, you okay?

32:09.080 --> 32:10.920
‐Did they hurt you?
‐Holy shit, that was‐‐

32:10.920 --> 32:12.380
‐I just need to do this.
‐Get the door!

32:12.380 --> 32:13.300
‐Go! ‐Go!

32:14.800 --> 32:17.510
They made it. Karolina
and her friends got away.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.360
Thank you
for coming to me, Vaughn.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.990
I cherish your loyalty.

32:24.990 --> 32:28.080
Sure. Sure.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.960
They mentioned Jonah
was in charge now.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.210
That's not right, is it?

32:35.880 --> 32:36.800
No.

32:38.010 --> 32:39.680
That's not right at all.

33:16.670 --> 33:18.550
How long do you think
it'd take to walk home?

33:20.470 --> 33:24.230
Alex, you know we're
never going back, right?

33:24.230 --> 33:25.520
Yeah, I know, it's just...

33:28.530 --> 33:30.410
You think you'd ever
call your parents?

33:31.490 --> 33:34.040
Just to... say whatever?

33:39.260 --> 33:40.850
I've got nothing to say.

34:00.090 --> 34:05.520
What you did
for us was... was epic.

34:05.520 --> 34:09.360
Yeah, well,
what you guys did for me
was pretty epic, too.

34:11.570 --> 34:12.780
You should've run.

34:14.409 --> 34:15.830
Some of us wanted to.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.760
But not you.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.350
Nope, not me.

34:46.139 --> 34:47.060
Where's Alex?

34:49.070 --> 34:50.230
I don't know.

34:50.230 --> 34:53.159
He was here
a minute ago.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.790
Oh, my God.

34:54.790 --> 34:57.120
That little shit went
and called his parents.

35:11.440 --> 35:15.740
And when you drill a giant hole,
you hit rocks, maybe oil,

35:15.740 --> 35:18.290
but not a lifeform.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.800
How does something this big

35:21.800 --> 35:24.010
go undetected for so long,

35:24.010 --> 35:25.720
let alone survive?

35:25.720 --> 35:26.970
What does it eat?

35:26.970 --> 35:28.640
How does it breathe?

35:28.640 --> 35:31.230
Its version of living is
something we don't understand.

35:34.910 --> 35:36.410
Unless we do.

35:38.830 --> 35:40.380
The serum...

35:40.380 --> 35:42.630
that Jonah used on Victor...

35:42.630 --> 35:44.180
for his brain tumor?

35:44.180 --> 35:46.390
This is based on his DNA!

35:46.390 --> 35:48.680
So, assuming...

35:48.680 --> 35:51.480
that this thing is
somehow related to him,

35:51.480 --> 35:55.030
if we figure out
what makes him tick...

35:55.030 --> 35:57.950
Maybe we can figure out
how to stop the clock.

36:00.830 --> 36:05.550
Jonah may have just
given us the very thing
that we need to kill him.

36:06.850 --> 36:09.140
Yeah, and whatever
is down there...

36:39.790 --> 36:42.250
All right,
you little homie, I came.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.050
Now, you gonna tell me
what's going on

36:44.050 --> 36:46.630
with that school and those
crazy‐ass friends of yours?

36:47.760 --> 36:49.510
I need something first.

36:52.310 --> 36:56.280
And you think I'll help you why?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.910
Well, you know what they say.

36:58.910 --> 37:01.250
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.630
Is that right?

37:06.880 --> 37:08.720
Then I guess we tight as hell.

37:12.270 --> 37:15.110
I'm not sure if there's anything
to talk about, Leslie.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.530
Yeah, trust level
is pretty low right now.

37:17.530 --> 37:19.120
It's less than zero,

37:19.120 --> 37:21.450
and I'm not just talking
about me and Janet.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.720
I understand
what I've done...

37:33.390 --> 37:34.770
and I want to fix it.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.410
I asked the Wilders to join,
but they wouldn't.

37:39.410 --> 37:41.830
They said they were
focusing on finding Alex
and nothing more.

37:41.830 --> 37:43.830
‐I get it. ‐Me too.

37:43.830 --> 37:45.540
I also get it, but we're putting

37:45.540 --> 37:47.800
our suspicions aside
for the sake of our kids.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.220
What about Frank?

37:52.100 --> 37:54.440
I don't actually know
where his loyalties lie.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.150
So, what is
the purpose of this meeting?

37:58.150 --> 38:03.080
We have a common enemy,
and we need to do
something about it.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.630
Well, from what I saw,
you are sleeping with the enemy.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.720
What he did to Karolina
and the other kids...

38:12.720 --> 38:16.610
Not to mention what we found
at the bottom of the dig site.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.820
He's been
using all of us.

38:18.820 --> 38:20.030
‐You think? ‐No shit!

38:20.030 --> 38:21.410
He's been
controlling us all

38:21.410 --> 38:23.240
since before the kids were born.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.250
And that stops now.
We're fighting back.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.550
But he's got Victor's life
in his hands.

38:28.550 --> 38:31.380
Jonah needs Victor healthy.
He said as much.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.180
He's not gonna let him die.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.180
It's your call.
If you want out...

38:35.180 --> 38:38.690
No. Tina's right.

38:39.780 --> 38:40.860
I'm... I'm here.

38:46.250 --> 38:49.040
Before moving forward,
I just need to say...

38:52.640 --> 38:54.680
I've made some mistakes
in my life...

38:56.310 --> 38:58.190
terrible mistakes.

38:58.190 --> 39:00.110
Gene and Alice.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.280
Tina told us.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.080
And worse.

39:18.310 --> 39:19.310
No.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.320
How could you?

39:23.400 --> 39:26.290
When Amy hacked your server,

39:26.290 --> 39:28.790
she set off an alarm.

39:28.790 --> 39:31.210
Well, I know.
I got it right away.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.630
So did Jonah.

39:35.720 --> 39:39.190
‐Amy saw the...
‐The sacrifice tapes.
I don't think so.

39:40.270 --> 39:43.950
But Jonah wanted to be sure.

39:43.950 --> 39:46.580
He said he was going
to just talk to her,

39:46.580 --> 39:48.620
find out what she knew,

39:48.620 --> 39:50.460
scare her enough to keep quiet.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.420
I didn't believe him.

39:52.420 --> 39:55.550
I‐I sent her a text hoping
that she would get it
in time, but...

39:59.810 --> 40:04.320
I don't actually know...
what happened.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.330
I do.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.460
Jonah murdered my daughter.

40:14.420 --> 40:16.510
She was looking
for Wizard secrets,

40:16.510 --> 40:18.510
not PRIDE's.

40:20.390 --> 40:21.980
She died for nothing!

40:24.740 --> 40:26.160
And you knew.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.460
You knew all this time!

40:32.210 --> 40:36.510
I loved him. I trusted him.

40:36.510 --> 40:39.260
We‐‐ we were working
toward something bigger.

40:40.890 --> 40:41.900
It just...

40:43.440 --> 40:44.860
happened.

40:56.090 --> 40:58.760
If we killed you tonight
in this basement...

40:59.850 --> 41:01.600
no one would ever know.

41:06.490 --> 41:07.990
But then you wouldn't be able

41:07.990 --> 41:09.780
to get close enough
to kill Jonah...

41:11.660 --> 41:14.380
and that's why we're
all here, isn't it?

41:36.090 --> 41:38.880
I'm glad you were able
to set aside your anger.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.030
I think you'll find
we both want the same thing.

41:56.710 --> 42:00.970
For Karolina's safety,
I'd do anything.

42:02.510 --> 42:04.730
As will I.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.270
Our future together
is gonna be very bright.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.680
And once he's back on his feet,

42:21.680 --> 42:27.440
things will get very...
very interesting.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.170
So, where were you?

43:23.930 --> 43:25.810
Just had to make a call.

43:25.810 --> 43:26.930
Your parents?

43:27.940 --> 43:29.480
Definitely not.

43:30.940 --> 43:31.900
Who, then?

43:33.700 --> 43:36.950
It doesn't matter.
I got what I needed.

43:42.970 --> 43:46.260
Well, that...
must be some friend.

43:48.140 --> 43:49.060
Yeah.

43:54.910 --> 43:57.200
You can't will
that thing to ring.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.830
Believe me, I've tried.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.630
I'm not waiting for it to ring.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.390
I'm about to make a call...

44:06.390 --> 44:08.270
a call that'll change
everything.

44:09.350 --> 44:11.060
What do you mean?

44:11.060 --> 44:13.030
We can't risk Alex getting hurt,

44:13.030 --> 44:15.240
or any of those kids.
None of this is their fault.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.580
I know.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.580
That's why I'm gonna
get them to safety.

44:20.670 --> 44:22.670
And then, we go to war.

44:28.010 --> 44:31.560
<i>...boarding</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

44:40.660 --> 44:43.290
I'm on lookout.
And get some good snacks.

44:52.770 --> 44:54.690
Well, there's not much
to choose from.

44:56.700 --> 44:58.910
It's not too late
to change our minds.

44:58.910 --> 45:00.910
Yeah, it is.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.500
I say Phoenix.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.220
Does Arizona like brown people?
I don't think they do.

45:08.220 --> 45:11.060
Just pick whatever's
leaving soonest.

45:30.680 --> 45:31.600
Uhh!

45:33.480 --> 45:34.520
Lace?

45:37.650 --> 45:39.200
Hi! Old Lace! Hey!

45:39.200 --> 45:41.240
Were you following me?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.160
Oh!

45:43.500 --> 45:45.040
Can you get botulism?

45:45.040 --> 45:47.050
Because this is
really disgusting.

45:47.050 --> 45:49.050
And, oh, your breath...

45:49.050 --> 45:50.600
It...

45:50.600 --> 45:52.980
Well, who cares. Okay.

45:52.980 --> 45:57.070
Uh, we need to figure out
how to get you into cargo.

45:58.490 --> 46:00.030
I'll be back.

46:00.030 --> 46:01.490
Okay, get down. Get down.

46:05.290 --> 46:08.010
Guys! Guys! You're never
gonna guess who's here.

46:08.010 --> 46:09.300
‐Old Lace! ‐Who's Old Lace?

46:09.300 --> 46:10.680
My dinosaur. That's her name.
