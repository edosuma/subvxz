00:45.378 --> 00:46.709
Help!

00:46.780 --> 00:48.611
Help!

00:48.681 --> 00:50.046
Ugh!

00:50.116 --> 00:52.209
Somebody help me!

00:52.285 --> 00:54.981
Ohh!
Somebody help me!

01:10.437 --> 01:11.836
"Hell's version of Robin Hood. "

01:11.905 --> 01:13.270
That's how the grounds keeper
put it.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.704
He discovered the body
this morning.

01:14.774 --> 01:15.934
- Any witnesses?
- None.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.239
And we've combed this place
stem to sternum.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.108
- Stern.
- Stern?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.808
The expression is
"stem to stern," not sternum.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.112
Well, we'll have to agree
to disagree on that one, sir.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.380
At any rate, the killer seems to
have done an excellent job

01:27.454 --> 01:28.386
of covering his tracks.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.116
It's like he's vanished
into thin air.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.179
Nonsense, George.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.485
The laws of physics dictate

01:32.559 --> 01:34.424
that anytime two objects
make contact,

01:34.494 --> 01:35.722
trace materials are exchanged.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.285
Therefore, a killer always
leaves a calling card.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.421
No doubt, sir.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.193
But I was about to say
that it's our victim

01:40.266 --> 01:41.824
who's left us
the most interesting clue.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.027
Ah.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.570
Very good, George.

01:44.637 --> 01:45.831
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning, Doctor.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.566
Our victim's goodbye letter.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.107
Hmm. "W.Y."

01:49.175 --> 01:50.301
What does it mean?

01:50.376 --> 01:52.139
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.839
Unfortunately, Dr. Grout died

01:53.913 --> 01:55.437
before he had a chance
to finish.

01:55.515 --> 01:56.504
Doctor?

01:56.583 --> 01:58.551
- Did you know him?
- By reputation.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.550
Francis Grout.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.814
He's one of the founders
of the Greyson Institute.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.822
Oh, yes.
What is it exactly?

02:03.890 --> 02:05.221
It's a research center
for the brain.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.315
It's very well-respected,

02:06.392 --> 02:08.121
with a reputation
for pushing the boundaries

02:08.193 --> 02:09.786
of conventional thought.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.888
I should think you'd be
right at home here.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.896
Standard crossbow arrows.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.529
Robbery likely wasn't
the motive.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.505
What does it all mean, sir?

02:20.573 --> 02:21.904
I don't know.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.103
It seems as though the killer
hunted his victim

02:25.178 --> 02:26.338
like an animal.

02:26.412 --> 02:29.506
I mean, why so elaborate?
With arrows and all?

02:29.582 --> 02:32.517
Arrows are silent.
Less likely to draw attention.

02:32.585 --> 02:35.520
Or maybe the killer
was making a statement.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.078
The use of arrows would suggest

02:37.157 --> 02:39.182
the killer had a flair
for the dramatic.

02:39.259 --> 02:40.886
It's rather well-executed, then.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.451
If you pardon the pun.

02:44.964 --> 02:49.492
So, sir, what's our next move?

02:54.874 --> 02:57.968
Every patient, every doctor,
every orderly.

02:58.044 --> 03:00.569
I want every name associated
with Dr. Grout

03:00.647 --> 03:02.080
or this Greyson Institute

03:02.148 --> 03:03.979
searched for the initials "W.Y."

03:04.050 --> 03:06.985
Oh, and, Higgins, look into
the hunting and archery clubs.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.486
See if anyone's familiar
with those arrows.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.614
- Very good, sir.
- And remember, "W.Y."

03:10.690 --> 03:11.622
Sir, if I may.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.990
What if "W.Y." are not initials
but part of a larger word?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.824
Like "Wyoming" or...

03:16.896 --> 03:19.490
Gentlemen, why not consider
the possibility

03:19.566 --> 03:21.158
that it could be either?

03:21.234 --> 03:23.293
- Sir.
- Murdoch.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.098
Someone in your office
to see you.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.729
She says she wants to help you
with the case.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.603
- A witness?
- Well, sort of.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.836
Sort of?

03:30.910 --> 03:32.741
- Sarah Pensall.
- The medium.

03:32.812 --> 03:36.043
Maybe she has another message
for you from beyond.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.314
Hello, Miss Pensall.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.579
I understand you might have
some information for...

03:40.653 --> 03:42.052
I know who killed the doctor.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.783
- You do?
- He keeps coming to me.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.825
- Who does?
- Again and again.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.487
The hooded figure.
Like the Grim Reaper.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.029
The Grim Reaper.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.156
I know it sounds absurd.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.861
But I knew he was going to kill
a doctor, and now he has.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.368
And I've seen other deaths, too.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.304
These other deaths,
tell me about them.

04:02.942 --> 04:06.844
They... They happen at night.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.507
Always with an arrow.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.245
I can't seem to make out
the other victims.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.548
Except for the final one.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.454
And who is that?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.891
It's you.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.263
The visions come to me
in fragments,

04:30.336 --> 04:32.566
in bits and pieces.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.072
The reaper is angry.

04:37.043 --> 04:42.242
And his... his face is obscured
by a... by a dark hood.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.215
And you're sure
he'll strike again?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.411
Yes, but there's someone else.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.544
Who?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.383
There's a spirit of a woman.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.980
I know there's a connection
between her and the reaper,

04:52.058 --> 04:53.423
but I don't know what.

04:53.493 --> 04:54.721
I see.

04:54.794 --> 05:00.289
Dr. Grout wrote the letters
"W.Y." before he died.

05:00.366 --> 05:03.233
Does that mean anything to you?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.397
No.
Yes, I'm not sure.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.167
It seems familiar,
but in what context?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.072
So, you don't know
what the letters mean,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.374
the figure you see
is obscured by a cloak,

05:13.446 --> 05:16.904
you can't say who it is
or where it will strike next,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.577
and you think the woman trying
to reach you is connected,

05:19.652 --> 05:21.347
but you're not sure.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.049
I may not know everything,
but I know this.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.249
You are in danger.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.260
Please believe me.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.694
Thank you, Miss Pensall.

05:30.763 --> 05:33.163
I will take this information
most seriously.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.503
Constable, could you please see
Miss Pensall home?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.835
Mm-hmm.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.778
So?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.842
She's been having visions.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.720
Something about more murders to
come and a cloaked Grim Reaper.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.314
The reaper?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.121
What are we going to be looking
for next?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.286
Frankenstein?
Mr. Hyde?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.388
I'm taking her words
with caution.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.558
She does have a tendency
to embellish.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.431
However, on occasion,
she has proven very accurate.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.664
It would be foolish of us
to simply dismiss her.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.263
What did she have to say?

06:14.340 --> 06:18.436
As usual, the details
were somewhat hazy.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.309
Surely, she must have given you
more than just a man in a hood.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.349
Nothing.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.543
What about the future murders?
Did she say who?

06:25.618 --> 06:27.677
I'm afraid not.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.018
Now, if you'll excuse me...

06:30.089 --> 06:31.283
Well, if one of our constables

06:31.357 --> 06:32.790
does happen to bump
into the Grim Reaper,

06:32.859 --> 06:35.589
make sure they bring him
back here for a chat.

06:35.661 --> 06:39.119
Bloody hell, it was never
like this in Yorkshire.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.068
I've completed my examination,
Detective.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.972
It would seem that Dr. Grout's
cause of death was...

06:50.410 --> 06:53.311
...the three arrows
jutting out of his back.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.205
That was a joke, William.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.512
Sorry.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.052
Something on your mind?

07:02.021 --> 07:03.079
You'll think it absurd.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.021
Well, that's never
stopped you before.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.082
Do you believe in destiny?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.924
A weighty topic
for an afternoon's postmortem.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.224
Yes, well, normally,

07:11.297 --> 07:13.458
I take comfort
in knowing God has a plan.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.967
However, when that plan
involves my demise...

07:16.035 --> 07:18.663
Your demise? What on earth
are you talking about, William?

07:18.738 --> 07:19.966
Miss Pensall came by today.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.336
- The medium?
- Yes.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.534
Said she had a vision.
About me.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.510
That I was fated to die.

07:26.579 --> 07:30.242
Well, you mustn't confuse
the words of a medium

07:30.316 --> 07:32.147
with the words of God.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.480
Yes, so, what do we have?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.384
Something quite interesting.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.253
The first two arrows missed
the vital organs completely,

07:38.324 --> 07:40.485
but the third directly pierced
the aorta.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.460
So death would have been
instantaneous?

07:42.528 --> 07:43.460
Precisely.

07:43.529 --> 07:44.826
But for that kind of accuracy,

07:44.897 --> 07:46.888
the killer must have been
virtually standing over him.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.627
So, the perpetrator
must have seen Dr. Grout

07:48.701 --> 07:49.633
writing the letters,

07:49.702 --> 07:51.363
yet he chose not to erase them.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.929
Or perhaps he felt that
the letters were gibberish.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.874
Or he wanted us to find them.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.747
Francis was more than merely
a partner.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.807
He was like a brother to me.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.284
Do you know of anyone

08:07.353 --> 08:09.446
who might have wanted
to harm him, Dr. Greyson?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.080
No, no, none at all.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.091
Staff loved him.
His subjects loved him.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.456
I can't think of anyone here

08:14.527 --> 08:17.087
who's had harsh words
with Dr. Grout.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.290
And what about
outside of the institute?

08:19.365 --> 08:20.354
Did he have family?

08:20.433 --> 08:22.424
The institute was his family.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.696
I see.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.465
Do you recall what he was doing
the last time you saw him?

08:26.539 --> 08:29.167
Yes, he was in the common room
with his subjects.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.143
Subjects?
You mean patients.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.337
This is not an asylum,
Detective.

08:34.413 --> 08:37.347
Everyone here possesses a brain
which is...

08:37.416 --> 08:39.509
what shall we say...
special.

08:39.585 --> 08:40.517
Special?

08:40.586 --> 08:44.454
Some are genius, some damaged,
and some just a mystery.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.924
We hope that this research
will one day be able to control

08:46.993 --> 08:50.895
dementia, brain fever, female
hysteria, things of this nature.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.863
Fascinating.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.924
And just how many subjects
were under Dr. Grout's care?

08:56.002 --> 08:57.196
All of them, technically.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.068
But there were three which were
of personal interest to him.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.436
I'd very much like to meet them.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.600
Yes, of course.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.305
Francis was primarily interested
in subjects

09:07.380 --> 09:11.749
who were, in one way or another,
trapped inside their own minds.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.115
That's Miss Pringle
playing the violin.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.455
Miss Pringle possesses
an extraordinary brain

09:17.523 --> 09:19.081
for a woman.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.182
For a woman?

09:20.259 --> 09:23.251
Men have a brain capacity
of up to 19% larger.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.696
Women's brains are not designed
for complex thought,

09:26.766 --> 09:28.597
their reproductive organs
sapping energy

09:28.668 --> 09:29.930
from any further development.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.469
And this has been proven?

09:31.537 --> 09:33.732
There are naysayers, of course.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.774
You know,
they said the same of Darwin.

09:35.841 --> 09:39.902
Now, the fascinating thing
about Miss Pringle's case

09:39.979 --> 09:42.641
is that two years ago
she suffered a carriage accident

09:42.715 --> 09:44.114
and when she awoke
from her coma,

09:44.183 --> 09:47.209
she did so with a heightened
sense of empathy,

09:47.286 --> 09:50.847
as if able to sense
the emotions of others.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.450
Now, Mr. Horton.

09:54.527 --> 09:58.463
Now, Mr. Horton here
is quite the opposite.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.192
He is unable to sense emotion,

10:00.266 --> 10:03.360
but he does possess
an extraordinary recall.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.405
Mr. Horton can recite
a thousand digits of pi.

10:06.472 --> 10:07.598
And when he does so,

10:07.673 --> 10:09.971
he sees each digit
as a different color.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.168
Synesthesia.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.801
Oh, you're familiar?

10:12.878 --> 10:15.278
I've read about it
in the medical journals.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.816
Dr. Galton's work
is particularly intriguing.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.443
Well, then, you should find
Mr. Horton quite fascinating.

10:20.519 --> 10:25.388
Mr. Horton,
what day was July 7, 1888?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.484
Saturday.
Sunny, high of 71 degrees.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.188
Impressive.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.787
Please.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.958
Mr. Horton,
I'm Detective Murdoch.

10:35.034 --> 10:38.026
What can you tell me about your
last meeting with Dr. Grout?

10:38.104 --> 10:40.572
We met to play chess.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.540
He wore a navy-blue jacket
with a red tie.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.007
Cigar stains on his fingers.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.567
- And did you play chess?
- He had no time.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.138
16 steps, click.
16 steps, click.

10:50.216 --> 10:53.947
He means Dr. Grout walked
16 steps as he left.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.250
The click was the latch
as the door closed behind him.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.085
With time,
one becomes accustomed

10:58.157 --> 10:59.784
to Mr. Horton's means
of communication.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.053
Detective Murdoch,

11:01.127 --> 11:03.027
Miss Katherine Barrington,
our head nurse.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.187
It's a pleasure.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.198
Did you speak with Dr. Grout
yesterday?

11:07.266 --> 11:08.426
Yes.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.662
He seemed a little distracted.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.067
But, of course,
I last saw him in the morning,

11:12.138 --> 11:13.969
which was not his finest hour.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.476
If only I'd known
what was about to happen...

11:17.543 --> 11:19.977
If you'll excuse me...

11:21.580 --> 11:24.208
Yes, Richard, what is it now?

11:24.283 --> 11:25.648
Richard Binney.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.551
The third subject
under Francis' care.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.454
A stroke left him
almost completely paralyzed

11:31.524 --> 11:32.616
and unable to speak.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.159
Although
his intellectual faculties

11:34.226 --> 11:36.091
remain completely intact.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.094
And the bell?

11:37.163 --> 11:39.324
His means of communication.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.229
He can move
only a single finger.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.098
One bell for "yes,"
two for "no. "

11:44.170 --> 11:48.038
To be quite honest,
it can grow rather tiresome.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.671
- Oh, and the gentleman with him?
- Andrew Nesbitt.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.575
Not one of Dr. Grout's subjects.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.013
Mr. Nesbitt has the ability
to see in three dimensions,

11:57.083 --> 11:58.573
like the great Da Vinci.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.551
They refer to him
as "Mr. Tinker"

12:00.619 --> 12:03.747
due to the fact that he's
perpetually repairing something.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.223
Mr. Nesbitt, Mr. Binney,

12:06.292 --> 12:07.816
I'm Detective William Murdoch,

12:07.893 --> 12:09.884
investigating the death
of Dr. Grout.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.226
I wonder if either of you
saw him yesterday.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.230
No.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.267
Mr. Binney?

12:15.334 --> 12:16.426
Richard saw nothing.

12:16.502 --> 12:20.438
I'd prefer if Mr. Binney
answered for himself, thank you.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.677
No.
Thank you both.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.213
I'll need you to confirm
the whereabouts

12:28.280 --> 12:30.874
of each of the patients
when Dr. Grout went missing.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.383
Yes, of course.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.419
Surely,
you can't seriously believe

12:34.487 --> 12:36.614
that anyone here
is capable of murder.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.954
Until proven otherwise,
everyone is a suspect, Doctor,

12:40.025 --> 12:41.925
including you.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.621
I see.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.425
Well, good day, Detective.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.466
Good day.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.867
He left in a cloud.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.874
- A cloud?
- A dark cloud.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.414
It was in his eyes.

13:03.482 --> 13:06.576
Something was troubling him.

13:06.652 --> 13:09.086
You spoke with him?

13:09.155 --> 13:12.056
I didn't have to, Detective.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.649
I could see.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.727
So, Higgins has checked

13:17.797 --> 13:20.425
every hunting and archery club
in the city,

13:20.499 --> 13:22.399
but no one can recognize
the arrows

13:22.468 --> 13:24.333
and there's no one
with the initials "W.Y."

13:24.403 --> 13:25.768
And this institute?

13:25.838 --> 13:28.636
There was a Weston Young
who interned here briefly,

13:28.707 --> 13:30.766
but he moved to England
about two years ago.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.834
We're still waiting
from Scotland Yard to confirm.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.243
Very good, George.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.441
So, Dr. Grout arranges to play
chess with one of his patients,

13:37.516 --> 13:40.349
something changes his mind,
he tells no one of his concerns,

13:40.419 --> 13:43.183
he leaves in a cloud of worry,

13:43.255 --> 13:46.053
and is found dead
the next morning.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.457
So, why did he leave?
An appointment of some sort?

13:48.527 --> 13:49.789
I searched his office.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.557
There was nothing
in his appointment book.

13:51.630 --> 13:52.790
But more interestingly,

13:52.865 --> 13:55.732
all of the "W" files were
missing from his filing cabinet.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.292
Is that right?
Who would have taken those?

13:58.370 --> 13:59.860
- The killer?
- Possibly.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.169
Or maybe the doctor himself.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.640
Perhaps the good doctor
had something...

14:03.709 --> 14:06.143
Sweet mother of...

14:06.212 --> 14:08.908
Mr. Nesbitt, did you do this?

14:08.981 --> 14:09.948
Yes.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.710
An electric wheel.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.445
That's quite a feat
of engineering.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.146
Had to be done for protection.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.654
I'm sorry.
Protection?

14:16.722 --> 14:19.020
Richard doesn't have the means
to escape like the others.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.956
What happens if he encounters
the hooded man?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.857
The hooded man?

14:22.928 --> 14:24.919
He roams the halls sometimes
at night.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.225
I've seen him.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.462
A little larger.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.167
And the cloak,
it drapes a little more.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.575
And the crossbow
is in his left hand.

14:39.645 --> 14:43.342
Yes, that's it.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.815
Thank you.
That's all for now.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.045
Yes, sir.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.890
Well, if there's nothing else,
Detective,

14:52.958 --> 14:53.890
I'll make my way.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.927
Miss Pensall, I wonder
if you can tell me more

14:55.995 --> 14:57.292
about your vision.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.024
I've already given you
an apt description.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.259
No, I mean about me.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.425
My fate.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.541
The... The dreams
are always the same.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.442
It starts with a noise.

15:19.285 --> 15:23.244
A strange, hollow screech,
and I can't place it.

15:23.322 --> 15:26.780
And then the flashes come.

15:26.859 --> 15:30.192
And an arrow slicing the air.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.422
No!

15:31.497 --> 15:34.022
A woman's scream
and you falling on your knees.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.425
Thank you, Miss Pensall.

15:37.503 --> 15:41.132
Detective, please be caref...

15:42.374 --> 15:44.501
No.
No!

15:44.576 --> 15:46.009
What is it?
Are you all right, Miss Pensall?

15:46.078 --> 15:48.911
The reaper.
He's striking again.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.055
Mr. Nesbitt was last seen in the
common room around 10:00, sir.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.654
And the body was found...

16:06.732 --> 16:09.257
About an hour ago
by janitorial staff.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.565
The doors are locked
every evening at 8:00 p.m.,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.434
suggesting that the perpetrator

16:13.505 --> 16:16.906
would have been someone
who had access to the institute.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.138
Miss Pringle.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.308
He had been so upset.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.316
What about?

16:26.385 --> 16:29.411
He'd been nattering on and on
about this hooded man.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.422
Finally,
I couldn't take it anymore,

16:31.490 --> 16:33.754
and I went back to my room
to play violin.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.453
I should never have left him
alone.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.393
Did you hear anything
last night?

16:38.464 --> 16:40.728
At one point,
I thought I heard a shout

16:40.799 --> 16:42.733
coming from the other end
of the hall.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.234
And what did you do?

16:44.303 --> 16:46.396
I went to my door and listened.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.168
But there was only silence.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.106
I assumed
I'd been imagining things.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.667
Miss Pringle, whose room
is at the end of the hall?

16:59.551 --> 17:01.610
Mr. Horton?

17:01.687 --> 17:05.748
Ah, Mr. Horton,
Detective Murdoch.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.388
I wonder, did you hear
anything unusual

17:09.461 --> 17:11.656
outside your door last night?

17:12.397 --> 17:15.060
Scream, 24, pause, boom.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.694
Scream, 24, pause, boom.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.237
24?

17:19.304 --> 17:21.897
24 hours in a day.
24 karats in a gold nugget.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.637
24 steps past my door.
24, 24.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.342
Thank you, Mr. Horton.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.881
So, the reaper
is in this hallway.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.249
He fires the arrow

17:35.320 --> 17:38.084
and runs toward the exit.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.523
Using his hand as a pivot,

17:42.594 --> 17:47.998
he jumped over the banister
and down to the floor below.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.230
George, dust this handrail
for fingermarks.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.032
Sir.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.101
What is it?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.505
Some sort of paste?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.208
I don't know.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.046
Detective?

18:06.118 --> 18:08.609
Perhaps you should see this.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.116
We found him in a closet.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.386
It's as if he was trying to
escape or something.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.621
One ring for "yes,"
two for "no," correct?

18:18.497 --> 18:20.522
That would be "yes. "

18:20.599 --> 18:22.430
Mr. Binney,
were you alone last night?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.365
Was Mr. Horton with you?

18:29.475 --> 18:30.942
Did you see who killed him?

18:32.578 --> 18:33.545
Was it a man?

18:34.746 --> 18:36.373
Was it a woman?

18:39.751 --> 18:41.446
D-D...

18:41.520 --> 18:43.511
- Has he ever done this before?
- Yes.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.920
He tries to speak when agitated,

18:44.990 --> 18:46.821
but he's not capable
of forming words.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.519
D-D...

18:50.195 --> 18:52.663
Mr. Binney...

18:52.731 --> 18:55.598
is this what you saw last night?

18:57.569 --> 19:00.037
D-D-D...

19:01.940 --> 19:03.874
Death.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.581
The Hindus have their Yamaloks.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.446
The Christians
have the four horsemen.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.849
The Egyptians
have their god Osiris.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.682
Oh, spare me the history lesson,
Murdoch.

19:15.754 --> 19:18.222
Why would the killer wear
a reaper costume?

19:18.290 --> 19:21.555
Two reasons. It conceals his
identity, and it spreads fear.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.720
But it's more than
just a simple costume, sir.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.888
He's deliberately chosen
to dress theatrically,

19:25.964 --> 19:27.488
the embodiment of death.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.329
He's trying to draw attention
to himself?

19:29.401 --> 19:30.663
I think he wants to be
remembered.

19:30.736 --> 19:33.170
And the victims, any connection
between Nesbitt and Grout?

19:33.238 --> 19:34.933
None that we've found so far.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.237
Mr. Nesbitt was never
under his care.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.537
However, Miss Pringle did say

19:38.610 --> 19:40.544
that Nesbitt was about to unmask
the reaper.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.204
And Mr. Binney did see him.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.875
Again, suggesting that the
killer was inside the institute.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.474
What I find strange

19:46.552 --> 19:50.113
is "Why did the killer spare
Mr. Binney's life? "

19:50.189 --> 19:51.713
Surely, he saw him.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.883
Couldn't bring himself to hurt
a cripple, perhaps?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.256
A reaper with a conscience.

20:10.075 --> 20:11.770
What are you doing?

20:11.843 --> 20:14.539
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm thinking.

20:14.613 --> 20:18.174
Could you possibly think
in a slightly different manner?

20:18.250 --> 20:21.117
For God sakes, Murdoch,
it works for you.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.919
Actually, it does work.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.585
We need to put someone
inside that institution,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.059
and you'd be
the bloody perfect candidate

20:30.128 --> 20:31.186
with that strange noggin
of yours.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.424
But, sir,
they already all know me.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.863
Then what about someone else?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.901
Someone that we're both familiar
with?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.436
Me, Detective?

20:38.503 --> 20:40.596
Yes, we need someone
to go undercover

20:40.672 --> 20:41.604
inside the institute.

20:41.673 --> 20:42.731
To spy?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.276
"Observe" is the term
I'd prefer to use.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.508
How delicious.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.674
Now, before you agree,
Miss Pensall,

20:51.750 --> 20:54.082
I must warn you,
there have been murders.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.086
Danger is involved.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.089
It's not me that's in danger,
Detective.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.223
Green.

21:04.296 --> 21:05.661
Triangle.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.528
No, wait.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.293
Square.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.764
Six for six.
It's remarkable.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.504
And you say you also possess
the ability

21:19.578 --> 21:22.206
to channel the afterlife?

21:22.614 --> 21:25.310
I don't know why the spirits
have chosen me.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.113
Miss Pensall, might I ask

21:27.185 --> 21:30.643
what it is that you hope
to achieve by being here?

21:30.722 --> 21:35.853
I want to understand me,
why I am the way I am.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.918
Why I'm so different
than others.

21:37.996 --> 21:41.022
And we would love to help you,
but I do have to caution you,

21:41.099 --> 21:44.728
we have experienced
a number of incidents here.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.566
I've heard.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.198
But the visions are coming
more than ever as of late,

21:49.274 --> 21:51.435
and the situation is critical.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.206
I'm willing to accept
the risks involved.

21:54.279 --> 21:58.443
Well, of course,
I can't promise you anything,

21:58.517 --> 22:00.314
but, Miss Pensall,
we would be honored

22:00.385 --> 22:03.115
to help you explore
your sixth sense.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.994
Sir, we just received a telegram
from Scotland Yard.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.623
It seems Weston Young,

22:14.700 --> 22:17.464
the only chap from the institute
with the initials "W.Y.,"

22:17.536 --> 22:18.901
is a schoolteacher
in Birmingham.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.631
And he hasn't left England,

22:20.706 --> 22:23.732
so unless he's got
one hell of a crossbow,

22:23.809 --> 22:26.676
I'm not sure where we turn next.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.906
I have an idea, George.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.788
The typeface is 8-point serif
from a standard Remington.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.755
There were no fingermarks
on the letter

22:38.824 --> 22:40.985
or a return address
on the envelope.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.549
You think the killer may have
written this letter, sir?

22:42.627 --> 22:43.559
Possibly.

22:43.628 --> 22:45.118
It may also be an anonymous tip

22:45.197 --> 22:47.688
from someone who wants us
to know about Wykeham.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.427
Why not just come forward, then?

22:49.501 --> 22:50.695
Perhaps they were frightened.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.794
If the killer did send it,
why would he do that?

22:52.871 --> 22:56.363
This letter and the "W.Y."
at Dr. Grout's murder scene

22:56.441 --> 22:58.500
would suggest someone wants us
to know about Wykeham,

22:58.577 --> 23:00.044
whoever or whatever it is.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.580
Perhaps it's just
some sort of game to him,

23:02.647 --> 23:04.046
like he enjoys riling us.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.845
Of course he's enjoying it,
but I'm not.

23:05.917 --> 23:07.214
And you lot
better not be neither.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.378
Now, find out what
the bloody hell "Wykeham" means.

23:09.454 --> 23:12.082
Mulligan, give me that.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.523
Wykeham.
Doesn't ring a bell.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.652
Perhaps in conjunction
with the Greyson Institute?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.660
No, I'm sorry.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.196
You feel that there's
a connection?

23:19.264 --> 23:21.095
Two people are dead.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.464
Both with ties to the institute.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.002
What do you really know
about it?

23:25.070 --> 23:27.937
Or Dr. Greyson or Dr. Grout,
for that matter?

23:28.006 --> 23:29.837
Well, like I said,
they're very well-respected

23:29.908 --> 23:30.840
in the medical community.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.934
- Was it always this way?
- As far as I know.

23:33.011 --> 23:34.410
But I can make some inquiries.

23:34.479 --> 23:37.915
I would very much
appreciate that.

23:37.983 --> 23:39.746
Wykeham?

23:39.818 --> 23:41.877
No, I have no idea
what that means.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.888
Whatever it is, Dr. Grout
wanted us to know about it.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.753
So much so
that he died writing it.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.191
Could it have been
a former patient,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.354
a place perhaps,
something in his childhood?

23:51.430 --> 23:54.661
Do you know what happens to the
brain of a dying man, Detective?

23:54.733 --> 23:57.964
Well, starved of oxygen,
the brain begins to shut down.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.003
Practically speaking,

23:59.070 --> 24:01.538
the mental building blocks
begin to collapse,

24:01.606 --> 24:04.302
releasing random sparks
of thought,

24:04.376 --> 24:07.743
which, in these final moments,
make sense only to God.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.008
This "W.Y." which Francis wrote

24:10.081 --> 24:13.312
very likely has nothing
to do with anything.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.580
This letter didn't come
from a dying man.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.121
It came from someone

24:17.189 --> 24:18.554
with intimate knowledge
of this murder.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.885
Furthermore, most likely,

24:19.958 --> 24:21.858
intimate knowledge
of this facility.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.394
If anything comes to mind,
Detective,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.124
you'll be informed immediately.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.432
Wykeham, Miss Pringle.

24:31.503 --> 24:32.800
Are you sure
you haven't heard of it?

24:32.871 --> 24:33.963
Never.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.906
I'd remember
something odd like that.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.102
Thank you.

24:39.177 --> 24:43.079
And if anyone else should
remember, please let me know.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.287
I don't believe we've met.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.188
Miss Pensall.
Delighted.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.557
How terribly clandestine.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.290
- How are you?
- Oh, never better.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.922
Though I don't have much
to report.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.728
This Wykeham seems to be
a bit of a dead end.

25:02.801 --> 25:04.666
It's important you gain
the trust

25:04.736 --> 25:06.328
of the residents and the staff.

25:06.404 --> 25:08.031
They must believe that you...

25:08.106 --> 25:11.132
Honestly, Detective,
I understand what I'm to do.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.769
I just think
you should be careful.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.943
As should you.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.180
No, Detective,
I've not heard of Wykeham.

25:22.254 --> 25:25.417
Though if I should,
I shall call you at once.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.424
Thank you, Miss...

25:27.492 --> 25:28.959
Pensall.

25:30.962 --> 25:33.294
Ah, how about you, Mr. Binney?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.663
Have you heard of this Wykeham?

25:37.068 --> 25:38.558
No.

25:38.637 --> 25:39.569
Nurse Barrington.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.697
I was hoping perhaps
you've heard of Wykeham.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.172
Yes, yes, Wykeham.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.004
I'm afraid not.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.169
- Are you sure?
- Quite.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.577
Is something troubling you,
Nurse Barrington?

25:49.648 --> 25:52.344
I can assure you, Detective,
I am absolutely fine.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.180
I've just had
a marvelous breakfast

25:54.252 --> 25:55.742
and it's a beautiful day and...

25:55.820 --> 25:58.186
Be careful, Richard!

25:58.256 --> 26:00.486
Are you all right?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.652
Yes, fine, fine.
No harm done.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.059
Detective...

26:05.130 --> 26:07.394
Yes?

26:07.465 --> 26:09.433
Nurse Barrington.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.264
A word, please.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.735
I must go.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.886
Ah, Miss Barrington,

26:37.963 --> 26:39.692
I take it you weren't
able to speak freely

26:39.764 --> 26:42.289
back at the institute.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.643
First a doctor,
then a patient, now a nurse.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.977
All we need now is an orderly.
We'll have the whole collection.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.346
She went to great lengths
to conceal our meeting.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.851
How on earth did the killer
find out about it?

27:01.920 --> 27:05.219
My bet is that he followed her.
Lurking in the shadows.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.384
It's what these murderous types
are good at, Murdoch.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.352
What's this?

27:11.429 --> 27:13.294
We found it in her purse.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.528
"We've buried Wykeham too long.
The time to act is now.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.694
F.G."
Francis Grout.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.931
Dated two days
before his murder.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.496
This is what
she was bringing you?

27:22.574 --> 27:23.506
So it would seem.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.873
It also suggests
that Wykeham is deceased.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.036
Dead?

27:27.112 --> 27:28.704
Now, why would that stop us?

27:29.781 --> 27:33.080
Ah, yes, why, indeed?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.588
Perhaps
you don't need me, after all.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.886
Nonsense, Inspector.

27:39.958 --> 27:43.189
I ask that you concentrate
on what we know.

27:43.261 --> 27:46.697
A young woman with a connection
to this place.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.199
Close your eyes.

27:52.437 --> 27:53.631
Breathe in.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.105
And out.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.204
Spirit in the hall,

28:03.281 --> 28:07.718
we reach out to you from this,
our welcoming den,

28:07.786 --> 28:10.380
and we ask that you join us.

28:10.455 --> 28:13.856
There is a word
that has come to us.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.621
A word you may know.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.186
Wykeham.

28:20.498 --> 28:22.591
Say it with me.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.066
Wykeham.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.103
Wykeham.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.264
- Wykeham.
- Wykeham.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.572
- Wykeham.
- Wykeham.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.271
- Wykeham.
- Wykeham.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.809
Something's coming.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.546
Can you smell that?

28:42.620 --> 28:44.645
Oh, oh.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.748
What is it?

28:46.825 --> 28:48.793
Oh, it's smoke.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.054
Oh.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.562
Oh, she's in trouble.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.098
She needs help.
Can't you hear her?

28:55.166 --> 28:56.428
Oh.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.128
Burning flesh.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.467
My God, the smell!

29:01.740 --> 29:03.071
The flames.

29:03.141 --> 29:06.907
Stop the flames.
Stop the flames.

29:16.821 --> 29:18.550
She's gone.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.191
I think I need a drink.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.596
These are the records
of every fire in the city

29:29.667 --> 29:31.191
during the last 10 years.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.499
We'll divide and conquer,
each of us taking a third.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.436
Keep your eyes peeled
for the word "Wykeham. "

29:35.507 --> 29:36.474
Uh, spelling, sir?

29:36.541 --> 29:38.907
W- y-k-e-h-a-m.

29:38.977 --> 29:39.944
Check everything.

29:40.011 --> 29:42.844
Arsonists, victims, firemen,
even the family cat.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.176
Why fires?

29:44.249 --> 29:47.013
Let's just say
the spirit moved us.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.582
Aah!

30:21.853 --> 30:22.785
Murdoch!

30:22.854 --> 30:24.014
What are you doing sleeping?

30:26.191 --> 30:27.715
Sorry.
I must have dozed off.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.350
Then, perhaps
this will perk you up.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.622
11th of April, 1893.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.664
A lodge burnt down
off Buchanan Street.

30:33.731 --> 30:36.222
It's listed in the books
as Lot 659.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.031
But back then, Buchanan Street
went by a different name.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.162
Wykeham.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.108
Did a young woman happen to die
in the fire, by chance?

30:45.176 --> 30:47.303
Sophia Chaucer, age 22.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.073
Her remains were found
in the basement,

30:49.147 --> 30:50.273
burnt beyond recognition.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.613
Well, I'll have to find out
who the owner of the lodge was.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.210
Crabtree's way ahead of you,
me old mucker.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.017
Someone
you're very familiar with.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.183
Our good friend Dr. Greyson.

31:01.259 --> 31:04.524
Oh, and try and stay awake.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.368
Detective.

31:21.446 --> 31:23.414
Miss Pensall.

31:23.481 --> 31:25.881
I've discovered
what Wykeham means.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.714
It was a lodge once leased
to Dr. Burrit Greyson.

31:28.786 --> 31:29.718
Dr. Greyson?

31:29.787 --> 31:31.652
Yes.
It burnt to the ground.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.213
And there was a young woman
trapped inside.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.223
Sophia Chaucer.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.089
Well, that must be
the young woman's spirit.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.957
- Sophia Chaucer.
- Perhaps, perhaps.

31:38.029 --> 31:38.961
But more importantly,

31:39.030 --> 31:40.395
until I've questioned
Dr. Greyson,

31:40.465 --> 31:43.229
it's no longer safe for you
to be here.

31:43.301 --> 31:44.563
Oh.

31:45.136 --> 31:48.799
Oh, I feel her, Detective.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.341
She's here.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.240
She's here.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.218
Sophia?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.960
Sophia Chaucer?

32:18.236 --> 32:20.363
She's here.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.167
I can feel her.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.504
What does she want?

32:24.575 --> 32:25.735
She says that...

32:33.718 --> 32:35.185
Detective!

33:29.307 --> 33:30.774
May I help you?

33:31.876 --> 33:33.901
Why, yes.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.343
Yes, you can.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.513
This is absurd.

33:41.586 --> 33:44.054
You can't possibly believe
any of this.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.147
You've got nothing on me!

33:46.224 --> 33:47.555
Nothing!

33:47.625 --> 33:49.889
Why, yes, in fact, you do have
something on Dr. Greyson.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.792
According to Miss Chaucer's
family doctor,

33:51.863 --> 33:53.728
she did have a connection
with him.

33:53.798 --> 33:54.787
Epilepsy.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.561
Epilepsy?

33:56.634 --> 33:57.931
She had quite a severe case.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.562
Her doctor recommended
she speak with Dr. Greyson.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.937
How does a young woman admitted
to the Greyson Institute

34:04.008 --> 34:05.908
end up burnt to death
at Wykeham Lodge?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.911
I think I may know how.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.344
- Oh?
- After our last discussion,

34:09.414 --> 34:11.279
I looked into the history
of the institute.

34:11.349 --> 34:12.281
And...

34:12.350 --> 34:14.181
You were right
to have your suspicions.

34:14.252 --> 34:15.411
How do you mean?

34:15.485 --> 34:16.475
I spoke with some colleagues

34:16.554 --> 34:18.385
who have treated former patients
of the institute.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.583
The rumors are quite disturbing.

34:21.659 --> 34:25.561
What happened to Sophia
had nothing to do with me.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.360
She had epilepsy,
you used her as a guinea pig,

34:28.433 --> 34:30.525
and whatever procedure you
performed on her didn't work,

34:30.601 --> 34:31.533
did it?

34:31.601 --> 34:34.036
All surgery is a risk,
Detective.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.437
And what I did was attempt
to give her a chance

34:36.507 --> 34:39.340
at living a life
with some degree of normalcy.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.708
Did you?

34:41.779 --> 34:44.179
Or did you, in fact, know
the procedure wouldn't work

34:44.248 --> 34:47.445
and that's why you performed it
off the premises at Wykeham?

34:47.518 --> 34:48.985
I performed it at Wykeham

34:49.053 --> 34:52.112
because this type of surgery
is years ahead of its time,

34:52.190 --> 34:55.819
and not everyone
can understand that.

34:55.893 --> 34:59.659
No, not everyone can understand
a horrific failure.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.664
A failure?

35:04.702 --> 35:08.331
Miss Chaucer's operation
shed invaluable light

35:08.406 --> 35:11.466
onto the functioning of
the occipital lobe, Detective,

35:11.542 --> 35:14.170
which will lead to breakthroughs
in the study of epilepsy.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.475
Millions will benefit from this.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.141
Yet it didn't benefit
Miss Chaucer.

35:19.217 --> 35:23.483
I made a slight miscalculation
on her frontal lobe.

35:23.554 --> 35:29.356
Do you know that
her entire memory was erased?

35:29.427 --> 35:31.486
It was truly fascinating.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.325
Fascinating?

35:33.397 --> 35:36.366
A young woman's life
was destroyed, sir.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.098
Well, you're a thinker,
Detective.

35:42.173 --> 35:43.105
Like myself.

35:43.174 --> 35:46.575
Surely, you can understand
the concept of acceptable risk.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.908
So, you feel no shame
for what you did to her?

35:48.980 --> 35:51.448
Shame? No.
Not at all.

35:51.516 --> 35:53.882
Then, why not simply tell me
about Wykeham?

35:53.951 --> 35:59.082
We were concerned regarding the
legal ramifications of the fire.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.819
That's it.
Because of the fire?

36:01.893 --> 36:05.090
What more could there be?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.423
You disgust me.

36:11.469 --> 36:14.961
Future generations will benefit
from my work, Detective.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.633
You mark my words.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.372
What makes you think

36:20.444 --> 36:21.934
that Dr. Greyson's not our man?

36:22.013 --> 36:24.675
Because he has no archery
experience whatsoever.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.114
Well, it must be easy enough
to learn.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.118
Rudimentary skills, perhaps,

36:28.186 --> 36:30.177
but these murders have displayed
an expert hand.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.381
Perhaps he's in cahoots
with someone on the outside.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.014
Then why not kill
Miss Pensall and I

36:34.091 --> 36:36.559
when the opportunity
presented itself?

36:36.627 --> 36:38.322
It's as if he wanted me
to follow him

36:38.396 --> 36:40.864
and find the conveniently hidden
reaper costume

36:40.932 --> 36:42.263
in Dr. Greyson's office.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.063
Just like he wanted you
to find out about Wykeham.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.934
Something about this does stink.
I'll give you that, Murdoch.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.997
Sir, I've been trying to track
down Miss Chaucer's family,

36:51.075 --> 36:53.009
but her mother passed away
during labor

36:53.077 --> 36:55.170
and her father died
due to complications from quinsy

36:55.246 --> 36:56.235
just a few months ago.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.611
- No other family?
- None.

36:57.682 --> 36:58.649
There is one other thing.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.650
It seems Miss Chaucer
was something of an archer.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.852
Oh?

37:20.471 --> 37:21.961
Richard, can I help you?

37:34.585 --> 37:37.281
It's all right, Richard.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.983
She's coming again.

37:40.057 --> 37:42.082
That girl from the lodge,
Sophia.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.751
I don't know what she wants.

38:02.546 --> 38:04.275
Oh, my God, it's not me
she's trying to reach.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.578
It's you.
She wants to tell you something.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.448
She says she wants you to be
the man she fell in love with.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.796
The man before Wykeham.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.902
It's you.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.738
I wish you hadn't said that.

38:34.178 --> 38:36.772
Please don't struggle,
Miss Pensall.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.486
This will be quick,
like a suicide.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.854
I don't want you to suffer.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.393
No, listen, Richard.
Sophia told me everything.

38:50.461 --> 38:51.792
How they promised
to make her better,

38:51.862 --> 38:52.886
and they took her away from you.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.625
Please, Richard, please!
No, no!

38:55.700 --> 38:57.827
I couldn't let them get away
with it,

38:57.902 --> 38:59.028
so I came up with this plan.

38:59.103 --> 39:02.004
I spent a year studying
the movements of stroke victims.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.734
Five months in that chair.

39:03.808 --> 39:06.299
I had to do it,
don't you understand?

39:06.377 --> 39:10.177
After her operation,
she didn't even know my name.

39:10.247 --> 39:13.239
No, Richard. I said
I could help you talk to her.

39:13.317 --> 39:15.251
One more time.
Don't you want to talk to her?

39:15.319 --> 39:17.514
I can help you, Richard.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.216
I can help you.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.555
I can help you.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.856
I can help you talk to her.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.420
Now, close your eyes, Richard.

39:27.498 --> 39:30.023
Good.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.399
And concentrate
on your lovely Sophia.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.064
Breathe.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.800
Breathe.

39:42.079 --> 39:45.014
Breathe.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.982
Breathe.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.994
Miss Pensall?

40:38.068 --> 40:40.298
Miss Pensall, wait!

40:40.371 --> 40:42.168
Are you all right?

40:42.239 --> 40:43.934
No! No!

40:50.848 --> 40:53.112
William. William.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.811
Oh, no, no.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.580
William.

40:56.654 --> 40:57.643
No.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.746
No! No!

40:59.824 --> 41:01.849
No!

41:06.497 --> 41:08.397
Detective!

41:08.466 --> 41:10.832
Help!
Somebody help!

41:10.901 --> 41:14.803
Detective!
Are you all right, Detective?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.699
Help!

41:22.713 --> 41:24.578
Detective.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.343
Miss Pensall.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.181
They tell me two more weeks,
and I'll be rid of this thing.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.380
Two weeks?
That's not so bad.

41:31.455 --> 41:34.686
Slightly an eternity.
But enough about me.

41:34.758 --> 41:36.885
Tell me about Prague.

41:36.961 --> 41:41.762
Ah, well, I will be admitting
myself to the institute there

41:41.832 --> 41:43.424
in a month's time.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.526
It'll be good for me.

41:45.603 --> 41:47.662
Are you sure?

41:47.738 --> 41:50.298
Ever since I was a child,
Detective,

41:50.374 --> 41:52.171
this gift has set me apart.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.473
It's my blessing and my curse.

41:54.545 --> 41:57.514
On the one hand,
I want to know more.

41:57.581 --> 41:59.515
And on the other,
I don't want to lose

41:59.583 --> 42:02.211
that which makes me special.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.447
Yes, well, it's not
the Greyson Institute,

42:04.522 --> 42:07.423
so I doubt very much they'll be
taking that away from you.

42:07.491 --> 42:08.685
That's reassuring.

42:08.759 --> 42:11.353
Miss Pensall,
may I ask you a question?

42:11.428 --> 42:13.487
Of course.

42:13.564 --> 42:16.192
You said you saw me die.

42:16.267 --> 42:19.600
Yet here I am, very much alive.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.138
Did I cheat destiny?

42:22.206 --> 42:27.803
If it was your destiny to die,
you'd not be here right now.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.938
So, it is possible, then,
to change the course of events?

42:31.015 --> 42:33.415
Anything is possible, William.

42:35.085 --> 42:38.054
Yes, those were
Dr. Ogden's sentiments exactly.

42:38.122 --> 42:42.183
Oh.
Oh, yes, Dr. Ogden.

42:42.259 --> 42:43.658
You speak often of her.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.161
Now it's my turn to ask you
a question.

42:46.230 --> 42:50.860
What is your relationship
with Dr. Ogden?

42:50.935 --> 42:53.699
We work well together.

42:53.771 --> 42:56.934
She's a brilliant pathologist.

42:57.007 --> 43:00.067
She's well-educated,
quite witty at times.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.736
And...

43:01.812 --> 43:04.337
And she's kind.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.475
Bold.

43:07.551 --> 43:08.916
Stubborn.

43:08.986 --> 43:12.251
And quite beautiful.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.654
But I'm sorry.
You were asking me something.

43:20.998 --> 43:23.660
Perhaps there is a reason
why you did not die.

43:23.734 --> 43:26.430
Detective?

43:26.503 --> 43:28.664
I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not intruding.

43:28.739 --> 43:30.832
No, no, not at all.

43:30.908 --> 43:34.776
Miss Sarah Pensall,
meet Dr. Julia Ogden.

43:34.845 --> 43:37.837
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

43:39.216 --> 43:41.912
Miss Pensall is going to be
traveling to Prague.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.317
- Traveling?
- Yes.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.287
It's wonderful there.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.722
Charles Bridge.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.418
Prague Castle.

43:49.493 --> 43:50.858
The National Museum.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.021
One could spend years
discovering the city.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.065
Well, one could.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.760
Oh.

43:57.835 --> 43:59.894
I must be off.

43:59.970 --> 44:02.461
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Dr. Ogden.

44:02.539 --> 44:04.006
Goodbye.

44:04.074 --> 44:07.874
Miss Pensall,
the pleasure was all mine.

44:08.579 --> 44:11.275
Thank you for everything.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.008
Goodbye.

44:23.761 --> 44:26.355
I didn't know
you'd spent time in Prague.

44:26.430 --> 44:29.399
Yes, some.

44:29.466 --> 44:33.266
Funny how two people can work
so closely together...

44:33.337 --> 44:35.362
And not really know anything
about one another.

44:35.439 --> 44:37.100
Exactly.

44:37.875 --> 44:40.708
You must tell me
all about Prague.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.769
Well, I had a journal
when I was there.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.815
Oh, I'd very much like
to read it.

44:45.883 --> 44:47.908
William.
Really?

44:47.985 --> 44:50.613
Yes, really.

44:51.855 --> 44:54.050
Perhaps some excerpts.
