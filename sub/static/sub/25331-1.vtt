00:23.066 --> 00:24.676
When did it start?

00:28.506 --> 00:30.484
When did anything start?

00:33.903 --> 00:36.708
Nothing can ever just go away.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.492
Not in this universe.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.799
A man lives.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.801
A man dies.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.543
He rots. He becomes dirt.

00:45.567 --> 00:49.938
He becomes trees. He
burns and becomes gas.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.898
He becomes clouds.
He becomes rain.

00:52.922 --> 00:56.380
He becomes trees.
He becomes fruit.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.493
He feeds men who die
and become dirt.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.950
It's a meaningless cycle
of birth and death.

01:01.974 --> 01:04.803
Unless you find something or
someone to give you purpose.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.132
For me, it was Cassandra.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.465
I see her for the first time.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.314
She is dressed in black.

01:17.338 --> 01:20.080
I think I can't hit on
her, this is a funeral.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.102
We go out that night for drinks.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.148
I try to kiss her,
and she turns away,

01:25.172 --> 01:26.888
telling me she promised

01:26.912 --> 01:28.890
she would never kiss
a boy who was drunk.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.154
I ask her whether she would
ever have sex with one.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.179
She says no.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.203
I don't sleep that night,
thinking about her.

01:37.227 --> 01:40.163
I try to remember how long I have
to wait before I can call her.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.014
She calls me the next day.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.691
We make love for the first time.

01:46.715 --> 01:49.911
It is awkward, and I'm so
nervous I have trouble.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.565
She says it's okay.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.001
That we will have
plenty of time.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.787
That it will get better.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.944
In five years, seven months and
eleven days, she will leave me.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.644
Everything happens for a reason.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.107
I wonder what Bill is going
to think when he sees this.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.503
That I've written my story
editor into my story.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.034
Nah.

02:47.906 --> 02:51.171
The beginning of a story is
the most important part.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.194
You write a good
beginning and...

02:55.218 --> 02:58.258
you have a chance that people will stick
with you throughout the whole thing.

02:58.282 --> 03:01.633
A... shitty beginning and...

03:06.055 --> 03:10.035
I was so desperate
for inspiration

03:10.059 --> 03:12.714
I Googled the word
"philosophy" today.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.869
There were 138 million hits.

03:17.893 --> 03:21.307
There are 6.7 billion
people in this world.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.309
That means that
theoretically, there could be

03:23.333 --> 03:25.944
a unique philosophy for
about every 50 people.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.165
You have a philosophy.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.951
- Do I?
- You wanna hear the one I made up?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.235
Jacob: What if
we're all standing

03:36.259 --> 03:38.150
on either side of a giant scale?

03:38.174 --> 03:40.761
If we're all born
with an antithesis.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.981
Someone who's our
exact opposite.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.113
Maybe not in terms of,
like, personality

03:45.137 --> 03:47.203
but in a more
metaphysical sense.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.553
But for that to work,
wouldn't it mean that

03:49.577 --> 03:53.296
half of the world
would be miserable

03:53.320 --> 03:56.037
and the other half
really, really happy?

03:56.061 --> 03:58.083
I, I knew you would say that.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.651
Now, you've gotta consider
how many people are

04:00.675 --> 04:02.392
out-of-their-fucking-minds happy

04:02.416 --> 04:04.742
and how many people
are truly miserable.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.700
It all balances out.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.833
Unless something extraordinary
happens to somebody.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.923
That's, uh...
That's rare though.

04:11.947 --> 04:15.143
Mostly it's these
little victories.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.363
Little defeats.

04:17.387 --> 04:20.714
My theory is, when
we're getting shit on,

04:20.738 --> 04:24.892
just mildly shit on or
really, really dumped on,

04:24.916 --> 04:27.179
the exact opposite is
happening to our opposite.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.767
Do you get it?

04:29.791 --> 04:31.183
I think so.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.360
What do you think?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.188
I like it.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.892
What would you do if a
genie appeared here?

04:45.981 --> 04:47.635
The way they do in stories.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.292
And you had three wishes.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.296
What would your wishes be?

04:57.340 --> 04:59.362
I don't know.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.865
Never really thought about it.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
What about you?

05:07.219 --> 05:08.830
My first wish would be...

05:11.006 --> 05:12.660
that she would just come back.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.360
And the other two?

05:21.059 --> 05:22.979
Jacob narrating: I could
feel everything I felt,

05:23.003 --> 05:24.265
but I can't change it.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.652
A ghost looking over
my own shoulder.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.679
If time is a great city, then
all the streets are one-way.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.049
Otherwise, we'd all
be heading back.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.400
Not to the beginning but
to the point in time

05:37.424 --> 05:39.358
when we made the wrong turn.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.732
The turn that
changed everything.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.353
Knock, knock?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.464
- Hey, um, what are you...
- Hi.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.771
You're, uh, here for lunch.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.972
Yeah. Oh, how do you
feel about hotdogs?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.758
Get me out of here, please.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.109
All right, I've been thinking.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.025
I want you to quit.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.787
Quit what?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.378
I want you to quit
working at JBL.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.227
Sounds good.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.731
I'm serious.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.059
Well, babe, I just...

06:28.083 --> 06:30.888
finished telling you I'm
worried about our finances,

06:30.912 --> 06:34.065
and you respond by telling
me I should quit my job.

06:34.089 --> 06:37.111
I'm not sure that's the way
to get us out of debt, lover.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.026
This isn't about that.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.965
- Oh, it's not?
- No.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.229
This job is killing you.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.295
- Babe, I'm not quitting.
- Why?

06:47.319 --> 06:49.428
I couldn't do that to you.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.039
And how is working
at this job helping?

06:52.063 --> 06:53.863
I'm sorry, you keep making
what you're making,

06:53.887 --> 06:56.411
and it'll take years
to pay everything off.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.046
You have a gift, Jacob.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.390
I don't want to see you spending
another day at this place,

07:01.414 --> 07:02.590
squandering it.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.081
We wouldn't be able to survive.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.475
We could make it work.

07:15.478 --> 07:19.763
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm
getting a second job.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.112
No.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.114
- No, no, absolutely not.
- Yeah.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.029
- No. End of conversation.
- No, wait a second.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.795
I'm getting a second job
waiting tables, okay.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.951
What kind of man would I
be if I let you do that?

07:33.975 --> 07:36.107
No, it has nothing to do
with letting me do anything.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.826
I've thought about.
I wanna do it.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.046
And it's not like you'd just
be lying around all day.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.420
You know, I would
expect a lot from you.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.902
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.056
Yeah, you would have
to write your ass off.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.406
Seriously, like, write like
you've never written before.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.278
Oh God!

07:57.302 --> 07:58.478
Hey, and when you make it...

08:00.349 --> 08:02.849
and you will make it, you
just need the energy

08:02.873 --> 08:04.808
to focus, that's it.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.462
And when you do,
then you can, uh,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.270
pay me back for all
my extra hours.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.587
I don't know if it is possible
I could love you more.

08:34.557 --> 08:37.361
There is a subway in L.A.,

08:37.385 --> 08:40.539
even though hardly
anybody knows about it.

08:40.563 --> 08:44.020
We used to ride it downtown
to watch the Lakers.

08:44.044 --> 08:46.371
There was an old
man on the train.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.112
I asked him what the
true meaning was

08:48.136 --> 08:49.964
of the word "love."

08:51.095 --> 08:53.117
He turned to me and he said...

08:53.141 --> 08:55.511
Old man: Love is when you
can jerk off to thoughts

08:55.535 --> 08:58.296
of the person you're with.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.646
But Cassandra was
more than that.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.343
She was my muse.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.476
Everything I wrote
was about her.

09:04.500 --> 09:08.373
Everything I write will always
be about her in some way.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.246
Is there anything
else I can get you?

09:13.204 --> 09:14.336
No.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.881
Okay.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.405
Jacob narrating: I'm never going
to forgive myself for this.

09:20.429 --> 09:24.017
Now I think about it, I'm
writing about myself

09:24.041 --> 09:25.477
writing about myself writing.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.437
"And in she walked."

09:39.100 --> 09:40.362
Oh, shit!

09:41.406 --> 09:42.688
Yeah.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.148
Is that...

09:47.412 --> 09:48.912
Yeah.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.740
You live in L.A.,

09:50.764 --> 09:51.610
you hear about this
happening all the time.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.418
But Cindy O'Hare.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.615
She's so famous,
other famous people

09:56.639 --> 09:57.921
are starstruck around her.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.444
Like Madonna.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.079
And... there she is.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.450
I could just walk up to her.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.955
I could tell her she
was my first love.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.587
I've seen everything
she's ever done.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.501
Even the early avant garde
stuff nobody liked,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.005
when she had that awful hairdo.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.030
I used to watch them
with the sound off

10:20.054 --> 10:21.945
and write my own dialog.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.689
I'm losing track
of where you end,

10:23.713 --> 10:25.383
where the memories of you begin.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.254
When did I ever stop
thinking about you

10:27.278 --> 10:28.540
in the present tense?

10:33.328 --> 10:35.132
Hi.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.221
I'm a huge fan. Is there
any way you could...

10:37.245 --> 10:38.485
- Oh yeah.
- Sign that for me?

10:38.509 --> 10:40.137
Yeah, yeah.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.161
What do you do in
this situation?

10:42.185 --> 10:44.425
Y-Y-You leave her alone, right?
Let her enjoy her coffee

10:44.449 --> 10:45.621
like a normal person.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.342
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.476
But what if...

10:58.788 --> 11:00.355
Hey.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.596
Hi.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.491
Do I know you?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.059
You look familiar.

11:10.844 --> 11:16.023
Funny. I was just gonna say
exactly the same thing to you.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.681
Uh, that was a joke, right?

11:23.378 --> 11:25.486
Oh, my God, that would
be so humiliating

11:25.510 --> 11:27.488
if you were being serious.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.622
- Of course it was a joke.
- Oh! Whew!

11:30.646 --> 11:32.779
Do I look like I
live under a rock?

11:34.563 --> 11:36.217
Eh, it's hard to say.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.198
How can I help you?

11:41.222 --> 11:43.330
I, um...

11:43.354 --> 11:48.292
- I read in a magazine once...
- Uh-huh.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.231
You were doing this
interview, and...

11:52.624 --> 11:57.388
you said, "I just
want a normal guy."

11:57.412 --> 12:00.565
"I'm sick of all these
Hollywood types.

12:00.589 --> 12:04.351
"It's tough because of who I am,
people are intimidated by me.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.179
It's hard for me
to find a date."

12:06.203 --> 12:07.615
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.530
Now even though you
are this uber-famous,

12:09.554 --> 12:12.732
uber-hot actress, you
have trouble meeting men.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.126
I am so mortified right now.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.086
Well...

12:21.436 --> 12:24.458
were you bullshitting or what?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.243
Were you for real?

12:26.267 --> 12:28.748
Or just trying to sound
cool and down-to-earth?

12:31.446 --> 12:32.752
I was serious.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.626
Well...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.455
my name is Jacob Silver.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.807
Too mundane.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.528
Hey.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.792
What if I focused all my
intensity into one word?

12:52.816 --> 12:56.099
What if I funneled all my
passion into a single phrase?

12:56.123 --> 12:58.275
What if I summoned
every ounce of energy

12:58.299 --> 13:01.278
into my soul and just
overwhelmed her with my being?

13:01.302 --> 13:02.303
Hi.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.118
Too weird. Too subtle.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.555
People don't like
subtle these days.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.798
They need something big.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.254
So I wanted to tell you

13:21.278 --> 13:23.213
- I'm a really big fan of yours.
- Oh.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.606
I really respect
you as an actress.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.826
Not that my opinion means
much to you probably,

13:27.850 --> 13:31.438
but you inspire me as an artist.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.092
- Oh, my God.
- Holy shit.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.312
Hey, if you're smart, you
should open the register.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.270
Nobody move!

13:37.294 --> 13:39.490
I just want the cash
in the register,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.231
and I want wallets on the table.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.815
If y'all cooperate,

13:42.839 --> 13:44.321
I'll be gone.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.781
You'll be back
enjoying your coffee.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.305
Nobody...

13:49.350 --> 13:50.873
Holy shit.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.461
Cindy O'Hare.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.125
- No bodyguards?
- Please, please, please!

13:56.149 --> 13:57.203
- Please.
- Stand up.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.118
Okay. All right. Here.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.164
- You can take my purse...
- What the fuck do I need a purse for?

14:01.188 --> 14:02.708
Do I look like a guy
who needs a purse?

14:02.732 --> 14:04.471
Please just take my money.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.125
What do you do in
this situation?

14:06.149 --> 14:08.040
What kind of world is
it when a man like this

14:08.064 --> 14:09.128
- would hurt a girl like her?
- Please don't hurt me...

14:09.152 --> 14:10.632
No, I think you're
gonna come with me.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.923
Somebody call an ambulance.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.534
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.494
I don't think so.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.390
You saved my life.

14:31.566 --> 14:34.414
And you ruined mine...

14:34.438 --> 14:36.571
so it goes.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.680
Oh, my God. Somebody help!

14:46.624 --> 14:48.037
- You saved my life.
- No.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.213
No, no, no, a-anybody
would have done it.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.868
I-I was just closest. I...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.937
No, that was the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.223
You really want to thank me?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.877
Huh?

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
Kiss me.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.055
What?

15:06.079 --> 15:08.231
If I live, then at least
I get to tell everyone

15:08.255 --> 15:10.886
I got to kiss Cindy O'Hare.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.410
And all I had to do was
get shot in the gut.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.933
Oh.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.370
If I die...

15:17.394 --> 15:19.720
then at least let the
last thing I feel be

15:19.744 --> 15:22.617
a beautiful woman's
lips touching mine.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.763
Too ridiculous.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.005
No, the best thing is realism.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.745
Even if people don't like it,

15:44.769 --> 15:46.467
they can't fault
it if it's real.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.925
I am alive at every
moment I ever was

15:49.949 --> 15:51.839
and ever will be.

15:51.863 --> 15:55.931
Everything in my life is
happening now, somehow.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.933
Somewhere.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.327
She is still here somehow.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.396
Somewhere.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.989
We are still together somehow
in some different when.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.645
I wonder if that other me,
the one who still has her,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.777
is aware of this other me,

16:16.801 --> 16:18.692
who is alone,

16:18.716 --> 16:20.805
the way I am aware of him.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.960
Everyone I have ever known,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.657
even the people I've forgotten,

16:26.681 --> 16:28.572
are still here with
me, somewhere.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.010
Imperfect souls,
depending on how I feel.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.839
A king one day, a
beggar the next.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.082
The beauty of fiction.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.031
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.730
They say there isn't anything
more powerful than nostalgia.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.819
That you will always
remember the good times.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.908
How's it going?

17:00.932 --> 17:03.346
That you will always fall
into that human trap

17:03.370 --> 17:05.087
of wanting to be elsewhere...

17:05.111 --> 17:07.698
of failing to appreciate
where you are now,

17:07.722 --> 17:08.896
until you're gone.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.856
Those were the good times.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.603
Congratulations, Jacob.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.105
This is a big deal.

17:23.128 --> 17:26.088
Cass, I just got out of the
publisher's, the meeting, and, uh...

17:27.568 --> 17:29.720
Well, I know you're
working right now, but...

17:29.744 --> 17:32.027
It's easy to get lost in it.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.552
Writing books, talking to
agents, talking to publishers.

17:35.576 --> 17:38.424
Getting rejected
again and again.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.036
Revising. Editing. Outlining.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.126
When the words you are writing
are what are gonna pay the rent,

17:44.150 --> 17:46.824
when the little black letters
on a white screen are

17:46.848 --> 17:49.696
what are feeding your
family, you won't fail.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.159
You can't fail. It's your
most basic instinct.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.684
It's gonna be okay.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.433
What's this?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.065
I have something to show you.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.177
Okay.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.049
What do you wanna show me?

18:17.748 --> 18:20.534
Holy crap.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.493
That's so funny.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.106
Those were my exact
words when I saw it.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.612
You wanna celebrate?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.551
Yeah.

18:45.606 --> 18:47.966
- No, I've changed my mind.
- Cassandra: Oh, come on!

18:47.990 --> 18:50.453
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, it's too late. It's too late.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.629
Oh God!

18:52.653 --> 18:54.718
I'm so embarrassed.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.546
They said there was no one here.

18:56.570 --> 19:00.463
Come on. All right,
just do what I do.

19:00.487 --> 19:04.534
Yeah, well, I, I can't
do what you do.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.997
- All right.
- Okay.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.520
Here, warm it up.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.894
Feel the music.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.245
Wow.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.032
Wow.

19:25.816 --> 19:26.861
Not so bad.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.870
Tell me when it's all over.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.219
- Right here.
- Okay.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.984
Now you can look...

20:04.899 --> 20:06.659
What's this?

20:06.683 --> 20:08.792
No. No, no.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.315
It's our car.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.664
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.560
Get it.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.148
What?

20:17.172 --> 20:19.759
Does this work?

20:19.783 --> 20:22.936
The most basic instinct
of humans is to survive.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.050
Not in a tooth-and-nail way,
but in a broader sense.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.596
To be wealthy. To be safe.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.904
To be fat and happy.
To bear children.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.907
To ensure their loved
ones are looked after.

20:36.931 --> 20:40.084
We do every manner of
work to try to gain this.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.589
We sell stories.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.229
Hi.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.167
My, uh, my vehicle broke down.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.271
I don't suppose you could
give me a ride to Palmdale?

21:23.238 --> 21:26.173
Uh, what's wrong with your car?

21:26.197 --> 21:27.373
I don't know much about cars.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.962
Uh, I could give you a ride
to the callbox, if you want.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.704
Hey, what's the
matter, sweetheart?

21:34.728 --> 21:36.967
What, you, uh, you scared I
might be some ax-murderer?

21:36.991 --> 21:38.098
Pfft.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.796
No, no, of course not.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.996
I promise not to bite.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.935
Hey, you can, uh, you can search
me for weapons, if you want to.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.764
No. No, no, it's fine.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.636
Of course it's fine! Uh, get in.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.768
All right, thank you.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.857
Uh, I'm headed up to
Lancaster anyway.

21:57.881 --> 21:58.969
All right. Beautiful.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.190
My name's Chelsea.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.323
Jacob.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.347
So many of them, huh?

22:09.371 --> 22:10.938
Oh, yeah.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.203
I was just thinking
the same thing.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.380
Oh yeah?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.404
What is it?

22:22.428 --> 22:23.690
It's nothing.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.694
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.220
What, so we're just
done talking then?

22:34.309 --> 22:35.397
I was, uh...

22:36.790 --> 22:38.202
I was gonna tell you something,

22:38.226 --> 22:41.055
but now I think it's too weird.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.405
I don't know...

22:45.494 --> 22:47.061
I like weird.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.909
Well, I, uh...

22:49.933 --> 22:51.911
Before I picked you up,
I was lying in my car.

22:51.923 --> 22:53.913
Uh-huh.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.742
I was just staring
up at the stars.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.223
And this one star,
it caught my eye.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.877
What part of the sky was it in?

23:00.901 --> 23:03.880
I... Uh... It all kinda
looks the same to me.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.296
- I...
- Yeah.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.887
God. I-I can't tell you this.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.086
You're...

23:13.740 --> 23:15.370
gonna think that I'm crazy.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.308
Please, I like this story.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.312
I promise not to
interrupt again, okay?

23:25.273 --> 23:26.274
Well, um...

23:28.363 --> 23:31.366
there was something
about this star.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.413
I felt like it was important.

23:36.284 --> 23:40.264
Something that was this flash of light.
And then it was gone!

23:40.288 --> 23:44.094
And then, there was
this really loud sound,

23:44.118 --> 23:49.471
like, uh, a bunch of voices all
screaming at the same time.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.932
Now you definitely
think I'm crazy.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.785
You want me to, like, let
you out or something?

24:00.264 --> 24:02.832
No. No, I don't think
you're crazy at all.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.141
Jesus!

24:17.804 --> 24:19.869
It's time to die.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.242
What the fuck?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.308
What is... What is this?

24:24.332 --> 24:27.485
You-You can take
whatever you want.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.966
There-There's cash in my wallet.
You want...

24:29.990 --> 24:32.142
- You want my car? It's a nice car.
- No.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.840
God, this is always much harder
on unenlightened worlds.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.451
What?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.409
Maybe I'm just getting
softer with age, you know.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.480
A thousand years on the
job becomes such a grind.

24:43.307 --> 24:47.984
All right, you are going to
die, little Earthman Jacob,

24:48.008 --> 24:50.900
because you saw something you
weren't supposed to see.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.579
Wha... What?

24:55.015 --> 24:56.886
The end of Aurora.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.476
- Aur-Aur-Aurora?
- Yes.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.391
Oh, don't play dumb. You just
told me the entire story.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.828
What?

25:05.852 --> 25:08.395
- The disappearing star...
- That was nothing.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.397
That was my imagination.
It was a dream.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.921
This is... This
is still a dream.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.052
This is still a dream.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.213
This is real.

25:21.563 --> 25:24.194
Who... Who are you?

25:24.218 --> 25:28.546
I work for an organization that
watches from behind the stars.

25:28.570 --> 25:32.245
And you... were looking up
at the wrong part of the sky

25:32.269 --> 25:33.682
at the wrong time.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.858
Whatever this is,
whatever this really is,

25:35.882 --> 25:38.208
you do not have to kill me.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.254
Whatever you think I
saw, it doesn't matter.

25:41.278 --> 25:44.040
Nobody will believe me.
Nobody will care.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.651
Believe me, this is
not my idea of fun.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.567
Coming out here in the middle
of nowhere, short notice.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.309
Got a fucking thousand
other things to do.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.377
Please don't.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.469
I have a f...

26:00.907 --> 26:02.256
A what?

26:06.042 --> 26:07.130
Girl.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.183
Maybe you should
close your eyes.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.099
No.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.929
If I die, then...

26:25.105 --> 26:28.301
at least let the last thing
I see be a beautiful girl.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.286
Don't do that.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.595
There's nothing I
can do, is there?

26:39.728 --> 26:42.078
Nothing I can say to stop you.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.650
Goodbye, lover.

26:50.434 --> 26:53.326
Maybe we'll meet
again someday...

26:53.350 --> 26:54.700
you know.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.268
Nothing ever goes
away, after all.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.142
Hey, maybe we'll
be trees together.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.122
In our forest.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.986
Do you remember our forest?

27:26.122 --> 27:27.167
Hey.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.475
What are you doing?

27:32.476 --> 27:33.652
I'm reading.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.656
What are you, uh...

27:39.440 --> 27:40.659
It's...

27:44.706 --> 27:46.118
Beautiful.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.318
That's what she was gonna say.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.477
Sweetheart, you know I
don't like surprises.

27:53.501 --> 27:56.085
Yeah, well, I, uh...

27:56.109 --> 27:58.087
I think you're gonna
like this one.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.373
I gotta get back to work.

28:01.201 --> 28:05.031
Babe, we are almost there.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.778
What are we doing here?

28:16.477 --> 28:18.194
See that house?

28:18.218 --> 28:19.698
Yeah, it's our dream house.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.478
- We always said that...
- When we were rich, right?

28:25.225 --> 28:26.226
Yeah.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.271
Well...

28:31.231 --> 28:33.407
- What?
- It's our house now.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.518
- What?
- Yeah.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.414
- Come on.
- No. Seriously?

28:46.246 --> 28:48.596
Are you serious? Are
you fucking serious?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.381
Oh, it's so pretty.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.667
Come on.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.931
Every moment that has ever been

28:57.955 --> 28:59.191
still exists somehow.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.627
Somewhere.

29:00.651 --> 29:03.369
I am there in that moment.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.154
I am still there,

29:05.178 --> 29:07.373
lying in that quiet, empty house

29:07.397 --> 29:09.724
before we had our
bed shipped in.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.552
I can still feel the hardwood
floors pressing against my back

29:12.576 --> 29:14.380
through the sleeping bag.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.208
I can still smell the fragrance

29:16.232 --> 29:19.081
from that herbal shampoo
she used to use.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.866
Nothing in the universe
can ever go away.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.521
Never pull a true vanishing act.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.566
But what about thought?

29:26.590 --> 29:30.333
Can you ever truly erase
something from your memories?

29:32.509 --> 29:34.313
My flight...

29:34.337 --> 29:36.054
Oh, shit!

29:36.078 --> 29:38.187
- Hey!
- Sorry, there was so much traffic.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.624
- So glad I didn't miss you.
- I know, me too.

29:40.648 --> 29:43.453
Are you so excited? New York
City, I can't believe it.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.542
Yeah, I just can't believe
how last-minute this is.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.805
Yeah, but you're going to be on TV.
So who cares.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.241
Yeah, I know, but I promised

29:49.265 --> 29:50.634
I was gonna be
around this weekend.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.288
- We...
- I know, I know, but hey,

29:52.312 --> 29:54.152
this is what you've been
working towards, okay.

29:54.176 --> 29:55.552
This is... huge.

29:55.576 --> 29:58.424
I can hardly believe it myself.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.687
Look, I gotta go,
but I'll, uh...

30:00.711 --> 30:03.647
- I love you so much.
- Um... Yeah.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.606
I promise I'm going
to marry you someday.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.391
Okay. You promise?

30:08.415 --> 30:09.784
- Yeah. Promise.
- All right.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.307
Bye.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.375
Bye.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.611
Every moment that has ever been

30:22.635 --> 30:24.842
still exists somehow.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.539
Somewhere.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.696
I am there in that
moment with myself.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.937
Come on, girl, let's
get some work done.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.356
Let's see what you got.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.711
Hey, uh, hey, Ralph.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.409
Oh, hey, Jake.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.519
Who's that?

30:49.543 --> 30:51.937
Oh, that's Warrior right there.
That's Warrior.

30:53.982 --> 30:57.875
Ah. How's, uh, how's things?

30:57.899 --> 31:00.206
It's good, you know. It's good.
I think things are...

31:01.729 --> 31:03.533
- Things are good.
- Yeah, how is, uh...

31:03.557 --> 31:04.775
think it was, um...

31:05.907 --> 31:07.474
Sherry. Name's Sherry.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.009
She's not around
anymore, you know.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.348
Oh.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.979
Anyone new?

31:15.003 --> 31:17.083
What, your next book's gonna
be my fucking biography?

31:18.615 --> 31:20.332
Kidding, man. You
know, it's like,

31:20.356 --> 31:22.508
ask me next week, or...

31:22.532 --> 31:24.492
next day, I'm sure there'll
be somebody, you know.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.773
Pretty sure.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.993
Hey, I-I-I've been
meaning to ask, um...

31:29.017 --> 31:30.299
w-w-what's up with all the dogs?

31:30.323 --> 31:31.454
What about them?

31:33.065 --> 31:35.025
It seems like you have a
different dog every week.

31:35.049 --> 31:36.181
Yeah?

31:38.984 --> 31:40.420
Cassandra and I, we were...

31:42.944 --> 31:44.748
Well, um...

31:44.772 --> 31:48.273
we were, uh, were
swapping theories,

31:48.297 --> 31:49.840
and she thinks you, uh,

31:49.864 --> 31:51.537
you tire of them, you have...

31:51.561 --> 31:53.761
You trade them in, you got
some sort of thing worked out

31:53.785 --> 31:55.150
with the local shelter or...

31:55.174 --> 31:56.740
That's the best you
guys come up with?

31:57.741 --> 31:59.589
I'm a fucking dog-walker, man.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.286
I walk dogs for rich
people, you know.

32:01.310 --> 32:02.897
Nice to them when
they're out of town,

32:02.921 --> 32:04.724
let them take shits.
It's a good...

32:04.748 --> 32:06.446
It's a good job, you know.
I like it.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.643
Well, so that's it, huh?

32:10.667 --> 32:12.950
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.323
Sorry to disappoint.

32:15.411 --> 32:16.867
How's, uh...

32:16.891 --> 32:18.390
how's Cassandra? Is she good?

32:18.414 --> 32:20.503
- She's good. She's good.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

32:22.723 --> 32:23.724
Well...

32:24.725 --> 32:26.572
uh, she's all right.

32:26.596 --> 32:29.358
I don't like the sound
of that, buddy.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.950
No, no, no. She's, uh...
she's good. Yeah.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.712
I think she's miserable though.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.844
- She doesn't seem miserable to me.
- No.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.044
I think she hides it.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.004
Well, you would know. I mean...

32:45.050 --> 32:46.723
You think I would?

32:46.747 --> 32:47.791
Yeah.

32:49.576 --> 32:50.620
It's just...

32:52.318 --> 32:55.016
I-I-I don't think
this is her scene.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.865
This city...

32:58.889 --> 32:59.934
living in L.A.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.913
This world I'm in, writing.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.394
Agents and publishers
and press...

33:05.418 --> 33:07.986
Look, buddy, seems to me
like you don't deserve her.

33:09.683 --> 33:10.771
You think so?

33:13.473 --> 33:15.993
No. I just think you want your
cake and be able to fuck it, too.

33:16.017 --> 33:17.937
I mean, as the saying goes,
that's what you want.

33:17.961 --> 33:19.843
No, I-I feel I am big enough.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.947
- I feel like it's...
- Doesn't matter what you feel.

33:26.569 --> 33:27.720
Maybe you're right.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.963
Of course I'm fucking right.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.508
Now, can we get on?

33:32.532 --> 33:34.664
Warrior got to take a
shit somewhere, you know.

33:36.492 --> 33:39.452
Yeah, yeah. See you...
See you later, man.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.749
Jacob narrating: In the
alternate universe,

33:49.773 --> 33:51.053
the one I know exists somewhere,

33:51.077 --> 33:52.992
I am not bound by my identity.

33:54.075 --> 33:57.402
Not limited by the
choices I've made.

33:57.426 --> 34:00.623
I can be any one of those
people I knew or didn't know.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.887
Take all of their best
qualities, none of their worst.

34:07.915 --> 34:11.373
I could be Ralph.
Ralph's so cool.

34:11.397 --> 34:14.052
She always liked Ralph.
She thought he was cute.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.147
Come here.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.085
Oh, boy.

35:10.673 --> 35:11.805
Warrior!

35:12.849 --> 35:14.460
Warrior! Come here please!

35:15.461 --> 35:16.766
Warrior!

35:17.811 --> 35:19.117
Mom!

35:20.205 --> 35:21.660
Don't worry.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.121
Just hope that they
can afford it.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.495
My goodness!

35:55.196 --> 35:56.719
I think I have.

35:58.982 --> 36:02.223
Oh, uh, yes, yes, ma'am.
M-My name is Ralph.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.963
I, uh...

36:03.987 --> 36:07.097
Well, I think I found your dog.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.721
What, they found Warrior?

36:15.564 --> 36:16.696
Okay, come on.

36:18.698 --> 36:19.786
That's it.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.814
Surprise!

36:28.838 --> 36:31.034
- Go on!
- Hi, baby!

36:31.058 --> 36:32.905
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:32.929 --> 36:35.212
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.629
- Thank you.
- Uh...

36:39.240 --> 36:41.087
Hey, hey.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.191
No, whether you want it or
not, I'm giving it to you.

36:43.215 --> 36:44.743
Family.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.659
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.008
Thank you.

36:49.032 --> 36:50.643
Okay, bye.

36:58.219 --> 37:00.739
There is nothing in the
universe worth anything

37:00.763 --> 37:02.283
except a mystery.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.894
And nothing is ever as
enticing once you know it.

37:04.918 --> 37:08.637
You cannot ever truly enjoy
a story you yourself wrote.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.751
It's the uncertainty of life
that makes it compelling.

37:14.101 --> 37:17.646
It's, it's exciting. You
have to get this publicist.

37:17.670 --> 37:18.974
- They're quite expensive, but I

37:18.986 --> 37:20.301
- think it's worth it.
- Hello.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.781
- Oh, hey. Have you met...
- Sorry to interrupt.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.306
Hi.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.916
Yes.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.575
You know, it's really...

37:33.599 --> 37:35.620
The one that you,
that you meant...

37:35.644 --> 37:38.319
I-I would like to expand
this conversation.

37:38.343 --> 37:41.084
- Um...
- Yes.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.214
Okay, I got... I gotta go.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.085
All right, bye.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.130
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.349
Who-Who's that?

38:08.373 --> 38:09.983
Uh, it was n-nobody.

38:11.637 --> 38:12.986
Come... Come join us.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.165
Thank you.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.932
If only I can be him.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.262
The man called nobody.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.321
Hi.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.370
You okay?

38:51.677 --> 38:52.852
Huh.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.028
Yeah.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.291
Wonderful.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.297
Is there any way I can help?

39:06.039 --> 39:07.214
Hmm?

39:27.887 --> 39:29.062
What?

39:33.153 --> 39:34.372
Hmm?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.161
Got it.

39:42.162 --> 39:43.337
Got what?

40:02.225 --> 40:04.097
Nobody is always someone.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.771
I'm in that other universe,

40:06.795 --> 40:09.426
where reality and fiction blend.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.845
I become him, and he is me.

40:30.863 --> 40:31.951
Hey!

40:36.564 --> 40:37.826
Hey, man.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.226
Come over here when
you got a minute.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.964
Got something I
wanna chat about.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.341
Did I mention I'm
fucking Ralph's wife.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.170
I think somebody's
fucking my wife.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.824
What? Uh...

40:59.848 --> 41:00.912
What makes you think that?

41:00.936 --> 41:03.480
Intuition, I guess.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.917
Sixth sense maybe,
even a seventh.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.919
- Seems pretty reliable.
- It is.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.878
When you're that fucking
close to somebody,

41:09.902 --> 41:12.358
there's nothing you
can hide, you know.

41:12.382 --> 41:14.970
I mean, the smile is a little bit
different, you know, the way they exhale,

41:14.994 --> 41:16.754
and you just know there's something fucking
going on. You just fucking know it.

41:16.778 --> 41:19.496
So she, she breathes wrong, and
you think she's cheating on you.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.043
Maybe she's got allergies.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.004
Like I said, man, I know.

41:27.010 --> 41:28.810
Never been surer of
anything in my whole life.

41:28.834 --> 41:31.160
Theoretically, I mean,
if you're right,

41:31.184 --> 41:33.186
if, then, uh, well...

41:34.840 --> 41:37.819
Who do you think it is?
This-this guy or girl,

41:37.843 --> 41:39.148
I guess.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.348
I honestly have no idea.

41:45.372 --> 41:48.177
- How long do you think it's been going on?
- Six months.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.353
Maybe longer. Six months at least.
Yeah.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.833
Six months.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.946
Well, if you're
right, then, uh...

41:56.035 --> 41:57.079
Shit, I'm...

41:58.080 --> 41:59.362
I'm really sorry, man.

41:59.386 --> 42:00.786
No, no. I mean, it's
not your fault,

42:00.810 --> 42:01.973
you know, I mean...

42:01.997 --> 42:04.193
you didn't do anything.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.857
But I need to ask you
something, you know.

42:05.881 --> 42:07.805
I need to ask you a favor.

42:07.829 --> 42:09.285
You're gonna think it's fucking
weird, you know? But that's okay.

42:09.309 --> 42:10.895
Just... just... I
need you to do this.

42:10.919 --> 42:12.799
- Hey, sure. Sure. What do you need?
- You know?

42:15.054 --> 42:16.577
I need you to spy on her for me.

42:19.449 --> 42:20.818
What?

42:20.842 --> 42:23.038
Okay, you don't have
to do it, you know.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.213
I know it's fucking weird. You
know, just forget I even asked.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.432
You know, it's not a big deal.

42:26.456 --> 42:28.936
Just forget I even asked. It's not a...
It's nothing, you know.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.829
I'll pay you, man.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.570
I'll give you $1000.
I'll give you a grand.

42:33.594 --> 42:34.571
Even if you don't get anything.
Just for trying.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.138
I'll pay you for trying.

42:36.162 --> 42:37.356
And what if she's not?

42:37.380 --> 42:39.097
Not what?

42:39.121 --> 42:41.273
- Cheating.
- She is.

42:41.297 --> 42:43.362
Okay, but look, look, look.

42:43.386 --> 42:47.192
I'm not wrong. But if there's a
possibility that I'm wrong...

42:47.216 --> 42:48.435
and she's not, well then...

42:50.437 --> 42:52.589
at least I'd know, you know.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.613
But I gotta tell you, if I
find out she's cheating,

42:54.637 --> 42:56.037
it would rip my heart
out, you know.

42:56.061 --> 42:57.681
It would devastate me.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.117
But at least then
I'd have answers.

42:59.141 --> 43:01.511
It's not knowing
that just really...

43:01.535 --> 43:03.078
It's like an act, you know.

43:03.102 --> 43:04.622
I hate not being able
to act, you know.

43:04.646 --> 43:06.605
Just rip my fucking insides out.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.066
So what do you say?

43:14.287 --> 43:15.505
Neighbor?

43:22.121 --> 43:24.142
- Why don't you just do it?
- I can't do it.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.014
She'll recognize my car.

43:26.038 --> 43:27.537
But you're perfect.

43:27.561 --> 43:29.361
She's never going to
assume anything with you.

43:29.385 --> 43:31.367
I'll arrange everything.
I'll plan it all.

43:31.391 --> 43:33.021
Okay? And I'll pay
you in advance, man.

43:33.045 --> 43:34.500
I got cash in the house. I
can go get cash right now.

43:34.524 --> 43:36.372
What if she notices
me following her?

43:36.396 --> 43:37.956
She's not going to
notice you following.

43:37.980 --> 43:39.244
Carli's a shit driver, man.

43:39.268 --> 43:40.637
She's not gonna
check her mirrors.

43:40.661 --> 43:41.967
You're gonna be fine.

43:49.975 --> 43:51.866
I'll do it. Yeah, I'll do it.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.519
- I always wanted to be a spy.
- That's good, that's good.

43:53.543 --> 43:55.023
That's good. I like that.
That's good.

43:55.047 --> 43:56.479
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah. When?

43:56.503 --> 43:57.983
- When do you want me to do it?
- Now.

43:58.007 --> 43:58.723
- You need to do this now.
- Now?

43:58.747 --> 44:00.352
Yeah. Go.

44:00.376 --> 44:01.816
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.138
He wants you to spy on me?

44:03.162 --> 44:07.011
You know, he's convinced
you're cheating on him.

44:07.035 --> 44:08.080
Hmm.

44:09.168 --> 44:10.343
What did you say?

44:11.518 --> 44:13.191
Huh?

44:13.215 --> 44:14.564
I said I'd do it.

44:16.610 --> 44:17.631
You wh...

44:17.655 --> 44:19.178
You what?

44:20.570 --> 44:22.723
Yeah, I have a plan.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.052
Oh God.

44:25.097 --> 44:26.988
You and your ideas.

44:27.012 --> 44:30.382
You-You don't understand, Carli.
He really loves you. He...

44:30.406 --> 44:32.994
You didn't have to see his
face when he was telling me.

44:33.018 --> 44:35.170
He looked like he was dying.

44:35.194 --> 44:36.594
I'm afraid if he
found out about us,

44:36.618 --> 44:38.042
he'll do something drastic.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.372
I don't know, divorce you or...

44:40.416 --> 44:41.959
try to hurt you or something.

44:41.983 --> 44:44.353
Or hurt himself. Put
a gun in his mouth.

44:44.377 --> 44:45.897
I can't be part of
something like that.

44:47.510 --> 44:49.034
No, he's not like that.

44:51.427 --> 44:52.622
Hmm.

44:52.646 --> 44:53.778
Well...

44:56.824 --> 44:59.324
This is what I think
we're gonna do.

44:59.348 --> 45:01.022
- What?
- I'm gonna spy on you.

45:01.046 --> 45:02.676
Oh, my God.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.679
Like he wants me to. Only,
you won't go into, like...

45:05.703 --> 45:07.202
a guy's house or anything.

45:07.226 --> 45:08.986
You'll go somewhere else.
You'll go somewhere

45:09.010 --> 45:12.163
that if he saw you going,
it wouldn't hurt him,

45:12.187 --> 45:14.307
but which you'd still want to hide.
I don't know, a...

45:15.277 --> 45:17.584
a casino or something or...

45:20.761 --> 45:24.132
maybe even buy some drugs.
See...

45:24.156 --> 45:26.437
I don't think he necessarily
knows you're cheating on him.

45:26.461 --> 45:28.261
I think he just knows
you're hiding something.

45:28.285 --> 45:30.399
I think... I think
we could set it up,

45:30.423 --> 45:32.749
make it seem bad enough,
like you're scoring

45:32.773 --> 45:35.056
crack or something.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.080
'Cause even that wouldn't
hurt him the way it would

45:37.104 --> 45:39.064
- if he found out you were cheating on him.
- Hmm.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.150
He'd understand,
you know, he'd...

45:44.089 --> 45:46.178
He'd help you work it out.

45:48.702 --> 45:50.748
Mmm, I-I don't know.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.293
It's a perfect plan.

45:58.407 --> 46:01.125
I don't know if that's the word
I would use to describe it.

46:01.149 --> 46:02.803
No. I've got it all worked out.

46:05.153 --> 46:06.502
Yeah, I can see that.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.570
Hey, let me ask you
something, huh?

46:11.594 --> 46:12.615
Mmm.

46:12.639 --> 46:14.269
Okay.

46:14.293 --> 46:16.251
Let's say...

46:17.383 --> 46:19.796
your perfect plan works, huh?

46:19.820 --> 46:21.866
Let's say we go through with it.

46:24.303 --> 46:25.478
Well, what then?

46:28.263 --> 46:29.438
What do you mean?

46:30.831 --> 46:32.572
I mean, are we done then?

46:33.660 --> 46:34.704
You and I?

46:38.143 --> 46:39.797
Wouldn't you want us to be?

46:42.669 --> 46:44.149
No.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.544
No, I'd rather just
tell him the truth.

46:51.417 --> 46:52.810
I would leave him.

46:55.508 --> 46:56.814
Don't say that.

47:00.948 --> 47:02.515
All right. Well, it's true.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.481
What happened with you two?

47:16.834 --> 47:18.357
I don't know, we're
just different.

47:19.706 --> 47:21.771
We want different
things, you know.

47:21.795 --> 47:24.252
He was already in love
before we got together.

47:24.276 --> 47:25.407
What?

47:28.367 --> 47:30.282
I'm not his first love, right.

47:31.892 --> 47:34.199
- Or, or his greatest.
- I'm sure you are.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.768
Some people were put on
this planet for a reason.

47:40.292 --> 47:41.965
Some people have a purpose

47:41.989 --> 47:44.687
and if they get distracted
from that purpose...

47:46.733 --> 47:48.300
there's nothing sadder.

47:50.519 --> 47:53.542
Right? Seeing someone
old and gray just...

47:53.566 --> 47:55.960
wishing that they had done what
they were passionate about.

47:57.222 --> 47:58.223
And...

47:59.485 --> 48:01.226
I'm not his purpose.

48:02.705 --> 48:04.882
He wasn't put on this
planet to love me.

48:06.448 --> 48:08.233
And yeah, I love him, and I...

48:10.757 --> 48:12.411
I wanna stay.

48:13.847 --> 48:16.608
But...

48:16.632 --> 48:19.742
there are things he has to do.
There are things that he is...

48:19.766 --> 48:21.594
fucking good at doing.

48:24.031 --> 48:25.903
And I worry that if
I stay, he won't.

48:39.394 --> 48:40.918
Oh.

48:47.750 --> 48:50.642
Okay. All right.

48:50.666 --> 48:53.950
When do you want to go through
with your little plan, huh?

48:53.974 --> 48:54.974
Hmm?

48:58.805 --> 49:01.566
He's leaving in three
days for Salt Lake City.

49:01.590 --> 49:02.722
Hmm.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.444
He'll be gone a week.

49:17.389 --> 49:18.390
Okay.

49:19.391 --> 49:20.672
Ready?

49:20.696 --> 49:22.718
- Yeah!
- All right.

49:22.742 --> 49:23.830
Now come outside.

49:24.831 --> 49:25.875
Fuck!

49:29.096 --> 49:31.751
Hey. No, wait. Wait a minute!

49:32.926 --> 49:34.014
- What?
- Hang on.

49:35.059 --> 49:37.733
My camera's broken.

49:37.757 --> 49:40.388
- What?
- Fucking camera's broke.

49:40.412 --> 49:41.848
Let me see it.

49:46.505 --> 49:47.961
Oy!

49:47.985 --> 49:50.920
- Lens cap.
- Oh. Of course.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.791
Ooh, what now?

49:52.815 --> 49:54.793
Go back inside, do it again.

49:54.817 --> 49:56.689
- Oh!
- No big deal. Only this time...

49:57.690 --> 50:00.495
just, uh, act like
you don't notice me.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.497
You were kinda smiling
in that last take.

50:02.521 --> 50:04.566
- No, I wasn't.
- Gotta look natural.

50:05.785 --> 50:07.526
Okay.

50:10.703 --> 50:11.791
There she goes.

50:12.792 --> 50:13.943
Look at the ass.

50:16.361 --> 50:17.449
Here she comes.

50:18.450 --> 50:19.451
Huh.

50:20.452 --> 50:21.453
Looking good.

50:24.630 --> 50:26.066
Those tits and ass.

50:27.850 --> 50:29.026
Oh, good.

50:30.418 --> 50:31.743
Huh.

50:31.767 --> 50:33.030
Wait, hold on.

50:34.857 --> 50:36.033
What the fuck!

50:52.484 --> 50:53.615
Here we go.

50:54.921 --> 50:56.792
At this pretty liquor store.

50:58.098 --> 51:02.731
And who do we have here?

51:02.755 --> 51:05.038
Looking good.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.518
Oh yeah!

51:07.542 --> 51:08.587
Pretty.

51:10.806 --> 51:11.914
See,

51:11.938 --> 51:13.916
there's nothing to worry about.

51:13.940 --> 51:15.420
She's an alcoholic.

51:17.117 --> 51:18.684
And you thought she's
cheating on you.

51:20.207 --> 51:21.817
It's all in your mind.

52:28.014 --> 52:29.581
I made you lunch.

52:44.683 --> 52:46.598
What's the saddest thing
you've ever seen?

52:48.730 --> 52:49.905
Uh...

52:51.211 --> 52:53.866
I haven't really thought about it.
You?

52:56.608 --> 52:57.739
It was on the news.

53:01.003 --> 53:02.067
Mm-hmm.

53:02.091 --> 53:03.092
Funny thing though.

53:05.051 --> 53:07.508
It wasn't like the war or...

53:07.532 --> 53:09.664
some missing child or
anything like that.

53:13.538 --> 53:14.669
What was it?

53:18.107 --> 53:20.869
It was a story about a whale.

53:21.937 --> 53:23.548
A whale.

53:26.638 --> 53:27.900
It was a baby whale.

53:30.729 --> 53:32.929
He was lost off the
coast of Australia,

53:32.953 --> 53:34.578
and he had somehow
come across this yacht

53:34.602 --> 53:36.058
he thought was his mom.

53:36.082 --> 53:37.799
He kept on trying to, you know,

53:37.823 --> 53:39.888
suckle from the
side of this boat.

53:39.912 --> 53:41.792
But all the people on the
boat were watching him

53:41.816 --> 53:43.848
and they felt bad, but
what could they do?

53:43.872 --> 53:46.547
They tried to sail away, but
he kept following them.

53:46.571 --> 53:49.091
And I just kept thinking what that
poor whale must have thought,

53:49.115 --> 53:52.640
wondering why his mom had
suddenly turned so quiet

53:52.664 --> 53:53.839
and so cold.

53:55.754 --> 53:57.582
You really need
to get over this.

53:59.932 --> 54:01.238
Thanks a lot. That...

54:02.717 --> 54:04.676
That is really sage advice.

54:05.677 --> 54:07.350
Well, blame yourself.

54:07.374 --> 54:09.246
You're the one writing
the words I'm saying.

54:16.035 --> 54:17.254
You're right.

54:20.779 --> 54:22.955
No. Really, you are. You...

54:26.828 --> 54:28.221
It's just...

54:30.310 --> 54:32.007
so horrible.

54:37.796 --> 54:39.188
I'm so lost.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.020
This story doesn't
make any sense.

54:46.108 --> 54:47.849
It's like what you said before.

54:48.894 --> 54:49.982
Realism.

54:52.376 --> 54:54.029
If all else fails, just...

54:55.030 --> 54:58.164
go, go back to what
really happened.

55:01.210 --> 55:03.667
That's always your defense.

55:03.691 --> 55:05.651
If somebody doesn't like
it, you just say, "Pfft."

55:06.651 --> 55:08.000
Well, at least it was real."

55:10.655 --> 55:12.981
Everything in my life
is happening now,

55:13.005 --> 55:14.417
somehow.

55:14.441 --> 55:16.332
Somewhere.

55:16.356 --> 55:19.292
She is still here somehow.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.163
Somewhere.

55:21.187 --> 55:23.885
We are still together
in some different when.

55:25.713 --> 55:28.257
We have been hiking all day.

55:28.281 --> 55:31.347
She says she likes the way the
sunlight filters through the leaves.

55:31.371 --> 55:34.331
She says it makes her feel
restless in a good way.

55:36.158 --> 55:40.356
I tell her it feels like we
are in a scene from a movie.

55:40.380 --> 55:43.775
In three years and four
days, she will leave me.

55:46.821 --> 55:50.129
Her skin is dark.
Her hair is a mess.

56:03.011 --> 56:05.057
She is a goddess.

56:16.895 --> 56:20.309
We make love that night, and I
can smell sulfur on her skin.

56:20.333 --> 56:21.421
Faint.

56:22.509 --> 56:26.402
Cicadas an endless undulation.

56:26.426 --> 56:29.081
Dark things out there
moving in the forest.

56:37.263 --> 56:38.307
Hey.

56:42.790 --> 56:44.139
Hey, what is this?

56:45.837 --> 56:47.099
You're, uh...

56:48.100 --> 56:49.754
reading my new book.

56:51.233 --> 56:53.105
This is the new book?

56:56.108 --> 56:57.433
No, but this is our life.

56:57.457 --> 56:59.372
What, you don't like it?

57:01.548 --> 57:03.787
What are you talking about?

57:03.811 --> 57:06.747
What... Don't like it...
What you've written here

57:06.771 --> 57:08.879
are moments from our life.

57:08.903 --> 57:11.795
Private moments.

57:11.819 --> 57:16.104
Sweetheart, every writer's life
ends up in his work. It's just...

57:16.128 --> 57:18.062
No. No.

57:18.086 --> 57:19.803
Not these. Not these.

57:19.827 --> 57:22.415
These are personal details.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.765
I don't want people reading
about these things, okay.

57:24.789 --> 57:27.332
These are between you and me.

57:27.356 --> 57:28.401
I'm sorry. I...

57:29.794 --> 57:32.903
had no idea you would
be upset by this.

57:32.927 --> 57:34.949
You know, that's what upsets
me the most actually,

57:34.973 --> 57:38.822
that you thought that I
would be okay with this.

57:38.846 --> 57:41.477
With having our lives in a book
for millions of people to just...

57:41.501 --> 57:46.177
Yeah, not really millions yet,
but that is the general idea.

57:46.201 --> 57:47.986
Okay.

57:50.423 --> 57:52.338
I'm really disgusted
with you right now.

57:53.339 --> 57:54.949
- Disgusted?
- Yeah.

57:56.603 --> 57:58.953
Yeah, I just... I see
something that I don't like.

58:03.567 --> 58:05.133
What do you see?

58:06.134 --> 58:07.938
Can I ask you a question?

58:07.962 --> 58:10.375
Jacob, if I asked you
to take that stuff out

58:10.399 --> 58:12.039
and write something
else, would you do it?

58:14.403 --> 58:17.121
- You wouldn't do it, would you?
- Cassandra, it's...

58:17.145 --> 58:19.931
It's my best work.

58:21.628 --> 58:23.848
Sweetheart, I, I write...

58:24.979 --> 58:26.696
to make a better life for us.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.307
I've made a better life for us.
I've got us this place.

58:29.331 --> 58:31.116
There's my answer.

58:59.013 --> 59:00.537
I'd choose you.

59:02.234 --> 59:03.540
No, you wouldn't.

59:17.118 --> 59:18.250
Shh.

59:23.385 --> 59:26.582
I'm there, feeling her
breathing against me.

59:26.606 --> 59:28.758
Trapped.

59:28.782 --> 59:32.327
Knowing there's nothing I can
tell her for comfort but lies.

59:32.351 --> 59:35.484
In two months and four
days, she'll leave me.

59:38.096 --> 59:39.227
She's already gone...

59:40.881 --> 59:42.281
even though her body
is still there.

59:48.715 --> 59:51.022
It's just been in my
head all this time.

59:52.414 --> 59:54.373
Finally see it for
real, you know.

59:56.941 --> 59:59.441
Yeah, a movie, it's...

59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.598
Seriously, it's been one
of my biggest dreams.

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.254
What? This...

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.147
This doesn't excite you?

01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:11.671
No, I-I'm...

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:14.001
I'm excited for you.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:18.503
I just think we get excited about
very different things, you know.

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.462
We need different
things, you know.

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:22.446
What do you... What do you want?
What do you need?

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.950
I can... I can get it to you.

01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:27.425
I need a normal life.

01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:30.496
Um, I need a husband
and kids someday.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:33.301
But you're different, you know.

01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:35.205
You, you're doing what
you're meant to be doing.

01:00:35.229 --> 01:00:36.534
You have another purpose.

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:38.722
I'll quit.

01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:42.290
I'll quit right now. I-I just...

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:47.034
I just need you.

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.343
No, it's not that simple.

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:55.149
It's, uh, it's a catch-22.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:57.020
'Cause, you know, what
I love about you,

01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:59.980
and what I've always loved
about you is your talent

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.084
and your passion and if you
gave up your work for me,

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:04.850
you would be giving up the
thing I love most about you.

01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:08.490
What am I supposed to do?

01:01:11.406 --> 01:01:13.539
- Exactly what you are doing.
- Well, I can't.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:17.674
I can't. Not if you're unhappy.

01:01:19.284 --> 01:01:21.068
- Of course you can.
- Just...

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.550
Let's start over.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.684
Leave all of this behind.

01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:33.622
I can be happy with you
no matter where we are.

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:38.018
But, Jacob, like, just stop and think
about what you're saying for a second.

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:39.584
Just consider, like,

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:42.568
you know, you in a small
house, in a small town,

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:46.528
a small job, a small life.

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:52.230
Would that really
make you happy?

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.257
In eight days, she
will leave me.

01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:02.825
The moments we've shared
will start fading

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:05.219
like film negatives
left in the sun.

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:07.525
- If you unders...
- All night and all morning...

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.571
- If you understood me...
- Oh, I don't understand...

01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:10.703
- Oh, I must be so stupid to not

01:02:10.715 --> 01:02:11.834
understand.
- If you knew me better,

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:14.338
- you wouldn't be asking this.
- What it takes to write a book.

01:02:14.362 --> 01:02:16.016
- Let me do my work.
- Fine, fine.

01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:35.752
This is good.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:37.796
Yeah.

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:42.367
I, uh...

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.720
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:51.855
Yeah?

01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.252
What?

01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:01.318
Uh...

01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:02.779
baby, it's time.

01:03:04.432 --> 01:03:05.738
It's past time.

01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:10.414
I-I've loved you since
the day we first met.

01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:12.329
You're the best person
I've ever known.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.713
There is no one else in the world
I want to be with but you.

01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:22.252
I, I know you worry
about my work, but...

01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:25.149
you're my muse. You
inspire me to be better.

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:28.413
Jake, I don't... I don't...
I, uh...

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:31.305
I don't know what to say.

01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:34.158
Well, it's, it's just one word.

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:41.837
Um... Okay, I want to
talk about this, okay?

01:03:41.861 --> 01:03:43.515
What's, what's there
to talk about?

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.213
Will you marry me?

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:52.306
I saw this ring, and
I knew it was time.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:04:00.880
I saw our... whole
life together.

01:04:02.229 --> 01:04:03.840
I saw us with babies...

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:09.430
I saw us with grown-up kids,

01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:13.521
when we're all old and
covered with wrinkles,

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:16.722
and all we do is sit in the
same room and read all day.

01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:22.965
I saw 50 Christmases.

01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:26.882
I saw trips to Europe.

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:30.692
Every moment I've ever looked
forward to involves you.

01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:37.743
I-I-I want you to
be with me, now.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.761
Baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:04:58.677 --> 01:04:59.983
What am I supposed to do?

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:04.726
I-I thought I could
be happy, but...

01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:09.818
All I ever wanted was just
to be everything to you.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.387
You absolutely are.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.393
I'm not.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:36.628
Can you ever truly erase
something from your memories?

01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:40.608
Or can you just push it down?

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:44.003
Kick it into the shadows until
you can no longer see it.

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:47.310
But so much pain can't just
remain hidden forever,

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:49.399
no matter where you hide it.

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:52.272
Every bit of pain and
love and sadness

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:55.449
we have ever felt is still
somewhere in our minds.

01:05:55.473 --> 01:05:57.799
Changed, perhaps...

01:05:57.823 --> 01:05:58.955
but never gone.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:05.415
One month and fourteen
days since she left.

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:09.376
Five years, eight months,
twenty-four days ago we met.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.987
I tell myself that every one
of those moments still exists,

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.424
somewhere in time.

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:17.340
I tell myself we just
met at that funeral.

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:18.409
Hey, Jake.

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:24.304
Hey, Jake.

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:25.522
I tell myself

01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.089
we are lying on a warm rock

01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:29.396
beside a cool creek in a forest

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.875
where the leaves shiver

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:32.510
and the sunlight
dapples the ground.

01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:37.906
I said, "Hey, Jake!"

01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:43.062
I tell myself we're
floating in that lake,

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:46.108
our bodies unattached
from the world.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:48.004
Her warmth against
me in the cold.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.678
Hey.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:52.399
What's happening?

01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:59.406
Nice robe, brother.

01:07:10.548 --> 01:07:12.898
You know, you're gonna
drown those plants, man.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.773
They're just plants.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:23.667
Well, hey, look, you damn well
know I'm not a psychologist,

01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:26.018
but if you wanna come
over and complain...

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:28.914
I got beer.

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:37.140
Thanks.

01:07:45.887 --> 01:07:46.975
Hey.

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.390
You said come over if...

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:51.956
I wanted to complain.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.418
Right. Didn't expect it so soon.

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:57.464
It's funny.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.425
I don't miss my mother.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.012
Huh?

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:06.406
She died three years ago.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:07.648
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:09.737
Like I said.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:12.803
I don't miss her.

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:14.568
Okay.

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.147
When she went...

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:31.497
I hadn't seen her
in over a year.

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:34.935
I used to go home
a lot, then less.

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:39.178
I still loved her,
still love her.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:43.617
But that's the thing. The
love wasn't immediate.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.533
It was all tied up
in these memories.

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:50.474
There were these warm...
happy memories.

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:53.651
Now, I'm worried.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.502
I'm worried that the same
thing is gonna happen to her.

01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:00.571
That...

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.462
I won't miss her anymore.

01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:05.010
That she won't be immediate...

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.621
anymore.

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:11.886
Cassandra didn't die, did she?

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:15.823
No.

01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:18.545
Oh, God. Thank God for that.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.765
She's still alive.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.203
Thanks.

01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.555
Thanks for listening.

01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:33.821
Of course. Glad I could help.

01:09:34.908 --> 01:09:36.520
You know, Cassandra...

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:40.263
she always liked you.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.569
She thought you were hilarious.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.984
That's a compliment, I think.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.575
Yeah.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:52.666
You didn't...

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.690
You never fucked her, did you?

01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:58.779
Christ!

01:09:58.803 --> 01:10:00.065
What kind of question is that?

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.633
So... no?

01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:09.030
Of course not.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.689
Cool.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:23.654
See you later.

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.663
Fucking nutbag.

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:37.209
Five years.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:40.821
I despair this masterpiece
may never get finished.

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:43.084
I'm close. I'm close.

01:10:43.108 --> 01:10:45.110
I'm just trying to end it.

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:50.091
The end is the most
important part of a story.

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:52.093
Once you've taken
them on this journey,

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:53.573
you can't just leave them.

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:56.600
Things have to wrap up properly.

01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:01.605
I want to end it with a quote.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.738
Any quote?

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:07.872
That's the thing. I don't know.

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:13.332
A quote that ends the
story perfectly.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.879
The story of her.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.121
Say, that's not a bad title. What
do you think, "The Story of Her?"

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.233
I don't like it.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.400
So you're just looking
for any old quote?

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.327
I invented my own.

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:32.157
About her.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.292
About our story.

01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:42.404
Drumroll?

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.690
Not necessary.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.304
It goes like this:

01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:52.786
"What does the sun
have to fear?"

01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:56.331
"For he looks down and
sees all the world,"

01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:57.835
"and all the people on it,"

01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:02.187
"and they look to him, and
they are lit by him,"

01:12:03.928 --> 01:12:05.843
"and they cannot
live without him."

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:10.804
"He grows the plants
that feeds them, and..."

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:14.721
"heats the air that warms them."

01:12:17.028 --> 01:12:18.856
"They are his friends."

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.427
"But what of the night?"

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.344
"Which does nothing
but scare..."

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:31.347
"and make it hard
for people to see."

01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:36.719
"It has but the moon, whose
glow is ever changing"

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:38.702
"and fickle as the
passing of time."

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:45.404
"Only the stars
are its friends."

01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:51.367
"And what sayeth the night..."

01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:54.457
"when the starlight ends?"

01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:58.417
I like it.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:17.044
Really?

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:26.402
Hello.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:31.494
Huh?

01:13:33.104 --> 01:13:34.801
No, that's great.

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:40.435
Listen, man. Listen.
I hate reading.

01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:42.437
I hate to read...

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:44.787
and I stayed up all
night last night.

01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:47.834
And I'm telling you, this
is your masterpiece.

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.294
And I'm telling you thanks.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.273
And as usual, you're
being an asshole.

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:53.429
I'm sorry.

01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:55.755
I'm sorry. You're right. I...

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:02.936
I just... I got to
thinking about her.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.310
For real? It's been five years.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.245
You've got to get
over this chick.

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:09.856
You've got to move on.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.597
I mean, it's great and all.

01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:14.251
All that angst or whatever
that brought you to this book.

01:14:14.275 --> 01:14:17.167
But really, you need to move on.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:21.041
Listen, you're great.
This is great.

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:22.745
Now, you need to go out
there and get laid.

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:25.461
Thanks.

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.465
I, uh...

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:33.338
I'm gonna go see her.

01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:36.926
What do you think's
gonna happen?

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:39.320
I don't think anything's
gonna happen.

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:40.345
I just have to know...

01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:43.304
if I made the right
choice or not.

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:46.576
If I should have
fought to keep her.

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.486
If I should have given
all of this up.

01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:57.207
One day since I called her

01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.311
and heard her voice for the
first time in five years.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.343
I told her I was in town,

01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:05.085
that I had tracked her
down through a friend.

01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:07.609
She didn't know if it was a good
idea for us to see each other.

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:09.350
I said it was.

01:15:09.374 --> 01:15:11.918
Just to catch up.
Have a mellow chat.

01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:13.204
That was what I said.

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.452
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:15:45.453 --> 01:15:46.585
It's good to see you.

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.346
You're pregnant.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:50.546
Yeah.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.332
- Come on in.
- Sure.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.294
Here.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.570
This is really great iced-tea.

01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:18.158
You, uh, make it from scratch?

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.509
No, I buy it at the shop.

01:16:21.533 --> 01:16:24.536
It's like five bucks
for 20 bottles.

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:26.973
It's delicious.

01:16:29.019 --> 01:16:30.910
You're not, uh...

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:32.675
Oh, no, caffeine's
not good for...

01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:36.200
- Oh.
- I get it for Al.

01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:40.596
Al?

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.575
- That's his name, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.948
Al.

01:16:46.558 --> 01:16:49.015
Al.

01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:52.932
Is that short for something?
Alfred? Alvin? Alowishus?

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:54.566
Alan.

01:16:55.567 --> 01:16:57.656
- The next one I was gonna say.
- Oh.

01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:04.141
Yeah, I was surprised
when you called actually.

01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:11.322
You know, I tried to get in touch
a few years ago after we, uh...

01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:15.128
I thought we could be friends.

01:17:15.152 --> 01:17:16.303
I was still pretty bitter.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:17.633
Yeah.

01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:24.659
I'm sorry if it's... weird

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.251
me coming up here. I just...
It's uh...

01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:32.735
I, uh... just finished
my latest book.

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.148
It's the one about you.

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:38.349
The... one I've been
working on forever.

01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.546
I, uh, I just finished it,

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.137
and I don't know, it...

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:48.359
it felt right coming up here
to see you for some reason.

01:17:50.187 --> 01:17:51.536
For closure?

01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:53.712
I guess.

01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:00.240
I've read all your work.

01:18:01.241 --> 01:18:02.610
Uh, the stuff
you've been writing

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.201
while finishing
that one, I guess.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:07.378
The novel, the spy novel.

01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:10.400
And I saw "Tears of... ".

01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:11.599
Oh, yeah.

01:18:13.558 --> 01:18:16.406
Yeah. I've been pretty busy.

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:17.518
Yeah.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:19.651
You got a girl?

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.048
Sometimes.

01:18:27.528 --> 01:18:28.704
Good for you.

01:18:31.184 --> 01:18:33.099
What's your last name now?

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.146
Miller.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.279
Cassandra Miller.

01:18:40.585 --> 01:18:42.456
Alan Miller.

01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:47.374
I like it.

01:18:48.636 --> 01:18:52.162
Because it's, uh... exotic.

01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:57.099
It's not all that
different from Silver.

01:18:57.123 --> 01:18:58.255
No.

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:01.258
No, just a few letters.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:04.435
And a totally different guy.

01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:12.095
I was, uh...

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:17.554
I was talking to my agent,
Don, the other day,

01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:18.860
you remember Don?

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.167
Yeah, I think so.

01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:25.519
I-I told him I was coming
up here because...

01:19:25.543 --> 01:19:28.285
I wanted to see if I'd
made the right choice.

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:33.396
You know, with how things went,

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.292
in the end with you and I.

01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:39.252
And?

01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:43.256
I feel weird talking about it.

01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:47.521
I mean...

01:19:48.522 --> 01:19:50.307
can the baby hear us?

01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:53.112
Well, I, uh,

01:19:53.136 --> 01:19:55.505
don't want him hearing

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:58.619
some other guy, some other dude
you used to have sex with.

01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:02.406
Could be, uh, confusing for him.

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:05.626
It's a girl.

01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:07.672
A girl?

01:20:12.503 --> 01:20:14.263
And, no, I think it's fine.

01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:16.681
Just don't start yelling
at me or anything.

01:20:18.509 --> 01:20:20.163
Yelling at you?

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.665
I'm not really the yelling type.

01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:27.735
No, I know. Yeah.

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:30.826
You were always really patient.

01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:37.199
Whoa!

01:20:37.223 --> 01:20:38.722
Well, she just kicked.

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.507
Oh.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.552
Here, you wanna feel?

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:44.816
In 41 minutes, I will walk out.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.470
I will hug her, being careful
not to press my stomach

01:20:47.494 --> 01:20:49.168
too hard against her stomach,

01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:50.778
because I don't want
to squish her baby

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:53.607
or fold it in half or something.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:55.609
She will say we
should keep in touch.

01:20:55.633 --> 01:20:57.350
I will say I will.

01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:59.787
She will smile and
close the door.

01:20:59.811 --> 01:21:01.920
I will walk to my car.

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:03.380
I won't look back.

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:10.276
In one hour and 11 minutes,
I will be in my car

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.365
on the way to the airport.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.976
I will start crying suddenly,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.326
and then I will stop.

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:20.373
Like those summer rainstorms
that come and go so fast,

01:21:20.397 --> 01:21:21.702
it's like it never happened.

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:26.533
Then... I'll rewrite the future.

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:35.214
In this alternate
timeline, she says yes

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:36.911
when I ask her to marry me.

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.566
We make love that night,
and she gets pregnant.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:42.917
Al Miller died in a horrible
sky-diving accident.

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:45.877
No big deal, since neither
of us ever met him.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.922
Our son's name is Morgan.

01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:50.011
She always loved that
name, and I say it's fine

01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:52.646
as long as we never start
shortening it to become Morg.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.944
Chelsea and David come later.

01:22:09.968 --> 01:22:11.772
Chelsea becomes a doctor.

01:22:11.796 --> 01:22:13.687
David joins the army for a week,

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.800
then leaves because he
says it's too hard.

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:19.998
He goes to film school.
He wins an Oscar.

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:23.001
He thanks his mom and
says I'm his inspiration.

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:25.549
He gets a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:34.969
Morgan is a star
tailback in high school.

01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:38.277
He is drafted by L.A.'s
new football team.

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:39.800
In this alternate universe,

01:22:39.824 --> 01:22:42.324
L.A. finally has
a football team.

01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:45.023
They are terrible, until
Morgan comes along.

01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:48.572
Then they win an unprecedented
three straight Super-Bowls.

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:55.511
Cassandra and I get old.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.407
Our bones don't work
so good anymore.

01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:00.647
We have to wear diapers.

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:03.824
Her glasses get
thicker every year.

01:23:03.848 --> 01:23:06.087
I wear a hearing-aid, and
she's always nagging at me

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:08.070
to turn it up because I
always can't hear her.

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.658
We never get Alzheimer's.

01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:13.312
We always remember each other,

01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:14.728
right up until the day we die.

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:18.491
We die on the same day,

01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:20.038
so neither of us
is alone at all.

01:23:22.127 --> 01:23:24.671
The last thing she ever asks me

01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:26.001
is if I made the right choice.

01:23:27.654 --> 01:23:29.004
I ask her if she's happy.

01:23:31.049 --> 01:23:32.529
She says of course she is.

01:23:34.835 --> 01:23:36.054
Then I just smile.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.709
That's my answer.

01:23:39.305 --> 01:23:45.686
