[music playing]

01:20.240 --> 01:24.480
[music playing]

01:24.560 --> 01:27.480
Ach! The mountain creaks to its bones.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.760
It is a wild night beyond the gates.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.200
Is there any other kind, on Fenris?

01:33.280 --> 01:39.000
No, the world always saves its fury
for nights like these.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.320
Hm.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.600
So serious, Njal!

01:43.080 --> 01:45.200
Maybe just an unlucky storm.

01:45.640 --> 01:49.720
No such thing as luck, Ulrik.
Or so he’ll tell you.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.640
Aye. It is fate that guides the pieces.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.120
No, our hands guide the pieces
on this board, and it is fate

02:00.200 --> 02:04.920
that guides the aspirants who may yet
bring us reinforcements this night.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.360
[Ulrik] The two are separate.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.760
[Krom] So you always say, when you win.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.920
[Krom] Which you rarely do.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.960
[all laugh]

02:16.600 --> 02:19.280
But perhaps this night, eh, Krom?

02:19.360 --> 02:20.760
That whelp you chose

02:20.840 --> 02:24.360
will not be bringing you
an extra fang to play this game tonight.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.520
Mark my words.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.400
Now,

02:28.480 --> 02:29.760
let us play.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.480
Hmm.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.400
[sniffs]

02:37.000 --> 02:38.040
[beast bellows]

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
[gasps]

02:42.080 --> 02:43.080
Umm.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.320
Ahh.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.000
Do you think your choice of pup
will fare better than your luck

02:48.080 --> 02:50.000
upon this board, Slayer?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.560
[mug slams]

02:51.640 --> 02:54.600
A hardier aspirant I’ve rarely seen.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.200
That one’s got bite.

02:57.280 --> 03:04.280
[music playing]

03:05.080 --> 03:06.120

03:16.600 --> 03:21.480
[panting]

03:22.280 --> 03:26.480
[pouring]
Pah! He’s nothing but an enthusiastic pup.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.560
The only safe bet was the runt

03:29.280 --> 03:31.960
if you wanted an extra piece
to save your hide.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.760
That wiry little bastard
will outlive us all.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.720
[gasping]

03:40.800 --> 03:45.360
[panting]

03:45.440 --> 03:52.440
[dramatic music]

03:54.480 --> 03:55.640
[Njal sighs]

03:55.720 --> 03:58.280
We shall see which returns.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.280
We must trust to fate
that which we cannot see.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.720
But enough!

04:04.360 --> 04:08.320
There are still moves
to be played upon this board.

04:11.200 --> 04:18.200
[atmospheric music]

04:18.440 --> 04:20.760

[footsteps]

04:32.280 --> 04:34.080
[low growl]

04:40.800 --> 04:41.920
[Krom] So tell me, Slayer.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Do the tests still answer?

04:44.400 --> 04:48.800
Are they as hard now as they ever were,
when we were out on the ice?

04:49.600 --> 04:52.120
Aye, the tests still answer.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.440
Do you miss it, Krom?
The fire in your blood

04:56.520 --> 04:59.600
from when you
were still young and foolish?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.040
[growls]

05:01.120 --> 05:03.600
The fire is still there.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.560
Ask the dead greenskins on Alaric Prime.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.880
But it burns more slowly, my friend.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.040
[Krom] Perhaps. But it matters little.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.920
I have lived, I have fought.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.840
Death will come for me one day,
and I care not.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.600
It is glorious, my brothers

05:23.240 --> 05:26.000
to die as a son of Russ.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.760
There is no greater prize.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.920
If they do not come back... [sighs]

05:31.560 --> 05:35.360
Then that is the way of this world,
and always has been.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.800
We are all on our second lives, here.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.000

06:58.560 --> 06:59.640

06:59.720 --> 07:02.640
Hell’s teeth! I may be out for now

07:02.720 --> 07:07.280
but I can still claw back a victory when
my whelp returns with a fresh piece.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.440
[Krom chuckles]

07:08.520 --> 07:10.840
It was a poor move, brother.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.920
Ach. I felt it in my bones

07:14.320 --> 07:19.320
this damned cold, this damned storm.
Not my night.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.880
Then you should not have wagered
on it so heavily.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.160
[lips smack] Ahh.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.760
Why are you always so damned gloomy?

07:29.080 --> 07:32.000
Have another drink, crack a smile.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.920
He won’t drink too much. He seeks to win.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.560
Pah!

07:37.640 --> 07:41.160
And you’ll do your utmost to stop me.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.200
Aye – even you can’t foresee everything.

07:45.280 --> 07:49.080
None of us here knows
how our chosen ones fair in the wilds.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.040
Now play!

10:08.880 --> 10:10.120
Hm.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.440
So, another piece down.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.120
I didn’t see that move.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.520
Didn’t see it at all.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.800
Not all the pieces are accounted for yet.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.160
Our aspirants might yet
change the outcome in our favour.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.280

Not for any of us, it seems.

But it is not yet over.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.400
[laughs]

12:58.440 --> 13:01.280
Maybe you should learn when to quit,
Rune Priest.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.240
Do you think your choice of pup
will still bring you an extra piece?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.760
On some nights

13:08.840 --> 13:10.600
none succeed.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.200
Aye, that can be true.

here late, aspirant.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.000
We might have ended this already.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.640
A fine piece!

15:10.080 --> 15:14.320
Allfather only knows
what you took that from, pup.

15:15.160 --> 15:20.400
Go now. Rest.
Your work this night is done.

15:21.160 --> 15:26.520
Tomorrow,
the Trial of Morkai shall truly begin.

Aye. So it is.
