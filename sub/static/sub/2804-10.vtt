09:13.988 --> 09:16.077
I'M CONVINCED THERE'S
A SECRET FBI HANDSHAKE,

09:16.164 --> 09:17.731
AND NOW IS THE TIME
TO USE IT.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.428
THERE IS NO
SECRET HANDSHAKE.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.472
OF COURSE
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D SAY.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.430
Peter:
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.518

YOU HAVE YOUR BADGES.

WELL-ATTENDED PANELS.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.395
Peter:
IDENTITY THEFT'S IN AN HOUR.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.440
IT'S ALWAYS PACKED.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.484
THEY PASS OUT COOKIES.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.407
ARE WE ALL SET
TO RECORD THIS?

09:42.494 --> 09:43.800
ALL GOOD.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.194
THIS PANEL IS ABOUT
IDENTITY THEFT.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.458
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE IMMUNE BECAUSE YOU'RE TRAINED AGENTS,

09:49.545 --> 09:51.199
THINK AGAIN.

I THINK YOU ALL KNOW

AT SOMETHING ELSE.

YOU'RE KIDDING ME.I'M NOT.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.493
THAT WASN'T THE DEAL.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.755
WHILE I DISTRACTED YOU

10:25.842 --> 10:27.017
BY PICKING A PIECE OF LINT
OFF YOUR SUIT.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.125
BACK IN A SEC.
I'M GONNA THANK AGENT FURLONG.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.866
THAT WAS
A PRETTY BOLD MOVE.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.128
SOMEBODY HAD TO DO IT.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.869

10:52.956 --> 10:54.305
NO, NOTHING YET.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.874
THANKS FOR BEING
A GOOD SPORT, WALT.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.876

[ SIGHS ]
WE PULLED IT OFF.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.941
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.291
I REALLY THOUGHT REACHING OUT
TO SAM WAS A GOOD IDEA.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.815
I THOUGHT SAM DID, AS WELL.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.555
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY CAUGHT ON TO HIM

12:10.642 --> 12:12.122
OR WHO CAUGHT ON TO HIM,

12:12.209 --> 12:14.690
BUT HE COULD'VE HANDLED IT
BETTER BEFORE SKIPPING TOWN.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.083
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SAM WENT?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.519
NO.

I'VE GOT WALT FURLONG
ASKING AROUND IN D.C.,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.219

CAN FIND HIM.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.308
WELL, IF WALT FINDS ANYTHING,
YOU NEED TO TELL NEAL.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.834
I WILL, BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'LL WANT TO HEAR IT.

YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE BOWLING PARTY,

12:29.661 --> 12:31.141

SO, HOW DID THINGS GO
AT THE SUIT CONVENTION?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.676
WE'RE BACK TO A STATUS QUO
I CAN WORK WITH.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.027
OH, SO HE'S SUSPICIOUS
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING,

12:47.114 --> 12:49.290

HELL OF A DYNAMIC
YOU GOT THERE.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.510
WELL, IT HAS ITS PERKS.

12:52.597 --> 12:53.990
I COULD SLIP OUT
WITH ONE OF THESE.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.950
STATE-OF-THE-ART

12:57.037 --> 12:58.778
IT EMBEDS IN THE SKIN
LIKE A TICK.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.041
THE SUBJECT IS COMPLETELY
UNAWARE IT'S THERE.

13:01.128 --> 13:04.044
SO WE BAIT WHOEVER'S AFTER SAM,
THEN PLANT THAT IN THEM.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.523
HOW DO WE BAIT OUT
OUR TARGET?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.091
SURVEILLANCE-AUTHORIZATION
FORM.

13:08.178 --> 13:10.659
WE PLANT INFORMATION TO LURE OUT

WE CONTROL THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.316
WE NEED A SECURE LOCATION.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.754
WE CAN USE FRIDAY,
MY THIRD-FAVORITE SAFE HOUSE.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.191
ALL RIGHT, IT TAKES EIGHT HOURS
FOR THIS FORM TO BE PROCESSED.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.758
IF WE FILE IT
TOMORROW MORNING,

13:22.845 --> 13:24.978
OUR SURPRISE GUEST COULD SHOW UP
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.154
WON'T A COUPLE OF AGENTS END UP
SITTING ON THE SAFE HOUSE?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.808
IF PETER DOESN'T KNOW
HE'S AUTHORIZED,

13:28.895 --> 13:30.331
THEN HE WON'T ASSIGN
ANYONE TO IT.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.072
GREAT.
SO, FORGE HIS SIGNATURE.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.074
UNFORTUNATELY,
I CAN'T FORGE IT.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.902

THAT SIMPLE.

EVERY THURSDAY MORNING,

13:37.425 --> 13:39.253
DIANA READIES A STACK
OF SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS

13:39.340 --> 13:41.081
FOR PETER TO SIGN.

13:44.736 --> 13:45.825
ONCE HE FINISHES,

13:45.912 --> 13:47.174
SHE TAKES THEM DIRECTLY
TO THE AGENT

13:47.261 --> 13:48.262
IN CHARGE OF LOGGING THEM.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.959
NO WEAK LINKS IN THE CHAIN.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.309
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO CON PETER.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.963
YEAH, WHICH WON'T BE EASY.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.662
SURVEILLANCE AUTHORIZATIONS --
MUST BE THURSDAY.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.839
NOW, DIANA PREPS THE FORMS,
BUT PETER SCANS EACH ONE

13:59.926 --> 14:01.536
AND DOUBLE-CHECKS THE COUNT
WHEN HE'S DONE.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.059
EIGHT OF THEM THIS WEEK.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.670
Sam: CAN YOU REPLACE ONE OF
THE FORMS WITH YOUR FAKE?

14:05.757 --> 14:08.021
Neal: I COULD, BUT PETER LIKES
TO SWITCH UP THE COLOR OF INK

14:08.108 --> 14:09.413
HE USES
WHEN HE SIGNS HIS NAME.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.502
IT'S A HABIT OF HIS SINCE
WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.461
INCREDIBLY PARANOID
AND PRESUMPTIVE OF HIM.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.679
I RESPECT THAT.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.420
THE ONLY WAY
TO PULL THIS OFF

14:16.507 --> 14:18.945
IS TO TRICK PETER INTO SIGNING
THE DOCUMENT HIMSELF.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.555
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A DISTRACTION.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.600
ANY LEADS
ON OUR FBI IMPOSTER?

14:22.687 --> 14:24.211

14:38.703 --> 14:40.444
IN MANY WAYS,
I LIVE THROUGH HIM.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.576
MANY WAYS?

14:41.663 --> 14:42.751
Neal:
DON'T GET HIM STARTED.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.753
ONCE PETER'S
SCANNED THE LAST FORM,

14:44.840 --> 14:46.320
BUT BEFORE HE SIGNS IT...

14:53.849 --> 14:55.155
AAH!

14:55.242 --> 14:58.898
RAT! RAT!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.203
CAN I GET
A LITTLE HELP HERE?!

OF THAT TAIL!

15:05.730 --> 15:08.342

15:08.429 --> 15:10.518
WAIT A SECOND.
OKAY.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.693
ALL RIGHT.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.347

15:13.434 --> 15:15.697
FOR EVERY ONE YOU SEE,
THERE'S ABOUT 10 YOU DON'T SEE.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.438
HEY, I SAW "RATATOUILLE."

15:17.525 --> 15:20.093
ANYBODY GOT EYES
ON THAT THING?!

15:20.180 --> 15:21.572
ANYBODY?!

15:21.659 --> 15:23.487
AND IF ALL THAT WORKS...

15:25.968 --> 15:29.972
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.409
THERE YOU GO.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.933

ANY LUCK FINDING
OUR MYSTERY GUEST?

15:45.205 --> 15:48.077
FOUR AGENTS DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY
PAT THEIR POCKETS.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.210
OH, THAT'S BOB SANDERS.
HE WAS HUNG OVER.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.125
Neal: THAT GUY'S BUSY
CHECKING HIS BlackBerry.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.256
AND SHE'S YAWNING.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.257
AND THE FOURTH?

15:54.344 --> 15:55.519
Jones: NOT AN AGENT.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.912
I JUST GOT THE
FACIAL-RECOGNITION RESULTS.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.348
MEET TED ANDERSON.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.524
HE WAS A FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
MARINE IN THE GULF WAR.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.092
AFTER THAT, HE DID FIVE YEARS
IN IRAQ -- FREELANCE SECURITY.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.615
LATELY HE'S BEEN CONSULTING

16:04.702 --> 16:06.008
WITH SOME WELL-KNOWN
TECH COMPANIES.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.009
PRIVATE SECURITY?

16:07.096 --> 16:08.402
IT DOESN'T SAY.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.491
WHY HIDE THE FACT
THAT HE'S WORKING SECURITY?

16:10.578 --> 16:12.101
BECAUSE HE'S ENGAGED
IN CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.233
SOUNDS RIGHT.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.277
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

16:14.364 --> 16:15.452
WHICH OF THE ITEMS
IS HE AFTER?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.324
LET'S TALK TO HIM
AND FIND OUT.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.978
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO SPOOK HIM.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.154
YEAH. HE MIGHT ALREADY RECOGNIZE
US FROM THE PANEL.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.025
JONES AND DIANA
WILL DO THE MEET.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.071
LET'S GET EYES ON ANDERSON
AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.466
FURLONG E-MAILED ME
SAM'S RETIREMENT INFORMATION.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.816
LET ME GUESS --
SHUFFLEBOARD AFTER BREAKFAST,

16:31.903 --> 16:33.340
CHESS AT 2:00,
DINNER AT 4:00?

16:33.427 --> 16:34.950
UNKNOWN.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.908
ALL IT SHOWS
IS THAT HE RETIRED

16:36.996 --> 16:38.127
ON A BOAT
IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.781
FLORIDA?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.348
YEAH, WHEN NEAL
FIRST REACHED OUT TO SAM,

16:41.435 --> 16:42.523
HE WAS IN D.C.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.872
NOW FURLONG IS TELLING ME

16:43.959 --> 16:45.352
THAT SAM RETIRED
TO THE SUNSHINE STATE.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.049
YOU WANT ME
TO LOOK INTO IT?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.095
NO, I WANT YOU TO GET READY
FOR THE ANDERSON MEET.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.835
I'LL REACH OUT
TO THE PEOPLE IN MIAMI,

16:50.922 --> 16:53.012
SEE IF THEY CAN TELL US
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING DOWN THERE.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.622
WITHOUT MAKING
AN OFFICIAL REPORT.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.146
MAYBE I'M INTERVIEWING
FBI RETIREES

16:57.233 --> 16:58.974
FOR AN ALUMNI NEWSLETTER.
