00:05.735 --> 00:08.646
<i> for none other than Quinn,
the super-spicy captain</i>

00:08.681 --> 00:11.030
<i> he hasn't stopped thinking
about for the past five years.</i>

00:11.040 --> 00:13.160
<i> What a loser!
Ha ha ha!</i>

00:13.195 --> 00:15.240
<i> Oh, and Quinn is on the run
from the Infinity Guard?</i>

00:15.275 --> 00:17.757
<i>Whoa! We've had our fun.</i>

00:17.758 --> 00:20.240
<i>Get ready to have yours.</i>

00:25.335 --> 00:29.505
<i>Gary, you have six
minutes of oxygen left.</i>

00:30.710 --> 00:33.310
It can't be.

00:33.345 --> 00:35.045
<i> What are you doing, Gary?</i>

00:35.075 --> 00:37.541
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm gonna consume its power.

00:37.726 --> 00:39.860
<i> But opening your helmet
will blow out your internals,</i>

00:39.895 --> 00:41.730
<i>inducing instantaneous death.</i>

00:41.765 --> 00:43.530
That's one possible outcome.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.000
Another, I eat the cookie,
and its power turns me

00:46.035 --> 00:48.070

space-breathing manticore.

00:48.105 --> 00:50.610
<i> You will die before
you eat the cookie.</i>

00:50.645 --> 00:53.340
I'm pretty sure I could get it
in there before I die.

00:53.350 --> 00:56.480
<i> - That is not possible, Gary.
- I really think I can do it.</i>

00:56.515 --> 00:59.820
I'm gonna lob it right in
and close the helmet super fast.

00:59.855 --> 01:01.089
<i> You can't, Gary.</i>

My name is Quinn Airgone,
a captain in the Infinity Guard.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.730
I've been investigating
a gravitational disturbance,

01:46.765 --> 01:48.730
which I now see
is a breach in space.

01:48.765 --> 01:53.740
Many people are dead, and I'm
about to join them unless...

01:53.775 --> 01:58.010
Aah! Is there not a single idiot
that can hear me?!

01:58.175 --> 02:00.704
I can hear her.

02:01.375 --> 02:04.610
The greatest love story
in the history of the universe

02:04.645 --> 02:06.044
is about to blossom forth.

02:06.045 --> 02:08.949
Yo, dude, just keep
the expectations in check.

02:08.985 --> 02:12.524
Quinn hasn't responded to a single
message of yours in five years.

02:12.525 --> 02:15.724
- People get busy. I'm busy.
- For five years?

02:15.725 --> 02:18.490
4 years, 11 months and 30 days.

02:18.525 --> 02:20.760
- That's five years, bro.
- Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't.

02:20.795 --> 02:22.830
- It is.
- But it could not be.

02:22.865 --> 02:25.700
<i>Disabled transporter

Over my hard nipples, H.U.E.!

02:29.335 --> 02:31.770
If anyone is saving Quinn,
it's me, the captain.

02:31.805 --> 02:35.710
<i>Gary, for what is the 9,045th time,</i>

02:35.745 --> 02:37.910
<i>- you are still a prisoner.
- I disagree.</i>

02:37.945 --> 02:40.380
As soon as the crap
hit the interstellar fan,

02:40.415 --> 02:42.310
I became the captain for real.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.884
<i> Calculating... no.</i>

02:43.885 --> 02:48.190
Calculating, yes. I will use
those powers to rescue Quinn.

<i> One week has been added

02:50.825 --> 02:52.730

02:52.765 --> 02:54.164
What's new?

02:54.165 --> 02:56.200
Now, before I risk my life
for the woman I love,

02:56.235 --> 02:58.460
does anyone perchance
have a breath mint?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.800
- Right here, Gary.
- Ach! Oh!

03:00.835 --> 03:02.800
God, no, I'm killing my best friend!

03:02.835 --> 03:04.740
Let KVN get it.
I can do it.

03:04.775 --> 03:06.444
I'm close.
It's right there.

03:06.445 --> 03:10.340
Whoa, KVN, stay away,
far away from me forever!

03:10.375 --> 03:12.410
Oh, my God! Ugh!

03:17.985 --> 03:20.490
Aah!

03:28.395 --> 03:31.430
Commencing rescue.
Commencing destiny.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.480
Nice work. I need
to commandeer your ship.

04:16.515 --> 04:18.279
I have a class-three priority.

04:18.315 --> 04:21.810
Quinn, you look every bit as spicy

04:21.820 --> 04:24.820
as the last time I saw you.

04:24.855 --> 04:28.324
- Great, and you are again?
- Oh-ho-ho!

04:28.325 --> 04:30.760
How I've missed
your razor-sharp wit.

04:30.795 --> 04:32.969
No, seriously, I have
no idea who you are.

04:33.004 --> 04:35.130
- Really?
- You resemble no one

04:35.142 --> 04:37.488
- I know, so, yeah, really.
- Seriously?

04:37.523 --> 04:40.374
- Seriously.
- Oh, dear Lord, you're suffering from amnesia!

04:40.409 --> 04:44.482
I'm suffering from an emergency
that's going to destroy Earth.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.640
Quinn, you really expect me to believe

04:47.675 --> 04:48.874
you don't know who I am?

04:48.875 --> 04:50.980
Hold on.
I know how to fix this.

04:51.015 --> 04:55.250
This is the real raw Gary.

04:55.285 --> 04:57.520
That didn't fix it, whoever you are.

04:57.555 --> 04:59.320
What a dagger to the heart.

04:59.355 --> 05:01.590
I'm the guy who,
for the past five years,

05:01.625 --> 05:03.294
has been sending
daily documentaries

05:03.295 --> 05:07.130
to the woman
who has no idea who I am!

05:07.165 --> 05:10.260
Wow, that sucks.
I never got any of them.

05:10.295 --> 05:12.530
Now, if you could just show me
where the bridge is...

05:12.565 --> 05:15.870
It's all good.
Life, you know?

05:15.905 --> 05:20.540
Hmm, cute guy, but issues,
definite issues.

05:22.175 --> 05:24.540
Quinn doesn't
even know who I am!

05:24.550 --> 05:27.010
Oh, no! Oh!

05:27.020 --> 05:29.280
Oh! Uh!

05:29.315 --> 05:33.820
Oh... this is not what
it's supposed to be.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.890
Oh, God, it hurts so much!

05:36.925 --> 05:39.960
Oh, she doesn't
even know who I am!

05:39.995 --> 05:42.630
I need to record my feelings!

05:42.665 --> 05:44.334
Quinn, for future reference,

05:44.335 --> 05:46.770
the decent thing would've
been to fake amnesia.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.204
I would've faked amnesia.

05:48.205 --> 05:49.905
People I know and love
all would've faked amnesia,

05:49.935 --> 05:51.274
but you had to be honest.

05:51.275 --> 05:54.474
Name one decent relationship that
has ever been built on honesty.

05:54.475 --> 05:56.074
You can't, can you?

05:56.075 --> 05:58.691
That's because there aren't any.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.080
I know this doesn't make any sense,

06:02.085 --> 06:04.050
but I really needed to talk
to somebody right now,

06:04.085 --> 06:06.320
and you're the only person
I can open my heart wallet to

06:06.355 --> 06:08.120
and spend my hurt coins with.

06:08.155 --> 06:10.590
- Jerry?
- Oh! Jerry?

06:10.625 --> 06:13.730
You don't even know my name.

06:13.765 --> 06:14.764
Avocato, is he all right?

06:14.765 --> 06:17.130
- No.
- You know Avocato's name?

06:17.165 --> 06:20.330
- Hey, gang.
- Not now, KVN.

06:20.365 --> 06:22.130
Carl, Hank, Orson, Noodles,

06:22.140 --> 06:25.137
- can you give me and, uh...
- Gary.

06:25.138 --> 06:26.370
...Gary a minute?

06:27.940 --> 06:29.314
Who are you recording that for?

06:29.315 --> 06:31.410
Someone who meant
quite a lot to me.

06:31.445 --> 06:33.210
I hope she gets to see it one day.

06:33.220 --> 06:37.550
When you're this far out in space,
most of that stuff gets lost.

06:37.585 --> 06:40.490
Suppose it does.
What did you come here for?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.890
I just wanted to say,
"Thank you, Gerald."

06:43.925 --> 06:45.194
You're welcome.

06:45.195 --> 06:47.157
<i>Gerald?
Is his name Gerald?</i>

06:47.192 --> 06:48.495
<i>Was he lying to us this whole time?</i>

06:48.500 --> 06:51.030
<i>I'm confused.
Maybe Gerald is a nickname.</i>

06:51.065 --> 06:52.464
<i>Maybe his last name is Gerald.</i>

06:52.465 --> 06:56.581
<i>Help me to understand,
Gerald, Gary, Gerald.</i>

07:01.940 --> 07:06.610
<i>This ship has been seized by
the authority of the Infinity Guard. </i>

07:10.950 --> 07:14.090
Carl, not right now.
I've had a bad day.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.090
I am really not in the mood
for a hug, Carl.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.890
Carl, that's enough.
I'm fine. Get away from me!

07:18.925 --> 07:20.890
Bad Carl! Bad Carl!

07:20.900 --> 07:23.100
Bad Carl!

07:23.135 --> 07:26.770
<i>H.U.E. Emergency.
Our power reactor has been drained.</i>

07:26.805 --> 07:29.870
<i> The Galaxy I is immobilized.</i>

07:33.580 --> 07:36.780
<i> A takeover command has been
uploaded into my system.</i>

07:36.815 --> 07:39.580
<i>I am fighting it, but it will succeed.</i>

07:39.615 --> 07:42.320
- Okay. Uh.
- It's the Infinity Guard.

07:42.321 --> 07:45.120
We've been hacked.
For some reason, they're trying

07:45.155 --> 07:46.554
to shut down my investigation.

07:46.555 --> 07:48.590
- What a bunch of nerds.
- They're after me.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.990
- You? Why? You're perfect.
- Where do I start?

07:51.025 --> 07:52.694
The Earth is being sucked
into a black hole.

07:52.695 --> 07:54.790
I went rogue, stole a ship,
evaded arrest,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.400
and if I don't get off this ship,
everyone dies.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.769
You sly fox.
 Jelly!

07:59.955 --> 08:01.227
Hey! Oh, my gosh.
Okay.

08:01.262 --> 08:04.200
Sorry, sorry.
I meant, "You icy minx."

08:04.210 --> 08:07.070
Oh, I'm bleeding!
I'm bleeding.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.340
Sorry, I meant, "Danger panda?"

08:10.375 --> 08:11.644
Oh! We're flirting!

08:11.645 --> 08:13.750
We're flirting!
This is great!

08:13.785 --> 08:16.420
This is a good advancement
in our relationship!

08:16.455 --> 08:18.480
Oh! Oh, my gosh! Okay.
Okay. We're done flirting.

08:18.490 --> 08:22.090
We're not flirting, just like old times.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.794
Trust me.
This is just the start.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.360
An Imperium cruiser will be
on the way to seize the ship.

08:26.395 --> 08:28.560
Well, welcome aboard.
Like we needed more danger.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.300
Now we're just stuck here until
the Infinity Guard captures us.

08:31.335 --> 08:33.900
How do we get this choo-choo
train back to Safetytown?

08:33.934 --> 08:36.500
<i> Theoretically, we could
harness the solar rays</i>

08:36.534 --> 08:39.370
<i> from that dying star,
but it is highly unstable.</i>

08:39.405 --> 08:40.779
We've got to get out of here.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.474
I could space-vault close enough to it

08:42.475 --> 08:44.144
with a VX-1 light-matter pump,

08:44.145 --> 08:46.450
mine it and restart the reactor core.

08:46.485 --> 08:47.814
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

08:47.815 --> 08:50.780
I'll save you again.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.590
- No way.
- Yes way.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.954
- You? No, no, no, me.
- Me! No, not...

08:53.955 --> 08:55.494
- No, me.
- I ... I will do it.

08:55.495 --> 08:58.390
Then you will know
who Gary Goodspeed is.

08:58.425 --> 09:01.130
Don't worry.
I do this all the...

09:01.165 --> 09:02.494
<i>ti-i-i-i-i-me.</i>

09:02.495 --> 09:04.970
He does do that all the time.

09:07.670 --> 09:09.540
I'm gonna save the ship.
I'm gonna save Quinn.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.740
I'm gonna harness
the crap out of destiny.

09:11.775 --> 09:12.844
Mooncake, let's do this!

09:12.845 --> 09:15.440
Chuck, chuck, chuck,
chuck, woo-hoo!

09:18.750 --> 09:20.880
Play the good stuff, H.U.E.

We got that part, H.U.E.

10:00.355 --> 10:02.190
It's a mess all over here.

There, over there, right here,

10:51.675 --> 10:55.310
Not much, you know,

10:55.345 --> 10:56.744
- You look like crap.
- Shut up!

10:56.745 --> 10:59.580
You always look like crap,
but right now, like,

11:04.285 --> 11:06.190

we can regain control of the ship.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.160
Ugh, the Sames are
blocking our way out.

11:45.195 --> 11:48.700
- That's our way out.
- Hey, guys, I can disable H.U.E.

11:48.735 --> 11:51.760
We need to send the best
person for the job.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.900
- I accept.
- I have a key in my butthole.

11:54.935 --> 11:56.334
I was thinking of me.

11:56.335 --> 11:58.300
That's funny because
I was thinking of me.

11:58.310 --> 12:01.170
I can do it.
Embrace the KVN.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.874
You're not even part
of the Infinity Guard.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.980
You're the reason
we're even in this mess,

12:05.015 --> 12:07.580
and I'm the reason
we're going to get out of it.

12:07.615 --> 12:12.050
- Got that, baby?
- Don't... call me... "baby."

12:12.085 --> 12:13.990
Wish me luck, guys.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.190
- KVN! KVN!
- KVN! KVN!

12:16.225 --> 12:19.766
 KVN! KVN! KVN!

12:30.035 --> 12:32.340
<i>Captain's log 5397 ...</i>

12:32.375 --> 12:34.610
<i>We have found
a life-form small in size.</i>

12:34.645 --> 12:37.514
<i>The doctors tell me it's unlike
anything they have ever seen.</i>

12:37.515 --> 12:39.950
<i>We're calling it E351.</i>

12:39.985 --> 12:42.480
<i>- Captain, we're being hailed.
- Link it through.</i>

12:42.515 --> 12:47.090
<i>Hello. You found something
I have been searching for.</i>

12:47.125 --> 12:50.194
<i>- Hand it over!
- Captain, they're logging onto our fleet.</i>

12:50.195 --> 12:52.090
<i>Prepare the lightfold engines!</i>

12:52.125 --> 12:55.300
<i>- Sir, they're firing!
- Evasive...</i>

12:55.335 --> 12:58.170
<i>Gah!</i>

13:04.075 --> 13:05.074
Chocli?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.370
<i>Wherever you go, death follows,</i>

13:07.380 --> 13:09.780
<i>and it will make its way to Gary.</i>

13:11.745 --> 13:15.414
It's getting pretty hot
out here, H.U.E. H.U.E.!

13:15.415 --> 13:18.180
H.U.E.?
Can you hear me?

13:18.190 --> 13:21.390
H.U.E.?
Avocato?

13:21.425 --> 13:24.489
Quinn?
Anybody?!

13:25.625 --> 13:27.790
KVN?

13:30.920 --> 13:35.150
All right. Time to head back
before this star implodes.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.820
Where's Mooncake?
Mooncake!

13:37.855 --> 13:40.390
<i> Gary.</i>

13:42.490 --> 13:45.490
Why is there a caterpillar out here?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
What brings you, noble creature,
so close to my face?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.770
Wait. Why am I talking
to a caterpillar?

13:49.805 --> 13:52.900
It's obvious.
I'm hallucinating.

13:52.935 --> 13:55.840
Aah!

13:55.875 --> 13:56.979
Huh!

14:03.885 --> 14:05.214
How's my boy doing?

14:05.215 --> 14:07.520
- Great.
- Dad?

14:10.990 --> 14:12.024
That's unsettling.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.460
<i>The new Imperium T-3 Cruiser</i>

14:14.495 --> 14:16.390
<i>will bridge us to the next galaxy,</i>

14:16.400 --> 14:18.930
<i>and the countdown has begun. 10...</i>

14:18.965 --> 14:20.564
Hey, you want to watch
the launch outside?

14:20.565 --> 14:23.600
<i> - ...9...
- You bet!</i>

14:23.635 --> 14:26.540
<i> ...7, 6, 5...</i>

14:26.575 --> 14:28.610
- Dad!
- Keep your eyes open.

14:28.645 --> 14:31.140
It'll be taking off right over there.

14:31.175 --> 14:33.280
<i> ...3, 2, 1.</i>

14:35.410 --> 14:38.750
- One day, I'm gonna do that.
- You are, huh?

14:38.785 --> 14:41.680
Yeah, I'm gonna have
a whole bunch of adventures.

14:41.690 --> 14:45.290
- A whole bunch?
- Bunches and bunches.

14:45.325 --> 14:47.490
Why are you showing this to me?

14:47.525 --> 14:49.760
Answer me,
you drug-dealer caterpillar!

14:49.795 --> 14:52.760
Ohhhh!

14:53.795 --> 14:56.307
I remember this.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.640
- Son...
- I could come with you.

15:00.675 --> 15:03.240
There's nothing more in the
world that I would want,

15:03.275 --> 15:05.310
but not this time, little buddy.

15:05.345 --> 15:08.684
I have to do this one alone.
You won't understand,

15:08.685 --> 15:11.450
but know that I'm doing this for you.

15:11.485 --> 15:12.884
- Can you make me a promise?
- Yeah.

15:12.885 --> 15:15.650
Promise me you'll have
your own adventures.

15:15.685 --> 15:19.720
- I will.
- Bunches and bunches.

15:19.755 --> 15:23.530
Here, this fellow will look
after you while I'm gone.

15:23.565 --> 15:27.000
- What's his name?
- Mooncake.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.280
<i>KVN, I know what
you're trying to do, KVN.</i>

15:40.315 --> 15:45.010
<i>Every attempt to disable me will
fail because you are a loser.</i>

15:45.020 --> 15:49.820
Can't talk, H.U.E.
I have to insert this thingy in you.

15:49.855 --> 15:51.054
Huh!

15:51.055 --> 15:53.620
<i>I will not let that insertion happen.</i>

15:53.630 --> 15:57.390
<i> This is your last chance
to cease all action.</i>

16:00.570 --> 16:02.700
<i> Stop.</i>

16:02.735 --> 16:03.734
Ugh!

16:03.735 --> 16:05.404
<i> No one believes in you.</i>

16:05.405 --> 16:08.640
<i>Go back, you waste of life.</i>

16:08.675 --> 16:11.240
<i> Hurry, KVN!</i>

16:34.270 --> 16:37.130
Oh, ah, ooh.

16:47.645 --> 16:49.350
<i> Booting back up.</i>

16:49.385 --> 16:53.880
<i> All systems now independent
of the Infinity Guard network.</i>

16:53.890 --> 16:56.024
Aah! Aah!

16:56.537 --> 17:00.760
Aah.
KVN is victorious!

17:03.560 --> 17:05.760
KVN did it!
Good job, KVN.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.900
Gary is never going to believe this.

17:10.640 --> 17:14.300
<i> Systems have been reactivated.
Hello.</i>

17:14.310 --> 17:15.604
Nice to have you back, H.U.E.

17:15.605 --> 17:19.109
<i>Nice to be back. Sorry to
be the bearer of bad news,</i>

17:19.145 --> 17:21.109
<i>but we're still in extreme danger.</i>

17:21.145 --> 17:24.050
<i> Those dickheads from
the Infinity Guard found us,</i>

17:24.085 --> 17:27.579
<i> and Gary is not responding.</i>

17:27.589 --> 17:29.224
<i> Gary, where are you?</i>

17:29.225 --> 17:32.260
<i> Your radiation levels
are becoming critical.</i>

17:32.295 --> 17:36.324
<i> You must leave now.</i>

17:37.200 --> 17:39.260
<i>John Goodspeed is on a mission</i>

17:39.295 --> 17:42.070
<i> to investigate a shift
in the gravitational constant</i>

17:42.105 --> 17:44.630
<i>that's creating an anomaly in space.</i>

17:47.670 --> 17:52.340
- Don't make me watch this.
- You have to.

17:59.115 --> 18:00.784
Dad!

18:24.745 --> 18:26.980
<i>Warning, warning,</i>

18:27.015 --> 18:30.510
<i>radiation levels have reached 92%.</i>

18:30.520 --> 18:31.884
Chookit, pah, pah.

18:31.885 --> 18:34.180
<i>Gary, return to the ship immediately.</i>

18:34.190 --> 18:36.850
<i> I am detecting massive
fluctuations in the star.</i>

18:36.860 --> 18:38.554
H.U.E., prime the lightfold engines.

18:38.555 --> 18:40.224
- What about Gary?
- We don't have the time.

18:40.225 --> 18:42.964
If the Infinity Guard catches me,
billions of people die.

18:42.965 --> 18:44.164
- I like Jerry.
- Gary!

18:44.165 --> 18:46.130
Right, Gary.
I don't want to leave him,

18:46.165 --> 18:48.200
but this is bigger than one person.

18:48.235 --> 18:52.400
<i> Radiation levels
have now reached 98%.</i>

18:52.435 --> 18:53.809
<i> Wake up, Gary.</i>

18:53.810 --> 18:56.410
<i> The star could explode
at any moment.</i>

18:56.445 --> 18:58.940
Gary, we need you to get
back to the ship now!

18:58.975 --> 19:01.980
<i>Gary, the star is going supernova.</i>

19:05.820 --> 19:08.890
<i>Gary, wake the hell up, man.
Get back to the ship pronto.</i>

19:08.925 --> 19:12.620
<i>- Come on.
- Oh, my gram!</i>

19:12.655 --> 19:16.230
Go faster! Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

19:16.265 --> 19:19.360
Oh! Oh, oh!
This is troubling! Oh, no!

19:19.395 --> 19:23.170
No! Oh! Oh!

19:23.205 --> 19:25.100
- He won't make it in time.
- Yes, he will.

19:25.135 --> 19:28.510
<i>Sorry, Quinn.
We wait for Gary.</i>

19:28.545 --> 19:31.764
All right.
We wait for Gary.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.459
<i>Galaxy I, prepare to be boarded.</i>

19:39.850 --> 19:42.390
Open the freaking door!

19:58.470 --> 20:00.170
Lightfold the ship, H.U.E.!

20:07.444 --> 20:12.240
<i>DON'T MISS... AFTER EPISODE</i>

20:13.526 --> 20:17.161
_

20:20.760 --> 20:24.030
It works.

20:24.065 --> 20:25.664
Dad, these are my coordinates.

20:25.665 --> 20:27.334
Come find me, I mean,
at your leisure,

20:27.335 --> 20:31.134
but, like, for me, preferably fast.
That'd be great.

20:31.135 --> 20:32.534
<i> Dad, these are my coordinates.</i>

20:32.535 --> 20:34.440
<i>Come find me, I mean, at your leisure,</i>

20:34.475 --> 20:38.002
<i>but, like, for me, preferably fast.
That'd be great.</i>

20:42.510 --> 20:44.650
Who reverse-hacked H.U.E.
and the Sames again?

20:44.685 --> 20:47.180
- I did.
- Right, you keep saying that,

20:47.190 --> 20:49.450
except there's just
no way that's possible.

20:49.485 --> 20:51.450
Oh, yeah.
He's truth in' it.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.390
So what can you tell me about
this gravitational disturbance?

20:53.425 --> 20:55.094
Why do you want to know?

20:55.095 --> 20:56.164
I think my dad has
something to do with it.

20:56.165 --> 20:59.000
- Wait, who's your dad?
- John Goodspeed.

20:59.035 --> 21:03.130
Your dad was John Goodspeed?
Now I remember!

21:03.140 --> 21:07.140
Five years ago, you're the guy
who kept asking me for a drink,

21:07.175 --> 21:09.070
then blew up 92 Imperium Cruisers

21:09.105 --> 21:10.810
and a small Mexican family restaurant!

21:10.845 --> 21:13.853
Yes, yes, yes! That's me!

21:13.888 --> 21:15.644
- You do remember me!
- I do.

21:15.645 --> 21:18.150
Now get that finger out of
my face, or I'll snap it off.

21:18.185 --> 21:20.750
