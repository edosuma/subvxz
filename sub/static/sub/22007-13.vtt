00:01.802 --> 00:06.707
JEFF: Previously on
"survivor," Ben's alliance was

00:06.740 --> 00:08.109
turning against him.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.477
Ben's got to go.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.314
I heard my name, so I got to
do whatever I have to do to keep

00:13.347 --> 00:16.484
myself in this game.

00:16.517 --> 00:20.121
JEFF: At tribal council,
Ben made his target clear.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.156
You know what I'm doing
tonight?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.657
I'm writing her name down.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.992
I'll say it.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.761
JEFF: Causing complete
chaos.

00:27.795 --> 00:32.366
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
Wow.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.069
In the end everyone voted for
Ben, but it didn't matter.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.971
I'm going to play this for
myself.

00:38.005 --> 00:41.975
This is a hidden immunity idol.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.578
JEFF: Ben sent Lauren to
the jury.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.114
Lauren, the tribe has spoken.

00:46.147 --> 00:46.947
Six are left.

00:46.980 --> 00:56.990
Who will be voted out tonight?

00:57.024 --> 01:04.063
Who will be voted out tonight?

01:06.134 --> 01:06.900
Wow.

01:06.934 --> 01:12.773
What a crazy freaking tribal
council.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.741
Wow.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.144
That may have been better
than my idol play.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.611
I am so excited.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.247
I can't believe that just
happened.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.950
The only way I felt I could stay
in the game is to turn everyone

01:22.983 --> 01:25.786
on me and paint a target on
myself and then use the ID.L.

01:25.819 --> 01:26.487
And gets Lauren out.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.256
That's how you play an idol.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.991
No hard feelings, y'all.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.593
No hard feelings.

01:32.626 --> 01:36.997
Seeing six votes for yourself,
and you pulling off the only

01:37.030 --> 01:40.868
vote, getting to choose solely
on who gets to go home, I mean,

01:40.901 --> 01:43.103
that's a good feeling.

01:43.137 --> 01:43.871
Does anyone need water.

01:43.904 --> 01:44.972
No thanks.

01:45.005 --> 01:45.773
Okay.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.308
I'm going to go water.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.676
All right.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.544
Well, we all know who has to go
next.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.546
Oh, my gosh.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.884
Can we just decide have that
set.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.452
Did you know he had that?

01:58.486 --> 01:59.019
No.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.087
Nobody knew it?

02:00.120 --> 02:00.921
Nobody knew.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.424
We all wrote his name down.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.626
Why would we write his name
down...

02:05.659 --> 02:08.862
So listen, can we all decide,
he's going home next, no matter

02:08.895 --> 02:09.297
what.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.464
He's amazing.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.633
How do we not?

02:12.666 --> 02:13.834
He's really amazing.

02:13.867 --> 02:19.440
Coming back the camp after
tribal, I felt like, if there

02:19.473 --> 02:21.875
are "survivor" gods, that was a
move by the "survivor" devil.

02:21.909 --> 02:22.876
That was messed up.

02:22.910 --> 02:27.147
I didn't want to see Lauren go
home at all.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.116
I had no clue he had an idol.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.784
I had no clue.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.652
I was floored.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.920
The guy's amazing.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.356
Which is why he has to go
home.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.357
Can we all agree?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.625
No argument here.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.226
Here's the thing.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.593
One of us must win...

02:39.627 --> 02:42.330
Because if any of us goes
against him...

02:42.363 --> 02:43.030
No, it's done.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.165
One of us must win immunity.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.569
Ben is still everyone's
number-one target, but this game

02:48.602 --> 02:50.671
is never as simple as you want
it to be.

02:50.704 --> 02:54.141
As soon as I think, oh, I have
this perfect plan, it's going to

02:54.174 --> 02:59.079
be so easy, that's when things
just turn upside down and

02:59.112 --> 03:01.915
everything goes the opposite way
and you have to devise this

03:01.949 --> 03:04.452
whole new plan and start over.

03:04.485 --> 03:09.056
We're going to get him.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.360
Voted out the wrong person,
Ben.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.596
What do you mean in
you should have voted me out.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.332
Because I ain't going to let
you win immunity.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.333
I'm telling you right now.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.534
All right.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.304
I got Devon who is calling me
out, and everybody is painting

03:23.337 --> 03:28.376
me the bad guy, and, you know, I
have no alliance anymore.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.009
Final six.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.811
Final six, guys.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.779
Congrats.

03:31.812 --> 03:41.822
So I got a long, hard road
ahead of me now.

03:41.855 --> 03:51.899
So I got a long, hard road
ahead of me now.

03:51.899 --> 04:01.909
So I got a long, hard road
ahead of me now.

04:01.942 --> 04:11.985
So I got a long, hard road
ahead of me now.

04:11.985 --> 04:19.059
So I got a long, hard road
ahead of me now.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.596
Traditionally in "survivor,"
once an idol is played, it gets

04:22.630 --> 04:25.499
introduced back into the game,
so I get up this morning, and

04:25.533 --> 04:30.070
the fire is not going, and so I
make a fire and kind of look

04:30.103 --> 04:37.010
around, and everybody is still
sleeping.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.514
There's not much wood, so I'm
going to start looking for an

04:40.548 --> 04:51.525
idol while I gather wood, you
know?

04:51.559 --> 04:53.427
Idols are not easy the find at
all.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.697
These forests and these jungles
and these islands are huge, but

04:56.730 --> 05:00.100
the last time I found one there
was a rock that said dig on it.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.503
So I'm looking for something
like that.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.072
I'm looking in trees, looking at
rocks.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.374
I'm looking on the ground.

05:06.407 --> 05:10.310
I'm looking everywhere.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.980
So when I woke up this
morning, Ben is gone.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.350
An I'm a little nervous because
Ben is obviously looking for an

05:16.384 --> 05:18.486
idol.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.355
But everyone now wants Ben out
of the game.

05:21.389 --> 05:24.658
So to keep me safe for one more
tribal, I am banking on the fact

05:24.692 --> 05:27.661
that Ben will not find an idol
again.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.364
I think he's already off looking
for an idol.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.400
He's been gone about, I don't
know, 45 minutes.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.370
Uh-huh.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.906
My any time is dwindling
here.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.474
And I know that.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.743
And I accept that fate.

05:42.776 --> 05:47.114
So I need the find an idol or
win immunity to keep me in the

05:47.147 --> 06:01.094
game, because I ain't going to
quit until I'm out.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.364
Captioning funded by CBS
and Ford.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.767
We go further, so you can.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.937
( THEME SONG PLAYING )

06:17.144 --> 06:19.813
*

06:24.818 --> 06:35.863
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.399
Shall we get to today's reward
challenge?

06:39.433 --> 06:40.434
Yeah.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.636
JEFF: For today's
challenge, you're going to be

06:42.670 --> 06:43.971
divided into pairs.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.340
Each pair will be attached to a
rope that is woven through a

06:47.374 --> 06:50.978
series of obstacles.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.582
On my go, you'll race through
the obstacles to the finish,

06:54.615 --> 07:00.854
where you will attempt to land
five rings on a target.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.956
First pair to finish wins
reward.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.558
Want to know what you're playing
for?

07:04.592 --> 07:05.793
Yeah.

07:05.826 --> 07:10.063
JEFF: The winning pair will
be taken by chopper to a private

07:10.097 --> 07:16.236
resort on a private island where
you'll enjoy lamb, chicken,

07:16.269 --> 07:19.840
lobster, cocktails, chocolate
mousse.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.974
Oh.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.143
JEFF: And then you will
spend the night and sleep in a

07:23.176 --> 07:23.443
bed.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.612
Whoa.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.713
Oh, my god.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.549
JEFF: We'll do a random
draw for pairs and we'll get

07:28.582 --> 07:28.849
going.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.017
Wow.

07:30.050 --> 07:37.625
JEFF: Get it on.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.193
All right
we randomly divided into three

07:40.227 --> 07:41.394
pairs.

07:41.428 --> 07:45.899
It is Ben with Ashley, Chrissy
with Devon, and Ryan and Mike.

07:45.933 --> 07:51.104
Here we go for a nice reward.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.006
Survivors ready?

07:53.040 --> 07:56.243
Go!

07:56.276 --> 08:01.181
First you're going to launch
your body over and under wood

08:01.214 --> 08:02.616
while tethered to a rope.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.684
Ashley is over first.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.451
There goes Mike.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.953
We're tied up.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.888
We're tied up.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.224
JEFF: Mike and Ryan trying
to coordinate that rope

08:11.258 --> 08:11.792
management.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.494
Here comes Chrissy.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.664
Chrissy already hung up in the
rope.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.532
Devon having to help her.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.802
Ashley with a big lead.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
There goes Ben.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.737
People throwing themselves over.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.639
We are pretty even right now.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.809
Ashley and Ben with a bit of a
lead.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.679
Chrissy and Devon right on their
daily.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.681
Mike, Mike, hold on!

08:33.714 --> 08:35.182
Okay.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.083
You have to come back.

08:37.116 --> 08:37.684
Why?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.119
Because it's too tight.

08:39.152 --> 08:42.722
JEFF: Ryan and Mike now
with a problem.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.756
Ashley with a nice move.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.093
It is Ashley first out.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.294
Ben right behind.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.396
Ashley and Ben have the early
lead.

08:49.429 --> 08:53.033
Moving on to the second phase,
you got to follow that rope

08:53.066 --> 08:54.602
wherever it goes, you go.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.870
Go under, under, under.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.439
JEFF: Ashley is working
through the obstacle quickry.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.407
No problem.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.110
Here comes Chrissy and Devon now
right behind.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.612
I can't move.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.716
No Mike and Ryan stuck trying to
figure out what's wrong.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.183
You got to go over again.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.419
DREW: They are falling out of
this reward challenge early.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.623
It is now Chrissy and Devon on
this second stage.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.226
34 days in, everybody running
out of energy.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.460
Ashley is through the second
stage.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.196
Ben is through the second stage.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.598
They're moving on to the third
stage now.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.166
Under?

09:26.199 --> 09:27.300
Under.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.703
JEFF: It is Chrissy and
Devon trying to catch Ben and

09:29.737 --> 09:32.072
Ashley.

09:32.105 --> 09:36.443
Mike and Ryan finally through
that first section.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.245
Chrissy and Devon now in the
third section.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.148
Mike and Ryan have got to pick
up the pace.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.083
You're still in it, guys.

09:43.116 --> 09:48.221
Lamb, chicken, lobster, sleep in
a bed, private island.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.591
This could be a big boost for
that next immunity challenge.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.826
Come on, Ryan.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.994
We're good.

09:54.027 --> 09:58.231
JEFF: Mike and Ryan quickly
through that second section.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.500
Chris yes and Devon making up
some time now.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.669
Keep going.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.071
JEFF: Once you figure out
how to work that rope, you can

10:04.104 --> 10:05.005
get a rhythm going.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.106
Keep going.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.641
No Ben and Ashley all tangled
up.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.476
Don't get tangled.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.477
Perfect, perfect.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.345
JEFF: Mike and Ryan now
picking up some time.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.580
They're back in this.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.650
We are dead even now between Ben
and Ashley, Chrissy and Devon.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.851
Right behind you.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.420
JEFF: It is Chrissy
finishing first.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.622
But she can't do anything until
Devon gets there.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.924
Come on, Devon.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.060
DREW: Ashley and Ben are
through.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.796
You guys are good on clips.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.798
Ben and Ashley moving on to the
final stage.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.598
Start untying.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.433
You got it noosm Devon is
through.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.367
You're good.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.135
Unclip.

10:35.168 --> 10:39.406
Mike and Ryan right on their
tail.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.241
Ben has his rings free.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.076
Ben going to toss.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.144
Just misses.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.347
Five rings now, Ben and Ashley
looking to hook them.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.383
Devon now has his rings free.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.685
He tosses and just misses.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.620
Let's go!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.889
JEFF: Unclip.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.790
Mike, you're good.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.791
Ryan you're good.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.126
Devon, two hands and scores.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.794
Def within first ring.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.862
Ben misses.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.063
We're right in this.

11:03.096 --> 11:06.700
JEFF: It comes down to a
backyard game of ring toss for a

11:06.734 --> 11:09.436
huge reward 34 days into
"survivor."

11:09.469 --> 11:11.538
Go ahead.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.040
JEFF: Mike scores his first
one.

11:13.073 --> 11:17.110
It would be a huge comeback for
Mike and Ryan.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.779
Devon has the second for yellow.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.849
Blue with one.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.752
Red looking to get on the board
and they do with that shot.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.986
Red now has one.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.255
Ben with a second.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.023
Ben scores the third for red.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.258
Ben is on a roll.

11:31.291 --> 11:36.296
Red now in the lead with three.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.497
Devon scores a third for yellow.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.534
We are tied three for red, three
for yellow.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.470
Ryan's going to give it a shot.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.371
Blue scores again.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.208
Blue now at two for Ryan and
Mike.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.977
Devon and Chrissy with three.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.411
Make it four for yellow.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.581
Def within the last ring could
win it.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.682
No.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.984
Come on, Ben.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.851
You got this.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.921
JEFF: Ben trying the keep
them in it.

12:00.954 --> 12:01.421
No.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.191
Won't fall.

12:04.224 --> 12:09.262
Devon for the win... and he does
it!

12:09.296 --> 12:14.467
Devon and Chrissy win reward.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.771
Chopper ride the a private
resorten a private island.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.672
Nice feast and a good night's
sleep.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.408
Good job, guys.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.943
Good job, guys.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.846
JEFF: Devon and Chrissy,
come on over.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.115
[APPLAUSE]
Good job to, guys.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.416
Good job, y'all.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.617
JEFF: Here's the deal.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.286
Chopper will pick you up, take
you the a beautiful private

12:33.320 --> 12:36.256
resorten a private island, and
the make it interesting, because

12:36.289 --> 12:41.128
it's "survivor," there are four
people left, choose one and only

12:41.161 --> 12:45.298
one person to join you.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.235
Can we discuss this?

12:48.268 --> 12:52.873
I think that Ryan would be
the best choice?

12:52.906 --> 12:53.540
No all right.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.274
You conferred.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.275
You made your decision.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.645
Who will join you on the reward?

12:58.678 --> 13:03.583
It's going to be Ryan.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.218
JEFF: Ryan, come on over.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.721
Thank you guys so much.

13:08.755 --> 13:09.923
You're welcome.

13:09.957 --> 13:17.330
Thank you.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.167
JEFF: Ashley, you are
looking like, wow, this is a

13:20.200 --> 13:21.401
shocking decision.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.171
Shocking for one of them, not
so shocking for the other, so

13:24.204 --> 13:25.772
it's interesting who makes the
decisions.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.974
I don't know.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.910
I guess you always hold on to
that hope that maybe alliances

13:29.943 --> 13:32.612
will pull through, but there is
always other reasons for

13:32.645 --> 13:34.281
people's decisions.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.284
JEFF: Devon, Chrissy, Ryan,
nice award awaits you.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.020
Could be a huge advantage
heading into that next immunity

13:40.053 --> 13:40.888
challenge.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.824
Grab you stuff, head back to
camp, enjoy.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.393
Chopper will pick you up.

13:46.426 --> 13:52.665
JEFF: Ashley, you are still in
I wanted to go on this reward

13:52.699 --> 13:57.437
to look for a clue to a hidden
immunity idol, but Ashley is all

13:57.470 --> 13:58.939
hangry, which is perfect for me.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.909
That's going to be the only way
I start stirring stuff up.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:17.390 --> 14:22.896
Oh, no.

14:22.930 --> 14:28.101
What did you say?

14:28.135 --> 14:31.304
That's a tough one to lose.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.805
Yeah.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.207
Overnight.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.244
I mean, why don't we all just
vent for five minutes.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.345
I was so pissed losing this
challenge.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.983
I don't know why Devon and
Chrissy didn't take me over

14:43.016 --> 14:44.251
Ryan.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.554
You would think that because I'm
in the middle I would be needed,

14:47.587 --> 14:56.029
unless Devon is trying to flip
Ryan back to him, it's very fair

14:56.063 --> 15:02.002
to think Devon could be the
decideing factor.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.703
Ryan is the least deserving.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.872
That's youngest person, he has
the most energy.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.107
He's 22 years old.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.109
I've been on the team with the
kid twice now.

15:09.142 --> 15:14.114
The kid can't even keep a rope
and a knot straight.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.482
Like so frustrated.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.716
Yep.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.519
These two are walking around
like a bunch of crying babies.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.189
They're hungry and tired and am
I going the try the use that to

15:22.222 --> 15:23.423
my advantage?

15:23.456 --> 15:26.126
Well, yeah, I mean, that's the
only thing I got at this point.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.528
So where are your minds at
then.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
Who would go next?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.631
Besides you?

15:31.664 --> 15:32.332
Ryan.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.667
Are you gunning for me, doc?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.369
Am I next out regardless?

15:36.403 --> 15:39.372
Honestly, I think you're one
of the biggest threats in your

15:39.406 --> 15:40.540
game.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.510
All you do is throw me under
the bus all day every day.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.345
Isn't that what you would
expect?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.479
No, no.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.216
I would think it's safe to
say everyone wants you out

15:49.249 --> 15:50.383
before the three.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.920
Well, if you can use my vote
for something, let me know

15:53.953 --> 15:55.155
because I don't want to go next.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.556
Mike wants me gone.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.258
He's going to be my next target.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.428
I'm hoping I'm going to be able
to work with ash, but I got a

16:01.461 --> 16:10.937
lot of work to do to keep my
butt in this game.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.106
I don't trust doc at all.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
He's playing with you and Devon
right now.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.575
I know.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.544
I know right where doc is at.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.447
But I also know right where
you're at.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.283
Where am I at?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.653
You feel like you're at the
bottom, and you're trying the

16:26.686 --> 16:27.454
play who you.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.289
Can
well, they're gunning for you

16:29.322 --> 16:31.324
and Devon
who is?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.659
Chrissy and Ryan.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.995
They're gunning for me and
Devon according to you.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.566
At this point Ben is saying that
Devon and I don't have an upper

16:39.599 --> 16:43.970
hand anymore, and I think that's
true to a very large extent, but

16:44.003 --> 16:46.873
coming from Ben, I have to think
about it like he's probably just

16:46.906 --> 16:49.042
saying that to just to save
himself.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.943
Oh, Ashley.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.412
You just make me laugh.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.613
Why's that?

16:53.646 --> 16:56.316
Because you basically told me
there is nothing I can do to

16:56.349 --> 16:57.350
talk to you then.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.585
Right.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.453
I don't get far with Ashley
trying the patch everything over

17:00.487 --> 17:03.390
with her is like talking to a
brick wall.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.425
So I'm going to keep looking and
trying to find this dang idol.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.096
I'm going to go get water.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.598
Well, I know Ben is going to
be looking for the hidden

17:11.631 --> 17:13.900
immunity idol, but I searched
the beach.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.467
I've searched the woods.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.435
I've searched the path.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.970
And I can't find the idol
anywhere.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.473
So I'm not worried about Ben
searching for the idol.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.474
There is no reason to keep
following him around.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.444
Ben is not going the find
another idol twice in a row as

17:25.478 --> 17:28.448
long as he doesn't win immunity,
which he's never done.

17:28.481 --> 17:41.661
I feel pretty confident Ben's
going home.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.229
Wow.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.396
Oh, my gosh.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.098
Look at that.

17:45.132 --> 17:45.598
Oh.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.599
Look at the view.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.500
Oh, wow.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.768
Is that a mudslide?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.703
That is mousse.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.838
That's chocolate mousse.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.273
There's fruit, there's bread.

17:53.306 --> 17:53.873
There's everything.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.475
I could not be happier.

17:55.508 --> 18:00.147
I didn't think that it could get
any better after I saw my dad.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.616
I love my dad, but coming to
this private island, all you can

18:03.650 --> 18:06.253
eat, all you can drink, and I
didn't even win.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.520
They took me.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.158
It's without question one of the
best moments of my entire life.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.126
So, guys...

18:13.160 --> 18:13.660
Strategy?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.861
Yeah.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.163
You guys down?

18:16.196 --> 18:18.331
I think Ben, number-one target.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.600
We have the get Ben out next.

18:20.633 --> 18:24.137
- Longer that guy is in the game,
the longer he could find an

18:24.171 --> 18:25.104
idol.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.806
And then Mike, I don't know who
he is playing.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.441
He could be playing me or he
could be playing you.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.277
I think we're underestimating
him.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.178
He's dangerous.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.313
And he's pissed nobody off.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.316
I think the three of us,
because we play such different

18:36.349 --> 18:38.951
games, I would be willing to go
to the final three with you.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.053
Wow.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.224
In the become of my head, I was
thinking about working with you

18:44.257 --> 18:45.458
and Ryan.

18:45.492 --> 18:50.129
Chrissy brought up the idea
of us three starting an alliance

18:50.163 --> 18:52.499
and going to the final three
together.

18:52.532 --> 18:56.769
Ryan was my closest ally, and
then he was my number-one enemy,

18:56.803 --> 19:01.007
but regardless of how unaligned
we've been over the past few

19:01.040 --> 19:04.311
votes, I feel like this is the
perfect time to make a move, so

19:04.344 --> 19:07.914
I'm going with who I think I
have the best shot of going to

19:07.947 --> 19:11.284
the final three with and who I
think I can beat in the end.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.454
I would love to work with
you, and I would love to go to

19:14.487 --> 19:17.224
the end with Ryan after
everything that's happened,

19:17.257 --> 19:17.724
like...

19:17.757 --> 19:18.791
It would be cool.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.227
Because we did tart this game
together on day one.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.863
The relationship that Devon
and I had was up and down, but

19:23.896 --> 19:27.534
in the grand scheme of things,
I'm closest with Devon and

19:27.567 --> 19:30.603
Chrissy, and I would love to go
to the final three with Beth

19:30.637 --> 19:31.804
those people.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.507
I think this is the perfect
three, and I really do believe

19:34.541 --> 19:36.008
that everything happens for a
reason.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.645
I just want the make it to the
final three, and may the best

19:38.678 --> 19:39.946
player at that point win.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.182
Although I don't know him
well, having Devon on the final

19:43.216 --> 19:47.153
three with me allows me the
break up the Ashley-Devon

19:47.186 --> 19:48.054
alliance.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.856
Oh, my gosh, you guy, it's so
gorgeous.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.458
Wow.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.794
Ashley was calling me out in
front of our tribe, so if Ashley

19:54.827 --> 19:56.863
wants me out, then I want her
out.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.297
Final three.

19:57.330 --> 19:57.830
Final three.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.598
Final three.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.699
Cheers.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.135
On the other hand, Ben is a
big threat, but he's not

20:03.169 --> 20:06.406
attached to anyone, whereas
Ashley right now has better

20:06.439 --> 20:07.607
relationships.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.944
So for my game, what may make
more sense to vote off Ashley

20:11.978 --> 20:14.847
first and then Ben next.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.883
Right now I don't know which way
is best to go.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.805
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

20:48.815 --> 20:49.649
All right.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.751
Let's get to today's immunity
challenge.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.753
First things first, Ashley, you
know the drill.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.187
You can take it from me.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.255
JEFF: I can take it from
you.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.624
You can win it back.

20:57.657 --> 21:02.462
That's right.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.565
JEFF: Once again immonti is
back up for grabs.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.801
For today's challenge you're
going the race through a series

21:08.835 --> 21:11.738
of obstacles to a sack of
sandbags.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.675
You'lls to as bag into a basket,
releasing a set of ladder rungs.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.545
You'll climb up, use the ball to
release another set of ladder

21:18.578 --> 21:19.612
rungs.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.515
When you get to the top, you'll
solve a cog puzzle.

21:22.549 --> 21:26.786
First person to spin their cog
puzzle raising their flag wins

21:26.819 --> 21:31.858
immunity guaranteed a one in
five shot at getting to the end.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.894
Losers, somebody will be voted
out tonight and become the sixth

21:34.927 --> 21:36.195
member of our jury.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.297
Big stakes on day 36.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.399
We'll draw for spots.

21:39.432 --> 21:46.839
We'll get started.

21:46.873 --> 21:47.474
All right.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.376
Here we go.

21:49.409 --> 21:53.446
For immunity and a guaranteed
spot in the final five,

21:53.480 --> 21:58.150
"survivor"... survivors ready?

21:58.184 --> 21:58.951
Go!

21:58.985 --> 22:03.356
You got to get up that ladder
first.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.991
Then it's down the net.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.459
Ben is over.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.427
Devon.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.696
Big fall by Devon.

22:09.729 --> 22:10.930
Ben head-first through.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.799
Devon head-first.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.636
Everybody playing "survivor" on
day 36.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.472
Everybody wants this.

22:19.506 --> 22:23.342
Now you're untying knots looking
for the sandbags.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.645
Whip through those knots.

22:25.678 --> 22:29.749
It is Chrissy bringing up the
rear, but she's still in it.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.452
Once you have your sangtd bags
out, start throwing them.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.387
You just need one bag in that
basket.

22:34.421 --> 22:37.023
Devon tossingen Ben tossing.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.259
Mike tosses.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.193
There it is.

22:41.227 --> 22:44.397
Ashley off the an early lead
now.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.565
Hit that ladder.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.667
Everybody hit their baskets at
once.

22:47.700 --> 22:54.140
That is how you do it right now.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.642
Devon hits his.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.409
You're up.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.111
Let's go.

22:59.145 --> 23:05.084
Next phase now is the monkey
bar.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.488
You are trying to release
another set of ladder rungs.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.388
You're good, Ben.

23:09.422 --> 23:14.761
It is mao Ben in the lead.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.095
Chrissy has hers.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.096
She's coming up.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.733
Mike has his.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.935
There comes Ryan.

23:22.969 --> 23:23.836
There's Ashley.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.472
Now you can start working on
your puzzles.

23:25.505 --> 23:31.678
It is now Devon once again in
dead last in this challenge.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.045
Devon is now up.

23:33.079 --> 23:37.684
Everybody now working on their
cog puzzle.

23:37.717 --> 23:42.321
This could be a million dollar
challenge for one of you.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.456
Nobody knows they're safe.

23:43.490 --> 23:48.360
The only way to be certain is to
win immunity right here.

23:48.394 --> 23:52.465
Everybody covered in sawdust,
trying to put together a very

23:52.499 --> 23:53.933
complicated cog puzzle.

23:53.966 --> 23:58.938
There are more spokes than you
need to use, but you need to use

23:58.971 --> 24:00.740
every cog.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.844
When you're finished, it will
turn and release your flag.

24:04.877 --> 24:08.715
That flag goes up, you win
immunity.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.884
Ryan going the take pieces off
and try something new.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.653
So many combinations.

24:13.686 --> 24:17.323
You don't know if it's right
until you try to give it a spin.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.958
And then you'll find out.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.927
Ben moving pieces around.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.395
Chrissy moving pieces around.

24:23.429 --> 24:26.999
It was not that listening ago
Chrissy was up here on this same

24:27.033 --> 24:30.803
platform in our first challenge
throwing up.

24:30.837 --> 24:36.142
Here we are 36 days later, she's
still in the game with a shot at

24:36.175 --> 24:37.977
winning it.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.211
Devon eyeballing.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.048
What do I need to do.

24:42.081 --> 24:45.284
Ashley moving very slowly with
each piece.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.155
Mike taking his time, sitting
down, no rush at all.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.223
Chrissy moving slowly and
methodically.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.993
One piece at a time.

24:54.026 --> 24:58.030
Really watching to see all the
pieces working together.

24:58.064 --> 25:03.736
Ben getting excited like he
might have something.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.672
Chrissy now picking up the pace.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.106
Ashley picking up the pace.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.041
Ben now picking up the pace.

25:09.075 --> 25:09.976
This is it.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.279
This is where it is won or lost
right here.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.815
36 days gets you to this spot.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.585
And now you have another
do-or-die to guarantee that you

25:18.618 --> 25:21.020
get to day 37.

25:21.053 --> 25:27.459
You never give up on "survivor."

25:27.493 --> 25:29.295
Chrissy thinks she has it.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.664
And she does.

25:31.698 --> 25:36.736
Chrissy wins individual immunity
guaranteed a spot in the final

25:36.769 --> 25:37.269
five.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.572
Nice job, Chrissy.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.306
Way to go.

25:40.339 --> 25:46.579
Thank you.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.215
JEFF: Chrissy, come on
over.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.017
Rights here.

25:51.050 --> 25:55.054
For the second time, individual
immunity is yours.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.023
Safe tonight at tribal council.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.691
Can not be voted out of this
game.

25:58.725 --> 26:02.461
As for the rest of you, it is so
hard to get to day 36.

26:02.494 --> 26:06.699
The end is so close, and yet for
one of you, you will not see it.

26:06.733 --> 26:07.934
Tribal council tonight.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.470
Somebody will become the sixth
member of our jury and it won't

26:11.503 --> 26:12.271
be you.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.039
Congrats.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.607
Grab you stuff, head back to
camp.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.775
See you tonight at tribal.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.646
My whole plan was the try to
win immunity is going into

26:19.679 --> 26:22.749
tribal council either Ashley or
Ben was available to be voted

26:22.782 --> 26:23.883
out.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.353
So I have to decide which one I
want to vote out first.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.389
This is my time to be many
control of the game.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.227
You killed that, Chrissy.

27:08.260 --> 27:08.761
Chrissy, the puzzle master.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.561
Way to go.

27:09.595 --> 27:12.264
Who knew you were good at
puzzles.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.301
How exciting is that?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.035
Damn, friggin puzzles.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.403
That was super fun.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.138
That was my favorite
challenge so far.

27:19.171 --> 27:19.906
Mine, too.

27:19.939 --> 27:20.940
Absolutely.

27:20.973 --> 27:21.507
This one hurts.

27:21.540 --> 27:25.444
This one hurts big time.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.513
I needed that one, because
considering how last tribal

27:27.546 --> 27:30.950
went, I'm 100% sure everyone is
targeting me tonight?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.052
Does anybody need water?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.621
But being marine, you never
give up.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.291
I'm going to go look around this
darn island for another idol.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.260
Those people are crazy for not
following me.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.196
If we could just go to tribal
right now that would be great.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.965
Because we already know
what's up.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.702
We all just vote Ben
and move on.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.537
Is everyone on board with
that?

27:51.570 --> 27:51.938
Yeah.

27:51.971 --> 27:52.504
Yep.

27:52.538 --> 27:53.405
Yeah.

27:53.439 --> 27:58.077
Who is Ben voting for?

27:58.110 --> 27:59.411
I don't know.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.648
Tonight it would be nice to f
we could get in, everyone vote

28:02.681 --> 28:04.116
for Ben and get out.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.787
Because last tribal it was
pretty shocking to see him whip

28:07.820 --> 28:09.021
out that idol.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.724
I don't think Ben has an idol,
but he's the most likely person

28:11.758 --> 28:14.493
to find one.

28:14.526 --> 28:21.033
I don't think he has an idol
you never know.

28:21.067 --> 28:26.105
It's scary if it did, it
would take one vote.

28:26.138 --> 28:30.476
If he pulls an idol, he's a
freakin' man.

28:30.509 --> 28:34.646
Should we take the chance and
split it between Mike and Ben?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.615
They don't expect that?

28:36.648 --> 28:37.183
Let's this that.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.485
Yeah, yeah.

28:39.518 --> 28:44.156
Ashley's plan is to split the
votes for Ben and Mike, see if

28:44.190 --> 28:47.894
minute plays the idol, and if no
one plays the idol, then vote

28:47.927 --> 28:49.161
out Ben.

28:49.195 --> 28:52.832
But I would actually like to vet
Ashley out first, because she is

28:52.865 --> 28:56.102
the one that I trust the least,
and I know she's gunning for me

28:56.135 --> 28:56.769
to be out.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.105
So I've got to get rid of her.

28:59.138 --> 29:02.008
I feel the same way about
Ashley as I feel about Ben,

29:02.041 --> 29:04.777
which is like get her the hell
out of this freaking game.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.245
This is what I would like to do.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.180
I want to send home Ashley.

29:08.214 --> 29:15.387
I want to convince Ben that he's
going home and have him gone.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.288
Everyone wants him out there.

29:16.322 --> 29:17.990
Are two more tribals before
final three.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.158
He's not going to win both.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.294
I feel like we have an
opportunity to get him out, get

29:22.328 --> 29:23.429
him out.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.933
There is a frosty that I
keep... that transcends this

29:26.966 --> 29:27.633
game.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.336
And that just makes me nervous.

29:30.369 --> 29:34.473
If I had my druthers, it would
go Ben, Ashley out.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.042
That's what I would say, too.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.309
Okay.

29:37.343 --> 29:41.613
I just don't know what I'm going
to do, but I seriously may make

29:41.647 --> 29:44.650
a late game-changing decision
based on my gut at tribal.

29:44.683 --> 29:48.921
I really like Ashley, and now
Chrissy starts pitching this

29:48.955 --> 29:53.292
idea of getting rid of Ashley
before Ben, which is just crazy

29:53.325 --> 29:57.163
to me, because Ben is dangerous.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.266
He has made big moves, and if
Ben is in the final three, none

30:00.299 --> 30:10.877
of us stand a chance.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.880
Looking around, and I peeng
around a tree, and I see a

30:13.913 --> 30:17.516
purple box with a black arrow
pointed down.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.584
No way!

30:18.617 --> 30:20.652
No way!

30:20.686 --> 30:27.759
Oh, my gosh.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.596
There is nothing more
valuable than being safe at

30:30.629 --> 30:31.630
tribal council.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.634
The immunity idol is tied to the
underside.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.869
You have to be clever.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.770
No way!

30:38.804 --> 30:39.438
No way!

30:39.471 --> 30:40.072
I found it.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.975
I found the dang clue.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.643
Oh, my gosh.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.445
I got the map to the idol.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.048
On it is a picture of our bed.

30:49.081 --> 30:53.485
And it has an x on the bed, so
I'm pretty nervous, because it's

30:53.519 --> 30:55.421
in plain sight of everybody.

30:55.454 --> 30:55.955
Thank you.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.189
Thank you, thank you.

30:57.223 --> 31:01.593
I'm hoping that nobody back at
camp...

31:01.627 --> 31:05.031
Yes!

31:05.064 --> 31:09.468
I get back the camp, and
Ryan, Devon, and Mike are at the

31:09.501 --> 31:10.402
fire.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.171
I don't know how I'm going to
pull this off.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.540
Cranberry bagel.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.542
I've had the cinnamon swirl.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.910
It's not that good.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.479
A jersey big ale is so much
better.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.983
Toasted with cream cheese,
it's good.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.017
It's small, too.

31:25.051 --> 31:25.918
No, it's not.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.954
Yes, it is.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.590
If I start digging around the
base of the bed and pull out a

31:31.623 --> 31:34.460
purple thing, everyone is going
to know what that is.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.727
I don't know how much time we
have left.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.629
I don't know, but I'm hungry.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.466
I don't know how much time we
have.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.668
Time is running out.

31:42.701 --> 31:52.078
I can't see nothing.

31:52.111 --> 31:55.181
Everybody in this camp wants me
gone, but if I can find the

31:55.214 --> 31:59.385
idol, I can blow up this whole
game, so I'm not going anywhere

31:59.418 --> 32:06.358
until I get that idol.

32:16.302 --> 32:22.141
JEFF: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

32:22.174 --> 32:27.613
Desi, Cole, j.P., Joe, and
Lauren voted out at the last

32:27.646 --> 32:33.019
tribal council.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.388
So, Ben, last tribal council you
played an idol, survived the

32:36.422 --> 32:37.423
vote.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.191
Was there any impact back at
camp after the tribal?

32:39.225 --> 32:41.593
I don't think it's changed
for anyone here.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.130
I think I'm still the number-one
target.

32:44.163 --> 32:48.500
These two are a nice tight-niche
group.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.336
These two are a nice tight
group.

32:50.369 --> 32:54.573
Mike is the swing in between
that, so it's tricky as heck for

32:54.606 --> 32:55.441
me.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.577
I'm trying the stay in this dang
game.

32:58.610 --> 33:02.281
First thing you said is these
two pointing to Ashley and Devon

33:02.314 --> 33:04.083
are a tight couple.

33:04.116 --> 33:06.618
Yet, Ashley, you weren't chosen
for the reward an you were

33:06.652 --> 33:07.519
clearly upset.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.721
Yeah, me and Dev, we have a
friendship.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.824
I thought maybe he would pick
me, but it wasn't just Devon's

33:12.858 --> 33:14.026
choice.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.828
It was also Chrissy's choice,
and I got the strategy behind

33:16.862 --> 33:18.097
her game play.

33:18.130 --> 33:22.234
I thought her comment, "well,
we know who makes the decisions,

33:22.268 --> 33:24.270
was poor sportsmanship.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.738
I did not mean it like that.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.006
It's a group decision.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.410
If it's just Devon, we're buddy,
Devon would pick me.

33:31.443 --> 33:35.914
JEFF: Mike, how important
is it to see the big picture, to

33:35.947 --> 33:39.651
say I cannot look at tonight's
vote.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.587
I have to look at the end and
start working backward.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.854
Right.

33:42.888 --> 33:47.159
Ben is clearly the biggest
threat in this game.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.527
That doesn't mean he's the only
threat.

33:48.560 --> 33:52.264
When you start looking at it
from an individual game, it's

33:52.298 --> 33:54.300
not just about getting to the
final three, it's about getting

33:54.333 --> 33:57.436
to the final three with people
you can trust, and at the end of

33:57.469 --> 33:58.604
the day, people you can beat.

33:58.637 --> 34:02.608
And however many offers you
have to the final three, you

34:02.641 --> 34:05.211
need the start checking, do I
want to be in the car with this

34:05.244 --> 34:06.378
person or this person?

34:06.412 --> 34:09.514
Do they want to be with me is
the more important question?

34:09.547 --> 34:14.018
It's the most powerful offer the
final three, but it has the most

34:14.052 --> 34:17.089
lucrative contract negotiations
in that this may not even have

34:17.123 --> 34:18.324
happen.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.025
What's funny about the offer
is that basically it's telling

34:20.058 --> 34:23.462
you, you think you can beat me,
so you want to go with me.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.429
Precisely.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.297
JEFF: Devon, do you have a
final three?

34:26.331 --> 34:27.299
Yes, I do.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.699
Chrissy, do you?

34:28.734 --> 34:29.135
Yes.

34:29.168 --> 34:29.935
JEFF: Mike?

34:29.967 --> 34:30.402
Yeah.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.303
JEFF: Ashley?

34:31.337 --> 34:32.571
Yes.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.373
JEFF: Ryan, you have a
final three?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.007
Is the pope catholic?

34:36.041 --> 34:36.775
Yes.

34:36.808 --> 34:37.976
So five of you have final
threes.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.011
Yeah, the math makes sense.

34:40.045 --> 34:44.014
JEFF: Ben, do you have a
final three... any of them.

34:44.049 --> 34:49.821
You know, I'm the lone wolf, and
I'm open for business.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.889
I'll take two of any of you with
me.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.927
JEFF: Mike, at what point
does Ben's offer actually become

34:55.960 --> 34:59.631
valuable, because after tonight,
there's only five people left.

34:59.665 --> 35:03.869
The problem is Ben has told
so many things that are not true

35:03.902 --> 35:06.305
to so many people at this point.

35:06.338 --> 35:09.675
And I really believe that
"survivor" is not just about

35:09.708 --> 35:13.345
blind sides and lying the people
and tricking people, it's played

35:13.379 --> 35:14.780
between those blindsides.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.284
You can build trust with people,
and you can play a good game.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.720
But at the same time, Ben is
very smart, and Ben is very

35:21.753 --> 35:22.588
tricky.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.323
I could see him getting his way
tonight.

35:24.356 --> 35:24.756
Right?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.226
Ben is a player.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.528
JEFF: Ashley, you reacted
when Mike said that.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.864
Yeah, I mean, if somebody
switches tonight on what I think

35:32.898 --> 35:36.335
is going to happen tonight, then
that's just another blind side

35:36.368 --> 35:40.239
for me that I wasn't part of, so
that leaves me to question, oh,

35:40.272 --> 35:42.774
is there plan that I don't know
about.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.311
JEFF: Ben, that's what
you're hoping for, is that

35:45.344 --> 35:49.047
people start to question and
doubt the people they're left

35:49.080 --> 35:49.415
with.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.616
Exactly.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.552
But it's hard playing the game
with people who aren't willing

35:53.585 --> 35:58.156
to make big moves and move
forward in the game.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.293
And we're at a point in the game
where resumes are going to start

36:01.327 --> 36:02.528
getting looked at.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.563
Coasting along might get you to
the end, but it's not going to

36:04.596 --> 36:06.598
get you the $1 million.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.767
These guys need the start making
some power moves.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.971
A power move being a mind
side, being able to...

36:13.004 --> 36:15.907
Hasn't every vote been a
blind side

36:15.941 --> 36:17.676
and what did you help with
those?

36:17.709 --> 36:20.912
Why would I tell you
everything about my game?

36:20.946 --> 36:24.082
Eventually you'll have to
tell me.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.352
If you want to know my
resume, I can tell you when

36:26.385 --> 36:28.554
you're over, there but until
then you should be happy to be

36:28.587 --> 36:29.655
here.

36:29.688 --> 36:33.692
Well, thank you, Devon, for
keeping me in this game.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.428
Jeff, I don't necessarily
think we need to wear our games

36:36.462 --> 36:37.563
on our sleeve either.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.766
Especially with someone
you're not aloned with and you

36:40.799 --> 36:41.900
don't trust.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.035
JEFF: So when you hear
Ben's comment, does it rattle

36:44.069 --> 36:45.304
you a little?

36:45.337 --> 36:46.305
No, not at all.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.206
I don't think Ben knows what
he's talking about.

36:48.240 --> 36:53.612
And I truly think Ben's going
home tonight.

36:53.645 --> 37:01.219
Hey, Jeff, should we just
church this up and get to the

37:01.253 --> 37:01.987
point.

37:02.020 --> 37:07.593
We'll just get to the point
here.

37:07.626 --> 37:12.731
Because I'm not going home
tonight.

37:12.764 --> 37:17.536
Secret, secret, secret.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.072
[MAKE EXPLOSION NOISE] Paragraph
I think that's more extreme than

37:21.106 --> 37:22.107
it needs to be.

37:22.140 --> 37:25.877
To make like it's this mass
explosion at tribal is

37:25.911 --> 37:26.945
exaggerated.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.181
I don't think that Ben just
necessarily blew up the

37:30.215 --> 37:31.016
intergame.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.851
I think it's just a little
ridiculous.

37:32.884 --> 37:33.619
That's all.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.454
Oh, lordy.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.655
JEFF: Wow, Ryan?

37:36.688 --> 37:39.691
The Ben bomb is dropped
again, right?

37:39.725 --> 37:43.829
The biggest twist in the game,
an unknown idol just came back

37:43.862 --> 37:46.665
into the game from a guy who is
potentially getting votes.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.868
But everyone remember that
just because it's around his

37:49.901 --> 37:51.737
neck right now doesn't mean he's
going to play it.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.673
Ashley, do you think there is
any chance that Ben might not

37:54.706 --> 37:55.441
play it?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.676
If I were Ben, I would play
it.

37:57.709 --> 38:01.179
You know, just because it's...

38:01.212 --> 38:04.450
Sorry, I'm a little lost for
words right now.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.685
You want to go back to camp
with me.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.086
Do you have a suggestion?

38:08.119 --> 38:08.954
Sure.

38:08.987 --> 38:13.258
What you got?

38:13.291 --> 38:16.828
You want to go back to camp
with me?

38:16.862 --> 38:22.033
What?

38:22.067 --> 38:29.174
Bell, I'm feeling like you might
in the play that.

38:29.207 --> 38:32.478
I'm in the final five.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.311
Okay.

38:33.345 --> 38:33.845
There we go.

38:33.879 --> 38:39.518
Good work.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.687
JEFF: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.756
He's playing it early as a sign
of power, maybe faith.

38:44.790 --> 38:49.127
I'm in the sure.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.161
How does this change things.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.830
We know if you cast a vote for
Ben, it won't count.

38:51.863 --> 38:55.367
It's a lot of confusion
because everybody had set plan,

38:55.401 --> 38:58.370
but somebody's plan is going to
be changed tonight, it's just a

38:58.404 --> 39:01.006
matter of whose plan is going to
be changed.

39:01.039 --> 39:05.043
JEFF: Mike, how unsettling
is this, because there is

39:05.076 --> 39:06.277
nowhere to hide.

39:06.311 --> 39:09.247
Ben has fast forwarded past
the vote, and all of this stuff

39:09.280 --> 39:11.617
is coming like 1,000 miles a
minute.

39:11.650 --> 39:16.254
But this is a game of
"survivor," and even sometimes

39:16.287 --> 39:20.392
your most trusted allys have to
go home.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.693
No Ben, why are you? Ielg?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.294
This is awesome, Jeff.

39:23.328 --> 39:25.997
I've just turned five against
themselves and got me one more

39:26.031 --> 39:28.066
day in this game.

39:28.099 --> 39:36.508
So mission accomplished.

39:36.542 --> 39:46.552
Ryan, you're up.

39:46.585 --> 39:53.058
Ryan, you're up.

40:06.137 --> 40:14.179
I'll go tally the votes.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.681
Ben has played his idol.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.816
If anybody else has a hidden
immunity idol and you want to

40:17.849 --> 40:21.386
play it, now would be the time
to do so.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.521
Okay.

40:22.554 --> 40:29.127
I'll read the votes.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.531
First vote, Mike.

40:32.564 --> 40:36.468
Ashley.

40:36.502 --> 40:37.268
Ashley.

40:37.302 --> 40:42.207
Two votes Ashley, one vote Mike.

40:42.240 --> 40:46.444
Ash limp that's three votes
Ashley, one vote Mike.

40:46.478 --> 40:50.248
I can't believe this.

40:50.281 --> 40:54.452
13th person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury,

40:54.486 --> 40:54.986
Ashley.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.121
You guys are crazy.

40:56.154 --> 40:56.922
JEFF:
That's four, that's enough.

40:56.955 --> 41:07.999
You need to bring me you torch.

41:08.033 --> 41:08.667
I'll see ya.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.735
Okay.

41:09.768 --> 41:16.875
Ouch.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.510
JEFF: Ashley, the tribe has
spoken.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.045
Thanks, Jeff.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.179
JEFF: Time for you to go.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.480
Thank you.

41:22.514 --> 41:23.314
Good luck, guys.

41:23.348 --> 41:24.650
By, ash.

41:24.683 --> 41:29.655
Bye, Ashley.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.929
JEFF: Well,
congratulations.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.998
You have made it to the final
five.

41:40.031 --> 41:44.002
And this season as much as any
other it is not been easy

41:44.035 --> 41:46.705
getting to the final three will
be even tougher.

41:46.738 --> 41:47.272
Grab your torches.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.106
Head back to camp.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.908

JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

42:04.489 --> 42:06.692
from our next episode.

42:09.595 --> 42:13.164
JEFF: Next time on the
season finale of "survivor,"

42:13.198 --> 42:15.433
only five are left.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.002
This is where it gets tricky.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.436
It's crazy it's coming down
to this.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.071
No matter what you expect,
something else is going to

42:20.105 --> 42:20.872
happen.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.441
This game could blow up yet
again.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.011
JEFF: The final secret
advantage of the game.

42:26.044 --> 42:32.684
Who will outlast all the rest
and claim the title of sole

42:32.718 --> 42:33.585
survivor?

42:33.619 --> 42:35.754
Join us for the live finale and
aftershow.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.323
36 out of 39 day, I couldn't
have gotten much closer than

42:38.356 --> 42:39.357
that.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.159
Devon completely went against
the alliance we had.

42:41.192 --> 42:45.764
I think there are hard feelings
still for the moment, but I did

42:45.797 --> 42:48.366
a lot better than I ever would
have imagined.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.737
This whole experience has given
me a brand-new outlook on life,

42:51.770 --> 42:53.805
and I couldn't be more grateful
than that.
