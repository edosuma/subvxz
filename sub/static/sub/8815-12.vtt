Lucifer Morningstar.

That puts you in my good graces how?

Chloe Decker is the one I

02:56.707 --> 02:58.107
Who knows what she's hiding.

02:58.175 --> 03:00.743
Yes, she seems to be the
one thing that can hurt me,

03:00.811 --> 03:02.111
but there may be other things as well.

03:02.179 --> 03:04.613
The detective may simply
be a cog in a bigger machine.

03:04.681 --> 03:06.749
This is called being thorough.

03:06.817 --> 03:07.917
More like denial.

03:07.984 --> 03:09.285
Because if you really thought

03:09.353 --> 03:10.753
that I could hurt you with these,

03:10.821 --> 03:12.088
you wouldn't let me

03:12.155 --> 03:13.489
throw them at you.

03:15.292 --> 03:16.959
Very funny.

03:17.027 --> 03:19.061
Demon daggers forged

03:19.129 --> 03:21.931
We all know those prick.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.034
And speaking of,

03:25.102 --> 03:27.636
how's my brother?

03:27.704 --> 03:30.439
Three weeks of a whole lot of this?

03:30.507 --> 03:32.775
How do you think he's doing?

03:32.843 --> 03:34.243
You're not going steady, Maze.

03:34.311 --> 03:35.978
You're getting
close to him for a reason.

03:36.046 --> 03:36.979
Don't forget it.

03:37.047 --> 03:38.147
I haven't.

03:38.215 --> 03:39.482
And I don't think Amenadiel

03:39.549 --> 03:41.083
is the one weaponizing Chloe.

03:41.151 --> 03:42.385
You don't think?

03:42.452 --> 03:44.353
Game's too dangerous to be guessing.

03:44.421 --> 03:46.355
I think it's time to send

03:46.423 --> 03:48.691

04:25.495 --> 04:27.534
Well, I do have a
business to run, Detective.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.031
I can't play Good Cop/Handsome Devil Cop

Yeah, excuse me,
Detective, I'm not hearing

05:12.776 --> 05:14.844
any reasons to why you
need me on this case.

can hear anything...

why you need me on this case.

Just wanted to do my

If, uh, if we could talk soon,

07:38.762 --> 07:40.329
some stuff went down with Malcolm.

07:40.397 --> 07:41.931
I mean, I know now's a bad time...

07:41.998 --> 07:44.033
Yeah, it is.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.569
This bruising here around
the stab wounds.

07:46.636 --> 07:47.903
DAN: Hilt marks maybe.

07:47.971 --> 07:49.205
And these.

07:49.272 --> 07:51.073
There's subdermal implants.

07:51.141 --> 07:52.508
They don't look fresh.

07:52.576 --> 07:53.709
I don't know what they are.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.578
Symbols? Designs maybe?

07:55.645 --> 07:57.746
Well, not a lot of places do that
kind of body modification.

07:57.814 --> 08:00.382
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

08:00.450 --> 08:01.684
All right.

He and I have to meet Rose's
father at her apartment.

08:04.387 --> 08:06.021

Uh, 1625 Lynrose.

08:09.092 --> 08:10.426
Right, I'll see you there.

08:10.493 --> 08:12.094

08:12.162 --> 08:13.329

08:30.088 --> 08:30.588
Yes.

08:30.614 --> 08:33.414
Well, we were when she was little, but

08:33.482 --> 08:35.551
you know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

08:35.619 --> 08:38.687
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

08:38.755 --> 08:39.822
excuses.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.789
Can you tell us why
Rose marred herself recently

08:41.857 --> 08:44.025
with subdermal implants?
- What?

08:44.094 --> 08:45.728
That doesn't sound like Rosie.

08:59.342 --> 09:01.443
Oh, lovely.

09:01.511 --> 09:04.713
Very mid-century rapist.

09:06.082 --> 09:08.017
Hello, bad guys?

09:22.599 --> 09:24.733
What is this place?

09:26.569 --> 09:28.671
It's a creepy, secret evil room.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.172
You didn't know about this?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.408
No.

09:36.813 --> 09:38.180
What's this?

09:38.248 --> 09:40.349
It's a chicken.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.817
Or what's left of it.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.752
If that's supposed to
be an offering for me,

09:43.820 --> 09:46.622
then I decline on grounds of salmonella.

09:49.225 --> 09:50.759

09:50.827 --> 09:52.962

Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

09:56.599 --> 09:58.734
But maybe this wasn't a random attack.

09:58.802 --> 10:01.236
Maybe your daughter was
involved with whoever killed her.

10:01.304 --> 10:02.905
It's a large man by the looks of it,

10:02.973 --> 10:06.608
who's, uh, not a fan of bathing.

10:06.676 --> 10:08.210
MR. DAVIS: This is crazy.

10:08.278 --> 10:10.746
I mean, even if she was into
this stupid Devil thing,

10:10.814 --> 10:12.748
she wouldn't have sacrificed herself.

10:12.816 --> 10:15.217
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.119
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

10:17.187 --> 10:19.655
Maybe.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.993
"For my Corazon.

10:24.060 --> 10:24.793
Love, Rose."

10:24.861 --> 10:25.861
"Corazon" is Spanish for heart.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.464
Could be a term of endearment.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.466
Could be a name.

10:30.533 --> 10:34.236
MR. DAVIS: I should've reached out.

10:34.304 --> 10:36.605
Called more.

10:36.673 --> 10:38.774
I thought I knew her.

10:38.842 --> 10:42.911
Oh, yes, I know exactly how you feel.

10:42.979 --> 10:44.913
(phone rings)

10:47.417 --> 10:48.784
Decker.

10:48.852 --> 10:51.887
We called around, found the
girl that gave Rose her subdermals.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.690
Said she, uh, came in a couple
weeks ago with a guy.

10:54.758 --> 10:56.625
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

10:56.693 --> 10:58.227
but she can't remember it.

10:58.294 --> 10:59.828
Ask if the name's Corazon.

10:59.896 --> 11:03.165
Hey. Was the guy's name Corazon?

11:03.233 --> 11:04.566
Yeah, that's it.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.769
Uh, jet black hair, lots
of piercings and tattoos.

11:08.104 --> 11:09.938
Did you hear that?

11:10.006 --> 11:11.206
Yeah, generic Satanist.

11:11.274 --> 11:13.642
What about the, uh,
subdermals... she know what they mean?

11:13.710 --> 11:14.676
No.

11:14.744 --> 11:16.278
Says Rose brought them in herself.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.313
She was super secretive about 'em.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.448
Uh-huh.

11:19.516 --> 11:21.350
We'll talk soon.

11:21.418 --> 11:23.352
- Ah, look at you two.
- (sighs)

11:23.420 --> 11:24.686
Marriage falling apart,

11:24.754 --> 11:26.155
trying to work together...

11:26.222 --> 11:27.723
So cute.

11:27.791 --> 11:29.458
Yeah, well, maybe if you
hadn't sent her a break-up text

11:29.526 --> 11:31.326
- while I was unconscious...
- Oh.

11:31.394 --> 11:32.995
Hey, speaking of

11:33.063 --> 11:35.531
kicking your ass, I'm
proud of you for bouncing back.

11:35.598 --> 11:37.299
Friends fight, right?

11:37.367 --> 11:38.801
Yeah.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.602
Dick.

11:40.670 --> 11:42.805
(distant siren wailing)

11:45.141 --> 11:46.842
(alarm chirps)

11:49.279 --> 11:50.646
(growling)

11:50.713 --> 11:51.847
(grunts)

11:53.483 --> 11:55.084
Why is Lucifer still alive?

11:55.151 --> 11:56.018
Oh, it's you.

11:56.086 --> 11:57.119
You scared me, dude.

11:57.187 --> 11:58.554
Have you forgotten what
will happen to you

11:58.621 --> 12:00.022
if you don't comply with our deal?

12:00.090 --> 12:03.025
No, but I forgot to tell you!

12:03.093 --> 12:04.960
Lucifer spilled the beans.

12:07.885 --> 12:09.498
What are you talking about?

12:09.566 --> 12:10.566
All that jazz about

12:10.633 --> 12:12.601
condemning me to eternal damnation?

12:12.669 --> 12:14.269
Poppycock, apparently.

12:14.337 --> 12:16.071
You're an angel

12:16.139 --> 12:18.807
and Lucifer said that you're
not allowed to kill me.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.709
Plus...

12:20.777 --> 12:22.578
I got this beauty right here.

12:22.645 --> 12:25.080
It's my get-out-of-Hell-free card.

12:25.148 --> 12:27.082
(growls)

12:28.685 --> 12:31.153
(sighs)

12:31.221 --> 12:32.721
So...

12:32.789 --> 12:36.091
unless you got a better offer...

12:36.159 --> 12:40.062
#TeamLucifer.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.364
It's not half bad, this.

12:42.432 --> 12:44.166
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

12:44.234 --> 12:45.934
but it's not complete drivel.

12:46.002 --> 12:47.035
Listen to this:

12:47.103 --> 12:49.605
"Satan represents a beacon of honesty

12:49.672 --> 12:53.075
in a sea of mass self-deceit."

12:53.143 --> 12:54.076
Mmm.

12:54.144 --> 12:55.277
And... oh. Hello.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.168
There's a whole chapter on sex.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.522
I like this book.

12:58.615 --> 13:01.183
Rose's subdermal implants...

13:01.251 --> 13:03.418
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

13:03.486 --> 13:06.121
But I've arranged
them 100 different ways

13:06.189 --> 13:08.891
and I can't come up with
anything significant.

13:08.958 --> 13:12.327
"Chili furis"?

13:12.395 --> 13:16.365
"I hurl ficis"?

13:18.067 --> 13:19.768
No.

13:19.836 --> 13:22.504
But could... could
you come over here, please?

13:30.446 --> 13:32.548
Oh, bloody hell.

13:34.951 --> 13:36.518
Filii hircus. It's Latin.

13:36.586 --> 13:37.619
Means "children of the goat."

13:37.687 --> 13:39.555
Why do they always associate
me with goats?

13:39.622 --> 13:41.182
I mean, I don't even like their cheese.

13:42.392 --> 13:43.625
Here we go.

13:43.693 --> 13:45.093
"Church of the Dark Prince."

13:48.698 --> 13:49.998
Location is secret.

13:50.066 --> 13:52.501
Looks like you have to be a member.

13:52.569 --> 13:55.871
Geez, look at this questionnaire.

13:55.939 --> 13:57.506
Oh, and of course,

13:57.574 --> 13:59.007
there's a fee.

13:59.075 --> 14:00.609
$200? Sinful.

14:00.677 --> 14:03.111
There's got to be a faster way.

14:03.179 --> 14:06.315
LUCIFER: "What is
your gift to the Devil?"

14:06.382 --> 14:09.618
CHLOE: How about... filii hircus?

14:09.686 --> 14:11.119
Yes!

14:11.187 --> 14:12.354
(mumbling to self)

14:13.856 --> 14:15.691
All right. Okay... what...

14:15.758 --> 14:17.893
Yeah, I'll see you there!

14:19.829 --> 14:20.929
What...?

14:20.997 --> 14:23.465
♪ ♪

14:33.243 --> 14:34.409
(clears throat)

14:37.146 --> 14:38.280
Okay.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.349
That's it.

14:40.416 --> 14:41.450
You're being a freak.

14:41.517 --> 14:43.719
You've been avoiding me for weeks,

14:43.786 --> 14:45.187
you won't get in my car.

14:45.255 --> 14:46.421
What's your problem?

14:46.489 --> 14:47.456
There's no problem.

14:47.523 --> 14:48.924
Just maybe you're not as charming

14:48.992 --> 14:51.727
as you think you are.

14:51.794 --> 14:54.563
Wait, is this about that
vulnerability thing?

14:54.631 --> 14:56.598
Actually, yes.

14:58.301 --> 15:00.836
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

15:00.903 --> 15:02.371
and you freak out.

15:02.438 --> 15:04.039
Ugh. All I meant that night

15:04.107 --> 15:05.707
is that I can trust you.

15:06.909 --> 15:08.176
That's all.

15:08.244 --> 15:09.177
Okay?

15:09.245 --> 15:10.145
Okay.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.380
Okay.

15:11.447 --> 15:12.347
Okay.

15:20.356 --> 15:22.090
(clears throat)

15:22.158 --> 15:24.593
(whispering) Filii hircus.

15:26.362 --> 15:27.763
(sighs)

15:27.830 --> 15:28.997
Habeas corpus?

15:29.065 --> 15:30.299
Bababooey?

15:30.366 --> 15:32.434
You had it right the first time.

15:32.502 --> 15:34.736
But today is private.

15:35.905 --> 15:39.274
Too private for Lucifer himself?

15:39.342 --> 15:40.475
You're supposed to be blond.

15:40.543 --> 15:43.278
Yes, I get that a lot.

15:43.346 --> 15:45.414
- You have ID?
- Absolutely.

15:45.481 --> 15:47.082
Let me just, uh...

15:47.150 --> 15:48.350
Oh. Dearie me.

15:48.418 --> 15:49.618
I seem to have left it in the car.

15:49.686 --> 15:51.486
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

15:51.554 --> 15:53.504
What am I, your dog?

16:01.466 --> 16:02.657
Detective...

16:02.812 --> 16:04.195
After you.

16:13.512 --> 16:15.118
It's very Eyes Wide Shut.

16:15.254 --> 16:17.937
Too bad I forgot my sexy mask.

16:18.005 --> 16:20.206
Does anything scare you?

16:20.274 --> 16:21.474
Should it?

16:21.542 --> 16:23.877
MAN: Rose is gone.

16:23.944 --> 16:25.712
But it is not her
death that was important,

16:25.779 --> 16:27.013
it was her life.

16:27.081 --> 16:29.048
The imprint she left behind.

16:29.116 --> 16:31.818
See, Rose will be remembered.

16:31.886 --> 16:33.920
She will live on forever.

16:33.988 --> 16:36.189
This isn't a sacrifice.

16:36.257 --> 16:37.323
It's a memorial.

16:37.391 --> 16:38.791
Quite civilized, actually.

16:38.859 --> 16:41.436
Yeah, they don't seem like killers.

16:41.461 --> 16:42.319
Mmm.

16:42.363 --> 16:43.763
ONYX: And so now

16:43.831 --> 16:46.399
it is time to invoke

16:46.467 --> 16:48.701
the Four Crowned Princes of Hell.

16:48.769 --> 16:50.270
Oh. Scratch that.

16:50.337 --> 16:52.305
Visualize the blue light

16:52.373 --> 16:54.307
filling your entire being.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.910
Satan to the east.

16:56.977 --> 16:58.811
Beelzebub to the north...

16:58.879 --> 17:00.180
This is preposterous.

17:00.247 --> 17:02.315
I thought you'd love this.

17:02.383 --> 17:03.750
First of all, there's only one me.

17:03.817 --> 17:06.152
And secondly, the whole
worship thing is more my father's bag.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.621
And now...

17:08.689 --> 17:11.558
Lucifer will speak!

17:11.625 --> 17:12.559
What?

17:15.729 --> 17:17.096
- (thump)
- Ooh.

17:17.164 --> 17:19.132
Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.576
This is where I draw the line.

17:20.601 --> 17:21.059
Ow.

17:21.101 --> 17:23.536
- Ow.
- Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

17:23.604 --> 17:24.737
Sorry.

17:24.805 --> 17:25.771
MAN: Hey, man.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.373
If you would just butt out.

17:27.441 --> 17:28.174
Right!

17:28.242 --> 17:29.742
I'm the real Lucifer

17:29.810 --> 17:32.979
and I insist that you
stop this nonsense immediately.

17:33.047 --> 17:34.407
I mean, have you heard yourselves?

17:34.430 --> 17:35.205
It's embarrassing.

17:35.249 --> 17:36.926
Blue light coming out your ass

17:36.927 --> 17:37.826
or whatever it was.

17:37.977 --> 17:39.986
I mean, you preach rebellion,

17:40.054 --> 17:41.721
but you're-you're misguided sheep.

17:41.789 --> 17:43.289
And goat.

17:43.357 --> 17:44.958
Where's the real defiance?

17:45.025 --> 17:46.593
- The free will?
- SATANIST: Yeah!

17:46.660 --> 17:47.594
Free will!

17:47.661 --> 17:48.695
Free will rules!

17:48.762 --> 17:50.063
(applause)

17:50.130 --> 17:51.965
No, no! You're doing it again.

17:52.032 --> 17:53.266
Don't applaud.

17:53.334 --> 17:54.867
This whole thing's a sham!

17:54.935 --> 17:55.868
(woman whoops)

17:55.936 --> 17:57.136
Anarchy!

17:57.204 --> 17:58.137
(cheering, whooping)

17:58.205 --> 17:59.372
I mean, just-just look at this.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.241
What is this supposed to be?

18:03.010 --> 18:04.477
Alien fetus?

18:04.545 --> 18:06.112
Pickled demon?

18:06.180 --> 18:08.214
He's the best
Lucifer we've had in years.

18:08.282 --> 18:11.284
(chanting) Lucifer! Lucifer!

18:11.352 --> 18:13.286
- Lucifer...
- Stop!

18:14.822 --> 18:16.789
Someone killed this girl!

18:16.857 --> 18:18.191
She didn't deserve that.

18:18.259 --> 18:20.460
This is not what I stand for.

18:20.527 --> 18:23.496
Is that what you all wanted? Eh?

18:27.468 --> 18:30.370
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

18:34.942 --> 18:35.908
LAPD.

18:35.976 --> 18:37.610
Put the knife down.

18:41.215 --> 18:43.349
Why were you running?

18:44.218 --> 18:45.652
I wasn't.

18:45.719 --> 18:46.653
I was upset.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.021
Feeling guilty, are you?

18:48.088 --> 18:49.188
Tell me... why?

18:49.256 --> 18:51.691
What, our new Devil's a cop, now, is he?

18:51.759 --> 18:53.459
LUCIFER: Oh, worse
than that, I'm afraid.

18:53.527 --> 18:54.427
So come on.

18:54.495 --> 18:56.195
Tell me, what nasty little urge

18:56.263 --> 18:58.564
are you hiding in your hoodie, hmm?

19:01.068 --> 19:02.368
I want to kill...

19:02.436 --> 19:03.503
Yeah?

19:03.570 --> 19:06.773
I want to kill the sick
bastard who killed Rose.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.007
And then, after that,

19:08.075 --> 19:11.477
I want the hell out of this racket.

19:11.545 --> 19:13.713
Oh.

19:13.781 --> 19:15.548
What's your name?

19:15.616 --> 19:16.649
Onyx.

19:16.717 --> 19:17.717
Hmm?

19:17.785 --> 19:19.118
(sighs)

19:19.186 --> 19:21.154
Mitch Watson.

19:21.221 --> 19:23.089
Yeah, I changed it when
I joined the church.

19:23.157 --> 19:26.592
12 years later, I'm the
frickin' high priest.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.593
I'd love to bail.

19:27.661 --> 19:29.462
Kind of late for a
career change, though.

19:29.530 --> 19:32.165
I mean, the whole thing's a joke.

19:32.232 --> 19:33.666
So, hold on...

19:33.734 --> 19:35.802
Are you saying you
don't believe in Lucifer?

19:35.869 --> 19:38.438
Look, mate, the Devil ain't
gonna buy me an Aston Martin.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.065
Well, not with that attitude, he won't.

19:40.107 --> 19:42.075
I mean, I like the philosophy.

19:42.142 --> 19:43.776
But it attracts a lot of weirdoes

19:43.844 --> 19:45.545
who take it way too seriously.

19:45.612 --> 19:46.813
And, of course,

19:46.880 --> 19:48.414
now Rosie's dead.

19:48.482 --> 19:49.942
Yeah, and I see you have the same

19:49.967 --> 19:51.341
subdermal implants as she did.

19:51.385 --> 19:52.652
All the hard core members...

19:52.720 --> 19:53.786
they all get this.

19:53.854 --> 19:54.921
I was trying to tell Rosie

19:54.988 --> 19:56.356
that she would regret it later,

19:56.423 --> 19:58.858
but she became obsessed.

19:58.926 --> 20:00.560
She was an impressionable girl.

20:00.627 --> 20:02.161
Well, her father was absentee.

20:02.229 --> 20:04.831
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

20:04.898 --> 20:06.232
to piss her dad off.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.201
Actually, it was,
uh... it was her boyfriend,

20:08.268 --> 20:10.069
Corazon, he's the
one who brought her in.

20:10.137 --> 20:12.038
Man, the guy's a creeper.

20:12.106 --> 20:14.841
He kept talking about
doing real sacrifices on animals.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.111
Did Corazon have access to this knife?

20:18.178 --> 20:20.346
Yeah, probably.

20:21.348 --> 20:23.649
This here is just for show.

20:23.717 --> 20:26.853
The blade springs inside the handle.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.321
Hmm. Strange.

20:28.389 --> 20:30.523
'Cause if it was
real... it could definitely match

20:30.591 --> 20:31.991
the marks found on Rose's body.

20:32.059 --> 20:33.726
We do have an actual version.

20:33.794 --> 20:34.727
Hold on.

20:38.932 --> 20:40.366
Knife's gone.

20:40.434 --> 20:41.868
Okay, we need to find Corazon now.

20:41.935 --> 20:42.969
- Yeah.
- Do you have, um,

20:43.036 --> 20:44.237
his real name,

20:44.304 --> 20:46.005
uh, where he lives, his address?

20:46.073 --> 20:47.373
Give me a sec.

20:50.711 --> 20:52.311
Ugh.

20:55.182 --> 20:56.616
Looks just like you.

20:56.683 --> 20:58.184
I manscape.

20:59.653 --> 21:02.955
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

21:03.023 --> 21:04.957
All-powerful...

21:05.025 --> 21:06.092
Invincible...

21:06.160 --> 21:07.527
Not exactly.

21:08.962 --> 21:12.965
Ah. Or it's because you think that
everybody's out to get you.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.066
That's because they are.

21:14.134 --> 21:15.802
But trust me, I didn't choose it.

21:15.869 --> 21:17.870
Why would anyone choose to be vilified?

21:17.938 --> 21:20.072
Thought the Devil was
supposed to be immortal.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.275
Well, one angel can hurt another, so...

21:28.248 --> 21:29.882
Oh, what...?

21:31.251 --> 21:32.819
What are you doing?

21:32.886 --> 21:34.454
(door opens)

21:34.521 --> 21:38.020
No address, no last name, nothing.

21:38.859 --> 21:39.759
Hmm.

21:39.827 --> 21:42.128
He used PayPal to pay for the fee.

21:42.196 --> 21:44.430
All right, I'll call in a warrant.

21:49.736 --> 21:52.805
Well, if you can't
bring Muhammad to the dim sum...

21:59.980 --> 22:01.914
Hey.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.649
Why'd you stand me up?

22:03.717 --> 22:05.918
I had one task...

22:05.986 --> 22:08.454
one...

22:08.522 --> 22:10.790
to get my brother back to Hell.

22:15.829 --> 22:17.563
I've not only failed,

22:17.631 --> 22:20.399
but I've actually made things worse.

22:20.467 --> 22:22.869
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

22:26.073 --> 22:28.274
Yeah, you lucky son of a bitch.

22:28.342 --> 22:32.345
Come on, you can't say

22:32.412 --> 22:36.616
that this isn't the
best sex you've ever had.

22:36.683 --> 22:39.085
Well, it is the only sex you've
ever had, but still.

22:39.152 --> 22:41.087
(chuckles)

22:41.154 --> 22:44.891
Look, I've had a lot of sex,

22:44.958 --> 22:48.160
with men and women.

22:48.228 --> 22:49.896
- I mean a lot.
- Okay.

22:49.963 --> 22:51.297
Point made.

22:51.365 --> 22:54.834
But this, with you,

22:54.902 --> 22:56.302
I don't know, it's...

22:56.370 --> 22:58.838
it's different.

23:08.448 --> 23:11.384
But if you're not happy here,

23:11.451 --> 23:13.586
then you should go home.

23:13.654 --> 23:16.689
I can't.

23:16.757 --> 23:21.027
I can't face my father as a failure.

23:21.094 --> 23:23.029
Look, I have a job to do.

23:23.096 --> 23:25.264
There's no choice.

23:25.332 --> 23:28.367
I understand.

23:37.411 --> 23:39.078
<i>CHLOE: Okay. Great.</i>

23:39.146 --> 23:40.346
Yeah, I'll be here.

23:40.414 --> 23:41.614
All right.

23:41.682 --> 23:43.683
So we got a real name for Corazon...

23:43.750 --> 23:45.718
Mike Carey... but it
could take us a while to find him,

23:45.786 --> 23:47.187
so you should probably head home.

23:47.212 --> 23:47.911
Oh, no, no, no.

23:47.955 --> 23:50.089
Not till this human
stain's brought to justice.

23:50.157 --> 23:52.291
(scoffs) I can't get near you,

23:52.359 --> 23:54.026
now I can't get rid of you.

23:54.094 --> 23:55.027
Whatever.

23:55.095 --> 23:56.295
I'm gonna go up and shower.

23:56.363 --> 23:57.964
Stay put. Do not wake up Trixie.

24:00.701 --> 24:02.635
♪ ♪

24:07.975 --> 24:09.875
(sighs)

24:18.251 --> 24:20.953
Did you just throw a toy at me?

24:21.021 --> 24:22.221
Oh, you're awake.

24:22.289 --> 24:24.190
But since you're up, I
have some questions for you.

24:24.257 --> 24:25.758
Right.

24:25.826 --> 24:27.860
Are you adopted?

24:27.928 --> 24:31.030
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

24:31.098 --> 24:32.665
Could she be from somewhere else?

24:32.733 --> 24:34.600
Does she have any special powers?

24:34.668 --> 24:37.136
Uh-uh. What about any markings?

24:37.204 --> 24:39.939
Scars, on her back perhaps?

24:40.007 --> 24:42.274
There's some chocolate
cake in it for you.

24:42.342 --> 24:44.076
I want cash.

24:44.144 --> 24:45.578
Oh.

24:45.646 --> 24:48.814
(chuckles) I like your style.

24:48.882 --> 24:50.750
All right.

24:50.817 --> 24:52.418
Mommy does have a scar.

24:52.486 --> 24:54.420
- Oh?
- On her butt.

24:54.488 --> 24:56.088
From when she got bit.

24:56.156 --> 24:57.556
By the Kraken.

24:57.624 --> 24:58.791
Right.

24:59.826 --> 25:01.260
Not the direction I was going for,

25:01.328 --> 25:03.362
but what's this Kraken that you talk of?

25:03.430 --> 25:06.132
CHLOE: My mom's evil Chihuahua.

25:06.199 --> 25:07.400
Why aren't you showering?

25:07.467 --> 25:08.868
'Cause I left my phone down here.

25:08.935 --> 25:10.136
Why is Trixie awake?

25:10.203 --> 25:12.838
- (snaps)
- Get back in bed, young lady.

25:12.906 --> 25:13.873
Night, Lucifer.

25:13.940 --> 25:16.842
All right, seriously.

25:16.910 --> 25:19.078
No more freaky behavior.

25:19.146 --> 25:21.213
If this is about the
other night, I'm sorry, okay?

25:21.281 --> 25:23.056
What do you want me to
do, take it all back?

25:23.057 --> 25:25.051
No, can you take your shirt off, please?

25:25.118 --> 25:26.018
What?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.454
Are you serious?

25:28.522 --> 25:29.822
I need to see your back.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.223
Why?

25:31.291 --> 25:34.727
Because I want to know if
you're an angel sent to destroy me.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.567
(sighs)

25:44.371 --> 25:46.572
Nothing.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.641
Yeah.

25:48.709 --> 25:50.710
Is this about the scars on your back?

25:50.777 --> 25:54.914
Look, I have no
idea what happened to you

25:54.981 --> 25:56.449
or what's going on with you now,

25:56.516 --> 25:59.652
but... not everyone's out to get you.

26:01.121 --> 26:02.855
(phone buzzing)

26:02.923 --> 26:05.791
They found him... Corazon.

26:15.936 --> 26:17.603
WOMAN: We found his car like this.

26:17.671 --> 26:19.805
It's registered to Mike Carey.

26:24.745 --> 26:26.612
- (clattering)
- (gasps)

26:29.516 --> 26:30.850
(Malcolm chuckles)

26:30.917 --> 26:32.852
Just like old times, huh?

26:32.919 --> 26:34.220
Don't shoot me though.

26:34.287 --> 26:35.221
Funny.

26:35.288 --> 26:36.555
Come on, I'm just joking.

26:36.623 --> 26:37.990
(clattering)

26:40.660 --> 26:43.896
Ah, Detective Douche, Detective Stache.

26:43.964 --> 26:45.097
What a pleasant surprise.

26:45.165 --> 26:46.232
Did you find anything?

26:46.299 --> 26:48.100
Place seems empty.

26:57.477 --> 27:00.579
CHLOE (whispering): My God.

27:15.453 --> 27:16.753
It's definitely Mike Carey.

27:16.821 --> 27:19.889
Detectives, can I show you something?

27:22.760 --> 27:24.527
(siren wailing)

27:24.595 --> 27:26.763
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

27:26.831 --> 27:28.965
The "Hail, Lucifer," the pentagram?

27:29.033 --> 27:33.737
I think it's a long time
since I encountered genuine evil.

27:33.804 --> 27:35.038
Wow.

27:38.943 --> 27:40.410
(sniffing)

27:40.478 --> 27:42.345
It's not blood. It's paint.

27:44.682 --> 27:46.783
So the killer strapped Mike up

27:46.851 --> 27:49.753
then decided to go all Jackson Pollock?

27:49.820 --> 27:52.021
I guess.

27:52.089 --> 27:55.525
Yeah, looks like an "A."

27:55.593 --> 27:56.993
That can't be random.

27:57.061 --> 27:58.728
I think it's a word.

28:07.972 --> 28:11.841
(gasps) Giant anamorphic print.

28:11.909 --> 28:13.843
"Morningstar."

28:13.911 --> 28:16.212
DAN: Whoa.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.081
Another Satanic message.

28:18.149 --> 28:19.449
Or a fan letter.

28:19.517 --> 28:21.751
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the Devil.

28:21.819 --> 28:24.454
You think someone
did this for our Lucifer?

28:24.522 --> 28:25.989
That's kind of a leap, Dan.

28:26.056 --> 28:28.725
Yeah, but if I'm right,
it's also a conflict of interest.

28:28.793 --> 28:30.860
Somebody could be
doing this on his behalf,

28:30.928 --> 28:32.595
or maybe he's
involved in a different way.

28:32.663 --> 28:34.397
- What does that mean?
- LUCIFER: Yes.

28:34.465 --> 28:36.866
What are you insinuating?

28:36.934 --> 28:38.401
That some psycho might be killing people

28:38.469 --> 28:39.936
because of your whole Devil shtick.

28:40.004 --> 28:41.504
You're blaming this nonsense on me?

28:41.572 --> 28:43.740
You do take the whole
Satan thing pretty seriously.

28:43.808 --> 28:45.675
You really think I'd
do these vile things?

28:45.743 --> 28:48.411
These kids were pretending to be bad,

28:48.479 --> 28:49.959
but they weren't, they were innocent,

28:50.014 --> 28:51.881
so I would never hurt
them, I'm not a monster.

28:51.949 --> 28:52.916
CHLOE: Okay, guys.

28:52.983 --> 28:54.517
That's enough.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.022
Lucifer, maybe you should go home.

28:59.089 --> 29:02.492
Oh, no, allow me to stay in
this rusty tin can a little longer.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.261
You came to me, you
insisted I work this case.

29:05.329 --> 29:07.530
Okay, this sounds crazy,

29:07.598 --> 29:09.499
but this case might involve you.

29:09.567 --> 29:10.834
What do you mean, involve me?

29:10.901 --> 29:11.935
You know what I mean.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.603
- (sighs)
- I'm trying to protect you.

29:13.671 --> 29:18.541
Oh, protect me from the
evil or the world from evil me?

29:25.916 --> 29:27.484
Can you believe Detective von Douche

29:27.551 --> 29:29.252
boots me off the case?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.987
And Chloe agreed to this?

29:31.055 --> 29:32.388
(sighs) She didn't disagree.

29:32.456 --> 29:33.756
(chuckles incredulously)

29:33.824 --> 29:35.725
How could she even think I'm capable?

29:35.793 --> 29:36.860
Here?

29:36.927 --> 29:39.062
That's why I left.

29:39.129 --> 29:40.530
I thought she knew me.

29:40.598 --> 29:41.798
I thought I knew her.

29:41.866 --> 29:43.466
And now you don't trust her anymore?

29:43.534 --> 29:46.936
Oh, it's just this
whole immortality thing.

29:47.004 --> 29:49.105
Uh, for some reason,

29:49.173 --> 29:51.741
Detective Decker makes me vulnerable.

29:51.809 --> 29:54.544
Also known as "intimacy."

29:54.612 --> 29:57.981
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

29:58.048 --> 30:00.783
Being vulnerable can be scary.

30:00.851 --> 30:04.287
But there are benefits when
you open yourself up to someone.

30:04.355 --> 30:06.089
I just wish I knew who was behind this.

30:06.156 --> 30:07.223
My dad?

30:07.291 --> 30:08.224
My brother?

30:08.292 --> 30:09.559
Someone else?

30:09.627 --> 30:11.628
I mean, the
detective doesn't seem to know,

30:11.695 --> 30:12.962
but she could be lying.

30:13.030 --> 30:14.497
Is she part of the plan to kill me,

30:14.565 --> 30:16.299
or is she just a-a pawn?

30:16.367 --> 30:18.301
Maybe we should explore the possibility

30:18.369 --> 30:21.638
that being
vulnerable can be a good thing.

30:21.705 --> 30:23.873
No, it can't.

30:23.941 --> 30:26.142
It means you're at someone else's mercy.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.845
Then maybe you should
just stay away from everybody.

30:28.913 --> 30:30.647
Stay away from Chloe.

30:30.714 --> 30:33.616
But...

30:33.684 --> 30:35.752
I don't want to.

30:35.819 --> 30:38.254
Then don't.

PROTESTORS (chanting): Satan
is here, but God is near!

31:26.003 --> 31:28.137
Satan is here, but God is near!

31:28.205 --> 31:29.906
- Satan is here, but God is near!
- You!

31:29.974 --> 31:31.641
I know you're behind this.

31:31.709 --> 31:32.841
Because I have seen you.

31:32.842 --> 31:34.711
I know what you really are.

31:34.778 --> 31:36.045
What I am is annoyed.

31:36.113 --> 31:37.780
Just let me go to my club

31:37.848 --> 31:38.982
and move along, please.

31:39.049 --> 31:41.718
I know these murders are your doing!

31:41.785 --> 31:43.252
I have no skeletons in my closet,

31:43.320 --> 31:45.855
which is more than can be
said for you nasty little humans.

31:45.923 --> 31:48.858
So come on, preacher
man, enough about me,

31:48.926 --> 31:51.127
let's talk about your
dark and nasties, shall we?

31:51.195 --> 31:54.564
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

31:54.632 --> 31:56.566
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

31:56.634 --> 31:58.468
Well, get in line.

31:58.535 --> 32:00.737
Yes, I wish...

32:00.804 --> 32:01.604
Yes.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.406
I never met you.

32:03.474 --> 32:05.241
It's like some kind of
collective amnesia.

32:05.309 --> 32:06.909
I mean, I walk
around this city of yours,

32:06.944 --> 32:08.878
solving its filthy little crimes,

32:08.946 --> 32:10.413
and this is the thanks I get?

32:10.481 --> 32:11.314
You're a murderer.

32:11.382 --> 32:12.315
A murderer!

32:12.950 --> 32:16.119
Stop blaming me!

32:17.821 --> 32:20.289
I should destroy you.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.091
- MAN: Hey, put him down!
- MALCOLM: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:22.159 --> 32:23.826
Easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:23.894 --> 32:26.195
This scumbag isn't worth it, all right?

32:26.263 --> 32:27.397
This isn't over.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.333
(chuckles)

32:30.401 --> 32:32.435
You come to have a go at me as well?

32:32.503 --> 32:33.436
Nah.

32:33.504 --> 32:34.704
Chloe thought you might need protection

32:34.772 --> 32:36.005
from freaks like that.

32:36.073 --> 32:38.207
What I want is a drink.

32:42.146 --> 32:43.946
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

32:44.014 --> 32:45.748
Earlier today, or three weeks ago,

32:45.816 --> 32:47.583
when you broke up with me in a text?

32:47.651 --> 32:49.519
Chloe, I know.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.654
I've been looking for a
way to explain things,

32:51.722 --> 32:53.890
but nothing makes sense.

32:53.957 --> 32:55.858
I will fix this, though, I promise.

32:55.926 --> 32:58.127
No more promises. I
just want to do our jobs.

32:59.430 --> 33:00.630
What's that?

33:00.698 --> 33:02.832
(siren wailing)

33:07.538 --> 33:09.472
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:15.946 --> 33:17.914
This definitely doesn't belong here.

33:17.981 --> 33:20.216
A monogrammed "M."

33:21.318 --> 33:22.648
Doesn't Lucifer wear cuff links?

33:35.331 --> 33:38.220
Realy? No prints, no skin cells?

33:38.287 --> 33:39.488
Nope. Dead end.

33:39.555 --> 33:41.490
Unless you want to check Lucifer's
closet for the match.

33:41.557 --> 33:42.524
Very funny.

33:42.592 --> 33:44.392
Yo, Decker, your partner's on TV.

33:44.460 --> 33:46.328
NEWSCASTER: A video went viral today

33:46.395 --> 33:48.630
after a fight erupted
on Hollywood Boulevard.

33:48.698 --> 33:51.299
Local club owner Lucifer Morningstar

33:51.367 --> 33:55.170
attacked Reverend Jacob
Williams when Williams claimed

33:55.238 --> 33:57.172
the businessman with the devilish name

33:57.240 --> 33:58.707
was actually involved

33:58.774 --> 34:01.676
in the Satanic murders
making recent headlines.

34:01.744 --> 34:03.278
Apparently, I'm not the only one.

34:03.346 --> 34:04.346
This is ridiculous.

34:04.413 --> 34:05.747
He didn't attack the guy.

34:05.815 --> 34:07.649
He was defending himself.

34:09.051 --> 34:10.719
Still hot.

34:12.021 --> 34:14.121
Sorry.

34:20.129 --> 34:21.362
The preacher.

34:21.429 --> 34:22.731
Preacher's wearing a cuff link.

34:22.797 --> 34:23.899
So what?

34:23.966 --> 34:25.065
A lot of guys do.

34:25.134 --> 34:26.034
One?

34:26.101 --> 34:27.601
With an "M"?

34:27.670 --> 34:28.803
DAN: No way.

34:28.871 --> 34:30.170
Oh...

34:30.239 --> 34:31.172
It's not an "M."

34:31.239 --> 34:33.909
It's a "W," for Williams.

34:33.976 --> 34:35.310
Come on, Dan, it makes sense.

34:35.378 --> 34:36.578
Who's gonna want to kill Satanists

34:36.646 --> 34:38.179
more than a religious zealot?

34:39.982 --> 34:41.016
We gotta find him.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.083
MALCOLM: Freakin' street preacher

34:43.152 --> 34:44.753
and his little minions, man.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.855
Who do they think they are?

34:46.922 --> 34:49.858
Bunch of posers. (chuckles)

34:49.926 --> 34:50.859
Ah...

34:50.927 --> 34:52.327
Don't even sweat it, huh?

34:52.395 --> 34:55.630
What do you say we get some
ladies up in here, huh?

34:55.630 --> 34:56.731
Blow off some steam!

34:56.799 --> 34:58.466
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

34:58.534 --> 35:00.468
(chuckling)

35:03.940 --> 35:05.574
Why are you in my house?

35:06.475 --> 35:08.577
Because I got your back, man.

35:08.644 --> 35:11.813
I saw the way they
treated you at the crime scene.

35:11.881 --> 35:14.616
Anyways, I know you
didn't kill those people.

35:14.684 --> 35:16.084
Did you?

35:18.487 --> 35:21.790
(laughing) I'm just joking! God...

35:21.857 --> 35:24.626
You need to relax, get
yourself a little shiatsu.

35:24.694 --> 35:25.760
Mmm.

35:25.828 --> 35:27.629
Ah...

35:27.697 --> 35:28.730
This feels good.

35:28.798 --> 35:30.999
Feels good, hanging out here with you.

35:31.067 --> 35:34.269
I mean, ever since I, you
know, went to Hell, it's just...

35:34.337 --> 35:36.938
there's been things in my head

35:37.006 --> 35:39.441
that no one would understand.

35:41.077 --> 35:42.344
Except you, of course.

35:42.411 --> 35:44.379
You know?

35:44.447 --> 35:46.114
I just want you to know...

35:46.182 --> 35:48.950
I respect the hell out of you.

35:49.018 --> 35:50.385
(giggles)

35:50.453 --> 35:51.186
Get it?

35:51.253 --> 35:52.988
Hell? (laughs)

35:53.055 --> 35:54.422
Up top.

35:58.361 --> 36:00.562
What, you just gonna leave me hanging?

36:00.630 --> 36:03.031
You've got red paint on your hand.

36:03.099 --> 36:04.265
Huh?

36:04.333 --> 36:06.301
Just like the paint we
found at the warehouse.

36:06.369 --> 36:07.802
I must've gotten it on me at the scene.

36:07.870 --> 36:09.004
Oh, I doubt that.

36:09.071 --> 36:11.306
Everyone was wearing gloves.

36:18.447 --> 36:19.881
Aw, man!

36:19.949 --> 36:21.249
You caught me!

36:21.317 --> 36:23.051
Literally red-handed. (laughs)

36:23.119 --> 36:25.053
Oh, I was, I was wondering

36:25.121 --> 36:26.888
when you'd figure it out.

36:26.956 --> 36:29.724
You know, when I asked if you did it?

36:29.792 --> 36:32.160
Totally thought you were gonna ask me.

36:32.228 --> 36:34.362
Been dying all day to tell you.

36:34.430 --> 36:36.498
You?

36:36.565 --> 36:37.632
Uh-huh.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.600
You did this?

36:38.668 --> 36:40.001
You killed those people?

36:40.069 --> 36:41.838
Oh, you mean those frauds?

36:41.839 --> 36:42.437
Duh!

36:42.505 --> 36:43.985
So, what do you... what do you think?

36:44.006 --> 36:45.607
Impressed? Hmm?

36:45.675 --> 36:46.741
You're insane.

36:46.809 --> 36:48.076
I know! It's...

36:48.144 --> 36:49.244
Don't you love it?

36:49.311 --> 36:50.578
I mean, of course you do.

36:50.646 --> 36:51.713
I mean, we're the same.

36:51.781 --> 36:54.249
Oh, we are not the same.

36:54.316 --> 36:55.850
Wait, wait, wait.

36:55.918 --> 36:58.319
I-If you're worried,

36:58.387 --> 37:02.257
I've got the perfect
person to pin it on:

37:02.324 --> 37:03.792
that street preacher.

37:03.859 --> 37:05.060
Genius, right?

37:05.127 --> 37:06.327
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

37:06.395 --> 37:08.786
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

37:08.787 --> 37:10.298
Whoa!

37:10.366 --> 37:12.300
But I did this for you.

37:12.368 --> 37:13.268
Aren't you happy?

37:13.335 --> 37:15.370
Why would I be happy?

37:15.438 --> 37:17.539
I'm not evil. I punish evil.

37:17.606 --> 37:18.773
- Yeah, but, but you're, you know...
- The Devil, yes.

37:18.841 --> 37:20.141
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

37:20.209 --> 37:22.043
The whole world does.

37:22.111 --> 37:24.412
A torturer, maybe.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.182
An inflictor of just desserts, sure.

37:27.249 --> 37:29.684
But a senseless murderer I am not.

37:29.752 --> 37:32.454
Perhaps I need to clarify my position.

37:32.521 --> 37:33.855
Hey, hold on, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:33.923 --> 37:35.523
I've got this, remember?

37:35.591 --> 37:36.591
(laughs)

37:36.659 --> 37:37.926
Don't worry, Malcolm.

37:37.993 --> 37:39.427
I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

37:39.495 --> 37:42.297
I'm going to bring it right to you.

37:44.133 --> 37:45.800
And after I'm finished with you,

37:45.868 --> 37:47.202
Detective Decker can put you

37:47.269 --> 37:48.536
in a cold, dark room

37:48.604 --> 37:50.604
so you can think about what
you've done, young man.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.374
Oh...

37:53.442 --> 37:54.442
(both laughing)

37:57.012 --> 37:58.413
(whimpering)

37:58.481 --> 37:59.914
Ah!

37:59.982 --> 38:02.524
AMENADIEL: Why don't you
pick on someone your own size?

38:14.556 --> 38:18.190
After the
monumentally dreadful day I've had,

38:18.191 --> 38:20.098
you decide to drop in now?

38:20.166 --> 38:21.400
I'm clearing up your mess, by the way,

38:21.467 --> 38:22.534
so if you don't mind.

38:22.602 --> 38:24.536
You sent your demon to seduce me

38:24.604 --> 38:25.938
and then kill me.

38:26.005 --> 38:27.940
- (Lucifer chuckles)
- AMENADIEL: Yeah.

38:28.007 --> 38:30.208
I definitely mind.

38:32.345 --> 38:33.211
Right.

38:33.279 --> 38:34.079
Wonderful.

38:34.147 --> 38:35.447
Now look what you've done.

38:35.515 --> 38:37.149
The man you just freed...

38:37.216 --> 38:38.617
you know, the one you
raised from the dead...

38:38.685 --> 38:39.818
he's murdering humans.

38:39.886 --> 38:43.522
And that... that is
on your hands, brother.

38:43.589 --> 38:44.890
You're wrong.

38:44.958 --> 38:46.325
It's your fault.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.526
Oh...

38:47.593 --> 38:49.361
It always has been.

38:51.230 --> 38:52.564
Hate to break it to you, bro...

38:53.700 --> 38:54.700
(grunts)

38:54.767 --> 38:55.867
but this time, I'm fighting back.

38:55.935 --> 38:57.302
(grunting)

38:57.370 --> 38:59.671
If only you'd done what
was asked of you,

38:59.739 --> 39:00.939
none of this would've happened,

39:00.974 --> 39:02.641
and I'd still be home...

39:02.709 --> 39:03.909
(grunts)

39:03.977 --> 39:05.043
where I belong!

39:05.111 --> 39:08.046
Heaven? Really?

39:08.114 --> 39:09.648
You're sure that's still home, eh?

39:09.716 --> 39:11.450
After everything you've done?

39:13.252 --> 39:15.187
Sleeping with a demon.

39:15.254 --> 39:18.690
Think Dad might have another
assignment for you.

39:18.758 --> 39:21.226
Somewhere, I don't
know, slightly warmer.

39:22.228 --> 39:23.462
(yells)

39:29.435 --> 39:30.802
Why?

39:30.870 --> 39:32.704
Why did you have to use her?

39:32.772 --> 39:35.173
(laughs)

39:35.241 --> 39:38.243
Now I get what this
little tantrum's really about.

39:38.311 --> 39:40.045
It's about Maze.

39:40.113 --> 39:41.613
You like her.

39:41.681 --> 39:44.016
Well, I mean, I don't
blame you, brother.

39:44.083 --> 39:46.551
She is a wild woman in the sack.

39:52.158 --> 39:53.458
Listen, if you wanted me dead,

39:53.526 --> 39:55.861
you should've had the
balls to do it yourself!

39:57.764 --> 39:59.364
Oh, please.

39:59.432 --> 40:02.034
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

40:02.101 --> 40:03.568
Linda, Malcolm, huh?

40:03.636 --> 40:05.504
Now the detective.

40:07.073 --> 40:09.007
You're a coward!
- Chloe?

40:09.075 --> 40:11.710
I don't even know
what you're talking about!

40:11.778 --> 40:13.578
You always were a lousy liar.

40:19.252 --> 40:21.453
You justify it all, don't you?

40:21.521 --> 40:22.654
Claim it's all done

40:22.722 --> 40:24.956
in the name of our father,

40:25.024 --> 40:26.825
but...

40:26.893 --> 40:29.361
it's for your sake, brother.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.063
And they call me the prideful one.

40:31.130 --> 40:33.565
Enough!

40:33.633 --> 40:35.634
I'm the pawn.

40:35.701 --> 40:38.570
You both used me.

40:39.073 --> 40:41.007
You know what?

40:41.075 --> 40:42.008
Here.

40:44.078 --> 40:45.978
Kill each other.

41:00.227 --> 41:01.928
(sighs)

41:03.163 --> 41:05.798
Now where do I get a drink?

41:05.866 --> 41:08.234
The last place the
preacher was seen was near LUX.

41:08.302 --> 41:11.337
Remember, he's to be
considered armed and dangerous.

41:11.405 --> 41:12.872
Malcolm took Lucifer into the club.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.474
You guys see
anything, you get on the radio.

41:14.541 --> 41:15.541
All right, I'll check the club.

41:15.609 --> 41:16.809
You guys search the area.

41:16.877 --> 41:19.145
♪ ♪

41:19.213 --> 41:22.448
♪ I was looking for you ♪

41:25.853 --> 41:29.489

- Mmm.

41:29.556 --> 41:31.691
Hello, Detective.

41:31.758 --> 41:33.459
If you've come to have a
shot at me, now's the time.

41:33.527 --> 41:35.661
Everyone's doing it.

41:36.763 --> 41:39.198
Yeah, your scuffle with the preacher

41:39.266 --> 41:40.766
made the local news.

41:40.834 --> 41:41.767
(laughs)

41:41.835 --> 41:42.969
Oh, that.

41:43.036 --> 41:45.304
That was about five disasters ago.

41:45.372 --> 41:47.373
God, your face...

41:47.441 --> 41:48.608
Yeah, well, what can I say?

41:48.675 --> 41:50.343
You should've seen the other chap.

41:50.410 --> 41:51.777
Thought I did.

41:51.845 --> 41:52.912
What happened?

41:52.980 --> 41:55.214
(scoffs) Well...

41:55.282 --> 41:56.849
where do I begin?

41:56.917 --> 42:00.686
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

42:00.754 --> 42:02.688
Or perhaps the far more agonizing

42:02.756 --> 42:04.624
punishment that followed?

42:06.093 --> 42:07.293
To be blamed for every

42:07.361 --> 42:10.630
morsel of evil humanity's endured,

42:10.697 --> 42:13.399
every atrocity committed in my name?

42:13.467 --> 42:15.568
♪ Trying to impress you ♪

42:15.636 --> 42:20.139
As though I wanted people to suffer.

42:20.207 --> 42:22.475
All I ever wanted

42:22.543 --> 42:24.877
was to be my own man here.

42:24.945 --> 42:27.847
To be judged for my own doing.

42:27.915 --> 42:29.148
And for that?

42:30.484 --> 42:32.552
I've been shown how
truly powerless I am.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.455
That even the people I trusted...

42:36.523 --> 42:38.457
the one person, you...

42:38.525 --> 42:41.060
(sighs sadly)

42:41.128 --> 42:43.062
could be used to hurt me.

42:44.131 --> 42:45.064
Lucifer...

42:45.132 --> 42:47.366
Yes?

42:53.440 --> 42:55.474
(laughing) What?

42:55.542 --> 42:57.410
Put your hands up and
move away from the bar.

43:03.550 --> 43:05.084
Detective, there's an explanation...

43:05.152 --> 43:06.085
Stop!

43:06.153 --> 43:07.153
Don't say another word.

43:07.221 --> 43:08.154
Put your hands up.

43:10.824 --> 43:12.491
Or you'll leave us no choice.

43:14.161 --> 43:16.963
Lucifer
Morningstar, you're under arrest.
