WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:06.623
Item 28:
your pet name for me.

00:06.625 --> 00:08.992
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

00:08.994 --> 00:11.878
I submitted you
a notarized list.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.965
I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and
"Flakey" are not acceptable.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.701
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob""

00:17.703 --> 00:21.271
you don't like "Fester"-- you're
just impossible to please.

00:21.273 --> 00:22.789
We'll come back to that one.

00:22.791 --> 00:24.508
This brings us
to the final item

00:24.510 --> 00:27.010
in our annual State
of the Relationship Summit.

00:27.012 --> 00:29.780
Item 29: Valentine's Day.

00:29.782 --> 00:32.933
Ah, the worst for last. Hmm.

00:34.018 --> 00:36.103
Classic Flakey.

00:36.105 --> 00:39.856
Before you get upset, I believe
I've come up with a way for us

00:39.858 --> 00:42.225
to celebrate the occasion
that we both can enjoy.

00:42.227 --> 00:44.744
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

00:44.746 --> 00:47.531
but you go ahead--
end with one.

00:47.533 --> 00:50.317
I propose we spend a weekend

00:50.319 --> 00:52.352
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

00:52.354 --> 00:55.739
I hate every word
in that sentence.

00:56.874 --> 00:59.926
Including "in""
"at," "we" and "a""

00:59.928 --> 01:01.995
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

01:01.997 --> 01:04.664
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

01:04.666 --> 01:07.083
to eat with strangers
at your table.

01:07.085 --> 01:08.201
One step ahead of you--

01:08.203 --> 01:09.970
Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

01:09.972 --> 01:11.054
Oh, very well.

01:11.056 --> 01:12.339
What are the
sleeping arrangements?

01:12.341 --> 01:15.175
We've only been dating
for three years.

01:15.177 --> 01:19.246
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

01:19.248 --> 01:20.647
I got you your own room.

01:20.649 --> 01:22.318
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

01:22.319 --> 01:25.872
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like
you're bathing inside a monster.

01:26.605 --> 01:28.888
Look, I appreciate the effort,

01:28.890 --> 01:31.224
but I'm still
unclear how this trip

01:31.226 --> 01:33.076
is supposed to be
enjoyable for me.

01:33.078 --> 01:36.079
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

01:36.081 --> 01:38.932
on a fully functioning
vintage train.

01:38.934 --> 01:41.234
Vintage?

01:41.236 --> 01:42.936
Be specific.

01:42.938 --> 01:45.172
An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive

01:45.174 --> 01:47.374
leading a train
of meticulously restored

01:47.376 --> 01:50.093
1915 Pullman
first-class coaches.

01:50.095 --> 01:52.846
Wow.

01:53.631 --> 01:55.682
I'm feeling the
urge to hug you.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.852
And one... and two...

01:58.854 --> 02:00.937
All right, Gollum,
we're good.

02:31.656 --> 02:33.707
Are you sure you guys don't want
to come with us to Napa?

02:33.709 --> 02:35.125
You could probably
still get a room.

02:35.127 --> 02:37.711
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

02:37.713 --> 02:39.212
Plus, I'm not sure
it's a great idea

02:39.214 --> 02:41.781
to take Penny to where wine
comes from.

02:43.885 --> 02:45.552
What? It's a joke.

02:45.554 --> 02:47.954
Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

02:47.956 --> 02:50.307
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem--

02:50.309 --> 02:52.926
it's all for laughs.

02:52.928 --> 02:56.847
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

02:59.934 --> 03:03.186
Howard, which pocket watch
will you be wearing

03:03.188 --> 03:04.855
for dinner on the train?

03:10.094 --> 03:12.662
I'm sorry, what?

03:12.664 --> 03:14.831
Oh, I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

03:14.833 --> 03:17.367
it will be embarrassing.

03:17.369 --> 03:21.121
I don't own a pocket watch.

03:21.123 --> 03:23.323
Oh, my.

03:23.325 --> 03:27.210
Well, then my apologies for
bringing up this sore spot.

03:30.464 --> 03:32.632
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

03:32.634 --> 03:34.000
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

03:34.002 --> 03:36.219
You have Valentine's plans?!

03:36.221 --> 03:39.172
Which came out sounding
way more surprised than I meant.

03:40.107 --> 03:41.775
L-Let me try that again.
You have Val...

03:41.777 --> 03:43.560
See? I can't do it.

03:44.845 --> 03:47.147
I don't have plans
which is why I booked time

03:47.149 --> 03:48.982
on the big telescope that night.

03:48.984 --> 03:50.533
Well, an evening
looking at the stars--

03:50.535 --> 03:52.035
that's still
kind of romantic.

03:52.037 --> 03:53.486
Except I'll be alone.
I'm trying to put

03:53.488 --> 03:56.406
lipstick on a pig here.
Work with me.

03:57.491 --> 03:59.859
We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Yeah.

03:59.861 --> 04:01.711
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

04:01.713 --> 04:03.863
to see some action, so if
you guys happen to have sex,

04:03.865 --> 04:05.916
it's cool if she stays
in the room.

04:06.817 --> 04:09.469
Hey, same goes for the two
of you with Amy.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:21.649 --> 04:23.566
What do you think,
Sheldon?

04:23.568 --> 04:25.902
It's magnificent.

04:25.904 --> 04:28.605
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

04:28.607 --> 04:30.106
I'm so glad you like it.

04:30.108 --> 04:31.441
I'm prepared to say

04:31.443 --> 04:35.495
I love it, as soon as I confirm
there are no hobos aboard.

04:38.332 --> 04:39.833
Okay.

04:41.669 --> 04:43.286
Raj, I got it.

04:43.288 --> 04:44.788
Bye.

04:46.424 --> 04:48.458
That was your daddy.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.264
He wanted me to say that he
misses... Why am I doing this?

04:54.266 --> 04:56.850
Happy Valentine's Day!

04:56.852 --> 04:58.885
Ooh, flowers <i>and</i> chocolates?

04:58.887 --> 05:02.305
Somebody's trying to get
me out of my panties.

05:02.307 --> 05:05.141
Don't be surprised if you find
five chocolates missing

05:05.143 --> 05:07.694
and three gross coconut ones
with a bite taken out.

05:08.729 --> 05:11.231
It came that way
when I bought it.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.066
Got you a little
something, too.

05:13.068 --> 05:14.317
Aw.

05:14.319 --> 05:16.286
Jewelry.

05:16.288 --> 05:18.204
Oh, my God.

05:18.206 --> 05:19.873
Lakers tickets?!

05:22.444 --> 05:24.127
It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

05:24.129 --> 05:25.795
who will actually enjoy it.
Aw!

05:25.797 --> 05:29.282
You are the best boyfriend ever.

05:29.284 --> 05:31.801
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.390
Should we take this
little party to the bedroom?

05:37.392 --> 05:39.726
Mm, don't have to-- we have
the whole place to ourselves.

05:39.728 --> 05:42.128
Oh, that's true.
In fact, if you want,

05:42.130 --> 05:44.214
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

05:46.734 --> 05:50.887
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

05:50.889 --> 05:52.489
To the bedroom!

05:52.491 --> 05:53.656
Yeah!

05:58.696 --> 06:02.165
And for the entrée, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.199
Do you have any questions?

06:03.201 --> 06:04.617
Uh, I do.

06:04.619 --> 06:08.338
Uh, does this train car have the
original link-and-pin coupler

06:08.340 --> 06:10.874
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

06:11.842 --> 06:13.927
I'm sorry, I meant questions
about the food.

06:13.929 --> 06:15.762
Oh, of course. Um...

06:15.764 --> 06:18.548
he seafood risotto
being served on a train car

06:18.550 --> 06:20.266
with the original
link-and-pin coupler

06:20.268 --> 06:22.268
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

06:24.004 --> 06:26.056
I-I think we're
gonna need a minute.

06:27.274 --> 06:30.477
Fun fact: it's neither.

06:31.479 --> 06:32.679
They actually

06:32.681 --> 06:34.981
use the AAR type E coupler.

06:34.983 --> 06:37.683
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

06:37.685 --> 06:40.737
you'll hear the characteristic
click-pshht-thunk

06:40.739 --> 06:42.956
of the knuckle.

06:44.909 --> 06:47.410
Get out of town.

06:48.412 --> 06:52.031
Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.370
Hey, Cinnamon,

06:57.372 --> 07:00.039
guess who just did it
human style.

07:01.392 --> 07:03.042
Oh, my God!

07:03.044 --> 07:05.311
It's a little late,
but I'll take it.

07:05.313 --> 07:08.064
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.

07:08.066 --> 07:09.983
That's really bad for dogs.

07:09.985 --> 07:12.235
Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
We gotta get her

07:12.237 --> 07:14.687
to a vet right now.
I don't have a vet.

07:14.689 --> 07:17.690
I have a podiatrist,
an optometrist, an allergist,

07:17.692 --> 07:21.528
a dermatologist, a urologist.
You'd think I'd have a vet.

07:21.530 --> 07:23.079
Okay. There's one not far
from here. Come on. Let's go.

07:23.081 --> 07:24.897
Okay.
Koothrappali was right.

07:24.899 --> 07:27.250
We should have
let her watch.

07:30.237 --> 07:32.122
Do another one,
do another one!

07:32.124 --> 07:33.439
Okay.

07:33.441 --> 07:35.041
Here's my impression
of the Amtrak

07:35.043 --> 07:37.927
Acela barreling
down the Eastern Corridor.

07:45.603 --> 07:49.205
It's like there's a train
in your mouth.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.857
Oh, yeah.

07:50.859 --> 07:53.776
I've got one.
Um, the Amtrak Wolverine

07:53.778 --> 07:55.979
coming into Chicago.

08:04.371 --> 08:05.989
I've been on that train.

08:05.991 --> 08:08.374
And I just was again.

08:10.161 --> 08:11.461
Hey, see if you guys
can guess this one.

08:11.463 --> 08:14.247
Bang! Splat! Thud.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.418
How many trains
have you been on?

08:18.420 --> 08:21.971
Tons. A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

08:21.973 --> 08:25.275
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.345
Wow. Your life's amazing.

08:29.347 --> 08:31.231
Not always.

08:31.233 --> 08:34.433
A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

08:34.436 --> 08:37.904
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

08:42.142 --> 08:44.410
Why do I even try?

08:44.412 --> 08:46.029
I'm gonna fix
this right now.

08:46.031 --> 08:49.582
Okay. Just make it look
like an accident.

08:51.485 --> 08:53.536
Excuse me.
You are

08:53.538 --> 08:55.371
at Valentine's dinner
with your girlfriend.

08:55.373 --> 08:57.590
Now get back over there
and be with her.

08:58.826 --> 09:00.326
You're right.

09:00.328 --> 09:02.662
That was
insensitive of me.

09:02.664 --> 09:04.764
I have to go back
to my table now.

09:04.766 --> 09:06.099
You should join us.

09:06.101 --> 09:07.350
All right.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.803
Great.

09:10.805 --> 09:13.005
Now there's two of 'em.

09:22.151 --> 09:24.569
How much chocolate
did she eat?

09:24.571 --> 09:26.187
A whole box.
Well, to be fair,

09:26.189 --> 09:29.290
you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

09:29.292 --> 09:31.676
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

09:33.413 --> 09:35.447
I'm sorry,
is this a joke to you?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.398
No.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.584
Maybe to her.

09:41.871 --> 09:43.438
How big
a box of chocolate was it?

09:43.440 --> 09:44.956
Uh, something like
this. I don't know.

09:44.958 --> 09:47.959
It came free with
a full tank of gas.

09:47.961 --> 09:50.428
Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

09:50.430 --> 09:51.863
Do you know
how much gas is?

09:51.865 --> 09:52.714
Hey!

09:52.716 --> 09:55.433
Sorry.
Sorry.

09:55.435 --> 09:59.086
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you okay?!

09:59.088 --> 10:00.355
I can't believe you two!

10:00.357 --> 10:02.140
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.425
If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

10:04.427 --> 10:06.427
and scrap them for parts!

10:06.429 --> 10:08.763
You're the owner?

10:08.765 --> 10:10.615
Owner, father, soul mate,

10:10.617 --> 10:13.952
and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

10:15.905 --> 10:17.922
Well, she's not
throwing up,

10:17.924 --> 10:19.207
which is a good sign.

10:19.209 --> 10:21.543
So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

10:21.545 --> 10:23.244
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

10:23.246 --> 10:24.829
Okay?
Okay. Okay, thank you.

10:24.831 --> 10:26.764
Oh, if she's scared,
you can sing to her.

10:26.766 --> 10:28.783
She likes Katy Perry.

10:28.785 --> 10:29.951
Oh, but don't
do "Firework""

10:29.953 --> 10:31.786
That gets her all riled up.

10:31.788 --> 10:33.404
Got it.

10:33.406 --> 10:35.640
Should have been a dentist.

10:37.810 --> 10:40.645
Okay, what was
the best four-ten-four

10:40.647 --> 10:42.296
U.S. locomotive
ever built?

10:42.298 --> 10:44.632
Trick question.
There never was one.

10:44.634 --> 10:45.850
Or was there?

10:45.852 --> 10:48.069
What?!

10:49.355 --> 10:53.091
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

10:53.093 --> 10:54.943
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

10:54.945 --> 10:56.811
solving the problem
of the Q-1,

10:56.813 --> 10:58.963
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

10:58.965 --> 11:00.415
In what world is

11:00.417 --> 11:02.834
a four-four-six-four
a four-ten-four?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.586
A world I don't
want to live in!

11:05.955 --> 11:08.473
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

11:08.475 --> 11:11.259
Hold on to your
conductor's hat.

11:11.261 --> 11:13.127
You crank the second
and third axles,

11:13.129 --> 11:15.513
creating a pair
of internal connecting rods,

11:15.515 --> 11:17.164
and boom--
four-ten-four.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.100
If you think
about it, the Q-2

11:19.102 --> 11:21.269
was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

11:21.271 --> 11:23.955
I may never <i>stop</i>
thinking about it.

11:23.957 --> 11:26.624
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

11:26.626 --> 11:28.175
Better than you think.

11:31.363 --> 11:32.680
You know, if you ask nicely,

11:32.682 --> 11:34.282
they'll let you visit
the engine room.

11:35.518 --> 11:37.118
I never want
this day to end.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.171
It's feeling like
it never will.

11:40.173 --> 11:41.456
Come on.

11:42.541 --> 11:45.660
Hey, did I tell you
what happened to me at UPS?

11:48.797 --> 11:52.483
As if Valentine’s Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

11:52.485 --> 11:54.719
And with cheap chocolate,
no less?

11:54.721 --> 11:56.221
It wasn't cheap.

11:56.223 --> 11:58.223
It was free.

11:58.225 --> 12:00.091
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

12:00.093 --> 12:02.493
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

12:02.495 --> 12:05.230
Oh, no, come on.
It was a while.

12:05.232 --> 12:07.649
It was a while.

12:10.552 --> 12:12.070
Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?

12:12.072 --> 12:13.387
She's responding well.

12:13.389 --> 12:16.090
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

12:16.092 --> 12:18.409
All right. Uh, would-would
it be okay for me to see her?

12:18.411 --> 12:19.777
We're usually
in bed by now,

12:19.779 --> 12:22.313
and I want her to
know that I'm here.

12:22.315 --> 12:25.416
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.837
It's okay.
I sleep with my dog, too.

12:29.839 --> 12:32.457
We're not supposed
to let people in back,

12:32.459 --> 12:34.809
but I think
I can make an exception.

12:34.811 --> 12:36.410
Thank you.
Come on.

12:36.412 --> 12:39.430
By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
Oh, yeah?

12:39.432 --> 12:40.932
And I don't care

12:40.934 --> 12:42.934
what that obnoxious
parrot back there says.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.103
I crushed it.

12:45.105 --> 12:48.022
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

12:48.024 --> 12:50.925
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

12:50.927 --> 12:53.695
so what do you know?

12:59.318 --> 13:00.685
You okay?

13:00.687 --> 13:03.621
Why? Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo

13:03.623 --> 13:05.657
with some weirdo?

13:05.659 --> 13:09.927
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

13:09.929 --> 13:13.114
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

13:13.116 --> 13:16.617
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

13:16.619 --> 13:19.554
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

13:19.556 --> 13:23.308
I'm going to the Lego store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

13:25.394 --> 13:27.312
See? It's not
just Sheldon.

13:27.314 --> 13:30.581
They're all idiots.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.433
She's right.

13:32.435 --> 13:33.868
So, your boyfriend's

13:33.870 --> 13:35.069
a fixer-upper.

13:35.071 --> 13:36.237
Most of them are.

13:36.239 --> 13:37.405
I mean, look at this guy.

13:37.407 --> 13:38.606
You think he
came like this?

13:38.608 --> 13:41.075
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

13:42.628 --> 13:44.579
Now, he's been to space.

13:44.581 --> 13:46.864
That's all me.

13:48.283 --> 13:50.351
I had a little
to do with it.

13:50.353 --> 13:52.003
Oh, sure you did.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.822
Who's Mama's
big space man?

13:55.991 --> 13:58.659
I am.

14:04.499 --> 14:06.751
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

14:06.753 --> 14:09.854
Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

14:13.942 --> 14:16.194
How long should we stay?
I don't know.

14:16.196 --> 14:17.278
I'm kind of hungry.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.147
I saw a Thai place next door.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.865
Oh. Okay.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.700
Oh. Oh. Hey!
How's she doing?

14:22.702 --> 14:25.019
How is everything?
Yeah.

14:25.021 --> 14:27.138
She's gonna be okay; they're
gonna let me take her home.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.339
Oh, good.
So I want you

14:28.341 --> 14:29.707
to keep a close eye on her

14:29.709 --> 14:30.858
for the next 24 hours.

14:30.860 --> 14:33.444
Here are a few warning signs
to look out for,

14:33.446 --> 14:36.066
and if you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

14:36.067 --> 14:36.677
Oh.

14:36.683 --> 14:39.200
Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

14:39.202 --> 14:41.352
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

14:41.354 --> 14:43.154
Yes, thank you
for all your help.

14:43.156 --> 14:44.305
Yeah. I'm sorry if
you didn't think

14:44.307 --> 14:45.539
we were taking
it seriously.

14:45.541 --> 14:46.657
We love animals.

14:46.659 --> 14:48.142
Oh, do you guys own any pets?

14:48.144 --> 14:49.060
No.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.512
Good.

14:56.935 --> 14:59.236
I love you so much.

14:59.238 --> 15:01.438
I love you, too.

15:09.864 --> 15:12.383
Sorry.
Sorry.

15:12.385 --> 15:14.118
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

15:14.120 --> 15:18.122
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

15:19.708 --> 15:20.708
It was crazy.

15:20.710 --> 15:23.910
Dare I say "loco"?

15:23.912 --> 15:25.429
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

15:25.431 --> 15:27.631
The conductor said
as soon as he gets off work,

15:27.633 --> 15:29.516
he can come back
to the bed and breakfast

15:29.518 --> 15:30.768
and play his banjo for us.

15:30.770 --> 15:34.588
Okay. I need to speak to
my boyfriend in private,

15:34.590 --> 15:36.089
like, right now.

15:36.091 --> 15:37.725
There's a car
with a glass roof.

15:37.727 --> 15:39.393
Want to go look
at the stars?

15:39.395 --> 15:40.761
Oh, that sounds
so romantic.

15:40.763 --> 15:43.063
Oh, give it a rest!

15:43.065 --> 15:45.282
Let's go.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.504
Why are you still here?

15:50.506 --> 15:52.089
Excuse me.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.941
I think you're being
a little rude.

15:53.943 --> 15:55.159
<i>I'm</i> being rude?

15:55.161 --> 15:56.910
You've been rude to me
this entire evening.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.746
How is that possible?

15:58.748 --> 16:02.116
I've hardly spoken to you
since we got on the train.

16:02.118 --> 16:05.753
I'm detecting a little friction
between you two,

16:05.755 --> 16:08.172
and I don't want
to be a third rail.

16:08.174 --> 16:10.607
Get it?

16:10.609 --> 16:12.726
I get it.

16:14.112 --> 16:15.312
Leave!

16:17.182 --> 16:19.600
What is your problem?

16:19.602 --> 16:20.851
It's Valentine's Day.

16:20.853 --> 16:22.936
We're supposed
to be having a romantic weekend.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.072
Oh, really? Because
I remember you saying

16:25.074 --> 16:27.941
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

16:27.943 --> 16:31.078
Did you mean that, or were you
just trying to trick me?

16:31.080 --> 16:33.330
Fine, it's true.

16:33.332 --> 16:35.249
I deserve romance,

16:35.251 --> 16:38.335
and I didn't know
how else to make it happen.

16:38.337 --> 16:42.373
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

16:42.375 --> 16:46.176
Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm.

16:46.178 --> 16:49.630
Grape juice that burns.

16:49.632 --> 16:52.349
Uh, now let's gaze
into each other's eyes, hmm?

16:52.351 --> 16:53.667
You blinked. I win.

16:53.669 --> 16:55.519
Sheldon...
Let's see. What's next?

16:55.521 --> 16:57.688
Oh, kissing's romantic.

17:14.406 --> 17:17.357
That was nice.

17:17.358 --> 17:19.960
Good.

17:22.830 --> 17:24.882
Um...

17:24.884 --> 17:28.635
the conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

17:28.637 --> 17:32.172
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

17:34.008 --> 17:36.176
Okay, have fun.

17:37.512 --> 17:39.513
Do you want to come with me?

17:39.515 --> 17:43.350
Really? I do.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.906
Hey, guys, wait up!

17:58.388 --> 18:00.339
There you go.

18:00.341 --> 18:03.976
All cozy wozy.

18:03.978 --> 18:08.881
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.019
Hmm. "Rajesh, I was dreading
Valentine's Day.

18:13.021 --> 18:16.823
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

18:18.609 --> 18:21.494
Cinnamon, she-she gave me
her phone number.

18:21.496 --> 18:23.446
If I knew it was that easy,

18:23.448 --> 18:26.182
I would have considered
poisoning you months ago.

18:28.068 --> 18:30.119
Oh, what should I say?

18:30.121 --> 18:32.705
Oh, I know. I'll point out
her name's Yvette,

18:32.707 --> 18:34.290
and that she's a vet.

18:34.292 --> 18:35.591
That's hysterical.

18:35.593 --> 18:37.093
She'll love it.

18:39.546 --> 18:41.964
Hello.
Oh, hey.

18:41.966 --> 18:44.717
You're back. How was your trip?
It was wonderful!

18:44.719 --> 18:45.685
Great. What did you do?

18:45.687 --> 18:47.220
I made a new friend

18:47.222 --> 18:49.272
who likes trains
as much as I do,

18:49.274 --> 18:51.140
uh, I kissed Amy on the lips,

18:51.142 --> 18:52.108
and, uh,

18:52.110 --> 18:53.442
the conductor played his banjo
for me.

18:53.444 --> 18:54.560
Good night.

18:54.562 --> 18:57.046
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.948
I'm gonna need
more details.

18:58.950 --> 19:01.534
Oh, well, my new friend's name
was Eric.

19:01.536 --> 19:05.288
Um, Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

19:05.290 --> 19:06.455
Oh...

19:06.457 --> 19:07.707
the banjo-playing conductor

19:07.709 --> 19:09.041
was missing a finger,

19:09.043 --> 19:11.244
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

19:11.246 --> 19:13.996
No, hang on.
Hang on.

19:13.998 --> 19:16.499
Are all those things
equal to you?

19:16.501 --> 19:18.467
Hmm.

19:18.469 --> 19:20.586
It never occurred to me
to pick a favorite.

19:20.588 --> 19:23.506
Well, give it a go.

19:23.508 --> 19:27.310
I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

19:28.312 --> 19:30.296
Additional data. You dog!

19:30.298 --> 19:32.098
I'm not sure how
listening to other

19:32.100 --> 19:35.017
nine-fingered banjo players
makes me dog, but all right.
