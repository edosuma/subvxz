07:02.672 --> 07:05.636
Look right, I didn't really want
to tell you this mate but...

07:05.638 --> 07:08.873
But Shitface said he saw her snogging
someone outside The Dolphin the other week.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.839

called Shitface okay, that's...

07:14.471 --> 07:15.903
Anyway me and Michelle,

07:15.905 --> 07:18.570

something amazing, something special.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.573
Yeah.

07:21.138 --> 07:22.502
She just dumped me.

07:22.504 --> 07:24.272
Oh, but she put a kiss at the
end, that's nice of her, innit?

07:26.339 --> 07:28.104
Who gives a fuck man?

07:28.106 --> 07:30.106
At least you got your end away,
got that monkey off your back, eh?

07:31.373 --> 07:32.372
Yep.

07:34.473 --> 07:35.973
You didn't do anything
with her, did ya?

07:37.804 --> 07:39.573
Three months
you were with her boss.

07:40.172 --> 07:42.739
We did stuff. Okay.

07:44.105 --> 07:46.139
Sexy stuff, all right
but just not,

07:46.939 --> 07:48.303

07:48.305 --> 07:50.173
What are you waiting for,
the honeymoon?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.172
Look.

07:54.206 --> 07:56.336
I've got this problem, okay?

07:56.338 --> 08:00.038
This thing it just happens
when I get close to...

08:00.040 --> 08:02.337
Look mate I go through exactly
the same thing, brother.

08:02.339 --> 08:04.204
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

08:04.206 --> 08:06.304
I take this thing
called Viagras,

08:06.306 --> 08:07.972
I swear to ya,
it's like a wrench man.

08:07.974 --> 08:11.171
No, idiot, it's not that.
That's fine.

08:11.173 --> 08:15.538
It's more of a sort of,
mental panic, thing.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.205
Right I said that to you
cause you're my pal

08:17.207 --> 08:18.571

you feel good man.

08:18.573 --> 08:19.574

08:21.007 --> 08:22.805
Good talk, thanks Alex.
I'm off.

08:22.807 --> 08:24.174

08:33.640 --> 08:36.272
And do I ever break promises?
No, I never do, do I?

08:36.274 --> 08:38.472
This is my present
to you, my brother.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.270

08:40.273 --> 08:41.972

08:52.307 --> 08:54.008

08:54.974 --> 08:56.504

08:56.506 --> 08:59.308
No Alex, I don't think that's
why they call you that... Shit.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.138
Right, we've got a crier.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.674
What did you say to her?

09:22.676 --> 09:25.008
It's not my fault, mate. She lost her
husband or something, I don't know.

09:25.674 --> 09:26.806
Really? That's terrible.

09:26.808 --> 09:28.173
That's why she's on her own.

09:28.175 --> 09:29.840
Fucking brilliant, innit?

09:29.842 --> 09:30.842

Jesus.

10:12.441 --> 10:13.542
Am I sexy?

10:14.108 --> 10:15.906
Of course, you are.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.707
Yes I am.

10:17.709 --> 10:18.807

10:30.010 --> 10:32.274
Shall we get you,

10:32.276 --> 10:34.474
- For sex?
- No, no, no, just get you home, yeah?

10:34.476 --> 10:35.574
Yeah?

10:35.576 --> 10:36.576
I feel a bit sick.

10:38.443 --> 10:41.877
Okay. Here we go,
here's the nice cab driver.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.108
Hello, mate.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.110
She all right?

10:49.477 --> 10:50.576
She's a bit tipsy.

10:52.477 --> 10:55.208
If that girl is sick in this
car, you're cleaning it up, pal.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.308
With your bare hands.

10:56.310 --> 10:58.343
- I've been sick.
- Yeah, it's all right. Cheers.

11:04.476 --> 11:05.577

11:09.744 --> 11:10.744
Wait, wait, oh, wait. Jesus.

11:11.476 --> 11:13.441
Here we go.

11:13.443 --> 11:14.510
A little sit down.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.176
Yeah, there we go.

11:19.644 --> 11:22.508
One step, two steps.

11:22.510 --> 11:23.510

11:25.177 --> 11:27.975

- No...

11:27.977 --> 11:31.110
Here it is, there it is.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.476
Come on, that's it!

11:36.977 --> 11:39.109
Sierra two nine.
Suspect in sight.

11:39.111 --> 11:41.478
Hi.

12:19.044 --> 12:20.144
Mama.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.978
Story checks out,
you're free to go.

12:34.446 --> 12:36.378
Just maybe stick to conscious
girls in the future, yeah?

12:39.479 --> 12:41.512
I will, thank you, Officer.

12:44.877 --> 12:46.277
<i>Right, so
what happened last night?</i>

12:46.279 --> 12:48.143
At least tell me you

12:48.145 --> 12:49.209
No.

12:49.211 --> 12:50.510
Why?

12:50.512 --> 12:51.847
She was crying.

12:53.913 --> 12:55.680
About the recent death
of her husband.

12:57.913 --> 12:59.080
She was going like this.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.713
Please,
please have sex with me.

13:05.378 --> 13:06.710
Is that a turn on for you?

13:06.712 --> 13:07.810
Little bit, yeah.

13:07.812 --> 13:11.813
Please, help me.

13:12.379 --> 13:14.211
That's what I'm gonna do.

13:14.213 --> 13:16.511
That's why we're here
doing this chat thing.

13:16.513 --> 13:18.676
All right, gays.
Mind if I join?

13:18.678 --> 13:20.111
Actually, Laura,
we're kinda of...

13:20.113 --> 13:22.344
So my boyfriend's band is playing this
gig tonight, you guys should come.

13:22.346 --> 13:24.644
Your boyfriend's in
a band called Crabs, eh?

13:24.646 --> 13:25.877
It's KRABS.

13:25.879 --> 13:28.210
Okay, well make sure he bags up
then by the sounds of things.

13:28.212 --> 13:30.177
Oh, well, actually,
we're not having sex.

13:30.179 --> 13:32.612
Oh for fucks sake.
Is everyone going mad?

13:32.614 --> 13:34.310
Uh, no, it's John's idea.

13:34.312 --> 13:37.712
Yeah, we're gonna wait until,
we really know each other.

13:37.714 --> 13:43.310
John is a modern, y'know sensitive,
intelligent, beautiful, artist.

13:43.312 --> 13:44.714
You know,
I think it's beautiful.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.681
- Ah, all right, Frankie.
- All right, Laura.

13:52.846 --> 13:53.880
Oh, hang on.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.977
Cheers.

13:57.979 --> 13:59.212
Jees!

13:59.214 --> 14:00.912
- Thanks nice one, mate.
- No worries, see you later.

14:00.914 --> 14:01.913
Laura?

14:04.281 --> 14:05.545
Oh, oh, do you want some?

14:05.547 --> 14:07.378
I've just spent
the night in jail.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.444
I wasn't really planning
on going back any time soon.

14:09.446 --> 14:11.712
Sexually assaulting a drunken widow,
terrible business, it really is.

14:11.714 --> 14:14.044
- That's not funny man.
- What?

14:14.046 --> 14:15.211
It's not his fault though, eh,

14:15.213 --> 14:16.512
that's what happens
when you go 29 years

14:16.514 --> 14:18.044
without so much as a woman
even sneezing on your dick.

14:18.046 --> 14:19.612
Alex! Will you shut...

14:19.614 --> 14:21.680
Oh, my God.
You're still a virgin!

14:21.682 --> 14:26.512
Okay. Thanks for a really lovely day.
I'm gonna go and kill myself.

14:26.514 --> 14:28.281
Oh, no, Jim. Jim, look,
look, listen.

15:04.648 --> 15:06.280
My God, did you see that?
They stared right at me.

15:06.282 --> 15:07.516
They keep staring
at you, mate.

15:09.682 --> 15:11.146
Oh, Jesus.
Oh God, oh God.

15:11.148 --> 15:13.147
Fuck it, this is your time,
this is your day.

15:13.149 --> 15:15.179
I'm gonna go through
the ABCs with you right now.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.246
You Act, you Blag
and you Check out.

15:17.248 --> 15:20.012
No matter how scared you are,
you force yourself up there.

15:20.014 --> 15:22.245
And you blag it,
you don't think you blag.

15:22.247 --> 15:23.546
You pretend
you're somebody else.

15:23.548 --> 15:26.179
Someone you've always wanted
to be like a spy or a fireman.

15:26.181 --> 15:29.245
You can be James fucking Bond I don't
give a shit. But you gotta blag it.

15:29.247 --> 15:31.914
Once you've got them on the
hook, that's when you check out.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.247
Don't stay there too long.

15:33.249 --> 15:35.180
It'll leave them
gagging for it.

15:35.182 --> 15:36.446
I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:36.448 --> 15:38.081
Sick with lust obviously.

15:40.149 --> 15:42.180
All right fuck it, I tell you what, you
get up there and you buy yourself a drink

15:42.182 --> 15:45.247
but make sure it's got ice in it. Get
one of the icicles out and you smash it.

15:45.249 --> 15:47.146
Once you've smashed it turn to the
girls and you go 'all right, girls, '

15:47.148 --> 15:48.346
and you go, <i>"Hola,</i> girls.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.513
"now that I've broken the
ice, can I buy you a drink?"

15:50.515 --> 15:51.681
Piece of piss off you pop.

15:51.683 --> 15:54.480
Literally no one has ever
fallen for that shit.

15:54.482 --> 15:55.847
Don't listen
to this fucking idiot.

15:55.849 --> 15:57.313
Works every time dude.

15:57.315 --> 15:59.381
They think they'll hate it but deep
inside themselves they love it trust me.

15:59.383 --> 16:02.849
Just wait this is a lot of information
to take in at once okay. So...

16:03.879 --> 16:04.847
Don't think, act.

16:04.849 --> 16:07.181
Hey, stop bullying him,
can't you see the boy is scared?

16:07.183 --> 16:11.317
I'm not a boy, Laura.
I'm, I'm a man.

16:17.348 --> 16:18.349
Oh, my God.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.450
Barman, can I have
a lemonade please?

16:41.849 --> 16:43.450
With ice! Sorry.

16:44.984 --> 16:45.983
Hi.

16:47.150 --> 16:48.150
Nice one, thanks.

16:49.849 --> 16:50.850
Jesus.

16:52.982 --> 16:54.649
Jesus Christ.

16:54.651 --> 16:55.851
Slippery.

16:59.982 --> 17:01.614
Shit! I'm so sorry!

17:01.616 --> 17:02.782
- Did that...
- That's...

17:02.784 --> 17:03.848
- ...hit you in the eye.
- That's fine...

17:03.850 --> 17:06.015
No. No, I'm fine.

17:06.017 --> 17:10.550
Okay well, uh,
now that I've smashed the ice... cube.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.881
Can I, can I buy you a drink?

17:13.883 --> 17:16.147
Um, we've already got drinks.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.781
Yes, you do.
What are you rocking there?

17:17.784 --> 17:19.215
Are you bleeding?

17:19.218 --> 17:21.647
Little bit. It's fine.
I'll just...

17:21.650 --> 17:23.482
Probably should have stamped
on it with my foot.

17:23.483 --> 17:24.549
Blag it!

17:24.550 --> 17:26.518
I spy on people.

17:27.983 --> 17:32.082
- Okay.
- Not. No, not like in a creepy way.

17:32.084 --> 17:36.783
More like, uh,
James Bond 007, thing.

17:36.785 --> 17:39.483
Ooh that's,
that's pretty cool.

17:39.485 --> 17:41.082
He's dying up there,
do something.

17:41.084 --> 17:42.182
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

17:42.184 --> 17:45.650
So, I'm gonna go,
I'm really busy.

17:45.652 --> 17:48.449
Spying and stuff...

17:48.451 --> 17:49.818
...talk to you later.

17:55.251 --> 17:56.719
My dog is heavy.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.786
You look like anglers.

18:01.318 --> 18:02.319
Oh, shit.

18:04.385 --> 18:07.850
Sorry.
My God in Heaven you look like angels.

18:07.852 --> 18:09.417
Well...

18:11.318 --> 18:14.686
Would you like to go out
for a fuck time in lotion?

18:17.053 --> 18:18.485
I'm bad at this.

18:20.151 --> 18:23.852
Fun! Sorry.
Fun time in London.

18:24.152 --> 18:25.518
Yeah.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.650
Yeah, yeah, we'd love to.
Wouldn't we?

18:28.652 --> 18:29.716
Yeah.

18:29.718 --> 18:31.716
You, love, what?

18:31.718 --> 18:34.019
Yeah, just, you know,
tell us when and where.

18:35.085 --> 18:36.817
Oh, good, brilliant.

18:37.885 --> 18:41.186
I'll just go and tell
my sexy friend over there.

18:42.419 --> 18:43.419
Hey.

18:44.418 --> 18:45.552
Walk away.

18:48.853 --> 18:51.818
Oh, that's for me.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.483
I'm gonna...
catch you in a bit.

18:54.485 --> 18:55.617
Okay.

18:55.619 --> 18:56.619
Bye.

19:04.087 --> 19:06.720
Breathe, breathe, breathe
ready for tonight then.

19:07.220 --> 19:08.652
I can't do it, mate.

19:09.187 --> 19:10.351
What?

19:10.353 --> 19:13.085
I'm
having a panic attack, mate.

19:13.087 --> 19:14.617
It doesn't make
any sense, does it?

19:14.619 --> 19:16.318
Why would these
two beautiful women

19:16.320 --> 19:18.220
just turn up out of the blue
and be interested in us?

19:19.718 --> 19:22.784
You've got to stop questioning
stuff all the time man, seriously.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.152
Sometimes a bit of luck
comes your way

19:24.154 --> 19:26.720
you've got to grab it with both
hands like it won't come round again.

19:27.653 --> 19:29.084
I'm going.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.085
- What are you running from?
- Jesus.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.785
These girls wanna
break our dicks off

19:32.787 --> 19:34.719
and you want to stay in here
with your finger up your bum bum.

19:34.721 --> 19:35.721
Come on, man.

19:37.786 --> 19:38.787
I'll do it.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.653
Kitty?

19:50.353 --> 19:51.353
Kit?

19:52.820 --> 19:54.252
Kitty?

19:59.552 --> 20:01.319
Kit, where are you?

20:08.954 --> 20:10.219
Kit?

20:14.688 --> 20:15.785
Kit?

20:29.022 --> 20:30.618
How did you do that?

20:38.687 --> 20:40.552
You all right, Lu?

20:40.554 --> 20:41.886
What was that all about?

20:44.254 --> 20:45.255
Nothing.

21:00.722 --> 21:02.319
Up here, Neil?

21:02.321 --> 21:05.019
Nice one matey,
see you soon.

21:06.555 --> 21:08.988
Are you ready for the
night of your fucking...

21:10.322 --> 21:11.322
What you doing?

21:13.154 --> 21:14.220
T-Rex.

21:14.222 --> 21:15.522
Almost finished.

21:18.421 --> 21:19.590
Fuck that off.
Come on.

21:22.122 --> 21:23.353
I'm not going.

21:23.355 --> 21:24.419
You what?

21:24.421 --> 21:25.989
They were clearly
taking the piss.

21:27.023 --> 21:28.187
What's going on now,

21:28.189 --> 21:29.721
what's happened to you?
Why've you had a change of heart?

21:29.723 --> 21:30.723
Girls like that don't...

21:34.788 --> 21:37.023
Maybe it's just not
meant to happen, okay.

21:38.656 --> 21:40.357
I've tried everything, mate.

21:41.190 --> 21:42.953
I even went on this...

21:42.955 --> 21:44.787
I even went
on this dating website

21:44.789 --> 21:47.854
specifically for virgins
and I got one response.

21:47.856 --> 21:49.723
From a 12-year-old
Chinese boy.

21:51.356 --> 21:52.356
Yeah.

21:54.590 --> 21:56.387
Look, boss,
I know you're scared.

21:56.389 --> 21:57.889
Do you want
to know a secret?

21:58.790 --> 22:00.221
We're all fucking scared, man

22:00.223 --> 22:02.520
and being a bloke is just
pretending that we're not.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.153
The only reason
why you're so afraid is

22:04.155 --> 22:05.388
because it's taken
you so long

22:05.390 --> 22:08.320
and you've made this fucking
mad weird mountain in your head.

22:08.322 --> 22:11.156
I'll climb it with you boss,
I'll come with ya. I'll be your Sherpa.

22:13.656 --> 22:15.854
What's that?
Put it down man.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.587
Put that fucking shit down, man.
Get here...

22:18.589 --> 22:19.721
What?

22:19.723 --> 22:22.021
Just look at yourself man.
Just look at yourself.

22:22.023 --> 22:24.888
Got a blemish-less pale face
like a Tudor lady.

22:24.890 --> 22:26.121
You've got a broad back.

22:26.123 --> 22:27.421
You've got wonderful titties...

22:27.423 --> 22:30.154
And you've got beautiful,
big ginger bollocks.

22:30.156 --> 22:32.956
- Fuck off!
- There's the smile I'm after!

22:32.958 --> 22:35.188
They're just girls, man.
What's there to be afraid of?

23:13.824 --> 23:15.388
Yeah!

23:15.390 --> 23:16.859
Wooo!

23:19.491 --> 23:20.692
See that?

23:30.591 --> 23:32.422
You do want to see
him again don't ya?

23:32.424 --> 23:33.755
Yeah,
of course I do.

23:33.757 --> 23:36.391
Well, you know
what we've got to do.

23:37.890 --> 23:39.559
Look, I know
you're scared, baby Lu.

23:40.692 --> 23:42.323
But we're so close now.

23:42.325 --> 23:45.825
Well, I know
that it's, it's just...

23:47.291 --> 23:48.490
Sometimes
you just get so...

23:48.492 --> 23:49.491
What?

23:50.325 --> 23:51.325
Nothing.

23:52.292 --> 23:53.960
You're a big girl now.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.326
He's not going to believe
how much you've grown up.

24:47.159 --> 24:48.160
Big night.

24:52.026 --> 24:53.657
Just think,

24:53.659 --> 24:56.191
in a few hours.

24:56.193 --> 24:59.658
Everything's going to be back
to the way it was before, yeah?

24:59.660 --> 25:02.493
Just the three of us,
all together again.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.161
Doesn't that sound good?

25:07.725 --> 25:10.158
You know, this will work.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.961
We've done
everything he taught us.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.524
You do trust me, don't you?

25:14.526 --> 25:15.591
Yeah.

25:15.593 --> 25:17.293
No, no,
of course I do.

25:23.959 --> 25:27.962
Come on then, Cinderella.
Let's get you to the ball!

25:32.428 --> 25:33.825
This is all
we've got to work with?

25:33.827 --> 25:37.725
All right, well,
so, corduroy.

25:37.727 --> 25:39.361
- Absolutely not.
- Okay.

25:55.494 --> 25:57.859
- That's nice.
- Sort of says to me, alcoholic,

25:57.861 --> 26:00.293
mid-fifties,
not having a great time.

26:00.295 --> 26:02.692
1980's skinhead.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.359
- Right.
- Slightly racist.

26:04.361 --> 26:06.960
Oh, hello,
oh, you know what?

26:06.962 --> 26:09.727
You look like a...
I don't know, you look like a beacon!

26:09.729 --> 26:11.392
- Yeah. No, that's, that's awful.
- It's really itchy,

26:11.394 --> 26:12.828
- Yeah, rid it, rid it.
- it's really, really itchy.

26:31.762 --> 26:33.658
Best of a bad bunch
here brother, so...

26:33.660 --> 26:35.329
- Burgundy really?
- Trust me.

26:36.894 --> 26:40.693
- Ahh! <i>Magnifique, Monsieur!</i>
- Yeah, man?

26:40.695 --> 26:41.760
- Yeah, man!
- Really?

26:41.762 --> 26:43.027
These are my work trousers.

26:43.029 --> 26:44.726
Don't matter
that's all we've got.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.293
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:46.295 --> 26:48.294
They feel a bit snug
around my bollocks.

26:48.296 --> 26:50.063
- Ooh. Shit!
- Ooh, yeah, baby!

27:22.597 --> 27:23.597
Syringe.

27:24.129 --> 27:25.129
Check.

27:25.997 --> 27:27.597
Breath.

27:28.296 --> 27:29.360
That's fine.

27:29.362 --> 27:30.363
Chloroform.

27:31.164 --> 27:32.164
Check.

27:33.397 --> 27:35.297
- Let's see if you've shaved your balls.
- Yes, I have.

27:36.329 --> 27:37.330
Knife.

27:39.029 --> 27:40.029
Check.

27:40.763 --> 27:41.763
Packed condoms.

27:42.563 --> 27:43.696
Already wearing mine.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.829
Okay,

27:46.564 --> 27:47.664
let's do this.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.194
Which one am I going for?

28:09.196 --> 28:10.560
Whichever one
you want, boss,

28:10.562 --> 28:12.061
it's your night.
I'm just a wingman.

28:12.063 --> 28:14.694
Remember
you're a sexy bastard.

28:14.696 --> 28:15.961
Right, here they come.

28:15.963 --> 28:18.695
Remember, crank up the sexiness
straight from the start.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.997
Yeah, we don't have
time to fuck about.

28:20.696 --> 28:22.064
You're a sexy bitch.

28:22.563 --> 28:23.828
What are you?

28:23.830 --> 28:25.161
Sexy bitch?

28:25.163 --> 28:26.164
Good.

28:27.662 --> 28:28.927
Ladies.

28:28.929 --> 28:32.894
Hey, boys.
Ready to paint the town red?

28:32.896 --> 28:34.931
Yes, we flipping well
are, aren't we, Jim?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.565
Yeah, big style.

28:39.331 --> 28:40.695
Do you want a drink?

28:40.697 --> 28:42.165
Yeah,
I'll come with ya.

28:44.898 --> 28:45.898
Take a seat.

28:49.697 --> 28:50.698
Take a seat.

29:15.998 --> 29:17.229
So, you're sisters then?

29:17.231 --> 29:19.731
Yeah, sorry,
yeah, yeah.

29:20.731 --> 29:21.732
Cool,

29:22.932 --> 29:24.098
that's cool.

29:31.897 --> 29:34.497
I like your necklace thing,
it looks like the moon.

29:34.499 --> 29:37.696
Oh, thank you.
It was my mum's.

29:37.698 --> 29:40.097
Hmm. She doesn't want
it back then?

29:40.099 --> 29:41.196
She's dead.

29:41.198 --> 29:42.198
Right.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.033
Sorry.

29:50.631 --> 29:52.032
Service please,
Miss Danielle.

29:53.199 --> 29:54.663
Oh, here's trouble.

29:54.665 --> 29:55.930
How are you doing,
beautiful? You good?

29:55.932 --> 29:58.496
All right, you need
to behave yourself tonight.

29:58.498 --> 30:00.563
Two pints of lager please
and white wine spritzers.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.030
Um, cranberry juice.

30:02.032 --> 30:03.032
With vodka, please.

30:03.531 --> 30:05.334
No, we don't drink.

30:09.466 --> 30:10.531
What?

30:10.533 --> 30:11.831
We have run into
a serious issue here.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.733
- What have you done now?
- The girls don't drink.

30:14.666 --> 30:16.031
And?

30:16.033 --> 30:17.567
Right how do
I put this nicely?

30:18.399 --> 30:20.099
No one's going
to fuck you sober.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.665
That's you putting it
nicely, is it?

30:24.667 --> 30:25.734
I've got an idea.

30:26.766 --> 30:28.098
What about the friend?

30:28.100 --> 30:29.330
How are we
gonna get rid of him?

30:29.332 --> 30:30.631
I'm working on it.

30:30.633 --> 30:33.398
You just focus on Jim and don't
let him out of your sight.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.698
Ladies,

30:34.700 --> 30:35.833
ever heard of KRABS?

31:03.366 --> 31:05.732
This is the guy I was telling you
about, this is John.

31:05.734 --> 31:07.499
- How you doing, John, pleased to meet you, mate.
- Yeah nice to meet you, bruv.

31:07.501 --> 31:08.999
That's incredible
it really was.

31:11.366 --> 31:12.833
Best we've ever done it.

31:12.835 --> 31:16.365
Yeah it was all right,
just lost the tempo at the end there

31:16.367 --> 31:18.368
but we will get it right,
at some point.

31:20.702 --> 31:25.534
Fuck you, John.
I quit! The KRABS are over!

31:26.533 --> 31:28.699
No. The KRABS
are never over, bruv.

31:28.701 --> 31:30.531
I hope that they're not.

31:30.533 --> 31:32.565
Have you got them beans?

31:32.567 --> 31:34.733
Yep. Um, just be careful with
them 'cause they're quite strong.

31:34.735 --> 31:37.200
- Okay.
- Ah, forget that shit I've got something for you right here.

31:37.202 --> 31:40.232
New album <i>Mopy Symphlex.</i>
Do you a deal, fiver.

31:40.234 --> 31:42.168
- No, I'm all right. Thank you, mate.
- Please,

31:43.035 --> 31:44.366
take one.

31:44.368 --> 31:45.702
Okay, no problem.

31:46.502 --> 31:48.536
Have you ever heard
an owl cry?

31:50.934 --> 31:52.799
No, I haven't, mate. No.

31:55.868 --> 31:59.166
Thanks, boss, thank you
very much, cheers.

31:59.168 --> 32:01.499

32:01.501 --> 32:03.068

32:04.235 --> 32:06.034
So, you like, uh,
cranberry juice.

32:06.368 --> 32:07.666
Yeah.

32:07.668 --> 32:10.336
Isn't that, isn't it good
for period pains?

32:10.836 --> 32:12.198
What?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.533
My sister told me
it was good

32:13.535 --> 32:15.268
for period pains
cranberry juice, no?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.070
Someone told me that.

32:19.167 --> 32:20.468
I don't know.

32:23.036 --> 32:25.033
No, that's it potassium,
potassium.

32:25.035 --> 32:26.733
It's like a bloody
funeral in here innit?

32:26.735 --> 32:29.200
Let's smash these and go somewhere
else, I know just the place.

32:29.202 --> 32:30.499
There you take
that one ducky.

32:30.501 --> 32:31.668
- Thank you.
- For you.

32:35.902 --> 32:37.901
Uh... sorry.

32:37.903 --> 32:39.700
Oh, shit.

32:39.702 --> 32:42.734
I thought,
there was a moth in that.

32:42.736 --> 32:45.000
I, there was definitely
a moth in that one.

32:45.002 --> 32:47.533
We're gonna go,
I'll get you another one.

32:47.535 --> 32:49.799
- Okay.
- That cost frigging money that.

32:53.468 --> 32:55.233
Where am I gonna get
some more from now?

32:55.235 --> 32:56.634
We're not doing
that, are we?

32:56.636 --> 32:59.867
- Why on earth not?
- Because it's, illegal, for one.

32:59.869 --> 33:02.367
Under whose eyes?
Eyes of the Lord?

33:19.368 --> 33:21.400
Just a cranberry juice
then please, mate.

33:21.402 --> 33:23.801
Thank you for cranberry
juice, cranberry juice.

33:23.803 --> 33:24.803
Cheers!

33:58.337 --> 33:59.401
Do you wanna dance?

33:59.403 --> 34:01.334
No, no way.

34:01.336 --> 34:02.634
Why not?

34:02.636 --> 34:06.367
I just I, I don't. Last time I
danced I was 10 years old at the...

34:06.369 --> 34:09.469
school disco and I accidentally
elbowed Natalie Cork in the face.

34:09.471 --> 34:10.936
You can't be that bad.

34:10.938 --> 34:12.034
I am.

34:12.036 --> 34:13.936
I look like I am being
beaten up by ghosts.

34:27.505 --> 34:28.505
Sorry.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.101
Oh, shit.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.203
What is it?

34:34.205 --> 34:36.900
It's my mum,
I'm supposed to go round

34:36.902 --> 34:40.436
to theirs for this birthday dinner
thing, tonight. I completely forgot.

34:40.438 --> 34:41.703
Well, can't you call her

34:41.705 --> 34:43.072
and tell her
something came up?

34:45.505 --> 34:46.739
I can't.

34:47.806 --> 34:49.038
I'm sorry, Lulu.

34:59.538 --> 35:00.870
No, wait.

35:00.872 --> 35:02.173
I'll come with you.

35:03.004 --> 35:04.070
What?

35:04.072 --> 35:05.370
Well, you've been drinking

35:05.372 --> 35:08.340
so I can drive us there and bring
us back before it's too late.

35:09.172 --> 35:11.173
Gets, gets too late.

35:12.238 --> 35:14.504
Besides,
you wouldn't make me

35:14.506 --> 35:16.440
sit here on my own all
night, would you?

35:27.004 --> 35:28.005
Whoa.

35:34.506 --> 35:35.637
Cool car.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.273
Thanks. It's our uncle's.

35:41.073 --> 35:43.573
Oh. Shit.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.273
Cool uncle.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.338
Shit.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.572
Oh, oh, you bought a friend.
Wonderful.

36:10.574 --> 36:12.103
Come, in come in.

36:13.207 --> 36:14.207
Sorry, we are late.

36:35.506 --> 36:38.107
Here we are.

36:39.206 --> 36:41.707
We were starting
to worry about you.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.372
Oh, yeah,
sorry about...

36:45.374 --> 36:47.972
No, no, don't you worry, son.
We've only been waiting a couple of hours.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.972
You're here now
and that's what matters.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.271
Amen.

36:51.273 --> 36:53.438
What's the T-shirts?

36:56.374 --> 36:59.073
Hilarious, aren't they?

36:59.075 --> 37:01.071
It was your sister's idea,
she thought they were funny.

37:01.073 --> 37:04.171
Father George helped out.

37:04.173 --> 37:08.041
Did you know that Priests
get discounts in, um...

37:12.908 --> 37:14.007
Piccy Pics?

37:14.009 --> 37:15.072
Is that right?

37:15.074 --> 37:16.339
I didn't know that.

37:16.341 --> 37:18.172
We've got one for you, son.
Beth go get it.

37:18.174 --> 37:19.439
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.

37:19.441 --> 37:21.841
Oh, come on,
it's the party rule.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.572
We don't have one
for you, Lulu, I'm afraid.

37:24.574 --> 37:27.371
No, no, we do, we do, we do, no that...

37:27.373 --> 37:29.073
...one of the first ones...
...didn't go quite right you know.

37:29.075 --> 37:31.240
- Yes.
- Beth go and get that one too yeah.

37:31.242 --> 37:33.207
Oh, how fun.

37:47.342 --> 37:48.442
Happy birthday, son.

37:50.609 --> 37:51.609
Thanks.

38:07.242 --> 38:08.340
Oh, it's...

38:08.342 --> 38:11.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's ya Nan's pen knife.

38:11.009 --> 38:12.509
Yeah, um,
she wanted you to have it.

38:14.009 --> 38:15.877
She loved you very much, Jim.
We all do.

38:18.275 --> 38:19.706
Thanks, Dad.

38:19.708 --> 38:24.374
Yeah, it's okay to cry, you know, yeah.
It's not a weakness.

38:27.243 --> 38:29.407
Just be careful walking
around with that thing.

38:29.409 --> 38:30.974
Yeah, we don't want
the police mistaking you

38:30.976 --> 38:33.973
for some crazy knife wielding
maniac, do we, Lulu?

38:44.043 --> 38:46.274
So where did you
go to school, Lulu?

38:46.276 --> 38:49.808
Um, I was taught at home.

38:49.810 --> 38:51.574
Oh, is that right?

38:51.576 --> 38:55.575
Yeah, Daddy didn't,
um, trust schools so...

38:55.577 --> 38:58.208
Oh, our Jim would have
loved that, he hated school.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.440
Even at a good
Christian school like his.

39:00.442 --> 39:02.009
He was forever
being picked on.

39:02.011 --> 39:06.076
And called horrible names
like fatty and ginger and...

39:06.078 --> 39:07.175
Ginger fatty.

39:07.177 --> 39:08.275
I think she gets it.

39:20.178 --> 39:22.375
Oooh. Oooh.

39:22.377 --> 39:24.007
Shall we do the song?

39:24.009 --> 39:25.808
- Yes.
- No, no, not the song.

39:25.810 --> 39:28.741
Oh come on don't be silly,
it's tradition!

39:28.743 --> 39:30.608
Someone's a little
bit embarrassed.

39:30.610 --> 39:32.175
Lulu, do you want to hear it?

39:32.177 --> 39:33.509
Yes, please.

39:33.511 --> 39:35.074
Actually I feel a bit
I'm not feeling too great.

39:35.076 --> 39:37.074

I'm afraid, now open the door.

I'm not doing drugs.

42:24.881 --> 42:26.548
Open the fucking door.

42:32.081 --> 42:35.711
Hey, honestly,
I wasn't doing anything.

Hand me your
fucking purse, now.

42:50.014 --> 42:55.549
Are you sure there's not some
other way of sorting this out?

43:36.915 --> 43:38.249
Daddy, what's he doing?

43:42.249 --> 43:44.216
He's been touched

Oh, are you sure darling?

44:05.015 --> 44:06.846
Jim seems to be
having a good time.

44:06.848 --> 44:10.549
Yeah, it's just, we've got
a lot to do tomorrow, so.

44:11.615 --> 44:12.616
Jim.

44:13.515 --> 44:14.581
Jim.

44:18.950 --> 44:20.750
Maybe we should head back.

44:21.416 --> 44:24.148
To the club. Yes!

44:24.150 --> 44:27.348
Good idea, okay, thank you so much
for the most amazing birthday.

44:27.350 --> 44:28.351
Sis.

44:28.850 --> 44:29.914
Love you, Mama.

44:31.350 --> 44:32.350
Okay.

44:33.883 --> 44:36.515
It was a pleasure
to meet you all, bye.

44:36.517 --> 44:40.181
Ah, I think he's found
a good girl there.

44:53.317 --> 44:55.715
God, I wanted to be a drummer
when I was a kid.

44:55.717 --> 44:57.715
I always thought that was the
coolest thing to be, you know,

44:57.717 --> 45:00.848
everyone wants to be the front man
or the guitarist but I was always...

45:06.583 --> 45:08.248
I thought that was going
to be really weird didn't you?

45:08.250 --> 45:10.781
You meeting my parents like that
and I've just met you but...

45:10.783 --> 45:12.516
I thought it was fun.

45:12.518 --> 45:16.781
I thought that was really fun and I think
they liked you, you know, I really do.

45:16.783 --> 45:18.681
I mean why wouldn't they?
Look at you, you're perfect.

45:18.683 --> 45:22.149
No, I'm not.
Kitty says my nose is too big.

45:22.151 --> 45:25.048
- What? No. No.
- Yeah. No, she does.

45:25.050 --> 45:28.248
She... She says I need
to get some work done.

45:28.250 --> 45:32.150
Okay, if you change that face,
that is an insult to God.

45:36.318 --> 45:38.082
Stick to the plan.

45:38.084 --> 45:39.181
What's that?

45:39.183 --> 45:40.682
Motherfucker!

45:40.684 --> 45:43.082
Wooo, you're
an amazing driver, Lulu.

45:43.084 --> 45:44.748
- Thanks.
- What, how long, how fast are we going?

45:44.750 --> 45:47.049
Uh, 110.

45:47.051 --> 45:48.352
Whoo!

46:40.485 --> 46:41.586
Oh, man!

46:45.086 --> 46:46.483

46:46.485 --> 46:48.085
- Hiya love!
- Hiya.

46:48.087 --> 46:49.184
You coming down?

46:49.186 --> 46:50.549
- Come up.
- Alex, come down.

46:50.551 --> 46:52.384
- Come up.
- Why don't we go?

46:52.386 --> 46:53.484
Come up.

46:53.486 --> 46:54.554

47:17.719 --> 47:19.520
I've got something to tell
you, just come down.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.553
Kitty, what you doing?

47:23.353 --> 47:24.354
No.

47:29.054 --> 47:30.717
Hey let's,
let's go back to ours.

47:30.719 --> 47:33.350
- Okay, let's go, yeah.
- Yeah, I've just got to get Alex.

47:33.352 --> 47:34.418
No, no, no,
don't get him.

47:34.420 --> 47:36.085
No, he's my bro
from another ho I've gotta...

47:36.087 --> 47:37.388
No, No, No.
He's having a really good time.

47:42.852 --> 47:43.853
Jim!

47:46.354 --> 47:47.355
Jim!

47:48.920 --> 47:50.787
Whoo...

47:54.020 --> 47:56.418

47:56.420 --> 47:58.018

48:16.955 --> 48:18.953
Man, fucking ride

48:18.955 --> 48:20.751
What are you sucking off
your own face for?

48:20.753 --> 48:22.020
Fix up, bruv.

48:22.022 --> 48:24.087
Cause if you barge me again I'll
bang off your fucking jaw side

48:24.089 --> 48:25.485

you fucking dickhead.

48:25.487 --> 48:26.854
Just fuck off, man.

48:27.888 --> 48:29.287
He was a bit nasty, wasn't he?

48:29.289 --> 48:32.054
Gonna need some cognitive therapy.

48:39.422 --> 48:42.755
- Come on, Jim. Tune!
- Tune! Turn this up!

48:52.021 --> 48:54.285
Thank you so much girls for
allowing us to come with ya

48:54.287 --> 48:56.220
I honestly thank ya,

48:56.222 --> 48:57.920
Yeah, really, this is such

48:57.922 --> 49:00.486
We feel like we've really bonded
quite quickly with you guys.

49:00.488 --> 49:01.554
Definitely we do.

49:01.556 --> 49:03.287
And you're just nice,
really nice girls.

49:03.289 --> 49:04.723
I can't feel my face.

49:11.421 --> 49:12.954
Can I just say, Kitty.

49:12.956 --> 49:17.587
I'm extremely sorry about when I threw
the glass of water over your mid-region.

49:17.589 --> 49:18.687
Why d'you do that?

49:18.689 --> 49:20.286
It's fine, Alex, honestly.

49:20.288 --> 49:24.287
Cause I'm awfully sorry and I respect you
as a person, as a female, as a feminist.

49:24.289 --> 49:25.954
Look, Alex,
don't worry about it.

49:25.956 --> 49:28.354
Deep down I think
I'm quite into you.

49:28.356 --> 49:29.886
I could talk to you
d'ya know what I mean,

49:29.888 --> 49:32.187
you're sort of somebody that's
a very approachable person.

49:32.189 --> 49:34.054
Ya know you're very warm.

49:34.056 --> 49:35.120
Alex, Alex, Alex.

49:35.122 --> 49:37.586
I love you.
I don't, love you, not yet, I don't.

49:37.588 --> 49:40.021
I know
I'm gonna back off now.

49:40.023 --> 49:41.487
- I'm gonna stop talking bullshit.
- It's all right.

49:41.489 --> 49:44.088
He's a nice, he's nice,
he can just be a bit of a dick sometimes,

49:44.090 --> 49:45.554
but his hearts
is in the right place.

49:45.556 --> 49:46.655
Do your beatbox for us.

50:02.189 --> 50:04.022
- The countryside!
- Whoo!

50:04.024 --> 50:05.887
- Countryside!
- Whoo!

50:05.889 --> 50:07.489
It's like
going on holiday!

50:18.757 --> 50:21.588
Fucking hell I never want
to stop holding your hand.

50:21.590 --> 50:23.222
Don't, you don't have to.

50:23.224 --> 50:25.291
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, of course, man.

50:28.491 --> 50:30.688
I feel like I'm,
my jaws going a bit.

50:30.690 --> 50:33.923
No, you're sound mate. Are mine?
Are mine, all my lot?

50:34.356 --> 50:35.422

50:35.424 --> 50:36.424
They're great, man.

50:38.557 --> 50:42.489

underneath your frigging seat.

50:42.491 --> 50:44.221

No, thank you.

50:56.192 --> 50:57.856

50:57.858 --> 50:59.290

51:34.024 --> 51:36.188
Yeah, mate, hunky dory no

51:36.190 --> 51:37.656
Whoa, whoa.

51:40.726 --> 51:42.455

51:42.457 --> 51:44.823
Do you really want this?
Do you really want this then, mate?

51:44.825 --> 51:45.889
Yeah, all right.

51:45.891 --> 51:47.056

51:47.058 --> 51:48.190

- Done!

51:54.059 --> 51:55.591
Right what rescue service
are you with?

51:56.526 --> 51:57.526
Why?

51:58.292 --> 51:59.559
So they can rescue us!

52:01.593 --> 52:02.826
It's stolen.

52:04.426 --> 52:05.923
What? You said
it was your uncle's.

52:05.925 --> 52:08.727
It is.
We stole it from our uncle's.

52:09.692 --> 52:11.089
You stole your uncle's car?

52:11.091 --> 52:14.189
He doesn't mind.
He, he's in jail.

52:14.191 --> 52:16.691
He's a massive pervert.

52:16.693 --> 52:18.826
Well, that explains all the
shit in the glove compartment.

52:20.893 --> 52:22.193
So what we gonna do now?

52:26.458 --> 52:29.259
Right then,
righty righty oh.

52:30.726 --> 52:32.524
It's very hot,
is it supposed to be hot?

52:32.526 --> 52:34.991
- Yeah, I think it is, yeah.
- Engines are normally hot, okay.

52:34.993 --> 52:37.058
- Do you, do you know about cars?
- A bit.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.060
Yes, must be
'cause it's too hot.

52:44.925 --> 52:46.024
Sorry.

52:46.026 --> 52:47.393
Don't worry about it,
it's just a stupid t-shirt.

52:48.659 --> 52:50.227
You don't have
to wear yours either.

52:51.227 --> 52:52.394
I like it.

53:06.727 --> 53:08.560
What a night, eh?

53:10.594 --> 53:11.691
Oh, my God.

53:11.693 --> 53:13.658
What?

53:13.660 --> 53:16.258
Was I dancing in front of my parents?

53:16.260 --> 53:20.761
Oh, god!
Kill me now, Lulu, please.

53:23.826 --> 53:24.827
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:36.294 --> 53:37.428
Don't you need that?

53:38.760 --> 53:40.094
I'm due an upgrade anyway.

53:46.594 --> 53:47.725
Ooooh...

53:47.727 --> 53:50.891
Sorry. Sorry that was stupid
I don't know why I did that.

53:50.893 --> 53:55.059
I don't normally do stuff like that
especially after, major car accidents.

53:55.061 --> 53:57.092
No, it wasn't that,
I didn't...

53:57.094 --> 54:02.594
It's just I, I just I like
you and I thought, maybe.

54:04.460 --> 54:05.461
Idiot.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.562
I like you too.

54:14.094 --> 54:15.525
Right then, kids.

54:15.527 --> 54:17.028
I reckon I figured it out.

54:17.528 --> 54:18.860
It's fucked.

54:18.862 --> 54:20.525
Oh, great cheers, Alex.

54:20.527 --> 54:21.892
Well fear not
I have a plan.

54:21.894 --> 54:23.293
I just checked
the sat nav on my phone

54:23.295 --> 54:25.558
and it appears we are about a
mile away from my dad's place.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.260
So I suggest
we have a walk there,

54:27.262 --> 54:29.692
borrow his car and drive
to these girls house.

54:29.694 --> 54:31.992
The rest is TBC
to be honest with ya

54:31.994 --> 54:33.929
but I'm predicting a fucking riot.
Who's with me?

54:37.728 --> 54:39.062
This is ridiculous man.

54:40.162 --> 54:41.363
This is the one.

54:47.762 --> 54:51.294
You're gonna love him.
He's hilarious you watch.

54:51.296 --> 54:55.863
All right just wait there, wait there,
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

54:57.828 --> 54:58.862
Eh up, Dad!

55:00.262 --> 55:04.061
Hey Alex, hello sunshine.

55:04.063 --> 55:07.727
Come on you filthy
bastard I've gotta go.

55:07.729 --> 55:10.193
Yeah.
Cheers.

55:10.195 --> 55:11.260
- Ta.
- Thank you.

55:11.262 --> 55:12.896
- See ya.
- See ya. Bye.

55:17.296 --> 55:19.528
Cleaner. She's my cleaner.

55:19.530 --> 55:22.694
She's just been, cleaning up!

55:22.696 --> 55:27.827
Hey, come on what the fuck are you doing
standing outside you come inside come on.

55:27.829 --> 55:30.761
I mean, I call her a cleaner,
y'know. She is a cleaner,

55:30.763 --> 55:35.160
she's actually not very good.
I should probably fire her actually.

55:35.162 --> 55:38.931
So it's a little bit
messy, a little untidy.

55:39.430 --> 55:40.430
But, um...

55:42.295 --> 55:45.527
Oh. That's a bit embarrassing.

55:45.529 --> 55:48.096
Well, you know what they say,
you can't live with them.

55:48.098 --> 55:50.995
Can't wank without a naked
photo of one of them.

55:50.997 --> 55:53.628
It was a joke.
. Friends?

55:53.630 --> 55:57.361
- You know Jim, don't ya?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, ginger fatty Jaffa cake thief.

55:58.730 --> 56:00.261
He used to come round
when he was a kid

56:00.263 --> 56:02.728
and he ate all the Jaffa cakes and
then he was very big but now he's not.

56:02.730 --> 56:04.361
I had one, it was once.

56:04.363 --> 56:08.395
No, it was a packet. It was
like a triple packet of Jaffa cakes.

56:08.397 --> 56:10.398
- I was really hungry.
- He was very sick.

56:10.897 --> 56:12.161
These two boys?

56:12.163 --> 56:13.397
Lulu, Kitty.

56:13.931 --> 56:15.362
Kulu and Litty.

56:15.364 --> 56:17.598
- Hi.
- Lovely names, lovely names.

56:20.397 --> 56:22.062
Sort of strippers
names, isn't it?

56:22.064 --> 56:23.698
I mean, you're not
strippers, are you?

56:24.263 --> 56:25.264
No.

56:26.163 --> 56:28.063
That's a shame.
You could be.

56:28.531 --> 56:29.729
Thanks.

56:29.731 --> 56:32.364
Sit down,

56:36.932 --> 56:38.261
- Yeah, dead good.

56:38.263 --> 56:40.731
- Is she? Yeah. Good.
- Fine.

56:41.297 --> 56:42.629
Good. Fuck her.

56:42.631 --> 56:44.996
You give her my love, won't you?
You give her my love.

56:44.998 --> 56:46.262
I will. I will send
my love yeah.

56:46.264 --> 56:47.361
Actually
that's not right.

56:47.363 --> 56:49.863
She...
She should give me her love.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.598
You know,
she should give me her love.

56:52.731 --> 56:53.732
Excuse me.

56:54.330 --> 56:55.795
Can we use your toilet.

56:55.797 --> 56:57.996
Absolutely, number ones
or number twos?

56:57.998 --> 56:59.430
You.

56:59.432 --> 57:02.563
Of course, you go and take a shit
take a wee, whatever you wanna do.

57:02.565 --> 57:03.798
- Thank you.
- Might need a flush.

57:05.764 --> 57:06.931
Follow your nose.

57:11.398 --> 57:15.430
So, come on you Jimmy,
Jimmy, Jimmy Jimson.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.863

57:22.766 --> 57:23.897
What you doing?

57:23.899 --> 57:25.064

57:25.066 --> 57:26.799
What? I am doing exactly

57:29.232 --> 57:32.996
Look come on, I'm your sister
you can tell me. What's wrong?

57:32.998 --> 57:35.997
Well, just,

57:35.999 --> 57:39.164
I was thinking maybe
we could let them go.

57:39.166 --> 57:41.763
Jim just seems nice, you know,
he's different from the others

57:41.765 --> 57:43.264
and we've still got time
to find another one.

57:43.266 --> 57:44.266
Okay.

57:46.031 --> 57:47.266
Is that it?

57:47.632 --> 57:48.766
Is that all?

57:49.766 --> 57:51.433
You're a silly sausage,
aren't you?

57:54.899 --> 57:59.733
You are doing it, tonight.
Do you understand?

58:01.398 --> 58:02.600
Good to see ya.

58:03.465 --> 58:05.064
What's happening,

58:05.066 --> 58:06.463
Trying to go back
to their house,

58:06.465 --> 58:07.600

of a shindig.

58:08.065 --> 58:10.798
Okay.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.463
I need to change my shirt
and maybe wash under my arms.

58:12.465 --> 58:14.597
No, we just need to borrow your car, Dad.
If that's all right?

58:14.599 --> 58:15.600
Just borrow your car.

58:18.099 --> 58:21.264
Yep, that's fine, yep.

Oh, fuck.

58:59.366 --> 59:02.564
<i>There's been a break through
in the mystery surrounding the disappearance</i>

59:02.566 --> 59:05.165
<i>of 33 year old Steven Barker.</i>

59:05.167 --> 59:07.601

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.536
Just got to find
my phone.

01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:15.903
What the fuck's all that?

01:01:16.936 --> 01:01:18.234
Snacks and stuff.

01:01:18.236 --> 01:01:20.168
We're going to a fuck
party not a picnic, Jim.

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.371
Well, I panicked! Okay?

01:01:27.936 --> 01:01:29.201
Get the knife.

01:01:29.203 --> 01:01:31.335
No, we can't kill him they're
gonna be back any minute!

01:01:31.337 --> 01:01:33.034
Get the chloroform then!

01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:36.100
Fucker.

01:01:36.102 --> 01:01:37.200
Come on!

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:39.867
I'm trying!
Argh, it's here!

01:01:39.869 --> 01:01:40.870
Put it on a shirt!

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:45.433
There.

01:01:57.205 --> 01:01:58.205
He's out.

01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:04.405
Get him up. Get him up, get him up,
come on, get him up, get him up.

01:02:12.404 --> 01:02:14.202
Bombay mix?

01:02:23.404 --> 01:02:25.438
Shhh.

01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:36.601
Yeah, he just
sort of passed out.

01:02:36.603 --> 01:02:38.870
Oh, yeah,
sorry, he does that.

01:02:38.872 --> 01:02:41.336
Maybe we should wait till
he wakes up or something?

01:02:41.338 --> 01:02:44.103
No, you lot just go ahead
and I'll see you in a sec.

01:02:44.105 --> 01:02:46.536
Maybe you should stay here with
him, I mean, he is your dad.

01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:49.672
No, no, he'll be fine he just, he just needs
to sleep it off, that's all, honestly.

01:02:51.038 --> 01:02:52.039
Okay.

01:03:14.673 --> 01:03:15.673
I love you, Dad.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.539
You all right?

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.040
Yeah.

01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:34.504
Shit.

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:35.702
What?

01:03:35.704 --> 01:03:37.140
It's past midnight,
you're 30.

01:03:40.071 --> 01:03:42.240
Wait. What time
were you born?

01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:44.737
About 4:00 a.m.
I think.

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.571
Well, so we've still got
fucking time then, mate.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.140
I told you I don't break
me promises.

01:03:57.739 --> 01:04:00.805
<i>A club bouncer
has been found murdered in a ladies toilet</i>

01:04:00.807 --> 01:04:02.504
<i>in East London.</i>

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.404
<i>Police have released
a statement saying</i>

01:04:04.406 --> 01:04:10.237
<i>they do believe this latest incident is
connected to the so called "Man Eaters."</i>

01:04:10.239 --> 01:04:15.672
<i>Those two women already hunted by police were
seen hurriedly leaving the club with two men.</i>

01:04:15.674 --> 01:04:20.437
<i>Both men may had been under the influence
of a significant amount of drugs.</i>

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:24.707
<i>Police have assured the public they are
extremely close to catching these wo...</i>

01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:27.275
Take the next left.

01:05:08.908 --> 01:05:11.975
Do you, do you wanna
go up to my room?

01:05:14.707 --> 01:05:15.708
Yep.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:34.242
Jim, I've got
something to tell you.

01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:37.773
Whoa. Okay.

01:05:37.775 --> 01:05:40.676
No, it's about me.
I don't think you're gonna like it.

01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:55.709
Turn around.

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:00.442
Take your clothes off.

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:03.742
Yup.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.872
Um...

01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:27.273
Kitty, I really like ya.
And I just, I know I talk a lot a...

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.842
I talk a lot a bullshit.
But, because I've never,

01:06:29.844 --> 01:06:33.209
I never met anyone like you before.
And I just, I just think you're really...

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:36.210
Sorry.

01:06:39.776 --> 01:06:42.040
Just tell me,
I promise I won't laugh.

01:06:42.042 --> 01:06:44.374
No I'm pretty sure
you won't.

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:45.907
Oh, my God,
you're a man, aren't you?

01:06:45.909 --> 01:06:46.973
No!

01:06:46.975 --> 01:06:48.341
I knew there was something...

01:06:48.343 --> 01:06:50.540
- No, Jim I'm not.
- It's the hands you've got the big hands.

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:52.440
- I knew this was too good to be true.
- Will you just listen to me/

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:54.043
Me and Kitty
killed four men.

01:07:13.943 --> 01:07:15.277
I'm so sorry, Jim.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.409
Wait, you were gonna...

01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:22.507
The Virgin is supposed
to be the final sacrifice.

01:07:22.509 --> 01:07:24.977
- How do you know I'm...
- It's amazing what you can find online.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.377
No, wait, hold on.

01:07:32.244 --> 01:07:34.242
The first girl I really like
is a serial killer?

01:07:34.244 --> 01:07:39.209
It's not that bad, Kitty did most
of the killings. I just helped her.

01:07:39.211 --> 01:07:40.578
Oh, let's get married then!

01:07:57.044 --> 01:07:58.108
What the fuck...

01:08:19.844 --> 01:08:21.309
Well, I'm sorry about that.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.076
I didn't want to hit you
with a piece of wood, did I?

01:08:24.611 --> 01:08:26.245
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey?

01:08:27.578 --> 01:08:28.845
What the fuck are you doing?

01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:30.710
What you getting?

01:08:30.712 --> 01:08:32.479
What's all that about?
Are you fucking?

01:08:33.911 --> 01:08:37.676
Why is my Jim on the fucking wall
for starters? Right bollocks.

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:39.310
I swear to God if you come any
closer I'm gonna do you in.

01:08:39.312 --> 01:08:43.876
I will, come any closer, I fucking will,
promise you, love. Fuck off, fuck off.

01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:58.479
Jesus. Fucking love, give us
a rest a minute, please, I promise.

01:09:00.145 --> 01:09:01.145
Fuck off!

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.679
Fucking hell!

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.580
Fucking bitch!

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.077
Fucking hell, love!

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880

01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:50.712
I'm pissing blood here!

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.714
Are you fucking serious?

01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:58.381
Could we not just
have a truce man?

01:09:58.913 --> 01:10:00.144
Don't. Are you real?

01:10:01.946 --> 01:10:03.447
I don't wanna fucking do...

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.579
Well, come the fuck on then, man,
I've had it, I ain't playing no more.

01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:09.145
Come on, then.

01:10:09.147 --> 01:10:10.944
Come on 'en,

01:10:10.946 --> 01:10:12.045

Come on, then!
Come through it come on.

01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:16.844
Come through then, come through...

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:17.911
Fuck.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.614
So wait, your uncle's car,
was that, was that real?

01:10:56.714 --> 01:10:57.849
Jesus.

01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.915
Was anything true?

01:11:00.847 --> 01:11:02.048
One thing.

01:11:04.115 --> 01:11:06.112
Look she's gone
completely insane.

01:11:06.114 --> 01:11:07.713
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

01:11:07.715 --> 01:11:09.383
She thinks all of this is
going to bring him back.

01:11:09.714 --> 01:11:10.715
Who?

01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:14.279

Please leave me

01:13:54.818 --> 01:13:56.452
Fucking Jesus.

01:14:05.218 --> 01:14:07.785
Well I wasn't expecting that.

01:14:30.819 --> 01:14:34.186
There's no time to explain to
you, you have to get out of here please.

01:14:35.218 --> 01:14:36.584
What about Alex?

01:14:36.586 --> 01:14:38.249
No, it's too late.

01:14:38.251 --> 01:14:40.552
Please, Jim,
you've got to run!

01:14:41.252 --> 01:14:42.719
Go run!

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.587
I can't keep running away,
you know.

01:14:53.486 --> 01:14:55.286
I've been running away
from things my whole life.

01:14:58.285 --> 01:14:59.287
It's time...

01:15:02.453 --> 01:15:03.654
Daddy's waiting.

01:15:04.385 --> 01:15:05.387
Come on.

01:16:28.954 --> 01:16:30.522
Shush, little boy.

01:19:18.891 --> 01:19:19.891
Daddy!

01:19:26.092 --> 01:19:27.391
Daddy.

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:36.255
I knew it would work.

01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:38.459
I did everything
you taught me.

01:19:39.592 --> 01:19:42.989
Now what we have to do
is bleed the virgin.

01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:46.458
And we can be a family
again, right? Can't we?

01:19:48.425 --> 01:19:49.426
Right?

01:20:04.725 --> 01:20:05.726
No!

01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:09.389
- Shut up!
- No, please.

01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.227
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:11.726 --> 01:20:13.127
Get him, Daddy!

01:20:15.692 --> 01:20:17.456
Please, Kitty,
don't do this!

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:19.391
Shut up! Shut up!

01:20:32.759 --> 01:20:34.225
Stop it, please.

01:20:34.227 --> 01:20:36.093
I am so sick of you!

01:20:39.093 --> 01:20:40.727
Motherfucker!

01:20:41.925 --> 01:20:43.624
Jim, I'm here for you, mate!

01:20:45.226 --> 01:20:47.891
What is, oh, God...

01:20:47.893 --> 01:20:49.090
Fucking idiot!

01:20:50.961 --> 01:20:52.358
Come on, Jim!

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.061
Shut up,
you fucking ugly bitch!

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.560
Get him Daddy!

01:21:06.393 --> 01:21:09.060
Fuck you, Daddy!

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.428
Daddy!

01:21:26.893 --> 01:21:29.561
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy!

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.592
No, Daddy.
Daddy. Daddy, no.

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.261
Daddy. Daddy.

01:21:58.128 --> 01:22:01.892
Get in! Come on!

01:22:09.161 --> 01:22:11.160
You ginger fucker!

01:23:27.163 --> 01:23:29.164
Jim, am I missing
a tooth here, mate?

01:23:30.263 --> 01:23:31.697
- No, you look fine.
- Okay.

01:23:42.062 --> 01:23:43.329
You should probably run.

01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:58.897
I'm so sorry,
we tried to kill you, Jim.

01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:04.328
I'm sorry, I kicked
your Dad's head off.

01:24:08.763 --> 01:24:10.063
I'll never forget you.

01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:14.331
I don't think
I'll forget you either.

01:24:16.563 --> 01:24:18.261
Not without a few years
of therapy anyway.

01:24:24.797 --> 01:24:25.798
Bye, Jim.

01:24:27.597 --> 01:24:28.597
Bye, Lulu.

01:24:49.732 --> 01:24:50.796
Armed police,
show me your hands.

01:24:50.798 --> 01:24:52.228
Armed police
put your hands in the air.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:53.495
Put your hands
where I can see them.

01:24:53.497 --> 01:24:54.595
Keep your hands in the air.

01:24:54.597 --> 01:24:56.264
Walk towards us.
Keep coming towards me.

01:24:58.063 --> 01:24:59.729
Stay still.

01:24:59.731 --> 01:25:01.799
Put your hands on your head. Interlock
your fingers on top of your head do it now.

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:04.966
Kneel down.

01:25:06.564 --> 01:25:08.265
So what's it like kissing
a psychopath?

01:25:10.032 --> 01:25:11.565
She's not a psychopath.

01:25:13.965 --> 01:25:14.966
Did you get her number?

01:25:16.932 --> 01:25:19.799
She's going to prison, Alex.
Probably for life.

01:25:21.165 --> 01:25:24.898
Yeah, well,
yeah she is.

01:25:26.398 --> 01:25:27.899
Happy birthday, brother.

01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:29.632
Cheers.

01:25:34.699 --> 01:25:36.300
I guess I didn't
keep my promise.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.300
There's no rush.
