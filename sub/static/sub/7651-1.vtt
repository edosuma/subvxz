03:06.604 --> 03:08.522
So gentle.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.613
Whatever works.

03:24.914 --> 03:25.915
Jesus.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.836
No. No!

03:30.920 --> 03:33.088
Leave him alone!

03:34.423 --> 03:35.424
Get up!

03:39.178 --> 03:41.239
You're just screwing
everybody, aren't you, you son of a...

03:41.263 --> 03:42.389
- No!
- ...bitch!

03:49.855 --> 03:50.898
That should do it.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.202
Oh, my God.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.837
It's all right. It's all right.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.091
The worst part's over now.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.052
Yeah.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.639
We'll go away.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.643
Visit my family.

04:29.645 --> 04:30.646
You'd like my family.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.111
I just love this house.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.886
It's such a classic Victorian.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.763
It was built around 1886.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.182
Probably remodeled slightly in the 40s.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.810
I know what you're thinking.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.270
It needs a lot of TLC

05:11.353 --> 05:14.106
and is a little pricier than
what we were talking about originally,

05:14.189 --> 05:16.567
but remember you've got
two rental units downstairs

05:16.650 --> 05:17.890
to help you cover the mortgage.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.820
And I really think, relatively speaking

05:19.903 --> 05:22.906
we can get this place
for a song. Up here...

05:22.990 --> 05:23.991
What do you think?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.368
Seven hundred and fifty grand, huh?

05:26.577 --> 05:28.245
It's not a song, it's an opera.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.249
Between my savings and Drake's,
we can cover the down payment.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.644
And the realtor said
we can get one of those

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
home equity loans for improvements.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.589
You'd be totally tapped out.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.549
But we'll have rental units.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.818
Well, what if you can't rent them?

05:41.842 --> 05:45.054
Oh, come on. The vacancy rate
in this area is less than 2%.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.015
Look, do you want my advice
or my approval?

05:48.599 --> 05:49.799
- Your advice.
- Your approval.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.435
Pass.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.811
It's too risky a call.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.522
I mean, if someone misses
one month's rent

05:55.606 --> 05:57.274
you're gonna go down like the <i>Titanic.</i>

05:57.441 --> 05:59.836
I don't even... I don't even think
you can get approved for the loan

05:59.860 --> 06:00.861
at your income level.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.571
We'll fudge the numbers a little.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.406
Yeah. Everybody does it.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.075
It's expected.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.453
"Legal description of building."

06:10.037 --> 06:11.288
It's a building.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.975
Uh, I don't think that's what they mean.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.294
- It's... It's like a...
- It's a... It's a wooden building

06:17.586 --> 06:18.670
with windows.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.132
All right. We'll come back to that one.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.052
Um, my previous employment.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.680
Equestrian.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.724
It's too pompous.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.476
- Self-employed.
- Okay.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.146
"Manner in which title will be held."

06:37.314 --> 06:38.315
Like this.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.017
Please, please.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.904
"Held with both hands
with a pity expression."

06:46.532 --> 06:48.292
I can't believe
we're actually gonna do this.

06:51.703 --> 06:52.871
Marital status.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.624
Single.

06:59.795 --> 07:00.963
Come on!

07:02.131 --> 07:03.924
Come on! Get it down, buddy! Come on!

07:04.466 --> 07:05.843
Come on! Knock it down!

07:07.136 --> 07:09.847
Mine! Now it's all mine!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.821
We rent the studio for a thousand

07:26.363 --> 07:27.865
and the one-bedroom for $1,200.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.242
$1,300.
You should go up and down.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.828
All right. $1,300.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.913
- That leaves us, uh...
- $1,400.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.416
...$1,400 to cover
the mortgage which is

07:37.499 --> 07:39.460
$300 a month less
than we used to be paying

07:39.543 --> 07:40.623
for our two old apartments.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.421
- So we're actually saving money.
- Yeah.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.132
Assuming that we don't go broke
before we rent them.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.677
Then you've got to replace
the plumbing and rewire the electric.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.655
We have to remember this
is an investment, Patty.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.306
We can't afford to do
everything at once.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.892
It's not just
an investment, it's our home.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.645
Well. You want something to drink?

07:59.605 --> 08:00.606
Sure.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.278
Hey, there's a cat outside.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.864
Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.866
Could be good luck.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.497
- Aw, could be hungry.
- Yeah.

08:17.789 --> 08:18.790
Thanks.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
Mmm.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.050
I'm pooped.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.567
Is that your manly walk?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.819
It's the only walk I've got.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.374
You feel comfortable.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.697
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.294
- Like your old saddle?
- Better.

09:04.795 --> 09:08.423
I just wish I had some spurs.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.218
You taste like turpentine.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.847
That's better.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.357
- Hi, there.
- Good afternoon.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.720
Welcome to the neighborhood, huh?

09:27.818 --> 09:30.195
- Well, thank you.
- I like your place.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.521
Hi.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.315
Hi. How're you doing today?

10:06.648 --> 10:07.774
Fine, thank you.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.278
- How do you like the color?
- Pretty good.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.663
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Thayer.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.583
Drake Goodman. I'm sorry I'm late.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.045
Ran into double overtime
and I forgot about our appointment.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.089
This is the apartment.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.925
We're asking $1,300 a month

10:34.009 --> 10:36.178
plus the $2,000 security deposit.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.514
You pay the gas and electric

10:39.598 --> 10:41.725
and we pay the... The water and garbage.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.561
Here. Take this.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.375
- In the back here we have the kitchen.
- Oh, it's great.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.693
Brand new gas stove,
disposal, microwave...

10:55.280 --> 10:57.032
Stop that!

10:58.408 --> 10:59.534
There's a full bath.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.787
All the original tiles' been redone.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.038
It's the original bathtub.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.414
We'd want to repaint.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.042
Yeah, we'd, uh, pay
for all the materials...

11:07.125 --> 11:08.919
It's so chalky now.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.712
What color did you have in mind?

11:11.963 --> 11:12.964
Black.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.594
Here's the gas stove

11:17.678 --> 11:20.555
and dishwasher,
the microwave, the disposal.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.599
I'm sure Drake showed you all this.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.102
And you credit
and references all checked out...

11:27.062 --> 11:28.939
- Oh, we'll paint over that.
- Huh?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.399
We'll paint over it.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.403
- You don't have children, do you?
- No.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
This is a very nice place.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.240
We just wanted to look at it again

11:38.323 --> 11:39.523
- to be sure.
- Thank you. Yes.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.164
Just got separated from my wife.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.333
I'm hell in the kitchen.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.213
I've been thinking about
taking a cooking class or something.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.384
Excuse me.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.512
- We will take the apartment.
- Oh, great. Okay.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.014
We would like to start
moving in by tomorrow.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.225
Pardon me. A thousand a month?

12:05.517 --> 12:08.854
Yeah. Oh, and a $1,500 security deposit.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.564
I can handle that.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.024
I'll have the key
for you in the morning then.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.152
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Watanabe.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.821
So long, Mrs. Watanabe.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.699
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.666
Uh, any chance I can pay you half now
half at the end of the month?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.918
I'm in this 90-day CD.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.462
We'll have to check your credit.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.464
No sweat. My credit's solid.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.258
Actually, I've been looking
to buy a place

12:38.341 --> 12:40.361
but I haven't found anything I like
for the price, you know.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.636
Mmm-hmm. Here you go.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.347
I said my credit's solid.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.558
Well, you still have
to fill out an application

12:46.641 --> 12:48.477
and Drake'll wanna check it out.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.603
Understand something.

12:49.895 --> 12:53.023
I want this apartment. My credit
is good. I don't want to lose...

12:53.106 --> 12:55.567
Obviously, you're
at the top of the list, Mr. Baker.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.861
You're the first person
who's seen the place.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.655
Yeah.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.493
Okay.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.286
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.124
- Uh, Ms. Palmer?
- Yeah?

13:11.625 --> 13:12.793
I'm sorry.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.462
I just get the runaround
so much, you know.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.672
That's okay. No sweat.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.358
I'll get this back to you
as soon as I can.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.383
Okay.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.191
Patty?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.776
In here. I'm sick.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.240
What's the matter?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.367
I'll be all right. Answer the door.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.868
It might be Mr. What's-his-name

13:46.952 --> 13:48.370
for the key to downstairs.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.350
- Morning.
- Good morning.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.881
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:00.966 --> 14:04.094
Mrs. Watanabe, these are the keys
to the back apartment.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.179
- I'm so sorry so early.
- It's okay.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.265
I'll just, uh, I'll just go get dressed.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.184
All these people aren't
moving in with you, are they?

14:54.728 --> 14:55.812
Mr. Palmer, right?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.522
Goodman. Drake Goodman.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.190
Sorry.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.443
Very good.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.028
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Carter Hayes.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.696
I stopped by a couple weeks ago

15:04.779 --> 15:06.448
and spoke with, uh, your wife

15:06.573 --> 15:08.158
about renting the studio apartment.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.969
- My... My girlfriend.
- Oh, your girlfriend?

15:09.993 --> 15:11.387
Oh, sorry. We don't wanna
rush anything, do we?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.956
- I assume it's still available?
- Yes, it is.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.249
- Um...
- Is Patty here?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.560
I don't wanna
keep you here if you've got...

15:17.584 --> 15:19.896
No, it's no problem. You know,
I'm... I'm taking care of the rentals.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.160
Did she show you the apartment?

15:21.212 --> 15:23.316
No. No, I'd like to take
a look at it if you don't mind.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.883
Oh, good. Yeah, we can go this way.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.485
Listen, is it all right
if I leave my car here?

15:26.509 --> 15:27.594
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.618
<i>Boy, you've done
a beautiful job here.</i>

15:33.642 --> 15:34.643
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:35.143 --> 15:37.270
It's, uh, it's taken about
every cent we've got.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.563
Yeah. I'll bet.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.232
I love these old Victorians.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.736
My grandmother, uh,
my father's mother, I guess it was,

15:44.819 --> 15:46.863
grew up in a mansion in Pacific Heights.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.406
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

15:48.698 --> 15:52.160
Uh, Broadway and, uh... I don't know.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.523
I don't know. They tore it down.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.247
I'd never actually been there
but I've seen the photographs,

15:56.331 --> 15:58.667
you know, I heard all the stories.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.587
Boy, can you imagine what that piece
of real estate be worth today, huh?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.607
Well, you know,
we all gotta start somewhere.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.632
Yeah.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.009
- Is this your first place?
- Yes, it is.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.930
You and you're, uh,
girlfriend went in on it together?

16:12.097 --> 16:13.515
Yeah. You know, partners.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.142
Yeah. It's hard, isn't it?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.896
Well, it's the first time
we've lived together.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.565
It's working though.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.026
Not to mention the rent we're saving.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.196
When can I move in, Drake?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.800
Oh, well, you know, I just
have to fill out an application...

16:30.824 --> 16:32.534
You know, I'd like to...
If you don't mind,

16:32.617 --> 16:34.536
pay you the first six months in advance.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.013
Right. I still need you to get this...

16:36.037 --> 16:37.580
I may even have it all on me.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.208
Uh, the reason for the six months is

16:40.291 --> 16:42.127
I travel a lot in my business

16:42.210 --> 16:43.396
and I'm in and out of the country.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.382
So I can't always guarantee
that I'll be here first of the month.

16:47.465 --> 16:51.553
Damn. I've only got about $2,900 on me.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.639
How about if I pay you $2,000 now

16:54.723 --> 16:56.367
and then of course,
I could pay you the rest next week.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.810
Or I could wire you
the entire amount, which would be

16:58.935 --> 17:00.145
- 70...
- $7,500.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.397
$7,500
from my bank at San Antonio.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.818
Um, you know, I'm sorry.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.671
But I still have
to get this application filled out.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.820
It's just a formality.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.991
Yeah. It's a credit history,
that sort of thing.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.077
Yeah. Um, is... Is there a problem?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.622
Well, no. It's just that
I work for a private trust

17:19.955 --> 17:23.001
and the trust pays me
my expenses and my salary.

17:23.084 --> 17:26.296
They pay me bank cards,
my room and board, etc.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.965
So I don't really have that
traditional kind of credit.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.593
- You understand?
- Um, could I verify the trust?

17:33.428 --> 17:36.473
Well, see, I'm bound
by client confidentiality.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.935
I mean, they're a prominent family,
and they've got interests worldwide.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.606
Boy, believe me,
I would if I could. Let me think.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.776
I'm always running
into this problem, you know?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.236
- Do you have a phone?
- Yeah, upstairs.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.280
You know, better yet,
I'll tell you what.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.987
Why don't I give you
some local personal references?

17:55.033 --> 17:57.660
Or you can all the trust
private attorney, uh, Bennett Fidlow.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.909
Yeah, okay.
Uh, previous landlord.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.039
I got it.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.376
Yeah. I hope you don't mind
calling out of town.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.444
I don't think you'll have a problem.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.385
No, no. Mr. Hayes
listed Mr. Fidlow

18:14.469 --> 18:16.971
as a personal reference
on a rental application.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.241
<i>I'm sorry. What was that name again?</i>

18:19.265 --> 18:21.392
- Carter Hayes.
<i>- Hayes.</i>

18:21.476 --> 18:22.644
<i>Mr. Fidlow only handles...</i>

18:22.727 --> 18:25.980
Ma'am, ma'am. Yes, Mr. Hayes told me
that it was a private family trust.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.565
This is just a personal reference.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.151
<i>Yes. Well, he'll have to give you
that information himself.</i>

18:30.235 --> 18:32.737
I see. Well, when
Mr. Fidlow gets the time

18:32.821 --> 18:34.322
could you please have him call me?

18:34.405 --> 18:35.782
<i>I will. Goodbye.</i>

18:38.827 --> 18:41.162
<i>No, no.
He... He was a model tenant.</i>

18:41.329 --> 18:42.872
Always paid his rent on time,

18:42.956 --> 18:44.499
left the unit spotlessly clean.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.586
In fact, I... I think I gave him
his whole security deposit back.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.506
That was the first time
I've ever done that.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.259
<i>So you can definitely
recommend Mr. Hayes?</i>

18:54.926 --> 18:58.012
I can recommend him to you
with no hesitation at all.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.019
<i>Thank you. I'd like to
thank you for your time.</i>

19:00.056 --> 19:01.349
Listen, uh,

19:01.850 --> 19:03.852
just out of curiosity, uh,

19:03.935 --> 19:07.105
where has Carter moved to,
Mr., uh, Mr...

19:07.188 --> 19:08.606
<i>- Goodman.</i>
- Mr. Goodman.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.441
Just... Just out of curiosity.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.944
Uh, do... Do you have that address?

19:17.198 --> 19:19.450
- What about Mr. Baker?
- What about him?

19:19.534 --> 19:20.660
He was here first.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.954
Well, where's his application?

19:23.538 --> 19:25.748
Maybe he's one
of those minority scam artists.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.375
What are you talking about?

19:27.625 --> 19:30.020
You know, they... They try to get you
worried about discrimination

19:30.044 --> 19:31.313
so you don't check their credit.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.630
That's not what happened.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.925
Some of these people
can be pretty shrewd, Patty.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.052
How would you know?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.890
It's not a racial thing.
It's just common sense.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.767
Look, I spoke to the woman at the bank

19:44.851 --> 19:48.521
and she told me that Carter Hayes'
income is over $200,000 a year.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.772
I've checked him out.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.942
Okay, fine. Then let's
rent to him if you say he's okay.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.361
He's a nice guy. You met him.

19:55.945 --> 19:56.946
When?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.311
Couple of weeks ago.
He said he came by and talked to you.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.117
I don't think so.

20:01.576 --> 20:04.176
He knew your name. Why would he say
he talked to you if he hadn't?

20:04.495 --> 20:05.580
I don't know.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.376
Look, Patty, I'm just
taking up the slack here.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.605
I mean, you're worried
about the paint and the wallpaper.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.269
Somebody's gotta rent
these two apartments

20:14.339 --> 20:16.049
so we can make next month's mortgage.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.468
You're losing your sense of humor.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.428
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.932
You're becoming
a crotchety old man with his building.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.987
Next thing I know, you're gonna have
hair growing out of weird parts

20:27.018 --> 20:30.104
of your face and you'll be
wandering around with a toilet plunger

20:30.188 --> 20:34.192
and griping about property
taxes and people who take long showers.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.915
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.948
No, I won't.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.747
You don't think I can handle this?

20:48.289 --> 20:49.415
Yes, I do.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.256
Somebody in here?

22:21.883 --> 22:22.884
Oh, hi.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.720
I thought you were
from the, uh, phone company.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.056
Who are you?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.099
I'm, uh... I'm your new tenant.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.810
I'm Carter Hayes.
You must be Patty, right?

22:32.894 --> 22:33.895
Yeah.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.939
I think I spoke
with you a couple of weeks ago...

22:37.023 --> 22:38.399
No. You didn't.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.485
How did you get in here?

22:40.651 --> 22:42.445
Well, the door was open a little,
and I, uh,

22:42.570 --> 22:44.113
I just opened it and came on in.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.216
I didn't wanna ring the buzzer
and bother you so early.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.909
So I just let myself in.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.577
Hope that's okay.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.540
Drake said it would be all right
if I came by for the phone installation.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.332
Oh.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.584
Was that you hammering?

22:57.835 --> 22:58.836
No.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.298
You did a great job
restoring this place.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.717
Thanks.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.346
Did you those pick those,
uh, light fixtures out?

23:09.180 --> 23:10.181
Yeah.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.103
You have nice taste.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.146
Thanks.

23:20.691 --> 23:21.859
Nice meeting you.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.670
I found a roofer.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.047
It's gonna cost us
75 bucks for an estimate.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.967
It's a good thing
I rented that other apartment.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.219
Mr. Hayes is downstairs.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.596
What do you mean he's downstairs?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.764
In the apartment.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.350
Did you let him in?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.601
He was already in.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.802
Well, I told him he can't move in
till we get his money.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.315
Well, I heard hammering
and there he was.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.401
What was he hammering?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.111
He said he wasn't.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.785
Mr. Hayes?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.122
It's Drake Goodman.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.125
Carter?

24:21.127 --> 24:22.336
Is anybody in there?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.041
I'm sorry. But we have
no record of a wire transfer

25:00.124 --> 25:01.584
to your account, Mr. Goodman.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.212
My tenant assured me
the money would be wired today.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.631
Bank Of Texas.
$7,500.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.442
You know, maybe the bank lost the money

25:08.466 --> 25:10.301
or got credited to the wrong account?

25:10.384 --> 25:11.636
It's doubtful.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.931
But I need the transaction numbers
to tell you anything more.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.309
It is possible
he never wired the money, Mr. Goodman.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.894
For his own reasons.

25:21.562 --> 25:24.106
Look, please,
just check the account one more time.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.958
Who... Who are you?

25:44.418 --> 25:45.419
Who are you?

25:45.795 --> 25:47.380
- I'm the landlord.
- Oh.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.049
Carter went to Seattle on business.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.217
He'll be back on Friday.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.694
Carter was supposed
to wire me some money

25:52.718 --> 25:54.679
for his rent and his security deposit.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.043
- It never came.
- Look, I don't know anything about that.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.738
You're gonna
have to talk to Carter. Okay?

26:01.018 --> 26:02.019
What's your name?

26:02.270 --> 26:03.563
- Greg.
- Greg, listen,

26:03.813 --> 26:05.648
if you speak to Carter before Friday

26:05.731 --> 26:07.334
would you please tell him
that he's got this problem

26:07.358 --> 26:08.460
with his rent
and his security deposit...

26:08.484 --> 26:10.284
Yeah, well, it sounds
like your problem. Okay?

26:10.861 --> 26:12.863
Ask him to call me
with the transaction numbers

26:12.947 --> 26:14.174
or give them to you to give to me

26:14.198 --> 26:15.533
so we can straighten this out.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.119
Yeah. I'll be sure
to give him the message.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.653
Oh.
He just hit a wire. It's okay.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.447
I'll go down and fix it.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.241
Um, don't pull that nail
until I say it's okay.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.326
All right.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.245
You require new wires.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.247
This is a very dangerous situation.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.380
Okay.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.093
I got it.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.555
Is it on?

27:19.722 --> 27:20.723
No.

27:29.857 --> 27:30.941
How about now?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.318
Not yet.

27:35.905 --> 27:36.906
Drake?

27:37.239 --> 27:38.240
No, Patty.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.081
Did that do it?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.374
Not yet.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.255
There you go!

27:54.090 --> 27:55.091
Okay.

28:02.556 --> 28:03.557
Mr. Hayes?

28:04.975 --> 28:05.976
Is that you?

28:13.109 --> 28:14.110
Mr. Hayes?

28:28.666 --> 28:30.501
- Drake?
- Hey, you fixed it.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.794
Hayes is down there.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.672
Sitting in his car.
He was just watching me.

28:42.763 --> 28:43.764
Hayes!

28:47.059 --> 28:48.060
Hayes!

28:53.733 --> 28:54.734
<i>No, thank you.</i>

28:54.817 --> 28:58.237
<i>I left my number before and Mr. Fidlow
has never returned my phone call.</i>

28:58.446 --> 29:00.573
<i>- What was that name again?</i>
- Carter Hayes.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.658
H-A-Y-E-S.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.577
I've left you
all this information before.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.872
<i>Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We do not have a client by that name.</i>

29:08.122 --> 29:10.374
Well, maybe...
Maybe you can explain to me

29:10.458 --> 29:13.043
how it is Mr. Fidlow
doesn't know a Carter Hayes

29:13.127 --> 29:16.505
when Mr. Hayes, who's locked himself
into my goddamn apartment

29:16.589 --> 29:17.798
and hasn't paid me any rent

29:18.090 --> 29:20.342
keeps telling me to call
his goddamn attorney

29:20.426 --> 29:23.345
Bennett Fidlow
in San-Fucking-Antonio, Texas.

29:24.847 --> 29:25.848
Hello?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.851
Hello!

29:29.101 --> 29:32.688
Okay. What's the most important thing
I said to remember when we're riding?

29:33.272 --> 29:34.648
We're the boss.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.776
That's right.
And why are we the boss?

29:36.984 --> 29:38.402
Because we're smarter.

29:38.486 --> 29:39.653
Absolutely.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.618
Okay. That's enough for today. Dismount.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.037
- Can you take over, Jana?
- Okay.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.331
Hi.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.267
Put your reigns
in your right hand.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.731
Stay on the left side of your horse.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.544
You look so serious.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.588
Rough day at work.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.524
It's a kite-eat-kite world
out there, Patty.

30:00.674 --> 30:03.314
You know, I was... I was thinking
maybe we could sneak out tonight.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.221
I made a reservation
down at Mama Chan's.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.597
I don't know if I'm up to it.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.266
Ah, a bottle of wine,
a nice dinner. It'll do us both good.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.560
I went to the doctor's today.

30:11.894 --> 30:12.895
Why?

30:13.229 --> 30:15.773
Well, I can't seem to shake
this flu that I've been fighting,

30:15.856 --> 30:18.984
so, I figured I'd just
make an appointment and go.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.778
What did he say?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.446
It's definitely not the flu.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.781
Well, that's good then.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.625
You know, maybe we'd both feel better
if we went out and had some fun.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.494
Hayes' rent didn't come, did it?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.705
No. Tomorrow, probably.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.041
- Probably?
- Yeah, it's a bank mix up.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.393
Look, I'm on top of it.
Don't worry about it.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.544
- Drake...
- Look.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.963
I got us into this, Patty.
I'm gonna get us out of it.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.130
End of discussion.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.174
End of discussion?

30:45.511 --> 30:48.013
The doctor says I'm pregnant.

30:53.644 --> 30:54.812
Oh, uh...

30:57.147 --> 30:58.399
Congratulations.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.194
Thanks.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.598
- Hello.
<i>- Uh, Ms. Palmer?</i>

31:30.681 --> 31:31.807
Yeah, who is this?

31:37.271 --> 31:39.440
- Yeah?
- I come here and knock,

31:39.523 --> 31:41.692
nobody answers. Hammering stops.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.903
I go back. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

31:47.448 --> 31:48.699
I don't like this guy.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.829
It's Drake Goodman,
your landlord. May I come in?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.704
Look, I know you're in there.
I can hear you in there.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.938
I've got a key.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.405
So if you don't open the door,
I'm just gonna come in anyway.

32:13.766 --> 32:14.934
He's changed the locks.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.687
You changed the fucking locks!

32:45.631 --> 32:46.715
Ah!

32:50.636 --> 32:52.721
Yeah! Good night.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.703
I don't care if he comes through
with the money now or not.

33:16.537 --> 33:17.579
I just want him out.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.581
No harm, no foul.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.042
He leaves right away,
he doesn't owe us anything.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.878
Goodbye. Good riddance.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.881
Now what?

33:29.133 --> 33:30.551
Jesus...

33:36.807 --> 33:37.975
Yes, who is it?

33:38.726 --> 33:40.766
<i>San Francisco Police Department.</i>

33:40.853 --> 33:43.689
They were doing construction
at 2-fucking-30 in the morning!

33:43.772 --> 33:44.982
They won't answer the door!

33:45.190 --> 33:46.650
I can't use my key to get in,

33:46.734 --> 33:48.569
because they've changed
all the fucking locks!

33:48.652 --> 33:49.754
- Drake...
- I don't appreciate

33:49.778 --> 33:51.113
foul language, sir.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.865
May I say something?

33:53.198 --> 33:55.802
My friend is a sculptor, and he was
working a little late last night.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.679
- I'm very sorry if he kept anyone up.
- Bullshit!

33:57.703 --> 33:58.704
You back off!

33:58.787 --> 34:00.664
Look, he hasn't
even paid his rent. Ask him.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.976
Apparently, there has been
a mix up in the wire transfer

34:03.000 --> 34:04.519
of my money to San Francisco. I'm sorry.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.462
They moved in there,
they changed all the locks,

34:06.754 --> 34:09.172
so I can't see what he
and his little buddy are destroying.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.734
- I signed a lease.
- He hasn't paid the rent,

34:10.757 --> 34:12.842
or even a security fucking deposit!

34:12.926 --> 34:15.554
- Drake, take it easy.
- Look, I can handle this, Patty.

34:16.013 --> 34:17.572
- Fine.
- Listen, listen, listen.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.558
I understand why Mr. Goodman is upset.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.934
His bank lost my money,

34:21.018 --> 34:22.911
I was out of town.
The man's caught in the middle.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.376
I don't even wanna file a complaint.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.606
But I don't understand

34:25.773 --> 34:27.917
why he wouldn't give me
the opportunity to straighten things out

34:27.940 --> 34:29.252
unless he's found somebody
he'd rather rent...

34:29.275 --> 34:30.503
- This is such bullshit!
- Oh, come on.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.795
- Look, let's take a walk.
- Look, I just...

34:31.820 --> 34:34.364
- Now! Come on.
- I just want the guy to pay his rent!

34:34.447 --> 34:36.116
Come on, cool it down.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.161
What? What?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.996
What you did
is against the law.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.183
Well, my other tenant...

34:43.206 --> 34:45.127
Listen, Patty, I'm truly
sorry it's come to this.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.377
The bank shows me
that the money has been sent.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.838
- I didn't think Drake...
- I'd like you to not talk to me.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.107
Listen to me. Listen.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.217
I just want the guy
the hell out of my house!

34:53.300 --> 34:56.071
Well, then you better listen to me,
or he's gonna be so far up your butt,

34:56.094 --> 34:57.930
you're gonna be
pickin' him out your nose.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.766
Now I want you to turn back on

35:00.849 --> 35:03.018
all the heat and all the power
to this man's apartment.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.812
You apologize,

35:04.895 --> 35:07.481
and you do not, and I emphasize, do not,

35:07.564 --> 35:08.732
harass him again.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.652
Then go out and get yourself a lawyer.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.238
'Cause according
to California Civil Code,

35:14.321 --> 35:16.990
Mr. Hayes can sue you
for this stunt you just pulled.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.659
And most likely, he'll win.

35:19.368 --> 35:20.929
He... He doesn't even
have a right to be in that apartment...

35:20.953 --> 35:21.954
Are you listening to me?

35:22.037 --> 35:23.598
- He hasn't paid the rent!
- Are you listening to me?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.291
If he's in, he's got rights.
That's how it works.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.434
And I'll tell you
something else, friend.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.379
If he decides to fight an eviction,

35:30.754 --> 35:32.798
you're already knee-deep in shit.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.258
Get a lawyer.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.804
<i>He's taken possession.</i>

35:39.012 --> 35:40.430
<i>So, whether he signed a lease,</i>

35:40.514 --> 35:42.266
<i>or whether he paid you money or not,</i>

35:42.349 --> 35:44.351
<i>he's legally your tenant now.</i>

35:44.685 --> 35:47.020
<i>And he's protected by laws that say</i>

35:47.104 --> 35:50.524
<i>you have to go to court and prove
that he deserves to be evicted.</i>

35:50.941 --> 35:53.277
However, the net effect of these laws,

35:53.360 --> 35:56.780
is to protect any pointy-headed cretin

35:56.864 --> 35:58.740
who moves into your property,

35:59.199 --> 36:03.203
and slowly drives you
bankrupt and insane.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.914
So, what do we do?

36:06.707 --> 36:08.375
I can take on the case.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.794
What are our chances of winning?

36:10.961 --> 36:12.462
No guarantees...

36:12.546 --> 36:15.132
Er, my base fee for an uncontested case

36:15.215 --> 36:16.758
is $250.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.136
We charge $90 and hour thereafter,

36:19.219 --> 36:22.306
and a minimum of $360,

36:22.389 --> 36:24.016
for any court appearances.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.475
How long will it take?

36:25.559 --> 36:27.311
Uncontested, six to eight weeks.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.396
- If he contests?
- Six to eight months

36:29.646 --> 36:31.607
worst case. And then
you have to go after him

36:31.690 --> 36:33.192
in court again to collect.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.527
Wouldn't it just be a lot
easier to throw him out?

36:35.611 --> 36:37.362
Easy and wrong.

36:37.446 --> 36:40.824
This is the process, folks.
There aren't any shortcuts.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.328
<i>I need a description of
Hayes for Mr. Revilla,</i>

36:44.411 --> 36:47.414
<i>my process server
and I need the key to your front door.</i>

36:55.005 --> 36:56.798
- Is, uh, Carter Hayes in?
- No.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.647
I have some important
documents for him...

37:00.677 --> 37:02.304
Okay.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.597
All right.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.850
Get it shined, get them
shined, shine 'em up.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.828
Buddy, you need to get
in that bank and get a loan.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.062
Look at them shoes.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.398
All right, low-investment loans
for people like shoes like yours.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.400
Come here, get a good shine, right here.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.152
I'll put a glow on that coat.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.528
All right, who's next?

37:18.612 --> 37:20.239
Ladies and skirts, half price.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.365
Come here, sunshine.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.201
Get that half-price special
right here on that Dr. Shoe Love.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.370
Get it shined, get them shined, yeah.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.664
Shine 'em up, shine 'em up.
Where you going?

37:46.181 --> 37:48.501
<i>All right, all right.
Let me just guess what this is.</i>

37:49.142 --> 37:50.462
<i>As much as we'd like to help you,</i>

37:50.519 --> 37:52.688
we just can't afford
to string out the loan.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.291
It wouldn't be fair to us,
and it wouldn't be fair to you, right?

37:55.315 --> 37:56.650
- Right.
- They tell you the bank

37:56.733 --> 38:00.821
is pulling for you. That no one wants to
foreclose a loan... They tell you that?

38:01.905 --> 38:03.991
That's horsepucky. Bankerspeak.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.410
So, what... what do we do now, Reed?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.912
I can loan you maybe a grand,
but that's not gonna help.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.247
Not gonna do it.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.749
There are alternative lenders, you know.

38:12.916 --> 38:16.044
High interest houses that
specialize in burying it.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.755
"Let a smile be your umbrella."

38:18.839 --> 38:20.090
Great.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.385
- I could start riding again.
- Oh, that's a good idea, Patty.

38:23.844 --> 38:25.387
You're pregnant with a blown knee.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.323
You seriously think
that you could ride a horse...

38:27.347 --> 38:29.187
Wait a minute,
wait a minute. Are you pregnant?

38:29.266 --> 38:30.642
My knee is fine.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.436
And I don't have to be pregnant.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.937
Look, I'm not going to lose you,

38:34.021 --> 38:35.261
I'm not going to lose our child

38:35.314 --> 38:36.898
and I'm not going to lose our house.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.696
Well, I guess we can
just stop worrying now.

39:02.716 --> 39:04.009
Who is this?

39:04.843 --> 39:06.303
"Dear Drake and Patty, I'm so sorry

39:06.386 --> 39:09.222
"for the misunderstanding
that has come between us.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.640
"Please accept this gift

39:10.724 --> 39:13.143
"in my sincere hope
that we can work everything out.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.311
"Carter Hayes."

39:34.581 --> 39:36.500
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty,

39:36.583 --> 39:39.669
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty...

40:18.875 --> 40:21.086
Mrs. Patty, Mrs. Patty!

40:21.169 --> 40:23.130
What, Mrs. Watanabe?

40:23.213 --> 40:24.982
- Watch in the kitchen. The kitchen...
- What?

40:29.761 --> 40:33.223
Okay. Okay.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.850
In here? What?

40:38.395 --> 40:40.939
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

40:42.357 --> 40:44.109
Oh!

40:47.821 --> 40:50.824
The San Francisco roach,
generally German,

40:50.991 --> 40:52.784
or Oriental in derivation.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.453
With your krauts edging out

40:54.536 --> 40:57.122
your rice grinders
in the overall disgustingness factor.

40:57.539 --> 40:58.874
I think these were American.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.060
How are we supposed to pay for this?

41:01.084 --> 41:02.444
We're $1,100 short this morning...

41:02.502 --> 41:03.795
Don't yell at me.

41:04.504 --> 41:07.591
If we don't do it, MacDonald
says we lose the eviction.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.468
We can't afford that either.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.262
- Maybe we should borrow money for this.
- No!

41:12.345 --> 41:13.930
No, we're not gonna borrow money.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.892
This is stupid! We should
just let this building go.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.911
Oh, okay, fine!

41:18.935 --> 41:20.375
You can do whatever you want.

41:20.479 --> 41:23.064
I'm not letting any jerk
chase me out of my own property.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.709
It's
the promiscuity factor

41:24.733 --> 41:26.293
that makes it harder to hammer it down.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.112
I'll be using your
chlorpyrifos and pyrethrin

41:29.196 --> 41:31.031
in a high pressure injection system.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.033
I've also got the RSU.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.243
- What's that?
- Roach Sucking Unit.

41:36.036 --> 41:37.078
It's just a backup.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.082
Oh...

41:45.629 --> 41:46.949
They're coming in from next door!

41:48.048 --> 41:49.466
Oh, shit!

41:50.550 --> 41:52.511
Call reinforcements. Holy shit.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.432
They're probably camped out
in the other apartment.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.243
If we could go at it from over there,

41:59.267 --> 42:01.061
we'd have
a better chance of containment.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.521
What if we can't?

42:02.687 --> 42:05.774
Get a whole bunch of little
tiny leashes and pretend they're pets.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.415
I'm sorry.

42:25.168 --> 42:26.169
You know...

42:38.431 --> 42:39.432
Our luck

42:40.392 --> 42:41.768
has gotta change tomorrow.

42:47.566 --> 42:48.567
Maybe.

43:05.709 --> 43:07.752
- Hello?
- Carter Hayes lives here, doesn't he?

43:08.003 --> 43:09.043
Yes.

43:09.129 --> 43:11.566
Yeah, well, do you know if he's in?
Because I've been ringing the buzzer

43:11.590 --> 43:12.733
and there doesn't seem
to be any answer in there.

43:12.757 --> 43:13.758
I don't know.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.154
- Is Carter Hayes in there?
- Uh, no, he's not here.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.222
Look, I'm Ann.
Did he tell you about me?

43:19.472 --> 43:21.933
He must've told you about me.
Ann from the desert?

43:22.225 --> 43:24.495
Look, I've been drivin' all night,
and I don't have time for this shit.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.913
Now, I know that he's in there
and I'm not leaving

43:25.937 --> 43:27.498
- until I talk to him...
- Why don't you come in here, okay?

43:27.522 --> 43:29.190
Let go of me. What are you...

43:29.441 --> 43:30.543
- Shut up!
- Are you his partner?

43:30.567 --> 43:31.836
- Shut up!
- Are you his partner?

43:31.860 --> 43:32.920
That's none of your business!

43:32.944 --> 43:34.171
- I need to talk to him.
- About what?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.235
Come on,
you're not that stupid, figure it out.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.843
No, I'm sorry. It was a gift.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.596
Is anything pure gold,
14 karat gold?

43:59.679 --> 44:03.350
I... I have no knowledge
of jewelry. I just... I'm sorry.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.186
I just need money, desperately.

44:07.771 --> 44:08.813
Next!

44:13.151 --> 44:14.378
All right, what have we got?

44:14.402 --> 44:17.989
The only way I can swing it is
if you deposit $5,800 with us.

44:18.198 --> 44:20.492
If you do that, I can give you $5,000.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.494
That's what we call a secured loan.

44:22.577 --> 44:25.330
You'll probably get the money
in a couple of days. No qualifying.

44:25.538 --> 44:29.167
If I have $5,800, I wouldn't
need to borrow anything!

44:29.542 --> 44:30.543
Right.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.064
Well, I guess we won't be
doing any business then.

44:33.088 --> 44:35.090
Wait a minute. Your ad
in the <i>Yellow Pages...</i>

44:35.173 --> 44:37.926
Your ad said
that you give high-risk loans.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.803
That you specialize in giving loans

44:39.886 --> 44:41.763
to people who can't get a loan
any place else.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.015
Lady, don't believe
everything you read, okay?

44:44.099 --> 44:47.310
I've gone through
the figures three times. I cannot do it.

44:47.394 --> 44:50.980
All I'm asking for is $5,000 to get us
through the next few months.

44:51.272 --> 44:55.193
You have a $750,000
piece of property here.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.237
Sell your building and keep the change.

44:57.821 --> 44:59.280
I can't sell the building.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.450
- Is she done yet?
- She's done.

45:43.283 --> 45:44.802
Is there something
you wanna tell me, man?

45:44.826 --> 45:45.994
What do you mean?

45:47.245 --> 45:49.885
I think there's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, Carter.

45:50.039 --> 45:51.892
I'm sure there's a lot
of stuff I'm not telling you.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.561
Your girlfriend
came by the other day.

45:53.585 --> 45:54.586
So?

45:54.669 --> 45:57.839
So she told me
that the two of you made 250 grand

45:57.922 --> 45:59.549
on a real estate deal like this

45:59.632 --> 46:01.050
and she didn't see any of it.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.011
She's mistaken.

46:03.219 --> 46:05.054
She's a useless bitch anyway.

46:05.138 --> 46:08.391
She was paid. She didn't even have to do
anything. I had the whole thing wired.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.894
Listen to me and listen
to me carefully, okay?

46:11.060 --> 46:12.228
This is my business.

46:12.353 --> 46:13.813
And I'm very good at it, Greg.

46:13.938 --> 46:14.939
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:15.023 --> 46:16.625
Well, then how come
we're getting evicted so soon?

46:16.649 --> 46:17.960
- You said, man, that...
- That's not an issue.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.044
...that wasn't going to happen.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.379
I told you from the fucking get-go,

46:20.403 --> 46:23.090
there was gonna be certain risks
involved and you have to be flexible.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.866
Yeah, well don't
bullshit me, Carter!

46:24.949 --> 46:26.051
What are you talking about?

46:26.075 --> 46:28.077
Look, I just want you
to know that I know, man.

46:28.161 --> 46:29.680
- If you try and cut me out...
- What, Greg?

46:29.704 --> 46:30.914
Just don't do it!

46:30.997 --> 46:32.582
Or what?

46:33.249 --> 46:34.334
Ahhh! God!

47:13.998 --> 47:14.999
Drake?

47:15.542 --> 47:16.543
Drake!

47:17.794 --> 47:19.254
- Drake?
- What?

47:19.337 --> 47:20.463
Oh, God...

47:20.547 --> 47:22.924
I almost ran over that
guy from downstairs.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.176
I thought maybe you'd
gotten in a fight with him.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.886
They've got our cat down there.

47:26.970 --> 47:28.847
And they're, uh, breeding roaches.

47:29.556 --> 47:32.725
Apparently, screwing people
over is just a job to them.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.312
What are you talking about?

47:36.396 --> 47:38.189
Isn't that the best? I mean,

47:38.439 --> 47:40.275
our life is coming apart

47:40.692 --> 47:43.528
and this son of a bitch
just thinks it's business as usual.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.114
- Oh, Drake.
- This is what he does for a living.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.198
You're drunk.

47:47.574 --> 47:48.908
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:49.868 --> 47:51.619
- What?
- You'll like this too.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.622
This was under the door when I came in.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.834
It's from the Watanabes.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.682
It's the noise
and the bugs and...

48:13.600 --> 48:15.310
And my wife, she can't sleep.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.061
Me...

48:17.478 --> 48:19.063
I'm so sorry, it's no good.

48:19.355 --> 48:22.025
You signed a lease
for one year, Mr. Watanabe.

48:22.150 --> 48:23.610
I will try to pay you back.

48:24.152 --> 48:27.238
Moving expense, new apartment expense...

48:27.655 --> 48:28.948
Lots of expense.

48:29.699 --> 48:31.993
You can take me to court, sue me, but...

48:33.119 --> 48:34.203
So sorry.

48:35.955 --> 48:37.040
I'm so sorry.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.543
Well...

48:42.128 --> 48:44.172
I guess there's nothing else to say.

48:45.632 --> 48:46.758
Good fortune.

48:48.217 --> 48:49.218
Yeah.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.690
In answer to your
suit against him,

49:02.815 --> 49:04.734
Mr. Hayes has submitted to the court

49:05.151 --> 49:06.945
affidavits A and B

49:07.362 --> 49:08.780
confirming plaintive attempted

49:08.863 --> 49:10.823
unlawful eviction of a Mr. Hayes

49:11.157 --> 49:12.951
on the 15th of last May.

49:13.993 --> 49:16.496
I turned the gas and electricity off.
There was a policeman...

49:16.579 --> 49:17.806
Your... Your Honor, my client's and I...

49:17.830 --> 49:19.725
Ms. MacDonald, I assume
you've received these documents?

49:19.749 --> 49:21.060
Yes, I have just received
them, Your Honor.

49:21.084 --> 49:22.144
I think there's been a mix up.

49:22.168 --> 49:24.879
I think the law's
quite clear on this point. Don't you?

49:25.254 --> 49:27.215
Mr. Hayes is entitled
to a reduction of rent

49:27.298 --> 49:28.549
due to uninhabitability

49:28.758 --> 49:30.843
caused by Mr. Goodman's
misguided attempt

49:30.927 --> 49:34.055
to force him from the premises
by disconnecting his utilities.

49:35.515 --> 49:37.934
Court rules
for the defendant, Carter Hayes.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.262
And let the records show,
that according to the lease,

49:40.436 --> 49:43.106
Mr. Hayes' legal cost
is to be paid by the plaintiff.

49:43.189 --> 49:45.589
Your Honor, I would like to ask
for a 10-minute postponement.

49:45.858 --> 49:48.820
Ms. MacDonald, I see where you have
other cases before this Court today.

49:48.903 --> 49:50.503
I hope you are better prepared for them.

49:50.571 --> 49:51.757
I assume you'll wanna cooperate

49:51.781 --> 49:53.501
with the bench now
in keeping things moving?

49:54.200 --> 49:55.240
Yes, sir.

49:58.287 --> 49:59.288
That's it?

50:00.164 --> 50:02.125
Why didn't you tell me
you tried to force him out?

50:02.417 --> 50:03.543
I didn't think it mattered.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.919
You set us back months!

50:05.003 --> 50:06.004
He's lying!

50:06.212 --> 50:09.257
This guy has been playing
you like a piano concerto.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.175
Me? What about you?

50:11.426 --> 50:12.802
I got a guy livin' in my building

50:12.885 --> 50:14.470
who hasn't paid me one cent!

50:14.554 --> 50:17.056
Not only can't you get him out,
but now I owe him money?

50:17.724 --> 50:19.726
Maybe you'd like
to retain another attorney?

50:23.271 --> 50:24.272
Stephanie.

50:26.733 --> 50:27.817
Please don't quit.

50:28.151 --> 50:30.153
Drake's been under a lot of pressure.

50:30.236 --> 50:32.530
The bank is threatening
to foreclose on us.

50:32.697 --> 50:34.991
This isn't a moral question, Patricia.

50:35.074 --> 50:36.534
Morally, you're right.

50:36.784 --> 50:38.578
You win. Big deal.

50:39.037 --> 50:40.371
This is a game,

50:40.455 --> 50:42.498
and the object of the game
is to get Mr. Hayes

50:42.582 --> 50:45.376
out of your building before
he destroys your lives.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.312
He knows you're going
to get him out eventually.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.630
He's just trying
to stay there as long as he can.

50:50.089 --> 50:51.716
- Why?
- I don't know.

50:51.799 --> 50:53.426
Because it's possible.

50:53.509 --> 50:56.721
Because he's evil.
What difference does it make?

50:57.722 --> 50:59.182
It's nothing personal.

50:59.599 --> 51:01.601
God forbid he ever makes it personal.

51:17.033 --> 51:20.495
<i>Out of food out of time</i>

51:23.915 --> 51:26.250
<i>Those who live do not care</i>

51:30.546 --> 51:33.674
<i>A taste of war a taste of death</i>

51:35.134 --> 51:36.427
<i>Die!</i>

51:40.139 --> 51:41.682
Drake! Stop it!

51:44.393 --> 51:46.896
Drake, stop. Stop it! Stop it!

51:46.979 --> 51:48.523
- God damn it, Drake!
- What?

51:48.731 --> 51:50.483
What is happening to you?

51:50.650 --> 51:51.859
I want him out of here!

53:41.093 --> 53:42.094
Ahhh!

53:58.986 --> 53:59.987
Patty?

54:05.117 --> 54:06.118
Patty?

54:11.958 --> 54:14.168
Patty?

54:15.127 --> 54:16.712
Oh, God...

54:17.380 --> 54:18.464
Patty...

54:19.715 --> 54:20.716
Oh...

54:30.601 --> 54:32.478
Just a couple more tests for you.

54:32.853 --> 54:34.605
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:35.982 --> 54:37.108
How do you feel?

54:39.026 --> 54:40.861
I feel like Lady Macbeth.

54:41.988 --> 54:43.739
There was so much blood.

54:46.701 --> 54:48.119
Everything's gonna be all right.

54:49.870 --> 54:53.916
You know, the doctor says we can
even try again after a few months.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.985
<i>911 emergencies.</i>

56:03.194 --> 56:04.528
Give me the police, please.

56:09.325 --> 56:11.660
Something's got to change, Drake.

56:12.745 --> 56:16.040
You and me and this place,
it's just not working.

56:19.418 --> 56:20.419
Drake?

56:20.503 --> 56:22.380
What do you expect me
to say to that, Patty?

56:25.299 --> 56:26.926
Fine? Nice knowing you?

56:27.843 --> 56:28.844
Jesus.

56:28.928 --> 56:30.471
That's not what I meant.

56:32.264 --> 56:34.141
I don't know what I expect anymore.

56:34.225 --> 56:35.976
Maybe that's part of the problem.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.145
I'm sorry I talked you
into buyin' this place.

56:38.229 --> 56:40.231
You didn't talk me into anything.

56:45.861 --> 56:46.862
Patty...

56:48.989 --> 56:50.699
Something was right about us before.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.204
Whatever else has got screwed up,
we have to remember that.

57:05.381 --> 57:07.174
Hi, I didn't want to, uh...

57:08.092 --> 57:11.095
Intrude. But I heard
the ambulance last night

57:11.804 --> 57:14.181
and called the hospital.
They told me what happened.

57:15.891 --> 57:16.892
God...

57:17.685 --> 57:19.603
Nature can be so cruel sometimes.

57:21.105 --> 57:23.399
Anyway, Patty, I wanted
to offer my condolences.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.818
If there is anything at all
I can do to help...

57:29.780 --> 57:30.781
Ahhh!

57:30.865 --> 57:31.866
Drake!

57:37.830 --> 57:38.956
Drake.

57:40.082 --> 57:41.792
Drake, stop! Stop it!

57:42.418 --> 57:44.128
Drake, stop it! You're killing him.

57:44.211 --> 57:46.464
Stop it! Drake! God damn it...

57:55.806 --> 57:56.849
Stop it!

58:03.856 --> 58:04.857
Drake...

58:05.691 --> 58:07.043
Are you all right? Are you all right?

58:07.067 --> 58:08.736
I'm sorry, Patty.

58:10.029 --> 58:11.739
It's okay.

58:24.335 --> 58:26.521
- Let's go back in the house.
- No, no, no...

58:26.545 --> 58:29.173
No! Officer, hey, hey!

58:29.256 --> 58:30.299
Don't hurt him!

58:30.382 --> 58:31.800
What are you arresting me for?

58:32.218 --> 58:33.469
He didn't do anything!

58:33.552 --> 58:35.262
You have the right to remain silent.

58:35.346 --> 58:36.781
You have
the right to remain silent.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.891
He didn't do anything.
It was the other guy.

58:39.183 --> 58:40.434
Please don't hurt him.

58:40.518 --> 58:41.661
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

58:41.685 --> 58:42.853
and have an attorney present.

58:42.937 --> 58:44.939
You are arresting the wrong man!

58:45.147 --> 58:46.607
- Can I go with him?
- No.

58:47.483 --> 58:49.211
Keep struggling, I'll break
your goddamn arm.

58:49.235 --> 58:50.595
Watch your head.

58:53.656 --> 58:55.407
You got the wrong fucking man!

58:56.075 --> 58:57.618
You arrested the wrong man!

59:13.592 --> 59:16.192
There's nothing you can do
until the arraignment tomorrow morning.

59:17.096 --> 59:19.682
He needs a criminal law
specialist, Patricia.

59:19.765 --> 59:22.268
I'm out of my depth here.
I can recommend somebody.

59:22.851 --> 59:26.188
My guess is that Hayes
doesn't care about the criminal charges.

59:26.564 --> 59:28.983
He's gonna go after Drake
with a civil suit.

59:29.567 --> 59:32.736
This is what he wanted.
Game's over. Drake loses.

59:34.738 --> 59:35.948
Can I give you a ride home?

59:39.660 --> 59:41.579
What does this do to the eviction?

59:42.079 --> 59:44.331
Ironically, nothing. We'll get him out.

59:45.124 --> 59:46.875
Of course, Hayes might get the building

59:46.959 --> 59:49.878
before he's through
because of the civil suit.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.381
It's lucky you're not married,

59:52.464 --> 59:54.341
otherwise Drake
will pull you down with him.

59:57.303 --> 59:59.221
I had a miscarriage last night.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:02.391
I know.

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:08.897
I need to know
where Drake'll be staying.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:10.649
He'll be at home with me.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:14.403
Patty, Hayes is asking
for a temporary restraining order

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.529
because of the assault.

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:17.990
Drake can't come
within 500 feet of the building

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.199
as long as Hayes is there.

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.202
This is our home.

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:25.289
This is all happening to us in our home.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.373
I know.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:32.671
You want a hand?

01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:33.756
No, no. I got it.

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.012
Oh. I'll get some clean sheets.

01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:41.472
These look pretty rude.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:32.856
Hello.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.234
Hello?

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.610
<i>Patty.</i>

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.572
<i>You know...</i>

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.576
I think that
under different circumstances,

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:47.204
you and I
could've gotten to be good friends.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.384
<i>The time allotted
for you to dial has been exceeded.</i>

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.094
<i>Please hang up and dial again.</i>

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.596
<i>The time allotted
for you to dial has been exceeded.</i>

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.324
<i>Please hang up and dial again.</i>

01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:38.756
Get it started. Now watch this.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.633
<i>Voila.</i>

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:44.470
I'll get that.
Hang on, man. Don't burn the house down.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:48.724
Hello?

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.267
Hi, it's me. Um...

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:52.133
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:54.062
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:55.439
<i>Fine.</i>

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.399
It only hurts when I blink.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.069
- <i>Um...</i>
- Something wrong?

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.448
No, I... I just... I miss you.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.325
<i>Well, why don't you come over here?</i>

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.136
<i>Yeah, I mean, look, this is ridiculous.</i>

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.637
<i>Why don't you come over here
and spend the night?</i>

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.662
No, it's okay.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.916
- Um, somebody's gotta be here.
<i>- Nobody has to be there.</i>

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.418
<i>- Tell me what's wrong.</i>
- Everything's fine.

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:18.295
<i>- No, Patty.</i>
- I better...

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.131
- I'm better go. Don't worry.
<i>- Patty.</i>

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:22.508
- Bye.
<i>- Patty, you're not...</i>

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:40.335
You're a very brave
and stupid man.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.006
What are you doing, Drake?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.258
You can't come in here.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.765
Listen.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.977
Carter, it's no big deal.

01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:00.731
I just wanna go upstairs
and see Patty, okay?

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.192
But you're breaking the law, Drake.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.861
Wait a minute.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.161
Damn.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:29.885
Hi.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.098
I really screwed things up.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.062
I don't know
what I've been trying to prove.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.396
Shh. Don't talk.

01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:45.817
What was I trying to prove?

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:49.821
You don't have to prove anything.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:56.995
Go to sleep.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.832
I love you.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.001
I love you too.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.883
We have no case because Hayes
was technically within his right

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:10.968
to protect himself.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.678
I mean, Goodman threatens Hayes

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:13.929
who fearing for his life,

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:17.265
justifiably, based upon the previous
assault complaint, defends himself.

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:19.685
You're the DA, Henry. Make a case.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.062
There's a history
of mutual animosity here.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.690
There's a history
of Goodman assaulting Hayes.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:27.567
I can make a case
but I can't win it, what's the point?

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:30.153
- They're a nice couple.
- Right.

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:33.490
Well, at least
the default judgment came through today.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:36.034
We're evicting
that son of a bitch tomorrow.

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.771
I'll need you to sign right here.

01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:42.374
Mr. Carter Hayes?

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.602
It's the sheriff's department,
Mr. Hayes.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:45.794
We've come to see you out.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:52.592
Appointed locksmith, Manford Bagel,
will facilitate entry at this point.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:19.745
Ooh.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.288
Whoa.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:37.596
Damn.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.599
God, this is bad.

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:42.809
How much can he make off of this crap?

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.359
God!

01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:00.636
Look, I don't have his name here.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.662
He's still probably
at the 3rd Street station.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:07.542
Gas stove, microwave, disposal,
dishwasher,

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.754
two sinks, one toilet?

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:16.134
Um, about how many
electrical fixtures would you guess?

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.261
I don't know.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.971
Okay, well, it's not important but, uh,

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:22.742
you know, we will need
it for your insurance.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.086
We're gonna need a complete list.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.810
The insurance was canceled.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:31.907
- Yeah.
<i>- Patricia Palmer still with you?</i>

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.544
- Yeah, she's right here.
<i>- I'd like to speak with her.</i>

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.653
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:37.279
Uh, that's my boss.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:41.660
Here you go.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.627
I recognized the name on the report.

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:53.380
You two know each other?

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.381
Bobby, why don't you take these upstairs

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:56.567
see if we can get a running start

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.510
on where this cretin
might fence the appliances.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.240
- Sure thing, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.662
I guess, you're wishing now
that you'd rented to the black man.

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.272
You never brought back your application.

01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:13.024
- Oh, I brought it back.
- I never got it.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:15.402
Uh-huh.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.988
The Porsche in your garage was leased.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:21.448
Hayes made one payment,
put stolen plates on it,

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.133
they've been looking for him ever since.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.537
I sent a tow over
to haul away what's left of it.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.622
He shot my boyfriend.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:30.207
I know. You're lucky he didn't kill him.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.170
This is a sick individual, Ms. Palmer.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.005
Be grateful he's out of your life.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.466
Right now, you don't
mean a thing to him. Leave it that way.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:40.719
If he's gonna get caught.
We'll catch him.

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:43.930
He shot my boyfriend.
My boyfriend is in the hospital.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.474
He destroyed our property.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:48.518
There are lawsuits,
there's the foreclosure,

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:49.935
I had a miscarriage.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.522
And you're telling me
to forget about him?

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.107
Next time, maybe he ain't so lucky.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:58.069
Next time, maybe he runs
into the man who blows his brains out.

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.321
Next time?

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.489
Let him go, Ms. Palmer.

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.609
Hi, Mr. Fidlow please.

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:39.486
<i>May I ask what it's concerning?</i>

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:41.947
It's regarding James Danforth.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.955
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- It's a Patricia Palmer on line one</i>

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:52.499
<i>- regarding James Danforth.</i>
- All right, put her through.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.128
How can I help ya?

01:10:57.212 --> 01:11:00.173
<i>Um, yeah, you represent
Charles and James Danforth.</i>

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:03.760
I'm an executor of a family trust

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:07.555
special conservatorship
benefiting James Danforth.

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:11.101
But this should not be confused
with being his attorney.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.478
- Whatever he's told you.
<i>- Mr. Fidlow, are you aware...</i>

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:16.356
And furthermore,
whatever James has done,

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.358
the trust can not be touched.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.278
And neither I,
nor his brother, can or will

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.571
be held accountable for his activities.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.199
You mean, his family
pays him to stay away?

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:29.828
<i>I'm afraid
I can't comment on that.</i>

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:31.329
Well, where is he now?

01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:33.999
<i>Look, you just best
let this sleeping dog lie.</i>

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.333
- Where...
<i>- Lady.</i>

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:38.670
<i>He's been
out of control for a long time.</i>

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.673
Well, maybe I should
just go to his brother directly.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.800
You can't touch him, Ms. Palmer.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.554
James has no assets.
The trust cannot be attached

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:51.099
and he is legally
severed from his family.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.809
<i>I don't want money, Mr. Fidlow.</i>

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:54.602
<i>I just wanna know where he is.</i>

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.355
He doesn't tell me where he is. Ever.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.399
<i>Well then, tell me where he's been.</i>

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:21.087
<i>He's far and away
the most intelligent man I've ever met.</i>

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:23.757
He's not your type.

01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:26.968
Oh, it's okay to want him,
it's a free country.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.263
I could tell, you know?
When I saw you up in Frisco,

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.599
I could tell you had a thing for him.

01:12:34.309 --> 01:12:35.810
Are you his type?

01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:38.104
What do you think?

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:43.568
I think, you're sitting here
waiting for him

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:45.779
and meanwhile, he's blown you off.

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.238
And it's pretty pathetic.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.532
You don't even know him.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.911
You don't even know his real name.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.163
It isn't Hayes, you know.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.625
It isn't Carter Hayes.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:03.755
Carter Hayes is the stupid old man
who owned this condo.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:06.716
He tried to throw us out,

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.886
he sent his tough guys
after us to rough us up.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.140
But now, look who's here
and look who's not.

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:16.476
Your the pathetic one.

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:18.770
And he didn't blow me off.

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.441
He sent me a postcard just yesterday.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:25.276
Read it.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:28.113
He's not like anyone else.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.864
He does whatever he wants.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.409
We understand each other.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.494
That's what we have.

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:37.580
You?

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:40.959
You're just chasing a shadow.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:01.062
Yes, Andre. I need it delivered
immediately to room 1550.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.314
Excuse me?

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.443
Yes, thank you.

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:09.070
Do you have
someone named Carter Hayes staying here?

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:10.822
Hayes? I'll check.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.785
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:19.539
How about Goodman? Drake Goodman.

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:20.999
Goodman?

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:23.418
I'll check.

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:29.382
We do, but I see that he's out.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.760
Oh. Well, um...

01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:35.221
He left this in the store where I work.

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:37.472
- Do you think you can give it to him?
- Certainly.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.868
Would you care to leave
your name or number...

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:39.893
No, thank you.

01:14:42.437 --> 01:14:43.605
Front desk. Victor.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.324
Hello?

01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:19.432
- Uh, room 81.
- Special delivery.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.597
- It's not yet arrived.
- Yes, uh...

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.939
- Uh, room 81.
- Special delivery...

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.107
- Great.
- ...not yet arrived.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:30.985
Not here.

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:35.573
- It must to be...
- Special delivery is not here.

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:36.800
- Not arrived?
- Hi.

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:37.904
- Sure?
- Hi.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.638
- Bye. Bye-bye.
- Later on.

01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:42.038
- Yes.
- Later.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.916
- 1031.
- 1031.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.503
- Mr. Goodman?
- That's right.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:49.963
- Uh, no messages.
- Okay.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.382
Oh, a young woman
returned your wallet, sir.

01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:53.859
- Pardon me?
- She said she found it

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.176
in the store where she works.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.428
Oh, yeah. Great. Thanks.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.566
- Mr. Goodman, how are you?
- Hi, Heidi. How are you?

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:52.775
Come on in.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.008
Excuse me.

01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:42.427
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:45.012
I was just wondering
if you could let me into my room.

01:18:45.096 --> 01:18:47.598
My dumb husband has locked me out
and I thought, you know...

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:48.933
Which room?

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.935
1031, Goodman.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:00.778
Okay.

01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:05.116
Thank you so much.

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:07.702
I didn't know
what I was gonna do. Thanks a lot.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.078
Okay.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:20.024
Oh, God.

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:44.006
That damn son of a bitch!

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.430
God damn motherfucker!

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.482
Is everything okay?

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:03.150
Yes.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.158
Hello.

01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:12.719
<i>Oh, good.
I'm so glad you're home.</i>

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:13.995
You're not. Where are you?

01:21:14.245 --> 01:21:16.330
<i>- You went after him, didn't you?</i>
- Absolutely.

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:19.625
Look, I don't have much time
and I need you to help me, okay?

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.335
Call and cancel all your credit cards.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.629
Hayes is using duplicates
with your name on it.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:25.381
<i>- Oh, great.</i>
- Then call the bank

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.383
- and put a hold on our checking account.
<i>- Why?</i>

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:30.845
There's a 24-hour hotline,
I think the number's on top of...

01:21:30.928 --> 01:21:32.805
<i>It's on top
of the last bank statement, I know.</i>

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:33.973
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.058
Something that's
gonna make us feel really good.

01:21:36.142 --> 01:21:38.811
<i>- Well, be careful.</i>
- I'll be back tonight. Bye.

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:44.775
<i>Hello, Room Service. Gary speaking.</i>

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:48.362
- Hi, this is Mrs. Goodman in room 1031.
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:51.157
Yeah, my husband and I
would like to have a small dinner party

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.867
up here, tonight. Charge it to the room.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:54.619
<i>Of course. What would you like?</i>

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:56.871
Um, let's see,
I'd like have a vichyssoise.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:57.997
<i>Vichyssoise.</i>

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.800
- And Caesar salad and filet mignon.
<i>- Caesar salad and filet mignon.</i>

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.978
Oh, and what do you have
for dessert? Do you have...

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:04.170
Do you have crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e?

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.297
<i>Of course, we do, yes,
with raspberry sauce.</i>

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.507
- Oh, that sounds really good.
<i>- Yes, it's very good.</i>

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.051
<i>What beverage would you like?</i>

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:12.470
- Well, we'll need a full bar and...
<i>- Full bar?</i>

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:13.971
Um, coffee with the desert.

01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:16.182
<i>Of course.
And how many people is this for?</i>

01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:17.892
- Eighteen.
<i>- Eighteen?</i>

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:21.479
- Mmm-hmm. And how long will that be?
<i>- At least two hours.</i>

01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:24.732
- Two hours? Can you put a rush on it?
<i>- Oh, we try, we try, yes.</i>

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.442
Great. By the way,

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.611
it's our anniversary today,

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.405
and my husband would like
to send a bottle of champagne

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:33.407
to everybody staying on the 10th floor.

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:35.618
<i>- Everyone on the 10th floor?</i>
- Mmm.

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.994
<i>That's very generous.</i>

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:40.289
Well, that's the kind of man
that he is.

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:41.958
Thank you.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:51.068
- Good evening, Victor.
- Good evening, Mr. Goodman.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:52.093
Any messages?

01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:53.177
1031.

01:22:54.679 --> 01:22:55.930
No messages.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.724
Mr. Goodman, may I please
have a word with you?

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:02.853
I'm sorry to trouble you, sir

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:05.940
but we seem to be having
a problem with your credit card.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:07.733
Really?

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:09.193
What kind of problem?

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.820
This is Lieutenant Palmer

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.655
from the San Francisco
Police Department.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:13.966
<i>- Yes, ma'am. Can I help you?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:17.660
I was wondering if you leased
a black Cadillac Coupe de Ville

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:22.456
with the license plate number 2PET764

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.543
- to a man named Drake Goodman.
<i>- Let me check.</i>

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.337
<i>- Yes, we did. Why?</i>
- You did?

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:32.008
Well, there are some things that I think
you might be interested in knowing.

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:34.027
Well, listen, why don't I
just write you a check,

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.196
to take care of things
'till we get this straightened out.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.848
I don't... That wouldn't
be acceptable. I'm sorry.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.225
- We called your bank, as a backup?
- Yeah.

01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:43.519
They said that your account
has been frozen.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.872
<i>Yes, I'd like to report
some stolen travelers checks.</i>

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:46.897
<i>Lost or stolen?</i>

01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:49.233
No, no, my husband is certain
that they've been stolen.

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.318
<i>- Stolen.</i>
- Mmm-hmm. All 30 of them.

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:54.613
Well, I assumed you got the
necessary approval when I checked in.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:58.325
Well, yes. But when a customer
charges over $100 to their room

01:23:58.409 --> 01:23:59.744
we generally run a card again

01:23:59.827 --> 01:24:02.329
for approval and that's when
we discovered the problem.

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:03.932
Right, except, I didn't charge
anything to my room.

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:06.667
It's probably
a clerical error on their part.

01:24:06.751 --> 01:24:09.253
But we just have to look out
for ourselves, you understand?

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:10.647
I didn't charge anything to my room.

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:13.924
- Well, maybe it was your wife.
- My wife?

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:30.417
Come on.

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:58.779
- Mr. Goodman, excuse me Mr. Goodman...
- No, not now.

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:00.656
- ...I really, excuse me.
- Taxi.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:03.826
- I really cannot allow you...
- Evening ma'am.

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:08.080
Mr. Goodman, the hotel
has a very strict policy in this matter.

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:11.208
We will... I assure you we will take
the necessary steps immediately.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:14.044
Mr. Goodman, we will call the police!

01:26:41.906 --> 01:26:42.907
They're lying.

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:46.660
These people are completely
pathological.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:50.664
They took a half a year's rent
from me and said I never paid them.

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:53.834
They evicted me, they slandered me,

01:26:53.918 --> 01:26:55.336
they totally destroyed my credit.

01:26:57.755 --> 01:26:59.381
They physically assaulted me.

01:26:59.465 --> 01:27:00.716
They threatened my life.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:03.844
And now this.

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:07.056
These people are parasites.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:10.434
Florence.

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:12.519
I am so sorry...

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:15.231
That you were
even touched by any of this.

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.525
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.

01:27:20.611 --> 01:27:23.447
When I first met you
I was enchanted, and I...

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:26.951
I was dazzled.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:29.828
I'm sorry.

01:27:31.247 --> 01:27:32.974
You know it's not like
I can't prove they're lying.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.667
I can prove they're lying.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.127
It's gonna take a little time.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.147
I'll have to take them to court I guess.

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.507
But for right now
it's my word against theirs, isn't it?

01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:45.052
I don't know what these people want.

01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:52.101
You know that if they
hadn't tied-up my trust

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.061
I would never ask you for anything.

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:56.063
But if the bail isn't paid

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.564
I can't get out of here.

01:27:57.648 --> 01:27:59.441
And I cannot prove to you, sir,

01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:02.736
what I hope Florence
already knows in her heart.

01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:06.573
At least I would hope, that you know.

01:28:09.243 --> 01:28:10.244
Look.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.080
I'm just asking you to do

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.958
whatever it is
your heart tells you to do.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:47.239
Oh, not again.

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:58.625
<i>TV 20</i>

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.295
<i>And now one of

<i>David, hi, this is Mary.</i>

<i>- Well, hi Mary, where you calling from?
- I'm calling from Santa Fe.</i>

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:15.327
<i>Santa Fe, well, this desk set
is perfect for you, isn't it?</i>

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:18.645
<i>- David, I just love this. I got three.

<i>Oh, you got a great buy on these,
and you know they're only $54 right now.</i>

01:29:22.316 --> 01:29:24.597
<i>- I know that.
- Isn't this unbelievable?</i>

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.129
<i>Yeah. You know,
I have varicose veins</i>

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:27.339
<i>and I hate to shop at malls.
I really...</i>

01:29:27.363 --> 01:29:28.364
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:30.574
<i>This is perfect. I can pull out my VISA,</i>

01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:32.326
<i>dial the phone. It's great, David.</i>

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:34.721
<i>Well, Mary, you just
prop up your feet and relax and</i>

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:37.026
<i>enjoy yourself and keep on shopping.</i>

01:29:37.331 --> 01:29:39.651
<i>Okay, you guys,
stay here and keep me covered.</i>

<i>I think we're falling</i>

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:12.366
<i>From composure...</i>

Kitty?

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:52.739
Kitty?

01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:03.876
Kitty?

01:31:13.427 --> 01:31:14.428
Kitty?

01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:31.820
<i>Put your hands away</i>

01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:35.532
<i>Put your hands away</i>

<i>Put your hands away...</i>

<i>Gonna kill your mother...</i>

Kitty, you bad cat. Where have you been?

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.811
You scared me
to death down there.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:07.689
Kitty, kitty.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.775
Kitty.

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:14.988
Kitty?

01:32:22.955 --> 01:32:24.122
You crossed the line.

01:32:25.249 --> 01:32:26.518
You were in my room.

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:28.043
You were in my private things.

01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:34.716
You and your boyfriend.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:39.137
You insulted my intelligence.

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.057
You got into my area.

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:46.103
What you doing?

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.188
No! No!

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:49.731
Ow!

01:32:49.815 --> 01:32:51.984
How am I gonna make a living now?

01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:53.527
What am I gonna tell my family?

01:32:53.986 --> 01:32:55.112
Huh?

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.032
Did you know
that half of all homicide victims

01:32:59.408 --> 01:33:00.848
are killed with their own hand guns?

01:33:00.993 --> 01:33:02.095
Did you know that?

01:33:02.119 --> 01:33:03.203
- No, no!
- Did you?

01:33:10.919 --> 01:33:11.920
Ow!

01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:16.675
What am I gonna do with you, Patty? Huh?

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.262
What are you making me do here?

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:25.267
Don't you know
I have responsibilities? Huh?

01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:27.728
I've got people, I've got my brother.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.105
I mean, I've got

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:33.025
a lot of people who depend on me.

01:33:35.444 --> 01:33:37.487
Then you come along.

01:33:37.904 --> 01:33:40.449
I mean, what was the point?

01:33:47.414 --> 01:33:49.666
How does it feel?

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:51.752
- Huh? Patty, did it feel good?
- No.

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:55.631
Is that it? When you're
in my private things spying on me.

01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.108
- It felt good, didn't it?
- No.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.258
- Yes it did.
- No.

01:33:58.342 --> 01:34:00.761
- You crossed the line and it felt good.
- No.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:03.305
- You're lying. You're lying.
- No.

01:34:10.187 --> 01:34:11.355
Get off me!

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.200
No.

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:25.077
Stop it. No.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:33.669
No.

01:35:31.685 --> 01:35:34.980
It's a Victorian.
It was built in 1883.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:37.441
Somebody remodeled it in the 40s.

01:35:37.691 --> 01:35:39.609
But we tried to restore it back

01:35:39.693 --> 01:35:42.279
to its original state
the best that we could.

01:35:42.571 --> 01:35:44.781
- Oh, you did all the work yourself?
- Yeah, most of it.

01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:47.242
You know how hard
it is to find packing boxes?

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:48.368
- Hi.
- Hi

01:35:48.452 --> 01:35:50.662
I actually had to buy these.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:53.039
Honey... This is Drake.
This is Bill and Amy.

01:35:53.123 --> 01:35:55.292
- Hi, Amy.
- Nice to meet you.

01:35:55.542 --> 01:35:56.626
We were just telling Patty,

01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:59.171
how impressed we are
with all the work you've done.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:00.314
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:02.466
So, you wanna buy the place?

01:36:02.549 --> 01:36:04.134
Well, uh,

01:36:04.426 --> 01:36:05.635
it's a little more money

01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:08.221
than we thought of originally
but it's great.

01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:09.991
Well, you know,
you've got the two rental units

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:11.349
to help make the mortgage.

01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:13.143
Yeah, well, we'd sure need it.

01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:15.437
Oh, honey, look at these floors.
They're gorgeous.

01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:16.480
Hmm.

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:19.775
- Yeah. Refinished.
- We, uh, just had them refinished.

01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:23.111
- Oh.
- Beautiful.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.600
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you.

01:36:24.738 --> 01:36:26.823
Why don't we leave you alone
to talk and...

01:36:27.491 --> 01:36:30.786
We'll be right upstairs
if you need us, packing. Okay?

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.496
- It's nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.957
- Patty.
- Yeah.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.386
Do you mind if I ask you
why you're selling?

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:40.354
I mean, you've done
so much to this place.

01:36:40.378 --> 01:36:41.922
You obviously put your heart in it.

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:46.009
No, not really.
It... It was just an investment.

01:36:58.188 --> 01:37:01.983
I know you love it,
but we're talking about $900,000.

01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:04.903
I bet we can offer
them an 850 or 825.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:06.655
Oh. Oh, that's all, okay.

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:08.031
Um.

01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.367
What if we don't qualify
for a bank loan?

01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:12.327
We will.

01:37:12.911 --> 01:37:15.511
First thing I'm gonna do is take
these curtains off these windows.

01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:19.709
Can we talk about the purchase price
before you redesign the entire place?

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.878
Well, I just have so many ideas.

01:37:24.548 --> 01:37:27.259
- It'll be okay.
- It'll be okay, huh?

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:31.721
- Well, as long as you say so.
- I know so.
