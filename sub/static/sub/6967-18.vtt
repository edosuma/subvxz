00:14.881 --> 00:16.439
Hurry and get him outta there!

00:18.084 --> 00:20.348
I need two men on the left side! Now!

00:21.421 --> 00:25.289
- Wait! Where are you going with him?
- He's dead.

00:25.392 --> 00:28.657
There's a woman over there who isn't
and she needs oxygen!

00:28.762 --> 00:33.426
Step back!
Sir, if you'll just cooperate here a little bit.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.438
- I want you to rise!
- Amen.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.377
Rise up and heal!

00:47.447 --> 00:50.280
- What are you doing?
- The boy's laying on hands.

00:51.484 --> 00:55.045
- Rise up and accept the miracle he has given.
- Amen. Hallelujah.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.090
You don't understand. The man's dead.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.293
Then the boy can't do any harm, can he?

01:01.394 --> 01:04.385
This is the power of belief.

01:04.464 --> 01:07.524
The power to separate
the light from the darkness,

01:07.634 --> 01:09.932
to create life from death.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.401
Amen.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.837
All right, everyone! Show's over!

01:13.940 --> 01:16.067
Let's clear the area!

01:31.424 --> 01:33.324
Hallelujah, Samuel.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.450
Hallelujah.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.271
Yes, indeedy! Oh, hallelujah!

02:29.215 --> 02:31.706
Hallelujah, brother! Praise God!

02:32.986 --> 02:34.681
Yes, indeedy! Praise God!

02:38.691 --> 02:41.751
- I want everybody to say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.523
Praise the Lord!

02:44.430 --> 02:48.298
The woman on the table
has a malignant tumor on her spine.

02:48.368 --> 02:53.237
This boy here is gonna attempt to heal her
by simply laying his hands on her.

02:53.339 --> 02:57.571
- Where'd you get this?
- From the regional office in Tennessee.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.204
- The preacher is...
- Reverend Calvin Hartley.

03:00.313 --> 03:03.840
- You've heard of him?
- The boy is his adopted son, Samuel.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.043
He says he found him as an infant

03:06.152 --> 03:09.053
lying in the weeds
on the banks of the Mississippi.

03:09.155 --> 03:12.249
He also claims the boy
brought a man back from the dead.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.952
It's more than a claim. The man he saved

03:15.061 --> 03:19.794
is an attraction in the reverend's tent
ministry. The boy's performed miracles

03:19.866 --> 03:22.334
every week for the past ten years.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.929
- Twice on Sunday.
- Not according to Kenwood's county sheriff.

03:26.039 --> 03:30.408
Local authorities think that
Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.876
They haven't been able to shut him down,

03:32.979 --> 03:36.142
so they've turned to the FBI
to try and get a prosecution.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.380
- For what? Fraud?
- No. Murder. Watch the tape.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.477
Lucy Kelly

03:41.588 --> 03:43.647
has the cancer.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.152
Her doctors say

03:46.226 --> 03:48.285
it is inoperable.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.954
They say it is incurable.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.396
But I say to you

03:53.466 --> 03:56.264
that what the doctors cannot cure

03:56.369 --> 03:58.428
the Lord can.

03:58.504 --> 04:01.667
Yes, indeedy, praise God! Because God

04:02.709 --> 04:05.576
can work... miracles.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.507
Today the clear light of God's healing love

04:11.884 --> 04:13.579
is flowing

04:13.653 --> 04:17.214
through Samuel's healing hands.

04:18.324 --> 04:22.784
20 minutes later, Lucy Kelly was rushed
to the hospital. She was dead on arrival.

04:22.862 --> 04:27.322
- What was the cause of death?
- I don't know, but it wasn't cancer.

04:27.433 --> 04:32.268
They've requested someone with a medical
background to assist in the investigation.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.899
- I know this isn't an X-File...
- When do we leave for Tennessee?

04:46.452 --> 04:49.751
I think I saw some of these
same people at Woodstock.

04:49.856 --> 04:52.154
Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.

04:52.258 --> 04:55.489
- I saw the movie.
- There you go.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.898
- Will you be all right by yourself?
- I'll be fine.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.667
I won't be long.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.482
Most of you here today
I know as neighbors

05:17.550 --> 05:21.987
and as cherished members
of our Miracle Ministry.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.852
But some of you have come from far away.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.983
As far away as

05:27.093 --> 05:29.891
Pensacola, Florida!

05:29.962 --> 05:32.192
And Uniondale, Long Island!

05:34.534 --> 05:37.128
And this is especially to

05:37.270 --> 05:39.329
those of you who come from so far,

05:40.373 --> 05:43.137
that I must apologize
from the bottom of my heart

05:44.544 --> 05:48.571
because, unfortunately,
Samuel cannot be here this afternoon.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.110
I know how very deeply disappointed

05:52.218 --> 05:54.516
each of you must be feeling right now.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.351
But I say unto you, do not be dismayed,

05:57.423 --> 06:00.620
do not despair, do not lose your hope!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.420
Because in two short days

06:03.529 --> 06:07.932
Samuel will be back here
at our very special Miracle Mission!

06:10.503 --> 06:13.131
Yes, indeedy, praise God!

06:13.239 --> 06:16.231
We should head backstage
and see what he has to say.

06:16.342 --> 06:19.607
No, wait. This is the part
where they bring out Elvis.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.237
As these people will testify,

06:22.348 --> 06:24.942
Samuel can heal you! Yes.

06:25.017 --> 06:27.110
Samuel will heal you!

06:27.854 --> 06:29.549
But...

06:31.157 --> 06:33.250
only if you believe.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.759
I believe, reverend! I believe!

06:35.828 --> 06:38.388
- Fine sermon, reverend.
- God bless you.

06:38.464 --> 06:41.262
Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI.

06:41.367 --> 06:44.029
I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.664
- We just want to talk to Samuel, that's all.
- He's not here.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.766
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.606
I haven't seen him.

06:52.678 --> 06:57.411
- The boy's been a bit troubled lately.
- We're running late, reverend.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.144
If you'll excuse me.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.999
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

07:22.074 --> 07:26.670
- Sheriff Daniels. We spoke on the phone.
- Yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

07:26.779 --> 07:31.113
- You wanted a copy of the coroner's report.
- Right. Thank you.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.846
I see you folks got a chance
to take in the Holy Roller sideshow.

07:34.921 --> 07:38.084
I take it you're not one of
the Reverend Hartley's flock.

07:38.191 --> 07:43.891
No, I remember Hartley when he was on his
soapbox collecting dollar bills in coffee cans.

07:43.996 --> 07:49.491
Since the boy joined the act, he's got himself
a Cadillac for every day of the week,

07:49.602 --> 07:53.003
bought for with money
that we need for roads and schools.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.597
People want to believe, you know?

07:55.675 --> 07:59.076
99%% % of the people in this world are fools.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.205
And the rest of us
are in great danger of contagion.

08:02.281 --> 08:07.548
Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still
a long way from accusing the boy of murder.

08:07.653 --> 08:12.022
I got witnesses that say the boy was laying
hands on those people when they died.

08:12.091 --> 08:15.151
You think that's how he killed them...
with a touch?

08:15.261 --> 08:17.252
I don't know how or why he did it.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.232
But we've been looking for him since
Tuesday and he does not wanna be found.

08:21.300 --> 08:26.033
There's nothing unusual about these reports,
except that no autopsies were performed.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.506
Hartley blocked my autopsy request
on religious grounds.

08:29.575 --> 08:33.739
Also doesn't help that the county coroner
is a member of the Miracle Ministry.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.509
Well, maybe we can arrange
to have the bodies exhumed.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.695
Sheriff...

09:03.276 --> 09:05.335
It's Hartley's group.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.105
Damn.

09:07.914 --> 09:11.281
I told my people to keep quiet
so this wouldn't happen.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.751
Looks like you might have
a few believers on the payroll.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.948
On behalf of the Miracle Ministry,

09:18.024 --> 09:20.549
we demand that you stop this sacrilege!

09:20.626 --> 09:24.585
You're notjust dealing with me, Vance.
You're dealing with the FBI.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.730
We don't mean you any disrespect.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.294
We're investigating a possible homicide

09:33.372 --> 09:37.240
and federal law requires
that we do a postmortem on these bodies.

09:37.343 --> 09:41.541
I'm afraid we answer to an even
higher authority than the US Government.

09:41.614 --> 09:46.415
One that considers gravedigging
and defiling corpses mortal sins.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.611
We'll get that autopsy.

09:48.721 --> 09:52.384
- Sooner or later, you know we will.
- The deceased's family

09:52.525 --> 09:54.857
does not want her grave disturbed.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.555
Carol Wallace had no family!

09:57.630 --> 09:59.655
We were her family.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.363
We... were her family.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.235
And it was hard enough to bury her once.

10:07.340 --> 10:13.006
So if you insist on going through with this,
we are prepared to maintain a vigil

10:13.079 --> 10:15.377
and do whatever it takes

10:15.448 --> 10:16.972
to stop you!

10:17.049 --> 10:18.778
Mulder.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.341
Scully.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.986
One of my men just spotted
the boy's car downtown.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.958
- We can't do much here anyway.
- Let's go.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.978
Not a very likely place to be saving souls.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.260
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the can.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.795
- What happened?
- That damn fool started a fight.

11:14.874 --> 11:19.277
Figures them Bible-thumpers
wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.744
Where you been, Samuel?
We've been looking for you.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.340
Yeah?

11:26.452 --> 11:28.113
I've been thinking.

11:28.921 --> 11:33.358
Well, you're gonna have plenty of time
for that in my cell. You're under arrest.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.724
- For murder?
- For suspicion of murder.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.497
Mind if I finish my beer first?

11:41.567 --> 11:44.502
No, you go right on ahead.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.970
I'll have somebody take your statement.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.474
I'll see what I can do about
getting your Caddy towed.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.776
Sheriff? What evidence do you have
to charge the boy with murder?

11:56.849 --> 12:00.182
What more do you want?
He's practically giving himself up.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.345
Look at him, though. He's drunk.

12:02.455 --> 12:06.858
Well, then I'll add drunk and disorderly.
Let's get this straight.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.724
It's not a question about the boy's guilt,

12:09.795 --> 12:11.888
just how he did it.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.989
Let me have a minute with him?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.398
Suit yourself.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.596
Samuel?
I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.540
From the FBI.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.342
Looks like you took quite a beating there.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.743
Penance, Mr Mulder.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.543
Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.141
You know what they say...

12:33.219 --> 12:35.380
"He giveth and he taketh away."

12:37.990 --> 12:40.515
A man gets too proud,

12:40.593 --> 12:44.529
sometimes it does him good
to get the crap kicked out of him.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.395
- Saves God the trouble.
- The trouble of what?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.900
Humbling the guilty sinner.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.596
Guilty of murder?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.972
Yes, sir.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.032
How'd you do it, Samuel?

12:59.311 --> 13:03.145
Apparently, my pride and weakness
were an invitation to the devil.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.445
I muddied the river of my own faith.

13:06.185 --> 13:11.384
- Now my gift has been corrupted.
- So you killed those people with a touch?

13:11.457 --> 13:14.790
I've laid my hands on the ill,
given them health.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.653
I've healed the sick.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.925
I've even touched the dying
and given them life.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.795
God has given me a special gift.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.168
Did he buy you all thatjewelry, too?

13:27.239 --> 13:30.231
There's something missing
in your story, Samuel.

13:30.342 --> 13:36.474
- Do you doubt the power of God, ma'am?
- No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.847
I have looked on the infirm
and seen their sickness,

13:39.952 --> 13:41.579
their cancer.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.824
Just as I can see the pain on this man

13:46.892 --> 13:49.053
right here.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.595
Really? What pain is that?

13:56.368 --> 13:59.997
The pain you have... regarding a brother

14:00.105 --> 14:04.235
or a sister. It's an old pain.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.579
- It's never been healed.
- Is this a trick?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.379
No trick, ma'am.

14:14.220 --> 14:18.657
- I think we should get the sheriff.
- I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.887
I can see it, plain as day.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.896
It was a sister. You lost a sister quite young.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.400
- Someone took her away.
- What else do you see?

14:30.469 --> 14:33.529
Strangers. A bright light.

14:33.639 --> 14:34.799
Sheriff?

14:34.907 --> 14:38.934
You should have come here earlier.
I could have healed your pain.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.512
- Let's get this over with.
- Another minute.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.673
I can't help you. Not any more.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.877
- My gift is gone.
- Cuff him.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.959
All right, let's go.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.754
You have the right to remain silent...

14:59.899 --> 15:02.766
I'll tell you, Mr Mulder...

15:03.903 --> 15:07.430
God watches over his flock.
He gives us signs every day.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.565
Open your heart.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.170
He mightjust open your eyes.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.251
How do you think he does it?

15:20.319 --> 15:21.980
I don't know.

15:29.094 --> 15:33.554
Given his exemplary record
and the circumstantial nature of this case,

15:34.667 --> 15:37.500
I ask that my client be released
on his own recognizance,

15:37.569 --> 15:38.593
without bail...

15:38.704 --> 15:40.865
Judge, that is not a good idea!

15:40.973 --> 15:44.409
- Samuel!
- Let me go and it'll be on your head!

15:44.510 --> 15:49.504
Enough! This is not a pulpit,
this is a court of law. Is that understood?

15:52.584 --> 15:54.211
Yes, sir.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.315
Sorry.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.086
Your Honor,

15:59.158 --> 16:03.686
despite the defendant's avowed guilt,
we see no reason to burden the county

16:03.762 --> 16:08.699
with his maintenance until trial. But
we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.759
All right. If there are no objections,

16:11.837 --> 16:13.930
bail is set at $100,000...

16:15.174 --> 16:18.610
to be deposited directly
into the clerk's probation account.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.913
My God! What is it?

16:23.449 --> 16:25.144
My God!

16:25.217 --> 16:27.310
My God! What is it? What is it?

16:39.264 --> 16:41.562
How much more will it take
for you to believe?

16:42.368 --> 16:44.962
The Lord has testified against me!

16:45.070 --> 16:49.166
Does a serpent have to bite you all on the ass
till you understand?!

16:49.241 --> 16:51.471
Everybody! Clear this courtroom!

17:10.429 --> 17:14.455
"And when it was morning,
the east wind brought the locusts."

17:14.566 --> 17:17.967
"And the locusts covered
the face of the whole earth,

17:18.069 --> 17:21.869
so that the land was darkened,
and they did eat every herb of the land...

17:21.973 --> 17:24.636
- Why, Mulder?
- And all the fruit of the trees..."

17:24.710 --> 17:28.510
A few thousand grasshoppers
does not constitute a plague.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.916
Besides which, we're in farm country.

17:32.017 --> 17:36.113
This area is an agricultural smorgasbord
for this type of infestation.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.180
Yeah, maybe in a cornfield,
but this happened in a courtroom.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.090
So what's next? Slaying of the first-born?

17:44.997 --> 17:48.694
Mulder, does this have something
to do with what Samuel said in the bar?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.860
About your sister?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.636
I had these patient cases sent over
from Kenwood County Hospital.

17:56.708 --> 18:02.271
These are cases of patients who went to
Samuel after conventional treatments failed.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.407
"Spontaneous remission
of metastatic cancer."

18:06.452 --> 18:09.546
"Regenerated nerve growth after paraplegia."

18:09.655 --> 18:13.887
I've encountered dozens of psychic healers
in the X-Files, but none like this.

18:13.959 --> 18:17.360
- I think the kid's for real.
- Mulder, this is intriguing,

18:17.463 --> 18:21.627
but there's a whole library of
medical literature dealing with

18:21.700 --> 18:24.134
unexplained spontaneous cures.

18:24.236 --> 18:29.230
Now, Western medicine treats
the human body in biochemical terms, right?

18:30.442 --> 18:33.775
But the body can also be treated
as an electromagnetic system.

18:33.879 --> 18:37.645
So you think if Samuel can repair
this energy field in order to heal,

18:37.716 --> 18:39.843
he can also destroy it in order to kill?

18:39.918 --> 18:40.976
Why not?

18:41.086 --> 18:45.523
OK. Say that Samuel's touch can kill.
Why would he want to?

18:45.591 --> 18:49.357
Well, you heard him - he muddied the river
of his own faith. That means he's...

18:56.468 --> 18:58.561
If you're available,

18:58.670 --> 19:01.070
the reverend would like to see you.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.945
I've been under a lot of stress lately,

19:07.012 --> 19:10.379
which I know doesn't excuse
my rude behavior yesterday,

19:10.482 --> 19:13.747
but I hope... somehow you find it
in your hearts to forgive me.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.810
Why did you want to speak with us?

19:17.589 --> 19:18.920
I need your help.

19:19.424 --> 19:22.359
Samuel's being tried for murder.
What you need is a good lawyer.

19:22.427 --> 19:25.487
- Samuel is innocent.
- How can you be sure of that?

19:26.365 --> 19:28.424
Because he's my son.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.162
I don't think that argument
will work on ajury.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.771
Samuel's confession won't help much either.

19:33.839 --> 19:38.503
You have to understand.
Samuel is a very complicated young man.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.774
He feels things... like no one else.

19:42.781 --> 19:46.046
To him a pinprick becomes a gaping wound.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.814
His power... comes from this ability to feel.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.189
But, you see, some people fear that power.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.419
And out of their weakness and their fear,
they seek to destroy it.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.052
You mean Sheriff Daniels.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.765
It's no secret that Sheriff Daniels
has tried to shut me down

20:01.833 --> 20:04.427
since I first opened the tent ten years ago.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.937
Well, he thinks that your ministry is a fraud.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.133
He's a faithless man, Agent Scully.

20:11.276 --> 20:14.439
His wife suffers from
a most painful arthritis,

20:14.546 --> 20:20.041
her fingers twisted like bitter roots,
yet he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.950
In light of recent events, you can't blame him.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.854
I don't know how those poor people died.

20:25.958 --> 20:31.055
I can't explain that, which is why
I'm asking you to be there tonight,

20:31.163 --> 20:34.894
so you could see for yourselves
Samuel doing God's work.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.294
Can I count on you both to be there?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.564
I think so. Mulder, what do you think?

20:40.639 --> 20:42.766
Excuse me.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.314
- Hey, where did she go?
- Who?

20:57.422 --> 21:00.983
- The little girl.
- There's no little girl around here.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.932
Mulder?

21:15.474 --> 21:18.068
- What is it?
- It's a girl.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.236
Who, Jessica Hahn?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.672
A little girl.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.018
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.222
Well, brothers and sisters, help yourselves.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.291
Let the folks with the wheelchairs through.
That's right, don't be shy.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.529
Hello, there. Welcome to the Miracle Ministry.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.664
- Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?
- Yes.

21:49.741 --> 21:53.837
- Is he going to be here? The papers said...
- Oh, don't mind the papers!

21:53.912 --> 21:56.278
God's work will be done.

21:56.381 --> 21:59.908
Young Samuel's here
to cast out the devil and heal the sick.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.749
- Did you hear that, honey?
- Will he be able to see me?

22:02.854 --> 22:07.154
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna put in a special word, hm?

22:07.259 --> 22:09.386
- What's your name?
- Margaret Hohman.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.394
Margaret, you wait right here.

22:11.496 --> 22:16.160
I'm gonna see if I can't get somebody
to put you in the front row. How'd that be?

22:20.672 --> 22:22.731
I can't go out there.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.742
Not after what's happened.

22:25.610 --> 22:30.775
God tests the faith in us all, son. And because
he's chosen you to act in his likeness,

22:30.882 --> 22:33.578
he's given you the toughest test of all.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.218
Do not forsake your gift, Samuel.

22:37.322 --> 22:38.983
Oh, man!

22:41.393 --> 22:43.759
I'm a preacher, son. That's my gift.

22:45.130 --> 22:50.158
But all the preaching in the world
could never equal even a small miracle

22:50.235 --> 22:53.830
in consolidating
the faith and hope of these people.

22:55.006 --> 22:58.533
Let this man, whose life you saved,

22:58.610 --> 23:00.908
give witness tonight

23:00.979 --> 23:04.210
to the grace and goodness
of your healing power.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.417
They're all waiting on you, Samuel.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.635
Here we go!

23:33.745 --> 23:36.646
Here he is! Get ready for the Reverend

23:36.748 --> 23:38.807
Calvin Hartley!

23:41.153 --> 23:44.020
Yes, indeedy! Praise God!

23:44.623 --> 23:45.647
Hallelujah!

23:45.757 --> 23:47.190
Hallelujah!

23:47.259 --> 23:48.658
Praise the Lord!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.159
Praise the Lord!

23:51.997 --> 23:54.431
- Amen! Tell it, brother!
- I'm ready!

23:54.566 --> 23:56.466
God is here tonight. Oh, yes!

23:56.601 --> 23:58.660
Pass it down, please.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.898
I feel his presence! Oh, amen!

24:02.007 --> 24:05.204
- Apparently miracles don't come cheap.
- God is here,

24:05.277 --> 24:08.075
and he is here

24:09.114 --> 24:10.240
to heal!

24:12.083 --> 24:14.074
Yes, heal!

24:14.186 --> 24:17.212
Hallelujah! There's a man

24:17.289 --> 24:20.122
I'd like to introduce to you. A man

24:20.225 --> 24:22.386
who has seen the face of God,

24:23.428 --> 24:26.920
but who was not satisfied
to go to that great place. Oh, no.

24:27.032 --> 24:30.058
No, God had work for him
to do right here on earth.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.228
As it is in heaven!

24:34.105 --> 24:36.266
I saw this man come back

24:36.341 --> 24:38.935
- from beyond death's door!
- Praise his name!

24:39.044 --> 24:42.013
He stands here today as a living testament

24:43.415 --> 24:46.111
to the ability of God

24:46.218 --> 24:49.654
to work miracles. Ladies and gentlemen,

24:49.721 --> 24:51.814
brothers and sisters,

24:52.691 --> 24:54.955
our beloved friend

24:55.060 --> 24:56.721
Leonard Vance.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.265
As it says in John, chapter three,

25:03.702 --> 25:06.865
no man can do these miracles
unless God be with him.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.067
That man to whom I owe my life

25:12.143 --> 25:13.872
is Samuel Hartley.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.138
And he is here tonight to heal you.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.081
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,

25:19.150 --> 25:21.880
God's soldier - Samuel Hartley.

25:29.327 --> 25:30.351
Mulder?

25:36.935 --> 25:38.402
Receive God's love.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.299
Feel the power of God.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.283
Pray with me.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.297
Close your eyes.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.150
- What have you done?
- OK, everyone, remain calm.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.448
Give the young woman room here.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.112
Praise God!

26:31.189 --> 26:33.316
Somebody get an ambulance!

26:33.391 --> 26:36.019
It's all right. Don't panic!

26:46.938 --> 26:48.565
She's dead.

27:09.094 --> 27:12.257
Beloved friends, children of God,

27:14.299 --> 27:16.392
brothers and sisters,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.428
if you desecrate the body,

27:19.971 --> 27:22.098
then you slay

27:22.207 --> 27:23.868
the soul!

27:26.277 --> 27:29.007
Let's keep this poor woman's body intact.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.377
We know that Reverend Hartley's
been pressuring you,

27:35.453 --> 27:39.446
but this is the third death
linked with the Miracle Ministry.

27:39.524 --> 27:43.483
Reverend Hartley says
an autopsy is against scripture.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.689
What illness did your daughter
suffer from, Mr Hohman?

27:46.831 --> 27:48.992
She had MS.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.501
Has she ever had a seizure before this?

27:51.603 --> 27:53.537
Not to my knowledge.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.697
You see, I think

27:55.840 --> 28:00.834
that the seizure she had is indicative
of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.472
The boy only touched her forehead.

28:03.548 --> 28:05.641
And are you going to be content

28:05.717 --> 28:08.413
to bury her

28:08.486 --> 28:11.284
without knowing the true cause of death?

28:11.356 --> 28:14.416
Without knowing
if there was foul play involved?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.455
Give me a moment.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.567
You think the boy really did it?

28:33.478 --> 28:34.502
No.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.274
Why not?

28:36.347 --> 28:38.713
I was raised a Catholic.

28:38.783 --> 28:42.378
I have a certain familiarity with the scripture.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.557
And God never lets the devil steal the show.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.751
You must have liked The Exorcist.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.192
One of my favorite movies.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.929
So, who were you pursuing
in the crowd tonight?

29:01.139 --> 29:03.198
I thought I saw someone I knew.

29:03.308 --> 29:06.072
The boy really has you going, doesn't he?

29:06.144 --> 29:08.305
Why do you say that?

29:08.379 --> 29:10.745
In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister.

29:10.815 --> 29:13.750
Is it your sister you keep
thinking you're seeing?

29:14.986 --> 29:17.079
I've seen her twice now.

29:17.155 --> 29:21.216
- Maybe you just want to see her.
- I'm not delusional, Scully.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.624
Don't discount the power of suggestion.

29:23.728 --> 29:28.427
A healer's greatest magic lies in
the patient's willingness to believe.

29:28.533 --> 29:32.799
Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there.
We learned that in med school.

29:32.904 --> 29:37.500
You think this is what Margaret Hohman
and her parents were imagining?

29:43.748 --> 29:46.615
We're going to go along
with your investigation.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.825
It's 11.21pm, March 7th.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.424
Subject's name is Margaret Hohman.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.868
Female, Caucasian,

30:07.005 --> 30:09.064
107 pounds.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.615
- Mulder, take a look at this.
- Do I have to?

30:18.683 --> 30:22.676
Lesions on the lungs. I'm finding them
throughout the cardiovascular

30:22.787 --> 30:26.052
and pulmonary systems.
There's also a lot of damage

30:26.157 --> 30:31.857
to the mucus membranes. I think that
she must have died from cellular hypoxia.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.056
A lack of oxygen to the cells.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.224
- What would cause that?
- My guess,

30:36.301 --> 30:39.828
ingestion or injection
of sodium or potassium cyanide.

30:39.904 --> 30:43.499
Maybe arsenic. I won't know exactly
until I run a toxicology screen.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.168
- How soon?
- Labs won't be open till morning.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.838
See who you can push to do it.
As soon as possible.

31:04.929 --> 31:07.056
Samuel? It's Agent Mulder.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.093
Yeah? What do you want?

31:11.202 --> 31:14.797
I want to talk with you.
If you'd prefer your attorney were present...

31:14.873 --> 31:17.273
Whatever. No.

31:17.342 --> 31:21.142
I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels.
He's on his way down here.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.441
I'm going to ask him to release you.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.278
Why are you doing this?

31:26.351 --> 31:29.343
You were there, man. You saw for yourself.

31:30.421 --> 31:32.855
Did you poison Margaret Hohman?

31:32.924 --> 31:34.619
Did I poison her?

31:34.692 --> 31:39.720
Did you poison her using potassium or
sodium cyanide? That's what killed her.

31:40.665 --> 31:44.328
- What are you talking about?
- You're innocent, Samuel.

31:44.435 --> 31:47.962
Unless you had a hand in administering it,
and I don't think you did.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.906
- Whatever the cause, I am responsible!
- The evidence will be

31:51.976 --> 31:56.140
presented tomorrow. Habeas corpus
law will force them to release you.

31:56.247 --> 31:59.876
- You might as well go home and rest.
- Just leave me alone, OK?

31:59.951 --> 32:04.320
If you think that the punishment for your sins
is the deaths of those people...

32:04.389 --> 32:06.949
The Lord has testified against me, Mr Mulder!

32:07.058 --> 32:14.521
I can't argue with your biblical rhetoric, but
I do know that the law will find you innocent!

32:19.938 --> 32:21.997
You said you could see my pain.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.331
Look at me.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.541
What do you see now?

32:31.516 --> 32:33.575
I see nothing.

32:34.585 --> 32:36.280
I'm blind.

32:37.221 --> 32:40.588
I don't believe you. I've seen her.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.993
- It was her, wasn't it?
- Your sister?

32:45.096 --> 32:47.223
You made her appear to me, didn't you?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.632
- Look at me!
- I am very tired, Mr Mulder.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.931
Is she alive?!

32:54.005 --> 32:56.838
Is that what I'm meant to believe
or is this a trick?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.805
You mean

33:02.814 --> 33:04.042
a trick of the devil?

33:06.584 --> 33:08.245
Jailer!

33:25.570 --> 33:29.973
- I see I'm a little late for this ball.
- I called you down here to release the boy.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.271
- On what pretense?
- His innocence.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.868
Aren't you a little out of your depth here?

33:34.979 --> 33:38.938
This may be hicksville to you,
but we do try and hew to the legal system.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.884
I don't want a fight.
He's determined to stay anyway.

33:41.986 --> 33:46.150
- What does that tell you?
- It tells me you're determined to charge him

33:46.257 --> 33:49.954
while your real homicide suspect
is still at large.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.579
Got some company for you, Sam.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.085
What are you looking at?

34:46.851 --> 34:49.012
I'll get it. I'll get it.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.354
Ma'am. Sheriff.

34:58.463 --> 34:59.691
Hey, Dennis.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.562
- How are you?
- Just fine, ma'am. Just fine.

35:03.501 --> 35:07.130
- Except we had an incident at the jail.
- What incident, Tyson?

35:08.506 --> 35:11.634
The preacher boy... He's dead.

35:20.485 --> 35:24.319
He was alone when Mulder left him
this morning. How could this happen?

35:24.455 --> 35:29.051
The boy started a fight with
a couple of rowdies we picked up on a DUI.

35:29.127 --> 35:34.064
Took some pretty mean blows to the head.
Died before the ambulance got here.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.927
- His blood is spilled and it's all over you!
- Reverend...

35:44.175 --> 35:47.906
How long will you hide behind that badge
before the truth is revealed?

35:47.979 --> 35:50.743
I have work to do.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.908
Reverend Hartley...

35:54.952 --> 35:57.011
We're sorry for your loss.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.612
That boy...

35:59.724 --> 36:01.919
He was blessed.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.086
He never hurt a soul.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.596
Our friends will know about Samuel

36:06.697 --> 36:10.758
sooner than later. And it's probably
best if they hear it from you.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.132
Come on.

36:12.203 --> 36:14.137
Ma'am.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.568
You've got that look on your face.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.506
What look is that?

36:23.581 --> 36:28.951
The kind when you've forgotten your keys
and you're trying to figure out what to do.

36:35.259 --> 36:37.557
What exactly are we trying to find?

36:38.529 --> 36:40.156
Clues?

36:40.231 --> 36:41.926
Oh.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.174
What does that mean?

37:02.386 --> 37:04.479
Let's find out.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.229
Scully!

37:19.303 --> 37:21.396
It's potato.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.033
Someone left a trail of food

37:25.109 --> 37:28.272
in the ventilation system
leading to the courtroom.

37:28.379 --> 37:30.370
You dump your locusts in here...

37:30.448 --> 37:33.679
- Instant plague.
- Where did they all come from?

37:33.784 --> 37:39.051
Biological supply houses usually hatch them
on order to farms and universities.

37:39.123 --> 37:42.024
It shouldn't be too hard
to find out who set this up.

37:42.093 --> 37:46.029
And you think whoever did this
is responsible for the murders?

38:16.294 --> 38:17.955
You're dead.

38:18.062 --> 38:20.121
They killed you.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.831
I was dead.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.960
- But here I am.
- No!

38:26.070 --> 38:27.833
Why did you betray me?

38:32.376 --> 38:34.469
You murdered those people.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.740
They came to me to be healed

38:39.383 --> 38:41.851
and you murdered them.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.546
Why?

38:44.288 --> 38:46.552
After I gave you back your life.

38:46.691 --> 38:48.784
You call this life?!

38:56.500 --> 38:58.525
What in tarnation do you want?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.763
We're here to arrest Leonard Vance.
Where is he?

39:01.872 --> 39:04.898
- You must be mistaken.
- I'm afraid not.

39:04.975 --> 39:08.706
We traced a pesticide order to him
from a company in Knoxville.

39:08.779 --> 39:11.373
Cyanogen bromide - it's a cyanide derivative.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.541
Leonard poisoned those people.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.889
Get your clothes on, Vance.
You're under arrest.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.226
I betrayed him.

39:29.133 --> 39:33.536
Cyanide. There's no way to tell
how much he's ingested.

39:33.604 --> 39:34.730
I'll call an ambulance.

39:34.805 --> 39:37.501
- No, we have to take him ourselves.
- I thought

39:37.575 --> 39:39.702
"Why didn't he let me die?"

39:40.945 --> 39:45.006
Beware of false prophets
who come to you in sheep's clothing,

39:45.116 --> 39:47.175
but inwardly are...

39:47.251 --> 39:49.151
are ravening wolves!

39:49.220 --> 39:51.245
That's what I thought he was,

39:51.355 --> 39:54.347
because who else would bring me back

39:54.425 --> 39:56.450
looking like this!

39:57.628 --> 39:58.856
He was here.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.431
- Who?
- Samuel.

40:01.532 --> 40:04.399
- The man's delirious.
- He was here, reverend.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.561
Right in this room.

40:08.272 --> 40:10.365
And he forgave me.

40:20.951 --> 40:26.651
Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance
contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.989
We have evidence connecting him
both to the courtroom infestation

40:31.061 --> 40:34.622
and to the poisoning deaths
of three members of the ministry.

40:35.866 --> 40:38.994
Vance's obsession outlived Samuel, however.

40:39.069 --> 40:44.200
His conscience haunted him until he became
delusory and fiinally took his own life,

40:44.275 --> 40:47.676
effectively ending our investigation.

40:47.812 --> 40:52.181
In light of this information, it is highly
doubtful that there have ever been

40:52.249 --> 40:54.479
any miracles in Kenwood, Tennessee.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.782
Mulder.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.591
Scully?

41:11.101 --> 41:15.470
Sheriff Daniels just called.
Samuel's body's missing from the morgue.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.034
Any witnesses?

41:21.111 --> 41:25.104
One so far. The night nurse
who made the report - Beatrice Salinger.

41:26.851 --> 41:29.877
- She saw somebody take the body?
- Not actually.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.252
- What do you mean?
- Talk sense, deputy.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.724
She didn't exactly see anyone
taking the body.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.919
- Well, what then?
- She...

41:38.963 --> 41:41.955
She claims she saw Samuel
walking out by himself.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.330
Sounds crazy, I know, but

41:44.435 --> 41:46.494
that's what she told me.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.297
You coming, sheriff?

41:53.911 --> 41:55.936
I was drinking my coffee

41:56.046 --> 41:59.709
and going over the night orders
for my ward, 7 South,

41:59.783 --> 42:01.910
when he walked right by me.

42:01.986 --> 42:04.113
His face was all black and blue.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.655
And you're sure it was him?

42:05.723 --> 42:10.956
At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks,
which happens a lot on graveyard.

42:11.929 --> 42:15.490
So I got up to look again,
but I lost him round a corner.

42:15.566 --> 42:19.764
He just vanished.
Then I went to check the morgue

42:19.904 --> 42:21.963
and his body was gone.

42:22.072 --> 42:27.305
I don't believe this. This is insane.
I'm not listening to this woman's crazy talk.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.576
I'm not the only one who saw him, sheriff!
So I know I'm not crazy.

42:31.682 --> 42:33.616
Other people saw him, too.

42:38.355 --> 42:40.220
I'm not crazy.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.351
It was Samuel.

43:09.053 --> 43:11.783
This isn't true, Maurice,

43:11.855 --> 43:12.947
is it?

43:13.857 --> 43:17.224
The boy was an awful fake,
just like you said, wasn't he, Maurice?

43:22.132 --> 43:24.191
Wasn't he, Maurice?

43:40.417 --> 43:42.851
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you

43:42.987 --> 43:44.614
to come with me.

43:44.688 --> 43:49.819
District attorney wants to ask you
some questions concerning the boy's death.

43:55.399 --> 43:58.766
Sundays will probably
never be the same again in these parts.

43:58.836 --> 44:02.829
I have a strong sense the reverend
won't be able to give up the pulpit.

44:02.906 --> 44:07.104
- Even without his son?
- It might even strengthen his faith.

44:07.211 --> 44:09.270
The boy did rise from the dead.

44:09.380 --> 44:13.248
That kind of thing happens only
once or twice every two thousand years.

44:13.317 --> 44:16.844
Yeah, and I have a story
about a plague of locusts.

44:16.920 --> 44:21.857
I hope Reverend Hartley didn't arrange this
body snatching as his miracle of miracles.

44:21.925 --> 44:25.520
- Somehow I don't think so.
- What exactly do you think?

44:25.629 --> 44:28.291
I think people are looking hard for miracles,

44:28.399 --> 44:32.733
so hard that maybe they make themselves
see what they want to see.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.876
Are you coming, Mulder?
