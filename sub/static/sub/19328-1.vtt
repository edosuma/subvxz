01:00.625 --> 01:02.450
Over here.

01:10.225 --> 01:11.669
Babe?

01:29.785 --> 01:31.310
Jason?

01:36.970 --> 01:38.491
Jason?

02:07.405 --> 02:09.125
Help me!

02:09.205 --> 02:12.445
Help me! Open the door! Help me!

02:12.525 --> 02:15.014
Help me! Help!

02:18.065 --> 02:19.627
Hello!

02:28.915 --> 02:31.215
Come on, come on, come on!

02:35.515 --> 02:37.304
Oh, my God.

03:16.775 --> 03:19.476
Look, I've been trying
to reach her for a couple of days...

03:19.556 --> 03:22.775
...so if she contacts you,
can you have her give me a call?

03:23.755 --> 03:25.561
Alright, thanks.

03:43.895 --> 03:46.635
- Jackie.
- Tim, yeah.

03:46.715 --> 03:49.275
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind... I need your help.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.915
- <i>What is it?</i>
- My friend, Danielle.

03:51.995 --> 03:54.515
I haven't been able to reach her for weeks.

03:54.595 --> 03:57.435
<i>I've called everyone she knows
and no one has heard from her.</i>

03:57.515 --> 04:00.064
Is she missing or not wanting to be found?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.116
I don't know.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.355
I'm just really worried.

04:05.435 --> 04:07.855
Alright, I'll, uh... I'll look into it.

04:07.935 --> 04:11.147
Thanks. Her name is Danielle Hampton.

04:15.435 --> 04:17.396
And just answer as best you can, okay?

04:17.485 --> 04:20.015
Honestly. There's a pen.

04:20.095 --> 04:22.127
And you can go in that room.

04:23.895 --> 04:25.403
Okay.

04:35.595 --> 04:37.645
Sign right there at the bottom.

04:40.275 --> 04:41.748
Good luck.

04:41.828 --> 04:43.662
Thank you.

04:44.315 --> 04:47.115
Congratulations. Big day today?

04:47.195 --> 04:49.750
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'll walk you out.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.175
Any word from Danielle?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.476
- No, nothing.
- Huh.

04:59.755 --> 05:02.555
- She'll turn up.
- I hope so.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.856
Ah. Here you go.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.395
Oh! I almost forgot. You'll need these.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.996
Hmm.

05:10.775 --> 05:12.701
I'm really proud of you, Jackie.

05:12.781 --> 05:15.995
- Thank you.
- Clean slate, fresh start.

05:16.075 --> 05:18.785
The rest is up to you.

05:18.865 --> 05:20.670
Come here.

05:22.595 --> 05:24.435
Good luck.

05:28.154 --> 05:30.555
I'll see you at the meeting this week?

05:30.635 --> 05:32.534
Of course.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.318
Danielle.

08:50.955 --> 08:52.959
She wouldn't leave this behind.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.589
Great.

10:29.615 --> 10:31.458
Oh, yeah!

10:33.775 --> 10:35.195
Yeah! Yeah!

10:35.275 --> 10:37.295
Yeah! Oh!

10:39.395 --> 10:41.675
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.235
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:46.315 --> 10:48.775
Uh-huh. Oh, God. Yeah.

10:48.855 --> 10:52.339
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:24.255 --> 11:25.762
Hello?

11:26.975 --> 11:28.203
Hello?

12:20.355 --> 12:23.915
- I needed the cash.
- Prostitution is a crime.

12:23.995 --> 12:27.525
- You can't just evict me.
- It's all your own fault.

12:27.605 --> 12:30.935
So after five years, that's it?
No 30-day notice?

12:31.015 --> 12:35.135
- You know the rules.
- Fuck the rules! You are so full of shit.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.925
Oh, no need to make it personal, my dear.

12:39.555 --> 12:42.558
Fuck! Bitch needs to get laid.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.435
Oh, I must apologize for her behavior.

12:47.515 --> 12:51.393
Don't be frightened, Jacquelin.
I'm Eleanor Mudgett. Please come in.

13:00.395 --> 13:04.575
I have made it a custom,
old fashioned, though it may seem...

13:04.655 --> 13:07.675
...to meet every new tenant we take in.

13:09.675 --> 13:14.715
Many years ago, I had to figure out
what to do with this lovely old building.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.395
I am on the board
of many rehabilitation centers...

13:18.475 --> 13:21.135
...and outreach programs throughout the city.

13:21.215 --> 13:25.305
So I figured that I should use
Havenhurst to help others.

13:25.385 --> 13:28.785
Give them a place to find their balance...

13:28.865 --> 13:31.675
...and re-enter the world.

13:32.155 --> 13:34.475
Don't be shy, dear. You must have questions.

13:34.555 --> 13:36.081
Um...

13:37.020 --> 13:39.875
...my friend, Danielle Hampton...

13:39.955 --> 13:42.135
- ...she lived here.
- Yes.

13:42.215 --> 13:45.195
Is there a reason why I was
given her old apartment?

13:45.275 --> 13:48.615
Oh, it's just a matter of timing, dear.

13:48.695 --> 13:53.405
Danielle and Jason just happened
to be the last tenants to vacate.

13:54.635 --> 13:58.195
I was just hoping that you
might know where they went.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.295
No, I'm afraid not.

14:00.375 --> 14:04.386
One of the drawbacks
of not requiring a security deposit.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.715
Once they leave the building...

14:06.795 --> 14:08.796
...one rarely hears from them again.

14:11.295 --> 14:14.515
- Okay.
- Make no mistake about it.

14:14.595 --> 14:18.999
I am very particular about those
whom I choose as tenants.

14:20.875 --> 14:24.575
Your history, rather violent and sad...

14:24.655 --> 14:26.195
...stood out to me.

14:26.275 --> 14:29.615
You have struggled with your addiction...

14:29.695 --> 14:32.304
...and it has cost you dearly.

14:35.295 --> 14:38.135
Oh, my son, Ezra.

14:38.615 --> 14:40.315
We've met.

14:40.395 --> 14:43.435
Ezra looks after things around here
so if there's anything you need...

14:43.515 --> 14:45.096
...don't hesitate to call him.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.455
Thank you, Ezra.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.255
Our rules are simple.

14:56.335 --> 14:59.375
You stay sober, you lead a good life...

15:00.055 --> 15:03.535
...and you don't fall back
into your old habits.

15:04.315 --> 15:07.795
Then, you are welcome to stay here...

15:07.875 --> 15:09.715
...until the day you die.

15:10.395 --> 15:12.417
If that is your choice.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.295
And if I don't lead a good life?

15:16.375 --> 15:20.395
Then your stay at Havenhurst
would be terminated.

15:20.475 --> 15:23.515
- Like the woman...
- Oh, Paula, yes.

15:23.595 --> 15:27.155
Well, unfortunately,
after years of support...

15:27.235 --> 15:30.475
...she decided to resume demeaning herself...

15:30.555 --> 15:32.710
...and is no longer welcome here.

15:33.755 --> 15:35.962
Well, it seems fair enough.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.895
- Do you have a pen?
- Oh, you don't have to sign it...

15:39.975 --> 15:44.895
...right now, dear. You should
take it home and review it first.

15:44.975 --> 15:49.074
If what you say is represented
here, it's okay, I can sign it.

15:50.275 --> 15:52.097
Yes, it is.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.820
Welcome to Havenhurst.

16:21.515 --> 16:23.995
It's four sections. You're on the right.

16:25.075 --> 16:28.315
Welcome to hell, sweetie.
More cleavage, more tips.

16:28.395 --> 16:31.255
Tips suck. Food is even worse.
But it's a job.

16:31.335 --> 16:33.355
I think I can handle it.

16:33.435 --> 16:36.455
- It's only...
- Temporary. Yeah.

16:36.535 --> 16:39.192
Go on, doll. You got customers.

16:53.195 --> 16:55.079
I'll take a refill.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.695
Did you find anything out?

16:58.775 --> 17:01.255
No credit cards, no cell phone usage.

17:01.835 --> 17:04.855
She was living with a guy
named Jason Darby. A junkie.

17:04.935 --> 17:08.781
Busted for narcotics possession.
Do you know him?

17:09.315 --> 17:10.575
No.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.795
I spoke to Eleanor, the woman who owns
the place. Said they left weeks ago.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.315
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh.

17:17.395 --> 17:19.915
I thought you said you'd done this before.

17:21.075 --> 17:24.635
There's got to be something to this.
I found Danielle's camera.

17:24.714 --> 17:28.194
She was never without it in rehab. Never.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.355
She wouldn't have just left it behind.

17:30.435 --> 17:31.956
Well...

17:32.489 --> 17:34.177
...maybe this time she did.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.322
Stay in touch. Take care of yourself.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.616
Thank you.

18:23.715 --> 18:25.556
You're new.

18:27.155 --> 18:29.435
Yes, 206.

18:30.315 --> 18:33.106
Oh. That's Danielle's old apartment.

18:40.755 --> 18:43.551
- Let me help you.
- I'm good.

18:46.955 --> 18:49.640
Let me go first. Then you go after.

18:52.155 --> 18:54.115
I'm Sarah.

18:54.195 --> 18:55.273
Jackie.

19:12.135 --> 19:15.315
- Where the hell have you been?
- I lost track of the time.

19:15.395 --> 19:17.215
Sorry, Tammy.

19:18.955 --> 19:20.662
Problem?

19:23.315 --> 19:24.499
No.

19:42.275 --> 19:43.829
Hello?

19:48.215 --> 19:49.760
Hello?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.475
What the fuck?

22:28.282 --> 22:30.155
No, no!

22:30.535 --> 22:32.075
Please!

23:12.435 --> 23:14.000
Hello?

23:33.435 --> 23:34.989
Paula?

23:52.595 --> 23:54.037
Paula?

24:13.315 --> 24:14.875
Sarah.

24:15.355 --> 24:17.435
What are you doing in here?

24:17.515 --> 24:18.744
Nothing.

24:20.355 --> 24:23.011
You shouldn't be here. Come on.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.315
You know, you shouldn't be wandering
around the building alone.

24:32.395 --> 24:34.646
But I haven't done anything wrong.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.055
I wish it were that simple.

24:38.435 --> 24:42.495
It is. Just be good.

24:42.575 --> 24:44.460
You don't want to be evicted.

24:51.995 --> 24:53.854
Gotta go.

24:59.255 --> 25:01.292
You know you didn't. Just shut up!

25:03.375 --> 25:05.459
Come on, hurry up, get in the car.

25:06.975 --> 25:08.837
Come on, get in the car.

25:43.155 --> 25:47.714
And my hands were shaking as I put
my four-year-old baby girl into that car.

25:49.195 --> 25:51.045
If I had lost her...

25:51.895 --> 25:53.327
...I never would have made it.

26:00.995 --> 26:03.155
Thanks everyone for sharing today.

26:03.235 --> 26:06.515
- Remember, keep coming back.
- It works if you work it.

26:14.295 --> 26:17.975
Thanks for coming.
Can you look into Paula St. Claire?

26:18.055 --> 26:20.275
Jackie, another tenant?

26:20.355 --> 26:22.675
I heard a struggle and then I found this.

26:25.555 --> 26:29.635
- There's something odd about that place.
- So don't go back.

26:29.715 --> 26:31.755
I want to be there when
Danielle comes back for her stuff.

26:31.835 --> 26:35.255
- If she comes back.
- Look, if you don't want to help me...

26:35.335 --> 26:36.995
Is everything okay?

26:37.075 --> 26:38.755
Yes, of course.

26:38.835 --> 26:43.055
Oh. Mike, this is Tim. He's an old friend.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.675
- Good to meet you, Tim.
- Likewise.

26:44.755 --> 26:46.735
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

26:46.875 --> 26:50.915
- I'll call you later. You take care.
- You, too.

26:51.395 --> 26:53.455
You in some kind of trouble?

26:53.935 --> 26:57.525
- Why would you ask that?
- Well, I know a cop when I see one.

26:58.595 --> 27:01.755
You ever hear of anything strange
going on at Havenhurst?

27:01.835 --> 27:04.735
- Like what?
- Tenants going missing.

27:04.815 --> 27:07.235
Oh, other than Danielle?

27:08.115 --> 27:11.975
I've put a good number of patients
in that place. They all seem to love it.

27:12.055 --> 27:14.075
Jackie, what's going on?

27:14.155 --> 27:15.584
I'm not sure yet.

28:17.815 --> 28:20.551
- You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry.

28:20.895 --> 28:22.935
How did you get in here?

28:24.215 --> 28:26.095
- Ezra.
- Did he give that to you...

28:26.175 --> 28:29.576
- ...or did you take it?
- No. He's my friend.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.809
Alright, well...

28:36.375 --> 28:39.576
Look, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on in.

28:57.075 --> 28:59.940
- What's that?
- I'm not sure.

29:04.635 --> 29:07.127
- What do you have behind your back?
- Nothing.

29:07.207 --> 29:09.609
Come on, show me what it is. I won't get mad.

29:19.075 --> 29:22.315
Sarah, you can't just steal
from people's homes.

29:22.395 --> 29:25.275
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you do something like this?

29:25.355 --> 29:28.434
I wanted something so I would remember you.

29:28.514 --> 29:30.395
Remember me?

29:30.675 --> 29:32.515
I just got here.

29:35.395 --> 29:37.635
Did you know Danielle very well?

29:37.715 --> 29:40.809
She was nice. She took that picture.

29:42.139 --> 29:43.755
Yeah.

29:43.835 --> 29:45.315
She did that a lot.

29:45.855 --> 29:47.775
I have something of hers.

29:47.855 --> 29:50.897
One of her cameras. I can show you.

29:52.235 --> 29:53.629
Okay.

29:57.075 --> 29:59.815
Tammy's sleeping. She works nights.

29:59.895 --> 30:02.230
Why do you call her Tammy?
Isn't she your mother?

30:02.310 --> 30:04.195
No.

30:04.475 --> 30:08.254
Foster mom. I don't know
anything about my real parents.

30:13.295 --> 30:15.512
In here. It's my secret spot.

30:41.895 --> 30:45.075
You can keep it.
I don't know how to work it anyway.

30:45.155 --> 30:48.295
- Thanks.
- Sarah, what's going on?

30:48.375 --> 30:50.115
Sorry, Tammy.

30:50.195 --> 30:53.075
Jackie lives down the hall.
I invited her over.

30:53.155 --> 30:56.815
- Sorry if we woke you up.
- You didn't. I have to get dinner on.

30:56.895 --> 30:58.875
Did you finish your homework?

30:58.955 --> 31:01.179
Am I making an extra plate?

31:03.435 --> 31:06.514
No. Thank you, I better get going.

31:14.755 --> 31:17.612
- Thanks for this.
- Well, hello.

31:22.475 --> 31:24.300
You okay?

31:25.935 --> 31:27.655
She's fine.

31:27.735 --> 31:30.996
- Oh.
- She's good.

31:34.115 --> 31:35.693
Don't be a stranger.

31:45.575 --> 31:49.195
Goddammit. Why can't you
control yourself? You ruin everything!

31:49.275 --> 31:52.575
- You don't like the way I do things?
- No, I don't like the way you do things.

31:52.655 --> 31:56.469
Then, go! Leave home! Go! Get out!

32:00.215 --> 32:01.752
Ah.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.674
I'm going to take a shower.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.354
Oh, God.

32:16.995 --> 32:21.217
I left your dinner on the counter.
You'd do best to eat in your room tonight.

32:21.297 --> 32:22.995
Tammy.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.795
Just stay out of his way.

32:24.875 --> 32:26.765
Can't you stay home tonight?

32:26.845 --> 32:30.667
Stay in your room and you'll be fine. Okay?

32:58.255 --> 32:59.675
Sarah.

33:02.835 --> 33:04.389
Sarah?

33:09.875 --> 33:11.411
Sarah!

33:16.055 --> 33:18.319
You're not being very nice.

33:22.075 --> 33:25.022
What? You don't want to play?

33:26.675 --> 33:28.299
Hey!

34:29.514 --> 34:31.235
Motherfucker.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.831
You little bitch.

34:49.835 --> 34:51.395
Oh.

34:53.817 --> 34:55.337
Damn.

35:05.875 --> 35:09.391
- Yes, it's definitely Danielle's camera.
- <i>What's in the pictures?</i>

35:09.471 --> 35:12.235
They're being processed. I'll know soon.

35:12.315 --> 35:14.372
<i>I looked into Paula St. Claire.</i>

35:15.195 --> 35:17.891
- And?
- <i>Been a working girl for a long time.</i>

35:17.971 --> 35:20.315
<i>Rough childhood,
she's been through the system a lot.</i>

35:20.395 --> 35:22.781
She went back to her old ways,
just like Danielle.

35:22.861 --> 35:25.295
<i>No missing persons on her yet.</i>

35:26.394 --> 35:28.475
Yeah, something's off.

35:29.555 --> 35:33.018
I think Danielle knew.
That's why she was documenting it.

35:34.725 --> 35:37.210
They both broke the rules.

35:40.095 --> 35:43.635
- Maybe that's how I'll find her.
- <i>Jackie, what are you talking about?</i>

35:43.715 --> 35:46.435
Ma'am? They're ready.

35:46.515 --> 35:50.414
Listen, I'll call you when I have
a chance to go through the pictures.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.194
Wayne?

37:03.795 --> 37:05.646
What the hell?

37:07.575 --> 37:09.395
What's going on?

37:09.675 --> 37:11.773
He broke the rules.

37:15.355 --> 37:17.280
Where is he?

37:22.085 --> 37:23.605
What the fuck?

37:24.795 --> 37:26.374
Wayne?

37:32.555 --> 37:34.409
Holy shit.

37:42.475 --> 37:45.633
Sarah! Open it! Sarah!

37:45.713 --> 37:47.795
Sarah, open the door!

37:48.075 --> 37:49.639
What?

37:56.815 --> 37:58.365
Sarah!

37:58.695 --> 37:59.955
Sarah, open the door!

38:10.135 --> 38:12.266
Open it! Sarah!

38:12.346 --> 38:14.178
Sarah, open the door!

38:27.515 --> 38:29.155
Sarah.

38:42.065 --> 38:43.795
No.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.926
It's too late for them.

38:48.675 --> 38:50.271
Stay here.

40:10.535 --> 40:12.071
Tammy.

40:28.215 --> 40:29.751
We got evicted.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.255
Why?

40:33.335 --> 40:37.596
Because of Wayne.
Bad things happen when he drinks.

40:39.365 --> 40:41.210
Did he hurt you?

40:46.475 --> 40:48.315
Who are you calling?

40:48.395 --> 40:49.594
A friend.

41:02.637 --> 41:04.038
God.

42:07.195 --> 42:09.037
Oh, my God.

42:16.535 --> 42:18.192
Oh, Wayne.

42:20.975 --> 42:23.012
I can't understand...

43:33.315 --> 43:35.374
Please, feel free.

43:43.495 --> 43:46.577
What exactly is it that we're looking for?

43:50.995 --> 43:54.620
There was blood on the sheets.
The lamp was...

43:56.495 --> 43:58.338
You actually saw this?

44:01.665 --> 44:03.226
Yes.

44:03.595 --> 44:07.215
This place was a mess.
There was blood on the counter.

44:07.295 --> 44:10.781
Dear, are you feeling alright?

44:12.135 --> 44:14.075
Please accept my apology.

44:14.255 --> 44:17.401
Obviously there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

44:17.481 --> 44:19.716
No, no. Not necessary.

44:32.155 --> 44:34.839
Such a pretty little girl.

44:36.275 --> 44:38.341
I always wanted a daughter.

44:39.115 --> 44:43.555
You're more than welcome to stay with me,
dear, until your mother gets back.

44:43.635 --> 44:45.475
No, she's fine with me.

44:45.555 --> 44:47.515
Well, suit yourself.

44:47.595 --> 44:49.875
But our door is always open...

44:49.955 --> 44:51.983
...if you change your mind.

44:52.935 --> 44:56.376
- Again, sorry for the trouble.
- Oh, it's no trouble.

45:01.475 --> 45:04.513
I found this hidden in one
of Danielle's picture frames.

45:07.035 --> 45:08.880
And these pictures.

45:11.495 --> 45:13.435
Danielle was documenting the place.

45:13.515 --> 45:16.395
Now if you'll look close,
you can see a few key changes.

45:16.475 --> 45:18.895
Like here. Look.

45:20.075 --> 45:22.760
The hallway's smaller. And here...

45:24.715 --> 45:26.439
...the wall's been moved.

45:28.595 --> 45:31.255
And there's something
going on in the laundry room.

45:31.335 --> 45:34.495
- You were down there?
- Not yet, but look at the door.

45:34.575 --> 45:35.959
It's gone.

45:40.475 --> 45:42.501
These are measurements.

45:46.495 --> 45:48.554
It's roughly the size of this room.

45:51.935 --> 45:54.725
I need more time with this. Can I take these?

45:54.805 --> 45:57.330
Yeah. I had two sets made.

45:58.795 --> 46:00.755
What about the little girl?

46:00.835 --> 46:03.995
- I should call Child Services.
- No.

46:04.075 --> 46:07.075
- No, I can watch her for a bit.
- Jackie, it doesn't work like that.

46:09.060 --> 46:11.375
At least let her stay the night.

46:11.455 --> 46:13.391
In case her foster mom reappears.

46:16.795 --> 46:18.376
Fine.

47:26.355 --> 47:27.995
Here's to breaking the rules.

47:29.275 --> 47:31.208
I hope this leads me to you.

48:20.735 --> 48:22.595
Oh, Crawford.

48:22.675 --> 48:24.959
That missing persons you asked for.

48:31.195 --> 48:34.415
- She had a long list.
- You still looking at Havenhurst?

48:34.495 --> 48:36.975
- Not officially, no.
- I don't know a thing.

48:37.055 --> 48:38.922
Thanks, Hal.

49:13.365 --> 49:15.289
It's a four-foot difference.

49:19.615 --> 49:22.845
No! No!

49:22.925 --> 49:26.065
Let me go! My daughter! No!

49:41.415 --> 49:42.965
Oh.

49:43.515 --> 49:47.195
I'm sorry. I was trying to make breakfast.

49:48.275 --> 49:50.095
It's okay.

49:53.655 --> 49:56.515
- You don't look good.
- Oh, yeah.

49:57.105 --> 49:58.910
I'm fine.

50:07.495 --> 50:08.547
Oh.

50:15.555 --> 50:17.380
You okay?

50:19.355 --> 50:21.233
Yeah, I'm good.

50:32.695 --> 50:34.498
I miss this.

50:36.375 --> 50:38.179
Bad pancakes?

50:41.495 --> 50:42.671
Sure.

50:43.655 --> 50:45.245
Hey.

50:49.275 --> 50:53.443
- Do you know where the laundry room is?
- Yeah, of course. You need to do a load?

50:53.523 --> 50:57.935
Not yet. I was just wondering
if you could take me there.

50:58.335 --> 50:59.772
No prob.

51:02.175 --> 51:06.295
Oh. That is unfortunate.

51:07.275 --> 51:10.785
Well, we can't have that, now, can we?

51:11.655 --> 51:13.525
Run along.

51:27.635 --> 51:29.484
Too bad.

51:29.955 --> 51:34.426
And I had such high hopes for her.

51:44.455 --> 51:46.290
It's this way.

52:22.915 --> 52:26.375
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a way in.

52:26.455 --> 52:29.695
- To what?
- There used to be a door here.

52:30.315 --> 52:34.117
They must be hiding something important
if they went to all this trouble to cover it.

52:50.635 --> 52:52.695
I don't think you should do that.

54:56.955 --> 54:58.554
What is it?

54:58.635 --> 55:00.453
We should get out of here.

55:12.415 --> 55:13.935
Stay.

55:17.855 --> 55:19.391
Hello?

56:01.975 --> 56:03.514
Run!

56:28.575 --> 56:30.395
You okay?

56:38.135 --> 56:39.776
No.

56:43.095 --> 56:44.345
No.

56:44.425 --> 56:47.251
No, come on. No!

57:09.285 --> 57:12.152
Come on. Close.

57:13.635 --> 57:15.460
Come on, close.

58:06.175 --> 58:07.854
What's on your door?

58:43.075 --> 58:45.300
Stay here.

58:55.855 --> 58:58.595
- Detective Crawford.
- Tim, they have us trapped.

58:58.675 --> 59:01.555
- We're stuck on the 10th floor.
- Wait, slow down. What happened?

59:01.635 --> 59:04.679
I found a room in the basement.
It has all the proof you need.

59:06.405 --> 59:09.555
Danielle and the others, they were killed.

59:10.835 --> 59:13.885
- Killed?
- Have you ever heard of H.H. Holmes?

59:13.965 --> 59:16.599
<i>Holmes? The serial killer from Chicago?</i>

59:16.775 --> 59:18.315
Tim, listen.

59:18.395 --> 59:21.986
His real name was Herman Webster Mudgett.

59:24.455 --> 59:25.897
<i>Holmes was just an alias.</i>

59:31.435 --> 59:32.995
<i>Mudgett.</i>

59:33.075 --> 59:35.569
Eleanor Mudgett.

59:37.935 --> 59:40.030
Oh, it's you.

59:42.035 --> 59:45.224
The walls. That's why there's
so much space between the walls.

59:45.304 --> 59:47.255
<i>He must have started here first.</i>

59:47.335 --> 59:49.160
It's still happening.

59:50.155 --> 59:53.140
<i>The passageways, the disappearances.</i>

59:53.595 --> 59:57.169
It's alright, dear. You'll be perfectly safe.

01:00:00.015 --> 01:00:02.579
- Sarah?
- <i>Jackie?</i>

01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.195
Jackie, you there?

01:00:06.275 --> 01:00:07.800
Sarah.

01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:21.894
Sarah?

01:00:27.195 --> 01:00:30.075
- Where's Sarah?
- Oh, she's not here, Jacqueline.

01:00:30.155 --> 01:00:33.315
Don't fuck with me, Eleanor.
I know all about you.

01:00:33.395 --> 01:00:36.456
Calm down, dear. Let's be civilized.

01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:40.375
Just give her to me now
and we'll go, we'll leave here...

01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:42.755
...and you'll never see
or hear from us again.

01:00:42.835 --> 01:00:46.675
Look at yourself. A hopeless addict.

01:00:46.755 --> 01:00:48.735
A waster of life.

01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:51.056
You can't even take care of yourself.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.555
Pathetic.

01:00:53.635 --> 01:00:55.416
You're weak.

01:00:55.895 --> 01:00:57.699
You're sick.

01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:02.716
On the contrary.

01:01:03.195 --> 01:01:05.335
It is you addicts...

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:07.675
...prostitutes, pedophiles...

01:01:07.755 --> 01:01:10.355
...and your pathetic enablers
who are the sick ones.

01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:12.835
Parasites to everyone around you.

01:01:12.915 --> 01:01:17.275
Oh, the people you've hurt
with your... your selfishness.

01:01:17.355 --> 01:01:19.375
Your acts of self-destruction...

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:22.256
...the innocent lives you destroy.

01:01:23.035 --> 01:01:25.675
You don't know what it is...

01:01:25.755 --> 01:01:28.196
...to be a real mother.

01:01:28.775 --> 01:01:32.816
To live selflessly, to... to sacrifice.

01:01:34.755 --> 01:01:37.355
You failed your own child.

01:01:37.435 --> 01:01:39.915
And now she's rotting in a grave.

01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:41.880
Fuck you!

01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:46.735
Oh, darling. You've been evicted.

01:01:46.815 --> 01:01:49.566
Run along. You don't have much time.

01:01:50.495 --> 01:01:52.356
I'm not leaving without her.

01:01:53.035 --> 01:01:54.895
My dear...

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:57.079
...you're not leaving at all.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.315
- Jackie?
- Sarah?

01:07:26.395 --> 01:07:28.115
Sarah.

01:07:28.195 --> 01:07:30.795
- Are you hurt?
- No.

01:07:35.075 --> 01:07:36.938
He's not far.

01:07:40.315 --> 01:07:41.631
Hurry.

01:07:55.895 --> 01:07:57.714
He's coming.

01:08:04.775 --> 01:08:06.476
We'll run for it.

01:08:25.715 --> 01:08:28.243
Go! Go!

01:09:42.755 --> 01:09:44.161
Stop!

01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:47.055
Please.

01:10:04.195 --> 01:10:06.055
You hurt him.

01:10:39.394 --> 01:10:41.096
Jackie.

01:11:45.165 --> 01:11:47.006
You see anything?

01:11:47.815 --> 01:11:49.675
No. Let's go.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:02.775
We checked out the floor, we checked
out the room, didn't find anything.

01:12:02.855 --> 01:12:05.493
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:12:07.055 --> 01:12:09.535
So you're telling me she just left?

01:12:09.615 --> 01:12:14.035
It's been my experience that when
told they're no longer wanted...

01:12:14.115 --> 01:12:16.776
...people like Jackie, move on.

01:12:17.355 --> 01:12:19.676
She called me 20 minutes ago
from this apartment.

01:12:20.655 --> 01:12:23.134
Detective, I have nothing to hide.

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:29.528
I know what you and your sons are up to.

01:12:31.485 --> 01:12:33.592
Please do tell.

01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:43.999
Oh, like I said, feel free to look around.

01:12:46.475 --> 01:12:49.326
As much as you can without a warrant.

01:13:03.955 --> 01:13:06.576
Then if there's nothing else...

01:13:07.455 --> 01:13:08.902
...I'll see you out.

01:13:31.795 --> 01:13:33.636
Where'd she go?

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.933
She was just sitting there.

01:14:26.055 --> 01:14:28.336
No. No, please.

01:14:28.575 --> 01:14:30.946
No. No, please.

01:14:32.155 --> 01:14:35.481
Please! No!

01:14:56.815 --> 01:14:58.970
Well, my dear.

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.056
Now that you've had a chance to see it all...

01:15:02.135 --> 01:15:06.110
...do you still think you'd like
to be a part of our little family?

01:15:09.035 --> 01:15:12.216
- Everything taken care of?
