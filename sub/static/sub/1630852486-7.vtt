08:02.307 --> 08:04.179
She wants to move forward.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.920
She don't want to waste
the pretty on you.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.661
Yeah, but things
are going good.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.967
I mean, I don't want to ruin it
by introducing her to my family

08:10.011 --> 08:11.578
and bringing her
in this house of crazy.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.406
But Kenan, your family
is a big part of who you are.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.582
Look, if you're telling her

08:15.625 --> 08:16.887
that you're not gonna
move forward,

08:16.931 --> 08:18.454
she's gonna pull back.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.543
Nah, girl,
she is all about Zaddy.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.979
Let me show you.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.113
Aw, these are cute.
So cute.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.506
Piggy-back? Okay.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.290
Yes.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.684
Oh. Except for this one
she just posted

08:30.727 --> 08:31.902
where she's with another dude.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.513
What?
No.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.950
This is a picture of her alone
at a coffee shop right now.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.126
Is she though?

08:40.128 --> 08:42.522
Look, I think
you should go talk to her.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.263
And besides, your family's
not that crazy.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.137
<i>Little help?</i>

08:49.180 --> 08:50.442
You were saying?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.532
- I should probably go inside.
- Yeah.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.837
Okay.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.536
Th--This is why I say
no balls in the h--

08:56.579 --> 08:58.059
You know what?

08:58.102 --> 08:59.277
It's just my life. <i>
- Birdie?</i>

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
Then I try not to eat
till noon.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.501
- Yeah, mm.
- Intermittent fasting.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.198
Kenan?

09:07.242 --> 09:08.678
Oh, snap.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.593
Janay!
What're you doing out here?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.639
Besides having coffee
with goofy dudes.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.774
What's up?
I'm Trevor.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.384
'Sup, Trevor?
What you standing up

09:19.428 --> 09:20.603
to your natural height for?

09:20.647 --> 09:21.778
That supposed to mean
something to me?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.301
'Cause it really doesn't, brah.

09:23.345 --> 09:26.217
Will you just, uh,
excuse us for one second?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.741
'Scuse us, Trevor.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.960
- What are you doing?
- What?

09:30.004 --> 09:32.136
I'm ready to risk my life
for this relationship.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.617
Ohh, so now
it's a relationship

09:34.661 --> 09:36.663
and not just a "thang."

09:36.706 --> 09:38.360
Who called it a "thang"?
Was that me?

09:38.403 --> 09:40.275
- Kenan!
- Okay, yes.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.670
This is a real,
going-somewhere relationship.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.977
So you'll include me
in your whole life?

09:47.021 --> 09:48.196
Yes.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.154
We can have family dinner
this weekend.

09:50.198 --> 09:53.680
And I'll tell everybody
that you're my girlfriend.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.942
That sounds sweet.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.335
Yeah, starting
with this dude right here.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.424
Hey, Groot, this is my lady.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.817
It's nice for you to meet her,

10:00.861 --> 10:02.819
but you can go home now, punk!

10:02.863 --> 10:04.647
I'm just kidding, just kidding.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.127
Can I grab her stuff? Thanks.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.476
So nice to meet you.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.782
All right, we'll see you
at the gym, Trevor.

- Yo, Pam,

where the hell are you?

10:16.050 --> 10:17.617
Everyone's already
in the meeting.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.053
Waze gave me
a 20-minute route,

10:19.096 --> 10:20.794
but I knew of a back road
that would get me here

10:20.837 --> 10:22.012
in 15 minutes flat.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.666
You're 40 minutes late, Pam.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.451
Yeah, well,
Waze won this round.

keep stalling, all right?</i>

10:28.149 --> 10:30.760
Oh, oh I see you.
There you are.

10:30.804 --> 10:34.416
Oh, I found a primo spot.
Whoo.

<i>Oh, now this joker's gonna</i> <i>
try to steal it!</i>

10:37.114 --> 10:38.289
Who cares?
Just park anywhere.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.421
There's plenty of space.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.684
No! Everybody knows
that the space

10:41.728 --> 10:44.339
next to the disabled spot
is the best.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.995
Game time. I gotta win this.

That spot is mine!

Oh.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.184
[sighs]
It was a tie.

11:03.227 --> 11:06.230
I hate ties.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.537
Aw man, why don't
you look where you're going?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.365
Do you see what you did
to my car?

11:10.408 --> 11:11.845
Oh, she crazy, crazy.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.673

You are gonna
love this recipe.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.634
I call it "hot girl guac."

11:18.678 --> 11:20.244
My secret
is half a ghost pepper

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724
and a bunch of garlic.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.247
Sounds like tonight
will be the first night

11:23.291 --> 11:25.467
we fart in front of each other.
both: [chuckle]

11:25.510 --> 11:27.469
Look at us, moving forward.

Oh, hey, for our
big family dinner this weekend,

11:30.385 --> 11:31.821
what do the girls eat?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.605
I really want
everything to be perfect.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.738
Oh, well,
Aubrey hates everything,

11:35.782 --> 11:37.435
and Birdie will eat
pretty much anything.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.394
So why don't we go with steak,

11:39.437 --> 11:40.612
'cause that's what Zaddy wants.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.833
[phone buzzes]
Oh, snap.

11:43.877 --> 11:46.488
I'm sorry, hold on one second.
- Okay.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.664
Yeah, what?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.753
Kenan, I'm dropping Pam
as a client, man.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.755
So if I go missing,
go to your computer,

11:52.799 --> 11:54.191
and find a folder
called "Church."

11:54.235 --> 11:55.802
Delete that.
It's full of porn.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.760
Is that
why my computer's so slow?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.153
That and another folder
called "Prayer."

11:59.196 --> 12:00.458
Get back to Pam.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.025
You just signed her, man.
You can't drop her.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.375
But she's out of control,
man, for real.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.942
It's like everything's
a competition with her.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.291

You wouldn't cut and run
on your brother,

to your friend either.

I'm so sorry, but I forgot

we're going out of town
this weekend.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.670
I gotta get a raincheck

Oh, no!

Okay, sure, raincheck.
But only 'cause you're cute.

- You are. You're cute.

gotta go handle

13:35.336 --> 13:36.859
something for work
right now as well,

13:36.903 --> 13:39.035

that "hot girl guac,"

13:39.079 --> 13:42.822

Oh, and it reminds me,
I want a subscription to Starz.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.932
They got a new program on there
called "P-Valley."

You know what
the P stands for?

14:51.716 --> 14:53.501
I have a good idea.
But--

14:55.068 --> 14:57.113
- Let's go this way.
- But the store's right there.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.462
I know,
but the Razor scooter store

14:58.506 --> 14:59.637
is that way.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.509

I'm getting Starz?

15:01.552 --> 15:02.858
- Maybe.
- You rascal.

this lady?

15:18.961 --> 15:20.484
No, I don't.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.922
But I think she might
recognize me from TV.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.184

15:24.227 --> 15:25.968
Well, thank you very much
for watching, ma'am.

have ever met before,

Come on.
- [whispers] Oh, hell no.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.498
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.674
Come on, I know
a pissed off mistress

15:36.718 --> 15:37.893
when I see one.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.286
I know.
She's not my mistress though.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.983
She's my secret girlfriend.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.986
Okay, now I hear it.
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.292
I don't even think
she that mad.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.644
Daang.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.559
She gave you the boot.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.126
Tch.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.955
I don't need you
to be clever right now, Rick.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.220
When you and I were playing
at the company picnic,

16:00.263 --> 16:01.656
you nicknamed me Rally Killer.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.311
'Cause you suck, Phil.
You kill rallies.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.399
Well, it stuck.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.618
My ex-wife called me that
in bed.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.969
"Rally Killer strikes again."

16:10.012 --> 16:12.188
[laughter]

16:12.232 --> 16:13.885
Listen, sex is hard.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.932
All right, buddy.
My turn.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.194
[clears throat]

16:18.238 --> 16:20.675
Pam would be a model employee

16:20.718 --> 16:23.417
if she didn't let
her overly competitive nature

16:23.460 --> 16:25.506
get in the way
of her job performance.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.334
- Is that my evaluation?
- Yes it is.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.465
I told you I'd get you back.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.336
Come on.
This is not the time--

16:29.379 --> 16:30.859
Stop it!

16:30.902 --> 16:33.340
This is getting real janky,
right now.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.168
John McEnroe, please tell Pam

16:35.211 --> 16:37.909
how this type of behavior
has affected your life.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.389
Pam, I get it.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.478
No one is
more competitive than me.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.350
- You want to bet?
- Don't interrupt me.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.699
Okay.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.528
Having dominated
every tennis tournament,

16:47.571 --> 16:49.356
commentated with every major network,

16:49.399 --> 16:54.056
being put in the International
Tennis Hall of Fame--

16:54.100 --> 16:59.409
You know, I only see
an upside in this behavior.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.150
Why am I here?
- I'm starting to wonder

17:01.194 --> 17:02.760
the same thing, Johnathan.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.589
You're starting to wonder?!
[objects clatter]

17:05.633 --> 17:08.896
Fine! I don't want to be here!

17:08.940 --> 17:11.508
Pam, you be you.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.989
Wha--

17:14.032 --> 17:15.730
He's still got it.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.426
Okay, that was dope,
but Pam, for real,

17:17.471 --> 17:18.385
you're gonna tell me
that parking space

17:18.428 --> 17:20.430
was worth your dream job?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.564
I don't know.
I just can't be a loser.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.305
Growing up in a house
full of brothers,

17:25.348 --> 17:26.871
you had to compete
for everything--

17:26.915 --> 17:29.874
desserts, toilet paper,
medicine--

17:29.918 --> 17:31.659
Was that you eating
all my antacid pills?

17:31.702 --> 17:32.834
My chest hurts!

17:32.877 --> 17:35.532
- Hmm?
- Pam, not being a loser

17:35.576 --> 17:38.318
doesn't mean you always win.
Okay?

17:38.361 --> 17:39.493
You lost your dream job,

17:39.536 --> 17:42.452
and you smashed up
your damn car.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.107
Look, all I know is
you gotta make a change.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.544
And as your friend,
and your manager,

17:47.588 --> 17:49.894
you gotta let me help you, man.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.029
Thanks, Gary.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.118
You know, you are
a great manager.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.512
- Thank you very much.
- Better than the last one.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.948
You hear that, butt-turd?

17:59.991 --> 18:03.517
My name is Buttard!
And you know that.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.650
- That guy is such a Phil!
- Such a Phil.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.739
- Such a Phil!
- He's a double Phil.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.524
He didn't flip a chair
or nothing.

18:10.567 --> 18:16.965
Alexa, play "Kenan's Sad Jams
for No Chance at Love-making."

18:17.008 --> 18:20.969
<i>Playing "Kenan's Sad Jams</i> <i>
for No Chance of Love-making."</i>

18:21.012 --> 18:22.797
Alexa, will you be
my girlfriend?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.321
<i>I like you as a friend.</i>

18:25.365 --> 18:26.627
Snap, that's cold.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.543
I don't like
what I'm hearing over here.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.110
What's happened?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.633
It's just Janay stuff.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.287
Mika was right, I think I need

18:34.330 --> 18:35.897
to bring her into my whole life

18:35.940 --> 18:37.594
and introduce her
to the family.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.161
That's the only way
I'm gonna keep her.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.685
But I'm just worried
it's gonna scare her away.

18:41.729 --> 18:44.645
Well, look, man,
the only thing I know is

18:44.688 --> 18:46.125
you can't have
a whole separate life

18:46.168 --> 18:48.605
that doesn't include
your partner.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.478
That's some good advice,
Rick.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.696
Yeah.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.829
I got that
from a Blind Wally song,

18:54.872 --> 18:56.787
called "You Can't Have
A Whole Separate Life

18:56.831 --> 18:58.485
That Doesn't Include
Your Partner."

18:58.528 --> 19:00.878
You had me at Blind Wally.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.621
Hey, Daddy,
like my sign?

19:04.665 --> 19:07.320
Yes, baby, it's beautiful.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.452
Why am I paying $15,000 a year
for that school?

19:09.496 --> 19:12.368
Hey, rich kids are dumb too.
[pounding on door]

19:12.412 --> 19:14.327
Places everybody.
Come here.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.806
Don't forget, yell surprise,

19:15.850 --> 19:17.939
and then curtsy like
the little Von Trapp kids did

19:17.982 --> 19:20.898
when they met
Fraulein Von Nazi Racist Face.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.075
Get ready.
One, two, three.

19:24.119 --> 19:28.341
all: Surprise!
- Surprise!

19:28.384 --> 19:31.257
Oh, God.
They found me.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.564
Look, Officer,
this is my girlfriend's place.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.305
I just used the hide-away key.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.394
Girls, do you know
the woman that lives here?

19:38.438 --> 19:40.004
- Nope.
- Didn't know she existed

19:40.048 --> 19:41.223
till today.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.355
I'm gonna need you
to stand up, sir.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.966
Oh, man, this is ridiculous.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.230
What in the hell?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.753
Lawrence, what is happening
right now?

19:49.797 --> 19:51.233
Janay, we received
a call from a neighbor

19:51.277 --> 19:53.888
about an intrusion.
- Janay, would you please tell

19:53.931 --> 19:55.716
this officer of the law
that you know me

19:55.759 --> 19:57.239
and we have a "thang."

19:57.283 --> 20:00.199
Oh, did we have a "thing,"
or a "thang."

20:00.242 --> 20:01.548
You gonna let them
take my babies

20:01.591 --> 20:03.114
just because you mad?
That's cold.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.595
What are you doing here,
Kenan?

20:05.639 --> 20:08.337
Can--let's just have
a little talk.

20:08.381 --> 20:09.991
- [sighs]
- I'm sorry.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.254
I thought that if I brought
my family over here

20:12.298 --> 20:13.473
to surprise you,

20:13.516 --> 20:15.388
then you would forgive me
for being stupid.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.650
I didn't count on the cops

20:16.693 --> 20:18.913
or Rick's
past criminal history.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.046
Ah, ah, <i>alleged</i>
criminal history.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.005
You really thought
this would make up

20:24.048 --> 20:25.920
for the way you treated me?

20:25.963 --> 20:27.400
I thought
it would be a start.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.272
Look, Janay, I'm really sorry.
I just freaked.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.882
Why?

20:31.926 --> 20:34.102
Because my life
is so crazy.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.104
I thought
it would scare you off.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.062
I mean, look at you.
You're so pretty,

20:38.106 --> 20:40.761
and smart, and put-together.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.676
I got puked on
three times last week.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.678
Gross.

20:44.721 --> 20:45.896
I get it.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.898
You're a father and a brother

20:47.942 --> 20:51.337
and a...whatever you are
to Rick.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.948
But I didn't want
some curated version of you.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.993
I wanted the real you.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.908
The good, the bad, and the--

20:57.952 --> 20:59.345
Oh, I know you're not
about to say "ugly."

20:59.388 --> 21:01.608
'Cause I might be stupid,
but I'm cute.

21:01.651 --> 21:05.307
I was gonna say "human."

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
So...you still want me?

21:07.875 --> 21:10.965
Plant one on me,
right here.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.488
Now introduce me
to your crazy family.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.795
Okay, all right.
Well, that's my baby Birdie,

21:14.838 --> 21:16.971
and that's Aubrey, and that's--

21:17.014 --> 21:18.364
Girl, don't act
like you don't know me.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.843
Get your feet
off my coffee table.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.105
Oh, I will.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.238
<i>I will.</i> <i>
- Now.</i>
