Welcome to Netflix.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.254
Last year, we approved
16 original shows and movies,

00:45.421 --> 00:50.217
and this year, it is our goal
to make that number 1,087.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.220
That's why we here at Netflix
are thrilled to be working

00:53.387 --> 00:56.515
with you two comedy geniuses,
Terrance and Phillip.

01:04.023 --> 01:05.441
Classic stuff.

01:05.608 --> 01:06.859
Now go ahead
and pitch what you're thinking

01:07.026 --> 01:08.736
for your Netflix
original series.

01:08.903 --> 01:12.031
Well, we were thinking
that we'd do a show

01:12.198 --> 01:14.116
where Phillip and I
are on a farm.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.993
With a cow.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.454
Okay,
I love it so far.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.248
The sun is just starting
to come up, and then...

01:21.415 --> 01:23.542
I fart on Phillip.

01:23.709 --> 01:28.380
And I say, "Terrance!
You farted!"

01:28.547 --> 01:30.049
And I...

01:30.216 --> 01:34.470
fart on Terrance.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.347
And then it's like a back and forth kind of thing?
It's sort of like a --

01:36.514 --> 01:40.434
It's like a back and forth
kind of thing.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.146
I fart on him.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.648
He...

01:45.815 --> 01:47.191
farts...

01:47.358 --> 01:48.526
on...

01:48.692 --> 01:49.735
On you. Got it.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.278
No!

01:51.445 --> 01:53.155
On the cow.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.369
Welcome to Netflix,
you sons a bitches! Yeah!

01:58.536 --> 02:00.496
- Hooray.
- Hooray.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.505
Come on, Tweek!
Hurry!

02:09.672 --> 02:11.465
What's going on?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.593
Cartman and his girlfriend
are fighting again!

02:18.430 --> 02:19.765
God damn it.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.058
- Sweetheart!
- Piece of shit!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.521
Honey! I wanna watch
"Terrance and Phillip"

02:25.688 --> 02:27.106
tonight with my friends!

02:27.273 --> 02:28.732
You promised we'd have
a date night!

02:28.899 --> 02:30.693
Ugh!

02:30.860 --> 02:32.278
It's just one night, babe!

02:32.444 --> 02:33.487
Stan is having
a viewing party, honey!

02:34.864 --> 02:36.198
So then why can't I come?!

02:36.365 --> 02:38.117
"Terrance and Phillip"
is guys' night thing baby!

02:38.284 --> 02:39.535
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:39.702 --> 02:41.203
What the hell
are you all doing?!

02:41.370 --> 02:42.746
Watching Heidi
get her bitch-ass kicked!

02:42.913 --> 02:43.956
Fuck you,
Wendy!

02:44.123 --> 02:45.332
Don't take that crap,
Heidi!

02:45.499 --> 02:46.917
Let Cartman have it!

02:47.084 --> 02:49.753
Guys! Guys, this has gone on
way too long!

02:49.920 --> 02:52.756
Can't we all stop being
so mean to each other?

02:55.301 --> 02:56.969
Shut up, Kyle.
You sound like your mom.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.765
That was awesome, baby.
I love you.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.434
I love you, too,
babe.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.227
- Aww...
- Damn it.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.563
Fights over.
Kyle ruined it!

03:11.942 --> 03:13.110
All right, everyone.
Listen up.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.404
As you know, there has been
a lot of bullying

03:15.571 --> 03:17.615
and insensitivity
at our school.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.700
To counteract this,
it is my firm belief

03:19.867 --> 03:21.368
that South Park Elementary

03:21.535 --> 03:24.205
is in desperate need
of a strong woman.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.998
So in looking for
a new vice principal,

03:26.165 --> 03:28.083
we wanted to find
a powerful, intelligent,

03:28.250 --> 03:31.170
and independent female
to be a role model for us all.

03:31.337 --> 03:32.546
And with that said,
I'd like to introduce

03:32.713 --> 03:34.381
our new vice principal --
Strong Woman.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.053
Thank you,
PC Principal.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.763
All right, everyone.
Listen up.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.556
I'm the new vice principal
of the school.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.600
My name is Strong Woman.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.393
I've already spent a few days
here at the school

03:46.560 --> 03:48.229
watching and observing,

03:48.395 --> 03:50.397
and we definitely have things
we can all be working on.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.607
Hey!
Stotch!

03:51.774 --> 03:53.108
You do not disrespect
Strong Woman

03:53.275 --> 03:55.402
by talking
when she's talking.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.363
You really think I couldn't have
handled that myself?

03:57.529 --> 03:59.448
Oh! Uh, I was just
making sure everything was --

03:59.615 --> 04:01.700
You really had to grab the mic
out of my hand like that?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.202
Shit. I mean -- No, sorry.
Sorry, I'm not --

04:03.369 --> 04:04.870
Uh, here you go.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.247
I want the girls
here at this school

04:06.413 --> 04:07.873
to know that they can talk to me
about anything.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.416
But I also want
the boys to know

04:09.583 --> 04:11.752
that what I'm looking for
is a better place for everybody.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.170
Turning this school around

04:13.337 --> 04:14.463
is going to take work
from everyone.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.216
From everyone.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.843
I'm sorry. Am I not
doing this correctly?

04:20.010 --> 04:23.430
No. No. Sorry! I thought I'd add --
Just add for emphasis.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.892
You felt it wasn't
strong enough, me just saying it?

04:27.059 --> 04:30.729
No, I'm --
Uh, I'm sorry.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.815
I'm looking forward to being
your vice principal.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.484
And I'm looking forward to
turning this school around.

04:35.651 --> 04:36.610
All right. Now,
if we have any que--

04:36.777 --> 04:38.279
I'm not finished.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.655
Right!
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.615
Pay attention, everybody!

04:45.244 --> 04:48.247
It's "The Terrance
& Phillip Show!"

04:48.414 --> 04:49.665
On Netflix.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.503
Hey, Terrance!

04:54.670 --> 04:59.133
What did the black lawyer
say to the Muslim priest?

04:59.300 --> 05:02.261
I don't know, Phillip.
What?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.986
Come in!

05:19.153 --> 05:21.155
- Did we miss it?
- It's just starting.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.906
Oh, look, honey --
Kyle's mom is here!

05:23.073 --> 05:24.533
Shouldn't you be at Temple,
Ms. Broflovski?

05:27.036 --> 05:28.370
Hola.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.581
Would you like to buy
some chimichangas?

05:30.748 --> 05:32.499
<i>Sí, mi amigo!</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:35.294
Here. I'll give you
two pesos.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.842
Dude,
that's awesome!

05:45.054 --> 05:46.597
Wha-What's wrong,
dude?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.098
For the first time,
I feel kinda bad

05:48.265 --> 05:50.434
for the person
being farted on.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.311
Ohp. Kyle's mom doesn't like
the cartoon, guys.

05:52.478 --> 05:55.481
Better shut it off.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.192
Baby, I fuckin' love you
so much.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.197
All right, everyone.
Listen up.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.199
As you all know, we've been
looking for a strong woman

06:05.366 --> 06:07.659
to take on the roll of
vice principal at this school.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.620
We couldn't be happier
with the selection we've made,

06:09.787 --> 06:12.164
and we're sure she'll be making
our school a better place.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.333
So with that,
let me turn over the floor

06:14.500 --> 06:16.543
to our new vice principal --
Strong Woman.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.215
Thanks, everyone.
All right. Listen up.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.591
I fully appreciate
that some of you

06:22.758 --> 06:24.635
might be uncomfortable
with me being here.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.804
Earlier today, I noticed that
some faculty

06:26.970 --> 06:30.224
weren't sure whether to call me
Miss Woman or just Strong.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.809
If I were a man,
you'd probably address me

06:31.975 --> 06:33.560
as Vice Principal Woman,

06:33.727 --> 06:34.937
so why would it should it be
any different, huh?

06:35.104 --> 06:38.065
- We good?
- M'kay.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.983
So I've been getting to know
some of the students here,

06:40.150 --> 06:41.360
and I'm definitely hearing

06:41.527 --> 06:43.070
a lot of frustration
and confusion

06:43.237 --> 06:45.280
over issues that all the schools
are facing right now.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.783
I also spent some time
observing in the cafeteria

06:47.950 --> 06:49.410
and was pretty shocked by the
abusive and intolerant language.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.205
Not sure if any of you
have noticed,

06:53.372 --> 06:55.582

We have a lot of work to do

07:15.144 --> 07:16.645
Excuse me.
I-I'm sorry,

07:16.812 --> 07:19.690
but, uh, is anyone else

from over here somewhere.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.409
Excuse me, everyone. I, um -- I need to get
to the restroom.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.618
Sorry.
I'll be right back.

07:44.006 --> 07:44.840
Hold on, hold on.
Over here. Over here.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.644
Join together, let no man --

07:57.811 --> 07:59.062
Ugh!

08:15.412 --> 08:19.333

Hello there, Mister...

09:12.553 --> 09:13.595
Principal, is it?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.389
That's right.
I'm PC Principal.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.932
What's bringing you
in today?

09:17.099 --> 09:19.601
I'm, uh, having this problem
with my ears.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.396
There's like a persistent kind
of a...ringing going on.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.315
Okay.
Can you describe the ringing?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.693
It's, uh,
Hootie and the Blowfish.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.570
You're hearing a song?

09:29.736 --> 09:32.322
Yeah, um,
there's a new woman

09:32.489 --> 09:34.908
that has joined our faculty.
Her name is Strong Woman.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.451
And, uh, she seems
to have set off

09:36.618 --> 09:38.245
some kind of device
in my ears.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.248
So, maybe you're having
some feelings for her.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.166
No, that couldn't be it.
We work in the same place,

09:43.333 --> 09:44.918
so it'd be impossible
for me to like her.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.212
I'm thinking there must be
some kind of device in my ears.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.006
Well, I looked,

09:49.172 --> 09:51.758
and Hootie and the Blowfish
aren't in your ears.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.387
I believe your hearing them
in your mind and your heart.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
Oh, dude.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.141
Bro.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.359
You may enter.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.655
Vice Principal Woman?

10:13.822 --> 10:16.283
Yes?
What can I do for you?

10:16.450 --> 10:17.868
My name's Kyle,

10:18.035 --> 10:19.870
and I've been doing
a lot of changing lately.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.205
I came because I might
be able to offer some...

10:22.372 --> 10:23.790
insight into
our problems here.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.876
Please.
By all means.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.337
You see, there's a culture
at this school

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
that embraces meanness,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.799
and I believe now it comes
from a Canadian TV show.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.010
All the boys watch it.
I did, too.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.803
We all laughed
while they...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.972
farted
on innocent people's heads.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.515
The thing is...

10:40.682 --> 10:42.601
I never felt for the person
being farted on...

10:42.768 --> 10:45.103
until now.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.189
I want to work with you
to try open people's eyes.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.775
Because I get it now.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.986
You want to blame farts?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.946
That seems kind of ridiculous,
doesn't it?

10:56.031 --> 10:57.240
What?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.659
I mean, it's a slippery slope

10:58.825 --> 10:59.576
when we start
pointing the finger

10:59.743 --> 11:01.536
for our own short comings.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.747
But -- But I thought for sure
<i>you</i> would be on my side.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.249
Kind of sounds like something my
mother would say, actually.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.835
What?!
Oh, forget it!

11:11.630 --> 11:13.840
<i>May I have
your attention please?</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:15.634
<i>Mrs. Broflovski,
your tampons</i>

11:15.801 --> 11:16.927
<i>are available

11:17.094 --> 11:19.096
<i>Mrs. Broflovski,
your tampons</i>

11:19.262 --> 11:20.055
<i>are available
at the front desk.</i>

11:20.222 --> 11:21.723
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:26.478
<i>Come on.
We gotta get outta here!</i>

11:28.980 --> 11:32.359

11:32.526 --> 11:34.444

PC Principal?

11:38.073 --> 11:39.324

Oh, yes!

11:39.491 --> 11:40.742
Yes, Mackey, uh...

11:40.909 --> 11:42.369
I just wanted to see
how you thought

11:42.536 --> 11:43.870
it was going with
Strong Woman.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.164
Well, she seems to be
acclimating fine, m'kay.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.416
The kids really respect her.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.167
Do you know, um...

11:49.334 --> 11:51.878
Do you know if Strong Woman
has a boyfriend?

11:52.045 --> 11:52.963
What?!

11:53.130 --> 11:54.339
Nothing.
Just forget it.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.091
Are you out of your
fuckin' mind?!

11:56.258 --> 11:58.885
Askin' if a co-worker is
available in today's times?!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.304
I just wanted to know
because if she's unavailable,

12:01.471 --> 12:03.473
then maybe I can get my head
off of her, all right?!

12:03.640 --> 12:05.600
Oh, boy, this is bad.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.769
This is real bad.

12:07.936 --> 12:08.770
I don't know
how it happened.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.188
I know it's inappropriate,

12:10.355 --> 12:11.606
and yet I can't stop
thinking about her.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.275
I think I'm sick.

12:13.442 --> 12:17.237
Look, this is real fuckin' fire
you're playin' with, m'kay?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.364
I'm gonna get someone
down here from HR!

12:19.531 --> 12:22.367
HR? Is that, like,
Hootie removal?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.202
No, Human Resources!

12:24.369 --> 12:25.787
The people that come in
to make sure everything's

12:25.954 --> 12:27.080
kept on the level.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.333
We gotta get you
back on track!

12:33.378 --> 12:36.590
Is Canada a bad influence
on the United States?

12:36.757 --> 12:40.177
A group of young people called
"Millennials Against Canada"

12:40.343 --> 12:43.346
think so, and we are joined by
their leader, Kyle Broflovski.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.265
Thanks for having me, Tom.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.435
Young man, you say Canada is to
blame for most of our problems.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.062
All I'm saying is that there's
a culture that originates

12:51.229 --> 12:53.106
from Canada which is at least
partly to blame for the state

12:53.273 --> 12:54.524
of our country now.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.109
To respond to this,
we're now joined

12:56.276 --> 12:57.944
by the Canadian Minister
of Streaming.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.071
Thanks for having me, buddy.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.783
Minister, how do you answer
to these angry millennials?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.659
Well, they're pissed off
because their country sucks,

13:04.826 --> 13:06.077
so they wanna point
the finger at us.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.871
I'm saying <i>we're</i>
all guilty, too.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.665
I grew up watching Terrance and Phillip,
and I though it was funny.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.210
So, you thought it was funny,
but now it's not funny?

13:13.418 --> 13:14.795
No. It was never funny,
I see it differently now.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.129
Oh, so you want to censor it?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.589
We don't want to censor it,

13:17.756 --> 13:19.424
we just want to
get rid of it!

13:19.591 --> 13:21.551
Uh-huh.
You sound like a Jewish Mother.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.387
Oh, see?! That's what I'm
talking about right there!

13:24.554 --> 13:27.182
That kind of mean, degrading,
Canadian trash.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.267
Now, I resent that!
I find that racist.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.811
Canadians should care about
the rest of the world!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.229
You are a racist, fwiend!

13:32.395 --> 13:33.772
And if you have a problem
with Canada,

13:33.939 --> 13:35.023
maybe you should talk to
your backward president!

13:35.190 --> 13:36.691
- Maybe I will!
- 'Kay, go ahead!

13:36.858 --> 13:38.068
Maybe I know
the president.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.444
Oh, sure you do,
just like all Jewish moms

13:39.611 --> 13:40.862
because you don't understand
how --

13:41.029 --> 13:42.489
- Stop calling me that!
- Can I finish?!

13:42.656 --> 13:43.490
That's all you know
is how to be mean and --

13:43.657 --> 13:44.991
There's not a --
Can I finish please?!

13:45.158 --> 13:46.618
Because you were all
raised on it yourselves!

13:46.785 --> 13:48.495
Please, can I finish?!

13:50.539 --> 13:51.873
All right, I'm finished.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.209
All right, everyone, listen up.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.586
As you know we want to provide
a safe work environment

13:56.753 --> 13:58.088
for all our employees.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.923
Sometimes feelings do arise

14:00.090 --> 14:02.801
and we are tempted by the devil
to act upon them.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.928
So we've been reaching out
to Human Resources Division

14:05.095 --> 14:06.638
as I think we can all
use someone to tell us

14:06.805 --> 14:09.432
about what is and isn't
considered misconduct.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.142
She has some great advice
for us,

14:11.309 --> 14:13.395
so now please welcome
Heather Conduct.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.938
Go ahead, Miss Conduct.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.023
Hello, everyone,
my name is Miss Conduct.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.859
I'm here to talk about
making sure we avoid

14:19.025 --> 14:21.820
any trouble at this school,
m'all right?

14:21.987 --> 14:23.780
M'kay.

14:23.947 --> 14:24.573
M'all right.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.491
Now, by a show of hands,

14:26.658 --> 14:29.995
who's ever had inappropriate
feelings for a co-worker?

14:38.587 --> 14:41.631
Well, hello there,
little girl.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.926
Are you selling
girl scout cookies?

14:45.093 --> 14:47.512
Why, yes I am.
How about a snickerdoodle?

14:47.679 --> 14:52.809
All right.
You asked for it.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.735
Oh! Oh, I think
I shit my pants.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.739
All right! That's it!
Everyone stop!

15:05.906 --> 15:08.199
We're shutting it down!

15:14.080 --> 15:15.790
We are
Millennials Against Canada!

15:15.957 --> 15:17.542
We demand this kind of bullying

15:17.709 --> 15:19.502
Canadian entertainment
be stopped!

15:19.669 --> 15:21.713
Didn't think I'd live
long enough to see

15:21.880 --> 15:23.882
this all happen again.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.596
More and more millennials
are turning into Jewish mothers

15:29.763 --> 15:32.974
today as they demand
the censorship of entertainment.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.977
The protesters say they're
not giving up and are demanding

15:36.144 --> 15:38.813
to speak with the president
of the United States.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.025
Here you go! Call is
coming in on your phone!

15:42.192 --> 15:43.693
Good give it here!
Yes, hello?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.613
This is the leader of
the Millennials Against Canada.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.907
Kyle, what the fuck
are you doing?

15:49.074 --> 15:51.576
Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking
a stand and doing something.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.537
I realize this doesn't gel
with your nihilism!

15:54.704 --> 15:56.957
Okay, dude. I didn't
want to have say this,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.209
but you're really starting
to sound like your mom.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.418
I'm not like my mom!

16:00.585 --> 16:01.836
I'm gonna make a difference!

16:02.003 --> 16:02.921
It's gonna feel real good!

16:03.088 --> 16:04.631
Kyle? Kyle!

16:04.798 --> 16:06.132
Don't do this man!

16:06.299 --> 16:07.300
You can't mess
with this shit

16:07.467 --> 16:08.718
while You Know Who
is in office!

16:08.885 --> 16:10.679
We're all gonna die!!

16:14.683 --> 16:16.685
M'all right,
so now everyone,

16:16.851 --> 16:18.895
we're gonna do some
role playing, m'all right,

16:19.062 --> 16:22.357
talk about appropriate ways
we can talk in the workplace.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.776
Can I -- Can I get a volunteer
to role play with me?

16:24.943 --> 16:27.153
M'all right?
How about you Mister, uh...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.947
Mr. Mackey.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.491
M'all right, come on up here.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.576
M'all right now,
we're just gonna pretend

16:33.743 --> 16:34.828
it's a normal morning
before work

16:34.995 --> 16:36.538
and we're startin' the day.
M'all right?

16:36.705 --> 16:39.249
Oh, Mr. Mackey,
good morning.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.043
Good morning, uh,
Miss Conduct.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.378
Now did you have
a nice night?

16:43.545 --> 16:45.755
Yeah, yeah, it was good.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.091
M'all right, okay, well,
good luck today,

16:48.258 --> 16:49.592
and I hope that
our working relationship

16:49.759 --> 16:51.886
can continue be honest
and straightforward.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.889
Oh, I'm very open and honest,
I promise you that.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.809
I can see that, you've got
very honest eyes, m'all right.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.436
M'all right, I probably
shouldn't have said

16:59.602 --> 17:00.770
"You have honest eyes,"
m'all right.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.480
That's a bit crossin'
the line commenting

17:02.647 --> 17:04.649
on his physical attributes,
m'all right? That's bad.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.235
I'm gonna stick to just talking
about work only, m'all right?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.362
So, uh, Mr. Mackey,
what methods do you use

17:09.529 --> 17:11.031
for counseling the students?

17:11.197 --> 17:13.283
Oh, I mostly use
a semi-cognitive approach

17:13.450 --> 17:14.868
adapted
by Kiezrick Solomon.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.411
Wow, you studied Solomon?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.413
He was actually my thesis
in college.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.124
Are you serious? Nobody I talk
to has ever even heard of him!

17:21.291 --> 17:22.625
No! Same here!

17:22.792 --> 17:24.669
What made you attracted
to his work?

17:24.836 --> 17:26.671
Well, it's just such
a natural approach, m'kay.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.465
M'all right.
M'all right.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.591
When I read it, you know,
first, I was like,

17:29.758 --> 17:31.634
- "Whoa, okay."
- M'all right.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.261
"This just really makes
sense," you know?

17:33.428 --> 17:35.096
Well, m'all right.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.848
Mmm'kay.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.266
M'all right.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.318
Mister President, you need
to do something

17:48.485 --> 17:50.445
about your millennials!

17:50.612 --> 17:53.865
What do you want <i>me</i> to do?

17:54.032 --> 17:56.284
Terrance and Phillip
are Canada's largest export!

17:56.451 --> 17:59.162
They account for 80%
of our gross national product!

17:59.329 --> 18:01.915
If your citizens mess with them,
they mess with all of us.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.502
Look, I'm president
of the United States.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.088
I can't get involved
in every petty little protest

18:08.254 --> 18:09.881
against a third world country.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.092
Third world country?!
How dare you!

18:12.258 --> 18:13.802
Canada is second world at least!

18:13.968 --> 18:16.346
Now, you listen here,
Mr. Buddy!

18:16.513 --> 18:19.349
Either you stop the embargo on
the "Terrance and Phillip show,"

18:19.516 --> 18:22.102
or we'll bring in our own troops
to stop it ourselves!

18:22.268 --> 18:25.271
Are you threatening us,
you beady-eyed Canuck?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.690
I'm simply telling you
that Canada will do

18:27.857 --> 18:29.526
what it must
to protect itself!

18:29.692 --> 18:32.695
Then I guess both our countries
better be prepared.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.700
And then, you know,
I was looking for

18:37.867 --> 18:38.785
something to get away
from the city.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.203
I've never really been
a city person.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.496
M'all right. M'all right.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.123
I definitely get that.
M'all right.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.207
I like hiking around,
being around in nature, m'kay.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.126
I agree, I agree,
the city's bad.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.920
I love hiking, too. What are
some of your favorite places?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.922
Well you know Mount Evans
is always nice.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.132
M'all right.
M'all right.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.470
What the hell is that?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.430
There's some kind of...

18:59.597 --> 19:01.516
military alert going out.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.518
All right,
military alert everyone.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.853
Let's get to the hallways

19:05.019 --> 19:05.603
and get the students
to the gymnasium.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.564
Come on. Let's move!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.696
It's the National Guard!

19:14.863 --> 19:16.197
The National Guard?!

19:16.364 --> 19:18.575
It's the president!
He wants to talk to you.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.535
Yes, this is
Millennials Against Canada.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.745
Yeah, listen this thing
is kind of escalating.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.789
You people need to
call it quits.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.457
We can't do that,
Mr. President.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.126
Someone has to do
what's right!

19:28.293 --> 19:30.962
What exactly do you want?

19:31.129 --> 19:32.839
What do I want?!

19:33.006 --> 19:34.757
I want a world...

19:34.924 --> 19:37.677
where laughter doesn't come
at someone else's expense,

19:37.844 --> 19:42.056
where people can live freely
without fear of being farted on.

19:42.223 --> 19:46.811
I want a world where you aren't
ridiculed for trying to help!

19:46.978 --> 19:49.772
A world where a nice girl
that I liked

19:49.939 --> 19:52.066
isn't turned into
another Eric Cartman!

19:52.233 --> 19:54.694
These Canadians are
in the way of that world

19:54.861 --> 19:57.280
and everything they do
and everything they have done

19:57.447 --> 19:59.616
needs to be erased
from the Earth!

20:00.825 --> 20:03.036
Geez, I got a little chub.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.666
Let's go!
Everyone to the gymnasium now!

20:08.833 --> 20:10.627
You heard her!
Move it people!

20:13.755 --> 20:15.215
I have to make sure all
the classrooms are empty.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.008
You go take cover
with the kids!

20:17.175 --> 20:18.343
I'm coming, too!

20:18.509 --> 20:20.511
I'm your Vice Principal!

20:20.678 --> 20:22.305
All right, come on!

20:24.224 --> 20:26.059
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

20:26.309 --> 20:28.144
Vice Principal Woman,
I need to ask you something.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.271
- Okay.
- This is very difficult, but, uh...

20:30.438 --> 20:31.898
What? What?!

20:32.065 --> 20:32.982
Well, as you can see,

20:33.149 --> 20:34.442
there is a door
in front of us.

20:34.609 --> 20:35.818
Yes, there is.

20:35.985 --> 20:36.986
I would like to open
this door for you,

20:37.153 --> 20:39.364
however I understand
the gender-based biases

20:39.530 --> 20:41.199
that this could imply.
- Why do you need to open the door?

20:41.366 --> 20:42.742
I don't need to open
the door.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.244
I'd just be opening it
and holding it the same way

20:44.410 --> 20:46.079
I would for Counselor Mackey,
a student, or anyone else.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.497
Somebody's going to have
to open the door,

20:47.664 --> 20:52.335
or we could die out here.
