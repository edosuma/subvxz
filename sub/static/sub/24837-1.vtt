00:16.655 --> 00:19.183
World War II

00:19.258 --> 00:22.189
<i>April 9, 1940. Norway is
occupied by Nazi Germany</i>

00:22.192 --> 00:24.473
<i>and Hitler establishes
"Festung Norwegen"</i>

00:24.568 --> 00:27.771
<i>The German war machine
moves to the far north</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:31.886
<i>and the Allied convoys
suffer enormous losses.</i>

00:48.486 --> 00:51.579
Scotland 1943.

00:51.663 --> 00:55.016
<i>Norwegian soldiers are trained
by the British forces</i>

00:55.079 --> 00:58.614
<i>to carry out vital sabotage
missions in Norway.</i>

01:07.398 --> 01:09.111
Where's your Commander Officer?

01:10.878 --> 01:13.790
<i>Operation Martin Red was
launched on March 24th.</i>

01:13.825 --> 01:17.063
<i>Twelve Norwegian resistance
fighters set sail for Norway.</i>

01:17.144 --> 01:20.946
<i>Their mission: To sabotage
German airfields and installations.</i>

01:21.293 --> 01:25.549
<i>Only one man came back alive.</i>

01:27.635 --> 01:30.911
I'm here to pick up the report
from Lieutenant Jan Baalsrud.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.200
That's him.

01:49.230 --> 01:54.483
<i>The most incredible events in this story
are the ones that actually took place.</i>

02:02.087 --> 02:06.615
12th Man

02:32.580 --> 02:35.206
This is London.

02:35.288 --> 02:39.705
On days like these,
many in Norway may wonder

02:39.789 --> 02:42.331
what the mood must be like
in England.

02:42.830 --> 02:47.247
Are our nerves holding up,
or are we becoming discouraged?

02:47.329 --> 02:50.997
Allow me to reply
with full conviction:

02:51.329 --> 02:53.163
Our nerves are fine!

02:53.454 --> 02:56.246
Our morale is far from weakened.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.954
It is becoming stronger
with every passing day.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.828
Sigurd, come here!

03:57.577 --> 03:59.952
Fire!

04:18.619 --> 04:22.494
On your knees!
Get down on your knees!

04:32.744 --> 04:34.535
They haven't seen you yet.

04:37.201 --> 04:39.327
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.576
I'll only ask you once,
and I advise you to answer:

04:53.659 --> 04:55.033
What is your mission?

05:02.075 --> 05:03.783
What is that?

05:03.868 --> 05:05.200
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

05:11.534 --> 05:13.867
Hey, there's a man over there!

05:13.951 --> 05:17.033
He's getting away!
After him! Hurry!

05:19.492 --> 05:21.617
Come on!

06:02.156 --> 06:03.490
Footprints.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.699
Over there.

06:32.364 --> 06:33.697
He's gone.

07:05.291 --> 07:09.607
~ Day 1 ~
Toftefjord, 30. March

07:41.111 --> 07:42.153
Over there!

07:42.696 --> 07:44.404
Move!

08:28.069 --> 08:30.527
The water can't be more
than zero degrees.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.318
He won't last long.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.943
It's actually colder
than zero degrees, Colonel.

08:34.025 --> 08:35.734
How so?

08:35.818 --> 08:37.734
Because it's saltwater.

09:15.358 --> 09:17.150
Hello?

09:24.525 --> 09:28.150
Can you... help me?
Please.

09:32.899 --> 09:36.149
I'm not dangerous.

09:57.983 --> 10:00.857
I just need to get warm.
Then I'll leave.

10:08.190 --> 10:12.190
If they come here,
tell them I forced you.

10:12.274 --> 10:13.898
That I threatened to kill you.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.023
They're looking for someone
on Rebbenesøy.

10:24.606 --> 10:25.939
Yes.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.730
But the girls picked you up
on Vårøya.

10:30.773 --> 10:32.315
Yes.

10:34.855 --> 10:37.565
So you swam from
Rebbenesøy to Vårøya?

10:39.063 --> 10:40.605
Yes.

10:58.356 --> 10:59.897
What happened to you?

11:00.480 --> 11:02.022
I got shot.

11:02.522 --> 11:04.814
It's okay.
I hardly feel anything.

11:05.063 --> 11:07.272
Because you're frozen stiff.

11:07.854 --> 11:10.229
Let me get you
some dry clothes and boots.

11:11.438 --> 11:15.188
And wool underwear.
And socks.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.229
No, he's my son!

11:25.145 --> 11:27.145
Sorry.

11:35.354 --> 11:37.438
What's the quickest way
to Tromsø?

12:09.435 --> 12:10.477
Translate.

12:12.019 --> 12:14.685
He's Norwegian.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.602
It's getting hard
to keep our spirits up.

12:17.686 --> 12:18.811
Come here!

12:20.436 --> 12:22.394
We have this gentleman
to thank.

12:22.478 --> 12:23.686
What's your name?

12:23.769 --> 12:26.269
- Sørensen.
- Sørensen?

12:27.561 --> 12:29.435
Excellent.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.435
This is good.
Situation descriptions.

12:35.769 --> 12:39.060
But part of it appears illegible.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.852
"Festung Norwegen. "

12:42.519 --> 12:44.602
Not much "Norwegen" left.

13:31.849 --> 13:33.808
- Eleven?
- Yes.

13:36.891 --> 13:38.474
There are supposed to be twelve.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.642
Where is the twelfth man?

13:44.057 --> 13:48.183
The twelfth man?
We chased him into the fjord.

13:48.265 --> 13:49.599
He never resurfaced.

13:49.932 --> 13:51.850
I see.

13:56.723 --> 13:59.266
And where is his body?

14:01.849 --> 14:05.806
Like I said,
he never resurfaced.

14:06.056 --> 14:07.931
How long did you wait?

14:12.391 --> 14:16.098
No.
The water was below freezing.

14:16.182 --> 14:18.224
And the ocean there,
you know...

14:18.306 --> 14:21.265
It is deep and wide.

14:21.349 --> 14:24.765
And he was injured.
He was bleeding.

14:25.015 --> 14:27.931
And still you failed to catch him?

14:29.557 --> 14:32.098
Why are you here,
Wenders?

14:33.056 --> 14:35.180
What are your ambitions?

14:37.597 --> 14:38.805
Have you seen this?

14:40.765 --> 14:43.306
Ambition is rewarded.

14:43.390 --> 14:48.388
In my entire career
I have never lost anyone.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.848
Search every house in the area.

14:51.930 --> 14:55.930
Focus on people
with medical knowledge.

14:56.514 --> 14:59.056
Doctors.
Midwives.

15:01.305 --> 15:03.513
Herr Sturmbannführer.

15:03.972 --> 15:06.264
I cannot emphasize it enough.

15:06.513 --> 15:08.721
The man is dead.

15:09.930 --> 15:11.764
And I'm telling you,

15:11.846 --> 15:15.262
until we find his body,
he's alive.

15:32.762 --> 15:36.013
No one's ever swum that strait,
even in summertime.

15:38.637 --> 15:42.638
- Tromsø is swarming with Germans.
- I still have to go there.

15:43.470 --> 15:48.220
You trying to save the others?
The ones you came with?

15:48.512 --> 15:52.096
Yes. And some
who haven't been caught yet.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.844
Are we close?

15:56.094 --> 15:57.969
We're almost there.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.303
What will happen to us?

16:27.093 --> 16:30.343
- They'll only send us to a camp, right?
- Don't worry about it.

16:34.052 --> 16:37.177
It's impossible
not to worry about...

16:37.260 --> 16:38.843
Shut up!

16:38.926 --> 16:40.510
That doesn't help.

16:42.510 --> 16:46.177
Bjørn.
It's okay to be afraid.

17:00.259 --> 17:02.759
And now
it's your turn.

17:03.968 --> 17:09.010
No! He hasn't done anything!
Leave the boy alone!

17:09.300 --> 17:11.342
No!

17:13.759 --> 17:15.383
Hey!

17:26.340 --> 17:27.633
Right over there.

17:29.134 --> 17:30.551
Thank you.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.092
All for Norway.

17:34.175 --> 17:35.467
All for Norway.

17:52.675 --> 17:54.340
You startled me!

17:54.425 --> 17:56.175
Sorry.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.590
- I heard your husband could...
- No, he isn't here now.

18:03.841 --> 18:05.549
Sorry.

18:09.507 --> 18:13.715
Wait, let me look
at that foot of yours.

18:14.007 --> 18:17.049
There.
That's the best I can do.

18:17.298 --> 18:19.090
You need a doctor.

18:19.174 --> 18:21.049
I have more urgent matters.

18:21.131 --> 18:24.881
If you get gangrene,
nothing is more urgent.

18:25.174 --> 18:29.257
If you see it turning red here,
get to a hospital.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.507
Or you won't have many days left.

18:33.214 --> 18:34.756
Where are you headed?

18:38.965 --> 18:40.840
I have to get to Tromsø.

18:44.839 --> 18:46.922
I thought I'd cross over here.

18:48.464 --> 18:53.589
No, don't go that way.
Go to the Hansens at Karanes.

18:53.672 --> 18:57.880
I delivered Margareth, their daughter.
They're good people.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.546
Hurry!

19:19.089 --> 19:20.922
She's a midwife.

19:24.797 --> 19:28.588
We're looking for a runaway soldier.
Have you seen him?

19:28.670 --> 19:31.045
No.
I've seen nothing.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.920
Our apologies, ma'am.
Let's continue northward.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.963
Thank you for your help.
Goodbye.

19:47.463 --> 19:49.587
Onward!

20:06.961 --> 20:09.211
- The briefcase?
- It's been helpful.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.627
Operation Martin Red
was to strike

20:11.712 --> 20:15.295
the control tower and seaplanes.

20:15.378 --> 20:17.878
- Any news on the twelfth man?
- No.

20:17.962 --> 20:21.295
But we found the names
of two local contacts here in Tromsø.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.669
Bring them in.

20:27.128 --> 20:29.793
- Any news?
- Be patient.

20:29.877 --> 20:31.668
I'm trying something new here.

20:33.794 --> 20:38.294
Hey!
You're supposed to feel the pain.

20:38.710 --> 20:41.876
What a waste of time!

20:41.961 --> 20:44.794
But nobody's asking me,
of course.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.959
Tell me where he is.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.793
Do I really need to remind you
that Heinrich Himmler,

21:12.876 --> 21:15.293
Reichsführer of the SS,

21:15.375 --> 21:17.583
is expecting a report from us?

21:18.208 --> 21:23.043
Herr Wenders, a man can easily survive
twenty minutes in ice water.

21:23.584 --> 21:28.916
He may experience hypothermia.
But his heart will be beating.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.916
He will be able to move.
His brain will still function.

21:34.166 --> 21:39.250
And that means
the twelfth man is not dead.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.542
Damn!

21:56.249 --> 21:57.958
Security Police!
Open up!

21:59.957 --> 22:01.457
Come with me.
Don't try to resist.

22:03.916 --> 22:05.291
Come on!

22:52.623 --> 22:56.248
He's too frail.
Get me another.

23:16.039 --> 23:17.539
Get in!

23:28.580 --> 23:31.955
Keep going.
Keep going!

23:33.412 --> 23:35.329
Down!

23:58.911 --> 24:01.578
I need someone stronger.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.244
Damn it!

25:30.201 --> 25:31.366
Shit!

26:15.491 --> 26:18.074
Who the hell are you?
Margareth, go inside.

26:18.366 --> 26:20.158
- Don't shoot.
- Who are you?

26:25.031 --> 26:27.073
Is this Karanes?

26:27.491 --> 26:31.989
The Germans claimed victory.
Said they caught all twelve.

26:32.281 --> 26:35.698
- There were twelve of you, right?
- Yes.

26:37.531 --> 26:40.614
I'm not stupid.
I heard the rumors.

26:40.864 --> 26:42.447
Something didn't make sense.

26:44.198 --> 26:46.656
So I asked them:
If you caught all of them,

26:46.740 --> 26:48.032
why are you still searching?

26:50.239 --> 26:51.572
Now I know why.

26:51.656 --> 26:54.990
- Did they mention the others?
- No.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.530
I just heard they were caught.

26:57.822 --> 27:02.156
Most were imprisoned.
A few are in the hospital.

27:02.530 --> 27:07.530
Ragnhild helps out there sometimes.
She knows some of the nurses.

27:08.323 --> 27:10.114
And?

27:10.656 --> 27:12.989
I'll fill you in later.

27:47.446 --> 27:49.321
Are you a soldier?

27:51.404 --> 27:55.029
No, not really.
I'm an instrument maker.

27:57.321 --> 27:59.071
Do you make pianos?

28:01.111 --> 28:05.278
No, I make instruments
that you can use to draw maps.

28:07.361 --> 28:09.320
Understand?

28:10.444 --> 28:12.361
So I draw maps.

28:13.903 --> 28:19.319
And once I rode my bike
from Sweden to Norway.

28:20.152 --> 28:22.736
To draw a map of an airport.

28:24.277 --> 28:26.402
But when I returned to Sweden,

28:26.487 --> 28:30.695
a policeman said I was
no longer allowed to draw maps.

28:31.069 --> 28:33.277
So I had to leave Sweden.

28:35.777 --> 28:40.235
Then I went to Russia,
the Ukraine, Turkey,

28:40.693 --> 28:44.152
India, Kenya,
and South Africa.

28:44.528 --> 28:45.778
And then...

28:48.443 --> 28:52.901
...I took a boat over to Brazil.
And went up to Trinidad,

28:53.277 --> 28:56.069
the United States,
and Canada.

28:56.402 --> 29:01.652
And then I took another boat.
To England.

29:02.194 --> 29:04.485
And finally I came to Shetland.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.193
Where I met my friends.

29:09.693 --> 29:11.568
And then I came here.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.652
Why didn't you go to Australia?

29:18.526 --> 29:20.318
You sure know your geography.

29:21.359 --> 29:24.859
A bookworm.
She loves geography.

29:24.942 --> 29:29.526
Farm work, not so much.

29:35.276 --> 29:37.150
Are you ready to go?

29:39.525 --> 29:41.650
Tell me what you know.

29:41.734 --> 29:43.734
All I know is what I heard
at the hospital.

29:43.817 --> 29:44.651
Which is?

29:45.692 --> 29:48.067
There have been mass arrests.

29:48.399 --> 29:51.733
The Germans
found your secret documents.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.984
And the men I came over with?

29:54.441 --> 29:57.024
I heard about one man
called Sigurd.

29:58.232 --> 30:02.067
They say he was tortured
to death.

30:05.150 --> 30:09.358
But another one, Erik Reichelt,
is still alive.

30:09.650 --> 30:11.315
He's in the hospital.

30:13.233 --> 30:15.108
And the others?

30:17.483 --> 30:20.648
They're being executed.
Tonight.

31:29.564 --> 31:31.147
Here you go.

31:36.105 --> 31:38.271
Wow.

31:39.562 --> 31:41.855
This is my entire life.

31:44.897 --> 31:47.021
I'm going to take good care of this.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.646
What are you looking at?

32:00.645 --> 32:03.646
Have the Germans stolen
our northern lights?

32:03.729 --> 32:06.021
No, that's not possible.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.520
My mother used to say
if you can see the northern lights,

32:10.811 --> 32:12.562
you're never far from home.

32:14.895 --> 32:18.270
If you like the northern lights,
you can hide here with us.

32:20.812 --> 32:23.687
We have lots of northern lights
and lots of good hiding places.

32:35.810 --> 32:39.853
My God!
What have they done to you?

32:41.519 --> 32:45.144
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say anything!

32:46.394 --> 32:49.144
No, I believe you.
I believe you.

32:52.185 --> 32:55.351
They haven't found him.
The man who was with you.

32:55.436 --> 32:57.269
They haven't found him.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.811
He's still alive.

33:02.019 --> 33:03.643
He's alive.

33:08.477 --> 33:10.477
I have a wife.

33:12.185 --> 33:14.477
And a daughter.

33:16.393 --> 33:18.435
Give them my best.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.932
I need to go.

34:06.350 --> 34:10.475
How can I help save our country
if I'm in hiding?

34:13.641 --> 34:15.933
Are you going to Tromsø?

34:20.391 --> 34:23.558
No.
It's too late.

34:25.599 --> 34:27.058
I'm going to Sweden.

34:27.141 --> 34:28.556
Why?

34:30.308 --> 34:32.849
Because Sweden is what we call
a neutral country.

34:34.931 --> 34:36.849
I'll be safe there.

34:37.181 --> 34:38.931
That's good.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.389
Since you're so good with maps,

34:43.306 --> 34:45.223
maybe you can show me
where Sweden is?

34:46.389 --> 34:48.014
We are there.

34:55.223 --> 34:58.015
And there... is Sweden.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.055
That's a long way.

35:09.140 --> 35:13.473
All the prisoners out!
Faster!

35:16.555 --> 35:20.680
You disappoint me.
None of them talked.

35:20.764 --> 35:24.722
One was promising,
but he died on me.

35:25.055 --> 35:27.888
Well, well.
What can you do?

35:31.471 --> 35:35.888
Maybe they didn't talk
because there's nothing to say.

35:36.179 --> 35:39.263
Because your man is dead.

35:39.346 --> 35:43.346
I was contacted
by the Reich Main Security Office.

35:43.804 --> 35:47.096
They are waiting for a report.

35:47.388 --> 35:49.763
No.
Not until I am sure.

35:50.804 --> 35:52.179
Fine.

35:55.262 --> 35:57.138
Keep moving!

36:11.095 --> 36:12.553
Know what I think?

36:12.636 --> 36:17.053
I think you are chasing a ghost.

36:19.054 --> 36:22.054
There is no trace of him.

36:22.386 --> 36:25.761
We have searched
every farm and house.

36:28.802 --> 36:32.094
We have spoken with every person

36:32.178 --> 36:35.845
who could have known anything.

36:36.887 --> 36:39.737
<i>God bless</i>

36:39.831 --> 36:44.522
<i>our dear fatherland</i>

36:45.511 --> 36:47.883
<i>And let it like</i>

36:47.966 --> 36:52.511
<i>a garden bloom</i>

36:52.760 --> 36:58.718
<i>Call down your peace
from mountains...</i>

36:59.261 --> 37:03.676
Delays are not appreciated
in Berlin.

37:05.386 --> 37:07.261
Want to go to the Eastern Front?

37:07.594 --> 37:10.343
Himmler will read that report.

37:10.926 --> 37:14.009
And what Himmler reads,
Hitler reads.

37:14.260 --> 37:17.051
You don't want to lie to Hitler,
do you?

37:18.259 --> 37:20.926
<i>As faithful...</i>

39:44.088 --> 39:45.922
I've been told I can trust you.

39:48.422 --> 39:51.505
We've been expecting you.

40:00.045 --> 40:02.170
Jan Baalsrud.

40:09.296 --> 40:10.921
We're almost there.

40:12.421 --> 40:14.004
- Good.
- Here. Size 42.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.836
How did you know?

40:16.920 --> 40:20.337
A tiny fellow like you?
They were the smallest I could find.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.337
Thank you.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.421
Peder.

40:25.628 --> 40:26.878
Peder.

40:55.128 --> 40:57.669
Here, take this backpack.

40:57.753 --> 41:00.794
Some food and extra clothes
for your trip.

41:01.168 --> 41:05.210
You need to hide your uniform
when you get to Lyngseidet.

41:05.461 --> 41:08.586
- And here are my skis.
- I can't take your skis.

41:08.669 --> 41:12.959
I can't keep them.
I'd never forgive myself.

41:13.419 --> 41:16.835
Okay.
Let's go over the plan again.

41:17.251 --> 41:19.793
- I'm going to Sweden.
- Right.

41:20.127 --> 41:23.917
Then to England.
Then change socks.

41:24.459 --> 41:26.626
And come right back here.

41:27.002 --> 41:29.877
Okay.
Look at this.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.002
Here is Lyngseidet.

41:32.292 --> 41:36.293
It's an important hub.
Full of Germans.

41:36.542 --> 41:38.376
But you can't get around it.

41:38.460 --> 41:42.750
The mountains are too steep
on both sides.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.917
They're mostly searching
along the coast.

41:45.168 --> 41:48.668
They won't expect to see you
in Lyngseidet.

41:49.876 --> 41:54.250
Look.
That is Kurt Stage.

41:54.584 --> 41:59.584
He heads the Gestapo up here.
We think he knows you're alive.

42:00.958 --> 42:05.041
They say no one
has escaped him before.

42:05.375 --> 42:08.375
So for him, this is personal.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.875
He'll never let a saboteur
like you get away.

42:12.167 --> 42:16.875
If you make it over to Sweden,
it will be a crushing defeat for him.

43:09.747 --> 43:12.872
Type this up and send it
to Berlin immediately.

43:12.955 --> 43:14.247
Yes, sir.

43:15.997 --> 43:17.705
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.

43:22.247 --> 43:23.497
Excellent.

43:23.747 --> 43:26.080
- Thank you.
- Sure.

43:41.372 --> 43:42.747
This is as close as we can get.

43:45.621 --> 43:47.329
I can wade ashore.

43:47.622 --> 43:51.122
You'd never get dry again.
You'd die.

43:58.287 --> 43:59.454
Give me those skis.

44:06.330 --> 44:07.330
Now you.

44:07.413 --> 44:09.703
No.

44:09.788 --> 44:11.746
Come on.

44:12.038 --> 44:14.828
Wait. There.

44:16.079 --> 44:18.246
Now you look like
a real Northerner.

44:20.246 --> 44:21.871
There's a boat waiting
on the other side.

44:21.954 --> 44:24.786
Just leave it adrift.

44:24.871 --> 44:28.079
So no one knows
where you go ashore.

44:28.579 --> 44:32.079
Once you cross the mountain
you'll reach the border.

44:32.494 --> 44:37.537
If the weather holds up,
it should take two or three days.

44:37.786 --> 44:42.494
At least you have skis now.
So you stand a chance.

44:49.119 --> 44:50.660
Good luck.

45:00.494 --> 45:04.953
To the commander in chief
of the SS and police in Norway.

45:05.036 --> 45:10.411
Provisional report
on the sabotage cutter Brattholm.

45:10.493 --> 45:14.118
On March 29, 1943,

45:14.201 --> 45:17.785
units from the Navy and Abwehr

45:17.868 --> 45:21.534
detained a fishing boat
with Norwegian saboteurs

45:21.618 --> 45:25.284
who had been trained
in Great Britain.

45:26.284 --> 45:28.909
There were twelve saboteurs
on board.

45:29.618 --> 45:32.702
Ten were arrested and interrogated.

45:32.785 --> 45:36.534
And according to the Führer's orders
of October 18,

45:36.617 --> 45:38.909
they were promptly executed.

45:41.284 --> 45:44.450
One saboteur was killed on site.

45:44.701 --> 45:47.534
The final man was last observed

45:47.826 --> 45:50.951
swimming in a Norwegian fjord.

45:51.326 --> 45:56.326
I have personally
made it a priority

45:56.576 --> 46:00.867
to thoroughly investigate
and establish with certainty...

46:02.158 --> 46:06.283
that he could not have survived
in these Arctic waters.

46:35.224 --> 46:39.392
~ Day 7 ~

47:22.822 --> 47:25.198
Hey!
Hey, you!

47:35.447 --> 47:37.655
I thought Norwegians
knew how to ski.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.614
Thank you.

51:29.730 --> 51:34.438
I followed his tracks
straight into the avalanche.

51:34.522 --> 51:37.230
I lost him... here.

51:37.314 --> 51:41.063
Are you sure?
Wenders here thinks he's a ghost.

51:41.146 --> 51:46.563
If he survived, there are three ways
down from the mountain.

51:46.647 --> 51:50.021
Here, here and here.

51:50.356 --> 51:55.646
I am quite sure it was him.
And that he may be alive.

52:02.897 --> 52:04.897
Don't just stand here.
Get out!

52:13.688 --> 52:17.938
- Did you send that report?
- Of course. Immediately, sir.

52:20.770 --> 52:24.771
Excellent.
I just wanted to be sure.

54:05.475 --> 54:07.351
Broken skis.

54:12.141 --> 54:13.891
What is that?

54:18.016 --> 54:19.683
A backpack.

54:26.100 --> 54:30.058
Hey!
Hello?

54:31.850 --> 54:36.017
Can you hear me?
Baalsrud?

54:37.475 --> 54:39.975
Race you to those rocks?

54:41.265 --> 54:44.432
I'm not up for that... right now.

54:44.515 --> 54:47.515
- Please leave.
- Feeling sorry for yourself?

54:47.891 --> 54:49.140
Come on!

54:49.223 --> 54:51.141
Be quiet.

54:51.223 --> 54:54.015
I am quiet.
You're the one talking.

54:54.390 --> 54:58.432
Come on.
Ready... set... go!

56:27.388 --> 56:29.054
Marius Grønvoll?

56:31.013 --> 56:32.803
Marius Grønvoll?

56:35.345 --> 56:38.346
Seen anything suspicious lately?

56:38.636 --> 56:39.971
No.

56:40.053 --> 56:41.595
No suspicious people?

56:48.053 --> 56:50.594
- Good.
- I was wondering...

56:51.678 --> 56:53.636
I was wondering...

56:54.387 --> 56:56.303
How do you become
a Nazi sympathizer?

56:58.012 --> 57:00.595
They don't admit just anyone.

57:00.969 --> 57:03.011
No, that's true.

57:04.887 --> 57:08.219
You must have
real faith in your cause?

57:08.470 --> 57:10.260
Yes.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.720
That patch
on your arm.

57:15.968 --> 57:17.886
Are you proud of it?

57:21.594 --> 57:24.885
How you get one of those,
do you just put your name on a list,

57:24.968 --> 57:26.718
or do you actually
have to accomplish something?

57:30.718 --> 57:32.718
We have checked everywhere.

57:37.301 --> 57:40.968
The man we are looking for
is around 1.75 meters.

57:41.302 --> 57:42.635
Dark hair.

57:42.718 --> 57:46.051
Most likely wearing
a Norwegian uniform.

57:46.427 --> 57:48.843
And he walks with a limp.

57:50.593 --> 57:51.843
Okay.

57:52.092 --> 57:55.092
To help, hide,
or in any way assist

57:55.175 --> 57:58.675
an enemy of the Third Reich
is punishable by death.

58:01.259 --> 58:03.925
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

58:04.008 --> 58:07.342
Right. Good.

58:09.968 --> 58:12.800
We're done here.
Let's go.

58:14.176 --> 58:17.508
We need to keep looking.
On to the next farm.

58:48.091 --> 58:50.340
Yes, one more bite.

59:22.382 --> 59:24.382
Ottar, get out!

59:25.048 --> 59:26.632
If anyone comes,
anyone at all, let us know.

59:26.714 --> 59:28.590
Come. Here.

59:32.382 --> 59:35.172
- We have to get these off.
- We have to get his circulation going.

59:38.590 --> 59:40.090
Do you know who this is?

59:41.215 --> 59:42.256
Yes.

59:46.047 --> 59:48.297
Get all our bandages,
woolen underwear, and blankets.

59:51.506 --> 59:52.713
Hanna!

59:53.755 --> 59:57.421
Hey... you'll be fine.

59:57.505 --> 01:00:01.130
Everything will be okay.
You're safe here.

01:00:04.713 --> 01:00:07.004
I followed his tracks all the way up
to the avalanche.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:10.255
- The avalanche?
- The one from three days ago?

01:00:10.504 --> 01:00:11.839
Yes.

01:00:15.088 --> 01:00:18.588
There are posters everywhere.
We can be shot on sight.

01:00:18.672 --> 01:00:19.713
We know that.

01:00:19.796 --> 01:00:21.587
They'll burn our house
to the ground.

01:00:21.672 --> 01:00:24.213
Like in Telavåg.
They torched everything.

01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:29.838
His feet.
You saw them.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.088
He needs a doctor.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.045
- And Ottar...
- We can't call a doctor now.

01:00:35.587 --> 01:00:37.628
It's too dangerous.

01:00:37.879 --> 01:00:41.379
Why risk our lives
for a man dying of gangrene?

01:00:41.836 --> 01:00:44.212
- He could die at any moment.
- We won't let him.

01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:46.379
We'll help him.

01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:48.211
Use mother's ointments.
Do everything we can.

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:52.128
What if it was me?
If that was me in there?

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:53.669
Hanna.

01:00:54.087 --> 01:00:56.587
This is how we prove who we are
and what we believe in.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:03.003
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

01:01:04.752 --> 01:01:07.877
Ottar has kept guard for six hours.
I'll relieve him.

01:01:14.044 --> 01:01:16.169
He won't be walking anytime soon.

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.919
We found something.

01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:33.627
Come here.

01:01:34.752 --> 01:01:36.627
Obersturmbannführer?

01:01:36.711 --> 01:01:38.669
Sorry to interrupt,
but you need to see this.

01:01:41.793 --> 01:01:45.959
We found it in the avalanche.
Above Grønvoll farm.

01:01:46.544 --> 01:01:48.002
Give me that.

01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:50.460
We found this hat
in the same area.

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.792
Easy, easy. Careful. Here.
Take this.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.375
There.
Lie back down.

01:02:35.354 --> 01:02:40.445
~ Day 13 ~

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:58.207
I told you I'd be here
when you woke up.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:13.998
I've changed your clothes.
And bathed you.

01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:17.498
You got Marius' underwear.

01:03:21.248 --> 01:03:24.081
Marius?
Is he your husband?

01:03:24.164 --> 01:03:27.289
No.
He's my brother.

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:34.206
Who are you?

01:03:35.457 --> 01:03:36.706
Gudrun.

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:39.830
Gudrun?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.955
- What was that?
- Just the animals.

01:03:47.788 --> 01:03:49.580
I never used to be this jumpy.

01:03:50.164 --> 01:03:51.830
Me neither.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:58.121
- Where is my uniform?
- I have washed it.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:03.830
Did you find a map,
or a drawing?

01:04:03.913 --> 01:04:05.621
No.

01:04:12.372 --> 01:04:14.497
How are your eyes?

01:04:18.663 --> 01:04:20.330
Much better.

01:04:20.954 --> 01:04:25.497
And your name is Jan.
Jan Baalsrud.

01:04:27.787 --> 01:04:29.579
You were talking in your sleep.

01:04:33.079 --> 01:04:34.370
Did I say anything else?

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:39.121
Yes, you said a lot.

01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:41.412
Sorry.

01:04:42.828 --> 01:04:46.661
I have vital information
the Germans must never get.

01:04:46.746 --> 01:04:49.662
It would be better
if you didn't know anything.

01:04:54.704 --> 01:04:56.621
Bombay.

01:05:00.744 --> 01:05:02.286
In India?

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.161
Have you been there?

01:05:05.537 --> 01:05:07.120
Yes.

01:05:07.911 --> 01:05:11.452
You talked about the elephants.
And birds.

01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:14.202
And you talked about...

01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:17.661
About dancing in London.

01:05:25.328 --> 01:05:27.994
And you called out.

01:05:28.911 --> 01:05:32.786
For someone named Per.

01:05:35.493 --> 01:05:37.243
Sigurd.

01:05:37.327 --> 01:05:42.577
Erik.
And a lot for Gabriel.

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.243
Listen...

01:05:56.618 --> 01:05:59.909
There's a reason
you've survived, Jan.

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:03.701
There's a reason for all this.

01:06:11.492 --> 01:06:14.325
- Who is that?
- Don't move.

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:16.117
Where is my gun?

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.283
- I've ruined everything for you.
- Not a sound!

01:06:37.784 --> 01:06:39.325
Everyone out!

01:06:49.449 --> 01:06:52.116
We have been here twice before.

01:06:52.616 --> 01:06:55.033
We found nothing.

01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:35.864
You.
What's your name, son?

01:07:36.157 --> 01:07:38.240
No... no German.

01:07:40.406 --> 01:07:44.572
I am... not so
good at Norwegian.

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:48.073
Have you seen the soldier?

01:07:57.697 --> 01:07:59.531
- Thank you.
- Candy.

01:08:00.947 --> 01:08:02.613
Good?

01:09:59.026 --> 01:10:02.359
We have three more farms
to search before dark.

01:10:03.568 --> 01:10:06.985
Before dark?
You're funny.

01:10:22.859 --> 01:10:24.983
Let's get you out of here.

01:10:25.067 --> 01:10:27.817
- Watch his foot.
- Careful!

01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:30.692
There's a cabin on the other side
of the fjord.

01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:36.483
You'll be safe there until we find
a way to get you to Sweden.

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:38.942
Pull!

01:10:41.233 --> 01:10:42.316
Careful!

01:10:51.275 --> 01:10:52.442
Pull!

01:10:52.732 --> 01:10:54.441
Come on!
You'll be fine.

01:10:54.525 --> 01:10:56.608
Quiet!

01:11:12.857 --> 01:11:13.815
- Halt!
- What?

01:11:13.898 --> 01:11:15.898
Come back here!

01:11:15.982 --> 01:11:19.565
I know someone in there.

01:12:26.064 --> 01:12:30.897
Potato.
Here's something to keep you warm.

01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.854
And here's my knife.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:39.562
Don't lose it.

01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:43.396
This is better than the Savoy Hotel.

01:12:43.646 --> 01:12:45.063
What?

01:12:46.478 --> 01:12:50.062
The best hotel in London.
But it can't compare to this.

01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:55.645
Marius, we have to head back before
someone notices we're gone.

01:12:55.937 --> 01:12:57.228
Yes.

01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:02.395
It encourages people
that the Germans haven't found you.

01:13:02.646 --> 01:13:07.687
- I'll be back on my feet soon.
- Take your time.

01:13:08.103 --> 01:13:10.186
You won't get kicked out
of the Savoy Hotel.

01:13:12.979 --> 01:13:14.353
Comfortable?

01:13:14.603 --> 01:13:15.894
Yes.

01:13:16.686 --> 01:13:18.561
Your feet?

01:13:21.228 --> 01:13:22.853
Yes.

01:13:23.312 --> 01:13:26.687
Give me a couple of days, and I'll find
a way to get you across the border.

01:13:31.603 --> 01:13:33.603
Savoy Hotel...

01:13:56.143 --> 01:13:58.518
One Esquire, please.

01:15:09.391 --> 01:15:11.016
Nothing here.

01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:14.933
Let's check the cellar.

01:16:34.805 --> 01:16:36.972
There are tracks in the snow.

01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:00.679
Here he is!
We have him!

01:17:25.386 --> 01:17:27.844
Here he is!

01:23:23.278 --> 01:23:27.965
~ Day 26 ~
Total time at "Savoy Hotel": 12 days.

01:23:49.873 --> 01:23:51.373
Jan?

01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:53.999
It's me.

01:23:54.374 --> 01:23:56.498
It's Marius.

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.164
I've found a way to get you
to Sweden.

01:24:04.622 --> 01:24:06.580
That's good news.

01:24:24.205 --> 01:24:26.039
What happened here?

01:24:27.081 --> 01:24:31.997
Gangrene.
It was eating its way up.

01:24:32.081 --> 01:24:34.080
I had to stop it.

01:24:34.746 --> 01:24:35.996
How does it feel now?

01:24:36.621 --> 01:24:38.663
It feels better.

01:24:42.455 --> 01:24:44.163
Put him down here.

01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:52.038
Okay!

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.953
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:25:04.413 --> 01:25:06.663
Here, it's cold.
Put this on.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.996
And now this.

01:25:17.704 --> 01:25:19.621
No, around there.
There.

01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:21.911
Move your hand.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.536
And pull!

01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:27.454
The other one.

01:25:34.202 --> 01:25:36.452
Give him that.

01:25:36.537 --> 01:25:39.162
Here.
Eat some of this.

01:25:39.244 --> 01:25:40.828
Thank you.

01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:57.286
I think we got everything
out of there.

01:25:58.411 --> 01:26:00.494
Except the smell.

01:26:00.744 --> 01:26:04.326
You'll get plenty of fresh air
up in the mountains.

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:08.077
Someone from Manndalen
will meet us.

01:26:08.326 --> 01:26:10.451
They'll get you across the border.

01:26:11.119 --> 01:26:13.327
Does this sled stop in Sweden?

01:26:15.327 --> 01:26:17.035
We'll see.

01:26:19.743 --> 01:26:21.784
Wait, wait.

01:26:52.366 --> 01:26:54.283
Hold it there!

01:26:55.909 --> 01:26:59.408
Can you turn the sled around?

01:26:59.491 --> 01:27:02.366
Stop. Let's switch ropes.
Hold there.

01:27:04.824 --> 01:27:07.199
- Okay, I've got him.
- Pull!

01:27:09.534 --> 01:27:10.782
Come on.

01:27:13.157 --> 01:27:14.825
Plane!

01:27:37.741 --> 01:27:41.699
He's passed out.
Turn him back around.

01:27:44.323 --> 01:27:46.323
Pull!

01:28:09.615 --> 01:28:15.448
I told them to meet us by the big rock.
We'll have to leave you here.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:19.989
We need to hurry back home.

01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:23.905
If they find me,
they'll find you too.

01:28:25.156 --> 01:28:26.823
It's okay.

01:28:26.905 --> 01:28:31.071
This new sleeping bag
is dry and warm. I'll be fine.

01:28:31.363 --> 01:28:35.071
The Manndalen boys
will be here soon.

01:28:35.155 --> 01:28:38.321
They'll use the code word
"Hello, gentleman. "

01:28:39.822 --> 01:28:41.363
Gentleman?

01:28:41.696 --> 01:28:44.946
Yes.
We felt that suited you best.

01:28:48.029 --> 01:28:50.071
Focus on Sweden.

01:29:32.444 --> 01:29:34.778
Isn't it fascinating?

01:29:35.029 --> 01:29:39.195
Why don't they like us,
these Norwegians?

01:29:39.487 --> 01:29:41.944
And our fugitive...

01:29:42.237 --> 01:29:45.403
He has turned
Operation Martin Red

01:29:45.487 --> 01:29:48.027
into a complete success!

01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:51.820
There.
See that?

01:29:53.945 --> 01:29:55.778
Did you see that?
The monogram?

01:29:57.485 --> 01:30:00.361
Their king.
Him they love.

01:30:00.444 --> 01:30:02.818
They're getting bolder by the day.

01:30:02.902 --> 01:30:06.485
The last thing we need now

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:09.361
is for them to find a new symbol.

01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:45.731
Where do you think he is now?

01:31:45.815 --> 01:31:51.315
I hope he's in Sweden
surrounded by cute, Swedish nurses.

01:31:54.982 --> 01:31:56.481
So do I.

01:31:56.564 --> 01:31:58.231
Do you?

01:32:00.731 --> 01:32:02.148
Marius Grønvoll?

01:32:08.482 --> 01:32:10.273
That's me.

01:32:12.147 --> 01:32:15.355
- Where can we speak in private?
- Right here.

01:32:19.272 --> 01:32:22.272
- Who are you?
- Better if you don't know.

01:32:22.355 --> 01:32:24.563
Our gentleman
hasn't been found.

01:32:24.647 --> 01:32:28.105
We've searched
both day and night.

01:32:28.397 --> 01:32:32.439
But... it's been four days.

01:32:32.938 --> 01:32:34.980
Why didn't you come sooner?

01:32:35.063 --> 01:32:38.731
Just mark that stone
in Olmmaijarvi better and we'll find him.

01:32:38.813 --> 01:32:41.396
- Where?
- Olmmaijarvi.

01:32:42.313 --> 01:32:45.188
It wasn't Olmmaijarvi.
It was Olmmaivaggi.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:51.438
I'll go mark the stone.

01:32:53.437 --> 01:32:55.230
I'm coming with you.

01:32:55.313 --> 01:32:58.522
- What about Hanna and Ottar?
- They'll be asleep.

01:32:58.604 --> 01:33:01.438
- And the animals?
- I've fed them.

01:33:01.522 --> 01:33:04.480
- What if the Germans come?
- Then you should be here.

01:33:04.563 --> 01:33:05.937
- Ottar can talk to them.
- He's ten years old.

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:09.187
Hanna can talk to them.
I'm going.

01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:11.354
You're too fond of him, Gudrun.

01:33:11.896 --> 01:33:13.312
No.

01:33:13.395 --> 01:33:15.812
We don't know what to expect.

01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:17.770
- If he's dead...
- He's not dead!

01:33:17.854 --> 01:33:20.438
If you lose it up there,
I don't know what I'll do.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.188
He isn't dead!

01:33:25.646 --> 01:33:27.186
I'm bringing Agnete.

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:31.271
She has nursing experience.

01:34:03.061 --> 01:34:04.560
Here!

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.101
Hello, gentleman?

01:34:36.352 --> 01:34:41.017
Hey... it isn't your fault.

01:35:01.018 --> 01:35:03.142
Marius... Marius!

01:35:08.517 --> 01:35:11.559
What are you doing here?
Someone else was supposed to come.

01:35:11.642 --> 01:35:14.309
There was a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:16.349
- I promise. Can you take over?
- Yes.

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:23.682
I'll go mark the spot.

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.017
Warm soup.
Hope you like peas.

01:35:35.974 --> 01:35:38.015
Marius is a good man.

01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:47.598
- When did you run out of food?
- I'm not out of food.

01:35:52.681 --> 01:35:56.848
Here. One lick for breakfast.
Dinner, one lick.

01:35:57.848 --> 01:36:02.306
Supper.
And a little extra for the weekend.

01:36:07.890 --> 01:36:09.765
Let me tell you something.

01:36:13.098 --> 01:36:16.597
You're this close.
This close.

01:36:19.223 --> 01:36:22.098
You've brought us hope.

01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:26.972
Give my best to Gudrun.

01:36:40.763 --> 01:36:42.930
He's alive.

01:36:45.805 --> 01:36:47.597
And he says hi.

01:37:13.054 --> 01:37:15.721
He's here.
Come!

01:37:15.805 --> 01:37:18.303
Hello... gentleman?

01:37:18.387 --> 01:37:20.928
- Marius?
- No. I'm Nigo.

01:37:21.013 --> 01:37:23.512
Me and these boys
are bringing you to Sweden.

01:37:23.763 --> 01:37:29.179
You must be lousy skiers,
since you took so long.

01:37:29.262 --> 01:37:30.387
Had I known you were this skinny,

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.387
I would have come alone
and carried you myself.

01:37:38.679 --> 01:37:42.178
- We can't make it!
- Yes, we can!

01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:44.887
We have to keep going!

01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:30.844
Are we in Sweden?

01:38:30.926 --> 01:38:32.218
No.

01:38:32.635 --> 01:38:35.885
We hit a blizzard
and had to turn back.

01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:43.467
- Turn back?
- Yes.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.218
- You turned back?
- Just a few kilometers.

01:38:51.134 --> 01:38:54.009
- Have we backtracked?
- We're in Manndalen.

01:38:56.885 --> 01:38:59.843
- You promised to take me to Sweden!
- And I will.

01:39:00.217 --> 01:39:03.217
- You said you'd get me across the border.
- Listen!

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:06.093
- Why did you turn back?
- There was a blizzard!

01:39:06.176 --> 01:39:08.009
I continued to the border
to scout our route.

01:39:08.092 --> 01:39:09.550
And it was good we turned back.

01:39:09.633 --> 01:39:13.175
There are Germans everywhere.

01:39:13.259 --> 01:39:18.883
There are so many guard posts,
each is within sight of the next.

01:39:22.509 --> 01:39:25.342
- Then there's no hope.
- Yes, there is!

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.842
Look at me, Nigo.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.842
I'm skin and bones.

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:37.258
It will be a miracle if I survive.
Do you understand that?

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.466
That's why I'm going to help you.
Because we need a miracle.

01:40:17.632 --> 01:40:19.507
Are you taking my gun?

01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:21.547
Yes, I think that's best.

01:40:23.173 --> 01:40:25.215
But I need to protect myself.

01:40:25.298 --> 01:40:27.630
Promise not to use it on yourself?

01:41:01.171 --> 01:41:02.922
Get moving!

01:41:03.004 --> 01:41:05.587
All hands on deck!

01:41:05.672 --> 01:41:07.713
Down!

01:41:07.797 --> 01:41:08.838
The briefcase!

01:41:08.922 --> 01:41:10.379
Hold the fuse.

01:41:41.836 --> 01:41:43.294
It wouldn't light!

01:42:03.627 --> 01:42:04.960
Jan!

01:42:07.585 --> 01:42:09.503
Jan!

01:42:22.961 --> 01:42:24.627
Who are you?

01:42:25.293 --> 01:42:27.418
I'm Aslak Fossvoll.

01:42:28.002 --> 01:42:30.169
Eat your soup while it's warm.

01:42:30.876 --> 01:42:33.251
I brought you a fresh pair of socks.
You sure need them.

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:03.792
See anything?

01:43:04.293 --> 01:43:06.126
No.

01:43:07.208 --> 01:43:10.042
Don't tell me the Germans have stolen
our northern lights as well.

01:43:16.416 --> 01:43:18.167
Binoculars, Jan.

01:43:29.625 --> 01:43:31.459
Kill the engine.

01:43:36.583 --> 01:43:38.375
I found it.

01:43:40.374 --> 01:43:42.499
We are... here.

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:45.915
- They are everywhere.
- Do we have a local contact?

01:43:46.957 --> 01:43:51.998
Our mission
was to destroy strategic targets.

01:43:57.123 --> 01:43:59.540
There were twelve of us.

01:44:02.957 --> 01:44:05.248
We had eight tons
of explosives on board.

01:44:08.332 --> 01:44:11.498
But we couldn't land
where we first planned.

01:44:12.124 --> 01:44:14.706
So we had to find a new contact.

01:44:17.789 --> 01:44:19.457
What's the contact's name?

01:44:20.749 --> 01:44:22.540
Anaton Pedersen.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.290
Anaton Pedersen?

01:44:27.832 --> 01:44:28.957
He's dead.

01:44:29.915 --> 01:44:31.455
And you are?

01:44:31.539 --> 01:44:34.165
Håkon.
Håkon Sørensen.

01:44:37.248 --> 01:44:41.164
The information we had
was outdated.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.663
And the person we talked to
couldn't be trusted.

01:44:46.748 --> 01:44:48.539
Get me the police.

01:44:48.623 --> 01:44:52.539
Start the engine!
Start the engine!

01:44:52.622 --> 01:44:54.206
When we returned,

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:58.705
we had no time
before we were discovered.

01:44:58.788 --> 01:45:00.871
Then everything fell apart.

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:24.120
We had a briefcase
full of information.

01:45:24.205 --> 01:45:25.495
Get going!

01:45:27.413 --> 01:45:29.953
We tried to destroy the evidence.

01:45:33.953 --> 01:45:36.495
I was the last man overboard.

01:45:38.829 --> 01:45:40.245
They took everyone.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.871
I was the only one who got away.

01:45:48.536 --> 01:45:50.828
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

01:45:53.744 --> 01:45:56.328
Everyone who helps me...

01:45:59.202 --> 01:46:00.869
is risking their life.

01:46:04.244 --> 01:46:07.369
I don't know if anyone
has been killed because of me.

01:46:11.036 --> 01:46:16.161
The worst part is not knowing.

01:46:30.536 --> 01:46:36.119
These men have battled
in the trenches for months.

01:46:36.202 --> 01:46:39.869
And they continue fighting
to defeat the enemy.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.410
Giving everything
for the fatherland.

01:46:43.494 --> 01:46:47.909
The bloodthirsty Soviets
have met their match.

01:46:48.951 --> 01:46:51.992
In Norway,
a successful operation

01:46:52.076 --> 01:46:55.827
led by Lieutenant Colonel
Kurt Stage,

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:58.910
intercepted a fishing vessel.

01:46:59.659 --> 01:47:03.992
Stage reports that twelve saboteurs
were captured.

01:47:04.243 --> 01:47:08.326
And that the operation
was a complete German success.

01:47:24.616 --> 01:47:26.033
Damn it!

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.533
What is this?

01:47:39.116 --> 01:47:40.991
Halt!

01:48:45.572 --> 01:48:49.489
This is London, transmitting
on a 1,500-meter long wave,

01:48:49.573 --> 01:48:53.323
one wave at 19 meters,
two at 31 meters,

01:48:53.406 --> 01:48:55.656
and one at 41 meters.

01:48:55.739 --> 01:49:00.196
I sit by this microphone
not to report accidents,

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:04.529
but to bring greetings
to all compatriots listening.

01:49:04.613 --> 01:49:07.988
I make myself the spokesman
for everything we achieve together.

01:49:09.779 --> 01:49:12.529
And I hope every listener
at this moment

01:49:12.613 --> 01:49:15.862
feels how strong every man's heart

01:49:16.238 --> 01:49:18.655
is beating along with his own.

01:49:21.363 --> 01:49:23.738
Someone was just here.

01:49:24.154 --> 01:49:26.737
No one's been here for two days.

01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:39.737
We still can't move him.

01:49:40.196 --> 01:49:42.363
This doesn't look good.

01:50:03.861 --> 01:50:06.194
Have you lost the map?

01:50:10.027 --> 01:50:12.862
I know you'll find your way.

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:19.945
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

01:50:24.028 --> 01:50:27.736
- Congratulations!
- Today is a special day.

01:50:27.818 --> 01:50:33.026
Happy Constitution Day.
Hooray for Norway.

01:50:39.777 --> 01:50:44.193
May 17.
And no aquavit?

01:50:51.235 --> 01:50:54.859
The eggs are from Olaf.

01:50:55.402 --> 01:50:59.527
And the syrup is from Ludvig.
The cream is from Peder.

01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:03.150
Even though the Germans
have raided his place four times lately.

01:51:04.985 --> 01:51:07.026
And Signe baked it.

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:11.568
Their eight-year old
made the flag for you.

01:51:11.943 --> 01:51:14.276
Happy 17th of May, Jan.

01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:17.901
God bless our dear fatherland.

01:51:21.526 --> 01:51:24.317
- Is the snow melting?
- Yes.

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:33.067
Then how will you pull me
across on a sled?

01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:35.441
We aren't sure
you're strong enough, Jan.

01:51:41.025 --> 01:51:42.524
I'm sure.

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.691
This isn't about me anymore.

01:52:07.607 --> 01:52:12.524
These Northerners are useless.
But the Sami are even worse.

01:52:17.607 --> 01:52:20.357
May I ask what
you were talking about?

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.898
Yes, you may.

01:52:24.857 --> 01:52:26.607
What were you talking about?

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:32.647
He asked when the snow
normally melts on the plateau.

01:52:32.731 --> 01:52:34.272
And you told him?

01:52:34.357 --> 01:52:37.856
I told him the truth.

01:52:38.648 --> 01:52:39.939
Which is?

01:52:41.523 --> 01:52:46.273
Only the gods know.

01:52:47.355 --> 01:52:52.355
But I'd move him pretty soon
if I were you.

01:52:52.647 --> 01:52:55.356
I know for a fact this snow

01:52:55.855 --> 01:52:58.272
isn't going to last.

01:52:59.231 --> 01:53:01.981
The Baal brothers
are moving their herd

01:53:02.063 --> 01:53:05.896
across the border
in a few days.

01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:29.647
My name is Aslak Baal.

01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:31.771
Jan Baalsrud.

01:53:31.855 --> 01:53:34.270
There's still one bullet left.

01:53:35.437 --> 01:53:37.854
Sorry I lost my temper.

01:53:37.938 --> 01:53:39.896
Good to see you're human too.

01:53:44.812 --> 01:53:46.978
You need to go.

01:53:51.728 --> 01:53:55.145
Marius, you know that kerchief
mother gave me?

01:53:56.562 --> 01:53:58.604
I gave it to Jan.

01:53:59.646 --> 01:54:02.186
Did you check that nothing
was left behind?

01:54:04.145 --> 01:54:06.020
Did you check?

01:54:06.104 --> 01:54:10.644
I was focused on Jan.
I don't know if anything was left.

01:54:11.103 --> 01:54:14.727
- Why is that so important?
- It has my initials on it!

01:54:46.185 --> 01:54:51.809
How do you intend to hide
a fugitive like me in broad daylight?

01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.019
We have a plan.

01:55:18.183 --> 01:55:19.893
Once near the border,

01:55:19.976 --> 01:55:23.184
I'll go ahead and steer the herd
in the right direction.

01:55:26.767 --> 01:55:31.476
We'll give you our strongest animal.
One that knows the route well.

01:55:34.726 --> 01:55:37.392
It won't give up
until you're across.

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.892
If things go wrong
and they capture me,

01:55:45.975 --> 01:55:49.267
I'd rather die
by a Norwegian bullet.

01:55:52.433 --> 01:55:54.142
Deal.

01:56:44.057 --> 01:56:48.325
~ Day 63 ~

01:56:49.556 --> 01:56:51.556
Guard change!

01:57:02.889 --> 01:57:07.222
He seems to have spent weeks
in this cabin.

01:57:07.306 --> 01:57:09.596
We found leftover food.

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.888
Fuel and candles.
We have long suspected this.

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:17.138
We think he stayed here a while.

01:57:18.346 --> 01:57:22.471
Ready? The border is coming up.
Not far to go now!

01:58:16.594 --> 01:58:18.594
Is this yours?

01:58:22.387 --> 01:58:26.095
Answer the question!
Is that your toe?

01:59:00.093 --> 01:59:01.719
I want to know where he is!

02:00:34.214 --> 02:00:37.048
Careful!
He may be armed.

02:00:52.173 --> 02:00:53.256
Stop!

02:01:03.839 --> 02:01:04.881
This is Guard Tower 6.

02:01:12.797 --> 02:01:14.797
Yes, what is it?

02:01:53.253 --> 02:01:55.670
There's a reason for this.

02:01:57.462 --> 02:02:00.628
There's a reason
you've survived, Jan.

02:03:46.001 --> 02:03:48.084
What?

02:05:20.914 --> 02:05:23.206
Jan.
It's over now.

02:05:29.289 --> 02:05:31.122
You can let go, Jan.

02:05:33.289 --> 02:05:35.414
It's over now.

02:05:36.871 --> 02:05:39.246
You're safe.

02:05:41.204 --> 02:05:43.080
You can let go.

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:28.302
3 months later

02:08:01.534 --> 02:08:05.116
Listen.
Don't be afraid.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:11.116
We'll put an end
to this madness.

02:08:27.104 --> 02:08:31.714
<i>Jan Baalsrud continued to train new
recruits until Norway was liberated.</i>

02:08:31.718 --> 02:08:35.197
<i>The war ended on May 8, 1945.</i>

02:08:36.376 --> 02:08:41.138
<i>Kurt Stage was sentenced to death
for war crimes and executed in 1947.</i>

02:08:41.948 --> 02:08:45.969
<i>Marius Grønvoll
married Agnete Lanes.</i>

02:08:46.004 --> 02:08:50.367
<i>They raised five children
at Grønvoll farm.</i>

02:08:52.143 --> 02:08:57.481
<i>Gudrun eventually
married 20 years later.</i>

02:09:00.848 --> 02:09:04.701
<i>Jan Baalsrud was honored with the
St. Olav's medal with oak branch</i>

02:09:04.741 --> 02:09:09.067
<i>and appointed honorary member of the
order of the British Empire for his service.</i>

02:09:09.882 --> 02:09:13.047
<i>Jan Baalsrud never
saw himself as a hero.</i>

02:09:13.126 --> 02:09:17.405
<i>He believed the men and women who
kept him alive were the real heroes.</i>

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:21.338
<i>Jan died in 1988, and by his
own wishes was laid to rest</i>

02:09:21.342 --> 02:09:24.508
<i>in Manndalen among those
who helped him.</i>
