00:21.254 --> 00:22.621
Wow.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.757
The inset is perfect.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.358
All right, it's ready.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.060
And you're positive?

00:28.062 --> 00:28.060
Yes, thank you
for your Patience.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.730
I know I've sent it back a
few times for adjustments...

00:31.732 --> 00:33.465
Five.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.701
Five times.
Yeah.

00:35.703 --> 00:43.108
Well, I hope you and your future
bride will live happily ever after.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.345
I hope you live happily
ever after yourself.

00:48.181 --> 00:52.317
Nothing's gonna happen for me until
I get these bangs figured out.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.245
- Roger!
- Hey.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.381
Congressman McClaren
should be here at 11:41.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.083
Is this the rewrite on his speech?
Yeah.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.551
Good. Good.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.553
Let's cut this section. Start
with "born in Seattle"

01:27.555 --> 01:29.221
and go into the
dedication of troops.

01:29.223 --> 01:29.221
Okay so, wait...

01:29.223 --> 01:31.590
Actually no, I'll do that. Okay.

01:31.592 --> 01:31.590
Do you want me
to run a sound check?

01:31.592 --> 01:35.327
Already did that. Are there too
many red balloons on this side?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.796
Um. Maybe. Do you want
me to do something?

01:37.798 --> 01:40.532
Yeah. Grab the raw veggies out
of my car and put them on ice?

01:40.534 --> 01:41.600
Okay.

01:44.893 --> 01:46.272
Roger.
Hey, Riggleman,

01:46.273 --> 01:49.308
are these balloons symmetrical?

01:50.143 --> 01:52.211
We have a situation.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.248
This is the a Cappella
group, the founding fathers.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.250
They're the opening act
for frank.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.618
Ah. Gentlemen,
I'm Roger Fellner,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.386
congressman McClaren's
chief of staff.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.754
What seems to be the problem?

02:02.756 --> 02:05.824
Well, our bass is drunk.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.627
If it's talk about me,
I'm right here.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.163
You have a problem, Gabe!

02:11.165 --> 02:12.531
Don't provoke him, please.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.268
Uh, if I may suggest something?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.570
If you three switch your
baritone to a bassitone

02:18.572 --> 02:20.506
and then you transpose
it up half a step,

02:20.707 --> 02:20.706
you'll still have a nice,
clean three-part Harmony.

02:20.708 --> 02:25.310
It's not going to be perfect, but
they won't know the difference.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.191
I see why one of
them had to drink.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.704
<i>I've been coming
to this festival</i>

02:52.706 --> 02:54.640
<i>for longer than I can remember,</i>

02:54.642 --> 02:58.710
<i>but somehow the funnel cake
keeps getting tastier.</i>

03:01.381 --> 03:03.448
<i>I was born and raised
here in Seattle...</i>

03:03.450 --> 03:05.184
Whoo!

03:05.186 --> 03:06.285
No, no, no.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.954
Guess what?
I'm the best!

03:09.355 --> 03:11.557
Cowabunga!

03:14.328 --> 03:15.328
Oh!

03:16.563 --> 03:17.896
Is he okay?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.870
<i>Might be time to check the
prescription on those bifocals, Ben.</i>

03:26.673 --> 03:28.640
Frank, I take
full responsibility.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.209
I don't think any clips
will end up on YouTube...

03:30.211 --> 03:32.377
Roger, lighten up.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.714
I recovered. That
bifocal line destroyed.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.716
And just off the top of
your head I was like,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.585
"am I watching
<i>whose line is it anyway?"</i>

03:39.587 --> 03:41.386
Oh. Thank you.
That's my favorite show.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.488
I've decided not to
run for re-election.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.792
Oh, my... are you okay?
Is it your health or...

03:46.794 --> 03:48.527
I'm fine.
My wife left me...

03:48.529 --> 03:51.463
Oh! That bitch!
...A note, Roger.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.367
She left me a note
saying that she missed me.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.868
You know, it made me
realize I miss her, too.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.937
Now, I know it doesn't
give you much time...

03:58.939 --> 04:00.405
You've given me more than
time, you've given me...

04:00.407 --> 04:02.474
You need to let me complete
my sentences, Roger.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.443
Time to campaign.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.645
I think that you
should run for my seat.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.779
There's no one more qualified...

04:07.781 --> 04:09.448
Yes. I will do it.

04:09.749 --> 04:09.748
You don't need to
give me an answer now.

04:09.750 --> 04:09.748
You can discuss it with your family.
I'll do it. I want it.

04:09.750 --> 04:15.520
I'm definitely prepared. I think
education reform should be my...

04:15.522 --> 04:16.887
Roger, take a deep breath.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.957
I want you to really
think about this.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.293
This job consumes
every part of you.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.428
Now, I'm telling you now so you
have the vacation to consider.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.530
And when we get back,
if you still want it,

04:25.532 --> 04:27.599
you have my full endorsement.

04:27.601 --> 04:27.599
Sir, I cannot thank you enough.

04:27.601 --> 04:32.971
This is my dream... My whole life...
since fifth-grade student council

04:32.973 --> 04:33.973
I knew that...

04:35.875 --> 04:38.810
I'm sorry if I seem a little distracted
but drunk Ben Franklin is back,

04:38.812 --> 04:41.313
and I just want to make sure that
baby he's holding is his baby.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.315
Yes, you should do that. Okay!

04:43.317 --> 04:45.384
See you in a week.
So grateful. Thank you!

04:46.953 --> 04:48.553
Hey, is that your baby?
Yes, it is.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.422
Is that your baby?
This is my baby.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.458
I am speechless. Come on. I
couldn't do it without you.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.993
That's not true. No,
that's not entirely true.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.795
I could probably do
a fair amount, but...

04:56.797 --> 04:59.998
Riggleman, will you
be my campaign manager?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.636
Of course, Roger! Yes.
A hundred times, yes!

05:04.638 --> 05:06.438
Sure, sure. I'll get
started right away.

05:06.440 --> 05:06.438
I'll get a scout,
get headquarters...

05:06.440 --> 05:10.809
Well don't break your back, you
know, enjoy your vacation.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.645
Uh, all I have planned
is mother's birthday.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.015
Well, that's nice.
No, it's not nice.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.818
All she wanted this year was
to take me to get a haircut.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.487
Which means we will go to
a salon, of her choosing,

05:22.489 --> 05:25.791
and she will watch me receive
a haircut, of her choosing.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.693
Moms, gotta love them, right?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.995
I don't love my mom.
I fear her.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.663
Uh-huh. Well,
I gotta go. I'm late.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.933
<i>...and because
of your generous donations,</i>

05:34.935 --> 05:36.468
<i>the read the world foundation</i>

05:36.470 --> 05:39.504
<i>can continue its work
traveling the globe,</i>

05:39.506 --> 05:42.674
<i>and building libraries
in under-developed countries.</i>

05:42.676 --> 05:45.744
<i>This year, we're asking for
your help to raise money</i>

05:45.746 --> 05:47.426
<i>for our trip to Bangladesh,</i>

05:48.481 --> 05:50.549
<i>where we'll spend three months

05:50.551 --> 05:52.351
<i>in the sundarbans.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:57.956
Thank you for the $5.
Great to see you!

05:57.958 --> 05:59.391
Okay, take care. Bye.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.060
So great, start to finish...

06:02.062 --> 06:02.060
I saw you come in late.

06:02.062 --> 06:06.531
I know. I'm sorry. Drunk
Ben Franklin stole a baby.

06:06.533 --> 06:06.531
That old excuse?
I know.

06:06.533 --> 06:13.505
But I would like to make a very
generous donation as an apology.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.875
Ooh! Accepted. Now we only
mostly didn't reach our goal.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.543
Oh, no, is it bad?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.545
Well, we have a big
fundraiser next month,

06:20.547 --> 06:21.813
but we are so far behind.

06:21.815 --> 06:21.813
Well, I guess maybe

06:21.815 --> 06:26.485
you just don't leave your
boyfriend for three months?

06:26.487 --> 06:26.485
Maybe you come with me?

06:26.487 --> 06:30.088
Will you settle for a week
with your folks at the lake?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.557
I can't wait for you to see
it, it's so wonderful there.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.859
And we deserve a break.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.861
Absolutely. Yes.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.631
Is now a bad time to tell you
I'm running for congress?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.003
<i>Hi, Gwennie!</i>

06:45.005 --> 06:47.572
Hi, guys! <i>Hi,
kiddo, how are you?</i>

06:47.574 --> 06:51.643
Ew! Dad, what are you chewing on?
Back away from the camera!

06:51.645 --> 06:51.643
<i>Melon.</i>

06:51.645 --> 06:51.643
<i>What are you packing for?
Come on, get here!</i>

06:51.645 --> 06:57.416
<i>Did you get my email
about packing your own towels?</i>

06:57.418 --> 06:59.618
<i>Because for some reason the only
ones that aren't being used</i>

06:59.620 --> 07:01.086
<i>have these weird stains on them.</i>

07:01.088 --> 07:04.823
- I packed towels.
<i>- Oh! Hi, Roger!</i>

07:04.825 --> 07:04.823
Hey, guys.
<i>Hi!</i>

07:04.825 --> 07:08.894
Guys, Roger is running for congress!
Oh...

07:08.896 --> 07:11.129
<i>Congratulations!</i>

07:11.497 --> 07:11.496
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

07:11.498 --> 07:14.666
<i>Mr. president in the making!
You're the man!</i>

07:14.668 --> 07:14.666
Oh!

07:14.668 --> 07:18.703
I gotta go get the stuff out of the dryer.
I love you guys, I'll see you tomorrow!

07:18.705 --> 07:21.573
No, don't, uh, hang up.
I just got to ask them...

07:21.575 --> 07:24.709
Just about, um... Because
the weather was, uh...

07:24.711 --> 07:27.145
Hey, guys. Um, actually,
when we get up there,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.915
I would love to find a moment
alone with the two of you

07:29.917 --> 07:29.915
to discuss something.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.784
<i>You're going down!</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:32.784
<i>Oh, my god, we're under attack!</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:36.054
<i>Gotta go. Under attack!
Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

07:38.758 --> 07:40.625
<i>That one hit my boob, Todd!</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:43.595
Oh, man, it's a war zone
over there

07:43.796 --> 07:46.198
uh...

07:49.135 --> 07:50.569
Hello.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.804
Who is this?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.509
<i>Tomorrow, you're mine.</i>

08:15.962 --> 08:17.162
Hey, Gwen...
Mmm-hmm.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.664
Your sister's boyfriend Todd

08:19.666 --> 08:21.800
sent me a friend request on Facebook.
Oh. That's nice.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.803
I mean, we haven't
met before, right?

08:24.805 --> 08:24.803
No, because
they live in Colorado

08:24.805 --> 08:29.508
and he wasn't at Thanksgiving because
he had something at the camp.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.043
"The camp"? Yeah, he's a counselor.
You knew that.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.779
I just didn't realize it was
like a year-round thing.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.984
I mean, he seems like a fun guy.

08:40.019 --> 08:44.022
Are you ready for your first political
scandal, Mr. future-congressman?

08:45.992 --> 08:47.926
I love you so much.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.729
No, don't get romantic because then
I'm going to get self-conscious.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.864
Sorry. Keep the fantasy.
Get over here.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.901
Mmm. Scandal me!

09:35.809 --> 09:38.610
Mom! Mom!

09:41.213 --> 09:43.882
What now? Mom, I got a splinter.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.085
Oh! Jesus, Spencer,
that looks awful.

09:47.753 --> 09:47.752
Probably going to scar.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.790
I'm going to get some disinfectant.
Mel, watch them.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.592
Love you too, babe.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.026
Oh! It's so cute!

09:55.028 --> 09:56.728
Are you in love already or what?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.229
I am. I am.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.031
They're here!

10:11.310 --> 10:14.179
Hey, Roger!
How are you?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.880
Good. Good.
So good to see you!

10:16.215 --> 10:16.214
Tell me everything.
What's going on?

10:16.216 --> 10:20.018
Okay. Well, aunt Pam is
going through menopause...

10:20.820 --> 10:22.954
Roger!
Hi, Roger.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.724
How are you? Very good.
Very happy to be here.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.993
So are we, hon. And
dinner's almost ready.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.160
Oh! You're not
a vegetarian, are you?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.328
Oh! No.
Okay, good.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.263
Because look at this beast.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.165
It looks so good I could nut!

10:34.167 --> 10:35.233
Right.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.873
Did your mom just
say, "I could nut"?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.943
Yeah. It's her fun spin
on "I'm going nuts."

10:44.945 --> 10:47.012
She's said it
since we were kids.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.947
Don't worry, she doesn't
mean it the other way.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.348
Ugh!

10:50.350 --> 10:53.852
Great. I have lake hair. I
just threw on this sweatshirt.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.923
I look freakish. I didn't realize
I'd be meeting him like this, Gwen.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.192
You look great to me.
Okay, well, that's a lie.

11:01.827 --> 11:01.826
I'm Pam.
Hi. Roger.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.863
Of course he's lying,
he's a politician.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.999
Gwen. What are you doing
with all my taxes?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.769
Just lining the pockets
of corporate America.

11:10.771 --> 11:15.173
Oh, yeah? More like...
Should be cargo pants.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.812
I'm sorry?
You said "pockets"...

11:20.814 --> 11:23.782
I thought... A lot of...
I'm Mel.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.383
Hey. Roger.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.119
Hey, little man.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.988
What is wrong with you?
He got a splinter, guy!

11:29.990 --> 11:31.756
I'm so sorry. Come on,
honey, let's go inside.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.125
- He's only 11, guy.
- I mean, really!

11:34.127 --> 11:37.362
I didn't see the splinter. I thought
he was going for like a low five...

11:40.833 --> 11:42.067
I thought he was
going for a low five.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.735
So did I.
Should I go in there?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.904
No. No. No. Give them
a moment to cool down.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.907
Because Mel and Pam are kind of
angry people. They're hateful.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.076
No way!

11:51.844 --> 11:53.411
He's here!

11:53.413 --> 11:55.046
He's here!

11:55.048 --> 11:57.382
Don't leave!
I'm coming!

11:57.384 --> 11:58.817
Oh, yeah!

11:58.819 --> 12:01.186
Hey, man.
He's here! Whoo!

12:03.089 --> 12:05.490
Watch your feet,
you've got open toes on.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.459
Hey, buddy, I'm Roger.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.895
Yes! I knew it!

12:10.897 --> 12:12.330
I'm so happy you're here!

12:12.865 --> 12:12.864
Hi, Gwen.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.201
Thank you for bringing me
a new toy to play with.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.268
Okay!

12:18.003 --> 12:20.105
Man, I'm so happy you're here!

12:20.107 --> 12:22.073
I'm doing it again!
I know. Just go easy.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.942
Sorry. They haven't
even unpacked yet.

12:23.944 --> 12:23.942
On it.

12:23.944 --> 12:29.414
You, with me. We carry heavy
things, for this is man's work.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.118
It's Tim Allen.
<i>Home improvement?</i>

12:33.120 --> 12:35.820
Oh! Sure. "I don't
think so, Tim."

12:36.989 --> 12:39.491
You're my Al.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.828
Let's do this. Come on!
Great show.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.964
Oh, yeah!

12:46.932 --> 12:48.366
Hey, did you get
my friend request?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.434
Yeah.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.302
I noticed you didn't accept it.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.139
Oh, yeah. I haven't
really had a chance.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.840
You got time now.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.442
Yeah. Can we
unpack first?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.811
Totally.
I love unpacking.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.282
Oh, man, it's just so good to finally
meet you, you know. I got that.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.117
How long have you and Gwen
been together now?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.218
Uh. Almost two years.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.420
Two years!
Oh, wow!

13:09.955 --> 13:11.890
And at last we are united.

13:12.091 --> 13:12.090
Good things take time, I guess.
I got that.

13:12.092 --> 13:17.295
Sorry. I should know, man. I've been
dating Margie for what, five years now?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.531
Still don't see a ring on it.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.372
Hey, man, just don't beat me
to the proposal punch. Okay?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.336
Because I got seniority.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.939
And it'll make me
look <i>Nada</i> so good.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.508
Spanish.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.911
You speak Spanish?
It was. Yeah.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.946
And then I went like that...
For the sombrero.

13:35.347 --> 13:35.346
Yeah.

13:35.348 --> 13:39.050
Don't get me wrong. Margie
is most def the one.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.020
Them Turley girls, they yummy.

13:42.922 --> 13:42.921
They're lovely women.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.824
I just want to do
it right, you know?

13:46.325 --> 13:49.460
I think everybody has to propose
when it feels best for them.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.830
Beautiful.
I'll dap on that.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.833
Whoa!

13:54.835 --> 13:57.035
No, man. Dap it.
I'm a dapper.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.305
Pew, pew!
Oh!

14:00.439 --> 14:02.507
You got me.
Shot you in the face.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.975
Would never do it.
Would never do it.

14:03.977 --> 14:03.975
Hey, let me grab that for you.
No, I got it.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.879
No, let me grab it.
Okay. Thank you.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.949
Okay, everyone, meat's ready!

14:10.951 --> 14:12.183
Whoa!

14:12.185 --> 14:15.086
Look at this. Honey, it's so good.
Beautiful!

14:15.254 --> 14:17.188
Salt and pepper.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.959
Dibs on the seat next to Roger!

14:21.493 --> 14:23.895
It's only a week.
It's only a week.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.430
Baby Gwen!

14:25.432 --> 14:27.065
Oh! Don't look
at that. Oh, god!

14:27.399 --> 14:28.900
No!

14:28.902 --> 14:31.236
You're so cute though,
I want to kiss it.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.204
Hey, Rog.
Hey, Jerry. Great.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.074
Oh! I see you found
the wall of Gill.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.443
Oh, yeah, Gill is the fish.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.211
Oh! Largest trout in the lake.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.314
He's kind of an unofficial
town mascot, too. Oh!

14:43.316 --> 14:45.250
Everybody in the family's
caught him. Look.

14:45.252 --> 14:49.354
There's Melster
and Todd. Pam.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.089
He's gigantic!
Yeah.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.157
I mean, he's like
the size of a small...

14:54.026 --> 14:55.894
'84 Olympics.
Is that you?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.528
Mmm-hmm.
Looking good, Jerry.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.032
Almost medaled but
the French beat us.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.333
Ah.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.270
They were kind of so
smug about it, too.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.139
They started kissing their
medals in front of me. Uh...

15:09.541 --> 15:11.142
You aren't French, are you?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.144
No, sir.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.046
Attaboy.
Yeah.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.348
Hey, let's eat.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.024
Check this out.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.963
I also prefer to
eat my dessert first.

15:32.564 --> 15:36.034
No, actually, grandma Hibby
has severe sciatica. Oh.

15:36.036 --> 15:40.204
So I put together a completely
legal "herbal" snack pack.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.540
Special candy bars and
chips and stuff, you know.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.410
All with a little THC,
a little...

15:45.611 --> 15:47.178
You feeling good, Hibby?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.413
Flyin'.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.149
I saw her talking to an
old boot the other day.

15:51.317 --> 15:51.316
Nah, I'm just kidding.

15:51.318 --> 15:55.219
Gwen, how'd you meet
the high-five king?

15:55.454 --> 15:58.456
It was new year's Eve. Neither
one of us had anyone to kiss.

15:58.624 --> 16:03.962
So I told him if we started at 11:59, our
first kiss would last for two years.

16:04.296 --> 16:04.295
How could I say no?

16:04.297 --> 16:08.533
Yeah, but it wasn't a two-year kiss,
it was probably like a minute.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.637
Hey, everybody,
can I have the floor?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.305
Uh...

16:14.307 --> 16:19.110
Being the baby in a family
of six sisters, you know,

16:19.112 --> 16:19.110
I've always wanted a brother.

16:19.112 --> 16:24.082
I guess I was a good boy, because
my wish finally came true.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.151
Roger rabbit over here.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.387
<i>Uno</i> more thing, sir.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.023
Rich Spanish guy, um...

16:32.257 --> 16:33.658
I actually have some big news.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.260
Margie's pregnant. I told
you she was showing.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.029
No, Pam.
I'm not pregnant.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.131
No. Guys, I'm leaving
my job at the camp.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.200
What? But it's for
a good reason.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.203
I'm going to be taking
a higher paying gig

16:45.205 --> 16:48.239
as a program director
at the new youth center...

16:49.341 --> 16:51.142
In Seattle!

16:51.510 --> 16:54.412
What? Are you moving
to Seattle?

16:54.414 --> 16:58.549
Yes. It was so hard
not to say anything.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.220
You're dead to me.
You're dead to me.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.688
Get used to seeing
this face, sir.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.090
Because you are going to
be seeing it all the time!

17:07.093 --> 17:08.526
All the time!

17:08.528 --> 17:11.529
All the time!
Everybody!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.297
All the time!

17:13.299 --> 17:14.632
All the time!

17:15.467 --> 17:18.269
So, you guys are in this cabin.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.304
And that one is
Todd and Margie's.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.986
You know, I forgot my satchel back
in the house, I'll be right back.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.176
Did he just say "satchel"?
Unfortunately, yes.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.179
Ooh!

17:28.580 --> 17:30.481
Oh, no.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.317
My god. Look,
they're so cute.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.186
Oh! I want to hold
them close to my face.

17:35.188 --> 17:35.186
No, you do not.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.289
You know that their sacks
are primed to spray

17:38.291 --> 17:39.557
and that scent can
linger for months!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.492
Todd, go get a box
and some syrup.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.228
Got it. Look at the little one.
He's my friend.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.530
Ooh!
His name's Langdon.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.165
No. Don't name them.
Don't get attached.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.300
I'm not naming them.
That is his name.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.402
I'm sensing it.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.670
Oh, no, it's the mom.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.706
Nobody. Move.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.643
Got the satchel!

18:04.683 --> 18:08.286
Okay, on three. Jerry, I'm
standing right here, buddy.

18:08.620 --> 18:08.619
Cathy, I am so sorry.

18:08.621 --> 18:12.557
I will pay for whatever cleaning
service you need for the cabin...

18:12.559 --> 18:15.626
Oh! Stop it, please. That thing
needed renovating anyway.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.395
- Luckily, we have two.
- Look!

18:17.397 --> 18:19.330
- Dream phone!
- Oh, my god.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.665
Does that thing still work?

18:20.667 --> 18:20.665
You tell me.

18:20.667 --> 18:25.336
- Phone call.
<i>- I think your face is cute.</i>

18:25.671 --> 18:27.338
Well, your room is all set.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.507
And if you need anything,
you know where to find us.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.242
Thank you so much. Yeah.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.377
Actually, uh, Cathy, sorry.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.746
I would love to find that moment
alone with you and Jerry,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.815
sometime tomorrow, maybe
just the three of us.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.651
Oh! Absolutely. Jerry and I
always go for a morning hike.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.720
Oh! That's great. Consider
me your co-hiker.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.123
It's early.
7:00 A.M. sharp.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.358
That's okay. I am an early bird.
I will be there.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.361
All right, I can't wait.
I'm gonna nut! Me too.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.299
7:00 A.M.!
7:00 A.M.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.635
Nutting.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.172
Welcome to the free hostel.

19:01.609 --> 19:02.508
It's Todd.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.144
Yeah, I recognized you from
the denim pajama pants.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.247
Mmm. Thank you,
they're pa-Jean-as! Ooh!

19:09.249 --> 19:12.283
I see you brought the camping
essentials of wig and funny glasses.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.886
Wrong-o. I brought
a bunch of them.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.822
Behold the wig museum.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.459
Seriously though, they're communal. So,
feel free to take whatever you want.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.294
I highly suggest raptor head.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.830
Oh! Thank goodness, because I
left my raptor head at home.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.598
You have a raptor head at home?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.271
Shut it down.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.839
You got me, bro.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.841
Gwen, I think we're
going to keep this one.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.379
Let me get that for you,
clear a little space.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.248
Sorry. It's my
white noise machine.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.650
Need this bad boy to sleep.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.319
My roommate had one of those.
She played forest sounds.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.454
Oh, nice.
I use casino floor.

19:50.724 --> 19:51.623
"Casino floor"?

19:51.624 --> 19:55.860
Yeah. I grew up in Reno. My
mom was a Blackjack dealer,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.596
so I spent a lot
of time at casinees.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.398
The sounds are just
soothing to me I guess.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.699
I hated it when he first
started staying over,

20:01.701 --> 20:02.900
but now I can't
sleep without it.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.302
Yeah.

20:04.304 --> 20:04.302
Oh. Is this going to bother you?
I didn't even think of asking.

20:04.304 --> 20:10.708
I'm a heavy sleeper, so I'm fine,
but did you bring earplugs?

20:11.510 --> 20:12.777
I did not.

20:12.779 --> 20:12.777
Rog-Mahal,
trust me.

20:12.779 --> 20:16.447
This thing is going to
conk your butt right out!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.685
Need I say more?

20:38.503 --> 20:39.637
<i>No more bets.</i>

20:42.474 --> 20:43.808
Mommy!

21:10.535 --> 21:12.570
No!

21:16.742 --> 21:18.702
...flying home, 'cause I
got a text on my pager...

21:21.446 --> 21:22.847
...oh, this is not
my mess.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.650
- It was so his mess!
- It was so his mess!

21:25.784 --> 21:25.783
Hey, Roger!

21:25.785 --> 21:28.719
- I slept in.
- Don't worry about it.

21:28.721 --> 21:28.719
You're on vacation.
Not a problem.

21:28.721 --> 21:34.292
I'm so sorry. I just... I had a hard
time falling asleep last night.

21:34.559 --> 21:37.428
Oh, Rog, if you want to switch beds,
man, you just let me know. Okay?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.697
Aw, beautiful.
Hey, Rog...

21:43.569 --> 21:45.836
I got the squirrel bite
on my nuts to prove it.

21:45.838 --> 21:46.937
Oh! Oh!

21:46.939 --> 21:48.873
That's why the walks are fun.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.609
I'm gonna go check on Margie.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.479
I feel awful that
I missed this hike,

21:54.480 --> 21:58.916
just because it would have been
a better setting than this.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.418
I want to talk to you
about something important...

22:00.420 --> 22:01.686
Good morning, Turleys!

22:02.387 --> 22:02.386
Good morning!

22:02.388 --> 22:06.724
Miesha! This is Gwen's
boyfriend, Roger.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.493
Welcome.
Magic is real.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.463
And it lives right here.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.800
You know, Miesha lives
here all year long

22:15.802 --> 22:17.935
and he takes care of the
place when we're gone.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.036
And that's Laerke.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.905
It's a pleasure
to meet both of you.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.341
And that's a lovely
painting, Laerke.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.509
Oh, Laerke speaks no English.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.045
But I will relay your kindness.
Please believe me.

22:28.947 --> 22:28.946
Have a good one!

22:28.948 --> 22:31.816
What were you saying?
He interrupted.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.685
Well, yeah, actually,
if you're free right now

22:34.687 --> 22:36.354
I'd love to take
you out to breakfast.

22:36.356 --> 22:39.757
You guys want waffles
or French toast?

22:40.525 --> 22:42.793
Oh! You've got to try
his legendary French toast.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.429
Jer, can I put you
on the crumble topping?

22:45.831 --> 22:47.565
I've been summoned.

22:47.567 --> 22:51.869
Hey, listen, don't worry about it.
We'll find some time. We have all day.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.605
Sure, totally. No, I just would
love to find a moment...

22:54.607 --> 22:57.408
Because it's important.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.460
Whoa! Mel magic!

23:42.554 --> 23:44.622
Good morning.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.558
I made you breakfast in bed.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.596
Oh! Oh!
Oh!

23:52.731 --> 23:54.498
Roger? Oh!
Yeah.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.534
I am so sorry.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.436
I saw someone standing over us.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.671
I didn't mean to throw
<i>shogun</i> at your face.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.974
Oh. That's okay. It's paperback.
Come on. Are you okay, honey?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.143
I didn't mean to scare you,
I just literally don't think

24:06.145 --> 24:08.546
there will be another moment for
the three of us to be alone.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.648
But I'll keep it brief.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.049
Okay.

24:13.819 --> 24:15.853
I love your daughter.

24:15.855 --> 24:20.991
I think she is the most
extraordinary, strong, intelligent,

24:20.993 --> 24:22.126
fun person I know,

24:22.128 --> 24:24.462
and I live to make her happy.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.631
So, I wanted to ask you two

24:27.633 --> 24:30.968
for your blessing
to ask her to marry me.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.707
Of course, yes.
Of course, honey.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.042
That means a lot.

24:38.044 --> 24:41.879
I would be misty right now, but I
really can't get my eyes open.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.748
Okay, I'm going to get out of your hair.
You guys get back to sleep.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.485
Oh, uh, and if you wouldn't
mind keeping it under wraps,

24:47.487 --> 24:49.753
because I have a whole thing planned,
so maybe don't say anything.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.055
Our lips are zipped, Rog.

24:51.057 --> 24:54.091
Okay, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.660
Get some sleep.
Sweet dreams.

24:57.963 --> 24:58.963
Oh.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.566
I got your book...
Oh, my god!

25:04.136 --> 25:06.937
Roger, you have to knock!

25:06.939 --> 25:08.839
Yeah. God,
that was so fast.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.875
That's how we do
it in this family.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.752
Oh! Hubba Hubba!
Where you going?

25:21.754 --> 25:23.888
I'm going swimming.
You want to come?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.623
I do. Let me grab
my trunks.

25:26.558 --> 25:27.925
Why are you in such a good mood?

25:27.927 --> 25:27.925
I'm on vacation.

25:27.927 --> 25:32.930
And when I'm on vacation, I, uh,
kind of turn into Dr. happy.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.966
Do you also turn into an idiot?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.868
Okay, well, that's your opinion.

25:38.703 --> 25:43.107
Hey, what do you think about you
and me going on a date this week?

25:43.708 --> 25:45.142
When was the last time
we went on a date?

25:45.144 --> 25:47.711
Yeah. That's what
I'm saying.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.781
So, how about Thursday

25:50.783 --> 25:53.617
I take you out for
the night of your life?

25:53.619 --> 25:55.252
All right.
I think I like Dr. happy.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.954
I mean, he's kind of
the best, right?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.756
And he's a doctor so
you've got to trust him.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.026
You know what's the worst though?
What?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.894
Whatever those are on your feet.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.196
They're my aqua-toesies.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.932
That's a deal-breaker
as hell!

26:07.934 --> 26:07.932
They're sleek, what are
you talking about?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.834
They're for balance and traction.
They're hideous.

26:10.836 --> 26:11.969
I don't know what's at
the bottom of that lake.

26:11.971 --> 26:11.969
They're useless.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.205
Yeah, and you can't push me over
because I'm sturdy as heck.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.941
Yes, I can.
Super grip!

26:16.943 --> 26:16.941
Here, feel the super
grip on the bottom.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.911
No, don't put those near me.
Feel the super grip.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.682
That feels terrible. No. No.
Here, just try them on.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.184
Kiss my toesies. No! I'm
not gonna kiss your...

26:31.856 --> 26:35.659
Daddy, what're you
doing to mommy?

26:37.729 --> 26:39.797
Ohh.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.665
Hi, Todd.
Hey.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.869
Sorry to interrupt. Roy Rogers,
you've got a phone call.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.037
Whoa!

26:48.673 --> 26:50.274
To be continued.
Okay.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.080
I can smell it
through my mask, dude.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.916
Get right down those edges.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.854
Oh. This smells like
this inside of a butt.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.995
Hello? <i>Ah! You're a
hard man to reach.</i>

27:10.997 --> 27:12.863
Hey, yes, sorry.
Reception sucks up here.

27:12.865 --> 27:13.998
What's going on?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.934
Bit of a crisis.
It got out.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.903
What got out?
<i>Frank's retirement.</i>

27:19.905 --> 27:19.903
His daughter
freaking tweeted it.

27:19.905 --> 27:23.807
And now I'm getting phone calls
asking if frank is dying.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.309
Okay. I'll call frank
right now.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.277
<i>I just talked to him,
he's getting on a plane.</i>

27:27.279 --> 27:28.846
But he wants to call you
today or tomorrow.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.148
Can I give him this phone number?
Yes. Yes, please.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.984
Did he sound upset? No. He
was actually pretty chill.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.687
You know, I like about-to-retire frank.
He doesn't give a...

27:36.689 --> 27:37.988
Anwar!

27:39.057 --> 27:40.791
Yes, mother?

27:40.793 --> 27:43.727
That's gutter language!
You are an educated man.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.029
Not a gangbanger.

27:45.031 --> 27:45.029
"Gangbanger"?

27:45.031 --> 27:45.029
<i>What, are you listening to NPR?</i>

27:45.031 --> 27:51.001
Sounds like you're getting the haircut.
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah.</i>

27:51.003 --> 27:51.001
It's her birthday.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.972
Which is why none of the
birds are singing today.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.142
<i>How are things over there?</i>
Great. Great. Yeah.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.878
Gwen's family
is fantastic. Um...

28:02.047 --> 28:05.182
Her sister's boyfriend
is a little...

28:05.984 --> 28:05.983
A little what?

28:05.985 --> 28:10.988
Well, right now he has a
face painted on his belly.

28:10.990 --> 28:14.324
He's laughing hysterically
and he's all by himself.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.261
Wow. You really
hate this guy.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.830
Yeah, but, uh, keep me updated.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.398
And tell your
mother I say hello.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
I will not do that.
Thank you.

28:25.804 --> 28:29.206
In the back, do you want
it straight across or a v?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.308
Let's go with a v.
Straight across!

28:32.844 --> 28:33.844
Straight across...

28:34.179 --> 28:36.780
No. It's my head.

28:37.882 --> 28:41.351
V? No... I guess... Let's
go straight across.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.187
That's fine.

28:43.354 --> 28:44.922
Do it! Do it!

28:48.426 --> 28:51.428
Hi, Roger!
Come on in!

28:51.896 --> 28:53.497
Isn't this the life?

28:59.104 --> 29:01.505
You get a chance to accept
my friend request yet?

29:02.006 --> 29:05.809
No. Not yet. I'm actually just
doing a little work here.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.344
Understood.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.815
Hey, can I talk to
you about something?

29:13.785 --> 29:16.053
I thought you weren't
gonna propose before me.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.790
And I heard that you were thinking
about asking Gwen, and I just...

29:20.191 --> 29:22.025
Got confused, I guess.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.128
Where did you hear that?
On the roof.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.030
I was up there
watching the sunrise

29:27.032 --> 29:28.899
and I heard something
through the window.

29:29.934 --> 29:29.933
I'm a curious little monkey.

29:29.935 --> 29:35.472
Listen, Todd, I've had this proposal
planned since before I even met you.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.342
So, I am gonna do it.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.344
Yeah. I get it.
Yeah.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.414
I just have a really fun idea
that I think you'd like.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.451
Hear me out. What about
a dual proposal?

29:48.119 --> 29:51.155
We could even like, make a
suit with two heads in it...

29:51.157 --> 29:53.490
We could be like one
person but with two heads.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.392
Uh...

29:55.894 --> 29:57.361
No.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.930
Just because it's
kind of a whole thing.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.232
I planned for us to
go horseback riding,

30:02.234 --> 30:05.903
a sunset picnic with champagne
on her favorite bluff

30:05.905 --> 30:07.237
where she used
to hike to as a kid.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.206
What's a bluff? It's
kind of like a cliff.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.507
You can kind of
see it from there.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.410
You could just call it a cliff.
You know...

30:13.412 --> 30:17.514
I even hired a caterer to have a
dessert reception for the family.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.150
There's going to be
vintage port, so... Mmm.

30:20.885 --> 30:25.222
Sounds classy as fug.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.358
I could go halvsies?

30:28.360 --> 30:28.358
That's not going to work,

30:28.360 --> 30:34.031
because it's very, very specifically
designed to Gwen and I.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.866
You know, she's leaving soon,

30:35.868 --> 30:37.301
so I would really like it
to go as planned.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.069
I get it.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.238
You just want to get married
to her before she gets away.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.372
I got it.

30:47.245 --> 30:51.114
I just figured since we were gonna
spend the rest of our lives together,

30:51.116 --> 30:53.183
that we could propose
to our girls together.

30:54.285 --> 30:58.155
What do you mean, we're spending
the rest of our lives together?

30:58.157 --> 31:01.625
Look at them, man,
they're inseparable.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.527
And when we move
next to each other

31:03.529 --> 31:05.195
they're going to be
even more inseparable.

31:05.197 --> 31:09.032
We're gonna to be doing
everything together.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.468
We're gonna be
brother-in-laws.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.037
Brothers-in-law.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.906
"Brothers" is plural.
It's one "law".

31:16.174 --> 31:19.076
Exactly.
We are brothers now.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.211
Technically,
we're not even that yet.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.113
Tell that to my heart.

31:24.282 --> 31:26.250
Oh, my god.
I can't wait.

31:30.488 --> 31:31.889
Ooh!

31:31.891 --> 31:34.458
My lady, I lick you very much.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.268
Stop, you're getting it
on the goatee.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.922
Belly Bob Thornton!
When did you get here?

32:04.924 --> 32:08.191
Can I get some French fry potatoes?
Mmm-hmm.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.528
Give me a kiss, Roger.

32:12.196 --> 32:13.497
Give me a kiss.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.399
No, thank you.
I'm spoken for.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.068
Give me a kiss, Roger.

32:18.070 --> 32:18.969
I'll blow you one.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.637
You'll blow me?

32:20.973 --> 32:25.943
Belly Bob Thornton
want a kiss from you.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.046
You kissed
my belly! Ew!

32:32.450 --> 32:37.621
You know, I'm glad we can all laugh
about this because as we all know

32:37.623 --> 32:42.392
this lake was the site
of a horrific tragedy.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.428
Todd, if you talk
about scary stuff

32:44.430 --> 32:46.229
I'm going to have
nightmares and I'm leaving.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.664
Fraidy cat!
Meow.

32:48.366 --> 32:52.102
What was it,
13, 14 years ago now?

32:52.370 --> 32:52.369
What happened?

32:52.371 --> 32:56.540
A whole family was murdered
right here on this lake.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.409
By a crazy person
with a chainsaw.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.545
One by one in the dark.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.313
That is not true.
Stop.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.515
It is true, Pam.
Bing it.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.117
I'm not going to Bing it.

33:07.119 --> 33:10.721
And the scary thing is,
they never found the guy.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.991
Last thing I heard, they
found him hiding under a...

33:18.463 --> 33:20.063
Did you hear that?

33:21.099 --> 33:22.532
Hibby, you heard that, right?

33:23.134 --> 33:25.235
I'm going to go check this out.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.174
Spencer, maybe you
should go with him?

33:31.176 --> 33:32.309
No way!

33:32.311 --> 33:33.377
Go on. Go.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.779
No! Please!

33:39.250 --> 33:40.650
Help me.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.023
I loved you.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.630
Todd, that is even better
than last year!

33:54.465 --> 33:56.066
He got blood on my sweater.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.449
Roger! Roger,
stop! It's me!

34:12.451 --> 34:13.683
It's me. Margie.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.186
Dude. We got you!

34:17.656 --> 34:19.755
He screamed so high.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.228
Oh. Spencer.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.130
You broke a table with my son.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.670
So, how's little Spencer doing?

34:34.172 --> 34:35.472
He's got a really bad sprain.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.774
Pam's putting a bandage
on him right now.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.609
What a putz!

34:42.481 --> 34:45.482
Now, your entire family
hates me.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.819
Spencer does hate you, but
he has a pretty good reason.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.656
I'm pretty sure
Cody hates me, too.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.690
Wow, he's giving you the double.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.094
Todd did that to make
me look like an idiot.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.296
But that wasn't just for you.
That was for everybody.

34:59.298 --> 35:02.299
No, he said... remember,
he said, "we got you."

35:02.600 --> 35:05.335
Because he did. Because you
screamed like a little girl.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.737
No, he's trying
to get back at me.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.275
For what?

35:12.277 --> 35:13.543
I don't know what.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.146
He's been combative with me
since we got here.

35:16.148 --> 35:19.716
Todd is a lot of things, but
combative is not one of them.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.352
You got to relax.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.454
Remember, that's why
we came up here.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.259
That, and so you could bond with
my family, but you've tanked that.

35:29.261 --> 35:33.330
I'm trying to be... It's a joke, Roger.
It's a joke.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.466
Hey,

35:38.269 --> 35:40.403
why don't you come with me?

35:40.405 --> 35:41.505
Where are we going?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.707
I'm going to take you
to a pet cemetery.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.408
Come on, you big puss.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.312
Can you see where
you're stepping?

35:49.314 --> 35:51.481
Shh. Why don't you
just relax?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.683
You might actually have
a really good time.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.486
What does that mean?

35:56.687 --> 35:58.722
I think you'll
find out soon enough.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.657
Oh! There's mud here.
Be careful.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.861
What am I gonna... Oh. This mud?
Yeah, found it.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.730
It's the sticky kind.

36:08.599 --> 36:09.733
Gwen?

36:11.602 --> 36:12.769
Gwen?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.505
Where did you go?

36:20.845 --> 36:22.379
Gwen?

36:24.248 --> 36:25.549
What are you doing?

36:25.551 --> 36:27.417
What do you think I'm doing?

36:29.253 --> 36:30.854
Come on in, you creep.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.661
Roger.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.664
Come out and play.

36:41.632 --> 36:42.799
Faster.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.302
Here I come.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.218
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it!

37:01.519 --> 37:02.519
Stop fighting!

37:02.887 --> 37:05.288
This is why we don't have
candy for breakfast.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.834
Maybe today we give each other
a little breathing room.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.302
What do you think?

37:19.503 --> 37:20.837
Let's go. Let's go.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.844
Hey there, early bird. Hey, you.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.915
Hey. Morning.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.251
Hey, dad. You going to
go catch us some dinner?

37:34.253 --> 37:36.953
No. I'm just going to throw a
couple of lines out from the dock.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.555
Catch and release, you know.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.724
Roger, you want to join me?
Um...

37:41.292 --> 37:43.393
Yeah. I've never
done it before.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.662
Oh! It's a blast.
I'll show you the ropes.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.997
Great. Let me
get changed.

37:54.672 --> 37:57.340
Come on, Gill.
Where are you?

37:59.944 --> 38:01.344
Hey, gentlemen.

38:01.346 --> 38:03.446
Hey.
Is this seat taken?

38:03.448 --> 38:06.349
No. Just for you.
No, Rog. Join us.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.885
Grab that pole.
Thank you, Jer.

38:09.987 --> 38:12.489
Thanks so much, Jerry.
This is the life.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.425
I'm glad you guys could make it.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.826
Both of you.

38:16.828 --> 38:22.365
It's kind of a tricky thing, a father
meets his daughter's boyfriends.

38:23.434 --> 38:25.835
You know, after all, you're
sexing up my little girls.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.405
What? No, me and Margie
just hold hands.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.440
Nice try. Roger?

38:30.941 --> 38:32.309
Oh, I...

38:32.443 --> 38:35.745
I promise, I'm the
most respectful, um...

38:35.747 --> 38:37.814
Hey, godspeed.

38:38.582 --> 38:38.581
Because at a certain moment

38:38.583 --> 38:43.653
you got to just trust that you've
raised your kids to have good taste.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.855
And I think mine do.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.758
I really appreciate that, Jerry.
It means a lot.

38:48.760 --> 38:48.758
Choosing who to
share your life with,

38:48.760 --> 38:53.463
that's the most important decision
you'll ever make in your whole lives.

38:53.465 --> 38:57.334
I remember me, it was
after the '84 Olympics,

38:57.336 --> 39:01.905
I flipped this super-charged golf cart
and completely destroyed my shoulder.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.840
Cath came down to the hospital.

39:04.475 --> 39:05.909
I said, "what now?"

39:05.911 --> 39:09.679
She said,
"we'll figure it out."

39:10.948 --> 39:13.817
And then, right there,
in the hospital...

39:15.519 --> 39:16.986
She tugged it.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.489
Yeah.

39:21.892 --> 39:22.959
That's beautiful.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.830
Your father is probably telling
the hospital tugged-it story.

39:26.832 --> 39:29.666
I love that story.
It's so romantic.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.035
Yeah, it's a beautiful story.
Now the left side.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.772
It just stinks that you're
gonna be gone for three months

39:35.774 --> 39:37.507
the second I move to Seattle.

39:37.509 --> 39:38.908
It'll be over
before you know it.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.578
Hey, honey, where are you
going again? Bulgaria?

39:41.580 --> 39:41.578
Bangladesh.

39:41.580 --> 39:45.715
Oh! Bangladesh is gorgeous
in the summertime.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.051
You must avoid eating
the Dolpudi fish though.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.586
It causes insanity.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.755
And circle the hips.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.023
Wow. Gwen, you know,
if Roger gets elected,

39:54.025 --> 39:55.658
you're gonna be
dating a public figure.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.060
That's a lot of pressure.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.962
You know, when Todd
was head camp counselor

39:58.964 --> 40:01.531
I had to share the spotlight
with him, it was so hard on us.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.866
We almost broke up.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.667
And now squat position.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.536
Use your Bo for balance.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.139
I don't know. We haven't
even really talked about it.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.108
What does a congressman's
girlfriend do?

40:12.110 --> 40:14.577
All right. Are we all
loose and ready?

40:14.579 --> 40:15.445
Yeah.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.913
Begin!

40:21.952 --> 40:23.553
Well, guess what, guys?

40:23.555 --> 40:27.557
I had these two beers,
and now I've got to pee.

40:28.926 --> 40:29.993
Need anything?
Anybody?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.861
I'm good. I'll take a hot milk.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.029
Thank you.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.912
You know, I didn't get
a lot of this growing up.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.769
Fishing?
No. Guy time.

40:40.104 --> 40:44.574
With six sisters, you'd think I'd get at
least a boyfriend or a brother-in-law.

40:45.643 --> 40:49.579
But, alas, all lesbians.

40:51.982 --> 40:54.050
All six of your
sisters are lesbians?

40:54.052 --> 40:59.189
Indeed. But I got my
little bros at camp. So...

40:59.657 --> 41:01.090
They keep me going.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.059
Check this out.
That's Oscar.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.894
He's got like
a really sucky home life.

41:04.896 --> 41:04.894
But he's an amazing artist.

41:04.896 --> 41:09.899
I told him if he drew me a picture
every day for the whole summer

41:09.901 --> 41:11.734
I would get him
off of cleaning duty.

41:11.736 --> 41:14.003
By the end of the summer
he had a whole portfolio.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.872
Now, he's going to art
school on a scholarship.

41:15.874 --> 41:15.872
Wow.
Yeah.

41:15.874 --> 41:19.809
He drew that for me.
Isn't that amazing? Oh!

41:19.811 --> 41:19.809
That's great.
That's you?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.745
Yeah. He got the neck
just right.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.515
Looks just like it.
Yeah. That's incredible.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.616
Are those grenades?
Yeah.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.619
I have a grenade
collection at home.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.488
So he's just working from
real life, he's amazing.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.689
He made me a superhero.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.024
Busting through a wall
like the Kool-aid man.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.560
"Oh, yeah!"

41:39.964 --> 41:41.731
More precious than gold.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.969
Todd, that's... oh.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.170
Oh!

41:47.905 --> 41:49.506
Here we go. I think
I caught a fish!

41:49.508 --> 41:51.641
Yeah, you did.
Okay. So what do I do?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.576
Reel that bitch in. Come on.
Just keep turning?

41:53.578 --> 41:57.080
Yeah. Just reel it for three seconds
then pull real hard to set the hook.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.648
Reel, reel, reel.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.149
Pull.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.520
Reel... oh, boy.
Oh, man!

42:03.721 --> 42:05.522
That is a big one, huh?

42:06.790 --> 42:08.725
Oh! No way.

42:08.926 --> 42:11.694
That stripe...
Gill! That's Gill!

42:11.696 --> 42:13.062
That's Gill?
You caught Gill!

42:13.064 --> 42:14.197
I caught Gill!

42:14.199 --> 42:15.965
Jerry!
Roger got Gill!

42:15.967 --> 42:18.268
I got Gill! All right.
I'll get everybody.

42:18.836 --> 42:20.603
Oh! There he is!
There he is!

42:20.605 --> 42:22.605
Okay, I got it.

42:30.681 --> 42:32.015
Yes, it's Gill!

42:32.716 --> 42:34.884
You put on some pounds,
you big fat bastard.

42:35.686 --> 42:36.886
Good job, honey.

42:38.088 --> 42:39.556
I'm so proud of you.

42:39.558 --> 42:42.158
Gilly boy, good to see you.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.229
Good job, Roger!
Thanks, buddy.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.630
Triumphant smile.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.699
It's going on the wall!

42:51.835 --> 42:53.836
All right, now we've
got to put him back.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.271
Okay, so I just...
Pull the hook out?

42:55.273 --> 42:57.974
Yeah. Take the hook out
and send him home.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.109
Okay. He's not going to bite me, right?
You got it, man.

43:00.111 --> 43:03.146
No. Come on, Rog, just grab it.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.782
Yeah, come on, just
pull back real hard.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.584
You just got to
finesse it a little bit.

43:07.586 --> 43:09.719
Let's go. Take it out.
Take it out.

43:09.721 --> 43:09.719
It's stuck in there really good.

43:09.721 --> 43:13.222
Okay, man, you just got to give it a
quick up-shimmy and then pull back.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.257
What is an
up-shimmy?

43:14.259 --> 43:15.892
Up-shimmy,
it's an up-shimmy...

43:15.894 --> 43:17.193
Down, and then
up-shimmy!

43:17.195 --> 43:18.861
Up-shimmy, Roger.
Up-shimmy.

43:18.863 --> 43:20.863
It's stuck on a bone.
Roger, please...

43:20.865 --> 43:22.999
You please! You please!
You're killing him!

43:23.601 --> 43:23.600
Take it out!

43:23.602 --> 43:26.869
Just give it an up-shimmy and
then pull it as hard as you can!

43:26.871 --> 43:28.605
I am up-shimmying!

43:50.729 --> 43:52.095
Oh! Oh! Oh!

43:52.696 --> 43:55.098
Stop it! We can
stop the bleeding!

43:55.299 --> 43:58.301
We can save...
He's okay. He's okay!

43:59.904 --> 44:01.404
He's gonna be fine.

44:01.907 --> 44:02.806
Gill...

44:02.807 --> 44:07.710
Please, will you just kick
that into the water. Please.

44:08.278 --> 44:11.648
It's on my foot.
I can't...

44:12.716 --> 44:14.250
I'm going to expel.

44:14.252 --> 44:15.785
Out of my way!

44:15.787 --> 44:17.854
Here, here, here!

44:17.856 --> 44:19.722
Get it off!
Get it off!

44:22.960 --> 44:24.027
Gill.

44:28.198 --> 44:30.066
Good night, sweet prince.

44:39.076 --> 44:40.276
Was that my fault?

44:40.278 --> 44:42.045
No, Roger.
It was Gill's fault.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.114
Todd said to just pull
as hard as I could...

44:45.116 --> 44:46.949
Well, after
an up-shimmy.

44:47.284 --> 44:49.452
Boys, boys, boys.
It was nobody's fault.

44:50.220 --> 44:53.423
It was just a very, very, very,

44:54.224 --> 44:55.858
tragic accident.

44:55.860 --> 45:00.196
And, uh, we don't blame
you, Roger, at all.

45:00.831 --> 45:03.433
Maybe... maybe that
wasn't Gill.

45:04.168 --> 45:05.368
Maybe Gill had a twin.

45:05.370 --> 45:08.438
No. Gill's
an only child.

45:09.973 --> 45:12.875
Roger, telephone call.

45:12.877 --> 45:15.178
It's frank.
Frank.

45:15.180 --> 45:16.879
I got to take this call.

45:16.881 --> 45:18.181
Right now?
I'm so sorry.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.750
I'll come back to clean.

45:20.752 --> 45:22.952
Take your call, Roger.
Take your phone call.

45:24.154 --> 45:25.188
Say goodbye.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.938
<i>Hello?</i>
Roger, it's frank.

45:41.940 --> 45:45.041
Is there any possible way I could
call you back in 30 minutes?

45:45.043 --> 45:47.744
Nope. The party is pressing
me to make a statement.

45:47.746 --> 45:49.278
The media thinks
a scandal is involved.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.914
"McClaren dick pic"
is trending on Twitter.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.150
Sir, please tell me
there's no such picture.

45:54.152 --> 45:54.150
Oh! Of course not!

45:54.152 --> 45:54.150
<i>But the party's not going
to wait until next week</i>

45:54.152 --> 45:59.021
<i>and they are understandably
forcing my hand.</i>

45:59.023 --> 46:01.057
<i>Which means I have
to force yours.</i>

46:01.059 --> 46:02.859
So, are you in?

46:04.027 --> 46:05.962
Yes. Yes, of course.
I'm in.

46:06.463 --> 46:08.164
<i>Fantastic!</i>

46:08.166 --> 46:10.333
Hey look, channel 3 is
interviewing me on the 4th

46:10.335 --> 46:10.333
and I'd like you here with me

46:10.335 --> 46:13.035
to announce that you're
running for my seat.

46:13.037 --> 46:15.304
Well, I'm actually
still up at trout lake.

46:15.306 --> 46:20.309
And I'm planning
on proposing tomorrow...

46:20.311 --> 46:22.512
You know what, this could
work in our favor.

46:22.913 --> 46:24.447
Newly engaged family man.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.382
Beautiful outdoor setting
in Washington state.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.117
I mean, it's a nice
introduction.

46:28.385 --> 46:30.920
Are you saying we
should do it up here?

46:30.922 --> 46:32.455
Of course. We'll send
a camera crew to you.

46:32.457 --> 46:33.990
We'll satellite you in.

46:34.124 --> 46:35.258
Um...

46:38.195 --> 46:39.829
I think I could make that work.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.330
Your life is going to change.

46:41.332 --> 46:43.966
Thank you, sir.
I'll talk to you soon.

46:56.402 --> 46:58.081
Where are Pam and the boys?

46:58.082 --> 47:04.153
Oh! They just decided to have
a little quiet night in.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.422
You know, little Spencer
was still pretty upset

47:06.424 --> 47:08.357
about the whole Gill thing.

47:08.359 --> 47:10.092
Yeah.
That was rough.

47:11.028 --> 47:14.163
Gill would not want us to
be a bunch of mopey dopes.

47:15.265 --> 47:17.433
I think he would
want us to celebrate.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.502
To future congressman Roger!

47:21.039 --> 47:23.973
All right. A celebration.
Absolutely.

47:23.975 --> 47:26.843
I can't thank you enough
for being so supportive.

47:26.845 --> 47:28.878
And particularly for
allowing a camera crew

47:28.880 --> 47:28.878
to come crash your vacation.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.981
Listen, we weren't going
to let you leave.

47:31.983 --> 47:34.350
And now we get to be a
part of this big moment.

47:34.352 --> 47:35.518
We're excited.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.854
And I know this goes
without saying, but,

47:37.856 --> 47:40.189
please don't say anything to anyone
before the announcement because...

47:40.191 --> 47:43.926
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. Tonight
is a very special night.</i>

47:43.928 --> 47:46.562
<i>I won't say who because
it's not official yet,</i>

47:46.564 --> 47:49.999
<i>but someone here, Roger Fellner,</i>

47:50.001 --> 47:52.268
<i>is running for congress.</i>

47:52.270 --> 47:55.404
<i>So I'd like you all to put
your hands together like this,</i>

47:55.406 --> 47:57.206
<i>and help me get him on up here.</i>

47:58.075 --> 48:02.612
Roger!
Roger! Roger! Roger!

48:05.282 --> 48:08.351
<i>We'd like to dedicate this song
to two very special ladies.</i>

48:08.353 --> 48:11.053
<i>It's</i> deuce princes
<i>by spin doctors.</i>

48:22.300 --> 48:24.333
- Come on, Roger!
- Sing it, Rog!

49:13.283 --> 49:15.418
Look at him go!
He's on fire!

49:15.420 --> 49:17.219
Yeah, baby!

49:22.492 --> 49:24.493
<i>Move the strawberry
into the cart.</i>

49:24.495 --> 49:27.096
<i>No. That's...
No. No.</i>

49:44.982 --> 49:47.650
Hey! Hey, hey, um...
Hey.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.020
Are we still on for our date tonight?
Mmm-hmm.

49:51.022 --> 49:52.989
I was thinking pizza
on main street.

49:52.991 --> 49:56.392
Awesome. How about 5:30,
but, like, be ready at 5:00?

49:59.229 --> 50:00.396
What is that?

50:00.398 --> 50:05.001
Let's get ready to go tubing!

50:05.003 --> 50:07.069
Oh, my god!

50:07.304 --> 50:09.205
You two. On here.
Pronto.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.207
Yeah, I'll go grab
our bathing suits.

50:11.209 --> 50:13.142
How long do you think we'll be?

50:13.410 --> 50:15.177
Once you get on this ride,

50:15.179 --> 50:17.480
you ain't never gonna
want to come back.

50:49.379 --> 50:51.647
Yes, I want a goddamn
glass of wine!

50:52.582 --> 50:52.581
I've got you, brother.

50:52.583 --> 50:55.718
Yeah, I really was happy
just sitting on the boat.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.119
But you're going to love it.

50:57.254 --> 50:58.554
Whoo!

50:59.056 --> 51:01.257
All right.

51:03.693 --> 51:05.061
Whoo!

51:10.467 --> 51:11.834
You trying to bump me?

51:12.669 --> 51:14.203
You're going down!

51:14.738 --> 51:16.572
I'm coming for you, Rog.

51:19.209 --> 51:20.609
Oh! This is so much fun!

51:22.079 --> 51:23.813
Roger! Roger!

51:31.721 --> 51:32.788
Look out, Roger!

51:36.426 --> 51:38.127
No! No! No!

51:42.165 --> 51:43.732
Oh! Oh!

51:44.234 --> 51:45.634
Roger, are you okay?

52:02.586 --> 52:04.386
Hey, sorry about your mug, bro.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.222
It'll be better by Friday.

52:06.224 --> 52:11.861
Hey, for what it's worth... Before you
ate it, you hit some serious air.

52:12.329 --> 52:15.764
You looked like a rock skipped
a human across the lake.

52:16.666 --> 52:19.602
You were like...

52:21.438 --> 52:23.472
Speaking of big splashes, um,

52:23.474 --> 52:25.574
how are you going to
make your announcement?

52:26.409 --> 52:26.408
What do you mean?

52:26.410 --> 52:29.678
I mean, you gotta make a good
first impression, you know.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.314
You've got to wow the voters.
Get them to remember you.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.284
Well, I'm going to
announce that I'm running

52:35.286 --> 52:36.819
and then the endorsement
from congressman McClaren

52:36.821 --> 52:38.354
should be more than enough.

52:38.356 --> 52:41.423
Bro, hear me out.
All right?

52:41.425 --> 52:44.860
What if you like... What if you
like rose out of the lake,

52:45.328 --> 52:51.467
you know, like, "people of Washington,
I am here to lead you, you, you..."

52:52.169 --> 52:53.836
Well, I'm going to say no
to that for two reasons.

52:53.838 --> 52:56.672
One, I'm not here to lead them,
I'm here to represent them.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.207
That's how government works.

52:58.209 --> 53:01.177
And two, how would I
rise out of the water?

53:01.179 --> 53:03.879
I know a guy. His name's Makev. I
could have him here in an hour.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.582
Forty-five minutes if you've
got some cash on you.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.384
It's not going to happen.

53:12.889 --> 53:15.457
Well, I know you've got
a lot of work to do,

53:15.459 --> 53:19.728
so maybe this will turn
that frown upside down.

53:20.897 --> 53:23.232
Todd, where'd you get that? You
got a speech to write, man!

53:23.234 --> 53:24.874
Put that down, Todd!
You've gotta write...

53:26.403 --> 53:28.671
No! No! No!

53:36.613 --> 53:37.947
No...
No, please...

53:49.626 --> 53:51.293
I'm so sorry, honey.

53:51.494 --> 53:53.896
I gotta ask, though, why
was that bag on the boat?

53:55.498 --> 53:56.832
Ask him that.

54:00.570 --> 54:02.304
Still want to go
on our date night?

54:02.639 --> 54:03.839
I don't know.

54:03.841 --> 54:05.774
I think I just need
a moment alone.

54:07.577 --> 54:08.811
Okay.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.012
Right.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.352
Careful.

54:17.554 --> 54:19.355
Hey, Roger, I'm sorry, man.

54:19.823 --> 54:21.857
I'll replace the satchel.

54:22.425 --> 54:25.027
The engagement ring
was in the satchel.

54:25.462 --> 54:28.330
The engagement ring that I was
going to use to propose to Gwen,

54:28.332 --> 54:30.799
right now, is now at
the bottom of the lake,

54:30.801 --> 54:32.501
because of you!

54:33.470 --> 54:34.737
Shit.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.740
Oh! What's this?

54:38.441 --> 54:39.708
A horse.

54:40.343 --> 54:42.411
He was supposed
to wait out front.

54:43.913 --> 54:45.648
He's beautiful.

54:52.422 --> 54:53.889
Honey, are you okay?

54:55.825 --> 54:57.660
Duder...

55:13.843 --> 55:15.377
Oh. Honey,
you woke up!

55:17.747 --> 55:19.915
Well...

55:20.617 --> 55:20.616
What happened?

55:20.618 --> 55:25.654
You ate an entire bag of
grandma Hibby's THC chips.

55:25.922 --> 55:29.391
Todd said it was the equivalent of
nine joints hitting you at once.

55:29.993 --> 55:29.992
I'm so sorry, Roger.

55:29.994 --> 55:34.630
Those weren't potato chips.
They were pot-ate-o chips.

55:34.632 --> 55:36.565
It says so right on the bag.

55:36.866 --> 55:38.667
What was I thinking?

55:42.872 --> 55:44.473
Where is Todd?

55:45.542 --> 55:47.076
You really don't remember?

55:48.745 --> 55:50.546
Remember what?

55:59.389 --> 56:00.756
It is me or is he talking?

56:00.758 --> 56:02.891
Hello, Roger.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.493
High-five, horse.
High-five, horse!

56:05.495 --> 56:07.763
Whoa. Whoa, Roger! You're
going to spook the horse.

56:07.765 --> 56:09.898
Please, Artax!

56:09.900 --> 56:11.767
You have to try.

56:14.371 --> 56:15.437
Look out!

56:17.641 --> 56:18.874
Margie!

56:18.876 --> 56:21.410
Are you okay? I'm okay.
Are you okay?

56:21.412 --> 56:22.811
Oh, my god, I thought I
was going to lose you!

56:22.813 --> 56:23.979
Oh, my god, Todd.
You just saved my life!

56:23.981 --> 56:25.981
Margie, I love you so much.

56:25.983 --> 56:27.883
I love you, Todd.
Will you marry me?

56:27.885 --> 56:29.785
Yes! Yes! Yes!

56:29.787 --> 56:32.654
Yes, I'll marry you! I want
an army of your babies!

56:33.790 --> 56:35.524
Oh, Margie.

56:43.135 --> 56:44.934
I'm glad we sat in the front!

56:44.935 --> 56:48.670
Yeah, why sit in the back?
Roger dodger, hey.

56:48.972 --> 56:52.741
Oh, Roger, our evening
was so romantic.

56:52.743 --> 56:56.845
We had champagne and strawberries
and we saw the most perfect,

56:56.847 --> 56:58.580
beautiful sunset ever.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.482
Beautiful.
I mean, just amazing.

57:00.817 --> 57:02.151
How could it not be?

57:02.819 --> 57:04.586
Gwen and I are going to
sleep in the house tonight

57:04.588 --> 57:06.828
because we thought the two of
you would like to be alone.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.891
Being newly engaged and all.

57:09.092 --> 57:11.026
Oh! Roger,
you're the best!

57:11.428 --> 57:11.427
Hey, I'll meet you inside.

57:11.429 --> 57:14.563
I'm just going to talk
to the r man for a sec.

57:14.565 --> 57:16.598
Yeah, that'll be fine. It
will give me time to prepare.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.100
Plug your ears, Roger.

57:18.468 --> 57:20.669
Didn't hear a thing.
Oh, you will.

57:21.571 --> 57:24.773
Tonight on dotch TV, dotch
is going to touch a butt.

57:28.011 --> 57:29.812
You okay, brother?
I am not your brother.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.448
I am not your friend.
I am not your anything.

57:32.582 --> 57:35.651
And after this trip, I hope I
never have to see you again.

57:36.786 --> 57:38.587
Okay, um, you seem upset.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.756
Because you sabotaged
and then stole my proposal.

57:40.758 --> 57:43.091
I didn't steal your proposal.
You gave it to me.

57:43.093 --> 57:44.626
Are you delusional?

57:44.628 --> 57:46.128
You don't remember?

57:46.130 --> 57:48.597
Cowabunga!

57:48.731 --> 57:49.998
You okay, buddy?

57:50.500 --> 57:51.667
Good.

57:52.936 --> 57:55.671
Do you still want to do your thing?
I don't know

57:56.005 --> 57:57.806
if you're up for it, but...

57:58.475 --> 58:01.877
Ben, what do you say, man?
No way, man.

58:01.879 --> 58:04.012
No way!
Are you joking me?

58:04.014 --> 58:05.881
You can't propose now!

58:05.883 --> 58:08.750
If you do it, you'll regret
it for the rest of your life.

58:08.752 --> 58:10.886
Take it from me,
I'm rock bottom, Hoss.

58:10.888 --> 58:14.556
Dude, check this out.
No. No. No.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.560
Just hear me out, okay.

58:18.562 --> 58:20.629
I'm just saying I don't want
this all to go to waste.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.164
There's a horse here.

58:22.166 --> 58:24.900
I can't believe I'm saying
this, would you mind

58:24.902 --> 58:26.902
if Margie and I go instead?

58:26.904 --> 58:26.902
I won't do it if
you don't want me to.

58:26.904 --> 58:30.706
Yeah, let him take the horse.
What are you going to do with it?

58:30.708 --> 58:32.708
Nothing.
You look like junk!

58:33.176 --> 58:36.912
You look like some jerk-off
socked you right in the face!

58:36.914 --> 58:38.180
Let him take it, man.

58:39.215 --> 58:42.684
Yes! Yes! Yes!

58:43.587 --> 58:45.921
I didn't know what I was
saying because you drugged me!

58:45.923 --> 58:45.921
I did not drug you.

58:45.923 --> 58:51.126
The bag clearly said "pot-ate-o"...
I know what the bag said!

58:51.128 --> 58:52.594
But you got what you
wanted, didn't you, Todd?

58:52.596 --> 58:53.862
You got to propose first.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.532
I didn't get...
It just happened, Roger.

58:56.534 --> 58:58.734
I'm so sorry.
No more words.

58:59.068 --> 59:00.602
No more anything.

59:00.604 --> 59:03.205
For the rest of this trip,
you stay away from me.

59:06.609 --> 59:07.743
Oh.

59:08.678 --> 59:10.212
And I'm declining
your friend request.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.014
No, don't do that.

59:22.725 --> 59:25.260
Ah! He's here!

59:25.262 --> 59:26.762
Oh! Hugs. That's new.

59:26.764 --> 59:30.098
I have literally never been more
happy to see you in my life.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.734
Don't worry, Riggy's here. He's
going to make everything okay.

59:32.736 --> 59:34.570
The news gets in
tomorrow at 3:00.

59:34.572 --> 59:37.039
I brought blazer options.
I like Navy, it's powerful.

59:37.041 --> 59:38.574
But...
You know what?

59:38.576 --> 59:41.143
I can handle all of that now.
What I need you to do,

59:41.145 --> 59:43.278
your sole purpose in being here,

59:43.280 --> 59:46.048
is to keep Todd away
from me all the time.

59:46.050 --> 59:48.984
Belly-man? You won't know he's here.
Thank you.

59:48.986 --> 59:51.119
Riggleman!
Hey! Gwen!

59:51.121 --> 59:53.255
Oh, my god!
Congratulations!

59:53.257 --> 59:54.723
On what?

59:54.725 --> 59:58.327
On your... English-style
vacation home.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.731
The architecture... I've
seen that in England.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.166
You're holding swords.
Oh, yeah.

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:06.234
Miesha is teaching us
combat yoga.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:08.070
It's stretching
but with weapons.

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:10.038
He's a free thinker. Sounds great.
Sounds great.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.808
Honey, Margie and I are going to go
into town to give you time to focus.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:12.808
Thank you so much.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:16.612
If you forget anything, just let
me know and I'll pick it up.

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:18.747
Same goes for you, Riggleman.
Thank you so much.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:21.850
It's great to see you. Oh. Great
to see you. You're a treasure.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:22.618
I'm afraid to ask.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.788
Why did you not propose to
that exceptional woman?

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:29.291
I'm coming to get you!

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.094
Because of that.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.229
That's him?

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.965
He literally has been
ruining my life all week.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.635
And last night he stole
my proposal to Gwen.

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.871
Please, keep him out of my hair.

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:47.309
All right, you go.
I'll take care of this thing.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.177
I am the king!

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.947
Whoo!

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:55.250
This is the most scared
I've ever been in my life.

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.919
And I grew up in Pakistan.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.424
The little mermaid.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.861
Part of your world now.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.099
Hey, you must be Todd.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:15.270
You're Roger's best friend, huh?

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.972
What's your name?

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:20.042
I'm Riggleman. I said
how much do you bench?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.379
I don't work out, so I wouldn't...
Me neither.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.415
Great. Glad that's
out of the way.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.984
Whoa!

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:30.085
I don't know what
you're going for,

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:33.689
but there doesn't seem to
be much definition there.

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:36.858
I'm not a dictionary
so I don't need definition.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:41.697
That word means a few things.
So does "thesaurus".

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.834
Thesaurus means different things?
I think it just means one thing.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:47.069
Prove it.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.038
I'm in town for a few days

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.374
and Roger said you're the
man to show me around.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.942
Roger said I was the man?

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:55.911
To show me around.
I am the man.

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:56.144
To show me around.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:02:00.415
I feel like there's a part of the
sentence you're not listening to.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.384
I am the man.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:04.386
To show me around.
Let's do it!

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.788
Just let me bust
a piss right quick.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.096
Oh. You're...
Going right now.

01:02:15.867 --> 01:02:16.766
What's up?

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:21.503
Um. It's just the un-breaking eye
contact is a little off-putting.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.073
That's also
off-putting.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.978
Let me just go
get my wrist-cuffs.

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:33.448
Oh, boy.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.451
Poor Roger.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:38.420
Ripped his head right off.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.489
- Murderer.
- What a bastard.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.425
Who murders a fish?
Roger does.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.196
Hey, Roger?
Hey, Cathy.

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:49.931
Hey. We're making
beer-garitas.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.967
They're margaritas with beer in them.
You want one?

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.435
No, I'm all right,
but thank you, Cathy.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.104
Okay. Hey, how are
you holding up?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.473
Not bad.
No, I think pretty good.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:02:58.473
You know, just going
over the speech.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:02.177
Making sure I say everything
I want to say. Oh.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.312
Well, yeah, you know, I know
that that's going to be fine.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:07.516
But I meant, how are you holding
up with the whole Todd thing?

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:08.083
What do you mean?

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:11.186
It's pretty clear
that he took your proposal

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.522
or maybe you gave it to him?

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.993
But dessert and port
aren't exactly Todd's style.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.363
A ball-pit, maybe.
But not port.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:23.832
You know, when I first met him

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:27.903
I thought, "this guy has got to
take it down all the notches."

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.473
But then I realized, you know, that
the reason he's got that much energy

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.942
is because he's
got such a big heart.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.344
And I guess

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:38.280
a guy with a big heart
isn't the worst thing

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.348
you could wish
for your daughter.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.818
Yeah, sure. Of course.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.953
This is probably
none of my business,

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.556
but can I give you
some friendly advice?

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.925
Certainly.
Okay.

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.928
As someone who has known
Gwen her entire life,

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.864
she really loves you.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:04:02.204
You could ask her to marry you
in a parking lot and she'd nut.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.043
So, try not to put too much
pressure on the "how" of it.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:12.180
Thank you, Cathy.

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.249
Oh!

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.851
Well, excuse you!

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.520
I'm a little buzzed.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.990
That burp smelled delicious.
Can I get a beer-garita?

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:21.990
You sold me.
The burp sold me.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:26.161
You're going to be good
in this family. Come on.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:36.438
Hey, honey, look. I got
a giant donut! Whoa!

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.273
That's amazing.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.242
Aw!

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:45.013
My ice cream! She
dropped her ice cream.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:47.148
How do we clean it?
It's okay.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:50.252
Problem solved.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.387
Wash it away.
It's okay.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:57.092
Todd cleaned the ice cream with
soda and his shoe. It's all better.

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.960
I'll get you more ice cream.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.898
Good as new.

01:05:03.795 --> 01:05:04.934
Hello, "Giggleman."

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:08.970
Oh. Yeah. Todd gave it to me.
The nickname and the shirt.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.172
I assumed.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.375
That guy is pure
good times, man.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:16.177
We met up with Gwen and Margie.
We went go-kart racing.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:18.313
Except he called it
"go-fart racing".

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:20.015
'Cause it's powered by gas.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.183
Do you get it?

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:24.252
It really was
just go-kart racing.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.355
Oh! We did a Chinese fire
drill, check this out.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:32.327
He did, like, a Chinese
accent the whole time.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.029
But it didn't feel racist.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.198
It felt more like a tribute
to an ancient culture.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.067
He got to you, too.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.636
You really got to give him
another chance, man.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:46.441
It feels good
to do this. Try it.

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.213
All right. Well, I'm
going to go inside.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:53.949
Apparently, I'm
staying here tonight.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:56.184
Todd would not let me
stay at a motel.

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:56.418
Classic Todd.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:01.456
So, you and Gwen are back rooming
with Todd and Margie, okay?

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.727
Todd, do you want to
teach me how to swim?

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.746
Cool.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:02.784
Roger? Roger, wake up!
You're covered in ants!

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.395
They're biting!
They're biting!

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.499
Ew! I can see his butt.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.036
That's what they want.

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.670
That's my ice cream.

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:30.645
Oh. Look, he's skinny-dipping!
Good for him.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.523
Dad, the news Van is here.
Shut up!

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:45.126
Hi there. Dana Curlman. Hi.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.366
I feel like I might be
wearing too much makeup.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:54.536
No, Margie did a great job. You
can't see any of the bites, honey.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.604
I look like a peach mime.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.474
I think it's going to read
differently on camera, okay?

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:02.777
God, they really got in here.
I know.

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.479
Thank you for doing this.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:04.479
It's not my first time.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:07.415
Remember when I got
attacked by all those mites

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.185
when we were building
that library in Peru?

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.620
Yeah. Hey.

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.158
I'm really gonna miss you
when you leave.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.694
I'm going to miss you, too.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.233
And I'm very sorry for how
this week has panned out.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.169
I wanted things to
go very differently.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:34.142
And I actually was
planning to ask you to...

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:36.611
Hey, Roger. Oh.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.115
Was I interrupting?

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.517
Um. No? No. We should
get you mic'd up.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.185
All right. Um.
Wish me luck?

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:46.587
Good luck!

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.263
Wait, where's Todd?

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:56.564
I don't know. He said he
knew this was big for you,

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:58.265
so he had to get out of here.

01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.801
Good.
Kind of miss him.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:03.604
Hi. Dana Curlman.
Cascade news 3.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:07.274
Let's hit it. I'm jazzed and we're
going to be live very, very soon.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:12.346
Can I ask you, is the
makeup intentional?

01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:15.149
Do you think it's too much?
Yes, it is.

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:18.620
But it is too late. Here we go, guys.
Let's do this dang thing.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.491
We're live. Go.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.827
Welcome, Roger.
<i>Hi, tom. Hi, Jules.</i>

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.429
Ooh! Look at Roger. He looks good.
<i>Well, thanks for having me.</i>

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.298
Does he look too orange?

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.433
His face looks like it's
covered in Cheetos dust.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.403
There's an ant coming out of his nose!
What? Oh, my god...

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.241
There's an ant...

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.345
<i>Uh.
Do you need a tissue?</i>

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.680
<i>Sorry.
No. Just an ant.</i>

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.716
No. He's done.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.618
With the ant thing, it's over.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:55.190
<i>I grew up in Seattle.
It's a city I love.</i>

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:55.190
<i>It's a city I know. I've been
working with congressman McClaren</i>

01:09:55.192 --> 01:10:02.864
<i>these last five years and in that
time unemployment has dropped 2%.</i>

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.533
<i>High school graduation rates
are at an all-time high.</i>

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.202
Wait, is that Todd?

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.937
Is that Todd?

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.906
Yeah. That's Todd.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.342
Wow! He's got some height.
<i>Roger Fellner for congress!</i>

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.346
America loves this man!

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.782
America needs this man!

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:23.418
I can't even dream this stuff,
get the freak in the back.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.421
Roger! It's me, Todd!

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.690
Roger Fellner for congress!

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:31.859
<i>Just having fun up here
on vacation with the fam.</i>

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:34.829
Leave! Leave!

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:38.233
I can't hear you
over the jet shoes.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.368
I said turn it off!

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.402
Turn that off!
You're ruining it!

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.404
Do you hate this?
Yes!

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:46.574
The innovation of the
people of Washington.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.911
If you don't leave I'm going to kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.480
Leave!
Makev! Let's go!

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.317
Okay, he is going to hit him.

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.387
Roger, I'm sorry!
Watch out!

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:00.755
Roger, I'm sorry!

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.692
Roger!
Whoa!

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.594
Roger!

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.998
<i>Roger Fellner
is now unconscious.</i>

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:26.414
He's like iron man.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.353
This is amazing!
All right!

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.292
Now that's news!

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.396
<i>Roger Fellner.
Guy worth saving.</i>

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:42.897
<i>Guy worth voting for.</i>

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.832
Hell of a tagline.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.769
I felt like a superhero!
God, Todd!

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:50.004
It was the best, it was...

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:56.544
I don't even know where it came from.
I don't know how I did it.

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:00.915
I mean, that was awesome.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.718
And I gotta tell you,
seeing your face now.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.588
It is busted. Honestly,
that makeup was not that bad.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.992
Well, thank you for today
and we will catch you later.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:13.394
Todd, you my dude!

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.398
Roger, are you okay?

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:23.037
All things considered,
that went okay.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:25.506
And Todd said we can try
his water boots.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.942
This is even worse than
ripping off Gill's head.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.944
I'm just glad he had clothes on.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:33.481
Roger, I wouldn't go to sleep tonight.
I'm sure you're concussed.

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.783
You know I can't vote for
you now, guy. Right?

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.634
How many times did I tell
you to leave me alone?

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.036
How many times
did I say stay away?

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.704
Easy. Easy.
You punched me?

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.040
Yes, and it felt wonderful!

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.909
What is wrong with you?

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.445
What is wrong with me?

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:09.650
Him! He just destroyed my political
career on live television!

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.519
Looks to me like
he saved your ass.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:12.587
That's because you're an idiot!

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:13.654
You're out of line, Roger.

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.823
I'm the only one
being honest, Jerry!

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.393
You should not be content with
this man marrying your daughter.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.395
She could do so much better.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:22.530
You need to apologize
to Todd right now.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.065
How are you not on my side?

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:27.869
I am on your side, but it is
not okay to assault people!

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:31.939
Gwen, if anything,
he should apologize to me!

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.742
I'm sorry. I don't
want your apology!

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.711
Do you hear yourself right now?

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.813
You've completely
lost your mind!

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:42.950
He knocked me into the water! He
didn't save me! He caused it!

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.552
I know, but that
was an accident.

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:46.421
He doesn't have
a mean bone in his body.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:48.089
He is a menace!

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.992
There's one person right now who's
a screaming, raving lunatic

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:52.460
and that is you.
Why would that be?

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:53.828
Do you understand
what I am going through?

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:56.664
Gwen, you don't know half
of what's transpired, okay?

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:56.664
Well, why don't you tell me!

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.100
No. You don't tell me
anything that's going on.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.635
I can't tell you everything!

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:00.635
Things affect me, too!

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:04.572
And when you decide out of the blue
that you're gonna run for congress

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:04.572
that has an effect on me!

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:08.643
And so does you leaving the country
for three months at a time!

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.846
Have you communicated with me,
or asked how I feel about that?

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.816
Well, how do you feel about it?
I hate it!

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.452
I think if you really
want to help people

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:20.655
you should give them something
like food, not young-adult novels.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.661
All right.
Gwen...

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:29.030
No. I hear you.
I'm sorry.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:31.866
You think I'm a joke,
and you hate my family.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.669
I'm really glad to know,
a couple of years in,

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:36.391
that this whole time
you thought I'm a fool.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.039
I don't...
So I think,

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.107
now would be a perfect
time for you to go.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.946
You want me to go home?

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.686
Great.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:52.820
That's great.

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:56.924
Oh. And by the way,

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.261
"I'm gonna nut" means ejaculate!

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.563
Let's go.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:04.799
That's disgusting.
Why would he say that?

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:06.534
Cathy, that part's true.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.651
Hey, Roger.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:43.938
I just want to say thank you for
a wonderful couple of days.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.941
Switching gears
a little bit, um,

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:49.677
I lost my cell
phone charger in there.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.946
It's a Samsung android s3.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.815
It's like the s4
but a fewer prongs.

01:15:54.817 --> 01:15:57.057
You know how they just change
the chargers for no reason.

01:15:57.819 --> 01:16:01.889
I know this is a weird time to bring
it up, but it is a discontinued model.

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.025
It's got metal gray...

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:10.691
It's our candidate, folks!

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.294
I just want to thank all of
you for all your hard work.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.029
I really appreciate it.

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:18.299
Place isn't much, but it's the
best I could do on short notice.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.800
No. No, the place
is wonderful.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.236
I just hope everyone realizes
I'm going to lose.

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:24.038
Why would you say that?

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:24.305
I fell into a lake
on live television.

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:28.376
Yeah. People love it. It's gone viral.
Where have you been?

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:31.779
Purposely avoiding all media.
Look at this.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:31.779
It's got three
million views on YouTube.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:35.650
<i>Roger Fellner.
Guy worth saving.</i>

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:36.784
<i>Guy worth voting for.</i>

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:38.419
And you've become a meme, look.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.122
There's you being rescued
from the <i>Titanic.</i>

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:43.424
There's you with
the water-skiing squirrel.

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.660
Your own commemorative cereal.

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.896
That's just you
coming out of a toilet.

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:52.066
That's also... A bunch of
just different toilets.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:55.703
It's really so flattering to have the
entire country making fun of me.

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.939
Roger, this is a good thing.
This is a real human moment.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.242
People look at this and go,
"well, I could fall into a lake.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.044
"I should vote
for this guy."

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:05.413
Hey, Pete, play
the <i>Maddow</i> piece.

01:18:05.823 --> 01:18:07.082
<i>And finally tonight,</i>

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:10.885
<i>I'm sure you've all seen the Seattle
politician fall into a lake</i>

01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:13.087
<i>while announcing his run
for a congressional seat.</i>

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:17.024
<i>Yes, a near-drowning on live
TV is a bit of a blunder,</i>

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.094
<i>but the quick thinking of a
family member saved his life,</i>

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:20.094
<i>and with it, his chance
at public office.</i>

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:25.833
<i>Well, now, new footage has surfaced
of the accident-prone candidate</i>

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:30.971
<i>and his rescuer just crushing
the spin doctors on karaoke.</i>

01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:33.041
<i>Somebody smart once said,</i>

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:37.912
<i>"judge a person's character by
who he surrounds himself with."</i>

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.847
<i>Well, with friends like these,</i>

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:43.017
<i>Roger Fellner seems like
a stand-up guy.</i>

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:47.354
<i>Or rather, "a guy worth saving.
A guy worth voting for."</i>

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.132
So, we are all set for the
fundraiser on Friday.

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:01.802
And this is for you,
it was sent to my house.

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:04.805
Good night, Roger.

01:20:13.571 --> 01:20:15.010
Is that your boyfriend?

01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:19.947
Oh. Hey, man, sorry. I didn't
realize anyone was still here.

01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:22.950
You look happy.
You and your boyfriend.

01:20:22.952 --> 01:20:26.153
No. He's not my boyfriend.
No, no. He's, um...

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.824
He's a...

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.432
Do you want me to move?
No. No. No. You're good.

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.984
All right, ready, zip!

01:20:56.986 --> 01:20:57.985
What is it?

01:20:57.987 --> 01:21:00.020
"Cabbie penny
needs a potty."

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.190
Wait, what did it start as?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.525
"Katy Perry's
a hottie."

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.460
Yeah, she is!

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.863
Don't tell your parents
I said that, okay?

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:10.130
'Cause I could
get in big trouble.

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.198
Hi.

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:18.105
Do you think I could
talk to you for a second?

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:25.246
Hey, Micah.

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:28.082
Can you please tell our guest that
these are not visiting hours?

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.950
These are not visiting hours.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:33.120
Thank you, Micah.
I can hear him.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.292
I just need two minutes.
Hear me out.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:41.562
And if you don't want to see me
again, I'll leave you alone.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.231
Hey, Micah.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:45.266
Can you please tell our guest

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:49.603
that if he would like to arrange a time
to talk that's not during our hang time

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:49.603
that would be much better?

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:53.908
He said... Yeah, I heard him, Micah.
Thank you.

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.609
Um...

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:57.978
Okay.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:09.089
Okay, little homies.
Where were we?

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.058
Red-hair Ralph.
Mickey got another one.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.426
Give it to me, brother.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.037
Hey, Micah.

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:25.205
Can you please tell our guest

01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:27.074
that if he would like
to talk to me right now

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:28.716
that he could call me up
on the telephone.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.412
Todd, I've tried calling...

01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:00.374
"Limes harden in a lunch room.
Nine times a night."

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:03.577
What did it start as?

01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:06.447
"I'm sorry that I punched you.
I had no right."

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.553
I acted like such a jerk
and there are no excuses,

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:14.388
but if you give me a second
chance I would love...

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.323
Your round is over.

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:24.064
Okay. Guys, thank you very
much for letting me interrupt.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:25.466
I hope you have fun.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:31.405
You deserve a better
brother-in-law than me.

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:35.609
You're not safe here.

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.213
None of you are!

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.749
That beam is the safe zone.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.784
And he is it!

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.420
Freeze tag!

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.525
It's on!

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:00.300
Hit him.

01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:29.130
I take it you got my package.

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:34.068
I did. Todd, that was amazing.
Thank you so much.

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.603
Though I don't know if I'll
have much use for it now.

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:38.672
Gwen won't even return my calls.

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:42.543
Come on, buddy. You know
she still loves you.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:45.546
She's been moping around the
house for like two weeks.

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:47.714
Makes for an awful roommate.

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:51.819
You know, her big
fundraiser's tomorrow night.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:52.553
I do know this.

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:59.193
In fact, part of the reason I came here...
Is I need your help.

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.628
Say it again.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.665
I need your help. Say
it real loud this time.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.768
I need your help!

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.837
Now, say it... Say it
like a weird baby.

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.439
I need your help!

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:13.640
Let's do it!

01:25:13.642 --> 01:25:18.278
<i>Without funding, thousands of
people won't have access to books</i>

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.582
<i>and the priceless knowledge
contained within their pages.</i>

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:25.452
<i>We view every book in our
libraries as a chance.</i>

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:26.854
<i>A chance to learn.</i>

01:25:26.856 --> 01:25:31.391
<i>Help give that chance to the
people of the sundarbans.</i>

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:35.462
<i>Because when a book is in your hands,
the world is at your fingertips.</i>

01:25:37.266 --> 01:25:41.268
<i>All right, I would like to call
upon our pledge donations.</i>

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.670
<i>Can I get the house
lights up, please?</i>

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:47.407
<i>Let's start with our golden
bookmark donors.</i>

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:51.812
<i>Who here is willing
to pledge $10,000?</i>

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.585
<i>Really? Nobody?</i>

01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:01.388
<i>Oh! We have one.
Yes! Thank you so much.</i>

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.757
<i>No, you are a waiter.</i>

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.226
<i>Um. Okay, let's move
on to our next...</i>

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.364
What just happened?
This is ridiculous.

01:26:22.578 --> 01:26:25.345
Aw, yeah, give it up for books!

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.848
Put your hands in your
pockets, get the cash out!

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.450
Put your hands in your
pockets, get the cash out!

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:32.386
Yo, these kids are books!

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.772
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the actual spin doctors!</i>

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.944
That's not the spin doctors.

01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:01.763
Now we're talking.

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:36.250
Hey.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.553
I don't know when I started
taking you for granted,

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:40.787
but shame on me.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.956
I don't hate that you do this.
I don't.

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.359
I love you because you do this.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:47.427
What I hate is
being away from you.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.798
Being with you will always be
my greatest accomplishment.

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:58.739
I love being with you so much, I am willing
to say in front of all these people,

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:02.809
that I am okay with having
him for a brother-in-law.

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:08.015
It's me.

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:15.956
Gwen Elaine Turley,

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.659
will you marry me?

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:20.761
Yes!

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.505
<i>Now, I'm going
to ask one more time.</i>

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:35.609
<i>Who here is now willing
to pledge $10,000</i>

01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:37.044
<i>for some literacy?</i>

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:47.487
If you think just because you had the
spin doctors play a hit from 1993

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:52.492
that's suddenly going to inspire
me to write a check for $10,000

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.795
I have one question
for you, sir.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.066
Do you have a pen?

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.537
Oh, my god!

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.939
Thank you.

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:22.689
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:28.729
I also now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:31.865
You may kiss the brides.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.603
Oh, oh!

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:38.739
You've got an ant...

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:42.442
Now, can we please go party?

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.632
Guys, she's all mine!
She's all mine!

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.980
Hey, I like the facial
adjustments, uncle Mel.

01:30:19.982 --> 01:30:23.683
Thanks. It's easier to maintain,
and it's a little more classy.

01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:25.585
More handsome.
You think so?

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:26.720
Uh-huh.

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:32.159
Mel! Oh!

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.028
Whoa!

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:37.664
Ooh! Careful, Spencer!

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.466
Thanks, Roger.
No problem.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.901
Hey, Roger?

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.510
They tell a story.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.956
Go, Giggleman!
Go, Giggleman! Go, Giggleman!

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.595
How was Bangladesh, guys?

01:31:08.597 --> 01:31:10.597
Oh, I think it was
the trip we needed.

01:31:10.599 --> 01:31:12.599
Yeah, we helped a lot of people.

01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:14.534
We built a school
and we dug a well.

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:15.735
And we put in
a Wi-Fi tower.

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:17.938
Now, they have a full,
electronic library.

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.906
This guy thinks of everything.

01:31:19.908 --> 01:31:22.709
I feel sort of guilty
that you lost the election.

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:22.709
No.

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:26.613
It was pretty hard to come back once
it came out that I murdered Gill.

01:31:26.615 --> 01:31:28.014
Yeah. People loved
that fish.

01:31:45.768 --> 01:31:46.667
Todd!

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:49.636
I owed you one. It's just
like the one we had.

01:31:49.638 --> 01:31:52.772
Get on up there, man.
Ride off into the sunset.

01:31:52.774 --> 01:31:54.074
Actually just to the end
of the driveway

01:31:54.076 --> 01:31:55.976
'cause that horse
isn't allowed on the street.

01:31:55.978 --> 01:31:58.912
But I did get you a limo to
take you to the airport, so...

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:00.881
There you go.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.016
Thank you, brother.
Come here.

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.721
Oh. I have
something for you.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.065
I love you.

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:23.603
I know. Just let the moment happen.
There's no words...

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.706
We'll see you when we get back.

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:28.642
Adorable. You'll see
me on the plane.

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:32.112
The plane?
Surprise!

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:35.715
Dual honeymoon! We booked the
room right next to yours!

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:37.284
Oh!

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:40.153
The party continues.
It always does.

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:43.557
We can get walkie talkies.
We can do everything together.

01:32:43.559 --> 01:32:46.726
Do you like pizza? I can't believe
I've never asked you that before.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.850
Roger.
Look at me.

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.285
Mmm-hmm.

01:33:12.287 --> 01:33:14.321
Sorry. Sorry.

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:16.756
I'm doing it, Roger!

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.894
Roger! I'm helping!

01:33:20.896 --> 01:33:22.929
You're not helping.
Do you hate this?

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:25.932
Come on, Pam.

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:31.838
Ow!

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:31.838
It's been two years, which
is a very acceptable time.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:37.744
Two years is nothing. I could
sit on one box for two years

01:33:37.746 --> 01:33:39.746
and it wouldn't phase me... You
will sit on a box for two years?

01:33:39.748 --> 01:33:41.147
I have done it.

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:42.983
Where were you when you sat
on a box for two years?

01:33:42.985 --> 01:33:44.284
Cleveland.

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.356
Yes!

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:53.960
Oh!

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:56.630
Nobody gets Dana Curlman wet.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.232
Unless I want them to.

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:07.707
Be the Riggleman that
you've always wanted to be.

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.707
'Cause that's what you deserve.

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:12.045
Every day look at yourself
and go, "I did it."

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:15.148
Oh. You dropped
your ice cream!

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.412
Okay. Bye.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:48.348
What are you doing?
Making a movie?

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.116
How did you...

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:55.755
What just happened?
