20:34.600 --> 20:37.202
Flattening my breasts

20:38.904 --> 20:41.607
It disguises everything

and rapacious men.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.946

No...
I will stay in this world.

I killed them.

Only ceremonies

38:28.005 --> 38:30.541

- We'll save it, honey.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.872
- It don't hurt that bad, daddy.
Really.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.847
- Look, you act like a man

41:22.913 --> 41:24.281
so I'm gonna
talk to you like a man,

41:24.348 --> 41:25.549
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.355
It don't matter
how much it hurts,

41:31.422 --> 41:36.760
what matters is
if it gets infected.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.730
And the way you can tell it's
infected is if you have a fever.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.601
- What do I do
if I get a fever?

41:43.667 --> 41:45.135
- There ain't much
we can do here.

41:45.202 --> 41:47.238
We got to get you to the fort.

41:47.304 --> 41:49.106
- What can they do at the fort?

41:49.173 --> 41:51.642
- They got medicines for fever.

41:51.709 --> 41:55.813
Willow bark tea,
opium for the pain.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.414
You can sweat it
out in a bath.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.286
And we can pray.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.724
- You don't pray.

42:06.790 --> 42:10.294
- I've prayed plenty.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.395
It just ain't worked.

42:18.235 --> 42:20.905
- I'm fine, daddy.

42:20.971 --> 42:22.673
I don't have a fever.

42:24.508 --> 42:25.609
It don't hurt.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.847
- You just try and sleep
and be still.

42:31.982 --> 42:33.550
They can cauterize
the outside of you,

42:33.617 --> 42:37.755
but time's the only thing
that can stitch the inside.

42:42.927 --> 42:45.062
[music]

43:28.472 --> 43:30.774
- I need a fucking shovel.

43:30.841 --> 43:32.743
Ground's so fucking hard...

43:32.810 --> 43:34.945
Been digging for an hour
and it's barely a foot deep.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.614
- I'll find you a shovel.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.720
- She'd gone mad.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.290
Wild, like a rabid dog.

43:46.357 --> 43:47.658
Scalped her...

43:47.725 --> 43:49.526
Killed her husband,
stuck her full of arrows.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.162
What was I supposed to do, huh?

43:52.229 --> 43:54.832
Leave her there to suffer and
take three days to die?!

43:54.898 --> 43:56.967
- You did the right thing.

43:57.034 --> 43:58.769
- I know.

43:58.836 --> 43:59.770
It just...

44:02.940 --> 44:04.708
It don't feel right.

44:11.015 --> 44:13.117
She snarled at me
like a coyote.

44:14.885 --> 44:16.286
And I fucking shot her.

44:18.622 --> 44:21.325
- Don't do that.

44:21.392 --> 44:23.961
You made a decision.

44:24.028 --> 44:25.329
You did what you
thought was decent.

44:27.531 --> 44:28.465
Was it decent?

44:30.334 --> 44:32.302
Who knows.

44:32.369 --> 44:36.907
What the hell is decent
out here, what's the gauge?

44:39.943 --> 44:41.578
You're the gauge.

44:41.645 --> 44:42.579
[music]

44:45.015 --> 44:46.450
You made a decision.

44:47.951 --> 44:49.086
Now stand by it.

44:50.854 --> 44:53.057
Right or wrong,
you fucking stand by it.

45:04.802 --> 45:05.903
- Okay.

45:11.575 --> 45:13.410
It was the best thing
I thought to do.

45:17.448 --> 45:18.415
I stand by it.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.619
- I'll find you a shovel.

45:22.686 --> 45:24.054
And I'll help you use it.

46:08.365 --> 46:10.334
- Where's John?

46:10.400 --> 46:13.303
- Thomas took him to sleep
in one of the other wagons.

46:21.178 --> 46:22.379
- How bad was it?

46:23.714 --> 46:25.749
- The blood was dark.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.684
From the liver.

46:27.751 --> 46:30.287
Arrow clipped it for sure.

46:30.354 --> 46:31.355
Who knows how bad?

46:33.390 --> 46:37.127
But she's young
and she's strong--

46:37.194 --> 46:38.262
- I know.

46:55.812 --> 46:56.747
Walk with me, honey.

47:10.694 --> 47:13.597
You were a nurse in the war.

47:13.664 --> 47:14.598
- So?

47:18.035 --> 47:21.371
- So, how many liver shots
did you see survive?

47:21.438 --> 47:23.240
- We got it out fast, James.

47:25.742 --> 47:26.910
- Let me see it.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.159
It's filthy, honey.

47:43.460 --> 47:44.661
- She's young.

47:44.728 --> 47:46.463
She's young
and she's so strong.

47:46.530 --> 47:50.367
- And she's the light of
my life and she's my soul...

47:58.875 --> 48:00.344
She's gonna die.

48:03.547 --> 48:07.251
- How fucking dare you?

48:07.317 --> 48:10.220
I will not lose a child.

48:11.455 --> 48:13.223
I will not lose a...

48:13.290 --> 48:15.892
[sobbing]

48:17.628 --> 48:21.064
- She's gonna die

48:21.131 --> 48:22.766
and it's gonna cut us in two,

48:24.968 --> 48:26.270
and if we don't
accept it now

48:26.336 --> 48:30.707
she'll die in some fort
with some doctor

48:30.774 --> 48:35.078
doping her up so badly
she can't see straight,

48:35.145 --> 48:37.147
then we will have robbed her.

48:39.816 --> 48:43.287
She needs to see every sunrise
and every sunset.

48:45.522 --> 48:49.793
And we will lie to her, and
we will tell her she's fine.

48:52.529 --> 48:55.532
And we will let her
look at this world

48:55.599 --> 48:56.900
with those big, dreamer eyes,

49:00.103 --> 49:01.271
'till they can't see anymore.

49:02.873 --> 49:04.775
- And then what are we gonna do?

49:06.510 --> 49:10.180
She's gonna be another cross
on a trail that we don't visit.

49:12.716 --> 49:17.754
Ten years from now,
it's just... gone?

49:17.821 --> 49:20.223
- Our wagon drive is over.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.026
Where we bury her
is where we stay.

49:23.093 --> 49:24.995
That is our home.

49:25.062 --> 49:27.597
- Not here.
Not in this place.

49:29.599 --> 49:31.668
- No. Not in this place.

49:33.103 --> 49:35.472
I will find the place.

49:35.539 --> 49:37.207
By God, I will find a place.

49:59.563 --> 50:00.664
[sobs]

50:05.702 --> 50:06.970
- I need a minute.

50:32.462 --> 50:34.831
[music]

50:55.886 --> 50:56.820
- You ready?

50:58.288 --> 50:59.723
- We're ready.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.758
- How's your lady?

51:01.825 --> 51:03.460
- Who says she's my lady?

51:04.728 --> 51:06.029
- How's your lady?

51:09.399 --> 51:11.001
- She lived through it, Captain.

51:13.036 --> 51:16.473
- You will get tough or die in
this country, that's for sure.

51:16.540 --> 51:19.876
- If we can make it to Oregon,

51:19.943 --> 51:22.012
you won't be able to cut
her skin with a knife.

51:26.416 --> 51:27.884
[Elsa moans]

51:29.719 --> 51:31.888
- How are you feeling?

51:31.955 --> 51:33.557
- Like I got a fever.

51:38.361 --> 51:39.896
- You feel fine to me.

51:42.265 --> 51:43.266
Can you sit up?

51:50.040 --> 51:52.175
[grunts]

51:52.242 --> 51:53.376
Sore?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.283
- Hurts today.

52:01.384 --> 52:03.353
- I bet.

52:03.420 --> 52:06.857
Come ride on the buckboard.

52:06.923 --> 52:10.093
This wagon will absolutely
tear you to pieces back here.

52:12.829 --> 52:14.164
- I'd rather ride.

52:16.132 --> 52:17.834
Can I ride?

52:17.901 --> 52:19.135
- Sure, honey.
You can ride.

52:21.404 --> 52:23.540
- I'm wearing pants.

52:23.607 --> 52:26.142
I don't give a shit what
they say at the fort.

52:26.209 --> 52:27.911
- Wear whatever you want.

52:39.122 --> 52:41.124
- I figured you wouldn't want
to be churned like buttermilk

52:41.191 --> 52:43.426
in the back of that thing.

52:56.206 --> 52:57.641
Swing your leg over slow.

52:58.875 --> 53:00.544
[groans]

53:08.318 --> 53:10.220
- Didn't hurt at all yesterday.

53:13.490 --> 53:15.692
Guess it saved all
the pain for today.

53:15.759 --> 53:17.994
- The day after's always worse.

53:18.061 --> 53:18.995
- What about the next day?

53:21.364 --> 53:22.566
- The next day's a mystery.

53:44.588 --> 53:48.325
- I looked at my father,
looked past his smile.

53:50.393 --> 53:51.595
Saw his worry.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.966
Saw something deeper.

53:56.032 --> 53:57.867
As if he were
already in mourning.

54:03.173 --> 54:04.841
As if I were already gone.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.310
[clicks tongue]

54:07.377 --> 54:09.512
[music]

54:18.088 --> 54:20.457
I felt different too,

54:20.523 --> 54:22.692
felt as though my soul
had been dislodged

54:22.759 --> 54:25.228
from whatever
cavern in our chest

54:25.295 --> 54:27.964
the soul is connected to.

54:28.031 --> 54:30.400
It felt loose.

54:30.467 --> 54:33.336
Disconnected.

54:33.403 --> 54:35.772
I looked out at the sagebrush.

54:35.839 --> 54:37.774
The colors looked different.

54:37.841 --> 54:40.343
Sharper.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.946
Looked up at the sky.

54:43.013 --> 54:45.882
The clouds seemed
to race above us,

54:45.949 --> 54:49.052
as if new rules applied
to time and space above me.

54:54.190 --> 54:58.495
I looked back at my father,
and I studied his eyes.

55:01.631 --> 55:03.333
Looked deep into them.

55:09.039 --> 55:14.511
That's when I knew
I was going to die.

55:35.231 --> 55:37.834
[music]
