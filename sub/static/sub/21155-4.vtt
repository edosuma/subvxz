00:01.335 --> 00:03.826
Previously, on "Killjoys"...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.377
Whatever Khlyen
did to me gave me

00:05.381 --> 00:07.087
some kind of control
over the plasma.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.252
- Delle Seyah.
Wasn't sure you'd actually show.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.013
- So you aren't coming back yet.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.720
- Back home soon.
Tap my heart.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.339
- You are now a black mark

00:16.350 --> 00:18.557
on every other RAC unit
in the J colonies.

00:18.561 --> 00:21.018
- Banyon, new head bitch
in charge.

00:21.022 --> 00:24.185
- On what planet
were you a warlord?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.266
- Oh, like you don't
have skeletons?

00:27.278 --> 00:31.317
- Zeph!
New nerd, meet old nerd.

00:31.324 --> 00:33.690
Now, that looks like something
you'd call the Remnant.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.532
- Put your ego aside
and figure out

00:35.536 --> 00:36.742
how to open this for the team.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.611
Or we'll never find Aneela.

00:38.623 --> 00:41.035
- Welcome to my ship.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.328
Tell me everything.

00:46.589 --> 00:50.753
- Okay, baby.
Come to Papa.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.625
- Don't touch it!

00:52.637 --> 00:54.798
The Remnant's core temperature
is 50 degrees

00:54.805 --> 00:56.716
below its exterior.
- I know.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.555
See my pretty gloves?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.301
- Which won't protect you from
a super-pretty plague.

01:01.312 --> 01:04.896
- Okay, in your corners, nerds.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.515
Turin built us this
super pretty Black Site

01:07.527 --> 01:10.815
so you two pocket protectors
can play nice.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.779
Now, what's the problem?

01:13.783 --> 01:15.648
In normal people words.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.696
— The Remnant's interior
is refrigerated,

01:17.703 --> 01:19.659
so whatever's inside
is probably organic,

01:19.664 --> 01:21.450
and possibly contagious.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.072
- And you were just gonna
laser it in half?

01:23.084 --> 01:25.575
- Do | tell you
how to punch things?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.668
- So we are no closer
to opening it?

01:27.672 --> 01:30.584
- Depends... unzip your shirt
and show me your nipples.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.673
- Remember when we talked
about "office appropriate"?

01:32.677 --> 01:35.510
- It's not for anything weird.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.504
| just want to attach

01:37.515 --> 01:38.800
these and get some readings.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.094
- Of what?
- You obviously have

01:41.102 --> 01:43.764
some kind of mojo over Hullen
plasma and tech.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.807
If we can harness that,
maybe you can

01:45.815 --> 01:48.557
open the Remnant like how
you opened the Hullen ship.

01:48.568 --> 01:49.648
- You sign off on this?

01:49.652 --> 01:51.608
- Hey, you wanted us
to play nice.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.819
- So, do you want to swallow it,

01:53.823 --> 01:56.906
or should ljust, like,
rub it on you?

01:56.909 --> 01:59.651
-As much as I love being
your guinea bitch, Zeph,

01:59.662 --> 02:01.448
me and my nipples are off limits

02:01.455 --> 02:03.116
until you can do
some more research.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.910
- What...
- Come on, let's go.

02:04.917 --> 02:05.906
- Where are you going?

02:05.918 --> 02:08.625
- Killjoy stuff.

02:08.629 --> 02:13.464
Today, Johnny becomes a man.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.423
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm not ready.

02:15.428 --> 02:18.545
- Tradition says five stars,
five shots.

02:18.556 --> 02:19.796
- l was hoping
for the alcohol kind.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.843
- Later.
Ready, Jaqobis?

02:21.851 --> 02:24.684
- Just remember all the hair
jokes I didn't make, okay?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.471
- Oh, yeah?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.522
Fold him in half!

02:37.533 --> 02:38.864
- Let a girl tag in.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.483
- Be my guest.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.042
- Our newest Level V!

02:53.049 --> 02:54.914
Johnny Jaqobisl

02:56.594 --> 02:59.006
Oh, and, uh,
next round's on Turin.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.005
- Only one!
Bunch of degenerates.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.721
- Big day for our boy.
- I guess.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.936
Just feels weird
celebrating RAC ranks

03:08.939 --> 03:10.895
when we know it's been
infiltrated by the Hullen.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.686
- Not for long, General D.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.684
Someone's got that
urge to purge.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.811
- Yeah, but I can't do it alone.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.778
And we still have no pilots
for our mystery fleet.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.694
No heavy infantry.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.692
- We're on our last keg of
Kyrellian Hokk.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.490
- Then be a peach and bring up
a case of szati instead.

03:25.498 --> 03:26.954
I like when you lift
heavy things.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.915
- Yeah, okay.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.659
- Didn't I break his leg once?

03:31.671 --> 03:33.662
- Gared?
Maybe.

03:33.673 --> 03:34.913
-And then you stabbed him

03:34.924 --> 03:36.539
because he was trying
to steal your bar.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.506
- He had some anger issues
backthen,

03:38.511 --> 03:40.047
but we worked it out.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.794
He's much better
at feelings now.

03:41.806 --> 03:44.548
- Prima Dezz, are you blushing?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.049
— Okay, first, I don't blush,
l glow.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.974
And this is not how barstool
privilege works, princess.

03:50.981 --> 03:54.473
Everything on my side of the bar
is my business.

03:54.485 --> 03:58.478
Everything on your side of
the bar... is my business.

04:00.950 --> 04:03.236
- Hey.
Thanks.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.781
Getting a promotion when your
bosses might be evil parasites

04:05.788 --> 04:08.495
kind of takes the "yay"
out of it, but...

04:08.499 --> 04:10.080
man, I really wanted my Level V.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.620
- Got to fill up
those upper ranks,

04:11.627 --> 04:13.868
so many Killjoys missing.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.494
Would have V'd you
a long time ago,

04:15.506 --> 04:17.588
but your sister-partner there

04:17.591 --> 04:19.252
shot me down every time I tried.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.969
- Dutch rank-blocked me?
Why?

04:23.973 --> 04:25.884
- Congrats, Jaqobis.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.974
You accept drinks from
out-of—townies?

04:28.978 --> 04:31.845
- | always accept drinks
from the little people.

04:31.856 --> 04:33.972
Thanks.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.645
- No sides, no bribes.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.517
All: The Warrant is all.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.693
Name's Flik.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.066
You've been locked and served.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.783
- Yeah, right.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.994
Whoa, like hells I am!
For what?

04:48.998 --> 04:51.535
- For the murder of
Delle Seyah Kendry.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.290
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

05:01.302 --> 05:02.587
J“ Ooh, ooh

05:03.888 --> 05:07.801
J‘ Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh J‘

05:07.808 --> 05:09.719
J“ Ooh, ooh

05:11.854 --> 05:13.640
— No one's taking Johnny
anywhere.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.807
- Just doing my job.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.146
Black Warrant
came through Banyon.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.640
Take it up with her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.902
Cool your assholes.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.609
As ranking officer, I order you

05:20.613 --> 05:22.820
to lower your God damn weapons.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.951
J‘J‘

05:28.954 --> 05:30.660
- What about them?
- We never listen to him.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.074
- Dutch...
- Johnny was gone for months,

05:32.082 --> 05:35.620
and the Nine didn't say shit
about Delle Seyah.

05:35.628 --> 05:38.165
Why get a Warrant now?
- It's a mistake, obviously.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.083
Little Jaqobis would never
kill a Niner.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.705
He's the smart one.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.049
- Yeah, Johnny, tell them.

05:47.139 --> 05:50.347
- The Warrant's legit?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.967
- Now that we all agree...

05:56.816 --> 05:59.182
- No kill shots
till we sort this out!

05:59.193 --> 06:01.730
J‘J‘

06:01.737 --> 06:04.069
- Should I turn myself in?
- Shut up and shoot.

06:11.831 --> 06:13.696
-Aah!

06:13.707 --> 06:15.243
J‘J‘

06:15.251 --> 06:16.661
- Shit!

06:17.962 --> 06:19.702
I thought you took no sides!

06:19.713 --> 06:21.214
I also take no shit!

06:21.215 --> 06:23.080
- Black Warrants
are open Warrants.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.957
They're just gonna keep coming.
- You called it, sugar cheeks.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.709
Remote cams show more
on the way.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.756
- Come on.
D'av'll have to catch up.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.629
Keep 'em busy, D'av.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.682
Be a lamb and lock up?

06:40.693 --> 06:43.059
- You're coming back, though,
right?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.981
Right?

06:44.989 --> 06:47.446
- How many behind us, Luce?
- Three speeders closing in,

06:47.449 --> 06:49.030
and four registered
Killjoy ships

06:49.034 --> 06:51.696
just entered
Westerley's atmosphere.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.069
- If we want to get ahead
of the wolf pack,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.866
| suggest we scooch.

06:54.874 --> 06:56.080
Yesterday.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.620
- Scooching.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.665
- Who wants my brother?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.412
- Well above my pay grade,
buddy.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.880
Aah!

07:08.220 --> 07:10.131
- D'av, Lucy's got
too many admirers.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.800
You need to hitch a ride
with Turin.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.799
- Send me coordinates
as soon as you've got them.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.801
Drop your guns!
-Aah!

07:22.818 --> 07:24.934
Come on, Jaqobis.
Killjoy to Killjoy.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.776
You really gonna shoot
a brother of the badge?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.281
- | only have one brother.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.240
-Aah!

07:31.243 --> 07:34.781
- Huh?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.164
- When I catch those little
ass nuggets,

07:36.165 --> 07:38.497
I'm gonna peel
their balls like grapes.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.038
- You know, that's really
violent imagery, man.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.331
- Shut up, hippie.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.125
- All their weapons
were on "stun."

07:45.132 --> 07:47.248
- No one uses "stun"
for a Black Warrant.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.045
- Stun.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.293
-Aah!

07:50.304 --> 07:52.169
Oh.
I'm okay!

07:52.181 --> 07:53.921
- The Warrant's to capture
Johnny, not kill him.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.798
They want him alive.
- Then things are looking up.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.936
- I'm just gonna rest for a bit.
-Ass-up, but up.

07:57.937 --> 08:01.304
- Up?
We were completely blindsided.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.977
How could you now know there was
a Warrant on one of your own?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.849
- How could you not know
your brother killed Delle Seyah?

08:05.861 --> 08:09.274
- If he did,
it was in self-defense.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.897
Johnny wouldn't murder anyone.
He doesn't have it in him.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.867
- Go to Banyon,
find a way to fix this.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.861
But her icing me out means
she doesn't trust me

08:16.872 --> 08:18.863
any more than I trust her,
and we still don't know

08:18.874 --> 08:20.785
whether she's playing
for the Hullen.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.078
- What do we do with him?

08:22.086 --> 08:23.792
- He a bleeder?

08:23.796 --> 08:25.161
Dump him somewhere.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.833
Can't lock up a Killjoy
on a legal warrant.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.046
Draw too much attention.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.756
- But he'll go
straight after Johnny.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.216
- Furry Jaqobis'll be fine.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.802
He's got Dutch and a whole
galaxy to hide in.

08:33.806 --> 08:34.921
But it ain't gonna
change the fact

08:34.932 --> 08:36.217
that he killed a God damn Niner.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.341
- Delle Seyah Kendry is
a traitor and a murderer.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.310
If he did kill her,

08:41.313 --> 08:44.100
he should get a God damn medal.

08:44.108 --> 08:46.190
l'll head for Borian's Belt.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.149
The asteroids should
buy us some cover.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.235
- What is it with you
and asteroids?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.855
- They're hard
and full of secrets.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.527
Like you.
- Secrets.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.278
Like how you forgot to tell us
you're wanted for murder?

08:58.288 --> 09:00.370
Delle Seyah was one of
the Nine, John.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.286
Live or dead,
she still has allies.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.085
- What is it?

09:07.089 --> 09:08.920
- The green is
a living repository

09:08.924 --> 09:11.836
for our collective
Hullen memories.

09:11.844 --> 09:15.962
We transfer all our experiences,
all our knowledge into it.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.929
What's the point of eternal life

09:17.933 --> 09:20.800
if you can't remember
all you've lived?

09:20.811 --> 09:24.929
- Sounds like a living
data cloud.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.056
Or a biocomputer.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.398
- Poor bunny.

09:28.402 --> 09:32.941
Your mind is still
so adorably human.

09:32.948 --> 09:36.111
Don't worry.
That will fade.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.282
- Show me how it works.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.084
- Slowly.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.926
It can be overwhelming.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.191
Ah.

10:12.196 --> 10:16.109
Whoa.
What was that?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.822
- The beginning.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.206
- We've still got a tail loose.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.947
- The field's magnetic
interference

10:24.958 --> 10:26.334
is masking our ionic signature.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.166
We appear to have shaken them
for now.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.456
- Speak up if you detect
any ships coming into range.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.080
- I'm detecting a range of
emotion in your voice, John.

10:33.092 --> 10:35.959
Do you require a tissue?
- I'm good, girl.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.927
Just kicking myself
for coming back.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.922
- Why didn't you tell us
about Delle Seyah?

10:40.933 --> 10:42.969
— The Nine go pretty hard
for revenge porn.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.637
I didn't want you or D'av
playing a starring role.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.977
- But you should have
come to us.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.311
Before you killed her.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.182
- I didn't want you to stop me.
I wanted her dead.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.188
I'm not sorry, Dutch.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.360
Maybe I should be, but I'm not.

11:02.121 --> 11:05.238
You can't protect me
from every punch.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.786
Even though you keep trying.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.205
- Magnetic storm's rolling in.

11:11.213 --> 11:14.455
| suggest we not be near any
big, floaty rocks when she hits.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.002
- We're still safer in here

11:16.009 --> 11:18.500
as long as that Warrant
is still active.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.003
- John needs a place to lay low.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.675
You need recruits for our war.

11:22.683 --> 11:28.394
What if I can work a little
two-for—one special?

11:28.397 --> 11:31.355
You are so lucky
I hopped this train.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.354
- I don't care what Turin says.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.352
He's talking before
he's walking.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.113
-Aah!

11:40.117 --> 11:41.527
What the...
- Hey, buddy.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.026
How you feeling?
- Upside-downy.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.993
- How about telling me where
you were taking my brother?

11:45.998 --> 11:49.161
- How about shoving a knuckle
wrench up your butt?

11:49.168 --> 11:50.123
Aah!

11:51.503 --> 11:53.334
I apologize.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.044
- We'll try that again.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.504
Where were you taking Johnny?

11:56.508 --> 11:58.044
- I don't know...

11:59.970 --> 12:02.256
Okay, orders are
to get him in cryo

12:02.264 --> 12:04.380
and wait for
extraction coordinates.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.473
- Why cryo?
- Because wherever they're

12:06.476 --> 12:09.013
taking him, it sure as hells
ain't a day trip.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.386
- Well, Johnny's way off
the grid by now.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.262
Good luck finding him.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.772
- So no pool where we're going?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.270
- Ohron's more of an ice rink
kind of moon.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.147
- Ohron?

12:23.452 --> 12:25.534
No way.
- All the way, baby.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.778
- Uh, what way
are we talking about?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.450
- Ohron is home of the Ferran,
the most badass

12:29.458 --> 12:31.323
outlaw mercenaries in the J.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.202
How do you not know this?
- Because I grew up

12:34.213 --> 12:36.169
a slave princess in a harem,
and you grew up

12:36.173 --> 12:38.289
reading comic books
and building robot dogs.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.336
- Solid point,
but wait... wait a minute.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.461
Only the Ferran
know Ohron's location.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.178
How in the hells did you get it?

12:45.182 --> 12:48.299
- I may have kinda run with them
for a bit.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.471
But people get so shady when
you say you're ex-Ferran.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.265
- Won't the old gang
be a bit pissed

12:52.272 --> 12:54.433
that you've given up
their secret base?

12:54.441 --> 12:57.183
- Family forgives... right?

13:06.036 --> 13:08.322
- I hope Pree didn't grow
his hair out for nothing.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.571
- It's all about
making an entrance.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.493
J‘J‘

13:12.501 --> 13:15.789
- Blond?
Did not see that coming.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.502
The man is a cave of wonders.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.337
- Flare shot.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.603
The beacon is lit.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.473
- The Johnny is impressed.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.100
- How long do we wait for?

13:40.112 --> 13:43.149
- Oh, honey bun.
They're already here.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.822
- Particle displacement shield.
Nice.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.536
So great to meet you guys.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.703
Huge fans.
Huge.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.372
- I come claiming sanctuary.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.540
- Who makes the claim?

13:59.548 --> 14:01.584
- Prima Dezz.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.333
Who you knew as Varrick.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.426
- Varrick?
Both: Varrick?

14:06.430 --> 14:09.593
- Does "Prima Dezz" sound
like a warlord to you?

14:12.144 --> 14:14.135
- Close family.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.351
You haven't changed.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.196
You raging meat stick.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.155
- Well, Pree definitely
has a type.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.864
- You got balls of buckshot
coming back here, Varrick.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.160
- You used to like that
about me.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.251
- You swore to lead us
until death.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.336
- You led the Ferran?

14:41.340 --> 14:43.331
- Teensy bit.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.333
Varrick swore to lead you.

14:45.344 --> 14:49.303
And Varrick died
during the Jasper raids.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.093
Prima Dezz hopped a freighter
to Westerley.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.715
- If it was all lies,
you're dumber

14:53.727 --> 14:55.888
than I thought coming back here.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.852
You know the price of betrayal.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.189
- l risked it
to help save a good man.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.104
Like I did once for you,
Lachlan.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.818
- This the man?
- Yeah, but we're not...

15:05.822 --> 15:07.232
We're not, like, together.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.820
- Johnny's being hunted.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.489
Like you all once were.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.783
Accuse me of whatever you want.

15:15.791 --> 15:19.124
But deny him, and you betray
everything the Ferran believe.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.412
- What about her?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.456
- We're a package deal.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.956
We're prepared to pay our keep.

15:25.967 --> 15:30.210
- The finest weaponry
money can't buy.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.837
- It's not enough.
- What?

15:31.848 --> 15:35.432
Do you know what you can get for
a double-cannon Nitrobarken?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.300
It's not even legal
in half the J.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.974
- What do you want, Lachlan?

15:39.981 --> 15:44.190
- Your life for their safety
will do just fine.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.871
- Drag a comb through that nest.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.535
Do us all a favor.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.250
- I should have been told there
was a Black Warrant on Jaqobis.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.540
-And if I had,
Johnny Jaqobis would have ran,

16:04.548 --> 16:06.413
and been right back
up on that wall.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.007
Magically slipped through
our fingers again.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.342
- Internal Affairs
isn't your damn job.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.382
- You couldn't do my job.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.926
That's why I'm here.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.845
Oh, and | read your files on
"Team Awesome Force."

16:17.853 --> 16:20.219
Sweetest hate letter
ever written.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.812
But even with them breaking
every God damn rule,

16:22.816 --> 16:24.181
none of it ever sticks.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.023
- Got a point,
or are we just talking dirty?

16:26.027 --> 16:27.563
- Why are you protecting them,
Turin?

16:27.571 --> 16:29.903
- If they swore an oath,
I got their back.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.192
Even the assholes
get a fair shake.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.577
That's the way I lead.
- And that's why you'll fall.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.240
Jaqobis killed Delle Seyah.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.112
Here's your proof.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.877
- Where's the rest
of the footage?

16:49.885 --> 16:53.218
- That's all Turin sent from
the old Company street cams.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.923
— He shot her in the gut,
not the head.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.016
- You think she survived?
- No state funeral.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.477
No backstabbing to replace her.

17:02.481 --> 17:05.063
It's a pretty quiet exit for
a drama queen like Delle Seyah.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.603
- Well, maybe there's something
in the alley-cam archives.

17:07.611 --> 17:10.227
- Pree has alley-cams?

17:10.238 --> 17:13.150
Oh, bless his little
voyeur heart.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.318
- Why would you bring us here

17:18.330 --> 17:20.070
if your ex was gonna kill you?

17:20.081 --> 17:22.333
- Lachlan used to find me
very charming.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.325
So what happened to you guys?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.624
Oh, you know: Boy meets boy,
they fall in love,

17:27.631 --> 17:30.498
it's all sunsets and fireworks
until it isn't.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.340
- How long since
you ran out on him?

17:32.344 --> 17:36.587
- Long enough to imagine all the
ways to make me suffer for it.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.465
But whatever our history,

17:39.476 --> 17:41.307
Lachlan's a man of his word.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.973
The Ferran will protect Johnny.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.516
Now, the two of you need to
figure out a way

17:45.524 --> 17:47.355
to save my sweet tush.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.599
- What you said before,

17:48.610 --> 17:51.067
about the Ferran being hunted?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.653
- The Ferran are all refugee
soldiers from corrupt wars.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.318
- You mean deserters.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.533
- Ah-ah,
conscientious deserters.

17:58.537 --> 18:01.074
- The Ferran believe
a true soldier risks his life

18:01.081 --> 18:03.948
for more than corporate
or feudal interests.

18:03.959 --> 18:07.827
- Like, say,
saving an entire human race?

18:09.548 --> 18:12.665
- Whatever you're gonna do, make
sure Lachlan eats first.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.463
He's a real bear when
his blood sugar crashes.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.133
Do not poke the bear.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.007
- Cramming for exams?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.009
- Standing contract on Muvallah.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.557
I've already sent
half my people.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.430
How are you
at running campaigns?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.397
- I'm more of a "mission" girl.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.984
- Killjoy, right.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.649
I know why you're here,

18:34.656 --> 18:37.113
but Varrick broke our laws.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.073
I couldn't save him
if I wanted to.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.033
- But if all the Ferran
are deserters,

18:41.037 --> 18:42.538
how is what Pree did
any different?

18:42.539 --> 18:45.121
- The Ferran fight
for two things:

18:45.125 --> 18:47.958
Just wars and each other.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.953
Pree betrayed both when he
hopped a freighter to Westerley.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.080
- Pree risked his life
for Old Town

18:53.091 --> 18:55.002
when the Company
bombed it to shit.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.625
That is not a man who ran
out on honor.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.673
- He abandoned his post.
- He abandoned you.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.717
Isn't that what
this is really about?

19:01.725 --> 19:03.431
- Careful.
- I don't have time

19:03.435 --> 19:05.721
to be careful.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.765
The war Pree and l
are getting ready to fight

19:07.772 --> 19:10.730
will shake the entire J.

19:10.734 --> 19:14.067
Free him.
Join us.

19:14.070 --> 19:18.063
It will be the Ferran's
most righteous fight yet.

19:18.074 --> 19:22.443
'Cause if the Hullen win,
everything you fight for dies.

19:22.454 --> 19:26.743
Justice, freedom, honor.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.412
- Now, what would a Killjoy
know about honor?

19:29.419 --> 19:32.752
- I know that
you are killing a good man

19:32.756 --> 19:36.499
because of a broken heart.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.670
Where's the honor in that?

19:46.436 --> 19:50.099
- Sorry about
shooting you before.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.188
It's not cool.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.399
- Happens all the time.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.233
I got that kind of face.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.398
- Pree seems to like it.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.196
Are you and Pree...
- Hells if I know.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.694
Man's locked up tighter
than a Niner's asshole.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.206
- Yeah, well,
Johnny forgot to mention

20:07.207 --> 20:10.074
that he murdered
the Queen of the Quad.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.455
Both: Dudes...

20:13.463 --> 20:15.044
- Oh, here we go.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.638
- Always double tap, Johnny.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.431
- Well, at least now
you got proof.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.644
You gonna send it to Turin?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.264
- No.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.687
This calls for
a personal delivery.

20:45.829 --> 20:48.161
- I've made my decision.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.155
You'll be tried by proxy.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.703
Two champions competing,
one for Pree's life...

20:52.711 --> 20:55.498
- Dutch.
I choose Dutch.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.166
Sorry, Pumpkin.
-Ah...

20:57.173 --> 21:00.165
— The other for an alliance
with the Ferran

21:00.176 --> 21:01.677
against the Hullen...
- Son of a bitch.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.839
- And on trial for the Ferran...
- Don't do it...

21:03.847 --> 21:07.590
- Will be John Jaqobis.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.468
Our friend's life or the lives
of the entire J.

21:11.479 --> 21:15.813
Let your honor decide which is
the worthier fight.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.151
- Well, then.
You poked the bear, didn't you?

21:31.958 --> 21:35.121
- Each champion must undergo
three trials:

21:35.128 --> 21:37.460
Strength of body,

21:37.464 --> 21:41.707
mind, and spirit.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.674
May their honor lead them
to victory.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.802
- My honor's feeling
a bit drafty.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.800
— First to cut the sigil
from their opponent

21:51.811 --> 21:55.724
without drawing blood
takes the challenge.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.148
Trial begins.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.903
- So how we doing this?
- Carefully.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.147
I don't want to accidentally
hurt you.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.898
Make it look good when you lose.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.117
- Whoa, hang on.
You think that I can't win?

22:12.499 --> 22:15.161
Uh-oh.
Got one.

22:15.168 --> 22:19.252
- Careful, we're fighting
for Pree's life.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.836
- You don't have to win...

22:20.840 --> 22:21.955
All three.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.797
Aah!

22:23.802 --> 22:25.212
This one's mine.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.970
- What the hells?
What are you doing?

22:32.977 --> 22:35.468
- I'm just putting on
a good show.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.265
- First trial is over!

22:40.276 --> 22:43.109
- Oh, shit, did I... win?

22:46.115 --> 22:47.946
- Not even close.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.909
You may be Level V,
but I trained for Vl.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.909
- But you have proof
Delle Seyah is alive.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.037
- We take Warrants,
Jaqobis, not sides.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.209
- The Warrant is bullshit.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.092
— Why?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.552
So he didn't kill her then.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.968
Prove he didn't kill her later.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.931
Or is this home movie
all you've got?

23:13.935 --> 23:16.927
- Delle Seyah is behind this.
John is being set up.

23:16.938 --> 23:19.930
If you want to, you could
challenge the Warrant.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.306
- You want me to challenge
this Warrant?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.979
Drag her highness in here
by the hair.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.979
Prove she's still alive.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.858
Until then, get the hells
out of my office.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.292
- First to shoot the target

23:41.296 --> 23:43.332
takes the challenge of the mind.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.920
- Pretty simple.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.836
So where does
the mind part come in?

23:52.432 --> 23:54.047
- Oh.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.976
- Gotcha.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.393
- Begin.

24:06.404 --> 24:09.146
- 50 joy says I smoke your ass.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.239
- 100 says you eat that.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.951
- Oh, it is on.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.457
Yes.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.119
- Eat it, Jaqobis...

24:26.382 --> 24:29.294
- I'm sorry, eat what?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.964
Is the answer my dick?

24:36.935 --> 24:38.471
- Khlyen's mystery box can wait.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.311
Johnny killed Delle Seyah
and now she's after him.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.896
- Not sure that makes sense.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.232
- Baroness von Batshit's
gone full Hullen.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.100
Hmm.
- Oh, now that makes sense.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.899
- Somehow she,
or whoever's helping her,

24:50.907 --> 24:52.989
ordered a Black Warrant
on Johnny.

24:52.992 --> 24:57.952
If we can find her, we've got
a shot at shutting it down.

24:57.956 --> 25:01.448
| used the green goo to connect
to the Hullen's memory before.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.165
Maybe I can do the same thing

25:03.169 --> 25:06.161
now that Delle Seyah's
on the juice.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.215
This is for science, remember?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.678
- | read John's research.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.219
When the Hullen connect
to the plasma,

25:18.226 --> 25:20.217
there is a surge

25:20.228 --> 25:23.061
of electrical activity
in the hippocampus.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.100
We'll try and match
their brain's

25:25.108 --> 25:27.315
electrical activity
by amping yours up.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.192
Okay.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.989
It's neverjust beer
and fritters.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.284
- Ready?

25:47.296 --> 25:48.376
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.872
Aah!

25:53.428 --> 25:55.089
- Anything?

25:55.096 --> 25:56.381
- A hemorrhage.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.469
- So not that.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.560
Nerds.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.018
- Final challenges
tests the spirit.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.104
- Chains, leather, blindfolds.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.063
Do we need your safe word?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.274
- We're all chained
by something.

26:10.278 --> 26:13.065
This will help you see by what.

26:16.159 --> 26:22.029
J‘J‘

26:22.040 --> 26:25.908
First one to free themselves...
wins.

26:29.047 --> 26:31.959
— Remember, Johnny.
It's for Pree.

26:33.551 --> 26:36.167
We're even now.
This one's mine, okay?

26:36.179 --> 26:38.044
- Got it, boss.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.421
- Ooh.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.423
Why are my eyes vomiting?

26:47.273 --> 26:48.774
The drink.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.391
We must be tripping
our balls off.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.438
J‘J‘

26:53.446 --> 26:56.279
Uh-oh.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.193
There's no more walls
for you to hide behind.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.316
What is up with you?

26:59.327 --> 27:01.067
I've been sensing this hot whiff

27:01.079 --> 27:02.615
of bitchery from you all day.

27:02.622 --> 27:06.615
- I know that you blocked Turin
from giving me my Level V.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.498
That should have stayed
in my head.

27:11.506 --> 27:13.246
Oh, shit.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.168
I think we've been dosed
with Truth Jakk.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.461
- Truth Jakk?
Really?

27:16.469 --> 27:17.584
- Your hair is too big
for your face,

27:17.595 --> 27:19.051
you leave knives everywhere,

27:19.055 --> 27:20.135
and your pottery's terrible.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.299
- Okay, okay, okay.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.296
The truth sets you free.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.173
| get it.

27:24.185 --> 27:27.427
Look, blocking your Level V was
a shitty thing to do.

27:27.438 --> 27:29.224
But I did it to protect you.
You weren't ready.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.642
- I'm pretty sure
that's not your choice.

27:30.650 --> 27:34.313
- Level Vs are cleared
for Kill Warrants.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.652
Cold-blooded executions.
That's not you, Johnny.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.648
- I put a bullet in Delle Seyah.
That was me.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.445
-And you couldn't handle it.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.613
You ran away with Clara
to play house.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.282
You know,
Lucy sulked for months.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.825
- I took a little space because

27:46.833 --> 27:48.494
my girlfriend is murdered,
and you're inviting

27:48.501 --> 27:50.366
baby nerds onto our ship.

27:50.378 --> 27:51.584
- What, Zeph?

27:51.587 --> 27:54.124
We needed her help.
You were gone.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.212
- l was gonna come back.

27:55.216 --> 27:57.207
- I didn't want you to.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.435
You know, when | first met you,

28:09.438 --> 28:13.147
you were Johnny Jaqobis.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.393
Lover of ponies,
sunshine optimist.

28:18.281 --> 28:21.614
You weren't a murderer.

28:21.617 --> 28:25.451
And I won't watch you
turn into me.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.582
- Who I am...

28:28.583 --> 28:31.165
has nothing to do with you.

28:31.169 --> 28:33.285
I am not the angel
on your shoulder.

28:33.296 --> 28:36.254
It is not my job to stop you
from going full Khlyen

28:36.257 --> 28:38.293
and murdering everyone
that gets in your way.

28:38.301 --> 28:42.294
You could stop yourself,
but you don't want to,

28:46.434 --> 28:50.177
And I know that that's what
this war is all about for you.

28:50.188 --> 28:51.428
It's not about saving the J.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.270
It's not about killing
the Hullen.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.889
You want to destroy Aneela

28:54.901 --> 29:00.237
to prove to dead Daddy K that
you are better than her.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.652
- Well, I am.
And I'm gonna win.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.275
- They have more ships,
they have more guns,

29:06.287 --> 29:10.200
and they can turn every one
of us into one of them.

29:12.627 --> 29:16.245
We can't win this, Dutch.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.418
- Then why did you come back?

29:23.387 --> 29:24.672
- Uh...

29:24.680 --> 29:26.545
where's all this smoke
coming from?

29:45.326 --> 29:49.239
- Whoo! Smells like a sad
drum circle in here.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.449
Balls.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.077
Guess it's buy one,
get one free.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.093
We done?
Did we win?

30:09.100 --> 30:10.806
Where in the hells are we?

30:10.810 --> 30:13.392
- Our comms are jammed,
we're heavily restrained...

30:13.396 --> 30:15.307
In shit, I'd say.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.641
- Did we break up back there?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.392
Kind of felt like we broke up.

30:21.404 --> 30:23.736
- Look, you wanted space.
I gave you space.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.151
- I was talking "actual space"
space.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.285
Not between us.

30:28.286 --> 30:33.246
- You know, it's really hard
when Mommy and Daddy fight.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.125
What happened?

30:42.133 --> 30:44.795
Where are Dutch and John?

30:44.802 --> 30:47.168
You promised to protect them.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.465
- Trial is forfeit.
It's not our problem anymore.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.681
- Oh, I'm about to
give your ass one.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.224
I want you to listen real close,
lover boy.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.271
Skipping out on you?
Real dick move.

31:03.279 --> 31:06.191
And I'm sorry for it.
Very, very sorry.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.985
- I don't care anymore.

31:12.163 --> 31:13.369
But I did.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.825
I would have died for you,
Varrick.

31:18.836 --> 31:21.452
- I know.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.455
That's why I left.

31:23.466 --> 31:27.459
You were born to lead
the Ferran.

31:27.470 --> 31:30.303
But the only way
to take that place

31:30.306 --> 31:34.174
was for me to die.

31:34.185 --> 31:36.426
One commander falls...

31:36.437 --> 31:38.473
- Another rises.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.223
- Ferran law.

31:45.154 --> 31:48.362
I left because you started

31:48.366 --> 31:52.325
risking your life
to protect mine.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.910
I wasn't gonna let you die.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.281
Not for me.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.333
For what it's worth,

32:04.340 --> 32:09.209
leaving you burned a hole
in my heart.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.835
- Good.

32:17.395 --> 32:19.056
- So...

32:20.898 --> 32:22.513
You gonna forgive
my gorgeous ass

32:22.525 --> 32:24.811
so we can save my friends?

32:26.821 --> 32:28.527
- These puppies emit 300 volts

32:28.531 --> 32:31.864
if you step outside my drop pod.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.405
No one wants to pass out
in the middle of an icy moon.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.404
Hypothermia and all.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.155
- How did you find us?

32:39.166 --> 32:42.158
- Because I'm amazing.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.376
- You put a tracker
in my shot glass.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.918
Because I'm amazing.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.381
Now say your good-byes
while I prepare

32:49.385 --> 32:52.252
the cryo-pod for one
Jaqobis popsicle.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.924
Back in a jiff.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.852
- Hey.
- Hmm?

33:11.282 --> 33:13.398
- Do you know what? Maybe
we're not even really here.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.572
Maybe we're still trapped
on that Ferran drugathon.

33:16.579 --> 33:17.944
Aah.
- You think so?

33:17.955 --> 33:19.240
- Ow.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.909
Brat.
- You love it.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.293
- Yeah, I do.
You're all grown up now.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.875
Revenge killing like a big boy.

33:24.879 --> 33:28.588
- I'm still me, Dutch, with just
a hint of mad pirate.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.331
Because that's what
the ladies like.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.593
- You know,
I never wanted you gone.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.550
ljust wanted you to be safe.

33:33.554 --> 33:36.466
- When did we ever play it safe?

33:36.474 --> 33:39.056
- Do you really think
we're gonna lose this war?

33:39.059 --> 33:41.516
- Well, the numbers suck.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.853
But if there is a way, my bones
tell me it's following you.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.227
And that is why I came back.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.567
- You know, I would have picked
that lock in half the time.

33:50.571 --> 33:53.278
- Brat.
- You love it.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.986
Aah!

34:00.998 --> 34:02.534
- Oh, don't look so grouchy.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.577
I said "a jiff."

34:04.585 --> 34:06.826
Time to put Jaqobis on ice.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.459
Cocoa?

34:11.467 --> 34:13.503
That's how you apologize to me
for nearly frying my brain?

34:13.511 --> 34:14.626
- Steeped Makha root.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.628
Natural opioid
and mild hallucinogen.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.971
-Ah, you want me to get high.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.510
- Meditation and hallucinogens
can access

34:20.518 --> 34:22.474
parts of the brain
we normally can't.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.890
Instead of forcing a connection,

34:24.897 --> 34:27.479
we'll try a gentler way in.

34:29.527 --> 34:33.361
Now, be specific when keying
into Delle Seyah's memories.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.320
Did she wear perfume?

34:35.324 --> 34:38.316
Smell is one of the most
powerful memory triggers.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.612
- You want me to get high
and sniff her panties?

34:41.497 --> 34:45.206
- We really need to work on
the whole joke thing.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.409
Cheers.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.462
Ugh...

35:01.433 --> 35:03.424
- Picture Delle Seyah
in your mind.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.596
Listen to the rhythm.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.014
Close your eyes.

35:17.324 --> 35:21.317
- I can hear you mouth-breathing
from here.

35:29.587 --> 35:33.876
- I'm almost used to
your creepy little lurk.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.713
-Ah...

35:35.718 --> 35:37.754
- How are you lessons coming?

35:37.761 --> 35:41.504
I hear the commander is
teaching you the green.

35:41.515 --> 35:42.971
- I've always been
a quick study.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.931
- Then you know there are
no secrets from it.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.517
After advising the Admiral,
she agreed to call off

35:47.521 --> 35:48.977
the Warrant for your Killjoy.

35:48.981 --> 35:51.597
It risked exposing us.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.099
We don't want a repeat of Arkyn.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.647
- And you skipped all the way
here to tell me, didn't you?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.110
- You're Hullen now.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.651
Your old human vendettas
are beneath you.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.900
- I thought you didn't think
much was beneath me.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.651
- Hm.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.075
| always forget
how young you are.

36:07.082 --> 36:10.916
It takes time
to accept the change.

36:10.919 --> 36:14.161
But... a word of caution:

36:14.173 --> 36:16.789
If you feel the commander's
affections allow you

36:16.800 --> 36:20.042
to do as you please...

36:20.054 --> 36:24.798
Aneela always tires of her toys.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.720
And then she breaks them.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.684
- I'll unjam your ship's comms

36:37.696 --> 36:39.072
as soon as I'm out of orbit.

36:39.073 --> 36:40.609
Promise.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.817
Anything else you need?

36:44.828 --> 36:46.989
We want your stay with us
to be comfortable.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.578
- Awkward request then?

36:48.582 --> 36:51.824
- Yes, I am free
for drinks next week.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.211
- Itch I can't scratch.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.079
Be a lad and help a girl out.

36:56.090 --> 36:58.206
- See, now it feels like
that's gonna start

36:58.217 --> 37:00.708
with a back rub
and end in a headlock.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.836
- Busted.
You really are amazing.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.054
Water instead, then, please.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.719
- That I can do.

37:15.109 --> 37:17.100
- Thanks.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.602
- Thirsty kitten.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.652
-Ah.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.197
- Oh, balls!
Wha...

37:27.204 --> 37:29.195
Wha... what did you do
to my eyes?

37:31.709 --> 37:33.870
- Nerve gas implants.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.869
Add water...

37:36.880 --> 37:38.620
then bite.

37:40.634 --> 37:41.794
Johnny!

37:45.639 --> 37:46.879
Johnny, you're okay.

37:46.890 --> 37:50.803
- They all look like angels
when they sleep.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.096
Cavalry's here.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.640
- You're late.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.933
- Oh.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.852
Oh.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.905
- Wake him when he's near
a hot shower.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.284
- I'm cold, I'm tired,

38:09.288 --> 38:12.155
and I'm not making
smart choices.

38:12.166 --> 38:16.159
So if I shoot you,
do | get to be boss, or Pree?

38:16.170 --> 38:18.035
- Lachlan's already onside.

38:18.046 --> 38:22.085
- When the Hullen come,
the Ferran will answer.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.707
- No.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.675
No, not if it means that
Pree has to die

38:25.679 --> 38:27.089
on this cold sore of a moon.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.304
- Pree's free to go.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.766
Varrick paid the Ferran price.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.306
- I had to put out.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.304
A lot.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.770
Thank you.

38:45.199 --> 38:46.985
Guess this is, uh...

38:58.712 --> 39:01.795
Guess it's never really over
until you bang your ex, right?

39:09.014 --> 39:11.300
- Why did you let Gander
call off the warrant?

39:11.308 --> 39:12.764
Her team is Dutch's
one weakness.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.760
I wanted Jaqobis brought here.

39:15.771 --> 39:18.808
- Who are you?

39:18.816 --> 39:20.226
- Aneela?

39:20.234 --> 39:22.850
Are you all right?

39:22.861 --> 39:26.103
- You see me?

39:26.114 --> 39:27.945
- Aneela?

39:27.950 --> 39:30.908
- What did Daddy do to you?

39:30.911 --> 39:33.197
- You're the same.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.867
You're exactly the same.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.865
- Tell her I'll see her soon.

39:45.968 --> 39:48.584
- Turin's confirmed it.
The warrant's off.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.847
- Praise the trees.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.759
What's the ETA
on Sleeping Beauty?

39:52.766 --> 39:54.006
-Any minute.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.678
- That calls for a drink.

39:55.686 --> 39:58.849
- Uh, my ship, my bar.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.767
Barstool privilege.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.358
It's nice to see
Lachlan and you made up.

40:05.362 --> 40:08.695
- We made out.
Not the same.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.735
- A kiss for an army.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.868
Not a bad trade.

40:11.869 --> 40:13.985
- They say "Make love, not war."

40:13.996 --> 40:16.362
I say why choose?

40:18.458 --> 40:19.914
Thank you.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.874
For saving my life.

40:23.297 --> 40:24.878
- The way that man kissed you,

40:24.882 --> 40:27.464
he was never gonna kill you.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.719
So what do you think's next?

40:29.720 --> 40:31.381
Invite him home?
Meet the parents?

40:31.388 --> 40:33.470
- We tried playing house,
but Lachlan's happiest

40:33.473 --> 40:35.759
when he's bashing skulls
forjustice.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.725
And you know me,
I do not come second.

40:38.729 --> 40:42.062
- I think you might come first
in Gared's books.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.647
- We'll see if he survives
basic training.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.061
-Ah...

40:46.069 --> 40:48.321
- Oh, it stirs.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.732
-Ah...

40:52.743 --> 40:55.075
- Hey.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.693
- Oh, Dutch...

40:56.705 --> 40:58.445
- Did you sleep well?

40:58.457 --> 40:59.947
-Ah...
- Good.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.823
Welcome to Level V.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.000
Ah...

41:04.004 --> 41:05.915
- No more pulling punches.

41:05.923 --> 41:08.630
-Ah...
- Tap my heart.

41:31.448 --> 41:34.064
- J‘ Grow my wings like
a butterfly J‘

41:50.384 --> 41:51.840
- And she saw you?

41:51.843 --> 41:54.755
- Just like Khlyen when
l was in his memory.

41:54.763 --> 41:58.756
Only it was... Aneela's, I think.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.052
- What was she like?

42:00.060 --> 42:02.893
- Powerful.

42:02.896 --> 42:04.636
Possibly bonkers.

42:06.108 --> 42:07.814
- She's coming for you, Dutch.

42:07.818 --> 42:08.933
- Good.

42:08.944 --> 42:11.401
Solves the shit out of
finding her.

42:11.405 --> 42:12.394
- Hmm.

42:12.406 --> 42:13.771
- She's not alone.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.028
Delle Seyah's with her.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.451
John, she's Hullen.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.540
You didn't kill her.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.078
- I'm ready for round two
if she is.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.955
- I've been on their ship.
It's a God damn city.

42:31.967 --> 42:33.832
We are gonna need
serious backup.

42:33.844 --> 42:36.005
- It's time we take
what's ours back.

42:36.013 --> 42:38.971
RAC by RAC, one by one,
starting with our own.

42:38.974 --> 42:40.089
- You talking bug hunt?

42:40.100 --> 42:42.807
- I'm talking
God damn revolution.

42:42.811 --> 42:45.974
Time to take back the RAC.

42:45.981 --> 42:48.188
- J‘ Oh, oh, hallelujah J‘

42:48.191 --> 42:50.568
J‘ I climb up through
the trees J‘

42:50.569 --> 42:53.026
J“ I'm strong enough to bleed J‘

42:53.030 --> 42:56.522
J‘ I grow my wings like
a butterfly J‘

42:56.533 --> 42:58.615
J” Well, I sing the hallelujah

42:58.618 --> 43:00.904
I Then I walk out
on the water J‘

43:00.912 --> 43:03.870
J“ I'm not going under J‘
