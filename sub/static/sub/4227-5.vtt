Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.293 --> 00:04.929
We've studied you
in great detail, Professor.

00:04.954 --> 00:07.002
We've drawn from that
to make a proposal

00:07.027 --> 00:09.132
that would end hostilities
between us.

00:09.157 --> 00:10.823
That's why we'll never stop
fighting you.

00:10.848 --> 00:12.237
In the harnessing
facility...

00:12.262 --> 00:13.719
I saw your spikes glow.

00:13.744 --> 00:15.092
I want the harness back.

00:15.117 --> 00:16.852
Come with me.
We'll find them.

00:16.877 --> 00:17.884
We'll find them together.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.997
Well, what if it wasn't something
physical but psychological?

00:20.022 --> 00:22.264
Just like there's no way to know
what's going on inside of me.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.199
I heard they pulled a
circuit board out of Tom's head.

00:25.423 --> 00:26.765
We don't know what it is.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.668
I'll decide
who I can trust.

01:33.835 --> 01:37.906
I can hear you,
you know?

01:37.974 --> 01:42.479
Ah, yeah, yeah.

01:42.513 --> 01:45.215
You scrape your heels
when you walk.

01:45.249 --> 01:47.517
My mom said
the same thing.

01:47.552 --> 01:50.387
She was right.
I doubt she was giving me pointers

01:50.422 --> 01:52.156
on how to survive
an alien invasion.

01:52.190 --> 01:54.358
Maybe not, but as your partner,
I'm asking you to --

01:54.392 --> 01:56.227
Pick up my feet.

01:56.262 --> 01:58.430
At least when we're on patrol.
Yes, ma'am.

01:58.465 --> 02:01.300
How'd you know I was here,
anyway?

02:01.334 --> 02:03.370
Because you weren't
in your tent,

02:03.404 --> 02:05.272
and this is where you've been
coming almost every morning.

02:05.307 --> 02:08.008
What?

02:08.043 --> 02:10.009
You spying on me
or something?

02:10.044 --> 02:12.413
Not exactly...spying.
I'm just...

02:12.447 --> 02:13.881
Spying.
No.

02:13.915 --> 02:16.050
I'm keeping an eye
on my partner.

02:16.084 --> 02:19.421
Mm-hmm. Whatever you say,
Hal Mason.

02:19.455 --> 02:23.459
Whatever you say.

02:23.493 --> 02:25.094
What's up?

02:25.128 --> 02:28.030
So, Weaver wants us to scout
pharmacies and hospitals.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.899
Dr. Glass
is low on supplies.

02:29.934 --> 02:31.535
Good. Been in Richmond
for a week.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.604
I'm going stir-crazy here.
I could use --

02:37.175 --> 02:39.409
They're coming!
They're coming!

02:39.444 --> 02:41.878
Matt, what's going on?
Don't know!

02:44.916 --> 02:46.417
Orders, sir?
You know the drill --

02:46.451 --> 02:48.286
take the rest of the Berserkers,
get on a flank position.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.555
I'll come find you
after I talk to Weaver.

02:51.590 --> 02:53.891
Slow down.
Sorry, dad.

02:53.926 --> 02:56.428
No, no. It's okay.
Just stay close to me.

02:56.462 --> 02:58.063
Captain?

02:58.097 --> 02:59.497
Sentries spotted Mech fire
about one klick out.

02:59.565 --> 03:00.966
More than that,
we don't know.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.468
Headed our way?
No sign yet,

03:02.502 --> 03:04.236
but we don't want to get caught
with our pants down.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.338
I want all units on
advanced defensive perimeter.

03:06.406 --> 03:08.975
Tom, get your Berserkers
up on point and recon the situation.

03:09.009 --> 03:10.477
Okay. Question.
Make it quick.

03:10.511 --> 03:12.512
Somebody's getting hit,
and they're getting hit hard.

03:12.580 --> 03:15.482
If that's another resistance group,
we should send another unit to assist.

03:15.516 --> 03:18.652
We'd want them
to do the same for us.

03:18.687 --> 03:20.354
Take your Berserkers.

03:20.422 --> 03:22.156
I'll go with Hal and his unit.
We'll flank the area.

03:22.190 --> 03:24.024
We'll suss it out,
but we're not doing anything

03:24.092 --> 03:25.926
to jeopardize the position
of the 2nd Mass.

03:25.961 --> 03:26.994
Okay. Understood.

03:27.028 --> 03:28.295
We move out in 10.
Okay.

03:28.329 --> 03:30.197
Hey, where's Ben?
Thought he was with you.

03:31.366 --> 03:33.935
Matt, you up
to guarding the med bus?

03:33.969 --> 03:35.303
Y-yeah.

03:35.337 --> 03:37.104
Okay. Stand your post.
Keep Dr. Glass safe.

03:37.139 --> 03:39.207
If Ben shows up,
you tell him I said stay put.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.976
Yes, sir -- Dad.

04:23.188 --> 04:26.557
What the hell
happened here?

04:26.591 --> 04:29.159
These some
messed-up aliens.

04:29.193 --> 04:31.161
What do you think,
boss? Hit-and-run attack?

04:31.195 --> 04:32.696
We ever do one
this good?

04:32.731 --> 04:35.532
No. Not really.

04:45.277 --> 04:47.745
No Skitters,
no resistance --

04:47.779 --> 04:50.614
it's like a ghost town
out here.

04:50.682 --> 04:53.617
Let's investigate this mess.
Check for humans.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.119
See if there's anything
we can salvage.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.766
These are all Mech hits.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.634
There's no shell casings
anywhere.

05:11.668 --> 05:14.437
No humans involved in this
at all, looks like.

05:14.471 --> 05:16.439
So these bastards
are shooting each other now?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.475
That'd be different.

05:27.551 --> 05:30.720
Ben? Ben.

05:30.754 --> 05:34.223
Dad! Over here!

05:34.258 --> 05:38.227
Dad, get him off.
Get him off.

05:38.262 --> 05:39.595
Get him off!
Okay.

05:40.664 --> 05:41.831
Okay.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.235
Rick?

05:45.269 --> 05:46.503
It's Rick.

05:46.570 --> 05:47.503
What the hell's
he doing here?

05:47.538 --> 05:49.172
It's Rick!

05:57.310 --> 06:00.087
I removed a huge chunk
of shrapnel from his shoulder.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.350
He bled a lot,
but he's stable.

06:03.410 --> 06:05.645
Thought we'd seen
the last of him.

06:05.679 --> 06:08.314
As soon as he's awake,
give me a call.

06:08.349 --> 06:11.451
So you can do what?
Interrogate him?

06:11.485 --> 06:13.920
Affirmative, Dr. Glass.

06:13.954 --> 06:15.588
Last time, Rick took
everything he knew about us

06:15.623 --> 06:16.923
and gave it to the enemy.

06:16.957 --> 06:18.591
We can't have that
happen again.

06:18.626 --> 06:20.660
He didn't do anything.

06:20.695 --> 06:22.529
They kidnapped him
and put a harness on his back

06:22.563 --> 06:25.666
that made him do things
he would never do otherwise.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.434
They did it, not <i>him.</i>

06:29.504 --> 06:32.239
Point taken.

06:32.274 --> 06:35.642
Just...
please, keep me posted.

06:35.677 --> 06:38.145
Of course.

06:40.548 --> 06:43.484
Are you okay, Captain?

06:43.518 --> 06:45.485
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's nothing.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.988
Can you sit down over here?
I told you, I'm --

06:48.022 --> 06:50.057
Sit down.

06:50.124 --> 06:52.126
Please.

06:57.031 --> 06:58.632
Lourdes, the kit.

07:04.739 --> 07:08.574
Looks like those antibiotics you
gave me are losing the battle.

07:08.609 --> 07:12.041
We can give you
some topical relief at least.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.310
You are one tough lady.
Please.

07:14.344 --> 07:17.412
3-year-olds used to throw up
on my head.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.646
This is nothing.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.154
So, that's --
that's right about there, right?

07:29.256 --> 07:32.658
Hey. Ben show up?
No. Checked all the back roads.

07:32.692 --> 07:34.526
I don't know
where else to look for him.

07:36.429 --> 07:39.164
You got to tell him
what you told me earlier, Hal.

07:39.198 --> 07:40.198
Tell me what?

07:40.233 --> 07:41.566
Tell him.

07:41.601 --> 07:43.335
Tell me what?!
Last week,

07:43.369 --> 07:45.670
at the place -- the harnessing facility...
Yeah?

07:45.705 --> 07:47.672
...Ben's spikes lit up.

07:47.706 --> 07:50.341
Lit up? Wh--
what you do mean, lit up?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.676
They were glowing, like Rick's
this morning, when we found him.

07:52.710 --> 07:56.012
It was like he was making contact
with one of those Skitter harnesses.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.347
And you
didn't you tell me?

07:57.381 --> 07:58.614
He begged me not to.

07:58.682 --> 08:00.216
He felt like everybody
was gonna go crazy,

08:00.250 --> 08:01.350
and so I promised him.

08:01.384 --> 08:03.753
I don't know. I --
all right.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.588
Has it happened before?

08:05.623 --> 08:08.458
I think so, but he wouldn't
tell me anything else.

08:08.526 --> 08:10.594
- I'm sorry. I should have told --
- Yeah, you should have.

08:10.628 --> 08:12.429
Get your unit together.
I'll get the Berserkers.

08:12.463 --> 08:14.397
We'll make one more sweep
of the city.

08:14.431 --> 08:16.566
But Weaver's orders were for us
to go scout pharmacies and hospitals.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.701
Dr. Glass is critically low
on supplies.

08:18.736 --> 08:21.270
Okay. Then I'll trade you
Tector and Crazy Lee for Dai.

08:21.305 --> 08:22.405
He's a better tracker.

08:23.774 --> 08:24.469
Sure.

08:24.494 --> 08:26.322
Keep your eyes peeled
for any signs of your brother.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.444
All right.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.250
Dad! Dad!

08:34.284 --> 08:36.553
Rick -- he's awake,
and he's really freaked out.

08:36.587 --> 08:40.624
Captain Weaver wants you to
meet him at the med bus.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.760
You hear me? Rick?

08:43.794 --> 08:46.464
I tried to question him.
All I get is this.

08:46.498 --> 08:47.798
He woke up
completely disoriented

08:47.833 --> 08:49.600
and panicked --
he needs rest.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.302
We don't have time
for rest.

08:51.336 --> 08:54.338
Is Ben with you?

08:54.406 --> 08:57.508
No. No, he's not.

08:57.575 --> 09:00.277
He's in danger.
We're <i>all</i> in danger.

09:00.311 --> 09:01.278
How, son?

09:01.312 --> 09:02.746
Was he with you?
Yeah.

09:02.780 --> 09:05.348
And he's hurt --
hurt real bad.

09:05.383 --> 09:07.617
- Where is he, Rick?
- I don't know, but I can find him.

09:07.651 --> 09:09.619
What do you think?
Is he well enough to move?

09:09.653 --> 09:12.622
- I suppose. But...
- H-h-hold up. Wait, wait.

09:12.656 --> 09:14.157
We do not know enough

09:14.191 --> 09:15.758
to follow this boy
wherever he says to go.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.526
He could lead us
directly into a trap.

09:17.594 --> 09:19.094
Listen,
if my son's at risk,

09:19.129 --> 09:20.629
it's a chance
I'm willing to take...

09:20.663 --> 09:22.330
Alone, if I have to.

09:28.404 --> 09:30.338
Go.
Okay.

09:30.373 --> 09:32.641
All right.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.648
Now, what exactly are we
supposed to be looking for?

09:40.683 --> 09:41.850
Don't know.

09:41.884 --> 09:44.319
Maybe that.

09:44.353 --> 09:46.621
Rick's spikes
are glowing.

09:48.191 --> 09:50.158
He's near.

09:50.193 --> 09:51.826
Ben?

09:51.861 --> 09:54.830
Yes. Ben's near,
too.

09:54.864 --> 09:57.532
What do you mean?
Ben's with somebody else?

09:57.566 --> 09:58.667
This way.

10:11.714 --> 10:14.182
Here.

10:40.342 --> 10:43.478
Ben?! It's dad!
Are you hurt?!

10:43.512 --> 10:47.616
Dad!
Just -- just go away!

10:47.650 --> 10:49.851
Ben...

10:49.886 --> 10:52.221
It's me, Rick.
I brought them here.

10:52.255 --> 10:54.223
Why would you
do that?

10:54.257 --> 10:56.492
Because he needs
their help.

10:56.526 --> 10:57.893
Otherwise he'll die

10:57.927 --> 10:59.862
and everything that
he worked for will be lost.

10:59.896 --> 11:02.464
Okay?

11:02.498 --> 11:04.299
I'm not gonna let you
hurt him.

11:04.367 --> 11:07.370
Hurt who, Ben?

11:11.244 --> 11:14.780
No! That's not possible!
No! No!

11:14.814 --> 11:16.916
Lower your weapon, Professor.
I know this Skitter!

11:16.950 --> 11:18.484
He was on the ship with me!
He tried to kill me!

11:21.855 --> 11:24.557
I saved you,
Professor.

11:24.591 --> 11:29.363
I saved you from death.
You know this to be true.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.500
We must talk.
It is urgent you understand.

11:32.534 --> 11:33.834
So put down
your weapon.

11:33.869 --> 11:36.804
Dad, if we don't help him,
he's -- he's dead.

11:36.838 --> 11:38.239
He's dead.

11:38.273 --> 11:40.574
I know
it is difficult to understand,

11:40.609 --> 11:42.309
but we are fighting
the same enemy.

11:42.344 --> 11:45.646
Anger, hate --
these I feel, too.

11:45.681 --> 11:47.982
But until we defeat
the overlords...

11:48.016 --> 11:50.517
We cannot hope to li--

11:50.552 --> 11:52.652
Stop!
Stop talking!

11:52.687 --> 11:54.787
Many lives have been sacrificed,
Tom Mason.

11:54.822 --> 11:57.523
Many more will...

11:57.558 --> 11:59.292
No.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.495
Move out of the way, son.
Dad!

12:02.529 --> 12:04.930
Dai, get Rick.
Take him out of here.

12:04.965 --> 12:06.799
It's time
to send this cockroach

12:06.833 --> 12:08.433
back to the hell
it came from.

12:08.468 --> 12:10.802
No argument here,
Captain, sir.

12:10.836 --> 12:12.437
Ple-- please!
- Wait, wait, wait! No! No!

12:12.471 --> 12:14.305
No! Wait, wait,  wait, wait!
Ho! What?!

12:17.333 --> 12:19.003
We need him --
as a prisoner.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.399
No way.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.424
The only good Skitter
is a dead Skitter.

12:24.050 --> 12:26.952
It was there
when I was interrogated.

12:26.986 --> 12:31.323
They trusted it.
It might know something.

12:31.357 --> 12:33.558
It might know
everything.

12:33.593 --> 12:35.327
I think the military
in Charleston

12:35.361 --> 12:36.729
would be interested to know
what we can get out of it.

12:36.763 --> 12:39.965
And if it <i>doesn't</i> talk?

12:39.999 --> 12:42.701
Then
it's of no use to us,

12:42.735 --> 12:46.338
we dispatch it to hell,
just the way you said.

12:49.343 --> 12:51.611
Step back.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.374
Any luck?

13:06.408 --> 13:08.843
Ah, just a couple bags
of cotton balls.

13:08.878 --> 13:11.980
Bottle of
dextro-metho-something.

13:12.014 --> 13:13.982
Should probably take that
from her before she drinks it.

13:14.016 --> 13:15.717
Ow!

13:15.751 --> 13:17.719
That's two hospitals down,
one to go.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.287
Isn't looking good.

13:25.361 --> 13:27.796
Cover, cover!
Get down!

13:27.830 --> 13:31.299
Here. Go, go, go,
go, go, go.

13:34.971 --> 13:37.140
Get down.
What?

13:37.174 --> 13:38.241
Get --

13:46.484 --> 13:49.186
Stay calm.

13:52.191 --> 13:54.159
Stay calm.

13:54.193 --> 13:57.162
I'm calm. You calm?

13:57.196 --> 13:59.031
Very calm.

13:59.065 --> 14:00.799
I've never been so calm.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.500
Yeah. Me, neither.

14:21.286 --> 14:24.288
If you ask me, we ought to throw
that shrimp on the Barbie.

14:24.322 --> 14:28.024
Ooh, maybe a little beer batter.
Yeah.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.094
Stand clear.

14:32.896 --> 14:33.997
This isn't a town-hall meeting.

14:34.031 --> 14:35.331
Back to your posts,
people.

14:35.365 --> 14:39.133
Anne, he needs your help.
Please.

14:39.167 --> 14:42.003
I don't even have enough
supplies for right now.

14:42.037 --> 14:43.538
But even if I did, why would I help it?
He's different.

14:43.572 --> 14:45.273
Why would <i>you,</i> Ben?
Please.

14:45.307 --> 14:47.375
You need to trust me. Just trust me.
I wish I could.

14:47.409 --> 14:49.477
Why won't anyone listen to me?! He's just --
Ben! Ben!

14:49.511 --> 14:50.878
Calm down.

14:50.913 --> 14:52.413
Anne, we just got to
keep it alive

14:52.481 --> 14:55.016
long enough to question it.
All right. I'll try.

14:55.050 --> 14:56.250
Lyle, Boon -- you two
keep an eye on Rick.

14:56.318 --> 14:57.819
Don't let him out
of your sight.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.354
Come find me
when the Skitter starts talking.

14:59.388 --> 15:00.488
You got it, boss.

15:00.522 --> 15:02.357
Ben,
I want to talk to you.

15:02.391 --> 15:04.993
Let's get this thing
out of here.

15:05.027 --> 15:07.395
You need to help me here,
Ben.

15:07.429 --> 15:10.264
I'm trying to explain.
By telling me

15:10.332 --> 15:12.033
some crazy story
about a Skitter rebellion?

15:12.067 --> 15:13.501
Yes! And that
he is their leader.

15:13.535 --> 15:15.536
How long have you been
in communication with him?

15:15.570 --> 15:18.139
Since Jimmy died.

15:18.173 --> 15:20.541
And your spikes? Glowing?
How long?

15:20.576 --> 15:22.076
Who told you that?
Hal told me.

15:22.111 --> 15:23.879
It doesn't matter who told me!
How long?!

15:23.913 --> 15:26.314
Around the same time.

15:26.349 --> 15:28.183
Why wouldn't
you tell <i>me?!</i>

15:28.217 --> 15:30.552
I didn't want you to see me
as the enemy.

15:30.586 --> 15:33.121
- The enemy, Ben?! Never the enemy!
- Damaged, then -- broken!

15:33.155 --> 15:35.123
I'd have been concerned, yes!
I would have tried to help you!

15:35.157 --> 15:37.024
Help me now!
How?!

15:37.059 --> 15:39.293
Just believe me!

15:43.031 --> 15:45.399
All right. Sit.

15:45.434 --> 15:49.103
A Skitter rebellion.
How is that even possible?

15:49.138 --> 15:50.872
We know they were harnessed,
too.

15:50.907 --> 15:55.277
Yes, but...some of them
have been able to

15:55.311 --> 15:57.193
resist the effects
of the harness.

15:57.194 --> 15:59.535
They've been trying to overthrow
their overlords for more than 100 years.

15:59.536 --> 16:01.238
They've been fighting,
they've been resisting,

16:01.361 --> 16:02.600
but they failed
every time.

16:02.601 --> 16:04.806
But now they think they have
a chance -- with us, together.

16:04.807 --> 16:07.157
Ben, that one tortured me --
and others. He executed them.

16:07.182 --> 16:08.334
Well, he had to do that

16:08.335 --> 16:09.869
so they wouldn't question
his loyalty!

16:09.903 --> 16:11.971
So he could get in, gain access
to their battle plans,

16:12.006 --> 16:15.441
and most importantly, so
he could find others like him.

16:15.476 --> 16:17.377
That doesn't add up.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.313
And history is full of excuses like,
"I was only following orders."

16:20.347 --> 16:22.527
And there's no excuse
for murdering innocent people.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.212
He didn't kill you.

16:28.956 --> 16:30.757
You're alive.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.892
He saved your life.

16:32.927 --> 16:34.894
Why? Why would he?

16:34.929 --> 16:38.598
Because he believes the human
race and our resistance movement

16:38.633 --> 16:40.033
is the best chance
they have,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.968
that the only way
to form an alliance

16:42.003 --> 16:44.971
is through people like me
and people like you

16:45.006 --> 16:47.974
and countless others
around the world.

16:48.009 --> 16:49.977
This is it.

16:56.051 --> 16:58.519
Ow. So damn bony.

16:59.881 --> 17:02.817
I'll bring you a pillow
next time.

17:02.851 --> 17:06.053
Ow.
Oh!

17:09.057 --> 17:12.425
You know,
my first car was a Civic.

17:12.461 --> 17:16.230
It had 212,000 miles
on it.

17:16.265 --> 17:19.050
Nobody understood
why I wanted it, but...

17:19.050 --> 17:23.421
I'd just started dating
this girl -- Rita.

17:23.455 --> 17:25.757
And there weren't
too many places we could go.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.157
So that car...

17:27.193 --> 17:30.162
Was like
your bachelor pad?

17:30.196 --> 17:33.031
You got to love tinted windows.

17:34.467 --> 17:37.302
Gave us our privacy.

17:37.336 --> 17:40.037
Ri-ta.

17:40.072 --> 17:42.840
What's wrong
with Ri-ta?

17:42.875 --> 17:45.176
It's kind of
an old-lady name.

17:45.210 --> 17:48.846
Okay, Margaret.

17:51.249 --> 17:54.952
She was no old lady,
I'll tell you that much.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.956
She was a dancer --
jazz.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.825
They would do these shows
for school.

18:01.860 --> 18:07.498
And she would wear these, like,
stretchy dance pants.

18:07.532 --> 18:09.967
A leotard?

18:10.001 --> 18:12.837
No, no. This wasn't a leotard.
This was like, some --

18:12.871 --> 18:15.940
this was like a special,
like, jazz pant.

18:15.974 --> 18:21.812
First time I saw her onstage
dancing, I was in love.

18:21.846 --> 18:24.081
Like,
love at first sight.

18:24.115 --> 18:27.217
Love at first sight
of jazz pants.

18:41.602 --> 18:44.537
Ah, I've never met anybody
that talks like you.

18:44.572 --> 18:47.040
Not even Ri-ta?

18:47.074 --> 18:49.442
There weren't a whole lot
of words between us.

18:51.111 --> 18:54.280
Or Karen?

18:56.549 --> 18:59.885
I didn't really get a chance
to find out.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.521
I-I'm sorry. 
No, no. No, no. It's okay.

19:03.555 --> 19:05.990
It's okay.

19:06.024 --> 19:08.993
I think we're okay to --
to move out now, anyway.

19:09.028 --> 19:10.028
Yeah.

19:23.675 --> 19:24.719
My problem is

19:24.720 --> 19:27.089
I don't know how to stop myself
from going too far.

19:27.123 --> 19:29.825
Like I said,
it's no big deal.

19:29.859 --> 19:32.228
It is.
I mean, it has to be.

19:32.262 --> 19:35.965
So I'm a jerk for going there,
and I'm sorry.

19:35.999 --> 19:39.635
I should have just stuck
with trashing Rita.

19:43.339 --> 19:44.740
We good?

19:44.774 --> 19:46.041
Always.

19:46.075 --> 19:47.643
All right.

19:47.677 --> 19:49.244
Guys, ever notice

19:49.279 --> 19:51.179
how you never hear
crickets at night anymore?

19:51.214 --> 19:53.881
Traffic?
Or jets in the air?

19:53.916 --> 19:56.618
Or Mr. Omanski's
TV next door,

19:56.652 --> 19:59.021
Rangers' game
blaring away.

19:59.055 --> 20:00.589
Bottom of the ninth,
bases loaded,

20:00.623 --> 20:03.725
and the sweet crack
of the bat -- crack!

20:03.759 --> 20:07.162
The crowd goes wild.

20:10.199 --> 20:14.036
Sorry. I just miss
that stuff is all.

20:14.070 --> 20:16.205
Oh. Well, maybe they
have baseball in Charleston.

20:16.239 --> 20:19.174
Yeah, maybe a TV.

20:28.384 --> 20:30.852
Can it talk?

20:30.886 --> 20:32.887
Yes, I can.

20:32.921 --> 20:35.289
We don't have time
for a lot of shenanigans.

20:35.324 --> 20:37.225
We need answers,
and we need them now.

20:37.259 --> 20:38.926
Of course,
and you will get them.

20:38.961 --> 20:42.797
But first, I wish to address
Professor Mason alone.

20:42.831 --> 20:44.232
We're not going anywhere.

20:44.266 --> 20:46.167
As you wish.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.002
It's okay, Captain.

20:52.074 --> 20:53.808
Everybody out!

20:53.842 --> 20:56.343
Let's leave them here.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.679
Come on.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.722
You have a remarkable planet,
Professor Mason.

21:08.756 --> 21:10.657
I'm not much in the mood
for platitudes.

21:10.691 --> 21:12.692
I understand.

21:12.726 --> 21:14.827
I want to know
what you know.

21:14.862 --> 21:17.897
You want to know why your son
is so important to me.

21:21.368 --> 21:22.802
Yes.

21:22.836 --> 21:24.404
Above all,
I want to know that.

21:24.438 --> 21:26.940
Yes, and I will try to answer
that to your satisfaction,

21:26.974 --> 21:29.209
but there's just so much
to tell you

21:29.243 --> 21:31.077
and very little time
to tell it in.

21:31.112 --> 21:34.114
I've got
all the time in world.

21:34.148 --> 21:35.915
I'm afraid not.

21:35.950 --> 21:38.952
As we speak, there's a death
squad on its way to kill me...

21:38.986 --> 21:41.388
and everyone
in this camp.

22:07.447 --> 22:11.284
Oh.
Clean sheets.

22:11.318 --> 22:12.985
I haven't seen that
in a while.

22:13.053 --> 22:15.121
All right. We got bandages,
antiseptic, aspirin.

22:15.155 --> 22:17.156
That's enough stuff to load up
the med bus for a while.

22:17.191 --> 22:19.325
Hey, hey.
Pharmacy.

22:28.002 --> 22:29.969
Nice!

22:30.004 --> 22:31.271
Yee-haw!

22:31.305 --> 22:33.306
Shh!
Y-you got to do that?

22:33.341 --> 22:35.942
Just expressing
some positivity, jefe.

22:35.976 --> 22:37.477
Nice.

22:37.511 --> 22:40.813
All right.
Well, let's grab what we need.

22:40.847 --> 22:42.745
We'll catch a couple hours
of sleep on those beds

22:42.770 --> 22:44.116
you were talking about.

22:44.117 --> 22:45.817
You guys earned it.
We'll head back to camp tonight.

22:45.851 --> 22:48.286
I'm gonna go
let Maggie know.

22:49.889 --> 22:51.856
You okay?

22:51.891 --> 22:53.224
Mm-hmm.

22:53.259 --> 22:55.127
Tector and Craze
are packing up some stuff,

22:55.161 --> 22:56.428
and they're gonna bed down
for a while.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.064
There's real beds in there,
clean sheets.

22:59.099 --> 23:00.332
Why don't you
come inside?

23:00.367 --> 23:02.201
Nah.

23:02.236 --> 23:04.304
Not in a hospital.

23:04.338 --> 23:07.207
Because of the cancer?

23:21.957 --> 23:25.192
You know, you never did tell me
what kind of cancer you had.

23:25.227 --> 23:26.460
No, I did.

23:26.495 --> 23:28.930
You said you had
the "bad kind."

23:28.964 --> 23:32.800
Like there's a <i>good</i> kind
of cancer.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.902
Brain tumors.

23:37.172 --> 23:38.539
More than one?

23:38.573 --> 23:41.242
Yeah. They operated on me
three times.

23:41.276 --> 23:46.346
I have actual holes
in my skull. Here.

23:48.583 --> 23:51.152
You feel
that soft spot?

23:51.186 --> 23:52.253
Uh-huh.

23:56.958 --> 23:59.026
Doesn't freak you out?

23:59.060 --> 24:00.394
No.

24:00.428 --> 24:04.298
When I went in
for the third operation,

24:04.332 --> 24:07.033
I remember thinking,
"if I don't come out of this,

24:07.068 --> 24:11.137
if I just die on the table --
I'd be okay with that."

24:11.172 --> 24:14.540
Wow.

24:14.575 --> 24:16.576
It was that bad?

24:16.610 --> 24:21.314
It's like you're out...
out of life.

24:21.348 --> 24:24.317
You're at your last
little drop.

24:24.351 --> 24:29.522
So, if it just drips away --
wasn't much left, anyway.

24:33.161 --> 24:35.161
I'm glad you got it back.

24:35.196 --> 24:38.432
I didn't get it back...

24:38.466 --> 24:40.434
not all of it.

25:04.093 --> 25:07.563
Maggie...

25:07.597 --> 25:10.299
Don't.

25:10.334 --> 25:13.303
Just don't say
anything.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.471
Forget it.

25:22.346 --> 25:26.048
There's nothing you've said
to me so far that's convinced me

25:26.082 --> 25:28.016
that any of your claims
are real.

25:28.084 --> 25:31.319
20 of my fallen comrades
in this morning's battle

25:31.353 --> 25:32.987
wasn't good enough
for you?

25:33.022 --> 25:35.190
I don't pretend to know
what this morning was about.

25:35.224 --> 25:36.458
I don't
really give a damn.

25:36.492 --> 25:40.061
But a revolution?
A resistance movement?

25:40.096 --> 25:43.932
I don't buy that.
Doesn't make any sense to me.

25:43.966 --> 25:45.200
So, how can I
convince you?

25:45.235 --> 25:46.502
You can
give me a reason!

25:46.536 --> 25:48.638
A credible one!
I owe you that at least.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.107
Strange as it may seem to you,

25:51.141 --> 25:53.376
my planet
was much like yours once.

25:53.410 --> 25:56.379
We lived in relative peace
and tranquility.

25:56.414 --> 25:58.147
Go on.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.350
Then they came and laid waste
to everything we hold dear.

26:00.384 --> 26:05.288
We were pressed into slavery,
made to do their bidding.

26:05.323 --> 26:07.691
The Khelmoch was infused
on our spines as children --

26:07.726 --> 26:09.626
the same way they had us
do to yours.

26:09.661 --> 26:13.230
You talking about the harnesses?
Yes.

26:13.264 --> 26:16.100
We tried to fight back,
but they were too powerful.

26:16.134 --> 26:18.202
And --
and then we came here.

26:18.236 --> 26:22.240
And we saw you,
how your species fights.

26:22.274 --> 26:24.642
Even after
you were almost wiped out,

26:24.676 --> 26:26.377
you refused
to capitulate.

26:26.411 --> 26:28.646
Don't you see,
Professor?

26:28.680 --> 26:32.149
Together, we could do what
neither of us could do alone --

26:32.184 --> 26:34.218
overthrow
our oppressors.

26:37.490 --> 26:40.058
It's an interesting story.

26:40.093 --> 26:42.328
I can see
why my son likes it.

26:42.362 --> 26:46.066
He always went in
for fairy tales.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.668
But the problem is
I've watched your kind.

26:48.703 --> 26:52.406
I've seen how easy it is
for you to destroy,

26:52.440 --> 26:54.541
to rip a person
to pieces.

26:54.575 --> 26:57.678
When you kill,
there is no regret.

26:57.712 --> 26:59.246
There's no remorse.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.550
I have much regret
and only remorse, Professor.

27:03.584 --> 27:06.419
So you cannot begin
to understand

27:06.454 --> 27:09.756
the depths
of my sorrow.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.358
The evidence speaks
to the contrary.

27:11.392 --> 27:14.494
Perhaps, but the point
of the matter being

27:14.528 --> 27:17.097
your weapons are substandard
and you do not understand

27:17.132 --> 27:19.166
their strategies
nor their tactics.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.135
So you can join us
and survive

27:22.203 --> 27:26.373
or fight alone
and die.

27:32.847 --> 27:36.250
Man, I forgot
what a bed feels like.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.689
Very bouncy.

27:39.757 --> 27:42.092
Hey, Maggie.
What?

27:42.126 --> 27:43.960
I just wanted to say --
Look.

27:44.028 --> 27:45.362
Just --
Look.

27:45.396 --> 27:47.797
What's important
is I know you got my back,

27:47.865 --> 27:49.933
and you know
I got yours.

27:49.967 --> 27:52.702
We're partners. All right?
That's what partners do.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.371
We watch out for each other,
but that's it.

27:54.405 --> 27:56.706
There's nothing else
here.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.941
I want there to be.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.376
Yeah, well,
we all want a lot of things.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.244
But this? No.

28:01.279 --> 28:05.481
There can't be.
So, just stop. Now.

28:26.838 --> 28:29.406
Almost home, people.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.154
- What is that?
- It's as I feared.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.756
The death squad
got onto my trail.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.791
They will kill us all.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.172
Anybody see where that came from?!
Hell no!

29:03.809 --> 29:05.309
Where's Maggie?!

29:05.343 --> 29:09.046
Go!
Get the hell out of here!

29:09.114 --> 29:10.515
Cover me!

29:10.549 --> 29:12.950
Why?!
We got nothing to shoot at!

29:15.053 --> 29:17.054
No!

29:20.359 --> 29:22.060
What are you doing?!
Get out of here!

29:22.094 --> 29:24.862
I can't! I got to haul
your lazy butt back to camp!

29:26.432 --> 29:27.799
Come on!

29:27.833 --> 29:29.902
Idiot!

29:31.972 --> 29:35.842
Hold on!

29:40.247 --> 29:41.514
Get away from it, Tom.

29:41.549 --> 29:44.384
The bastard has led them
directly to us.

29:44.418 --> 29:46.819
No. No.
That's not it.

29:46.854 --> 29:48.354
- Wait.
- Lyle, Dai --

29:48.389 --> 29:50.557
get those kids
away from the cage.

29:50.591 --> 29:52.092
Dan, there's something
you need to hear.

29:52.126 --> 29:54.294
You stand down, Tom.
This isn't the way.

29:54.329 --> 29:57.498
I'm giving you an order.
No.

29:58.867 --> 30:00.867
You stand down --

30:00.902 --> 30:03.436
now, damn it!
Aah!

30:04.471 --> 30:06.172
No, no, no, no!
No!

30:06.206 --> 30:07.340
Don't shoot!

30:10.444 --> 30:11.411
Rick!

30:14.882 --> 30:17.150
Rick.

30:20.021 --> 30:22.223
All right.

30:24.359 --> 30:27.228
I got you.
There.

30:30.199 --> 30:32.567
Is she gonna be all right?
We don't know yet.

30:34.103 --> 30:35.937
We've got to move!

30:37.440 --> 30:39.274
Can you find me
a driver?

30:39.309 --> 30:41.543
Hal!
Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I got it.

30:41.577 --> 30:44.312
You got her?
Yeah, we got her.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.613
Slow and steady, Hal!

30:45.648 --> 30:47.582
All right.
All right. Slow and steady.

30:53.588 --> 30:55.288
Slow and steady.

30:59.193 --> 31:01.160
Ben...

31:01.195 --> 31:03.162
Ben, it's okay.

31:03.196 --> 31:07.166
Killing this one person
doesn't matter.

31:07.201 --> 31:09.435
We'll win it.
I know it.

31:09.470 --> 31:13.440
Just...
talk to your father.

31:13.474 --> 31:18.044
You have a father,
Ben...

31:19.479 --> 31:21.313
Ben...

31:21.348 --> 31:22.982
make him believe.

31:25.619 --> 31:27.586
Make --
make them believe.

31:27.621 --> 31:31.057
You can do it.
You could do it.

31:41.302 --> 31:43.336
Ben...

31:45.373 --> 31:48.108
He needs my help.

31:48.142 --> 31:51.311
He needs my help.
Ben.

31:51.345 --> 31:52.946
He needs me.
Ben.

31:52.980 --> 31:56.082
He needs me! He needs me! Needs me!
We need you.

31:56.117 --> 31:59.352
We need you.
We need you.

31:59.387 --> 32:03.357
I need you.
It's okay.

32:03.391 --> 32:06.093
It's okay.

32:06.127 --> 32:08.095
It's okay.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.074
It doesn't look like there
are any bullet fragments, Hal.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.076
It missed her lung.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.612
Dr. Glass
thinks she'll be fine.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.414
I'll give you guys
a little time.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.520
Why'd you come back
for me?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.122
"Why?"

32:38.156 --> 32:39.824
What kind of a question
is that?

32:39.858 --> 32:42.727
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.662
And you would have died
out there.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.531
There's people
who depend on you, Hal.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.266
There's people
who need you.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.067
Same with you.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.637
No.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.542
<i>I</i> need you, okay?

32:57.576 --> 33:01.279
I need you.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.149
You said it yourself.
We got each other's backs.

33:05.183 --> 33:09.254
We look out for each other.
We take care of each other.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.358
And if anything ever happened
to you, Maggie, I --

33:13.392 --> 33:14.659
Hey.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.263
What is this?

33:24.270 --> 33:26.671
It's just that, uh...

33:28.407 --> 33:33.778
...I know you're gonna say this
is crazy and stupid,

33:33.813 --> 33:37.849
but when I saw you laying there
on the ground...

33:37.884 --> 33:42.120
I...

33:42.155 --> 33:43.689
Hey.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.824
What?

33:47.560 --> 33:51.529
Nothing.

33:51.564 --> 33:52.831
I'll just...

33:55.802 --> 33:57.536
What?

33:57.571 --> 34:00.472
Can you do me a favor?

34:00.507 --> 34:02.474
Anything.

34:04.778 --> 34:07.146
Sit down.

34:07.180 --> 34:08.681
Okay.

34:08.716 --> 34:12.717
And can you just stay here
till I fall asleep?

34:12.752 --> 34:14.853
I can do that.

34:44.217 --> 34:46.583
This is the third time you've stuck
me with a needle, Doctor.

34:46.619 --> 34:47.918
What the hell
is this one for?

34:47.953 --> 34:51.355
To help you sleep.
You mean like a sedative?

34:53.224 --> 34:54.592
You tricked me.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.893
Oops.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.933
Good to finally have
the proper tools and medicines.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.601
Back in the day,
the surgeon

35:03.636 --> 35:06.237
would have just cut your leg off
and hoped for the best.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.940
Well, I guess I should be
thankful for small miracles.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.343
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

35:12.378 --> 35:13.444
I did, Tom.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.613
Doc, could you give us
a moment?

35:15.647 --> 35:17.314
All right.
Not too long, Captain.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.949
I need you off that leg
and resting.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.985
You have my word.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.788
There's no roundabout way
to say it, Tom.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.225
I'm pissed as hell at you.
Understandable.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.626
Forget the danger
that your actions put us in.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.362
You disobeyed
a direct order.

35:31.396 --> 35:32.630
I know.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.399
And for that,
I'm sorry.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.472
Your apology is accepted,

35:41.507 --> 35:46.611
but --
and this is big --

35:46.646 --> 35:48.480
I'm worried about Ben.

35:48.514 --> 35:51.644
I have been
ever since Jimmy's death.

35:51.669 --> 35:52.704
Me too.

35:52.707 --> 35:55.977
I'm not talking about worried
about his well-being.

35:55.989 --> 35:59.691
I'm concerned about the risk
he poses to the 2nd Mass.

36:06.766 --> 36:08.767
No. You're right.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.041
I've been concerned
about that, too.

36:17.075 --> 36:21.479
He's my son, Dan.
I don't know what to do.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.949
I understand.
I do.

36:24.983 --> 36:28.285
The point is...

36:28.320 --> 36:32.055
hard choices have to be made
sometimes.

36:32.090 --> 36:35.325
I agree.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.561
And when the time comes,

36:38.596 --> 36:41.465
how will you be
with the hard choice?

36:50.608 --> 36:52.842
I don't know.

36:55.346 --> 36:58.648
I honestly don't know.

36:58.683 --> 37:01.918
Fair enough.

37:01.952 --> 37:04.754
But I'd just as soon
not have to make it for you.

37:06.357 --> 37:09.359
Understood?
Understood.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.863
Fine.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.400
I got to lie down now.
Doctor's orders.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.672
Yes, sir.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.641
Tom...

37:24.676 --> 37:27.044
when Porter first put us
together,

37:27.078 --> 37:28.779
I didn't like you
very much.

37:31.683 --> 37:35.385
Really?
Couldn't tell.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.986
Well,
I don't mind telling you

37:37.021 --> 37:39.022
that the feeling
was more than mutual.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.358
I can be a stubborn
son of a bitch sometimes.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.760
Sometimes?

37:44.795 --> 37:48.364
I didn't ever see
how some Professor

37:48.398 --> 37:50.032
gonna be any use
in battle.

37:51.734 --> 37:54.703
But...

37:54.738 --> 37:57.005
Tom...

37:59.709 --> 38:03.545
...I've come
to respect you...

38:03.580 --> 38:06.849
to...

38:09.419 --> 38:12.822
I feel the same way,
Dan.

38:39.118 --> 38:41.653
- Is he out?
- Completely.

38:41.688 --> 38:44.690
Probably more sleep than
that man has had in four months.

38:44.724 --> 38:46.826
I have three new antibiotics
to try on his infection.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.962
I'll have a better feel
for it tomorrow.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.963
We're lucky
we found this place.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.432
Got another two weeks
of rough road

38:52.466 --> 38:53.833
before we get
to Charleston.

38:53.867 --> 38:56.970
This will give us all
a chance to recharge.

38:57.004 --> 39:00.006
Amen to that.
How's Ben?

39:02.776 --> 39:05.512
He's, you know --
he's...Typical teenager --

39:05.546 --> 39:07.447
he's having trouble
relating to his father,

39:07.482 --> 39:09.850
and he wants to
change the world.

39:09.884 --> 39:11.952
You may not be
that far off.

39:11.986 --> 39:15.489
No matter what else is going on,
he is a teenager.

39:17.025 --> 39:19.460
He's just
so damn sure of himself.

39:20.796 --> 39:23.531
It's like he knows
exactly what he's doing.

39:23.565 --> 39:25.533
He's more sure of himself
than I am.

39:25.567 --> 39:28.136
Just be there with him.
You'll be fine.

39:28.170 --> 39:32.473
Ah, I suppose so.
I hope so.

39:32.508 --> 39:35.510
That's all we have
for now.

39:39.548 --> 39:42.917
Looks like Jamil got the hospital's
emergency generator going.

39:42.951 --> 39:46.187
Now if we can just get him
to work on running water.

39:46.221 --> 39:48.189
Oh, we got to have something
to look forward to

39:48.224 --> 39:50.191
in Charleston.
I suppose.

39:50.226 --> 39:52.527
Still...

39:52.561 --> 39:55.196
Oh, there's a lot of rooms
around this place.

39:55.231 --> 39:56.798
You notice that?

39:56.832 --> 39:59.801
It was the first thing
I noticed.

39:59.835 --> 40:02.804
Really?

40:02.839 --> 40:04.706
Really?

40:41.680 --> 40:45.183
Not afraid of heights
anymore?

40:45.217 --> 40:47.185
No.

40:47.219 --> 40:50.656
Don't feel scared
of anything anymore.

40:50.690 --> 40:53.659
That's impossible.

40:53.693 --> 40:55.927
Why?

40:55.962 --> 40:57.796
Just because.

40:59.199 --> 41:01.200
That's not
much of an answer.

41:02.269 --> 41:04.270
No.

41:05.939 --> 41:09.075
You're right.
It's not. It's not.

41:12.913 --> 41:16.883
Matt, if I, uh...
If I told you something,

41:16.917 --> 41:19.185
you think
you could keep it a secret?

41:19.219 --> 41:21.220
I think so, yeah.

41:22.889 --> 41:25.124
I, uh...

41:25.158 --> 41:29.028
