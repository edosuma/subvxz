41:41.416 --> 41:42.792
OH.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.378
WE PRACTICALLY HAD TO BEG HIM

41:42.834 --> 41:45.378
TO COME BACK, ALL RIGHT?

41:45.420 --> 41:47.130
HE'S NOT DRINKING.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.130
HE'S AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.381
I GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.799
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE

41:48.423 --> 41:49.799
WE PULLED THIS ONE OFF.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.718
WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.718
HE KEEPS WINNING.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.554
AND EVERY TIME HE WINS,

41:52.760 --> 41:55.554
HE BELIEVES A LITTLE BIT MORE

41:55.596 --> 41:56.889
THAT HE CAN CONTROL...

41:56.931 --> 41:59.600
LIFE.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.353
IT'S WHAT GETS HIM

41:59.642 --> 42:01.353
THROUGH THE DAY.

42:01.394 --> 42:04.314
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE LOSES?

42:04.356 --> 42:07.359
LAST TIME HE LOST, IT BROKE HIM.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.776
HE BREAKS AGAIN,

42:08.818 --> 42:12.530
I DON'T THINK EVEN WE

42:08.818 --> 42:12.530
COULD PICK UP THE PIECES.
