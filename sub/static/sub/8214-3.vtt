00:02.400 --> 00:05.995
*

00:30.830 --> 00:31.649
Mr. Dirkson,

00:31.690 --> 00:34.591
I believe congratulations
are in order.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.791
Yeah, we closed this afternoon.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.718
Your friends at Lambrex
had me send

00:38.770 --> 00:40.397
a little something
up to your room.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.429
Oh, nice.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.506
Anything else I can help you
with this evening?

00:43.540 --> 00:45.098
I'm all set,
but thank you, Robert.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.176
Okay.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.523
You're back early.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.762
Who are you?

01:16.840 --> 01:18.728
I'm Jackie.

01:18.770 --> 01:21.375
Well, Jackie,
it's nice to meet you,

01:21.410 --> 01:22.843
but I think you're
in the wrong room.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.475
I'm in the right room...
trust me.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.448
Quite a "little something."

01:32.490 --> 01:36.426
Why don't you give me a hand
with the zipper.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.862
(music playing on radio,
children laughing)

01:46.900 --> 01:49.539
* I want you close, I want you

01:49.570 --> 01:52.869
* I won't treat you
like you're typical... *

01:52.910 --> 01:54.400
Hello.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.668
Hi, Carrie. The usual?
Yes.

01:55.710 --> 01:56.642
Diesel fuel,

01:56.680 --> 01:58.204
four shots,
five sugars.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.377
Very nice. You remembered.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.388
Yeah, thanks to you
and my new little system,

02:02.420 --> 02:03.887
I never forget an order anymore.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.285
Oh, really

02:05.320 --> 02:06.787
Oh, wow. Wow!

02:06.820 --> 02:08.913
See? That's you.
Ah... nice.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.848
DEEJAY:
That one's sure
to pick you up on a Monday,

02:10.890 --> 02:12.699
and I bet this might, too.
Gentlemen, start
your engines.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.493
How about the first caller...
Oh. Here, keep the...

02:14.530 --> 02:15.224
to name Billboard's
number one song...

02:15.260 --> 02:16.625
Wait a second.
Walt, waIt, wait.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.399
...from January 17, 1998
will win

02:18.430 --> 02:21.160
a free slqdiving lesson for two.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.532
Oh, we already got someone.
Hello, caller.

02:23.570 --> 02:25.561
Yes! "Truly Madly Deeply,"
Savage Garden.

02:25.610 --> 02:28.408
I hope you're ready to jump out
of a perfectly good airplane,

02:28.440 --> 02:29.748
because that's right!
Oh!

02:29.780 --> 02:31.475
Slqdiving

02:31.510 --> 02:32.272
Yeah. Come on.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.515
You are the one
who said you wanted

02:34.550 --> 02:36.484
to face your fears.
I never said that.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.283
Yes, you did.
November 7, 2012.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.548
It was a Wednesday.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.854
We were having lunch
at Misai Sake House
on Northern Boulevard.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.482
Okay, I said it,
but I was referring

02:43.530 --> 02:44.622
to eating
raw sea urchin,

02:44.660 --> 02:45.854
not jumping out
of an airplane.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.597
Al, you need
to face your fears.

02:48.630 --> 02:49.619
Just jump.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.365
Morning, guys.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.492
Hey, Jay.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.632
Victim's name is
Paul Dirkson.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.468
Maid found him dead in his room
this morning, strangled.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.501
Webster's already
upstairs.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.078
No sign of forced entry.

03:05.110 --> 03:08.546
Figure either Dirkson let his
killer in or someone had a key.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.581
Any witnesses?

03:09.620 --> 03:11.781
Nah. Nothing so far.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.583
Hey, Jo.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.953
Hi. Waste of a perfectly good
silk tie if you ask me.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.719
You got a time of death
for us, Jo?

03:18.760 --> 03:19.795
Uh, yeah, according to rigor,

03:19.830 --> 03:21.525
between 8:00 and 10:00
last night.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.492
He missing any valuables?

03:22.530 --> 03:26.739
Mm-hmm. His watch is gone,
his wallet is gone.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.328
His cell phone's
over on the table.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.361
Sounds like a robbery
gone wrong.

03:31.770 --> 03:34.671
Jay, you got a glove?

03:34.710 --> 03:37.270
Put a fraud alert out
on his credit cards.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.395
Hey, Carrie, we got
the hotel manager.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.260
Thanks.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.966
Mr. Dirkson checked in
three days ago.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.807
He was from Philadelphia.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.638
Ran a Fortune 500
hedge fund.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.477
He was in _town
overseeing

04:12.520 --> 04:13.839
a considerable
telecommunications merger.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.542
Anything unusual come up
during his stay?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.319
He and his colleagues were out
most of the time.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.750
Someone accessed this room,
so we'll have to take a look

04:20.790 --> 04:22.052
at hotel security tapes.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.455
I'm sorry.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.650
There are none.

04:24.690 --> 04:25.782
We have cameras
in the lobby

04:25.830 --> 04:27.627
and key card readers
on every door,

04:27.660 --> 04:30.561
but, uh, no surveillance
up in The Towers.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.362
The Towers?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.732
Our premium floors.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.988
The St. Laurent caters
to an elite clientele...

04:36.040 --> 04:37.166
Oh.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.804
...some of whom wish to
remain out of the public eye.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.001
Their privacy is sacred to us.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.348
Of course.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.802
Could you get me a list

04:44.850 --> 04:46.875
of the St. Laurent's employees?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.547
Not a problem.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.459
Detectives, how long do you
expect to tie up the suite?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.481
As long as it takes.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.751
It's just that, uh...
let me be blunt.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.350
There are seven conventions
In the crty right now.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.824
That suite goes
for $5,200 a night.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.861
Oh.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.906
One of his guests is found
murdered in a hotel suite,

05:10.940 --> 05:13.101
and all he cares about
is flipping the room.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.438
Guess Paul Dirkson
should've stayed

05:15.480 --> 05:17.004
in The City of Brotherly Love.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.769
AL: All right, I got a timeline
for our victim Dirkson.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.619
Housekeeping delivered

05:38.670 --> 05:41.093
strawberries and
champagne at 8:30 pm.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.563
According to his pals,
Dirkson isn't feeling well,

05:43.610 --> 05:44.736
he leaves dinner early,

05:44.770 --> 05:46.931
gets back to the hotel at 9:35.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.006
In between, at 9:06,
someone swipes his key card.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.005
Well, then that's our guy.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.712
Problem is, we looked at
lobby security footage

05:53.750 --> 05:54.774
from that evening,
everyone's accounted for.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.879
That's because he didn't come
through the lobby.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.787
I ran background checks
on all the hotel employees.

05:59.820 --> 06:03.119
Turns out the concierge got
fired from his last job in LA.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.685
for tipping off the paparazzi to
when celebrities were arriving.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.129
And after I explained
to him accessory

06:07.160 --> 06:08.627
_ to murder's_
a lIttle more serious

06:08.660 --> 06:09.729
than pissing off Kim Kardashian,

06:09.770 --> 06:10.964
he admitted to setting up

06:11.000 --> 06:12.797
guys at the back door,

06:12.840 --> 06:16.059
which, as it turns out, is how
the beautiful people check in.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.704
You're thinking,
if a photographer

06:17.740 --> 06:19.708
was out there last night,

06:19.740 --> 06:22.038
maybe he caught our guy
coming in the back way.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.502
Someone was there.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.778
Our concierge tipped his pal

06:24.810 --> 06:26.744
that Megan Fox was arriving
yesterday evening.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.771
Guy sat out there shooting
for 4 hours.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.912
You get all the photos?

06:29.950 --> 06:31.838
No, not yet. They're actually
owned by his magazine.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.154
The editor's giving me
the runaround. But don't worry,

06:34.190 --> 06:35.680
I'll get 'em.
Well, you should

06:35.720 --> 06:37.449
loop Eliot in.
He'll know who to call.

06:37.490 --> 06:38.684
Like I said, I'll get 'em.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.634
Did you ever wonder how
a big, strapping guy like this

06:46.670 --> 06:50.561
could be strangled
without any defensive wounds?

06:50.610 --> 06:51.759
He was drugged.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.835
Mm. Drugged to death.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.472
He was poisoned.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.909
See the injection site?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.510
Strangulation was
an afterthought.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.040
The agent that they used
was Tomexide.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.844
It's a genetically engineered
pharmaceutical

07:03.890 --> 07:06.859
that hospitals use
in minute doses

07:06.890 --> 07:08.778
to induce comas
In patients.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.687
Anything above
two micrograms is fatal.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.755
This poor guy never knew
what hit him.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.449
All right,
so here's the question:

07:15.500 --> 07:17.661
why do you strangle someone
who's already dead?

07:18.800 --> 07:22.566
_ To make it look_
like a crIme of passmn.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.534
Using Tomexide is anything
but passionate.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.573
No, to take down a guy like
this, you need some expertise.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.942
Maybe a trained killer.

07:38.550 --> 07:41.189
50 bucks for two
hours, 60 for three.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.585
Flat screen,

07:42.630 --> 07:43.949
six channels of porn.

07:43.990 --> 07:46.083
Theme rooms will run you more.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.495
Whatever has the most privacy.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.622
Two nights.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.091
You got contraband in there?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.597
Uh, just a joint. For insomnia.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.904
Harley's a retired police dog.

07:57.940 --> 08:01.103
Yeah, it's, uh,
old habits die hard, huh?

08:01.140 --> 08:02.903
Oh, no!
Careful! Careful!

08:02.950 --> 08:04.247
He tried to bite off

08:04.280 --> 08:05.747
someone's finger
last month.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.946
Hey, you ain't a cop, are you?

08:12.790 --> 08:14.951
Thank you.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.953
Tina.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.021
$200.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.232
Thank you.

08:28.270 --> 08:29.601
Enjoy.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.646
Well, that was fast.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.875
The room was formally released,
what, two hours ago?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.309
Yeah, well, for
$5,200 a night,

08:42.350 --> 08:43.908
they'd better be fast.

08:43.950 --> 08:47.716
Okay, so Dirkson entered
the room at 9:30,

08:47.760 --> 08:49.216
put his phone here.

08:49.260 --> 08:53.720
He ends up dead, and the
place is turned upside down.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.897
The Tomexide would've
dropped him instantly.

08:54.930 --> 08:56.056
So there was no struggle.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.795
The mess was_all
for our benefit,

08:57.830 --> 08:59.127
to make it look like a robbery.

08:59.170 --> 09:00.899
And if we think
it's a robbery-homicide,

09:00.940 --> 09:02.532
maybe we miss the poison.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.870
Or maybe we miss something else.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.152
Last time we were alone in
a hotel room was In Syracuse.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.226
That dive motel.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.693
That's not right.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.869
Okay, maybe it wasn't
technically a dive.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.867
We did have our own bathroom.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.630
CARRIE:
No, there's something
wrong here.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.167
JAY: _
Hey, CarrIe,
got the hotel manager.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.958
These kind of hotels,

09:56.990 --> 10:00.721
they usually organize the
amenities in the exact same way,

10:00.760 --> 10:02.057
right?
You're asking me?

10:02.100 --> 10:04.989
The last time we were here,
all this was different.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.193
The dock was here, right?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.107
The headphones were here,

10:11.140 --> 10:13.005
the magazines were over here.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.405
The maid had already done
turndown service

10:14.440 --> 10:15.304
before Dirkson arrived.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.149
If these amenities had been
out of order,

10:17.180 --> 10:18.909
she would've rearranged them.
So, why would...?

10:23.990 --> 10:24.911
Al...

10:24.950 --> 10:26.759
Give you a hand?
Yep.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.721
Always a gentleman.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.051
What?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.896
Here.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.708
You got a light?

10:44.940 --> 10:47.079
Well, thank you very much.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.949
There's something wedged down
in here right by the air duct.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.015
Here.

10:53.050 --> 10:54.347
Mm.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.784
Got it.
Got it.

11:00.820 --> 11:01.912
Okay.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.759
What is...?

11:08.060 --> 11:09.960
What the...?

11:11.030 --> 11:13.999
What the hell is that?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.099
It's a mobile data
extraction device.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.199
CIA and military use
them to secretly access

11:18.240 --> 11:20.128
data from
a suspect's cell phone.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.034
Basically,
if it's on your phone,

11:22.080 --> 11:23.945
this baby can copy
and transmit it.

11:23.980 --> 11:25.379
We recovered Dirkson's phone
at the scene.

11:25.410 --> 11:26.741
If someone wanted the data,

11:26.780 --> 11:28.213
why not just take
the damn phone?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.319
Because they
weren't interested

11:29.350 --> 11:31.841
in what was
on hIs phone.

11:31.890 --> 11:34.085
Photos from inside
the ceiling vent.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.849
Note the sensor?

11:35.890 --> 11:38.450
It's aimed in_
an upward dIrectIon.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.799
In this case,
directly into the room

11:40.830 --> 11:41.922
above Dirkson's.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.726
Dirkson got back early,
surprised someone planting that.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.192
He wasn't the target;
his room was.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.935
Exactly.

11:48.970 --> 11:49.937
You said that thing
can transmit data?
Yeah.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.336
To a remote device,
most likely a computer.

11:52.370 --> 11:54.736
Any way you can track down
an IP address?

11:54.780 --> 11:57.146
Well, I could,
but I'd have to back-trace

11:57.180 --> 11:59.045
every signal that pinged
off the hotel's Wi-Fi.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.015
I mean, we're talking thousands,
tens of thousands of signals.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.883
How about you start with signals
from the last couple days?

12:07.220 --> 12:08.312
Okay.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.155
MURRAY:
So I cross-referenced the drug

12:12.190 --> 12:15.057
that killed Dirkson
with the data extraction device

12:15.100 --> 12:16.499
in the Interpol database.

12:16.530 --> 12:19.294
I found a group that used both.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.763
Alpha Five.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.767
A covert,

12:21.800 --> 12:23.939
paramilitary unit
from the former Soviet Union.

12:23.970 --> 12:24.959
After the Cold War,

12:25.010 --> 12:26.363
these guys
went private,

12:26.410 --> 12:27.900
working out of
Romania mostly.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.532
Strictly mercenary.

12:29.580 --> 12:30.899
When was their last operation?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.168
Um, January 2013.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.869
An al-Qaeda
middleman

12:34.920 --> 12:35.909
in Vienna made the mistake

12:35.950 --> 12:38.111
of stopping at a pastry shop
for some marzipan.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.550
This is all
that's left of him.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.353
Carrie...

12:42.390 --> 12:45.052
Dirkson was just
collateral damage.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.955
Alpha Five takes down
bigger prey.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.854
Yeah.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.219
Question is:
who are they really hunting?

13:01.610 --> 13:02.304
This is about the man
who was killed

13:02.340 --> 13:03.477
in the room below me,
isn't it?

13:03.510 --> 13:04.477
That's right.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.046
Just tying up some loose ends.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.843
Ms. Hall, we understand
you've been staying

13:07.880 --> 13:09.177
at the St. Laurent all week?

13:09.220 --> 13:10.517
I'm a buyer for Neiman Marcus.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.950
We have meetings in New York
several times a year.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.982
I'll get it.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.586
Has anyone else been
staying here with you?

13:19.630 --> 13:21.120
Any friends or family?
No. Just me.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.299
My husband stayed
back in Chicago with the kids.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.127
MURRAY:
Mm.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.592
We believe someone tried
to hack Into your cell phone.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.495
My cell phone?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.906
Why would anyone
be interested in my phone?

13:30.940 --> 13:33.374
Your room service receipts
for the past week.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.378
What the hell are you doing?

13:35.410 --> 13:36.377
That's private.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.844
Dinner for two, champagne...

13:38.880 --> 13:40.472
double Swedish massage,

13:40.520 --> 13:41.771
adult movies.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.539
Maybe it wasn't your phone
they were after.
Okay.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.114
What gives you the right...
We are not

13:46.150 --> 13:47.481
the morality police, Ms. Hall.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.818
We're simply trying
to solve a murder.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.596
His name's Kevin Purcell.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.463
We met three years ago
in Chicago.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.592
He's been here with me.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.335
Was he here last night?

14:04.910 --> 14:06.161
Look, we're both married.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.177
And Kevin is

14:07.210 --> 14:08.472
a press attach
with the UN.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.602
He could get fired for this.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.176
Press attach?

14:11.210 --> 14:12.643
Who is he
assigned to?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.171
Right now he's with a political
activist from West Africa.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.188
I'm sorry,
I forget his name.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.517
Uh, Kevin said he's up
for a Nobel Peace Prize.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.256
Dr. Okoro Dimka.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.052
Yes.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.159
That's him.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.358
Dimka is a real hero
in West Africa.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.221
He's the first person to take on
the diamond monopolies.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.158
Wanted to spread the wealth,
and the profits.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.667
I'm guessing there
were enough of those

14:33.700 --> 14:35.565
to hire the services
of Alpha Five.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.204
Mm-hmm. He's been
a target before.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.333
His house was
bombed last winter.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.473
Two of his guards
were killed.

14:40.510 --> 14:44.048
Looks like his trouble has
followed him to Manhattan.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.427
Can I help you?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.620
Hey, I just
thought maybe, uh...

15:05.670 --> 15:08.594
I could help you
with the joint you mentioned.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.470
Whoa, what's...
what's all that?

15:13.510 --> 15:14.431
Oh, nothing.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.471
Just assembling
a long-range sniper rifle.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.148
You're what?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.147
Chill out.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.716
It's a toy
for my nephew.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.115
See?

15:22.150 --> 15:23.139
Plastic.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.544
Cool.

15:32.190 --> 15:35.921
Hey, you know,
maybe I could use the company.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.702
I'll get a lighter.

15:44.740 --> 15:45.934
All right.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.483
DIMKA:
I've been shot at,

16:02.520 --> 16:05.648
I've been imprisoned
and tortured.

16:05.690 --> 16:06.657
And yet I'm still here.

16:06.690 --> 16:07.691
ELIOT:
We understand that,

16:07.730 --> 16:09.994
but now you're a
guest in our city,

16:10.030 --> 16:12.260
and your safety
is in our hands.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.439
Sir, whoever's
behind this already knows

16:14.470 --> 16:15.732
your entire schedule
for the week.

16:15.770 --> 16:16.998
DIMKA:
How is this possible?

16:17.040 --> 16:19.008
AL:
Your press attach.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.302
Someone hacked his BlackBerry

16:20.340 --> 16:21.432
while he was staying
at a hotel.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.277
I see.

16:23.310 --> 16:26.177
Well... what do you propose?

16:26.210 --> 16:30.112
We would like you to cancel
your public appearances.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.617
That will not be possible.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.789
True reform cannot occur

16:37.660 --> 16:40.629
ELIOT:
With all due
respect, Doctor,

16:40.660 --> 16:41.797
nobody's gonna
hear your message

16:41.830 --> 16:43.422
if you're not around
to deliver it.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.119
We can move everything
on your itinerary

16:45.170 --> 16:47.263
to a secure, private location.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.767
I'm sorry.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.109
These people want me
to live in fear.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.607
I will not.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.279
Dr. Dimka, the work you've
done to unite the people

16:55.310 --> 16:57.369
_ of West Africa
Is extraordInary.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.775
You've had a huge impact.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.209
You've changed lives.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.717
So you're familiar with my work?

17:01.750 --> 17:02.774
Yes.

17:02.820 --> 17:03.514
Yes, of course.

17:03.550 --> 17:06.189
Then you are aware
that my speech

17:06.220 --> 17:07.710
at Hudson University

17:07.760 --> 17:09.216
will be seen
around the world.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.227
Mm-hmm.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.728
I'll not cancel the event.

17:17.630 --> 17:20.690
agree to move
everything else.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.629
Not because I'm afraid,
but because

17:23.670 --> 17:26.798
I want to see
my grandchildren grow up

17:26.840 --> 17:28.705
in a new Africa.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.338
Told you I'd get 'em.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.712
Paparazzi photos
from the hotel

17:34.750 --> 17:35.512
the night Dirkson
was killed.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.586
Got to love those
old school ties.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.780
Thought that magazine editor
wasn't budging.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.151
Well, he wasn't,

17:40.190 --> 17:41.509
but it just so happens
me and his kid

17:41.560 --> 17:43.084
went to prep school
together.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.859
And we were both on
the tennis team, so...
Hold on.

17:44.890 --> 17:45.788
You went to prep school?

17:45.830 --> 17:47.127
As a matter
of fact, yeah.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.627
Where I also
had the chance

17:48.660 --> 17:49.752
to help a
classmate of mine

17:49.800 --> 17:52.564
pass his Philosophy of Art
final in our junior year.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.488
Though I'd rather
not say how.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.768
Hold on.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.506
You were on the tennis team?

17:57.540 --> 17:59.201
Right.
So, all we got to do

17:59.240 --> 18:00.798
is run 'em up against
the Alpha Five photos,

18:00.840 --> 18:01.807
maybe we have a match.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.807
Yeah. Impressive.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.068
Thanks.

18:04.110 --> 18:06.806
So aren't you gonna say, "Hold
on, Philosophy of Art final?"

18:06.850 --> 18:09.819
As a matter of fact,
I wasn't.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.841
But now that you mention it...

18:11.890 --> 18:13.084
Oh...

18:15.360 --> 18:16.657
MURRAY:
Those are the latest

18:16.690 --> 18:17.657
from Russian
state securIty.

18:17.690 --> 18:18.827
JAY:
Excuse me, ladies.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.259
Hi.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.824
Okay, here we go.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.498
With a little bit of luck
and some commonaIIty

18:23.530 --> 18:25.862
of facial features,
we should nail this guy.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.436
We're scanning everyone

18:31.470 --> 18:32.607
who came in the back way.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.906
Come on,
come on, come on.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.204
Got him.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.547
Got her.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.138
Wow, it's a woman.

18:42.180 --> 18:43.784
What? No, not that
a woman can't...

18:43.820 --> 18:46.709
you know...
Right

18:46.750 --> 18:47.819
Former Lieutenant
Jacqueline Mikhailova.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.249
Goes by Jackie M.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.155
I didn't mean that women
can't be assassins, I...

18:52.190 --> 18:53.623
CARRIE:
Apparently, this one
can be anything she wants.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.924
Silent combat techniques,
kidnapping,

18:55.960 --> 18:59.293
assassinations,
biochemical toxicology.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.161
All that,
and she still has time

19:01.200 --> 19:03.361
to help the kids
with the homework.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.162
MURRAY:
Interpol considers her
a person of interest

19:05.210 --> 19:07.599
in eight assassinations in
the last two years alone.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.302
Let's not make it nine.

19:12.850 --> 19:15.148
*

19:55.890 --> 19:57.016
CARRIE:
When she was 14,

19:57.060 --> 20:00.359
her entire family was murdered
by Chechen separatists.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.856
Six months later,
she joined Alpha Five.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.290
Looks like she made her
first kill when she was 17.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.422
Just a kid.

20:06.470 --> 20:07.539
AL: _
InterestIng.

20:07.570 --> 20:08.992
She's got an actual M.O.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.237
The vast majority
of her victims

20:12.270 --> 20:14.329
were killed in small,
everyday locations.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.439
Laundromats,
restaurants...

20:16.480 --> 20:18.948
Easier to control
the enVIronment.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.848
I don't think she's gonna risk
the awards ceremony.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.017
Too many variables.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.984
Well, we've moved
everything else

20:26.020 --> 20:28.784
to Gracie Mansion, so...

20:30.390 --> 20:32.950
Except Jackie doesn't know that.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.790
Mm-hmm.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.889
Absolutely not. No.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.431
Eliot, when we signed on here,

20:40.470 --> 20:41.869
you pretty much gave us
carte blanche

20:41.900 --> 20:43.037
to run our own operation.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.139
You said, "I'll always
have your backs.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.400
You're empowered to get
results, whatever it takes."

20:46.440 --> 20:49.000
Well, it's funny,
I don't recall saying that.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.440
It was July 22.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.619
Raining out...
Yeah. Right.

20:53.650 --> 20:54.947
Okay.

20:54.980 --> 20:57.289
Do you ever...
you know...

20:57.320 --> 20:58.878
get tired of it?
AL:
Yeah.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.818
Once I did.

20:59.850 --> 21:00.987
October 10, 2012.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.317
We were at dinner.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.725
It was a Thursday,
if I'm not mistaken.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.489
You two should go on Letterman.
Listen.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.998
Jackie thinks Dimka is having
lunch with his biographer

21:08.030 --> 21:10.021
at the Third Street Caf
tomorrow in the Village.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.960
_ All we have to do
Is plant some undercovers

21:12.000 --> 21:13.888
and she shows up.
ELIOT: Yes,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.396
but in order
for that plan to work,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.067
the restaurant has to be
open to the pubIIc.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.034
You'd be endangering
innocent civilians.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.038
She already killed Paul Dirkson.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.071
This might be our one shot
to flush her out.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.340
We'll have armed agents
posing as wait staff.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.075
Place will be
100% controlled.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.316
It's a hell of a lot easier

21:28.350 --> 21:31.478
than securing a thousand-seat
auditorium, don't you think?

21:32.620 --> 21:35.680
I think... maybe Jimmy Kimmel.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.049
All right, go. Go.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.320
Thank you.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.630
Two subjects
approaching the front door.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.877
AL :
Couple right behind them.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.043
Dimka's a dignified man, Dennis.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.617
Stop slouching.

22:01.650 --> 22:04.084
Very nice. Thank you.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.419
_ WAITER: _
HI, can I get you guys anythIng?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.052
Two dry cappuccinos.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.580
AL:
Bunch of hipsters coming in.

22:32.610 --> 22:36.046
May I have
a menu, please?

22:36.080 --> 22:38.082
WAITER: _
Two dry cappuccmos.

22:39.990 --> 22:42.879
You call this dry?

22:42.920 --> 22:44.126
Dry is no milk.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.457
Just foam.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.618
Is this your first day
on the job or what?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.719
WAITER:
I'm so sorry about that.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.067
Let me take care of it
for you. Excuse me.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.499
Thank you.

23:05.850 --> 23:07.715
CARRIE:
That's her.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.412
That's her! That's her!
That's her!

23:10.450 --> 23:11.109
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

23:11.150 --> 23:12.412
Hey, hey, he !
Oh, my God)!

23:12.450 --> 23:13.417
He's having a heart attack!

23:13.460 --> 23:15.416
Somebody please,
uh, help him.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.087
He's having a heart attack!

23:18.090 --> 23:20.524
Doctor!
Someone get a doctor!

23:35.210 --> 23:37.405
Come on!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.968
Hmm.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.070
Hey. Any luck?

24:13.110 --> 24:14.748
It's like Jackie
just vanIshed.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.748
We got traffic cams on
Commerce, on Bedford.

24:16.780 --> 24:17.781
Nothing.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.209
She must've known our coverage
patterns beforehand.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.649
Impressive.

24:21.690 --> 24:23.521
Might want to save
some of that admiration

24:23.560 --> 24:24.652
for the EMTs.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.988
Turns out the undercover she
p0Isoned Is gonna be okay.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.554
They had an
antidote on hand.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.999
Really dodged a bullet
on that one.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.895
Can't _count on Dimka
beIng so lucky.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.160
We got to find Jackie
before his award ceremony.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.497
This might help.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.996
Finally finished the back-trace

24:37.040 --> 24:39.235
on the St. Laurent Hotel's
WI-FI system.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.204
Turns out the device
you found in Dirkson's room

24:41.240 --> 24:43.276
was transmitting
a signal to an IP address

24:43.310 --> 24:44.902
in your old
stomping ground, Queens.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.202
The Luxury Sweets Motel.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.878
Yeah, we did a vice bust there
a few years ago.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.842
Not a lot of luxury
and there wasn't a suite

24:51.890 --> 24:53.812
within five miles of the place.

24:53.860 --> 24:54.986
Plus, I heard
they got a special rate

24:55.020 --> 24:56.112
for international assassins.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.752
Let's find out. Call for backup.

24:57.790 --> 24:58.950
Carrie and I'll meet them there.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.628
No lights, no sirens.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.855
You got it.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.864
CARRIE:
Local cops have eyes on the room
and report no movement.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.902
MAN : Stand by.
Right. We'll be waiting.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.100
Bye.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.279
ESU should be
here any minute.

25:14.310 --> 25:15.868
I don't know.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.908
So, that song contest
you won on the radio.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.577
What was the winning tune?

25:22.620 --> 25:25.043
You want to talk
about that now?

25:25.090 --> 25:26.284
Yeah, why not?

25:26.320 --> 25:29.187
Uh, "Truly Madly Deeply"
by Savage Garden.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.858
Hmm, don't know it.

25:30.890 --> 25:31.982
What? Yes, you do.

25:32.030 --> 25:32.985
We danced to it.

25:33.030 --> 25:36.227
So, we danced
to it once, I...

25:36.260 --> 25:37.864
Oh, wow.
You know...

25:37.900 --> 25:39.026
maybe if you sing it.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.630
No way. No.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.989
Yeah, just sing a little.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.564
"Face your fears," right?

25:44.610 --> 25:45.759
Face my fears? Fine.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.903
I'll sing it
if you go skydiving.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.805
All right, deal.
Really?

25:49.840 --> 25:50.909
Yeah.
Oh.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.872
And we danced to it
three times.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.342
Four, actually.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.712
All right, let's hear it.

25:57.750 --> 25:58.842
Come on.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.216
Come on.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.319
Aah!

26:03.360 --> 26:04.622
No.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.154
* I'll be your dream,
I'll be your wish *

26:10.200 --> 26:12.327
* I'll be your fantasy

26:12.370 --> 26:14.861
* I'll be your hope,
I'll be your love *

26:14.900 --> 26:16.094
* Be everything

26:16.140 --> 26:18.335
BOTH:
* That you need.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.735
You do remember.

26:19.770 --> 26:22.330
Of course I remember.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.909
Ah.

26:27.950 --> 26:28.974
Perfect timing--
they're here.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.009
Let's go.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.788
Go, go.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.298
MAN:
Bathroom clear!

26:50.300 --> 26:52.029
Looks like she left
in a hurry.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.139
CARRIE:
Yeah.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.957
Hey, did we find the desk clerk

27:07.990 --> 27:09.309
who checked her in?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.021
Name's Larry Yablonski.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.925
Manager says he hasn't
seen him since yesterday.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.154
Well, let's find him.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.692
Oh, and, uh...
get CSU here.

27:17.730 --> 27:20.062
Have them go over
the room, okay?

27:20.100 --> 27:22.967
And... then_have _them
go over It agaIn.

27:27.410 --> 27:28.934
Eliot's at the university.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.972
He wants us there
for the securIty walk-through.

27:32.010 --> 27:34.911
Okay.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.950
So all the_manholes are
secured, maIIboxes removed,

27:41.990 --> 27:43.753
abandoned vehicles towed?

27:43.790 --> 27:44.859
Good.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.380
_ And call
LIeutenant Branson.

27:46.430 --> 27:48.796
Make sure they have
no police uniforms missing.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.821
Oh, by the looks
on your faces,

27:50.870 --> 27:52.360
I take it you're not
bearing good news?

27:52.400 --> 27:54.163
She was gone
before we got there.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.191
Can't catch a break.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.061
Aanay, on to plan "B."
Floor plans.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.930
We'll take a walk-through,
get you up to speed.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.732
When do I get
one of those?

28:02.780 --> 28:04.099
You just got out of Queens
for God's sake.

28:09.850 --> 28:10.782
Yeah.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.448
Looks like we got your hotel
clerk Yablonski.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.856
Patrol out of the 1-4
found him in a Dumpster.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.755
Single shot between the eyes.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.258
This lady of yours covers
her tracks, that's for sure.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.121
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

28:24.270 --> 28:26.261
*

28:57.130 --> 28:59.462
*

29:34.370 --> 29:35.530
Carrie, how much
would you bid

29:35.570 --> 29:37.492
on a silver inlaid
cat food dish?

29:37.540 --> 29:39.269
Oh, I-I didn't know
you had a cat.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.459
I don't.
Oh.

29:40.510 --> 29:42.034
Well, then I think
you're good right there.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.138
Okay.

29:43.180 --> 29:46.343
Jo, you had any unusual
deaths in the past 24 hours?

29:46.380 --> 29:49.178
Carrie, they're
all unusual deaths.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.484
We come into the world in the
dullest, most unIform of ways,

29:51.520 --> 29:55.058
but our exits are like...
ooh...

29:55.090 --> 29:56.079
forensic snowflakes.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.280
Aw, yeah, your students

29:57.320 --> 29:59.083
at the New School must
really eat that up.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.997
"Poetry from the Slab"
over-registers every year.

30:02.030 --> 30:03.190
So...

30:03.230 --> 30:04.959
what unusual thing
can I do for you?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.992
Well, Jackie-- she eliminates
anyone who gets in her way.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.600
So I'm thinking maybe
she ran into another...

30:10.640 --> 30:13.108
obstacle.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.074
Well, it's been pretty dull

30:15.110 --> 30:18.238
around here, homicide-wise.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.009
Not that I mind.

30:20.050 --> 30:21.972
Okay, this guy was whacked

30:22.020 --> 30:23.544
by his son
because he wouldn't

30:23.580 --> 30:24.410
let him go to a rave.

30:24.450 --> 30:27.578
And yet he let him play
with a .30-06.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.588
Go figure.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.258
This guy...

30:31.290 --> 30:33.520
male, single gunshot wound

30:33.560 --> 30:35.551
to the head, Queens.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.249
We're assuming, uh...

30:37.300 --> 30:39.461
a robbery of some sort...
Single gunshot wound
to the head.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.626
Where in Queens?

30:40.670 --> 30:42.592
Uh... Flushing.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.164
Does it say where he worked?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.939
Uh...

30:45.970 --> 30:48.200
Black Kitty Cyber Caf,
Roosevelt Avenue.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.147
AL:
Looks like she left in a hurry.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.113
Jackie was there at the caf.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.388
The assassin?

31:03.420 --> 31:05.285
Yes. Thank you, Jo.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.126
Oh.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.651
I still can't believe
Zach's gone.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.260
I mean, Ijust saw him
two days ago.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.120
He looked so happy
and together.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.990
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.190
No, everybody
loved Zach.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.605
We used to call him
the Mayor of Flushing.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.677
He and his boyfriend were
gonna get married next month.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.201
You recognize
this woman?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.673
Yeah. Yeah, she came in
a couple of times.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.349
Did you ever see Zach
talking to her?

31:29.380 --> 31:31.245
Zach talked
to everyone.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.453
Um, last time she came in,
she hung out on that computer

31:34.490 --> 31:37.015
over there in the corner.
I remember 'cause

31:37.060 --> 31:39.221
she made this big stink
about wanting privacy.

31:39.260 --> 31:41.296
You mind if we take a look?
Yeah, go for it.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.699
Any luck, she left something
behind in the trash.

31:44.730 --> 31:47.028
Yeah, I think these places empty
the trash after every session.

31:47.070 --> 31:47.889
Okay. Let's try

31:47.940 --> 31:49.692
the search history.
I think they strip

31:49.740 --> 31:51.105
the search history, too.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.266
They strip the cache?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.368
What?
Ah,

31:53.410 --> 31:55.037
something you
don't know about.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.138
My nephew got busted

31:56.180 --> 31:58.341
last month for looking
at porn because

31:58.380 --> 32:01.178
he forgot to clear the cache
on the family computer.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.346
Not a mistake
that you would make.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.244
Mm.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.417
We just have to find

32:04.450 --> 32:06.941
what was accessed on Wednesday.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.218
Here we go.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.455
Tuesday, Wednesday.

32:10.490 --> 32:11.684
Bingo.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.526
That's the performing
arts center

32:14.560 --> 32:16.221
at Hudson University.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.191
Press clearance list

32:20.230 --> 32:22.289
for Dimka's speech.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.193
Jackie's going as...

32:23.240 --> 32:25.231
A journalist.

33:03.780 --> 33:06.442
World peace really packs 'em in.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.778
Yeah, Justin Bieber's
got nothing on this guy.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.412
We've positively I.D.'d

33:10.450 --> 33:12.179
17 female journalists
on the press list.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.211
All are accounted for but one.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.410
Her name's Andrea Weston,
with the Post.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.279
You go to her place?
Yeah, she's not there.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.129
Not answering her
cell phone either.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.596
All right. So Jackie's
coming as Andrea Weston.

33:22.630 --> 33:23.790
Ah, don't worry.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.024
Genghis Khan couldn't
get through here.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.233
Take it.

33:28.270 --> 33:29.692
What's up, Jay?

33:29.740 --> 33:31.401
Hey, CSU just
got done processing

33:31.440 --> 33:32.407
that motel room in Queens.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.704
Even though the place
looks like a frat house,

33:34.740 --> 33:36.674
there's not a single print,
hair, DNA sample

33:36.710 --> 33:38.678
to be found.
What?

33:38.710 --> 33:41.110
CSU Tech called it flawless.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.572
Well, not exactly flawless.
I mean, she left

33:42.620 --> 33:44.247
that wrapper there
that led us to

33:44.290 --> 33:47.509
the Inter... net caf that...

33:47.550 --> 33:49.552
Wait a minute.

33:55.330 --> 33:58.390
She planted that wrapper.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.398
She wanted me to find the caf,

34:00.430 --> 34:03.399
the computer, the list
of journalists, all of it.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.307
She... she was counting on it.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.466
I don't understand.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.068
Why would she give away
her plan?

34:10.380 --> 34:12.405
Because it's not her plan.

34:12.450 --> 34:13.405
She's here.

34:13.450 --> 34:15.475
I got to go.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.812
CROWD :
Dimka! Dimka!

34:18.850 --> 34:22.479
Dimka! Dimka! Dimka! Dimka!

34:33.230 --> 34:35.494
I was supposed to be here
a half hour ago,

34:35.540 --> 34:36.859
but someone slashed my tires.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.300
It's not her.
We got the real Andrea Weston.

34:39.340 --> 34:39.829
Jackie set us up.

34:39.870 --> 34:40.837
Yeah, I know.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.269
You do?

34:42.310 --> 34:44.141
Well, you could've told me.
Where are you?

34:44.180 --> 34:46.171
I am in the auditorium, Al.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.349
All right, let me know
if you see anything.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.439
I'm gonna secure the perimeter.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.404
Al, I think I got something.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.169
I'm heading up
to the catwalk to check it out.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.189
Carrie?

35:25.220 --> 35:27.381
Carrie, repeat.

35:27.420 --> 35:30.184
Carrie, you're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.882
Dimka! Dimka! Dimka!

35:44.210 --> 35:47.702
And now,
it's my honor and pleasure

35:47.740 --> 35:49.901
to introduce the man himself,

35:49.940 --> 35:52.545
Dr. Okoro Dimka.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.898
Thank you. Thank you very much.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.773
Thank you very, very, very much.

36:22.810 --> 36:25.802
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.704
Please sit down.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.388
DIMKA:
My frIends,

36:33.420 --> 36:35.888
you are very kind.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.957
I'd like to thank you all

36:38.990 --> 36:40.878
for the great privilege

36:40.930 --> 36:43.728
of being invited here today.

36:56.410 --> 36:58.446
Get Dimka off the stage.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.675
Repeat:
Target is in the building.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.438
And there is...
Mr. Dimka, come with me.

37:20.570 --> 37:23.038
I was hoping
never to see you again.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.628
Likewise.

37:48.460 --> 37:50.428
You know the drill.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.018
Drop your weapon.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.993
It's ceramic.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.996
Oh.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.066
I'll be sure to add it
to my steak set.

38:01.110 --> 38:03.977
If you taught your undercovers
how to make better cappuccino,

38:04.010 --> 38:06.046
you could've avoided
all this trouble.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.378
And a few lives, right?
Mm.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.071
It's all about preparation.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.610
That's the key.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.742
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

38:13.790 --> 38:16.350
How do you say
"Go to hell" in Russian?

38:16.390 --> 38:18.381
Oh.

38:19.390 --> 38:21.722
As I said, preparation.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.767
No! No, no, no, no, no!

38:29.800 --> 38:31.028
Oh...

38:31.070 --> 38:32.435
No, no, no, no.

38:34.510 --> 38:36.831
Damn it!

38:42.920 --> 38:45.081
She's dead.

39:04.510 --> 39:07.138
You okay?

39:07.170 --> 39:09.138
Yeah. Dimka?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.603
AL: He's fine.
We're all fine.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.116
Come here, boy.
Come here. Hey.

39:16.150 --> 39:19.039
Oh, you lost your partner, huh?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.609
All right.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.049
There you go.
There you go.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.396
Al, that dog was lying dead
a half hour ago.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.964
I saw him.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.841
WEBSTER:
It's a genetically engineered
pharmaceutical

39:46.880 --> 39:47.801
that hospitals use

39:47.850 --> 39:51.684
_ in minute d_oses _
to Induce comas In patIents.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.883
She couldn't bring herself
to kill the dog,

39:54.920 --> 39:57.411
so she gave him
a small dose.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.189
Enough to knock him out.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.118
Hey, give me your radio.
Can you take this dog?

40:01.160 --> 40:02.525
Oh, my God.
Central,

40:02.560 --> 40:03.697
emergency message.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.595
I need that ambulance
that just took off.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.188
10-1.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.599
DISPATCHER :
10-1, urgent. Call your command.

40:19.650 --> 40:22.141
Acknowledge.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.977
10-1, urgent. Call your command.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.443
Do you copy?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.048
10-1, acknowledge.

40:28.090 --> 40:29.580
What's your location?

40:29.620 --> 40:30.951
Do you copy?

40:30.990 --> 40:35.051
* I'm growing like a seed

40:35.100 --> 40:39.025
* Rain's been falling on me

40:39.070 --> 40:42.164
* I've been covered in cold...

40:42.200 --> 40:44.236
Dimka's safely on a plane

40:44.270 --> 40:45.806
back to West Africa.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.467
He extends his thanks.
Well, tell him

40:47.510 --> 40:49.603
to keep his head down; we still
can't raise that ambulance.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.232
Got units and air patrol
out looking.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.169
You know how rare it is to stop
an Alpha Five operation?

40:54.210 --> 40:55.848
So, what, round one
to the good guys?

40:55.880 --> 40:56.847
My guess,

40:56.880 --> 40:58.142
if Jackie's alive,

40:58.180 --> 41:00.148
she'll think twice
before coming back our way.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.179
I hope so.

41:01.220 --> 41:02.812
In fact, I'm counting on it.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.487
Good work, both of you.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.521
Yeah?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.490
Okay, thanks.

41:11.530 --> 41:15.489
* Yes, I can feel

41:15.540 --> 41:19.032
* Feel it all...

41:19.070 --> 41:21.834
We found the ambulance.
No trace of Jackie.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.177
Why am I not surprised?

41:23.210 --> 41:24.677
I should've seen
thIs comIng.

41:24.710 --> 41:27.008
FBI's got it out nationally.
We'll get her.

41:27.050 --> 41:28.278
MURRAY:
Maybe not.

41:28.310 --> 41:30.949
TSA out at Kennedy
just sent us this.

41:32.250 --> 41:33.945
From a gate at
Bolivian Airlines.

41:33.990 --> 41:35.787
Flight to Bogot

41:35.820 --> 41:38.186
six hours ago.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.289
Okay, great.
We can interdict the flight.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.752
It landed
50 minutes ago.

41:40.790 --> 41:41.757
She's gone.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.153
There's got to be a way.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.761
Al, we can't just let her go.

41:47.800 --> 41:48.937
You saved Dimka.

41:48.970 --> 41:49.994
That's what matters.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.305
Tell that to her next victim.

41:53.340 --> 41:56.537
* I'm looking to the sky

41:56.580 --> 42:00.607
* And I'll be listening
to the stars *

42:00.650 --> 42:04.040
* And maybe thinking of you,
and wondering where you are. *
