00:00.381 --> 00:02.652
Previously on Californication...

00:02.653 --> 00:04.667
If you were gonna have
sex with someone

00:04.668 --> 00:09.036
and you knew that it would be
the absolute last time,

00:09.037 --> 00:12.580
- what do you think it would be like?
- Incredibly sad.

00:12.581 --> 00:14.291
Make me sad.

00:14.292 --> 00:16.003
Who the fuck are you?

00:16.004 --> 00:17.911
Stu Baggs, nice to meet you.

00:17.912 --> 00:20.899
- I met the wife.
- Soon, to be ex. Splitsville.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.120
So you wouldn't mind if
I took a crack at her?

00:23.876 --> 00:25.631
- You know how many women I slept with?
- Unh-uh

00:25.632 --> 00:28.352
I gotta get it up to a 100.

00:28.353 --> 00:31.161
Triple digits.
Then I can die happy.

00:31.162 --> 00:33.609
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm gonna be a father!

00:33.610 --> 00:35.376
I'm carrying Charlie's baby.

00:35.377 --> 00:37.180
- What?
- What the fuck?

00:37.181 --> 00:40.392
You know what I think, Dad?
I think it's all gonna be okay.

00:40.393 --> 00:43.671
Chapters end.
Sometimes you gotta shake things up.

00:43.672 --> 00:47.020
Check out of this dump.
Go home.

<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny & lada18</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:03.725 --> 01:05.441
Amazing.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.049
A goddess.

01:10.232 --> 01:12.513
A gift from on high.

01:13.328 --> 01:18.603
You deserve the white dress
and a happy ending.

01:25.709 --> 01:28.891
Are we gonna take this thing
to the next level or what?

01:28.892 --> 01:30.604
Uh? What?

01:30.605 --> 01:32.803
- We are coming up on the Internet.
- Really?

01:32.804 --> 01:37.324
- Time certainly doth fly.
- We kept it pretty cas.

01:37.325 --> 01:41.851
I've been pretty careful about making sure
I don't make any demands on your time.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.329
- I Don't want to be that girl.
- Oh you've been a great "not-that-girl".

01:44.330 --> 01:49.215
I just want to know what you
see us becoming... eventually.

01:52.163 --> 01:56.937
I see us becoming incredibly close.

01:56.938 --> 02:00.193
Great friends... eventually.

02:00.194 --> 02:03.457
After the part where you hate
my guts for a long, cold winter.

02:03.458 --> 02:07.538
It's not that I'm not fond of you.
I am. Inordinately so.

02:07.539 --> 02:11.354
It's just that I enjoy the casual
nature of things. I'm a casual guy.

02:11.355 --> 02:13.329
You know, I have to be
because I'm damaged,

02:13.330 --> 02:17.114
broken, really. You know,
old dog, new tricks.

02:17.115 --> 02:21.262
But you - you're amazing. A goddess.
A gift from on high.

02:21.263 --> 02:23.314
You deserve the white dress
and the happy ending.

02:23.315 --> 02:25.050
I'm just not the guy
to give it to you.

02:25.051 --> 02:27.930
I see you're mad.
I can tell.

02:27.931 --> 02:29.497
I'm not mad.

02:29.498 --> 02:31.889
You're not?
Oh, I'm glad.

02:31.890 --> 02:35.698
It's just you fucked me
in the ass, Hank.

02:35.699 --> 02:37.538
Oh, are we speaking metaphorically?
Because ...

02:37.539 --> 02:40.658
No, I gave up the butt for you.
Do you think I would have let you

02:40.659 --> 02:43.185
sodomize me if I didn't
think there was a future here?

02:43.186 --> 02:45.664
You did say that you liked it
more than you thought you would.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.741
- Well that's not the point.
- That's not the point.

02:49.232 --> 02:50.719
This man's a monster.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.451
He likes to fuck women in the ass

02:53.452 --> 02:56.704
and then tell them that he just
wants to keep it casual.

Who callin' my phone?

03:18.153 --> 03:19.912
It's yo agent.

03:19.913 --> 03:23.895
Calling from the coast with the
prospect of a significant payday.

03:23.896 --> 03:27.087
- I'll take it.
- Don't you wanna know what it is?

03:27.088 --> 03:31.656
No. Can you book me out on the nextest
flight to this coast of which you speak?

03:31.657 --> 03:34.348
Oh-oh. What happened?
What did you do?

03:34.349 --> 03:37.244
I've got kind of a bunny
boiler situation happening.

03:37.245 --> 03:39.531
She's got a key to my place.

03:39.532 --> 03:42.640
I may need to crash on the villa
for a few days. Is that cool?

03:42.641 --> 03:45.471
Hey, mi casa, amigo. I'll even
pick you up at the airport.

03:45.472 --> 03:47.604
Thanks, Runks.
Much appresh.

03:47.605 --> 03:50.572
I'm looking forward to it buddy.
I've missed yo' black ass.

03:50.573 --> 03:52.644
Later, masturbator.

04:21.516 --> 04:24.899
Oh shit. Did I just do
what I think I just did?

04:24.900 --> 04:26.311
Yes.

04:26.312 --> 04:29.296
- You did.
- I am so truly madly deeply sorry.

04:29.297 --> 04:33.492
I know and that doesn't change the
fact that I now have a puddle in my lap.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.688
One could argue that it's not entirely
my fault that you force grown men

04:37.689 --> 04:40.808
to make huge puddles in your lap.

04:40.809 --> 04:43.027
- I'm not laughing.
- Sure you are.

04:43.028 --> 04:46.224
Little bit?
On the inside, maybe?

04:46.225 --> 04:48.944
Okay I have it, thanks.

04:48.945 --> 04:51.947
- Man, what are the odds?
- Of what?

04:51.948 --> 04:54.712
Usually, I get on the plane and
I'm seated next to John Candy

04:54.713 --> 04:57.632
or Ruth Gordon, if I'm lucky.

04:57.633 --> 05:00.640
But I end up next to the most beautiful
woman in the tri-state area,

05:00.641 --> 05:02.807
and I go and spill a drink in her lap.

05:02.808 --> 05:08.007
Nice work, huh?
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.877
The tri-state area?

05:09.878 --> 05:12.958
You're world class,
you're runway caliber.

05:12.959 --> 05:17.006
You're so beautiful you're almost ugly.
I just didn't want it to go into your head. Hank.

05:17.007 --> 05:20.221
2A.
That's me, sorry.

05:20.222 --> 05:22.427
Well you better be, pal.

05:23.438 --> 05:26.574
- Oh God. I'm sorry.
- No no no, hold on... hold on a second.

05:26.575 --> 05:28.654
Can't you just take her seat?

05:28.655 --> 05:33.035
If the ticket says 2A, then 2A
is where I'm parking my posterior.

05:34.315 --> 05:36.554
Real stickler for the rules, this guy.

05:36.555 --> 05:39.031
That's how we keep the
trains running on time. Choo choo.

05:40.478 --> 05:43.981
- Nice to meet you, Hank.
- Bye, Miss never got your name.

05:43.982 --> 05:45.891
Excuse me.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.144
Sorry.

05:56.604 --> 05:59.072
I have got to get this under control.

05:59.073 --> 06:01.364
I'm almost too fat to fly.

06:04.288 --> 06:06.936
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.

06:07.888 --> 06:09.919
Sorry, sorry.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.264
- Go ahead before I shit myself.
- Excuse me?

06:13.265 --> 06:15.168
Go, go sit with your wife.

06:15.169 --> 06:18.176
She guilted me into swapping with you.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.516
Enjoy the fucking honeymoon.

06:23.697 --> 06:26.136
It's almost like the pursuit
of this one woman,

06:26.137 --> 06:29.767
this one relationship became
its own form of heroin.

06:29.768 --> 06:30.979
I was strung out.

06:31.135 --> 06:35.495
You know, I was driving her
crazy making my kid miserable.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.196
When you finally give up and let go,
good stuff starts to happen.

06:38.282 --> 06:41.431
She's better now.
My kid's fantastic.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.845
I'm keeping it simple.

06:44.952 --> 06:47.959
Such a sad sweet tale of woe.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.496
I'm surprised you made it
through the whole thing.

06:49.497 --> 06:52.781
I thought I might try to hang
yourself there at some point.

06:52.782 --> 06:54.524
You know I actually
did think about it,

06:54.525 --> 06:58.656
but I figured, you know, that'd kind of rude
since you were pouring your heart out and all.

06:58.657 --> 07:00.778
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

07:00.779 --> 07:03.238
But you know, this has been nice to

07:03.239 --> 07:07.096
actually have a conversation with someone
who isn't trying to get in my pants.

07:07.097 --> 07:11.052
You mean my epic love story for the ages
isn't pure panty-peeler?

07:13.187 --> 07:16.355
Okay. Excuse me, I'm gonna go
to the little girls' room.

07:16.356 --> 07:19.437
Well, if you don't want me to try
to get in your pants don't talk dirty to me.

07:19.438 --> 07:23.027
You know I really hope that
no one comes in on me.

07:24.013 --> 07:27.197
- Lock the door.
- See, that's the thing.

07:28.141 --> 07:30.115
I always forget.

08:04.223 --> 08:05.953
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

08:05.954 --> 08:07.958
I'm sorry, I thought you...

08:07.959 --> 08:09.383
I'm just kidding.

08:11.109 --> 08:13.229
I thought you had to pee.

08:13.937 --> 08:15.984
I already did.

08:15.985 --> 08:17.978
I'm sorry I've missed that.

08:25.908 --> 08:27.812
Have you done this before?

08:27.813 --> 08:30.820
Kiss the girl?
Couple of times.

08:32.134 --> 08:35.326
- In an airplane bathroom?
- Believe it or not, no.

08:35.327 --> 08:37.246
It always seemed more trouble
than it was worth it.

08:37.246 --> 08:40.565
Now, that I'm here I think I was just
holding off for the right gal.

08:44.105 --> 08:47.899
For the love of Christ.
Save it for the honeymoon suite.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.237
I have serious work
I gotta do in here.

08:50.838 --> 08:55.486
Thanks for pretty much
the best flight ever.

08:55.487 --> 08:57.265
You're very welcome.

08:57.972 --> 09:01.268
I guess we shouldn't ruin it
by keeping in touch or anything.

09:01.269 --> 09:03.377
I couldn't agree more.

09:03.378 --> 09:06.520
You know what they say: What happens
in the small cramped toilet,

09:06.521 --> 09:08.209
stays in the small cramped toilet.

09:08.210 --> 09:11.793
That's one of my favorite sayings,
right up there with "Eating ain't cheap."

09:11.794 --> 09:14.910
You it's been a long time since
I just made out with a guy.

09:14.911 --> 09:17.145
- Your dirty slut.
- I know.

09:17.146 --> 09:19.535
- It's kinda hot, though.
- Hot.

09:19.536 --> 09:21.533
Maybe we should do it again some time.

09:21.534 --> 09:23.550
With more room to move
one's extremities.

09:23.551 --> 09:27.126
You did not experience my best work, lady.
I've got some serious moves.

09:27.127 --> 09:30.496
I need to be able to
extend and retract.

09:30.497 --> 09:33.395
I gotta loosen up if I some...
Maybe I should get your number.

09:33.419 --> 09:34.466
Hold on.

09:34.739 --> 09:36.479
I can never work
this thing. Hey.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.278
Come on, cock-blocker.

09:38.279 --> 09:39.849
Roll down the window.

09:40.950 --> 09:41.708
Hey.

09:46.578 --> 09:48.690
Little Runks.

09:48.691 --> 09:52.598
Up high for uncle Hank.
You can do it. My man.

09:54.265 --> 09:55.874
How you doing, man?

09:56.652 --> 09:59.485
- He talking yet?
- No, not a word.

09:59.486 --> 10:01.723
Marsty tell me it's totally normal.

10:01.724 --> 10:04.244
- How old now?
- Two point five.

10:04.245 --> 10:08.219
- Totally not normal, Charlie.
- I know, that's what I keep saying.

10:08.220 --> 10:12.984
It's a sweet ride you got here. I was totally
expecting one of your faggoty little girl cars.

10:12.985 --> 10:14.951
This is how much I've missed you.

10:14.952 --> 10:17.887
Leasing this very expensive
penis extension.

10:17.888 --> 10:20.399
Made me feel closer to my
brother from another mother.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.939
Oh, you sweet, bald, cock
hungry homo, you...

10:22.969 --> 10:25.139
Jeez. Hank, Hank.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.713
He may not say much,
but he's not deaf.

10:27.714 --> 10:31.154
I'm sorry, I just see you,
I get all excited that

10:31.155 --> 10:33.240
words just spill out.

10:44.349 --> 10:45.796
Hank.

10:49.094 --> 10:51.328
Sorry, they all look the same.

10:52.202 --> 10:55.279
- What? In a good way.
- Right. Condescending to the last.

10:55.506 --> 10:58.191
Maybe the houses all
look the same, but you ...

10:58.192 --> 11:00.686
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

11:00.687 --> 11:02.959
Easy, tiger.
Stop it.

11:04.024 --> 11:08.158
I can't believe we haven't fucked
for two years, nine months,

11:08.159 --> 11:09.862
three weeks and...

11:09.863 --> 11:12.601
69 hours. What?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.595
It's a compliment.
I'd still totally do you.

11:14.596 --> 11:15.779
Good to know.

11:15.919 --> 11:18.699
As I recall, it was mish, into doggie,

11:18.700 --> 11:21.669
segued quite seamlessly into cowgirl.

11:21.670 --> 11:23.760
I came twice, you just did once.

11:23.761 --> 11:26.164
A guy remembers these things.
It would appear that I owe you one.

11:26.165 --> 11:28.890
- How are you, Hank?
- Most excellent, thank you.

11:28.891 --> 11:31.671
Are you still keeping it simple
with... what's her name?

11:31.672 --> 11:34.348
No, ended that just
last night, thank you very much.

11:34.349 --> 11:37.470
- Ah, hence the sudden arrival.
- Nonsense.

11:37.471 --> 11:40.109
The business of show has
brought me to the left coast.

11:40.110 --> 11:43.285
And how could I pass up an
opportunity to gaze upon my ladies?

11:43.286 --> 11:45.966
Alas, this one's not
your lady anymore, Hank.

11:45.967 --> 11:48.334
Bates, good to see you wearing
pants. How's it tucking?

11:48.335 --> 11:50.610
That's between me
and your ex baby mama.

11:50.611 --> 11:52.927
She's still my baby mama
and always will be.

11:52.928 --> 11:54.613
Get used to it, that will not change.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.584
Did we do this once before
and it ended in fisticuffs?

11:57.585 --> 12:00.752
Yes, and a good
fisticuffs it was. Epic.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.991
In fact, I think we needed to do it.

12:02.992 --> 12:05.562
Like men in prison.
To get it out of the way.

12:05.563 --> 12:07.926
We had to do the man-dance,
just once, just the taste.

12:08.004 --> 12:11.524
So we can move on with our lives and become
the cold war powers that we are today.

12:11.525 --> 12:13.754
Is that what it was?
Cause I seem to remember

12:13.785 --> 12:18.038
you pissing me off to such an extent
I was left with no choice but to take a swing.

12:18.039 --> 12:20.123
- And I hit you right back, don't forget that part.
- No blood.

12:20.124 --> 12:22.218
- Sizable shiner.
- Yeah, blood's more embarrassing.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.800
Karen had to get you a towel, some ice.
Fresh pair of panties too, right?

12:25.801 --> 12:27.496
Yep, still wearing it.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.674
- How's Becca?
- Wonderful.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.515
- What's that?
- Nothing.

12:33.516 --> 12:35.974
No, that is definitely not nothing.

12:35.975 --> 12:38.946
In fact, that's exactly
the kind of frown I'd give you

12:39.000 --> 12:40.159
if you were trying to bullshit a bullshitter.

12:40.279 --> 12:43.336
It's her fucking boyfriend.
I mean, I wanna kill him, Hank.

12:43.337 --> 12:46.272
I mean I don't wanna kill him,
I want to dismember him.

12:46.273 --> 12:51.362
Slowly. And pour tabasco sauce
in his torn bloody asshole as he dies

12:51.386 --> 12:54.104
screaming for his
mommy and daddy. Yeah.

12:54.182 --> 12:55.493
- Nice.
- Karen.

12:56.578 --> 13:00.060
If you absolutely have to be with
someone else, this is the right guy.

13:00.061 --> 13:02.667
I know.
He's like you.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.277
But awesome.

13:06.016 --> 13:09.331
- That's me.
- Whateva'.

13:09.984 --> 13:12.538
Gross. This is gross.
Cut it out.

13:12.539 --> 13:14.599
Where is she?
What's the story?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.724
I don't know, she didn't
come home last night.

13:16.725 --> 13:19.482
What? What kind of shop are
you running around here?

13:19.483 --> 13:21.552
- That's what I always say.
- I don't know, she's in college, Hank.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.372
I mean you know she stays some nights with
her boyfriend. It's been known to happen.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.137
- What? And she's been having sex with this guy?
- I should hope so.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.475
- Why?
- Because he's hot.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.339
- Who are you?
- He is a real fucking douchebag, but he is.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.005
You know what?
We'll have dinner.

13:36.006 --> 13:39.044
I'll make sure she brings him.
Okay?

13:39.045 --> 13:40.542
Fine, why not?

13:40.543 --> 13:42.177
Dinner with the ex
and her new husband,

13:42.178 --> 13:44.491
my insolent daughter,
her asshole boyfriend.

13:44.492 --> 13:48.213
Fanfuckintastic. This is not shaping
up to be a good trip, not at all..

13:48.240 --> 13:50.146
I've only been in LA a couple of hours

13:50.177 --> 13:52.681
and I'm already supremely
fucking agitated.

13:52.682 --> 13:55.216
Have I told you about how
much money you stand to make?

13:55.217 --> 13:56.851
I don't believe it, Runks.

13:56.852 --> 13:58.988
Nothing is ever that easy and I'm
not jumping through any hoops

13:59.034 --> 14:02.254
to land this thing, whatever
this thing is. What is this thing?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.436
Hello?

14:05.437 --> 14:07.936
Hello, ex-wife?

14:08.690 --> 14:10.636
Hello?

14:10.637 --> 14:12.728
Big time movie producer guy?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.980
- Hello.
- Fuck.

14:16.527 --> 14:18.697
I'm gonna take a piss.

14:19.555 --> 14:23.619
Oooh. Eat that, bitch.
God damn it.

14:24.869 --> 14:27.728
God damn it. No, harder.

14:27.729 --> 14:29.619
Yes.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.366
Charlie, come here.
Charlie. Charlie!

14:37.576 --> 14:39.992
She moaned like that when
you used to munch her out?

14:39.993 --> 14:43.193
Hardly. Of course I never quite
had as many quatloos in the bank.

14:43.194 --> 14:45.515
And an Academy Award on my shelf.

14:45.516 --> 14:48.660
These things had been known to
enhance the female orgasm.

14:48.661 --> 14:51.675
Stuart!
Close your eyes, son!

14:51.676 --> 14:54.229
Charlie?
Hank?

14:54.230 --> 14:56.802
Stuart?
Irma!

14:56.803 --> 14:58.780
Christ on a cross.

15:00.008 --> 15:03.448
Hank?
Oh, so good to see you.

15:04.473 --> 15:07.596
Hey, can we do this a little later
when you lose the wood?

15:07.597 --> 15:10.607
- And wash your face.
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah.

15:10.608 --> 15:13.168
Sorry, and this could be a while.

15:13.169 --> 15:15.320
I just popped a Niagara.

15:15.321 --> 15:18.961
- You mean a Viagra.
- No we call the Niagara around here.

15:18.962 --> 15:21.212
Because my rock hard endowment

15:21.213 --> 15:24.207
makes Marcy gush like Niagara Falls.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.613
- Oh. So Marcy's a squirter now?
- Oh yeah.

15:26.614 --> 15:28.236
Things have really
changed in my absence.

15:28.259 --> 15:32.595
Yeah, Marcy is in the throws of a real
sexual renaissance now, Hank.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.369
- It's exhilarating.
- It's good to hear, it's really good to hear.

15:35.370 --> 15:37.145
But you're too young
to mess with that Niagara shit, Stu.

15:37.176 --> 15:40.208
I know, I know, I just really
like the nine hour boner.

15:40.209 --> 15:43.363
That it makes me feel alive.
You know like get shit done.

15:43.364 --> 15:46.974
What is wrong with you people?
You're like a couple of teenagers.

15:46.975 --> 15:49.729
Yeah well Irma was
supposed to be watching him.

15:49.776 --> 15:53.343
It was a quickie, Runkle,
then we were all going for some froyo.

15:53.344 --> 15:56.526
Speaking of which, why is he
eating these terrible snacks?

15:56.527 --> 15:58.506
Oh settle down, soccer mom.

15:58.507 --> 16:00.784
Hanky. Hug!

16:03.355 --> 16:06.515
- Oh you smell like sex.
- Yes I do.

16:06.516 --> 16:09.311
- And weed.
- Well yeah, Mommy's little helper.

16:09.312 --> 16:12.577
I take a puffsky or two and
I get the sex munchies, you know.

16:12.578 --> 16:15.102
I'm going through a real
sexual renaissance.

16:15.103 --> 16:16.714
I heard.

16:16.715 --> 16:19.394
Irma, what the fuck?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.115
Language, Marcy!

16:21.116 --> 16:23.418
He sneak away.
He always sneak away.

16:23.419 --> 16:26.428
- He so quiet like a mouse.
- Oy Dios mio!

16:26.429 --> 16:29.450
It doesn't have anything to do
with you watching your stories?

16:29.451 --> 16:33.028
El Gordo y La Flaca?
I know all about it, Irma.

16:33.740 --> 16:36.693
I'm calling immigration, motherfucker.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.356
What are you guys doing here?

16:41.357 --> 16:43.245
What are we doing here?
We came for the meeting.

16:43.246 --> 16:47.038
Jesus Runkle, didn't you get
the message? There is no meeting.

16:47.039 --> 16:50.655
He wants Hank to come to him.
One on one. Face time.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.432
Who the fuck is he?

16:52.433 --> 16:55.542
- Samurai Apocalypse.
- What? Huh?

16:55.543 --> 16:58.218
- The rapper?
- Oh, have a little respect, Runkle.

16:58.219 --> 17:00.987
The man has transcended
rap a long ago.

17:00.988 --> 17:03.649
Sam is a producer, businessman,

17:03.688 --> 17:08.374
entrepreneur, humanitarian.
No, he is a major player, Hank. Major.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.324
And I pass.

17:10.325 --> 17:12.196
No no no no no,
you have to take the meeting.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.541
He really is an inspiring human being.

17:14.628 --> 17:18.082
He also has writer approval and he
hasn't liked anyone we've sent him.

17:18.185 --> 17:20.601
First of all, I'm not
auditioning for anyone.

17:20.733 --> 17:24.144
Especially someone who calls
himself Samurai Apocalypse.

17:24.145 --> 17:26.200
Secondly, why wasn't
I first on the list?

17:27.451 --> 17:30.951
- What... well... I wasn't aware...
- Hollywood asshole.

18:09.127 --> 18:11.762
TM. Have you tried?

18:11.763 --> 18:15.505
Truth be told I get more satisfaction
out of a a solid BM.

18:16.521 --> 18:17.716
Thank you, Alfred.

18:18.257 --> 18:21.515
- Alfred, really?
- Fuck yeah, man.

18:21.516 --> 18:23.182
As a kid, I told my ma.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.286
I said: "Mama, when I get
rich and famous, I give me Alfred."

18:26.287 --> 18:29.635
Your ma must be proud, cause you got
yourself a fucking Alfred all right.

18:29.636 --> 18:31.822
I don't even know what the
motherfucker's real name.

18:31.823 --> 18:34.269
I just call him Alfred
and he snatched right to it.

18:34.270 --> 18:37.107
I don't even know if I pay this
motherfucker, he might be my slave.

18:37.108 --> 18:39.040
Take that, white people.

18:39.041 --> 18:42.723
- You know I dug your book, man. For real.
- Thank you.

18:42.724 --> 18:44.752
- The shit was crazy.
- Thanks.

18:44.753 --> 18:49.475
When the chick squirted all over Runkle,
I laughed so hard I almost shit my own pants.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.921
Runkle's always good
for a laugh. And a shart.

18:52.922 --> 18:55.695
Tellin' me? This motherfucker's a
walking Pez dispenser.

18:58.810 --> 19:02.211
- So you read the book? Cool.
- Nigga can't read, man?

19:02.212 --> 19:04.039
Kinda shit that saying
to a brother, yo.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.061
I read yo shit from
cover to cover, man.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.098
Even the boring pretentious parts.

19:08.099 --> 19:10.716
Yo, I think you're the
kind to write my shit.

19:11.612 --> 19:14.500
- What do you have in mind?
- Santa Monica Cop.

19:15.665 --> 19:17.361
I don't know what that means.

19:17.362 --> 19:19.942
Look, man,
I did this rap star already.

19:19.943 --> 19:22.862
Sold gold, platinum,
zirconium: Check.

19:22.863 --> 19:25.691
Got my my own energy drink,
Apocalypse Wild: Check.

19:25.692 --> 19:28.993
Got the badass Scarface crib,
crazy rides,

19:28.994 --> 19:31.921
more pussy a nigga can eat:
Check, check, check.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.107
So what's next? The movies.

19:34.108 --> 19:36.526
I wanna do
my own thing, my own moment.

19:36.527 --> 19:39.600
Santa Monica Cop is my
Eddie Murphy moment right now.

19:39.601 --> 19:43.561
- So it's like Beverly Hills Cop.
- Nah nigga, it's set in Santa Monica.

19:45.031 --> 19:46.734
Okay, I see the difference.

19:46.735 --> 19:50.067
You're a kingmaker, man.
I want to be a king, yo.

19:50.068 --> 19:53.926
- You in?
- I don't know, is not really my thing.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.251
The fuck else do you wanna do?
Write another book?

19:56.252 --> 19:58.836
Fuck that, let's
get paid, motherfucker.

19:58.837 --> 20:02.269
Hey. Get yo sexy
ass over here, mama.

20:05.207 --> 20:07.542
- What's up, mama?
- Hi.

20:08.780 --> 20:10.629
Hank Moody, this is Kali.

20:10.630 --> 20:13.266
Remember this name, Kali,
She's gonna be a star.

20:14.935 --> 20:18.211
Kali, this is Hank Moody.
The writer/rapist.

20:18.976 --> 20:20.767
Nice to meet you, Hank.

20:20.768 --> 20:22.920
- And you.
- Oh God. Sorry.

20:22.921 --> 20:26.116
Didn't mean to get a
puddle on you, sorry.

20:26.117 --> 20:28.177
She keeps it cool for sure, yo.

20:28.891 --> 20:31.146
It looks like you two
are about to fornicate.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.366
Which is typically my cue.

20:33.367 --> 20:36.297
Keep it real up with the feel.
A'ight.

20:36.298 --> 20:37.907
Im'ma keep in touch, Moody.

20:37.908 --> 20:39.931
You can't escape Apocalypse Now, yo.

20:59.046 --> 21:01.295
Hasn't been that long, dad.

21:03.619 --> 21:06.491
- You got that look.
- What look?

21:06.492 --> 21:08.974
The drunken boy crazy look.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.338
Promise you'll be nice.

21:10.361 --> 21:12.593
Nice? What are you talking about?
I'm always nice.

21:12.594 --> 21:14.834
Might wanna get used to this one.

21:14.835 --> 21:17.044
I could see him sticking.

21:17.045 --> 21:20.625
In a shoe maybe. Like an
unpleasant chunk of dog turd.

21:36.624 --> 21:39.304
How old of a man might you be, Tyler?

21:40.243 --> 21:42.792
- I'm 24, Hank.
- 24?

21:43.757 --> 21:45.912
24?

21:45.913 --> 21:49.061
A touch too old for my daughter, don't
you think, maybe? Kind of inappropriate?

21:49.062 --> 21:50.886
- Dad?
- Daughter?

21:50.887 --> 21:52.299
- You're being a dick.
- Am not.

21:52.330 --> 21:53.455
- Am too.
- Am not.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.770
He's not being a dick, baby.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.541
- Baby, really?
- He's just a concerned father,

21:56.564 --> 21:58.525
you know, the two are easily confused.

21:58.599 --> 22:00.814
I don't think age
is an issue here, Hank.

22:00.863 --> 22:03.533
Becca is wise beyond her years.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.016
And I'm nothing if not
somewhat stunted.

22:07.132 --> 22:09.251
That sounds familiar.

22:09.252 --> 22:12.906
Well, Hardy Har Har, Karen.
So funny I forgot to laugh.

22:12.907 --> 22:16.031
I'll take a snifter of that
vino rouge you got there, Tyler.

22:16.281 --> 22:19.280
Oh, sorry, Hank.
Looks like I killed it.

22:19.281 --> 22:22.463
All by yourself?
Again, with the rude, no?

22:22.464 --> 22:27.035
Maybe, but it is incredibly tasty
super Tuscan. Snooze, you loose.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.255
Hank, look...

22:30.256 --> 22:32.001
I get it, I do.

22:32.002 --> 22:35.542
A young, good looking guy swoops in and
starts sniffing around your one and only,

22:35.543 --> 22:38.233
and you questions his motives.
Totally understandable.

22:38.234 --> 22:41.223
But I really like your daughter.

22:41.224 --> 22:44.356
We're having fun,
we're hanging out, keeping it simple...

22:44.357 --> 22:47.360
And I come in peace, okay?
It's all good.

22:47.361 --> 22:49.267
- It's all good?
- Yeah.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.518
- It's all good.
- He's really charming.

22:51.519 --> 22:54.048
You hear that, Karen?
It's all good.

22:54.049 --> 22:56.687
- Yes, it's all good.
- It's all good.

22:56.688 --> 22:58.894
We should go on, babe.
We're going to be late.

22:59.665 --> 23:02.468
Hold on, hold on a sec.
Is anybody gonna say anything?

23:03.369 --> 23:06.120
Okay, It's on me to be
the designated asshole.

23:06.121 --> 23:09.695
You're not really thinking of driving, are you?
You just finished a whole bottle of wine.

23:09.696 --> 23:11.519
Hank, come on.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.548
Who puts wine in the drinking
and driving category?

23:13.549 --> 23:16.451
I don't know, maybe
people who have lost kids

23:16.452 --> 23:20.853
to smarmy little fucks who sucked down
super Tuscans and then got behind the wheel?

23:20.854 --> 23:24.993
And you've certainly never consumed alcohol
and gotten behind the wheel, have you dad?

23:24.994 --> 23:29.363
I have made certain mistakes, Becca.
This has been well documented.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.924
But because of my foolishness,
you don't have to make the same ones.

23:32.925 --> 23:36.349
Great seeing you, dad.
Always a pleasure.

23:36.350 --> 23:37.961
Becca, wait.

23:39.692 --> 23:42.424
See how easy that was?
Problem solved.

23:42.425 --> 23:45.393
She a quite little trouble
stirrer, that one.

23:45.394 --> 23:47.248
It was nice to finally meet you, Hank.

23:47.249 --> 23:49.376
Truly sorry we got off on wrong foot.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.757
- Take care, Karen.
- Bye.

23:54.903 --> 23:58.673
Jesus, even feels like a creep.
Clammy, fucking mitz.

23:58.674 --> 24:00.318
I don't like it.
Not one bit.

24:00.319 --> 24:02.614
Hank, you're here for a couple days.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.403
Is this how you wanna leave
things with your daughter?

24:04.404 --> 24:07.327
I think I'm going to let the grownups hash
this one out. You know where I stand.

24:07.351 --> 24:09.380
I hate his stupid fucking guts.

24:09.381 --> 24:12.839
And I love you for it, Batesy.
Your support means the world to me.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.039
Seriously, I could've
felt you right now.

24:15.172 --> 24:18.063
You know it wouldn't be the first time
a man has tongued my asshole in gratitude.

24:18.094 --> 24:20.455
- Shut up. Just shut up.
- Raincheck.

24:20.456 --> 24:22.693
- He's kidding, right?
- You don't get it, do you?

24:22.717 --> 24:23.873
- What?
- He's you.

24:23.888 --> 24:25.810
Yes. You said so earlier.

24:25.811 --> 24:27.248
He's like me only awesomer.

24:27.310 --> 24:30.661
And I'm not sure I liked the way you phrased it,
but I certainly understand the sentiment.

24:30.695 --> 24:32.577
And I choose to see a compliment
there somewhere.

24:32.593 --> 24:34.849
- Hank, will you shut the fuck up?
- Because I'm a bright side guy.

24:34.850 --> 24:37.868
I'm not talking
about Richard. Tyler.

24:37.869 --> 24:40.907
What? What are you talking about?
The kid is a loathsome fucking asshole.

24:40.908 --> 24:44.885
Well, there are certain members of my family
who said the same thing about you.

24:44.886 --> 24:47.870
Your folks, maybe. Not your sister.
She always dug me.

24:47.871 --> 24:51.310
She used to molest me with her eyes.
Something fierce, I could tell.

24:51.311 --> 24:54.248
Got me a little wet.
I'm not gonna lie.

24:54.326 --> 24:58.998
Wow, I can't believe it has taken me this many years
to realize you ended up with the wrong sister.

24:59.037 --> 25:01.048
Oh, she was a foxy little
minx, that one.

25:01.049 --> 25:02.685
But she didn't turn on my heart light.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.512
So what's the move here, Karen?

25:06.513 --> 25:09.871
- Move? There is no move.
- There's always a move.

25:09.872 --> 25:12.318
She likes him.
He says he likes her.

25:12.319 --> 25:14.328
It works until it doesn't.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.215
That sounds awfully familiar.

25:17.216 --> 25:20.404
I'm not in the mood, Hank.
I'm going back to my life.

25:20.405 --> 25:23.342
Who could blame you?
It's a nice life. What?

25:23.427 --> 25:26.854
You did well for yourself. You got
a white picket fence and everything.

25:26.855 --> 25:28.717
Yep. Home, sweet home.

25:28.718 --> 25:32.477
I know bait when I hear it,
and this little fishy ain't biting.

25:32.478 --> 25:35.658
- Good night.
- Good night, former lover.

26:06.206 --> 26:07.844
One...

26:10.788 --> 26:15.619
hundreeeed!

26:15.620 --> 26:18.185
I win!

26:18.186 --> 26:21.382
Hank! Buddy I didn't
hear you come in.

26:21.383 --> 26:23.166
Hank, this is Ginger.

26:23.167 --> 26:27.904
Ginger, this is my best friend
and star client, Hank Moody.

26:27.905 --> 26:30.157
- Hi, Hank.
- Hey, Ginger.

26:30.158 --> 26:32.885
Any naked friend of Charlie
is a naked friend of mine.

26:38.494 --> 26:40.504
What's with the victory lap, dude?

26:40.505 --> 26:42.370
It's the 100th woman, Hank.

26:42.371 --> 26:45.446
Un ciento, baby.
Remember? My quest.

26:45.447 --> 26:48.536
Oh, wow, it took this
long to get to a 100?

26:49.347 --> 26:51.707
What am I talking about?
Of course it did.

26:51.708 --> 26:56.505
I know, right? But I did it.
I made myself a promise and I kept it.

26:56.506 --> 26:58.499
My heart and cock swell with pride.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.350
Hey, I'm really happy you were here
to see me cross the finish line.

27:01.351 --> 27:04.316
- Me too.
- How was your day, buddy?

27:04.317 --> 27:06.737
It started off all right,
then it got a little weird

27:06.738 --> 27:08.941
and then it just all went
sideways and shitty.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.117
What do you think of
Samurai Apocalypse?

27:11.118 --> 27:14.006
Yeah, can you give me a
ride back to the LAX right now?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.887
Oh, come on.
There's no need to be rash.

27:16.957 --> 27:19.195
Look, you have yourself a drink.

27:20.728 --> 27:22.359
Chillax, enjoy the view.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.207
No, no, that's how it
starts, Charlie. Stop.

27:29.358 --> 27:30.845
Who dis?

27:31.746 --> 27:34.203
Oh. Who?

27:34.639 --> 27:35.905
Oh, yeah?

27:36.651 --> 27:38.491
Wait, what?

27:38.492 --> 27:40.166
Say that again.

27:41.142 --> 27:43.957
Wow. Wow.

27:45.782 --> 27:47.420
Oh, okay.

27:50.170 --> 27:53.734
Well, thanks for calling.
I guess.

27:55.167 --> 27:58.546
- Who dat?
- My neighbor back in New York.

27:58.547 --> 28:00.466
Everything okay?

28:02.446 --> 28:04.583
My apartment's on fire.
