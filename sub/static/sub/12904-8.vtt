00:00.190 --> 00:02.529
Karen, Vivian is 4 months old,
and you've already

00:02.549 --> 00:04.929
had three nannies
who haven't worked out?

00:04.949 --> 00:07.140
Who are you waiting for? Mary Poppins?

00:07.160 --> 00:08.460
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:08.480 --> 00:11.602
Hi, I'm Josselyn Carver,
and I'm in public relations,

00:11.622 --> 00:13.523
and I honestly think
I could have you on the cover

00:13.557 --> 00:14.914
of Rolling Stone in a year.

00:14.934 --> 00:17.193
Your show was amazing.
You're basically famous.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.962
Your face was on billboards.

00:18.996 --> 00:19.929
Really?

00:19.964 --> 00:22.131
April: Oh, Mom, you have
a drinking problem,

00:22.166 --> 00:24.267
and the fact that you still
don't see that...

00:24.301 --> 00:26.469
I can't see what isn't there.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.338
So, how'd it go with Joss and Harry?

00:28.372 --> 00:30.006
They're totally cool with it.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.207
Huh.

00:31.241 --> 00:32.208
They understand.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.977
A car crash?

00:34.011 --> 00:35.678
What happened? Is she okay?

00:39.650 --> 00:42.051
Look at that. Five minutes
to spare, and I'd say

00:42.086 --> 00:44.187
the place looks pretty Grandma-ready.

00:44.221 --> 00:45.955
- Don't you think?
- You're sure she's okay?

00:45.990 --> 00:47.624
Well, she's a little banged up.

00:47.658 --> 00:49.192
- She broke her wrist?
- Well, her arm.

00:49.226 --> 00:50.994
But she's tough. She'll heal.

00:51.028 --> 00:52.228
What about her car?

00:52.262 --> 00:53.429
- Does she have to get a new one?
- Maybe.

00:53.464 --> 00:55.365
- Were there people in the other car...
- Hey. Luce, Luce.

00:55.399 --> 00:57.233
Relax. Take a breath here.

00:57.267 --> 00:59.135
- [Sighs]
- Everything's gonna be okay.

00:59.169 --> 01:01.137
Your mom's taking your grandma
to the best doctor

01:01.171 --> 01:03.172
in California,
and I bet you she'll be back

01:03.207 --> 01:05.241
at those weekly golf games
of hers in no time.

01:05.275 --> 01:07.877
Okay, but did you put
extra pillows on her bed?

01:07.911 --> 01:10.513
- [Car doors close]
- Of course I did.

01:10.547 --> 01:12.315
- I'll just go double-check.
- Okay.

01:12.349 --> 01:14.817
And Lucy is already talking
about law school.

01:14.852 --> 01:18.988
Oh, it's been too long
since I've seen that sweet face!

01:19.023 --> 01:22.025
Hey, Marjorie! So good to see you again.

01:22.059 --> 01:24.694
Mwah! Let me get your bags for you.

01:24.728 --> 01:26.095
We made up our bedroom for you,

01:26.130 --> 01:28.364
and we don't want to hear
any arguments about it.

01:28.399 --> 01:30.199
Well, where else would you
have me sleep? On the floor?

01:30.234 --> 01:33.936
- [Laughter]
- Mom. Marc was just being nice.

01:33.971 --> 01:35.605
Just so you know, I wasn't drinking

01:35.639 --> 01:37.907
during the car accident,
so I don't want to hear

01:37.941 --> 01:40.576
any of your AA crap while
I'm here. You got it?

01:42.279 --> 01:43.179
[Laughter]

01:43.213 --> 01:46.015
Aww. We're just so glad
that you're here.

01:46.050 --> 01:48.201
I'm just gonna check on some pillows.

01:49.386 --> 01:50.920
Okay, so, I'm on the debate team now.

01:50.954 --> 01:53.222
No! You are? Yes! Because of you!

01:53.257 --> 01:54.557
Oh, I can't wait. You're gonna win.

01:54.591 --> 01:55.858
Well, of course I will. I'll coach you.

01:55.893 --> 01:57.927
[Laughing] Yes!

[Sighs]

02:05.235 --> 02:06.680
I need to talk to you.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.604
I mean, seriously,
how am I still on hold?

02:08.639 --> 02:10.073
Okay, I've binge-watched "Catastrophe"

02:10.107 --> 02:11.207
and ordered a birthday cake from Paris

02:11.241 --> 02:13.109
in the time it's taken
Variety to ignore my call.

02:13.143 --> 02:15.645
Okay, but you're gonna want to hang up,
because you have to see this.

02:15.679 --> 02:16.813
Seriously, if it's another one of your

02:16.847 --> 02:18.414
must-see Vimeo stars, I can't even.

02:18.449 --> 02:19.916
No, it's not. It's one of our clients.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.885
And, um, she won't stop
tweeting, and she sounds insane.

02:23.954 --> 02:25.421
Please tell me it's not Stacey North.

02:25.456 --> 02:26.656
Come on.

02:26.690 --> 02:29.892
"He's a demon in disguise. I'm gonna burn
him alive, destroy him and his wife."

02:29.927 --> 02:31.227
- Who's she talking about?
- I'm not sure.

02:31.261 --> 02:32.962
Apparently, it's some married A-lister,

02:32.996 --> 02:34.230
and that's why it's going viral.

02:34.264 --> 02:36.099
No, she sounds like a crazy person!

02:36.133 --> 02:37.934
And not in an amusing Kanye sort of way.

02:37.968 --> 02:39.435
Where the hell's her dad/manager?

02:39.470 --> 02:40.403
Not sure. Tried calling.

02:40.437 --> 02:42.271
He's not answering,
and neither is Stacey.

02:42.306 --> 02:43.306
Okay, well...

02:43.340 --> 02:44.907
I mean, you're in charge
of the social media crap.

02:44.942 --> 02:46.876
Can't you figure out a way to shut
down her account or something?

02:46.910 --> 02:49.245
We need to stop this, or it's
gonna destroy her career.

02:49.279 --> 02:50.747
- Okay.
- And mine.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.450
I just... I can't relax.

02:54.485 --> 02:56.586
- [Camera shutter clicking]
- It's not a natural... I don't...

02:56.620 --> 02:58.755
You know, if you want to get
into the headshot business,

02:58.789 --> 03:00.523
maybe you should hire
a real actor, you know?

03:00.557 --> 03:02.325
Or a model! Hire a model.

03:02.359 --> 03:04.360
[Giggles] You're just as handsome.

03:04.394 --> 03:05.228
Besides, I think it's finally time

03:05.262 --> 03:06.963
that you updated your website photo.

03:06.997 --> 03:07.997
I look adorable in that photo.

03:08.031 --> 03:09.832
You look like an intern
from "Grey's Anatomy."

03:09.867 --> 03:11.000
Mm.

03:11.034 --> 03:12.335
Mmm.

03:18.046 --> 03:19.275
Who's that?

03:19.309 --> 03:22.545
Oh, just... Just Harry.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.213
So, you hungry?

03:24.248 --> 03:26.349
I packed us an amazing cheese platter.

03:26.383 --> 03:28.284
Hold on there, Missy.
Why are you acting all weird?

03:28.318 --> 03:29.652
And why didn't you answer that?

03:29.686 --> 03:31.788
I thought you said Harry was okay

03:31.822 --> 03:33.189
with this whole thing... You and me.

03:33.223 --> 03:34.223
- He is.
- Yeah?

03:34.258 --> 03:35.291
He is.

03:36.527 --> 03:37.693
Mmm.

03:37.728 --> 03:40.396
Okay, so, you know what?
This is starting to feel a little bit

03:40.430 --> 03:42.331
like a diversionary tactic, you know?

03:42.366 --> 03:45.568
If he and Joss aren't okay
with us, then we kind of...

03:45.602 --> 03:49.438
Well... I don't actually know how
they feel. I haven't told them.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.050
- I tried to. I swear.
- What exactly are you waiting for?

03:53.070 --> 03:55.171
It's all kinds of tense
in that house right now.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.073
They were about to get married
in Vegas, and then they didn't,

03:57.108 --> 03:59.175
and who knows what the story is.

04:01.212 --> 04:02.412
Wow.

04:02.446 --> 04:04.247
- Really?
- I know.

04:04.281 --> 04:06.216
It can't be good, right?

04:06.250 --> 04:08.518
I just want the dust
to settle, and then,

04:08.552 --> 04:12.088
I promise... I will tell.

04:12.123 --> 04:13.657
Really?

04:13.691 --> 04:15.425
Yes.

04:15.459 --> 04:17.160
I'm not letting you get away that easy.

04:17.194 --> 04:19.161
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

04:19.196 --> 04:21.998
- Where's that cheese?
- Mm!

[Door opens]

[Sighs]

04:31.275 --> 04:32.742
Hey. What are you doing here?

04:32.777 --> 04:34.110
I had to get away from the office.

04:34.145 --> 04:36.179
Phones are ringing.
A client went off the rails.

04:36.213 --> 04:37.747
It's not been a good morning, Harry.

04:37.782 --> 04:39.349
Wow. Sorry.

04:39.383 --> 04:41.251
I mean, if I had known that Stacey North

04:41.285 --> 04:43.219
was gonna torpedo her whole career,

04:43.254 --> 04:45.422
I really wouldn't have worked
this hard to get her.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.756
You know, sometimes
it feels like this job

04:46.791 --> 04:49.259
is more like babysitting
than actual work.

04:49.293 --> 04:51.895
Well, why don't you just...
I don't know... let her go?

04:51.929 --> 04:53.396
Hey, can you pass me
that cloth behind you?

04:53.431 --> 04:54.764
Um, yeah.

04:54.799 --> 04:56.566
I... I can't just let her go.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.269
I was rebuilding my entire
client list around her.

04:59.303 --> 05:00.870
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

05:00.905 --> 05:03.273
Not really my, um, specialty.

05:03.307 --> 05:06.109
- How can I help?
- Um, I don't think you really can.

05:06.782 --> 05:10.583
Besides, you seem real busy shining
that toy from Jonathan, so...

05:10.603 --> 05:12.215
[Laughs]

05:12.249 --> 05:13.904
Yeah. Sorry.

05:13.924 --> 05:15.658
Uh, while we're on the
topic of Jonathan,

05:15.693 --> 05:18.094
he's having a benefit tomorrow
night for the L.A. Philharmonic,

05:18.128 --> 05:20.697
and he asked me to attend. Um...

05:20.731 --> 05:24.067
Obviously, I wouldn't ask you
to come along with me, but...

05:24.101 --> 05:26.569
- just wanted to let you know.
- Yeah. Okay. I appreciate it.

05:26.604 --> 05:27.904
And you're right.
I wouldn't have wanted to go.

05:27.938 --> 05:29.172
I-I do have to go.

05:29.206 --> 05:32.242
I'm... already in hot water.

05:32.276 --> 05:35.645
You don't... have to work with him.

05:37.147 --> 05:40.250
Joss, this will be
my third try at a restaurant.

05:40.284 --> 05:43.553
If this fails, that's it.
I won't get another shot.

05:43.587 --> 05:45.577
Jonathan's my best chance.
And you know what?

05:45.597 --> 05:48.597
I like working with him.
We have the same vision.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.463
[Cellphone chiming, buzzing repeatedly]

05:53.497 --> 05:55.798
Yep. Yep. Yep. Here it comes again.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.667
Make it stop!

06:01.405 --> 06:02.405
It's a clean break.

06:02.439 --> 06:04.574
So I agree with
your previous doctor's opinion.

06:04.608 --> 06:05.575
You won't need surgery.

06:05.609 --> 06:06.609
See?

06:06.644 --> 06:08.711
So, how long before
she can use her arm again?

06:08.746 --> 06:12.615
Actually, there's something more
pressing we need to discuss.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.117
Oh.

06:14.151 --> 06:17.987
Marjorie, have you been
feeling weak lately?

06:18.022 --> 06:19.622
- A little.
- Has anybody talked to you

06:19.657 --> 06:22.592
about your test results from the E.R.?

06:22.626 --> 06:25.762
It appears you have
late-stage cirrhosis.

06:27.498 --> 06:29.465
There must be some confusion.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.668
I'm just feeling a little tired.

06:31.702 --> 06:33.636
Still, I'd love to run
some additional tests,

06:33.671 --> 06:37.006
maybe a biopsy to confirm
exactly what stage you're at.

06:37.041 --> 06:39.142
But this is manageable, right?

06:39.176 --> 06:40.043
You can fix it, can't you?

06:40.077 --> 06:42.812
Well, we can give her
medication to help,

06:42.846 --> 06:46.082
but ultimately, you'll probably
need a liver transplant.

06:47.086 --> 06:49.285
- Oh, my God.
- How did this even happen?

06:49.320 --> 06:50.820
Well, the major cause of this disease

06:50.854 --> 06:53.261
is excessive alcohol consumption.

06:53.857 --> 06:57.493
So, Marjorie, how much would
you say you normally drink?

06:58.862 --> 07:00.597
Once or twice a week, perhaps.

07:00.631 --> 07:02.765
Mom. Please. Tell the truth.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.167
Would you please not?

07:04.201 --> 07:07.937
It's just that, in order to become
eligible for a liver donation,

07:07.972 --> 07:10.840
you'd have to refrain
from drugs, alcohol...

07:10.874 --> 07:13.109
Anything else that could make
the condition worse.

07:13.143 --> 07:14.978
Is that gonna be a problem?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.014
No.

07:18.048 --> 07:19.849
Not at all.

07:27.586 --> 07:29.488
I mean, what if she can't do it?

07:29.508 --> 07:31.889
What if it's the beginning of the end?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.876
You can't think that way, honey.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.679
Liver transplants are very common.

07:36.713 --> 07:38.314
This must seem so crazy.

07:38.348 --> 07:41.784
I'm usually complaining about
my mom, not worrying about her.

07:41.818 --> 07:44.387
Maybe this is just
the wakeup call she needs.

07:44.421 --> 07:47.156
I hope you're right, but I doubt it.

07:47.190 --> 07:48.558
Ugh! This is all too depressing.

07:48.592 --> 07:50.893
Give me some good news or something.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.129
My nanny's trying to poison Vivian.

07:53.163 --> 07:54.163
What?!

07:54.197 --> 07:55.364
I said "good news."

07:55.399 --> 07:57.133
Okay, I'm exaggerating.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.737
She fed her expired carrots.

07:58.757 --> 08:01.237
You know companies just
make up those dates, right?

08:01.271 --> 08:03.072
It's a scam to get you to keep buying.

08:03.106 --> 08:04.674
Look, it's a small thing. I get it.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.409
But I'm leaving my baby with her.

08:06.443 --> 08:08.411
Karen, it's baby food. Seriously.

08:08.445 --> 08:11.714
Well, she also decided
to feed Vivian solid food

08:11.748 --> 08:13.883
for the first time without asking me.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.318
I wanted to be the one to do that.

08:15.352 --> 08:17.144
You have to stick with
a nanny eventually.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.854
I know.

08:19.876 --> 08:23.225
Hey. Maybe you can come over
and see what you think of her.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.327
What am I gonna do?

08:24.361 --> 08:28.265
Just observe and give me
your opinion, as a fellow mom.

08:28.285 --> 08:29.752
I'm sure Lydia's fine,

08:29.787 --> 08:32.755
but it'll help me to know
if I'm crazy or not.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.991
Well, we both know the
answer to that one.

08:36.635 --> 08:37.659
Well, at least they caught the cirrhosis

08:37.693 --> 08:39.662
while there's still something
they can do about it.

08:39.696 --> 08:42.063
Yeah. It's actually a good
thing she got in that accident.

08:42.099 --> 08:43.065
Plus, she's warming up to me.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.903
- Really?
- Yeah, not so much.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.224
[Laughs] Yeah, in-laws can be tough.

08:47.259 --> 08:50.594
Joss' mum is not a fan of mine,
as you can imagine.

08:51.361 --> 08:55.066
In fact, Joss is the only
in-law I ever really got along with.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.001
Right, well, I don't plan
on sleeping with Marjorie

08:57.035 --> 08:58.569
- any time soon, so...
- [Laughs]

08:58.603 --> 09:00.938
Hilarious and a little disturbing.

09:00.972 --> 09:02.673
Oh, hey! Do you have plans
tomorrow night?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.675
- April gave me the night off.
- Yeah, actually.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.477
I have to go to this,
uh, black-tie benefit

09:06.511 --> 09:07.845
that Jonathan's hosting.

09:07.879 --> 09:10.448
- You want to come with?
- Ooh! Do I have to wear a tux?

09:10.482 --> 09:11.649
- Yeah.
- Then no.

09:11.683 --> 09:12.783
[Laughs]

09:12.818 --> 09:14.452
So, I assume this means
that Joss isn't going with you?

09:14.486 --> 09:15.853
Uh, no.

09:15.887 --> 09:19.357
I don't think Jonathan and she
will be hanging out any time soon.

09:19.391 --> 09:23.094
[Sighs] Man, I feel like I'm walking
on eggshells with both of them.

09:23.128 --> 09:26.163
Well, there might come a time when
you're gonna have to choose a side.

09:26.198 --> 09:29.500
Well, why should I have to do that?
I mean, that does not seem fair.

09:29.534 --> 09:30.868
It's not fair.

09:30.902 --> 09:32.336
But life's not fair.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.109
Hey, Stacey.

09:39.311 --> 09:42.146
- Is there anything you need?
- Uh, no, thank you, Kylie.

09:42.180 --> 09:45.015
Oh. [Sighs] You do not look good.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.684
Are you sure you don't want
some coffee or something?

09:46.718 --> 09:50.621
No, I want these billion Twitter
notifications per second to stop.

09:50.655 --> 09:52.890
Yeah, well, the world just watched you

09:52.924 --> 09:55.226
have a meltdown
140 characters at a time.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.128
It's not a meltdown! It's the truth!

09:57.162 --> 09:58.896
- Okay.
- People need to know.

09:58.930 --> 10:02.032
Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm...
I'm not sure they do need to know.

10:02.067 --> 10:05.169
And honestly, you're making
yourself look a little crazy,

10:05.203 --> 10:07.004
and you're talking openly
about having an affair.

10:07.038 --> 10:08.239
It's causing problems.

10:08.273 --> 10:09.707
What do you mean? What kind of problems?

10:09.741 --> 10:13.144
Well, um, I got a call from your
perfume line 20 minutes ago,

10:13.178 --> 10:15.513
and they're putting all press on hold.

10:15.547 --> 10:17.848
Yeah, you can't really be
the face of Purity

10:17.883 --> 10:19.817
and a public mistress at the same time.

10:19.851 --> 10:21.085
Oh, my God. My dad's gonna kill me.

10:21.119 --> 10:22.520
He worked on that deal for months.

10:22.554 --> 10:25.189
But this is... this is why I'm trying
to tell you... Here. Sit down.

10:25.223 --> 10:26.524
- [Sighs]
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.558 --> 10:29.026
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Okay. I'm done.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.061
I'll deactivate my Twitter.

10:31.096 --> 10:32.129
Good.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.869
Um, what...

10:35.889 --> 10:37.935
It's fine. It's prescription.
It's for my nerves.

10:37.969 --> 10:39.996
Seriously? No. That is
only gonna mess with your head.

10:40.016 --> 10:41.421
Hand it over.

10:41.929 --> 10:43.607
- Let's go.
- [Sighs]

10:43.642 --> 10:45.075
- Come on.
- Fine.

10:45.110 --> 10:46.744
Promise you, it's for
your own good. Now, listen.

10:46.778 --> 10:49.847
You need to get some rest
and lay low and let me fix this.

10:49.881 --> 10:51.248
[Voice breaking] Okay.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.417
Thank you, Joss. You're the best.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.952
Oh!

10:54.986 --> 10:57.694
I guess you're almost worth the money.

10:59.216 --> 11:00.570
[Cymbal crashes] Ohh!

11:00.590 --> 11:02.126
Shh! You're gonna wake up my mother!

11:02.160 --> 11:03.861
I'm sorry!

11:03.895 --> 11:05.696
This room wasn't exactly
built for a bed.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.866
- [Sighs]
- Anyway, how is she?

11:08.900 --> 11:11.535
[Sighs] I can't tell.

11:11.570 --> 11:15.239
She hasn't really said a word
about anything since the doctor.

11:15.273 --> 11:16.996
She's probably depressed.

11:17.016 --> 11:18.717
She's never gonna stop
drinking on her own.

11:18.751 --> 11:23.388
- Oh, you don't know that.
- She won't even admit she has a problem.

11:23.423 --> 11:27.159
And if she keeps drinking...
she could die.

11:27.193 --> 11:28.960
That's not gonna happen.

11:31.531 --> 11:33.231
Look, it might take a little while

11:33.266 --> 11:36.001
for it to sink in for her, but it will.

11:36.035 --> 11:37.502
I'm not getting my hopes up.

11:37.537 --> 11:40.939
People really can change, April.

11:40.973 --> 11:43.131
Even the ones you least expect.

[Pop, air hissing]

12:10.036 --> 12:11.347
Are you ready? Tell me.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.105
Does this poster entice you
to buy an album?

12:13.139 --> 12:15.941
Uh, yeah... If I was 13.

12:15.975 --> 12:16.975
- Sure.
- Okay.

12:17.009 --> 12:20.679
So, remember that guy
I was sort of... seeing?

12:20.713 --> 12:22.047
- Taco guy.
- Yeah.

12:22.081 --> 12:23.048
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:23.082 --> 12:25.484
- That's... That's the one.
- I've been meaning to ask you about him,

12:25.518 --> 12:27.119
but I didn't want to be pushy, you know?

12:27.153 --> 12:28.653
Which is hard,
because I love being pushy.

12:28.688 --> 12:29.654
[Both laugh]

12:29.689 --> 12:31.456
How's it going?

12:31.491 --> 12:34.559
I... I think there could be
something real there.

12:34.594 --> 12:35.694
Nice! Yeah?

12:35.728 --> 12:36.762
How's the sex?

12:37.730 --> 12:39.898
Oh. Sorry. See what I mean? Pushy.

12:39.932 --> 12:40.766
I-It's great.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.236
It's... It's... It's... It's just...

12:44.270 --> 12:46.872

- [Cellphone chimes]
- I-I'm... I'm so...

12:50.076 --> 12:51.676
Oh. Oh. Oh. Um, oh, wait, sorry.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.382
Can you just pause
on that thought for one second?

12:53.402 --> 12:54.379
I swear I want to hear everything,

12:54.414 --> 12:57.048
but I really need to check on something.

- Put those phones down!

What? Oh, my God!

13:05.725 --> 13:07.626
- What are you doing?!
- [Gasps deeply]

13:07.660 --> 13:09.861
- Is that Stacey North?
- Yep. That's her.

13:09.896 --> 13:12.230
Oh, why is she licking the
bagels and putting them back?

13:12.265 --> 13:14.032
I don't know. I wish
that there was some answer

13:14.066 --> 13:16.234
that I could give you to that
question that made sense.

13:16.269 --> 13:18.270
Well, don't they say
that all press is good press?

13:18.304 --> 13:19.438
Yeah. Do they really?

13:19.472 --> 13:21.006
H-Have they ever had a client

13:21.040 --> 13:22.240
self-destruct on the Internet before?

13:22.275 --> 13:23.375
- No.
- Don't judge me!

13:23.409 --> 13:24.910
I'm better than all of you!

13:24.944 --> 13:27.512
Oh! Make it stop.
Please make it stop. Please.

13:27.547 --> 13:29.614
Thank you.

13:29.649 --> 13:31.350
Okay. Okay.

13:34.920 --> 13:35.890
Yeah?

And...

13:37.900 --> 13:39.000
What's all this?

13:39.034 --> 13:40.067
I made breakfast.

13:40.102 --> 13:41.836
Mmm, mmm. This looks great.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.905

Well, come on. Sit, sit!

13:53.551 --> 13:55.719
Last night, when I was sleeping

13:55.753 --> 13:58.388
on that incredibly
uncomfortable mattress,

13:58.422 --> 14:00.623
I was blessed with some clarity.

14:00.658 --> 14:03.326
It's time for me to start
taking care of myself...

14:03.361 --> 14:06.730
Eating healthy, exercising more.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.732
[Singsong voice] Not to mention...

14:08.766 --> 14:10.834
spending more time with my girls.

14:10.868 --> 14:11.768
Wait... does that mean you'll be here

14:11.802 --> 14:13.136
to help me practice for my next debate?

14:13.170 --> 14:14.371
Of course!

14:14.405 --> 14:17.407
So, does this mean we all have
to eat like you? Because...

14:17.441 --> 14:19.376
I am just so glad that you're focusing

14:19.410 --> 14:21.144
on the positives, Marjorie.

14:21.178 --> 14:23.346
- That's the attitude.
- Well, thank you.

14:23.381 --> 14:25.648
Because I will beat this.

14:25.683 --> 14:27.584
And if I don't get to have

14:27.618 --> 14:30.687
an occasional glass
of champagne, so be it.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.456
Joss: Tell me what happened exactly.

14:33.491 --> 14:36.259
My dad freaked out on me about
hooking up with a married man

14:36.293 --> 14:37.727
and the perfume thing,

14:37.762 --> 14:40.230
and I had to get out
of the house before I exploded.

14:40.264 --> 14:41.364
That didn't work out so well.

14:41.399 --> 14:43.666
Okay, um, here's what we're gonna do.

14:43.701 --> 14:46.202
Okay, we're gonna remind
your fans why they love you

14:46.237 --> 14:47.771
and show them that you're not, you know,

14:47.805 --> 14:49.272
losing your mind,
that you care about people,

14:49.306 --> 14:50.673
and that you're not a homewrecker.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.776
What, like a press-release apology?

14:52.810 --> 14:54.043
Great. Write one up.

14:54.078 --> 14:55.211
It's already written, but you're
gonna need to do more than that,

14:55.246 --> 14:57.680
so you're volunteering
at the L.A. Food Bank tomorrow.

14:57.715 --> 14:58.615
Be there at 11:00.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.517
Wait... the food bank? Why?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.452
Uh, so that people can see
that you're not a spoiled brat

15:02.486 --> 15:04.888
who goes around licking
perfectly good food every day?

15:04.922 --> 15:06.356
Plus, anyone who brings a canned good

15:06.390 --> 15:08.391
will get a free download
of your single, so...

15:08.426 --> 15:09.726
That's kind of genius.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.394
I know! So don't screw it up.

15:11.429 --> 15:14.130
I'm getting as much press there
as I possibly can.

15:27.445 --> 15:29.479
[Gasps] Without asking you first?

15:29.513 --> 15:31.881
You're right. You should fire her.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.550
Look at this, though.

15:36.153 --> 15:38.988
Well, she straightened
those up, as well.

the real picture here.

It's not that. I just have
a weird feeling about her.

Well, that's because
you don't even know her.

16:19.015 --> 16:21.583
Maybe if you talked to
Lydia a little more,

16:21.617 --> 16:23.051
you'd feel better?

Mm. Maybe.

[Giggles]

16:59.055 --> 17:01.690
- Is the benefit over?
- Oh, no, it's just getting started.

17:01.724 --> 17:03.692
- I just have another engagement.
- Ah.

17:03.726 --> 17:04.792
I'm Kristen, by the way.

17:04.827 --> 17:08.463
Yes, I know who you are.
Obviously, I'm a huge fan.

17:08.497 --> 17:09.698
I, um...

17:09.732 --> 17:11.333
I loved "The Minutes of Our Hours."

17:11.367 --> 17:13.167
That movie made me cry,
which I don't normally

17:13.202 --> 17:15.337
- like to do in public.
- [Laughs]

17:15.371 --> 17:18.540
Well, that's very sweet
of you. Thank you.

17:18.574 --> 17:21.432
I'm actually a huge fan of yours.

17:22.311 --> 17:24.646
- No, you're not.
- Your show's amazing, you know.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.082
- I've watched every episode.
- Wow.

17:28.718 --> 17:31.086
I'm really glad I caught you
on my way out.

17:32.488 --> 17:33.688
Oh. This is me.

17:33.723 --> 17:35.357
Um, hey...

17:35.391 --> 17:38.626
what cuisine are you serving
at your next restaurant?

17:38.661 --> 17:40.362
Everyone's being
really hush-hush about it.

17:40.396 --> 17:41.329
I'm dying to know.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.832
Well, you'll just have to
come and find out.

17:43.866 --> 17:46.234
How about a private
cooking class in the meantime,

17:46.268 --> 17:47.502
for me and some friends?

17:47.536 --> 17:49.304
- Oh.
- They'll totally flip.

17:49.338 --> 17:51.573
Yeah, I don't really do
that kind of thing anymore.

17:51.607 --> 17:52.974
Oh, please?

17:53.008 --> 17:54.376
Uh...

17:54.410 --> 17:57.078
I'll pay you, obviously.

17:57.113 --> 17:58.747
How's 15 sound?

17:58.781 --> 18:00.882
- 15...
- Yeah... $15,000.

18:03.085 --> 18:04.452
Yeah, that works.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.725
You know what? I think I can go
back in for a little longer.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.395
I have some questions
that I want to ask you.

18:13.429 --> 18:16.865
Hello! Anybody hungry?

18:16.899 --> 18:20.735
I got Pine and Crane...
Extra pea shoots for Marjorie.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.270
[Crash] Marjorie: Ohh!

18:25.541 --> 18:27.075
Oh, no. What happened? What happened?

18:27.109 --> 18:28.510
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

18:28.544 --> 18:30.879
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No. No! Shh!

18:30.913 --> 18:33.581
I-I... I just slipped.

18:33.616 --> 18:35.216
- I'm fine.
- You're drunk.

18:35.251 --> 18:36.518
No.

18:36.552 --> 18:39.754
I just had one drink for the pain.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.724
- Come on. Let me help you up.
- Okay.

18:42.758 --> 18:43.892
[Grunting] Come on.

18:43.926 --> 18:45.026
Come on. Easy.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.661
[Groans]

18:49.799 --> 18:52.801
You understand, right?

18:52.835 --> 18:55.003
I mean, you fell off before.

18:56.138 --> 18:57.539
Okay.

18:57.573 --> 19:02.210
- I think it's time for bed, Marjorie.
- It's not that easy, you know.

19:02.244 --> 19:05.680
Not knowing how long you have
but knowing it's not a lot.

19:07.822 --> 19:09.317
Let's see how you deal with it

19:09.351 --> 19:11.085
if somebody tells you you're dying.

19:20.968 --> 19:22.243
Baby!

19:23.827 --> 19:26.158
Aha. You're up.

19:26.192 --> 19:27.292
I was hoping you would be.

19:27.327 --> 19:28.527
Yeah. Just working.

19:28.561 --> 19:31.296
I'm trying to spin Stacey's
Bagelgate into something good.

19:31.331 --> 19:34.099
"Bagelgate"? I'm not familiar
with that album.

19:34.133 --> 19:37.135
However, how about you don't work?

19:38.247 --> 19:39.404
Whoa!

19:39.439 --> 19:40.772
Wow. You really smell like tequila.

19:40.807 --> 19:42.508
Um, how did you get home?

19:42.542 --> 19:44.009
You didn't ride
that donor cycle, did you?

19:44.043 --> 19:46.411
No, no. I called an Uber.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.800
Probably shouldn't have
taken that last shot,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.554
but who can say no to Dudamel, huh?

19:50.588 --> 19:52.689
[Giggles] Obviously not you.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.491
Hey, guess who I met tonight.

19:54.525 --> 19:57.194
- I...
- Kristen Sorbonne.

19:57.228 --> 19:58.262
Really?

19:58.296 --> 20:00.417
Yes, and she wants to hire me
for a cooking class,

20:00.437 --> 20:02.905
which, I know... it sounds
like step down, but...

20:02.939 --> 20:04.406
[Whistles] she offered me a lot of cash.

20:04.441 --> 20:05.674
Cool.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.476
Yeah, my... my night
was really great, too.

20:07.511 --> 20:09.144
I, uh, I hung out with Andy Cohen

20:09.179 --> 20:10.946
on the couch in my PJs.

20:10.981 --> 20:12.348
Ate some cold leftovers.

20:12.382 --> 20:13.816
B-Babe, I'm just trying to share...

20:13.850 --> 20:16.318
Look, you don't have to, okay?

20:16.353 --> 20:18.229
Harry, I'm glad that you
had a good time. I am.

20:18.249 --> 20:19.688
But maybe you should
just think of your work and me

20:19.723 --> 20:21.423
like church and state.

20:22.392 --> 20:23.425
[Sighs]

20:25.395 --> 20:27.363
So I guess that means you don't want

20:27.397 --> 20:30.432
the extra swag bag I stole?

20:30.452 --> 20:32.484
Yeah, no, thanks. I'm good.

20:39.075 --> 20:41.243
Do you need anything special?

20:42.646 --> 20:43.846
You know what?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.048
Vivian and I can go to the market later.

20:46.082 --> 20:49.341
- Are you sure?
- Yes, definitely. You should stay.

20:49.361 --> 20:52.723
I was hoping we could get to
know each other a little better.

20:52.743 --> 20:54.265
Why don't we have lunch?

20:54.524 --> 20:55.391
Really, I mean it.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.459
I don't need to get to work for an hour.

20:57.494 --> 20:59.361
Come on.

20:59.396 --> 21:02.464
You lived in 10 countries
before you were 21?

21:02.499 --> 21:05.067
- Army brat right here.
- Huh!

21:05.101 --> 21:07.536
That must have been exciting.

21:07.571 --> 21:10.506
Eh, it's more like same base,
different country,

21:10.540 --> 21:12.641
kind of hard to make
friends all the time.

21:12.676 --> 21:14.677
Oh, I can imagine.

21:14.711 --> 21:16.845
I think that's why I get along
better with babies and kids.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.348
They're easier to talk to.

21:19.382 --> 21:22.151
I mean, I haven't had a date in...

21:22.185 --> 21:24.353
I can't even remember.

21:24.387 --> 21:28.490
- Come on. I don't believe that.
- Yeah, it's been like... three years?

21:28.525 --> 21:31.060
Have you tried dating online?

21:31.094 --> 21:32.494
Maybe it's a good baby step.

21:32.529 --> 21:34.763
Um, once, but it was kind of a disaster.

21:34.798 --> 21:36.398
Oh. Disaster how?

21:36.433 --> 21:38.067
I didn't really know
what to write in the profile,

21:38.101 --> 21:40.569
and I hate all the pictures of myself,

21:40.604 --> 21:43.439
so I just got a bunch
of Nigerian princes

21:43.473 --> 21:45.341
asking for money.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.375
I don't think you should give up.

21:46.409 --> 21:49.811
You're so brave.
I could never do what you do.

21:50.146 --> 21:53.382
- I... I read your book.
- Oh. I see.

21:53.416 --> 21:55.384
[Vivian crying]

21:55.418 --> 21:57.419
Oh, poor baby. I wonder why she's awake.

21:57.454 --> 21:59.622
- I can get her.
- No, it's okay. You go to work.

21:59.656 --> 22:01.323
Thanks.

22:04.494 --> 22:07.596
It's not a bad place you've got here.

22:07.631 --> 22:09.198
It used to belong to Grace Kelly.

22:09.232 --> 22:10.099
Wow.

22:10.133 --> 22:12.434
I'm a sucker for those kind of things.

22:12.469 --> 22:13.769
Can I get you a drink?

22:13.803 --> 22:16.605
Uh, ye... no, thanks.
On the clock and all.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.208
Are those... white strawberries?

22:19.242 --> 22:21.043
Oh, yeah. You know what?
You have to smell them.

22:21.077 --> 22:24.213
They're from this incredible
urban growhouse in Silver Lake.

22:24.247 --> 22:25.648
[Sniffs]

22:25.682 --> 22:27.716
Mmm.

22:27.751 --> 22:29.952
Delicious!

22:31.488 --> 22:33.922
Yeah. Uh, my fiancée loves them.

22:33.957 --> 22:35.991
- She's, um...
- [Laughs]

22:36.026 --> 22:37.626
Subtle.

22:37.661 --> 22:39.895
I hope you don't think
this is, like, a hired date.

22:39.929 --> 22:40.829
Pfft! No.

22:40.864 --> 22:42.931
My friends really are stuck in traffic.

22:42.966 --> 22:44.233
Y-Yeah. N-N-No.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.001
My fiancée, Joss, really does love them.

22:46.036 --> 22:48.971
I just thought you should know
because, uh, she's...

22:49.539 --> 22:51.273
I'm making this worse, aren't I?

22:51.307 --> 22:53.242
Yes. [Giggles]

22:53.276 --> 22:55.974
Actually, I'm dating Jesse Darby.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.013
The singer?

22:58.048 --> 22:59.481
Oh. Right. Yes.

22:59.516 --> 23:01.583
I should read People
magazine more often.

23:01.618 --> 23:02.518
[Laughs]

23:02.552 --> 23:05.020
[Sighs]

23:05.055 --> 23:07.523
This has been the craziest ride.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.625
Do you know that five years ago,

23:09.659 --> 23:11.627
I was throwing a fiesta in my apartment

23:11.661 --> 23:14.363
to celebrate landing
a Taco Bell commercial?

23:14.397 --> 23:16.598
And now I'm literally turning down

23:16.633 --> 23:18.500
multi-million-dollar jobs.

23:18.535 --> 23:19.802
It's ridiculous.

23:19.836 --> 23:22.137
Yeah. That must be really tough.

23:22.172 --> 23:24.606
I'm only telling you this
to prepare you.

23:24.641 --> 23:27.276
Prepare me for what?

23:27.310 --> 23:29.772
For what's about to happen to you.

23:30.847 --> 23:33.282
I've been seeing your name everywhere.

23:33.316 --> 23:34.149
Ah.

23:34.184 --> 23:35.951
I-Is this the part where you tell me

23:35.985 --> 23:37.953
that it's not as great as it seems?

23:37.987 --> 23:38.954
Yes.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.789
Because it's even better.

23:41.991 --> 23:44.526
Can I give you some unsolicited advice?

23:44.561 --> 23:46.295
Yeah. Advise away.

23:46.329 --> 23:49.398
When it's your turn,
just be sure to enjoy the ride.

23:49.432 --> 23:51.233
There are gonna be people out there

23:51.267 --> 23:53.402
who may want to make you
feel bad for it,

23:53.436 --> 23:55.237
but don't let them.

23:55.271 --> 23:56.638
You'll regret it.

24:00.910 --> 24:02.911
You can do this.

24:02.946 --> 24:03.746
[Sighs]

24:03.780 --> 24:06.648
Just remember... It's for the best.

24:06.683 --> 24:08.650
She needs help, April.

24:08.685 --> 24:10.052
She's not gonna like this.

24:10.086 --> 24:11.487
It'd be weird if she did.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.554
[Sighs]

24:14.124 --> 24:17.326
[Indistinct talking on TV]

24:17.360 --> 24:19.027
Do you mind turning the TV down, Mom?

24:22.532 --> 24:23.823
[TV shuts off]

24:24.553 --> 24:28.771
[Sighs] April, if this is about
last night, I'm just mortified.

24:28.805 --> 24:31.173
I know. We've been through this before.

24:31.207 --> 24:33.041
But things are different now.

24:35.779 --> 24:37.048
It's serious.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.584
And I don't want to lose you.

24:39.619 --> 24:41.753
I don't want to lose you, either.

24:41.787 --> 24:44.356
Good.

24:44.390 --> 24:49.327
Then I think we need to...
get you real help.

24:52.632 --> 24:55.934
- Rehab centers?
- We need to discuss options.

24:55.968 --> 24:57.702
April, I know

24:57.737 --> 25:01.072
that it must be really difficult
having me around

25:01.107 --> 25:03.241
after everything I've put you through...

25:03.275 --> 25:04.476
That's not what this is about.

25:04.510 --> 25:07.712
I see now, looking back,
that my drinking

25:07.747 --> 25:11.082
has been the root
of a lot of our problems.

25:11.117 --> 25:13.618
I've been in denial.

25:13.653 --> 25:16.087
I need to stop lying
to the people I love,

25:16.122 --> 25:19.591
and I need to stop drinking.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.059
[Voice breaking] Wow, Mom.

25:21.093 --> 25:22.727
No, I want to stop...

25:22.762 --> 25:26.831
If for nothing else, for you and Lucy.

25:26.866 --> 25:28.733
[Chuckles]

25:28.768 --> 25:31.508
[Sniffles] That's great.

25:31.528 --> 25:34.497
Then let's go through these places.

25:34.531 --> 25:36.565
We can do this.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.668
Exactly. We can.

25:39.703 --> 25:41.937
I know me, April.

25:41.972 --> 25:43.772
I need my family.

25:43.807 --> 25:48.244
And having Marc around,
I think I can lean on him.

25:48.278 --> 25:51.614
I just think that maybe you
need more, like a professional.

25:51.648 --> 25:55.451
[Voice breaking] No. I need you, April.

25:57.354 --> 26:00.456
Because if you send me away,
I'm not gonna make it.

26:00.490 --> 26:01.557
I know it.

26:03.159 --> 26:04.793
Okay.

26:04.828 --> 26:07.463
Okay. We'll do it together.

26:08.832 --> 26:11.155
No, it was all Stacey's idea.

26:11.175 --> 26:12.590
Well, she felt awful,

26:12.610 --> 26:14.243
and she wanted to give
something back, you know?

26:14.278 --> 26:16.245
I suggested a press release, but she...

26:16.280 --> 26:18.514
She came up with the idea.

26:18.549 --> 26:20.450
Yes, you can quote me.

26:20.484 --> 26:23.019
Bye-bye.

26:23.053 --> 26:24.354
[Sighs]

26:24.388 --> 26:25.588
Wow.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.161
It's a pretty impressive
operation you've built here.

26:34.998 --> 26:36.532
[Stammers]

26:36.567 --> 26:38.201
Uh, yeah, thank you.

26:38.235 --> 26:41.270
I, um... I've worked...
I've worked really hard and...

26:41.305 --> 26:43.439
Looks like it.

26:43.474 --> 26:44.707
How...

26:44.742 --> 26:46.709
[Chuckles]

26:47.125 --> 26:48.024
I'm sorry.

26:48.059 --> 26:49.693
I'm trying really hard
with the small talk,

26:49.713 --> 26:52.662
but I just... I can't seem
to find any words.

26:52.697 --> 26:54.664
What... What are you doing here, Scott?

26:54.699 --> 26:57.100
Right, um... There's really
no easy way to say this,

26:57.135 --> 26:58.702
so I'll just come right out and say it.

26:58.736 --> 27:00.771
Uh...

27:00.805 --> 27:02.372
I've been seeing Kate.

27:03.302 --> 27:05.609
Your Kate. Well, you, know,
Harry's Kate, actually.

27:05.643 --> 27:07.043
- What?!
- Yeah.

27:07.078 --> 27:09.068
No, I-I didn't know who
she was when we started.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.356
Um, actually, I met her at that, um...

27:11.390 --> 27:12.557
That food truck
that you turned me on to.

27:12.592 --> 27:13.491
- No, no, no.
- You know...

27:13.526 --> 27:15.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:15.061 --> 27:17.533
Are you telling me that you're Taco Guy?

27:17.553 --> 27:18.663
I mean, I don't even know
what that means.

27:18.698 --> 27:21.399
- Oh, my God.
- But, uh... there's more.

27:21.434 --> 27:23.068
Please tell me that you're
not engaged. Please?

27:23.102 --> 27:24.235
No.

27:25.638 --> 27:27.172
No, I ju... I just, um...

27:27.206 --> 27:29.977
It's just that I've come to realize...

27:31.077 --> 27:34.512
Kate's a substitute
for what I really want.

27:34.547 --> 27:37.582
If you're not happy with Harry,
you shouldn't be with him.

27:37.617 --> 27:39.493
I'm still in love with you, Joss.

27:46.048 --> 27:48.529
What the hell do you think you're doing?

27:48.549 --> 27:50.316
I know. I know. it's crazy, right?

27:50.351 --> 27:52.185
Yeah, you think? No, Scott, stop.

27:52.219 --> 27:53.253
Y-You're not still in love with me...

27:53.287 --> 27:56.122
Listen, I'm just as surprised
as you are, okay.

27:56.156 --> 27:57.891
But it makes sense, because, look,

27:57.925 --> 28:00.293
the night that Jen moved out,
that's the night I met Kate.

28:00.327 --> 28:01.861
Kate brought me back
to you. That's fate.

28:01.896 --> 28:03.312
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Sure it is.

28:03.332 --> 28:04.265
Stop. This is insane.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.301
You realize that I'm still
with Harry, right?

28:06.335 --> 28:07.679
I know, and I know
that you were supposed to

28:07.699 --> 28:09.758
marry him in Vegas, but you didn't.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.639
So?

28:11.674 --> 28:15.343
So that helped me realize
the truth about us.

28:15.378 --> 28:17.178
It wasn't me, Joss.

28:17.213 --> 28:18.413
You were afraid of commitment.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.316
And... And I... I saw a window...

28:21.350 --> 28:23.218
No, there's... There's no window, Scott.

28:23.252 --> 28:25.253
- I promise.
- There is a window.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.055
And I'll stay here, and I'll...

28:27.089 --> 28:28.328
I'll wait for you to see it, too.

28:28.348 --> 28:31.159
Because I know somewhere
deep down in there...

28:31.193 --> 28:33.460
there's a part of you
that knows this is right.

28:34.530 --> 28:37.232
I knew this was gonna be hard
for you to process. It's a lot.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.101
- Kate said...
- Kate?

28:40.136 --> 28:43.271
What, are you...
you using Kate for information?

28:43.305 --> 28:44.406
No.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.941
No, and I never wanted her to be in
the middle of any of this, okay?

28:46.976 --> 28:48.376
If you want, I can call her right now

28:48.411 --> 28:49.310
and I can tell her it's over.

28:49.345 --> 28:51.346
No, no, no.
Don't tell her anything, okay?

28:51.380 --> 28:53.181
You... Just don't even go near her.

28:53.215 --> 28:54.449
I will... I will talk to Kate.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.917
Okay, yeah, if that's what you want.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.452
Yes. That's what I want.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.455
I-I-I need you to leave her alone, okay?

29:00.489 --> 29:02.857
And... And while you're at it,

29:02.892 --> 29:05.226
I really need you
to leave me alone, too.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.473
So, I took your advice
and talked to Lydia,

29:18.507 --> 29:20.108
and I'm gonna keep her.

29:20.142 --> 29:22.210
She's just a lonely girl.

29:22.244 --> 29:24.412
And I did think about what you said.

29:24.447 --> 29:26.281
Maybe I was a little rash

29:26.315 --> 29:29.217
in firing some of my other nannies.

29:29.251 --> 29:31.453
But it wasn't because
of the reasons you said

29:31.487 --> 29:33.822
or the expired food or...

29:33.856 --> 29:36.057
[Sighs]

29:36.091 --> 29:38.226
What is it?

29:38.260 --> 29:40.495
Every time Vivian gets attached

29:40.529 --> 29:42.497
or makes a new memory with a nanny,

29:42.531 --> 29:44.899
it drives me crazy.

29:44.934 --> 29:47.135
I'm worried she'll...

29:47.169 --> 29:48.366
She'll what?

29:48.386 --> 29:50.305
She'll love them more than she loves me.

29:50.339 --> 29:52.307
There. I said it. [Chuckles]

29:52.341 --> 29:53.741
It's dumb. I know.

29:53.776 --> 29:56.411
That is so not dumb. It is normal.

29:56.445 --> 29:58.513
[Sighs]

29:58.547 --> 29:59.948
When I was a little girl,

29:59.982 --> 30:03.835
I loved going over to my aunt's house.

30:04.363 --> 30:06.855
We'd drink tea and tell stories

30:06.889 --> 30:10.325
and dress up in her jewelry.

30:10.359 --> 30:14.629
But my mother, she'd sit there alone,

30:14.663 --> 30:16.865
reading her books.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.333
I can count on one hand

30:18.367 --> 30:21.469
the number of times
she said she loved me.

30:23.539 --> 30:25.340
[Voice breaking] I don't want
to be that way with Vivian.

30:25.374 --> 30:29.143
I want her to feel loved and supported.

30:30.513 --> 30:34.282
And I worry that I'm
not capable of that.

30:34.316 --> 30:35.683
Of course you are.

30:35.718 --> 30:36.918
How do you know?

30:36.952 --> 30:40.054
Because you've been that way
for me whenever I've needed you.

30:40.089 --> 30:41.603
And I have seen you with Vivian.

30:41.623 --> 30:46.728
There is no way this little girl
doesn't know how loved she is.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.496
Come here.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.166
[Chuckles]

30:52.201 --> 30:53.268
I'm actually kind of busy.

30:53.302 --> 30:56.571
I just wanted to say thank you
for sticking by me.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.574
This food-bank thing is totally working.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.509
Stacey Feeds is trending,

31:01.544 --> 31:04.479
and my new single is
number 12 on iTunes.

31:04.513 --> 31:07.382
See? Sometimes things work out.

31:07.416 --> 31:10.885
Even my ex wrote me about how
cool it is I help the food bank.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.587
Wait. You're talking to him again?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.989
No, Stacey, you...
You really need to make

31:15.024 --> 31:16.324
a clean break from the past.

31:16.358 --> 31:17.759
I'll be fine.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.994
I mean, whatever happens,
at least this time

31:20.029 --> 31:21.529
I know to keep it private.

31:21.564 --> 31:22.564
Mm.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.900
You know what?

31:25.935 --> 31:27.602
This is a place that really helped me,

31:27.636 --> 31:29.270
and I think that it might help you, too

31:29.305 --> 31:32.440
Just in case any of that anger
comes back up, you know?

31:32.474 --> 31:34.876
It's called Impact.

31:34.910 --> 31:38.580
- A workout class?
- [Chuckles] It's way more than that.

31:38.614 --> 31:40.782
They were there for me
when I really needed strength.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.684
Just... Just give it a chance.

31:42.718 --> 31:44.619
You know, at the very least,
you'll burn 1,000 calories.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.254
Then I guess "Why not?"

31:48.657 --> 31:49.557
O...kay.

31:49.592 --> 31:52.360
Oh, B.T.dubs,
can I get those pills back?

31:52.394 --> 31:54.028
I have a friend that really needs them.

31:54.063 --> 31:55.697
Yeah, nice try. I already flushed them.

31:55.731 --> 31:57.565
[Sighs]

31:58.934 --> 32:00.735
Bye, babe.

32:00.769 --> 32:03.104
Bye.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.173
[Door opens]

32:13.782 --> 32:15.950
Kate. Uh, hey.

32:15.985 --> 32:18.586
Yeah, we should probably talk.

32:18.621 --> 32:21.055
[Humming, singing indistinctly]

32:24.384 --> 32:25.827
Hey, you.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.428
Hey.

32:27.463 --> 32:29.030
Look what I got.

32:30.666 --> 32:31.799
Oh, oh, oh.

32:31.834 --> 32:33.067
You know what they say...

32:33.102 --> 32:34.834
Fancy linens are the way
to a man's heart.

32:34.854 --> 32:37.271
I also got your favorite...

32:37.306 --> 32:38.840
Almond brittle and salted ganache.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.381
Oh! From Salt & Straw?

32:40.401 --> 32:42.469
[Chuckles]

32:42.503 --> 32:43.846
Wait a sec.

32:43.866 --> 32:45.817
Why do I feel like
you're buttering me up?

32:45.837 --> 32:47.619
I'm not.

32:47.639 --> 32:48.815
You're a terrible liar.

32:48.835 --> 32:50.277
Come on. Out with it. What is it?

32:50.311 --> 32:51.812
[Sighs]

32:53.715 --> 32:55.349
My mom and I had a long talk.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.652
- Mm.
- And, Marc, you should've heard her.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.654
She opened up to me.

33:00.688 --> 33:03.557
It's what I've been waiting
for all these years.

33:03.591 --> 33:04.936
That's great, April.

33:04.956 --> 33:08.528
I gave her the brochures,
we weighed the pros and cons,

33:08.563 --> 33:11.696
but, ultimately, we decided that...

33:11.881 --> 33:14.212
here is where she needs to be.

33:17.839 --> 33:19.639
You know she's just playing you, right?

33:19.674 --> 33:22.376
I know I may sound naive,
but I don't think she is.

33:22.410 --> 33:23.510
You weren't there.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.179
She really understands
the severity of the situation.

33:26.214 --> 33:28.106
It's an act, April.

33:28.126 --> 33:29.383
She got caught, so now she's the victim.

33:29.417 --> 33:31.218
No. No, she is ready for help.

33:31.252 --> 33:33.938
I know alcoholics and how
manipulative they can be.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.246
They'll do whatever it takes to survive.

33:35.266 --> 33:36.691
Well, what am I supposed to do?

33:36.711 --> 33:38.658
Turn my back on my mother
when she's begging me for help?

33:38.693 --> 33:40.394
Did you factor me
into this decision at all?

33:40.428 --> 33:41.828
What it means for my sobriety?

33:41.863 --> 33:43.864
Of course I did. We both did.

33:43.898 --> 33:45.399
She actually feels like
it would be helpful

33:45.433 --> 33:47.434
having you around as someone
who's gone through this.

33:47.468 --> 33:49.369
[Scoffs] So she is dragging
my sobriety into this.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.972
Isn't this what you wanted to go
to school for... To help people?

33:52.006 --> 33:54.841
I'm not qualified to help her just
because I registered for classes.

33:54.876 --> 33:57.826
You didn't even bother
talking to me about this.

33:58.312 --> 34:00.013
[Voice breaking] She's my mother.

34:00.047 --> 34:01.248
And she's sick.

34:01.282 --> 34:02.349
[Sighs]

34:02.383 --> 34:05.419
I need you to give it a chance.

34:07.722 --> 34:09.255
Fine.

34:09.290 --> 34:11.158
Fine, I will... For you.

34:12.493 --> 34:14.761
[Sighs] But I can promise you,
this will not end well.

34:32.714 --> 34:34.147
Hey.

34:37.513 --> 34:39.589
So...

34:40.121 --> 34:41.688
I know Scott's Taco Guy.

34:41.723 --> 34:43.524
- I figured.
- Yeah.

34:43.543 --> 34:44.844
I wanted to tell you
so many times, Joss,

34:44.878 --> 34:46.344
but there was just never a good moment,

34:46.380 --> 34:47.847
and... and Scott wanted to do it.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.282
No, I get it. It's...

34:49.315 --> 34:51.751
It's hard to tell someone that
you're seeing their ex-fiancé.

34:51.784 --> 34:52.819
It is.

34:52.853 --> 34:57.223
But I'm... I'm... I'm so happy
that it's you, Joss.

34:57.257 --> 34:59.225
I knew you'd be okay with it.

34:59.259 --> 35:00.910
Yeah. You know... [Sighs]

35:00.930 --> 35:02.929
Kate, I'm really glad that
you're back out there dating,

35:02.963 --> 35:04.564
and it seems to be making you happy,

35:04.598 --> 35:07.567
but are you... are you sure
he's the right guy?

35:07.601 --> 35:10.203
[Laughs] Of course he is.

35:10.237 --> 35:12.939
I said that I would stay here
in L.A. to find love,

35:12.973 --> 35:15.074
and... and I have.

35:15.108 --> 35:16.509
But you...

35:17.644 --> 35:19.672
You're not gonna be happy with Scott.

35:20.129 --> 35:21.447
Okay? It's not gonna last.

35:21.482 --> 35:22.548
You just have to trust me on this, Kate.

35:22.583 --> 35:23.950
How do you know it won't last?

35:23.984 --> 35:26.552
Because I know Scott.

35:26.587 --> 35:28.588
He's... He's capricious.
He's hot. He's cold.

35:28.622 --> 35:30.656
He's... still married to Jen.

35:30.691 --> 35:31.824
He's getting a divorce.

35:31.859 --> 35:33.226
Oh, okay. Great.

35:33.260 --> 35:34.827
So what does that make you,
then? The rebound?

35:34.862 --> 35:36.496
Mm.

35:36.530 --> 35:38.598
You don't know anything
about our relationship.

35:38.632 --> 35:42.301
Yeah, you're right. I don't. But it
doesn't really matter, Kate, because, uh,

35:42.336 --> 35:44.770
I already told Scott that
Harry and I aren't okay with it.

35:44.805 --> 35:46.072
So you can't see him anymore.

35:46.106 --> 35:47.673
You and Scott... Over.

35:47.708 --> 35:49.175
[Gasps] Seriously?

35:49.209 --> 35:51.477
- Yes.
- He cares about me, Joss.

35:51.512 --> 35:52.912
We only told you out of courtesy.

35:52.946 --> 35:54.413
It doesn't matter what you think.

35:54.448 --> 35:55.548
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:55.582 --> 35:58.484
Okay, well, why don't you
just try not calling him?

35:58.519 --> 36:00.086
- Let him call you.
- Okay. Sure.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.470
Because I can tell you right now
that that won't happen.

36:03.991 --> 36:05.324
I'm sorry, Kate.

36:05.359 --> 36:07.593
[Chuckling] Wow.

36:07.628 --> 36:12.298
Mm. I-I-I thought
Savi was the bitchy sister.

36:12.332 --> 36:14.500
I guess I was wrong.

36:14.535 --> 36:16.569
[Exhales slowly]

36:27.180 --> 36:28.614
[Grunts]

36:29.650 --> 36:31.651
[Knocks]

36:31.685 --> 36:33.119
Do you need any help getting settled?

36:33.153 --> 36:35.621
No, thank you. I'm almost done.

36:36.757 --> 36:40.326
For what it's worth, I know...

36:40.360 --> 36:41.894
how hard it is to get sober.

36:41.929 --> 36:43.529
I know you do.

36:43.564 --> 36:46.832
That's why I'm grateful to April

36:46.867 --> 36:48.768
for supporting me through this.

36:50.270 --> 36:51.203
Okay.

36:51.238 --> 36:55.007
Well, if you need anything,
uh, let me know.

36:55.042 --> 36:56.576
[Sighs]

36:56.610 --> 37:00.012
You know, I-I go to this
meeting in Santa Monica,

37:00.047 --> 37:01.681
and it's actually kind of fun.

37:01.715 --> 37:05.885
[Chuckles] As weird as it
is to categorize AA as fun.

37:06.879 --> 37:08.854
I don't think that kind
of thing is for me.

37:10.357 --> 37:13.025
Marjorie, I thought you were
serious about getting better.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.727
I am.

37:14.761 --> 37:17.494
But I don't need you to help me.

37:17.514 --> 37:18.981
Just like you don't help around here.

37:19.016 --> 37:20.416
Excuse me?

37:20.451 --> 37:22.185
You play in your little band

37:22.219 --> 37:25.588
and don't bother to contribute
financially at all?

37:25.622 --> 37:27.357
You're dragging my
daughter down with you.

37:27.391 --> 37:30.126
Okay, I thought we were
turning over a new leaf here.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.462
All that stuff you said to April
about me being here...

37:32.496 --> 37:33.996
Why should I trust you?

37:34.031 --> 37:35.798
Do you think I don't know
that you were the one

37:35.833 --> 37:37.500
that ratted me out
the last time I was here?

37:37.534 --> 37:38.534
Oh, please.

37:38.569 --> 37:40.603
Going through my trash,

37:40.637 --> 37:42.538
showing April the empty bottles.

37:42.573 --> 37:44.827
You're the reason
that we didn't talk for a year.

37:44.847 --> 37:47.944
- Don't blame that on me.
- Let me be clear.

37:47.978 --> 37:50.513
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be around,

37:50.547 --> 37:53.349
and I need to know that my girls
are gonna be taken care of

37:53.384 --> 37:54.417
when I'm gone,

37:54.451 --> 37:58.411
and that does not mean
leaving them in your hands.

38:01.816 --> 38:04.560
- [Door opens]
- You won't be around much longer.

38:05.115 --> 38:06.829
- Trust me.
- [Door closes]

38:06.864 --> 38:08.197
We won the debate! We won!

38:08.232 --> 38:11.200
[Gasps] We alway win.

38:11.235 --> 38:12.535
Don't we?

38:12.569 --> 38:14.804
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:14.838 --> 38:17.173
Just, uh, like two peas in a pod.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.976
- Hey!
- Okay, so, it was really easy at first,

38:20.010 --> 38:22.412

and then Hally came in second.

What is going on, Joss?

39:49.700 --> 39:53.555
Is this really all about
my work and Jonathan?

39:54.137 --> 39:56.439
[Sighing] No.

39:56.473 --> 40:00.476
I-It's more about us.

40:00.511 --> 40:03.012
I feel like we're moving
in different directions.

40:03.046 --> 40:07.183
As long as you're blinded by
the fame and the perks and all,

40:07.217 --> 40:10.987
I just... I don't really see
where I fit in.

40:11.021 --> 40:12.588
That doesn't... It's just not fair.

40:12.623 --> 40:14.257
You've always wanted me
to chase my dreams.

40:14.291 --> 40:17.593
Yeah, but your dreams,
t-they... they're different now.

40:17.628 --> 40:20.930
You know, they used to be
about the bistro and us.

40:20.964 --> 40:25.601
Okay, look, I have worked
really hard to get here,

40:25.636 --> 40:27.537
and I know that it's turning
into a crazy ride,

40:27.571 --> 40:29.205
but I'd really like you
to join me on it.

40:29.239 --> 40:30.606
And if you can't or you won't,

40:30.641 --> 40:32.341
then don't make me feel bad
for enjoying it.

40:32.376 --> 40:34.677
Okay, well, maybe it's just not
a ride that I want to be on.

40:34.711 --> 40:36.546
Well, maybe if you'd explain
why, then it would help,

40:36.580 --> 40:38.481
but instead, you keep lying
and you keep being distant.

40:38.515 --> 40:40.283
And you know what...
You still haven't even told me

40:40.317 --> 40:41.551
what happened that night at Calista's.

40:41.585 --> 40:43.953
Now is not the time to talk about that.

40:43.987 --> 40:46.221
- It's never the time, though, is it?
- No.

40:48.425 --> 40:50.726
You know what? We are moving
in different directions, Joss.

40:50.761 --> 40:54.330
But it is obviously
your choice, not mine.

40:55.866 --> 40:56.933
Wh...

40:58.702 --> 41:00.536
[Sighs]

41:00.571 --> 41:04.674
And since there is nothing
else to say, apparently...
