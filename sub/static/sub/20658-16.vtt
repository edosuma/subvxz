Oh, yeah, it's me and Emily's
very first play date.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.085
Don't call it that.
Call it a friend hang.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.586
It's less weird.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.089
Oh, yeah, 'cause she's
my best friend.
Perfect.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.724
Just don't overwhelm her with
your little trivia jokes, okay?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.925
It's not trivia.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.428
It's a half-hour informational

Here, take some money.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.938
I get paid for the show.
I don't need help.

You can still cancel

Nah, it's too late, I already
paid for parking.

I'm kidding.

Parking was free.

Hey, I'm just pumped you wanted
to go shopping,

01:00.060 --> 01:02.596
because I need to pick up fight
shorts for my jiu-jitsu class,

01:02.630 --> 01:06.300
and protein powder, so I can get
bulked up for my honeymoon.

I'm trying to really fill out

Speaking of which, let's hit up
Victoria's Secret.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.141
Oh, did you know
Victoria's Secret

01:13.174 --> 01:15.309
was originally marketed
as a store for men?

01:15.343 --> 01:17.111
It was supposed to be a sexy
place where they could

01:17.145 --> 01:19.247
buy underpants for their
wives and girlfriends.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.650
It wasn't until Leslie Wexner
bought the brand in 1982 that--

Wait, you know what?
I am not doing this today.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.055

Hmm, remarkable restraint.

Okay, we'll ditch
the underpants hut,

ruin the mall,

great deals and...

Advertising, racism?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.134
Little bugs?
Nope.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.270
There are simply
way too many of them.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.206
It all started in 1956

02:18.239 --> 02:20.274
when an Austrian architect
named Victor Gruen

02:20.308 --> 02:21.842
invented the modern mall.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.111
I immediately regret this.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.881
(Austrian-German accent)
The mall shall be an
indoor town square

02:27.915 --> 02:30.384
where people can
not only shop,

02:30.418 --> 02:34.722
but live and work and build a
community.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.891
It shall be... utopia!

02:37.925 --> 02:41.562
But his beautiful dream was
corrupted by greedy developers.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.297
In the '50s,
a legal loophole

02:43.331 --> 02:45.533
turned new developments
into tax shelters,

02:45.566 --> 02:48.001
and nothing sheltered
more taxes than malls.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.703
Hmm.

As a result,
there was virtually

02:58.512 --> 03:00.581
no way to lose money
building them.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.116
I'm gonna build
a whole mess of these!

03:04.618 --> 03:06.186
By the 1970s,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.155
we had built
huge numbers of malls

03:08.188 --> 03:10.491
all across America because
of this loophole.

Yeah, if you hate
the regular mall,

why don't we just
go to the outlets?

03:41.154 --> 03:43.257
Outlets are amazing.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.293

sewing the clothes

03:45.326 --> 03:46.694
or stocking their inventory,

03:46.727 --> 03:48.896
and then we get them sweet,
sweet discounts.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.231
Oops.
This one's made of gold.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.401
And it's only $5.
I win!

03:53.434 --> 03:54.968
Suck it, corporation!

03:55.002 --> 03:56.904
See? Outlets are how
customers like us

big, bad companies.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.810
Yes, that is what
they want you to think,

04:02.843 --> 04:05.913
but the truth is, these aren't
factory rejects at all.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.948
They're just cheap,
low-quality clothes

04:07.981 --> 04:10.884
that the retailer is
pretending are overstock.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.486
No.
Yep.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.156
Some estimate that 85% of
clothes sold in outlets

04:16.189 --> 04:19.960
were actually manufactured
exclusively for the outlets.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.497
What?
That's crazy!

04:23.531 --> 04:25.899
And Gap openly admits
that at their outlets,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.835
it's 100%.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.136
Think about it.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.172
There are over 12,000 outlet
stores throughout the U.S.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.508
How could factories be
making enough "mistakes"

04:34.542 --> 04:36.410
to stock them all?

04:36.444 --> 04:39.179
Okay, but then why are the
clothes so deeply discounted?

04:39.212 --> 04:41.515
I mean...
Look at this price tag.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.284
The MSRP was 1,000.
Now it's seven.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.853
That's...

04:45.886 --> 04:48.589
99.3% off?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.723
Score!

04:51.392 --> 04:53.260
That seemed personal.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.662
Sorry, but at outlets,

04:54.695 --> 04:58.999
the MSRP is usually a fake
number that the store makes up

04:59.032 --> 05:01.435
to make it look like the garment
was once worth a lot.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.671
But in reality,
that's a $7 dress

05:03.704 --> 05:05.539
and they're selling it for $7.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.874
(fabric tearing)

05:06.907 --> 05:09.142
You know,
you may be right.

05:09.176 --> 05:13.514
MSRP should really stand for
Mall Scam: Real Problem.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.315
(rimshot)

05:15.349 --> 05:17.618
You jokes were better
last season.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.521
So, yeah. I mean, the clothes
are a little cheap.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.155
It's not like
they're made of dust.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.223
Oh.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.225
To get these prices,
clothing made for outlets

05:25.258 --> 05:28.228
is often of noticeably
lower quality.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.563
Ugh.
Hold up.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.565
Look at that brand name.
This is designer.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.633
Give it to me!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.468
Oh, God!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

05:34.502 --> 05:38.138
Garbage dress!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.973
So who cares if it's
a little cheap?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.743
I mean, this is the only way
I can afford this fancy brand.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.380
Except this wasn't made
by the brand at all.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.249
Luxury brands often outsource
their outlet merch

05:49.282 --> 05:52.420
to cheaper manufacturers then
slap on the fancy label.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.589
Goodbye sucks.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.158
Hello Saks.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.493
How can they
get away with that?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.928
I can answer that.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.430
Aah!
Someone's in here!

06:02.463 --> 06:04.164
Don't worry, we're all
girls here.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.833
Ooh, so nice to be included.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.701
Emily, this is
Dr. Laura McAndrews.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.570
She researches
the fashion industry

06:09.603 --> 06:11.004
at the University
of Georgia.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.107
Honestly, this is an open secret
in the industry.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.276
When I was with The Gap in
product development,

06:16.309 --> 06:18.512
we never communicated with
the outlet team.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.881
We were completely different
supply chains.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.116
Different yarns,
different fabrics,

06:23.150 --> 06:24.785
even different factories.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.020
We basically were a different
company.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.457
Then how can they call it
an outlet store?

06:29.490 --> 06:33.126
Ultimately, you can call
anything an outlet
or a factory store.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.462
The term has no meaning.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.363
I feel so lied to.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.532
Yeah. Outlet stores
are so deceptive

06:38.566 --> 06:42.470
that four senators have asked
the FDC to investigate them.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.638
Well, maybe I'll just shop
at Forever 21.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.140
Or in my case, Forever 32.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.043
Frankly, traditional retailers
aren't much better.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.480
You can't believe anything you
read on a label.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.649
Clothing today is made so
quickly and so cheaply,

06:55.683 --> 06:58.118
they're basically designed to
fall apart.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.554
Fast fashion is killing the
clothing industry.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.456
Oh, good.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.959
Glad you looped all of fashion
in and ruined all of my clothes.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.161
Thanks, I guess.
Yeah, thanks.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.665
By the way, Adam, that suit is
not flattering.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.233
I wouldn't buy it.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.603
I'm not trying this on.
I own this.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.839
Despite what they
want you to think,

07:18.872 --> 07:20.741
you're not getting
a deal at the outlets.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.243
You're paying full price
for crap.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.514
Well, this is still all I can
afford on a teacher's salary,

07:26.547 --> 07:30.017
so I guess I'll buy
these ripoff scam shorts.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.357
You know, I've been coming to
outlets since I was 12.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.960
I was totally fine
not knowing this.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.129
I'm sorry, Emily.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.431
I'm still learning how
to chill with my buds.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.966
Is that what adults call it?

07:45.999 --> 07:49.703
Well, bud, it's all right.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.339
I just-- You know, I just hope
you got it out of your system.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.041
Yeah, I did, I promise.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.275
Okay. Cool.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.010
So, only one more errand.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.614
I gotta stop at the supplement
store so I can bulk up.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.282
Supplements?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.485
But those can actually
kill you.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.020
No, I gotta tell her!

08:07.054 --> 08:08.989
Emily, wait!

08:15.162 --> 08:17.197
♪♪

08:17.230 --> 08:19.466
I'm gonna get so ripped.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.302
I'll take this giant tub of Hoko
Milk so I can get huge, please.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.571
Emily, stop!

08:23.604 --> 08:24.972
Supplements are
a completely

08:25.005 --> 08:27.407
unregulated game of
Russian roulette.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.743
Well, a lot of Russians
are pretty jacked.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.079
But also, what did you
just promise me?

08:32.112 --> 08:35.583
I know, but what's in that
bottle can be really dangerous.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.017
Okay.
What are you talking about?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.386
People use supplements
all the time to lose weight

08:39.419 --> 08:41.421
or bulk up or improve
their health.

08:41.454 --> 08:42.656
You know, I read somewhere

08:42.690 --> 08:44.758
that 50% of Americans
take supplements.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.594
Right. And that's
a big problem,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.495
because supplements
have been found to contain

08:48.528 --> 08:50.197
illicit and dangerous
chemicals,

08:50.230 --> 08:52.065
like undisclosed allergens.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.066

08:53.100 --> 08:54.034

08:55.302 --> 08:57.605
And even Viagra.

(gulps)

08:59.640 --> 09:02.409
Isn't anyone checking
what goes into these?

09:02.442 --> 09:03.410
No.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.578
Before they hit the shelves,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.379
literally no one does.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.948
Anything could be
in those bottles.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.282
But how is that possible?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.218
Oh, stork!
You got me!

09:11.251 --> 09:14.221
To learn more,
let's go back in time!

09:14.254 --> 09:16.690
Back in the early 1900s,
quack doctors

09:16.724 --> 09:19.860
could put anything in a bottle
and call it medicine.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.864
Step right up and try Professor
Hokorium's extreme snake oil!

09:23.897 --> 09:26.634
Contains absolutely no beef,
fat or lead.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.435
This tastes like steak
and paint chips.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.037
You're wrong!

09:30.070 --> 09:32.472
So to stop these
charlatans from straight-up
killing people,

09:32.505 --> 09:34.474
we regulated
the drug industry.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.044
Blast! I made a fortune
off that beef lead!

09:37.077 --> 09:39.980
But those standards were never
applied to supplements,

09:40.013 --> 09:42.883
and in 1994, the industry
lobbied Congress

09:42.916 --> 09:45.919
to cripple the FDA's ability
to investigate them.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.788
And now we're back
to the bad old days

09:47.821 --> 09:49.657
when any bozo could put
whatever they want

09:49.690 --> 09:51.324
in a bottle and sell it.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.628
The only thing that's changed
is the facial hair.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.497
Step right up
and try Hoko Milk!

09:57.530 --> 10:02.670
I swear, it contains absolutely
no illegal steroids or lead.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.938
This big, dumb ape
can mix together

10:04.972 --> 10:06.640
whatever crazy chemicals
he wants,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.676
call it a "proprietary blend"

10:08.709 --> 10:11.511
and no one will stand between
him and the store shelves.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.014
Chad not big ape!

10:15.683 --> 10:16.917
Aah!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.285
Yikes!

10:19.519 --> 10:20.688
Go, go, go!

10:20.721 --> 10:22.022
Jump!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.658
Whoo.
Okay.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.326
Well, that's just
the boner pills

10:26.359 --> 10:27.828
and the crazy
meathead stuff.

10:27.861 --> 10:32.032
I'll find an all-natural way
to get swole as hell.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.600
Like this.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.035
There's just one ingredient.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.536
Plant.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.706
Sorry, but even herbal
supplements

10:38.739 --> 10:41.174
like ginseng, gingko biloba
and Echinacea

10:41.208 --> 10:42.542
have their own problem.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.877
Plant fraud.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.545
Here, I'll show you!

10:48.181 --> 10:50.951
A study that DNA-tested
herbal supplements found

10:50.984 --> 10:54.387
that a third of them contain no
trace of the advertised plant.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.890
Research showed instead,
they contained fillers

10:56.924 --> 11:02.062
like powdered rice, wheat
and even laxatives.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.296
Yeech.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.832
But I'm allergic to wheat.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.067
Isn't anyone checking what
goes into these products?

11:07.100 --> 11:10.170
Well, there are 15,000
supplement manufacturers,

11:10.203 --> 11:13.406
but the FDA only conducts
400 inspections a year.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.742
And when they do inspect them,

11:14.775 --> 11:18.145
manufacturers fail
60% of the time.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.246
What the--

11:19.279 --> 11:21.915
Aah!
A pill monster!

11:21.949 --> 11:24.251
Oh, no, it's Dr. Joshua
Sharfstein.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.319
He's a former deputy
commissioner of the FDA

11:26.353 --> 11:28.188
and a professor
at Johns Hopkins.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.157
I didn't expect to see you in
there, Dr. Sharfstein.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.725
Well, like a lot of things
in this bottle,

11:31.759 --> 11:33.160
I'm not on the label.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.863
The truth is, the FDA has
so little authority here,

11:35.896 --> 11:38.431
the agency can't take action
to protect the public

11:38.465 --> 11:40.167
until after someone is hurt.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.269
One herbal product,
Ephedra,

11:42.302 --> 11:44.037
was linked to more than
100 deaths,

11:44.071 --> 11:46.439
but because of industry
pressure and a weak law,

11:46.473 --> 11:49.242
the agency took nearly ten years
to get it off the market.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.778
That's terrible.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.281
I mean, these are sold at drug
stores, next to the drugs.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.750
And drugs are
well-regulated by FDA,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.618
but when it comes to
dietary supplements,

11:58.651 --> 12:00.453
the agency literally
does not know

12:00.487 --> 12:02.790
what it is in the bottles
that are on the shelves.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.858
And this problem is only
going to get worse,

12:04.892 --> 12:08.528
because supplements are
a $32 billion-a-year industry.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.763
Holy crap.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.198
I should get in on that.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.800
You can!
Our producers looked into it.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
They found a supplement company
willing to manufacture

12:15.435 --> 12:18.471
a formula I came up with
for less than four grand,

12:18.505 --> 12:20.808
even though I'm a comedian
with no medical training.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.142
The only reason
we didn't do it

12:22.175 --> 12:24.211
is the network said
it was too dangerous.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.478
Go figure.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.247
Until FDA has
the authority to know

12:27.280 --> 12:29.482
what's actually in
dietary supplements,

12:29.516 --> 12:32.719
consumers will continue to be
exposed to unnecessary risks.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.455
(Adam)
Thanks, Dr. Sharfstein.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.390
(rumbling)

12:37.424 --> 12:38.691
(yelling)

12:40.693 --> 12:42.963
What happened to
Dr. Sharf... stein?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.932
(Dr. Sharfstein) Wait!
You might be allergic to me!

12:44.965 --> 12:45.866
(gulps)

12:48.335 --> 12:50.503
This is such a bummer.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.841
I just wanted, like,
a little bit of control
over my own health.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.076
Isn't there anything
we can do?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.111
Well, the FDA knows
it's a problem,

12:58.145 --> 12:59.412
but because of these laws,

12:59.446 --> 13:02.182
they have no authority
to stop it.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.651
Come on, show me
what's in the box.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.853
No way.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.655
FDA stands for
frickin' diddly authority.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.423
(rimshot, register dings)

13:10.457 --> 13:12.659
Unfortunately,
until the law is changed,

13:12.692 --> 13:14.627
millions of Americans
will keep taking

13:14.661 --> 13:17.530
largely unregulated products
full of mystery ingredients

13:17.564 --> 13:20.968
that, worst-case scenario,
could kill them.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.603
Oh, crap, I did it again.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.105
I'm so sorry.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.874
No.
It's okay.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.708
Supplements sound really
dangerous.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.943
I'm glad I know.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.045
Well, the good news is,
I am done for the day.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.780
Ruin complete!

13:33.813 --> 13:36.549
Now, I just gotta hit
the eyeglasses store
for my weekly eye exam,

13:36.583 --> 13:39.286
and trust me, there is
nothing wrong with that.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.520
(laughing)

13:40.553 --> 13:42.155
Actually...
(snaps fingers)

13:42.189 --> 13:45.758
♪♪

13:46.826 --> 13:49.029
♪♪

13:51.098 --> 13:52.465
Afternoon, Pierre.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.168
Adam!
It's been too long.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.404
Is that a new pocket square?
New to you.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.806
How's Madeleine?
She agreed to a second date.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.808
I told you she was
sweet on you.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.510
And how are your loved ones?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.145
My turtles?
They're quite well.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.679
What do you got for me?

14:06.713 --> 14:09.749
Well, we have a number of
new styles to show you.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.685
So many styles.
How do I choose?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.421
Ooh, flirty.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.588
Classic.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
Tre fashionable.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.725
Daring 'do.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.760
Actually, all these frames
are exactly the same.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.162
Ahh!

14:22.195 --> 14:24.231
I'm sorry,
she's a contacts person.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.832
She doesn't understand us.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.734
These are clearly
different brands.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.269
No, they're not.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.504
I'm the Adam now.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.073
Think about this
for a second.

14:33.106 --> 14:37.010
Even the most basic pair of
glasses can cost around $400.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.279
That's as much as my phone.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.781
Haven't you ever wondered why
a simple piece of plastic

14:41.814 --> 14:44.584
is the same price as this
miracle of technology?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.386
No, and you can't make me!

14:46.419 --> 14:48.355
I love glasses too much!

14:48.388 --> 14:49.957
Uugghh!

14:49.990 --> 14:51.891
Ooh, the power
of knowledge.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.594
80% of glasses
and sunglasses brands

14:54.627 --> 14:59.799
are controlled by a single
company, Luxottica.

14:59.832 --> 15:03.103
But that would give them
a virtual monopoly over
the entire industry.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.471
Bingo.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.939
And because
they control both

15:05.973 --> 15:07.640
the luxury brands
and the cheap brands,

15:07.674 --> 15:09.876
they can charge whatever
they want for either.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.144
No, I'm not seeing this.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.813
I'm sorry.
You have to.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.782
Luxottica uses that power

15:15.815 --> 15:18.385
to drive up the price of
glasses for everybody,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.554
sometimes charging
as much as 20 times
what they cost to produce.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.323
All right.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.592
And it's not just
prescription glasses.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.095
Ray-Bans used to be
bargain mass-market sunglasses

15:28.128 --> 15:31.664
worn by everyone from
jazz men to presidents

15:31.698 --> 15:33.633
to president jazz man.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.336
But in 1999,
Luxottica bought the brand

15:36.369 --> 15:39.506
and raised the price to over
$150 a pair,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.008
quintuple what they were.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.610
Maybe they're five times better
at banning rays now?

15:43.643 --> 15:47.014
Get out of here, ray!
You're banned!

15:47.047 --> 15:49.749
Oh, the ideas your hair has.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.187
70% of Luxottica's brands come
from the exact same factory.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.823
This one's Prada.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.326
This one's nada.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.693
Hey.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.695
This is just like what you did
with clothing outlets.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.431
Ooh, this is karma.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.665
I hate this.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.334
Glasses are really
important to me.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.702
They're, like,
40% of my personality.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.038
Oh, suck it up.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.206
You know, we don't have to
teleport everywhere.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.442
We can walk
around the store.
Why?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.177
Well, I'm a smart boy,
and I know what to do.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.179
I'll just go to
a different store.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.814
Good luck!
What is happening?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.150
It's simple.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.386
Luxottica also owns almost all
the major glasses stores, too.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.455
Including LensCrafters,
Pearle Vision,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.990
Sears Optical, Target Optical
and Sunglass Hut.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.126
Which means that the few brands
that they don't own

16:33.160 --> 16:34.894
are forced to obey
their demands.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.730
When Oakley tried to dispute
Luxottica's pricing,

16:37.764 --> 16:41.334
Luxottica retaliated by dropping
them from all their stores.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.403
Oakley's stock price collapsed

16:43.436 --> 16:45.838
and Luxottica swooped in
and bought them out.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.707
Luxottica has so much power,

16:47.740 --> 16:49.842
that when a company didn't
play by their rules,

16:49.876 --> 16:51.644
they brought them to the brink
of destruction

16:51.678 --> 16:54.214
then took over that company.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.084
I've never felt bad for someone
wearing Oakleys before.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.519
Oh, I still get plenty of
action.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.987
Wow, I know you're not
the bad guy,

17:01.020 --> 17:02.755
but you are real unlikeable.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.857
Whatever, tits.
Uhh!

17:04.891 --> 17:06.693
But I have to wear glasses.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.096
I don't have a choice.
Good point.

17:09.129 --> 17:13.433
For 75% of Americans, glasses
are a medical necessity.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.603
Too bad Luxottica also owns

17:16.636 --> 17:19.939
the second-largest eye insurance
company in America.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.275
That means it's possible
for your optometrist,

17:22.309 --> 17:23.943
your insurance company,

17:23.976 --> 17:25.912
the factory that makes
your frames

17:25.945 --> 17:28.115
and the store that
sells them to you

17:28.148 --> 17:30.283
to all be owned by
the same company.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.352
So they can just rip us off?

17:32.385 --> 17:36.289
Everything is worth what people
are ready to pay, eh?

17:36.323 --> 17:37.757
Okay, that's awfully cynical.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.259
Yeah, and it's also
a real thing

17:39.292 --> 17:41.461
that their CEO said
to "60 Minutes."

17:41.494 --> 17:43.430
The fact is,
most of these glasses

17:43.463 --> 17:45.298
could just be
labeled Luxottica,

17:45.332 --> 17:46.533
but they're not,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.968
because what Luxottica
is really selling you

17:49.001 --> 17:50.903
is the illusion of choice.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.773
Et tu, Pierre?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.442
I'm sorry, Adam.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.278
I'm not who you think I am.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.714
No!

18:01.748 --> 18:03.416
So, what'd you think
of my lesson?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.318
Pretty cool, huh?

18:05.352 --> 18:07.387
No, it wasn't.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.257
I-I loved coming here.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.292
And you took that from me.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.462
Is this what it feels like to
have something ruined for you?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.965

It feels horrible.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.939
I mean, yeah,
it sucks at first,

18:59.972 --> 19:03.476
but in the end,
it's better to know, right?

19:03.510 --> 19:07.647
How is it better to lose
my favorite store?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.383
Well, actually,
now that we shop online,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.385
Luxottica has lost
a lot of power.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.287
I mean, a ton of
independent retailers

19:14.321 --> 19:16.723
are going around them and
selling to consumers directly.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.527
So that way, I can buy more
glasses for less money.

a little grating.

I now know not to
put garbage in my body

Remember that tax loophole
from act one?

19:56.463 --> 19:59.432
Well, it led to the construction
of so many unneeded malls

19:59.466 --> 20:01.334
that the market was
oversaturated,

20:01.368 --> 20:04.937

claustrophobic shopping
centers are failing.
