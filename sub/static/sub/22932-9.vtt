00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:06.460 --> 00:08.960
Mmm, I can smell those
polvorónes from here.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.460
I don't know how much longer
I can wait.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.920
Why can't you invent something
that cools cookies instantly?

00:14.920 --> 00:16.750
You think I haven't been
working on that?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.460
You're seeing something you
don't see a lot:

00:19.460 --> 00:22.080
us excited for food to come
out of that kitchen.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.040
Which only means one thing.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.000
Mom and Dad are gone,
and Abuela's at the helm.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.380
Don't tell them
I said that.

00:28.380 --> 00:32.420
Mom trying is almost worse
than her not.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.830
Here they come.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.830
Stand back, people.
I'm going in mouth-first.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.420
Okay, when I put these
on the table,

00:38.420 --> 00:41.580
give me to the count of three
before anyone dives in.

00:41.580 --> 00:44.040
I don't want to lose
a finger.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.710
On three?

00:45.710 --> 00:47.380
Or one, two, three, go?

00:48.790 --> 00:50.040
And they're gone.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.420
I guess it was
the first one.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.080
I think Abuela was only
half-joking

00:54.080 --> 00:55.120
about losing a finger.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.670
We all know about the curse.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.670
Every time she visits,
something bad happens.

00:59.670 --> 01:02.420
Wait till you try
Abuela's special marinade.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.500
I spent hours--

01:05.710 --> 01:07.250
Accidents.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.580
Did someone leave
these doors open?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.170
Mayhem.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.000
This is it.
Six long months,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.250
and we finally find out
who wins "American Voice."

01:18.250 --> 01:22.080
Ooh, just in time
for Ping-Pong regionals.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.580
And fighting.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
George,
give us the remote!

01:29.580 --> 01:32.250
After that, she didn't come by
for a long time.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.290
She says this stuff
never happens at Uncle Chick's.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.790
To be fair, he lives
in a high-rise

01:35.790 --> 01:38.040
with less people
and fewer raccoons.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.080
But if we want Abuela
to ever come back,

01:40.080 --> 01:42.460
we need to make sure
her trip goes smoothly.

01:42.460 --> 01:45.540
Make sure to save some cookies
for the rest of the family

01:45.540 --> 01:48.460
for when they come back
from their trip!

01:55.080 --> 01:58.080
My Harley curse-proofed
the house?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.620
Yup. Nothing bad's happening
on this trip.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.500
I refitted this door with the
same kind of heavy-duty hinges

02:03.500 --> 02:06.420
they use on gates
and barns.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.790
Which, if you've seen
our family eat, is appropriate.

02:09.790 --> 02:11.920
-And, Abuela, look at this.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.500
I made those
self-closing.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.620
Nothing's sneaking in here.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.460
And we agreed,
no TV while you're here,

02:23.460 --> 02:25.120
so we don't fight
over the remote.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.120
And so we spend
more time with you.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.790
I was supposed to say
the second part first.

02:29.790 --> 02:32.620
Looks like you thought
of everything.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.540
But to be safe,

02:34.540 --> 02:36.880
I'm still wearing
my religious medals.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.080
And that's how
you curse-proof a...

02:42.420 --> 02:45.620

"Frankenstein went to the bakery
for a piece of apricot pie."

03:44.580 --> 03:46.620
If this is some weird
novel you wrote,

03:46.620 --> 03:48.620
I'm finding some plot holes.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.790
No, these are specific sentences
I found online.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.120
Once I record you,
I can manipulate the sounds

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000
to create virtually
any phrase.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.580
Watch.

04:00.380 --> 04:01.670
Go ahead.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.620
Look out,
got a roller in the house.

04:07.620 --> 04:08.960
And this is just
the beginning.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.710
We're starting with you,
but once I record everyone,

04:11.710 --> 04:15.880
you can choose whichever Diaz
you want to cheer you on.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.330
Roll again.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.580
Amazing, Harley.
You're a genius.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.880
Machine's just saying
what we've all been thinking.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.920
Happy to help. It'll get my mind
off that bone-headed mistake

04:27.920 --> 04:29.500
I made with Chloe.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.670
Yeah, for a girl who could never
finish her sentences,

04:32.670 --> 04:34.420
she sure could end
a relationship.

04:35.420 --> 04:36.670
What happened, exactly?

04:36.670 --> 04:38.290
It's pretty embarrassing.

04:38.290 --> 04:40.620
You have to promise
to keep it between us.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.380
I promise.
Flea-az Diaz-style.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.710
If you're going to hear it,

04:45.710 --> 04:48.080
you have to keep it
Flea-az Diaz-style too.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.670
That means you tell no one.

04:50.670 --> 04:54.670
See, when I was little,
I caught fleas,

04:54.670 --> 04:57.710
and it spread to my whole family
at a reunion.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.540
The only person I told
was Ethan.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.880
Not only did he keep my secret,

05:00.880 --> 05:02.500
he rode his bike
to the store

05:02.500 --> 05:05.790
and spent his allowance
on special shampoo.

05:05.790 --> 05:08.620
Now, whenever we have a secret
that's just between us,

05:08.620 --> 05:11.790
we call it
a Flea-az Diaz promise.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.750
Chloe and I were kind of
at that place

05:13.750 --> 05:16.620
where you decide if the two
of you are a thing or not.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.790
I had just downed
two chili dogs with onions,

05:18.790 --> 05:20.830
when she offered me a lick
of her ice cream.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.250
I didn't want to be rude,
so I went in.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.120
And that's when I was revisited

05:25.120 --> 05:26.620
by Mr. Chili's
super bean combo.

05:27.830 --> 05:31.290
I belched my relationship
out of the park, literally.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.830
After that embarrassment,

05:32.830 --> 05:35.250
I don't think I could ever
look her in the eye again.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.710
Not that she'd ever
let me get close enough.

05:40.710 --> 05:42.420
Only the good sheets
for Abuela.

05:42.420 --> 05:45.380
No stains,
and they almost match.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.000
Isn't it nice
having her here?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
For some more than others.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.880
-Come on, Georgie,

05:50.880 --> 05:53.040
get your head
out of the sand.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.580
I know you saw it.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.830
Ah, my littlest fruit.

05:57.830 --> 06:00.250
Mm-mm-mm!

06:00.250 --> 06:02.540
My athlete.

06:02.540 --> 06:05.420
Mm-mm-mm!

06:05.420 --> 06:08.040
My little Tomás Edison.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.750
Mm-mm-mm-mm!

06:13.710 --> 06:16.670
Okay, Harley got
a bonus squeeze,

06:16.670 --> 06:17.670
I saw it.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.830
Face it, Harley is Abuela's
favorite.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.420
You're right.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.170
I guess it makes sense.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.380
Harley always gives
the extra effort.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.170
Organizing the Christmas trip,

06:28.170 --> 06:29.960
making Abuela an ornament
every year.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.670
She even curse-proofed
the house.

06:31.670 --> 06:33.710
She's kind of a bootlick
that way.

06:33.710 --> 06:37.120
If we tried we could be too,
but kissing up is pathetic.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.580
So you get
a few bonus hugs.

06:39.580 --> 06:42.250
It's not worth
selling yourself out.

06:44.790 --> 06:45.960
Once I finish this,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.460
you'll have your pick
of gentlemen

06:47.460 --> 06:48.830
at the retirement
community.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.040
I got news for you, princesa.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.880
I already do.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.830
What's going on here?

06:56.830 --> 06:58.960
Georgie's having me
sleep in her room

06:58.960 --> 07:01.210
so the two of us
can have a girls' night.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.250
So there is a brain
under all that hair.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.210
Abuela, will you cut up
my breakfast for me?

07:13.210 --> 07:16.460
Of course I will, mija.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.750
As much as I'm all for her
not having a knife,

07:23.750 --> 07:25.960
she's been cutting up
her own food for years now.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.330
Well, Abuela does it
the best.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.830
Can you feed it to me?

07:31.670 --> 07:33.170
Of course.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.880
Coming in for a landing.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.420
Yum, yummy.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.120
I could eat you up.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.540
Yes, I'd love to put
a fork in her too.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.880
Well, so far we've made it
through a day with no accidents,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.790
fighting or mayhem.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.500
Pretty curse-free,
I'd say.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.000
Hey, let's take a picture
so we can show Mom and Dad

07:57.000 --> 07:59.040
what a good time
we're all having.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.880
Make sure you go
nice and high.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.830
I learned that
at the senior center

08:04.830 --> 08:06.290
in my "How to Take a Selfie"
class.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.250
Say "queso."

08:09.250 --> 08:10.830
Queso!

08:12.380 --> 08:13.790
I'll clear the table, Abuela.

08:13.790 --> 08:15.960
-No, I will.
-I said, I will.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.120
Fighting over
who gets to clean?

08:18.120 --> 08:21.960
You girls are amazing.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.620
-I got it!
-I got it!

08:23.620 --> 08:25.120
Let me make sure
we don't have red eye.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.880
Don't want Mom and Dad thinking
we all caught another infection.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.960
I don't believe it.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.830
My own brother
went behind my back

08:41.830 --> 08:43.750
to hang out
with my worst enemy.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.710
Why is there a picture of you at
a comic book store with Aidan?

08:47.710 --> 08:50.040
-Just our neighbor.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.080
I, uh, ran into him
at the comic book store.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.830
Totally begged me
for a picture.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.250
Awkward.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.000
This one's of you guys
eating jumbo shrimp.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.540
It was "buy one comic,
get shrimp free."

09:05.540 --> 09:06.880
Sounds fun.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.330
Will I get to meet
this Aidan?

09:08.330 --> 09:09.580
-No!
-No!

09:09.580 --> 09:12.040
Ethan, can you please help me

09:12.040 --> 09:13.540
get something
from the garage?

09:13.540 --> 09:16.540
I should stay and help Abuela
with the dishes.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.380
Where it's well lit,
there are no shovels,

09:19.380 --> 09:20.830
and several exits.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.080
Go, go.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.080
I've got the butter dish, too,
Abuela.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.330
Oh!

09:30.750 --> 09:32.710
Nice try, short arms.

09:32.710 --> 09:35.250
This isn't over.

09:37.290 --> 09:38.920
How could you hang out
with Aidan?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.500
Why would you hang out
with Aidan?

09:40.500 --> 09:43.040
You're the one who said to put
him on the "Dead to Diaz" list.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.120
I know, but it turns out
we have a lot in common.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.710
Totally.
You're both jerks.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.290
I was going to say
we read the same comics.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.040
But, yes,
point well taken.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.170
I haven't talked
to him since.

09:54.170 --> 09:56.250
But still, it was wrong.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.250
So go ahead,
call me a weasel.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.460
Call me spineless.
Make fun of my guitar playing.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.380
Though, in fairness,
it's come a long way.

10:02.380 --> 10:05.120
Have at it, yell at me.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.960
I don't need to.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.830
I'm not mad. I'm hurt.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.920
Oh, no, that's worse.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.880
I'm begging you, yell at me.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.830
You said you're sorry,
and I believe you.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.040
If living in this family
has taught me anything,

10:21.040 --> 10:23.000
it's that everyone makes
mistakes.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.920
Besides, Abuela's here.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.540
If she hears us fighting,
she'll blame the curse.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.500
Thanks, Harls.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.000
Well, I'll go grab some lights
to decorate the game room.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.920
That way I don't look
suspicious.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.420
Well, if we don't want
to look suspicious,

10:36.420 --> 10:38.960
I should go sit on the couch
and complain I ate too much.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.120
And then later,
I won't help make lunch.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.380
Just to be safe.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.120
So, I finished
cleaning the kitchen.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.170
What's going on here?

10:54.170 --> 10:56.380
Abuela and I
are just chatting.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.120
In Spanish.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.380
Her native tongue.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.000
Her Spanish is really improving.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.620
It's from reading
all the Spanish books

11:11.620 --> 11:13.790
Abuela's been sending.

11:13.790 --> 11:17.380
You've been reading yours,
right, Georgie?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.420
Sí.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.960
Not sure if you're aware
of this,

11:27.960 --> 11:30.080
but Christmas
is a long ways away.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.540
Not sure if you're aware,

11:31.540 --> 11:33.250
but you live on the other side
of the fence.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.330
Just getting a lacrosse ball
I shot over here.

11:35.330 --> 11:36.880
Sorry to bug you.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.040
Ha! Listen to me.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.880
I just said "bug"
to Flea-az Diaz.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.040
Ethan totally revealed
my deepest secret,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.790
I can't get back at him
because Abuela's here,

11:49.790 --> 11:51.920
and these Christmas lights
are tangled!

11:55.330 --> 11:57.290
Look, I'm taking Abuela
to dance aerobics

11:57.290 --> 11:58.710
to have some alone time
with her.

11:58.710 --> 12:01.580
I know you're going
to want to come, but for once--

12:01.580 --> 12:04.120
You're taking Abuela out
of the house for a few hours?

12:04.120 --> 12:05.380
Perfect!

12:05.380 --> 12:06.620
Great.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.880
This isn't a trick
to give you time

12:10.880 --> 12:12.080
to make some super invention

12:12.080 --> 12:13.960
Abuela's going to love,
is it?

12:15.290 --> 12:18.880
What I'm planning has absolutely
nothing to do with Abuela.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.670
Or love.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.080
I hope your leggings
are extra stretchy.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.040
I hear this dance aerobics class
is taught by someone

12:27.040 --> 12:28.960
who used to tour with
Lady Gaga.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.830
I love the Gaga.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.210
And I love that you and I are
getting a little girl time,

12:33.210 --> 12:34.290
just the two of...

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
us.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.080
Are you guys
going to exercise?

12:39.080 --> 12:41.960
How convenient.
I'm already dressed.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.330
-No, actually, we're just--
-Come along.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.580
The more, the merrier.

12:44.580 --> 12:47.250
It's as Gaga
would have wanted.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.880
She's very inclusive.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.670
I thought I was going to have
to wait until Abuela left

12:56.670 --> 12:57.880
to get back at Ethan,

12:57.880 --> 13:00.580
but now I've been given
a wonderful window

13:00.580 --> 13:03.290
to fight fire with fire.

13:03.290 --> 13:06.500
Not real fire.
Don't worry, I'm not Daphne.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.580
This machine is part one.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.750
And here comes part two.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.120
Sweet revenge.

13:15.790 --> 13:19.170
Huh, maybe I am a little
like Daphne.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.540
Chloe?

13:29.420 --> 13:30.830
Hi.

13:35.790 --> 13:38.670
You invited Chloe.

13:38.670 --> 13:39.880
Great.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.670
Yeah, since we decided it's okay
to hang out with whoever,

13:42.670 --> 13:44.790
no matter what
anybody else thinks.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.960
Glad you're cool
with me being here.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.790
Thought you might find it
awkward.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.750
Not at all.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.420
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

13:52.420 --> 13:54.790
The zipper on my sweatshirt's
stuck again.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.170
Guy's a mess.
But you probably knew that by--

13:58.750 --> 14:01.250
I thought you said you forgave
me for hanging out with Aidan.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.620
Yeah, not anymore.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.250
There you go.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.210
So, where's this game room
you were telling me about?

14:09.210 --> 14:12.580
Upstairs. I think you're really
going to love it.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.750
You, not so much.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.040
So unfortunate
they had to cancel

14:19.040 --> 14:21.250
that dance aerobics class
at the last minute.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.500
Glad I called.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.750
Apparently, they had to fumigate
for rats.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.040
Great, big rats.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.330
Oh, sorry.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.790
She's too little
for our class.

14:31.790 --> 14:34.790
She'll have to wait
in the kiddie play place.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.210
Oh, no!

14:36.210 --> 14:38.670
I'm so shocked.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.670
Do I look shocked?
Because I'm totally shocked.

14:41.670 --> 14:45.580
Seems like they got
some big rats in here, too.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.330
Isn't this great?

14:50.330 --> 14:53.580
You and me, cycling through
the pretend Rockies.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.620
Sorry, no talking.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.580
Don't make
Instructor Greg mad.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.670
He might turn off
the air conditioning.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.040
Aww!

15:23.040 --> 15:26.290
I heart you too, Daphne.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.880
Yeah, I could heart her
with my bare hands!

15:32.420 --> 15:33.920
I'm just going to go
check on her.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.620
-No talking!
-Yes, I get it, Greg!

15:35.620 --> 15:37.790
-Leave it on the bike.
Yeah.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.670
Wow, you Diazes are...

16:15.420 --> 16:16.830
...fun.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.580
This game room is cool.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.080
You have a roll

16:24.710 --> 16:28.080
Remember, we don't want Abuela
to think her trip is cursed.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.750
We can't fight
while she's here.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.460
But lucky for us,
Abuela's not here.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.710
She'll be gone
all afternoon.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.170
Sorry we got us
kicked out of class.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.880
We're going
straight home.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.920
This hurts me more
than it hurts you,

16:42.920 --> 16:44.790
but no fro-yo for anyone.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.420
-Oh, knock it off.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.710
-Sí.
-You too.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.620
That is too funny.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.380
Yeah. The jackpot happens
when you get the ball

16:57.380 --> 16:58.790
in his burp hole...

16:58.790 --> 17:00.250
I mean, mouth.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.460
This isn't happening.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.120
My favorite
underwear has duckies on them.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.790
They say "Hope you don't
see my quack."

17:12.790 --> 17:14.080
It's funny.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.040
What are you doing?

17:16.040 --> 17:18.710
You spilled my secrets,
so I'm spilling yours.

17:18.710 --> 17:22.040
Step right up, roll a ball,
hear another secret.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.830
I once ate a cupcake
with my feet.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.250
Because I stepped on it.
There was cream cheese frosting

17:31.250 --> 17:33.040
between my toes, so I...

17:33.040 --> 17:34.380
I'm bored.
Are you bored?

17:34.380 --> 17:36.380
Let's go downstairs
and do any other thing.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.000
When did I tell
your secrets?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.790
You told Aidan
about Flea-az Diaz.

17:42.790 --> 17:45.040
I would have been mad if you
told anybody in the family,

17:45.040 --> 17:47.210
-No, it...

17:48.830 --> 17:50.120
Yay! Jackpot!

17:50.120 --> 17:52.040
I got a pretzel
stuck in my ear.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.330
Make it stop.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.080
I'm sorry,
it's on auto-loop now.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.080
You've got to get something
extra for a jackpot.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.210
If you won't stop it,
I will.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.120
I yawned and a bird pooped
in my mouth.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.250
-Hey, that's my invention!
-Pooped in my mouth...

18:07.250 --> 18:09.330
Shaving my chest...

18:09.330 --> 18:11.330
Pooped in my mouth...

18:11.330 --> 18:13.040
My chest...
I cried... I cried...

18:13.040 --> 18:15.880
Stop it!
What are you...?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.420
What is going on?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.420
If that's our competition,
we've been trying way too hard.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.880
That's it!
Family meeting!

18:28.830 --> 18:31.920
Since you broke
the game upstairs,

18:31.920 --> 18:33.620
I have a new one.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.880
It's called,
"Out with It."

18:35.880 --> 18:38.170
No dice, no spinners,

18:38.170 --> 18:40.670
no giant face of Ethan...

18:40.670 --> 18:43.290
though it was a very cute
picture.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.500
Debatable.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.880
What's going on with everyone?

18:46.880 --> 18:49.750
Harley, why did you program
that machine

18:49.750 --> 18:52.290
to say embarrassing things
about your brother?

18:52.290 --> 18:56.000
Because he broke
our Flea-az Diaz pact.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.620
I see.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.710
Not really. Explain.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.960
Oh, no. I'm not spilling
her biggest secret twice.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.710
You might as well know.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.290
Aidan will probably
tell you anyway.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.080
I'm the one
who gave everyone fleas

19:11.080 --> 19:12.830
at our family reunion
that year.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.710
But we had to cancel
the big family picnic.

19:16.710 --> 19:18.080
I blamed Uncle Rico
for the fleas.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.960
He has three dogs
and a lot of arm hair.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.710
It was me. I let Uncle Rico
take the fall.

19:23.710 --> 19:26.120
He was the most
obvious suspect.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
And he didn't help himself

19:27.120 --> 19:28.580
by forgetting my birthday
that year.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.960
Anyway, Ethan thought
it would be fun

19:30.960 --> 19:33.120
for Aidan to know
that story.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.790
That's not why I told him.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.960
Yeah, Harley's my BFTF.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.500
You have six other
siblings,

19:40.500 --> 19:42.250
and she's your best friend
in the family?

19:42.250 --> 19:45.080
They weren't assigned.
You do get to pick, right?

19:45.080 --> 19:46.790
It's kind of hard to explain.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.040
It'd have to be.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.920
It started
when we were little...

19:49.920 --> 19:52.290
And then you told him we're best
friends because I had fleas?

19:52.290 --> 19:54.040
That wasn't
the point of it.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.620
It's everything
that came after.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.830
When Harley got the fleas,
she came to me for help.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.920
She could have asked anyone else
in the family,

20:02.920 --> 20:05.790
but I was the one
she trusted.

20:05.790 --> 20:08.960
From that day on,
we were BFTFs.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.250
I told him that story
to make you look good.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.040
Instead, I made you
feel bad.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.620
Not as bad as telling Chloe your
secrets makes me feel right now.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.120
It's okay.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.170
But when did a bird
poop in my mouth?

20:27.170 --> 20:28.670
I made that up.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.750
It sounded funny,
so I threw it in there.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.080
But just so you know,
we're still BFTFs.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.670
And, hey, I promise,
secrets or no,

20:40.670 --> 20:42.290
I'll never speak
to Aidan again.

20:42.290 --> 20:45.040
Okay, one down...

20:45.040 --> 20:46.710
one to go.

20:48.120 --> 20:52.670
You two, what was that fight
in cycling class about?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Out with it.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.170
You love Harley
more than us.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.830
Not anymore.
You're welcome.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.500
Not ever!

21:03.500 --> 21:06.250
Mijitas, Abuela doesn't play
favorites.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.670
I'm so sorry
you felt that way.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.670
Come here.

21:10.670 --> 21:15.170
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

21:19.250 --> 21:22.120
Hey, that was one more squeeze
than Harley got.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.670
And we both got
a bonus pat.

21:23.670 --> 21:27.500
My adorable pepitas.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.460
This is the best game
of "Out with It"

21:29.460 --> 21:32.380
since Cousin Julio revealed
he was secretly married.

21:32.380 --> 21:35.040
Well, I'm glad you got
one good thing out of today,

21:35.040 --> 21:37.250
because the rest of it
was nothing but fighting.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.580
Once again,
your trip was cursed.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.120
Fighting isn't a curse.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.750
Every family fights.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.880
But last time we fought
you said your visit was cursed,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.500
and you didn't come back
for months.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.290
The fighting wasn't the curse.

21:49.290 --> 21:51.040
It's what the fighting caused.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.250
You kids broke the remote.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.920
I didn't get to watch
the season finale

21:55.920 --> 21:58.420
of my favorite telenovela.

21:58.420 --> 22:00.920
That was the curse.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.000
Oh!

22:03.000 --> 22:05.120
This trip, curse-free.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.830
Now, I was promised
a game night.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.580
Let's do it old-school.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.170
See what board games
you can dig up.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.670
Hang on, am I allowed to be mad
that Harley gave us fleas,

22:18.670 --> 22:20.330
or is it way too late
for that?

22:26.330 --> 22:27.880
Hey, look at that.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.380
Chloe just texted me saying
she wants to go out again.

22:31.380 --> 22:34.880
She thought all those secrets
made me seem interesting.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.790
I do not understand girls.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.000
I do.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.290
That's why I rigged
the machine,

22:39.290 --> 22:40.960
to get you guys
back together.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.080
You're just saying that
to make yourself feel better.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.380
Well, you understand
this girl.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.790
So, Dad, any chance you can come
to my lacrosse tournament?

22:48.790 --> 22:51.920
Oh, it's just, with you
out of the country,

22:51.920 --> 22:54.250
it's been a while
since I saw you.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.250
To be honest,
it's been tough here.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.330
Yeah, you're right.

22:59.330 --> 23:00.710
I'm sure I'll start
meeting people.

23:02.460 --> 23:05.120
Okay. I get it, Dad.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.330
Maybe next time.

23:12.380 --> 23:15.710
♪ Feels like the sky
Is falling ♪

23:17.500 --> 23:18.920
Hey, Aidan.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.500
We're having game night.
Want to join?

23:24.500 --> 23:26.540
Seriously?

23:28.250 --> 23:30.750
Seriously.
