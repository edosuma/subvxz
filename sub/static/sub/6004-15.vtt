00:02.508 --> 00:04.219
Quill, I'm happy you found your father,

00:04.244 --> 00:07.600
even happier you turned out
to be a prince of Spartax.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.284
But these uniforms are a deal breaker.

00:10.309 --> 00:13.202
Seriously, Gamora? 'Cause I don't
have a problem with mine.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.359
Designed it myself.

00:14.493 --> 00:17.524
I will only wear the pants,
although I do not like them.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.519
Drax is right. This ain't us.

00:20.545 --> 00:23.899
Deep down we're outlaws, even
when we're doing good stuff.

00:23.933 --> 00:26.320
True, Rocket, but as members
of the Imperial Guard,

00:26.345 --> 00:29.441
you can access the Spartax
intelligence network.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.163
With such knowledge,

00:31.198 --> 00:34.112
we could locate Ronan,
and exact my revenge!

00:34.137 --> 00:36.054
Peter, you're running late.

00:36.603 --> 00:41.207
My son must make a strong first
impression with the Galactic Council.

00:42.476 --> 00:46.010
Uh, this is like,
you know, a royal thing.

00:46.035 --> 00:49.139
Super boring. You guys just 
hang loose here.

00:50.387 --> 00:52.373
So, it's not just me, right?

00:52.398 --> 00:54.854
This whole prince thing
is going to his head?

00:56.256 --> 00:57.766
J'Son of Spartax,

00:57.798 --> 01:00.781
the son of Odin does not
like to be kept waiting.

01:00.806 --> 01:02.063
My apologies, Thor.

01:02.088 --> 01:07.398
Let me begin by introducing to the Council
my son, Peter, the new Prince of Spartax.

01:07.619 --> 01:09.864
Love the look, bro. Totally metal.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.209
Yes. Peter, this is Thor of Asgard.

01:13.537 --> 01:15.924
You already know Nova Prime of Xandar.

01:15.949 --> 01:18.282
This is the Grand
Commissioner of Rigel.

01:18.307 --> 01:19.297
Hmm.

01:19.322 --> 01:22.324
And finally, the Kree Supreme 
Intelligence.

01:22.349 --> 01:25.504
Whoa, dude! You're like a
giant floating booger.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.590
Seriously.

01:28.747 --> 01:30.290
Excuse me for just one moment.

01:30.315 --> 01:33.220
- Do not say a word until I get back.
- I am Groot!

01:33.853 --> 01:36.173
What is going on out here?

01:36.198 --> 01:39.779
Hello! Spartax Imperial Guard
coming through.

01:39.804 --> 01:42.202
We need to see Peter immediately.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.061
Impossible. We're in the middle of...

01:44.086 --> 01:46.091
Stand back, Rigellian dog!

01:47.274 --> 01:50.141
Hey, Dad. Don't get mad,

01:50.166 --> 01:54.165
but I think I might have
started a teensy little war.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.191
Sync and corrections by <font color="#808040">masaca</font>
- addic7ed.com -

02:06.378 --> 02:07.934
This means war!

02:07.959 --> 02:10.144
So be it, Kree tyrant.

02:10.169 --> 02:13.294
Thor of Asgard forbids
violence in this chamber.

02:19.136 --> 02:20.944
You dare?

02:21.091 --> 02:23.086
Yes, I do.

02:27.483 --> 02:29.613
What did you do this time?

02:29.966 --> 02:30.742
Nothing!

02:30.767 --> 02:31.780
Ow!

02:32.029 --> 02:37.307
You call giving away a vast parcel
of the Kree Empire nothing?

02:37.340 --> 02:40.142
Look, when I said you could
"have" the Borlon sector,

02:40.176 --> 02:41.459
it was just a figure of speech.

02:41.484 --> 02:43.344
I mean, seriously, the place is a pit!

02:43.369 --> 02:45.489
How was I supposed to know
it was a Kree colony?

02:46.102 --> 02:49.720
Spartax dog. Does
your word mean nothing?

02:51.851 --> 02:53.164
Ow! What...

02:53.189 --> 02:54.507
Cut that...

02:54.532 --> 02:55.928
Ah! That hurts!

02:59.129 --> 03:01.018
What treachery is this?

03:01.131 --> 03:04.438
Although Quill punching himself 
is hilarious,

03:04.463 --> 03:08.703
I'm gonna have to ask you to cut it
out, or my friend here will squeeze.

03:10.744 --> 03:12.030
Very well.

03:12.242 --> 03:14.243
Well, one more couldn't hurt.

03:18.905 --> 03:19.755
Ow!

03:22.734 --> 03:26.021
Surely you can see the logic
of preserving peace.

03:26.056 --> 03:29.667
I assure you, reparations will be made.

03:30.093 --> 03:32.961
Very well, J'Son of Spartax.

03:33.229 --> 03:36.727
We will await your reparations.

03:37.058 --> 03:38.788
Thank you. Thank you all.

03:38.822 --> 03:42.958
Guards, if you would escort the Guardian
guards out of the chamber, please.

03:43.173 --> 03:46.035
Yeah, thanks, guys. I think Dad
and I can take it from here.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.895
I want you out of here most of all.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.786
Do you have any idea what I'm going
to have to do to smooth this over?

03:50.834 --> 03:52.770
- But, Dad...
- Just go!

03:52.795 --> 03:55.733
Before you give away the Kree
home world to the Chitauri.

04:01.057 --> 04:03.562
What the heck, guys? You couldn't
wait, like, five minutes?

04:03.784 --> 04:06.328
Hey, you were the one who said
we should go dig up info.

04:06.370 --> 04:09.905
Tell him what you found on the
Spartax spy network, Drax.

04:09.933 --> 04:14.009
Ronan is performing a Kree purification
ritual in an ancient temple.

04:14.086 --> 04:16.870
Ronan only does it once
every celestial cycle.

04:16.896 --> 04:18.690
We may never get this chance again.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.791
But I can't leave now, not after
what happened with the Council.

04:21.906 --> 04:24.449
Dad wants me to go on
some big diplomatic mission.

04:24.462 --> 04:27.895
You want to be a prince,
or you want to be a Guardian?

04:27.949 --> 04:29.603
That's not fair, man.

04:29.685 --> 04:33.355
Can't you guys hold off till I get back?
Like a day and a half, max.

04:33.390 --> 04:36.734
Sounds like you've made your decision.
See you in a few days.

04:40.404 --> 04:42.264
Hey, Dad. Sorry I'm late.

04:42.298 --> 04:45.588
I was talking to my friends,
and... Wow.

04:47.137 --> 04:49.801
Hi. I'm Peter, Prince of Spartax.

04:49.965 --> 04:53.711
Some people call me Star-Lord.
Some call me the gangster of love.

04:53.805 --> 04:56.147
And I will call you
neither of those things.

04:56.383 --> 05:00.559
I am Captain Victoria, Commander
of the Spartax Royal Guard

05:00.584 --> 05:02.901
and daughter of the Emperor J'Son.

05:02.926 --> 05:06.232
- She's your sister, Peter.
- Oh, sister?

05:06.379 --> 05:07.726
Wait, I have a sister?

05:07.751 --> 05:09.908
Yes, Peter, and by Spartax law,

05:09.933 --> 05:12.258
either of you could be
named the next king.

05:12.262 --> 05:14.355
I will keep that in mind, sir.

05:14.521 --> 05:17.989
Oh! Wait till I tell the guys
about my baby sister, Vicky!

05:18.014 --> 05:19.358
Victoria.

05:19.383 --> 05:21.151
Oh, this is so awesome!
You know, oh...

05:21.176 --> 05:22.555
Man, I always wanted a little sis.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.197
Someone who'd look up to me
and I'd look out for her.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.176
Sir, is this really necessary?

05:27.210 --> 05:29.178
I can handle this mission solo.

05:29.212 --> 05:33.331
You will escort a refinery asteroid
to the Kree Supreme Intelligence.

05:33.618 --> 05:37.557
A gift to settle a certain 
border dispute.

05:37.927 --> 05:40.511
The asteroid will be delivered
as promised, Emperor.

05:40.536 --> 05:43.849
Yeah, well, there's nothing me
and my baby sis can't handle.

05:43.998 --> 05:46.398
Oh! Okay, you got me.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.445
No, seriously, you can
let go now. Ow, ow!

05:50.567 --> 05:53.747
Remember, this temple is
supposed to be a place of peace.

05:53.772 --> 05:56.980
There are safeguards against anyone
bringing in weapons of any kind.

05:57.639 --> 05:59.280
Any kind.

06:03.374 --> 06:05.088
Yeah. Oh, forgot about that one.

06:05.956 --> 06:07.825
I feel so naked.

06:08.218 --> 06:11.879
- Well, that's all of 'em.
- Yeah.

06:15.191 --> 06:18.425
Do you ever get tired
of sucking the joy out of life?

06:21.637 --> 06:24.401
You would interrupt
my meditation?

06:24.681 --> 06:28.146
You're going to pay for your
crimes against the galaxy, Ronan.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.368
And how do you intend
to exact that payment?

06:31.393 --> 06:32.985
You have no weapons.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.011
Neither do you, smart guy.

06:35.036 --> 06:38.706
This temple is a weapon.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.788
Isn't that right, Nebula?

06:43.000 --> 06:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:51.488 --> 06:53.419
Guardians of the Galaxy,

06:53.623 --> 06:56.303
prepare to be cleansed!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.507
I do not fear the light.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.039
Oh, yeah? Ever
get hit by a laser beam?

07:04.073 --> 07:06.592
More like dozens of laser beams.

07:09.101 --> 07:10.557
I am Groot!

07:15.045 --> 07:16.909
We've got to take out those beams.

07:27.468 --> 07:28.827
That was not helpful.

07:32.469 --> 07:33.539
Ya think?

07:33.564 --> 07:36.752
Drax the Destroyer does 
not think, he acts.

07:36.777 --> 07:42.060
I only regret that Star-Lord is not
here to share in your cleansing.

07:48.952 --> 07:51.644
Ronan, we just
received confirmation.

07:51.755 --> 07:54.985
Quill is delivering a refinery
asteroid to Kree space.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.464
A refinery? Really.

07:57.776 --> 07:59.995
Then I may yet have use for these

08:00.029 --> 08:02.522
"Guardians of the Galaxy."

08:14.678 --> 08:18.545
Greetments, Captain Victoria.
Welcome be to asteroid.

08:18.570 --> 08:20.758
I am foreman, L'Rik.

08:21.178 --> 08:24.404
Prince Peter of Spartax,
also known as Star...

08:25.600 --> 08:26.346
Hey!

08:26.553 --> 08:28.482
No flirting with my baby sis.

08:29.108 --> 08:32.403
One, I thought I made it clear
that I don't need your protection.

08:32.428 --> 08:36.015
Two, that is how commoners
greet Spartax royalty.

08:36.131 --> 08:41.147
Which you would know if you
were Spartax, Earth man.

08:42.494 --> 08:44.585
This the smelting unit be.

08:44.665 --> 08:47.083
Mined ore separated here.

08:47.383 --> 08:50.012
We have an old saying
about smelting on my planet.

08:50.046 --> 08:53.882
It goes, "Whoever smelt it,
dealt it."

08:54.780 --> 08:55.871
What?

08:57.020 --> 08:59.174
This the foundry be.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.218
Metals here we cast for shipping.

09:02.348 --> 09:04.023
Man, the heat in here is brutal.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.195
You guys must be paid well, huh?

09:06.604 --> 09:09.698
They are servants of
the Spartax Empire, Peter.

09:09.839 --> 09:11.585
They do not get paid.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.037
So they're forced to work like this?
Wow. That is not cool.

09:16.062 --> 09:17.195
Maybe we should do something about...

09:17.220 --> 09:19.521
This is the heir
to the throne of Spartax?

09:19.546 --> 09:21.058
A childish buffoon?

09:21.413 --> 09:23.733
You have no right
to show up out of nowhere

09:23.758 --> 09:25.892
and threaten my rightful inheritance.

09:26.049 --> 09:29.066
You are not worthy
of the title of Star-Lord.

09:32.311 --> 09:35.958
Star-Lord?
What means Star-Lord?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.615
Oh, there was this prophecy
that a Star-Lord would come

09:38.640 --> 09:41.260
and free the oppressed, but it
turned out to be totally fake.

09:41.701 --> 09:43.716
To free the oppressed will be?

09:43.866 --> 09:45.968
Who to free the oppressed will be?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.547
Star-Lord. Star-Lord to free us will be.

09:49.572 --> 09:54.392
Star-Lord! Star-Lord!

09:54.417 --> 09:56.831
<i>This is
Kree Flagship Cerebelia.</i>

09:56.856 --> 09:59.045
<i>We have arrived at rendezvous point.</i>

09:59.070 --> 10:01.341
Kree flagship acknowledged be.

10:01.366 --> 10:04.737
Refinery asteroid in 47 minutes arrive.

10:06.107 --> 10:06.937
Uh...

10:07.418 --> 10:10.909
Don't get mad, but I think I might have
started a teensy little rebellion.

10:11.676 --> 10:14.926
No work until miner's life
better to be.

10:14.951 --> 10:16.819
<i>On strike! On strike!</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:17.966
Seal that door!

10:18.001 --> 10:20.102
We do not want that mob
getting in here.

10:20.136 --> 10:21.837
Isn't that a little overkill?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.507
I mean, they kind of have a point.

10:23.532 --> 10:27.930
I have seen this happen before,
and it always turns violent.

10:28.423 --> 10:30.112
Ship approaching be.

10:30.146 --> 10:32.888
- Outlaw ship.
- As I suspected,

10:32.913 --> 10:35.176
they have already
called in reinforcements.

10:36.694 --> 10:38.604
Oh, I know that ship. That's my ship.

10:41.624 --> 10:43.908
Hey! You guys came back for me.

10:43.933 --> 10:47.581
<i>Yeah, the, uh, Ronan thing turned
out to be a bust, so, uh...</i>

10:48.264 --> 10:51.783
<i>Here we are.
You gonna let us land, or...</i>

10:52.287 --> 10:54.780
Oh, yeah, open the hangar
doors and let my buddies in.

10:55.513 --> 10:59.086
But asteroid locked down be.

10:59.635 --> 11:03.080
I, Prince Peter of Spartax
officially, royally,

11:03.105 --> 11:05.163
order you to let my friends in.

11:09.717 --> 11:11.424
Well done, vermin.

11:11.961 --> 11:17.220
Now land us safely inside the hangar,
and I may dispatch you last.

11:26.169 --> 11:30.172
Okay, just ease her
down nice and quiet and casual

11:30.206 --> 11:33.075
so no one notices anything until now!

11:42.085 --> 11:44.332
Leave them.
They've served their purpose.

11:44.476 --> 11:49.131
- Quill, Ronan is on the asteroid.
<i>- Ronan? What's he doing here?</i>

11:49.162 --> 11:52.716
Besides trying to kill us? Couldn't
say, but I'm sure it ain't good!

11:53.826 --> 11:56.634
Bad man's here coming
to control room.

11:56.659 --> 11:59.103
But woman headed for smelting unit be.

11:59.128 --> 12:02.476
- Forget her, he's the dangerous one.
- No, no!

12:02.501 --> 12:06.829
If woman tricks safety
protocols, reactors unstable be!

12:06.854 --> 12:09.442
Catalyst melt, fuel ignite.

12:09.579 --> 12:11.847
And everything goes boom.
Got it.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.849
Guys, don't worry about Ronan.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.631
The important thing
is to get to the smelting unit

12:15.656 --> 12:19.123
and stop Nebula from doing anything.
Just stop her!

12:19.148 --> 12:20.849
<i>On strike! On str...</i>

12:22.700 --> 12:25.817
Get ready. Ronan is right outside.

12:26.083 --> 12:29.898
Worry not, this
cross-alloyed ferronite be.

12:29.932 --> 12:32.067
Take power of battle cruis...

12:37.940 --> 12:40.486
As Captain of the Spartax Royal Guard,

12:40.511 --> 12:43.152
I order you to leave this facility.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.906
Trust me, Vicky. This guy's
tougher than he looks.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.779
For the last time,
I do not need your protection.

12:48.818 --> 12:50.779
And do not call me Vicky!

12:54.979 --> 12:57.787
Whoa. You go, baby sis!

13:02.563 --> 13:04.662
Hey, that's my sister!

13:08.037 --> 13:12.390
Now, if you royal
Spartax brats are finished,

13:12.529 --> 13:16.345
I, Ronan the Accuser, pronounce sentence.

13:16.646 --> 13:20.307
This refinery will be delivered
to the Supreme Intelligence

13:20.332 --> 13:24.307
after Nebula has rigged it to explode.

13:24.503 --> 13:28.023
Why would a Kree accuser
destroy his own leader?

13:28.057 --> 13:33.533
The Supreme Intelligence has
proven unworthy to lead my people.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.802
In one glorious explosion,

13:36.827 --> 13:42.122
I will free my people from the 
so-called Supreme Intelligence

13:42.147 --> 13:45.748
and free myself from the 
constant interference

13:45.773 --> 13:48.538
of the Guardians of the Galaxy!

13:48.945 --> 13:50.743
Unless we stop you, again.

13:50.768 --> 13:52.002
Not possible.

13:52.114 --> 13:56.009
Without the navigation
and communication systems,

13:59.121 --> 14:01.592
you can neither change course,

14:01.958 --> 14:06.402
nor warn the Kree fleet, nor escape.

14:06.549 --> 14:11.906
The Kree will think that the refinery
crew evacuated before the explosion

14:11.931 --> 14:18.110
<i>and take it as proof that the Spartax
intentionally sabotaged the refinery.</i>

14:18.135 --> 14:21.859
<i>Kree will declare war on Spartax,</i>

14:21.978 --> 14:27.916
and I shall lead my people
to glorious victory.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.187
Nebula!

14:39.795 --> 14:41.929
Too late, sister.

14:42.031 --> 14:46.478
This asteroid is now a flying bomb
on a one-way collision course.

14:46.769 --> 14:47.902
But don't worry.

14:47.937 --> 14:51.900
There's still plenty of
time to settle old scores.

15:00.077 --> 15:03.946
Oh, flarg! Ronan still has our
weapons locked down on the <i>Milano.</i>

15:04.460 --> 15:06.225
You and Groot take care of the bomb.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.348
Drax, get those miners out of here.

15:08.373 --> 15:09.736
I'll handle Nebula.

15:10.730 --> 15:13.497
You must leave this place, now!

15:29.578 --> 15:31.903
Ah, my ship has arrived.

15:31.953 --> 15:35.517
I was going to let you burn
with your friends, Star-Lord,

15:35.551 --> 15:38.655
but I've decided
not to take any chances.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.108
Huh?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.986
I admit, maybe I did need
your help this one time.

15:48.011 --> 15:50.788
But why did you save me?

15:50.813 --> 15:54.883
With me out of the way, you would
be the next king, guaranteed.

15:54.908 --> 15:56.753
You're my baby sis.

15:56.778 --> 15:59.993
Man, you know, people in space
have some messed up families.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.535
Ow!

16:06.854 --> 16:08.725
<i>Time to go, Nebula.</i>

16:14.273 --> 16:16.224
There's nowhere to run, sister.

16:19.295 --> 16:20.307
No!

16:30.945 --> 16:32.876
Goodbye, Gamora.

16:34.663 --> 16:36.671
- I find her irritating.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:36.696 --> 16:40.105
Guys, Ronan's gonna use the asteroid
to blow up the Supreme Intelligence.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.808
Oh, and I've got a baby sister.

16:45.388 --> 16:47.091
You have my condolences.

16:48.557 --> 16:50.258
Ronan will not succeed.

16:50.326 --> 16:52.427
Rocket is defusing the bomb
as we speak.

16:52.461 --> 16:54.496
Update. Ain't no bomb
to defuse.

16:54.530 --> 16:56.364
Neb started a chain reaction.

16:56.399 --> 16:58.664
In about 10 minutes
the smelter goes boom,

16:58.695 --> 17:02.071
<i>sets off those fuel tanks, and
this whole rock goes kablooey!</i>

17:02.405 --> 17:05.988
We can't evacuate the miners.
Ronan's launched all the escape pods!

17:06.242 --> 17:08.084
Hmm. I can't stop
the explosion,

17:08.108 --> 17:11.749
but if we work together maybe I can
point it where it won't hurt nobody.

17:11.858 --> 17:13.042
You can do that?

17:13.068 --> 17:15.069
Lady, blowin' stuff up is an art,

17:15.094 --> 17:17.415
and you are lookin' at a master.

17:22.714 --> 17:26.428
Spartax refinery, we have visual contact.
Please acknowledge.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.222
Feeble Spartaxians cannot
even operate a comm link.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.601
There's a wonder they managed
to build an empire.

17:33.755 --> 17:36.854
<i>All miners report
to the smelting unit immediately,</i>

17:37.014 --> 17:38.755
<i>by order of the Star-Lord.</i>

17:38.874 --> 17:40.508
What is he up to now?

17:40.543 --> 17:42.147
Take the <i>Dark Aster.</i>

17:42.172 --> 17:45.199
I will remain to ensure
all goes as planned.

17:51.387 --> 17:53.037
Okay, here's what we need to do.

17:54.012 --> 17:57.160
<i>Each of you takes a team of miners
to the blast doors I've tagged.</i>

17:57.535 --> 17:59.630
<i>They're programed
to close in an emergency,</i>

17:59.655 --> 18:02.203
<i>but you gotta fix 'em
so they stay open.</i>

18:02.308 --> 18:04.342
Meanwhile, I'm gonna speed things along

18:04.367 --> 18:08.336
so this baby blows before it gets
too close to the Kree fleet.

18:08.371 --> 18:10.505
Quickly, the last door is just ahead.

18:10.539 --> 18:13.912
Whatever you are planning,
you will fail.

18:14.508 --> 18:17.545
Continue with your task.
I will deal with Ronan.

18:25.415 --> 18:27.901
You still seek revenge, Destroyer.

18:28.071 --> 18:31.102
The futility of your quest
must be obvious,

18:31.127 --> 18:35.297
even to one as thick-headed as you.

18:35.464 --> 18:39.420
I do not need to defeat you. I must
merely withstand your attacks.

18:39.753 --> 18:42.259
Then withstand this.

18:57.029 --> 18:57.652
Huh?

19:02.591 --> 19:05.052
<i>When I say Spartax,
you say Star-Lord!</i>

19:05.077 --> 19:06.811
- <i>Spartax!</i>
Star-Lord!

19:06.836 --> 19:08.786
- <i>Spartax!</i>
Star-Lord!

19:12.371 --> 19:13.084
Huh!

19:24.536 --> 19:26.372
I may be a childish buffoon,

19:26.747 --> 19:28.636
but I'm an awesome distraction.

19:30.486 --> 19:33.676
Speaking of which we need to go. Now!

19:35.224 --> 19:36.680
And three,

19:37.091 --> 19:39.394
two, one.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.620
Is this gift some Spartax joke?

19:53.803 --> 19:59.040
If so, my combined Kree intellect
fails to see the humor.

20:09.325 --> 20:12.293
No. No!

20:16.265 --> 20:16.851
Ahhh!

20:32.581 --> 20:35.617
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.585
I did not think it was possible.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.484
And it wouldn't have been
without all these miners' help.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.781
Yes, I think I may have been wrong...

20:43.945 --> 20:44.971
Star-Lord!

20:44.996 --> 20:46.953
...about a lot of things.

20:50.828 --> 20:53.301
Okay, so we go in,
explain to the blobby dude

20:53.335 --> 20:55.969
that we blew up his gift to save
his life, and leave as heroes.

20:55.994 --> 21:01.140
I am also going to ask Father to grant
the miners full Spartax citizenship.

21:01.377 --> 21:04.727
I figure he cannot say no
in front of the Council.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.481
You sure you don't want us with you

21:06.522 --> 21:09.693
for moral support or backup?

21:09.804 --> 21:14.188
I think me and Vicky... I mean,
Captain Victoria can handle this.

21:15.518 --> 21:18.201
I can protect my big bro.

21:18.721 --> 21:20.785
<i>Beings of the Galactic Council,</i>

21:20.810 --> 21:23.949
<i>my brother, the prince,
has something to say.</i>

21:25.766 --> 21:27.482
You dare
to make an attempt on my life?

21:27.507 --> 21:29.641
Okay, don't get mad.
