WEBVTT

00:12.094 --> 00:13.968
Yeah!

00:16.265 --> 00:18.092
- Take it easy.
- Come on!

00:20.603 --> 00:23.176
Dude, did you hear the guy
at the hotel this morning?

00:23.272 --> 00:24.980
They spotted mako sharks.

00:25.566 --> 00:28.602
Please.
They go after seals, not this hard body.

00:28.694 --> 00:31.019
Brad, this isn't a joke.

00:31.197 --> 00:35.360
The odds of a shark attack
against humans is like 10,000 to 1.

00:35.451 --> 00:37.657
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.412
I don't know, bro.

00:40.498 --> 00:44.163
Fine.
You girls stay up here where it's safe,

00:44.251 --> 00:47.751
I'm gonna get up close and personal
with the coral reef.

02:02.129 --> 02:04.834
The body was in the water
less than 24 hours.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.379
NAS Key West tagged and bagged
and shipped it over.

02:07.468 --> 02:09.045
We have an I. D?

02:09.136 --> 02:12.885
Seaman Russell MacDonald. Nineteen.

02:12.973 --> 02:14.800
Assigned to the USS Foster.

02:14.892 --> 02:17.513
- Destroyer. Spruance class.
- Hey, look at that!

02:17.603 --> 02:19.726
New kid on the block's
been doing her homework.

02:19.814 --> 02:23.348
USS Foster left
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station

02:23.442 --> 02:25.814
two days ago en route to Norfolk.

02:27.446 --> 02:29.238
This is her position now.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.983
The body was found here,
in the Bahamas.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.358
- Roosevelt Roads?
- Yeah.

02:33.452 --> 02:35.528
- That's Puerto Rico.
- Yeah.

02:36.664 --> 02:39.202
- I love Puerto Rico.
- I'm glad.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.536
No, boss, you don't understand.

02:40.626 --> 02:43.876
- I love Puerto Rico!
- You been there a lot?

02:43.963 --> 02:46.288
No! No, that's just it.
I've never been there!

02:46.382 --> 02:50.510
I mean, I'm so wanting to go!
Ever since I was a kid, I was so

02:51.178 --> 02:52.507
wanting. Sorry.

02:52.596 --> 02:55.218
- I just always...
- Wanted to be there.

02:56.016 --> 02:57.261
Yeah.

02:58.519 --> 03:01.473
Sometime night before last,
Seaman MacDonald went overboard.

03:01.564 --> 03:02.844
Anyone see or hear anything?

03:02.940 --> 03:05.645
No. Didn't know he was missing
till he failed to report for duty.

03:05.735 --> 03:08.380
- Anything in the medical?
- We'll get all that when we get on board.

03:08.404 --> 03:09.946
Anything else unusual?

03:12.408 --> 03:16.869
- This is exactly how he was found.
- Dress whites? Why?

03:16.954 --> 03:19.196
No one knows.
There were no formal events scheduled.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.532
- The sword?
- Officer's ceremonial.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.084
Our man's enlisted.

03:23.169 --> 03:25.410
Yeah.
Doesn't make much sense, does it?

03:25.504 --> 03:28.078
Here's something else
for the mystery tour.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.712
This so-called ceremonial sword

03:31.385 --> 03:34.090
is sharp enough to slit
someone's throat.

03:34.305 --> 03:35.419
Do you know why they drive

03:35.514 --> 03:38.432
on the left-hand side of the road
in England?

03:40.311 --> 03:42.138
Dates back to medieval times.

03:42.229 --> 03:45.230
Most people were,
and still are, right-handed.

03:45.441 --> 03:50.269
It allowed them to slash at one another
when passing on horseback.

03:52.990 --> 03:57.403
Why, you might ask,
doesn't this hold true

03:57.495 --> 03:59.368
for the rest of Europe?

03:59.789 --> 04:04.118
- Why the chain on the waist?
- These...

04:10.049 --> 04:13.133
These were attached to it,
each 25 pounds.

04:13.302 --> 04:16.801
Now whether he put them on himself
or someone did it for him,

04:16.889 --> 04:19.427
that much weight sent him down fast.

04:19.934 --> 04:23.978
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll get
our poor seaman out of his wet clothes.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.518
You're not gonna say,
"And into a dry martini," are you?

04:26.607 --> 04:27.686
No.

04:28.692 --> 04:32.441
No, we'll save that for later,
for me, I'm afraid.

04:34.949 --> 04:37.025
The seaman's local.
Address is in the file.

04:37.117 --> 04:40.486
You don't have to do the dirty deed.
CACO already notified next of kin.

04:40.579 --> 04:41.777
Why me, boss?

04:41.872 --> 04:44.079
Wouldn't a woman
be more sympathetic?

04:44.166 --> 04:48.116
- That's why Kate is going with you.
- I'm sure Tony can handle it alone.

04:48.212 --> 04:50.785
When did an order turn into a debate?

04:59.431 --> 05:03.097
- I hate this. I really do.
- Is it gonna be that tough?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.103
You have no idea.

05:06.397 --> 05:07.808
No, I don't.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.106
- Tony?
- Yeah?

05:17.867 --> 05:19.361
Take a breath.

05:20.786 --> 05:22.577
Think of Puerto Rico.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.283
Good idea.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.540
According to what's been reported,

05:28.627 --> 05:32.292
Russell didn't seem to have
a lot of friends on the destroyer.

05:32.381 --> 05:35.715
No, he had many friends on the ship.

05:36.635 --> 05:40.218
- He told me so in his letters.
- Was this sword Russell's?

05:41.098 --> 05:43.969
It was my husband's. He was Scottish.

05:44.643 --> 05:47.265
He served in
The Black Watch regiment.

05:48.564 --> 05:51.019
Russell's file says he's deceased.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.729
He was killed in a car accident
when Russell was 12.

05:56.614 --> 05:58.523
Russell was devastated.

05:59.742 --> 06:03.158
Did Russell seem particularly obsessed
with the sword?

06:04.747 --> 06:06.739
I don't understand why you...

06:06.832 --> 06:09.453
A similar weapon was found with the...

06:10.294 --> 06:11.788
Near Russell.

06:12.296 --> 06:15.166
Mrs MacDonald, in Russell's letters

06:15.257 --> 06:18.792
did he seem, you know,
down or depressed?

06:20.930 --> 06:22.803
Russell had his quirks.

06:23.682 --> 06:27.134
But a mother knows things
about her son.

06:27.686 --> 06:30.473
He would not have killed himself.

06:33.943 --> 06:35.602
It's a mortal sin.

06:42.743 --> 06:44.387
Are these interviews
always that difficult?

06:44.411 --> 06:46.534
- I guess.
- You guess?

06:46.622 --> 06:48.661
I've never interviewed
a victim's mother before.

06:48.749 --> 06:50.644
Well, I thought you'd been
a Baltimore homicide cop.

06:50.668 --> 06:52.508
I always had someone else
interview the mother.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.662
- This was your first?
- Yeah.

06:55.172 --> 06:57.710
Why did you assume I'd have no idea
how bad it was gonna be?

06:57.800 --> 07:01.334
- I didn't think you would.
- That is so presumptuous!

07:01.553 --> 07:03.048
- Kate?
- What?

07:03.597 --> 07:04.842
Breathe.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.811
The commander's on a call
with LANT fleet, sir.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.775
He'll catch up with you
as soon as he can.

07:17.861 --> 07:19.404
We appreciate it, Master Chief.

07:19.488 --> 07:21.777
Did you have any contact
with Seaman MacDonald?

07:21.865 --> 07:24.819
Can't say I did, sir.
Kept pretty much to himself.

07:24.910 --> 07:28.361
Seems to be the general consensus
or the party line.

07:29.707 --> 07:32.198
We got you set up in the XO's quarters.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.866
It's small, but it's private and secure.

07:35.129 --> 07:37.038
I'm sure it'll be fine.

07:39.049 --> 07:40.212
Enter.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.584
Lieutenant Commander Robbins,
Agent Gibbs.

07:43.679 --> 07:46.466
- Appreciate you giving up your...
- Not a problem.

07:46.557 --> 07:50.720
NCIS is always welcome aboard, sir.
You can expect excellent cooperation.

07:50.811 --> 07:52.471
I appreciate that, Master Chief.

07:52.563 --> 07:55.398
- If you need anything...
- I won't hesitate.

07:58.902 --> 08:00.942
Now, why didn't that sound sincere?

08:01.030 --> 08:03.603
You get used to it.
They either stonewall or kiss ass.

08:03.699 --> 08:06.190
To them,
we're the Internal Affairs of the navy.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.823
- So, basically, they hate us.
- No.

08:09.705 --> 08:10.819
Pretty much.

08:10.914 --> 08:13.666
Set up the laptop
and establish a feed from NCIS.

08:13.751 --> 08:15.079
I'm on it.

08:16.754 --> 08:20.205
We're not all sleeping here, are we?
Together?

08:23.218 --> 08:24.962
I'll take the couch.

08:28.057 --> 08:30.678
- Afternoon, gentlemen.
- Afternoon, sir.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.746
Okay, let's dispense with the small talk.

08:32.770 --> 08:36.020
Which one is his bunk,
Petty Officer Carnahan?

08:36.106 --> 08:38.977
- Below mine, sir.
- Thank you, Petty Officer.

08:39.193 --> 08:41.433
- You knew MacDonald?
- Not well.

08:41.653 --> 08:44.857
- He pretty much kept to himself.
- Kept to himself.

08:45.157 --> 08:49.866
He like to listen to music? Like to read?

08:49.953 --> 08:51.329
I really didn't notice, sir.

08:51.413 --> 08:55.162
Your bunk is right above his,
but you didn't notice?

08:55.793 --> 08:57.251
I'm a private kind of person.

08:57.336 --> 09:00.787
Well, if you had to venture a wild guess,
Carnahan,

09:01.423 --> 09:03.831
what do you think
MacDonald liked to do?

09:04.802 --> 09:06.675
Spend his life at work.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.587
Computers run the weapons systems,
the radar, the sonar.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.618
We're the backbone of the ship here,
Agent DiNozzo.

09:11.642 --> 09:13.578
The brightest of the brightest
under your command.

09:13.602 --> 09:14.717
I like to think so.

09:14.812 --> 09:16.685
Where was Seaman MacDonald
in the food chain?

09:16.772 --> 09:18.646
- He was good.
- How good?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.335
That depends on what
you're comparing him to.

09:20.359 --> 09:21.734
All right, compared to you.

09:21.819 --> 09:24.855
I trained at MIT, MacDonald
was a year out of high school.

09:24.947 --> 09:28.066
The best IT guy in our office is 22.
Harvard.

09:28.158 --> 09:31.444
When he gets stuck,
he calls his 14-year-old nephew.

09:31.703 --> 09:34.539
- MacDonald was very good.
- How very?

09:35.124 --> 09:37.615
When he was focused,
better than anyone here.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.204
Including you?

09:40.379 --> 09:43.333
- Including me.
- Had he been focused lately?

09:44.466 --> 09:48.962
- No. Hadn't been for a long time.
- You think he offed himself, Lieutenant?

09:50.389 --> 09:51.883
It's possible.

09:52.891 --> 09:56.723
He was troubled. There was definitely
something bothering him.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.971
He was having a hard time
adjusting to ship life.

10:02.067 --> 10:05.518
- I suggested he get into counselling.
- Was he receptive?

10:05.737 --> 10:08.573
No, ma'am.
He just wanted to talk to me.

10:08.866 --> 10:12.566
- What were his issues?
- I wouldn't get into them.

10:12.995 --> 10:15.568
It was obvious that Seaman MacDonald
was disturbed,

10:15.664 --> 10:17.621
but I wasn't qualified, ma'am.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.285
But you did talk to him.

10:19.376 --> 10:22.496
As his medical corpsman,
not his psychologist.

10:25.299 --> 10:28.502
All I know is that he had
this mysterious friend.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.760
I mean, he was from here,
but he wasn't here.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.090
It didn't make any sense.

10:34.474 --> 10:37.974
But he seemed obsessed with him.

10:38.854 --> 10:43.183
Do you think that Russell MacDonald
was capable of taking his own life?

10:44.735 --> 10:46.277
Off the record.

10:47.321 --> 10:48.815
Definitely not!

11:05.839 --> 11:07.168
So, here's what we got.

11:07.257 --> 11:09.546
A dead kid wearing
dress whites for no reason,

11:09.635 --> 11:12.355
with a sword he shouldn't have on,
which is not supposed to be sharp,

11:12.429 --> 11:15.002
at the bottom of the ocean,
with weights on.

11:15.098 --> 11:17.340
He was a brilliant
but troubled computer tech

11:17.434 --> 11:19.676
who lived at work,
and had a mysterious friend.

11:19.770 --> 11:22.605
Okay, so, given the circumstances,
probably not an accidental death.

11:22.689 --> 11:24.598
So, suicide or murder?

11:24.691 --> 11:26.483
The CO suggests
he could have killed himself.

11:26.568 --> 11:28.561
The corpsman he confided in
and his mother

11:28.654 --> 11:29.797
are adamant he never would have.

11:29.821 --> 11:32.443
All right. Something else to consider.

11:32.532 --> 11:35.070
I found this
in Seaman MacDonald's rack.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.041
You know,
that razor-sharp sword he was wearing?

11:37.079 --> 11:39.700
He was teaching himself how to use it.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.161
We found a couple more things
on MacDonald's body.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.916
He was wearing this around his neck.

11:57.208 --> 12:00.125
It's just your average
St Christopher medal.

12:00.336 --> 12:03.871
But here's what's really odd.
He had this in his pocket.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.877
My guess is
it's some sort of character charter

12:07.968 --> 12:09.427
for a fantasy game.

12:09.553 --> 12:10.929
What kind of game?

12:11.013 --> 12:12.721
It looks like an MMORPG.

12:12.807 --> 12:14.883
- MM. What?
- MMORPG.

12:15.476 --> 12:17.848
It's a massive multiplayer
online role-playing game.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.217
They're huge on the Internet.

12:19.313 --> 12:21.353
And a character charter would be what?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.848
It's like a character's manifesto.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.481
His goals, moral stance, creed.

12:26.904 --> 12:28.019
You're kidding me.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.071
No, they really get into this stuff.

12:30.157 --> 12:32.695
There can be, like,
thousands of players on one site alone.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.185
Well, it's comforting to know that.

12:34.245 --> 12:37.495
Russell's computer skills were being
put to good use on $1 billion ship.

12:37.581 --> 12:39.241
He's a computer geek?

12:39.333 --> 12:42.417
Yeah, worked in
the Combat Information Centre.

12:42.503 --> 12:44.994
That is a perfect gig for a power gamer.

12:45.339 --> 12:49.337
I mean, he was working on combat,
it was just more like the medieval kind.

12:49.427 --> 12:54.005
- Abby, are games like this violent?
- Well, there's poisonings, thieveries,

12:54.098 --> 12:57.265
stabbings, decapitations,
the occasional garrotte.

12:57.351 --> 12:58.976
I'd say that's violent.

12:59.061 --> 13:00.580
What should we look for
on his hard drive?

13:00.604 --> 13:03.226
If he's any good,
he won't leave any footprints.

13:03.315 --> 13:06.269
So where's the evidence,
if there is evidence?

13:06.736 --> 13:08.064
Cyberspace.

13:08.195 --> 13:09.606
Theoretically, yeah.

13:09.697 --> 13:10.859
Can you find it?

13:10.948 --> 13:12.905
Maybe. These gaming sites are run

13:12.992 --> 13:15.993
by anonymous server clients
in every country on the planet.

13:16.078 --> 13:18.534
MacDonald's file didn't show
any foreign language skills,

13:18.622 --> 13:20.703
you're probably looking
for something run in English.

13:20.750 --> 13:21.948
That's good.

13:22.042 --> 13:24.913
The machines are state-of-the-art.
Think government excess.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.704
Well, that'll eliminate the weekenders,
and the lo-fi guys.

13:28.799 --> 13:30.626
I mean, I'll give it a shot, you know.

13:30.718 --> 13:31.797
The sword.

13:31.886 --> 13:33.048
Yeah. What about it?

13:33.137 --> 13:36.387
The blade has nicks in it.
Contact with hard metal.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.051
Another sword?

13:38.142 --> 13:41.392
- It's possible.
- Two sailors playing with sharp swords.

13:41.479 --> 13:44.266
Once in a while you might miss.
I'm on it.

13:44.398 --> 13:48.562
Abby, have fun with your MMROPG.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.279
What?

13:55.367 --> 13:57.823
- MMORPG.
- Thank you.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.406
You're welcome.

14:00.539 --> 14:03.113
- Can I talk to Ducky now?
- Yeah.

14:07.004 --> 14:08.249
You might wanna warn us about

14:08.339 --> 14:10.047
what you're working on after lunch,
Ducky.

14:10.132 --> 14:13.548
Yes, I suppose gazing directly
into an exposed digestive system

14:13.636 --> 14:15.509
doesn't aid the actual process.

14:15.596 --> 14:17.339
Not after the meal we just had.

14:17.431 --> 14:21.559
Yes, I'm sorry about that, my friend,
but sometimes gaining valuable insight

14:21.644 --> 14:24.217
requires suffering small indignities.

14:24.438 --> 14:27.522
I recall one case, a young woman,
not much older than yourself.

14:27.608 --> 14:29.399
She ingested
a small piece of jewellery...

14:29.485 --> 14:30.599
Ducky?

14:30.694 --> 14:32.319
- Yes?
- What have we got?

14:33.823 --> 14:35.482
Anoxia,

14:35.574 --> 14:38.860
sea water in the stomach,
foam in the trachea.

14:38.953 --> 14:42.369
- Classic death by drowning.
- A slight haemorrhaging of the inner ear

14:42.456 --> 14:45.374
possibly caused
by this rapid shift in pressure.

14:45.459 --> 14:46.740
Because he sank so fast.

14:46.836 --> 14:48.034
That's correct.

14:48.128 --> 14:51.213
Then here we have dirt.

14:52.132 --> 14:56.462
Yes, his fingers grabbed whatever
he was touching when he succumbed.

14:57.054 --> 14:59.627
There's a good chance
Abby will deduce

14:59.807 --> 15:02.298
the dirt came from the ocean floor.

15:02.601 --> 15:06.101
- Which means?
- That Seaman MacDonald was alive

15:06.605 --> 15:08.645
when he went into the sea.

15:10.776 --> 15:14.062
Stainless steel blade,
acid-edged and hand polished.

15:14.154 --> 15:17.689
The fittings, guard, and pommel
are 24 carat gold plated.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.285
As late as the 1800s,
a sword like this would have been used

15:21.370 --> 15:23.778
to defend against an enemy
trying to board a ship.

15:23.873 --> 15:27.787
Only the blade would have been
sharp enough to take a man's limb off.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.498
I always liked pirate movies. Didn't you?

15:30.588 --> 15:31.702
Not really.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.798
Of course, today
it wouldn't stand much of a chance

15:33.883 --> 15:36.800
against a 9-mill,
H and K MP5 Parabellum, would it?

15:36.886 --> 15:40.052
- I guess you like gun movies, too?
- I like all weapons, sir.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.760
I can really appreciate that, Ensign.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.139
Are all the officers'
ceremonial swords accounted for?

15:45.227 --> 15:48.394
Yes, sir. I checked with 32 officers,
found 32 swords,

15:48.480 --> 15:50.188
including my beauty.

15:50.274 --> 15:52.114
We're gonna need to take a look
at all of them.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.396
Yes, sir.

15:54.028 --> 15:56.649
So where do you think MacDonald
could have acquired the sword?

15:56.739 --> 15:58.133
The only place that
would have sold them.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.437
The Base Exchange.

15:59.533 --> 16:02.653
- Roosevelt Roads Naval Station?
- Yes, sir.

16:02.745 --> 16:06.279
If a clerk was lax in checking I.D.'s,
he could have bought one as a souvenir.

16:06.373 --> 16:08.781
But he'd have to hide it on board.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.198
Why's that?

16:10.294 --> 16:12.701
Enlisted men aren't allowed
to carry weapons on ship.

16:12.796 --> 16:14.374
That'd be insane.

16:15.466 --> 16:18.087
- We're taking care of you, I trust.
- Very nicely, Skipper.

16:18.177 --> 16:21.712
- I didn't know the boy very well.
- No one did, it seems.

16:21.805 --> 16:24.557
He was doing some maintenance work
on my computer last week.

16:24.642 --> 16:26.385
He seemed to be in a bit of a daze.

16:26.477 --> 16:29.312
So I had a corpsman
administer a drug test.

16:29.563 --> 16:30.642
He was clean.

16:30.731 --> 16:32.807
The toxicology test we gave him
came up negative.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.878
What do you make
of the uniform, the sword and all?

16:34.902 --> 16:36.016
Not sure.

16:36.111 --> 16:38.567
But we think he was involved
in an online fantasy game.

16:38.656 --> 16:40.233
Like an MMORPG?

16:40.741 --> 16:41.820
Yeah.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.371
My children play. A lot.

16:46.288 --> 16:48.495
Well, we think he might have taken it
a step further

16:48.582 --> 16:51.453
and staged real fights
with someone on board.

16:51.627 --> 16:54.379
Onboard? How would that be possible?

16:54.463 --> 16:55.982
Well, Skipper,
I'm sure you know this ship

16:56.006 --> 16:57.525
better than anyone else
under your command.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.960
Inside and out, Agent Gibbs.

16:59.051 --> 17:02.467
So, if you wanted to stage a sword fight
with another shipmate

17:02.554 --> 17:04.346
and not get caught...

17:06.433 --> 17:09.470
Damage Control, in the Machine Shop,
at night.

17:20.239 --> 17:23.987
Damn! King's guards again.

17:24.326 --> 17:27.660
Okay, I'm turning left into the dungeon

17:28.204 --> 17:32.155
and I spy a great staff of power!

17:36.880 --> 17:38.505
Kick their asses!

17:38.590 --> 17:40.710
I've already surpassed the third level
of the fortress

17:40.759 --> 17:43.594
and made it into the dungeon corridor
of the castle's inner stronghold.

17:43.679 --> 17:47.463
After, of course, slaying two gnomes,
a drunken dwarf, and a frenzied ogre.

17:47.558 --> 17:48.838
Of course.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.019
You know,
this reminds me of something.

17:55.607 --> 17:59.688
Actually, I can't think of a thing
it reminds me of.

18:01.864 --> 18:05.564
The night Seaman MacDonald died
there were three laceration injuries.

18:05.659 --> 18:08.364
Two were work-related,
verified by the division officers.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.363
- The other?
- A prank gone wrong,

18:10.456 --> 18:12.033
in front of seven witnesses.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.748
It didn't involve a sword.

18:13.834 --> 18:16.325
Well, there have to be injuries
that don't have witnesses.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.827
All the time, ma'am.
Mostly after a liberty call.

18:18.922 --> 18:21.413
A surprising number of shaving cuts.

18:22.843 --> 18:25.215
Chief, it would be helpful
if I could get some of the files

18:25.304 --> 18:27.095
of any of the questionable lacerations.

18:27.181 --> 18:30.265
- Going back how far, ma'am?
- A couple of months?

18:30.642 --> 18:32.682
I'll need a couple of hours.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.513
I like the symmetry.

18:36.231 --> 18:38.473
MacDonald's mystery friend

18:39.193 --> 18:41.600
did he ever mention being afraid of him?

18:41.695 --> 18:43.937
He only talked about him once.

18:44.114 --> 18:47.448
It was more like Seaman MacDonald
was in awe of him.

18:56.001 --> 19:00.462
- You're a prince, Ducky.
- Is that a safe occupation in this...

19:01.048 --> 19:02.672
What is this game you're playing?

19:02.758 --> 19:04.003
The lmmortals.

19:04.093 --> 19:06.465
And being a prince is pretty safe.

19:06.553 --> 19:08.760
Unless the elf sorceress invades
the king's apartment

19:08.847 --> 19:10.887
and turns you into an ogre.

19:10.974 --> 19:13.133
Whoa! Whoa!
I just dodged a flaming arrow!

19:13.227 --> 19:14.306
Well done.

19:14.394 --> 19:18.606
- I'm almost there, Ducky.
- And where exactly is "there"?

19:18.690 --> 19:21.976
- The innermost stronghold of the castle.
- The keep.

19:22.069 --> 19:25.189
- Yeah, see? You're catching on!
- Not really.

19:26.323 --> 19:29.526
Remember the character charter I found
in the dead seaman's uniform?

19:29.618 --> 19:30.733
The booklet?

19:30.828 --> 19:35.536
The booklet contained his character's
name, "Weylin," and his creed.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.727
I just don't know
if he was playing The lmmortals

19:37.751 --> 19:39.411
or some other online game.

19:39.503 --> 19:42.208
And that's what you're trying to find out?

19:42.297 --> 19:44.705
Yeah, if I can get into the keep,

19:44.800 --> 19:47.836
I can open a log of all characters that
have played The lmmortals.

19:47.928 --> 19:51.379
- What's that coming towards you?
- It's an orc!

19:57.563 --> 19:59.354
I just got dismembered!

19:59.439 --> 20:02.227
Now I have to infiltrate the castle again.

20:02.609 --> 20:04.602
Would this help, my dear?

20:05.195 --> 20:07.069
Oh, yes.

20:18.292 --> 20:22.159
Gibbs, good guess, MacDonald
got his sword at Roosevelt Roads.

20:22.254 --> 20:26.002
If he was sword fighting with someone,
they probably bought it there, too.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.926
- Yeah?
- I found the site MacDonald frequented.

20:29.011 --> 20:31.965
- He was playing his character, Weylin.
- Like the singer?

20:32.055 --> 20:34.807
More like the mystical
half-elf warrior Weylin.

20:34.892 --> 20:36.968
It's W-E-Y-L-I-N.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.219
That charter we found
on MacDonald's body,

20:39.313 --> 20:41.601
it referred to his main rival, Kinvaras.

20:41.690 --> 20:44.062
Their main mode of combat was parle.

20:44.151 --> 20:46.309
- Abby?
- Sword fighting.

20:46.403 --> 20:47.778
And here's the big whoop.

20:48.906 --> 20:50.614
Fine, whoop me.

20:50.699 --> 20:53.985
The guy who plays Kinvaras
logs on from the Foster.

20:54.494 --> 20:56.452
The same ship you're on.

21:12.862 --> 21:14.819
Who would have thought
that Pong would turn to

21:14.906 --> 21:16.945
online role-playing games?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.279
Pong?

21:18.910 --> 21:20.737
Yeah, the first video game.

21:21.621 --> 21:24.824
And what are the odds
of Seaman MacDonald's character...

21:24.916 --> 21:25.947
Weylin.

21:26.125 --> 21:28.616
- Fighting online in...
- The lmmortals.

21:28.711 --> 21:31.416
- Another seaman's character...
- Kinvaras?

21:31.506 --> 21:33.415
And both of them
are on the same destroyer?

21:33.508 --> 21:35.631
About the same as Seaman MacDonald
being found

21:35.718 --> 21:37.780
at the bottom of the sea
with chains around his waist?

21:37.804 --> 21:40.211
Sounds like something that
should happen in the game.

21:40.306 --> 21:43.971
- Beheading is more likely.
- Why do they use such weird names?

21:44.185 --> 21:47.601
When you're a computer geek
invading dungeons and fighting ogres,

21:47.689 --> 21:49.515
Jethro doesn't cut it.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.769
Neither does Tony.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.405
Seaman MacDonald
bought an officer's sword

21:57.490 --> 21:59.150
and was teaching himself how to use it.

21:59.242 --> 22:01.614
I think he found out
who else on board was role-playing...

22:01.703 --> 22:02.782
Kinvaras.

22:02.871 --> 22:05.029
And decided to take it to the next level:
Reality.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.914
But, boss,
if they both had to have swords,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.333
chances are they bought them
at the Navy Exchange in Puerto Rico.

22:10.420 --> 22:13.171
I could helo there, make an undercover
purchase of a sword,

22:13.256 --> 22:16.839
bust the clerk, swap the bust for info on
who bought the swords from the ship.

22:16.926 --> 22:18.237
Could be there and back in 24 hours.

22:18.261 --> 22:20.135
- Six.
- Twelve.

22:20.722 --> 22:23.213
This is not a negotiation, DiNozzo.

22:24.559 --> 22:25.638
Six.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.959
Damn!

23:01.846 --> 23:03.922
This is gonna take a while.

23:21.950 --> 23:24.156
Can I help you, Petty Officer?

23:24.369 --> 23:26.029
What do you think?

23:26.454 --> 23:28.328
I think they look good on you.

23:28.414 --> 23:29.790
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.832
- I'll take them.
- Okay.

23:33.378 --> 23:35.584
Would you like anything else?

23:36.464 --> 23:38.920
How about a naval officer's sword?

23:39.968 --> 23:43.965
- You know I can't sell you that.
- My friend said I could get one here.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.297
Your friend is wrong.
I could get in trouble.

23:46.391 --> 23:49.308
It's not like it's drugs or anything,
it's just a stupid sword.

23:49.394 --> 23:52.763
Well, the navy has these rules, okay?
Take it up with them.

23:53.189 --> 23:54.683
I'll pay extra.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.939
Come on.
I just want to take it home as a souvenir.

23:59.028 --> 24:00.772
Nobody's gonna know.

24:04.075 --> 24:06.992
- $600.
- They retail for $400.

24:07.078 --> 24:08.786
I could lose my job.

24:10.957 --> 24:12.285
$500.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.711
All right. All right. All right.

24:23.302 --> 24:24.382
Thank you.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.176
Now, look, I know you're gonna take this
the wrong way but I'm NCIS.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.593
And you've got some explaining to do.

24:36.733 --> 24:40.315
All I want is some information. Okay?
No, no, that's all I want.

24:47.952 --> 24:50.573
Once you settle down,
we're gonna be just fine.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.074
Hey! Now listen,

24:54.167 --> 24:56.325
you gotta love Puerto Rico.

24:58.212 --> 25:00.205
Hey, look at these marks.

25:09.057 --> 25:10.385
More here.

25:13.895 --> 25:16.730
These are about two sword-lengths
from the cuts in the other one.

25:16.814 --> 25:20.017
MacDonald and Kinvaras were starting
to take their game very seriously.

25:20.109 --> 25:23.810
- We don't know that yet.
- Well, I checked all the officers' swords

25:23.905 --> 25:25.565
and there wasn't a scratch
on any of them.

25:25.656 --> 25:27.982
Abby has not concluded that
the other metal that.

25:28.076 --> 25:30.401
MacDonald's sword
came in contact with

25:30.495 --> 25:31.989
came from another sword.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.238
Then why did you send Tony
to Puerto Rico?

25:34.332 --> 25:37.701
It's called being thorough.
Hunches do not hold up in court.

25:37.794 --> 25:38.914
Well, it's not just a hunch.

25:39.003 --> 25:42.206
Two people stated
that he wasn't prone to suicide.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.382
- Why are you pushing this, Kate?
- Because it makes sense.

25:49.097 --> 25:53.177
- He's Catholic.
- And so are you.

25:53.810 --> 25:57.095
You cannot let personal situations
colour your judgement.

25:57.188 --> 26:00.308
I don't. But you hired me
because of my knowledge

26:00.399 --> 26:01.894
and my experience.

26:01.984 --> 26:04.689
You've never seen how a suicide
can tear up a Catholic family.

26:04.779 --> 26:06.606
They take it very seriously.

26:06.697 --> 26:09.782
Somehow I don't think
this guy's the catechism type.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.694
He was wearing a St Christopher medal

26:11.786 --> 26:12.948
when they found him.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.224
Even the most hardened criminals
wouldn't cross that line.

26:15.248 --> 26:17.240
It's part of the culture.

26:21.754 --> 26:22.917
Yeah. Gibbs.

26:24.507 --> 26:25.622
Hey, it's me.

26:25.716 --> 26:27.756
Hey, your ears must have been burning.

26:27.844 --> 26:30.002
Better not be from the tropical sun.

26:31.055 --> 26:32.218
Here's what I have.

26:33.975 --> 26:36.014
Hang on. The reception's not good here.

26:36.102 --> 26:37.621
Let me see if I can get to a better spot.

26:37.645 --> 26:41.014
It's DiNozzo. I'm gonna go up top,
see if I can get a better signal.

26:55.204 --> 26:58.289
The Base Exchange
was selling swords to enlisted.

26:58.374 --> 27:00.283
One was definitely
to Seaman MacDonald.

27:00.376 --> 27:01.478
There were three other seamen

27:01.502 --> 27:03.080
who illegally bought officer swords.

27:03.171 --> 27:04.748
And I've got their descriptions.

27:04.839 --> 27:06.499
Okay, where are you?

27:06.716 --> 27:11.093
I'm waiting for my helo to arrive.
It's gonna be a couple hours, though.

27:13.264 --> 27:16.016
Hey! What is that?

27:16.225 --> 27:17.506
It's music, Gibbs.

27:17.768 --> 27:19.560
Don't be so paranoid.

27:20.563 --> 27:22.686
You know I'm a professional.

27:33.367 --> 27:36.701
Yeah! This one matches the description
Tony gave us.

27:41.209 --> 27:45.040
The name's not on the list
of suspicious injuries at sick bay.

27:45.546 --> 27:47.040
How many people on this boat?

27:47.131 --> 27:51.343
This ship has 323 enlisted, 32 officers.

27:52.094 --> 27:55.048
You're lucky this
isn't an aircraft carrier.

27:58.309 --> 28:01.014
- What?
- Petty Officer Ronald Zuger

28:01.103 --> 28:03.179
cut his arm on a plate-glass window
last month.

28:03.272 --> 28:05.395
Only there were no glass shards
in the wound.

28:05.483 --> 28:09.148
- Matches the description?
- To a tee. Guess where he works?

28:23.209 --> 28:25.201
Impressive swordsmanship.

28:27.255 --> 28:29.294
Killed anyone else lately?

28:29.465 --> 28:31.873
The last time I looked
there was nothing in the UCMJ

28:31.968 --> 28:34.091
about virtual homicide, sir.

28:34.637 --> 28:37.922
- You're not under arrest.
- Then why am I here, sir?

28:38.099 --> 28:41.633
Well, for starters, there's a little matter
of misappropriation

28:41.727 --> 28:43.222
of government property.

28:43.312 --> 28:46.930
- Everyone in CIC plays online a little.
- Well, here's a flash.

28:47.024 --> 28:48.898
They don't give you guys
top-notch equipment

28:48.985 --> 28:50.587
so you can have
a better gaming experience.

28:50.611 --> 28:54.111
Well, they wouldn't have top-notch
equipment if it weren't for guys like me.

28:54.198 --> 28:56.689
Guys like you and Seaman MacDonald?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.903
Okay, what came first,

29:00.371 --> 29:02.944
the online chicken or the CIC egg?

29:05.293 --> 29:07.285
I didn't know he was on board
for a long time.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.417
Must have been quite a shock.

29:09.505 --> 29:12.292
Actually we had
a pretty good laugh over it.

29:12.383 --> 29:14.210
He's not laughing now.

29:15.303 --> 29:16.465
Is he?

29:23.311 --> 29:24.390
Yes!

29:39.327 --> 29:41.699
- NCIS.
- That's very official.

29:41.787 --> 29:43.910
Gibbs isn't answering his phone.
Where is he?

29:43.998 --> 29:45.658
Having a talk with Kinvaras.

29:45.875 --> 29:49.160
Well, if he's anywhere near
as whacked out as his rival,

29:49.253 --> 29:50.831
tell Gibbs to watch his neck.

29:50.921 --> 29:52.665
You got into MacDonald's diary?

29:52.757 --> 29:53.871
I did.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.173
This guy had diarrhoea of the keyboard.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.071
It's going to take me a while
to get through it.

29:58.095 --> 30:00.467
I'll do it. I want to.

30:01.140 --> 30:02.338
Cool.

30:02.516 --> 30:05.885
Seaman MacDonald saw you
as some sort of authority figure.

30:05.978 --> 30:07.353
I outranked him, sir.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.107
- That's not what I mean.
- I didn't kill him, sir!

30:10.191 --> 30:12.598
Okay. Have you ever killed him?

30:14.695 --> 30:16.106
In the game?

30:16.697 --> 30:17.776
Sure.

30:17.948 --> 30:20.653
Kinvaras has beheaded Weylin
lots of times.

30:20.743 --> 30:22.700
You were better than him.

30:23.412 --> 30:24.823
Lots better.

30:25.373 --> 30:26.915
Pissed him off.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.333
Is that when you decided
to fight for real?

30:29.418 --> 30:32.336
- I never said we fought for real, sir.
- Tony!

30:36.050 --> 30:38.719
I found this hidden in your rack, amigo.

30:40.179 --> 30:43.880
It won't take long for the crime lab
to match up the metals.

30:44.183 --> 30:48.050
Look, it was his idea.
Take the game to the next level.

30:48.145 --> 30:49.826
I thought it was kind of cool at the time!

30:49.855 --> 30:52.062
- Until you got cut.
- Yes, sir.

30:52.608 --> 30:54.601
That frighten you, Zuger?

30:54.735 --> 30:58.187
When you found out that
MacDonald was playing for real?

30:59.698 --> 31:01.905
Kinvaras is never frightened.

31:02.743 --> 31:04.784
And I've never quite known
what Weylin was thinking.

31:04.870 --> 31:08.073
Where were you the night that
MacDonald went overboard?

31:08.165 --> 31:10.870
I was helping a friend
with a computer problem

31:10.960 --> 31:12.584
most of the night.

31:12.878 --> 31:14.254
Big problem.

31:15.423 --> 31:16.917
Huge, sir.

31:17.758 --> 31:20.593
I'm constantly being scrutinised
by the crew.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.513
Every move I make is monitored
by calculating eyes.

31:23.597 --> 31:26.468
I'm sure at this point
they're in allegiance with Kinvaras.

31:26.559 --> 31:28.717
I can't let them know I'm onto them.

31:28.811 --> 31:30.305
The element of surprise

31:30.396 --> 31:33.432
will be a great advantage
for my final triumph.

31:45.027 --> 31:47.316
Petty Officer Zuger said
he was helping you

31:47.404 --> 31:50.654
the night Seaman MacDonald went over.
Is that true?

31:52.034 --> 31:53.279
In a way.

31:53.619 --> 31:57.070
Are you gonna help me out here,
Petty Officer Carnahan?

31:57.247 --> 32:01.328
I've been downloading a lot of stuff
off the Internet onto my PC.

32:02.544 --> 32:03.707
Porn?

32:04.004 --> 32:07.254
I was pretty sure my CO
was suspicious, so I hired Zuger.

32:07.341 --> 32:11.386
- He cleaned out the hard drive.
- A considerable amount to clean out.

32:12.304 --> 32:15.139
I have a lot of free time
on my hands, sir.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.884
As I thought. Abby matched

32:17.976 --> 32:21.808
the dirt lodged under
Seaman MacDonald's fingernails

32:21.897 --> 32:24.851
with the sedimentary composition
of the ocean floor.

32:24.942 --> 32:28.108
Any signs the suspect had
a dance partner before he went over?

32:28.195 --> 32:30.603
There were abrasions on his hands.

32:30.864 --> 32:32.062
No sign of a struggle?

32:32.157 --> 32:35.407
No. The only bruising I could see
is where the chain was attached.

32:35.494 --> 32:39.195
No, I'm afraid the only struggle
this poor fellow endured

32:39.289 --> 32:41.329
was the one to breathe
when he hit the bottom.

32:41.583 --> 32:42.698
Okay, thanks.

32:42.793 --> 32:44.667
I wish I could say it was my pleasure.

32:44.753 --> 32:45.916
From what I hear,

32:46.004 --> 32:48.246
the afterlife could be
a vast improvement

32:48.340 --> 32:49.669
for a young man so troubled.

32:49.758 --> 32:51.695
You know, there's a great book
I should send you...

32:51.719 --> 32:53.261
Gotta go, Duck.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.323
There are no signs the victim struggled

32:55.347 --> 32:58.265
and our only suspect
has an iron-clad alibi.

32:58.392 --> 33:02.472
- Sure looks like a suicide to me.
- I don't think it's that simple.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.998
You are letting
your personal experience

33:04.022 --> 33:05.102
get in the way here.

33:05.190 --> 33:08.773
No, I'm not talking
about his religious morals.

33:09.111 --> 33:11.269
Okay, I've been reading this diary
for hours

33:11.363 --> 33:14.566
and MacDonald gives no indication
of an intent to kill himself.

33:14.658 --> 33:17.363
- Just the opposite, in fact.
- Go on.

33:17.453 --> 33:20.786
MacDonald seems resolved
to continue his battle with Kinvaras

33:20.873 --> 33:22.450
after he leaves the ship.

33:22.541 --> 33:25.246
So why would a man
so intent on his mission

33:25.335 --> 33:28.123
no matter how deranged,
off himself and end it?

33:28.213 --> 33:31.878
- What else is in his diary?
- I'm on the last entry right now.

33:32.509 --> 33:34.751
Get me Petty Officer Zuger's
records now.

33:34.845 --> 33:36.125
I'm on it.

33:37.055 --> 33:40.590
I need Petty Officer Zuger's records,
please. I'll hold.

33:43.145 --> 33:44.260
What?

33:44.354 --> 33:46.995
Aren't you the least bit interested
to know what I brought you back

33:47.065 --> 33:48.809
- from Puerto Rico?
- No.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.727
- Listen to this.
- Hey, yeah.

33:51.153 --> 33:53.478
MacDonald says that
after he makes his escape

33:53.572 --> 33:57.700
he'll destroy his enemies by releasing
a great plague against the realm

33:57.785 --> 34:00.572
as the sun sets
beneath the next full moon.

34:00.662 --> 34:02.738
- File's on the way.
- Plague?

34:04.291 --> 34:05.489
Plague.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.117
Yeah, here it is.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.166
MacDonald had applied
for the NBC programme.

34:12.174 --> 34:14.665
Nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.429
Passed the physical, flunked the psych.

34:17.513 --> 34:20.181
So what's the realm he's talking about?

34:20.349 --> 34:22.306
I think it's the Foster.

34:22.391 --> 34:25.596
MacDonald was convinced that
the crew was aiding his enemy.

34:25.687 --> 34:28.523
He's gonna set a bio bomb
off on this ship.

34:29.858 --> 34:32.895
- Tell me it's not a full moon tonight.
- Sorry, boss.

34:32.985 --> 34:35.857
- What time does the sun set?
- 23:37 Zulu.

34:35.947 --> 34:39.482
- About an hour from now.
- Get Zuger in front of this computer

34:39.576 --> 34:41.699
and see if he can find out
anything about MacDonald

34:41.786 --> 34:43.779
or a bio weapon in that game site.

34:43.871 --> 34:46.409
Navy ships do not carry
bio-chemical weapons

34:46.500 --> 34:48.576
nor would they have the material
to make one.

34:48.668 --> 34:50.542
Contact Reynolds
at Homeland Security.

34:50.629 --> 34:54.413
He'll know if there's anything
unaccounted for in this region.

34:55.217 --> 34:58.052
- Where's the captain?
- In a staff meeting.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.798
Hey, you can't go in there!

34:59.888 --> 35:03.756
Skipper, I have reason to believe
a bomb, possibly containing a bio agent

35:03.851 --> 35:06.223
is set to detonate aboard this ship
by sunset.

35:06.311 --> 35:08.719
- How real do you think that threat is?
- Very real.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.688
- Sound general quarters.
- Yes, sir.

35:10.774 --> 35:13.347
Deploy the flying squad.
Start with the ventilation systems

35:13.443 --> 35:15.851
and alert sick bay of the situation
and have them stand by.

35:15.946 --> 35:17.226
Aye, aye, sir.

35:18.532 --> 35:20.275
General quarters! General quarters!

35:20.367 --> 35:23.570
All hands, man your stations.
Stand by for further.

35:23.662 --> 35:25.121
General quarters! General quarters!

35:25.205 --> 35:26.284
What are you doing, sir?

35:26.373 --> 35:28.268
Do you know anything about a bomb
aboard this ship?

35:28.292 --> 35:29.406
What?

35:29.501 --> 35:31.896
Did MacDonald ever talk about
delivering a virus aboard the Foster?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.083
No! I don't think so.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.422
Let's get on your site now!

35:42.514 --> 35:44.325
I wanna know if there's
even the slightest clue

35:44.349 --> 35:48.217
about MacDonald setting off
any kind of bio bomb aboard this ship.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.346
Reynolds says
there's no known material missing

35:50.439 --> 35:52.208
but the intel's soft.
They'll continue to check.

35:52.232 --> 35:53.513
Stay on him every five minutes.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.295
Well, he expressly told me
to wait for his call.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.154
I expressly don't give a damn.
Ride his ass.

36:09.791 --> 36:12.365
Die, Kinvaras! Die!

36:12.461 --> 36:14.288
No! He can't do this!

36:14.379 --> 36:16.705
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.511
Weylin hacked me.
And Kinvaras is gone.

36:24.598 --> 36:27.005
Is MacDonald covering his tracks?

36:28.977 --> 36:30.970
You listen to me very closely.

36:31.063 --> 36:35.310
There's a good chance that a bio bomb
is going off on this ship by sunset.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.891
Right now,
you're the best shot we've got to find it.

36:37.986 --> 36:39.397
You give me answers

36:39.488 --> 36:42.987
or I will make sure
you're the last one in line on the evac.

36:43.075 --> 36:47.487
Did MacDonald even hint, in any way,
of taking out this crew?

36:47.579 --> 36:49.204
No, sir. Nothing.

36:51.833 --> 36:55.499
Go over MacDonald's diary again.
Maybe we missed something.

36:55.921 --> 37:00.334
I want to know every detail that
happened between you and MacDonald.

37:03.679 --> 37:06.170
Skipper, the hospitals in Raleigh
are on standby

37:06.264 --> 37:10.179
and the helos from the Washington
and the Bryan are on their way.

37:27.953 --> 37:30.491
We've got a little more
than 20 minutes, Zuger.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.988
What is it you're not telling me?

37:34.918 --> 37:36.827
Do you want the crew
of this ship to die?

37:36.920 --> 37:40.503
He was crazy, you know.
He really thought he was immortal!

37:40.590 --> 37:42.298
He thought you were Kinvaras,
didn't he?

37:42.384 --> 37:44.092
That's why you fought with real swords.

37:44.177 --> 37:47.712
I thought we were just playing the game.
And then he tried to kill me.

37:47.806 --> 37:50.178
- So you killed him?
- No! I just...

37:51.018 --> 37:53.555
- I just challenged him!
- Challenged him to what?

37:53.645 --> 37:55.554
To go UA.
Like he was always talking about!

37:55.647 --> 37:58.683
I told him to take his sword
and swim to shore!

37:59.109 --> 38:02.193
Why was he wearing weights
if he was gonna swim?

38:02.696 --> 38:05.650
Why did he have weights
chained to his waist?

38:07.242 --> 38:11.536
I told him that was the only way
he could prove to me he was immortal.

38:13.206 --> 38:15.413
Why would you let him do that?

38:16.835 --> 38:18.413
To win the game.

38:23.508 --> 38:25.216
This isn't helping us.

38:25.302 --> 38:27.572
- Anything else in those diaries?
- I've been over them twice.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.635
Well, go over them again, Kate!

38:34.686 --> 38:37.011
Nothing yet, sir, and it's almost sunset.

38:37.105 --> 38:39.513
Have Agent Gibbs
report to my sea cabin now.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.146
I'm missing something.
I know I am. How much time?

38:43.236 --> 38:44.517
A little over five minutes.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.591
This stuff MacDonald said
about cutting off the head

38:46.615 --> 38:47.777
so the body will die.

38:47.866 --> 38:50.618
I mean, we're assuming
that is part of setting up

38:50.702 --> 38:52.244
a "plague against the realm."

38:52.329 --> 38:53.929
But what if it meant
two separate things?

38:53.997 --> 38:55.076
Okay.

38:55.874 --> 38:58.246
Zuger's website
and his character were destroyed.

38:58.335 --> 38:59.616
And the plague against the realm

38:59.669 --> 39:02.243
could simply be referring
to a computer virus.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.192
Leaving "cutting off the head"
as another threat.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.247
Exactly.

39:05.342 --> 39:08.343
And MacDonald was sure that
the crew was aligned with his enemy.

39:08.428 --> 39:10.884
He made it clear
he was just as threatened with them

39:10.972 --> 39:12.253
as he was with Kinvaras.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.677
So he's talking about the crew

39:13.767 --> 39:16.037
when he refers to cutting off the head
so the body will die.

39:16.061 --> 39:19.512
- That's what I'm thinking.
- Who's the head of the crew?

39:25.445 --> 39:27.983
My ship is in chaos
because of your hunch, Agent Gibbs.

39:28.073 --> 39:30.231
I'd characterise it
more as a deduction, Skipper.

39:30.325 --> 39:32.178
Whatever the hell it is,
it's pretty damn flimsy.

39:32.202 --> 39:34.195
I appreciate that.
It's all we have to go on.

39:34.287 --> 39:35.947
The seaman's mental attitude is...

39:36.039 --> 39:37.948
Is there some kind of NCIS protocol...

39:38.041 --> 39:39.239
It's not the boat!

39:39.334 --> 39:40.654
- It's a ship.
- It's the skipper.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.355
Where are you
about this time every day, sir?

39:42.379 --> 39:45.024
- I don't see what that has to do...
- Just answer the question, sir!

39:45.048 --> 39:46.859
- Here. Every day I send a...
- We gotta go, now!

39:46.883 --> 39:49.042
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- What the hell?

39:59.312 --> 40:00.807
You all right?

40:02.774 --> 40:04.518
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

40:19.332 --> 40:22.951
I'm finding this
very hard to understand, Abby.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.629
Where did I lose you?

40:25.714 --> 40:30.008
I think somewhere around the part
about Weylin and Kinvaras.

40:30.093 --> 40:34.007
- Okay. Seaman MacDonald was Weylin.
- Got that.

40:34.347 --> 40:37.633
And Petty Officer Zuger was Kinvaras.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.976
Yes, I remember that
'cause it sounds a lot like Canaris.

40:41.062 --> 40:44.313
- What?
- A German navy admiral, World War II.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.350
Okay. Whatever works for you.

40:47.444 --> 40:49.982
So we've got MacDonald, Weylin,

40:50.071 --> 40:54.199
and Zuger, Kinvaras,
battling online in The lmmortals game.

40:55.076 --> 40:56.950
Zuger always wins,

40:57.579 --> 41:01.030
so MacDonald challenges him to a fight,
like, for real.

41:01.416 --> 41:05.034
And they both buy officers' swords
at the Navy Exchange in Puerto Rico.

41:05.128 --> 41:06.706
But they were enlisted.

41:06.796 --> 41:08.374
Let's say they bought
their commissions.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.956
That was done at one time, you know.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.260
So they're sword fighting
and MacDonald wins.

41:14.721 --> 41:18.719
He cuts Zuger. Zuger gets pissed,
and he goes back to the one thing that

41:18.808 --> 41:21.216
he knows he can beat MacDonald at.

41:21.519 --> 41:22.551
The lmmortals.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.104
Yes and no.

41:24.522 --> 41:27.726
Zuger realises that
MacDonald has tripped out

41:27.817 --> 41:29.976
and thought he really was Weylin.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.442
So Zuger challenges him to prove it.

41:32.530 --> 41:34.903
MacDonald puts weights
around his waist

41:34.991 --> 41:39.321
jumps ship, and tries to walk
across the bottom of the bay to dry land.

41:39.704 --> 41:41.199
You know, Abby,

41:41.289 --> 41:44.824
sometimes the dead
make more sense to me than the living.

41:46.628 --> 41:47.826
Me, too.

41:59.557 --> 42:01.052
You all right?

42:01.518 --> 42:04.269
I just can't get over how the line
between reality and fantasy

42:04.354 --> 42:06.845
was so blurred for Seaman MacDonald.

42:07.148 --> 42:10.517
For him, destroying Zuger's website

42:10.610 --> 42:14.560
was every bit as real and violent
as trying to kill the skipper.

42:15.198 --> 42:18.947
I'm so glad my parents pushed me
into sports in high school.

42:19.953 --> 42:23.867
Aren't you interested at all in what
I brought you back from Puerto Rico?

42:23.957 --> 42:25.332
- Sure.
- All right.

42:30.630 --> 42:34.295
- You've gotta be kidding.
- It's a bikini. Two-piece.

42:35.468 --> 42:36.631
A bottom.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.546
- And a hat?
- Puerto Rican.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.131
Any chance you're gonna try that on?

42:43.268 --> 42:44.596
You first.

42:44.978 --> 42:48.477
- Trust me, not gonna fit.
- Pigs. I work with pigs.

42:53.486 --> 42:54.897
It's a fantasy RPG book,

42:54.988 --> 42:57.905
complete with character sheets
and dice.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.364
Baby steps, Gibbs, baby steps.

43:00.827 --> 43:04.445
- It's in Spanish.
- There's just no pleasing you, is there?
