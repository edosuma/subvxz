00:00.734 --> 00:02.403
Previously on Nashville...

00:04.438 --> 00:06.074
- Jonah! Oh, we love you!

00:06.107 --> 00:07.608
- I'm Jonah.
- Maddie.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.611
- You're gonna like fly me
home, to Nashville?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.580
- Well, actually,
my pilot will, but yeah.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.548
- Totally.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.084
It could just be dinner.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.553
- This thing's
the size of my head,

00:19.587 --> 00:22.556
and this really isn't
my kind of task.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.159
- I actually think this is
the exact kind of task you need.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.128
I'll come check in
on you later.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.110
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.815
- Well, you know how much
I care about this company.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.219
And, uh, you know how much
respect I have for you.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.820
It hasn't always been
smooth sailing,

00:52.853 --> 00:54.322
but at the end of the day,
I wouldn't trade

00:54.355 --> 00:55.656
this experience for anything.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.292
- I feel the same way,
but what are we--

00:58.326 --> 00:59.793
- I'm not pulling out
my investment.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.262
You can breathe.
Okay.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.530
But I am making a change.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.199
An opportunity has
come up for me

01:05.233 --> 01:08.602
and I've decided to pursue
a senate bid.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.371
In California.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.143
- Wow.
- I know. Yeah.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.577
I'm still getting used
to saying it out loud.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.546
But I have been thinking
about it for a few years,

01:18.579 --> 01:21.249
and I've had a quiet exploratory
committee putting feelers out,

01:21.282 --> 01:24.218
and you know, the polls
look promising,

01:24.252 --> 01:26.854
so, it feels like
the right time.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.556
- My goodness.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.658
I mean, if anybody
can do this, it's you.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.727
- Thank you.
That means a lot.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.232
- * Whoa oh

01:38.266 --> 01:40.868
* She's the kind you'll
give your life for *

01:40.901 --> 01:43.571
* The kind you'll
thank your God for *

01:43.604 --> 01:46.340
* The kind you'll
drive 24 minutes *

01:46.374 --> 01:49.177
* Out of your way just
to make a date *

01:50.911 --> 01:52.513
* She's the kind
that meets your family *

01:52.546 --> 01:55.149
* The one that
changes everything *

01:55.183 --> 01:57.885
* The kind that's
got a lot more to her *

01:57.918 --> 02:00.888
* Than just
Just a pretty face *

02:00.921 --> 02:02.890
* She's a different
kind of hot *

02:02.923 --> 02:06.427
* Hot-hot-hot
oh so beautiful *

02:06.460 --> 02:09.597
* She's a different
kind of hot *

02:09.630 --> 02:12.633
- Morning, sunshine.
Time to wake up.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.335
- Mama's way ahead of you.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.903
- Well, look at you.
- Yeah.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.672
I thought the three of us
could go get some pancakes.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.375
With the two most beautiful
girls in the world?

02:21.409 --> 02:22.810
Sign me up.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.278
- Well, I want us to
connect more as a family,

02:24.312 --> 02:25.913
not just see each other.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.316
That's why there's so many
problems in this world

02:28.349 --> 02:29.950
is we interact

02:29.983 --> 02:34.655
but we never truly communicate
on a deeper level.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.490
I'm just telling you
what I believe.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.827
- Yeah.
For the last week and a half.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.462
- You know, you have
an awful lot of opinions

02:41.495 --> 02:43.197
for somebody who's
never even met Darius.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.300
I think that's enough.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.370
- That is not the same.
I want you to talk to him.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.340
See the community
that he created.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.974
Come with me.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.943
- All right.
All right.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.578
Some time when I have
a day free we can.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.214
- Emily said she can
watch Cadence tomorrow.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.585
- Give it a chance.
Please?

03:04.618 --> 03:05.919
For me.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.688
- Anything for you.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.964
- You ready to
go get pancakes?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.377
- Uh, you know you
could have just yelled.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.611
- Too much effort.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.413
- What happened to
this $6 million man, huh?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.348
He get hit by a truck?
- I'm just tired.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.450
I didn't sleep
well last night.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.252
- Is it because of
what Zach posted?

03:38.286 --> 03:40.421
I can't see Zach's posts.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.356
I blocked him after
I accidently liked

03:42.390 --> 03:44.425
that picture of him and Mark.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.595
Why?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.830
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.607
Hello.
- Hello.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.544
- I got you black.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.546
I couldn't remember if--oh.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.281
- That's perfect.
- Great.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.282
- It was good.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.650
It was good.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.419
I went to Vanderbilt,
and I wanted to see

04:11.452 --> 04:14.021
what it would be like to be
a grownup studying there.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.425
- And it was pretty
daunting, actually.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.459
- Yeah.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.061
But I also worked on
a song a little bit. So...

04:21.094 --> 04:22.363
- Busy day.
- Yeah.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.864
- When do I get
to hear the song?

04:23.897 --> 04:27.568
- Soon. Right now
it's a bit of a mess, so...

04:27.601 --> 04:29.303
- I'm sure
it's a beautiful mess.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.040
- Sorry.

04:33.073 --> 04:37.411
- I don't know.
I'm just, uh, I don't know.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.614
- Yeah, well,
I'm right there with you.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.050
- You know, Jake asked me
where I was the other day.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.519
And now I just don't
know what to say.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.389
- Maybe we don't need
to say anything

04:48.422 --> 04:49.790
quite yet to the kids.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.760
You know, until we figure out
what we're doing here.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.795
- Yeah. That sounds good.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.331
Okay.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.468
And it would have been
a good idea, too.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.770
- Daphne. Hey.
- Dad.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.538
- Hello, Louisa.
Hi, guys.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.539
- Hey.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.841
- Hey.
- Give me a hug.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.443
Oh, you got your
cinnamon mocha there?

05:09.477 --> 05:10.243
- I did.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.012
- She loves
the cinnamon mocha.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.348
I've got to try that.
I keep meaning to try that.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.450
- Okay, um, we're going
to sit outside.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.851
- Oh, yeah, it's pretty out.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.389
Okay.
Good to see you, Louisa.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.994
Or we could do it that way.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.696
- Yeah. Looks like
we're doing it that way.

05:28.729 --> 05:29.797
- Yeah.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.109
- School.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.677
You know, that thing
that's legally required.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.045
- No, no, no.
Let me make you some breakfast.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.780
Most important meal of the day.
- Granola bar.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.449
- That--that is not breakfast.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.917
- It says breakfast
right there on the package.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.151
- Okay.
Daph--Daphne, wait.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.755
- You know you can talk
to me about anything, right?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.624
You know that?

05:56.657 --> 05:57.758
- Yeah, I know.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.061
- Yesterday at the coffee shop,
I thought that maybe we could--

06:01.094 --> 06:02.396
- Carpool's here.
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.664
- Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

06:04.865 --> 06:05.666
Tardiness counts
against my grade.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.000
Do you want me
to get into college?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.636
- Go.
- Thank you.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.173
- Avery, welcome.
I'm so glad to meet you.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.444
- Same here.
I've heard great things.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.845
- Juliette, Laura was
hoping to go over

06:17.878 --> 06:19.447
this week's volunteer
schedule with you.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.781
Perhaps I'll show
Avery around a bit,

06:20.814 --> 06:22.950
then we can meet
back up later.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.685
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.822
- We're heading to one of my
favorite parts of the campus:

06:28.856 --> 06:31.792
The meditation garden.
- That sounds peaceful.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.761
I can see why Juliette
likes it here.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.564
- It's amazing how far she's
come in a short amount of time.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.666
Isn't it?

06:38.699 --> 06:43.103
- The way she's allowing herself
to be more honest, more present.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.973
She's been stuck in
a self-destructive pattern

06:46.006 --> 06:48.208
for so long,
it's remarkable how open

06:48.241 --> 06:51.178
she's become to the possibility
of something better.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.714
- Well, she's
a remarkable person.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.017
- Look, I understand you
being protective of her.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.721
Just know I'm not trying
to be some kind of guru.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.855
I hate that word.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.491
I--I don't have all the answers.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.026
I can only speak from
what I know to be true.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.497
Even after decades of
practicing coherent philosophy.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.634
- So what is coherent
philosophy exactly?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.503
I mean, you... you came up
with it, right?

07:15.536 --> 07:16.737
- I refined the technique.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.140
And I've certainly brought
the message to a wide audience.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.511
But the ideas behind
the movement are far older

07:23.544 --> 07:26.980
than you or I, perhaps older
than civilization itself.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.683
- Yeah.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.652
- Okay. Just lift with
your legs or something.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.987
- I been lifting with my legs
since before you were born.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.556
- Ah, shut up.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.026
- You know when you
just kind of need a change?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.695
- Yeah, in theory, I guess.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.864
Me, I could use
a little less change.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.799
Between Zach leaving, and...

07:48.068 --> 07:49.737
- Is everything okay
with Jessie?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.572
- Yeah, yeah.
I mean, they have been.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.873
Just Daphne.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.678
- No, no, she just saw us out.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.113
I didn't know what to say
so I played it off.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.551
You know, now,
she says she's fine.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.752
She doesn't want
to go into it.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.019
- Ugh.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.056
Well, maybe she just needs some
time to process it on her own.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.859
- She's been through so much.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.929
How can I add to that?
Just... feels selfish.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.297
- Oh, okay.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.732
That is the last word
I would ever use with you,

08:18.766 --> 08:20.568
especially in regards
to those girls.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.102
You do everything
that's best for them,

08:22.135 --> 08:24.071
and you keep them happy.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.775
You're a person, too.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.209
You deserve to be loved.

08:29.242 --> 08:33.146
That might not be what this is,
but what if it could be?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.084
- I like her, like, a lot,
you know,

08:37.117 --> 08:39.787
but sometimes
when we're together,

08:39.820 --> 08:40.788
it just feels...

08:42.155 --> 08:43.824
I don't know, strange.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.058
You know? Wrong.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.097
She's not Rayna.
- Yeah.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.869
- Maybe I'm not ready.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.073
- That makes sense.

09:00.107 --> 09:06.079
The thing is, you might not
ever feel ready.

09:06.113 --> 09:09.016
Completely.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.118
- Oh, thanks, that makes me
feel a lot better.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.686
- You know what I mean.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.667
- Hey. I think
I should be on the list.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.735
Maddie Jaymes.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.940
- I'll show you
to the VIP room.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.177
* Drop it down low
and take it back high *

09:37.210 --> 09:38.812
* I don't need introduction *

09:38.846 --> 09:40.013
* Follow my simple
instruction *

09:40.047 --> 09:41.248
- No, no, no.
This way, please.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.016
- * Sway to the right

09:43.050 --> 09:45.118
* Drop it down low
and take it back high *

09:45.152 --> 09:46.754
* I don't need introduction *

09:46.787 --> 09:48.155
* Follow my simple
instruction *

09:48.188 --> 09:49.322
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your night.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.258
- * Wine to the left
Sway to the right *

09:51.291 --> 09:53.126
* Drop it down low
and take it back high *

09:53.160 --> 09:55.128
* I don't need introduction *

09:55.162 --> 09:56.864
* Follow my simple
instruction *

09:56.897 --> 09:58.666
* Wine to the left
Sway to the right *

09:58.699 --> 10:00.167
* Drop it down low
and take it back high *

10:00.200 --> 10:02.069
- Maddie! Hey!

10:02.102 --> 10:03.871
Um, come meet
my friends, yeah?

10:03.904 --> 10:04.938
- Okay.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.241
- That's Roy, that's Mac,
and that's Twig.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.143
- Hi.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.779
- That's Roy, Mac--
you know what? It's fine.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.013
Never mind.
You'll meet them later, yeah?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.682
- Okay.
- Listen, listen.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.717
I've got to tell you, it is
such a pleasure to meet you

10:16.750 --> 10:19.219
because I have heard
like a lot about you

10:19.252 --> 10:20.988
from this dude right here.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.756
- You know, just don't
even listen to him.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.991
He's got a condition known
as douchebag syndrome.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.760
I'm going to give you
a little secret.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.696
You should probably take
these for when Jonah starts

10:28.729 --> 10:30.030
talking to kind
of drown him out. Okay?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.231
- I'm okay.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.332
- Yes.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.767
Do you want like a coke?
- Yes.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.037
- Coke. Yeah, coming up.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.207
- Sure.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.342
- I love your voice.
- Thank you.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.979
- And I want it
on my next album.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.182
- We are doing
a track tomorrow,

10:49.216 --> 10:51.151
and I want you to sing on it.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.421
- 100%.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.391
- * I don't
need introduction *

10:58.425 --> 11:00.728
* Follow my simple
instruction *

11:07.167 --> 11:10.003
Not too cold?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.905
- We're good. Thanks.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.779
Can you say something?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.948
- It was interesting.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.182
- You still think it's crap.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.151
- No. I don't know what it is.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.419
That's the problem.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.389
He's one guy who
created a philosophy

11:29.422 --> 11:31.091
and now it's like
he's controlling

11:31.124 --> 11:32.159
everything you think.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.761
- He is not controlling.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.895
He's--

11:34.928 --> 11:36.263
Never mind.

11:36.296 --> 11:41.201
Look, you have a right
to your own opinion.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.338
I guess I'd just hoped
once you'd talked to him

11:45.372 --> 11:50.343
and Laura and everybody
that you would feel it.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.981
- That it's not about control.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.249
It's about how real they are.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.484
And open.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.854
They accept me exactly
where I am.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.489
And when I'm with them,

12:02.522 --> 12:06.827
I feel like maybe
I can accept myself, too.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.996
- I'm glad.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.898
I mean, I want you
to have that.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.167
- Of course.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.979
- * I'll be there for you *

12:26.013 --> 12:30.851
* As long as you're
right there, too *

12:30.884 --> 12:32.485
* I'll be there for you *

12:32.519 --> 12:35.322
* Take my word and you know
I'll follow through *

12:35.355 --> 12:38.158
Yo, yo. Yo, stop.
Bro, this...

12:39.860 --> 12:41.995
- I'm not feeling
this hype at all.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.864
- It's modern, it's hip,
I mean, that's you.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.165
- Yeah, man, that's me
two years ago.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.067
This whole album has
to feel different.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.202
It can't be like a rehash,
you know what I'm saying?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.171
Like can we just break it
down to piano and drums,

12:51.204 --> 12:52.339
see what that sounds like?

12:52.372 --> 12:53.540
- Yeah, no doubt.
I got you.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.541
- Cool.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.845
Yeah, you were perfect.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.546
- Yeah.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.089
- Yes. Yes.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.263
* When you're out
in the cold *

13:16.296 --> 13:18.198
* Then get thrown
to the flames *

13:18.231 --> 13:20.033
* When a moment feels good

13:20.067 --> 13:21.368
* But it ends in pain

13:21.401 --> 13:23.270
* When you wanna get out

13:23.303 --> 13:25.038
* And you're done
with the game *

13:25.072 --> 13:28.241
* Whoa no

13:28.275 --> 13:31.979
* When you're losing it all
over some bad advice *

13:32.012 --> 13:35.415
* Yeah I've seen it before
Maybe once or twice *

13:35.448 --> 13:40.020
* At the end of your rope I look
up to the sky and I pray *

13:40.053 --> 13:42.055
* You stay alive

13:42.089 --> 13:44.457
- * After the smoke has gone

13:44.491 --> 13:51.631
- * I open my eyes
and I see you *

13:51.664 --> 13:56.169
* I'm tired of this fight
to get us through *

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
* When our world
starts to change *

14:01.108 --> 14:03.243
* Will you feel the same?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.478
- Maybe I could mentor
a kid or something.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.415
Is that stupid?
- No. There are no stupid ideas.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.118
This is time for you to just
explore all of your options.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.385
- Well, that's the thing,

14:12.419 --> 14:13.420
there's so many
paths I could take.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.721
How do I help people the most?

14:14.754 --> 14:17.424
- Well, you've just got to find
something that you connect with.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.260
Something that lights you up.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.962
- Is that what
psychology is for you?

14:21.995 --> 14:23.430
- In a way.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.532
Although every time I look
at that course catalog,

14:25.565 --> 14:28.268
I immediately start
questioning myself.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.437
You know, whether
I could actually

14:30.470 --> 14:33.240
walk away
from music or not.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.674
I mean, I know what
my heart wants,

14:34.707 --> 14:38.311
but we know that
that's never practical.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.646
- Should I ask
about him or not?

14:39.679 --> 14:40.647
- No.
- Okay.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.449
- I swore to myself
I wouldn't bring him up

14:42.482 --> 14:43.683
because I don't want you
to be in the middle.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.485
- I already am,
so you might as well.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.087
Unless you don't want to
talk about it, which is fine.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.355
- Daphne saw us out together.
- Oh, my God.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.023
- I'm sure you
already knew that.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.393
- Yeah.
- But the look on her face.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.162
Oh, Scarlett,
it was not good.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.496
And now things are different.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.366
He's, like,
pulled back, and I...

14:59.399 --> 15:00.467
I don't know what I expected.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.035
Of course he's got walls up.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.236
Of course the girls
are going to hate me.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.072
I would hate me.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.974
All right, the girls are going
to feel whatever they feel.

15:07.007 --> 15:10.010
And I know you're always so
careful never to hurt anybody.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.345
It's not like y'all meant
to fall for one another.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.247
And now you're both
handling it the best you can.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.551
- Right. Yeah.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.153
- Woo.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.089
- Hey, you didn't suck, bro.
Congrats.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.523
- Thanks, bro.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.025
- I'm starving. You guys
wanna go to Soulshine?

15:25.058 --> 15:26.626
- Yeah.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.330
- Okay. Guys, we've gotta
use the back.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.431
- Let's go.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.266
- Go, go, go.
Come on!

15:33.300 --> 15:34.467
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go!

15:34.501 --> 15:35.635
Come on, come on.
Come on!

15:35.668 --> 15:38.205
- There they are!
Hey, Jonah!

15:38.238 --> 15:39.672
- Oh...
- Mike!

15:39.706 --> 15:42.042
- Open it, open it, open it!

15:42.075 --> 15:44.044
Get in, get in, get in.
Lock the door, lock the door!

15:46.146 --> 15:48.181
- Jonah, I just
want one, Jonah!

15:50.017 --> 15:51.651
- Okay. Excuse me for checking
my blind spot, all right?

15:51.684 --> 15:54.154
- Your head's a blind spot.
Drive.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.525
- It's okay, it's okay,
I've got you.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.727
- Eat our dust, stalkarazzi.
- Yeah!

16:00.760 --> 16:02.229
- Woo!

16:02.262 --> 16:03.563
- Hoohoo!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.467
- Hey, Jonah!
- Jonah!

16:12.605 --> 16:15.042
- Hey, Zach.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.644
- It's nice to see you.
What brings you by?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.246
- An artist can't
visit his label?

16:19.279 --> 16:20.547
- No, you can do
whatever you want.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.615
It's just, you know, it's--

16:24.251 --> 16:26.553
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.654
- I was just, uh, finishing--

16:27.687 --> 16:29.322
- Yeah.
- --packing stuff up.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
You want me to put
that in the car?

16:31.191 --> 16:32.592
- Yeah, thank you, Mark.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.560
- Yeah.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.164
- I'll just be--
- Yeah.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.403
- So you're really
going to run.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.072
- I want to make
a difference.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.506
I want to make my home state
a better place.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.241
- Will--

16:48.275 --> 16:50.110
- Were you not even going
to say goodbye to me?

16:50.143 --> 16:52.245
- I kind of thought
we already had said goodbye.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.214
- What about
let's stay friends?

16:54.247 --> 16:57.217
Because you're the one who
talked about staying friends,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.285
or were you just
blowing smoke--

16:58.318 --> 17:00.820
- No. I meant it. I just--

17:00.853 --> 17:03.190
I'm always going
to care about you, okay?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.524
I just needed space.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.059
And it looks like
you did, too.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.594
You look great.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.062
- God, I shouldn't
have come here.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.098
I know, I know.
I just--

17:14.334 --> 17:15.835
I just wanted
to see you one last time

17:15.868 --> 17:17.670
for some closure,
or something.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.273
- I get it.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.209
I'm glad you came by.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.845
- Will.
- I tried so hard.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.714
- I know. I just
couldn't get over you

17:27.747 --> 17:30.183
walking out on me that day.
I needed you to have my back.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.551
- So I screw up one time
and you can't forgive me?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.153
- I guess I'm not
really good at that.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.456
- Yeah.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.226
- I'm sorry.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.662
- Well, I hope it all
works out well

17:42.695 --> 17:45.465
for you and Mark
out in California.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.267
- Thank you.
I wish you the best.

18:10.890 --> 18:14.527
- Um, I'm good.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.364
I'm just tying up
some loose ends here, um,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.199
before Zach and Alyssa
leave town, so...

18:19.232 --> 18:21.134
- No, I meant about Daphne.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.503
How did things go?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.238
- You know what, I'm so sorry.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.174
I'm right in the middle
of something right now.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.876
- Oh, yeah, no, you're busy.
Sorry.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.179
I just--I was just calling to
say that,

18:32.212 --> 18:33.746
um, I'm here if you--

18:33.780 --> 18:35.515
- That's very sweet.
Thank you.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.285
- Oh, yes, sorry.
Yeah, you're busy.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.353
So, I'll let you go then
and I guess we can

18:40.387 --> 18:43.623
just talk later or whenever.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.292
- Okay. All right, thank you.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.859
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.308
- Look, all right,
this is the part.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.376
This shot right
there is an homage

19:03.410 --> 19:05.678
to the classic Italian horror
film "Profondo Rosso"--

19:05.712 --> 19:07.547
- Bro, nobody cares.
Shut up.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.516
- Dude, you should shut up,
because do you even know

19:09.549 --> 19:11.251
what the twist in this is?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.719
- Shut up, dude.
You're going to ruin it for her.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.886
Be quiet.
Be quiet.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.289
- Hey Maddie.
- Yeah.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.658
- You realize the only
reason Jonah picked this movie

19:18.691 --> 19:21.628
was so you'd cling onto him
when you get scared, right?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.664
- No.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.971
- What are you guys
looking at on there, huh?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.573
Porn?
You little perverts.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.508
- Yeah.
- It's actually clown porn.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.976
Uh, and it's
starring your mom.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.611
It's really great
work from her.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.613
- Yeah, funny. Funny.
Let me see.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.349
- No. No.
- Yeah.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.683
- Dude, that's kind of weird
you want to look at your mom.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.851
- No, it's not.
- I don't condone that.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.860
- Stupid.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.542
- I'm good, thanks.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.546
- I'm sorry if that was like
weird out there, you know.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.982
- It's okay.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.619
- Just, um, yeah,
you know how it is.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.454
People like love
to blow everything up

20:21.488 --> 20:22.655
into such a huge deal.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.790
- Yeah, I mean,
just so you know,

20:23.823 --> 20:25.525
I didn't think
it was a huge deal.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.660
It's not like I'm your
girlfriend or anything.

20:27.694 --> 20:31.964
And people probably won't
even believe that, anyway.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.534
Everyone knows you date like
supermodels and actresses.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.336
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.705
Just so you know,
I don't really care

20:38.738 --> 20:40.573
what people think about me.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.375
- You seem like you got upset.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.343
- No, I'm not.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.479
I just--I hate all these
stupid distractions.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.781
Especially when they like get
in the way of me

20:48.815 --> 20:51.451
trying to know
a really cool girl.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.388
- Would you still
think I'm cool

20:55.422 --> 20:57.023
if I watched the rest
of the movie like this?

20:57.056 --> 20:57.690
- Yeah, I would.

20:57.724 --> 20:58.858
- Yes, I would.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.660
Look, I'll do it, too.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.930
- All right.
Help me smooth this out.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.032
- Oh, those ribs smell
like heaven.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.501
- Try to push away
the darkness from my past.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.002
But once I embraced it.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.738
- Hey, Bill.
It's really good to see you.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.072
- I've taken responsibility.
- Welcome.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.678
- Hey, can you
save me a biscuit?

21:25.752 --> 21:26.753
- Hey.

21:30.590 --> 21:35.562
- * When morning comes up
over the hill *

21:35.595 --> 21:36.963
- Sing out.

21:36.996 --> 21:43.636
- * And leaves you a new day
on your windowsill *

21:43.670 --> 21:49.876
* Know I love you still

21:49.909 --> 21:56.616
* Oh and I always will

21:59.986 --> 22:01.821
- That was beautiful, Juliette.
Thank you.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.056
- Thank you.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.661
- What would happen if nobody

22:08.695 --> 22:10.763
ever praised you
for your voice?

22:10.797 --> 22:13.466
Would you still sing?

22:13.500 --> 22:17.670
You've used this gift you have
to win approval from others.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.707
Millions of people
think you're wonderful.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.442
So why don't you?

22:22.475 --> 22:26.579
Why isn't all of this fame
and success enough?

22:27.947 --> 22:30.082
- 'Cause I'm greedy.

22:30.116 --> 22:35.455
- Or because true fulfillment
doesn't come from out there.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.689
It's within you.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.826
You can access it, if you're
willing to put in the work.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.128
- I've never been afraid
of a little hard work.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.663
- That's good.
- Yeah.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.098
- Because together
I think we can get

22:46.132 --> 22:49.101
to the root of what's
been holding you back.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.004
It'll make taking an honest look
at how you got to this point,

22:52.038 --> 22:53.873
examining yourself,
and the people

22:53.906 --> 22:56.108
you've chosen to surround
yourself with.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.878
- I don't know if I would.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.514
If I would sing if nobody
told me I was good.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.717
- If you take this journey,
you won't have to wonder.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.020
You won't have to look
outside for validation.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.891
You'll make music purely
for the joy of it.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.464
* Burning bridges,
a sacred cow *

23:17.497 --> 23:21.067
* I know the feelings
right for sure *

23:21.100 --> 23:24.837
* Do you love me
Do you love me *

23:24.871 --> 23:27.474
* Do you love me tonight

23:27.507 --> 23:29.976
- Damn, man,
I would kill to lift 300.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.713
- Oh, it just takes
practice, that's all.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.147
- 285's my max.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.849
Every time I think
I'm making progress

23:36.883 --> 23:38.718
I just hit that wall,
you know?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.853
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.590
- Maybe you can give me
some pointers?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.057
* Do you love me

23:45.091 --> 23:47.894
* Do you love me tonight

23:55.234 --> 23:56.736
- Hey.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.204
- Oh, hey.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.941
Uh... This is my roommate.
This is Dave.

24:01.974 --> 24:02.942
- Dan.
- Dan, sorry.

24:02.975 --> 24:03.876
- That's okay.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.244
- I was just going out.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.780
- Yeah, we were--
Yeah, we were just--

24:09.616 --> 24:11.584
- Oh.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.219
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.092
- Come on.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.238
- No.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.706
- Just give me a second here.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.877
- Hey, hey.

24:37.910 --> 24:41.614
It's okay. It's okay.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.753
- This is so weird.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.588
- Yeah. It happens.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.594
- I mean, we barely even
went on one date

24:54.627 --> 24:56.663
and the entire internet
is saying we're in love.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.631
- The entire internet. Wow.
- Yes, I'm serious.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.132
There's already
a subreddit page about

25:00.166 --> 25:02.034
how I'm not good
enough for him.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.670
I mean, how many times
do I have to deal with

25:03.703 --> 25:06.238
this whole mean internet thing?
- I'm sorry, baby.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.641
It's just part of
the price of fame, I guess.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.743
You know, being with
someone who is famous.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.311
- Did you ever deal
with this with mom?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.947
- A little, but, you know,
not to the same degree

25:14.981 --> 25:16.916
that you younger stars
got to now.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.785
- What am I getting
myself into?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.086
- I don't know, baby.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.788
I just don't want you
to get hurt, that's all.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.623
- But I mean, I guess
it's like this anytime

25:23.656 --> 25:26.826
you fall for anyone, you know,
knowing you might get hurt.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.929
- Can I go to
Louisa's for dinner?

25:29.962 --> 25:32.031
- No, sweetie.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.635
Look, we've got
to talk a second, okay?

25:37.336 --> 25:39.606
This is nothing, you know,
bad or anything,

25:39.639 --> 25:41.841
I just need to clear
the air a second.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.275
It's about me and Jessie.

25:43.309 --> 25:47.947
All right, we're--we have
feelings for each other.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.716
Um, and I don't even
know what they are,

25:49.749 --> 25:52.284
honestly, but it's new,
and it's confusing,

25:52.318 --> 25:53.686
and that's why I didn't
say anything about it,

25:53.720 --> 25:54.921
but then you know,

25:54.954 --> 25:56.889
we ran into you the other day
when we were out and about.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.124
And I didn't want
to make it look

25:58.157 --> 25:59.325
like we're hiding
something, so...

25:59.358 --> 26:00.793
- Okay.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.195
- Doesn't seem like
it's okay, sweetie.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.331
- I just can't believe
you didn't tell us.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.067
Like, that we had
to find out by accident.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.736
Like, just a big secret.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.970
- No, it's not like
it's a big secret.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.872
I just didn't know
what it was,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.306
so I didn't want to throw it
at you before then, you know?

26:14.340 --> 26:17.677
- Okay. I get it.
I just want you to be happy.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.714
- Yeah, just be happy.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.683
- Thank you.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.617
I love you guys.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.853
- Love you.
- So much. No more secrets.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.087
Just dinner.

26:36.395 --> 26:40.366
- Oh, thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.202
- I'm glad I could fit you in.
So what's going on?

26:43.235 --> 26:46.773
- Well, this thing happened
the other day.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.408
Or didn't happen.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.043
I'm--I'm having trouble--

26:51.077 --> 26:54.046
I mean, I couldn't, uh...

26:56.015 --> 26:58.417
Stand at attention?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.953
And I've never had a problem
in that area, ever.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.889
- You're having trouble
achieving erection?

27:04.056 --> 27:05.992
By yourself, with a partner?

27:06.025 --> 27:08.828
- I don't have a real partner
anymore because we broke up.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.798
- Sorry to hear that.
- Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.000
I actually met
someone new recently.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.969
But I can't even...

27:17.003 --> 27:19.405
- No.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.174
Recreational?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.010
- Uh...

27:24.043 --> 27:25.244
Is there anything
you could give me,

27:25.277 --> 27:27.947
like, Viagra or something?

27:27.980 --> 27:28.948
- We can certainly
talk about that.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.350
This kind of thing can
also be psychological.

27:31.383 --> 27:35.387
Depression from a breakup
can affect sexual response.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.157
- Something else
I can blame on my ex.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.994
- I'll have my nurse
take some samples.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.366
- Hey.
- Yo.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.368
- Uh, he is running late.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.739
But I am here to
keep you entertained.

27:52.772 --> 27:53.906
So don't worry.

27:53.940 --> 27:57.910
Um...
Uh, do you want a drink?

27:57.944 --> 27:59.111
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.280
How about this one?

28:01.313 --> 28:03.816
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.853
Um, hi, hello.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.354
Hi, is this thing on?
I'm not sure.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.757
Hi, Nashville.
How y'all doing?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.491
My name is Twig Wysecki.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.393
Most of you probably know
me as the guy

28:14.426 --> 28:16.395
who's holding
Jonah Ford's beer, though.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.465
And no, I will not
sell you photos

28:19.498 --> 28:22.368
of his prepubescent
awkward phase on eBay.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.937
- Wait, you've really
known him that long?

28:24.971 --> 28:27.373
- Yeah. Since eighth grade
when he and his friends

28:27.406 --> 28:28.941
threw my backpack
in the toilet.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.176
- Unh-unh.
- Yeah.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.911
- Yeah.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.245
- That's horrible.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.981
- No it was whatever.
It's was like...

28:35.014 --> 28:35.748
I mean, I was a dork.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.150
I would have
ripped on me, too.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.219
But I straight up dressed

28:40.252 --> 28:42.789
like my grandmother
picked out my clothes

28:42.822 --> 28:44.223
because she did.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.058
That's true.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.293
- Oh my gosh.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.461
- Yeah, so one day I just like
completely had it with them,

28:49.495 --> 28:50.963
right, so I just started
coming back at them

28:50.997 --> 28:52.965
with whatever
I could think of.

28:52.999 --> 28:57.036
I told Jonah that his face

28:57.069 --> 28:59.839
looked like his butt threw up.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.140
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.075
So I'm thinking,
I'm such an idiot

29:03.109 --> 29:05.812
because I'm going to get
my ass kicked by these guys.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.914
But Jonah
just starts laughing.

29:07.947 --> 29:11.117
And he calls me over
to his lunch table,

29:11.150 --> 29:12.451
which was a big deal.
- Wow.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.888
- And yeah, we were
friends after that.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.791
Like, when he started
becoming famous.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.259
- Oh, my God,
that was so weird.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.962
It was like completely
bizarro alternate reality.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.164
It's like I can't believe
it's my life sometimes.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.565
It's crazy.
- I know what you mean.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.367
I mean, obviously,
not the same thing.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.069
- It's ridiculous.
- I know.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.203
- It is ridiculous.
- I know.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.372
- Yeah. I mean, people
treat Jonah

29:33.405 --> 29:35.174
like he's some kind
of god or something.

29:35.207 --> 29:39.011
He gets his nose hair trimmed,
and it's a national headline.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.049
Sorry. Sorry.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.283
I probably wasn't supposed
to tell you he has nose hair.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.985
That's my bad.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.019
Just keep that
between us, okay?

29:47.053 --> 29:48.955
- Just never speak of it again.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.859
- I'm good, thank you.
Okay.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.526
- I'm totally good.
- Let me know, though.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.928
- I'm good, thank you.
- Okay, I'm just doing my job.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.129
- Thank you.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.481
- Hm.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.521
Hey.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.323
- Hey, did I catch you
at a bad time?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.125
- No, no, I'm glad you called.
I--

30:26.158 --> 30:28.460
- I was wondering if you might
like to go out to dinner again.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.197
- Oh, wow.

30:31.230 --> 30:35.434
Sorry, I'm--I definitely
wasn't expecting that.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.336
Um, I've been thinking--

30:37.369 --> 30:39.338
- I promise it'll be
a much better dinner,

30:39.371 --> 30:40.940
and if it's about the--

30:40.973 --> 30:42.174
- Yeah, Deacon, I don't
want to come between

30:42.208 --> 30:43.409
you and your girls, you know.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.944
Especially not Daphne.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.412
I know she's in
a fragile place,

30:46.445 --> 30:49.015
and if this were to send her
into another depression,

30:49.048 --> 30:51.183
I just--I don't think
I could live with that. So--

30:51.217 --> 30:53.152
- I'm sorry this is all
so complicated.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.520
- No, no, it's not your fault.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.088
Really, it's mine.
It's just--

30:56.122 --> 30:57.924
- No, it's not your fault.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.092
- No, I think that
maybe it's better that we,

31:00.126 --> 31:03.095
um, just stop before--

31:03.129 --> 31:04.330
- Well, maybe we could--

31:04.363 --> 31:05.664
- You know, I have to get
off the phone actually.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.966
- Jessie, wait.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.267
- No, I'm--Jake just
walked in so,

31:08.300 --> 31:11.237
I'll call you later or--okay.
- Okay.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.404
- Bye.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.213
- I'm going to beat you.
- Oh, no, you're not.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.382
No, mm, mm, mm.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.217
- Hey.
Hey. Sorry.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.218
I had a thing
I couldn't get out of.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.653
- No worries.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.321
- So, uh, let's
play this back.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.123
Where's the guy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll get him.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.262
- Hey.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.998
- Yeah.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.567
- I'm sorry.
I don't think...

31:41.600 --> 31:44.070
I don't think
I can do this right now.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.638
I really like you,
but I don't think I can deal

31:46.672 --> 31:50.476
with everybody being
so involved in our business.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.145
You know, like I've had
people talk about me before,

31:53.179 --> 31:54.981
and it's never been good.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.649
- Look, look. I get it.
All right?

31:57.683 --> 32:00.086
Believe me, it's not
fun for me, either.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.255
You know, I just--I don't want
to be the guy who complains

32:03.289 --> 32:05.057
about how hard it is
to be famous, you know.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.425
I just--I don't know.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.595
I just try to look at it as
like that's the price

32:09.628 --> 32:12.198
for all the amazing things
in my life.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.001
Then I meet someone like you.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.369
And I just--I want
to get to know you

32:17.403 --> 32:19.171
without anyone watching.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.672
- I wish we could.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.609
- So then just
give me a chance.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.711
I'll find a way
to make it happen.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.116
- I have ideas.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.290
- Hey.
Did Cadence go down already?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.326
- Yeah. About an hour ago.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.294
- We had the most
incredible communal dinner.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.663
People just
told their stories.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.466
I had a long conversation
with Darius,

32:47.499 --> 32:50.469
and I think I can do this.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.005
I really think
I can make a change.

32:53.039 --> 32:56.275
- What kind of change
are we talking about?

32:56.308 --> 32:58.144
- Confronting my problems.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.278
On a deep level.

32:59.311 --> 33:03.349
So I can be a better partner,
I can be a better mom.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.718
I've really been trying.
- I know.

33:06.752 --> 33:12.091
And I see how hard
you're working on yourself,

33:12.124 --> 33:15.261
and I'm really proud
of you for that. I am.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.730
You need me to do it your way?

33:18.764 --> 33:21.267
Go back to rehab because
let me--let me tell ya,

33:21.300 --> 33:22.734
it did not work.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.270
- I'm not--I'm not saying
you have to do it my way.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.206
But it's just you're--

33:27.239 --> 33:30.542
you're putting all of
your trust into this guy.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.211
You're spending all
of your time there,

33:32.244 --> 33:34.546
you're living your
whole life by his words.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.083
- Did you even give
him a chance?

33:37.116 --> 33:38.450
Or did you just decide
this was wrong

33:38.484 --> 33:40.086
because you
don't understand it?

33:40.119 --> 33:43.255
- I've done nothing
but give this a chance.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.824
I've bitten my tongue every time
I got a weird vibe off of him.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.694
I mean, that's how bad
I want to support you.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.197
- Oh, honey, you can
say you support me

33:51.230 --> 33:53.799
until the cows come home,
but I feel it when you don't.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.402
I don't know if
this is because

33:56.435 --> 33:58.237
you feel threatened by him

33:58.270 --> 34:01.607
or maybe you're just
so used to me leaning on you.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.542
- You seriously
think that's why?

34:06.312 --> 34:09.115
- Just think what you want.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.549
You will anyway.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.386
- To bed.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.438
- Laura and the other
folks are volunteering

34:32.471 --> 34:34.173
at the building site again.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.676
And if you have a problem
with me going, that is fine.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.546
Okay?
Honor your feelings.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.448
But I'm going.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.849
I'll be back tonight.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.418
Maybe then you'll be
less mad at me.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.690
I'm just worried about you.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.259
- Don't be.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.742
- Will, I asked you
to come back in

35:10.776 --> 35:14.646
because your tests showed
some unusual hormone levels.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.448
- Oh, yeah.

35:16.482 --> 35:20.386
I've been taking
a little human growth hormone.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.654
Just to supplement my workouts.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.556
A ton of guys
at the gym take it.

35:24.590 --> 35:28.227
- I'm sure they are, but that's
not all you're taking.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.161
- Uh...

35:31.663 --> 35:34.400
I was taking some steroids,
but I stopped.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.834
- Well, they're still
in your system.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.404
You've got to stop now.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.907
I can help you with a plan to
get your body regulated again.

35:43.642 --> 35:47.346
- Okay. I get it.
I do.

35:54.786 --> 35:58.924
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.759
- Is it okay that
I just came over?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.194
I mean, is Jake still--

36:02.228 --> 36:04.496
- No, he's at his dad's.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.599
- I just--I felt awful about
what happened on the phone.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.835
- You don't have
to say anything.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.538
- Well, it's what
I didn't say, Jessie.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.840
Truth is, Daphne's fine.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.608
Or she's going to be.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.610
It's me. I'm the one
who's freaking out.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.480
I'm walking around with
a piece of me gone,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.250
and I don't want
to wreck this thing,

36:24.283 --> 36:25.651
but I don't know how I can't.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.687
Would that take some
of the pressure off?

36:28.720 --> 36:30.556
- Yeah, it might.
Could we do it that way?

36:30.589 --> 36:32.491
- Yeah.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.495
- Look, Deacon, I understand
if you're not ready

36:36.528 --> 36:37.563
and that's totally fine.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.964
I just need you
to tell me that,

36:38.997 --> 36:40.966
because it's the back
and forth really that's--

36:40.999 --> 36:42.534
- Look all I know--
- --that's killing me, you know.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.902
- --is that when you hung up
on my today,

36:43.935 --> 36:45.637
it was like the floor
fell out from under me.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.544
So, no I don't think
I want it to end,

36:52.578 --> 36:54.012
but if you need something--

36:54.045 --> 36:56.415
- Shut up.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.284
- Yeah.
Just shut up.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.843
Daph, what's wrong?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.678
- Nothing, nothing.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.848
- You wouldn't understand.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.951
- Okay, maybe not,
but I'll always listen.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.787
- How are you so okay
with him dating her?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.391
- It's not that
I'm okay with it.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.427
I just--I don't want him
to be lonely.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.962
- No, of course I don't.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.300
- You can't tell him
I said anything.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.703
Maddie.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.905
Okay, I won't.
I promise.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.811
- I meant what I said

37:59.845 --> 38:02.781
about me
wanting him to be happy.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.353
But I hate this.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.554
And I hate her.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.625
Now I just...

38:13.659 --> 38:15.661
really feel
like mom's gone.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.732
- It's okay.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.746
- * I give up

38:34.780 --> 38:38.517
* Come and find me

38:38.550 --> 38:41.687
* Am I lost

38:41.720 --> 38:44.656
* Or am I hiding

38:44.690 --> 38:48.627
* I disappear

38:48.660 --> 38:52.631
* And wind up here

38:52.664 --> 38:55.867
* Come and find me

38:59.405 --> 39:02.741
* I see you

39:02.774 --> 39:05.877
* And I'm trying *

39:05.911 --> 39:09.648
* To come back

39:09.681 --> 39:12.651
* From where I've been *

39:12.684 --> 39:16.522
* But I don't know *

39:16.555 --> 39:19.958
* The way back home

39:19.991 --> 39:22.728
* Come and find me

39:29.801 --> 39:33.138
* I'm no runaway *

39:33.171 --> 39:37.075
* This is just a game I play

39:39.878 --> 39:43.415
* I want you to find me

39:43.449 --> 39:47.085
* I think I've gone too far *

39:47.118 --> 39:51.590
* Please don't
leave me in the dark *

39:55.093 --> 39:57.095
- Oh, sorry.
- Dammit, Gunnar.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.830
- I didn't realize
you were here.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.699
What's that?

40:00.732 --> 40:04.102
- Just a little
human growth hormone.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.838
Takes a little help
to look this good.

40:06.872 --> 40:11.677
- Wow, I didn't realize it
worked like that.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.712
I hate needles.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.915
I kinda gotta concentrate here.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.894
- * I'm no runaway *

40:28.927 --> 40:32.731
* This is just a game I play

40:35.100 --> 40:38.904
* And I want you to find me

40:38.937 --> 40:40.005
* I think I've gone too far *

40:40.038 --> 40:41.573
- I give up.
Where are we?

40:41.607 --> 40:43.542
- The last place that
anyone would ever look.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.712
* Please don't
leave me in the dark *

40:48.747 --> 40:50.682
- Come here, come here.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.687
- I've been invited
here to this center

40:55.721 --> 40:59.725
for equine therapy that helps
troubled teens deal with
trauma.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.693
We'll have more on
this incredible program

41:01.727 --> 41:03.061
coming up after the break.

41:05.564 --> 41:09.701
- * Oh

41:12.303 --> 41:17.108
* Oh

41:20.846 --> 41:24.249
* I'm no runaway *

41:24.282 --> 41:28.654
* This is just a game I play

41:30.889 --> 41:34.893
* I want you to find me

41:34.926 --> 41:38.196
* I think I've gone too far *

41:38.229 --> 41:42.868
* Please don't
leave me in the dark *

41:46.071 --> 41:49.641
* Come and find me

41:52.978 --> 41:56.582
* Come and find me
