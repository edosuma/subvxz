00:21.187 --> 00:22.484
Damn.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.782
All right,
we gotta get an official word here.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.658
Amy's been eliminated?

00:26.826 --> 00:32.389
Ladies and gentlemen,
Amy has been eliminated.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.462
We are down to Honey Moore,
37D-25-30-

00:38.138 --> 00:42.575
- Oh, gosh.
- Hey, April. What are you doing?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.644
- How does this feel?
- It feels good.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.650
Did you come yet?

00:52.819 --> 00:55.754
- I was going to, but...
- Yeah?

00:56.589 --> 01:00.491
I thought you did before,
you know, and then...

01:03.396 --> 01:04.420
Should I keep going?

01:05.031 --> 01:06.498
Do you want to keep going?

01:07.333 --> 01:10.496
Oh, yeah, I- Yeah, I-
You know I always want to.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.399
I'm okay if you want to take a break.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.336
I'm hard, so- I didn't know
if we should come back to this.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.635
- That works.
- Yeah.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.040
- Well, let's take a break.
- Okay.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.546
So I'm gonna give it
a couple more pumps and then-

01:23.716 --> 01:27.618
- Okay.
- So three, two, one.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.696
- Nice. That's great.
- Thank you.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.662
How you do this?
Just, like, a VCR and, like, your camcorder?

01:40.833 --> 01:43.495
No, no.
See, I have a system on my computer.

01:43.670 --> 01:47.231
It's a non-linear digital software,
and it's got all these great fades...

01:47.407 --> 01:50.604
-... and wipes and you can see I can add-
- Yeah, I get it, computers.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.268
I am really proud of this.
And I'm proud of you too.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.574
- Sober and ready-
- Sober, ready, okay, this is good.

01:57.016 --> 02:00.816
You know what?
I want this by Monday on the desk...

02:00.987 --> 02:04.150
...of every single pro scout
in the Southeast, all right?

02:04.324 --> 02:07.293
Fuck the West up the butt hole,
they get nothing.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.190
You could do some shots of you,
like, smoking weed.

02:10.363 --> 02:14.663
Clegg, this is to get back into the majors. Me
sitting around smoking weed is awesome...

02:14.834 --> 02:18.133
...but it's not gonna be what
a team manager is gonna be looking for.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.796
- They don't have to know it's weed.
- Then what the fuck would you do it for?

02:21.975 --> 02:25.274
- Or it could be like a-
- No, dude, you want to see animal sounds...

02:25.445 --> 02:29.779
...throwing the ball, a dude cutting trees
like he's a force to be reckoned with.

02:29.949 --> 02:31.940
Shouldn't you show more, like-?

02:32.118 --> 02:34.518
Since you're trying to
get your pitching job back...

02:34.687 --> 02:37.417
-... more of you pitching?
- There was a pitch shot in there.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.150
There was the one where
the ball blew up in the hand.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.921
- That's showing the pitching.
- Right here, this is my favorite part.

02:44.097 --> 02:50.263
"Powers is coming back fucking soon. "

02:53.239 --> 02:54.831
You bet.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.970
That is good. That's real good.
Clegg, you got my shit?

03:01.547 --> 03:03.139
Oh, yeah.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.220
Why is it in a Ziploc bag?
Are these mushrooms?

03:10.556 --> 03:14.083
- Clegg, I'm talking about fucking steroids.
- My bad.

04:00.373 --> 04:01.863
God. Fuck.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.010
Stevie, goddamn it,
eyes are going AWOL, man.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.339
The kid in the striped shirt,
he's staring at me.

04:07.513 --> 04:12.541
Hey, loser! Eyes fucking down!
Have some respect for Coach Powers!

04:12.719 --> 04:15.119
Gosh, you're all making me so mad!

04:15.288 --> 04:19.952
What are you laughing at, Sarah?
What are you laughing at?

04:20.125 --> 04:24.460
I have tried to be your friend,
but you will not listen to me...

04:24.630 --> 04:27.463
...so you invited this monster.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.863
- Don't make me kill somebody!
- Thank you.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.563
Mr. Janowski,
what an interesting speech.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.699
What's going on out here? You gentlemen
teaching a joint class out here or...?

04:37.877 --> 04:39.811
What kind of a thing are we doing here?

04:40.713 --> 04:43.045
- Yeah. May I point something out to you?
- Well...

04:43.216 --> 04:45.776
Your band class
appears to be missing their instruments.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.080
We're teaching them the curveball.
I don't see what the big deal is.

04:49.255 --> 04:53.487
Oh, no, that's a perfect thing for you to be
sharing with your physical-education class.

04:53.659 --> 04:54.819
That makes perfect sense.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.327
My concern is over here.
I guess I just don't really understand...

04:58.498 --> 05:01.296
...where Mr. Janowski's class
needs to be out here right now.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.901
You don't have to understand
my class. It's my class.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.732
- Okay. Settle down, Mr. Janowski. Settle-
- It's my class.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.999
It wasn't my idea
to make music a requirement.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.609
This stuff is classic
private conversation stuff.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.581
Relax. Kenny's not going anywhere.
You can see your friend after school.

05:15.748 --> 05:19.445
Whoa, whoa, what the hell does that mean?
"Kenny's not going anywhere. "

05:19.886 --> 05:23.083
Well, I'm sorry, did I miss it?
Did the majors call today?

05:24.757 --> 05:26.657
I'm busting your chops, fella.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.294
Come on. Lighten up a little bit, will you?

05:29.462 --> 05:31.362
- That's not funny.
- It's pretty funny.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.056
All right, Mr. Janowski, please,
get your class inside.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.962
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

05:36.135 --> 05:39.434
Fine. Everybody inside. Everybody inside.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.869
- Very good.
- I don't tell you how to principal...

05:42.041 --> 05:44.601
...I don't think you should tell me
how to teach band.

05:44.777 --> 05:48.440
You clearly don't understand
the employer-employee relationship.

05:48.614 --> 05:52.573
I guess I'm starting to and I don't like it.
I'll see you later, Kenny.

05:52.752 --> 05:56.017
I'm concerned about him sometimes.
I don't know if it's a great idea...

05:56.189 --> 05:58.453
...for you to be spending so much time
with Mr. Janowski.

05:58.624 --> 06:02.082
Are we done here?
Because I'm ready to get back to educating.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.957
I wonder if it might be better
if they could see you.

06:05.131 --> 06:08.123
- This is perfectly fine for the lesson, so just-
- Okay.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.201
I know you don't like to be observed.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.837
Hey, but you're coming to the barbecue,
aren't you?

06:13.005 --> 06:14.029
- Barbecue?
- Yeah.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.238
This weekend at my house.
You don't know about this?

06:17.410 --> 06:21.005
April and I are having some friends over.
It's gonna be casual, nothing crazy.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.946
You know, we'll probably play some
Pictionary or something like that, you know?

06:25.117 --> 06:27.108
Gosh.
Yeah, it's gonna be a real good party.

06:27.286 --> 06:31.552
I'm getting excited the more I talk about it.
April didn't tell you? I told her to tell you.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.387
No, she didn't tell me.
Must have slipped her mind.

06:37.330 --> 06:41.130
I really like the hues.
Orange and red for the sunshine.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.667
- It gives the contrast of a nice blue sky.
- Beat it, Kyle.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.065
Oh, no, that's it.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.470
See? Exactly.
That's what I'm talking about.

06:49.642 --> 06:55.080
Okay, now trace just along the line.
That's why we use a pencil.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.782
- Okay, go on.
- Oh, hey, Coach Powers.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.851
What's up, Deshauna?

07:01.754 --> 07:04.689
- Can I help you, Kenny?
- I don't know, can you?

07:04.857 --> 07:07.917
Why don't you start by trying to tell me
what you were supposed to?

07:08.094 --> 07:11.086
Are you sure this isn't something
that can maybe wait till later?

07:11.264 --> 07:15.166
For what? So that you can just not say
the thing you're supposed to tell me?

07:16.068 --> 07:17.330
What are you talking about?

07:17.503 --> 07:20.768
BBQ, your house. You didn't invite me.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.108
- Oh.
- Yeah, "Oh. "

07:24.277 --> 07:27.246
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.381
I forgot.

07:30.182 --> 07:33.208
You're invited. It's on Saturday.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.217
Come if you feel you need to.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.516
I already was invited,
by your new boyfriend.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.057
And I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told him:

07:41.227 --> 07:45.789
I ain't going. You can keep your stupid
invitation. I got better shit on my tray.

07:45.965 --> 07:50.299
I just came down here to let you know
that I know you're backstabbing me...

07:50.469 --> 07:52.801
...and that is super fucked up.

07:57.877 --> 07:58.935
He was just kidding.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.266
I mean, seriously, how dare her.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.597
So she forgot to invite you.
Why would you want to go anyway?

08:24.770 --> 08:26.237
Seems like it would be awkward.

08:26.405 --> 08:29.602
No, it's not about it being awkward,
it's about testing the waters...

08:29.775 --> 08:32.208
...and seeing if there's a chance
for us to go at it.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.438
She's not giving herself the
opportunity to see if this would work.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.082
You know, maybe she already knows
it's not gonna work.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.549
- She's getting married to someone else.
- No, she doesn't know shit.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.452
Sitting here, waving around her cervix
like it's the hottest ticket in town.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.751
Stupid cookout.

08:46.926 --> 08:50.259
As if their fucking cookout
is any sort of big thing.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.523
Dumb.
You should see my fucking cookouts, man.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.030
When I was back in Seattle...

08:55.201 --> 08:58.693
...I had the goddamn Spoonman from
the Soundgarden videos coming to my shit.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.929
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

09:00.106 --> 09:04.475
I'm talking six grills burning at all times.
Tiki torches, three whole pigs...

09:04.644 --> 09:07.807
...fucking shitloads of macaroni
and cheeses, baked potatoes...

09:07.980 --> 09:09.538
...collard greens, a horse...

09:09.715 --> 09:13.276
...fucking Puerto Rican chicks showing their
pussies and tits off everywhere.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.819
- They were amazing.
- That sounds like a hell of a cookout.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.923
Yeah, you bet your ass they were.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.652
My cookouts smoke her
stupid little dumb backyard...

09:22.828 --> 09:25.729
...principal-having cookout shit.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.483
- Are you ready?
- No, I'm not ready. What did I tell you?

09:53.659 --> 09:54.990
I said put something nice on.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.652
You look like a busted
Daytona stripper in that shit.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.957
Fuck you, this is my evening wear.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.828
I don't want no pussy-getting-wet
dresses for this cookout.

10:03.002 --> 10:07.530
This needs to be a normal evening outfit
that regular people would wear.

10:07.707 --> 10:11.143
I'm walking into a fucking hornet's nest,
all right? Now, be my companion.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.904
I need you to make me
help them be jealous of me.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.516
I know you're not a natural beauty,
but with the right clothes and look...

10:17.683 --> 10:20.584
-... you could be very striking.
- And what the fuck do you know?

10:20.753 --> 10:24.314
Oh, what do I know? I know that one of us
had their own personal stylist...

10:24.490 --> 10:28.051
...and one of us shoplifts their shit
from Fashion Bug. That's what I know.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.757
- Now, what else you got?
- Hold on.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.660
Christ almighty.

10:34.100 --> 10:38.161
Okay, this- This you're gonna like.
We got this...

10:38.337 --> 10:40.771
Honey, I love you,
I think you're a terrific girl...

10:40.940 --> 10:43.306
...but you have clothes
like a fucking dickhead.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.249
Hey.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.523
Hey, Stevie. Glad you made it.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.927
Hey, I would not miss a party.

11:07.099 --> 11:10.227
- I brought eggs.
- Oh, great.

11:10.402 --> 11:12.393
Thank you.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.433
Now, did you come alone or...?

11:14.607 --> 11:19.237
Yeah, I-
I thought it was just gonna be VIPs, but it-

11:19.411 --> 11:23.040
It's not VIPs. You could have
brought somebody if you wanted to.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.275
I was wondering, who are some of these
motherfuckers at this party?

11:26.452 --> 11:28.943
I don't recognize a lot of them.

11:29.121 --> 11:33.023
Well, Stevie,
these motherfuckers are the church group.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.492
- Yeah.
- The church group.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.528
The church group,
our Wednesday night fellowship group.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.564
Also, the school people
that you will know, everybody.

11:41.734 --> 11:45.465
You're not gonna know
Cutler's triathlon people.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.231
Well, that's okay.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.137
Kenny will be here and he likes
to hang out with me, so...

11:51.310 --> 11:52.868
Kenny's coming?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.036
Just come on. Just walk. Come on.

11:55.214 --> 11:59.207
Oh, well, look at this.
Kenny Powers, you made it.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.853
And who is this lovely lady
that you've got with you?

12:02.021 --> 12:04.751
- Lovely? Her?
- Don't be so fucking rude.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.552
- Cutler, this is Tracy. Tracy, Cutler.
- Hi, how are you?

12:07.726 --> 12:09.956
He's my boss,
so don't try to suck him off.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.825
Come on. Just call me Terrence, okay?

12:12.998 --> 12:16.490
Hey, look, I'm making my famous
pumpkin margarita as an honor of fall.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.001
What do you say,
should we dive in? Have some fun?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.071
- Let's do this shit.
- Let's have some fun.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.868
You look like you're ready to have fun.

12:25.778 --> 12:29.043
Yo, Kenny, this party fucking sucks, man.

12:29.215 --> 12:33.208
Tell me about it. For a minute I thought I
was gonna have to face these jackals alone.

12:33.385 --> 12:37.321
You and me are the only cool people here.
Everybody here is just a bunch of posers...

12:37.489 --> 12:41.118
...and ho's and shitheads.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.289
You seen April?

12:43.762 --> 12:46.094
She's over there
with those fucking bitches.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.997
Look at her. Flaunting her fancy
fucking friends around...

12:51.170 --> 12:54.230
...trying to make me jealous. Pathetic.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.067
Hey, Kenny, I got an idea.

12:56.508 --> 12:58.476
Let's take this party to phase two.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.546
Cutler's got a plasma inside.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.574
Let's have a big-ass fucking screening
up in this shit right here, huh?

13:05.751 --> 13:07.480
I think that's cool as shit.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.952
Do it so it doesn't look like it was my idea.
Push it hard.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.789
Sounds good.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.153
What the fuck are you wearing?

13:15.327 --> 13:20.822
All black, man. So I can express my rage.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.934
I'm wearing all black.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.271
Yeah, it's a coincidence. It's pretty cool.

13:27.439 --> 13:30.465
I don't like it.
Find a way to change yourself from me.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.908
Change myself?
These are the only clothes I got.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.438
That's not my problem.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.251
- I shaved my beard.
- That was a big change for you.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.513
- Fucking retard.
- It was.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.486
Act- Fucking act straight.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.855
Hot kind of pepper.
I've lost a few pounds-

13:49.028 --> 13:50.256
You lose a few pounds-

13:51.597 --> 13:53.656
- Decent cookout, April.
- Yeah.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.665
I don't believe you've met
my fuck buddy, Tracy.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.962
She's actually
a professional runway model.

13:59.138 --> 14:03.268
She's also a very,
very famous painter in France.

14:03.442 --> 14:07.037
Yep, she has several works of fine art
hanging up in the "Louvre. "

14:07.212 --> 14:10.147
- Didn't we go to middle school together?
- No, that's impossible.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.284
She went to middle school
inside of France.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.646
Excuse me,
can I have everybody's attention?

14:14.820 --> 14:18.278
I just want to let you know that there's
going to be a special screening...

14:18.457 --> 14:21.187
...inside, around the TV, in ten minutes.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.818
So you can bring your drinks
in ten minutes for the screening.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.989
- Thank you.
- Okay, why is Stevie naked?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.293
He's half-naked.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.732
I think he must just be
having a really good time.

14:31.904 --> 14:35.237
I wonder what this screening could be,
though. That sounds entertaining.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.240
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

14:38.410 --> 14:42.904
You are about to see the most
exciting promotional video...

14:43.082 --> 14:46.518
-... that you have ever seen in your life.
- Uh-oh, what's this?

14:46.685 --> 14:49.017
Conan the Destroyer
or Hunt for Red October?

14:49.188 --> 14:50.815
It's a good movie I put on.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.652
Stevie, these people
don't wanna see this little show.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.316
I think they might.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.559
- Let's watch this.
- Making the necessary adjustments.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.599
Massive popularity
takes a lot of hard work.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.863
How do you know Kenny?

15:05.037 --> 15:06.402
You know, I met him at a bar.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.097
I used to watch him on TV,
then I saw him at a bar...

15:09.274 --> 15:12.209
...and the next thing you know,
I'm sucking his dick on a desk.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.541
Some people have a wall between
their thoughts and their words...

15:15.714 --> 15:17.648
...you don't have it. I'm enjoying it.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.580
So you're the principal, huh?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.347
Yup, that's me.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.220
- You ever spank anybody?
- No, I can't do that.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.121
The school board frowns on that.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.694
Hey, you know what, though?
I do have a paddle. I have a big-

15:31.864 --> 15:33.024
This big wooden paddle.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.832
Can I see it?

15:36.035 --> 15:40.836
I'm a fan of big, hard wood.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.699
- Like that.
- That didn't happen for real.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.675
There was not really real fire
explosions when I hit the bag.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.371
- Good effect.
- We discovered through market research...

15:50.549 --> 15:52.983
...that technology
is the way to the media's heart.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.176
You bet.

15:54.353 --> 15:57.186
- That's why I pieced all this together.
- I don't get it.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.347
If you can call it that.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.119
- Everyone just listen. Watch this.
- No talking.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.457
Actions speak louder than words.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.226
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.233
Making the necessary adjustments.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.399
Don't be crazy, don't be lazy.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.008
Hire Kenny Powers.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.884
- Boo.
- What are you doing in my bedroom?

16:31.056 --> 16:34.116
You mean, besides creeping around in here
like some kind of rapist?

16:34.293 --> 16:37.057
- Yeah.
- I just wanted to talk to you for a second.

16:37.229 --> 16:40.221
Just- You know,
I came here because this is your house...

16:40.399 --> 16:44.199
...and I haven't even gotten a chance
to even score any solo time with you, so...

16:45.270 --> 16:47.761
Kenny,
what are you doing in my bedroom?

16:49.007 --> 16:50.668
You know what I'm doing here.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.522
- Fuck me.
- I want you.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.163
I want you.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.643
Oh, fuck yeah.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.407
Oh, God. Oh, God, Oh, God.

17:33.585 --> 17:38.955
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.125
- We shouldn't do this.
- Did you ejaculate?

17:42.294 --> 17:45.730
No, this is moving too fast. I just
got back into town and you're engaged.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.593
We shouldn't do this.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.924
- This is a mistake.
- No, it's not a mistake.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.900
April,
it's just that your feelings are on the line.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.103
Fuck.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.279
Fuck.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.921
Oh, who did that?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.885
Another round coming up.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.321
Principal Cutler. I gotta tell you, sir...

18:14.493 --> 18:16.984
-... I am impressed.
- Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.

18:17.162 --> 18:21.292
I'm gonna have to order you to slow down
because you are causing a scene right now.

18:21.466 --> 18:23.866
You know what?
You're not the boss of me.

18:24.036 --> 18:28.097
No, I'm not your boss, but Kenny is and I'm
more important than you in Kenny's life...

18:28.273 --> 18:32.937
-... that means I can tell you what to do.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

18:34.513 --> 18:38.142
- Terrence?
- Oh, no. Here comes the fun police.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.946
Put down your fun and stop having fun
or you'll go to fun jail.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.712
What are you doing?

18:43.889 --> 18:46.824
I'm just entertaining some of our guests.
We're just having fun.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.254
Is that a problem, cupcake?

18:48.427 --> 18:50.827
Okay, you know what?
I think that you've had enough.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.088
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:52.264 --> 18:55.097
Maybe you should shut the fuck up.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.333
It's a party!

19:00.305 --> 19:02.967
Damn it, Stevie,
why the fuck did you let Tracy get drunk?

19:03.141 --> 19:05.609
- I am sorry, Kenny. I'm sorry.
- You should be.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.870
Tracy, put your shirt on
and get in the truck.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.641
- Why don't you shut the fuck up, Kenny?
- Hey, he said get in the truck, bitch.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.911
Get in the fucking truck. Get in the truck.

19:16.488 --> 19:20.857
- Get in the...
- That's it. God. Calm down, that's it.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.518
Party's over. That's it. Party's over.
It's not funny, Cutler. Party's done.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.891
- Party's over.
- What's the matter, Mr. All Star?

19:27.065 --> 19:29.260
Having a hard time
keeping your people together?

19:29.434 --> 19:32.028
You gotta get your retard crew in order.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.637
Don't mock me.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.468
Terrence, I think we need to call it a day
before things get rude.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.508
It's a day.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.539
Hey, hey. Lower the tone, Cutler.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.877
- Seriously, dog. Take it down a notch.
- Oh, okay.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.543
I'll take it down a notch, because
the mighty Kenny Powers wants me to.

19:49.721 --> 19:53.088
I'll do whatever you say. K. P. at the bat.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.489
Take me out to the ball- Hey, get me some
peanuts and Cracker Jacks.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.495
- You know what? That's it.
- Get me some fucking peanuts.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.929
- Terrence, that is it.
- Beer here.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.091
- Party's over. Sit down.
- What's the matter?

20:04.269 --> 20:06.100
- Throw us a curveball.
- You don't smoke.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.398
- I got your fucking curveball right here.
- Sit.

20:08.573 --> 20:11.041
I would punch you in your face
if you weren't my boss.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.439
Yeah, well, I am your boss.

20:13.612 --> 20:17.013
You work for me now
because you are jack shit now.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.811
I'm not.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.884
Obviously he's just had
too much to drink tonight.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.116
I don't know what he was trying to say.
He's playing with his dick.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.623
Oh, my-

20:28.794 --> 20:31.695
He said you work for him now
because you're jack shit.

20:31.863 --> 20:35.355
I know what he said. You don't have to
fucking repeat it, all right?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.560
Goddamn it.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.576
I'm just gonna go ahead and go now.

21:44.002 --> 21:45.060
Yo!

21:46.204 --> 21:48.104
Hey!

22:07.592 --> 22:10.356
So in closing,
I'd like to give big ups to God...

22:10.529 --> 22:12.622
...Buddha, L. Ron, whoever.

22:12.798 --> 22:16.165
Hell, maybe I just need to thank me.
If there's one thing I've learned...

22:16.334 --> 22:20.998
...through all my adventures and conquests,
it's that some people are wired for success.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.266
I had no choice
when it came to being great.

22:23.442 --> 22:24.500
I just am great.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.144
And I'm not trying to sound
cocky or full of myself...

22:27.312 --> 22:29.439
...but Kenny Powers
has a sneaking suspicion...

22:29.614 --> 22:32.947
...that no matter what comes his way,
he will always be great.

22:33.118 --> 22:36.315
Because that's just the way
shit works sometimes.

22:36.922 --> 22:41.621
This has been based on a true story.
The motherfucking end.

22:41.793 --> 22:42.987
You've reached the end of:

22:43.161 --> 22:47.621
You're Fucking Out, I'm Fucking In,
read by Kenny Powers.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.948
I'm sad, Dustin.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.918
I'm super, super sad.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.254
Like, big-time sad.

23:18.129 --> 23:22.725
It's like, for the life of me,
I can't catch a fucking break.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.530
I mean, at a certain point, I mean,
what the fuck am I supposed to do?

23:27.506 --> 23:29.497
I don't know, man.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.936
I don't know what's going on, man.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.705
I'm just all jammed up inside.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.212
Lost my abilities.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.750
Been stripped of all my God-given talents.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.848
Including the talents to be able to have sex
with any woman I choose...

23:46.024 --> 23:52.395
...or to throw a fucking ball fast,
or to not prematurely come in my pants.

23:53.999 --> 23:57.765
Sometimes I just don't even know
which one hurts the most.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.332
I'm ashamed of myself.

24:01.606 --> 24:06.566
Well, sometimes you just gotta
see what happens.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.746
Just be strong, man.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.780
I know, dude. I am strong.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.514
Just go back inside.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.716
- You sure?
- Yes, Dustin, just go inside.

24:19.891 --> 24:22.155
If that's your only advice
is to just be strong...

24:22.327 --> 24:25.125
...Jesus Christ,
I could talk to the fucking rock out here...

24:25.297 --> 24:28.061
...it'd probably tell me something
more useful than that.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.559
Are you crying, Kenny?

24:29.734 --> 24:31.201
I'm not crying, Dustin.

24:31.369 --> 24:35.237
It's just this stupid pollen, it's in my eyes
and making them fucking water.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.570
Just go away from me, Dustin.

25:41.072 --> 25:44.371
Jesus, Kenny,
what the hell's going on down there?

25:44.809 --> 25:46.401
Kenny!
