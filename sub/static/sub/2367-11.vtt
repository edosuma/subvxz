00:25.358 --> 00:26.359
[thud]

00:31.406 --> 00:33.366
We need a doctor! Now!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.327
Let's get a gurney out here!

00:36.244 --> 00:37.955
-What happened?
-She drank something.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.540
What did she ingest?
I need you to be specific.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.710
[Wesley] I have no idea. It was at the
Van Lunt building, the benefit.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.836
There were others...

00:43.919 --> 00:46.880
Uh, I had a glass in my hand.
Do I need to be checked out?

00:46.964 --> 00:48.215
[doctor] How long's
she been unconscious?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
[Wesley] Twenty minutes.
Maybe a little longer.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.051
Place is a rat hole.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.344
It was the closest ER.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.137
I reached out to Dr. Rosenberg.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.472
He's on the jet.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.557
[doctor] Pupils are sluggish.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.641
I need an intubation tray, stat!

00:57.725 --> 00:59.810
Let's start 1,000 cc's
of Ringer's lactate to KVO

00:59.893 --> 01:00.978
until we know what's going on.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.481
Insert a Foley catheter...
[continues indistinctly]

01:04.565 --> 01:07.025
-Hemodialysis and gastric lavage?
-I need a tox screen,

01:07.109 --> 01:09.111
liver and kidney function,
coagulation tests.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.195
I'll call ICU for a bed.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.404
You said there were others,
how many?

01:11.488 --> 01:14.116
Uh, four or five maybe.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.119
Are you sure someone
shouldn't be looking at me?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.579
We'll have a nurse
come check you out.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.830
-I'm coming with her.
-I'm sorry,

01:19.913 --> 01:20.956
we can't have you in there, sir.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.708
-[yelling] Don't you know who I am?
-Doesn't matter.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.167
Fill out the paperwork.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.630
We'll update you on her condition
as soon as we know anything.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.621
Matt, it's Karen.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.375
Come on, open the door.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.463
I can't get a hold of Foggy
and there's nobody at the office.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.881
What the hell is going on?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.427
Matt...

02:57.510 --> 02:59.262
[door unlocking]

03:03.350 --> 03:04.601
Oh, my God.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.939
You look like shit.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.818
Then I'm looking
better than I feel.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.989
We gonna sue?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.827
We should sue.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.455
You know, whoever hit you,
we should go after 'em and...

03:27.540 --> 03:28.751
What kind of car was it?

03:30.127 --> 03:33.964
Please tell me it was, uh,
expensive and German.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.008
[sighs] Japanese...

03:36.091 --> 03:37.675
and it was my fault.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.637
I, uh...
should have been more careful.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.597
What the hell happened in here?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.725
Nothing, don't worry about it.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.102
Oh, okay, I'll just, uh...

03:50.272 --> 03:51.899
Little early for beer, isn't it?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.485
Depends on the kind of day you're having.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.862
You, uh... you want one?

03:57.487 --> 03:59.197
Uh, no. No, thanks.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.033
So where were you...

04:01.116 --> 04:02.868
when this car hit you?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.578
Uh, does it matter?

04:07.122 --> 04:09.082
I'm thinking it might...

04:10.125 --> 04:11.459
if there really wasn't any car.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.712
-[groans] Karen--
-Does this have anything to do with Fisk?

04:14.797 --> 04:17.841
With your going to see that...
Vanessa woman?

04:17.925 --> 04:18.926
I told you, it was my fault.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.761
-Let's just leave it at that, okay?
-No.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.806
No, not okay.
Definitely not okay.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.723
Look at you.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.560
-Did somebody break in?
-No one broke in.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.604
And no one beat the crap
out of you either, I'm guessing.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.898
[sighs]

04:37.360 --> 04:40.030
Do you remember
the last time that I was here?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.407
Yeah, I remember.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.952
And I was scared... terrified.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.079
But then, you,
you gave me your shirt...

04:47.162 --> 04:48.163
and you made me feel safe.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.708
You made me feel like I could trust
everything that you said.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.460
And you lied to me...

04:53.543 --> 04:55.087
[scoffs]

04:55.170 --> 04:57.505
...about having
the Union Allied pension file.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.550
I didn't want anyone to get hurt...

05:01.802 --> 05:02.845
like Daniel Fisher,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.762
because of what I was doing.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.599
[sighs] Yeah, I know the feeling.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.602
So that's it.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.813
That's all you're giving me.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.357
That's all that I have
right now, Karen.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.441
[groans]

05:17.901 --> 05:19.111
Well, it's not all I have.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.655
I found something.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.659
Just a scrap of paper at the
county clerk's office... misfiled.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.998
It's probably why Fisk didn't get it
sucked into a black hole.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.290
What was it?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.917
A marriage certificate...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.420
for his mother, Marlene.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.505
How does that help?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.132
Because it's not to his father.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.759
It's for when she remarried...

05:42.842 --> 05:45.720
which was two years after
all the reports say she died.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.014
She's still alive?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.349
Yeah, she's living
at a care facility upstate.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.393
Now, Ben and I took a drive--

05:51.476 --> 05:53.603
Oh, Karen, Karen...

05:53.686 --> 05:56.314
-Fisk could have people watching.
-I know.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.441
-I know. I didn't leave my real name.
-You should have--

05:58.525 --> 06:00.986
You should have talked to me or Foggy
before you ran off like that.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.779
I tried...

06:02.862 --> 06:04.072
but you weren't picking up.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.162
-Did you speak to her, Fisk's mother?
-Yeah...

06:10.245 --> 06:13.081
she's not all there, but...

06:13.165 --> 06:15.417
Matt, what she said about Fisk...

06:17.294 --> 06:18.836
he killed his father...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.256
when he was 12.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.428
Bashed his head in with a hammer,
and then she helped him cover it up.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.600
Well, he was a minor.
It's not gonna be enough.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.852
To put him in jail, no.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.855
But it doesn't line up with everything
that Fisk has been saying.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.857
Everything that he has
altered on the Internet

06:39.942 --> 06:42.235
and at the...
the county clerk's.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.197
It might be enough to at least get people
looking at him more closely.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.240
From an old woman
who's not all there.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.575
[scoffs]

06:48.658 --> 06:50.827
Well, I'm not hearing you and Foggy
come up with anything better.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.913
Did you...
did you speak to him...

06:53.997 --> 06:55.665
to Foggy?

06:55.748 --> 06:58.961
Not since yesterday on the phone
when I guess he was...

06:59.044 --> 07:02.130
covering for whatever it is
you're not telling me.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.219
All right, go to the office and...
wait for him.

07:07.302 --> 07:11.681
Tell him what you found, and Karen,
tell him... tell him that I said...

07:13.350 --> 07:14.684
[sighs]

07:14.767 --> 07:17.520
No, don't bother.
Just tell him what you found.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.108
Karen, be careful, please.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.159
You know...

07:34.204 --> 07:35.913
maybe you should take
your own advice.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.544
I... I got you a...

07:48.676 --> 07:50.053
It's, um...

07:51.429 --> 07:53.140
it's a balloon. I, um...

07:58.103 --> 07:59.312
It's got a monkey on it.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.489
[door closes]

08:15.870 --> 08:17.789
[cell phone ringing]

08:17.872 --> 08:19.457
[groans]

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
[Marci] You got somewhere to be?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.880
[grunting]

08:27.590 --> 08:31.011
You're not in the woods.
Grunts don't count as words, Foggy Bear.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.220
Please don't call me that.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.556
I'll call you whatever
I damn well please.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.640
Okay, just...

08:36.558 --> 08:39.102
can you do it with your inside voice,
without speaking?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.314
That's a very asshole thing to say.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.815
-I'm impressed.
-Sorry.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.858
And now you've ruined it.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.694
You going to work or what?

08:47.777 --> 08:50.488
Not today.
Maybe never, not with Matt.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.868
You two have been friends
as long as I've known you.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.040
Whatever's going on
between the two of you...

09:00.123 --> 09:01.499
I don't really care...

09:01.583 --> 09:03.000
okay?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.502
Not gonna get sucked into the drama.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.921
Mmm.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.924
Lock the door behind you
when you leave.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.176
[sighs]

09:12.135 --> 09:13.595
[door closes]

09:19.809 --> 09:21.186
[door opens]

09:37.410 --> 09:39.996
[Leland] This is awful.
Look at him.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.914
How's he gonna run things?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.127
Not the time, Leland.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.962
This is exactly the time.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.089
You keeping score here?

09:49.172 --> 09:51.591
You think whoever did this
was trying to take

09:51.674 --> 09:53.635
little miss hairdo
out of the equation?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.303
That--

09:55.387 --> 09:57.430
That does seem unlikely.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.681
So where does that put us?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.101
They almost got me, God damn it.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.437
All to get to the big guy,
Christ.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.566
Did Gao give any indication

10:08.650 --> 10:10.277
she was still unhappy
when you spoke with her?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.486
[scoffs]

10:11.569 --> 10:13.613
Not that I could tell.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.198
My money's on the Japanese.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.949
After what he did to Nobu--

10:17.033 --> 10:19.952
The titles for all the buildings
in the city block the Japanese wanted

10:20.036 --> 10:22.872
have been transferred to them,
per our original agreement.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.499
As for Nobu...

10:24.582 --> 10:28.085
they believe the man in the mask
was responsible for his... accident.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.381
Right, sure. Well...

10:31.464 --> 10:34.884
maybe he's the one who slipped
a hot dose into Vanessa's Bellini.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.846
Keep an eye on their accounts.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.767
If there are any sudden shifts,
it might tell us something.

10:42.850 --> 10:43.851
Yeah?

10:43.935 --> 10:45.353
[whispering]

10:49.232 --> 10:51.318
Thank you, Francis.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.988
What? What happened?
Is she dead?

10:56.072 --> 10:58.241
No, but...

10:58.325 --> 11:02.662
three of the others who drank
whatever that was have... passed.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.955
"Passed..."

11:04.872 --> 11:06.499
always hated that description.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.962
Such a sad attempt to avoid
the bare-knuckle truth.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.424
She'll make it.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.094
You got a med degree in your pocket
I don't know about?

11:18.177 --> 11:19.512
Why are you so sure?

11:19.596 --> 11:21.348
Because she has to.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.559
Don't get all weepy...

11:24.642 --> 11:28.104
we have matters
that need to be addressed.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.939
Hmm.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.692
Reach out to Gao.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.777
-Me?
-Mmm.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.946
What if she's the one
who did all this?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.656
Well, you said
you didn't think it was her.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.533
What the hell do I know?

11:40.617 --> 11:43.119
I was almost poisoned.
I'm not thinking straight.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.622
Speak with Gao...

11:45.705 --> 11:47.999
if she wasn't involved,

11:48.082 --> 11:51.378
we might need her support
against further unpleasantries.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.839
And if she was involved?

11:54.922 --> 11:58.134
Then it's been an honor
doing business with you.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.595
[clears throat]

12:00.678 --> 12:01.679
[Claire] This might hurt.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.017
-[groans]
-You okay?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.811
-You talking about the stitches?
-Mostly.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.356
How'd you open this up again?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
I just wanted to see
how much I could move.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.986
-You really shouldn't be moving at all.
-[quietly] I know.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.033
You really need to rest.
Let yourself heal.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.242
I meditate for that.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.577
You meditate?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.621
I learned when I was a kid.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.375
Helps with the pain...
and healing faster.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.001
Is that why you're still alive?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.087
Or I'm just a contrary son of a bitch.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.589
Either way,
you really need to ease up,

12:36.673 --> 12:39.592
or I'll be stitching a corpse
next time around.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.681
You really should get some kind of...
body armor, like I told you.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.142
-Yeah, I'm thinking you might be right.
-There's a first.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.395
When Fisk came at me
in the warehouse,

12:50.478 --> 12:52.397
I sliced his jacket open.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.357
-You cut him?
-No...

12:54.441 --> 12:57.402
he was wearing some kind of armor
in the lining.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.154
It was, uh...

13:00.237 --> 13:02.824
light and tough.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.702
Like nothing
I've ever come across before.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.246
That's what you get when you have
all the money in the world.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.420
Hey, you want a drink or something?

13:17.839 --> 13:19.173
No, Matt...

13:20.383 --> 13:21.759
I don't want a drink.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.096
Second woman today
that's turned me down.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.599
Got a revolving door, do you?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.100
That's not... not what--

13:29.183 --> 13:30.560
-I didn't mean it...
-Forget it.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.938
I have to get going.
I need to pack.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.148
-Pack?
-Yeah.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.942
Taking some time off...

13:39.193 --> 13:40.903
get out of the city for a while.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.447
How much time?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.449
Why?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.619
You gonna miss me?

13:47.702 --> 13:48.703
[scoffs]

13:50.872 --> 13:52.289
And if I said I would?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.798
[sighs deeply]

14:04.969 --> 14:08.180
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again...

14:09.641 --> 14:10.725
not alive.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.978
Not after that last call
the night half the city blew up.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.271
I left you a message when...

14:16.105 --> 14:17.482
when it was over.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.734
Yeah, you left a message.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.861
Come on, what'd you expect, Claire?

14:23.029 --> 14:27.033
You made it pretty clear
you didn't want to move forward with...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.117
whatever this was.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.994
You know what it was...

14:31.328 --> 14:33.080
-what it could've been.
-If I stopped.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.957
I'm not looking
to go around in circles, Matt.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.251
I know you're not going to stop.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.632
Not until this city is safe
from people like Fisk.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.133
Which is never.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.138
It'll always be something, someone...

14:49.931 --> 14:51.641
you know that, right?

14:52.434 --> 14:53.435
[mouthing]

14:55.437 --> 14:58.898
You told me you were the man
this city needs.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.526
I think that was only half true.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.031
I think you're also the man
this city created...

15:09.325 --> 15:11.202
for better or worse.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.790
I'm sorry you got pulled back into this.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.417
[Claire sighs]

15:18.501 --> 15:21.921
At least I got to see you
with your shirt off again.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.631
-So, hey...
-[Matt laughs softly]

15:23.715 --> 15:24.882
...it's not all bad.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.384
Thank you, Claire.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.178
I know I keep saying it,

15:29.261 --> 15:32.014
and it probably doesn't mean
anything at this point, but...

15:33.057 --> 15:34.141
thank you.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.479
I'll always be there...

15:39.021 --> 15:41.107
when you really need me...

15:41.190 --> 15:42.775
to patch you up.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.987
Beyond that...

15:47.279 --> 15:48.322
Yeah.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.575
Yeah.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.419
You know, the only thing
I remember from Sunday school...

16:03.880 --> 16:05.590
is the martyrs...

16:06.758 --> 16:09.010
the saints, the saviors...

16:09.761 --> 16:12.346
they all end up the same way.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.975
Bloody...

16:16.058 --> 16:17.644
and alone.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.437
I never said I was any of those.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.191
You didn't have to.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.624
[Karen] Hey.
[Ben] Hey.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.419
You still mad?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.130
What do you think?

16:48.257 --> 16:49.801
I'm sorry, Ben,
I needed you--

16:49.884 --> 16:51.969
You know who needs me, Karen?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.221
My wife...

16:55.598 --> 16:56.599
she needs me.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.477
-It was important.
-You could've just told me...

17:00.562 --> 17:02.104
but no,

17:02.188 --> 17:05.942
instead you gotta spin some story
about this great place upstate...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.985
could be good for Doris.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.654
Like you give a damn.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.699
Hey, that's not fair.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.619
Welcome to my life.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.663
Wait, you're right.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.247
You're right.
I should've told you.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.124
Then why didn't you?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.543
I...

17:24.544 --> 17:25.878
was afraid you'd say no.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.756
Probably would've.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.675
This isn't a story.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.010
This is people's lives.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.097
And what Fisk has been doing,
the person that he really is...

17:36.180 --> 17:40.351
We finally have the smoking gun or...
or whatever.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.144
More a whatever than a gun.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.772
You need to print this.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.816
Get it out there
for everyone to see.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.525
Not that simple.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.195
Fisk killed his father,
people need to know that.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.240
She's an old lady...

17:54.323 --> 17:55.366
confused...

17:56.075 --> 17:59.370
talking about things that...
maybe happened a long time ago.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.122
So you don't believe her?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.414
Okay...

18:04.208 --> 18:05.251
let's play this out.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.715
So I write up the story...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.092
get it on the front page.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.886
Then what happens?

18:14.969 --> 18:17.847
Well, everybody will see that he's
been lying about his past.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.976
Yeah, sure, absolutely will.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.519
Then he goes on TV again,

18:23.603 --> 18:26.105
tells everybody, yes,
he lied about his past

18:26.188 --> 18:30.652
because he was just a scared little kid
trying to protect his mother.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.445
Maybe he even rolls the old girl out,

18:33.529 --> 18:35.281
gets all teary-eyed.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.448
See where I'm going with this?

18:36.532 --> 18:38.367
Sounds like you're going nowhere.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.369
Need to think this through,
all I'm saying.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.372
He's gonna win.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.291
If we don't do something,
Fisk is gonna win.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.294
There are no winners and losers
in something like this.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.130
Well, Elena Cardenas
might disagree with you...

18:51.213 --> 18:53.090
if she still could.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.472
Maybe we don't have to do anything.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.559
What does that mean?

19:03.643 --> 19:07.063
Hear about the benefit the other night
at the old Van Lunt building?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.481
Fisk raising money
for his better tomorrow?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.359
Yeah, a bunch of one-percenters
jerking each other off.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.571
Though, I read
they all got food poisoning.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.990
Don't think it was bad hors d'oeuvres.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.535
Got an unconfirmed source, says...

19:21.618 --> 19:23.495
it was something in the drinks.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.122
Maybe even a couple fatalities.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.374
Holy shit.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.837
Why isn't this all over the news?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.089
Fisk spinning it, I guess.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.382
Which means he's got a lot
of pull in the media.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.093
Maybe even at the Bulletin,
I don't know.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.804
Wait, uh, back up.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.098
If this is true,
why would someone attack a benefit?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.726
Fisk made himself public.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.268
People who he's connected with

19:46.352 --> 19:48.938
might be less inclined
to be dragged out of the shadows.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.565
You think someone's trying to kill Fisk?

19:51.648 --> 19:55.737
I've been writing about crime in this city
since before you were born.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.864
The only thing I know without a doubt...

19:58.823 --> 20:01.575
is you don't get
to be the man at the top

20:01.658 --> 20:05.621
without making enemies looking
to tear you down to the ground.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.550
[Wesley sighs]

20:18.634 --> 20:19.676
No.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.895
There was a time when I...

20:30.396 --> 20:32.231
I believed that I was complete...

20:34.066 --> 20:39.113
that I needed no one to truly...
understand who I am.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.247
If she dies--

20:48.330 --> 20:52.752
Rosenberg's in from Hartford,
and she's strong.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.004
-We've all seen that.
-Yes.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.801
Leland thinks...

21:00.802 --> 21:02.887
it might have been Nobu's men.

21:04.847 --> 21:05.932
Fate.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.269
-Sir?
-It was something Gao said to me.

21:10.352 --> 21:15.983
I had to choose a path
or fate would choose for me.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.653
I sent Leland to speak with her.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.781
You suspect her hand in this?

21:24.658 --> 21:27.453
Until we know for certain,
I suspect everyone.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.332
You need to find who did this.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.168
You need to.

21:35.086 --> 21:39.548
I want to look in their eyes
when I salt the earth with their blood.

21:42.676 --> 21:43.886
Understood.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.599
I told her the safest place
she could ever be was by my side.

21:48.682 --> 21:49.683
This wasn't your fault.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.353
Well, she's lying in there
because she was by my side.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.649
[Wesley sighs deeply]

21:57.733 --> 21:59.318
We'll make the arrangements.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.572
If she recovers,
I want her sent away.

22:04.115 --> 22:07.368
Somewhere far from me...
and the city.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.121
I... doubt she would want that.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.748
Well, we seldom get everything we want...

22:12.832 --> 22:14.458
not in this world.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.169
But...

22:17.253 --> 22:19.171
some of us deserve to.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.178
Just move the appropriate funds
into place.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.598
I'll have Leland attend to it.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.726
No, no, I want it done quietly.
Handle it yourself.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.106
I'll have the papers
messengered to your penthouse.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.691
-Thank you, Wesley.
-Mmm.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.199
I...

22:54.540 --> 22:56.500
Thank you.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.637
[Doctor Rosenberg]
I know you've waited a while.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.847
[Fisk] Just... please tell me
what's going on.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.224
Is she gonna make it?

23:12.308 --> 23:15.311
She's in an induced coma now.
She's gonna pull through.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.437
She'll pull through.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.814
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you so much.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.524
[Doctor Rosenberg]
Don't thank me.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.343
Morning service was hours ago.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.885
I know.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.012
[church bell tolling]

23:50.096 --> 23:51.430
Confession?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.184
Latte?

23:56.227 --> 23:57.561
Not today, Father.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.232
Probably for the best,
already had four cups.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.192
Decaf.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.027
But you know there's still
a bit of caffeine in there

24:05.111 --> 24:06.362
they just can't get out.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.991
Some things are just...
too ingrained, I guess.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.868
That thing...

24:14.870 --> 24:16.330
brought you here last time...

24:17.664 --> 24:19.750
didn't go so well?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.210
Not so much.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.588
The man...

24:24.671 --> 24:25.714
you talked of...

24:26.632 --> 24:27.841
did you...

24:27.924 --> 24:29.343
No, I didn't kill him.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.053
[sighs deeply]

24:32.513 --> 24:33.930
But I tried to.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.685
And are you disappointed
that you didn't succeed...

24:39.770 --> 24:41.313
or maybe a little relieved?

24:44.525 --> 24:48.320
A friend of mine says that if I don't
change the way I do things...

24:48.404 --> 24:49.988
the way I live my life...

24:51.865 --> 24:54.535
I will end up bloody and alone.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.786
You believe that?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.581
I'm not afraid of dying.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.461
Lot of people aren't,
comes right down to it.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.005
It's living scares
the holy crap out of 'em.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.010
You know what I do?

25:13.679 --> 25:15.013
Who I am?

25:22.646 --> 25:24.731
Sacrament of Penance,
like I told you.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.151
-Don't have to worry about--
-It's not what I'm asking.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.779
Yes, Matthew, I'm not an idiot.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.490
I have a pretty good idea
who you are...

25:34.866 --> 25:36.285
and what you do.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.162
How you do it...

25:38.245 --> 25:39.288
[exclaims]

25:39.371 --> 25:41.457
...that's something else entirely.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.583
Accident...

25:42.666 --> 25:44.626
when I was a kid.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.503
Used to think it was God's will.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.921
Used to?

25:49.340 --> 25:53.760
Yeah, he made each and every one of us
with a purpose, didn't he?

25:53.844 --> 25:55.554
A reason for being.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.181
I believe so, yes.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.558
Then why did he put the Devil in me?

26:01.310 --> 26:03.312
Why do I feel it in my heart...

26:04.271 --> 26:05.731
and my soul...

26:07.858 --> 26:10.902
clawing to be let out...

26:10.986 --> 26:14.448
if that's not all part of God's plan?

26:14.531 --> 26:15.949
[groans]

26:18.160 --> 26:22.914
Maybe you're being called to summon
the better angels of your nature.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.709
Maybe that's the struggle
you're feeling...

26:25.792 --> 26:26.835
deep within you.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.838
And how do you know the angels
and the Devil inside me

26:29.921 --> 26:31.215
aren't the same thing?

26:31.298 --> 26:32.591
I don't,

26:32.674 --> 26:34.593
but nothing drives people
to the church faster

26:34.676 --> 26:37.846
than the thought of the Devil
snapping at their heels.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.226
Maybe that was God's plan all along.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.896
Why he created him,
allowed him to fall from grace...

26:45.979 --> 26:48.064
to become a symbol to be feared...

26:48.774 --> 26:50.526
warning to us all,

26:51.985 --> 26:54.905
to tread the path of the righteous.

26:58.534 --> 27:03.079
[thunder rumbling softly]

27:13.215 --> 27:14.258
[yells]

27:15.759 --> 27:16.760
[screams]

27:34.861 --> 27:36.988
[Fisk yelling]

27:38.740 --> 27:40.326
[gasping]

27:44.496 --> 27:46.081
[thunder rumbles]

27:53.046 --> 27:54.340
[groans]

28:07.519 --> 28:09.730
-[gun firing]
-[glass shattering]

28:37.591 --> 28:38.759
[grunts]

28:39.885 --> 28:41.094
[groans]

28:42.513 --> 28:44.097
[breathing heavily]

28:44.180 --> 28:45.682
I'm really not in the mood
for this tonight.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.060
It's cool, man, it's cool.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.147
We don't gotta do all that.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.610
Go for the knife in your boot,
I break your leg.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.613
Go for the backup piece tucked behind
your belt, I throw you off the roof.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.198
-We good?
-Yeah.

29:02.283 --> 29:05.369
Yeah, man, we good.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.666
[grunting]

29:13.126 --> 29:14.628
I didn't say, "Get up."

29:14.711 --> 29:17.714
What're you beating on me for?
I ain't done nothin'.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.175
It's not about you.
I want information.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.219
What I look like,
public damn library?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.890
Ow! Jesus, all right!

29:26.973 --> 29:29.435
What do you want to know, man? Shit.

29:29.518 --> 29:30.519
Fisk.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.647
-I don't know where he is, I swear.
-That's not the question.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.276
Fisk wears some kind of body armor...
light, strong.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.278
Where's he get it?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.612
The hell should I know?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.864
-Then you're no use to me.
-Whoa.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.032
Whoa, whoa!

29:44.115 --> 29:46.410
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

29:47.243 --> 29:50.080
Body armor, body armor.
Yeah, yeah.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.874
Yeah, body armor.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.918
I think I might...
I think I might know a guy.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.921
Give me the name.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.382
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[monitor beeping]

30:30.454 --> 30:33.248
Yeah, no, we're on the same page.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.626
Let me call you--
I'll call you back.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.006
How is she?

30:41.089 --> 30:43.425
Well, she hasn't woken up.

30:44.801 --> 30:49.097
Rosenberg says
that there may be complications.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.433
If that happens,
we'll deal with it.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.687
My mother called.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.399
Can you return,
see what she needs?

30:58.482 --> 31:00.609
-I'll take care of it.
-[Leland] Get out of my way.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.487
Um...

31:04.613 --> 31:06.865
how is she?
She, uh...

31:06.948 --> 31:08.241
still with us?

31:08.825 --> 31:09.993
-Yes.
-[Leland sighs]

31:10.076 --> 31:12.496
Well... that's something.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.289
I don't want to be disturbed.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.374
Understood.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.126
I could use a minute,
before you--

31:20.879 --> 31:22.047
What am I, invisible?

31:22.130 --> 31:23.298
Did you speak with Gao?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.385
We had a chat, yeah.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.220
And?

31:29.304 --> 31:30.514
And what?

31:30.597 --> 31:32.307
She said she was deeply saddened

31:32.391 --> 31:36.562
and quoted a fortune cookie
or some mystical shit.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.772
[sighs] Did she sound sincere?

31:38.855 --> 31:41.858
The hell do I know?
She was speaking in Chinese.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.194
I don't think the guy translating for her
liked me very much.

31:44.277 --> 31:47.656
He kept staring at me funny.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.491
Funny how?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.784
Funny!

31:50.867 --> 31:53.078
[scoffs] Who the hell cares?

31:53.161 --> 31:57.082
She said she'd stand with us...
if it comes to that.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.209
-You believe her?
-[sighs]

31:59.292 --> 32:01.462
I don't know, maybe.

32:01.545 --> 32:02.671
We need to be sure.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.299
The only thing I know for sure
is that he needs to get back to business

32:06.382 --> 32:08.259
while there's still
business to get back to.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.678
-He will.
-When?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.304
When he deems it appropriate.

32:11.387 --> 32:15.183
Well, doesn't that just
fill me with confidence?

32:15.266 --> 32:19.145
Do you think whoever did this...
just roll up the sidewalk and move on?

32:19.229 --> 32:21.857
If they came after him once,
they'll come after him again,

32:21.940 --> 32:23.775
sooner or later.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.947
Go home, get some rest.
We'll call if you're needed.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.366
Sure, I'll wait by the phone.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.786
It's not like I have
anything better to do.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.664
[sighs]

32:44.045 --> 32:45.380
[clears throat]

32:49.050 --> 32:52.638
Hello, Marlene?
It's Wesley.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.726
No, I work with your son.
We've met before.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.104
James Wesley, that's right.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.859
Uh, no, he's indisposed
at the moment, I'm sorry.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.069
Was there something
I could help you with?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.661
Wait, I'm sorry.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.497
Who came to visit you?

34:12.008 --> 34:13.301
[shutter door opening]

35:06.021 --> 35:07.773
You shouldn't be here.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.738
You work for Fisk?

35:17.991 --> 35:19.450
I asked you a question.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.954
[grunting]

35:32.923 --> 35:34.465
You shouldn't be here.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.971
No, no, it's nothing.
I'll see to it, Marlene.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.017
Yes, I'll have him call you
as soon as he's free.

35:44.935 --> 35:48.104
[laughs] You, too.
Good night.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.449
I need your piece.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.286
Discreetly, please.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.495
[sighs]

36:07.708 --> 36:09.125
Keys.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.798
You want I should drive you?

36:14.881 --> 36:17.508
No, I want as many men on him
as possible at all times.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.971
No one goes in or out of that room
without you checking 'em first, clear?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.806
Yeah, what if he asks for you?

36:22.889 --> 36:24.265
Tell him I won't be long.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.562
[yelling]

36:43.785 --> 36:45.120
[panting]

36:45.203 --> 36:46.747
That wasn't very nice.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.793
[straining]

37:38.131 --> 37:40.675
[both gasping]

37:47.140 --> 37:50.226
[sobbing]
You're not supposed to be in here.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.313
Mr. Fisk's gonna be mad.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.732
He's gonna hurt her.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.276
Who--
Who's he gonna hurt?

37:58.359 --> 38:02.280
-[Melvin sniffling]
-Melvin, that's your name, isn't it?

38:02.363 --> 38:03.614
Melvin Potter?

38:03.698 --> 38:06.076
[sniffling]

38:06.159 --> 38:08.078
[stammering]
How do you know that?

38:08.744 --> 38:11.331
Who's Fisk going to hurt, Melvin?

38:11.414 --> 38:13.792
[sobbing] Betsy.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.173
Who's-- Who's Betsy?

38:22.217 --> 38:25.553
She's nice, she helps me...

38:27.430 --> 38:30.475
[sniffling] when I...
when I get confused.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.519
Why would...
why would Fisk want to hurt her?

38:33.603 --> 38:37.023
No one's supposed to be here, in...
in the shop,

38:37.107 --> 38:39.150
unless he brings them.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.569
So you do work for Fisk.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.991
I said no, when he asked.

38:46.074 --> 38:51.037
[stuttering]
Said no, Betsy wouldn't like it.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.289
She wants me to be good.
I gotta be good.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.460
So I... I make things.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.296
I'm good at making things.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.423
[softly] I'm sorry, Melvin.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.760
Fisk has hurt people
that I care about, too.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.971
I know what it's like
to worry about them...

39:09.555 --> 39:11.141
wanting to keep them safe.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.226
He make you work for him, too?

39:13.309 --> 39:15.896
No, I don't work for Fisk.

39:17.147 --> 39:20.608
I want to stop him
from hurting anyone else...

39:20.691 --> 39:22.152
from hurting Betsy.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.114
-You could do that?
-Maybe.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.824
Did you make a suit for Fisk?

39:29.951 --> 39:32.662
Did you make a suit
lined with this?

39:32.745 --> 39:36.291
Made a whole bunch.
It keeps him safe.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.584
Can you make something
for me out of this?

39:39.502 --> 39:42.797
[stuttering] You want a suit, like...
like Mr. Fisk?

39:42.881 --> 39:46.342
No. No, I want
something very special.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.428
And if you do this for me...

39:49.554 --> 39:51.264
I promise to get
Fisk out of your life...

39:52.765 --> 39:54.350
and to keep Betsy safe.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.604
You can do that?

39:58.688 --> 40:00.315
With your help, I...

40:00.398 --> 40:01.649
I think maybe I can.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.277
What do you want me to make?

40:05.278 --> 40:06.821
A symbol.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.574
[soft rock music playing]

40:30.303 --> 40:31.554
[Foggy sighs]

40:42.815 --> 40:44.192
You're a dick.

40:45.235 --> 40:47.153
The hell did I do?

40:50.991 --> 40:52.742
I've been calling you all day.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.286
Been busy.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.623
-Did you even listen to my messages?
-Yeah.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.626
-And?
-And what?

41:01.709 --> 41:03.086
[laughs]

41:03.169 --> 41:05.505
You got a crazy old lady with a story

41:05.588 --> 41:07.923
about a young Willie Fisk
beaning his dad with a hammer.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.842
[stammering] He beat his father to death.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.095
He was 12,
40 some years ago.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.305
Jesus, why don't any of you...

41:16.474 --> 41:18.393
His mother is supposed
to be dead.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.187
[stammering] Foggy,
this proves that Fisk's been lying.

41:21.271 --> 41:22.855
You know who we're dealing with.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.275
It won't be enough.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.611
You sound just like Matt.

41:31.364 --> 41:32.907
You talked to him?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.911
He asked the same about you.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.622
-He did?
-When I was over at his place.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.083
What the hell happened?

41:42.167 --> 41:45.211
And don't... don't tell me
that it was a car accident.

41:45.295 --> 41:46.879
Ask him.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.299
-I did.
-What'd he say?

41:49.882 --> 41:51.842
Just that... it was his fault.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.636
[scoffs]

41:53.719 --> 41:55.138
Got that right.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.849
What is going on with you two?

41:58.933 --> 42:00.726
Why weren't you at the office?

42:00.810 --> 42:02.978
-It's not like we have any clients.
-Foggy...

42:13.073 --> 42:15.116
We're going through a rough patch.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.202
Found the Nelson and Murdock sign
in the trash.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.494
[laughs]

42:18.578 --> 42:20.746
A very rough patch.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.999
You wanna talk?

42:25.168 --> 42:26.669
Yeah...

42:29.630 --> 42:31.006
but I can't.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.929
Why?

42:40.683 --> 42:41.976
It's...

42:43.353 --> 42:46.021
If you say "it's complicated,"
I will punch you in the face.

42:46.106 --> 42:47.648
-[slams fist]
-It's personal!

42:48.566 --> 42:50.443
It's personal, okay?

42:57.158 --> 42:58.951
Okay...

42:59.034 --> 43:00.536
okay, it's personal, I get it.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.290
Really don't.
Trust me.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.506
They started tearing down
Elena's tenement building today.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.384
Did you know that?

43:14.467 --> 43:17.052
No, I didn't.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.056
Fisk is still out there, Foggy.

43:23.768 --> 43:26.396
Be nice if you and Matt
could get your heads out of your asses

43:26.479 --> 43:28.106
and help do something about it...

43:29.815 --> 43:32.860
before there's nothing left
of Hell's Kitchen to fight for.

43:39.867 --> 43:44.872
Uh, Matt, it's Karen.
I just saw Foggy at Josie's. He's, um...

43:46.040 --> 43:48.626
Can you two please
get your shit together?

43:48.709 --> 43:52.797
I thought we were supposed to be a team,
not whatever this is, okay?

43:52.880 --> 43:55.508
Call me back... seriously.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.468
[trembling]

43:57.552 --> 43:58.803
Bye.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.097
[cell phone ringing]

44:08.813 --> 44:11.065
-Yeah.
-Hi...

44:11.149 --> 44:13.651
-it's Karen.
-I know.

44:13.734 --> 44:17.572
They got this thing, caller ID,
might have heard of it.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.533
You still sound pissed.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.494
Just tired.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.623
You okay?

44:27.707 --> 44:30.335
Will be.
What's up?

44:32.337 --> 44:34.797
Matt and Foggy are...

44:34.880 --> 44:37.049
I don't know what.
They had some kind of fight and now...

44:37.800 --> 44:40.220
I feel like it's falling apart, Ben.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.805
All of it.

44:43.639 --> 44:46.809
Ah, it's usually right around the time
you know the story's getting interesting.

44:50.730 --> 44:52.565
How do you do this...

44:53.608 --> 44:54.859
day after day?

44:55.735 --> 44:59.697
One foot in front of the other,
just like everybody else.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.742
Yeah, but you're not
like everybody else.

45:03.993 --> 45:05.411
You know that, right?

45:06.871 --> 45:08.581
We all do what we can.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.417
Sometimes it's enough.

45:12.918 --> 45:14.337
Thank you, Ben.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.006
[sighs]

45:17.089 --> 45:18.549
I didn't say I was writing that story.

45:18.633 --> 45:20.635
[sniffling] I know. I know.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.971
Just thank you for...

45:24.054 --> 45:25.890
for being there, for...

45:26.724 --> 45:28.100
for caring.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.562
You, too.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.065
Talk tomorrow?

45:35.983 --> 45:39.362
Yeah, talk tomorrow.

45:41.489 --> 45:42.907
Okay.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.736
Shit, seriously?

46:24.699 --> 46:26.409
[muffled scream]

46:34.041 --> 46:36.043
I don't know how to pray.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.007
My father was not a religious man.

46:42.091 --> 46:45.595
My mother wanted to be...
I think, needed to be,

46:45.678 --> 46:48.681
but she never quite
found it within herself.

46:52.101 --> 46:54.520
I'd seen it in movies,

46:54.604 --> 46:57.106
and watched it on television.

46:57.189 --> 47:01.068
I read it in books when I was a child,
after I was sent away.

47:02.111 --> 47:04.780
And I tried to mimic words...

47:06.866 --> 47:08.701
the sentiment...

47:15.375 --> 47:17.502
but it was false.

47:19.462 --> 47:21.589
It was imitation of faith.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.385
So...

47:27.720 --> 47:29.639
I can't pray for you.

47:34.226 --> 47:36.353
All I can do...

47:36.437 --> 47:38.898
is make you a promise.

47:38.981 --> 47:41.526
One that not even God,
if there is such a thing,

47:41.609 --> 47:43.861
can prevent me from keeping.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.826
The people that did this to you...

47:51.952 --> 47:53.120
they will suffer.

47:58.501 --> 47:59.794
They will suffer.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.549
[water dripping]

48:06.091 --> 48:07.552
[gasping]

48:33.536 --> 48:35.287
[Wesley sighing]

48:35.370 --> 48:36.664
I thought...

48:37.582 --> 48:39.333
maybe you weren't coming out of it.

48:40.543 --> 48:42.712
That would have been a shame.

48:42.795 --> 48:43.879
[grunting]

48:43.963 --> 48:45.005
[Wesley] Tut-tut.

48:45.965 --> 48:48.718
You might wanna take a moment.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.514
In the meantime, I...

48:53.598 --> 48:55.182
I thought we could chat.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.901
[sighs]

49:06.944 --> 49:08.654
You can't do this.

49:11.657 --> 49:14.827
And yet, here we are.

49:17.538 --> 49:18.873
[gasping]

49:18.956 --> 49:22.960
You know, funny story,
after the Union Allied article, I...

49:23.043 --> 49:26.130
inquired as to whether
you needed further attention.

49:26.213 --> 49:28.549
The feeling was you'd already
done whatever damage you could,

49:28.633 --> 49:30.384
so it wasn't necessary.

49:30.467 --> 49:32.970
You were a... nobody...

49:33.053 --> 49:35.973
a very small cog
in the machine.

49:36.056 --> 49:39.351
So, an offer was made
through a third party.

49:40.269 --> 49:42.312
A legal agreement,
one you signed...

49:43.272 --> 49:45.650
in exchange for a reasonable
amount of money.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.192
Well...

49:47.276 --> 49:48.861
reasonable to you.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.742
You were supposed
to go away, Miss Page.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.787
Fade back into...

49:57.870 --> 49:59.955
wherever people like you fade.

50:00.039 --> 50:02.374
But you made a choice...

50:03.083 --> 50:06.295
and that choice has brought you here...

50:06.378 --> 50:09.048
on this night,
at this particular moment in time.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.216
[breathing raggedly]

50:11.300 --> 50:13.302
Perhaps that's the way
it was always gonna be.

50:13.385 --> 50:15.304
Perhaps we're destined...

50:16.221 --> 50:19.099
to follow a path
none of us can see, only...

50:20.017 --> 50:21.143
vaguely sense,

50:21.226 --> 50:24.814
as it takes our hand,
guiding us towards the inevitable.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.066
Is that supposed to scare me?

50:27.149 --> 50:29.151
No, no...

50:30.194 --> 50:31.195
uh, this is.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.490
[Karen gasps]

50:48.253 --> 50:49.546
Do I have your attention?

50:53.926 --> 50:57.680
Hello, could you, like,
nod or something?

51:00.140 --> 51:01.391
[inhales sharply]

51:02.602 --> 51:04.436
Do you love this city?

51:06.271 --> 51:07.272
What?

51:07.356 --> 51:09.775
It's a simple question.
Do you love this city?

51:10.442 --> 51:11.443
I...

51:12.612 --> 51:13.821
I, um...

51:15.823 --> 51:17.241
haven't been here long enough.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.367
Huh.

51:18.450 --> 51:21.036
I find a few days,
a week at most,

51:21.120 --> 51:23.914
is ample time to form
an emotional response.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.043
Growing to love something is really...

51:28.127 --> 51:31.255
simply forgetting slowly
what you dislike about it.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.886
I'll be perfectly honest,
the situation calls for it, I do not...

51:38.012 --> 51:39.805
love this city.

51:40.514 --> 51:43.934
The crush of the unwashed garbage
stacked on the sidewalk,

51:44.018 --> 51:46.729
the air that seems
to adhere to your skin,

51:46.812 --> 51:50.482
the layer of filth you can never
completely wash away.

51:51.651 --> 51:53.610
-Maybe you should move.
-[Wesley laughs]

51:54.904 --> 51:57.782
I'm not here because I want to be.
I'm here because I'm needed.

51:59.241 --> 52:00.284
By Fisk?

52:01.911 --> 52:04.621
He loves this city.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.832
In a way you and I never could.

52:06.916 --> 52:08.333
I don't expect you to understand that.

52:08.417 --> 52:10.795
There are moments
when even I struggle to,

52:10.878 --> 52:12.421
but he does...

52:13.463 --> 52:14.840
very deeply.

52:14.924 --> 52:18.260
Almost, I suspect, as much
as he loves his mother.

52:24.599 --> 52:28.312
Frankly, I was surprised
she remembered you.

52:30.272 --> 52:34.193
Recent memories for her
are fleeting gossamer...

52:34.276 --> 52:37.988
often plucked from grasp
by the slightest breeze.

52:38.072 --> 52:41.241
But you, you left an impression.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.995
The nice blonde lady
with the big blue eyes.

52:45.079 --> 52:48.916
And the man you were with,
Mr. Urich, I'm guessing.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.210
[Wesley sighs heavily]

52:51.293 --> 52:52.837
My employer--

52:53.462 --> 52:56.465
Sorry, old habits.
Mr. Fisk...

52:57.382 --> 52:59.051
as I said,
loves his mother.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.470
He would be extremely...

53:03.806 --> 53:04.849
disturbed...

53:06.183 --> 53:07.184
if he knew you'd found her.

53:07.267 --> 53:08.936
Even more so
that you've been to see her.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.689
You haven't told him?

53:12.773 --> 53:14.942
He's preoccupied
with more important matters,

53:15.025 --> 53:17.569
so I've taken it upon myself
to address the situation.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.532
If you're going to kill me...

53:23.909 --> 53:25.244
just do it.

53:26.328 --> 53:28.247
I'm sick of listening
to your bullshit.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.832
[laughing]

53:32.126 --> 53:36.713
I'm not here to kill you, Miss Page.
I'm here to offer you a job.

53:39.091 --> 53:40.926
[laughing weakly]

53:46.431 --> 53:48.683
Can I get a coffee, please? Black.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.937
Can I get you anything to eat, sir?

53:52.021 --> 53:55.357
No, thank you, Francis.
Where's Wesley?

53:57.651 --> 54:00.362
So, after all of this,
I'm supposed to, what...

54:00.445 --> 54:01.446
[scoffs]

54:02.656 --> 54:04.366
...be your secretary?

54:04.449 --> 54:07.327
The position I have in mind
is a little more...

54:07.411 --> 54:08.871
involved.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.539
You've proven yourself resourceful,

54:10.622 --> 54:13.417
tenacious, with a commendable
ability to convince others

54:13.500 --> 54:15.085
that your way is the right one,

54:15.169 --> 54:17.212
the way that needs to be followed,

54:17.296 --> 54:21.425
pursued despite the obvious repercussions
such actions may incur.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.218
[laughs] Is that even English?

54:23.302 --> 54:24.303
Ha...

54:25.095 --> 54:27.097
simply stated...

54:29.308 --> 54:32.477
you're going to convince Mr. Urich...

54:33.395 --> 54:34.479
that everything is fine...

54:35.522 --> 54:40.069
that you were wrong...
that Wilson Fisk is a good man...

54:41.236 --> 54:43.447
a man this city needs.

54:43.530 --> 54:46.408
And then you're going
to spread the gospel

54:46.491 --> 54:49.578
to everyone you've infected
with your negative point of view.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.706
[softly] I'd rather die first.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.211
But you won't...

54:57.294 --> 55:00.172
be the first to die, Miss Page, no.

55:00.255 --> 55:03.550
No, I think Mr. Urich
will have that honor.

55:03.633 --> 55:07.847
Then we'll go to your place of employment,
see to Mr. Nelson, Mr. Murdock.

55:07.930 --> 55:11.683
After that, your friends, family,
everyone you've ever cared about.

55:11.766 --> 55:14.854
And when you have
no tears left to shed, then...

55:17.064 --> 55:20.359
then we'll come for you, Miss Page.

Do you really think...

55:51.431 --> 55:54.894
I would put a loaded gun on the table
where you could reach it?

55:57.312 --> 55:58.730
-I don't know.
