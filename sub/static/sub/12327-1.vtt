WEBVTT

02:04.082 --> 02:06.166
Fast bike, huh?

02:07.043 --> 02:09.544
Yeah, sometimes.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.797
Want me to fill it up?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.591
I'm not here for the gas.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.344
You can keep an
eye on it for me.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.044
Leave it on the road, guys.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.548
That stunt almost
cost me my ride, boy.

02:54.966 --> 02:59.052
- You were in my way. I was in a hurry.
- Well, now you'll be late.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.056
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass
off my car.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.730
What is it about driving cars
that makes you all such assholes?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.636
Can you clean these
dirty windows?

03:40.803 --> 03:43.138
Five bucks.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.973
Make it 10.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.979
Thanks.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.149
Buckle up.

04:02.367 --> 04:06.286
Well. It didn't take long
for you to find trouble.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.040
Step up. I'm running
a two-for-one special today.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.167
Special, huh?

04:14.712 --> 04:18.339
Can I get fries with that?
Because I'm hungry as hell.

04:19.132 --> 04:22.344
- What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you, man.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.138
- Wish I could say the same for you.
- Welcome home.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.184
Thanks, man.
Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.480
Dude's gone six months in Thailand
without a word...

04:33.648 --> 04:35.357
...and now he's
busting our chops.

04:35.525 --> 04:39.695
- Since when did you get so sensitive?
- I got a rally to get to.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.697
You must be in a hurry to die.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.701
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be
as happy to see you as we are.

04:45.868 --> 04:49.538
- You were on the run. Why you back now?
- I gotta make things right.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.209
I couldn't stop
thinking about her.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.547
- And here I thought it was all about us.
- Look...

04:58.715 --> 05:02.759
...this is my mess, not yours.
You don't have to make this run.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.388
- We can't let you have all the fun.
- You're gonna need us.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.268
Yes, I am.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.228
Still know how to
ride that thing?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.897
We'll have to race
the twisties to find out.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.819
Ford, what the hell
are you doing?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.823
I don't want to miss that look
on your face when I blow past you.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.996
What the...?

07:47.049 --> 07:50.594
- We got company.
- Out of my way, punk!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.392
What's his problem?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.271
I got him!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
- Your ass is mine.
- Let's go, punk.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.072
Come on, what you got?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.034
- You like that?
- Bring that piece of shit on.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.433
I'm burning, I'm burning.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.649
- Relax!
- You should've let him burn!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.192
He could've killed us!

08:47.360 --> 08:51.655
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet.
Move out of the way.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.658
Let's see if this guy fights
as bad as he rides.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.494
- Walk away.
- You got loud pipes...

08:57.662 --> 08:59.746
...but you ain't saying nothing!

08:59.914 --> 09:01.790
You ain't gonna
like how this ends.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.104
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.493
What's up, J? Drop something?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.954
Just taking care of
some business, T.

09:44.083 --> 09:48.878
Ford. I heard you was up in Indochina
eating sushi and shit.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.718
- I thought sushi came from Japan.
- I know where sushi come from, nigga.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.721
I ain't even talking to you.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.561
You know I could
smash you right now.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.813
You and your little tricycle friends.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.984
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.362
Consider it a
welcome-home present.

10:15.072 --> 10:19.993
Under one condition. Somebody gonna
give my brother a new bike.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.079
- I want his bike.
- I ain't giving you shit.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.881
There's only one way
you're getting one of these.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.596
I know you been gone
a long time, Ford.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.058
But not long enough to forget
who run things around here.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.062
I hate to see you end
up as Dojo's dinner.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.732
Trey. One-time.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.364
Probably not a good time
to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.909
Get that bike from you later.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.877
Hey, officer, how's it going?
Beautiful day today.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.424
- What are you waiting for?
- What you think?

11:57.591 --> 11:59.509
Go show these boys how to ride.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.679
- How about a ride?
- This might be too much for you.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.765
- We'll never know till I'm on it.
- All right, you too.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.935
It's not that I don't
enjoy your company.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.020
Just be gentle with him.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.319
- Nice bike.
- Nice ass.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.822
Got a name?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.824
Yeah.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.211
Ford. What's he doing here?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.684
Forecast for today,
sun, sun and more sun.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.354
Highs 94 to 103.
Don't forget your sunscreen, folks.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.984
Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour,
with locally higher gusts.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.705
Be with you in a second.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.875
Looking for something
in particular?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.421
You got one of them seats
in a pink Naugahyde?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.548
Maybe with a little gold fringe?

13:22.426 --> 13:24.385
You never were funny, Ford.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.514
Oh, come on, you used to think
I was funny.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.557
Maybe you lost your
sense of humor.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.685
I think I have a pretty good
sense of humor.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.231
Like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop...

13:36.398 --> 13:39.567
...waving warrants, telling me
my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

13:39.735 --> 13:42.946
That was funny.
I laughed my ass off for weeks.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.365
I wrote you letters.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.743
- I made fires.
- I tried to call.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.580
Yeah, but my phone was tapped
for six months. That was fun too.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.334
- Can I explain?
- Let me guess.

13:56.502 --> 14:00.255
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me,
you were trying to protect me...

14:00.422 --> 14:03.466
- ...and it wasn't your fault.
- It was my fault.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.426
- We're closed.
- The sign said...

14:05.594 --> 14:09.430
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.058
You too, Ford.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.106
You don't know how many times
I've...

14:18.274 --> 14:21.025
...played this out in my head
the last six months.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.945
Must be frustrating.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.242
You got balls even coming here.

14:29.410 --> 14:34.247
Feds and the Hellions are after you and
Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.748
Yeah.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.461
Well, that's because I did.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.090
- Ford?
- Yeah?

14:44.425 --> 14:46.009
Go now, please, before I...

14:46.427 --> 14:47.760
Before what?

15:11.201 --> 15:16.164
And to think we almost decided
to go to the beach this weekend.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.834
Lucky for me, Luther
hates to swim.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.798
Henry.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.094
I don't know why
you're buying a new seat, Ford.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.889
Looks like you haven't
broken in your old one yet.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.351
Looks like Ford prefers
to ride bitch to me.

15:36.518 --> 15:40.146
It looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself, Henry.

15:40.314 --> 15:46.361
Share one with your friends long enough
and you're liable to catch something.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.174
Heard you were in Indochina.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.885
Some shit like that.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.555
- Good food there?
- Thailand, actually...

16:14.723 --> 16:17.266
...but the food was great.
Thanks for asking.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.727
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.231
Tell me...

16:23.399 --> 16:25.566
...you got a punch
line for this,

16:25.734 --> 16:28.861
Where are my goddamn bikes?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.114
You really want them...

16:33.075 --> 16:34.617
...or what's inside them?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.540
Where are they?

16:42.292 --> 16:46.212
- Why don't you just cut it out of him.
- No, he won't.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.716
He's too smart for that.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.928
Because he knows if he touches me
he'll never get his shit back.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.972
Then again...

16:56.890 --> 16:58.433
...I'm not that smart.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.393
Shane.

17:07.984 --> 17:12.320
You've got till sundown
to hand over my bikes.

17:39.850 --> 17:45.313
- Your brother said we had a deal.
- Junior don't do deals around here, I do.

17:45.481 --> 17:51.569
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make
deals, he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

17:51.737 --> 17:56.783
That's funny, because I was
thinking the same thing.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.122
I didn't come here to watch you
pet your dog, primate.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.000
I didn't invite your
Dukes of Hazzard ass.

18:06.168 --> 18:10.379
So you can raise up whenever you feel it.
The answer is no.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.466
You're not slinging your dope
on my streets.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.846
Hand me that bottle.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.848
Look...

18:21.517 --> 18:24.852
...I'm not some
dimebag street punk.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.854
I'm a businessman.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.692
And I'm telling you
to make this right.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.988
I wouldn't give a shit
if you was Don Corleone himself.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.825
The answer is still no.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.701
So get out of my face.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.587
What the hell was
you looking at?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.549
I love you.

18:55.884 --> 18:59.428
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you
would've been down with that shit.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.389
You could've made a killing.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.601
First you gonna act a fool
up there on the road, now this? Huh?

19:05.769 --> 19:07.270
What's wrong with you?

19:07.437 --> 19:11.065
You messing with
my goddamn good nature, boy.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.861
Go get me a beer, man.
You messing up my buzz.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.906
Get me a Diet Pepsi.
Don't slam my door.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.576
You better count to 10!

19:22.494 --> 19:26.038
- I'm gonna whup his ass.
- Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.416
Dojo got more sense
than that boy.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.594
Henry, looks like
you're the one riding bitch.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.947
Looks like your engine
could use a little work.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.741
Ford.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.994
What part of "I don't love you
anymore, you're a bastard..."

20:05.162 --> 20:08.289
"...and I never wanna see you again"
didn't you understand?

20:08.790 --> 20:11.375
How about the part that stops you
from driving off right now?

20:38.528 --> 20:40.196
Thirsty?

21:01.343 --> 21:04.345
All right, one beer.
But you're buying.

21:14.481 --> 21:19.568
- What up, Junior? You all right?
- I'm definitely not all right. Move!

21:43.677 --> 21:45.219
Watch out, white boy.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.930
- Call it an accident?
- How about I kick your ass?

21:48.098 --> 21:50.516
No, I prefer we still
call it an accident.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.562
- How about now?
- Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.767
- Junior! Junior!
- I'm gonna kill you!

21:57.774 --> 21:59.859
Come on, chill!

22:23.175 --> 22:26.969
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always
got to show your ass, man, huh?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.597
Why you can't come here
and play your position?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.432
Look at me, boy.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.269
I love you. You're my brother,
but you better stop embarrassing me.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.813
Stop acting so damn crazy.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.983
And I got your back for life.

22:41.151 --> 22:45.863
Well, if you got my back, then show me,
blood, on everything!

22:46.031 --> 22:50.284
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't
got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.661
Watch out. Get out
of my way, man.

22:52.829 --> 22:57.083
Dawson's Creek almost beat
your brother's ass, blood.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.211
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.798
- What're we gonna do about Ford?
- Junior just solved our problem.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.385
- Why don't we just grab him right now?
- No, not now.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.971
I got a better idea.
Get the boys.

23:11.139 --> 23:15.810
What is it with you, Ford? Everywhere
you go, everything turns to hell.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.479
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.197
Go powder your nose, China.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.496
Let's have some fun.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.963
Whoot, whoot!

23:51.972 --> 23:54.598
- That's him. Get him.
- There he is.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.569
We'd like to thank the Hellions for
messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.988
He ain't going anywhere.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.532
- Here he comes.
- There he goes. Get him!

24:11.700 --> 24:13.826
See you, Junior.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.727
Hey, what's up, man?

24:40.854 --> 24:44.398
Hey. What's up?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.651
Hey, dude.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.367
- Damn!
- Shh.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.956
You screwed me, Junior.

25:01.583 --> 25:06.462
I assume you're apologizing
for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

25:09.090 --> 25:13.052
I made promises based
on your black ass.

25:20.435 --> 25:24.188
And now I've got a problem.

25:25.982 --> 25:29.276
- But you're gonna help me out of it.
- Yo, dog.

25:30.111 --> 25:33.906
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey.
We could work this out, man.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.575
I could make this
happen, all right?

25:37.786 --> 25:39.995
Time's up.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.969
You know what to do, baby?

25:57.847 --> 26:02.351
There's this one road that winds up
the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.896
It's got mountains on one side,
ocean on the other...

26:06.064 --> 26:09.984
...so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it.

26:12.821 --> 26:17.366
I tell you, the last six months, every time
I took that drive I thought about you.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.661
Did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to Thailand?

26:23.248 --> 26:26.125
You got to the bottom of this beer.
Explain away.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.753
All right.

26:29.921 --> 26:35.259
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't
like him, but he was a paying customer.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.345
I fixed his chopper
a couple times.

26:48.523 --> 26:53.444
Six months ago,
he turns up at your shop...

26:53.612 --> 26:57.197
...with these two bikes. He asked me
if I'd mind looking after them.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.949
I figure,
what the hell, right?

26:59.659 --> 27:01.201
So I do.

27:01.870 --> 27:06.624
Then I go to move them, they don't start.
So I check the tanks.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.668
They're filled with
kilos of crystal meth.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.296
So first thing, I get
them out of there.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.842
So that's why that fed McPherson
raided my shop after you split.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.013
And you dropped off
the face of the Earth.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.310
I took off...

27:27.729 --> 27:30.522
...so that you wouldn't
get dragged into it.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.234
I split.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.404
Now I'm the only one
involved with Henry.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.281
So you left to protect me?

27:40.825 --> 27:44.703
What'd you think, you were gonna just
come back and explain everything...

27:44.871 --> 27:48.916
...and then we'd just ride off
into the sunset together?

28:02.430 --> 28:04.598
More or less.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.477
Well, which is it? More or less?

28:10.522 --> 28:13.691
Well, I was actually
thinking Mexico.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.427
- You're killing me.
- Get your gear on.

28:41.594 --> 28:44.263
- Not a good time.
- Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.973
- Damn, really?
- Yeah.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.355
- Give me 10 minutes, all right?
- Come on.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.152
Move.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.988
Move, man! Move!

29:01.781 --> 29:03.699
Damn!

29:05.160 --> 29:07.161
Wait. That's my brother, man.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.871
It's all right.

29:10.206 --> 29:14.126
Oh, no. No, man.
I'm taking him with me.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.170
You can't do that, son.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.968
Now, we're gonna find
out who done this.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.555
If you have any ideas who would
want to kill your brother...

29:26.723 --> 29:30.058
If I knew who did this,
you'd have two dead bodies right now.

29:30.226 --> 29:33.520
We got a witness.
Says she saw the whole thing.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.899
A white male, mid-20s,
rode a custom motorcycle.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.694
- Wore black and orange leathers.
- Black and orange leathers?

29:40.862 --> 29:43.739
Hey, you know somebody
who fits that description?

29:45.408 --> 29:47.326
Not anymore.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.038
Let's go!

30:05.720 --> 30:09.389
FBI. Agent McPherson,
federal gang task force.

30:10.058 --> 30:13.393
Sheriff Barnes.
You don't look like your typical fed.

30:13.561 --> 30:18.232
What'd you expect? A cheap suit,
late-model Taurus, a $10 haircut?

30:19.275 --> 30:20.943
How'd y'all get here so fast?

30:21.110 --> 30:24.238
Get this many motorheads
in one place, all wearing colors...

30:24.405 --> 30:26.949
...something's bound to happen.
Pays to be close.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.409
Oh, this is Agent Henderson.

30:29.577 --> 30:32.955
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's one of the best field operatives.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.251
Excuse me, I have to take this.

30:38.169 --> 30:42.214
Yeah. Hi, baby.
I'm at a crime scene right now.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.633
- It's a typical homicide.
- Typical homicide?

30:44.801 --> 30:47.678
Oh, maybe you can explain to me
what a typical homicide is.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.098
All right, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I promise.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.067
- I've got an eyewitness.
- You do?

30:53.101 --> 30:55.352
- Yeah.
- You've practically got this solved.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.313
I love you too. Jesus Christ.

30:58.481 --> 31:01.441
We've got the murder weapon
and she saw the whole thing.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.069
Congratulations.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.782
I don't care if we have to comb
every inch of California.

31:08.950 --> 31:14.371
I want that boy Ford, and I want
his head in Dojo's bowl by midnight.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.958
- Amen?
- Amen.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.420
Come on, boy.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.820
Motel policy for cash customers.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.405
Jay.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.741
- Got him.
- Son of a bitch.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.493
- I tried to pop Ford six months ago.
- He's cute.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.830
You can visit him in prison.
Map.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.001
That's why you broke, you eat too much.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.257
- I got it.
- That's okay.

32:07.425 --> 32:11.595
What were you planning on paying with,
your good looks or your smile?

32:15.683 --> 32:18.518
I love a girl who can
take care of herself, man.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.855
I would've come back too.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.524
If you boys will excuse me.

32:26.402 --> 32:30.530
It seems like I'm overdue
for some paint and bodywork myself.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.993
So, what are you gonna do about Henry?
We got a plan, right?

32:35.620 --> 32:40.415
Yeah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna
tell Henry where he can pick up his shit.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.586
Of course...

32:45.672 --> 32:49.257
...I'm also gonna call that punk
McPherson and tell him.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.593
Arrange a get-together
with the evidence.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.346
That way everybody gets
what they deserve, right?

32:54.514 --> 32:57.224
Henry gets his shit,
McPherson gets Henry...

32:57.392 --> 32:59.893
...and we all go to
Mexico and get drunk.

33:02.146 --> 33:06.066
As I reported earlier, Wallace, a member
of an Inglewood motorcycle gang...

33:06.234 --> 33:10.237
...the Reapers, was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.907
With the help of an eyewitness,
the FBI has come up with a suspect,

33:14.075 --> 33:16.910
Cary Ford, a white male
in his late 20s.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.871
Ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle...

33:20.039 --> 33:22.290
...wearing orange and black
racing leathers.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.043
If you have any idea
as to his whereabouts...

33:25.378 --> 33:28.046
...please contact the
local authorities.

33:28.214 --> 33:32.300
Cary Ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of Junior Wallace.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.887
Call the sheriff, Hal.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.598
Ford was just spotted
at Lone Pine.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.851
Let's drive a little.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.363
Yeah.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.991
Heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.911
- Dawson's Creek, the white boy.
- All right, get me a map.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.166
We gotta make up some time.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.873
- Yeah?
- Give me Ford.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.918
Ford. It's for you.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.507
- Ford.
- Change in plans.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.550
Seems your buddy Junior's dead.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.052
Feds think you did it.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.972
Reapers think you did it.
Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.809
You tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.852
I don't take orders, Henry.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.105
- Never have, never will.
- What's that?

35:08.272 --> 35:11.024
Ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold?

35:11.192 --> 35:14.903
You spent too much time in Chink Land,
Ford. What does that mean?

35:15.071 --> 35:18.615
It means I don't wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.367
And by the way, Henry...

35:20.535 --> 35:24.371
"Chink Land" implies China. I was
in Thailand, it's a different country.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.373
Hey, my phone!

35:27.708 --> 35:29.876
Hold it right there.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.383
Everybody down on the ground!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.552
Quit shooting!

35:38.970 --> 35:40.303
You got the wrong guy.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.014
We'll let the sheriff sort it out
when they come.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.934
- Are you okay, Murphy?
- I got it under control!

35:46.310 --> 35:47.811
I didn't kill anybody.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.980
Shit!

35:53.317 --> 35:55.068
You Earl?

35:56.904 --> 35:59.239
Loved your French toast.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.827
- Down.
- Like I said, I love a girl...

36:03.995 --> 36:06.913
- ...who can take care of herself.
- Thanks.

36:07.081 --> 36:10.250
You're on the news.
That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

36:10.418 --> 36:14.296
- Henry set me up, wants his drugs back.
- Why don't you give them back.

36:14.463 --> 36:17.674
- It's the only insurance I got.
- You were with me last night.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.759
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

36:19.927 --> 36:21.636
Tell the cops.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.806
Right now it ain't the cops
that I'm worried about.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.308
Aw, not good.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.226
- Reapers!
- He's right, Shane.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.979
You think we could finish
this conversation later?

36:32.690 --> 36:36.860
All right. Once we're in the clear,
you call the cops. Agreed?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.279
What should I do with this?

36:39.447 --> 36:43.241
Forget what I said about liking women
who can take care of themselves.

36:44.785 --> 36:48.496
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy.
You'll be safer here than running with us.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.333
- See you back in L.A.
- What am I supposed to do?

36:51.500 --> 36:53.460
Hang out with Earl?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.021
Which way?

37:13.773 --> 37:15.398
Which way did you say, old man?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.988
- Which way?
- Shortcut!

37:25.952 --> 37:29.162
Let's catch them,
kill them and bury them!

37:33.334 --> 37:36.127
They're still on us!
Shit! There's more of them!

37:36.295 --> 37:38.838
- What are we gonna do, Ford?
- Where we going?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.258
I'm working on it!

38:05.741 --> 38:07.701
Which way did they go?

38:18.921 --> 38:20.588
Damn! Come on!

38:45.865 --> 38:47.198
Now can we call the cops?

38:47.408 --> 38:49.159
- No.
- Why not?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.786
Because it's not just the cops,
it's McPherson.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.788
McPherson?

38:53.956 --> 38:55.749
The guy that tore up your shop.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.959
He already thinks
I'm a drug dealer.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.921
Now he thinks I shot Junior.
And he has no reason to think otherwise...

39:02.089 --> 39:05.425
- ...unless I can prove it.
- Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.761
This just keeps getting
better and better.

39:08.637 --> 39:10.930
I got a spare in my toolkit.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.100
He was strangled, by the way.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.311
- Who?
- Junior.

39:16.479 --> 39:20.607
- He was strangled with a bike chain.
- Shit.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.445
Henry used the chain
off his own bike.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.784
- How do you know that?
- How do you know?

39:30.951 --> 39:33.078
Yeah, how did you know that?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.622
Well, it's...

39:35.998 --> 39:37.499
It's complicated.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.504
- You turning left, or we going to Oregon?
- It's right.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.005
It's right? What...?

39:44.173 --> 39:47.342
Get the finger out of my face.
I know where I'm going.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.722
Henry just screwed himself.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.475
- See those scratches and nicks?
- Yeah.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.019
Well, it picks them up
from the sprocket.

39:58.187 --> 40:01.231
Now, no two bikes
got the same chain-wear pattern...

40:01.399 --> 40:04.109
...because no two sprockets
are the same.

40:04.652 --> 40:08.488
So we match the chain
used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

40:09.657 --> 40:11.658
...and we got him.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.411
Like a fingerprint.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.247
Try not to move your lips
so much when you think.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.418
Now we call the cops, right?

40:22.503 --> 40:24.337
Now we call the cops.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.759
- Real cute, guys.
- Get a room.

40:40.187 --> 40:43.231
- McPherson, it's F...
- Ford. Looks like you're trading up.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.067
Going from drug trafficking
to first-degree murder.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.778
- I was set up.
- In my business I hear that a lot.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.531
- Loud. Recorder's on.
- Who wants to set you up?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.575
Henry James.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.287
Leader of the Hellions.
Now, why would he wanna do that?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.123
Those drugs you were looking for
belong to Henry.

41:00.291 --> 41:04.127
I stashed them the night before you
raided the shop. He wants them back.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.755
Tell me where the drugs are,
I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

41:07.923 --> 41:12.218
- Maybe we can work something out.
- "Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

41:12.386 --> 41:15.722
- ...then I'll take you to the drugs.
- Arrest him? On what grounds?

41:15.973 --> 41:17.307
First-degree murder.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.643
- What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry?
- Big "if."

41:20.811 --> 41:22.395
Arrest him.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.273
- Get his bike, I'll show you.
- Get his bike. Okay.

41:25.441 --> 41:29.277
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest?
Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher...?

41:29.445 --> 41:32.572
- Hold on, I'm making a list.
- You're not listening to me.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.158
- Henry killed Junior.
- I don't know that.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.327
Then you can't help me!

41:48.088 --> 41:49.923
Well, that didn't fly.

41:50.090 --> 41:53.218
Screw it. Let's haul ass down
to Mexico and don't look back.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.762
As much as I hate to say it,
I agree with him.

41:57.097 --> 42:00.433
- We're going to L.A.
- Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.353
I have to get Henry's bike.
That will clear me.

42:03.521 --> 42:07.273
They'll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast.

42:07.441 --> 42:10.109
We're not exactly hard
to spot driving these.

42:10.277 --> 42:14.489
- You wanna ditch the bikes?
- No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

42:15.783 --> 42:19.160
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy, right?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.623
I live my life a quarter
mile at a time.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.585
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.144
Po-po got the highways
blocked from here to L.A.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.813
L.A.?

42:46.981 --> 42:50.316
Why would he go to the one place
he know I got on lockdown?

42:50.484 --> 42:53.820
- Let's catch him on the interstate.
- No, he's smarter than that.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.488
He trying to backdoor us.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.574
He going through the Palms.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.994
That's the way I'd go.
And that's the way we going.

43:08.335 --> 43:13.339
Henry James did pull six months
in L.A. County last year for possession.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.009
Maybe Ford is onto something.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.431
Then you can't help me!

43:23.475 --> 43:26.019
Call in. Check everything
from Lone Pine and L.A.

43:26.186 --> 43:29.856
- You think Ford's going back to L.A.?
- He's going after Henry James.

43:30.024 --> 43:33.651
If he's right and Henry did set him up,
that's what I'd do. Let's go!

43:33.819 --> 43:36.821
- You have to pay for the gas.
- Oh, right.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.591
Reapers!

44:05.934 --> 44:08.353
- We'll lose them in the Palms!
- Are you crazy?

44:08.520 --> 44:09.979
I hate it when he does this!

44:10.147 --> 44:14.400
- They going into the trees!
- I could see that, fool! Stay on Ford.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.097
- I got his ass!
- They're shooting at us, Ford!

44:44.264 --> 44:45.625
- I know!
- What do we do?

44:45.766 --> 44:47.433
Go right! They'll follow me!

45:20.342 --> 45:22.051
Meet the twins!

45:38.819 --> 45:40.903
All right, Ford!

45:41.989 --> 45:44.073
Just you and me, baby!

46:10.684 --> 46:12.810
Shouldn't pick on girls.

49:13.659 --> 49:15.409
You all right?

49:20.040 --> 49:22.875
I just jumped my bike
onto the roof of a moving train.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.337
It's amazing what you can do
when you have no choice.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.594
Where are Val and Dalton?

49:35.097 --> 49:37.932
He had me, dog. He had me.
I was gone!

49:38.308 --> 49:41.060
He's the one snatched me up out of there!

49:41.228 --> 49:44.397
I'm trying to figure out why.
He ain't acting like no killer!

49:44.564 --> 49:47.149
Your brother's dead
and cracker's on the run.

49:47.317 --> 49:51.654
Shit don't feel right.
Don't sound right, don't look right.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.573
Only way we can find out
is to get our hands on him.

49:54.741 --> 49:57.952
- I'm with that.
- Then get your black ass up and let's go!

49:58.120 --> 49:59.745
Everybody, let's go!

50:11.258 --> 50:13.426
First time Val's
beat you anywhere!

50:13.593 --> 50:15.720
Must be the chick.

50:15.887 --> 50:18.514
Yeah, I stopped for a manicure.

50:19.808 --> 50:23.686
Want this hour's bad news?
Every major road in L.A. is blocked.

50:24.563 --> 50:27.481
I know you said it wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy...

50:27.649 --> 50:30.276
...but does it have
to be this much fun?

50:37.409 --> 50:39.827
You said you could make this
go away. How?

50:39.995 --> 50:44.206
Sometimes witnesses
forget what they saw.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.292
Refuse to testify.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.169
You still want your shit back...

50:48.336 --> 50:51.672
...I'll call you when I get to L.A.
3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.802
What?

51:01.058 --> 51:04.810
Jay, something doesn't sit with me.
Ford doesn't profile up as a killer.

51:04.978 --> 51:07.897
Yeah? Good instincts, Henderson.

51:08.065 --> 51:12.651
Listen, I gave Ford a chance
to tell the truth six months ago. He ran.

51:12.819 --> 51:15.488
I gave him another chance last night.
He ran again.

51:15.655 --> 51:20.576
Innocent men,
Henderson, don't run.

51:22.537 --> 51:23.871
He went for it!

51:24.039 --> 51:28.000
Now we just gotta get past the several
hundred cops between us and L.A.

51:28.168 --> 51:30.961
God, I hope you have
a plan this time.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.174
Yeah, I got a plan.

51:58.532 --> 52:00.699
You gonna leave without me?

52:09.584 --> 52:10.918
Oh, my God.

52:11.878 --> 52:13.879
Check it out, man.

52:14.881 --> 52:16.715
Holy shit.

52:22.722 --> 52:26.809
Seen three bikers and a chick on a couple
of crotch rockets in the last hour?

52:29.187 --> 52:31.230
Must be something in
the water up here.

52:31.398 --> 52:35.317
Okay. Words strung together
into sentences obviously bewilder you.

52:35.485 --> 52:37.403
Let me try again.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.072
Three dudes...

52:40.574 --> 52:42.658
...a girl...

52:42.826 --> 52:44.743
...and a couple of bikes.

52:44.911 --> 52:46.745
Uh...

52:46.913 --> 52:50.416
- Don't know. Seen a lot of truckers.
- Really?

52:50.792 --> 52:52.501
One girl.

52:52.878 --> 52:55.838
- Man, you should've seen the pair...
- Shut up.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.925
Does this thing work?

53:08.685 --> 53:11.604
Ford. What is wrong with you?

53:11.771 --> 53:13.480
Sorry.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.774
- Is it fried?
- Yeah.

53:26.953 --> 53:30.956
So you never actually told me
why you chose Thailand.

53:33.043 --> 53:37.254
Well, I just wanted to go someplace
that wouldn't remind me of you.

53:38.131 --> 53:39.715
Oh, yeah?

53:39.883 --> 53:42.426
How did that work out for you?

53:44.512 --> 53:47.389
- Not real well.
- No?

53:48.683 --> 53:50.935
Oh, come on, admit it.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.812
You're so glad I came back.

53:54.814 --> 53:58.651
I just had nothing better to do
this weekend.

54:02.322 --> 54:04.907
Why we stopping
in the middle of the interstate?

54:05.742 --> 54:07.076
Roadblock.

54:07.494 --> 54:10.829
Sir! You're clear. Go ahead.
Move it out.

54:11.706 --> 54:13.499
Go ahead and send the next one!

54:14.834 --> 54:17.169
Check the second one back!

54:17.337 --> 54:21.215
- Good evening, officer.
- Could you step out of the vehicle, please.

54:21.383 --> 54:25.177
- There a problem?
- No, sir. Just a routine check.

54:27.180 --> 54:30.516
- You mind opening her up?
- No, not at all.

54:38.316 --> 54:41.443
- Where you coming from?
- Barstow.

54:41.611 --> 54:45.531
- Much drier in Barstow.
- Yeah, just a little.

54:53.039 --> 54:55.457
Hey, Ed!
What are you doing back so soon?

54:55.709 --> 54:58.043
I got a race in L.A. tomorrow night.

54:58.545 --> 55:02.381
He's all right.
Regular hero here on the local circuit.

55:02.549 --> 55:05.009
- Let him through.
- Yes, sir.

55:05.343 --> 55:08.053
Hey, Ed, good luck tomorrow night.

55:09.222 --> 55:12.141
- Beat it.
- Thanks, Frank.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.719
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

55:49.220 --> 55:51.472
Ford should've called us by now.

55:54.351 --> 55:57.936
He's just having a good run.
Don't sweat it, man.

56:00.648 --> 56:02.399
We got over a mil
riding on this!

56:02.567 --> 56:06.070
We're looking at life in prison if Ford
doesn't go down as planned.

56:06.237 --> 56:07.821
Don't tell me not to sweat it.

56:11.951 --> 56:15.287
So grab yourself a candy bar
and shut your mouth.

56:29.886 --> 56:32.471
Whoo!

56:34.307 --> 56:37.476
That's a sweet hog, man.
Look at that beast!

56:38.103 --> 56:40.479
Live to ride. Or that. Yeah.

56:41.898 --> 56:43.899
Could we get a
picture of you guys?

56:44.067 --> 56:47.820
We're on a road trip, we e-mail people
on our buddy list where we're at.

56:47.987 --> 56:49.571
Could we do that?
Who's in love?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.073
- They are.
- Right there.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.700
Give me a big smile,
like you guys are human.

56:53.993 --> 56:57.121
He blinked and she blinked.
Look at this. Let's do it again.

56:57.288 --> 56:59.498
This time, no blinking.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.341
Smile.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.014
Oh, now what?

57:25.942 --> 57:28.694
It's also about financial freedom.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.449
What can I do for you?

57:33.616 --> 57:36.410
Why don't you open
up the back for me.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.539
That's a long truck.

57:46.337 --> 57:48.005
Don't touch me.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.218
- That's weird.
- What?

57:53.386 --> 57:55.012
My lock's gone.

58:19.537 --> 58:21.121
You waiting for a green light?

58:33.551 --> 58:37.221
- Let's go, make a hole!
- Truck's broke. Call a tow truck.

58:39.098 --> 58:41.767
- Are you done?
- Get in. I'm driving.

58:44.604 --> 58:45.938
Fuck the police!

58:46.105 --> 58:48.023
- Was that a threat?
- I think it was.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.518
Ford, traffic!

59:28.731 --> 59:30.983
This is why I hate four wheels.

59:31.484 --> 59:33.652
Hey, you're gonna have to
make a break!

59:33.820 --> 59:37.364
- We go together!
- You and Val can get Shane out of this!

59:37.532 --> 59:38.991
No way, I'm going with you!

59:48.167 --> 59:51.003
- No, you're not.
- Goddamn it, Ford!

59:58.886 --> 01:00:01.179
I always knew you
had a thing for me.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.057
Get her out of here!

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.523
Hey!

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.659
Watch out.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:29.541
And I'm not gonna stand for it. I wanna
return the bike. You can take it back.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.048
Whoa.

01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:40.677
What do you mean I can't bring it back?
Okay, there's only 200 miles on the bike.

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:43.055
If you say one more word...

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.480
Asshole!

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.066
Hello? Hung up again!

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.286
- Bikers.
- This is crazy! We can call backup.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:10.290
If you don't like my driving, Henderson,
you can get out and hitch.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.259
No way!

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.605
Thank God for airbags. Shut up.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:16.314
- Come on, Ford.
- You got this wrong!

01:02:32.206 --> 01:02:33.707
Damn!

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:48.513
Damn! Crazy white boy!

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.141
Look, man, I don't wanna...

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:58.190
You think you man enough
to drop that hammer?

01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:01.610
Don't want to.
I didn't kill Junior either.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.196
If I did, I would've
let you die at the tracks.

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:09.701
- Why didn't you stick around and talk?
- I didn't think this would go all that well.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.830
All right.
You didn't kill him, who did?

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:17.125
Henry James. He set me up.

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:22.422
So I'm supposed to just believe
what you say now?

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.592
Well, see for yourself.
I'm taking him down.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:30.055
You don't believe me,
you can always shoot me then.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.309
You dropped this.

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:44.069
This better be someone
with good news or money.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:48.615
What would you say if I gave you Junior's
killer and Henry's drugs at the same time?

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:51.618
Where?

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:55.789
You know the address. You busted
its doors down about six months ago.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.916
Meet me there in two hours.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.485
Crystal meth.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:35.620
I don't suppose we got
a spare set of hands?

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:46.673
- Yeah?
- Don't "yeah" me.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.633
How we doing over there?

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.635
It's just me and
the fishes, man.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:52.929
If a mermaid pops
up, I'll call you.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.187
- Just stay there at Dalton's.
- Yeah.

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:03.189
It's lovely here.

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:05.400
I'll see you in a little while.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.027
Just be careful, all right?

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:10.322
- Well, you know me.
- Yeah, that's why I'm worried.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:13.283
I'll call you when it's over.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.377
- Who the hell is that?
- I ordered pizza.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.048
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.509
- You're not kidding?
- I eat when I'm nervous.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:34.763
He eats when he's horny.
He just likes to eat.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:40.685
How you doing?

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:49.277
Seems like your
boy ain't coming.

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.572
Now what?

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.785
He'll be here. Trust me.

01:05:57.995 --> 01:06:01.539
Tell me you got a million dollars'
worth of my ice?

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.708
I'd try to be punctual.

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:06.378
You ain't Henry.

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.129
He'll be here.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:52.632
You know, I ain't exactly
known for my patience.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.393
- What's this?
- Y2K.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.272
Fastest bike in the world.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:12.277
Carbon-fiber chassis built around
a Rolls-Royce jet helicopter engine.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.947
Zero to 200 in less
than 10 seconds, huh?

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.784
I heard of these.

01:07:20.494 --> 01:07:24.456
- What's wrong with this one?
- I don't own it.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:28.626
- FBI! Hands where I can see them!
- Drop it. Hands behind your head.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.421
- You tried to set me up.
- They're here for Henry.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.299
Put the gun on the ground
and slide it to me, now.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:38.678
You're supposed to wait for Henry.
Didn't you learn anything in FBI school?

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:41.347
Ford, shut up.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.019
Those Henry's bikes?

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.146
- Yeah.
- And the meth's inside them?

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.648
- Yeah.
- Then...

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.984
...nice work.

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:56.821
Hey. Nancy Drew.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:03.578
"No. Don't shoot. Stop."

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:07.332
What a sad and sudden tragedy.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:12.045
Nice shot, by the way.
Seriously. So now...

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.006
...I get to pin this
murder on you...

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:19.094
...and, well, everyone knows
you killed Junior...

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.388
...so now
I can shoot you both.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:25.600
- Shit.
- Yeah.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:29.854
- Which one of you guys wants to go first?
- Him. Shoot him first.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.983
You sure the drugs are in there?

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.160
- Hey.
- They're wired.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.165
You put the gun on the ground
or we all go up.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.589
It's my girlfriend.
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:58.591
Hey, baby. I'm fine.

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.594
Why don't you come in?
All right.

01:09:02.429 --> 01:09:04.180
You're gonna love her.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.781
Meet my partner.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:27.245
Did you really think I was stupid enough
to walk into a trap?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.913
Wait.

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.875
Say hello, bitch.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:35.879
Shane.

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.175
Look who it is.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:44.429
Guess the lunch line's gonna be
a little shorter at family reunions.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.471
Huh, dog?

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:50.143
I should have done your ass
when I did your bitch brother.

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:52.770
Yeah, you should have.

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:55.273
Really?

01:09:57.318 --> 01:10:00.820
All right. It seems we
have ourselves a little dilemma.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.783
Give me my meth or your little girlfriend
is gonna redefine the term "airhead."

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:08.161
Now, drop that switch.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.628
Who knows, baby?

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:21.007
After a little time with us,
she might not wanna go back to Ford.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.974
Go ahead, take a moment.
We have plenty of time.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.946
Requesting backup
at 12000 North Alameda Street.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.709
Thanks.

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:47.677
No, no, no!

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.929
Hey, wait!

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:00.315
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:08.698
Now, ain't that ironic?

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.463
- You okay?
- Yeah. Where's Henry?

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:27.091
- I gotta get that bike.
- I gotta get that bitch.

01:12:27.259 --> 01:12:28.593
Damn right.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.944
- You Power Rangers all right?
- That hurt.

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:48.780
- Hey.
- Jay!

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:51.491
Bulletproof vest, asshole.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.284
Oh, shit! Let's go!

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.496
You were always a punk.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.146
- Going somewhere?
- You want some of this, bitch?

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:24.273
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:07.251
You messed with the wrong chick!

01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:17.720
Looks like you did, bitch.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.053
Need a ride?

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:43.240
- You all right?
- I'll live.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:47.203
This is Henry's sprocket.
It should match the chain...

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:50.956
Your friends just told me.
Could we maybe do this later?

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:54.710
Whoo!

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.797
All these dead white
folks around here.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.549
So it look like we done, huh?

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:08.057
- I'm sorry about your brother.
- Yeah.

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:12.603
I gotta get out of here. Me and
Johnny Law ain't on a first-name basis.

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:14.313
Hey.

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.316
- What?
- Thanks.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:21.112
Don't sweat it, man.
Just do me one favor.

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:24.824
- What's that?
- Keep your ass out of Inglewood.

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:43.259
This shop was the only thing
in the world that was really mine.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:47.638
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to save up for it?

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.807
I'm sorry, Shane.

01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:52.977
You're in the clear,
so I guess you got what you wanted.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:07.241
You're looking at the only reason
that I came back.

01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:10.202
I'm betting on more
days like that.

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.167
You know what you
could do for me, Ford?

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.672
Take me to Mexico.

01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:32.975
- Where we heading?
- South.

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:36.061
I got someone to pick up.

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.401
Let's ride.
