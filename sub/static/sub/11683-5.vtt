00:00.237 --> 00:02.802
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.403 --> 00:05.904
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.473 --> 00:09.807
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:12.076
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.144 --> 00:14.479
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.546 --> 00:16.381
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.448 --> 00:19.183
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.251 --> 00:21.152
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.254 --> 00:23.755
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.822 --> 00:25.390
Should we shoot them?

00:25.457 --> 00:27.191
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.259 --> 00:29.961
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.330
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.398 --> 00:34.265
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.333 --> 00:37.402
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.469 --> 00:39.037
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.104 --> 00:41.739
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.807 --> 00:43.541
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:50.149 --> 00:51.182
I'm gonna get you out.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.551
We got a lead.

00:53.619 --> 00:56.354
If I get Anson, would that be
enough to get Fiona out of jail?

00:56.422 --> 00:57.588
It's a start.

00:57.656 --> 00:58.923
I can be done with you
right now.

00:58.991 --> 01:00.491
Maybe you should just go ahead
and pull that trigger.

01:00.559 --> 01:01.926
You can just add me
to that list of bodies

01:01.994 --> 01:03.127
you've been dropping --
shut up. Shut up!

01:03.195 --> 01:04.328
I said shut up!

01:04.396 --> 01:06.331
I work for Anson
because if I don't,

01:06.398 --> 01:08.433
my brother dies.

01:09.868 --> 01:11.970
Rebecca, listen to me.
You hate Anson.

01:12.037 --> 01:14.806
You hate him at least as much as
we do. I saw it in your eyes.

01:14.873 --> 01:16.708
Help us take Anson down.

01:16.775 --> 01:18.142
We'll keep
your brother safe.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.577
Sorry, Sam.
It's too late.

01:19.645 --> 01:21.713
I know what it's like
to save someone close to you

01:21.780 --> 01:23.448
by selling your soul
a piece at a time.

01:23.515 --> 01:26.784
There's only one way
to finish this for good.

01:26.852 --> 01:28.753
We have to
take him down together.

01:28.821 --> 01:30.421
There's nothing you can do.

01:30.489 --> 01:31.689
You're wrong.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.091
There's nothing
I <i>won't</i> do.

01:39.498 --> 01:43.034
<i>In many ways, being a spy</i>
<i>is just like any other job.</i>

01:43.102 --> 01:46.237
<i>You get a paycheck, go to</i>
<i>meetings, return phone calls.</i>

01:46.305 --> 01:48.573
<i>And if your supervisor</i>
<i>invites you to a fancy lunch</i>

01:48.640 --> 01:49.974
<i>without telling you why,</i>

01:50.042 --> 01:52.210
<i>it's either very good news</i>
<i>or very bad.</i>

01:53.445 --> 01:54.912
You're 30 seconds late.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.314
My training officer

01:56.382 --> 01:58.282
would have booted you
out of the Agency for that.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.817
Tell you what --
I'll make it up to you.

01:59.885 --> 02:00.718
Drinks are on me.

02:03.655 --> 02:04.956
Why don't you tell me
why I'm here?

02:05.024 --> 02:06.724
Wow.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.192
I forgot
how much fun you are.

02:08.259 --> 02:12.630
There is news on your whole
"Get Fiona out of jail" project.

02:12.698 --> 02:16.134
Why do I get the feeling there's
a "but" at the end of this?

02:16.201 --> 02:17.568
There always is,
isn't there?

02:17.636 --> 02:19.337
The C.I.A.
would like her to prove

02:19.405 --> 02:22.140
that she is
a friend of the Agency

02:22.207 --> 02:24.509
before they're willing
to talk terms of a deal.

02:24.576 --> 02:25.743
"A friend of the Agency."

02:25.811 --> 02:26.878
Relax, Michael.

02:26.945 --> 02:28.446
They just want
her arms supplier.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.681
That wasn't what we talked
about, card.

02:30.749 --> 02:32.446
Well, the consensus
was that your panties would

02:32.471 --> 02:33.885
be in a bunch over this.

02:33.886 --> 02:35.820
That's why I'm here
to see you personally.

02:35.888 --> 02:37.588
That's why
I'm buying you $18 drinks.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.291
And that's why
I can tell you this --

02:40.359 --> 02:42.794
I can still
make this happen,

02:42.861 --> 02:46.130
but I need you
<i>and</i> her to play ball,

02:46.198 --> 02:49.333
and I need <i>you</i>
<i>to help convince her.</i>

02:49.401 --> 02:50.802
Do I have a choice?

02:50.869 --> 02:52.236
Not really --

02:52.304 --> 02:53.938
not if you ever want to see
your girlfriend again

02:54.006 --> 02:56.274
without a pane of glass
between the two of you.

02:56.341 --> 02:58.042
Well, I guess,
then, I'm in.

03:05.617 --> 03:07.652
Sam, there are
chairs inside, you know,

03:07.719 --> 03:09.220
where it's not
100 degrees.

03:09.288 --> 03:10.655
Yeah, I'm giving Rebecca
some space.

03:10.722 --> 03:12.390
I'm kind of terrified
of that look in her eyes,

03:12.458 --> 03:13.658
when things
aren't going her way.

03:13.725 --> 03:14.859
Still haven't found
her brother?

03:14.927 --> 03:16.761
Yeah,
I'm all buddied out, Mike --

03:16.829 --> 03:18.296
I mean,
FBI, NSA, Interpol.

03:18.363 --> 03:19.964
The whereabouts
of Mr. Trent Lang

03:20.032 --> 03:21.332
are a mystery to us all.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.234
Is she still keeping everything
close to the vest?

03:23.302 --> 03:24.268
Yeah.

03:24.336 --> 03:25.736
She won't say anything

03:25.804 --> 03:27.205
about where he disappeared from
or what spooked him,

03:27.272 --> 03:29.040
so for all I know,

03:29.108 --> 03:31.409
the guy wandered into the wrong
section of Bed Bath & Beyond.

03:31.477 --> 03:32.710
All right,
I'll go talk to her.

03:32.778 --> 03:33.778
Yeah, good luck with that,
brother.

03:39.685 --> 03:41.886
Rebecca, we need
to talk about your brother.

03:41.954 --> 03:43.488
You can't find him,
can you?

03:43.555 --> 03:46.691
I seem to remember
sparing your life so you <i>could.</i>

03:46.758 --> 03:48.659
You haven't given us
much to go on.

03:48.727 --> 03:50.027
I already told Sam

03:50.095 --> 03:52.463
I'm not letting you
gamble with my brother's life.

03:52.531 --> 03:53.965
This thing with Trent
is delicate.

03:54.032 --> 03:55.433
And I'm telling <i>you</i>

03:55.501 --> 03:58.236
that I specialize
in delicate situations.

03:58.303 --> 04:00.004
Try me.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.873
Fine.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.976
Let's just say there are some
very dangerous people after Trent.

04:05.043 --> 04:06.944
Anson found out
where Trent is hiding,

04:07.012 --> 04:09.080
and he said that
if I don't do his bidding,

04:09.148 --> 04:11.115
he'll tell these people
where Trent is.

04:11.183 --> 04:13.818
Finding your brother
might not be the only answer.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.254
These very dangerous people
might be a good start.

04:16.321 --> 04:18.221
I'm asking you
to trust me.

04:18.290 --> 04:21.959
How can I do that?

04:22.027 --> 04:23.728
How do I know
you'll keep your promise?

04:23.795 --> 04:25.263
Until he met me,

04:25.330 --> 04:27.565
Anson Fullerton was running
an international conspiracy

04:27.633 --> 04:30.334
with hundreds of operatives
and billions of dollars.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.370
And then
I swore to take him down.

04:32.437 --> 04:35.173
Now he's off hiding in some
spider hole under an assumed name,

04:35.240 --> 04:37.141
and you're
all he has left.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.644
So, you go ask him
if I keep my promises.

04:42.689 --> 04:46.689

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

04:55.476 --> 04:58.878
Last time I saw my brother
was in that club.

04:59.437 --> 05:01.304
He liked to dance?
He tended bar?

05:01.372 --> 05:02.739
I need
a little more here.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.143
Trent
was hired to do payroll.

05:06.210 --> 05:07.844
A few months in,
he figured out

05:07.912 --> 05:10.213
it was just a front
for a criminal syndicate.

05:10.281 --> 05:12.616
He tipped off the cops
and slipped town?

05:12.683 --> 05:14.951
Yeah. The police busted the boss
for racketeering.

05:15.019 --> 05:16.620
That's Wes Foster.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.822
It was his dad
who went to prison.

05:18.890 --> 05:20.590
So, Wes took over
the family business,

05:20.658 --> 05:23.326
and he's picked up a new hobby,
which is hunting my brother.

05:23.394 --> 05:26.129
He's been offering rewards,
bribing cops.

05:26.197 --> 05:27.831
Son of a bitch is obsessed.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.502
Well, you've seen him.

05:32.570 --> 05:34.371
Still not hearing
any brilliant solutions.

05:34.438 --> 05:35.572
One step at a time.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.007
First I need to figure out
a way in.

05:37.074 --> 05:38.175
Oh, good luck.

05:38.242 --> 05:40.310
Wes' organization is huge,

05:40.378 --> 05:42.412
but since the bust,
it's family only.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.314
There's always a way in.

05:44.382 --> 05:46.616
You just have to know
your target.

05:49.086 --> 05:51.454
Are you sure you're sure, Mike?
I mean, Rebecca --

05:51.522 --> 05:53.790
She needs our help. Her brother
didn't do anything wrong.

05:53.858 --> 05:54.991
We're doing this.

05:55.059 --> 05:56.426
I don't know, Mike.

05:56.494 --> 05:57.594
You got three states' worth
of gang members here.

05:57.662 --> 05:59.362
I mean, you can't
get them all busted.

05:59.430 --> 06:01.665
Maybe the old torch-and-pitchfork
routine would work, huh?

06:01.732 --> 06:03.166
You know,
round up some villagers.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.303
Just brainstorming.

06:06.370 --> 06:10.006
Forget the whole gang.
This comes down to Wes.

06:10.074 --> 06:12.876
If we convince him it was someone
else who got his father busted,

06:12.944 --> 06:14.377
Rebecca's brother
is off the hook.

06:14.445 --> 06:15.579
I just need an approach.

06:15.646 --> 06:17.180
Okay, well,
check this out.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.949
Wes' dad, Hank,
died in prison

06:19.016 --> 06:20.717
six months ago
of a heart attack.

06:20.785 --> 06:22.519
But his old cellie --

06:22.587 --> 06:24.921
he's in a work-release program
in Tallahassee.

06:24.989 --> 06:27.257
He'd be a walking encyclopedia
on Wes' dad.

06:27.325 --> 06:29.726
We get
some background info,

06:29.794 --> 06:32.195
I could approach Wes
as Hank's prison buddy.

06:32.263 --> 06:34.364
You're fine making the trip
up to Tallahassee?

06:34.432 --> 06:36.600
You'll have backup.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.101
You haven't lived

06:38.169 --> 06:39.803
till you've spent a midsummer
road trip with Nate Westen.

06:39.870 --> 06:41.972
Me and Nate
versus the ex-con? Seriously?

06:42.039 --> 06:43.206
Time is tight.

06:43.274 --> 06:44.541
I need to stay here
and make the approach

06:44.609 --> 06:46.142
as soon as
we've got some info.

06:46.210 --> 06:48.178
Hey, if you want, you can babysit
Rebecca. I'll go with Nate.

06:48.246 --> 06:50.647
No, no, no. Thank you.
Bring on the ex-con.

06:52.514 --> 06:53.792
<i>Unlike common criminals,</i>

06:53.793 --> 06:55.586
<i>spies are trained</i>
<i>to work with their captors</i>

06:55.587 --> 06:57.321
<i>to negotiate their own release.</i>

06:57.389 --> 06:59.223
<i>In most cases,</i>
<i>it simply requires</i>

06:59.291 --> 07:02.159
<i>staying calm, relaxed, and</i>
<i>being as helpful as possible.</i>

07:02.678 --> 07:04.312
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it's a lot more difficult</i>

07:04.379 --> 07:07.043
<i>when the person standing across</i>
<i>from you is someone you hate.</i>

07:07.498 --> 07:09.166
I realize
that working with us

07:09.233 --> 07:12.302
is more akin to a shotgun wedding
than a romantic courtship,

07:12.370 --> 07:15.105
but you have
done it before.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.140
Well, that was
for Michael, not you.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.609
I get it -- you're not joining
my fan club anytime soon.

07:19.677 --> 07:21.478
It's sad,
but I've come to terms with it.

07:21.546 --> 07:22.946
Listen to me carefully,
please.

07:23.014 --> 07:25.048
The deal that
Michael Westen's been offered

07:25.116 --> 07:29.419
has a solid shot
to get you out of here.

07:29.487 --> 07:31.555
I'm just trying to help.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.091
Last time you helped me, you
pulled Michael out of Ireland

07:34.158 --> 07:35.592
without
so much as a goodbye.

07:35.660 --> 07:36.960
I'll tell you what --

07:37.028 --> 07:39.296
why don't we go ahead
and focus on the present, okay?

07:41.099 --> 07:42.265
Peruse that.

07:46.938 --> 07:50.974
You want my help
bringing down Greyson Miller.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.442
Putting him out of business

07:52.510 --> 07:54.878
would make certain
middle eastern allies happy,

07:54.946 --> 07:56.813
which would
make the Agency happy,

07:56.881 --> 07:58.515
which could
make you <i>very</i> happy.

07:58.583 --> 08:02.052
It's just
a great big circle of bliss.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.019
Do you love it?

08:05.723 --> 08:07.424
What does Michael
say about all this?

08:07.492 --> 08:08.792
I'll be honest with you.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.428
At first, he wasn't thrilled
with this proposition,

08:11.496 --> 08:14.131
but he realizes that this deal
is your ticket home.

08:14.198 --> 08:17.434
And that's
where he wants you -- home.

08:17.502 --> 08:19.336
Fine.
I'll do it.

08:21.139 --> 08:22.672
I need to make arrangements
to reach Greyson.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.074
Let's get into it, then.

08:24.142 --> 08:26.376
I need you to call Michael's
mother and tell her to bring

08:26.444 --> 08:28.111
the picture frame
that I gave her last year.

08:28.179 --> 08:30.447
A photo frame.

08:30.515 --> 08:31.715
I don't want to know, do I?

08:33.951 --> 08:34.951
Got it.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.260
Next time we drive 500 miles

08:44.328 --> 08:46.029
to interrogate
some dead guy's ex-cellmate,

08:46.097 --> 08:47.364
we're taking my car.

08:47.431 --> 08:49.299
I mean, these seats
are as hard as a park bench.

08:51.068 --> 08:54.171
This is a high-performance
machine, Nate, okay?

08:54.238 --> 08:56.072
Could your car have got us here
in less than six hours?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.408
I -- I don't think so.

08:58.476 --> 09:01.077
Well, at least I wouldn't have
to listen to five hours of Queen.

09:01.145 --> 09:03.113
Now you're gonna dog my playlist.
It's shrilly.

09:03.181 --> 09:05.715
If by "shrilly," you mean "angelic,"
then I agree with you.

09:05.783 --> 09:09.653
Wait a minute.
Look who's here.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.021
Here we go.

09:17.762 --> 09:20.363
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

09:20.431 --> 09:21.398
Whatever you're selling,
I don't want any.

09:21.465 --> 09:22.499
You Butch McCall?

09:22.567 --> 09:24.201
How you doing?
Ben Wexler.

09:24.268 --> 09:25.936
This is
my associate Sam Baum.

09:26.003 --> 09:28.104
We're with the National Institute of
Prisoner Psychology.

09:28.172 --> 09:30.874
We're going around conducting
interviews with former inmates.

09:30.942 --> 09:33.777
We just need about --
Not interested. Now, get lost.

09:33.845 --> 09:35.378
Now, Mr. McCall,
you should know

09:35.446 --> 09:37.781
that anyone who participates
in the study will receive --

09:37.849 --> 09:39.149
$500, sir.

09:39.217 --> 09:41.184
$500.
And that's in your pocket. Cash.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.252
$500.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.520
So now all you got to do

09:43.588 --> 09:45.488
is answer some questions
about your old cellmate.

09:45.556 --> 09:47.090
I believe
his name is Hank Foster.

09:47.158 --> 09:50.961
You have me confused
with somebody who gives a damn!

09:51.028 --> 09:52.529
Now get lost.

09:52.597 --> 09:54.497
Hey!

09:54.565 --> 09:56.600
Aah!

09:56.667 --> 09:58.068
Oh!

10:01.372 --> 10:03.940
Ohh!

10:04.008 --> 10:05.475
Ohh!

10:05.543 --> 10:07.077
Okay, no, that's good.
Okay, that's --

10:07.144 --> 10:09.613
someone just got their first
lesson in cattle-prod safety --

10:09.680 --> 10:11.047
two hands, dude.
Two hands.

10:11.115 --> 10:12.315
Two hands.

10:13.551 --> 10:14.751
How you feeling, butch?

10:15.920 --> 10:17.087
Still tingles a little bit,
right?

10:17.154 --> 10:19.022
Who the hell are you people?

10:19.090 --> 10:20.323
That's a good question.

10:20.391 --> 10:24.394
Um, I guess technically
we are researchers, right?

10:24.462 --> 10:27.163
We're just not from the National
Institute of... whatever the hell I said.

10:27.231 --> 10:28.565
That was a lie.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.667
We just have a few questions
about your old cellmate.

10:30.735 --> 10:32.269
Anyone
who been in the joint know

10:32.336 --> 10:34.471
you don't snitch about anything to anyone.
Right, right.

10:34.538 --> 10:36.373
What happens
in Union Correctional

10:36.440 --> 10:37.941
<i>stays</i> in Union Correctional.

10:38.009 --> 10:39.676
Look, man,
we're not the cops.

10:39.744 --> 10:41.344
We just want to know a
little more about Hank, okay --

10:41.412 --> 10:43.580
his likes, his dislikes,
his habits,

10:43.648 --> 10:45.515
his thoughts on global warming.

10:45.583 --> 10:48.385
Yeah, and what if I decide to
tell you to kiss my ass? Then what?

10:50.221 --> 10:52.856
Just remember,
you're protecting a dead guy.

10:52.924 --> 10:54.090
I mean,
is it really worth it?

11:00.231 --> 11:01.665
You still offering the $500?

11:04.302 --> 11:07.003
Well, that depends on
how helpful you're feeling.

11:12.143 --> 11:14.644
He said the prison gangs
left him alone after that.

11:14.712 --> 11:17.080
So, Hank's cell
was at this end.

11:17.148 --> 11:18.281
He used to play backgammon

11:18.349 --> 11:20.116
with the, uh,
dudes from his cellblock

11:20.184 --> 11:21.451
at these tables right here.

11:21.519 --> 11:23.086
The laundry room
was over here at this end.

11:23.154 --> 11:25.755
That's where
Hank had his heart attack.

11:25.823 --> 11:28.191
Great. Anything else?
Um, nope.

11:28.259 --> 11:32.128
I think that pretty much brings
Skype storytime to an end.

11:32.196 --> 11:34.097
All right, you should pack up and
get out of there as fast as you can.

11:34.165 --> 11:35.398
Will do.

11:35.466 --> 11:37.600
Hey, Mike, he said
Hank was one tough bastard,

11:37.668 --> 11:39.669
so I doubt
his son's gonna be a pushover.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.171
You sure you got enough info
to sell your cover?

11:41.238 --> 11:42.739
I'll make it work.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.579
<i>Selling a cover</i>
<i>as a former convict</i>

11:49.647 --> 11:50.947
<i>is about the little things --</i>

11:51.015 --> 11:52.615
<i>the habits you learn in prison,</i>

11:52.683 --> 11:54.584
<i>things like</i>
<i>wearing shoes without laces,</i>

11:54.652 --> 11:57.053
<i>refusing</i>
<i>to make direct eye contact,</i>

11:57.121 --> 12:00.757
<i>and asking permission before</i>
<i>doing even the most basic task.</i>

12:00.825 --> 12:02.025
I couldn't believe it.

12:02.093 --> 12:03.994
I'm sorry.
I don't -- I --

12:04.061 --> 12:07.564
I was hoping to speak with
Mr. Foster, if that's okay.

12:07.631 --> 12:09.399
I-I don't mean to intrude.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.400
It's a little late for that.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.802
The name's Freddie Kupfer.

12:12.870 --> 12:17.574
I was in your dad's backgammon
club, you know, upstate.

12:17.641 --> 12:21.544
I was hoping that we could
privately conversate.

12:21.612 --> 12:22.979
We're already
conversing privately.

12:23.047 --> 12:24.347
You just
haven't said anything yet.

12:24.415 --> 12:25.749
Fair enough.

12:25.816 --> 12:28.351
Your dad wanted me to give you
a message when I got out.

12:28.419 --> 12:29.786
It's about
how he got pinched.

12:29.854 --> 12:30.920
Oh, damn it, Wes.

12:30.988 --> 12:32.589
Don't let this guy
ruin our meal.

12:32.656 --> 12:35.925
What, you running some sort of
scam, looking for a handout?

12:35.993 --> 12:37.827
No scam, nope...

12:37.895 --> 12:39.162
although Hank did say

12:39.230 --> 12:41.798
that you might be able
to slide me some startup cash,

12:41.866 --> 12:44.434
like you did for your
Uncle David when he got out.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.202
Was that supposed to be
on the D.L.? Sorry.

12:46.270 --> 12:47.937
Why don't you tell me
what my dad said?

12:48.005 --> 12:49.406
And I'll decide
what it's worth.

12:49.473 --> 12:50.707
Your dad said,

12:50.775 --> 12:54.377
"Wes needs to know
he's chasing the wrong guy.

12:54.445 --> 12:57.547
It wasn't Trent
that dropped the dime."

12:57.615 --> 12:59.182
<i>When making an approach,</i>

12:59.250 --> 13:01.751
<i>solid intelligence is often</i>
<i>just a starting point.</i>

13:01.819 --> 13:04.988
Scam or not, it sure sounds
like a fairy tale.

13:05.056 --> 13:08.058
<i>Gauging the different reactions of </i>
<i>your target and those around him</i>

13:08.125 --> 13:09.759
<i>can help you</i>
<i>fill in the blanks.</i>

13:10.231 --> 13:12.365
<i>While you may already know how</i>
<i>a man feels about his dad...</i>

13:12.433 --> 13:14.835
Seriously? You're --
you're kicking me out?

13:14.902 --> 13:16.236
Hank said
that you two were tight.

13:16.304 --> 13:17.704
Hank said
that you were just like him.

13:17.772 --> 13:19.806
<i>...keeping your eyes open</i>
<i>can also tell you</i>

13:19.874 --> 13:21.208
<i>about how that man's wife</i>

13:21.275 --> 13:23.977
<i>really felt</i>
<i>about her father-in-law.</i>

13:24.045 --> 13:25.979
I'll tell you
another thing he said.

13:26.047 --> 13:28.114
He said his champ
would be all over this,

13:28.182 --> 13:30.984
though he didn't think the wife
would let you off the leash.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.552
Come on.

13:32.620 --> 13:36.523
Rob...hold on a second.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.925
Are you serious, Wes?
Get rid of this loser.

13:38.993 --> 13:41.528
Let me handle it.

13:43.130 --> 13:45.232
You should watch your mouth.

13:45.299 --> 13:47.968
These were Hank's words,
not mine. I apologize.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.336
Speak fast.
All right.

13:49.403 --> 13:50.704
There was this ex-D.A.,

13:50.771 --> 13:52.539
paper pusher,
doing time with us.

13:52.607 --> 13:55.408
Some of the other guys
would work him over pretty good.

13:55.476 --> 13:58.044
He let slip that the cops
had a secret informant on you,

13:58.112 --> 13:59.746
someone
you didn't even know about.

13:59.814 --> 14:02.148
That's all you got?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.650
Sorry. That's not enough.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.818
Wait. Wait.
That's all I got?

14:04.886 --> 14:05.952
Who said that's all I got?

14:06.020 --> 14:07.254
He also said
there was a file,

14:07.321 --> 14:10.257
a file in some warehouse
in Overtown, I think,

14:10.324 --> 14:12.859
that should tell you
who the snitch is.

14:12.927 --> 14:14.861
And how do I
get to see this file?

14:14.929 --> 14:16.196
You could ask nicely,

14:16.264 --> 14:18.164
but I could also
offer my services

14:18.232 --> 14:20.800
as a procurement specialist.

14:22.336 --> 14:23.336
A thief.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.373
Yeah. I got it. Thanks.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.641
Fine. You got a job.

14:27.708 --> 14:30.010
You earn your keep,
it pays pretty good.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.980
But if you're playing some game,
I will bury your ass alive.

14:34.048 --> 14:36.550
I'll tell you what --
if I don't come through,

14:36.617 --> 14:38.418
I'll grab a shovel
and help you dig.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.217
Okay, how many
of these have I had,

14:43.218 --> 14:44.552
'cause it sounded like
you just promised Wes

14:44.620 --> 14:46.387
you're gonna bust into
a police storage facility,

14:46.455 --> 14:48.364
and I know
you're not brain-damaged.

14:48.464 --> 14:50.098
I had to
offer him something.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.467
Wes needs proof,
and he's not gonna believe me

14:52.535 --> 14:54.069
unless
he has to work for it.

14:54.137 --> 14:57.372
Anson kills my brother
if this isn't done delicately.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.474
Getting arrested
is not an option.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.043
Nobody's getting arrested.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.812
I just need you two to plant
a file for Wes and me to find,

15:03.880 --> 15:05.680
and I will handle this
<i>delicately.</i>

15:05.748 --> 15:08.450
Okay, Mike, I can back-date
some C.I.A. payment invoices

15:08.518 --> 15:10.519
and fudge
some operation status reports.

15:10.586 --> 15:11.620
Who we setting up?

15:11.687 --> 15:13.655
Just say
"unnamed informant"

15:13.723 --> 15:16.258
and point everything
away from Trent.

15:16.325 --> 15:18.693
Let Wes spend the rest of his
life tearing his team apart

15:18.761 --> 15:20.429
trying to figure out
who betrayed him.

15:20.496 --> 15:23.031
There you have it.
Go, team.

15:23.099 --> 15:24.999
Yeah, why don't you just
promise him a walk on the

15:25.024 --> 15:26.034
moon while you're at it?

15:26.035 --> 15:28.036
If that will prevent them
from hunting your brother,

15:28.104 --> 15:28.937
it's on the table.

15:31.107 --> 15:32.307
Don't get him started.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.276
I don't have
any buddies at NASA.

15:37.847 --> 15:41.016
This place is amazing.
Bro, wow.

15:41.084 --> 15:43.385
I mean,
it reminds me of that movie

15:43.453 --> 15:46.221
where the ex-con
gets mistook for a rich guy

15:46.289 --> 15:49.691
and there's a cowboy hat
and there's a monkey that --

15:49.759 --> 15:52.727
oh, actually, I think that was a TV show.
I didn't see it.

15:52.795 --> 15:54.596
It means
you're doing good for yourself.

15:54.664 --> 15:57.833
What can I say? My wife has good taste.
Mm.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.368
Seriously, you couldn't have
met up at the nightclub?

16:00.436 --> 16:02.370
Cut him some slack.
He's a guest.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.808
Sorry. That -- that just...

16:06.876 --> 16:10.879
Well, tell your "guest"
not to touch anything else.

16:10.947 --> 16:12.314
I have a friend
who can fix this.

16:12.381 --> 16:13.381
He owns a machine shop.

16:13.449 --> 16:14.683
Don't worry about it.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.451
It's better if you
stay out of her way for now.

16:16.519 --> 16:17.853
Come on.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.224
I didn't put all this up
overnight.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.726
This is
years of blood and sweat.

16:24.794 --> 16:26.695
You saying
this is all for nothing?

16:26.762 --> 16:28.697
It's the cops.
It's how they do it.

16:28.764 --> 16:31.032
You're busy, uh,
chasing this, uh, Trent guy

16:31.100 --> 16:33.702
while the real informant
gets to breathe easy.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.670
Which would mean
this is all lies.

16:35.738 --> 16:36.805
Not lies.

16:36.873 --> 16:38.673
You know how
when we were in school,

16:38.741 --> 16:41.409
when you put <i>your</i> name
on the smart kid's test?

16:42.945 --> 16:44.412
I did.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.615
This stuff happened.
It just wasn't Trent.

16:46.682 --> 16:48.817
If my dad knew about this,
why didn't he say anything?

16:48.885 --> 16:50.585
Well, why didn't he
talk to our lawyers?

16:50.653 --> 16:52.487
He was
putting it all together,

16:52.555 --> 16:54.189
but then
his heart stopped.

16:54.257 --> 16:57.259
Maybe he would have told you,
but you didn't visit him

16:57.326 --> 16:59.561
the last few months
he was on the inside.

17:02.865 --> 17:05.599
Tell me
about this police warehouse.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.935
I got a guy
who works at city hall.

17:08.003 --> 17:09.570
He mops the floors.

17:09.638 --> 17:13.742
Now, when we were kids, he --
he blew his pinky clean off.

17:13.809 --> 17:15.510
We used to call him --

17:15.578 --> 17:17.012
this is not the point.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.480
He was able to pull

17:18.548 --> 17:21.082
the blueprints
and the work schedules.

17:21.150 --> 17:24.786
Now, if we enter the warehouse
here, between swing shifts,

17:24.854 --> 17:27.255
we'll be able to
grab the files and bolt --

17:27.323 --> 17:28.490
less than a minute.

17:28.558 --> 17:30.358
And you're sure
that file will be there.

17:30.426 --> 17:32.194
I have never been sure-er.

17:37.596 --> 17:39.864
<i>Budget constraints force</i>
<i>most government offices</i>

17:39.932 --> 17:41.265
<i>to manage their files</i>

17:41.333 --> 17:44.669
<i>using rigid,</i>
<i>out-of-date filing systems.</i>

17:44.736 --> 17:46.704
<i>The constant glitches</i>
<i>and lack of technical support</i>

17:47.477 --> 17:49.044
<i>give you a great opportunity</i>

17:49.112 --> 17:51.446
<i>to sidestep the normal</i>
<i>rules and procedures.</i>

17:51.543 --> 17:52.415
How you doing there?

17:52.416 --> 17:55.151
Uh, this little devil didn't
get back into the file box --

17:55.219 --> 17:57.620
case number 08-52979.

17:57.688 --> 17:59.656
Can you make sure
it finds its way back home?

17:59.723 --> 18:00.923
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

18:03.894 --> 18:06.596
Case is closed. Doesn't
say anything about new files.

18:06.664 --> 18:08.731
Ah, well, it'll be under
Detective Finley.

18:08.799 --> 18:10.400
Should come up
in a few hours.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.135
Or next June.
You know how it is.

18:13.737 --> 18:16.506
Sorry. Can't file this
without proper authorization.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.207
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if you run into someone</i>

18:18.275 --> 18:20.209
<i>who insists on doing things</i>
<i>by the book,</i>

18:20.277 --> 18:22.979
<i>you better know how to bend</i>
<i>those same rules in your favor.</i>

18:23.047 --> 18:24.814
Okay, listen, uh,
we need your help here, see,

18:24.882 --> 18:25.782
'cause I'm a --

18:25.849 --> 18:27.517
An idiot.

18:27.584 --> 18:28.618
An idiot who's gonna
get us both suspended.

18:28.686 --> 18:31.554
Well, I need
supervisor approvals.

18:31.622 --> 18:34.057
Hey, eyes up here,
little man.

18:34.124 --> 18:35.491
He's already on my bad side.

18:35.559 --> 18:37.560
And if you don't want
to end up there, too,

18:37.628 --> 18:39.896
you'll quit looking down
my shirt and take the damn file.

18:39.963 --> 18:42.598
I...wasn't, ma'am.

18:42.666 --> 18:45.168
You can't bend the rules
for your precious file room,

18:45.235 --> 18:46.736
but sexual harassment's okay.

18:46.804 --> 18:49.238
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'll file it.

18:49.306 --> 18:50.406
Just go.

18:56.980 --> 18:58.348
You know, you're, uh --

18:58.415 --> 19:00.016
If you say "pretty when you're
angry," I'll break your jaw.

19:00.084 --> 19:01.417
No, I was gonna go with
"terrifying."

19:08.625 --> 19:10.727
Look who I found
in the visitors center.

19:10.794 --> 19:12.261
Hi.

19:12.329 --> 19:14.797
Honey, what happened?

19:14.865 --> 19:17.467
It's fine. It's nothing.
It's good to see you.

19:17.534 --> 19:20.103
You too.

19:20.170 --> 19:22.038
Well, you'll be home soon,
right?

19:22.106 --> 19:23.172
That's what this is all about,
isn't it --

19:23.240 --> 19:24.307
getting out of here?

19:24.375 --> 19:25.842
And the quicker
we get going,

19:25.909 --> 19:28.077
the faster she'll be eating some
of your world-famous meat loaf.

19:28.145 --> 19:29.579
Would you back off?

19:29.646 --> 19:30.847
I am just concerned

19:30.914 --> 19:32.682
with national security,
Fiona's freedom,

19:32.750 --> 19:34.984
and getting a dangerous
gun-runner off the street,

19:35.052 --> 19:37.420
but by all means,
you take your time.

19:37.488 --> 19:39.622
Is he always like this?

19:39.690 --> 19:41.257
Yeah.
Did you bring it?

19:41.325 --> 19:44.160
Yeah. I hope this is
still what you're looking for.

19:44.228 --> 19:48.297
Um, I deleted some pictures
of you and Michael on the beach.

19:48.365 --> 19:50.066
Nate kept sending
all these photos of the baby,

19:50.134 --> 19:51.167
and I needed
to make some room.

19:51.235 --> 19:52.135
I'm sorry.

19:53.537 --> 19:57.073
It's okay. There are
no secret messages in my photos.

20:02.146 --> 20:04.947
Encrypted data card --

20:05.015 --> 20:08.284
basically just a phone book
for all my contacts.

20:08.352 --> 20:09.719
Should I, uh,
be running a metal detector

20:09.787 --> 20:11.354
over the throw pillow
you gave me?

20:11.422 --> 20:14.257
Uh, no.
No, that was just a pillow.

20:14.324 --> 20:16.225
All right, then,
this, uh, little toy

20:16.293 --> 20:18.161
will make it seem
as though your call

20:18.228 --> 20:20.129
is coming from
your very own cellphone,

20:20.197 --> 20:21.364
somewhere in South Miami.

20:21.432 --> 20:22.698
My operative's in place.

20:22.766 --> 20:24.600
You just get Greyson
to the meeting.

20:24.668 --> 20:26.903
Officially, Fiona Glenanne
was never arrested,

20:26.970 --> 20:28.271
so Greyson should buy it.

20:28.338 --> 20:30.072
Greyson will want to do this
his way.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.340
It would be a lot easier

20:31.408 --> 20:33.176
if you'd let me
handle him in person.

20:33.243 --> 20:35.044
The warden's
not gonna be too eager

20:35.112 --> 20:37.947
for you to be having
an afternoon stroll all by yourself.

20:38.015 --> 20:39.715
We're gonna use
my operative.

20:39.783 --> 20:41.017
I brought you
a cheat sheet

20:41.084 --> 20:43.553
so you can get
all the details just right.

20:44.988 --> 20:46.722
Can I take
my frame back now?

20:46.790 --> 20:47.790
I wish you would.
Uh-huh.

20:47.858 --> 20:49.592
Fiona,
let's make that call.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.227
Speakerphone, please.

20:55.966 --> 20:56.833
Glenanne.

20:59.970 --> 21:01.871
Been a while.
I've been out of the country.

21:01.939 --> 21:03.406
I need
to put some cash together.

21:03.474 --> 21:05.174
The last shipment
that I bought from you --

21:05.242 --> 21:06.142
I need to sell it back.

21:07.611 --> 21:09.512
All right. Five grand.

21:09.580 --> 21:12.281
Five?
It's worth 10 times that.

21:12.349 --> 21:14.116
Okay. How does...

21:14.184 --> 21:15.518
Five grand sound?

21:20.524 --> 21:22.391
You're a bastard.
Did you know that?

21:22.459 --> 21:24.293
Well, sounds like
you're in a bind.

21:24.361 --> 21:25.394
Take it or leave it.

21:25.462 --> 21:26.896
Fine.

21:26.964 --> 21:30.399
My associate Steven Delprete
will meet you.

21:30.467 --> 21:32.068
Don't know him.
Won't work with him.

21:32.135 --> 21:34.770
It's you or Michael,
or no deal.

21:34.838 --> 21:37.173
Fine.
Michael, then.

21:37.241 --> 21:39.742
I'll text you
the details.

21:41.612 --> 21:43.813
Sounds like
a barrel of laughs.

21:43.881 --> 21:45.915
Would you like to tell Michael,
or should I?

21:45.983 --> 21:47.116
You need the number?

21:47.184 --> 21:48.885
No, I have Michael's number
right here.

21:51.688 --> 21:54.223
Look, I won't be able to stop
the alarm from going off,

21:54.291 --> 21:55.791
so we'll have about a minute

21:55.859 --> 21:58.895
before this place
turns into cop central.

22:02.566 --> 22:04.867
This place is huge.
There won't be enough time.

22:06.069 --> 22:09.872
Just keep moving.
We'll be fine.

22:11.174 --> 22:15.044
<i>Explosive breaching is usually the </i>
<i>fastest way into any building,</i>

22:15.101 --> 22:17.269
<i>but it isn't exactly</i>
<i>the most subtle.</i>

22:17.982 --> 22:19.683
<i>When a softer touch</i>
<i>is required,</i>

22:20.068 --> 22:21.469
<i>a compact hydraulic wedge</i>

22:22.037 --> 22:24.238
<i>can quickly pry a door</i>
<i>away from its frame</i>

22:24.306 --> 22:27.808
<i>without waking up the neighbors</i>
<i>or singeing off your eyebrows.</i>

22:29.042 --> 22:30.576
Let's move.
Clock's ticking.

22:31.645 --> 22:33.345
Precinct 234, right?

22:34.748 --> 22:36.182
Looks like
it's organized by year.

22:36.249 --> 22:38.584
08-52979 --

22:38.652 --> 22:40.486
the song I've been singing
for the last three years.

22:46.593 --> 22:48.894
What are you doing?
Just take the whole box.

22:48.962 --> 22:50.362
I got to make sure
the file's here.

22:50.430 --> 22:51.664
Well, hurry up!

22:51.731 --> 22:54.200
Back off and keep watch,
will you?

22:54.267 --> 22:55.501
Gotcha.

22:57.504 --> 22:59.171
Time's up.
We got company.

23:02.075 --> 23:04.843
Back up. Back up.
He'll see us.

23:04.911 --> 23:06.645
I'll take care of it.
No, no, no, no. No way.

23:06.713 --> 23:08.380
You know why
I only spent five years in jail?

23:08.448 --> 23:10.182
It's 'cause I didn't
point my gun at anybody.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.984
I'm not gonna have him
see my face.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:34.574 --> 23:37.009
Don't fight it.
Don't fight it. Relax.

23:42.215 --> 23:43.616
See?
He didn't see your face.

23:43.683 --> 23:44.683
Happy?

23:44.751 --> 23:46.285
Let's get the hell
out of here.

23:52.659 --> 23:55.427
Oh, that
doesn't look promising at all.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.800
Well,
what are we doing up here?

24:01.801 --> 24:03.386
Oh, I thought
you'd like the view.

24:03.389 --> 24:05.290
You don't know anything
about cops, do you?

24:05.358 --> 24:07.025
They have to
search the whole building

24:07.093 --> 24:08.260
before they come up here.

24:08.328 --> 24:11.096
Just calm down
and let me think.

24:12.732 --> 24:14.333
Yeah?
I think we're screwed.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.568
You're the one who was taking
your sweet time in there.

24:19.472 --> 24:21.362
They're everywhere. I say
we go back down and grab

24:21.387 --> 24:22.374
the guard that you took down.

24:22.375 --> 24:24.443
At least we have a hostage that way.
And risk being spotted?

24:24.510 --> 24:26.378
The only thing
going for us right now

24:26.446 --> 24:28.180
is we haven't
been seen yet.

24:28.248 --> 24:30.115
Oh, that cat's gonna be
out of the bag pretty quick.

24:30.183 --> 24:32.050
Fastest way back to the car
is straight ahead.

24:32.118 --> 24:33.986
All we got to do
is get the cops to move.

24:34.053 --> 24:35.754
I have a buddy
who lives around here.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.623
Creating distractions is --

24:37.690 --> 24:40.592
well, let's just say it's --
hey. Uh, Chuck?

24:40.660 --> 24:42.928
Yeah, yeah, it's me. Listen,
I'm gonna cut right to it.

24:42.996 --> 24:44.496
I have
a little bit of a problem.

24:44.564 --> 24:46.331
Yeah, no kidding, Mike. What
the hell's going on in there?

24:46.399 --> 24:48.433
Look,
I'm at that cop-record place

24:48.501 --> 24:50.535
around the corner from you.

24:50.603 --> 24:52.504
Look, I set off
these big air-raid sirens.

24:52.572 --> 24:54.539
Pigs haven't seen us yet.
How much time you got?

24:54.607 --> 24:57.376
Well, we're on the roof.
I'd say maybe 10 minutes.

24:57.443 --> 25:00.049
So, I need you to create
a big distraction on

25:00.074 --> 25:01.847
the northwest corner,

25:01.848 --> 25:03.682
give the cops
something else to think about.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.117
Yeah, we're on it.
Sit tight, buddy.

25:09.222 --> 25:11.023
Great.
Now what are we gonna do?

25:11.090 --> 25:12.791
I thought Mike
knew what he was doing, huh?

25:12.859 --> 25:14.226
This is a disaster.

25:14.294 --> 25:16.895
Don't get ahead of yourself.
It's only a pre-disaster.

25:16.963 --> 25:19.097
Now, look, Mike wants
a distraction, right?

25:19.165 --> 25:21.133
So, we'll set off an alarm
in the impound yard.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.168
The cops will think
Mike escaped the building.

25:23.236 --> 25:25.771
Brilliant. So, <i>we</i> get chased
by the cops instead.

25:25.838 --> 25:27.039
I didn't say
the plan was perfect.

25:29.609 --> 25:31.343
What are you doing?
What's that for?

25:31.411 --> 25:33.378
It's one of those
friendship bracelets.

25:33.446 --> 25:35.347
What's it look like?!
It's our way off the roof.

25:35.415 --> 25:37.716
I thought you said you had a buddy --
He's gonna give us an opening.

25:37.784 --> 25:39.318
And when he does,
we're gonna have to get down

25:39.385 --> 25:40.419
as quick as we can.

25:40.486 --> 25:42.387
Like gym class,
all right?

25:45.158 --> 25:47.592
Not a good time.

25:47.660 --> 25:49.328
Michael, I've been calling you.
I need your help.

25:49.395 --> 25:50.462
What's --
what's going on?

25:50.530 --> 25:52.464
It's this thing
Card wants me to do.

25:52.532 --> 25:53.332
Fi, he is
trying to help you.

25:53.399 --> 25:55.300
Yeah, I know.

25:55.368 --> 25:57.169
The problem is, Greyson will
only make the deal with <i>you.</i>

25:57.236 --> 25:58.870
Can you meet him
this afternoon?

25:58.938 --> 26:00.005
I'm kind of
in a tough spot right now.

26:00.073 --> 26:01.239
Could we do it tomorrow?

26:01.307 --> 26:02.574
No, he won't budge.
It's now or never.

26:06.045 --> 26:07.179
Fi?

26:08.047 --> 26:10.549
So quiet.

26:10.616 --> 26:12.017
Must be serious.

26:12.085 --> 26:13.151
Yeah, I, uh --

26:13.219 --> 26:14.653
Michael, I understand.
It's okay.

26:14.721 --> 26:15.721
I'll get it done.

26:15.788 --> 26:16.955
I know you'll try,

26:17.023 --> 26:19.191
but you can't
be everywhere all the time.

26:20.893 --> 26:22.561
I wish I was there
to back you up.

26:22.628 --> 26:25.997
That's enough. Look it, I hate
to interrupt this lovefest.

26:26.065 --> 26:27.866
We only have one shot here,

26:27.934 --> 26:30.296
so I need you to abandon
whatever Reindeer Games

26:30.321 --> 26:31.503
you're currently involved in

26:31.504 --> 26:33.105
and get on this.

26:33.172 --> 26:35.207
I'm going as fast as I can.

26:39.612 --> 26:41.480
You got time to make phone calls
now? Who the hell was that?

26:41.547 --> 26:44.649
Just a girl, on again,
off again, jail again --

26:44.717 --> 26:47.285
long story
that we don't have time for.

26:51.224 --> 26:54.760
<i>The mistake people make in</i>
<i>trying to deal with a guard dog</i>

26:54.827 --> 26:57.162
<i>is trying to deal</i>
<i>with a guard dog.</i>

26:57.230 --> 26:59.496
<i>A well-trained German</i>
<i>Shepherd can run nearly</i>

26:59.521 --> 27:00.732
<i>30 miles an hour,</i>

27:00.733 --> 27:02.334
<i>jump about 5 feet vertically,</i>

27:02.402 --> 27:04.269
<i>and bite with more than</i>
<i>500 pounds of pressure.</i>

27:08.341 --> 27:10.075
All right. Ladies first.

27:10.143 --> 27:11.610
You're such a gentleman.

27:11.677 --> 27:12.644
Yeah?
Wait till you get the bill

27:12.712 --> 27:13.578
to repair my trunk liner.

27:23.823 --> 27:26.525
<i>Trying to distract a dog</i>
<i>may seem like a good idea,</i>

27:26.592 --> 27:28.427
<i>but it usually just delays</i>

27:28.494 --> 27:29.961
<i>by a few seconds.</i>

27:30.029 --> 27:32.564
<i>The best strategy is to stay</i>
<i>as far away as possible</i>

27:32.632 --> 27:35.333
<i>and, if you can,</i>
<i>put some solid steel</i>

27:35.401 --> 27:37.169
<i>between you and the animal.</i>

27:37.236 --> 27:39.938
Get in there.
That dog looks hungry.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.306
All right,
all right, all right.

27:42.708 --> 27:46.044
Oh, that's nice.

27:46.112 --> 27:47.546
Yeah, thanks for that.

27:47.613 --> 27:49.915
What are you, a size 12?

27:49.982 --> 27:51.283
11.

27:52.952 --> 27:54.753
Still remember what you're
doing there, grandpa?

27:54.821 --> 27:57.122
Trust me -- best hands
east of the Mississippi.

27:57.190 --> 27:58.857
Just give me one second.

28:02.361 --> 28:03.962
M-maybe two.

28:05.665 --> 28:07.799
There we go.
Buckle up.

28:11.938 --> 28:13.672
That's not gonna keep
those cops back much longer.

28:13.739 --> 28:15.307
Don't worry.
Here comes the cavalry.

28:20.513 --> 28:23.181
And there they go.
Run, little piggies!

28:26.219 --> 28:27.352
You ready?
Ready.

28:38.264 --> 28:39.197
Unh!

28:39.265 --> 28:40.665
Walk in the park, right?

28:40.733 --> 28:42.534
Let's get the hell
out of here.

28:49.683 --> 28:51.017
I don't see any cops.

28:51.085 --> 28:53.887
Once we get out of Overtown,
we're as free as a bird.

28:53.954 --> 28:55.655
Maybe we should ditch your ride,
just in case.

28:55.723 --> 28:58.725
We have a better chance
getting caught car-hopping

28:58.792 --> 29:00.527
than we do motoring through.

29:04.465 --> 29:05.565
What are you worried about?

29:05.633 --> 29:06.966
In 15 minutes,
you'll be home,

29:07.034 --> 29:08.735
enjoying some alone time
with that file.

29:11.705 --> 29:12.906
Yeah. Hey.

29:12.973 --> 29:14.941
Michael, please tell me
you're on your way.

29:15.009 --> 29:16.576
Working on
a couple more kinks.

29:16.644 --> 29:18.711
Ah, well, that doesn't sound
very promising.

29:18.779 --> 29:20.580
I must tell you,
your extracurriculars

29:20.648 --> 29:22.448
are getting in the way
of my operation.

29:22.516 --> 29:24.050
I'm trying to.

29:24.118 --> 29:25.919
Remember what I told you in training
about the verb "to try"?

29:25.986 --> 29:28.154
How much time do I have?

29:28.222 --> 29:29.789
An hour, max.

29:29.857 --> 29:33.626
Michael, if you want us
to close up shop here,

29:33.694 --> 29:35.595
you just say the word

29:35.663 --> 29:37.697
because I just don't think
it's fair to Fiona

29:37.765 --> 29:38.831
to get her hopes up.

29:38.899 --> 29:40.567
No, don't pull the plug.
I'll --

29:40.634 --> 29:41.834
No more calls. Got it?

29:41.902 --> 29:43.136
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just my bookie.

29:43.204 --> 29:44.938
I'm in a big hole with him.

29:45.005 --> 29:47.373
One more job, and I get back to even --
Worry about this job first.

29:47.441 --> 29:48.942
What are you worried about?

29:49.009 --> 29:51.377
We're miles away from the cops.
My buddy took care of us.

29:54.848 --> 29:56.549
Damn it.

29:56.617 --> 29:58.685
If we don't lose them now,
it's gonna get ugly real fast.

29:58.752 --> 30:00.220
Try the first side street
after 23rd.

30:00.287 --> 30:01.521
Duck into
the housing projects.

30:01.589 --> 30:03.156
You sure it's not a dead end
this time?

30:03.224 --> 30:06.593
That wasn't my dead end.
It was <i>your</i> wrong turn.

30:06.660 --> 30:09.729
Whoa!

30:09.797 --> 30:11.064
Sam!

30:13.100 --> 30:15.201
Yelling isn't helping.
Then get us out of here.

30:15.269 --> 30:16.836
Hey, you want to drive?
Come on over.

30:16.904 --> 30:19.105
They get much closer, I'm gonna
have to start shooting.

30:19.173 --> 30:22.275
All right. I got an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

30:24.845 --> 30:26.980
Hey, Sam.

30:27.047 --> 30:29.949
Hey, Jesse, uh, please tell me
you're still at the loft.

30:30.017 --> 30:31.251
I was just leaving. What's up?
Oh, great.

30:31.318 --> 30:34.120
Listen, uh,
I got a bit of a cop problem.

30:34.188 --> 30:36.122
You know the speedboat
that's docked down by the river?

30:36.190 --> 30:37.657
Yeah.

30:37.725 --> 30:39.692
Yeah, I need you
to get that

30:39.760 --> 30:41.928
and meet me under the Port bridge,
you know, like now.

30:41.996 --> 30:43.830
You got it, Sam.

30:45.599 --> 30:47.834
Did you say,
"under the bridge"?

30:47.901 --> 30:49.569
Yeah, hope you can swim.

30:58.864 --> 30:59.934
<i>More often than not,</i>

30:59.935 --> 31:02.970
<i>high-speed chases end with</i>
<i>the fleeing driver in handcuffs</i>

31:03.038 --> 31:04.983
<i>or in a bed at the hospital.</i>

31:05.051 --> 31:06.352
<i>Escaping with your freedom</i>

31:06.419 --> 31:08.721
<i>and the ability</i>
<i>to use both of your legs</i>

31:08.788 --> 31:12.669
<i>means making a getaway the cops</i>
<i>aren't prepared to deal with.</i>

31:12.941 --> 31:14.709
Okay, running out of
real estate. You ready?

31:14.776 --> 31:16.711
We die,
it's on you, Evel Knievel.

31:16.778 --> 31:18.946
Well, we make it,
mojitos are on you, sweetie.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.751
Okay!

31:55.784 --> 31:57.685
Did I come through with this,
bro, or did I come through?

31:57.753 --> 31:59.420
You're right.

31:59.488 --> 32:01.022
It says the cops had
a different informant.

32:01.089 --> 32:02.123
It's not Trent.

32:02.190 --> 32:03.791
I told you.
Hey, I got to go.

32:03.859 --> 32:05.226
You got a lot of things
to work out,

32:05.294 --> 32:06.460
a lot of things to figure out.

32:06.528 --> 32:07.728
Oh, there's
nothing to figure out

32:07.796 --> 32:09.030
'cause
there's only one person

32:09.097 --> 32:10.731
that could have given the cops
this much info.

32:10.799 --> 32:13.734
But there's no way --
can't be right.

32:13.802 --> 32:15.703
If it's in the file, I don't
know how you argue with that.

32:15.771 --> 32:17.004
You don't understand.

32:17.072 --> 32:20.074
Everything in this file --
it points to my wife.

32:20.142 --> 32:23.010
<i>When your target draws a</i>
<i>conclusion you're not ready for,</i>

32:23.078 --> 32:25.880
<i>you play along if it helps you</i>
<i>get the job done.</i>

32:25.948 --> 32:28.916
<i>Sometimes, it makes wrapping up</i>
<i>a mission quick and easy.</i>

32:28.984 --> 32:30.985
No, I don't buy it.

32:31.053 --> 32:33.921
<i>And other times, it makes</i>
<i>your job that much harder.</i>

32:33.989 --> 32:37.191
Damn, this must be
difficult for you.

32:37.259 --> 32:41.429
But I think you got to
start facing the facts.

32:41.496 --> 32:45.199
Donna has been with me forever.
She's my whole life.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.335
Why would she do this?

32:47.402 --> 32:49.036
Well,
with your old man gone,

32:49.104 --> 32:51.272
maybe she wanted
to move up the food chain.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.975
Hey, you have to admit,
the shoe fits pretty damn good.

32:54.042 --> 32:56.110
Now I know why she gave me
such an icy reception.

32:56.178 --> 32:57.345
This isn't possible.

32:57.412 --> 32:59.046
There has to be
some kind of explanation.

32:59.114 --> 33:00.915
You're starting
to make excuses for her?

33:00.983 --> 33:03.551
You sound like my mom when she
got in a fight with my old man.

33:03.619 --> 33:06.687
"Oh, he didn't mean it.
He <i>loves</i> us."

33:06.755 --> 33:10.758
You gonna forget that your dad
died in prison because of her?

33:10.826 --> 33:13.094
You have to
remember that, bro.

33:13.161 --> 33:14.962
I have been
saving this bullet

33:15.030 --> 33:16.897
for the person
who sent my dad away --

33:16.965 --> 33:18.399
hollow-point, 9-millimeter.

33:18.467 --> 33:19.867
You want me to use this
on my wife?

33:19.935 --> 33:20.968
No, you're
smarter than that.

33:21.036 --> 33:22.169
You kill her,
you go to jail.

33:22.237 --> 33:25.406
Don't kill her.
Just...kick her ass out.

33:25.474 --> 33:26.907
Don't look back.

33:26.975 --> 33:29.176
I can't.
You have to.

33:29.244 --> 33:31.512
You have to think about
all the wasted hours you spent

33:31.580 --> 33:33.614
chasing the wrong guy!

33:33.682 --> 33:36.917
You have to think about
the pain she caused you.

33:36.985 --> 33:38.986
You have to do this for you.

33:39.054 --> 33:40.254
You have to do this
for your dad.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.156
You have to finish
what you started, bro.

33:42.224 --> 33:43.290
I'm gonna talk to her.

33:48.130 --> 33:49.530
I'm gonna sort this out.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.634
Ah, the outdoor speakers
are busted again.

33:53.702 --> 33:54.969
I got to get --
Don't take another step.

33:55.037 --> 33:57.104
We got to talk right now.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.608
Wes, quit screwing around. What's --
I'm serious.

34:00.676 --> 34:02.109
What the hell's going on?

34:02.177 --> 34:03.878
Explain something
to me, Donna.

34:03.945 --> 34:05.279
Why do I have a file

34:05.347 --> 34:07.014
that says you've been
feeding info to the cops?

34:07.082 --> 34:09.617
Why does it say that Trent
was a damn goose chase?

34:09.685 --> 34:10.885
Explain that to me!

34:10.952 --> 34:13.454
What? Hold on.

34:13.522 --> 34:16.590
Honey, where are you
getting all of this?

34:16.658 --> 34:18.324
From
your new friend there?

34:18.393 --> 34:20.594
What's it matter?
Okay, this is crazy.

34:20.661 --> 34:21.929
Think about it.

34:21.996 --> 34:24.398
Ever crossed your mind
that this guy is playing you?

34:24.466 --> 34:26.199
He could be working for Trent
for all you know.

34:26.268 --> 34:27.768
Look at you,
always spinning a story,

34:27.835 --> 34:29.335
trying to wiggle your way
out of this.

34:29.404 --> 34:30.804
Okay, who the hell
do you think you are?

34:32.340 --> 34:36.944
Wes, how long
have we been together?

34:37.012 --> 34:38.713
I love you.

34:38.780 --> 34:41.282
I would
never do this to you.

34:42.751 --> 34:44.452
What, that son of a bitch
comes in, and --

34:44.518 --> 34:45.686
and everything changes?

34:45.754 --> 34:47.955
He's not even family.
Family?

34:48.023 --> 34:49.757
You don't think
watching his dad's back

34:49.824 --> 34:51.826
in the joint
for three years makes me family?

34:51.893 --> 34:52.793
Breaking my parole?

34:54.563 --> 34:56.397
Baby...

34:56.465 --> 34:57.998
Look, Wes,
this is your move.

34:58.066 --> 35:00.000
You know what to do,
and if you don't...

35:00.068 --> 35:03.771
maybe you're not the man
your dad thought you were.

35:09.644 --> 35:10.644
Wes.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.784
Get her out of here.

35:16.852 --> 35:18.252
I never want to see her
here again.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.787
What?

35:19.855 --> 35:23.724
Baby, come on!
Baby, just -- Wesley!

35:23.792 --> 35:26.060
Come on! Baby!

35:36.438 --> 35:37.805
All this crap.

35:37.873 --> 35:40.407
Some detective
I turned out to be.

35:40.475 --> 35:41.742
You figured it out.

35:41.810 --> 35:43.410
You just needed
a co-detective.

35:47.783 --> 35:49.283
I got to jet.
Hey.

35:49.351 --> 35:52.820
Anything you need,
you just ask.

35:52.888 --> 35:54.221
I might
take you up on that.

36:00.395 --> 36:03.364
Here I, uh -- I thought
you forgot all about us.

36:03.431 --> 36:04.665
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.

36:04.733 --> 36:07.101
Where am I going
for this meet with Greyson?

36:07.169 --> 36:09.470
Grove Key Marina, and don't
bother stopping for a snack.

36:09.538 --> 36:11.305
You only have 30 minutes
to get the guns,

36:11.373 --> 36:12.773
and you still need
to get wired up.

36:12.841 --> 36:14.208
Tell Fi I'm on my way.

36:14.276 --> 36:16.043
News flash --

36:16.111 --> 36:18.846
turns out your boyfriend
<i>can</i> be everywhere at once.

36:18.914 --> 36:21.482
Sadly, that means
my evening is also spoken for.

36:21.550 --> 36:23.918
I can't wait to meet
this Greyson in person.

36:23.985 --> 36:25.052
You boys have fun.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.887
Oh, I'm sure
it'll be a blast.

36:26.955 --> 36:28.656
Listen, I, um --
I went ahead

36:28.723 --> 36:30.457
and took the liberty
of getting you some takeout --

36:30.525 --> 36:33.794
Thai, I think, or --
I-I can't remember,

36:33.862 --> 36:36.263
but whatever it is, I'm --
I'm sure it's a lot better

36:36.331 --> 36:37.832
than what you get
in this dump.

36:37.899 --> 36:40.901
You think a little lousy takeout
is gonna make me forgive you?

36:40.969 --> 36:45.272
Forgivee <i>me?</i>

36:45.340 --> 36:47.875
Forgive me for pulling every
single string at the Agency

36:47.943 --> 36:49.143
to get you out of here?

36:49.211 --> 36:50.911
Or is this
still about Ireland?

36:50.979 --> 36:53.781
Because if it is, let me straighten you
out on that score.

36:53.849 --> 36:57.518
Michael's cover
was about to be blown.

36:57.586 --> 36:59.720
He wouldn't leave <i>you.</i>

37:01.990 --> 37:03.524
Forget about the fact that,
if he stayed,

37:03.592 --> 37:06.227
you'd both
be dead right now, or worse.

37:06.294 --> 37:08.562
And would you, uh

37:11.366 --> 37:13.434
Would you like
to venture a guess --

37:13.501 --> 37:15.636
just exactly who
dropped everything

37:15.704 --> 37:17.605
and flew
halfway around the world

37:17.672 --> 37:19.573
to make sure that
that didn't happen?

37:23.211 --> 37:26.247
So, for all
the happy memories

37:26.314 --> 37:30.351
that you have made so far
with Michael Westen,

37:30.418 --> 37:34.788
the fun, the excitement,
the, uh -- the felonies...

37:34.856 --> 37:38.859
You...are...welcome.

37:50.949 --> 37:52.949
I rush across town to make this deal,

37:53.075 --> 37:55.259
and Greyson doesn't bother
to show up on time?

37:55.327 --> 37:56.727
Hey, you know what?

37:56.795 --> 37:58.195
It sure beats
waiting on pins and needles

37:58.263 --> 37:59.397
for you all day.

37:59.464 --> 38:01.465
What can I say?
I'm in high demand.

38:01.533 --> 38:03.667
How about you focus on the prize
there, maestro?

38:03.735 --> 38:05.803
Shot at the buzzer
only counts if you drain it.

38:05.871 --> 38:09.273
Uh-huh. And Greyson
is now headed your way.

38:09.341 --> 38:11.242
Remember, he has to take receipt
of the guns

38:11.309 --> 38:12.610
before we move on him, yes?

38:12.677 --> 38:15.112
You know, I was able to function
in the field

38:15.180 --> 38:16.414
for six years without you.

38:16.481 --> 38:17.948
No joke, Michael.

38:18.016 --> 38:20.384
Best years
of my life there, pal.

38:24.256 --> 38:25.756
Michael Westen.

38:25.824 --> 38:27.491
Almost didn't recognize you
without the suit.

38:27.559 --> 38:29.493
Laundry day.
Where's my five grand?

38:29.561 --> 38:31.395
Answer something
for me first.

38:31.463 --> 38:33.564
Oh, is this an interrogation
or a deal?

38:33.632 --> 38:34.799
<i>That's the thing.</i>

38:34.866 --> 38:36.200
<i>I haven't heard from Fiona</i>
<i>for months,</i>

38:36.268 --> 38:37.501
<i>and then, boom,</i>
<i>deal of the century?</i>

38:37.569 --> 38:40.171
You know when something seems
too good to be true.

38:40.238 --> 38:41.839
Come on, now, Michael.

38:41.907 --> 38:43.407
Fi's counting on you.
Bring it home.

38:43.475 --> 38:44.675
Oh, you think
this is a setup?

38:44.743 --> 38:45.943
Crossed my mind.

38:46.011 --> 38:47.778
If I was working
with the cops,

38:47.846 --> 38:49.680
they would have
already stormed in here

38:49.748 --> 38:51.182
the moment
you pulled a gun on me.

38:52.884 --> 38:54.351
I don't hear any sirens.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.020
Fair point.

38:56.087 --> 38:58.923
Still, I'm curious
why Fi's in such a hurry

38:58.990 --> 39:00.491
to offload these guns.

39:00.559 --> 39:01.826
She's trying to buy me off.

39:01.893 --> 39:03.060
What are you talking about?

39:05.630 --> 39:09.467
She skipped town. She headed
back to Ireland with this Brit.

39:09.534 --> 39:11.135
Screwed me on a deal.

39:11.203 --> 39:13.804
What can I say?
At least she pays her debts.

39:13.872 --> 39:17.107
Well, at least she gets <i>you</i>
<i>to pay her debts.</i>

39:17.175 --> 39:18.776
Well, look at that.

39:18.844 --> 39:21.645
Michael Westen
with a broken heart.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.716
It kills me.
It really does.

39:25.784 --> 39:27.117
I'll be crying into my pillow
tonight.

39:28.753 --> 39:31.388
This should cheer you up
a little.

39:35.694 --> 39:37.761
Guns
are in the Charger.

39:37.829 --> 39:39.029
Load 'em up.

39:39.097 --> 39:41.565
That's our cue. Drop the hammer.
Go! Go! Go!

39:48.974 --> 39:49.907
You son of a -- ugh!

39:52.177 --> 39:55.179
You think Fi would replace me
with a Brit?

39:55.247 --> 39:56.847
Aah!

39:59.718 --> 40:01.585
You're dead, Westen.
You hear me?!

40:01.653 --> 40:04.455
Dead, dead, dead, dead.
Yeah, I know.

40:06.591 --> 40:08.259
What do you say, Card?

40:08.326 --> 40:09.460
Greyson is in cuffs.

40:09.528 --> 40:11.061
Is that enough
to make the Agency happy?

40:11.129 --> 40:14.765
Michael, take a breath,
for the love of God.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.201
You are allowed to be human
every once in a while.

40:17.269 --> 40:19.336
Answer the question, please.

40:19.404 --> 40:21.872
Well, Michael,
as of 20 seconds ago,

40:21.940 --> 40:24.742
Fiona got invited
to the CIA company picnic.

40:24.809 --> 40:26.410
She is an official asset.

40:26.478 --> 40:28.412
Now it is up to you

40:28.480 --> 40:31.382
to apprehend her
"Get out of jail free" card.

40:31.449 --> 40:32.516
Go get 'em, tiger.

40:32.584 --> 40:33.517
I'm working on it.

40:43.395 --> 40:45.863
Hey, Mikey.

40:45.931 --> 40:47.464
I think
you've earned a couple beers

40:47.532 --> 40:48.632
for working
double-duty today.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.767
Thanks. I'm not drinking.

40:49.834 --> 40:51.201
Well, neither is she.

40:51.269 --> 40:53.270
I thought we were all
supposed to be friends now.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.495
Doesn't matter.
I guess I can toast by myself.

40:57.964 --> 40:59.237
Your brother is safe.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.840
Are you sure?

41:00.907 --> 41:02.641
You don't think Wes is still
gonna come after him?

41:02.709 --> 41:04.076
Wes found
someone else to blame.

41:04.144 --> 41:05.311
It's over.

41:05.378 --> 41:07.880
Thank you.

41:07.948 --> 41:10.983
Um, I don't really know
what else to say

41:11.051 --> 41:14.787
other than...thank you.

41:14.855 --> 41:17.923
Like I said,
I always keep my promises.

41:24.331 --> 41:25.764
Well, I suppose
you want me

41:25.832 --> 41:27.733
to hold up my end
of the agreement now.

41:27.801 --> 41:30.436
I've been supplying Anson
with travel documents and cash

41:30.503 --> 41:31.704
every couple of weeks.

41:31.771 --> 41:33.472
I can tell you
the exact location

41:33.540 --> 41:35.107
of the hotel
in Atlantic City

41:35.175 --> 41:37.042
where he's
expecting his next drop.

41:37.110 --> 41:39.778
But there's something
I want from you first.

41:39.846 --> 41:41.347
Just promise me,

41:41.414 --> 41:43.148
when you finally get
that bastard in custody,

41:43.216 --> 41:46.952
no deals, no negotiations,
no compromises.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.688
Anson will get
what he deserves.

41:49.756 --> 41:51.390
I promise you that.
