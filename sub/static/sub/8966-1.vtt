02:43.960 --> 02:47.726
<i>Ah, the holidays.
The most wonderful time of the year.</i>

02:49.960 --> 02:51.883
<i>And so, begins my tale.</i>

02:54.240 --> 02:56.004
<i>On the snowy morning
of Christmas Eve,</i>

02:56.080 --> 02:59.402
<i>as Charlotte Cooper
set out her 37th snow globe,</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:02.802
<i>trying to create
the perfect Christmas for her family,</i>

03:02.880 --> 03:06.885
<i>she remembered a moment,
she'd hoped she could hold on to forever.</i>

03:11.120 --> 03:15.728
<i>Meanwhile, her husband, Sam Cooper,
who I can read pretty well,</i>

03:15.840 --> 03:19.322
<i>was recalling the moment
just after that moment...</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:22.449
<i>trying to remember
if he knew he was happy,</i>

03:22.520 --> 03:24.841
<i>at the same time,
the happiness was going on.</i>

03:28.520 --> 03:30.284
<i>And their beloved dog, Rags,</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:33.409
<i>remembered how good it felt to be
a Christmas present.</i>

03:43.160 --> 03:45.162
<i>And all over town,</i>

03:45.240 --> 03:48.722
<i>the Cooper clan, and then some,
were starting their morning too.</i>

03:48.800 --> 03:50.882
<i>Who are all these people?</i>

03:51.000 --> 03:52.331
<i>Well, that's the story.</i>

03:52.400 --> 03:54.482
<i>I can't just give it away.</i>

03:54.560 --> 03:56.244
<i>But for now,
they're heading into their holiday,</i>

03:56.320 --> 03:58.721
<i>searching for comfort
and a little more joy.</i>

03:58.840 --> 04:00.205
That's fine.
That's fine.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.645
All right.
Make gingerbread houses.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.364
Can you just have them at
my front door at 9:00 am?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.761
Yeah, but it's Christmas morning.
What if they want to sleep in?

04:05.840 --> 04:07.126
What kid sleeps in
on Christmas morning?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.247
I don't know.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.810
Why do you have
to change things?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.405
God forbid, I wanna spend
another 15 minutes with my kids.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.124
Why do you have
to be such a dick?

04:17.480 --> 04:19.050
Merry Christmas.
Season's greetings.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.406
Merry Christmas.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.240
We hope to
see you tonight, Angie.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.289
Hey, Charlie,
Merry Christmas. Shh!

04:27.680 --> 04:29.205
Don't take that personally.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.408
Take it as a group,
he hates everybody.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.323
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Grandpa.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.641
Merry Christmas, Bo.
Bo! Merry Christmas.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.485
Charlie, please don't
ditch your brother at the mall.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.211
Thank you for taking Madison today.
I really appreciate it.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.520
I can't be late for work.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.931
But it's Christmas eve, Hank.
Come on.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.126
Yeah, I know.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.690
Job's a job, right?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.040
Um...

04:49.120 --> 04:50.690
Madison's been doing
this weird thing.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.967
And I made the mistake
of laughing at it the first time.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.565
So, now she does it
all the time.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.484
Do me a favor.
When she does it, don't laugh.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.211
And then, hopefully,
she'll just stop doing it on her own.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.810
Sure. Of course.
What is it?

05:01.880 --> 05:03.882
- Hi!
- Hi, Madison.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.803
There she is.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.405
Grandma and Grandpa are here,
they're going to take you for the day.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.641
Can you say, "Hi"?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.881
You're such a dick.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.124
Dad, don't.
Stop it.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.204
Okay, let's go.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.602
<i>As Ruby served
her 19th Holiday Special,</i>

05:22.680 --> 05:26.127
<i>she remembered serving
Christmas dinner to her brothers.</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:29.283
<i>While her mother,
six eggnogs to the wind,</i>

05:29.360 --> 05:32.842
<i>was passed out on the couch.</i>

05:32.920 --> 05:36.720
<i>Although her childhood had
left her feeling separate from the world,</i>

05:36.800 --> 05:40.725
<i>Ruby felt an unexpected
connection to Bucky Newport.</i>

05:40.800 --> 05:42.643
<i>For the last five years,</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:44.927
<i>she looked forward to
starting her mornings with him.</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:48.368
<i>She loved how he wore
a suit and bow tie, every day,</i>

05:48.440 --> 05:50.568
<i>just like did
when he was a teacher.</i>

05:50.640 --> 05:53.723
<i>Always straightening it
and only making it worse.</i>

05:58.480 --> 06:01.006
Good morning.
I'm furious with you.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.046
What'd I do?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.360
That ending shattered me.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.885
Well, it's supposed to.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.530
That's what makes it one of
the most significant endings

06:07.600 --> 06:08.840
in the history of film.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.285
But Chaplin's face...

06:11.360 --> 06:13.010
<i>Full of hope and fear</i>

06:13.080 --> 06:15.811
<i>and shame and embarrassment
and God knows what else.</i>

06:15.880 --> 06:19.680
But the genius was that it's his
subconscious autobiography.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.649
He had fallen in love
with several

06:21.720 --> 06:24.769
young women over the years
and he was their mentor.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.569
But he was endlessly
terrified that

06:26.640 --> 06:28.324
they're going see him
as he saw himself.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.927
Which is nothing but a busker,
in the streets of London.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.240
It's amazing.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.404
<i>Bucky looked away
from Ruby because,</i>

06:36.480 --> 06:40.007
<i>oddly, he felt closer to her
than anyone in his life.</i>

06:40.080 --> 06:42.606
<i>He understood the absurdity
of the situation.</i>

06:42.680 --> 06:45.843
<i>He had shown her 67 movies.
Ate at her diner, daily.</i>

06:45.920 --> 06:47.843
<i>And hated the food there.</i>

06:47.920 --> 06:48.967
You want the special?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.121
Uh...

06:50.200 --> 06:51.929
What day is today?
Friday.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.367
Friday?
It's not so special.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.766
How about Wednesday's?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.649
Or Thursday's hash browns?

06:58.720 --> 07:00.051
- Sold.
- Hey, Ruby.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.645
The Coffee's cold.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.846
You'll be fine.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.487
Sit down.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.484
Spending Christmas
with the family?

07:08.560 --> 07:10.801
<i>Ruby recalled the joys
of gift giving.</i>

07:12.960 --> 07:14.007
Nope.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.090
Believe me, I understand.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.322
Christmas comes around,
somebody yells,

07:19.400 --> 07:22.165
"Time for comfort and joy,
it's Christmas."

07:22.240 --> 07:25.210
Everybody panics as if
you can schedule happiness.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.406
Can't do it.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.845
You going to your daughter's?

07:27.920 --> 07:30.730
Oh, yes.
She's a very good cook.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.290
I don't know where
she got it from, because

07:32.360 --> 07:35.170
when their mother died,
the only thing I could teach her was

07:35.240 --> 07:37.004
how to order out.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.811
I don't know what it is.
Everything is a contest with my girls.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.848
Except I have no idea
what the prize is.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.720
I try to ease the tension,
but they don't really hear me.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.404
Hey, Ruby,
my coffee's still cold.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.200
Why don't you come over
here and warm me up?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.484
Sorry, I got to go.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.164
Clearly, an emergency.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.961
I just don't feel like
spending any money on her.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.088
She never spends a dime on me.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.928
My own sister. Oh!

08:11.000 --> 08:14.129
You know what she'll do.
She'll make a donation in my name.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.043
Oh, that's really festive.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.249
And they never say
how big a donation,

08:19.320 --> 08:23.962
so there's no way of knowing
how much I'm supposed to spend.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.409
I am tempted to get
the rattiest thing I can find,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.767
just to see
my sister Charlotte's face.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.967
Hold on.
I'll call you back.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.927
<i>When Emma was a little girl,</i>

08:47.000 --> 08:49.924
<i>she overheard her parents say
that her sister, Charlotte, was planned,</i>

08:50.000 --> 08:51.684
<i>but that she was an accident.</i>

08:53.920 --> 08:56.810
<i>She faithfully behaved
like one, ever since.</i>

08:56.880 --> 08:59.770
Ma'am, ma'am,
we need to detain you.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.241
Give it to me.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.607
Come on. Let's just make
life easier on everybody.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.527
Spit it out.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.521
Spit it out.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.691
Give it to me.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.606
Merry Christmas.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.682
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Best ever.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.886
Thank you.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.809
Our last number

09:25.880 --> 09:28.724
is one of my aunt's favorites.
So, this is for you.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.801
Aunt Fishy.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.484
Rags! Get down, Rags.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.807
Okay, then.
Ready, Mrs. Pinkins?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.166
Hit it.

09:38.240 --> 09:43.121
<i>♪ Joy to the world
The Lord has come</i>

09:43.200 --> 09:44.201
<i>♪ Let earth... ♪</i>

09:44.280 --> 09:46.601
That's not the right lyric.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.763
I'm sorry, Mitzi,
but I think it is.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.524
From the top, please.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.570
I'm not going to play to the wrong lyric.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.880
Don't play it, Mitzi.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.045
Mitzi's right.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.565
It's not the right lyric.
Of course it's the lyric.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.290
Joy to the world,
the Lord has come.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.409
No, it's not the Lord has come,
like God reached orgasm. Please...

10:05.640 --> 10:06.880
What?

10:09.480 --> 10:10.481
Mitzi!

10:11.840 --> 10:14.081
Well, so, Merry Christmas,
everyone.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.162
I think that ends
our little program.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.481
Thank you so much.
You've been a wonderful audience.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.925
We will be back next year.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.411
But will they?

10:23.440 --> 10:26.125
Yeah, you don't have to worry about
that after tonight, that's for sure.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.770
You don't have to say it
like you're never

10:27.840 --> 10:30.207
going to see me again,
Charlotte. I'm not dying.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.725
No. But we are.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.766
Hey, Tinkerbell.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.723
<i>Aware of the growing distance
between her parents,</i>

10:44.800 --> 10:48.486
<i>Eleanor Cooper found herself
drawn to public displays of affection.</i>

10:51.520 --> 10:55.161
<i>She remembered a time in her life
she had not been so guarded.</i>

11:00.480 --> 11:02.005
This is quite fun.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.163
If you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.801
Okay?

11:17.080 --> 11:18.650
Oh.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.362
<i>She remembered a moment
she'd wished she could forget,</i>

11:25.440 --> 11:28.046
<i>the day a stolen kiss
caught her eye.</i>

11:28.120 --> 11:30.521
<i>She recognized that kiss.</i>

11:30.600 --> 11:32.728
<i>It was her fiancé's.</i>

11:32.800 --> 11:36.009
<i>Eleanor was shattered.</i>

11:36.080 --> 11:41.120
<i>Alas, she could never climb
the wall that built up around her heart.</i>

11:41.200 --> 11:44.841
<i>Still, Eleanor secretly
searched out strangers' faces</i>

11:44.920 --> 11:47.685
<i>for the moment they flickered
with unguarded emotion.</i>

11:56.240 --> 11:58.527
Can I have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice, please?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.806
I'd be honored
to buy you a drink.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.120
I can pay for my own drink,
thank you.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.321
Not you.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.245
Thanks.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.000
I'll have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.284
Put the presents
for the kids in the trunk.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.886
And I'll get
your tip next time.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.405
No problem.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.562
And take the Internet,
it's faster.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.130
You got it, Aunt Fishy.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.487
My nephew
called me that.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.528
He and wife
are going to Africa

12:25.640 --> 12:27.529
and I'm babysitting the kids.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.881
I'm your nephew.
Can you remember my name?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.130
Um...

12:34.000 --> 12:35.126
Sam.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.885
Yes. I'm Sam,
that's great.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.088
I know your name.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.288
I'm not a zombie.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.805
You better step on it.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.803
You're going to
miss your plane.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.928
Aunt Fishy,
that was 30 years ago.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.570
Really?

12:49.640 --> 12:51.290
Well, how was the trip?

12:51.360 --> 12:53.044
We didn't go.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.521
Well, you were dying to go.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.208
And you and Charlotte,
saved your money for years.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.250
We had a rough year,
so we postponed it.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.802
Oh, Sammy.
And then you never went.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.087
Weren't you supposed to go,
again this year?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.844
Yes, we were.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.968
<i>Who can say
what ends a marriage?</i>

13:16.040 --> 13:19.203
<i>Perhaps it's unreasonable
to ask human beings to grow at exactly</i>

13:19.280 --> 13:23.365
<i>the same rate for 40 years,
six months and three days.</i>

13:23.440 --> 13:26.205
<i>But the canceled trip
was the last straw.</i>

13:26.280 --> 13:29.409
<i>And Sam was moving out.</i>

13:29.480 --> 13:33.246
You seem out of sorts.
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.645
<i>As Hank Cooper waited
for his 17th job interview</i>

13:38.720 --> 13:40.245
<i>in the past month,</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:42.288
<i>he wondered how long
he could keep up</i>

13:42.360 --> 13:45.523
<i>the lie that he was
still taking family portraits at Sears.</i>

13:45.600 --> 13:47.284
Big smiles, guys.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.850
You're going to have
this picture for the rest of your lives.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.161
It's going on a wall.
All right, right here. Ready?

13:53.640 --> 13:55.608
Oh! Yes.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.047
<i>He missed his job helping
unhappy families appear happy.</i>

13:58.120 --> 14:00.441
Love the sweaters,
right? Chipper.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.447
Yes. And that's beautiful.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.806
<i>It was his superpower.</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:09.323
<i>Unexpectedly,</i>

14:09.400 --> 14:13.803
<i>he thought of a woman
he saw just once and never again.</i>

14:13.880 --> 14:16.770
<i>Then he thought of the automated
voice that had replaced him.</i>

14:16.840 --> 14:21.767
<i>Merry Christmas.
Toes on the line. Cheese.</i>

14:21.880 --> 14:24.167
<i>Did that voice have children?</i>

14:24.240 --> 14:27.722
<i>Did they now have unaffordable
gifts on their Christmas lists, too?</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:31.725
Dear Santa, please
bring me a blue bicycle.

14:31.800 --> 14:36.727
I'll be waking up at my father's,
but opening presents at my mom's.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.088
<i>Hank thought of the unbridled
joy he had Christmas mornings.</i>

14:42.040 --> 14:43.485
Mister Cooper?

14:48.960 --> 14:53.170
<i>Determined, Hank entered
the office with his left foot.</i>

14:53.240 --> 14:55.288
<i>He'd read this was lucky.</i>

14:55.360 --> 14:57.328
I want to thank you for taking
the time to speak with me today.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.129
I really appreciate it.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.531
I know that you're not actually
hiring anyone till the new year,

15:00.600 --> 15:01.840
but just know that...

15:02.680 --> 15:04.250
I'm ready to work now.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.802
You know, I could start today
if you needed it.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.245
I take pride in my work.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.209
I take a lot of pride
in my work. I...

15:11.280 --> 15:14.807
At my last job, if a family took a bad picture,
I insisted on taking another,

15:14.880 --> 15:17.645
because I care.
I care. I just...

15:17.720 --> 15:20.200
I hated the idea
of anyone sending out

15:20.280 --> 15:21.850
a bad holiday card.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.969
You know, you don't get another
shot at that for a whole year.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.008
You know how many relatives
are going to see that?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.764
Who's going to care
about that now, Bob?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.080
Who's going to care about that?

15:31.440 --> 15:35.206
Dude, you are way too
intense for Staples.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.600
So what your deal?
What do you do?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.210
I am a writer.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.089
Oh! Wow. All right.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.288
What do you write?

15:54.360 --> 15:56.488
<i>Are you familiar with the Pottery Barn Catalog,
Outdoor Furniture Edition?</i>

15:57.200 --> 15:58.326
All-weather wicker.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.050
You know my work?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.521
I write plays, actually.
I don't know why... Yeah.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.523
Wow. That's cool.
Yeah.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.204
My last play was
almost produced.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.164
And then...

16:12.520 --> 16:15.285
...my lead actor
slash ventriloquist

16:16.160 --> 16:17.571
left for a paying job.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.210
He was a Republican,
naturally.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.285
Republican ventriloquist.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.450
Oh, no. No.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.602
You're way too cute
to be a Republican.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.250
Ah.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.210
Well, the good news is
I'm not a ventriloquist.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.408
Just tell me you're not one
of those churchy Republicans,

16:36.480 --> 16:40.280
who believes in Fox News,
but not evolution.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.762
Okay. If man evolved
from monkeys and apes,

16:43.840 --> 16:46.571
why are there still,
monkeys and apes?

16:46.640 --> 16:49.530
It's funny because my dog asked me
the same thing about wolves yesterday.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.443
All right.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.760
Look, you believe
in God, right?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.086
Which one?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.168
Any one, just pick one.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.527
They all need too much
validation for me.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.082
It's all, "Love me most
or go to hell."

17:02.160 --> 17:05.050
I have a hard time believing
I'm less needy than God.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.327
Yeah, I have a hard time
believing you are too.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.240
So you don't believe
in much, do you?

17:10.319 --> 17:12.482
You know
what I believe in?

17:12.560 --> 17:17.167
I believe in the sound
of Nina Simone's voice.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.686
I feel like that is the closest
I'll ever come to believing in God.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.568
I haven't heard her.
Wow.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.765
Sorry.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.251
It'll make you a convert.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.329
What are you doing
in an airport bar anyway?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.006
Shouldn't you be with your people
in denying science,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.923
or wherever
you're from?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.083
I'm just trying to get home,
but everything's snowed in.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.480
Isn't that what
you're doing here?

17:44.520 --> 17:47.842
No, I flew in
to see my family.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.689
I have to be there
at 5:00.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.127
I'm just here to kill
an hour or six.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.001
All right.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.883
Hey. Whoops.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.486
I hope Eleanor's
plane wasn't delayed.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.090
And something's up with Hank.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.889
He always does that
weird piglet snort

18:04.960 --> 18:06.689
whenever he's trying
to hide something.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.125
People snort, Charlotte.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.965
No. This is not a universal snort,
like.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.611
It's not.
It's a kind of a... It's...

18:13.680 --> 18:15.808
It's specific like.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.326
It's...

18:18.400 --> 18:21.165
Merry Christmas.
Anyway. All right.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.605
Well...
Oh, my goodness, look.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.330
Oh, I've got a surprise
for you, Madison.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.643
This is genuine,
guess what. Look.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.010
Gingerbread house.
Yes.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.283
Maybe I should bake
a peppermint cake.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.362
- Why?
- Because it's Christmas, Sam.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.522
For God's sake,
it's Christmas.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.040
You can't cook this away,
Charlotte.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.809
People are going to look back
on tonight and realize

18:43.880 --> 18:45.803
it was all a performance.
We should have, at least,

18:45.880 --> 18:47.564
warned them
before they came.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.530
No, but I want them to wanna come,
that's the whole point.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.568
This is the only time of the
year when we're all together.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.324
And it's our last chance

18:54.400 --> 18:56.289
to feel like a family
before we tell them.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.725
I want the kids

18:57.800 --> 19:00.485
to have the memory
of one last perfect Christmas.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.608
And I know that you think
that I'm ridiculous...

19:02.680 --> 19:04.409
No, I don't think
you're being ridiculous.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.721
Under the circumstances, yeah,
you are being a little ridiculous.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.644
<i>♪ ...Comfort and joy
Comfort and joy</i>

19:09.720 --> 19:14.248
<i>♪ Oh, tidings
Of comfort and joy ♪</i>

19:14.320 --> 19:16.641
We clearly have a major
difference of opinion

19:16.720 --> 19:18.688
and I can understand
why you are wrong.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.484
If you treat them
like they're not resilient,

19:20.560 --> 19:21.971
they're going to be
not resilient.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.929
Hank is still reeling
from the divorce...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.002
and you know...
I'm sorry, okay, go ahead.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.081
No, you go ahead.
I'll listen.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.810
Well...
I feel like a fraud.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.882
The whole thing feels wrong.
I'm going to tell them the truth.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.200
We'll all be together.
Wait a minute.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.611
No, we made an agreement.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.489
You cannot break an agreement,
mid-agreement.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.449
I disagree.
No, you agreed to the agreement.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.170
You agreed to one
last Christmas

19:39.280 --> 19:40.691
and then you can
just move out.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.205
You want to leave,
you can just go ahead and leave.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.647
Hold on, you're the one
who chose not to go.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.680
You don't care enough about
the marriage to make...

19:46.720 --> 19:49.849
<i>Will the parents of the
lost child in aisle seven</i>

19:49.920 --> 19:52.730
<i>Please come up
to the front and claim her?</i>

19:52.800 --> 19:54.165
<i>You're such a dick.</i>

19:54.240 --> 19:56.322
Oh, my God.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.207
<i>Bo was on a mission.</i>

20:00.280 --> 20:03.409
<i>He had to find the perfect
gift that would bring back his brother,</i>

20:03.480 --> 20:06.051
<i>who had become an alien
since his parents' divorce.</i>

20:17.480 --> 20:19.721
<i>That gift had to have
healing powers</i>

20:19.800 --> 20:21.882
<i>and it had to be cheap.</i>

20:28.000 --> 20:30.526
<i>He even sacrificed
his one-on-one with Santa.</i>

20:32.320 --> 20:34.209
<i>Nothing about this mission
was easy.</i>

20:34.280 --> 20:36.442
<i>But Bo would not be thwarted.</i>

20:37.600 --> 20:39.364
This is a whole
misunderstanding.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.244
Look, I'm somebody's mother.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.765
I have three kids.
They're teenagers.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.966
They're teenagers.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.646
Already, they don't
take me seriously.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.722
My husband's
an ethics professor.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.643
He'll never forgive me.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.371
My entire family is coming over at 5:00
for Christmas dinner,

20:54.480 --> 20:55.766
which I have to cook.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.889
Please. Don't you have
any compassion?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.564
So, it's all a misunderstanding?

21:00.640 --> 21:03.610
Yes.
Okay. So, clear it up.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.040
How'd the jewels
get in your mouth?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.691
Right. This way.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.921
I though it was a lozenge.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.927
<i>Shortly after his mother
moved out,</i>

21:14.040 --> 21:16.725
<i>Charlie felt as unclaimed
as a lost Christmas package,</i>

21:16.800 --> 21:18.882
<i>lying in the back corner
of the post office.</i>

21:20.000 --> 21:21.889
<i>In spite of this,</i>

21:21.960 --> 21:24.611
<i>he arrived at the mall,
vowing he would kiss Lauren Hesselberg,</i>

21:24.720 --> 21:26.961
<i>once and for all,
or die trying.</i>

21:55.720 --> 21:57.848
<i>Unnerved, he began
to watch himself.</i>

22:00.160 --> 22:02.401
<i>He told himself to coolly say,</i>

22:02.480 --> 22:05.165
<i>"What's up, Lauren?
What's up?"</i>

22:06.120 --> 22:07.360
Hey, Lauren.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.681
Hey, Charlie.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.041
What you doing here?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.531
I, I work here.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.483
Of course.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.929
<i>When, at last, he stood
in front of her,</i>

22:24.000 --> 22:26.571
<i>a clear directive repeated
itself in his mind,</i>

22:27.760 --> 22:29.285
<i>"Don't look at her boobs.</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:32.927
<i>"Do not look at her boobs."</i>

22:46.800 --> 22:49.929
I love the way Stewart does a little
food dance when his meal arrives.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.401
And how Sarah still puts
lipstick on for Hal.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.845
I like the way Paula Anderson
rests her breasts on the table,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.285
as if they were tired.

23:03.920 --> 23:08.926
We were so sad to see you go,
Ruby. I'm gonna miss you.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.566
Take care, okay?

23:13.640 --> 23:15.244
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, guys.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.924
You're going somewhere?

23:22.280 --> 23:23.406
It's my last day.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.282
What?
Yeah.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.250
You tell the lady with the lipstick on
her teeth and you don't tell me?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.561
I don't...
I didn't know how to tell you.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.081
It's like that movie you gave
me, <i>Born Yesterday,</i> right,

23:37.160 --> 23:39.731
when Billie Dawn walks
out on Harry Brock.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.007
There's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.365
You told me,
right here, you said,

23:46.440 --> 23:50.126
"Starting over, you could
be the hero of your own life."

23:50.240 --> 23:51.685
You can be a hero, here.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.491
Where are you going?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.130
Hot Coffee, Mississippi.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.168
I found it on a map
when I was 14 years old.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.005
It seems like the perfect place
for a waitress.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.048
Look, I don't understand.
I'm confused.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.886
You've never even been there.
It's the worst idea I've ever heard of.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.169
But I... I want to start over.
I need...

24:10.920 --> 24:12.331
I need a change.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.767
No, no, no, no.
Leaving doesn't change anything.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.490
Everything just
comes with you.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.045
Hot Coffee, Mississippi?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.202
That's a place?
It's like a line from a sitcom.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.725
Bucky.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.802
You're a bird watcher.
You watch us all from a distance.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.723
We're just characters
that amuse you.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.406
Not true.
You love everybody at arm's length,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.323
keep it up and you'll
end up alone, Ruby.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.129
That's a terrible thing
to say to me.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.605
Well, it's a terrible
thing to watch.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.091
It's very cowardly.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.646
So, in other words,
you think that I'm a coward.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.122
No. Not in other words,
those are the words.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.680
You think you can run away,
hiding in Hot Chocolate?

24:43.760 --> 24:45.444
You're a coward.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.646
You can pay up front.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.960
You tell everybody at the restaurant
you're leaving and you don't tell me.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.486
May I ask you something?

25:43.640 --> 25:46.211
Is this something that they teach
you at the Police Academy?

25:46.280 --> 25:48.044
Or have you always
been a robot?

25:49.240 --> 25:51.368
I can understand

25:51.440 --> 25:53.488
that you need
professional distance

25:53.560 --> 25:55.130
from a hardened criminal.

25:55.240 --> 25:59.723
But when there's a poor,
downtrodden housewife,

25:59.800 --> 26:02.451
sobbing in the back
of your car on Christmas,

26:02.520 --> 26:04.124
one has to wonder.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.283
I'm guessing it's something
they teach you.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.689
No one's born that way.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.087
<i>Though Officer Williams never
engaged with suspects</i>

26:15.160 --> 26:16.366
<i>in the back of his car,</i>

26:16.440 --> 26:18.522
<i>Emma unknowingly
pierced his armor.</i>

26:19.760 --> 26:21.250
I'm not a robot.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.201
What?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.328
I have feelings, just
like everyone else.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.965
Would you like
to talk about it?

26:31.040 --> 26:32.530
I'm not talking to you.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.489
Take me to your leader.
Shut up.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.081
Listen.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.921
You landed in a pot of jam,
arresting me.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.561
I've been a doctor
for 20 years.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.961
People pay me a lot
to listen to their problems.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.611
You're a head-shrinker?

26:55.680 --> 26:58.160
<i>What Emma did not know
was that Officer Williams</i>

26:58.240 --> 27:00.129
had once sought out counseling,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.965
<i>but couldn't get over the fact
that he would have to talk.</i>

27:09.960 --> 27:14.761
And we're off, with Rudolph,
right here, to see Santa.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.604
And Donner, and Vixen...

27:16.680 --> 27:18.682
And Blitzen and Nixon...

27:21.600 --> 27:23.170
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.691
Silent Night <i>reminded
Charlotte of a part of herself</i>

27:36.800 --> 27:40.122
<i>that now felt inescapably
out of her grasp.</i>

27:40.200 --> 27:43.841
<i>She caroled to deflect
the fact that she missed that person...</i>

27:43.920 --> 27:45.604
<i>as much as Sam did.</i>

27:45.680 --> 27:50.481
<i>♪ All is bright</i>

27:50.560 --> 27:54.849
<i>♪ Brown young virgin</i>

27:54.920 --> 27:57.605
<i>♪ Mother and child... ♪</i>

27:57.680 --> 27:59.170
What?

27:59.280 --> 28:01.089
Really? You think it's a song about
a brown young virgin?

28:01.200 --> 28:02.361
And her mother
and her child.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.601
Oh, my God.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.409
I didn't write the song,
Charlotte.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.084
Look, Sam,
I was a music teacher.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.004
Round. That's what it is.
She's a round young virgin.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.969
Yeah, it's much better.
Very Christmassy.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.165
Oh! Oh. Yes.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.401
Don't worry. We're going.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.403
Off we go.
Next stop, where?

28:17.480 --> 28:22.088
To see the one,
the only, Santa.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.641
And Santa's
army of helpers.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.324
- Right.
- It's Santa's brothers.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.085
Anta, Janta, Mylanta...

28:56.520 --> 28:59.683
Oh, man,
look at that. They...

28:59.800 --> 29:04.362
I love moments where people are
so unchecked, so unselfconscious.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.361
I know. It's ridiculous.
I like watching people.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.283
I just love that moment when

29:12.360 --> 29:14.203
a face floods with feeling.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.928
Oh, I get it. I do.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.165
All right.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.442
Hit the pool?
Mm-hmm.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.363
Yeah. Oh, God.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.920
Where'd you go? Bailey?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.606
Bailey?
Oh, God, thank God.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.603
I thought you were gone.
That is very effective camo.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.284
All right.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.800
Did you always want to
join the army?

29:36.760 --> 29:39.161
Uh, it's a long story.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.844
Oh.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.206
Father in the military?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.805
Mm-hmm.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.769
Short story, really.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.121
It was the right
thing to do.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.690
Hey, I admire it.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.969
I can't imagine putting my life
on the line for anything.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.485
What if I was wrong?

29:55.560 --> 29:58.131
That certainty,
that's amazing.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.248
Thank you.
In like a...

30:00.360 --> 30:03.523
corporate-loving, government-trusting,
gung-ho kind of way.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.726
Uh-huh.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.770
As opposed
to your mistrusting,

30:07.840 --> 30:10.810
sideline-hugging,
passive sort of way.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.882
Right.
Yeah.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.804
How does your family
feel about you leaving?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.087
They're happy I'm finally
getting my life together.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.525
Oh.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.365
Yeah. They haven't seen me
since I looked like...

30:24.320 --> 30:25.367
This.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.450
Oh, wow!

30:28.520 --> 30:30.761
That's an extreme
transformation!

30:30.840 --> 30:32.330
That's incredible.
Can I keep this?

30:32.400 --> 30:34.084
I'm going to need
to keep this. Wow!

30:40.880 --> 30:43.121
How long
have you felt robotic?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.804
I don't.

30:44.880 --> 30:48.089
I see, so you believe
you're in touch with your feelings then?

30:48.200 --> 30:50.089
Yes.
Both of them?

30:55.440 --> 30:56.726
Apparently...

30:57.880 --> 31:00.360
I...

31:00.440 --> 31:03.125
have trouble expressing myself
in relationships.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.731
How old are you?

31:05.840 --> 31:06.921
I just turned 40.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.968
And, uh,
how's your sex life?

31:13.360 --> 31:14.600
How's your sex life?

31:14.680 --> 31:18.082
I have sex
with people, okay? But...

31:18.160 --> 31:20.640
But you don't connect
emotionally?

31:20.720 --> 31:22.131
And what's
your biggest fear?

31:23.680 --> 31:25.364
I don't want to end up alone.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.160
And gay.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.201
What?

31:32.480 --> 31:34.801
You're 40,
you're single.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.291
"People" sleep with you?

31:36.360 --> 31:37.646
Are you serious?

31:38.400 --> 31:39.845
Are you gay?
No!

31:49.120 --> 31:50.360
Only in bed.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.046
You all right, Grandpa?

32:15.160 --> 32:17.481
Yes, yes, exceptional.
Never better.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.881
How did it go?

32:20.840 --> 32:22.729
Exceptional.
Never better.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.566
That bad?

32:24.640 --> 32:26.688
Yeah, what the hell
am I going to do?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.888
I got to find a job
by the new year.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.928
You don't have to find a job
by the new year,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.331
that's an arbitrary deadline.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.243
You can find it January 11th,

32:34.320 --> 32:37.085
March 17th,
it makes no difference.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.366
I'll lend you the money.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.680
I don't want to be
that guy.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.969
I like that guy,
he's a very fine guy.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.486
Now then, what shall
we get Charlotte?

32:46.560 --> 32:49.131
Poinsettias or poinsettias?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.361
How about poinsettias?

32:51.040 --> 32:53.202
Good idea.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.805
I got it,
I'll take care of it.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.041
That's all right.
No, no, I got it.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.650
I got it.
I got it!

32:57.720 --> 32:59.529
Let me...
I got the god damned flowers!

33:00.480 --> 33:01.686
You get the flowers.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.285
$8.99.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.488
I'll get that
back for you.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.722
Hank, you don't have to hide
this from your family.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.971
They're your family.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.042
I don't want to
ruin Christmas for Mom.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.329
Well, then tell Angie.
She will understand if the alimony is late.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.802
No, I was a failure at marriage.
I refuse to be a failure at divorce.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.009
You're not a failure.
Some marriages have a shelf life, that's all.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.923
But you and Angie
were never happy.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.680
Angie was always looking over her
shoulder for what she didn't have.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.247
FOMO.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.804
FOMO?
Fear of missing out.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.370
We fought about it
all the time.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.568
Look, I understand.
There's history there,

33:36.640 --> 33:38.210
you were high school
sweethearts.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.169
No, that...

33:40.240 --> 33:42.049
That's not true.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.849
We were not sweethearts.
That is family fiction.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.207
We were lab partners.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.009
We dissected rats together.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.521
Then, out of nowhere...

33:51.600 --> 33:55.605
band practice at Travis Howard's house,
Angie pounced on me...

33:55.720 --> 33:57.529
while
<i>My Sharona was playing.</i>

33:57.600 --> 34:00.604
I got as far as "My, my, my, my,"
and then, boom! Done.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.286
I became a dad,
same day I failed Biology.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.125
Listen, don't let this one moment
define your entire life.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.964
I'm telling you this
from the heart now.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.804
Angie talks while she chews
with her mouth wide open!

34:10.880 --> 34:12.210
It's like a fireman's hose.

34:12.320 --> 34:13.924
It speaks of her character.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.967
She's worse than my Aunt Edna.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.248
Look, Hank,
I had kids young, just like you did.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.926
I had to raise them
while I was still raising myself.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.005
Trust me, this is one small chapter
in your great, big life.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.411
Go out and get some!

34:31.960 --> 34:33.643
Just get some?
Get some.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.089
It's... The thing is...

34:39.159 --> 34:40.241
Yes?

34:43.080 --> 34:44.491
You've only been with Angie?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.728
Yes, that is the thing.
Mm-hmm.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.083
This is solvable.
This is a solvable problem.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.406
Doesn't it suck how we can
want to run from our families,

34:59.480 --> 35:00.970
but impress them
at the same time?

35:02.280 --> 35:04.760
I just disappoint mine.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.649
I think the build up to
facing their disappointment

35:06.720 --> 35:08.131
is actually the worst part.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.362
"Anticappointment,"
I call it.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.602
I can't face the
anticappointment.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.400
Is that why
you're avoiding them?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.731
I just hate the holidays.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.768
I hate having to reduce
everything I'm doing

35:20.840 --> 35:22.569
down to a sound byte
and then defend it.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.482
And I just...

35:25.600 --> 35:28.649
I hate reverting back to how
everyone saw me.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.961
Maybe you should join the army.
Yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.081
Are you scared?

35:36.720 --> 35:37.720
No.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.520
Here.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.809
Take that.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.450
How about a little
Nina Simone?

36:54.240 --> 36:57.289
<i>Even though he knew he would
never see her again,</i>

36:57.400 --> 37:00.927
<i>Joe would always remember
this amazing moment,</i>

37:01.000 --> 37:03.048
that only happened in his mind.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.125
You know what, Madison?

37:12.200 --> 37:14.521
Guess what, you can really see
the North Pole from up here.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.204
Did you know that?

37:16.280 --> 37:20.729
This is your daddy's favorite
place in the whole wide world!

37:25.120 --> 37:26.406
Three for the red lane, please.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.084
You know, or maybe
what we could do is

37:28.160 --> 37:30.322
we could join Aunt Fishy for
a nice cup of hot cocoa.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.641
What a wonderful view.
This was so much fun. Let's go.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.688
Oh, come on.
We're not shooting her out of a cannon.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.841
You used to love those.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.729
Where is your sense
of adventure?

37:37.800 --> 37:39.564
Buried in a good book?
No!

37:39.640 --> 37:42.086
I am not, you are...
That's just ridiculous!

37:42.160 --> 37:44.561
Come on, Madison. Let's just go.
We're gonna show him.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.529
Nice and easy does it,
right, sweetheart?

38:11.640 --> 38:15.531
Every time I go home, I'm told it's so
okay that I am not in a relationship.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.602
It's so okay.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.841
So, how come you're not?

38:19.960 --> 38:21.485
How come you're not?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.766
Who says I'm not?

38:23.840 --> 38:25.444
Oh.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.569
Ooh.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.688
I'm not.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.200
Yeah, I just wanted to see
your reaction if you thought I was.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.166
Okay, Are you?

38:39.120 --> 38:41.009
I don't know.
Sort of.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.800
He couldn't get away
for the holidays.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.121
Prison?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.366
He's with his wife.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.491
Oh.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.601
Yeah.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.080
Yeah, that's not the kind of
thing you'd want

38:58.120 --> 38:59.645
to share with mom and dad, huh?

38:59.720 --> 39:01.051
No, I don't like to brag.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.609
Wait, look.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.250
I don't believe
in marriage,

39:08.880 --> 39:10.564
okay? Love fades.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.529
Yeah, so?

39:12.600 --> 39:15.331
Every time a face floods,
that's over a new relationship.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.121
Right?
No.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.521
Don't do that.
Don't throw me up to me.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.409
Do you even know any
happily married people?

39:21.480 --> 39:22.481
Yeah, my parents.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.690
I mean, you know what
I'm worried about,

39:25.800 --> 39:27.450
is that I'm never going to find
what they have.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.170
I'm worried that I will.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.686
The second we left the house,
my parents' marriage imploded.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.285
They fight all the time now.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.646
So do mine.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.846
You just said they were happy.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.251
Passionate.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.209
Ugly.
Honest.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.281
Heartbreaking.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.247
So, who was he?
What?

39:46.360 --> 39:48.966
This guy that messed with your head.
I mean it's got to be somebody right?

39:49.040 --> 39:51.520
Otherwise, you wouldn't settle
for a married guy.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.046
You think he's going to leave
his wife for you?

39:54.160 --> 39:57.209
Nope. That was never
on the table.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.248
And, besides,
we live in different states.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.725
That's good.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.201
Wouldn't want to go
wasting your life, right?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.248
You want to know
what's a waste of a life?

40:06.320 --> 40:08.607
A know-it-all with
a freshly shaved mullet,

40:08.680 --> 40:12.048
who slaps on a uniform and thinks
it gives him the moral high ground.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.691
When, really, he's just risking
his life to please his dad.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.446
Best of luck.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.640
Does your mother know?

40:39.200 --> 40:40.645
She knew before I did.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.087
How do you know?

40:46.640 --> 40:49.644
Listen, if it's hard
to talk about,

40:49.720 --> 40:52.087
maybe a little role-play
can free you up.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.401
I could play your mom
and you be you.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.686
Hi, sweetie!

41:00.160 --> 41:01.525
Hi, Mom.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.522
Stop. You're not
doing you right.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.761
What?

41:06.840 --> 41:08.444
You're not a robot yet.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.249
You're still a little kid.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.205
I'll be you, you be Mom.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.363
Hi, Mom.
It was career day at school.

41:17.440 --> 41:21.081
And Odell said that he wanted
to be a podiatrist like his dad.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.323
And I said, I wanted to be...

41:24.400 --> 41:27.882
Percy, don't gesture so much
when you talk.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.962
Well, Kenisha said that
she wanted to...

41:30.040 --> 41:32.008
Percy, stop tilting your head.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.401
Percy, stand with
your legs apart.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.050
Percy, don't smile so big.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.329
I said that I wanted to be...

41:47.960 --> 41:49.200
An explorer.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.290
And now you wear a "Do not
enter" sign across your chest.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.570
You couldn't be a gay man,
so you became a stereotype of a man.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.369
Oh, it's so sad.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.289
The things we do
in our childhood,

42:06.360 --> 42:08.966
just to fit in,
make us stand apart as adults.

42:10.920 --> 42:14.811
Cold, hard truth is, when I was asked
what I wanted to be when I grew up,

42:14.880 --> 42:17.326
I never said, "alone."

42:17.400 --> 42:19.050
You feel alone
with three teenagers?

42:19.120 --> 42:22.488
Oh, them. No. I lied.
I don't have any kids.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.126
I don't even have a husband.
What?

42:25.200 --> 42:27.851
Yeah. I knew you'd think,
"She's alone,

42:27.920 --> 42:30.730
"she's not getting any younger.
Of course she'd swallow a brooch."

42:30.800 --> 42:33.041
I opened up to you
and you lied to me.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.771
No, I lied
before you opened up.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.330
I would never lie to you now.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.721
The conversation part
of this arrest is over.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.766
What?

42:59.840 --> 43:01.649
What?

43:01.720 --> 43:03.529
That scream you made,
coming down the hill.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.441
Is that the Whitehead kid?

43:09.520 --> 43:11.170
The one we used
to call Schnozzle?

43:14.320 --> 43:16.482
Quick, quick,
what was his name?

43:16.560 --> 43:18.483
Skippy.
Don't say. "Skippy"

43:20.400 --> 43:21.890
Oh, here. Oh.

43:21.960 --> 43:25.169
Hey. Think you can
drop me at the mall?

43:25.240 --> 43:26.446
Get in.
All right.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.644
Thanks.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.609
Seriously,
what's his name? I can't remember.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.806
Schnozington.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.925
Oh.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.240
Get in the back, Rags.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.767
Does your mom know
you're out hitchhiking?

43:40.840 --> 43:43.923
No, she took my keys away
when she caught me with pot in the car.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.086
Well...

43:46.760 --> 43:48.046
What?

43:48.120 --> 43:49.531
It's not like we never
got stoned, Charlotte.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.840
We grew up in the '60s.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.968
You grew up in the '60s?

43:53.040 --> 43:54.280
Cool!

43:54.400 --> 43:55.925
Hear that, Charlotte?
What?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.923
Schnozzle Whitehead
thinks we're cool.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.001
Wait. What did you call me?

44:04.600 --> 44:07.080
Yeah we used to...
It was groovy.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.730
We knocked around.
We went to concerts.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.245
Charlotte met Bob Dylan.

44:10.320 --> 44:12.243
Are you serious?
What was he like?

44:12.320 --> 44:14.049
No, I only met him
for a couple of seconds.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.566
Till security dragged you
off of him.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.642
Were you guys hippies?
Yeah!

44:18.720 --> 44:20.245
No.
What do you mean, "No"?

44:20.320 --> 44:22.243
Oh, my God!

44:22.320 --> 44:24.800
She used to speak
at rallies,

44:24.880 --> 44:27.121
in front of anybody.
You should have heard her.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.170
No, it's just that I liked
how loud my voice sounded

44:30.240 --> 44:31.765
over the microphone.
It's nothing at all.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.561
Oh, no. You were fearless,
man, you had passion.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.722
I don't remember much
of that at all.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.364
You don't remember that day?

44:41.880 --> 44:42.961
No.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.721
<i>Really?</i>

44:51.000 --> 44:52.843
That was a long time ago,
when...

44:55.720 --> 44:57.051
That was our...

44:58.920 --> 45:00.445
first time, huh?

45:03.520 --> 45:05.363
Your idea to go up
in the woods.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.083
That was not.
I followed you, I did.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.929
Oh, no, I followed you.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.684
<i>I couldn't take
my eyes off you.</i>

45:13.760 --> 45:15.320
<i>Yeah, neither could your dog.</i>

45:16.320 --> 45:17.651
Who could blame him?

45:18.960 --> 45:20.803
You can just let me out here.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.849
If you want.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.604
Right here is good,
actually.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.081
Look, I crossed the line.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.321
I'm sorry.
All right.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.845
I came on
a little strong.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.207
No, I shouldn't have said that.
That was below the belt.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.760
I wouldn't let it go.
It's on me. All right?

46:32.840 --> 46:34.444
It's true.
It is your fault.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.766
You're a total hussy.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.801
Look, sometimes
things happen...

46:42.880 --> 46:44.450
when you're not even
looking for it.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.169
He tell you that?
Yeah.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.009
Great.

46:49.080 --> 46:51.606
Hey, I would love to have fallen
for someone as presentable as you.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.284
Okay? Trust me.

46:53.360 --> 46:57.001
No. You just want to fall for me
because you know I'm leaving.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.969
Do you always speak
in country lyrics?

47:04.400 --> 47:06.528
Well, it's been, um...

47:06.600 --> 47:08.204
Exhausting.
Yeah.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.130
Have a good...

47:13.200 --> 47:15.123
Yeah, you too.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.282
I'll think good thoughts
for you in the new year.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.364
Oh, wow! You sound exactly
like my mom.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.960
Cool.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.122
I have four sisters, so...

47:25.200 --> 47:26.486
I can sound
like anyone's mom.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.085
Oh, well,
mine would love you.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.327
Anyway, bye.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.881
Yup.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.842
Come with me.
What?

47:49.920 --> 47:52.685
Look, I know you don't know me,
you're not even sure if you like me, but...

47:52.760 --> 47:54.171
be my boyfriend.
Uh...

47:54.240 --> 47:56.720
Listen, I can't deal with that
look on their faces again.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.041
Okay? Just be my boyfriend
for one night.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.884
Oh, no way.
What are you going to do?

48:00.960 --> 48:02.564
There's no flights
until morning.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.927
Look at this, you're just going to spend
Christmas by yourself,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.764
eating dinner
at Wetzel's Pretzels?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.729
All right. Okay, stop! That's crazy.
You're being deployed.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.691
You deserve a crazy,
pull out all the stops, home-cooked meal

48:12.760 --> 48:15.127
and I can guarantee you that.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.521
You would make
my parents so happy.

48:17.600 --> 48:21.844
I mean, really, isn't it
the Christian thing to do?

48:21.960 --> 48:24.361
Okay, well, fine, but...

48:25.480 --> 48:28.131
It involves
a tiny white lie, yes.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.409
But a lie
that provides comfort.

48:31.480 --> 48:34.927
And it's really perfect
because you are going to war.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.650
And, you know,
that's a win-win.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.881
I'm just...

48:39.520 --> 48:40.520
Sorry.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.881
Wow.

48:46.080 --> 48:49.084
That is, kind of,
a beautiful moment.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.442
Look, hey...

48:55.520 --> 48:57.204
All we would
have to figure out

48:57.280 --> 48:59.009
is how long
we've been together.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.769
And what your name is.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.563
I just got you...

49:07.640 --> 49:10.484
It's Christmas, so,
I got you a mistletoe!

49:12.440 --> 49:14.204
It's lame, whatever,
I'm stupid.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.202
<i>Never having
French-kissed before,</i>

49:19.280 --> 49:21.169
<i>Charlie felt Lauren's tongue
in his mouth</i>

49:21.240 --> 49:24.483
<i>and he thought she was having
an epileptic seizure.</i>

49:24.560 --> 49:26.688
<i>When he realized she wasn't,</i>

49:26.760 --> 49:29.411
<i>his heart began to soar.</i>

49:31.960 --> 49:35.601
<i>Francis, the mall cop,
contemplated breaking up the young couple,</i>

49:35.680 --> 49:40.083
<i>not because they were kissing,
but because they were doing it so badly.</i>

49:40.160 --> 49:43.403
<i>But, before he could,
not knowing why,</i>

49:43.480 --> 49:48.042
<i>every kiss Francis had under
a mistletoe flashed before his eyes</i>

49:48.120 --> 49:49.406
<i>like a Christmas gift.</i>

50:01.800 --> 50:03.404
Ugh.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.522
Get out!
Get out of here!

50:05.600 --> 50:06.647
Sorry.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.731
Boo.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.129
What's your problem, Lauren?
You're not such a dog.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.400
What are you doing hanging
out with this pus-face here?

50:17.440 --> 50:19.727
- Shut up, Brady.
- Ooh.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.609
You're going to let your girlfriend
talk to me like that,

50:21.680 --> 50:24.729
Blisters?
Huh, pussy?

50:24.800 --> 50:26.370
Mommy ever teach you
about deodorant?

50:28.440 --> 50:30.761
He doesn't smell
that bad, okay?

50:30.880 --> 50:32.484
You smell a little bit,
but not that bad.

50:32.560 --> 50:33.800
I smell?

50:33.880 --> 50:36.042
I can smell you halfway
across the mall.

50:36.120 --> 50:38.122
You leave my brother alone!

50:38.200 --> 50:39.929
Oh, yeah? Make me.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.601
Yes!

50:48.480 --> 50:50.482
Run!

50:50.560 --> 50:53.325
<i>This was the story
Bo would tell his friends for years.</i>

50:53.400 --> 50:55.482
<i>Now, what really happened.</i>

51:05.840 --> 51:08.844
<i>His mission to rescue
his brother abruptly terminated,</i>

51:08.960 --> 51:10.928
<i>Bo sat empty handed,</i>

51:11.000 --> 51:14.402
<i>contemplating the cataclysmic
consequences of his failure.</i>

51:32.160 --> 51:35.084
Okay, we met where?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.208
Airport bar.
Too trashy.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.561
Okay, how about where I do
volunteer work?

51:39.640 --> 51:41.165
Okay, where do you volunteer?

51:41.240 --> 51:42.765
I don't.
But I've always wanted to.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.365
Now I don't have to.

51:44.440 --> 51:47.046
Yeah, I don't think
just talking about volunteering counts.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.201
Pretty sure it does.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.611
Okay, how come
you never mentioned me?

51:49.680 --> 51:51.728
You're a Republican.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.610
When I first saw him,
I thought...

51:54.680 --> 51:56.728
this is never going to work.

51:57.640 --> 51:59.529
But, he was brave.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.765
She was...

52:04.120 --> 52:05.360
plucky.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.401
He uses words like, "plucky."

52:09.520 --> 52:11.522
That laugh.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.409
First time I heard it,
I was floored.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.449
He was open in a way that
I never could be.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.887
I wasn't even put off
by his faith.

52:22.960 --> 52:25.406
I actually thought
it was kinda hot.

52:27.880 --> 52:29.803
The whole time she talked
about "evolution,"

52:32.640 --> 52:34.927
I wondered...

52:35.000 --> 52:37.651
what it would be like
to touch her neck.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.486
You have a great neck.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.286
Oh.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.884
I like the way he touches
his lower lip when he's feeling vulnerable.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.610
I don't do that.
Like this.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.081
I don't do that.
Yeah.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.731
I wondered what it would be
like to kiss that lip.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.768
Really?
No.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.968
But, that's what I'm going to say to
my mom and she's gonna eat it up.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.601
All right.

53:03.680 --> 53:04.761
So good.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.764
Before I saw her, I...

53:09.840 --> 53:11.683
didn't believe
in love at first sight.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.726
Thought it was bullshit.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.125
And then I saw this...

53:18.160 --> 53:21.482
reckless girl who had forgotten
how beautiful she was,

53:22.360 --> 53:23.600
and I thought,

53:25.880 --> 53:29.407
I thought if I could wake up
every day and look into that face,

53:29.480 --> 53:30.970
I could get through anything.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.888
And you...

53:34.960 --> 53:37.725
were standing
right next to her.

54:34.920 --> 54:37.000
I thought you were
having dinner with your daughters?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.240
You're going to ruin
your appetite.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.049
I'm trying to.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.849
Cranberries get
on my nerves.

54:45.560 --> 54:48.723
I didn't want our last
conversation

54:48.800 --> 54:51.451
to be remembered
as our last conversation.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.441
Order whatever you want.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.767
It's on the house.
It's my Christmas gift to you.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.203
When I was younger, I worked
in a restaurant for a while.

55:03.320 --> 55:07.450
And if an ugly person came in,
I would often give him a free dessert.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.241
And I thought of myself
as being really special for...

55:13.560 --> 55:15.289
treating the uglies well.

55:16.440 --> 55:18.204
It's not what I'm doing.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.486
I'm happy to hear it.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.566
I'll get you some pie.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.689
Ruby? Listen...

55:47.520 --> 55:48.806
You're not a coward.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.644
You're the opposite
of a coward.

55:50.720 --> 55:54.805
You're brave and you're beautiful
and generous and big hearted.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.167
Can we have a minute's
privacy here, please?

55:58.000 --> 55:59.126
Thank you.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.644
All that sadness.

56:03.720 --> 56:07.281
That feeling like you've landed
in the wrong life.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.203
Everybody feels that way, Ruby.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.089
It's all just going to become
an anecdote.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.527
You don't know
that yet, Ruby, but...

56:13.640 --> 56:15.085
you're grand...

56:15.160 --> 56:17.925
You're like a grand piano...

56:18.000 --> 56:20.731
around a bunch of little
toy pianos and uprights...

56:21.440 --> 56:23.124
Thank you. But...

56:23.200 --> 56:25.282
you're the grand piano.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.209
<i>And for a brief moment,</i>

56:27.320 --> 56:29.448
<i>time was their friend,</i>

56:29.520 --> 56:32.763
<i>as Ruby saw Bucky
the way he felt inside.</i>

56:35.160 --> 56:37.561
Do you know why
I came here every day?

56:37.640 --> 56:39.290
Twice a day, sometimes.

56:40.920 --> 56:41.967
So I could see you.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.201
Just to see you...

56:46.680 --> 56:47.841
So I could be around you.

56:49.680 --> 56:51.250
Now I have to say goodbye again.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.802
I have a fear
that I am an impostor.

57:05.040 --> 57:09.045
My first play got
a lot of attention.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.805
So, basically I peaked at 19.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.365
I also have a fear of silence.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.011
I know.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.411
Okay, yeah.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.081
I'm dyslexic,

57:35.600 --> 57:39.446
so, when I was growing up,
I thought I was just stupid.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.600
I had a sister.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.809
She was born with a weak heart.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.600
So...

58:00.280 --> 58:02.567
Sometimes I think I might
be unlovable.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.643
I hear myself trying so hard
to be funny.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.130
I think you're funny,
'cause you're sad.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.009
Percy? I confess.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.287
Okay, I did it.
I took the brooch.

58:53.800 --> 58:54.847
I did.

58:54.920 --> 58:56.001
I know.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.081
For my sister.

58:58.560 --> 59:02.167
I was just being
small and petty.

59:02.240 --> 59:05.403
I'm always measuring out how much
love and attention I'm getting

59:05.520 --> 59:09.525
and then giving back just
exactly what I think I got.

59:09.600 --> 59:12.604
Like I think
I'm gonna be gypped in some way.

59:14.520 --> 59:19.048
What makes a person behave like
that, can you tell me?

59:19.120 --> 59:20.281
A grown person.

59:21.600 --> 59:22.600
And the three kids?

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
It wasn't a lie.

59:26.840 --> 59:27.840
It was a wish.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.202
<i>As she heard herself
say it aloud,</i>

59:33.280 --> 59:36.841
Emma remembered the moment
<i>she began to feel unremarkable.</i>

59:45.160 --> 59:47.686
<i>It was the first time she felt
jealous of her sister,</i>

59:47.760 --> 59:50.047
<i>who she always loved
and looked up to,</i>

59:50.120 --> 59:51.724
<i>until she couldn't live up to.</i>

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.366
<i>Emma had told herself
it was just an accident,</i>

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.885
<i>and yet somehow today,</i>

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.644
<i>Emma knew it wasn't.</i>

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.048
So, my mom has one sister,

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.485
Emma, she's always late.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.890
Their dad is Bucky.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.361
And my dad's aunt will be there,
Aunt Fishy.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.011
Don't ask. Nobody knows
why we call her that.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.764
And your brother is Hank,

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.128
and his kids are Charlie,
Madison and Bo Joshua, Maddie and BJ.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.489
BJ.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.562
What kind of a parent is gonna
name their kid BJ?

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.520
They're gonna see
right through me.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.483
Oh, no, they're gonna love you.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.485
Just don't mention gun control,
women's rights, or religion.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.562
Why don't you just tell them
I don't speak English?

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.769
No, I just don't want them to think
I'm dating some narrow-minded birther.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.571
The whole point of you coming home
with me is so I disappoint them.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.529
Whoa.
No, don't take it personally.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.489
They are liberally judgmental.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.320
Look, we have a plan,
let's just stick to it.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.805
How come you begged me to
come home with you,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.609
if I'm such a narrow-minded
disappointment?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.085
No, you misunderstood me...

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.003
Maybe you misunderstood you.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.128
Of course, you're so open-minded,
how is that even possible?

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.486
Right?
Hey,

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.681
calm down,

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.728
man up,
and let's lie to my parents.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.201
Okay?

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.440
Damn, lying comes
easy to you.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.406
Oh!

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.681
Sorry.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.930
Charlotte, come with me.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.765
Sam...

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.605
If we just got away from everything,
all the distractions,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.251
the kids,
we might have a shot.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.163
I'm giving this
one last try here.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.641
If we can't find
ourselves here...

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.210
how're we going to find
ourselves

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.329
on some worn out dream
we had of a trip to Africa.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.324
It's so much more than a trip
and you know that.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.687
For 30 years
I've given us a pass,

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.683
because you promised,

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.730
once I retired, you would
do this for us.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.086
And moving out is for us?

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.491
No the trip is for us,

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.449
because we've become invisible
to each other.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.727
Now? You want to go now?

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.529
What, with everything that's
going on with the kids?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.409
They're not kids anymore!

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.050
That doesn't stop!

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.645
Don't turn your back on me,
Charlotte.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.531
I am going to make
the dump salad.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.363
<i>The problem was,
they both were right.</i>

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.489
<i>But the fight about the trip
wasn't about the trip.</i>

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.884
<i>It was about the thousand microscopic hurts
that accumulate over 40 years.</i>

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.200
You don't want
to get into this,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.322
well, we are
getting into this.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.482
Yes, you are
a wonderful mother.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.608
But what happened to us?

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.127
We used to slow dance in the living room
when the kids went to sleep.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.531
What happened to that couple?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.965
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.088
There ought to be a whole
separate language for you.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.561
Wait, where's the pepper? Did I put
the pepper in the mash potatoes here?

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.608
Oh.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.603
Dad called, he said
he's bringing a friend,

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.523
probably an old student,
I don't know.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.250
No, Rags!

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.607
Oh, my God! Rags!

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.727
Rags.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.881
Get down, Rags.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.570
Good boy.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.563
Go on.
Go on, go on, Rags.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.250
Why are you laughing?

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.760
I don't understand
how we're going to

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.804
have Christmas without
mashed potatoes.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.131
Charlotte, it's funny.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.001
My God.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.727
When did we become
Alfred and Dizzy Ludwig?

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.131
Who are you talking about?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.170
The dullest, most lifeless
couple my parents knew.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.881
I'm not apologizing
for 40 years of marriage.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.486
We raised a spectacular family.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.846
We made a beautiful home...

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.365
And now you're afraid
to leave it.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.010
Stop saying I'm afraid
like I'm afraid.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.804
You are terrified.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.320
You're terrified to be alone with
me without a kid between us.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.089
Look, Mom.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.401
You're terrified if you take
your eyes off those kids for one second,

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.164
something will happen
on your watch.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.651
I have known you

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.008
for most of my life and clearly
you have no idea who I am.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.080
You're right.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.841
We lost track of each other,
raising the kids.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.805
And then Lizzy died.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.566
<i>And we stepped back.</i>

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.691
And we kept stepping back,

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.161
until that was comfortable,
until that was us.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.286
Why do you just accept that?

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.764
Did you ever consider

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.604
that this trip
is not my dream?

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.806
It's an old dream.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.084
I was in my 20s.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.130
It has no meaning
for me anymore.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.247
Then do it for me.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.840
Where did you go?

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.607
You got so small.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.887
I'm in love with a girl
that doesn't even exist anymore.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.246
I exist.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.846
If you want to go on
a trip with a memory,

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.206
then be my guest. Go ahead.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.123
Well, I'm going.
That's fine, go.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.645
You just go.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.929
One day, for God's sakes,
that's all I asked for,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.525
was one day,

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.967
all you had to do was hang
in for another 12 hours

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.567
and then we'd be done, but, no,
you have to ruin this day for me too.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.041
Well, you know what,
you can just leave now!

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.161
Just leave...
Hi.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.166
Merry Christmas.
Happy...

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.083
Merry Christmas.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.527
Mom, Dad, this is Joe.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640
Hi.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.046
Well...

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.201
We're engaged.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.847
Oh, God.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.403
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about, engaged?

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.165
A boyfriend is one thing,
but engaged is a completely different story.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.446
I made a mistake.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.567
You think?

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.483
When I agreed to come here
with you,

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.324
this whole thing is
way too insane.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.289
Well, now it is.
I mean, engaged?

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.885
You probably don't believe
in global warming,

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.930
okay? I could never marry you.
I'm sorry, but, please.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.490
Why? 'Cause I'm not
already married?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.080
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.810
You know what?
I've wasted enough time.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.041
Merry Christmas.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.727
No, Joe, wait.
I'm sorry, Joe, one sec...

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.160
Okay?
Yeah.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.400
Hi, honey. Congratulations.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.200
Where's Joe?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.206
Oh.
Honey?

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.364
Mom, please, just don't
make that face.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.283
I swear to God, if I look up
and you're making that face

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.441
I'm gonna lose it.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.891
But I'm not making a face.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.724
Actually, Charlotte,
you are.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.450
Sam this is
my everyday face.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.170
You're going like this.
No, I'm...

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.601
I am not.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.081
Okay, I'll be a Sphinx, right?

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.321
See? Hi, honey.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.004
Oh, God, there it is!

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.326
What?

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.561
Now, Buttons, calm down.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.324
Calm down?
Really, Dad, calm down?

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.607
Nothing makes people less calm
than being told to calm down.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.603
And now
you're making that face.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.126
Dad, you're just
as bad as Mom.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.131
Honey. Honey-bunny.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.328
Oh, God, please,
stop mothering me.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.402
But I am your mother
and I feel for you.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.403
No, you feel sorry for me.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.041
And you make me feel that I'm a person
that people should feel sorry for.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.565
That-
But you know, hey,

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.880
it wouldn't be Christmas
without Eleanor

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.485
coming home
to disappoint everyone.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.085
You're not a disappointment.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.649
Right, okay.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.131
Well, let me just give you
your Christmas present early.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.761
Mom, Dad,

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.609
Joe is actually...

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.609
...a smoker.
He is a chain-smoker.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.010
That's right.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.729
Just can't seem to quit.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.529
- It's tough.
- Oh, well...

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.328
You know what,
this calls for a toast.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.767
Yeah.
Bubbly, bubbly.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.251
I'm an alcoholic.
Wow.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720
I'm just kidding.
Yeah.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.720
Quite a kidder.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.643
Yeah, just can't help it.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.131
Aw, try.
Hey.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.926
We're here.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.524
Oh, Mom?
Yeah, what?

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.170
Just don't mention anything
about the engagement, okay?

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.729
'Cause we haven't told
Joe's parents yet.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.000
That's fine, that's good.
Okay.

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:02.408
Charlie, what happened
to your face?

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.921
Oh, he...

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.401
Oh, my God.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:11.363
Everyone, um, this is Joe.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.523
And, yes... And Joe
and your Aunt Eleanor

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.045
are engaged.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.326
Charlotte!
What? Oh, my God.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.482
Mom.
It just slipped out, I don't know.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.085
I'm sorry, I don't know what...

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.764
Right hand, orange,

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.046
and left hand, blue.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.326
Okay, yes.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.323
I got a right on orange.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.243
I thought we just said it
ten seconds ago.

Anyway, Merry Christmas, huh?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.364
Kiss her, Grandpa.
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.690
Oh.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.169
Oh, Bo. Oh, dear.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.765
You're suppose to kiss me.
Oh, okay.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.921
What are we doing here?

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.280
Is this where
you left your car?

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.605
Yes?

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.011
Merry Christmas.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.965
Thanks for the ride.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.041
If I ask you a question,

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.286
would you answer
me honestly?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Try me.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.450
Are you really a psychiatrist?

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.761
Of course, I am, sort of.
I'm a life coach.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.489
But you said
you were a doctor.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.846
Well...

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.604
You heard of Dr. Seuss?

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.926
I'm Dr. Newport.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.326
Wow.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.481
Officer Williams?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.280
Can I give you a hug?

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440
No.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.081
All right, then.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.610
A word of advice?

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.887
Certainly. If I were you...

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.122
For you, not from you.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920
Of course.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.889
You should buy your sister the most
expensive gift you can find.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.771
Try and be be the person
you want to become.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.330
<i>Emma was filled
with a tiny distant memory</i>

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.607
<i>she wasn't
sure even happened,</i>

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.162
<i>when her world was still
open to the possibility of magic.</i>

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.410
Yeah.
Carrots.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.006
Everybody make sure
you try those potatoes.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.321
Single perfect form, you be...

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.560
Oh, Dad?

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.363
I've been thinking about
our family a lot today.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.568
And I have something
that I'd like to say.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.444
I want to tell you...

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.851
No! Please, no.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.441
...how happy I am

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.800
that we're all here together.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.128
Well, hear, hear.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.362
We don't spend much time
under the same roof,

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.050
but no matter what happens...

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.288
we are family.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.409
Oh, God, look at
Bo's shiny, little face.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.962
Well, I think
that what Grandpa is...

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.771
trying to say is...

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.769
that celebrations like this

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
they just kind of...

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.200
remind us of...

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.765
how...

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.126
Irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable...

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.889
So, just...

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.247
But you know what, that is
enough said on that front, right?

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.164
Let's just toast to
celebrations, everyone.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.571
Cheers!

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.965
Okay.
Cheers.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.451
I'm hungry.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.922
I know. I hate to say it,
but Emma's not here yet.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.126
I think we should wait.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.884
I think it's important
for us to wait

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.928
for just a few minutes.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.924
Maybe the storm has knocked
out some traffic signals.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.206
Yeah, but she's always late.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.441
Let's just dig in!
Yes.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.727
Go ahead. It's Christmas, right?
Yes.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.723
Aren't we going to say grace?

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.962
Well, just let me finish,
for one second, Joe.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.451
Dad, would you like
to say grace?

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.646
Not really.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.609
Well, maybe you'd like
to listen to Bo

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.728
say grace. Bo, would
you like to give thanks?

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.370
No, thanks.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.124
Okay.
You know what, I'll do it.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.251
Oh. All right.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.131
Oh.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.760
Dear Lord,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.002
or whoever is listening,

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:43.201
thank you for this beautiful meal
when there are so many who have so little.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.931
And although I'm not with
my own family tonight,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.050
I'm grateful to be sharing
Christmas with such a thoughtful,

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.571
loving family...

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.766
Oh, my God.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.921
Jesus Christ!

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.525
Holy...

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.409
It's Rags.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.801
Mother of God, what are you
feeding that animal?

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960
Oh, Rags.
Yikes.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.363
It's okay. At least,
dinner smells good.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.487
Right?
Fabulous.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.686
Let's dig in.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.005
What's the matter?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.081
The pepper?

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.241
Is that what it is?

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.402
It needs more potato.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.289
I can't believe
you're getting married, El.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.407
Congratulations.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.488
Yeah, congratulations.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.766
I just can't believe it.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.650
Mmm. Stop saying that.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.085
It's just...

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.606
Joe, do you really know
what you're getting into?

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.400
Yeah, I've never
been more certain.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.608
Actually, I got down
on one knee when I proposed.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.205
She had her doubts,
but I didn't.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.920
Yeah, I knew it
the minute I met her.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.485
Kiss her. Kiss her.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.169
Come on.
Kiss!

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.366
Go ahead.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.885
Give her a kiss.
Come on.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.764
That is a kiss.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.049
<i>When Emma entered the dining room,</i>

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.522
<i>she remembered to be the person
she wanted to become.</i>

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.489
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.801
You're finally here.
We've been missing you.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.723
<i>But when confronted by family,</i>

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.600
<i>she forgot.</i>

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.284
Good, you started without me.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.285
Don't get up.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.125
I'm so sorry.
Dad and Eleanor both brought guests.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.328
Oh, can I sit here
near you, Madison?

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.849
I'd like to sit next to the
prettiest girl at the table, is that okay?

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.561
You're such a...

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.681
Madison?

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.482
<i>As Aunt Fishy slept, she dreamt
of dancing at the Mocamba,</i>

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.608
<i>Christmas of '46,</i>

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.968
<i>knowing for certain
she could get any man in the place,</i>

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.362
<i>Never considering she would be
anything but young.</i>

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.724
<i>The night had become
so haunted by ghosts of Christmases past</i>

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.842
<i>that Rags began to stress-eat.</i>

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.807
I think it's time
to go around the table

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.282
and tell each other our
wish for the new year, right?

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.203
Oh, God.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.040
What?

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.851
What? I mean, everybody
loves this game and

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.046
we play it every year.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.804
Everybody hates this game.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.803
And no one has
the nerve to tell you.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.291
Emma.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.930
Does anyone enjoy this?

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.640
I'd just like to say,

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.768
it's so wonderful to see
my daughters together.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.485
I remember when Charlotte
wouldn't even

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.291
be in the Christmas play,
unless they let Emma in too.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.611
They would sneak down and eat
the cookies Effie made for Santa

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.280
and they thought
we didn't know about it,

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.886
but we did.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.767
Dad, you're so right.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640
You're my sister,

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.450
and I love you
Okay.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.001
Mash potatoes?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.288
Did you get the B-I-K-E-S
for the K-I-D-S?

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.126
No. I thought we could go with
something hand-made this year.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.362
Hank, we agreed on the bikes.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.442
Right, I just...
You know...

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.171
Hand-made gifts are
from the soul, right?

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.210
They can't ride a soul to
school, they wanted bikes.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280
Kids want bikes.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.964
Sam,

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.762
that was the best dinner
I ever had in my entire mouth.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.320
I'm so glad
to hear that, Aunt Fishy.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.845
How was the trip, dear?

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.686
Fantastic.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.651
<i>Rags knew he was eating
his emotions, but could not stop himself.</i>

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.003
Could you pass
the, uh, green beans?

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120
Yeah, sure.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.130
You know what,
here, let me get them for you.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.611
It's okay. I got it.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.966
It's all right, I'm holding it.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.771
I can get my own green beans,
it's fine.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.127
Can I, please, just get
my own green beans?

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.486
Yes, just trying
to be helpful.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.050
You know what
would have been helpful,

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.610
is if you would have done
what you said you're gonna do.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.728
Now I have two helmets
sitting under my tree.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.564
This is exactly why I left.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.971
- This is why you left?
- Yes.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.690
Seems like you had a whole
lot more reasons than that,

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.127
'cause you left so fast
there was a cartoon swoosh cloud

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.326
in the doorway.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.760
I should have left
a long time ago.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.491
Stop fighting!

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.608
Why can't you stop fighting?

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.762
Why wont you stop?

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.723
All right, everybody,
let's just stop it, okay?

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.081
Just shut up and eat.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.286
I mean, we all...

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.806
We love each other
and it's Christmas.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.247
It's the most wonderful time
of the year!

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.010
Storm took out
the power lines.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.010
Stop it. No.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.048
Madison, don't be
scared, all right?

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.930
Bucky! Bucky!

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.047
Dad!

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400
Dad?

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.924
We're setting up
a CAT scan immediately.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.162
I can only imagine
how shaken up you all must be.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.368
It's quite
the Christmas present.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.480
Thank you, Doctor.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.320
Hank...

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720
FOMO.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.246
You have to wait back here.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.321
Wait!

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.483
What the hell
are you doing with your life?

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.609
You're sleeping with that oily
doctor when you're engaged?

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.645
Dr. Morrissey?

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.840
That's... Mom, I really don't
know where you got that,

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.446
but you're having a rough night
so I'm going to let it slide.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.284
But, honestly, Mom,
that's ridiculous.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.408
You know something, you always
talk too loudly when you're lying.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.244
I do not. That's...
Uh-huh.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.321
That's not even...

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
Fine.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.483
I knew you wouldn't understand.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.688
In fact, I knew you would
react exactly like this.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.886
I see.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.486
And... Oh, perfect.
There's the face.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.925
Did I do something wrong?

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.601
Was I too preoccupied with Lucy?

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.889
Did I make you feel
like you don't deserve more?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.684
Please, stop,
this isn't about you.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.808
Stop treating me like I'm
something that's broken.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.888
Okay? You can't fix me.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.928
Just go fix yourself.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.411
This is who I am.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.209
You need to accept that I'm
never going to be the person

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.691
that you want me to be.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.888
You are the person
I want you to be,

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.200
except...
Except.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.726
Yeah, except, you

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.361
deserve more. I think you could
build a life with this Joe.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840
Oh, Mom.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.207
Joe is a prop.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.971
Joe is a stranger
I picked up in an airport bar.

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.889
He is something I invented,

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.611
so that I didn't have
to face your face.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.764
Eleanor.
Just...

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.571
This could happen
to anyone, Madison.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.770
There was a lot of yelling going
on, I'm surprised...

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.047
it doesn't happen
more often.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.724
In your defense,

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.565
it was probably

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.322
the dump salad.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.885
There's a reason
it's called that.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.727
I tried, Madison.
Damn it, I tried.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.404
What?
She doesn't love me anymore.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.247
Forty years.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880
Gone.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.561
Poof

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.761
Thank you, Tinkerbell.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.684
I don't even think I kissed
him hello tonight.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.287
You can kiss him tomorrow,
because he's gonna be all right. Really, Emma.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.080
Oh, that's right, Charlotte.
Everything's always balloons and Jello.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.771
Wow, I realize that

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.091
we haven't been close

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.601
but I guess I just
didn't really know how much...

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.449
you don't like me.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.488
It's not that I don't like you,

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.722
it's just that I love you more
when I'm not with you.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.048
It's like we're allergic
to each other.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.885
But, hey, we were
branded from birth.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.009
I'm the coward.
Dad always said you're the brave one.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.764
No, Dad didn't say
that at all.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.286
Dad said you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.886
No. I'm the smart one,
you're the brave one.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.041
No, please...

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.684
I'm the coward.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.649
No, I'm the coward.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.006
No, I am, that's what Dad said.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.445
For God's sake!
I'm the coward.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.124
No. Don't even
kid yourself.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.009
Dad said that you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.003
I am the coward!

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.208
You are the brave one
and you're the smart one.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.362
I'm the coward.
Ladies! Ladies! Shh.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.090
Yes, of course. Sorry.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.565
Tell me what
happened to us?

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.130
You got the happy gene.
I didn't.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.884
That's not true.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.200
Charlotte...

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.770
No.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.968
You could be happy
licking an envelope.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.681
But, hey, I'd be happy too,
if I had everything.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.728
Everything? You think
I've had everything?

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.600
If you ever just asked me once how I am,
you'd know that my life is just

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.966
as screwed up as your life.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.769
Charlotte, look at me.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.971
I am a fully grown woman.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.850
You sat me at the kids table!

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.891
You have no idea what that feels like,
and you never will, you have a family,

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.760
I am alone.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.921
Don't I count as family?

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.487
Don't my kids count
as family?

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.289
They're your family too,
god dammit!

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.964
- They are your family.
- Ladies!

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.280
Out!
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.765
<i>Despite his broken heart,</i>

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.081
<i>Sam asked Madison for a dance,</i>

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.482
<i>determined to erase the image

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.210
<i>the First Butler Hospital</i>

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.851
<i>from the memory of her
5th Christmas eve.</i>

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.922
Miss Newport,
I have some news.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.762
So, your father had
a small stroke.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.281
He's stabilized now
and he's gonna be fine.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.762
You can see him later,
but right now we'd like him to rest.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.126
You can see him
when he wakes up.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.440
But he's okay?

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.727
His vitals are fine,
he's just resting.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.961
I'll check back in
with you later.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.121
Good, great.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.201
Thank you.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.560
He's sleeping right now.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.690
Get outta town.
Your doctor is "married guy"?

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.640
No.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.409
Yeah, I met him
a couple of years ago

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.642
when I brought my grandpa
in for a check up.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.051
A little agey, isn't he?

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.126
Well, let him down easy.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.729
I mean,

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.520
even a married guy doesn't
deserve to get dumped on Christmas, right?

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.440
Seriously?

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.762
You are not this person.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.280
Kinda look like her, though,
don't I?

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.686
No.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.410
You don't even know me.
What?

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720
After today?

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.124
Wow.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.690
Lying really does
come easy to you.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.204
Okay, how about this
for the truth?

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.169
I've known you
for eight hours,

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.009
and you are leaving in five.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.289
I'm sorry about your Grandpa, hon,
but he's gonna be okay. I promise.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:17.520
Be careful over there, okay?

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600
Yeah, you too.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.523
Lucky me.
I get to see you at Christmas.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.808
Wanna see what I got you?
Yeah.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.883
<i>♪ The first Noel
the angels did say</i>

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.362
<i>♪ Was to certain
poor shepherds... ♪</i>

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.445
Sorry, sorry.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.607
Sorry, no.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.611
Sorry.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.926
Sorry.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.128
Sorry!

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440
Excuse me.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.929
Wait. No. Hold the elevator!

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.960
That was a good one.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.051
You would've loved
to have seen you.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.167
You didn't leave.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:44.250
I couldn't.
We're too good a story.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.204
You picked me up in a bar.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.685
You came on to me.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.330
You stalked me
in an airport.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.243
You begged me
to go home with you.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.651
I couldn't get rid of you.

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.044
Yeah, we finally agree
on something.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.887
We're together just to say
goodbye, you know.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400
I know.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.449
You're like Clarence,

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.808
sent down to save
my wonderful life.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.171
Merry Christmas.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.607
Merry...

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.805
...Christmas.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
Hey, Charlie.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.046
Lauren?

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.246
I got your text.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.242
My...

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.969
Oh, yeah, no, of course.
Right, my text.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.203
I text girls all the time.
That's what I do, you know.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.045
I didn't think
you were gonna come.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.326
It's Christmas Eve.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.890
Oh, no. It's no big deal.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.964
We're Jewish, so, we were
just getting Chinese food, so...

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.724
Take your coat off and everything,
these are my parents right there.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.162
Well...
Maybe we should...

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.764
give them a little privacy.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.081
Yes, that's probably
a good idea.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.044
Bo, Bo, come here.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.764
Why don't we go over
here for little bit?

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.126
Come over here, honey.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.129
Stop staring.
I can't stop.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:58.561
Last year, the 3rd grade class
picture came out all squinty.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.563
They're interviewing
Bud Bartlett, but

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.440
he doesn't care about
getting a good shot.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.205
I could talk
to the principal and...

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.801
Bo told me tonight.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.889
I actually have to go,
I'm sorry.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.281
I promised my boyfriend
that I'd meet his family.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.761
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.604
Yeah, you should get going.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.165
And, Angie, I...

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.289
I want you to be happy.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.362
Oh, God, what is that?

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.568
I, ugh...

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.921
There goes the tree.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.446
Should we intervene?
They need a referee?

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.280
- It's disturbing.
- It's not safe.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.251
Can I tell you something,
without knowing anything about you?

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.526
I think you need Jello.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.850
You have his smile.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.567
I got lucky.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.242
You know, I think that

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.641
your hands were the first thing
I loved about you.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.766
I'm gonna miss them.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.768
I think, at first, I held on
so tight to the kids because

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.005
of all that we went through
and how much I loved them.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.240
But now...

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.811
I think I'm holding on
because...

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.451
I don't know who I am
if I don't.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.364
My love for them...

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:28.488
it's so huge.
I kinda got lost in it, you know?

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.922
And a part of me,
like you said...

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.088
A part of me got small.
No.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.605
You're not small.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.445
I didn't even agree
with me when I said it.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.090
You're beautiful and ridiculous.

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.730
No.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.491
And as passionate
as you always were.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.729
It's about different things now.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.040
Yeah.

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.561
We had a great run,
Charlotte.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.810
Nobody can say
we didn't try.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.325
No, we tried.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.765
Let's go on the trip.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.330
You don't have to.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.846
No, look at me, honey,
I want to go with you.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.800
Really?

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.363
That's incredible.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.723
Oh, Charlotte...

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.888
I don't really know
if we should go to Africa.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.970
What?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.485
Bo said Hank got laid off.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.767
Oh, my God, I knew it.

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.285
The tell tale snort.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.805
That snort.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.087
But, I can...

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.050
take you out to
a really amazing dinner.

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.044
We could go to some
fancy Ethiopian place

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.645
with native dress.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.883
You can take me to IHOP,
for all I care.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.960
Yeah, me too.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.126
Oh, my...

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.286
Hi, Sam.
Hi.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.046
Good for them.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.444
Why waste a moment?
We're here for such a short time.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.007
I need a last minute gift that
doesn't involve teddy bears,

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.402
balloons or pictures
of children with big eyes.

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.931
You can never
go wrong with chocolate.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.604
No.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.163
Get me the most expensive thing
that you have.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.803
You shouldn't have done this.
I feel so ridiculous.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.086
Here we go. Oh!

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.766
Emma, no!

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.205
No, look...

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.009
What?

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.527
That's the most expensive
thing they had.

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.803
I really like it.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.850
'Cause what says Christmas
better than a shower seat?

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.251
Exactly. Well said.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.005
I could really use
that shower seat.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.170
Merry Christmas.
To you, Mom.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.447
To family.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.841
<i>Bucky woke up with
an unexpected craving for lime Jello.</i>

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.523
<i>As everyone sat
around the table,</i>

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.410
<i>the past, present and future
were coming together</i>

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.482
<i>for one elusive night.</i>

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.489
<i>Fate was kind, playing
that particular muzak just then.</i>

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.491
Um, excuse me, Madison.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.961
Might I steal this man
away from you?

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.246
Oh, yeah?

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.129
Uh-huh. Can I?
Mom.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.280
<i>Sam and Charlotte relished
in the closeness</i>

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.041
<i>brought on by the time
well spent on the trip not yet taken.</i>

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.525
I still got it.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.600
I've never seen that.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.240
Are they are really doing this?

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.963
<i>Eleanor let go of her past
enough to be in the present.</i>

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.528
<i>Instead of trying to present
the perfect picture,</i>

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.365
<i>Hank celebrated this moment
un-photoshopped.</i>

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.810
Do you want to dance?

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.570
Me?

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.961
<i>Hank and Ruby took
their first step on the right foot.</i>

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.964
<i>All the more meaningful,
because Bucky had led them to it.</i>

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.963
Whoo!

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.450
<i>And Charlie would always
remember his first kiss.</i>

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.286
<i>His sloppy, awkward,
but very first kiss.</i>

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.007
You look pretty, Emma.
Do you want to dance?

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.411
Gosh, I would love to dance.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.403
I would really love to dance.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.007
<i>Emma finally recognized she was
already part of a large family.</i>

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.649
As Bucky stood, taking them in,
<i>his family unaware of him,</i>

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.290
<i>this thought entered his head,</i>

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.442
<i>which he shared with
a large Haitian orderly.</i>

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.640
Such a fuss...

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.089
when everything we want is right
in front of us the whole time.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.165
<i>And at last, everyone
appreciated that very sentiment.</i>

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.050
<i>Why is it they can never
remember that?</i>

01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.842
<i>Or maybe the point is, even
just for a moment, they do.</i>

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.328
<i>Well, that's my tale.</i>

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.722
<i>Sometimes, I wonder about
all the families sharing dinner together.</i>

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480
<i>Each house,</i>

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.960
<i>each family,</i>

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.689
<i>each one with stories
of their own.</i>

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.682
<i>I don't know who chooses
our families for us.</i>

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.764
<i>Or if there's a reason
we land where we do.</i>

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.525
<i>But my family
will be home soon.</i>

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.251
<i>Loyal and affectionate,
but untrainable.</i>

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.527
<i>Perfectly imperfect.</i>

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.931
<i>They're only human.</i>

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.323
<i>And that's enough for me.</i>

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.051
<i>Merry Christmas to all. Woof!</i>

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.323
One, two,
you know what to do.

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:30.647
Round young virgin...

01:46:31.305 --> 01:46:37.912
