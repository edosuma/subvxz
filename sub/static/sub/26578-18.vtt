00:04.030 --> 00:06.342
- May I help you, ma'am?
- I want one of those charge cards

00:06.367 --> 00:07.459
you banks are handing out.

00:07.460 --> 00:09.499
It's not quite as simple as that.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.906
Oh, please. Fred Flintstone has one,

00:10.931 --> 00:12.087
and he lives in a cartoon.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.999
I would need to speak
to your husband about this.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.414
He's gonna tell you the same thing...

00:15.439 --> 00:17.039
He's the one who watches
"The Flintstones."

00:17.064 --> 00:19.508
And I'm kind of in a hurry.
I was at the market next door,

00:19.533 --> 00:20.982
I came up six dollars short,
and I had to leave

00:21.007 --> 00:22.378
my frozen food at the checkout counter.

00:22.418 --> 00:23.895
You've got to be kidding me.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.972
<i>We need to open up another register.</i>

00:24.997 --> 00:26.619
I'm sure she'll be right back.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.959
I have perishables!

00:27.960 --> 00:29.691
As you can see, Mrs. Cleary,

00:29.738 --> 00:31.453
you can't get a card on your own

00:31.454 --> 00:32.753
without Mr. Cleary co-signing.

00:32.753 --> 00:34.003
And why not?

00:34.004 --> 00:36.503
The bank is nervous about gals

00:36.504 --> 00:38.253
getting carried away
at the department store.

00:38.254 --> 00:39.793
What if you bought a dozen hats

00:39.794 --> 00:41.373
and then couldn't pay for them?

00:41.374 --> 00:44.003
I would never put something on
my head that wasn't paid for.

00:44.004 --> 00:46.043
Give this application to Mr. Cleary

00:46.044 --> 00:47.793
or any male family member...

00:47.794 --> 00:49.253
a father, brother.

00:49.254 --> 00:50.623
Do you have an adult son?

00:50.624 --> 00:52.373
You would trust one of my idiot sons,

00:52.374 --> 00:53.746
and you won't trust me with six dollars?

00:53.771 --> 00:54.794
We have an account here.

00:54.795 --> 00:56.503
It's in your husband's name.

00:56.504 --> 00:59.043
I'm sorry, but I can't help you
without him present.

00:59.044 --> 01:00.856
What if I told you I had a gun?

01:01.914 --> 01:03.082
The woman says she has a gun.

01:05.913 --> 01:08.023
<i>This was funny back in 1972,</i>

01:08.048 --> 01:10.054
<i>because back then
there were still a few people</i>

01:10.079 --> 01:11.296
<i>who didn't carry guns.</i>

01:11.344 --> 01:12.713
Now, if your <i> husband </i> came in here

01:12.714 --> 01:14.513
and said that he had a gun,

01:14.514 --> 01:16.634
um, that I would take seriously.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.963
<i>My dad had always
done all the shopping...</i>

01:20.964 --> 01:22.963
<i>watching every penny like a hawk.</i>

01:22.964 --> 01:25.883
<i>A hawk who had lived through
the Great hawk Depression.</i>

01:25.884 --> 01:28.213
<i>When my mom got her license,
she took over this chore,</i>

01:28.214 --> 01:30.213
<i>but he couldn't help second-guessing.</i>

01:30.214 --> 01:31.513
You didn't buy Raisin Bran?

01:31.514 --> 01:33.013
How am I gonna get the trains moving?

01:33.014 --> 01:34.923
They had a two-for-one deal
on Shredded Wheat.

01:34.924 --> 01:36.303
Eh, it's not a deal if nobody eats it.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.633
Oh, they'll eat it,
whether they know it or not.

01:38.634 --> 01:40.633
Can I see the receipt?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.423
I'd love to daydream
about the lake house I'll buy

01:42.424 --> 01:44.710
with all that Shredded Wheat savings.

01:48.203 --> 01:49.529
- Lawrence.
- Aah!

01:50.514 --> 01:52.005
Wendi, sorry.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.289
I thought you were that possum.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.060
A possum knows your name?

01:55.085 --> 01:56.183
I need a hand with something.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.263
Sure, but, uh, where's Eddie?

01:58.264 --> 01:59.893
<i>He's</i> what I need a hand with.

01:59.894 --> 02:01.893
We went to this sunrise
wedding at the beach.

02:01.894 --> 02:03.853
- Groovy.
- Pretty nice.

02:03.854 --> 02:05.223
Uh, the romantic mood was dampened

02:05.224 --> 02:07.263
- by a rotting whale carcass.
- Yeah.

02:07.264 --> 02:09.393
Anyway, certain substances
were passed around

02:09.394 --> 02:11.013
and hit Eddie pretty hard.

02:11.014 --> 02:13.222
He wound up skinny dipping
with most of the groomsmen

02:13.247 --> 02:15.143
- and the grandfather of the bride.
- But he's okay?

02:15.144 --> 02:17.053
He's asleep in the back
of the station wagon.

02:17.054 --> 02:20.223
I never found his clothes
but covered him in beach towels

02:20.224 --> 02:21.813
and a discarded bridesmaid dress.

02:21.814 --> 02:23.053
Sounds like a good time.

02:23.054 --> 02:25.473
I hoped I could get him into bed
without your parents knowing,

02:25.474 --> 02:26.784
but he's heavy...

02:26.809 --> 02:28.784
- we might even need Frank's help.
- Not advisable.

02:30.014 --> 02:31.643
- Hey, Frank.
- Oh, hey.

02:31.644 --> 02:34.053
I'm cool either way,
but did I just hear,

02:34.054 --> 02:35.973
like, a-a girl's voice in here

02:35.974 --> 02:38.973
behind a closed door?

02:38.974 --> 02:41.183
I can promise you
there's no girl in here.

02:41.184 --> 02:43.513
I wouldn't mind or tell anyone,

02:43.514 --> 02:45.513
just maybe congratulate you

02:45.514 --> 02:47.103
on your romantic proficiency.

02:47.104 --> 02:48.434
Thanks, man.

02:49.354 --> 02:50.264
Carry on.

02:56.014 --> 02:58.313
Thirty cents a pound for ground beef.

02:58.314 --> 03:00.513
- Attagirl.
- I asked for the stuff in the back

03:00.514 --> 03:02.313
that was past its expiration date.

03:02.314 --> 03:05.103
Oh, here's something else
for you to look at.

03:05.104 --> 03:06.813
- I stopped over at the bank.
- The bank?

03:06.814 --> 03:08.553
I'm also thinking about getting a gun.

03:08.554 --> 03:10.263
That's crazy. A charge card?

03:10.264 --> 03:11.973
So I don't have to talk with you
every time I do the shopping.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.433
I don't mind you coming to me.

03:13.434 --> 03:14.643
Gives us a new area for conversation.

03:14.644 --> 03:16.103
It gets a little stale

03:16.104 --> 03:17.433
always talking about
how dumb the kids are.

03:17.434 --> 03:19.603
That's a well that never runs dry.

03:19.604 --> 03:21.393
This one choked on his fist today.

03:21.394 --> 03:23.103
It was hysterical.

03:23.104 --> 03:25.353
I'm just saying, a charge card
would make things easier.

03:25.354 --> 03:27.223
Lucifer's apple.

03:27.224 --> 03:29.473
Tricking women into spending
beyond their means...

03:29.474 --> 03:31.603
going crazy, buying a bunch of hats.

03:31.604 --> 03:34.053
Ha!

03:34.054 --> 03:35.723
Wait a minute. That's not right.

03:41.184 --> 03:43.103
I <i> knew</i> it!

03:43.104 --> 03:45.183
I don't know what you were
referring to, but I concur.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.973
That cashier at the market's a thief.

03:46.974 --> 03:48.603
And not much of a babysitter, either.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.683
She charged me for one
of my "free" Shredded Wheats.

03:50.684 --> 03:52.393
Did she at least give you green stamps?

03:52.394 --> 03:54.143
She did <i> not.</i>

03:54.144 --> 03:56.183
- Where's the station wagon?
- Out front.

03:56.184 --> 03:57.393
Maybe they pulled this crap on Mike

03:57.394 --> 03:58.764
but not on me, buster!

03:59.894 --> 04:02.683
Unbelievable. Enough is enough!

04:02.684 --> 04:04.263
Hi, Mrs. Cleary.

04:05.644 --> 04:07.013
Oh, no.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.893
What'd you jackals do to your mom?

04:08.894 --> 04:10.788
- We have no idea!
- Nothing worse than usual.

04:11.974 --> 04:13.853
She drove away.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.513
In the station wagon? No!

04:15.514 --> 04:16.814
Did you leave something in the car?

04:18.014 --> 04:19.973
Just a... sun hat.

04:19.974 --> 04:22.055
You women with your hats.

04:25.147 --> 04:27.554
So, who set her off this time?

04:27.579 --> 04:29.183
It was me! She knows!

04:29.184 --> 04:30.853
Mom knows everything!

04:30.854 --> 04:32.603
Any idea where she might be going?

04:32.604 --> 04:34.723
I'm just really worried about that hat.

04:34.724 --> 04:36.513
She does this kind of thing sometimes.

04:36.514 --> 04:39.183
A possum just leapt out of my freezer!

04:39.184 --> 04:40.813
Sorry, we really thought he was dead.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.183
Yeah, he must've been playing po...

04:43.184 --> 04:44.853
<i>That's</i> where that expression comes from!

04:44.854 --> 04:47.553
I have had it with your shenanigans!

04:47.554 --> 04:50.353
Enough... is enough!

04:50.354 --> 04:52.080
- Mom!
- We just didn't want him to smell

04:52.104 --> 04:53.407
before the service!

04:53.432 --> 04:55.183
<i>As bad as it felt when Mom yelled at us,</i>

04:55.184 --> 04:56.763
<i>it was exponentially worse</i>

04:56.764 --> 04:58.643
<i>when she simply withdrew to her room</i>

04:58.644 --> 05:01.973
<i>with the clear implication that
we'd lost her love forever.</i>

05:01.974 --> 05:04.223
Mom, we'll never do it again, I swear!

05:04.224 --> 05:05.683
I didn't even know about it,

05:05.684 --> 05:07.103
but I'm sorry, too!

05:07.104 --> 05:08.893
Usually when she's upset like this,

05:08.894 --> 05:10.763
she locks herself
in her room for an hour.

05:10.764 --> 05:12.369
Yeah, but now she's in
a room with wheels,

05:12.394 --> 05:13.763
and it can go anywhere!

05:13.764 --> 05:16.263
What were we thinking when
we let her get a license?

05:16.264 --> 05:18.683
You savages better hope
that she comes back,

05:18.684 --> 05:20.013
because without that woman,

05:20.014 --> 05:22.944
you're all in the streets
eating garbage.

05:24.814 --> 05:26.014
So the food will be better.

05:27.264 --> 05:29.103
It was nice knowing you all.

05:29.104 --> 05:31.522
I'm gonna go live in
the wilderness like Mowgli.

05:33.604 --> 05:36.053
I keep thinking I may be
responsible for this.

05:36.054 --> 05:38.053
It's that darn smart mouth of mine.

05:38.054 --> 05:41.643
Mom said, "Good morning,"
and I said, "Is it?"

05:41.644 --> 05:43.683
I can be rather salty
before I've had my cocoa.

05:43.684 --> 05:45.103
Pretty sure you're in the clear.

05:45.104 --> 05:47.723
What's the point of sweating
about who did what?

05:47.724 --> 05:49.813
Eventually, Mom will come home
and squash one of us.

05:49.814 --> 05:51.643
Make the most of the time you have...

05:51.644 --> 05:53.263
enjoy the things you cherish.

05:53.264 --> 05:55.013
I'm gonna nap,
then call the bowling alley

05:55.014 --> 05:57.514
and ask if they have ten-pound balls.

06:01.604 --> 06:03.643
Hey, was Mom in here before?

06:03.644 --> 06:05.473
I don't know.

06:05.474 --> 06:07.433
'Cause my bag was here

06:07.434 --> 06:09.053
and now it's here.

06:09.054 --> 06:10.933
I run my whole business out of that bag.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.053
<i>Joey's business was procuring girls</i>

06:13.054 --> 06:15.433
<i>for hormonally over-eager teenage boys.</i>

06:15.434 --> 06:19.513
<i>Not actual girls, but
their lovely, undraped images.</i>

06:21.104 --> 06:23.393
<i>Then he realized
he could maximize profits</i>

06:23.394 --> 06:27.103
<i>by breaking the images down
into their individual parts.</i>

06:31.934 --> 06:33.853
I've got a kid who just wants feet.

06:33.854 --> 06:36.353
Hey, we use every part of the buffalo,

06:36.354 --> 06:40.973
which is actually where
Tiffani goes to Law School.

06:40.974 --> 06:42.053
I think you're in the clear, man.

06:42.054 --> 06:43.723
Nothing you do is gonna shock Mom

06:43.724 --> 06:45.723
- after the stuff you've pulled.
- That's true.

06:45.724 --> 06:47.933
She's totally given up
on my immortal soul.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.683
Unfortunately, she still
has hope for me.

06:49.684 --> 06:52.223
I think I know what set her off.

06:52.224 --> 06:54.643
Remember that stain I got
on her nice tablecloth?

06:54.644 --> 06:57.013
I will now perform the "Immovable Feast"

06:57.014 --> 06:59.603
using Mom's linen tablecloth
from her grandmother.

06:59.604 --> 07:02.393
Behold, as the tablecloth moves

07:02.394 --> 07:03.684
but the dinner...

07:07.394 --> 07:09.321
...stands still!

07:10.314 --> 07:12.553
<i>Like many misdeeds from the 1970s,</i>

07:12.554 --> 07:14.353
<i>my cover-up was worse than the crime.</i>

07:16.054 --> 07:17.734
I'll just get in the box,
and you can bury me.

07:17.759 --> 07:19.053
I've seen worse.

07:19.054 --> 07:21.508
Spaghetti sauce is a piece
of cake compared to blood.

07:21.533 --> 07:22.973
Or cake.

07:22.974 --> 07:24.572
Relax, I've got a guy.

07:24.626 --> 07:26.263
<i>Mom won.</i>

07:26.264 --> 07:27.893
<i>She not only got the Shredded
Wheat they owed her,</i>

07:27.894 --> 07:29.353
<i>but the store took the money for it</i>

07:29.354 --> 07:31.053
<i>out of the cashier's paycheck.</i>

07:36.354 --> 07:38.167
What in the blazes?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.223
Pat?

07:41.224 --> 07:43.263
It's like they're trying
to put me in the nuthouse.

07:43.264 --> 07:45.053
<i>Fearing my mom never stopped
my brothers and me</i>

07:45.054 --> 07:47.313
<i>from trying to get away
with stuff, but not Pat.</i>

07:47.314 --> 07:49.473
<i>He believed our mother was omniscient.</i>

07:49.474 --> 07:51.103
<i>And that's just how she liked it.</i>

07:51.104 --> 07:52.973
That suitcase must be
getting awfully heavy.

07:52.974 --> 07:55.473
Just some clothes, and a toothbrush...

07:55.474 --> 07:57.103
And your pet bricks?

07:58.764 --> 08:02.643
- You really do know everything.
- And don't you forget it.

08:07.025 --> 08:08.184
- William!
- Yeah.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.223
Give me a hand here.

08:09.224 --> 08:10.813
With your mom gone AWOL,

08:10.814 --> 08:12.553
can you help me get Andy
ready for his day?

08:12.554 --> 08:15.293
His day? Does he have
an important business meeting?

08:16.517 --> 08:19.386
I'm sorry, Dad. That's my
smart mouth rearing up again.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.394
I don't think a kid should lay
around all day in his pajamas.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.128
Lack of structure is the surest
road to mental illness.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.128
You take care of this whole deal.

08:27.129 --> 08:28.628
It might help smooth things over
with your mom.

08:28.629 --> 08:30.008
Wait, you think she's mad at <i> me?</i>

08:30.009 --> 08:31.338
Could be any one of you kids.

08:31.339 --> 08:32.628
The only thing we know for sure is,

08:32.629 --> 08:34.587
it ain't me.

08:34.589 --> 08:39.048
<i>It was then Dad realized
that he might be the culprit.</i>

08:39.049 --> 08:42.226
- I'm an idiot.
- No argument here.

08:42.259 --> 08:44.435
Wow, I'm so sorry, Dad.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.418
I've got to get some more cocoa in me.

08:46.419 --> 08:49.128
Maybe we should drive around,
see if we can find your mom

08:49.129 --> 08:50.758
before she finds Eddie in the backseat,

08:50.759 --> 08:52.216
spare them both the embarrassment.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.878
Or be right there to see it play out.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.418
Let me grab a sweatshirt...

08:55.419 --> 08:56.759
and a camera.

09:01.259 --> 09:02.548
Holy crap.

09:02.549 --> 09:04.298
That is blasphemy, mister.

09:04.299 --> 09:05.655
Unless you're talking about a diaper

09:05.680 --> 09:07.179
left in the manger by Baby Jesus.

09:07.204 --> 09:09.323
Is this maybe the reason
Mom was so upset?

09:09.324 --> 09:11.283
Was she out here with my journal
before she ran off?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.583
<i>Frank knew Mom was angry
at the store cashier</i>

09:13.584 --> 09:15.083
<i>but decided to exploit the situation</i>

09:15.084 --> 09:16.993
<i>for his own twisted agenda.</i>

09:16.994 --> 09:18.623
Yes. Right before.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.323
Yeah, she totally read it.

09:20.324 --> 09:22.953
Who else around here would do
something so insensitive?

09:22.954 --> 09:26.163
He talks about Mom, like, on every page.

09:26.164 --> 09:28.163
What's a "raging narcissist"?

09:28.164 --> 09:30.083
It's "raging," so it's not good.

09:30.084 --> 09:32.913
Oh, this is too juicy.
I can read this thing all...

09:32.914 --> 09:34.913
Hey, those two squirrels are doin' it.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.283
But what in your journal
could've upset Mom?

09:39.284 --> 09:41.953
It's not like there's anything
negative to be said about her.

09:41.954 --> 09:44.373
Did you compliment her too much?

09:44.374 --> 09:46.953
Sometimes when I do that,
it gets on her nerves.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.083
I don't know how I'm gonna face
her when she gets back, man.

09:49.084 --> 09:52.163
When Mom and I talk about you...
and we often do...

09:52.164 --> 09:54.163
an especially sore subject

09:54.164 --> 09:57.083
is that San Francisco-style rat's nest.

09:57.084 --> 09:59.033
- My hair bothers her that much?
- Mm.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.953
- She hasn't said anything to me.
- Well, you know Mom.

10:00.954 --> 10:02.623
She doesn't like to criticize.

10:02.624 --> 10:04.123
But it would be a nice gesture

10:04.124 --> 10:06.033
if you went out and
got a respectable crew-cut.

10:06.034 --> 10:08.743
It's just...

10:08.744 --> 10:10.123
chicks dig it, man.

10:10.124 --> 10:11.993
I know one very important "chick"

10:11.994 --> 10:14.323
who looks at it and "dies inside"...

10:14.324 --> 10:16.413
her words.

10:16.414 --> 10:18.913
- Can we go?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

10:18.914 --> 10:20.904
There's actually something
I need to go do.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.641
One dirty hippie down,

10:24.666 --> 10:25.950
five million to go.

10:28.988 --> 10:31.301
I had to run away after the thing I did.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.663
- But you already know all about it.
- Of course I do.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.892
But I like hearing you say

10:36.917 --> 10:38.323
exactly what you're sorry about.

10:38.324 --> 10:42.095
Two days ago, I put an ice cube
up my nose, and it got stuck.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.545
I didn't tell anyone,

10:43.570 --> 10:46.493
so now I have an ice cube
in my nose forever.

10:46.494 --> 10:48.953
Not forever.

10:48.954 --> 10:52.203
But it is gonna be a painful
and expensive surgery.

10:52.204 --> 10:53.953
What's this hullabaloo?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.123
Excuse me. Can I get through?

10:56.124 --> 10:57.913
Nope. Road's closed.

10:57.914 --> 10:59.663
I need to get this child home
for his treatment.

10:59.664 --> 11:01.743
Look at him. He's obviously not right.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.163
I need a painful and expensive surgery.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.663
Oh, looks like a tough little guy,

11:05.664 --> 11:07.743
uh, despite his obstacles,

11:07.744 --> 11:09.993
but we won't be finished here
'til like six.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.123
You want to go down to
the second corner, make a right,

11:12.124 --> 11:13.583
take the underpass, then a right,

11:13.584 --> 11:14.993
then another right,
and then, uh, veer left...

11:14.994 --> 11:17.760
- you'll be good.
- Right, right, underpass...

11:17.785 --> 11:19.663
My mom doesn't need you
telling her where to go.

11:19.664 --> 11:22.112
- She knows everything.
- Absolutely.

11:22.137 --> 11:23.413
I've got it.

11:23.414 --> 11:24.783
We'll be okay.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.769
Yes, you will, little soldier.

11:26.794 --> 11:27.963
Yes, you will.

11:27.964 --> 11:30.253
Here you go.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.043
My sister's kid
wears protective headgear.

11:32.044 --> 11:34.383
- It's a big help.
- Hooray!

11:42.004 --> 11:43.423
Oh, Wendi.

11:43.424 --> 11:45.293
I need your woman ears on something.

11:45.294 --> 11:47.843
Earlier, Mrs. Cleary gave me
this charge card application,

11:47.844 --> 11:50.713
and I said no for a host
of excellent reasons.

11:50.714 --> 11:53.043
- Like what?
- I-Innumerable,

11:53.044 --> 11:54.793
each one better than the last.

11:54.794 --> 11:56.253
You think it's possible

11:56.254 --> 11:57.793
that this is what threw her
into a tizzy?

11:57.794 --> 11:59.673
I'd be very offended

11:59.674 --> 12:01.713
if I felt my husband
didn't trust me with money.

12:01.714 --> 12:03.043
I give Peggy an allowance every week.

12:03.044 --> 12:04.543
- Like a child.
- No!

12:04.544 --> 12:06.213
I don't give my children an allowance.

12:06.214 --> 12:07.713
Their allowance is me allowance-ing them

12:07.714 --> 12:09.793
- to live in my house.
- And Mrs. Cleary's house.

12:09.794 --> 12:12.633
Fine, Helen Reddy, it's her house, too.

12:12.634 --> 12:15.673
Maybe I need to go and find her.

12:15.674 --> 12:17.463
- Can I come?
- If you want.

12:17.464 --> 12:18.963
It's weird she hasn't come home.

12:18.964 --> 12:20.673
She might've run out of gas
and, you know,

12:20.674 --> 12:23.043
- doesn't have a charge card.
- You're right.

12:23.044 --> 12:24.843
She's a space cadet when it
comes to watching the gauge.

12:26.584 --> 12:28.383
What is that stuff?

12:28.384 --> 12:30.253
Dry-cleaning chemicals.

12:30.254 --> 12:32.293
- Your friend's a dry cleaner?
- Well, Sid's a pool guy,

12:32.294 --> 12:34.003
and he does some embalming on the side,

12:34.004 --> 12:36.083
but he swears it's all the same stuff.

12:36.084 --> 12:37.583
Is it safe?

12:37.584 --> 12:40.253
Uh, they put it in pools
and dead people, so, yeah.

12:41.464 --> 12:43.673
Although...

12:43.674 --> 12:46.253
...it smells "pwitty"...

12:46.254 --> 12:49.043
You said "pwitty,"

12:49.044 --> 12:50.884
not "pwitty."

12:52.044 --> 12:53.754
For some reason I can't say...

12:58.084 --> 12:59.463
Joey.

12:59.464 --> 13:00.713
Joey, how long were we...

13:00.714 --> 13:02.883
An hour.

13:02.884 --> 13:05.003
In retrospect, we probably
should've cracked a window.

13:05.004 --> 13:06.794
An hour?! What's this stuff done to...

13:08.134 --> 13:09.503
It worked!

13:09.504 --> 13:11.633
- It's all clean!
- Yeah, it's pretty!

13:11.634 --> 13:13.213
Hey, I can say "pretty" again!

13:13.214 --> 13:15.633
Let's dry it out in the sun
before Mom gets home.

13:15.634 --> 13:18.043
Cool! Check it out.

13:18.044 --> 13:19.963
No more fingerprints.

13:19.964 --> 13:21.843
♪ You put your right foot in ♪

13:21.844 --> 13:23.633
♪ You put your left foot in ♪

13:23.634 --> 13:25.583
- ♪ You do the Hokey Pokey ♪
- It's a right, then a left...

13:25.584 --> 13:27.633
- ♪ And you turn yourself around ♪
- ...then another left...

13:27.634 --> 13:29.673
- ♪ Then put your left foot in ♪
- ...then another right...

13:29.674 --> 13:31.423
- Right!
- That's not it.

13:31.424 --> 13:34.133
- Pat, you need to stop singing that song.
- Why?

13:34.134 --> 13:36.843
Do you know what a "Hokey Pokey" is?

13:36.844 --> 13:39.253
It's a stew cannibals make.

13:39.254 --> 13:40.843
"Put your left foot in.
Put your right foot in."

13:40.844 --> 13:43.173
It's not a song. It's a recipe.

13:43.174 --> 13:45.083
That's what it's all about?

13:45.084 --> 13:48.583
<i>Before GPS, getting lost was
a thing that actually happened.</i>

13:48.584 --> 13:50.624
Are we lost, Mommy?

13:50.649 --> 13:52.849
How could we be lost
when I know everything?

13:53.884 --> 13:56.083
I do have to pull over and
make a call to the doctor

13:56.084 --> 13:57.793
to schedule your nose surgery.

13:57.794 --> 13:59.995
I can't even feel it up there anymore.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.860
That's not a good sign.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.093
I get why we looked for her
at the church,

14:06.118 --> 14:07.367
but the gun store?

14:07.392 --> 14:09.343
Ah, it's just something
she said in passing.

14:09.344 --> 14:12.084
On "Columbo," it's usually
the most important clue.

14:13.844 --> 14:15.673
Where could she have gone?

14:15.674 --> 14:18.503
It's dry! I-I think it looks
even better than before.

14:18.504 --> 14:19.892
We should fold it up before those

14:19.917 --> 14:22.383
squirrels decide it's the grotto
at the Playboy Mansion.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.583
Are we sure it wasn't already like that?

14:31.714 --> 14:33.936
Cleary residence.

14:33.961 --> 14:35.561
<i>Will you accept a collect call</i>

14:35.586 --> 14:37.061
<i>from Mrs. Michael Cleary?</i>

14:37.086 --> 14:38.305
<i>We'd all been trained from birth</i>

14:38.330 --> 14:40.133
<i>not to ever accept
collect calls, no matter what.</i>

14:40.134 --> 14:42.083
<i>Which is why we never got to say goodbye</i>

14:42.084 --> 14:44.883
<i>- to our Great-Aunt Esther.</i>
- Come on, come on...

14:44.884 --> 14:47.503
We do not accept collect calls
no matter what.

14:48.674 --> 14:50.633
I can't pay for the call, operator.

14:50.634 --> 14:52.673
I had to use all my change
at the supermarket yesterday

14:52.674 --> 14:54.173
because I didn't have a gun.

14:59.634 --> 15:01.713
Hi, Eddie!

15:01.714 --> 15:04.218
Shh! Don't tell Mom you saw me.

15:04.243 --> 15:05.463
I'm gonna thumb a ride home.

15:05.464 --> 15:08.423
Which, in this outfit's either gonna
be really hard or really easy.

15:08.424 --> 15:11.085
You can't fool Mom.
She already knows you're here.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.543
Yes, I know you think that

15:12.544 --> 15:14.673
because <i> you</i> think Mom knows everything.

15:14.674 --> 15:17.543
I think that because she's right there.

15:22.647 --> 15:25.066
I don't see her.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.277
Then I don't know where else to look.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.293
Why did you think she might come here?

15:29.324 --> 15:31.613
Well, this place is kind of
a running joke for us.

15:31.638 --> 15:34.687
Any time we argue,
Peggy threatens to run off

15:34.688 --> 15:36.267
to the bar at the Ambassador Hotel.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.477
Isn't this where Robert Kennedy...

15:38.478 --> 15:40.637
Yeah, and another infamous event...

15:40.638 --> 15:42.937
Peg and I honeymooned here

15:42.938 --> 15:44.637
back when a room went for top dollar,

15:44.638 --> 15:46.938
before the Sirhan Sirhan
discount kicked in.

15:49.978 --> 15:52.597
I'll have a Chablis.

15:52.598 --> 15:54.937
I meant to say a "lemonade."

15:54.938 --> 15:56.123
I'll have a water.

15:57.653 --> 15:59.192
So, I thought she'd like that I splurged

15:59.217 --> 16:01.807
for a $40 room for our honeymoon.

16:01.808 --> 16:04.267
But Peggy got mad at me
for wasting our money.

16:04.268 --> 16:08.322
Somewhere mid-ceremony,
it became <i> our</i> money.

16:10.587 --> 16:12.876
I had cash in the bank
and savings bonds.

16:12.877 --> 16:15.036
The only thing of value
she brought to the table

16:15.037 --> 16:16.746
was her grandmother's linen tablecloth.

16:16.747 --> 16:18.126
And the fact that you loved her.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.956
Yeah, that's how they get you.

16:19.957 --> 16:22.826
That was our first big fight.

16:22.827 --> 16:24.456
After I cooled off, I came down here,

16:24.457 --> 16:25.657
I found her, we made up.

16:25.682 --> 16:28.826
Thank God she came to her senses
and apologized to me.

16:28.827 --> 16:30.166
<i>She</i> apologized to <i> you?</i>

16:30.167 --> 16:33.962
I thought the whole money issue
was settled.

16:33.987 --> 16:36.826
That's why this charge card
thing is such a puzzler.

16:36.827 --> 16:40.496
It's not that hard of a puzzle
to put together, Mr. Cleary.

16:40.497 --> 16:42.496
Kind of like Baby Andy's cow puzzle.

16:42.497 --> 16:44.786
Just a cow and a cow-shaped hole.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.326
That puzzle was Eddie's.

16:47.327 --> 16:49.086
Tripped him up for years.

16:49.087 --> 16:51.326
Sir.

16:51.327 --> 16:52.956
See that?

16:52.957 --> 16:55.376
He looked at the two of us
together and decided

16:55.377 --> 16:57.746
<i>you're</i> the one who's going to pay.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.456
Oh, that's 'cause he doesn't know me.

16:59.457 --> 17:02.166
This is what Mrs. Cleary
is dealing with.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.996
Everyone assumes she needs
a man to pay her way,

17:04.997 --> 17:06.826
even for a 60-cent lemonade.

17:06.827 --> 17:08.457
60 cents?

17:10.247 --> 17:13.165
You feel it's your money because
your name is on the paycheck,

17:13.166 --> 17:15.665
while, in so many ways,
she supports your life

17:15.666 --> 17:17.165
so you're free to earn that check.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.165
But the world doesn't value
what she does.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.826
It's a double standard.

17:20.827 --> 17:23.536
So, what Peggy does,
puttering around the house,

17:23.537 --> 17:25.246
is somehow comparable to my job?

17:25.247 --> 17:28.326
I literally helped put
Neil Armstrong on the moon.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.126
She <i> literally</i> helped Eddie

17:30.127 --> 17:31.826
finally put that cow in the hole.

17:31.827 --> 17:32.996
He'd have figured it out eventually.

17:32.997 --> 17:34.456
He got the pig right away.

17:34.457 --> 17:35.826
Excuse me, Miss.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.126
You need to take
your business elsewhere.

17:37.127 --> 17:39.326
- My business?
- What's going on, pal?

17:39.327 --> 17:41.626
We do not allow solicitation
on these premises.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.416
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.166
This is my son's girlfriend.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.126
Oh, I haven't heard that one before.

17:47.127 --> 17:48.586
Usually it's the "niece."

17:48.587 --> 17:50.036
I'm not soliciting anything.

17:50.037 --> 17:52.246
In fact, I even paid
for my own lemonade.

17:52.247 --> 17:53.536
You're free to stay
and enjoy your drink, sir,

17:53.537 --> 17:54.996
but she has to go.

17:54.997 --> 17:57.376
Now, that is a heck
of a double standard.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.626
If I am paying for
the company of this woman,

17:59.627 --> 18:02.126
I am just as much a lawbreaker
as my prostitute here!

18:02.127 --> 18:04.876
- I'm no one's...
- Fine, then you can go, too.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.246
Oh, I'd like to see you try and make me.

18:06.247 --> 18:08.206
Let's just leave, Mr. Cleary.

18:08.207 --> 18:09.706
Do I have to call the authorities?

18:09.707 --> 18:11.246
You know what? Call 'em.

18:11.247 --> 18:14.827
I'll report you for the crime
of a 60-cent lemonade.

18:16.377 --> 18:17.786
I'll have you know,

18:17.787 --> 18:19.723
this is a very nice dress.

18:19.748 --> 18:21.538
I bought it at The Limited.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.746
It was a crazy scene...

18:29.747 --> 18:31.876
everyone tearing their clothes
off and jumping in the water.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.666
And I never would've done it

18:33.667 --> 18:36.246
if I hadn't smoked so much p... p...

18:36.247 --> 18:37.706
peer pressure.

18:37.707 --> 18:39.956
Okay, I'm in the mood to be merciful.

18:39.957 --> 18:42.036
I need to get Pat home,
and I may not know

18:42.037 --> 18:43.548
exactly where our home is at the moment.

18:43.573 --> 18:45.786
Oh, so you're lost.

18:45.787 --> 18:47.746
That's not something
you're gonna let anybody know,

18:47.747 --> 18:49.626
<i>especially </i> that little boy.

18:49.627 --> 18:50.826
He thinks I'm a god.

18:50.827 --> 18:52.536
It'd be cruel to spoil that for him.

18:52.561 --> 18:54.416
It's like telling a child
there's no Tooth Fairy.

18:54.441 --> 18:56.026
We never had the Tooth Fairy.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.376
If I let you kids make money off teeth,

18:57.377 --> 18:59.152
I'd have to hide the pliers.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.916
What do you think?

19:03.917 --> 19:06.246
- Is that the right shade of green?
- Yeah.

19:06.247 --> 19:08.086
I think it looks "pwitty"...

19:08.087 --> 19:09.747
Uh-oh.

19:12.497 --> 19:14.746
Eddie. Mrs. Cleary.

19:14.747 --> 19:16.496
You're home, and you found Eddie,

19:16.497 --> 19:18.416
so it's all okay?

19:18.417 --> 19:20.286
And my mom knows everything.

19:20.287 --> 19:21.666
Of course she knows everything!

19:21.667 --> 19:22.916
She's Mom!

19:22.917 --> 19:25.235
I'm gonna go pack a hospital bag.

19:26.037 --> 19:27.916
You need to put some clothes on.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.492
You got stuff hanging out
nobody wants to see.

19:31.287 --> 19:32.876
Same with you, dear,

19:32.877 --> 19:34.666
but you're some other mother's problem.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.036
Okay, maybe it is
a little revealing, but...

19:38.037 --> 19:39.376
that's the fashion!

19:39.377 --> 19:41.326
More Shredded Wheat.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.650
Nice! I knew you'd set
that store straight.

19:43.675 --> 19:45.228
I hope you got that cashier fired.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.736
- Nope, but I made her cry.
- Excellent.

19:47.761 --> 19:49.916
Mom, uh,

19:49.917 --> 19:51.626
I know you were hurt by
what you read this morning...

19:51.627 --> 19:54.286
For the love of Pete,
what'd you do to your hair?!

19:54.287 --> 19:56.626
I thought you didn't like it.

19:56.627 --> 19:59.286
Well, what gave you
that cockamamie notion?

19:59.287 --> 20:02.064
That crazy mop was the only
thing setting you apart.

20:02.089 --> 20:04.142
Now you're gonna have to work
on your personality.

20:09.827 --> 20:12.956
I'm gonna cut something off of <i> you!</i>

20:18.627 --> 20:20.456
What are you looking at?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.899
Just noticing how good the lawn looks.

20:23.287 --> 20:24.916
So, listen,

20:24.917 --> 20:27.932
I put it together after you drove off

20:27.957 --> 20:29.928
that you were mad at me for what I did.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.098
Yes. What you did.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.590
I thought about it, and I'm sorry.

20:33.591 --> 20:35.090
You should be.

20:35.091 --> 20:38.550
I had to drive around
for hours to cool down.

20:38.551 --> 20:40.590
But just so we can move on,

20:40.591 --> 20:42.880
why don't you say
why you did what you did

20:42.881 --> 20:44.175
and also what you did?

20:46.131 --> 20:47.447
So, it wasn't me that you were mad at.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.210
Took a shot. Always works on the kids.

20:49.211 --> 20:51.460
Yeah, but I'm not the kids.

20:51.461 --> 20:54.050
You're my wife, and we're in
this whole shebang together,

20:54.051 --> 20:55.460
so here.

20:56.961 --> 20:58.630
I stopped by the bank and got that.

20:58.631 --> 21:00.420
It's a temporary.

21:00.421 --> 21:02.418
The real one will come in a week or so.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.170
This means a lot, Mike.

21:06.171 --> 21:08.960
Mostly because I know how hard
it must've been for you.

21:08.961 --> 21:12.548
Well, it's not just my money. It's...

21:13.961 --> 21:16.800
- ...our money.
- Aww.

21:16.801 --> 21:19.760
This reminds me of our first fight.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.550
We should go to the Ambassador Hotel

21:21.551 --> 21:22.800
and have a drink.

21:22.801 --> 21:25.523
Yeah, I can't go there anymore.

21:25.835 --> 21:30.930
