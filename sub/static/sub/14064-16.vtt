00:15.364 --> 00:18.884
That is some fine
south of the border, Schmidt.

00:19.381 --> 00:20.994
Ivan?

00:21.029 --> 00:22.993
Take me back Shirley, that's all I ask.

00:22.993 --> 00:24.922
You came here to ask me to take you back?

00:24.922 --> 00:26.754
No actually, I'm getting married.

00:26.754 --> 00:28.516
But if you were to take me back.

00:28.516 --> 00:30.901
Married? Ivan, no, we talked about this.

00:30.901 --> 00:33.968
This time It's real, Shirley.
I feel it deep down to my…

00:33.968 --> 00:35.508
Bone, I'm sure.

00:35.543 --> 00:37.895
She's funny, she's smart.
She's practically you,

00:37.895 --> 00:39.184
just a much younger model.

00:39.184 --> 00:40.922
Aw, that's sweet.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.673
Shirley,

00:43.737 --> 00:46.636
I'd like you to be best man.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.639
What do you mean?

00:47.639 --> 00:51.238
If a man wants his closest friend to be
his best man he should have it.

00:51.238 --> 00:53.024
Stand by my side, Shirley.

00:53.059 --> 00:57.299
I want you to give me away.
It's only right.

00:57.334 --> 01:01.504
Uh, first of all you raise several issues.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.700
The first is that the best man
doesn't give the groom away.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.705
The second is that you and I
used to be married

01:07.740 --> 01:12.039
and the third is I'm not a man.

01:12.537 --> 01:15.205
As trustee for my heart
for twenty-five plus years…

01:15.205 --> 01:16.406
We were only married for four.

01:16.406 --> 01:19.166
I have only known two great loves
in my life.

01:19.201 --> 01:20.695
You. And now Missy.

01:20.730 --> 01:25.653
Okay. As far as our great love goes,
you strayed during our honeymoon.

01:25.688 --> 01:30.401
And let's not even discuss
the name Missy, is she a pony?

01:32.485 --> 01:34.864
Be my best man.

02:16.962 --> 02:20.495
So why not do it?
Be in his wedding.

02:20.530 --> 02:23.994
An ex-wife as a best man?
Come on, Paul.

02:24.029 --> 02:28.049
But if you're as close as you say, and
the fiancée is okay with it…

02:28.066 --> 02:31.357
There's also a rehearsal dinner.
He wants me there at that.

02:31.357 --> 02:34.614
All I know is when somebody
asks you to be in his wedding…

02:34.614 --> 02:36.189
How many has he had?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.710
This one will be number six.

02:38.745 --> 02:40.504
Oh.

02:40.564 --> 02:46.598
♫ So thanks again
for the worryin' and waitin' ♫

02:46.633 --> 02:52.483
♫ When I started datin'
on weekend nights ♫

02:52.517 --> 02:58.091
♫ And thanks again for the help
with my homework ♫

02:58.127 --> 03:03.964
♫ And sittin' up with me
till I got it right ♫

03:03.999 --> 03:10.396
♫ Your car for the prom,
your letters in 'Nam ♫

03:10.431 --> 03:16.793
♫ But most of all, Daddy,
for marryin' Mom ♫

03:17.646 --> 03:24.306
♫ To my beautiful life long friends ♫

03:24.341 --> 03:30.966
Hey, Mom and Daddy thanks again.

03:33.401 --> 03:35.847
Sweet song.

03:36.682 --> 03:39.288
Even if I did do it…

03:41.079 --> 03:44.693
Paul? Are you okay?

03:44.728 --> 03:51.826
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just a sap when
it comes to sentimental songs.

03:51.861 --> 03:55.748
If she sings, ‘You light up my life’
I'll be on the floor.

03:55.783 --> 03:57.672
Where were we?

03:57.707 --> 04:01.630
I was obsessing about
my ex-husband's nuptials.

04:03.457 --> 04:07.889
How's your daughter by the way?

04:07.924 --> 04:10.988
Rachel, right?

04:17.202 --> 04:20.696
Alzheimer's was her worst fear.

04:21.286 --> 04:25.649
She had gotten to the point
where she was forgetting,

04:25.684 --> 04:28.472
and she was losing control of her body.

04:28.507 --> 04:31.260
And she begged me to help her do it.

04:31.295 --> 04:33.799
And I complied.

04:34.253 --> 04:35.955
How did you comply?

04:35.990 --> 04:40.890
We had hired a nurse who had previously
worked at a hospice for dying patients

04:40.925 --> 04:43.328
and she was familiar with
setting up morphine drips,

04:43.328 --> 04:46.766
and I persuaded her
to set one up for us

04:46.801 --> 04:50.533
in case pain management
ever became an issue.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.282
And you increased the drip
to cause your wife's death?

04:54.282 --> 04:58.989
Yes. My lawyer is recommending
that I plead to manslaughter

04:59.024 --> 05:03.565
but I simply cannot bring myself
to do that. I am not a criminal.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.567
If you agree to take over, I think that
you should just jump right in.

05:08.602 --> 05:13.535
The case is not very complicated,
and according to our jury consultants,

05:13.570 --> 05:16.898
we have a very sympathetic group impaneled.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.249
Well, if you're serious about
moving forward immediately,

05:20.249 --> 05:23.530
then I would advise you to stay
with your current lawyer.

05:23.530 --> 05:26.400
Well, he doesn't think that he can win it.

05:26.435 --> 05:30.918
And various people are telling me
that you can.

05:52.703 --> 05:54.351
How we doing?

05:58.345 --> 06:01.973
It was as if that song was pointed
right at my head.

06:02.008 --> 06:05.601
I did her homework with her,
I drove her to the prom,

06:05.636 --> 06:08.620
all the nights I waited up.

06:08.655 --> 06:09.778
What happened?

06:09.813 --> 06:11.899
She basically stole from me.

06:11.934 --> 06:12.591
How?

06:12.626 --> 06:13.616
You name it.

06:13.651 --> 06:16.807
She'd feign problems with rent.
Her health. Credit card debt.

06:16.807 --> 06:20.092
She'd invent all kinds of crisis
to impel me to write a check,

06:20.092 --> 06:23.342
the proceeds of which would always go
to feed her drug habit.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.682
The last straw, I got her in a program,

06:25.712 --> 06:29.754
an exclusive one, I told her
if she left she was cut off.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.229
She left?

06:31.264 --> 06:36.032
We had a fight. I haven't
spoken to her since.

06:37.104 --> 06:40.182
That was seven years ago.

06:40.825 --> 06:42.684
You should go see her.

06:45.455 --> 06:50.476
Let's list all the reason not to
and put them under column A.

06:51.063 --> 06:53.039
And column B?

06:54.130 --> 06:56.676
She's your daughter.

07:02.429 --> 07:04.056
Denny Crane. No comment.

07:05.116 --> 07:07.396
The blind shall lead, only in America.

07:09.898 --> 07:11.508
Denny Crane.

07:13.295 --> 07:15.313
I'll ask for a continuance if they won't.

07:15.313 --> 07:16.853
On grounds they're not ready?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.358
Your Honor. This is a tactic.

07:18.358 --> 07:20.388
Mr Shore figures to lose at trial…

07:20.388 --> 07:22.941
I rarely lose. And certainly not to you.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.584
So what he's obviously trying to do here
is pile on as many grounds

07:26.584 --> 07:30.157
for appeal as possible, including
it seems, inadequate counsel.

07:30.157 --> 07:32.637
Do you two have prior relationship?

07:32.672 --> 07:34.108
Yes, Your Honor.

07:34.143 --> 07:37.029
When I was in private practice
Mr Shore hacked

07:37.064 --> 07:40.172
into my client's corporate files
and then blackmailed him.

07:40.172 --> 07:42.400
Successfully. You left that out.

07:42.435 --> 07:44.688
Mr Shore, the court does have concerns

07:44.688 --> 07:47.032
with new counsel taking this over
the day of trial.

07:47.032 --> 07:48.569
My client doesn't want a delay.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.359
You already know he refused to waive
his right to a speedy trial.

07:51.359 --> 07:53.272
Then you're on record as being ready?

07:53.272 --> 07:55.150
We'll bring in the jury at two o'clock.

07:55.150 --> 07:56.274
Thank you.

07:58.193 --> 07:59.379
Are you okay with this?

07:59.379 --> 08:03.819
Oh, I am. You're dear to my Ivan.
And I'm certainly wise enough

08:03.854 --> 08:05.958
to know that the heart wants
what the heart wants.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.599
So long as his penis doesn't weigh in.

08:12.163 --> 08:14.284
She has a funny laugh.
I didn't tell you.

08:14.284 --> 08:15.942
Yes, you left that out.

08:15.977 --> 08:17.601
Bambi's mother got shot.

08:18.316 --> 08:21.069
Sometimes when she starts
she can't stop,

08:21.104 --> 08:24.257
so I have to tell her something tragic
to snap her out of it.

08:24.257 --> 08:27.514
Tell me. What brought you two together?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.710
Well, I'd have to say, church.

08:29.745 --> 08:33.241
Also his sense of humor.
Did he make you giggle?

08:33.275 --> 08:34.895
Only in bed.

08:38.163 --> 08:39.693
It's best not to amuse her.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.212
I can see this.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.547
Bill Buckner.

08:44.075 --> 08:47.406
I apologize.  Anyhow,
where we really connected,

08:47.441 --> 08:50.608
I think, was our love of musical theater.

08:51.582 --> 08:55.673
♫ Anybody could be that guy. ♫

08:55.708 --> 08:57.919
Mama mia.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.159
Here I go again.

09:03.998 --> 09:06.554
I was hired as Mrs Myerson's
private nurse.

09:06.554 --> 09:09.794
I worked in her employ
up until the time of her death.

09:10.461 --> 09:15.149
In fact, Ms Young… it was you
who supplied the defendant with

09:15.184 --> 09:17.690
the morphine and the IV, is that correct?

09:17.725 --> 09:18.627
Yes.

09:18.856 --> 09:21.655
Did he tell you what he wanted
the morphine drip for?

09:21.655 --> 09:25.059
He said if she ever got in too much pain
he wanted to help her manage it.

09:25.059 --> 09:27.427
And how is it you even
had access to this drug?

09:27.427 --> 09:31.067
I had worked at a hospice for people
dying of terminal diseases.

09:31.067 --> 09:33.432
It was quite common for morphine drips

09:33.467 --> 09:36.008
to be used in connection
with pain management.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.480
But don't you typically need a prescription?

09:38.480 --> 09:42.561
Ordinarily, but I have a small stockpile,
I guess would be the word.

09:42.596 --> 09:46.676
I never thought Mr Myerson would use it
to actually cause her death.

09:49.888 --> 09:52.334
You stated you never thought my client

09:52.369 --> 09:55.110
would use the morphine
to cause his wife's death.

09:55.110 --> 09:58.373
would that be because you knew him
to love his wife very much?

09:58.373 --> 10:00.363
That would be one reason, yes.

10:00.398 --> 10:04.150
Did Mrs Myerson ever communicate
to you that she would rather die

10:04.150 --> 10:08.692
than live through the experience of her brain
being destroyed by this disease?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.442
She said so many times.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.875
Is there any doubt in your mind that
Mrs Myerson wanted to end her life?

10:13.875 --> 10:16.997
None. She asked me to help her.
I said I couldn't legally.

10:16.997 --> 10:19.962
And that's when she turned
to her husband.

10:19.972 --> 10:21.221
Thank you.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.363
Helloooo…

10:44.051 --> 10:45.960
Whaddya think?

10:45.995 --> 10:47.878
I'm curious to your thoughts,

10:47.913 --> 10:51.228
if they involve me putting that on
in this life time…

10:51.263 --> 10:53.359
All the bridesmaids are wearing it.

10:53.359 --> 10:54.413
It's green.

10:54.448 --> 10:55.303
Yeah.

10:56.248 --> 11:00.070
Shirley, may we speak
as girlfriends for a second?

11:00.105 --> 11:02.176
I met you this morning.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.554
I know you're happy
for Ivan and me.

11:04.589 --> 11:06.783
But I don't want to be insensitive.

11:06.818 --> 11:09.961
If It's too difficult for you to be
giving him away at the ceremony…

11:09.961 --> 11:13.387
As long as were speaking as girlfriends:

11:13.422 --> 11:16.214
Aside from God and ‘Les Miserables’,

11:16.249 --> 11:19.006
how are you and Ivan… compatible?

11:19.040 --> 11:21.308
Well, we love children.

11:21.343 --> 11:23.119
I'm a wonderful housekeeper,

11:23.154 --> 11:27.588
I like to cook, these are
traditional values I speak of.

11:27.623 --> 11:32.701
I'm sexually very… indefatigable.

11:34.078 --> 11:38.837
Oh, God. Tsunami.
Holocaust. Trent Lott.

11:39.386 --> 11:41.903
Are you ah, are you one of those?

11:41.938 --> 11:43.223
Those?

11:43.257 --> 11:48.590
Those people who mock the religious
right or put down our administration.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.680
I would never…

12:15.198 --> 12:16.737
Who's dead?

12:16.772 --> 12:19.494
Nobody's dead, Rachel.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.051
I just came…

12:22.086 --> 12:24.220
to say hello.

12:24.255 --> 12:26.213
Is that it?

12:26.248 --> 12:28.137
Look, Rachel.

12:28.172 --> 12:31.932
Whatever damage… I'd like
to begin to repair it.

12:31.967 --> 12:36.016
Well, dad, I, I think we both can agree
we'd have to start with an apology.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.889
Where we differ is on
who needs to give it.

12:41.270 --> 12:45.242
I'm sorry that we lost track
for seven years.

12:45.277 --> 12:47.035
But I don't owe you an apology…

12:47.035 --> 12:48.081
See you, dad.

12:48.116 --> 12:52.752
Wait. Can we talk?

12:52.787 --> 12:53.749
I'm kinda busy.

12:53.784 --> 12:55.373
With what?

12:59.466 --> 13:00.946
Who is this?

13:02.605 --> 13:04.359
Your granddaughter.

13:15.830 --> 13:21.392
So far he's been paying child support,
so financially he's been responsible.

13:23.834 --> 13:27.339
How soon after did you split up?

13:27.832 --> 13:31.393
We were never together, dad.
It was one of those things.

13:32.819 --> 13:34.680
You're shocked.

13:35.212 --> 13:36.763
Rachel, you're almost forty.

13:36.763 --> 13:38.244
Meaning what, time to grow up?

13:38.244 --> 13:39.987
Meaning, perhaps when choosing men…

13:39.987 --> 13:42.027
Find one who won't walk out on me,

13:42.038 --> 13:44.135
yeah, well, you know what they say,

13:44.135 --> 13:45.935
girls looks to marry their fathers.

13:45.935 --> 13:47.700
I never walked out on your mother.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.046
No. But you walked out on me.

13:49.046 --> 13:50.525
I did not!

13:50.560 --> 13:51.970
You stole from me, I had no…

13:51.970 --> 13:53.423
Hey! She's three.

13:53.424 --> 13:55.704
She can understand what you're saying.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.168
Hello, sweetheart. You look…

14:08.207 --> 14:10.487
She just doesn't know you, that's all.

14:12.889 --> 14:15.454
How angry you must be with me.

14:15.489 --> 14:19.030
To not tell me…
that I had a granddaughter.

14:21.259 --> 14:24.277
How angry you must be.

14:33.107 --> 14:35.339
This district attorney
is not without talent.

14:35.339 --> 14:39.301
If he's able to present our client
in any unsympathetic light,

14:39.336 --> 14:41.053
we'll lose.

14:44.302 --> 14:46.027
You okay?

14:47.788 --> 14:52.106
I'm tired of my Alzheimer's
being a story point.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.504
This isn't your story, Denny.

14:54.539 --> 14:58.951
And your MRI was fine, remember?
No progression.

15:02.971 --> 15:09.003
Imagine killing somebody you deeply love.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.163
Even to spare suffering.

15:10.163 --> 15:12.412
You said you'd do it for me.

15:13.091 --> 15:15.098
You promised.

15:16.077 --> 15:18.400
I don't know that I could.

15:19.016 --> 15:23.200
Well, don't worry, you're off the hook.

15:23.608 --> 15:26.483
If the day comes,

15:26.518 --> 15:29.021
Bev said she'd sit on me.

15:29.056 --> 15:32.169
Ah! Boots on.

15:33.437 --> 15:36.360
That's what we did with my father.

15:42.535 --> 15:44.280
Morphine drip.

16:04.718 --> 16:09.843
She loved to read more than
anything else in the world.

16:10.980 --> 16:14.968
And in the last few months,
she couldn't even do that.

16:16.513 --> 16:19.374
What about the physical symptoms?

16:19.409 --> 16:24.268
Ah, well, her motor skills were declining,
which is why we hired the nurse.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.333
She battled incontinence.

16:26.368 --> 16:30.561
But mainly… it was the sense
that her brain was dying.

16:30.596 --> 16:32.606
And she knew it.

16:32.641 --> 16:39.111
I mean, this was a proud,
fiercely intelligent woman who…

16:39.146 --> 16:44.845
was becoming an imbecile, not only
in front everybody else's eyes.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.765
But her own.

16:49.056 --> 16:51.738
Were you present when she died?

16:52.417 --> 16:57.020
Yes. It, it was tragic.

16:57.524 --> 17:02.278
But it pales to the tragedy
had she gone on living.

17:12.469 --> 17:13.698
You practiced law together?

17:13.698 --> 17:14.881
My very first firm.

17:14.915 --> 17:16.723
Tiggs and Schmidt. It flopped.

17:16.758 --> 17:19.699
We were great partners,
but lousy partners.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.903
But boy, it was fun.

17:21.938 --> 17:23.414
Come on!

17:23.449 --> 17:24.891
Oh, God!

17:25.804 --> 17:27.847
Directions to the rehearsal dinner.

17:27.847 --> 17:31.055
Eight o'clock! You can bring a date!

17:34.207 --> 17:35.387
You think it's funny?

17:35.387 --> 17:36.537
I do.

17:36.925 --> 17:43.033
You're coming with me.
Eight o'clock! I can bring a date!

17:50.378 --> 17:53.647
Hellooo! time for my toast.

17:53.682 --> 17:55.332
Why am I here?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.265
Why am I?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.919
First, I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight…

18:01.220 --> 18:03.975
I have a confession to make.

18:04.010 --> 18:06.623
I never really thought I'd get married.

18:06.658 --> 18:09.202
I'd always hoped to, but… well…

18:09.237 --> 18:13.497
the thought that I'd actually meet
a man who could look past my various

18:13.508 --> 18:18.928
eccentricities and quirks
and see me for my heart.

18:18.963 --> 18:24.349
I never thought I'd actually
meet a man who…

18:26.093 --> 18:31.451
♫ Perhaps I had a wicked childhood ♫

18:31.486 --> 18:32.830
You have gotta be kidding.

18:32.830 --> 18:39.802
♫ Perhaps I had a miserable youth ♫

18:39.837 --> 18:44.930
♫ But somewhere in my wicked
miserable past ♫

18:44.965 --> 18:50.023
♫ There must have been
a moment of truth ♫

18:50.058 --> 18:52.621
–Am I being punked?
–Be nice.

18:52.656 --> 18:59.647
♫ For here you are
standing there loving me ♫

18:59.682 --> 19:05.831
♫ Whether or not you should ♫

19:05.866 --> 19:12.583
♫ So somewhere
in my youth or childhood ♫

19:12.618 --> 19:18.315
<i>♫ I must've done
something good. ♫</i>

19:18.350 --> 19:20.953
Come on, rehearsal dinners
are meant to be silly.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.522
Let me take you back
thirty years or so to ours.

19:23.522 --> 19:25.554
I don't relive past traumas.

19:25.589 --> 19:27.587
Then let me just take you back.

19:33.095 --> 19:35.340
Do you really love this girl, Ivan?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.551
Love is a state of mind, Shirley.

19:37.586 --> 19:40.520
No, it's not; maybe that's your problem:
you think.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.550
My problem is I love you.

19:46.232 --> 19:50.781
There, I said it. I love you.
Never stopped.

19:55.996 --> 19:58.115
This isn't fair, what
you're doing to this girl.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.975
I have enormous affection for her.

19:59.975 --> 20:02.352
The sex is rewarding.
I make her happy.

20:02.387 --> 20:05.072
All adds up to a workable equation.

20:05.107 --> 20:07.722
Your sense of romance is overwhelming.

20:07.757 --> 20:12.096
We always said what a mistake
it was for us to get married?

20:12.131 --> 20:14.915
Maybe the blunder was splitting up.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.652
Do you ever wonder?

20:22.777 --> 20:24.440
No.

20:27.873 --> 20:31.588
May I kiss the bride one last time
before the ceremony?

20:31.623 --> 20:37.224
I'm the best man. Very bad idea.

20:51.659 --> 20:53.862
Now that was romance.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.269
Yes, it was.

20:59.663 --> 21:01.836
Good night, Ivan.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.884
The thing is, dad,

22:08.919 --> 22:11.132
I can handle not knowing
whether you're in my life or not,

22:11.132 --> 22:14.869
but Fiona's asking me,
is Grandpa ever coming back?

22:14.904 --> 22:17.429
I gotta know what to tell her.

22:21.746 --> 22:24.913
Do you want me in your life?

22:26.183 --> 22:30.321
It's nice how you can put
accusations in question form.

22:30.455 --> 22:35.287
Let me try. Did you mean to suggest
our estrangement was my doing

22:35.322 --> 22:39.870
when it was you refusing to so much as take
my phone calls for three-plus years?

22:39.870 --> 22:41.575
How's that?

22:42.512 --> 22:45.659
Close that door.

22:50.081 --> 22:53.466
I heard you say that
she was emotionally unstable.

22:53.501 --> 22:58.156
Is it possible her decision was
influenced by this instability?

22:58.191 --> 22:59.904
No.

22:59.939 --> 23:01.582
No?

23:01.617 --> 23:04.790
Did you have a therapist
or any trained professional

23:04.825 --> 23:07.268
speak with her about
her apparent wish to die?

23:07.268 --> 23:11.911
I knew my wife better than
any therapist ever could,

23:11.946 --> 23:14.621
and her wish to die was not apparent.

23:14.656 --> 23:19.660
You, you stated that she was
becoming an imbecile.

23:19.695 --> 23:22.206
That must have been excruciating for you.

23:22.241 --> 23:27.039
Was it a relief in any way at all
when she died?

23:29.917 --> 23:34.517
It was a relief to see
her suffering end.

23:34.552 --> 23:39.082
I'm sorry to be asking these questions.

23:39.117 --> 23:43.376
It's just sometimes, in these situations
it's actually

23:43.411 --> 23:47.151
more about sparing the family's
suffering than it is the victims.

23:47.151 --> 23:48.347
Objection!

23:51.495 --> 23:53.432
The objection's overruled.

23:54.111 --> 23:55.969
Are you alright, Mr Crane?

24:02.720 --> 24:07.113
Sir, how much was it costing you
per month to care for your wife?

24:07.148 --> 24:10.284
You know, I, I'm just about one second away
from taking a fist to your head.

24:10.284 --> 24:11.586
Mr Myerson!

24:11.621 --> 24:14.973
That strikes me as impulsive.
Are you an impulsive person?

24:14.973 --> 24:17.110
Your Honor, this badgering
has gone on long enough.

24:17.110 --> 24:21.363
I am simply trying to establish that
Mr Myerson and the deceased

24:21.398 --> 24:25.617
were the two most emotionally
disabled people in all of this,

24:25.652 --> 24:28.531
the very last two people
who should be entrusted

24:28.538 --> 24:31.373
to make a decision to end human life.

24:45.616 --> 24:48.415
I'm sorry. I lost a crown
on my tooth last night;

24:48.415 --> 24:51.179
I was wondering whether perhaps
you swallowed it.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.549
Aren't you ashamed
of what… happened?

24:53.584 --> 24:55.918
No, but I can see you are,
so we're covered.

24:55.918 --> 24:59.600
Ivan! You are getting married,
and you're kissing another woman!

24:59.600 --> 25:01.888
Not just any woman. I promise.

25:01.923 --> 25:04.219
You simply cannot marry
this girl, not if…

25:04.219 --> 25:05.923
Theres only one thing that can stop it.

25:05.923 --> 25:07.656
And that is?

25:07.691 --> 25:10.458
I'm lookin at her.

25:11.670 --> 25:15.268
Final offer. Marry me.

25:17.998 --> 25:19.984
You're out of your mind.

25:21.486 --> 25:22.588
You didn't say ‘No’.

25:22.588 --> 25:22.954
No.

25:22.989 --> 25:23.673
You didn't mean ‘No’.

25:23.673 --> 25:25.091
‘No’ means ‘No’.

25:25.092 --> 25:27.100
If not you, then her.

25:27.854 --> 25:32.527
For God's sake, Ivan, think of her.

25:35.662 --> 25:38.856
See you at the ceremony, Shirl.

25:47.009 --> 25:49.241
I was not going to enable you any longer!

25:49.241 --> 25:51.147
So you stopped giving me money,

25:51.182 --> 25:54.220
but to walk out, to refuse to take my calls,

25:54.255 --> 25:56.852
to tell security at your damn firm
not to let me in?!

25:56.852 --> 25:59.380
If you think you're going
to lay all this on me…

25:59.380 --> 26:00.318
I gave you everything!

26:00.318 --> 26:02.302
It was your job to give me everything!

26:02.302 --> 26:05.073
Just like it's my job to give Fionna
everything, no matter what!

26:05.073 --> 26:07.995
–At some point…
–I needed you!

26:16.043 --> 26:21.918
For God's sake, dad, I was
a drug addict, an alcoholic…

26:22.429 --> 26:28.194
I had nothing. I needed my father.
And you abandoned me.

26:29.580 --> 26:32.188
You think that was easy for me?

26:32.223 --> 26:34.432
I spoke to counselors, professionals.

26:34.432 --> 26:37.512
They all told me you had
to hit bottom before…

26:37.547 --> 26:40.592
Well, mission accomplished, dad.
Because I did.

26:46.883 --> 26:49.687
In my darkest days…

26:49.722 --> 26:52.668
during your mother's illness,

26:52.703 --> 26:58.199
I would let my mind wander to you.

26:58.234 --> 27:01.761
I would dream… of being there for you

27:01.796 --> 27:06.115
when you give birth
to our first grandchild.

27:06.150 --> 27:10.244
Getting to hold and love

27:10.279 --> 27:15.263
a baby again, like I did you.

27:16.001 --> 27:21.123
How dare you take that away
from me? How dare you?

27:22.778 --> 27:28.045
Well you know what, dad?
In my darkest days…

27:28.080 --> 27:34.003
through it all… I had one little thing,
one tiny semblance of a foundation.

27:34.038 --> 27:37.228
It was knowing that no matter what,

27:37.229 --> 27:39.943
my father would be there for me.

27:41.438 --> 27:43.154
And he wasn't.

27:43.848 --> 27:45.705
He wasn't.

27:49.051 --> 27:52.875
How dare you take that from me?

28:19.591 --> 28:22.879
Shall we request that other song?

28:23.354 --> 28:27.503
For my money, she probably did
hit bottom because you walked away

28:27.538 --> 28:32.349
and that maybe saved
her life. Forgive her.

28:33.428 --> 28:36.603
I'm not sure she'll forgive me.

28:36.637 --> 28:41.582
Paul. You went to her house,
today she came to your office.

28:41.617 --> 28:43.680
You two are already back together,

28:43.715 --> 28:48.175
you just can't figure out a way
to execute the deal.

28:49.005 --> 28:51.134
And what about you and Ivan?

28:51.169 --> 28:52.163
I'm sorry?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.583
Do you still love him?

28:53.618 --> 28:54.968
I beg your pardon?

28:55.365 --> 28:57.734
Your taste in men, Shirley.

28:57.769 --> 29:04.208
Ivan Tiggs. Denny Crane,
wild, bigger than life.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.598
I, I don't love Ivan anymore.

29:06.633 --> 29:11.552
I'm just his best man.

29:17.937 --> 29:22.998
We have a law against assisted suicide.

29:24.509 --> 29:30.570
One reason simply goes
to the sanctity of life.

29:30.605 --> 29:33.641
Once we start eroding that?

29:33.676 --> 29:37.514
Once we say It's acceptable for people
to start killing themselves?

29:37.514 --> 29:40.254
A terrible thing happens.

29:40.476 --> 29:42.848
It becomes acceptable.

29:42.883 --> 29:45.185
It's suddenly an option.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.241
For the senior citizens with Alzheimer's,

29:48.276 --> 29:51.190
for the fifty-year-old with cancer,

29:51.225 --> 29:54.069
for the teenager with no friends.

29:54.104 --> 29:59.125
Who decides when suicide is the way to go?

29:59.160 --> 30:03.275
In this case the decision fell
to a mentally impaired woman

30:03.310 --> 30:05.923
and her emotionally despairing husband.

30:05.958 --> 30:10.044
Not exactly bastions of sound judgment.

30:10.079 --> 30:13.504
His motives, however clouded by grief,
may have been pure.

30:13.504 --> 30:17.097
But what about that husband
who wants his wife to die

30:17.132 --> 30:22.456
to perhaps prevent the estate
from being financially drained.

30:22.491 --> 30:26.296
What about the family who actually
seeks to end their own suffering,

30:26.296 --> 30:30.440
because it's too horrible watching
mom deteriorate?

30:30.475 --> 30:35.088
How do we assess or regulate motive?

30:35.123 --> 30:36.449
It's why we choose,

30:36.484 --> 30:41.053
as a matter of law
not to go down that slope.

30:41.614 --> 30:46.573
Nobody is arguing that Mr Myerson
is a bad man.  He isn't.

30:46.608 --> 30:50.176
But he admittedly, reflectively

30:50.211 --> 30:55.344
acted to end the life of a human being.

30:55.379 --> 30:59.541
Under the law which you took
an oath to uphold,

30:59.576 --> 31:02.025
that's murder.

31:17.215 --> 31:23.309
The dirty little secret is we went down
that slope years ago.

31:23.344 --> 31:27.686
Officially we say we're
against assisted suicide,

31:27.721 --> 31:31.531
but it goes on all the time.

31:31.566 --> 31:36.067
Seventy percent of all deaths
in hospitals are due to decisions

31:36.102 --> 31:38.103
to let patients die.

31:38.138 --> 31:41.989
Whether It's morphine drips
or respirators or hydration tubes.

31:42.024 --> 31:44.643
With all due respect
to the Terry Shivo fanfare,

31:44.643 --> 31:50.500
patients are assisted with death
all across this country all the time.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.409
As for regulating motive?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.734
Here's a thought. Investigate it.

31:54.769 --> 31:57.289
If we suspect foul play,
have the police ask questions,

31:57.289 --> 32:00.807
if it smells funny, prosecute.

32:00.842 --> 32:04.291
But here, there's no suggestion

32:04.326 --> 32:10.078
the Mr Myerson's motive was anything
other than to satisfy his wife's wishes

32:10.113 --> 32:15.831
and spare her the extreme indignity
of experiencing the rotting of her brain.

32:15.866 --> 32:18.532
Can you imagine?

32:19.214 --> 32:23.187
Would you want to live like that?

32:28.439 --> 32:32.652
I had a dog for twelve years.
His name was Alan.

32:32.687 --> 32:37.699
That was his name when I got him.

32:37.734 --> 32:39.601
He had cancer in the end.

32:39.636 --> 32:43.441
That, in conjunction
with severe hip dysplasia.

32:43.476 --> 32:45.981
And he was in unbearable pain.

32:46.016 --> 32:49.766
My vet recommended, and I agreed,
to euthanize him.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.002
It was humane.

32:52.037 --> 32:58.275
Which we, as a society,
endeavor to be, for animals.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.784
My client's act was humane.

33:02.803 --> 33:08.537
It was a selfless one,
it was a sorrowful one.

33:10.128 --> 33:12.814
Ms Myerson's nurse testified

33:12.849 --> 33:17.888
as to the profound love
Ryan Myerson had for his wife.

33:17.923 --> 33:22.927
Sometimes the ultimate act
of love… and kindness…

33:33.438 --> 33:37.583
If you think this man is a criminal,
send him to jail.

33:38.670 --> 33:43.403
But if you don't… don't.

34:07.721 --> 34:11.257
And do you, Missy, take Ivan to be
your lawfully-wedded husband,

34:11.257 --> 34:13.701
to love, honor, and obey,
till death do you part?

34:13.701 --> 34:16.088
I do. I do!

34:16.123 --> 34:18.848
And do you, Ivan, take Missy
to be your lawfully-wedded wife,

34:18.848 --> 34:22.795
to love, honor, and obey,
till death do you part?

34:22.831 --> 34:23.982
I do.

34:24.016 --> 34:25.945
If there's anyone who knows a reason

34:25.945 --> 34:28.826
why these two should not be joined
together in holy matrimony,

34:28.826 --> 34:32.092
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.385
The rings…

34:48.034 --> 34:55.150
♫ So somewhere in my youth
or childhood ♫

34:55.186 --> 35:00.337
♫ I must've done
something good ♫

35:02.138 --> 35:05.488
♫ Nothing comes from nothing ♫

35:05.523 --> 35:08.515
♫ Nothing ever could ♫

35:08.550 --> 35:12.821
♬ So somewhere in my youth
or childhood ♬

35:14.285 --> 35:17.092
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

35:17.127 --> 35:24.649
♬ I must have done
something good ♬

35:29.113 --> 35:33.027
I present to you…
Mr and Mrs Ivan Tiggs.

37:01.446 --> 37:03.572
Will the defendant please rise?

37:06.212 --> 37:09.613
Madame Foreperson, the jury
has reached a unanimous verdict?

37:09.613 --> 37:10.740
We have, Your Honor.

37:10.740 --> 37:11.711
What say you?

37:11.746 --> 37:14.580
In the matter of
the Commonwealth vs Ryan Myerson

37:14.580 --> 37:17.969
on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

37:18.004 --> 37:21.358
we the jury find the defendant,
Ryan Myerson…

37:21.393 --> 37:23.457
not guilty.

37:24.588 --> 37:25.840
Really?

37:25.875 --> 37:27.377
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,..

37:27.377 --> 37:29.597
Thank you so much, Mr Shore.

37:29.601 --> 37:32.335
It was nothing. But expensive.

37:32.335 --> 37:35.636
Denny? Thank you.

38:01.015 --> 38:03.724
I'm so overwhelmed,
I don't know what to say.

38:03.759 --> 38:07.333
There's typically a post verdict
crash, Mr Meyerson.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.907
I frequently counsel my clients
not to be alone.

38:11.893 --> 38:16.516
Do you have someone
to keep you company tonight?

38:29.192 --> 38:30.701
The nurse?

38:32.994 --> 38:35.532
The look was unmistakable.

38:36.341 --> 38:40.623
That's why he was so adamant about
going forward with the trial so fast.

38:40.623 --> 38:42.219
If his affair with the nurse surfaced,

38:42.219 --> 38:45.251
which it inevitably would have,
he'd be sunk.

38:45.286 --> 38:46.445
Huh.

38:47.446 --> 38:51.117
He killed her to be with his mistress.

38:52.220 --> 38:53.942
Who knows?

38:54.946 --> 38:58.260
Maybe the fact he was in love
with someone else made it easier

38:58.260 --> 39:00.705
to comply with his wife's desire to die.

39:00.740 --> 39:04.760
Maybe she didn't really want to die.
All we had was his word for it.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.531
And the nurse's.

39:06.566 --> 39:08.568
Oh, my God.

39:08.603 --> 39:12.438
We don't know whether he's innocent
or guilty.  I hate that!

39:13.982 --> 39:17.780
Denny, when you launched yourself
in court like a pop tart…

39:17.815 --> 39:20.174
He was badgering our client.

39:20.209 --> 39:22.293
I had to break the flow.

39:24.242 --> 39:27.198
Mr Koupfer had just said,

39:27.233 --> 39:31.584
families often act to end
their own suffering.

39:32.855 --> 39:35.816
Is that what happened
with your father?

39:45.861 --> 39:50.026
He wasn't exactly in pain.
His appetite was good.

39:50.061 --> 39:55.318
In fact he was actually smiling
more in the end then he…

39:58.535 --> 40:01.384
On the day,

40:01.419 --> 40:08.030
the day we told the doctor
to up the drip, he was blissful.

40:10.169 --> 40:14.697
We put him out of our misery.

40:15.644 --> 40:17.143
And I often wondered

40:17.365 --> 40:20.840
did that life belong to the man
with the brain of a two-year-old?

40:20.840 --> 40:23.367
Or to the man that preceded it?

40:23.402 --> 40:25.329
It certainly…

40:29.907 --> 40:32.541
didn't belong to me.

40:33.614 --> 40:37.774
I think the life belonged to the man
who preceded the disease.

40:37.863 --> 40:39.831
The man you knew as your father.

40:39.866 --> 40:41.266
Ah.

40:43.657 --> 40:46.325
But at what point?

40:47.918 --> 40:51.193
Koupfer said it was a slippery slurp

40:51.228 --> 40:53.248
Slope.

40:54.432 --> 40:57.650
How'd you get the doctor to do it?

41:00.131 --> 41:06.102
Denny Crane. I was still
the real thing then.

41:12.788 --> 41:14.555
Denny, I'm gonna say this right now

41:14.555 --> 41:17.161
and then I'm going to memorialize it
in my living will.

41:17.161 --> 41:19.282
If I ever end up with the mind
of a two-year-old…

41:19.282 --> 41:21.445
I'll have Bev sit on you.

41:23.786 --> 41:26.127
That's a load off.

41:33.652 --> 41:38.069
My day is coming, Alan.
We both know that.

41:38.633 --> 41:41.208
It's a long ways off.

41:43.528 --> 41:45.684
And in the meantime…

41:45.719 --> 41:52.526
Live big, my friend. Live big.
