[man] Previously on Lost:

00:03.921 --> 00:06.003
We're gonna have to take the boy.

00:06.090 --> 00:10.880
- Dad!
- Walt, no!

00:11.929 --> 00:13.510
I'm going after my son.

00:13.598 --> 00:16.635
I'm going after my son and nobody
is going to stop me.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.924
We need him!

00:21.689 --> 00:24.101
One of our people was captured by yours.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.524
- So go get him back.
- We can't do that.

00:26.611 --> 00:27.896
But you can.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.729
If you do, we'll let you
and Walt go free.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.365
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.159
I'll kill him.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.457
Michael?

00:48.591 --> 00:50.502
[Ben] You lived up to your word.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.339
We live up to our word too.

00:54.430 --> 00:58.719
You're gonna take this boat
and follow a compass bearing of 325.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.518
And if you do that exactly,
you and your son will find rescue.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.233
Who are you people?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.726
We're the good guys, Michael.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.782
- Walt!
- Dad!

01:14.200 --> 01:16.316
Come here. Come here.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.554
[cooing]

01:56.534 --> 01:59.150
- [approaching footsteps]
- [door opens]

02:07.211 --> 02:09.122
Thank you all for your patience.

02:13.926 --> 02:17.839
I know it's taken me a few days
to... figure out our next move.

02:17.930 --> 02:21.422
I didn't want to do anything until
I knew more about our situation.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.475
You deserve to know
everything that I do.

02:24.562 --> 02:27.929
80... no more secrets.

02:30.234 --> 02:34.147
As you all know, Miles here
and three of his people

02:34.238 --> 02:37.321
came to the island about a week ago.

02:37.408 --> 02:42.072
So I brought him up from the boathouse
to share with us

02:42.163 --> 02:44.654
exactly why they're here.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.374
We're here for him.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.621
We kinda, like, knew that forever ago.

02:53.716 --> 02:57.004
All right, then. Problem solved.
How soon do we turn him over?

02:57.094 --> 02:59.961
- We can't turn him over.
- Why the hell not?

03:00.056 --> 03:04.516
Because, once they have me, their orders
are to kill everyone else on the island.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.103
Wait, so, what, he's one of us now?

03:13.194 --> 03:16.357
You're gonna protect him?
He tried to kill you, John.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.733
He won't tell us
who his spy on the boat is.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.985
lt's Michael.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.318
What?

03:23.913 --> 03:26.245
My spy on the freighter is Michael.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.908
I'm sorry.

03:30.002 --> 03:34.962
The same guy that killed two women
in cold blood to set this bastard free,

03:35.049 --> 03:38.212
then sold us out so he could
get off the island? That Michael?

03:38.302 --> 03:39.462
Yes, James.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.047
That Michael.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.146
[alarm blares]

04:08.499 --> 04:11.241
The rules of desertion

04:11.335 --> 04:13.326
still apply to everyone.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.336
Nobody leaves this ship
without my say-so!

04:23.305 --> 04:25.842
I'm not beating these men to scare you.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.470
I beat them to save your lives.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.433
Remember what happened
to the last two men who took this boat?

04:32.523 --> 04:35.606
Remember what happened
to Minkowski?

04:35.693 --> 04:39.481
As soon as we get the engines fixed,
we're back in the hunt.

04:40.239 --> 04:44.403
In the meantime,
everybody, just hold on!

04:47.204 --> 04:49.365
-Johnson!
- Yes, sir?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.535
Clean this mess up.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.750
Yes, sir.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.799
- Hello, Michael.
- Not now, man.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.259
Yes, right now.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.813
Why are you on this boat?

05:19.195 --> 05:21.231
I'm here to die.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.937
Hey.

05:55.272 --> 05:59.766
That was a nice meetin', but thought
there weren't gonna be any more secrets.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.693
- What are you talking about?
- The three million bucks

06:02.780 --> 06:05.738
your buddy here asked for.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.735
Well?

06:07.826 --> 06:12.115
Yeah, Miles offered his loyalty
in exchange for the money.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.790
As I haven't seen a bank on the island,
I didn't think it worth mentioning.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.037
[laughter]

06:18.128 --> 06:19.413
Something funny?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.789
Linus will find a way to get it.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.508
And how will he do that?

06:28.472 --> 06:30.133
He wants to survive.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.342
And considering a week ago
you had a gun to his head

06:34.436 --> 06:37.564
and tonight he's eating pound cake,

06:37.648 --> 06:39.934
I'd say he's a guy gets what he wants.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.196
[people chattering]

06:47.283 --> 06:49.114
OK, thanks.

06:49.702 --> 06:51.112
Bye, guys.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.488
Bye.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.078
[Ben] Alex.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.664
May l have a word with you?

06:58.794 --> 07:01.035
We've heard enough
from you for one night.

07:01.130 --> 07:04.839
- Sorry. Just listen to a little more.
- It's OK.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.632
What do you want?

07:09.555 --> 07:12.092
This is a map to the temple.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.718
It's a sanctuary.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.391
It may be the last safe place
on this island.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.766
- How come we don't know?
- Wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told.

07:21.150 --> 07:25.109
The rest of our people are there. Leave
now, get there in a day and a half.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.278
If it's safe, why don't we all go?
Hurley, Claire, the baby?

07:28.365 --> 07:31.732
Because the temple's not for them,
Karl. It's only for us.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.614
These people that are coming
know who I am, Alex.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.368
They're here to capture me and
kill anybody that gets in their way.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.246
If they knew who you were,
that you are my daughter,

07:41.337 --> 07:44.170
they would use you to get to me.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.542
We don't have much time.

07:48.344 --> 07:49.379
Maybe he's right.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.057
I agree. We should go.

07:59.438 --> 08:02.805
These people,
you said they're dangerous.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.062
More dangerous than you?

08:10.699 --> 08:12.030
Yes.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.369
But your mother will protect you.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.033
OK, now go.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.805
- Where is he?
- Engine room.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.057
- You sure?
- Yeah.

08:45.401 --> 08:46.732
He's in the engine room.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.232
[groaning]

08:54.326 --> 08:56.863
I don't understand it.
It should be working.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.202
Gaskets are all corroded.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.867
Can I help you?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.258
Oh, thanks. We're OK.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.341
Jeff, you know what?
We need a pressure valve.

09:16.432 --> 09:19.048
You mind grabbing one
from the supply room?

09:19.143 --> 09:20.883
Not at all.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.896
You shouldn't be here.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.941
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

09:30.028 --> 09:33.065
If they see me talk to you...
You won't understand!

09:33.157 --> 09:37.366
l'll understand perfectly, Michael.
You just start from the beginning

09:37.453 --> 09:40.661
and explain how you came to be
on this boat.

What happened to me?

You were in a car accident.
It's a miracle you're alive.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.548
- How badly am I hurt?
- Shh.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.676
You just need to rest now.

It's a cold night.

I thought I heard someone shout,

13:09.373 --> 13:11.614
and something tells me it wasn't him.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.868
You OK?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.751
You are lucky to be alive.

EMT say they found you in a wrecked car
with a note pinned to your chest.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.680
You didn't have any ID on you.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.846
You want to tell me your name?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.635
Yeah, I didn't think so.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.220
You want me to call Walt?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.355
- What?
- The note pinned to your chest.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.438
It was written to Walt.
You want me to call him?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.319
No.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.330
OK, then.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.482
Hey, Ma.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.070
Can I come in?

14:26.783 --> 14:29.616
- No. You know the answer to that.
- I want to see him.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.113
- No.
- Just let me talk...

14:31.204 --> 14:33.160
I don't know what you said to that boy,

14:33.248 --> 14:36.115
but whatever it was
he doesn't want to see you.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.292
Please, Ma. He's my son.
I have a right...

14:39.379 --> 14:40.960

about you or Walt,

14:51.892 --> 14:54.679

it's gonna be OK.

- I'm not looking for money.

- What are you looking for?
- I want a gun.

We're the ones
who sent you home, Michael.

we weren't gonna keep tabs?

- Your help.

Why would I help the son of a bitch
who kidnapped my son?

18:42.372 --> 18:46.365
We gave him back to you in one piece,
Mike. You're the one who lost him.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.627
You told him, didn't you?

18:57.804 --> 19:01.672
You couldn't carry the guilt of what
you did to those two women by yourself

19:01.766 --> 19:04.098
so you shared it
with a ten-year-old kid?

19:05.395 --> 19:07.852
Is that why you want to kill yourself?

19:07.939 --> 19:09.975
Because that's how
he looks at you now?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.648
- He knows you're a murderer?
- Go away!

19:12.736 --> 19:17.105
I got some bad news for you, you can't
kill yourself. The island won't let you.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.113
- What'd you say?
- No matter how bad you want to,

19:23.204 --> 19:25.991
no matter how many
different ways you try,

19:26.082 --> 19:27.743
it won't happen.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.584
Give it a shot if you don't believe me.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.217
You got more work to do, Mike.

welcome to your host...

20:07.290 --> 20:09.201
[moans]

20:10.460 --> 20:12.200
[gun clicks, doesn't fire]

20:12.295 --> 20:15.628
- [be/l dings on TV]
- [woman on TV] Is it Kurt Vonnegut?

20:15.715 --> 20:19.378
[man] Right! And to triple
your points for next round,

20:19.469 --> 20:22.632
can you give us the name
of the book’s protagonist?

20:22.722 --> 20:26.180
[man #2] We interrupt this program
for a news bulletin.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.805
[woman] The wreckage of Oceanic flight
815 has been found.

20:30.939 --> 20:35.308
This footage conﬁrms that the airplane
did, in fact, crash at sea.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.400
At these tremendous depths,

20:37.487 --> 20:40.194
there is little hope of recovering
any remains.

20:40.281 --> 20:44.115
Investigators are equally skeptical
about the chances of retrieving

20:44.202 --> 20:46.693
Oceanic 815’s black box.

20:46.788 --> 20:50.201
The real story behind what happened
to this fateful airliner

20:50.291 --> 20:54.500
may have been lost, along
with the 324 passengers onboard.

20:55.004 --> 20:59.839
But even with this tragic discovery,
the victims’ families...

21:04.556 --> 21:07.013
I didn't expect you that fast.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.393
[Mr. Friendly chuckling]

21:14.107 --> 21:16.849
This the guy who hit you
with the champagne bottle?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.104
Yeah, but I had it coming.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.356
- [Mr. Friendly chuckles]
- [glasses clink]

21:21.448 --> 21:24.440
Arturo, Michael and l have some
business we have to attend to.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.025
- Would you get some air?
- Of course.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.361
Ciao.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.074
Help yourself to the chow.

21:34.169 --> 21:39.709
Don't make it to the mainland too often.
So when I do, I like to indulge myself.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.791
So you people can just... come and go?

21:42.886 --> 21:45.468
Some of us. You want a drink?

21:45.555 --> 21:49.548
What I want is for you to tell me why
my plane is at the bottom of the ocean.

21:50.185 --> 21:53.143
[chuckling] That's not your plane.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.560
It's a phony.

21:55.899 --> 21:59.437
A man named Widmore put it down there,
and he staged the whole wreck.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.109
Staged? Why would he stage...?

22:02.197 --> 22:06.031
Because he doesn't want anyone else
finding where the real plane ended up

22:06.117 --> 22:07.357
except for him.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.825
I'm supposed to believe this?

22:14.417 --> 22:19.252
Did the bullet bounce off your skull,
or did the gun just jam on you?

22:25.094 --> 22:27.506
- Prove it.
- Sorry?

22:27.597 --> 22:31.761
Prove that this guy Widmore
did what you say he did. Prove it.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.774
That's the cemetery in Thailand

22:45.865 --> 22:49.232
where Widmore dug up
the 300-odd corpses he needed.

22:49.327 --> 22:54.447
And the purchase order for the old 777
he bought through a shell company.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.873
The shipping logs
for the freighter he used

22:56.960 --> 22:59.576
to drop the whole mess
down a trench deep enough

22:59.671 --> 23:02.754
to guarantee that no remains
will ever be identified.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.674
Do you have any idea what it would cost
to bring those bodies up?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.802
What do you want from me, man?

23:12.141 --> 23:15.975
In a few days,
a freighter is porting in Fiji.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.428
lt's Widmore's boat.

23:18.523 --> 23:22.311
We have reason to believe he finally
found the coordinates of the island

23:22.402 --> 23:25.314
and he's heading for it.
Congratulations, Michael.

23:25.405 --> 23:29.614
Your shore leave is over.
You just got a job on that boat.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.074
Meet Kevin Johnson.

23:32.161 --> 23:35.324
You're joining the crew in Fiji
as a deck hand.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.830
You want me to go undercover?

23:43.006 --> 23:45.713
Why the hell would I go back to work
for you people?

23:45.800 --> 23:48.587
Because if Widmore finds the island,

23:48.678 --> 23:50.839
it's good night for everybody on it.

23:51.139 --> 23:54.222
He'll kill them all
without thinking twice.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.766
You want to redeem yourself
for what you did?

23:56.853 --> 24:00.391
This is your only chance.
You can save all their lives.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.101
No. I can't.

24:03.192 --> 24:07.026
- I can't go back to that island.
- I didn't say back to the island.

24:08.531 --> 24:12.365
You're not going on that boat
so you can swab decks, Michael.

24:13.745 --> 24:17.237
You're going so you can kill
everyone onboard.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.647
[horn honking]

24:50.073 --> 24:53.406
[truck beeping]

25:07.298 --> 25:08.959
[man] Hey.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.091
You our engineer?

25:13.221 --> 25:16.179
No. Just a deck hand.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.392
Well, we're all equals on this boat.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.430
As long as you play decent hold 'em.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.228
George... Minkowski.

25:24.774 --> 25:25.980
Kevin Johnson.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.557
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.610
Why don't you go check in
with Naomi over there, and...

25:30.697 --> 25:32.187
...l'll be seeing you.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.441
Welcome.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.194
No. You're good to go. Thanks.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.369
Uh...

25:40.873 --> 25:43.489
l'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.286
Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure.

25:49.132 --> 25:51.965
- So you're from the States, yeah?
- New York.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.258
I could tell from the accent.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.257
- Manchester?
- How'd you guess?

25:57.348 --> 25:59.009
You can head onboard.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.558
Oh, one of these crates
was delivered for you.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.977
I'll have it delivered to your berth?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.730
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Welcome aboard, Kevin.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.484
Your name isn't Kevin.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.498
Don't worry.

26:26.586 --> 26:30.420
Eighty percent of the people on
this boat are lying about something.

26:30.506 --> 26:34.044
- Orange?
- No, thanks.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.596
[cell phone rings]

26:41.684 --> 26:44.050
- Yeah?
- [Mr Friend/y] How was your trip?

26:44.145 --> 26:46.761
I figure flying can't be
too much fun for you.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.392
What do you want?

26:48.483 --> 26:52.021
- You get your care package?
- Yeah.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.854
Wait a day or two until you're out in
the open sea, then you're good to go.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.114
Stow your gear downstairs, all right?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.278
Oh, you met some of them now.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.455
Got some names and faces
and you're getting cold feet.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.282
Yeah, actually, I am.

27:08.377 --> 27:12.336
Here are a few more names for you:
Sun, Sawyer, Jack,

27:12.423 --> 27:14.288
Claire, her baby.

27:14.383 --> 27:19.127
The only way you'll save their lives is
if you man up and get on that boat.

27:19.222 --> 27:22.180
Or maybe you want to come back
and explain to your kid

27:22.266 --> 27:25.053
how you let all them die too.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.723
lt's game time. Are you in or out?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.564
I'm in.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.569
Good. Ditch your phone
and go do yourjob.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.638
[man] l was flying these things
when you were in grade school.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.265
Anybody goes first, should be me.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.221
I need you to transport
the science team.

28:12.316 --> 28:16.605
- What the hell will you be doing?
- That's need-to-know. You don't.

28:28.291 --> 28:31.328
So much for the fairer sex, huh?

28:32.420 --> 28:34.456
[chuckling]

28:34.547 --> 28:35.878
Frank Lapidus.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.546
Chopper pilot.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.419
Kevin Johnson.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.334
Deck hand.

28:43.890 --> 28:47.132
- So, what's your story, Kevin?
- Sorry?

28:48.102 --> 28:50.093
How'd you end up on this tub?

28:52.690 --> 28:56.649
- Looking for a little adventure.
- Ah, adventure.

28:57.236 --> 29:02.606
Yeah. Well, how do you like this
for adventure?

29:03.326 --> 29:05.988
You ever hear about Oceanic 815?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.035
Yeah.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.498
What would you say if I told you
the plane they found in that trench

29:16.589 --> 29:18.295
wasn't Oceanic 815.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.250
Then what is it?

29:23.346 --> 29:27.009
You know those nuts that think
the moon landing was faked?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.636
This is like that...

29:29.727 --> 29:31.217
...only real.

29:31.312 --> 29:33.428
That's why I signed up for this trip,

29:33.522 --> 29:37.515
because the owner of this boat
believes me. Charles Widmore.

29:38.235 --> 29:42.148
He believes that 815
is still out there somewhere.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.024
I mean, can you imagine
what would happen...

29:47.036 --> 29:49.869
...if we found
some of those people alive?

30:31.831 --> 30:33.162
[man] Pull!

30:33.249 --> 30:35.786
- [machine gunfire]
- [men cheering, laughing]

30:39.005 --> 30:40.711
Pull!

30:40.798 --> 30:44.086
[machine gunfire]

30:44.510 --> 30:45.716
Pull!

30:48.180 --> 30:50.592
- Another clip.
- [laughter]

30:52.351 --> 30:53.386
Pull!

30:56.856 --> 30:59.472
- Kill shot!
- [Michael] Hey.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.774
What are you guys doing?

31:04.030 --> 31:06.191
What's it look like we're doing?

31:06.282 --> 31:08.022
We're shooting things.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.197
Pull!

31:09.285 --> 31:11.947
- [machine gunfire]
- [laughter]

31:13.330 --> 31:17.573
l, uh... thought we were going
on a rescue mission.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.214
Uh...
Don't you have something to mop up?

31:25.301 --> 31:27.212
[cocks gun]

31:32.558 --> 31:34.469
[man] Come on, let's go.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.177
- Pull!
- [machine gunfire]

31:56.832 --> 31:59.824
- [man] Pull!
- [machine gunfire]

32:45.172 --> 32:47.914
You can do this.

32:48.008 --> 32:51.876
Seven-one-seven-seven-six.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.381
OK.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.096
OK.

33:01.147 --> 33:04.184
[J‘ It's Getting Better]

33:12.992 --> 33:14.983
Don't do it, Michael.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.395
[beeping]

33:53.115 --> 33:54.730
I love you, Walt.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.793
[pounding]

34:56.178 --> 34:58.385
What, are you going Nicholson on us?

34:58.472 --> 35:00.838
- What?
- Jack Nicholson in The Shining,

35:00.933 --> 35:04.096
when he's bouncing that ball
against the wall?

35:04.186 --> 35:07.428
Next thing you know you'll go
after your wife with an ax.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.013
I'm not married, man.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.768
Sorry to interrupt, but you got a call.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.990
- A call?
- Yeah. From the mainland.

35:17.074 --> 35:19.281
They patched it through
to the radio room.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.905
It's gotta be a mistake.
Nobody knows I'm here.

35:21.996 --> 35:25.830
You're the only Kevin Johnson on board,
so somebody knows you're here.

35:25.916 --> 35:29.534
Said he really needs to talk to you.
His name's Walt.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.429
Here you go.

35:39.513 --> 35:42.755
Hey, it's kind of personal.
Mind if I take this alone?

35:42.850 --> 35:45.262
Take your time, Kev.

35:45.352 --> 35:49.186
You just push this yellow button
and turn this knob on the console.

35:49.273 --> 35:50.979
- Got it.
- OK.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.404
[door shuts]

35:57.114 --> 35:58.650
Walt?

35:58.741 --> 36:01.653
[Ben] I’m so sorry, Michael,
but he's still in New York.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.908
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.583
Michael?

36:13.088 --> 36:14.464
Are you still there?

36:16.550 --> 36:19.007
You put me on this boat...

36:19.094 --> 36:22.382
...talk me into blowing it up,

36:22.473 --> 36:26.933
and when I push the damn button,
a flag pops up.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.344
You actually activated the bomb?

36:30.439 --> 36:32.100
It's not a bomb! It's a...

36:33.108 --> 36:34.223
It's a joke.

36:35.027 --> 36:38.064
There are people on your boat
who are innocent.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.860
They have no idea that the man
they work for is a monster.

36:42.409 --> 36:46.027
A killer without conscience
or a greater purpose.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.284
I had to show you the difference
between him and me.

36:50.376 --> 36:53.163
When I'm at war,
I'll do what I need to do to win,

36:53.253 --> 36:57.371
- but I will not kill innocent people.
- Ana Lucia and Libby?

36:57.466 --> 37:00.958
- They were innocent.
- You killed them, Michael.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.136
No one asked you to.

37:07.309 --> 37:11.018
I don't blame you, Michael.
We did have your boy.

37:11.105 --> 37:14.643
And what wouldn't a man do
for his son?

37:17.403 --> 37:20.145
What do you want from me?

37:21.990 --> 37:24.606
I want you to compile a list of names.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.151
Every person on your boat.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.579
When I call again,
you'll give me that list.

37:30.666 --> 37:34.409
Then you will disable the radio room
you're sitting in.

37:34.503 --> 37:37.620
When the crew is disoriented
by their lack of communication

37:37.714 --> 37:40.000
you'll take out the engines too.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.255
That way the boat
can never get to this island

37:44.346 --> 37:46.553
and your friends will be safe.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.432
Will you do that for me, Michael?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.111
Yeah.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.242
Then consider yourself
one of the good guys.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.814
So you're telling me...

38:40.277 --> 38:42.893
...that you're working
for Benjamin Linus?

38:49.495 --> 38:51.076
Yeah.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.618
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.752
[screams]

39:04.843 --> 39:06.253
Hey, Sayid.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.302
Hold it! Let me go!

39:09.389 --> 39:11.596
- What are you doing?
- Shut your mouth!

39:14.770 --> 39:17.182
What the hell is this?

39:17.272 --> 39:19.183
This man is not who you think he is.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.311
He was a passenger
on Oceanic flight 815.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.654
I spent two months with him
on the island

39:24.738 --> 39:26.603
before he betrayed us.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.531
This is the man who sabotaged
your radio room.

39:29.618 --> 39:33.531
He destroyed the ship's engine.
And his name isn't Kevin Johnson.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.784
lt's Michael Dawson...

39:38.043 --> 39:39.874
...and he's a traitor.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.097
We stop here and drink.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.648
Two minutes. Then we keep moving.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.837
What's wrong?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.505
Nothing.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.129
Karl.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.134
I don't know.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.430
| just have a bad feeling about this.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.850
What if your dad is playing us?

40:39.438 --> 40:44.023
Look, I don't like taking orders
from my dad any more than you do...

40:44.693 --> 40:47.105
...but I know he doesn't want me
to get hurt.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.938
At least we've got something in common.

40:53.076 --> 40:57.035
I promise not to tell if you won't.
[chuckles]

40:57.122 --> 41:00.159
[whizzing sounds]

41:02.169 --> 41:03.375
[gunshoﬂ

41:05.213 --> 41:07.204
Alex!

41:07.299 --> 41:09.210
- Karl. Karl!
- Alex!

41:10.218 --> 41:12.209
[crying] Karl, Karl. No!

41:12.304 --> 41:14.044
- Come on. Come on, he's gone.
- No!

41:15.057 --> 41:16.797
[gunfire]

41:16.892 --> 41:17.972
Duck!

41:19.561 --> 41:22.974
- No, we have to get Karl! Karl!
- He's gone, he's gone!

41:23.065 --> 41:25.932
Listen to me.
I need you to take my hand.

41:26.026 --> 41:28.392
On the count of three,
we're going to run.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.903
Can you do that with me?

41:33.158 --> 41:34.864
I love you.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.818
I love you very much, Alexandra.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.747
Are you ready?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.450
One, two...

41:49.758 --> 41:50.998
Three!

42:01.436 --> 42:04.428
[whimpering]

42:19.955 --> 42:22.697
Wait, wait, don't! l'm Ben's daughter!

42:22.791 --> 42:25.203
l'm his daughter!
