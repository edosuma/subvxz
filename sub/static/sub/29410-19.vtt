turned her life around,

is built on cruelty.

And a man we will
all stay away from.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.452
-I said stop.
-Fine with me.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.758
Should we play
highlights/lowlights?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.064
Oh, you loved that

11:57.107 --> 11:58.065
when you were kids.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.240
I'm sorry.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.328
I know this is a shock.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.459
But if Nicholas killed Eve...

12:01.503 --> 12:02.939
MARTIN:
Uh, one quibble there.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.854
He would never have
done that himself.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.161
Remember, murder's just

12:07.204 --> 12:10.077
another business transaction--
a task for a loyal employee.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.469
A contract killer.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.601
I'll find him.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.777
Force him to flip on Endicott.

12:14.821 --> 12:15.865
Flip on Endicott?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.475
Did you hear what I said?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.651
-He will destroy us all.
-[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

12:19.695 --> 12:20.870
Goodbye, Dr. Whitly.

12:20.914 --> 12:21.915
Malcolm...

12:21.958 --> 12:23.438
I forbid you from continuing

12:23.481 --> 12:25.005
this investigation.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.223
Malcolm Whitly,

12:26.267 --> 12:28.138
I am still your father!

12:28.182 --> 12:29.618
JESSICA:
Well...

12:29.661 --> 12:31.402
I'd say that was a lowlight.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.100
You slept with him, didn't you?

12:35.711 --> 12:37.800
Good thing you never say no.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
[scoffs]

12:51.248 --> 12:53.250
I've completed Eve's autopsy.

13:00.692 --> 13:01.868
Cause of death?

13:01.911 --> 13:03.695
She drowned.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.089
And there are
injuries consistent

13:06.133 --> 13:08.135
with hitting the water
from a significant height.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.708
But it wasn't a suicide.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.841
Drowning is a diagnosis
of exclusion,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.669
meaning I've ruled out
literally every other

13:20.712 --> 13:22.889
possible cause of death.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.369
So most pathologists would have
toed the company line

13:25.413 --> 13:27.502
and ruled it a suicide.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.546
The company line?

13:28.590 --> 13:29.547
I got a call from

13:29.591 --> 13:30.548
the commissioner's office.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.028
They were wondering why

13:32.072 --> 13:33.856
I haven't made my determination.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.553
That's Endicott at work.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.686
What did you tell them?

13:37.729 --> 13:39.166
Don't worry, I am not like

13:39.209 --> 13:40.907
most pathologists.
[short chuckle]

13:40.950 --> 13:41.908
That's for sure.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.823
When a person inhales water,

13:43.866 --> 13:46.869
diatoms--
a kind of microalgae--

13:46.913 --> 13:49.089
enters into the lungs,
then circulates

13:49.132 --> 13:50.655
through the organs.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.571
I extracted the diatoms
from Eve's bone marrow,

13:53.615 --> 13:55.791
examined them,
revealing a slightly

13:55.835 --> 13:57.358
different level of chlorophyll

13:57.401 --> 13:59.186
than in the sample
water from the river.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.363
-Meaning?
-Someone drowned her.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.321
And then threw her
off that bridge.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
Bright...

14:06.976 --> 14:10.023
Our first profile
is straightforward.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.852
Nicholas Endicott
is the sociopath puppet master.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.071
He's already proven he can
pull strings at the NYPD.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.465
We have no way of knowing
how far his reach extends.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.989
He's the killer
who doesn't kill.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.905
Eve's murderer is different.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.385
We're looking for an assassin.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.300
They're almost
impossible to profile.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.258
So...

14:28.302 --> 14:29.694
I don't have one.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.566

Oh.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.133

14:35.048 --> 14:36.832

I've closed up shop.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.647

Who was it?

16:06.748 --> 16:08.663
A woman.

Eve Blanchard.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.493
-Nice girl.
-That's a shame,

16:12.536 --> 16:13.885

-No.

She's famously skilled
at concealing her identity.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.612
Oh, cool. Should be easy then.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.092
Yeah, but we're not
looking for her.

We're looking

I liked him.

He was the first man
in a long time that I could...

20:42.676 --> 20:44.460
He was a widower.

Today I accepted.

You did it.
You got the guy that killed Eve.

38:48.413 --> 38:49.762
That matters.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.656
He doesn't matter.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.789
There's no profile.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.661
And he killed Eve
because it was his job.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.796
Endicott hired him to do it.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.016
He'll make a deal.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.714
That's not gonna happen.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.067
You're right.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.417
Where are you going?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.027
Bright.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.426
I'm with Major Crimes.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.428
Lieutenant Arroyo sent me.

39:47.472 --> 39:48.908
[medical monitor beeping]

39:48.951 --> 39:50.649
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

40:07.013 --> 40:08.101
Hello, Eddie.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.933
MARTIN: What do you mean
by "assurances"?

40:13.976 --> 40:15.761
You're already locked up,

40:15.804 --> 40:17.980
and this cell suits you,
for now.

40:18.024 --> 40:21.027
But what happens in ten years,
when you're a caged animal

40:21.070 --> 40:24.465
and when you go stir-crazy
and decide to burn it all down?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.032
We have a deal:

40:26.075 --> 40:29.470
mutual assurance or...

40:29.514 --> 40:31.429
mutual destruction.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.606
I need more.

40:34.649 --> 40:38.087
I take comfort
in a certain measure of control,

40:38.131 --> 40:40.133
and my business
provides it for me.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.179
What do you want?

40:43.223 --> 40:46.226
[chuckles]: I broke some laws,
just like you...

40:46.269 --> 40:50.143
but my business trades in
the science of the human body.

40:50.186 --> 40:53.668
It's helped me realize that
there's one form of leverage

40:53.712 --> 40:55.801
that trumps all the others.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.151
So I use it.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.154
Don't cross me, Martin.

41:01.197 --> 41:04.070
If you tell anyone
about Sophie Sanders,

41:04.113 --> 41:06.376
I will do more than destroy you,

41:06.420 --> 41:08.378
I will destroy
your entire family.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.945
Do not threaten my...

41:09.989 --> 41:12.861
I will bankrupt your estate,
ruin your children,

41:12.905 --> 41:15.560
and make love
to your beautiful wife.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.268
But it probably
won't come to that.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.531
And in the meantime,

41:30.575 --> 41:33.403
I'll make sure
you get a nice rug.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.709
Deal?

41:54.033 --> 41:55.077
[laughs]

41:56.949 --> 41:58.864
I can't do this anymore.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.441
I need you to go.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.272
I said go!

42:18.144 --> 42:20.799
[distorted banging]

42:22.365 --> 42:23.932
Whoa.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.718
Whoa. My name's Malcolm Bright.
I work with the NYPD.

42:29.677 --> 42:30.896
Gil.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.427
Eddie was killed
in the hospital.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.647
Edrisa found DNA on the body.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.301
Your DNA.

42:45.345 --> 42:47.303
Well, he was alive
when I went to question him.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.044
This was not
an accidental transfer.

42:49.088 --> 42:50.829
It was hair...

42:50.872 --> 42:52.526
skin cells
under the fingernails.

42:54.528 --> 42:55.964
Too much to ignore.

42:56.008 --> 42:58.097
That's impossible.

43:00.882 --> 43:02.492
I'm sorry.

43:02.536 --> 43:04.582
Gil, you...
you know I didn't do this.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.714
JT:
Malcolm Bright, you're
under arrest for murder.

43:41.575 --> 43:44.143
MAN:
Greg, move your head.
