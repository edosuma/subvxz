00:05.400 --> 00:06.970

I'm willing to disregard Rachel
and proceed with the treatment.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.970
They're not clone cells.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.246
They're from a totally different person.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.529
Whoever you cloned, do they have niece or even a daughter?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.767
I didn't think your mom had any sisters.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.650
They all look the same but I can tell them apart.

Well, I have to make these place settings for Family Day.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.647
I could use some help.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.848
I'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix

00:43.920 --> 00:45.524
but my charges go away and I'm done.

SARAH: <i>Six scientists incinerated
in a lab explosion.</i>

00:48.800 --> 00:50.609
Susan and Ethan Duncan.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.091
They were Rachel's parents, then?

00:52.160 --> 00:55.004
If you think you're gonna take Duncan
back, then you'll have to kill us both.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.889
Leekie wouldn't let us raise her.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.242
He killed Rachel's mother!

01:03.400 --> 01:05.880
ALISON: Well, my neighbour Aynsley
always thought she was better than me.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.360
Yeah, it's tough the judgment.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.687
Yes, and it wasn't, you know, outright.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.730
It was just these little jabs and looks.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.121
- I hate people like that.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.680
I guess, you know, in that sense, she had it coming.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.441
Had what coming?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.288
Oh, just, just an incident.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.401
Come on, Ali, unburden yourself.
That's why we're here.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.130
Mmm, no, I can't.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.090
Hey, look at me.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.171
You can trust me.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.966
There's stuff that I've done.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.447
No judgment.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.408
I slept with her husband, in a parking lot.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.610
- Do you think I'm awful?
- No.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.682
- No?
- I think you're brave.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.521
Alison, you're brave for sharing.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.409
- Feels nice, feels good, no?
- Yeah.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.522
You know the next step is you have to learn to forgive...

02:03.600 --> 02:04.681
And then I killed her.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.167
Well, she was choking and I didn't stop it.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.844
- What, like on a piece of chicken?
- No.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.285
Not like on a piece of chicken.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.244
I could have saved her and I didn't.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.484
She clawed at the counter-top,

02:22.720 --> 02:23.926
begging for her life.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.607
I stood there,

02:27.880 --> 02:29.166
until it was over.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.841
(EXHALES)

02:35.760 --> 02:39.128

It feels so good to say it out loud.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.441
Yeah, I bet.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.045
You have been so supportive.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.847
I made something.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.446
Oh, it's for me?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.680
Yeah, who else?

02:56.520 --> 02:57.567
(RETCHING)

03:02.760 --> 03:05.047
Hey, Mr Duncan,

03:05.640 --> 03:06.687
is this it?

03:08.360 --> 03:11.728
No, no, I told you. Red box, no label.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.204
We simply cannot leave without it.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.885
He's mad, Siobhan.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.485
He's afraid we'll side with Leekie.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.607
(EXHALES)

03:21.960 --> 03:23.325
Maybe we side with Rachel.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.526
After what she's done?

03:24.680 --> 03:26.205
Rachel is a creature of Dyad.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.203
She may know full well that Leekie killed her mother,

03:28.280 --> 03:29.327
she might even approve.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.130
No, she had those videos of them.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.281
It doesn't mean anything.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.283
Well, I don't know how we use him yet,

03:35.200 --> 03:38.044
but I say, we divide and conquer.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.330
That's a good enough strategy, isn't it?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.290
- Might be, with more facts.
- ETHAN: Aha.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.887

This is my lab,

14:06.680 --> 14:07.761
my body!

14:08.000 --> 14:10.002
I'm the science. Get out!

14:14.440 --> 14:16.647
(SNIFFLING)

14:29.880 --> 14:31.325
Whoa! Hi!

14:31.400 --> 14:33.448
Hi, could I talk to you for a second?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.570
(EXHALES)
Yeah, sure, what's up?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.047
Privately.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.723
- Hey, Ali, you ready for Family Day?
- Absolutely.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.641
Mmm-hmm.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.130
So what's on your mind?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.210
You selfish, manure bag of a man.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.928
- What's this?
- You are supposed to come to rehab

14:54.000 --> 14:55.604
to heal and to grow.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.001
You're not supposed to come to get even sleazier.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.560
I opened up to you, Vic. I trusted you.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.483
Alison, I'm honestly sorry.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.883
I got a pass, I'm trying to get out from under.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.969
I have to meet DeAngelis this afternoon.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.725
And what would your dealer friends say about squeally Vic?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.451
I'm moving forward and if you knew what
was good for you, you'd do the same.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.243
Starting by removing the unsavoury
elements from your life.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.010
Sarah's not pleased.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.124
- Sarah?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.326
VIC: Is she here?

15:27.680 --> 15:28.727
She's nearby.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.961
- Aldous?
- Marion.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.527
(LAUGHING)

15:44.160 --> 15:45.605
Oh, please, tell me

15:45.680 --> 15:49.241
your hands have not been soaking in
some gruesomely fecund jelly.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.446
(LAUGHING)

15:50.520 --> 15:52.887
What I do with my free time is my business, Marion.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.844
- (LAUGHING)
- Please.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.810
Ethan Duncan is alive.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.646
- How?
- I don't know.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.563
But Sarah Manning tracked him down.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.000
Well...

16:15.080 --> 16:16.081
(CHUCKLES)

16:16.600 --> 16:17.761
This is a thing.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.280
It's a thing.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.370
Well, you know Rachel better than anyone.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.761
How do you think she'll react when she learns the truth?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.131
At one time I would have counted
on her to see the big picture.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.281
And now?

16:29.600 --> 16:31.523
She's taking things personally.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.643
If Rachel's become too entangled,

16:36.760 --> 16:38.091
we have to step in.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.166
She will fight.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.571
And she will lose.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.685
You know I was just thinking.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.488
Our paths rarely cross any more.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.766
My misfortune.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.680
But when they do,

16:56.760 --> 16:59.286
it's almost always because of Sarah Manning.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.250
- We need to look at that. Yeah?
- Hmm.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.328
CAL: So look, I've been working on
something for the past few days,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.003
and I think I might have the answer for us.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.127
<i>Okay-</i>

17:23.800 --> 17:24.847
Reykjavik.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.445
What was the question?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.284
I'm serious, I have people there.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.402
Uh, who's got people in Iceland?

17:31.720 --> 17:33.245
I can get the paperwork.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.326
I got money. just say, Yes-

17:37.960 --> 17:39.371
Come on, Cal, it's not that easy.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.809
All right, right on cue, the vague warnings.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.409
Look, there are other people involved.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.362
Hey, you know I've tangled with corporate heavies before.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.169
- Yeah, not like these.
- I know.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.882
Point is, I've made some friends along the way.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.689
I've got contacts, sources...

17:54.880 --> 17:57.201
Some of them are tin foil hat guys,

17:57.280 --> 17:59.442
but the chatter about the Dyad group, it's...

18:01.440 --> 18:02.566
What?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.529
Hey, listen.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.081
We're just gonna do it.
We're just gonna say it out loud.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.525
Okay, your big secret.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.531
Sarah Manning, I know this may sound crazy,

18:12.600 --> 18:14.250
but I think you're a...

18:16.080 --> 18:19.084
- A Pisces. Am I right?
- (EXHALES) You twat.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.606
- Yeah, yeah, makes so much sense to me.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.724
Whatever it is I don't care.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.765
Let's just get out of here.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.250
(MOBILE RINGING)

18:35.200 --> 18:37.885
- Yeah?
- Hey, Sarah. Look, we need your help

18:37.960 --> 18:39.325
with a little something at rehab.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.447
<i>What's Alison done?</i>

18:40.520 --> 18:41.931
She hurled herself off the wagon?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.081
- (SNICKERING) No, she...
- Huh?

18:43.480 --> 18:45.960
I am sober as a judge, Sarah.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.565
It's you, your people,

18:47.920 --> 18:50.730
your finks and rats and snitches and fuzz.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.049
<i>Vic's here and he's gonna give me up
to the police unless you meet with him.</i>

18:54.400 --> 18:57.370
I need you to come here right now
and clean up your doo doo.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.441
(SIGHS)
Vic.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.761
(IN DISTINCT TALKING)

19:22.720 --> 19:24.722
Come on, come on. Oi.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.167
What?

19:28.280 --> 19:30.521
- Where's Alison?
- Welcoming her family,

19:30.600 --> 19:33.649
it's some kind of public
flagellation day. Follow me.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.126
- VIC: Hi!

19:46.640 --> 19:48.130
I'm here, what do you want?

19:48.200 --> 19:49.281
(EXHALES)

19:50.360 --> 19:52.362
Victor? You have the ﬂoor.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.731
I have to atone.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.481
<i>“Dear Sarah,</i>

20:14.840 --> 20:17.571
"you are a rock in my stream,

20:23.920 --> 20:25.001
I'm not getting it, Vic.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.446
I have to apologise, okay?

20:30.920 --> 20:31.967
<i>Okay-</i>

20:32.560 --> 20:34.562
Good, yeah, fine. Accepted.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.801
Wait, I haven't done it yet.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.850
Uh, I atone you, Vic.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.605
- You're atoned, okay. Cool.
- Okay?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.569
- We're done here?
- Whoa, wait a minute, Sarah,

20:43.640 --> 20:45.404
you don't have anything you wanna say to me.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.643
After everything, come on,
the heartbreak, the finger loss.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.801
(SNICKERS)

20:49.880 --> 20:51.848
Okay, you want me to apologise to you?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.160
Which of the twelve steps is that?

20:53.240 --> 20:55.925
Sarah, I wanna have a conversation
with you, back and forth, like adults.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.365
No. No, no, Vic, we had a deal.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.887
You get to say your bit to Sarah
and then you stay buttoned-up,

21:00.960 --> 21:03.042
regarding Alison's little bout of criminal negligence.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.167
That was not the deal.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.041
New deal.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.289
- Mom!
- Babies!

21:10.880 --> 21:12.723
Hello, hello.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.162
I missed you so much, my little baby.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.089
Daddy says you're coming home soon.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.007
Yes, I am.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.411
As soon as Daddy deems me fit.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.370
- Hey, hey, come on.
- Right?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.807
Today's going to be good, right, nothing to worry about.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.887
Can you find your nametag on the table?

21:30.960 --> 21:33.122
- Oh!
- ALISON: Oh, look at that.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.490
- Where's my nametag?
- Look at that, that is exciting.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.766
- Yeah.
- Honey, can you pass my nametag?

21:37.840 --> 21:38.887
You know who made them?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.086
Honey, can you pass my nametag?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.887
- Relax.
- Sarah, you always do this to me.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.162
You always keep yourself at a distance,
you never let me in.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.362
Well, no wonder, with those giant banana hands.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.408
For the love of Buddha, could you please stay out of this.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.882
Listen, listen, hey, Vic, look I apologise.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.366
- Okay.
- Really truly.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.761
- We were two colliding train wrecks.
- Yeah.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.887
<i>Okay-</i>

21:57.960 --> 21:59.644
Sarah, I've been doing a lot of the work.

21:59.720 --> 22:00.801
- I've been reading.
- Great.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.927
Yeah, that's good.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.047
- I'm getting a lot better.
- Good for you.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.167
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.201
I want you back.

- Oh dear God!
- Piss off, Vic!

22:09.480 --> 22:11.050
Listen, I've changed, all right?
Let me prove it to you.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.690
- Not happening, it's not happening.
- Why?

22:13.200 --> 22:15.601
Why, don't tell me that
nail gun Ken is still in the picture.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.170
No, but you should see the new one.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.487
There's a new one?

22:18.560 --> 22:19.721
- Felix!
- What?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.848
VIC: Those guys, they're not you.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.167
I'm you.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.810
If you've done your homework,
I shouldn't have to introduce myself.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.646
Siobhan Sadler.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.846
I have to say I'm pretty impressed you'd come here.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.331
I have something you want.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.531
My favourite kind of visitor. Please...

23:23.160 --> 23:24.286
Have a seat.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.729
I have the early research
of Professors Susan and Ethan Duncan.

23:30.360 --> 23:34.410
Key formulas, methodology sequences, a summary on disc.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.321
Where did you get it?

23:38.280 --> 23:40.203
It's your missing science, Dr Leekie.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.206
What is it worth to you?

23:43.720 --> 23:44.881
Well, that depends.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.401
I'd need to authenticate it with Duncan himself.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.051
I give you Duncan, you give up on Kira,

24:00.120 --> 24:01.531
and we disappear once and for all.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.726
You drop your hunt.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.961
What about Sarah?

24:04.040 --> 24:07.249
Sarah, sadly, insists on fending for herself.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.641
But the child deserves better.

he was molested by elves.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.847
What did you give him?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.126
Benzodiazepine.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.605
In small doses it's perfectly recreational.

- Let's... Sorry.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.367
Nothing for once. I was fact checking.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.764
Seems safe to assume Rachel
doesn't know Leekie killed her mother.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.001
What, how do you know that?

24:37.080 --> 24:39.003
He told me, not in so many words.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.842
He does want Duncan silent,
and all the science to himself.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.646
Wait, you talked to Leekie?

24:44.720 --> 24:46.051
Divide and conquer, Sarah.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.243
But if we drop this bomb on Rachel,

24:49.800 --> 24:51.450
there's no telling which one of them will fall.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.086
