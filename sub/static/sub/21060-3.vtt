-Hands up! Hands up!

00:31.800 --> 00:32.933
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.967 --> 00:34.500
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.533 --> 00:36.600
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.167
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.200 --> 00:41.400
in a court of law.

00:43.033 --> 00:45.000
-In Palm Beach County,
you know, we have everything

00:45.033 --> 00:47.900
from million-dollar mansions
to very low-income areas.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.967
We have a lot of tourism
down here.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.767
A lot of activity
out at the beach.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.033
This is the community
I live in.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.667
My friends and family
are out here on the streets,

00:55.700 --> 00:59.433
and... I feel the need
to protect them and keep
my community safe.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.767
We now are responding
to a burglary to a residence.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.900
One of the deputies
responded on scene,

01:05.933 --> 01:09.367
saw a black male exit
the residence and run out
the back door.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.467
We're gonna meet up
with the K-9 and try
to pick up a track.

01:19.167 --> 01:21.200
-(dog panting)

01:21.233 --> 01:23.200
-Yeah, I think he-- he went
to the west of where I'm at.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.667
I'm a couple houses down
to the north of you.

01:25.700 --> 01:29.800
I'm gonna try to get over
and see if I can, uh, pick it
back up on the other side.

01:29.833 --> 01:32.200
When we hit that yard--
You guys didn't hear that?

01:32.233 --> 01:34.700
-Yeah, no, I heard him
right here, yeah, absolutely.

01:34.733 --> 01:36.667
-I think he went that way.
-If you look right here, though?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.767
-Yeah.
-There's a-- there's a--
the, um, the canopy's

01:38.800 --> 01:41.900
knocked over.
So he might be right there.

01:41.933 --> 01:44.300
-You! You!
-Stop! Police!

01:44.333 --> 01:46.233
-Get on the ground!

01:46.267 --> 01:49.867
-(indistinct shouts)

01:49.900 --> 01:51.067
-On the ground!

01:51.067 --> 01:53.633
-On the ground!
-On the ground!

01:53.667 --> 01:55.400
-On the ground!

01:55.433 --> 01:59.067
-(indistinct shouts)

02:00.267 --> 02:04.167
-(radio chatter)
-He's not back here?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.367
-This is the back door
where they last saw him.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.600
Over here that I did not walk.
I think he made this fence line,
and he-- and he hopped

02:09.633 --> 02:11.233
that fence right there.
-(dog panting)

02:11.267 --> 02:14.333
-We lost him back there,
and there's a footprint
comin' out right here.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.433
-Comin' this way?
-Yeah.

02:15.467 --> 02:18.233
This is pretty much
where we went through.

02:18.267 --> 02:21.400
-Uh, you went through here?
-Yeah, we--

02:21.433 --> 02:24.333
We didn't go in here,
but we pretty much
came out these bushes

02:24.367 --> 02:25.900
this way, so,
he's probably on us
right now.

02:25.933 --> 02:27.133
-Goin' westbound.

02:27.167 --> 02:28.967
Quick! Quick! Quick!

02:31.267 --> 02:32.800
-Watch out for the dog!
Watch out for the dog!

02:32.833 --> 02:35.633
Ma'am, go stand back there!
Stand back there!

02:35.667 --> 02:37.133
-(radio chatter)

02:38.333 --> 02:40.600
-Where's the house?
-Where's the house?

02:40.633 --> 02:43.100
-(indistinct shouting)
-Right here?

02:43.133 --> 02:44.900
-It's right here!

02:44.933 --> 02:46.667
The window's open right here!

02:46.700 --> 02:49.467
-(indistinct shouting)

02:49.500 --> 02:51.767
-It's Dane and Woodley.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.067
-So he raced
out the back, right?

02:55.533 --> 02:57.600
-No, he already ran--
This is the one he already
ran out of.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.700
-Got it.

03:00.733 --> 03:04.233
-You got somebody in here?
Okay, get-- get back
in the house.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.733
Get back in the house.

03:05.767 --> 03:10.133
-(indistinct shouting)

03:10.167 --> 03:12.467
-Guys, move! Move! Move!
Get outta here,
get outta here, come on!

03:12.500 --> 03:13.867
Just go! Just go!

03:13.900 --> 03:15.567
-Where's he at?
-He's in here!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.133
-Okay, go! Go! Go! Go!
-In the closet!

03:17.167 --> 03:18.967
-Right there!
-Right behind the closet!

03:19.067 --> 03:20.167
-Get outta the way!
-Move it!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.067
-Guys, outside! Outside!
Outside! Outside!

03:22.067 --> 03:23.933
-You're on his--
you're on his leash,
you're on his leash.

03:23.967 --> 03:25.433
-(indistinct shouting)

03:25.467 --> 03:27.867
-Hands on your face!
Hands on your face!
Hands on your face!

03:29.133 --> 03:30.533
-Okay, eas-- easy.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.633
-Don't resist him,
don't resist!

03:34.667 --> 03:37.867
-Give him your hand!
-Don't resist!
Don't resist!

03:37.900 --> 03:38.933
-I'm not resisting.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.733
-Give him the hand, now!

03:40.767 --> 03:42.900
-The other hand, bro.
-(dog barking)

03:42.933 --> 03:44.333
-I'm not resistin'.
-You were.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.200
-(dog barking)
-I'm not.
I've got my hands up.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.933
-Hey, put your hand back here,
don't move, bro.

03:47.967 --> 03:52.933
-(dog continues barking)

03:52.967 --> 03:54.367
-All right, get him up.
-All right.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.733
-Don't move.

03:57.767 --> 03:58.967
-You all right?
-Yeah.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.533
-How old are you?
-I'm only 15.

04:00.567 --> 04:04.700
-Where do you live at?
-I live over there by, um,
uh, Tenth Avenue,

04:04.733 --> 04:07.133
on Clayton Boulevard.
-What's your name?
Look at me, are you all right?

04:07.167 --> 04:08.967
-Yes. Yes.
-You're 15, dude.
Come on.

04:09.067 --> 04:12.067
-(helicopter overhead)
-It's your guys' house?

04:12.100 --> 04:14.200
-It's our house.
-Okay, obviously you guys
wanna press charges

04:14.233 --> 04:15.367
and all that
other good stuff?
-Yes.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.667
-Let me have the card.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.133
-Hey, chill out,
you're under arrest.

04:20.167 --> 04:23.067
-I don't have a phone number.
-Oh, your first name?
Spell it for me.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.233
-L, A...
-L, A...

04:24.267 --> 04:25.400
-V, E...
-V, E...

04:25.433 --> 04:26.600
-L, L.
-L, L.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.067
What's your birthday?
What year, bro?

04:29.100 --> 04:32.167
-Nineteen-- No, 2000...
1999.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.900
-What year?
-1999.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.367
-1989?
-99.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.833
-99?
-How old are you, bro?

04:36.867 --> 04:38.367
-Fifteen.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.333
-Okay, so what exactly happened?
-Haha... we came in,

04:41.367 --> 04:44.833
and you know, we saw
the police presence around,

04:44.867 --> 04:47.833
the helicopter,
and we went in, the dog
was barking,

04:47.867 --> 04:51.167
and we started walking
through the house
into the bedroom,

04:51.200 --> 04:53.767
and my wife's looking,
and she can't fi--
she finds her purse,

04:53.800 --> 04:56.900
can't find her wallet.
And then she's in the closet,

04:56.933 --> 05:00.133
and we're on the bed,
all of a sudden she starts
screaming. She had moved

05:00.167 --> 05:05.167
this one portable-type, uh,
ch-- chest, you know,
a plastic chest of drawers,

05:05.200 --> 05:10.233
and this guy jumped out.
She ran out. David and I
slammed the door

05:10.267 --> 05:13.267
and held him in the closet
in our back bedroom.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.633
-He almost took the purse
and I said, "Can I have
my wallet?"

05:15.667 --> 05:17.833
So...
-Okay, so you left it
in here?

05:17.867 --> 05:21.067
-I left it in the closet
where he was hiding.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.800
-Which purse is it
that he took it out of?

05:22.833 --> 05:25.633
-This purse,
that was in the closet
where he was hiding.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.967
-It was in the closet
where he was hiding.
-Where I was walkin' around.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.233
-You said his stuff
is in the bathroom?
-My-- The stuff-- Some

05:30.267 --> 05:32.833
of the stuff from my purse
was in the bathroom floor.

05:32.867 --> 05:34.467
-Okay.
You picked it all up, though?

05:34.500 --> 05:37.433
-Uh, yeah, basically,
it was just this hair thing,
and it was over there.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.267
And, um, that's when
I knew, and I saw
that my wallet,

05:40.300 --> 05:43.600
my purse
was in the right place
(clears throat).

05:43.633 --> 05:46.667
-I-- I think I broke this.
-That's fine.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.567
-No, I broke that,
'cause I was slammin',
tellin' him I'm gonna--

05:49.600 --> 05:51.767
(chuckles)

05:53.200 --> 05:54.833
-So how did your dog know
that he was over there?

05:54.867 --> 05:57.900
-Well, my dog went
to the original spot
where the responding deputy

05:57.933 --> 06:01.667
saw the suspect.
Uh, we picked up the odor.
We picked up the track.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.733
We jumped some fences, uh,
he went down the street

06:04.767 --> 06:06.467
after jumping multiple fences.
He went to that canal

06:06.500 --> 06:08.100
that's right over here.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.667
He jumped into some bushes

06:09.700 --> 06:11.400
and the helicopter lost him.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.067
I tracked right up
to those bushes, and he just--

06:13.067 --> 06:15.300
he didn't wanna leave the house.
So we kept goin'

06:15.333 --> 06:17.400
around the house, just seein'
if maybe he was in some bushes,

06:17.433 --> 06:19.767
or maybe
hiding somewhere else.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.633
And all of a sudden
we heard somebody screamin',

06:21.667 --> 06:23.600
which was the homeowner.
The homeowner had come home

06:23.633 --> 06:26.200
and found the suspect
in the closet.

06:26.233 --> 06:28.700
-They were probably home
for 10 minutes before and...

06:28.733 --> 06:30.900
like, when we got in,
I guess the two guys
were still in there,

06:30.933 --> 06:33.267
holding him in.
-Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.833
-So...
-So, it-- It all ended well.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.867
-At least he's goin' to jail
for the night.
-Absolutely.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.300
-Can you stand up?
-What?

06:40.333 --> 06:43.067
-You're up? You're not
gonna fall out on me?

06:43.100 --> 06:47.167
-No.
-You all right in there?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.100
-Yeah, my... knees.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.233
-Try putting your legs
on that side of the car.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.900
-I did, that's what I did.

06:52.933 --> 06:55.767
-Okay. All right.
Do you wish to talk to me

06:55.800 --> 06:56.967
about what just happened here?

06:57.067 --> 06:58.767
-No.
-No?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.533
-Okay.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.833
He's gonna be charged
with, um, one occupied burglary

07:02.867 --> 07:05.500
and two other
burglary to a residence.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.933
-I've worked for the Amarillo
Police Department
for three years now.

07:10.967 --> 07:14.633
My dad's been a police officer
here for 32 years,

07:14.667 --> 07:16.833
and my brother's also
a police officer out here.

07:16.867 --> 07:22.633
And I've grown up in Amarillo
also, so, going from watching
my dad be a cop in Amarillo

07:22.667 --> 07:25.567
and growing up,
going to high school here,
and then being a cop

07:25.600 --> 07:31.233
in Amarillo, it's...
I think it's been a pretty
easy transition so far.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.633
-(radio chatter)

07:33.667 --> 07:37.067
-We got a call saying
that there's a suspicious
vehicle parked behind a church

07:37.100 --> 07:40.367
with no plates.
Uh, the caller said
that there's at least

07:40.400 --> 07:44.833
one person in it,
and they're not sure
why they're there,

07:44.867 --> 07:47.067
so we're gonna roll by
there and see if they're
still there, and see

07:47.100 --> 07:48.367
what's goin' on.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.933
433, we'll be at the vehicle.

07:54.967 --> 07:59.067
It's on the, uh, west side
of the church.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.367
It's occupied by one white male.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.200
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.667
-What are you doin'
over here?

08:16.700 --> 08:19.233
-Oh, I'm just chargin'
my phone, 'cause they got
a plug-in.

08:19.267 --> 08:21.233
-Chargin' your phone?
-Yeah.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.267
-Okay. Well, is this
your vehicle?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.500
-Yeah.
-Is there another person
in here?

08:26.533 --> 08:29.800
-Oh, my girl.
She's asleep.
-Okay.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.400
All right, well, why don't you
have any plates
on your car, man?

08:32.433 --> 08:36.267
-It's-- I've been tryin'
to get it legal.
-Okay. Hey, why don't you, uh,

08:36.300 --> 08:38.600
why don't you hop out
of the car and come talk
to me?

08:38.633 --> 08:40.833
-Okay.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.433
-Just for now,
until we get this figured out,

08:42.467 --> 08:44.500
I'm gonna sit you
in the back of my car,
I'm gonna talk to her,

08:44.533 --> 08:46.933
and I'm gonna get
this car situation
cleared, okay?

08:46.967 --> 08:49.167
-Oh, I'm tellin' you
right now, it ain't stolen.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.600
-I kn-- I understand,
but I have to make sure, okay?

08:51.633 --> 08:53.233
What's your girlfriend's name?

08:53.267 --> 08:54.733
-Jessica.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.067
-Hey, Jessica?
-(radio chatter)

08:57.067 --> 09:01.467
-Hey, Jessica.
Can you wake up and talk to me
for a minute?

09:04.300 --> 09:05.800
You okay?
-Yes, sir.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.067
-Are you sure?
Can-- Can you step back
here to the back of the car

09:09.100 --> 09:10.600
and talk to me?

09:13.133 --> 09:15.067
You have an ID on you?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.467
Thank you.
Come-- Come on back here.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.333
Is there anything illegal
in the car you're not supposed
to have?

09:28.367 --> 09:31.500
-No, sir.
-What are y-- What are y'all
doin' back here tonight?

09:31.533 --> 09:34.567
-He was just chargin'
his phone and I was
just layin' down.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.167
-Okay. Cool.
What I'm gonna have you do
for a second, is I'm gonna

09:37.200 --> 09:40.133
have you sit on that ledge
right there while I get
this car situation

09:40.167 --> 09:42.067
straightened out,
'cause it doesn't have
any plates on it.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.433
-Okay.
-And I need-- I need
to get you outta here

09:44.467 --> 09:46.067
so I can check it out.
-(object hitting ground)

09:46.067 --> 09:47.367
-Ah, (bleep).

09:47.400 --> 09:50.833
That was all I had. That pipe.
-Well, you got a pipe on you.

09:50.867 --> 09:53.400
I'm gonna ask again--
Is there anything illegal
in the car?

09:53.433 --> 09:56.100
You need to be honest with me.
-Not anymore.

09:56.133 --> 09:58.333
-There's no drugs in the car.
-No, sir.

09:58.367 --> 09:59.667
-Nothin', not even a little bit
of weed?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.100
-No, sir. Go check.
-Whatsoever.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.067
-No.
-Okay. Do you have anything
on you I need to know about,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.833
anything illegal?
-No.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.500
-Okay, do you mind
if I search you real quick?

10:06.533 --> 10:08.867
-No, sir.
-Okay, put your hands
right here for me.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.467
Put your hands right here.

10:14.233 --> 10:17.767
Okay. Uh, go ahead
and have a seat on that ledge
right there. Just sit there

10:17.800 --> 10:19.400
and cross your legs
for a minute, okay?

10:20.700 --> 10:23.100
Is there anything illegal
in the car?

10:23.133 --> 10:26.033
-No, sir.
-'Kay, do you care
if I search the car?

10:26.067 --> 10:28.467
-Actually, yeah.
-You do care
that I search the car?

10:28.500 --> 10:31.533
-Yeah. I got a lotta my own
personal effects in it,
'cause like I said,

10:31.567 --> 10:33.633
I sleep in it.
-I understand.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.433
You understand that when you,
uh, say there's-- you don't
want us to search,

10:36.467 --> 10:38.567
that kinda seems like
there is somethin' illegal
in there, right?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.100
-There ain't nothin'
illegal in it.
-Okay.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.100
I just wanted my stuff
to be left alone, okay?

10:42.133 --> 10:46.667
Y'all pulled in 'cause
y'all expect the car to be
illegal, well, I'm tellin' you

10:46.700 --> 10:51.500
the car's legal, as far as--
I just haven't gotten it
fully done yet.

10:51.533 --> 10:52.567
-Okay.

10:54.900 --> 10:58.733
Hey, Jessica, I'm gonna sit you
in the back of his car
for a minute right now, okay?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.967
Step back here.

11:01.067 --> 11:04.200
Your boyfriend doesn't want me
to search the car, what--
what's-- what's in that car,

11:04.233 --> 11:05.900
Jessica, I want you
to be honest with me.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.267
Honesty is gonna help you
more than anything
right now, okay?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.833
-I have this (indistinct).

11:11.867 --> 11:13.767
-Another pipe.
So now you've lied
to me twice.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.867
-I'm so sorry.
-Jessica, what's in that car?

11:17.900 --> 11:20.200
-That's it.
-What else is in that car?

11:20.233 --> 11:22.833
-That's it, I swear.
-Well, you told me
that was it last time.

11:22.867 --> 11:25.233
-I swear to God.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.467
I'm telling the truth,
that's it.
-Are there drugs in that car?

11:27.500 --> 11:30.067
-No. Please-- Please
search the car.

11:30.067 --> 11:33.267
-Well, I have-- have
to get consent from him,
so, sit tight.

11:35.867 --> 11:39.867
She had
another pipe on her.
A second one.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.267
Okay, so, here's the deal.
Your girlfriend drops a pipe,
and then she gives me

11:43.300 --> 11:45.600
another pipe in the back seat
of my partner's car over here.

11:45.633 --> 11:48.400
And then you deny consent.
And I don't wanna violate
your rights, I'm not tryin'

11:48.433 --> 11:51.167
to do that.
But I think there's something
in the car

11:51.200 --> 11:52.900
that you don't want me
to find.
-There ain't nothing.

11:52.933 --> 11:54.367
We-- That's it,
right there.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.367
-I-- I don't--
-I will admit we did
smoke a little bit.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.500
What we smoked,
it was about a bowl or two,
and we smoked it all.

11:59.533 --> 12:02.733
There ain't nothin'.
-If there's nothin' in the car,
then why are you

12:02.767 --> 12:05.600
bein' suspicious about it?
-Because, this is my
personal effects, and it's

12:05.633 --> 12:08.167
where I live.
-And I understand that.
I'm just tryin' to make sure

12:08.200 --> 12:10.667
that there's no drugs
in my neighborhood
where I-- where I'm working.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.300
-And there ain't anymore.
Not on us, at least.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.100
That's it, right there.
We smoked it all.

12:17.133 --> 12:20.367
-Hi. Officer Landrum
with Amarillo Police Department.
You're the one that called?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.067
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. So what did you see
whenever you--

12:23.067 --> 12:25.467
-Uh, this is actually
the second time that I've called
from here.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.567
-For them in particular?
-Yeah. That-- That same car.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.700
'Cause I'm the youth pastor
at this church.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.767
-Okay.
-And so I just wanted
to make sure everything

12:32.800 --> 12:35.167
was all right.
-Well-- Well, uh, if you
wanna talk to the pastor,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.533
see if he wants
to trespass them
from the property,

12:37.567 --> 12:39.567
'cause there's a male
and a female--
-He's actually here, too.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.800
-Okay, well, if y'all
wanna call, in a second,
if you wanna call him

12:41.833 --> 12:43.367
and ask him if he wants
them trespassed,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.333
and we'll give you
the little papers,
and if they come back,

12:45.367 --> 12:46.633
we can take 'em to jail.

12:46.667 --> 12:47.833
-You wanna do that?
-Yeah.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.900
-Okay, I'll get started
on that.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.200
-Okay.
-Thank you.

12:52.433 --> 12:55.067
Okay, we finally
got a return on the car.
It's not stolen.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.567
So that's good.
But it still can't be
back here, so,

12:58.600 --> 13:03.667
we're going to trespass them
and send them on their way.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.800
All right guys.
Y'all know you've
been trespassed.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.300
If you come back here,
you're gonna go to jail, okay?

13:11.333 --> 13:13.233
-Yes, sir.
-Before y'all leave,
I don't-- I don't want

13:13.267 --> 13:16.167
any glass here in the alley,
so if you could-- gather
all that up, and take it

13:16.200 --> 13:18.800
to that dumpster
right over there, 'cause
I don't want people

13:18.833 --> 13:21.333
drivin' over it.
Thank you.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.100
You are free to go.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.133
Don't forget your lighter.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.367
You don't wanna litter.

13:29.567 --> 13:32.300
-Uh, Springfield's, uh,
kinda known as the Bible belt.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.400
We have a lot of churches
in Springfield.

13:34.433 --> 13:37.267
We have a lot of Bible colleges
in the area.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.533
Generally,
it's a wholesome community.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.500
We have a lotta good--
good people here.

13:40.533 --> 13:43.767
Most of the general public
is just really good here
in Springfield.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.333
They're appreciative
of the police,

13:45.367 --> 13:47.833
and, uh, everybody
just seems to get along.

13:47.867 --> 13:50.967
-We are about to make a stop
on a vehicle

13:51.067 --> 13:52.533
for a traffic violation.

13:52.567 --> 13:55.067
The vehicle doesn't have
a front or a rear plate.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.800
(siren blaring)

13:57.833 --> 14:00.467
-It's a red F150 truck,
two occupants,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.233
no license information.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.633
-(radio chatter)

14:06.300 --> 14:09.867
-(crickets chirping)

14:09.900 --> 14:12.067
-Hey, how's it goin'?

14:12.067 --> 14:14.733
It's Officer Powers, S.P.
The reason we stopped you,
you guys don't have any plates

14:14.767 --> 14:16.333
on the truck.
-Yeah, um, we went through

14:16.367 --> 14:19.067
a DWI checkpoint the other day
over there on Glenstone.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.400
-Sure.
-And they said that, uh...
they were gonna--

14:22.433 --> 14:24.967
he was gonna
put a notice on it,
'cause my plates were stolen,

14:25.067 --> 14:26.300
and I reported 'em stolen.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.433
-Okay.
So you said you went
through the DWI checkpoint

14:28.467 --> 14:30.600
a couple days ago,
and they took your plates?

14:30.633 --> 14:34.533
-No, they didn't--
No, I didn't-- I didn't realize
I didn't have any plates

14:34.567 --> 14:35.733
on it when I went through it.
-Sure.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.967
Sure.
-And he told me
that when I left there

14:38.067 --> 14:40.767
to report 'em stolen.
-Okay. Do you have any proof
of ownership of the car

14:40.800 --> 14:43.133
or anything like that,
like a--
-Um, no, it's just my--

14:43.167 --> 14:45.367
It'll-- It'll come back, too--
-Bill of sale, title, or...

14:45.400 --> 14:47.633
-The title, I've never
kept the title in here.
-Registration?

14:47.667 --> 14:50.067
Okay. Go ahead
and hop on out.

14:50.067 --> 14:52.900
Ashley, is there anything
illegal in the car
that you know about?

14:52.933 --> 14:56.600
-No, sir. Absolutely not.
-Okay. Are you on parole
or probation or out on bond?

14:56.633 --> 14:58.300
-I'm just on GPS.
-You're on GPS?

14:58.333 --> 14:59.400
-Yes.
-What for?

14:59.433 --> 15:00.867
-First degree tampering
with a motor vehicle

15:00.900 --> 15:02.300
and controlled substance.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.767
-Okay. Can you just have a seat
next to them right there, okay?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.600
-We're really not out
causin' any harm.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.733
-I believe you're not
causin' any harm.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.633
She doesn't have
any license plates,
so we gotta make sure

15:10.667 --> 15:13.067
the truck's not stolen.
-But Ashley, here's the deal.
With him havin'

15:13.067 --> 15:15.467
an open container
in the vehicle, I'm gonna
go ahead and search the vehicle

15:15.500 --> 15:17.933
for anything else illegal.
-Well, uh, the other night,
when we went through

15:17.967 --> 15:21.267
the DWI checkpoint,
the state patrolman said
that there was no problem

15:21.300 --> 15:23.967
with him drinking as long
as he's in the back seat.

15:24.067 --> 15:26.400
-Springfield says you can't
have open containers
in the car.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.233
So I'm just gonna
search the vehicle
for any further

15:28.267 --> 15:30.133
illegal contraband, okay?
-That was in this town.

15:30.167 --> 15:32.267
-We're not gonna
n-- negotiate that
roadside here.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.100
All right?
Is there anything I'm gonna
find illegal in the car?

15:35.133 --> 15:37.200
-Not that I know of, sir.
-Not that you know of?

15:37.233 --> 15:39.100
Okay. What about you guys?
Do you know of anything?

15:39.133 --> 15:41.667
Okay, is there anything
that's gonna poke me
or stick me or surprise me

15:41.700 --> 15:45.167
in there?
Awesome.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.467
The rear passenger
had an open container,
uh, which is a city violation.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.967
So we are just searching
the vehicle for anything
further that may be illegal

15:55.067 --> 15:58.067
such as drugs
or things of that nature.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.367
So far during the search
we found a syringe
in a backpack

16:01.400 --> 16:04.133
that was sitting
in between the legs
of the front passenger.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.767
Appears to have been used.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.767
Uh, we found a container
in the vehicle. It had a couple
of spoons and a scale.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.667
And then all throughout
the box you can see
suspected crystal meth

16:13.700 --> 16:15.867
amphetamine.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.867
I found another container
and what appeared to be
a loaded syringe

16:19.900 --> 16:22.667
with, uh, partial liquid in it.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.767
Um, there's a little bit
of redness, most likely blood
with whatever

16:25.800 --> 16:28.300
controlled substance
still left in the syringe.

16:28.333 --> 16:31.367
At some point it was used.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.633
Hey, Ashley, come over here
and talk with me for a minute.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.133
Go on down here
just a ways.

16:37.167 --> 16:38.567
Down here
close to my car.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.567
How long have you been clean?
-I peed dirty, um...

16:44.367 --> 16:45.400
in May?

16:45.433 --> 16:48.200
-Okay.
-And, I get peed
twice a week

16:48.233 --> 16:49.833
and I--
-I was kind of thinking that.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.200
What did you use?

16:51.233 --> 16:53.233
-What I got charged for
in Douglas County was pot.
-Okay.

16:53.267 --> 16:55.300
-So.
-Okay. Okay.

16:55.333 --> 16:59.867
So, have you ever used
methamphetamine or heroin?
-Oh, yeah, I did, but, uh,

16:59.900 --> 17:03.933
that was like...
-Okay. I found a loaded syringe.
It's right next to you.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.133
But I don't think it's yours.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.667
-I mean, I let them
borrow my truck earlier, so.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.867
-Okay. It's in a blue case.
-Blue case.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.767
-Did you see a little
blue case that's clear?

17:11.800 --> 17:14.700
-No...
-Did you see anybody
stick that there?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.367
-No.
-Okay.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.733
-But those two
have done drugs.
-So you had looked

17:18.767 --> 17:20.300
through your truck
before they borrowed it?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.200
And there wasn't
anything illegal in there...
-No. No.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.533
-that you found?
Did you look underneath
the center seat?

17:24.567 --> 17:26.833
-Yes.
-So you know for a fact
that there wasn't...

17:26.867 --> 17:28.433
-Yeah, there was nothing.
-anything there? Okay.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.400
Okay. I'm gonna have you
come right back
to the same spot

17:30.433 --> 17:31.933
and just have a seat, okay?
-All right.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.533
-All right.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.233
Come over here
and talk with me
for a minute.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.533
-I got-- really got nothin'
to lie about.
-Perfect.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.733
Was there anything illegal
in the vehicle that was yours?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.933
-No.
-Did you see anybody
with anything illegal?

17:41.967 --> 17:45.167
-No.
-Okay. Whenever-- You had
borrowed the truck--?

17:45.200 --> 17:49.200
-Like, they're-- they're
really not like-- I'm sorry,
I'm so nervous.

17:49.233 --> 17:51.400
-Okay.
-Maybe we've done stuff
in our past,

17:51.433 --> 17:52.967
but really--
-Sure.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.667
-We're not like--
-Okay.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.567
-We're not havin' that
right now.
-Good! Good.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.333
When's the last time
you've used?

17:58.367 --> 18:00.067
-Me?
-Yeah.

18:00.067 --> 18:03.200
-Ahh, it's been--
It's been months.
-Months? What'd you use before?

18:03.233 --> 18:07.867
-Uh, I used to use, uh, blow.
I liked blow.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.433
-Okay, so cocaine?
-Yes.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.200
-Okay.
-I mean, it's been a while.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.200
-Okay. Have you ever
used methamphetamine
or heroin, anything

18:13.233 --> 18:14.400
like that?
-No.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.300
-Okay. We're gonna
back up here to the same spot--

18:16.333 --> 18:18.500
here, fist bump--
We're gonna go back up here
to the same spot

18:18.533 --> 18:19.700
and have a seat, okay?
-All right.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.400
-Hey, Michael?
Come on over here
and talk with me.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.700
What'd I find
inside that truck, you know?

18:23.733 --> 18:26.967
-There was a box in there
with some paraphernalia
and a syringe.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.867
I admit that those are mine,
it's my backpack.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.367
-Okay.
-Uh, I'm gonna tell you
right now I'm tryin'

18:32.400 --> 18:35.067
to get rid of the stuff.
I've just dropped dirty.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.867
-Okay.
-From my parole officer.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.700
Now I'm lookin' at this stuff
today, and I'm like, I gotta
get rid of this.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.567
-Okay.
-I don't need it around me.
If I get it away from me,

18:42.600 --> 18:45.800
then maybe I can,
you know, get clean.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.067
-Sure. Sure.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.300
-You caught me with it
while I was goin' to get rid
of it.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.333
-Okay.
-I mean, the syringe, yeah,

18:53.367 --> 18:58.400
I was, it's got some blood
in it from me because I've
used it at one point in time.

18:58.433 --> 19:03.100
-Okay.
Well, here's the deal.
Um, there was a syringe

19:03.133 --> 19:07.633
in the car that had
about one unit in it
of methamphetamine.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.533
And also had a little bit
of blood in there.
And you admitted that, right?

19:10.567 --> 19:13.567
So, you're under arrest
for possession
of a controlled substance.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.600
-Oh, my God...
-Turn around and face
that away, okay?

19:15.633 --> 19:17.800
-Oh, come on, man.
-Well, I will tell you this.
I am gonna book you

19:17.833 --> 19:21.367
on possession
of a controlled substance,
and you've been cooperative.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.900
I'm gonna put you
on a book and release, okay?

19:22.933 --> 19:25.100
-All right.
-Hey, guys.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.267
You're free to leave,
but there's a car seat in here.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.400
You got kids, you seem like
you're doin' what you're
supposed to.

19:29.433 --> 19:32.133
But I found
a loaded syringe.
That's dangerous.

19:32.167 --> 19:33.833
Especially for a child
runnin' around.

19:33.867 --> 19:38.500
You've got somebody
in your car who's possibly
using controlled substance,

19:38.533 --> 19:42.633
and those things,
if left behind, are readily
accessible to children

19:42.667 --> 19:43.833
that could be
in your car.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.467
Okay?
Here's my advice to you:

19:45.500 --> 19:49.167
If you're gonna stay clean,
you have to be around people
who are clean.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.867
-132 and Bush, I've got him
at gunpoint.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.833
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.067
Cover is code three.

19:56.067 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.733 --> 20:06.767
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.933
-(theme music playing)
