a way with words.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.146
- Oh, no,
not that.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.016
As you know, mr. Critch,
I conduct the school orchestra.

I need a
second cellist.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.221
And now you show up
out of the blue.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.190
Yes, this is
divine intervention.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.892
Your friend,
ritchie, plays

03:47.928 --> 03:50.462
And now you will play
the cello as well.

<i> In my school?</i>

03:53.033 --> 03:54.699

03:55.469 --> 03:56.868
- Sister,
I'm flattered,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.270
Obviously.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.638
I truly am

But I'm really trying to focus
on my comedy right now.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.142
So, about the contest--

04:04.211 --> 04:05.711
- Oh, I'm not asking,
mr. Critch.

It's what I call
'me time'.

04:21.095 --> 04:21.960
Maybe--

04:22.095 --> 04:23.628
- If you do not
play the cello,

04:23.664 --> 04:26.531
There will be no
speaking contest for you.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.033

Aren't nuns stupid?

04:58.032 --> 05:00.198
Nun said she saw me runnin'
in the hall the other day.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.399
Know what
I told her?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.268
I told her
it wasn't me!

05:03.270 --> 05:04.135
Look at me.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.403
Do I look

05:16.283 --> 05:19.217
You got a face on ya
like a boiled boot.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.620
- Our nun principal
is making me play the cello.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.423
And she said to say
hello to you.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.958
Sister rose?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.261

since I've heard that name.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.370
Here.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.038
- I want to
be a comedian.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.973
I don't want to be
some dumb cellist.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.241
- Mm-hm, here.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.843
Everyone will
laugh at me!

I'll write you a note.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.713

Here you are.
Now...

05:58.726 --> 06:00.125
Don't open it!

06:00.861 --> 06:02.127
It's strongly worded.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.133
- What are you
up to?

06:08.268 --> 06:11.336
- I can't show an interest
in my grandson's well-being

06:11.405 --> 06:13.739
Without there being
some ulterior motive?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.342
- Not usually, no.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.384
It's your fault
that I'm here.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.653

for being your friend.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.822
Besides, I'm glad
you're here.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.091
My parents make me play
and I'm not very good.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.493
But with you
next to me,

06:34.628 --> 06:35.961
I'm going to look
way better.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.562
- Nice.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.031
- Huh, first thing
is how you hold the bow:

06:40.033 --> 06:42.567
Make sure your thumb
and number two finger

06:42.569 --> 06:43.835
Are across
from each other.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.436

I'm about to use?

06:45.472 --> 06:46.605
- Mark!

06:47.508 --> 06:48.707

playing with you.

Good luck with it.

[laughter;
applause]

19:27.433 --> 19:29.934
I asked sister margaret
if pets go to heaven.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.169
She wouldn't answer.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.070
I then asked her
if god created everything

19:33.206 --> 19:34.738
Then who made god?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.841
She told me to stop
asking questions.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.143
She's not so much
of a catholic nun

19:39.145 --> 19:41.144
And more of a
none-of-your-business.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.047
[laughter;
applause]

19:47.320 --> 19:50.654
<i>- As sister margaret dragged me</i>
<i>off the stage by the ear,</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:54.258
<i> I realized I didn't need to be</i>
<i> bob hope or eddie murphy.</i>

19:55.161 --> 19:57.028
<i> I just needed</i>
<i> to be myself.</i>

19:57.030 --> 19:58.562
[cheerful music]

19:58.631 --> 20:00.097
[applause continues]

20:21.854 --> 20:23.320
- Ho.
[giggling]

20:25.225 --> 20:26.690
Hm.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.225
- Hm.
Hm-hm-hm.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.695
- Gross!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.164
[gasp]

20:33.299 --> 20:35.332
- Sister rose:
What was I thinking?

20:36.603 --> 20:38.002
[music ends
dramatically]

20:38.004 --> 20:39.403
- Hey!

20:42.575 --> 20:44.074
<i> - Surprisingly,</i>

20:44.110 --> 20:46.277
<i> Once I no longer</i>
<i> had to play the cello,</i>

20:46.346 --> 20:49.046
<i> I actually kind of</i>
<i> wanted to play the cello.</i>

20:49.082 --> 20:50.614
[last note drags
across string]

20:50.683 --> 20:52.249
- Pop:
Jesus.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.184
<i> - I came to realize</i>
<i> that my family</i>

20:54.220 --> 20:56.254
<i> Would applaud pretty much</i>
<i> everything I did,</i>

20:56.389 --> 20:57.922
<i> No matter how lame.</i>

20:57.924 --> 20:59.890
<i> This was a bit</i>
<i> of a letdown.</i>

20:59.926 --> 21:01.692
<i> But it was also</i>
<i> a comfort.</i>

21:02.895 --> 21:04.361
- Here, boy.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.598
Good night.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.535
- That was really good,
my ducky.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.203
Just play it again.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.039
<i> - Some people</i>
<i> want the truth</i>

21:15.108 --> 21:17.774
<i> But there'd be</i>
<i> lots of time for that.</i>

21:17.810 --> 21:20.243
<i> I was happy to have a family</i>
<i> that loved me enough</i>

21:20.280 --> 21:21.679
