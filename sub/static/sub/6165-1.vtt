no weight loss, no drugging.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.812
If he's so dumb, how come
we haven't caught him yet?

54:00.654 --> 54:02.280
Ladies and gentlemen.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.117
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

54:06.285 --> 54:09.412
I'd like to introduce to you
a very brave young lady.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.664
Dr Kate McTiernan.

54:13.334 --> 54:17.128
Dr McTiernan will make
a brief statement, and that's all.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.672
No questions, please.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.552
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

54:28.515 --> 54:30.308
Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.689
First, I'd like to say something

54:37.107 --> 54:39.651
to the families who have
a loved one missing.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.487
Please, do not give up hope.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.990
There are other women
where I was held.

54:46.283 --> 54:49.327
And I believe in my heart
that they're still alive.

54:49.662 --> 54:54.624
Second, to the boys who fished me
out of the river and saved my life,

54:55.709 --> 54:57.377
and to the nurses and doctors here

54:57.461 --> 54:59.879
who are taking
such excellent care of me,

55:00.881 --> 55:03.508
and for the thousands
of letters and prayers

55:04.343 --> 55:08.179
I've received from all across America,
thank you.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.058
And last,

55:14.061 --> 55:18.898
to the man who calls himself Casanova,

55:19.692 --> 55:23.069
the man who took me
from my own home

55:23.195 --> 55:25.238
and ultimately tried to kill me,

55:26.657 --> 55:29.409
I broke your rules. Just me.

55:30.661 --> 55:32.704
None of the other women helped.

55:34.748 --> 55:37.333
So if you're looking
for someone to blame,

55:38.085 --> 55:39.377
blame me.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.758
That's all I have to say right now.

55:46.844 --> 55:51.055
Thank you for taking my message
to the families of the missing.

55:52.558 --> 55:55.184
And I hope it helps a little bit.
Thank you.

- No.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.447
- Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
- I don't know.

56:08.198 --> 56:10.783
- Do you hear the river?
- No.

56:16.582 --> 56:17.707
I hear him

56:19.209 --> 56:20.376
whispering.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.295
What does he say?

56:22.880 --> 56:26.966
I can feel his mouth on my ear.
His breath.

56:28.552 --> 56:30.470
He tells me that he loves me.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.097
ALEX: Tell me about his face.

56:34.058 --> 56:36.601

- What kind of mask?
- I can't...

56:50.282 --> 56:52.909
- What does it look like?
- It changes.

56:54.661 --> 56:57.163
I can't show him that I hate him.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.751
But you escaped.
What do you see when you escape?

57:01.835 --> 57:03.127
I don't know.

57:03.837 --> 57:08.508
I'm just running, and my legs
are heavy from the drugs.

57:09.468 --> 57:13.513
And I'm lost. I'm running through
hallways and there are all these rooms.

57:13.639 --> 57:15.431
I don't know where to turn.

57:16.642 --> 57:18.851
- He's behind me!
- ALEX: He's not behind you, Kate.

57:18.936 --> 57:20.186
You get away.

57:21.313 --> 57:23.648
How? How do you get out?

57:25.192 --> 57:26.275
Light.

57:27.361 --> 57:30.863
Light. In the light, in the sun.

57:31.198 --> 57:33.282
- Do you see a barn?
- No.

57:33.951 --> 57:34.951
- A house?
- No.

57:35.035 --> 57:36.452
- Cabin?
- No!

57:36.537 --> 57:39.831
There's nothing. Just the light.
It hurts my eyes.

57:40.499 --> 57:43.793
And then the trees. The trees again.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.379
And the rocks are digging into my feet,

57:46.463 --> 57:49.632
and I hear him shouting behind me,

57:49.716 --> 57:51.509
and I try to run faster.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.845
That's all I'm thinking, "Just run faster!"

57:54.555 --> 57:59.225
(SOBBING) And I left those girls behind.
I wasn't thinking.

57:59.351 --> 58:04.647
- I just told myself to run, to run and run.
- ALEX: All right, all right, all right.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.149
It's okay. It's all right.

58:06.233 --> 58:10.319
- I left those girls...
- It's all right. It's all behind you.

with these woods?

SETH: Yeah, I come up here sometimes.

59:27.231 --> 59:28.648
ALEX: What do you run into up here?

59:28.732 --> 59:31.734
I mean, beside the obvious,
hikers, bikers, campers?

59:32.486 --> 59:34.820
Locals, college kids. That's about it.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.825
- What about this river?
- It's good for trout fishing.

59:39.910 --> 59:43.996
It's been that way since
the early colonial period. It's over here.

59:44.289 --> 59:45.414
What? What?

59:46.792 --> 59:49.352
I still have to remember that my niece
wouldn't be fooling around

59:49.419 --> 59:51.629
- with some knucklehead.
- Right.

You okay?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.015
I'm fine.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.852
Really, I am. I'm fine.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.855
I'm just sorry I can't take you to her.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:15.528
I made an interesting discovery
last night.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.029
About what?

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:21.534
I ran a check on all the Sistol orders
over the last five years.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.620
- Guess what?
- What?

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.874
A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
came up on the list.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:32.295
There's no protocol for Sistol
in plastic surgery.

01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:34.213
Bingo.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.301
Two years ago,
this guy ordered enough

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.053
to treat leukaemia
in a medium-sized country.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.850
- What's his name?
- Rudolph. William Rudolph.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.021
Grew up in Durham.
Did his premed work here.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:56.235
Dr Cross, is it him? Is he bicoastal?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.572
Bicoastal?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.742
That's an interesting way of putting it.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:07.163
There are about a dozen predators
operating in California now.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:11.584
There's one, male Caucasian,
probably early 30s,

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:16.672
he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.342
And what I realised last night
was that his abductions,

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:22.678
they followed the ones here
by about 10 days to two weeks.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:26.599
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days
after Naomi disappeared

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.560
that a pretty, black coed
disappeared from UCLA.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.939
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.943
And if he follows true to form,
he's due to hit California pretty quick.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:39.695
Can the FBI pick him up?

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.865
If I get Rudolph to the FBI,
and they make one mistake,

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.117
what happens to all these girls?

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.704
I can't risk Naomi starving to death
in a cell somewhere.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:53.376
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:57.588
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.216
I think you're best served
by staying here right now.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.634
And pretend like nothing's happened?

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.319
No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.388
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.723
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:10.309
I know his size, I know his voice,
I know the way he moves...

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.311
- Kate, I know how you feel. Honestly.
- Would you please

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.064
stop treating me like I'm a victim?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:19.568
You think I'm some kind of tourist
in all this because I wasn't raped?

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:23.072
Every night, when I go to sleep,
I hear those women's voices.

walked past the window.

- How's that?
- When he told me that he loved me.

- I expect that's because he does.
- Please!

by about a hundred, Kate.

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.963
from Friedrich Thelen's Die Welt
der Flagellanten. Do you know it?

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.343
That took me three hours
to tie her up properly.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.679
And consensually, by the way.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:41.891
Dr Cross, tell me
you've got more than this.

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:45.561
I have pictures of Megan tied to a tree.

01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:52.443
No. I was thinking we'd discuss that
at the trial in, say, six months?

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:58.408
But maybe you would like me to go on
record now about Naomi.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.915
Let's start with the first time I saw her.
In my office.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:09.085
She was wearing a silk blouse,
which pleases me

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:12.255
because I like to turn up
the air conditioning

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:18.177
to constrict the capillaries.
You know, tweak the nipples.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.555
You should have seen
how self-conscious she was.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:25.017
How nervous the chill
in the air made her.

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:28.146
And like the others, her manner
belied her real predilections.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:33.317
Which reminds me, Doctor, have you
seen the photographs of Naomi?

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:38.197
KYLE: Alex! Alex!

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:43.578
Back up! Back up! Move! Move!

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:46.289
Put your hands down! All right.

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:51.294
Settle down, settle down. All right?
Everything's all right.

Naomi. Well, you're just as pretty
as your picture.

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:20.782
Beautiful feet.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:22.818

We didn't. He's not Casanova.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.692
His picture was on the wall.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.529
- ALEX: That's part of their thing.
- But his picture.

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.113
Kate, it's a setup.

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:03.324

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:05.785
Wick Sachs is the perfect patsy
for them.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:08.913
He's too smug and too vain
to even know what hit him.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:11.332
He's just a bush-league letch.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:14.627
The cops think they got the right guy.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.214
- I've been listening to the tape.
- Yeah?

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:22.093
Have you ever heard
a foetal sonogram? An ultrasound?

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.637
You know, on the tape,
you asked me if I heard anything.

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:26.681
Yeah. You said, "Nothing."

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.766
That's not true.

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:31.978
I heard something.
It was in the background.

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.813
It was constant.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:36.566
- I heard water.
- Water?

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.902
Everywhere. Below me, above,
around, everywhere.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:43.614
I had to have been in a basement.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.658

chicken house, doghouse...

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.289
- The FBI have checked everything...
- They missed it.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:54.625
Kate, I saw the aerial photographs.
They didn't miss an inch.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:57.044
There were doors, there were walls,

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.379
there were stairs.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:26:59.672
It was man-made. It was built.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:02.592
When you escaped,
you had no recollection of a house.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:05.196
You said there was light. That's it.
"Suddenly there was light."

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.432
And I had been in a house, Alex.
I am sure of it.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:14.228
Okay. Here's what we're looking for,
a plantation layout.

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:16.772
So now, there weren't plantations
on the Wykagyl.

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:19.650
- There was a plantation.
- What?

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.944
Check it out.
All this is Mason's property.

01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:24.071
All right, now, this is hundreds of acres.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:29.285
Here's the big house, slave quarters,
stables, cellars for stashing food, ice,

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:32.288
- tunnels everywhere.
- Can I see this?

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:37.043
- The river runs right through it.
- Where was I found?

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:40.046
Around here.
Two miles down from the big house.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.508

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:54.488
Well, I'm tempted to yank your chain,
but they're out there, standing post.

01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.698
- Is that what you call it?
- (ALEX CHUCKLES)

01:39:56.783 --> 01:40:00.535
Yeah. Thanks for indulging me.
I'll see you soon.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:02.037
Okay. Bye.

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:19.429

(SIGHS)

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:53.797
Well, look who's here.

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:07.978
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:33.587
- Hi, Detective.
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:35.725
Uh, I brought this from the property clerk.

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:42.262
I'm sorry. Would you like
to come in for a minute?

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:45.432
- May I get you something to drink?
- No, thanks.

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:47.596
The next shift won't be here
for an hour or so, so...

01:41:47.643 --> 01:41:48.643
(PHONE RINGING)

01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:50.437
I really ought to wait for them out here.

01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:53.273
Excuse me for just a minute.
Don't go, okay?

01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:59.780
Hello? Hi, Jen.

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:01.448
Son of a bitch!

01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:10.624
Quit hovering. Come on in.

01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:14.503
No, I'm not talking to you.
I've got company. Can I call you back?

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:18.215
Bye.

01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:20.133
How do you feel about Indian food?

01:42:20.218 --> 01:42:22.138
Oh, please.
I don't want you to trouble yourself.

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:28.683
I could use some help cooking,
and I have enough food for an army.

01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:31.520
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:42:32.897 --> 01:42:35.148
NICK: No, thank you. I'm on duty.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:39.236
KATE: Your first chore is to
slice mushrooms. Can you do that?

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.323
- NICK: I believe I can do that.
- If you don't mind, rinse them first.

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:44.825
- Come on.
- (PHONE RINGING)

01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:47.577
You should use a colander.
That way'll take forever.

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:49.496
It's down on the...

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:57.420
(PHONE RINGING)

01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:02.592
ALEX: Oh, shit!

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.844
How are you feeling by the way?

01:43:03.928 --> 01:43:06.930
You feel like you're getting back
on your feet?

01:43:07.056 --> 01:43:10.183
I guess if I felt solid anywhere,
it should be in this house.

01:43:10.268 --> 01:43:14.396
I've been in it one way or another
my whole life. It was my great aunt's.

01:43:16.607 --> 01:43:21.027
But I don't know. It's just different now.
Something's off.

01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.952
I used to walk in the middle of the night

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.913
down to the corner market
for a quart of milk.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:36.960
It's true. I mean,
people just get complacent. It happens.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:39.045
Would you please hand me
the big chopping knife?

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.634
NICK: The department gives courses
on self-defence.

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:47.387
I've already been thinking
about spending more time at the dojo.

01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:52.058
Oh, kickboxing's fine, Kate.
But that's not what I mean.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:54.644
I'm talking prevention.

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:58.481
We teach things like
varying your routine,

01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:01.985
keeping your lights on at night,
maybe getting a dog.

01:44:04.113 --> 01:44:05.906
I'm sorry, does this bother you?

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.408
It's good. I need to hear it.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:12.495
Just simple things
like carrying personal alarms,

01:44:13.664 --> 01:44:18.668
taking your garbage out the morning of,
and not using cordless phones.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:20.337
You know, anyone
with a scanner can listen in.

01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:21.922
What does taking your garbage out
the morning of

01:44:22.006 --> 01:44:23.256
have to do with anything?

01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:25.508
Well, the night before,
anyone can tear through it.

01:44:25.968 --> 01:44:30.180
Who in the world could possibly care
how much tuna I eat?

01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:31.865
Would you rinse this off for me, please?

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:38.605
Think about it. A guy could come by,
say, Tuesday night,

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:40.440
3:00 in the morning,

01:44:40.524 --> 01:44:43.693
dump your trash in one
of those 30-gallon plastic sacks,

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:46.613
haul it down
to an abandoned lot and bingo.

01:44:46.697 --> 01:44:48.949
- There it is.
- Thank you.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:52.535
What a lady eats,
how often she shaves.

01:44:52.662 --> 01:44:55.288
You can even tell
a lady's time of the month.

01:44:55.373 --> 01:44:59.209
Anything you want to know.
What kind of lipstick she wears...

01:45:00.378 --> 01:45:04.214
And used condoms.
How often is she getting it?

01:45:04.882 --> 01:45:07.676
Twice a week? Three times?

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.721
The same guy? Different guys?

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.890
Of course, that doesn't apply to you.

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:17.060
Let's face it. In your case,
it's been quite a while, hasn't it?

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:22.399
Not since that surgeon, what,
six, seven months ago?

01:45:24.694 --> 01:45:29.489
You were special, Kate. Do you have
any idea how much time I gave you?

01:45:30.908 --> 01:45:33.994
Months. Yes, months.

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.579
I sacrificed for you.

01:45:37.123 --> 01:45:40.041
But now I'm going to show you sacrifice.

01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:44.295
Oh, what are you going to do?
You gonna cut me?

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:45.588
- Do it!

Let's talk about it, okay?

01:48:22.788 --> 01:48:25.748
You wanna put the lighter
down, Nick? Please?

01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:27.292
She has to know.

01:48:30.379 --> 01:48:31.754
She knows, Nick.

01:48:32.882 --> 01:48:35.300
Then why don't you shoot me?

01:48:37.303 --> 01:48:40.513
I don't think so. Muzzle flare.

Room full of gas, all that, you know?

01:48:44.143 --> 01:48:48.938
Look, Nick.
I'm going to put the gun down.

01:48:51.942 --> 01:48:53.443
Look. See?

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:58.114
There, now. How's that?

01:48:59.658 --> 01:49:02.243
I want you to think about this, Nick.

01:49:02.328 --> 01:49:04.871
If you do this,
no one will ever understand.

01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:08.374
- Oh, don't mindfuck me!
- No, no, I'm not, Nick. I'm not.

01:49:13.923 --> 01:49:16.007
It's all about building rapport.

01:49:18.302 --> 01:49:20.845
You use the subject's first name.

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:23.806
And your tone.
You've got to keep it soft

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:26.184
and steady.

01:49:27.269 --> 01:49:32.357
- Establish eye contact. Seek his level.
- You want to know the truth, Alex?

01:49:32.983 --> 01:49:36.653
- You're the one who really needs help.
- Well, enlighten me, Nick.

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.405
Tell me what truth is.

01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:43.326
Truth is looking at a beautiful woman
like our Kate here,

01:49:44.536 --> 01:49:48.039
and saying to yourself,
"I've got to have that.

01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:52.835
"I've got to break her down."

01:49:54.463 --> 01:49:58.383
It's your basest animal self.

01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:02.887
Dig deep, Alex. You'll recognise him.

01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:06.224
He's ugly.

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:10.186
I've run into him now and then.

01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:12.605
Go ahead.

01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:16.818
Reach for the Glock and take me down
before I tell you about the 10 days

01:50:16.902 --> 01:50:18.695
I spent with Naomi.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:23.032
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.

01:50:23.575 --> 01:50:26.869
My brown sugar. Face like an angel.

01:50:27.705 --> 01:50:31.207
Perfect. Every inch of her.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:37.046
You never knew Naomi. Not like I did.

01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:41.884
Deep down, you envy me that.

01:50:43.929 --> 01:50:45.263
Say it.

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:48.224
I don't work like you.

01:50:49.727 --> 01:50:52.061
I don't hate.

01:50:53.605 --> 01:50:56.316
You only wish you had the courage.

01:50:59.778 --> 01:51:03.323
