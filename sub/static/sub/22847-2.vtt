00:01.460 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.296 --> 00:05.297
Take them.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.386
Where'd that rock send us?

00:10.553 --> 00:13.014
Well, I don't have many details,
but I do know we're in space.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.307
<i>I don't think humans are running
this place after all.</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:19.603
My name is Virgil.
You're not here to save me.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.397
- Who, then?
- Humanity.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.565
This will make a lot more sense

00:22.690 --> 00:23.774
once I show you...

00:23.899 --> 00:25.735
What the hell happened to Virgil?

00:25.860 --> 00:28.320
- The Roaches get him?
- Sorry to say. Was he a friend?

00:28.487 --> 00:30.489
All he said was that he wanted to hide
some people.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.491
So, I was hired to supply the Metrics
and swap them out,

00:32.616 --> 00:33.993
but you guys don't even have Metrics.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.620
If we can find the ship and fly above
the debris field,

00:36.746 --> 00:38.581
<i>we can send a message to Fitz
back on Earth.</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:41.667
- Tell me again about when you were taken.
- We were sitting in our favourite diner...

00:41.792 --> 00:43.919
Not where. When?

00:44.462 --> 00:46.297
That monolith was different, wasn't it?

00:46.422 --> 00:48.507
<i>No reason to send
a message back to Earth.</i>

00:49.258 --> 00:50.509
We're already here.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.324
It's gone.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.911
- Every... every...
- One.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.789
What was that?

01:19.914 --> 01:22.124
Let's hope this ship is designed
to take a few hits.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.340
Hold on!

01:29.507 --> 01:32.218
Thrusters are misfiring!
Talk to me. What do we do?

01:32.343 --> 01:33.552
You're the pilot!

01:34.512 --> 01:37.848
It knocked something out of alignment.
Nothing's working properly.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.726
Simmons... we don't want to hit that.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.691
- Are you trying to kill us?
- First rule of IT...

01:48.234 --> 01:50.069
turn it off and turn it back on again.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.032
Oh! No, this should be working.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.159
- No!
- Come on!

01:59.495 --> 02:00.496
Hang on.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.310
- This is Earth.
- We're in the future!

02:23.686 --> 02:26.105
It's all destroyed. Coulson please,
tell me it's impossible.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.399
I think we can all agree at this point
that anything is possible.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.234
Glad you're all right.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.945
Your guy, Virgil, he didn't tell you
anything else

02:33.112 --> 02:34.947
about his plan to bring us back
from the past?

02:35.072 --> 02:37.408
I'm just still trying to fit
all these ideas inside my skull.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.618
And you haven't heard anything
about a gateway?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.788
- A rock that transports people?
- If I had, do you think I'd still be here?

02:42.955 --> 02:45.291
There was no second monolith when I landed
on Maveth.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.251
So, we'll have to find our own way back.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.839
Well, I'm a biologist, but sure,
I can invent time travel.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.215
Just give me a minute.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.051
Well, without some miracle,
then we're stuck here,

02:56.635 --> 02:57.970
and we need to stay alive.

02:59.138 --> 03:01.098
Oh, and you... you...

03:01.223 --> 03:03.184
you all want me to help you with that,
yeah.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.060
Well, that's a big surprise.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.813
Well, all I can offer you is these.
Who's first?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.857
You think I'm gonna let you do that
to anyone else?

03:09.982 --> 03:11.692
You are lucky that I am even offering.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.154
The only way to not die is
to blend in and work hard,

03:15.321 --> 03:17.615
and you can't do either of those things
without these.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.497
- Come on. Keep moving.
- What do they do? Track us?

03:25.831 --> 03:28.083
- I don't think we want that.
- Well, I don't think you have a choice.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.210
Deke?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.213
- Tess, yeah, sure, join the fray.
- You took out the damn trawler?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.715
Where's Virgil? If you lifted off
in that thing without...

03:35.674 --> 03:38.552
- What? What's wrong with your face?
- I'm sorry.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.763
Virgil's gone.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.018
Deke...

03:47.228 --> 03:48.229
this true?

03:49.688 --> 03:50.940
Roaches got him on three.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.361
What was he doing on three, Deke?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.238
- That's a sealed-off level.
- This wasn't my...

03:57.363 --> 03:59.990
- What did you get him into?
- I... He hired me. Listen!

04:01.742 --> 04:03.827
He hired me to hide these people.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.623
- From where?
- Well, that's the thing.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.793
Remember all that deranged garbage
that Virgil was always spouting

04:10.918 --> 04:12.419
about people arriving from the past?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.380
I think you're looking at 'em.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.382
That's insane.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.426
Doesn't mean it's not true.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.721
We came through a gateway,
some sort of temporal shift.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.224
I don't want to believe it either,
but look at their clothes.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.727
They got matching buttons.
Not exactly locals.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.271
How can we prove it to you?

04:33.774 --> 04:34.817
Here.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.611
It's from last year. Still shiny.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.240
You don't have a Metric.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.742
Never did.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.956
That's... too weird.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.506
- Virgil said you'd be Agents of...
- S.H.I.E.L.D. Pleased to meet you.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.467
Then there should be more of you.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.304
There's one girl that went to go pry
the others away from the Kree guards.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.889
- You let them go face the Blues?
- I didn't let them d...

05:06.557 --> 05:09.143
They do whatever they want!
It's like herding rats.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.894
- Just go get them.
- Me?

05:11.312 --> 05:12.313
No!

05:13.147 --> 05:17.735
No. Think again. They are radioactive.
Virgil already got himself wasted.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.737
I intend to learn something
from his vacancy.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.490
I'll double his price.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.913
You don't even know the number
that you just agreed to.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.250
All right, fine.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.419
You stash these people,
you make them blend in.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.587
I'll see if I can...

05:37.421 --> 05:39.089
talk the others out of certain death.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.848
- I just... I can't believe this.
- Me neither.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.813
No, no, no, no! He's all right.
He's all right.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.234
How did you get that Kreeper's axe?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.654
Please tell me he was sweet on you.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.241
You killed a Kree?

06:06.784 --> 06:09.036
- It was us or them.
- Well, you made the wrong choice.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.371
Is that gonna be a problem?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.208
Two? You killed two?

06:14.291 --> 06:16.251
Yeah, well that's only gonna be a problem
for the herd of people

06:16.335 --> 06:17.795
that they're gonna kill in retaliation.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.381
- We got to cover this up.
- What do you think we're doing?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.799
We could just make it look
like an accident.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.467
- Shut up! Just let me think.
- Wait a minute.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.386
What if we leave them upstairs
with the other bodies?

06:26.428 --> 06:27.471
Use the elevator?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.352
We can't exactly be seen in the lift
with a pair of dead guards.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.687
Well, maybe we don't put them
in the elevator.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.733
All right, well, I hope you saved
some of your energy there, Tiny.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.905
What happened to the Earth?

06:47.658 --> 06:48.659
Good question.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.619
Ask anyone,
they'll give a different story.

06:50.786 --> 06:51.829
What's yours?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.833
All we really know is the planet
was torn apart.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.584
Some cataclysmic event.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.462
And the Blues showed up, restored order,

07:00.838 --> 07:03.841
but destroyed all historical data...
files, books.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.343
Said it would keep us focused
on the future.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.931
- Now they oversee everything that's left.
- What is left? What do people do here?

07:12.933 --> 07:13.934
We survive.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.496
Welcome to the end of the world.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.005
It's called the Lighthouse.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.008
Back when Earth was round,
this was an underground survival bunker.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.677
This is the Exchange.

07:49.928 --> 07:50.971
Need anything...

07:51.638 --> 07:52.973
this is where you get it.

07:54.516 --> 07:58.145
- Virgil mentioned stories... about us.
- Stories from when we were kids.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.439
Some of the elders swore that a group
called S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.149
would come from the past to help us.

08:02.691 --> 08:03.901
Can we talk to these elders?

08:04.109 --> 08:07.237
That would be nice, but the Blues got rid
of anyone who believed in the movement.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.490
- Fed them to the Roaches.
- To kill the belief.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.742
And it worked. Only Virgil held out hope,

08:11.909 --> 08:13.911
and everybody thought
that he was a crackpot.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.829
I'd like to see where he lived,

08:15.996 --> 08:18.749
see if we can find any clues
as to what his plan for us was.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.001
I can take one of you there. Sure.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.799
Move. Move along! Out, that way!

08:28.926 --> 08:30.761
Hey. Why don't you fight them?

08:31.053 --> 08:33.347
- We depend on them to survive.
- That can't be true.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.515
It's not right, but it's true.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.602
That's a lot of pressure to carry
the fate of humanity on your shoulders.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.355
It's taught us the value of a life.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.609
Everyone has a role to play
to keep the Lighthouse from falling apart.

08:45.817 --> 08:46.860
What's her role?

08:51.114 --> 08:53.951
Sometimes the Kree take humans
to their levels to serve.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.410
Call it an honour.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.205
But when they visit, they don't talk much.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.499
I don't see many guards.
We've got the numbers.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.044
And they've got the weapons.
We're not exactly military-trained.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.712
We are.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.883
Maybe that's how Virgil thought
we could help... to fight.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.051
Keep it down.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
Deke was right. You have to blend in.
Hear me?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.891
- Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.394
I'll take you to Virgil's room.
You two gonna be good?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.354
We'll get the lay of the land.

09:23.772 --> 09:27.150
Okay. Keep your head down,
do what the others do,

09:27.484 --> 09:28.485
you'll be fine.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.243
Great.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.161
You couldn't have told us
there was a skylight?

09:38.412 --> 09:39.580
What's a skylight?

09:40.664 --> 09:41.665
Oh, boy.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.001
It is what it is.

09:45.419 --> 09:49.881
I just can't picture somewhere so... open.
How'd you make that much air?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.009
We didn't make it. It was just there.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.762
You've never been in a place
without four walls, have you?

09:56.305 --> 09:58.473
- Do spacewalks count?
- Definitely.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.436
What about all the dangers...
earthquakes, floods, sharknadoes?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.938
- Feels safer inside, no?
- Okay, hold up.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.190
The whole sharknado thing...

10:08.108 --> 10:09.109
that's just entertainment.

10:09.234 --> 10:13.363
- Who would put a shark inside a tornado?
- They wouldn't. It's fiction. A movie.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.117
Like I said, we have pieces.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.413
It... it seems like it was nice.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.166
- You would've liked it.
- Quit howling!

10:24.374 --> 10:26.043
I did the grind.
I should get my share!

10:26.209 --> 10:29.630
You were docked for insubordination.
Now piss off.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.883
Tess!

10:34.051 --> 10:35.969
Trawler went out, but I didn't get a drop.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.306
- You hauling for somebody else?
- No, Grill.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.476
We were training a new pilot.
Virgil's dead.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.269
Really?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.063
Damn.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.734
- You the one filling his seat?
- No.

10:51.735 --> 10:52.944
I'm just passing through.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.657
That's a shame about Virgil.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.950
I didn't trust that head case,
but I liked him.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.663
Well... vacancy or no, next time...

11:03.580 --> 11:04.581
you owe double.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.333
Tess!

11:06.833 --> 11:09.836
- What did I just say?
- Double. Got it.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.926
- Avuncular fellow.
- Just like anyone else.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.345
Makes trouble if you make trouble.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.848
We got to come up with a system,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.434
'cause I'm not doing this every time
we take out a Kree!

11:24.559 --> 11:28.063
The system is, "No more dead Kree!"
We're two past maximum!

11:28.355 --> 11:29.856
So, hopefully, the bodies
are still warm enough

11:30.023 --> 11:32.359
for the Roaches to take 'em.
Here, right here. That's the door.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.581
Daisy, the door.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.086
Daisy? Pretty name. Like the flower?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.213
Does that line work in the future?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.007
I guess not.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.151
- Virgil loved his artefacts.
- You should've seen my office.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.994
Don't suppose you ever saw
<i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

12:27.622 --> 12:29.750
What about just plain old rain?

12:33.044 --> 12:36.256
- Only drips from reclamation pipes.
- But you fear sharknadoes.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.259
We need to fix everything.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.887
What about the surface of the planet?

12:43.096 --> 12:46.850
- Will it ever be liveable again?
- For humans? No.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.478
Land of the Roaches now.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.616
Virgil always kept this
in the trawler.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.203
Said the world might
look this way again someday.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.707
Crazy, right? But he was right
about you guys, So...

13:16.797 --> 13:18.215
- You two were close?
- Yeah.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.175
Not as close as he would've liked, but...

13:21.927 --> 13:23.762
He was crazy Virgil, you know?

13:25.347 --> 13:26.973
Could never take him too seriously.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.226
I'm sure he knew you cared.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.604
Yeah.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.564
You know anything about this?

13:37.818 --> 13:39.069
Maybe a flight log?

13:40.111 --> 13:42.489
- Think it's important?
- Important enough to hide.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.992
Virgil's the only one who had answers.
I just wish we'd spent more time with him.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.328
Me, too.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.089
That's the first piece of tech I've seen
on this floor.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.551
They keep people in the Dark Ages here...
no progress, no innovation.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.761
Meanwhile, the aliens are so advanced.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.556
Fitz would be going out of his mind.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.185
Time is strange.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.980
Somewhere out there, he's still fighting.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.441
But from our reference point,
he's lived his life.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.528
Or not.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.323
Shh!

14:27.450 --> 14:28.660
Something is going down.

14:47.762 --> 14:52.601
Today, Kasius has seen fit
to feed the most vulnerable amongst us.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.270
We've hit the North-Korean-dictator level
of creepy.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.733
Give me the bag!

15:09.242 --> 15:11.411
- Give me that!
- You got your share!

15:14.456 --> 15:15.498
Come on!

15:16.041 --> 15:17.417
- Yeah!
- It's a knife.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.531
What's she doing?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.659
I need to cauterise his wound.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.120
What's she doing?

16:00.502 --> 16:03.171
Okay. I'm sorry about this next part.

16:17.811 --> 16:21.648
No, no. You can't move him.
No, don't move him! You can't...

16:57.976 --> 16:58.977
Hey.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.529
- At least you're okay.
- What do you mean?

17:10.655 --> 17:13.366
- Wait, where's Simmons?
- The Kree took her.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.534
- What?
- How?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.077
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

17:16.994 --> 17:18.788
This is not exactly flying
under the radar.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.915
- What the hell happened to her?
- A servant got stabbed, was bleeding out.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.126
The girl saved him.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.295
She thought she was doing a good thing.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.882
These people... they're...
they're not like us.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.509
No, they're frickin' hazardous
and they're gonna get us all killed.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.513
- Maybe not. Maybe Virgil was right...
- Just stop it!

17:36.056 --> 17:37.307
Just the fairy tale was toxic.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.476
The morons that believed it
were eaten alive.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.853
I know, Deke. I know what you lost.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.523
But maybe they didn't die in vain.
Maybe it's real.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.691
And that's worse.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.820
If it's real... it'll be a massacre.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.448
We have to get Simmons.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.575
Hit them hard and fast
and get up to the surface.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.204
There's barely any surface left, Daisy.
The planet's been blown apart.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.582
And what's there is uninhabitable.
So out, not an option.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.835
- As far as in here...
- We get Simmons. I'll do it.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.879
- They won't know what hit them.
- Hey, hold up.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.465
No one knows you two have abilities,
so, let's keep it that way.

18:10.965 --> 18:11.966
For the moment.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.553
But right now... in this moment,
we don't know jack squat about anything.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.597
Including where Simmons is being held.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.268
Deke. He seems to have this place
dialled in. He might know.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.978
He's too afraid of making noises.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.522
Yeah, but that's 'cause
he's protecting himself.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.856
He has a scam up and running.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.067
He's afraid we're gonna blow it for him.
I agree.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.945
I'll tail him, dig up some dirt,
encourage him to help us.

18:33.446 --> 18:37.534
- Those tablets could have intel.
- Hello? Yo-Yo, master thief.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.912
I am not gonna tell you this again.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.833
Get them to blend in.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.925
That's my ride. Wish me luck.
We'll meet back here, yeah?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.807
You really don't know
where they might've taken our friend?

19:01.182 --> 19:03.351
Someplace I've never been.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.575
- Kasius welcomes you to his suites.
- Oh. Someone who talks.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.035
Please, tell me how the injured man
is doing.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.415
Please take this opportunity
to undress and clean yourself.

20:19.761 --> 20:24.140
Hmm. Even Hala
doesn't have a view like this.

20:27.894 --> 20:28.937
So...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.398
you're the one who saved a life.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.829
So, all this talk about protecting people,
and you're worried about your speakeasy.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.533
I'm in a Framework program.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.452
Oh, no.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.839
She must feel like she's stepped
into a new world.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.009
Mm.

23:06.511 --> 23:07.553
Pretty.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.890
But she appears more dormouse
than medical practitioner.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.476
Your actions caused quite the stir.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.563
- I was only trying to save a man's life.
- By rather elaborate means.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.275
- Do you have a name?
- Jemma.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.903
And where are you from, Jemma?

23:26.656 --> 23:27.698
Processing.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.452
Processing. Good we had you bathe.

23:32.036 --> 23:37.750
So, tell me, Jemma, how does one learn
such specific curative skills,

23:38.251 --> 23:39.961
working in sewage all day?

23:42.255 --> 23:43.339
My mother taught me.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.969
How resourceful.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.266
Did she also teach you the cost
of interfering in my affairs?

23:53.433 --> 23:56.561
- The man would've died.
- A life spent, a life earned, yes?

23:59.439 --> 24:02.066
You thought this law did not apply?

24:05.027 --> 24:07.947
I only did what I thought
would make you happiest in the end.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.954
That is the superior answer...

24:15.913 --> 24:17.290
to any question, really.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.835
This was a fight over food, Sinara?

24:21.836 --> 24:23.337
The pressure must be building up there.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.426
Tell the guards to give them
some breathing room, for mercy's sake.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.012
A renewal will do them some good.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.976
Life is a fragile thing.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.395
We must cultivate the beauty...

24:41.272 --> 24:43.399
and prune back the rest.

24:47.445 --> 24:50.823
I always found humans
to be inelegant creatures,

24:50.948 --> 24:51.991
but you...

25:06.797 --> 25:08.174
Your Metric... it's gone.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.593
I removed it. I'm sorry.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.432
No scar. Not even a scratch.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.852
Just a pristine canvas.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.526
Such marvels make me wonder

25:26.651 --> 25:30.947
if you're even from a place
as tough as processing.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.789
I think I would like to see
how my Servitor fared

25:39.914 --> 25:43.209
under your handiwork,
and if your wrist is any indication...

25:44.335 --> 25:45.628
I should be quite pleased.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.258
They keep the tablets in there.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.052
Once May gets Tess
out of the picture, we'll go.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.273
Hey, I rustled up some grub.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.899
- Pre-packaged, but it's decent.
- Oh, great.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.277
Listen, Tess, is there somewhere I could
change my bandage?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.570
Sure.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.155
How sure are you that's actually
a steam pipe?

26:13.406 --> 26:14.949
Um... Say, 50-50.

26:15.241 --> 26:19.078
Either Coulson's gonna release hot steam
or... raw sewage.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.705
Either way, it'll get attention.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.593
All right. Ready, and go.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.973
You should see your go-face
in slow-motion. Classic.

26:40.182 --> 26:43.144
- You're showing off.
- If you got it, flaunt it.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.149
They'll never know what happened.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.318
Let's hope not.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.236
<i>Humans,</i>

26:52.320 --> 26:53.654
<i>report for Metric inspection.</i>

26:54.697 --> 26:55.990
Remove the children.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.326
You heard him!

27:03.205 --> 27:04.790
Line up and present your Metrics.

27:07.335 --> 27:08.336
Your wrist.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.630
Next.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.466
This is not a good thing.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.594
So far, any new development in this place
is not a good thing.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.179
Why don't we put those on?

27:18.304 --> 27:21.307
- Because they go through your damn wrist!
- But without them, who knows?

27:29.815 --> 27:32.318
- I want to make a trade.
- Not the time.

27:36.530 --> 27:40.284
- I think it's exactly the time.
- Okay.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.829
So much for "passing through."
What do you want?

27:44.288 --> 27:45.915
I have a working Kree tablet.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.459
I'll trade it for three Metrics installed.

27:48.751 --> 27:51.170
I was right to be suspicious of you.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.965
A tablet's not worth three Metrics.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.968
But anyone who can steal it is, so...

27:58.844 --> 28:00.805
- I'll get you hooked up.
- Thank you.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.516
But you'll work for it,
and it won't be fun.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.017
Line up and present!

28:08.187 --> 28:10.189
- We can work. We're in.
- Get inside.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.578
Where is it?
Did you throw out the old papers?

28:24.704 --> 28:25.746
Yeah, it was a mess.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.581
Stop doing that.
You're always cleaning.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.250
Yeah, you programmed me to.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.545
Really? Because I don't remember
programming you to talk back to me.

28:33.629 --> 28:36.507
It was a joke, because I...
I did program you to talk...

28:36.716 --> 28:38.551
Just will you find the papers, please?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.721
Yeah.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.433
You may as well pull up a stool
and have a beer.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.940
Clearly, you're a talented pusher,
but I will pass, thanks.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.192
It's probably for the best,
because I have no idea

28:55.317 --> 28:56.694
what actual beer tasted like.

29:00.531 --> 29:01.741
You want to tell me where I am?

29:01.907 --> 29:04.118
You've passed out at my place of business.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.830
You got too close to my transmitters
when you were stalking me.

29:08.748 --> 29:09.832
So, this is your racket?

29:10.166 --> 29:12.168
You're... you're pimping out
the Framework?

29:14.587 --> 29:16.255
I never called it that, but yeah.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.176
That's the technology
the hardware interface is based on.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.513
I had to rebuild the software
from scratch

29:24.638 --> 29:27.057
because Kasius
had the historical archives erased.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.394
But I was able to get my hands
on the servers.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.396
I gathered bits of data here and there,
and...

29:33.773 --> 29:34.940
the rest is guesswork.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.442
But your customers don't know
the difference.

29:36.734 --> 29:39.028
You've got them addicted
to Earth-as-it-was scenarios.

29:39.153 --> 29:40.404
Among other simulations, yes.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.448
So, this is the business
that you're protecting?

29:42.823 --> 29:45.785
Your creepy opium den of fantasy?

29:45.910 --> 29:48.662
Well, I can't get real opium, so...

29:49.455 --> 29:50.581
I'm selling escape.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.958
The only other way out of here
is the final exit.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.252
They're trading one prison for another.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.383
You think the Lighthouse is a prison?

30:02.968 --> 30:03.969
Sweetheart...

30:06.472 --> 30:07.890
prison would be nice.

30:24.698 --> 30:25.741
No.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.326
Is this about my team?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.662
It's much worse.

30:30.538 --> 30:31.914
It's a renewal.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.345
I feel less good about this.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.698
What's a renewal?

31:06.156 --> 31:09.285
A low-earner will be selected.
Their Metric will turn red.

31:09.910 --> 31:13.539
Then they owe a life...
their own or someone else's.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.044
A life spent...

31:19.378 --> 31:20.588
A life earned!

31:40.149 --> 31:41.859
Come on! Move!

31:42.568 --> 31:44.153
Let's go. Come on!

32:09.720 --> 32:10.721
What's going on?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.765
It sounds like people are dying out there.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.516
A life is owed.

32:16.143 --> 32:20.064
Now, we stay safe in here,
but if that fails...

32:23.275 --> 32:25.361
...we make sure they find you first.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.874
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.717
- Hey!
- You gonna leave us here to die?

32:48.842 --> 32:49.969
That's the hope.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.180
If we don't, you and me are gonna have
a conversation.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.228
Where's an axe when you need one, huh?

32:59.353 --> 33:00.938
- Still too soon.
- That's not something to joke about.

33:06.860 --> 33:07.861
Where's Grill?

33:11.281 --> 33:12.282
Grill!

33:14.410 --> 33:18.163
My tab was low 'cause you didn't pay me!
Now you owe me a life!

33:19.456 --> 33:21.917
<i>I left you three out there.</i>

33:26.213 --> 33:27.715
Grill's the one you want.
Don't forget that.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.383
He's got to come out sometime, right?

33:30.009 --> 33:31.218
He strung you up for me?

33:32.803 --> 33:33.804
That's twisted.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.294
I'm sorry. I owe a life.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.221
He didn't have to die.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.684
Somebody did.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.571
- Is this the last life owed?
- Yes, Commander.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.958
This is unformatted. Who are you?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.920
I've been re-calibrating their Metrics,
but I...

34:48.754 --> 34:50.464
do pledge that they work for me, sir.

34:51.172 --> 34:55.469
- Is this true? Where's your station?
- It's true. We work in Salvage.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.638
They owe me a sizable debt, sir,

34:57.763 --> 35:00.015
so, they will be stationed here
a long time.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.605
Hmm. Carry on.

35:14.947 --> 35:17.116
I am happy you came to your senses,

35:17.783 --> 35:20.285
and I will be happy to call the watch
commander back if not.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.053
Trying to preserve humanity.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.850
Feels like they lost it a long time ago.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.859
What are you doing on your feet?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.863
Yes. She is right.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.116
What is this man doing up
in this condition?

35:59.366 --> 36:00.659
Of course, that you made the effort

36:00.826 --> 36:03.829
shows why you're the finest
of your people.

36:11.545 --> 36:12.546
Will it heal?

36:13.547 --> 36:16.967
- He is my most precious.
- Of course. It's barely been hours.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.179
But it'll scar.

36:21.138 --> 36:25.642
Um... Or with time or advanced procedures,
it can look much better.

36:27.519 --> 36:32.566
My servitors must symbolise perfection
when they represent me.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.617
Perhaps with his tunic on,
no one will notice.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.207
This, however...

36:49.917 --> 36:52.628
No, I can... That can be minimised.
No one will notice.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.421
- I will notice.
- It's a minuscule cut.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.840
On the man's face.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.343
- Please don't...
- I'm sorry.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.595
I demand perfection.

37:02.512 --> 37:03.680
He's now marred.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.900
Oh!

37:27.829 --> 37:30.749
Whereas you remain immaculate.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.379
- And a woman of your talent...
- What is wrong with you?

37:37.047 --> 37:38.257
A life taken...

37:39.591 --> 37:40.759
a life earned.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.303
- What is wrong with you?
- Silence!

37:47.099 --> 37:50.227
You are a beauty worth cultivating.

37:50.686 --> 37:51.937
But you must...

37:52.813 --> 37:55.232
learn... silence.

38:19.673 --> 38:20.924
The Kree have her.

38:21.425 --> 38:23.135
You can't help her.
To try is too dangerous.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.721
You said the same thing
about Mack and Yo-Yo.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.806
- How'd that turn out?
- A catastrophe!

38:28.390 --> 38:31.184
This entire place
is a very delicate ecosystem,

38:31.351 --> 38:33.562
and you all just keep taking a leak
in the water left and right!

38:33.687 --> 38:35.939
You worried we'll mess this up
or we'll mess this up for you?

38:36.315 --> 38:38.942
I mean, do the Kree even know
about this operation?

38:39.568 --> 38:41.361
- Because I...
- Of course, they know about it.

38:41.778 --> 38:45.657
They're crazy about it, because I'm...
I'm improving people's lives.

38:45.866 --> 38:49.578
I'm giving them something other than
just hour after hour of endless grind.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.665
They condone it 'cause
it keeps them placid.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.794
I have seen the Framework
in action before.

38:58.337 --> 39:01.423
Pretend that wishes are coming true
so the real hope dies.

39:01.548 --> 39:02.674
Hope is what gets people killed.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.176
Make them forget reality
so they don't try

39:04.301 --> 39:06.178
- to make a move to fix it!
- No, I'm making reality liveable.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.055
- Don't make any waves, because...
- No, you don't want to make any waves,

39:08.138 --> 39:09.973
'cause if you start a fire, you want
to know what's combustible in there.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.391
- We're mixing metaphors...
- Telling them to just chill...

39:11.475 --> 39:12.642
- ...all over the place.
- ...so they don't rock the boat

39:12.726 --> 39:14.603
- is so wrong!
- No, the boat sank!

39:15.103 --> 39:16.730
Do you understand that?

39:18.690 --> 39:21.902
We are a breath away from extinction.

39:22.694 --> 39:28.116
We make one wrong move,
and in a blink, mankind is gone for good.

39:36.625 --> 39:40.504
Wait. That... that... that... that's it.
That's what I'm looking for. That!

39:46.593 --> 39:47.636
Daisy Johnson.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.765
And you say you're not dangerous.

39:52.516 --> 39:53.642
So, you know who I am.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.894
Quake.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.148
You see, I'm the one person
that's pieced the history together,

40:00.273 --> 40:01.691
who has an idea of what happened.

40:02.651 --> 40:06.279
You want to know what kind of force
can tear a planet apart?

40:08.365 --> 40:09.408
It was you.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.498
<i>You think if you work hard enough...</i>

40:19.626 --> 40:21.086
<i>if you inspire them, that...</i>

40:22.421 --> 40:24.047
<i>you can put the pieces back together?</i>

40:31.221 --> 40:33.098
<i>You think you can save mankind?</i>

40:36.852 --> 40:38.895
<i>Give them back a world
with justice and freedom</i>

40:39.020 --> 40:40.897
<i>and all that other
pledge-of-allegiance garbage?</i>

40:46.987 --> 40:48.822
<i>I'm telling you to make peace with it.</i>

40:51.741 --> 40:54.953
<i>Surrender to it and make this your home,
just the way it is.</i>

41:00.292 --> 41:03.753
Because S.H.I.E.L.D. tried
to save the world.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.757
And you want to see the consequences?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.137
Take a look.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.100
You see an Earth that can be saved?

41:18.268 --> 41:19.311
It's too late.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.149
It's already been quaked apart.

41:59.226 --> 42:00.101
Jemma.

42:01.394 --> 42:02.812
You look wonderful.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.315
And I hear you're learning well.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.442
That's good.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.112
Just in time for my guests.
