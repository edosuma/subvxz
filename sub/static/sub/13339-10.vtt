WEBVTT

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
- Hannah: FUCK, I'M CRUSHED!
- Marnie: NO, YOU'RE NOT.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.346
- Adam: GO, GO, GO! DOWN!
- I'M TELLING YOU--

00:12.446 --> 00:15.183
- WE'RE FOUR FEET AWAY.
- WE'RE SO CLOSE, HANNAH.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.151
- IT'S CRUSHING ME. IT'S--
- HERE, MOVE.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.852
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
- YOU DON'T GOT IT.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.854
- YEAH, I DO.
- YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
A HERO ABOUT THIS.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.123
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I TRUST HIM.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.657
IF HE SAYS HE'S GOT IT,
HE'S GOT IT.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.926
- YOU GOT IT?
- I GOT IT. I SO GOT IT.
JUST LEAVE, LEAVE.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.395
I TRUST--
THE MOVE OF TRUST.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.962
LOOK, THERE'S
AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK
OUTSIDE.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.631
- OKAY, OKAY.
- GO, GO.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.533
- OW. ARE YOU SURE?
- YES, YES, YES, YES.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.402
- I'LL HELP YOU.
I'LL HOLD THIS--
- NO, NO, NO.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.104
JUST WALK AWAY.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.406
( music playing )

00:54.054 --> 00:55.456
GOTTA GET GOING.
I HAVE TO PICK UP

00:55.556 --> 00:58.058
THE KEYS FROM SHOSHANNA
BEFORE SHE GOES TO CLASS.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.829
- STAY UNTIL
THE END OF THE MONTH.
- I'VE ALREADY PAID RENT.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.831
AND THIS WAY, YOU'VE GOT,
LIKE, A MONTH TO FIND
A NEW ROOMMATE.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.234
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE A PLAN.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.369
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S
A GOOD THING FOR ME.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.539
OKAY.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.708
I WILL SEE YOU.

01:14.808 --> 01:18.312
- ON PURPOSE?
- DON'T PUSH.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.049
( door opens, closes )

01:22.150 --> 01:25.085
( engine starts )

01:28.722 --> 01:31.325
- Hannah: THAT WAS
REALLY INTENSE.
- YEAH.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.327
THERE WASN'T EVEN
THAT MUCH SHIT TO MOVE.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.995
NO, I MEAN,
LIKE, WITH MARNIE.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.298
LIKE, SHE'S NOT EVEN ANGRY,
I DON'T THINK.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.400
SHE'S JUST, LIKE,
REALLY HURT.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.303
- WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- GUILTY.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.973
DON'T WASTE TIME
ON GUILT, HANNAH.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.508
HOLDING ONTO
TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS

01:47.608 --> 01:49.109
IS WHAT KEEPS US
FROM GROWING.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.145
YOU'RE FORMING EVERY TIME
YOU SHED A LAYER,

01:51.245 --> 01:53.113
GETTING CLOSER
TO YOURSELF.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.548
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.185
IT'S HALF EMPTY NOW,
FULL OF POTENTIAL.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.320
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.055
- ( laughing )
- ( growling )

02:02.156 --> 02:06.794
- NOW MARNIE'S WEIRD FAKE
GROWN-UP STUFF IS GONE.
- MAYBE I'LL MOVE IN.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.795
REALLY?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.570
I HATE TODAY.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.572
I HATE TODAY SO MUCH
THAT I MIGHT NOT EVEN
GO TO CLASS.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.209
- WHY? IT IS
SO GORGEOUS OUTSIDE.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.177
IT, LIKE, REALLY GIVES ME
THIS UNEASY FEELING.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.745
IT'S LIKE THIS CERTAIN
KIND OF SPRING ITCH.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.614
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I SAW THREE PEOPLE

02:26.714 --> 02:28.148
TOUCHING TONGUES OUTSIDE
OF MY FINAL YESTERDAY.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.083
LIKE, THREE COUPLES?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.253
NO, THREE PEOPLE.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.921
UGH. I'M SORRY
YOU SAW THAT.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.689
WHERE'S JESSA?

02:35.789 --> 02:38.192
ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY
THAT I'M SLEEPING IN HER BED?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.593
UM, YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.695
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER
FOR, LIKE, A FULL 24/7.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.931
AND I'D TOTALLY BE WORRIED,
EXCEPT SHE'S BEEN TEXTING
ALL THE TIME

02:44.031 --> 02:45.266
AND ALL HER JUNK
IS STILL HERE.

02:45.366 --> 02:49.036
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME STAY HERE.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.938
I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA START LOOKING

02:51.038 --> 02:53.274
FOR A NEW PLACE TOMORROW.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.975
OH, MY GOD.
TOTALLY, DON'T.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.577
DON'T.
REALLY, DON'T.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.512
LIKE, STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.
STAY FOREVER.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.448
LET'S ACTUALLY--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:00.548 --> 03:03.116
LET'S JUST, LIKE, FIND
A PLACE TO PUT THIS,
LIKE, FOREVER.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.852
OKAY.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.454
UM, RIGHT HERE.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.156
( music playing
over stereo )

03:09.257 --> 03:11.625
( phone chimes )

03:14.628 --> 03:17.798
THIS BOOK IS
FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.902
ANYTHING BY A BRITISH WOMAN
IS JUST-- FUCK.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.171
HEY, RAY,

03:24.272 --> 03:26.139
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.541
BUT I'M REALLY
NOT FEELING WELL

03:27.641 --> 03:29.643
AND I THINK THAT I MAY
HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.445
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.081
MY THROAT JUST FEELS
VERY KIND OF LIKE ALLERGIC
AND SCRATCHY.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.983
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S JUST HOTNESS.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.686
I THINK IT'S FROM THIS
EXPIRED MYLANTA THAT I DRANK.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.655
MM. EXPIRED MYLANTA--
YOU DON'T WANNA DRINK THAT.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.457
( clucking )

03:43.557 --> 03:45.893
- LIKE YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET SICK?
- EXPIRED MYLANTA.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.995
YOUR ILLNESS COULDN'T
POSSIBLY BE RELATED TO
THIS TEXT MESSAGE

03:48.095 --> 03:50.163
I RECEIVED FROM JESSA
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO,
COULD IT?

03:50.264 --> 03:53.567
"PLEASE COME
TO THE MOST IMPORTANT
PARTY OF MY LIFE.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.037
7:00 P.M. SHARP.
DRESS REAL NICE AND COME."

03:57.137 --> 03:59.172
USE YOUR HEAD, OKAY?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.375
WE'RE IN THE SAME
FRIENDSHIP CIRCLE.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.011
ALSO, DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'VE WORKED HERE LONG ENOUGH
TO DESERVE A READING BREAK?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.880
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO ONE'S HERE, SO I
JUST THOUGHT--

04:06.980 --> 04:08.616
DON'T JUST THINK, OKAY?

04:08.716 --> 04:10.618
THAT'S AN EXTREMELY
UNATTRACTIVE FEATURE
OF YOUR GENERATION.

04:10.718 --> 04:14.555
EMPTY THOSE TWO PITCHERS
AND RUN HOME AND CHANGE.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.958
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS THIS PARTY FOR?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.560
I DON'T KNOW,

04:19.660 --> 04:22.262
BUT SHE TOLD ME
IF I DIDN'T COME,
SHE'D GUT ME LIKE A FISH.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.165
- ( chattering )
- FUCK.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.534
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.337
- WHERE'S HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND?
- I'M FINE.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.004
I'M IN A REALLY GOOD
PLACE IN MY LIFE.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.574
TOTALLY. EVERYTHING YOU OWN
IS IN TRASH BAGS IN MY KITCHEN.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.142
HEY.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.744
- I'LL SEE YOU IN THERE.
- Marnie: UH-HUH.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.780
- HEY, IT'S YOU.
- Shoshanna: HI.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.383
HE LOOKED AT ME WEIRD.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.752
SEE? TODAY IS
TOTALLY WEIRD.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.889
PARTY.
IT'S A MYSTERY PARTY.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.461
MY SHOES MATCH
MY DRESS... KIND OF.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.497
( music playing,
people chattering )

04:56.597 --> 04:58.966
THIS IS GONNA BE
AN "EYES WIDE SHUT" PARTY.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.501
GETTING THAT VIBE.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.503
Woman:
WHOSE PARTY
ARE YOU HERE WITH?

05:02.603 --> 05:04.405
Adam:
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A SECRET PARTY.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.740
OH, WAIT.
HE'S WITH ME.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.042
SHE'S BEING
VERY ELITIST AND CRUEL.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.646
- Hannah: JUST GET UP HERE.
- I CAN SEE UP YOUR DRESS.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.684
MY NAME WAS ON THAT PAPER.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.152
ADAM SACKLER
WAS ON THAT PAPER.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.688
YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.657
THANK YOU.
YOU LOOK VERY DAPPER.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.894
NOT ONE, BUT TWO PLAIDS.
( clicks tongue )

05:26.994 --> 05:28.796
HEH-HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

05:28.896 --> 05:30.130
UH, HELLO.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.299
HELLO, EVERYONE.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.267
IS THIS THING ON?
( laughing )

05:34.368 --> 05:35.803
( crowd quiets,
music stops )

05:35.903 --> 05:38.672
I'M JUST KIDDING.
I DON'T-- I HAVE NO THING.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.175
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL WONDERING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE

05:42.275 --> 05:44.845
OR WHO YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DOING IT WITH.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.482
BOYS AND GIRLS,
THIS IS A MYSTERY PARTY.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.551
AND I THINK WE CAN
ALL AGREE

05:50.651 --> 05:54.422
THAT THE GREATEST MYSTERY
IN THIS LIFE IS LOVE.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.056
( crowd murmuring )

05:56.156 --> 05:58.759
SO... THAT WAS WHEN THE MUSIC
WAS SUPPOSED TO START.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.928
- CUE THE MUSIC.
- ( music playing )

06:01.028 --> 06:03.296
- THERE WE GO.
- * Just a look
was all it took *

06:03.397 --> 06:06.199
* Suddenly
I'm on the hook *

06:06.299 --> 06:09.470
* It's ma-a-a-gic

06:09.570 --> 06:11.839
- * Follow you
and follow me... *
- HEY.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.974
* Everybody else
can see... *

06:14.074 --> 06:16.209
OH, MY GOD.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.078
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S THOMAS-JOHN.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.548
THAT'S THE GUY THAT TRIED
TO HAVE A THREE-WAY
WITH ME AND JESSA.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.550
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.618
* It's not that
I'm sticking with you *

06:24.718 --> 06:27.988
* Nobody makes me
feel better... *

06:28.088 --> 06:31.459
( crowd gasping )

06:31.559 --> 06:33.694
* Let the whole world
pass me by *

06:33.794 --> 06:36.163
* Take me to
the countryside... *

06:36.263 --> 06:39.166
- DUDE, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER...
- OH, MY GOD.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.400
I THINK SHE'S
GETTING MARRIED.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.470
SHE'S NOT GETTING MARRIED.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.338
AS SOME OF YOU
MAY HAVE ALREADY GUESSED,

06:45.439 --> 06:48.108
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
- WE ARE.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.044
( crowd cheering )

06:51.144 --> 06:53.881
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.117
- CAN YOU PLEASE HOLD THE--
- THANK YOU.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.952
- ( slaps )
- OW. ( laughs )

07:02.690 --> 07:04.725
HI.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.894
JESSA,

07:06.994 --> 07:09.997
THE FIRST NIGHT WE MET,
TRUTHFULLY,

07:10.097 --> 07:13.000
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE
GONNA HAVE A THREESOME

07:13.100 --> 07:14.334
WITH YOUR FRIEND MARNIE.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.269
WHAT'S UP, MARNIE?

07:16.369 --> 07:18.839
BUT WE DIDN'T DO THAT.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.009
WHEN YOU LEFT MY HOUSE
THAT NIGHT,

07:22.109 --> 07:25.145
I FELT MORE ENERGIZED
THAN I HAD FOR YEARS.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.515
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF

07:27.615 --> 07:29.617
THAT IF I EVER SAW
THAT CRAZY BITCH AGAIN,

07:29.717 --> 07:32.152
I WOULD MAKE HER
MY FUCKIN' WIFE.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.055
- ( crowd cheering )
- Man: ALL RIGHT!

07:35.155 --> 07:37.124
Woman:
WHOO! OW!

07:37.224 --> 07:39.560
- Woman £2: YEAH, MAN!
- Woman £3: ALL RIGHT!

07:39.660 --> 07:41.829
I WORE WHITE.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.597
WHAT?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.567
I WORE WHITE
TO HER WEDDING.

07:46.667 --> 07:51.471
I WORE WHITE BECAUSE
HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.541
BECAUSE NOBODY TOLD ME.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.743
WELL, YEAH,
IT'S A SURPRISE WEDDING.

07:55.843 --> 08:01.414
THOMAS-JOHN, WHEN YOU CAME
TO MY HOUSE WITH FLOWERS,

08:01.515 --> 08:04.785
I WAS PREPARED TO CALL
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.453
- ( laughter )
- Woman: YEAH!

08:06.554 --> 08:09.256
NOT ONLY DID I FIND YOU
VERY CREEPY,

08:09.356 --> 08:12.125
BUT I FOUND YOU
ALSO REALLY BORING.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.529
YOU ARE.
YOU'RE BORING.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.731
( laughter )

08:17.831 --> 08:20.568
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
I AGREED TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.737
AND YOU ASKED
TO MOVE TABLES TWICE

08:23.837 --> 08:26.039
- AND I WAS EVEN
MORE REVOLTED.
- ( laughs )

08:26.139 --> 08:29.777
THEN YOU STARTED TALKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.780
ABOUT TRAVEL AND FINANCE,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.313
AND I THOUGHT,
"THIS MAN'S BRILLIANT

08:34.414 --> 08:36.784
IN A WAY THAT I HAVE
NEVER KNOWN."

08:36.884 --> 08:38.351
THANK YOU.

08:38.451 --> 08:44.124
I APPRECIATE YOUR
ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT,

08:44.224 --> 08:47.327
YOUR DESIRE TO LEARN,

08:47.427 --> 08:50.197
AND EVERYTHING
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.465
- ( laughter )
- YEAH?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.334
IT'S A POSITIVE.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.969
- SHIT.
- I KNOW.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.305
I LOVE YOU.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.308
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:01.408 --> 09:03.310
I'M VERY MOVED.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.014
- YOU ARE?
- YEAH.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.250
- PEOPLE FINDING EACH OTHER,
TAKING SHELTER.
- Both: I LOVE YOU!

09:10.350 --> 09:12.352
I'M VERY MOVED.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.588
BUT THEY JUST MET,
LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.559
TIME IS A RUBBER BAND.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.995
Thadd:
AND NOW WITH THE POWER
VESTED IN ME

09:22.095 --> 09:25.498
- BY A WEBSITE THAT I FOUND
ON THE INTERNET...
- ( laughter )

09:25.599 --> 09:27.500
...I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.202
AHH!

09:29.302 --> 09:31.639
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.907
FREE THE BIRD.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.082
- Women: AW.
- ( crowd cheering )

09:49.289 --> 09:50.958
- IS IT GARTER TIME?
- NO.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.383
I MEAN, I NEVER
EXPECTED THAT.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.754
NOT THAT I KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM YOU,
BUT I DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.422
YOU DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.759
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CRAZY.
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S FAST.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.393
MAYBE I'M CRAZY.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.464
MAYBE I AM, BUT, FUCK,
HANNAH, I HAVE NEVER

11:04.564 --> 11:06.734
I FEEL LIKE I'M SLEEPING

11:06.834 --> 11:08.902
I'M SO GONE ON THIS MAN.

A TORTILLA SOUP CONTEST.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.164
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.666
I HAD NOT LAUGHED
ABOUT IT YET.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.302
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'VE READ HER BLOG.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.904
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD WRITER.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.473

WE SHOULD JUST, LIKE,
GO FUCK IN THE BATHROOM.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.224

13:11.324 --> 13:14.061
I'LL JUST SIT ON THE SINK

13:14.161 --> 13:15.863
HARD, AND I'LL JUST
COVER YOUR MOUTH

13:15.963 --> 13:17.597
SO YOU DON'T MAKE
ANY NOISE.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.167
YEAH, AND THEN I'LL,
LIKE, TURN ON THE FAUCET
BY ACCIDENT WITH MY ASS.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.269
AND THEN WE'LL COME OUT HERE

13:22.369 --> 13:24.504
AND THEN WE'LL JUST,
LIKE, WINK AT EACH OTHER
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.707
WE SHOULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT ALL OF OUR TROUBLES
AND GO FUCK SOMEWHERE.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.809
OKAY, GREAT.

13:29.910 --> 13:34.481

THAT WAS-- THAT WAS WEIRD.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.223
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.
YEAH, I WAS JOKING.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.626

WERE JOKING, RIGHT?
- YEAH. YES, I WAS.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.361
YEAH.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.899

13:51.999 --> 13:53.700
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.568
NO, ME NEITHER.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.104
IT'S A BIG PET PEEVE,
ACTUALLY.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.638
PEOPLE TOUCHING
AS THEY SWAY--

13:58.738 --> 14:01.041
IT'S VERY ANNOYING.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.744
NO, I LOVE DANCING,
BUT I'M REALLY UPSET.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.813
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.848
IT'S PERSONAL.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.817
GIVE IT A WHIRL.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.986
OKAY.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.723
EVERYONE'S A DUMB WHORE.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.025
I CAN HARDLY STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU

14:18.125 --> 14:20.160
SINCE THE NIGHT WE MET.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.930
- YOU ARE
THE STRANGEST PERSON.
- ( music playing )

14:23.030 --> 14:28.168
YOU'RE JUST-- YOU'RE SO--
YOU'RE SO RAW AND OPEN.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.371
YOU VIBRATE
ON A VERY STRANGE
FREQUENCY.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.076
ARE YOU PUNKING ME?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.011
IT'S VERY CONFUSING
FOR ME, TOO.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.015
I WANNA GO HOME WITH YOU.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.053
TONIGHT.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.557
FINE.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.561
FINE.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.697
JUST STAY OUT
OF MY EMOTIONAL WAY.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.300
FINE.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.102
SEE? I'M EVEN FUCKING
BETTER AT SLOW DANCING

15:02.202 --> 15:03.937
THAN I AM AT FAST DANCING.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.638
I HAVE AN AMAZING MOVE
THAT I DO TO THIS SONG.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.140
- YOU WANNA SEE?
- YEAH.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.242
* I ain't never gonna
shut you out *

15:09.342 --> 15:12.079
* Everywhere
I'm looking now *

15:12.179 --> 15:13.813
* I'm surrounded
by your embrace... *

15:13.913 --> 15:15.448
THIS IS HOW BEYONCE
DOES IT IN THE VIDEO.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.384
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE...

15:17.484 --> 15:19.352
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE...

15:19.452 --> 15:20.954
JESUS CHRIST, KID.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.922
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.424
WE'RE IN IT
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.260
* It's written
all over your face *

15:27.360 --> 15:30.097
* Baby, I can feel
your halo *

15:30.197 --> 15:32.165
* Pray it won't
fade away *

15:32.265 --> 15:34.301
* I can feel your halo,
halo, halo *

15:34.401 --> 15:37.304
* I can see your
halo, halo, halo *

15:37.404 --> 15:39.606
* I can feel
your halo, halo *

15:39.706 --> 15:42.609
* Halo.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.613
( music playing )

15:49.949 --> 15:51.618
HANNAH.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.586

15:53.686 --> 15:56.823

15:56.923 --> 16:01.028
UM, LOOK, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY THAT I--

16:01.128 --> 16:02.795
I DID GIVE YOU H.P.V.

16:02.895 --> 16:07.267
UM, AFTER WE TALKED,
I KIND OF WADED THROUGH
MY SEXUAL HISTORY

16:07.367 --> 16:12.172
AND RACHEL DUSETIK
ABSOLUTELY HAS IT.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.274
OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, I KNEW IT WAS HER,

16:14.374 --> 16:15.808
'CAUSE THAT GIRL WEARS
FLORAL CAPRIS

16:15.908 --> 16:17.177
LIKE HER HYMEN'S
STILL INTACT,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.146
BUT SHE WAS SUCH A SLUT
IN SUCH A BIG WAY.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.780
IN A HUGE WAY.
SHE USED TO DO THIS THING

16:20.880 --> 16:22.315
WHERE SHE WOULD RIP
THE CONDOM OFF.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.217
- LIKE...

16:24.317 --> 16:26.119
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.057
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.424
OH, COME ON.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.526
- YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE HAS IT.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.896
LET'S JUST CONSIDER IT
WATER UNDER... MY VAGINA.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.365
( laughs )

16:38.465 --> 16:39.399
- HONEY.

THE CAMEL'S BACK?
- YEAH.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.348

LIKE CAMRYN MANHEIM.
- HONEY.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.385
SO ARE YOU TWO, LIKE,
LIVING TOGETHER NOW?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.620
- OH, NO.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.290
I WISH, BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT
TILL TEMPLETON'S GRADUATED.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.193
YES, TEMPLETON
IS GEORGE'S SON,

17:06.292 --> 17:08.661
AND HE'S EXTREMELY
HOMOPHOBIC.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.363
- WOW.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365
SO I'VE BEEN LIVING IN
AN S.R.O. SINCE I LEFT BO,

17:12.464 --> 17:14.601
WHICH IS AN APARTMENT
WHERE YOU SHARE

17:14.701 --> 17:16.803
- A BATHROOM WITH--
- EVERYONE ON YOUR FLOOR.

17:16.903 --> 17:20.173
IT'S LIKE MURDERERS
AND, LIKE, JUNKIES
AND GIRLS WHO HUFF.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.973
- LIKE--

17:22.075 --> 17:23.742
IT'S NOT GREAT.

WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IN LUCK

17:26.613 --> 17:29.416
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
NEED A ROOMMATE.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.551
OH! I MEAN,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.520

- OY, SOUNDS LIKE KISMET.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.155
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.923
- WE BOTH HAVE H.P.V. ALREADY.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.825

17:43.763 --> 17:45.332
Elijah:
IT'S-- YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE THAT THING.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.666
A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
DISEASE.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.001
- YEAH, BUT FOR GIRLS.

( music playing )

18:02.482 --> 18:05.084
* When you left my house
in the morning... *

18:05.185 --> 18:07.019
WHY ARE YOU EVEN TRYING?
YOU HATE SWEET STUFF.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.289

- HI.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.823
SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.661

- ABOUT MOVING IN,
BECAUSE I FOUND SOMEONE.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.463
YOU FOUND SOMEONE.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.399
IT'S GONNA SOUND CRAZY,
BUT IT'S ELIJAH.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.868

18:25.272 --> 18:26.473
WHICH IS LITERALLY
THE GAYEST THING

18:26.573 --> 18:28.175
I'VE EVER HEARD
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.910
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA,
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

18:31.010 --> 18:34.113
NO, IT'S-- YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING
TO HELP AND I APPRECIATE IT--

18:34.214 --> 18:36.349
HELP?
I DON'T WANNA HELP.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.884
NO ONE DOES ANYTHING
'CAUSE THEY WANNA HELP.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.487
I WAS DOING IT
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.190
OH.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.859
WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO SURPRISED?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.862
NO, IT'S JUST LIKE--
YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T
THINK YOU WERE INTO THAT.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.599

18:52.699 --> 18:55.335
NO, I JUST-- YOU KNOW,
I JUST ASSOCIATE THAT WITH,
LIKE, MARNIE AND CHARLIE

18:55.435 --> 18:57.036
AND PEOPLE STARTING
TO TALK A LOT

18:57.136 --> 18:58.838
ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP,
YOU KNOW?

18:58.938 --> 19:00.773
IT'S LIKE,
"MY RELATIONSHIP IS DOING
REALLY WELL RIGHT NOW,"

19:00.873 --> 19:02.975
OR "I NEED TO WORK
ON SOME ASPECTS OF
MY RELATIONSHIP."

19:03.075 --> 19:04.677
AND IT'S JUST LIKE,
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT A THING.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.379
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.248
I'VE GOT ACTUAL THINGS
I WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE

19:08.348 --> 19:09.616
BEFORE I FOCUS
ON, LIKE, THAT.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.884
AND YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE
THOSE THINGS WITH ME?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.587
NO, IT'S-- IT'S NOT THAT.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.088
IT'S JUST-- DON'T YOU
FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES

19:16.189 --> 19:17.424
YOU AND I DISTRACT
EACH OTHER FROM

19:17.524 --> 19:19.559
THE OTHER STUFF
THAT WE HAVE GOING ON--

19:19.659 --> 19:21.894
OKAY, I DON'T WANNA
FLIP OUT ON YOU RIGHT NOW
AT A SURPRISE WEDDING.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.397
IF YOU WANNA FUCK ME
FROM BEHIND, AT LEAST
PULL MY HAIR BACK.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.032
ADAM.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.267

19:37.377 --> 19:40.347

19:40.447 --> 19:42.982
- HA HA HA!

19:43.082 --> 19:45.385

OR IS HE ADORABLE?

19:45.485 --> 19:48.120
- ARE YOU OKAY?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.457

20:01.200 --> 20:02.635
OH, MY GOD,

20:02.735 --> 20:04.871

20:07.507 --> 20:09.709
IS THIS WHAT

20:09.809 --> 20:12.011
( laughs )

20:12.111 --> 20:15.648
- WAIT!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.750

20:17.850 --> 20:20.820

20:24.791 --> 20:26.025
UH!

20:26.125 --> 20:28.127
Crowd: BYE!

20:28.227 --> 20:30.463
Jessa:
THANK YOU.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.835
YO!

20:41.441 --> 20:43.743
WHY ARE YOU
SO MAD AT ME?

20:43.843 --> 20:47.113
I BROUGHT YOU CAKE,
SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE
SWEET STUFF, IT'S AMAZING--

20:47.213 --> 20:50.450
YOU LOVE YOURSELF SO MUCH.
SO WHY IS IT SO CRAZY THAT
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD, TOO?

20:50.550 --> 20:52.552
I DON'T LOVE MYSELF.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.521
YOU'RE THE FUCKING WORST,
YOU KNOW THAT?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.389
BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT PRETTY

20:56.489 --> 20:58.391
AND YOU'RE NOT A GOOD WRITER
AND YOU'RE NOT A GOOD FRIEND.

20:58.491 --> 21:02.929
WELL, YOU ARE PRETTY
AND YOU ARE A GOOD WRITER
AND YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.231
UM, THANK YOU.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.999
IS THIS THE GAME?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.235
YOU CHASE ME LIKE
I'M THE FUCKING BEATLES
FOR SIX MONTHS,

21:09.336 --> 21:11.871
AND THEN I FINALLY
GET COMFORTABLE
AND YOU SHRUG?

21:14.173 --> 21:15.742
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

21:17.043 --> 21:18.611
I'M SCARED, OKAY?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.613
I'M REALLY SCARED
ALL THE TIME.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.482
I'M, LIKE, VERY SCARED
ALL THE TIME.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.385
JOIN THE FUCKING CLUB.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.220
NO, BECAUSE I'M MORE SCARED
THAN MOST PEOPLE ARE

21:28.321 --> 21:29.789
WHEN THEY SAY
THAT THEY'RE SCARED.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.359
I'M LIKE THE MOST SCARED
PERSON WHO'S ALIVE.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.727
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BE!

21:34.827 --> 21:39.499
I TOLD YOU ONCE
I COMMIT TO SOMETHING,
I REALLY FUCKING COMMIT!

21:39.599 --> 21:41.200
YOU ASKED FOR THIS!

21:41.300 --> 21:43.202
AND NOW YOU'RE BEING
A FUCKING BITCH.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.138
ADAM, COME ON, OKAY?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.574
YOU'RE SCARED.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.542
I'M LOOKING AT YOU.
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.411
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE YOU'RE NOT,
BUT YOU ARE.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.212
I KNOW YOU NOW.
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A WHILE.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.481
- I KNOW YOU NOW.
- STOP, STOP.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.115
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.484
YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT
ABOUT ME.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.752
- ( horn blares )
- GET OUT OF THE STREET!

21:59.852 --> 22:01.921
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOURSELF.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.991
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE,
WHAT, 11 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT,
YOU KNOW STRUGGLE?

22:05.091 --> 22:08.995
I AM 13 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT
AND IT HAS BEEN AWFUL
FOR ME MY WHOLE LIFE!

22:09.095 --> 22:10.463
HOLY FUCKIN' SHIT!

22:10.563 --> 22:13.165
HERE'S THE WORLD'S
SMALLEST, TINY VIOLIN

22:13.265 --> 22:15.234
PLAYING "MY HEART
BLEEDS FOR YOU."

22:15.334 --> 22:17.570
FUCK YOU!
YOU DON'T KNOW STRUGGLE.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.072
I'M A BEAUTIFUL
FUCKING MYSTERY TO YOU.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.842
( screams )
NO!

22:22.942 --> 22:24.877
FUCK!

22:26.946 --> 22:29.582
HEY THERE.
NICE WORK.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.652
YEAH, WELL, SHE KIND OF
THREW IT AT ME, BUT THANK YOU.

22:32.752 --> 22:36.923
YEAH. I MEAN,
A GIRL LIKE YOU DOESN'T
EXACTLY NEED A BOUQUET.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.025
WHY DON'T YOU PICK ON
SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.594
- ( snickers )
- THAT WAS DUMB.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.596
OH, GOD.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.532
- IS THIS PARTY
REALLY OVER?
- I KNOW.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.934
- I WAS JUST GETTING STARTED.
- SERIOUSLY.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.769
THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.272
BUT, I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY
HAVE SOMEPLACE TO BE.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.675
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.512
I CAN'T STOP.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.247
- OH, YOU'RE JUST
GOING FOR IT, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.416
I THINK I JUST
FELL IN LOVE.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.652
- ( mumbles ) REALLY?
- A LITTLE BIT.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.521
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.890
I THINK SOME CAKE
JUST WENT IN MY CLEAVAGE.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.860
I'M NOT GONNA LOOK,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD NOT
BE GENTLEMANLY.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.195
WOULD IT BE-- ALTHOUGH,
HELPING WOULD BE--

23:16.295 --> 23:18.364
I'D LIKE YOU TO HELP.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.667
THAT LOOKS AWESOME.
I'D LIKE TO GO THERE...

23:23.903 --> 23:25.738
SOMEDAY.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.374
MAN, I AM NOT GOOD
AT THIS.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.710
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE SO FORWARD.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.748
( music playing )

23:44.657 --> 23:47.159
Shoshanna:
IT DOESN'T HURT.

23:47.259 --> 23:51.063
WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE I
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.566
( softly )
RIGHT.

23:56.969 --> 24:01.073
MY-- MY AUNT SAYS THAT
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE
SCRATCHING A SUNBURN.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.143
OKAY.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.650
I KNOW YOU HATE VIRGINS.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.485
YOU TOTALLY HATE VIRGINS.
YOU TOTALLY LIED TO ME.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.286
- YOU HATE ME SO MUCH.
- NO--

24:14.386 --> 24:16.122
YOU TOTALLY LIED
ABOUT LIKING ME.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.857
- YOU DON'T LIKE ME AT ALL.
- SHH. IT'S NOT THAT
AT ALL, OKAY?

24:17.957 --> 24:20.292
IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST--
( sighs )

24:20.392 --> 24:23.429
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME,
YOU KNOW, THAT--

24:23.530 --> 24:27.534
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE,

24:27.634 --> 24:30.703
AND, THUSLY,
I AM TEACHING YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.205
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A LOT OF POWER,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.842
WHICH I DON'T KNOW
IF I DESERVE.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.211
OKAY.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.682
BUT I PROBABLY DO.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.217
Hannah:
I THINK HE HAS
A CONCUSSION.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.720
I WISH I HAD
A FUCKING CONCUSSION.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.221
NO, NO.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.223

( P.A. chatter )

26:36.428 --> 26:39.832
( women chattering )

26:41.500 --> 26:44.303
- EXCUSE ME?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.438
- WHERE AM I?
- ( women laugh )

26:46.538 --> 26:48.841
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.143
- ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

HAS SHE GOT A GREEN BELT ON
OR AM I TWEAKIN'?

27:00.019 --> 27:03.355
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

27:15.401 --> 27:18.738
( seagulls screeching )

27:41.027 --> 27:44.296
( seagulls screeching,
waves crashing )

28:26.505 --> 28:31.343
* BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR

28:33.780 --> 28:38.717
* HAZY FROM ROCKET'S
