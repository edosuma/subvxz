WEBVTT

00:06.341 --> 00:08.134
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:24.335 --> 01:27.172
I need some kind of sign from you.
I need an indication,

01:27.297 --> 01:29.466
- some kind of indication, that you...
- What?

01:29.674 --> 01:31.926
...fully understand the stupidity of this.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.387
REBECCA: I do.
DON: Doesn't feel like it.

01:34.471 --> 01:36.431
How would you like me to behave?

01:36.514 --> 01:40.059
It feels to me... I have to say,
it feels to me like you think this is nuance,

01:40.143 --> 01:42.061
that you think there are layers
that have to be explored.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.104
Why do you say that?

01:43.188 --> 01:45.523
DON: Well, for one thing,
there's four lawyers in the room

01:45.607 --> 01:48.735
billing out at, I don't know.
I'm sure you're worth it.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.196
And you've been here five days.
This is your fifth day.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.823
But that's my point.
Why do we need lawyers who are worth it?

01:53.907 --> 01:56.659
Why do we need lawyers?
Why do we need lawyers?

01:56.743 --> 01:59.204
- You're being sued.
- And you're saying that like it's not insane.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.372
You're saying that like it isn't...

02:05.710 --> 02:06.836
Tell me what I'm missing.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.797
A producer comes up from DC.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.965
He wants to make a name
for himself in New York.

02:11.049 --> 02:14.803
He chases a story that's not there.
And the story, it's not a kitten up a tree.

02:14.886 --> 02:17.972
Chemical weapons, sarin gas on civilians.

02:18.056 --> 02:21.768
He cooks an interview.
He takes a pair of scissors to raw footage.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.269
Of a man on the street?

02:23.353 --> 02:25.730
Of a retired, three-star Marine general.

02:25.897 --> 02:28.858
We go to air.
48 hours it takes for the story to come undone

02:28.942 --> 02:30.276
and with it Atlantis Cable News.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.195
ACN is brought to its knees.

02:32.278 --> 02:35.198
The producer's surgical strike is
discovered and the producer is fired.

02:35.365 --> 02:36.991
Does he write an open letter
to the <i>New York Times,</i>

02:37.075 --> 02:38.660
apologizing to the public, his colleagues,

02:38.743 --> 02:40.787
the three-star general,
and the US Armed Forces?

02:40.870 --> 02:43.623
No, he sues us for wrongful termination.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.334
And I need to know,
I need some kind of sign from you, Rebecca,

02:46.417 --> 02:47.919
because you're obviously, all four of you,

02:48.086 --> 02:50.255
you can't be stupid
and afford haircuts this good.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.758
I need you to tell me
that this is exactly as insane as it is.

02:53.842 --> 02:56.219
I'm afraid I'm going to have to infuriate you.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.972
- Why?
- Because it is nuanced.

02:59.055 --> 03:02.016
He cooked an interview.
He took pruning shears to the raw...

03:02.100 --> 03:05.019
Rebecca, if he doused the studio in kerosene

03:05.103 --> 03:07.772
and lit a tiki torch, it wouldn't have
done as much damage as Genoa,

03:07.856 --> 03:10.441
so where is the complexity?
Where is the nuance?

03:10.984 --> 03:13.903
His claim is he's a scapegoat.

03:13.987 --> 03:15.280
- DON: That's his claim?
- Yeah.

03:15.572 --> 03:18.449
I understand why he'd feel that way,
because it was entirely his fault.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.452
And if it was entirely his fault,
then it's not at all anyone else's.

03:21.619 --> 03:22.954
It was not at all anyone else's.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.539
That's where the plaintiff disagrees.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.958
And if Dantana
was being offered as a sacrifice to the gods...

03:27.125 --> 03:29.752
- Oh, Rebecca.
- And it was an institutional failure

03:29.836 --> 03:31.880
- that led to the airing of Genoa...
- I'm gonna eat this table.

03:31.963 --> 03:36.050
And he is paying the price for
mistakes that were made above him.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.386
This isn't an original story, Don.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.471
- He cooked...
- That's the nuance.

03:40.555 --> 03:43.433
The nuance is he's gonna
leverage the public's inexhaustible love

03:43.516 --> 03:44.809
of big shots falling down.

03:45.101 --> 03:47.061
Charlie, Will, and Mac.

03:47.145 --> 03:48.563
I know how this ends.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.941
Why is it called a red team?

03:55.737 --> 03:57.864
- The blood cells.
- Hmm?

03:58.531 --> 04:00.950
White blood cells attack an infection,
red blood cells clean it up.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.620
You have a group of people
investigating a story, they're the white team.

04:03.703 --> 04:05.622
Other people are purposely
kept out of the loop

04:05.705 --> 04:07.248
so that when the white team
is ready, they can...

04:07.332 --> 04:09.250
- Fresh eyes.
- We're supposed to poke holes in it.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.085
- REBECCA: And were you able to?
- Were we...

04:11.169 --> 04:13.129
The first red team. You,

04:14.923 --> 04:17.175
Jim Harper, Sloan Sabbith.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.927
Was anyone able to poke holes in it?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.763
No. Other than the made-up interview,
it was a solid story.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.264
I'm just asking if you
were able to poke holes in it.

04:23.348 --> 04:25.099
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
What does it matter?

04:25.183 --> 04:26.434
It matters.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.520
It matters because
there were holes in the story, right?

04:29.604 --> 04:31.814
- Yeah.
- Now, Don, a ton of them, right?

04:31.898 --> 04:33.733
- We didn't see the holes because...
- REBECCA: Ah.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.861
That's institutional failure, right?

04:39.697 --> 04:41.240
You don't have to answer that. In fact, don't.

04:41.366 --> 04:42.575
I can.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.870
First red team meeting
was seven months ago.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.288
Charlie wants more evidence.

04:47.372 --> 04:50.458
Second red team meeting,
you have Stomtonovich now.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.002
- Charlie still wants more evidence.
- That's not diligent?

04:53.086 --> 04:55.088
Third red team meeting,
you have Valenzuela now

04:55.171 --> 04:56.839
and Charlie green-lights Genoa.

04:56.923 --> 04:59.467
And I'm asking you,
other than the cooked tape, Mrs. Lincoln,

04:59.550 --> 05:01.094
were there any holes in the story?

05:02.929 --> 05:04.722
- Yes.
- But you didn't find any of them.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.391
We found all of them.

05:06.641 --> 05:07.725
And I grant you it would've been better

05:07.809 --> 05:09.227
if we found them before the story aired.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.771
- You'll grant me that.
- He digitally remastered an interview.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.858
That is the all of it. That's it.
There was no institutional failure.

05:15.942 --> 05:17.568
Where was the third red team meeting?

05:17.902 --> 05:19.988
Where did Charlie give the green light?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.740
It was right in this room.

05:22.824 --> 05:26.202
This is an interview
with Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney,

05:26.285 --> 05:28.997
the first member
of the Genoa crew to come forward.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.249
It was recorded in September of last year.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.459
The third red team meeting, red team three,

05:33.543 --> 05:36.337
we were all walked through
the evidence again.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.965
One, Jerry gets a tip from Cyrus West,

05:39.048 --> 05:41.551
a retired Air Force captain
who had just appeared on <i>News Night</i>

05:41.634 --> 05:42.760
in support of drone strikes.

05:43.011 --> 05:46.931
Cyrus West is known among people I know
as a guy with ambition.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.933
What kind of ambition?

05:49.017 --> 05:51.477
Congress, <i>Dancing With the Stars,</i>
I don't know.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.312
But you have to take
what he said with a salt lick.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.106
Did you warn anyone about that?

05:55.773 --> 05:57.275
I couldn't. I wasn't in the loop.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.943
You also weren't in New York.

05:59.027 --> 06:01.612
I was in New Hampshire
with the Romney campaign at the time.

06:01.696 --> 06:04.032
- Why?
- I was covering for our embed,

06:04.115 --> 06:05.867
a guy named Ben Furusho who'd hurt himself.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.368
- How'd he hurt himself?
- JIM: Ben?

06:07.452 --> 06:09.328
- Yeah.
- Mark is asking did he hurt himself

06:09.412 --> 06:11.122
saving people from a burning building?

06:11.289 --> 06:13.541
No, he got drunk and tried to jump

06:13.624 --> 06:16.419
from his second-floor balcony
into the pool at the Nashua Holiday Inn.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.422
KEN: Were you the only
one available to cover for him?

06:19.505 --> 06:20.631
No.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.675
Were you the only one
qualified to cover for him?

06:22.759 --> 06:23.760
JIM: No.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.511
Who made the decision
you should cover for him?

06:25.595 --> 06:28.389
- I did.
- ROSS: You sent yourself to New Hampshire?

06:28.473 --> 06:30.391
I think you know what
these guys are getting at.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.814
There is a woman I work with.

06:36.898 --> 06:39.942
Maggie Jordan.
We don't have to make this excruciating.

06:40.026 --> 06:41.527
You had a relationship with a coworker.

06:41.611 --> 06:42.612
It wasn't a relationship.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.363
You had something with Maggie,

06:44.447 --> 06:46.532
but she was living with Don
and your heart was a little dinged up,

06:46.616 --> 06:47.867
so you wanted to get out of town for a while

06:47.950 --> 06:49.744
and that's why you weren't
available to do your job,

06:49.827 --> 06:52.080
which at that moment
included saying to MacKenzie,

06:52.163 --> 06:54.040
"Don't trust Cyrus West."

06:54.540 --> 06:55.875
What is it Jerry's counting on?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.086
That you guys don't want
stories like that made public.

06:58.169 --> 06:59.295
Go back to red team three.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.297
Genoa got on the air
because I was distracted?

07:01.380 --> 07:02.381
Go back.

07:04.592 --> 07:09.388
One, Jerry gets the tip from Cyrus West.
The tip leads him to Eric Sweeney. That's two.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.515
JERRY: Here's the Sweeney interview.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.268
JERRY: <i>Would you say your</i>
<i>name, rank, and your last billet?</i>

07:14.352 --> 07:15.728
<i>Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney.</i>

07:16.187 --> 07:19.148
<i>Before my discharge,</i>
<i>I was stationed with a MARSOC unit in J-bad.</i>

07:19.232 --> 07:21.776
JERRY: <i>That's Marine Special Operations</i>
<i>Command in Jalalabad?</i>

07:21.859 --> 07:23.236
ERIC: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

07:23.444 --> 07:26.030
JERRY: <i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>of a black op called Genoa?</i>

07:26.114 --> 07:27.281
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

07:27.365 --> 07:29.700
JERRY: <i>Did you participate in that black op?</i>

07:29.784 --> 07:33.871
This was maybe the hundredth time
I'd seen the Sweeney interview.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.457
Intel had location on two Marine POWs

07:36.541 --> 07:38.960
who'd been separated
from their unit three days earlier

07:39.043 --> 07:41.337
during a firefight in the Hindu Kush.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.422
They'd been smuggled across the border

07:43.506 --> 07:45.633
and the Pakistani Taliban
intended to sell them

07:45.716 --> 07:47.009
for propaganda purposes.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.554
What does "propaganda purposes" mean?

07:49.679 --> 07:51.139
<i>They were gonna be publically beheaded.</i>

07:51.222 --> 07:53.599
<i>And if we didn't get them before they were</i>
<i>moved again, we'd lose them.</i>

07:53.683 --> 07:55.143
Operation Genoa was an extraction.

07:55.226 --> 07:57.395
A MARSOC unit flies in
on a couple of Black Hawks

07:57.478 --> 08:00.231
and grabs our guys,
but the first unit was overrun

08:00.314 --> 08:03.568
and the second unit, the story goes,

08:03.693 --> 08:05.069
dropped sarin gas.

08:05.153 --> 08:06.779
<i>Suddenly I'm tripping over people screaming.</i>

08:06.988 --> 08:09.574
<i>Boils and burns on their bodies.</i>
<i>Some of them passed out.</i>

08:09.657 --> 08:11.075
JERRY: <i>What did you think</i>
<i>was in the missile?</i>

08:11.159 --> 08:14.245
<i>I wasn't sure, but I didn't have time</i>
<i>to think about it until we were out of there.</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:16.789
<i>So later I'm talking to the crew,</i>
<i>I'm asking about the weapons package.</i>

08:16.873 --> 08:18.332
<i>Why'd the white phosphorus do that?</i>

08:18.416 --> 08:19.625
<i>And the guy said it wasn't the Willie Pete.</i>

08:19.709 --> 08:22.920
<i>I said, "What was it?" He said, "Sarin."</i>

08:23.504 --> 08:26.174
NEAL: <i>Will was the only one in the room</i>
<i>who hadn't heard the story before.</i>

08:26.716 --> 08:29.302
I looked over to see
what his first reaction was going to be.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.012
ERIC: <i>And the guy said</i>
<i>it wasn't the Willie Pete.</i>

08:31.095 --> 08:34.348
<i>I said, "What was it?" He said, "Sarin."</i>

08:34.432 --> 08:36.475
NEAL: <i>There was no expression.</i>

08:37.101 --> 08:39.270
Cyrus West, Eric Sweeney, that's one and two.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.689
The tweets from Hamni8 were three.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.733
Four was Leon Deit and the NGO report.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.445
Five was Charlie's source
who handed over the helo manifest.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.198
CHARLIE: This is a list of every
weapon the Black Hawks were carrying,

08:50.281 --> 08:52.867
or at least one of the two Black Hawks.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.118
MX-76.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.747
Five munitions experts
say there's no such thing.

08:57.830 --> 09:01.167
It's what you write in that spot when your
payload is codeword-classified.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.376
That's the sarin.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.670
Charlie's source
was our fifth piece of evidence.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.589
Were you happy with the evidence so far?

09:07.465 --> 09:09.258
- Was I?
- Yeah.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.509
(CHUCKLES)

09:10.927 --> 09:13.888
Rebecca, I run our website.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.474
Yeah, I'm just asking
how you felt about the evidence so far.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.186
I'm not qualified to judge the evidence.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.021
You were on the Genoa team?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.397
- Yeah.
- You were put on the team?

09:23.481 --> 09:24.565
- Yes. Yes.
- Neal.

09:24.649 --> 09:25.733
Don't ever fucking say out loud

09:25.816 --> 09:27.318
that you are unqualified
to judge the evidence.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.694
- Wait...
- Don't ever say it again.

09:28.778 --> 09:31.155
I was absolutely qualified
to chase the Hamni8 tweets,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.824
- which was my job on the team.
- I get that. You get that.

09:34.075 --> 09:36.327
They get that. Let's quit while we're ahead.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.248
Five was Charlie's source
with the helo manifest.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.375
Six was Stomtonovich.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.419
JERRY: <i>At the time of Genoa,</i>
<i>we still had sarin gas. Is that right?</i>

09:45.503 --> 09:47.421
STOMTONOVICH: <i>Yes, we did.</i>
JERRY: <i>You're sure of this?</i>

09:47.630 --> 09:51.592
STOMTONOVICH: <i>We had sarin gas</i>
<i>at the time of Genoa and we have sarin today.</i>

09:51.676 --> 09:54.095
JERRY: <i>According to the OPCW,</i>
<i>the US was scheduled</i>

09:54.178 --> 09:57.348
<i>to have completed</i>
<i>its destruction of chemical weapons by 2007.</i>

09:57.431 --> 09:58.599
STOMTONOVICH:
<i>The US missed that deadline.</i>

09:58.683 --> 09:59.934
Stop the tape, please.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.021
What are we gonna do
about the basketball game?

10:04.480 --> 10:05.481
We'll blur it out.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.441
Why was the interview conducted
in front of a game?

10:07.525 --> 10:10.736
- He wanted it on.
- Why not move his chair?

10:10.820 --> 10:12.613
I wanted the Marine paraphernalia in the shot,

10:12.697 --> 10:14.532
but to get that,
I couldn't frame out the screen,

10:14.615 --> 10:17.118
which I knew I could take out later.
Is this important?

10:20.830 --> 10:22.540
NEAL: <i>Still no reaction from Will.</i>

10:22.873 --> 10:25.376
Stomtonovich was six
and then Valenzuela was seven.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.296
I conducted the interview with
Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela

10:28.379 --> 10:31.382
on August 22, the day before yesterday.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.175
- Here it is.
- (KEYBOARD CLICKS)

10:33.259 --> 10:35.428
MACKENZIE: <i>Did you use gas on the mission?</i>

10:36.554 --> 10:38.264
SLOAN: Valenzuela, the crew chief on board

10:38.347 --> 10:41.225
one of the two MARSOC helos,
confirms everything we've been told by West,

10:41.350 --> 10:42.852
Sweeney, and Stomtonovich,

10:43.227 --> 10:45.980
all of which is consistent
with the tweets from Hamni8,

10:46.063 --> 10:49.066
the Leon Deit report
and Charlie's source with the helo manifest.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.027
The presentation is over

10:51.110 --> 10:53.404
and Will's just heard
everything for the first time.

10:53.487 --> 10:57.199
This is what's been happening
for the last 11 months.

10:57.283 --> 10:58.993
Yeah, I had a hunch.

10:59.577 --> 11:00.995
You did?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.542
I heard the same story.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.466
SLOAN: <i>That came as kind of a shock</i>
<i>to everybody.</i>

11:13.716 --> 11:16.177
Like Charlie's source,
Will was only able to identify

11:16.260 --> 11:18.846
him or her as reliable
and in a position to know.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.014
At that moment...

11:20.097 --> 11:22.016
I know what you're gonna ask
and it doesn't matter.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.352
Sloan, at that moment,
did anyone in the room...

11:24.435 --> 11:26.604
You've got everyone,
you've got the president of the news division,

11:26.687 --> 11:29.190
the editor and anchor in chief, the EP,

11:29.273 --> 11:30.983
- senior producer, staff.
- It didn't matter.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.235
Did anyone at that moment think to ask

11:33.319 --> 11:36.364
if Charlie's source
and Will's source were the same person?

11:37.656 --> 11:38.866
It didn't matter.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.201
- Did anyone...
- It was already a go.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.702
Will's source was just extra.

11:41.786 --> 11:45.289
It didn't make you feel more confident
that Will had heard it, too?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.627
- Yes.
- Did anyone ask?

11:51.587 --> 11:52.755
No.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.510
How many more times
did you review the evidence?

11:57.635 --> 11:58.677
I'm not sure.

11:58.761 --> 12:02.014
We went through
the whole thing maybe four more times.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.307
I'm ready to say go.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.851
You know how I feel.

12:05.935 --> 12:06.977
- I'm convinced.
- I'm not.

12:07.061 --> 12:08.062
- I know.
- Mac.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.647
Tell me why.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.900
It just doesn't feel right.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.861
11 months of reporting versus your gut?
I'll take the reporting.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.447
- I'd take Jim's gut.
- Me, too.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.491
You worship at the altar of logic and reason.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.494
And I don't believe this many people
could keep something like this a secret.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.454
- Well, they didn't.
- Jerry, I know these guys.

12:25.538 --> 12:28.416
Due respect, Jim,
but you fetishize these guys.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.709
Two million men and women
in the armed services.

12:30.835 --> 12:32.336
You were embedded with a couple of units.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.296
- You know a few of these guys.
- Hang on.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.424
I don't think it's fetishizing to admire people

12:36.507 --> 12:38.551
who signed up to fight
a couple of wars that neither one of us

12:38.634 --> 12:41.262
wanted to dirty our hands with,
but I do give them the benefit of the doubt.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.347
I gave them the benefit of the doubt, too,
until I saw pictures

12:43.431 --> 12:45.266
of what's-her-name doing the "get this" pose

12:45.349 --> 12:48.310
next to prisoners in dog collars
wired to car batteries.

12:48.394 --> 12:49.603
It doesn't feel right?

12:49.687 --> 12:53.065
We've tortured, drowned, wiretapped,
renditioned, and suspended due process,

12:53.190 --> 12:55.985
but you think we drew a moral
and legal line someplace?

12:56.068 --> 12:57.778
- Are you one of the Andrews Sisters?
- MACKENZIE: All right.

12:57.862 --> 12:59.113
It doesn't feel right because...

12:59.196 --> 13:01.115
It doesn't feel right
because I was the one leading the team.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.783
I'm sure that's not what Jim was gonna say.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.368
No, it's exactly what I was going to say.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.328
What's your concern with me?

13:06.412 --> 13:08.080
My concern is that I don't know you.

13:08.164 --> 13:09.248
Well, that's a lame reason.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.834
No, right now he's being paid to be skeptical.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.502
JERRY: I didn't show up one day.

13:13.586 --> 13:15.796
I've been working
at the DC bureau for eight years.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.466
We may be the ugly stepsister,
but it worked for you, too, Charlie.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.759
- MACKENZIE: Don.
- When Jim doesn't feel good about a story,

13:20.843 --> 13:22.595
I take it seriously.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.097
But I have another concern
which Mac and I talked about last March.

13:25.181 --> 13:27.516
- Do you remember this?
- Yeah. Safety.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.143
Isn't there a chance
we're putting soldiers in danger?

13:29.226 --> 13:30.644
- Yes.
- DON: Even rioting.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.980
Plus the "get this" pictures
with the dog collars

13:33.063 --> 13:35.608
was the single best recruiting tool
al-Qaeda's ever had.

13:35.691 --> 13:38.736
You're saying don't run a story
about the use of chemical weapons

13:38.819 --> 13:40.529
- because it might be dangerous?
- I am.

13:40.613 --> 13:42.990
But the chemical weapons,
they're not dangerous?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.325
I'm saying the needs of the many...

13:44.408 --> 13:45.659
It's the protests
that we should be worried about?

13:45.743 --> 13:47.828
I also think we should consider
there's an election going on.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.663
You think we shouldn't run it
until after November?

13:49.747 --> 13:51.332
I think we should wait until we're sure.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.083
We are sure. You just don't like the story.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.419
"It is illegal to develop, produce,

13:55.586 --> 13:58.589
"otherwise acquire,
transfer directly or indirectly,

13:58.672 --> 14:02.009
"receive, stockpile, retain,
own, possess, or use

14:02.092 --> 14:04.637
"or threaten to use any chemical weapon.

14:04.762 --> 14:07.973
"Any person who violates
section 229 of this title

14:08.057 --> 14:10.809
"and by whose action the death
of another person is the result

14:10.893 --> 14:13.270
"shall be punished by death
or imprisoned for life."

14:13.354 --> 14:16.524
That's not the Geneva Conventions,
that's US federal law.

14:17.358 --> 14:18.859
Whose case are you arguing?

14:18.943 --> 14:22.696
I'm just making sure
we know what we're accusing these guys of.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.783
Who, by the way,
rescued two Marines while taking heavy fire.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.035
If these guys are charged,
there could be riots here at home, too.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.496
- God, Don, just stay in your house.
- Okay.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.128
Will?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.842
He sat there a long time before he said...

14:52.977 --> 14:55.062
I trust Charlie and Mac.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.106
All right, we're going.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.191
Lock it down.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.240
HERB: <i>15 seconds. Stand by roll-in.</i>

15:06.323 --> 15:07.575
- Stand by.
- Standing.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.076
- G118.
- Standing.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.370
- Ready roll-in.
- Here we go, Will.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.581
And roll in.

15:13.831 --> 15:14.832
(MUSIC PLAYING)

15:23.674 --> 15:26.719
<i>We've been at war with al-Qaeda and its allies</i>
<i>for over 10 years.</i>

15:27.052 --> 15:31.181
War demands sacrifice.
Sometimes of liberty, sometimes of livelihood

15:31.265 --> 15:32.891
and sometimes of life.

15:33.017 --> 15:35.269
But does it require us
to abandon the principles

15:35.352 --> 15:39.356
for which we're fighting and inch by inch
resemble more the enemy we fight?

15:39.815 --> 15:44.820
As Alfred Adler once said, "It is easier to fight
for one's principles than to live up to them."

15:44.945 --> 15:48.616
This is <i>ACN Reports</i> and tonight
we tell you the story of Operation Genoa,

15:48.699 --> 15:51.619
a made-for-Hollywood tale
of a daring rescue mission.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.413
It's to you to decide
if the mission was a success.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.875
<i>Our report begins with a firefight</i>
<i>in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:00.377
<i>that separated two Marines</i>
<i>from their pinned-down unit.</i>

16:00.461 --> 16:01.879
HERB: <i>Go three.</i>

16:01.962 --> 16:04.923
JERRY: <i>The mountains of the Hindu Kush</i>
<i>have been violent tribal areas</i>

16:05.049 --> 16:09.345
<i>since before Alexander the Great</i>
<i>marched through Persia on his way to India.</i>

16:09.428 --> 16:13.766
<i>On one dangerous night in March 2009,</i>
<i>two young Marines were on patrol...</i>

16:13.849 --> 16:16.810
<i>Intelligence they were gonna be smuggled</i>
<i>across the border by Pakistani Taliban.</i>

16:16.894 --> 16:19.480
<i>- And what else did the intelligence tell you?</i>
<i>- There was a ticking clock.</i>

16:19.563 --> 16:21.565
<i>We knew they were gonna be sold</i>
<i>for propaganda purposes.</i>

16:21.732 --> 16:23.233
<i>- Sold to al-Qaeda?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

16:23.317 --> 16:24.860
- SLOAN: <i>In a matter of days?</i>
<i>- Hours, really.</i>

16:24.943 --> 16:27.988
According to the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons...

16:28.072 --> 16:31.075
HERB: Ready 17. Stand by 19 through 22A.

16:31.659 --> 16:32.743
Standing.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.120
<i>But we sat down with</i>
<i>a Marine three-star general,</i>

16:35.245 --> 16:38.707
<i>an expert in chemical weapons</i>
<i>with knowledge of Operation Genoa.</i>

16:39.083 --> 16:42.127
<i>At his request, we blacked out his face</i>
<i>and electronically altered his voice.</i>

16:42.211 --> 16:43.212
HERB: Go 17.

16:43.671 --> 16:45.005
JERRY: <i>According to the OPCW,</i>

16:45.089 --> 16:47.132
<i>the US was scheduled to have</i>
<i>completed its destruction</i>

16:47.216 --> 16:49.218
<i>of chemical weapons by 2007.</i>

16:49.301 --> 16:51.053
STOMTONOVICH:
<i>The US missed that deadline.</i>

16:51.136 --> 16:54.682
<i>They extended it to 2012</i>
<i>and they missed that deadline, too.</i>

16:54.807 --> 16:57.976
<i>At the time of Genoa,</i>
<i>we destroyed at least 87%...</i>

16:58.102 --> 17:01.355
<i>We asked if any exceptional</i>
<i>measures were used in the operation.</i>

17:01.438 --> 17:04.566
STOMTONOVICH:
<i>Exceptional measures were called for.</i>

17:04.733 --> 17:07.152
WILL: <i>We asked if sarin gas was used.</i>

17:08.278 --> 17:09.905
STOMTONOVICH: <i>We used sarin.</i>

17:10.364 --> 17:12.408
WILL: <i>A crew chief from the operation</i>
<i>speaks to us</i>

17:12.491 --> 17:15.244
<i>when</i> ACN Reports <i>returns right after this.</i>

17:32.845 --> 17:34.638
<i>What are your duties as crew chief?</i>

17:34.722 --> 17:36.807
<i>I'm in charge of the crew and the equipment.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:39.143
<i>Do you oversee the loading</i>
<i>of the helicopter, the payload?</i>

17:39.560 --> 17:42.813
<i>Yes, during preflight,</i>
<i>I'd be responsible for the payload.</i>

17:50.571 --> 17:52.489
(INAUDIBLE)

18:20.517 --> 18:23.937
<i>...being roughly 7,500 tons of sarin.</i>

18:24.104 --> 18:27.107
The Pentagon declined
our request for an interview.

18:27.191 --> 18:31.278
For everyone at <i>ACN Reports,</i>
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

18:38.494 --> 18:39.995
Are you here for a call?

18:40.078 --> 18:42.039
Congratulations?

18:42.122 --> 18:45.375
General Stomtonovich.
Charlie, he's screaming.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.216
He says he never said they used sarin.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.300
It's on film.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.594
- He says he never said that.
- It's on film.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.180
- I knew this would happen.
- It happens all the time.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.683
These guys get cold feet
or someone at the DOD begs them to recant.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.768
What's he saying we did?

19:03.060 --> 19:04.311
Edited him out of context.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.146
- Did you tell him we have the raw footage?
- Yeah.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.273
Raw footage isn't edited out of context.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.150
- It isn't edited at all.
- CHARLIE: I told him that.

19:10.234 --> 19:13.028
- What did he say?
- He said he was gonna kill me.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.697
Did he say it the way Mac says it to me
or did it seem like he meant it?

19:15.823 --> 19:18.242
- I mean it when I say it to you.
- CHARLIE: He was very upset.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.410
Tell him I'm gonna go right now
to look at the raw interview again

19:20.494 --> 19:22.287
and that he can look at it with me if he wants.

19:22.746 --> 19:23.914
All right.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.124
- We knew things were gonna happen.
- MACKENZIE: Yeah.

19:26.250 --> 19:30.504
Chemical weapons expert wants to kill me.
I make the worst enemies.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.131
Seriously, I'm a perfectly nice guy.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.842
(EXCITED CHATTER)

19:35.425 --> 19:36.677
People are celebrating out there.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.555
- Yeah, I'm coming out.
- Who's playing?

19:39.763 --> 19:42.224
WILL: The California Golden Bears
are hosting the UCLA Bruins.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.810
You'll watch anything, won't you?

19:45.435 --> 19:46.520
Yeah.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.316
MACKENZIE: Why are there two clocks?

19:52.943 --> 19:54.736
One's the game clock
and one's the play clock.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.864
The game clock is showing
how much time is left in the quarter

19:56.947 --> 19:59.575
and the play clock shows
how much time is left to get off the play.

19:59.658 --> 20:01.535
They only have a certain amount of
time to complete the play?

20:01.618 --> 20:03.704
They only have a certain amount of time
to start the play.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.706
Don't have that rule in soccer.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.207
They don't have any rules in soccer.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.376
That's why you think a game
that ends in a zero-zero tie

20:09.459 --> 20:10.711
- is a gamely fought match.
- It's called nil-nil.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.588
I was trying to keep it from being worse.

20:12.671 --> 20:13.922
I was helping you out.

20:15.340 --> 20:19.094
Do any other sports have enforced pacing?
Does baseball?

20:19.219 --> 20:22.347
No, pitchers commonly
go for a sandwich between pitches.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.394
Golf, you can be penalized for slow play.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.647
Hockey, you can hang onto the puck
for as long as you want,

20:30.731 --> 20:33.025
but before too long a guy
named Lars is gonna hurt you.

20:33.108 --> 20:36.445
Basketball has a shot clock.
You've got 24 seconds

20:36.528 --> 20:38.447
to put up a shot, or in college it's 35.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.282
Tennis, you can lose a point for slow play.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.575
- Listen.
- Yeah.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.785
Should we be worried about
the Stomtonovich call?

20:44.661 --> 20:46.997
- It's on film.
- Okay.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.917
I'm gonna look at it again now.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.002
Go Bruins! Beat the Golden Bears.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.339
Beat them as hard as you can.
Beat them with impunity!

20:55.422 --> 20:58.133
- You have no idea what you're saying.
- MACKENZIE: I know.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.804
- DON: We thought the DOD would have...
- I thought.

21:04.264 --> 21:08.852
I thought the DOD would have a response
on their website by midnight.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.313
But by 6:00 a.m.
we hadn't heard anything yet.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.940
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Come on in.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.025
Excuse me.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.322
- You guys have met?
- We have.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.157
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.788
She says she never heard
Stomtonovich say it happened.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.873
- Then that's what it is.
- Even in her condition?

21:29.957 --> 21:32.793
- Hmm?
- You'd take her word for it in her condition?

21:32.876 --> 21:34.920
In the condition she was in
when they did the interview?

21:35.003 --> 21:38.131
She's not in a condition,
and yes, I'd take her word for it.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.967
If she wasn't sure, she'd say she wasn't sure.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.844
On the witness stand,
that's not gonna sound like honorable loyalty.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.554
It's gonna sound like you're
willing to believe anybody

21:44.680 --> 21:45.681
as long as you slept with them.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.186
This is the very last polling data
taken before the polls open tomorrow.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.813
Who's gonna win?

21:53.230 --> 21:54.856
The President will be reelected.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.484
But Tulsi Gabbard's gonna
win in Hawaii's second.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.236
She'll be the first Samoan in Congress.

21:59.361 --> 22:03.949
And Kerry Bentivolio is gonna take the seat
vacated by Thaddeus McCotter,

22:04.074 --> 22:07.494
who came out with my pick
for the best resignation statement of all time.

22:08.412 --> 22:11.623
"The recent event's totalities of
calumnies, indignities and deceits

22:11.707 --> 22:13.583
"have weighed most heavily upon my family.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.420
"Thus, acutely aware
one cannot rebuild their hearth

22:16.503 --> 22:18.839
"among the ruins of their US House office,

22:18.922 --> 22:21.591
"for the sake of my loved ones,
I must strike another match,

22:21.675 --> 22:24.636
"go start anew by embracing the promotion

22:24.761 --> 22:27.139
"back from public servant
to sovereign citizen."

22:28.557 --> 22:30.517
Sounds like he and his friends
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

22:30.600 --> 22:34.646
are about to take a journey by sea to ask the
Duke of Verona for his most kind blessing.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.023
(LAUGHS)

22:36.106 --> 22:37.441
I like you, Keefer.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.359
My trust in Maggie

22:40.193 --> 22:42.612
has nothing to do with anything
but the right things.

22:43.989 --> 22:46.450
6:00 a.m., you hadn't heard from the DOD.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.452
7:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., nothing.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.704
- REBECCA: Maybe they hadn't seen the show.
- They see the Internet.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.205
This was Monday morning, September 10.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.457
DON: Yeah.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.251
You had another story creeping up on you.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.253
Nobody knew that yet.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.673
Everybody below the producer level
has to take a shift doing the book.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.592
That morning it was Neal's turn.

23:03.675 --> 23:04.968
What's the book?

23:05.469 --> 23:07.554
- KENDRA: Neal.
- (SIGHS)

23:07.929 --> 23:10.057
NEAL: It seems like it's my turn
more often than it should be.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.224
Man up.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.851
I'm always manned up.
That's my default mode.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.227
Then go into ultra man mode.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.563
The women here couldn't deal
with my ultra man mode.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.356
Probably not. Are you gonna take this?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.441
- It's heavy.
- (SIGHS)

23:23.070 --> 23:25.447
- Intern. Come on over.
- Yes?

23:28.241 --> 23:30.535
This is the overnight book.

23:30.619 --> 23:34.122
The night crew puts together every story
and every press release from everywhere.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.374
Go through this and separate
it into four piles,

23:36.458 --> 23:39.086
knew that, didn't know that,
don't care, and Shakira.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.338
- But that one's just for me, all right?
- MACKENZIE: Neal.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.760
- There's no statement yet.
- I know.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.178
It's the Pentagon.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.430
Is it possible they've responded
in a secret corner of the Internet?

23:50.514 --> 23:51.598
Secret corner of the Internet?

23:51.681 --> 23:54.226
Slay a dungeon wizard
to get the keys to Mordor or something?

23:54.351 --> 23:56.353
- It's not possible.
- Something that we need that Dumbledore...

23:56.478 --> 23:58.522
- Listen to yourself.
- I know, it's getting worse as I go on.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.482
- And it didn't start in a great place.
- Nothing in the book?

24:00.565 --> 24:01.650
Well, there are gonna be a ton of things

24:01.733 --> 24:02.776
in the book, but not from the Pentagon.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.486
I thought on the off chance
someone got a quote from them.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.404
- We'd know about it.
- Obviously I'm grasping at straws, Neal.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.739
There's no call to be patronizing.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.699
- You're right.
- Thank you.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.743
- Well, you're not, 'cause Mordor...
- I'm not the expert.

24:11.827 --> 24:12.786
You don't say.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.538
Do the book
and don't just farm it out to an intern.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.123
I'm delegating.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.296
- Fast Nationals?
- Right here.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.965
Just tell me if the number begins with a three.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.467
- It doesn't.
- 2.9?

24:27.551 --> 24:28.552
2.7?

24:28.927 --> 24:31.054
5.8 million viewers.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.641
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's gonna double

24:34.724 --> 24:37.060
when they add live-plus-same-day
and live-plus-seven.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.353
- Jesus Christ!
- Congratulations.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.021
Congratulations, man!

24:40.105 --> 24:41.773
Tracking looked good, but not like this.

24:41.857 --> 24:43.942
That's an <i>I Love Lucy</i> number.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.152
(LAUGHS)

24:46.570 --> 24:47.696
Yes.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.781
Yes. What?

24:49.865 --> 24:52.242
Don't worry about the call from Stomtonovich.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.451
I'm not.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.287
I am a little bit and I'll tell you why.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.206
He didn't sound like a guy with cold feet.
He was certain of what he said

24:58.290 --> 25:01.084
and he said it
to me three times the exact same way.

25:01.293 --> 25:05.005
There was one camera, no cuts.
He's not a young guy. It all happened fast.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.507
He's thinking about the size of it
for the first time now.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.385
Yes. Yeah.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.637
The size of it.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.557
A new story creeping up on us?

25:15.640 --> 25:19.102
REBECCA: The morning of September 10.
The day after the broadcast.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.438
It was Neal's turn to do the overnight book,

25:21.521 --> 25:24.149
- but he staffed it out to an intern.
- Jenna Johnson.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.527
Are you talking about Benghazi?

25:29.237 --> 25:30.572
Anything?

25:30.655 --> 25:32.949
Jerry Brown's challenged
Chris Christie to a race.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.034
Sponsored by HeartBlast,

25:34.117 --> 25:36.244
a new defibrillator company
from the people who brought you...

25:36.328 --> 25:38.955
Piers Morgan and Rihanna
had a Twitter fight about her haircut.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.333
I'll give you $100 if you go pitch that to Will.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.085
I know you're not gonna
think this one's important, but it is.

25:44.169 --> 25:45.503
<i>- Star Magazine...</i>
- Nope.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.715
...is reporting that a palace source confirmed
that Kate Middleton is pregnant.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.885
- That's news I want to hear.
- You just did. Anything else?

25:52.636 --> 25:54.221
Lady Gaga showed a lot of cleavage

25:54.304 --> 25:57.057
- at an after-party for the Paralympic Games.
- Put that one aside.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.477
- Oh, and Terry Jones the Florida pastor?
- Yeah.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.897
He's screening the trailer to a movie
called <i>Innocence of Muslims.</i>

26:03.980 --> 26:05.482
- We thought...
- REBECCA: I thought.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.111
I thought, everyone thought

26:10.195 --> 26:12.739
that when the DOD posted its response,
it would be vague.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.700
"Pentagon doesn't comment
on classified operations,

26:15.784 --> 26:17.702
"but we have serious problems with the story

26:17.827 --> 26:20.497
"aired by Atlantis Cable News last night."
Something like that.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.667
You know the reason it was
taking them so long to respond?

26:24.042 --> 26:25.168
No.

26:25.252 --> 26:27.587
They were bringing a lawyer
into the Pentagon press office.

26:27.879 --> 26:31.007
- Pentagon counsel?
- And another lawyer.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.342
Matlock?

26:32.425 --> 26:35.387
The Attorney General.
They weren't fucking around.

26:42.811 --> 26:43.812
(COMPUTER CHIMES)

27:09.963 --> 27:11.548
We knew there'd be pushback.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.929
SLOAN: <i>But not like that.</i>

27:18.346 --> 27:20.682
"We are considering any
and all legal remedies

27:20.765 --> 27:23.727
"available to us including
under the Espionage Act.

27:24.394 --> 27:27.480
"In the interim, we will begin
declassifying documents

27:27.564 --> 27:29.899
"to prove the falsity of ACN's claims."

27:30.191 --> 27:33.695
If I'm a lawyer in that room,
I don't write that response unless I'm sure.

27:33.778 --> 27:34.904
We were sure.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.157
Still? It's noon, Monday.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.702
Charlie got everyone together
in the conference room.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.788
<i>He polled everyone to see</i>
<i>if they were still standing by the story.</i>

27:56.176 --> 27:58.720
<i>People were resolved.</i>

27:58.803 --> 28:00.680
<i>Jim had already said his piece.</i>

28:00.764 --> 28:03.183
<i>His job was to support Mac now,</i>
<i>and that's what he was doing.</i>

28:03.266 --> 28:05.060
REBECCA: <i>At the expense of good advice?</i>

28:05.435 --> 28:06.853
He'd given his advice.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.606
And Charlie, Mac, and Will
had given their instructions.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.858
Of course they pushed back.
What do we expect them to...

28:11.941 --> 28:14.611
"Well, you caught us. Bravo to you, sirs.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.613
"We'll walk ourselves
over to Leavenworth now."

28:17.864 --> 28:20.909
You know at some point at Little Bighorn,
I'll bet Custer led a unanimous vote

28:20.992 --> 28:23.161
where everyone said,
"I still think we can win."

28:23.286 --> 28:25.455
Then came Elliot's show that night.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.791
You know, Elliot was really
the only guy on the team

28:27.916 --> 28:30.377
who hadn't gotten dirty with Genoa yet.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.128
So we dropped dirt on him.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.588
Go.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.340
SLOAN: <i>The second MARSOC team</i>
<i>dropped sarin?</i>

28:35.423 --> 28:37.050
<i>- Yes.</i>
- SLOAN: <i>You're sure?</i>

28:37.133 --> 28:39.427
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- That's why you wore the MOPP suits?</i>

28:39.511 --> 28:42.263
<i>That's why we wore the MOPP suits</i>
<i>and that's why civilians died.</i>

28:42.347 --> 28:45.100
ELLIOT: <i>That was another clip from</i>
<i>last night's</i> ACN Reports,

28:45.183 --> 28:48.686
the startling and provocative story
of the extraction of two captured Marines.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.022
<i>Joining us by satellite</i>
<i>from Trenton, New Jersey,</i>

28:51.106 --> 28:53.650
<i>is former Marine Gunnery Sergeant</i>
<i>Eric Sweeney,</i>

28:53.775 --> 28:56.236
<i>a member of the MARSOC team</i>
<i>that executed the extraction,</i>

28:56.319 --> 28:57.404
<i>which was codenamed Genoa,</i>

28:57.487 --> 29:01.282
<i>and I should say the first member of the team</i>
<i>to step forward and tell his story.</i>

29:01.366 --> 29:02.742
<i>- Welcome, Mr. Sweeney.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

29:02.826 --> 29:05.662
Let's start there. What made you come
forward and speak to the press?

29:05.787 --> 29:08.415
<i>I wish I could say it was honorable.</i>
<i>It was a guilty conscience.</i>

29:08.498 --> 29:10.208
- Guilty that...
<i>- I knew what we'd done.</i>

29:10.792 --> 29:13.878
"Any and all legal remedies."
Is that something they usually say?

29:13.962 --> 29:16.005
DON: They said it when the SEAL
released his bin Laden book.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.550
- They haven't charged him.
- The Espionage Act?

29:18.716 --> 29:21.511
Do you know how many journalists have ever
been tried under the Espionage Act?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.846
- None.
- Good.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.848
'Cause you wouldn't make it in jail, Don.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.435
I'd survive, but you wouldn't.
In fact, I'd thrive.

29:28.518 --> 29:29.602
How do you figure?

29:29.686 --> 29:31.396
<i>- Shawshank.</i>
- (LAUGHS)

29:32.272 --> 29:34.149
I'd do everybody's taxes
and invest the warden's money.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.568
What are you gonna do?
Produce their nightly news show?

29:36.693 --> 29:39.446
- Is this our sound or his?
- His. We're good.

29:39.529 --> 29:40.822
ERIC: <i>We want to be a force multiplier</i>

29:40.905 --> 29:42.907
<i>where one of us</i>
<i>can do the work of several infantrymen.</i>

29:42.991 --> 29:47.162
"The charge that US Special Operations
used sarin gas is absolutely false."

29:47.245 --> 29:50.874
I don't know. Absolutely?
Why not just say "false"?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.625
"Absolutely" sounds like
the kind of word you use...

29:52.709 --> 29:54.711
This isn't like the time
Chip left you a message in eighth grade

29:54.794 --> 29:57.881
and you and your friends did a lab analysis
to figure out if it meant he liked you.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.344
Chet was his name

30:03.428 --> 30:05.805
and sometimes boys are vague
with their messages.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.140
ELLIOT: <i>Was that the first time</i>

30:07.223 --> 30:09.100
<i>that you had to perform a medical procedure</i>
<i>in action?</i>

30:09.893 --> 30:11.102
Move him back to Genoa when you can.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.980
<i>We have advanced combat medicine</i>
<i>as part of our training.</i>

30:14.063 --> 30:17.066
<i>The first time I had to use it, we were</i>
<i>on a mission to pay some tribal leaders...</i>

30:17.150 --> 30:18.693
I don't know what he's talking about anymore.

30:18.776 --> 30:21.446
<i>We hit two IEDs and my Humvee blew apart</i>

30:21.571 --> 30:24.073
<i>and three of us sustained TBIs,</i>
<i>traumatic brain injuries.</i>

30:24.449 --> 30:26.201
<i>And I was dragging a friend of mine...</i>

30:26.284 --> 30:28.119
Did he say "us"?

30:28.745 --> 30:31.664
He said "the three of us."
Traumatic brain injury. He said that.

30:31.748 --> 30:32.874
- TBI?
- I heard it.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.293
Sergeant, did you say that you
sustained a traumatic brain injury?

30:36.377 --> 30:38.630
- Well, it wasn't serious.
- Get out.

30:38.713 --> 30:41.591
<i>- Did you disclose that information to the...</i>
- Get out!

30:41.674 --> 30:43.426
Okay, we've got to go to break,

30:43.885 --> 30:48.515
<i>but we're coming back with Eric Sweeney,</i>
<i>a MARSOC on Operation Genoa.</i>

30:48.598 --> 30:50.308
<i>This is</i> Right Now.

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

31:04.614 --> 31:06.533
(RINGING)

31:08.409 --> 31:09.702
I saw it.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.748
There's a problem with the story.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.500
WILL: <i>I know.</i>

31:20.171 --> 31:21.756
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

31:24.842 --> 31:26.344
All right.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.680
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

31:28.805 --> 31:31.766
And I'm sorry I'm late.
There was a deer on the Merritt Parkway.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.394
The deer ran across
and the car two in front of me hit it.

31:34.477 --> 31:36.771
- Was everyone all right?
- Yeah.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.231
Mac.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.191
Why didn't we know about the TBI?

31:40.275 --> 31:42.235
Everybody listen, okay?
Believe me, I cornered him...

31:42.318 --> 31:43.987
We knew he had two Purple Hearts.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.822
I got him on the phone in Trenton as soon...

31:45.905 --> 31:49.075
Just back up. We'll do this step by step.
He had two Purple Hearts.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.952
The medical information
is sealed and classified.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.830
He told us one is for a shrapnel wound
in his left shoulder

31:53.913 --> 31:56.374
sustained during an ambush
during his first tour in '08.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.376
- The second is...
- The second, he told us,

31:58.501 --> 32:00.670
was for a stab wound
in his leg he got while trying

32:00.753 --> 32:03.631
to subdue an angry teenage militant
in Kapisa Province.

32:03.715 --> 32:05.091
That's the one he was lying about.

32:05.174 --> 32:07.176
The second Purple Heart was for the TBI.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.721
- He showed us the knife wound.
- I asked him about that, too.

32:09.846 --> 32:11.764
He got it in his kitchen trying to open a CD.

32:12.223 --> 32:17.103
He didn't tell us about the TBI
because he didn't think we'd believe his story.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.771
JIM: Isn't that another way of saying

32:18.855 --> 32:21.357
he wanted to tell the Genoa story
so badly he lied?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.985
Well, so why would he lie
about a story that wasn't true?

32:24.068 --> 32:25.695
What's the biggest effect of a TBI?

32:25.862 --> 32:28.531
- I get that it's memory loss.
- It's memory loss.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.742
And it's dizziness and speech deficits.

32:30.825 --> 32:33.453
We didn't see any of those
in the hundred hours we spent with him.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.163
I don't understand.
So at least he doesn't have

32:35.246 --> 32:36.914
all the symptoms of a traumatic brain injury?

32:36.998 --> 32:41.085
GI Jim, what percentage of soldiers
taken to Walter Reed have a TBI?

32:41.169 --> 32:42.587
- A lot.
- It's 30%.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.048
So we're not gonna listen
to a third of wounded vets?

32:45.131 --> 32:47.592
We made this one a key witness
in an accusation of murder.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.010
He lied about an injury

32:49.093 --> 32:51.262
and the injury's number one symptom
is memory loss.

32:51.346 --> 32:52.347
Bring him up from Trenton.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.769
I'll do a pre-interview myself
and if I'm satisfied,

32:57.852 --> 33:00.396
I can put him through a direct examination
on the air and clean this up.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.775
Yeah, and can I just remind everybody
Sweeney's not our only witness.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.526
We've got Stomtonovich and Valenzuela.

33:05.610 --> 33:08.988
Two more witnesses, only 50% of whom
are recanting what they said.

33:09.072 --> 33:10.573
Stomtonovich can recant all he wants.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.784
We have the unedited tape
and Jerry and Maggie were there.

33:12.950 --> 33:13.951
Mmm-hmm.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.703
For the record, I wasn't.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.121
Wasn't what?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.668
I was sent out of the room
before the interview started.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.753
- Good. Let's get it all out now.
- Why?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.922
You and Charlie told him
it was going to be Jerry.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.882
You didn't tell him an AP was coming along.

33:27.965 --> 33:31.094
He had had me investigated, but not Maggie,
so he didn't feel comfortable...

33:31.177 --> 33:33.262
- You were the only one in the room with him?
- Yeah, I was.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.014
- And I see what's happening here.
- Nothing's happening.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.265
Can I bring something else up?

33:36.349 --> 33:39.644
We aired the story 27 hours ago,
so, yeah, now's the time.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.521
We aborted the interview
with Sweeney tonight.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.064
- I did.
- Uh, I did.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.732
- Should you have?
- I don't know.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.901
I was suddenly in a position
where I was asking questions

33:46.984 --> 33:49.195
I didn't know the answers to
about our own story.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.489
If it hadn't been our own story,
wouldn't you have kept going?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.491
"Did you disclose that
to the Genoa producers?

33:53.825 --> 33:57.120
"No? You lied? How has a TBI for which
you received a Purple Heart..."

33:57.203 --> 33:59.747
Yes, he would have kept going.
I shut him down.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.457
- It was live air.
- That doesn't make us look great.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.835
Looking great wasn't
one of their options right then.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.462
Everybody knock it off!

34:06.629 --> 34:08.548
Sister Mary Mother of God.

34:08.631 --> 34:11.884
We have a problem. That's all it is.

34:11.968 --> 34:14.387
We're not gonna have a fucking scrum!

34:16.139 --> 34:19.225
What do we have? What?

34:19.475 --> 34:22.895
A retired Marine general
started getting calls from his buddies.

34:22.979 --> 34:24.397
"What the hell is going on?"

34:24.480 --> 34:26.107
His voice was altered. His face was blacked.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.152
There are six people
who have the information he has

34:29.277 --> 34:31.487
and generals don't have dumb friends.

34:31.571 --> 34:32.989
What else?

34:33.114 --> 34:34.741
A witness who once had a concussion.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.492
- While saving other people's lives.
- CHARLIE: Thank you.

34:36.576 --> 34:40.329
- That's not...
- Jim, while being courageous.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.374
And he was courageous again
stepping forward.

34:43.875 --> 34:47.503
Kids used to lie about their age
to get in the Army and fight in a war.

34:47.587 --> 34:48.921
That's what Sweeney did here.

34:49.005 --> 34:50.757
How much of what you're saying
do you believe right now?

34:50.923 --> 34:52.008
60%.

34:52.175 --> 34:54.093
I thought it was in the mid-80s.
You pulled it off.

34:54.177 --> 34:55.511
Experience.

34:55.970 --> 34:57.180
You need to talk to Deep Throat.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.056
I'm on the first shuttle to Washington.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.851
- Have you talked to him on the phone?
- We don't talk on phones.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.603
- How about your guy?
- We talk on phones.

35:03.686 --> 35:04.771
He's asking have you talked to your guy?

35:05.563 --> 35:07.482
- An hour ago.
- MACKENZIE: And?

35:07.565 --> 35:09.817
He says stand by the story.

35:15.865 --> 35:18.075
We go back over every inch
starting right now.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.745
By 8:00 tonight,
I want Will to be able to say we stand by it.

35:20.828 --> 35:23.331
And when he says it, we stand by it.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.500
Break 'em into teams.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.715
Had you realized yet
at the time of that meeting

35:32.840 --> 35:34.884
that Sweeney and Stomtonovich
weren't your only problem?

35:35.134 --> 35:36.677
Who says they weren't our only problem?

35:36.761 --> 35:39.680
Right.
That was an example of a leading question.

35:40.056 --> 35:43.392
A leading question suggests its own answer.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.436
When did you stop beating your wife, right?

35:45.561 --> 35:47.063
We never established I beat my wife.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.940
We never established you're married.

35:49.023 --> 35:50.107
- I'm not.
- Yeah.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.235
I'm not following you, Rebecca.

35:52.401 --> 35:55.321
MacKenzie had realized
at the time of the meeting

35:55.446 --> 35:56.906
- that Sweeney and Stomtonovich...
- There's no way.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.741
- There's no way.
- Jim, listen to me.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.828
- There's no way Mac's to blame for this.
- Valenzuela was your third witness.

36:01.911 --> 36:04.580
I have seen lawyers do some things in my life.
Jesus.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.374
Just listen.

36:06.541 --> 36:09.585
First red team, you have Sweeney,
you don't go to air.

36:09.752 --> 36:13.089
Red team two, you have Sweeney and
Stomtonovich, you don't go to air.

36:13.172 --> 36:18.010
Red team three, you have Valenzuela now
and Charlie green-lights it.

36:18.261 --> 36:22.098
Valenzuela was an important witness.

36:23.057 --> 36:24.267
Yeah.

36:25.393 --> 36:26.686
And?

36:28.479 --> 36:29.814
What if I led him?

36:29.897 --> 36:31.774
- WILL: Valenzuela?
- In his pre-interview.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.818
I've read the pre-interview transcript
100 times.

36:33.943 --> 36:36.279
I read it 1,000 times, but I've just read it again

36:36.404 --> 36:38.781
and I have to wonder
if I inadvertently led on that witness.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.825
- You didn't.
- I can make the case that I did.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.243
Look at what's good on the story.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.955
Stomtonovich, he didn't like the report.
Sorry, but we've got him on film.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.707
Sweeney, he wants to be heard

36:47.790 --> 36:50.293
and he thinks he'll be discounted
'cause of the TBI, so he lies.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.628
And by the way,
if I had a traumatic brain injury

36:52.795 --> 36:54.505
and knew that information
couldn't be discovered

36:54.589 --> 36:57.466
unless I volunteered it, I wouldn't volunteer it.

36:57.592 --> 37:00.928
I have a source. Is it POTUS? No. It's better.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.388
What would it take for you
to tell me the source?

37:02.471 --> 37:04.056
Someone would have to be torturing you.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.683
That's sweet, but...

37:05.766 --> 37:08.311
- Charlie has a source. You trust Charlie?
- Of course.

37:08.436 --> 37:09.896
And we have Valenzuela.

37:09.979 --> 37:11.731
There is much more about
this story that's good...

37:11.856 --> 37:13.190
And I'm saying what if I led Valenzuela?

37:13.274 --> 37:15.568
I objected to that in courtrooms for years.

37:15.651 --> 37:17.445
I know what a leading question sounds like.

37:17.528 --> 37:18.613
Then you know I asked them.

37:18.696 --> 37:20.072
You have to ask them in these situations.

37:20.197 --> 37:22.575
The guy... He was reluctant.
He didn't want to talk.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.036
Read the first line on page three.

37:27.079 --> 37:31.459
"McHale: We have a three-star general
who's an expert in chemical weapons."

37:31.542 --> 37:34.170
MACKENZIE: We have a three-star general
who's an expert in chemical weapons.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.588
Do you think he's lying?

37:45.014 --> 37:48.309
There was a video camera
on a tripod to record the pre...

37:50.019 --> 37:53.230
What if he thought the camera...
What if he thought the interview might get...

37:53.356 --> 37:56.150
You know, and he doesn't
want to call a general a liar?

37:56.233 --> 37:57.610
- That's nuts.
- It's not.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.571
He came to us.
He didn't want Sweeney to stand alone.

38:00.696 --> 38:03.658
And if Sweeney's wrong, then I gave
the wrong information to Valenzuela.

38:03.741 --> 38:07.620
Valenzuela's whole interview was goosed
by the information that came before it.

38:07.954 --> 38:10.164
Sweeney says everyone
was wearing MOPP suits.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.291
He told you that?

38:12.375 --> 38:15.378
What if Sweeney's got problems
and what if Valenzuela's his only friend?

38:15.503 --> 38:17.421
Look at line 303.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.592
I don't want Sweeney to stand alone.

38:21.676 --> 38:24.345
He doesn't raise
one original fact in this interview.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.638
Read it again.

38:25.721 --> 38:30.184
By the end, it's a recitation of everything
he's heard from Sweeney and from me.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.772
You need to sleep.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.821
(DOOR OPENS)

38:45.324 --> 38:46.367
A garage?

38:47.076 --> 38:49.412
- Seriously?
- SHEP: They still work.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.497
This place can't afford security monitors.

38:53.207 --> 38:54.709
What brings you to Washington, D.C.?

38:55.084 --> 38:57.586
- We're having trouble with the story.
- No shit.

38:57.670 --> 38:59.839
Tell me one more time we got it right.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.133
You want to see some pictures of David?

39:02.216 --> 39:04.510
- I'm sorry?
- Do you want to see some pictures of David?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.595
- Who's David?
- David's my son, Charlie.

39:06.971 --> 39:08.431
Is there a problem with the story?

39:08.514 --> 39:11.350
There he is.
We're moving him into his dorm at BU.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.311
And here he's home for Thanksgiving.

39:14.437 --> 39:17.189
- Shep.
- Hang on.

39:17.606 --> 39:20.568
That's on the Cape.
We rent a house in August.

39:20.901 --> 39:24.321
Here's a picture
he sent me his first day interning at ACN.

39:25.114 --> 39:29.285
And there he is, first day home
from rehab at Sierra Tucson.

39:29.368 --> 39:32.955
And this one's from his funeral last year.

39:36.876 --> 39:38.377
Jesus, Shep.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.379
I know, I took a picture at a funeral.

39:40.463 --> 39:41.964
That's crazy, but it's just for you.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.300
They call it heron now.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.635
Like the bird, just a little heron.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.137
I didn't have any idea.

39:48.220 --> 39:52.141
You hired him as a summer intern
on his 90th day.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.060
Three months is a landmark in that world.

39:54.143 --> 39:56.729
Three everything... Three days, three weeks,
three months, three years.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.314
Who the fuck knows why?

39:58.731 --> 40:01.817
- Are you sure you don't want to sit?
- We're in a garage!

40:02.818 --> 40:03.986
We can go somewhere.

40:04.070 --> 40:06.072
One of your people, Charlie,
one of your people...

40:06.155 --> 40:08.908
One of your people fired him
and you didn't stop it.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.619
I wish, man... I wish you'd talked.
There's an explanation.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.454
You didn't stop it.

40:13.537 --> 40:16.582
He was a good kid.
He was a smart kid and a worker.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.418
He was a 19-year-old junkie,
but he was clean 90 days.

40:19.502 --> 40:21.587
- Our social media guy runs the interns.
- Neal Sampat.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.339
- David...
- Whose name you didn't know.

40:23.464 --> 40:26.092
...was posting...
Is this something you really want to hear?

40:26.217 --> 40:28.594
Yes. From you, badly.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.722
- I never knew anything...
- He posted something on the Internet?

40:32.181 --> 40:33.808
- Look.
- Yeah?

40:33.891 --> 40:38.229
A couple of years ago,
<i>News Night</i> got a new EP and the show...

40:39.021 --> 40:40.856
Boy, is your wife...

40:40.940 --> 40:42.233
Linda is my ex-wife.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.860
The show took a turn and what?

40:46.862 --> 40:50.324
David posted things about it
on the Internet he didn't like.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.284
Things about...

40:52.368 --> 40:54.370
- He was politically engaged.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.788
- Neal...
- Neal Sampat.

40:55.871 --> 41:00.167
Neal warned him he can't do that
and he kept on doing it.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.461
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't step in.

41:03.212 --> 41:04.296
He deserved to be fired.

41:06.966 --> 41:09.218
How many stories have I given you?

41:10.719 --> 41:15.516
There was a moment a while back
I thought about having you killed.

41:16.058 --> 41:18.727
Then I thought, "What does Charlie Skinner
fear more than death?"

41:19.812 --> 41:22.523
"Sit back, wait for your moment."

41:23.732 --> 41:26.861
Then Jerry Dantana starts
calling MARSOCs about Genoa.

41:28.362 --> 41:30.072
The helo manifest you gave me.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.241
Hold it over light for 20 seconds.

41:36.954 --> 41:38.622
CHARLIE: So that happened.

41:39.957 --> 41:41.959
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.627
Are you kidding me with this story?

41:43.752 --> 41:44.962
No, this is all...

41:45.838 --> 41:48.257
All terribly true.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.801
- (COMPUTER BEEPING)
- There are protests erupting in Cairo.

41:51.594 --> 41:53.679
WILL: <i>March 2, 1955.</i>

41:54.221 --> 41:55.806
A young black woman is arrested

41:55.931 --> 41:59.268
for refusing to give up her seat
on a bus to a white man in Alabama.

41:59.894 --> 42:03.147
Civil rights leaders
and the ACLU rush to her side

42:03.230 --> 42:06.442
and she will be a symbol of the struggle
against segregation.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.321
Her name is Claudette Colvin
and she's 15 years old.

42:10.404 --> 42:11.947
She's also unmarried and pregnant.

42:12.448 --> 42:15.367
Civil rights leaders and the ACLU
decide that Colvin

42:15.451 --> 42:18.662
is not the best foot forward and stand down.

42:18.746 --> 42:20.956
Eight months later, Rosa Parks happens,

42:21.040 --> 42:24.460
but during that eight months,
a brilliant and charismatic young minister

42:24.793 --> 42:29.048
gets the attention of the community
and is chosen to lead the bus boycotts.

42:29.465 --> 42:31.508
If Claudette Colvin doesn't get pregnant,

42:31.592 --> 42:34.511
if they'd gone in the spring
instead of eight months later,

42:34.595 --> 42:38.390
Martin Luther King is a preacher
you've never heard of in Montgomery.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.559
I've got a few hundred people
outside the embassy

42:40.643 --> 42:42.770
- and so far it's peaceful.
- That's what I've got.

42:42.853 --> 42:44.313
- TAMARA: Which embassy?
- Ours.

42:44.396 --> 42:45.397
What are they protesting?

42:45.481 --> 42:46.440
TAMARA: Is anybody getting through
to Cairo?

42:46.523 --> 42:49.235
I've got the front desk at the Shepheard Hotel.
It's a couple blocks away.

42:49.318 --> 42:52.196
He's saying that people have been streaming
toward the embassy for about an hour.

42:52.279 --> 42:54.490
- Is he saying how many?
- He thinks a couple of thousand.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.742
- Thousand?
- A poli sci professor at AU in Cairo

42:56.825 --> 42:59.536
says that a Salafist leader
named Wesam Abdel-Wareth...

42:59.620 --> 43:02.915
He's like the Glenn Beck of Egypt
and he's the president of a television station.

43:03.082 --> 43:05.626
He put out a call to protest a movie
called <i>Muhammad's Tribe.</i>

43:05.709 --> 43:06.752
Why are they at the American embassy?

43:06.835 --> 43:08.796
Apparently it's an American movie,
but we can't find it.

43:09.088 --> 43:10.339
Wait a second.

43:10.464 --> 43:15.010
What's the name of the pastor
with the mustache who's crazy?

43:15.135 --> 43:16.303
- Terry Jones.
- Yes.

43:16.387 --> 43:18.681
He announced yesterday
that he was screening a movie.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.767
- I can't remember the name.
<i>- Innocence of Muslims.</i>

43:22.184 --> 43:23.811
Is it possible it's the same movie?

43:23.894 --> 43:25.437
WILL: Who is Giuseppe Zangara?

43:25.854 --> 43:31.443
I don't really know. He's a guy with a gun
who fired five shots in February 15, 1933,

43:31.527 --> 43:33.570
killing the Mayor of Chicago.

43:33.654 --> 43:36.156
Why? Because Zangara
was standing on a wobbly chair.

43:36.532 --> 43:38.200
And the Mayor of Chicago wasn't his target.

43:38.409 --> 43:39.868
It was the guy the mayor
was shaking hands with,

43:39.952 --> 43:42.788
the newly elected
President Franklin Roosevelt.

43:42.871 --> 43:47.293
If Zangara's chair isn't wobbly,
Roosevelt never takes office

43:47.376 --> 43:50.212
and we swear in his running mate,
John Nance Garner,

43:50.629 --> 43:55.843
a man whose political ideology was the basis
for his opposition to a package of legislation

43:56.135 --> 44:00.472
that would be called The New Deal
and we don't survive the Great Depression.

44:00.556 --> 44:02.182
It's the same movie. <i>Innocence of Muslims.</i>

44:02.266 --> 44:04.268
He changed the title
to get Muslims in to see it.

44:04.351 --> 44:05.644
There's a mash-up of it on YouTube.

44:05.728 --> 44:07.146
Does it seem offensive?

44:07.229 --> 44:08.480
To filmmakers at the very least.

44:08.564 --> 44:12.318
Okay, AP has just reported,
"Egyptian Islamist protestors angry over film

44:12.401 --> 44:14.611
"scale US Embassy wall
in Cairo and tear down flag."

44:14.737 --> 44:15.946
- The American flag.
- I understand that now.

44:16.030 --> 44:17.823
- Jim, this thing's starting to move.
- They breached the wall.

44:17.906 --> 44:18.949
DON: They've got a link to their website

44:19.033 --> 44:20.159
- with a message.
- I'm on their website.

44:20.242 --> 44:22.870
"The Embassy of the United States in Cairo
condemns the continuing efforts

44:22.953 --> 44:25.414
"by misguided individuals
to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims."

44:25.539 --> 44:26.790
They're apologizing for the movie?

44:26.874 --> 44:29.626
2,000 people just hopped the wall, man.
I'd apologize for whatever they want.

44:29.710 --> 44:31.420
- I wouldn't.
- Congratulations.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.591
We'll have video of the flag
in about five minutes.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.134
They took down our flag and replaced it

44:37.217 --> 44:38.927
with a black flag
and in Arabic writing it says...

44:39.053 --> 44:41.430
"There is no God but God
and Muhammad is the prophet of God."

44:41.597 --> 44:43.307
I hope our apology was sincere enough.

You want a job as the guy who answers
the front door of the embassy right now?

44:49.605 --> 44:51.523
London? When was the last time you slept?

44:51.607 --> 44:53.942
I've been busy standing by Genoa.
What about you?

44:54.151 --> 44:55.277
I have no problem standing by it.

44:55.652 --> 44:56.904
You were well trained.

44:56.987 --> 44:59.031
Guys, another demonstration's broken out.

44:59.114 --> 45:00.616
- JIM: In Cairo?
- In Libya.

Outside our consulate in Benghazi.

45:02.618 --> 45:04.203

45:04.286 --> 45:06.538
They keep water from leaking
through the joints in the fixtures.

45:06.622 --> 45:07.790
And that's what O-rings do.

45:07.915 --> 45:10.292
They're giant washers
that keep pressurized hydrogen

45:10.417 --> 45:12.961
from leaking out of the SRB,
the solid rocket booster,

45:13.045 --> 45:15.297
that shoots the space shuttle
out of the Earth's atmosphere.

45:16.048 --> 45:17.633
These O-rings have been tested and tested

45:17.716 --> 45:21.261
under every possible
circumstance but one, cold.

45:21.345 --> 45:23.931
They didn't test to see if the O-rings
worked when it was cold.

45:24.014 --> 45:25.391
Why would they even think to test for that?

45:25.474 --> 45:28.477
The thing's launching from south Florida.
When's it gonna be cold?

45:29.103 --> 45:31.146
On January 28, 1986,

45:31.647 --> 45:35.567
a cold snap dragged
the overnight temperature down to 18 degrees

45:35.651 --> 45:39.738
and it turns out the O-rings
stopped working below 40.

45:39.822 --> 45:43.242
So 73 seconds after the <i>Challenger</i> lifts off,

45:43.325 --> 45:46.995
it converts itself into a bomb and detonates.

All of it.

50:56.555 --> 50:58.849
WILL: <i>A half an hour later,</i>
<i>we retracted the story.</i>

51:00.475 --> 51:02.352
That was our top story, not Benghazi.

51:02.519 --> 51:05.063
On Benghazi we didn't trust
the source at State.

51:05.188 --> 51:06.898
We didn't trust anything anymore.

51:06.982 --> 51:09.276
We reported the same thing as everybody else

51:09.359 --> 51:11.486
even though we knew
we were probably wrong.

51:11.570 --> 51:15.407
<i>Protesters, angry over an amateur American</i>
<i>movie denouncing Islam,</i>

51:15.532 --> 51:18.827
<i>attacked the United States</i>
<i>consulate in Benghazi, Libya, today,</i>

51:18.952 --> 51:20.871
<i>killing a State Department officer.</i>

51:20.996 --> 51:24.541
<i>While in Cairo, demonstrators stormed</i>
<i>the walls of the United States Embassy.</i>

51:25.375 --> 51:27.252
<i>On the anniversary of 9/1 1...</i>

51:35.594 --> 51:37.888
We just stopped being good at...

51:43.518 --> 51:46.313
Genoa was a real mission. It was successful.

51:47.063 --> 51:49.608
Sweeney was right about the MOPP suits,

51:49.691 --> 51:52.194
just wrong about
the reason they were wearing them.

51:52.277 --> 51:55.197
It was in case
the militants had biological weapons.

51:55.322 --> 51:57.824
The white phosphorus
was only laid down to mark the target.

51:57.908 --> 51:59.785
Hamni8 didn't die in the raid.

51:59.868 --> 52:01.870
His prepaid cell plan ran out.

52:03.038 --> 52:05.040
It was an institutional failure.

52:05.290 --> 52:07.626
(SCOFFS) Bullshit.

52:09.503 --> 52:12.798
We'll call the election tomorrow
and then resign.

52:12.881 --> 52:15.050
She's on her way over.
We're meeting her upstairs.

52:16.218 --> 52:19.429
I'm sorry, Will. I really am.

52:19.554 --> 52:21.473
I wanted this to go another way.

52:24.059 --> 52:26.144
We both knew it wasn't gonna.

52:35.195 --> 52:36.404
WILL: <i>Did she seem mad?</i>

52:37.906 --> 52:38.907
CHARLIE: Hmm?

52:39.366 --> 52:41.201
When you talked to her on the phone.

52:41.284 --> 52:43.495
CHARLIE: It's after midnight.
You think we got her out of bed?

52:43.578 --> 52:46.748
You did not get me out of bed. Good night.

52:46.873 --> 52:49.000
I just paid $1,000 to see <i>Skyfall</i>

52:49.084 --> 52:51.503
and attend a party
at the Museum of Modern Art.

52:51.586 --> 52:54.172
The proceeds are going
to the Tribeca Film Festival.

52:54.256 --> 52:55.924
- You know why?
- To support the arts?

52:56.007 --> 52:58.635
- To meet Daniel Craig.
- Did you?

52:58.760 --> 53:00.595
Hurricane Sandy and the airports.

53:00.846 --> 53:03.849
- He wasn't there?
- He was not there.

53:03.932 --> 53:05.934
You look like Daniel Craig. Get up.

53:07.936 --> 53:11.356
Oh, you look less like him now.
Sit back down. And what about you?

53:12.274 --> 53:14.150
Why so glum, sugarplum?

53:14.234 --> 53:18.530
We're gonna resign, Leona.
It's what has to happen now.

53:18.613 --> 53:24.703
Elliot Hirsch, Sloan Sabbith,
Terry Smith, <i>Dayside ACN,</i> ACN.

53:24.786 --> 53:27.455
We understand the integrity of the news
is more important...

53:27.581 --> 53:30.208
Than one individual. That is beautiful.

53:31.209 --> 53:32.794
Not as beautiful as Daniel Craig.

53:32.878 --> 53:34.671
- Leona.
- I'd have sent my plane.

53:34.754 --> 53:37.090
- I'd have sent my plane.
- We're not fucking around.

53:37.173 --> 53:41.136
You will resign when I fire you
out of petty malice and not before.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.054
- Our trust numbers are...
- Yeah, they're bad.

53:43.138 --> 53:44.222
They're fatal.

53:44.306 --> 53:46.308
Firing Jerry was obviously
the right thing to do,

53:46.433 --> 53:49.019
but it wasn't enough
and we've known that for two months.

53:49.102 --> 53:51.104
Charlie and I have to go.

53:51.563 --> 53:53.857
- And Twiggy over here?
- It was my fault.

53:53.940 --> 53:58.069
McMac. Can I call you McMac?
Doesn't matter, I'm gonna anyway, McMac.

53:58.570 --> 54:01.156
- Your head's up your ass.
- Mrs. Lansing.

54:01.281 --> 54:03.783
Guy comes in here into my hizzy...

54:03.867 --> 54:05.994
Guy comes in here,
cooks an interview, no remorse.

54:06.745 --> 54:09.247
30 lawyers vet the story, it goes on air.

54:09.331 --> 54:12.667
You, I don't know what you'd do
to Sherlock Holmes this thing.

54:12.751 --> 54:15.712
I wouldn't be able to figure it out
and I'm the smartest person in the room.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.047
Well, I wouldn't go that...

54:17.130 --> 54:19.966
Oh, shut the fuck up,
you Daniel Craig wannabe.

54:20.050 --> 54:21.551
I don't want to be Daniel Craig.

54:21.676 --> 54:24.596
Well, you should want to be Daniel Craig.
Everybody should.

54:24.679 --> 54:26.806
Leona, are you stoned?

54:26.890 --> 54:29.017
You know, my makeup lasts a long time.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.311
- Oh, jeez.
- Mrs. Lansing.

54:31.394 --> 54:32.520
No, no, please, call me...

54:33.271 --> 54:35.148
Continue to call me Mrs. Lansing.

54:35.231 --> 54:38.526
- Leona...
- Guy comes into my house

54:38.610 --> 54:39.861
which I love.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.364
Which I bet you guys didn't know.

54:42.447 --> 54:45.867
But I love it. I love ACN.

54:47.077 --> 54:48.620
You don't make me a nickel

54:48.703 --> 54:50.789
and you cause headaches
for the divisions that do,

54:50.872 --> 54:52.332
but you make me...

54:54.167 --> 54:55.835
You make me so proud.

54:57.045 --> 54:58.088
(EXHALES)

54:58.171 --> 55:00.548
God, guy comes in here, cooks an interview,

55:00.674 --> 55:03.385
and this ends up with...
'Cause he's unemployable

55:03.468 --> 55:07.055
he gets a $5 million settlement
and the three of you leave?

55:07.138 --> 55:10.058
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I don't think so.

55:10.517 --> 55:11.977
And McMac.

55:12.310 --> 55:14.396
That's a name that's really
starting to grow on me.

55:14.646 --> 55:18.108
She doesn't have to go.
Nobody's ever heard of her.

55:18.191 --> 55:21.069
But she's gonna do the honorable thing.

55:21.152 --> 55:23.071
And what's expected of me, huh?

55:23.321 --> 55:27.450
Not to do the honorable thing?
What's expected of me?

55:28.159 --> 55:30.954
No, I do not accept your resignations.

55:31.246 --> 55:35.375
And Jerry Dantana's
not gonna get one fucking dollar.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.711
I got some kick-ass courtroom outfits.

55:37.794 --> 55:40.672
You have to accept our resignations
and you have to settle.

55:40.797 --> 55:42.340
He'll take it to trial and win.

55:42.424 --> 55:45.927
There was an institutional failure
and he was the only one fired.

55:46.052 --> 55:48.096
REBECCA: Then you'll need a good lawyer.

55:48.263 --> 55:51.307
Lee, don't accept their resignations.

55:51.474 --> 55:54.978
I already wasn't accepting
their resignations, Becca.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.689
Don't horn in on my honorable thing.

55:57.772 --> 56:00.191
God, I mean, can't a lady have...

56:00.316 --> 56:04.779
Leona, we don't have
the trust of the public anymore!

56:05.321 --> 56:06.781
Get it back!

56:12.829 --> 56:14.664
