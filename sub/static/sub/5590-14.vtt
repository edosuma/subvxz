I'm gonna have to drop you
from the label.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.939
Is this you
we're listening to?

00:06.941 --> 00:08.941
Did it all independently.
Really?

00:08.943 --> 00:10.809
Let's hear it
for the owner of the beverly,

Mr. Deacon claybourne!

00:13.948 --> 00:15.981
Juliette has to
prove herself.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.616
Okay. I agree
to supervised visits.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.784
Deacon:
We<i> are</i> trying to help her,

00:18.786 --> 00:20.719
So why on earth
would she steal from us?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.287
I needed the money.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.523
Man: She pays to park her car
in the lot.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.025
What happened?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.726
Reports of an altercation.
That's all I know.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.731
Juliette: Almost done.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.300
You're so good.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.503
There you go.
Mama got you all clean.

Aww. Sweet girl.

Good job.

Okay, well, that's all the time
we get today.

Ohh.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.852
Okay.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.654
Mama's got to say goodbye.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.923
But I'll see you soon.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.825
Thanks, em.
Of course.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.193
Appreciate it.

See you

01:02.897 --> 01:04.830
Okay.
Say, "bye, mama." bye.

Bye-bye!

01:06.400 --> 01:08.100
Mm.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.368
How do you feel?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.070
Sad to see her go.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.840
But other than that,
I feel really good.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.108
<i> Really</i> good.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.410
Different,
but in a good way.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.279
I'm glad to hear that.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.282
Because I think
you're ready to go home.

About vita's disappearance.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.225
[ inhales deeply ]

01:33.227 --> 01:35.127
It's, uh, unfortunate

01:35.129 --> 01:37.229
How everything played out
for her here,

01:37.231 --> 01:40.899
But the police are on it.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.702
Right now all we can do is just
hope and pray that she's okay.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.538
On a brighter note...

01:46.540 --> 01:48.607
As you have seen,

01:48.609 --> 01:52.544
That riff bell show
put this place on the map quick.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.413
Seems like everybody
wants to play here now,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.815
Which means this place
is gonna be packed again,

01:56.817 --> 01:57.816
[ door opens ]
so I want to make sure
everybody's --

Hey.
Hey.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.620
What are you doing here?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.122
I just came to grab
my dad's sport coat.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.156
I thought I saw it
in his office.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.557
Oh, all right.
Everything all right?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.293
'cause, uh, he didn't show
for the staff meeting.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.130
Oh. He said he was
taking the morning off.

02:11.132 --> 02:14.299
It's his 15-year anniversary
for being sober today.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.401
[ chuckles ]
that's a big milestone, yeah.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.937
You know, 15 years ago,
I got my dad back.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.006
Mm.
Well, I got to run.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.108
I'm going to be giving him
a cake at the west-end meeting.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.177
[ chuckles ]
that is very sweet.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.246
You know, I'm surprised
he didn't tell me about this.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.181
I'm sure
it just slipped his mind.

<i> Hey. It's vita.</i>
<i> You know what to do.</i>
[<i> beep</i> ]

Um...Please call me.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.160
Let me know you're okay.
Just reach out to me.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.528
All right. Bye.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.530
Ray, you have to stop.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.697
What happened
is not your fault.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.132
There was nothing
you could have done.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.601
I just -- I wish I could have
helped her somehow.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.470
And that detective does not
return my phone calls.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.839
Well, right now, we just need
to let them do their jobs.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.808
Are they doing their jobs?
I don't know, ray,
but we need to be doing<i> ours.</i>

02:56.810 --> 02:58.944
This is a big day. We got to
get our heads in the game.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.279
I'm in it.
I'm in it.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.314
Are we all set for
layla's showcase? Looks good.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.949
Every programmer
that we invited confirmed,

03:03.951 --> 03:05.384
So we're covered
for country radio.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.719
Great. Did we hear
from lady a?

03:07.721 --> 03:10.055
'cause it'd be so great to
tell these guys this afternoon

03:10.057 --> 03:11.690
That we've got layla booked
on a major tour.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.225
I spoke to their people
this morning.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.793
They want to go with someone
better known.

03:14.795 --> 03:15.661
Well...
Yeah.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.862
...It was worth a shot.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.864
And I talked to autumn chase,
and I said,

03:18.866 --> 03:21.200
"hey, come on by this afternoon
if you want to."

03:21.202 --> 03:22.301
Layla would be
a great fit for autumn.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.702
Wouldn't she, though?
Yeah.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.673
Look, I really believe if we can
get this album on the radio,

03:27.675 --> 03:30.475
We will change people's
perception of layla grant.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.978
[ sighs ]

03:32.980 --> 03:35.380
I swear I'm not usually
this much of a basket case.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.883
I just only have three songs
to impress these people.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.518
I just wanted to make sure
I got the right mix.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.320
You don't have to worry.
You're gonna blow them away.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.155

03:43.157 --> 03:45.557
Oh. Sorry. I didn't realize
anyone was back here.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.025
That's all right.
We're all done.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.161
Avery was just vetting my
set list for my showcase today.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.729
Oh, yeah,
I heard about that.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.331
Yeah. Knock 'em dead.
Thanks.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.566
Have they scheduled
the exes' showcase yet?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.668
No, we still got a bit of time
before the album launches,

03:56.670 --> 03:58.670
But, uh, bucky's got us playing
a few shows here and there

03:58.672 --> 04:00.372
To tighten things up.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.741
We're playing the bluebird
tonight, if you want to come.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.942
Will's gonna be there.
Really?

What about you?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.612
Yeah, me too.

Okay. Well, if everyone's going,

Awesome.
Cool.

I guess I'll see you
tonight, then.

It's been a while since I've
been the subject of applause.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.718
I've been feeling
a little overshadowed lately,

04:46.720 --> 04:48.987
And...This is nice.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.792
Anyway, I don't want
to go on about it.

how grateful I am to be here

Have a seat.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.757
Well, after taking
a little break from performing,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.926
I've decided to start
making music again.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.294
Glad to hear it.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.495
Yeah, I'm gonna
produce my own record

05:30.497 --> 05:32.531
As an independent artist.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.932
You know what --
that's as viable

05:33.934 --> 05:35.634
As any other platform
these days.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.035
It's come a long way

05:37.037 --> 05:38.804
From [chuckling] selling cds
from your trunk.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.939
Yeah, sure has.

to "shenandoah girl."

And I told you to tell everybody
that I wasn't working.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.122
And I did, but it's true
what they say --

The most powerful word
in the entertainment industry

Is "no."

with avery

About spending more time
with cadence,

18:09.222 --> 18:13.458

Completely shut me down.

and energy and...Effort

18:18.631 --> 18:21.065

18:21.067 --> 18:24.435

you're disappointed,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.438

Give him time. He'll see
the progress you've made.

What am I supposed to do
until then?

normally do?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.285
That's great.

that I'd have to spend

It's the only six hours
I have.

But a good buddy of mine
reminded me

38:05.751 --> 38:08.885
This is a daily battle.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.821
And thanks to him and...

38:11.823 --> 38:16.092
My daughter and my lord...

38:16.094 --> 38:18.094
Uh [sniffles]

38:18.096 --> 38:20.063
...I'm winning today.

38:29.808 --> 38:30.907
[ door opens ]

38:30.909 --> 38:32.575
We got to talk.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.010
I tried to stop him.
It's all right, christel.
I got it.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.113
Sorry. I-I should have
called you back.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.416
I had some important stuff
I had to tend to yesterday,

38:39.418 --> 38:40.450
And it slipped my mind.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.752
I get it.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.988
I'm not a priority --
to you or anyone else.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.424
Now, hold on a second.
You just asked me yesterday.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.826
Well, today I'm not asking,
I'm demanding.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.294
I want my songs back.

38:51.296 --> 38:52.629
I worked my ass off
on them,

38:52.631 --> 38:54.364
And just because you dropped me
from your label

38:54.366 --> 38:55.832
Doesn't mean
I don't get to record them.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.968
[ inhales deeply ]

38:58.970 --> 39:00.837
All right, will,
I'll, uh...

39:00.839 --> 39:03.039
I'll take the hold
off your songs.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.307
Seriously?

39:04.309 --> 39:05.809
Yeah, but before I do,

39:05.811 --> 39:08.378
There's something
I'd like you to consider.

39:08.380 --> 39:12.849
I dropped you when I did
'cause I was afraid.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.785
Afraid nashville wouldn't accept
a -- a gay country artist.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.722
Hell, I was afraid it might even
hurt my own career.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.323
But I've come to realize

39:20.325 --> 39:25.662
That just 'cause
something's hard or scary...

39:25.664 --> 39:27.964
Doesn't mean
you shouldn't do it --

39:27.966 --> 39:31.234
Especially if it's something
you believe in.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.936
And I believe in you.

39:34.339 --> 39:36.139
What exactly
are you saying?

39:36.141 --> 39:38.174
That I'm sorry.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.976
And that I'd like you
to come back

39:39.978 --> 39:41.177
To wheelin' dealin' records,

39:41.179 --> 39:42.645
Let<i> me</i>
put out your album,

39:42.647 --> 39:45.815
Like I should have done
the first time around.

39:45.817 --> 39:46.750
What do you say?

39:48.353 --> 39:50.086
You bet.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.062
Hey, there.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.897
Hey. How you doing?

40:00.899 --> 40:02.565
I'm a little beat.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.033
Yeah, I bet.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.535
Long night,
early morning.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.636
Aw.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.440
I missed you last night.
I miss you, too.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.509
How'd your meeting go
with frankie this morning?

40:12.511 --> 40:14.344
It was hard, you know?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.347
How was<i> your</i> meeting?

40:17.349 --> 40:18.081
It was good.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.349
I mean, you know,

40:19.351 --> 40:22.519
I've got country radio ready
to support layla grant.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.421
I got the exes on tour
with autumn chase.
[ chuckles ]

40:24.423 --> 40:27.123
It's been a great couple days
for highway 65.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.926
[ sighs ]

40:29.928 --> 40:31.694
My heart's
not really in it, though.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.363
You thinking about vita?

40:33.365 --> 40:35.732
Yeah.
Me too.

40:35.734 --> 40:39.569
And that visit I had
with the detective last night...

40:39.571 --> 40:41.037
[ sighs ]

40:41.039 --> 40:45.108
You know, he has
a stack of files --

40:45.110 --> 40:49.479
Girls just like vita
and our daughters...

40:49.481 --> 40:53.149
Who just disappeared.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.718
And he's so resigned about it,
you know?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.987
Like we're just
supposed to accept it.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.923
I<i> don't</i> accept that.

40:59.925 --> 41:02.258
So, what are you gonna do?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.460
I don't know.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.629
But I'm gonna do
<i> something.</i>

41:06.631 --> 41:08.631
[ ringing ]
[ sighs ]

41:08.633 --> 41:10.433
<i> You've reached avery.</i>
<i> Please leave a message.</i>

41:10.435 --> 41:12.068
[<i> beep</i> ]
[ voice breaking ]
hey, it's me.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.571
Um, I'm guessing
that you've heard

41:14.573 --> 41:17.140
That autumn went with the exes.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.776
Glenn says that I-I shouldn't
worry about it,

41:19.778 --> 41:21.377
That everything's
gonna be okay, but...

41:24.449 --> 41:27.750
Anyway, you said I could call,
so I'm calling.

41:27.752 --> 41:28.818
But you're not there.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.587
[ chuckles ]

41:30.589 --> 41:31.988
So...

41:33.658 --> 41:36.192
[ sobbing ]

41:37.429 --> 41:38.428
Hey.

41:38.430 --> 41:40.797
Hey.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.099
I, uh, heard on the news
you pulled out of the movie.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.301
I did.

41:45.303 --> 41:50.773
Well, since you're
gonna be around more...

41:50.775 --> 41:53.309
Maybe you should have more time
with cadence after all.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.178
[ exhales sharply ]

41:55.180 --> 41:57.180
Hi.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.182
Hi, baby.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.850
I'll come get her
in two hours?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.418
Okay.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.686
Okay.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.990
Hey, avery.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.859
I didn't drop out of the movie
so you'd change your mind.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.862
I didn't change my mind

42:12.864 --> 42:14.063
Because you dropped out
of the movie.
