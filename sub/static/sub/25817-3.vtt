00:10.969 --> 00:12.638
<i>I knew skinny was magic,</i>

00:13.597 --> 00:15.641
<i>but now, none of my bras fit.</i>

00:15.724 --> 00:17.518
<i>The new Patty was more powerful,</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:19.561
<i>but with much smaller boobs.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:22.898
Bob says nothing says confidence
like a good push-up bra.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.983
- What do you think about this one?
- Mmm.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.276
This one?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.695
I don't know.
I feel like I'd have to see it on.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.490
I just wanna look my best this weekend.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.618
I still don't understand
why Bob's taking you all the way

00:34.701 --> 00:37.120
to a pageant in Alabama
if you're not even competing.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.207
'Cause, he's gonna show me
how real pageant girls act.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.544
How they walk, how they talk,
how they smile.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.589
His coaching mentor is the director,
so she's giving us VIP access.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.342
Are you really into
all this beauty pageant stuff,

00:50.425 --> 00:51.593
or are you just into Bob?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.011
Both.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.973
And now that I'm getting him away
from his wife for the weekend,

00:56.515 --> 00:58.600
I'm gonna show him that
I am his soul mate too.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.102
We're perfect partners.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.770
We're gonna win Miss Magic Jesus,

01:01.853 --> 01:04.522
and Regionals, and Miss American Lady,
and then I'll be famous,

01:04.605 --> 01:06.817
and everyone else can S a big fat D.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.859
Oh, leopard!

01:08.360 --> 01:10.153
- Do you think he'll like this one?
- Hold up.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.531
What do you think is going to happen
on this trip?

01:12.948 --> 01:15.450
This weekend is going to be fun, fun, fun.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.998
This weekend is gonna be work, work, work.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.876
Why is seeing your pageant coaching mentor
suddenly such a goddamned emergency?

01:24.960 --> 01:28.005
Miss Magic Jesus is in
just a couple of weeks,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.381
and I need the extra help.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.549
Well, so do I!

01:31.049 --> 01:32.426
My dinner party is tonight,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.970
and all the Junior League ladies
are bringing their husbands,

01:35.053 --> 01:38.724
and you're leaving me alone
like some divorceé.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.434
I thought we were partners.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.019
We are.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.772
I cooked, I cleaned, I tszujed,
everything looks great!

01:46.273 --> 01:49.860
You know what doesn't look great?
You, taking a minor across state lines.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.528
That looks a lot like kidnapping.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.613
Don't be dramatic.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.698
Well, you're the one acting like
it's life or death.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.949
Because it is!

01:56.533 --> 01:58.660
- Why?
- Because Patty is out of control!

02:00.954 --> 02:01.830
What do you mean?

02:02.164 --> 02:04.249
<i>She nearly lit a man on fire.</i>

02:04.333 --> 02:05.167
She's just...

02:05.709 --> 02:07.586
a little willful, impulsive.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.755
Impetuous.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.882
Bob, she's a teenage girl,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.967
they're all insane and you know this.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.302
No, Patty is different!

02:16.928 --> 02:20.515
- How?
- Because she is my only coaching client.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.352
And you know that is
the most important thing in my life.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.895
- Mm-hmm.
- Other than you.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
Mm-hmm.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.316
Patty actually reminds me a lot of you
when I first met you.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.442
Bite your tongue.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.361
She has the same kind of fire.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.071
And if I could just harness it,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.115
I think she could take us both all the way
to Miss American Lady.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.618
I just have to get her under control.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.413
Stella Rose,
she taught me everything I know.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.165
She will know what to do.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.419
Would it really be so bad for you
to have to give up coaching?

02:49.503 --> 02:52.297
Oh, would it really be so bad
if you didn't get into the Junior League?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.137
Patty. What are you doing here?
I said I was gonna pick you up.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.640
Well, I was running early,
so I figured I'd save you the trip.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.935
- See what I mean? Willful.
- I can see the emergency.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.938
Meet me in the driveway,
I'll pull the car around.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.272
It's okay, I'll go in from the garage.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.108
- Patty, please.
- I'm sorry.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.197
<i>Coralee was wrong.
This was an emergency.</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:19.866
<i>If Stella Rose couldn't help me
control Patty's fire,</i>

03:19.950 --> 03:21.660
<i>she could burn us both to the ground.</i>

03:22.911 --> 03:23.745
Potato chip?

03:25.247 --> 03:27.874
No, thanks.
Once I start on those, I can't stop.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.962
What the hell is all this crap?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.548
Snacks. Road trip calories don't count.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.550
What? Of course they do!

03:36.633 --> 03:37.801
Will you put that away?

03:39.136 --> 03:40.011
You're in a mood.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.555
Is it Coralee?

03:44.433 --> 03:46.435
Every time I come around, she gets tense.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.645
I wouldn't take it personally. I think...

03:49.187 --> 03:52.315
you just remind her a lot of herself
when she was that age.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.569
But why are you trying to change me?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.320
Don't you like me the way I am?

03:57.738 --> 03:58.989
I love you.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.576
You are beautiful, and fierce,
sophisticated.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.704
I just want you to wear all that
on the outside too.

04:06.830 --> 04:07.998
- Mm-mm.
- Mmm.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.207
- Mm-mm.
- Mmm.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.542
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.211
<i>Do I remind you of your wife?</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:20.260
Actually, you remind me more of myself.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.013
<i>See? Soul mates.</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:27.267
I um...
I made us a playlist for the road.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074

04:53.001 --> 04:56.087
You know,
usually I'm partial to the classics.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.007
Britney. Christina. But I do like this.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.235
<i>I was finally at a real pageant.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:20.237
<i>And with no one else around,</i>

05:20.529 --> 05:22.697
<i>I would have Bob's full attention.</i>

05:23.198 --> 05:24.658
How do I look? How's my hair?

05:25.659 --> 05:26.535
You look great.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.578
Are you okay? You seem nervous.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.121
Nervous? No. I, uh...

05:30.372 --> 05:33.375
I just haven't seen Stella Rose
in almost 20 years

05:33.458 --> 05:35.752
and she is a bit of a harsh critic.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.420
She's even more direct than I am.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.297
I didn't think that was possible.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.675
Oh, trust me, she's a legend.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.679
Before she started directing,
she coached three Miss USAs,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.974
one Miss American Lady...
Oh, my God, she's here.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.309
Well!

05:51.601 --> 05:54.062
Look what the horse drug in.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.277
You look like
something the cat dragged in.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.903
I'm sorry.
My stylist used too much product.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.782
- Nobody cares about your sob story.
- Hey, hey.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.869
Oh, it's not that bad.

06:08.952 --> 06:12.414
Look, no. You just need a little...

06:21.965 --> 06:23.008
And...

06:24.301 --> 06:25.176
there.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.636
No more tears.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.643
Impressive.
You got a daughter in the pageant?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.354
Oh, no, I'm here for a conference.
I'm a lawyer.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.149
What's a lawyer know about fixing hair?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.444
A trial is the biggest pageant there is.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.280
I gotta make sure my clients pass muster
before a jury.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.365
You've got a gift for style.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.118
Ever thought about making money at it?

06:50.952 --> 06:53.872
I did, but my wife put the kibosh on it.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.541
The night before I was scheduled
to take the bar,

06:56.833 --> 07:00.921
I got offered a sales management position
at Bergdorf Goodman.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.964
But she wouldn't let me take it.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.635
Said it wouldn't give us the lifestyle
that she wanted.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.303
That's tragic.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.850
You are literally the only person
that thinks that, besides me.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.478
Well, you clearly have a calling.

07:17.354 --> 07:21.149
I don't know if you're a good lawyer,
but you'd make a hell of a pageant coach.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.944
Pageant coaching? That's a thing?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.696
It sure is.
And you can make a pretty penny at it too.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.491
I mean, if you need that as a way
to sell the idea to your wife.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.910
Oh, I wouldn't know where to start.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.703
Well, honey, that's where I come in.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.581
I've got more clients than I can handle.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.292
And I'm looking for a partner.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.803
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
my first protégé, Bob Armstrong.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.515
Bob, I'd like you to meet
my Bareback Buckaroos.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.308
You are looking well.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.894
And I see you're still wearing that rug
on your head.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.187
- What rug?
- Patty,

07:59.688 --> 08:02.857
I would like you to meet
Miss Stella Rose Buckley,

08:02.941 --> 08:04.317
my pageant mentor,

08:04.401 --> 08:06.820
and the director of
Miss Bareback Buckaroo.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.658
Stella Rose, meet my star client,
Patricia Bladell.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.326
Hmm.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.332
Well, I never would've known
she was a heifer,

08:19.416 --> 08:20.750
except for these.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.837
I'm guessing you're what?
Like a Double D?

08:24.212 --> 08:28.216
Oh, uh, hey, sorry.
She has aggression problems.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.469
- That's kind of how we met.
- It's okay. I like 'em feisty.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.806
- Plus, she's a stunner.
- Wait, you approve?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.017
You're lucky I quit coaching, Bob.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.352
Otherwise, I might try to take her
for myself.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.858
Patty, I want you to meet Roxy.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.610
She's gonna be your tour guide
through Miss Bareback Buckaroo.

08:48.153 --> 08:52.532
Oh, my God! This is gonna be so much fun.
You're a pageant virgin?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.034
- Yeah.
- Roxy.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.163
Why don't you take Patty back to the hotel
and get her all settled.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.706
The grown-ups need to have a chat.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.500
Oh. Uh...

09:02.751 --> 09:04.586
Go on. We'll catch up later.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.981
Choi, I need to borrow your car.
It's an emergency.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.316
Uh-huh, totally.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.610
Are you even listening to me?

09:29.319 --> 09:30.904
Eww. You're sexting?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.405
No! It's Teen Roulette.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.409
It's an app for meeting people,
from the waist down.

09:36.493 --> 09:41.122
So you don't get hung up
on superficial things like... faces.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.042
I found a girl within a one mile radius

09:44.125 --> 09:45.752
- who wants to hook up...
- Please stop talking.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.922
Did you say something about
borrowing my car?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.382
Yeah, I need to go Alabama to save Patty.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.593
I tried calling her mom,
but she's in rehab, so...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.969
What's wrong with Patty?

09:55.345 --> 09:58.598
Her alleged child molester, lawyer, slash,
beauty pageant coach

09:58.681 --> 10:00.183
is taking her across state lines.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.685
I'm scared something bad's gonna happen.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.772
- Long story.
- You can tell me on the way.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.817
To Alabama? Why would you come?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.277
'Cause I've never been to Alabama.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.738
Or anywhere outside of Georgia.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.450
Plus, maybe if I come to Patty's rescue,
she'll actually let me feel her boobs.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.077
Let's get one thing straight.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.579
If anyone's rescuing Patty, it's me.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.040
- I'm the one who's gonna...
- Feel her boobs?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.711
I was gonna say...
be her knight in shining armor.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.134
I get off in half an hour.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.844
- I'll meet you outside.
- Okay.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.979
Okay. So the headlines are,

10:46.062 --> 10:48.106
you used to be fat
and your coach is a diddler?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.650
- Alleged diddler.
- That's so badass.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.652
Compared to yours, my story sucks.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.781
I got bullied, my mom wanted me to have
more self-confidence,

10:56.865 --> 10:59.492
so I tried modeling,
but the girls were dumb,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.870
so I got into pageanting.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.455
Wait. You were bullied too?

11:04.747 --> 11:07.417
Well, not anymore.
Stella Rose is all about sisterhood.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.334
Oh.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.713
- What? You don't like Stella Rose?
- No, I don't know anything about her.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.216
Just that my coach is obsessed with her
and he should be paying attention to me.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.887
Oh, you have a crush on him.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.763
What? No, no, I don't.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.308
You know, I have some butt-tape
in my purse.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.643
When we get up to the room,
we'll tape your boobs together,

11:25.727 --> 11:26.936
make 'em look extra perky.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.855
That'll get his attention for sure.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
- Ladies.
- Thank you.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.524
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.193
Sorry, you said butt-tape?

11:36.613 --> 11:38.031
Wait up, losers.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.742
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.910
I am too.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.412
I'm gonna get photos of that
child molester in action.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.414
You're not the only one
who wants to take him down.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.209
Dixie, please. You know
you made that whole molestation thing up.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.169
I did not. My mom did!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.214
I mean, my mom...

11:54.756 --> 11:57.717
She knows that... it really happened.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.887
And even if it didn't,
he still might do something else.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.057
Wait, if Bob's innocent,
why are we going to Alabama?

12:04.140 --> 12:06.059
'Cause I'm not worried about
what Bob's going to do,

12:06.142 --> 12:07.268
I'm worried about Patty.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.103
She has a crush on him.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.356
And when she has a crush,
she can get kind of crazy.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.192
If he gets to feel her boobs,
I'm gonna be so pissed.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.277
We're taking my car.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.156
Come on, bitches!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.619
She's referring to you when she says
"bitches," by the way.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.600
Hey, thanks for seeing me.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.478
I wasn't sure you would
after how things went down.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.146
Oh, it's ancient history.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.900
Besides, I figured you were desperate
or else you wouldn't have called me.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.610
I'm not, I'm not desperate.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.822
- Like hell you're not.
- Okay, I am desperate.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.992
For redemption,
and Patty is my last chance.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.577
But she's also the best chance
I've ever had.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.663
- Still the drama queen.
- Oh, come on.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.956
Stella Rose.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.002
She just won't listen.
And I'm afraid if I can't control her,

13:14.085 --> 13:17.630
she's just gonna go off the rails in a way
that I'll never get her back. Can you...

13:18.923 --> 13:20.591
just tell me what I'm doing wrong?

13:21.050 --> 13:21.884
Please?

13:23.594 --> 13:26.764
Well, I'll need to watch you coach her.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.107
- Hey, Nonnie.
- Hey!

13:36.441 --> 13:37.442
How's it going over there?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.736
Dicey. Bob's totally blowing me off.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.156
- That sucks.
<i>- But Roxy gave me butt-tape for my boobs,</i>

13:43.239 --> 13:44.407
and I'm...

13:44.490 --> 13:47.410
<i>- Wait, who's Roxy, and what's butt-tape?</i>
- Oh, crap.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.579
I gotta go. Uh, I'll talk to you later.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.958
Do you know what butt-tape is?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.586
Yeah. You use it to tape your clothes
to your butt.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.962
Obviously.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.923
Why on earth would anybody wanna
tape their clothes to their butt?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.259
So your shorts don't ride up. Duh!

14:04.385 --> 14:05.470
It's a pageant thing.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.681
Looks like Patty made a new friend,

14:08.765 --> 14:11.184
who understands pageant stuff.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.935
That's good. Right?

14:15.605 --> 14:16.647
Drive faster!

14:20.068 --> 14:23.529
<i>Bob's arrangement was impeccable
but it wasn't enough.</i>

14:24.072 --> 14:27.992
<i>For the Junior League ladies to accept me,
everything had to be perfect.</i>

14:29.035 --> 14:32.955
<i>Without Bob, I was missing
my most important accessory.</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:38.044
<i>Unless he came back.</i>

14:40.129 --> 14:40.963
Surprise!

14:41.506 --> 14:42.965
Brandi Lynne.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.760
- Give your sister some sugar!
- Oh, God.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.346
- Okay. Yeah.
- I figured we were due for a visit.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.640
I haven't seen you since Cousin Delilah

14:50.723 --> 14:52.725
decided to get re-virginized,
which was what,

14:52.809 --> 14:55.353
- three years ago?
- Well, you should have called first,

14:55.436 --> 14:58.564
because I have a dozen people coming
over here for dinner, no kids allowed.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.067
And no embarrassing family members.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.820
- Well, I mean...
- Let's go, kids.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.281
Your fancy pants auntie's
being a first class bitch.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.291
Drive safe now, and enjoy that open road.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.421
Lord...

15:22.463 --> 15:25.007
This has been happening a lot lately.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.426
It just won't start.

15:26.801 --> 15:30.179
No, no, no. But if you stay,
then I'll have to cancel my dinner.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.722
Hunker down, kids.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.308
- Looks like we're staying for a spell.
- No, no, no.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.438
<i>I needed to stay focused.</i>

15:39.689 --> 15:42.150
<i>I was about to coach
before the coach of coaches.</i>

15:42.567 --> 15:44.902
<i>It wasn't just about
what Stella Rose thought of Patty,</i>

15:44.986 --> 15:46.612
<i>it was about what she thought of me.</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:48.197
Where's your client?

15:48.865 --> 15:51.868
Well, she's late.
I told you she doesn't follow directions.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.037
You better hope
she's not looking for a new coach.

15:55.121 --> 15:58.124
What... What?
Why would you even say that?

15:58.207 --> 16:01.878
Because if I were her, I'd want someone
who didn't need any extra help.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.213
It makes you look like
you're in over your head.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.966
Hello, I am! That is why I'm here.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.218
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, my God.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.053
What happened to you?

16:11.137 --> 16:13.514
Roxy taped me up.
She said it would maximize my assets.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.976
Oh, they are most definitely maximized.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.521
I said skinny is magic,
not skanky is magic.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.190
You don't need to shame her, Bob.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.277
C'mon, honey, let's work on that walk.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.862
Oh, she is not ready for the walk.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.280
Stella Rose thinks I am.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.241
Stella Rose is not your coach. I am.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.535
- But you said she was a legend.
- Look.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.829
I thought maybe you'd just watch, yeah?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.164
Let me do the coaching.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.043
- I need to see what she can do, right?
- Fine.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.086
You think you can do the walk, do it.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.135
This is not gonna be pretty.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.273
Okay, stop stop!

17:06.108 --> 17:09.403
You look like a yeti trying to
escape a Nat Geo photographer.

17:10.570 --> 17:11.571
I think it's better

17:12.114 --> 17:13.406
if I show you myself.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.498
Sorry. I've just never seen
heels that big.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.667
Not to brag, but I am a ladies size 14.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.801
Okay now, watch and learn.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.355
No, no!

17:44.438 --> 17:48.651
You're still forgetting to
squeeze the cheeks and thrust...

17:48.734 --> 17:49.694
Hey! Boundaries.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.654
- I'm helping you, Bob.
- You are groping me.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.364
Anyone's gonna get groped,
it's gonna be me.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.285
I thought I was the one being coached,
not you.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.328
This is a waste of time.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.207
- Can I talk to you outside, Bob?
- Yup.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.752
I can see your problem.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.754
Patty doesn't respect you.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.798
Well, if that is true,
you are not helping.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.633
She knows you're vulnerable, Bob.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.135
She can smell your desperation

18:14.218 --> 18:15.845
like that cheap cologne you were wearing
when I met you.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.056
That was Paco Rabanne Invictus.
That's $40 for the travel size.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.268
- I'm right and you know it.
- Well, what do you suggest I do about it?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.439
She's a wild Mustang. Break her.

18:27.398 --> 18:30.693
You've gotta jump on her
and wrap your fist in her mane

18:30.776 --> 18:34.071
and ride her like the devil
and put her up foamy

18:34.155 --> 18:35.740
- and wet...
- Okay, yep. I get it.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.908
And I'll dangle the carrot.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.288
- Show her it's all worth it.
- You mean like good cop, bad cop?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.375
Mama always did know best.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.670
You need to move all these
make-up caboodles to the dressing area.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
Two at a time, one in each hand.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.798
I thought we were gonna watch rehearsal.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.217
No, you need to learn
to follow directions first.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.428
Why? I'm great at following directions.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.387
Patty!

18:58.846 --> 19:02.141
In the week since I've been your coach,
you have almost lit a man on fire,

19:02.224 --> 19:05.603
got alcohol poisoning,
and stolen evidence from a police locker.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.938
That might be indicative
of a behavior problem.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.357
Anybody could have an off week.

19:09.774 --> 19:13.069
Do as I say,
or we're gonna have a problem.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.738
All right, find me when you're done.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.370
Hey. Why aren't you at rehearsal?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.789
Mmm. I got stuck on the phone with my BF,

19:24.914 --> 19:28.334
but it's cool, so Rose and I are tight,
she'll give me a pass.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.169
What are you doing?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.963
Oh, Bob said I have to move these.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.465
Well, here, let me help ya.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.135
And then, you can watch rehearsal.
That's why you came, right?

19:39.470 --> 19:40.721
Why are you being so nice to me?

19:40.805 --> 19:42.348
This is what we do.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.934
A queen always helps another queen
fix her crown.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.268
C'mon.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.485
Just show me the last three beats.
Come on, this is the big time. Sparkle!

19:59.281 --> 20:01.742
- All done.
- Already? How?

20:01.826 --> 20:02.827
I had a little help.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.662
That's what pageants are about, right?
Sisterhood?

20:04.745 --> 20:08.165
That is not how I told you to do it.
Go back and do it the right way.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.794
Oh, come on Bob. Don't be such a hard ass,
this is supposed to be fun.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.298
Good cop!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.009
<i>Being bad cop was one thing,</i>

20:19.093 --> 20:22.596
<i>but Stella Rose making me look incompetent
was another thing altogether.</i>

20:22.680 --> 20:25.057
Fine. You came here for a pageant,

20:27.518 --> 20:28.811
let's get you on stage.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.148
Hold it still.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.775
They've gotta light the horse
for the opening ceremonies.

20:34.859 --> 20:38.154
- I'm going to fall off. There's no saddle!
- That's why it's called Bareback Buckaroo.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.280
No, it's not.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.659
He can sense your fear, darling. Relax.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.662
Squeeze your thighs together
and thrust your hips forward.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.792
Oh, God. Oh, God!

20:56.338 --> 20:57.798
Oh, shit.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.387
- Can we leave?
- No.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.859
Seriously? You're gonna make her clean it?
That's disgusting!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.111
Go on. It's not gonna wipe itself.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.738
What does poop have to do with pageants?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.072
- Yeah.
- Mind your own business.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.909
You follow directions. Do as I say.

21:29.747 --> 21:33.375
Not like that.
A lady never gets down on her knees.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.377
Don't!

21:40.883 --> 21:42.885
I do this on my kitchen floors,

21:42.968 --> 21:46.347
and I defy you to look at them
without sunglasses.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.891
- Who's pooping in your kitchen?
- Hey.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.602
I'll be back in a little while.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.395
Stella, keep an eye on her.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.527
<i>Something didn't smell right,
and it wasn't the horse shit.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:02.363
<i>I had to know.
If Stella Rose wasn't helping,</i>

22:02.696 --> 22:04.073
<i>what was she up to?</i>

22:07.368 --> 22:08.744
Oh, holy God.

22:09.286 --> 22:13.249
I'm in the shower for 15 minutes, and
you turn my front lawn into a water park?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.917
Come on, Coralee.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.753
You keep clenching that tight,
you're gonna pull something.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.963
Okay, I called the mechanic

22:19.046 --> 22:21.340
and it's triple time
to do house calls on the weekend,

22:21.423 --> 22:24.510
- so we have to wait till Monday.
- Great! We can spend more time together.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.179
Doing what? Baby pool mud wrestling?

22:27.263 --> 22:29.390
Let's go. Last time I promised you
double or nothing.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.685
No! There is a reason
I left that trailer park.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.271
Because you think you're better than us,
you always have.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.148
Everybody else might believe
that swanky MILF act, but not me.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.359
- Alright. Are you done?
- Hey, Coralee!

22:40.442 --> 22:41.277
Oh, shit.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.697
Well, well, well.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.907
- What have we here?
- Shut your pie hole, Brandi Lynne.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.784
Bob, hi!

22:49.118 --> 22:50.369
What are you doing here?

22:50.452 --> 22:53.747
Well, Etta Mae felt awful about
you coming down with a cold

22:53.831 --> 22:55.082
and having to cancel your dinner.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.419
So she asked me to drop off
some of her world-famous shepherd's pie.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.797
That is just so thoughtful of both y'all.

23:02.548 --> 23:06.385
- And, uh, who might this be?
- Uh... a charity case.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.221
We adopted a family from the trailer park,

23:09.305 --> 23:10.973
and they were supposed to come
next weekend.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.767
But her brain is so fried
from all the meth

23:13.893 --> 23:15.269
that she got the dates wrong.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.022
- She's lying. I'm her...
- She also had a stroke,

23:18.105 --> 23:20.816
so most of what she says
doesn't make any sense at all.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.444
And now her trailer is on the fritz.

23:23.527 --> 23:28.490
So it looks like she and her crack babies
are gonna be with us for a while.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.243
- Well, Bob can't fix it?
- He's outta town.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.456
The only time Bob's been under a car
is when he was hiding from a grizzly.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.582
You want a beer?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.542
- Oh, bless her heart.
- Well, listen...

23:38.876 --> 23:39.710
She's crazy.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.338
I know a little about engines,
and I do owe you a favor.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.756
I'm happy to take a look.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.258
That is if you don't mind me
peeking under your hood?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.010
Peek away.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.262
You know, she doesn't have a hood.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.389
- That's alright, I'm happy to.
- It's okay, you know...

23:52.806 --> 23:53.724
Oh, all right.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.230
Hey, Stella Rose,
we're about to head to the spa, so...

24:00.689 --> 24:02.066
Is it that time already?

24:03.651 --> 24:07.071
My goodness, you've been at that
a long time. Why don't you take a break?

24:07.404 --> 24:10.616
Come with us. The pageant's paying
for all the girls to get treatments.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.868
Yeah, c'mon, it'll be fun!

24:13.327 --> 24:16.497
I need to finish. Bob says I need to learn
to follow directions.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.457
Bob needs to learn to back off.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.502
If he's not careful, he's gonna
ruin this for you before it even starts.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.130
- He's just looking out for me.
- Bob only looks out for himself.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.633
He's a complete and total narcissist.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.094
- Trust me. I know.
- Bob's a legend around here,

24:30.177 --> 24:31.261
and not in a good way.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.807
- Stella Rose told us the whole story.
- Oh, yeah.

24:34.890 --> 24:38.727
I took him under my wing,
taught him everything he knows. And then,

24:39.186 --> 24:41.230
when he thought he had a better deal,

24:42.523 --> 24:45.359
he dropped me
like a corn dog without a stick.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.822
Mark my words, he will do the same to you.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.742
- He says he believes in me.
- Oh, sure he does!

24:53.867 --> 24:57.413
Do you think he'd be this invested in you
if he'd met you when you were fat?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.373
He's an opportunist.

24:59.957 --> 25:03.502
He found someone vulnerable
and took advantage. Trust me.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.879
He doesn't care about you,

25:06.505 --> 25:07.381
but I do.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.220
Us girls gotta look out for each other,
right?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.724
Dry your tears and you come on to the spa.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.227
<i>And snap went the trap.</i>

25:20.436 --> 25:21.812
<i>Stella Rose wasn't a good cop.</i>

25:21.895 --> 25:24.565
<i>She was a thief trying to steal my client.</i>

25:24.982 --> 25:27.026
<i>I had to do damage control.</i>

25:29.028 --> 25:30.988
Hey ladies! How's it going?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.073
Uh, we're going to the spa,
just the girls.

25:33.490 --> 25:37.161
Oh, Patty can't make it.
I made lunch reservations for two.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.370
Um...

25:38.579 --> 25:40.581
I think I'd like to hang out
with the girls tonight.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.459
Oh, you will, tomorrow.
Come on, we don't wanna be late.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.674
<i>I finally had Bob alone,</i>

25:51.550 --> 25:54.011
<i>and now, I wasn't sure that I wanted him.</i>

25:55.179 --> 25:56.305
You okay?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.687
What would have happened
if you met me while I was fat?

26:08.025 --> 26:12.071
I'm gonna tell you the truth,
because I want you to trust me.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.948
I would've done my best
to get you out of jail,

26:15.032 --> 26:16.867
and I would have moved on with my life.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.830
So you are an opportunist.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.624
And you're not?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.835
Did you have any interest
in beauty pageants before you met me?

26:26.919 --> 26:28.712
We're the same, Patty.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.881
Perfect mirrors. Perfect partners.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.008
You don't act like we're partners.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.885
You've been dismissing me
since we got here.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.221
- Haven't learned a thing about pageants...
- Dut-dut-dut-dut!

26:38.097 --> 26:40.682
- Yes, you have.
- Name one.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.144
Actions speak louder than words.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.604
Get up and do the walk.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.398
Here?

26:48.816 --> 26:50.859
- I can't do... I can't even...
- Yes.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.986
Yes, you can. Trust me.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.256
- I told you I can't.
- Try again.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.176
Now,

27:17.261 --> 27:19.471
carry the caboodles like I showed you.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.932
Shoulders back, headlights up.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.851
Show me you can follow direction.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.107
Keep walking.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.317
Now, sit on the horse.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.444
Squeeze those thighs,

27:34.528 --> 27:36.113
push those hips forward.

27:42.911 --> 27:43.871
Good.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.623
Okay, now, wipe the floor.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.712
Slide and glide.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.714
Mm-hmm.

27:58.177 --> 28:02.764
And turn. Carry the caboodles,
sit on the horse, wipe the floor.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.815
Oh, my God!

28:12.608 --> 28:15.319
- You're a genius!
- Not really. I just Miyagi-ed you.

28:16.778 --> 28:17.654
What's a Miyagi?

28:19.323 --> 28:23.827
It's when you care enough about someone
to help them get out of their own way.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.294
- Younger sister.
- Hmm?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.004
- Hmm? What?
- Hmm?

28:34.087 --> 28:34.922
Hmm.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.759
<i>This weekend was better
than I had ever imagined.</i>

28:38.926 --> 28:40.052
<i>I had a new friend,</i>

28:40.135 --> 28:42.804
<i>and after our lunch,
I felt closer to Bob than ever.</i>

28:43.764 --> 28:46.391
<i>I wasn't... Hang on.</i>

28:49.102 --> 28:51.104
<i>I wasn't a pageant virgin anymore.</i>

28:51.521 --> 28:53.774
<i>It was time to swipe the other v-card.</i>

28:54.775 --> 28:56.902
<i>I was just grateful I'd come prepared.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:06.703
Floor it.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.624
Why are you stopping?

29:10.707 --> 29:12.125
Urgent business.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.713
Oh, my God!
Are you taking a picture of your hoo-ha?

29:16.797 --> 29:20.008
Gross! Why would anybody wanna see
a pic of your shenanigans?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.680
You're Napoleon Bone Your Parts?

29:24.763 --> 29:25.973
You're Pacific Rim Job?

29:26.056 --> 29:28.642
- I'm gonna puke like four times.
- I'm shocked.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.310
You're too hot to be on Teen Roulette.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.228
Really?

29:32.312 --> 29:34.940
None of the guys at school will date me.
They think I'm stuck up.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.775
No, they think you're mean.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.153
I, on the other hand, do better
when no one sees my face.

29:40.696 --> 29:41.697
I like your face.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.991
Well, I like your dong.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.493
- That wasn't my dong.
- Why would you use a bogus dong?

29:46.576 --> 29:48.495
'Cause the Internet is forever.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.416
- It is?
- Get in the back, I'm driving.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.251
Chinese fire drill.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.253
I don't think you're supposed to say that.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.838
Sorry, Donald Choi!

30:05.304 --> 30:06.263
Knock-knock.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.228
Bob.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.772
What a surprise.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.442
How long were you planning
on stealing Patty?

30:18.942 --> 30:22.321
- Well, how long did you think?
- Is that what this is about? Revenge?

30:23.030 --> 30:25.866
Do you have any idea
how much it hurt when you left?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.367
C'mon, Stella Rose.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.244
I gave up on men completely.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.038
I even tried women.

30:32.122 --> 30:35.250
But not even a 30-year-old with PMS
and bipolar disorder

30:35.334 --> 30:37.711
could replace the drama you stole from me!

30:37.794 --> 30:40.839
- You said it was ancient history!
- For you!

30:41.548 --> 30:42.549
You moved on.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.843
From me!

30:45.344 --> 30:47.346
From the best sex you ever had.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.766
- And for what?
- For Coralee.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.977
- For my wife.
- She doesn't appreciate you.

30:54.061 --> 30:57.773
I'm the only one who ever encouraged you
to embrace your true gifts.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.691
I'll never understand what you see in her.

30:59.775 --> 31:00.942
She is my soul mate.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.903
She's trash.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.115
Is that all you got?

31:15.791 --> 31:17.250
Oh, God, I missed us.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.003
Oh, Bob, we're still great together.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.923
Good cop, bad cop.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.549
Mama knows best.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.721
Stella Rose, stop!

31:30.680 --> 31:31.515
Stop.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.786
<i>And I thought Patty was crazy.</i>

31:55.664 --> 31:57.666
- Hey, partner.
- Argh! Oh, Patty.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.878
- What in the hell?
- Don't you wanna see my Miyagi?

32:01.962 --> 32:04.047
Absolutely not!

32:04.214 --> 32:07.634
- Wait, but... Wait, Bob...
- Get out!

32:09.344 --> 32:11.138
Wait, wait...

32:17.561 --> 32:19.062
<i>I was such an idiot.</i>

32:19.563 --> 32:23.150
<i>Thinking that Bob was starting to see me
as his perfect partner.</i>

32:24.568 --> 32:26.069
<i>He was right about one thing.</i>

32:26.278 --> 32:27.529
<i>I had to get out.</i>

32:45.630 --> 32:47.632
This is better than pay-per-view porn.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.177
Keep it in your head, stroke-y.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.470
All I'm saying is,

32:51.553 --> 32:53.680
he'd look a hell of a lot better
on your arm

32:53.763 --> 32:55.682
than that sissy nuts husband of yours.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.477
And I know how much you care
about appearances.

32:59.019 --> 33:02.063
Ladies, I think I figured it out.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.067
Broken radiator hose. Upper and lower.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.320
It's expensive right?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.364
Well, it looks like
it was deliberately cut.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.575
Anyone wanna harm you, Brandi Lynne?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.827
You mean besides me right now?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.498
I should've known you were up to something
when you showed up out of the blue.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.584
You don't wanna spend time together,
you just wanna spend my money!

33:22.667 --> 33:23.752
I'm short on rent.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.171
Quit playing online poker, Brandi Lynne.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.925
I mean, what'd you do? Just rode up
and cut the radiator hose

33:30.008 --> 33:32.177
- right before you rang my doorbell?
- No.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.680
I looked in the window
and made sure you were home first.

33:35.764 --> 33:36.640
Ugh.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.767
You hillbilly whore!

33:38.850 --> 33:40.435
How dare you come over here...

33:40.519 --> 33:42.395
- Get off me!
- ...and try to milk your sister for money!

33:43.772 --> 33:45.482
You wanna suck on a teet? C'mere!

33:45.690 --> 33:48.026
Ow! Mother... balls!

33:48.109 --> 33:49.444
Alright, stop!

33:49.528 --> 33:51.404
Stop right now! Get off of me!

33:53.657 --> 33:57.327
You have ten minutes to pack your things.
I am calling you a tow truck,

33:57.410 --> 33:59.204
and I'm putting it on your tab.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.997
You crazy bitch!

34:02.415 --> 34:03.583
Crazy bitch!

34:06.419 --> 34:08.088
- Hi.
- Wow.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.422
That's your sister?

34:10.507 --> 34:11.382
Uh...

34:12.717 --> 34:14.886
Yeah, I'm sorry I lied before. I just...

34:16.596 --> 34:18.098
I didn't want you to think less of me.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.684
Ah, you kidding me? I'm hell impressed.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.353
You are so good at playing a socialite.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.313
No one would ever know that
underneath it all, you're still...

34:26.606 --> 34:28.525
- Um...
- Trailer trash?

34:29.275 --> 34:30.735
Hey, I would never say that.

34:33.487 --> 34:34.489
You just did.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.831
What do you think?
Not bad for trailer trash, huh?

34:44.331 --> 34:47.043
Don't you ever say that about yourself.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.505
Come here, take a look.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.967
How do you feel?

34:57.387 --> 34:59.889
Like the very best version of me.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.188
Did Captain Handsome
just call us trailer trash?

35:08.523 --> 35:11.484
Pretty much. And for the record,
my Bob would never do that.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.696
So don't you ever talk about
his sissy nuts again.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.323
I'm sorry.

35:19.409 --> 35:23.121
<i>For the first time, I had to wonder
if Coralee was right about Patty.</i>

35:23.204 --> 35:25.290
<i>Maybe there was something wrong with her.</i>

35:28.168 --> 35:31.796
<i>Then again, it was just a crush.
And honestly, who could blame her?</i>

35:32.881 --> 35:36.801
<i>I just needed to give her some space,
and it would all blow over.</i>

35:38.136 --> 35:41.973
<i>Unless... I had just sent her
running back to the enemy!</i>

35:50.440 --> 35:52.776
Patty! What are you doing?

35:52.942 --> 35:56.029
I'm going to Big Daddy's
with Roxy and Stella Rose.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.864
At least they care about me.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.199
I care about you.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.077
Stella Rose says you only care about
yourself, and you're a narcissist.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.412
She's lying!
She's just trying to get back at me.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.206
See? You're making it all about you.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.624
No, I...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.210
Patty! Patty!

36:10.293 --> 36:11.294
Oh...

36:19.386 --> 36:20.553
Whoo!

36:20.637 --> 36:24.182
To Patty!
You finally got rid of that loser coach.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.435
Congratulations. You just lost
an extra 180 pounds.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.940
Yeah, but now I don't have a coach.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.608
I don't know anything about this stuff.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.403
I could be your coach.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.948
I'd be happy to get back in the game
for someone like you.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.788
Do you promise that you're not using me
to get back at Bob?

36:47.330 --> 36:49.582
Cross my heart, sweetheart.
Has nothing to do with him.

36:49.666 --> 36:50.834
Smile like a winner!

36:57.006 --> 36:59.092
Girl, we gotta get you
some denim and a cowboy hat.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.010
Yeah.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.680
Should we get some shots, guys?
What do y'all say?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.014
Gotta go to the ladies room.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.517
Y'all take care of my girl while I'm gone.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.103
Will do.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.864
Suck it, Stella Rose!

37:23.783 --> 37:26.286
Oh, yay, drinks!

37:28.329 --> 37:29.414
Here you go.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.173
<i>If Stella Rose's interest in me
had nothing to do with Bob,</i>

37:38.381 --> 37:40.216
<i>then why did she send that picture?</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:43.595
<i>They had both played me.</i>

37:44.053 --> 37:46.222
<i>Which meant neither one of them cared.</i>

37:52.270 --> 37:53.855
<i>Was Roxy in on it too?</i>

37:54.939 --> 37:56.065
<i>Was it all a lie?</i>

37:56.149 --> 37:57.025
Alright, y'all.

37:57.150 --> 38:00.653
Last call for the All You can Eat
Crawfish Eating Competition.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.655
Let's go!

38:02.739 --> 38:06.117
<i>I needed a safe place.
Somewhere I felt comfortable.</i>

38:06.451 --> 38:09.037
- Where you going?
- To eat a shit ton of crawfish.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.458
Three, two, one, eat!

38:20.089 --> 38:23.051
Patty, my girls don't eat competitively.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.552
Good thing I'm not your girl then, huh?

38:24.636 --> 38:27.305
Oh, my God, she's disgusting!

38:27.597 --> 38:28.681
She'll make me look amazing.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.439
Good luck, honey.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.948
Oh, my God, you guys, I found Patty.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.616
She's blowing up on ShenaniCam.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.245
No, seriously,
she's literally blowing up on ShenaniCam.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.123
Oh...

38:55.124 --> 38:56.584
Ow. What's that hard thing?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.879
- Gross.
- You mean this?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.090
Don't worry, it's legal.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.009
I have a conceal and carry license.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.888
That... is so hot.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.113
Is it loaded?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.913
<i>It was such a relief to stuff my face.</i>

39:34.414 --> 39:36.416
<i>I didn't have to think about pageants,</i>

39:36.708 --> 39:39.002
<i>or Stella Rose, or Bob.</i>

39:40.712 --> 39:41.629
Patty, stop.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.466
Why?
I thought you wanted me to be a winner.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.093
Unless you're just worried
about me getting fat.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.599
- Sorry sir, contestants only.
- Better get me a bib then.

39:52.682 --> 39:53.516
Alright.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.185
- What are you doing?
- Making sure you listen.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.729
We both know where this leads.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.565
It starts with some crawfish,
but then you feel guilty,

40:00.773 --> 40:02.901
so you eat a box of donuts
to make yourself feel better.

40:02.984 --> 40:05.778
The next thing you know,
you're at the drive-thru five times a day,

40:05.862 --> 40:08.072
eating a whole stick of butter
in the dark.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.742
- Wow, you did that?
- We are the same, Patty.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.328
That is why I wanna coach you.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.706
You're the only person I've ever met
who's just as hungry as me.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.795
Prove it.
Actions speak louder than words.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.757
Show me that you can win this thing
and I'll trust you.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.302
Volume eating is a slippery slope
for both of us.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.639
I'm willing to risk it all for you.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.475
Show me you're willing
to risk it all for me too.

40:37.977 --> 40:41.439
I do this,
and you actually start listening to me.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.193
Somebody bring me some crawfish!

40:51.824 --> 40:53.201
Whoo!

41:47.171 --> 41:48.506
Winner!

41:52.093 --> 41:52.927
I knew it.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.513
We are soul mates.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.015
I think I need to throw up.

41:58.057 --> 41:58.933
Citizen's arrest!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.018
- Dixie, wait!
- Gun!

42:02.562 --> 42:04.939
Stop right there, you...

42:11.571 --> 42:14.157
You, me, outside, now.

42:18.786 --> 42:22.582
Did you really think Patty was ever gonna
leave me for you?

42:22.665 --> 42:25.418
No. I know how young women react to you.

42:26.252 --> 42:27.336
I used to be one.

42:27.420 --> 42:30.590
If you weren't trying to steal Patty,
then what were you up to?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.508
I thought this was all about revenge.

42:32.592 --> 42:35.553
Oh, it was. Just not how you think.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.348
You thought you were coming down here
so I'd help you get an edge.

42:40.141 --> 42:44.562
You gave me the edge, because now
I've seen all Patty's weaknesses,

42:44.729 --> 42:45.646
and yours.

42:46.439 --> 42:48.608
You're the only competition
I've ever been worried about.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.109
And now,

42:51.027 --> 42:53.112
I know exactly how to beat you.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.949
Beat me? I thought
you weren't coaching anymore.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.285
Oh, I am getting back into coaching,

42:59.660 --> 43:00.870
just not with your girl.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.081
Remember Roxy?

43:03.915 --> 43:07.418
I'm gonna to take her all the way
to Miss American Lady.

43:08.169 --> 43:10.213
We're gonna ruin you, baby.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.599
I know you're in love with Bob.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.978
- What? No, I'm not...
- I know.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.647
Because I was too.

43:29.232 --> 43:31.234
We had an affair 20 years ago.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.444
He gave me this necklace.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.280
Now I'm giving it to you.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.700
You know what to do.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.080
<i>It was like manna from heaven.</i>

43:44.705 --> 43:47.458
<i>Stella Rose wasn't my competition.</i>

43:48.376 --> 43:50.044
<i>She was my ammunition.</i>

43:50.753 --> 43:54.924
<i>To break up Bob's marriage,
and have him all to myself.</i>
