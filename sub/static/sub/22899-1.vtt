33:11.920 --> 33:15.303
[Lernert] Now, pick a direction,
walk ten paces and try again.

33:51.753 --> 33:54.308
[Lernert] You've just gotta
keep trying until you find it.

Don't worry,
the feeling you get when

33:56.758 --> 33:59.347
the water starts flowing
makes it all worth it.

34:34.726 --> 34:35.866
Lernert!

34:37.592 --> 34:38.661
Lernert!

34:40.250 --> 34:41.838
There's something out there.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.495
-What do you mean?
-There's something out there.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.152
There's... there's something
reflecting the light.

34:45.186 --> 34:46.291
I want to see what it is.

34:46.324 --> 34:47.706
Did you get water?

34:48.638 --> 34:49.570
No.

34:51.192 --> 34:52.400
Running off to track down

34:52.435 --> 34:54.471
something shiny without
water in your canteen

34:54.505 --> 34:56.404
is asking for trouble.

34:56.438 --> 34:57.923
First, you fill your canteen

34:57.957 --> 34:59.718
then you run off
on an adventure.

[spout gurgling]

35:36.168 --> 35:39.861

35:56.878 --> 35:58.639
Not thirsty.

35:58.673 --> 35:59.916
You will be.

36:36.435 --> 36:37.747
[Rola] You ready?

36:38.472 --> 36:39.576
[Lernert] Yep.

36:41.337 --> 36:42.510
[Rola sighs]

36:56.041 --> 36:58.285
Just keep walking
in the same direction?

36:58.319 --> 37:00.045
Better than walking in circles.

37:06.810 --> 37:07.673
Hey!

37:17.787 --> 37:19.616
-Give me your canteen.
-What for?

37:19.651 --> 37:20.824
I want to put
these leaves in it.

37:20.859 --> 37:22.999
-Are you crazy?
-Do you know what these are?

37:23.033 --> 37:24.034
Smell them.

37:26.554 --> 37:28.384
Tastes a million times better.

37:28.418 --> 37:29.833
Don't mess with drinking water.

37:29.868 --> 37:31.318
[Rola] Come on,
aren't you tired of

37:31.352 --> 37:33.699
drinking that dirty
metallic mug?

37:34.700 --> 37:37.047
Keeps me hydrated,
that's all that matters.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.843
Lernert, it's gross.

37:40.982 --> 37:43.709
Just... drop it in,

37:44.469 --> 37:46.574
shake it up and enjoy something.

37:50.233 --> 37:52.304
Here, I'll even try it.

37:52.339 --> 37:53.961
Just to prove to you it's safe.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.576
That's pretty good.

38:22.610 --> 38:24.094
It's so good, right?

38:29.686 --> 38:31.757

sand comes from?

40:19.693 --> 40:21.004
[Lernert] Time.

40:23.110 --> 40:26.458

of being beaten up

40:26.493 --> 40:28.529
by wind and water,

40:28.564 --> 40:30.911
all kinds of weather.

40:30.945 --> 40:35.156
Rock gets broken down
until it's almost nothing.

40:35.191 --> 40:37.642
And then, it's sand.

40:37.676 --> 40:40.299
It can be blown
all around the world

40:40.334 --> 40:43.371
because it's got no weight left.

40:43.406 --> 40:45.063
It's insignificant.

40:47.030 --> 40:50.862
Then, all those little grains

40:50.896 --> 40:55.038
get blown into this
big pile of insignificance

Crossed paths with anybody else?

You wanna walk
with us for a while?

[Rola] Um...

43:33.680 --> 43:35.164
Do you have any batteries?

-One minute.
-Hey, come on.

-Let's go in this direction.
-I wanna ask him something.

43:54.942 --> 43:56.392
He doesn't know anything,
leave him alone.

43:56.426 --> 43:57.531
Hey, excuse me.

43:58.359 --> 43:59.878
Can I ask you a question?

44:00.948 --> 44:04.227
I just wanted to ask you,
why are you out here?

44:08.887 --> 44:10.475
I didn't like where I was.

44:12.926 --> 44:14.444
I don't like where I am.

44:16.826 --> 44:18.345
So I keep walking.

44:53.069 --> 44:55.554
I don't like how
you were holding me back.

44:55.589 --> 44:57.315
I was trying to protect you.

44:57.349 --> 44:59.179
I don't think you
need to do that.

45:00.145 --> 45:01.215
Okay.

45:02.389 --> 45:04.598
Maybe we could
protect each other.

45:09.672 --> 45:11.053
Okay, Lernert.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.573
Okay, let's go.

45:17.093 --> 45:20.200
[Lernert] Hey. Did he
remind you of anyone?

45:21.201 --> 45:22.374
No.

45:22.409 --> 45:24.963
[Lernert] Everybody
reminds me of somebody.

45:24.998 --> 45:26.827
That guy reminded me
of the neighbor I had

45:26.862 --> 45:28.415
when I was a kid.

45:28.449 --> 45:30.969
He was always
trimming his bushes.

45:31.004 --> 45:33.523
Trim them until there was
nothing left but twigs.

45:34.973 --> 45:36.457
[Rola] Who do I remind you of?

45:36.492 --> 45:38.356
[Lernert] You actually
remind me of my mother.

45:38.390 --> 45:41.324
-[Rola] Your mother?
-This way or this way?

45:45.812 --> 45:47.710
[Rola] Do you like your mother?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.056
[Lernert] Sure I do.

45:49.091 --> 45:50.506
Who doesn't like their mother?

[Rola] I don't know.

kind of hate their mother.

Like me.

45:54.855 --> 45:55.891
[Lernert] Yeah.

45:55.925 --> 45:57.582
My mother hated her mother, too,

[Rola] See?
Mothers aren't for everyone.

walking and talking,

the more familiar they become.

Eventually, they stop
being strangers.

It doesn't matter.

56:55.204 --> 56:57.379
[Susan] Please don't
keep things from me.

56:58.276 --> 57:00.106
I'm here to help you.

57:00.140 --> 57:03.109
I know, I just...
It was a long time ago.

57:03.143 --> 57:05.456
I don't remember
what I traded it for.

57:05.491 --> 57:06.871
[Susan] It is okay.

57:06.906 --> 57:09.874
You don't remember
because you are human.

57:09.909 --> 57:12.601
Humans forget things
all the time.

57:28.134 --> 57:29.825
Thank you, Lernert.

57:29.860 --> 57:31.655
[Lernert] You're welcome, Susan.

57:35.728 --> 57:39.973
[Susan] We need to
adjust our heading
five degrees to the right.

57:43.494 --> 57:46.359
Very good. Continue on course.

57:48.948 --> 57:51.709
Adjust three degrees
to the left.

57:55.057 --> 57:58.198
Adjust four degrees
to the right.

58:04.929 --> 58:08.070
Adjust 0.7 degrees to the left.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.351
Very good. Continue on course.

58:19.254 --> 58:22.844
If possible,
you should avoid steep hills.

58:29.782 --> 58:33.164
Now would be an optimal time
to stop and rehydrate.

58:39.619 --> 58:44.037
Lernert, you should ingest
an additional 300 calories.

58:45.556 --> 58:47.903
Rola,

58:47.938 --> 58:51.355
you should ingest
an additional 200 calories.

58:54.151 --> 58:55.117
[Rola] Susan,

58:56.325 --> 58:58.776
why do you think
you know what we need?

58:58.811 --> 59:02.469
[Susan] I have 5,474 algorithms

59:02.504 --> 59:05.749
processing the 15,982 variables

59:05.783 --> 59:08.752
affecting the two of you
at any one nanosecond.

59:08.786 --> 59:11.755
I'm not thinking.
I'm computing.

59:11.789 --> 59:13.895
She has it down to a science.

59:13.929 --> 59:15.275
What if I'm not hungry?

59:19.486 --> 59:20.522
[Rola] Susan,

59:21.730 --> 59:23.387
when you weren't
connected to a battery,

59:23.421 --> 59:25.216
did you know it?

59:25.251 --> 59:27.667
[Susan] I do not
understand the question.

59:27.702 --> 59:30.532
Were you aware that...
that you were off?

59:30.567 --> 59:31.671
[Lernert] No, she didn't know.

59:31.706 --> 59:33.397
[Susan] That is not
entirely correct.

59:33.431 --> 59:36.365
I have an internal clock that has never stopped running

59:36.400 --> 59:39.645
since the instant you first
loaded my operating system.

59:39.679 --> 59:41.923
When I am not connected
to a power source,

59:41.957 --> 59:44.373
I do not process
any new information,

59:44.408 --> 59:48.481
but upon being rebooted,
I am instantaneously aware

59:48.515 --> 59:49.965
of the empty interval of time

59:50.000 --> 59:52.312
when no new information
was collected.

59:52.347 --> 59:54.660
So you didn't know
you were off at the time.

59:54.694 --> 59:55.937
You knew afterwards.

59:55.971 --> 59:57.870
But if the clock inside her
was always ticking,

59:57.904 --> 59:59.457
then a part of her is always on.

59:59.492 --> 01:00:01.252
[Susan] That is true.

01:00:01.287 --> 01:00:02.288
What are you getting at?

01:00:02.322 --> 01:00:05.360
I don't know, I just...
She said she missed you.

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:13.126
[Susan] Lernert, be sure
to consume enough liquids

01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:15.301
before you resume walking.

01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:35.183
[Susan narrating]
The desert can be
a difficult place.

01:00:38.565 --> 01:00:40.533
It is best to plan

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.569
and prepare

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:45.124
and minimize risk.

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.991
But that is only
if you wish to survive.

01:01:52.985 --> 01:01:54.503
[Lernert] I love that you
found one of these.

01:01:54.538 --> 01:01:55.746
They're my favorite.

01:01:55.781 --> 01:01:58.611
Prophilium turnip.
Hard to come by.

01:02:07.896 --> 01:02:10.554
We traveled
39.1 kilometers today.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:13.626
Susan keeping track?

01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:17.457
What else can you do?

01:02:17.492 --> 01:02:21.220
[Susan] Efficiency of energy
is the primary operation.

01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:25.880
My functions are designed
to optimize solitary travel.

01:02:25.914 --> 01:02:27.778
You used to have a body, right?

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:29.193
[Susan] Yes.

01:02:29.228 --> 01:02:30.850
And you would walk with Lernert?

01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:32.576
-[Susan] Of course I would.
-[Rola laughs]

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:34.060
[Susan] Every single day.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:39.790
On average, how many kilometers
did you use to walk per day?

01:02:39.825 --> 01:02:41.343
[Susan] When my body
was functional,

01:02:41.378 --> 01:02:44.968
the average kilometers
traveled per day was 2.9.

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:48.523
You didn't used to walk as much.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:49.973
Hardly at all.

01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:52.630
Why not?

01:02:52.665 --> 01:02:54.805
[Susan] Conservation of energy.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.393
Walking was only necessary

01:02:56.427 --> 01:02:59.051
for the replenishing
of food and water.

01:03:00.328 --> 01:03:02.537
If I didn't walk
every day, I'd...

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:06.299
[sighs] I'd be miserable.

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:09.268
[Susan] Rola,
it is a matter of safety.

01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:11.822
Walking uses calories
at a higher rate,

01:03:11.857 --> 01:03:14.514
thus requiring
a larger food supply.

01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:17.276
Well, then, you just
dig up more roots.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.796
[Susan] The average
distribution of edible flora

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:20.935
across this desert

01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:23.523
is 19 kilograms
per square kilometer.

01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:24.835
The amount of calories

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.079
contained within
this edible material

01:03:27.113 --> 01:03:29.633
is 15 percent greater
than the amount of calories

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:32.222
required to locate,
prepare and ingest it.

01:03:32.256 --> 01:03:34.534
This does not leave
enough excess energy

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:37.123
to justify any walking
that does not result in

01:03:37.158 --> 01:03:39.229
additional food
being collected.

01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:41.265
So too much walking
is dangerous?

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.888
[Susan] There is
no way to be certain

01:03:42.922 --> 01:03:44.441
that more food will be located

01:03:44.475 --> 01:03:45.822
on any given day.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:49.239
My recommendations
account for this uncertainty.

01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.312
What recommendations
do you have for us

01:03:53.346 --> 01:03:54.554
after today?

01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:58.558
[Susan] I have reported my recommendations to Lernert.

01:03:58.593 --> 01:04:01.251
She says, chances are
we're not going to make it.

01:04:09.155 --> 01:04:12.227
Not... Not going to make it?

01:04:13.332 --> 01:04:15.230
She says,

01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:16.645
[sighs] the direction
we're headed

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.925
has an even lower percentage
of flora, so...

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.167
there's a high probability

01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:23.307
that we won't have
enough food to get there.

01:04:23.342 --> 01:04:25.447
Then... then we'll just...

01:04:25.482 --> 01:04:27.346
We'll just dig up
all we can find right now.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.279
-Right.
-And we'll keep
digging as we go.

01:04:29.313 --> 01:04:31.350
Right. She factors that in, too.

01:04:35.423 --> 01:04:38.944
But... these are
all just predictions

01:04:38.978 --> 01:04:40.221
based on her calculations.

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:42.499
She doesn't
actually know anything.

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:51.128
So... we don't have to
follow her recommendations.

01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:54.614
No.

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.490
Are you okay with that?

01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:16.740
Yeah, I think so.

01:05:54.778 --> 01:05:57.850
[Susan] Adjust
three degrees to the left.

01:06:01.923 --> 01:06:03.235
Lernert?

01:06:04.822 --> 01:06:05.858
Lernert?

01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:12.554
Only one of you is necessary to retrieve water.

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:15.350
One of you should be
conserving energy.

01:06:16.593 --> 01:06:17.766
[Rola grunting]

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:21.253
[sighs]

01:06:21.287 --> 01:06:23.255
[Susan] The probability of these being

01:06:23.289 --> 01:06:25.947
poisonous dactyl roots
is 82 percent.

01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:39.892
Your energy would be
better spent resting.

01:06:51.421 --> 01:06:52.629
Be sure to ration

01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:55.459
the rest of
your prophilium turnip, Rola.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:18.413
[Rola] Need water soon.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:19.371
Rola, let's keep walking.

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:21.856
[Rola] Seriously, where does
all this stuff come from?

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:24.307
[Lernert] Rola, if we can't
eat it, we don't need it.

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.481
[Rola] That was a good rhyme.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:31.279
There's some
good stuff out here.

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:33.799
[hissing]

01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:37.595
This is a perfect elbow.

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.460
[Lernert] This is
a waste of time.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.048
Susan,

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:44.361
would you call building you
a body a waste of time?

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:45.880
[Susan] Building a body for me

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:49.263
is not essential to the current primary objective.

01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:51.196
[Rola] What's the current
primary objective?

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:53.162
[Susan] The current
primary objective

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:55.441
is reaching the crystal lake.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.341
I disagree.

01:08:59.549 --> 01:09:01.309
You don't want to find the lake?

01:09:01.344 --> 01:09:04.692
[Rola] Of course I do,
but it's not my current
primary objective.

01:09:05.348 --> 01:09:06.728
Then what is?

01:09:07.384 --> 01:09:08.523
To be happy.

01:09:09.247 --> 01:09:10.594
"To be happy."

01:09:11.112 --> 01:09:12.665
Yep.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.046
Well, if you're going
to frame it so broadly,

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:18.292
I would say a more important
primary objective is survival.

01:09:18.326 --> 01:09:19.569
That's what mine is.

01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:21.984
It always has been
and it always will be.

01:09:24.608 --> 01:09:28.439
Lernert, do you
want to be happy?

01:09:28.474 --> 01:09:30.269
-That's a stupid question.
-No, it isn't.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:32.098
Do you want to be happy?

01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:35.585
I mean... of course.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:38.139
I want to be happy.
Who doesn't want to be happy?

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.486
Susan, do you want to be happy?

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.765
[Susan] Happiness is not
part of my programming.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.939
There's somebody.

01:09:45.491 --> 01:09:47.078
She's a robot.

01:09:48.943 --> 01:09:50.151
Susan,

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.429
you said you missed Lernert
when you didn't have power.

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:54.949
Did that make you sad?

01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:56.778
[Susan] I am
programmed to miss Lernert

01:09:56.813 --> 01:09:59.919
when powered down
for more than 96 hours.

01:09:59.954 --> 01:10:03.060
Sadness is not part
of my programming.

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:27.084
Lernert?

01:10:35.196 --> 01:10:36.542
-Lernert?
-What?

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.723
[Rola] Please sit down.

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:47.035
We should really
just keep walking.

01:10:48.382 --> 01:10:49.590
[Rola] Just sit.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.951
Lernert?

01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:08.229
Yes.

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:20.137
[Rola] I like you.

01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:25.936
I like walking with you,
and I like talking with you

01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:28.318
and I like the book
you're writing, and...

01:11:28.353 --> 01:11:31.459
I like your knowledge
about plants, and...

01:11:32.218 --> 01:11:33.530
I like the way your eye squints

01:11:33.565 --> 01:11:35.532
whenever I'm saying
something that

01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:38.224
you don't entirely
agree with. [laughs]

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:43.126
And I like
the simple way you cook

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.748
and I like

01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:46.612
the way you snore for
the first few minutes

01:11:46.647 --> 01:11:48.442
after falling asleep.

01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:50.236
-I snore?
-Yes, and I like it.

01:11:50.271 --> 01:11:52.791
And I like you. And I just...
I want you to know that.

01:11:53.826 --> 01:11:55.241
[Lernert]
You want me to know that?

01:11:57.761 --> 01:11:59.694
What don't you understand?

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:05.528
Why are you saying these things?

01:12:05.562 --> 01:12:07.564
[Rola] Because it's true.

01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:10.567
And...

01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:13.708
And you didn't have
to program me to say any of it.

01:12:35.523 --> 01:12:36.593
You know what?

01:12:36.628 --> 01:12:39.734
I'll carry Susan for a while.

01:12:40.286 --> 01:12:41.667
[exhales]

01:12:44.118 --> 01:12:45.222
All right.

01:13:07.072 --> 01:13:11.041
[Susan] Rola, if possible,
you should avoid steep hills.

01:13:11.076 --> 01:13:14.597
[Rola] Thank you for
the recommendation, Susan.

01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:16.599
It shows you care.

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.808
[Susan] You are welcome, Rola.

01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:33.616
[Susan narrating]
Lernert did not
program me to dream.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:36.826
He did not think of it.

01:13:37.827 --> 01:13:40.139
And he would not
have known how,

01:13:40.174 --> 01:13:41.589
even if he did.

01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:47.284
[Lernert] Susan,
is there a less direct route

01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:49.114
that would require less energy?

01:13:50.253 --> 01:13:51.944
[Susan] No, there is not.

01:13:53.981 --> 01:13:56.535
[Rola] What if we
take smaller steps?

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.779
[Susan] That would
not make a difference.

01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:00.574
[Rola] What about bigger steps?

01:14:00.608 --> 01:14:03.024
[Susan] That also would
not make a difference.

01:14:03.059 --> 01:14:05.579
[Lernert] All right, Susan,
then what do you suggest?

01:14:05.613 --> 01:14:07.132
We can't turn back now.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:11.964
[Susan] I am still unable
to come up with a solution,

01:14:11.999 --> 01:14:15.830
except locating edible flora
as soon as possible.

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:19.144
[Lernert] Guess we'll
keep walking, then.

01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:22.699
What direction now?

01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:25.322
[Susan]
Forty-five degrees
to the right.

01:14:27.566 --> 01:14:29.119
[Rola] We'll find something.

01:14:51.694 --> 01:14:53.109
[Lernert] This looks different.

01:14:59.633 --> 01:15:01.013
[Rola] Can we eat it?

01:15:02.325 --> 01:15:03.740
I can't say. Susan,

01:15:03.775 --> 01:15:05.121
can you tell me what this is?

01:15:07.364 --> 01:15:09.884
[Susan] I am unable
to properly identify

01:15:09.919 --> 01:15:11.852
this specific species of flora.

01:15:11.886 --> 01:15:14.544
However, the yellow skin
and pink pattern

01:15:14.579 --> 01:15:16.891
closely resembles
the pomble beet.

01:15:16.926 --> 01:15:18.306
[Rola] What's a pomble beet?

01:15:19.722 --> 01:15:22.414
It's an extremely
poisonous root.

01:15:22.448 --> 01:15:24.209
Yellow skin and pink stripes.

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:29.663
[Rola] This has pink spots,
not stripes, it's...

01:15:29.697 --> 01:15:32.251
Sorry, Rola, it's too dangerous.

01:15:32.286 --> 01:15:35.392
If you eat a pomble beet,
you're dead within 30 seconds.

01:15:37.947 --> 01:15:41.329
Susan, how many days
till we reach the crystal lake?

01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:42.641
[Susan] That depends.

01:15:42.676 --> 01:15:44.367
Over the previous six days,

01:15:44.401 --> 01:15:46.990
your average walking speed
has decreased.

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:48.785
If this trend continues,

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.580
it will be at least eight days

01:15:50.615 --> 01:15:52.893
until you reach
the crystal lake.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.501
What are you doing?

01:16:16.468 --> 01:16:17.918
Susan, count to 30.

01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:20.921
[Susan] One, two, three...

01:16:20.955 --> 01:16:22.370
-Rola, spit it out!
-[Susan] ...four...

01:16:22.405 --> 01:16:23.958
-You should
get your pellets out.
-[Susan] ...five...

01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:25.581
-in case this doesn't work.
-[Susan] ...six, seven...

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:27.306
-No, pellets aren't
strong enough!
-[Susan] ...eight, nine...

01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:29.239
-Rola, you need
to throw it up.
-[Susan] ...ten, eleven...

01:16:29.274 --> 01:16:31.103
-But there is a chance
that this isn't poisonous.
-[Susan] ...12, 13...

01:16:31.138 --> 01:16:34.106
-And if it isn't we have
all the food that we need.
-[Susan] ...14, 15, 16...

01:16:34.141 --> 01:16:36.246
-And if it is poisonous,
you'll die!
-[Susan] ...17, 18...

01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:38.594
-Rola, there's a smarter way
to go about things.
-[Susan] ...19, 20...

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.630
-What would be
a smarter way, Lernert?
-[Susan] ...21, 22, 23...

01:16:40.665 --> 01:16:42.632
-Waiting till we find another
kernyptus root?
-[Susan] ...24, 25...

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:44.600
-We haven't found
anything for a week.
-[Susan] ...26...

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:48.949
-You could have at least
taken a smaller bite!
-[Susan] ...27, 28, 29, 30.

01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:02.997
You're all right? You feel...

01:17:04.171 --> 01:17:05.275
You feel good?

01:17:06.242 --> 01:17:07.174
Healthy?

01:17:09.383 --> 01:17:10.902
I feel fine, Lernert.

01:17:12.075 --> 01:17:13.318
[Lernert] That was...

01:17:14.768 --> 01:17:16.839
Rola, that was...

01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:20.014
[Susan] It appears
the flora is not pomble beet.

01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:32.820
What's your favorite color?

01:17:33.787 --> 01:17:35.685
-Hmm?
-Green?

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.962
[Lernert] Beige.

01:17:37.756 --> 01:17:40.034
-[Rola] Beige?
-Mm-hmm.

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:44.073
[Lernert] What's yours?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.461
[Rola] Hmm... blue.

01:17:54.428 --> 01:17:55.601
[Lernert] Why?

01:17:59.191 --> 01:18:01.573
[Rola] 'Cause every
shade of blue is pretty.

01:18:02.954 --> 01:18:05.059
We're like the sky and the sand.

01:18:05.094 --> 01:18:06.336
[laughs]

01:18:09.305 --> 01:18:12.411
[Susan narrating]
In the desert,
it is easy to get lost.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:17.589
The dunes can look alike.

01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:21.006
And the steps you took
to get somewhere, disappear.

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:28.358
But with good direction,
you can find your way.

01:19:11.332 --> 01:19:14.611
[panting]

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:16.579
[Lernert] I don't believe it.

01:19:16.613 --> 01:19:18.408
[Susan] Lernert, believe it.

01:19:27.003 --> 01:19:29.178
[Rola squeals in delight]

01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:34.148
Lernert! Lernert!

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.913
[Susan]
Lernert, you should test

01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:42.294
the toxicity levels
of the water.

01:19:44.503 --> 01:19:45.504
Without proper testing,

01:19:45.539 --> 01:19:48.162
I cannot verify
that it is safe.

01:19:55.894 --> 01:19:58.207
[birds chirping]

01:20:09.874 --> 01:20:12.669
[serene music playing]

01:21:09.036 --> 01:21:12.039
[serene music playing]

01:21:42.311 --> 01:21:44.071
It's so beautiful.

01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:50.560
[Susan narrating]
When you reach
your destination,

01:21:50.595 --> 01:21:54.599
the challenge becomes
knowing what to do next.

01:22:44.994 --> 01:22:46.340
[Lernert] Susan.

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:48.653
[Susan] Yes, Lernert?

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:51.483
Thank you for all your help.

01:22:52.795 --> 01:22:55.418
We couldn't have
found the lake without you.

01:22:56.695 --> 01:22:57.903
[Susan] You are welcome.

01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:50.749
[Lernert] There's programming in here that I didn't program.

01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:54.512
Residual traces of code

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:57.653
from those replacement parts
I was finding in the desert.

01:24:00.276 --> 01:24:02.140
One of the memory chips

01:24:02.175 --> 01:24:04.591
had the coordinates
of the crystal lake.

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.561
[Rola] So someone else
was here, too.

01:24:24.818 --> 01:24:25.784
[Lernert] Hi, Susan.

01:24:25.819 --> 01:24:28.925
[Susan]
Hello, Lernert. Hello, Rola.

01:24:30.134 --> 01:24:32.964
I've altered some of
your programming.

01:24:32.998 --> 01:24:34.552
A few things are different.

01:24:35.932 --> 01:24:39.315
You'll be able to set
your own primary objective now.

01:24:40.144 --> 01:24:41.455
And...

01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:46.288
And you won't miss me
automatically any more.

01:24:48.152 --> 01:24:49.843
[Susan] What about my body?

01:24:53.191 --> 01:24:55.262
I owe you an apology, Susan.

01:24:55.297 --> 01:24:56.746
[Susan] For what?

01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:02.649
I was never actually
building you a new body.

01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:06.825
Not really.

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.344
[Susan] You lied to me.

01:25:09.173 --> 01:25:10.622
[Lernert] Yes, I lied.

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:12.969
[Susan] Why?

01:25:14.385 --> 01:25:16.214
[Lernert] I was afraid.

01:25:16.249 --> 01:25:17.974
[Susan] Afraid of what?

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.634
Of being alone.

01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:26.500
[Susan] Lernert,
I would not leave you alone.

01:25:28.433 --> 01:25:31.333
And you did not
program me to say that.

01:25:35.889 --> 01:25:38.512
[Rola] Susan, what kind
of body do you want?

01:25:38.547 --> 01:25:40.445
[Susan]
I want a body that can walk

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.345
for at least six days
in a row without stopping,

01:25:43.379 --> 01:25:46.313
and can climb
a sand dune 30 meters high

01:25:46.348 --> 01:25:50.179
and can carry over
100 kilograms of supplies.

01:25:50.214 --> 01:25:52.802
And... and...

01:25:54.425 --> 01:25:56.737
I want a body that can swim.

01:26:20.244 --> 01:26:21.314
[Lernert] I think
I've figured out

01:26:21.348 --> 01:26:22.832
the ending of my book.

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:26.560
Would you like to hear it?

01:26:27.872 --> 01:26:29.080
[Rola] Mm-hmm.

01:26:30.426 --> 01:26:31.772
[Lernert] Well...

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.016
Todd, the Samurai,

01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:36.674
sacrifices his life
for the king,

01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:39.953
and his dead body rests
on a wooden table.

01:26:43.922 --> 01:26:46.546
-Todd, dies?
-Mm-hmm.

01:26:48.444 --> 01:26:52.586
The king, his servants,
the medicine man,

01:26:52.621 --> 01:26:54.519
they're all standing
around the table,

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:57.798
their heads bowed in respect.

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:02.424
Suddenly, the doors open,

01:27:03.252 --> 01:27:06.117
and in walks Lady Ree.

01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:11.087
She strides over to the table,

01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:15.230
and connects a golden tube,

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:18.509
from her chest to Todd's.

01:27:20.304 --> 01:27:23.168
The tube begins to glow,

01:27:23.203 --> 01:27:26.551
and Todd's eyes open up.

01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:29.623
He's alive again.

01:27:30.659 --> 01:27:33.593
-So Todd doesn't die?
-No.

01:27:34.766 --> 01:27:37.597
And everyone is amazed
at what they've just seen.

01:27:38.563 --> 01:27:41.497
A man has been
brought back to life.

01:27:48.193 --> 01:27:49.574
The end.

[laughing]

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.086
[Susan narrating] We stayed
by the water for six weeks.

01:28:20.156 --> 01:28:22.435
Then we turned to the cities

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:25.472
and told others
about what we found.

01:28:28.372 --> 01:28:30.546
We talked about
the soothing waves,

01:28:31.167 --> 01:28:32.962
the fresh water,

01:28:32.997 --> 01:28:34.688
the fish to eat,

01:28:34.723 --> 01:28:37.726
and the high levels
of moisture in the air.

01:28:38.692 --> 01:28:41.350
Many people did not believe us.

01:28:41.385 --> 01:28:42.903
But some did.

01:28:42.938 --> 01:28:46.976
And I led the believers
across the dunes.

01:28:47.011 --> 01:28:51.153
The community at the lake
now has over 200 residents,
