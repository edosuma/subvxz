02:55.041 --> 02:58.408
- All right, let's play some ball!
- Swing it in here.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.739
- Strike!
- ln what league?

03:02.815 --> 03:07.047
Quit complaining. We already had to move
home plate cos you bitched about the mud.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.610
Nice pitch.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.179
Come on, let him hear some chin music.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.427
Throw a fastball!

03:19.966 --> 03:21.900
- Nice hit.
- Go get it!

03:28.675 --> 03:32.304
- Hey, come on!
- lt went on the Peacocks' property.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.752
Here's another one!

03:42.855 --> 03:45.323
Come on, let's play!

03:47.660 --> 03:52.154
Come on, baby, bring it home to Momma.
Come on, right here.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.831
Come on, baby. Bring it home.
Come on, right here.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.969
That's it. Ease up. Come on.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.982
Get to it.

05:01.267 --> 05:06.796
Compression marks indicate the shovel
blade to be approximately 63/4 inches.

05:06.873 --> 05:12.743
The deeper indentation on the right side of
the mark suggests a left-handed individual.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.544
l've collected soil specimens,

05:15.615 --> 05:19.312
and, although numerous shoe impressions
remain from the game,

05:19.385 --> 05:25.517
l think dental-stone casts
will prove invaluable to the investigation.

05:27.694 --> 05:31.186
And l've quit the FBl and become
a spokesperson for the Ab Roller.

05:31.264 --> 05:35.564
Smell that. lt's perfume. Eau de ball.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.728
God, this brings back
a lot of memories of my sister.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.865
All-day games out on the vineyard,

05:41.941 --> 05:44.933
ride your bikes to the beach,
eat bologna sandwiches...

05:45.011 --> 05:47.172
Only place you had to be on time was dinner.

05:47.246 --> 05:50.943
Never had to lock your doors.
No modems, no faxes, no cell phones.

05:51.017 --> 05:56.956
lf you had to do without a cell phone,
you'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia.

05:57.256 --> 06:01.317
You don't know me as well as you think.
My work demands that l live in a big city,

06:01.394 --> 06:04.886
but if l had to settle down, build a home,
it'd be a place like this.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.626
lt'd be like living in Mayberry.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.127
Agents Mulder and Scully?

06:10.937 --> 06:13.701
Hi. l'm Sheriff Andy Taylor.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.772
For real?

06:14.841 --> 06:20.711
Can't thank you or the Bureau enough for
comin' out. lt's just me and my deputy and...

06:20.780 --> 06:24.511
Hell, we never had anything of this nature.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.781
Do you have any thoughts or suspects?

06:27.854 --> 06:32.882
Population of Home is only a few hundred.
Everybody knows everybody, pretty much.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.360
Any local women who were pregnant
and now suddenly aren't?

06:36.696 --> 06:40.757
No. l just saw Mary Ellen and Nancy.
They're both doin' fine.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.361
Hey, Sheriff, who lives in that house there?

06:48.374 --> 06:51.241
Did you question them?

06:52.945 --> 06:54.810
Cos they've been watchin' us.

06:54.881 --> 06:58.248
That farm belongs to the Peacock family.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.878
Three boys now - well, men.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.452
Guess you could call them human.

07:04.524 --> 07:08.688
Their folks were in a bad car wreck.
We suppose they died.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.752
You suppose?

07:11.230 --> 07:15.223
We tried to administer medical attention,
but the boys hauled the bodies away,

07:15.301 --> 07:16.825
took 'em home.

07:16.903 --> 07:21.306
They haven't been seen in ten years,
so... we suppose they died.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.366
Have you questioned the men?

07:25.812 --> 07:29.304
The Peacocks built that farm
during the Civil War.

07:29.382 --> 07:33.443
lt still has no electricity,
no running water, no heat.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.714
They grow their own food.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.790
They raise their own pigs.
They breed their own cows.

07:41.294 --> 07:46.630
Raise and breed their own stock,
if you get my meaning.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.930
lt is, however, the closest residence
to the crime scene.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.796
Those boys are feeble, Agent Scully.

07:52.872 --> 07:56.035
And sad. They wouldn't know
what you were talking about.

07:56.108 --> 07:59.669
- They could have witnessed...
- Look, this town is my home.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.813
l love it.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.475
lt's quiet. Peaceful.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.382
l don't even wear a gun.

08:07.453 --> 08:14.188
l've seen and heard some of the sick and
horrible things that go on outside my home.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.787
At the same time,
l knew we couldn't stay hidden forever.

08:17.864 --> 08:23.530
That one day the modern world would find us
and my hometown would change forever.

08:24.136 --> 08:27.765
And when l saw... it... in the ground,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.400
l knew that day had come.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.808
Now l wanna find whoever did this.

08:33.880 --> 08:40.376
But, in doing so, l'd like it if the way things
are around here didn't have to change.

08:40.453 --> 08:45.288
l know this is iffy Bureau jurisdiction,
but l didn't know where else to turn.

08:45.358 --> 08:50.227
So l called the Bureau in Pittsburgh,
and when l described the victim,

08:50.296 --> 08:52.389
they said l should see you.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.558
We should take a look at the victim, then.

09:01.073 --> 09:03.564
We don't have a lab or a morgue.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.544
l've got a room down here,
might be a bit cleaner.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.138
By the way, this is my deputy, Barney.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.446
- Fife?
- Paster!

09:23.296 --> 09:26.823
l could use a bit more elbow room.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.767
The thing is, see, folks have been
dropping in to ask about the case,

09:30.836 --> 09:33.361
and l wouldn't want anybody
to pop in and see this.

09:33.439 --> 09:37.876
- You could just lock the door to the office.
- Folks know l never lock the door.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.679
They'd start rumors.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.212
Oh, my God.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.960
Mulder, it looks as if this child

09:56.028 --> 09:59.759
has been afflicted by every
rare birth defect known to science.

09:59.832 --> 10:02.630
l'll have to order DNA typing
from the crime lab,

10:02.702 --> 10:08.902
but there appears to be abnormalities
associated with Neu-Laxova Syndrome,

10:08.975 --> 10:13.605
Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, exstrophy of the
cloaca... l don't even know where to begin.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.546
l guess we can rule out murder
as the cause of death?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.775
l don't know about that.

10:25.591 --> 10:29.618
There's evidence of occlusion
due to dirt in the nose and mouth,

10:29.695 --> 10:32.721
indicating the dirt has been inhaled.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.324
There's something rotten in Mayberry.

10:39.205 --> 10:44.939
lmagine all a woman's hopes and dreams
for her child, and then nature turns so cruel.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.809
What must a mother go through?

10:47.880 --> 10:52.510
Apparently not much in this case,
if she'd just throw it out with the trash.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.050
l guess l was just projecting on myself.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.352
ls there a history of genetic
abnormalities in your family?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.863
No.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.866
Just find a man
with a spotless genetic makeup,

11:08.934 --> 11:14.873
a high tolerance for being second-guessed,
and start pumpin' out the little Ã¼ber-Scullys.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.176
What about your family?

11:20.479 --> 11:24.882
Aside from needing corrective lenses
and being abducted by extraterrestrials

11:24.950 --> 11:30.718
involved in a governmental conspiracy,
the Mulder family passes genetic muster.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.728
Scully, that child inside is a tragedy.

11:36.796 --> 11:41.733
Some young parents, probably scared kids,
disposed of an unwanted birth.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.965
ln a very certain sense, infanticide is
involved, but this is not an FBl matter.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.768
From what l know about genetic defects,

11:48.841 --> 11:52.277
that child isn't the result
of a single polygenic mating.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.608
Let the local authorities investigate that.

11:54.680 --> 11:58.377
Those defects
are autosomal-dominant disorders.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.751
And from the degree, l'd say
mutations that go back many generations.

12:02.822 --> 12:07.259
Scully, Sheriff Taylor implied
that the boys in that family

12:07.326 --> 12:10.295
were not the type
that could easily get dates.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.388
But he also implied
that they practice inbreeding.

12:13.466 --> 12:17.061
Now, we all have a natural instinct
to propagate.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.330
Do we?

12:18.404 --> 12:21.237
There are theories
which pose that our bodies

12:21.307 --> 12:24.936
are simply vehicles for genes
needing to replicate.

12:25.010 --> 12:31.279
Yeah, but there's no sister,
the mother's been dead for ten years...

12:31.350 --> 12:37.084
But if the instinct and need is strong enough,
they will answer it any way they can.

12:37.156 --> 12:42.788
Now a woman gave birth to that child,
Mulder, and, my guess is, against her will.

12:43.729 --> 12:46.596
And kidnapping is a Bureau matter.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.027
Scully...

12:53.639 --> 12:56.904
l never saw you as a mother before.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.660
No, there's no probable cause.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.910
They match.

14:57.763 --> 15:01.164
- This room alone should convict 'em.
- lf we can find them.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.259
They probably bolted
when they saw us coming.

15:07.907 --> 15:13.106
We'll alert Sheriff Taylor to get a warrant
for the brothers' arrest, put out an APB.

15:13.178 --> 15:16.705
And check any prior
missing persons for a woman.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.479
And check the vehicle identification
number on that Cadillac.

15:20.552 --> 15:24.283
lf the mother's alive,
they probably took her with them.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.058
l've issued descriptions and warrants
for George Raymond Peacock,

16:08.133 --> 16:10.465
approximate age, 30,

16:10.536 --> 16:13.266
Sherman Nathaniel Peacock,
approximate age, 26,

16:13.339 --> 16:16.069
and Edmund Creighton Peacock, 42.

16:16.141 --> 16:20.475
- What about missing persons reports?
- Deputy Paster's on it right now.

16:20.546 --> 16:25.347
Do you recall recently any vehicles
you found, thought to be abandoned,

16:25.417 --> 16:27.851
but which might belong to kidnap victims?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.980
We saw a white Cadillac
in the Peacocks'front yard.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.990
We get so many of those.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.652
A car breaks down, they move on.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.492
Well, we'll check on those in the morning.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.498
You get some sleep, Sheriff.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.667
You too, Miss Scully. Good night.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.360
Don't move, don't move.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.929
Damn.

18:18.997 --> 18:24.264
- You still planning on making a home here?
- Nah. Not if l can't get the Knicks game.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.794
Just as long as a brutal infanticide
doesn't weigh into your decision.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.138
- Good night, Mulder.
- Good night, Mom.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.514
Mulder, this lock is broken.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.679
You don't have to
lock your doors around here.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.640
Andy, what are you doing?

19:36.708 --> 19:41.975
Taking one good last look around...
before it all changes.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.208
Honey, come to bed?

19:45.651 --> 19:48.279
lt will still be here in the morning.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.159
Come on, honey.

20:35.300 --> 20:40.237
The eldest dominant male in the pack moves
in to ensure that the prey has been killed.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.365
Encircling the prey is a signal
to the others it is safe to...

21:15.140 --> 21:17.108
Andy, what is it?

21:17.342 --> 21:21.608
Hide, under the bed. l'm goin' for the gun.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.474
Big American car.

24:16.855 --> 24:22.760
l... l came over to give him these reports
and... and found them.

24:23.962 --> 24:27.625
The... the owner of the Cadillac was...

24:28.500 --> 24:31.435
was found and contacted in Baltimore.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.995
She ran out of gas
and just left the car on the 119.

24:35.073 --> 24:39.942
Other... possible missing persons
are in the file.

24:40.011 --> 24:44.107
And... this came
from Federal Crime Lab overnight.

24:45.183 --> 24:49.847
- Where are they?
- They're... inside.

24:56.361 --> 24:59.057
His chest is one big hematoma.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.991
There's wood shavings embedded
in what's left of the cranium.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.797
They really went caveman on 'em.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.906
Damn it. The lab screwed up
the DNA test on the infant.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.243
Multiple maldistribution, chromosomal
breakage, maldivision of the centromere.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.617
You suspected these abnormalities.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.555
Yeah, but this shows
far too many gene imbalances.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.388
lt would have to be a lab error.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.896
This child's cells would've had
to divide triple-fold in cell metaphase.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.261
Triple?

25:39.037 --> 25:43.940
Hey, Scully, what if each of the Peacock
brothers was the father of that child?

25:44.943 --> 25:48.902
Mulder, only one sperm in thousands
from a single individual

25:48.980 --> 25:52.347
can penetrate an ovum membrane.
Let alone from three separate males.

25:52.417 --> 25:56.376
What if generations of autosomal breeding
could produce such a mutation?

25:56.454 --> 26:00.618
No. For that to be possible, there'd have
to be a weakening of the ovum,

26:00.692 --> 26:05.561
and that would be from a female member
of the Peacock family. And there aren't any.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.124
Well, in any case,
they haven't ventured too far from home.

26:10.201 --> 26:12.931
We should request backups
from Pittsburgh and pick 'em up.

26:13.004 --> 26:16.235
That would take a whole day.
They may have a woman captive up there

26:16.308 --> 26:19.766
who may have sustained
life-threatening injuries while giving birth.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.904
Who knows what those men
have done to her. We should go there now.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.848
We're outnumbered.
We could further endanger the victim.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.045
l'll take you out there.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.612
Then it's three against three. And this...

26:34.459 --> 26:36.893
This should give us the advantage.

26:38.930 --> 26:42.593
That was just a little bit
too Chuck Bronson for me, Scully.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.931
Hang on a second, Mulder. Why...

26:45.003 --> 26:49.303
Why would they kill Sheriff Taylor? He didn't
even question them about the buried child.

26:49.374 --> 26:52.172
They probably heard about
the warrants for their arrest.

26:52.243 --> 26:56.111
But how would they know?
He issued the warrants by phone.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.911
Unless they heard us talking about it,
how would they know?

26:58.984 --> 27:03.250
- We searched that house. They weren't home.
- Exactly. How could they know?

27:08.426 --> 27:09.825
l'm hungry.

27:38.523 --> 27:41.083
All right. l'm ready.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.516
You look fine.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.354
They'll be comin' now.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.950
We knew this day was gonna happen.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.860
That they'd try to change the way things are.

28:18.930 --> 28:22.024
All we can do about changin' things

28:22.100 --> 28:24.227
is be ready for it.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.027
Be ready for them.

28:27.505 --> 28:30.633
Let 'em know this is our home

28:31.309 --> 28:34.540
and this is the way it's gonna stay.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.482
Yup, they're up there.

29:16.020 --> 29:20.980
l'll take the front. Their attention'll be taken by
the uniform. You can approach around back.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.556
Are these vests absolutely necessary,
Deputy?

29:26.631 --> 29:28.792
l've seen 'em fire muskets before.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.893
l, for one, am not gettin' taken out
by some antique.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.373
- This is Paster. l'm at the front of the house.
- We're getting into position.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.134
l don't see anybody inside.

30:44.209 --> 30:45.767
l'm going in.

31:13.738 --> 31:15.205
Paster, no!

31:23.681 --> 31:27.674
Paster's dead. The brothers moved in
like a pack of animals.

31:28.286 --> 31:30.777
The eldest will move in
to ensure the prey is dead.

31:30.855 --> 31:34.655
Encircling the prey is a signal
to the others that it's safe to approach.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.695
What we're witnessing
is undiluted animal behavior.

31:37.762 --> 31:41.858
Mankind, absent in its own creation of
civilization, technology and information,

31:41.933 --> 31:44.595
regressed to an almost prehistoric state,

31:44.669 --> 31:48.696
obeying only the often savage laws of nature.

31:49.674 --> 31:53.303
We're invading the den, trying to take
away their one chance at reproducing.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.346
Which we're gonna do.

31:55.413 --> 31:59.213
Even though we have the firearms,
l imagine the place is rigged with traps.

31:59.284 --> 32:02.481
Yeah, but we can try
and divert them out of the house.

32:24.909 --> 32:30.506
Scully, would you think less of me as a man
if l told you l was kind of excited right now?

32:30.581 --> 32:34.381
There some secret farmer trick
to gettin' these things moving?

32:35.853 --> 32:38.583
Naa-ram-ewe.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.283
Naa-ram-ewe.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.793
Yeah, that'll work.

32:43.861 --> 32:48.389
l babysat my nephew this weekend.
He watches Babe 15 times a day.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.299
And people call me spooky.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.422
Federal agents! ls anybody in here?

34:22.226 --> 34:25.286
FBl! ls anybody in this house?

34:27.165 --> 34:29.429
ls there anybody in here?

34:43.681 --> 34:45.774
Oh, no.

35:43.741 --> 35:46.437
- No! Get out of here! Go away!
- lt's all right, ma'am.

35:46.677 --> 35:50.113
- We're federal agents. We're here to help you.
- Get out! Go away!

35:50.181 --> 35:53.446
- Go away! Get away!
- Let's move the bed.

35:54.285 --> 35:58.278
They've got her strapped
to some kind of board or something.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.896
Take it easy, ma'am. lt's all right. lt's all over.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.269
We're from the FBl. We're here to help.

36:14.805 --> 36:19.435
We're gonna make sure that you're safe.
We're gonna make sure that you get home.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.141
Mulder, she already is home.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.155
lt's Mrs Peacock. She's their mother.

37:09.927 --> 37:13.522
- Where are you going?
- The others may have heard the screams.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.759
What about her?

37:15.833 --> 37:18.165
She's not going anywhere.

37:19.604 --> 37:22.004
We may not be able to remove her, Mulder.

37:22.073 --> 37:26.032
She doesn't appear to be held against
her will. l mean, l don't believe she is.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.544
l'm sure she's an accessory.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.707
We're only assuming.
We can't prove anything.

37:35.286 --> 37:41.122
The way l think it goes here is that Edmund
is the brother and father of the other two.

37:41.192 --> 37:46.494
So when Edmund was a kid, he could ground
the other two for playing with his things?

37:46.564 --> 37:50.625
The brothers killed three people.
Tell her we're gonna bring them in.

37:50.701 --> 37:55.331
And convince her that she's the one way
they can get out of this without getting hurt.

37:55.406 --> 37:58.398
l'm gonna keep an eye on them.

37:58.476 --> 38:00.569
Scully, watch your step.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.840
This place is rigged.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.999
Mrs Peacock?

38:35.346 --> 38:40.648
Mrs Peacock, you are
in immediate need of medical attention.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.879
Agent Mulder and l are here to help you.

38:43.954 --> 38:47.014
This is our home. Why leave it?

38:47.224 --> 38:50.921
- Whatever pain you may be in...
- l don't feel pain.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.057
Runs in the family.

38:54.131 --> 38:57.862
Have to check the boys,
see if they hurt themselves.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.263
What about you? Even after the accident?

39:03.074 --> 39:05.838
Right arm was torn off.

39:05.910 --> 39:10.438
Saw it sittin' there
across my dead husband's lap.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.506
Boys took me home,

39:13.584 --> 39:18.681
sewed me up, just like the family learnt
in the War of Northern Aggression.

39:20.091 --> 39:24.551
Whole time, felt the same
as if been makin' breakfast.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.559
They're such good boys.

39:30.935 --> 39:36.305
Mrs Peacock, they murdered Sheriff Taylor
and his wife and Deputy Paster.

39:38.109 --> 39:42.273
l can tell you don't have no children.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.106
Maybe one day you'll learn

39:46.183 --> 39:48.151
the pride,

39:48.219 --> 39:50.312
the love,

39:52.957 --> 39:57.291
when you know your boy
will do anythin' for his mother.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.401
Scully.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.908
Federal agent! l'm armed!

40:24.722 --> 40:26.656
Stop or l'll fire!

40:27.625 --> 40:28.455
Mulder!

41:06.497 --> 41:08.055
l've got the mother!

41:26.684 --> 41:29.517
Where's the other brother? Edmund?

41:30.921 --> 41:33.014
Mulder, look.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.684
Marks on the floor.

41:52.076 --> 41:54.442
l looked everywhere. They're gone.

41:54.512 --> 41:58.608
l've notified the state police and
the highway patrol. They've put out an APB

41:58.682 --> 42:02.550
and are setting up a roadblock
over a 30-mile radius.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.884
ln time, we'll catch 'em.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.950
l think time already caught them, Scully.

42:22.640 --> 42:27.077
There, there.
Sherman and George were good boys.

42:27.144 --> 42:29.078
We should be proud.

42:29.146 --> 42:33.913
And you got to know, Edmund,
you can't keep a Peacock down.

42:33.984 --> 42:36.077
There'll be more.

42:36.153 --> 42:39.418
One day, there'll be more.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.924
Now we have to move on,

42:41.992 --> 42:44.085
start a new family.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.254
One we'll be proud of.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.265
Find a new place to call ours.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.233
A new home.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.862
A brand-new home.
