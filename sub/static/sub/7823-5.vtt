00:21.870 --> 00:24.110
LISA'S MAKING THESE

00:32.210 --> 00:33.550
THESE ARE FOR LISA'S CLASS.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.440
IT'S MRS. HOOVER'S

A BAD THING.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.830
WELL, YOU SEE, BOY

00:47.890 --> 00:51.260
IT NEVER HURTS TO GREASE
THE WHEELS A LITTLE.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.800
I'M NOT GREASING WHEELS,

00:52.870 --> 00:54.100
I LIKE MY TEACHER.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.470
YOU SEE HOW IT WORKS, BART?

00:56.540 --> 00:58.910
A CUPCAKE HERE,
A GOOD GRADE THERE.

00:58.970 --> 01:01.040
DAD, I GET GOOD GRADES
BECAUSE I'M SMART

01:01.110 --> 01:02.880
AND I PAY ATTENTION
AND I STUDY HARD.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.280
YEAH RIGHT, LISA.

01:04.340 --> 01:07.070
IT'S THE THREE ROADS

01:22.860 --> 01:24.070
MY SISTER HERE MADE
A WHOLE PILE OF CUPCAKES

01:24.130 --> 01:25.970
TO BUTTER UP HER TEACHER

01:26.030 --> 01:29.270

THAT'S BAD NEWS, MAN.

01:50.390 --> 01:53.860
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I GOT UPSET.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.130
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT

01:55.190 --> 01:57.390
I SAID SOME THINGS
I DIDN'T MEAN.

01:57.460 --> 01:58.490
YOU WEREN'T THINKING,
WERE YOU?

01:58.560 --> 01:59.690
NO.

I'M NOT A SNIVELING TOAD,

OF COURSE NOT.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.830
THEN WHAT AM I?

02:06.910 --> 02:09.440
A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING.

02:09.509 --> 02:11.180
WHAT DO YOU LIKE BEST
ABOUT ME?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.140
WELL, I'D HAVE TO SAY...

02:13.210 --> 02:14.980
YOUR GENEROUS NATURE.

02:15.050 --> 02:16.850
YOUR SPIRIT OF GIVING.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.790
WELL, HMM...

02:18.850 --> 02:21.490
OPEN YOUR MOUTH
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES

02:42.540 --> 02:43.780
SO WHAT?

02:43.840 --> 02:45.370
SO GIVE HER BACK
THOSE CUPCAKES

08:52.180 --> 08:53.880
THE CODE
OF THE SCHOOLYARD.

LET'S SEE.
"DON'T TATTLE."

"ALWAYS MAKE FUN OF THOSE
DIFFERENT FROM YOU."

"NEVER SAY ANYTHING,
UNLESS YOU'RE SURE

EVERYONE FEELS EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY YOU DO."

09:06.220 --> 09:07.250
WHAT ELSE?

09:07.330 --> 09:08.700
OH, HOMER,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

09:08.760 --> 09:11.470
BART, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING,

09:11.530 --> 09:13.730
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING?

09:13.800 --> 09:15.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MOM?

09:15.370 --> 09:17.670
THIS OUGHT TO BE GOOD
FOR A LAUGH.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.810
SHH, THIS BULLY FRIEND
OF YOURS,

09:19.870 --> 09:21.710
IS HE A LITTLE
ON THE CHUNKY SIDE?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.570
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY CHUNKIFIED
ALL RIGHT.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.050
AND I'LL BET HE DOESN'T
DO WELL IN HIS STUDIES EITHER.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.220
NO, HE'S PRETTY DUMB.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.180
HE'S IN ALL THE SAME
SPECIAL CLASSES I AM.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.690
THAT'S WHY HE LASHES OUT
AT THE WORLD.

09:33.750 --> 09:34.960
SO TOMORROW

09:35.020 --> 09:37.460
INSTEAD OF BICKERING
WITH THIS BOY, TALK TO HIM.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.620
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED HOW FAR
A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING WILL GO.

09:39.690 --> 09:42.530
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MRS. MAHARISHI GANDHI.

09:42.590 --> 09:43.920
LET'S GO, BOY.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.330
( <i>growling )</i>

09:45.400 --> 09:47.740
NOW HERE'S THAT BULLY OF YOURS.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.000
SHOW ME YOUR STUFF.

09:49.070 --> 09:50.670
UHN... HUNH...

09:50.740 --> 09:52.270
UHH... HUHH.

09:52.340 --> 09:53.710
NO, NOT LIKE THAT.

09:53.770 --> 09:54.810
LIKE THIS.

09:54.870 --> 09:56.430
EEE-YAH!

09:56.510 --> 09:59.150
( <i>growling )</i>

10:03.180 --> 10:05.690
SEE THAT, BOY?
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT, DID YOU?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.360
AND NEITHER WILL HE.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.820
YOU MEAN I SHOULD FIGHT DIRTY?

10:09.890 --> 10:12.530
UNFORTUNATELY, SON,
WE SIMPSONS SOMETIMES

10:12.590 --> 10:14.960
HAVE TO BEND THE RULES
IN ORDER TO HOLD OUR OWN.

10:15.030 --> 10:18.600
SO THE NEXT TIME
THIS BULLY THINKS YOU'RE
GONNA THROW A PUNCH,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.890
YOU THROW A GLOB OF MUD
IN HIS EYES

10:20.970 --> 10:23.540
AND THEN YOU SOCK HIM WHEN HE'S
STAGGERING AROUND BLINDED.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.610
YEAH!

10:24.670 --> 10:25.940
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

10:26.000 --> 10:28.030
WITH HITTING SOMEONE
WHEN HIS BACK IS TURNED.

10:28.110 --> 10:29.080
GOTCHA.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.910
IF YOU GET THE CHANCE

10:30.980 --> 10:33.110
GET HIM IN
THE FAMILY JEWELS.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.880
THAT LITTLE DOOZY'S BEEN
A SIMPSON TRADEMARK
FOR GENERATIONS.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.090
BART, YOU CAN'T

11:11.150 --> 11:12.650
I KNOW.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.720
WHY DON'T YOU
GO SEE GRANDPA?

11:14.790 --> 11:15.920
WHAT CAN HE DO?

11:15.990 --> 11:17.460
HE'LL GIVE YOU GOOD ADVICE.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.950
HE'S THE TOUGHEST SIMPSON ALIVE.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.480
HE IS?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.460
REMEMBER THE FIGHT HE PUT UP
WHEN WE PUT HIM IN THE HOME?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.300
I'M HERE TO SEE GRANDPA.

ARE NAMED "GRANDPA."

11:39.140 --> 11:41.110
DEAR ADVERTISERS:

11:41.180 --> 11:44.390
I AM DISGUSTED
WITH THE WAY OLD PEOPLE

11:44.450 --> 11:46.420
ARE DEPICTED ON TELEVISION.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.510
WE ARE NOT ALL VIBRANT,
FUN-LOVING SEX MANIACS.

11:50.590 --> 11:54.060
MANY OF US ARE BITTER,
RESENTFUL INDIVIDUALS

11:54.130 --> 11:56.900
WHO REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS

11:56.960 --> 12:00.570
WHEN ENTERTAINMENT WAS BLAND
AND INOFFENSIVE.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.440
THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF WORDS

12:03.500 --> 12:06.740
I NEVER WANT TO HEAR

HI, GRANDPA.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.740
BART, WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.520
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.550
THERE'S THIS BULLY
AT SCHOOL

12:21.620 --> 12:23.490

12:23.560 --> 12:27.090
IF YOU DON'T STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF,

12:27.160 --> 12:30.200

FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.900

GIVE ME YOUR NEWSPAPER.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.420
WHY SHOULD I?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
I WANT TO DO

BUT CAN I INTEREST YOU

13:13.200 --> 13:15.070
IN SOME AUTHENTIC
NAZI UNDERPANTS?

13:15.140 --> 13:16.540
NO!

13:16.610 --> 13:20.110
WE CAME BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY GRANDSON, BART.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.850
HELLO, YOUNG AMERICAN.

13:21.910 --> 13:23.340
HELLO, SIR.

UH, MR. HERMAN?

13:24.950 --> 13:25.890
YES?

13:25.950 --> 13:27.760
DID YOU LOSE YOUR ARM

13:27.820 --> 13:29.320
IN THE WAR?

13:29.390 --> 13:31.190
MY ARM?
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.260
NEXT TIME YOUR TEACHER TELLS YOU

13:33.320 --> 13:36.890
TO KEEP YOUR ARM INSIDE
THE BUS WINDOW, YOU DO IT.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.470
YES, SIR.
I WILL.

13:38.530 --> 13:41.170
BART'S GOT A PROBLEM
WITH A LOCAL YOUNG
BULLY NAMED NELSON.

13:41.230 --> 13:44.600
I THOUGHT YOU COULD HELP HIM
WITH SOME KIND OF STRATEGY.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.110
STRATEGY?
HMM.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.040
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE?

13:48.110 --> 13:49.110
NONE.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.330
YOU'LL NEED MORE.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.980
AND YOU'LL NEED
TO TRAIN THEM-- HARD.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.770
NOW, LET'S SEE.

13:54.850 --> 13:56.350
OKAY.

13:56.410 --> 13:59.380
THE KEY TO SPRINGFIELD
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ELM STREET.

13:59.450 --> 14:02.190
THE GREEKS KNEW IT,
THE CARTHAGINIANS KNEW IT.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.810
NOW YOU KNOW IT.

14:03.890 --> 14:07.190
FIRST YOU'LL NEED
A DECLARATION OF WAR.

14:07.260 --> 14:11.200
THAT WAY EVERYTHING YOU DO
WILL BE NICE AND LEGAL.

14:11.260 --> 14:15.260
OKAY. I CAN USE THIS ONE
FROM THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.460
I'LL JUST CHANGE

14:25.280 --> 14:28.520
WELL, GENERAL GEORGE S. PATTON
WAS A LITTLE NUTS.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.880
AND THIS GUY

14:29.950 --> 14:31.850
IS COMPLETELY

14:31.920 --> 14:33.320
WE CAN'T FAIL!

AGAINST A TEN-YEAR-OLD.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.130
NELSON'S AT THE ARCADE,
GENERAL.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.130
BATTLE STATIONS!

18:17.190 --> 18:18.460
I FEEL SO ALIVE.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.630
YOU KNOW,

18:19.690 --> 18:21.760
I THOUGHT I WAS TOO OLD.

18:21.830 --> 18:24.300
I THOUGHT MY TIME HAD PASSED.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.200
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER HEAR

18:26.270 --> 18:27.840
THE SCREAMS OF PAIN

18:27.900 --> 18:30.830
OR SEE THE LOOK OF TERROR
IN A YOUNG MAN'S EYES.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.210
THANK HEAVEN FOR CHILDREN.

18:33.270 --> 18:34.900
HEY, GOOD SQUISHIES.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.380
WHAT FLAVOR DID YOU GET?

18:36.440 --> 18:37.570
BLUE.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.450
YOU'LL SUCK MEALS
THROUGH STRAWS

18:39.510 --> 18:41.240
IF YOU DON'T
SHUT YOUR TRAPS.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.060
WELL, LOOKEE HERE.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.820
LITTLE BART SIMPSON.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.460
NELSON, I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.460
OH, YEAH?

18:51.530 --> 18:52.730

18:52.790 --> 18:53.650

18:55.430 --> 18:57.270
ARTILLERY...

18:57.330 --> 18:59.640
COMMENCE SATURATION BOMBING!

18:59.700 --> 19:02.140

19:32.830 --> 19:35.360
GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE

19:35.440 --> 19:36.410
( <i>screaming )</i>

19:36.470 --> 19:37.810
NOOOOO!

19:37.870 --> 19:39.180
WAIT!

19:39.240 --> 19:40.240
DON'T HURT US!

19:40.310 --> 19:41.310
WE SURRENDER!

19:41.380 --> 19:43.610
WE WERE ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS!

19:44.780 --> 19:46.050
AUGGHH!

19:46.110 --> 19:47.240
OOH! OOH! AH!

19:49.850 --> 19:51.290

19:57.460 --> 19:59.200
( <i>laughing and jeering )</i>

19:59.260 --> 20:01.160
I GUESS YOU
LEARNED YOUR LESSON

20:01.230 --> 20:02.500
SO NOW I'LL UNTIE YOU.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.220
THE SECOND YOU UNTIE ME

20:04.300 --> 20:06.970
I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU
TO DEATH, MAN.

20:07.030 --> 20:10.060
IF THAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE,
I'M NOT GONNA UNTIE YOU.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.840
HA. YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO SOMETIME.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.410
UH-OH. HE'S RIGHT.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.120
DON'T YOU WORRY.

20:18.180 --> 20:21.050
I WAS READY FOR THIS
LITTLE EVENTUALITY.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.450
"ARMISTICE TREATY, ARTICLE FOUR:

20:23.520 --> 20:28.230
"NELSON IS NEVER AGAIN
TO RAISE HIS FISTS IN ANGER.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.630
"ARTICLE FIVE:

20:29.690 --> 20:32.100
"NELSON RECOGNIZES
BART'S RIGHT TO EXIST.

A FIGUREHEAD OF MENACE

20:38.000 --> 20:39.270
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD."

20:39.330 --> 20:40.630
WOW, SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.970
OKAY, I'LL SIGN.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.210
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BOY?

20:43.270 --> 20:44.610
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SIGN.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.130
ARE YOU BOYS THROUGH
PLAYING WAR?

20:46.210 --> 20:48.080

20:56.650 --> 20:59.660
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.130
CONTRARY TO WHAT
YOU'VE JUST SEEN,

21:02.190 --> 21:04.630
WAR IS NEITHER GLAMOROUS
NOR FUN.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.620
THERE ARE NO WINNERS,
ONLY LOSERS.

21:06.690 --> 21:10.590
THERE ARE NO GOOD WARS,
WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS:

21:10.670 --> 21:12.070
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION,

21:12.130 --> 21:14.590
WORLD WAR II
AND THE <i>STAR WARS TRILOGY.</i>

21:14.670 --> 21:15.910
IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT WAR,

21:15.970 --> 21:18.110
THERE'S LOTS OF BOOKS
IN YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY,

21:18.170 --> 21:19.930
MANY OF THEM WITH COOL,
GORY PICTURES.

21:20.010 --> 21:21.240
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

21:21.310 --> 21:22.410
PEACE, MAN.
