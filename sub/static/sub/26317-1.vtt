21:12.836 --> 21:13.924
[tires screeching]

21:13.968 --> 21:16.666
Help! Help! Help!

21:16.710 --> 21:17.798
Help!

21:17.841 --> 21:19.147
He's gonna kill that kid!

21:19.190 --> 21:20.496
Let's get a car. Get a car.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.193
It's okay.I'll call for air support.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.108
Tell me what happened.Uh, he was gonna shoot me,

21:24.152 --> 21:26.807
and the kid stabbed him,
and he saved my life.Stabbed him where?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.417
Stabbed him where? With what?I don't know. In the side.

21:28.461 --> 21:29.766
I don't know...

21:29.810 --> 21:31.812
Captain, I have an armed suspect

21:31.855 --> 21:33.509
with a child hostage
in a stolen vehicle.

21:33.553 --> 21:34.858
I need eyes in the sky ASAP.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.251
I'm not sure how long
this kid's got.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.390
[distant chatter]

21:47.175 --> 21:50.309
WOMAN:
Help! Help!

21:50.352 --> 21:51.484
[electrical buzzing]WOMAN:
Someone help her.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.572
WOMAN 2:
Please help me.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.492
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.624
[gasps]
TONY:
I'll radio Fire,

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
see if we can get
a ladder truck.There's no time.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.453
You got a better idea?

22:04.497 --> 22:06.150
[electrical buzzing]

22:06.194 --> 22:07.935
Please.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.463
STREET:
Hang on. I'm coming for you![whimpers]

22:14.507 --> 22:16.683
HICKS:
I need you to clear
the squad cars

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
from the motor pool to make room
for the incoming victims.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.383
And, Kevin, make sure there's
enough juice in the generator

22:21.427 --> 22:23.254
to get us through the day.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.387
JESSICA:
All of our resources are
overloaded right now.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.650
I-I'll see what I can do.
Everyone's spread thin.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.173
Kevin, find me an airship

22:29.217 --> 22:31.175
to assist a vehicle pursuit
in Highland Park.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.742
HONDO:
How bad is it out there?

22:32.786 --> 22:34.483
So far, we've got
three overpasses down

22:34.527 --> 22:35.876
and five collapsed structures,

22:35.919 --> 22:37.530
including
the Tinsley hotel downtown.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.880
Eight dead, dozens injured.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.360
Still pulling people out.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.884
I have a friend
staying at the Tinsley.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.364
Any IDs on the victims?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.930
No, not yet.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.497
You think they were still there
when the quake hit?

22:48.541 --> 22:49.933
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm not sure.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.545
I hope not.Got us a ride, boss.
Come on, let's go.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.983
Hondo, I got you a news chopper.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.811
They're willing to help.All right, roger that.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.030
Suspect is driving a red
vintage-model Buick Apollo.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.423
We're in pursuit.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.120
Chris, you and Beni help Tan

23:03.164 --> 23:05.993
get those kids out,
then go check on Deac.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.430
[tires screeching]

23:08.474 --> 23:10.867
[electrical hissing]Just hang tight.
My partner's gonna get you

23:10.911 --> 23:13.043
out of there.I'm coming for you.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.741
You just stay calm.
Let me do the work.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.264
What's your name?

23:16.307 --> 23:17.744
My name's Jan.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.310
Have you been rock climbing,
Jan?
No.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.703
I'm afraid of heights.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.313
Okay.

23:22.357 --> 23:26.013
Well, good news is, this
is nothing like that.

23:28.015 --> 23:31.845
All right, Jan, I'm gonna lower
myself down to come get you.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.717
Okay.You just got to hang tight,
and I'll pull us back up, okay?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.893
[loud rumbling]

23:36.937 --> 23:38.808
Aftershock!

23:44.292 --> 23:46.468
[spectators gasp]

23:46.512 --> 23:47.948
[grunts]
[panting]

23:47.991 --> 23:50.211
Ah.
TONY:
You guys all right in there?

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
A couple scratches.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
Nice work, Tarzan.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.259
[chuckles]

23:55.303 --> 23:56.478
Best first date
ever, right?

23:56.522 --> 23:57.871
[laughs]
Yeah.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.873
[grunts]

23:59.916 --> 24:01.918
[sniffs]

24:01.962 --> 24:03.790
Anybody copy?CHRIS:
Loud and clear.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.618
Beni and I are heading your way.We got to get

24:05.661 --> 24:06.923
these kids out now.

24:06.967 --> 24:07.924
Think there's a gas leak.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.317
Roger that.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.580
[yelling]You know, the two of us

24:11.624 --> 24:12.668
could move that thing,
no problem.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.757
Or we just wait
for another aftershock

24:14.801 --> 24:17.151
and hope that this whole
building doesn't explode.I will die trying.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.283
I need to get back to my boys.Yeah?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.937
[grunting]Wouldn't it be better to live

24:20.981 --> 24:22.548
so you can tell 'em how
you saved another man's life?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.898
Wouldn't that set
a better example?

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
[panting]

24:29.032 --> 24:30.991
I got three kids.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.646
I got a fourth on the way.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.607
I know how deep
that love runs for them,

24:38.651 --> 24:42.437
and I know how hard...
you want to get back to them.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.179
You know that they'd be
better off with you alive.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.137
[whimpers]

24:47.181 --> 24:49.183
[panting]

24:49.226 --> 24:51.228
Knowing that you...
you did the right thing?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.971
[whimpers]

24:55.015 --> 24:56.843
[yells]

24:56.886 --> 24:58.975
[breathing heavily]

24:59.019 --> 25:02.022
All I've done has been
for my kids.

25:02.065 --> 25:05.112
Everything I've done has been
for my boys.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.549
I don't doubt that...

25:07.593 --> 25:11.553
but if they were here
right now...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.600
if they were here to see you,

25:14.643 --> 25:16.645
what would they tell you to do?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.922
[panting]

25:44.499 --> 25:47.023
JESSICA:
SKY2 says
he's a half mile up, going

25:47.067 --> 25:49.112
south on Huntington Drive.He's headed to the 10.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.766
Probably figures with
the earthquake chaos,

25:50.810 --> 25:52.768
we won't have the manpower
to shut down the freeway.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.030
Yeah, well, he figures right.
If he makes it that far,

25:54.074 --> 25:55.379
we're gonna be
chasing this guy out of town.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.556
And if he has enough gas,
he'll outrun us.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.774
Hey, Luca, gun it down Eastern.
Try to get

25:58.818 --> 26:00.602
in front of him
and cut him off.
All over it.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.951
PILOT:
I see your team rerouting.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.213
Should be in position
to intercept

26:03.257 --> 26:04.519
before the freeway ramp.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.868
Roger that, SKY2.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.391
Scratch that.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.176
Suspect now turning west
on Valley Boulevard.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.873
Reroute. Drummond's now
westbound on Valley.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.571
Repeat, westbound.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.182
That takes him awayfrom
the freeway. Where the hell is

26:15.225 --> 26:17.140
this guy going?Ah, it's gonna be a bitch
catching up to him now.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.968
Sorry, Captain. We just had
a third hospital start diverting

26:19.012 --> 26:20.622
to us, and we're out of space
in the gym.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.058
Use the locker room.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.494
Kitchen if you need to.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.584
Commander, I got
a freeway collapse across town.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.411
Needs visual support
for rescue ops.

26:27.455 --> 26:28.804
Gonna have to abort.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.197
All right, roger that, SKY2.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.590
Looks like your suspect

26:31.633 --> 26:33.374
is turning south
on Mission Road.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.202
I'll give another 20
before I lose visual.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.899
Apologies, Commander.Sorry, Hondo.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.727
We just lost our eyes.HONDO:
Captain, we're gonna

26:38.771 --> 26:40.033
be on this guy in three minutes.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.904
Can you buys us some more time?Negative.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.166
They got pulled
for a rescue.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.038
Drummond's still heading
toward downtown.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.170
Now going south on Mission.It's gonna be
like trying

26:47.214 --> 26:48.911
to find a needle
in a haystack down there.

26:48.955 --> 26:52.001
[groaning]

26:52.045 --> 26:53.655
Hey, sorry.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.310
Gas smell's getting stronger.I'll bring the last one.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.355
[grunts]
Come on.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.488
[screaming]Hey...

27:00.531 --> 27:02.098
Hey, I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

27:02.142 --> 27:03.622
I promise. I just want
to help you out here.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.971
[screaming]

27:05.014 --> 27:07.016
TAN:
No, no, no.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.539
No, no. I got you.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.106
Come on. Shh, shh, shh.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.630
I got you.
I got you, all right?

27:11.673 --> 27:13.370
Okay. Let's go.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.285
Get these kids out
on the fire escape.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.201
[grunting]

27:19.333 --> 27:20.377
All right.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.168
[sighs]

27:30.561 --> 27:32.955
[sighs]
After you.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.610
Nice try.
[sighs]

27:39.745 --> 27:41.703
[panicked chatter nearby]

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
[explosion][grunts]

27:54.107 --> 27:56.544
[grunting]

27:56.587 --> 27:59.634
Now, now, get down. Down, down,
down, down, down. Get down.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.897
[grunts]Shouldn't have run.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.204
I heard the bang.
You all right?
Better now.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.684
Did you get the kids out?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.207
I'm working on it.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.512
Let's go, let's go.
All your friends are down here.

28:08.556 --> 28:09.513
Come on.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.863
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.212
Come on, buddy.
You can do this.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.343
DEACON:
All right, it's okay.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.606
It's okay.
We got him.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.521
Deacon! I thought
he was out of commission.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.262
Good thing he wasn't.
You smell gas?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.700
Yeah. I got
the rest of 'em down,

28:21.743 --> 28:23.484
but this one won't
let me touch him.CHRIS: Hey.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.355
Let's move this way. Come on.Move, move!

28:25.399 --> 28:27.227
Come on. Keep walking.TAN:
Come on, please.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.228
No.
We have to go now.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.012
No, no.It's okay. It's okay.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.624
Stanley.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.242
Let's go. [grunts]

28:53.906 --> 28:54.907
[Tan screams]

29:03.393 --> 29:05.526
[groans, panting]

29:05.569 --> 29:07.528
Speak French?

29:07.571 --> 29:10.096
You don't?

29:10.139 --> 29:12.359
So, that's all the kids?All but one.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.752
Drummond got away
with a hostage.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.112
All our intel tells us
this guy doesn't have anyone

29:26.155 --> 29:27.940
who wants to help him
here in L.A.

29:27.983 --> 29:30.464
Yeah, and with cops spread thin,
there's no better time to run.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.813
He should be heading out
of town, not into it.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.075
So what's his plan?

29:33.119 --> 29:34.947
It doesn't make
sense, man.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.079
That quake hits
two minutes later, we would have

29:37.123 --> 29:38.646
had him back at that raid.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.300
Yeah, he's probably
the only guy in L.A.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.084
the shaking actually helped.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.783
Look, I hope your friend made
it out of that hotel okay.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.828
Yeah. Yeah, so do I.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.309
I can't think
about that right now.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.007
Wait a minute.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.531
Wait a minute, Luca,
what if Drummond's not okay?

29:54.575 --> 29:55.837
The witness said

29:55.881 --> 29:57.447
the kid shanked
him pretty good.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.667
What if he needs to get
patched up before he can run?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.451
And with all the injuries,

30:01.495 --> 30:03.671
an ER downtown won't think
twice about how he got stuck.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.282
Hey, Captain! Captain,
track Drummond's route

30:06.326 --> 30:08.110
from the carjacking
to where we lost him.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.982
See if any of it points
to hospitals or ERs.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.200
JESSICA:
Looking now.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.507
SKY2 had Drummond
heading south on Hill

30:13.550 --> 30:14.813
just before they
lost visual.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.988
JESSICA:
Which leads him

30:16.031 --> 30:18.120
through downtown... to here.Mm-hmm.

30:18.164 --> 30:21.558
If he stays on Hill,
it would take him

30:21.602 --> 30:23.125
right by Kinney Memorial.Roger that.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.171
Show us en route.
Go, go, go.
Go.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.476
I'm sorry, Captain.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.522
I know you're incredibly busy.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.480
I'm just wondering
if you've heard anything.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
I have, actually.
Good news.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.963
I spoke with campus
police personally, and

30:35.007 --> 30:36.486
they assured me they only had
a few minor injuries.
