A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.052
(engine whining )

01:51.060 --> 01:53.028
( female )
PIECE OF SHIT'S WHACKED.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.624
( male )
TRY THE CELL AGAIN.

01:55.630 --> 01:58.827
AND IT AIN'T
NO PIECE OF SHIT.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.651
THE ALTERNATOR'S
A LITTLE TEMPERAMENTAL.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.719
WELL, MAYBE
THE BATI'ERY'S DEAD.

02:03.730 --> 02:05.459
LIKE THIS PHONE.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.020
LOOK, IT AIN'T THE BATTERY,
IT'S TH E--

02:14.430 --> 02:16.955
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THEM
"SCREAM" MOVIES, HUH ?

02:16.960 --> 02:20.327
MORE LIKE
"BOYZ IN THE HOOD".

02:21.860 --> 02:23.418
LOOK, I'M GONNA JET
TO THAT PAY PHONE.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.193
ONE OF MY DOGS'LL
HOOK US UP.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.553
I KNOW YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME
HERE ALL ALONE.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.255
LOOK, YOU'LL BE
SAFER IN HERE.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.558
BE BACK IN THREE,
ALRIGHT ?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.096
ALRIGHT.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.728
GIVE ME
SOME LOVE.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.459
( phone ringing )

03:01.460 --> 03:03.690
( male )
Ain't nobody home,
leave a message.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.624
LOUIS, PICK UP
THE PHONE, DOG.

03:06.630 --> 03:09.599
WAKE UP, MAN.

03:14.730 --> 03:15.890
DAMN.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.721
LAZY ASS PUNK
MOTHERFUCKER MAN.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.252
PACO !

03:24.260 --> 03:25.659
OH, MY GOD !

03:28.430 --> 03:30.853
Who the fuck
is it ?

03:30.860 --> 03:32.919
Hello ?

03:32.930 --> 03:35.728
Hello ?

03:35.730 --> 03:37.357
Hello !

03:41.700 --> 03:43.952
WHERE YOU FROM ?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.789
YOUR MAMA'S
PUSSY, BITCH.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.199
PACO !

03:48.200 --> 03:49.292
PACO !

03:49.300 --> 03:51.256
( screaming )

03:51.830 --> 03:54.958
NO, NO, NO !

04:11.830 --> 04:16.028
HER ACCOUNT OF YOUR ACTIVITIES

04:16.030 --> 04:17.952
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.599
CRIME SCENE, SO, YOU'RE SAYING
IT WAS DEFINITELY ARSON ?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.022
WHAT'S YOUR STORY,
MR. FISHER ?

04:25.300 --> 04:27.222
THE HOUSE IS
EMPTY.

04:27.230 --> 04:29.494
I WANTED TO SHOW BRENDA
WHERE I USED TO HANG OUT

04:29.500 --> 04:30.558
WHEN I WAS A KID.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.448
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE
WANTED TO SHOW IT TO ME.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.792
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU
DID WHILE YOU WERE THERE ?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.756
WALKED AROUND,
LOOKED AT THINGS.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.548
YOU REALLY EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE YOU BROKE INTO

04:40.560 --> 04:42.448
AN ABANDONED HOUSE...

04:42.460 --> 04:44.155
JUST TO WALK AROUND ?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.449
OKAY.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.291
WE FUCKED.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.120
YOU SAID YOU WERE THERE
FOR AN HOUR OR SO ?

04:52.130 --> 04:53.256
TOPS.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.488
COULD YOU
WALK US THROUGH

04:54.500 --> 04:57.060
WHAT THE TWO OF YOU DID
FOR THAT HOUR ?

04:57.060 --> 04:58.493
WE...

04:58.500 --> 05:00.855
WE MADE LOVE.

05:00.860 --> 05:04.159
COULD YOU PLEASE BE
AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE ?

05:04.160 --> 05:08.256
JUST TO ESTABLISH
A TIMELINE.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.091
WELL...

05:10.100 --> 05:13.649
HE WENT DOWN ON ME
FOR AWHILE.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.788
HE'S REALLY
GOOD AT IT.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.598
I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER
THE SPECIFICS.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.390
HE WAS IN A STATE LIKE HE HAD
A LOT OF AGGRESSION TO WORK OUT.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.992
SHE SAID THAT
I WAS AGGRESSIVE ?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.753
MAN, SHE SHOULD TALK.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.250
THEN HE FELL ASLEEP.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.693
WHAT HAPPENED THEN ?

05:31.700 --> 05:33.895
WE WERE EXHAUSTED,
SO, WE LEFI'.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.652
I LEFI' TO
MEET SOMEBODY.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.127
HE WAS JUST
WAKING UP,

05:37.130 --> 05:38.791
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE DID AFI'ER THAT.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.449
CANIGO?

05:40.460 --> 05:42.928
I THINK WE HAVE
EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED.

05:42.930 --> 05:45.728
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR COOPERATION.

05:45.730 --> 05:48.051
PEACE OUT, GUYS.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.699
WELL, YEAH, SHE LEFI' FIRST,
I LEFT RIGHT AFTER THAT.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.349
ARE YOU AWARE THAT
THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION

05:52.360 --> 05:56.490
WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED BY
KROEHNER SERVICE INTERNATIONAL ?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.253
YES, MA'I'I' GILARDI SAID
THEY WERE PLANNING TO OPEN

05:59.260 --> 06:00.488
A CHEAP CREMATION PLACE

06:00.500 --> 06:01.990
AND PUT US
OUT OF BUSINESS.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.252
WAS THAT THE POINT
WHERE YOU CALLED HIM

06:04.260 --> 06:05.955
A "GREEDY NAZI FUCK" ?

06:05.960 --> 06:08.690
IS THAT CORRECT ?

06:08.700 --> 06:11.191
YES, THAT IS
CORRECT.

06:14.530 --> 06:16.896
YOU THINK I SET
THE FIRE ?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.720
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT...

06:18.730 --> 06:21.119
IT DOES SEEM LIKE
A BENEFICIAL TURN OF EVENTS

06:21.130 --> 06:22.620
FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

06:22.630 --> 06:23.949
SO, WHAT, DO I
NEED A LAWYER ?

06:23.960 --> 06:24.949
NOT YET.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.825
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

06:29.730 --> 06:31.493
ACTUALLY,
ONE MORE THING--

06:31.500 --> 06:34.628
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR SISTER
WAS ON THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE ?

06:34.630 --> 06:36.325
NO, WHY ?

06:36.330 --> 06:40.027
I UNDERSTAND SHE HAD
A RUN-IN WITH THE LAW RECENTLY.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.794
A MISSING FOOT.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.519
IF SHE IS DEVELOPING
A PATI'ERN OF ACTING OUT

06:45.530 --> 06:47.623
SUBSEQUENT TO
HER FATHER'S DEATH--

06:47.630 --> 06:49.655
CLAIRE HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH THAT FIRE.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.218
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?

06:54.500 --> 06:56.320
I KNEW PASSING THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT INSPECTION

06:56.330 --> 06:57.797
WAS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.825
IT JUST MEANT SOMETHING
ELSE WOULD GO WRONG.

06:59.830 --> 07:02.025
( pipe's banging )

07:02.030 --> 07:04.055
GREAT, THERE GOES
A MONTH'S PROFIT.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.051
WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT
AIR CONDITIONING,

07:06.060 --> 07:07.493
PLENTY OF
PEOPLE DO.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.889
YEAH, PEOPLE IN
THE THIRD WORLD.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.198
WE CAN'T RUN A BUSINESS
WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.997
IF WE LOSE
ANYMORE FUNERALS,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.729
KROEHNER WON'T HAVE
TO TAKE US OVER,

07:15.730 --> 07:17.254
WE'LL BE BAN KRUPT.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.825
HOW MUCH ?

07:20.830 --> 07:23.458
CENTRAL AIR,
THREE GRAND EASY.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.893
( Nate )
GUESS WHAT ?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.390
GILARDI TIPPED
THE COPS OFF.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.289
THINK I'M A SUSPECT.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.653
THAT'S RIDICU LOUS.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.651
WHERE'S CLAIRE ?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.150
SCHOOL...

07:34.160 --> 07:35.593
I HOPE.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.591
DO EITHER ONE OF YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS BEFORE THE FIRE ?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.692
WHY, WHAT IS IT--

07:38.700 --> 07:40.349
OH, DEAR GOD,
THEY DON'T THINK--

07:40.360 --> 07:42.658
OH, SHE COULDN'T HAVE.

07:42.660 --> 07:46.357
GOOD NEWS,
BAD NEWS.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.657
THE COMPRESSOR'S FINE.

07:47.660 --> 07:50.458
BAD NEWS IS YOUR PNEUMATIC
ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY IS SHOT.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.894
NORMALLY, I COULD
DO IT IN A DAY,

07:52.900 --> 07:55.027
BUT WITH THIS HEATWAVE,
BE'I'I'ER GIVE ME FIVE DAYS.

07:55.030 --> 07:55.849
FIVE ?

07:55.860 --> 07:57.088
WHAT'S IT GONNA
SET US BACK ?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.591
SHOULDN'T DEBT YOU MORE
THAN $3700, PARTS AND LABOR.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.852
( doorbell )

08:01.860 --> 08:03.396
OUR 10 O'CLOCK.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.388
TELL THEM I'LL HAVE
AIR CONDITIONING.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.051
TH REE DAYS.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.299
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
21 NEXT WEEK.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.929
WE WERE GONNA
BUY HIM A NEW BED.

08:22.930 --> 08:26.593
NOW, WE'RE BUYING
HIM A COFFIN.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.251
THREE IN
THE MORNING.

08:29.260 --> 08:32.195
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OUT WITH
THAT GIRL IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.953
IT'S THE WORSE THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN...

08:34.960 --> 08:37.793
TO LOSE A CHILD.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.449
WE LOST HIM
YEARS AGO.

08:42.930 --> 08:44.591
WE'LL SEE TO IT
THAT PACO--

08:44.600 --> 08:46.750
HIS NAME IS MANNY.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.354
HIS...

08:49.360 --> 08:52.488
HIS GANG NAME
WAS PACO.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.798
HE GOES BY PACO.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.291
AND HE WASN'T LOST,
HE WAS ASSASSINATED.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.420
WE'LL SEE TO IT THAT
HE HAS A DIGNIFIED SERVICE.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.227
WE'VE BEEN TO
THREE FUNERAL HOMES,

09:05.230 --> 09:06.891
NO ONE WILL TAKE US.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.754
WE DON'T TURN
PEOPLE AWAY HERE.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.628
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN FAMILIES
LACK THE FUNDS NECESSARY

09:12.630 --> 09:13.995
OR INSURANCE--

09:14.000 --> 09:15.058
I GOT MONEY.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.254
WE DON'T WANT
YOUR MONEY.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.956
MR. BOLIN, IF YOUR SON
IS WILLING TO FINANCE--

09:18.960 --> 09:20.598
HE'S NOT OUR SON !

09:20.600 --> 09:22.022
HE'S A GANG LEADER.

09:22.030 --> 09:24.248
ALVARADO KINGS.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.989
DON'T YOU
READ THE PAPERS ?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.729
MY NAME IS
POWERFUL.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.619
PACO'S GONNA HAVE A FAT ASS
FUNERAL WHATEVER IT COSTS.

09:34.630 --> 09:37.690
WE'VE GOT MAD CASH,

09:37.700 --> 09:39.998
SO LONG AS Y'ALL
CAN DO IT UPRIGHT.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.595
NOW, CAN Y'ALL DO IT UPRIGHT
OR SHALL WE MOVE ON ?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.993
IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.150
NATE WILL SHOW YOU
SOME FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS

09:52.160 --> 09:53.798
WHICH MIGHT BE
TO YOUR LIKING.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.394
UMM.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.925
LILIES ARE
ALWAYS NICE.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.948
( radio playing )

10:10.830 --> 10:13.025
FEDERICO, I NEED
YOUR HELP.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.793
YOUR EXPERTISE.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.495
I'VE GOT A REALLY
TOUGH ONE UPSTAIRS.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.422
DECOMP ?
CRISPY CRI'I'I'ER ?

10:18.430 --> 10:21.058
GUNSHOTS,
NO FACIAL DAMAGE,
CUT AND DRIED.

10:21.060 --> 10:24.427
THE FAMILY WANTS
A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN FUNERAL.

10:24.430 --> 10:27.695
OKAY, WHAT'S A TRADITIONAL
MEXICAN FUNERAL ?

10:27.700 --> 10:30.191
BUT, THERE'S
THIS OTHER GUY,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.225
THE DECEASED'S
GANG LEADER.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.024
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ME ?

10:39.030 --> 10:41.248
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD
TALK TO THEM FOR ME.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.488
WITH ME.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.899
WHAT ?

10:43.900 --> 10:45.788
BECAUSE I'M LATINO,
I KNOW ABOUT GANGS.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.859
YOU PROBABLY KNOW
MORE THAN I DO.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.191
WHY IS THAT ?

10:49.200 --> 10:52.249
WELL, I JUST ASSUMED
THAT MAYBE,

10:52.260 --> 10:54.694
SOMEBODY IN
YOUR FAMILY MIGHT--

10:54.700 --> 10:56.918
NO, NO ONE IN
MY FAMILY NEVER.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.659
I'VE WORKED HERE
FOR YEARS

10:58.660 --> 11:00.298
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
A DAMN THING ABOUT ME.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.154
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.422
YOU OWN A ATLAS ?

11:03.430 --> 11:04.590
AN ATLAS ?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.897
YEAH, BECAUSE
IF YOU DID,

11:05.900 --> 11:07.652
YOU'D KNOW THERE'S
A 2,400 MILE DIFFERENCE

11:07.660 --> 11:09.594
BETWEEN PUERTO RICO
AND MEXICO.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.227
YOU'RE PUERTO RICAN ?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.821
( Spanish )

11:15.830 --> 11:19.027
LOOK, FEDERICO,
I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMED.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.694
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE THIS FUNERAL.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.656
AND I'M AFRAID
IF NATE AND I

11:32.660 --> 11:35.049
ARE THE POINT
OF CONTACT, WE WILL.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.028
( Federico )
THIS IS OUR BLUE OPAL,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.453
20 GAUGE ALUMINUM
AND COPPER

11:39.460 --> 11:42.293
WITH A LIGHT BLUE
SOVEREIGN VELVET INTERIOR.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.326
IT'S NICER
THAN OUR CAR.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.627
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.120
IT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.894
MRS. BOLIN,

11:54.900 --> 11:57.460
IF THIS IS THE CASKET THAT
YOU WANT FOR YOUR SON,

11:57.460 --> 11:59.325
THEN YOU SHOULD
HAVE IT.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.457
HE IS YOUR SON.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.553
HEY.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.949
WHERE YOU FROM, DOG ?

12:13.460 --> 12:15.394
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.227
WHERE YOU FROM ?

12:27.230 --> 12:29.858
LIKE WHERE MY PARENTS
WERE BORN ?

12:29.860 --> 12:32.351
PUERTO RICO.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.954
WHERE YOU FROM ?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.791
AS WHAT GANG
I BELONG TO ?

12:36.800 --> 12:38.950
YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
GANG I BELONG TO.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.020
THE GANG IS GONNA HELP YOU
BURY YOUR FRIEND.

12:42.030 --> 12:45.329
THE GANG IS GONNA BE THERE
FOR YOU AND YOUR CHOLOS

12:45.330 --> 12:47.321
WHEN EVERY OTHER FUCKIN'
HOME DOESN'T WANNA DEAL

12:47.330 --> 12:49.457
WITH YOUR
TIRED-ASS BU LLSHIT.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.327
YOUR FRIEND
IS DEAD, MAN.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.925
DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
OR YOU WANNA GO HEADS-UP ?

13:08.800 --> 13:10.256
IT'S GOOD.

13:11.930 --> 13:13.750
I DON'T LIKE IT,
IT'S DANGEROUS.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.819
NOT IF WE LET RICO
HANDLE EVERYTHING.

13:15.830 --> 13:19.095
DAVID, WE ARE
SO WHITE.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.091
IF WE STEP IN,
WE WILL TOTALLY FUCK UP.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.249
LANGUAGE.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.125
FRANKLY, I'M MORE
WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER

13:24.130 --> 13:25.495
CLAIRE STARTED
THAT FIRE.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.889
WHY WOULD SHE ?
TO HELP US OUT,
SHE HATES US.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.458
IS BRENDA
A VEGETARIAN ?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.052
SHE'LL EAT ANYTHING.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.127
DO YOU KNOW
THE NIGHT DAD DIED,

13:38.130 --> 13:39.825
CLAIRE WAS HIGH
ON CRYSTAL METH ?

13:39.830 --> 13:42.958
OH, MY GOD, ISN'T THAT
A HORSE TRANQUILIZER ?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.451
NO, IT'S SPEED,
REALLY NASTY SPEED

13:45.460 --> 13:46.927
THAT MAKES YOU CRAZY.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.295
IF THERE ARE THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HEAR,

13:48.300 --> 13:50.996
GO TALK ABOUT THEM
IN ANOTHER ROOM.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.594
I ASSUME SHE DRINKS.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.353
YOU KNOW, I CAN CALL
AND TELL HER TO CANCEL.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.248
NO, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.955
( David )
I HAVE SOME
ERRANDS TO RUN.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.326
I'LL PICK UP A NICE
CHARDONNAY WHILE I'M OUT.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.252
WHAT ERRANDS ?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.649
I CAN GIVE YOU A LIST
IF YOU'D LIKE.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.696
YOU GUYS...

14:08.700 --> 14:11.897
THIS KID AT SCHOOL TODAY GOT
BUSTED FOR HAVING A TASER,

14:11.900 --> 14:14.050
'CAUSE HE SHOWED IT TO
HIS FRIENDS AT LUNCH.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.051
WHAT AN IDIOT,
THERE WERE LIKE SIX COPS.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.221
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
HILARIOUS.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.149
WHAT ?

14:24.030 --> 14:27.249
NO, IT'S NOT REALLY
A GANG FUNERAL, IT'S...

14:27.260 --> 14:30.696
THEY NEEDED A HOME,
WE NEEDED A BODY.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.894
EVERYONE WINS.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.322
YEAH, RIGHT.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.729
WHO YOU GONNA CALL WHEN
THE BULLETS START FLYING ?

14:34.730 --> 14:35.799
ANYONE BUT YOU.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.256
OH, YOU'RE
DAMN STRAIGHT.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.629
CLAIRE'S GONNA
NEED A LAWYER.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.790
A GOOD ONE.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.098
LOOK, IF SHE SET THAT FIRE
SHE'LL DO WHAT'S RIGHT,

14:45.100 --> 14:46.419
I'LL SEE TO IT.

14:46.430 --> 14:48.557
WHAT'S RIGHT IS GETTING
HER SOME TOP-SHELF
LEGAL COUNSEL

14:48.560 --> 14:49.959
AND HAVING HER
PLEAD THE FIFTH.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.621
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO,

14:51.630 --> 14:53.393
JUST KEEP HER
OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.549
SH E'LL BE
EATEN ALIVE.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.289
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU CAN SNOOP AROUND

14:56.300 --> 14:57.824
AND FIND OUT WHAT
THEIR GAME PLAN IS ?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.196
I DON'T KNOW, I ALREADY
INTERFERED ONCE.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.350
ARE YOU GUYS
PULLING OUT OR WHAT ?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.554
YEAH, IN A MINUTE.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.255
WELL,
LET'S GO.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.695
FUCKING FAGS, MAN.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.720
KEITH...

15:24.500 --> 15:25.819
KEITH !

15:27.130 --> 15:28.154
SAY IT AGAIN.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.149
WHAT ?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.457
SAY IT AGAIN.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.325
NEXT TIME YOU CALL
SOMEONE A FUCKING FAG,

15:32.330 --> 15:34.821
YOU MAKE SURE THAT FAG
ISN'T A LAPD OFFICER.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.354
YOU GOT THAT ?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.920
YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

15:38.930 --> 15:40.591
YEAH.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.696
NOW, YOU GOT MY BADGE,
FILE A COMPLAINT,
I DARE YOU.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.555
YOU GET YOUR PUNK ASS
OUT OF HERE.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.699
FUCKING BITCH.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.756
TORE HIS ASS UP.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.591
I DON'T THINK HE MEANT
ANYTHING BY IT.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.626
DO YOU HATE
YOURSELF
THAT MUCH ?

16:20.660 --> 16:22.355
THIS IS SOME
FUCKED UP WAY

16:22.360 --> 16:24.123
TO MAKE A LIVING,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

16:32.630 --> 16:34.427
SO, HOW'S YOUR
DAY, MAN ?

16:34.430 --> 16:37.149
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.219
YOU EVER SEE
SUNLIGHT ?

16:39.230 --> 16:40.993
YOU GOTTA
AVOID IT.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.897
HEY, YOU
CHECKING OUT
MY DICK.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.527
I WAS NOT.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.225
( laughing )

16:50.230 --> 16:53.358
I'M JUST FUCKING
WITH YOU, MAN.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.222
UHH, HI.

16:58.230 --> 17:01.324
( French )

17:01.330 --> 17:03.195
A GIFT FROM
MY PARENTS.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.226
THEY'LL FREAK WHEN
THEY FIND OUT.

17:06.230 --> 17:08.551
YOU'RE AN
HOUR EARLY.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.221
REALLY ?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.993
YEAH.

17:16.730 --> 17:21.155
NOT QUITE AS
"ADDAMS FAMILY"
AS I'D EXPECTED.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.357
DAVE AND I USED TO PLAY
ADDAMS FAMILY WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.851
I WAS USUALLY GOMEZ,
HE WAS ALWAYS LURCH.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.895
THE KITSCH FACTOR
IS SUBSTANTIAL.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.755
HENCE YOUR WELL DEVELOPED
SENSE OF IRONY I SUPPOSE.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.297
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.222
( Ruth )
DO I HEAR VOICES ?

17:39.230 --> 17:40.788
LOOK WHO'S EARLY.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.052
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE
YOU AGAIN, MRS. FISHER.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.699
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT, DEAR.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.089
CHAMPAGNE.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.227
HOW FESTIVE,
THANK YOU.

17:50.230 --> 17:54.257
EXCUSE ME, I'M KNEE DEEP
IN MARINARA.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.524
I'LL GO CHILL THIS.

17:56.530 --> 17:59.624
NATE, GIVE
BRENDA A TOUR.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.590
SHE HATES ME.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.158
WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT ?

18:06.160 --> 18:07.491
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.652
UH...

18:10.660 --> 18:12.196
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.156
AFRAID MOMMY
MIGHT SEE ?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.993
OKAY, CAN WE NOT TURN
TONIGHT INTO PSYCH 101 ?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.558
BECAUSE TRUST ME,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.221
WE'D NEVER MAKE IT
THROUGH THE EVENING.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.653
SOMEBODY'S
DEFENSIVE.

18:22.660 --> 18:25.356
NATE, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
YOUR MOTHER LIKES ME OR NOT,

18:25.360 --> 18:27.089
I DON'T CARE.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.228
WHAT'S THAT SHIT ?

18:34.230 --> 18:36.289
OH, HELL NO.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.256
NO.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.598
HOW COME YOU DON'T
CALL YOUR BONE DADDY ?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.751
STILL PISSED
AT HIM, RIGHT ?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.421
I'M FEELING YOU, MAN.

18:48.430 --> 18:50.796
WHAT GIVES HIM THE RIGHT
TO GET UP IN YOUR WORLD ?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.028
YOU DON'T BE
SO FUCKING--

18:52.030 --> 18:53.895
SO FUCKING
SELF RIGHTEOUS ?

18:53.900 --> 18:57.028
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING.

18:57.030 --> 18:59.590
YOU DON'T CALL
HIM NOTHING.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.955
BUT HE WENT
OFF ON YOU.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.952
I THINK HE'S GOT A PROBLEM WITH
THAT STRESS MANAGEMENT SHIT.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.724
MAYBE HE'S ONE OF
THEM RAGE-AHOLICS.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.324
THAT BOY WENT OFF.

19:10.330 --> 19:12.457
I KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
SOME KID CALLS HIM A FAG.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.052
IT'S SO UNNECESSARY.

19:14.060 --> 19:16.824
WELL, HE CALLED YOU
A FAG TOO.

19:16.830 --> 19:18.297
SO?

19:18.300 --> 19:19.995
SO, WHAT'D YOU DO ?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.353
NOTHING.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.021
UH-HUH.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.794
AND SIMON PETER STOOD
AND WARMED HIMSELF.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.553
THEY SAID
THEREFORE UNTO HIM,

19:31.560 --> 19:34.859
ART NOT THOU
ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES ?

19:34.860 --> 19:36.919
HE DENIED IT,

19:36.930 --> 19:39.398
AND SAID,
I AM NOT.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.550
JOHN 1825.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.619
NO WONDER HE WENT OFF
ON YOU, MAN.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.427
YOU KNOW ?

19:48.730 --> 19:50.254
HEY.

19:50.260 --> 19:53.127
BURY ME NAKED,
PLEASE.

19:53.130 --> 19:55.018
( Brenda )
IT'S A SHAME
DIANE ARMUS IS DEAD.

19:55.030 --> 19:58.090
SHE COULD TAKE SOME FUCKING
GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS IN HERE.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.756
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TODAY ?

20:04.760 --> 20:08.298
NOTHING, I JUST HAVE
A LOT ON MY MIND.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.359
I DON'T WANT TO
BORE YOU WITH IT.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.657
THANK YOU.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.659
COME HERE.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.351
WHY ?

20:22.360 --> 20:24.590
JUST DO IT.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.356
WHAT'S WRONG ?

20:33.360 --> 20:36.454
WELL, LET'S SEE, I'M ABOUT
TO BECOME AN UNDERTAKER

20:36.460 --> 20:39.054
AND I'M SCARED
TO DEATH OF IT.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.392
A HUGE CORPORATION WANTS
TO PUT US OUT OF BUSINESS

20:41.400 --> 20:43.425
AND I'M WORRIED MY SISTER'S
NOT ONLY A CRACKHEAD,

20:43.430 --> 20:45.523
SHE'S AN ARSONIST.

20:45.530 --> 20:49.193
THERE'S A LOT OF SADNESS
IN THIS HOUSE.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.452
IT'S A FUNERAL HOME.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.327
NO WONDER
YOU RAN AWAY.

20:54.330 --> 20:57.652
CHANNEL OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN
YOU KNOW THAT, NATE ?

20:57.660 --> 21:00.891
MY FATHER CALLED
IT A GIFT.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.990
IT IS A GIFT.

21:26.260 --> 21:27.818
( noise ??)

21:41.500 --> 21:42.956
OHH !

21:45.160 --> 21:46.821
OH, GOD !

21:47.900 --> 21:50.391
OH, GOD !

21:51.960 --> 21:53.518
GUESS DINNER'S READY.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.423
SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO BE INTERROGATED ?

21:57.430 --> 21:58.852
DID YOU FLASH
YOUR CROTCH

21:58.860 --> 22:00.521
LIKE SHARON STONE
IN THAT MOVIE ?

22:00.530 --> 22:01.758
CLAIRE.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.557
( Brenda )
THEY JUST KEEP ASKING
THE SAME QUESTION

22:03.560 --> 22:04.891
DIFFERENT WAYS
TO TRIP YOU UP.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.959
THAT'S COOL.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.689
WAS IT FUN, I BET
IT WAS KIND OF FUN ?

22:08.700 --> 22:10.190
NOT REALLY.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.327
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA
WANT TO INTERROGATE ME ?

22:12.330 --> 22:13.752
NO.

22:16.430 --> 22:18.318
NATE.

22:18.330 --> 22:19.991
WILL YOU SAY GRACE ?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.629
WOULDN'T
DAVID RATHER ?

22:23.630 --> 22:25.359
PLEASE.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.420
THANK YOU, OH, LORD,
FOR OUR HEALTH AND BOUNTY

22:28.430 --> 22:30.694
THROUGH CHRIST,
OUR LORD, AMEN.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.019
WHAT, ARE YOU
ON CRACK ?!

22:33.560 --> 22:34.788
SQUASH ?

22:37.000 --> 22:40.094
MOM, NATE AND I HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON A BUSINESS PLAN

22:40.100 --> 22:42.318
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE
GONNA FEND OFF KROEHNER.

22:42.330 --> 22:43.627
BUSINESS PLAN.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.951
YOUR FATHER NEVER
HAD A BUSINESS PLAN.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.418
( Nate )
WELL, THAT'S PART
OF THE PROBLEM.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.296
I DON'T NEED
TO SEE IT.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.689
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS,
NOT MINE.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.952
IS THERE SAUCE
FOR THE PASTA ?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.097
I'LL GET IT.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.588
( David )
BRENDA, WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR A LIVING ?

23:04.600 --> 23:05.851
( Ruth )
SHE GIVES MASSAGES.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.350
( Brenda )
SHIATSU.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.998
WHAT EXACTLY
IS THAT ?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.150
IT'S A JAPAN ESE
BODY WORK TECHNIQUE

23:11.160 --> 23:13.492
THAT INVOLVES
PRESSURE TO POINTS

23:13.500 --> 23:15.752
ON ACUPUNCTURE
MERIDIANS.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.059
WELL, HOW INTERESTING,
ACUPUNCTURE.

23:19.060 --> 23:21.358
THAT'S THE PINS,
RIGHT ?

23:21.360 --> 23:22.759
YES.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.489
THE PINS.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.196
SO, YOU STICK PINS
IN PEOPLE.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.294
I USE MY THUMBS,
WRISTS, ELBOWS.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.449
SO, YOU STICK YOUR
THUMBS IN PEOPLE ?

23:34.460 --> 23:36.758
NO.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.591
AT LEAST NOT AS
PART OF MY JOB.

23:46.230 --> 23:48.790
I HOPE YOU STAY
FOR DESSERT.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.256
IT'S PEACH COBBLER.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.895
YUM.

24:01.660 --> 24:04.197
THIS IS A NICE BOX.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.623
THAT FEDERICO IS
A GOOD SALESMAN, HUH ?

24:06.630 --> 24:09.155
I'LL SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MARK UP IS ON ONE OF THESE ?

24:09.160 --> 24:10.229
$3200.

24:12.630 --> 24:14.951
HEY, CAN I GET LIKE
A NIGHTLIGHT UP IN HERE ?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.894
I DON'T LIKE
THE DARK.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.322
WELL, THEN, YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE

24:18.330 --> 24:20.457
AND GOTTEN
YOURSELF SHOT.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.293
SHIT, THAT'S COLD, MAN.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.188
MR. POWERFUL AND
HIS ENTOURAGE ARE HERE.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.997
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.355
WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO ?

24:34.360 --> 24:36.191
MYSELF.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.749
DAVID, WHY DID YOU STOP
GOING TO CHURCH WITH ME ?

24:46.230 --> 24:47.993
I'VE BEEN GOING TO
A DIFFERENT CHURCH

24:48.000 --> 24:49.729
WITH A FRIEND
OF MINE.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.152
THAT COP ?

24:51.160 --> 24:52.821
THE BLACK MAN ?

24:52.830 --> 24:55.048
DON'T BE
A PUSSY.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.192
YES, MOM, THAT COP,
THE BLACK MAN.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.489
( chattering and music )

25:36.330 --> 25:38.992
I LOVE YOU, PACO.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.627
OH, GOD.

26:01.030 --> 26:03.055
YOU ALRIGHT ?

26:03.060 --> 26:06.598
I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING
BIBLE SALESMAN.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.251
I LOOK LIKE YOU.

26:09.260 --> 26:12.821
WHAT'S WITH THIS
WHACK ASS MUSIC ?

26:18.130 --> 26:20.428
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THE MUSIC.

26:20.430 --> 26:23.854
YEAH, IT BLOWS.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.021
WHAT ABOUT
THE AVA MARIA ?

26:26.030 --> 26:28.123
PERFECT.
PERFECT.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.852
( change in music )

27:01.730 --> 27:03.357
HONEY... ?

27:09.100 --> 27:11.728
NO, NO, NO.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.228
(crying )

27:26.800 --> 27:29.951
IT'S LIKE A MAD
SCIENTIST LAB IN HERE.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.655
HOW CAN YOU
LIVE HERE ?

27:31.660 --> 27:33.548
BETTER THAN
A TURKISH PRISON...

27:33.560 --> 27:34.822
MOST DAYS.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.654
JESUS.

27:44.660 --> 27:47.151
TOLD YOU.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.957
DID YOU EVER
KILL ANYBODY ?

27:50.960 --> 27:52.598
I DON'T KNOW.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.591
SHOT AT A FEW.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.125
EVERYBODY THINKS I BURNED DOWN
THIS HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.325
DID YOU ?

27:59.330 --> 28:01.195
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

28:06.800 --> 28:09.598
WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO SHOOT A GUN ?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.558
YOU WANT TO
TRY SOME TIME ?

28:12.560 --> 28:15.358
COME DOWN TO
EAST LOS, BE DOWN.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.499
ARE YOU SERIOUS
BECAUSE I WILL ?

28:19.400 --> 28:22.198
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF
TOUGH LITTLE BITCH, HUH ?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.695
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
YOUR ROAD DOG

28:28.700 --> 28:30.520
CALLING FOR HELP
ON YOUR MACHINE.

28:30.530 --> 28:32.657
YOU AIN'T GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR
GODAMN LIFE

28:32.660 --> 28:34.821
WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T
PICK UP THE PHONE

28:34.830 --> 28:36.991
THE FIRST FUCKING
TIME IT RANG.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.695
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.858
YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT,
LITTLE GIRL.

28:46.030 --> 28:48.590
DON'T WASTE
MY TIME.

28:53.060 --> 28:55.551
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
IS MY FIRST ONE.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.824
AFTER THAT MAN...

28:57.830 --> 29:01.027
I MEAN, I GOT ME THIS ONE RIGHT
HERE WHEN I GOT JUMPED ON.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.588
CHECK IT OUT.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.953
THAT'S VERY
INTRICATE.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.188
YEAH.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.758
AND THIS ONE.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.058
THIS ONE TOOK ME
THREE WEEKS TO HEAL.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.555
THAT'S THE SHIT, HUH ?

29:18.960 --> 29:20.427
CAN I HELP YOU ?

29:20.430 --> 29:22.694
HI, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.224
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ?

29:24.230 --> 29:26.494
FINE.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.751
SO SAD.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.648
I READ ABOUT MANUEL'S
DEATH IN "THE TIMES".

29:29.660 --> 29:31.548
AND I JUST HAD TO
PAY MY RESPECT S.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.892
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.892
THE RIOTS, I MEAN.
"THE UPRISING",

29:36.900 --> 29:38.856
WAS SUPPOSED
TO INCREASE THE PEACE

29:38.860 --> 29:41.090
AND ALL WE HAVE ARE
MORE DEAD CHILDREN.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.522
DID YOU KNOW HIM ?

29:42.530 --> 29:44.919
OH, I FEEL I KNOW ALL
THESE INNOCENT VICTIMS.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.795
THIS IS NOT
A GOOD TIME.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.257
IF YOU'D LIKE TO FORWARD
A CARD TO THE FAMILY--

29:51.260 --> 29:53.694
MAYBE I COULD JUST
STAY A FEW MINUTES.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.689
A CARD.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.656
I'LL DO THAT.

30:15.300 --> 30:18.349
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN MY BABY,

30:18.360 --> 30:20.521
SO HAPPY.

30:20.530 --> 30:24.193
SUCH A SMILE THAT COULD
BREAK YOUR HEART.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.721
WHAT KIND OF GOD
LET'S A BABY LIKE THAT

30:29.730 --> 30:32.198
GET CAUGHT UP
IN ALL THAT SHIT ?

30:34.100 --> 30:35.897
DRUGS.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.221
GUNS.

30:38.230 --> 30:40.528
DEATH.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.422
MRS. BOLIN,

30:48.430 --> 30:51.354
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
THAT IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.397
BUT IT JUST
TAKES TIME.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.722
THIS IS AS BAD
AS IT GETS.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.824
I HAVE NOTHING
TO LIVE FOR.

31:00.830 --> 31:03.697
YOU HAVE
YOUR HUSBAND.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.794
YOU HAVE YOU.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.018
YOU HAVE THE MEMORY
OF THAT LITTLE BABY,

31:09.030 --> 31:11.021
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THAT ALIVE.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.398
MY FATHER DIED
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

31:18.300 --> 31:21.656
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
I NEVER SAID.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.353
NEVER KNEW ABOUT HIM.

31:26.360 --> 31:29.557
BUT HE'S
A PART OF ME.

31:29.560 --> 31:33.155
AND MANNY WILL ALWAYS
BE A PART OF YOU.

31:35.200 --> 31:39.455
WHY DIDN'T GOD TAKE ME
INSTEAD OF MY BOY ?

31:39.460 --> 31:42.020
I DON'T KNOW.

31:44.330 --> 31:47.026
YOU GOTTA APOLOGIZE
TO YOUR BOY, KEITH.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.249
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE
JUST A BORN BITCH.

31:50.260 --> 31:52.558
YOU'RE SPEAKING LIKE THIS
AT YOUR FUNERAL ?

31:52.560 --> 31:54.391
DAMN STRAIGHT.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.925
I'LL SAY WHATEVER
I GODAMN PLEASE.

31:56.930 --> 31:59.922
AND I'VE BEEN TO
A TON OF FUNERALS.

31:59.930 --> 32:01.795
YOU SEEN ONE,

32:01.800 --> 32:03.427
YOU SEEN THEM ALL.

32:03.430 --> 32:05.250
EVEN MINE.

32:05.260 --> 32:07.251
NO GUNFIRE,
NO FIGHTS.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.818
NAH.

32:08.830 --> 32:11.754
NO SHARKS, NO JETS.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.396
JUST LIKE ANY
OTHER FUNERAL.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.993
YOU LET DOWN, HUH ?

32:20.000 --> 32:20.989
A LITTLE.

32:27.430 --> 32:29.751
A DETECTIVE MCBRIDE
JUST CALLED.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.888
THEY MADE A DETERMINATION
OF THE HOUSE FIRE.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.653
THEY TERMED IT
"CAUSE UNKNOWN".

32:35.660 --> 32:37.389
SO, THEY RULED
OUT ARSON.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.288
NO, THEY JUST
CAN'T TELL.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.791
EITHER WAY THE CASE
IS CLOSED.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.825
WHICH DOESN'T
RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY

32:43.830 --> 32:45.297
THAT CLAIRE
SET THAT FIRE.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.052
SHE DIDN'T
DO THAT, NATE.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.357
WHAT IF SHE DID, MOM ?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.794
PRETENDING IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
IS NOT GONNA HELP.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.656
I'M, UH,

32:57.660 --> 32:59.298
SORRY ABOUT
LAST NIGHT,

32:59.300 --> 33:01.427
WITH BRENDA.

33:01.430 --> 33:03.421
WHEN YOU WALKED
IN ON US.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.557
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.951
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.359
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.749
WHEN DID THIS BECOME
A POLICE STATE ?

33:17.800 --> 33:19.722
( laughing )
I NEED AN ALTOID.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.095
THE ORIGINAL SIN,

33:30.100 --> 33:32.921
WASN'T EATING
THE APPLE.

33:32.930 --> 33:36.229
IT WASN'T QUESTIONING
AUTHORITY.

33:36.230 --> 33:40.257
IT WAS NOT GIVING GOD
THE CHANCE TO GIVE HIS SIDE

33:40.260 --> 33:42.455
OF THE ARGUMENT.

33:42.460 --> 33:46.851
IT WAS JUST TAKING
THE SERPENT'S WORD AS GOSPEL.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.749
IT WAS NOT GOING
BACK TO GOD AND SAYING,

33:49.760 --> 33:52.228
"HEY, WHAT GIVES ?"

33:52.230 --> 33:55.028
HE SAID YOU WERE
LYING TO US.

33:55.030 --> 34:00.195
IT WAS JUST ASSUMING
THAT GOD LIES.

34:04.330 --> 34:06.651
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER DAY.

34:08.930 --> 34:10.192
AREN'T
YOU GONNA SAY,

34:10.200 --> 34:11.758
"HEY, MAN,
I'M SORRY, TOO,

34:11.760 --> 34:13.899
FOR REVEALING MY
DORMANT PSYCHO SIDE

34:13.900 --> 34:15.629
AND SCARING THE SHIT
OUT OF YOU" ?

34:15.630 --> 34:17.552
UH-UH.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.851
YOU REALLY THINK
I HATE MYSELF ?

34:21.860 --> 34:23.054
GOOD TO SEE
YOU, DAVID.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.527
HI.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.598
I KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.727
I WAS THERE.

34:33.730 --> 34:36.392
AND I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.698
BUT I'M NOT MOVING
BACKWARDS FOR ANYBODY.

34:38.700 --> 34:40.554
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO MOVE BACKWARDS.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.619
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO BE PATIENT,

34:42.630 --> 34:44.894
AND A LITTLE CALMER.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.095
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT I PUT UP WITH

34:47.100 --> 34:48.453
ON MY JOB EVERY DAY ?

34:48.460 --> 34:51.554
HOW MANY TIMES THE WORD FAG
HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON MY LOCKER ?

34:51.560 --> 34:53.926
HOW MANY TIMES I WONDER GOING
INTO A DANGEROUS SITUATION

34:53.930 --> 34:56.524
IF I'M EVEN GONNA
GET BACK UP ?

34:56.530 --> 34:58.589
WE WERE STEPPED ON
YESTERDAY, DAVID.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.524
AND I DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF IT.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.794
WHEN YOU GET
TIRED OF IT,

35:03.800 --> 35:05.722
YOU LET ME KNOW.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.451
MORNING.

35:15.460 --> 35:17.348
HI.

35:20.430 --> 35:23.752
YOU THINK I SHOULD MAKE
A PEACE OFFERING TO
YOUR MOTHER ?

35:23.760 --> 35:26.752
NO, THAT'LL JUST
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.227
I BROUGHT IT UP
YESTERDAY.

35:28.230 --> 35:29.993
SHE NEARLY
BIT MY HEAD OFF.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.025
JESUS.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.749
IT'S NO ACCIDENT
YOU GUYS ARE UNDERTAKERS.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.296
YOU TAKE EVERY FUCKING
FEELING YOU HAVE

35:36.300 --> 35:38.256
PUT IT IN A BOX
AND BURY IT.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.899
BETTER THAT THEN EXAMINE
EVERY FUCKING MOMENT

35:40.900 --> 35:43.027
UNTIL ALL THE JOY
IS DRAINED OUT OF IT.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.755
COME HERE.

35:58.760 --> 35:59.988
NO.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.059
JUST DO IT.

36:02.060 --> 36:05.689
SEX DOES NOT SOLVE
EVERYTHING, NATE.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.092
I mean, you wouldn't have to
worry about us running wild

36:09.100 --> 36:11.022
while you're working
and we're out Of school.

36:11.030 --> 36:14.921
The family that plays together
stays together.

36:14.930 --> 36:16.898
And it'd be a groovy way
to find out exactly

36:16.900 --> 36:18.788
what's wrong
with this country.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.497
I'd be able to see all
the injustices first hand.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.025
Look, kids, everything
you say makes sense

36:25.030 --> 36:28.295
and it_ would be marvelous
If we could gO...

36:28.300 --> 36:30.928
CLAIRE,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

36:36.400 --> 36:38.755
NO.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.228
DO YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT ?

36:41.230 --> 36:44.199
SURE.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.623
MY PIMP'S THREATENING
TO BEAT ME UP

36:46.630 --> 36:49.019
'CAUSE I CAN'T
TURN ENOUGH TRICKS.

36:49.030 --> 36:50.429
WHAT'S WORSE IS,

36:50.430 --> 36:52.819
HE'S THREATENING
TO TAKE AWAY MY SMACK.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.627
IT'S HELL.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.894
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE SUCH A BITCH ?

37:00.900 --> 37:03.698
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO NATURALLY
ASSUME I'M IN TROUBLE ?

37:03.700 --> 37:06.555
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE
SUCH SHINING EXAMPLES.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.323
JESUS.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.199
She's right, mom.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.725
DO you want Chris to
pump gas all his life ?

37:13.730 --> 37:17.325
And Tracy tO wait on tables
in some sleazy strip joint ?

37:17.330 --> 37:20.754
KROEHNER IS GOING TO KEEP
STRONG-ARMING OUR SUPPLIERS.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.228
UNDERCUTTING US,
STEALING FUNERALS.

37:23.230 --> 37:25.118
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO COMPETE IN TERMS OF

37:25.130 --> 37:27.189
SIZE OR
MARKET PRESENCE.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.419
WHERE WE CAN COMPETE
IS QUALITY OF SERVICE.

37:30.430 --> 37:32.295
INTEGRITY.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.756
WE'LL GIVE THEM
THE HUMAN TOUCH.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.695
IT ALL SOUNDS
GOOD TO ME.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.952
IS THIS OVER ?

37:38.960 --> 37:40.757
BUT WE HAVE TO GET
OUR MESSAGE OUT THERE.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.523
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO
MARKET AND PROMOTE.

37:42.530 --> 37:46.318
REPLACE OUTMODED EQUIPMENT
AND INSTALL COMPUTERS.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.093
FINE.

37:48.100 --> 37:52.218
NOW, IN ORDER TO MAKE
THIS ALL WORK...

37:52.230 --> 37:55.097
WE'LL NEED A SIGNIFICANT
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.091
HOW MUCH ?

37:57.100 --> 37:58.624
$93,000.

37:58.630 --> 38:02.657
YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE YOU $93,000

38:02.660 --> 38:04.651
FROM YOUR FATHER'S
LIFE INSURANCE ?

38:04.660 --> 38:06.355
NOBODY ELSE IS
GOING TO DO IT.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.227
WE'RE STILL PAYING OFF A BANK
NOTE DAD TOOK OUT YEARS AGO.

38:09.230 --> 38:11.118
WE HATE TO ASK,
MOM, BUT...

38:11.130 --> 38:13.155
WE'RE DESPERATE.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.321
OF COURSE,
YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED.

38:15.330 --> 38:16.752
I KNOW THAT.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.891
WHEN DO YOU
NEED IT ?

38:22.660 --> 38:25.026
YOU SURE, MOM ?

38:25.030 --> 38:27.590
BUT IT'S
NOT A LOAN.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.388
I'M NOW AN INVESTOR
IN FISHER AND SONS.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.995
WE'LL ESTABLISH A FAIR
PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY

38:35.000 --> 38:37.355
AND RATE OF RETURN.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.797
I CAN INVEST IN EITHER
MY BOYS OR TECH STOCKS.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.052
ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN THE TRACK.

38:48.260 --> 38:50.194
DAVID,

38:50.200 --> 38:52.498
I'D LIKE IT IF YOU'D
COME WITH ME TO CHURCH

38:52.500 --> 38:56.129
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
NOW THAT YOUR FATHER'S GONE.

38:56.130 --> 38:58.428
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO GO ALONE.

38:58.430 --> 39:00.751
OKAY.

39:06.730 --> 39:08.857
WELL, THAT WAS WEIRD.

39:08.860 --> 39:10.828
IT GETS WEIRDER.

39:10.830 --> 39:12.889
THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON
MY MACHINE FROM GILARDI.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.198
HE WANTS TO MEET
WITH US, TODAY.

39:18.830 --> 39:21.321
HEY, DOG.

39:21.330 --> 39:24.254
GETTING READY TO
THROW SOME BLOWS ?

39:24.260 --> 39:27.320
IF YOU WERE ME, PACO,
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO GILARDI ?

39:27.330 --> 39:29.252
WHAT WOULD YOU DO ?

39:29.260 --> 39:31.023
IF I WAS YOU ?

39:31.030 --> 39:34.397
IF I WAS YOU, I WOULDN'T
OWN A FUCKING FUNERAL HOME.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.857
BUT, ALRIGHT.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.397
ALRIG HT, SAY,

39:39.400 --> 39:42.358
I'M DOING MY THING,
SELLING MY SHIT.

39:42.360 --> 39:46.490
SOME PUNK ASS TRIES TO
CLOCK ME FROM MY CORNER.

39:48.330 --> 39:49.991
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY ?

39:52.430 --> 39:54.625
I SAY, "KEEP THIS
MOTHERFUCKER !

39:54.630 --> 39:57.793
"FIVE O'CLOCK, YOU NEAR ME,
MY CORNER OR MY SHIT,

39:57.800 --> 40:01.054
"I'LL CUT YOUR FUCKING STOMACH,
WATCH YOUR GUTS SPILL OUT.

40:01.060 --> 40:04.928
"I'LL LET YOU LIVE UNTIL
YOU SLOWLY BLEED TO DEATH.

40:04.930 --> 40:07.558
IN FRONT OF
YOUR FUCKING KIDS."

40:09.360 --> 40:11.021
( coughing )

40:15.400 --> 40:16.958
YOU FEEL
YOUR HEART RACING ?

40:19.860 --> 40:22.522
WHEN THE OTHER GUY
FEELS LIKE THAT...

40:22.530 --> 40:24.725
YOU WON.

40:24.730 --> 40:27.324
C'MON, DAVID.

40:27.330 --> 40:29.252
YOU GOTTA
STAND UP, MAN.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.490
YOU GOTTA STEP UP.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.821
YOU STEPPED UP,
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.094
THAT'S RIGHT.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.251
FOR 20 YEARS, I LIVED
MY LIFE LIKE A MAN.

40:39.260 --> 40:42.388
WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA START ?

40:48.860 --> 40:50.828
YOU LOWERED
YOUR OFFER.

40:50.830 --> 40:53.196
WHAT CAN I SAY,
THE MARKET FLUCTUATES.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.998
THANKS, BUT WE DON'T SEE
A NEED TO ALIGN OURSELVES

40:56.000 --> 40:57.524
WITH KROEHNER
RIGHT NOW.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.491
OKAY.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.151
I'LL MAKE IT SIMPLE.

41:04.160 --> 41:07.095
YOU EITHER ACCEPT OUR OFFER
BY THE END OF THE DAY

41:07.100 --> 41:08.419
OR I'LL MAKE IT
MY PERSONAL MISSION

41:08.430 --> 41:10.694
TO BURY YOU BY THE END
OF THE MONTH.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.589
DAVID, YOU IN ON
THIS SUICIDE MISSION ?

41:17.660 --> 41:19.252
DAVID ?

41:21.560 --> 41:23.596
YOU JUST THREATENED
MY FAMILY.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.158
LET'S NOT BE
MELODRAMATIC.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.697
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT US
TO DO, RUN AND HIDE ?

41:27.700 --> 41:31.022
SELL AND BE GRATEFUL,
PACK UP AND MOVE ?

41:31.030 --> 41:32.759
IF YOU'RE SMART.

41:34.130 --> 41:36.792
YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE KROEHNER
ORGANIZATION BEHIND YOU.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.153
AND WHAT
DO WE HAVE ?

41:40.030 --> 41:42.157
YOU.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.890
BECAUSE ONE DAY WHEN YOUR MIND
ISN'T ON FISHER AND SONS,

41:44.900 --> 41:47.698
I WILL FIND YOU
OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.952
( laughing )

41:49.960 --> 41:53.748
I'M NOT SAYING ANYONE
IS GOING TO DIE.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.627
THERE ARE TRAGEDIES
FAR WORSE THAN DEATH.

41:56.630 --> 41:58.791
THINGS YOU COULDN'T
EVEN DREAM OF,

41:58.800 --> 42:01.758
YOU SPINELESS, CANDY-ASS,
CORPORATE FUCK.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.819
JUST GIVE ME A REASON.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.393
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.527
ARE WE REALLY WORTH
THE TROUBLE, MR. GILARDI ?

42:17.930 --> 42:21.127
LUNCH IS OVER,
GET LOST.

42:23.130 --> 42:25.348
ARE YOU DEAF ?

42:34.200 --> 42:35.656
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THAT ?

42:35.660 --> 42:37.628
I THINK
I'M GONNA THROW UP.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.295
HI.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.351
I HOPE YOU LIKE
FANCY BATH STUFF.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.794
I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY
AT THE BEVERLY CENTER.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.257
THANK YOU.

42:52.260 --> 42:54.490
THIS WASN'T
N ECESSARY.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.559
YES, IT WAS.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.152
I'M AFRAID YOU MIGHT
NOT HAVE SEEN ME

42:58.160 --> 43:00.253
IN MY BEST LIGHT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

43:00.260 --> 43:02.797
I SAW MORE OF YOU
THAN I CARED TO.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.325
OKAY.

43:05.330 --> 43:07.992
UH, LOOK.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.198
I'M NOT A VERY
TRADITIONAL PERSON.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.089
AND I DON'T
REALLY KNOW

43:15.100 --> 43:17.523
WHAT'S HAPPENING
BETWEEN ME AND NATE,

43:17.530 --> 43:21.591
BUT EVERY ONCE
IN AWHILE I GET...

43:21.600 --> 43:27.618
A GLIMPSE OF THINGS MAYBE
WORKING OUT FOR US AND...

43:29.560 --> 43:32.927
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

43:38.330 --> 43:40.355
BE CAREFUL
WITH HIM.

43:40.360 --> 43:44.399
HE'S A LOT MORE FRAGILE
THEN HE'D LIKE TO THINK.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.857
AREN'T WE ALL ?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.595
WELL...

43:50.600 --> 43:52.921
THANK YOU.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.488
MY PLEASURE.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.852
FISHERS AROUND ?

44:07.860 --> 44:09.521
YOU NEED DAVID ?

44:09.530 --> 44:11.418
ALL OF THEM,

44:11.430 --> 44:13.295
OKAY, JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.097
JUST GET 'EM,
ALRIGHT ?

44:27.630 --> 44:29.359
WILL YOU JOIN US ?

44:45.860 --> 44:48.328
MERCIFUL JESUS,

44:48.330 --> 44:52.050
PLEASE BRING
REST AND PEACE

44:52.060 --> 44:55.928
TO OUR FALLEN
BROTHER, SON,

44:55.930 --> 44:59.422
FRIEND...

44:59.430 --> 45:02.888
MANUEL PACO BOLIN.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.657
MAY HE LIVE
WITH YOU,

45:08.660 --> 45:11.458
FOREVER IN
YOUR LIGHTENED TRUTH.

45:11.460 --> 45:13.758
ALMIGHTY FATHER.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.590
AMEN.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.051
WE ALSO WANNA THANK
THE FISHERS

45:23.060 --> 45:26.154
WHO LOST A FATHER,

45:26.160 --> 45:29.323
AND HUSBAND.

45:29.330 --> 45:32.697
LORD BRING PEACE
TO THEM IN THEIR GRIEF.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.318
AS YOU HAVE IN OURS.

45:43.930 --> 45:45.852
WE'LL MISS YOU.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.426
LET GO OF ME,
YOU FUCKING FAG.

46:07.430 --> 46:10.524
I GOTS TO GO.

46:10.530 --> 46:12.498
JESUS, YOU'RE
JUST A KID.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.925
SO ARE YOU.

46:32.860 --> 46:34.020
HEY, DAVID...

46:35.800 --> 46:37.859
DON'T BE A BITCH.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.529
SHIT.

46:54.530 --> 46:56.191
NOW, I KNOW WHY YOU
WANTED TO GO BOWLING

46:56.200 --> 46:57.724
INSTEAD OF
SEEING A MOVIE.

46:57.730 --> 46:59.527
I WAS ALL STATE CHAMPION
IN THE YOUTH FOR CHRIST

46:59.530 --> 47:01.191
BOWLING LEAGUE
WHEN I WAS 17.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.156
YOU'RE GONNA BEAT
THE PANTS OFF ME.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.458
THAT'S MY INTENT.

47:05.460 --> 47:07.621
I GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE

47:07.630 --> 47:09.757
AND I STILL CANNOT FIGURE
HOW THIS SCORING WORKS.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.149
HEY, YOU FELLAS
TOGETHER ?

47:13.860 --> 47:16.693
YEAH, WE ARE.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.725
THAT'S COOL.

47:28.430 --> 47:30.455
HEY, BREN,
THE DOOR IS UNLOCKED.

47:33.230 --> 47:34.629
BRENDA ?

47:34.630 --> 47:36.393
IN THE BEDROOM.

47:37.830 --> 47:39.923
I'M JUST HERE TO
DELIVER A PIZZA, MA'AM,

47:39.930 --> 47:41.420
I DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE.

47:41.430 --> 47:43.751
I GOT YOUR TIP
RIGHT HERE.

47:45.300 --> 47:46.699
WHOA.

47:49.030 --> 47:50.952
WHERE'S MY PIZZA ?

47:57.500 --> 47:59.593
MOM ASKED ME
TO TELL YOU

47:59.600 --> 48:01.898
THAT THE LAVENDER
BATH SCRUB...

48:01.900 --> 48:04.653
WAS SIMPLY DELICIOUS.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.720
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO EAT IT.

48:10.630 --> 48:12.598
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE CANDLES ?

48:12.600 --> 48:15.091
I'M BURNING UP.

48:15.100 --> 48:18.524
BURNING UP
FOR YOUR LOVE.

48:29.130 --> 48:30.324
WHAT ?

48:35.330 --> 48:36.888
WHAT ?

48:37.660 --> 48:39.491
WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY
LIKE SOME GUY ENOUGH

48:39.500 --> 48:41.252
TO HAVE HIS NAME
BURNED IN YOUR FLESH.

48:41.260 --> 48:43.319
I WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT
MORE THAN THAT FOR HIM.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.125
WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU ?

48:49.360 --> 48:51.999
I HAD A REALLY
WEIRD DAY.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.554
OH.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.949
POOR BABY.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.398
( door Opening )

49:38.430 --> 49:40.796
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY ?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.028
FINE.

49:44.630 --> 49:46.621
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING ?

49:46.630 --> 49:49.394
YOU PROMISE TO
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.994
MAYBE.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.821
DID YOU SET
THAT FIRE ?

49:54.830 --> 49:56.695
NO.

49:56.700 --> 49:58.827
NO, I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

50:01.630 --> 50:03.825
I MAY HAVE SWIPED
THAT FOOT, THOUGH.

50:08.660 --> 50:11.322
DIN NER'S
ALMOST READY.
