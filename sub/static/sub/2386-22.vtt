00:00.516 --> 00:03.006
<i>In May of 2012,</i>
<i>Marshall and Lily</i>

00:03.009 --> 00:04.843
<i>hosted a baby shower</i>
<i>in the apartment.</i>

00:04.845 --> 00:06.227
<i>All their friends were there.</i>

00:06.229 --> 00:08.880
<i>So of course I made sure</i>
<i>to show up exactly...</i>

00:09.933 --> 00:11.266
<i>...three hours late.</i>

00:11.268 --> 00:14.352
- Oh, no! Am I late?
- Little bit.

00:14.354 --> 00:17.522
Ah, I'm sorry, I would've gotten
here earlier; it's just, um...

00:17.524 --> 00:20.108
- You didn't want to see Robin.
- I didn't want to see Robin.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.310
I know, it's childish.

00:22.312 --> 00:23.478
She's not here, is she?

00:23.480 --> 00:24.963
Actually...

00:25.764 --> 00:30.068
Oh, no! Am I early?

00:30.070 --> 00:31.769
Little bit.

00:33.372 --> 00:36.040
Whoa, she got you
the red stroller?

00:36.042 --> 00:40.461
Looks like I just blew her
out of the water.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.964
Anyway, he left
before the party started.

00:42.966 --> 00:44.782
Ah, I'm really sorry, I...

00:44.784 --> 00:46.751
I just think it's
best if Robin and I

00:46.753 --> 00:48.503
don't see each
other for a while.

00:48.505 --> 00:51.122
Ted, it's fine;
I'm a child of divorce.

00:51.124 --> 00:53.091
You guys keep fighting
all you want,

00:53.093 --> 00:55.143
as long as the expensive gifts
keep coming.

00:55.145 --> 00:57.228
Uh, so
how was the shower?

00:57.230 --> 00:58.479
It was good,

00:58.481 --> 01:00.181
although there was
one weird moment

01:00.183 --> 01:02.450
with Barney's new
stripper girlfriend.

01:02.452 --> 01:04.102
50 laps a day?

01:04.104 --> 01:07.188
Oh, my goodness, young lady.
That is a lot.

01:07.190 --> 01:08.907
Oh, is it?

01:08.909 --> 01:11.809
Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?

01:11.811 --> 01:14.862
Yes, my girlfriend
gets naked

01:14.864 --> 01:16.497
and sits on guys' laps
for money.

01:16.499 --> 01:19.867
And, yes, sometimes it's as
many as 50 laps in one day.

01:19.869 --> 01:23.288
And maybe society
considers what she does

01:23.290 --> 01:25.373
to be "disgusting,"

01:25.375 --> 01:26.991
or "slutty,"

01:26.993 --> 01:29.877
or verging on "prostitution,"

01:29.879 --> 01:32.830
or actual "prostitution."

01:32.832 --> 01:35.099
But you know what,
I accept her.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.552
And if you can't do the same,

01:37.554 --> 01:40.671
well, then shame on you.

01:41.941 --> 01:43.942
Shame...

01:43.944 --> 01:45.176
on...

01:45.178 --> 01:46.844
you.

01:48.314 --> 01:52.033
We were, um, talking
about swimming.

01:52.035 --> 01:55.703
How I sometimes swim
50 laps a day.

01:57.289 --> 01:58.990
Well,
it's great cardio.

01:58.992 --> 02:01.960
Lois, can I top off
your champagne?

02:06.611 --> 02:10.610
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

02:15.939 --> 02:17.239
You know, it's funny,

02:17.241 --> 02:19.808
you tell the average guy
you're dating a stripper,

02:19.810 --> 02:20.976
he thinks it's awesome.

02:20.978 --> 02:23.478
Heck, you tell your mom,
she high-fives you so fast,

02:23.480 --> 02:25.147
she doesn't even
take off her oven mitts.

02:25.149 --> 02:27.416
But if they had any idea

02:27.418 --> 02:30.319
how difficult it is:
the jealousy,

02:30.321 --> 02:32.171
the insecurity,

02:32.173 --> 02:37.042
those high-fives would be
high-fives of condolence.

02:37.044 --> 02:40.963
Barney, condolence high-fives
are not a thing.

02:40.965 --> 02:42.298
They're a thing.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.817
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

02:46.052 --> 02:47.519
Up top.

02:48.505 --> 02:52.024
Ah, listen to me
and my boring couples' problems.

02:52.026 --> 02:53.442
How are you?

02:53.444 --> 02:54.877
How's the single life?

02:54.879 --> 02:57.179
I wouldn't know.
After this whole Robin thing,

02:57.181 --> 02:59.198
for the time being,
I'm laying low.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.616
Laying low as in

03:00.618 --> 03:03.235
sleeping with a really
short chick?

03:03.237 --> 03:04.519
You guys doing 39?

03:04.521 --> 03:06.405
I mean, I'm not seeing anyone.

03:06.407 --> 03:09.124
I'm just, you know, trying
to get Robin out of my head.

03:09.126 --> 03:11.627
You need a palate cleanser.

03:11.629 --> 03:13.245
Barney, please,
don't try to set me up

03:13.247 --> 03:15.414
with Quinn's stripper friends.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

03:15.416 --> 03:17.733
Why not, how many hints
do I have to drop?!

03:17.735 --> 03:20.886
No, I'm thinking of something
much more traditional.

03:20.888 --> 03:23.705
Online dating.
Yeah, no thanks.

03:23.707 --> 03:25.724
Come on, Ted! It's 2012.

03:25.726 --> 03:28.727
What do you expect,
to meet some cute travel agent

03:28.729 --> 03:31.313
when you're reading a newspaper
at a bookstore?

03:31.315 --> 03:33.315
None of those things
exist anymore.

03:33.317 --> 03:36.218
Barney, I will never, ever,

03:36.220 --> 03:39.054
ever, try online dating.

03:39.056 --> 03:40.906
<i>That night</i>
<i>I tried online dating.</i>

03:40.908 --> 03:44.076
<i>And kids, the first girl</i>

03:44.078 --> 03:48.330
<i>beautiful, smart, funny, huge</i>
<i>fan of prewar architecture,</i>

03:48.332 --> 03:51.266
<i>favorite poet Neruda,</i>
<i>favorite movie</i> Ghostbusters,

03:51.268 --> 03:53.235
and she didn't hate Cleveland.

03:53.237 --> 03:55.170
She's perfect.

03:55.172 --> 03:56.905
<i>So I sent her an email,</i>

03:56.907 --> 03:59.942
<i>inviting her to mini golf.</i>

04:04.632 --> 04:07.216
- Hello.
- Mini golf?

04:07.218 --> 04:09.218
Mini golf? Who takes
a first date to mini golf?

04:09.220 --> 04:10.386
I'm coming over!

04:11.221 --> 04:13.939
Oh, Ted-Ted-Ted-
Teddy-Ted-Ted.

04:13.941 --> 04:14.620
Who buzzed you in?

04:14.645 --> 04:16.644
Did you really think you
could start dating online,

04:16.726 --> 04:17.776
and I wouldn't find out?

04:17.778 --> 04:21.279
But with thi-this
girl, sh-she was...

04:21.281 --> 04:23.198
Me. She was me, Ted.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.068
The photo was just of some girl
I knew you'd never seen before,

04:26.070 --> 04:28.454
a very famous sports anchor
on ESPN.

04:28.456 --> 04:32.491
Barney, I don't need you to
help me find a girl online.

04:32.493 --> 04:34.776
Exactly because I've
already done it!

04:34.778 --> 04:36.328
Three girls in fact.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.580
I scoured the dating sites

04:38.582 --> 04:40.749
using my own personal
logarithms,

04:40.751 --> 04:43.085
factoring in a broad
spectrum of variables,

04:43.087 --> 04:45.587
filtering out undesirable
high-risk negatives,

04:45.589 --> 04:48.307
guaranteeing a success
rate of 83...

04:48.309 --> 04:50.292
You picked the girls
that showed the most boob.

04:50.294 --> 04:52.561
My methods get results.

04:52.563 --> 04:55.064
Go out with
these three girls,

04:55.066 --> 04:56.932
and your palate is going
to be so cleansed,

04:56.934 --> 04:58.434
you will see
your reflection in it.

04:58.436 --> 05:00.069
And when you do,

05:00.071 --> 05:02.905
you can fix the hair, because...
Have you seen yourself?

05:02.907 --> 05:05.274
No, but you know
what I have seen,

05:05.276 --> 05:07.910
your stripper
girlfriend's cans. Wow.

05:07.912 --> 05:09.027
Wow.
Wow, wow.

05:09.029 --> 05:10.996
That was going way
too far, wasn't it?

05:10.998 --> 05:12.498
I'm sorry.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.583
My condolences.

05:15.702 --> 05:17.086
Come on.

05:18.654 --> 05:22.657
Man, Marshall's really
stressing out about this baby.

05:22.659 --> 05:24.126
He's reading every book,

05:24.128 --> 05:26.295
watching breast-feeding
documentaries.

05:26.297 --> 05:29.515
I woke up the other day,
he had swaddled me.

05:29.517 --> 05:33.001
Sure, it was the best night's
sleep I had had in months,

05:33.003 --> 05:34.520
but still...

05:34.522 --> 05:36.221
You know
what his latest thing is?

05:39.527 --> 05:41.527
What the hell is that?

05:46.283 --> 05:48.901
Marshall,
what is that?

05:48.903 --> 05:51.487
I rigged this alarm
to go off every three hours.

05:51.489 --> 05:53.522
I'm training myself for the

05:53.524 --> 05:56.191
sporadic sleep patterns
of early parenthood.

05:56.193 --> 05:57.242
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:57.244 --> 06:00.646
I have a practice-baby
to soothe.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.000
You got to talk to him.

06:05.002 --> 06:07.002
Yeah, I'll talk
to him tonight.

06:07.004 --> 06:08.804
Maybe tomorrow morning.

06:08.806 --> 06:09.871
One last swaddle?

06:09.873 --> 06:10.973
It's just so cozy.

06:10.975 --> 06:13.559
It's like sleeping
in a warm burrito.

06:13.561 --> 06:15.561
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Barney was about to have</i>

06:15.563 --> 06:17.312
<i>a stripper's boyfriend's</i>
<i>worst nightmare.</i>

06:17.314 --> 06:18.847
Karma?

06:18.849 --> 06:20.382
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't recognize you

06:20.384 --> 06:21.883
without your legs
behind your head.

06:21.885 --> 06:24.069
Darryl, I didn't
recognize you

06:24.071 --> 06:25.437
without your
creepy trench coat.

06:25.439 --> 06:26.522
How are you?

06:26.524 --> 06:28.407
Great, you working tomorrow?
You know it.

06:28.409 --> 06:30.108
Great. I'll be there
with bells on.

06:30.110 --> 06:32.861
And by bells,
I mean super thin sweatpants.

06:32.863 --> 06:35.113
Gross.

06:35.115 --> 06:37.866
He's actually a nice guy.

06:37.868 --> 06:39.234
She's so busy
as deputy mayor,

06:39.236 --> 06:41.086
but I always get a card
on my birthday.

06:41.088 --> 06:44.289
Quinn, I love the fact
that you're a stripper,

06:44.291 --> 06:46.792
but I hate the fact
that you're a stripper.

06:46.794 --> 06:49.761
Barney, I like my job.

06:49.763 --> 06:51.930
And I do not need
to be rescued.

06:51.932 --> 06:54.967
So, don't be that guy.

06:54.969 --> 06:56.268
You're right, you're right.

06:56.270 --> 06:58.554
I got it.
Forget I said anything.

06:58.556 --> 06:59.555
Hmm.

06:59.557 --> 07:01.190
I'll see you
tonight, Karma.

07:01.192 --> 07:02.891
You got it,
Dirty Larry.

07:02.893 --> 07:05.027
You have to quit your job!

07:05.029 --> 07:06.478
<i>That night, I went out</i>

07:06.480 --> 07:08.530
<i>with the first girl</i>
<i>Barney picked for me.</i>

07:08.532 --> 07:09.898
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

07:09.900 --> 07:11.817
Your name is Robin?

07:11.819 --> 07:13.785
Yeah, with a Y.

07:13.787 --> 07:16.405
Oh, <i>Yobin.</i>

07:16.407 --> 07:18.156
No, Robin.

07:18.158 --> 07:21.276
I go by ScotchAndGunLover
in my online profile,

07:21.278 --> 07:23.128
'cause those are
my two favorite things.

07:23.130 --> 07:26.281
Well, next to Canada,
my home and native land.

07:26.283 --> 07:29.051
Oh. Canada.

07:29.053 --> 07:31.003
<i>And just like that,</i>

07:31.005 --> 07:33.555
<i>Robyn became Robin.</i>

07:33.557 --> 07:36.091
How's it going, Ted?

07:38.782 --> 07:42.382
Oh, good. Hey, look,
mommy's back from the bar!

07:42.829 --> 07:44.795
Now I can finally take a shower.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.334
This diaper smells.
I don't want to know.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.420
Okay, Marshall,

07:52.422 --> 07:54.722
sit down; we need to talk.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.876
Look, I know
you mean well,

07:58.878 --> 08:01.395
but we have five weeks
till the due date.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.182
Can't we use this
time to just relax?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.217
We'll figure out
how all this stuff

08:06.219 --> 08:08.052
works after
the baby comes.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.770
After the baby comes?

08:09.772 --> 08:11.555
Yeah, we'll learn
on the job.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.858
Learn on the j... Huh.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.194
Wow, you know, Lily,

08:16.196 --> 08:18.946
maybe the crisis here isn't that
I'm not ready to be a dad;

08:18.948 --> 08:21.199
maybe it's that
you're not ready to be a mom!

08:21.201 --> 08:22.399
Excuse me?!
Yeah.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.901
<i>With that,</i>
<i>an argument began,</i>

08:23.903 --> 08:26.587
the details of which are still
<i>hotly debated to this day.</i>

08:26.589 --> 08:29.207
<i>For instance, Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>swears he never said:</i>

08:29.209 --> 08:31.654
I'm the only one making
sacrifices for this baby!

08:31.655 --> 08:32.125
What?!

08:32.128 --> 08:34.462
<i>And he claims he never</i>
<i>actually uttered the words:</i>

08:34.464 --> 08:36.246
It's like you don't even know
that you're pregnant!

08:36.249 --> 08:38.716
<i>While Lily insists</i>
<i>this part was exaggerated:</i>

08:38.717 --> 08:40.618
Baby's are easy; you just

08:40.620 --> 08:42.720
watch them be cute
and feed them spaghetti!

08:42.722 --> 08:45.640
<i>But everyone agrees</i>
<i>this is how the argument ended:</i>

08:45.642 --> 08:48.359
Marshall, what I need now
is some peace, some quiet,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.144
and now that it's out there,
some spaghetti.

08:50.146 --> 08:53.364
Now, please help me off
the couch so I can storm out.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.201
Huh!

09:00.205 --> 09:03.074
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>I filled Barney in on my date.</i>

09:03.076 --> 09:05.442
Oh, Yobin.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.944
No, Robin.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.746
And for the rest of the night,

09:08.748 --> 09:11.882
every time I looked at her,
I just saw Robin's face.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.418
Well, I should hope so.
No, our Robin.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.786
Robin with an I.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.888
Uh, our Robin has
two eyes, my friend.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.141
But that's good. You're
forgetting what she looks like.

09:20.976 --> 09:23.427
I'm sorry, that must
have been tough.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.680
If anyone knows what
that feels like, it's me.

09:25.682 --> 09:27.682
My condolences.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.237
Okay. Moving on.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.240
perfect palate cleanser.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.575
Nothing like Robin.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.809
How nothing?

09:38.811 --> 09:41.412
I gaze out into the world
and all I see

09:41.414 --> 09:44.982
is an icy place
where dreams die.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.869
Ooh, lasagna.

09:48.871 --> 09:51.339
How's it going, Ted?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.341
What? No. What? Wh-Why?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.459
Remember, I made lasagna
that one time.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.794
That's all it takes?

09:56.796 --> 09:59.297
It wasn't even lasagna;
you took your botched kugle

09:59.299 --> 10:00.848
and poured tomato sauce on it.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.551
I didn't say
it was good lasagna.

10:03.553 --> 10:06.203
By the way, what are you doing
with this girl?

10:06.205 --> 10:08.639
With tattoos all up
and down her arms and...

10:08.641 --> 10:12.526
everywhere else.
Hello... good gravy.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.945
Does that dragons tail go
all the way down to her...

10:14.947 --> 10:17.681
Ohh, yes, it does.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.734
Well, what do you want me
to do, Robin?

10:19.736 --> 10:21.535
I have to get over you somehow,

10:21.537 --> 10:23.187
and if this is what it takes...

10:23.189 --> 10:25.139
Are you okay?

10:26.524 --> 10:28.159
Yeah. Why?

10:28.161 --> 10:30.661
You kind of spaced out there.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.496
Weirdo.

10:33.582 --> 10:35.249
"So, in summation,

10:35.251 --> 10:36.634
I'm very, very sorry."

10:36.636 --> 10:38.803
"I guess I just wanted
you all to myself,

10:38.805 --> 10:41.505
"and then I thought of all the
creepy guys groping at your...

10:41.507 --> 10:42.807
"Okay, I'm getting mad again,

10:42.809 --> 10:44.208
"so I'm going to
stop writing now.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.812
Please enjoy these chocolates,
may contain peanuts."

10:47.814 --> 10:48.996
Kiss and make up?

10:52.401 --> 10:55.052
Have sex up against the window
and make up? -

10:55.054 --> 10:57.355
You do have a great view.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.273
Well, funny you
should mention that.

10:59.275 --> 11:00.358
It's <i>your</i> view.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.693
Come again for Big Fudge?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.678
Congratulations. You're hired.

11:05.563 --> 11:06.697
You are Goliath National Bank's

11:06.699 --> 11:09.500
newest executive
strategy coordinator.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.336
What is an executive
strategy coordinator?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.422
It's three
corporate-sounding words

11:14.424 --> 11:16.674
which, when added together,
equal a fake job

11:16.676 --> 11:19.126
for which you get
a real paycheck

11:19.128 --> 11:21.745
in the amount of exactly
what you'd make stripping.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.747
Plus dental. You're welcs.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.850
Now, about that
up-against-the-window sex...

11:25.852 --> 11:27.635
Dude, I don't want
to work for a bank.

11:27.637 --> 11:28.519
Why not?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.504
Because I have standards.

11:30.506 --> 11:31.856
You people are whores.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.091
The things you're willing
to do just for some money,

11:34.093 --> 11:35.592
it's shameful.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.928
You work in a strip club.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.864
Yeah, and I like it.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.432
And I'm good at it.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.483
Barney,

11:42.485 --> 11:45.236
if I took this job,
you would own me.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.954
I would be willingly
stepping into a cage,

11:46.956 --> 11:48.622
which is something I don't do.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.325
Except on Thursdays, when it's
cage night at the Lusty Leopard,

11:51.327 --> 11:52.493
but that's a cardboard cage,

11:52.495 --> 11:54.795
and I can get out of it
any time I want.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.996
You can?

11:55.998 --> 11:58.249
Wow, thanks
for ruining cage night.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.134
- Come on, Quinn.
- No.

12:00.136 --> 12:00.835
I wouldn't...
Nope.

12:00.837 --> 12:02.970
Don't.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.122
I think I have
some thinking to do.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.058
I...

12:08.060 --> 12:09.226
Mr. Stinson?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.978
Does this mean
I get to keep my job?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.215
Yeah, Herm, you can stay.

12:14.217 --> 12:15.900
Hey, baby, listen.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.968
I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.236
Oh, that's okay.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.522
To be fair, maybe I'm at fault

12:21.524 --> 12:23.307
for loving our child too much,

12:23.309 --> 12:25.659
although that is the definition
of parenting, so...

12:25.661 --> 12:26.810
All right, good make up.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.412
Hey, listen, I went online,

12:28.414 --> 12:30.531
and I found
this Baby Boot Camp thing

12:30.533 --> 12:33.250
that they're doing at a hotel
in Paramus this weekend.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.502
Baby Boot Camp?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.753
That sounds great.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.037
Yeah, it's a two-day event...

12:37.039 --> 12:38.155
We're going.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.790
...and there's lots
of seminars and classes.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.175
You've already made the sale.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.510
Anyway, I signed us up.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.928
Not even listening anymore;
mentally packing.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.163
I'm trying to figure out
the best way to get to Paramus

12:46.165 --> 12:47.348
without hitting any tolls.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.665
This is gonna be great.

12:50.051 --> 12:52.002
And that was the last time

12:52.004 --> 12:54.772
I'll ever go out with a guy
with a mustache.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.224
<i>This is good.</i>

12:57.226 --> 12:59.727
<i>This is nice, not thinking</i>
<i>about you-know-who.</i>

12:59.729 --> 13:01.645
<i>Just having a good time</i>

13:01.647 --> 13:03.731
and thanking God I didn't grow
<i>that mustache.</i>

13:03.733 --> 13:05.182
And you,

13:05.184 --> 13:07.518
you're so polite.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.205
My ex-fiancé, Wayne,
he had no manners.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.740
<i>Wayne had no manners.</i>

13:12.742 --> 13:14.575
<i>Wayne... manners...</i>

13:14.577 --> 13:17.912
<i>Wayne Manor,</i>
<i>home of Bruce Wayne,</i>

13:17.914 --> 13:19.730
<i>better known as Batman,</i>

13:19.732 --> 13:22.299
<i>mentor to Dick Grayson,</i>
<i>his orphan ward</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:24.502
<i>who at night would don</i>
<i>the colorful vestments</i>

13:24.504 --> 13:26.420
<i>of the Boy Wonder, aka...</i>

13:26.422 --> 13:28.172
Robin.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.509
Holy long walk for a short drink
of water, Ted.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.510
Stop this.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.512
I need you out of my life
for real.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.063
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.064
No, you don't.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.882
Look how much is changing
right now.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.185
Marshall and Lily
are having a baby.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.886
Barney's shacking up
with a girl.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.021
With your whole world

13:44.023 --> 13:45.489
turning upside down,

13:45.491 --> 13:46.907
isn't a friendship like this one

13:46.909 --> 13:50.361
something you want to hold on to
as tightly as possible?

13:52.330 --> 13:56.000
And every time I look at you,
it hurts.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.502
...and that's the story
of my only lesbian experience.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.954
I'm sorry

13:59.956 --> 14:01.922
for going into so much detail.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.375
I'll never tell
that story again.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.076
Anyway, how's your meal?

14:06.078 --> 14:08.412
Holly, listen,
I should probably tell you,

14:08.414 --> 14:12.099
um, I'm kind of getting
over someone right now.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.552
I am so glad you said that.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.087
I guess I'm still
getting over Wayne.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.939
It's been really hard.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.725
Can I interest you
in some sorbet?

14:21.727 --> 14:24.228
You two look like you could both
use a palate cleanser.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.936
How's your palate, Ted?

14:31.938 --> 14:34.121
Pretty cleansed.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.909
You know, at this seminar,

14:38.911 --> 14:40.961
there's gonna be the
one guy who's, like,

14:40.963 --> 14:43.631
Mr. Parenting Expert, keeps
interrupting the speakers

14:43.633 --> 14:45.449
with his own "important facts."

14:45.451 --> 14:47.635
And you're gonna be sitting
right next to him,

14:47.637 --> 14:50.137
so get ready for that.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.673
Baby, you've been a little
sleep deprived lately.

14:52.675 --> 14:54.725
Why don't you let me drive?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.628
You know what, that's
not such a bad idea.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.796
I mean, the last thing we want

14:59.798 --> 15:03.233
is for me to get
behind the wheel and just...

15:05.000 --> 15:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:12.161 --> 15:14.945
Oh, baby, you smell good.

15:14.947 --> 15:17.414
When we get to that hotel,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.000
I'm gonna wear
your pregnant belly like a hat.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.619
You'll have to buy me

15:21.621 --> 15:23.170
a couple of
cocktails first.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.821
Bar-Barney!

15:24.823 --> 15:26.490
Where are we?

15:26.492 --> 15:29.510
Atlantic City, baby!

15:29.512 --> 15:31.679
Well, in 14 miles.

15:34.744 --> 15:36.548
What the hell is going on?

15:36.648 --> 15:37.880
And where is Lily?

15:37.882 --> 15:40.383
And what did you do
to the practice baby?

15:40.385 --> 15:42.718
And is there any left?

15:42.720 --> 15:45.238
Lily was worried about you.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.690
She thought you needed
to unwind, so...

15:47.692 --> 15:50.893
I mean, the last thing
we want is for me to

15:50.895 --> 15:53.329
get behind the wheel
and just...

15:57.785 --> 15:59.786
<i>She made reservations</i>
<i>for two deluxe rooms,</i>

15:59.788 --> 16:01.237
<i>massages, and dinner</i>
<i>at the Palm,</i>

16:01.239 --> 16:04.207
<i>and in return,</i>
<i>I made her cookies.</i>

16:06.677 --> 16:09.912
So, there's no Baby Boot Camp
at the Paramus Waldorf?

16:11.548 --> 16:13.266
Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?

16:13.268 --> 16:14.717
Bro...

16:14.719 --> 16:17.220
I am so mad at Lily right now.

16:17.222 --> 16:20.807
She knew you would be;
that's why she packed this.

16:20.809 --> 16:23.142
Aw.

16:23.144 --> 16:25.561
My mad-at-Lily shirt.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.264
I had this made for me

16:28.266 --> 16:30.283
and my high school
girlfriend, Steph.

16:30.285 --> 16:32.485
In reality,
"Marshall and Steph 4-eva"

16:32.487 --> 16:33.569
turned out to be

16:33.571 --> 16:35.405
"Marshall and Steph
for two days

16:35.407 --> 16:38.941
until Steph's boyfriend
got out of juvie a week early."

16:38.943 --> 16:41.610
Drives Lily crazy
when I wear it.

16:42.379 --> 16:45.081
I hope she's miserable
without me.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.387
Hey, Ted,
how's tricks?

16:51.389 --> 16:52.755
Tricks are pretty good, Lou.

16:52.757 --> 16:55.958
Had some girl trouble
earlier in the week, but, uh,

16:55.960 --> 16:58.060
I got a feeling from here on
out, things are gonna be A...

16:58.062 --> 17:00.563
O-Oh, you son of a bitch.

17:00.565 --> 17:02.932
Hello.

17:04.903 --> 17:06.269
Lily's right.

17:06.271 --> 17:07.603
I've been acting crazy.

17:07.605 --> 17:08.738
No, it's okay, bro.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.406
I mean, yeah,
you've been a little crazy,

17:11.409 --> 17:12.808
but it comes from love.

17:12.810 --> 17:14.911
It's the same kind of crazy
that makes a man

17:14.913 --> 17:18.164
offer his stripper girlfriend
over half a million dollars

17:18.165 --> 17:19.415
of government bailout money,

17:19.416 --> 17:21.200
not to rub up
on other guys' junk.

17:21.202 --> 17:22.651
It's good crazy.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.592
I hope Lily's okay.
Okay,

17:29.594 --> 17:30.826
you know, that's it, bro.

17:30.828 --> 17:32.661
We're both turning off
our phones for one hour.

17:32.663 --> 17:33.763
Motion denied.

17:33.765 --> 17:36.682
Okay, you leave me no choice.

17:36.684 --> 17:40.520
you give me one hour
of phone-free bro time,

17:40.522 --> 17:43.306
during which we,
and by we I mean you,

17:43.308 --> 17:46.309
get magnificently,
mythologically drunk.

17:46.311 --> 17:50.012
I'm talking needing-subtitles-
when-you-speak drunk.

17:50.014 --> 17:52.515
If you can give me that,

17:52.517 --> 17:55.651
I will wear this.

17:55.653 --> 17:56.736
The ducky tie?

17:56.738 --> 17:58.120
I thought you threw
that thing away.

17:58.122 --> 17:59.572
I did.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.524
It came back.

18:01.526 --> 18:03.192
All right, Barney,

18:03.194 --> 18:05.044
you got yourself a deal.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.083
Um, excuse me, miss.

18:11.085 --> 18:12.418
Um, when you get a chance,

18:12.420 --> 18:16.389
could you bring over a hundred
shots of tequila, please?

18:16.391 --> 18:17.990
I'll have the same.

18:22.546 --> 18:23.779
Why are you still here?

18:23.781 --> 18:25.398
Why do you think I'm still here?

18:25.400 --> 18:28.234
I guess because I'm
in love with you.

18:28.236 --> 18:31.554
Why else would I be seeing
your face everywhere I look?

18:31.556 --> 18:33.222
Because you feel bad.

18:33.224 --> 18:35.241
Of course I feel bad.

18:35.243 --> 18:37.059
I told you I love you,

18:37.061 --> 18:40.696
which is apparently the worst
thing you can say to someone.

18:40.698 --> 18:42.365
That's not why you feel bad.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.784
You feel bad because
after you said it,

18:44.786 --> 18:46.435
you let me go away.

18:47.538 --> 18:48.671
I know our relationship

18:48.673 --> 18:50.923
isn't exactly
what you want it to be,

18:50.925 --> 18:52.925
and I know I
may not love you

18:52.927 --> 18:56.913
the way you love me,
but I do love you.

18:58.482 --> 19:00.766
Isn't that worth hanging on to?

19:04.889 --> 19:08.391
I miss you.

19:08.393 --> 19:10.876
So go get me back.

19:17.468 --> 19:19.268
Robin?

19:19.270 --> 19:20.453
Ted.

19:20.455 --> 19:21.704
It's good to really see you.

19:21.706 --> 19:23.322
It's really good to see you.

19:23.324 --> 19:24.624
Look, I think we need to talk.

19:24.626 --> 19:26.993
Uh, me, too,
but now's not a good time.

19:26.995 --> 19:27.827
Why not?

19:27.829 --> 19:29.912
I am proud of you, bro.

19:29.914 --> 19:32.331
You turned off your phone
for one hour,

19:32.333 --> 19:33.749
and you got so drunk...

19:38.455 --> 19:40.423
Exactly.

19:41.224 --> 19:42.258
Hey,.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.593
Yes, Marshall?

19:46.180 --> 19:47.913
Well, I don't see why not.

19:50.017 --> 19:53.753
Whoa! I've got
17 new voicemails.

19:53.755 --> 19:55.104
Barney, it's Lily.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.406
You guys need to get back
to New York right away.

19:57.408 --> 19:58.474
I'm in labor.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.478
All hail Beercules!

20:02.480 --> 20:03.946
Yeah!

20:13.118 --> 20:16.353
All right, Barney,
you got yourself a deal.

20:20.592 --> 20:22.826
Hey, you've reached Marshall.

20:22.828 --> 20:24.377
Please leave a message.

20:24.379 --> 20:26.446
Hey, baby, it's me.

20:26.448 --> 20:27.981
I think I'm labor.

20:27.983 --> 20:31.801
We should do this
every weekend.

20:31.803 --> 20:34.020
Okay, this is real.

20:34.022 --> 20:35.188
It's not a false alarm.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.439
This is real; I'm in labor.

20:36.441 --> 20:38.775
I kind of need you
to call me back now.

20:38.777 --> 20:40.860
How does somebody so little

20:40.862 --> 20:44.597
have such strong fingers?

20:44.599 --> 20:45.865
Call me!

20:45.867 --> 20:48.785
He is the manager
of the Paramus Waldorf.

20:48.787 --> 20:52.539
You come to Paramus,
we will hook you up.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.491
If you're trying
to get back at me,

20:54.493 --> 20:58.398
you have chosen a wildly
inappropriate way of doing so!

20:58.949 --> 21:02.393
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah.

21:02.394 --> 21:06.394
