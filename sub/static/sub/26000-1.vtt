00:49.550 --> 00:50.818
- I'm so bored.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.897
All right.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.235
I'm gonna make some popcorn.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.923
There's something in the house.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.593
Yes, there's something
in the house.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.963
There's something in the house.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.032
Oh my gosh, please hurry!

05:07.274 --> 05:08.108
- Kayla!

05:09.677 --> 05:10.878
Get in the house!

05:10.878 --> 05:13.581
It's not in there,
it's out here!

06:08.902 --> 06:10.270
Holy shit!

08:13.894 --> 08:15.596
Your boyfriend's here.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.532
- Um, hey, will you tell him
I'll be there in a minute?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.233
I've gotta drop this
coffee off at table seven

08:20.233 --> 08:21.501
and then check in
on the kitchen.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
- I sure will, in a sec.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.081
- Oh, crap.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.116
- Is everything all
right here, sir?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.585
- Uh, actually no.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.119
My bacon wasn't crispy,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.486
my eggs were running
all over the place,

08:40.486 --> 08:42.455
and my toast is burned.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.558
- Well, your eggs
were scrambled.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.627
But it seems like you
ate a lot of it already.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.828
- Well, I struggled
with most of it,

08:47.828 --> 08:50.430
and I'm not satisfied at all.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.566
- How about I go get the kitchen
to make you another plate?

08:52.566 --> 08:53.500
How's that sound?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.434
- No, no!

08:54.434 --> 08:56.670
No, my stomach's upset now.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.673
- Hey Nick, Marilynn
is busy over there.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.708
But she'll be here in a minute.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.275
Can I get you anything?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.143
- Coffee.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.177
- Extra cream, right?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.212
- Yeah.
- Okay, got it.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.113
There we go.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.347
- Joan.
- Yeah?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.281
- Why's Lisa here today?

09:08.281 --> 09:09.216
Shouldn't she be at school?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.417
- Oh, she wasn't feeling well.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.119
And you know, on
such a short notice,

09:12.119 --> 09:14.487
there's no way she
could get a sitter.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.624
- I'm sorry, sir.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.458
Like I said, I'd be happy
to get you another plate.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.962
I said I
wanted crispy bacon!

09:23.563 --> 09:25.232
- Hi, Nick.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.900
- Lisa, how you doing?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.401
- I'm good.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.603
- Ah, you're good?

09:29.603 --> 09:30.904
I heard you were sick today.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.440
Oh, that's what I
meant.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.342
I'm not feeling so well.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.977
- Well, I hope you feel
a little bit better.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.612
Wouldn't want you
getting behind in school.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.147
- Can you keep a secret?

09:40.147 --> 09:41.514
- Of course.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.583
- Well, I'm not really sick.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.253
I just didn't wanna
go to school today.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.755
- Why didn't you wanna
go to school today?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.089
- Well, I told Marty Schulz

09:49.089 --> 09:50.958
that I wanted to
marry him someday.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.793
And he told all of his friends

09:52.793 --> 09:54.662
and they all laughed at me.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.163
- Lisa, you're in sixth grade.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.097
I think you're a
little too young

09:57.097 --> 09:58.565
to be worrying about marriage.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.935
- Oh silly, I meant in
high school or someday.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.837
- Well, I think
Marty'd be a lucky man

10:03.837 --> 10:05.338
to marry you at any age.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.007
- You really think so?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.308
- I'm sure of it.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.278
- Now, when will you
come to your senses?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.479
- Come into my senses?

10:12.479 --> 10:14.782
- When are you
gonna marry my mom?

10:14.782 --> 10:18.952
- I'd be better off if you
were better at your job.

10:21.121 --> 10:21.955
Oh, what's this?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.857
You called the Army in?

10:25.659 --> 10:28.195
What can I do for you, captain?

10:28.195 --> 10:30.898
- Is that any way
to talk to a lady?

10:30.898 --> 10:32.565
- Well, you know, I mean,
there'd be no problem here

10:32.565 --> 10:35.102
if they got my order right.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.503
- John, I get it.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.672
After they closed the mine,

10:38.672 --> 10:40.107
times have been
tough for everybody.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.442
But you can't be treating
people like this.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.510
- That's easy for you to say.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.678
You got a job.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.447
- Tell you what.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.252
- What's this for?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.353
- If you don't want
it, I'll take it back.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.222
- No, that's okay.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.124
I'm just asking what it's for.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.459
- Just like to help you out.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.463
Got a job opening, State Park.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.365
- A state job?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.667
That's a great job, man.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.303
That's better than shoveling
shit at Jacob's farm.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.372
- All right, the
pay's not that great.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.306
It's my old position.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.908
But at least it'd be a start.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.845
- Well, that's okay,
man, I need a job.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.880
Could you come in
for an interview Monday at 11?

11:19.880 --> 11:20.914
- Absolutely.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.883
My wife would be really happy.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.852
- One more thing.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.187
You've got to quit drinking.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.588
Can you do that?

11:28.588 --> 11:30.390
- Yeah, I can do that.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.892
- Can I have that?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.228
- You just asked me
to quit drinking.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.931
Now you want my flask
and you drink my alcohol?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.567
- I want your flask
so you don't drink it.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.401
- Oh.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.240
- All right.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.143
I'll see you Monday
at 11 o'clock.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.545
Make sure she gets a
good tip, all right?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.882
And don't forget, no drinking.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.849
You can do that?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.117
- Right, yeah, I can do that.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.653
All right,
see you Monday.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.289
- Starting tomorrow.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.660
Hi, Tom.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.096
- Hey, Joan, can I get
a cup of coffee, please?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.865
- Sure, I'll bring
it right over.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.346
- Oh, hello, Tom.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.848
- Hey John, how you doing?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
- I'm doing all right.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.853
- How about a little ride home?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.087
- I'd like that.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.655
- I'm ready when you are.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.190
- All right.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.460
- Joan, I'm gonna have to
cancel that coffee, okay?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.294
Thank you.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.401
- Howdy, babe.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.236
I know you are so busy.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.670
I'm sorry to stop in.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.006
But tonight, I got
something special planned.

12:53.006 --> 12:53.841
- Yeah?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.242
Six o'clock.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.109
- Okay.
- I'm picking you up.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.177
Put something nice on.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.278
I'll see you then.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.446
- Okay.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.648
- Right, I love you.
- Love you.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.823
How you doing there?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.758
- Fine, thanks.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.993
- Where you headed?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.761
- I was gonna go up
in the hills to camp.

13:14.761 --> 13:15.996
- Oh yeah.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.298
Well, there are plenty
of places to pick from.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.400
Looks like you got
perfect weather, too.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.902
- Sure is.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.303
- Well, you go and have
yourself a good time now,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.005
and be safe, okay?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.874
- All right, thank you.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.616
- I wanna live a metaphor life.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.785
You know, like I
read in that book.

13:38.785 --> 13:42.489
People say, "He lived
a life worth living."

13:42.489 --> 13:44.657
That's what I'm going for.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.829
And right there.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.766
Morning sun, man.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.035
This is where we get

13:55.035 --> 13:57.570
the National
Geographic-level finish, man.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.106
- Heck, yeah.

13:59.106 --> 14:03.010
I was here last week and
there were turkeys everywhere.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.045
- That's what I'm talking about.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.981
See, we don't have to
sell a documentary series.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.150
I don't need to be a star.

14:10.150 --> 14:14.254
We're the documentary, the
turkeys are right there.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.523
- I wanna be a
filmmaker and stuff.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.357
- Exactly.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.093
So we go slow, right?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.628
Stealth, whatnot.

14:21.628 --> 14:26.166
And then you utilize your
cinematographic expertise.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.068
- Like cinematic art.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.870
- I'm talking Smithsonian
Channel, brother.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.405
This ain't no Honey Boo Boo.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.468
- Goddammit!

16:09.502 --> 16:10.437
John Hicks.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.007
Oh hi, Honey, how you doing?

16:14.007 --> 16:14.841
Yeah.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.813
Look, you never mind about
that land and my brother, okay?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.783
My daddy said, "Do not
sell the land to anybody."

16:23.783 --> 16:24.851
I don't,

16:26.319 --> 16:27.154
Honey, I,

16:29.489 --> 16:33.326
listen,
wait a minute.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.162
I was down at Tammy's.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.434
Tammy's, the restaurant
down on Canal Street.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.735
Yes.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.805
Listen, the Ranger
came over to me

16:45.805 --> 16:48.007
and he told me that I
have a job interview

16:48.007 --> 16:50.710
at 10 o'clock on Monday.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.245
Yes.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.513
I am not drunk.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.485
Honey, look.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.428
Honey, look, honey.

17:10.896 --> 17:15.801
Whoa, Honey,

17:15.801 --> 17:18.070
yeah, breaking up.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.241
Yeah, oh,.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.685
Why'd she got to piss me off?

17:42.362 --> 17:43.796
Hey, who is that?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.715
- Hi.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.749
- Hi.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.185
- Are we still on for tonight?

18:38.185 --> 18:39.986
- Of course.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.088
- What time am I picking you up?

18:42.088 --> 18:42.922
- 7:30.

18:44.056 --> 18:44.891
- Nice.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.396
That's a real nice
color on you, too.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.230
- Thanks.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.500
- You're welcome.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.069
- So you're gonna
pick me up at my home?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.738
- Yeah, 'course.
- Okay.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.309
- Now, you gotta drive over
to the diner by yourself.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.415
- All right, so 7:30, okay?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.749
- Yeah, I'll pick
you up at your house.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.583
Okay.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.418
- All right, Sweetheart.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.252
- Bye.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.437
Woo-hoo, heck yeah!

19:30.437 --> 19:31.838
It's a damn clean shot.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.774
You boys
enjoying yourselves?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.175
Uh.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.878
- Yeah, guess you
could say that.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.179
- You guys do know
that shooting a deer

19:40.179 --> 19:43.216
outside of the season is
against the law, right?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.717
- Well, yeah, but,

19:46.553 --> 19:48.488
we didn't shoot this deer.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.323
This deer was dead
when we come upon it.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.591
Ain't that right, Ernest?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.592
- That's right,
Jeb, it was dead.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.126
We just walked right up on it.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.362
Yep.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.863
- All right, so you're
expecting me to believe

19:56.863 --> 19:59.266
that you guys were just
walking through the forest

19:59.266 --> 20:01.368
on this trail, with guns,

20:02.369 --> 20:04.671
and you came across a dead deer?

20:04.671 --> 20:05.938
- Yup, yes sir.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.941
That's quite a story.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.577
Well, you don't mind if I
check your guns, then, do you?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.579
Wait, don't you
need a warrant to do that?

20:12.579 --> 20:13.913
- Oh yeah, don't
you need a warrant?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.081
- A warrant?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.616
No, no, we're all good.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.351
Don't worry about it.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.390
All right, this gun is clean.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.492
Mind if I check this gun?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.366
Yeah, we got a problem, guys.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.372
Get back here.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.376
Why?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.711
Why would you run?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.212
- Scared, I guess.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.650
- That gun was fine.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.519
I don't think I need to ask,

20:52.519 --> 20:55.187
but who's the owner of this gun?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.590
- That'd be mine, sir.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.826
- Now, wasn't that
easier than lying?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.395
- Oh man, you're not gonna
give us a ticket, are you?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.297
- Don't you think
you deserve one?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.798
- Well, yeah, but,

21:08.100 --> 21:09.101
couldn't you give us a break?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.870
- Yeah, come on,
give us a break.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.238
- Did you give
this deer a break?

21:12.238 --> 21:13.239
- Yeah, right through the neck,

21:13.239 --> 21:14.073
can't you see that?

21:14.073 --> 21:15.575
- Shut up, Ernest.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.809
- All right, guys.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.711
You're catching me
in a very good mood,

21:18.711 --> 21:21.414
'cause I'm gonna be
proposing to my lady tonight.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.382
- Oh!

21:22.382 --> 21:24.083
Hey, well, congratulations.

21:24.083 --> 21:24.917
- Good luck, man.

21:24.917 --> 21:25.852
- Yeah, yeah.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.119
I'm sure she's gonna say yes.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.621
You're a good looking
man, don't you think?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.889
- What, you getting
queer on me or something?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.190
- No man, I'm just saying.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.224
- Whatever.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.593
- Anyway.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.761
I'm gonna let you guys off

21:34.761 --> 21:37.930
with just a warning
this one time.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.300
But I want you guys
to take this deer

21:41.300 --> 21:42.702
down to my truck.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.904
I'll take the guns, you grab--

21:44.904 --> 21:47.807
- You serious?
- Are you serious?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.676
- Do I look serious?

21:49.676 --> 21:50.510
Let's go.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.981
Could
we gut it first?

21:54.981 --> 21:56.549
- Does it look like we
have time to gut it?

21:56.549 --> 21:57.384
Let's go!

21:58.551 --> 21:59.819
- Shot it through the neck.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.654
What were you thinking?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.438
- Hey, who is that?

22:28.515 --> 22:29.949
Hey, who is that?

22:31.083 --> 22:34.654
You don't understand
who you're messing with!

22:36.088 --> 22:37.424
Hey, who keeps doing that?

22:37.424 --> 22:38.525
Cut that out!

22:41.428 --> 22:43.763
You know I'm gonna find you.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.267
Hey, come out here!

22:50.336 --> 22:51.404
Who's out there?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.172
Oh, the heck with it.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.079
You ain't supposed to be here.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.781
This is private land.

23:26.739 --> 23:30.076
Hey, you come out
from behind that tree.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.035
Wow.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.303
First class service.

24:31.303 --> 24:35.207
- I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean by that.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.342
- Car, silly.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.176
- Oh.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.147
Well, my real car
is in the shop,

24:41.147 --> 24:42.615
so it's gonna have to do.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.415
- That's okay.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.951
This is awesome.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.285
Can you turn the lights on?

24:46.285 --> 24:47.954
- Uh, for you I can.

24:48.888 --> 24:49.956
Boom.
- Whoop, whoop!

24:49.956 --> 24:51.190
- There you go.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.058
- That's awesome.
- Pretty cool, huh?

24:52.058 --> 24:53.025
You like that?

24:53.025 --> 24:54.460
- I like it.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.494
- Guess where I'm taking you.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.663
Where?

24:56.663 --> 24:57.930
- Just, we're going
to this place,

24:57.930 --> 25:00.032
they serve nothing but
caviar and champagne.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.400
- That's it?

25:01.400 --> 25:03.235
I have to work
after, I can't drink.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.938
- Okay, well, actually I'm
taking you to the diner.

25:05.938 --> 25:06.773
I was messing with you.

25:06.773 --> 25:07.674
Ooh, wow.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.877
- Is that okay?
- That's okay.

25:10.877 --> 25:11.844
- It's all right? All right.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.112
- Let's do it.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.513
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.150
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay, let's go.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.929
- Shit.

28:56.202 --> 29:00.406
- So, uh, Paula, I had
a really nice time.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.708
- I had a really
awesome time, Tom.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.844
- Really?
- Um-hm.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.346
- Is it something
you'd like to do again?

29:07.346 --> 29:08.447
- Of course.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.381
- Okay.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.317
Well, we definitely should then.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.318
- We should.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.034
Oh wow, I gotta be at
work in 15 minutes.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.135
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.136
- All right.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.773
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.607
- Okay.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.619
- Ma'am?

30:20.619 --> 30:21.720
Uh, you okay?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.192
- Did you see it?

30:26.192 --> 30:28.027
- Uh, see what, ma'am?

30:29.896 --> 30:33.065
- A big, hairy
creature or something.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.567
It just jumped up
in front of me.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.837
I swerved to miss it
and hit this tree.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.443
- Are you sure about that?

30:44.443 --> 30:45.611
- Yes, it was,

30:46.812 --> 30:49.982
it just jumped out
so fast that I, uh,

30:51.483 --> 30:53.652
didn't have time to react.

30:55.054 --> 30:59.325
- Uh, well, it was most likely
a deer, don't you think?

30:59.325 --> 31:01.793
- Sonny, I know what
a deer looks like,

31:01.793 --> 31:03.562
and this was no deer.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.798
It was ungodly big, huge.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.070
- Uh-huh.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.339
Ma'am, could you tell
me your name, please?

31:13.339 --> 31:14.173
- Oh yeah.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.641
My name is Lois Stevens.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.044
I live up the road from here.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.880
- I'm gonna need
to see your license

31:21.880 --> 31:23.815
and your proof of
insurance, please.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.184
I'm gonna call you an ambulance

31:25.184 --> 31:28.020
and probably most
likely a tow truck.

31:28.020 --> 31:32.191
If you could give me that
paperwork, I'd appreciate it.

31:36.528 --> 31:37.896
- You sit tight, okay?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.265
I'll be right back.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.766
Just sit there.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.001
Don't move too much 'cause
you might be injured, okay?

31:42.001 --> 31:44.070
I'm not allowed to
touch you or move you.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.371
- Thank you.

31:45.371 --> 31:48.574
- I'll be back couple
of minutes, sit tight.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.294
Dispatch, it's 239.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.996
I got a single car accident,

32:09.996 --> 32:14.400
license plate Frank, Nora,
Edward, five, one, nine, seven.

32:14.400 --> 32:19.105
I'm out on Route 28, about two
and a half miles south of 33.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.839
Looks like I'm gonna
need an ambulance

32:20.839 --> 32:23.242
and most likely a tow truck.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.743
Copy that?

32:24.743 --> 32:27.713
Okay, 239, we're on it.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.215
- Okay, copy that.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.961
Miss Stevens, hi.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.431
I'm gonna try and open the door,

32:45.431 --> 32:46.965
just give you a little bit more room, okay? Http://worldmkv.com/

32:46.965 --> 32:48.434
Looks like it's a little
jammed, so hang on.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.268
- Okay.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.709
You okay?

32:57.709 --> 32:58.610
- Uh, yeah.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.980
- The ambulance is
on its way, okay?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.782
I'm not really allows to
touch you or move you.

33:03.782 --> 33:07.219
But why don't we just
get back to, you know,

33:07.219 --> 33:08.387
what you were talking about,

33:08.387 --> 33:11.890
you telling me
about what you saw?

33:11.890 --> 33:16.895
- Uh, well, at first sight
I thought it was a person.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.565
But it was way too big for that.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.268
No way it was a man.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.503
Too big, huh?

33:24.503 --> 33:28.674
- It was huge and furry,
with long arms and very tall.

33:31.177 --> 33:35.347
It took maybe two or three
steps to cross the road.

33:37.015 --> 33:37.849
- Uh-hm.

33:42.288 --> 33:45.391
- Well, you do
believe me, don't you?

33:47.759 --> 33:51.063
- Oh yeah, no, of course I do.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.064
Oh.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.073
- Ambulance is
gonna be here soon.

34:01.073 --> 34:02.241
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.318
- Bear, quiet down.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.324
- Hey, why is Bear
barking, Tommy?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.025
- I don't know, Mom.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.428
What is it, Bear?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.632
Something out there, buddy?

34:39.178 --> 34:42.114
- Tommy, I got
another bag for you!

34:43.315 --> 34:45.516
Okay, Mom,
I'll be right there!

34:57.027 --> 34:58.029
Who's there?

35:04.170 --> 35:05.003
Man!

35:06.172 --> 35:07.739
What is that smell?

35:18.884 --> 35:19.718
- Tommy!

35:19.718 --> 35:21.253
Tommy, what is it?

35:21.253 --> 35:23.889
What?

35:23.889 --> 35:26.425
Tommy, where are you?

35:26.425 --> 35:29.161
Tommy, please come out.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.330
Oh my God, what was that?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.266
Oh my God!

35:37.002 --> 35:38.737
- 911, may I help you?

35:38.737 --> 35:41.006
- Yes, it's my son.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.508
He's been kidnapped.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.377
- Okay, ma'am, calm down
and tell me where you are.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.446
- I live at 1314
School Rod Road.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.181
Please send someone, hurry!

35:49.181 --> 35:50.649
- Okay, tell me what happened.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.351
- Oh, he was taking
out the garbage

35:52.351 --> 35:54.052
and I asked him to come
and get another bag,

35:54.052 --> 35:55.921
and he said okay and
the next thing I know,

35:55.921 --> 35:57.723
he's screaming for me.

35:57.723 --> 35:58.957
He's screaming my name, "Mom!"

35:58.957 --> 36:01.627
I go running out of the
house and I'm looking

36:01.627 --> 36:02.894
and I don't see him anywhere.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.763
I heard him calling for
me, started coming out,

36:04.763 --> 36:06.298
and all of a sudden
I see someone running

36:06.298 --> 36:08.834
really, really fast
through the woods.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.736
- Was it your son going
through the woods?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.438
- No, no, there's no way!

36:12.438 --> 36:13.572
It was going way too fast

36:13.572 --> 36:15.674
and he's only 12 years old.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.976
Please, please send
someone, hurry!

36:17.976 --> 36:20.479
Hurry, come and
help me get my son.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.447
- Okay, Mrs. Jones.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.881
I have a deputy nearby.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.451
- Okay, okay, send
him down please.

36:25.451 --> 36:26.852
Thank you, thank you so much.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.620
Please hurry!

36:28.620 --> 36:32.491
239 dispatch.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.426
- Yeah, dispatch, it's 239.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.427
We have a missing child

36:35.427 --> 36:37.829
over at 1314 School Rod Road.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.198
Is it possible for
you to check this out

36:40.198 --> 36:41.800
as soon as possible?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.035
- Well, I'm finishing up here
in about five, 10 minutes.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.004
So I can get there real
quick if you need me to.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.640
All right, thank you.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.641
- Copy that.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.291
- Ambulance is coming,
but here's my card.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.692
Wanna give it to you.

37:06.692 --> 37:07.626
If you have any questions,
you need anything,

37:07.626 --> 37:09.227
you just give me a call, okay?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.729
- Okay, all right.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.931
Ambulance
be here any second.

37:12.931 --> 37:13.932
You just hang tight, all right?

37:13.932 --> 37:15.701
- Thank you, officer.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.496
Help me, help me!

37:44.496 --> 37:46.865
Oh my God, it's my son.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.133
- What's the matter, ma'am?
- He's missing!

37:48.133 --> 37:49.401
My son is missing!

37:49.401 --> 37:50.636
- Okay, okay, calm
down, calm down.

37:50.636 --> 37:51.937
Step away from the
vehicle, please,

37:51.937 --> 37:53.104
so I can help you.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.940
Please,
please help me.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.042
- Talk to me, slow
down, calm down.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.176
Calm down, tell
me what happened.

37:58.176 --> 37:59.811
- He was taking out the trash.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.547
He was taking out the trash,

38:01.547 --> 38:03.048
and then he was
already out there,

38:03.048 --> 38:06.318
so I asked him, please just
take another bag for me.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.953
- All right, ma'am, show
me where this happened.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.855
- It was right over there.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.490
- Do you see it, can
you see the barrel?

38:11.490 --> 38:12.924
- Yeah, I can see it.
- He was right there.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.993
And then they was running
really fast right through there.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.463
It was something, I
know it was my son.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.798
- Okay.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.033
Was there anything that you
noticed that was unusual?

38:22.033 --> 38:23.201
- Just the dog.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.036
Our dog was barking
hysterically.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.505
And it wasn't like him at all.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.606
It was just odd.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.408
- Uh-uh, how so?

38:29.408 --> 38:31.877
- Well, like it was trying
to protect him or something.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.111
It was just really different.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.646
- Okay, okay.
- I don't know.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.647
- Okay, ma'am,
I'm gonna need you

38:35.647 --> 38:37.383
to just calm down, okay?

38:37.383 --> 38:39.985
I'm gonna go up there, I'm
gonna check it out, all right?

38:39.985 --> 38:41.520
- Okay.
- So stay right here.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.788
- Okay.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.857
Just, just please be careful.

38:45.857 --> 38:46.792
Be careful!

39:30.636 --> 39:31.970
Oh my God, damn!

39:33.405 --> 39:35.907
Shit.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.978
All right, ma'am.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.213
I did not see
anything out there.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.515
- Okay.
- Okay?

39:43.515 --> 39:44.783
But if something did happen,

39:44.783 --> 39:47.218
they probably went
in that direction.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.319
So
what are you saying?

39:48.319 --> 39:49.555
Are you saying
somebody kidnapped him?

39:49.555 --> 39:50.689
- No, no, no, no.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.459
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

39:53.459 --> 39:54.760
I'm gonna go over to my radio,

39:54.760 --> 39:56.595
I'm gonna call in
search and rescue team.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.029
They're gonna come down--
- Thank you.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.531
- And they're gonna
look for your son,

39:59.531 --> 40:01.232
see if they can find him, okay?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.068
This is what I want
you to do right now.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.804
No, stop, stop, don't talk.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.106
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

40:08.106 --> 40:10.742
We don't know anything
that happened, all right?

40:10.742 --> 40:12.410
Okay, so this is what
I need you to do.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.012
I'm gonna give you my card.
- Okay.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.080
- Okay?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.615
You have any
questions, you call me.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.949
But I need you to go in there,

40:17.949 --> 40:20.619
sit down, and wait until
search and rescue comes,

40:20.619 --> 40:22.420
'cause I'm gonna go, I'm
gonna call 'em in right now.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.222
- Thank you so much.
- Okay?

40:24.222 --> 40:25.791
Calm down, it'll be fine.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.593
We'll find your son,
everything's gonna be fine.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.694
I
just want him home.

40:28.694 --> 40:29.528
- Of course you do.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.829
I do, too, ma'am.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.430
Go in there and
sit down, darlin'.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.431
- Thank you so much.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.399
- I'm gonna call
it in right now.

40:34.399 --> 40:38.069
Okay.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.636
Hey Paul, will
you check this out for me?

41:10.636 --> 41:12.470
What you got?

41:13.905 --> 41:16.508
I found it about an
hour ago at a crime scene.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.976
Mrs. Jones' boy.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.244
- This is ripe.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.848
Well, it's not canine.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.885
There's pieces of hide here.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.454
- Can you just give me a second?

41:29.454 --> 41:30.689
I gotta talk to dispatch.

41:30.689 --> 41:31.990
Yeah,
I'll be right here.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.892
Okay.

41:43.735 --> 41:46.071
- Camera right there.
- Okay.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.708
Man, this is it.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.176
- Don't get any
better than that.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.310
- Hey, check, it's
a turkey call.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.112
Turkey call, no turkey call?

41:54.112 --> 41:57.683
Yeah? Meh, I'll give
it to you later.

42:02.020 --> 42:02.854
Lookin'.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.491
We need a flashlight.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.698
- What the hell?

42:15.300 --> 42:17.202
Brian, Brian, you
gotta see this.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.436
Hold on, man.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.370
I gotta find my, my
other flashlight--

42:19.370 --> 42:21.306
- No, no, you gotta see this.

42:21.306 --> 42:22.608
- What?

42:22.608 --> 42:23.675
Look!

42:24.943 --> 42:25.777
- Oh shit.

42:29.247 --> 42:32.417
That's like a big-ass
bear or something.

42:32.417 --> 42:35.286
- That ain't no freaking bear.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.454
It's got arms!

42:39.490 --> 42:40.859
It's a Sasquatch.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.193
- Goddammit, man!

42:42.193 --> 42:43.662
I'm on meds and I drink!

42:43.662 --> 42:46.231
Not funny, I don't believe you!

42:51.436 --> 42:52.270
He's,
http://worldmkv.com/

42:54.205 --> 42:55.206
it's moving,

42:56.107 --> 42:57.843
it's moving this way.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.880
Uh.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.714
No, no.

43:04.149 --> 43:05.283
It's running this way.

43:05.283 --> 43:06.752
- Oh shit, man!

43:17.028 --> 43:19.698
- Man, this is gonna be
historical damn footage!

43:19.698 --> 43:21.967
- Come on, let's--
- Okay, okay, okay.

43:28.573 --> 43:29.741
Damn, no signal.

43:29.741 --> 43:30.909
Damn Obamaphone!

43:30.909 --> 43:32.043
- Who the hell are you calling?

43:32.043 --> 43:32.978
- I'm gonna call Bobby.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.212
He knows the park ranger.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.013
- Run, we gotta
get to the truck!

43:36.014 --> 43:37.382
- This way!
- This way.

43:37.382 --> 43:39.484
- Faster, faster!
- I am, I am.

43:39.484 --> 43:41.887
- My back is killing me, man!

43:59.871 --> 44:02.373
I got a signal, I got a signal.

44:20.826 --> 44:21.659
- Hello?

44:22.761 --> 44:25.396
- Hey Bob, how you doin'?

44:25.396 --> 44:26.464
- Hey, Brian.

44:28.066 --> 44:29.400
Uh, how are you?

44:31.236 --> 44:32.704
- I'm doing fine, Bob.

44:32.704 --> 44:34.372
Hey, I just need the number
for that park ranger guy

44:34.372 --> 44:36.041
that you know.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.108
- Ranger Nick.

44:37.108 --> 44:40.345
Why are you gonna bother him?

44:40.345 --> 44:42.513
- Well, don't worry
about it, Bob.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.083
I just, me and Duane were
out filming some turkeys

44:45.083 --> 44:48.987
and we seen ourselves
a straight up Bigfoot.

44:48.987 --> 44:49.988
- A Bigfoot?

44:49.988 --> 44:51.322
Yeah, okay.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.324
- Yeah, we got the
shit on video, okay?

44:53.324 --> 44:55.193
So ha ha, Bob.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.395
- Yeah, oh yeah, I see Bigfoots

44:57.395 --> 44:59.330
out in my back
yard all the time,

44:59.330 --> 45:03.001
like seven feet tall
some of them are.

45:03.001 --> 45:07.538
- Oh yeah, you ever seen
a nine-foot, jackass?

45:07.538 --> 45:11.476
Yeah, okay, um.

45:11.476 --> 45:14.479
So here's his number,
it's 555-7634.

45:17.916 --> 45:21.719
Don't tell him I
gave you this number.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.121
- We'll try, Bob.

45:23.121 --> 45:23.955
Thanks.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.760
- He tried to call
bullshit on you, didn't he?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.028
- Yeah.

45:30.028 --> 45:31.562
He was laughing until I
told him how big it was.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.563
Son of a bitch.

45:33.698 --> 45:35.967
- So what do you got, Paul?

45:38.736 --> 45:41.072
- Well, I can see what it's not.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.508
It's not bear, it's not boar.

45:45.110 --> 45:47.612
And it's not really a primate.

45:49.047 --> 45:51.582
Whatever it is, it
gashed itself pretty good

45:51.582 --> 45:54.652
because there's
traces of blood here.

45:56.287 --> 45:57.122
- Look.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.358
I gotta tell you something,

46:00.358 --> 46:04.229
but you gotta promise to
keep it private, okay?

46:04.229 --> 46:07.098
A few hours ago,
I was investigating an accident, right?

46:07.098 --> 46:09.434
A woman had wrecked her car.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.836
And get this.

46:10.836 --> 46:14.072
She told me the reason
why she wrecked was

46:14.072 --> 46:18.243
because a big, hairy creature
jumped in front of her car.

46:20.879 --> 46:21.712
- And?

46:23.915 --> 46:25.616
- I didn't think much of it.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.918
I thought she was kind of nuts.

46:26.918 --> 46:28.987
So I got in my car,
I was going over

46:28.987 --> 46:30.956
and checking another
scene, you know,

46:30.956 --> 46:32.590
the missing Jones boy,

46:32.590 --> 46:33.424
and, uh,

46:35.660 --> 46:36.727
I saw it too.

46:39.831 --> 46:42.100
Gotta understand something.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.801
This thing was huge.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.471
Okay, it was enormous.

46:46.471 --> 46:49.607
It were covered in hair,
too, like wool or something,

46:49.607 --> 46:52.643
it jumped right out
in front of my car.

46:52.643 --> 46:55.646
And it took off at
tremendous speed.

46:56.848 --> 46:59.584
- And you found this
sample in that area?

46:59.584 --> 47:01.086
- Yeah!

47:01.086 --> 47:05.023
Listen, Paul, I know what
I saw, okay, I know it.

47:06.391 --> 47:10.561
I know it sounds totally
crazy, like,

47:11.629 --> 47:13.564
I can't even believe it myself.

47:13.564 --> 47:17.468
But I think we may have
a Bigfoot on our hands.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.905
Or something like it.

47:19.905 --> 47:20.805
- We might.

47:22.007 --> 47:24.009
You know, I have an
old friend of mine,

47:24.009 --> 47:28.579
was very experienced in
incidences like this.

47:28.579 --> 47:31.149
He knows what that smell means.

47:33.484 --> 47:35.086
- Okay, great, could
you call him even now?

47:35.086 --> 47:38.023
- He lives about
100 miles from here.

47:38.023 --> 47:39.457
He'll be here in an hour

47:39.457 --> 47:42.793
when I call him with
this information.

47:42.793 --> 47:45.363
We just have to keep
it on the down low.

47:45.363 --> 47:46.297
- No doubt.

47:48.266 --> 47:52.503
- I'll get right on it.
- Okay, thanks, buddy.

47:55.907 --> 47:57.475
- Ranger Nick Thomas.

47:57.475 --> 48:00.045
- Hey, hi, my name
is Brian Johnson.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.080
I'm a friend of Bob Wilkes.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.983
How is
old Bob nowadays?

48:04.983 --> 48:06.184
- Oh, he's doing fine, sir.

48:06.184 --> 48:07.852
Hey, listen, the reason
why I'm calling is,

48:07.852 --> 48:10.855
me and my partner, we see a
really, really weird thing

48:10.855 --> 48:13.791
up on the, in the Hawking
Hills area this morning.

48:13.791 --> 48:14.625
- Okay.

48:15.593 --> 48:18.496
What exactly did you see?

48:18.496 --> 48:20.798
- Well, I'm just gonna give
it to you straight, ranger.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.300
We seen a Bigfoot.

48:23.634 --> 48:25.303
- A Bigfoot?

48:25.303 --> 48:27.172
- It might sound a little crazy.

48:27.172 --> 48:30.175
But the fact is,
we got it on video.

48:31.209 --> 48:33.878
Me and my partner Duane have it.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.714
- All right, first things first.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.816
Where exactly did you see this?

48:38.816 --> 48:42.920
It's only about a mile
up on Happy Hollow Road.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.422
- Okay.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.224
You know, I'm actually not
that far from that spot.

48:46.224 --> 48:47.825
How about you meet me
at the intersection

48:47.825 --> 48:52.563
of 56 and Happy Hollow Road
in, say, 15, 20 minutes?

48:52.563 --> 48:54.165
- You've got it, man.

48:54.165 --> 48:57.002
- All right, I
will see you there.

49:02.307 --> 49:03.241
- Boom!

49:05.143 --> 49:06.144
Very dangerous, very dangerous.

49:06.144 --> 49:07.778
Drive, drive without passing.

49:07.778 --> 49:08.679
Please, go.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.233
- Hey, thanks for
meeting me, guys.

49:28.233 --> 49:29.434
Ranger Nick Thomas.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.102
- How ya doing, man?

49:31.102 --> 49:32.037
- Duane.

49:32.037 --> 49:33.838
- So, uh, area's right up there.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.006
Are you ready to go?

49:35.006 --> 49:36.674
- Yeah, let's do it.

49:44.215 --> 49:45.050
Who, uh,

49:48.019 --> 49:50.155
we're not gonna
need those, are we?

49:50.155 --> 49:54.292
- When you see the size of
this thing, you'll understand.

49:54.292 --> 49:57.262
- Okay, well, why don't
you show me the footage

49:57.262 --> 49:58.529
and then I'll understand.

49:58.529 --> 49:59.997
- Well, we kinda
figured it'd be best

49:59.997 --> 50:02.100
to take you to the actual place.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.402
That way you can get
an idea how big it is.

50:04.402 --> 50:05.436
- All right, fair enough.

50:05.436 --> 50:06.271
Let's go.

50:12.277 --> 50:13.711
All right, so which
one of these trails

50:13.711 --> 50:15.180
are we gonna be taking here?

50:15.180 --> 50:16.614
- Well, we ain't going that way,

50:16.614 --> 50:18.216
'cause that's where
the Bigfoot went.

50:18.216 --> 50:19.417
We'll go up this way.

50:19.417 --> 50:20.718
- Sure, boss, come on.

50:20.718 --> 50:22.387
After you.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.829
- You guys ever hunted
in this area before?

50:31.829 --> 50:33.064
- Yeah, I have.

50:34.399 --> 50:35.866
- Who owns this land?

50:35.866 --> 50:37.435
- Old man Turner.

50:37.435 --> 50:39.204
He's my dad's friend.

51:13.238 --> 51:14.139
This is it.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.342
- This is where you saw it?

51:17.342 --> 51:18.676
- Yep, this is it.

51:18.676 --> 51:19.844
Tell him, Duane.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.579
- Well, we were
setting up right here,

51:21.579 --> 51:23.914
and he was right down there.

51:26.484 --> 51:28.186
- Can I see the footage now?

51:28.186 --> 51:29.187
- Well, sure.

51:29.187 --> 51:30.087
- Go ahead.

51:34.559 --> 51:36.394
- All right.

51:36.394 --> 51:37.695
That's the trigger right there?

51:37.695 --> 51:38.863
- Right there.

51:40.465 --> 51:41.766
- Oh my God.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.168
That thing is huge!

51:43.168 --> 51:44.435
- Thank you.

51:44.435 --> 51:47.238
No, it's
monstrous huge.

51:48.573 --> 51:51.008
- Let's go down to that tree.

51:52.310 --> 51:55.313
- All right, I guess
I'm not scared.

51:58.649 --> 51:59.984
- I mean, look at this.

51:59.984 --> 52:01.852
Its arms are lower
than its knees.

52:01.852 --> 52:03.554
This thing is not human.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.556
- It's all right there, bro.

52:05.556 --> 52:09.527
- All right, I'm
looking at this tree.

52:09.527 --> 52:14.432
If we're at standing, this
thing's almost nine feet tall.

52:14.432 --> 52:15.266
- So who do we call?

52:15.266 --> 52:16.767
CNN? Ghostbusters?

52:19.970 --> 52:21.506
- Let's take it easy here, man.

52:21.506 --> 52:22.740
This is huge.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.242
- Life is different
from hereon out, bro.

52:24.242 --> 52:26.644
It's like alien contact.

52:26.644 --> 52:29.146
- So it started
walking this way.

52:29.146 --> 52:32.450
It's a good thing we
got out of here when we did.

52:32.450 --> 52:34.419
- It was definitely
heading in your direction.

52:34.419 --> 52:37.988
- So you had sightings like
this reported before, huh?

52:37.988 --> 52:39.824
- Yeah, all the time.

52:39.824 --> 52:42.227
But it's normally pretty hokey.

52:42.227 --> 52:43.661
This is different.

52:43.661 --> 52:44.995
We've got proof.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.665
This is incredible.

52:47.665 --> 52:50.435
- So much for turkey
hunting videos, huh?

52:50.435 --> 52:51.736
- Francis Coppola says

52:51.736 --> 52:53.971
film is a series of
brilliant accidents.

52:53.971 --> 52:56.040
- Accidents, whatever,
brilliant or not,

52:56.040 --> 52:58.008
you guys, this thing
does look aggressive.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.944
I'm just, I'm glad
nobody got hurt.

53:00.878 --> 53:02.146
- Holy shit, did you hear that?

53:02.146 --> 53:03.514
- Hold on, you guys,
just hold on a sec.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.982
Don't go shooting.

53:04.982 --> 53:05.816
That brush is thick.

53:05.816 --> 53:07.385
Just everybody relax.

53:07.385 --> 53:08.219
- Oh, oh!

53:09.119 --> 53:10.355
Son of a bitch!

53:11.922 --> 53:13.758
I hear that.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.995
- Whoa, wait a minute.

53:17.995 --> 53:21.031
Oh, you guys, look at this.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.032
Wow.

53:22.032 --> 53:25.303
- You know, that
is a foot print.

53:25.303 --> 53:28.873
About 20 inches
long, 10 inches wide.

53:28.873 --> 53:31.141
- I thought I had big feet.

53:33.177 --> 53:34.612
- Yeah, the more
I think about it,

53:34.612 --> 53:36.914
I'm convinced this
thing is dangerous.

53:36.914 --> 53:38.082
We should get out of here.

53:38.082 --> 53:39.250
I got a couple
calls I gotta make.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.286
Heck, yeah.

53:41.286 --> 53:42.820
- Brian, are you comfortable
with me holding on

53:42.820 --> 53:45.022
to this footage
for a little bit?

53:45.022 --> 53:46.457
- Tell you what, man.

53:46.457 --> 53:49.093
I'm gonna keep the original,
I'll give you a copy.

53:49.093 --> 53:50.628
- Okay, but seriously, you guys,

53:50.628 --> 53:52.162
we gotta keep this on lockdown.

53:52.162 --> 53:54.432
Don't be putting it on TMZ,
don't go on YouTube with it.

53:54.432 --> 53:56.267
- No, man, I'm
calling Gloria Allred.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.968
This shit's serious.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.806
- Yeah, this is my
retirement, man.

54:01.806 --> 54:03.207
- Let's go, guys.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.981
- There's no birthday
party for me here.

54:10.981 --> 54:12.783
- Hey, I'm glad you could come.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.319
- Hey, good to see you, man.

54:14.319 --> 54:15.386
How you doing?

54:15.386 --> 54:16.186
- Well.

54:19.357 --> 54:20.991
This is very fresh,

54:20.991 --> 54:22.327
like last night.

54:23.528 --> 54:24.895
Ho!

54:24.895 --> 54:25.730
- Yeah.

54:27.365 --> 54:28.366
- Where'd you get this?

54:28.366 --> 54:29.300
- Tom found it.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.702
Let me see if he's still here.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.577
- Tired of sitting in my
chair, like, flipping buggers,

54:39.577 --> 54:40.511
you know what I mean?

54:40.511 --> 54:41.746
I'm hip with that.

54:41.746 --> 54:43.481
- My future's bright!

54:44.482 --> 54:45.550
- Boom!
- Yes!

54:47.718 --> 54:49.720
Come to this
goddamn door, Duane!

54:49.720 --> 54:51.489
Open it or I'll beat your ass!

54:51.489 --> 54:52.790
- I don't have to take that.

54:53.724 --> 54:54.792
Open this door!

54:54.792 --> 54:55.726
- I'm busy.

54:57.094 --> 54:59.664
I don't care if
you're walking on the damn moon!

54:59.664 --> 55:01.699
I need my smokes and
my lady products.

55:01.699 --> 55:03.901
- You ain't gonna believe
what's about to happen, Betty!

55:03.901 --> 55:05.470
Shut the
fuck up, Brian!

55:05.470 --> 55:07.237
- You better pack for L.A.

55:07.237 --> 55:09.874
Duane,
I'm warning you.

55:09.874 --> 55:12.610
- I hear you, Baby, I hear you.

55:12.610 --> 55:13.878
- You'll see, Betty.

55:13.878 --> 55:15.279
Shut up, crack head.

55:15.279 --> 55:16.714
- Hey, I'm sober.

55:18.716 --> 55:20.351
I might drink a beer
every now and then,

55:20.351 --> 55:22.887
snort a little
Klonopin, but not like,

55:22.887 --> 55:26.524
you know,.

55:26.524 --> 55:27.892
- And here we go.

55:27.892 --> 55:29.727
- Yes, yes! All right.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.563
We got the original in--

55:32.563 --> 55:33.798
- The place.

55:33.798 --> 55:36.033
- The place, hell yeah,
full Shawshank, bitch.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.167
Worst case scenario?

55:37.167 --> 55:38.903
- We meet in the place.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.371
Yes!

55:40.371 --> 55:41.205
- Okay.

55:42.507 --> 55:43.708
- Follow me.
- I'll follow you.

55:43.708 --> 55:44.942
Listen, we'll get my truck

55:44.942 --> 55:46.143
at the end of the driveway.

55:46.143 --> 55:47.211
You got the camera.

55:47.211 --> 55:48.746
- I got the.

55:48.746 --> 55:52.216
- Before we go out, you look
right, I'm gonna look left.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.088
I think we're safe.

55:58.088 --> 55:59.256
- Let's do it.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.463
- I see you, motherfuckers!

56:05.463 --> 56:07.498
She's a
scary son of a bitch!

56:07.498 --> 56:09.400
She scares me more than Bigfoot.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.902
You ain't
married to her!

56:11.902 --> 56:13.538
God, I love this shit.

56:13.538 --> 56:14.872
I'm so in my fricking element.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.106
- I hear ya.

56:16.106 --> 56:16.941
Who needs drugs?

56:16.941 --> 56:17.875
- Yeah.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.176
Crack is whack.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.177
- Holy shit, look out!

56:28.118 --> 56:29.053
Grab your shotgun.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.287
- Doggone, I got no shotgun.

56:30.287 --> 56:33.491
It's behind
your seat, you fool.

56:33.491 --> 56:34.925
Shoot that bitch!

56:39.497 --> 56:41.398
- It, it's gone.

56:41.398 --> 56:44.101
Shit, it's gone.

56:44.101 --> 56:46.571
Thing's a hairy ghost, man.

56:46.571 --> 56:47.738
- Why don't we,

56:47.738 --> 56:49.640
we take the long way into town?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.908
I heard that.

56:50.908 --> 56:53.343
I'll turn this thing around.

56:53.343 --> 56:54.645
- All right, I basically just

56:54.645 --> 56:57.347
moved the reservation
back an hour.

56:57.347 --> 56:59.550
No, everything, no,
everything's fine.

56:59.550 --> 57:01.986
No, I appreciate you
being so flexible.

57:01.986 --> 57:03.754
Um, you know what?

57:03.754 --> 57:05.723
I gotta get going here.

57:05.723 --> 57:08.493
No, tonight's gonna be awesome.

57:08.493 --> 57:09.560
All right, I love you, too.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.828
Bye.

57:10.828 --> 57:13.531
Ooh, shit is
getting thick, ranger.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.499
- Why, what happened?

57:14.499 --> 57:15.966
Did somebody contact you?

57:15.966 --> 57:17.535
- Somebody needs to call
the fucking Air Force, man!

57:17.535 --> 57:19.604
- We saw the thing again.

57:19.604 --> 57:21.338
And we think the
thing is chasing us.

57:21.338 --> 57:23.608
- All right, calm down,
everybody just calm down.

57:23.608 --> 57:24.441
Where's the video?

57:24.441 --> 57:25.275
Do you have it?

57:25.275 --> 57:26.644
- Go ahead, Duane.

57:26.644 --> 57:27.912
Take the whole camera, man.

57:27.912 --> 57:29.146
Analyze it all you want.

57:29.146 --> 57:31.381
We got the original
copy sequestered.

57:31.381 --> 57:33.751
So anybody starts any
shit about who owns what,

57:33.751 --> 57:35.419
everybody can suck my ass.

57:35.419 --> 57:37.287
- We'll see you in court.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.323
- Um, this is a digital chip.

57:39.323 --> 57:40.758
- So what?

57:40.758 --> 57:42.527
It ain't the golden chalice,
brother, don't worry.

57:42.527 --> 57:43.961
- Uh, my point is,
it doesn't matter

57:43.961 --> 57:45.229
where you hid the original.

57:45.229 --> 57:46.731
That's not how the
technology works.

57:46.731 --> 57:48.198
- You know what, ranger?

57:48.198 --> 57:50.501
This whole thing is frankly
fucking above you, dude.

57:50.501 --> 57:52.402
We should have gone
straight to the damn FBI.

57:52.402 --> 57:54.038
I mean, come on,
you wear shorts.

57:54.038 --> 57:55.139
- I was in the Army
for five years.

57:55.139 --> 57:56.240
I could kick your ass.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.542
- Well, wrong on me, then.

57:57.542 --> 57:59.409
I was a drug addict
and I could not serve.

57:59.409 --> 58:01.879
One day, guys.

58:01.879 --> 58:03.814
All I'm asking for is one day.

58:03.814 --> 58:04.649
I just don't want
the whole county

58:04.649 --> 58:05.750
going up in hysteria.

58:05.750 --> 58:07.217
You know, after that, you can do

58:07.217 --> 58:08.385
whatever you want
with the footage.

58:08.385 --> 58:09.319
- Yeah, well, what
about the son of a bitch

58:09.319 --> 58:10.588
that's chasing me right now?

58:10.588 --> 58:11.956
- Us.

58:11.956 --> 58:14.324
- You guys, I gotta get
some work done here.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.160
- I must be speaking
in gibberish.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.462
- The thing is out there, man.

58:18.462 --> 58:21.532
- All right, we need to do
things one step at a time.

58:22.767 --> 58:24.669
Right now, the step
I need you to take

58:24.669 --> 58:26.571
is to please leave.

58:26.571 --> 58:27.738
- Yeah, right.

58:28.739 --> 58:30.207
- Out.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.386
- I'm Joe Hicks.

58:42.386 --> 58:43.187
I'm here to pick
up the survey maps

58:43.187 --> 58:44.488
for the Hicks estate.

58:44.488 --> 58:46.924
- Are you John Hicks' brother?

58:46.924 --> 58:47.758
- Yeah.

58:57.301 --> 58:59.604
- Police department,
may I help you?

58:59.604 --> 59:01.038
- Hello, officer.

59:01.038 --> 59:04.108
Yeah, this is Ranger Nick Thomas
from Lake National Forest.

59:04.108 --> 59:06.543
I, uh, I think we've
got a problem here.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.279
- Okay, what might
your problem be, sir?

59:09.279 --> 59:12.016
- Well, I got a call earlier
from a few turkey hunters,

59:12.016 --> 59:14.151
and they've got
some video footage

59:14.151 --> 59:17.087
of what they think
to be a Bigfoot.

59:18.522 --> 59:20.591
- Really, a Bigfoot?

59:20.591 --> 59:24.829
First off, Mr. Thomas, isn't
it, say, a little crazy?

59:24.829 --> 59:26.330
- Well, consider
this a curtesy call

59:26.330 --> 59:28.565
because I do believe that
this thing is aggressive

59:28.565 --> 59:30.300
and it's in the area.

59:30.300 --> 59:33.170
- Now, did you see this Bigfoot,

59:33.170 --> 59:36.774
or did some cracked out
crack head tell you about it?

59:36.774 --> 59:38.676
- Sir, I think you should
be taking this call

59:38.676 --> 59:40.711
a little bit more seriously.

59:40.711 --> 59:42.647
- Oh yeah, why is
that, Mr. Ranger?

59:42.647 --> 59:44.815
You gonna call my Chief?

59:44.815 --> 59:46.917
- Hey Paul, you
needed to see me?

59:46.917 --> 59:50.187
- Oh, Tom, this is the friend
I was telling you about,

59:50.187 --> 59:52.690
the expert in the field.

59:52.690 --> 59:53.724
- Tom Benson.

59:53.724 --> 59:55.292
- Hank Fletcher, good to see ya.

59:55.292 --> 59:56.293
So you're the one
that saw this, huh?

59:56.293 --> 59:57.527
- Yes, sir.

59:57.527 --> 59:58.929
- Why don't you
tell me about it?

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.932
Uh, well,

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.770
I was investigating a woman
who drove off the road.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.004
So I thought drunk driving.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:09.606
But now, she drove off the road

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:13.644
because she saw a
giant hairy Bigfoot.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.815
- Because we don't know
what this thing is,

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:20.584
what it's capable of
doing, or what it wants.

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.119
- Answer me this.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:25.155
How do you know that it is
not someone in a costume?

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.959
- It's too damn big to
be a guy in a costume.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.561
- It's just down here,
follow me, please.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.797
I wanna thank you, first of all,

01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:33.831
for coming in on
such short notice.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.499
- No, it's my pleasure.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:36.834
I'm excited about this.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.936
You instituted a?

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.637
Yeah.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.906
- Yeah, so the first location

01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:43.340
I wanna take you
to is real close.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.775
- Good, sooner the better.

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.343
- Okay, enough is enough!

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.378
No more of this Bigfoot crap!

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.213
- Excuse me.

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:50.748
Sergeant.

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:52.482
Who're you talking to?

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.685
- It's only a park ranger
who claims, get this,

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:57.487
there's a Bigfoot on
the loose.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.923
- Give me that phone, please.

01:00:58.923 --> 01:00:59.824
Gimme that!

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.093
This is Detective
Benson, who is this?

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.528
Uh-huh.

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:06.797
Okay, hang on, slow
down, slow down.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.198
Where are you?

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.033
Uh-huh.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.968
I know exactly where that is.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.636
Can you stay put for 15 minutes?

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:14.304
I'll be right there.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:18.308
You're getting on my bad side.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.684
Are we still
picking everyone else up?

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.553
No, we're just
gonna meet them there.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.988
You're gonna
love this place, Claudia.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.857
There are so many
cute boys there.

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:34.058
Frankie, Steph said

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:35.192
you're hooking me up

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.226
with one of your
friends, though, right?

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:37.461
Wait, what, Steph?

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:38.996
Yeah,
I hooked her up.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.298
Come on, Frankie,
you hook Susan up and not me?

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.699
I love you, too.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.934
Sorry, Claudia,
but there's gonna be

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:45.202
other guys there,
don't worry about it.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.005
Yeah,
you better hope so.

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:07.391
- What the hell is this?

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.394
What the?

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:18.368
- Looks like someone drug
it here or something.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:20.370
Yeah, it does.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:28.913
- Hey.

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:29.847
- Shit.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.248
- Sorry.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.283
- Was just looking at
what you're looking at.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:34.518
- I don't know.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:38.588
It's fine, I just don't
get why I'm so jumpy.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.723
- What's up, guys?

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:40.858
- Just looking around.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:42.092
We should help.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.861
- Yeah, we need help
moving this tree.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:45.229
Okay.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.833
- You guys hear that?

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:50.434
- Yeah, I heard it.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.539
- Damn, dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:56.974
- What are you all doing?

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.843
- We heard a noise and
we're checking it out.

01:02:58.843 --> 01:03:02.947
- Oh man, let's just move
this tree and get out of here.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.057
What's up, guys?!

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:14.825
- Oh my God!

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:15.725
- You scared the shit out of me.

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.829
- Sorry, bro, just having fun.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:19.997
Yeah, funny.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.398
- It's good to see you, man.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:22.967
- Yeah, you too.

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.468
You put this tree here?

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:27.404
- Yeah, had to get you to
stop somehow, didn't I?

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:28.605
- All right, can
we please move this

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:30.107
and just get out of here?

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:34.078
All
right, you're the boss.

01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:41.551
One, two, three, now.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:55.465
- Thanks for meeting me, guys.

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:56.733
Ranger Nick Thomas.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.202
- Tom Benson, this
is Hank Fletcher.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.303
- It's nice to meet you.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.704
What do you got?

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:01.939
- All right, well,
earlier today I got a call

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:03.040
from a couple turkey hunters

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.808
out in the Hawking Hills area.

01:04:04.808 --> 01:04:06.510
Now they're doing
a documentary film,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.680
and they came across what
they believe to be a Bigfoot.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.449
So I went out, checked
everything out,

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.351
and saw the location
of the sighting.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.387
And get this, they got a video.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.523
- Where can we see this video?

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:20.424
- Got it right in the truck.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:21.258
Let's go.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:25.896
- God, look at the
size of that thing.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.164
It's gotta be eight feet.

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:29.299
- Nine, and a beauty.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:31.135
- Yeah, I was right
there at that tree.

01:04:31.135 --> 01:04:32.736
We're looking at nine feet.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:36.173
There's also a footprint
about 20 inches long.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.542
- I say we go check out
the footprint right now.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.077
- Nick, you tell anybody else?

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:43.447
- No, just called your office
and talked to Sergeant Moody.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.848
- Oh God, what'd he say?

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:47.584
More like
Sergeant Asshole.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.420
Told me I was crazy, said the
guys are probably on drugs.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.721
Very unprofessional.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.690
- He's not exactly
Mr. Popularity.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.759
The other day I was dealing
with a missing child case--

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:57.427
- Wait, wait.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.196
You say there's a missing child?

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:00.965
- Yeah, what about it?

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.202
- This is just a
hunch, all right?

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.904
But just maybe this missing kid

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.906
and our Sasquatch are connected.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.441
- How do you figure?

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:14.478
Humans and primates
share 96 % of their DNA code.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:16.446
It's the most of
any other mammal.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:18.648
There been actual cases
where human children

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.750
have been raised by primates.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.753
Most recently, the
feral child of Borneo

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.490
and the Nigerian chimp boy.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.258
Maybe the Sasquatch
abducted this kid

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:31.128
to raise it as one of
their own for some reason.

01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:32.862
I don't know, but
it's just a guess.

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.265
And I say we should
go check the area.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.666
- Well, now, search and
rescue is still there,

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.135
searching for the kid.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.369
- Great.

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:41.138
If it did take him,
maybe we'll find him.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:43.940
- Let's take my truck, just
in case we got to off road.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.110
- I'll get a couple of
walkies and a shotgun.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:47.844
- All right, pilgrim.

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:10.067
- Hey.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.736
- I'm glad to see you
made it, little brother.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.871
- Hey, how you doing?

01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:16.206
- Another day in paradise.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:19.176
You still
like Rambo up here?

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:21.778
- Always running
your mouth, smartass.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:24.714
But yeah, little
bit of Rambo here.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.751
Wait, I don't think

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:28.818
that's the one I'm looking for.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.788
- I mean--
- I'm hypnotizing you.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.657
- I mean, you could
be tantalizing.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:34.491
If that's--

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.759
- Ooh!

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:41.865
- Is it cool?

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.968
- Aren't there more
people than this?

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:47.571
- Yeah, but there's a concert
or something going on in town.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:49.906
It's supposed to be
a pretty big thing.

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:51.175
But I mean, we got
enough people anyways.

01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:52.342
We'll be fine.

01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:54.744
Where's Steph?

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.446
- Uh, she forgot her cell
phone back in the car.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.414
She'll be back in a second.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:59.483
She's walking to the car.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.519
Dude!

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.288
- What's up, brother?

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:08.358
Hey, so, which one's my date?

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:12.462
Oh, you see brown
haired girl over there?

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:15.799
- You serious?

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.834
- Fuck yeah, man.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.472
- Oh. So who's the blond girl?

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:25.175
- Oh, that's Steph's
friend Claudia.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.476
I'm gonna
get them over.

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:27.377
Hey guys, you come here.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:28.645
Check this out.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:34.984
- Hello.

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:37.020
Hi, I'm Terry.

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:38.922
- Susan.

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:39.923
Nice to meet you, Terry.

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:41.425
- Likewise, Susan.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.429
So you wanna go sit down?

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:46.263
- Sure.

01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:52.602
- Anything to see around here?

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:53.837
- The trail you
guys just came up

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.305
is the only one in and
out of the parking lot.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.141
Every other trail will
take you to a dead end

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:58.775
or it twists and turns.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.610
So I wouldn't go on a walk
by yourself or anything.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:03.180
But yeah, that's basically
the main in and out trail.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.013
- Seriously?

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:04.981
- Yeah.

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.116
I mean, it's nice out here.

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:08.418
Just not much to see.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.253
You know?

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:11.888
- Stevens wrecked
right over there,

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:15.725
and I saw the Bigfoot
probably right about there.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.102
- Little kid's sneaker.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.770
- That could have
come from anybody.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.037
- Could be.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:30.274
How many little kids'
sneakers you know

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:33.109
have a long, thick
hair attached to it

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.644
that smells like shit?

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:36.011
- Probably not too many.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.846
Not too many.

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:41.185
- Looks like he
went through here.

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:42.252
I'm gonna follow this trail up,

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.520
see what else I can find.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.189
- Hank, it might be
a little dangerous.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:48.192
I'll be fine.

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:49.024
- Hank!

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.926
Do yourself a favor.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.229
Take that.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.563
- Thanks.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:54.398
Talk to you in a bit.

01:08:54.398 --> 01:08:55.465
- You got it.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:06.262
Oh, shit!

01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:18.402
- Holy shit!

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.575
Benson, this is Hank.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.944
I'm about a mile
up the trail here,

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.746
and I just came
across a dead guy

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.080
hanging about 10
feet up in a tree

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.216
with a branch through his chest.

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:37.320
Me
and Nick are on our way.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.358
- Hank, what you got?

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:16.526
- Right there.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.034
- God.

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:28.071
- Yeah, that's John.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.739
- You know that guy?

01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:31.508
- Yeah.

01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:36.079
- I gotta go back to the car,

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:37.481
go call his wife.

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:41.818
- I'm gonna follow this trail,

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:43.820
see where this end goes.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:47.824
- All right, I'll
just stay here.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.112
- Can I help you?

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.650
What happened?

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.385
- I was taken by a big creature
from my house last night,

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.588
and I just got away.

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.089
- Your name Tommy Jones?

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.257
- Yes, sir.

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:23.159
How did you know?

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.994
- You're all over
the news, sonny.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:26.329
Come on in here.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:30.466
Now, let's come on in here.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.268
We gotta get ahold
of some folks.

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:33.603
I know they're
gonna be real happy

01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:35.672
to know that you're okay.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.476
I'll bet you're really hungry.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.678
Sit down here and have a seat.

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:42.912
We'll get you something
to eat in a minute.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.581
I gotta make a call.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:59.262
Yes, ma'am, my
name is Dan Jones.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.565
That boy that's been missing,

01:15:01.565 --> 01:15:05.735
well, he just showed up at
church on Brewer Boulevard.

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:09.639
All right, thank you.

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:15.812
Okay, buddy, they're sending
somebody over here right now,

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:17.914
pick you up, take you home.

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:20.483
- Thanks, could I call my mom?

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.952
I'm sure she's awful
worried about me.

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:24.220
- You sure can.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.724
Come on over here and
let's make that call.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.565
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:36.499
Did you guys hear that?

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.668
- Yeah, I heard something.

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.874
- Hell with it, I'll
go see what it is.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.243
Anybody wanna come with me?

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:48.511
How about you, sweetheart?

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:50.213
Screw that shit.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.047
- Wuss.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:52.315
Frankie, come on.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.602
- Dude, that's some
fucking funny shit, right?

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:14.503
- No, you're a fucking asshole.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.939
- Hey dude, that
was fucking funny,

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:16.873
shut the fuck up.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:26.315
Where are you guys going?

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.384
- Oh, we're just gonna
take a little walk.

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:29.385
- All right.

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:32.188
- Watch out for the grass man!

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.389
- Yeah?

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.358
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:39.028
- So do you wanna
go for a walk, too?

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:39.863
- Where?

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:41.965
- I don't know,

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:44.300
maybe somewhere a little
more private, I guess.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.134
- Sure.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:48.772
- You guys heading out?

01:16:48.772 --> 01:16:50.273
- Yeah.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.541
Beautiful night for a walk.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.111
Steph, do you
and Frankie wanna come too?

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.345
- Yeah--

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.614
- I think we're actually
just gonna hang here.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.949
All right, babe.

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:03.987
- Yeah, just go on,
have a nice walk.

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:06.422
See you guys later.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:08.792
- Why did you do that?

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:09.693
That was so mean?

01:17:09.693 --> 01:17:10.927
- What?

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:11.861
Give them some time to
get to know each other.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.897
- Yeah, I'm sure that's why.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:15.064
- Well, it is.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.835
- Yeah, whatever, Frankie.

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:24.607
- Sure are a lot of
cars out here tonight.

01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:27.476
- Yeah, this event
does well every year.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.246
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.081
- They ever give
you any trouble?

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:34.250
- These kids? No.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.085
They're all good kids.

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.888
- It's awfully quiet.

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.323
Little too quiet.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.157
- Yeah.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:46.796
Well, let's just hang out
here just a little bit longer.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.933
See what happens.

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:54.871
- Wanna sit here and
talk a little more?

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.205
- Sure, why not?

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:03.679
- Do you mind if I kiss you?

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.748
- Sure.

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:14.357
You're a good kisser, Gary.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:15.792
- You're not so bad
yourself, Susan.

01:18:24.868 --> 01:18:26.435
Do you wanna do something else?

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.772
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:42.685
Wait, did you hear that?

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:43.519
- Hear what?

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:44.754
- What was that sound?

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:45.855
- It's probably just
animals or something.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.156
- There's animals out here?

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:50.593
- Yeah, just nothing
that can hurt you.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:54.764
- Okay, sounds like whatever
it is is gone anyway.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:56.132
- Good.

01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:57.333
Now, where were we?

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.568
- We were right about here?

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.447
Wait, what is that smell?

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.216
- Whoa, I don't know.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:15.751
Oh!

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:19.622
- So, was it you?

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.794
It was you.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.702
- That sounded like Susan.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:37.006
- Uh, Terry probably
jumped out and scared her.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.508
Look, it's nothing
to worry about, babe.

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:43.379
- I don't know, that scream
sounded really weird.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.688
- You hear that?

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:53.857
- I sure did.
- Yeah.

01:19:53.857 --> 01:19:54.891
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:55.724
- Go!

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:09.472
- Ew, what is that smell?

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:11.740
- Oh!

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.410
I don't know what that smell is.

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:22.451
Liz?

01:20:23.386 --> 01:20:24.753
Get ready to run.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.322
- What is it?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.991
- Just get ready.

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:01.424
Whoa, shit!

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:09.065
No, please no!

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:12.801
- Police department!

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.170
Watch out, there's
a Bigfoot over there!

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:16.505
My God, what do I do?

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:26.882
- Nick, are you okay?

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.751
Son of a
bitch!

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:31.187
- You guys, you gotta get me
some duct tape or some sticks,

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:33.522
rags, something like that.

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:34.757
Go, quick, quick, quick, quick.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:35.591
- Here.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:38.727
- Now get me some
sticks, come on!

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.363
Don't stand there.

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:43.299
- Here you go, sir.

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:44.467
- Here you go.

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:47.170
All right, Nick.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:48.604
I'm gonna set your leg.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.838
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:50.974
It's gonna hurt
like a bitch, okay?

01:21:50.974 --> 01:21:53.576
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:57.813
Sorry about that, buddy.

01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:00.449
Hang on.

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:02.718
Here we go.

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:03.987
That's good.

01:22:03.987 --> 01:22:05.521
That's done.

01:22:15.198 --> 01:22:16.732
- It's back, guys.

01:22:16.732 --> 01:22:20.236
- All right,
everybody, stay calm.

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.404
Nick, I gotta call this in.

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:23.172
Where's the radio?

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.408
- I must have dropped
it when it threw me.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:27.476
- Damn, Elwood.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.245
- I don't hear any more.

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:31.214
- No, it's just toying with us.

01:22:31.214 --> 01:22:32.848
- Hey, how many
kids are up here?

01:22:32.848 --> 01:22:36.385
- Uh, 10, but four
are still missing.

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.521
- Can't worry about
that right now.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:41.557
The creature's out here and
it's not going anywhere.

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:44.160
I haven't been up on
this hill for years.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.630
Does anybody know if there's
another way off this hill?

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.099
- No, just the path
you all came up.

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:52.201
Terry knows other ways,
but we can't find him.

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:55.204
- I guess we're just gonna

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:56.672
have to find a way
with that path.

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:03.879
- I do know one thing for sure.

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:05.148
Something really
pissed that thing off,

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.949
for it to go after
humans like this.

01:23:06.949 --> 01:23:09.785
It's like it's on a vendetta.

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:13.222
- How long ago did
it attack you guys?

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.190
- Not a long time ago.
Http://worldmkv.com/

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:16.492
About an hour ago.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.927
- Did you get a good
hit when you shot it?

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.530
- I definitely hit it once.

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.832
Might have missed
the other times.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.534
- If it's wounded, we'll
definitely have a better chance

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:26.735
of getting out of here alive.

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:30.606
But you guys saw that
thing, it's huge.

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:34.243
- All right, guys, everybody
try and stay calm, okay?

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:37.012
The less frantic, the better.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.614
Just stay cool.

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:40.283
We'll all get off
this hill alive.

01:23:40.283 --> 01:23:41.950
- Sounds good to me.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:46.255
- Nick, you okay to do this?

01:23:46.255 --> 01:23:48.157
- Time to find out.

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.025
- Couple of you guys help
the ranger down the hill?

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.160
- Yeah, no problem.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.328
Come on, Char.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:58.801
Sorry, sir.

01:23:58.801 --> 01:23:59.702
No, that's all right.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:01.237
Thanks for the help.

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:02.938
Let's do it.

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:45.047
- That's the way.

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.549
Yeah, right there.

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:48.784
You okay, man?

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:50.819
- No, I'm not okay, but hey,

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.288
Jimmy, do you have a cell phone?

01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:53.389
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:55.291
Here.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.993
Hey, I'm gonna go check
on the rest of 'em,

01:24:57.993 --> 01:24:58.961
make sure they're all right.

01:24:58.961 --> 01:24:59.795
- Yeah, be careful.

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:00.596
- Yeah.

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:04.900
- Yeah, dispatch, this
is Ranger Nick Thomas.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.835
I'm gonna need some emergency
service vehicles sent

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.104
up to the Buck Doll Hill
camp-out parking lot.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:11.907
If we can get those on the fly.

01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:14.877
- What is the state
of emergency, sir?

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:18.614
- My colleagues and I were
attacked by a Bigfoot.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:20.983
- Did you say a Bigfoot?

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:22.785
Are you sure?

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:23.986
- I know.

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:27.723
Just please, we need
an ambulance here ASAP.

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:28.891
- Sir, they're on their way.

01:25:28.891 --> 01:25:32.361
I told the authorities
to use caution.

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:34.430
Can I ask who your
colleagues are?

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.466
- Um, yeah, we've got
a Bigfoot researcher

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.635
and a detective.

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:43.172
Oh no, Tom.

01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:45.508
- You know Detective Benson?

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:48.377
- Yes, I do.

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:49.278
Is he okay?

01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:53.682
- As of right now.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:55.318
I don't know.

01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:59.255
Okay, please keep me
informed, Ranger Thomas.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:00.323
- No problem.

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:17.673
- What do you think
our next move is?

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.108
- I don't know, I'm thinking.

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.610
Unit 312 central,

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:24.146
we have a report of some
type of animal attack

01:26:24.146 --> 01:26:26.148
near the old gym
on Buck Doll Hill

01:26:26.148 --> 01:26:28.751
with multiple fatalities.

01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:29.785
- We gotta get over there.

01:26:29.785 --> 01:26:30.919
- You're darn tootin'.

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:31.754
- Shit.

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:47.202
- Yeah, hey Marilynn.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:50.306
Babe, I'm sorry about tonight.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:52.275
No, everything's fine.

01:26:52.275 --> 01:26:54.209
No, you wouldn't
even believe it.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.745
But yeah, I'm up by the
camp-out parking lot

01:26:56.745 --> 01:26:59.248
up near Buck Doll Hill.

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.384
No, don't come up here, we've
got this all taken care of.

01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:03.619
But I'm sorry about the.

01:27:03.619 --> 01:27:04.453
No.

01:27:06.255 --> 01:27:07.856
Hey, I gotta talk to you.

01:27:07.856 --> 01:27:09.992
Let me give you a
call back later.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:10.826
Bye.

01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:23.205
- Ranger!

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:24.307
Hey, we heard on the radio.

01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:25.508
Are you okay?

01:27:25.508 --> 01:27:27.976
- Dang, ranger,
your leg is jacked.

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:30.879
- It's fucking broke, man.

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.782
- They say we're going live mic.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:34.783
All right, what the heck?

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:37.185
Going live in five, four, three,

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.555
two.

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:41.023
Good evening.

01:27:41.023 --> 01:27:42.725
Action News reporter Steve
Darnell reporting live

01:27:42.725 --> 01:27:45.994
from what is rumored to
be a scene of horrors.

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.997
I'm in normally tranquil
Buckland, just off Highway 83.

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:51.634
If what sources are
reporting is true,

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:56.071
it is a scene of gargantuan
animal violence and murder.

01:27:56.071 --> 01:27:57.072
- Holy moly.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.610
Man, you're,

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:04.079
you're drooling, man.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:06.315
- Come on, you guys,
that's my girlfriend.

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:07.583
- Excuse me, sir.

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.084
Can you tell me
what's going on here?

01:28:09.084 --> 01:28:10.018
- No, come on, man.

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.587
I'm dealing with this.

01:28:11.587 --> 01:28:12.721
Hey, you wanna know
something about the Bigfoot,

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:14.857
talk to those guys.

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:15.891
Not me, them.

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:17.626
- Right, thank you so much.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.628
- Sir, hi, can't seem
to grab a sheriff

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:20.996
or a law enforcement.

01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:22.731
Can you tell me
what's going on here?

01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:24.066
- Yeah, uh--

01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:25.233
- Let me, let me talk to you.

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:27.370
Hi, yes, my name
is Brian Johnson

01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:30.272
and this is my business
partner Duane McCoy.

01:28:30.272 --> 01:28:32.875
First of all, I wanna offer
prayers and condolences

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:35.511
to the families of all those
who've lost their lives.

01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:38.481
We have people up here who've
literally been torn to bits.

01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:39.882
- Torn to bits.

01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:41.350
By what, did they say?

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.986
- Uh, that would be by
Bigfoot, sir, the Bigfoot.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:47.356
Possible even Bigfeet,
I kid you not.

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:50.058
- We got it on film,
secretly hidden away.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.960
- Goddamn, Duane, you old turd.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:52.995
- There you have it, folks.

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.296
I'm gonna try to get closer

01:28:54.296 --> 01:28:56.131
to speak to one of
the first responders

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:57.900
or hopefully law enforcement

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.602
as we are live on scene.

01:28:59.602 --> 01:29:01.870
- Actually, we were
first on scene, sir.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.105
First to see the thing

01:29:03.105 --> 01:29:05.908
and first to capture
the beast on film.

01:29:05.908 --> 01:29:07.109
- Wait a minute.

01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:08.711
Why are you talking
to these losers?

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:10.212
- Hey, get the fuck out of here.

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.313
- Go!
- Dumbass!

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:13.148
- Fellas, we can't do that.

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:15.117
No f-bombs, please,
we're live on air.

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:18.921
I am so sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:20.856
- I wanna apologize
for my partner, sir.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:23.459
He's very sensitive
and protective.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:25.828
We're actually two
documentary filmmakers.

01:29:25.828 --> 01:29:27.496
We have historical footage.

01:29:27.496 --> 01:29:31.667
All inquiries call
T-U-R-K-E-Y-S-H-O-T, Turkeyshot.

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:36.038
The area code and phone number
goes directly to our office.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:38.206
- And our website
is temporary down,

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.141
a little bit overloaded.

01:29:39.141 --> 01:29:41.176
But it will be updated soon.

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:43.812
- All moneyed inquiries,
call Turkeyshot.

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:45.814
This footage will blow
your fucking mind!

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:47.650
- Okay, all right, thank you.

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:48.484
Thank you.

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:49.317
Officer!

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:50.886
Good job!

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:56.058
- Look, there's the
detective and Hank.
