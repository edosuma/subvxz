WEBVTT

00:01.508 --> 00:04.467
This just in, Atlantis, home of Aquaman

00:04.492 --> 00:06.225
and character actor William H. Macy.,

00:06.227 --> 00:09.159
has been attacked only a
week before Sinking Day,

00:09.184 --> 00:10.583
the national holiday commemorating

00:10.585 --> 00:12.252
the sinking of their ancient city.

00:12.277 --> 00:13.689
Ron, I didn't know that
you and William H. Macy

00:13.714 --> 00:15.155
- are from the same place.
- Mm-hmm.

00:15.157 --> 00:17.806
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm from Atlantis.

00:17.831 --> 00:19.509
I thought you said
you were from Atlanta.

00:19.511 --> 00:20.810
No, that's Donald Glover.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.512
And it might be racist
that you heard that.

00:22.514 --> 00:25.066
Classic white person making
white person assumptions.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.285
I'm half Filipino.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.151
I thought you said you
were half Philadelphia?

00:28.176 --> 00:30.035
- What the hell is half Philadelphia?
- I don't know.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.519
All right, let's just
agree that we're all racist.

00:31.543 --> 00:32.656
Oh, we're not racist.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.124
We just don't listen to each other.

00:34.126 --> 00:36.586
Filipinos are notoriously bad listeners.

00:36.611 --> 00:39.649
- What did you just say?
- Case in point.

01:12.854 --> 01:15.573
Emily, I just got the
latest sales report.

01:15.598 --> 01:18.355
Tell me if you think that is acceptable.

01:18.605 --> 01:23.170
It says sales have gone
up 35% since January.

01:23.172 --> 01:25.472
Okay, cool, that's what I hoped it said.

01:25.474 --> 01:26.940
I'm not a big chart guy.

01:26.942 --> 01:30.611
So I think that kind of
effort deserves a reward.

01:30.613 --> 01:31.892
Well, thank you, Van.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.547
Which is why I'm telling my father

01:33.549 --> 01:35.916
it is time I was promoted
to the Gotham office.

01:35.918 --> 01:38.723
Wait, what? Why would
you get the promotion?

01:38.748 --> 01:40.621
January is the month that I started.

01:40.623 --> 01:41.920
Meaning what?

01:41.945 --> 01:44.024
That's when sales started going up.

01:44.026 --> 01:45.340
Meaning what?

01:45.365 --> 01:47.628
I think we can point to one main reason.

01:47.738 --> 01:50.018
Right! This guy.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.745
Emily, you're great at your job,

01:52.770 --> 01:56.305
but you need to remember
that I am "da boss,"

01:56.307 --> 01:59.041
which means that it is your
job to execute my vision.

01:59.043 --> 02:01.544
And my vision is for sales to go up,

02:01.546 --> 02:02.859
and they did.

02:02.884 --> 02:04.897
So you're going to sit with your dad,

02:04.899 --> 02:07.700
and honestly say you
deserve a promotion?

02:07.725 --> 02:10.318
Van Senior is on the
board of Wayne Industries,

02:10.344 --> 02:12.688
a scratch golfer,

02:12.931 --> 02:14.273
a devoted husband,

02:14.298 --> 02:17.349
and a dedicated lover
to several mistresses.

02:17.351 --> 02:19.885
He doesn't have time to sit with me.

02:19.887 --> 02:22.221
I was hoping to fly to
Gotham and talk to him

02:22.223 --> 02:24.723
while we walked to where
his Testarossa was parked.

02:27.803 --> 02:29.152
- And I could.
- The whole time?

02:29.177 --> 02:30.593
- Hey, Ron!
- Hey, Alex!

02:30.618 --> 02:32.411
- Hey, boss.
- Hey.

02:32.448 --> 02:33.948
Why does Alex keep calling me boss?

02:33.973 --> 02:36.037
- That's so annoying.
- Man, what do you mean?

02:36.069 --> 02:37.450
It's just a term of endearment.

02:37.475 --> 02:39.258
No, it's a condescending
thing to say to someone

02:39.260 --> 02:40.793
that you don't respect.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.061
Hey, boss.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.280
Pow!

02:43.998 --> 02:45.350
There's something off about Alex.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.827
Yeah, Alex gets me off too.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.868
Wait, what did you say?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.137
Breaking news flash. A
school bus full of children

02:52.139 --> 02:53.405
has just gone through the railing

02:53.407 --> 02:54.940
of the Charm City Bridge,

02:54.942 --> 02:57.376
and is teetering 400 feet above the bay.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.044
Our own Marv Wolfman is on the scene.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.680
Sorry, boss, there's
something I need to attend to.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.417
Looks like new guy has diarrhea.

03:04.442 --> 03:06.596
Not so attractive now, huh, Jackie?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.864
Nah, I'm still in.

03:09.528 --> 03:11.901
What's this? Coming out of the sky,

03:11.926 --> 03:15.198
a man in a golden helmet is
lifting the bus to safety.

03:19.857 --> 03:22.067
_

03:29.115 --> 03:32.227
Hey, now, we all just saw Alex
run out of here, and then...

03:32.701 --> 03:34.731
- you don't think...
- About him naked?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.108
Yes, I do.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.167
Okay, Ace Chemicals is
gonna be here in a sec.

03:42.169 --> 03:43.897
Let's run this one more time.

03:43.922 --> 03:46.271
What is the greatest
generator of supervillains

03:46.273 --> 03:47.852
aside from bad parenting?

03:47.908 --> 03:50.187
- Being bitten by things.
- Laboratory mishaps.

03:50.212 --> 03:51.478
Losing the popular vote,

03:51.480 --> 03:53.379
but somehow winning the election.

03:53.381 --> 03:54.981
Hey, guys, come on.

03:54.983 --> 03:56.666
Ron, your line is,

03:56.668 --> 03:59.269
"It's people falling
into vats of chemicals."

03:59.271 --> 04:01.054
Do not give me a line reading, Emily.

04:01.056 --> 04:02.439
It is insulting.

04:02.441 --> 04:04.274
Ace Chemicals is our biggest client.

04:04.276 --> 04:05.909
I wanna make sure it is perfect.

04:08.547 --> 04:11.792
But then my dad got
them to drop the charges!

04:12.417 --> 04:14.234
But we're still banned from Lake Havasu,

04:14.236 --> 04:16.166
you piece of [bleep].

04:16.192 --> 04:18.188
Emily, let me introduce you

04:18.190 --> 04:19.822
to this piece of [bleep] right here.

04:19.825 --> 04:22.036
- This is Royce Kane.
- Nice to meet you.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.889
Ready for the presentation,
you pieces of [bleep]?

04:26.484 --> 04:27.796
Oh, my God.

04:27.821 --> 04:29.460
I am so sorry. I-I just...

04:31.527 --> 04:33.137
Look at you!

04:33.139 --> 04:35.539
Just busting your chops!

04:35.541 --> 04:37.642
All right, let's talk vats.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.910
Okay, so last year,
flaws in our safety grate

04:40.935 --> 04:43.970
resulted in roughly one clown
villain every three months.

04:43.972 --> 04:46.272
So we changed the material on the grate

04:46.274 --> 04:49.075
- to an acid-proof alloy.
- I'm a little confused.

04:49.077 --> 04:50.676
We're not interested
in mechanical grates.

04:50.678 --> 04:53.012
We wanna upgrade to
a force field system.

04:53.014 --> 04:55.281
And I explained all this in my email.

04:55.283 --> 04:59.154
Oh... now, well, it sounds
like somebody dropped the ball.

04:59.179 --> 05:00.958
Who did you send the email to?

05:00.983 --> 05:02.608
- You.
- Huh?

05:03.168 --> 05:06.270
Oh, it probably got
caught in my spam filter.

05:06.295 --> 05:07.973
You responded, "Sounds good,"

05:07.998 --> 05:10.115
with a gif of two dogs humping.

05:11.193 --> 05:12.262
That does sound like me.

05:12.287 --> 05:13.487
You know, this isn't the first time

05:13.489 --> 05:14.865
that you've dropped the ball.

05:14.890 --> 05:17.910
Normally, I'd let it go
because our families are close,

05:17.935 --> 05:19.952
but I've got a company to run.

05:19.977 --> 05:22.651
I'm sorry, but we're going to LexCorp.

05:26.001 --> 05:28.634
That's it? I don't
even get to say my line?

05:28.659 --> 05:30.143
I mean, this is my
sixth grade production

05:30.168 --> 05:32.409
of "Anne Frank" all over again!

05:39.377 --> 05:43.013
You might have heard that
we suffered a little setback.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.182
Little? Jackie, how
big was that account?

05:45.207 --> 05:47.173
$75 million annually.

05:47.776 --> 05:49.650
$75 million!

05:51.714 --> 05:53.847
I'm, uh, struggling.

05:53.849 --> 05:55.047
Thank you.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.977
One of many accounts.

05:59.753 --> 06:00.851
Wayne Security.

06:00.876 --> 06:02.476
Look, it's great that you can mess up

06:02.478 --> 06:04.178
and there's never any consequences,

06:04.180 --> 06:06.980
but the rest of us don't have
your dad to take care of us.

06:06.982 --> 06:09.183
How dare you. I am a grown man.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.719
I'm not taken care of by my "daddy."

06:11.721 --> 06:14.755
Van, your father's helicopter
just landed on the roof.

06:14.757 --> 06:16.356
Daddy?

06:16.630 --> 06:18.146
Here in Charm City?

06:18.171 --> 06:19.660
Did he land angrily?

06:28.123 --> 06:30.590
Oh, it's an honor to work with me?

06:30.592 --> 06:33.393
Well, thank you, Bill and Melinda Gates.

06:33.395 --> 06:35.829
Uh, hey, Dad. Bye.

06:35.831 --> 06:37.653
I just got off the phone with the Kanes.

06:37.678 --> 06:39.878
When I started here,
this division was nothing,

06:39.880 --> 06:41.069
so what did I do?

06:41.094 --> 06:42.185
I opened up the phone-book.

06:42.210 --> 06:43.733
I started at the beginning.

06:43.758 --> 06:46.659
Guess which client I landed first.

06:46.871 --> 06:48.388
AARP.

06:48.861 --> 06:50.106
AAA?

06:50.473 --> 06:52.108
- Aaron Brothers?
- It's Ace Chemicals.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.243
How can you not get
that from the context?

06:54.245 --> 06:57.075
- Oh.
- I created that relationship.

06:57.348 --> 06:59.982
I nurtured it for 30 years,

06:59.984 --> 07:02.017
and you just pissed it away.

07:02.019 --> 07:04.620
You don't even like the
Kanes. You said yourself,

07:04.622 --> 07:06.922
they have no understanding
of marina etiquette.

07:06.924 --> 07:09.091
They christened their yacht with Korbel.

07:09.093 --> 07:12.595
You are a turd in my toilet,
and you can't even swim.

07:12.597 --> 07:14.123
I can float.

07:14.148 --> 07:17.115
I have overlooked a lot of
your transgressions, kid,

07:17.295 --> 07:19.702
but it's now time you
face some consequences.

07:19.704 --> 07:22.257
What are you gonna
do? Take away the boat?

07:22.819 --> 07:25.107
The ski-in, ski-out chalet?

07:25.109 --> 07:26.475
Not the trust fund.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.177
Oh, no.

07:28.312 --> 07:30.905
Something much more important than that.

07:31.437 --> 07:34.963
The last remaining shred of
respect that I had for you.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.366
What?

07:45.660 --> 07:47.579
You wanted to see me?

07:47.604 --> 07:49.867
In a way, I envy you, Emily.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.936
Your father is a poor,
so it doesn't matter

07:51.961 --> 07:53.547
if you have his respect.

07:53.572 --> 07:54.717
Okay, you know what?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.630
You could learn a lot from my dad.

07:56.632 --> 07:57.687
He had a flower shop,

07:57.712 --> 07:59.576
and through thick and
thin, he kept it open.

07:59.601 --> 08:01.975
He always said, "Put in the
work and the rest will come."

08:02.000 --> 08:05.406
My dad always said, "Buy your mistress
the same perfume as your wife."

08:05.431 --> 08:07.861
- Why am I here?
- You are going to help me

08:07.863 --> 08:09.311
regain my father's respect.

08:09.336 --> 08:12.237
And do you know how we
are going to do that?

08:12.239 --> 08:13.672
No. How?

08:13.674 --> 08:16.274
God damn it!

08:16.276 --> 08:18.226
Jackie, send Teddy in!

08:18.251 --> 08:20.769
- Hey, hold on, hold on.
- Hold on! Hold on!

08:20.794 --> 08:22.693
Why would you care what I think?

08:22.695 --> 08:25.546
I mean, I only execute
your vision, right?

08:25.548 --> 08:28.383
I have no vision of my own.

08:29.636 --> 08:32.604
I see what is happening here.

08:32.605 --> 08:33.953
Hmm.

08:34.635 --> 08:35.797
What do you want?

08:35.821 --> 08:39.222
I wanna be promoted to SVP
of Research and Development,

08:39.224 --> 08:41.625
and I want that mug.

08:41.626 --> 08:44.494
But how will I know I'm "da
boss" if I don't have "da mug"?

08:44.496 --> 08:47.197
Look, you lost a big client.

08:47.199 --> 08:49.449
The only way to get your dad's respect

08:49.451 --> 08:51.451
is if you go get another one.

08:51.453 --> 08:53.750
And by you, you mean...

08:53.775 --> 08:55.475
- Us.
- It's the royal you?

08:55.477 --> 08:57.944
- Start making calls.
- Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

08:57.946 --> 09:00.447
You know, we Waynes
didn't get to where we are

09:00.449 --> 09:02.515
by being afraid of hard work.

09:02.517 --> 09:05.923
We did it by leveraging a
coal monopoly in the 1870s.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.925
Same chin. Same body type.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.923
I'm telling you guys,
Alex is the Olympian.

09:14.948 --> 09:16.614
I guess the only way to know for certain

09:16.616 --> 09:18.416
is for one of us to sleep with him.

09:18.418 --> 09:19.907
Fine, I'll do it.

09:19.932 --> 09:21.313
If you have the power of flight,

09:21.338 --> 09:23.137
you don't also decide to
get an accounting degree.

09:23.139 --> 09:24.481
You just fly around.

09:24.506 --> 09:26.341
Duh. Alter ego?

09:26.343 --> 09:28.643
Just like my theory that Bruce
Wayne is really The Flash,

09:28.645 --> 09:30.111
and that Stephen Baldwin

09:30.113 --> 09:32.580
is just a character
played by Alec Baldwin.

09:32.582 --> 09:35.450
Okay, I'm not buying it, but I'm
very intrigued by the Baldwin thing.

09:35.452 --> 09:37.418
All right, look, if Alex is a superhero,

09:37.443 --> 09:39.326
then he should be able to catch...

09:39.351 --> 09:40.474
- ... this.
- Hey!

09:40.499 --> 09:41.598
Oops.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.037
Whoa, look out, boss.

09:43.062 --> 09:44.638
Well, I mean, of course
he's not going to catch it.

09:44.663 --> 09:45.748
It would give him away.

09:45.773 --> 09:47.927
My kid made that mug, you idiot.

09:50.539 --> 09:52.317
♪ Daddy doesn't love me ♪

09:52.342 --> 09:55.786
♪ I can ski in and out of the chalet ♪

09:55.811 --> 09:58.206
♪ But not into his heart ♪

09:58.208 --> 10:00.052
Ooh, that's good.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.578
- ♪ Not into his heart ♪
- What are you doing?

10:02.580 --> 10:04.146
You're supposed to be making calls.

10:04.148 --> 10:06.715
I tried. It was hard,
so I took a break to jam.

10:06.717 --> 10:08.517
I found a sweet riff,
and then you came in

10:08.519 --> 10:09.727
and messed up my flow.

10:09.752 --> 10:11.153
I've been on the phone all day.

10:11.155 --> 10:13.359
Now, remember how Atlantis got attacked?

10:13.384 --> 10:14.384
I called them.

10:14.409 --> 10:15.642
I didn't know when to call though,

10:15.667 --> 10:18.101
because what time zone is Atlantis in?

10:18.126 --> 10:20.092
I mean, do they have
daylight savings time?

10:20.117 --> 10:22.050
Do they even have daylight?

10:22.052 --> 10:24.019
♪ Does Atlantis have daylight? ♪

10:24.021 --> 10:26.321
♪ Or is it always night? ♪

10:26.346 --> 10:28.267
♪ Are some monkeys real? ♪

10:28.292 --> 10:29.792
♪ Do... ♪ What?

10:29.794 --> 10:31.493
They wanna hear our pitch.

10:31.495 --> 10:33.729
We have a chance to
supply security products

10:33.731 --> 10:35.391
to all of Atlantis.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.883
This is huge! Way bigger
than Ace Chemicals.

10:37.885 --> 10:39.584
Yes! We did it!

10:39.586 --> 10:41.787
God bless those weird
little fish people.

10:41.789 --> 10:43.516
That is actually very insensitive.

10:43.541 --> 10:45.103
You know, Ron is from Atlantis.

10:45.128 --> 10:46.868
I thought he said he was from Atlanta.

10:54.081 --> 10:56.096
- So those are the guys from Atlantis?
- Mm-hmm.

10:56.121 --> 10:58.174
And you're from the same place as them?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.428
Crazy, right?

10:59.453 --> 11:02.265
'Cause they're so dour,
and I'm so cheerful.

11:02.823 --> 11:05.124
- Yeah, it's a demeanor thing.
- Yeah, totally.

11:05.126 --> 11:07.670
All right, we hooked 'em,
so let's go reel 'em in.

11:07.695 --> 11:08.961
Ooh.

11:08.963 --> 11:11.864
Emily, underwater people
do not like language

11:11.866 --> 11:13.748
like "hooked" or "reel 'em in."

11:13.773 --> 11:15.931
- Good catch.
- That's another one.

11:15.956 --> 11:17.522
Okay.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.194
Land people.

11:20.231 --> 11:22.857
So those are just a
couple of the products

11:22.882 --> 11:25.583
we think could really
help make Atlantis safe,

11:25.585 --> 11:28.786
so you don't always have to
rely on Aquaman to protect you.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.354
You've given us a lot to think about.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.681
We'll give you an answer
in a couple of weeks.

11:32.706 --> 11:35.690
We need to head home for Sinking Day.

11:38.062 --> 11:41.017
Well, it has been an
absolute pleasure meeting you.

11:41.049 --> 11:42.486
If you have any questions at all,

11:42.511 --> 11:43.861
you can email me directly.

11:43.886 --> 11:45.877
I love Sinking Day.

11:45.902 --> 11:48.232
I celebrate it every year.
I got to get my sink on.

11:48.257 --> 11:49.821
You celebrate Sinking Day?

11:49.846 --> 11:51.891
Yes! I throw a huge party.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.397
I'm famous for it.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.075
Aquaman drops by...

11:55.077 --> 11:57.645
- Anyways, here are some mater...
- You know Aquaman?

11:57.670 --> 11:59.287
We are very close personal friends.

11:59.289 --> 12:01.139
He always brings the seaweed salad.

12:01.164 --> 12:03.565
I love to chill with A-to-the-Q.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.327
- Now as I was saying...
- Uh, we would love to chill

12:05.352 --> 12:07.202
with A-to-the-Q.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.623
Could, uh, we celebrate
with you tomorrow?

12:11.365 --> 12:13.467
- Yes!
- And meet Aquaman?

12:13.469 --> 12:15.575
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

12:19.398 --> 12:20.975
Laughing's fun.

12:26.727 --> 12:28.476
And that's why they call me the closer.

12:28.501 --> 12:30.801
Move over, Kyra Sedgwick.

12:30.803 --> 12:33.371
Jackie! Send me a gift basket.

12:33.373 --> 12:35.673
You're sending yourself a gift basket?

12:35.675 --> 12:37.842
Yes, it's called self-care, Emily.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.643
Van, follow my logic.

12:39.645 --> 12:41.696
- You don't know Aquaman.
- Mm.

12:41.698 --> 12:43.948
When the Atlantians show
up, and Aquaman's not there,

12:43.950 --> 12:45.357
we're going to lose the deal.

12:45.382 --> 12:47.980
We were already going
to lose the deal, Emily.

12:48.005 --> 12:49.453
That's the first rule of business.

12:49.455 --> 12:51.655
Never let them leave without a yes.

12:51.657 --> 12:53.891
Well, I'm pretty sure the
second rule of business

12:53.893 --> 12:55.893
is don't make promises
you can't deliver.

12:55.895 --> 12:57.161
If that was a rule,

12:57.186 --> 12:59.040
there would be no
such thing as business.

12:59.065 --> 13:01.399
Emily! We'll figure it out later,

13:01.401 --> 13:03.645
after we wow them with this party.

13:03.670 --> 13:06.347
How am I supposed to wow
them with a party tomorrow

13:06.372 --> 13:08.372
when we don't even know
what Sinking Day is?

13:08.374 --> 13:10.041
I provided the vision,

13:10.066 --> 13:12.220
which is for you to make it happen.

13:12.245 --> 13:13.411
You asked me to help,

13:13.413 --> 13:14.845
and then you made me do all the work

13:14.847 --> 13:16.289
while you wrote a song.

13:16.314 --> 13:18.149
You know, I worked
every summer for my dad.

13:18.151 --> 13:20.651
Oh, God, tales from the flower shop.

13:20.653 --> 13:21.886
Yeah, that's right.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.754
That's where I learned hard work.

13:23.756 --> 13:25.459
And I was hoping I would end up working

13:25.484 --> 13:27.024
for someone like my father...

13:27.026 --> 13:29.943
someone inspiring, a mentor...

13:30.229 --> 13:32.033
yet I ended up with you.

13:32.206 --> 13:34.239
I'm starting to get where
your dad's coming from.

13:34.264 --> 13:37.712
Oh... and I'm starting to get
where your dad is coming from!

13:37.737 --> 13:39.221
Which is a flower shop,

13:39.246 --> 13:41.635
because you won't shut
the hell up about it!

13:44.077 --> 13:47.069
That's right.
Congratulations on a good job

13:47.094 --> 13:49.626
both to and from Van.

13:50.283 --> 13:51.610
I know.

13:53.453 --> 13:56.219
Psst. Psst!

13:57.991 --> 13:59.341
P-sst!

14:00.059 --> 14:02.435
- Come here!
- Oh, my God.

14:06.766 --> 14:10.267
Guys, I've been tracking Alex's
bathroom habits very closely.

14:10.269 --> 14:12.770
That feels like an HR
issue, but continue.

14:12.772 --> 14:15.873
I believe that's where Alex
changes into his Olympian costume.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.642
For instance, at 12:06 p.m.,

14:18.644 --> 14:20.211
the Olympian stopped a mugging.

14:20.213 --> 14:23.147
Now, at 12:05, Alex went to the bathroom

14:23.149 --> 14:24.782
for exactly two minutes,

14:24.784 --> 14:26.450
which is too long for a number one,

14:26.452 --> 14:28.486
yet too short for a number two,

14:28.511 --> 14:29.793
which means...

14:29.818 --> 14:30.964
You're a crazy person.

14:30.989 --> 14:32.623
Oh, am I?

14:32.625 --> 14:34.466
Well, I thought you might be skeptical,

14:34.491 --> 14:35.645
which is why I'm putting

14:35.670 --> 14:38.806
Operation Fake Lady
Getting Mugged into effect.

14:38.831 --> 14:40.333
What the hell is Operation
Fake Lady Getting...

14:40.358 --> 14:41.763
Oh, my God!

14:41.788 --> 14:44.534
There's a real lady
getting mugged down there!

14:44.559 --> 14:45.941
Okay.

14:49.142 --> 14:51.179
Okay, now put a camera
into the bathroom,

14:51.221 --> 14:52.720
so we can watch Alex change. Let's go.

14:52.745 --> 14:54.145
- Ron...
- Let him finish.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.546
No-no-no-no, this is
getting out of hand.

14:55.571 --> 14:56.945
He is not a superhero, okay?

14:56.970 --> 14:59.343
And I don't want you to look more
foolish than you already have.

14:59.368 --> 15:01.339
- What?
- Where'd Alex go?

15:03.523 --> 15:05.708
It doesn't mean...

15:09.328 --> 15:11.362
I'm sold. Just to be sure,

15:11.364 --> 15:13.030
I think we should probably take a look

15:13.032 --> 15:15.356
at that footage of Alex changing.

15:15.501 --> 15:16.841
You're right.

15:24.877 --> 15:26.848
Oh, hey, look. Okay.

15:27.054 --> 15:30.525
Welcome to our annual
Sinking Day celebration!

15:30.550 --> 15:32.516
- What do you think?
- This is nothing like

15:32.518 --> 15:34.697
any Sinking Day party I've ever been to.

15:34.722 --> 15:37.788
- Oh, well, uh...
- It's way better!

15:37.790 --> 15:39.775
Look at that sculpture of King Orin!

15:39.800 --> 15:43.056
He's even half circumcised,
which is our way.

15:43.385 --> 15:45.396
Uh, so glad you like it.

15:45.398 --> 15:47.314
Wait until we bring out the tuna!

15:47.316 --> 15:50.317
Ah! Yes! The noble tuna,

15:50.319 --> 15:53.227
our most valuable ally,
and trusted friend.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.618
Oh...

15:55.016 --> 15:56.712
Go, go, go!

15:56.737 --> 15:59.923
Ah, you have touched our hearts.

16:00.596 --> 16:03.697
I guess the only question
now is, where's Aquaman?

16:03.699 --> 16:05.399
Ahh! Yes.

16:05.401 --> 16:08.502
Well, you know, Aquaman is like...

16:08.504 --> 16:10.350
Aha, friends!

16:11.587 --> 16:12.614
Welcome.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.368
A little fly in the ointment.

16:14.393 --> 16:16.777
- A-to-the-Q can't make it.
- Oh.

16:16.779 --> 16:20.064
But he sends this
Cognac Grande Champagne

16:20.066 --> 16:21.584
du LaCoursiere.

16:21.609 --> 16:25.655
Lars, I believe you are a connoisseur.

16:26.405 --> 16:28.839
There are only four bottles
of this in the world.

16:30.005 --> 16:31.441
And Albert,

16:31.466 --> 16:33.833
I understand you're
somewhat of a film buff.

16:33.858 --> 16:37.760
For you, the complete
works of Brendan Fraser.

16:37.850 --> 16:40.084
The master.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.518
Brendan Fraser?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.454
He's revered in
Atlantis for some reason.

16:43.456 --> 16:46.257
- Huh.
- And for Anthony,

16:46.259 --> 16:48.225
perfume for your wife,

16:48.227 --> 16:52.546
and a second bottle of the
same perfume for whoever.

16:52.548 --> 16:54.365
Oh.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.100
Oh, yeah!

16:56.102 --> 16:58.765
I have to be honest with you,
when we left that meeting,

16:58.790 --> 17:00.254
we were gonna go with a local company.

17:00.256 --> 17:02.380
Really? Can you believe that, Emily?

17:02.405 --> 17:03.993
I'm just as surprised as you, Van.

17:04.017 --> 17:05.398
Ah! You know what, gentlemen,

17:05.424 --> 17:07.452
why don't we crack open
that bottle of LaCoursiere

17:07.477 --> 17:09.387
and hammer out these details?

17:09.390 --> 17:10.689
Sarah, conference room.

17:14.528 --> 17:15.905
Third rule of business,

17:15.930 --> 17:17.740
find out personal information
about your clients,

17:17.765 --> 17:19.256
and exploit it for your own gain.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.743
I guess there are some things
I can still learn from you.

17:21.769 --> 17:24.736
Well, what do you say we
go sign the biggest client

17:24.738 --> 17:27.005
this division has ever had?

17:28.299 --> 17:29.961
You're not signing anyone.

17:29.986 --> 17:31.777
I heard that Atlantis is interested,

17:31.779 --> 17:34.246
and this is far too
important for you to screw up.

17:34.248 --> 17:36.214
- But, Dad...
- I'll handle it.

17:48.261 --> 17:49.801
♪ Why did Daddy pull off ♪

17:49.826 --> 17:51.726
♪ My butterfly wings? ♪

17:51.751 --> 17:53.712
♪ I used to be a caterpillar ♪

17:53.737 --> 17:56.061
♪ Now all I do is scream ♪

17:56.062 --> 17:58.343
♪ Daddy issues need some tissues ♪

18:00.430 --> 18:01.570
Van?

18:01.595 --> 18:02.777
Don't come any closer.

18:02.802 --> 18:04.694
I'm naked from the waist down.

18:05.305 --> 18:07.471
- It calms me.
- Well, I just thought

18:07.473 --> 18:09.743
there was something you needed to hear.

18:09.883 --> 18:12.944
You put in the work,
and did something great.

18:12.946 --> 18:15.766
And do you know who would've
respected the hell out of that?

18:15.791 --> 18:17.124
My dad.

18:17.149 --> 18:18.548
You never speak of your mother.

18:18.573 --> 18:21.327
Did you drive her to
suicide with these stories?

18:21.521 --> 18:23.421
Look, if you want your
own father's respect,

18:23.423 --> 18:26.405
go in there and be "da boss."

18:26.850 --> 18:28.764
I am "da boss."

18:29.199 --> 18:30.295
Go!

18:31.331 --> 18:33.655
- Dear, God.
- Oh, yeah, whoops, just...

18:33.786 --> 18:37.068
So I opened up the phone book,
and I started at the beginning,

18:37.203 --> 18:38.836
and guess who I landed first.

18:38.838 --> 18:41.172
Father, Mom's on the phone.

18:41.174 --> 18:42.401
She's crying hysterically.

18:42.426 --> 18:45.026
She's outside the condo
of a woman named Sasha?

18:48.715 --> 18:49.956
I'll be right back.

18:51.184 --> 18:53.217
Would you stop playing
games? Now listen to me...

18:53.219 --> 18:54.589
No, you listen to me.

18:54.614 --> 18:57.265
I am the one who put this
party together sort of,

18:57.290 --> 18:58.433
and I'm the one who lied

18:58.458 --> 19:00.269
and said that Aquaman was gonna be here,

19:00.294 --> 19:02.962
and I was the one who bought
a middling bottle of Cognac,

19:02.996 --> 19:05.196
and had his secretary
soak the label in tea,

19:05.198 --> 19:08.332
so get out of my way, you
therapy-inducing windbag!

19:08.334 --> 19:10.067
This is my account to close!

19:10.069 --> 19:12.637
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:12.639 --> 19:13.838
Because I was about to tell you

19:13.840 --> 19:15.306
the Atlantians only wanna deal with you

19:15.308 --> 19:17.642
and that Filipino woman.

19:17.644 --> 19:19.510
- Is that what she is?
- I was also gonna say

19:19.512 --> 19:21.766
that maybe for the
first time in your life,

19:22.582 --> 19:24.398
I'm proud of you.

19:24.684 --> 19:27.652
- You can say it now.
- Nah, moment's passed.

19:27.654 --> 19:29.748
Now get in there and close
the deal, you piece of [bleep].

19:29.773 --> 19:30.811
Ah, Dad.

19:32.358 --> 19:33.959
Don't touch.

19:36.996 --> 19:38.763
Wait, so you really want
me to walk you through

19:38.765 --> 19:40.197
how we process expense reports?

19:40.199 --> 19:42.538
Yes, very slowly.

19:42.769 --> 19:45.835
Okay, well, let's get
our spreadsheet on!

19:47.373 --> 19:49.507
Yucky. The only thing
this footage proves

19:49.509 --> 19:51.375
is that Gary from Marketing
doesn't wash his hands.

19:51.377 --> 19:52.525
Mm.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.191
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

19:57.193 --> 19:59.705
Well, I mean, Alex must've
changed in the supply closet.

19:59.707 --> 20:01.947
What I need to do is set
up a series of cameras...

20:01.972 --> 20:03.855
For the last time, he's not a superhero.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.289
He is.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.259
You must believe in something
bigger than yourself,

20:08.261 --> 20:10.728
or there is only hopelessness.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.296
Where the hell did you get that?

20:12.298 --> 20:14.065
That was my line in the
sixth grade production

20:14.067 --> 20:16.734
of "Anne Frank," but
I feel like it applies.

20:16.736 --> 20:18.134
Hm.

20:18.159 --> 20:19.876
And that's why I moved
the remainder over.

20:19.901 --> 20:21.939
That's fascinating. I'm
gonna get us some drinks.

20:21.941 --> 20:23.240
Don't go anywhere.

20:23.242 --> 20:25.409
- Hold my drink.
- Okay.

20:32.552 --> 20:34.841
Not a superhero.

20:34.866 --> 20:35.920
Okay.

20:35.922 --> 20:38.556
Attention, everyone,
we have an announcement.

20:38.558 --> 20:41.392
Wayne Security has a new client.

20:41.394 --> 20:43.494
The Lost City of Atlantis!

20:46.132 --> 20:49.266
All right, now let's get our sink on!

20:50.607 --> 20:52.002
Bring out the tuna!

20:52.004 --> 20:53.838
