WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.921
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.921 --> 00:07.424
Here's something about
a show of impressionists

00:07.424 --> 00:08.925
coming to Boston this fall.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.343
Well, why wait?

00:10.343 --> 00:12.345
I do one that'll knock your socks off.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.131
He's talkin' about
French painters, doofus.

00:15.131 --> 00:16.466
Yeah? Well, so am I.

00:16.466 --> 00:18.468
Yeah, I do a great Cezanne.

00:18.468 --> 00:20.854
Get outta here. No, I do. Watch this.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.773
(French accent): Hosey,
posey, life is perfect.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.859
(as John Wayne): Hey, ya better smile

00:25.859 --> 00:27.861
when ya say that, Pilgrim.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.863
(as James Stewart): Now, now, now, now,

00:29.863 --> 00:31.865
just a-just a darned
second there, young fella.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.867
(all chuckling)

00:34.868 --> 00:37.370
Okay, okay, I got one. Watch this.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.542
(with country accent): Hey, fellers.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.045
I believe we might be
in for just a little rain

00:45.045 --> 00:46.913
before this day's over.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.631
Woody, who is that?

00:48.631 --> 00:51.801
It's Dwight Womack,
mayor of Hanover, Indiana.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.589
No, Woody, Woody, when
you do impressions,

00:56.589 --> 00:58.591
you gotta do impressions
of famous people.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.477
Well, if I could do somebody famous,

01:00.477 --> 01:01.978
why would I be doin' Dwight Womack?

01:01.978 --> 01:03.480
Yeah, good point.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.482
Yeah, he's got a point.

01:06.983 --> 01:10.854
(piano plays)

01:10.854 --> 01:13.323
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:13.323 --> 01:16.326
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:16.326 --> 01:19.329
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:19.329 --> 01:22.332
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:22.332 --> 01:27.587
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:27.587 --> 01:30.373
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:30.373 --> 01:35.378
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:35.378 --> 01:40.383
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:40.383 --> 01:42.385
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:42.385 --> 01:45.388
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:45.388 --> 01:50.393
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:50.393 --> 01:53.396
? You want to go where people know ?

01:53.396 --> 01:55.398
? People are all the same ?

01:55.899 --> 02:00.403
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

Hey, everybody.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.476
(all calling out greetings)

02:23.476 --> 02:25.228
Sam?

02:28.264 --> 02:31.568
This is our first time
back in Cheers since,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.069
you know, yesterday.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.572
Don't you think we should
announce our engagement?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.073
Oh. All right. Okay.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.575
Go ahead. Go ahead.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.576
Oh, no, no, you do it.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.444
You're the man.

02:41.444 --> 02:42.579
All right, listen up, everybody.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.164
I have an announcement to make here.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.498
Uh, Diane and I decided to...

02:45.498 --> 02:46.499
Oh, Sam, (clears throat)

02:46.499 --> 02:47.500
what are you going to say?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.502
Well, I was just going to tell them...

02:49.502 --> 02:50.503
(speaks softly)

02:51.004 --> 02:52.372
I see.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.624
SAM: Well, what do you want me to say?

02:54.624 --> 02:57.260
(Diane whispering)

02:57.260 --> 03:00.096
Oh, come on, Diane, nobody
knows who the Lunts are.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.052
Due to our desire
to be-- what?

03:06.052 --> 03:08.054
Conjoined. Conjoined, uh...

03:09.055 --> 03:11.057
hey, well, Diane and I, uh,

03:11.057 --> 03:13.560
would like you to, uh, celebrate with us

03:13.560 --> 03:15.562
by, uh, toasting our nuptials.

03:15.562 --> 03:16.946
Ouch.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.233
No, no, Woody, it's, uh...

03:22.569 --> 03:26.072
What Sam so eloquently
expressed was that he and I

03:26.573 --> 03:29.576
have officially become
engaged to be married.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.045
(cheering and applause)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.548
How about that Al, huh?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.050
CLIFF: Oh, marriage, Sam.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.501
I thought you'd said
you'd never marry Diane.

03:38.501 --> 03:42.005
Well, I-I never, uh, said that exactly.

03:42.005 --> 03:43.923
No, no, I think the exact
words were "I'd rather have

03:43.923 --> 03:45.925
every hair on my body
pulled out simultaneously."

03:47.927 --> 03:50.930
Well, that-that's just an expression.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.432
I mean...

03:52.432 --> 03:53.933
No, seriously, you know,

03:53.933 --> 03:56.436
we all knew it was going
to happen sooner or later.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.438
I just thought I'd get it over with.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.356
Well, Diane, Sam,
congratulations to both of you.

04:00.356 --> 04:01.858
Diane, I hope you're planning

04:01.858 --> 04:03.860
to stay for the entire
ceremony this time.

04:03.860 --> 04:04.744
Ours was... (laughs)

04:05.578 --> 04:09.449
Ours was very touching, I thought.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.834
Well, another one bites
the matrimonial dust.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.336
I guess that leaves only one stud

04:13.336 --> 04:15.204
to satisfy all the babes in this bar.

04:15.204 --> 04:18.091
Yeah, I can handle it, too.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.594
Hi.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.097
I bet you never thought
you'd see the day, huh?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.098
Nice shirt, Sam.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.100
Is it new?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.968
No, it's not. It, uh...

04:28.968 --> 04:30.803
Did you hear what I said up there

04:30.803 --> 04:33.189
about me and Diane getting engaged?

04:33.189 --> 04:34.440
The beer distributor called.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.942
He wants to know if he can change

04:35.942 --> 04:37.694
the delivery day to Wednesday.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.198
Carla,

04:42.198 --> 04:45.535
I know that we haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

04:45.535 --> 04:48.371
but you could at least wish us well.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.739
I need a draft.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.375
Fascinating.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
She's experiencing denial.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.879
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?

04:56.879 --> 05:00.383
Well, simply put, it
means that the human mind

05:00.383 --> 05:04.387
blocks out that which it
cannot emotionally accept.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.390
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.395
It means that you don't understand this,

05:12.395 --> 05:13.896
and you never will.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.899
Oh.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.154
I think perhaps I should get
personally involved in this.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.655
After all, Carla is a good friend.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.524
I think I could help her

05:24.524 --> 05:26.859
alleviate her suffering.

05:26.859 --> 05:30.163
Besides, there's nothing good on TV.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.614
So I don't see any ring here.

05:32.115 --> 05:33.116
What gives, you guys, huh?

05:33.116 --> 05:36.119
Well, we're doing a little
window shopping. Yeah?

05:36.119 --> 05:38.004
But she's got her eye
on a big ol' diamond

05:38.004 --> 05:40.006
in the window of, uh,
Barton and Lyles. Yeah?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
Oh, no, no, Sam.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.510
Now that's much too expensive.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.512
I would be content with any one

05:46.512 --> 05:49.382
of the smaller stones we saw today.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.383
Oh, now wait a second.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.101
Hey, Woody, give me the
phone there, will ya?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.554
Listen, you might as
well have the best ring.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.055
You got the best husband.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.557
Hmm?

05:57.557 --> 06:00.059
Is it any wonder I love you?

06:00.059 --> 06:01.060
I'm twice blessed.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.062
I'm getting the most wonderful guy

06:03.062 --> 06:07.066
and one helluva rock.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.904
Yeah, let me, uh, let me find out

06:11.904 --> 06:13.906
just how much this thing is here.

06:13.906 --> 06:16.909
Yeah, find out there, Sammy.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.879
Hi, uh, you got a ring in
the window there by the door?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.381
It's a big diamond

06:21.381 --> 06:23.383
with two little diamonds
on either side there.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.384
Yeah, uh, that's the one.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
Yeah, how-how much does that cost?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.889
(laughs)

06:31.391 --> 06:32.759
How much?

06:32.759 --> 06:35.228
Fifty-two hundred.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.596
(all laughing)

06:36.596 --> 06:38.231
Boy, what am I going to do here?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.483
Bruce. What?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.934
Friend of mine in the jewelry business.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.270
He buys diamonds and gold wholesale

06:44.270 --> 06:45.738
and then you don't
have to pay the markup,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.106
which is like a zillion percent.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.858
Oh, you know, that-that's
kinda silly. No, no.

06:48.858 --> 06:50.610
It's the same gold, same diamonds.

06:51.861 --> 06:53.863
Well, if it's the same
ring, it's the same ring.

06:53.863 --> 06:54.864
Absolutely.

06:54.864 --> 06:56.365
Give me the phone. All right.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.618
Yeah, I'll call the
guy. Yeah, do it, do it.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.837
Uh, Sam, I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.622
Why not?

07:02.622 --> 07:04.624
Diane's not the kind of
woman who'd like to find out

07:04.624 --> 07:06.125
that her ring was bought from a jeweler

07:06.125 --> 07:09.128
who begins every transaction
with, "Psst, buddy."

07:10.096 --> 07:12.098
Oh, no, you make...

07:12.098 --> 07:14.100
you're makin' it sound worse than it is.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.352
I mean, I'm sure everything's legit.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.187
All right, fine, Bruce. Great.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.189
Psst, Sammy, come here.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.649
Dee-daa. Huh?

07:29.649 --> 07:32.151
Not bad for 1,200 bucks, huh?

07:32.151 --> 07:33.653
WOODY: Wow, I'll say.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.121
Hey, Carla, you, uh, see the ring

07:35.621 --> 07:36.622
that Sammy got for Diane here?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
You know, I'm thinking

07:38.124 --> 07:40.126
about having my house texture-coated.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.129
You have your choice
of 24 decorator colors.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.380
Amazing.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.166
Yeah, and surprisingly reasonable.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.167
SAM: Hey, hey, hey.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.169
Hey, you guys, you
want to see a classic?

07:50.169 --> 07:51.170
Here, watch.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.173
Hi, Diane. Hi, Sam.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.174
Oh boy, hey, you know,

07:55.174 --> 07:57.176
that finger looks a little warm there.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.562
Maybe you should cool
it down with some ice.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.013
(gasps): Sam.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.483
What? What? What's the
matter? What's wrong?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
Nothing.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.352
It's beautiful.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.237
Oh. Oh.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.740
Just think, hours ago,

08:10.740 --> 08:14.243
I was admiring this
magnificent ring in the window,

08:14.243 --> 08:18.247
thinking it was an
unattainable treasure.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.617
And now, here it is on my finger.

08:21.617 --> 08:22.952
Yep, there it is, all right.

08:22.952 --> 08:23.953
That's the one.

08:23.953 --> 08:25.338
How about that, huh?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Oh, thank you, thank you.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.840
Well, yeah... (chuckling)

08:28.341 --> 08:29.342
Thank you. Yeah.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.344
You're welcome.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.346
NORM: Hey, uh, Carla, do you realize

08:33.346 --> 08:35.298
that when Sammy and Diane get married,

08:35.298 --> 08:36.799
uh, Diane's going to be your boss?

08:36.799 --> 08:39.802
Nice shirt, Norm. Is it new?

08:41.437 --> 08:44.222
Sam...

08:44.222 --> 08:48.728
I felt that I couldn't
possibly ask you for this,

08:48.728 --> 08:51.731
but now that you've actually gone out

08:51.731 --> 08:54.233
and purchased it, I can tell you.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.736
This is the only ring I ever wanted.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.237
Mmm.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.740
Where's the box?

09:00.740 --> 09:02.742
Box?

09:02.742 --> 09:05.127
Yeah, you know, the one it came in.

09:05.127 --> 09:05.962
Oh, yeah, uh...

09:05.962 --> 09:07.463
this, this one didn't seem to come

09:07.463 --> 09:08.464
with one of those, did it?

09:13.970 --> 09:14.837
Really?

09:14.837 --> 09:17.173
Oh, I'm surprised they
didn't give you one,

09:17.173 --> 09:20.176
especially considering how
much this must have cost.

09:20.676 --> 09:21.677
Oh, well, they did, they did.

09:21.677 --> 09:23.179
It's just that I told
them, uh, keep the box.

09:23.179 --> 09:24.680
She'll just wear it.

09:27.183 --> 09:29.185
That's what I said, all right.

09:29.685 --> 09:30.570
(weak chuckle)

09:31.737 --> 09:33.689
Sam?

09:33.689 --> 09:34.574
Yeah.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.193
This may sound frivolous,

09:37.193 --> 09:39.028
but every woman wants to keep the box

09:39.028 --> 09:41.530
that her engagement ring came in.

09:41.530 --> 09:45.284
I already have a space reserved
for it in my memento drawer,

09:45.284 --> 09:48.087
right between my French
Club pin and my retainer.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.091
All right, all right.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.593
I mean, fine, honey,

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
I'll just, uh, go on,

09:55.595 --> 09:58.097
go back, and, uh... I'll get the box.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.599
CLIFF: Uh, don't forget
your receipt there, Sammy.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.719
Ah, they'll probably remember your face.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.352
You can relax, everybody.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.353
Got the box.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.354
NORM: All right, Sammy.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.855
They just, uh, gave it to ya, huh?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.357
No, no, I had to buy something.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.358
Oh, yeah?

10:25.358 --> 10:26.359
Wha, wha, what'd you get?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.744
Sterling silver corncob holders.

10:30.496 --> 10:31.497
290 bucks.

10:31.497 --> 10:32.865
Do you believe that?

10:32.865 --> 10:34.200
Wow. Why'd you buy those things?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.086
Well, everything else
seemed like such a rip-off.

10:38.921 --> 10:40.423
I'm still way ahead, though. It's okay.

10:40.423 --> 10:42.425
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

10:42.425 --> 10:43.926
Think about it.

10:43.926 --> 10:45.795
Oh, Sam, there you are.

10:45.795 --> 10:47.046
Yeah, and here you
are, my little darling.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.547
One ring box, just your size.

10:48.547 --> 10:49.548
How 'bout that, huh?

10:49.548 --> 10:50.049
You happy?

10:50.049 --> 10:51.550
Delirious.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.051
Oh, good.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.053
I just wish I'd gone with you

10:54.053 --> 10:55.554
when you went back to Barton and Lyles.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.057
I want to buy myself that dress.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.558
Oh, which dress is that?

10:59.558 --> 11:02.561
The one in the window.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.563
Right next door in Justine's window.

11:04.563 --> 11:05.564
Don't you remember?

11:05.564 --> 11:07.066
I was admiring it as we walked by.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.068
Oh, sure, sure, sure, yeah.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.069
Yeah... oh, it's perfect.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.070
I'd love it.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.072
Well, you know, it's kinda slack now.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.073
Why don't ya take off?

11:14.073 --> 11:14.573
Do a little shopping.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.076
Really? Yeah, go ahead.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.078
Oh, Sam. Uh.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.579
I'll get my purse.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.081
All right.

11:22.081 --> 11:22.581
So, uh, Sammy...

11:23.082 --> 11:24.083
when Diane sees the ring

11:24.083 --> 11:26.085
in the window of the fancy store

11:26.085 --> 11:27.086
and also on her finger,

11:27.086 --> 11:28.587
what do you think she'll say?

11:29.972 --> 11:31.173
Well, I'm off.

11:31.173 --> 11:34.143
Uh, no, Diane, uh, wait a second here.

11:34.143 --> 11:35.144
Uh, I can't...

11:35.144 --> 11:37.646
I can't let you go through with this.

11:37.646 --> 11:38.147
What?

11:38.147 --> 11:40.649
Well, uh, I, I bought

11:40.649 --> 11:42.651
that dress for ya.

11:42.651 --> 11:46.072
Sam Malone...

11:46.072 --> 11:47.073
Yeah.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.574
I don't believe you.

11:48.574 --> 11:49.575
No, it's a fact.

11:49.575 --> 11:50.576
It's in my car right up there.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.578
Oh, you scamp.

11:52.578 --> 11:53.446
Oh, go get it, please.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.914
Uh, you know, I...

11:54.914 --> 11:57.416
I was kinda hopin' to
surprise you with it.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.419
Well, I already know about it now.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.420
Right.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.422
What am I standin' here for then, huh?

12:03.422 --> 12:04.423
(laughing)

12:04.423 --> 12:05.424
Oh...

12:05.424 --> 12:06.425
Say, you know, that's, uh...

12:07.927 --> 12:10.429
that was such an interesting dress.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.931
How would you describe that color?

12:11.931 --> 12:12.932
Pink.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.934
Pink! Right.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.302
You always know the perfect word.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.219
Pink.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.472
Who woulda thought?

12:26.529 --> 12:28.531
I wonder what's keeping Sam.

12:28.531 --> 12:30.533
He's certainly been gone a long time.

12:30.533 --> 12:32.284
Where is Sam?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.622
"Where is Sam?"

12:36.622 --> 12:40.126
(quietly): I think she's starting
to relate to her environment again.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.077
FRASIER: Well, I think
we've made great progress.

12:42.077 --> 12:43.462
Carla,

12:43.462 --> 12:45.080
can you tell me who Sam is?

12:45.080 --> 12:47.249
Of course. He's my boss.

12:47.249 --> 12:50.052
Did you know that he is
now engaged to be married?

12:50.052 --> 12:52.004
Yes. I'm very happy for him.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.390
See how well we've done?

12:54.390 --> 12:56.892
Carla...

12:56.892 --> 13:01.764
who is the charming soul
that has agreed to marry him?

13:01.764 --> 13:03.149
Norm.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.604
Well, I'm not the miracle worker.

13:11.106 --> 13:13.108
Here we go.

13:14.610 --> 13:18.030
The one you wanted and, uh, three more.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.031
Oh, Sam!

13:19.031 --> 13:20.032
What?

13:20.032 --> 13:23.035
You impetuous fool. Oh, I love them.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.037
(chuckling): Oh. Oh, thank you.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.922
Uh-huh. Wait a minute.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.707
You were gone an awfully long time.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.593
I thought you were
just going to your car.

13:30.593 --> 13:33.045
Well, I got a-a parking ticket,

13:33.546 --> 13:36.432
and I, uh, I wanted
to fight it in court.

13:41.103 --> 13:43.856
Do I, uh, detect a snafu there, Sammy?

13:43.856 --> 13:46.525
Every damn dress in the window was pink.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.862
Oh, boy, that must have,
uh, cost you a pretty penny.

13:49.862 --> 13:50.863
That's all right.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.364
I'll get some of it back.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.233
She couldn't possibly
like all four of them.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.569
Oh, Sam, I love all of them.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.406
I can't decide which one
to wear tonight to dinner.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.374
Oh, go... oh, boy, uh, right.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.743
What did we say, uh, 7:00?

14:04.743 --> 14:06.662
Oh, could we make it a little later?

14:06.662 --> 14:09.665
I have to stop by the store
to get the ring appraised.

14:09.665 --> 14:11.550
Pardon me?

14:11.550 --> 14:14.553
The insurance man said

14:14.553 --> 14:17.056
that there has to be
an appraisal on file

14:17.056 --> 14:22.061
in order to have this
covered in my theft policy.

14:22.061 --> 14:25.564
Boy, they, uh... they
don't make it easy, do they?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.267
Uh, I'll tell you what.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.768
Why don't you, uh, let me handle that?

14:29.768 --> 14:30.769
I'll have it appraised.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.771
Uh, why... yeah, why
don't you give me the ring?

14:32.771 --> 14:34.273
Oh, no, Sam!

14:34.273 --> 14:37.276
Just as our love is
forever, so is this ring.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.777
From here on out,

14:38.777 --> 14:40.663
it will never leave my finger.

14:40.663 --> 14:42.781
Beautiful.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.583
That's really beautiful.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.586
Woody, you want to get
me some aspirin there?

14:48.587 --> 14:50.456
Sam, I think this has gone too far.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.791
You're caught in a quagmire of deceit.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.793
You're just going to
sink deeper and deeper,

14:54.793 --> 14:55.794
and to what avail?

14:55.794 --> 14:57.796
To my butt's avail.

15:00.799 --> 15:01.800
Yeah, maybe you're right.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.801
Maybe I should just...

15:02.801 --> 15:04.803
bite the bullet and be honest with her.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.806
I mean, I really want
this relationship to work.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.191
We do, too, Sammy.

15:10.893 --> 15:13.145
Uh, Diane?

15:13.145 --> 15:15.147
Yes.

15:15.147 --> 15:16.615
I, uh, I have something
I want to say to you.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.617
Uh, I'm afraid you're
not going to like it.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.120
After receiving this...

15:21.120 --> 15:24.123
beautiful symbol of
our relationship--

15:24.123 --> 15:26.625
a symbol that has
touched me very deeply--

15:26.625 --> 15:31.130
nothing you say could
ever disappoint me.

15:31.130 --> 15:31.997
What is it?

15:33.465 --> 15:36.585
I have to go to the doctor.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.972
What for? No, it's nothing serious.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.473
It's, uh...

15:41.473 --> 15:42.474
I just figured that, you know,

15:42.474 --> 15:43.475
we-we're getting married.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.977
Uh, I might as well have a check-up

15:44.977 --> 15:48.981
and make sure the old
Evinrude's still cranking.

15:48.981 --> 15:52.484
I don't see any cause for alarm in that.

15:52.484 --> 15:53.485
No.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.854
In fact, I think it's quite sensible.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.072
Good, good.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.023
I love the dresses.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.024
Oh, me, too.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.409
Thanks so much.

16:00.409 --> 16:01.860
Lovely.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.363
So, uh, what now, Kemo Sammy?

16:05.864 --> 16:07.366
It's no problem. It's no problem.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.367
I'll just, uh... I'll
go back to the store

16:08.367 --> 16:11.370
and I'll... I'll handle it.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.872
Tell you, though... no way in the world

16:13.872 --> 16:15.758
am I going to buy that expensive ring.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.677
The ring is bought. Oh, yeah.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.557
CLIFF: Oh, you shelled out

16:31.557 --> 16:33.942
for the ring in the
window, didn't you, Sammy?

16:34.777 --> 16:36.028
Yeah.

16:36.028 --> 16:36.862
Uh-huh.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.732
I got a real interesting price on it.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.399
Full price?

16:40.399 --> 16:42.151
Right around there, yeah.

16:43.402 --> 16:46.905
As soon as I switch this one
for the... ring on her finger,

16:46.905 --> 16:49.291
my problems are over.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.077
Oh, Sam, what did the doctor say?

16:52.077 --> 16:55.047
Same thing he always does: "Wow!"

17:00.636 --> 17:02.638
But you're fine, yes?

17:02.638 --> 17:04.138
SAM: Oh, yeah, no problem there.

17:04.138 --> 17:05.641
No, uh...

17:05.641 --> 17:07.009
You know, actually, I-I was sitting

17:07.009 --> 17:08.894
in the, uh, waiting room there,

17:08.894 --> 17:09.895
and I, uh, realized that, uh,

17:09.895 --> 17:12.397
I had never officially put

17:12.897 --> 17:14.400
that ring on your finger, and I'd...

17:14.400 --> 17:15.901
well, I'd kind of like to.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.905
Sam, you're just
sweeping me off my feet.

17:19.905 --> 17:23.409
Um, okay, well, uh, close your eyes.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.410
Why?

17:24.410 --> 17:25.911
Uh, well, there, uh...

17:25.911 --> 17:27.413
there-there's something
I want to say to you,

17:27.913 --> 17:28.914
and, uh, I might get embarrassed

17:28.914 --> 17:31.917
if-if you saw me... say it.

17:31.917 --> 17:32.918
Okay.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.920
All right. I can't wait to hear this.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.422
Right...

17:39.258 --> 17:43.762
Diane... you're really neat.

17:47.382 --> 17:50.135
I think this big step we've taken

17:50.135 --> 17:52.137
has made you positively goofy.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.538
Well, maybe it has.

17:53.639 --> 17:54.890
That's me-- just
one big goof.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.726
(chuckles)

17:57.726 --> 17:59.728
Yeah, they, uh... they
haven't found a chick

17:59.728 --> 18:01.230
that can outsmart me.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.232
All right, Sammy.

18:03.232 --> 18:06.652
Did he say "chick" or "chimp"?

18:08.537 --> 18:10.372
(phone ringing)

18:12.875 --> 18:14.376
Cheers.

18:15.327 --> 18:18.330
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.833
Norman is uncharacteristically absent.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.336
May I... take a message for him?

18:24.336 --> 18:25.838
Uh-huh.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.340
Bruce wants to know about the ring?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.843
Mm-hmm.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.847
Uh-huh...

18:35.848 --> 18:38.350
Yes, I think it's safe to say

18:38.350 --> 18:43.355
that Sam's fiancée was
completely fooled by it.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.870
Boy, I'm starved.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.373
I hear it's a great restaurant.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.382
You're quite the little
chatterbox tonight.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.851
Oh, you want me to talk?

19:12.851 --> 19:15.354
Well, it's not necessary.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.355
Fine, I'll talk.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.856
I don't appreciate

19:17.856 --> 19:20.359
being given junk jewelry

19:20.359 --> 19:21.860
and then lied to about it.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.863
Oh, now, wait a second, that
is not junk jewelry, Diane.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.366
Oh, Sam, please, no more lies.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.367
How could you pledge

19:28.367 --> 19:30.869
your troth with a paste ring?

19:30.869 --> 19:31.870
Oh, that is not a paste ring!

19:31.870 --> 19:32.871
All right, all right, there was...

19:32.871 --> 19:33.872
there was another ring.

19:33.872 --> 19:34.873
I... but I switched it

19:34.873 --> 19:35.874
for the one in the window.

19:35.874 --> 19:36.875
I swear to God I did, Diane!

19:36.875 --> 19:38.877
Oh, please, don't bother swearing.

19:38.877 --> 19:40.379
You have no idea what this day has...

19:40.379 --> 19:42.381
I know this obviously
means nothing to you.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.383
I'd rather go without than wear a lie.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.384
SAM: No, no, no!

19:45.384 --> 19:49.388
(tires screeching) (crashing)

19:50.889 --> 19:55.477
Explain that part about
switching rings again.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.648
Oh, there's something shiny!

19:59.648 --> 20:04.069
No. Just another paper wrapper.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.572
(sighs)

20:07.573 --> 20:11.076
Oh, look at us. We're filthy.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.579
Yeah.

20:13.579 --> 20:17.082
By the way, I hate that dress.

20:19.534 --> 20:23.038
Considering the circumstances
under which it was obtained,

20:23.038 --> 20:25.540
it's hardly one of my favorites anymore.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.542
Okay.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.044
Then I can count on you not wearing it

20:29.044 --> 20:30.545
when you visit me in the poorhouse

20:30.545 --> 20:32.047
that you put me in.

20:32.047 --> 20:34.549
Oh, Sam, get off it.

20:35.550 --> 20:36.551
No, no, no, wait a second.

20:36.551 --> 20:38.937
Le-Let's tally up the damages here.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.357
The first ring was $1,200.

20:42.357 --> 20:44.860
The box was $290.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.865
Four lovely pink frocks was a mere $950.

20:49.865 --> 20:51.783
The, uh, damages on the car

20:51.783 --> 20:53.285
will be at least a grand.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.787
And let's not forget
about the $5,200 bite

20:55.787 --> 20:58.073
I was hoping to avoid
in the first place.

20:58.073 --> 21:03.078
Bringing it to a grand
total of $9,000...

21:03.078 --> 21:06.081
for a ring I no longer have.

21:06.081 --> 21:09.584
Well, I hasten to add that this
was all of your own volition.

21:09.584 --> 21:10.585
SAM: Ah...

21:13.088 --> 21:15.090
$290 for the box?

21:15.090 --> 21:16.425
Yeah.

21:17.426 --> 21:19.311
Do you like... do you
like corn on the cob?

21:23.315 --> 21:27.653
Well, I guess I'm just stupid to think

21:27.653 --> 21:29.604
that I could make someone like you happy

21:29.604 --> 21:33.108
on a budget of someone like me.

21:37.612 --> 21:38.113
I'm sorry.

21:38.613 --> 21:39.614
Well, you should be.

21:42.117 --> 21:46.121
All right, I said I was!

21:47.122 --> 21:49.624
Give me a bit of slack.

21:51.626 --> 21:54.129
(sighs)

21:54.129 --> 21:59.634
Even... had that been
the... bargain ring,

21:59.634 --> 22:00.635
it would've been

22:00.635 --> 22:03.638
sinfully impetuous
of me to cast it away.

22:04.139 --> 22:06.641
Well, here's the bargain ring right now.

22:06.641 --> 22:10.145
Why don't you give it
the old heave-ho, too?

22:10.145 --> 22:12.614
Hmm...

22:12.614 --> 22:14.616
Hmm.

22:14.616 --> 22:18.120
I'm somehow reminded of a fable penned

22:18.120 --> 22:22.624
by an anonymous 18th century author...

22:22.624 --> 22:25.627
concerning the young mistress

22:25.627 --> 22:27.546
of a great feudal estate

22:27.546 --> 22:29.965
and a woodchopper who
worked on the estate...

22:29.965 --> 22:34.920
Diane... not now, please?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.426
Could I just tell you the moral?

22:41.426 --> 22:43.929
What?

22:43.929 --> 22:46.431
You're really neat.

22:52.904 --> 22:56.408
Hardly a rich soul, I know.

22:56.408 --> 22:59.411
The fact remains that...

22:59.411 --> 23:02.330
no matter what the cost...

23:02.330 --> 23:06.368
a ring is, above all else,

23:06.368 --> 23:07.869
a symbol of the feelings

23:07.869 --> 23:12.374
that two people have for each other.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.879
So, truly, Sam, this is the ring I want.

23:17.879 --> 23:21.383
Whoa, whoa, whoa, here.

23:22.384 --> 23:24.886
Let me do this.

23:24.886 --> 23:27.389
Uh...

23:31.393 --> 23:34.396
But nothing says we can't keep looking.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.627
(screaming): No!
