08:45.926 --> 08:47.561
to protect some guy
I don't even give a shit about.

08:47.612 --> 08:48.562
Now are you on board
with that?

08:48.613 --> 08:50.063
I'm on board.
Can we move on?

08:50.114 --> 08:52.065
- I have nothing to move on to.
- I do.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.234
Have you called Scottie
and apologized yet?

08:54.285 --> 08:55.285
Apologize for what?

08:55.370 --> 08:56.737
What are you,
the apology police?

08:56.788 --> 08:58.038
If you're the one
under investigation,

08:58.105 --> 08:59.323
I'll sign up for that.

08:59.407 --> 09:02.242
Jessica, if you need me
to sign any more checks,

09:02.293 --> 09:03.443
now would be a great time.
It's Louis.

09:03.494 --> 09:04.661
Let me guess.

09:04.746 --> 09:06.129
Even though he didn't
show up to the meeting,

09:06.214 --> 09:07.914
he's feeling left out
and throwing a hissy fit.

09:07.966 --> 09:10.950
He had a heart attack
in court this morning.

09:15.089 --> 09:17.341
Oh, my God.

09:17.425 --> 09:18.842
He's okay.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.628
I made a call, he's got the best
cardiologists at Mount Sinai,

09:21.679 --> 09:23.797
and they say
he's going to be fine.

09:23.848 --> 09:26.733
We should go see him.

09:26.801 --> 09:28.402
He told Norma
he didn't want anybody to come.

09:28.469 --> 09:31.971
That means he's embarrassed,
but he wants me there.

09:32.023 --> 09:36.159
I'll be back
when I'm back.

09:38.413 --> 09:40.414
We handle
all his cases personally.

09:40.481 --> 09:43.000
Nothing with Louis' name on it
falls through the cracks.

09:43.084 --> 09:45.419
No client finds out
this happened.

09:45.486 --> 09:47.337
- Done.
- Done.

09:47.422 --> 09:49.873
I'll send him flowers
from all of us.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.425
No.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.377
He's allergic.

09:53.461 --> 09:55.379
To flowers?

09:55.463 --> 09:56.880
All of them?

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
How do you even know that?

09:58.850 --> 10:00.851
I used to send them
to his desk every day

10:00.935 --> 10:02.335
when we were associates.

10:02.387 --> 10:04.187
I know.

10:04.272 --> 10:06.473
I'm an asshole.

10:06.524 --> 10:09.026
Hey.
He's gonna be okay, right?

10:13.147 --> 10:14.698
Oh, my God.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.850
This is awful.

10:16.901 --> 10:19.369
Yeah, I know.

10:19.454 --> 10:20.854
All morning all I've been
thinking about is how

10:20.905 --> 10:22.856
I don't want to talk to him
about the tuition, and now--

10:22.907 --> 10:25.625
Hey, Rachel, Rachel.
Hey, come on.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.193
Look at me.

10:27.245 --> 10:29.296
He's gonna be okay.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.048
He'll be back, and you guys
can have a lifetime

10:31.132 --> 10:34.200
of working together,
going to the ballet,

10:34.252 --> 10:36.586
having really awkward
conversations.

10:36.671 --> 10:39.589
[Chuckles, sighs]

10:39.674 --> 10:40.874
Rachel,
I'm gonna say the thing

10:40.875 --> 10:42.041
that I know
you don't want to hear.

10:42.093 --> 10:43.643
I don't care
about that right now.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.595
It doesn't have to be
a big deal.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.397
We've all got Louis' back
right now,

10:47.482 --> 10:49.182
and Jessica handles
this stuff anyway.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.485
Just talk to her.

10:53.654 --> 10:58.191
You are never allowed
to have a heart attack.

10:59.911 --> 11:01.611
Okay?

11:03.114 --> 11:05.031
Understood.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.839
Louis.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.427
Is this heaven?

11:17.512 --> 11:20.680
I can understand
why you would think that,

11:20.748 --> 11:21.765
but no.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.050
I don't know
how this can happen.

11:24.102 --> 11:28.388
I...Treat my body
like a temple.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.690
And you've also been
commuting every weekend,

11:30.758 --> 11:32.838
and you let the associates
raise your blood pressure.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.428
- It's because they're stupid.
- Okay, Louis, relax.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.530
The doctors say
you're out of danger,

11:36.597 --> 11:37.948
but you shouldn't
get worked up.

11:38.032 --> 11:40.534
- The doctors need to let me go.
- You had a heart attack.

11:40.601 --> 11:43.286
If my blood supply had been
cut off for a half-second less,

11:43.371 --> 11:46.156
it would've been classified
as a minor cardiac event.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.941
And what if it would have
lasted half a second more?

11:47.992 --> 11:48.942
It didn't.

11:48.993 --> 11:50.710
And I need to get to work.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.046
Louis, I'm serious.
You have to cut back.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.664
You could have died.

11:54.749 --> 11:57.050
And if anything
were to happen to you...

12:02.807 --> 12:06.510
Harvey would be a total mess.
Okay?

12:09.597 --> 12:11.798
I'll cut back.

12:11.849 --> 12:13.733
Good.

12:18.622 --> 12:21.340
Excuse me.
It's Mike, right?

12:21.424 --> 12:22.875
Yeah. Did you
still need something?

12:22.959 --> 12:24.760
Because I haven't
finished yet.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.961
I did. I've been
trying to find Louis.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.212
He wasn't at the meeting.

12:27.297 --> 12:29.348
- Louis isn't here.
- Where is he?

12:29.432 --> 12:32.468
What did you need
to see him about?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.436
I want to talk
about what happened.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.856
Yeah, um, look,
I know that we both agreed

12:37.941 --> 12:39.642
that a spin-off
was the better way to go, but--

12:39.709 --> 12:41.860
I don't want
to talk about that.

12:41.945 --> 12:43.028
I want to talk about me.

12:43.113 --> 12:44.363
I want out.

12:44.447 --> 12:45.568
You want to leave
Gianopolous

12:45.615 --> 12:46.848
because of what happened
this morning?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.283
What happened this morning
happens every day.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.203
He keeps people down
when they reach a certain point,

12:51.287 --> 12:53.155
and I'm pretty sure
I'm at that point.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.540
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.

12:54.624 --> 12:56.024
You don't. No.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.210
In a place like this, your whole
future's laid out for you.

12:58.294 --> 13:00.462
You'll be running
the place before 40.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.214
[Chuckles]

13:02.298 --> 13:05.250
Jonathan, we work
for Tony Gianopolous.

13:05.335 --> 13:06.535
And I know I don't
have to tell you,

13:06.586 --> 13:07.970
but you're working
under the same non-compete

13:08.037 --> 13:09.421
that William Beck is.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.924
But you work for me too.
Louis is my personal attorney.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.058
I know.

13:13.143 --> 13:14.760
But if there's
a conflict of interest,

13:14.844 --> 13:16.929
we're gonna choose him.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.847
I know
that you have a conflict.

13:18.898 --> 13:19.881
I'm just asking,
is there any way

13:19.933 --> 13:21.717
that you can help me
without...

13:21.768 --> 13:23.719
Helping me?

13:23.770 --> 13:26.655
I'm sorry.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.890
Then where's Louis?

13:28.942 --> 13:29.942
Louis is away
on business right now,

13:30.026 --> 13:32.060
so he can't help you either.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.579
Then I'll find
someone who will.

13:33.663 --> 13:37.065
Let this serve as formal notice
I'm letting him go.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.085
Michigan Court of Appeals.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.454
What?

13:42.539 --> 13:44.089
There was a ruling
a few years ago

13:44.174 --> 13:48.460
that established a weak link
in the non-compete.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:58.471 --> 14:00.606
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Do you have a minute?

14:00.690 --> 14:01.974
What can I do for you?

14:02.058 --> 14:05.194
The timing on this
is terrible,

14:05.261 --> 14:06.812
and I-I apologize for that.

14:06.896 --> 14:09.598
What is it?

14:09.649 --> 14:11.950
I need the first check
for my law school tuition.

14:12.035 --> 14:13.435
Excuse me?

14:13.486 --> 14:16.488
Maybe you don't remember, but
when I was wrongfully dismissed,

14:16.573 --> 14:18.106
one of the terms
of my rehiring

14:18.158 --> 14:19.958
was that the firm
pays for my law school.

14:20.043 --> 14:21.794
I remember just fine.

14:21.878 --> 14:23.328
And the only term
of your rehiring

14:23.413 --> 14:25.297
was a 10% increase
in salary.

14:25.381 --> 14:28.116
What?

14:28.168 --> 14:31.670
No, I'm--I'm telling you this
was an agreed-upon term, and--

14:31.755 --> 14:34.223
And I'm telling you
I know nothing about that.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.459
And if I had heard about it,
I would have never approved it.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.628
I was scapegoated
by this firm.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.396
And when you agreed
to come back,

14:41.464 --> 14:42.898
you were given a 10% raise.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.066
That's standard.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.734
My situation
was not standard.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.904
In what way?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.323
Louis accused me
of being disloyal.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.242
And?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.160
And he turned out
to be wrong.

14:55.245 --> 14:56.495
The problem, Rachel,

14:56.579 --> 15:01.200
is that you have no record
of what you're saying.

15:01.284 --> 15:02.918
He agreed to it.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.320
He is your agent.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.339
You're bound by this.

15:07.423 --> 15:08.757
I don't know that.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.425
And the man just had
a heart attack.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.011
And I'm not going
to call him and ask him.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.713
I know that,
and I don't want you to.

15:14.798 --> 15:17.549
Then this conversation
is over.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.479
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.364
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

15:32.448 --> 15:34.116
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sheila.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.851
I'm so sorry.
You should be.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.018
I don't know
why I had a heart attack,

15:37.070 --> 15:38.620
but I promise
it won't happen again.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.524
You think I'm mad
because you had a heart attack?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.255
It's a sign of weakness.
You hate weakness.

15:44.327 --> 15:45.648
No, I hate
that you're doing work.

15:45.662 --> 15:47.079
- Sheila--
- No, Louis,

15:47.163 --> 15:49.298
do you know what I was thinking
about the whole way down here?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.533
I was thinking
that if you died,

15:51.584 --> 15:53.368
I'd want to die too.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.636
So you better start
taking care of yourself,

15:54.704 --> 15:55.804
because I don't want to--

15:55.872 --> 15:58.056
- Sheila--
- No. No more work.

15:58.141 --> 15:59.207
Okay, but this isn't
what you think it is.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.592
Don't fight me
on this, please.

16:00.677 --> 16:02.060
- Okay, but I need that--
- Don't fight me on this!

16:02.145 --> 16:06.214
"Sheila, as long
as I've known you, I've had a...

16:06.266 --> 16:08.216
"I've had a feeling
of completeness.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.818
[Sighs]

16:09.886 --> 16:13.155
Romeo and Juliet.
Antony and Cleopatra."

16:13.222 --> 16:15.107
You crossed out
Jaime and Cersei Lannister.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.032
I thought they were
too controversial a couple.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.278
- Too controversial for what?
- A proposal.

16:19.362 --> 16:21.997
What?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.582
Sheila, I could've died.

16:23.666 --> 16:26.585
And I don't want my life
to have ended without--

16:26.669 --> 16:27.736
Louis, I don't want you to ask
me what you're about to ask me

16:27.787 --> 16:29.237
because you're afraid
to die alone.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.239
No.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.258
It's not about that.

16:36.512 --> 16:40.716
It's not about dying alone.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.602
It's about living
without the woman I love.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.692
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

16:50.760 --> 16:53.979
you are the love
of what I hope will be

16:54.063 --> 16:57.816
my very, very long life.

16:57.901 --> 17:01.269
And I can't spend one more
second of it without you.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.159
Will you marry me?

17:07.242 --> 17:09.778
Yes.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.998
Yes, I'll marry you.

17:22.892 --> 17:26.127
Tony,
what can I do for you?

17:26.179 --> 17:28.230
You screwed me over.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.965
By figuring out how to fire
the guy you told us to fire?

17:30.016 --> 17:33.134
By telling my number two
how to break his non-compete.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.306
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Then it was Louis Litt.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.190
No way.
That did not happen.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.942
That's bullshit, Harvey,
we had a meeting.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.810
Jonathan stuck around
for the paperwork.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.413
Then suddenly he comes back
with his resignation

17:44.480 --> 17:46.248
and some Michigan
Appeals Court precedent

17:46.315 --> 17:47.649
for breaking our deal.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.834
Well, he couldn't have
met with Louis

17:48.918 --> 17:50.168
because Louis wasn't even
in the office.

17:50.253 --> 17:51.503
Then it was someone else.

17:51.587 --> 17:52.787
Tony, what exactly
do you want?

17:52.789 --> 17:54.373
You want me to fire him
like we're firing Beck?

17:54.457 --> 17:56.341
I'll tell you
a little secret.

17:56.426 --> 17:59.094
I don't give a shit
whether Beck goes or not.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.346
But can you understand
why I want him crushed?

18:01.431 --> 18:03.215
Because you want
people like Jonathan Sidwell

18:03.299 --> 18:05.100
to know what happens
when they try to leave.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.101
Ah.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.169
Finally my lawyer shows up.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.356
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

18:11.441 --> 18:13.358
You see it
how you want to see it.

18:13.443 --> 18:15.727
But if you can't figure out
a way to make Jonathan stay,

18:15.812 --> 18:18.647
you'll be the one who's gone.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.065
Tony.

18:20.149 --> 18:23.952
I'm gonna fix this,
but let's get one thing clear.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.821
I'm not like the other lawyers
you've burned through.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.823
So the next time
you go stomping around

18:27.874 --> 18:30.709
like a four-year-old
throwing tantrums with me,

18:30.793 --> 18:33.996
I'll be the one
getting rid of you.

18:39.482 --> 18:42.020
 I guess you were
never really onboard after all.

18:42.359 --> 18:45.545
What?
I did the paperwork for Beck.

18:45.629 --> 18:46.710
I'm not talking about Beck.

18:46.747 --> 18:48.247
I'm talking
about Jonathan Sidwell.

18:48.332 --> 18:50.299
Michigan Court of Appeals
sound familiar?

18:50.367 --> 18:52.251
[Sighs]

18:52.336 --> 18:53.869
Harvey,
he was gonna fire Louis.

18:53.921 --> 18:56.038
If that's the advice
he was looking for from Louis,

18:56.090 --> 18:57.373
he'd have fired him anyway.

18:57.424 --> 18:58.725
And Jonathan would've
found that loophole anyway.

18:58.809 --> 19:00.176
But instead
he got it from you.

19:00.227 --> 19:02.227
What do you want from me?
Louis had a heart attack.

19:02.262 --> 19:04.764
Jessica told us not to--
don't hide behind that shit.

19:04.848 --> 19:06.149
Let's get
into what this is really about.

19:06.216 --> 19:07.716
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:07.768 --> 19:09.235
I'm talking about
your conversation with Jessica.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.887
So that's why you were
telling me my idea was so good

19:11.939 --> 19:15.408
after our Gianopolous meeting.

19:15.492 --> 19:16.859
Yeah.
We had that conversation.

19:16.910 --> 19:18.327
And yeah, it sucks.

19:18.395 --> 19:20.329
But this has nothing
to do with that.

19:20.397 --> 19:21.564
- Then prove it.
- Prove what?

19:21.615 --> 19:23.166
He's unhappy
with his situation.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.900
When people are unhappy,
they find a way out.

19:24.952 --> 19:26.285
Which brings me
back to my point.

19:26.370 --> 19:28.121
You weren't really on board.

19:28.205 --> 19:30.256
I told you,
I took care of Beck.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.624
Well, now you're gonna
do the same for Jonathan.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.409
The Michigan ruling
clearly states that he has--

19:33.460 --> 19:34.761
Don't quote precedent to me.

19:34.845 --> 19:37.096
You figured out how he could
break the non-compete,

19:37.181 --> 19:38.798
now figure out
how to enforce it.

19:38.882 --> 19:40.266
- Harvey--
- Enough.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.517
You're a pretty good lawyer
when you want to be,

19:41.585 --> 19:44.637
so maybe try doing it
for our side this time.

19:53.397 --> 19:54.480
Bad night?

19:54.565 --> 19:56.783
Only if you call
figuring out a way

19:56.867 --> 19:59.285
to crush
someone's hopes and dreams bad.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.769
What about you?

20:00.821 --> 20:04.207
You, uh, take care
of that awkward conversation?

20:04.274 --> 20:09.078
Yeah, it wasn't awkward.
It was...

20:09.129 --> 20:12.215
Humiliating.

20:12.282 --> 20:13.833
Louis never
actually told Jessica.

20:13.917 --> 20:16.385
What?
That's bullshit.

20:16.453 --> 20:18.721
He made a promise to you.
He's an agent of the firm.

20:18.788 --> 20:20.089
You know,
I never thought about that.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.641
Maybe I should just
rush to his hospital bed

20:21.725 --> 20:23.676
and get him to admit
that he screwed me over.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.345
[Sighs]

20:26.430 --> 20:28.848
How could he
lie to me like that?

20:28.932 --> 20:30.733
Rachel, why he lied
to you doesn't matter.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.469
- It matters to me.
- Well, you said it yourself.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.238
Do you really want
to upset him just to find out?

20:35.305 --> 20:36.272
Of course not.

20:36.323 --> 20:37.740
Then take the emotion
out of it.

20:37.807 --> 20:40.910
- What are you talking about?
- It's a contract problem.

20:40.977 --> 20:43.696
Figure out a way
to enforce the contract.

20:49.286 --> 20:51.654
I have someone
here to see you.

20:51.705 --> 20:54.874
Donna, I don't have time
to see anyone right--

20:54.958 --> 20:56.878
oh, look who it is.
Where the hell have you been?

20:56.927 --> 20:59.095
Harvey, don't be a dick.
He had a heart attack.

20:59.162 --> 21:00.996
And you think
having a heart attack

21:01.048 --> 21:03.883
gives you the right
to take the day off?

21:07.221 --> 21:09.856
I'm alive.
[Chuckles]

21:09.940 --> 21:11.858
[Quietly]
Help me.

21:11.942 --> 21:14.193
[Quietly]
Hug him back.

21:18.782 --> 21:20.316
I'm gonna let you two
be alone.

21:20.367 --> 21:24.237
Okay, not that I'm not
enjoying this, but...

21:24.321 --> 21:25.521
Shouldn't you be home?

21:25.572 --> 21:28.023
No, the doctor cleared me
to come back.

21:28.075 --> 21:29.492
Sheila's allowing me
half days.

21:29.543 --> 21:31.711
The other half of the day...

21:31.795 --> 21:33.212
I'm at home
planning my wedding.

21:33.297 --> 21:34.697
You're engaged?

21:34.748 --> 21:36.582
It's the happiest moment
of my life.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.701
I'll send my condolences
to the bride-to-be.

21:38.752 --> 21:40.169
That kind of sense of humor

21:40.220 --> 21:41.420
is exactly what I want
of my best man.

21:41.505 --> 21:43.145
Louis, are you asking me
to be your best--

21:43.206 --> 21:45.708
Harvey, before you answer,

21:45.759 --> 21:48.210
I am sorry my fight with Scottie
put you in a bad situation.

21:48.262 --> 21:50.396
And I know calling in
my chit with you

21:50.480 --> 21:51.801
jeopardized our friendship,
but...

21:51.848 --> 21:53.215
- Louis--
- Let me just finish.

21:53.267 --> 21:56.319
You said I can't
have it both ways, but--

21:56.386 --> 21:58.487
I'd be honored.

22:01.191 --> 22:02.558
Thank you, Harvey.

22:02.609 --> 22:04.777
You're welcome, Louis.

22:13.370 --> 22:15.922
- Mr. Kovacs.
- Yes?

22:16.006 --> 22:18.507
Mike Ross.
Pearson Specter.

22:18.575 --> 22:19.842
Do we have business
together?

22:19.909 --> 22:21.427
Jonathan Sidwell.

22:21.511 --> 22:22.832
I understand
you made him an offer

22:22.879 --> 22:24.347
to run
your investment division.

22:24.414 --> 22:27.516
Jonathan reached out to me
with a proposal, and I liked it.

22:27.584 --> 22:28.517
Did he happen
to mention the fact

22:28.585 --> 22:29.518
that he's under a non-compete?

22:29.586 --> 22:30.586
Yes.

22:30.637 --> 22:31.854
He also mentioned that

22:31.921 --> 22:33.401
the Michigan Court
of Appeals decision

22:33.423 --> 22:34.923
makes his contract breakable.

22:34.975 --> 22:37.109
I had my lawyers look into it.
He's right.

22:37.194 --> 22:38.427
Did you also have
your lawyers

22:38.478 --> 22:40.429
look into the theft
of intellectual property?

22:40.480 --> 22:41.614
What are you talking about?

22:41.698 --> 22:43.098
I'm talking
about the algorithm

22:43.150 --> 22:44.367
that Jonathan developed
to identify

22:44.434 --> 22:45.785
companies ripe for takeover.

22:45.869 --> 22:48.037
- My employee, my algorithm.
- Wrong.

22:48.104 --> 22:50.156
Jonathan developed it
while under contract

22:50.240 --> 22:54.777
with Tony Gianopolous,
which makes it his property.

22:54.828 --> 22:57.496
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

22:57.581 --> 22:58.614
I just came down here

22:58.665 --> 22:59.966
to let you know
you can go ahead

23:00.050 --> 23:01.334
and do whatever you care to
with Jonathan Sidwell,

23:01.418 --> 23:03.552
but if you use
his algorithm,

23:03.620 --> 23:07.506
we're gonna sue you for
every penny that comes from it.

23:15.649 --> 23:16.983
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.300
I heard you were back.

23:18.352 --> 23:20.302
Should you be doing that?
Prescribed.

23:20.354 --> 23:23.022
Light walking.
Need to get the blood flowing.

23:23.106 --> 23:24.857
Okay.

23:24.941 --> 23:26.742
Good.

23:26.810 --> 23:28.411
Look, Louis, I am--

23:28.478 --> 23:30.363
I'm sorry about what happened.
I really am.

23:30.447 --> 23:32.531
Well, I'm gonna
be fine, Rachel.

23:32.616 --> 23:33.866
Good.

23:33.950 --> 23:36.669
I actually wanted to talk to you
about a contracts issue.

23:36.753 --> 23:39.488
- Shoot.
- Okay.

23:39.539 --> 23:41.419
A friend of mine
entered into a verbal agreement

23:41.458 --> 23:44.660
with an agent for a corporation,
and now he's reneging on it.

23:44.711 --> 23:46.045
Wait a second, why verbal?

23:46.129 --> 23:47.380
Why not?

23:47.464 --> 23:48.881
Verbal contracts are binding,
and she knows it.

23:48.965 --> 23:50.933
She have it on tape?
No.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.502
Well, then he can lie about
it, or he can argue the wording.

23:53.553 --> 23:55.221
No, he made a clear promise.

23:55.305 --> 23:57.172
Well, maybe it was
a promise to try,

23:57.224 --> 24:00.359
or maybe it was a suggestion.
No, it wasn't.

24:02.479 --> 24:03.779
What's the contract?

24:03.847 --> 24:05.531
Employment bonus.

24:05.615 --> 24:07.116
Lump sum
or payable over time?

24:07.183 --> 24:09.184
- Three-year term.
- Well, then verbal ain't shit.

24:09.236 --> 24:12.705
If it's paid over a year
or more, it has to be written.

24:12.789 --> 24:14.540
My friend made life decisions
based on this promise.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.692
She could sue
for promissory estoppel.

24:16.743 --> 24:17.693
Well, she could sue
the dick who made the deal,

24:17.744 --> 24:19.078
but she can't sue the company.

24:19.162 --> 24:21.247
- She doesn't want to do that.
- Let me ask you this.

24:21.331 --> 24:24.050
Why wouldn't she get it
in writing if it was legit?

24:24.134 --> 24:26.702
Because she trusted him.

24:26.753 --> 24:28.804
She doesn't know
why he would lie to her.

24:28.872 --> 24:30.423
He did because he could.

24:30.507 --> 24:32.725
He wanted what he wanted
when he wanted it,

24:32.809 --> 24:34.977
and it cost him nothing.

24:35.044 --> 24:36.479
You know?
Yeah.

24:36.546 --> 24:39.315
Maybe she should go after him.
She could try.

24:39.382 --> 24:40.516
But I mean, realistically,
she'll lose, and she should,

24:40.567 --> 24:43.069
because stupidity
shouldn't be rewarded.

24:43.153 --> 24:46.221
So glad you came to see me.
You really got my juices going.

24:46.273 --> 24:47.239
Make me feel glad to be back.

24:47.324 --> 24:49.442
[Chuckles]

24:53.029 --> 24:57.416
- This is nice, fiance.
- It is nice, betrothed.

24:57.501 --> 24:59.735
So where should we do it?

24:59.786 --> 25:02.588
Sheila, are you serious?
I just had a heart attack.

25:02.672 --> 25:05.174
I'm talking
about the wedding.

25:05.241 --> 25:07.009
I say we do it here.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.595
Get married in New York?

25:09.679 --> 25:12.214
It's where
our relationship began.

25:12.265 --> 25:15.518
I think it's only fitting
that we tie the knot here.

25:15.585 --> 25:17.970
I love you.

25:18.054 --> 25:20.222
Good, then it's decided.

25:20.273 --> 25:21.590
We'll do it here

25:21.641 --> 25:23.359
and then move
straight to Boston.

25:23.426 --> 25:24.810
What do you mean
move to Boston?

25:24.895 --> 25:26.278
I'm not moving to Boston.

25:26.363 --> 25:29.198
You have to. You know
what Harvard means to me.

25:29.265 --> 25:31.617
You know what
Pearson Specter means to me.

25:31.701 --> 25:32.952
Okay, Louis,
there are a dozen firms

25:33.036 --> 25:34.637
that would snap you up
in a second there.

25:34.704 --> 25:36.104
Same goes
for law schools here.

25:36.156 --> 25:38.774
Yeah,
but they're not Harvard,

25:38.825 --> 25:42.628
which means
they're second tier.

25:42.712 --> 25:44.964
You seriously expected me
to drop everything

25:45.048 --> 25:46.215
and move to New York?

25:46.282 --> 25:48.050
Yeah, I did.

25:48.117 --> 25:50.136
Okay, well, I think
that's a little presumptuous.

25:50.220 --> 25:51.137
Me?

25:51.221 --> 25:52.621
What about you?

25:52.672 --> 25:54.507
You're the one who has us
buying a place on Bacon Hill.

25:54.591 --> 25:57.676
Okay, it's "Beacon Hill,"
and I thought you liked it.

25:57.761 --> 26:00.763
To visit.
I mean, not to live.

26:00.814 --> 26:02.431
And what are you talking about,
our law schools are second tier?

26:02.482 --> 26:03.516
Your city is second tier.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.968
Well, maybe my city
is second tier.

26:06.019 --> 26:09.488
But it's also the home of
the woman you supposedly love.

26:09.573 --> 26:12.441
Oh, Sheila,
come on, please.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.160
I mean, everything I have
is in New York.

26:14.244 --> 26:17.746
Everything except me.

26:26.865 --> 26:30.201
It's usually easier
if you look at the screen.

26:30.268 --> 26:32.036
With your eyes.

26:32.103 --> 26:34.488
I'm...I'm sorry.

26:34.573 --> 26:38.542
It's just been
one of those weeks.

26:38.610 --> 26:40.711
You know Louis
is gonna be okay, right?

26:40.779 --> 26:44.548
Yeah, I know
he's going to be okay.

26:44.616 --> 26:47.168
But at the moment,
I hate his guts.

26:55.694 --> 26:58.796
I hear congratulations
are in order.

26:58.847 --> 27:01.399
Jessica.

27:01.466 --> 27:05.603
Another eligible bachelor
bites the dust.

27:05.654 --> 27:08.155
Yeah.
I mean, no, it's--

27:08.240 --> 27:09.407
[chuckles]
It's amazing.

27:09.474 --> 27:10.858
How are you feeling?

27:10.942 --> 27:13.361
Better, thanks.

27:13.445 --> 27:17.815
I wanted to get you
a little welcome-back something.

27:17.866 --> 27:20.368
It's not much.

27:23.372 --> 27:26.207
You know, you gave me
quite a scare this week.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.008
I love it.

27:28.093 --> 27:30.211
The Pearson Hardman retreat
five years ago.

27:30.295 --> 27:33.664
And do you know what I
remember most about that night?

27:33.715 --> 27:36.100
What an amazing dancer
you are.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.468
Five years,
Long Island School of Ballet.

27:37.519 --> 27:40.337
[Laughs] You weren't
dancing ballet that night.

27:40.389 --> 27:43.173
Well, they say ballet is
the foundation for everything.

27:43.225 --> 27:46.727
Well, sir, you have
an amazing foundation.

27:46.812 --> 27:50.114
I just thought you could
add that to your collection.

27:50.181 --> 27:53.951
Somewhere between you and...
Bruno.

27:59.858 --> 28:03.210
It means so much to me
that you...

28:03.295 --> 28:05.996
Louis.

28:06.047 --> 28:08.866
Come on.

28:08.917 --> 28:12.035
After everything
we've been through...

28:12.087 --> 28:15.706
You're family.

28:22.547 --> 28:24.064
- Holy shit.
- I know.

28:24.149 --> 28:26.817
He betrayed me.
Maybe, but, Rachel,

28:26.885 --> 28:29.437
you didn't even give him
a chance to explain himself.

28:29.521 --> 28:31.071
I didn't want to upset him.

28:31.156 --> 28:33.741
Even if he was
bullshitting you back then,

28:33.825 --> 28:36.660
the Louis I know
is a man of his word.

28:36.728 --> 28:38.446
And if you went to him
honestly--

28:38.530 --> 28:40.030
It wouldn't matter.

28:40.081 --> 28:41.231
He would just say
he agreed to it,

28:41.283 --> 28:42.666
and Jessica
would still say no.

28:42.734 --> 28:44.401
He might offer to pay.

28:44.453 --> 28:46.570
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't let him.

28:46.621 --> 28:48.005
And you know what,
that's not the problem.

28:48.072 --> 28:49.290
What is the problem?

28:49.374 --> 28:50.695
The problem is
he made me a chump.

28:50.709 --> 28:52.676
- Rachel--
- Donna, I went in there

28:52.744 --> 28:55.913
as a paralegal trying
to negotiate with Louis Litt,

28:55.964 --> 28:58.933
and I left with the money
to become a lawyer,

28:59.017 --> 29:00.184
and for the first time
in my life,

29:00.251 --> 29:02.436
I felt like
I could actually be one.

29:02.521 --> 29:06.223
And now I realize that...
[Chuckles]

29:06.274 --> 29:07.975
When I left that room,

29:08.059 --> 29:11.278
he was probably laughing about
how he pulled one over on me.

29:11.363 --> 29:12.813
Maybe you're right.

29:12.898 --> 29:15.699
But I'm telling you, the Louis
of today would never do that.

29:15.767 --> 29:18.068
Well, the Rachel of today
certainly wouldn't

29:18.119 --> 29:19.436
let him get away with it.

29:19.488 --> 29:22.456
And the Donna of today
is a genius.

29:22.541 --> 29:24.441
Well, the genius of Donna
is every day.

29:24.493 --> 29:27.378
[Laughs]
What are you saying?

29:27.445 --> 29:29.129
Just because
you can't go after Louis

29:29.214 --> 29:33.968
doesn't mean you can't
still make your case.

29:36.054 --> 29:37.338
What the hell
is wrong with you?

29:37.422 --> 29:38.672
You gave me the map to escape

29:38.757 --> 29:39.924
and told the guards
where I'd be.

29:39.975 --> 29:41.642
- Jonathan--
- Kovacs rescinded his offer.

29:41.726 --> 29:43.460
He said I'm not worth it
without that algorithm.

29:43.512 --> 29:46.063
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

29:46.130 --> 29:48.148
You gave me that advice
in the first place.

29:48.233 --> 29:49.713
Because you threatened
to leave Louis.

29:49.768 --> 29:51.068
Bullshit.

29:51.135 --> 29:52.520
You did it because you knew
what I was up against,

29:52.604 --> 29:53.938
and you were
trying to help me.

29:53.989 --> 29:55.239
Whether that's true or not,

29:55.306 --> 29:56.740
that advice was
off the record,

29:56.808 --> 29:59.860
and it turns out that on the
record it's my job to stop you.

29:59.945 --> 30:01.862
Well, congratulations.

30:01.947 --> 30:04.031
You ripped away
the thing I value the most.

30:04.115 --> 30:06.333
That algorithm--it took me
ten years to develop it.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.035
It's how I look
at valuing companies.

30:08.119 --> 30:09.086
It's how I look at the world.

30:09.153 --> 30:11.872
If I can't take it with me,

30:11.957 --> 30:13.374
even if someone thinks
I'm worth something, I'm not.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.325
- Jonathan--
- Please.

30:15.377 --> 30:17.011
You did your job
on the record.

30:17.095 --> 30:21.015
Now off the record,
what do I do?

30:21.099 --> 30:23.667
It was my job to make sure
there's nothing you could do.

30:23.718 --> 30:27.104
Then check in with me
in ten years.

30:27.171 --> 30:28.689
'Cause I promise you
I'll be at the same desk

30:28.773 --> 30:30.674
punching the same clock.

30:30.725 --> 30:32.443
Can't move up,
can't move out.

30:32.510 --> 30:36.063
It's on you.

30:49.377 --> 30:50.694
You were right.

30:50.745 --> 30:55.416
This isn't about William Beck
or Jonathan Sidwell.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.917
It's about me.

30:57.002 --> 30:58.886
- Mike--
- I want to go legit.

30:58.970 --> 31:00.804
- You can't.
- Harvey, listen--

31:00.872 --> 31:02.339
Do I need to state
the obvious?

31:02.390 --> 31:04.708
I can go to law school now,
all right? Get a real degree.

31:04.759 --> 31:05.976
Even if it didn't matter

31:06.044 --> 31:07.227
that you've already
presented yourself

31:07.312 --> 31:08.512
as having gone to Harvard law,

31:08.563 --> 31:09.880
you'd have to take
the bar again.

31:09.931 --> 31:11.231
Okay, I passed it once,
I'll pass it again.

31:11.316 --> 31:12.483
Not under your own name.

31:12.550 --> 31:13.851
And if you take it now,

31:13.902 --> 31:15.886
you'll draw attention
to yourself in a major way.

31:15.937 --> 31:17.655
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

31:17.722 --> 31:19.773
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

31:19.858 --> 31:20.941
Are you insane?

31:21.026 --> 31:22.693
Hacking into the bar
is twice the crime

31:22.744 --> 31:23.894
you've been committing.

31:23.945 --> 31:24.995
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

31:25.063 --> 31:26.413
you don't move
the goddamn body.

31:26.498 --> 31:27.898
You do if they're
about to find it.

31:27.949 --> 31:29.070
They're not
about to find it.

31:29.117 --> 31:31.118
They're always
about to find it!

31:31.202 --> 31:34.788
Mike, committing another fraud
to cover your fraud

31:34.873 --> 31:36.239
isn't going legit.

31:36.291 --> 31:38.459
It's just covering your ass,
and it doesn't undo

31:38.543 --> 31:40.243
the fact that you've already
committed the crime.

31:40.295 --> 31:43.514
You think I haven't thought
about all of this?

31:45.917 --> 31:48.135
Harvey, I'm stuck.

31:48.219 --> 31:51.689
There's no way up,
there's no way down.

31:51.756 --> 31:54.141
[Chuckles]

31:54.225 --> 31:57.928
I can't live
my whole life like this.

32:04.369 --> 32:06.103
Okay.

32:06.154 --> 32:08.789
You want to be legit,

32:08.873 --> 32:10.290
there's only one way.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.910
You go to a small town
in Iowa

32:12.961 --> 32:15.129
where nobody's ever heard
of Harvey Specter,

32:15.213 --> 32:16.964
Jessica Pearson,
or anybody else,

32:17.048 --> 32:20.584
you go to law school,
hang out your shingle.

32:20.635 --> 32:23.087
Nobody will ever know.

32:23.138 --> 32:25.055
I guarantee you'd be
king of the hill.

32:25.123 --> 32:28.625
But you could never
come back to the mountain.

32:28.677 --> 32:32.262
Not here in New York,
Chicago, or L.A.

32:32.313 --> 32:34.982
Someone'll know someone,

32:35.066 --> 32:38.018
and it'll all be for nothing.

32:38.103 --> 32:41.638
I can't do that,
and you know it.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.323
I do know it.

32:43.408 --> 32:46.694
Mike, you're in
the major leagues,

32:46.778 --> 32:49.479
and you get to go toe-to-toe
with the best there is.

32:49.531 --> 32:53.333
And I can't tell you
if that's enough for a lifetime,

32:53.418 --> 32:56.754
but if you want to stay,
there's nothing more you can do.

32:56.821 --> 33:00.424
My advice is hold on tight
and enjoy the ride.

33:12.054 --> 33:14.105
What are you doing here?

33:14.172 --> 33:15.473
I'm here to help you.

33:15.524 --> 33:17.391
You said there was no way
to stop what you did.

33:17.476 --> 33:20.645
This isn't a legal solution.
It's a business solution.

33:20.696 --> 33:23.531
One where everybody wins.
Everybody wins?

33:23.615 --> 33:24.782
That's what you said
about Beck.

33:24.849 --> 33:26.200
So you want me
to spin off my own company,

33:26.285 --> 33:27.201
I run it, he owns it?

33:27.286 --> 33:29.853
I never said that.

33:29.905 --> 33:31.405
Well, he didn't
go for it with Beck.

33:31.490 --> 33:33.291
Why would he go for it
with me?

33:33.358 --> 33:37.411
Because he doesn't give
a shit about William Beck.

33:37.496 --> 33:40.498
What are you saying?

33:40.549 --> 33:42.383
You develop your algorithm
every day.

33:42.467 --> 33:43.384
Of course.

33:43.468 --> 33:44.535
It's useless if I don't.

33:44.586 --> 33:45.720
Right, but that's not
why you do it.

33:45.804 --> 33:46.804
You do it because you love it.

33:46.871 --> 33:48.389
Well, he can
force me to stay,

33:48.473 --> 33:50.141
but he can't force me
to love it.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.542
And that's exactly
where your leverage is.

33:51.593 --> 33:55.313
If you don't love what you do,
it costs him a fortune.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.264
And he knows it.

33:57.349 --> 33:59.233
This isn't a sure thing.

33:59.318 --> 34:00.318
Which is why
I'm trusting he won't know

34:00.385 --> 34:02.103
it came from me
if it doesn't work.

34:02.187 --> 34:05.439
Why are you doing this?

34:05.524 --> 34:09.860
Let's just say
I love my job...

34:09.911 --> 34:12.896
but I know what it feels like
to be trapped.

34:19.371 --> 34:21.038
Donna said
you wanted to see me

34:21.089 --> 34:23.341
about some more
managerial bullshit.

34:23.408 --> 34:24.742
What?

34:24.793 --> 34:26.627
Don't you think I learned
my lesson with the checks?

34:26.712 --> 34:30.246
- Then why am I here?
- You're here to listen to me.

34:30.297 --> 34:32.850
Do you know
what this is about?

34:32.917 --> 34:35.085
Yes.
And I already told you--

34:35.137 --> 34:37.888
I am not here to ask you
to honor Louis' contract.

34:37.938 --> 34:41.308
I am here to ask you
to make a new one with me.

34:41.393 --> 34:42.525
Our contract with you

34:42.594 --> 34:43.860
is a promise of a job
when you get out,

34:43.928 --> 34:46.063
not paying for you
on your way in.

34:46.114 --> 34:47.947
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

34:48.033 --> 34:51.485
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

34:51.570 --> 34:53.937
Give me an advance on mine.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.956
The last time we negotiated,
you said,

34:56.041 --> 34:58.626
"never sign something without
getting something in return."

34:58.710 --> 35:00.578
What you're getting
in return

35:00.629 --> 35:03.164
is that I keep working here
part-time.

35:03.248 --> 35:06.617
The advance, plus my salary,
will cover my tuition.

35:06.668 --> 35:09.086
Paralegals
don't make that much.

35:09.137 --> 35:10.471
Those numbers don't add up.

35:10.555 --> 35:12.339
I'm not proposing
being a paralegal.

35:12.424 --> 35:14.759
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

35:14.810 --> 35:16.126
and I can do the same.

35:16.178 --> 35:19.129
You came up with that
pretty fast.

35:19.181 --> 35:20.731
It's almost
as if you wanted me

35:20.799 --> 35:22.483
to ask you
what I get in return.

35:22.567 --> 35:25.019
- Do we have a deal?
- One problem.

35:25.103 --> 35:28.105
You already asked me
to break precedent once

35:28.156 --> 35:30.741
when I waived
the Harvard rule.

35:30.809 --> 35:33.143
I'm not breaking it again
to pay for law school.

35:33.195 --> 35:35.663
I'm not asking you
to break anything.

35:35.747 --> 35:40.367
You already established
precedence, with him.

35:40.452 --> 35:43.454
When you paid
for his law school.

35:43.505 --> 35:45.155
That is not
common knowledge.

35:45.207 --> 35:47.675
No, it's not.

35:47.759 --> 35:49.543
That's why
she wanted me here.

35:49.628 --> 35:51.429
I'm exhibit A.

35:51.496 --> 35:52.630
You made an investment
in Harvey,

35:52.681 --> 35:55.182
and I think
that turned out pretty well.

35:55.267 --> 35:57.601
I could argue that point.

35:57.669 --> 36:01.188
No, Rachel's right.
I'm pretty awesome.

36:01.273 --> 36:03.006
I assume you have this
in writing.

36:03.058 --> 36:04.942
I wouldn't be worth it
if I didn't.

36:05.009 --> 36:08.195
Let me guess.
He went for it.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.848
He did.

36:14.619 --> 36:16.654
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

36:16.705 --> 36:19.523
I want you to join
my new corporation.

36:19.574 --> 36:22.710
It's an offer letter.

36:22.794 --> 36:24.161
I don't understand.

36:24.212 --> 36:25.830
You said you know
what it's like to feel trapped.

36:25.881 --> 36:27.498
Thought maybe
you'd like a way out.

36:27.549 --> 36:29.867
- I also said I love what I do.
- Maybe.

36:29.918 --> 36:33.036
But let me tell you
what I once told Louis Litt.

36:33.088 --> 36:36.423
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

36:36.508 --> 36:38.425
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

36:38.510 --> 36:42.263
Wait a second.

36:42.347 --> 36:44.648
You're not asking me to be
your in-house counsel.

36:44.716 --> 36:46.400
You kidding me?

36:46.485 --> 36:48.819
Most people don't even know
what an algorithm is.

36:48.887 --> 36:52.773
You used it to strong-arm me
and Tony Gianopolous.

36:52.858 --> 36:54.608
You have a mind for this.

36:54.693 --> 36:56.360
Jonathan...

36:56.411 --> 36:59.747
You don't have
to answer right now.

36:59.831 --> 37:01.499
Just think about this.

37:01.566 --> 37:05.703
You're in
the minor leagues here.

37:05.754 --> 37:09.924
I'm giving you a chance
to play in the majors.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.312
I'm glad you came.

37:31.396 --> 37:34.431
I hope you don't mind.

37:34.482 --> 37:37.201
I thought you might like it.

37:37.268 --> 37:40.204
[Both chuckle]

37:40.271 --> 37:42.606
- Sheila...
- It's just a gesture.

37:42.657 --> 37:44.608
It's a beautiful gesture.

37:44.659 --> 37:46.877
You're so...

37:46.945 --> 37:49.112

Oh, no,
is this where you tell me

37:51.383 --> 37:55.920
that you're not gonna
move to Boston?

37:55.971 --> 37:58.505
Not everybody sees me
the way you do.

37:58.590 --> 38:02.960
Most people take a very,
very long time to figure me out.

38:03.011 --> 38:06.897
It's taken me years and years
to get the people here to see

38:06.965 --> 38:10.734
past my short temper
and my...

38:10.802 --> 38:12.570
Weird obsessions.

38:12.637 --> 38:14.238
Your love of mudding
is not weird.

38:14.305 --> 38:17.658
Well, you see, I know that.

38:17.742 --> 38:20.694
You know who else knows that?

38:20.779 --> 38:21.812
Donna,

38:21.863 --> 38:25.199
Jessica, Mike, Rachel,
and Harvey.

38:25.283 --> 38:29.152
They appreciate me.

38:29.204 --> 38:30.337
They're my family.

38:30.422 --> 38:32.172
I'm asking you...

38:32.257 --> 38:34.842
Please don't make me
leave my family.

38:37.379 --> 38:40.163
I'll move to New York.

38:43.768 --> 38:46.270
Yeah.

38:46.337 --> 38:49.273
- You won't regret this.
- I know I won't.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.675
I promise I'm gonna
give you the best life.

38:51.726 --> 38:53.644
We're gonna be
a New York power couple.

38:53.695 --> 38:55.178

world, watch out.

38:57.348 --> 39:00.567
Sazs-Litts,
they're gonna be ridiculous.

39:00.652 --> 39:01.869
Wait, what?

39:01.953 --> 39:03.954
I mean, let's face it.
Our kids?

39:04.022 --> 39:06.523
They hit the genetic lottery.

39:06.574 --> 39:08.826
Louis, I don't want kids.

39:08.877 --> 39:10.878
What?

39:10.962 --> 39:12.796
They don't get me.

39:12.864 --> 39:16.033
What? I mean, what--
what are you talking about?

39:16.084 --> 39:17.718
I don't like kids.

39:17.802 --> 39:21.171
I like when they're 22
and going to law school,

39:21.222 --> 39:22.256
but I just...

39:22.340 --> 39:24.341
Those would be adults.

39:24.392 --> 39:27.645
Exactly.

39:27.712 --> 39:30.431
No, no, no.

39:32.067 --> 39:35.486
You may think that now,
but when it actually happens,

39:35.553 --> 39:38.822
when--when they're yours,
it's so--

39:38.890 --> 39:42.392
Louis, I'm never
gonna think that, ever.

39:43.895 --> 39:47.397
- How can you--
- How can I what?

39:47.449 --> 39:49.950
It's who I am.

39:50.035 --> 39:54.755
Sheila,
I'm gonna be a father.

39:54.839 --> 39:56.907
Louis, we're so happy.

39:56.958 --> 39:59.242
We can be happy.

39:59.294 --> 40:01.411
Just us.

40:05.633 --> 40:08.686
I was willing to give up
Harvard for you.

40:11.639 --> 40:14.525
You can't give up
something for me?
