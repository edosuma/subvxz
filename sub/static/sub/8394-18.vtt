WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.065
- OH, HEY, DREW.
YOU LOOKING FOR NATALIE?

00:03.210 --> 00:04.859
SHE'S IN HERE.
- I CAN STAY HERE.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.137
- AND YOU'RE STILL
GONNA GO TO SCHOOL AND STUFF?

00:06.280 --> 00:07.611
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.375
- THE KIDS AT SCHOOL
ARE STARTING TO NOTICE

00:09.520 --> 00:13.149
THAT MAX HAS HIS DIFFERENCES,
AND HE'S ALL ALONE AND HELPLESS.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.622
- I'M THEIR
REAL-ESTATE AGENT, KAREN.

00:14.770 --> 00:16.738
WE ARE GONNA GET YOUR PARENTS'
HOUSE READY TO SELL.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.428
- WE'RE SHU'ITLING
OUR KIDS BACK AND FORTH

00:18.570 --> 00:20.049
WITH THESE LITTLE
ROLLER SUITCASES.

00:20.190 --> 00:23.353
- THE THERAPIST TOLD US
WE HAVE TO SET UP A ROUTINE

00:23.500 --> 00:24.467
AND BE CONSISTENT
WITH THE SCHEDULE.

00:24.610 --> 00:26.498
- I HAVE THIS JOB
FOR SURFSPORT,

00:26.640 --> 00:28.255
AND SO I WONDERED
IF WE COULD DO THE JOB TOGETHER.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.574
- JUST LIKE WE USED TO?
- EXCEPT THAT I'M THE BOSS.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.290
- YEAH.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.614
- ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL SARAH
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER?

00:39.720 --> 00:40.926
- I THINK IT'S GOOD.

00:41.070 --> 00:42.958
- IT IS.
IT'S GOOD.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.657
SEND IT.
- BUT I DON'T KNOW.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.313
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD
OPEN IT UP ONE MORE TIME.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.007
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- JUST LOOK AT IT ONE MORE TIME.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.869
- JUST STOP
SECOND-GUESSING YOURSELF.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.489
IT'S GOOD. SEND IT.
- YEAH, BUT I WANT IT

00:52.630 --> 00:53.767
TO BE PERFECT.
- HIT "SEND." IT'S PERFECT.

00:53.910 --> 00:56.902
- NO, YOU SAID
THAT NOTHING'S EVER PERFECT.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.256
YOU SAID THAT,
AND NOW, OH--

00:58.400 --> 01:00.049
- NOTHING UNTIL NOW.
- NOW YOU'RE SAYING--

01:00.190 --> 01:01.669
- COME ON,
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

01:01.820 --> 01:02.844
WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.
IT'S--IT'S OVER, ALL RIGHT?

01:02.990 --> 01:06.221
THE FAT LADY
IS TAKING A BATH RIGHT NOW.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.598
- HOW ABOUT THIS LETTER?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.615
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE--
OH, OH.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.502
- CONGRATULATIONS.

01:11.650 --> 01:14.619
YOU JUST SENT
YOUR FIRST MAJOR PROJECT.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.309
- ALL RIGHTY.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.906
I GOT THE REST
OF YOUR TOILETRIES, BUDDY.

01:27.050 --> 01:29.109
DON'T FORGET TO BRUSH.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.488
OKAY.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.460
HONEY, WHY ARE
YOU BRINGING YOUR BOOTS?

01:32.600 --> 01:34.079
IT'S GONNA BE, LIKE,
80 IN SACRAMENTO, RIGHT?

01:34.230 --> 01:35.367
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M STILL GONNA NEED THEM

01:35.500 --> 01:36.819
BECAUSE AFI'ER VISITING
SUTI'ER'S MILL,

01:36.950 --> 01:38.508
MY CLASS IS GOING
TO BE PANNING FOR GOLD

01:38.650 --> 01:39.776
ON THE SOUTHERN FORK
OF THE AMERICAN RIVER.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.091
- OH.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.265
- THE RIVER'S BEEN MOSTLY
STRIPPED CLEAN

01:42.410 --> 01:43.479
SINCE THE GOLD RUSH ERA,

01:43.620 --> 01:45.474
SO I DON'T EXPECT
TO FIND ANYTHING,

01:45.620 --> 01:47.508
BUT MANY TOURISTS
STILL ENJOY TRYING.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.379
- ALL RIGHTY.
- [groans]

01:49.520 --> 01:50.828
I'M NOT GONNA ENJOY TRYING
IF MY FEET ARE WET AND COLD,

01:50.970 --> 01:52.688
SO I'M TAKING MY BOOTS.
- I GOT YOU 100%.

01:52.830 --> 01:54.206
WELL, YOU CAN
PUT THEM IN MY BAG.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.510
- NO, I CAN'T
PUT THEM IN YOUR BAG.

01:55.660 --> 01:56.968
- YEAH, YOU CAN.
I HAVE TONS OF ROOM.

01:57.110 --> 01:58.554
- NO, I CAN'T
BECAUSE YOUR BAG ISN'T GOING.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.974
- HONEY, OF COURSE
MY BAG IS GOING.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.246
I'M NOT GONNA
WALK AROUND WITH NO CLOTHES.

02:01.390 --> 02:02.357
- NO, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO CHAPERONE.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.569
AND SO
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

02:03.700 --> 02:05.463
FOR YOUR BAG TO GO
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.353
- WAIT.
WHAT--HONEY, I'M--

02:08.500 --> 02:09.910
- I WISH I WAS
STILL FRIENDS WITH MICAH.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.778
HE GETS TO TAKE AN EXTRA BAG
BECAUSE OF HIS WHEELCHAIR.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.672
- OKAY, CAN YOU STOP
FOR A SECOND?

02:13.820 --> 02:15.128
WHY DON'T
YOU WANT ME TO CHAPERONE?

02:15.270 --> 02:17.158
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.849
I JUST DON'T.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.160
OKAY.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.541
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO WEAR THESE ON THE BUS.

02:25.690 --> 02:28.557
[mellow acoustic guitar music]
- [singing indistinctly]

02:45.400 --> 02:46.947
- THANK YOU, BERKELEY.
- SO SWEET.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.819
- OH, MAN, THAT WAS...

02:48.960 --> 02:49.813
- WHAT IS THAT?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.404
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:51.550 --> 02:54.439
- DREW, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.468
I'LL BE SURE
TO TELL THE NEIGHBOR

02:56.620 --> 02:59.202
WHO WAS SINGING THAT
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

02:59.350 --> 03:00.999
- HOW YOU DOING?
- FINE.

03:01.140 --> 03:04.246
GOOD.

03:04.390 --> 03:05.698
- NO, I'M--
- ARE YOU STONED?

03:05.840 --> 03:07.796
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YOU'RE NOT?

03:07.940 --> 03:09.862
YOU'RE NOT STONED?
THIS WAS JUST HANGING OUT HERE?

03:10.010 --> 03:12.831
- HEY--YOU SAID
THAT IT WAS IN THE FREEZER.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.140
- UNBELIEVABLE.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.326
YES, I KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

03:16.470 --> 03:18.631
DREW, I DON'T CARE,
BUT I MEAN, IT'S--

03:18.780 --> 03:20.054
IT'S, LIKE, 11:30
IN THE MORNING.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.054
- YEAH, IT'S--
I'M DEFINITELY FEELING TIRED.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.883
- IT'S, LIKE, REALLY THAT BAD?

03:24.030 --> 03:26.476
WE'RE AT, LIKE,
DEFCON WAKE-AND-BAKE?

03:26.620 --> 03:27.439
- WHAT?
- THIS DRAMATIC SITUATION?

03:27.580 --> 03:29.377
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

03:29.510 --> 03:32.138
- I'M FINE.
I'M FI--I'M DOING GOOD.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.133
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
BY THE WAY?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.555
- WHY AM I HERE?
I LIVE HERE.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.419
- YOU USED
TO WORK RIGHT NOW.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.039
- YOU USED TO GO
TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.249
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.618
- HA HA.
- GOT YOU.

03:41.770 --> 03:43.101
- I'VE BEEN NOT GOING
TO SOME OF THE CLASSES

03:43.250 --> 03:45.354
THAT I HAVE WITH NATALIE.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.762
- YEAH, I AM AWARE,

03:46.910 --> 03:48.389
WHICH IS--
MUST BE, LIKE, EVERY CLASS

03:48.530 --> 03:49.872
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU LEAVE THE APARTMENT.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.739
- THERE IS A CLASS THAT I TAKE
THAT SHE'S NOT IN.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.438
- ONE CLASS?
- YES, ONE CLASS.

03:54.570 --> 03:55.810
- AREN'T YOU WORRIED
THEY'RE GONNA KICK YOU OUT?

03:55.950 --> 03:57.747
- NO, THEY'LL--IT'S FINE.
I'M GONNA GO TO THE CLASS.

03:57.890 --> 03:59.096
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU,
LIKE, THROW AWAY YOUR ENTIRE--

03:59.230 --> 04:00.959
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL GO TO THE CLASS RIGHT NOW.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.239
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, TALK TO ME ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.474
YOU'RE BUMMED ABOUT THIS GIRL?
- YES. I'M UPS--YEAH, BUT--

04:06.620 --> 04:08.030
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
- IT'S FINE.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.341
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M ACTING DUMB.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.309
- YOU'RE NOT.
- I GOT TO GO TO CLASS.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.963
- DREW.
- I NEED TO BE AT CLASS.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.589
I'M GONNA BE LATE.
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CLASS.

04:13.730 --> 04:15.004
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO AVOID ME.
- I'M GONNA EAT.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.074
I MEAN, I'M GONNA GO
TO CLASS AFTER I EAT, THOUGH.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.529
- YEAH, OKAY.
SEE YOU LATER.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.876
[scoffs]

04:22.020 --> 04:22.907
USELESS.
- BLUE 68!

04:23.050 --> 04:25.018
TICKLE PARTY!
HUT, HUT, HIKE!

04:25.160 --> 04:26.775
HOO.
OOH!

04:26.920 --> 04:28.364
DIVING CATCH! T.D.!
- TOUCHDOWN.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.819
- HELLO.
- OH, YEAH,

04:29.950 --> 04:31.087
JUST LET YOURSELF IN.
- I DID KNOCK.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.505
- OH, I--
- HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:33.650 --> 04:34.958
- MOM, DAD!
- WHO ARE YOU?

04:35.100 --> 04:38.092
- I'M THE WOMAN WHO'S GONNA MAKE
YOUR GRANDPARENTS' DAY.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.447
- JEEZ, WHAT'S ALL THE YELLING
ABOUT DOWN THERE?

04:40.590 --> 04:42.273
- AY, Y1, Y1, DAD, YOU GOT
TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE ON.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.853
YOU'RE GONNA SCARE THE BABY.
- WELL, WHAT THE HELL

04:44.000 --> 04:45.479
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
I COULDN'T FIND MY PANTS.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.938
THEY WEREN'T IN THE DRAWER.

04:47.070 --> 04:47.968
HEY, CAMILLE.
WHERE THE HELL ARE MY PANTS?

04:48.110 --> 04:49.418
- THEY'RE IN THE DRYER.
I TOLD YOU.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.481
- THEY'RE IN THE DRYER.
- OH, HELLO.

04:50.630 --> 04:53.383
- HELLO, HI.
HOPEFULLY THIS ISN'T A BAD TIME?

04:53.530 --> 04:55.043
- NO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.

04:55.190 --> 04:57.420
WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.
- ZEEK, PUT ON SOME PANTS.

04:57.570 --> 04:58.776
- SHE DOESN'T CARE
IF I'M NOT IN PANTS.

04:58.910 --> 05:00.116
DO YOU?
- I DON'T CARE.

05:00.260 --> 05:01.568
- IF GRANDPA
DOESN'T HAVE TO WEAR PANTS,

05:01.710 --> 05:02.745
I DON'T WANT
TO WEAR PANTS EITHER.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.359
- OH, BOY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:04.510 --> 05:05.260
NO ONE NEEDS PANTS--
IT'S FINE--

05:05.400 --> 05:07.846
NOT FOR THIS AMAZING NEWS.

05:07.990 --> 05:10.129
I FOUND THE PERFECT BUYER
FOR THIS PLACE.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.090
- OH.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.855
- WE'RE NOT EVEN ON THE MARKET.
- I KNOW.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.581
BUT ANOTHER
REAL-ESTATE AGENT CALLED

05:15.720 --> 05:16.891
WITH A HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUYER,

05:17.040 --> 05:18.348
AND APPARENTLY
THIS PLACE IS EXACTLY

05:18.490 --> 05:19.718
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

05:19.870 --> 05:22.725
- BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET, OBVIOUSLY.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.451
- DON'T YOU WANT
MORE THAN ONE BUYER

05:24.600 --> 05:26.283
TO LOOK AT IT SO YOU CAN
GET IN A BIDDING WAR?

05:26.420 --> 05:28.900
- SOMETIMES, BUT IN THIS CASE,
THIS GUY IS SERIOUS,

05:29.050 --> 05:30.665
AND I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

05:30.810 --> 05:33.631
THIS COULD BE HUGE.
- WELL, WE HAVEN'T PAINTED.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.702
WE DIDN'T FIX THE WINDOWS.
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

05:35.850 --> 05:36.805
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:36.950 --> 05:38.224
WHY DON'T
I BRING HIM OVER HERE?

05:38.370 --> 05:42.579
IF HE LIKES IT, GREAT.
IF NOT, NO HARM, NO FOUL.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.780
- YOU GUYS ARE
REALLY GONNA SELL THE HOUSE?

05:45.930 --> 05:48.023
- [sighs]

05:48.170 --> 05:50.889
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:51.040 --> 05:53.508
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:53.660 --> 05:55.867
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:56.010 --> 05:58.069
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:58.210 --> 06:00.906
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:01.050 --> 06:03.109
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:03.250 --> 06:05.389
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:05.530 --> 06:06.974
FOREVER YOUNG

06:07.120 --> 06:10.635
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:10.780 --> 06:12.919
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:13.060 --> 06:15.437
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:15.580 --> 06:17.639
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:17.790 --> 06:20.406
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:20.550 --> 06:22.541
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:22.690 --> 06:24.476
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:24.620 --> 06:27.168
FOREVER YOUNG

06:27.310 --> 06:29.449
MAY YOU STAY

06:29.590 --> 06:32.935
FOREVER YOUNG

06:41.190 --> 06:43.465
- MAYBE I SHOULD
GIVE THEM A CALL?

06:43.610 --> 06:45.180
- WELL, WHAT IF THEY DON'T?
- WHO'S PICKING YOU UP TODAY,

06:45.330 --> 06:47.639
YOUR MOM OR YOUR DAD?
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MY DAD.

06:47.780 --> 06:49.577
- I'M SURE
HE'S JUST RUNNING LATE.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.223
- I DON'T THINK HE'S COMING.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.439
- DON'T WORRY.
HE'LL BE HERE.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.330
WANT TO THROW SOME BALLS
WHILE WE WAIT?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.789
- NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.136
W-WHAT IF HE DOESN'T COME?

06:57.270 --> 06:58.851
- HEY.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.228
BUDDY, IT'S OKAY.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.519
SOMEONE IS COMING.
- BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

07:02.660 --> 07:03.684
THEN WHAT DO I DO?

07:03.830 --> 07:06.890
[cell phone ringing]

07:07.040 --> 07:08.211
- THIS IS JOEL.

07:08.350 --> 07:10.830
YEAH, HEY, COACH.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.186
YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S MY DAY TO PICK HIM UP.

07:12.320 --> 07:17.257
I'M--I'M ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE.
YOU SEE ME?

07:20.950 --> 07:23.259
OH, CRAP.
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.049
YEP.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.123
HEY.

07:29.270 --> 07:30.407

07:30.550 --> 07:31.642
- SEE? THERE HE IS.
- HEY, SORRY.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.758
SORRY, I WENT
TO THE WRONG FIELD.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.164
I JUST MISREAD THE SCHEDULE.

07:36.310 --> 07:38.039
YOU READY, BUDDY?

07:38.180 --> 07:39.272
- LET'S GO.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.069
- OKAY.
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.529
- YEP.
- COME ON.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.218
- THANKS FOR STAYING
LATE, COACH.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.452
- YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.015
- ALL HE SAID WAS,
"I DON'T KNOW."

07:50.150 --> 07:51.321
THAT'S ALL I COULD GET OUT
OF HIM, WAS, "I DON'T KNOW."

07:51.470 --> 07:53.779
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE JUST DOESN'T WANT HIS MOM

07:53.920 --> 07:55.148
TO GO WITH HIM
ON THE FIELD TRIP.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.052
- WELL, HONEY, I DON'T CARE.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.428
- IT IS A BIG DEAL, OKAY?
IT'S A LONG BUS RIDE.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.502
HE'S GONNA SPEND
THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL.

08:00.650 --> 08:01.719
HE'S GONNA BE AROUND KIDS

08:01.860 --> 08:02.884
HE'S NOT NORMALLY AROUND,
YOU KNOW?

08:03.030 --> 08:04.782
I JUST WANT
TO BE THERE TO HELP.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.238
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST--
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S A BIG DEAL.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.336
THERE'S GONNA BE
SO MANY THINGS ON THIS TRIP

08:08.480 --> 08:09.469
THAT ARE GONNA
BE HARD FOR HIM.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.848
HE JUST
DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.729
- I THINK THAT THOSE THINGS
ARE GONNA BE HARD FOR HIM

08:12.870 --> 08:13.757
WHETHER OR NOT YOU GO.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.629
- BUT IF I GO--
IF I GO,

08:15.770 --> 08:16.998
I CAN, YOU KNOW--
- WHAT, FIX THINGS?

08:17.150 --> 08:19.038
- I CAN HELP.
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.523
I SAID JUST MAYBE
NAVIGATE THINGS--

08:21.670 --> 08:23.456
- MAYBE THIS'LL BE GOOD FOR HIM
TO TRY AND FIX SOME THINGS

08:23.600 --> 08:24.589
SO HE FEELS
LIKE HE CAN DO IT.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.082
- SCREW IT. I'M GOING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:26.220 --> 08:27.255
HE'S A KID.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.469
HE DOESN'T GET IT.

08:28.610 --> 08:29.872
- HE'S NOT A KID ANYMORE,
KRISTINA.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.191
HE'S A TEENAGER.
- HE IS A KID.

08:31.330 --> 08:32.809
- [sighs]

08:32.960 --> 08:34.268
- I THINK HE JUST WANTS
SOME MORE INDEPENDENCE.

08:34.410 --> 08:35.672
WE GAVE HIM THAT RADIUS
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

08:35.820 --> 08:36.923
WHICH, FOR THE MOST PART,
WORKED OUT REALLY WELL.

08:37.060 --> 08:38.709
I THINK HE JUST
WANTS A LITTLE MORE.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.339
I SAY
WE GIVE IT TO HIM.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.608
- I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.864
HE'S STILL
A BABY TO ME, YOU KNOW?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.719
- LOOK, HE WANTS
TO GO ON HIS OWN...

08:48.870 --> 08:50.553
RIGHT?
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.144
HE'S GROWING UP.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.315
I SAY WE SUPPORT HIM,
DON'T STAND IN HIS WAY.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.258
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

08:57.390 --> 09:00.769
- OH, MY GOD, THEY'VE BEEN
UP THERE A LONG TIME.

09:00.910 --> 09:03.049
- LET'S JUST HOPE
THEY DON'T OPEN THE HALL CLOSET.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.636
IT'S WHERE I SHOVED
ALL THE BABY STUFF.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.577
- WELL, SHE SAID
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.917
- YEAH, BUT A HOUSE LOOKS
BIGGER WHEN IT'S NOT CLUTTERED.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.881
- OH, JEEZ.
THE HOUSE IS THE SIZE IT IS.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.850
WE'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THAT.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.821
- HE SEEMED REALLY NEGATIVE
ABOUT THE FRONT YARD, DIDN'T HE?

09:17.970 --> 09:19.346
- WELL, HE CALLED
MY BARN A "SHED,"

09:19.480 --> 09:20.924
SAID HE DIDN'T
LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKED.

09:21.070 --> 09:24.244
I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY HE LOOKS.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.698
- WHY DON'T
I MAKE US SOME TEA?

09:25.840 --> 09:28.308
- OH, IN OUR MASSIVELY
OUTDATED KITCHEN?

09:28.460 --> 09:32.942
- WELL, IT'S NOT VERY MODERN.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.490
- HONEY, IT'S PERFECT
THE WAY IT IS.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.677
I MEAN, HE TOLD HIS REAL-ESTATE
AGENT HE WANTS TO GUT IT.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.539
I MEAN, I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE
OF THIS.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.602
- WHEN IT'S NOT OURS ANYMORE.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.024
- [clears throat]

09:43.160 --> 09:44.149
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TYPE OF WOOD THIS IS?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.471
- YEAH, I CAN TELL YOU.
THAT'S OAK.

09:45.610 --> 09:48.784
I PUT THAT IN MYSELF
AFTER ONE OF MY SONS BROKE IT

09:48.930 --> 09:50.329
WHEN HE SLID DOWN
THE BANNISTER.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.347
THAT BABY SURVIVED
30 YEARS OF KIDS AND GRANDKIDS.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.960
THAT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.897
YOU GOT KIDS, MISTER...
- SPENCER.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.246
TWO.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.551
- WELL, I THINK
WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.804
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.009
- OKAY, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO DO ANOTHER WALK-THROUGH,

10:06.150 --> 10:07.970
MAYBE CHECK THE PLACE OUT
A LITTLE BIT,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.519
HAPPY TO LET YOU GO
THROUGH IT BY YOURSELVES.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.251
- NO, THANK YOU.
WE'RE GOOD.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.506
- OKAY, WELL, I'LL JUST--
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.390
- ANY THOUGHTS THERE, SPENCE?

10:15.540 --> 10:18.509
- THANK YOU, SIR.

10:18.650 --> 10:19.742
[door closes]

10:19.890 --> 10:21.471
- WHEW.
MAN.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.679
"WHAT KIND OF WOOD IS THIS?
WHAT KIND OF WOOD IS THIS?"

10:23.830 --> 10:25.161
- OKAY, WE GOT TWO LUNCHES.

10:25.310 --> 10:28.689
WE GOT TWO BACKPACKS
AND ONE CLASSROOM SALAMANDER.

10:28.830 --> 10:29.990
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.619
- WHO'S PICKING ME UP
FROM SCHOOL TODAY?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.625
- IT'S WEDNESDAY, SO YOUR MOM'S
GONNA BE PICKING YOU UP.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.032
- WHAT TIME
IS SHE PICKING ME UP?

10:35.180 --> 10:36.488
- WHEN SCHOOL'S OVER.
DUH.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.519
- SYD. YOU AND YOUR SISTER
CAN WAIT BY THE WALL.

10:39.670 --> 10:40.807
- NOT ME, I'M GOING OVER

10:40.950 --> 10:42.599
TO CARLY AND CASSIE'S
AFTER SCHOOL.

10:42.740 --> 10:43.775
- DOES YOUR MOM KNOW?
- UH-HUH.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.537
I TOLD HER NOT TO PICK ME UP.
- OKAY.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.740
- YEAH, BUT THEN SHE'LL THINK
THAT I DON'T NEED A RIDE HOME.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.677
- BUDDY, SHE--SHE KNOWS.
SHE KNOWS.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.674
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU DON'T TALK TO HER.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.981
- WE TALK.
COME ON.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.189
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'LL--I'LL CALL HER RIGHT NOW.

10:56.340 --> 10:57.432
HOLD ON. I'LL CALL HER RIGHT
NOW,

10:57.580 --> 10:58.820
AND YOU CAN
HEAR IT FROM HER.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.962
- WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.204
- HEY, JULIA.

11:04.350 --> 11:05.578
I'M JUST OUTSIDE
THE SCHOOL WITH THE--THE KIDS,

11:05.730 --> 11:07.823
AND WE JUST
WANT TO CONFIRM

11:07.970 --> 11:10.382
THAT YOU'LL BE
HERE AFTERWARDS, OKAY?

11:10.530 --> 11:12.669
CALL ME BACK.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.528
- LET'S GO.
- OKAY, WE GOOD?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.149
- I DON'T KNOW.
- GOD, VICTOR.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.520
WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A BABY?
- SYD, NONE OF THAT.

11:18.670 --> 11:19.773
GET OUT OF HERE.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.420
LOVE YOU.
- MWAH. BYE.

11:20.570 --> 11:23.289
- BYE.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.577
BUDDY...

11:24.710 --> 11:27.679
SHE'LL BE HERE, OKAY?

11:31.270 --> 11:33.158
- YEAH.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.764
- ALL RIGHT. YEAH.
USED THE BATHROOM?

11:44.910 --> 11:46.138
- YEAH.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.075
- I THINK
THERE'S A BATHROOM ON THE BUS

11:47.220 --> 11:48.244
IF YOU NEED TO GO.
- YOU'VE ASKED ME

11:48.390 --> 11:49.311
ALL OF THIS
FIVE TIMES ALREADY.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.631
- I KNOW.
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

11:50.770 --> 11:51.668
SO WHO YOU SITTING
WITH ON THE BUS?

11:51.810 --> 11:52.970
- I DON'T KNOW.
- DON'T KNOW.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.394
- I DON'T WANT YOU TWO
TO WALK ME ON THERE.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.222
- WELL, MAX, HEY, UH...
- CAN I HAVE A HUG?

11:55.360 --> 11:58.227
WE LOVE YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:58.370 --> 12:00.088
- HI, BUD.

12:00.230 --> 12:03.097
- HIGH FIVES ALL AROUND

12:03.230 --> 12:05.858
EVERYTHING'S GOING DOWN

12:06.000 --> 12:07.718
EVERYTHING'S GOING

12:07.860 --> 12:10.966
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T STOP IT

12:11.100 --> 12:14.035
[children chattering
indistinctly]

12:14.180 --> 12:15.863
- [inhales deeply]

12:16.010 --> 12:17.204
[sighs]

12:17.350 --> 12:19.830
- JULIA.
HI.

12:19.980 --> 12:21.106
- LIZZIE.
- DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

12:21.250 --> 12:24.003
- I'M NOT SURE THAT I DO.
- I'M SORRY?

12:24.150 --> 12:26.209
- MY MARRIAGE
IS MY BUSINESS, OKAY?

12:26.360 --> 12:28.976
I'M SORRY IF THAT'S RUDE
OR BLUNT OR SOMETHING,

12:29.120 --> 12:30.087
BUT THE GOSSIP
HAS GOT TO STOP.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.538
I'M SICK
AND I'M TIRED OF IT.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.772
I'M SERIOUS.
- OF COURSE.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.026
NO, I RESPECT YOUR, UH...
[stammering]

12:36.160 --> 12:37.741
ACTUALLY, IT'S
ABOUT THE CELL PHONE.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.300
- WHAT?
- IT'S JUST I KNOW

12:39.440 --> 12:42.682
THAT WE DON'T HAVE
AN OFFICIAL RULE OR ANYTHING,

12:42.830 --> 12:45.037
BUT UNOFFICIALLY, I THOUGHT
WE'D ALL AGREED TO WAIT

12:45.170 --> 12:46.410
UNTIL THE SIXTH GRADE
TO GET THEM FOR OUR KIDS.

12:46.550 --> 12:47.721
- OKAY.

12:47.870 --> 12:48.939
- IT'S NOT
MY BUSINESS, OF COURSE,

12:49.070 --> 12:50.583
BUT NOW
THAT VICTOR HAS ONE--

12:50.730 --> 12:52.140
- VICTOR DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.554
- BASICALLY EVERY KID
IN THE CLASS WANTS ONE.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.453
- OKAY, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.931
- MOM!

12:58.080 --> 13:00.799
LOOK AT THE NEW PHONE
DAD GOT ME!

13:00.950 --> 13:02.394
LOOK, IT'S BLUE!
[chuckles]

13:02.540 --> 13:04.496
LOOK!

13:10.920 --> 13:12.888
- HEY.
- HEY?

13:13.030 --> 13:15.089
[bell tolling]
WHAT, THAT'S ALL I GET?

13:15.240 --> 13:18.403
NO LOVE FOR
A SUCCESSFUL STALKING MISSION?

13:18.550 --> 13:21.860
- YEAH, YOU FOUND THE ONE CLASS
WE DON'T HAVE TOGETHER.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.206
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
- DREW, COME ON.

13:23.350 --> 13:26.729
I'M HERE AT 8:00 AM.
FOR PEACE TALKS.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.280
8:00 A.M.--SERIOUSLY,
WHO TAKES AN 8:00 A.M. CLASS?

13:28.420 --> 13:31.594
IT'S ABSURD.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.049
BUT I'M HERE
AT OH-DARK-THIRTY

13:34.190 --> 13:36.329
'CAUSE I MISS YOU.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.495
WHAT, SERIOUSLY?
A SHRUG?

13:40.640 --> 13:41.607
THAT'S ALL
I'M GONNA GET FROM YOU?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.889
- YES, I'M PISSED AT YOU.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.884
- YOU'RE PISSED AT ME.
OKAY, HEY.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.361
HURT, I GET.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.091
HURT, I CAN--
I CAN LIVE WITH,

13:49.240 --> 13:51.060
BUT YOU DON'T GET
TO BE PISSED AT ME FOR THIS.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.098
- THAT YOU SLEPT
WITH MY FRIEND?

13:52.240 --> 13:53.332
- YOUR FRIEND?
- YEAH.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.163
- SERIOUSLY, YOU BARELY
TOLERATE BERTO.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.754
HE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.
- YOU SLEPT WITH BERTO.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.242
THAT'S WORSE.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.655
- OKAY, WAIT.
LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.074
MY BIG CRIME IS THAT

14:02.220 --> 14:04.142
WHILE WE WERE
VERY CLEARLY NOT TOGETHER,

14:04.290 --> 14:05.518
I SLEPT WITH SOMEBODY

14:05.670 --> 14:07.592
THAT YOU JUST ACCIDENTALLY
HAPPENED TO LIVE WITH?

14:07.740 --> 14:09.947
- IT'S SO DIFFERENT.
YOU SLEPT WITH BERTO.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.318
- REALLY MATURE, DREW.

14:11.470 --> 14:13.392
COME ON,
AT LEAST OWN UP TO IT.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.668
AMY CAME TO TOWN,
AND YOU DROPPED EVERYTHING.

14:16.820 --> 14:19.197
YOU DROPPED SCHOOL.
YOU DROPPED YOUR FRIENDS.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.979
YOU SURE AS HELL DROPPED ME.

14:26.620 --> 14:29.088
OKAY, GOOD TALK.
I'M GLAD WE SORTED ALL THAT OUT.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.652
AND AGAIN, SO SORRY
I SLEPT WITH SOMEBODY

14:31.800 --> 14:33.939
THAT YOU KIND OF, SORT OF KNEW!
MY BAD!

14:38.420 --> 14:40.627
- ANYTHING?
- NO, NOTHING.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.249
NOTHING SINCE THE LAST
THREE TIMES YOU CALLED.

14:42.390 --> 14:43.493
YOU GOT TO--
STOP CALLING, ALL RIGHT?

14:43.640 --> 14:44.493
I'M HANGING UP.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.699
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.114
H-H-HOW DO I DEAL WITH
THE WAITING AND THE NOT KNOWING?

14:49.260 --> 14:52.013
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.388
I GOT TO GO.
- WHAT DOES--WHAT DOES--

14:53.540 --> 14:54.814
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU THINK--

14:54.960 --> 14:56.097
YOU THINK "HEW HATE IT?

14:56.240 --> 14:57.400
I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA KEEP CALLING ME

14:57.550 --> 14:58.027
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM THEM,
WHICH COULD BE DAYS.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.923
- DAYS?

15:01.070 --> 15:02.469
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.474
- YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.
REALLY, YOU'RE RIDICULOUS NOW.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.508
- I'M NOT RIDICULOUS.
I WAS SITTING IN MY APARTMENT.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.548
I WAS DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY,
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME HERE.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.008
YAY.
HERE I AM.

15:10.150 --> 15:11.594
- WELL, I CAN'T--
YOU KNOW, I'M DOING STUFF.

15:11.730 --> 15:13.288
I CAN'T ENTERTAIN YOU
OR ANYTHING.

15:13.420 --> 15:14.899
- WHO'S ASKING
TO BE ENTERTAINED?

15:15.050 --> 15:15.937
I'M NOT ASKING
TO BE ENTERTAINED.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.149
I'M HERE TO ENTERTAIN YOU.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.497
I'M GONNA SING.
I'M GONNA DANCE.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.153
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
WITH THESE FLOWERS.

15:21.290 --> 15:22.530
- TORTURE ME
IS WHAT YOU'RE HERE TO DO.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.057
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TOUCH THE FLOWERS, THOUGH.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.428
- JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:26.580 --> 15:27.365
I GOT GELS.
I CAN'T FIND THE GELS.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.478
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WORKED HERE,

15:29.610 --> 15:31.817
WHEN I PAID YOU
TO--TO--TO DO ALL THIS?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.166
YEAH, FIND THOSE GELS.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.026
I CAN'T FIND 'EM
SINCE YOU STOPPED WORKING.

15:34.170 --> 15:35.478
- FINE.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.611
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR RESPONSE
IS GONNA BE, THOUGH?

15:37.760 --> 15:38.829
- JUST DON'T RAMBLE,

15:38.970 --> 15:42.656
'CAUSE IF YOU RAMBLE,
I'M GONNA PUNCH A BIRD.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.030
- I'M NOT GONNA RAMBLE, OKAY?

15:45.180 --> 15:48.217
I'M JUST HERE
TO HELP YOU AND...

15:48.360 --> 15:51.739
YOU KNOW, I DO WONDER
WHY THEY HAVEN'T CALLED.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.836
WOULDN'T YOU JUST
CALL TO SAY,

15:53.980 --> 15:55.561
"OH, WE GOT THE--

15:55.710 --> 15:57.359
YOU KNOW, WE GOT THE EMAIL,
AND IT'S LOOKING GOOD"?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.706
OR, YOU KNOW,
"OH, WE NEED

15:58.850 --> 16:00.397
A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT,"

16:00.540 --> 16:02.269
OR, LIKE, "HEY, WE'RE HAVING
A MEETING ON TUESDAY,

16:05.200 --> 16:07.054
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE--THE SILENCE.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.644
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.269
[cell phone clicking]

16:10.410 --> 16:12.685
OKAY, I'LL TEXT YOU "GOOD NIGHT"
LATER OR SOMETHING.

16:12.830 --> 16:13.751
- OKAY, SWEETIE.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.106
WOULD YOU--WOULD YOU--HEY.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.865
TELL YOUR DAD
TO COME OUT HERE, OKAY?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.272
- OKAY, SURE.

16:18.420 --> 16:19.273
DAD, MOM'S AT THE DOOR.
- HEY, BUDDY.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.308
OH.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.974
COOL.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.348
- HI.
- HEY.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.013
THE PHONE.
- THE PHONE.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.253
- YES.
- SO...

16:28.400 --> 16:29.799
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

16:29.950 --> 16:31.292
- I KNOW.
- JOEL.

16:31.430 --> 16:34.012
- HE WAS FREAKING OUT YESTERDAY,
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.741
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I WENT TO GO PICK HIM UP,

16:35.890 --> 16:37.334
AND I GOT THE BASEBALL
SCHEDULE MIXED UP,

16:37.470 --> 16:39.472
SO I WENT
TO THE WRONG FIELD.

16:39.610 --> 16:40.747
- SO YOU SHOW UP
AT THE CAFETERIA

16:40.890 --> 16:42.881
WITH A SHINY, NEW PHONE
AT LUNCHTIME

16:43.030 --> 16:44.338
JUST TO MAKE UP
FOR THAT MISTAKE?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.208
- [sighs] IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
IT'S NOT A BRIBE.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.205
LISTEN TO ME.

16:47.350 --> 16:48.487
HE WAS WORRIED
THAT YOU WEREN'T

16:48.620 --> 16:49.928
GONNA PICK HIM UP
THAT AFTERNOON,

16:50.070 --> 16:51.344
AND SO I TRIED
TO REASSURE HIM.

16:51.490 --> 16:52.798
SO I CALLED YOU...
- RIGHT.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.339
- AND YOU DIDN'T--
- I CALLED YOU BACK.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.479
- TEXTED ME BACK
AN HOUR LATER,

16:55.630 --> 16:56.938
AND BY THEN,
HE WAS A TOTAL MESS.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.184
- YOU COULDN'T WAIT AN HOUR
TO MAKE THIS DECISION?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.355
- I KNOW.
YES, I'M SORRY.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.425
- JOEL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- [sighs]

17:04.570 --> 17:05.946
- JOEL...
- HE FEELS LIKE

17:06.090 --> 17:09.014
WE'RE GONNA LET HIM SLIP
THROUGH THE CRACKS, YOU KNOW?

17:09.160 --> 17:10.320
AND H CAN'T BLAME HIM,

17:10.470 --> 17:11.641
WITH THE WAY
WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.054
- LIKE YOU BUYING A PHONE

17:13.200 --> 17:16.124
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME
ABOUT IT FIRST?

17:16.270 --> 17:17.612
YEAH, RIGHT.
OKAY, GOOD.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.204
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE
WITH THAT PART.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.682
- YOU SHOULD
HAVE JUST SEEN HIM, JULIA.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.377
HE'S MELTING DOWN
IN FRONT OF ME,

17:22.520 --> 17:25.489
AND I FEEL LIKE
ALL THESE ABANDONMENT ISSUES--

17:25.630 --> 17:28.554
THEY'RE COMING BACK UP.
- BECAUSE YOU MOVED OUT.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.074
- HE'S GOT--

17:32.220 --> 17:33.426
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE REAL REASON.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.209
- HE'S GOT YOUR NUMBER,
MY NUMBER,

17:35.360 --> 17:36.759
AND YOUR PARENTS' NUMBER
IN THE PHONE.

17:36.910 --> 17:38.491
THAT'S ALL HE'S ALLOWED
TO COMMUNICATE WITH.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.494
- OKAY, HE WAS TEXTING WITH THE
BASEBALL TEAM ON THE WAY HOME.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.050
- OKAY, WELL,
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.010
I'LL TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT.
- YOU TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.127
YOU'RE DOING
THE PARENTING RIGHT NOW.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.407
- [sighs]
I'M SO TIRED OF FIGHTING.

17:46.540 --> 17:47.746
- I DON'T--
- CAN WE JUST STOP?

17:47.890 --> 17:49.744
- YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO FIGHT
FOR ANYTHING.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.994
- I THINK HE CAN HEAR US.
- OKAY, FINE.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.279
THAT'S REAL CONVENIENT.

17:54.410 --> 17:55.684
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, SWEETIE.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.445
YOU JUST GIVE ME A CALL
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

17:57.590 --> 17:58.443
- JULIA...

18:10.910 --> 18:11.945
- [sighs]

18:12.090 --> 18:15.116
[glasses clinking]

18:17.750 --> 18:19.194
[clears throat]

18:19.330 --> 18:22.094
[feigning coughing]

18:22.230 --> 18:23.572
- AMBER.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.711
- IT'S TIME
TO GET UP, MAN.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.067
- WHY DO I NEED TO GET UP?
- BECAUSE THIS CLASS--

18:28.210 --> 18:29.302
IT'S YOUR ONE
NATALIE-FREE CLASS TODAY.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.303
- OH, MY GOSH.
- GET UP.

18:30.450 --> 18:31.656
- I'M NOT
GOING TO MY CLASS.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.131
- YOU HAVE TO GO
TO YOUR CLASS, DREW.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.724
- IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE.
I ALREADY MISSED IT.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.417
- DREW, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
YOU HAVE TO GO.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.767
LOOK, I HAVEN'T BEEN MAKING YOU
DO ANYTHING, OKAY?

18:38.910 --> 18:41.458
SO THE ONE THING YOU HAVE
TO DO IS GO TO YOUR ONE CLASS.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.352
I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU GO TO YOUR ONE CLASS--

18:43.500 --> 18:45.764
- YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO
TO MY CLASS.

18:45.910 --> 18:47.218
- I CAN MAKE YOU.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.225
IT'S MY APARTMENT,
AND YOU HAVE TO GO, OKAY?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.941
- THANK YOU.
IT'S VERY BRIGHT.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.398
JEEZ.
- DREW...

18:52.540 --> 18:53.268
STOP BEING SUCH A BABY
AND GO TO YOUR CLASS.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.640
- OH, MY GOD.

18:54.780 --> 18:57.123
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO CLASS, OKAY?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.431
I DON'T WANT TO SEE BERTO
AND NATALIE.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.501
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT. PLEASE.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.299
SHE'S ALWAYS ASKING ME
IF I'M OKAY.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.441
IT'S INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.

19:04.590 --> 19:06.160
ALL RIGHT, I'M SAD.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.584
I'M SAD ABOUT AMY,

19:07.730 --> 19:11.769
AND I WANT TO SMOKE WEED
AND WRITE BAD SONGS.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.663
- DREW, OF COURSE.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.803
I'M SORRY.
I-I UNDERSTAND.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.567
HERE...

19:19.710 --> 19:20.904
- I'M SORRY
THAT I YELLED AT YOU.

19:21.050 --> 19:24.110
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'M SORRY I POURED WATER ON YOU.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.320
JUST GO BACK
TO SLEEP, OKAY?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.883
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

19:35.450 --> 19:38.305
- THIS SAND, IT'S NOT--
- LET IT GO.

19:38.450 --> 19:39.781
- I DON'T EVEN THINK
I LIKE THIS FONT.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.273
IT'S, LIKE, TOO SPORTY.
- LET IT GO, ALL RIGHT?

19:42.420 --> 19:43.751
JUST--
- I CAN'T LET IT GO.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.208
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM--

19:45.350 --> 19:47.238
THEY HAVEN'T SAID ONE THING.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.312
HOW--HOW CAN
YOU BE SO CALM?

19:49.460 --> 19:50.449
- 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR ASS
ON THE LINE AND NOT MINE.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.000
- [scoffs] THANKS.
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.209
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING,
SO JUST LET IT GO.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.463
- OH, MY GOD, I JUST--

19:56.600 --> 19:58.909
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA--
I'M SO...

19:59.050 --> 20:01.564
I'M GONNA CRY.
[sighs]

20:01.710 --> 20:03.985
- NOT FOR REAL, THOUGH, RIGHT?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRY, RIGHT?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.507
- IF I GET BAD NEWS, I'M GONNA
ABSOLUTELY START CRYING.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.641
I'M--

20:08.790 --> 20:11.611
- CAN'T YOU CONTROL THAT?
- NO, I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.853
HOW CAN I CONTROL
MY HUMAN EMOTIONS?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.060
IF I GET BAD NEWS ON THE PHONE,
I'M GOING TO START CRYING.

20:17.210 --> 20:18.370
- MAYBE HE WON'T USE THE PHONE.
MAYBE HE'LL EMAIL YOU.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.318
- [chuckles]
GREAT.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.451
I'LL JUST CRY
AT MY EMAIL, THEN.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.831
NOPE, NOTHING.
NOTHING, NOTHING.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.902
UGH.

20:29.050 --> 20:30.187
[sighs]

20:30.330 --> 20:32.707
IT'S JUST--
THE WAITING IS THE WORST.

20:32.850 --> 20:33.771
- BUT IT'S GOOD, THOUGH.
IT'S GOOD, SO JUST RELAX.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.535
- WHY IS IT GOOD?
- JUST RELAX.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.910
- [mumbles dejectedly]

20:40.230 --> 20:41.606
- JUST RELAX.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.929
- H-HANK?

20:57.180 --> 20:58.693
- WHAT?
I MEAN, YOU LOOKED DISGRUNTLED.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.286
YOU LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE STRESSED OUT.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.590
- NO, I AM.
IAM.

21:02.740 --> 21:05.538
- I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED
TO JUST--FORGET IT.

21:05.670 --> 21:06.773
FORGET IT. WORK YOURSELF UP.
- NO, THANK YOU.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.808
- WORK YOURSELF
INTO A LITTLE TIZZY.

21:08.950 --> 21:10.508
- [sighs]

21:10.640 --> 21:12.813
- I JUST--I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU

21:12.960 --> 21:14.882
THE WRONG IDEA, 'CAUSE...
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.

21:15.030 --> 21:16.679
WE'RE GOOD. YOU'RE NOT
GIVING ME THE WRONG IDEA.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.026
- OKAY.
- NO, WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT.

21:18.170 --> 21:20.229
WE'RE NOT GOOD. I DO.
I DO HAVE THE WRONG IDEA.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.824
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:21.970 --> 21:23.517
- THERE'S A MILLION
BRAVERMANS OUT THERE, RIGHT?

21:23.660 --> 21:25.412
EVERY CORNER,
THERE'S A BRAVERMAN.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.822
THEY'RE LIKE STARBUCKS,
THE BRAVERMANS.

21:26.970 --> 21:28.619
BUT YOU COME HERE.
YOU COME TO ME EVERY TIME.

21:28.770 --> 21:29.589
WHY? WHY?

21:29.730 --> 21:31.698
I'M GETTING THE WRONG IDEA.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.115
I GOT THE WRONG IDEA
BECAUSE YOU COME IN HERE,

21:34.250 --> 21:35.592
AND YOU'RE VULNERABLE.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.458
YOU'RE--YOU'RE NEEDY,

21:37.600 --> 21:40.706
AND I-I-I WANT TO BE THERE
FOR YOU BECAUSE I...

21:40.850 --> 21:41.532
BE--

21:41.670 --> 21:43.774
I-I WANT TO BE HERE,

21:43.920 --> 21:45.399
AND--AND IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU WANT ME TO BE HERE.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.464
- I DO, I DO, AS...

21:48.610 --> 21:50.749
MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW?

21:50.890 --> 21:51.993
- [scoffs]
- I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS SO--

21:52.130 --> 21:54.644
- OH, YEAH,
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.616
FRIENDS.
- NO, BUT--

21:59.760 --> 22:00.863
- HMM.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.035
[cell phone chimes]
- AH!

22:07.180 --> 22:09.148
OOH, OOH, OOH.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.144
AH! OH.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.394
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:13.530 --> 22:16.158
"SARAH, CAN YOU MEET
ME TOMORROW AT 4:00?

22:16.300 --> 22:17.426
ALEC."

22:17.570 --> 22:19.674
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:19.820 --> 22:21.367
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:21.510 --> 22:23.603
DO YOU THINK IT'S BAD?

22:23.750 --> 22:27.379
- I CAN'T BE HERE
FOR YOU ANYMORE, SARAH.

22:28.760 --> 22:32.059
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW.
IT'S, UH...

22:32.790 --> 22:36.100
[sighs]
IT'S CONFUSING.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.722
I JUST DON'T
WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.048
- Ml_Vl-HMM.
[glggleSJ

22:51.190 --> 22:53.533
- ALL CASH, 30-DAY ESCROW,

22:53.680 --> 22:56.433
JUST BELOW ASKING.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.332
- WOW.
- MM

22:58.480 --> 22:59.811
[laughs]

22:59.960 --> 23:01.541
- WE THOUGHT HE HATED IT.
- NO, HE DID NOT HATE IT.

23:01.690 --> 23:04.375
HE LOVED IT, LOVED IT.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.714
SHOULD I GET THE CHAMPAGNE?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.066
- IF HE LOVED IT SO MUCH,

23:07.210 --> 23:08.757
WHY DIDN'T HE MAKE
THE FULL OFFER, THEN?

23:08.900 --> 23:10.629
- OH, WELL, IT'S--
IT'S NOT THAT FAR OFF,

23:10.760 --> 23:11.624
AND IT'S ALL CASH.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.274
NO BANKS, QUICK CLOSE.

23:14.420 --> 23:17.662
THIS IS AN AMAZING OFFER.

23:17.810 --> 23:20.529
- WELL, I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S EASIER FOR YOU.

23:20.670 --> 23:21.944
- [chuckles]
- ZEEK.

23:22.090 --> 23:23.660
- THERE'S NO OPEN HOUSES,
NO ADVERTISING.

23:23.810 --> 23:24.947
I MEAN, I KNOW
HOW THESE THINGS WORK.

23:25.090 --> 23:28.912
LOOK, UM, I SAY
WE TAKE THE FULL ASK,

23:29.060 --> 23:30.573
OR WE DON'T BUDGE.

23:30.710 --> 23:34.191
- I THINK THAT WE'RE,
BOTH OF US,

23:34.340 --> 23:36.808
IN A LITTLE
SHOCK RIGHT NOW,

WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO DINNER,

24:24.180 --> 24:26.626
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MAX STARTED FREAKING OUT.

24:26.770 --> 24:28.738
HE WAS YELLING AND SWEARING.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.074
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:30.220 --> 24:32.017
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
MELT DOWN LIKE THAT.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.878
- OH, MY GOD.
HE FREAKED OUT.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.295
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID HE SAY WHAT HAPPENED?

24:36.440 --> 24:39.056
- NO, HE'S--HE'S CALM NOW,

24:39.200 --> 24:40.462
BUT HE'S SITTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOBBY,

24:40.610 --> 24:43.124
AND I...

24:43.270 --> 24:44.680
I CAN'T GET HIM TO MOVE.

24:44.820 --> 24:47.380
- UM, CAN YOU PUT HIM
ON THE PHONE FOR ME, PLEASE?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.442

25:26.800 --> 25:28.176
I LEFT MY BASEBALL MITT
IN HIS CAR.

25:28.310 --> 25:29.481

IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!
_ NO--

25:46.300 --> 25:48.268

GO TO YOUR ROOM!

25:59.690 --> 26:02.511
[sad music]

26:15.020 --> 26:16.942
- WHEN I FINISHED
AT SYRACUSE, THAT'S--

26:17.090 --> 26:18.637
THAT'S WHEN
I DECIDED TO COME OUT HERE

26:18.780 --> 26:21.248
TO GO TO BERKELEY
TO GET MY PhD.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.085
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S A VERY SWEET SCHOOL,

26:24.230 --> 26:24.958
VERY PROGRESSIVE.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.647
I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT.

26:28.860 --> 26:32.409
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

26:32.550 --> 26:34.689
- MAX?

WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HIM,

26:40.250 --> 26:41.387

26:44.560 --> 26:48.280
SO, UH, WHAT--
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE?

26:48.430 --> 26:49.977
- HONESTLY, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SURE.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.736
I THINK MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER
KIDS WERE MESSING WITH HIM.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.359
IT USUALLY DOESN'T AFFECT HIM,

26:54.500 --> 26:56.673
BUT, UH--BUT SOMETHING
JUST FLIPPED IN HIM

26:56.820 --> 26:58.151
LIKE A--
LIKE A SWITCH, YOU KNOW?

26:58.300 --> 27:00.291
HE WAS--HE WAS SCREAMING

27:00.440 --> 27:03.614
AND THRASHING AROUND AND--
- SO IT WAS PRETTY BAD?

27:03.760 --> 27:05.955
- IT WAS BAD.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.988
- OH.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.587
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE USED TO HAVE
THESE REALLY BAD TANTRUMS...

27:11.730 --> 27:13.345
- YEAH?

27:13.490 --> 27:15.003
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW?

27:15.150 --> 27:16.139
I JUST--I THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS PAST THIS STAGE,

27:16.280 --> 27:18.282
BUT I GUESS
IT'S NEVER OVER, SO...

27:18.420 --> 27:20.217
UH, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.112
THANKS A LOT
FOR STAYING HERE WITH HIM.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.148
I KNOW IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
EASY AFTER SEEING THAT.

27:24.290 --> 27:27.919
- MAX IS--IS A COOL DUDE,
YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE TIME.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.186
AND HONESTLY,
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS,

27:29.330 --> 27:32.151
BUT A LOT OF THESE KIDS--
THEY'RE JACKASSES.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.052
- WELL...
- YOU KNOW, I-I TRY TO--

27:34.200 --> 27:37.499
I TRY TO STEP IN WHERE I CAN,
BUT IT'S--IT'S GOTTEN BAD.

27:37.650 --> 27:40.642
I THINK THAT NEXT YEAR
IS GONNA BE MUCH BETTER.

27:40.790 --> 27:41.518
I REALLY DO.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.753
- I HOPE SO.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.060
- IT WILL.
- LISTEN, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

27:45.210 --> 27:47.007
THANKS FOR SITTING WITH HIM.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.348
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
WAS I THINKING?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.593
I SHOULD HAVE BUILT
THIS THING 30 YEARS--

28:31.740 --> 28:33.662
I MEAN...

28:33.810 --> 28:35.323
REALLY?

28:35.470 --> 28:38.746
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE 44 YEARS?

28:38.880 --> 28:41.223
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TIME?

28:44.100 --> 28:47.069
- THE HOUSE
WAS SO DIFFERENT THEN.

28:47.200 --> 28:51.204
THERE WAS AN OAK TREE THERE
WHERE THE BARN IS, REMEMBER?

28:51.350 --> 28:54.035
- YEAH.

28:54.180 --> 28:56.899
- I LOVED THAT TREE.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.247

WHEN IT GOT THAT...

29:02.740 --> 29:05.311
DREADFUL...

29:05.460 --> 29:08.395
WHAT WAS--
SOME KIND OF OAK DISEASE, RIGHT?

29:08.530 --> 29:10.919
OAK TREE DISEASE?

29:12.850 --> 29:15.501
- NO.

29:15.650 --> 29:16.912
- YEAH.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.709
- NO, THE TREE
DIDN'T HAVE A DISEASE, MILLE.

29:18.860 --> 29:21.647
SEE, I WANTED
TO BUILD THE BARN THERE,

29:21.790 --> 29:23.189
AND I KNEW
YOU LOVED THE TREE,

29:23.340 --> 29:25.615
SO I TOLD YOU IT HAD A DISEASE,
AND THEN I CUT IT DOWN.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.991
- YOU DID NOT.
- YEAH, I DID.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.859

IT IN SO LONG TOO.

29:42.780 --> 29:43.667

29:43.810 --> 29:46.938
- REALLY?
- WELL, YEAH.

29:47.090 --> 29:49.809
I MEAN, GOD, YOU KNOW, THIS GUY
WHO WANTS TO BUY THE PLACE--

29:49.960 --> 29:52.292
HE CALLED
MY BARN "A SHED."

29:52.440 --> 29:53.748
YOU KNOW,
IT'S GONNA GET TORN DOWN.

29:53.890 --> 29:56.302
HE'LL PROBABLY
REPLANT SOME KIND

29:56.440 --> 29:58.579
OF A SCRUB OAK
OR SOMETHING.

29:58.720 --> 30:02.133
I DON'T KNOW.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.794
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

30:07.840 --> 30:12.243
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

30:12.390 --> 30:14.255
- I MEAN, I STILL WANT TO SELL.
THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

30:14.390 --> 30:18.110
BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S JUST SO FAST.

30:18.260 --> 30:19.397
- HMM.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.599
- NOW WE HAVE CROSBY
AND HIS FAMILY LIVING HERE.

30:21.750 --> 30:25.390
I DON'T KNOW.

30:25.540 --> 30:28.885
VICTOR'S COUNTING ON FINISHING
THAT CAR WITH YOU TOO.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.449
I'D HATE TO TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM HIM.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.332
- MM-HMM.

30:36.550 --> 30:38.825
YEAH, I MEAN,
THE OFFER CAME IN PRETTY QUICK.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.552
I GUESS
THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS, BUT...

30:41.700 --> 30:44.931
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE, IS THERE?

30:46.980 --> 30:49.528
- SO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE IT?

30:50.840 --> 30:53.013
- [sighs]

30:53.160 --> 30:57.153
MILLE, I WANT WHAT YOU WANT.

31:05.070 --> 31:07.538

ON THE MARKET IN...

31:14.350 --> 31:15.510
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS,

31:15.660 --> 31:19.039

PLANNED TO DO...

31:19.180 --> 31:21.876
WHEN WE'RE READY.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.464
- IT'S A NICE FIRE, ISN'T IT?

31:37.510 --> 31:39.683
- YES.

31:39.820 --> 31:42.584
IT'S A GOOD FIRE PIT.

31:47.760 --> 31:51.344
- [sighs]

31:51.490 --> 31:52.934
MAX.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.524
BUDDY--
- I SAID I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

31:54.670 --> 31:55.762
- I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,

31:55.910 --> 31:58.140
BUT WE'VE BEEN DRIVING
FOR OVER TWO HOURS,

31:58.290 --> 31:59.496
AND I THINK
YOUR DAD AND I CAN HELP

31:59.640 --> 32:01.084
IF YOU EXPLAIN
TO US WHAT HAPPENED.

32:01.220 --> 32:01.800
- CAN WE TURN ON
THE RADIO?

32:01.950 --> 32:04.601
- [sighs]

32:04.750 --> 32:06.365
- YEAH.

32:06.510 --> 32:09.297
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
WE CAN WAIT TILL WE GET HOME.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.920
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT THEN.

32:12.060 --> 32:16.440
[music playing faintly
on the radio]

32:16.580 --> 32:18.719
- WHY DO
ALL THE OTHER KIDS HATE ME?

32:21.280 --> 32:23.510
- HONEY, NOBODY HATES YOU.
- THEY'RE JUST IDIOTS.

32:23.660 --> 32:27.653
- NOBODY HATES YOU.
- IS IT BECAUSE I'M WEIRD?

32:27.800 --> 32:31.452
- [laughs]
- HONEY, YOU'RE NOT WEIRD, OKAY?

32:31.600 --> 32:33.215
I THINK SOMETIMES--
I DON'T KNOW--

32:33.360 --> 32:35.703
KIDS DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR ASPERGER'S,

32:35.850 --> 32:40.128
AND THEY MISINTERPRET IT
AS BEING WEIRD OR WHATEVER.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.579
BUT YOU'RE NOT WEIRD.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.292
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SO SMART,
AND YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.884
- IF I'M SMART AND HILARIOUS,

32:46.030 --> 32:48.715
THEN WHY DO
THEY HATE ME?

32:48.860 --> 32:50.919
- THEY...

32:51.070 --> 32:53.277
THEY DON'T HATE YOU.

32:53.410 --> 32:55.890
I PROMISE.
- TREVOR PEED IN MY CANTEEN.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.133
- I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.692
- HE SAID HE DID IT
BECAUSE I'M A FREAK.

33:03.840 --> 33:08.903
I AM A WEIRDO FREAK.
- YOU'RE NOT A FREAK.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.256
- I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.606
- NO, HE'S AN ASSHOLE, MAX.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.198
- HE'S AN IDIOT.
YOU'RE NOT A FREAK, HONEY.

33:15.330 --> 33:17.013
- I THINK I AM A FREAK.

33:21.650 --> 33:24.642
I TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM,
BUT I CAN'T.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.035
ASPERGER'S IS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME SMART.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.000
BUT IF I'M SMART,
THEN WHY...

33:38.360 --> 33:41.659
WHY DON'T I GET
WHY THEY'RE LAUGHING AT ME?

33:43.710 --> 33:45.769
THEY ALL DO IT,
EVEN THE NICE KIDS,

33:45.920 --> 33:48.059
EVEN MICAH.

33:54.130 --> 33:57.054
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.189
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.717

WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS SITUATION OUT, YOU KNOW?

THAT YOU AND MOM GOT SEPARATED?

39:23.360 --> 39:26.079
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

39:26.220 --> 39:28.393

BEFORE I MOVED IN WITH YOU GUYS,

I KNOW.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.754
YOU ARE NOT READY
TO SELL THE HOUSE.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.470
AND ORDINARILY, I'D BE VERY
RESPECT FUL OF THAT DECISION.

40:56.620 --> 40:57.894
- ORDINARILY?

40:58.040 --> 41:00.656
- BUT ORDINARILY,
I DON'T GET AN OFFER THIS GOOD.

HIGHER THAN ASKING.

RIGHT THERE.
- OH, MY GOD.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.013
- "OH, MY GOD" IS RIGHT.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.469
THAT WOULD BE A RECORD
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

41:16.610 --> 41:18.817
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY
BUY ME THAT VACATION TO HAWAII

41:18.950 --> 41:20.599
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED,
BUT DON'T LET ME INFLUENCE YOU.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.536
- OH, MY GOD.
- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.090

A LOT OF THINKING TO DO.
