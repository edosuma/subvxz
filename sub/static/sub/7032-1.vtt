(Panting)

00:21.063 --> 00:25.358
(Jess) You know it's funny, I don't
remember getting pregnant with you or...

00:26.360 --> 00:31.906
Oh, God. And I didn't marry you
but somehow we're in this together.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.366
(Jess grunts)

00:33.492 --> 00:37.537
(Midwife) Is there anyone else I can call?
(Jess) The bloody morphine man.

00:37.663 --> 00:42.917
- It's too late for drugs now.
- It's never too late for drugs.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.003
(Jess) Kill me.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.047
Just kill me.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.300
That's it, breathe.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.803
(Jess moans)

00:59.852 --> 01:01.686
(Jess) 'Ah, childbirth.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.272
'The most beautiful experience
of a woman's life.'

01:04.397 --> 01:07.650
- It's OK. You're in control.
- I'm in agony!

01:07.776 --> 01:09.360
'Marginally less painful

01:09.486 --> 01:11.571
'than having your nose hacked off
with a shovel.'

01:11.697 --> 01:13.698
Breathe, Jess. Breathe.

01:13.824 --> 01:17.243
- I want Milly.
- Who? Who is Milly?

01:17.369 --> 01:20.121
'Milly, my best friend.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.623
'Although a proper friend
would have prevented me

01:22.750 --> 01:25.042
'from ever having sex in the first place.

01:25.169 --> 01:29.005
'I met Milly when my dad got transferred
from Oregon to London.'

01:29.131 --> 01:32.300
(Teacher) OK, everybody.
Here is our new girl. Jess.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.093
All the way from America.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.220
Hey, guys. Nice to meet you.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.723
- Nice accent.
- "I'm American."

01:39.933 --> 01:42.810
OK. What do we know about America?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.270
Milly.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.023
They've got electric chairs. Zzz!

01:50.778 --> 01:54.989
'Milly took pity on me
and taught me how to speak proper English.'

01:55.115 --> 01:57.325
Bloody bleeding bumhole bugger arse!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.076
- You've got it.
- Yay!

02:01.872 --> 02:04.165
'Milly's mum was a TV actress.'

02:04.291 --> 02:05.708
Milly.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.586
So how does mummy look?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.420
Like a right old tart.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.840
Back to your homework.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.968
"Mr Heathcliff had..."

02:16.094 --> 02:19.806
"...an erect and handsome figure."

02:19.932 --> 02:21.808
(Boy) Hello, ladies.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.851
Do you wanna come check out my big throne?

02:25.521 --> 02:27.688
'We did everything together.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.691
'First kisses.'

02:33.654 --> 02:34.862
We kissed a boy!

02:34.988 --> 02:37.740
'First sexual encounters...'

02:42.329 --> 02:46.707
(Chanting) Get your tits out.
Get your tits out for the lads!

03:03.642 --> 03:05.977
Milly! What are you doing?

03:06.103 --> 03:09.647
Jess! I just had sex!

03:11.984 --> 03:14.694
'First little bundle of joy.'

03:18.198 --> 03:19.699
Kit.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.117
All right, ladies?

03:26.123 --> 03:28.666
Congratulations. Who's the dad?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.293
I'm kidding.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.420
She's not.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.299
That's excellent.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.344
That's excellent.
We're gonna have a family!

03:40.470 --> 03:42.305
We're gonna have a family!

03:42.431 --> 03:46.601
'And because Milly
liked to be the first at everything...

03:59.907 --> 04:04.076
' ...Milly's roadie
turned into a family man with a plan.'

04:05.203 --> 04:07.538
Soundz!

04:07.664 --> 04:09.749
- Soundz!
- Soundz!

04:10.709 --> 04:11.709
'A really good plan.'

04:11.793 --> 04:13.669
Get the speakers in.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.463
Sell the speakers, that's it.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.130
Get the baby bump.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.345
'While I got busy
trying to make the world a better place.'

04:24.097 --> 04:27.308
OK. Scarlett, we're gonna plant
those tomatoes next. OK?

04:27.434 --> 04:32.980
'And I fell for someone who looked
way better than me in a tool belt.'

04:33.106 --> 04:34.386
Sorry, mate. Sorry, mate. Sorry.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.692
Are you all right?
Sorry, mate.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.155
Shit.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.199
(Kit) When is the second truck coming?

04:43.325 --> 04:46.494
- (Milly) What truck?
- With your shoe collection.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.287
(Milly) And your hair products.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.789
Oh, Juliet.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.792
Oh, I love my house! This is my house!

04:52.918 --> 04:55.586
Our house. Me and the kids
are gonna live here, too.

04:55.712 --> 04:59.382
- I think we should christen this room.
- I think we should christen every room.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.306
Kiss me.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.185
'Milly actually became
a wonderful mother.'

05:11.311 --> 05:13.062
- I love you.
- Love you.

05:13.188 --> 05:17.400
- (Milly) Ben, show dad how to do it. Go on.
- How do you make it wiggle?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.486
- Oh, my God.
- You're so good at it.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.613
'While I was still just an auntie.'

05:22.739 --> 05:24.490
Go home and make a baby with Jago.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.659
- We're trying.
- It's the best part.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.203
'And though Milly
wasn't always entirely appropriate...'

05:29.329 --> 05:33.791
Thank you all for coming
to celebrate my mother's life...

05:33.917 --> 05:37.378
'...she was always there.'

05:37.504 --> 05:39.255
I'm so sorry.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.682
(Scarlet) Happy birthday, Auntie Jess.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.938
- Ready?
- Bet the flash doesn't work.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.314
Happy birthday!

05:58.775 --> 06:02.653
'I didn't have many pictures
that Milly wasn't in.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.409
'Until now.'

06:21.131 --> 06:23.674
(Milly) Hiya.
(Dr Butala) Hello you.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.634
(Dr Butala) Come, sit down.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.721
So, Milly.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.058
I know, I forgot to come
back for my check-up.

06:32.184 --> 06:37.146
The breast lump biopsy
shows that the lump is malignant.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.316
OK?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.820
Now we will need to run
further investigations.

06:44.946 --> 06:49.742
A CT scan, staging chest, abdomen
and pelvis to see if it's spread.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.245
We'll also look at your lymph nodes.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.209
But for now, what we can do
is plan your chemotherapy regime.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.971
That's it, is it?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.307
You promised me you'd eat some green.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.686
Just cheese and bread. That's all
you're gonna eat is cheese and bread?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.733
Give mummy a kiss.
What's up with mummy?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.777
You haven't touched your food.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.864
Have something.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.094
(Jago) Hey, isn't today a fertile day?

07:50.220 --> 07:53.597
You up for a quick spooge before work?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.057
Maybe.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.739
Oh, wait.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.534
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait? What for?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.203
Why, what?

08:18.707 --> 08:21.542
What's that?
Some kind of laptop for our hamster?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.878
It's my new fertility monitor.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.124
I pee on it first thing in the morning
and it tells me if I'm ovulating or not.

08:27.174 --> 08:32.344
Heaven forbid we actually have sex
for the fun of it one of these days.

08:33.388 --> 08:37.600
Well what if we keep trying and trying
and it just never works?

08:37.726 --> 08:42.020
Eventually you're gonna go off
and make babies with some 22-year-old.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.732
You mean you're not 22?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.693
You lying cow.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.362
- Your eggs are ready.
- (Bleep)

08:51.865 --> 08:53.407
Not according to this.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.386
- (Kit) You seen my tuxedo trousers?
- Dry-cleaning bag.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.349
Bastard black tie events.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.435
- I bet Jago's not wearing a tux.
- He'd better be.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.854
Stop moaning.
Nobody's gonna be looking at you anyway.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.940
- You're just a handbag holder.
- (Miranda) Milly.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.985
I think Ben's got head L-I-C-E.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.613
Oh, Jesus.
As soon as they start back at school.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.339
- Every bloody term.
- (Miranda) Well you have to fumigate, Milly.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.700
I didn't sign up for this.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.619
(Ben screams)

09:38.745 --> 09:40.246
The nits are sucking out my brain.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.790
(Miranda) Let me dry your hair.
Back in the bathroom.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.876
My mother is sucking out my brain meat.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.420
It was your bright idea
to have her move near us.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.256
I was blinded by the thought
of free babysitting.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.216
(Miranda) Oh my God,
Scarlett's got them too.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.760
Ow, Nana. Get off.

09:54.886 --> 09:59.974
It's not nana, sweetie. It's Miranda.
Milly, you have to comb through the kids' hair.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.810
- Doesn't she, Kit?
- Absolutely.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.336
Fine. I'll deal with the head lice,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.772
you go to the benefit
and take care of 200 VIPs.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.774
You look stunning.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.567
But you've got to get them out more.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.529
Mum, I'm a PR executive,
not a sex worker.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.740
- Oh, well...
- This is what was in the dry-cleaning bag.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.661
Oh my God, Dad.
Why are you wearing girl's jeggings?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.247
Can we sack the dry-cleaner?

10:23.373 --> 10:26.166
- They pop if you squeeze them.
- (Kit) Disgusting.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.503
Ben, stop it! All nitty children
back in the bathroom. Go, go, go.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.255
(Man) 'Because of your support...

10:31.381 --> 10:34.967
'we've given over 260,000 people
safe, clean water.'

10:35.093 --> 10:37.886
We're gonna do even more.
Help us build wells tonight.

10:41.558 --> 10:45.102
Hello. I'm so happy to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.645
Have a fabulous evening.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.691
Do not get drunk
and bid on shit we can't afford.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.317
OK. How about if I get really drunk
but don't bid on anything?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.818
- Deal.
- OK.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.114
(All) Hey!

10:57.240 --> 11:01.410
OK, OK. Please, tonight, just try
not to embarrass me for once. I am working.

11:01.536 --> 11:06.165
- By the way, you look amazing.
- Not enough tits out according to my mother.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.750
She's the expert.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.337
Oh God. All right, I gotta go persuade
all these rich people to flash their cash.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.005
Milly. Er...

11:13.131 --> 11:14.771
Actually, right now I'd like you to react

11:14.883 --> 11:19.762
as if I've said something humanitarian
yet hilarious.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.644
Happy Valentine's, sexy.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.279
Little gift to yourself?

11:37.405 --> 11:40.657
Nope. I'm already wearing mine.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.456
(Jago) All right, I'm off.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.251
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh, what?

11:53.922 --> 11:56.590
Sweetheart, you know I think it's all a
load of commercialised bollocks, right?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.217
Yes, I do.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.596
Hey...

12:02.722 --> 12:03.889
I've been thinking

12:04.015 --> 12:06.892
and maybe we should put
all our eggs in one...

12:07.018 --> 12:10.312
...test tube. You know,
go in for the old fertility treatment.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.148
But we didn't qualify for free treatment.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.394
I'm not talking about doing it
on the National Health.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.742
You're going on the oil rig again.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.745
- Only for a short stint.
- No. They're the worst.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.623
- Yeah, that's why they pay the most.
- I don't even take aspirin.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.959
I hate the thought of all
those horrible drugs.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.837
Yeah, I hate the thought of wanking-off
into a plastic cup,

12:34.963 --> 12:38.549
but if it means that we produce an heir
to our extensive power tool collection

12:38.675 --> 12:41.385
it'll all be worthwhile. Hey...

12:44.305 --> 12:45.472
...happy Valentine's Day.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.230
Drill bits.

12:54.941 --> 12:55.941
(Purrs)

12:57.694 --> 12:59.027
Will you think about it?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.657
OK.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.924
(Dialing tone)

13:22.635 --> 13:25.762
- (Jess) 'Hi.'
- Hey. What are you up to at lunch-time?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.556
Working lunch.

13:27.682 --> 13:31.727
Team bonding with the sex gods
from Water and Sanitation.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.687
Oh, OK.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.063
Is everything OK?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.609
'Milly?'

13:42.238 --> 13:46.200
You found out a week ago?
And you haven't told Kit yet?

13:47.118 --> 13:51.413
I have to have chemotherapy.
Like straight away.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.581
I'm gonna be bald.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.334
Lots of people are bald.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.337
Men are bald, yes. Babies. ET.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.006
Not me.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.468
- They might take my tits away.
- They haven't said that yet.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.094
Not for sure.

14:07.514 --> 14:12.226
I mean, how much cancer can you have?
You've had all your check-ups.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.146
- Well, I've been busy.
- Oh, Jesus.

14:16.272 --> 14:21.235
- How could the tumour have gotten so big?
- It's aggressive, like you. Jesus.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.238
- Well, is it contained?
- In my body, yes.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.283
- You should've gone back sooner.
- Yeah, thanks. Hadn't figured that out.

14:28.409 --> 14:32.162
You're right, that was
a really stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.622
Is it too late?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.252
To put these in the wash.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.718
- You have to think positively.
- (Milly) Oh God, if I die...

14:49.222 --> 14:51.723
- If you say that again...
- Well...

14:51.849 --> 14:53.350
Don't say that.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.396
It's all gonna be OK.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.192
I can't believe we're laughing.
I can't believe we're laughing.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.738
(Milly) I don't want them
to have to go through it.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.699
They won't have to.
They're not going to.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.450
They're gonna watch me go through it

15:10.577 --> 15:13.370
and have all sorts of shit to deal
with when they're older.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.414
We're gonna make it
extra wonderful for them.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.874
We'll look after them so much.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.377
You've made them into such wonderful kids.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.400
The lovely nurse puts chemotherapy
into the IV drip.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.153
And the medicine is like
an army of soldiers

15:46.279 --> 15:47.904
and they all march into mummy's body.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.240
(All chant)
Left right, left right, left right.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.036
Now, chemo soldiers,
they shoot the bad cancer out.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.456
I want chemotherapy!

15:58.666 --> 16:00.186
(Milly) The soldiers are a bit rubbish

16:00.251 --> 16:02.753
so they also shoot parts of mummy's body
that aren't poorly

16:02.879 --> 16:04.713
and this makes mummy feel ill.

16:04.839 --> 16:05.922
Oh!

16:06.049 --> 16:07.633
And just to be very, very safe

16:07.759 --> 16:11.345
the soldiers might zap out
all of mummy's big hair.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.388
But all this is so mummy will get better.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.057
(All) Yay!

16:15.183 --> 16:18.894
And that, my gorgeous family,
is chemotherapy.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.395
Very good, Mummy.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.945
Good plan?

16:29.072 --> 16:32.157
No. You go, I'll be fine.
I've got Jess to order around.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.659
What's new?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.744
I'll get the kids from your mum.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.044
OK, I've got magazines, nail art,

16:44.170 --> 16:45.629
funny animals on YouTube.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.840
Oh! I've got a sexy bed.
Did you bring a vibrator?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.635
- Yes, several.
- Yes!

16:54.764 --> 16:56.223
Jess, this is Nurse Sam.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.934
Nurse Sam, this is Jess,
my elderly companion.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.603
Sam, I want a blue cap.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.314
Just so you know,
with your type of chemo

17:04.440 --> 17:06.983
there's only about a 20% chance
it'll save your hair.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.819
And some find it quite painful.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.612
Worked for me.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.948
- Get me the blue cap.
- She wants the blue cap.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.950
She's getting the blue cap.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.329
(Jess) Wow, that is a big prick.

17:20.455 --> 17:25.167
(Sam) Yeah, I know, bit of a monster.
OK, Milly.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.549
- Oh, it's a beautiful vein.
- Yay, I have beautiful veins.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.635
(Jess) Always thought
you had beautiful veins.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.557
You kind of look like a superhero.

17:38.683 --> 17:43.395
I just can't place which one
and I can't tell if you're good or bad.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.314
It... it... may be Captain America.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.651
May be Aquagirl.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.739
(Milly) Whichever one it
is lives in an igloo.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.491
- (Jess) Is it cold?
- I have an ice-cream headache,

17:56.617 --> 18:01.455
as though I've eaten the entire shop
out of their ice-lollies.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.168
(Jess) Definitely Captain America.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.969
'The chemo took forever.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.724
'My job, Milly said, was to turn up with
treats and try not to be annoying.'

18:20.850 --> 18:23.643
(Sam) So, Jess, you're in charge of these.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.395
Recycled vomit bowls?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.314
We won't need those
because I took my meds.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.567
I might need one after seeing
that enormo needle go into your veins.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.360
- Do you want one of my pills?
- Yes.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.447
Girls, we're not at Glastonbury.
You can't just swap pills.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.740
Oh, you spoilsport.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.202
(Sam) Yeah, well look, anti-nausea tablets
work for 80% of patients.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.288
But just in case Milly's
in the special 20%... Hey!

18:43.414 --> 18:47.042
Highly technical equipment.
Thank you.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.628
Good. Keep an eye on her.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.214
Thank you, Sam.
Oh, nice hat.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.720
(Man) How are we gonna
reboot his image?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.726
(Kira) Easy.
We just need loads of charity work.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.140
And children, doctors.
Maybe go to hospitals...

19:02.266 --> 19:04.601
Kira, let's hear from Milly.

19:04.727 --> 19:09.439
We could start by encouraging him
not to cheat on his wife with a dominatrix.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.443
(Man) I mean I tried to kill that story.

19:13.569 --> 19:17.030
(Woman) I even called the trades.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.324
(Man) What was that thing
about the statement

19:19.450 --> 19:22.452
that we made for the agent?
Was that you, Kira?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.079
Are you done, Sam?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.167
Shot.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.422
Oh, my God.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.472
(Jess) Burmese virgin hair.
Malaysian virgin hair.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.976
(Milly) That's me. I'm a Malaysian virgin.
(Jess) You wish.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.895
Mongolian virgin hair.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.607
God, Milly.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.068
Oh, these wigs are so expensive.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.238
Well, look at the state of me, Jess.
Money is no object.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.116
Everyone, this is Jill.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.661
The greatest wigmaker
Pinewood Studios ever had.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.580
Piss off, darling.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.082
(Jill) Hello, Milly.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.408
Now, I can make you something,

20:10.459 --> 20:13.003
but I think we should just play
with some of these wigs.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.129
Just to get the feel.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.089
- OK?
- OK.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.008
(Jill) Got a few ready for you.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.678
If you could just hold the front,
that would be great. Thank you.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.223
Of course we can style it any which way.

20:25.349 --> 20:29.936
Oh, sorry, that's a little bit
1980's political lesbian.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.188
Boring.

20:32.315 --> 20:35.859
(Jill) We have something
a little more exciting here.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.571
Oh, very Studio 54.
What do you think, Randy?

20:39.697 --> 20:42.407
- (Mouths) Randy?
- Darling, it's all a naked blur.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.784
- You like?
- (Jess) It's a little Goth.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.287
Yeah, it looks like I'm just gonna pop out
and drink some blood.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.289
(Jill) This won't do, will it?

20:49.415 --> 20:55.211
Is it OK if I just try this one?
Sorry, I've been eye-balling it.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.218
Oh my God.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.304
The sun actually will come out tomorrow,
Daddy Warbucks.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.056
Poodle perm.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.768
Jill, will you just please
make me not look bald.

21:09.894 --> 21:10.977
Colour?

21:11.103 --> 21:14.230
- Something that matches.
- Upstairs or downstairs?

21:14.357 --> 21:17.233
- Pubes are gone.
- Upstairs it is.

21:17.360 --> 21:22.697
Oh, I think I've got something rather
special that I made for a Scorsese film.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.824
- Scorsese film?
- (Jill) You're gonna love...

21:24.951 --> 21:27.452
Yes, it was a couple of years ago.

21:27.578 --> 21:30.205
- Darling, you never mentioned that.
- I e-mailed you.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.833
Bit tight, but that's gonna be OK.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.252
But wait a minute.

21:37.338 --> 21:41.132
A few nips and tucks,
I think it should be perfect.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.134
Yeah. That's the one.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.679
- Thank you.
- OK, my pleasure.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.722
(Miranda) Thank you, Jill.
(Jill) Just take that off.

21:47.848 --> 21:52.560
I kind of thought it would really work
and I think it has.

21:54.021 --> 21:59.567
Now, Milly, dear girl...
how about we just get rid of all this?

22:01.445 --> 22:04.406
- What, now?
- (Jill) It's all gonna go very soon, darling.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.409
Best avoid the insane asylum look.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.415
- Sure, why not?
- Good girl.

22:18.754 --> 22:23.216
- I think I'll put the kettle on.
- OK. I'll help.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.186
It's often those watching
who find it the hardest.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.066
Are you ready?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.776
Yeah.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.685
- I look like a leopard.
- What, a leper or a leopard?

23:28.324 --> 23:30.033
Would you like a lock, darling?

23:30.159 --> 23:31.785
Eugh! No.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.914
I agree, absolutely disgusting.
But some people get very sentimental.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.040
(Miranda) Thanks, Jess.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.049
It's unfair.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.718
You look so beautiful.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.263
Why thank you, Mum.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.063
Feels quite good.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.694
- Thank you, Jill.
- You look great.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.959
Cheese?
Cheese! I don't want shitty cheese.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.128
Excuse me, who taught you that word?

24:23.254 --> 24:26.714
- What, cheese?
- Yeah, really clever.

24:26.841 --> 24:27.924
He said the "F" ' word the other day.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.593
- Ben!
- Dad laughed.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.595
- Get dressed.
- You're not dressed.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.557
Ben! Mummy's still poorly.
Mum?

24:35.683 --> 24:37.559
Well, fit as a fiddle.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.562
Where's your swim bag? Where's Dad?

24:40.688 --> 24:43.481
- On the phone.
- Kit, I need some help here.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.775
(Kit) I'm on a work call.
The Hong Kong deal.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.277
Are you driving us?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.071
(Milly) Not today, sweetheart.
Daddy's gonna drop you off.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.449
- Ben put honey all down my T-shirt!
- (Milly) Ben!

24:53.576 --> 24:56.619
- Kit, can you sort Scarlett's shirt?
- Yes. Sorry, I've got a work crisis.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.789
Then tell Hong Kong Darren that I need you.
Play the cancer card.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.000
I've done that a million times.
I've got a splitting headache.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.626
Oh, poor baby.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.005
Scarlett, just go and get any clean shirt.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.048
I haven't got a clean shirt.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.509
- Oh, of course.
- It's on my list.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.637
Ever heard of multi-tasking?

25:14.763 --> 25:17.557
- Come on, I'll drive.
- (Ben) Yay!

25:17.683 --> 25:21.686
Not bald. Not in the bald hat.
Mum, what if my friends see?

25:21.812 --> 25:24.856
- Would you prefer I wear the sunhat?
- Not the sunhat.

25:24.982 --> 25:29.277
Come on. We paid a fortune for you to go
and splash water at each other. Hurry up!

25:29.403 --> 25:31.196
Piggyback to the car.

25:34.783 --> 25:35.783
Ben.

25:35.826 --> 25:39.704
- I told you mum wasn't better.
- I'm fine. I'll be fine.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.290
You all right?
Go back to bed, I'll drive them.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.136
Why didn't you say you were feeling unwell?

25:47.630 --> 25:50.757
You really don't know women, Dad.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.010
I'm not cooking that again.
That was a bit bland.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.470
- (Phone rings)
- Hi.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.223
'Hello? Milly?'

25:58.349 --> 26:00.266
(Milly) There should be a person.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.394
Excuse me?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.397
Someone who'll come over
and sort things out. Like...

26:09.318 --> 26:12.111
Gets the shopping in,
gets the kids off to school.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.738
Arranges play dates.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.908
Like a husband?
Sorry, I didn't mean to shit on Kit.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.328
Right.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.747
- What about your mum?
- 'Our Miranda'

26:22.873 --> 26:27.168
has very thoughtlessly got herself a job
on some crappy mini-series.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.170
Oh, she got the part
in "Shakespeare's Women".

26:29.296 --> 26:32.548
- Good for her.
- "Shakespeare's Shags" more like.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.594
Yeah, it's good for her.
Not for me.

26:38.931 --> 26:43.434
I have got to sleep.
My white blood cells are twatted.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.271
- I'll call you later?
- Yeah. Bye.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.899
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.538
- Where are you going?
- What?

27:03.664 --> 27:07.250
I think I should go over there
for a few days and help out.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.420
Don't you think you've done enough?

27:10.546 --> 27:12.797
We've already put off having the IVF.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.048
She doesn't know that.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.510
And, besides, WE decided
to postpone until after chemo.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.137
You decided.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.348
How much longer
are we gonna put our lives on hold?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.350
Well that's a super attitude, Jago.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.603
Have you even stopped for a second
to think about how Milly feels?

27:27.730 --> 27:29.230
What?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.816
I just want us to have a baby, Jess.

27:31.942 --> 27:35.194
Don't make me into the bastard for that.
Excuse me, please.

27:39.450 --> 27:43.202
OK, fine. I will start treatment.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.622
You can borrow the money
and then go on the rig and pay it back. OK?

27:46.749 --> 27:48.249
Jay!

27:53.505 --> 27:54.672
(Knocking on window)

27:57.760 --> 28:00.386
You stupid arse-crack.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.860
Sorry. Gonna try one more time.

28:15.986 --> 28:21.407
"He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect,
in dress and manners a gentleman.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.327
"Because he has an erect

28:24.453 --> 28:28.414
"and handsome figure
and rather morose."

28:28.540 --> 28:31.292
What do women see
in those pouty Mr Darcy types?

28:31.418 --> 28:32.502
Darcy?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.837
Heathcliff is a whole
other kettle of man-meat.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.423
Well you can check out this bit of man-meat
as he walks away.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.467
I've gotta go find a doctor.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.389
Sam!

28:45.974 --> 28:46.974
Wow!

28:47.017 --> 28:49.143
Stop it, please.
Don't ask me again. It's no.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.938
Ben, put the car down
and eat some greens.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.648
Why are you just pushing it around?
Eat some of the lettuce.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.900
- (Scarlett) Mummy!
- Mummy!

28:56.026 --> 28:57.402
- Hey, Mummy.
- Hello.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.862
- Why am I so popular?
- Dad's being mean.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.408
Oh, he is a very mean man,
that's why I married him.

29:03.534 --> 29:06.452
I told Scarlett
she couldn't have her ears pierced.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.748
Jade's got hers done. And Bianca's
getting them done this weekend.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.584
I'm like the only person
in my whole class who doesn't.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.230
So all the boys have got pierced ears?

29:15.295 --> 29:16.712
Felix and Archie have.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.173
I'll think about it over
the summer holidays.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.759
Oh, great.
That's good consistent parenting.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.469
Well, didn't say yes.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.235
How old were you when you had yours done?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.391
- Hmm... can't remember.
- Miranda says you were ten.

29:28.517 --> 29:32.770
- You didn't even tell her.
- Your grandmother is a dirty snitch.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.481
This needs some salt or something.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.485
Mmm. Why don't you take over
and I can go and finish off some work.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.946
Fine. As soon as I vomit
in this salad bowl.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.199
(Kit) Are you OK?

29:46.869 --> 29:50.663
- Shall I grab your pills?
- They don't work.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.669
Vitamin A. I just pureed some vegetables.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.338
So did I. Care to try some?

30:07.014 --> 30:10.266
- I'm not eating that.
- It's natural deodorant, sweetie.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.894
It's made from arrowroot
and shea butter.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.395
Maybe I will have some on toast.

30:14.521 --> 30:18.149
They think that aerosol deodorants
may cause breast cancer.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.610
Oh, and if I use that
it'll make the cancer go away?

30:25.115 --> 30:26.657
(Miranda) Ta-dum.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.661
Why have you brought me an outfit
from a 1970's sitcom?

30:30.787 --> 30:34.916
Darling, it's vintage.
To keep Kit interested.

30:35.042 --> 30:38.503
Sex is so important and he's awfully dishy.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.838
Well, I will make sure I do not wear that.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.799
But if that side of things
slides away, then...

30:43.926 --> 30:45.551
Then what?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.638
I've only got myself to blame?
Is that what you're saying?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.226
I'm trying, Milly.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.270
I know, Mum.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.481
(Milly) Oh!
(Woman) Yoo-hoo.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.567
- Nisha. Oh, my God.
- How lovely to see you.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.569
(Milly) Hi, Cheryl. Thank you.

31:07.491 --> 31:11.577
You are totally brilliant, Sam.
And I hope I never see you again.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.412
The feeling's mutual.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.999
Here, that's for you. Man-meat.

31:20.504 --> 31:24.632
- (Ben) Mum, we made food for you.
- Well, that's very kind of you.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.342
Nutella and crisp sandwiches.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.427
- And we bought you a new mug.
- (Scarlett) I made tea.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.930
Dad wouldn't let me boil the kettle
so it's hot tap.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.267
Mmm! Tap water tea.
Oh, thank you, children.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.770
I'm not too peckish at the minute, but...

31:37.896 --> 31:40.147
I think Auntie Jess is
and she would love a cup of tea.

31:40.274 --> 31:43.150
- I'll make her one.
- Oh, no, just give her mine.

31:43.277 --> 31:47.822
Ah, Nutella and crisps, you say?
On white bread?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.409
Mmm!

31:51.451 --> 31:54.662
Any... anything to report
on the old baby front?

31:56.456 --> 31:57.707
Well...

31:57.833 --> 32:01.544
We don't have sex any more.
We just attempt to reproduce.

32:01.670 --> 32:06.215
When the basal body temperature
and cervical mucus are aligned, then,

32:06.341 --> 32:09.969
and I mean only then,
am I allowed anywhere near the vagina.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.639
What about you and Milly?
Can she still...?

32:13.765 --> 32:14.765
No.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.810
But she's allowed me to have sex
with other girls whenever I want.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.062
- Very decent of her.
- Yeah.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.439
No, mate.

32:21.565 --> 32:24.609
She only finished
her last round of chemo today.

32:24.735 --> 32:28.613
- I'll at least leave it till the weekend.
- Yeah, give her a few days.

32:29.656 --> 32:34.327
Do you know, it'd probably be easier
if me and you just started having sex.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.165
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to say that?

32:40.500 --> 32:46.297
(Jess) "Injectable gonadotropins
regulates the final burst of egg growth.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.716
"Side effects include fatigue,
nausea, bloating."

32:48.842 --> 32:50.259
Great.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.390
Oh!

32:59.061 --> 33:01.896
Oh, look at you.
Like a modern Michelangelo.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.357
- Somebody's been hitting the gym.
- Good to see you.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.525
- You look hot.
- You, too, sweetie.

33:06.652 --> 33:07.818
Hello, honey.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.204
Knock knock.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.497
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hiya.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.749
I just wanted to give you a quick heads-up
on the last few days.

33:21.875 --> 33:22.875
Sure.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.087
We've signed a couple of big name clients.
We've got M.I.A. and The National.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.296
Yep, I got the e-mails.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.421
I just wanted to let you know
we're all here for you.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.261
- And your haircut looks amazing.
- It's a wig.

33:34.388 --> 33:37.390
I know. Welcome back.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.516
Thank you.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.702
(Jess) They've stolen all my eggs.
(Jago) You sound like the Easter Bunny.

33:57.828 --> 34:01.706
(Jess) Did you do your mucky business?
(Jago) Yeah.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.501
It was really difficult
getting it in that tiny pot.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.295
It was going everywhere.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.340
How much did you lose?
That could be our baby.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.466
Don't worry.

34:12.592 --> 34:16.137
I managed to scrape most of it
off the cubicle wall.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.139
At least I think it was mine.

34:26.148 --> 34:29.275
It works! High five. Hot lava.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.304
So, Milly, the treatment has worked.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.681
But? You've got the "but" voice on.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.892
The "it's worked but" voice.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.395
You know your oncologist
and I had hoped to proceed

35:06.521 --> 35:10.399
with a lumpectomy and radiation.
But based on all of your results

35:10.525 --> 35:13.736
we recommend, at this stage,
to proceed to mastectomy.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.827
No. Hmm-mm.

35:21.953 --> 35:27.082
Milly, this will give us our best chance
of eliminating the cancer.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.793
(Milly) Well...

35:32.047 --> 35:33.923
Single or...

35:36.635 --> 35:37.718
...double?

35:37.844 --> 35:40.387
(Dr Butala) Because your cancer
is triple negative

35:40.514 --> 35:43.057
and looking
at your genetic testing results...

35:44.476 --> 35:47.478
...we advise erring
on the side of caution.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.234
(Dialling tone)

35:53.360 --> 35:55.903
Oh, pick up. Pick up, Jess.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.824
(Mobile vibrating)

35:59.950 --> 36:01.283
Jago!

36:02.160 --> 36:04.411
Jago, get in here, baby!

36:08.583 --> 36:10.459
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

36:12.921 --> 36:17.174
My God. Oh, it worked. It worked.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.553
Oh, we'll just put the kid in a drawer.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.513
We're not living in a Dickens' novel.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.807
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

36:24.933 --> 36:25.933
(Phone vibrating)

36:26.017 --> 36:28.102
- Oh. Hello?
- (Kit) 'Jess.'

36:28.228 --> 36:29.728
Have you seen Mills?

36:29.855 --> 36:33.065
No. She phoned earlier
but she didn't leave a message.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.071
Bloody hell, she was meant
to be back hours ago.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.029
Can I call you back?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.447
- (Kit) 'Yeah.'
- OK.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.786
- Where are you going?
- I think I might know where she is.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.163
She managed to get herself
right in the middle of our big moment.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.833
How does she do that?
It's like telepathy.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.794
I love you. Twenty minutes, tops.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.796
- OK?
- Come here.

37:00.427 --> 37:03.721
Please tell me that you're not gonna
do that for the next nine months.

37:03.847 --> 37:04.847
I might.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.731
Hey!

37:13.857 --> 37:15.524
We're having a baby.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.610
- (Woman) Cheers.
- Yeah.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.165
(Cheering)

37:34.419 --> 37:38.005
(Milly) We need more, please.
Southern cowboys, please.

37:39.466 --> 37:43.344
Oh, it's my best friend
and partner in crime!

37:43.470 --> 37:45.346
- Hi, best friend.
- Hello, sweetheart.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.014
Who are your friends?

37:47.140 --> 37:49.558
This is Ron and Jeremy.
My new drinking buddies.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.684
Nice to meet you.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.186
Ron. Jeremy.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.730
What do you fancy?
A bit of black or a bit of white?

37:56.066 --> 37:57.107
All right.

37:57.233 --> 38:01.445
Back to the bar, now!
Right now!

38:02.447 --> 38:05.115
No, just leave your arse,
so I can play with it.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.035
What the hell is wrong with you?

38:08.161 --> 38:09.828
Kit's worried sick.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.456
- Well, I'm in mourning.
- Who died?

38:12.582 --> 38:13.958
My tits.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.420
It's... it' happening.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.719
(Burps)

38:28.765 --> 38:30.265
I'm sorry.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.770
All right, I'm gonna go to the bar.

38:36.231 --> 38:39.817
To pay the tab, Sister Mary.

38:45.281 --> 38:49.451
Hi, Kit. Yeah.
No, I've got her, everything's fine.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.500
- (American accent) You OK, Milly?
- Ah! You knew my name?

38:56.626 --> 38:59.962
I make a point of learning all the names
of my favourite customers.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.131
And it's on your credit card.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.799
OK.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.096
Can I ask you something?

39:09.222 --> 39:11.098
Yeah. Shoot.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.229
Are these breasts
that you would want to touch?

39:20.608 --> 39:22.609
Yeah. Well, yes.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.656
That means a lot. Thank you.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.199
Any time.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.577
- Any time?
- Yeah, any time.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.955
One whiff of booze
and you act just like your mother.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.834
That is the worst thing
you have ever said to me!

39:42.797 --> 39:45.549
Whoa! Last time
I'm letting you drive my vehicle.

39:46.593 --> 39:50.179
- God, I hate this car.
- Abrupt stop. My gosh!

39:50.305 --> 39:53.432
(Jess) I did it, I got you home.
(Milly) You are a terrible driver.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.142
This is a spaceship.

39:55.268 --> 39:59.063
Oh, Jess, I have always,
always wanted to be wanted.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.773
Always needed to know

40:00.899 --> 40:05.944
that if I turn around on the street,
someone will be looking at my arse.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.655
Well, you know they always are, honey.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.325
Oh my God, I am so vain.
You know that.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.035
I know.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.538
I have spent so much money
and time on me.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.582
And it looks good.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.836
But I'm just, I'm so superficial.
I am, I'm superficial.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.839
And I have a huge...

40:27.342 --> 40:28.842
...ego.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.137
I know.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.186
But, you know,
I'm gonna look like a mutant.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.778
Who's gonna give a shit about me then?

40:49.572 --> 40:50.739
Me.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.157
In you go.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.702
Get that hot arse in there.

40:55.829 --> 40:59.081
(Milly) These cobblestones
are the bane of my existence!

40:59.207 --> 41:02.000
How do those Italian bitches do it?

41:02.127 --> 41:04.336
All right, I miss you already.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.296
(Jess) Miss you already.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.963
All right, my little angels.
Dinner is ready.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.424
- Fish and chips.
- From the chip shop?

41:50.550 --> 41:53.677
No, from the fish shop and the potato shop.

41:53.803 --> 41:54.970
Smells like baked wee.

41:55.096 --> 41:58.891
Uh-huh. Oh, well I'm guessing
you won't want seconds.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.768
- Hello, everyone.
- Oh, hello, Miranda.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.938
Would you like some fish and chips?

42:05.064 --> 42:07.858
- From the chip shop?
- No, they're home-made.

42:07.984 --> 42:10.527
- Boo.
- (Scarlet, Ben and Miranda) Boo!

42:10.653 --> 42:12.696
Thank you, everybody.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.866
Did you go shopping?

42:15.992 --> 42:19.995
One of the lovely costume girls
from the show got me a discount.

42:20.121 --> 42:23.373
It's for Milly. It's a post-op bra.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.169
(Jess) Oh, wow.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.838
It has little cutlets.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.716
(Miranda) Just until they say that she's
healthy enough for reconstruction.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.927
Fingers crossed.

42:37.138 --> 42:40.140
- I think I'm gonna pop upstairs.
- Good idea.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.227
All right, you guys. Come on, let's eat.
Come on, sit down.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.270
- Auntie Jess.
- Hmm? Yes?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.105
Is mum dead?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.024
What?

42:50.860 --> 42:55.948
- Is mum dead?
- Honey, no. She's in the hospital.

42:56.074 --> 42:59.701
When Ella's mum died
she got a scooter and a Nintendo.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.995
You want mum to die
so you can get a Nintendo?

43:02.121 --> 43:05.791
I don't think that's what he was saying.
Actually she's coming home tonight.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.793
- Why would you say that?
- He didn't mean it.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.671
- Don't throw things at him!
- (Scarlet) Why would he say that!

43:10.797 --> 43:12.339
- Please don't fight.
- You bumhead!

43:12.465 --> 43:14.758
- Honey, I want you to sit down...
- You're a bumhead and I hate you!

43:14.884 --> 43:17.052
- First of all, sit down.
- How about I go to the chip shop?

43:17.178 --> 43:18.053
(Ben) Yes!

43:18.179 --> 43:21.181
- (Miranda) OK, I will.
- Great.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.845
The surgeon said it...

44:00.972 --> 44:02.764
...it's a great success.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.044
- Could you...?
- Yeah.

44:49.145 --> 44:50.771
I can't...

44:51.814 --> 44:53.565
You don't have to show me.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.734
I want you to see.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.115
OK.

45:34.107 --> 45:35.607
Jesus.

45:41.447 --> 45:42.948
Well...

45:45.701 --> 45:47.828
Come on, Franken-tits.

45:47.954 --> 45:50.455
Let's get you bandaged up.

46:15.565 --> 46:16.565
Here.

46:21.446 --> 46:24.030
Oh... oh.

46:24.157 --> 46:25.699
What do you need?

46:25.825 --> 46:28.076
The... serum.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.787
- What's that?
- The green bottle.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.540
The expensive-looking one.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.338
Bit more, bit more.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.008
No, no. No, up, upward motion.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.260
What am I, a facialist?

46:46.471 --> 46:49.097
- Oh, maybe I am.
- Don't hit me.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.474
(Jess) Sorry.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.443
(Kit) Cheers, Jess.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.069
Honey.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.698
You're in good hands.

47:06.824 --> 47:10.035
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.705
(Kit) Hello.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.790
How is the patient?

47:15.917 --> 47:18.710
These drugs are so good.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.256
Would you mind holding my handbag?

47:23.382 --> 47:24.758
(Kit) Oh, don't.

47:24.884 --> 47:27.802
God. Stop it.

47:30.556 --> 47:32.057
(Kit) Open wide.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.309
I always wanted to say that to you.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.689
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.280
I think you've got too many teeth.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.868
I think you do.
How many teeth do you have?

48:19.438 --> 48:21.523
(Jago) Jess, you should tell her.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.234
I know, I'm sorry.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.112
I just don't wanna rub it in
that my life is great right now.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.239
She'll resent you more
if you don't tell her.

48:31.450 --> 48:32.534
I'm telling Kit.

48:32.660 --> 48:35.412
- It's my news, too.
- Jay!

48:35.538 --> 48:38.331
Please, let me tell her in my own time.

48:38.457 --> 48:39.457
Fine, I won't.

48:39.542 --> 48:42.085
And I'm not gonna enjoy
this bottle of beer either.

48:42.211 --> 48:45.922
I wish it was a bottle of glue
and it would keep your lips shut.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.924
Oh, that was horrible.

48:48.050 --> 48:50.677
- I hate you right now.
- Yeah, I know you do.

48:50.803 --> 48:53.763
I'm raging with hormones.
I wanna rip your face off.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.473
Why don't you kiss my face off?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.685
- Right, we gotta go. Come on.
- (Jago) Oh, wow.

48:58.811 --> 49:01.396
- Got everything?
- Breast pump. Yes, please.

49:04.317 --> 49:06.067
It doesn't make them bigger.

49:06.193 --> 49:07.235
Oh.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.239
Here, do you want a hand?

49:34.388 --> 49:36.056
Get your shirt off.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.184
That looks good.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.629
Do you wanna say something?

50:10.257 --> 50:11.257
Well...

50:12.468 --> 50:14.177
No, it's not that.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.684
It's nothing...

50:22.812 --> 50:24.688
It's nothing to do with...

50:25.564 --> 50:27.649
Oh, idiot, idiot, idiot.

and he liked things big

I had no knowledge of this party.

I've got some good ones.
I've got some good ones.

55:31.328 --> 55:38.042
This is when they went to Ibiza and you...
well, you both went missing for two weeks.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.378
That was before cell phones.

55:40.504 --> 55:43.423
And this was when you went away
and birthday girl...

55:43.549 --> 55:47.427
That was right after Milly ate
organic mushrooms.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.221
OK! Now that's enough of that.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.140
- Speech!
- No, no, no.

55:52.266 --> 55:54.142
Speech! Let's hear how interesting you are.

55:54.268 --> 55:57.437
- So thank you all for coming tonight.
- (Woman) Free booze!

55:58.772 --> 56:01.649
Firstly, can I just make it clear
that this is not my 40th.

56:01.775 --> 56:05.820
So thank you for the lavish party
but not quite the big 4-0 just yet.

56:05.946 --> 56:07.113
Thank you, Kira.

56:07.239 --> 56:10.074
I know everyone's enjoying

56:12.244 --> 56:15.288
whilst looking at my wig
and looking for tit scars.

56:15.414 --> 56:16.831
No.

56:16.957 --> 56:18.833
Er... and what else? Hm...

56:18.959 --> 56:19.959
Oh, yeah.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.336
I'm not dead yet so let's drink to that!

56:22.463 --> 56:24.547
Not dead!

56:27.217 --> 56:28.718
What?

56:28.844 --> 56:32.889
- What made you think I would want this?
- I don't know what you want.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.224
- No, come on.
- Don't you dare!

56:38.270 --> 56:40.605
(Woman) I hope that's not the end
of the free bar.

56:43.442 --> 56:46.110
(Milly) Don't follow me
like an old Battersea dog.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.280
Excuse me.
You've had enough of that.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.368
What? You spent most of your 20's

56:54.495 --> 56:56.454
face down
in a vat-full of Jack Daniels.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.247
Yeah, then I grew up.

56:59.541 --> 57:01.584
Milly, get back in the party.

57:01.710 --> 57:03.961
- No, it's a shit party!
- I'm enjoying myself.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.714
Oh, well that's good, that's important.
Because it's your night, isn't it?

57:06.840 --> 57:09.050
It's a bit of limelight
for the heroic spouse.

57:09.176 --> 57:10.968
That's why I booked
your favourite restaurant

57:11.095 --> 57:13.805
and paid for your inbred cousins
to come all the way up here!

57:13.931 --> 57:16.291
I'll reimburse you the 47.50 petrol money
for the campervan.

57:16.350 --> 57:20.353
You have no clue how long it took me
to organise people that you care about

57:20.479 --> 57:22.188
to come all the way down here.
No clue!

57:22.314 --> 57:24.107
(Milly) Well done you.

57:24.233 --> 57:27.819
Now you've got your database
for when you arrange my funeral.

57:30.823 --> 57:31.989
(Jess) Wait!

57:33.992 --> 57:36.160
(Jess) Are you OK?
(Milly) No!

57:39.248 --> 57:40.748
(Jago) Fuck, I don't know
how you put up with it.

57:40.874 --> 57:42.792
- Get off!
- Whoa, whoa...

57:45.587 --> 57:47.088
I'm sorry.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.259
I'm sorry.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.346
It's getting too much.

57:58.225 --> 58:01.018
- She's the mother of my kids.
- It's all right.

58:01.145 --> 58:03.563
Come on inside. Come on, Kit.

58:07.359 --> 58:10.027
(Milly) Has he not lived with me
for the last ten years?

58:10.154 --> 58:13.322
I just wanted to spend the evening
with the four of us.

58:13.448 --> 58:16.117
If another person looks at me
with sad eyes and says,

58:16.243 --> 58:17.994
"Oh, you look so well, Milly,"

58:18.120 --> 58:20.538
I am going to projectile vomit!

58:25.335 --> 58:26.752
Was I awful?

58:30.465 --> 58:33.593
No, driver, just go straight. Straight.

58:33.719 --> 58:37.013
- Wait, this isn't the way home.
- We're not going home.

58:37.139 --> 58:39.640
Can you take us here, please?

58:39.766 --> 58:41.058
Hey, mind the...

58:41.185 --> 58:42.393
It's too far.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.896
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

58:45.022 --> 58:49.233
I have a very healthy credit card
and I am a massive tipper.

58:49.359 --> 58:50.401
- OK.
- Whoo!

58:50.527 --> 58:53.946
(Jess) Let me see that.
Let me see your phone.

58:54.072 --> 58:56.157
This is 250 miles away.

58:56.283 --> 58:58.784
You know what?
Sir, you can just drop me off right here.

58:58.911 --> 59:00.271
Driver, do not stop. Keep driving.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.955
Jess, Jess, Jess,
think of it as an adventure.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.999
We'll find a little place
just for the two of us to stay

59:05.125 --> 59:07.168
and we can have crumpets by the fire.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.588
Come on, it's my birthday.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.883
Look, I'll make you a deal.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.468
I will get you some clean clothes.

59:15.594 --> 59:16.594
Some nice clean underwear

59:16.637 --> 59:18.804
because I know how fond you are
of crusty gussets.

59:18.931 --> 59:21.599
Why do you suck me
into this shit?

59:21.725 --> 59:24.006
(Milly) Yeah, turn right here.
There's a little shop here.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.478
(Milly) All right, I'm going in.

59:25.604 --> 59:30.107
Some new knickers coming right up.
I'll be back.

59:30.234 --> 59:33.110
Watch yourself
going across the street, please.

59:37.658 --> 59:39.992
Jay, I know it's mental

59:40.118 --> 59:44.872
but she's always wanted to see the moors.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.336
'God, I've no idea.'

59:50.462 --> 59:52.713
I can't take much more of this.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.715
Well, I'll tell her about the baby.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.759
Well, that makes it all right, then.

59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.638
Jess, you don't have to indulge
her every bonkers whim, you know.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.807
Try saying no to someone with cancer.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:06.143

Do you know how it felt
to be touched again?

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.814
- Don't ask for my approval.
- Oh, I won't.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:57.734
This could blow your family apart.
Or have you not stopped to think about that?

- The fear.
- Oh, don't get all profound on me.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:12.332

but I have this annoying little disease.

you wanted a medal.

I don't wanna be near you.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:34.646
All right, have fun. Off you go,
back to your cosy little houseboat

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:39.192
is bringing in your tiny orange cushions
when it rains.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.788

01:10:57.462 --> 01:11:00.714

You were there
when both my babies were born.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:09.139
You didn't tell me because you think
it's just another thing I might not see, right?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.809
Because I'm never gonna meet that person.
Just say it.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.105
- I wanna go home.
- You wanna go home now?

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:20.651
That's funny because for a minute I thought
you were gonna stay here and live in his attic!

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.946

be my last chance

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.492
- Was.
- No.

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:57.802
- Yeah, I had some problems.
- Oh, sorry. Does Milly know?

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.973
She won't talk to me.

01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:05.435
Everything I do is wrong.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.979
Well, that's just the way she is.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:12.108
Perhaps she's punishing me for not
being the kind of mother she needed.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:16.363
Feel free to contradict me.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.989
I wasn't really there, was I?

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:20.492
Flying around the world, never at home.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:23.036
Two husbands.
Different boyfriends.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.287
Selfish.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.791
- You had an exciting career.
- Yes.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:32.921
I can't have any drama in my life right now,
and Milly is drama.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:39.636
Please, Jess.
Help her to sort everything out.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:43.598
I know she's drama,
but she's our Milly.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.064
So, Doctor B.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.942
Can you give me some nice drugs
for these annoying headaches?

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.568
Milly...

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.907
Don't give me that look.

01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:03.493
I know that look.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:09.374
The results of your MRI
have confirmed our worst fears.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.639
I'm terribly sorry.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.061
How long?

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:34.524
The cancer has spread to my brain.
It's like right behind my eyes.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.953
They can't treat it.

Oh, great.

Why can't they just take the tumour out?

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:15.495
- They'd have to take my brain out.
- Well, your tits, your brain.

radiotherapy or steroids or...

Well thanks for bringing me back
for the good bits.

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:32.971
Come here.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:41.187
But your hair grew back so pretty.

01:21:43.274 --> 01:21:44.941
What is happening with you?

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.653
- Oh, you know, nothing much to say.
- Oh, no, don't you dare be a martyr.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:53.116
You just told me you had brain cancer.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:56.995
Excuse me for not bragging about
my double haemorrhoids. Huge.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:22:00.582
I have the arse of a baboon right now.
It's awful.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:03.376
They gave me a pillow to sit in.
It looks like a...

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:04.752
- Doughnut.
- Yeah.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:05.878
Familiar.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:08.840

Why, what happened?

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:13.136
Well, I was running
through the Yorkshire moors

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.887
and I had a fall.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:18.016
I'm sorry.

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.226
Not allowed any more shocks.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.104

How was the scan today?

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:52.675
'Guess what? Milly showed up.'

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.801
What, on the scan?

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.638
It's spread.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.307
She's so sick.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.351
'Please come home.'

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.145
Hey, sweetheart, it's not long now. OK?

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:07.523
- 'I miss you.'
- I miss you.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:08.775
Show me our bump.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:11.778
'That's our baby in there!'

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:13.863
Oh!

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.323
Jay?

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:18.785
Jay?

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.703
Damn it.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.385
I'm on the naughty step.

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.263
Are you ready to talk?

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:42.141
I'm not a good person.

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.353
I've hurt you and...

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.690
...I have no excuses.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.443
- Do I know him?
- No.

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:55.863
And it's done? It's over with?

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.407
Yeah.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.867
I haven't been able to look you
in the eye since...

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:01.994
Since you couldn't look at me at all.

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.916
- I needed to be looked at.
- I know.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.711
Everything changed.
I didn't know how to love you any more.

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:12.380
God, such an idiot.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:15.341
We've wasted time. Our time.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.009
I don't want to go.

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:19.846
I don't wanna go without you.
I don't wanna go without me being...

01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:23.433
Get upstairs.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.521
Get your knickers off and get upstairs.

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:29.647
Now.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.957
(Milly) Is that a girl or a boy?
I can't tell any more.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.543
(Jess) I know.
(Milly) People are so androgynous.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:53.004
(Jess) Don't draw a moustache on her.
We like her.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.714
(Milly) No, we don't, we hate her.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.217
She's gotta be way older than me.
She looks about 20. Look.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:24:59.927
The little nipple ring.

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:04.474
Jess, is it allowed not to have your age
on your gravestone?

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:11.731
I think you can do whatever you want,
under the circumstances.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:15.526
Although I guess there is that
tragic heroine mileage

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:18.571
you can get out of people
knowing you died so young.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.366
Although not as young as you said you were.

01:25:22.493 --> 01:25:24.619
It's a tough one.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.831
(Milly) I really want there to be a heaven.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.958
Is that pathetic?

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:33.628
Not pathetic.

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:35.922
Hypocritical, maybe.

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:40.551
I really want there to be
a white-clouds-and-all heaven.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.179
Think they'd let me in there?

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:46.891
Not unless they've lowered
the entry requirements.

01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:50.353
I went to see a hospice today.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.981
A hospice? Why?

01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:58.361
For a luxury spa break. Why do you think?

01:25:58.487 --> 01:25:59.862
No.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:03.574
If you go into a hospice,
you'll never come out.

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:07.620
You get used to it, Jess.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.664
I have.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:19.257
When you were born, my darling,
I lay quietly...

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:23.177
- After you'd had your 23 stitches.
- Yeah, after that.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:27.807
I looked at you and I knew I loved you more
than anything else in the world.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.560
More than Ben?

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.814
Well, the same as Ben,
though he didn't actually exist at that point.

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:39.068
I looked at you and I made you a promise.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:42.905
I promised that,
no matter what happened,

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.116
I would always look after you.

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:49.328
But the thing is, my darling...

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:53.541
...I won't always be
here to look after you.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.501
Why not?

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.714
Well, mummy isn't getting better any more.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.216
But I thought that was
what all the chemo was for,

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:04.927
and all the pills.
I thought it was all making you better.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.430
They worked for a while, honey. But...

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.766
...they've stopped making me better.

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:14.770
So, er... you're not going to die, though,
are you?

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:17.481
No!

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:18.900
Who's gonna look after us?

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:21.360
What about when I grow up,
when I need girl things?

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:23.905
- Daddy will be there.
- Oh, great.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:28.451
- Hey, I know about girl things.
- And you'll have Miranda, and Jess too.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.703
You might not die.

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.496
Oh, my darling.

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:36.792
You just have to know my spirit
will always be with you.

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:39.754
What are you talking about?
What does that even mean?

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:56.187
- Did I do it right, Mum?
- That's very good folding, sweetheart.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.991
You can't go to the hospice, you bumhead!

01:28:27.094 --> 01:28:29.136
How are the kids?

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.848
Ben told his teacher to "F" off.

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:36.352
And Milly let Scarlett
have her ears pierced.

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.733
(Milly) Will you help Kit
take the kids to New York for Christmas?

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:44.360
(Miranda) God save me.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:47.363
The ride from the airport is just sad.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:49.073
This is beautiful.

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:52.034
(Miranda) People sit around in cafes
criticising everything.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.412
- (Jess) How are you?
- Well, not thrilled.

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.706
And I can't get any herbal tea here.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:58.541
- Give us five, Mum.
- Sure.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.002
I'm gonna go and get a cuppa.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.879
- See you in a bit.
- Yes.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:09.343
God bless her, Jess, she doesn't shut up.

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.222
Oh, pass me that box.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.390
I have something for you.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.649
I can't help but notice that,
since you've been pregnant,

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:27.278
you've been rather overdosing
on the Birkenstocks.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:31.032
Well, they're comfortable
and completely on trend.

01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:34.285
No, Jess, they're not.
They're revolting.

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.371
So I have these for you.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.127
Oh, my God.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:50.676
Unworn. They're a touch
too showy for this place.

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.227
Wow, you're really going, aren't you?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:03.064
Why else would I be giving you
my best pair of shoes?

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.737
I'm holding on.

01:30:14.493 --> 01:30:15.534
Good.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:19.580
Please don't let the kids forget me.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.459
Tell them all the things we did.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:26.629
You're my expert witness.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:29.298
Even the time you punched out
the police officer

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:30.591
and then threw up in a bin?

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:34.095
Well... edit the student years.

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:36.972
OK.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:40.101
Never stop telling them I loved them.

01:30:46.108 --> 01:30:48.234
All right, put them on.

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:54.281
Oh, yeah.

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:57.243
Oh, yeah. These feel right.

01:30:57.369 --> 01:30:59.703
What are these, a good seven inches?

01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:02.998
- Just what every girl needs.
- That's what she said.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.133
(Jess) Not so bad.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.221
Will you always think of me
when you wear the shoes?

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:20.015
Both times.

01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:26.272
- Jago likes my Birkenstocks, PS.
- You are kidding yourself.

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:37.032
(Groans)

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:39.660
Oh!

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:44.498
(Bleep)

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:46.041
- 'Hello.'
- Jay!

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:48.836
'This is Jago.
I can't come to the phone right now.

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.839
'I'm either sleeping or drilling.'

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:53.174
(Bleep)

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.467
I think the baby's coming early.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:57.887
Come home.
Please come home!

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.054
Oh, God.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:08.981
(Mobile vibrating)

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:22.953
Pick up, pick up.
Pick up.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:25.581
(Mobile continues vibrating)

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.009
- Pick up.
- 'Hello?'

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:38.636
Ah!

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.095
The baby's coming.

01:32:40.222 --> 01:32:41.931
Oh!

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:43.057
Jessie...

01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:44.725
Mills, help.

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:46.518
Oh, no. I'll be there, I'll be there.

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:48.145
Don't panic, I'm coming.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.149
Get my shoes.

01:32:52.275 --> 01:32:55.152
The baby's coming.
I have to go... now.

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:58.614
You can't go. She'll manage.
She's got a midwife.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:02.618
- Don't touch the morphine. Ssh.
- Don't shush me, Kit.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.287
Fine, I'll get a nurse who can shush you.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:19.426
Oh, Mum. I have to be there.

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:24.139
Sod it. I'll get you in the wheelchair.

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.016
OK.

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:30.145
Let me get you up.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.855
OK, up you go. Up.

01:33:31.982 --> 01:33:33.148
Up. OK.

01:33:33.275 --> 01:33:35.317
Take the shoe.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:37.486
Don't worry about the boots,
we'll put them on in the taxi.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.172
- Good. Now got your glasses? OK.
- Yes.

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.615
OK. Your phone?

01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:44.368
OK. We'll take those.

01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:45.953
OK, we're off, baby.

01:33:46.079 --> 01:33:48.664
Just wait here.
Wait here.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.166
Mum?

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.345
Is everything all right, Doctor?

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:07.016
Yes. This patient has acute cephalgia
and requires oxygenation.

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:10.978
Ten long years on a hospital soap,
I knew it would come in handy.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.152
- Give us a bloody hand.
- OK, missus.

01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:21.155
Don't you need an ambulance?

01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:22.823
No, but you will
if you don't get across London

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.158
in under 20 minutes.

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:27.328
Now get a cocking move on.
Let's go. OK, up.

01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:29.204
You've still got it, Mum.

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:38.922
- I want Milly.
- Breathe.

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:41.967
(Announcement) '4-4-5-6. Jago O'Leary.'

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:46.764
'Please call immediately.
I repeat, Jago O'Leary, call 4-4-5-6.'

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.147
(Miranda) Can you speed it up a bit?

01:34:55.273 --> 01:34:57.733
- I'm doing my best, this is London.
- I know, I know.

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:06.408
Get me the bloody morphine.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.286
(Miranda) Do you have satellite navigation
or GPS? What do you have?

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:11.955
I know, I'm being a back-seat driver,
I'm sorry.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:14.708
You turn left here!

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:18.003
- I should've called an Uber.
- Now, now.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:21.799
What the...?
Trying to get some sleep here, mate.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:24.134
I'm trying to watch my wife
have a baby, mate.

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.386
What, now?

01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:27.054
There it is!

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.764
(Miranda) There's the hospital coming up.
(Driver) OK.

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:30.766
(Miranda) How much is it?
(Driver) Have this one on me, love.

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:32.893
I haven't got anything.
I haven't got nothing.

01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:34.186
Me neither.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.063
Oh, come on.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.399
(Miranda) I think this is it.

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:39.858
(Midwife) Well done.

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:40.984
Oh, my God, Jess!

01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:42.444
(Midwife) Take a breather.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:52.329
You can have that baby now.

01:35:53.873 --> 01:35:55.916
- Glad you're here.
- Me, too.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:36:00.170
How could you not tell me
this was this painful?

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.005
Where's your badge?

01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:04.216
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:07.428
Oh, it's a long story. I'm her mother.

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:12.099
- How did you do this twice?
- I don't know.

01:36:12.225 --> 01:36:14.977
- It won't connect.
- Try the router up on the bed.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.103
Right, OK, come on.

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:18.230
Stop rubbing my shoulders.

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:20.858
I need a knife.
I just wanna cut the baby out.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:23.318
- She's usually very sweet.
- No, I'm not!

01:36:23.445 --> 01:36:26.864
I'm an evil bitch
and that's why God is hurting me like this.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.990
I can't do it.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:32.202
- Jess, sweetie. Sweetie. Look at me.
- I can't do it. I thought I could, I can't.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:35.581
I know right now it feels like
you're shitting out a pineapple.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:36.874
- Yeah.
- I know that.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.127
But trust me, this is the best thing
you will ever do. So keep pushing.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.297
Keep pushing, I know you can do it.

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.884
OK. OK.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:49.553
(Midwife) Good.

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:55.142
- You got anything, Jago? Nothing?
- That's it.

01:36:55.268 --> 01:36:56.602
- (Bleeping)
- Yeah, got it, got it, got it.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.648
- Keep going. Keep going.
- That's it. That's it.

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.522
(Mobile ringing)

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.151
It's Jago.

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:06.195
- How do I use it?
- (Milly) Answer.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:10.324
- Miranda?
- 'Oh! Jago. Hi.'

01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:13.577
- Your wife's a bit of a cougar, man.
- That's not my wife, mate.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.329
Miranda, put the camera on Jess.

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:17.080
Yes, yes, I will.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.667
You evil bastard.

01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:22.794
'How can you not be here right now?'

01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:26.131
I know, baby. I'm so sorry.
I wish I was there, I really do.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:29.343
- 'I really wanna be with you.'
- She's nearly there.

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:30.302
OK.

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.054
Miranda, put the camera
down the business end.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.681
- 'I wanna see my baby being born.'
- Are you sure?

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:36.433
'Yeah. Do it. Do it. Do it.'

01:37:36.559 --> 01:37:38.435
I guess I've done worse films.

01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:39.561
(Midwife) Come on, Jess.

01:37:39.646 --> 01:37:41.563
That's it. That's all right.
Yeah, that's it.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:43.398
Baby's coming.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:44.399
Here we go.

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:46.151
Go on, baby, that's it.

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:49.279
- You can do it, you're almost there.
- OK. OK.

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:52.449
- Hey, push, push! Push! Push!
- (All) Push! Push!

01:37:52.575 --> 01:37:54.117
Keep going.

01:37:54.244 --> 01:37:56.828
- That's it, Jess. Go on, baby. I love you.
- (All) Push! Push!

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:01.625
I can see the head.

01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:04.002
Yeah, yeah!

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:06.713
Oh, it's coming. It's coming.

01:38:09.634 --> 01:38:12.094
- (Man) It's a baby!
- (All cheer)

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.929
I love you, Jess.

01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:16.431
Hey... hey...

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.358
What is it? Is it a boy or a girl?
What is it?

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.769
'It's a beautiful baby...'

01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:24.439
Shit!

01:38:30.989 --> 01:38:33.156
(Midwife) Can you get me the towel, please?

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:05.063
Let me take a picture for the father.

01:39:06.065 --> 01:39:07.899
Smile for daddy.

01:39:10.737 --> 01:39:12.154
Lovely.

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:26.251
- Hey.
- Ssh.

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:32.799
Oh, wow.

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:40.766
- He's amazing.
- Isn't he beautiful?

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.893
Look at him.

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:54.237
(Milly wheezing)

01:39:58.117 --> 01:40:00.744
(Kit) 'I'm reading this book
at the moment called...'

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.580
(Kit giggles)

01:40:03.706 --> 01:40:07.709
(Milly) 'Where did you get that book?
I can't believe...'

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:15.133
'I'm laughing so much it's making me cry.
Going to the other side...'

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:19.763
(Ben and Scarlett) 'Mumsy, like this.
Mumsy, like this.'

01:40:20.682 --> 01:40:22.724
(Ben) Why do I have to eat a pea?

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:24.559
(Kit) 'A pea. He ate a pea.'

01:40:24.686 --> 01:40:26.228
(Milly) 'I can't tell
if you're good or bad.'

01:40:26.354 --> 01:40:29.981
(Miranda) 'Let's do this the English way.
Cup of tea.'

01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:34.486
(Jess) 'Think he just insinuated
that you don't need to lose any weight.'
