00:47.005 --> 00:49.048
This will look good in your office.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.845
What, take that thing on the train,
like some kid who won at the 4-H?

00:55.222 --> 00:59.100
Besides, no one wants to look
like they care about awards.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.018
But you do.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.189
Isn't that sad?

01:06.483 --> 01:08.776
Roger was very eloquent.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.115
He likes to be recognized for selling .

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Creative is less important.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.954
Creative helps sell.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.873
But he gave the speech.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.043
Look at you in this tuxedo.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.964
Say it for me.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.633
Pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Draper.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.177
Enchanted .

02:21.266 --> 02:22.266
Hey.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.102
It's 8:00.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.106
Shit.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.320
Oh, my Lord .

02:37.115 --> 02:40.576
Mommy, Mommy!
Ethel's downstairs.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.286
She's making us breakfast.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.038
Sally, Mommy has a headache.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.457
What's that thing?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.042
Daddy's boss won an award .

02:48.126 --> 02:50.044
Daddy won one, too.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.879
An award for good horses?

02:51.964 --> 02:55.132
Go downstairs and eat something .

02:59.721 --> 03:01.138
I think there's Alka-Seltzer in the kitchen .

03:04.560 --> 03:05.560
Are you okay?

03:05.644 --> 03:07.103
Yeah, just do it in the kitchen .

03:07.187 --> 03:09.313
I don't want to hear the bubbles.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.620
Congratulations, Mr. Draper.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.788
Thank you .

03:25.873 --> 03:28.082
I hear Advertising Age ran a picture.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.167
Fortunately, no one reads that.

03:33.171 --> 03:36.299
That's really amazing .

03:36.383 --> 03:38.259
I'll get Mr. Campbell and Mr. Kinsey.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.053
They wanted you to know
they were waiting, but they left.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.305
That's rude.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.643
They said something about
the Newkie Award going to your head .

03:47.728 --> 03:49.103
Congratulations, by the way.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.438
Thank you .

03:50.522 --> 03:51.856
Congratulations to you , too.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.024
Thank you , Peggy.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.110
Congratulations for what, being the only one
on time for this meeting?

03:56.194 --> 03:59.113
Oh, I was just telling Peggy
I got a short story published .

03:59.197 --> 04:00.948
Good for you .

04:01.033 --> 04:03.284
The Atlantic Monthly.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.119
Look at that.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.495
Congratulations.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.914
Thank you .

04:07.998 --> 04:09.874
What does that have to do with you , Kenny?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.127
"Tapping a Maple
on a Cold Vermont Morning ."

04:13.211 --> 04:17.006
Cosgrove here got a story published
inThe,uh... The Atlantic Monthly.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.634
- Heavy.
- You're kidding .

04:19.718 --> 04:21.510
I look forward to reading it.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.970
Keep it. I've got copies.

04:23.055 --> 04:27.058
Congrats, indeed . A thing like that.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.144
You're a writer. You write.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.354
Well, yes.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.774
The weird thing is
short fiction is not my strong suit.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.067
I have two novels.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.319
Novels? About what?

04:38.403 --> 04:41.238
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

04:41.323 --> 04:44.659
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.410
The other one is, well ,

04:46.495 --> 04:48.162
a woman who's a widow--

04:48.246 --> 04:50.581
she kind of got stuck
with this family farm .

04:50.666 --> 04:52.208
No one will help her except this boy.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.336
Those don't even sound stupid .

04:55.420 --> 04:56.420
Thanks.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.714
I mean , they both sound good .

04:58.799 --> 05:01.258
- Want to read one?
- I do.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.971
But I also want to talk
about Liberty Capital Savings.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.973
Right.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.184
Talk, one of you .

05:10.268 --> 05:13.187
As you know, Jack Konig says
they want a new promotion .

05:13.271 --> 05:14.814
Interest rates are level .

05:14.898 --> 05:18.442
Some kind of irresistible fireworks
that bring people to the bank,

05:18.527 --> 05:19.652
even if it's just to visit.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.154
I hate it when they say fireworks.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.698
Especially when they keep
talking about a toaster

05:23.782 --> 05:26.367
with a warming tray on top, or a blender.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.785
A blender's nice.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.038
Jack keeps talking
about escalating the toaster wars

05:31.123 --> 05:32.289
in order to lure women in ,

05:32.374 --> 05:34.583
which is silly when you think about it,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.210
because other than a few working girls,

05:36.294 --> 05:38.421
most women aren't
in charge of the banking .

05:38.505 --> 05:39.505
Not in my house.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.631
They visit the bank.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.092
They do.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.846
All we do is try to get the girls in .

05:46.930 --> 05:49.932
Families.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.851
But you know what?

05:53.478 --> 05:57.815
Men need their own accounts,
beyond the family.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.066
Men?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.151
Oh , I can see that.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.820
Discretion . Discretionary.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.156
Statements sent to the office.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.741
Yes.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.327
Liberty Capital Private Account.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.330
No.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.335
Executive Account.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.339
That's why he won an award .

06:23.759 --> 06:25.092
Accounts won the award .

06:25.177 --> 06:26.177
Yeah .

06:31.349 --> 06:33.601
There's a call for you
from Bix Beiderbecke.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.523
Hello, Mr. Beiderbecke?

06:39.608 --> 06:43.360
It's me, and don't ask who,
or you'll spoil the mood .

06:47.282 --> 06:48.365
Who's Bix?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.367
The trumpeter.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.287
I was thinking
about playing the horn this afternoon .

06:53.371 --> 06:55.456
Where are you calling me from?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.708
I just had a phone put in .

07:00.837 --> 07:03.297
Really. Instant connection,

07:03.381 --> 07:07.384
just like that night
at the ticket booth in Grand Central.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.220
Midge, I'm at work.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.304
Just get down here.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.932
I want you to pull my hair
and ravish me

07:13.016 --> 07:14.850
and leave me for dead.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.578
I'll be back after lunch .

07:38.458 --> 07:40.751
Kenneth Cosgrove.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.212
I think I'm going to vomit.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.756
Who the hell is Ken Cosgrove?

07:45.841 --> 07:46.924
He's from Burlington, Vermont.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.592
His father is a salesman .

07:48.677 --> 07:49.927
What does that have to do with it?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.178
I can't believe he got published

07:51.263 --> 07:52.930
and didn't tell anyone until it came out.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.267
No, he kept walking around
like the idiot he is.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.605
I have this story
about this crazy night I had

08:01.690 --> 08:04.984
where I ended up in Jersey City
with all these Negroes,

08:05.068 --> 08:07.111
and we all got along .

08:07.195 --> 08:09.905
Can you imagine how good that story is?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.282
No.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.243
It is.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.370
It's a national magazine.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.997
Yep.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.457
That hurts, too.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.384
That was it.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.386
That's what I called for.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.013
You can go.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.394
You can't call me at work.

08:40.478 --> 08:44.398
You scared of me
getting lonely all the time?

08:44.482 --> 08:47.318
Start having conversations with you

08:47.402 --> 08:49.361
and ring you all the time,

08:49.446 --> 08:51.488
saying, "When are you gonna come over?"

08:56.536 --> 08:58.579
This is working right now.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.166
And it worked today.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.504
Look, I'm sorry your life
is in a million pieces.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.508
Be easier for you to have one less.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.845
I hurt your feelings.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.936
You didn't like my call a little bit?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.812
I'm here.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.191
And you waited until you were done

09:27.275 --> 09:29.526
to make me feel bad
about the phone call .

09:36.034 --> 09:41.038
I like that you come in here,
acting like somebody else.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.543
It must be so intense above 1 4th Street.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.422
Then you shoot down on the train .

09:52.550 --> 09:56.095
That look when I open that door.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.598
Sometimes you're preoccupied ,

09:59.683 --> 10:02.559
but then you always. . .

10:02.644 --> 10:05.479
well, you always. . .

10:05.563 --> 10:07.564
change gears.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.862
I don't even think about it.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.573
I know.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.162
I like being your medicine.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.417
Okay.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.968
What's wrong with it?

10:36.052 --> 10:37.928
Just tell me. I can tell you don't like it.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.513
Oh , I do.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.392
And I love that you're
sitting alone at your typewriter,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.020
drinking a Scotch , thinking it up.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.730
But you don't like it.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.151
I mostly read the classics.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.779
It seemed strange to me.
It's too modern .

10:57.032 --> 10:59.408
Really?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.286
Uh, that's kind of a compliment.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.205
But I don't think you mean it that way.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.624
I just think it's odd that the bear is talking .

11:11.004 --> 11:14.465
The bear is not talking .

11:14.549 --> 11:18.594
It's what the hunter imagines
the bear to be thinking .

11:20.638 --> 11:23.724
Well, it's well-written .

11:23.808 --> 11:25.851
Why don't you submit it?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.313
I was going to when I
finished dickering with it.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.357
You could run it by Charlie Fiddich .

11:31.441 --> 11:35.569
He has one of those big
publishing jobs, doesn't he?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.572
Your friend Laura kept saying
how he makes things happen there.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.740
Why would I do that?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.325
Because he can help us.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.577
Call him . Ask him to look at the story.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.787
Why now?

11:45.872 --> 11:48.582
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?

11:48.666 --> 11:51.460
He's an account executive, just like me.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.587
Did you know that?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.798
My father reads the damn Atlantic.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.965
So what?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.176
You don't want to be a writer.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.511
I thought it was a hobby.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.680
He's out there,
People know who he is.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.101
Pumpkin , Charlie Fiddich?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.978
I'm surprised .

12:11.272 --> 12:14.024
You can tell what this means to me.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.614
You said you'd do anything for me.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.908
I don't understand you .

12:22.992 --> 12:24.827
You were so upset when I told you .

12:24.911 --> 12:26.453
Told me about what?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.621
Peter.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.706
Told me about what?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.795
That he was my first.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.007
Well . . .

12:41.886 --> 12:46.306
this helps make up for that.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.648
Let Charlie Fiddich . . .

12:54.732 --> 12:57.734
see what he's been missing .

13:00.488 --> 13:01.738
Okay.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.082
- Good morning .
- Oh , good morning .

13:12.167 --> 13:15.002
Traffic meeting is starting
in the conference room .

13:18.923 --> 13:20.466
Really.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.633
Cosgrove, I'm serious.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.885
I think it shows tremendous fortitude,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.678
and I'd like to see more of it around here:

13:24.762 --> 13:26.638
people finishing things.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.600
I guarantee you that in the bottom drawer
of every desk in this place

13:29.684 --> 13:32.060
- is the first ten pages of a novel ,
- Five.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.855
The story itself was not much to my liking ,

13:34.939 --> 13:38.150
but I think it showed
an uncanny understanding

13:38.234 --> 13:40.027
of what most people like.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.487
I guess so.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.363
What did you get paid
for that, a hundred bucks?

13:43.448 --> 13:44.573
About that.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.241
Well , that'll keep you working here.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.703
So, Miss Holloway,

13:49.787 --> 13:51.330
would you like to take the reins?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.707
Let's start with Maytag . Mr. Cosgrove.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.626
Do you want to complain
about the copy,

13:55.710 --> 13:58.253
now that you're a big writer?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.088
Production needs 50% up front,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.590
and we're waiting on a check.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.301
And when will you be calling
the client about that?

14:04.385 --> 14:05.677
Well , I spoke with him last week,

14:05.762 --> 14:08.722
and I'll check with him
again this afternoon .

14:08.806 --> 14:10.015
Aren't you good?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.059
Rio de Janeiro.

14:12.143 --> 14:15.270
The double-page spread
we ran in Life and Town & Country

14:15.355 --> 14:16.396
was so successful ,

14:16.481 --> 14:18.732
they want to resize the ad
to run in Reader's Digest.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.942
Big ad .

14:20.026 --> 14:21.276
Little magazine.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.486
Sal's problem .

14:22.570 --> 14:24.071
Lucky Strike?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.197
Don?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.492
Sales are great. Lawsuit is pending .

14:28.576 --> 14:30.244
You're the one who's
supposed to keep an eye out

14:30.328 --> 14:31.328
on what's happening in Washington .

14:31.412 --> 14:32.829
After the election .

14:35.291 --> 14:38.460
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.629
I'll take any excuse
to get out of this meeting .

14:41.839 --> 14:43.465
His name is Adam Whitman .

14:51.015 --> 14:52.015
Tell him , uh--

14:52.100 --> 14:53.100
Where is he?

14:53.184 --> 14:54.601
Reception .

14:56.563 --> 14:59.648
I should , uh . . . I have to deal with this.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.857
Sure, sure.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.526
You better come back, now.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.194
- I got this.
- Okay.

15:13.246 --> 15:22.254
Can I help you?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.881
It's you .

15:26.593 --> 15:28.510
It's really you .

15:28.595 --> 15:30.220
Dick.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.681
I can't believe it.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.143
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.895
I know I'm grown up, but, Dick, it's me.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.857
It's Adam .

15:43.443 --> 15:45.193
Your little brother?

15:46.738 --> 15:47.904
It's Don .

15:50.199 --> 15:53.452
It says Donald Draper,
but I knew it was you .

15:57.749 --> 16:00.667
Are you upset? Are you mad at me?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.794
I don't even know who you are.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.838
I know I look different.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.799
I grew up tall, okay?

16:07.884 --> 16:09.551
But it's me, Dick.

16:09.677 --> 16:14.681
Look, I'm a janitor at American Calculator
in the Empire State Building ,

16:14.766 --> 16:16.475
and I found this is someone's trash .

16:16.559 --> 16:17.851
I thought I saw a ghost.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.647
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.192
You can't even look at me.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.863
Okay. You're at work.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.823
I can come back another time.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.868
No.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.873
There's a coffee shop
three blocks west of here.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.125
Deelite.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.877
I'll meet you there at noon .

16:43.961 --> 16:45.003
That's swell.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.763
And everything's all set
for the Liberty Capital meeting?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.894
Yes, of course, all set.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.938
Well , thank you all.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.774
I'm glad everybody can make it sound
like they're working so hard .

18:22.018 --> 18:24.227
I can't believe this.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.396
It is really you .

18:36.199 --> 18:37.824
What do you want from me?

18:37.909 --> 18:40.744
I don't understand this.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.163
You have nothing to say to me?

18:43.247 --> 18:46.166
Nothing to ask me?

18:46.250 --> 18:51.171
Dick, I thought you were dead ,
and you're right here.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.716
That's not me.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.678
Can't you even say my name?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.098
Adam . . .

19:04.101 --> 19:06.019
that's not me.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.687
It is.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.732
What happened to you?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.654
Why did you do that?

19:15.738 --> 19:17.823
Why did you leave me?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.827
I couldn't go back there.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.123
Nothing for me.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.628
I knew you weren't dead .

19:31.712 --> 19:36.049
I knew I saw you that day
hiding in the window in your uniform .

19:36.133 --> 19:38.343
I was only 8, but I knew it was you .

19:39.428 --> 19:41.388
It was a long time ago.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.472
I can't believe--

19:42.557 --> 19:44.057
When I saw that picture in the paper,

19:44.141 --> 19:48.728
I thought, "It looks exactly like him ,
except around the eyes."

19:48.813 --> 19:51.356
Donald Draper?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.067
What kind of name is that?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.277
What difference does it make?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.112
People change their names.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.364
Yeah, I guess.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.870
What happened to her?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.246
Mom?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.540
She wasn't my mother.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.959
She never let me forget that.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.878
She's gone.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.172
Stomach cancer.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
Good .

20:18.968 --> 20:20.635
U ncle Mack took it pretty hard .

20:20.720 --> 20:23.013
He passed , too.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.766
Are you sure you don't want anything?

20:29.270 --> 20:32.647
I know. I've got this lump in my throat.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.233
I'd love to eat right now, but I can't.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.951
Did you miss me at all?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.917
Of course I did .

20:53.252 --> 20:54.669
It's good to see you .

20:54.754 --> 20:56.129
You look well .

20:56.213 --> 20:58.214
Would have rather had lunch with you .

20:58.299 --> 21:00.258
I know. But I have an appointment

21:00.343 --> 21:02.469
with the decorator
for our new apartment.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.221
Another time, I promise.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.400
You said you enjoyed the story.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.153
Yes, I did .

21:20.237 --> 21:23.031
As much as anyone can
enjoy that kind of thing .

21:23.115 --> 21:25.533
So you like it, or you didn't like it?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.953
It doesn't matter.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.746
It matters that I publish it, right?

21:29.830 --> 21:32.582
Yes. It does.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.169
Have you been seeing Laura still?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.046
Yes.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.130
She's terrific.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.215
Fun .

21:40.299 --> 21:42.175
She really is.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.437
Trudy, I want to talk to you

21:54.522 --> 21:57.023
about something that has
nothing to do with this.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.609
Okay.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.278
I miss you .

22:03.781 --> 22:07.325
I miss being with you .

22:09.203 --> 22:11.204
That's very sweet to hear.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.666
I know you're married .

22:14.750 --> 22:18.294
It doesn't have to be more
than just being with you .

22:20.881 --> 22:23.258
I can't.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.301
Charlie, I--

22:27.346 --> 22:30.598
No. I can't. I'm a newlywed .

22:33.310 --> 22:36.771
Maybe. . .like in some movie,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.398
sometime in the future, when we're old .

22:38.482 --> 22:39.607
Maybe then.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.235
I want you now. I don't want you old .

22:42.319 --> 22:43.778
I want you now.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.866
I know you'll never leave him .

22:50.327 --> 22:52.537
I can keep a secret.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.209
No, Charlie.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.128
Please.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.382
Sally, don't run .

23:04.467 --> 23:05.884
Okay!

23:05.968 --> 23:08.428
Hello.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.764
My goodness,
you're Mrs. Draper, aren't you?

23:10.848 --> 23:12.724
Hello. You must be Peggy.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.225
I recognized your voice.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.020
So nice to finally meet you in person .

23:18.105 --> 23:20.523
This is Sally and Robert.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.358
We're here for our portrait.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.818
Of course.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.904
I guess I knew that.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.283
Is he in there?

23:30.367 --> 23:34.245
U m , not right now, but please go inside.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.375
I'll be right back.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.278
Joan?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.115
Oh, my God , Joan , I need your help.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.199
Let go of me.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.325
Mrs. Draper is here,

24:12.409 --> 24:14.119
and they're having their portrait taken ,

24:14.203 --> 24:16.329
and he snuck out,
and I don't know who to lie to.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.040
Calm down . Just breathe slowly.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.333
Mr. Draper is out,

24:20.417 --> 24:22.752
and I don't think I'm supposed
to know where he went.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.629
- That happens,
- But they're taking their pictures today,

24:24.713 --> 24:26.089
and I would have reminded him ,

24:26.173 --> 24:27.715
but he slipped out before I could .

24:27.800 --> 24:30.051
It's his fault. He comes and goes
and never says anything .

24:30.136 --> 24:31.177
Where is he?

24:31.262 --> 24:33.471
I make an excuse to Mrs. Draper,
she could catch him in it,

24:33.556 --> 24:35.265
especially if she just leaves.

24:35.349 --> 24:36.349
Or even worse, then he'll know

24:36.433 --> 24:38.560
that I know where he was.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.727
Where is he?

24:41.564 --> 24:42.814
I don't know.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.190
You do know,

24:44.275 --> 24:46.609
and you're going to tell me,

24:46.694 --> 24:49.362
or I'm not going to tell you what to do.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.573
- I can't believe you .
- Well?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.369
He sees this woman .

24:56.453 --> 24:58.163
He saw her the other day.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.123
He came back all greasy and calm .

25:00.207 --> 25:01.624
No.

25:01.709 --> 25:02.792
Oh , God . Now I've told you .

25:02.877 --> 25:04.794
I'm the worst secretary in the world .

25:04.879 --> 25:06.963
- Who is she?
- I don't care. Please hurry.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.678
Peggy, use your noodle.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.346
You're making this so complicated .

25:15.431 --> 25:17.640
You go out there,
and you entertain her and her brats.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.058
Get some Hershey bars from the cart

25:19.143 --> 25:22.645
and tell her you don't know where he is
and you forgot to remind him .

25:22.730 --> 25:25.356
It is the truth , And when he comes back,
let him have an excuse.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.983
He'll have one.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.401
And then you just start apologizing

25:28.485 --> 25:30.278
for, well . . .

25:30.362 --> 25:32.447
just how stupid you are.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.492
It's probably what I would have done anyway.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.787
Oh , God , now I really shouldn't have told you .

25:39.872 --> 25:41.456
You shouldn't have told me.

25:42.583 --> 25:43.833
I'm not gonna tell anybody,

25:43.918 --> 25:46.461
but you shouldn't have told anybody that.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.803
This isn't how I imagined it.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.223
I'm sorry.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.807
You keep saying you're sorry.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.269
Where were you all this time?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.940
Around . Here, mostly.

26:08.359 --> 26:09.692
I'm not mad at you .

26:09.777 --> 26:11.527
I just want to know.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.323
I mean , look at you .

26:16.533 --> 26:19.369
Who is Donald Draper?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.915
I mean , do you have a wife?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.750
Kids?

26:28.963 --> 26:30.463
I'm going to go.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.468
That's it?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.054
Want me to pay for lunch?

26:38.138 --> 26:39.430
- No,
- Let me.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.640
You didn't have anything .

26:40.724 --> 26:43.142
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.477
When I was little,

26:44.561 --> 26:46.896
I used to imagine this day happening,
and here it is.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.232
I don't understand . I'm family.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.193
I just want to be a part of your life.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.738
Adam, that's not going to happen .

26:57.157 --> 26:58.491
I'm going to walk out that door.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.493
That's it.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.454
I'm not buying your lunch . . .

27:03.539 --> 27:05.665
because this never happened .

27:16.218 --> 27:18.803
I don't like black licorice, either.

27:20.431 --> 27:21.764
Are you sure we should wait?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.016
I think so.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.685
I can't believe I forgot.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.353
Oh , are you missing your lunch?

27:27.438 --> 27:30.148
No. It's okay. I brought it.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.275
Well, you'll probably
be going out tonight.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.526
Might as well take it easy.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.736
That's true.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.827
Do you have a boyfriend or a steady?

27:42.911 --> 27:45.204
Um , no.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.248
I work a lot.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.791
Some blind dates.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.294
I remember those.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.962
- The disappointments.
- Yeah .

27:58.802 --> 27:59.844
M r. Draper's office.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.387
How's it going?

28:02.639 --> 28:04.932
No, thank you . I'm staying in .

28:09.730 --> 28:11.814
- Mr. Draper treating you well?
- Yes.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.691
He's been very patient

28:13.776 --> 28:16.819
while I've been learning
the ropes around here.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.864
Don't you just hate it
when his mouth runs on and on?

28:19.948 --> 28:21.949
Excuse me?

28:22.034 --> 28:25.078
I'm joking .

28:25.162 --> 28:27.455
You probably know more
about him than I do.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.712
You look so beautiful in that light.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.464
You should take
the picture right there.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.219
Well, I-- I did want to look good .

28:43.722 --> 28:45.431
Mr. Draper. I'm--

28:47.059 --> 28:48.643
The portrait.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.145
What happened? Where were you?

28:51.230 --> 28:52.730
We were just about to leave.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.066
I'm so embarrassed ,
I forgot to remind you .

28:55.150 --> 28:58.277
No, I forgot to check in
before I went to the printer.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.613
I'm such a fool ,
I don't know where my head is.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.697
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.616
- Please forgive me,
- No, it's nothing.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.244
All we need are some wet paper towels
to get the chocolate off

29:06.328 --> 29:07.620
before we go in front of the lens.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.205
We'll have to do that on the way.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.832
They must be waiting
for us at the studio.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.625
Come on .

29:12.709 --> 29:13.709
Nice to meet you .

29:17.714 --> 29:19.215
Don't worry about it.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.550
Thank you .

29:27.641 --> 29:28.641
They're terrible.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.560
No, they're not.

29:30.644 --> 29:31.644
Don was late.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.020
It ruins the whole thing .

29:33.105 --> 29:34.897
Oh , Carlton's always late.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.693
You can see what's important to them .

29:38.777 --> 29:42.655
We're very important to them . Stop it.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.658
How'd you like to be
in Helen Bishop's family portrait?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.743
There's a big hole there, believe me.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.333
I want to take them again anyway.

29:54.418 --> 29:57.128
Sally looks fat.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.672
I don't think so.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.716
The worst part is,
Don will think they're fine.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.676
Here. Maybe this one.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.011
Blow that one up.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.263
It'll hold you until the Christmas card .

30:07.347 --> 30:09.682
The color is off on these, too.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.017
Am I wrong?

30:12.686 --> 30:15.688
I really expect the royal treatment
when I go to Don's office,

30:15.772 --> 30:18.733
and I seldom get it.

30:18.817 --> 30:24.322
It's like walking into another country
where I don't speak the language.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.699
At Carlton's, I feel like I'm stupid .

30:26.783 --> 30:29.410
All that Manhattan talk.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.500
Our husbands.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.169
They are better out here, aren't they?

30:38.253 --> 30:40.546
Infinitely.

30:40.631 --> 30:44.091
We took your idea of product
and applied it directly to the bank.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.761
Banking products,
not household products.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.055
You said banking products
weren't sexy.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.723
We went down
some really dumb roads,

30:50.807 --> 30:52.725
like bank accounts for children,

30:52.809 --> 30:54.727
and then Don, here,

30:54.811 --> 30:57.563
had this Roman candle of an idea.

30:57.648 --> 30:58.731
Don?

30:59.816 --> 31:02.318
I think Paul has a handle on this.

31:09.451 --> 31:14.121
The modern executive is a busy man .

31:14.206 --> 31:16.958
He leads a complicated life.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.794
He has business expenses, family, leisure.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.755
How are you supposed
to keep all that straight?

31:22.839 --> 31:26.759
Well, now Liberty Capital
is going to help you with that.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.053
Okay.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.596
What is this?

31:30.681 --> 31:34.850
An account for a man that is private.

31:34.935 --> 31:38.646
The statements come to the office,
not your home.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.691
I see. For organizing your life.

31:41.775 --> 31:42.775
If it needs it.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.402
Liberty for the libertine.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.279
That's good .

31:46.363 --> 31:47.989
Does this say that to you?

31:48.115 --> 31:50.783
It will if you put the word "private" in there
instead of "liberty."

31:50.867 --> 31:53.869
Executive Private Account.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.790
What are you laughing at?

31:57.874 --> 32:01.127
A portion of our customers
are already, I believe, doing this.

32:01.211 --> 32:02.795
There's just no name for it,

32:02.879 --> 32:05.548
and we had no way to charge them .

32:05.632 --> 32:06.799
I like the torch .

32:06.883 --> 32:08.843
It says, don't get burned .

32:08.927 --> 32:10.803
It could start some uncomfortable
conversations

32:10.887 --> 32:13.806
in a lot of homes, but, uh--

32:13.890 --> 32:15.808
it's better than a calendar.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.893
Let's talk placement.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.938
Hello.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.899
I opened everything but that one.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.557
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

32:56.642 --> 33:00.478
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.854
The other is about--

33:01.938 --> 33:04.023
You know, I just finished reading it.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.859
It's really a great story.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.945
Thank you . That means a lot.

33:10.030 --> 33:14.784
It's nice to see
someone's passion be rewarded .

33:14.868 --> 33:15.868
You know what?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.204
I don't have a copy of it,

33:18.288 --> 33:24.543
and I wanted to give it to my girlfriend .

33:24.628 --> 33:26.462
Hey!

33:26.546 --> 33:29.882
You said you got, like,
50 more copies, right?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.342
Maybe I do.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.886
If not, it's on every newsstand in town .

33:33.970 --> 33:36.222
Good to hear.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.903
You're leaving?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.905
Yes. For the day.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.782
Oh , okay.

33:54.866 --> 33:55.908
I'm going home.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.327
You can reach me there if necessary.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.127
I've always wondered
why he's ignored me.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.878
Probably because he's so good-looking

34:07.963 --> 34:10.005
he can go outside the office
for whatever he wants.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.133
Most of these fellas can't.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.553
He seemed different to me.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.930
Well, either way,
you have to do your job.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.349
Keep his record clean here and at home.

34:20.434 --> 34:24.103
Honestly, if he sees that in you ,
you are solid gold .

34:24.187 --> 34:26.230
That's my job?

34:26.314 --> 34:27.606
Yes.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.900
That's his private life.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.944
Private.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.904
That's how these men are.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.656
And it's why we love them .

34:35.741 --> 34:36.949
I don't love him .

34:37.033 --> 34:38.117
Fine.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.786
Look, if you're even thinking
about passing judgment,

34:40.871 --> 34:41.954
then you're in the wrong business.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.331
Okay.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.458
You need to relax.

34:45.542 --> 34:46.959
I have never come over here

34:47.043 --> 34:50.880
and not seen you with a look on your face
that said "I need a drink."

34:53.049 --> 34:54.800
This job is odd .

34:54.885 --> 34:57.052
But it's the best.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.139
Listen , Kenny.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.557
What?

35:01.641 --> 35:03.517
Listen , I know I've been a bear,

35:03.602 --> 35:08.939
but I've been competing neck and neck
with people in this place.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.066
I didn't know I was
competing with you , too.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.071
You lost.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.417
Hello, sweetheart.

35:28.502 --> 35:30.377
Hello, dear.

35:41.973 --> 35:46.644
Well . . . I have some good news.

35:47.938 --> 35:50.481
Charlie Fiddich
came by the house this afternoon .

35:50.565 --> 35:52.441
Did he? Here?

35:52.526 --> 35:54.944
I guess your lunch did go well .

35:55.028 --> 35:58.155
It wasn't lunch . I told you that.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.284
So what did he say? Don't tease me.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.453
He said he was going
to get you published .

36:04.538 --> 36:06.580
That is incredibly swell news.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.706
When? Where?

36:07.791 --> 36:09.959
Boys' Life magazine.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.085
What?

36:11.169 --> 36:12.753
It's a $40 fee,

36:12.838 --> 36:15.047
and a lot of people read it.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.050
Are you kidding me? Boys' Life?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.971
That story was good enough
for The New Yorker.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.808
And don't act like those magazines
do everything on merit.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.477
I thought you'd be happy.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.688
For a year's work.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.443
You don't want me to have what I want.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.738
You're going to be published .

36:39.823 --> 36:42.658
Boys' Life.

36:42.742 --> 36:47.746
Probably next to some ad for exploding cigars.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.085
I could have gotten you
in The New Yorker

36:53.169 --> 36:54.503
or in the Encyclopedia Britannica

36:54.588 --> 36:56.338
if I wanted to.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.092
So. . .

37:00.176 --> 37:02.136
why didn't you?

37:03.471 --> 37:05.556
Why would you do that to me?

37:06.683 --> 37:09.268
Why would you put me in that position?

37:24.159 --> 37:27.119
I talked to my father
about the house in Cape May.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.412
He said our dates are good .

37:28.496 --> 37:30.122
August won't be a problem .

37:30.206 --> 37:31.457
That's good .

37:33.209 --> 37:35.377
I wish it wasn't so far from the city.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.588
Then we'd see more of you .

37:37.672 --> 37:40.591
It's not that far.

37:40.675 --> 37:44.762
Well, I hate you
spending August in the office.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.097
Although I liked your girl Peggy.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.182
She's fresh .

37:48.266 --> 37:51.143
As the driven snow.

37:51.227 --> 37:54.647
You sound disappointed .

37:54.731 --> 37:57.149
Did you read some terrible
article in Look magazine

37:57.233 --> 37:59.652
that I should know about?

37:59.736 --> 38:01.236
I like her.

38:02.781 --> 38:07.117
A woman can't just not remark
on her husband's secretary.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.623
Don , are you okay?

38:14.876 --> 38:17.336
No, I just might have
to go back to the office.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.838
I haven't decided yet.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.982
Phone!

39:31.953 --> 39:33.078
Hello.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.706
I need to see you tonight. Are you busy?

39:35.790 --> 39:39.251
For you? Of course not.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.712
Good . I'm leaving now.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.548
From where?

39:44.632 --> 39:45.716
25 minutes.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.302
I don't even know what you drink.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.346
Whatever you have.

40:55.328 --> 40:58.247
I'm so glad you changed your mind .

40:58.331 --> 40:59.540
Come in .

40:59.624 --> 41:02.209
Sit down .

41:04.796 --> 41:06.338
I know it's terrible.

41:06.422 --> 41:10.384
It's temporary, I-- I hope.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.220
Look at you .

41:14.556 --> 41:17.349
You look more like you now.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.360
I came here because
I wanted to talk to you

41:28.444 --> 41:30.112
and explain something to you .

41:30.196 --> 41:32.364
You got to stop that kind of talk.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.449
This isn't so hard .

41:35.994 --> 41:37.995
Adam , listen to me.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.415
I have a life,

41:41.499 --> 41:43.834
and it only goes in one direction :

41:43.918 --> 41:45.961
forward .

41:48.464 --> 41:50.215
What are you drinking?

41:50.300 --> 41:51.383
Gin?

41:51.467 --> 41:54.720
I found it in one
of the offices, under a couch .

41:54.804 --> 41:56.388
Three quarts.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.390
I figured I could take one.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.474
Coffee.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.852
I can do that.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.442
So no Abigail, no Uncle Mack.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.860
Nobody, huh?

42:09.944 --> 42:14.781
I know. It's strange.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.451
Your office is really nice.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.496
I figure from that award
you must be pretty important.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.417
I don't know. I guess so.

42:25.501 --> 42:30.547
Well , everyone always said
you were too smart for your own good .

42:30.632 --> 42:34.426
Of course, Uncle Mack
thought you were soft.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.762
But you're not, are you?

42:36.846 --> 42:39.223
No, I'm not.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.895
What are you doing?

42:50.401 --> 42:52.527
That's $5,000.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.781
That's all there is.

42:55.865 --> 43:00.118
I want you to take it,
and I want you to leave New York,

43:00.203 --> 43:04.122
and I don't want to see
or hear from you ever again .

43:06.918 --> 43:09.503
That's not what I wanted .

43:11.547 --> 43:13.465
That's not right.

43:13.549 --> 43:16.468
That's all I can do for you .

43:17.553 --> 43:20.097
You're serious, aren't you?

43:22.475 --> 43:25.477
You thought I was dead .

43:25.561 --> 43:27.896
Just go back to thinking that.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.482
Where do I go?

43:34.570 --> 43:38.824
Adam , it is $5,000.

43:41.077 --> 43:43.078
Make your own life.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.667
I have too much here.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.785
It's going to be okay.

45:04.911 --> 45:07.204
How'd it go?

45:07.288 --> 45:09.664
Crisis averted?

45:09.749 --> 45:12.751
Yes. Papers were on my desk.

45:14.587 --> 45:17.589
Do you want to go visit the kids?

45:18.591 --> 45:21.593
No, I just want to go to sleep.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.602
I want to talk to you about something,

45:30.686 --> 45:33.688
and I don't want you to get upset.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.532
I won't.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.787
I know you hate going to my family's
house in Cape May,

45:48.871 --> 45:50.622
and I know even though my father--

45:50.706 --> 45:54.459
No, it's great. It's great.

45:54.544 --> 45:56.586
I'm looking forward to it already, I swear.

45:56.712 --> 46:01.258
But I know you don't like
that my father might be there for part of it.

46:01.342 --> 46:04.636
I just don't like
the way he looks at me.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.806
You took away his little girl .

46:08.975 --> 46:15.647
I was thinking maybe we should
just buy a summer house.

46:15.731 --> 46:20.110
Something closer that's ours.

46:20.194 --> 46:23.738
I know we had a good year.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.743
I don't know, Bets.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.748
I think Cape May will be fine.

46:35.251 --> 46:38.086
We're not that flush right now.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.299
There's nothing to be worried about.

46:42.383 --> 46:45.760
I'd just rather wait till next year.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.515
Good .

46:52.768 --> 46:56.480
Because I like seeing my dad .
