01:00.371 --> 01:02.773
Hey. Have you seen Nancy Drew?

01:02.775 --> 01:04.140
Nancy who?

01:04.141 --> 01:05.743
Never mind. Thank you.

01:06.579 --> 01:07.811
Mrs. Shay!

01:07.813 --> 01:09.546
- Hey, have you seen Nancy Drew?
- No.

01:09.548 --> 01:10.616
Thank you.

01:30.101 --> 01:31.368
Sorry, sir! I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:31.370 --> 01:33.870
Watch where you're going, kid.

01:33.872 --> 01:35.440
Hey! Have you seen Nancy Drew?

02:01.332 --> 02:02.665
Drew!

02:02.667 --> 02:04.600
Finally! You didn't answer
your phone.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.971
Sorry,
I don't hear it when I'm skating.

02:07.973 --> 02:09.405
Check it out.

02:09.407 --> 02:11.108
I can't believe anyone
would do this to Bess,

02:11.110 --> 02:12.910
and now it's gone viral.

02:14.045 --> 02:15.210
You know how sensitive
Bess is,

02:15.212 --> 02:16.481
she won't leave the house now.

02:18.684 --> 02:21.118
Please, guys. Go away.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.818
We're not leaving!

02:22.820 --> 02:24.253
Great.

02:24.255 --> 02:26.722
I'm so pathetic, my friends
have to come and rescue me.

02:26.724 --> 02:28.924
I'm an even bigger loser
than I thought.

02:28.926 --> 02:30.393
Okay, if...

02:30.395 --> 02:31.727
If needing your friends
means you're a loser,

02:31.729 --> 02:35.364
then I'm the biggest loser
of all.

02:35.366 --> 02:36.666
'Cause, you guys
make me forget

02:36.668 --> 02:39.501
I live in this one-horse town
every day.

02:39.503 --> 02:41.269
- Jeez.
- Hey.

02:41.271 --> 02:42.838
Hi.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.443
Actually, River Heights
has four horses.

02:46.144 --> 02:47.342
Sorry.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.544
Let me in.

02:48.546 --> 02:50.614
Welcome to the party!

02:51.314 --> 02:53.248
Let's school this troll.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.817
But, we don't even know
who did it.

02:54.819 --> 02:56.587
Oh, isn't it obvious?

02:58.288 --> 03:00.557
Oh, he's just a dill weed.

03:01.458 --> 03:02.659
Can I show you?

03:04.961 --> 03:08.130
I'm so stupid.
I forgot to take my goggles off.

03:08.132 --> 03:09.330
Oh, stop it.

03:09.332 --> 03:11.600
The last thing you are,
is stupid.

03:11.602 --> 03:15.637
<i>Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.
Dirty Bess.</i>

03:15.639 --> 03:18.206
My clothes might not be
as good as everyone else's,

03:18.208 --> 03:19.875
but they're not dirty.

03:19.877 --> 03:21.409
Hey, it looks like a
two-year-old came up with this.

03:21.411 --> 03:22.978
Wish I could fast-forward it.

03:22.980 --> 03:24.713
Just...

03:24.715 --> 03:26.414
Don't look it for a second.

03:26.416 --> 03:30.218
<i>Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.
Dirty Bess.</i>

03:30.220 --> 03:31.721
Everyone saw this.

03:31.723 --> 03:33.621
Don't pay attention
to what a lizard-brain does.

03:33.623 --> 03:35.891
<i>Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess.
Dirty Bess.</i>

03:35.893 --> 03:38.927
There! Someone forgot
to blur out his reflection.

03:38.929 --> 03:41.931
- Presenting...
- Number 91.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.199
Try that again.

03:43.201 --> 03:46.001
It's... It's a reflection.

03:46.003 --> 03:47.069
Nineteen.

03:47.071 --> 03:48.470
Derek freaking Barnes.

03:48.472 --> 03:50.004
- God.
- Should've known.

03:50.006 --> 03:52.239
Derek is making fun of me
all the time.

03:52.241 --> 03:55.445
I know I'm not cute,
or cool, but...

03:56.313 --> 03:58.047
Why can't he just let me be?

03:58.049 --> 03:59.514
What? You're super cute.

04:01.718 --> 04:03.818
Aw! Don't they make
a darling couple?

04:03.820 --> 04:06.554
The idiot spawn of the two
richest families in town.

04:06.556 --> 04:08.157
Nancy Drew,
I know that look.

04:08.159 --> 04:10.558
You can't just go after Derek.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.262
I'm not gonna go after Derek.

04:14.664 --> 04:17.430
I'm just gonna help him
see the light.

04:17.433 --> 04:19.201
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

04:19.202 --> 04:20.567
You've only spent
summers here.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.403
You don't really know Derek
like we do.

04:22.405 --> 04:26.775
But, if we don't stop him,
he'll just do it again to someone else.

04:26.777 --> 04:29.478
Do you guys really want that
on your conscience?

04:33.416 --> 04:34.618
Okay.

04:36.853 --> 04:38.119
I'm in. Fine.

04:38.121 --> 04:39.954
Great! Let's hit the gym.

04:39.956 --> 04:41.055
Wait.

04:41.057 --> 04:44.692
You... You wanna work out?
Like, now?

04:44.694 --> 04:47.427
No, but in order to get ready
for football season

04:47.429 --> 04:48.730
he's gotta super-set.

04:48.732 --> 04:51.801
You know, all the time.
And... Here.

04:54.404 --> 04:56.137
From the timestamp,
it looks like

04:56.139 --> 04:58.573
mid-morning Tuesday is his
favorite time to hog the floor.

04:58.575 --> 05:01.642
That means he'd shower around,
you know, 11:45,

05:01.644 --> 05:04.680
so he could be fresh to play
trainer for the cheerleading squad.

05:06.716 --> 05:07.849
What?

05:07.851 --> 05:10.285
The way your brain works
is so cool.

05:14.723 --> 05:16.657
You know, psychologists say

05:16.659 --> 05:19.027
it's okay for bullies to get a
little taste of their own medicine.

05:19.029 --> 05:21.361
It's called
restorative justice.

05:23.066 --> 05:25.534
Ahhh!

05:31.241 --> 05:33.877
Ahhh! Yeah.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.945
Yes!

05:39.014 --> 05:41.615
<i>What's the most
important thing in Derek's life?</i>

05:41.617 --> 05:44.685
<i>His social media presence,
right?</i>

05:44.687 --> 05:47.423
<i>Let's make a tiny adjustment
to that.</i>

07:06.201 --> 07:09.403
Gold!

07:09.405 --> 07:10.871
Gold!

07:10.873 --> 07:13.539
Gold, gold, gold, gold!

07:13.541 --> 07:14.974
Bess.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.780
Bess, this is perfect!
This is perfect! Okay.

07:27.423 --> 07:29.454
Twenty seconds.

08:21.309 --> 08:23.044
Yes!

08:26.047 --> 08:29.115
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.551
Get up here.

08:34.087 --> 08:35.890
I did something.

08:36.924 --> 08:39.823
Oh, my God. That was so...

08:39.826 --> 08:41.427
Okay.

08:41.429 --> 08:42.861
- I've got everything setup.
- ...so close.

08:42.864 --> 08:44.599
We're ready to go.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.034
- Maple bars, anyone?
- Yes! Can I, please?

08:48.036 --> 08:51.069
Oh, my God!
Maple bars are my thing!

08:51.071 --> 08:52.438
Dig in.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.641
Oh, I probably shouldn't.
My skin is still breaking out.

08:55.643 --> 08:58.310
Eat a donut, Bess. Okay?
Life is short, go.

08:58.312 --> 09:00.014
- Come on.
- We'll share.

09:07.989 --> 09:09.654
So, how long will it take?

09:09.656 --> 09:11.125
I don't know.

09:21.802 --> 09:24.537
Hey, this is my set, not hers!

09:24.539 --> 09:26.807
My bad. I'm all yours now.

09:28.809 --> 09:31.179
Derek! Are you okay?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.582
Never better.

09:39.486 --> 09:41.352
No.

09:41.354 --> 09:43.655
Something is seriously wrong
with you, dude.

09:43.657 --> 09:45.424
Look.

10:00.207 --> 10:03.674
<i>Derek Barnes,
welcome to Thunderdome!</i>

10:03.676 --> 10:05.310
When you humiliate others,

10:05.312 --> 10:07.348
- there will be consequences.
- <i>Stop laughing at me!</i>

10:11.051 --> 10:13.218
<i>She's checking me out.
She's checking me out.</i>

10:13.220 --> 10:15.786
<i>I look good.
She still looking?</i>

10:15.788 --> 10:17.288
<i>Faster.</i>

10:19.059 --> 10:21.292
<i>At least I'm trying.</i>

10:21.294 --> 10:24.562
<i>I'm currently single right now if
you guys are looking for anything.</i>

10:26.399 --> 10:28.600
<i>You can chill at my house
if you guys are interested.</i>

10:35.641 --> 10:38.476
<i>Just make sure you keep
your face below my back,</i>

10:38.478 --> 10:40.711
<i>so, like, my face
is the only thing.</i>

10:40.713 --> 10:43.183
<i>Because, like, if your face is on my
video, it's gonna be ruined.</i>

10:45.051 --> 10:46.551
<i>I'm just waiting
on the machine.</i>

10:52.091 --> 10:54.359
Stop laughing at me. Okay?

10:54.361 --> 10:55.362
Stop laughing at me.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.731
- He's so blue.
- Oh, my God!

11:00.733 --> 11:02.567
This stuff actually works.

11:02.569 --> 11:05.002
I was not expecting that.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.404
That... It works!

11:06.406 --> 11:08.707
- It works! Let's get outta here.
- Phew!

11:13.012 --> 11:16.013
Nobody's ever stood up for me
like that before.

11:16.015 --> 11:17.782
You stood up for yourself.

11:17.784 --> 11:21.051
No, we just added
a little color.

11:21.053 --> 11:22.453
- Aw.
- Thank you.

11:22.455 --> 11:23.555
Of course!

11:23.557 --> 11:25.858
Aww!

11:26.593 --> 11:28.258
You guys are the best.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.328
This town is so much more fun
with you in it, Nancy.

11:30.330 --> 11:33.665
Even if that means we...
get in a lot more trouble.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.266
Oh, come on.
Just a little trouble.

11:36.268 --> 11:38.835
Your daughter
assaulted my son.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.836
That's more than enough
for me to sue.

11:40.838 --> 11:42.773
Go right ahead.

11:42.775 --> 11:46.376
All my daughter did was defend a
young girl your son cyberbullied.

11:46.378 --> 11:47.911
My son did no such thing.

11:47.913 --> 11:49.313
How about we look at the video

11:49.315 --> 11:52.750
that Derek posted
from your IP address?

11:53.953 --> 11:55.852
- This is ridiculous.
- Guys,

11:55.854 --> 11:57.522
let's all calm down a minute.

11:57.524 --> 11:59.623
Under State Penal Code 646.9,

11:59.625 --> 12:02.858
cyberbullying is a crime punishable
by up to five years in prison

12:02.860 --> 12:04.194
and $1,000 in fines,

12:04.196 --> 12:06.466
and that's just for you, Jeff.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.902
This is not over, Counselor.

12:11.270 --> 12:13.005
I promise that.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.273
Are you sure Jeff Barnes

12:17.275 --> 12:19.443
is the type of person
you want to have as an enemy?

12:19.445 --> 12:21.313
I think I can handle him.

12:22.081 --> 12:23.413
I'm sorry about all this.

12:23.415 --> 12:25.948
I'll make sure Nancy pays
for the damages.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.684
That's not gonna be enough,
though.

12:27.686 --> 12:28.985
This is not her first offense,

12:28.987 --> 12:30.887
and she involved
two other girls.

12:30.889 --> 12:32.656
I can't just turn a blind eye.

12:32.658 --> 12:35.659
She has to face
the consequences this time.

12:35.661 --> 12:37.329
What did you have in mind?

12:39.330 --> 12:41.163
Eight hours a day?

12:41.165 --> 12:44.501
Okay, for the next two months, basically
my whole summer just went sideways.

12:44.503 --> 12:47.036
I'm surprised that's all
the community service you got.

12:47.038 --> 12:48.538
You committed
several felonies.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.707
Hey, they're only felonies
if you're 18.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.275
Oh, excellent point,
Counselor.

12:52.277 --> 12:53.510
And, since you're nowhere
near 18,

12:53.512 --> 12:54.678
you are hereby grounded.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.946
I stood up to a bully.

12:56.948 --> 12:58.881
I mean, why should I
get punished for that?

12:58.883 --> 13:00.149
I'm proud of you.

13:00.151 --> 13:01.451
But the way you did it
isn't right.

13:01.453 --> 13:03.654
You stooped to his level.

13:03.656 --> 13:07.457
You pulled a prank that caused
thousands of dollars worth of damage.

13:07.459 --> 13:10.427
They may have to re-tile
the entire shower.

13:10.429 --> 13:13.996
But worst of all,
you involved other girls.

13:13.998 --> 13:15.732
I mean, that dye wears off.

13:15.734 --> 13:20.470
And delivering justice
isn't a prank, it's my duty.

13:20.472 --> 13:21.937
So, is it like last week?

13:21.939 --> 13:23.973
- It was your duty to burn the word "assassin..."
- Okay, no.

13:23.975 --> 13:25.941
- ...into Mr. Blankenship's lawn.
- He was shooting crows, Dad.

13:25.943 --> 13:27.476
That's murder.

13:27.478 --> 13:30.480
If you think that driving
everybody in town crazy

13:30.482 --> 13:32.616
is gonna sabotage things
so bad for us

13:32.618 --> 13:34.850
we have to move back
to Chicago, you're wrong.

13:34.852 --> 13:36.852
- We had a deal.
- We never made a deal.

13:36.854 --> 13:39.821
You know, a deal is when two
people come to an agreement.

13:39.823 --> 13:41.957
You made the decision.

13:41.959 --> 13:44.293
I mean, you never gave me
a real choice.

13:44.295 --> 13:47.029
I wanted to stay in Chicago
with all my friends.

13:47.031 --> 13:49.498
I never wanted to move here.

13:49.500 --> 13:53.101
I couldn't stay there
and you know that.

13:53.103 --> 13:55.772
Knowing everything
about the city

13:55.774 --> 13:58.074
reminded me of your mom.

13:58.076 --> 14:01.312
Yeah, well, maybe
I don't wanna forget her.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.191
Thank you very much.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.527
Vote for the train.

14:18.529 --> 14:20.196
Let's bring some new blood
to this town.

14:20.198 --> 14:23.032
A little culture,
maybe a Chipotle, huh?

14:23.034 --> 14:25.468
You get a burrito.
You get a burrito.

14:25.470 --> 14:27.135
You get a burrito.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.504
Where's my burrito?

14:28.506 --> 14:30.473
Vote for the train,
and you'll get one.

14:30.475 --> 14:32.942
There she is,
straight from the hoosegow.

14:32.944 --> 14:34.945
I got your skateboard there,
sweetheart.

14:36.647 --> 14:38.081
Okay.

14:39.383 --> 14:41.149
- Listen, Nancy.
- Give her some space, Cars.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.651
Support your local business.

14:42.653 --> 14:44.153
Vote for the train.

14:44.155 --> 14:45.920
Here, have a slice.

14:45.922 --> 14:47.723
Maybe you'll come to your senses
and vote for the train, too.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.625
Really? Not the time.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.293
Train won't make anyone wanna
visit this delightful dump anyway.

14:52.295 --> 14:54.530
Hey, River Heights
isn't a dump.

14:54.532 --> 14:57.600
Well, it will be if this train
comes through here.

14:57.602 --> 14:59.435
Listen, I'm fighting

14:59.437 --> 15:01.302
for what makes
this town special.

15:01.304 --> 15:04.339
The charm of it,
the community.

15:04.341 --> 15:06.175
I mean, do you have any idea

15:06.177 --> 15:09.210
how many historical homes
will be knocked to the ground?

15:09.212 --> 15:11.446
Oh, my darling brother,

15:11.448 --> 15:14.516
the train will finally bring
us into the correct century.

15:14.518 --> 15:16.584
Grandpa here wants
to keep using the Stone Ages.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.387
And look,
Nancy thinks you're mental

15:18.389 --> 15:20.556
if you find
this place charming.

15:20.558 --> 15:23.458
Hello, Hannah. I'm right here.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.993
This town needs
something fresh

15:24.995 --> 15:27.028
to shake things up, you know?

15:27.030 --> 15:28.430
Give it a little bad element.

15:28.432 --> 15:30.766
- An edge, right?
- You see what she's doing?

15:30.768 --> 15:34.169
See, your aunt didn't make it
in New York,

15:34.171 --> 15:35.970
and now she thinks
she can bring all that

15:35.972 --> 15:37.439
and her stand-up career here,
too.

15:37.441 --> 15:40.408
Hey, I opened for Amy Schumer,
you know?

15:40.410 --> 15:41.477
Oh!

15:41.479 --> 15:43.712
It was a door, but still. See?

15:43.714 --> 15:45.480
- That was good, you laughed, right?
- That was all right. Yeah.

15:45.482 --> 15:47.115
I could be a big fish
in a smaller pond,

15:47.117 --> 15:48.183
- fill seats at open-mic night.
- Hey.

15:48.185 --> 15:49.918
How you doing, Nate?

15:49.920 --> 15:51.586
Just because more people come
to see your stand-up routine

15:51.588 --> 15:53.656
doesn't mean the jokes
will actually be funny.

15:53.658 --> 15:55.356
Wow, Dad. I didn't know you had it in you.

15:55.358 --> 15:57.793
Oh, sure. Take my pie
and my dreams.

15:57.795 --> 16:00.295
And besides, jailbird,
I thought you were on my side.

16:00.297 --> 16:02.263
Well, this is between you two,
not me.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.732
Okay. I hate to break up
a good family feud,

16:04.734 --> 16:07.837
but it's time we go show people
like your misguided sister here

16:07.839 --> 16:09.270
how wrong they are. Hmm?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.039
I'm charging you
for that pie, Nate.

16:11.041 --> 16:14.274
Hey, I'm just doing my part to
keep my favorite family together.

16:14.276 --> 16:17.245
You guys are all I've got.

16:17.247 --> 16:21.616
Plus, your dad here is the best
lawyer this town's ever seen.

16:21.618 --> 16:23.718
Ew! God, get a room.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.721
Hey, listen, before your dad got
here, this train was a sure thing.

16:26.723 --> 16:29.224
Now, not!

16:29.226 --> 16:30.558
That's how persuasive
this guy is.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.927
Yeah, yeah. All right.
Let's go.

16:32.929 --> 16:34.498
All right, here you go.

16:35.665 --> 16:38.031
All right, my brother
from another mother,

16:38.033 --> 16:39.633
let's go rock
this town hall meeting.

16:39.635 --> 16:41.369
All right. I'd tell you
to break a leg, but...

16:41.371 --> 16:43.540
- But you'd actually mean it.
- Yeah, exactly.

16:45.642 --> 16:46.808
Hey, listen.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.342
I know your dad's a big pain
in the butt,

16:48.344 --> 16:50.177
but he does respect you.

16:50.179 --> 16:53.348
Yeah, if he respected me,
I wouldn't be here.

16:53.350 --> 16:56.151
Come here. Sit with me.

17:01.290 --> 17:03.790
There are no words
for what happened to you.

17:03.792 --> 17:06.429
I can't even begin to know
how you must feel.

17:07.931 --> 17:10.230
Losing your mom.

17:10.232 --> 17:12.465
But, think about your dad.

17:12.468 --> 17:15.602
I mean, he lost
the love of his life.

17:15.604 --> 17:17.505
Living in Chicago
was killing him.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.540
He was turning
into the living dead,

17:19.542 --> 17:22.044
and he didn't want
to be that for you.

17:26.214 --> 17:28.317
I never really thought of it
that way.

17:30.020 --> 17:32.854
And this place isn't half
as bad as you think it is.

17:32.856 --> 17:34.156
Oh...

17:34.958 --> 17:36.490
It kinda totally is.

17:36.492 --> 17:38.959
But, you know,
present company excluded, of course.

17:40.362 --> 17:42.229
Having you here is so cool.

17:42.231 --> 17:43.932
The house is alive again.

17:43.934 --> 17:46.767
And I know this place is
square and a little backwards

17:46.769 --> 17:50.537
but it's nothing us cool girls
can't do something about.

17:52.441 --> 17:55.208
I wish I were half
as brave as you.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.911
You're as persuasive
as your dad,

17:56.913 --> 17:59.379
and as righteous
as your mom was.

17:59.381 --> 18:02.315
Those are superpowers,
you know.

18:02.317 --> 18:05.689
If you use them for good,
imagine who you could be.

18:06.255 --> 18:08.290
I thought I did.

18:13.963 --> 18:16.128
Yeah, I'm just tired of
everyone looking at me, you know?

18:16.130 --> 18:19.568
They're all gonna be working for
you someday. Don't worry about it.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.809
Hey, hey.

18:29.178 --> 18:30.813
Back in the car.

18:33.282 --> 18:34.750
Back in the car.

19:29.471 --> 19:31.406
What is your problem?

19:37.178 --> 19:38.411
Your daddy
better get with the times

19:38.413 --> 19:40.347
and let
that train come to town.

19:41.784 --> 19:45.152
A lot of powerful people
stand to lose a lot of money

19:45.154 --> 19:46.652
if your daddy has his way.

19:46.654 --> 19:47.987
And I promise you,
they will not let that happen.

19:47.989 --> 19:49.889
Let go of me!

19:49.891 --> 19:52.459
Now, I'm not a violent man,
but I will hurt people if I have to.

19:53.361 --> 19:55.062
I'm calling the cops.

19:55.064 --> 19:56.664
Cops care about delinquents?

20:01.368 --> 20:03.169
Do me a favor,

20:03.171 --> 20:07.273
tell your daddy that Willie
Wharton said to get on board

20:07.275 --> 20:09.176
or get out of the way.

20:15.149 --> 20:16.851
He tried to run you down?

20:17.953 --> 20:19.452
I'm gonna kill this guy.

20:19.454 --> 20:21.654
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

20:21.656 --> 20:23.956
You don't even know, do you?

20:23.958 --> 20:25.256
You're worse than Nancy.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.992
Yeah, well, still right here.

20:26.994 --> 20:30.329
That's just what we need is two
Drews arrested on the same day.

20:30.331 --> 20:33.099
Hey, maybe we could have
matching handcuffs.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.935
Listen, I've heard of this guy, Wharton.
He's trouble.

20:35.937 --> 20:39.671
Got fired from the factory,
gets fired from jobs all the time.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.407
- You know Tammy Drucker?
- Uh-huh.

20:41.409 --> 20:42.975
He used to date her.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.344
I'm gonna call her.

20:47.148 --> 20:49.181
Come on, Dad.

20:49.183 --> 20:51.950
This is like the most exciting thing
that's happened since we moved here.

20:51.952 --> 20:56.256
He's not getting away with what he did.
I promise you that.

20:57.191 --> 20:58.323
Okay.

21:08.870 --> 21:10.535
I think blue
really is his color.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.637
It was Mom's favorite.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.173
Thought it was a nice touch.

21:15.175 --> 21:17.912
Oh!

21:20.047 --> 21:21.780
Welcome, convicts.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.815
Let's make this
as pleasant as possible.

21:23.817 --> 21:26.484
So first, the area you want
to hit today is over here.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.520
Pretty dirty area.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.956
Nancy, you know
you can't have that here.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.824
No, I was just
gonna play some music.

21:32.826 --> 21:36.861
Get me and this here felon
in a trash picking mood.

21:36.863 --> 21:41.299
This is community service,
not a rave.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.568
Oh, come on.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.271
I'll let you
choose the playlist.

21:45.273 --> 21:46.540
Hmm?

21:49.408 --> 21:51.075
All right.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.012
No boy bands.

21:53.014 --> 21:55.080
And please, no country.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.674
But my lights exploded.

22:22.676 --> 22:26.743
A ghost moved my furniture.
How can you explain that?

22:26.745 --> 22:29.614
I'm telling you,
my house is haunted.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.482
I don't know
what to tell you, ladies.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.551
I don't do haunted houses.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.087
Sheriff, I have known
this woman my entire life.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.722
And she doesn't scare easily,
and she doesn't lie.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.459
So, can't you just
send someone out?

22:41.461 --> 22:42.727
Are you sure
she isn't drinking

22:42.729 --> 22:44.729
her own special batch
of Kool-Aid?

22:44.731 --> 22:47.198
Young man, young man.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.033
I have stared down Communism.

22:49.035 --> 22:53.805
My choice of a cocktail in
retirement is none of your business.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.874
Um...
Sheriff?

22:55.876 --> 22:58.675
Aren't we supposed
to respect our elders?

22:58.677 --> 23:00.444
Says the delinquent
picking up trash.

23:00.446 --> 23:03.749
No, actually I'm doing this
because I disrespected my peers.

23:05.451 --> 23:07.218
I'm sorry, ladies,

23:07.220 --> 23:09.519
but I can't spare my one and
only deputy for your situation.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.322
Yeah,

23:11.324 --> 23:13.624
'cause River Heights is such
a hotbed of criminal activity.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.560
Keep it up, you're gonna be
picking up trash until Christmas.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.429
Afternoon, ladies.
If you need anything, just give us a call.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.465
- Really?
- Wow.

23:21.467 --> 23:24.234
We gave you a call. Remember?

23:24.236 --> 23:26.637
You shouldn't have to handle
this all by yourselves,

23:26.639 --> 23:28.806
I mean... maybe I can help.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.641
No, it's fine.
We can deal with it.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.410
Now, if you could you wouldn't
have gone to the cops.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.712
Helen, just a minute.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.848
She looks like
a very sweet girl.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.616
- I love your vest.
- Thank you.

23:40.618 --> 23:42.786
Trust me,
we don't want her help.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.256
She's the one who made that
horrible video of Derek

23:45.258 --> 23:48.627
and she thinks she can do whatever
she wants just 'cause her mother died.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.063
That was you?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.733
Um... Yeah.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.504
I think you and I
are gonna get along just fine.

24:00.505 --> 24:03.075
Come here, you.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.979
Uh, Nancy?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.314
Where do you think
you're going?

24:10.316 --> 24:12.217
Oh, I'm taking my 15.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.686
What 15?

24:17.723 --> 24:21.425
The legend dates back to 1885,

24:21.427 --> 24:23.327
when the Colfax brothers,

24:23.329 --> 24:27.897
who build Twin Elms,
Malcolm and Schuyler,

24:27.899 --> 24:31.368
had a falling out
over a woman,

24:31.370 --> 24:33.737
Millicent Andrews.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.106
Malcolm had proposed to her.

24:36.108 --> 24:39.175
She wasn't too jazzed up
about being, you know, married

24:39.177 --> 24:41.878
to the number one
pig farmer in town.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.481
Plus, she was hopelessly in
love with his brother, Schuyler.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.516
Oh, boy.

24:47.518 --> 24:52.154
Legend it has it,
Malcolm killed them both

24:52.156 --> 24:54.391
in a fit of jealousy,

24:54.393 --> 24:57.094
buried them in the walls.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.830
Then,
he offed himself.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.399
Did they ever find the bodies?

25:02.401 --> 25:03.799
No.

25:03.801 --> 25:06.569
But when I listen
very carefully,

25:06.571 --> 25:08.938
I think
I can hear them crying.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.973
You've gotta be kidding me.

25:10.975 --> 25:13.943
I would never kid about a
thing like the Colfax ghosts.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.813
Stop pretend like
you care about any of this.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.248
Well, I don't have to pretend.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.484
She had me at
"people buried in the walls."

25:20.486 --> 25:23.986
You just want to get outta community
service, which you deserve.

25:23.988 --> 25:25.554
Okay. First of all, Helen,

25:25.556 --> 25:28.758
I can't get outta community service.
I already tried.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.427
And, second of all,
aren't you curious

25:30.429 --> 25:33.430
whether or not the Colfax
ghosts are back for revenge?

25:33.432 --> 25:35.231
Oh, my!

25:35.233 --> 25:36.531
What?

25:36.533 --> 25:39.101
You two remind me
of when I was young.

25:39.103 --> 25:42.004
But we had better hair
back in those days.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.176
My best friend and I, Rosie,
we despised each other.

25:47.178 --> 25:50.678
We even fought once
over the same boy...

25:50.680 --> 25:52.982
Chad, Peter...

25:52.984 --> 25:55.686
I don't know.
There were so many of 'em.

25:57.688 --> 26:00.688
We both dated him,
then he jilted both of us.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.226
We became best friends.

26:03.027 --> 26:05.495
Sadly, Rosie moved to Miami.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.165
She loves a man in a Speedo.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.300
It just goes to show you

26:11.302 --> 26:15.339
that sometimes a girl can find her
best friend in her worst enemy.

26:16.173 --> 26:17.308
Huh?

26:18.477 --> 26:19.875
Huh?

26:19.877 --> 26:22.078
- Yeah, no...
- No, sorry.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.613
Hard pass.

26:31.456 --> 26:32.922
Hi!

26:32.924 --> 26:35.592
Perfect timing. I made dinner.

26:38.829 --> 26:41.363
- What did you do now?
- Nothing.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.534
I mean, uh,
today has been incident-free.

26:45.536 --> 26:46.968
It's kind of hard
to get in trouble

26:46.970 --> 26:49.505
when you're working
on a chain gang. So...

26:49.507 --> 26:51.172
Yeah.

26:51.174 --> 26:53.641
- Besides that... Look!
- Mmm-hmm.

26:53.643 --> 26:55.044
- Get right in it. Yeah.
- Okay.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.779
- Sit right here. Don't trip.
- All right.

26:57.781 --> 26:59.881
Tonight, you'll be eating

26:59.883 --> 27:03.418
chicken cacciatore with
twice baked potatoes and...

27:03.420 --> 27:05.154
And what are you gonna...

27:05.156 --> 27:08.457
What did you do this time?
Seriously, what's going on?

27:08.459 --> 27:11.926
Okay, so you know,
I know I'm grounded and all...

27:11.928 --> 27:13.261
- Mmm-hmm.
- But,

27:13.263 --> 27:15.629
maybe you'll let me

27:15.631 --> 27:19.834
help a nice lady end her haunted
house problem tomorrow night.

27:19.836 --> 27:22.806
- Please?
- I don't know, Nancy. I got...

27:24.541 --> 27:26.207
I'm getting ready to go
outta town this weekend.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.841
And... Wait. What?

27:27.843 --> 27:31.313
You guys want me to find more positive
ways to express myself, right?

27:31.315 --> 27:33.848
Then what could be
more positive than helping

27:33.850 --> 27:37.619
a sweet old lady
and witch-grandniece?

27:37.621 --> 27:38.920
Listen, Nancy.

27:38.922 --> 27:40.755
I got a lot going on
right now, okay?

27:40.757 --> 27:42.690
I gotta schmooze
this land owner

27:42.692 --> 27:45.093
and convince him to reject
the train company's offer.

27:45.095 --> 27:47.162
And I can't do that
if I'm worried about you.

27:47.164 --> 27:51.332
Well, think of it as taking
me in protective custody.

27:51.334 --> 27:52.967
Of an octogenarian?

27:52.969 --> 27:55.772
Okay, that old bird can kick
some serious butt if she has to.

27:58.408 --> 28:01.042
Okay, but... But,

28:01.044 --> 28:03.611
you're still grounded,
and remember our agreement.

28:03.613 --> 28:06.314
Yes, of course.

28:06.316 --> 28:11.818
Check in, text, call,
send an owl, send a raven.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.421
Don't worry,
I'll blow up your phone.

28:13.423 --> 28:17.125
- And, I'll vaporize yours right back.
- Okay, Dad.

28:17.127 --> 28:19.360
- Yeah, it didn't really work, did it?
- Not really.

28:19.362 --> 28:20.495
Hey, listen.

28:20.497 --> 28:22.363
The Sheriff's got an eye
on Willie Wharton.

28:22.365 --> 28:24.265
If he gets within 100 feet from
you, they're gonna arrest him.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.967
So, if anything happens,
call Hannah.

28:26.969 --> 28:28.805
If you can't get
a hold of her, call Nate.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.872
Got it.

28:30.874 --> 28:32.706
Nice doing business with you,
Counselor.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.211
Mmm-hmm.

28:35.945 --> 28:37.345
Did you really cook this?

28:39.281 --> 28:40.784
I'm 16.

28:42.586 --> 28:44.487
And leave my jacket here.

28:45.188 --> 28:46.189
Mmm.

28:48.057 --> 28:50.457
I'm here, doing my check-in.

28:50.459 --> 28:52.294
I'm at Twin Elms, yeah.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.296
Okay.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.799
Love you, yeah.

28:57.267 --> 28:58.335
Bye.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.342
We're only staying
for one night, right?

29:07.344 --> 29:08.676
Yeah, why?

29:08.678 --> 29:10.811
No reason.

29:10.813 --> 29:12.879
Okay, look. Just because
my aunt invited you over

29:12.881 --> 29:14.615
doesn't change anything
between us.

29:14.617 --> 29:15.985
I didn't expect it to.

29:17.087 --> 29:19.052
Aunt Flora's very
important to me,

29:19.054 --> 29:22.389
so please promise me you won't make
some kind of a joke about this.

29:22.391 --> 29:24.958
I would never do that.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.594
If she's really
seeing ghosts, then...

29:27.596 --> 29:29.930
I mean, I wanna find out why.

29:29.932 --> 29:32.866
Can we just, you know,
suspend our feud

29:32.868 --> 29:34.635
for just the night?

29:34.637 --> 29:36.670
Fine, whatever.

29:36.672 --> 29:38.071
Good.

29:38.073 --> 29:39.673
I mean, if this place
really is haunted...

29:39.675 --> 29:42.242
today's gonna be exciting!

29:48.783 --> 29:52.389
Did I forget to mention
my great-aunt is a little extra?

29:54.758 --> 29:57.393
You gotta be kidding me.

30:25.421 --> 30:26.952
Skater bear.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.756
You don't see that every day.

30:28.758 --> 30:30.192
You think I'm crazy, huh?

30:30.893 --> 30:32.858
Smidge.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.496
Come in.

30:37.932 --> 30:39.532
Why, thank you.

30:39.534 --> 30:42.835
Hello, darling.
Come on in.

30:45.940 --> 30:50.176
And I'm gonna make
you girls some lemonade.

31:03.391 --> 31:06.125
Holy nutcracker, Batman.

31:06.127 --> 31:08.961
Aunt Flora
does the best she can,

31:08.963 --> 31:11.698
but it's a little
too much house for her.

31:11.700 --> 31:15.634
I always thought she should make it
into a museum and charge admission.

31:15.636 --> 31:18.106
Yeah, I'd pony up for that.

31:22.043 --> 31:23.342
You know who that is?

31:23.344 --> 31:24.810
You're too young
to know who that is?

31:24.812 --> 31:27.513
Of course I know who that is.

31:27.515 --> 31:32.218
Oh, I swear that boy
had hips made of butter.

31:32.220 --> 31:35.121
Not that I danced
with Mick Jagger every night.

31:35.123 --> 31:38.457
Truth be told, I did
cut in on another girl...

31:38.459 --> 31:41.160
for about 20 seconds
till security moved in.

31:41.162 --> 31:42.928
- That's so funny.
- Yeah.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.464
And you have photographic
evidence to prove it.

31:45.466 --> 31:49.602
I know. Which is more than I have
to say about my burlesque career.

31:49.604 --> 31:50.836
- What?
- No.

31:50.838 --> 31:53.272
You were a burlesque dancer?

31:53.274 --> 31:55.408
- Mmm-hmm.
- Why didn't you tell me?

31:55.410 --> 31:58.377
Oh, it's not a conversation
for youngsters.

31:58.379 --> 32:01.347
But that is so cool!
What is your burlesque name?

32:01.349 --> 32:05.050
No, no, no. No, no, no, girls.
I've said quite enough.

32:05.052 --> 32:07.153
No, trust me,
you haven't said enough.

32:07.155 --> 32:09.988
Yeah, come on, please?
One shimmy.

32:09.990 --> 32:12.591
No, come on, those...
All right, fine.

32:22.336 --> 32:24.437
<i>♪ And here she is, boys ♪</i>

32:24.439 --> 32:26.538

32:32.979 --> 32:34.847
Whoo!

32:34.849 --> 32:38.249
You better put that leg down
before you bust a hip.

32:38.251 --> 32:40.920
Thank you so much.

32:40.922 --> 32:43.823
Living all this time
must be amazing.

32:43.825 --> 32:45.691
It has its moments.

32:45.693 --> 32:48.193
Helen, would you
get the apple pie

32:48.195 --> 32:50.564
I've been cooling
in the kitchen, darling?

32:54.202 --> 32:55.967
Just texting
my dad good night.

32:55.969 --> 32:57.738
He keeps tabs on me.

32:58.405 --> 32:59.539
Sure.

33:00.474 --> 33:02.106
So, um...

33:02.108 --> 33:04.743
When do the undead show up?

33:04.745 --> 33:07.979
Sometimes it's weird sounds,

33:07.981 --> 33:10.248
music I didn't turn on...

33:10.250 --> 33:13.685
Then suddenly, the lights
start flickering crazily.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.753
And then...

33:15.755 --> 33:19.157
things just stop making sense.

33:19.159 --> 33:21.861
Don't make sense how?

33:21.863 --> 33:27.365
Unfortunately, one cannot be
told what happens at Twin Elms.

33:27.367 --> 33:30.671
You have to
experience it yourself.

33:31.739 --> 33:35.573
You mean, like, the Matrix?

33:35.575 --> 33:37.909
I knew you'd get
the reference.

33:39.579 --> 33:41.145
What? What, honey?

33:41.147 --> 33:43.314
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

33:43.316 --> 33:44.950
What, darling?
Helen, what is it?

33:44.952 --> 33:46.351
What? What? What?

33:46.353 --> 33:47.986
There was in...
In the window.

33:47.988 --> 33:50.822
It was a face, out the window.
It was looking at me...

33:50.824 --> 33:53.725
- And it was, like, disgusting.
- What do you mean?

33:53.727 --> 33:56.828
It was like a warthog
or something.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.296
The pig farmer.

33:58.298 --> 34:00.765
- Have you seen him before?
- Never in the flesh.

34:00.767 --> 34:02.432
Ew! I hate that word.

34:02.434 --> 34:04.202
- Wait! That thing might still be out there.
- Hope so.

34:04.204 --> 34:06.573
Oh, my gosh.

34:09.275 --> 34:11.442
Baller move, Drew.

34:11.444 --> 34:14.344
Hunting down a ghost in
front of a haunted mansion,

34:14.346 --> 34:16.081
and you forgot to
bring your flashlight.

34:23.657 --> 34:25.688
God. Son of a...

34:25.690 --> 34:27.090
Hey, Nancy.

34:27.092 --> 34:29.362
Flora got you picking up trash
here at Twin Elms, too?

34:32.331 --> 34:34.032
Deputy Patrick?

34:34.034 --> 34:36.132
You scared the bejesus
out of me.

34:36.135 --> 34:37.801
What are you doing out here?

34:37.803 --> 34:41.272
I didn't like the way Sheriff
talked to Flora yesterday,

34:41.274 --> 34:45.409
so I figured I'd come up here
and check the place out myself.

34:45.411 --> 34:50.813
That's awfully nice of you,
and a little random.

34:50.815 --> 34:52.483
Not really.

34:52.485 --> 34:54.819
I've been coming out to
Twin Elms since I was a kid.

34:54.821 --> 34:57.421
Flora actually used to pay me
to mow her lawns in the summer,

34:57.423 --> 34:59.057
before she turned it
purple and pink.

34:59.059 --> 35:00.691
Yeah.

35:00.693 --> 35:03.393
Oh, you haven't happened
to see, uh...

35:03.395 --> 35:06.831
a pig-man running
around, did you?

35:06.833 --> 35:08.332
What?

35:08.334 --> 35:12.235
Helen thought she saw
a pig-mongrel-esque thing.

35:12.237 --> 35:15.472
Oh! So you saw
the Colfax ghost?

35:15.474 --> 35:17.407
You know him?

35:17.409 --> 35:19.676
Everybody in River Heights
knows the story.

35:19.678 --> 35:21.612
But no one's actually
ever seen him in the flesh.

35:21.614 --> 35:24.583
Please. Please don't
say that word.

35:25.818 --> 35:27.884
Fair enough.

35:27.886 --> 35:30.554
You think Jeffrey Barnes
had something to do with it?

35:30.556 --> 35:32.322
You recognized his car?

35:32.324 --> 35:34.825
I went to school with
Derek's older brothers.

35:34.827 --> 35:37.661
Spoiled bunch. All of 'em.

35:37.663 --> 35:39.698
Are you linking them
with the ghost?

35:42.002 --> 35:45.636
Okay, well. I wanna walk the
property once more before I leave.

35:45.638 --> 35:48.170
And call me if
anything else happens.

35:48.172 --> 35:51.240
And tell Flora I'll drop in here
to make sure everything's okay.

35:51.242 --> 35:52.810
Thanks, Deputy.

35:52.812 --> 35:55.545
Maybe you're not as big a tool
as I thought you were.

35:56.782 --> 35:58.448
Why, thank you, Nancy.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.651
Maybe you're not as much of a pain
in the butt I thought you were.

36:00.653 --> 36:03.152
Much obliged.

36:03.154 --> 36:08.225
Oh. You, uh, might have an easier time
getting around with a little more light.

36:08.227 --> 36:11.260
- Here.
- Oh, right. Thanks.

36:11.262 --> 36:12.863
Stay outta trouble.

36:12.865 --> 36:14.563
You know me.

36:14.565 --> 36:16.835
Fortunately, I do.

36:21.239 --> 36:25.207
I told you, Derek and his entire
family are away on vacation.

36:25.209 --> 36:27.578
Mmm-hmm. What a
perfectly timed alibi.

36:28.881 --> 36:30.380
I call.

36:30.382 --> 36:32.783
All right.
I'll see your 10 cents,

36:32.785 --> 36:36.153
and raise you another 10.

36:36.155 --> 36:38.421
Okay, Nancy,
if you're such a genius,

36:38.423 --> 36:42.559
then why would Derek scare me and
my aunt just to get back at you?

36:42.561 --> 36:45.428
You tell me.
Rich people are psychos.

36:45.430 --> 36:48.464
I thought your dad
was a lawyer. And I'm out.

36:48.466 --> 36:50.399
Not that kind of lawyer.

36:50.401 --> 36:54.270
I mean, half of his clients don't
have enough money to pay him.

36:54.272 --> 36:56.607
I forgot your dad's
such a saint.

36:58.509 --> 37:00.511
And your mother, Nancy?

37:01.546 --> 37:04.014
My mom was
a civil rights advocate.

37:04.016 --> 37:09.518
She badgered politicians to open
their eyes and help the little guy.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.021
Did she prank them?

37:12.023 --> 37:15.791
She may have had a more
subtle approach than I do.

37:15.793 --> 37:18.694
Look, there's more than one
black Mercedes in River Heights.

37:18.696 --> 37:21.164
Not with the same
license plate, there isn't.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.832
Make up your mind.

37:22.834 --> 37:24.567
Earlier, you said you didn't
see the license plate clearly.

37:24.569 --> 37:26.535
Derek did not do this.

37:26.537 --> 37:29.106
And when you find out that I am right,
you will owe me a major apology.

37:29.108 --> 37:32.641
If I find out you're right,
I'll vote you for prom queen.

37:32.643 --> 37:34.210
- I'm already prom queen.
- All right, girls.

37:34.212 --> 37:37.815
Girls, this game is not
gonna bet itself. Let's go.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.350
It's just you and me, Flora.

37:41.352 --> 37:42.785
Your move.

37:42.787 --> 37:46.222
All right. Straight flush.
Read 'em and weep.

37:47.925 --> 37:50.594
- Oh, Lord.
- Well, that's creepy.

37:52.330 --> 37:53.896
Oh!

37:53.898 --> 37:55.564
I... I saw it!

37:55.566 --> 37:57.366
- I saw it!
- What did you see?

37:57.368 --> 37:59.302
I don't know. A shadow.

38:51.989 --> 38:53.557
Under the table!

38:59.095 --> 39:01.029
Really?

39:01.031 --> 39:03.164
Cover your eyes, girls!

39:03.166 --> 39:05.102
- Why?
- Just trust me!

39:27.090 --> 39:30.825
Is it just me or are
the light bulbs floating?

39:30.827 --> 39:34.998
Oh, God, I hate this part.

39:43.241 --> 39:46.776
Whatever's happening, there's a
perfectly logical explanation for this.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.144
Totally logical.

39:57.921 --> 40:00.787
What do you usually do
when this happens?

40:00.789 --> 40:02.257
Pray.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.067
Nancy!

40:11.935 --> 40:12.935
Ow!

40:23.213 --> 40:25.579
Let go of me! Nancy!

40:25.581 --> 40:28.683
Oh no, you don't!
No, you don't!

40:28.685 --> 40:31.585
You let her go!
Let her go, I say!

40:31.587 --> 40:34.623
No, no.

40:42.966 --> 40:45.133
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

40:45.135 --> 40:48.771
Come on, guys. Get out of the kitchen.
Out, out, out of the kitchen!

40:51.841 --> 40:53.241
Wait.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.610
Everybody in here, quick.

40:55.544 --> 40:57.180
Come on! Go!

40:58.415 --> 41:00.816
Wait, no!
There's that thing, the pig!

41:02.685 --> 41:04.551
Whatever happens,
don't open this door.

41:04.553 --> 41:05.754
Nancy!

41:17.700 --> 41:19.733
A rubber mask, really?

41:19.735 --> 41:21.704
Step up your game, dude.

41:24.340 --> 41:25.640
Never mind.

41:35.351 --> 41:38.586
Who's scared now, Nancy?

41:46.627 --> 41:49.429
Nancy.
Nancy, it's okay.

41:49.431 --> 41:54.201
Oh, darling, after every
haunting, I get that same awful headache.

41:54.203 --> 41:55.938
It should be gone soon.

41:58.639 --> 42:04.745
Well, I was hoping to wake up and
realize this was all some crazy dream.

42:16.692 --> 42:20.427
Hey, Dad. Everything's great.

42:20.429 --> 42:22.295
We may have had
a ghost sighting.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.131
<i>I wanna
tell you all about it,</i>

42:25.133 --> 42:27.366
<i>but Flora's just about to
serve us some breakfast, so...</i>

42:27.368 --> 42:30.536
Well, that sounds exciting.
I want to hear all about it.

42:30.538 --> 42:33.440
Yeah, yeah, I'll give you the
blow-by-blow when I see ya.

42:33.442 --> 42:34.673
Thanks, Dad.

42:34.675 --> 42:36.742
<i>Okay. Love ya.</i>

42:36.744 --> 42:38.179
Love you more.

42:39.815 --> 42:41.148
Here, dear.

42:41.150 --> 42:43.785
This ought to help
fight off those dragons.

42:44.919 --> 42:47.586
So, what happened exactly?

42:47.588 --> 42:49.655
You saved us from the ghost.

42:49.657 --> 42:54.196
Well, all I remember is screaming like
a baby before everything went black.

42:56.165 --> 43:01.434
And here I thought my cheese was
finally sliding off the cracker.

43:02.804 --> 43:05.472
Now that I know
the haunting is real,

43:05.474 --> 43:08.607
I kinda wish I were senile.

43:08.609 --> 43:13.745
You guys don't think that last night
was actually supernatural, do you?

43:13.747 --> 43:16.116
Well, how else
would you explain it?

43:16.118 --> 43:18.784
I mean, that thing dragged me
around the house at NASCAR speeds,

43:18.786 --> 43:22.621
and then it disappeared and then it
reappeared in another part of the house.

43:22.623 --> 43:25.057
What about the
floating light bulbs?

43:25.059 --> 43:27.093
No, there's gotta be
an explanation.

43:27.095 --> 43:28.263
Like...

43:30.532 --> 43:32.231
Well, so what do we know?

43:32.233 --> 43:35.067
One, we know a black Mercedes
was lurking around Twin Elms.

43:35.069 --> 43:37.735
- Nancy, I told you...
- I know, I know.

43:37.737 --> 43:40.139
I'm just stating
the facts. Okay?

43:40.141 --> 43:42.476
I'll give you a chance
to prove me wrong.

43:42.478 --> 43:45.878
Two, we know somebody came in
here and scared us half to death.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.148
And three, we know
it felt insanely real.

43:49.150 --> 43:51.116
Were all the doors and windows
locked last night?

43:51.118 --> 43:53.719
Oh, yes. I double-check
them every night.

43:53.721 --> 43:55.821
Are you sure?
Maybe... I mean, the...

43:55.823 --> 43:58.857
This is an old house.
Maybe the locks don't work so well.

43:58.859 --> 44:01.895
I had the locks redone
just last year.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.199
Wait, did you guys...

44:07.201 --> 44:08.968
Did you guys notice
these footprints?

44:08.970 --> 44:10.935
I thought that
you did that last night

44:10.937 --> 44:13.805
when you were running
around in the pink grass.

44:13.807 --> 44:15.908
No. No. I wipe my feet.

44:15.910 --> 44:17.345
I'm very well-trained.

45:31.251 --> 45:33.451
As if this house
isn't messy enough.

45:33.453 --> 45:36.822
Yes, somewhere in here,
there must be a...

45:46.233 --> 45:47.864
Whoa.

45:51.505 --> 45:54.507
I can't believe it.

46:03.850 --> 46:05.952
Well, you don't
see that every day.

46:08.421 --> 46:09.822
Mean girls first.

46:11.424 --> 46:13.158
I'm just kidding.

46:17.330 --> 46:18.795
Stay here, Auntie.

46:18.797 --> 46:20.933
You don't have
to tell me twice.

46:41.388 --> 46:44.957
This must have been some kind of
servants' quarters back in the day.

47:03.610 --> 47:05.278
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:12.785 --> 47:14.420
More pink footprints.

47:16.523 --> 47:20.926
Yes! A dark, creepy tunnel.
I told you this was gonna be awesome.

47:39.878 --> 47:41.246
Huh.

47:42.047 --> 47:43.914
Now we know how they got in.

47:43.916 --> 47:45.184
Mmm.

47:53.359 --> 47:56.894
Oh. So that's how they
attacked me with the drawers.

48:01.332 --> 48:03.533
Well, we're gonna have
to break it to Flora

48:03.535 --> 48:06.071
there's no skeletons
in these walls.

48:06.739 --> 48:09.339
Aw, right.

48:09.341 --> 48:12.009
Hey, Nancy, come take
a look at this.

48:16.749 --> 48:19.949
Oh, this must be how
they control the lights.

48:19.951 --> 48:22.454
But I wonder
what this controls.

48:23.921 --> 48:26.555
The ghost must have
an accomplice.

48:26.557 --> 48:27.993
Okay.

48:29.061 --> 48:31.762
But why did it feel so real?

48:31.764 --> 48:34.330
<i>If people expect a ghost,
they'll see a ghost.</i>

48:34.332 --> 48:36.665
I think something more than
suggestion is at work here.

48:36.667 --> 48:40.270
<i>Well, it could have been sound
waves or carbon monoxide.</i>

48:40.272 --> 48:43.305
<i>No, if it was carbon monoxide,
you'd be a ghost, too.</i>

48:43.307 --> 48:45.441
<i>But it could have been
some type of drug.</i>

48:45.443 --> 48:47.209
<i>Could someone have
spiked your food?</i>

48:47.211 --> 48:48.811
Not a chance.

48:48.813 --> 48:50.312
I bought that food yesterday.

48:50.314 --> 48:53.650
No one but the three of us
touched it before dinner.

48:53.652 --> 48:55.484
Well, thanks for the help.

48:55.486 --> 48:57.721
- I'll let you know what we find out.
- <i>Bye.</i>

48:57.723 --> 48:58.923
<i>Later.</i>

48:59.991 --> 49:01.424
What about visitors?

49:01.426 --> 49:03.493
I mean, this place needs
a lot of upkeep.

49:03.495 --> 49:08.063
Maybe the guys who painted your
grass or a plumber, or a carpenter?

49:08.065 --> 49:10.168
Good idea. I'll make a list.

49:14.739 --> 49:17.006
Wow, that's a lot of people.

49:17.008 --> 49:18.441
Mmm-hmm.

49:18.443 --> 49:20.943
I included some
of my gentlemen callers.

49:20.945 --> 49:23.011
Oh, Auntie!

49:23.013 --> 49:25.046
What? Too many?

49:25.048 --> 49:26.983
Never.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.786
Thank you.

49:32.390 --> 49:34.356
Hello, my name's Nancy Drew.

49:34.358 --> 49:36.960
I understand you recently did
some work at Twin Elms.

49:37.762 --> 49:39.729
Hi, this is Helen Corning.

49:39.731 --> 49:42.533
My aunt hired you to
rebuild her gazebo?

49:43.401 --> 49:45.634
You replaced the plumbing?

49:45.636 --> 49:47.168
You did the plaster work?

49:47.170 --> 49:49.572
You replaced the windows?

49:49.574 --> 49:53.010
Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean to call you.

49:54.445 --> 49:55.480
Really?

49:56.647 --> 49:58.281
Are you sure about that?

49:59.316 --> 50:02.650
No, that's great.
Yes, yes, thank you.

50:02.652 --> 50:04.255
The air conditioner!

50:05.989 --> 50:08.223
Hmm.

50:08.225 --> 50:10.593
You said the repairman
came over two weeks ago,

50:10.595 --> 50:13.394
but the company had no record
of sending anyone.

50:13.396 --> 50:16.365
Wait. What is this thing?

50:16.367 --> 50:19.035
There's a hose
connected to the AC.

50:20.771 --> 50:23.806
I don't know, but it
was taped to the pole.

50:23.808 --> 50:25.573
What is that?

50:25.575 --> 50:27.576
We should
take that to the police.

50:27.578 --> 50:30.312
Yeah, well,
let me connect the dots first.

50:30.314 --> 50:32.080
We have to get this
to the chem lab,

50:32.082 --> 50:34.349
you know, isolate the chemicals,
find out where it came from.

50:34.351 --> 50:37.652
And you just so happen to know a
chemist that can help us with that?

50:37.654 --> 50:40.956
No, but I know someone who can.
Bess and George.

50:43.761 --> 50:47.464
Oh, God. Oh, man. I'm late
for community service.

50:48.298 --> 50:50.465
Chemicals?

50:50.467 --> 50:51.967
Identification is no problem.

50:51.969 --> 50:53.702
I got chromatography papers
in the lab at school

50:53.704 --> 50:55.671
and this sick new chem app
on my phone. So, it's okay.

50:55.673 --> 50:58.306
- Okay.
- Drew!

50:58.308 --> 51:00.441
You took advantage
of Deputy Patrick yesterday,

51:00.443 --> 51:02.777
but you're not taking
advantage of me.

51:02.779 --> 51:06.749
Well, hey, I can talk and pick
up trash at the same time.

51:06.751 --> 51:08.783
Not on my watch.

51:08.785 --> 51:11.386
If you don't get back to work, I'm gonna
add two more weeks to your sentence.

51:11.388 --> 51:14.054
Oh, come on.
Why stop at two?

51:14.056 --> 51:16.959
- Nancy.
- We can make it four, if you want.

51:16.961 --> 51:18.359
Here.

51:18.361 --> 51:20.295
So you don't end up
with a life sentence.

51:20.297 --> 51:21.665
This should help.

51:26.335 --> 51:28.839
Get out of my sight, Drew.
You're free to go.

51:39.817 --> 51:41.749
What just happened?

51:41.751 --> 51:43.117
What does it look like?

51:43.119 --> 51:45.152
I mean, I got Nancy pardoned.

51:45.154 --> 51:46.521
One of the
lesser-known advantages

51:46.523 --> 51:48.488
of being from the oldest
family in River Heights.

51:48.490 --> 51:51.025
Don't you mean "richest"?

51:51.027 --> 51:53.163
Don't you mean, "Thank you"?

51:53.930 --> 51:55.298
You guys coming or what?

51:55.732 --> 51:56.866
Come on.

51:57.701 --> 51:59.234
I'm gonna...

52:10.579 --> 52:12.379
<i>Hey, you behaving?</i>

52:12.381 --> 52:14.915
Of course.
How's your trip?

52:14.917 --> 52:16.951
<i>Well, I'm leaving now.</i>

52:16.953 --> 52:18.786
<i>I'll text you when I get there.
It'll be a couple of hours.</i>

52:18.788 --> 52:21.457
- Okay. Love ya.
- <i>Love you more.</i>

52:22.792 --> 52:25.626
Am I the only one not cool
with Helen being here?

52:25.628 --> 52:27.729
Her great-aunt is
the one in trouble.

52:27.731 --> 52:29.397
So, what,

52:29.399 --> 52:31.766
you make nice with the nerdy
chicks until you get what you want?

52:31.768 --> 52:34.401
Hey, you're the ones
who attacked my boyfriend.

52:34.403 --> 52:36.670
After he harassed Bess online.

52:36.672 --> 52:37.904
Hey, guys.

52:37.906 --> 52:40.508
This isn't about our problem.
It's about Flora.

52:40.510 --> 52:43.310
So let's just isolate
whatever's in this tank,

52:43.312 --> 52:45.712
and we can talk later. Okay?

52:45.714 --> 52:46.882
Fine.

52:47.850 --> 52:50.917
So... How do we get in?

52:50.919 --> 52:53.353
Well, I figured you know
how to pick a lock.

52:53.355 --> 52:55.857
Oh. So I get in
a little trouble with the fuzz

52:55.859 --> 52:57.724
and now I'm public
enemy number one?

52:57.726 --> 53:00.761
- No, I just thought that...
- Seriously, Nance,

53:00.763 --> 53:02.261
you gonna pick
the lock or what?

53:02.263 --> 53:03.933
Well, yeah, totally.

53:05.334 --> 53:06.903
Don't worry about it.

53:15.879 --> 53:18.914
Sorry. This...
This takes all night.

53:26.922 --> 53:29.423
You can't even go a night
without talking to your bae?

53:33.462 --> 53:36.797
Okay. You guys are just jealous
because you don't have anyone.

53:36.799 --> 53:39.599
Oh, you mean, no one
to hide behind?

53:39.601 --> 53:41.835
Okay.

53:41.837 --> 53:44.705
Who's still hungry?
I know I am.

53:44.707 --> 53:47.674
Maybe now's a good time to
break out that cheesecake.

53:47.676 --> 53:48.844
Okay.

53:49.644 --> 53:50.812
Good idea.

53:51.714 --> 53:53.747
Come on, guys, take a bite.

53:53.749 --> 53:56.083
Yeah, this is seriously
God's cheesecake.

53:56.085 --> 53:57.684
Oh, blueberry.

53:57.686 --> 53:59.351
That remind you
of anyone, Helen?

54:05.194 --> 54:07.728
We're not gonna
eat traitor cake.

54:07.730 --> 54:10.999
Technically, Helen's not a traitor.
She's just our enemy.

54:13.701 --> 54:17.003
Probably shouldn't eat any
anyways, my skin is a mess.

54:17.005 --> 54:20.207
Well, if you don't wanna eat
cheesecake, that's fine, don't eat it.

54:20.209 --> 54:23.442
But you really shouldn't worry about
sweets giving you pimples, Bess.

54:23.444 --> 54:25.878
That's the best thing
about being so smart.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.716
You don't have to look pretty.
You won't be going out, anyways.

54:29.718 --> 54:31.952
- You're freaking dead.
- Let's go for it.

54:31.954 --> 54:33.586
Guys, stop!

54:33.588 --> 54:35.554
I can sit here and pretend
to be polite,

54:35.556 --> 54:38.057
but it doesn't change the fact that
she's the girlfriend of some guy

54:38.059 --> 54:40.459
that thinks it's okay to
humiliate another human being.

54:40.461 --> 54:43.429
You know exactly what he did,
and you did nothing to stop it.

54:43.431 --> 54:45.031
What was I supposed to do?

54:45.033 --> 54:47.399
I don't know. You could've
unfollowed him on Instagram,

54:47.401 --> 54:49.068
threatened to
break up with him,

54:49.070 --> 54:51.570
expressed even the slightest
shred of disapproval.

54:51.572 --> 54:54.908
That's so easy for you to say.
You have nothing to lose.

54:54.910 --> 54:56.976
Maybe, but at least
I still have my soul.

54:56.978 --> 55:00.446
- George, come on...
- Nancy, are you that blind?

55:00.448 --> 55:03.786
What, just because you found a new
friend that's more popular than we are?

55:05.053 --> 55:07.753
Well, is that really
what you think of me?

55:07.755 --> 55:09.822
I don't know what
to think anymore, Nance.

55:09.824 --> 55:12.091
But I do know that as soon
as all of this is over,

55:12.093 --> 55:15.095
she's gonna go right back to laughing
at all of us behind our backs.

55:15.097 --> 55:17.730
You don't know what
it's like to be me.

55:17.732 --> 55:20.633
People are constantly
expecting things out of me,

55:20.635 --> 55:22.768
like how I look,
and who I can hang out with,

55:22.770 --> 55:26.471
- and who I don't hang out with and...
- Oh, blah, blah, blah.

55:26.473 --> 55:28.574
"Don't hate me because
I'm rich and pretty."

55:28.576 --> 55:31.010
- I didn't say that!
- Then what did you say?

55:31.012 --> 55:33.746
'Cause I sure didn't hear
a "sorry" anywhere in there.

55:33.748 --> 55:36.951
I don't know,
but I am sorry.

55:41.290 --> 55:43.055
It's ready.

55:45.458 --> 55:48.160
Look, Helen.

55:48.162 --> 55:52.498
I appreciate you, you know,
getting me outta community service.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.969
I get it. I should go.

55:56.904 --> 55:59.404
And I'll let you know
what we find out.

55:59.406 --> 56:00.740
Thank you.

56:05.613 --> 56:07.380
Good riddance.

56:08.149 --> 56:09.816
Come on, you guys.

56:10.817 --> 56:12.018
It's over.

56:17.258 --> 56:19.225
Mmm.

56:19.227 --> 56:22.694
Does anyone smell butterscotch
pudding, like, on a burning tire?

56:22.696 --> 56:25.063
I was gonna say, uh...

56:25.065 --> 56:26.464
bug spray souffle.

56:26.466 --> 56:27.969
That's eggnog on fire.

56:40.047 --> 56:43.514
It is the same chemical
found in all of those things.

56:43.516 --> 56:44.983
Myristicin.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.885
Myristi-what?
What is that?

56:46.887 --> 56:49.519
It's a psychoactive compound
isolated from nutmeg.

56:49.521 --> 56:52.124
So, somebody made us
see ghosts with nutmeg?

56:52.126 --> 56:54.959
Yeah. You know,
it's a little-known fact,

56:54.961 --> 56:57.228
but if it's consumed
in high enough concentrations,

56:57.230 --> 56:59.797
it can cause all types of physical
reactions, like nausea or hallucinations,

56:59.799 --> 57:01.733
and then you wake up
with a really nasty hangover.

57:01.735 --> 57:03.601
You said the hose was
connected to the vent,

57:03.603 --> 57:07.239
so someone had a way of releasing
the chemical when the AC was on.

57:07.241 --> 57:10.407
Didn't know you knew so much
about hallucinogenic drugs.

57:10.409 --> 57:12.442
Chemistry's awesome.

57:12.444 --> 57:15.747
But it says that you'd need a lot of
nutmeg before you could get any effect.

57:15.749 --> 57:19.284
Well, the concentration in that canister
was 50 times more powerful and aerosolized,

57:19.286 --> 57:21.052
so it hit your
brains instantly.

57:22.289 --> 57:25.123
So somebody must be
buying a lot of nutmeg.

57:25.125 --> 57:27.359
Can you guys track
that down in the morning?

57:27.361 --> 57:31.462
Uh-oh! It is morning.

57:31.464 --> 57:34.733
I better go over to Derek's house
and try to get him to confess.

57:35.768 --> 57:37.335
I'm taking the evidence.

57:37.337 --> 57:38.803
Is this safe to carry?

57:38.805 --> 57:42.573
Yeah. Just don't drop it.

57:42.575 --> 57:44.909
I said don't.
Okay, just don't...

57:44.911 --> 57:48.046
Yeah, just don't drop it.
It's not funny.

57:48.048 --> 57:50.582
Stop messing with her.

57:52.352 --> 57:54.054
Not funny.

57:55.388 --> 57:56.520
It can kill people.

57:56.522 --> 57:57.890
Call Dad.

58:01.026 --> 58:03.695
<i>You've reached
Carson Drew. Please leave a message.</i>

58:03.697 --> 58:05.096
That's weird.

58:05.098 --> 58:06.731
Hey, Dad, it's me.

58:06.733 --> 58:09.169
I didn't get a text
from you. Call me.

59:25.710 --> 59:26.843
Busted.

59:26.845 --> 59:28.479
Well, well.

59:28.481 --> 59:30.115
Now what do we have here?

59:32.951 --> 59:35.385
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a little?

59:35.387 --> 59:37.820
- I caught you breaking into their house.
- It wasn't the house.

59:37.822 --> 59:39.457
It was the garage,

59:39.459 --> 59:41.792
and I was only trying to see
if the car had any evidence

59:41.794 --> 59:43.794
to connect it with
the haunting of Twin Elms.

59:43.796 --> 59:46.196
Which, by the way, it does.

59:46.198 --> 59:47.930
Oh, yeah. Uh...

59:47.932 --> 59:50.199
Pink flamingo paint.

59:50.201 --> 59:51.968
Damning evidence,
if I ever saw any.

59:51.970 --> 59:53.970
Yeah, actually,
it is damning evidence.

59:53.972 --> 59:56.774
Cheese and rice, Nancy, again?

59:57.708 --> 59:59.809
Handcuffs, really?

59:59.811 --> 01:00:02.712
Don't worry, Hannah.
I've started thinking nickel's my color.

01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:06.483
Your niece here was caught
breaking into the Barnes household.

01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:09.519
- Is that true?
- Depends on how you mean "true."

01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:14.589
Nancy, I explicitly said, "Don't go
into the garage till I get there."

01:00:14.591 --> 01:00:17.760
Wait. You knew about this?

01:00:17.762 --> 01:00:21.565
Yeah. I told her about it.

01:00:21.567 --> 01:00:25.668
Yeah, after Deputy Patrick checked
out Twin Elms the other night,

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.972
he suggested we go to, uh...

01:00:28.974 --> 01:00:31.441
uh, go investigate
the Barnes' Mercedes.

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:33.410
I didn't want Nancy
to get in trouble again,

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:36.245
so I told her I'd go
over there with her.

01:00:36.247 --> 01:00:39.149
Must have gotten
our signals crossed.

01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:41.118
I thought Deputy Patrick
left me hanging,

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.918
so I decided to
take a look myself.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.321
With a lock pick set?

01:00:45.323 --> 01:00:47.323
It's perfectly legal
to own lock picks.

01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:49.959
Up until the point where you
stick them in someone else's lock.

01:00:49.961 --> 01:00:52.061
Look, I can vouch for Nancy.

01:00:52.063 --> 01:00:55.933
Sorry.
Good luck with that.

01:00:57.401 --> 01:00:58.934
If you let her go,

01:00:58.936 --> 01:01:00.271
I'll make sure she gets home
without any more trouble.

01:01:07.513 --> 01:01:09.478
What just happened in there?

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.048
Wasn't gonna let my boss arrest the
bravest kid in town twice in one week.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.151
No one's ever stood up
to the Barnes' family before.

01:01:15.153 --> 01:01:17.386
Because no one's
ever been that dumb.

01:01:17.388 --> 01:01:19.655
Where were you last night?

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:21.457
I told you.
I stayed at Bess'.

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:23.259
Really? Then why did Bess' mom

01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:25.229
think that she was
staying with us?

01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:29.732
'Cause... 'Cause Bess,
George, Helen and I

01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:31.400
broke into the high school

01:01:31.402 --> 01:01:35.538
and used the chem lab to
isolate a hallucinogenic drug

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.005
that's making
Flora see ghosts,

01:01:37.007 --> 01:01:39.609
but we left everything
the way we found it...

01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:41.110
That's not exactly the point.

01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:43.112
Nancy, you are out of control.

01:01:43.114 --> 01:01:44.812
You can't just do
whatever you want

01:01:44.814 --> 01:01:46.350
and expect
to get away with it.

01:01:47.251 --> 01:01:50.051
Look...
I made some calls.

01:01:50.053 --> 01:01:53.889
Barnes' family checked in to the
Pike's Resort in Aspen four days ago.

01:01:53.891 --> 01:01:55.359
Haven't left since.

01:01:56.594 --> 01:01:58.594
So, Helen was right, but...

01:01:58.596 --> 01:02:01.097
- Who was driving the car to Twin Elms?
- I don't know.

01:02:02.299 --> 01:02:04.033
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:05.900
The police
are doing their job,

01:02:05.902 --> 01:02:09.505
but next time you think about
pulling a B&E,

01:02:09.507 --> 01:02:12.440
try giving me a call first.

01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.845
There's some people in this
town who actually care.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.147
Okay, this time you
are really grounded.

01:02:19.149 --> 01:02:22.050
No fake sleepovers
or haunted houses or...

01:02:22.052 --> 01:02:24.652
Especially investigations.

01:02:24.654 --> 01:02:26.723
And I'm confiscating
your long board.

01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:30.593
Has Dad called you?

01:02:30.595 --> 01:02:34.028
No, but we don't usually argue
until after lunch.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.398
Why? You mean
he hasn't called you?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.368
- No.
- Since when?

01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:46.107
Hey, Nance. What up?

01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:47.942
<i>My dad hasn't texted</i>

01:02:47.944 --> 01:02:50.411
<i>or returned a call from
me or Hannah in 15 hours.</i>

01:02:50.413 --> 01:02:52.448
<i>You know
how weird that is, Nate.</i>

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.881
We have a rule.
Last thing at night

01:02:53.883 --> 01:02:55.383
and first thing
in the morning.

01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:57.318
You know, no exceptions.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.554
Yeah, I haven't
heard from him either.

01:02:59.556 --> 01:03:02.290
Well, maybe there's no cell
service at the campsite.

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:03.626
Campsite? I...

01:03:03.628 --> 01:03:06.794
I thought you said he...
I thought he was at a hotel.

01:03:06.796 --> 01:03:09.030
No, no.

01:03:09.032 --> 01:03:11.733
This dude that your dad's
meeting, Owen Michaelson,

01:03:11.735 --> 01:03:14.402
will only close the deal
if you go camping with him.

01:03:14.404 --> 01:03:17.606
<i>Like real camping.
Like backpacks and canteens.</i>

01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:19.809
<i>The cell service
is probably terrible there.</i>

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:22.610
But that's not like him.

01:03:22.612 --> 01:03:23.977
I mean, ever since Mom died

01:03:23.979 --> 01:03:26.380
he's been even more anal
about calling than I am.

01:03:26.382 --> 01:03:27.882
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:03:27.884 --> 01:03:31.352
I'm sorry, hon.
I didn't realize he hadn't told you.

01:03:31.354 --> 01:03:33.488
<i>I got caught up
in all this train paperwork</i>

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:35.356
<i>and didn't think
to check on you.</i>

01:03:35.358 --> 01:03:38.627
<i>I'm falling down
on my godfather duties.</i>

01:03:38.629 --> 01:03:41.896
<i>If he calls, I will make sure
that you talk to him.</i>

01:03:41.898 --> 01:03:44.465
- Okay, Nate. Thanks.
- <i>Sure thing.</i>

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:46.033
Well, who'd have thunk?

01:03:46.035 --> 01:03:49.271
Carson camping.
Huh, that's a relief.

01:04:22.438 --> 01:04:23.439
No phone number.

01:04:30.846 --> 01:04:33.280
- Hey.
- We found the spice company.

01:04:33.282 --> 01:04:35.248
Bess and I are suiting
up to go on our way

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.384
into their records room
right now.

01:04:37.386 --> 01:04:38.919
<i>They'll never know
what hit them.</i>

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:40.555
You sound weird.

01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:44.026
My dad hasn't called
in 18 hours. I mean...

01:04:45.494 --> 01:04:46.859
something's off

01:04:46.861 --> 01:04:48.228
and I can't
put my finger on it.

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.995
<i>Your gut
is usually right, Drew.</i>

01:04:49.997 --> 01:04:51.867
<i>When in doubt, listen to it.</i>

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:54.937
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

01:05:19.894 --> 01:05:23.530
Holy cow!
You scared...

01:05:23.532 --> 01:05:27.136
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
Are you okay? What happened?

01:05:27.704 --> 01:05:28.971
Yeah.

01:05:31.106 --> 01:05:33.609
I know I'm the last person
you wanna see right now,

01:05:34.942 --> 01:05:38.310
but I broke up with Derek.

01:05:38.312 --> 01:05:40.547
Wow, I did't know
you had it in you.

01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:41.848
What did he do?

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:44.351
Nothing, it was all me.

01:05:44.353 --> 01:05:46.185
Look, sorry,
can we talk about this in the car?

01:05:46.187 --> 01:05:49.155
- Huh? Yeah.
- My aunt's car. Come on.

01:05:49.157 --> 01:05:50.924
Can you drive?

01:05:50.926 --> 01:05:51.992
Technically...

01:05:54.496 --> 01:05:56.430
You know,
George was right about me.

01:05:56.432 --> 01:05:58.598
I mean, what I said about Bess
was horrible.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.901
Who would say that
about another person?

01:06:00.903 --> 01:06:02.469
You've got a point.

01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:05.137
But the thing is I don't
even know why I said it.

01:06:05.139 --> 01:06:08.575
It just came
out of my mouth like...

01:06:08.577 --> 01:06:12.144
I guess some part of me was
still trying to defend Derek.

01:06:12.146 --> 01:06:14.313
I really like Bess.

01:06:14.315 --> 01:06:16.450
In a different world,
we'd be friends.

01:06:23.357 --> 01:06:24.989
You skate a lot better
than you drive.

01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:27.028
No one drives in Chicago.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:37.736
Look, just...

01:06:37.738 --> 01:06:40.105
Just do what you think
is right, you know?

01:06:40.107 --> 01:06:44.009
Don't do what other people
expect you to do.

01:06:44.011 --> 01:06:46.278
That's so freakin' terrifying.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.680
And you have no idea.

01:06:47.682 --> 01:06:51.016
It's just so easy for you
and George and Bess

01:06:51.018 --> 01:06:53.118
because you're just
so good at things.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.488
Important things,
that matter.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:58.491
And you're funny
and you're smart.

01:06:58.493 --> 01:07:01.359
What do I have
other than my hair and Derek?

01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:04.165
Well, you actually
don't have Derek anymore.

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:09.067
Your hair's amazing.

01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:13.706
You know, I'm supposed to be the hero
in my own story but I'm the villain.

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:17.076
I mean, I've never
had to be brave or smart

01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:19.778
and definitely
never had to be nice.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.747
Maybe now's your chance.

01:07:21.749 --> 01:07:24.050
At least the brave part.
Nice we can...

01:07:25.418 --> 01:07:26.920
work on.

01:07:26.922 --> 01:07:28.422
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:29.757 --> 01:07:32.391
And speaking of nice, how...

01:07:32.393 --> 01:07:34.727
How good are you
at accepting apologies?

01:07:34.729 --> 01:07:36.764
Apologies? For what?

01:07:38.299 --> 01:07:41.166
I was wrong
about the Barnes' alibi.

01:07:41.168 --> 01:07:42.701
I told you, Nancy Drew.

01:07:42.703 --> 01:07:46.137
I'm sorry. No,
I should have believed you.

01:07:46.139 --> 01:07:49.507
I'd grovel at your feet...

01:07:49.509 --> 01:07:51.844
but I'm having a little
trouble driving.

01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:55.716
You have no idea
how good it feels to be right.

01:07:57.852 --> 01:07:59.319
And there's one other thing.

01:08:02.356 --> 01:08:05.591
I think that whole
vigilante justice

01:08:05.593 --> 01:08:08.259
might not be the direction
I wanna go in for my future.

01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:11.296
Are you apologizing
about Derek?

01:08:11.298 --> 01:08:15.703
I don't... I don't know if I wanna
go that far, you know, but...

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:21.774
Can I just say that maybe

01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:24.809
revenge isn't the answer.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:26.212
That sort of thing.

01:08:27.747 --> 01:08:28.948
Thank you, Nancy.

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:30.317
Yeah, well...

01:08:31.685 --> 01:08:35.522
Just don't wanna be
that girl, you know?

01:08:37.991 --> 01:08:40.358
So I guess we have no suspect.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:42.362
Oh, I've got ideas, but...

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:46.166
Well, I've gotta
find my dad first.

01:08:47.801 --> 01:08:49.265
Let's start this car again.

01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:05.719
Yo! What gives?

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.886
I can't do this.
You gotta... You gotta go.

01:09:09.889 --> 01:09:11.889
You're the chemistry genius.

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:14.192
Anyone asks me a serious question,
the ruse ain't gonna hold.

01:09:14.194 --> 01:09:17.428
You'll be fine. I can tell you
everything you need to know.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:19.430
Yeah, I will be fine

01:09:19.432 --> 01:09:21.866
because you're
gonna go in there

01:09:21.868 --> 01:09:22.868
and you're gonna do this.

01:09:27.173 --> 01:09:28.575
See? Look at you.

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:32.444
I have one
tiny adjustment though.

01:09:33.178 --> 01:09:35.279
Oh... Oh.

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:39.618
See? You look dangerous.

01:09:42.555 --> 01:09:43.921
I feel kinda dangerous.

01:09:43.923 --> 01:09:46.356
Feel empowered
just standing next to you.

01:09:46.358 --> 01:09:49.795
Now, go in there,
track down some nutmeg.

01:09:50.563 --> 01:09:52.296
Okay.

01:09:52.298 --> 01:09:54.400
- Got it. Yeah.
- You got it.

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:13.719
Got his room key.

01:10:15.622 --> 01:10:16.623
Dad?

01:10:17.523 --> 01:10:19.957
Dad, are you here?

01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:22.928
Hey, who leaves their cell
phone during a business trip?

01:10:31.503 --> 01:10:32.869
After I talked to him
last night

01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.237
he never got
any of my messages.

01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:37.541
I mean, Nate said
he was out of cell range.

01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:39.509
I mean, this makes no sense.

01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:42.414
Okay, stay focused.
What are the clues?

01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:48.552
I don't know.
I have no idea.

01:10:48.554 --> 01:10:51.889
Okay, take a deep breath

01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:53.425
and do your thing.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.427
You got this.

01:11:02.969 --> 01:11:05.769
Maybe we got something
better than clues.

01:11:05.771 --> 01:11:08.105
I already gave you
the keys to the room.

01:11:08.107 --> 01:11:11.641
You are not getting access
to the security feed, too.

01:11:11.643 --> 01:11:13.809
I told you this is a
matter of life and death.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:17.013
"I told you this is
a matter of life and death."

01:11:17.015 --> 01:11:18.715
Don't mock me.

01:11:18.717 --> 01:11:21.852
Clearly you care about
customer satisfaction.

01:11:21.854 --> 01:11:23.254
Not really.

01:11:39.605 --> 01:11:40.470
Ooh!

01:11:40.472 --> 01:11:41.772
Someone put a little more

01:11:41.774 --> 01:11:43.405
than cream and sugar
in this.

01:11:43.407 --> 01:11:46.442
Get out of here!
This is nothing but coffee.

01:11:46.444 --> 01:11:48.980
Then why is it so sticky?

01:11:50.849 --> 01:11:52.414
Ugh!

01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:54.017
Well, your boss
is not gonna like it

01:11:54.019 --> 01:11:56.554
when he finds out you've
been drinking on the job.

01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:02.293
Here it is.

01:12:15.974 --> 01:12:18.942
What's he doing to my dad?

01:12:18.944 --> 01:12:21.610
It looks like he's
just putting him to sleep.

01:12:21.612 --> 01:12:23.279
Yeah, but how do
we know that?

01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:24.880
If he wanted to hurt your dad

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:27.920
he would've used a gun
or a knife or something.

01:12:30.088 --> 01:12:31.954
It can't be a robbery.

01:12:31.956 --> 01:12:34.323
All he wanted was my dad.

01:12:34.325 --> 01:12:36.025
Well, at least we know
what happened.

01:12:36.027 --> 01:12:38.329
We have the evidence,
we can go to the police.

01:12:41.532 --> 01:12:43.634
Can't see
the kidnapper's face.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.447
Oh, man.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:05.288
Wait, wait.
It looks really familiar.

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:07.391
Come on, Drew, think.

01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:10.828
Anything?

01:13:24.242 --> 01:13:27.111
This happened last night
while we were at the chem lab.

01:13:33.184 --> 01:13:34.549
<i>We did it, Nancy.</i>

01:13:34.551 --> 01:13:35.717
<i>You would have been
so proud of me.</i>

01:13:35.719 --> 01:13:37.219
What are you talking about?

01:13:37.221 --> 01:13:38.420
<i>Bess found the name
of the nutmeg buyer.</i>

01:13:38.422 --> 01:13:39.490
<i>It's William Wharton.</i>

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.590
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:45.595
<i>Tell your daddy that Willie
Wharton said to get onboard.</i>

01:13:46.364 --> 01:13:47.495
<i>Now get out of the way.</i>

01:13:49.432 --> 01:13:51.267
Wharton kidnapped my dad.

01:13:51.269 --> 01:13:53.102
He's been haunting Twin Elms.

01:13:53.104 --> 01:13:56.638
Look, look, guys, I love you guys
so much and everything, but...

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.507
I gotta go.
Talk to you...

01:13:59.509 --> 01:14:01.977
Call you when I know more.
Okay? Bye.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:04.414
We have the evidence.
Let's get help.

01:14:06.117 --> 01:14:08.616
Deputy? Yes,
I figured out a bunch of stuff.

01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:10.053
Can you meet me at Twin Elms?

01:14:10.987 --> 01:14:11.988
Thanks.

01:14:13.823 --> 01:14:16.491
I think my dad's
in the hidden staircase.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.193
Wharton doesn't know
we know it exists,

01:14:18.195 --> 01:14:20.563
and he kidnapped my dad
after we left.

01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:22.632
Come on.

01:14:42.485 --> 01:14:43.551
Sheriff?

01:14:45.655 --> 01:14:47.654
Trying you again. Sheriff?

01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.964
<i>Deputy Patrick. Come in. Over.</i>

01:15:23.259 --> 01:15:25.426
Oh, my God.

01:15:25.428 --> 01:15:28.262
- Deputy? Deputy, wake up.
- Okay.

01:15:28.264 --> 01:15:32.268
Okay. He's not dead,
he's just really knocked out.

01:15:37.139 --> 01:15:38.908
Wharton must be here.

01:16:01.663 --> 01:16:03.166
Dumb flashlight.

01:16:17.347 --> 01:16:19.179
Why are you doing this?

01:16:19.181 --> 01:16:20.947
You're too good a lawyer.

01:16:20.949 --> 01:16:24.019
You were persuading people who wanted
the train to change their minds.

01:16:25.487 --> 01:16:28.089
Come on.
You got some paperwork to sign.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.560
Out.

01:16:32.361 --> 01:16:34.595
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:16:39.935 --> 01:16:42.503
- Let's go.
- Nate.

01:16:42.505 --> 01:16:44.071
Thank God.

01:16:44.073 --> 01:16:45.874
"Thank God." That's funny.

01:16:47.543 --> 01:16:49.242
Ow. Wait.

01:16:49.244 --> 01:16:50.677
You're a part of this?

01:16:50.679 --> 01:16:53.782
Part of it?
He's the one who brought me into it.

01:16:56.852 --> 01:16:59.019
You were best man
at my wedding.

01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.955
You were a pallbearer
at Catherine's funeral.

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:04.091
That guy is like my uncle.

01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:07.194
I'm sorry, Carson.
I had to.

01:17:07.196 --> 01:17:10.663
How much is the train company
paying you to deliver Twin Elms?

01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:12.832
A lot.

01:17:12.834 --> 01:17:15.536
You could have come to me
if you needed money, Nate.

01:17:15.538 --> 01:17:16.837
But I got in a hole so deep

01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:19.372
you couldn't possibly
dig me out.

01:17:19.374 --> 01:17:20.974
This was supposed to be clean.

01:17:20.976 --> 01:17:23.976
We scare Flora,
she sells, she makes bank.

01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:26.346
Town gets a new train,
I get out of debt.

01:17:26.348 --> 01:17:28.682
Everybody wins.

01:17:28.684 --> 01:17:31.118
We were fighting
to stop the train.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.521
Yeah. Hmm...
I'm pretty convincing, huh?

01:17:34.523 --> 01:17:36.689
A couple more scary nights,

01:17:36.691 --> 01:17:38.992
and Flora would have
begged to sell.

01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:40.861
And then Nancy got involved.

01:17:40.863 --> 01:17:43.031
Hey, we can't do anything.

01:17:43.865 --> 01:17:45.298
Not with them having guns.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.702
They may have guns
but we have something better.

01:17:50.105 --> 01:17:51.972
Sign the form.

01:17:51.974 --> 01:17:55.342
I've told you
very politely... No.

01:17:55.344 --> 01:17:57.243
Listen to the lady.

01:17:57.245 --> 01:17:58.744
You know,
for a guy half in the bag

01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:01.480
you sure handle stress
pretty well.

01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.218
He has a teenage daughter.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.754
Why would you
go to all this trouble

01:18:08.756 --> 01:18:10.789
for one plot of land?

01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:13.025
In going through Twin Elms,

01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:16.163
all the other property owners
would fall in line.

01:18:16.165 --> 01:18:18.164
Nobody would be able
to stop the train.

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:21.400
But there's no way I'll allow
the sale to go through, Nate.

01:18:21.402 --> 01:18:22.868
We know.

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:24.702
That's why I'm afraid
we can't let you leave.

01:18:24.704 --> 01:18:27.142
Hey. No, no, no.
Come here.

01:18:31.345 --> 01:18:33.312
We never talked about
killing anyone.

01:18:33.314 --> 01:18:34.847
I figured
you couldn't handle it.

01:18:34.849 --> 01:18:36.448
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it myself.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.285
No, no. Hey. No.

01:18:38.287 --> 01:18:41.022
None of this. No.
There's no reason to harm him.

01:18:42.857 --> 01:18:44.190
I've been
forging his signature

01:18:44.192 --> 01:18:45.558
ever since he came back
to River Heights.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.760
Look.

01:18:48.695 --> 01:18:49.862
Carson will keep
his mouth shut

01:18:49.864 --> 01:18:51.163
because he wants to live.

01:18:51.165 --> 01:18:52.264
Right?

01:18:52.266 --> 01:18:54.166
You know me
better than that, Nate.

01:18:54.168 --> 01:18:56.734
There's no way to keep these
two from talking about this.

01:18:56.736 --> 01:18:58.903
And if you think anybody's
gonna fall for your plan

01:18:58.905 --> 01:19:00.239
in framing Jeffrey Barnes,

01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:03.075
then you're even stupider
than I thought.

01:19:03.077 --> 01:19:05.778
I've survived four husbands,

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.382
to be killed
by your sorry butt.

01:19:12.819 --> 01:19:15.988
That brat found the room.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:21.826
What...

01:19:21.828 --> 01:19:26.000
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Just another normal Saturday night for me.

01:19:28.802 --> 01:19:30.436
That sounds
like the back door.

01:19:30.438 --> 01:19:32.306
I'll take care of her.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.159
Stupid son of a...

01:20:16.517 --> 01:20:17.949
Nancy, now!

01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:30.230
Help! Help me!

01:20:31.264 --> 01:20:33.266
Help!

01:20:36.802 --> 01:20:38.071
Run, Helen!

01:20:51.418 --> 01:20:53.384
Nobody move
and I won't hurt her.

01:20:53.386 --> 01:20:55.687
Let her go.
She's just a child!

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:57.789
You're not a murderer, Nate.

01:21:00.427 --> 01:21:01.828
You gonna get that?

01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:04.962
Shut up for once.
Just shut up.

01:21:04.964 --> 01:21:07.133
Please let her go!

01:21:11.504 --> 01:21:12.836
Come on.

01:21:18.345 --> 01:21:19.546
Argh!

01:21:28.755 --> 01:21:30.156
I'll untie the others!

01:21:57.483 --> 01:21:58.915
Help!

01:22:06.358 --> 01:22:09.192
Get it off me!

01:22:14.066 --> 01:22:15.833
It's okay.

01:22:15.835 --> 01:22:16.900
Get off me!

01:22:22.808 --> 01:22:24.309
Get it off me!

01:22:26.945 --> 01:22:29.146
Well, you don't
see that every day.

01:22:35.987 --> 01:22:38.188
Should've brought cover, Drew.

01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:41.126
I... I may have to
follow up with you later.

01:22:42.761 --> 01:22:44.728
Hey, Deputy, uh...

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.229
Thanks for everything.

01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:48.434
Thanks for believing in me.

01:22:49.769 --> 01:22:51.769
It's what I'm here for.

01:22:51.771 --> 01:22:53.737
Wait. Your flashlight.
Let me get it for you.

01:22:53.739 --> 01:22:55.238
You keep it.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.242
Something tells me
you're gonna need it again.

01:22:59.076 --> 01:23:00.943
Hey...

01:23:00.945 --> 01:23:02.780
No matter
what your future holds,

01:23:02.782 --> 01:23:06.249
you can always brag about the
day you turned a grown man pink.

01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:07.784
Different guy, new shade.

01:23:07.786 --> 01:23:09.753
It's not the same.
I don't do those things anymore.

01:23:09.755 --> 01:23:11.922
- Right.
- Come on.

01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:13.791
Hey, Helen, are you coming?

01:23:13.793 --> 01:23:16.059
Yeah, I figured, since...

01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:17.561
it's over, you know.

01:23:17.563 --> 01:23:19.663
Yeah, we'd all just
go back to hating you?

01:23:19.665 --> 01:23:21.731
Yeah, you're not
getting off that easy.

01:23:21.733 --> 01:23:25.234
- Besides, you still owe us a slice of traitor cake.
- Ah-ha!

01:23:25.236 --> 01:23:28.071
I... I told you
it's enemy cake.

01:23:28.073 --> 01:23:30.540
- Leave it alone.
- Well, you could just learn the word.

01:23:30.542 --> 01:23:32.509
The right word.
It'd be so much easier.

01:23:32.511 --> 01:23:34.510
It's Aunt Flora's cheesecake.

01:23:34.512 --> 01:23:37.048
I'll catch up
to you guys in a few.

01:23:43.822 --> 01:23:46.589
Bet you never thought you'd be
saving your own dad, did you?

01:23:46.591 --> 01:23:49.561
You know how many times
you saved my butt?

01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:54.365
Hey.

01:23:55.399 --> 01:23:57.766
Hey.

01:23:57.768 --> 01:24:00.705
I don't know what I'd do if
anything ever happened to you.

01:24:17.355 --> 01:24:19.288
Let me go. I wanna...
I wanna do one.

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:22.324
You do it.
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:24:22.326 --> 01:24:23.559
- That's not bad.
- I really want...

01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:26.428
What was that?
What was that?

01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:28.330
Wanted to see
what was gonna happen.

01:24:28.332 --> 01:24:29.665
You know, maybe I could

01:24:29.667 --> 01:24:31.934
get used to this
small town life after all.

01:24:31.936 --> 01:24:33.469
Oh, that reminds me.

01:24:33.471 --> 01:24:34.970
My cousin Emily is coming
home to River Heights

01:24:34.972 --> 01:24:37.105
to get married
at the Lilac Inn.

01:24:37.107 --> 01:24:38.675
And after
all we've been through,

01:24:38.677 --> 01:24:41.210
we could use a little fun in the
sun, don't you think?

01:24:41.212 --> 01:24:42.678
Of course. Yes.
Sounds good to me.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.247
Sure.
Deep lake, a dark forest,

01:24:45.249 --> 01:24:46.482
some creepy old inn.

01:24:46.484 --> 01:24:48.383
What could possibly go wrong?

01:24:48.385 --> 01:24:49.953
Yeah, all we need
is an evil twin

01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:51.787
and we'll have the makings
of an awesome new mystery.

01:24:51.789 --> 01:24:53.289
I have to get a photo with us.

01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:55.691
Come on, Nancy,
get in the picture.

01:24:55.693 --> 01:24:58.359
- Come on, Bess.
- Fine. Okay.

01:24:58.361 --> 01:25:00.798
Guys are so pretty.
One, two, three.

01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:03.734
#sleuthing.

01:25:05.102 --> 01:25:07.436
Actually,
I'm done with mysteries.

01:25:07.438 --> 01:25:10.238
Yeah, from now on,
I just wanna sit back,

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.809
talk about boys,
Instagram,

01:25:13.811 --> 01:25:15.844
you know, do my nails...

01:25:15.846 --> 01:25:16.847
- What?
- What?

01:25:19.984 --> 01:25:21.318
Just kidding.
