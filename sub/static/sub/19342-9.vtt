I could read the tape just like

49:10.083 --> 49:13.708
taking the longer view
at the moment.

49:13.708 --> 49:15.250
Good boy.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.917
We can't let
this opportunity slide by.

49:17.917 --> 49:20.917
This IPO could be the start

49:20.917 --> 49:25.750
of a billion  dollar windfall,
and it's a life-changer for him.

49:25.750 --> 49:28.125
You keep saying "we."

49:28.125 --> 49:30.083
I'm not liquid enough
to pull the trigger.

49:30.083 --> 49:31.834
I find that hard to fathom.

49:31.834 --> 49:34.667
My cash on hand happens to be

49:34.667 --> 49:37.166
tied up in an few real estate
deals right now,

49:37.166 --> 49:39.417
and it's not the right time
to sell.

49:39.417 --> 49:41.458
Huh. Let me guess.

49:41.458 --> 49:43.625
Kingsford?

49:43.625 --> 49:46.083
I think it's best
we not discuss that.

49:46.083 --> 49:49.542
With your position,
that would be unethical.

49:49.542 --> 49:53.125
But  there is a solution.

49:53.125 --> 49:55.959
The chunk of cash I need

49:55.959 --> 49:58.708
is on a statement
with your name on it.

49:58.708 --> 50:03.291
-The blind trust.
-But, uh, why tell me about it?

50:03.291 --> 50:05.291
Uh, isn't the whole point
to a blind trust that

50:05.291 --> 50:07.458
I'm not supposed to know what
you're doing with the money?

50:07.458 --> 50:09.083
No, not this time.

50:09.083 --> 50:12.500
That trust was set aside
for you and the children.

50:12.500 --> 50:15.667
But even the safest IPO

50:15.667 --> 50:18.875
has a different risk profile
than a normal investment.

50:18.875 --> 50:23.875
You have to know
before I do it.

50:23.875 --> 50:25.667
You want me to break
my public vow?

50:27.583 --> 50:29.125
The moment
that I'm transitioning

50:29.125 --> 50:31.083
into elected office?

50:31.083 --> 50:34.959
It's only damaging
if it gets out.

50:34.959 --> 50:38.333
I'll invest silently.
Your role will be hidden.

50:38.333 --> 50:40.834
We'll replace the funds as soon
as we sell some of the stock.

50:40.834 --> 50:43.458
No one's the wiser.

50:43.458 --> 50:46.291
Hmm.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.917
Well, if this is what
it takes...

50:51.917 --> 50:55.583
uh, to help you and Ira...

50:55.583 --> 50:59.083
-Does that mean...
-Yeah.

50:59.083 --> 51:01.667
Crack it open.

51:01.667 --> 51:04.083

51:04.083 --> 51:07.542

Chuck was, um...

quite surprised
to hear from you.

Hmm. I couldn't tell
when I spoke to him at work.

51:42.125 --> 51:45.458
Oh. I thought you weren't
really talking at work.

51:45.458 --> 51:50.250
I'm sure it must be hard for you
to not have access to him,

51:50.250 --> 51:52.041
but we think it's best
for everyone.

51:52.041 --> 51:54.333

Right...

51:58.041 --> 52:02.417

I set the policy.

It was the only way
I could work there.

52:03.792 --> 52:05.083
I couldn't keep seeing him.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.708
it wasn't like doctor-patient
or even athlete-coach.

Fuck this.

53:21.166 --> 53:23.208
It's a mistake.

53:23.208 --> 53:26.208
I see how we made it...

53:26.208 --> 53:28.875
because we forgot.

53:28.875 --> 53:31.417
I forgot...
where I'm from.

53:31.417 --> 53:36.041
I forgot that I don't give

Wags is about to give
his speech.

54:03.542 --> 54:06.041
I've had
quite a challenge this week

54:06.041 --> 54:11.000
to put together words,
ordinary words,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.834
to describe the most
extraordinary man I ever met.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.125
A man as steely
as a Roman centurion,

54:16.125 --> 54:21.166
cooler than Jean-Paul Belmondo.

54:21.166 --> 54:25.417
He's a jaguar shark,
an American Sniper,

54:25.417 --> 54:27.458
every decision in the space
of seven breaths.

54:27.458 --> 54:29.208
If you cross him,

54:29.208 --> 54:31.083
he'll put a fucking ding
in your universe.

54:34.875 --> 54:37.583
But these are all
exaggerations, derivative.

54:38.875 --> 54:43.291
They don't limn the truth
of an indefinable essence.

54:44.417 --> 54:48.667
They don't speak
to my real feelings.

54:48.667 --> 54:50.125
It's no exaggeration to say

54:50.125 --> 54:52.708
that Bobby Axelrod is the man
who gave me my life,

54:52.708 --> 54:55.250
or at least let me keep it.

54:55.250 --> 55:00.125
But even more than that,
he's given me friendship...

55:00.125 --> 55:01.291
the kind of friendship,
it's more than money,

55:01.291 --> 55:05.917
it's more than talent, it's...

55:05.917 --> 55:07.792
...almost family.

55:07.792 --> 55:11.291
But unlike family,
he never turns away.

55:11.291 --> 55:14.750
He's the only one who truly
sees me and doesn't judge.

55:16.834 --> 55:20.625
He accepts me as I am,

55:20.625 --> 55:23.458
and that kind
of friendship is...

55:23.458 --> 55:27.458
everything.

55:27.458 --> 55:29.792
It is the stuff of life itself.

55:32.875 --> 55:35.000
So thank you...

55:35.000 --> 55:36.875
for my life.

Who does that,
skips his own party?

56:00.166 --> 56:02.291
That's fucking fantastic.

56:02.291 --> 56:03.166
Maybe he's an introvert, too.

56:03.166 --> 56:06.000
No, he's not an introvert.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.792
He just remembered
he's an outlaw.

56:08.792 --> 56:11.417
