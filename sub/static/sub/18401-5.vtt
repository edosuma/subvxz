08:57.101 --> 08:58.581
It's Jennifer Lawrence."

08:58.625 --> 09:00.278
"Hi, Officer Tolbeck.

09:00.322 --> 09:01.584
"It's me, Jennifer Lawrence.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.673
What do you guys want
to talk about?"

09:03.717 --> 09:06.023
So, are you at
a dinner party?
Yes.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.548
Why do you say "over
there" when you talked
about Jennifer Lawrence?

09:08.591 --> 09:10.985
As if she just walked
through the door.Oh, I see.

09:11.028 --> 09:15.380
Oprah. I'm telling you,
she and I have something
very much in common,

09:15.424 --> 09:18.645
which is we don't have that part
of the cortex in the brain

09:18.688 --> 09:21.169
that creates personality.That actually
does feel right.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.127
Mm-hmm.
Now that you
mention it.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.389
You know what?
I have to send you that article.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.652
Mm-hmm.I mean...

09:25.695 --> 09:26.870
[à la Oprah]:
I have to send you that...

09:26.914 --> 09:29.525
♪ Article! Okay.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.961
Send me the article.
I'll read it.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.137
[ringtone playing]Oops.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.878
Oh, I got to take this.Take it in here.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.663
Tolbeck, take it
in here. It's fine.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.316
What's with all
the secret calls?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.622
I got to go. You mind?

09:39.666 --> 09:42.712
You know, secrets
metastasize.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.062
MARCO: You know what I hate?
When people ask you to use

09:45.106 --> 09:46.977
a coaster on, like,
some bullshit table

09:47.021 --> 09:48.588
that's not even that nice.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.894
Yeah, I know. Exactly. It's,
like, why are you protecting

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
random surfaces,
you fucking garbage person?

09:53.114 --> 09:54.202
You're worthless.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.596
I love boobs.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.553
Oh, you're fun.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.554
You're very fun.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.339
I like talking to you.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.514
#MeToo.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.822
I think I had a dream
about you last night.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.084
#TimesUp. Share that dream.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.912
You were drowning in the ocean,

10:08.956 --> 10:11.436
and I was trying to save you
from inside the kayak

10:11.480 --> 10:13.264
with these big, giant,
like, arms,

10:13.308 --> 10:16.398
but the arms were kind of
like wooden oars.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.095
Does that make sense?

10:18.139 --> 10:20.924
I dreamt that we shaved
your beard, and underneath,

10:20.968 --> 10:24.232
there was nothing but open sores
all over your face,

10:24.275 --> 10:25.712
and then I pulled down
your pants,

10:25.755 --> 10:27.061
and where your dick usually is,

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
there was just
a giant, laughing clown.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.412
[chuckles]:
Well... I'll be honest,

10:30.455 --> 10:31.848
I haven't shaved in a long time,

10:31.892 --> 10:33.110
so who knows what's in there.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.112
You know? Could be...

10:35.156 --> 10:37.941
a bunch of live sores, I guess.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.769
But who cares? Right?

10:39.813 --> 10:41.902
We're all gonna be dead anyway.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.078
You know, the sun is gonna
completely engulf the Earth

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
and burn everything up, right?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.648
Any Dave Matthews Band song
that you love is gone.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.737
[whispers]:
God, I love how stupid you are.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.043
Everything will be gone.
I mean, the last person

10:53.087 --> 10:55.306
who knows Shakespeare
will be dead.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.569
I hate Shakespeare.Why are we
still doing his plays?

10:57.613 --> 10:59.310
You know what
we should be doing?

10:59.354 --> 11:00.921
The plays of Stephen King.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.662
He is easily

11:02.705 --> 11:04.141
the Shakespeare of our time,

11:04.185 --> 11:06.317
if not better
than Shakespeare, actually.

11:06.361 --> 11:09.407
This was... this was fun.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.540
It was fun.
I'm glad you think so, too.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.542
Daddy's got to go to work now.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.674
You know?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.327
He can't afford to be late.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.068
Can't afford to lose
that health insurance.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.984
Daddy's diabetes has been
flaring up again, you know.

11:21.028 --> 11:24.901
Well, I... I guess I didn't
realize Daddy haddiabetes.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.990
That's got to be hard.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.992
They keep cutting off pieces
of Daddy's foot.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.864
Soon he's only gonna
have wheels for feet.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
But he'll still be able
to zoom around

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
with his little baby girl.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.825
[whispers]:
God, you make me proud.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.522
Okay, I have to go now.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.567
Uh... oh.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.003
Bye.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.397
[chuckles]

11:42.440 --> 11:44.007
Okay.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.922
All right, that went good.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.532
Hey, Steve.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.840
You ever dated a
straight-up freak?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.886
Mm-hmm.Yeah! I bet you did.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.931
[chuckles]
You're a legend.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.285
ZACH:
Car 42, maintain position.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.765
Over and out.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.462
I am nailing this job.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.464
This job is easy.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.032
Fatima, I thought
of an icebreaker question.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.251
Cool.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.253
Fatima,
icebreaker question.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.910
How do you feel about your life?

12:17.998 --> 12:19.956
Um...

12:20.000 --> 12:22.176
You don't love your life?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.265
Tell me why. Tell me
everything that's wrong with it.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.440
Get it out.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.138
Um, well...

12:28.182 --> 12:30.010
I have these
upstairs neighbors,

12:30.053 --> 12:32.969
these college
kids, that blast

12:33.013 --> 12:35.406
the worst music
all day and night.[groans]

12:35.450 --> 12:38.105
Yeah.
Yeah. And you said
they live aboveyou?

12:38.148 --> 12:39.759
Yeah.
Got it.

12:42.674 --> 12:45.112
Wha... Are you gonna...

12:45.155 --> 12:48.550
I mean, are you gonna
do something with
this information?

12:48.593 --> 12:50.857
What? No.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.599
Why are you smiling like that?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.297
Am I? I'll stop.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.648
I don't know...
Please don't do anything.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.216
I don't know if you
are, but just forget

13:02.259 --> 13:03.739
I said anything.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.785
I'm just making
conversation.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.743
Okay.We're good.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
Yeah. Okay.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.138
Great. I'm gonna take
my lunch break now.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.141
Okay. Well, now?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.925
It's not for
a few hours.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.275
That's what they
would love us to think.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.668
I was very rude.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.278
Do you have
any questions for me?

13:21.322 --> 13:23.454
I am an open book.Yeah, okay.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.500
Why did you get
into Scientology?

13:25.543 --> 13:28.633
Don't... everask me that
again.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.462
You cannot ask that.
I cannot answer that.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.117
You cannot ask that.
No one can ask that.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.293
Never, ever ask me that again

13:36.337 --> 13:37.860
in your life.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.819
I'm kidding.
But I can't answer that.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.124
Any other questions?

13:41.168 --> 13:41.995
Nope.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.258
Lunchtime it is.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.260
Cool.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.610
Well, you're never gonna
get there at that pace.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.482
Yeah. I'll pick up the pace,
if that's what you want.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.571
Don't come back!

13:55.008 --> 13:56.357
Okay.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.402
Yeah. Yeah.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.546
Don't open that!

14:13.200 --> 14:14.810
What the fuck?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.812
Silk boxers?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.640
Oh, my God, what...

14:18.683 --> 14:20.468
$86 a pair?!

14:20.511 --> 14:22.252
Yeah.How many are here?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.907
Seven. Seven pairs.
They're days-of-the-week boxers.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.561
It was a gift for you.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.345
Really. I wanted
to get this for you,

14:28.389 --> 14:30.870
because I was hoping
that it would ease the blow.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.610
"Ease the blow"?

14:32.654 --> 14:35.135
I don't want your dirty,
filthy boxers on my junk.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.745
What is going
on with you?

14:36.788 --> 14:38.399
The French cuffs.
The new shoes.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.096
The suit. The cigars.
The hair dryer.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.881
The secret phone calls.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.144
Okay, look, I can explain
all of that, okay?

14:44.187 --> 14:46.755
Oh, yeah, okay,
well, I'm all ears.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.889
Don't look at me, okay?
Can you just look out
the window, look away?
Okay.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.629
Yeah. Let's do that.[sighs]

14:51.673 --> 14:55.242
This is not easy
to tell you, but...
[breathes deeply]

14:55.285 --> 14:58.332
you remember
three months ago,
after the raid?

14:58.375 --> 15:01.161
You remember the raid, right?Yeah, I remember
the raid.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.946
Well, after I got home
that evening,

15:03.990 --> 15:06.949
Lisa asked me for a divorce.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.386
The phone calls are
to my divorce attorney.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.128
Great. And?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.522
That's it.That's it?

15:14.565 --> 15:16.916
No, that's not it.
That is not it.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.918
Because the "it" is
that you're dirty!

15:18.961 --> 15:20.658
You're part of
Haldeman's dirty ring.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.660
You're a dirty little
piggy. I know that.

15:22.704 --> 15:25.359
And you're the worst
kind of dirty-- you're
the kind of dirty

15:25.402 --> 15:26.751
that doesn't
include his partner.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
What are you talking about?Oh, come on!

15:28.971 --> 15:32.888
Leon told me everything.
I know the softball team
is dirty. I know it all.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.238
The team is dirty?Oh, don't play
dumb, Tolbeck.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.240
I know everything.
It's obvious. You're busted.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.416
I'm busting you.
This is me busting you.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.244
And what about
your, uh...

15:41.288 --> 15:43.420
oh, what about
your second phone?

15:43.464 --> 15:46.902
Yeah, that's right.
I found that.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.905
Okay, look, I'm not
proud of this, okay?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.255
Mm-hmm.Do you remember Kyle?

15:52.299 --> 15:53.953
Kyle?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.693
Your wife's lover, Kyle?

15:55.737 --> 15:57.086
Yes.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.219
Well, we're all
on the family plan together,

15:59.262 --> 16:00.698
and I bought the extra phone,

16:00.742 --> 16:02.962
because I wanted
to run down our data,

16:03.005 --> 16:05.007
especially Kyle's data.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.009
You bought
another phone...Mm-hmm.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.272
so Kyle has less data?Yeah.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.666
I mean, I know
we all suffer, but...

16:11.709 --> 16:15.670
you know, he's the only gamer,
so he suffers a little bit more.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.020
But that doesn't explain
why you're throwing
your money around

16:18.064 --> 16:19.500
like you're, like
you're staying

16:19.543 --> 16:21.371
in Richard Gere's hotel
room for the week.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.287
Look, so that Lisa
can't spend it, okay?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.289
When her attorney
gets done with me,

16:26.333 --> 16:27.899
she gets half of everything.

16:27.943 --> 16:31.164
And so I figure,
half of nothing is nothing.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.386
So you believed Leon?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.475
You thought that I was dirty?

16:38.519 --> 16:41.130
Well, n-no. No, not
really. I mean...

16:41.174 --> 16:44.394
Wow...No...

16:44.438 --> 16:46.657
Don't look like that.

16:46.701 --> 16:47.832
It was... I'm...

16:47.876 --> 16:50.313
hey, hey, I was
trying not to.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.054
Wow.
And he's really...
Please, Tolbeck,

16:52.098 --> 16:54.056
don't shake your
head like that.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.016
He's really scary, and it
was, it was so hot in there.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.321
I'm so sorry.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.019
Of course you're
not dirty.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.759
I'm an idiot. Please?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.587
Please? I'm sorry.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.763
Tolbeck, don't...
Please look at me again.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.852
Please? The way
you used to?
No.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.420
FRANKIE: I wish
I could kiss the living shit

17:10.464 --> 17:11.900
out of your face right now.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.510
[chuckles]:
Oh. Wow. Really? Yeah.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.208
I wish I could...

17:15.251 --> 17:17.384
kiss you, too.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.212
Talk dirty to me.MARCO:
How dirty?

17:19.255 --> 17:20.517
I want you to talk

17:20.561 --> 17:21.692
so fucking dirty to me,

17:21.736 --> 17:23.042
you give me an ear infection.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.565
[chuckles]

17:24.608 --> 17:26.610
Sorry, I didn't think it
was gonna get this dirty.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.177
It's fine.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.049
You want to know
what I'm wearing?Yeah.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.876
Tight blue jeans and a black
shirt. What are you wearing?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.313
I'm wearing, like, you know,

17:33.356 --> 17:35.271
you know, dark jeans and
a... and a black shirt

17:35.315 --> 17:37.708
and, like, a... like, a
collared shirt over it.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.232
It-It's a pretty good look.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.755
I want to unzip those jeans,

17:40.798 --> 17:43.714
and I want to soap up
that big-ass penis.

17:43.758 --> 17:46.891
Oh, okay. Well, you know,
just be careful, I guess.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.938
I will be,
but you know who won't be?Who?

17:49.981 --> 17:52.245
Daddy.Oh, boy.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.377
Hey, you think Daddy
should get a little undressed?

17:54.421 --> 17:58.338
Uh... yeah, yeah, sure.

17:58.381 --> 18:01.254
Well, now Daddy's unbuttoning
her top button.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.345
Your shirt has buttons?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.260
Yeah.Are you sure?

18:07.303 --> 18:08.565
Yes, I'm sure.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
And now the second button.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.700
And now all of the buttons.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.137
Uh-oh.She's not doing any of this.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
Yes, uh-oh.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.140
Now Daddy's shirt is off.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.012
What about you? You holding it?MARCO:
Oh.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.278
Y-Yeah, yeah.
No, it's-it's out.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.932
I'm-I'm holding it. It's-it's
flopping all over the place.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.804
Don't worry about it. I-I'm
just... I'm not doing anything.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.632
Uh-oh.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.373
Now your big, strong,
stoic father

18:33.416 --> 18:35.157
is cupping her ass
with both hands.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.941
What does my baby girl think
of that?

18:36.985 --> 18:37.942
Wait a minute, what?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.596
What?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.163
Wait, are you really doing this?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.947
Why are you
fucking interrogating me?

18:42.991 --> 18:44.775
It just doesn't sound
like you're actually doing

18:44.819 --> 18:46.473
any of the stuff
you're saying you're doing.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.605
I mean,
I don't fucking know, Marco.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.259
I mean, like, I'm at work.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.653
You know, my fingers
are touching dirty-ass money.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.395
I don't want to put
those fingers inside me.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.787
Well, no, you shouldn't.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.572
Wait, was there any question

18:58.615 --> 19:01.009
that you were gonna put money
inside of you during this?

19:01.052 --> 19:03.577
All money has traces
of urine on it, so, you know...MARCO: Oh, no.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.448
It's so much worse than that.
You know, they've tested

19:05.492 --> 19:07.102
every single piece of currency

19:07.146 --> 19:08.712
that's come
through the Treasury,

19:08.756 --> 19:12.063
and almost all of it
has human fecal matter on it?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.978
You told me that.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.459
It's silly. We could have
just spent this time talking.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.896
I know, but... I just wanted

19:18.940 --> 19:21.421
to, like, keep that other stuff
alive, you know?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.423
Yeah, but if I'm being honest...

19:23.466 --> 19:25.947
you know, this is the kind
of stuff that I really like.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.470
What, talking
like a little bitch?

19:27.514 --> 19:29.994
Connecting, talking,
being honest with each other.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.214
Okay. Yeah, me, too.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.521
I mean, like, yeah,
I-I kind of loved

19:34.564 --> 19:36.479
that you called me on my shit.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.221
[chuckles]:
It-it was hot. So sue me.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.354
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're really hot.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.138
And full of shit.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.358
Oh, fuck. Now I'm touching
my nipple. Shit.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.317
Wait. Really?

19:48.361 --> 19:51.712
Whoa. Uh...

19:51.755 --> 19:54.149
uh...

19:54.193 --> 19:57.021
okay, okay, okay.
Give me a second.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.589
Hey, hey. Get the
fuck out of here.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.113
Get out of here. Give
me, like, five minutes.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.376
Give me, like, seven minutes.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.125
CULLEN:
Come on, man. Please?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.302
Tolbeck. Hey, buddy?
You're my buddy.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.564
You're getting a divorce?

20:17.607 --> 20:19.218
That's terrible.
What happened?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.263
I'm all ears.
I'm-I'm here for you.[sighs]

20:21.307 --> 20:25.267
Lisa and Kyle wanted
to close up the open marriage.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.790
Oh, buddy, I'm sorry.Okay?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.270
They really want
to be together,

20:28.314 --> 20:30.272
and I don't want
to get in their way.No.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.100
I should be furious, right?Right.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.493
But I'm not.No.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.669
I'm just happy
for 'em, you know?Yeah.

20:35.712 --> 20:39.063
You should see 'em together.
They're-they're really cute.Are they?

20:39.107 --> 20:41.152
Yeah.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.067
I'm... Buddy, I'm just sorry

20:43.111 --> 20:46.070
you-you didn't think you could
talk to me about this before.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.507
[sighs] Honestly, I di...

20:47.550 --> 20:49.335
I didn't want you
to blame yourself.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.815
Why would I blame myself?

20:51.859 --> 20:54.383
I know how you look up
to me and Lisa

20:54.427 --> 20:56.298
when it comes to marriage
and everything.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.473
Are you drunk?

20:57.517 --> 20:59.170
[sighs] You put us
on a pedestal,

20:59.214 --> 21:00.607
and I just didn't
want you to think

21:00.650 --> 21:02.913
that any of this
was your fault.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.742
'Cause it's not.I know it's not.

21:05.786 --> 21:09.137
Cullen, it's not your fault.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.226
The more you say
it's not my fault,

21:11.270 --> 21:14.098
I feel like maybe you think
it is a little bit my fault.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.753
It is your fault.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.973
Well, what's with all the
"it's not your fault"?

21:19.016 --> 21:20.453
I just don't want you
to think it's your fault.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.802
How is it my fault?

21:21.845 --> 21:24.108
Because you put us up
on a pedestal,

21:24.152 --> 21:27.634
and I can't live
under that pressure

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
of being perfect all the time.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.941
Uh-huh.And so,

21:30.985 --> 21:33.335
because of the pressure
you put on me,

21:33.379 --> 21:35.729
it caused our marriage
to fall apart.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.339
I see.

21:37.383 --> 21:40.951
But don't let that be
on your head.

21:40.995 --> 21:41.952
Okay?Okay.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.345
It's not your fault.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.391
Thanks.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.915
And I apologize for
the part I played

21:47.958 --> 21:49.395
in the breakdown
of your marriage.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.918
Finally.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.311
Huh?Hmm?

21:52.354 --> 21:53.312
What?

21:53.355 --> 21:54.965
I was just... Saw a rat.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.669
Yeah, um, thank you
for letting me know.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.498
Yeah.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.282
I am so sorry.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.892
I know I'm a few minutes late.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.025
I did not intend to be
one second longer than an hour,

22:11.068 --> 22:14.202
but I wound up behind
this motorcycle that spun out.

22:14.245 --> 22:16.204
Waited for the paramedics
to come,

22:16.247 --> 22:18.119
and now it has caused me
to be...

22:18.162 --> 22:20.861
I'm, like, three minutes late.
And I know that's not okay.Yeah.

22:20.904 --> 22:23.080
I understand that's not okay.Um, Zach.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.779
Uh, that was my
landlord on the phone.

22:25.822 --> 22:30.044
He just told me that, uh, my
frat cock neighbors upstairs

22:30.087 --> 22:32.525
just decided to move out.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.875
Wow.It's a real wowie.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.398
Uh-huh.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.052
It's because of a death threat?

22:38.095 --> 22:42.056
A very graphic death threat
is what he said, actually.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.624
It was placed under a
tub of animal blood?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.626
Yeah.Wow.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.715
Just ever so subtly.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.934
Would you know anything
about that?

22:52.022 --> 22:54.242
No.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.765
Not at all.

22:55.809 --> 22:59.639
It sounds
like a real crazy person did it.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.162
Sounds like whoever
did that probably had

23:01.205 --> 23:03.730
a real righteous cause
that they believed in, though.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.253
Probably they were inspired
to do it

23:05.296 --> 23:06.733
by someone who they find

23:06.776 --> 23:08.474
really inspiring.

23:08.517 --> 23:11.128
Did the landlord
call you personally?

23:11.172 --> 23:12.347
Yeah.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.001
[scoffs]

23:14.044 --> 23:17.047
He was told not to do that,
I would imagine.

23:17.091 --> 23:20.050
And now he will pay,
I am certain.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.443
No. No.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.098
You can't terrorize people
on my behalf.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.926
That's insane.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.711
Okay, fine. Moving forward,

23:28.755 --> 23:31.322
I promise I will not terrorize
anyone on your behalf,

23:31.366 --> 23:33.194
unless, of course, I sense
that that is what you want

23:33.237 --> 23:35.196
despite what you say.No.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.329
I'm-I'm saying
please do not do that.

23:38.373 --> 23:42.638
I cannot believe you would do
those things for me.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.336
Because in the short time
that we've known each other,

23:45.380 --> 23:46.947
I've gotten a sense
of your morals and values,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.644
and I believe
that they're really on point,

23:48.688 --> 23:50.733
and I want to support them,
and I want to support you.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.083
Oh.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.825
You really would do
anything for me, huh?

23:55.869 --> 23:57.827
Anything short of murder.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.528
TOLBECK: Oh, boy, it feels
so good not to lie to you

24:02.571 --> 24:05.139
about my divorce anymore. CULLEN:
Oh, my God, yes.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.620
[laughs] I got to tell you,
I was really nervous, man.Really?

24:07.663 --> 24:10.187
I had this whole elaborate plan
on how to break it to you.Oh.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.363
So, I figured we would
go out for ice cream.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.975
You know?Yeah. What else?

24:15.018 --> 24:16.585
That's it.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.761
Oh, just ice cream?'Cause I thought
that'd be a better way

24:18.805 --> 24:21.329
to break the news to you.Man, I'm relieved. I was...

24:21.372 --> 24:22.852
I was certain I was gonna
have to turn you in.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.114
No!I know.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.812
[exhales]Believe that shit?

24:25.855 --> 24:28.510
That's crazy.I know, man. I know.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.295
I feel free, man.
I feel lighter, you know?

24:31.339 --> 24:32.949
I feel like I could fly.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.995
You think Oprah feels
like she wants to fly?

24:35.038 --> 24:38.477
[à la Oprah]:
I think I could fly!Fly!

24:38.520 --> 24:40.479
Pretty good. Hey,
give me a hug, buddy.Yeah.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.524
All right, hug.I'm sorry I doubted you.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.484
Aw, you're so sweet.I'm sorry I doubted you.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.181
That's...

24:47.224 --> 24:49.400
Mm.And that bag is
another thing. I was...

24:49.444 --> 24:51.228
I was convinced after
Leon got in my ear.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.795
[chuckles]:
I thought that...

24:52.839 --> 24:54.884
that you were laundering
dirty money with that bag.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.538
[laughs]Like Al Capone or something.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.192
That is ridiculous.Oh, my God.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.542
I was just...Dirty money in a laundry bag.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.848
I know. I know, I'm sorry.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.850
[chuckles]
That is funny, though.Yeah.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.069
Yeah.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.898
Shoot, I never
even looked in that bag.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.908
What?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.565
I'm gonna open it.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.088
Okay.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.612
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:26.655 --> 25:27.743
Let's not even open it.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.397
[sighs]

25:29.440 --> 25:30.746
Maybe it's better we don't know.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.009
I'm opening the bag.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.185
Ready? One, two,

25:35.229 --> 25:37.318
three. Oh, fuck.Wait, wait, wait.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.276
Do you want to open it?

25:39.320 --> 25:41.583
No, you do it. Go ahead, you're
right. You do it. You do it.Okay.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.281
Three, two, one.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.982
MAN:
Guh-doosh.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.985
