01:17.235 --> 01:19.529
So, on a scale of one to ten,

01:19.654 --> 01:24.158
ten being the strongest,
how are we doing on the nausea?

01:24.284 --> 01:27.453
I'd say about... about an eleven.

01:27.578 --> 01:29.122
You have
any ringing in your ears?

01:29.247 --> 01:31.124
Hm?

01:31.249 --> 01:33.918
Any ringing or...
or buzzing of the ears?

01:36.004 --> 01:39.007
You sound like you're underwater.

01:40.425 --> 01:44.846
And any tingling sensations
in your fingertips or toes?

01:47.265 --> 01:48.850
In my mouth.

01:48.975 --> 01:52.812
- You have tingling in your mouth?
- In my mouth.

01:52.937 --> 01:55.440
Interesting.
You mind if I take a peek?

02:43.571 --> 02:45.448
I bet you two wish
you were in Group A, huh?

03:02.590 --> 03:04.425
Sorry it didn't work out.

03:06.344 --> 03:08.054
You said $1,750.

03:08.179 --> 03:11.307
It's $1,750 if you do all eight days.

03:11.432 --> 03:14.936
- It's a new policy.
- New policy? Since when?

03:15.061 --> 03:17.188
I was countin' on that scratch, man.

03:17.313 --> 03:19.524
Sorry, kid. They're shaking things up
in Carpetland again.

03:19.649 --> 03:21.192
The whole department's
getting the squeeze.

03:21.317 --> 03:22.777
It's not like the glory days at CLR.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.612
You know what?
Fuck Naltech!

03:24.737 --> 03:26.823
Fuck this office!
Fuck you!

03:37.667 --> 03:38.960
Fuck!

03:50.263 --> 03:52.223
You got a smoke?

03:52.348 --> 03:53.850
Yeah, sure.

03:57.019 --> 04:00.064
I guess we both
got the boot, huh?

04:05.403 --> 04:08.239
I've been waiting 30 minutes
for the 151.

04:08.364 --> 04:10.324
Fuckin' blows.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.161
151 doesn't run on Sundays.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.329
It's Sunday?

04:27.258 --> 04:29.719
You wanna come home with me?

04:29.844 --> 04:32.847
You know, Sunday dinner.
Mom always goes big.

04:34.348 --> 04:36.767
I'll blow you too.
After dinner.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.529
Please don't look at me.

05:30.905 --> 05:32.406
I'm not.

05:34.033 --> 05:38.204
Oh, Jesus Christ.
This sucks.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.165
What's wrong with your hair?

05:42.416 --> 05:44.043
What do you mean?

05:44.168 --> 05:46.462
It's all shaved and stuff.

05:46.587 --> 05:49.799
Hm.
Don't worry about it.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.135
I like his hair.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.516
What?

05:58.641 --> 06:00.309
I do.

06:09.443 --> 06:11.988
What's your name again?

06:12.113 --> 06:15.074
Bill.

06:15.199 --> 06:16.617
Do you hate me, Bill?

06:19.829 --> 06:21.247
Nope.

06:23.874 --> 06:24.875
Good.

06:28.337 --> 06:30.881
Oh, no. Come on.
No, no!

06:31.007 --> 06:32.008
No, no! Fuck!

06:32.133 --> 06:34.427
Hit him!
Hit him!

06:34.552 --> 06:35.636
Stomp him!

06:35.761 --> 06:37.054
Come on!

06:37.179 --> 06:38.723
Oh, that's lousy!

06:38.848 --> 06:40.933
Every year, man.
I'm tellin' you...

06:41.058 --> 06:43.519
I'm gonna go downstairs
and shower in a few minutes.

06:43.644 --> 06:44.687
Why don't you come meet me?

06:44.812 --> 06:48.190
It's fuckin' impossible.
It's impossible.

06:48.316 --> 06:51.027
Do you like football?

06:51.152 --> 06:52.987
- They don't draft well.
- No.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.866
Can't play defense,
they don't draft, they don't ski.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.290
Run!

07:04.415 --> 07:07.168
- Run, you nigger!
- Run!

07:07.293 --> 07:08.961
- Go, go, go!
- Run, yeah!

07:10.838 --> 07:12.298
- There it is!
- Woohoo!

07:42.286 --> 07:44.413
Ah!
That was awesome.

07:44.538 --> 07:46.999
Did you see that shit?

07:47.124 --> 07:49.752
That was awesome!

07:49.877 --> 07:52.546
So you really like my hair?

07:54.298 --> 07:57.134
Or are you just making conversation?

07:57.259 --> 07:58.260
Oh, yeah!

08:08.437 --> 08:11.732
Come on.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.584
He was taking advantage of me.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.380
She's tellin' stories, Bill.

09:16.505 --> 09:17.631
That's the sauce talkin'.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.593
Get the fuck out
of my house, pervert.

09:21.051 --> 09:22.386
Get out!

09:22.511 --> 09:24.263
Oh, I'll kill him, Daddy.

09:24.388 --> 09:25.556
Get him!

Where you gonna go,
motherfucker?

09:34.648 --> 09:36.233
You little pervert punk!

09:36.358 --> 09:39.361
Come at me,
you fuckin' cocksucker!

09:39.487 --> 09:40.905
Oh, shit!

09:44.617 --> 09:48.621
No! My window!
You asshole!

09:49.580 --> 09:51.499
You smashed my bay window!

09:51.624 --> 09:53.459
He smashed our bay window!

09:53.584 --> 09:54.585
Let's get him.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.212
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now watch the glass, Bobber.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.218
Call the cops!

10:06.180 --> 10:08.516
Go on, call the cops!

10:51.350 --> 10:53.602
Oh, crud.

11:01.735 --> 11:04.029
Nice save, cum-catcher.

11:04.154 --> 11:06.365
Yeah, too bad Coach doesn't
have a bukkake team, retard,

11:06.490 --> 11:08.117
you could probably get a full-ride.

11:08.242 --> 11:10.244
Yeah, you could major in suckin' dick.

11:13.038 --> 11:16.000
No, leave it!
It's a good look for you.

11:16.125 --> 11:19.545
Yeah, it gets me hard.
All that goo everywhere.

11:21.088 --> 11:24.800
Are you gonna eat that?
Cos my dick is starving.

11:24.925 --> 11:27.052
He didn't get enough calories
at breakfast this morning.

11:38.981 --> 11:40.065
Ah, fuck!

11:41.984 --> 11:44.361
Where'd you get this dumb
fuckin' sandwich, retard?

11:44.486 --> 11:45.779
You know it's a loser-ass sandwich, D.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.866
There's just plain white paper
on the motherfucker.

11:48.991 --> 11:52.119
Dude, tell me I didn't get some
of this shit on my tracksuit.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.913
Oh, Coach would kill you, Derrick.

11:58.751 --> 12:02.963
I swear to God,
if any of this toxic waste

12:03.088 --> 12:04.798
gets on my tracksuit,

12:04.924 --> 12:06.842
I'm gonna track down
the Mexican who made it

12:06.967 --> 12:08.427
and fucking kill his family!

12:10.638 --> 12:12.306
God, fuck!

12:13.349 --> 12:15.017
Let's fucking go.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.193
Goddamn it!

12:24.318 --> 12:25.945
One of these motherfuckers
shit all over the bedding.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.863
Now they're all covered.

12:27.988 --> 12:29.531
Patty!

12:29.657 --> 12:31.200
Yes, Mr. Hanley?

12:31.325 --> 12:33.452
Get a rag and some soapy water
and clean this up.

12:33.577 --> 12:35.037
These fuckers gotta be
show quality

12:35.162 --> 12:37.373
if we're gonna move 'em up
to the front window.

12:37.498 --> 12:39.541
Like, hand soap
from the bathroom?

12:39.667 --> 12:42.378
No, get some fuckin' shampoo!
We need 'em to shine!

12:44.630 --> 12:46.048
Come on, move your ass!

13:23.002 --> 13:26.422
I'm gonna fuck you so hard
when we get back to Brando's.

13:26.547 --> 13:27.881
Hey, look!
I think retard's jealous!

13:29.967 --> 13:31.677
What are you looking at,
you fucking dog?

14:33.864 --> 14:37.826
Oh, boy. That ground chuck
has a real kick to it.

14:37.951 --> 14:39.661
Did you do something
different tonight?

14:39.787 --> 14:42.122
- Take a sip of water, Norm.
- Oh.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.965
Ahh.

14:52.091 --> 14:54.843
That's a-spicy.

14:54.968 --> 14:56.678
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.765
You didn't spice it up
a little bit?

14:59.890 --> 15:01.100
It's just a little cumin.

15:01.225 --> 15:04.103
No more than the recipe
calls for.

15:04.228 --> 15:06.480
Mom, what's cumin again?

15:06.605 --> 15:08.065
Honey, let's not do this tonight.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.234
Just eat your salad, please.

15:10.359 --> 15:14.029
- Hey, um... shells are edible.
- Mm.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.990
Anybody tried their shell yet?

15:17.116 --> 15:20.536
And why are you not eating?

15:20.661 --> 15:24.373
- Something happen at school?
- Mom, why are you doing this?

15:24.498 --> 15:26.500
Why are you trying to pry, OK?

15:26.625 --> 15:27.960
It's, like, pry, pry, pry with you.

15:28.085 --> 15:31.338
No one's prying, Kev. Your mom
just asked you a question.

15:31.463 --> 15:32.589
You need to take it down
a notch.

15:33.215 --> 15:34.508
You are spazzing.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.594
- Dad!
- Patty, cool it.

15:39.596 --> 15:41.640
- So, how was school today?
- Oh, my God.

15:41.765 --> 15:43.475
Is it always gonna be
an inquisition?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.977
What did you do today?
Hmm?

15:45.102 --> 15:46.186
You better tame that tone, mister.

15:46.311 --> 15:48.188
I'm done.
May I be excused, please?

15:48.313 --> 15:50.399
No, you may not.
You're gonna sit there with all of us,

15:50.524 --> 15:52.317
eat your taco salad
and have dessert.

15:52.442 --> 15:54.862
I got a chocolate cake.

15:54.987 --> 15:58.365
Hey, Mom, can I go see a rock show
with Sissy and Karen on Friday?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.826
Sissy and Karen?
That's a blast from the past.

16:00.951 --> 16:02.286
I haven't heard you
talk about them

16:02.411 --> 16:03.620
since you dropped out
of junior college.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.205
What's the group?

16:05.330 --> 16:07.249
Oh, they're this really cool
group from New York City.

16:07.374 --> 16:10.127
They're, um...
really smart and stuff.

16:10.252 --> 16:12.504
The music is almost educational.

16:12.629 --> 16:14.131
What's the name of the group?

16:14.256 --> 16:15.883
The Alliance.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.634
Oh, I don't know.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.929
That-that sounds pretty militant.
The Alliance?

16:21.054 --> 16:23.807
I don't like the sound
of this New York militia music.

16:23.932 --> 16:26.143
Come on, I never get
to do anything fun!

16:26.268 --> 16:28.770
Hey, you need to take it down a notch.

16:28.896 --> 16:29.938
Shut the hell up, Kev!

16:30.063 --> 16:33.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch the language.

16:34.109 --> 16:38.780
All right?
Now, rock concerts are bad news.

16:38.906 --> 16:41.366
Plus, we don't want you around
all those strobe lights.

16:41.491 --> 16:42.492
That's true.

16:42.618 --> 16:44.578
There's not gonna be
any strobe lights.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.830
Hey, here's an idea.

16:46.955 --> 16:49.583
Why don't you invite Sissy
and Karen over Friday night

16:49.708 --> 16:50.667
and have a slumber party
like old times.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.252
We can play Party Farm.

16:52.377 --> 16:53.545
Dad can whip up
some homemade ice cream.

16:53.670 --> 16:54.880
Hm-hm.

16:55.005 --> 16:57.633
No one wants to play
that baby stuff anymore, Mom.

16:57.758 --> 16:58.800
I'm 20 years old.

16:58.926 --> 17:00.344
Now who's spazzing?

17:00.469 --> 17:01.678
Kevin, shut the eff up!

17:01.803 --> 17:04.056
OK, you really need
to take it down a notch.

19:11.975 --> 19:13.685
Are you trying
to buy some drugs?

19:21.777 --> 19:24.321
Damn, this white boy
all business.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.493
Yo, get away
from my fuckin' door.

19:29.618 --> 19:32.829
Hey, keep these fuckin' kids
away from my door!

19:42.214 --> 19:46.134
So my man, what you need?

19:46.259 --> 19:47.928
Freestyle it.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.604
Don't do that shit!

20:11.284 --> 20:13.453
Oh, check this shit out.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.550
Some wigger kid offloaded
all this shit on me

20:26.675 --> 20:28.635
for a pound of schwag.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.221
Any of these motherfuckers
worth anything?

20:31.346 --> 20:34.724
Yeah, this Neumann here.
You hit the jackpot.

20:34.850 --> 20:38.895
Shit, man, make me an offer.
It's priced to scoot.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.148
OK, cool.
Give me a week.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.233
I gotta dump this shit.

20:43.358 --> 20:44.985
All right.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.778
Well, shit,
you wanna stick around?

20:46.903 --> 20:50.031
- Smoke a joint?
- I can't.

20:50.157 --> 20:52.701
It fucks with my motivation.

21:32.532 --> 21:34.784
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:49.591 --> 21:51.968
I think I'm in love.

21:52.093 --> 21:55.680
Would you look at this clam?

21:57.849 --> 22:00.143
Man, I'm glad the bush
making a comeback.

22:00.268 --> 22:03.188
Shit, it's about fuckin' time.

22:03.313 --> 22:05.482
You might want
to check out page 69.

22:05.607 --> 22:08.443
I think you'll be interested
in page 13.

22:13.782 --> 22:15.825
My man.

22:15.951 --> 22:17.786
You want a hot dog?

22:20.372 --> 22:22.374
No.

22:22.499 --> 22:24.626
Let me get a... let me get
two packs of Royals.

22:24.751 --> 22:26.253
Royals?

22:30.590 --> 22:33.218
Don't sweat, man.
What the fuck I care?

22:36.638 --> 22:39.683
Man, didn't I tell you not
to fucking come in here again?

22:39.808 --> 22:40.809
Huh?

22:40.934 --> 22:42.352
Come on.
Motherfucker!

25:07.622 --> 25:10.333
You seen anyone suspicious
running around back here?

25:15.588 --> 25:17.298
You see this creep,

25:17.424 --> 25:19.843
dial the number
at the bottom of the flyer.

25:30.186 --> 25:32.522
I knew I recognized you.

25:33.940 --> 25:37.444
You were in my Music Appreciation course
at the J.C. before I quit.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.572
Yeah?

25:42.407 --> 25:44.701
Professor Babcock
threw a stapler at you.

25:48.163 --> 25:50.039
OK, yeah.

25:52.584 --> 25:56.629
Your hair was longer then.
Like this.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.762
But other than that,
you look the same.

26:05.013 --> 26:07.348
You look the same too.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.684
Thanks.

26:09.809 --> 26:12.061
It's not really a compliment.

26:17.025 --> 26:19.652
Where do you work,
the ice cream shop?

26:21.362 --> 26:22.655
I wish.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.116
The Pet Zone next door.

26:27.994 --> 26:30.413
So what are you doin' out here?
What, are you on break or somethin'?

26:33.082 --> 26:35.502
Mr. Hanley just let me go.

26:36.669 --> 26:38.963
What, like you got fired?

26:39.088 --> 26:41.132
Well, Michigan's raising
the minimum wage,

26:41.257 --> 26:44.052
so he's gonna go back to cleaning
the animal cages himself

26:44.177 --> 26:45.887
until the economy
gets back on its feet.

26:46.012 --> 26:49.098
Jesus Christ, that's what
he fuckin' told you?

26:50.058 --> 26:52.769
Uh-huh.

26:52.894 --> 26:56.397
So, I'm guessing that's not
chocolate chip on your smock.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.240
You're funny.

27:09.077 --> 27:12.330
Look, you got someplace
around here we can go?

27:16.543 --> 27:17.877
Mm.

27:39.482 --> 27:42.986
You can't smoke in here.
My dad's allergic.

27:43.111 --> 27:45.196
Fuck your dad.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.294
Is that your mom?

28:00.795 --> 28:02.171
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:02.297 --> 28:04.757
What, is she a bull dyke?

28:04.883 --> 28:08.386
- What do you mean?
- I mean, does she eat pussy?

28:09.429 --> 28:11.139
You see, the haircut
gives it away.

28:11.264 --> 28:15.101
It makes her look like
a real pro muff-diver.

28:18.271 --> 28:19.898
Is that your brother?

28:20.023 --> 28:22.734
- Yeah, that's Kevin.
- Oh.

28:22.859 --> 28:25.236
He looks like a faggot.

28:25.361 --> 28:26.905
Well, he's not homosexual.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.616
Yeah, I'm sure
he just looks queer.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.122
You the oldest?

28:37.165 --> 28:39.208
Yeah.

28:39.334 --> 28:40.877
Kevin's adopted.

28:41.002 --> 28:42.003
No shit?

28:43.463 --> 28:44.464
Imagine that.

28:44.589 --> 28:47.592
The old barren bull dyke
adopting a little fag kid

28:47.717 --> 28:51.721
just doing her part
for society and shit.

28:55.266 --> 28:56.684
Come on.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.777
You want something to drink?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.364
Sure, what do you got?

29:09.489 --> 29:13.534
Water, ice tea,
cherry juice box...

29:13.660 --> 29:16.788
That's a pretty
weak-ass selection.

29:16.913 --> 29:21.376
- How 'bout a couple of beers?
- Sorry, Dad's allergic.

29:21.501 --> 29:24.128
To cigarette smoke
and alcohol?

29:24.253 --> 29:25.713
Yeah.

29:25.838 --> 29:29.384
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
How does he cope?

29:29.509 --> 29:31.469
What do you mean?

29:31.594 --> 29:34.305
I mean, how does he cope
in this loser fuckin' family

29:34.430 --> 29:36.766
without some kind of vice?

29:40.853 --> 29:43.106
What's a vice again?

29:45.692 --> 29:47.527
You know,
I can't figure you out.

29:49.237 --> 29:54.242
You got shit for brains
and zero personality,

29:54.367 --> 29:58.079
but you lose those glasses
and that shit-peppered smock,

29:58.204 --> 30:00.289
hell, I could probably
get hard.

30:05.253 --> 30:08.673
You know I'm fuckin'
with you, right?

30:15.304 --> 30:17.140
Take off your glasses.

30:25.815 --> 30:27.650
Let your hair down.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.491
Shake it out.

30:39.537 --> 30:42.373
Now take off
that stupid fuckin' smock.

31:01.601 --> 31:03.853
Why did you bring me
to your house?

31:05.521 --> 31:07.356
I don't know.

31:07.482 --> 31:08.483
Bullshit.

31:11.277 --> 31:15.281
I think you know exactly
why you brought me here.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.953
You got a boyfriend?

31:21.079 --> 31:22.705
No.

31:22.830 --> 31:24.707
Girlfriend?

31:24.832 --> 31:26.292
No.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.628
I don't give a shit if you
suck pussy like your mom.

31:28.753 --> 31:30.797
I got a thing for dyke bitches.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.632
No, I'm not homosexual.

31:35.885 --> 31:38.971
You know I'm still
fuckin' with you, right?

31:43.601 --> 31:46.604
You need
to take it down a notch.

31:49.190 --> 31:51.818
What is that supposed to mean?

31:58.908 --> 32:03.579
Look, I owe you one.

32:05.832 --> 32:07.667
You name it.

32:09.335 --> 32:10.837
Deal?

32:18.511 --> 32:20.680
Think about it.

32:23.391 --> 32:25.601
- Patty?
- That's my mom.

32:25.726 --> 32:29.397
I could use your help
with the grocery bags, please.

32:32.441 --> 32:33.734
Oh, my.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.365
Mm.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.826
That is fuckin' delicious, Connie.
Thank you.

32:41.951 --> 32:43.119
- I was half starved.
- Dad, he just...

32:43.244 --> 32:44.829
You're gonna let him get away
with that F-bomb?

32:46.789 --> 32:49.458
- Quiet, Kev.
- Yeah. Quiet, Kev.

32:49.584 --> 32:53.588
- Shut up, retard.
- That's enough, Kevin.

32:53.713 --> 32:56.090
- What do you call this again?
- Chicken cordon bleu.

32:56.215 --> 32:57.508
It's fantastic.

32:57.633 --> 33:01.512
Well, it was frozen.
It's not like she made it herself, so...

33:01.637 --> 33:04.098
Tame that tone, Kev.
You're on thin ice!

33:04.223 --> 33:08.102
Kevin, you're at an eight,
and you need to be at about a three.

33:08.227 --> 33:09.937
I'm sorry.
He's usually not so aggressive.

33:10.062 --> 33:11.272
It's fine. It's fine.

33:11.397 --> 33:14.859
I'm just not used
to cooking of this caliber.

33:14.984 --> 33:18.571
You see, in Africa
our rations are very meager.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.157
- Africa?
- My parents are missionaries.

33:21.282 --> 33:25.161
We've, uh... spent the last three years
building churches in Tanzania.

33:25.286 --> 33:26.662
Oh, my.

33:26.787 --> 33:31.709
If you survived on a diet of ugali
and, uh, sweet potatoes for three years,

33:31.834 --> 33:35.922
you'd understand why I'm so ecstatic
about your mom's cordon bleu.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.840
- What's ugali?
- Don't worry about it.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.011
- So what's with the haircut?
- Stop prying.

33:42.136 --> 33:43.137
Stop frothing.

33:43.262 --> 33:45.223
Another word and you both
can forget about dessert.

33:45.348 --> 33:46.974
You know, there's no dessert
in Tanzania.

33:47.099 --> 33:51.979
You know, I've always dreamed
of doing missionary work.

33:52.104 --> 33:57.526
Uh... seeing the world
or really making a difference.

33:57.652 --> 34:00.154
Well, you know, nothing's,
uh... nothing's stopping you

34:00.279 --> 34:02.657
from enlisting
on Team Jesus, Norm.

34:02.782 --> 34:06.452
In fact, I'm rounding up a fresh batch
of apostles as we speak.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.329
Oh, well, uh, uh...

34:08.454 --> 34:11.916
I was thinking more down the line,
you know, after I retire.

34:13.501 --> 34:15.378
It's good to have a purpose.

34:15.503 --> 34:19.090
But if there's any
other way we can help...

34:19.215 --> 34:23.010
Actually, um... I'm in need
of a host family for the week.

34:23.135 --> 34:24.804
I beg your pardon?

34:24.929 --> 34:26.806
He's looking
for somewhere to stay, Norm.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.139
Oh!

34:28.266 --> 34:31.101
You see, when we moved to Tanzania,
my parents, they sold the house.

34:31.226 --> 34:33.688
They donated the money
to the church.

34:33.813 --> 34:37.108
Our, uh... regular
host family's out of town,

34:37.233 --> 34:40.110
so I've been sleeping
on the couch in the church

34:40.235 --> 34:41.237
for the past two nights.

34:41.362 --> 34:44.031
He can stay in Kevin's room
on the top bunk.

34:44.156 --> 34:45.366
No frickin' way!

34:45.491 --> 34:48.411
Take it down a notch, Kev.

34:48.536 --> 34:50.996
What do you think?

34:51.121 --> 34:54.708
Yeah, I have no problem with it.
I'm happy to help.

34:56.252 --> 34:58.129
This blows!
Don't get a say?

34:58.254 --> 35:00.548
What's with all the hostility, rager?

35:00.673 --> 35:02.008
I'm not "raging".

35:02.133 --> 35:03.926
I just don't want to bunk
with some creep

35:04.051 --> 35:06.220
- with a half-shaved head, OK?
- That's it. You're grounded.

35:06.345 --> 35:08.055
- Grounded?
- Grounded with no pudding.

35:08.180 --> 35:11.642
Connie, it's fine, really.

35:11.767 --> 35:13.728
- I know what's wrong with Kev.
- You do?

35:13.853 --> 35:16.439
Sure. It's obvious.

35:16.564 --> 35:19.108
Hey, new guy, do me a favor,
don't call me Kev.

35:19.233 --> 35:20.776
You've been here, like,
five minutes.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.612
Zip it, mister, right now.

35:23.738 --> 35:26.240
Look, I don't mean
to be forward, but, um...

35:26.365 --> 35:29.577
I noticed that there wasn't any
family prayer prior to the meal.

35:29.702 --> 35:30.953
Is that common?

35:31.078 --> 35:34.123
Well, yeah, I guess.

35:34.248 --> 35:37.168
OK, well, would you mind
if I, uh...

35:37.293 --> 35:41.630
led us in a, a prayer
just a, just a simple...

35:41.756 --> 35:43.299
Uh, of course not.
Thank you.

35:43.424 --> 35:45.593
- We'd be honored.
- Sure. Great.

35:45.718 --> 35:48.554
All right, everybody, grab hands.

35:49.388 --> 35:51.640
Grab hands, OK?

35:53.184 --> 35:56.354
Kevin.

35:59.774 --> 36:05.613
Dear Lord, we thank you for this bountiful
and nourishing meal on the table before us.

36:06.530 --> 36:09.575
May it strengthen and refresh
our earth bodies

36:09.700 --> 36:13.579
so that we may follow your
example for yet another day.

36:13.704 --> 36:16.665
Please bless Connie,
who has prepared this feast

36:16.791 --> 36:19.919
with loving hands,
as well as her life partner,

36:20.044 --> 36:23.422
Norman, who invites you
into his heart

36:23.547 --> 36:26.300
and hopes to one day
be called to Tanzania

36:26.425 --> 36:29.345
where he can make a difference.

36:29.470 --> 36:32.848
And please bless Patty,
whose kindness and hospitality

36:32.973 --> 36:34.767
has allowed me
into this home

36:34.892 --> 36:39.730
where I can spread your
wisdom amongst these souls.

36:39.855 --> 36:43.359
And please, bless
and watch over Kevin,

36:43.484 --> 36:45.111
who especially needs
your guidance

36:45.236 --> 36:47.738
during his rebellious years,

36:47.863 --> 36:50.991
as he continues to lash out
and alienate himself

36:51.117 --> 36:54.328
from those around him.

36:54.453 --> 36:59.166
Allow him to grow in grace
and knowledge of you,

36:59.291 --> 37:04.255
and guide him in his search
for his birth parents,

37:04.380 --> 37:07.633
who must one day hope
to see his face,

37:09.301 --> 37:12.972
just as he longs
to see theirs.

37:13.097 --> 37:16.350
- Wait, what?
- In Jesus' name, we pray.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.310
- Mom?
- Uh...

37:18.436 --> 37:20.396
Amen.

37:24.191 --> 37:26.819
Sorry my room is a pig sty.

37:26.944 --> 37:31.282
Your family gives me
a fuckin' migraine.

37:31.407 --> 37:33.451
I've never seen Kev
break down like that.

37:33.576 --> 37:34.618
I feel bad for him.

37:34.743 --> 37:36.287
Look, it's about time somebody
got straight with him.

37:36.412 --> 37:37.413
I mean, Jesus Christ.

37:37.538 --> 37:39.123
When were they gonna fuckin' tell him,
on their death beds?

37:43.627 --> 37:44.628
You want a zinger?

37:44.753 --> 37:46.464
No, thanks.
I've got my own.

37:47.423 --> 37:48.757
- Oh?
- Mm-hm.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.178
I'm on five different medications.

37:53.721 --> 37:56.432
Jesus fucking Christ.

37:56.557 --> 37:58.476
You want to listen
to some records?

38:00.311 --> 38:02.521
Knock yourself out.

38:02.646 --> 38:04.690
Thanks for including me
in your prayer.

38:04.815 --> 38:05.941
I thought that was sweet.

38:06.942 --> 38:08.611
You actually bought that shit?

38:08.736 --> 38:09.737
Bought what?

38:11.489 --> 38:13.782
That church bullshit?

38:15.409 --> 38:16.869
You mean you told a lie?

38:17.536 --> 38:18.787
Yeah.

38:20.456 --> 38:22.041
Why would you lie
about Tanzania?

38:22.166 --> 38:23.250
Fuck Tanzania.

38:24.668 --> 38:26.295
Look, I needed a place
to hole up.

38:26.420 --> 38:28.506
- Your house is perfect.
- Why is it perfect?

38:30.591 --> 38:32.551
Because nobody'll look
for me here.

38:32.676 --> 38:34.803
- Like those policemen?
- Yeah.

38:34.929 --> 38:36.805
Well, why were they
looking for you?

38:36.931 --> 38:38.974
Because I like to burn shit.

38:42.228 --> 38:46.023
You wouldn't burn
our house down, would you?

38:46.148 --> 38:47.149
No. Fuck that.

38:47.274 --> 38:49.401
Come on, I wouldn't pull
any weak shit like that.

38:52.696 --> 38:57.701
Hey, remember when you said
that you owed me one?

38:57.826 --> 39:00.454
Yeah, cos it was,
like, an hour ago.

39:00.579 --> 39:02.957
Well, I know what I want.

39:03.082 --> 39:04.124
All right, hit me.

39:04.250 --> 39:08.754
I want you to take me
to The Alliance concert on Friday night.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.006
You would.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.926
Bunch of fuckin' posers.

39:14.051 --> 39:17.012
Yeah, but PSYOPS is opening for them,
and they're my favorite band.

39:17.137 --> 39:21.267
There is no fucking way
PSYOPS would play a show

39:21.392 --> 39:22.476
with a band like The Alliance.

39:23.852 --> 39:26.105
No, it's true!

39:29.400 --> 39:31.944
Some kid was handing out flyers
downtown a few days ago.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.488
What the fuck is this?

39:37.366 --> 39:39.034
How the fuck did you know
about PSYOPS?

39:40.286 --> 39:42.705
Well, my friends Sissy and Karen
turned me onto them.

39:42.830 --> 39:44.873
I've got all their seven inches,
all their cassettes.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.208
- Every one.
- No, you don't.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.459
Look!

39:49.753 --> 39:52.047
I even had to make a dub
of "Dinner In America"

39:52.172 --> 39:54.258
because my Boombox
chewed up the original.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.843
♪ Mom and Dad

39:55.968 --> 39:58.095
♪ Conversations

39:58.220 --> 40:00.431

40:02.224 --> 40:04.977
Oh, I love John Q.
He's my favorite of my favorites!

40:05.102 --> 40:06.103
Knock it off.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.690
Knock it off.
You're getting yourself all worked up.

40:09.815 --> 40:12.109
You know, John Q. wears a ski mask
when they play.

40:12.234 --> 40:13.569
Yeah, everybody fuckin' knows that.

40:13.694 --> 40:16.530
Will you knock it off?
Stop flailing around!

40:16.655 --> 40:18.532
It's so cool.
It's like, it's top secret.

40:21.368 --> 40:23.078
- You wanna know my secret?
- No.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.371
Oh, come on.
It's a good one.

40:24.496 --> 40:26.498
I don't give a shit.

40:27.374 --> 40:29.335
I write John Q. love letters.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.045
What the fuck
are you talking about?

40:31.170 --> 40:34.590
Well, they're more like poems.
Love poems.

40:34.715 --> 40:37.468
- ♪ Dinner in America... ♪
- I write him one every week.

40:39.553 --> 40:42.431
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I just told you that.

40:42.556 --> 40:45.017
Is that weird?
Do you think I'm weird?

40:50.272 --> 40:52.149
Where's your fuckin' bathroom?

41:22.096 --> 41:25.641
Simon?
Are you doing a number two?

41:25.766 --> 41:28.727
Because, um... if you need
some extra toilet tissues,

41:28.852 --> 41:32.523
I can grab some for you
from the closet in the hall.

42:19.486 --> 42:21.488
Which one of you cunts
set this up?

42:26.493 --> 42:28.370
- He did.
- Fuckin"...

42:28.495 --> 42:29.747
- Hey, hey, you pricks!
- Get the fuck off me, Simon!

42:29.872 --> 42:31.248
I'm about to call the cops.

42:31.373 --> 42:32.583
Shove it up your ass, Lou!

42:32.708 --> 42:34.668
You're always about
to call the fuckin' cops.

42:34.793 --> 42:38.005
I'm serious! You order something
or take a fuckin' hike!

42:38.130 --> 42:41.341
- Then I demand a cup of coffee!
- Coffee?

42:41.467 --> 42:43.051
Does this look
like a men's shelter?

42:43.177 --> 42:44.219
You order something
off the dinner menu!

42:44.344 --> 42:48.682
Jesus fucking Christ, Lou!
Just get the coffee!

42:48.807 --> 42:51.143
Lady, you mind
your own fuckin' business,

42:51.268 --> 42:53.145
and you and me,
we're gonna get along fine.

42:55.147 --> 42:57.107
The Alliance?

42:57.232 --> 43:00.569
You assholes wanna play eyeliner punk
for a bunch of 14-year-old girls?

43:00.694 --> 43:02.780
Fuck, man. Someone's gotta
call the shots when you're MIA.

43:02.905 --> 43:06.867
MIA? How about gettin' scratch
for our next record, Seth?

43:06.992 --> 43:08.660
Feel free to chip in at any point.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.455
- So you got the money?
- I don't wanna fuckin' talk about it.

43:11.580 --> 43:14.374
You junkie fuck!
You spent it all on dope, huh?

43:14.500 --> 43:15.584
You better reel him the fuck in.

43:15.709 --> 43:17.544
- What a load of shit!
- What a load of shit?

43:17.669 --> 43:18.879
You're a load of shit, Morgan!

43:19.004 --> 43:21.298
In the last four months,
you've kicked in, what, 50 bucks

43:21.423 --> 43:22.800
and that piece of shit PA head?

43:22.925 --> 43:24.301
Fuck you!
That PA is 300 watts.

43:24.426 --> 43:26.804
Fuck you!
Fuck your 300 watts, OK?

43:26.929 --> 43:27.971
Fuck all of you!

43:28.096 --> 43:30.307
I'm the one floating
this whole operation.

43:30.432 --> 43:32.309
Do you know how much blood
I need to give

43:32.434 --> 43:34.061
to the fuckin' vampires
at the lab

43:34.186 --> 43:36.647
just to get our masters
out of this hostage situation?

43:36.772 --> 43:38.148
Yeah. Everyone just calm
the fuck down.

43:38.273 --> 43:40.234
- No. Why don't you calm the fuck down?
- Yeah?

43:40.359 --> 43:42.069
We still gotta do the jackets,
press the fuckin' vinyl.

43:42.194 --> 43:43.445
That's another three grand.

43:43.570 --> 43:47.699
Look, Eddie Sorvino
called me last week, OK?

43:47.825 --> 43:51.036
Monty played him the Majestic Twelve
session, and he fucking flipped.

43:51.161 --> 43:54.081
- That's how this whole thing started.
- Shut the fuck up, Morgan!

43:54.206 --> 43:57.042
He wants us to play this gig
with The Alliance, OK?

43:57.167 --> 43:59.294
See if we're a good fit,
feel us out.

43:59.419 --> 44:02.381
If the band likes us,
we're in for the last leg of the tour.

44:02.506 --> 44:03.882
"If the band likes us?"

44:04.007 --> 44:07.886
Plus he said he'd cover our dupes
and get us square with Monty.

44:08.011 --> 44:10.889
Sorvino knows we're good.
He thinks we can go places.

44:11.014 --> 44:14.142
Go places?
We're not fuckin' sailors.

44:14.268 --> 44:15.477
We're a punk rock band.

44:15.602 --> 44:18.230
Hey, asshole! This could be
our big fucking break, OK?

44:18.355 --> 44:22.150
Our big break? What the fuck
are you talking about?

44:24.778 --> 44:27.322
Look, you guys
want to play puppet show

44:27.447 --> 44:29.783
on Eddie Sorvino's
little circus tour,

44:29.908 --> 44:33.203
go right ahead, but leave me
the fuck out of it.

44:33.328 --> 44:35.330
- How about we vote on it?
- It's not a democracy.

44:35.998 --> 44:37.624
I vote we play
the fucking show.

44:37.749 --> 44:39.543
Me too.

44:39.668 --> 44:42.004
What about you, Donovan?

44:42.129 --> 44:45.632
Yeah, Donnie.
What about you?

44:48.218 --> 44:50.262
Fucking Christ,
I thought we went over this?

44:53.307 --> 44:56.184
- What's with you?
- Quaaludes.

44:59.396 --> 45:01.982
That's a good boy.

45:02.107 --> 45:06.486
You don't want to play
to a sea of cellphones, do ya?

45:06.612 --> 45:09.323
Bunch of pussies
doing the stand and stare.

45:10.949 --> 45:13.911
That's not what music is, is it?

45:14.036 --> 45:15.537
No.

45:16.788 --> 45:18.081
Goddamn it, lady!

45:18.206 --> 45:21.460
Go back to your shrimp basket,
mind your own fuckin' business!

45:21.585 --> 45:23.837
That's it!
All you punks out!

45:24.880 --> 45:26.214
Now! Move!

45:29.801 --> 45:32.930
Take the scarecrow with ya.

45:33.055 --> 45:36.350
So why the fuck did you guys cancel
the secret show on Friday?

45:36.475 --> 45:38.185
Cos we want to save your juice
for The Alliance gig.

45:38.310 --> 45:41.021
Stop talking about it
like it's fuckin' happenin'.

45:41.146 --> 45:42.856
It's making me nauseous.

45:42.981 --> 45:46.944
You assholes get the show back on
or we're fuckin' done!

45:47.069 --> 45:48.737
I'll call you Friday at noon.

45:48.862 --> 45:51.657
Yo, the heat came
by the lockout again.

45:51.782 --> 45:53.867
They got a real hard-on
for you, man.

45:53.992 --> 45:56.662
Yeah? And what the fuck
did you tell them, Morgan?

45:56.787 --> 45:59.539
Same old, same old,
that we only know you as John Q.

45:59.665 --> 46:03.794
We said you quit,
but I don't think they bought it.

46:03.919 --> 46:06.171
You're in some deep shit, Simon.

46:08.256 --> 46:09.758
Check this out.

46:11.343 --> 46:12.844
They upped the reward.

46:12.970 --> 46:17.474
5,000 bucks? Damn!

46:17.599 --> 46:20.644
They said you assaulted some lady.
Tried to burn her house down?

46:20.769 --> 46:23.480
That's fuckin' bullshit.

46:23.605 --> 46:25.899
They've been using this crummy
sketch for two years.

46:26.024 --> 46:27.401
At least they don't have
your real name.

46:27.526 --> 46:29.820
Yeah, except now
they're on to me.

46:29.945 --> 46:30.988
How do you know?

46:31.113 --> 46:32.406
Because there was
an unmarked squad car

46:32.531 --> 46:35.742
outside one of my crash pads,
that's how I know,

46:35.867 --> 46:37.911
which means
somebody fucking narced.

46:38.036 --> 46:39.997
- Don't look at me!
- I am lookin' at you.

46:40.122 --> 46:41.748
Hey, hey. Cool it, man.
He didn't say shit!

46:41.873 --> 46:43.500
Man, how the fuck do you know?

46:43.625 --> 46:46.253
I don't fuckin' trust
anybody right now!

46:46.378 --> 46:48.255
Come on.
Don't be paranoid.

46:48.380 --> 46:51.133
- You need a new place to crash?
- Not with you assholes.

46:51.258 --> 46:52.592
You want the keys
to the van then?

46:52.718 --> 46:53.927
No. I'm set.

46:54.553 --> 46:56.513
You're sure?

46:56.638 --> 47:00.142
Man, you wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

48:09.795 --> 48:12.130
Fucking cool it, rager!

48:12.255 --> 48:14.966
- Fuck!
- You ruined everything!

48:15.092 --> 48:17.385
Calm down or I'm gonna
fuckin' pop you!

48:17.511 --> 48:18.512
Get off me!

48:18.637 --> 48:19.971
You wasted my fucking tall boy.

48:20.097 --> 48:22.933
I hate you!

48:23.058 --> 48:24.434
You know, you've got it
pretty fuckin' good here

48:24.559 --> 48:27.395
for an adopted kid, so you
better quit your bitchin'.

48:27.521 --> 48:29.815
Look at that bunkbed.
It's fuckin' tits.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.234
You got a keyboard.
And what the fuck are those?

48:32.359 --> 48:34.653
- Hmm? Gerbils?
- Guinea pigs, asshole!

48:34.778 --> 48:35.737
Whatever.

48:35.862 --> 48:38.406
You know, your fuckin' problem
isn't that you're adopted,

48:38.532 --> 48:40.659
it's that you're uptight.

48:40.784 --> 48:44.454
I mean, fuck, kid, what, do you
need some weed or somethin'?

48:46.832 --> 48:48.583
You mean marijuana?

49:03.431 --> 49:04.933
You all right?

49:08.854 --> 49:10.480
How am I supposed to know
when that kicks in?

49:11.982 --> 49:14.359
Let me see those globes.

49:14.484 --> 49:17.779
Oh, yeah.
You're fuckin' pie-eyed, buddy.

49:17.904 --> 49:20.740
- Huh?
- You're baked.

49:22.742 --> 49:25.245
- Right now?
- Yeah.

49:25.370 --> 49:28.582
- You know how I can tell?
- How?

49:28.707 --> 49:32.127
I'm not sensing any hostility
comin' offa you.

49:33.336 --> 49:36.423
- That's weird. Right?
- Hm-hm.

49:38.633 --> 49:41.803
Look, do you want a little advice?

49:41.928 --> 49:43.221
Sure.

49:43.346 --> 49:47.851
You should be smokin' a gram
of that shit every day.

49:49.227 --> 49:52.230
- Won't I get hooked?
- Hopefully.

49:57.736 --> 50:00.447
Look, I'mma set you up
with a quarter,

50:00.572 --> 50:03.617
and then I'm gonna teach ya how
to roll a nice, tight bomber.

50:05.535 --> 50:07.287
Aw, thanks.

50:09.372 --> 50:13.251
Hey, did you turn the crickets up?

50:16.087 --> 50:18.673
Don't worry about the crickets.

50:20.175 --> 50:21.635
Yeah, you know,
I think I'm stoned.

50:21.760 --> 50:24.221
Yeah, you're really
fuckin' stoned.

50:24.346 --> 50:28.099
That shit burned out a minute ago
and you're still taking hits off of it.

50:54.918 --> 50:56.336
Hey.

50:56.962 --> 50:58.380
Hey.

51:00.465 --> 51:01.967
Where is everybody?

51:03.718 --> 51:06.554
Dad's at the office,
Mom took Kevin to high school.

51:08.390 --> 51:09.683
Hm.

51:12.060 --> 51:13.937
You got any coffee left?

51:16.815 --> 51:18.191
It's cold.

51:18.316 --> 51:19.442
I'm not supposed to have
anything turned on

51:19.567 --> 51:20.986
when I'm alone at the house.

51:24.197 --> 51:25.865
What are you doin'?

51:26.908 --> 51:29.869
I am looking for my purpose.

51:29.995 --> 51:31.830
Your purpose?

51:32.998 --> 51:37.794
Mom says I need to find my purpose
now that I lost my job at The Pet Zone.

51:37.919 --> 51:40.797
Look, she circled
all the good ones.

51:40.922 --> 51:41.965
Let me see that.

51:43.883 --> 51:45.302
Dishwasher?

51:46.845 --> 51:48.972
That's a shit job.

51:49.097 --> 51:51.725
Yeah, that's what I said,
but then Dad said that maybe

51:51.850 --> 51:53.393
I could work my way up
to the prep table.

51:53.518 --> 51:55.061
Oh, my God.

51:55.186 --> 51:58.857
That's so fuckin' bleak,
it's makin' me lightheaded.

52:01.609 --> 52:04.029
Table washer at the food court
in the mall?

52:08.575 --> 52:11.077
God, that coffee taste like shit.

52:13.747 --> 52:15.165
It's Sanka.

52:20.003 --> 52:23.089
- You got any scratch?
- Huh?

52:24.341 --> 52:27.010
- Money?
- Nope.

52:27.135 --> 52:31.264
Mr. Hanley still owes me
for two weeks.

52:31.389 --> 52:36.019
That motherfucker never cut you
a check after he fired you?

52:36.144 --> 52:39.564
Mm-mm.

52:39.689 --> 52:42.984
Well, we're gonna pay him
a little visit today.

52:43.109 --> 52:46.363
And then afterwards,
I'm gonna let you buy me lunch.

52:49.657 --> 52:51.159
Hey, can we shoot hoops first?

52:58.833 --> 53:00.919
Dang!

53:01.044 --> 53:03.296
You're good at basketball!

53:08.218 --> 53:11.346
What do you say
we play H-O-R-S-E?

53:11.471 --> 53:13.807
What do you say
we play F-U-C-K instead?

53:17.102 --> 53:19.813
You ever played F-U-C-K before?

53:26.111 --> 53:28.279
Here's my spot, OK?

53:34.744 --> 53:37.580
How come you clam up
whenever I talk about fuckin'?

53:43.253 --> 53:45.255
You ever make it with a guy?

54:01.938 --> 54:03.440
Woohoo!

54:05.942 --> 54:07.152
Your turn.

54:10.321 --> 54:13.324
All right, how 'bout this?

54:13.450 --> 54:17.787
If I make this shot,
then you give me a kiss.

54:20.999 --> 54:22.625
A tongue Kiss.

54:24.669 --> 54:26.087
OK.

54:27.755 --> 54:29.257
Yeah?

54:31.134 --> 54:32.302
Yeah.

54:47.942 --> 54:49.819
What the fuck?

54:49.944 --> 54:52.405
Hey, you got a dead cat here.

54:52.530 --> 54:56.701
Yeah. It's been there
since Monday.

54:56.826 --> 54:59.162
So why the fuck don't you
bury it or something?

54:59.287 --> 55:01.664
I don't know. I've just been,
like, watching it.

55:01.789 --> 55:04.375
- Why?
- I don't know.

55:05.835 --> 55:07.879
That's some creepy shit.

55:08.004 --> 55:09.964
- It is?
- Yeah.

55:10.089 --> 55:11.799
That's like serial killer shit.

55:11.925 --> 55:13.927
- It is?
- Yeah.

55:17.764 --> 55:19.307
Do you think I'm weird?

55:19.432 --> 55:21.809
Oh, yeah.
No, you're fuckin' weird.

55:21.935 --> 55:25.813
- Well, is weird cool?
- In your case, no.

55:25.939 --> 55:29.984
- Well, do you think I'm cool?
- I just said no.

55:30.109 --> 55:31.611
Huh?

55:32.946 --> 55:34.656
I'm fuckin' with you again.

55:35.532 --> 55:36.866
Let's go!

55:44.415 --> 55:46.292
So how much
does this hand job owe you?

55:46.417 --> 55:48.962
Like, 400 bucks.

55:49.087 --> 55:51.714
What if I told you
I could double that in a day?

55:51.839 --> 55:53.883
- How?
- Magic.

55:54.968 --> 55:56.886
Like, real magic?

55:57.011 --> 55:58.888
Shit, it's the pigs.

56:01.266 --> 56:03.893
- Well, here comes the 113.
- Don't look.

56:15.738 --> 56:17.323
Go.

56:17.448 --> 56:19.158
What the...
one fuckin' step, come on!

56:20.743 --> 56:22.161
Shit!

56:28.626 --> 56:30.336
- I'm gonna run.
- No.

56:30.461 --> 56:33.881
They'll catch you.
Cops are fast.

56:40.388 --> 56:43.808
They parked on the other side
of the street.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.059
What are they doin'?

56:45.602 --> 56:47.395
Looks like
they're eating burritos.

56:55.486 --> 56:59.324
Hey, fuckpie.
You here for the deuce?

56:59.449 --> 57:02.076
Oh, she's ready to fuck, D.
All hot and bothered.

57:02.201 --> 57:03.244
Just check out
her candy-apple cheeks.

57:04.787 --> 57:06.331
What the fuck?

57:06.456 --> 57:08.166
Hey, this seat-sniffer
pervin' on you, retard?

57:08.291 --> 57:09.584
No, he's my boyfriend.

57:10.543 --> 57:11.753
That so?

57:11.878 --> 57:13.504
I'm not her boyfriend.

57:14.881 --> 57:18.259
- Retard's got a boyfriend.
- Apparently, this faggot here.

57:18.384 --> 57:20.261
Shut the fuck up.

57:20.386 --> 57:22.555
Don't call her a retard.

57:22.680 --> 57:23.723
Can you believe this faggot?

57:23.848 --> 57:25.183
Yeah, he's got a faggot mouth
on him, too.

57:25.308 --> 57:27.518
That's an awful lot of faggot
talk comin' from two guys

57:27.644 --> 57:29.354
that look like they're made
for a Russian circle jerk.

57:29.479 --> 57:31.022
Oh, you're dissing
our tracksuits, faggot?

57:31.147 --> 57:35.485
Yeah. I'm dissing
your motherfuckin' tracksuits.

57:35.985 --> 57:38.529
'Stop requested.'

57:43.201 --> 57:44.786
That's what I thought, bitch.

57:44.911 --> 57:48.039
All you punk faggots got a lot of lip,
but you can't back it up.

57:48.164 --> 57:50.208
Hey, come on, D.
We're gonna be late for practice.

57:56.756 --> 58:01.886
I hope he's got a decent cock, retard,
cos he can't fight for shit.

58:02.011 --> 58:04.263
We're still free after practice
if you wanna fuck.

58:23.116 --> 58:26.119
Where are we going?

58:26.244 --> 58:30.164
Slow down!
My legs aren't as long as yours.

58:34.919 --> 58:36.963
I'll give you
everything in my pocket

58:37.088 --> 58:38.673
if you let me borrow
your truck for an hour.

58:38.798 --> 58:40.383
Far out, man.

58:42.635 --> 58:44.095
Shit, keep her all weekend.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.264
Toss me that mini bat, too.

58:49.892 --> 58:52.603
Buckle up!
I drive fuckin' nuts!

58:52.729 --> 58:56.190
- It feels like we're on TV!
- This ain't fuckin' TV!

59:01.446 --> 59:02.822
Why are we at my house?

59:02.947 --> 59:06.784
Get your Polaroid, a trash bag
and meet me out back.

59:24.594 --> 59:26.471
Twist it up.

59:26.596 --> 59:28.431
Let's go.

59:34.604 --> 59:36.230
What are they doin'?

59:36.355 --> 59:39.275
It's like they're warming up.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.985
And stretching.

59:45.239 --> 59:47.784
Show 'em your tits.

59:47.909 --> 59:50.870
- Huh?
- Lift up your shirt.

59:50.995 --> 59:53.080
- No.
- Just do it.

01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:05.885
Whoa!
Check it.

01:00:07.345 --> 01:00:08.721
- Dude!
- Oh, my God!

01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.223
Hey, hey!

01:00:10.348 --> 01:00:11.808
Where the fuck
are you douchebags goin'?

01:00:11.933 --> 01:00:14.393
Uh, we'll be right back, Coach.
We gotta take care of something.

01:00:14.519 --> 01:00:15.937
Yeah.

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:23.319
- They're coming!
- Good.

01:00:23.444 --> 01:00:25.321
Lay down
on those tackle dummies.

01:00:25.446 --> 01:00:27.824
- Why?
- Trust me.

01:00:27.949 --> 01:00:29.659
No, on your tummy.
Turn around.

01:00:29.784 --> 01:00:31.160
Try to look provocative.

01:00:31.285 --> 01:00:32.703
Huh?

01:00:34.205 --> 01:00:37.208
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:42.672
Dude, I told you she was in heat.

01:00:42.797 --> 01:00:44.215
Go.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.761
Let's double stuff this tard.

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:50.680
Ah, fuck yeah.

01:00:57.144 --> 01:00:59.981
- Now what?
- Strip 'em.

01:01:20.835 --> 01:01:24.297
Dump it right in the middle
of this shit fuckin' sandwich.

01:01:37.184 --> 01:01:38.853
- Coach?
- Huh?

01:01:38.978 --> 01:01:41.147
I think the equipment shed
is on fire.

01:01:42.523 --> 01:01:44.317
Holy shit.

01:01:48.529 --> 01:01:49.739
Hold this.

01:01:49.864 --> 01:01:52.575
Wake up, cat fuckers!

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.745
Come here.
It's a little memento.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.372
You ever call her a retard again,

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:01.250
and this bitch is gonna haunt you
for the rest of your fuckin' life.

01:02:03.169 --> 01:02:06.172
Catfuckers!

01:02:10.009 --> 01:02:11.510
Let's beat it.

01:02:20.853 --> 01:02:23.981
Come on! Let's go!
Woohoo!

01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:37.370
Fucking' punk!

01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:40.206
What in the fuck is going on?

01:02:40.331 --> 01:02:42.792
Jesus fuck!
Get up!

01:02:42.917 --> 01:02:44.377
Get up!

01:02:46.837 --> 01:02:50.049
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck those jock assholes!

01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:52.802
Oh, my God!
That was just like TV!

01:02:52.927 --> 01:02:55.721
Man, fuck TV!
That was some raw ass shit!

01:02:55.846 --> 01:02:57.556
- Simon?
- Yeah?

01:02:57.682 --> 01:03:01.102
- Are we going to jail?
- Probably.

01:03:12.446 --> 01:03:16.575
Welcome to Pet Zone.
How may I assist you today?

01:03:16.701 --> 01:03:19.245
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

01:03:20.955 --> 01:03:22.415
Why are you working here?

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.583
Uh... I don't know
what you mean.

01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:26.711
Where's your smock?

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.796
Why are you putting stickers
on the cat food?

01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:31.132
- Mr. Hanley?
- Yes?

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.386
Mr. Hanley, what...
what is she doing here?

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.975
You said that you were going back
to cleaning out the cages yourself

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.186
because Michigan
was raising the minimum wage.

01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:48.190
Look, Patty, you're a nice
enough kid and all,

01:03:48.315 --> 01:03:51.027
but let's face it,
you're a little slow.

01:03:53.112 --> 01:03:56.907
Too slow for what,
this crummy ass pet store?

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:59.452
Where's her fuckin' check?

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:01.746
Rebecca, why don't you, uh...

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.581
head back to the grooming
station and take your break.

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.666
Uh-uh. Don't you listen
to this geezer.

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:10.046
- I want you to stay put.
- It's OK.

01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:12.840
Why do you keep
fuckin' lookin' at her?

01:04:14.091 --> 01:04:16.427
I am not slow, Mr. Hanley,

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:20.890
and I know where everything in
this store is better than you!

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.975
And especially her!

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.436
Where's the goddamn paycheck?

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.687
I told Patty I'd put it in the mail
at the end of the week.

01:04:26.812 --> 01:04:31.692
- It is the end of the week!
- I want my motherfucking check!

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.128
- You know what you want?
- I'll have the Hawaiian.

01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:55.633
Hawaiian, huh?

01:04:57.009 --> 01:05:01.388
It has a pineapple ring
and a slice of ham on top.

01:05:01.514 --> 01:05:03.516
What kind of sauce?

01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:06.185
Hm, I don't know.

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.354
Hey, what kind of sauce
comes on the Hawaiian?

01:05:08.479 --> 01:05:10.606
Like, a honey glaze.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:21.033
All right,
two Hawaiian sandwiches.

01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:31.877
You want some
of my Jimbo fries?

01:05:34.213 --> 01:05:35.714
Yeah, all right.

01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:43.597
- So, is this, like, a date?
- Hmm?

01:05:44.557 --> 01:05:46.725
Are we on a date?

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.189
No, this is a shitty lunch.

01:05:56.569 --> 01:06:00.614
Besides, I thought you
were in love with John Q.

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:04.743
Yeah, but he's not real.
He's just my music boyfriend.

01:06:06.704 --> 01:06:08.747
Well, I'm gonna take you
to see PSYOPS tomorrow night.

01:06:08.873 --> 01:06:10.708
You're gonna see
your music boyfriend.

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:17.047
Well, is that a date?

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:19.091
Yeah, it's a date.

01:06:25.723 --> 01:06:27.141
Simon?

01:06:31.437 --> 01:06:32.855
You can kiss me now.

01:06:34.106 --> 01:06:35.107
It's OK.

01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:38.068
I want you to.

01:07:09.016 --> 01:07:10.517
You can fuck off now.

01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:20.194
You're a real good kisser.

01:07:23.197 --> 01:07:24.698
Seriously.

01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:27.952
I would not have guessed that.

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:31.747
Thanks.

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:37.962
I guess all my practice
with Kevin really pays off.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.761
What?

01:07:45.886 --> 01:07:48.847
Well, he's not
my real brother. Duh.

01:07:48.973 --> 01:07:50.641
He's adopted.

01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:58.857
I'm just fucking with you.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.030
You need to take it
down a notch.

01:08:07.157 --> 01:08:08.784
You need to take it
down a notch.

01:08:08.909 --> 01:08:11.996
And you! You need to take it
down a notch, too.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:23.881
- So much for job hunting, huh?
- Fuck job hunting.

01:08:25.676 --> 01:08:28.804
I'll drive you around tomorrow
in the truck.

01:08:28.929 --> 01:08:30.430
Sweet.

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:38.354
- Hey, you wanna go fuck around?
- Yeah, sure.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.649

01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:31.760
I want him.

01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:40.060
Wait in line.

01:10:40.727 --> 01:10:42.271
Where are you going?

01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:18.182
I hope Mom's not miffed
we missed dinner.

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.850
Thursday night
is always a big hit.

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:22.186
What's Thursday?

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:23.979
New England clam chowder.

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.649
Fucking Christ.

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:42.122
Hey, Simon?

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.335
Yeah?

01:11:47.794 --> 01:11:52.007
Thanks for, like, the best day ever.

01:11:59.264 --> 01:12:01.350
I decided on a name for him.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.021
What?

01:12:08.398 --> 01:12:10.526
Chomby.

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:17.324
Chomby.

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:30.921
- You back for seconds, Kev?
- Hm?

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.881
That chowder
must've been tits, huh?

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.803
- Yo, what happened to your eye?
- Don't worry about it.

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:44.935
What are you doing?
Why aren't you wearing pants?

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.604
Oh, we should talk.
Things have gotten a little crazy.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.524
Look, everything was OK

01:12:50.649 --> 01:12:53.235
until Mom and Dad ate
some of Jill's brownies.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.737
Wait a minute.
Who's Jill?

01:12:55.862 --> 01:12:58.740
- Hey!
- Jill.

01:12:58.865 --> 01:13:00.367
What's she doing here?

01:13:01.618 --> 01:13:05.747
- She's shy.
- I'm not wearing pants.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.543
Why is she not wearing pants?

01:13:09.668 --> 01:13:12.045
Or underwear.
Kev, you sinking the pink?

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:15.465
Look, Simon,
you were totally right, man.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:19.303
Everything changed for me
when I started smoking pot.

01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:25.809
- What's the pink?
- Vagina.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.436
'So, what we're gonna do

01:13:27.561 --> 01:13:28.895
'is just whisk it all together,

01:13:29.021 --> 01:13:32.983
'and you want to whisk it together
so that any of the... the cocoa powder

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.818
'and the cornstarch
all get mixed with the granulated...'

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:38.655
Hey, kids.
He's making toffee.

01:13:39.531 --> 01:13:42.367
Dad?
Are you OK?

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.413
Oh, yeah.

01:13:46.538 --> 01:13:48.248
How did the job hunt go?

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:52.127
Oh, I don't know, I...

01:13:52.252 --> 01:13:54.630
I guess we'll see
if anyone calls.

01:13:54.755 --> 01:13:57.299
Oh, don't they just hire you
if they like you?

01:13:57.424 --> 01:14:00.636
Well, there were
multiple candidates.

01:14:00.761 --> 01:14:04.056
Oh, hi, Simon.
What happened to your face?

01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:07.309
I fell down the escalator
at the shopping mall.

01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:10.312
Mm.

01:14:10.437 --> 01:14:14.191
You should go to the freezer,
get the peas, put them on that eye.

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:18.570
Yeah, I can't.
Kev's guarding it like a hawk.

01:14:18.695 --> 01:14:20.364
That's his turf now.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.575
Oh. You know he has a girlfriend?

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.411
Yeah, I do. Jill.

01:14:26.536 --> 01:14:27.871
She's a real peach.

01:14:29.748 --> 01:14:33.627
Look, Mom, Simon's gonna take me
to a rock show on Friday night.

01:14:33.752 --> 01:14:36.463
Oh, we talked about that.

01:14:36.588 --> 01:14:39.883
We don't like rock concerts for her
because of the strobe lights.

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.135
There's not gonna be any
fuckin' strobe lights, Connie.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.930
- You're thinking of a rave.
- What's that?

01:14:45.055 --> 01:14:49.017
It's a bunch of drug addicts,
glowsticks, shit fuckin' music.

01:14:51.395 --> 01:14:55.816
- Have you heard of the raves?
- Oh, yeah.

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:57.943
- Mom?
- What?

01:14:58.068 --> 01:15:00.737
Why are you and Dad
not wearing any pants?

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.450
I'm not sure.

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:34.896
What the fuck
is going on in here?

01:15:36.273 --> 01:15:37.691
Is this provocative?

01:15:39.443 --> 01:15:41.862
I don't know what that is.

01:15:43.155 --> 01:15:45.949
Kill that ghetto blaster,
will ya?

01:15:53.832 --> 01:15:57.753
Do you want to put your hands
inside my sweatpants?

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:06.511
Look, how about a raincheck, hm?

01:16:06.636 --> 01:16:08.847
I don't even know
if I can get hard right now.

01:16:08.972 --> 01:16:12.434
My face feels like
fuckin' hamburger.

01:16:14.186 --> 01:16:15.729
What do you got in that maraca?

01:16:15.854 --> 01:16:18.482
- My EZ-Dose?
- Yeah.

01:16:19.191 --> 01:16:20.776
Just my medications.

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:22.527
Well, hook me up
with Sunday and Monday.

01:16:22.652 --> 01:16:24.571
I'm fuckin' dyin' here.

01:16:40.587 --> 01:16:41.963
Fuck.

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:48.720
Hey, Simon?

01:16:48.845 --> 01:16:50.138
Mm-hm.

01:16:51.348 --> 01:16:53.350
What's a raincheck?

01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:01.441
Simon?

01:17:06.738 --> 01:17:08.573
Simon?

01:17:13.203 --> 01:17:16.081
Sim...

01:17:17.707 --> 01:17:19.918
You've gotta wake up.
You've been asleep for eleven hours.

01:17:20.043 --> 01:17:23.797
Oh, fuck.
Those pills are lethal.

01:17:26.258 --> 01:17:28.510
You blast those every day?

01:17:34.391 --> 01:17:35.851
Can you drive me
to China Hut?

01:17:35.976 --> 01:17:37.477
I've got an interview
in 30 minutes.

01:17:41.648 --> 01:17:43.191
All right.

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:51.408
Are we going in circles?

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:54.703
Cos that's the third time
I've seen those garden gnomes.

01:17:56.746 --> 01:17:59.583
Why do you keep looking
at that house?

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.001
We're still going
job hunting, right?

01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:04.087
Man, fuck job hunting.
Fuck China Hut.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:06.506
Fuck America.

01:18:06.631 --> 01:18:08.341
I mean, are you really excited
to clean dishes

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.969
in the back
of some shithole buffet?

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:19.978
Wait, what am I supposed to say
if someone answers the door?

01:18:20.103 --> 01:18:22.898
I don't know, just say
you lost your dog.

01:18:23.023 --> 01:18:24.399
Ask if they've seen it
in the garden or some shit.

01:18:24.524 --> 01:18:27.736
- Yeah, but I don't have a dog.
- Yeah, I know.

01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:30.196
It's just pretend.

01:18:30.322 --> 01:18:32.657
Oh. OK.

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.578
Can the dog's name be Chomby?

01:18:37.704 --> 01:18:39.122
Yeah.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.856
Nobody is in here.

01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:22.999
You're not gonna burn
this house down, are you?

01:19:23.124 --> 01:19:25.335
What? No.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.545
I live here sometimes.

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:35.011
Holy smokes, a real trap set.
Can I play it?

01:19:35.136 --> 01:19:36.972
Knock yourself out.

01:19:40.684 --> 01:19:42.727
Yo.

01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:46.439
Where?
Where and when's the show?

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:50.902
All right, don't be late.

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.906
You suck at drums.

01:19:56.157 --> 01:19:59.119
Yeah, I'm more of a singer.

01:19:59.244 --> 01:20:01.538
You sing, huh?

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.707
Like what?

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:06.626
Oh, like, just, like,
little songs I hear in my head.

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:08.962
Hey, whose equipment is all this?

01:20:09.087 --> 01:20:11.214
- It was mine.
- Really?

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:13.675
- Mm-hm.
- You could play all these?

01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:19.639
Come here.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.600
I want to tell you something.
Come here.

01:20:31.192 --> 01:20:33.987
Are you all right?

01:20:34.112 --> 01:20:37.741
Yeah, I just hit my elbow a little...

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.410
...and my ribs.

01:20:42.912 --> 01:20:44.581
All right, listen.

01:20:49.836 --> 01:20:52.088
I'm John Q.

01:20:53.757 --> 01:20:55.091
What?

01:20:56.092 --> 01:20:58.803
I'm John Q. from PSYOPS.

01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:02.557
You're not John Q.
Nobody knows who John Q. is.

01:21:02.682 --> 01:21:07.312
Don't you think that maybe
John Q. knows who John Q. is?

01:21:09.481 --> 01:21:11.316
What?

01:21:15.779 --> 01:21:17.781
Close your eyes.

01:21:20.784 --> 01:21:22.452
Close 'em.

01:21:39.803 --> 01:21:41.304
Open 'em.

01:21:46.559 --> 01:21:48.436
Big deal.

01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:50.772
Looks just like the one I had
for Toboggan Club.

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.442
Smell it.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.157
Ugh.

01:22:01.282 --> 01:22:03.743
It smells like the headphones
on the hearing van.

01:22:03.868 --> 01:22:05.995
That's the sweat of every show
we've ever played

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.956
trapped in this fucker.

01:22:09.499 --> 01:22:11.042
That's the smell
of rock and roll.

01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:14.295
What?

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.756
You're still not convinced?

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.309
Oh, my God.

01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:34.858
You are John Q.

01:22:36.192 --> 01:22:39.737
That's fuckin' awkward, huh?

01:22:39.863 --> 01:22:41.990
I mean, not as awkward
as beating off to a torso

01:22:42.115 --> 01:22:45.869
on a cartoon bedspread
for two years, I guess.

01:22:48.454 --> 01:22:52.917
You have any idea how worked up
those Polaroids got me?

01:22:57.881 --> 01:22:59.507
Did you write all those?

01:23:02.802 --> 01:23:04.929
Fuckin' A.

01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:06.556
How?

01:23:08.725 --> 01:23:10.351
I mean, you call them
love poems,

01:23:10.476 --> 01:23:13.730
but they're really these...
these brilliant power pop songs.

01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:17.901
I mean, they're fuckin' genius.

01:23:21.613 --> 01:23:24.949
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.581
Will you say something to me?

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.458
Are you all right?

01:23:42.133 --> 01:23:44.135
No, leave it.

01:23:46.137 --> 01:23:47.805
Violate me.

01:23:48.932 --> 01:23:50.600
Fuck me.

01:24:26.219 --> 01:24:28.763
I think I want more violation.

01:24:30.473 --> 01:24:32.558
I gotta save my juice.

01:24:34.143 --> 01:24:35.895
Let's rock out.

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:38.940
OK, hit it.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.444
It's rolling.

01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:25.236
I can't believe all that
only took, like, 20 minutes.

01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:30.241
This one right here,
August 13th.

01:25:30.366 --> 01:25:31.909
That was my favorite.

01:25:36.039 --> 01:25:39.542
- You really want me to do this?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.670
Let's see what you got.

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.799
OK, can I have a kiss?

He's definitely on dope.

All right, back off, Renae.
I'm not on dope.

01:29:26.352 --> 01:29:27.979
He totally is, Mom. I can tell.
He won't look at me.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:37.905
We learned about dope
in D.A.R.E.

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:40.116
Dopers share needles
and get AIDS.

01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:42.868

Oh, it's nice
to see you too, Dad.

01:29:46.622 --> 01:29:50.209
- Answer your father.
- If it's about money, no way.

01:29:50.334 --> 01:29:52.795
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm not after your goddamn money.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.256
There's an agenda, Mom.
There's always an agenda.

01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:58.009
If I were you, I'd check
my jewelry box before he bails.

01:29:58.134 --> 01:30:00.303
- Shut the fuck up, Renae!
- Strike two.

01:30:03.389 --> 01:30:06.559

What are you doin'?

01:30:06.684 --> 01:30:08.311
- What is this?
- He's high, Mom.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.104
Don't pay attention to him.
It's what he wants.

01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:11.939

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:27.997
- Did you give him your key?
- Yeah. So?

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.332
Why'd you do that?

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.875
You know he's not supposed
to be in here, right?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.211
- Relax, Renae.
- I need to relax, Danny?

01:30:34.337 --> 01:30:35.880
Poor Mom had to come home

01:30:36.005 --> 01:30:37.548
and find these two
in the basement shooting up.

01:30:37.673 --> 01:30:38.841
Oh, my God.

01:30:41.093 --> 01:30:42.219
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

01:30:42.345 --> 01:30:44.263
Nobody's shooting dope,
all right?

01:30:44.388 --> 01:30:47.058
We were writing a song
in the basement.

01:30:47.183 --> 01:30:48.434
I can't do this anymore!

01:30:48.559 --> 01:30:50.311
Great, now Dad's upset.

01:30:52.563 --> 01:30:55.316
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:56.942
You're all being mean!

01:30:58.402 --> 01:30:59.403
He doesn't do dope.

01:30:59.528 --> 01:31:01.405
He just ate Sunday and Monday
from my EZ-Dose

01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:03.491
because he got beat up.

01:31:03.616 --> 01:31:04.867
Mommy, what is she talking about?

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:08.079
I have no idea. I think she's
just as strung out as he is.

01:31:08.204 --> 01:31:09.997
OK, you know what?
Leave her out of this.

01:31:10.122 --> 01:31:12.583
Look, you seem
like a nice enough girl,

01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:14.251
but I'm sure
he's got you brainwashed

01:31:14.377 --> 01:31:16.837
or he's manipulating you
with drugs somehow.

01:31:16.962 --> 01:31:19.340
Simon is a pathological liar.

01:31:19.465 --> 01:31:22.927
He's a thief and a total pyro.

01:31:23.052 --> 01:31:24.387
Hey, you know the cops have been
sniffing around for you?

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:25.513
Yeah.

01:31:25.638 --> 01:31:27.181
They came by the office
and grilled me for a half hour.

01:31:27.306 --> 01:31:30.184
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

01:31:30.309 --> 01:31:32.728
It's OK, Mom.
He'll be gone soon.

01:31:32.853 --> 01:31:34.480
What's a pyro again?

01:31:34.605 --> 01:31:37.066
