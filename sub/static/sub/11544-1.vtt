02:27.120 --> 02:29.918
I'm sorry you couldn't
come over for dinner.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.996
- What dinner?
- Last night.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.112
Rose talked to Angie about it.
She said you guys were busy.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.595
She never mentioned that.
We were watching TV.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.870
You missed a good dinner, Frank.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.753
I don't know what's wrong
with Angela lately. I gotta talk to her.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.871
Right on time.

02:57.280 --> 03:02.798
<i>Passengers for the train arriving
on track four, please watch your step.</i>

03:03.760 --> 03:05.716
I love you!

04:25.680 --> 04:29.753
- How do these people do it every day?
- It's like fuckin' sardines.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.234
<i>Every time I think of you</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:37.399
<i>I feel shot right through

04:37.520 --> 04:41.115
<i>It's no problem of mine,
but it's a problem I find</i>

04:41.800 --> 04:44.519
<i>Living a life that I can't leave behind...</i>

04:44.640 --> 04:47.029
I tell you what, Angela.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.550
It all boils down to good follicles.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.118
Youve been blessed.
One head in a million.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.710
I ran into her at Foodtown.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.035
- I invited her over for dinner.
- Yeah?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.116
But Angela says they're busy.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.232
Then, this morning,
Tommy is talking to Frankie.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.749
- Turns out they were home last night.
- Stop!

05:06.880 --> 05:11.237
Frankie didn't know anything about it.
She never even told her own husband.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.794
Who the hell does she think she is?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.875
Mrs D, you don't like it?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.434
No, no. It's not the cut.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.516
Thanks, Ray.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.270
- Connie!
- Hey, doll! How are you?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.030
Oh, look at you. A redhead!

05:51.560 --> 05:53.755

06:03.960 --> 06:07.077

06:07.200 --> 06:11.352
You comin' to the card game tonight?
Come on. We haven't seen you in an age.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.790
No, I gotta help Joey.
He's having a lot of trouble in school.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.753
Of course he is!
He hangs out with Tony Junior.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.555
Face it, these boys will never be Einstein.
Come on over tonight.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.434
No, I really can't.
Listen, I gota go. I'm real sorry.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.313
Have a great time.
It was great to see you guys.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.590
Bye. Take care.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.710
That bitch! She thinks her shit don't stink.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.870
I have three cards.
One red - you can take all my bread -

07:05.000 --> 07:07.309
and two blacks - that'll set you back.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.512
Watch it, chase it, see where I place it.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.676
- It's right here.
- That's it.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.155
Give me five and you win ten.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.589
Aw...

07:17.720 --> 07:21.633

- Tough luck, giris. Try again.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.674
Hey! What's goin' on here?

07:25.040 --> 07:27.600

07:31.680 --> 07:35.389
- You playing for money?
- No, we were just playing for fun.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.193
Right, guys?

07:41.360 --> 07:45.672
I want all of youse to go home.
Joseph Francis, I'll talk to you inside.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.952

07:58.320 --> 08:00.072

08:00.200 --> 08:03.431

08:03.560 --> 08:07.235
- You playing cards at Connies tonight?
- No. What are you looking for?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.794
No? Why not?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.956
I don't feel like it.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.070
Angela, when the bosss wife
asks you to play cards, you go.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.239
I don't have to jump every time
Connie or Tony snaps their fingers.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.070
I don't know what's wrong with you lately.
All the other guys, their wives get along.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.397
Tommy and Rose invite us to dinner.
You lie to them.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.592
They used to be your friends.
Now you can't stand them?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.438
That makes me look bad.
How am I to get ahead in the family?

08:34.559 --> 08:38.188
Same way you always have.
Lie, cheat, steal, kill.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.110
Very funny. Youre a comedian now, huh?

08:41.240 --> 08:44.073
<i>I should get you on fuckin Star Search.</i>

08:44.200 --> 08:46.555
- Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.
- Hey, hey.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.434
Come here. I do not want you takin
money from those kids any more.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.473
- It was Tony Juniors idea!
- Oh! What, that makes it OK?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.877
- You playing three-card monte again?
- Yeah.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.753

09:01.920 --> 09:03.512
- Not bad.
- Thanks, Dad.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.871
Thanks, Frankie.
I'm trying to teach him something.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.797
He's only a kid.

09:08.920 --> 09:13.118
- What are you looking for?
- My revolver. Where is my revolver?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.831
- Here, Dad.
- Joey, give me that!

09:21.920 --> 09:24.514
- Go to your room, Joey.
- Come on, Lucky!

09:26.120 --> 09:28.076
Thank you, Joey.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.833
That's great, Frank. That's really great.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.355
It's not loaded, Angela.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.515
- I can't believe it.
- I'll keep it locked up from now on.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.313
It's not just the gun, Frank. It's everything.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.590
It's this whole life.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.796
Your life is so bad?

09:54.440 --> 09:57.830
You have a beautiful house,
plenty of money, a great kid,

09:57.960 --> 10:00.474
a husband who loves you.
What more do you want?

10:00.600 --> 10:04.798
I want a normal life. I'm sick and tired
of the gambling, the guns,

10:04.920 --> 10:09.198
<i>bailing you outa jail, never knowing
when or if you're gonna come home.</i>

10:09.320 --> 10:14.235
Look at this place! Everything we wear,
everything we own, fell of a truck!

10:14.360 --> 10:18.194
Sh! Take it easy, baby.
I don't think you're making much sense.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.112
When I look at this house, I see
a swell house with beautiful furnishings.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.472
When I go up in Joeys room,
I see all the things we give him.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.672
Things you and I never had
when we was growin up.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.791
Frankie, don't you get it?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.195
Everything has blood on it.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.076
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this garbage!

10:39.200 --> 10:40.599
- Neither do I!
- No?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.518
- No!
- No? What are you gonna do about it?

10:43.640 --> 10:46.200
<i>- I want a divorce!
- </i>

10:51.120 --> 10:54.715
Listen to Dr de Marco
for just a second, darling, all right?

10:54.840 --> 10:56.990
You go upstairs, you take a Valium.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.995
You lie down, relax.
You'll feel a lot beter. All right, darling?

11:14.280 --> 11:16.589
<i> Well, well, well.</i>

11:17.720 --> 11:19.790

11:20.840 --> 11:24.469

his two nephews, Al The Worm and...

11:24.600 --> 11:27.558
Dont tell me. Vinnie The Slug.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.716
Your common, garden-variety hoodlums.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.758
- Special Agent Downey, FBI.
- Let him by.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.313
Yesterday The Fat Man buys a one-way
ticket on the Long Island railroad.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.638
19 hours later,
Cucumber Frank de Marco takes a bath.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.274
It looks like payback time.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.631
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The place is clean.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.513
I don't know, sir. Doesnt add up.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.200
You got a beter make on it?

19:36.320 --> 19:39.039
The late Karen Lutnick
was Tony Russos girlfriend.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.878
No shit.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.118
Maybe Frank was indiscreet. They don't
call him The Cucumber for nothing.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.231
Karen was a real dish.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.352
Tony finds out Franks eating of his plate.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.711
Tonys got a temper.
A man gets angry, he gets sloppy.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.115
Maybe The Tiger did it himself.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.879
- That's murder one.
- Two counts. We could hang him.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.230
Put me back on 24-hour surveillance.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.636
I'll nail Tony for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.639
Let us pray for our brother
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said:

20:09.680 --> 20:12.274
I am the resurrection and the life.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.552
The man who believes in me
will live even if he dies.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.559
Frank... My baby...

20:19.680 --> 20:22.399
- We know that he will raise up...
- Such a good boy.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.116
We commend our brother to the Lord.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.360
May the Lord receive him into his peace

20:29.840 --> 20:33.753
and raise up his body
on the last day. Amen.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.594
- Frank! I'm coming with you!
- Mama!

20:43.680 --> 20:45.989
Mama, no! Mama!

20:47.840 --> 20:50.559
They found them in the tub... naked.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.956
- What goes around comes around.
- Here she comes.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.475
- Youse don't have to clean up.
- Angela, sh! Just be quiet, OK?

20:59.600 --> 21:03.513
- Thanks, you guys. I appreciate this.
- What are friends for?

21:03.640 --> 21:07.030
And we are your friends, Angela,
whether you like it or not.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.590
I'm, um... I'm gonna go
check on my mother-in-law.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.795
<i> Poor kid.
She's been through a lot.</i>

21:15.640 --> 21:18.438
- You liar!
- No, it's true!

21:18.560 --> 21:20.869
- Liar!
- No, it's true!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.514
<i> Come on, Tony. Give him a shot!</i>

21:23.640 --> 21:26.359
Hey! The two of youse knock it of!

21:26.960 --> 21:29.520
All right, stop this fight! What is this?

21:29.640 --> 21:32.359
Tony, get up. Get of. Get up!

21:33.840 --> 21:35.831
Get in the house. Go on, hurry up!

21:37.160 --> 21:40.436
- You all right, Joey?
- My nose is bleeding.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.516
Let me see that.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.756
That's nothing. That's nothing.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.275
- Are you OK?
- Mm.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.392
You two just stay away
from each other today, OK?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.637
Go on.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.718
Thank you so much, Tony.
Thank you so much.

22:01.720 --> 22:06.032
So, Angela... How are you?
How are you holdin up, huh?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.513
I don't know... I'm...

22:07.640 --> 22:09.870
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm OK. Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.515
Now, look...
I wanna reassure you, Angela.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.595
Youre not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna take care of you.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.030
I really appreciate that, Tony.
I really do, but...

22:22.160 --> 22:24.037
Angela...

22:25.240 --> 22:27.754
I wanna help you.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.030
Oh, you're so sweet.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.114
Thanks.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.673
Oh, Angela...

22:40.440 --> 22:43.830
Holy shit! The grieving widow!

22:57.200 --> 22:59.475
Keep your hands of me.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.556
<i> Bingo!</i>

23:14.680 --> 23:16.989
Ma, what are we gonna do now?

23:20.680 --> 23:23.069
I don't know, hon.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.397
<i>I just don't know. </i>

23:32.240 --> 23:36.472
<i>Attention, shoppers! Sprint to
the deli counter, where pizza is on sale</i>

23:37.680 --> 23:40.752
<i>for the next 30 minutes only.</i>

23:44.520 --> 23:46.476
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Angela.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.592
Angela!

23:52.720 --> 23:54.358
Connie.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.630
Weight Watchers, huh?

23:57.680 --> 24:00.069
You worried about your figure?

24:00.880 --> 24:02.871
- Some of us are.
- Cute.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.150
Joan Rivers Junior, huh?

24:06.200 --> 24:10.955
You know, Angela,
sometimes when a girl gets single,

24:11.080 --> 24:14.152
she starts thinking about
goin out with other giris guys.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.840
Connie, I am not interested in Tony.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.477
Everybody is interested in Tony.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.671
You beter call it of, because
if I ever catch you two together...

24:27.440 --> 24:29.396
I... I...

24:40.360 --> 24:41.952
Just forget about it!

24:42.080 --> 24:45.516
Try keepin Tony on a leash!
I think you'll find one in aisle 5!

24:45.720 --> 24:48.917
Oh, yeah? While I'm there,
I'll pick you up a flea collar!

24:49.040 --> 24:50.996
Angela, watch your ass!

24:51.120 --> 24:53.759
- Will that be spiced or regular?
- Spiced.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.757
OK. Comin right up.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.111
Die! Die, earthling!

25:03.880 --> 25:05.632
Joey...

25:05.760 --> 25:08.911
- Where did you get that?
- Uncle Tony gave it to me.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.669
<i>- Uncle Tony?
- He gave me this, too. A $100 bill!</i>

25:15.320 --> 25:18.437
- He bought some stuf for you, too!
- Oh, yeah?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.070
Ta-da!

25:30.120 --> 25:31.792
Die!

25:32.920 --> 25:34.876
Joey, stop it!

25:36.640 --> 25:38.790
What's the mater, Ma?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.434
Joey...

25:44.560 --> 25:48.314
Tony is not your uncle. He's not a relative.

25:48.440 --> 25:52.069
And I don't want you
taking presents from him any more.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.839
Can I keep the Lazer Tag stuf?

25:54.960 --> 25:57.349
No. Sorry.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.276
Run upstairs and do your homework.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.436
OK.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.915
Because I care.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.713
- Your receipts, Mrs de Marco.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.796
Your generosity is overwhelming.

26:48.920 --> 26:53.789
Here - the pink slip to the car, and
the address where to pick it up tonight.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.070
God bless you, Mrs de Marco.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.954
Forget about it. Oh, after tonight...

26:59.080 --> 27:01.640
- Yes?
- Lose that address.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.710
- Ready, big guy?
- Let's go, Mom.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.877
OK. Here we go.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.512
- Mm. Whos the bimbo?
- Angela de Marco.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.191
<i> The former
Miss Angela Maria Gianelli.</i>

27:39.320 --> 27:42.357
Daughter of Dominick and Catherine,
both deceased.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.517
Mother of Joseph Francis, age seven.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.474
Subject graduated
Bayside High School, Queens, 1978.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.832
Atended one semester
Robert René Beauty Academy.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.235
College education - none.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.999
- Favourite vegetable?
- Cucumber.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.633
- Favourite animal?
- Tiger.

28:00.960 --> 28:04.953
What? Cucumber Frank de Marcos
widow is screwing Tony Russo?

28:05.080 --> 28:09.358
- That's what Tonys wife thinks.
- I don't get it. How does Connie fit in?

28:09.480 --> 28:14.873
From my observation, sir, Connie is
the one person who Tony actively fears.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.754
Who knows why,
but it borders on the pathological.

28:19.160 --> 28:24.234
Subject married
Francis Aloysius de Marco, May 15, 1979.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.430
The key is Angela de Marco.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.950
I say we tap her phone, her house,
her bedroom. Stake her out.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.116
Scope her, tail her, coming and going,

28:32.240 --> 28:35.835
and we catch Tony The Tiger
with his pants down.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.520
<i> Not bad, Downey. Get the bitch.</i>

28:52.680 --> 28:55.592
- Why is she stoppin here, Ed?
- I don't know.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.351
<i> OK. Go on in.</i>

29:06.880 --> 29:08.836
<i> Come on.</i>

29:19.160 --> 29:21.230
Mom, we can't live here.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.671
I told you this is all
we can aford right now, Joey.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.756
Things are gonna be tough for a while.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.029
Whoo!

29:30.160 --> 29:34.233
I'm gonna get a good job, we'll save
some money, and we'll find a nicer place.

29:34.360 --> 29:38.273
Were gonna lead a good life that we can
be proud of. That's what maters now.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.960
OK, but this place really sucks.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.312
Yeah, I know. Let's go down
and unload the car, OK?

29:46.920 --> 29:49.639
What's that thing
in the middle of that room?

29:50.840 --> 29:52.398
A bathtub.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.512
- Why is it in the kitchen?
- I'll tell you later.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.270
<i> Happy birthday</i>

29:59.640 --> 30:04.634
To you

30:07.480 --> 30:10.074

- Make a wish!

30:12.960 --> 30:14.916
I got a wish.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.313
<i> Oooh!</i>

30:17.440 --> 30:19.396
Blow out the candles!

30:24.760 --> 30:26.910

30:28.240 --> 30:30.879
Honey, cut the cake. I'll be right back.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.636
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.959
Where did she go?

30:41.080 --> 30:46.518
Tony, she moved into some shithole on
the Lower East Side. Heres the address.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.234
- What the he'lls she doin' there?
- Beats me.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.830
Tony, it's in a hell of a place.
I wouldnt have a dog live there.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.599
- It's falling apart.
- It's that bad.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.109
It's a dangerous neighbourhood.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.519
Did you remember
that orange notebook on the couch?

31:01.640 --> 31:02.834
Mm-hm.

31:02.960 --> 31:07.238
- Ma, I wanna go in that way!
- Joey, I don't... I don't think... OK, OK.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.193
- Mom, don't worry about me.
- OK, OK.

31:10.320 --> 31:14.438
All right, I'm gonna pick you up
right here at three oclock. OK?

31:14.560 --> 31:15.709
Good luck.

<i>Excusez-moi. This is my stop.</i>

What the hell are you doin', dorkface?

32:22.960 --> 32:25.110
Hi! Can I help you with something?

32:25.240 --> 32:27.754
I'm not sure you're the person
I should talk to.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.078
I'm here about your advertisement in the
newspaper, about the cosmetics position.

32:32.200 --> 32:37.558
I'm sorry. They already hired somebody.
Youve got to get here really early.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.673
<i>I'm just a travelling stranger
</i>

32:41.800 --> 32:43.631
On my way...

33:30.680 --> 33:32.830
Hello, sweetie. How are you today?

33:32.960 --> 33:35.599
Oh... I can't find a job.

33:36.320 --> 33:40.518
Go to Chicken Lickin right next door.
They got a sign in the window.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.596
- Right here.
- Yeah?

33:43.920 --> 33:45.478
Thank you.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.477
- You have a good day.
- You too.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.916
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.795
Ive never worked in a restaurant before.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.480
But I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.793
Good.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.958
Let's try this uniform on,
and then we'll see how things look.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.592
OK.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.870
- You can change in here.
- OK.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.956
For privacy.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.310
Furthermore, I'll lock the door.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.875
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.188
<i> Oh!</i>

34:46.080 --> 34:48.036
Oh, shoot.

It's OK.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.548
Oh, miss?

34:59.680 --> 35:02.478
You are a real lowlife, mister.
You know that?

35:03.080 --> 35:06.675
Young lady, one moment.
Maam, please! Please!

35:07.240 --> 35:09.276
Gimme back my uniform!

35:09.400 --> 35:12.198

Yeah. A regular menace to society.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.795
Yeah, well, see you later, pal.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.556

No, I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.880
I found it on the street. I couldn't resist.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.232
You probably want to strip it
before you put any kind of finish on it.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.158
Oh... Oh.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.959

39:07.160 --> 39:09.628
It needs a litle bit of work, Angela.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.116
But, you know...

39:13.240 --> 39:15.754
You fix it up right, itll be great.

39:28.520 --> 39:31.796
<i>You know, Angela,

39:32.840 --> 39:36.276

Gee, Tommy, I'm so busy with the move

<i>Ci vediamo, cara.</i>

Excuse me.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.230

- Hi, Rita. I'm fine.

41:41.840 --> 41:45.355
I'm looking for a job.
I saw your sign in the window.

41:45.480 --> 41:46.515
What can you do?

41:46.640 --> 41:50.110
Well, I went to the, uh...
Robert René Beauty Academy.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.390
Well, I didn't graduate.

41:52.520 --> 41:56.718
But I can clean,
I can answer phones, I do windows.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.238
And I live right across the street.
And, uh...

42:01.040 --> 42:03.349
I'm willing to try anything.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.275
Please give me a chance.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.076
Almost there.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.469
- You like it?
- Yeah, I think so. It's...

42:25.640 --> 42:27.596
Boy, it's short, huh?

42:27.720 --> 42:30.518
- Well, it's a haircut.
- No, I like it. It's...

42:31.520 --> 42:33.954
- I think it's short.
- It looks great on you.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.719
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome. See you tomorrow.

42:36.840 --> 42:39.354
Thank you so much

42:39.480 --> 42:41.869
- You won't be disappointed.
- I hope not.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.719
- Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.
- Thanks, Rita.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.679
Next victim.

42:49.480 --> 42:53.109
Um... Note to myself.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.912
Run a make on the black chick.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.478
Oh, God!

43:09.760 --> 43:11.955
Jeez, you scared me.

43:14.360 --> 43:17.796
- Hey, I thought you lived upstairs.
- I do. I'm a plumber.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.992
I got of on the wrong floor.
They all look the same.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.710
Are you OK?

43:23.840 --> 43:26.308
No. I, uh... Not really. Uh...

43:26.440 --> 43:28.590
Ive got this, uh... flu.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.392
I oughta get to bed.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.910
Listen. Ive got some great
12-hour cold tablets.

43:36.600 --> 43:40.593
- Why don't I get them for you?
- Uh... No! Um...

43:46.360 --> 43:52.196
This is like... a 24-hour bug.
It's very kind of you.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.997
OK.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.308
- You didn't notice my hair.
- Um...

44:01.440 --> 44:03.590
No, I did.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.676
What do you think?

44:06.640 --> 44:08.631
It's a brand-new you.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.910
Thanks... I think.

44:14.040 --> 44:17.032
Take care of yourself.
Drink plenty of fluids.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.720
<i> Thanks for the advice!</i>

44:25.320 --> 44:28.835
<i> Ma, can I stay over
at David's house Friday night?</i>

44:28.960 --> 44:32.350
<i>- I don't know, hon.
- Please. Davids mother will be there.</i>

44:32.480 --> 44:34.471
<i>OK. Friday night will be OK.</i>

44:34.600 --> 44:38.070
Woof, woof, woof.
Promotion in this for the both of us.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.790
I ran into her twice today.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.837
She seems so... nice, Ed.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.359
I just can't figure it out, you know.
The move, this place...

44:51.120 --> 44:53.873
<i>- The job hunt.
- </i>

45:07.280 --> 45:09.191
Hi, Mike.

45:09.320 --> 45:13.996
Here are those... 12-hour cold tablets
I was... You know, just in case.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.315
Jeez, um...

45:16.440 --> 45:20.274
I feel beter already. Must have
just been a six-hour bug. But thanks.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.798
Mike, would you like
to go out on a date with me?

45:25.040 --> 45:27.110
You know, if you want to.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.791
You know, just dinner or, uh...

45:32.080 --> 45:34.036
Uh, yeah. Sure.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.156
Great!

45:38.280 --> 45:39.838
Um...

45:39.960 --> 45:42.315
How about Friday night?

45:44.160 --> 45:46.515
Friday night sounds great.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.073
- Great!
- Hey, Ma!

45:48.200 --> 45:51.158
- Hey! Howd you know where I was?
- I followed your voice.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.750
Some detective!

45:53.880 --> 45:55.996
Mike, this is my son Joey.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.553
- Hiya, Joey.
- Hi.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.035
Mom, did the cavemen
kill all the dinosaurs?

46:00.160 --> 46:04.676
Gee, hon... I don't know.
It's... a litle before my time.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.073
Actually, Joey,

46:08.200 --> 46:11.909
the dinosaurs were dead millions
of years before humans showed up.

46:12.040 --> 46:16.431
In fact, if the worid were 24 hours old,

46:16.560 --> 46:19.358
the dinosaurs would
have lived in the last hour,

46:19.480 --> 46:24.952
and the humans would have lived
less than two seconds of that 24th hour.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.230
Mike, you blow my mind.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.918
Hey, big guy,
have you started your homework?

46:31.040 --> 46:32.951
- No.
- I didn't think so.

46:33.080 --> 46:37.756
Why don't you run down and start your
homework? I'll be down in a few minutes.

46:39.920 --> 46:44.038
Youre really good with kids. Do you
have any? Youre not married, are you?

46:44.160 --> 46:48.870
Angela, if I were married,
would I accept a date with you?

46:49.360 --> 46:53.876
No, I guess not. Neither am I.
Well, I was, but he's dead.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.115
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. Dont be.

46:58.520 --> 47:01.398
Well, I'll get outa your hair.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.399
- So, uh, I'll see you Friday night.
- See you there.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.914
- OK. About eight?
- Eight o'clock.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.396
OK.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.476
- Bye.
- Bye.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.316
<i> Bingo!</i>

47:56.040 --> 47:59.350
- Prety wild, huh?
- It's very nice.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.677
This is some kind of punch.
I can't pronounce the name.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.631
What shall we toast?

48:04.760 --> 48:08.389
Oh, I know. Here's to elevators.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.636
You meet the nicest people in them.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.710
So where to?

48:42.840 --> 48:46.549
<i>- Well, I could use a little snack.
- The usual?</i>

48:46.680 --> 48:49.911
You read my mind.
Tell the boys behind us.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.996
All right.

48:54.760 --> 48:55.317
Hello.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.352
<i>- Are you hungry, boys?
- I thought you'd never ask.</i>

48:58.480 --> 49:00.596
Good. Were going to Burger Worid.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.592
- Alka-Seltzer Worid.
- You don't like Burger Worid?

49:06.040 --> 49:08.679
Drive up to the clown

49:09.160 --> 49:11.037
It's a Burger Worid town

49:11.160 --> 49:13.549
We-bee-de, we-dee-de-de-de

49:14.120 --> 49:17.396
The fries are crispy,
the shakes are creamy

49:17.520 --> 49:21.308
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

49:21.760 --> 49:24.911
Charred, roting flesh
aint my idea of a good meal.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.439
Jeez, Vinnie...

49:39.880 --> 49:41.711
Oh, shit! Butch!

49:54.080 --> 49:56.992
<i>
It's a Burger Worid town</i>

50:19.560 --> 50:21.949
No! No! My feet!

50:38.200 --> 50:42.034
<i>Bonjour! 'Hola! Willkommen! 'Howdy!
May I take your order?</i>

50:42.160 --> 50:47.188
Yeah, I'd like two Double Continental
cheeseburgers and, uh... two fries.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.798
<i>- Two chocolate shakes.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.315

- Oh, yeah. Rings.

50:59.920 --> 51:03.959
Could you add on, please,
two orders of onion rings?

51:04.080 --> 51:06.036
<i>You bet.</i>

51:21.040 --> 51:23.429
That'll be $8.20, gentlemen.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.997
Take out for the car in back of us.
Keep $5 for yourself.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.509
- Thanks very much.
- And extra ketchup!

51:30.640 --> 51:32.596
You got it.

51:34.200 --> 51:36.395
That's a new clown.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.148
- Tommy, let's get the fuck outa here!
- Dont.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.236
The clown.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.153
I don't care if you have to
send fuckin telegrams.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.794
Some clown just tried to kill me.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.151
<i>I want a sit-down in Miami in 36 hours.
I want mediation.</i>

53:01.280 --> 53:04.556
Were gonna setle this bullshit
once and for all.

53:14.120 --> 53:18.033
Once you have found him,
never let him go, hey!

53:18.280 --> 53:21.989
Once you have found him,
never let him go, hey!

53:22.240 --> 53:26.518
<i>Once you have found him,
never let him go </i>

53:28.360 --> 53:30.590
Oh!

53:37.960 --> 53:39.996
So, uh... what are you drinkin?

53:42.120 --> 53:45.157
- What've you got?
- Not a lot. Uh...

53:45.800 --> 53:50.874
Well, you have a choice of Café Lolita,
or tequila, or crème de menthe.

53:54.280 --> 53:56.191
You don't happen to have a club soda?

53:58.320 --> 54:02.359
Yeah. It's in the fridge.
Um... You wanna get it?

54:03.200 --> 54:05.475
I'll be right back.

54:07.560 --> 54:09.516
Night, Lucky.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.678
- I see you found everything.
- No problem.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.553
Why don't you take your coat of
and stay a while?

54:37.680 --> 54:40.035
Sounds like a fantastic idea.

54:43.520 --> 54:47.069
- Once you have found him
- Never let him go

54:51.920 --> 54:56.550
I really... I really liked that band.
Their music is kinda strange. I like it.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.110
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.711
This is really good club soda.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.431
Would you rub my feet?
They're killing me.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.516
Um...

55:33.760 --> 55:36.991
I think I, uh...
I'm actually prety good at this.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.999
Yeah?

55:39.640 --> 55:42.712
I just gota get ahold of
one of these nerves in here...

55:44.800 --> 55:46.916
Ooh! Ow!

Oh, God...

56:04.520 --> 56:05.714
Oh...

56:09.240 --> 56:11.879
Oh, God! Dont stop. That feels great.

56:12.800 --> 56:16.713
I can't remember the last time
a man touched me below the waist.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.835
<i>- I can't believe I said that.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.359
Mike, I'm sorry...

56:22.480 --> 56:23.959
<i>- Whoa!

56:24.080 --> 56:26.992
<i>- Hey!

56:29.160 --> 56:32.391
- I'll just, uh... use the bathroom.
- It's right there.

56:32.520 --> 56:37.071
- You must think I'm so crude.
- Are you kidding? It's just club soda.

56:46.960 --> 56:48.916

- Connie, Tony is not here.

57:05.520 --> 57:06.475

57:18.640 --> 57:20.870

What do you call these?

57:23.600 --> 57:26.672

57:26.800 --> 57:28.870
Your hair looks like shit!

57:31.440 --> 57:34.193

57:34.320 --> 57:36.390
Connie, you're making a big mistake.

57:36.520 --> 57:37.555
Tony!

57:42.480 --> 57:44.152

57:45.440 --> 57:49.752
This is my neighbour Mike.
This is my friend... Connie.

57:57.800 --> 58:00.997
Gee, I, uh, don't know.
Whose husband are you lookin for?

58:05.600 --> 58:07.556

- Oh.

58:08.480 --> 58:12.189
- I guess I got you on the wrong night.
- Get out! And stay out of my life!

58:12.320 --> 58:15.676
Look, I fight for what's mine.
I make no apologies.

58:15.800 --> 58:19.395
You can call me a ball-buster,
but it's just the way I am!

58:20.440 --> 58:22.590
Keep away from Tony!

58:46.360 --> 58:48.316
You all right?

58:51.000 --> 58:52.956
It doesn't mater.

58:53.760 --> 58:56.593
What the hell was I thinkin?
I'm such a jerk.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.194
I thought I could start a new life.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.470
Gave away everything we had.

59:06.480 --> 59:10.359
Cut all our ties to the past.
Dragged Joey away from all his friends.

59:12.160 --> 59:15.152
Be good - look where it got us.
All for nothing.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.430
We'll never get away from them.

59:19.920 --> 59:22.434
And the funniest part of all...

59:22.560 --> 59:25.916
I wasn't even thinkin' of guys,
and then I meet you and...

59:31.800 --> 59:35.952
If you knew what I...
what I thought about us and...

59:38.760 --> 59:40.910
That's prety pathetic.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.749
I mean, let's face it.
They're never gonna leave me alone.

59:49.480 --> 59:51.436
The ball-buster...

59:52.800 --> 59:55.155
is Mrs Tony Russo.

59:57.040 --> 59:59.554
Recognise the name?
The Russo crime family?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.513
Well, my husband worked for Tony.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.748
And he was iced.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.152
And Tonys been trying
to screw me ever since.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.910
So... God, I hate them.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.431
Um...

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.073
Jeez...

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.714
I really, uh... misjudged you.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.156
I'm sorry.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.155
It was nice knowing you.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.914
Bye.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.796
Angela.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.150
I, uh...

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.709
Hey.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.150
- Ive got some things I have to say to you.
- You do, huh?

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.196
Goddamn it!

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.358
It's not easy to turn your life around.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.393
Especially when your past
keeps coming back to haunt you.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.080
What makes you so smart?

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.473
Well, I, uh... guess I know you
beter than you think I do.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.396
Oh, yeah?

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.998
Yeah.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.911
We all make mistakes.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.068
The important thing is to realise it
and to do something about it.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.230
And to let yourself of the hook,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.511
because everybody
deserves a second chance.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.236
They do?

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.275
Especially someone like you.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.717
That's the nicest thing
anyones ever said to me.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.878
<i>
- Let's go, Mike!</i>

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.431
Open up, Romeo!

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.358
- Whos that?
- That's my... friend. I gota get to work.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.436
- Your friend?
- I'll call you later!

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.518
- Mike, is everything OK?
- Yeah, everythings fine.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.552
Wakey, wakey! Eggs and bacie!
Let's get goin'!

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.635
- Ed!
- Ah!

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.355
- How long we been on the Russo case?
- 14 months. Next question?

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.756
- When did you last play hide the salami?
- Classified. Next?

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.236
- Utilise a fun bag?
- Back of. Classified. Next question?

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.397
14 months down the tubes
because your sausage gets lonely.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.069
Negative. We treed the wrong possum.
Angela's innocent.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.198
I don't know about you any more,
Downey. I just don't know.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.437
Your brains on hold.
Youre thinking with your dick.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.916
Maybe you're burned out. Fried.
In over your head.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.150
Maybe you need a vacation.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.196
Maybe not.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.069
I don't know, Downey.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.760
I just don't... know.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.239
Three words, gentlemen: Get Tony Russo.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.073
<i>4.30... Tuesday. Rita.</i>

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.316
You got it. OK, bye-bye.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.514
<i>
- Hello, gorg...</i>

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.394
- Angela de Marco?
- Yeah.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.114
FBI. You wanna come downtown with us?

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.913
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Rita Harcourt?

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.830
Immigration and Naturalization.
You gota come downtown with me.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.392
Who the hell you think you is,
tellin us to come downtown?

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.556
Mike, what are you doing here?

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.274
Angela, you'd, uh... beter sit down.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.354
Mrs de Marco,
I'm Regional Director Franklin.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.508
This is Special Agent Benitez.
You already know Special Agent Downey.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.231
Downey?

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.316
Youre FBI?

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.439
Weve had you
under surveillance for some time.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.553
Surveillance? Is that what you call it?
Surveillance for what?

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.196
- For starters, traficking in stolen goods.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.908
You donated quite a bit of furniture
to charity. Very generous.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.636
- Unfortunately, most of it was hot.
- Oh... Gimme a break!

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.830
That's three to five years, Angela.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.916
I also have a report from the IRS.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.669
Something about undeclared income
and defrauding the government.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.394
That's an additional 10 to 15
in a federal pen.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.798
- Frankie always took care of the taxes.
- You signed the returns.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.398
Then theres the mater of your husbands
death. We know who killed him.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.033
Tony?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.034
And we know who helped.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.310
What is this? Where did you get this?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.715
Youre in deep shit, Angela.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.276
And sos your friend.
She's being deported.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.949
She'll be under a palm tree
opening coconuts by the end of the week.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.270
You sleazy sons of bitches.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.071
- Unless you play ball.
- You people work just like the Mob!

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.909
- Theres no diference!
- Theres a big diference, Mrs de Marco.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.476
The Mob is run by murdering,
lying, cheating psychopaths.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.036
We work for the President
of the United States of America.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.869
- Go to hell.
- Let's stop playing games, Angela.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.509
We can have you arrested and put in jail.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.519
You'll be declared an unfit mother,
and Joey will end up in a foster home.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.200
- Hold it, Franklin!
- Shut up, Downey!

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.676
- You can't... you can't do that.
- Just you watch us.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.515
The meeting is all set.
Everyone is gonna be there.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.598
I'm havin' a travel agent
bring over the tickets.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.157
I'm handling the security myself.
I don't see any problems.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.149
That's real good, Uncle Joe.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.832
Oh, by the way, theres a, uh...
Mrs de Marco waitin to see you.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.555
- She's here now?
- Yeah.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.592
- Well, have her come in, Uncle Joe.
- Right.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.832
Hey, fellas.
Evaporate for five minutes, will ya?

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.916
You got it, boss.

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.236
- Angela.
- Hi.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.634
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.236
Come on, sit down.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.669
- It's terrible about Tommy.
- Yeah.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.830
Yeah, first it was Frankie,
and now Tommy.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.711
Hows Rosie taking it?

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.553
Rosie took a months supply of Valium
this morning. She's at Mercy Hospital.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.636
Oh, God...

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:03.794
<i>Frankly, I'm a litle surprised you're here.</i>

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.069
Yeah. I know.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.996
Um...

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.109
I don't know. When I saw
the newspaper this morning,

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.758
all these feelings came over me and...

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.270
You know, I just...
I just feel really lost and...

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.357
well, you know, I just, uh...
I wanted to see you.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.359
Get outa here.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.993
You really scared me
the day of the funeral.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.078
You don't realise the efect
you have on a woman.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.555
Youre a very powerful guy, Tony.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.395
Dont bullshit me, Angela.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.270
You don't get it, do you?
Well, I didn't expect you to.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.430
- I'll see you around.
- Hold it right there.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.913
What?

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.596
Are you bein straight with me?

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.912
No, I came all the way out here
just to pull your chain.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.952
Well, you know something?
I almost believe you.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.639
Heres your itinerary, Anthony. Youre...

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.557
Youre goin out on Eastern. 8am.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.070
Thank you, Uncle Joe.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.670
Where you goin?

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.559
Miami.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.435
- Bye, Mom!
- Love you!

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.593
Tony! Tony! Tone!

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.831
<i> Boarding flight 17,
nonstop service to Miami, gate 32.</i>

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.154
Yeah, that's it. All right,
we got a minute. Let's park it here.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.950
I'll double-check the tickets.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.709
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Oh, OK. Yeah, you got time.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.435
- Have a safe trip, miss!
- Thank you.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.388
Leave me alone!

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.638
Holy shit! Nick!

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.469
- I'm way ahead of you, boss.
- I don't believe this one!

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.875
- Connie!
- Thank God I got here in time!

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.436
- What's wrong, huh?
- You forgot to say goodbye to me!

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.599
- You forgot to say goodbye to me, baby!
- Oh! You were fast asleep.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.678
- I kissed you goodbye.
- You should have woken me up.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.793
Baby, I know Ive been hard on you lately,
but I had this awful dream,

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.673
and I realised Ive been awfully selfish.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.392
Nah, come on...

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.195
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Eastern Airlines flight 17,</i>

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.235
<i>nonstop to Miami, is now boarding
at gate 1 for rows 1 through 5.</i>

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.192
- Please forgive me, baby!
- Dont be silly, Connie.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.595
No, no. Ive got a confessión to make.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.915
Angela! Come on.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.079
The other night when you didn't come
home on time, I got a litle suspicious.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.591
- I'm so ashamed. I went to Angela's.
- You went to Angela's?

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.871
I couldn't help it, baby.
I had to see if you were with her.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.070
Just thinkin about you with that slut,

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.352
I just... I got... I went crazy!
I couldn't stand it!

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.199
Tony, if I had found you
banging that broad,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.153
I woulda hunted you down like an animal.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.716
It would have been slow and painful.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.229
You would have begged me
for mercy, baby.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.316
- I was so far gone...
- Connie...

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.670
Youre talkin crazy.
I gota get on the plane.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.113
The point is, I'm so ashamed, baby, for
not trusting you, is what I'm trying to say.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.992
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with!

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.076
- What schmuck?
- Just some schmuck!

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.350
Come on. Get on your plane.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.919
Boy, she didn't waste any time, did she?

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.508
- Get on the plane, you maniac!
- Yeah, OK.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.393
Tone! I'm gonna be the best wife to you.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.474
OK, honey. See you.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.238
OK. Bye-bye.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.756
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.278
I hope that didn't shake you up

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.755
- No. I'm OK.
- Good.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.480
- Champagne, sir?
- Thank you.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.836
Heres to, uh...

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.360
Heres to the mystery of life.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.358
We have a lot to learn
about each other, Angela.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.875
Hello, front desk. How are you, honey?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.356
Beautiful. You have a reservation
for Mr Anthony Russo?

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.916
Beautiful again. This is Mrs Russo.
I'm gonna join my husband.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.157
Listen. I want you to move us
into the honeymoon suite.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.999
Now, I want champagne. I want caviar.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.634
I want flowers.
I want the room to swim in flowers.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.558
And I wonder if you could...
Excuse me, honey?

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.959
<i>He already has the honeymoon suite?</i>

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.672
- We have a flight leaving in 45 minutes...
- Just gimme the fuckin' ticket, dickhead.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.238

Oh, look. A piano bar...

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.110
- Is something wrong?
- No.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.916
No, nothings wrong.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.150
Are you sure?

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.236
Um...

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.036
A regular menace to society.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.556
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.476
- Hi, boss.
- Yo, boss.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.556
Stevarino, Al. I wanna talk to you.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.148
- Angela, I'll be right with you.
- OK.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.553
<i> Somebody tell me
what's been happening to me lately...</i>

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.394
- Can I get you a drink, sir?
- Yeah, club soda. Thanks.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.588
Hello, Mama. Homeboy. Target skybound.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.429
Remember - look, but don't touch.
Youre the eyes, we're the brains.

Dont make a move without my say-so.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.028

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.956

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.793

I can see you're on your own

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.312
- Hey, what's your name anyway?

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.474
If I could buy my Uncle Nick

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.037
<i>and then sell him for what he thinks
he's worth, I'd be a billionaire!</i>

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.593
I'll give him a beatin.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.116

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.991
<i> Wow!</i>

Meetings in one hour, boss.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.513
Get New York on the horn
for me, Stevarino.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.675
Right away.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.268
Huh? Huh?

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.789
Huh? Huh?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.072
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to welcome you to Miami.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.432
The captain has asked that you remain
in your seats until we reach the terminal.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.676
Madam, please!

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.831
Honey, forget about it.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.594
Got something for you.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.676
Open it up.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.679
Oh, Tony, it's beautiful.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.597
Well...

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.838
I thought you deserved
something real special.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.436
So do you, Tone.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.357
- What's that? For me?
- Yeah.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.436
You litle devil!

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.431
Your hands are trembling.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.915
I'm scared shitless, Tony.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.234
I didn't expect this of you, Angela.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.638
It's magnificent.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.069
- You like it?
- Like it?

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.668
Like it? Are you kiddin? Here, put it on.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.232
Look at that! Look!
Look how it picks up the light.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.839
Yeah.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.956
That's not all it picks up, Tony.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.435
Grand jury time, Tony.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.557
Director Franklin, Jimmy Fisheggs
just arrived. The gondola.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.671
Clear, Renée.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.678
Mr James Roe.
The partys shapin up nicely.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.998
Come on, Tony. Get your ass into gear
and get over here.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.029
- Stevarino, I'll get it.
- OK, boss.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.476
Come on in, fellas.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.472
- Whos your friend?
- Tony, meet Mike Smith.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.558
A lonely guy from Dubuque. A great guy.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.513
A one-man party
in search of the right crowd.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.315
- I knew you guys had to meet.
- You did the right thing, Nick.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:03.356
It's fabulous to meet you, Mr Smith. Great
to hook up with another party animal.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:07.234
I think it's Nick and Al here
who are the real animals!

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.558
What the hell is he up to now?

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.753
<i>- I admire your moustache.
- Well, thank you very much. </i>

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.711
- Angela?
- Yeah?

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.796
Come over here and meet
Mike Smith from Doobook.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.791
Hi. I'm Mike Smith from Dubuque.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.675
- Hello, Mr Smith.
- It's fabulous to meet you, Angela.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.588
<i>- Thank you.
- It's fabulous to meet all of you! </i>

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.631
Let's take a seat, Mike.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.876
- Come on!
- Thanks.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.390
- Sit down, Mr Smith.
- OK.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.916
Jeez, uh...

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.678
It's a wild spread you got here.
Hey, I realise you're busy. I'll, uh...

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.514
Agh!

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.596
Fellas.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.115
Frisk him, Stevarino.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.435
- Watch him, Nick.
- You got it, Steve.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.992
Hold it, hold it!

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.271
Make another move
and I'll blow your brains out.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.270
Well, looky here, boss. Only a lighter.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.590
<i> How very interesting.</i>

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.870
Tony?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.115
Um...

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.639
You know, hon...

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.834
This is none of my business. I totally
don't even know what's going on here.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.315
But I think it's geting a litle out of hand.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.034
You beter stay out of this, miss.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.515
Check out this here.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.798
- Who the fuck are you?
- Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tony.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.596
Youre all under arrest. If you got
about 14 hours, I'll read you the charges.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.070
I can see the headlines in the morning.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.397
FBI hothead shoots love-nest girlfriend.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.829
- What the...?
- Freeze!

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.839
Freeze. Any of youse move
and I'll blow his fucking head of!

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.872
Go ahead.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.879
- I'm not kidding, Tony!
- It's all over, Tony!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.834
The place is crawling with cops!
FBI, DEA, Treasury!

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.271
- Angela.
- What?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.190
Be careful. Very, very careful.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.994
<i>- Dont!
- OK. OK. OK.</i>

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.515
Angela, you're a very excitin woman.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.119
For some crazy reason, I think
I'd rather kill myself than hurt you.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.038
- But suicides out of the question.
- Oh, yeah?

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.109
Just like you hurt my husband? Just like
you killed Frankie, you lying bastard?

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.480
Boss, is that bitch tellin the truth?

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.512
- Chill out. Chill out!
- That's right, buddies.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.189
Tell em, Tony! Say it loud and clear
so we can get it on tape!

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.756
The whole place is bugged.
The chairs, the lamps, the paintings!

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.792
Any second now, 50 agents
are gonna pound at that door!

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.956
<i>- Ah, bullshit.
- </i>

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.512
That's it, Tony.
You have the right to remain silent.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.598
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.109
<i>- Shut the fuck up, fuzzball!
- </i>

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.278
- I'll get it.
- You have the right to an atorney.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.278
Angela, stay...!
Get your dicks out of your hands, guys!

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.356
If you cannot aford an atorney...

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.438
- Mike, it's your old buddy Al...
- Shut up!

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.077
Agh! Connie!

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.959
Con?

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.837
Oh, my God! Tony, it's Connie!

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.478
Why are you here, dorkface?

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.275
I came to tell your husband
to keep his hands of of my woman!

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.837
Connie, don't listen to him. He's a cop.
And Angela is workin with him.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.508
Honeymoon suite...

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.592
Connie, look. She gave me a ring, see?

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:24.078
But it's got a bug in it, Connie. A bug! Can
you believe that? How about that shit?

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.915
I got nothin to live for any more, Tone.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.559
Of course you do. That's ridiculous.
Think of Tony Junior!

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.796
All your credit cards, honey...

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.358
All right, Connie. Let's think.
You got your game shows, honey!

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.436
<i>You got, uh... Wheel of Fame!</i>

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.670
Agh!

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.548
Connie, that was... that was close.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.196
Watch your back, Uncle Nick!

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.679
Take him out!

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.509
You...

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.319
Gee, Mike. You didn't have to do that.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.636
Now, Connie...

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.589
Connie, honey, I'm gonna change.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.075
You certainly will.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.995
FBI! Drop it, Connie!

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.716
- Hold it, Tony!
- Screw you!

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.876
- Fuck!
- Tony Russo,

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.951
you're under arrest for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.389
You'll never make it stick.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.670
- Sure, Tony.
- Come on, boys.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.039
- Tony, what did you tell them?
- I'm sorry. I can't talk about it.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.312
- How are the Feds treatin you?
- Not bad. I get to watch all my soaps.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.072
The food must be good.
You put on some weight.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.158
<i>- It's probably the bulletproof vest.
- </i>

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.794
Are you afraid someone
will knock you of?

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.037
Afraid? With these gorillas around me,

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.869
I feel safer than a virgin
at a eunuch convention.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.028
Say, Robert. Excuse me. Would you mind
if I stepped in and took a leak?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.355
- Go ahead.
- Youre a gentleman.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.236
Oh, the fries are crispy,
the shakes are creamy

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.190
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.550
It's a Burger Worid town

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.557
Hiya, Tone.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.399
Connie?

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.032
Kiss it goodbye!

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.237
No...

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.715
Holy Mary, mother of God!

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.432
Oh, shit!

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.070
- Another bad dream, huh?
- Uh, yeah. I guess you could say that.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.795
Time to get up anyway.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.595
Todays your big day.
Cant keep the grand jury waitin.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.669
Angela, you are an artist!

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.070
- Great. You like it?
- I love it.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.228
Here. You keep the change on this, OK?

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.316
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.991
Next victim!

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.710
<i>- Hello, Gorgeous.
- 'Hello, gorgeous. 'Hi.</i>

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.236
<i>- Oh, it's you.
- Listen, please don't hang up again.</i>

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.476
<i>Angela, look out the window.
Look across the street.</i>

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.991
- Give me a break. What do you want?
- Uh... A haircut?

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.111
- Boy, you don't give up too easy, Mike.
- Not when it come to you, Angela.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.756
Sure. I suppose I could squeeze you in.

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.948
I see your arm is all healed. Lay back.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.118
OK.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.719
Uh...

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.638
You know, Angela... Ive been thinking...

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.833
Mm. Well, there you go.
Workin without tools again.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.474
You know, Ive been thinking, too.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.556
You know...

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.196
I fell for you like a ton of bricks.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.076
I bared my soul to you.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.078
I trusted you. You lied to me.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.919
Then... you almost had me killed.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.796
But...

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.876
I can't stop thinkin' about...

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.598
what you said to me
that night at my apartment.

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.555
Maybe everyone does
deserve a second chance.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.272
Ow!

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.356
Even you.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.876
You want one?

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.670
Yeah. I want one.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.070
I'll think about it.
