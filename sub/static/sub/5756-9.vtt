WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:04.203
<i> PREVIOUSLY</i>
<i> ON</i> PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.205 --> 00:05.471
WE'RE HAVING A LOOK
IN TOBY'S LOCKER.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.140
WHY, DO YOU THINK
HE'S HIDING IN THERE?

00:08.142 --> 00:10.743
SO, WHERE IS TOBY NOW?
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:10.745 --> 00:13.445
SOMEONE MADE A COPY
OF ALISON'S BRACELET.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.814
YEAH, AND MADE SURE
THAT WE WOULD FIND IT.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.649
LET'S GET REAL.
IN THEORY,

00:17.651 --> 00:20.386
WE ARE A LOT MORE WRONG
THAN WE ARE RIGHT.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.288
I DON'T REMEMBER DOING ANYTHING
TO GET YOU THIS MAD AT ME.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.290
YOU... YOU'RE GREAT.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.659
ALISON WAS JUST
STRAIGHT UP EVIL.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.262
YOU PUT SOMETHING ONLINE,
SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE'S
WILLING TO BUY IT.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.631
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THIS, LUCAS.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.100
THAT CORNER OF THE PARK
IS GOING TO BE A SAFE PLACE

00:35.102 --> 00:37.469
<i> WHERE YOU CAN GO AND SIT</i>
<i> AND JUST THINK.</i>

00:37.471 --> 00:39.104
<i> YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT ALISON</i>
<i> WHILE YOU'RE THERE.</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:41.140
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE THERE?

00:41.142 --> 00:42.708
ARE YOU MOVING OUT?

00:42.710 --> 00:45.110
<i> I WOULD NEVER DO THAT</i>
<i> TO YOU OR YOUR BROTHER.</i>

00:45.112 --> 00:47.346
ALISON TOLD ME HOW YOU
EVEN THREATENED TOBY

00:47.348 --> 00:48.447
IF HE TOLD THE TRUTH.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.349
SHE SAID SHE WAS
AFRAID OF YOU.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.717
IS THAT WHY ONE OF YOU
DID WHAT YOU DID?

00:57.091 --> 00:59.058
THIS IS INSANE.
HOW MANY WORDS

00:59.060 --> 01:01.827
DO THEY EXPECT
YOU TO LEARN
IN ONE NIGHT?

01:01.829 --> 01:03.162
STRINGENT.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.663
UH, TOUGH.
INFLEXIBLE.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.665
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA ACTUALLY USE 'EM.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.333
MERETRICIOUS.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.536
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU GO TO COLLEGE

01:10.538 --> 01:12.905
AND YOU JUST START
SPEAKING A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.139
IT'S ABOUT GETTING
INTO COLLEGE.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.742
MERETRICIOUS, UM,
PHONY, FLASHY?

01:16.744 --> 01:17.976
MM-HMM.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.512
OH, HANNA, WHY ARE
YOU STILL EATING THAT?

01:20.514 --> 01:21.780
'CAUSE IT'S HERE.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.315
PUT IT IN THE GARBAGE.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.084
THEN I'D HAVE TO STAND
OVER THE GARBAGE AND EAT IT.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.885
BESOTTED.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.222
INFATUATED, ENAMORED,
IN LOVE WITH.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.558
HEY, WHAT DID
NOEL KAHN SAY TO YOU
AFTER THE MEMORIAL?

01:32.560 --> 01:35.260
HELLO, WE ARE
TAKING THE S.A.T.s
IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.728
CAN WE FOCUS?
OKAY, SPENCER,

01:36.730 --> 01:38.997
YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW
ANY MORE BIG WORDS.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.866
YOU'RE ALREADY SCARY ENOUGH
TO ANYONE UNDER 50.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.368
I'M NOT SCARY!
AM I SCARY?

01:43.370 --> 01:45.170
A LITTLE.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.172
HEY, I SAW
NOEL KAHN HUG YOU,

01:47.174 --> 01:49.308
AND HE DID NOT
WANNA LET GO.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.977
TALK ABOUT NOT WANTING
TO LET SOMETHING GO.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.645
WHY CAN'T YOU
GIVE HIM A CHANCE?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.347
HE'S SMART, HE'S CUTE,

01:55.349 --> 01:57.483
HIS DAD OWNS, LIKE,
HALF OF RHODE ISLAND,

01:57.485 --> 01:59.485
AND HE'S GOT GREAT LIPS.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.619
HIS FATHER?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.521
NO. EW.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.156
SERIOUSLY, ARIA,
YOU AND NOEL

02:04.158 --> 02:06.492
WOULD LOOK
AMAZING TOGETHER.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.993
CAN WE JUST DROP IT, PLEASE?

02:07.995 --> 02:10.329
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING
MORE THAN A FRIEND.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.532
WHY? DON'T YOU HAVE
ENOUGH ON FACEBOOK?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.767
BESIDES, DON'T YOU
WANT SOMEONE REAL,

02:15.769 --> 02:18.871
SOMEONE YOU CAN, I DON'T
KNOW, SCRATCH AND SNIFF?

02:18.873 --> 02:21.740
WOW. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
EAT THAT OVER THE GARBAGE.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.443
LOOK, I AM TRYING TO
HELP OUT A FRIEND HERE.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.278
WE DON'T ALL HAVE
SMOKING HOT BALL BOYS

02:26.280 --> 02:27.546
FROM THE COUNTRY CLUB.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.848
Aria: WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU AND ALEX?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.717
IS HE BACK
FROM THAT TOURNAMENT?

02:31.719 --> 02:33.685
YEAH. HE'S BACK.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.187
AND?

02:35.189 --> 02:37.556
AND IT'S... GOOD.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.960
IT'S SO GOOD.

02:41.962 --> 02:45.430
I WANT IT TO LAST, BUT I'M
AFRAID I'M GONNA BLOW IT.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.900
SO, WHEN CAN WE OFFICIALLY
CALL HIM THE BOYFRIEND?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.604
HI, MOM.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.839
HEY, MRS. HASTINGS.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.475
HI, GIRLS.
OH, WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.943
GARLIC BREAD.
WANT SOME?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.945
I CAN'T.
GOD, I MISS FOOD.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.146
EAT SOME BUTTER
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.783
WHY DO I HAVE
SO MANY MESSAGES?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.718
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK ALEX TO--

03:06.720 --> 03:08.287
Stop. Not now.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.888
Your mom still
doesn't know?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.590
Like I said,
I want it to last.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.392
WHERE'S EMILY?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.727
SHE'S PROBABLY
ON HER WAY OVER.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.629
( thunder rumbles )

03:36.183 --> 03:37.916
( phone ringing )

03:51.932 --> 03:53.165
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

03:53.167 --> 03:54.733
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

03:54.735 --> 03:56.768
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

03:56.770 --> 03:59.304
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

03:59.306 --> 04:01.974
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

04:01.976 --> 04:04.176
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

04:04.178 --> 04:07.279
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

04:07.281 --> 04:09.414
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:09.416 --> 04:11.350
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:14.288 --> 04:16.955
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME
INSIDE, MOM.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.124
IF IT WERE CANCELLED,
NOBODY WOULD BE HERE.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.492
OH, EXCUSE ME. HI.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.361
ARE THEY ACTUALLY GONNA
GIVE THIS TEST TODAY?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.629
DECISION HASN'T
BEEN MADE YET.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.631
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO MAKES THAT DECISION?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.732
THEY'RE PREDICTING
A MAJOR STORM.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.136
YOU DIDN'T SAY ALEX
WAS TAKING THE TEST HERE, TOO.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.675
WHY DO YOU THINK I WANTED
MY MOM TO DROP US OFF AND LEAVE?

04:36.677 --> 04:37.743
HEY, YOU.
HI.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.816
Spence...

04:44.818 --> 04:47.252
NOBODY HERE CAN MAKE
A DECISION TO SAVE THEIR LIFE.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.388
IT'S ABSURD.
UM, MOM?

04:49.390 --> 04:52.024
THIS IS ALEX SANTIAGO.

04:52.026 --> 04:55.661
ALEX, THIS IS MY MOTHER.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.696
ALEX, THAT I WENT
TO HOMECOMING WITH?

04:57.698 --> 05:01.033
OF COURSE.
HI. FROM THE CLUB.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.235
YEAH.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.204
IT JUST TOOK ME A MOMENT
TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.141
SO, YOU'RE ALEX.

05:09.143 --> 05:12.244
LISTEN, UH,
I NEED TO CHECK IN.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.847
UM, NICE SEEING YOU.
MEETING YOU.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.949
TEST IS ON TODAY.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.419
ROSEWOOD STUDENTS SHOULD
REGISTER IN THE LIBRARY.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.187
BUT, LIKE, HALF THE SCHOOL
ISN'T HERE YET.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.522
AND MAY NEVER MAKE IT.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.724
WE SAW THIS HUGE TREE
DOWN ON SAWMILL ROAD,

05:25.726 --> 05:27.326
AND THEY'VE ALREADY
CLOSED OFF YORK STREET.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.994
THAT WASN'T BECAUSE
OF A TREE.

05:28.996 --> 05:33.565
YORK STREET'S BEEN CLOSED
SINCE LAST NIGHT.
WHY?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.133
SOMEBODY DECIDED
TO PAY A VISIT

05:35.135 --> 05:37.703
TO ALISON DI LAURENTIS'S
MEMORIAL AND DESTROY IT.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.738
SHATTERED THE TILES,
BROKE THE BENCH.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.972
W-WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

05:40.974 --> 05:42.708
WE HAD TO CORDON
OFF THE AREA,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.142
GIVEN IT'S AN ONGOING
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.610
MAYBE YOU CAN SPARE
THEM THE DETAILS.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.379
THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE
THEIR S.A.T.s.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.414
RIGHT. GOOD LUCK
ON THE TEST, LADIES.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.484
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET
TO THE LIBRARY.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.792
GIVE ME A SEC,
WOULD YOU?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.600
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM TOBY, HUH?

06:08.602 --> 06:09.768
NO.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.203
WELL, LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU DO.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.071
ALISON'S MEMORIAL WAS
VANDALIZED LAST NIGHT.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.008
AND TOBY WAS SPOTTED
AT A GAS STATION

06:17.010 --> 06:18.944
JUST OFF THE INTERSTATE
A FEW DAYS AGO,

06:18.946 --> 06:20.112
SO CLEARLY
HE'S STILL WITH US.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.719
BUT WHY WOULD
HE RUN AWAY

06:27.721 --> 06:29.221
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO HIDE?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.423
ANY IDEA WHERE HE
MIGHT BE STAYING?

06:31.425 --> 06:33.892
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.795
WELL, YOU SHOULD CHECK
YOUR BASEMENT.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.236
Aria: ( sighs ) CAN'T
BELIEVE IT WAS TRASHED...

06:44.238 --> 06:46.838
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT
THAT "A" WOULD GIVE IT A REST.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.741
IT'S LIKE TOBY HAD TO KILL
ALISON ALL OVER AGAIN.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.676
TOBY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TOBY?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.946
HIS MOTORCYCLE WAS TOTALED.
ISN'T HE DEAD?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.949
I HEAR MORE FROM ALISON NOW
THEN WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.118
YOU GUYS, I THOUGHT WE DECIDED
"A" WASN'T TOBY.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.587
"A" WAS HAPPY TO HAVE TOBY
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.990
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT TOBY
DIDN'T JUST SEND THAT TEXT?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.426
AND WHY ARE WE SUDDENLY
TRUSTING "A"?

07:07.428 --> 07:08.994
"A" MADE A FAKE BRACELET
TO MESS WITH US.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.597
EMILY, HEY,
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

07:12.599 --> 07:15.200
YEAH, WHY WEREN'T YOU
AT SPENCER'S LAST NIGHT?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.968
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.271
I DIDN'T GET OUT OF PRACTICE
TILL REALLY LATE, SO...

07:19.273 --> 07:21.773
JUST WENT STRAIGHT HOME
AND CRASHED.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.442
SO, WHAT HAVE I MISSED?

07:23.444 --> 07:25.444
WELL, WE STUDIED.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.746
<i> THEY</i> STUDIED
AND I ANNOYED THEM.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.515
AND ALISON'S MEMORIAL
GOT TRASHED.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.150
YEAH. I HEARD.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.954
WHAT IS MY MOM DOING HERE?

07:41.161 --> 07:44.362
MOM, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

07:44.364 --> 07:45.997
OH, I TRIED CALLING YOU,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.500
BUT YOUR PHONE MUST BE
TURNED OFF FOR THE TEST.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.168
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
THEY CALLED

07:50.170 --> 07:52.671
AND SAID THEY NEEDED PROCTORS.
I'M ON THE SUB LIST.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.507
YOU ARE? SINCE WHEN?

07:55.509 --> 07:58.243
WELL, SINCE THEY CUT
MY HOURS AT THE GALLERY

07:58.245 --> 08:00.445
AND I'M PAYING RENT
TO LIVE ABOVE IT.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.414
I FILLED OUT AN APPLICATION
LAST MONDAY.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.315
WHAT, TO TEACH?

08:04.751 --> 08:07.385
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

08:07.387 --> 08:10.689
WELL, SWEETIE, I WAS GOING TO
WHEN YOU CAME OVER FOR DINNER,

08:10.691 --> 08:13.725
BUT THEN YOU CANCELED
ON MONDAY... AND TUESDAY,

08:13.727 --> 08:14.926
AND THEN ON WEDNESDAY.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.229
YEAH, THIS WEEK'S
BEEN INTENSE.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.830
I UNDERSTAND.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.100
I JUST, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU IN THE FLESH.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.740
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY PLAN ON
EVER COMING OVER, DO YOU?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.709
I CAN'T.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.911
LOOK, IF I DID,
IT'D BE LIKE SAYING

08:32.913 --> 08:35.180
I'M OKAY WITH YOU
AND DAD LIVING APART.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.616
BUT WE ARE.
I KNOW!

08:37.618 --> 08:40.085
JUST 'CAUSE YOU WERE READY
FOR THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AM.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.924
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE LIBRARY.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.642
HELLO?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.610
<i> ASHLEY, IT'S</i>
<i> BYRON MONTGOMERY.</i>

09:05.612 --> 09:08.380
OH. HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

09:08.382 --> 09:10.081
<i> I'M KINDA SCREWED.</i>

09:10.083 --> 09:12.484
I'VE GOT THIS FAX TO SEND,
AND WE'VE JUST LOST POWER.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.519
IS IT OUT ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE STREET, TOO?

09:14.521 --> 09:16.721
NO. IT'S FINE.

09:16.723 --> 09:20.458
YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME OVER HERE
IF YOU NEED TO USE THE FAX.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.228
REALLY? WELL, LISTEN,
I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.698
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WAS JUST, UM...

09:26.700 --> 09:28.967
ORDERING SOMETHING
FROM A CATALOGUE,

09:28.969 --> 09:31.369
BUT YOU CAN COME OVER.
<i> GREAT. LISTEN, UM...</i>

09:31.371 --> 09:33.972
DO YOU MIND IF I USE
YOUR TOASTER, TOO?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.540
I'LL BRING
MY OWN BREAD.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.343
UH, YOU MAY ALSO WANT
TO BRING YOUR OWN JELLY.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.578
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.483
THE TEST WILL NOW BEGIN
AT 10:00.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.252
IF THIS INTERFERES
WITH ANY PLANS

09:47.254 --> 09:50.689
YOU'VE MADE FOR THE AFTERNOON,
I SUGGEST YOU MAKE SOME CALLS.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.390
IF YOU DIDN'T BRING A PHONE,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.593
I AM SURE THIS
TAP-HAPPY GENTLEMAN OVER HERE

09:54.595 --> 09:56.661
WOULD BE GLAD
TO LEND YOU HIS.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.331
WHAT? WAS SHE
TALKING TO ME?

09:59.333 --> 10:01.733
YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.101
DO YOU WANT
TO BORROW MY PHONE?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.770
YOUR BRAIN. CAN YOU DO
THE MATH SECTION FOR ME?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.406
HEY, I'M ALREADY
YOUR MARKETING MANAGER.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.176
YOU JUST GOT THREE HITS
ON YOUR LEATHER JACKET.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.845
HEY, THERE, LADY "H."

10:13.847 --> 10:16.481
I KNOW YOU ALSO ANSWER
TO THAT, HERMIE,

10:16.483 --> 10:19.150
BUT I WAS TALKING TO HER.
NICE BAG.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.686
LISTEN TO YOU, IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR FEMININE SIDE!

10:21.688 --> 10:23.888
SO, WOULD THAT BE
YOUR RIGHT OR YOUR LEFT?

10:27.227 --> 10:29.094
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

10:29.096 --> 10:31.296
NOTHING. YOU NEED
TO SIGN IN.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.232
THEY KNOW I'M HERE.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.767
THIS BEAUTY DOESN'T
NEED A BEAST.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.854
WHO WOULD I SPEAK TO
ABOUT GETTING INTO
THE BOYS' LOCKER ROOM?

10:55.856 --> 10:58.690
I'D HAVE TO FIND A CUSTODIAN.
DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.126
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA WAIT HERE.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.894
HE'S FREAKING
ME OUT!

11:02.896 --> 11:05.130
WHOSE LOCKER IS HE
POKING INTO NOW?

11:05.132 --> 11:07.632
HE'S DESPERATE.
ALI'S BROTHER'S
BREATHING DOWN HIS NECK.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.135
OURS TOO. WHAT IF JASON
TOLD THE POLICE

11:10.137 --> 11:12.370
ALISON'S VERSION OF WHAT
HAPPENED AFTER THE FIRE?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.973
IF JASON WAS GONNA
TELL THEM, HE WOULD'VE
TOLD THEM A YEAR AGO.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.341
HE KNOWS THAT STORY'S BOGUS.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.976
WELL, THEN, WHY DO THEY
BRING IT UP?

11:17.978 --> 11:20.745
TO TRY TO DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN US.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.280
WELL, HE'S NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.215
Wilden: SORRY ABOUT
THE MEMORIAL.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.151
I KNOW HOW HARD
YOU GIRLS WORKED ON IT.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.720
SHOCKING THOUGH, RIGHT,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

11:28.722 --> 11:30.922
COULD HAPPEN OUT IN THE OPEN
AND NOBODY SAW ANYTHING?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.390
WELL, EVERYBODY HERE
WAS PROBABLY STUDYING

11:32.392 --> 11:34.292
FOR THE EXAM THAT
WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE,

11:34.294 --> 11:37.328
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK
FOR EYEWITNESSES
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.331
SO YOU WERE ALL STUDYING
TOGETHER LAST NIGHT, THEN?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.901
YES, WE WERE
ALL AT SPENCER'S.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.936
ALL OF YOU?

11:44.938 --> 11:47.005
YES. ALL OF US.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.709
OKAY.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.981
Spencer: EMILY,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

11:56.983 --> 11:58.450
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

11:58.452 --> 12:01.286
I TOLD YOU.
I WENT HOME.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.787
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL HIM THAT?

12:02.789 --> 12:04.589
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US
STICKING TOGETHER?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.128
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.330
TO THE RESTROOM,
BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME

12:12.332 --> 12:14.299
WE CAN ALL TRY AND SQUEEZE
INTO ONE STALL.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.471
SHOULD ONE OF US
GO TALK TO HER?

12:19.473 --> 12:21.873
NO. SHE'LL TALK
WHEN SHE'S READY.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.013
( rings )

13:36.683 --> 13:37.916
ALEX, HEY.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.419
OH, HEY.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.788
HEY. ARE YOU TAKING
THE TEST IN HERE, TOO?

13:43.790 --> 13:46.491
IF WE EVER TAKE IT.
ONLY EIGHT KIDS SHOWED UP
FROM MY SCHOOL.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.927
UM... LISTEN.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.261
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

13:50.263 --> 13:52.063
BETWEEN YOU
AND MY MOM AT THE CLUB.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.165
I KNOW SHE CAN BE
KIND OF A HANDFUL.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.501
I'VE SEEN HER SEND BACK
A NAPKIN BECAUSE IT HAD,

13:56.503 --> 13:57.769
LIKE, A LOOSE THREAD.

13:57.771 --> 14:01.472
I THINK I SHOULD LOOK
AT MY MATH STUFF.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.274
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.809
OKAY.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.422
OKAY, WHAT GIVES?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.791
WHY IS HE/SHE INTO ME?

14:19.793 --> 14:21.693
HE'S NOT INTO YOU.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.562
HE HELPED ME SELL
THAT BAG.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.965
YOU BOUGHT IT
ONLINE, RIGHT?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.466
WELL, IT'S MINE.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.602
EXCUSE ME?

14:30.604 --> 14:32.704
THAT'S NOT
THE ORIGINAL HANDLE.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.206
I BROKE IT
ON A ROLLER COASTER
AT JOLLY ROGER'S.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.475
YOU BOUGHT MY BAG.

14:37.477 --> 14:41.579
YEAH, I KNEW THAT!
I BOUGHT IT AS A GOOF.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.448
REALLY?
YES.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.384
BUT FORGET ABOUT ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.586
YOU'VE BEFRIENDED SOMEBODY
FROM A DIFFERENT SPECIES,

14:48.588 --> 14:50.889
AND YOU'VE TURNED YOUR CLOSET
INTO A SWAP MEET.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.891
WHAT ARE YOU, POOR NOW?

14:52.893 --> 14:56.794
NO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT
THAT BAG ANYMORE.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.296
I'LL GIVE YOU BACK
YOUR MONEY.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.498
DON'T BOTHER.
TAKE MY ANDREW JACKSONS

15:00.500 --> 15:02.600
AND INTRODUCE THEM
TO YOUR BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.202
PUT IT TOWARDS
MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.203
I REGISTERED AT SAKS.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.922
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.523
UH, NO.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.025
IF THIS TEST ISN'T HAPPENING,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.960
ARE WE ALLOWED
TO LEAVE THE ROOM?

15:28.962 --> 15:31.729
THEY JUST POSTED
A TORNADO WATCH
IN DELAWARE COUNTY.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.165
NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE.
HAVE A SEAT.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.371
TELL ME YOU'RE
A BASKETBALL FAN.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.240
WHY?

15:42.242 --> 15:44.375
GOT FLOOR SEATS
TO THE SIXERS GAME
FRIDAY NIGHT.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.710
THEY'RE PLAYING
THE CELTICS.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.380
NO. THAT'S REALLY SWEET--

15:49.382 --> 15:51.049
IT'S NOT A DATE.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.184
I MEAN, IT'S A DATE,
BUT IT'S NOT A DATE-DATE.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.354
I THINK I ALREADY
HAVE PLANS.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.189
OKAY.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.657
ANOTHER TIME,
ANOTHER SEASON.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.692
DO YOU LIKE HOCKEY?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.895
NEVER MIND, NO GIRL
LIKES HOCKEY.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.699
I'LL WORK ON THIS.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.701
WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:09.703 --> 16:11.502
THEY SAID WE COULDN'T
LEAVE THE BUILDING.

16:11.504 --> 16:16.007
THERE ARE OTHER ROOMS
AROUND HERE THAT ARE
MORE FUN THAN THIS.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.508
WANNA COME?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.915
SO, HOW DO YOU
LIKE YOUR TOAST--

16:23.917 --> 16:25.783
BARELY WARM,
OR BURNT TO A CRISP?

16:25.785 --> 16:27.485
UH, WHATEVER'S EASIER.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.021
( fritzes )

16:30.023 --> 16:32.123
BARELY WARM IT IS!

16:32.125 --> 16:34.292
UH, WAIT, NO. LISTEN,
LET'S JUST WAIT A SECOND.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.827
THE LIGHTS WILL
COME BACK ON.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.697
( thunder rumbles )

16:39.699 --> 16:41.532
I BETTER LOOK
FOR SOME CANDLES.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.668
NO, NO.
NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.336
THE POWER IS GONNA
COME BACK ON.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.938
IT HAS TO. THIS WAS
DUE YESTERDAY.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.406
WHAT IS IT?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.608
UH, JEEZ. IT'S A...

16:52.145 --> 16:54.012
IT'S A PERMISSION SLIP.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.214
MY SON IS ON
A LACROSSE TRIP,

16:56.216 --> 16:58.883
AND I FORGOT TO SEND
IN HIS PERMISSION SLIP.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.352
ELLA ALWAYS HANDLED
THIS STUFF, AND I...

17:01.354 --> 17:02.854
I JUST FORGOT.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.956
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.791
CAN YOU CALL THE COACH?

17:06.793 --> 17:08.259
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.429
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT DOING
VERY WELL AT THIS...

17:11.431 --> 17:15.967
THIS WHOLE, UH,
SINGLE-PARENT THING.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.469
EVERYTHING IS JUST FALLING
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.272
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ON YOUR OWN
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, BYRON.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.907
YOU SHOULD CUT
YOURSELF SOME SLACK.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.211
( strums )

17:27.213 --> 17:29.147
DO YOU PLAY?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.082
SHH, IT'S A SECRET.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.583
WHY?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.485
MY PARENTS HAVE
THIS RECURRING NIGHTMARE

17:34.487 --> 17:35.720
I'LL BAIL ON COLLEGE

17:35.722 --> 17:37.021
AND BEG FOR QUARTERS
IN THE SUBWAY.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.962
I KNOW THAT.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.398
MY PARENTS
LISTENED TO IT.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
THEY--THEY USED TO.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.702
( thunder crashes )

17:51.704 --> 17:54.939
WHOA. SO INTENSE.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.474
I COULD PLAY LOUDER.

18:09.389 --> 18:13.958
¶ ACROSS THE EVENING SKY ¶

18:13.960 --> 18:23.000
¶ ALL THE BIRDS
ARE LEAVING ¶

18:23.002 --> 18:24.702
( girl giggling )

18:38.852 --> 18:40.818
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.653
THEIR NAMES.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.690
PIP. MR. WOPSLE.
UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.126
THEY ALL SOUND
LIKE STUFFED ANIMALS.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.429
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ALREADY FINISHED IT.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.331
WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENS?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.699
I CAN MAKE YOU
A CHEAT SHEET.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.570
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
REALLY LET ME BRAID
YOUR HAIR SOMETIME.

18:59.572 --> 19:03.474
I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT
ABOUT JENNA.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.709
EMILY, DON'T.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.977
OKAY, STOP THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.478
THERE'S ALL SORTS
OF OPERATIONS

19:07.480 --> 19:08.946
AND STUFF THEY CAN DO.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.349
I DREAMT THAT SHE CAME BACK
AND SHE WAS FINE.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.185
SHE COULD SEE PERFECTLY,
AND SHE FORGAVE US.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.254
THAT'S WHY
I LOVE YOU.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.623
YOU'RE BIG
ON HAPPY ENDINGS.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.361
SO IS DICKENS,
BY THE WAY.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.863
PIP GETS ESTELLA
IN THE END.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.532
CAN I READ YOU
SOMETHING?

19:30.904 --> 19:32.670
"I LOVED HER
AGAINST REASON,

19:32.672 --> 19:36.174
"AGAINST PROMISE,
AGAINST PEACE,

19:36.176 --> 19:38.643
"AGAINST HOPE,
AGAINST HAPPINESS,

19:38.645 --> 19:41.579
AGAINST ALL DISCOURAGEMENT
THAT COULD BE."

19:41.581 --> 19:43.681
DID YOU GET
TO THAT PART YET?

19:52.692 --> 19:56.961
<i> ¶ I KNOW THAT IT'S SO ¶</i>

19:56.963 --> 20:06.504
<i> ¶ UNTIL IT'S TIME</i>
<i> TO GO ¶</i>

20:06.506 --> 20:13.511
<i> ¶ ALL THE STORMS</i>
<i> IN WINTER ¶</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:18.649
<i> ¶ AND THE BIRDS</i>
<i> IN SPRING AGAIN ¶</i>

20:23.223 --> 20:30.661
¶ I DO NOT COUNT THE TIME ¶

20:30.663 --> 20:35.766
¶ FOR WHO KNOWS ¶

20:35.768 --> 20:42.073
¶ WHERE THE TIME GOES ¶

20:42.075 --> 20:46.611
¶ WHO KNOWS ¶

20:46.613 --> 20:52.450
¶ WHERE THE TIME GOES ¶

21:12.905 --> 21:15.039
THEY WANT EVERYBODY
IN THE LIBRARY.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.974
SAFETY REASONS.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.613
ARIA, ARE
YOU COMING?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.149
UM, YEAH, YEAH.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

21:25.151 --> 21:28.185
I JUST-- HAVE TO ASK MR. FITZ
A FEW HOMEWORK QUESTIONS.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.831
SO, YOU'RE BACK.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.768
I NEVER LEFT.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.269
YOU WERE OUT.

21:45.271 --> 21:46.937
WERE YOU SICK?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.175
I ONLY ASK BECAUSE
YOU NEVER ANSWERED

21:51.177 --> 21:54.178
MY CALLS...
OR MY E-MAILS.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.280
I WENT TO NEW YORK.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.515
WHY?

21:57.517 --> 22:01.319
TO... DEAL
WITH FAMILY ISSUES.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.853
FAMILY ISSUES!

22:04.757 --> 22:05.923
MY ISSUES.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.127
I NEEDED TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.730
OKAY, ARE YOU CLEAR?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.432
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT?

22:14.434 --> 22:17.134
I INTERVIEWED
AT ANOTHER SCHOOL, AND...

22:17.136 --> 22:18.836
SO WHAT YOU WANT IS
TO NOT BE HERE AT ALL.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.805
WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME FINISH?

22:20.807 --> 22:22.273
I'M SORRY, I'VE
JUST GOTTEN USED

22:22.275 --> 22:23.974
TO FILLING
IN THE BLANKS MYSELF.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.943
YOU TELL ME
AT HOMECOMING

22:25.945 --> 22:27.478
THAT YOU GOT
A HAIRCUT FOR ME,

22:27.480 --> 22:29.947
AND THEN YOU JUST
FALL OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH?

22:29.949 --> 22:33.317
I SPENT<i> DAYS</i> THINKING
ABOUT YOU!

22:33.319 --> 22:36.120
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
EVERY SECOND I WAS GONE.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.492
BUT I ALSO THOUGHT
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES,

22:41.494 --> 22:44.328
THE QUESTIONS
FROM THE PRINCIPAL,

22:44.330 --> 22:46.731
THE SCHOOL BOARD,
YOUR PARENTS.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.566
MY PARENTS?

22:48.568 --> 22:52.036
WE JUST CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.205
THINGS NEED TO CHANGE.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.207
NO, THEY ALREADY HAVE.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.413
( sniffles )

23:05.051 --> 23:07.218
MM. I THINK
I JUST LOST SERVICE.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.553
HANNA JUST SENT ME A TEXT.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.389
GIRLS ARE FINE.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.224
OH, GOOD.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.059
DO YOU WANT
AN ICE CUBE FOR THAT?

23:15.061 --> 23:16.694
WE SHOULD USE 'EM
BEFORE THEY MELT.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.562
DO YOU KNOW...

23:20.066 --> 23:21.332
WHY ELLA LEFT?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.204
DOES EVERYONE
ON THE STREET KNOW?

23:31.144 --> 23:33.210
WELL, AT LEAST
ONE PERSON'S

23:33.212 --> 23:35.179
STILL WILLING TO
LET ME USE HER FAX.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.818
I DON'T TAKE SIDES.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.554
I KNOW THAT THINGS
ARE NEVER BLACK AND WHITE.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.592
IT'S SO BIZARRE,
ISN'T IT?

23:48.594 --> 23:50.594
I MEAN, YOU SPEND
THIS HUGE CHUNK

23:50.596 --> 23:52.496
OF YOUR LIFE
AS A COUPLE,

23:52.498 --> 23:55.099
AND THEN SUDDENLY
YOU'RE NOT...

23:55.101 --> 23:57.301
A COUPLE.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.770
YOU MAY AS WELL
JUST DISAPPEAR.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.705
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
YOU DON'T EXIST.

24:05.344 --> 24:09.146
I HAD THE SAME CONVERSATION
A WHILE BACK...

24:09.148 --> 24:11.382
TO MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.887
TOOK ME MONTHS BEFORE I WENT
TO SEE A MOVIE ALONE.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.656
WHAT'D YOU SEE?

24:18.658 --> 24:19.990
<i> TRANSFORMERS 2.</i>

24:21.527 --> 24:25.563
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T RUN
INTO ANYONE OVER 12...

24:25.565 --> 24:27.731
BUT I FORGOT

24:27.733 --> 24:29.667
THEY HAVE PARENTS,
AND...

24:29.669 --> 24:31.535
I SPENT THE FIRST HALF
OF THE MOVIE

24:31.537 --> 24:33.637
DODGING A COWORKER
AND HIS WIFE,

24:33.639 --> 24:38.709
AND THE SECOND HALF CRYING
INTO MY POPCORN.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.977
WHY?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.482
'CAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE

24:44.484 --> 24:46.650
WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE
TO SHARE POPCORN WITH.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.822
YEAH. YEAH, I HEAR YA.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.291
SEE, I'VE GOT
THIS FACULTY DINNER

24:54.293 --> 24:55.793
TO GO TO NEXT
SATURDAY NIGHT,

24:55.795 --> 24:58.095
AND HONESTLY, I DON'T
THINK I CAN DO IT.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.865
IT'S AT THIS MOROCCAN
RESTAURANT OUT BY CAMPUS.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.099
I'M NOT VERY ADVENTUROUS

25:02.101 --> 25:03.601
WITH FOODS
I CAN'T PRONOUNCE.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.536
ELLA WAS MY TASTE-TESTER.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.071
YOU SHOULD CALL ME.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.173
I'LL WALK YOU
THROUGH THE MENU.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.442
WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH ME AND MAKE SURE
I DON'T EAT GOAT?

25:11.444 --> 25:13.978
I'VE BEEN THERE.
THEY DO A VERY NICE GOAT.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.549
<i> MOVE! ALL THE WAY IN,</i>
<i> PEOPLE!</i>

25:18.551 --> 25:20.551
YOU DON'T NEED
TO TOUCH EVERY LOCKER.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.719
COME ON!

25:21.721 --> 25:23.187
THIS SUCKS.
FIRST TIME I GET

25:23.189 --> 25:24.588
TO PHOTOGRAPH
A REAL TORNADO,

25:24.590 --> 25:26.490
AND THEY SHOVE
US IN A ROOM
WITHOUT WINDOWS.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.158
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
A REAL TORNADO.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.327
OF COURSE HE DOES.
HE WANTS TO GET TO OZ

25:30.329 --> 25:32.129
SO HE CAN ASK THE WIZARD
FOR A PENIS.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.398
MONA, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.966
WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE
HIM ALONE?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.635
WHAT HAS HE EVER
DONE TO YOU

25:37.637 --> 25:40.170
BESIDES REMIND YOU
THAT TWO SHORT YEARS
AGO, WE WERE HIM.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.605
HE BUGS ME.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.274
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE THE ONE

25:43.276 --> 25:44.775
WHO NEEDS A TRIP TO OZ.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.544
SEE IF THE WIZARD
CAN FIND YOU A HEART.

25:55.688 --> 25:59.056
HEY, I DON'T THINK THIS TEST
IS GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.257
YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.926
NOT ALL OF US
SAILED THROUGH TRIG.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.196
ALEX, ARE WE EVER
GONNA GET PAST THIS?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.498
PAST WHAT?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.133
WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MY MOM.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.734
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT--

26:10.736 --> 26:14.338
IT'S NOT UP TO ME TO TELL YOU.
IT'S UP TO YOUR MOTHER.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.206
( thunder rumbles )

26:25.351 --> 26:27.051
I NEED TO FIND
A FRENCH FAMILY

26:27.053 --> 26:29.253
THAT'S DYING
TO HOST A NICE GIRL
FROM PENNSYLVANIA.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.222
PARIS WOULD BE
SO AWESOME.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.291
ROLL OUT OF BED,

26:34.293 --> 26:36.460
EAT A CROISSANT,
SHOP FOR TWO HOURS,

26:36.462 --> 26:38.095
TAKE A NAP
IN THE LOUVRE,

26:38.097 --> 26:40.364
EAT ANOTHER CROISSANT,
SHOP FOR TWO HOURS.

26:42.602 --> 26:43.867
OH, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

26:43.869 --> 26:45.936
I GOT IT IN
THE FRENCH CATALOGUE.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.105
THEY HAVE THEM IN,
LIKE, EVERY COLOR.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.007
DO ME A FAVOR? HOOK IT
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.491
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:07.493 --> 27:09.827
NOTHING. I JUST...

27:09.829 --> 27:11.161
YOU JUST WHAT?

27:11.163 --> 27:14.164
JUST BECAUSE WE KISSED
IN THE LIBRARY, EMILY,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.066
DOESN'T MEAN I'M
INTO YOU LIKE THAT.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.235
A KISS IS A KISS.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.104
I LIKE BOYS...

27:20.106 --> 27:21.772
AND TRUST ME,
IF I'M KISSING YOU,

27:21.774 --> 27:23.674
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S PRACTICE
FOR THE REAL THING.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.850
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:32.852 --> 27:33.784
YOU'RE MY RIDE,
REMEMBER?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.257
( metal clicks,
electricity fritzes )

27:45.498 --> 27:47.631
HELLO? SOMEONE HERE?

28:04.850 --> 28:05.983
HELLO?

28:09.855 --> 28:14.024
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WHERE'S MY BAG? HELLO?

28:35.414 --> 28:37.448
Ella: MR. FITZ? HI.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.883
UH, THEY NEED
FIRST AID SUPPLIES, TOO.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.351
IS SOMEBODY HURT?

28:41.353 --> 28:43.554
NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S JUST
A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.290
I'M ELLA MONTGOMERY,
ARIA'S MOM?

28:46.292 --> 28:47.291
WE MET--
AT THE THEATER.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.625
I-I REMEMBER.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.494
WELL, OF COURSE YOU WOULD.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU?

28:50.496 --> 28:51.695
WE PRACTICALLY MET
IN THE DARK.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.432
WHY ARE
THESE LIGHTS WORKING?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.735
UH, EMERGENCY FIXTURES?

28:57.737 --> 28:59.970
I GUESS THE GENERATOR
JUST KICKED IN.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.639
DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ANYTHING TO EAT IN HERE?

29:02.641 --> 29:04.575
WE'VE GOT SOME
JANGLED NERVES OUT THERE,

29:04.577 --> 29:06.744
AND I THINK FOOD
WOULD REALLY HELP.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.013
WELL, WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A LOOK UNDER HERE?

29:10.015 --> 29:14.084
( clears throat )
UH, HOW ARE YOU DOING...
WITH THE STORM?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.153
OH, ME? I LOVE
THIS WEATHER,

29:16.155 --> 29:18.422
AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
TO FLY THROUGH IT.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.591
WHICH, IF WE WERE
ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW,

29:20.593 --> 29:22.359
I'D PROBABLY BE
IN YOUR LAP.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.894
UH, HOW MANY WATERS
DO WE NEED?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.395
UH, I WOULD BRING
THEM ALL.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.663
CAN YOU SHINE THAT
OVER HERE?

29:29.135 --> 29:31.635
YOU WOULD THINK THEY'D HAVE
PROTEIN BARS OR SOMETHING.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.171
DID THEY AT LEAST OPEN
THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA
THIS MORNING?

29:34.173 --> 29:36.607
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT HERE LATE.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.509
DROVE BACK FROM NEW YORK.

29:38.511 --> 29:40.444
YOU DID? WOW.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.646
IN THIS WEATHER,
THAT'S DEDICATION.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.482
NO WONDER ARIA TALKS
SO HIGHLY ABOUT YOU.

29:45.484 --> 29:49.586
WELL, I AM GRATEFUL
TO HAVE HER IN MY CLASS.

29:49.588 --> 29:53.791
SHE'S, UH, SHE'S
VERY ENGAGED.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.592
GOOD.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.295
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

30:00.166 --> 30:02.299
S-S-SURE.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.935
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANY CHANGES IN ARIA
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.672
UM...

30:08.674 --> 30:12.075
I ONLY ASK BECAUSE,
UM, MY HUSBAND AND I,

30:12.077 --> 30:16.513
WE SEPARATED, AND I WAS
WONDERING IF AND HOW

30:16.515 --> 30:18.816
THAT'S AFFECTING ARIA
AT SCHOOL.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.552
IT'S NOT REALLY
A QUESTION YOU CAN
DIRECTLY ASK YOUR KID.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.988
OF COURSE NOT.
I'M SORRY...

30:24.990 --> 30:27.024
ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.162
AS FAR AS ARIA GOES,
I HAVEN'T NOTICED ANYTHING,

30:32.164 --> 30:35.299
UM... ALARMING.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.267
GOOD.
SHE'S VERY STRONG.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.502
YEAH.
YEAH.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.073
BUT SHE PUTS UP
A GOOD FRONT,

30:43.075 --> 30:45.709
AND, UM,
WHEN SHE'S HURT

30:45.711 --> 30:47.678
AND SHE WANTS
TO SHUT YOU OUT,

30:47.680 --> 30:49.179
YOU COULD DIE
OF FROSTBITE.

30:53.686 --> 30:54.885
OH, PROTEIN BARS.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.255
EXCUSE ME.
SURE.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.561
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD

31:04.563 --> 31:07.531
THAT SHE HAS YOU
IN HER LIFE RIGHT NOW,

31:07.533 --> 31:10.033
AN ADULT THAT
SHE ADMIRES.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.869
MM.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.303
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE...

31:15.774 --> 31:17.708
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
A COUPLE OF TRIPS.

31:20.112 --> 31:23.313
HEY, EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH MR. FITZ?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.216
YEAH, UH, JUST HAD
A FEW QUESTIONS.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.218
HE WAS OUT LAST WEEK.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.288
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE VOICE.
WE SHOULD DO THAT AGAIN.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.031
EMILY, YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.232
I DIDN'T HEAR
THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.700
I WAS LOOKING
FOR MY PURSE.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.503
IT'S PROBABLY
STILL IN THE LIBRARY.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.606
LOOK, EM, IF YOU
WERE HOOKING UP
WITH MAYA LAST NIGHT,

31:49.608 --> 31:51.208
YOU CAN TELL ARIA
AND SPENCER.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.709
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:52.711 --> 31:55.312
I'M JUST SAYING IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THIS HUGE SECRET.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.947
IT'S NOT LIKE I FELL APART.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.449
OKAY, CAN WE NOT TALK
ABOUT THIS IN HERE?

31:59.451 --> 32:02.386
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU CAN TRUST THEM.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.188
EMILY, I THINK WE FOUND
SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO YOU.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.191
COULD YOU COME
WITH ME, PLEASE?

32:08.193 --> 32:09.826
EMILY! LET'S GO.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.902
IS THAT YOUR BAG
ON THE TABLE?

32:18.904 --> 32:20.437
WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.905
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU

32:21.907 --> 32:23.140
THAT LEAVING
A BAG UNATTENDED

32:23.142 --> 32:25.442
IN A PUBLIC PLACE,
NOT A VERY SMART MOVE.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.910
WHAT IS GOING ON?

32:26.912 --> 32:30.247
OH, PERFECT! WE CAN ALL
BE TOGETHER FOR AN UPDATE.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.249
NO, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.917
WELL, I'M GUESSING
YOU GIRLS ARE USED

32:33.919 --> 32:36.386
TO BEING IN PLACES
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.755
DID YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT,

32:38.757 --> 32:40.590
WHEN YOU WEREN'T STUDYING
FOR THE TEST?

32:40.592 --> 32:43.293
SEE, 'CAUSE I GOT THESE
REALLY INTERESTING PHOTOS.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.800
GO AHEAD
AND PASS IT AROUND.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.135
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM
AT THE PRECINCT.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.375
AND I SEE YOU DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE TO CLEAN
YOUR SHOES EITHER, HUH?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.778
THAT'S NOT WHY
I WENT THERE.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.914
REALLY? SO YOU DIDN'T
GO BACK TO THE MEMORIAL

33:03.916 --> 33:05.449
TO FINISH UP
TOBY'S HANDIWORK?

33:05.451 --> 33:07.651
OR WERE YOU JUST THERE
COVERING UP HIS TRACKS?

33:07.653 --> 33:10.754
I FOUND IT LIKE THAT.
IT WAS ALREADY DESTROYED.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.222
REALLY?

33:13.525 --> 33:16.259
THEN LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.962
WHAT WERE THESE
DOING IN YOUR BAG?

33:18.964 --> 33:22.532
SOUVENIRS? SOMETHING TOBY
ASKED YOU TO SAVE

33:22.534 --> 33:24.301
SO HE CAN KEEP IT
FOR HIS TROPHY COLLECTION?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.536
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH TOBY!

33:26.538 --> 33:28.672
EM, WHY DO YOU HAVE THOSE?

33:30.809 --> 33:33.310
YOU PUT THOSE IN THERE,
YOU CREEP.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.912
EMILY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
THE MEMORIAL WAS HER IDEA.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.614
YEAH, SO I HEARD.
NICE COVER, HUH?

33:39.852 --> 33:41.718
YOU WANT ME TO SHARE
THIS WITH THEM,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.286
OR WOULD YOU
LIKE TO?

33:43.288 --> 33:45.188
GO AHEAD AND TELL THEM
ABOUT THE ANGRY LETTER

33:45.190 --> 33:46.723
THAT YOU WROTE
TO ALISON...

33:46.725 --> 33:48.325
WHICH IS DATED,
BY THE WAY,

33:48.327 --> 33:50.460
THREE DAYS BEFORE
SHE DISAPPEARED.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.596
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO READ THAT.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.965
EMILY, WHAT
IS IN THAT LETTER?

33:54.967 --> 33:57.134
TELL HER. TELL HER
HOW YOU WANTED

33:57.136 --> 33:59.503
TO PUNISH ALISON
FOR REJECTING YOU.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.005
TELL HER HOW YOU FELT
RELIEVED AT THE FUNERAL.

34:02.007 --> 34:06.343
YEAH, SHE WASN'T GONNA
BE AROUND TO HUMILIATE
YOU ANYMORE, WAS SHE?

34:06.345 --> 34:09.079
I WENT BACK TO THAT MEMORIAL
TO SAY I WAS SORRY.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.182
THERE WERE HORRIBLE THINGS
IN THAT LETTER,

34:12.184 --> 34:14.184
AND I DIDN'T MEAN THEM.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.086
SUDDENLY SHE WAS GONE,
AND...

34:20.059 --> 34:22.726
I LOVED HER
AS MORE THAN A FRIEND.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.798
I JUST NEVER HAD THE CHANCE
TO TELL HER IN THE RIGHT WAY.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.871
GIVE HER THE LETTER BACK.
GIVE IT BACK TO HER NOW,

34:34.873 --> 34:37.541
OR I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!

34:37.543 --> 34:39.109
SORRY, I CAN'T.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.610
AND WE'RE NOT
LEAVING THIS ROOM

34:40.612 --> 34:42.479
UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

34:42.481 --> 34:44.448
CARTING AROUND PIECES
OF ALISON'S MEMORIAL.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.384
I TOOK THEM BECAUSE THEY
WERE THE ONLY THINGS
THAT WEREN'T BROKEN.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.286
( door squeaks )

34:49.288 --> 34:50.687
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

34:52.357 --> 34:54.424
WHY AREN'T THEY
IN THE LOCKER ROOM
WITH THE OTHER KIDS?

34:54.426 --> 34:55.826
WHO ARE YOU?

34:55.828 --> 34:59.062
HER MOTHER. I MEAN,
IF THIS IS THE SCHOOL'S IDEA

34:59.064 --> 35:01.965
OF KEEPING MY CHILD SAFE,
I'M GLAD I CAME BACK.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.101
HONEY, WHY
IS SHE CRYING?

35:04.103 --> 35:06.570
HE ACCUSED HER
OF KILLING ALISON.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.905
WHAT?
Aria: HE WENT
THROUGH HER PURSE,

35:08.907 --> 35:11.074
AND NOW HE'S ACCUSING--
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

35:11.076 --> 35:14.244
YOU'RE QUESTIONING MINORS
WITHOUT AN ADULT PRESENT?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.880
WHAT POLICE DEPARTMENT
DO YOU WORK FOR?

35:16.882 --> 35:18.782
WHAT CENTURY ARE YOU IN?

35:18.784 --> 35:21.885
MA'AM, I WOULD ADVISE YOU--
OH, NO, I WOULD ADVISE
YOU TO BACK OFF,

35:21.887 --> 35:23.520
BECAUSE ANYTHING
THAT THEY'VE SAID TO YOU

35:23.522 --> 35:25.856
IS INADMISSIBLE
IN A COURTROOM, PERIOD.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.491
LET'S GO. EMILY, HONEY,
GRAB YOUR THINGS.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.598
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.766
I HAVE A HOMICIDE
TO SOLVE, OKAY?

35:36.768 --> 35:38.568
NOT ANYMORE YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE DONE.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.637
YOU'RE DONE
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION,

35:40.639 --> 35:43.173
UNLESS YOU WANT TO FACE ME DOWN
WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.416
SO, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM?
CAN THEY GET HIM OFF THE FORCE?

35:53.418 --> 35:55.552
IF HE'S SMART,
HE'LL LEAVE BEFORE
THAT HAPPENS.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.587
OH, WHERE DID HE GET
THAT PROTEIN BAR?

35:57.589 --> 35:58.722
OH. I'LL
GET YOU ONE.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.130
EM.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.800
I WISH I'D KNOWN.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.870
HEY, ALISON LOVED YOU,

36:13.872 --> 36:16.239
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF IT WAS IN THE WAY

36:16.241 --> 36:19.309
THAT YOU WANTED HER TO,
BUT I KNOW THAT SHE DID.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.112
Principal: CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

36:22.114 --> 36:25.949
THE STORM WARNING
HAS JUST BEEN LIFTED,

36:25.951 --> 36:28.485
BUT THE S.A.T.
WILL HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULED.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.420
( cheering )

36:37.429 --> 36:40.630
YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.365
ALEX, BUT...

36:42.367 --> 36:43.967
HE MIGHT'VE
ALREADY LEFT.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.535
DIDN'T YOU BRING
AN UMBRELLA?

36:45.537 --> 36:47.270
YEAH.

36:51.276 --> 36:54.177
MOM, THANK YOU
FOR STOPPING IN.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.880
IT WAS PRO BONO.
LET'S GO.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.815
WAIT, I--

36:58.817 --> 37:01.151
I REALLY CAN'T SIT IN
THE CAR THE WHOLE RIDE HOME

37:01.153 --> 37:03.653
WITHOUT ASKING WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND ALEX.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.988
WHAT DID HE SAY?

37:04.990 --> 37:06.923
NOTHING. HE WON'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.642
OH, MY GOD. THIS
REQUIRES CLOSING A DOOR.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.477
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST WALK HOME.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.945
REMEMBER THAT WEEKEND
WHEN YOUR FATHER

37:28.947 --> 37:32.515
TOOK YOU AND MELISSA
TO D.C.? I STAYED BEHIND.

37:32.517 --> 37:33.850
YEAH...

37:33.852 --> 37:36.186
I SAID I HAD TO WORK
ALL WEEKEND,

37:36.188 --> 37:37.887
BUT THAT WASN'T
THE TRUTH.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.223
I SPENT MOST
OF FRIDAY DRUNK.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.892
SUNDAY I WAS HUNG OVER.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.028
SATURDAY I DON'T
REMEMBER AT ALL.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.730
OKAY, I THINK I ACTUALLY
CHANGED MY MIND.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.031
I REALLY DON'T
NEED TO KNOW.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.532
I STARTED AT THE CLUB
FRIDAY MORNING.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.868
IT WAS EMPTY.
THERE WASN'T A SOUL TO TALK TO,

37:51.870 --> 37:53.703
SO I ORDERED A SIDECAR,

37:53.705 --> 37:56.640
THEN ANOTHER
AND ANOTHER.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.041
BY THE TIME LUNCH
ROLLED AROUND,

37:58.043 --> 37:59.309
I'D WALKED
THROUGH A TRELLIS

37:59.311 --> 38:00.810
AND COULDN'T FIND
MY SHOES.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.013
IT WAS ALEX'S
FIRST WEEK THERE.

38:03.015 --> 38:05.415
HE KINDLY LISTENED
TO ME SPILL MY GUTS,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.851
AND LATER POURED ME
INTO A CAB.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.053
WITH MY SHOES.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.222
WHY WERE YOU SPILLING
YOUR GUTS TO ALEX?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.027
I HAD A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
BEFORE I WENT THERE.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.399
THEY REMOVED A LUMP
FROM MY BREAST.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.072
I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE OVERWHELMED...

38:30.709 --> 38:32.242
AND POWERLESS.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.381
AFTER THAT, I AVOIDED
THE CLUB FOR MONTHS.

38:38.383 --> 38:41.451
THE NEXT TIME I SAW ALEX,
I MADE HIM PROMISE

38:41.453 --> 38:43.353
THAT HE WOULD NEVER,
EVER BRING IT UP.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.691
MOM, ARE YOU SICK?

38:47.693 --> 38:49.693
NO.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.929
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
AND DAD TELL US?

38:52.931 --> 38:55.131
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOUR DAD KNOWS?

38:55.133 --> 38:57.801
SPENCER... OUR FAMILY

38:57.803 --> 38:59.969
DOESN'T HANDLE
IMPERFECTION VERY WELL.

39:01.740 --> 39:06.142
MOM, BEING SICK
IS NOT AN IMPERFECTION.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.048
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

39:12.050 --> 39:13.950
I GAVE UP SIDECARS
FOR SPRITZERS.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.086
( chuckles )

39:17.656 --> 39:21.024
AND BY THE WAY...
ALEX IS A LOVELY KID.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.095
HE'S A KEEPER.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.805
Byron: I'M IMPRESSED.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.807
YOU COULD DO BRAIN SURGERY
WITH THOSE HANDS.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.710
( laughs ) NO, HONESTLY,
I CAN DO A PEDICURE.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.947
HEY.
WHOA.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.282
OKAY, LET'S-- HEY,
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

39:46.284 --> 39:49.252
OKAY. WAIT.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.888
I THINK IT ALREADY WENT.

39:51.890 --> 39:55.125
"TRANSMISSION RECEIVED."
THERE YOU GO.

39:55.127 --> 39:58.795
FANTASTIC. WELL,
I OWE YOU BIG TIME.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.131
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
FOR CARPOOL THIS WEEK.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.133
I WILL DRIVE HANNA
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY,

40:03.135 --> 40:06.202
AND I'LL SEE YOU FOR DINNER
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.471
RIGHT! SATURDAY.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.412
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING, ACTUALLY.

40:15.414 --> 40:18.081
I CAN'T HAVE DINNER
AT THAT MOROCCAN RESTAURANT
THIS SATURDAY.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.717
MIKE HAS A SCRIMMAGE GAME
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON,

40:20.719 --> 40:23.453
AND I PROMISED I WOULD TAKE
HIS TEAM OUT AFTERWARDS.

40:23.455 --> 40:26.289
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
SATURDAY ISN'T...

40:26.291 --> 40:28.057
GOOD FOR ME, EITHER.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.696
BUT W-WE'LL
FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.

40:33.698 --> 40:35.598
DEFINITELY.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.335
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.403
FOR THIS.
MM-HMM.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.674
BYE.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.589
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE
YOU LATER, MAN.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.361
HEY.

41:05.363 --> 41:08.698
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I THINK WE SHOULD--

41:08.700 --> 41:10.667
HAVE THAT DATE-DATE.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.969
SERIOUSLY? WHEN?

41:15.340 --> 41:18.007
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY?

41:18.009 --> 41:20.844
I THINK I'M HAVING DINNER
AT MY MOM'S ON FRIDAY,

41:20.846 --> 41:23.580
BUT HOW ABOUT SATURDAY?

41:23.582 --> 41:25.248
YEAH, WORKS FOR ME.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.198
HEY.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.535
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

41:45.537 --> 41:47.904
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
IT'S A SECRET.

42:22.908 --> 42:26.876
SO, 96 BUCKS
FOR YOUR LEATHER JACKET.

42:26.878 --> 42:31.347
GOING... GOING...

42:31.349 --> 42:33.917
GONE. COOL!
THAT WAS EASY.

42:33.919 --> 42:37.420
LISTEN, UM... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID TO MONA,

42:37.422 --> 42:39.689
BUT THANK YOU.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.824
SHE ACTUALLY MADE IT
THROUGH TWO HOURS

42:41.826 --> 42:44.060
IN THE LOCKER ROOM
WITHOUT SPITTING ON ME.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.529
YEAH, YOU DON'T
NEED TO THANK ME.

42:46.531 --> 42:49.032
YEAH, I DO.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.801
NO, YOU DON'T.
I'M YOUR FRIEND... GEEK.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.673
HANNA...

43:10.922 --> 43:12.622
I KNOW YOU WANNA KISS ME.
