Homer, how long

Long enough that me and Marge

who just sit and hold hands.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.978

Lenny had a terrible fall.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.771
You know who else fell?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.273
Dr. Hibbert.

Homer, you can't
afford $300 a month?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.514
No.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.600

04:02.158 --> 04:06.246
a delightful Hong Kong horror
remake known as <i>Crawlspace,</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:08.790
based on<i> Paxing Kongjian.</i>

04:08.873 --> 04:10.750
Well, count me out, Jimbo.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.919
I don't need to hear
how every chick in the movie

04:13.002 --> 04:14.921
got what was
coming to them.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.422
Shauna, food for thought:

04:16.506 --> 04:19.384
if we don't watch movies
about torture in crawl spaces,

04:19.467 --> 04:21.219
how will we know what to do

04:21.302 --> 04:23.930
if someone puts us
in a torture crawl space?

04:24.013 --> 04:26.057
Not if, when.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.893
Nah, I'm gonna go see one
of those Jennifer Aniston movies

04:28.977 --> 04:30.895
where she rolls her eyes
on the poster.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.480
Mm.

04:32.563 --> 04:36.192
Babe, you know I don't want you
watching a movie by yourself.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.027
You're a total perv magnet.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.070
Aw!

04:39.153 --> 04:41.030
So, I'll find
someone to take you.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.075
Someone unthreatening.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.412
Hey, you know our deal:

04:47.495 --> 04:49.706
chaperones cannot be humiliating.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.332
She's got you there.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.459
-How 'bout this one?
-Simpson?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.711
Let's see.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.212
No starter stache,

04:56.296 --> 04:57.630

04:57.714 --> 05:02.593

Total pre-puber.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.639
Now, you stay close
to my Shauna.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.642
If someone so much as
peels a ladybug decal

05:09.726 --> 05:13.104
off her fake fingernails,
I'm blaming you!

05:13.187 --> 05:14.814
Come on, come on.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.650

05:52.352 --> 05:54.562

who her boyfriend is?

05:54.645 --> 05:55.938
Jimbo Jones.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.607
I got to go sort tortillas!

05:57.690 --> 06:00.193
Corn, flour, corn, corn,
no gluten, corn.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.486

06:01.569 --> 06:03.696
Oh, now I got to fill out
a form!

06:03.780 --> 06:06.532
Listen, lady, you do not
two-time the man

06:06.616 --> 06:07.700

06:07.784 --> 06:09.827
(scoffs)
Jimbo doesn't care about me.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.038
He didn't even
notice my side braid.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.623
Oh, that is cool.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.958
Looks like two snakes trying
to kill each other on your head.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.585
That's what I was going for.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.546
You know, for a second grader,
you're pretty sharp.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.964
I'm actually in fourth grade,

06:22.048 --> 06:24.967
but I read
at a second-grade level.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.636
They think I might
have a problem.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.887
Wow.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.514
KEARNEY:
Why did I see that movie

06:29.597 --> 06:31.849
the day before I have
to clean the crawl space?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.434
Come on, boy!
We've got to go home!

06:33.518 --> 06:36.854
I saved big bucks
on the delivery charges.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.815

06:38.898 --> 06:40.191

06:40.274 --> 06:42.860
I got to go.
He's my ride.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.529
Not so fast, Simpson.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.032
FYI, you got another date
tomorrow with Shauna.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.283
(chuckles)

06:49.367 --> 06:50.618
Why can't you do it?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.328
We're going to a seminar:

06:52.412 --> 06:55.498
"Extracting Lunch Money
from a Cashless Society."

06:55.581 --> 06:57.834
We're gonna rob the guy
giving the seminar.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.294
Bart and I'll figure out
something.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.254
Yeah.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.589
(humming)

07:03.673 --> 07:04.799
(slurping)

07:04.882 --> 07:05.842
Ah.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.010
Doesn't get
any better than this.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.933
Huh? That's weird,
my armpits are getting wet!

07:14.016 --> 07:16.227
Wow, the TV's hooked
up to the Internet.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.689
You can stream whole
seasons of old TV shows.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.940
Hmm.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.150
Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.776
British version was better.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.944
Totally scripted. Sued it.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.487
<i>Stranded?</i>
What's that?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.448
<i>Stranded</i> was a show
about people marooned

07:28.531 --> 07:30.575
on a mysterious island
that's riddled with

07:30.658 --> 07:32.785
religious and scientific paradoxes.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.995
It was huge.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.080
Well, the first season
and the last season.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.125
Well,
islands are always entertaining,

07:39.208 --> 07:41.752
from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.672
(dramatic music playing)

07:44.755 --> 07:45.798
(screams)

07:45.882 --> 07:47.008
A plane crash!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.470
Wait a minute.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.515
That flashback raised
more questions than it answered.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.434
(grunting)

07:57.185 --> 07:59.020
Oh, my God.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.354
Inside the coconut,

08:00.438 --> 08:03.608
my pet cat

08:03.691 --> 08:05.485

08:05.568 --> 08:07.153
is the number of our flight!

08:07.236 --> 08:08.738
Purr-gatory.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.490
Where are we?!

08:13.159 --> 08:16.078
What a great opening episode!

08:16.162 --> 08:20.082
And I'm sure everything they
said will pay off handsomely!

08:22.126 --> 08:24.670
(dramatic music playing)

08:29.467 --> 08:31.260
Hmm. Ah!

08:33.763 --> 08:34.764
Huh?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.474
Let's go.
And don't look guilty.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.393
(alarm beeping)

08:39.477 --> 08:41.729
Young lady,
I need to check your purse.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.147
I didn't steal nothing.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.483
If anything happens to her,

08:45.566 --> 08:48.819
I'll beat you up
from inside your brain.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.363
(grunts)

08:51.864 --> 08:53.115
I stole this.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.534
You stole perfume?

08:54.617 --> 08:55.952
Uh, yeah, me.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.995
I use it all the time.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.122

09:00.206 --> 09:01.457
<i>♪ You-you-you-you ♪</i>

09:01.541 --> 09:04.252
and I are taking
a trip to mall jail.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.796
Isn't that what used to be
the Beanie Baby store?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.048
Shut up.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.969
(explosion)

09:13.052 --> 09:15.054
This is so cool.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.389
You took a fall for me.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.057
No one's done anything
for me before.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.225
Uh-oh.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.894
Don't worry.
I made sure he can't get too far.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.271
-(tire pops, hisses)
-I'd use my legs

09:23.354 --> 09:24.355
but I've forgotten how!

09:24.438 --> 09:25.815
Come with me.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.611
Hey, the first time we lost Maggie
was in this store!

09:30.695 --> 09:33.197
Bart,
here's my thank-you gift.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.950
What could a girl have
that I...

09:36.033 --> 09:37.743
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

09:37.827 --> 09:39.412
<i>It's just like Dad's!</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:51.048
Bart, you haven't touched
your mashed potatoes.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.634
More breast?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.094
What-- No!

09:55.177 --> 09:57.972
I'm offering you
a chicken breast, you boob!

09:58.055 --> 10:00.766
Doesn't anyone here realize
I'm only ten years old?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.311
Bart,
no dinner means no dessert.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.645
(gasps)

10:04.729 --> 10:06.522
I'm just not ready
for cookies!

10:06.606 --> 10:08.774
You know, I should
get back to the treadmill.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.235
(chuckles)

10:12.194 --> 10:15.197
He exercises so much,
but he looks the same.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.116
I guess the weight
will all come off at once,

10:17.199 --> 10:18.451
some day in the future.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.579
Don't you believe
anything Homer says.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.956
His first word was a lie.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.417
Who did this?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.294
-Mommy.
-She did?!

10:28.377 --> 10:29.962
Then I'm gonna
withhold affection

10:30.046 --> 10:32.214
without telling her why.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.675
(dramatic music playing)

10:43.809 --> 10:45.353
(groans)
Huh?

10:46.354 --> 10:49.106
<i>Don't believe anything you were</i>
<i>told by me in the past,</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.067
because that was not me.
But this is me now.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.027
But in less than a second,
I'll be gone forever.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.028
(roaring)

10:54.111 --> 10:56.364
I might be back!

10:58.783 --> 11:00.785
(gasps)
The lava being!

11:00.868 --> 11:04.830
That's why they showed a clip
of it on "previously on."

11:04.914 --> 11:06.290
MARGE:
Homer!

11:06.374 --> 11:08.584
You're using your
expensive new treadmill

11:08.668 --> 11:12.129
just to watch a show that went
off the air five years ago?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.423
And when I wanted
to watch it with you then,

11:14.507 --> 11:17.343
you said it was
pretentious and repetitive.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.388
Marge, there're so many
mysteries I need to have solved.

11:20.471 --> 11:24.016
Now, if the Korean couple
can't speak English,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.018
why were they doing
a crossword puzzle

11:26.102 --> 11:29.855
where the answer to 23 down was
"enigma" spelled backwards?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.482
What does it mean?

11:31.565 --> 11:35.236
It means use the treadmill
for running or take it back!

11:35.319 --> 11:36.737
And where will I watch TV?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.406
On the TV!

11:38.489 --> 11:40.157
And where will I walk?!

11:40.241 --> 11:41.742
On the ground!

11:41.826 --> 11:44.662
-And where...
-This is the stupidest fight ever!

11:44.745 --> 11:46.747
We've had stupider!

11:46.831 --> 11:48.207
I don't think so.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.458
(slurps)

11:49.542 --> 11:51.377
JIMBO:
Hey, Fart-tholomew.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.005
You did a sweet job
watching my woman yesterday.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.925
(both moaning)

11:58.008 --> 11:59.885
So, what do you
want to do now?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.513
What any boy would: push you in
a puddle and run away.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.724
Maybe I should be
faithful to Jimbo.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.518
He's bought me a lot of gum
over the past couple months.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.353
Listen...

12:09.437 --> 12:12.148
I could get wedgied for this,
but Jimbo's a jerk.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.524
You can do better.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.985
Wow. You told me
what's best for me...

12:16.068 --> 12:17.987
at risk to yourself.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.947
-Come with me.
-(gulps)

12:20.030 --> 12:22.533
Shauna,
I forgot to grope you good-bye.

12:22.616 --> 12:26.245
(both moaning)

12:30.416 --> 12:33.002
At last!
This episode promises

12:33.085 --> 12:35.045
to finally answer
one question.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.338
Whoo-ho-ho-ho...

12:36.422 --> 12:37.840
-MARGE: Homie!
-(shouts)

12:37.923 --> 12:41.010
The kids are away
and Maggie's napping...

12:42.094 --> 12:44.013
Ooh, that's great.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.015
Can it wait another
104 hours?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.516
-MARGE: Oh!
-(slams door)

12:47.600 --> 12:48.934
She walked away

12:49.018 --> 12:51.187
and slammed the door.
What does it mean?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.688
What does it mean?!

12:52.772 --> 12:54.482
MARGE:
It means I'm mad!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.984
Oh, that's such
a first-take answer!

12:58.194 --> 13:00.613

Simpson, I guess you don't
have much respect for me.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.883
Well, who wears
a wool hat to a pool?

14:02.967 --> 14:03.884
(grunts)

14:05.469 --> 14:07.096
(laughing)

14:07.179 --> 14:10.140
It's not fair!
You know that's hilarious!

14:10.224 --> 14:11.892
(grunts)

14:11.976 --> 14:13.978
-(grunts)
-(whistle blows)

14:14.061 --> 14:16.063
No horseplay
in the pool area.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.692
This isn't play;
this is some serious payback.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.652
Well, that's, um...

14:21.735 --> 14:23.863
All right, you may
have found a loophole.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.615
All right, I better check.
Hello, Abby?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.952
I'm not calling about
the shift change! God!

14:30.035 --> 14:31.203
But, well, since
you bring it up,

14:31.287 --> 14:33.414
if there's a way to flip
Saturday with next Wednesday...

14:33.497 --> 14:36.250
Simpson, prepare to...

14:37.334 --> 14:39.003
Hey, no running on the deck!

14:39.086 --> 14:40.421
I'm on the grass apron!

14:42.006 --> 14:45.968
Huh? Ugh, everyone's
a swimming pool lawyer.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.996
Oh, thank God.
Mom will pound them.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.333
Why, if it isn't Jimbo,
Dorf and Ernie.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.584
(all laugh)

15:18.667 --> 15:20.169
Dorf.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.421
Bart's not home yet,
but I'm always looking

15:22.504 --> 15:24.757
to encourage non-Milhouse
play dates.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.925
Stick around!

15:26.008 --> 15:26.926
Oh...

15:27.009 --> 15:28.260
Hey, Bart.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.262
Oh, it's you.
(moaning)

15:30.346 --> 15:32.681
Why do men always think
with their tongue?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.266
I came to help you.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.519
Then go back to Jimbo and show
him every boob you've got.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.940
But you told me he was a jerk
and that I could do better.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.569
(groans)

15:45.653 --> 15:48.572
All right. Follow me
to a place where nerds,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.449
dorks and dweebs can
gather in safety.

15:50.532 --> 15:54.328
This isn't, like, some creepy
place under an off-ramp?

15:54.411 --> 15:56.372
Okay,
we'll go to my second choice.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.084
Now you be careful
with Bart's undies.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.544
We will, Mrs. Simpson.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.965
Think of this as your
personal Asgard,

16:06.048 --> 16:09.301
and I, the all-seeing Heimdall,
guardian of the gate.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.594
All-seeing?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.138
Yeah, when's the last time
you saw your feet?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.848
Oh, that's it!

16:14.932 --> 16:16.725
Fellow bullies, I've got them!

16:16.809 --> 16:19.228
We'll be right there.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.646
You're a bully?

16:20.729 --> 16:21.814
A cyber bully.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.482
Anything I do,
it is important that

16:23.565 --> 16:24.942
I can lie down while doing it.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.402
-(phone chimes)
-Huh?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.988
You just got yourself
in a flame war...

16:29.071 --> 16:31.407
with a teenage girl.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.325
Oh, flame on!

16:42.584 --> 16:43.711
Oh! Oh!

16:43.794 --> 16:47.464
You have cloven me from my
ponytail to my slipper shoe!

16:47.548 --> 16:48.966
(sobs)
Get out!

16:49.049 --> 16:50.342
And never return!

16:50.426 --> 16:52.261
Oh, unless you want
to buy old Archie comics.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.138
20 pound bricks
are a dollar.

16:56.724 --> 17:00.561
Thank you all for coming
to my <i>Stranded</i> discussion group.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.895
Hey, I loved that show.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.939
Wasn't it awesome when
Colonel Darkwater...

17:04.023 --> 17:05.399
-(horn blares)
-Spoiler alert!

17:05.482 --> 17:07.192
I've only seen
up to season three,

17:07.276 --> 17:09.903
episode 17:
"Coconut Cream Die."

17:09.987 --> 17:13.574
So you don't know that season five
was a complete wank?

17:13.657 --> 17:14.908
-(blaring)
-Spoiler!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.618
Homer, calm down.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.079
It's not like any of this stuff
really took place.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.748
(blaring)

17:20.831 --> 17:22.332
Spoiler!

17:22.416 --> 17:23.959
Homer, for God sakes,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.378
I'm trying to put
Maggie to sleep.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.547
(baby talk)
I'm sorry, sweetie.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.258
It's a Strandie
discussion group.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.468
Yes, it is!

17:32.551 --> 17:35.054
We discuss why airplane
go crash-crash

17:35.137 --> 17:37.056
but people don't die-die.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.349
You wanna know what happens
on your stupid show?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.268
Firstly, the "mysterious island"

17:41.351 --> 17:43.604
is 15 miles from Long Beach.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.773
Also, Doorway Three led to Hell

17:45.856 --> 17:48.358
despite the series creators'
repeated insistence

17:48.442 --> 17:51.528
it did not lead to Hell,
and the entire Strandiverse,

17:51.612 --> 17:54.865
is a piece of gravel
in a cosmic kitty litter box!

17:54.948 --> 17:57.201
(gasps)
Thanks, Marge.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.703
You ruined my show.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.539
Now,
I'm going to give you a spoiler

18:02.623 --> 18:06.502
about our marriage:
it's not great right now.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.170
(gasping)

18:08.253 --> 18:10.047
Well, since this
is a discussion group,

18:10.130 --> 18:11.465
let's discuss.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.008
I think they're having a spat.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.718
I'd say it's more of a tiff.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.053
Oh, so I'm a moron, am I?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.055
Fellas, fellas,
I know where this is going.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.182
Give me
all your weapons now.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.352
(grunts)

18:23.435 --> 18:27.940
Now it's time to talk about
what Carl wants.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.577
Oh, man, they have every
entrance covered.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.122
You'd have to be
a Navy SEAL to get in or out.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.665
LISA:
Hello, lovebirds.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.874
Whoa!

18:45.958 --> 18:47.376
What are you doing here?

18:47.459 --> 18:50.379
I've been following your storyline
from afar, Bart,

18:50.462 --> 18:51.839
waiting for that inevitable point

18:51.922 --> 18:54.049
where you get into trouble
you couldn't get out of.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.301
Perhaps I could
broker a settlement.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.303
Well, that's my boyfriend,
but he's a wad.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.097
And your brother's
not a wad-- he's a dink

19:00.180 --> 19:01.849
on the road to doofus.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.350
Hear, hear.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.518
Ow.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.938
The lamb has returned
to the slaughter.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.731
Whoa, you should
write that down, man.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.024
I'll remember it.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.862
I don't think Shauna
should choose any of you.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.197
Shauna should choose Shauna.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.324
Your older sister's right, Bart.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.868
You don't want me?

19:20.951 --> 19:22.995
I want to find out who I am.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.872
And that's something only

19:24.955 --> 19:26.915
an inappropriately
older man can tell me.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.669
Well, that is one
lucky creepy guy.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.838
MARGE: Lisa, are you
out there in your slippers?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.673
Come inside!

19:34.756 --> 19:37.134
Well, Bart, I guess
that's our cue to skedaddle...

19:37.217 --> 19:39.094
Not so fast, Simpson...

19:39.178 --> 19:41.346
Uh, what was that thing
I was gonna do to him?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.890
Told you you should've
written it down.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.226
If I wrote down everything
you told me to write down,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.395
I'd have no time for punching.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.564
Whoa, you should
write that down, man.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.443
Lousy Marge...

19:54.526 --> 19:56.987
ruining the delicate
relationship

19:57.070 --> 19:59.072
between a man and his TV show.

19:59.156 --> 20:03.076
I'd tell my best friend,
but that's Marge too.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.662
MARGE:
Homie, come in the bedroom.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.248
(gasps)

20:08.332 --> 20:13.086
Care to join me in a private
last episode party?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.255
Well...

20:15.339 --> 20:16.590
It's okay, Dad.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.550
He's just putting
the fear of God in me.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.344
Okay, but if this house
starts a-rockin',

20:20.427 --> 20:22.095
don't come a-knockin'.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.097
Have a wonderful evening, sir.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.768
(moaning, smooching)

20:42.157 --> 20:46.245
-Purr-plexing, isn't it?
-HOMER: D'oh!

21:32.416 --> 21:33.750
Shh!
