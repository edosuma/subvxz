WEBVTT

00:07.549 --> 00:08.818
Why didn't he just tell me

00:08.853 --> 00:09.984
he was changing?

00:10.019 --> 00:12.772
He didn't want anyone
to know.

00:12.807 --> 00:15.525
And I promised him
no one would.

01:52.142 --> 01:54.178
What's up?

01:54.213 --> 01:55.313
Hey.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.378
Hey.

01:56.413 --> 01:58.115
So, I'm probably the last guy

01:58.150 --> 02:00.007
you expected to hear from, huh?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.517
Uh, not the last,

02:01.552 --> 02:03.852
but definitely
down there.

02:03.887 --> 02:06.122
Look, I know you quit
the force and everything,

02:06.157 --> 02:08.358
but damned if this one
doesn't have your name

02:08.393 --> 02:09.693
written all over it.

02:11.095 --> 02:12.362
Since when did you start
appreciating my take

02:12.397 --> 02:13.929
on crime scenes?

02:13.964 --> 02:16.400
The minute we rolled away
from this one.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.101
A suicide

02:19.136 --> 02:21.070
two nights ago
in the river district.

02:21.105 --> 02:23.474
Referred to homicide
so we could vet the wife's claim

02:23.509 --> 02:25.142
that her husband shot himself
in the chest.

02:26.677 --> 02:28.510
The chest...

02:28.545 --> 02:30.681
men tend to shoot themselves
in the head.

02:30.716 --> 02:31.882
Women usually favor the chest.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.882
So I'm told.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.120
Any other reason to think
this isn't a suicide?

02:36.155 --> 02:38.689
Well, crime lab's
still processing.

02:38.724 --> 02:39.957
Neighbors heard
shouting.

02:39.992 --> 02:41.356
No sign
of break-in.

02:41.391 --> 02:42.758
The wife
and 17-year-old son

02:42.793 --> 02:44.995
are the only ones
that were inside.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.998
She's claiming
the husband snapped.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.966
Kid's not saying
anything at all.

02:49.001 --> 02:50.434
Well, that makes sense.

02:50.469 --> 02:52.134
He's traumatized.

02:52.169 --> 02:53.704
The shrink that took over
when you left,

02:53.739 --> 02:55.170
Dr. Mehtar,

02:55.205 --> 02:57.541
he's calling the boy
a high-functioning autistic.

02:57.576 --> 02:59.376
Some kind of syndrome
or something.

02:59.411 --> 03:01.212
Asperger's.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.978
That's the one.

03:03.013 --> 03:05.232
Okay, so you've got
a troubled teen

03:05.267 --> 03:07.451
and the possible suicide
of his father.

03:07.486 --> 03:10.052
Not getting
why you called me.

03:10.087 --> 03:14.057
I thought maybe you could
make some sense of this.

03:17.294 --> 03:18.395
The kid draw this?

03:18.430 --> 03:19.595
Yup.

03:19.630 --> 03:20.798
He was drawing it when
the shooting happened,

03:20.833 --> 03:22.664
according to
the mother anyway.

03:22.699 --> 03:24.868
Does these in less
than a minute, I'm told.

03:24.903 --> 03:27.070
And he draws them
without looking.

03:27.105 --> 03:28.036
Wow.

03:28.071 --> 03:29.805
That's quite the savant.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.308
Yeah. Here,
check out the rest.

03:31.343 --> 03:34.178
Look at that.

03:38.982 --> 03:40.249
So, what does that
tell you, huh?

03:40.284 --> 03:42.886
This kid's insides
are twisted in knots.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.492
He draws these
from life.

03:50.861 --> 03:51.927
That's a joke.

03:51.962 --> 03:53.580
That's just a joke...

03:53.615 --> 03:55.391
look, I just figured
you were the guy

03:55.426 --> 03:57.167
who loves all these
oddball cases, so...

03:57.202 --> 03:59.837
yeah, these are
brilliant.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.472
I mean, they're disturbing,

04:02.507 --> 04:03.839
but they're brilliant.

04:03.874 --> 04:04.973
Yeah, we found
hundreds more of them

04:05.008 --> 04:06.510
rolled up on butcher paper
in the closet.

04:06.545 --> 04:08.677
When can I
talk to him?

04:08.712 --> 04:10.078
I already got a friendly Judge

04:10.113 --> 04:12.082
to steer you
the psych evaluation.

04:12.117 --> 04:13.582
Ah?

04:13.617 --> 04:17.187
One catch...
you've only got 48 hours.

04:23.193 --> 04:25.896
So these are obviously
his demons,

04:25.931 --> 04:27.996
nightmares
brought to life.

04:28.031 --> 04:29.832
I'm reminded
of Hieronymus Bosch.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.335
His paintings were rife
with abnormals.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.569
Was Bosch a friend of yours?

04:33.604 --> 04:36.071
High school sweetheart
or something?

04:36.106 --> 04:39.343
There is such a thing as
"before my time."

04:39.378 --> 04:40.309
Really?

04:40.344 --> 04:42.144
Cheeky monkey.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.579
Okay, check this out.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.482
Here's one I found
particularly interesting.

04:45.517 --> 04:47.217
Oh,
it's the sanctuary.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.183
Yeah.

04:48.218 --> 04:50.320
His
draftsmanship is uncanny.

04:50.355 --> 04:52.054
Photographic
in its fidelity.

04:52.089 --> 04:54.258
Yeah, he must have used
computer imaging for this.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.460
Cavanaugh said the boy
was home-schooled,

04:56.495 --> 04:57.459
and apparently,
the father

04:57.494 --> 04:59.363
wouldn't allow him
access to the computer.

04:59.398 --> 05:01.029
Okay, so he copied
a photo, then.

05:01.064 --> 05:04.134
Well, the mother said
he flew over Old City once

05:04.169 --> 05:07.204
on the only airplane trip
he ever took in his life.

05:07.239 --> 05:09.271
10 years ago.

05:09.306 --> 05:10.724
Yeah, exactly 10.
How did you know?

05:10.759 --> 05:12.142
That's when we did
the renovation work

05:12.177 --> 05:14.042
on the North Tower.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.979
Okay, but the part about
not needing to see the page,

05:16.014 --> 05:17.212
how does that work?

05:17.247 --> 05:19.348
Well, if the anecdotal
evidence is true,

05:19.383 --> 05:21.351
then the boy must bypass
the role of ordinary sight.

05:21.386 --> 05:23.320
There's not much doubt
about his being a savant.

05:23.355 --> 05:25.454
He may well be more than that.

05:25.489 --> 05:26.690
Now, the police are
obviously more interested

05:26.725 --> 05:28.523
in how the father died

05:28.558 --> 05:30.260
than in the boy's
potential abnormality.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.760
Understandably.

05:31.795 --> 05:33.263
I've been given a temporary
pipeline to the case file.

05:33.298 --> 05:34.998
We can get their forensics
in realtime.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.031
What about the family?

05:36.066 --> 05:37.699
Cavanaugh's made arrangements

05:37.734 --> 05:39.169
for the boy and his mother
to visit us here,

05:39.204 --> 05:40.402
and I was hoping

05:40.437 --> 05:41.438
maybe you'd have time
to be part of that?

05:41.473 --> 05:43.440
Wouldn't miss it.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.208
Okay, cool.

06:04.528 --> 06:06.379
Henry...

06:06.414 --> 06:08.231
food.

06:25.549 --> 06:28.051
Henry?

06:45.135 --> 06:47.437
He's my father, isn't he?

06:58.849 --> 07:00.934
They always did call you
a "heartbreaker"

07:00.969 --> 07:03.020
from the time I had you
in a stroller.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.572
Come on,
those were old geezers

07:04.607 --> 07:06.089
playing checkers
in the park.

07:08.725 --> 07:10.527
You didn't say anything
on the flight back from Rome.

07:10.562 --> 07:12.596
In fact, you haven't
spoken to me

07:12.631 --> 07:13.929
since we got back.

07:13.964 --> 07:15.365
Yeah, well,
what's there to say?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.900
Maybe that
you're angry?

07:16.935 --> 07:17.933
Feeling betrayed...

07:17.968 --> 07:19.267
Don't put words
in my mouth.

07:19.302 --> 07:20.502
I'm trying to get
words out of you.

07:20.537 --> 07:22.139
Mom, I understand
what your motives were.

07:22.174 --> 07:23.273
There were no
good choices.

07:23.308 --> 07:24.673
I don't fault you.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.341
I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

07:26.376 --> 07:29.446
Okay, well, you were worried
about my feelings, right?

07:31.882 --> 07:33.215
I put you in harm's way

07:33.250 --> 07:34.384
with every swing
of the pendulum,

07:34.419 --> 07:36.487
but the truth is, Ashley,

07:36.522 --> 07:38.555
I can't bear to see you hurt.

07:41.058 --> 07:42.459
What really hurt
wasn't the news.

07:42.494 --> 07:43.860
It was that
it didn't come from you.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.701
Our sympathies for
your loss, Mrs. Meyers.

07:51.736 --> 07:54.469
Thank you.

07:54.504 --> 07:56.938
My son will be along.

07:56.973 --> 08:00.293
He found something to draw
in the garden.

08:00.328 --> 08:03.613
He's not quite ready
to talk to strangers.

08:05.348 --> 08:07.751
You have to
understand Edward, he's...

08:07.786 --> 08:10.320
he's a very, um...

08:10.355 --> 08:11.453
special boy.

08:11.488 --> 08:12.554
We've seen his art.

08:12.589 --> 08:15.223
We understand
how special he is.

08:15.258 --> 08:19.296
He's done that since he first
picked up a crayon.

08:19.331 --> 08:21.631
His subjects haven't always
been so dark.

08:21.666 --> 08:26.636
He drew this
of Robbie and me

08:26.671 --> 08:28.756
when he was only eight.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.841
Robbie's your other son?

08:31.842 --> 08:33.308
Yeah.

08:33.342 --> 08:34.910
He ran away when he was 14.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.514
I'm sorry.

08:41.284 --> 08:44.221
The file said
that Robbie got into trouble

08:44.256 --> 08:45.520
for starting fires?

08:45.555 --> 08:47.290
Oh, no, no,
he'd stopped all that,

08:47.325 --> 08:49.793
but Glen, he-he...

08:49.828 --> 08:52.262
drove him away.

08:59.336 --> 09:02.939
Was your husband...
abusive to all of you?

09:06.343 --> 09:08.912
My... husband was a good man.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.848
He-he had his problems,

09:11.883 --> 09:13.615
but he loved us.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.619
Feeling love
and inflicting pain

09:15.654 --> 09:16.920
aren't mutually exclusive.

09:16.955 --> 09:19.223
When you're a mother,

09:19.258 --> 09:21.025
protecting your children,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.792
that's all that matters.

09:26.263 --> 09:27.998
Can you tell us what happened
the night that Glen died?

09:31.201 --> 09:32.334
I woke up to the shouting.

09:32.369 --> 09:34.838
You don't think
I see it, huh?

09:34.873 --> 09:37.305
Laughing at your old man?

09:37.340 --> 09:39.009
Hey, you look at me
when I talk to you!

09:39.044 --> 09:40.342
He'd been drinking.

09:40.377 --> 09:42.012
I said look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

09:42.047 --> 09:43.512
I'm sorry.

09:43.547 --> 09:45.282
Stop it.
Stop it...

09:45.317 --> 09:46.982
put the gun down.

09:47.017 --> 09:49.653
I was afraid the gun
would go off accidentally,

09:49.688 --> 09:51.789
and then...

09:53.890 --> 09:55.992
Just like that,
he turned the gun on himself.

09:56.027 --> 09:59.796
I called 911,
but it was too late.

09:59.831 --> 10:03.565
I realize now that...

10:03.600 --> 10:05.769
Glen would never
have hurt Edward,

10:05.804 --> 10:06.868
or anyone else.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.069
This wasn't the first time

10:08.104 --> 10:08.939
that he'd tried
to take his life.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.872
It was...

10:10.907 --> 10:12.976
just so you know,
the evaluation with Edward,

10:13.011 --> 10:14.611
it may take a few sessions.

10:15.645 --> 10:18.280
But...

10:18.315 --> 10:19.881
I'm at wit's end, honestly.

10:19.916 --> 10:22.252
I have to deal with
the funeral arrangements,

10:22.287 --> 10:25.020
and-and Edward, he's...

10:25.055 --> 10:26.589
scared to sleep
in the room

10:26.624 --> 10:28.089
where it all
happened. I...

10:28.124 --> 10:29.593
you're welcome
to leave him in our care.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.760
Oh.

10:31.795 --> 10:33.930
I... I...

10:41.838 --> 10:43.773
how's it going?

10:46.543 --> 10:47.644
My name's Will.

10:49.446 --> 10:51.514
I think your artwork
is pretty awesome.

10:51.549 --> 10:53.548
I've always admired
people who could draw.

10:53.583 --> 10:57.053
I could never get much past
stick figures myself.

10:58.855 --> 11:01.423
Edward?

11:01.458 --> 11:03.943
Dr. Magnus
and Dr. Zimmerman, um...

11:03.978 --> 11:06.429
they're going to
take care of you

11:06.464 --> 11:07.664
for a couple of days.

11:07.699 --> 11:08.763
No, no, no.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.864
Just give me time

11:09.899 --> 11:12.068
to do everything
that I have to do.

11:12.103 --> 11:13.754
Edward...

11:13.789 --> 11:15.370
it's okay.

11:15.405 --> 11:16.806
It's okay,
it's okay...

11:16.841 --> 11:18.609
it's okay.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.342
Come here.

11:20.377 --> 11:21.344
It's gonna be okay.

11:31.855 --> 11:34.589
Any luck with Henry?

11:34.624 --> 11:38.728
He still won't
come out of his room.

11:38.763 --> 11:42.832
This has been
the rudest of awakenings.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.033
I worry

11:45.068 --> 11:48.038
that he will keep
spiraling down.

11:48.073 --> 11:50.972
We can provide every support,

11:51.007 --> 11:53.410
but only Henry can come to terms
with what he's becoming.

12:42.838 --> 12:43.939
It's nice to see you, Henry.

12:43.974 --> 12:45.858
I know I've been M.I.A.

12:45.893 --> 12:47.535
I'm sorry about that.

12:47.570 --> 12:49.143
I more than
understand.

12:49.178 --> 12:51.180
It's not like
you didn't warn me

12:51.215 --> 12:52.813
this day was coming.

12:52.848 --> 12:55.484
Doesn't make it any
easier, though, does it?

12:56.919 --> 12:58.153
I've been catching up
on some research

12:58.188 --> 13:00.556
that's long overdue
on my, uh...

13:00.591 --> 13:03.192
bad self.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.128
I never wanted to know
any of this.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.799
Just figured if I ignored it,
it'd just go away.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.401
You know, kind of like
having some disease,

13:12.436 --> 13:14.053
but being all about denying it.

13:14.088 --> 13:15.671
This isn't a disease, Henry.

13:15.706 --> 13:16.937
I can't sleep,

13:16.972 --> 13:19.842
and smells are out of control.

13:19.877 --> 13:21.308
Food tastes terrible.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.945
We both need to figure out
this phenomenon.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.981
You weren't there.

13:27.016 --> 13:29.084
You weren't there,
and you didn't see it!

13:30.819 --> 13:31.785
If anything
had happened to you,

13:31.820 --> 13:33.522
I would never
have forgiven myself...

13:33.557 --> 13:35.189
well, something did
happen to me,

13:35.224 --> 13:36.792
and all I know is,
I can't control it.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.027
Not as yet, no, but...

13:38.062 --> 13:39.627
look, doc,

13:39.662 --> 13:42.915
I have spent my adult life
working with abnormals,

13:42.950 --> 13:46.168
learning to accept them,
even appreciate them,

13:46.203 --> 13:47.770
but now I am one...

13:50.039 --> 13:52.942
and I'm terrified.

13:54.578 --> 13:56.010
I often wonder

13:56.045 --> 13:58.013
what would have become of you

13:58.048 --> 13:59.982
if I'd left you on the Moors...

14:01.951 --> 14:04.286
to be raised by your kind.

14:05.955 --> 14:07.421
Well...

14:07.456 --> 14:09.224
at least that way
I wouldn't miss being human.

14:09.259 --> 14:12.227
Oh, Henry...

14:20.537 --> 14:22.972
Yes.

14:28.177 --> 14:30.496
I saw your light was on.

14:30.531 --> 14:32.815
Am I disturbing you?

14:35.718 --> 14:38.120
Mind if I come in?

15:02.845 --> 15:05.381
Where do these come from?

15:05.416 --> 15:06.949
These creatures?

15:06.984 --> 15:08.317
From here.

15:17.059 --> 15:18.861
Does it help to draw them?

15:18.896 --> 15:23.731
Make it less scary?

15:23.766 --> 15:26.301
There were pictures
of Robbie, too.

15:26.336 --> 15:27.403
Your brother.

15:29.672 --> 15:31.240
You must
miss him a lot.

15:36.245 --> 15:38.981
When you drew that picture
that night,

15:39.016 --> 15:40.282
of the monster holding the gun?

15:42.718 --> 15:44.887
Did you see what happened?

15:46.021 --> 15:47.189
How your father
died?

15:47.224 --> 15:48.891
I can't think.

15:53.162 --> 15:56.563
Okay.

15:56.598 --> 15:58.701
Maybe we can talk again
when you're not so tired.

16:01.103 --> 16:04.273
Good night.

16:08.444 --> 16:11.747
Mm... huhh.

16:19.088 --> 16:20.354
Don't worry, Edward,

16:20.389 --> 16:22.124
this machine simply
measures your eye movements

16:22.159 --> 16:23.125
while you draw.

16:29.064 --> 16:30.866
What do you want me to draw?

16:30.901 --> 16:32.099
Anything
from memory.

16:32.134 --> 16:33.936
Is there something
you'd like to suggest?

16:33.971 --> 16:36.322
Doesn't matter.

16:36.357 --> 16:38.639
All right, um...

16:38.674 --> 16:40.175
have you ever been
to Chinatown?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.082
When most people see,

17:22.117 --> 17:23.919
their focus shifts
from one area of interest

17:23.954 --> 17:25.219
to another.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.755
When we remember,
we interpolate,

17:26.790 --> 17:27.988
we fill in the blanks.

17:28.022 --> 17:29.524
Which is why
eyewitness testimony

17:29.559 --> 17:31.026
is so notoriously
unreliable.

17:31.061 --> 17:32.359
Exactly.

17:32.394 --> 17:34.329
Now, Edward's visual apparatus,
on the other hand,

17:34.364 --> 17:36.148
acts more like an image scanner,

17:36.183 --> 17:37.933
rapidly moving
in parallel sweeps,

17:37.968 --> 17:38.966
and then archiving.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.720
So he really is
a living computer.

17:41.755 --> 17:44.439
This rendering
took less than a minute

17:44.474 --> 17:45.474
from start to finish.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.308
Wow.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.511
The detail is extraordinary.

17:50.546 --> 17:53.514
With respect,
this is what's extraordinary.

17:53.549 --> 17:56.518
I asked Edward to concentrate
on one portion of the scene,

17:56.553 --> 17:58.085
this area here,

17:58.120 --> 18:02.691
and then,
a zoom on the zoom...

18:02.726 --> 18:03.991
in this case,

18:04.026 --> 18:06.795
a face, just barely visible
in the shadows,

18:06.830 --> 18:08.414
becomes this.

18:08.449 --> 18:09.963
Okay, so,

18:09.998 --> 18:11.899
I'm not sure I get this.

18:11.934 --> 18:13.035
Edward's got this
"Where's Waldo" thing

18:13.070 --> 18:14.136
going on
with abnormals?

18:14.171 --> 18:15.369
And that's assuming

18:15.404 --> 18:16.804
there wasn't an abnormal
in the doorway.

18:16.839 --> 18:19.041
Perhaps he sees the monster
that lurks beneath.

18:19.076 --> 18:20.474
So, what are you saying?

18:20.509 --> 18:22.042
He detects
the abnormals amongst us?

18:22.077 --> 18:25.180
Or simply the true personas
of damaged people.

18:25.215 --> 18:28.050
So an abusive father
becomes a monster.

18:28.085 --> 18:29.716
Exactly.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.395
Hey.

18:43.131 --> 18:45.334
You don't have to
turn it off.

18:45.369 --> 18:49.536
I've seen it.

18:49.571 --> 18:53.709
Is this where
some of them come from?

18:53.744 --> 18:55.909
The monsters?

18:55.944 --> 18:58.847
I draw what I see.

19:00.215 --> 19:02.451
You know, I see them, too.

19:02.486 --> 19:03.851
Really?

19:03.886 --> 19:06.855
We actually have
a lot in common, you and I.

19:06.890 --> 19:07.821
Hmm.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.490
Details jump out at me,

19:10.525 --> 19:12.461
things that go right by
other people.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.132
Like right now, I can see signs

19:19.167 --> 19:22.104
that you're afraid to
tell me what you know.

19:30.345 --> 19:31.947
That drawing
from the other night...

19:33.417 --> 19:34.982
The creature...

19:35.017 --> 19:36.884
that was your father.

19:36.919 --> 19:39.221
He... he wasn't
always like that.

19:39.256 --> 19:41.154
He could be nice.

19:41.189 --> 19:43.274
He wasn't nice
that night.

19:43.309 --> 19:45.360
He pointed the gun at you.

19:45.395 --> 19:46.827
To scare me.

19:46.862 --> 19:48.463
He'd never hurt me.

19:51.533 --> 19:53.433
You're seeing it.

19:53.468 --> 19:55.369
You don't know
what I'm seeing.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.806
Of course not.
Your thoughts are yours.

19:57.841 --> 19:58.839
Mine are mine.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.108
You only share them
if you want to.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.516
How did he die, Edward?

20:07.551 --> 20:08.350
Was it Robbie?

20:08.385 --> 20:09.149
No.

20:09.184 --> 20:10.018
Did he come back?

20:10.053 --> 20:11.585
No.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.721
Then why are you
thinking about him...

20:12.756 --> 20:14.156
you said
they were my thoughts.

20:14.191 --> 20:15.589
How did your father die?

20:15.624 --> 20:17.524
Did Robbie shoot
your father?

20:17.559 --> 20:20.662
Hey! You look at me
when I talk to you!

20:20.697 --> 20:22.064
I said look at me!

20:23.467 --> 20:24.631
I...

20:24.666 --> 20:26.268
I thought
I was going to die.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.444
I grabbed the gun.

20:43.652 --> 20:45.253
I didn't mean to kill him.

20:55.551 --> 20:57.084
We've been able to verify

20:57.119 --> 20:59.054
that your body has entered
a new metamorphic phase.

20:59.089 --> 21:01.057
Everything we know
about proteans tells us

21:01.092 --> 21:03.276
they continue to evolve
over their lifetimes.

21:03.311 --> 21:05.461
There may be powers
or abilities that you gain

21:05.496 --> 21:06.995
that we can't even hope
to fathom.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.329
Imagine
a caterpillar

21:09.364 --> 21:12.401
arresting its metamorphosis
before it becomes a butterfly.

21:12.436 --> 21:13.936
You really think
it was a butterfly

21:13.971 --> 21:15.437
that brought down
that snake creature?

21:15.472 --> 21:16.772
Look, I can't
account for myself

21:16.807 --> 21:17.805
when I'm that thing.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.976
I mean,
what if I hurt one of you?

21:21.011 --> 21:23.310
I can't
let that happen.

21:23.345 --> 21:26.898
So you either
chain me up in the shoe

21:26.933 --> 21:30.144
or you tell me
how I can stop all this.

21:30.179 --> 21:33.355
I need to know
what my choices are.

21:37.059 --> 21:39.011
There is a surgical remedy,

21:39.046 --> 21:40.928
but it's not without its risks.

21:40.963 --> 21:43.198
It involves excising portions
of both the pituitary

21:43.233 --> 21:44.164
and pineal glands.

21:44.199 --> 21:46.034
If it'll keep me human,
bring it on.

21:47.302 --> 21:49.938
I want you to think about this
long and hard, Henry.

21:49.973 --> 21:51.507
Okay.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.041
Done.

21:54.643 --> 21:56.845
It could well impact
who you are,

21:56.880 --> 21:58.178
how you think.

21:58.213 --> 21:59.581
What, is it some kind of
lobotomy or something?

21:59.616 --> 22:00.881
No, certainly not,

22:00.916 --> 22:02.818
but could it blunt
your intelligence,

22:02.853 --> 22:05.754
alter your personality?

22:08.724 --> 22:10.324
We just don't know.

22:10.359 --> 22:14.963
Promise me
you'll think about it.

22:52.568 --> 22:54.401
The more I look at
the evidence,

22:54.436 --> 22:56.071
the less I believe both Ruth's
and Edward's accounts.

22:56.106 --> 22:57.239
You think they were both
covering for Robbie?

22:57.274 --> 22:58.240
Just a sec.

22:58.275 --> 23:00.307
Hey.

23:00.342 --> 23:01.608
Hey, nice work.

23:01.643 --> 23:03.111
The stain on her robe
was a dead match

23:03.146 --> 23:04.563
for the gun oil on the weapon.

23:04.598 --> 23:05.923
She obviously wiped it down.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.249
I'm getting heat
to book her

23:07.284 --> 23:08.549
just on that.

23:08.584 --> 23:11.019
Hold off, okay?
I need a little more time.

23:11.054 --> 23:12.221
Come on, talk to me.

23:12.256 --> 23:13.353
I saw some things

23:13.388 --> 23:14.521
in the crime-scene photos

23:14.556 --> 23:15.522
I'd like to check out
on-site.

23:15.557 --> 23:17.042
Ooh, I thought
we were going to keep

23:17.077 --> 23:18.527
the investigation side of this
discrete.

23:18.562 --> 23:19.995
Hey, you came to me, remember?

23:20.030 --> 23:21.094
All right.

23:21.129 --> 23:22.329
Oh, and you should know,

23:22.364 --> 23:23.265
Ms. Meyers tried
to take possession

23:23.300 --> 23:24.565
of her husband's body.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.466
Had a quick cremation
all planned.

23:26.501 --> 23:27.703
Well, the M.E.
Didn't release it, right?

23:27.738 --> 23:28.835
Well, of course not,

23:28.870 --> 23:30.872
but it doesn't do much
for the trust factor.

23:30.907 --> 23:32.172
See, this just
doesn't feel right.

23:32.207 --> 23:33.574
That's why I need to see
the apartment.

23:33.609 --> 23:35.944
I'll call the wife,
let her know you're coming.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.380
Okay, thanks.

24:53.422 --> 24:56.123
Please...

24:56.158 --> 24:58.393
Please! Please!

24:58.428 --> 25:00.279
Dad?

25:00.314 --> 25:02.095
Dad!

25:04.667 --> 25:07.100
Let me out!

25:07.135 --> 25:10.072
Oh, god...

25:10.107 --> 25:13.275
oh, God. Oh...

25:18.083 --> 25:19.551
Who did he keep
down there?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.019
It's not what you think.

25:21.054 --> 25:22.953
What about Robbie?

25:22.988 --> 25:24.973
He got the brunt of it,
didn't he?

25:25.008 --> 25:26.958
What did Glen call it,
discipline?

25:28.393 --> 25:32.831
In my experience,
it's often a cover for cruelty.

25:36.835 --> 25:37.902
He threatened you,
didn't he?

25:37.937 --> 25:39.135
He...

25:39.170 --> 25:42.523
he said he'd take the boys,

25:42.558 --> 25:45.842
take Robbie and Edward,

25:45.877 --> 25:48.062
if I ever tried to leave him.

25:48.097 --> 25:50.213
The file said
that you didn't

25:50.248 --> 25:51.883
report Robbie as missing
for almost five days.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.853
Glen didn't want to go
to the police,

25:54.888 --> 25:57.854
in case Robbie showed up.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.058
Then you'll appreciate
how important it is

26:00.093 --> 26:03.395
I report
any new evidence.

26:03.430 --> 26:05.797
But you...

26:05.832 --> 26:07.966
oh, ple... oh...

26:12.937 --> 26:14.305
will, I wasn't
entirely comfortable

26:14.340 --> 26:15.739
with you making it sound

26:15.774 --> 26:18.143
as if the sanctuary
were an arm of law enforcement.

26:18.178 --> 26:20.512
Well, I had to push her
to get at what she was hiding.

26:20.547 --> 26:22.765
The unraveling
of who killed this man and why

26:22.800 --> 26:24.983
may well yield a treasure trove
of information

26:25.018 --> 26:26.485
about this abnormality,

26:26.520 --> 26:27.917
but make no mistake,

26:27.952 --> 26:30.221
I will not help
compound an injustice.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.655
So, what are you saying?

26:31.690 --> 26:34.059
That we withhold evidence
from the authorities?

26:34.094 --> 26:35.778
If it's in service
of preserving

26:35.813 --> 26:37.427
an extraordinary life
like Edward's

26:37.462 --> 26:39.664
or the mother who tried
to protect those sons?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.399
You'd better know
that I would.

26:43.401 --> 26:47.205
Then I guess one of us
is going to be uncomfortable.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.538
Either way,
it's down to us

26:48.573 --> 26:49.991
to sort out
what really happened,

26:50.026 --> 26:51.409
and that means finding Robbie.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.243
I've been thinking,

26:53.278 --> 26:55.380
Edward has
a pixel-perfect record

26:55.415 --> 26:57.013
of his father's
death.

26:57.048 --> 26:58.581
He says he doesn't remember
what happened.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.351
Well, he was able to retrieve
one image from that night.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.152
His father pointing the gun.

27:02.187 --> 27:05.290
You recall I was talking about
the interpolation of data

27:05.325 --> 27:06.491
to make our memories complete.

27:06.526 --> 27:07.557
Yeah.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.761
If we could get Edward
to render key moments

27:09.796 --> 27:11.394
surrounding the fatal shot,

27:11.429 --> 27:12.780
Henry could program
the computer

27:12.815 --> 27:14.124
to fill in
the missing frames.

27:14.159 --> 27:15.563
So we'd have
a movie of the crime?

27:15.598 --> 27:16.968
Or as near
as you can reconstruct

27:17.003 --> 27:18.169
from a person's memories.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.636
Huh.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.404
There's just one problem.

27:21.439 --> 27:23.424
Edward doesn't want
to remember.

27:23.459 --> 27:25.410
Let's get him down here.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.679
There's no harm in trying.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.253
Ah...

28:04.249 --> 28:06.316
I've made up my mind.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.752
I saw the way
that kid looked at me,

28:07.787 --> 28:09.052
and if he can see it,

28:09.087 --> 28:11.222
then it's not far
from surfacing again.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.555
I want this thing gone.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.225
Despite the risks
we've talked about?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.627
That would be correct.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.963
Very well.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.266
I'll schedule the surgery.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.073
Henry...

28:30.108 --> 28:31.509
I think about what
you're about to do

28:31.544 --> 28:32.609
and it scares me.

28:32.644 --> 28:33.645
You get a look at
that thing inside me,

28:33.680 --> 28:35.178
it'll scare you even more.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.080
I just don't want to lose
the Henry I know.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.648
Look, I'm not real thrilled
about it either, Ash,

28:38.683 --> 28:40.418
but no matter what I do,
I'm going to wind up different.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.053
Yeah, but, dude, maybe
the abnormal different

28:42.088 --> 28:43.521
isn't as bad
as you think it might be.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.754
Come on, Ashley,

28:44.789 --> 28:46.322
you're not talking to
an amateur here.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.560
We've both seen the ugly side
of the abnormal world

28:48.595 --> 28:49.559
up close.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.397
We've also seen its wonder.

28:52.432 --> 28:54.098
Its beauty.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.441
You said your father
aimed the shotgun at you,

29:03.476 --> 29:05.376
and that you pulled it away
and shot him.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.579
Can you show us that?

29:07.614 --> 29:09.714
Mmm...

29:52.490 --> 29:55.925
Edward, this is a right hand.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.395
Why is it on the left side
of the image?

29:57.430 --> 29:59.664
Hmm...

30:06.638 --> 30:07.872
this isn't your hand,
is it, Edward?

30:10.341 --> 30:12.377
This right hand
has a scar on it.

30:12.412 --> 30:13.476
Yours doesn't.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.313
I'm guessing
this was Robbie.

30:15.348 --> 30:16.279
No!

30:16.314 --> 30:17.515
It's all right, Edward.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.451
Was Robbie the one
your father was threatening?

30:20.486 --> 30:21.718
Your mom and dad
issued

30:21.753 --> 30:23.021
a full description
of Robbie

30:23.056 --> 30:24.354
when he
went missing.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.924
This scar was one of
the distinguishing marks.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.156
If he was the occupant

30:27.191 --> 30:29.292
of that little room
under the floor,

30:29.327 --> 30:30.962
he'd have more than
enough reason for payback...

30:30.997 --> 30:32.196
I told you it was me!

30:32.231 --> 30:33.363
Right now,

30:33.398 --> 30:34.666
they're this close
to charging your mother

30:34.701 --> 30:36.099
for tampering
with evidence,

30:36.134 --> 30:37.602
and that charge could turn
to murder like that,

30:37.637 --> 30:39.836
unless we can...

30:41.240 --> 30:42.791
Edward!

30:42.826 --> 30:44.218
Edward...

30:44.253 --> 30:45.732
it's okay.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.176
Robbie?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.353
Edward, Edward...

30:55.388 --> 30:56.921
you got him?

30:56.956 --> 30:57.722
Yeah.

31:21.152 --> 31:23.955
What's his condition?

31:23.990 --> 31:26.089
Still guarded.

31:26.124 --> 31:27.390
He suffered
a Grand Mal seizure.

31:27.425 --> 31:29.527
There's still a threat
of subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

31:29.562 --> 31:31.761
I'm sorry.

31:31.796 --> 31:32.897
If I hadn't have
pushed him so hard,

31:32.932 --> 31:34.965
none of this would've happened.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.401
No neurologic deficits
have surfaced,

31:36.436 --> 31:37.467
but clearly now,

31:37.502 --> 31:39.371
we have to err
on the side of caution.

31:39.406 --> 31:40.856
What the hell did we see?

31:40.891 --> 31:42.272
The dark side to his power.

31:42.307 --> 31:44.876
It's like his eyes were
shooting out heat bursts.

31:44.911 --> 31:46.311
That would explain
the scorch marks

31:46.346 --> 31:48.414
on the walls of that chamber.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.383
What about the marks on Ruth?

31:50.418 --> 31:51.968
I can't imagine
that Edward

31:52.003 --> 31:53.645
would have
inflicted those,

31:53.680 --> 31:55.451
at least not intentionally.

31:55.486 --> 31:57.187
And if it was the husband?

31:57.222 --> 31:59.107
Maybe they weren't
cigarette burns at all.

31:59.142 --> 32:00.784
The M.E.'s file
said there was evidence

32:00.819 --> 32:02.427
that the father
suffered seizures as well.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.527
If the father was an abnormal,

32:04.562 --> 32:06.229
he probably passed it on
to Edward.

32:06.264 --> 32:09.200
The father's abnormality
was the burning eyes power.

32:09.235 --> 32:10.502
Hey, what if he could sense

32:10.537 --> 32:12.235
when it was coming on?

32:12.270 --> 32:14.406
And had himself locked away
to protect his loved ones, yes.

32:18.176 --> 32:20.378
Glen Meyers may have
built that chamber for himself.

32:35.093 --> 32:39.929
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

32:39.964 --> 32:43.868
Listen, I know I pushed you
to places in your head

32:43.903 --> 32:45.837
that you weren't ready to go,

32:45.872 --> 32:46.870
and I'm sorry if...

32:46.905 --> 32:50.024
you don't... have to apologize.

32:50.059 --> 32:53.144
Is there anything
I can get you?

32:55.180 --> 32:56.579
My sketch pad.

32:56.614 --> 32:59.217
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

32:59.252 --> 33:00.552
My mom didn't do it.

33:06.424 --> 33:08.259
I can show them.

33:13.898 --> 33:16.368
So obviously, you don't agree
with my decision.

33:16.403 --> 33:18.303
Not for me
to pass judgment.

33:22.574 --> 33:23.875
What would you do?

33:25.343 --> 33:26.443
I'm not the one

33:26.478 --> 33:29.814
trying to purge
his abnormal nature.

33:29.849 --> 33:30.932
But if you could.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.016
Deny who I am?

33:32.051 --> 33:35.485
Why?

33:35.520 --> 33:38.488
I'm not ashamed.

33:38.523 --> 33:40.658
Well, I'm not suggesting
you should be, but...

33:42.727 --> 33:44.596
But what?

33:46.898 --> 33:48.533
I've spent a lifetime
more or less human.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.467
You have yet to discover
your gift.

33:50.502 --> 33:54.072
You think turning into that
mongrelized human is a gift?

33:58.710 --> 34:00.145
Okay, that thing
between my teeth?

34:00.180 --> 34:01.980
That's my foot.

34:02.015 --> 34:03.214
I...

34:04.983 --> 34:07.769
You only see the curse in it.

34:07.804 --> 34:10.554
Every gift comes with one.

34:12.891 --> 34:14.225
What's your curse?

34:16.694 --> 34:18.396
Mm...

34:23.735 --> 34:26.034
now...

34:26.070 --> 34:29.172
you are on this journey
with me.

34:29.208 --> 34:32.060
It's something
you'll discover.

34:32.094 --> 34:34.913
Difference between
you and me is,

34:34.947 --> 34:36.246
you can control your power.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.315
Yeah.

34:39.350 --> 34:41.268
And in time,

34:41.304 --> 34:43.188
so will you.

34:47.692 --> 34:49.027
Now, get to work.

34:51.329 --> 34:52.697
Now, if you feel
the slightest bit uncomfortable,

34:52.732 --> 34:53.982
or you want to quit,

34:54.016 --> 34:55.233
just let me
know, okay?

36:05.403 --> 36:09.541
I think I'm pretty much
ready to go here, boss.

36:09.576 --> 36:10.609
Understand that
the computer tries

36:10.644 --> 36:11.643
to maintain the laws
of both physics

36:11.678 --> 36:12.709
and psychology

36:12.744 --> 36:14.495
when filling in
the blanks.

36:14.530 --> 36:16.247
It's not without its flaws.

36:40.138 --> 36:41.472
Edward...

36:41.507 --> 36:42.807
Edward...

36:57.589 --> 36:58.621
it's not safe.

36:58.656 --> 37:00.123
It's not safe out there.

37:00.158 --> 37:02.393
No, that's what
he wants you to believe, but...

37:03.661 --> 37:05.563
You get away from him, Robbie.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.465
You're not taking him away!

37:12.303 --> 37:14.606
There's nothing
out there but shame

37:14.641 --> 37:16.139
and hate.

37:16.174 --> 37:17.709
I know. I've seen it!

37:21.112 --> 37:22.447
It's different for me and Ed!

37:22.482 --> 37:24.314
He deserves a life!

37:24.349 --> 37:26.250
You get the hell
out of here, Robbie!

37:34.559 --> 37:38.196
I never want you
to experience

37:38.231 --> 37:39.715
the pain that I did.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.199
I'm so, so sorry!

37:41.234 --> 37:42.367
Dad...

37:42.402 --> 37:43.466
Dad!

37:43.501 --> 37:45.637
Dad, please, stop!

37:47.672 --> 37:49.305
Yeah, we still
can't see

37:49.340 --> 37:50.441
whose finger's
on the trigger.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.542
Robbie's body's
blocking it.

37:51.577 --> 37:53.361
Just wait.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.111
There.

37:55.146 --> 37:56.681
The reflection in the mirror
captured it all.

37:56.716 --> 37:58.181
Let go!

37:58.216 --> 37:59.283
Let go
of the gun, Dad!

37:59.318 --> 38:00.869
Stop it!

38:00.904 --> 38:02.385
Stop it!

38:08.860 --> 38:10.228
Robbie lets go
of the gun, and...

38:10.263 --> 38:12.047
get back. Dad...

38:12.082 --> 38:13.690
let go
of the gun!

38:13.725 --> 38:15.299
Stop it, please!

38:15.334 --> 38:16.466
Dad!

38:23.574 --> 38:24.942
The father didn't have to
pull the trigger.

38:27.011 --> 38:37.955
He ignited the charge
directly with his eyes.

38:37.990 --> 38:40.258
Hey, watch the car.

38:40.293 --> 38:41.793
You watch it!

38:44.762 --> 38:46.396
Did you bring
the evidence?

38:46.431 --> 38:48.499
Missing persons,
Robbie Meyers. Unsolved.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.401
Right there.

38:55.406 --> 38:56.708
Look, I know
you want answers...

38:56.743 --> 38:59.243
Yeah, tell me
about it.

38:59.278 --> 39:01.046
What's the matter?

39:01.081 --> 39:02.814
The case, our case,

39:02.849 --> 39:03.946
was pulled.

39:03.981 --> 39:05.817
Erased. Eradicated.

39:05.852 --> 39:07.050
Everything.

39:07.085 --> 39:08.553
The files, crime lab,

39:08.588 --> 39:09.986
ballistics, everything.

39:10.021 --> 39:12.390
The coroner had to surrender
the husband's body

39:12.425 --> 39:13.723
to a caravan

39:13.758 --> 39:15.293
of black
four-by-fours.

39:15.328 --> 39:16.793
Sent by whom?

39:18.496 --> 39:20.832
Whatever's happening here
is way above my pay grade.

39:20.867 --> 39:24.000
Someone,
someone powerful,

39:24.035 --> 39:28.673
finds Edward's family
very, very important.

39:30.408 --> 39:31.708
What?

39:31.743 --> 39:32.877
Too paranoid?

39:34.779 --> 39:36.647
Welcome to my world.

39:41.452 --> 39:42.719
For all we know,

39:42.754 --> 39:44.789
Robbie could be blaming himself
for his father's death.

39:44.824 --> 39:46.522
We've got to try and find him.

39:46.557 --> 39:48.426
He could be hiding
out of pure fear.

39:49.627 --> 39:51.362
You know,
I understand that.

39:54.766 --> 39:56.432
Magnus says you're, uh...

39:56.467 --> 39:58.569
going through with
the surgery.

39:58.604 --> 39:59.869
Yeah.

39:59.904 --> 40:01.239
Listen, if I start
growing man boobs,

40:01.274 --> 40:03.825
I'm depending on you
to tell me.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.377
Who knows,
you might look good.

40:09.747 --> 40:11.783
Hey, this belonged
to the boy, right?

40:11.818 --> 40:13.216
Robbie?

40:13.251 --> 40:16.254
Yeah, I guess so.
Why?

40:16.289 --> 40:18.122
Just wondering.

40:22.493 --> 40:25.596
Your mother should be here
in a couple of hours.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.296
What about Robbie?

40:27.331 --> 40:28.766
We're making every
effort to find him.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.935
Why were you
so afraid to tell us

40:30.970 --> 40:33.035
what, in the end,
you showed us?

40:33.070 --> 40:36.040
Mom always said
it would be the end of us all

40:36.075 --> 40:37.406
if the world
ever knew about him.

40:37.441 --> 40:39.811
Well, you don't
have to fear that now.

40:43.514 --> 40:45.348
Hello?

40:45.383 --> 40:46.651
Dr. Magnus, it's Henry.

40:46.686 --> 40:47.884
Where are you?

40:47.919 --> 40:49.687
I'm very close
to Robbie Meyers.

40:59.630 --> 41:01.130
Henry said

41:01.165 --> 41:04.168
Robbie's been living down here
all this time.

41:12.009 --> 41:13.075
Robbie!

41:13.110 --> 41:14.879
I told you he'd
be coming, didn't I?

41:18.349 --> 41:20.451
I've missed you so bad.

41:20.486 --> 41:22.485
It's okay.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.855
We can both go home now.

41:23.890 --> 41:26.958
Mom's waiting.

41:29.961 --> 41:31.028
Will...

41:55.853 --> 41:57.722
This is yours?

42:16.142 --> 42:17.441
Come in.

42:21.946 --> 42:23.514
You haven't forgotten
about today, have you?

42:24.715 --> 42:26.916
Oh, I didn't forget.

42:26.951 --> 42:28.119
I just kind of
changed my mind.

42:29.887 --> 42:32.189
You don't want to
go through with the operation?

42:33.758 --> 42:34.724
No.

42:34.759 --> 42:35.760
No, I don't.

42:36.894 --> 42:37.929
May I ask why?

42:39.530 --> 42:41.966
I'm not sure if there is
any one reason.

42:42.001 --> 42:44.902
I thought
about Edward, Robbie,

42:44.937 --> 42:46.535
what I might contribute

42:46.570 --> 42:47.805
if I gave the powers
a chance.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.109
I guess I thought about
some butterflies.

42:56.347 --> 42:58.516
Wow, I can't believe
I just said that.

42:58.551 --> 43:00.283
Neither can I.

43:00.318 --> 43:01.452
Doesn't sound like you.

43:02.787 --> 43:04.922
I guess you can say
I'm a changed man.
