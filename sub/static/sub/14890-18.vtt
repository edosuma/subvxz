(Balki)
Look at this, Ms. Lydia.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.854
I’m running for
Student Body President

01:27.888 --> 01:29.623
at the Chicago City College.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.158
Ah!
Balki, that’s terrific.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.459
‐Yeah.
‐How’s it going?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.629
Oh, just as sleazy as pie.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.499
Just like campaigning
on Mypos.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.267
All you have to do
is make sure

01:41.301 --> 01:42.803
that everyone knows
how you feel

01:42.836 --> 01:44.370
about the important issues.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.573
And I’ve already told
anyone who would listen

01:46.607 --> 01:49.109
that I’m pro‐sheep
and anti‐wolf.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.246
Coming out against wolves

01:53.279 --> 01:56.282
is a good start, Balki.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.351
But, uh, maybe you should ask
Larry to help you.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.352
Yeah.

01:59.385 --> 02:03.223
Um, actually I haven’t
told Cousin Larry

02:03.256 --> 02:05.191
that I’m, that I’m running.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.393
Oh, well, if you tell him,
I’m sure he’d help you

02:07.427 --> 02:09.461
with your campaign,
why don’t you ask him?

02:09.495 --> 02:13.466
[chuckles]
Well, because if I, uh

02:13.499 --> 02:15.669
if I ask Cousin Larry
to‐to help me

02:15.702 --> 02:18.872
with my campaign,
um, I’m sort of afraid

02:18.905 --> 02:21.742
Cousin Larry will
help me

02:21.775 --> 02:23.143
with my campaign.

02:25.712 --> 02:26.913
Uh, I don’t know
if you’ve noticed

02:26.947 --> 02:29.349
but Cousin Larry

02:29.382 --> 02:31.384
he‐he‐he’s trying
to be helpful

02:31.417 --> 02:33.520
but‐but he tends
to go overboard.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.156
He’s kind of
a type‐A personality.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.660
So, I‐I‐I beg of you

02:39.693 --> 02:42.428
please, promise me,
you won’t tell Cousin Larry?

02:42.462 --> 02:45.498
A team of wild horses
couldn’t drag it out of me.

Oh, I see you’re running

03:03.316 --> 03:04.851

03:07.020 --> 03:08.488
Oh, good luck
with your campaign‐‐

03:08.522 --> 03:10.824
Cousin, now, listen to me,
no matter what you say

03:10.857 --> 03:12.759
no matter what you do,
there is absolutely

03:12.793 --> 03:15.361
no way that I’m...

03:15.395 --> 03:17.698
What did you just say?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.333
I said, "Good luck
with your campaign."

03:20.366 --> 03:22.769
Well, bang my bongos
and call me Daisy.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.242
You mean to say that, that
you’re not gonna force yourself

03:29.275 --> 03:31.377
into my campaign and,
and then go overboard

03:31.411 --> 03:33.880
and make yourself
a royal pain in the boingi?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.784
Oh!

03:37.818 --> 03:39.820
Oh, I see.

03:39.853 --> 03:43.423
I see, you‐you think
because I lost

03:43.456 --> 03:46.259
every campaign
I managed in school

03:46.292 --> 03:48.795
that I would see your campaign
as my last chance

03:48.829 --> 03:50.764
to be a winner.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.801
You lost every single campaign?

03:56.537 --> 03:59.005
Yeah, yeah, uh...
No, no, I‐I admit it.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.642
Uh, it used to bother me,
but I’m over it.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.712
Those hundred and twenty hours
of self‐help tapes cured me.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.315
I no longer have that
overwhelming need

04:09.349 --> 04:11.384
to win just once.

So...good luck.

bulge out of your head

won’t start throbbing?

is covered in tapes

"Coping and being at peace

05:07.140 --> 05:09.510
Well, um, if I’m elected

05:09.543 --> 05:12.012
my goal is to reinstate
the language requirement.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.580
That means
every student have to

05:13.614 --> 05:15.448
take a foreign language
to graduate.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.684

You thought that I that I was
just gonna jump in and go crazy

05:55.822 --> 05:57.824
but‐but I was only asking,
if that’s your platform.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.760
And‐and if it is...

06:00.994 --> 06:02.395
...I hope it works for you.

I‐I don’t want you to think

06:44.137 --> 06:45.906
that I’m getting involved
in your campaign

06:45.939 --> 06:47.440
because I’m not.

a disinterested bystander

06:50.711 --> 06:54.615
uh, would you allow me to say
that spleen chip cookies

06:54.648 --> 06:56.983
are not gonna be enough
to, to get you elected.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.885

Don’t be ridiculous.

pouches and spleen chip cookies

07:17.971 --> 07:20.674
with or without pimentos,
may work on Mypos

not going to go overboard.

stuffing campaign literature

into envelopes.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.981
‐"Dear fellow student..."
‐No time now.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.249

what you said later.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.251

09:11.284 --> 09:14.755
how handsome you look
in the poster?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.824
Oh, cousin,
it’s a real Kojak moment.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.228
Now, over here,
we are tallying

09:22.262 --> 09:24.197
the latest results
of a poll we’ve just taken.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.033
I want to know how much
of a lead I have built for you.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.269
I’m good, Balki.
I am really good.

09:30.637 --> 09:31.872
Balki, this is so exciting.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.240
You’re gonna be
Student Body President!

09:34.274 --> 09:36.777
And I’m gonna be
First Girlfriend.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.844
I’ve recruited
Jennifer and Mary Anne

09:37.878 --> 09:39.079
to help with the women’s vote.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.380
Oh, I’m gonna speak
on your behalf

09:40.413 --> 09:41.982
at the women
in College Foundation.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.617
And I’m talking
to the cheerleaders.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.685
I speak their language.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.222
‐Give me a B!
‐B!

09:49.255 --> 09:51.091
‐Give me an A!
‐A!

09:51.124 --> 09:52.793
‐Give me an L!
‐L!

09:52.826 --> 09:54.327
‐Give me a K‐‐
‐Okay, Mary Anne, that’s good.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.196
That’s good. Save it, save it,
save it for the rally.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.203
Cousin, are all
of these people

10:03.236 --> 10:04.671
going to stay to dinner?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.908
Because I‐I only made
pig snout for four

10:07.941 --> 10:10.343
and you know how hard
it is to stretch snout.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.014
Balki, they’re not
staying for dinner.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.950
These are your campaign
working volunteers.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.053
They believe in you.
They love you.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.087
[chuckles]

10:25.859 --> 10:29.162
Now, your job
is just to be yourself.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.665
Just...be Balki.

10:31.698 --> 10:34.067
‐You think you can handle that?
‐Well, of course I can.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.368
Don’t be ridiculous.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.070
I’ve got the vest, the accent

10:37.103 --> 10:38.739
and twenty‐six years
of experience.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.407
I knew you could do it.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.243
Oh, cousin,
I’m gonna need your advice.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.812
You’ve got to tell me
which vest do you think

10:45.846 --> 10:47.914
I should wear to the debate.

10:47.948 --> 10:48.982
What debate?

10:49.015 --> 10:50.283
I’ve been challenged
to a debate

10:50.316 --> 10:52.886
the day before the election,
isn’t that great?

10:52.919 --> 10:55.922
No debate! No debate!
Debates are a big mistake.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.457
But, cousin, don’t you think
it’s a good way

10:57.490 --> 10:59.926
to show the students
how I feel about the issues?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.828
I’ve got that covered.
Don’t worry about it.

11:01.862 --> 11:02.929
Have I told you how good I am?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.097
‐Twice.
‐Okay.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.933
Now, tomorrow
at ten o’clock

11:06.967 --> 11:08.702
you’ll be meeting
with the football team.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.804
You’ll tell them how important
you think sports are

11:10.837 --> 11:11.905
to the school’s image,
got it?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.207
Uh, sports are good
for school’s image. Got it.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.009
Okay, then at 10:30, you’ll be
meeting with the science club.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.111
You’ll tell them, you think
education is important

11:18.144 --> 11:20.280
and too much of the school’s
budget is spent on sports.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.382
‐Got it?
‐Too much on sports. Got it.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.250
Okay, at noon, you’ll be
meeting with the fraternities.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.319
You’ll tell them, you think
entirely too much time

11:26.352 --> 11:27.387
is being spent in the classroom

11:27.420 --> 11:28.955
and you’re pushing
for a three day weekend, got it?

11:28.989 --> 11:29.823
Too much fraternity.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.124
Then at
three o’clock you’ll be

11:31.157 --> 11:32.258
meeting with
the Honor Society.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.494
You’ll tell them, you think,
we’re here to study

11:34.528 --> 11:36.897
not to party, and you’re pushing
for Saturday classes, got it?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.933
Okay, cousin,
small, small question

11:39.966 --> 11:42.903
from a simple Mypiot boy.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.172
This looks like I’m just telling
everyone what they want to hear.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.207
Welcome to politics.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.412
I am so proud of you.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.380
Now, cousin,
just hold on a moment.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.417
Are you asking me
to do something dishonest?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.019
B‐but, Balki,
you‐you want to

11:59.052 --> 12:00.253
reinstate the language
requirement, don’t you?

12:00.286 --> 12:02.455
‐Yes.
‐Well, to do that.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.190
You’re gonna have to get elected
Student Body President

12:04.224 --> 12:06.126
and I am the man
to help you do it.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.794
Cousin, I think
I can make my position

12:07.828 --> 12:10.030
on all the issues
clear at the debate.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.932
No debate!
Forget the debate!

12:11.965 --> 12:15.101
First rule of campaigning,
do not debate!

12:15.135 --> 12:18.539
Uh, Larry I have the results
of the latest poll.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.973
Attention!
Attention, everybody!

12:20.006 --> 12:21.508
We have the results
of the latest poll.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.510
Go ahead, Jennifer.
Give them the good news.

12:23.544 --> 12:24.444
‐Cousin, I‐‐
‐Uh, Larry, I think we should‐‐

12:24.477 --> 12:26.212
I think you’re wrong
about the debate.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.982
Balki, for the last time,
no debate! No debate!

12:29.015 --> 12:30.183
Go ahead, Jennifer.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.019
Tell them how far
Balki is ahead.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.188
Balki is trailing
by fifteen points.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.492
You’re gonna have to
debate your opponent.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.268
[instrumental music]

12:51.471 --> 12:53.807
[indistinct chatter]

12:53.840 --> 12:56.943
Balki, for the last time

12:56.977 --> 12:58.444
you are not going to wear

12:58.478 --> 13:02.215
the traditional
Myposian election hat!

13:02.248 --> 13:04.350
(Balki)
’Oh, is that so, is that?’

13:04.384 --> 13:05.519
‐Give it to me!
‐’No!’

13:05.552 --> 13:06.587
‐Give it to me!
‐’No!’

13:06.620 --> 13:08.288
Give it to me!

13:18.031 --> 13:20.967
[babbling]

13:22.035 --> 13:23.970
[panting]

13:25.271 --> 13:28.041
Jennifer, Mary Anne

13:28.074 --> 13:30.310
Balki is ready
for the mock debate.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.246
I’ve groomed him,
I’ve prepared him.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.615
It’s taken five years
off my life.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.584
[sobbing]

13:39.219 --> 13:41.454
Oh, ladies...

13:42.255 --> 13:44.057
...here he is

13:44.090 --> 13:46.593
the next
Student Body President

13:46.627 --> 13:48.595
of Chicago City College

13:48.629 --> 13:50.363
Balki Bartokomous.

13:50.396 --> 13:53.199
[applause]

13:58.204 --> 14:00.373
Oh, Balki, you look
so handsome in that suit.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.010
It needs a hat.

14:06.647 --> 14:08.582
It doesn’t need a hat.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.590
Okay, ladies,
take your seats.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.925
Now, Balki...

14:18.959 --> 14:21.227
[panting]

14:21.261 --> 14:24.164
Remember, ahem,
presentation is key...

14:24.197 --> 14:25.231
Right.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.099
...to winning the debate.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.234
Okay? Right, alright?
Okay? Alright?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.904
Well, what do we do
to improve our presentation?

14:30.937 --> 14:34.340
Um...
Oh! Oh!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.610
I don’t rest my hands
on the podium.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.679
It makes me look lazy.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.582
‐And, uh... Uh, and...
‐Uh, uh, uh, uh...

14:41.615 --> 14:44.117
Oh! And I don’t
fidget with my tie.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.987
It, uh, it makes me
look, uh, nervous.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.054
Uh‐huh.
What else?

14:49.322 --> 14:50.356
Heck if I know.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.126
[grunts]

14:53.159 --> 14:56.162
Oh! I never use the‐the phrase,
"Heck if I know."

14:56.196 --> 14:59.265
It makes me sound,
it makes me sound chloroformed.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.268
‐Uninformed.
‐Uninformed.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.437
‐Uninformed. Okay.
‐Yeah. Yeah.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.339
And...

15:06.372 --> 15:08.008
Ee...

15:13.614 --> 15:16.182
‐Oh! Uh, remember to smile.
‐Okay, good.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.150
‐Good, good. Alright.
‐Okay.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.452
Here we go. Here we go.
Alright, go ahead.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.455
Jennifer, ask
the first question.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.489
[clearing throat]

15:29.195 --> 15:31.097
‐Mr. Bartokomous...
‐Uh‐huh?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.969
What is your position
on the financing

15:36.002 --> 15:37.337
of student loans?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.174
Student loans?

15:43.309 --> 15:45.278
Boy, I wish I had a hat.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.580
‐Balki!
‐Okay, okay, okay.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.281
‐Okay, okay.
‐’Ask the question again.’

15:49.683 --> 15:52.385
Mr. Bartokomous,
what is your position

15:52.418 --> 15:55.055
on the financing
of student loans?

15:55.088 --> 15:59.192
Jennifer, uh, uh, I’m glad
you asked me that question

15:59.225 --> 16:02.195
because the financing
of student loans

16:02.228 --> 16:05.999
um, is‐is an issue
that deserves my attention

16:06.032 --> 16:08.434
and, uh, and, uh,
let me assure you

16:08.468 --> 16:12.105
that my attention
is what it will receive

16:12.138 --> 16:15.441
in‐in its complete
and unabridged form.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.211
Uh, and‐and the financing
of student loans

16:18.244 --> 16:21.447
is actually part of,
uh, of my...

16:21.481 --> 16:24.250
...ten point program
for better schooling.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.019
Yes, Balki,
you are doing great!

16:26.052 --> 16:27.621
‐Oh!
‐Ah! Ah!

16:27.654 --> 16:29.222
Smile.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.693
[instrumental music]

16:39.332 --> 16:41.401
Larry, I have to talk to you,
I have something to tell you

16:41.434 --> 16:42.803
that’s going to upset you.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.304
You’ve changed your mind.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.406
You‐you’re not gonna marry me?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.775
That’s awful!
You didn’t tell me that!

16:50.811 --> 16:53.113
That’s not the bad news.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.381
Well, maybe not to you,
but think of poor Larry.

16:57.483 --> 16:58.752
Larry, the bad...

17:00.253 --> 17:01.822
Larry, it’s not
about the marriage.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.790
Oh!

17:03.824 --> 17:06.492
Thank God.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.261
The bad news is
the athletes found out

17:08.294 --> 17:10.463
about Balki’s plan to reinstate
the language requirement.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.398
They’ve switched their votes
to Balki’s opponent.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.701
Alright, I thought
this might happen

17:14.734 --> 17:15.801
I gotta tell Balki.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.442
Come on, Mary Anne,
we better take our seats.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.444
You know, it’s a good thing
Larry has this campaign

17:24.477 --> 17:26.780
to take his mind
off the broken engagement.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.651
Balki?

17:30.684 --> 17:32.385
The athletes have decided
to change their votes

17:32.418 --> 17:34.220
to your opponent.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.322
Well, people change
their minds.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.291
Pigs, on the other hand,
make one decision

17:38.324 --> 17:40.694
and stick with it.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.328
[snorts]

17:42.362 --> 17:43.396
Balki, don’t you understand?

17:43.429 --> 17:45.732
If we don’t get them
to change their votes back

17:45.766 --> 17:47.701
we’re going to
lose the election.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.136
Now I have an easy fix,
all we have to do is

17:50.170 --> 17:51.738
lose the language thing
and they’ll switch back to us.

17:51.772 --> 17:54.140
Cousin, wait a minute.
Are you...

17:54.174 --> 17:56.176
You know sometimes,
I think

17:56.209 --> 17:58.478
you’re just a few grapes
shy of a bunch.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.313
Have you been listening?

18:00.346 --> 18:01.748
I cannot lose
the language thing.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.684
That’s the reason
I’m running for president.

18:03.717 --> 18:05.752
I cannot give that up.

18:05.786 --> 18:07.854
Balki, your goal
is to get elected.

18:07.888 --> 18:09.523
Tell them what
they want to hear.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.857
Once you’re elected,
you can do whatever you want.

18:10.891 --> 18:13.126
Cousin, isn’t that
just a bit dishonest?

18:13.159 --> 18:14.360
It’s the American way.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.632
But won’t
the students mind?

18:18.665 --> 18:20.734
Mind?
They expect it!

18:20.767 --> 18:21.835
Wait a minute...

18:21.868 --> 18:23.269
Uh, preceding the debate

18:23.303 --> 18:24.470
there will be
an opening statement

18:24.505 --> 18:27.140
and a short period
of questions and answers

18:27.173 --> 18:28.875
by each candidate.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.812
Uh, Mr. Bartokomous, we’re ready
for your opening statement.

18:46.693 --> 18:51.431
Uh, thank you,
my fair chair lady

18:51.464 --> 18:54.801
faculty and my worthy opponent

18:54.835 --> 18:55.836
and students.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.806
My name is Balki Bartokomous

18:59.840 --> 19:02.442
of the students,
for the students

19:02.475 --> 19:03.710
by the students.

19:03.744 --> 19:05.512
Ah! Ah!

19:05.546 --> 19:06.547
Ee...

19:11.618 --> 19:13.854
Uh, if elected, I promise

19:13.887 --> 19:17.257
to be firm, yet flexible

19:17.290 --> 19:19.893
tough, yet vulnerable

19:19.926 --> 19:22.262
soft, yet absorbent.

19:29.435 --> 19:33.840
I would like to establish
a kinder, gentler cafeteria.

19:33.874 --> 19:36.810
[applause]

19:38.244 --> 19:39.613
We will now open the floor

19:39.646 --> 19:41.414
to questions
for Mr. Bartokomous.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.353
Uh, yes, in the pink angora.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.488
My name is Lisa Morgan.
Mr. Bar‐‐

19:48.522 --> 19:50.323
Hi, Lisa!

19:50.356 --> 19:51.725
Hi.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.826
Mr. Bartokomous

19:52.859 --> 19:55.495
when you spoke in front
of the Honor’s Society

19:55.529 --> 19:58.464
you said you wanted to be
the Education President.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.901
But when you spoke
in front of the fraternities

20:00.934 --> 20:03.537
you said education
was overrated.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.705
Where do you stand?

20:04.738 --> 20:06.807
I’m glad you,
you asked that question

20:06.840 --> 20:09.776
because where I stand

20:09.810 --> 20:12.679
uh, deserves my attention.

20:12.713 --> 20:16.349
And I can assure you
that where I stand

20:16.382 --> 20:17.818
’will receive my attention’

20:17.851 --> 20:20.486
in its complete
and unabridged form.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.456
‐Good answer.
‐Um, wait a minute.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.725
That doesn’t seem
to make any sense to‐‐

20:24.758 --> 20:27.327
‐Next question!
‐Hey, I got a question!

20:27.360 --> 20:28.829
What about the rumor
that you want us to take

20:28.862 --> 20:30.831
some dumb language
before we graduate?

20:32.365 --> 20:33.433
I’m glad you asked
that question

20:33.466 --> 20:35.669
because I cannot lie to you.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.303
‐Now, let me just‐‐
‐Uh, uh, yes. Uh...

20:37.337 --> 20:40.006
Uh, Mr. Bartokomous cannot lie
and he cannot stay.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.307
He has another engagement.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.375
Which is why
I’m here to tell you

20:42.408 --> 20:43.710
that, uh, if elected...

20:43.744 --> 20:44.945
Cousin, please.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.713
Please, I have to do this.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.354
Listen, if you’re
going to vote for me

20:54.387 --> 20:55.556
you’ve got to know who I am

20:55.589 --> 20:57.490
and what I really believe in.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.560
My name is Balki Bartokomous

20:59.593 --> 21:02.462
and I’m a sheepherder
from Mypos.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.765
And yes, if I am elected
I do intend

21:04.798 --> 21:06.733
to reinstate
the language requirement.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.703
[booing]

21:12.038 --> 21:14.775
[instrumental music]

21:24.918 --> 21:26.587
I lost, Balki.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.390
I lost big.

21:31.925 --> 21:35.529
You know, I wanted
to win just once.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.430
Cousin, would you
please stop this?

21:37.463 --> 21:38.565
You did not lose.

21:38.599 --> 21:41.434
I lost. I lost. I did.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.036
I lost the election.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.773
You’re right, Balki.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.544
You’re the big loser.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.416
And don’t you forget it.

22:00.954 --> 22:03.790
I‐I can’t believe
you’re taking this so well.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.858
You lost.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.793
But, cousin,
I did not lose.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.562
I‐I didn’t get
elected president

22:08.595 --> 22:09.896
but I got what I wanted.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.397
My opponent thought

22:11.431 --> 22:12.999
that reinstating
the language requirement

22:13.033 --> 22:14.935
was a good idea
and she’s gonna push for it.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.671
And that makes you happy?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.039
Happy?

22:19.072 --> 22:20.874
I’m erratic!

22:25.478 --> 22:27.080
‐Oh, God!
‐Oh, goodness!

22:27.113 --> 22:29.516
‐I lost again!
‐Oh, no.

22:29.550 --> 22:31.752
I’ve lost thirteen
student elections

22:31.785 --> 22:33.854
and the last one
I wasn’t even a student!

22:33.887 --> 22:35.556
‐Okay.
‐Oh, God.

22:35.589 --> 22:37.658
Okay, here we go,
tape number one.

22:37.691 --> 22:39.660
I can’t belie...

22:39.693 --> 22:42.362
"My body is a hollow reed.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.667
Trouble blows through me
like the wind."

22:47.934 --> 22:49.069
[whistles]

22:50.070 --> 22:53.006
[instrumental music]

22:57.778 --> 23:00.146
[theme music]

23:16.763 --> 23:17.764
[music continues]
