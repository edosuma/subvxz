00:16.767 --> 00:20.604
Okay. So the presence of ice on Mars
suggests water,

00:20.687 --> 00:23.232
either now or sometime in the past.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.237
Yes. It's very exciting.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.408
And on Europa, the presence of an ocean
below the ice is also promising

00:33.492 --> 00:37.704
because it means that conditions could
be right for life to develop there too.

00:39.498 --> 00:44.294
Exactly. And there's potentially
been enough time for life to evolve.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.715
That means Europa's definitely a place
for NASA to keep researching.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.225
Not so fast, Snoopy.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.770
We haven't found life yet.
Just the potential for life.
We haven't found life yet.
Just the potential for life.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.438
It's big, but it's not "root beer" big.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.443
Hey!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.489
<i>Marcie and Franklin are right.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:17.661
<i>But hopefully, we will discover something
that's "root beer" big very soon.</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:19.204
<i>I'll check back later.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:25.794
So, where should we look next?

01:25.878 --> 01:29.423
What about this planet?
It's about the same size as Earth.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.679
And the same roundness as your head.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.267
That's Venus, Charles.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.020
Named for the Roman goddess of love.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.105
Goddess of love?

01:45.189 --> 01:49.651
That sounds like the perfect place.
Doesn't it, my Sweet Babboo?

01:50.569 --> 01:51.945
I'm not your Sweet Babboo.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.657
It's funny that it's named
after the goddess of love

01:55.741 --> 01:59.578
because Venus is actually
a very harsh and unpleasant place.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.289
Sounds like love to me.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.878
Valentine's Day! A chance for people
to show you how much they care.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.841
I got something this year.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.598
I can't stand it.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.021
It's still the best valentine I ever got.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.147
Sorry, Charles.

02:27.231 --> 02:31.485
But according to my research, finding life
on Venus would be very unlikely.

02:34.029 --> 02:38.075
I still think we should consider it.
I've never been one to give up.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
Ow!

02:40.369 --> 02:42.412
Despite all evidence that you should.

02:45.249 --> 02:49.086
Marcie's right.
I guess it was a pretty silly idea.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.271
Venus does seem
like an unlikely place for life.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.355
For one thing,

03:08.438 --> 03:12.442
it's got the thickest atmosphere of all
the rocky planets in the solar system.

03:33.046 --> 03:37.718
The thick atmosphere traps the sun's heat.
So Venus is incredibly hot.

03:37.801 --> 03:42.389
Day-at-the-beach hot,
or fresh-out-of-the-oven-apple-pie hot?

03:42.472 --> 03:46.894
Much hotter. Around 462 degrees Celsius.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.606
That's over 860 degrees Fahrenheit.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.777
What? I know stuff.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.323
<i>Venus is also exceptionally dry.</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:10.542
<i>And don't forget the wind.
It's stronger than a tornado.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:16.130
It sure doesn't sound like
the kind of place we'd find life.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.301
It's not. Even the air is poisonous.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.222
Although, there is evidence that
there are underground caves on Venus.

04:23.305 --> 04:27.518
I suppose it's possible
life could exist down there.

05:09.935 --> 05:15.023
Of course, those caves were made by
volcanoes. So they might be full of lava.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.347
- Well, scratch Venus off the list.
- Agreed.

05:47.431 --> 05:51.101
It doesn't seem like the kind of place
that could support life as we know it.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.229
Well, what about life as we don't know it?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.316
Don't be a blockhead, Charlie Brown.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.777
<i>Actually,
Charlie Brown makes a good point.</i>
<i>Actually,
Charlie Brown makes a good point.</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.071
- He does?
- I do?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.406
<i>You bet.</i>

06:04.489 --> 06:07.409
<i>Part of the search for life
is considering the possibility</i>

06:07.492 --> 06:11.079
<i>that life may exist in ways
we don't fully comprehend yet.</i>

06:11.163 --> 06:15.501
<i>Why, even here on Earth there are
examples of life we barely understand.</i>

06:16.168 --> 06:19.588
<i>From microscopic organisms
living in superheated vents</i>

06:19.671 --> 06:21.215
<i>at the bottom of the ocean</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:25.052
<i>to bacteria that somehow survive
in volcanic acid lakes.</i>

06:25.719 --> 06:30.641
<i>Earth is full of life that lives
in extreme and unusual environments.</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:35.187
So it's possible life
might exist on Venus after all?

06:35.270 --> 06:37.189
<i>You never know, Charlie Brown.</i>

06:37.272 --> 06:41.568
<i>There could even be tiny life forms
living in Venus's atmosphere.</i>

06:43.987 --> 06:45.447
<i>Imagine that.</i>

06:45.531 --> 06:49.618
<i>Life floating above it all,
surviving against the odds.</i>

07:04.758 --> 07:08.011
Life as we don't know it?
Who would've thought?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.430
Charlie Brown. That's who.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.852
<i>Good ol' Charlie Brown.</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:21.483
Way to go, big brother!

07:23.735 --> 07:25.821
Thanks, Snoopy. To life!

07:38.917 --> 07:40.836
There goes the solar system.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.840
Good grief.
