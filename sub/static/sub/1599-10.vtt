00:00.001 --> 00:02.935
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> glee...

00:02.937 --> 00:05.938
Consider this the opening salvo
of world war sue.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.141
I'm asking you for your help
to destroy the glee club.

00:09.143 --> 00:12.144
I will not stop
until your little glee club

00:12.146 --> 00:15.147
Is anhiliated into oblivion.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.150
I swear to sweet holy satan
i will end you.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.952
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on glee.</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:22.287
All right, let's see what
you guys have been working on.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.791
(clean bandit's "rather be"
begins)

00:25.793 --> 00:28.027
¶ oh ¶

00:28.029 --> 00:31.030
¶ oh, whoa ¶

00:31.032 --> 00:34.033
¶ oh, yeah ¶

00:34.035 --> 00:38.537
¶ we're a thousand miles
from comfort ¶

00:38.539 --> 00:41.874
¶ we have traveled
land and sea ¶

00:41.876 --> 00:46.178
¶ but as long
as you are with me ¶

00:46.180 --> 00:50.749
¶ there's no place

00:50.751 --> 00:54.420
¶ i will wait forever ¶

01:06.767 --> 01:08.867
¶ with every step i take ¶

01:08.869 --> 01:12.838
¶ kyoto to the bay,
strolling so casually ¶

01:12.840 --> 01:14.440
¶<i> bum-bum-bum-bum-bum</i> ¶

01:14.442 --> 01:16.742
¶ we're different and the same ¶

01:16.744 --> 01:18.744
¶ gave you another name ¶

01:18.746 --> 01:22.581
¶ switch up the batteries ¶

01:22.583 --> 01:26.518

i would take it ¶

01:26.520 --> 01:30.289

02:12.633 --> 02:14.399
¶<i> no place i'd rather be</i> ¶

02:20.107 --> 02:23.475
¶ there's no place

02:23.477 --> 02:26.178
All right!
Great job, guys.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.346
That was really impressive.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.114
Thank you so much.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.016
Okay, now i know you guys
probably still have

02:31.018 --> 02:33.652
Vacation brain, but any pointers
would really help us out.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.321
Guys, thoughts?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.290
What is going on with you, guys?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.758
There was a fire at dalton.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.627
It burned to
the ground.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.463
There's nothing left.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.998
Academy's gone.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.103
(school bell ringing)

02:51.105 --> 02:52.938
Thank you, everyone, for coming

02:52.940 --> 02:55.207
To this emergency
glee club meeting.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.377
Now, as i'm sure everyone
in this room is aware of by now,

02:58.379 --> 03:01.180
Dalton academy has burned
to the ground.

03:01.182 --> 03:05.150
Now, i've gathered you all
here today because blaine, kurt

03:05.152 --> 03:07.152
And myself have
been talking and...

03:07.154 --> 03:09.321
Although just a moment ago,
we could only see

03:09.323 --> 03:11.690
The warblers as our competition,

03:11.692 --> 03:15.194
Now it's time for us to see them
as a friend and ally.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.162
We have made the decision
to make some lemonade

03:17.164 --> 03:19.164
Out of these lemons

03:19.166 --> 03:22.534
And join together
as a show choir super group.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.303
This is an opportunity
for all of us.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.338
We need them just as much
as they need us.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.172
Where's rachel?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.208
Shouldn't she be here for this?

03:29.210 --> 03:30.709
Uh, she is in new york
on some business,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.211
But she'll be back soon.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.845
But she is totally on board
with this plan.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.214
Well, okay.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.317
(cheering)

03:42.489 --> 03:44.990
Thank you so much, mr.
Schuester, for your generosity.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.425
It is in times
like these that

03:46.427 --> 03:48.860
We can find comfort in the
kindness of our friends.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.263
It's gonna be a challenge
for all of us to move forward,

03:51.265 --> 03:52.831
But i know that we can do this.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.734
And i think it's so awesome
that the warblers' passion

03:55.736 --> 03:57.736
For show choir is
stronger than ever,

03:57.738 --> 03:59.371
'cause we're really
gonna need that strength

03:59.373 --> 04:02.407
And commitment to not only
win sectionals,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.910
But to take it all the way
to nationals this year!

04:04.912 --> 04:06.311
Come on, guys!
(cheering)

04:08.716 --> 04:09.948
(whoops)
yeah!

04:09.950 --> 04:12.351
I'm sorry,

04:12.353 --> 04:14.253
But the aroma of overly
dry-cleaned polyester uniforms

04:14.255 --> 04:16.255
Just wafted into my office

04:16.257 --> 04:19.358
And up my extremely
sensitive nose.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.926
And i can see why now.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.895
The glee club is hosting
the lima gay men's chorus.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.698
Oh, no, she didn't!
Blaine: Sue...

04:26.700 --> 04:27.866
You know very well that
these are the warblers.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.368
They're at mckinley now.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.302
They're part
of the new directions!

04:30.304 --> 04:32.437
Oh, they most certainly are not.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.073
And they're going to take their
freshly scrubbed cherubic faces

04:35.075 --> 04:37.643
And get the hell
out of my school.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.910
They're staying, sue.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.412
I've already cleared it
with the superintendent.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.315
How dare you go
over my head!

04:43.317 --> 04:46.118
Well, i will just have
to get it un-cleared

04:46.120 --> 04:48.920
With senate majority
leader mitch mcconnell,

04:48.922 --> 04:51.657
Who i met recently
on the cayman islands

04:51.659 --> 04:54.393
At a leadership retreat
and turtle hunt.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.428
He's also a
priority contact

04:56.430 --> 04:58.830
On my brand-new
cutting-edge apple watch.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.468
Now, fly away, warblers.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.304
Don't listen to her. Stay.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.471
Leave!
Stay!

05:06.473 --> 05:08.807
There's a good chance
we won't be rehearsing today.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.075
Make no mistake, william.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.077
When the final bell tolls,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.278
I will have plucked

05:13.280 --> 05:15.514
Every warbler feather
out of this school.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.850
Doomsday has arrived.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.619
Bring it, suzy q.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.254
Don't call me that.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.655
Suzy q.
Stop it.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.690
Suzy q.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.258
What's the q stand for?

05:26.260 --> 05:28.660
You monster, coach!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.329
Why wouldn't you let
the warblers

05:30.331 --> 05:33.298
Join the new directions!?
It's so unfair!

05:33.300 --> 05:36.468
Honey, becky, i cannot
understand a word you're saying.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.271
I think she's saying it's unfair
that you won't let the warblers

05:39.273 --> 05:41.273
Join the glee club?
For crying out loud.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.375
The superintendent
said it was okay!

05:43.377 --> 05:45.711
And "the superintendent
said it was okay."

05:45.713 --> 05:48.213
Well, the superintendent
may have said it was okay,

05:48.215 --> 05:51.149
But the president pro tem
of the united states senate,

05:51.151 --> 05:53.485
Orrin g. Hatch,
begs to differ.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.854
Oh, save the drama
for your mama!

05:55.856 --> 05:58.023
The utah republican
agrees with me

05:58.025 --> 05:59.691
That the glee club
is stupid

05:59.693 --> 06:02.160
And that the notion that
two rival show choirs

06:02.162 --> 06:04.229
Would suddenly just join
forces out of nowhere

06:04.231 --> 06:07.733
Is both morally repugnant
and convenient.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.534
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.702
Becky jackson,

06:10.704 --> 06:13.472
Do not stand in my way,

06:13.474 --> 06:14.906
Lest i brand you a traitor.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.744
I've performed unspeakable acts
of loyalty for you.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.580
She said she's performed
unspeakable acts of loyalty.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.482
Really? Like what?

06:23.484 --> 06:26.418
Becky:
<i>I shoplifted for you!</i>

06:26.420 --> 06:28.687
<i>I perjured myself</i>
<i>before a grand jury.</i>

06:28.689 --> 06:30.889
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing

06:30.891 --> 06:33.258
But the truth so help you god?
I swear.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.426
I don't even know why,

06:34.428 --> 06:37.028
But hurting kids
with a burned-down school

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
Is my moral limit!

06:38.532 --> 06:40.999
You're evil, sue sylvester!

06:41.001 --> 06:43.001
And you're not
my friend anymore.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.437
Becky jackson, don't you
trundle away from me.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.205
You toddle out of this office,

06:47.207 --> 06:49.274
And you will never come back!
(becky crying)

06:50.544 --> 06:53.078
You.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.080
You did this.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.082
You turned her
against me.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.451
No, she turned on you
all by herself.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.620
Okay.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.927
Rachel:<i> It's hard to believe</i>
<i>it's only been a year</i>

07:08.929 --> 07:11.363
<i>Since i walked the halls</i>
<i>of nyada, but i feel like</i>

07:11.365 --> 07:12.531
<i>A completely different person.</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:14.065
<i>I used to be just like them--</i>

07:14.067 --> 07:16.067
<i>Naive and eager--</i>
<i>and i used to see this place</i>

07:16.069 --> 07:18.570
<i>As just another stepping stone</i>
<i>on the way to bigger things.</i>

07:18.572 --> 07:20.572
<i>But i'm not that girl anymore.</i>

07:20.574 --> 07:22.441
<i>I've been through the fire</i>
<i>and clawed my way back,</i>

07:22.443 --> 07:24.443
<i>And now i'm here to ask</i>
<i>for a second chance</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:25.877
<i>From the one woman</i>
<i>who can do it.</i>

07:25.879 --> 07:28.079
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>She might laugh in my face,</i>

07:28.081 --> 07:30.248
<i>And i don't even care, 'cause</i>
<i>i know one thing for sure.</i>

07:30.250 --> 07:31.917
I can do this.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.286
Rachel berry?
Mm-hmm.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.788
Madame tibideaux is ready
to see you now, briefly.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.823
Okay.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.124
But i wouldn't
get my hopes up.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.560
She's been looking
forward to this.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.466
(phone rings)

07:48.435 --> 07:50.635
You can go in now.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.542
Thank you.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.816
Butt chin?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.518
I... Mean, william.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.686
What are you
doing here?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.921
What a wonderful surprise.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.491
I'm just as surprised
as you are, sue.

08:12.493 --> 08:13.492
Harris:
Actually,

08:13.494 --> 08:16.328
Principal sylvester, i...

08:16.330 --> 08:17.662
Hope you'll, uh...

08:17.664 --> 08:20.665
Take the formality
of this meeting seriously.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.667
I need to make sure
you understand

08:22.669 --> 08:24.369
What i am telling you today.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.871
And mr. Schuester
is a witness,

08:25.873 --> 08:27.672
As well as an aggrieved party.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.476
Well, i'm happy to
clear up any confusion.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.178
Something has come
to my attention,

08:33.180 --> 08:35.614
Something grave and...

08:35.616 --> 08:38.116
Almost beyond...

08:39.453 --> 08:42.220
I saw your hurt locker, sue.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.465
I can't believe my eyes.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.234
Sue sylvester keeps
the keys to this place?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.970
Now, in executive coaching,
they train us to be

08:58.972 --> 09:01.139
Ready for the most
extreme circumstances.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.643
But what i saw next
chilled me to my marrow.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.549
Myron?

09:10.551 --> 09:13.552
My own nephew?

09:13.554 --> 09:16.688
He's just an innocent bystander,

09:16.690 --> 09:20.358
A tween genius who...
Loves sequins too much.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.626
(bell gongs)

09:25.732 --> 09:28.400
What?

09:28.402 --> 09:32.170
I am all for young love,
but, uh...

09:32.172 --> 09:34.773
But this is wrong, right?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.841
I could've overlooked,

09:36.843 --> 09:38.243
Oh, so many things,

09:38.245 --> 09:41.646
But what i saw next
left me no other choice.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.649
What's this?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.690
(gasps)

09:51.692 --> 09:53.592
Sweet...

09:53.594 --> 09:55.493
Sue sylvester?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.464
I don't see how my...

09:59.466 --> 10:02.200
Personal forms of
recreation, uh,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.769
Have negatively impacted
my job performance.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.939
I inspire people
by stoking my own

10:07.941 --> 10:09.774
Embers, if you will.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.043
And i stand by,
and am very proud,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.613
Of what good i have
done for this school.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.649
And if i think if you were
to ask any mckinley parent

10:17.651 --> 10:18.950
Or student or any reader

10:18.952 --> 10:21.553
Of the<i> u.S. News</i>
<i>and world report...</i>

10:21.555 --> 10:24.589
I take my responsibilities
seriously, principal sylvester.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.558
And clearly...

10:26.560 --> 10:29.060
A part of you does as well.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.562
(clears throat)
but after i saw

10:30.564 --> 10:33.298
Your locker of vendetta
and your...

10:33.300 --> 10:35.300
Pornographic spread,

10:35.302 --> 10:36.901
I cannot

10:36.903 --> 10:39.838
Allow you near
the students of mckinley.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.807
Or... Any other young people,

10:42.809 --> 10:44.609
Anywhere, ever.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.746
It is with profound regret

10:47.748 --> 10:49.514
That i terminate
your employment.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.485
I'm sorry, wha...?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.287
I'm sorry, what
did... You say?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.490
You're fired.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.864
Hello, america,
i'm geraldo rivera.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.967
Washington, jefferson,
madison, sylvester.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.636
<i>My guest tonight</i>
<i>is an american treasure--</i>

11:11.638 --> 11:13.004
<i>Or at least, she was.</i>

11:13.006 --> 11:14.606
<i>Champion cheerleading coach</i>

11:14.608 --> 11:17.475
Sue sylvester has led a life
chock-full of winning.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.644
Lately, sue,
it seems like

11:19.646 --> 11:21.646
You've been smacked around
by the loser stick.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.647
Is that right?

11:22.649 --> 11:25.350
Well, geraldo, uh,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.986
Despite being one of the scions
of american education,

11:27.988 --> 11:30.555
I have recently
lost my position,

11:30.557 --> 11:32.524
My financial security

11:32.526 --> 11:35.627
And my legacy
has been tarnished.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.696
And today, i intend
to set the record straight.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.064
But, sue,
reading your record

11:39.066 --> 11:40.465
Of accomplishments,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.567
They seem almost
too good to be true.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.803
And when our fact-checkers
pored through them, sue,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.838
They found out that
most of them are made up.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.373
I beg your pardon?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.741
Well, for instance, we learned

11:49.743 --> 11:52.343
That you were not born
in the panama canal zone,

11:52.345 --> 11:54.412
You did not fight
in the falklands war,

11:54.414 --> 11:58.817
You did not play any role in
extracting the dictator noriega,

11:58.819 --> 12:01.152
Nor is there any evidence
whatsoever

12:01.154 --> 12:02.687
That you were ever waterboarded.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.090
Now, geraldo, i'm gonna
stop you right there.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.725
I waterboarded myself.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.027
You did not direct the tv movie

12:09.029 --> 12:10.995
<i>The dallas cowboys</i>
<i>cheerleaders,</i>

12:10.997 --> 12:13.732
You don't have
trinidadian roots,

12:13.734 --> 12:16.534
Nor were you ever,
even for the shortest time,

12:16.536 --> 12:18.403
The tambourine player
for wilson phillips.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.172
I played tambourine
for wilson phillips.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.341
Geraldo, i-i'd
like to respond

12:23.343 --> 12:24.576
To some of these
allegations.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.111
You've claimed to have

12:26.113 --> 12:27.946
Romantic involvements
with dan quayle,

12:27.948 --> 12:29.914
Stephen baldwin, matt lauer,

12:29.916 --> 12:31.850
Johnny cochran, david boreanaz

12:31.852 --> 12:34.853
And the drummer
from jimmy eat world.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.621
All of these men have
categorically denied this.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.557
I dated all of the members
of jimmy eat world.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.794
It just begs the question, sue:
Are you a compulsive liar?

12:42.796 --> 12:45.730
I mean, you've publically
and repeatedly claimed,

12:45.732 --> 12:47.699
For example,
that the singer michael bolton

12:47.701 --> 12:48.967
Is the father of your child.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.769
Well, that is absolutely true.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.705
Sue sylvester, our producers
have found out otherwise.

12:53.707 --> 12:54.706
Take a look.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.875
I've never met sue sylvester

12:56.877 --> 12:59.077
Or heard of this
"thunderbolton69."

12:59.079 --> 13:00.979
I only heard about her
when my lawyers

13:00.981 --> 13:02.447
Informed me that she had been

13:02.449 --> 13:05.049
Going around saying
i had bought her an island

13:05.051 --> 13:07.152
Where we had a years-long
torrid affair,

13:07.154 --> 13:09.120
And that i was
the father of her child.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.488
I honestly think the woman has

13:10.490 --> 13:12.157
Some sort of mental illness.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.925
Sue, do you want
to respond to this?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.126
Fine.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.428
I will admit i can't prove

13:17.430 --> 13:19.264
That michael bolton
is the father of my child.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.901
Let's hear from another
of sue's alleged lovers

13:22.903 --> 13:24.602
To find out what he has to say.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.605
Look, i don't blame sue for
falling head over heels for me.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.807
I mean, she's got eyes.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.576
But she mistook a little
grab-ass in a condo

13:31.578 --> 13:32.911
For true love.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.779
That bitch is crazy.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.780
She had me kidnapped!

13:35.782 --> 13:37.782
And then she signed me up

13:37.784 --> 13:39.250
For these dating sites:

13:39.252 --> 13:42.320
Farmers only,
blackpeoplemeet.Com.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.523
And the only thing
that she put in my profile

13:45.525 --> 13:47.859
Was that my boobs were like
elephant ears.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.761
Sue, it just
makes me wonder:

13:49.763 --> 13:51.162
Are you okay?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.097
Do you have a history
of profound mental illness?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.101
What i have a
history of, geraldo,

13:57.103 --> 13:58.803
Is devoting my entire life

13:58.805 --> 14:00.772
To the students
of mckinley high.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.507
You know, when i graduated
from the sorbonne,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.275
I was recruited

14:04.277 --> 14:07.512
By every single one of wall
street's top investment banks.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.114
Halliburton wanted
me for their coo.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.351
One time, a very drunk
boris yeltsin called to tell me

14:13.353 --> 14:15.854
That if i wanted russia,
he would just give it to me.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.689
I could've had wealth

14:17.691 --> 14:19.991
And power beyond
my wildest dreams!

14:19.993 --> 14:21.793
But instead, i chose a career

14:21.795 --> 14:23.661
Filled with service
and sacrifice

14:23.663 --> 14:26.064
In order to nurture and
enrich the delicate minds

14:26.066 --> 14:28.132
Of america's children.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.336
Since day one, they have been
and will continue to be

14:31.338 --> 14:32.971
My number one priority.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.073
Sue, a lot of these things
that you have just mentioned

14:35.075 --> 14:36.241
Seem like lies to me.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.077
I visited mckinley
high school to talk

14:39.079 --> 14:40.411
To some of these students,

14:40.413 --> 14:41.946
And they tell
a much different story.

14:42.749 --> 14:43.815
She slashed the tires

14:43.817 --> 14:46.251
On my wheelchair 17 times.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.153
She swapped out my weave glue
with mayonnaise.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.023
She made a fake elevator
which she trapped us in

14:52.025 --> 14:54.325
And then pumped airborne
drugs through the vents

14:54.327 --> 14:56.861
And built a small robot
that forced us to kiss

14:56.863 --> 14:58.663
While it watched
and made noises.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.232
She put a live bear
in my house.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.034
Sue sylvester came
all the way to new york city

15:03.036 --> 15:05.570
To see me in my opening night
on broadway--<i> funny girl--</i>

15:05.572 --> 15:07.505
Just so that she could
walk out halfway through

15:07.507 --> 15:09.607
And have sex
all over my apartment.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.042
She cut my dreads off.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.410
Geraldo: Why does she hate
the glee club so much?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.945
Do you have any explanation?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.047
She's had it out
for the glee club

15:16.049 --> 15:17.548
From the very beginning.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.950
Before we were around,

15:18.952 --> 15:19.951
The cheerios! Were the stars
of this school,

15:19.953 --> 15:21.586
And then we showed up,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.922
And she's never forgiven us
for stealing her thunder.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.924
Geraldo rivera,
this is an outrage!

15:25.926 --> 15:28.326
This is slander!

15:28.327 --> 15:30.727
These are all lies orchestrated
by one will schuester!

15:30.730 --> 15:31.896
Judas!

15:31.898 --> 15:33.898
This may come as
a surprise to you, sue,

15:33.900 --> 15:36.968
But it was not will schuester
who tipped us off.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.736
It was someone else.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.371
It was becky jackson.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.041
Becky:
<i>Who is becky jackson?</i>

15:43.043 --> 15:44.809
<i>America's dying to know.</i>

15:44.811 --> 15:47.145
<i>Well, i could tell you</i>
<i>who she is.</i>

15:47.147 --> 15:51.082
<i>She's a poet, a lover</i>
<i>and a dreamer.</i>

15:51.084 --> 15:54.552
<i>I know, because</i>
<i>becky jackson is me.</i>

15:54.554 --> 15:56.788
Becky always told me stories
about coach sylvester,

15:56.790 --> 15:59.991
But that's what i thought
they were: Just stories.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.927
I was like, wait, her
secretary's an actual convict?

16:02.929 --> 16:05.563
She pushes kids down the stairs?

16:05.565 --> 16:06.931
And she was my best friend,

16:06.933 --> 16:10.802
And i supported
anything she did.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.271
And when dalton academy
burned down,

16:13.273 --> 16:17.075
She refused
to let gay blaine

16:17.077 --> 16:19.911
And the warblers
join in the glee club.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.547
And i knew it was time
to blow the whistle.

16:23.950 --> 16:28.920
I am so much happier
now that i am free from sue,

16:28.922 --> 16:31.622
And i got a hot boyfriend.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.325
He takes me there every time.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.994
And all of those
cheerios! Out there,

16:35.996 --> 16:38.930
Quit being such basic bitches.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.466
Don't let sue sylvester
control you.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.067
You deserve better.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.437
(newscast music playing)
we'll be right back.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.944
Get out of my face!

16:52.946 --> 16:54.379
I'm sorry this isn't going

16:54.381 --> 16:56.147
The way you intended.
Not really.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.316
Are we rolling?
We're not rolling, are we?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.951
No, no, we're in commercial
right now.

16:59.953 --> 17:03.454
Geraldo, the foundations
of my entire life

17:03.456 --> 17:04.856
Have been destroyed.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.191
All i ever wanted
was to be a champion,

17:07.193 --> 17:08.393
And to inspire others

17:08.395 --> 17:09.727
To be champions.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.329
That's why i chose a career
in cheerleading.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.197
Just wanted
to succeed

17:13.199 --> 17:15.500
By watching my girls succeed.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.835
Tough world out there, geraldo.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.470
I wanted them to be tougher.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.139
Smarter.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.042
I wish you had interviewed some
of my more successful cheerios!,

17:24.044 --> 17:26.144
Like quinn fabray,
currently enrolled at yale;

17:26.146 --> 17:29.180
Brittany s. Pierce,
math prodigy, m.I.T.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.883
Santana lopez was
a broadway understudy

17:31.885 --> 17:34.052
And now could have
a very promising career

17:34.054 --> 17:36.020
As a high-class prostitute.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.989
We did actually
reach out to them.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.058
All three declined
to comment.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.926
Wait.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.027
Are the cameras rolling?

17:43.029 --> 17:45.696
Yeah, i lied. I lied.
We didn't go to commercial.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.098
The camera's been rolling
the whole time.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.766
Classy, rivera;
that's very classy.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.168
You know what
this is?

17:50.170 --> 17:51.536
This is
a character assassination.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.371
This interview
is a hack job

17:53.373 --> 17:55.273
Unworthy of the name fox news,

17:55.275 --> 17:57.175
A global brand
known worldwide

17:57.177 --> 17:59.744
For being fair and balanced.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.112
And it's unworthy of you,
my friend.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.114
I agreed to sit
down with you

18:03.116 --> 18:05.016
Because you're a titan
of american television,

18:05.018 --> 18:07.852
Known for weird,
shirtless selfies,

18:07.854 --> 18:10.121
Getting chaired in the face
by a white supremacist,

18:10.123 --> 18:14.192
And not finding anything
whatsoever in al capone's vault.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.228
When i took the reins
at mckinley high,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.964
It was a cesspool of hate.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.066
And it was my vigilance
and tough love

18:22.068 --> 18:24.635
That turned that place
into a no-bully zone

18:24.637 --> 18:27.438
Where the most vulnerable
were protected.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.240
Well, sue, we have an interview

18:29.242 --> 18:32.043
With, uh, someone who does agree
with your assessment,

18:32.045 --> 18:33.611
Your position.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.447
We are choosing to protect
their identity though--

18:36.449 --> 18:38.449
The voice has been altered.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.051
Take a look.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.886
(deep distorted voice): I'll say
it till the cows come home:

18:41.888 --> 18:43.054
Sue sylvester saved my life.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.390
I was in an abusive marriage

18:46.392 --> 18:48.960
To a man they call cooter
the football recruiter,

18:48.962 --> 18:51.462
And sue supported me
leaving him.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.265
Also, when i chose
to transition,

18:54.267 --> 18:57.001
Sue supported that, too.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.337
Hey, wait,
why are the lights off?

19:01.307 --> 19:04.242
(deep distorted voice): I'm not
trying to hide my identity.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.177
I'm proud to stand up
for sue sylvester.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.848
I am as i am,
geraldo rivera.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.117
And i refuse to
apologize to you

19:13.119 --> 19:15.319
Or anybody else.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.156
Am i a tough customer?
You bet your bottom dollar i am.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.657
But that's the way
i was raised.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.360
As you may or may not know,
my parents were nazi hunters.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.162
And the lies continue.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.965
No, we weren't nazi hunters.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.368
Her father and i
just told her that

19:30.370 --> 19:33.137
So it would give us a good
excuse not to be around her.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.306
Little susan was a biter.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.774
She was nasty

19:36.776 --> 19:38.109
From the day she was born.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.678
She even bit my lip
on her way out.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.213
It was weird.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.016
What kind of a newborn
has a full set of teeth?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.218
What can i say?

19:47.220 --> 19:50.488
From the minute
i laid eyes on her,

19:50.490 --> 19:53.958
I knew that susan
would always be

19:53.960 --> 19:57.361
The daughter that
i just couldn't love.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.232
"the daughter that i
just couldn't love."

20:01.234 --> 20:03.034
That must be hard to hear.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.237
"the daughter that
i just couldn't love."

20:10.910 --> 20:14.445
¶ ¶

20:27.527 --> 20:30.428
So who is sue sylvester?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.929
Really?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.565
Is she a lying,
vindictive psychopath?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.100
Is she a career criminal

20:36.102 --> 20:38.236
Who has endangered the lives
of countless children

20:38.238 --> 20:40.571
And actually deserves
to be behind bars?

20:40.573 --> 20:44.175
For the final word, let's go
to one of sue's coworkers

20:44.177 --> 20:46.877
And show choir director
william schuester.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.781
Until next time,
i'm geraldo rivera reporting.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.018
Have i had my problems with sue?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.553
(laughs)

20:55.555 --> 20:57.455
You bet.

20:57.457 --> 21:01.359
She has made my life miserable
for as long as i can remember.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.793
(sighs)

21:02.795 --> 21:04.895
But that's because
she's a fighter

21:04.897 --> 21:07.431
And someone who refuses
to betray her own values.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.934
And i'd be lying if i said
her cutthroat spirit

21:09.936 --> 21:12.203
Didn't keep everyone around here
on their toes,

21:12.205 --> 21:15.473
Striving to work harder
and be better.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.874
Oh, don't get me wrong.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.143
She is not a nice person.

21:19.145 --> 21:22.747
But the fact is
she's an outstanding teacher

21:22.749 --> 21:25.549
And a born leader...

21:25.551 --> 21:29.220
And mckinley high is
a worse place without her.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.389
She deserves a second chance,

21:31.391 --> 21:33.324
And that's exactly what
i told the superintendant.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.393
(laughs softly)

21:36.929 --> 21:39.497
I'm going to bat for you, sue.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.565
(dark, dramatic music playing)

22:00.920 --> 22:03.254
Okay, that's
enough, thank you.

22:03.256 --> 22:05.389
Thank you for being the
soundtrack for my melancholia.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.460
Hello, "mother."

22:09.462 --> 22:12.296
Hello, susan.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.265
Thank you for
agreeing to meet me.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.467
I know this must be
difficult for you.

22:16.469 --> 22:20.371
"difficult" doesn't begin
to describe it, mother.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.940
You've been lying
to me for years.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.942
Susan, does it really matter

22:24.944 --> 22:26.510
That your father
and i were working

22:26.512 --> 22:30.348
In the accounts receivable
department at ma bell

22:30.350 --> 22:33.384
While you thought we were
out chasing nazis? (laughs)

22:33.386 --> 22:36.120
That's not the lie
i'm talking about.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.154
You never loved me.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.457
No, technically,
that's not a lie,

22:39.459 --> 22:41.892
Because i never really told you
that i did love you.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.895
You know, it would be very
easy to be angry at you.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.331
But i've just spent
the last few days

22:47.333 --> 22:49.333
At the greater columbus
convention center

22:49.335 --> 22:52.336
Attending oprah's "the life
you want weekend" weekend.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.904
And there i learned

22:53.906 --> 22:56.540
That relationships
are a two-way street.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.543
I realize i wasn't
the easiest kid.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.480
My earliest memories are of
trying to light you on fire.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.751
I want to apologize for
all the booby traps.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.052
And the biting.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.489
Oh, susan, your father
and i really did love you.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.325
We just had an odd way of
showing it, that's all.

23:14.327 --> 23:17.495
We never did get the hang
of that parenting thing.

23:17.497 --> 23:21.432
I always wanted you to
do what i wanted to do,

23:21.434 --> 23:25.269
But you wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

23:25.271 --> 23:28.706
Oh, i remember how much i loved
those old movie musicals,

23:28.708 --> 23:31.442
And you couldn't
stand them.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.277
Every time i took
you to a matinee,

23:33.279 --> 23:36.514
You'd start crying and
screaming and biting

23:36.516 --> 23:39.283
And trying to
set me on fire.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.052
Five minutes in, i realized
i had to take you home.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.888
Mother, i'm sorry,
but sitting through a musical

23:43.890 --> 23:45.456
Is torture for me.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.458
How do people
just burst into song?

23:47.460 --> 23:49.460
How does everybody
just magically know the lyrics?

23:49.462 --> 23:50.428
I'm sorry.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.729
Don't apologize.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.398
I'm the one who should
be saying i'm sorry.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.401
I'm sorry i never was the
mother i should have been.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.403
I'm sorry i
lied to you.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.440
I'm sorry i missed
out on your life.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.109
It's okay to be
angry, sweetheart.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.711
You're going to be angry
for quite a while.

24:07.713 --> 24:11.115
I just hope that someday
you and i can sit down,

24:11.117 --> 24:14.752
Have a cup of coffee
or something,

24:14.754 --> 24:17.621
If not as mother
and daughter, then...

24:17.623 --> 24:19.623
Just as friends.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.459
I would like that.
Hold on.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.460
I have a question
for you.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.628
What?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.464
Were you and dad
ever in love?

24:26.466 --> 24:29.066
Well, of course
we were.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.469
We fell in love
when we first met,

24:31.471 --> 24:32.670
On a trolley.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.306
And you would like to sing
about it, wouldn't you?

24:35.308 --> 24:36.474
Yes.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.175
Then i will sing
with you.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.610
Well, you hate musicals.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.445
But i love the sound
of my own voice.

24:41.447 --> 24:42.446
Okay, band nerds.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.414
"trolley song," a flat.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.583
(trolley bell dings)

24:45.585 --> 24:48.519
("the trolley song" from
<i>meet me in st. Louis</i> begins)

24:50.656 --> 24:54.492
¶ with my high-starched collar
and my high-topped shoes ¶

24:54.494 --> 24:57.161
¶ and my hair piled
high upon my head ¶

24:57.163 --> 25:00.364
¶ i went to lose a jolly
hour on the trolley ¶

25:00.366 --> 25:03.634
¶ and lost my
heart instead ¶

25:03.636 --> 25:07.271
¶ with his light brown derby
and his bright green tie ¶

25:07.273 --> 25:09.874
¶ he was quite
the handsomest of men ¶

25:09.876 --> 25:11.842
¶ i started to yen ¶

25:11.844 --> 25:13.544
¶ so i counted to ten ¶

25:13.546 --> 25:17.281
¶ then i counted to ten again ¶

25:20.553 --> 25:23.454
¶ clang, clang, clang
went the trolley ¶

25:23.456 --> 25:26.457
¶ ding, ding, ding
went the bell ¶

25:26.459 --> 25:29.460
¶ zing, zing, zing
went my heartstrings ¶

25:29.462 --> 25:32.463
¶ from the moment i saw him,
i fell ¶

25:34.534 --> 25:37.701
¶ chug, chug, chug
went the motor ¶

25:37.703 --> 25:41.138
¶ bump, bump, bump
went the brakes ¶

25:41.140 --> 25:44.141
¶ thump, thump, thump
went my heartstrings ¶

25:44.143 --> 25:48.546
¶ when he smiled,
i could feel the car shake ¶

25:48.548 --> 25:50.748
¶ he tipped his hat
and took a seat ¶

25:50.750 --> 25:54.752
¶ he said he hoped he hadn't
stepped upon my feet ¶

25:54.754 --> 25:58.188
¶ he asked my name,
i held my breath ¶

25:58.190 --> 26:02.059
¶ i couldn't speak because
he scared me half to death ¶

26:02.061 --> 26:04.995
¶ buzz, buzz, buzz
went the buzzer ¶

26:04.997 --> 26:08.399
¶ plop, plop, plop
went the wheels ¶

26:08.401 --> 26:11.001
¶ stop, stop, stop
went my heartstrings ¶

26:11.003 --> 26:12.770
¶ as he started to leave ¶

26:12.772 --> 26:16.607
¶ i took hold of his sleeve
with my hand ¶

26:16.609 --> 26:19.777
¶ and as if it were planned ¶

26:19.779 --> 26:21.011
¶ he stayed on with me ¶

26:21.013 --> 26:22.413
¶ and it was grand ¶

26:22.415 --> 26:25.883
¶ just to stand with his hand
holding mine ¶

26:25.885 --> 26:30.721
¶ to the end of the line... ¶

26:30.723 --> 26:33.023
¶ zing, zing, zing, zing ¶

26:33.025 --> 26:37.127
¶ went my heart.... ¶

26:40.533 --> 26:41.532
(music ends)

26:41.534 --> 26:42.700
(laughs):
Oh, oh!

26:42.702 --> 26:44.101
Thank you, susan.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.104
Okay, let's just make
sure nothing like this

26:47.106 --> 26:48.439
Ever happens again.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.707
I promise.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.579
So carmen tibideaux
actually told you

26:55.581 --> 26:56.880
To get out of
her office?

26:56.882 --> 26:58.382
Look, you're missing
the point, okay?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.651
She said that she could see that
i was humble, that i was sorry,

27:00.653 --> 27:02.152
Which means that
i can't give up.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.154
There's still
a chance.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.656
Rachel, i think
that you may be reading

27:05.658 --> 27:07.391
A little too much into this.
I don't think so.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.760
Yeah, i mean, anyone named madam
tibideaux doesn't really seem

27:09.762 --> 27:11.161
Like a woman who
changes her mind

27:11.163 --> 27:13.163
Or stays in human
form for too long.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.399
I always thought nyada
was a school for witches.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.767
What i think sam
is trying to say is

27:16.769 --> 27:18.168
That you're just reaching
a little bit.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.571
If you remember, i got
kicked out of nyada, too.

27:20.573 --> 27:21.605
Carmen cut me herself.

27:21.607 --> 27:22.806
Like, with a knife

27:22.808 --> 27:24.074
Because she wanted your blood
for potions?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.643
No, because she's not a witch.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.578
Look, you guys,
i could see it in her eyes.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.146
She was moved
momentarily.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.281
And for that moment,
i saw myself back in nyada,

27:31.283 --> 27:33.617
Back on track before my life
got completely derailed.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.152
Which is why i'm writing
her this letter.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.654
And i'm putting all of
my humiliation out there,

27:36.656 --> 27:38.656
All of the bad reviews
and the good reviews,

27:38.658 --> 27:40.591
A-and the good glee club
reviews, and she's gonna see it,

27:40.593 --> 27:41.759
She's gonna give me
another chance,

27:41.761 --> 27:42.960
And i'm gonna get back in.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.595
Look, we're all

27:44.597 --> 27:45.929
Behind you 100 percent

27:45.931 --> 27:47.998
Getting your life back on track,
but i think

27:48.000 --> 27:49.700
That you clinging on to nyada,
(phone vibrates)

27:49.702 --> 27:50.868
I don't think...
Wait a minute.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.703
This-this is
a-a new york number.

27:52.705 --> 27:53.871
I think this could be her.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.806
I have to go t-take this.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.374
Hello, this is rachel.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.842
Okay, i don't think
this is healthy.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.477
Yeah, i don't think
these are even

28:00.479 --> 28:01.712
Actual press clippings
about the glee club.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.647
These are just from
jacob ben israel's blog.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.683
Guys, i think we should
just be good friends

28:05.685 --> 28:07.618
And support her
about going back to college.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.186
Shh, she's coming.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.821
What is it?
Was it nyada?

28:10.823 --> 28:13.891
That was the producer
for the russell simmons musical

28:13.893 --> 28:15.492
Of the audition
that you put me up for.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.494
I-i don't know,
i totally forgot about it,

28:17.496 --> 28:19.129
But... I got it.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.332
A-and they-they want me
to start in, like, a few weeks.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.734
Oh, my god!

28:23.736 --> 28:24.735
Rachel, see,

28:24.737 --> 28:26.170
Your life is already
back on track.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.237
I totally forgot
about it...

28:27.239 --> 28:28.338
Oh, congratulations.
Thank you.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.907
What about
going back to school?

28:29.909 --> 28:31.842
You know what,
maybe you guys are right.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.712
I don't need to be just forcing
this to happen with school.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.714
You know, i don't have
to go to nyada.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.383
This is really exciting.
I'm gonna go tell kurt.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.988
And a-five, six, seven, eight.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.824
One, two, three, four,

28:46.826 --> 28:48.392
Five, six, seven, eight.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.993
One, two, three, four,

28:49.995 --> 28:51.829
Five, six, seven, eight.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.531
(slowing):
One, two, three, four,

28:54.533 --> 28:55.733
Five, six, seven...

28:55.735 --> 28:57.167
Come on!

28:57.169 --> 28:58.769
This choreography is about
as rudimentary as it gets.

28:58.771 --> 29:01.271
And you guys aren't even close.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.173
Okay, that-that is enough, guys.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.576
We're a team, and a team is
comprised of people

29:05.578 --> 29:07.277
With individual strengths
and weaknesses.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.246
Are we a team?
Because look at us.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.882
Half of us are wearing uniforms
from a different school.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.050
Kurt:
She's right.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.184
There is a major disconnect.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.285
We've got to make some changes.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.222
Teams wear uniforms--
better grab a blazer.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.723
You guys would look
great in blazers.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.058
This is
mckinley, dude.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.727
Yeah, your sexist empire
doesn't even exist.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.229
Our look is iconic.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.798
Synonymous with
tradition and excellence.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.702
Not to mention,
it elevates anyone who wears it

29:31.704 --> 29:33.804
To sex-symbol status.

29:33.806 --> 29:34.905
Wait, i'll take one.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.473
Women love these.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.875
Do they?

29:37.877 --> 29:38.976
Come on, guys,
we've welcomed you

29:38.978 --> 29:40.144
To our school
with open arms.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.278
Semi-open.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.279
You can't expect us

29:42.281 --> 29:43.714
To adopt your uniforms, too.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.282
But, you know,
it would save us the effort

29:45.284 --> 29:46.717
Of having to try
and find a new look.

29:46.719 --> 29:48.719
Okay, look, you guys,
we've had a lot of success

29:48.721 --> 29:49.720
With this in the past,

29:49.722 --> 29:50.821
So we'll just give you
our uniforms

29:50.823 --> 29:52.089
To wear
during the competition.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.725
Red t-shirts and converse
are not uniforms.

29:54.727 --> 29:55.893
You have costumes.

29:55.895 --> 29:56.927
Will:
Guys, enough!

29:56.929 --> 29:58.962
We need to have some
unity here, okay?

30:01.066 --> 30:03.333
Look, you attend
mckinley now.

30:03.335 --> 30:07.070
I'm really sorry, guys,
but the blazers need to go.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.506
We are grateful that you've
welcomed us to your school,

30:09.508 --> 30:11.141
And to be performing
with you guys,

30:11.143 --> 30:13.977
But we didn't choose
to come here.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.979
You always talk about
how important glee club

30:15.981 --> 30:17.981
And-and mckinley is to you;

30:17.983 --> 30:19.817
Well, we felt the same way
about dalton.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.852
And then we watched it
burn to the ground.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.189
These jackets
aren't just uniforms.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.990
They're a tribute.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.927
A last surviving artifact of a
place that meant so much to us.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.262
It's all that we have left.

30:32.264 --> 30:35.866
You pumpkins got bigger problems
than your costumes.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.671
I just got word that sue is the
new coach of vocal adrenaline.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.540
(piano plays dramatic melody)

30:44.777 --> 30:46.977
So you get fired
from your old job,

30:46.979 --> 30:49.780
And despite hating show choir

30:49.782 --> 30:51.181
And never having
coached it before,

30:51.183 --> 30:53.217
You're our new coach.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.185
Correction.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.321
I<i> may be</i> your new coach.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.557
If i deem you worthy
of crushing the new directions!

31:00.559 --> 31:02.659
With a national championship

31:02.661 --> 31:05.295
You will be guaranteed
under my tutelage.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.865
And how exactly do we
prove we're worthy?

31:07.867 --> 31:10.500
By surviving the
barf-tron 200.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.703
The what?
The barf-tron 200...

31:12.705 --> 31:16.073
Is a single consecutive
five-hour workout routine

31:16.075 --> 31:18.575
Designed to invoke
maximum nausea.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.011
200 box jumps, 200 pull-ups,

31:21.013 --> 31:23.513
200 burpies, 200 wall balls,

31:23.515 --> 31:27.651
200 double-unders,
and 200 consecutive run-throughs

31:27.653 --> 31:30.153
Of frank stallone's
"far from over,"

31:30.155 --> 31:32.890
Made famous by john travolta's
triumphant performance

31:32.892 --> 31:33.891
In<i> staying alive,</i>

31:33.893 --> 31:37.027
The best sequel of all time.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.263
(frank stallone's
"far from over" begins)
¶ da, da-da ¶

31:39.265 --> 31:41.231
¶ da, da ¶

31:41.233 --> 31:44.534
¶ da-da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da ¶

31:44.536 --> 31:48.272
¶ this is the end ¶

31:48.274 --> 31:51.608
¶ you made your choice,
and now my chance is over... ¶

31:51.610 --> 31:53.243
Come on!

31:53.245 --> 31:56.546
¶ i thought i was in ¶

31:56.548 --> 31:58.615
¶ you put me down and say ¶

31:58.617 --> 32:01.451
¶ i'm going nowhere... ¶
i am pushing you harder

32:01.453 --> 32:03.053
Than you've ever
been pushed before.

32:03.055 --> 32:06.056
¶ save me, darling ¶

32:06.058 --> 32:09.159
¶ i am down,
but i am far from over ¶

32:11.563 --> 32:14.564
¶ give me something ¶

32:14.566 --> 32:17.768
¶ i need it all,
'cause i am running over... ¶

32:17.770 --> 32:19.136
Sue:
<i>You think this is hard?</i>

32:19.138 --> 32:21.038
Try taking down a gazelle

32:21.040 --> 32:23.106
With your bare hands!
That's hard!

32:23.108 --> 32:24.808
(rhythmic humming)

32:30.082 --> 32:31.882
We're only halfway there!

32:31.884 --> 32:34.584
¶ da, da-da ¶

32:34.586 --> 32:35.786
¶ da, da ¶

32:35.788 --> 32:37.988
¶ da, da, da, da, da... ¶

32:37.990 --> 32:39.990
I am now pushing you harder

32:39.992 --> 32:43.126
Than the level at which
i was previously pushing you!

32:43.128 --> 32:45.162
(rhythmic humming)

32:49.335 --> 32:50.400
That doesn't look hard at all!

32:50.402 --> 32:52.002
Just passing the ball
back and forth?

32:52.004 --> 32:55.038
Sit up straight
and engage those abs!

32:57.843 --> 33:00.777
¶ save me, darling ¶

33:00.779 --> 33:05.415
¶ i am down,
but i am far from over ¶

33:06.685 --> 33:09.486
¶ give me something ¶

33:09.488 --> 33:12.923
¶ i need it all
'cause i am running over... ¶

33:12.925 --> 33:14.925
Hey, ladies,
good luck with menopause

33:14.927 --> 33:19.029
If this is how fit you are
at the peak of your physicality!

33:19.031 --> 33:21.865
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

33:21.867 --> 33:24.034
(rhythmic humming)

33:29.975 --> 33:31.942
(music builds)

33:33.812 --> 33:35.312
(music ends)

33:35.314 --> 33:37.514
All right, everyone, take five.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.817
And then we're doing it
all over again.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.986
Sue sylvester,

33:42.988 --> 33:45.455
I think i speak
for all of vocal adrenaline

33:45.457 --> 33:47.724
When i say we'd be honored

33:47.726 --> 33:50.761
To have you as our coach.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.834
Sam, good, i need your help;
we have to figure out

33:57.836 --> 33:59.202
What to do with this
whole warbler crisis,

33:59.204 --> 34:00.871
Especially now that sue
is on the attack.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.305
So here, will you
put this jacket on?

34:02.307 --> 34:03.707
Um, i think you're making
a mistake.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.042
With the jacket?
It's just a jacket.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.810
Look, we have to commit to this
and just tell our kids

34:06.812 --> 34:08.011
That this is
what we're doing, okay?

34:08.013 --> 34:09.346
The warbler's school
burned down.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.081
If this is gonna give them
a little bit of comfort,

34:11.083 --> 34:12.499
Then it's the least we could do.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.916
I mean about taking
that part in new york.

34:13.919 --> 34:14.918
What about nyada?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.720
What about nyada?

34:16.722 --> 34:17.888
Look,

34:17.890 --> 34:19.056
Mercedes was right.
It's pathetic,

34:19.058 --> 34:20.490
And worse than that,
it's desperate

34:20.492 --> 34:22.159
To cling to the idea
of going back there.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.761
(phone vibrating)
it's not pathetic to go back.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.065
Hello, this is rachel.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.983
I...

34:54.426 --> 34:56.426
That was
carmen tibideaux.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.428
I'm back in nyada
if i want to be.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.797
That's amazing! Oh, my gosh,
i knew, i knew that you could

35:00.799 --> 35:02.065
Just do it,
i told you.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.233
That's what i said.
Did i not say that?

35:03.235 --> 35:04.468
I'm not going back there.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.236
What?

35:06.238 --> 35:08.038
Sam, i just want to go back
to new york a winner,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.706
Not with my tail
between my legs.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.209
And mercedes is happy for me,
kurt is happy for me,

35:12.211 --> 35:14.044
Blaine's happy for me.
Why can't you be?

35:14.046 --> 35:15.612
You're the person

35:15.614 --> 35:17.981
Who matters the most;
just be happy for me.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.250
I'm telling you the truth, okay,
not just what you want to hear.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.819
Yet you said that i was destined
to be back in new york.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.887
Yeah, but not like this.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.489
Like what?
What's wrong with this?

35:25.491 --> 35:27.057
This is what i wanted!

35:27.059 --> 35:29.159
No, what you wanted was
a second chance to get it right,

35:29.161 --> 35:30.894
And carmen
just gave that to you, okay?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.229
If you throw all that away,

35:32.231 --> 35:35.632
You're gonna be making the same
mistakes all over again.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.434
Look, rachel, come on, stop.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.668
It's not a mistake.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.304
Me going back to my life
and who i was

35:41.306 --> 35:43.140
Is not a mistake.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.176
I just think that
in this day and age,

35:46.178 --> 35:48.311
It's insane not to get
a college education, you know?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.579
But, sam, you're
not in college.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.248
Well, i know,
but i don't want rachel

35:51.250 --> 35:52.082
To make my mistakes that i...

35:52.084 --> 35:53.583
Rachel is a big girl.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.285
She's gonna take care of
herself, okay? We just have...

35:55.287 --> 35:57.354
(organ playing europe's
"the final countdown")

36:04.496 --> 36:06.229
Oh, my lord, this is serious.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.201
Sue, what are you doing?

36:11.203 --> 36:12.836
I'm making a statement.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.439
You've crossed me
for the last time,

36:16.441 --> 36:18.341
William schuester.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.944
Do you have any idea
how many times you've said that?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.646
And it still feels good.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.182
You betrayed me,

36:25.184 --> 36:28.285
And i am taking it upon myself
to destroy the glee club

36:28.287 --> 36:32.155
And you once and for all.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.292
And i know i've said
that before, too!

36:35.294 --> 36:37.227
Betray you?

36:37.229 --> 36:39.129
Okay, everyone else
betrayed you, sue.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.864
There were two people
geraldo interviewed

36:40.866 --> 36:43.300
That stood up for you,
and i was one of them.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.302
Silence!

36:46.738 --> 36:47.571
Brad?

36:47.573 --> 36:50.473
("the final countdown" resumes)

36:52.811 --> 36:56.146
Oh, don't even think
that you can out-europe me, sue.

36:56.148 --> 36:59.950
I saw them play live at the
franklin county fair in 1993.

37:09.161 --> 37:14.164
¶ ooh... ¶

37:14.166 --> 37:18.335
¶ we're leaving together ¶

37:18.337 --> 37:23.173
¶ but still it's farewell ¶

37:23.175 --> 37:27.277
¶ and maybe we'll come back ¶

37:27.279 --> 37:30.714
¶ to earth, who can tell? ¶

37:30.716 --> 37:35.285
¶ i guess there is
no one to blame ¶

37:35.287 --> 37:38.788
¶ we're leaving ground ¶

37:38.790 --> 37:44.794
¶ will things ever be
the same again? ¶

37:44.796 --> 37:48.832
¶ it's the final countdown ¶

37:53.605 --> 37:57.007
¶ the final countdown ¶

37:59.244 --> 38:04.614
¶ oh... Oh! ¶

38:07.286 --> 38:09.185
(guitars playing rapidly)

38:18.330 --> 38:20.263
Oh, my god,
they've gone crazy.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.465
We can't let this
happen to us.

38:29.908 --> 38:33.510
¶ the final countdown ¶

38:35.280 --> 38:37.681
¶ oh! ¶

38:37.683 --> 38:42.452
¶ it's the final countdown ¶

38:42.454 --> 38:46.623
¶ we're leaving together ¶

38:46.625 --> 38:50.460
¶ final countdown ¶

38:50.462 --> 38:54.464
¶ we'll all miss her so ¶

38:54.466 --> 38:58.168
¶ it's the final countdown ¶

38:58.170 --> 38:59.769
¶ countdown ¶

38:59.771 --> 39:02.172
¶ oh ¶

39:02.174 --> 39:06.042
¶ it's the final countdown! ¶

39:06.044 --> 39:07.210
(music ends, crowd cheering)

39:07.212 --> 39:09.079
(cheering stops abruptly)

39:23.061 --> 39:24.861
I mean, it was so weird
to see you and sue

39:24.863 --> 39:26.496
Do a fantasy air guitar battle.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.465
Weird and
borderline psychopathic.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.467
I feel so awful
you guys had to see that.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.468
But i'm done.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.669
I...

39:32.671 --> 39:34.571
<i>We</i> are gonna beat sue
at sectionals.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.507
Well, looks like sue is
the least of our worries.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.008
I just got
cornered by myron.

39:39.010 --> 39:42.312
Rachel berry, uncle bob just
told me devastating news!

39:42.314 --> 39:44.414
The bottom line is
if new directions doesn't win,

39:44.416 --> 39:46.483
Not only will the glee club
get the ax,

39:46.485 --> 39:48.818
But all arts and music programs
will be wiped from the school.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.088
But what am i supposed to do
with all my sequin jackets?!

39:52.090 --> 39:53.823
That's impossible;
i'm paying for the glee club

39:53.825 --> 39:54.991
Out of my own pocket.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.426
That's what i said!

39:56.428 --> 39:57.761
But that's impossible.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.362
Rachel berry is paying
for the glee club

39:59.364 --> 40:00.330
Out of her own pocket.

40:00.332 --> 40:02.499
But this goes beyond
what she can afford,

40:02.501 --> 40:04.501
And this is also
about allocation

40:04.503 --> 40:06.169
Of facilities and resources.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.772
I mean, that choir room has to
go back to being a computer lab

40:08.774 --> 40:10.373
Or at least another classroom.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.408
(shrieks)

40:11.410 --> 40:12.909
I just can't believe it

40:12.911 --> 40:14.377
After everything that
we've been through.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.678
This could be worse.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.113
We've survived
far more difficult things,

40:17.115 --> 40:18.782
Not just in glee club,
but in life.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.586
You know, screw it.
We've had to fight

40:23.588 --> 40:25.121
For everything
we've earned in our lives,

40:25.123 --> 40:26.656
And this is just the beginning
of a new fight.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.392
I am so proud of you all.

40:29.394 --> 40:32.529
And as badly as i want
to save the arts,

40:32.531 --> 40:34.264
My greatest accomplishment

40:34.266 --> 40:36.466
Are the people sitting
in front of me right now.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.736
We never give up,
and we never will.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.071
Well, if only we could just
agree on costumes to wear

40:42.073 --> 40:43.807
For the most important
competition of our lives.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.442
That might actually be
one problem

40:45.444 --> 40:46.843
That we may have fixed.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.746
("rise" begins)

40:49.748 --> 40:52.816
(rhythmic humming)

41:08.767 --> 41:10.767
¶ have you ever felt
like you woke up ¶

41:10.769 --> 41:13.503
¶ on the wrong side
of your heart? ¶

41:13.505 --> 41:16.005
¶ has it ever felt
like it's broken ¶

41:16.007 --> 41:18.508
¶ like the world
tore it apart? ¶

41:18.510 --> 41:20.910
¶ have you felt so weak ¶

41:20.912 --> 41:22.579
¶ you could hardly stand? ¶

41:22.581 --> 41:24.180
¶ like if you ever fell,
you could never tell ¶

41:24.182 --> 41:26.749
¶ if you'd ever
get back up again ¶

41:28.520 --> 41:30.687
¶ i know it's hard to do ¶

41:30.689 --> 41:32.922
¶ but i think you can make it ¶

41:32.924 --> 41:35.758
¶ 'cause i know we can take it ¶

41:35.760 --> 41:37.427
¶ baby, we will ¶

41:37.429 --> 41:38.628
¶ rise ¶

41:38.630 --> 41:41.531
¶ we are young,
we are the dreamers ¶

41:41.533 --> 41:44.934
¶ we will fly ¶

41:44.936 --> 41:46.703
¶ when the world
will not believe us ¶

41:46.705 --> 41:49.539
¶ we will rise above the ashes ¶

41:49.541 --> 41:53.977
¶ before this whole life
passes us by ¶

41:53.979 --> 41:55.512
¶ you and i ¶

41:55.514 --> 41:58.548
¶ we will rise ¶

41:58.550 --> 42:00.550
(rhythmic humming)

42:07.859 --> 42:09.726
¶ la, la, la, la ¶

42:09.728 --> 42:12.829
¶ la, la, la, la ¶

42:12.831 --> 42:14.831
¶ oh, we will ¶

42:14.833 --> 42:18.568
¶ we will rise ¶

42:18.570 --> 42:20.703
¶ we are young,
we are the dreamers ¶

42:20.705 --> 42:24.007
¶ we will fly ¶

42:24.009 --> 42:26.342
¶ when the world
will not believe us ¶

42:26.344 --> 42:28.478
¶ we will rise above the ashes ¶

42:28.480 --> 42:33.082
¶ before this whole life
passes us by ¶

42:33.084 --> 42:35.218
¶ you and i ¶

42:35.220 --> 42:39.522
¶ we will rise ¶

42:39.524 --> 42:42.258
¶ yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah ¶

42:42.260 --> 42:44.994
¶ we will rise ¶

42:44.996 --> 42:46.563
¶ we will rise ¶

42:46.565 --> 42:48.565
¶ we will rise above the ashes ¶

42:48.567 --> 42:51.267
¶ before this whole life
passes us by ¶

42:51.269 --> 42:52.936
¶ oh, yeah ¶

42:52.938 --> 42:59.208
¶ you and i, we will rise! ¶

42:59.210 --> 43:01.277
