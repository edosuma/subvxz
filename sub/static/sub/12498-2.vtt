03:54.379 --> 03:56.529
But It Certainly
Made <I>Me</I> Uncomfortable.

03:57.163 --> 04:01.497
Heard It Went Well
In The Big Apple.
Yeah, It Was, Uh...

04:01.498 --> 04:04.516
It Wasn't Easy Prying Owen
Out Of Big Boy Brett's Clutches.

04:04.581 --> 04:05.712
I Can Imagine.

04:06.140 --> 04:09.440
So What'll It Be To Celebrate?
A Cup Of Sully's Finest Sludge?

04:09.826 --> 04:11.885
With Some Milk And Sugar
To Wash It Down.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.233
Make It For The Road?

04:14.234 --> 04:15.240
Sure.

04:18.469 --> 04:20.082
How's He Doing--Owen?

04:20.083 --> 04:23.953
Well, He's Back In The House,
But It's Gotta Be Rough.

04:24.455 --> 04:25.355
I Can Imagine.

04:25.356 --> 04:27.238
Still, It's Gotta Be
Some Comfort

04:27.285 --> 04:28.902
Knowing He's Got
A Friend Like You.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.645
* Untold *

04:34.487 --> 04:35.652
It Good To Be Back.

04:36.298 --> 04:37.677
It's Good
Having You Back.

04:40.525 --> 04:44.649
So... Ready To Start Reliving
The Famed "Hail Eddie"?

04:44.890 --> 04:46.666
Don't You Think People
Are Sick Of That By Now?

04:46.667 --> 04:48.633
I Mean,
It's Been Ten Years.
Are You Kidding?

04:48.634 --> 04:50.443
They're Still Talking About
The Time Larry Bird Stopped

04:50.444 --> 04:52.174
At The Cumberland Farms
To Ask For Directions.

04:52.175 --> 04:56.083
1989. Bird Was Trying To Get
To The U2 Concert In Worcester.

04:56.084 --> 04:59.476
He Made A Wrong Turn Off 128,
Stopped In For A Map,

04:59.477 --> 05:01.841
A Large Ginger Ale
And Two Sticks Of Beef Jerky.

05:01.842 --> 05:04.048
By The Way, Uh,
"Onside Kick-Ass Fries"

05:04.049 --> 05:05.151
Is Not Gonna Fit
On That Board.

05:05.152 --> 05:06.628
We Gotta Come Up
With A New Name.

05:06.749 --> 05:10.718
Yeah, What About, Uh...
"Leave Us Alone Burgers"?
Ha. I Get It.

05:10.719 --> 05:11.830
Rooster.

05:14.885 --> 05:15.779
Sorry.

05:16.964 --> 05:17.706
On The House.

05:17.707 --> 05:19.171
Keep The Change. (Chuckles)

05:20.955 --> 05:22.447
I'll See Ya Later,
Eddie.

05:22.595 --> 05:23.590
Fine.

05:38.967 --> 05:42.136
Nick! Nick!

05:42.360 --> 05:42.944
Hey.

05:42.945 --> 05:44.531
Hey.
Aubrey.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.123
I-I Didn't Mean
To Rattle You.

05:50.124 --> 05:53.501
I'm Not Rattled. Uh...
A Little Rattled.

05:53.502 --> 05:56.700
I Know. I Should Be In Berkeley
Getting Clear Of You, And Yet--

05:56.701 --> 05:58.824
Here You Are.
Here I Am.

05:59.448 --> 06:02.485
So A Funny Thing Happened
On The Way To The Airport.
Huh.

06:02.486 --> 06:03.940
I Closed My Eyes
For A Minute,

06:03.941 --> 06:06.139
And I Saw It--
The End Of My Novel.

06:06.140 --> 06:07.450
You Wrote A Novel?

06:07.677 --> 06:08.984
An Unfinished One--

06:08.985 --> 06:11.969
Unfinished For Years--
All Journey And No Destination.

06:12.282 --> 06:13.389
You Wrote A Novel.

06:14.097 --> 06:16.685
(Chuckles)Nd Thanks To You,
I Finished It.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.746
Because Once I Saw
That Elusive Final Moment,

06:19.946 --> 06:21.572
I Remembered
What You Said In Class.

06:21.573 --> 06:22.496
Hmm?

06:22.496 --> 06:26.084
"The Muse Is Like A Tornado--
When It Hits, Hole Up

06:26.085 --> 06:27.770
"And Don't Come Out
Till It's Leveled

06:27.771 --> 06:29.427
The Last Trailer Park
Of Self-Doubt."

06:29.428 --> 06:30.717
I Said That?
(Laughs)

06:31.352 --> 06:35.468
That's Goofy.
So I Had The Cab Take Me
To The Closest Airport Hotel,

06:35.547 --> 06:37.799
And I've Been Writing
For 48 Hours Straight.

06:37.863 --> 06:39.548
Well, I Can't Wait
To Read It.

06:39.952 --> 06:42.625
It's Not Being Published
Anytime Soon.

06:42.765 --> 06:44.013
No, I Mean I'd Love
To Read It Now.

06:44.014 --> 06:45.610
I Could Even Share
A Few Of My Thoughts

06:45.611 --> 06:46.766
If You're Interested.

06:46.868 --> 06:49.894
I Don't Think
That's Such A Good Idea.
Why Not?

06:50.513 --> 06:52.342
(Bell Tolling)
We're Gonna Be Late
For Class. Come On.

06:53.728 --> 06:55.641
(Man) Well,
It's The Term "Run-On"

06:55.702 --> 06:57.816
That Gives These Sentences
A Bad Name, Right?

06:57.817 --> 07:01.038
I Mean, They're Just Sentences
Trying To Contain Themselves,

07:01.039 --> 07:02.758
Bursting With Emotion.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.340
Ms. Diaz,
How Nice Of You To Join Us.

07:06.674 --> 07:07.970
Well, Hello, Professor Bow.

07:07.971 --> 07:09.785
And Look,
You Brought A Friend.

07:12.553 --> 07:14.823
Uh, Actually, This Is
My Class You're Teaching.

07:14.824 --> 07:16.666
Nicholson Garrett.
Yeah.

07:16.849 --> 07:19.517
(Chuckles) It's A Pleasure.
Duncan Bow, Tremendous Fan.

07:19.518 --> 07:20.676
Oh, Nice To Meet You.

07:20.677 --> 07:23.442
Uh, Dean Etwood Asked Me
To Take The Class.

07:24.147 --> 07:25.475
"Take The Class"?

07:25.476 --> 07:26.896
You Were Gone
For A Few Days.

07:26.897 --> 07:29.415
She Wasn't Sure When You Were...
(Whispers) Coming Back.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.110
Oh, Well... I'm Back Now.

07:33.597 --> 07:35.643
(Laughs) Yes, You Are.
Yes, You Are.

07:35.691 --> 07:38.774
Um, It's--It's Just
That Dean Etwood Asked Me

07:38.775 --> 07:40.772
To Finish Out
The Semester...

07:41.163 --> 07:42.088
For You.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.100
I Think Maybe You Should
Talk To Her About This.

07:46.243 --> 07:48.413
Right. Of Course.

07:48.833 --> 07:52.346
Um, Well, It Looks Like
You're All In Good Hands.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.435
Thank You.

07:54.496 --> 07:57.330
So I'll... See You Soon...

07:58.112 --> 07:59.085
I Hope.

07:59.086 --> 08:00.013
(Woman) Thank You.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.884
Okay, Uh, Where Was I?

08:05.135 --> 08:06.278
Ted's Piece...
* Does Anyone Recall *

08:07.135 --> 08:10.766
I Liked It. It Reminded Me
Of A Fitzgerald Short Story.

08:40.014 --> 08:41.126
What's On The Menu?

08:41.128 --> 08:43.142
Oh, My Signature Dish--

08:43.169 --> 08:45.788
Tuna Casserole,
   But With Chicken.

08:46.144 --> 08:48.366
Not To Be Confused
 With Chicken Casserole.

08:48.367 --> 08:52.321
That's A Whole Different
Noodle-To-Filling Ratio.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.905
   Aha, Jt In Time.

09:00.643 --> 09:02.129
You Gave My Class
 To Duncan Bow?

09:02.130 --> 09:04.249
 I Didn't Know When
   You Were Coming Back.

09:04.432 --> 09:06.416
The Students Are Serious
  About Their Writing,

09:06.417 --> 09:08.441
   And They Need A Professor
 Who's Serious

09:08.442 --> 09:10.987
  About Teaching It To Them.
It Was An Emergency.

09:10.988 --> 09:13.496
 I Got Caught Up
In A "Once In A Lifetime,

09:13.497 --> 09:16.782
Never Gonna Happen Again"
   Emergency.
W-Well, It Was--It Was A Bit...

09:16.986 --> 09:18.548
   It Was A Bit Of A Tangle,
Leslie.

09:18.549 --> 09:20.613
  Dean Etwood, I Am Committed
 To This Class.

09:20.614 --> 09:22.834
 I Am.
 I Don't Wanna Lose It.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.934
Okay, Let  See
 What I Can Do.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.161
   Thank You.

09:31.185 --> 09:33.086
By The Way, What Goes On
 With This Duncan Bow?

09:33.087 --> 09:36.442
Uh, He's One
Of Our Most Popular Teachers.

09:36.443 --> 09:39.756
Several Of His Novels
  Have Had Interest

09:39.757 --> 09:41.552
From Major Publishing Houses,

09:41.553 --> 09:45.142
And One Of His Short Stories
Appeared In "The New Yorker."

09:45.290 --> 09:46.977
He Was The Closest Thing
  Dufresne Had

09:46.978 --> 09:50.571
To A Literary Sensation...
  Until You Came Along.

09:51.069 --> 09:52.329
  I See.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.530
And, Um...

09:55.985 --> 09:57.602
How Did The Rest
Of Your Day Go?

09:57.834 --> 10:00.134
 You Know, We Haven't Seen You
Since You Went To Get The Paper.

10:00.135 --> 10:02.370
  Oh, Yeah, It Was Fine.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.112
Fine--Good Fine?
 Fine--Bad Fine?

10:06.113 --> 10:07.106
  Just Fine.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.457
Well, For The Love Of God, Son,
   What Did She Say?

10:13.385 --> 10:14.645
Hannah?

10:16.666 --> 10:18.030
She Said, "No."

10:18.325 --> 10:19.230
 Okay?

10:19.297 --> 10:20.555
   I Could Go
Into A Lot More Detail,

10:20.556 --> 10:25.392
 But The Bottom Line Is
  Hannah Said No To Me--To Us.

10:25.976 --> 10:28.307
   Sorry.
That's A Tough Break.

10:28.455 --> 10:30.221
 She Really Said No?

10:30.870 --> 10:32.269
She Did, But It's Okay,

10:32.270 --> 10:36.043
   'Cause...
 I Still Believe That One Day,

10:36.159 --> 10:37.582
She'llay Yes.

10:42.116 --> 10:43.884
So What Else Is Going On
 In The World?

10:44.785 --> 10:46.018
  <I>(Man)</I>
    <I>And In Washington Today,</I>

10:46.019 --> 10:48.908
   <I>Congress Held More Hearings</I>
   <I>On Global Warming.</I>

10:49.034 --> 10:51.108
  <I>Today's Focus</I>
 <I>Was On Rising Eans...</I>

10:51.705 --> 10:53.186
Greetings, Earthling.

10:53.245 --> 10:55.113
 I Come Bearing
Hot Fudge Sundae Fixin's.

10:55.114 --> 10:55.998
  Yum.

10:56.930 --> 10:57.834
   Mwah.

10:57.835 --> 10:59.539
Yore My Kind Of Alien.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.403
(Laughs)
  This Is Way Better
  Than Crop Circles.

11:01.404 --> 11:03.356
Oh, That It Is.

11:03.422 --> 11:06.652
You Know What I Love The Most
 About The Ice Cream Sundae?
Tell Me.

11:06.653 --> 11:08.857
It Is Like The Perfect Example
 Of The Melting Pot.

11:08.858 --> 11:11.609
 I Mean, We've Got
Whipped Cream And Ice Cream.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.799
I Mean, That's Two Potentially
  Competitive Forms

11:13.800 --> 11:16.916
 Of Sweetened Cream,
And Yet Here They Are,

11:16.953 --> 11:18.910
Happily Complementing
 Each Other.

11:19.244 --> 11:21.175
   And Then
There's The Hot Fudge,

11:21.176 --> 11:23.290
  Which Is
The Cool Cream's Archnemesis.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.288
  The Screen Look
   A Little Pale To You?

11:26.057 --> 11:27.865
Maybe It's Just The Way
The Light's Hitting It.

11:27.866 --> 11:31.218
  No. No, This Is
  Typical Evening Light.

11:31.296 --> 11:32.596
   Something Is Off.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.529
Hey, Guys.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.808
  Hey, Care To Join Us
For What Iike To Think

11:36.809 --> 11:39.191
  Is A Shining Example
  Of What Our Country Can Be?

11:39.998 --> 11:41.318
   Ice Cream Sundae?

11:42.508 --> 11:44.206
(Laughs) Well, I Don't Mean
To Be Unpatriotic,

11:44.207 --> 11:46.283
But I'm Gonna Head Over
  To Sully's.

11:46.284 --> 11:49.412
Ah, To Bask In The Glory
  Of The "Hail Eddie"?

11:49.413 --> 11:50.823
   Well,
Not So Much Basking

11:50.824 --> 11:53.590
   As, Um, Making
Required Public Appearances.

11:53.790 --> 11:55.183
What's The "Hail Eddie"?

11:58.044 --> 12:01.538
Just The Defining Moment
In Knights Ridge Sports History.

12:01.539 --> 12:02.948
 Mm-Mm.
   (Scoffs)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.615
  It Was Homecoming Weekend.

12:06.616 --> 12:08.633
The League Title
Was On The Line.

12:08.634 --> 12:11.292
   We Were Down By 4
   With Less Than 10 Seconds

12:11.293 --> 12:12.347
  Left On The Clock.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.783
 Eddie Scrambles Out
   Of Two Tackles.

12:14.784 --> 12:18.309
 He Takes This Monster Hit,
   But He Didn't Fall, And Then,

12:18.310 --> 12:20.603
With A Defensive Lineman
  On His <I>Back,</I>

12:20.604 --> 12:23.119
 Eddie Somehow Drags Himself
  Into The End Zone

12:23.120 --> 12:26.057
And Scored
  The Winning Touchdown.
Wow.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.735
  I Have No Knowledge
Of Football Whatsoever.

12:28.736 --> 12:30.010
 That Still Gave Me The Chills.

12:30.011 --> 12:31.955
It Might Just Be
 The Ice Cream.

12:32.686 --> 12:36.393
  Eddie, Does Brian Williams
  Look A Little Pale To You?

12:36.552 --> 12:37.756
Yeah,
He Always Looks Pale.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.404
Not Just Pale. Waxy.

12:40.758 --> 12:42.141
Wan.

12:43.456 --> 12:45.442
 Almost Consumptive.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.970
  Something
 Is Seriously Amiss.

12:55.215 --> 12:55.867
Hey.

12:55.868 --> 12:56.896
Hi.

12:57.999 --> 13:00.252
You Cataldo Men
Clean Up Nicely.

13:00.659 --> 13:01.980
 Well,
  These Are For You.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.313
Thanks.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.389
   The Boys Have
 Something For Sam.
Oh, You Didn't Have To Do That.

13:07.604 --> 13:10.663
  Well, I Wanted To,
 And <I>They</I> Nted To.

13:11.164 --> 13:14.609
 Sam, Jasper And Casper
   Are Here.

13:17.771 --> 13:18.827
Hey.

13:19.213 --> 13:21.752
   We're Sorry
We Broke Your Telescope.

13:21.958 --> 13:26.216
Yeah, We Never Should've Used It
   As Aock-Smashing Device.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.037
 Here.

13:30.046 --> 13:33.299
"Planetarium In A Box."
This Looks Kinda Cool.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.956
(Casper)
   Yeah, When You Plug It In,

13:34.957 --> 13:37.556
   It Turns Your Room
  Into A Planetarium.

13:37.557 --> 13:42.366
 Come On.
Let's Go Set It Up.
  (Casper) Cool.

13:42.465 --> 13:45.680
So... What Was This
All About?

13:45.681 --> 13:48.215
 Well, I Had A Long Talk
 With The Twins,

13:48.316 --> 13:51.909
And Their Days
 Of Tormenting Sam Are Over.

13:53.184 --> 13:54.833
 It's Gonna Be Different
This Time.

13:55.531 --> 13:57.028
  I Promise.

13:59.681 --> 14:02.001
 (Man) Latekka!
(Man) Hail Eddie.

14:02.002 --> 14:02.673
Hey.

14:02.674 --> 14:03.911
  Hey.

14:04.891 --> 14:05.801
   (Man) Hail Eddie!

14:05.802 --> 14:07.734
  At What Point Do You Think
 You're Gonna Get Sick

14:07.735 --> 14:08.705
  Of Reliving That Play?

14:08.706 --> 14:10.786
Oh, Maybe Never.

14:11.252 --> 14:13.660
   Someday I Hope To Do
Something Semi-Noteworthy.

14:13.661 --> 14:14.821
   You Will.

14:16.914 --> 14:17.801
(Owen) Hey, Buddy.

14:17.802 --> 14:18.796
Big O.

14:18.797 --> 14:19.640
  Hey, Janet.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.492
Hey, How You Holdin' Up?

14:21.493 --> 14:23.951
   Not Sure,
 But I Seem To Manage,

14:24.255 --> 14:25.835
  Until It's Time To Go Home.

14:30.332 --> 14:31.704
It Must Be Something,
 Buddy Boy.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.540
   What?

14:32.541 --> 14:34.256
  Being You
On Homecoming Weekend.

14:34.257 --> 14:37.236
It's Like Being Bobby Orr
And Bobby Kennedy

14:37.237 --> 14:39.803
   And Bobby Brown,
All Rolled Up Into One.

14:39.896 --> 14:41.195
Bobby <I>Brown?</I>

14:41.287 --> 14:44.741
I Ran Out Of Famous Bobbys
   From Boston.
 Hey, It Was Your Block

14:44.742 --> 14:46.378
  That Made The "Hail Eddie"
   Possible, Though.

14:46.379 --> 14:48.517
Yeah, But Nobody Ever
Remembers The Lineman.

14:49.162 --> 14:51.651
I Can Only Imagine
The Play You're Gonna Get.

14:54.498 --> 14:55.820
Well, Not Really.

14:55.821 --> 14:58.420
 Are You Kiddin'? Oh,
 And The Icing On The Cake--

14:58.421 --> 15:01.582
I Hear The Lyons Twins--
   Both Now Divorced--

15:01.583 --> 15:04.076
  Are Coming Back For
Tomorrow Night's Pre-Game Bash.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.517
   Can You Say,
"Double Sessions"?

15:12.769 --> 15:14.456
  You Know What, O.?
   I, Um...

15:15.192 --> 15:16.368
   Let Me Talk To You Later.

15:16.369 --> 15:17.596
 (Owen) All Right, Cool.

15:18.555 --> 15:19.789
   Can I Get Some Rings?

15:22.272 --> 15:23.220
  Janet, Are You Okay?

15:23.221 --> 15:24.691
Oh, I'm Fine, Eddie.

15:24.879 --> 15:26.833
   I Just Gotta Get
  These Pitchers Rinsed Out,

15:27.351 --> 15:30.167
 And You Probably Gotta Go Stock
  Up On Matching Prophylactics.

15:30.595 --> 15:31.713
All Right, Listen...

15:32.947 --> 15:35.264
I Should Have Told Him
Was Seeing Someone.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.163
Really?

15:37.164 --> 15:38.311
Really.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.609
   No. I Mean, Really,
 <I>Are</I> You Seeing Someone?

15:42.748 --> 15:44.033
I Am.

15:45.273 --> 15:46.798
And What We Need

15:47.274 --> 15:49.776
Is An Alison Rowan
Birthday Barbecue Do-Over.

15:49.777 --> 15:52.010
You Mean, We Set A Date
   And Then You Stand Me ?

15:52.477 --> 15:56.070
All Right, Maybe Not So Much
A "Do-Over" As A...

15:56.151 --> 15:57.567
A "Get It Right."

15:57.586 --> 15:59.151
 Come With Me
To The Homecoming Game

15:59.152 --> 16:00.473
As My Date.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.584
Everyone Will See Us There.
We'll Get It Out Of The Way.

16:05.260 --> 16:07.662
Okay,
So This Really Is...

16:07.663 --> 16:08.753
A Date.

16:09.397 --> 16:10.639
   Okay.

16:13.197 --> 16:14.131
  Excuse Me.

16:27.035 --> 16:28.223
Who Would've Thought?

16:28.709 --> 16:30.323
Even "The Punter's
  Fried Pickles"

16:30.324 --> 16:31.581
Were Sailing Out Of Here.

16:31.582 --> 16:33.425
  They're Not That Half Bad.

16:33.546 --> 16:35.525
 I May Bring Some
  To Our Tailgate Party.

16:39.521 --> 16:40.831
Or Not.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.098
 Not <I>'Cause</I>
Of The Fried Pickles,

16:43.099 --> 16:46.327
 But I'm Not Be Able To Make
E Tailgate Party This Year.

16:46.328 --> 16:49.557
   But We Do It Every Year--
  Me, You, My Hibachi,

16:49.558 --> 16:51.500
  Your Cassette Of
"Foreigner's Greatest Hits,"

16:51.501 --> 16:53.670
   Our Snide Comments On How
  The Jocks And Cheerleaders

16:53.671 --> 16:55.095
   Have Aged Poorly?

16:55.698 --> 16:57.180
I'm Sorry.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.727
I Have A Date.

17:00.123 --> 17:01.960
You're Going With Eddie,
   Aren't Ya?

17:02.191 --> 17:04.202
Yep. Can You Believe It?

17:04.203 --> 17:06.667
 I'm Going
With Eddie Latekka.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.603
We've Sort Of Been
Seeing Each Other,

17:08.604 --> 17:10.772
  Or At Least Talking
About Seeing Each Other.

17:10.853 --> 17:12.446
And Given The Ridge
And Its Gossip Mill,

17:12.448 --> 17:15.228
Eddie Figured, Whabetter Way
   To Go Public, You Know?

17:15.229 --> 17:17.242
Get It Out Of The Way.
"Get It Out Of The Way"?

17:17.243 --> 17:18.502
All The Chatter.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.329
He--He--He Wants
   To Get It Out Of The Way?

17:21.398 --> 17:24.531
What Are You, Homework?
  Uh, A Trip To The Dentist?

17:24.531 --> 17:26.018
   Taxes? In This World,

17:26.019 --> 17:27.920
  Nothing Is Certain
 Except Death, Taxes

17:27.921 --> 17:31.940
And Letting The World Know
   You're Dating Janet Meadows.
I Thought You'd Be Happy For Me.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.528
We Have To Play
   Within Our League, Janet.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.670
   Remember What Happened When
I Was Dating Christy Turlington?

17:37.799 --> 17:39.869
  It Ended In Heartbreak
 And Tears

17:39.870 --> 17:41.457
  And Utter Devastation.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.512
  You Never Dated
Christy Turlington, Oster.

17:43.513 --> 17:46.065
Exactly,
   And I Never Will.

17:48.552 --> 17:50.611
  I Just Don't Want
To See You Get Hurt.

18:03.689 --> 18:05.033
  Come Here.

18:05.082 --> 18:06.145
Okay.

18:06.226 --> 18:07.639
Keep Working On
   Those Last Few...

18:07.640 --> 18:09.543
Oh, I Will.
 Like I Told You, Okay?

18:10.158 --> 18:11.299
  Nicholson.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.859
   Hello.
How Are You?

18:15.058 --> 18:17.004
Great. How Are You?
  Excellent.

18:17.117 --> 18:18.031
So I Guess You Heard

18:18.032 --> 18:19.590
  I'm Teaching
My Creative Writing Class Again.

18:19.591 --> 18:22.529
I Did, I Did.
And To Be Honest, Thank God.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.080
  My Course Load Was Getting
Much Too Heavy.
Huh.

18:25.081 --> 18:27.367
 Besides, Those Students
   Obviously Enjoy You,

18:27.368 --> 18:28.534
"Quake Boy."

18:29.684 --> 18:32.074
Uh... "Quake Boy"?

18:32.413 --> 18:34.694
   Well, That's How Ms. Diaz
Describes You...

18:34.912 --> 18:36.283
   In Her Novel.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.286
She Gave It To You
 To Read?

18:38.287 --> 18:40.500
She Did. It's A Gem.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.972
And I'm In It?
  Well, Your Fictional Alter Ego
   Certainly Is.

18:43.973 --> 18:47.204
"Rick Garland,
 The Former Next Big Thing."

18:47.618 --> 18:49.723
I Really Wouldn't Have
  Pegged You As A Man Who...

18:49.923 --> 18:52.469
How Did She Describe It?
"Transcends Type.

18:52.470 --> 18:54.853
   "Bookish, Yet Athletic.
Self-Absorbed, Yet Generous.

18:54.854 --> 18:58.266
  "A <I>Lover</I> Whose Touch
Causes Not Only Her Body

18:58.267 --> 19:01.757
  But Her Soul... To Quake."

19:02.831 --> 19:04.516
 Well, She Does Know
How To Turn A Phrase.

19:04.517 --> 19:05.828
 She Certainly Does.

19:06.837 --> 19:08.398
I Really Should
   Go Take Another Look-See.

19:08.399 --> 19:09.990
  I Know She's Anxiously
Awaiting My Notes.
Oh.

19:09.991 --> 19:12.275
  (Whispers)
 I'll See Ya Around.
I'll See Ya.

19:21.741 --> 19:22.822
   So What Do You Think?

19:22.823 --> 19:26.331
Well, The Semiconductors
   Are Shot,

19:26.377 --> 19:27.934
  The Tubes
Are Barely Holding On,

19:27.935 --> 19:30.977
And The High-Vtage Block
 Isn't Blocking.

19:30.978 --> 19:31.968
  Which Means...

19:31.969 --> 19:34.066
Well, Which Means...

19:35.061 --> 19:36.379
You Keep Using This Set,

19:36.380 --> 19:38.122
And The Circuit Boards
Are Gonna Go,

19:38.190 --> 19:40.790
 And When They Do,
It Won't Be Pretty.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.230
  Well, There Must Be
  Something We Can Do.

19:44.231 --> 19:46.404
Try To Keep The Set
 From Overheating.

19:46.512 --> 19:49.769
But Even If You Do,
It's Just A Matter Of Time,

19:49.896 --> 19:53.485
And Not Much At That.
   I'm Sorry, Pal.

19:56.643 --> 19:58.652
 So You Wanna Go
To The Homecoming Game Together?

19:58.653 --> 20:02.156
   'Cause Obviously, I'm Not
  Bringing Alison This Year.

20:02.611 --> 20:04.421
   Sorry, Pal. I Got A Date.

20:04.597 --> 20:06.879
   Really?
Who's The Lucky Lady?

20:08.348 --> 20:09.677
Janet.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.800
 Mm. Janet Who?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.567
  Janet Meadows.

20:18.661 --> 20:21.953
Janet Meadows
 Is Your Date To Homecoming?

20:22.375 --> 20:23.344
Yep.

20:23.345 --> 20:25.664
As In Sully's Janet Meadows?

20:25.866 --> 20:27.923
"Behind The Bar"
 Janet Meadows?

20:27.924 --> 20:30.170
"Always Gives Me
Extra Blue Cheese Crumble

20:30.171 --> 20:32.451
With My Buffalo Wings"
Janet Meadows?

20:32.530 --> 20:33.687
   The Same.

20:34.023 --> 20:37.094
Wow. How Long
Have You Two Been...

20:38.414 --> 20:39.773
  A Twosome?

20:41.314 --> 20:43.501
Well, We've Been Circling
Around It For A While Now.

20:44.603 --> 20:45.863
  Why?
You Think It's A Mistake?

20:45.864 --> 20:47.877
   Not At All. I Just...

20:48.513 --> 20:50.458
  Thought <I>She</I>
   Had Better Taste.

20:55.014 --> 20:56.855
Tongues Are Gonna Wag.

20:56.918 --> 20:58.037
 So?

20:58.168 --> 21:00.925
  Hate To Think What Everybody's
Saying About <I>Me</I> These Days.

21:01.658 --> 21:03.442
Can't Let That Stuff
 Get To You.

21:03.561 --> 21:05.152
Ah, It's Not Just That.
It's...

21:06.624 --> 21:08.335
Every Girl I've Been With,

21:09.153 --> 21:10.482
  I Knew Why
We Were Gonna Break Up

21:10.483 --> 21:12.379
Two Weeks
Before We Started Dating.

21:12.590 --> 21:13.900
With Janet...

21:15.615 --> 21:16.863
I Don't Know.

21:16.912 --> 21:18.620
Isn't That A Good Thing?

21:20.385 --> 21:21.402
Not If
You're The Kind Of Guy

21:21.403 --> 21:24.527
Who Likes To Break Up Two Weeks
    <I>After</I> You Start Dating.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.574
Some Nice Moves
You Got There.

21:37.147 --> 21:38.561
 <I>What</I> Moves?

21:39.198 --> 21:40.874
   You Know,
Not Faing Off.

21:40.875 --> 21:44.001
 Actually,
  Still Working On That.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.290
Ooh. (Inhales Sharply)
 I'm Breaking It In.

21:46.291 --> 21:48.321
   Just Drove This Board
  Off The Lot Yesterday.

21:48.696 --> 21:52.937
I Didn't Miss
Your Birthday, Did I?
  Nah. One Of
  Big Cat's Peace Offerings.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.182
Big Cat's Been Coming Around
   Bearing Gifts?

21:55.183 --> 21:56.629
You Didn't Hear?

21:57.176 --> 21:58.909
   Big Cat's
  Making A Comeback.

22:00.845 --> 22:02.524
  I Must've Missed
The Press Conference.

22:02.525 --> 22:06.095
   Yeah, Sorry.
  I Was Rootin' For <I>You.</I>

22:06.439 --> 22:07.718
 See You Around.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.041
See You, Sam.

22:11.043 --> 22:12.368
  Be Careful
On That Thing.

22:12.369 --> 22:13.321
   I'll Try.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.762
This Is Your Way
Of Saying Sorry?

22:46.763 --> 22:50.204
Letting Me Watch You
   Buy The Paper?
   There's A Pack Of Gum
  In It For You.

22:50.205 --> 22:52.491
  Also, I Wanted
A Chance To Explain

22:52.492 --> 22:54.351
  Why I Said
What I Said Last Night.

22:54.352 --> 22:57.307
Here You Go, Lotte.
Exact Change For You Today.

22:57.308 --> 22:58.915
Quick Snack?
   Sure.

22:59.952 --> 23:01.164
I Didn't Mean To Hurt
   Your Feelings.

23:01.165 --> 23:03.248
  It's Just--You Know
What Kind Of Guy He Is.

23:03.249 --> 23:07.537
He's Not Just A Player.
 He's The Entire Team.
I Know What Kind
  Of Guy He Is.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.863
  I'm Not Gonna Burn My Tongue
  On These Again, Am I, Joyce?

23:09.864 --> 23:11.859
   We Don't Roast 'Em
   That Hot Anymore, Rooster.

23:11.927 --> 23:13.566
   Not Since
 You Threatened To Sue.

23:13.973 --> 23:15.856
So Why Are You Even
Giving Him The Time Of Day?

23:15.857 --> 23:18.501
   Well, What's Going On With Me
  And Him--It's Different.

23:18.502 --> 23:21.127
 He's Different When
He's With Me.
One More Stop.

23:23.515 --> 23:25.773
   That's What All The Girls
  He's Dated Tell Themselves.

23:25.774 --> 23:27.871
 Th All Think
It's Gonna Be Different.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.248
   Thank You, Susan.

23:29.249 --> 23:32.247
 And, Kaela, Plse Be Careful
With That Bread Slicer.

23:33.101 --> 23:36.102
  Anyway, Look, Janet,
   Here's The Thing.

23:36.316 --> 23:38.340
You Say
You Know His Reputation, But...
  (Door Bells Jingle)

23:38.341 --> 23:41.726
Yeah, I Know His Reputation,
   But People Can Change.

23:41.783 --> 23:43.634
 Rooster, You Used To Be
The Guy Who Owned

23:43.634 --> 23:45.910
 The Largest Ant Farm Collection
In Massachusetts,

23:45.911 --> 23:48.214
But Nobody Calls You
"Captain Arthropod" Anymore.

23:48.215 --> 23:51.064
 Okay, But Did You Notice
Susan And Kaela Back There

23:51.065 --> 23:52.812
In The Bakery?
  Yeah, What About 'Em?

23:52.813 --> 23:54.670
Along With Lotte
At The Newsstand

23:54.671 --> 23:57.645
And Joyce Who Sells Chestnuts,
  That Makes Four--

23:57.797 --> 23:59.587
Four Of Eddie's Conquests.

23:59.588 --> 24:01.133
  And We Haven't Even
Turned Down Main Street.

24:01.134 --> 24:02.671
   That's What
I'm Talking About.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.338
 You Set This Whole Thing Up
Just To Make A Point?

24:06.661 --> 24:08.149
 What Kind Of Person
  Does That?

24:09.272 --> 24:10.605
You Needed To See.

24:10.653 --> 24:12.755
Oh, I See All Right.

24:12.844 --> 24:15.939
   I See One Very Cruel,
 Cruel Man.

24:16.316 --> 24:17.445
Janet...

24:18.189 --> 24:19.823
Janet, Come Back.

24:20.219 --> 24:21.821
Don't You Want Your Gum?

24:22.076 --> 24:24.044
 Wen) Forget About It.
  (Nick) Yes.

24:30.705 --> 24:33.155
  Mm, Either Of You Guys
   Got The Time?

24:33.156 --> 24:35.996
   Mnh-Mnh.
 You Got Somewhere You Gotta Be?

24:35.997 --> 24:38.060
 Yeah,
   I Got The Booster Dinner.
Oh.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.207
   Didn't You Wonder
   Why I Was Wearing A Suit?

24:39.208 --> 24:42.062
  I Did, But I Thought
You Looked So Nice, So...
   (Laughs)

24:43.096 --> 24:45.409
Can You Believe
  Big Cat's Making A Comeback?

24:45.741 --> 24:47.985
   The Guy's Like
The Roger Clemens Of Romance.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.571
  Look, Hannah's A Great Girl
 And All That,

24:50.572 --> 24:54.442
  But You Two Are Past Tense--
  Ancient History Past Tense.

24:54.473 --> 24:56.152
 You Gotta Make
 Your Peace With That.

24:56.416 --> 24:59.159
 It's Too Bad You Dumped Aubrey.
   She Was Hot.

24:59.160 --> 25:03.270
And Very Cool.
Potent Combo.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.000
  You Should Get Aubrey Back.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.600
 You Should Un-Break Up
   With Her.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.100
   No, I'm Not Ready
  To Un-Break Up With Anybody.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.500
 Hey, Maybe She's Ready
To Un-Break Up With You.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.700
Yeah, I Can't Think Of A Better
Way To Get You Over Hannah Jane.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.100
   What Do You Think
 Your Chances Are With Aubrey?

25:23.500 --> 25:24.500
I Don't Know.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.500
  Although She Did Write
 That My Fictional Alter Ego

25:28.500 --> 25:32.200
 Was "A Lover Whose Touch
   Caused Not Just Her Body,

25:32.200 --> 25:34.200
But Her Soul To Quake."
What?! 

25:34.200 --> 25:35.900
She Did?
When Did She Write That?

25:35.900 --> 25:39.300
When Did You Quake Her Soul?
 I Didn't. There Was Never Any Soul Quaking.

25:39.300 --> 25:42.100
Two Kisses Were The Sum Total
  Of Our Relationship.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.200
It's Just A Work Of Fiction--

25:43.200 --> 25:45.700
Something That Sprang Up
   From Aubrey's Imagination.

25:45.700 --> 25:47.400
Well, I Like The Way
 She Thinks.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.300
Me, Too. I Love
Aubrey's Imagination.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.500
  I Would Build--
I Would Build A Summer Home

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
In Her Imagination.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.800
I Would. Honely, I Don't Even Know
If She Wrote That.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.900
That Guy Duncan Bow Probably
Just Made It Up To Get My Goat.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.400
Who's Duncanow?

26:00.400 --> 26:04.200
He's This Teacher That Aubrey
Gave Her Novel To Instead Of Me.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.500
 And I Don't Like Him.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.800
 We Gotta Get That Book.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.600
 We Gotta Break
Into Duncan Bow's Office

26:18.600 --> 26:20.400
 And Read That Book.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.900
 You're Kidding, Right?
No.Nicky, He's Right. 

26:23.900 --> 26:25.100
 He's Right.
 Mm-Hmm.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.600
You--You Read That Book,

26:26.600 --> 26:29.400
You Find Out What Aubrey
 Really Thinks Of You.Mm-Hmm.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
I Don't Wanna Know 
How She Feels About Me.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.900
???? On How To Navigate
 Your Approach.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.500
You Almost Owe It Toer.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.800
Mm-Hmm.She Just Gave It To Duncan Bow
   To Make You Jealous

26:37.800 --> 26:39.800
To Get Your Attention.
You Heard The Dean.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.800
  He's Never Published Anything.
   You've Written A Best Seller.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.900
Yep.I Mean, You Know That She
   Doesn't Really Want His Help.

26:45.900 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, Yeah, So Don't
Do It For Yourself To--

26:49.000 --> 26:51.600
To Satisfy Your Own Curiosity.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.700
Do It For The Sake
  Of The Written Word.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.400
Yes,
For The English Language.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.600
For The Betterment
  Of All Mankind. Yes!

26:58.600 --> 27:01.600
Yes, Yes, Yes.
I'm In.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.200
Looking For A Third.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.200
Yes.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.000
Hey, Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.300
What? What Is It?

27:13.700 --> 27:15.100
 What Are These For?

27:15.400 --> 27:16.800
To Protect Our Identity.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.700
We're Not Wearing
Ski Masks.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.200
Ronnie, Just Give Me
The Screwdriver.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.800
Okay, Fine. Suit Yourselves.

27:27.200 --> 27:27.900
 What?

27:27.900 --> 27:29.300
He's Kling Me.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.500
Looks Like
  A Simple Latch Lock.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.200
  Step Aside.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.600
 Here's How You Open
   A Door.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.500

27:53.900 --> 27:55.400
HI, ??????

27:55.600 --> 27:57.400
You Know, Maybe
This Is A Good Thing.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.200
Maybe This Is What You Need
To Keep You Moving Forward,

28:00.200 --> 28:03.700
Taking More Baby Steps To Free Yourself
Of Your Fearf The Outside.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.100
You Don't Understand.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.500
Well, Then Help Me.
Help Me Understand.

28:08.900 --> 28:09.800
   Okay.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.900
  Okay, So Right Now
   I'm Fine, Right?

28:13.200 --> 28:14.300
 Not A Care.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.400
Still Fine.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.100
 Still Fine.

28:18.700 --> 28:19.900
 Still Fine.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.900
Okay, Now My Heart's
 Starting To Race.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.900
Cold Sweat
  Cleats The Forehead.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.500
Lump In My Throat
   The Size Of A Cantaloupe.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.800
Trouble Breathing.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.500
Chest About To Explode.
Okay, That's Enough.I Understand.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.800
Come Back Inside. Okay.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.400
It's Been
 That Way For Six Years,

28:48.500 --> 28:51.800
And That Whole Time,
Jason Has Been Here With Me.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.700
You Named Your Tv?

28:54.000 --> 28:54.900

28:56.000 --> 28:57.700
 He's My Constant Companion,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.900
My Faithful Window
Onto The World.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.900

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I'll Help You Wash Those.
No that's Okay.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.600

 <I>Lebanese Hezbollah,</I>
 <I>Syrian Proxy...</I>

29:14.800 --> 29:18.700
Who Has Snow Globes,

29:18.700 --> 29:22.000
 And A Bust Of Dante
On Their Desk?

29:22.900 --> 29:24.100
I Don't Know, But I Think

29:24.100 --> 29:27.100
The Hula Dancer's Kind Of Fine.
Shh!

29:34.200 --> 29:35.200

29:35.700 --> 29:37.100
I Was Just Thinkin'...

29:39.200 --> 29:40.800
Ikey Would've Loved This.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.600
Hey, Nick,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.200
How Do We Even Know
That The Book Is In Here?

29:47.400 --> 29:49.700
You Know How We Know?
 'Cause I Just Found It.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.300
I Found The Book.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.800

29:56.100 --> 29:58.700
I've Been Soaking These Puppies

29:58.900 --> 30:00.600
We'll Break 'Em Out
   At Halftime.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.600
Ray Cataldo--The Man Who Invented
The Chewable Screwdriver.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.900
Oh!

30:12.500 --> 30:14.000
This Is Nice...

30:14.800 --> 30:16.100
Being Back Together.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.100
Yeah, It Is.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.000
 You Know,
  I Don't Wanna Go Back.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.500
The Way We've Been
 The Last Three Years...

30:27.500 --> 30:29.600
Tuesday, Thursday,
   Every Other Saturday.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.800
Oh, Okay.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.500
Well,  That's How You Feel,
I Mean, We Can Take It Slow.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900

Easier That Way.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.200

30:46.900 --> 30:48.100
Ray.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.300
Hey, You Remember
That Lilac Bush

30:55.300 --> 30:57.000
You Helped Me Plant
  Last Year?

30:58.300 --> 30:59.700

31:01.100 --> 31:02.700
You Know That Thing's
   Still Blooming?

31:02.700 --> 31:04.100
I Mean, Here We Are
   End Of November,

31:04.100 --> 31:06.600
And My Backyard
   Still Smells Like Spring.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.000
Mm, Global Warming.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Nah, Frost Killed
Everything Else.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.200
  You Know, That Bush...
 It's What We Do.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.400
Here In Knights Ridge,
 We Stay,

31:21.400 --> 31:24.100
We Put Down Roots,
  And We Watch 'Em Grow.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.000
You Know I Love It

31:26.000 --> 31:28.100
   When You Break Out
The Gardening Metaphors.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.200
Will You Marry Me,
 Hannah Jane?

31:42.900 --> 31:43.900
Ray...

31:44.100 --> 31:46.000
It's The Only Way
 I Can Do This.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.000
If We're Gonna
  Get Back Together,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.600
It Has To Be All
  Or Nothing At All.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.200
Ray, It's--
It's Just So Fast.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.300
Hannah, If You Can
  Look Me In The Eye

31:55.300 --> 31:56.600
And Honestly Tell Me That

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
If That Speed Bump Hadn't Moved
  Back Into Town Six Weeks Ago,

32:00.300 --> 32:01.700
That We Wouldn't Be
Picking A Reception Hall

32:01.700 --> 32:05.900
And Hiring A Caterer Right Now,
Then, Okay, I'm Wrong,

32:06.200 --> 32:09.000
 And, Uh, And You Should
  Tell Me "No."

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Uh,

32:23.100 --> 32:25.400
Okay, Okay,
Here I Am. Um...

32:25.500 --> 32:27.600
  "He'd Just Arrived
  From Philadelphia.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.900
His Eyes Were Deep Brown
With A Mischievous Sparkle."

32:31.200 --> 32:32.100
No? Maybe.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.200
"There Was Something
 Irresistible About Him.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.500
"He Had The Confident Air

32:35.500 --> 32:39.100
Of A Man Who Always Gets What He Wants."
Okay, I'm Officially Bored.

32:39.100 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, Can We Get
  To The Soul Aking?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.500
 All Right, All Right.

(Let's Check This Out.)

32:46.100 --> 32:48.400
Okay, Let's Go.
Let's Go. Shh.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.500
W ?????

33:06.600 --> 33:08.100
 I'm An Idiot.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.100
 It's Not That Bad.

33:10.300 --> 33:13.100
  Okay, "Operation:
 Rekindle Aubrey's Interest"

33:13.100 --> 33:14.000
  Can Still Be Salvaged.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
There Never Should've Been
An "Operation:Rekindle Aubrey's Interest."

33:18.100 --> 33:21.400
  The Only Girl Whose Interest
  I Wanted To Rekindle Was Hannah's.

33:21.400 --> 33:26.200
And All This Was Just A Drunken,
  Lame Attempto Forget That.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.800
What Did Aubrey Write
   About You?

33:28.100 --> 33:32.800
"He Had The Confident Air Of A Man
 Who Always Gets What He Wants."

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
If It's Hannah You Want,
 It's Hannah You're Gonna Get.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.100
Well, You Seem To Be Forgetting
 One Very Inconvenient Truth.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.300
She's Not Interested.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.400
Didn't Say
 It Was Gonna Be Easy.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.200
It's Gonna Take
  A Perfect Game Of Long Ball.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.200
Which Means You Gotta
 Play It Cool For A While...

33:49.200 --> 33:51.000
A Long While.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.800
You're Friendly,
   But Not Too Friendly.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.800
Around, But Not Available.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.300
Let Her Do Her Thing With Ray...

33:56.300 --> 33:58.300
Yes, And When Hannah
Finally Realizes

33:58.300 --> 34:00.300
What All Of Us Have Known
 For Forever--

34:00.300 --> 34:02.400

34:58.400 --> 35:00.800
Huh? 
When I Think Of Botched-Up Break-Ins,

35:00.800 --> 35:03.200
My Mind Naturally
 Goes Back To Watergate.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.600
You Heard?
Oh, Ye.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.700
* The Mirrors In The Room
Go Black And Blue *

35:11.700 --> 35:15.900

35:34.700 --> 35:35.900
I'll Go.

  Oh. I Guess.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.000
Me, Too.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.500
So What's Going On?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.300
Okay, Thursday At 2:30--

   Oh.
  Oh. Hi, Sweetheart.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.200
Hi, Dean.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.100
 There Was Nothing
   I Could Do, Nick.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.100
You Broke Into
  A Faculty Member's Office.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.800
The College Has Rules.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.400
So I'm...

36:22.600 --> 36:24.100
Yes, You're Through.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.900
* But How Long
  Do I Have To Pay? *

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
Yeah. Okay.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.100
Great.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.500
What's Going On,
Baby?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.400
You Both Have
 Cats Named Mouse, Huh?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
Yes, We Do.
   Yeah.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.100
Imagine That. Will, Um, Will You
Hold This For A Second?

36:40.100 --> 36:41.200
Sure.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.900
   Excuse Me.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.400
 Hey, Janet.Can I Get A Beer?
 You Know,

36:47.400 --> 36:51.400
Going To The Homecoming Game--
 It's A Bad Idea.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.000
'Cause Here's The Thing.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.700
I'm Not Taxes.
I'm Not The Dentist.

36:56.900 --> 36:58.900
I'm Not Something
 You Get Out Of The Way.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.800
What? I'm Also Not Like The Other
   Girls You've Been With.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.400
I'm Not A Cute Cashier.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.900
I Don't Know H
   To Make Waffle Cones.

37:06.300 --> 37:09.300
I'm Not Another St Along The Eddie Latekka
 Conquest Trail.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.400
I'm Not Perky Like Susan,

37:12.400 --> 37:14.300
 I Don't Bat My Eyes Like Lotte,

37:14.300 --> 37:18.200
  And I Certainly Don't Have
Double "D" Cups Like--

37:33.700 --> 37:34.800
You Know What?

37:35.700 --> 37:38.400
You're Not Like The Other Girls
I Usually Date.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.600
You're Smart

37:41.200 --> 37:44.400
And Funny And Beautiful,
Inside And Out.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.700
 You're Absolutely
Nothing Like Taxes.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.300
* I Don't Think
  It Will Fade Away *

37:56.300 --> 37:57.700
Excuse Me.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.400
* I'll Sit Here
 And Wait Till You Come Home *

38:02.400 --> 38:06.400
* 'Cause I'm A Fool For You
Anyway *

38:09.400 --> 38:12.700
* Yes, I'm A Fool For You
  Anyway... *

38:12.700 --> 38:14.400
I Don't Think I Can Do It.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.700
You Can.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.200
 Look...

38:18.700 --> 38:20.100
I Know
  Jason's Been With You,

38:20.100 --> 38:22.400
  Here By Your Side
For All These Years,

38:22.600 --> 38:25.500
And No One And Nothing
  Is Ever Gonna Replace Hi

38:26.800 --> 38:29.500
  But...
 I'm Not Going Anywhere.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.300
And... Maybe,

38:33.400 --> 38:36.500
 Just Maybe Until You're
Ready To Step Outside...

38:38.000 --> 38:40.100
I Could Be
   Your Window Onto The World...

38:41.700 --> 38:43.600
But A Different Kind
 Of Window,

38:43.600 --> 38:45.300
'Cause Unlike Jason,

38:45.300 --> 38:48.000
I'm Not Gonna Focus On
 The Worst Of What's Out There--

38:48.200 --> 38:50.700
 On The Wars
Or The Natural Disasters

38:51.100 --> 38:52.700
  Or The Violent Crimes.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
I'm Gonna Bring You

38:55.400 --> 38:59.300
The Puddles On Centre Street
After A Thunderstorm,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.400
And The Sun Rising
  Over Crystal Lake,

39:01.400 --> 39:03.700
And The Mcmahons--They've Been
   Married For 50 Years,

39:03.700 --> 39:06.400
And They Still Hold Hands
When They Go For A Walk.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.400
That Sounds Nice.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.800
Oh, And One More Thing
  I'm Gonna Do...

39:15.600 --> 39:19.100
* Fool For You Anyway *

39:22.400 --> 39:24.100
And If You Tell Me
 Jason's Ever Done That,

39:24.100 --> 39:25.800
I Will Run Out Of Here
Screaming.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.400
Okay.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.600
I'm Ready.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.700
  * Well, I Miss You, Honey *

39:41.900 --> 39:45.100
  * A Little More Every Day *

39:48.700 --> 39:50.600
Okay,That Time
 You Startled Me.

39:50.900 --> 39:53.500
 You Broke
Into Professor Bow's Office

39:53.500 --> 39:55.800
To Read My Novel?

39:56.200 --> 39:58.300
 That's... One Way
 Of Putting It.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.100
How Else Would You Put It?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.200
Okay, You Pretty Much
 Nailed It.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.000
 I Guess
It's Kind Of Flattering...

40:05.800 --> 40:07.900
In An Incredibly Stalkersh
Kind Of Way.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.900
   Yeah, Just...

40:09.900 --> 40:11.700
Focus On The Flattering Part.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.500
Oh, I Intend To.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.200
No, That's...

40:18.900 --> 40:20.600
 Not What I Meant.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.000
 * I'm A Fool For You Anyway *

40:28.100 --> 40:31.000
 * I'm A Fool For You Anyway *
Good-Bye, Jason.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
* Fool For You Anyway *

40:38.600 --> 40:40.700
And Thanks For Everything
 You Showed Me.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.300
May You Rest In Peace.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.400
 * My River Of Tears Ran Dry *

40:56.500 --> 41:00.700
* And I Tried To Be So Strong *

41:01.400 --> 41:02.600
Amazing, Right?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.700
* But Grew Weaker
   As Time Went By *

41:04.700 --> 41:06.100
Who Would've Thunk It?

41:08.200 --> 41:09.400
i Asked...

41:09.700 --> 41:13.100
She Said Yes.
* You Know Your Love Left A Mark On Me *

41:14.700 --> 41:18.700
* I Don't Think It Will Fade Away *
Never Underestimate The Charity Of Women.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.000
* I'll Sit Here
 And Wait Till You Come Home *

41:28.400 --> 41:32.100
  * 'Cause I'm A Fool For You
Anyway *

41:35.600 --> 41:38.600
   * A Fool For You Anyway *

41:42.200 --> 41:46.100
 * I'm A Fool For You Anyway *
