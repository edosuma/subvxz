(CHEERING AN D APPLAUSE)

00:20.600 --> 00:24.639
Hello. Hello, everybody,
thank you very much. Thank you.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.599
- A big welcome!
- Nice.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.799
A big welcome.
Thank you and welcome.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.839
Welcome to what is
a veryspecial show,

00:35.960 --> 00:39.839
because it is our Christmas special.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.959
Yeah, and this year
it's a little bit different.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.559
Yeah, because it's
actually the middle of March.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.079
JEREMY: It is.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.959
Right, the main reason it's a little bit
different is because our producers

00:49.080 --> 00:53.439
have told us that we should try our hands
at long-distance lorry-driving.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.959
- Literally, my idea of heaven.
- Yeah.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.239
They told us each to buy a truck
and report with it

01:00.360 --> 01:06.039
to what the BBC calls
the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.519
But everybody else calls it Burma.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.759
(DRUMS AN D BELLS)

01:18.880 --> 01:21.559
JEREMY: The meeting point was
a giant parade ground

01:21.680 --> 01:25.959
in the middle of
the old capital city, Rangoon.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.079
And I was the first to arrive.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.919
(ENGIN E WHEEZES THEN STOPS)

01:40.040 --> 01:41.879
I've bought a stereo.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.439
I have a speaker system here
in the roof,

01:45.560 --> 01:49.319
the passenger seat has been replaced
with a subwoofer,

01:49.440 --> 01:54.719
and there are two amps with
a combined power of 2,300 watts.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.079
And the best thing is,
included in the price was this comb

01:59.200 --> 02:00.319
and...

02:00.440 --> 02:02.839
an entire lorry.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.839
It was built in 1 959...

02:10.960 --> 02:12.239
or 1 976.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.959
People are a bit hazy on that.

02:14.080 --> 02:19.039
What we do know for sure is that
Isuzu made the mud flaps, which is odd,

02:19.160 --> 02:21.519
because it says
"Mitsubishi" on the axles.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.039
- Ooh!

02:24.160 --> 02:26.119
Is that James? It isJames.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.679
Don't really call that a lorry.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.359
JAMES: Morning.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.559
- Van, mate.
- What?

02:39.680 --> 02:41.799
- We had to bring lorries.
- That is a lorry.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.079
It's a van.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.119
Technically it's a crane, actually.
I've bought a crane.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.239
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Look at that.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.799
A crane, two winches,
hydraulic rams, legs...

02:51.920 --> 02:55.839
JAMES: And it had the latest
in hi-tech dashboards.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.799
That's a mess.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.919
Isn't this going to drive
your OCD madness...?

03:01.040 --> 03:04.279
Well, I've put labels on things
corresponding to what I thinkthey do.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.879
Hazards... What's that?
I've got one of those in my lorry.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.839
I've had to put a question mark on it.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.559
Mine is a sports lorry.
Straight six, rear-wheel drive,

03:13.680 --> 03:15.319
twin exhausts.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.599
BMW 325i and this - almost identical.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.119
Banging stereo.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.719
Really?

03:22.840 --> 03:23.999
Seriously.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.719
- You want to hear it?
- Not really. I expect it's quite...

03:37.600 --> 03:39.559
- (BUZZING STOPS)
- Anyway, I'm sure that won't become

03:39.680 --> 03:41.999
annoying at all.
I need to ask you a question.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.599
- What?
- Why are you wearing a tie?

03:43.720 --> 03:45.279
Because I'm a modern lorry-driver,

03:45.400 --> 03:48.039
and modern lorry-drivers
are crisp and sharp.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.959
The days are over
when you simply turned up

03:51.080 --> 03:54.319
with a glove box full of strong
pornography, and egg on your vest.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.199
JEREMY: At this point, Hammond arrived

03:58.320 --> 04:01.879
with a glove box full of strong
pornography, and egg on his vest.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.519
(CLEARS HIS THROAT) What do you think?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.599
JAMES: What is it?
A lorry or a Hindu temple?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.319
This has been extensively modded.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.879
- Has it?
- Not just the visual improvements,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.439
though they are significant -

04:12.560 --> 04:15.999
the lights and the little studdy things,
but note...

04:16.120 --> 04:17.639
JEREMY: Oh, God.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.639
All of that frame arrangement, right,
it's a farm truck.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.639
- JEREMY: Yeah.
- That's so it can accommodate

04:22.760 --> 04:24.039
those low-density big loads.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.479
- Big loads of what?
- Of crops.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.119
What crop? Here?

04:27.240 --> 04:29.719
In Burma?
Home of the Golden Triangle?

04:29.840 --> 04:30.679
Hay.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.879
- No.
- Or turnips.

04:33.000 --> 04:33.959
- No.
- Kale.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.559
No, heroin.
That's all they really grow here.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.719
You've bought a heroin lorry.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.279
Fit a lot of heroin in there,
wouldn't you?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.399
Hammond, this seat...

04:41.520 --> 04:44.199
- Yeah.
- Let's be honest, it's a church pew.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.439
Yeah.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.199
It looks like the sort of railway carriage
that Agatha Christie went about in.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.039
- Let's look at what we've got.
- James has bought a van.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.799
Has he parked it a long way away,
or is it that small?

04:53.920 --> 04:57.599
RICHARD: As we were admiring
the paintwork on Jeremy's lorry,

04:57.720 --> 04:59.079
our challenge arrived.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.279
Hmm.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.479
I'm quite excited, actually,
come to think of it,

05:05.600 --> 05:08.039
cos, I mean, we're here, with these.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.279
"In 1 943, British, Australian
and Dutch prisoners of war

"That's what you're going to do.

"You're going to build a river bridge
which is strong enough

05:28.840 --> 05:31.839
"to support the weight
of your lorries."

05:31.960 --> 05:33.359
I don't know anything about

05:33.480 --> 05:35.439
- bridge-building.
- RICHARD: Builda bridge?!

05:35.560 --> 05:36.959
How big a bridge are we going to
have to build...

05:37.080 --> 05:38.639
How much does yours weigh?

05:38.760 --> 05:41.959
- About 1 ,000 tonnes.
- I'm afraid it gets worse.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.799
You know they said
long-distance lorry-driving?

05:44.920 --> 05:45.959
Yes.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.159
"The only trouble is that you have
to drive to the river in question,

05:49.280 --> 05:51.479
"which is in Thailand."

05:51.600 --> 05:54.199
The River Kwai is not in Thailand.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.479
Yes, it is.
The River Kwai is in Thailand.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.079
- Where's Thailand?
- Is it?

05:57.200 --> 06:00.999
Yeah. I promise you, the River Kwai...
I know everyone thinks it's Burma,

06:01.120 --> 06:02.519
it isn't, it's Thailand.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.039
So we're going to go and build a bridge
over the River Kwai.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.719
Like Alec Guinness.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.239

the journey began.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.239
RICHARD: We are off.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.719
Oh, yeah.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.959
JEREMY: We worked out that the most
sensible way of getting to the river

06:33.080 --> 06:34.799
was to head right across Burma

06:34.920 --> 06:38.599
to its northernmost border-crossing
with Thailand.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.399
On this epic 1 ,200-mile journey,

06:43.520 --> 06:47.079
we would find strange new cities
with no-one in them,

06:47.200 --> 06:50.839

straight out ofJurassic Park,

06:50.960 --> 06:55.039
ford disease-filled rivers
and attend a party

06:55.160 --> 06:58.199
which made the scene
at the end ofApocalypse Now

06:58.320 --> 07:00.279
look like a quiet night in.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.999
And we'd have to do it all
in lorries which,

07:03.120 --> 07:06.719
right at the start,
weren't really working properly.

07:06.840 --> 07:10.159
RICHARD: There are gauges. Nothing works.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.319
Nothing at all. Not one of them.

07:12.440 --> 07:17.679
Not fuel gauge, oil,
oil pressure, charge, vacuum,

Ah! That's not it.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.359
There's no synchromesh
on this gearbox,

07:30.480 --> 07:33.599
so when you go from third to second
or whatever, you have to...

The ride is shocking.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.439
Ugh!

08:02.040 --> 08:04.239
Possibly a bit of play
in the steering.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.839
Let me talk you through my brakes.
Um...they don't really work.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.319
I've got three centimetres of pedal travel
where nothing happens,

08:14.440 --> 08:17.799
and then a millimetre where it all happens
and the wheels lock up.

JAMES: There's no handbrake,
and I'm not being stupid,

there isn't hand one,
there isn't a switch.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.319
JAMES: And on top of
the mechanical problems,

a child, right underneath your lorry.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.599
Pedestrians have no concept of traffic.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.759
None at all.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.679
And there was another issue.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.719
One of the reasons
that driving here is so difficult

09:00.840 --> 09:05.159
is because everybody, as you can see,
has right-hand-drive cars,

09:05.280 --> 09:07.919
but they drive on the right.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.559
And this is because, for 46 years,

09:12.680 --> 09:15.759
Burma was run
by a chap called General Ne Win,

09:15.880 --> 09:18.959
who was a properlunatic.

09:21.200 --> 09:26.439
He was guided mostly either by his dreams
or by his astrologers.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.439
One morning, he woke up and he thought,

09:30.560 --> 09:33.799
"My country is slipping
too far to the left politically,

09:33.920 --> 09:36.919
"so I shall correct this
by forcing everybody

09:37.040 --> 09:40.399
"to drive on the right-hand side
of the road."

This makes life particularly difficult
for bus passengers.

pulled up at the side of the road,

09:49.200 --> 09:52.919

will be getting out into the road

09:53.040 --> 09:55.839

11:58.720 --> 12:01.479
- Put your handbrake on.
- It hasn't got a handbrake.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.879
What do you mean,
it hasn't got a handbrake?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.359
It hasn't got a handbrake.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.279
JEREMY: We were causing chaos.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.559
It's broken.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.359
Whoa! What was that?!

12:26.480 --> 12:30.759
James, I've got a headache!
I've never concentrated this hard!

12:33.760 --> 12:34.679
JEREMY: Sorry.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.879
JAMES: I don't think
it'll go through there, mate.

Ohh!

12:39.720 --> 12:42.199
RICHARD: Sorry.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.399
Sorry.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.479
Still, the good news is,
we've done two miles.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.919
Mercifully, we eventually broke free
from the narrow streets.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.919
I'm in agony.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.399

That's reverse.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.759
That was third... Oh... Oh!

13:09.880 --> 13:11.119
Hang on a minute.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.719
If I engage the low range,
then I can put it in third gear

13:15.840 --> 13:17.879
and basically leave it there all day.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.599
A-ha! How brilliant is this?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.039
Oh, yeah.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.279
No more gear-263changing.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.199
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

13:31.800 --> 13:33.799
That doesn't feel very low range to me.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.639
What is it
if it isn't a low-range gearbox?

13:53.920 --> 13:55.999
My truck has split in half.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.239
JAMES: After I had explained to Jeremy
that he'd bought a tipper lorry,

14:04.360 --> 14:08.239
I then had to deal with
CW McCall on the CB radio.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.519
RICHARD: Hey, James.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.239
Hello.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.639
I've got it.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.159
You've got it?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.279
Yeah, my handle.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.159
I'm going to be called Fighting Peacock.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.239
Can I just abbreviate that to Cock?

14:23.360 --> 14:25.439
What are you going to be?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.919
I thought I'd be James,
because that's my name.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.719
Fighting Peacock!

14:32.920 --> 14:35.079
JEREMY: On the outskirts of Rangoon,

14:35.200 --> 14:39.839
we came across a memorial
to the 27,000 Commonwealth soldiers

14:39.960 --> 14:42.599
who died here in the Second World War.

14:45.520 --> 14:49.079
It was a timely reminder
thatThe Bridge On The River Kwai

14:49.200 --> 14:52.279
was rather more than
a Sunday afternoon movie.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.079
"The Japanese sergeant moved
into position, lifted his pick handle

14:59.200 --> 15:02.439
"and delivered a blow across Smith's back
that would have laid out a bull.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.919
"All the thugs now set to in earnest.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.079
"Soon, little could be seen
but the rise and fall of pick helves

15:08.200 --> 15:11.319
"above the heads of the group,
and there were sickening thuds

15:11.440 --> 15:13.719
"as blows went home
on the squirming, kicking body,

15:13.840 --> 15:18.079
"periodically pulled back onto its feet,
only to be knocked down again.

"Bill Smith cried out repeatedly
that he was 50 years of age,

15:21.840 --> 15:23.999
"appealing for mercy, but to no avail..."

15:29.560 --> 15:30.759
The tragedy is...

15:32.240 --> 15:37.319
...that all of those 27,000 men died
fighting for the liberation of Burma

15:37.440 --> 15:39.759
and, straight after the war,
Britain got rid of it

15:39.880 --> 15:44.559
and then it fell into the hands
of a tinpot dictator and Mystic Meg.

15:47.160 --> 15:52.239
JEREMY: With James still map-reading,
we headed out into the countryside,

15:52.360 --> 15:56.119
where we hoped the driving
would be less stressful.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.559
That's my first lock-up,
total lock-up.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.959
I've lost second gear.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.239
There it is.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.639
Jeremy, that bus overtaking you, he's mad.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.559
(HORNS HONK INCESSANTLY)

16:19.680 --> 16:22.359
Look, I can't...
I'm trying to change gear.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.039
The miles and the hours rolled by.

16:38.080 --> 16:43.759
Ow!

16:45.120 --> 16:48.959

for God's sake.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.239
That's better.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.759
JAMES: That is the going down of the sun.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.839
It's fabulous. Look at that.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.319
JAMES: However, when the sun
had finished going down,

17:25.440 --> 17:27.799
things weren't so fabulous.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.319
That girl on that bike,
she's just invisible.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.039
JEREMY: There's a moped there
with no lights on

17:41.160 --> 17:42.919
and a bicycle there
with no lights on,

17:43.040 --> 17:46.959
and I can't really see them
because my headlights are...

17:47.080 --> 17:49.559
well, they're glow-worms in jam jars.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.759
Can you see anything, Hammond?

17:54.520 --> 17:55.919
RICHARD: Not a thing.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.439
Literally, just my own stupid reflection
in my windscreen.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.279
JEREMY: Jeez!

18:05.600 --> 18:08.599
I'm so frightened of
running over a pedestrian,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.279
I'm not even worried
about my knee any more.

(HORN HONKS)

18:15.880 --> 18:16.919
JAMES: Whoa!

18:19.160 --> 18:21.359
The local attitude to headlights
would appear to be...

18:22.400 --> 18:25.359
...full beam or off.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.999
JEREMY: There you go.
A lorry with one central head lamp.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.679
So you think it's a motorbike
until the last second,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.119
and then, no, it's a massive truck!

18:45.320 --> 18:47.239
(YAWNS) I'm bloody tired.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.759
We've now been driving today
for exactly 1 2 hours.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.879
That would be illegal in Britain.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.399
But we are now very close
to the overnight hotel.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.079

This is like a truckers' place.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.479
JEREMY: Are we staying here?

19:25.600 --> 19:29.039
The producers said yes,
and that our room was upstairs.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.119
Oh, it's not so bad.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.559
JEREMY: Is it not so bad?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.679
Yeah.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.959
Oh, God.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.199
Worst night's sleep in history.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.079
It wasn't sleep.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.599

20:10.680 --> 20:12.399

(ENGINE SPLUTTERS NOISILY INTO LIFE)

20:15.320 --> 20:16.479
That.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.839
But look what I've done.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.839
What have you done?

20:20.960 --> 20:25.959
It's a leg brace so I can change gear.
So it supports my knee.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.959
Let's go.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.839
- I think we just move on, erase it...
- I want to leave.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.279
You know those Ice Road Truckers?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.359
They're always going,
"We got a real tough job."

20:36.480 --> 20:37.919
They can shut up.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.279
Cos I don't suspect
that the Ice Road Truckers

20:40.400 --> 20:42.679
have to sleep...like this chap here.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.759
Look at him.

20:47.960 --> 20:52.479
JEREMY: Before leaving, I checked the map
to see how far we'd come.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.119
- No.
- No?

20:55.360 --> 20:56.679
Here?

20:56.800 --> 20:58.439
Are you sure?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.319
It's here?

21:06.040 --> 21:07.439
Show me.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.159
Hammond?

21:11.480 --> 21:12.879
This is where we began.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.679
We're heading for here,
up here, around here.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.759
So where do you think we are, then,
on this road?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.239
No.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.359
We're here.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.159
You know that fork when we left Rangoon
and James went left?

21:31.280 --> 21:37.159
All of yesterday we drove up here.
What was it, 1 4, 1 5 hours?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.319
- JAMES: Yeah, but...
- JEREMY: You're on the way to Bangladesh.

21:40.480 --> 21:45.559
James suggested we go all the way
back to Rangoon and start again

21:45.680 --> 21:47.439
but I fired him as navigator

21:47.560 --> 21:52.319
and said we should take a small road
over the hills to get back on course.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.039
This would mean driving
deep into the sticks.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.079
There seems to be a tradition here
for riding on a lorry

22:07.200 --> 22:08.559
rather than necessarily in it.

22:08.680 --> 22:13.999
I've just seen three or four blokes
on the top of the cab of a lorry.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.599
So if he brakes suddenly...

22:18.480 --> 22:20.279
...they all get run over, I suppose.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.359
The maizey-coloured granular stuff
at the side of the road

22:24.480 --> 22:27.519
is rice being dried out, apparently.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.319
RICHARD: Traffic...

22:30.440 --> 22:33.879
just drives past and has no compunction
aboutjust driving through it all.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.879
And nobody gets cross.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.279
It obviously happens all the time.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.439
Look at that. That bike here
is driving through all the rice.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.199
(HORN HONKS)

22:47.440 --> 22:50.839
RICHARD: Also, the fuel stations
weren't exactly cutting edge

22:50.960 --> 22:53.519
and there wasn't a lot to go round.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.519
Is this it?

23:01.400 --> 23:02.519
Finished?

23:02.640 --> 23:04.039
No more?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.199
So there's no diesel?

23:07.320 --> 23:08.239
Yes.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.439
They had one...two-and-a-half litres...

23:13.840 --> 23:16.439
- Right.
- ...which is now in the sports lorry.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.799
I've been a bit selfish.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.799
So you've put all the diesel available
in your lorry?

23:19.920 --> 23:20.919
Yes.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.799
If we were on a raft
and had three biscuits...

23:24.920 --> 23:26.679
Mm-hm. I may as well have them.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.159
JAMES: Still, could be worse.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.919
Urgh!

23:39.840 --> 23:43.039
I'm not a young man
and I'm not a fit man, I'll be honest.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.239
And I am suffering in here.
This ride is really brutal.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.839
The problem is that the sports lorry
was designed to work for a living,

23:51.960 --> 23:56.199
it was designed to have five or six tonnes
of stuff in the back.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.439
Without that weight,
it's just bouncing all over the place.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.879
Obviously, I didn't want
to admit this to my colleagues,

24:05.000 --> 24:10.959
so when we stopped for tea
I tried discreetly to rectify the problem.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.159
- isn't he?
- Oh, I see.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.439
He's going to need a lot of bricks.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.759
JEREMY: Having come
to the same conclusion,

24:29.880 --> 24:33.599
I decided to borrow
James's complicated crane.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.039
I can't stand watching this.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.639
Right.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.039
What the hell's happening?!

25:06.160 --> 25:07.879

25:10.120 --> 25:11.999
I think you've actually caught
your own lorry.

25:12.120 --> 25:15.559
Stop! Help! My knee! Ow!

25:18.960 --> 25:20.319

25:23.400 --> 25:27.519
JAMES: Oh, dear. Stop! Put it down!

25:27.640 --> 25:31.319
You'll break the jib off the crane.
And you've knackered my lorry.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.959
JEREMY: Well, I've just saved the day
by tipping my lorry up.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.159
The bricks have fallen out
and the handbrake's not on.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.199
RICHARD: What have you done?!

25:39.320 --> 25:41.479
It is on.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.279
At this point,
I opted for a less hi-tech solution.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.359
I'm going to see
if they've got any of those...

25:52.480 --> 25:55.079
What are those nuts called
that they eat together, the stimulants?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.719
- Betel nut.
- Betel nut?

25:56.840 --> 25:58.799
- Betel nut. Yeah, it makes you...
- What's that in Burmese?

25:58.920 --> 25:59.839
Betel nut.

- Is it?
- I think so.

- I bet it isn't.
- Orjust betel.

- Or nut.
- I hope he comes back with a beetle.

It's a mild stimulant
garnished with cricket.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.879

26:23.000 --> 26:25.079
Mm. For hours and hours.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.359
And then what?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.279
I don't feel it. I'm not getting the buzz.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.799

they've put a pebble.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.639
I'm just smashing my teeth up.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.439
- Is yours just a pebble?
- Mm.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.879
RICHARD: I'm getting nothing.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.599
Can't we just sniff glue?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.319
- It'd be a lot nicer.
- RICHARD: They're bound to sell it.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.519
- Have they got crystal meth?
- JAMES: Probably.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.599
- I'd rather break bad than eat this.
- I think you'll find

27:04.720 --> 27:07.679
- some heroin in the back of my truck.
- Oh, I'm getting some chilli.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.079
I've got nothing.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.399
(THEY SPIT)

27:18.520 --> 27:20.999
Oh, shit! Got it down my tie.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.959
- You spit it out, but...
- I bet this isn't nice television, is it?

27:25.080 --> 27:27.879
(MUFFLED) It glues your mouth up,
have you noticed?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.559
It completely glues it up.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.719
Oh, yeah, look, the red gob.
I've seen that coming out of people.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.159
- (GARBLES)
- What?

27:39.280 --> 27:42.079
(GARBLES INCOHERENTLY)

27:46.920 --> 27:50.239
RICHARD: We decided to skip dessert
and got back on the road

27:50.360 --> 27:56.239
where, with a tonne of bricks in the back,
Jeremy's sports lorry was now transformed.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.639
It... I mean, it's not perfect,
but it's a hell of a lot better.

28:02.280 --> 28:06.319
If I put more weight in,
it'll be even more comfortable.

28:07.400 --> 28:13.079
So, at the next village, I bought
some of the region's special seeds.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.159
RICHARD: What's he doing?

28:17.120 --> 28:18.919
He thinks he's bought some heroin.

28:19.040 --> 28:19.959
- I have.
- Has he?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.639
I have bought heroin.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.679
It's rice.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.399
- It isn't rice.
- It is rice.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.439
Richard Hammond - trust me on this -
on the streets of London,

28:30.560 --> 28:33.119
this has a value of £1 2 million.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.359
No, mate...

28:38.480 --> 28:41.239
on the shelves of Tesco,
that has a value of about a fiver.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.479
It's not rice!

28:42.600 --> 28:44.959
Are you going to cut it with peas?

28:45.080 --> 28:46.999
(LAUGHS)

28:48.880 --> 28:53.919
JEREMY: With the heroin loaded,
I found a heavy old tree stump

28:54.040 --> 28:57.119
and asked James
to crane it on board as well.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.359
He is so unbelievably happy.

29:03.720 --> 29:08.399
JEREMY: With the sports lorry
fully loaded, it was transformed.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.079
Oh, yeah!

29:11.160 --> 29:15.879
First bump, I shan't even feel it
because the ride is sublime.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.879
The ride of a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.639
However, on the hills,
there was a bit of a downside.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.279
Hello, James and Richard?

29:29.400 --> 29:30.559
What?

29:32.600 --> 29:34.239
This is my new top speed.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.239
RICHARD: Oh, God, I thought
we were stuck behind a moped.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.279
I couldn't see. Is this it?

29:39.400 --> 29:41.119
Yes.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.319
JAMES: You're a right dipstick.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.599
Yes.

29:47.680 --> 29:52.439
JAMES: And because the road was so narrow,
we couldn't get past him.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.919
JEREMY: Uh-oh!

29:54.960 --> 29:57.119
Steep gradient. Agh!

30:00.560 --> 30:01.599
Foot hard down.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.079
Dearie me, we're in trouble here.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.759
RICHARD: Oh, this is ridiculous!
We're hardly moving.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.599
(ENGINE REVS THEN STOPS)

30:19.720 --> 30:21.039
No, we've had it.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.559
You're going to have to back up.
I need a run-up for this bit.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.199
What?!

30:26.320 --> 30:28.519
It won't go up this hill.
You're going to have to back up.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.639
RICHARD: No, this hill has gone on
for about a mile through hairpins.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.159
- I'm not reversing back down...
- James, could you explain

30:34.280 --> 30:38.439
the situation to him? I can't go forwards.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.159
- I can't back up either.
- Look, it's your fault.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.639
- A, Hammond's in the way...
- I'm not reversing it.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.759
- ...and B, I can't be bothered.
- Bloody dangerous, apart from anything.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.639
It's round bends,
there's people on bikes. No.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.239
Well, there's only one thing for it, then.
I have to lose weight.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.359
- (MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
- Oh-h-h, no.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.959
Er, no! Jeremy, that's not...

31:01.080 --> 31:02.079
That's not the...

31:12.720 --> 31:14.479
JAMES: You are a complete child.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.279
A petulant child.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.319
You wanted me to move out of your way.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.879
I am now able to move out of your way.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.159
Look at this. Yes!

31:39.040 --> 31:43.119
This lorry is now scampering
up these hills.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.639
Right. Well...

31:52.760 --> 31:55.319
One, two...

32:02.400 --> 32:06.199
JEREMY: Stopping to mend my tailgate
allowed the others to catch up

32:06.320 --> 32:09.439
and, when they did,
they weren't in the best of moods.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.319
RICHARD: I've got a new handle for you
on the CB.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.279
It's called Selfish... (BLEEP)

32:17.360 --> 32:20.039
JEREMY: And things didn't improve
a few miles later

32:20.160 --> 32:23.999
when the hill route I'd selected
went a bit wrong.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.519
JAMES: Your road is sort of not a road,
is it? Let's be honest.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.839
JEREMY: It's not really a road here
at all. We've got a ford.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.719
It's a ford or...a river.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.999
JAMES: Yeah. Well, what do we think?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.319
We have to ford the river.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.239
Swim it? Look at it!

32:41.360 --> 32:43.159
We could build a bridge
and get some practice in.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.199
JAMES: Don't be ridiculous.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.239
JEREMY: Or we could build a car ferry.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.439
RICHARD: No.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.479
JAMES: There's your wood.
RICHARD: There's a start. There you go.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.519
RICHARD: If you go on first...

32:50.640 --> 32:53.119
JEREMY: Right, well, look, my engine...

32:54.360 --> 32:55.359
...there.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.479
If the water is deeper than my...

33:00.720 --> 33:01.919
...hips...

33:02.040 --> 33:04.199
Your penis, is what you want to say.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.919
There, halfway down my penis.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.359
So now you've got to crayon
a mark on your penis.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.519
I know where my penis is!

33:10.640 --> 33:15.839
And if the water goes above halfway up
my penis, it's too deep for my lorry.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.119
Where's yours?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.679
- Nipples.
- Nipples.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.359
- Yeah.
- Is it?

33:24.480 --> 33:25.599
James, what are you, knees?

33:25.720 --> 33:28.679
- What, it's actually about there.
- (LAUGHTER)

33:28.800 --> 33:33.479
RICHARD: With the science sorted out,
we waded in for a recce.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.519
JAMES: This is...
I'm already in trouble here.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.679
I'm all right.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.919
My sports lorry is still working here.

33:41.040 --> 33:44.559
My nipple alarm is going off, very nearly.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.039
Yeah, now, this bit
we need to stay away from.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.559
RICHARD: Yeah, that is...

33:49.680 --> 33:51.439
- Solid rock.
- It's icy.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.479
This is solid rock I'm on.

33:54.560 --> 33:58.999
RICHARD: With our recce complete,
Jeremy headed across first.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.719
JEREMY: Here we go, into the water.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.639
Lots of wheel spin, sliding badly.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.518
Oh, yes.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.599
The sports lorry is clear, it's through.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.958
It's time for the smug face.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.079
Mr Slowly went next...in his van.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.199
That's quite clunky.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.879
It's... There's something stuck there.
I can feel it.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.319
We'll break the front axle off.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.839
JEREMY: Hammond immediately
rushed to May's aid.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.599
Ramming.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.999
JAMES: Stop!

35:06.800 --> 35:09.359
JEREMY: James then tried
to winch himself off

35:09.480 --> 35:12.319
using Hammond's truck as a ground anchor.

35:13.400 --> 35:17.319
Ted Nugent and George Michael
are helping one another out.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.759
After this failed,
I tried to tow him clear.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.079
Three, two, one, now.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.199
But that didn't work either.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.559
JAMES: Stop!

35:32.680 --> 35:35.239
JEREMY: He then decided to use his crane,

35:35.360 --> 35:37.399
which immediately broke.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.199
He really was stuck, so we were forced
to take drastic action.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.759
Hammond and I have had
a bit of a chat and we are...

35:51.880 --> 35:53.999
Well, we're leaving him.

35:54.120 --> 35:59.039
He has bought a van
that has no traction at all,

35:59.160 --> 36:01.159
no ability to work off road

36:01.280 --> 36:04.919
and now no hydraulics,
so none of his tools work.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.599
You've got to be ruthless
in these circumstances.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.279
With his crane, he was useful.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.879
Without it,
he's just another mouth to feed.

36:14.280 --> 36:19.759
JEREMY: I settled in for another stint
with the world's most cooperative gearbox.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.039
Oh, bollocks, missed again.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.599
(CRUNCHING)

36:23.720 --> 36:24.919
Nothing there.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.159
Nothing there, there it is.

36:27.280 --> 36:32.239
Mind you, on these twisty roads,
life was even worse for Hammond.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.839
This is really annoying.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.519
Still, at least I was moving.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.719
JAMES: The situation report.
I've been rescued

36:47.840 --> 36:51.119
by a very helpful local man with
his truck - I still don't know his name -

36:51.240 --> 36:53.039
and he's lent me this arc welder

36:53.160 --> 36:56.439
to repair the shaft that drives the pump
that makes the crane work.

37:00.200 --> 37:04.719
With that done, my fellow knight of
the road towed me back to firmer ground.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.239
And then we're free.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.799
I must remember to say
a thousand chei-zu-boos to this man.

37:16.600 --> 37:22.119
RICHARD: Miles ahead, in the advanced
party, we were really starting to climb.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.239
Oh-ho-ho!

37:24.360 --> 37:26.519
Wow!

37:28.440 --> 37:30.919
The views were stunning.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.799
And at the top of the hill,
we pulled over for a bit of a look.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.879
JEREMY: You know we always say
that Italy is God's racetrack,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.519
Canada is his pantry,
Germany is his workshop?

37:50.920 --> 37:52.439
That's his garden.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.959
RICHARD: Absolutely staggering.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.639
Captain Traction would have enjoyed
this view very much.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.719
However...

38:10.480 --> 38:11.839
Bollocks.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.279
(ENGINE STRUGGLES)

38:22.360 --> 38:26.399
The local bloke with the digger
is giving me a little leg up there.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.319
(TOOTS HORN)

38:31.440 --> 38:35.319
It's great, isn't it?
This must be Buddhism in action.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.679
I might convert...

38:37.800 --> 38:40.039
from whatever I already am.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.319
JEREMY: Very, very farahead,
Hammond and I had finally found the road

38:45.440 --> 38:48.639
we should have been on in the first place.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.279
RICHARD: Put it in top gear.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.039
- There it is. Oh, yeah.
- (ENGINE STRUGGLES)

39:07.160 --> 39:09.079
That sounds terrible.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.119
It's like being back in Spain!
Nothing on it!

39:17.880 --> 39:20.079
JEREMY: Regrouped, we continued onwards.

39:20.200 --> 39:26.399
Our destination, Burma's brand-new
capital city, Naypyidaw.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.119
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

39:34.240 --> 39:39.359
Here, the producers had once again
lined up a hovel for us to stay in.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.839
But we were hot, filthy
and worn out.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.799
So we ignored them and headed
for the best hotel in town.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.159
JAMES: A flushing lavatory.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.639
Oh, rest my weary head.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.519
Having first filled it with gin.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.999
- (SPATTERING ON CAB ROOF)
- Oh, listen to that rain.

40:03.120 --> 40:07.279
Oh, it'll be like the shower
I shall be having in 30 seconds.

40:08.720 --> 40:12.279
JEREMY: Our only problem was
that two of us

40:12.400 --> 40:14.759
weren't exactly dressed
for a place like this.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.199
- Let me do the talking.
- Good evening, sir.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.799
Evening, sir.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.919
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

40:21.040 --> 40:25.359
- Three rooms, please.
- Sorry, we have no more rooms, sir.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.719
Fully booked.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.759
Sorry, sir.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.039
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

40:48.040 --> 40:51.159
JEREMY: The next morning,
after another dreadful night,

40:51.280 --> 40:55.839
we decided enough was enough
and agreed we should modify our lorries

40:55.960 --> 41:00.239
to make them more suitable
for our travels through Burma.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.159
Um, I'm making a house.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.879
So, I need ornaments, like a vase.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.719
No, no, no.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.799
Ah-haaa!

41:19.120 --> 41:21.279
Aww, a pistol grip.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.839
(BLOWS)

41:24.960 --> 41:27.279
Lie...no!

41:27.400 --> 41:29.319
- (SPEAKS IN DIALECT)
- So, that's like lie...

41:29.440 --> 41:31.639
- (SPEAKS IN DIALECT)
- Mmm.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.159
- Mingalaba.
- Mingalaba.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.639
Are these yours?

41:37.920 --> 41:40.199
No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Sorry.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.319
This.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.999
If you imagine an elephant, eleph...
Uuurrrrgh!

41:46.120 --> 41:48.079
- That's the fellow.
- Elephant?

41:48.200 --> 41:49.239
- Elephant?
- Yeah.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.599
- This...
- Yeah, but small,

41:50.720 --> 41:52.479
so it can go on a table.
So, it's like a table.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.799
- Go away. Go away!
- Go away?

42:05.480 --> 42:07.559
Now we're getting somewhere.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.479
What bore is that?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.559
This...

42:15.680 --> 42:17.439
...times eight.

42:17.560 --> 42:22.279
First, I need one for a kitchen,

42:22.400 --> 42:23.919
where you...

42:24.040 --> 42:26.639
- Kitchen?
- (POPS) ...cook and

42:26.760 --> 42:28.239
make a cup of tea.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.919
- (SLURPS AND GOBBLES)
- (LAUGHS)

42:30.040 --> 42:30.959
In the kitchen. Yeah?

42:31.080 --> 42:32.399
- Yes.
- Kitchen.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.679
I don't want a cup-holder that badly!

42:41.800 --> 42:47.319
800? That's...that's about 50 pence.
Is that right?!

42:47.440 --> 42:50.719
Oh, no, it's not long enough.
She's misunderstood me.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.879
That's all right,
we'll get some more from somewhere else.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.039
(LAUGHS) It's...it's just
the best look you've ever seen!

43:00.160 --> 43:03.039
- (LAUGHS)
- (CHILD LAUGHS)

43:03.160 --> 43:06.519
It's a child catapult! It's good!
Do it again!

43:06.640 --> 43:11.559
Doing! Here we go! Ready? And... And...

43:11.680 --> 43:13.039
(GIGGLES)

43:13.160 --> 43:14.559
Go!

43:15.760 --> 43:19.599
Apparently, he once got clean to the end
of that corridor! That's brilliant!

43:23.760 --> 43:27.199
RICHARD: With the shopping complete,
we found a workshop,

43:27.320 --> 43:30.799
hired some local help,
toiled through the night,

43:30.920 --> 43:33.199
and the next morning,

43:33.320 --> 43:34.759
the job was done.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.319
Every modification I have made

43:42.440 --> 43:46.159
is inspired by my desire
not to run over any of the locals.

43:46.280 --> 43:49.599
So it has, for example,
Buddha looking down,

43:49.720 --> 43:53.559
a lucky elephant, the lucky owl which is
very important. It has better mirrors,

43:53.680 --> 43:55.799
better lights and it's wearing
a high-visibilityjacket.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.759
Yes, as are you.
What is the boiler in the back?

43:58.880 --> 44:01.839
- RICHARD: Are you brewing beer?
- What? No, sadly.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.599
It's the water tank
for the brake-cooling system.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.399
- What, like racing lorries have?
- Exactly like that.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.079
It sprays. I've got a little switch
in the cab.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.679
It sprays water on the drums,
makes them more efficient downhill.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.319
- I didn't think of that.
- No.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.199
- What's the box?
- Air conditioning.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.439
- What's that got to do with safety?
- Keeps me alert.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.559
- Does it?
- Yes.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.599
And keeps him alert as well.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.519
- Because he'll want to break it.
- Yes.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.319
JAMES: Jeremy then showed ushis work.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.639
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

44:29.800 --> 44:32.239
Why would you not have...

44:32.360 --> 44:33.879
a convertible lorry?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.679
- Cos it's raining.
- Look at it!

44:36.800 --> 44:38.039
It's... It's quite good, actually.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.239
- Smashing.
- It's very good. Shelby striping.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.279
- Yeah.
- Sports badging on the side.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.559
Living accommodation on the back.
This is fashioned from lead and rhodium.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.679
- Is it?
- Yes, for extra weight

44:48.800 --> 44:51.359
to improve my ride. Come back.

44:51.480 --> 44:55.199
Simple, crisp accommodation inside,

44:55.320 --> 44:56.839
Shelby bedding

44:56.960 --> 44:59.519
and ebony wood floor.
That's more weight.

44:59.640 --> 45:00.999
Come on!

45:01.120 --> 45:02.519
It looks brilliant!

45:02.640 --> 45:06.439
JAMES: As, it must be said,
did Hammond's.

45:06.560 --> 45:09.079
- JEREMY: Hammond, you've got white walls!
- RICHARD: Oh, yeah, yeah!

45:09.200 --> 45:12.319
- The ugly duckling has become a swan.
- Wow!

45:12.440 --> 45:14.919
Yeah! Check out my stacks.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.799
- Please don't tell me they're exhausts.
- Yeah. Both sides.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.839
- What, actually func...? They are.
- Yeah, there's a T-junction.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.639
Hang on, you've made it even taller.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.719
I have. It's bigger, isn't it?
It's better.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.359
But come round the back,
this... Honestly.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.639
He did a little skip then.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.359
- He's very excited.
- He did a skip.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.319
I am very, very... What I have here,

45:34.440 --> 45:36.399
this is the bathroom area.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.759
- Yeah.
- Shower.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.439
- It's got a shower!
- Where's the water come from? Ha-ha!

45:41.560 --> 45:42.559
Ha-ha, yourself.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.599
There is, up the top, a reservoir.
About so big.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.119
On my viewing gallery.

45:47.240 --> 45:50.799
Hammond, it's a bucket.
It's... It's a bucket.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.319
It's a remote reservoir.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.279
And that is, right now,

45:54.400 --> 45:57.679
collecting beautiful, crisp, clean,
fresh, invigorating rainwater.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.119
This is the kitchen area,
with lino to reflect that.

46:00.240 --> 46:01.799
- What's that?
- Over there is a wardrobe.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.599
There is a hammock with mosquito net
built in. Drinks globe on the right.

46:05.720 --> 46:08.599
JEREMY: And Hammond wasn't finished.

46:08.720 --> 46:11.999
From up here, on a sunny evening,
I can sit here as the sun goes down,

46:12.120 --> 46:15.399
gaze at the stars and enjoy a drink
from my drinks globe.

46:15.520 --> 46:16.959
Do you take visitors?

46:17.080 --> 46:18.919
- Yeah...
- I think he's going to have to,

46:19.040 --> 46:20.959
- because something's just occurred to me.
- What?

46:21.080 --> 46:23.399
You haven't got
any living accommodation.

46:23.520 --> 46:26.039
That's a very good point.
You've forgotten it, you idiot!

46:26.160 --> 46:27.799
No, I haven't!

46:29.920 --> 46:31.799
- JEREMY: Well, you have.
- RICHARD: Are you sleeping in the cab?

46:31.920 --> 46:33.519
Because it's not going to be comfortable.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.999
- Let's see.
- Oh, my God!

46:36.120 --> 46:39.679
JEREMY: Before we set off,
I gave the chaps some presents.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.519
- You bought us a teddy bear?!
- No, that's for me.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.359
- Is it?
- Yeah, that's my bonnet ornament.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.919
Are you feeling lonely? It's your what?

46:46.040 --> 46:49.719
Bonnet ornament for weight.
It's the heaviest teddy bear in Burma.

46:49.840 --> 46:53.639
I'd got Hammond
a bonnet ornament too.

46:53.760 --> 46:57.199
- RICHARD: Oh!
- JAMES: Wow, that's beautiful.

46:57.320 --> 46:59.239
I know you don't have a clock
so you'll have it on the bonnet,

46:59.360 --> 47:01.599
you'll be able to tell the time.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.439
- Oh, it really is...
- It's a high-quality gift.

47:05.640 --> 47:09.319
Oh, fantastic! Thank you. I've always
wanted a Shuanglin hammer.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.759
It's from my own personal collection.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.719
JEREMY: Having christened my bear
Rudyard

47:16.840 --> 47:20.439
and attached him to the sports lorry,
we set off.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.519
Oh, this feels better already.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.159
Oh, hang on.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.999
Whoa!

47:29.120 --> 47:32.759
Richard Hammond is doing
a remake of The Poseidon Adventure.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.119
JEREMY: We had many miles to cover,

47:37.240 --> 47:41.359
but first we had to get through
Naypyidaw's morning rush hour.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.959
This rush-hour traffic's
not as bad as I thought.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.839
The roads were completely empty.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.679
And massive.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.839
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

48:11.960 --> 48:14.399
Yep, 1 6 lanes now.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.159
(LAUGHS)

48:17.280 --> 48:20.239
Wait, it's gone bigger.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.919
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

48:23.040 --> 48:23.959
20!

48:24.080 --> 48:25.959
It's 20 lanes now!

48:27.440 --> 48:32.679
This may look stupid and pointless,
but actually it really isn't.

48:32.800 --> 48:36.359
The problem with most cities
is that the growth comes

48:36.480 --> 48:38.639
and the city simply
can't accommodate it.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.039
That happened in London, Rome,
Paris, Bangkok, everywhere.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.999
That is notgoing to happen here.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.239
I think this must be the first city built

48:48.360 --> 48:51.199
entirely in anticipation of the future.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.079
JEREMY: But the future hasn't arrived yet.

48:58.920 --> 49:03.959
So, for now, the whole place is
almost completely deserted.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.719
Even here, in the shadow
of the parliament building,

49:10.840 --> 49:15.719
we were able to have a game of football
in the middle of the road!

49:15.840 --> 49:17.039
Officer!

49:19.720 --> 49:22.159
JEREMY: It's the Burmese police
versus Top Gear.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.799
- Oh, no!
- Rush hour, game over!

49:24.920 --> 49:26.239
Look at it! Traffic!

49:26.360 --> 49:29.399
JEREMY: Really, though,
it was too wet for football.

49:29.520 --> 49:34.599
So, much to Hammond's annoyance,
we organised a city-centre drag race.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.359
(ENGINES REV)

49:37.960 --> 49:40.679
This doesn't seem fair.

49:40.800 --> 49:45.479
I've got the same 6.4-litre Isuzu
straight-six diesel as Jeremy's

49:45.600 --> 49:50.439
and probablyJames's,
but the lumber bus is bigger!

49:52.040 --> 49:55.199
We're not going to cover ourselves
in glory here, old girl.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.479
(ENGINE REVS)

49:58.440 --> 50:01.319
(COUNTS DOWN)

50:04.760 --> 50:05.959
Disastrous start!

50:06.080 --> 50:07.159
There it is!

50:10.080 --> 50:13.599
This is going to hurt,
we're going to have to rev you hard!

50:16.280 --> 50:18.239
JAMES: The sports truck is gaining.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.279
Gaining.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.119
Gaining, gaining.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.359
No!

50:28.360 --> 50:30.999
1 1 5 kilometres an hour!

50:32.520 --> 50:33.439
JAMES: Come on!

50:33.560 --> 50:34.759
Yes!

50:39.760 --> 50:41.439
Oh, victory is sweet!

50:43.120 --> 50:46.679
Second place.
But I have got a crane.

50:46.800 --> 50:50.439
Must brake, must brake! Ooooh!

50:50.560 --> 50:53.479
Got a football under the brake pedal!
That's bad.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.039
Hammond, have you finished yet?

51:01.480 --> 51:03.239
Still going.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.919
After I finally crossed the line,
we continued on

51:08.040 --> 51:12.759
and paid a visit to Naypyidaw's
incredibly modest temple!

51:18.240 --> 51:21.679
- Can we go up?
- Yeah?

51:21.800 --> 51:24.199
- Up there?
- Can we go and have a look?

51:24.320 --> 51:25.439
Shoes. No shoes!

51:25.560 --> 51:26.479
- No.
- Shoes?

51:26.600 --> 51:28.959
- JAMES: No shoes.
- RICHARD: We'll get wet feet.

51:29.080 --> 51:30.839
- Hello!
- OK!

51:32.880 --> 51:35.039
JAMES: I'm telling you,
Buddhism is the way forwards.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.399
- OK, yes, OK?
- Are we set?

51:38.520 --> 51:40.479
- No!
- I've taken them off.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.119
- That's my feet.
- No knee!

51:43.920 --> 51:45.799
No people from Birmingham!

51:45.920 --> 51:48.479
- Nobody from Birmingham is allowed!

51:48.600 --> 51:50.399
Oh, you've got to wear a skirt!

51:50.520 --> 51:51.959
- You can't show your legs.
- You can't show your knees.

51:52.080 --> 51:53.399
- Is it knees?
- Watch do I do with this?

51:53.520 --> 51:55.519
- Is it knees?
- Yes!

51:55.640 --> 51:57.119
- No knees and no...
- I've got knees!

- Oh, right!

51:59.720 --> 52:01.559
- Just put this skirt on.
- Oh! OK.

52:03.880 --> 52:07.479
Sitrep, Richard Hammond is
wearing a skirt.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.719
He's also being dressed by a man!

52:14.800 --> 52:16.559
Can we go? Is it OK?

52:16.680 --> 52:19.479
You look like a sort of contradictory
transsexual redneck!

52:21.600 --> 52:24.719
Would you like to know something
interesting, Richard Hammond?

52:24.840 --> 52:26.039
Yes, Jeremy Clarkson.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.999
- Ancient temple.
- Yes.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.759
- How old do you think it is?
- I don't know.

52:31.880 --> 52:33.639
They built this six years ago.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.879
To a butterfly, that is ancient.

52:37.160 --> 52:40.279
JEREMY: If eight billion people do come
to live here,

52:40.400 --> 52:42.679
they've certainly got
a place of worship.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.079
RICHARD: And it's a whopper.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.399
JAMES: What's interesting is, we've been
walking for about half an hour now,

52:46.520 --> 52:48.039
and it doesn't seem to have got
any closer.

52:48.160 --> 52:52.119
- It's like a mountain in the distance.
- The top of it is in the clouds.

52:52.240 --> 52:53.679
I've got the hem of my skirt wet!

52:55.640 --> 52:58.439
JEREMY: I am exhausted.

52:58.560 --> 53:02.639
Oh, guys, guys, traffic!

53:02.760 --> 53:05.439
Whoa, whoa, it's rammed!
We'd better get down there quick!

53:05.560 --> 53:07.479
Well, when I say traffic,
I mean one motorcycle.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.199
- Whoa!
- Exactly.

53:11.320 --> 53:12.799
It's stilltwo miles away.

53:24.280 --> 53:27.959
RICHARD: The inside was as mind-blowing
as the outside.

53:29.920 --> 53:34.999
And after drinking it all in,
we got back on the road...

I'm speaking to you now from underneath
my businessman's umbrella.

54:00.680 --> 54:03.999
It's taken the water
about 1 5 minutes to fathom it out,

54:04.120 --> 54:07.159
but it's in here now
and it's in in great quantities.

hitting a tree.

to deliver an interesting lecture...

from an engineering workshop

the correct tool for the job.

into the cab from under my new stack.

of my mobile maintenance service.

Seriously,
if that dog hadn't done that,

57:36.960 --> 57:40.599
I'd have gone onto the bridge
and I'd have hit the bus.

57:42.440 --> 57:46.799
Sadly, Buddhist dog wasn't around
when, five miles later,

57:46.920 --> 57:48.559
I had another breakdown.

57:50.120 --> 57:54.039
That's what came off. That's the
old one, which tore itself to shreds

57:54.160 --> 57:57.599
and in the process,
pulled the wire out of the sender

57:57.720 --> 57:59.999

so I don't have that any more.

to a night in our new
on-board accommodation.

58:13.320 --> 58:17.279
But thanks to the British Empire,
we didn't need it.

After a night here,
4,000 feet up a mountain

in a small village in the middle of Burma,

58:27.360 --> 58:32.199
at this strangely odd
but comfortable Bournemouth Hotel,

58:32.320 --> 58:34.559
we were feeling refreshed.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.199
And with Hammond leading,

58:37.320 --> 58:40.639
we were out of the village
in a mere couple of hours.

JAMES: Are we going to spend the whole day
tiptoeing under telephone wires?

58:59.600 --> 59:03.199
No, because you'll break down
eventually.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.719
JEREMY: OK, there's going to be
a motorcyclist coming past you.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.399
Check out his helmet.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.239
RICHARD: That's quite a strong statement.

59:18.480 --> 59:21.159
After a quick map check,

59:21.280 --> 59:24.479
I decided we should take
a tempting-looking short cut.

59:24.600 --> 59:27.679
Right, follow me.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.919
RICHARD: Follow you where?

59:33.040 --> 59:35.159
JEREMY: There's less traffic this way,
I think.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.759
That's because you can't drive down here!

59:40.880 --> 59:45.199
The road is only six inches wider
than my lorry.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.759
It's got tarmac on it!

Eventually, my scenic route
brought us to a remote settlement...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.159
that was very much...off the grid.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.479
Good thing is, in this little town,
there'll be no low wires.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.039
Instead, there was something worse.

as you,

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.479
Soon, James was getting a taste of what
the ride was like in my sports lorry.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.679
My nadgers are getting a pummelling.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.679
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.279
Look at the anal action
going on here!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.559
My horse is going up
your one's bottom.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:53.039
- Oh, Christ, we've had an accident!
- You go ahead.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.959
I'm terrified!

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.439
My nads are killing me!

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.879
- (HORSE GRUNTS)
- Oh, stop that, please don't fight!

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.719
- Walk on.
- I'll stop calling you Tesco

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.199
if you promise not to fight.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.919
Go!

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.959
Walk. There you go.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.439
- Oh, God above!
- Not much further now, James.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.439
Jesus! I mean - Buddha!

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.839
JEREMY: A few hundred yards further on,

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.199
Richard's stallion decided
to get amorous with James's mare.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.559
- (HORSE WHINNIES)
- Ooh! (BLEEP)

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.399
(HORSE WHINNIES)

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.439
Oh... (BLEEP)

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.399
JEREMY: Has he gone? What happened?

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.679
It reared and mounted that.
Don't get kicked.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.519
Things quickly went to pot.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.439
This is the doctor,
going to attend to Richard

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.439
but the van is stuck.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.639
I've just dismounted
my reversing horse,

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.959
and actually genuinely
have hurt my testes.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.359
Oh! I can see why
they should be glue, these things.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.919
RICHARD: I was diagnosed
with a suspected broken wrist

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.439
and went on a four-hourjourney
to the nearest hospital,

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.559
leaving Jeremy to walk his horse
to the next village to get fuel.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.559
You see, this is why you're no longer
of any use to anybody, because of fuel.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.359
Yes! You see, cars are better than you.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.519
Hello.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.839
Can I buy these jerry cans?

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.559
Yes.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.759
May!

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.519
Look what I have!

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.439
Well done.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.639
What's with the plastic flowers?

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.038
It's a road safety thing.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.279
If you have a horse with diesel on it,

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.279
- you have to have him in front of you.
- Oh, I see.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.719
Did you think to get a plastic funnel?

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.439
- Yep.
- Did you?

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.319
No. Hold that.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:09.839
(LAUGHS)

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.319
Hello, mate.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.959
Eventually, James and Jeremy found a spot
to camp for the night.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.198
(SIGHS)

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.479
Here, while I enjoyed the view,

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.319
James unveiled
his sleeping accommodation.

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:38.439
A mountaineering tent
he could suspend from his crane.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.439
So I'm going to rest it
against the front of the cab,

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.198
so all these bitey ants,
they don't get in your tent and eat you.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.759
(ENGINE TURNS OVER)

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.279
It may have been insect-proof...

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.359
...but soundproof?

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:53.799
No.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.839
(LOUD SNORING)

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.079
I wantto go to bed.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.999
But I can't, with that racket going on.
Listen to it.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.479
(LOUD SNORING)

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.199
JEREMY: The next morning
I discovered that Hammond was back.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.439
- So that's just a sprain?
- Yep. Not bust. Nothing exciting.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.519
So what is it you have to do,
basically steering...?

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.679
- Yeah, be all right.
- You just have to...

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.199
- Yeah. Still do that.
- Right.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.519
And how was sleeping in your lorry?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.479
- Um, not bad. What about yours?
- Fine.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.199
Where did James sleep in the end,
what's he done?

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.559
Oh, he's got some stupid, hi-tech

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.559
mountaineering tent
he's hung from his crane.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.039
Why is it up there?

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.959
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.879
Well... You know his snoring?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.039
Yeah.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.719
Quite loud. So I moved him
a bit further away.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.599
- (TENT ZIP OPENS)
- Jesus!

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.079
Clarkson!

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.279
What?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.479
Funny.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.679
- Very funny.
- Yes.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.119
I don't like heights,

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.079
- I don't like camping...
- I don't like snoring.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.359
RICHARD: Anyway, shall we get on?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.319
First, though,
we had to sortJames out.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.759
Yes, that's it.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.239
They're off.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.399
- Nice work, Hammond.
- Ow, ow, ow.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.799
They used to make mattresses
out of that stuff, apparently.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.879
- It's comfortable.
- Did they?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.879
- Look, he's nesting!
- (BOTH LAUGH)

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.799
Look at that!

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.279
(JEREMY LAUGHS UNCONTROLLABLY)

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.199
JAMES: After Pinky and Perky
had winched me down,

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.559
we set off on our seventh day
of long-distance lorry-driving.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.199
I'm still staggered
that they put diesel in my truck!

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.719
I mean, that's a generous gesture.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.319
Assuming it is diesel.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.879
(CLANGING)

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.519
Oh, no!

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.039
- Hammond... What's happened?
- I've lost my other stack.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.959
Well, as you know, we're not
the US Marines, we leave a man behind.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.879
Yeah, too hot. Er, right...

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.319
It's covered in ants...
Oh, it's an ants' nest!

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.319
That's a mistake. Ow!

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.159
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.719
JEREMY: Far ahead of Hammond's
disintegrating lorry,

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.879
James and I were about to enter
a secretive region of Burma

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.639
known as the Shan State.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.039
A civil war has raged here for 60 years.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.719
No television crew
has ever been allowed in.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.999
We would be the first.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.959
There's a very good reason
why it's so secretive in there.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.799
You see, the travel companies
would have you believe

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.999
that the Golden Triangle is...
Well, it's a tourist attraction

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.079
at the point where Thailand, Burma
and Laos all meet.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.199
But the golden triangle with the -
how can I put this? -

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.079
the special agriculture,
thatis in the Shan.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.679
Apparently, some of the special
agriculture is known as horse,

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:47.519
they're obviously growing horses
somehow. I shall look for those.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.159
Fields of horses growing...in them.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.919
Here we go. Warm and cordial welcome,
this is it. This is it.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.079
We are entering the Shan.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.319
We genuinely are representing
the Western world.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.439
Good job I'm wearing a tie.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.479
Unfortunately,
as the road started to climb,

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.759
James and I rather forgot
the significance of where we were.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.919
JAMES: No!

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.239
JEREMY: Come on, lorry!

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.919
(CACKLES)

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.919
Welcome, then, to the inaugural
Shan State lorry hill climb.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.719
A sport where
a single botched gear-change

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.359
can make all the difference.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.279
Slipstreaming.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.279
He's coming!

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.919
Aaaagh!

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.959
JEREMY: No, no, no!
No, I'm trapped by the pick-up.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.119
Eat my dirt.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.319
I've got the inside line.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.719
(CACKLES)

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.279
This is the best race in the world!

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.319
JEREMY: I've blocked him, I blocked him.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.799
JAMES: Shall we call a temporary truce
while we go through the town, yeah?

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.399
When we get back,
if we're interviewed by MI6 and they say,

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.719
"What was it like in the Shan?",
we'll have to go,

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.959
"I don't know, we were racing lorries."

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.759
I am embarrassed to be
the first Westerner in here

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.159
and I'm driving a sports lorry
with a pink teddy bear on the front!

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.999
(LAUGHS)

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.159
To make us look more dignified,
I put Rudyard in the cab,

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.039
and then we set off into the unknown.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.439
JEREMY: God above!

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.999
I think I've accidentally
taken a short cut

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.199
into the set of Game Of Thrones.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.319
Here, in a region that is bigger
than England and Wales put together,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.159
there is just one road,
built 1 50 years ago, by the British.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.039
But there's no electricity,
no mobile phone signal, no TV,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.599
no hotels, no hospitals.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.519
And in the skies, no planes.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.959
That is gigantic!

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.199
Bowled over by it all,
James and I pulled over,

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.479
and after Hammond caught up...

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.359
Oh, yes, the 1 920s is arriving.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.679
...we tried to work out why
us three had been the first ones

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.839
allowed in here.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:58.559
Think about it. If you were North Korea,
and you wanted to portray to your people

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.479
how lumpen and useless the West was,
you'd invite us three, wouldn't you?

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.879
Yeah.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.319
Because we'd wander about
and the North Koreans would go,

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.639
"Why would we want to be Western?
Look at them. They're dreadful."

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.559
- You've got bird poo on your shoulder.
- I have.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.799
So what the government is
actually saying is, to these people,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.519
why would you want to live

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.479
like they do in the West?
Because look at them.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.519
There's another thing that we're doing,

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.399
and this is just an incidental service,

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.159
they haven't seen
manyWesterners here.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.639
We are at least showing...
They're not going to end up saying,

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.279
"They all look the same to me," are they,
with us three? Clearly we don't.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.119
- That's just blatantly racist.
- No...

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.879
What he's saying is,
all Burmese people look the same to him.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.039
- No...
- Clearly.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.119
Yes, you are.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.519
You are. You're assuming that they think
we all look the same

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.479
because we think
they all look the same.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.399
Now you're making a leap,
I didn't...

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.879
You're completing something
that I didn't put in.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.799
Yes, we are,
but it's quite good fun.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.239
JEREMY: Keen to see more of the Shan,
we moved on.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.719
Chaps, check out the driver
of this tuk-tuk.

is it? It's lovely.

- Where?

Here, in the town.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.839

a civil war raging?

are coming together tonight

- Well, look, I don't know.

familiar with Top Gear, are they?

I'm speculating on

is I don't think we should turn up
looking like this.

use his shower,

they've got here.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.719
or the DEA

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.639

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.319
and it felt like it started
running on two,

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.119
and then it was definitely only running
on one cylinder, because it sounded like

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.199
the sort of generator
that people put on in the night.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.759
Ah... (BLEEP)

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.919
Non-BBC Two word!

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.079
Once I'd fixed the problem,
which was wonky fuel injectors,

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.759
I was on the move again.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.879
God, this lorry is appalling.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.559
And it didn't take long
to catch the others,

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.119
because the road was steep...

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.039
...and Hammond was in front.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.359
Oh, God!

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.039
First gear!

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.239
Bad!

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.479
Literally the slowest I've ever been.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.039
Hammond, I haven't got
any more gears left.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.359
I can't get out of the way,
the road's too narrow,

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.359
I can't go any faster,
I'm in a lorry!

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.599
It's pretty much vertical there.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.959
Oh, God, look at the smoke now!

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.479
You know, I've got a mining lung disease.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.519
I'm starting to imagine what Hammond
might look like without any skin on.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.199
Now what?

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.119
I think, if we all back up,
he can come in here.

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.479
Hammond, we can't,
there's nothing to be gained by...

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.799
(CRASH)

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.159
Hammond, you idiot, you've reversed
into the sports lorry!

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.199
- You've broken it.
- I didn't know.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.079
Genuinely, that was an accident!

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.319
Don'tjust drive off, Hammond!

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.399
Hammond. Hammond!

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:25.679
He's broken my headlights, radiator.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.399
My bull bar is broken.

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.239
I couldn't see you in the mirror.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.359
What, you just reverse and hope?!
Where did you think I was?

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.519
All day, I have been behind you.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.799
I didn't think you were
that close behind me.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.999
I now know why they have
those stickers for lorry-drivers -

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.959
"If you can't see my mirrors,
I can't see you."

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.719
RICHARD: Even though the incident
had been technically my fault,

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.519
I still followed
the standard procedure.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.439
What? He knows the rules.
Live by the sword, you must...

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.119
Cook with the sword? I can't remember.
Whatever. Something to do with swords.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:11.359
He held me up all day,
then he reversed into me,

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.839
so I think tonight
Hammond's other wrist might break.

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.479
However, when I reached
the overnight halt,

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.279
I came up with a more fiendish idea.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.039
An idea that involved the bucket
Hammond had fitted to collect rainwater

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.439
for his shower.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.519
(TRICKLING)

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.519
JEREMY: I think this...this does
pay him back

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.839
for holding us up all day long.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.279
JAMES: Yep.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.359
- JEREMY: Oh, there's more.
- JAMES: Part two. Ah!

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.999
I then began to work
on my lorry's waterworks.

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.759
Massive nuts holding that radiator on.

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.079
- 22 millimetres.
- Yeah, I know.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.119
- (SHOWER SPLATTERS)
- RICHARD: Oh!

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.239
It's actually warm!
So warm, fresh rainwater.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.519
(WHISPERS) Golden rain.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.559
RICHARD: I can taste the goodness.
It tastes of the outdoors.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.239
And neither of you two
thought of doing this.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.439
Ohh!

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.479
JEREMY: After dining on roast grasshopper,

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.439
we spent the evening
playing with my Chinese lanterns.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.919
- Are you going to set them off here?
- Why not?

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.999
I should say in a country where a lot
of people live in houses made of...

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.799
- What is it, dried grass?
- He's got a point, actually.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.199
- Oh, relax.
- That's not going to be a problem.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.199
The chances of you getting
one of those things to work...

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.519
(LAUGHTER)

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.839
Let go, let it fly.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.359
- Yes. Hammond, ye of little faith.
- Go find a barn or a thatched roof.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.959
JEREMY: Now, let's just... I'm going to
get a beer and savour the moment.

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.559
RICHARD: This is just a...
It's a mobile bonfire.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.519
It is. If it were to land in a field
of poppies, for example,

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:04.159
imagine how beautiful that would be.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.759
Feeling content and happy,
we went to bed.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.799
Well, one of us did.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.679
JAMES: What do you think
the chances are of waking him?

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.159
RICHARD: You won't wake him,
he sleeps the sleep of the dead!

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.159
- JAMES: So that's in neutral and...
- RICHARD: Yeah.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.559
(ENGINE REVS)

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.959
JEREMY: What the...?!

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.159
Jesus Christ! Ow!

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.119
JAMES: The next morning, despite
the tranquillity of our surroundings,

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.519
Jeremy hit the road
in a fractious mood.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.079
Why did you tip me out of my lorry?

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.039
Because you swung me around
in my tent.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.879
But you deserved that, because
you're irritating. I'm neverirritating.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.679
It's a good pointJeremy raises,
I feel quite bad about it now,

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.599
because when has he ever been irritating?

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.159
(LAUGHS)

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.839
To make my mood even worse,

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:22.239
the endless hard going had had
a catastrophic effect on my brakes.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.599
I think they're only working now
on the left-hand side.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.119
Nothing, everything.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.919
You move your foot that much,
that's the difference.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.319
Fortunately, we were now only 80 miles
from the border with Thailand.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.599
But, unfortunately,
none of those miles would be gentle.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.159
Oh, this'll be... It's bad in here,
it'll be worse in Jeremy's lorry.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.959
(MUMBLES TO HIMSELF)

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.959
JEREMY: It was desperately uncomfortable
and hot,

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.759
and ahead of us lay
the biggest mountain range yet.

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.159
This climb is exactly what you need
in a lorry with a leaky radiator(!)

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:42.879
RICHARD: Oh, that is a
trouser-threatening drop.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.919
(LAUGHS)

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.279
James May is a man
who does not like heights.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.599
He's also a man whose lorry has its front
axle held on with a bit of string.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.519
- JEREMY: How's your vertigo, May?
- OVERRADIO: I'm not looking.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.119
But thanks for reminding me.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.639
JEREMY: Progress was extremely slow

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.559
as I had to keep stopping to
refill my radiator.

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.439
Pouring out from exactly
where the Araldite was.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.399
Fairly convinced this is an
old wives' tale, but we shall see.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.239
Meanwhile, James was having
his first breakdown of the day.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.919

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.679
This time, it was the transfer box,

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.839
which had burst
free from its mountings.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.279
That's the transfer box, that's
the bracket where it's bolted on,

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.879
those two bolts have been
shaken out.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.599
Oh, cock!

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.399
JEREMY: God, it's still going on,
it's still more mountains.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.839
(SHOUTS) When will this end?!

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.399
Oh, my God, it gets steeper!
I've got to keep me moving.

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.919
If I stop, pulling away will
kill the clutch, I'm sure of that.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.359
JEREMY: OK, my temperature gauge is now
really very high.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.599
I'm looking for a little stream.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.879
Still, at least the mood was more cheerful
than it was at the back of the convoy.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.879

and I eventually reached the summit,

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.959
where there was one hell of a reward.

JEREMY: From here to the border with
Thailand, it was downhill all the way.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.479
Which for me, at least,
was a bit alarming.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.959
Oh, God. Look at that road now.

would you stay with it

or would you bail out?

here planning that very thing.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.839

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.559
1 9 miles of easy-going
on smooth roads.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:48.479
Oh, it's... Hammond, your tyre!
Your tyre is...

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.999
It's detonating, mate.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.359
It's hard to explain to you... (LAUGHS)

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.479
I'm not giving up. I'm not stopping.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.519
How many wheels do I need?!

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:13.519
Happily, the rest of my tyres
stayed inflated and as darkness fell,

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.839
we finally reached our destination.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.599
I believe we are at the River Kwai.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.039
The crane is here, everybody.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.119
It's bolted onto a... (BLEEP) ...lorry,
but never mind that.

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:38.239
My brain is frazzled. I don't want to
sweat in here any more,

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.239
I don't want to listen
to the lorry struggling and screaming

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.359
and straining to climb another hill.

01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:47.119
Ah, ah, ah!

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.599
I am going to sleep for 1 ,000 years.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.199
Has my spine come out
of the top of my head?

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.999
I can't see because my eyes
have been shaken loose.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.759
I think my pelvis has
moved round in my body.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.879
- I'm not surprised, in your lorry.
- Itjust doesn't work!

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.519
Cos your pedals are all different.

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.559
- You've got that as well.
- Releasing the clutch is that.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.599
It's like a Masonic dance thing
that I have to do every time.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.199
You know those power plates in gyms
that make you stupid?

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.439
(JUDDERS)

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.959
There's also a psychological thing -

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.119
every time I hear a diesel engine start,
I will have a nervous twitch.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.319
Manual gearboxes. I'm, erm... What? What?!

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.159
What?! You have ruined me and my life.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.519
The gearbox is too far from first to...

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.679
"The prisoners of war
walked to their bridge site.

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:42.279
"You have driven here, so shut up."

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.759
- "Work on the bridge starts at 05.00..."
- What?!

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:54.239
"...05.00. And you can't go home

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:58.239
"until all three lorries have
driven over it."

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.639
JEREMY: 05.00?!

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.679
JAMES: What's the point?
We're not actually still in the war.

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.519
- What's the point of 05.00?
- But it'll only be a little river.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.439
(SOFTLY) True.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.559
The next morning at precisely 05.00...
and 1 1 ,

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.759
we discovered just how wrong we were.

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.079
It is much wider than I thought
it was going to be.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.959
JAMES: I thought it would be one of those
comedic little gullies.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.719
- I did.
- It's 1 00 times wider.

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.719
JAMES: We were going to need
a 60-metre bridge,

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.439
so James went off to make plans,

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:54.999
and Hammond and I decided to measure
the depth of the water.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.919
Well, when I say Hammond and I...

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.559
- I'm approaching plumb depth.
- (LAUGHS)

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.679
Ah! Broach the plumb... (GASPS)

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.039
Oh, oh, oh! It's ever so cold!

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.399
Just...

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.719
I hate myjob!

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.399
I'm sorry!In Bridge On The River Kwai,
did Alec Guinness go,

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.559
"Oh, it's ever so cold"?

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.719
I bet he did in reality!
Oh! I bet he did in reality!

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.639
Oh!

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.119
Sadly, at this point, my colleague
was carried away by the current.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.839
Swim, man!

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.199
I am!

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.439
You're the weakest swimmer
in the world!

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:35.479
And since he was providing
no useful feedback,

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.919
I went to check on James's plans.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.079
This is what I was thinking.

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:43.479
The bank goes down at each side,
obviously.

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.559
We build up the approach area
with these baskets of stones,

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.799
make some vertical piles out of bamboo,
like this,

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.519
these longerons, I'm calling them,

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:55.599
they're just bamboo lashed together,
these will go this way...

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.039
Two tracks for the wheels, that's all you
need - the rest of it is immaterial -

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.039
and then a little superstructure
like this, all adding strength...

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.039
You know the sort of thing.
...so that it looks a bit like the film.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.519
Basically, we need to start
with rocks

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.399
and some wire mesh to make boxes
to put them in.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.399
- Where are we getting rocks from?
- Well, that's yourjob,

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.919
because you have the tipper lorry.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.159
JAMES: I set about making
the wire-mesh baskets...

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.919
...freed up the space in Jeremy's
cargo bay...

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:29.639
JEREMY: May, you imbecile!

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.039
...and when Hammond finally returned,

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.199
I sent them both off
to a nearby quarry to get the rocks.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.639
You put them in the front of this one.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.279
Yeah, stick them in the front.
Let's have these ones here.

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.879
Jeremy...are you going to do anything?

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.119
- What could I do?
- We're loading the trucks!

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.559
- You've gotta direct him where...
- He's loading them!

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:02.839
RICHARD: With the trucks loaded,
Jeremy finally got off his backside

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.159
and immediately started to shout at me.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.759
Hammond! You idiot!

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.439
What?

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.159
You put about 400 tonnes of rocks

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.319
and it is stuck.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.279
I woke you to say,

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.719
"Are you going to help with the loading?"

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.319
Your words were, "There's nothing to do!
There's a man doing it!"

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.679
That's exactly the kind of issue
you should have been awake for.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.439
How do I know what your load is?!
I don't know!

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.279
JEREMY: The only solution was to tip
some of the rocks out.

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.679
Oh, no, no, no!

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.479
Ooh, my! That's a remarkable accident.

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.879
Cos look...

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.599
Oh, jeez, no!

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.479
Your windscreen has actually come out.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.879
This is a... (BLEEPING)
...disaster now!

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.839
The breeze'll be nice(!)

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.159
JEREMY: Predictably, when we got back,
James was overflowing with sympathy.

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.319
(JAMES CHORTLES)

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.679
Did you head-butt it?

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.679
But look...

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:18.199
(JAMES GUFFAWS)

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.359
JEREMY: Richard and James began to load
their basket by hand.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:26.519
Oh, that's a big rock!

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.799
But I'm allergic to manual labour,
so I used horsepower instead.

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.399
And then I went into town to buy supper.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.919
What vegetables are these, I wonder.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:49.799
That's the strangest vegetable
I've ever seen. It's moving about!

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.359
Eel!

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.119
- Are these pets or supper?
- (INDISTINCT REPLY)

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.159
For...om-nom-nom-nom?

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:00.839
They're a bit bony for my taste.

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.679
Is this a marrow?

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.399
Fuk. It's the word "fuk".

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:09.799
- A...?
- Name - fuk.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.999
This is...

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:14.279
Crikey, is it? Right, well,
I thought it was a marrow.

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.799
There we are.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.879
That's something we've learned.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.759
- In Thailand, the word for...
- Fuk.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:23.119
Yes, it's that.
That's the word for "marrow".

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.079
What is this?

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:28.759
- Prik.
- A prick?

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.959
Well, for Richard Hammond maybe, but...

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:33.079
Prick?

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.999
Are all your words rude?

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.879
Tits.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.759
Arse.

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:52.279
When I returned, I brought with me
a gang of local labourers.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.599
RICHARD: What are you doing?

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.239
Well, there's no way we're going
to be able to

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.239
build this bridge by ourselves,
let's be reasonable.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.119
JAMES: Actually, he's right, Hammond.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.559
You and I are not going to be able
to build this bridge by ourselves.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.599
- I know, which was...
- Hello, officers won't work.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.839
Alec Guinness made that very plain

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.679
in, erm, Bridge On The River Kwai,
in the film.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.319
That was the whole premise
of the story, is that officers won't work.

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.559
- Who says...?
- You're an officer?

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.679
- Of course I'm an officer!
- Who says you're an officer?

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:20.959
I am! I'm the Alec Guinness figure here.
It's obvious.

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:22.759
- Because you've got a stick?
- Come along, chaps.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.599
That stick may disappear quite soon.

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.279
RICHARD: With the local chaps helping,
James and I started to make good progress.

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.999
However, as we toiled away,

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.919
the self-appointed officer seemed to be
setting up a children's tea party.

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.079
What are you doing now?

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.159
Well, it's a trick I learned, actually,

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.639
from the British, when they were in Burma
in the 1 9th century.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.039
They would employ some local young chap,

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.879
cover him in jam,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.159
he would follow them around all day
and he'dattract the insects.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.399
They called him a jam boy.

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.199
- This is myjam bear.
- It doesn't seem very fair.

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:29.159
It was, it was, because at the
end of the day, he got to keep the jam.

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.319
JEREMY: At the end of our long, difficult
day, I produced my delicious supper.

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:41.959
It smells very good, Clarkson.

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.079
- What is it?
- Mm.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.959
I'll whisper it to you, cos I can't
say it in front of the viewers.

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:50.119
- What?
- She just looked at me and went...

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.719
- (INAUDIBLE)
- What did you say?

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.599
- Well, I've heard about Thailand.
- Steady on!

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.159
I'd even prepared a treat for Hammond.

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.119
For afters, I've got you something
very special indeed.

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.119
What?

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.679
Well, I know you're partial to
a bit of Black Cock.

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:05.959
Mm.

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.079
Oh, yes!

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.919
And so I've managed to find...

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.479
Oh, you hero!

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:14.199
- Oh, well done.
- Black Cock.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.159
- Stiff one?
- Yes, please.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:19.159
- Get that down your neck.
- Cheers.

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.679
RICHARD: Bottoms up.

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.599
JEREMY: I'll tell you what,
I'm going to sleep tonight. Absolutely.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.279
I'm worn out.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.119
JAMES: The next morning...

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.719
...the dawn light revealed
just how little we'd achieved.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:50.959
So, before the morning mist had cleared,
everyone was hard at work.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.359
Well, when I say everyone...

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:57.359
(MOBILE PHONE ALARM)

01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.159
- Morning, May.
- Good morning.

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.119
Are you actually
going to do any work today?

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.359
I have explained this to you
until I'm blue in the face.

01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.839
Officers won't work.

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:40.319
Guys?

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.479
May?

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.319
Can you hear something?

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.599
JEREMY: I need a poo!

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.239
Guys, I've had a thought.
It turns out officers will work.

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.959
After they released me...

01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.919
- Right, work.
- Remains available.

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.799
...I immediately decided we needed more
labour-saving machinery

01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.119
so I rented a digger for Hammond

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.199
and I went for
something that would humiliate May.

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.679
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.759
I'm afraid James has totallywasted
his time bringing that crane here.

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.839
Go on, son!

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.719
Oh, no!

01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:44.079
(BLEEPING)

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.279
- RICHARD: What was that?!
- It fell over, James.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.399
- Do you see...?
- What have you done?!

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.719
- Hold on a minute!
- What?

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.079
Do you see where the end
of yourjib landed?

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:55.919
I had only walked back
to see where the pile was.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.999
If I'd still been standing there, it
would've taken my head off, you madman!

01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.679
- It fell over!
- It almost killed me!

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:01.319
What do you mean, it fell over?
It doesn't...

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.679
They don't fall over, crane lorries!

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:05.079
- They don't fall over on the motorway!
- RICHARD: Well, it has done, hasn't it?

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.759
- What do you mean, it doesn't fall over?
- You knocked it over!

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.759
Your crane is too small,

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:11.719
so I've got a bigger one
to reach further into the river.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.879
Right. My crane is too small.
That's punishable by death, is it?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.879
JEREMY: AfterJames had calmed down a bit,
we decided to solve the problem

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.239
by using the combined power of
Richard's digger and the A-May van.

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.359
In three, two, one...

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.999
Lift away!

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.479
Oh!

01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.919
Yeah...

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:55.839
But with stronger cables,
we soon had my crane the right way up.

01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.319
Excellent. And back to work.

Oi!

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:30.319
That little insect that he's
dragged all the way here is simply

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.719
getting in our way.

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.479
Oh, well done, Hammond.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:37.919
Hang on.

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.199
JEREMY: That's the ticket!

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.559
- Hammond!
- Come on, James, out you come.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.279
Spiky things!

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.479
Even though we were now working as
a team, and the bridge was starting

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:56.679
to take shape, we were still
way behind James's schedule.

01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.599
This side, the blue pegs, represents
how far we should have got by now.

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.839
The red pegs show how far
we actually have got.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.479
- Obviously, not far enough.
- It's worse than I thought.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.399
So, the three of us worked
on into the night.

- This is long.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.119
That's to go to Hammond.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.639
- Whoa, stop there.
- It's a bit further.

01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:19.839
- I've got it, no, I've got it.
- You sure?

01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.879

we went to bed exhausted...

by the current, I noticed that

the end of the bridge was now
beyond the reach of our cranes.

we built a home-made pile-driver...

to the opposite bank.

- that I lie down on.
- You are lying down

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:16.319

- not have been able to lie down.
- Exactly.

before I could enjoy...

from an internet website.

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:50.639
and we were desperate to get home

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:53.039
so we were working round the clock.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.439
- Got it?
- Yeah.

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.279

You know, after that drive through Burma,

02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:22.479
I was left with
an enormous amount of respect

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:25.279

- No, no.

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.479

- Yeah.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.639
There was a guy called Captain Drower

02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:01.039
who broke the camp commandant's table.

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:04.879
He was sentenced to life underground
and they buried him

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.999
in one of those metal boxes
with the metal roof exposed to the sun,

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.599
and he was in there for 76 days.

- Oh, God.
- 76...

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:16.239
He had a broken arm when they put him in
and when they got him out,

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:18.959

most of one of his feet.

Why am I crossing it first?

02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:16.919
Because I just said,
"James May, you shall cross it first."

- Yes, I will go next.
- Really?

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:05.799
Yes, because your lorry is
a lot heavier than my lorry

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.319

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.599
