WEBVTT

00:01.750 --> 00:03.427
Over 68 million Americans

00:03.469 --> 00:05.976
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.785
If danger strikes,

00:08.016 --> 00:10.574
the FBI's International Response Team

00:10.641 --> 00:11.998
is called into action.

00:26.696 --> 00:28.696
- After all this time...
- Oh-ho!

00:28.731 --> 00:29.743
They're finally here.

00:29.782 --> 00:31.094
Check it out. Here's a sample.

00:31.204 --> 00:33.867
Ah!

00:33.902 --> 00:36.178
Now that's a good looking
shirt right there, man.

00:36.249 --> 00:38.049
It's a dream come true is what it is.

00:38.084 --> 00:40.885
Hey, there's no one I'd
rather be on this journey with.

00:40.921 --> 00:41.652
I mean that.

00:41.687 --> 00:43.922
Hey, buddy, me too.

00:43.957 --> 00:46.724
Now, are you gonna go
with the white Range

00:46.759 --> 00:47.825
or the pimped out dad van?

00:47.860 --> 00:49.560
Okay, let's sell some T-shirts first.

00:49.595 --> 00:51.995
Hey, I'm just saying, Davey,
is that the white Range,

00:52.031 --> 00:53.130
actually really nice for kids.

00:53.165 --> 00:54.899
Yeah, kids and freeloading friends.

00:54.934 --> 00:56.901
Hey, whoa, hey! Quid pro quo.

00:56.936 --> 00:59.837
You get the sweet ride, I will
secure the dope bachelor pad.

00:59.872 --> 01:01.639
See, it all works out.

01:01.674 --> 01:02.773
Oh, glad you got it figured out.

01:02.809 --> 01:03.908
Oh, yeah. Thought about this.

01:03.943 --> 01:05.642
Hey.

01:05.677 --> 01:07.945
Yes. A little something
stronger than tea.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.813
Finally. Okay.

01:09.848 --> 01:11.648
A toast.

01:11.683 --> 01:13.016
To living the dream.

01:13.052 --> 01:14.517
To getting rich while trying.

01:14.553 --> 01:16.186
It's to get rich or die trying.

01:16.221 --> 01:17.654
Ah. Whatever.

01:17.689 --> 01:18.922
To friends.

01:18.958 --> 01:19.856
To friends.

01:22.794 --> 01:23.793
Mmm!

01:23.829 --> 01:25.328
- Oh, boy!
- Whoo!

01:25.363 --> 01:26.262
I want another!

01:26.297 --> 01:27.664
Let's all do another!

01:27.699 --> 01:29.599
Round for the entire bar, please.

01:39.543 --> 01:42.111
When we get to, Amar
Maayar Ghare, you will see.

01:42.146 --> 01:45.181
Lot of family and food.
A feast. Inshallah.

01:45.216 --> 01:47.616
Oh, I'm not gonna lie,
brother. I can eat.

01:47.651 --> 01:49.218
I should call Diane
before it gets too late.

01:49.253 --> 01:50.886
Hey, you know what I should do, Dave?

01:50.921 --> 01:53.122
I should find myself a beautiful woman,

01:53.157 --> 01:54.690
go out and do a little dancing.

01:54.725 --> 01:56.324
They don't have clubs here.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.060
That's what you say.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.567
Hey.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.535
How'd it go?

02:06.570 --> 02:07.669
Well...

02:07.705 --> 02:08.871
We closed the deal.

02:08.906 --> 02:10.138
It's all happening, babe.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.406
- Oh, my God.
- We don't have to worry

02:11.441 --> 02:12.640
about anything anymore.

02:12.675 --> 02:16.044
David, I'm so incredibly proud of you.

02:16.079 --> 02:17.812
Hey, can I talk to our little Susie Q?

02:17.847 --> 02:21.149
Well, we're... we're not
calling her that, so...

02:21.184 --> 02:24.052
Hello, Diane?

02:24.087 --> 02:25.053
Yeah, no, I'm here.

02:25.088 --> 02:26.351
Here.

02:26.390 --> 02:29.023
Let me hold the phone
so she can hear you.

02:29.058 --> 02:30.525
Say hi.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.693
Hey, little one, it's your dad!

02:33.596 --> 02:36.063
Hey, I miss you so
much. Can you hear me?

02:36.098 --> 02:38.499
I can't wait to tell you
the good news face to face.

02:38.535 --> 02:39.834
Jamal, where are we?

02:39.869 --> 02:41.035
This is a short cut.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.803
Everything okay?

02:49.478 --> 02:51.978
There's more of them.
What... what do they want?

02:55.117 --> 02:56.917
What do we do, guys? What...

02:56.952 --> 02:58.218
- What do we do.
- Hold on, Diane.

02:58.254 --> 02:59.853
Go. Drive through them.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.221
- Go, keep driving! Go!
- Just go!

03:02.257 --> 03:03.256
Please!

03:05.827 --> 03:07.093
Okay, yeah.

03:07.128 --> 03:09.462
Aah!

03:09.497 --> 03:10.480
What do you want?!

03:10.488 --> 03:11.620
Ow, wait!

03:12.133 --> 03:13.399
Please, what do you...

03:13.435 --> 03:15.035
What are you doing?!

03:16.504 --> 03:17.970
David?

03:19.441 --> 03:20.806
- I'll give you money!
- Quiet!

03:20.841 --> 03:22.942
I'll give you money!

03:22.977 --> 03:25.111
David?

03:25.146 --> 03:27.012
David?

03:28.683 --> 03:30.916
No. David?

03:35.122 --> 03:37.155
Thank you for helping me pack.

03:37.191 --> 03:39.058
I can't remember the last time we moved.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.159
Yeah, well, you always have
more stuff than you realize.

03:41.195 --> 03:44.029
I know, I do this every year.

03:45.299 --> 03:48.166
What? I like to keep it fresh.

03:48.202 --> 03:51.169
Although I have never lived
in a house like this before.

03:51.205 --> 03:54.106
Yeah, well, when Brad and I got married,

03:54.141 --> 03:57.775
he was big on making
this place feel like ours.

03:57.811 --> 04:00.278
It's been almost three
years since he died,

04:00.314 --> 04:02.847
and I can't keep living in the past.

04:02.882 --> 04:06.017
Besides, if I stay any
longer, I may never leave.

04:09.723 --> 04:12.189
We are never gonna finish this.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.491
Yeah, we may need to call

04:13.526 --> 04:15.526
that Hot Guys moving company after all.

04:15.561 --> 04:17.762
No. We are not calling Simmons' friends.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.130
Clara, they were in the Army.

04:19.165 --> 04:20.832
So what?

04:20.867 --> 04:22.166
What does that mean? They're so hot.

04:22.201 --> 04:23.800
Maybe you should call them.

04:23.836 --> 04:25.669
Great, you're here.

04:25.704 --> 04:26.970
Go ahead, Monty.

04:27.006 --> 04:28.839
Okay, it's been
approximately eight hours

04:28.874 --> 04:31.041
since American entrepreneurs
David Curry and Robbie Garcia

04:31.076 --> 04:32.676
went missing in Bangladesh.

04:32.711 --> 04:34.145
They and their driver were ambushed

04:34.180 --> 04:35.679
while David was on the
phone with his wife.

04:35.714 --> 04:37.148
Oh, can you imagine?

04:37.183 --> 04:38.715
This is their first time in country?

04:38.758 --> 04:40.190
Yeah, first time anywhere.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.802
They were in Dhaka to find a factory

04:41.849 --> 04:44.354
for their start-up
clothing brand, Team Kings.

04:44.389 --> 04:46.456
It's not surprising Bangladesh
was the country of choice

04:46.491 --> 04:47.691
for two up and coming entrepreneurs.

04:47.726 --> 04:50.794
They have the fourth-fastest
growing economy in the world.

04:50.829 --> 04:53.396
So according to the embassy,
three foreigners were attacked

04:53.431 --> 04:56.065
and killed in broad daylight
by men wielding machetes

04:56.100 --> 04:57.200
in the past two months.

04:57.235 --> 04:59.636
There's been an up tick in
violence against foreigners

04:59.671 --> 05:02.672
in and around Dhaka, but the abduction

05:02.707 --> 05:04.840
of Robbie and David doesn't fit the M.O.

05:04.876 --> 05:05.975
Yeah, for one, the others were

05:06.010 --> 05:08.144
attacked and killed in the
street in broad daylight.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.046
David and Robbie were ambushed
at night while driving.

05:10.081 --> 05:12.414
And abducted, which makes
me think they're still alive.

05:12.449 --> 05:14.183
So the question is,
why and for how long?

05:14.218 --> 05:15.685
So what do the local authorities say?

05:15.720 --> 05:17.838
They believe this was
a robbery gone bad.

05:17.869 --> 05:18.988
David and Robbie were in

05:19.023 --> 05:20.690
the wrong place at the wrong time.

05:20.725 --> 05:22.825
They're expecting this to end badly.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.560
Monty, what do we know
about David and Robbie?

05:24.595 --> 05:27.196
They're both from New
York. Huge Jets fans.

05:27.231 --> 05:29.598
Both in their mid-30s. David is married.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.167
His wife, Diane, who's pregnant,
is on the way here as we speak.

05:32.203 --> 05:34.069
Uh, Robbie is your
prototypical bachelor,

05:34.104 --> 05:35.204
according to social media.

05:35.239 --> 05:36.705
And what about this driver?

05:36.740 --> 05:37.673
His name is Jamal Muti.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.074
And other than the
fact that he's missing,

05:39.109 --> 05:40.275
I know very little.

05:40.311 --> 05:42.277
So is Jamal a victim, as well?

05:42.313 --> 05:44.045
Or did he set them up?

05:44.081 --> 05:46.347
We've got a lot of unknowns here.

05:48.085 --> 05:51.452
As with most abductions, the
first 24 hours are crucial.

05:51.487 --> 05:53.354
So when we land, we
need to work quickly.

05:53.389 --> 05:56.825
Robbie and David's lives depend on it.

05:57.738 --> 06:00.762
We turned right, back
towards the city, I think.

06:00.797 --> 06:01.873
I don't... I don't know.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.365
- We got to get out of here.
- We don't know where here is.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.100
Robbie, they're gonna kill us.

06:06.135 --> 06:08.536
If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead.

06:11.474 --> 06:12.340
You guilty.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.208
Stop, please! Why are you doing this?

06:14.244 --> 06:15.443
- Dave?
- Why are you doing this?!

06:17.413 --> 06:18.612
- I don't know.
- Guilty!

06:20.415 --> 06:21.281
Oh, God!

06:21.316 --> 06:22.482
Robbie!

06:44.747 --> 06:47.182
"The small truth has
words which are clear.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.144
The great truth has great silence."

06:49.161 --> 06:50.364
R. Tagore.

07:12.538 --> 07:14.337
Hope I'm doing this right.

07:14.405 --> 07:16.752
Oh, it's the gesture that counts.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.524
You know, Bangladesh
has one of the worst

07:19.559 --> 07:21.659
police-to-civilian ratios in the world.

07:21.695 --> 07:23.928
In a country that's 162 million people,

07:23.963 --> 07:27.264
there's only 150,000 officers.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.700
I spoke with Sergeant Bhaduri,

07:29.735 --> 07:32.436
and he agreed to be our escort.

07:36.209 --> 07:37.641
Man, you weren't kidding.

07:37.676 --> 07:39.543
This place is a ghost town.

07:39.578 --> 07:41.011
Yeah, well, their economy is growing

07:41.047 --> 07:42.679
faster than their infrastructure.

07:47.519 --> 07:49.319
My apologies. I'm Constable Hoque.

07:49.355 --> 07:50.520
You are Jack Garrett?

07:50.556 --> 07:52.356
Yes. And this is my team,

07:52.391 --> 07:54.458
Agents Seger, Simmons, and Jarvis.

07:54.493 --> 07:56.125
Sergeant-da Bhaduri is away.

07:56.161 --> 07:58.661
There was a haartal...
Strike in Farmgate.

07:58.696 --> 08:00.129
We are most busy.

08:00.165 --> 08:02.198
Please, this way.

08:04.502 --> 08:06.135
With the demands on the department,

08:06.171 --> 08:07.636
we have not made much
progress on the case

08:07.672 --> 08:08.537
of the missing Americans.

08:08.573 --> 08:13.076
But, uh, it is okay with us you start.

08:13.111 --> 08:15.478
You can work in this area.

08:15.513 --> 08:17.413
I'm the only one here, so I must stay,

08:17.448 --> 08:19.482
but Sergeant-da Bhaduri
will join you when he can.

08:19.517 --> 08:20.716
Thank you.

08:20.752 --> 08:21.817
Oh.

08:21.853 --> 08:24.854
We have an address for the
missing driver, Jamal Muti.

08:24.889 --> 08:28.023
No one has gone to see yet.

08:28.058 --> 08:29.525
You go, okay?

08:29.560 --> 08:30.559
Thank you.

08:32.897 --> 08:34.863
Guess we're on our own.

08:34.899 --> 08:36.831
Yeah, well, until the last decade or so,

08:36.866 --> 08:38.933
few locals traveled
and ever fewer tourists

08:38.969 --> 08:40.068
visited Bangladesh.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.871
And without an escort,
communication may be an issue.

08:42.907 --> 08:45.440
Well, let's not let it get in our way.

08:45.475 --> 08:47.509
I want us working
forwards and backwards.

08:47.544 --> 08:49.544
We need to determine if David and Robbie

08:49.579 --> 08:52.246
were targeted or if their abduction

08:52.282 --> 08:53.915
was a crime of opportunity.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.116
Okay, I got Monty.

08:55.151 --> 08:57.886
- Monty?
- I'm here.

08:57.921 --> 09:00.588
David was on the phone
when they were abducted.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.390
See what you can pull
from the phone company.

09:02.426 --> 09:04.625
And let us know what you
learn from David's wife.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.428
Copy, but just a head's up,
the cellular network in Dhaka

09:07.463 --> 09:08.462
is a bit antiquated,

09:08.497 --> 09:10.097
so I have to work
backwards through the logs.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.799
It may take me some
time, but I'll do my best.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.367
Great.

09:13.403 --> 09:15.636
Simmons and Mae, track down Jamal.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.571
If he was taken along
with Davey and Robbie,

09:17.606 --> 09:20.541
we need to find out why.

09:20.576 --> 09:22.443
Clara, let's you and I
focus on what we can learn

09:22.478 --> 09:25.245
about the guys before they went missing.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.147
Well, they settled a
bill just minutes before

09:27.182 --> 09:29.716
they were abducted at
a local ex-pat club.

09:29.752 --> 09:32.118
We'll start there.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.222
Oh, thank you.

09:36.258 --> 09:38.758
David and Robbie, they've been
friends since grade school,

09:38.793 --> 09:40.560
and they've worked
with various designers

09:40.595 --> 09:41.394
and clothing companies.

09:41.430 --> 09:42.628
And it was always dream of theirs

09:42.664 --> 09:43.763
to launch their own brand.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.665
And this year, they finally
got the money together.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.267
Mm-hmm. The trip to Bangladesh,

09:47.302 --> 09:48.801
it was the final piece of the puzzle.

09:48.837 --> 09:53.139
I mean, their company's initial
valuation was $5 million.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.608
That's a lot of money at stake,
so they wanted to be there

09:55.643 --> 09:56.776
to personally select their supplier.

09:56.811 --> 09:59.745
So David handled the business,
and Robbie was the artist?

09:59.781 --> 10:01.981
Yes. Yeah. I mean, they
designed street wear

10:02.016 --> 10:05.618
like Obey or Supreme, and...

10:07.121 --> 10:08.588
Sorry.

10:08.623 --> 10:10.655
David, I mean, he
didn't even want to go.

10:10.691 --> 10:15.327
I'm... I'm due in a week,
and this is his dream.

10:15.363 --> 10:17.496
And with the little one coming,
I mean, we just, we couldn't

10:17.531 --> 10:20.932
let an opportunity like this pass by.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.135
Um...

10:24.372 --> 10:28.339
I made copies of everything,
their visas, their itinerary,

10:28.375 --> 10:29.674
the letter of invitation.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.510
Letter of invitation?

10:31.545 --> 10:32.978
In order to do business in Bangladesh,

10:33.013 --> 10:36.280
you have to be invited
by a local company.

10:36.316 --> 10:38.650
This is very helpful.

10:40.053 --> 10:41.853
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

10:41.889 --> 10:43.221
Okay?

10:43.256 --> 10:45.490
And... and whatever you need, I'm here.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.035
Were you working last night?

10:57.070 --> 10:58.836
Yeah. Uh, I was.

10:58.871 --> 11:00.170
Do you recognize these two?

11:00.205 --> 11:02.673
Yeah. Um, they were cool guys.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.408
Um, Americans.

11:04.443 --> 11:06.043
They were celebrating some kind of deal

11:06.078 --> 11:07.645
they'd just closed on a clothing line.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.580
Were they waiting for anyone?

11:09.615 --> 11:12.016
Did you notice anything
unusual about them?

11:12.051 --> 11:15.519
No. Um, they bought a round
of shots for the whole bar.

11:15.555 --> 11:17.654
I mean, like I said, nice guys.

11:17.689 --> 11:20.524
They, um, even gave me one
of their T-shirts, actually.

11:20.559 --> 11:21.324
Do you still have it?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.060
Yeah, um, I think it's in the back.

11:23.095 --> 11:24.928
I can show you.

11:24.963 --> 11:25.929
It's Monty.

11:25.964 --> 11:27.234
You go.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.867
Hey, Monty, what do you got?

11:30.902 --> 11:31.935
Not sure just yet.

11:31.970 --> 11:33.703
But it turns out, in order to obtain

11:33.738 --> 11:36.072
a business visa in Bangladesh,
David and Robbie had to be

11:36.107 --> 11:38.708
invited by a local company, Toj.

11:38.743 --> 11:40.209
Now, Toj sponsored their trip to Dhaka,

11:40.244 --> 11:42.178
they paid for the plane
ticket, hotel, et cetera.

11:42.213 --> 11:43.379
But Toj is in trouble.

11:43.414 --> 11:45.448
The deal with the Americans
would have had a huge impact

11:45.483 --> 11:46.115
on their bottom line.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.249
In fact, they had taken out

11:47.285 --> 11:49.185
a line of credit on
speculation of future earnings.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.753
Okay, just send us
everything you can, all right?

11:51.789 --> 11:52.788
Will do.

11:52.823 --> 11:53.889
Thanks.

11:55.826 --> 11:59.095
Can I buy you a drink?

11:59.130 --> 12:00.262
Jeffery Khan. Hi.

12:00.298 --> 12:02.764
Hi. Clara Seger.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.101
I'm actually here on business.

12:05.136 --> 12:07.636
The disappearance of two Americans.

12:07.671 --> 12:08.536
How did you know that?

12:08.572 --> 12:09.571
It's my job to know.

12:09.607 --> 12:11.940
And I saw you flash your
badge to the bartender.

12:11.976 --> 12:14.442
Ah. You are a journalist.

12:14.478 --> 12:16.778
Yeah. For the BBC.

12:16.814 --> 12:19.114
And you're here with
the FBI, I'm guessing.

12:19.149 --> 12:20.082
Yes.

12:20.117 --> 12:21.917
A woman with a gun.

12:21.952 --> 12:24.419
Uh, yes, and I'm not afraid to use it.

12:24.454 --> 12:26.187
I like that.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.624
Um...

12:29.659 --> 12:31.126
Excuse me.

12:32.962 --> 12:34.562
So, it looks like the shirts were

12:34.598 --> 12:37.432
David and Robbie's final piece
of business before heading here.

12:37.467 --> 12:40.001
I probably could track
down a manufacturer,

12:40.036 --> 12:42.236
but there's no RN number,

12:42.271 --> 12:44.071
just this inscription in Bengali.

12:44.107 --> 12:47.074
I don't mean to interrupt,
but no tracking number

12:47.110 --> 12:49.510
usually means it's a
bootleg or a sample.

12:49.545 --> 12:53.614
Um, Jack, this is
Jeffery Khan from the BBC.

12:54.488 --> 12:56.121
May I?

13:00.122 --> 13:02.856
Yeah, there's an inscription
here, at the seam.

13:02.891 --> 13:03.990
Tiger Industries.

13:04.026 --> 13:05.859
They're up on Hazaribagh.

13:05.894 --> 13:07.827
And the owner's called Hasan.

13:09.898 --> 13:10.997
Thank you.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.265
Another time.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.800
Perhaps?

13:15.871 --> 13:18.204
Jack, Monty said a company called Toj

13:18.239 --> 13:20.506
paid for their trip,
not Tiger Industries.

13:20.542 --> 13:23.043
So they were being wooed by one company

13:23.078 --> 13:25.311
and chose to do business with another.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.181
Yeah, so if David and Robbie
backed out at the last minute,

13:28.216 --> 13:30.015
we're talking about a lot of money.

13:30.051 --> 13:33.286
I mean, the owner of Toj
would certainly have motive.

13:33.321 --> 13:34.687
Motive enough to kidnap?

13:34.722 --> 13:35.954
Maybe enough to kill.

13:35.990 --> 13:37.657
Let's find out.

13:51.772 --> 13:53.839
Police!

13:53.874 --> 13:55.808
Jamal Muti?

14:02.683 --> 14:05.684
Here's an unopened paycheck.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.552
Looks like Jamal worked for Toj.

14:07.588 --> 14:09.588
Their local sponsor.

14:27.941 --> 14:29.440
Don't even think about it!

14:29.475 --> 14:32.777
Jamal? Are you Jamal Muti?

14:32.812 --> 14:35.912
Hold still. Move your hand. Move it.

14:39.418 --> 14:40.517
Here.

14:42.488 --> 14:43.920
It's not him.

14:43.956 --> 14:46.423
This is Tokay.

14:46.459 --> 14:48.859
Bad move, Tokay.

14:54.432 --> 14:55.899
The ready-made garment industry

14:55.934 --> 14:58.368
is about as cutthroat as it gets.

14:58.403 --> 15:00.436
Sweatshops like this are common.

15:00.472 --> 15:02.906
Suppliers are locked
in a race to the bottom

15:02.941 --> 15:05.909
while international corporations
struggle to improve sales.

15:05.944 --> 15:08.711
Yep, anything goes. According to Monty,

15:08.747 --> 15:10.446
the owner of Toj, Niklas Poulsen,

15:10.482 --> 15:12.948
has had more than one
brush with controversy.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.785
Yeah, under-aged workers,
unsafe work environments.

15:16.888 --> 15:19.489
If David and Robbie chose
to do business elsewhere,

15:19.524 --> 15:20.256
I can see why.

15:20.292 --> 15:21.624
That was Mae.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.958
Jamal may be trouble.

15:22.994 --> 15:24.293
He works for Toj.

15:24.328 --> 15:26.595
Poulsen's failed before.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.130
And there's more than money on the line.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.965
His legacy is at stake.

15:30.001 --> 15:32.868
No questions, just do it.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.705
Mr. Poulsen?

15:36.740 --> 15:39.508
Is the FBI here to investigate
the thieving Americans

15:39.543 --> 15:41.075
who defrauded me and ran?

15:41.111 --> 15:44.846
I'm Unit Chief Jack Garrett,
this is SSA Clara Seger.

15:44.881 --> 15:47.949
David Curry and his partner
are in breach of contract.

15:47.984 --> 15:50.118
I already instructed my
lawyers to file a suit.

15:50.153 --> 15:52.587
Mr. Poulsen, are you
aware that David and Robbie

15:52.623 --> 15:56.024
have been abducted and
are currently missing?

15:56.059 --> 15:58.092
I spent thousands of
dollars bringing them here

15:58.128 --> 16:00.028
and made all the introductions,
laid the groundwork...

16:00.063 --> 16:01.129
Everything.

16:01.164 --> 16:02.831
And they showed me the door.

16:02.866 --> 16:05.266
So, no, I can't say I'm
shocked they got into

16:05.302 --> 16:06.434
some kind of trouble.

16:06.469 --> 16:07.936
When's the last time you saw them?

16:07.971 --> 16:10.305
Does this mean I'm not
going to get back my money?

16:10.340 --> 16:12.841
How long has Jamal Muti worked for you?

16:12.876 --> 16:14.172
Jamal?

16:14.258 --> 16:15.175
I fired him.

16:15.211 --> 16:16.276
When?

16:16.312 --> 16:17.611
A few days ago.

16:17.647 --> 16:19.847
He's the one who undercut me.

16:19.882 --> 16:21.882
Fixed the Americans up
with one of my competitors,

16:21.917 --> 16:22.683
stole my finder's fee

16:22.719 --> 16:24.652
and percentage of future earnings.

16:24.687 --> 16:26.220
Do you know where he is now?

16:26.255 --> 16:28.021
You know he has a record.

16:28.057 --> 16:29.957
Priors for theft and assault.

16:29.992 --> 16:33.060
He knows better than to show
his face around here again.

16:33.095 --> 16:34.862
If it's Jamal you're
after, I can't help you.

16:34.897 --> 16:38.065
Mr. Poulsen, we'll need a
copy of Jamal's personnel file

16:38.100 --> 16:39.867
and employment history.

16:39.902 --> 16:41.668
I don't have those records on hand.

16:41.703 --> 16:43.036
Then make a call.

16:43.072 --> 16:44.938
Find someone who does.

16:50.679 --> 16:52.044
Kutcha, get me Jamal Muti's file.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.880
What a piece of work.

16:53.915 --> 16:55.014
Classic narcissist.

16:55.049 --> 16:55.948
Yeah.

16:55.984 --> 16:57.917
Even still, I don't
think he was involved

16:57.952 --> 16:59.352
in David and Robbie's abduction.

16:59.388 --> 17:01.421
I mean, he foolishly
confirmed his own motive

17:01.456 --> 17:03.055
before he even knew why we were here.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.090
And he already has a plan
of action to deal with them.

17:05.126 --> 17:06.092
I agree.

17:06.127 --> 17:07.693
He's not behind this.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.228
But if Poulsen fired him,

17:09.263 --> 17:12.698
why was Jamal still driving
David and Robbie around.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.599
Go ahead, Simmons.

17:14.635 --> 17:16.667
Hey, Jack, so we did not find Jamal,

17:16.704 --> 17:17.669
but we did learn something interesting.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.005
Yeah, Jamal is in some
pretty serious debt.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.907
He recently took out a loan
with a local gang leader,

17:22.943 --> 17:25.109
and his creditor just came collecting.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.912
We arrested a man named
Tokay, who said he was hired

17:26.946 --> 17:29.214
to scare Jamal into.
Making his payments on time.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.717
Who does Tokay work for?

17:31.752 --> 17:33.952
Well, Constable Hoque
thinks he's just a hired gun.

17:33.987 --> 17:35.687
He works for whoever's
paying him this week.

17:35.723 --> 17:37.722
Yeah, this whole thing might
come down to the fact that

17:37.757 --> 17:40.892
Jamal owes some big money
to some pretty bad men.

17:40.928 --> 17:43.461
So David and Robbie just got
caught in the cross hairs.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.462
Right, and that's not all.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.064
Monty came through. With
the cell tower records,

17:46.099 --> 17:47.698
so we're headed to where he thinks

17:47.734 --> 17:49.367
is the primary abduction site right now.

17:49.403 --> 17:50.302
Great. Go.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.904
We'll catch up with
you as soon as we can.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.975
Just get him to talk with us.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.777
Figure out what he wants.

17:59.813 --> 18:02.647
Davey, he's crazy.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.916
We're not gonna be able to
talk our way out of this.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.387
What if we never make it back?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.122
I... I don't get to meet my baby girl.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.458
Hey, don't talk like that.

18:14.493 --> 18:18.562
That family of yours is counting on you.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.598
The next time he comes in here...

18:21.633 --> 18:23.633
I'll distract him.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.668
How?

18:24.703 --> 18:26.135
I don't know.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.804
But I'll figure something out.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.306
But you got to run.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.109
I'm not leaving here without you.

18:33.144 --> 18:36.980
I wasn't planning on staying behind.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.483
I'm gonna knock the son of a bitch out.

18:42.954 --> 18:45.989
Like Kenny Tullo in the sixth grade.

18:46.024 --> 18:49.225
Yeah, exactly like Kenny Tullo.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.196
Hey...

18:53.231 --> 18:54.998
See if you can kick one of those...

18:55.033 --> 18:57.300
one of those rocks loose.

19:25.762 --> 19:27.562
This is miles from their hotel.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.331
Yeah, why would Jamal
take David and Robbie

19:29.366 --> 19:30.698
so far off the beaten path?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.500
Where were they going?

19:33.737 --> 19:37.104
Makes me think they had some
sort of specific plan or agenda.

19:42.546 --> 19:44.045
Mae...

19:44.080 --> 19:45.312
I got a body.

19:52.621 --> 19:54.321
It's Jamal.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.109
Well, based on the
decomp, I would say that

20:01.155 --> 20:02.927
Jamal was killed 48 hours ago.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.307
Approximately the same time
David and Robbie went missing.

20:05.342 --> 20:07.409
Yeah. Jamal's carotid was severed.

20:07.444 --> 20:08.676
Mostly likely with a machete.

20:08.712 --> 20:10.512
This is someone with a lot of rage.

20:10.547 --> 20:13.248
And these defensive wounds
show that he fought back.

20:13.283 --> 20:15.683
All right, so did. The
gangsters that Jamal owed,

20:15.726 --> 20:18.095
did they get a lead
on him, track him down,

20:18.134 --> 20:19.009
and then just kill him?

20:19.072 --> 20:22.456
But why? They wanted
Jamal's money, not him dead.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.425
And setting that aside for a moment,

20:24.460 --> 20:25.827
why even take David and Robbie?

20:25.862 --> 20:27.194
They were witnesses.

20:27.230 --> 20:29.330
Why not just kill them on the spot?

20:29.365 --> 20:31.499
David and Robbie had
nothing to do with this.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.967
Why keep them alive at all?

20:33.003 --> 20:35.103
There is another option.

20:35.138 --> 20:37.939
Jamal brought them out here
looking for his own payday.

20:37.974 --> 20:39.039
He arranged for their kidnapping,

20:39.074 --> 20:39.940
sold them for ransom.

20:39.975 --> 20:42.042
But what happened, he's dead?

20:42.077 --> 20:43.210
Doesn't make any sense.

20:43.246 --> 20:45.812
Yeah, well, neither does the
idea that whoever attacked

20:45.848 --> 20:48.849
them took David and Robbie.

20:48.884 --> 20:51.418
What if Jamal wasn't the target?

20:52.821 --> 20:54.721
If this is about David and Robbie,

20:54.757 --> 20:57.624
this location is ideal for
some kind of snatch and grab.

20:57.660 --> 21:00.326
It's isolated, natural choke point.

21:00.362 --> 21:02.462
Yeah, he could have been spotted
anywhere and followed out here.

21:02.497 --> 21:04.865
Need to find out who ambushed him.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.567
Most of the street violence
here in Dhaka is pinned on

21:07.602 --> 21:10.236
the local warring games and
Mastaans, or crime bosses,

21:10.272 --> 21:12.972
including the recent
attacks on foreigners.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.507
Much like their North
American counterparts,

21:14.543 --> 21:17.577
they're into everything...
Human trafficking, alcohol,

21:17.612 --> 21:18.978
drugs, land grabbing.

21:19.013 --> 21:20.046
Hey, Jack.

21:20.081 --> 21:23.683
Monty, I know she's
pregnant, but I think we need

21:23.718 --> 21:25.818
to take Diane through
a cognitive interview.

21:25.853 --> 21:26.719
She'll do anything to help.

21:26.754 --> 21:28.420
She said she's tougher than she looks.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.922
Yeah, all mothers are.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.724
See if she can recall
the men who attacked them.

21:31.759 --> 21:34.894
We think that David
and Robbie, not Jamal,

21:34.929 --> 21:36.696
are the original targets.

21:36.731 --> 21:38.698
Hey, can you come in here, please?

21:38.733 --> 21:40.766
Why won't you help us?

21:40.802 --> 21:43.268
Please. He needs help.

21:43.304 --> 21:46.071
Quiet! Please.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.875
Run, David, run!

21:50.911 --> 21:52.578
- Now!
- Come on!

21:52.613 --> 21:53.612
- Go.
- I won't leave without you!

21:55.249 --> 21:57.015
Oh!

21:57.050 --> 21:59.084
Oh, Robbie, no!

22:02.388 --> 22:04.923
Ugh!

22:06.593 --> 22:07.826
No, no!

22:10.797 --> 22:14.199
And then Robbie yelled.

22:14.234 --> 22:17.435
And then they argued.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.637
Who? The attackers?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.721
We can take a break.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.157
No. No, I'm fine.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.514
Um...

22:41.577 --> 22:42.626
And then there was a third voice.

22:42.661 --> 22:43.961
And they kept saying...

22:46.165 --> 22:49.566
... "Dost Mehbani rahmat Karo."

22:49.601 --> 22:52.636
And then it got mu...

22:52.671 --> 22:54.604
Muffled, like they were...

22:54.640 --> 22:57.440
like they were dragging a Bo... a body.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.678
Oh, my God.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.670
Is...

23:02.741 --> 23:04.648
Is he dead because...

23:04.683 --> 23:05.482
Okay, deep breaths.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.784
- I can't.
- Deep breaths.

23:10.221 --> 23:13.689
We don't know what happened yet.

23:13.724 --> 23:15.992
We're gonna find him, okay?

23:16.027 --> 23:17.860
Yeah.

23:17.896 --> 23:18.995
Yeah.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.865
Simmons, Mae, see what kind of file

23:22.901 --> 23:25.301
the station has on Jamal
and find out when his family

23:25.336 --> 23:26.502
is supposed to arrive.

23:26.537 --> 23:29.471
We need to start narrowing
down some answers, and fast.

23:30.874 --> 23:33.403
Hey, Monty, tell us you
have something for us.

23:33.434 --> 23:36.845
Yeah, does the phrase,
"Dough Mehbani Rahmat care-o"

23:36.880 --> 23:39.047
or "Karo" mean anything to you?

23:39.082 --> 23:40.949
Diane recalled hearing
it in the argument.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.618
I tried to translate it to
Bengali, but nothing came up.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.987
"Dost meherbani rahmat Karo."

23:46.023 --> 23:47.055
It's an Urdu phrase.

23:47.090 --> 23:50.391
It means, uh, "Friend, have mercy."

23:50.427 --> 23:52.660
Sounds like they
weren't on the same page.

23:52.696 --> 23:55.197
If their abductors fought,
it suggests that this wasn't

23:55.232 --> 23:57.164
as organized as we originally thought.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.733
Well, it's also unusual.

23:58.768 --> 24:01.336
98% of the population
speak Bengali, not Urdu.

24:01.371 --> 24:03.838
So...

24:03.873 --> 24:06.341
is there...

24:06.376 --> 24:09.877
a particular neighborhood
in Dhaka that's home

24:09.912 --> 24:12.413
to a large Urdu-speaking population?

24:12.449 --> 24:15.216
In a city of 17 million that
used to be ruled by Pakistan,

24:15.251 --> 24:18.752
I'm sure there's more than a few.

24:18.787 --> 24:20.221
I know who can help us.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.692
I don't like reporters.

24:25.728 --> 24:26.560
We can't just sit around

24:26.595 --> 24:28.262
waiting for Sergeant Bhaduri to show up.

24:28.297 --> 24:30.864
We need local Intel.

24:30.899 --> 24:32.566
Monty could run a background on him.

24:32.601 --> 24:35.736
I already had him do it.

24:35.771 --> 24:37.704
Jeffery's clean.

24:37.740 --> 24:38.772
Well-respected.

24:38.807 --> 24:41.441
He's been stationed in Dhaka
for the past five years.

24:41.477 --> 24:44.177
Well, places like this
are information economies.

24:44.212 --> 24:45.912
It's all about who you
know, and I'm willing to bet.

24:45.947 --> 24:47.780
Jeffery knows who we
should be talking to.

24:47.815 --> 24:51.217
So what makes you think
he'll help us off the record?

24:51.253 --> 24:52.919
He'll help us.

25:03.398 --> 25:05.898
This isn't a social call, is it?

25:05.933 --> 25:08.434
Listen, we believe, the
Americans were abducted

25:08.469 --> 25:10.870
by a local gang...
Urdu-speaking with the means

25:10.905 --> 25:13.706
and the resources. To
grab and hold two adult men

25:13.741 --> 25:14.964
for a number of days.

25:15.027 --> 25:16.642
Look, I'm not looking to get involved

25:16.677 --> 25:17.810
in a criminal investigation.

25:17.845 --> 25:20.645
You'd rather stand back and
write about the aftermath?

25:20.680 --> 25:23.982
Trust is my most valuable
resource as a journalist.

25:24.018 --> 25:26.952
If I start bringing the FBI
to the doorstep of my assets,

25:26.987 --> 25:29.754
I could throw any credibility
I have out the window.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.390
People's lives are at stake.

25:31.425 --> 25:33.725
We are trying to prevent a
tragedy before it happens.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.894
I understand your dilemma,
but this isn't a game.

25:35.929 --> 25:37.261
These are people's lives.

25:37.297 --> 25:39.130
Look, I mean, you could start

25:39.165 --> 25:41.666
in the Banasri Ullah Para neighborhood.

25:41.701 --> 25:43.802
It's home to a large
Urdu-speaking population.

25:43.837 --> 25:46.304
No. We need more than that.

25:46.339 --> 25:47.839
There are roughly a million people

25:47.874 --> 25:48.907
in those few square blocks.

25:48.942 --> 25:52.243
Look, right now, there are
two men in grave danger.

25:52.278 --> 25:54.478
They both have families
back home that are praying

25:54.513 --> 25:56.447
for a miracle, and
they are counting on us.

25:56.482 --> 25:58.416
We don't have the luxury or time

25:58.451 --> 26:00.684
to worry about the future
or our damn credibility.

26:00.719 --> 26:03.587
What we need is Intel,
and we need it now.

26:04.723 --> 26:06.857
What you're asking is dangerous.

26:06.892 --> 26:08.492
I mean, gangs here are protected.

26:08.527 --> 26:09.960
They don't answer to anybody.

26:09.995 --> 26:12.763
We just want to have a conversation.

26:12.798 --> 26:15.531
Urdu-speaking gang, I mean...

26:15.567 --> 26:17.767
This is someone emboldened and brazen,

26:17.802 --> 26:19.268
willing to take risks.

26:19.303 --> 26:21.838
And they have resources, vehicles,

26:21.873 --> 26:23.806
and expectation of privacy.

26:23.842 --> 26:27.042
Do Tuppaki... Two Guns.

26:27.078 --> 26:28.878
Their leader, Aziz Ahmed

26:28.913 --> 26:30.713
doesn't have a
reputation without reason.

26:30.748 --> 26:32.948
Neither do I.

26:32.984 --> 26:35.017
They're not gonna like
a woman asking questions.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.218
And I'm not fluent.

26:36.253 --> 26:37.786
Call Simmons and have him meet us.

26:37.821 --> 26:40.155
In the meantime, help
Mae back at the station

26:40.191 --> 26:41.991
with Jamal's family.

26:42.759 --> 26:43.959
Hey...

26:43.995 --> 26:45.827
Thank you.

26:49.766 --> 26:52.734
If you think you can handle it...

26:52.769 --> 26:55.837
we could use a translator.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.747
In a conservative
country like Bangladesh,

27:06.782 --> 27:08.349
clubbing is frowned upon.

27:08.385 --> 27:11.352
So an underground culture of
daytime raves has sprung up.

27:11.388 --> 27:12.586
So you party in the afternoon,

27:12.622 --> 27:13.754
and then you're home by dinner.

27:13.789 --> 27:15.223
Yeah. I've got a lot of fond memories

27:15.258 --> 27:17.225
of similar parties back
in London when I was a kid.

27:18.128 --> 27:20.261
Speaking of which, can I ask you guys

27:20.296 --> 27:22.730
a question about Agent Seger?

27:22.765 --> 27:23.964
No.

27:35.636 --> 27:38.682
_

27:39.409 --> 27:41.120
_

27:53.185 --> 27:55.044
_

27:55.130 --> 27:57.348
_

28:00.164 --> 28:01.828
_

28:03.638 --> 28:05.838
Salaam alaikum.

28:06.808 --> 28:08.541
Tell him we have reason to believe

28:08.577 --> 28:10.376
he might be able to help us.

28:18.152 --> 28:20.652
He wants to know why he should help us.

28:20.688 --> 28:22.955
Ask him about the missing Americans.

28:28.028 --> 28:28.827
Hey!

28:28.862 --> 28:31.162
- Stop! Federal agent!
- Jack

28:31.198 --> 28:33.665
Jack! Jack!

28:33.701 --> 28:34.967
Police, freeze!

28:35.002 --> 28:36.001
Hands up!

28:36.036 --> 28:38.136
Stop! FBI!

28:38.171 --> 28:39.738
Come on, get up!

28:45.011 --> 28:46.435
Come on.

28:51.553 --> 28:53.245
I think you saw a couple of tourists,

28:53.334 --> 28:54.929
thought they'd make easy marks.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.217
Everything went as
planned, until your friend

28:57.297 --> 28:59.364
flew off the handle,
attacked their driver,

28:59.524 --> 29:00.772
and brutally killed him.

29:06.556 --> 29:08.556
Where did you see them?

29:14.631 --> 29:16.731
Do you think your buddy's in
there, taking the fall for you?

29:16.767 --> 29:18.224
No, no, no. He's in there
telling my boss right now

29:18.277 --> 29:20.344
this whole thing was your plan.

29:21.772 --> 29:26.140
You kill a man like that,
you can expect no mercy.

29:26.176 --> 29:27.541
We innocent.

29:27.576 --> 29:29.143
We want money.

29:29.179 --> 29:30.738
There is another man.

29:30.816 --> 29:33.283
He's... he's real killer.

29:33.318 --> 29:35.085
I tell him, "Have mercy."

29:35.120 --> 29:37.688
He said, "Take money, go."

29:37.723 --> 29:39.622
He wanted Americans.

29:39.657 --> 29:41.124
Wanted them for what?

29:41.159 --> 29:42.358
I... I don't know.

29:42.394 --> 29:43.693
Who was this other man?

29:45.397 --> 29:48.764
Never saw his face.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.133
But he must work at the factories.

29:52.337 --> 29:54.304
His fingers were stained with dye.

29:56.140 --> 29:57.306
He was crazy one.

29:59.210 --> 30:01.143
They didn't kill anyone.

30:01.178 --> 30:02.945
They thought they were gonna
roll a couple foreigners,

30:02.981 --> 30:04.146
make some quick cash.

30:04.181 --> 30:05.280
Yeah, these guys are just

30:05.316 --> 30:06.448
the neighborhood muscle, nothing more.

30:06.484 --> 30:09.218
Unlike the man who hired
them, they didn't have a plan.

30:09.253 --> 30:11.120
We spoke to Jamal's family.

30:11.155 --> 30:13.188
He borrowed the money to
start his own business,

30:13.224 --> 30:14.689
but he's not involved in any gangs.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.492
Yeah, David and Robbie
offered to help him.

30:16.527 --> 30:18.160
Jamal considered them friends.

30:18.195 --> 30:19.294
And on the night in question,

30:19.330 --> 30:20.795
he was taking them to see his family.

30:20.831 --> 30:23.198
David and Robbie were
the targets all along.

30:23.234 --> 30:25.000
Yeah, Jamal was just collateral damage.

30:25.035 --> 30:26.801
Found a body.

30:26.837 --> 30:28.637
It might be one of the Americans.

30:28.672 --> 30:31.305
Mae, Clara, go check it out.

30:31.341 --> 30:32.907
You want to come?

30:32.943 --> 30:36.177
Let's see if we can
I.D. the third attacker.

30:38.548 --> 30:40.749
Thank you. Come this way.

30:40.784 --> 30:42.183
He's right over here.

30:54.364 --> 30:57.265
It's Robbie.

30:57.300 --> 31:00.268
There is significant trauma here.

31:00.303 --> 31:02.369
Yeah, unlike Jamal.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.571
This unsub took his time with Robbie.

31:04.606 --> 31:07.107
It's definite overkill.

31:07.143 --> 31:09.409
Has a piece of cloth
jammed in his throat.

31:09.444 --> 31:11.011
He might have suffocated.

31:11.047 --> 31:13.246
I'm not gonna know more
until I can get a closer look.

31:13.282 --> 31:15.082
This doesn't bode well for David.

31:15.117 --> 31:16.516
No, it doesn't.

31:16.552 --> 31:18.851
Somebody must have seen something.

31:18.887 --> 31:20.353
Okay, I'm gonna take him back to the jet

31:20.389 --> 31:22.322
and perform the autopsy.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.093
Any luck with witnesses?

31:27.128 --> 31:29.296
No, we just got a lot of
doors slammed in our faces.

31:29.331 --> 31:30.330
People are afraid to talk.

31:30.365 --> 31:32.632
Well, we struck out on
I.D.ing our third suspect,

31:32.668 --> 31:33.933
but given the fact
that they were targeted

31:33.968 --> 31:36.135
and the violence, we think that
this was a personal vendetta.

31:36.171 --> 31:38.270
These were not the
cold, dispassionate kills

31:38.306 --> 31:40.272
you'd expect from an
opportunistic offender.

31:40.308 --> 31:41.808
Yeah, this is someone

31:41.843 --> 31:44.410
deeply aggrieved.

31:45.479 --> 31:46.378
Go ahead, Mae.

31:46.414 --> 31:48.915
So Robbie was killed by a single strike

31:48.950 --> 31:50.917
to his right anterior jugular.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.285
But he was clearly physically abused.

31:53.321 --> 31:55.621
He has bruising, suffocation,

31:55.656 --> 31:58.390
his left knee was deliberately crushed.

31:58.426 --> 32:00.092
Our unsub did a number on him.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.727
Yeah, and get this...

32:01.762 --> 32:03.295
Robbie's skin had traces

32:03.331 --> 32:06.265
of a particular
combination of chemicals.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.300
They're copper, dioxin,
and formaldehyde.

32:09.336 --> 32:11.770
And all three, when taken together,

32:11.805 --> 32:13.504
are used to dye clothes.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.472
According to Haamid and Uday,

32:15.507 --> 32:17.141
our unsub worked at the factories.

32:17.176 --> 32:18.508
He had dye on his hands.

32:18.544 --> 32:19.944
That must be where he spotted them.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.846
Yeah, Robbie's knee was crushed.

32:21.881 --> 32:24.248
He was beaten and suffocated.

32:24.283 --> 32:25.850
It sounds like the hazards of working

32:25.885 --> 32:27.251
in the ready made garment industry.

32:27.286 --> 32:29.153
You think David and
Robbie are surrogates,

32:29.188 --> 32:32.188
a way for our unsub to lash
out at a particular injustice?

32:32.224 --> 32:34.758
Our unsub did stuff a
shirt down Robbie's throat.

32:34.793 --> 32:36.526
It's the very thing that
they came here to buy.

32:36.562 --> 32:38.428
Yeah, businesses here are driven by

32:38.464 --> 32:41.097
Western clothing companies
outsourcing their labor.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.633
Workers make the lowest
wage in the world.

32:42.668 --> 32:44.501
In return, the work in
dangerous conditions.

32:44.536 --> 32:47.137
- Hey, Jack.
- Monty, what can you tell us

32:47.172 --> 32:49.538
about industrial
disasters here in Dhaka?

32:49.574 --> 32:51.374
We think a factory fire or cave-in

32:51.409 --> 32:52.508
was our unsub's stressor.

32:52.543 --> 32:55.444
Well, for one, accidents
are surprisingly common.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.680
It is pure negligence on
the part of the owners.

32:57.715 --> 33:00.349
Well, you say negligence, I say malice.

33:00.385 --> 33:02.518
These workers are treated
like they're more disposable

33:02.553 --> 33:04.052
than the $5.00 T-shirts they make.

33:04.088 --> 33:05.621
Our unsub's pain is fresh,

33:05.657 --> 33:07.523
so let's focus on recent accidents.

33:07.558 --> 33:12.027
Um, okay. There was a tannery
fire about six months ago.

33:12.062 --> 33:13.562
Balan Plaza.

33:13.598 --> 33:14.997
It was a mixed-use factory,

33:15.032 --> 33:16.732
home to a number of
Western clothing labels.

33:16.768 --> 33:18.634
Yeah, Balan Plaza.

33:18.670 --> 33:20.169
The building was over capacity,

33:20.204 --> 33:21.536
and the bottom three floors collapsed.

33:21.571 --> 33:22.604
But it didn't get a lot of coverage.

33:22.639 --> 33:25.340
The owner is well connected
and used his influence

33:25.375 --> 33:27.209
to play down the accident in the press.

33:27.244 --> 33:29.577
Yeah, dozens and dozens of
people were buried alive,

33:29.613 --> 33:31.579
but they suffocated because the rescuers

33:31.615 --> 33:32.915
didn't have time to dig them out.

33:32.950 --> 33:34.549
And some lost whole families.

33:34.584 --> 33:36.318
That sounds like the kind of trauma

33:36.353 --> 33:38.019
that would give rise to a revenge-driven

33:38.054 --> 33:39.487
angry retaliatory killer.

33:40.590 --> 33:42.524
He's making David and Robbie suffer

33:42.559 --> 33:43.692
like his family suffered.

33:43.727 --> 33:44.926
What happened to the building?

33:44.961 --> 33:46.861
It was condemned, isolated.

33:46.896 --> 33:48.596
They can't tear it down till
they figure out what to do

33:48.632 --> 33:49.664
with the toxic waste.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.766
Monty, we need an address
and building schematics.

33:51.802 --> 33:53.835
Coming your way A.S.A.P.

33:53.870 --> 33:56.003
- Thanks.
- I'd like you to come with us.

34:07.317 --> 34:10.551
Is that your family in those pictures?

34:10.585 --> 34:12.386
I have a family.

34:12.420 --> 34:15.688
I have a daughter on the way.

34:15.725 --> 34:17.591
Please let me get home.

34:17.626 --> 34:19.726
For my baby girl.

34:19.762 --> 34:21.628
A girl?

34:21.664 --> 34:22.696
Yeah.

34:22.732 --> 34:24.531
A baby girl.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.466
It's my first.

34:26.501 --> 34:27.533
I had girl.

34:33.675 --> 34:35.242
And I had wife.

34:48.690 --> 34:51.056
But no more.

34:51.092 --> 34:53.058
Tui guilty.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.594
Guilty?

34:54.629 --> 34:56.094
I... I... what?!

34:56.130 --> 34:58.664
Please, tell me what... What I can do.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.131
You are guilty.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.566
I must make right.

35:01.602 --> 35:03.502
No, I don't... I don't understand.

35:03.537 --> 35:05.136
I didn't do anything.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.406
Please, please.

35:07.610 --> 35:09.813
_

35:10.306 --> 35:11.876
_

35:13.547 --> 35:15.447
You are guilty.

35:15.482 --> 35:17.180
No.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.682
No.

35:30.029 --> 35:31.317
Stay close to me.

35:31.365 --> 35:33.138
Things are gonna move very quickly.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.132
I'll guide the
conversation, but remember,

35:35.167 --> 35:36.933
our unsub wants to be heard,

35:36.969 --> 35:39.836
he wants his pain to be legitimized.

35:42.074 --> 35:44.007
Please.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.144
Please, please!

35:49.047 --> 35:52.215
Put the weapon down!

35:52.250 --> 35:55.018
We know you're in pain.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.620
But you don't have to hurt this man.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.706
Put down your weapon.

36:07.031 --> 36:08.464
There's still time to make things right.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.632
This man here...

36:13.771 --> 36:15.238
... he's a journalist.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.373
He can tell your story.

36:28.785 --> 36:30.671
His wife and daughter were crushed.

36:31.688 --> 36:33.655
Because of him.

36:33.690 --> 36:37.058
People like him come to take.

36:37.093 --> 36:39.193
My family died, and for what?

36:39.228 --> 36:41.896
A cheap piece of cloth to make money?!

36:41.931 --> 36:42.930
Let us tell your story!

36:42.966 --> 36:43.765
Jeffery!

36:43.800 --> 36:46.333
Look, we can help you.

36:47.137 --> 36:49.370
Somebody must pay!

36:49.405 --> 36:50.738
- No!
- Don't do it!

36:53.884 --> 36:56.517
Stay down.

36:56.546 --> 36:59.513
- It's okay, you're safe.
- Thank you.

37:05.087 --> 37:06.187
Thank you.

37:06.222 --> 37:08.055
We're gonna get you out of here.

37:13.162 --> 37:16.863
So, how did things go with Jeffrey?

37:16.899 --> 37:17.731
What do you mean?

37:17.766 --> 37:20.901
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I mean.

37:20.936 --> 37:24.905
What, I thanked him, for
his time, and then I...

37:24.940 --> 37:26.206
gave him my card.

37:26.241 --> 37:29.375
In case he ever needs anything... ever.

37:29.411 --> 37:31.644
That's my girl.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.114
I can't believe Robbie's gone.

37:35.149 --> 37:38.117
He sacrificed himself for me.

37:38.152 --> 37:41.120
For my family.

37:41.155 --> 37:42.722
Well, he believed in you.

37:42.757 --> 37:44.424
Loved you.

37:44.459 --> 37:46.058
He'd want you to keep moving forward.

37:49.849 --> 37:51.348
David.

37:51.665 --> 37:53.733
I just got off with my office.

37:53.768 --> 37:56.468
Your wife has gone into labor.

37:56.503 --> 37:59.238
We're gonna get you
there as fast as we can.

38:03.043 --> 38:04.610
