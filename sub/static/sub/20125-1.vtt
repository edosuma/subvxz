01:39.475 --> 01:41.310

What is it?

01:48.067 --> 01:49.443
How'd you find me?

01:49.485 --> 01:53.823
You can't serve the leader
on an empty stomach.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.200
Aren't we doing all this
for food anyway?

01:57.326 --> 01:59.078
Does anyone know
you're here?

01:59.829 --> 02:02.665
Don't worry,
I reported to the captain.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.048
I hope it's seasoned properly.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.097

rest are with me.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.894

03:47.561 --> 03:49.146
Let's wait for backup.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.149
And watch the sunrise?

04:24.431 --> 04:25.766
Don't move!

04:27.184 --> 04:28.102
Clean it up.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.233
Freeze!

04:43.242 --> 04:45.119
Freeze, he said.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.620
I'll count to three.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.373
If you don't drop your guns,

04:50.165 --> 04:52.251
you'll get a bullet each
to the head.

One.

Two.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.136
I told you to standby.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.514
Do you ever listen?

05:07.266 --> 05:10.894
No need for bloodshed
among comrades.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.272
Lower your gun
and come down.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.650
We need a little face-to-face.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.113
Think about it.

05:21.322 --> 05:26.243
With these plates,
we could all live like kings.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.370
Am I right?

05:28.412 --> 05:29.747
Shut your mouth!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.001
Yeah?

05:36.420 --> 05:38.505
If I do, her head
will be blown off.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.507
Stop!

05:44.553 --> 05:45.888
Lower your gun.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.311
Rest of you too.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.986
Coming down?

06:22.674 --> 06:23.592
Take cover!

07:09.638 --> 07:12.391
Cheol-ryung, you okay?

07:15.519 --> 07:19.606
This may sound weird,
but I never liked you all.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.735
Censors are lapdogs,
loyal to the Republic.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.114
Rabid lapdogs.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.845
My graceful mercy...

07:51.889 --> 07:54.349
is the only reason
you get to live,

07:55.017 --> 07:57.227
and not because of
the leader you serve.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.733
I got a job for you,
go tell the Republic.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.445
I'm taking the plates
as the price of people's blood.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.074
See you.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.419
<i>North Korean Homeland Security</i>

08:25.464 --> 08:27.591
Created in Factory 215,
'The Supernote,'

08:27.633 --> 08:31.470
can perfectly replicate
all security measures,

08:31.470 --> 08:34.222
and can bypass any
counterfeit detection

08:34.264 --> 08:37.476
by the newest technology
available around the world.

08:37.601 --> 08:41.563
The engraved plates that are
used to print Supernotes

08:41.605 --> 08:46.318
were made by our best technicians
over the course of many years,

08:46.360 --> 08:47.319
and within 1 micrometer...

08:47.361 --> 08:49.321
I'm not here to hear you boast.

08:49.988 --> 08:50.822
Get to your point.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.952
The plates were stolen...

08:55.494 --> 08:57.704
After the counterfeit scandal
of 2010,

08:57.746 --> 09:00.707
we've denied
the existence of the Supernotes,

09:00.749 --> 09:04.711
but if these plates are
exposed, it would...

09:04.753 --> 09:05.587
Start a war.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.466
Party-sanctioned production
is like a declaration of war!

09:11.718 --> 09:15.514
Cha Gi-sung, age 44,
born in Hoeryong,

09:15.514 --> 09:19.518
deployed in Gulf War
as a weapons specialist,

09:19.518 --> 09:23.689
returned last September to
lead a special police squad.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.693
But he was demoted for stealing
drugs from the Republic.

09:27.734 --> 09:32.531
His wife was punished for
family liability and died in prison.

09:32.531 --> 09:35.951
It's presumed that he brought
his old squad together...

09:35.993 --> 09:37.202
Damn it.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.456
Ministry of Security has detected
his route out of the Republic,

09:41.498 --> 09:43.542
and he reached Chungdo
on the 12th.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.545
Passing through Beijing
and reached Dalian...

09:46.545 --> 09:49.548
China? Are you serious?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.800
Request their cooperation
to extradite him!

09:52.551 --> 09:56.930
We're in talks with MSS,
but China is just a stopover,

09:56.972 --> 10:00.559
and he boarded a plane
from Dalian today.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.810
The destination is...

10:03.562 --> 10:04.938
Seoul.

<i>CONFIDENTIAL ASSIGNMENT</i>

10:22.623 --> 10:25.167

10:33.592 --> 10:34.926
I said stop!

10:36.845 --> 10:38.055
Stop!

10:39.598 --> 10:40.599
You bastard!

10:44.478 --> 10:46.688

10:47.230 --> 10:50.609

to catch you.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.778
Come here, come here!

10:54.071 --> 10:55.656
Okay, okay, I won't go.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.284
Let's talk about this!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.538
Don't come close,
I'll slash you.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.540
I won't,
I said I won't!

11:05.582 --> 11:06.541
- Don't come.
- Never!

11:07.084 --> 11:11.630
<i>Daddy, answer the phone!
Don't pretend to be busy!</i>

11:12.589 --> 11:14.049
Can I answer my daughter?

11:15.717 --> 11:16.677
Go ahead.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.929
<i>Daddy, answer the phone!</i>

11:19.971 --> 11:20.931
Yes, sweetie.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.517
<i>- Daddy.</i>
- I'm working.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.685
<i>What about my iPhone?</i>

11:25.310 --> 11:26.269
iPhone?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.522
<i>You said you'd buy it!</i>

11:28.563 --> 11:29.898
<i>When will you buy me?</i>

11:33.443 --> 11:34.778
Let's be frank.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.697
Did you take bribes
from him?

11:36.697 --> 11:39.908
What bribe?
I would never!

11:39.950 --> 11:43.412
Then why call it in
after letting him go?

11:43.453 --> 11:46.289
I wasn't in a situation
to call in first.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.710
You worked so hard
to catch that bastard.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.045
You got your boys on
stakeouts for weeks.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.797
I know, I was on it too.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.676
Stop compromising.

11:59.678 --> 12:00.679
Say what?

12:01.430 --> 12:05.142
You can't leave our
conversation like that!

12:05.183 --> 12:07.144
Things are bad.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.147
Internal Affairs are
up my ass.

12:10.188 --> 12:13.024
I'll suspend you for 3 months
until things cool down.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.902
Really?

12:16.445 --> 12:20.699
He came after me with a knife,
I'm not a RoboCop!

12:21.575 --> 12:22.701
Chief Pyo!

12:27.456 --> 12:28.665
Det. Kang!

12:29.708 --> 12:32.627
You idiot, I told you to
call it in to the chief first.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.503
Why didn't you?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.714
I thought the arrest came first.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.383
You stupid idiot...

12:38.425 --> 12:40.010
This isn't the academy.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.887
I'll go talk to the chief, sir.

12:41.928 --> 12:42.888
What about?

12:43.805 --> 12:45.390
It was my mistake.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.142
Forget it, asshole.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.729
A rookie can't start out
with a strike.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.150
Go on in,
it's a done deal.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.027
It's part of being a cop.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.280
It's okay, go inside.

13:07.537 --> 13:11.249
So squad leader of District 12,
Cpt. Cha Gi-sung

13:11.666 --> 13:13.376
fled the country,

13:14.669 --> 13:19.633
but Major Lim Cheol-ryung
in his squad!

13:20.050 --> 13:21.760
Why were you kept alive?

13:26.681 --> 13:30.268
What's your plan with Cha?

13:31.686 --> 13:33.021
Kill me.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.234
If you don't,

13:38.777 --> 13:42.781
I'll go after Cha
to the cliffs of hell.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.370
Leave us.

13:55.836 --> 14:00.382
A North-South ministerial talk
will be held in Seoul next week.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.886
It's an unprecedented event
that we initiated.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.809
I'm going to include you
in the delegation.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.482
Go and capture Cha.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.494
I didn't take any bribes!

14:31.830 --> 14:35.250
Yeon-ah, my princess,
come here!

14:35.292 --> 14:36.501
Daddy, my iPhone!

14:36.543 --> 14:38.837
Okay, close the curtains.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.130
iPhone!

14:40.171 --> 14:43.884
When will you buy me?!
You promised!

14:43.884 --> 14:45.886
- When, when, when?!
- Okay!

14:45.886 --> 14:46.970
I'll buy it today!

14:47.012 --> 14:48.221
Today?

14:49.264 --> 14:50.223
Close the curtain, okay?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.893
- Mom said breakfast!
- I don't want any!

14:57.147 --> 14:59.983
Brother-in-law!
It's an emergency!

15:00.025 --> 15:01.610
What is it?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.737
I need $1,000 ASAP,
can I borrow it?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.740
Jesus, $1,000 is...

15:07.282 --> 15:08.992
Shush! Be quiet.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.369
I had a busy last month,

15:11.411 --> 15:12.746
so my cards are
all maxed out.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.373
Go talk to your sister!

15:16.291 --> 15:18.877
Bro, we're better than this.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.714
Talk to your sister!

15:23.882 --> 15:26.843
Send it to my account,
got it?

15:27.636 --> 15:28.970
What's going on here?

15:29.012 --> 15:32.891
Did you see his face?
He must be overworked.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.893
Be good to him,
I feel terrible for him.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.853
You must want something.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.230
Hey, hey, wake up.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.899
Hey, dumb-ass,
aren't you going to work?

15:40.941 --> 15:44.110
What's with you all today?!

15:44.152 --> 15:45.737
I'm off duty today!

15:45.779 --> 15:48.490
- It's Chief Pyo.
- I don't care!

15:48.907 --> 15:50.825
I'll take it then,
hello?

15:50.867 --> 15:51.910
- He won't answer...
- Give it!

15:51.910 --> 15:53.954
I knew you'd take it.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.080
Come eat breakfast!

15:55.121 --> 15:56.331
Don't want any.

15:56.998 --> 15:57.916
Hello?

15:59.918 --> 16:00.919
Good morning.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.087
Jin-tae!

16:03.922 --> 16:05.090
So much trash!

16:05.131 --> 16:06.341
- Why are you here?
- Let me help.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.592
Forget it.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.344
Are you rested?

16:09.386 --> 16:13.098
Like hell, I need to
look for a part-time job.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.934
15 years of partnership
means shit.

16:15.934 --> 16:16.977
This is what loyalty
is all about?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.938
I took easy on you
because of our loyalty.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.232
Remember how you lost
a suspect during a stakeout?

16:22.273 --> 16:24.567
And the missing $5,000
after the Ssangmun raid.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.319
You came to tell me that?

16:26.361 --> 16:27.988
Don't worry, really.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.949
I made sure there's
no strikes on your record.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.575
- Bullshit.
- Come on!

16:33.243 --> 16:34.202
Joint investigation?

16:34.869 --> 16:38.206
Heard about next week's
ministerial talk?

16:38.623 --> 16:42.002
Their delegation will
include a detective.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.004
A Censor Bureau agent.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.090
Anyway, there was a criminal
who defected to the South,

16:47.132 --> 16:48.842
and they want to
catch him themselves.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.220
What crime did he commit?

16:52.262 --> 16:53.722
I dunno.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.933
It's an order from
the commissioner.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.686
Everyone's going rabid
to take this case.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.312
But I managed to secure it.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.815
Cover their detective,
you'll get my support.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.569
You want me to babysit
a commie?

17:07.986 --> 17:09.988
- Don't call them that.
- Forget it!

17:10.864 --> 17:14.701
I worked towards a just society,
but I'm just a corrupt cop.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.578
But now you want me
to do what?

17:16.578 --> 17:19.955
How long must I sacrifice
for my country?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.586
You're hopeless,
you really are.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.462
What?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.838
You don't get it,
do you?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.425
I'm trying to get you back
in good graces.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.179
Forget it, I won't beg.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.806
If you don't want it,
I'll get the rookie.

17:36.848 --> 17:41.186
I haven't said no yet!

17:42.020 --> 17:45.023
And you can't trust
this detail to a rookie.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.816
Right, he's too inexperienced!

17:46.858 --> 17:49.319
- I'll think about it.
- Okay, good.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.822
So much trash...

17:52.864 --> 17:54.949
<i>Today at 12:50 PM..</i>

17:57.494 --> 18:00.080
Bro, pass me the remote.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.082
There, there.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.668
<i>Inter-Korean ministerial talks
will proceed...</i>

18:05.710 --> 18:07.921
- Hold on.
<i>- In Seoul for 3 days.</i>

18:08.213 --> 18:10.548
<i>After a long dormant period,</i>

18:10.590 --> 18:16.179
<i>the North Korea-initiated talk
is receiving much attention.</i>

18:16.221 --> 18:20.183
<i>With this case,
you'll get reinstated,</i>

18:20.225 --> 18:23.561
<i>and if it wraps well,
we'll all get promoted.</i>

18:23.603 --> 18:25.063
<i>Special promotion!</i>

18:25.063 --> 18:27.565
<i>Your salary will
get a boost too!</i>

18:27.607 --> 18:30.110
<i>When will we ever get
a chance like this?</i>

18:32.612 --> 18:33.822
Honey.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.158
Thanks for everything,
things will get better.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.409
What?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.538
Thanks for everything,
things will get better.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.667
Get it yourself,
it's in the fridge.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.670
Get what?
I'm thanking you.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.671
Out of the way!

18:49.712 --> 18:50.922
Why are you following me?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.675
I said it's in the fridge.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.427
No good,
we're no good.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.931
You've been investigated?

18:59.973 --> 19:03.101
Yes, that was
an administrative error.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.562
That case was
wrapped up nicely.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.064
He used to be a hot shot.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.066
Even got a commissioner award.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.653
He's an undercover specialist.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.115
That's why he's perfect
for this detail.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.910
In any case,
very good.

19:22.078 --> 19:28.293
Your task is to stay with
the North Korean detective 24/7,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.170
and report anything unusual.

19:30.211 --> 19:34.299
Chief Pyo, support him
in whatever ways you can.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.175
Of course.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.135
Like I said earlier,

19:37.135 --> 19:41.306
this is a joint and
a covert operation.

19:41.973 --> 19:45.268
<i>They mustn't know
the intelligence is involved.</i>

19:45.310 --> 19:47.770
<i>Not only the South,
but the North too.</i>

19:48.146 --> 19:50.023
<i>Do you understand?</i>

20:06.706 --> 20:11.169
Find Cha and
secure the plates.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.213
Did you learn to use
this hand phone?

20:14.172 --> 20:16.758
The South controls
the people with this.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.135
You may give up the gun,
but never this.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.182
<i>You only have 3 days.</i>

20:25.433 --> 20:28.019
<i>Look for Park Myung-ho first.</i>

20:28.436 --> 20:32.398
<i>He was one of Cha's men,
he's a smuggler in the South.</i>

20:32.440 --> 20:35.902
<i>He will lead you to Cha.</i>

20:37.070 --> 20:38.905
<i>Leave your personal vendetta
out of this.</i>

20:40.073 --> 20:41.157
<i>Don't forget.</i>

21:02.303 --> 21:04.222
What a stud.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.237
Aren't you Det. Lim?

21:19.237 --> 21:21.906
Welcome to the South,
nice to meet you.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.283
I'm Kang Jin-tae
from Homicide.

21:25.159 --> 21:29.247
North's weapon is confiscated
until the case wraps.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.250
That's rule #1 of
our joint detail.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.294
It's a property of the Republic,
give it back.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.255
That's the rule,
and you have to obey.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.757
When in Rome,
do as the Romans do.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.883
Let's move.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.983
Eat some.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.736
Our tax money is feeding you
to catch the criminal.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.112
Go on.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.283
<i>The South will assign
a snake to you.</i>

22:06.284 --> 22:09.746
<i>He cannot find out
about the plates.</i>

22:09.787 --> 22:12.623
<i>The North's target is
Cha Gi-sung,</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:16.502
<i>they wouldn't initiate a talk
and request a joint detail</i>

22:16.544 --> 22:20.882
for a petty killer,
at least that's our assumption.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.384
I've been at this for 20 years.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.762
I can read between the lines.

22:27.305 --> 22:30.308
I feel the weight
on my shoulders.

22:30.308 --> 22:34.604
I'll wrap this in the name of
South Korean detective.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.105
- Don't you worry.
- No...

22:37.273 --> 22:38.107
Sit, sit.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.860
We'll locate and arrest
Cha Gi-sung.

22:41.903 --> 22:45.740
Your job is to pretend
to cooperate fully,

22:45.782 --> 22:48.868
<i>and steer him away.</i>

22:51.287 --> 22:53.873
What brought you here?

22:54.040 --> 22:57.126
I read the dossier
on this joint case.

22:57.919 --> 23:02.757
An ordinary killer couldn't
initiate a North-South detail.

23:03.341 --> 23:07.387
Shouldn't you celebrate
that a killer defected?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.472
I certainly would.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.975
It just doesn't
make any sense.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.603
It doesn't have to,
just do your job.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.233
Is that so?

23:25.363 --> 23:28.366
That flag.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.368
If you leave it on...

23:35.373 --> 23:39.210
Rule #2,
this is a covert case.

23:39.252 --> 23:43.339
I wanted to give you
a heads up about the detail,

23:43.381 --> 23:44.966
but you twisted my arm!

23:45.633 --> 23:48.219
Good thing I suppressed myself,

23:48.261 --> 23:52.098
we could have started out
on a bad note.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.225
So embarrassing...

23:54.892 --> 23:56.102
Look around.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.729
South is full of CCTVs.

23:58.771 --> 24:03.985
There are over 3 million of them,
We're always being watched.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.403
So since we're...

24:05.778 --> 24:09.407
Right, the North is
always being watched too.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.451
I guess we're all the same.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.707
It's too early in the day
for these flyers.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.585
Hey.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.213
Ever seen one of these?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.465
Give them a call.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.344
Use this cell phone.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.222
I favorited my number.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.599
I got one too.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.226
You do?

24:38.019 --> 24:39.854
You can use this.

24:41.439 --> 24:42.857
Then what's your number?

24:43.274 --> 24:44.317
No need.

24:44.358 --> 24:48.446
Give it to me,
in case of emergency.

24:49.447 --> 24:50.823
Bastard...

24:55.369 --> 24:57.580
Take it back
when you return home.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.457
What do we do now?

25:00.875 --> 25:04.462
Anywhere you want to go?
Seoul Tower, or Itaewon?

25:04.462 --> 25:06.839
This might be your
last trip to Seoul.

25:07.632 --> 25:09.467
Are you really
a Special Investigator?

25:10.510 --> 25:13.513
Is that what you heard?
Yes, why you ask?

25:13.513 --> 25:16.224
You feel more like
a tour guide.

25:17.225 --> 25:19.477
You think I don't know
how to investigate?

25:19.519 --> 25:21.562
We have no clues to go on.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.484
My bosses are tracking
Cha's location,

25:26.526 --> 25:29.070
- so we need to standby...
- Go to Myeong-dong.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.824
You like shopping?
Okay, why not.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.506
Aren't you better off
as a soldier?

25:49.131 --> 25:50.299
Why a cop?

25:50.841 --> 25:52.510
Find another route,
one without traffic.

25:53.844 --> 25:57.306
I wish I could,
but there isn't one.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.809
GPS tells us the best route.

26:00.351 --> 26:04.564
For a country without any oil,
Why are there so many cars?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.443
Are the Southern cops
always like this?

26:09.527 --> 26:12.822
Yielding to all traffic,
playing with the hand phone

26:12.863 --> 26:14.073
while chasing a criminal?

26:15.491 --> 26:18.202
In Seoul, there's no way
out of a traffic jam.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.954
How do I get through that?

26:20.538 --> 26:23.457
That death stare of yours...

26:25.459 --> 26:27.545
I better make way.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.303
Only ambulances can do that.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.181
What were you saying?

26:39.223 --> 26:42.310
We're going to Myeong-dong
to look for a suspect?

26:45.730 --> 26:48.608
We're partners,
fill me in.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.614
Daemyung Condo, #1108.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.409
Cha's associate lives there.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.287
Park Myung-ho.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.669
That's all I needed to know.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.674
<i>Hostage situation
in Mapo district.</i>

27:14.216 --> 27:16.552
<i>A man in his 40s holding
a woman hostage with a knife.</i>

27:17.720 --> 27:21.307
What a world we're living in.

27:22.850 --> 27:27.313
D-1 is nearby,
we'll check it out.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.315
What are you doing?

27:29.357 --> 27:31.275
You heard the radio,
we got a hostage.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.402
Did you forget your orders?

27:33.694 --> 27:35.613
Where's your priority?

27:36.697 --> 27:39.533
A citizen's safety is
always a priority.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.410
If we don't go,
she could get stabbed...

27:41.952 --> 27:43.287
Stop this bullshit!

27:44.205 --> 27:46.165
Goddamn...

27:47.583 --> 27:49.293
You better let go of me.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.171
We're not close enough
for this level of intimacy!

27:53.714 --> 27:56.300
Okay, fine,
let's talk it over.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.928
Let go!

27:58.969 --> 28:00.638
Goddammit!

28:00.638 --> 28:02.306
Wait, okay, let go!

28:02.348 --> 28:03.641
Get out of the car.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.519
What do you take me for?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.689
All this twisting and
grabbing over nothing!

28:09.689 --> 28:12.650
If we weren't
assigned to...

28:15.820 --> 28:18.155
You're making a huge mistake.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.532
Give that back!

28:19.657 --> 28:21.033
Okay, fine, fine.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.410
Truce, ceasefire.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.704
Uncuff me and let's talk
like democratic people.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.665
Or like communists?

28:31.669 --> 28:34.422
Cheol-ryung, hey,
listen to me.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.048
Cheol-ryung!

28:36.674 --> 28:37.633
Hey, hey!

28:37.675 --> 28:38.676
Wait!

28:45.057 --> 28:46.016
Lim Cheol-ryung!

28:46.058 --> 28:47.017
What?!

28:47.435 --> 28:50.396
That's one crazy motherfucker!

28:50.438 --> 28:53.691
Even for a Special Forces,
he's going overboard!

28:55.943 --> 28:58.696
Det. Lee,
I need to track a taxi!

28:58.696 --> 29:00.906
19B6918.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.534
69-fucking-18!

29:33.606 --> 29:35.649
<i>Daemyung Condo</i>

29:36.066 --> 29:37.818
<i>Daemyung Condo #1108</i>

29:41.739 --> 29:42.782
Hey!

29:48.746 --> 29:50.498
You got here in one piece.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.250
Detective, let's have a chat.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.628
We need to talk!

29:55.795 --> 29:57.755
Why are you so gung-ho?

29:57.755 --> 29:59.799
No one investigates
on foot anymore.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.008
It's all about CSI.

30:01.759 --> 30:02.885
We need to talk about...

30:02.927 --> 30:04.637
how we deal
with the suspect...

30:28.285 --> 30:31.622
Det. Lee, 31S2914!

30:31.664 --> 30:33.624
Myeong-dong to Jongro!

30:33.916 --> 30:36.502
Call me when you track it!

30:41.799 --> 30:42.883
Made in the North?

30:42.925 --> 30:44.635
Commonly known

30:45.177 --> 30:46.387
as 'ice'.

30:46.679 --> 30:50.474
Asshole, whether it's Chinese
or North Korean,

30:50.808 --> 30:51.851
one large per kilo
is too much!

30:53.811 --> 30:56.814
It's not the fake shit
that you get here,

30:56.814 --> 31:00.734
it's the authentic, genuine
North Korean ice.

31:00.818 --> 31:01.819
Look here.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.821
You lived too long
with the fake shit.

31:05.155 --> 31:09.618
The dirty and ragged defector
has all grown up.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.245
You're just a drug fiend chaser.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.874
Give it to him.

31:18.836 --> 31:21.130
It's all there, asshole.

31:23.841 --> 31:24.842
Oh yeah.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.888
Let me know if you're
in the market for these.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.224
I don't only deal drugs.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.101
Lots of stuff.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.487
Park Myung-ho.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.241
Where's Cha Gi-sung?

31:49.283 --> 31:50.242
Arm!

31:53.037 --> 31:53.996
My arm!

31:57.917 --> 31:59.585
Who are you?

31:59.627 --> 32:00.878
Does this look fake?

32:01.253 --> 32:02.588
It'll blow your head off.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.472
Lim Cheol-ryung!

33:14.243 --> 33:16.704
- Where?
<i>- Itaewon!</i>

33:16.745 --> 33:17.454
Itaewon?

34:28.108 --> 34:30.319
Back off! Now!

34:32.987 --> 34:34.322
- Ha-young!
- Daddy!

34:35.114 --> 34:36.033
Come here!

34:45.042 --> 34:46.043
Ha-young!

34:46.460 --> 34:48.420
- You okay?
- Daddy!

34:53.842 --> 34:56.053
Look at this...

34:57.596 --> 34:59.056
Lim Cheol-ryung!

35:03.977 --> 35:05.062
Stop!

35:06.105 --> 35:07.439
Goddammit!

35:18.117 --> 35:19.284
I got a hit!

35:22.204 --> 35:27.793
Dalian A257 on the 18th
under the alias 'Hwang Wui-wan.'

35:28.127 --> 35:30.170
Search the exit gate.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.296
Okay.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.100
- Check that car!
- Yes, sir.

36:10.711 --> 36:12.171
Park's here, sir.

36:13.714 --> 36:14.673
Park Myung-ho reporting.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.426
Aren't you sick of it?
Stop saluting.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.928
It's a free country.

36:21.138 --> 36:23.140
The boat and weapons
will be ready tomorrow.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.391
Good.

36:25.142 --> 36:27.186
But we got a problem.

36:28.061 --> 36:31.899
He must be from the homeland,
he's searching for you.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.526
Probably from Facility #5014.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.154
There were two.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.657
The South Korean called him
'Lim Cheol-ryung.'

36:51.835 --> 36:52.920
Have you gone mad?!

36:53.170 --> 36:55.297
Why not tell the world
about this covert detail?

36:55.839 --> 36:57.507
I could've gotten killed!

36:58.175 --> 37:00.761
When I caught up to Lim,
he was in an action film.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.389
Then a kid jumped out,
and she could've gotten killed!

37:04.431 --> 37:06.141
- I jumped for her...
- Okay, forget it.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.517
What about Park?

37:07.559 --> 37:10.020
He fled, he was long gone.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.774
You let him flee?
You didn't interrogate?

37:14.191 --> 37:15.776
You wanted me to do that?

37:15.817 --> 37:18.153
I don't believe it...

37:19.947 --> 37:22.658
We got Cha Gi-sung's dossier.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.409
He's a North Korean officer.

37:25.202 --> 37:29.414
Stay on Lim 24/7,
don't let him cause trouble!

37:30.290 --> 37:33.001
But 24/7 is a bit...

37:33.043 --> 37:34.753
No, take him home
and sleep with him!

37:35.212 --> 37:38.632
This could be
an exile of a VIP.

37:38.674 --> 37:43.637
Imagine what'd happen
if Lim finds him first?

37:43.679 --> 37:45.514
And assassinates him
while on this joint detail?

37:45.931 --> 37:47.266
We'd be so fucked.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.231
Did you give him
the phone?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.233
He wants to use his.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.280
What?

38:01.947 --> 38:03.991
You should've
given it to him!

38:04.283 --> 38:10.247
He knows he'll be tracked!
How can I force him?!

38:11.164 --> 38:12.499
Dammit...

38:14.251 --> 38:15.252
Where's Lim?

38:20.257 --> 38:21.758
Det. Lim?

38:23.427 --> 38:25.387
I'm Det. Lee Dong-hoon.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.015
I'm Det. Kang's partner.

38:28.932 --> 38:32.019
In other words,
We're on the same team.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.396
Good to meet you.

38:36.189 --> 38:40.861
Our countries may be divided,
but we share the same blood.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.989
As a joint detail,
we can wrap this up nicely...

38:44.031 --> 38:47.242
That'd be nice,
wrapping it nicely.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.119
- Nothing to report.
- It'd be weird, if you did.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.371
Jesus...

38:51.413 --> 38:52.748
Let's go out.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.875
Come.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.501
What will you do now?

38:57.544 --> 39:01.131
Park's gone
and no break on Cha.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.508
Will you go door-to-door?

39:03.925 --> 39:07.387
That'd only take 50 years.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.765
If you had not interfered,
I could've had him.

39:09.806 --> 39:10.974
Come on.

39:13.769 --> 39:15.103
This way.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.857
You lost the suspect,
and terrorized the streets.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.317
How's that a covert op?
Get in.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.330
Your legs, please.

39:33.413 --> 39:36.625
I'll hop over,
move your legs.

39:41.338 --> 39:42.381
Spread them a bit.

39:43.632 --> 39:44.841
Too much!

39:44.883 --> 39:45.967
Legs together...

39:57.354 --> 39:58.355
Hold on...

39:58.355 --> 39:59.731
I'm getting sweaty.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.234
Holy cow...

40:06.780 --> 40:09.991
When will this day ever end?

40:14.162 --> 40:18.375
Detective, this is
hard for me too.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.710
Can't we trust each other?

40:20.752 --> 40:23.964
We're partners
for a little while.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.383
We have to catch
Cha together.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.969
We can triangulate him
right away.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.722
Don't underestimate
the power of our reach.

40:32.764 --> 40:36.226
If you find him,
let me know first.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.727
If you do that,

40:39.438 --> 40:41.481
I'll follow South Korean
investigation rules.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.110
That's what I'll do.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.404
Uncuff me.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.449
And run off on your own?

40:50.490 --> 40:52.075
I want to trust
our joint detail.

40:55.412 --> 40:59.416
I got so much shit
from the top because of you.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.586
Let's stop being so formal.

41:03.003 --> 41:08.592
I noticed that you're
much younger than I am.

41:08.633 --> 41:12.429
I usually share a drink
and become friends.

41:12.429 --> 41:14.848
Let's do that, okay?

41:15.640 --> 41:16.725
Alright.

41:16.766 --> 41:19.478
That was unexpectedly easy.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.854
Very good.

41:21.271 --> 41:24.691
As a commemoration of
our new friendship, here.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.569
Show me your leg.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.449
Very nice.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.494
That device is,

41:36.495 --> 41:40.707
it's a discreet sign
that you're a detective here.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.587
Isn't this a GPS tracker?

41:45.629 --> 41:47.964
There is a small function
like that.

41:48.465 --> 41:50.467
How do I explain this?

41:51.885 --> 41:53.595
Let's say you arrive
at a crime scene.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.722
You can't tell who's who.

41:55.764 --> 41:59.476
Then a man comes over
and asks who you are.

41:59.476 --> 42:01.561
'Me? Take a look.'

42:02.479 --> 42:05.815
'You're a detective?'

42:06.107 --> 42:07.943
'Yes, I am. And you?'

42:07.984 --> 42:09.569
Then you see his.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.489
'You're a detective too?
Great work here.'

42:12.489 --> 42:14.491
We are one,
we are comrades.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.327
That's what that represents, okay?

42:17.369 --> 42:19.204
Then where's yours?

42:20.872 --> 42:24.084
Mine's being charged.
I wear it everyday.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.335
Allow me.

42:26.628 --> 42:29.464
I will gladly accept,
thank you.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.049
I'll return the favor.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.052
- Take a shot.
- I'm okay.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.514
Have just one drink.

42:39.474 --> 42:43.562
Since we're on this detail,
it's game over for the bad guys.

42:44.521 --> 42:48.567
If I catch Cha,
what'll you do for me?

42:48.608 --> 42:50.318
What would you like?

42:50.735 --> 42:53.530
Let me think,
anything in the world?

42:53.530 --> 42:56.533
Give me just $100K.

42:56.616 --> 43:00.579
I can send my kid
to a private prep school,

43:00.620 --> 43:05.292
marry my sis-in-law off,
and give the rest to my wife,

43:05.333 --> 43:08.587
and say 'Buy a bigger house',
what do you think?

43:10.213 --> 43:15.927
That's chump change for
slaving Korea's finest for 3 days.

43:15.969 --> 43:17.804
Do you know
What my hourly pay is?

43:18.555 --> 43:21.182
You'll be shocked
to hear it.

43:22.225 --> 43:27.689
After taxes,
about $38,000.

43:27.731 --> 43:30.942
Divide that by 12,

43:31.484 --> 43:33.570
then it's about $3,000.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.947
Divide that by 30,

43:37.073 --> 43:41.578
Damn, that's like
minimum wage!

43:41.620 --> 43:43.163
Good evening, ma'am.

43:46.583 --> 43:49.044
Honey, we got a guest.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.587
Come in, come in,

43:50.587 --> 43:52.589
he's my new partner.

43:52.589 --> 43:53.673
Handsome, right?

43:54.841 --> 43:57.302
He hasn't got a room yet.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.596
So I told him he could
stay with us for a bit.

43:59.721 --> 44:03.808
He insisted that we buy
something you like,

44:04.225 --> 44:05.560
so he got fried chicken.

44:06.478 --> 44:07.937
This is my wife!

44:07.979 --> 44:09.689
And my princess.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.026
How was your day?

44:13.610 --> 44:15.403
- Whose daughter?
- Mom's, of course.

44:15.445 --> 44:16.613
When will you
become mine?

44:18.448 --> 44:21.618
Say hello to Mr. Lim.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.161
Good evening.

44:24.621 --> 44:26.665
- Hello there.
- What is it?

44:26.706 --> 44:29.042
You could've got him
a motel.

44:29.626 --> 44:31.544
Dumb!
And dumber!

44:31.961 --> 44:33.546
He can hear you.

44:33.630 --> 44:36.675
You can't talk about him
when he's standing here.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.677
So what?

44:42.639 --> 44:43.682
Come inside, come!

44:43.682 --> 44:45.892
It's okay, come in.

44:46.309 --> 44:47.644
We live like this.

44:47.811 --> 44:50.689
I'm the head of this family,
make yourself at home.

44:50.814 --> 44:52.649
Says who?!

44:52.649 --> 44:54.776
You're being rude
to our guest!

44:54.818 --> 44:56.778
That woman...

44:56.820 --> 45:00.281
She's got a sharp tongue,
but she's kind.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.658
Please come in,
it's okay.

45:02.075 --> 45:05.161
I wouldn't have invited you
otherwise. Come on in and wash it.

45:19.676 --> 45:21.010
He's so hot...

45:21.678 --> 45:22.679
Is he in there?

45:23.722 --> 45:24.681
Yeah, why?

45:27.726 --> 45:29.519
What, what?!

45:31.062 --> 45:32.397
He's not getting
the master bedroom!

46:02.051 --> 46:05.638
You can sleep here,
it's Yeon-ah's room.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.724
I hope it's not
too uncomfortable.

46:07.724 --> 46:10.727
If you need anything,
please let me know.

46:11.728 --> 46:12.771
This is my room.

46:14.731 --> 46:15.774
My room...

46:18.193 --> 46:19.402
Have a good night.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.383
Once we locate Cha,

46:42.425 --> 46:44.761
I'll abandon the detail
and go dark.

46:44.761 --> 46:46.888
<i>Remember, you got
48 hours left.</i>

46:47.555 --> 46:50.266
<i>If you can't secure the plates,
destroy them.</i>

46:50.308 --> 46:52.018
I will risk my life
for this mission.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.611
I hope you like it,
I made this for you.

47:02.403 --> 47:03.613
Please try it.

47:04.656 --> 47:06.741
Do you have any favorites?

47:06.783 --> 47:10.620
If you have any requests,
feel free to let me know.

47:10.662 --> 47:13.122
Listen to her.

47:13.164 --> 47:16.793
I've never seen you cook
anything in the last 3 years.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.127
He's a guest, sis.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.255
I hope it's to your liking.

47:20.296 --> 47:23.132
Don't worry,
I'm not a picky eater.

47:24.676 --> 47:25.635
North Korean?

47:28.429 --> 47:32.225
He defected because
it's hard to live there.

47:32.267 --> 47:35.603
He's a North Korean cop,
so be nice to him.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.481
Yeon-ah, eat this.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.234
- Whose daughter?
- Mom's.

47:42.819 --> 47:44.863
Good girl.

47:46.406 --> 47:47.866
Huh, it's for him?

47:48.032 --> 47:49.826
Nothing for me?

47:49.826 --> 47:51.119
So kind.

47:51.828 --> 47:53.621
It'd be nice to
give me some too.

47:53.663 --> 47:54.831
You eat plenty.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.000
Please dig in.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.503
No need for back and forth,

48:00.545 --> 48:03.006
there's enough food
in the South.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.090
So insensitive.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.885
Who starves to death nowadays.

48:07.010 --> 48:09.846
Get with the times,
go read some papers.

48:10.013 --> 48:11.848
There are plenty.

48:11.848 --> 48:14.475
Don't mind your
brother-in-law.

48:14.517 --> 48:15.602
What?

48:15.643 --> 48:16.728
He's right here.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.856
- Don't mind him.
- Don't listen to him.

48:19.856 --> 48:21.482
Daddy's bad.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.734
- Bad!
- So bad!

48:22.859 --> 48:24.861
Not all North Koreans
are starving.

48:24.861 --> 48:25.987
It depends on the person.

48:27.155 --> 48:30.742
He's not the starving kind,
look at his perfect skin.

48:30.783 --> 48:31.868
Huh?

48:31.868 --> 48:33.870
Allow me to apologize
on his behalf.

48:33.870 --> 48:35.246
He's like that.

48:35.288 --> 48:37.874
Stop staring at him,
eat your breakfast.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.709
Go on, eat.

48:39.751 --> 48:40.960
- Please eat.
- We need to go.

48:41.002 --> 48:42.337
Have some.

48:42.879 --> 48:43.838
Go ahead.

48:44.923 --> 48:47.967
My wife is a great cook.

48:48.760 --> 48:51.596
- Boss, we got the car owner.
- I'll call you back.

48:51.888 --> 48:52.889
Go on.

48:52.889 --> 48:54.098
His name is Jang Sung-tae,

48:54.140 --> 48:55.725
COO of DS Holdings.

48:55.767 --> 48:56.893
DS Holdings?

48:56.893 --> 48:59.228
Yes, it's a sister company
of DS Resort and Hotel.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.856
CEO Yoon Dae-hyub
is a Chinese migrant,

49:01.898 --> 49:03.900
and he's known as
the Korean boss of the Triad.

49:05.944 --> 49:08.363
Put our men on
Yoon and Jang.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.323
Report when they contact Cha.

49:21.376 --> 49:23.836
How do you like free life?

49:23.878 --> 49:25.588
Are you comfortable here?

49:25.922 --> 49:28.716
I sleep and eat well
as a free man.

49:29.384 --> 49:32.470
If you have the money,
freedom can easily be bought.

49:33.638 --> 49:37.850
Left and right wings
don't really exist.

49:37.934 --> 49:40.937
But there is top and bottom,
those with and without.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.564
Let's cut the chitchat,

49:43.606 --> 49:44.941
and get to the point.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.824
Come on, this doesn't
prove shit.

49:52.865 --> 49:54.575
I have to see the plates
printing the cash.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.704
We're not dealing
petty sum here.

49:59.122 --> 50:01.082
Let's see what
the plates can do.

50:01.499 --> 50:04.585
We gotta make sure
it's genuine as well.

50:05.003 --> 50:06.587
What do you take me for?

50:06.963 --> 50:09.716
Counterfeit detection
has advanced quite a bit.

50:10.508 --> 50:13.845
We need specialists
and equipment too.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.014
I don't have a lot of time.

50:16.014 --> 50:17.432
I just need 2 days.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.810
Whether we verify or not
is up to you.

50:21.227 --> 50:24.313
But this deal
is up to me.

50:24.981 --> 50:26.441
You got balls.

50:28.234 --> 50:29.569
Son of a bitch.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.578
Mr. Yoon.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.456
I betrayed my country,

50:41.873 --> 50:45.460
my family and my youth
for these plates.

50:47.754 --> 50:50.548
Do you want my organs too?

50:51.007 --> 50:54.427
You worked so hard,
you deserve to get paid.

50:55.720 --> 50:59.307
I'm the only one who has
the resources anyway.

51:01.017 --> 51:02.310
Right.

51:04.353 --> 51:06.064
Then I shall wait.

51:06.481 --> 51:08.066
You get 24 hours.

51:08.107 --> 51:12.445
Bring your specialists,
and whatever you need.

51:12.862 --> 51:15.573
We'll meet back here
tomorrow with the plates.

51:15.865 --> 51:17.950
Very wise.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.577
But you also get a warning.

51:20.870 --> 51:23.664
If you fuck around,
I will kill you.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.420
Rewind, please.

51:29.462 --> 51:30.421
Stop!

51:30.463 --> 51:32.298
Where is that man going?

51:33.466 --> 51:34.926
To the basement.

51:34.967 --> 51:36.177
What's there?

51:36.219 --> 51:38.429
A duty-free shop,
but it's not open yet.

51:39.055 --> 51:40.306
- Duty-free shop?
- Yes.

51:40.348 --> 51:42.058
- Thank you.
- No problem.

51:42.725 --> 51:46.062
We can't barge in
without evidence.

51:46.479 --> 51:48.815
Park is carrying
a different bag.

51:48.856 --> 51:51.442
That can happen,
so what?

51:52.485 --> 51:53.444
What?

52:02.078 --> 52:06.082
Down here, suspects are
innocent until proven guilty,

52:06.082 --> 52:08.793
so they're free until
he's convicted.

52:08.835 --> 52:11.045
You have to follow our laws.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.672
I'm not your kind.

52:15.716 --> 52:20.805
So I have to take point
to make things legit.

52:22.098 --> 52:24.058
Good day.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.102
- Let me ask you something.
- What is it?

52:26.978 --> 52:30.273
We're here for Park Myung-ho,
he was here around 3PM yesterday.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.399
You know him, right?

52:31.941 --> 52:35.111
The one with fat head
and weird hair.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.782
We saw him on security cams,
so don't play dumb...

52:41.325 --> 52:42.410
Why is he here?

52:42.451 --> 52:43.786
Buddy!

52:43.828 --> 52:46.664
Knife swinger, you know me,
come over here.

52:46.706 --> 52:48.541
- Goddammit!
- Come here!

52:49.125 --> 52:50.293
Get back here, asshole!

52:50.835 --> 52:51.794
Boss, it's bad!

52:52.128 --> 52:53.796
Over here!

52:53.838 --> 52:56.799
Boss, boss!
That hurts!

52:56.841 --> 52:57.800
It really hurts!

52:57.842 --> 53:01.137
What is this place?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.266
What's going on here?

53:05.308 --> 53:08.644
The government granted you
to setup an honest shop,

53:08.686 --> 53:11.522
aren't these all fakes?

53:11.564 --> 53:14.150
Yo, who are you?

53:14.692 --> 53:16.277
Are you the boss here?

53:17.195 --> 53:19.530
I'd like to ask you
for your cooperation.

53:20.448 --> 53:22.200
Do you know Park Myung-ho?

53:23.159 --> 53:24.660
Did you bring a warrant?

53:25.328 --> 53:28.164
It's being mailed out,
but we can talk it over.

53:28.456 --> 53:31.292
You skipped due process
and came without one?

53:32.084 --> 53:34.545
You got shit for
common sense.

53:35.171 --> 53:36.297
Mr. Po-po.

53:36.714 --> 53:40.176
Are we already starting off
on the wrong foot?

53:40.218 --> 53:41.886
Det. Lim.

53:41.928 --> 53:45.014
Do I deserve
this kind of treatment...

53:48.059 --> 53:49.018
Is this real?

53:49.060 --> 53:50.519
Don't joke around
and give it back.

53:51.062 --> 53:53.147
Give it, asshole!

53:53.439 --> 53:55.191
- Give it back!
- You got no power here.

53:55.233 --> 53:57.902
You can't do shit
without a warrant.

54:00.238 --> 54:01.656
Where's Park?

54:01.697 --> 54:04.283
You got a way with that suit.

54:04.325 --> 54:05.284
I won't ask twice.

54:06.953 --> 54:10.206
You got terrible manners.

54:10.289 --> 54:12.375
What if I don't talk?

54:13.209 --> 54:15.878
Obstruction of justice
is an applicable law.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.880
If you do not cooperate
with the law...

54:20.216 --> 54:22.134
we can take
appropriate action.

54:24.929 --> 54:26.138
Boss!

54:27.223 --> 54:28.391
A detective

54:28.432 --> 54:32.144
is not a "po-po," but an official
who carries out the law.

54:32.436 --> 54:34.397
You must treat him accordingly.

55:23.779 --> 55:25.239
Bastards...

55:29.285 --> 55:30.494
Is that toilet paper?

55:31.412 --> 55:33.497
Back home,
toilet paper isn't a weapon.

55:34.290 --> 55:38.627
It's used to wipe butt
down here, not kick butt.

55:40.421 --> 55:42.882
How did you...

55:43.341 --> 55:46.010
They were coming at me,
it was self-defense.

55:46.052 --> 55:49.013
Yeah, you had that right,
but this is...

55:49.930 --> 55:52.350
Park's number is on it,
track his location.

55:58.314 --> 55:59.357
<i>Chief.</i>

55:59.774 --> 56:03.110
Can you drop me
from this detail?

56:03.152 --> 56:05.321
Do you know
What happened just now?

56:06.530 --> 56:10.493
Lim knocked out
a bunch of huge henchmen

56:10.534 --> 56:14.747
with a roll of toilet paper,
in a flash.

56:15.915 --> 56:16.999
What?

56:18.542 --> 56:19.627
The Triad?

56:19.794 --> 56:23.839
DS Holdings is
a corporate gang,

56:24.340 --> 56:28.344
and Cha got in touch with them
after landing here.

56:28.886 --> 56:30.096
<i>- Seriously?</i>
- Yeah.

56:31.347 --> 56:34.600
Did you really plant a bug
in Lim's cell phone?

56:35.142 --> 56:36.727
I did!

56:36.769 --> 56:39.105
<i>Then how come
we get no signal?</i>

56:39.772 --> 56:41.607
How should I know?

56:45.027 --> 56:46.112
Jin-tae.

56:47.279 --> 56:48.739
Let's solve this first.

56:48.781 --> 56:52.493
Why Cha defected,
the Triad and his goal.

56:52.535 --> 56:56.414
<i>We could be getting so much
more than a promotion.</i>

56:56.414 --> 57:00.584
<i>Leech some intel from Lim,
the agency is clueless.</i>

57:00.626 --> 57:02.461
I got it, sir.

57:03.629 --> 57:06.340
Okay, listen,
I got Park's location.

57:06.382 --> 57:07.842
Yeongdeungpo district,
66 Dosin St.

57:07.883 --> 57:09.343
<i>We're on our way too.</i>

57:09.385 --> 57:11.387
<i>When you get Park,
hand him over,</i>

57:11.429 --> 57:12.596
<i>we'll interrogate him.</i>

57:12.638 --> 57:16.350
<i>You better stay focused.</i>

57:16.434 --> 57:21.105
<i>Due to low unemployment rate,
more youths are relying on...</i>

57:21.147 --> 57:23.107
l-low much does
your husband make?

57:25.151 --> 57:28.737
After taxes, insurance,
just over $30,000.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.406
- $30,000?
- Yeah.

57:30.406 --> 57:32.074
That's it?

57:32.116 --> 57:33.951
It's more than enough.

57:33.993 --> 57:36.328
We live off that,
and paid for your college.

57:36.495 --> 57:40.207
Career men with $100K+
salary are lining up for me,

57:40.416 --> 57:45.087
it's a step back to marry
a cop with $30K income.

57:46.005 --> 57:47.840
A major downgrade, right?

57:48.632 --> 57:50.092
Did he propose to you?

57:50.134 --> 57:52.094
If I want to,
of course he will.

57:52.428 --> 57:53.846
Sis, I'm Park Min-young.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.973
So what?

57:56.390 --> 57:58.350
You're just a freeloader.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.436
Where did you get
that dress from earlier?

58:00.644 --> 58:03.230
I lost count
because of you!

58:03.272 --> 58:05.941
Focus on getting a job
and moving out.

58:05.983 --> 58:09.487
- Whatever! Stop!
- Not whatever!

58:09.487 --> 58:12.490
So why does he have to
be so hot? I can't decide.

58:12.865 --> 58:14.492
Why are you so fixated
on looks?

58:14.492 --> 58:17.328
And you really weren't.
I was so shocked.

58:18.496 --> 58:22.458
I was shocked too,
almost fatal, right?

58:23.459 --> 58:25.336
Totally fatal.

58:25.878 --> 58:29.965
<i>...crashed info a truck,
it was a dangerous scene.</i>

58:30.508 --> 58:32.718
<i>- Their recklessness...</i>
- It's him!

58:34.011 --> 58:34.970
Sis, sis!

58:35.513 --> 58:37.306
Isn't that Cheol-ryung?

58:38.849 --> 58:40.809
<i>...even engaging in a fist fight...</i>

58:40.851 --> 58:43.312
My god, oh no!

58:43.354 --> 58:46.815
Jesus Christ!
No way!

58:46.857 --> 58:48.484
Don't even think about it!

58:48.484 --> 58:50.069
He's so hot!

58:50.110 --> 58:54.573
Seriously!
Are you nuts?

59:00.120 --> 59:02.581
The magazine won't
fit in properly.

59:02.998 --> 59:04.333
Please wait here.

59:04.375 --> 59:07.086
Park could have
another exit route.

59:07.378 --> 59:09.338
No way, how could I trust...

59:14.218 --> 59:15.511
Goddammit...

59:17.596 --> 59:19.181
Not that I don't trust you,

59:19.515 --> 59:23.435
it's better to move
as a team.

59:30.985 --> 59:32.444
Hello there.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.920
Is this it?

59:53.340 --> 59:55.551
- What is it?
- I'm a cop.

59:56.093 --> 59:59.555
So damn smokey...

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.807
What's this place?

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.910
- Let's move.
- Lieutenant.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:28.417
Can't I just live
down here for good?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.589
I made all preparations,
got the guns and the boat.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.176
I don't need my cut,

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:41.680
so please tell
the captain for me.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:57.404
Hey!

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.618
What?

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:05.037
Who are you?

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:10.167
Are you the boss here?
Who are you?

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:11.418
Why are you here?

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.630
I'm looking for
Park Myung-ho.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.924
Out, get out.

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.638
Look at these guys...

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:26.642
Lim, they're
underestimating you.

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:28.143
You should teach...

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.396
Hey, Cheol-ryung!

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:32.272
Cheol-ryung!

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.649
Cheol-ryung!

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.651
Don't come any closer!

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:36.652
You could die...

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.904
Dammit...

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.031
Wait, wait!

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:43.033
There's one of me,
and 2, 3 of you...

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.285
Wait! Stay back!

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.711
You got a deathwish?!

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.132
How did he do this?

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.681
Dammit!

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:21.697
Come here!

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.157
Come at me!

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:29.788
<i>Can't risk a traitor.</i>

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.250
Please...

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.638
I took care of Park.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:47.890
And Lim?

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:54.271
Speak of the devil.

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:56.774
Comrade, answer.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:05.866
<i>Cheol-ryung?</i>

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:08.744
You really found Park.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:12.873
You're only breathing
because I let you.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:19.254
And I only did so
since we go a long way.

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:22.508
But you came here
to catch me?

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:24.885
That's regrettable.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.637
Shut up and wait.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.764
I'll end you
with my own hands.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:29.890
<i>What a shame.</i>

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.810
You're standing on
your grave.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.813
<i>It's not my fault,
rest in peace.</i>

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:21.733
Cheol-ryung!

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.840
Who was that bastard?

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:52.347
Secure 1st and 2nd floors!

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:54.975
How did he die?

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:59.605
Evidence and warrants
are all pointless now.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.483
Did you get shot?

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.904
Like hell I did,
I'd be dead.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.241
Shit, I got slashed.

01:05:18.874 --> 01:05:20.709
Out of the way,
move please.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.214
What's all this?

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:28.592
Where's Kang Jin-tae?

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:30.969
Det. Kang!

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:32.971
What is it? What?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.601
- Chief!
- Come here!

01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:39.478
Come here, you bastard!

01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:42.898
Be quiet,
don't you get it?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.983
This is a covert op.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:47.903
People cannot know about this.
Look at that crowd.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.200
Listen.

01:05:53.909 --> 01:05:58.455
I'll report this situation
to the chief myself.

01:05:58.497 --> 01:05:59.915
I'll handle this.

01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:02.459
This is Park's cell phone.

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:05.337
Extract all his 4-day
locations from this.

01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:06.838
Then give me a call.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.924
Don't make mistakes
like last time, got it?!

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.093
Okay, covert op...

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.594
Let's go.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:14.596
Det. Kang!

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.224
- Blood!
- It's okay, I'm fine.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.225
Shouldn't you go
to the ER?

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:21.478
I'm fine,
it's part of being a cop.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.991
How do I explain this
to my wife?

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.579
Are you okay?

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.582
Of course not,
it hurts like a bitch.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:46.086
How could you
do that to me?

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:50.007
They were coming at me,
and you took off without me.

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.842
We don't have
each other's backs?

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:55.012
I'm disappointed,
you unloyal bastard.

01:06:56.972 --> 01:07:00.308
Anyway, that big guy
who killed Park,

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.977
that's not Cha, right?

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:07.983
Goddammit...

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:13.196
If I ask you something,
answer me for once!

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.824
I'm risking my life
for this detail!

01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:19.453
Forget it! Whatever!

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:20.829
Screw this joint detail.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:22.330
He's Cha's man.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.833
You probably knew
Cha was a soldier.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.334
How many men
does he have?

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:29.004
I don't know.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:32.924
His squad consisted of
a dozen or so men,

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:36.928
and if his mercenaries
got involved...

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:43.435
Lim Cheol-ryung.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:51.026
What the hell is happening
here in the South?

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.323
Why'd a North Korean officer
come here with his men?

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.204
I tell you everything,
but not you.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.791
It's hard to maintain
this detail if you stay quiet.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.920
Who is Cha and
why is he here?

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:14.549
Why are you so desperate
to catch this bastard?!

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:18.053
Some time ago,
he killed a squad of censors.

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:21.098
And?

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.685
They were like my family.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.813
The men in the picture...

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.816
We were supposed to standby,

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:36.071
but because of me...

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.031
Because of you?

01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:44.662
As if terrorizing the streets
wasn't enough, now murder?

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:47.415
I told you to catch Park,
not kill him.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.167
We didn't do it.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.671
<i>'We? Who's we?'</i>

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:55.048
You and Lim
or you and I?

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.925
Are you guys dating now?

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.095
Fine, if not you,
then who?

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.098
Cha's not alone,
he has soldiers.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.182
<i>What?</i>

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:06.810
Park's smuggled weapons
must've ended up there.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:10.104
<i>Then he has at least
10 men with him.</i>

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.273
Did you get that from Lim?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.774
Yeah.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.777
<i>So what's Cha's end goal?</i>

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.779
<i>He doesn't know,
that's all I got.</i>

01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:21.283
<i>How could he not?
Leech more intel.</i>

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.912
<i>I'm not a fucking blood-sucker!</i>

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:28.665
<i>Anyway, recover Park's
cell phone...</i>

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.140
What's your area
of expertise?

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.393
Violent...

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.770
BDSM, I see.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:54.774
Cosplay for me.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:03.200
Wanna know how to free
yourself from the tracker?

01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:09.414
Help me! Please!

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.208
My arm's gonna break!

01:10:14.586 --> 01:10:16.213
He must be a cop too.

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:24.262
Dammit...

01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:27.515
You said you didn't
hide anything from me.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.768
I'm really sorry.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.187
You didn't want to
take my cell phone,

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.898
I can get worried
if I can't find you.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.276
What if you get in trouble
in a foreign land?

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:40.779
I was just worried.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.032
Listen.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.784
I can't seem to cut it.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.204
Okay, I'll try again.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:54.125
Anything can be cut.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.753
Here we go! Come on!

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.506
I got it!

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:01.883
I barely cut that thing oft.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.762
I have to return it, idiot!

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.890
Holy cow, that was tough.

01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:11.142
Where are you going?!

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:12.894
Come home with me!

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.522
Cheol-ryung! Cheol-ryung!

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:16.398
My stomach...

01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:19.901
Who kicked your butt?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.028
Go easy, that stings.

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:23.280
Stay put.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:27.284
Stop, that's enough.
It's just a bruise.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:29.244
At attention,
come back!

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:32.122
You dumb-ass!

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:35.125
Seriously...

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.252
Don't be a crybaby.

01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:39.504
You pinched too hard.

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:43.633
Give me your face.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:48.305
- Come here!
- It's okay, enough.

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.890
I've told you before.

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:56.271
If you get stabbed again,
we are finished.

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:59.232
So I don't go around
getting stabbed.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.735
Hey.

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.737
Why do you get beaten up?

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.489
You're not doing God's work.

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:09.284
Bad guys won't go extinct
because of what you do.

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:12.746
Are you burning with passion?
Your child is 9 years old!

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.248
Okay, that's enough.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.375
Mister.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:20.879
You're a cop like dad, right?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:24.299
You must fight really well.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:29.304
Do you shoot bad men
with guns like him?

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:30.597
Right.

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:31.973
Strip.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:35.977
What?

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.105
I mean, roll up your sleeve.

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:40.857
Look at this hand...

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:41.733
No need.

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:45.987
It looks bad...

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.990
How could you say that
with these hands?

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:53.870
Your salary is low
but I hate seeing you get hurt.

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:56.998
If you get married,
will you live in the South?

01:12:57.332 --> 01:13:00.335
I'm sure you don't have much,
but I'll overlook that.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:01.503
I...

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.339
have a girl.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.719
Why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:11.221
My god...

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.348
So embarrassing!

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.601
I'm sorry.

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.839
Do you love her?

01:13:58.518 --> 01:14:01.479
Of course, I love her.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:03.982
<i>Come on...</i>

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.108
Go to bed!

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:22.584
<i>They were like my family.</i>

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:26.838
<i>We were supposed to standby,
but because of me...</i>

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:31.342
He thinks he's so cool...

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:44.606
<i>Park Myung-ho</i>

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.502
Good work.

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:09.714
I'll reward you all
for your contribution.

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:14.469
After this mission,
we'll achieve freedom for good.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:17.180
Fight to your death.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:19.933
We got something.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.560
It came from Park's body.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:30.568
<i>After the 3-day ministerial talk,
the Northern delegation is returning...</i>

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.946
You scared me.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.490
Did you get any sleep?

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:40.203
Do you only have 1 suit?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.962
Come out here!

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.048
Park's phone was recovered,
let's get to it.

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.175
Looks good,
I loved that jacket.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.301
Have some breakfast.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.512
There's no time,
we have to go.

01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:59.055
Then throw it out!

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:00.557
Dammit...

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:03.184
Okay, let's eat a bit.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.686
- We'll eat fast.
- Did you dress up for him?

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:08.106
- Give it! Sit!
- So embarrassing.

01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:09.315
Come on.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.569
What's with off-season food?

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.823
This doesn't look normal.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:19.534
It's North Korean style.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:22.537
North Korean?
Because of him?

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.540
It looked like he had
no appetite.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.583
Give it a try.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:29.168
- Go on.
- It's good.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.796
- Come on, eat.
- I hope you like it.

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:40.555
I looked up the recipe online
and made it myself.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.682
- Is that true?
- Do you like it?

01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:44.309
It's great.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:45.935
- Is that so? I'm so glad!
- Have plenty.

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.812
- Have plenty.
- You liar.

01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:50.440
Auntie, mom made that.

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:51.316
Hey!

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.818
- My baby!
- Come here honey.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:56.779
You want some?

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.573
- I'll eat later.
- Don't sit on him!

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.909
You're being rude,
sit on your seat.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:04.912
- Daddy?
- Yes, baby?

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.789
Where's my iPhone?

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.583
- I'll buy it.
- When?

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.585
- When? Tomorrow?
- Okay, deal!

01:17:10.627 --> 01:17:13.421
- Don't get her hopes up!
- Why not?

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:15.423
It doesn't cost much,
I'll really buy it.

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.800
- No, she doesn't need it.
- Please eat.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:22.013
<i>Chief Pyo!
Your phone's bugged</i>

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:30.605
Is it okay?

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:33.274
Finish up,
I'll get the car started.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.901
Have some more.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.613
There's still plenty left.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:40.281
Finish your meal.

01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:43.534
It's okay, please.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:44.535
Have some more.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:56.798
Wait, wait!

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.049
Wait!

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.634
Det. Lim?

01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:02.929
Can I be informal
with you?

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:04.764
You already are.

01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:07.517
Is that so?

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:15.024
I don't know how much
butt-kicking you guys do,

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:17.902
and I know you won't
answer me.

01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:23.282
Please look after my husband.

01:18:23.658 --> 01:18:26.661
He's stubborn,
so my nagging doesn't work.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:31.666
Take on difficult work
in his stead.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:33.918
You're still single,
so you may not get it...

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.670
Sis, you're too much!

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:38.005
Your husband is important
but not someone else's?

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.632
Whose?

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:42.677
There must be someone,
I'm sure.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:46.764
Anyway, take care of him.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:52.145
He may be an idiot,
but he's all we've got.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:55.648
I understand.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:10.705
<i>It's called 'Supernote',
the plates can print fake cash,</i>

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:13.875
<i>and Cha's negotiating
with the Triads over it.</i>

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.377
- Meet up location?
<i>- DS Resort.</i>

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:18.504
Did you track Cha's location?

01:19:20.298 --> 01:19:21.758
Not yet.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:24.719
- Park's phone...
- Tell me, I know you do.

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.013
- I don't.
- Tell me at once!

01:19:28.723 --> 01:19:30.016
Gonna hit me?

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.523
- Tell me.
- I don't know!

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.275
Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you, asshole.

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:42.153
You planted a bug
on your partner.

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:44.363
No wonder my gramps
always said,

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.240
'all North Koreans
are commies'.

01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:49.368
You people couldn't be trusted,
even back then.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.747
3rd generation dictatorship
really messed things up.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.874
They're starving
people to death.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:59.754
The rich get richer,
the poor get poorer.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.381
Do you know what
the South's debt is?

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.008
I dunno, enlighten me.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.135
You can't be in huge debt
Without excellent credit.

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:08.638
Better than having
so many people starve.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.890
At least we are
all poor equally.

01:20:10.932 --> 01:20:12.892
What a load of shit.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:18.356
Is it fair that your leader
burns cash head over fist?

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.107
Don't insult the Republic!

01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:23.778
But I did, so what,
are you gonna hit me?

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:24.862
Okay, fine.

01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:27.615
I'll park here
to make it easy for you.

01:20:32.537 --> 01:20:36.499
Let's be honest.

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:38.876
You're here for
the Supernote plates, right?

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:42.880
But you told me you're here
to avenge your comrades.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:45.758
How could you lie
through your teeth?

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:52.974
I believed your lies,

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:56.477
and I almost
helped you out, asshole.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:58.813
I've never lied.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.357
Forget it.

01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:10.616
- Please help.
- How can I trust you?

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:13.744
If you help me get Cha,
I'll give you the plates.

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:16.247
I promise you.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:21.752
I know it's a lot,

01:21:23.838 --> 01:21:25.715
please help me.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.093
I'm begging you, comrade.

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.887
We should standby,
the support will arrive.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.854
What are you looking for?

01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:25.358
Us two can't face
an entire platoon.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.901
Not us, I'm going alone.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:27.902
What?

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.696
They're ex-Special Forces
who fought in wars.

01:22:31.906 --> 01:22:36.452
They're not like
your spineless units.

01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:42.208
If you want to live,
stay back here.

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:44.085
Not quite $100K.

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:46.087
What is it?

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.463
Buy Yeon-ah an iPhone.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.593
Yankee stuff aren't good
for children,

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.595
but at least live with
some class.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:57.974
What do you mean by that?

01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:01.102
Thanks for everything.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.703
So the plates are verified,
let's get to the deal.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.205
I've been thinking,

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:25.710
the tech is mine, and so are
printing and distribution.

01:23:26.252 --> 01:23:30.089
For that reason,
the plates are overpriced.

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:35.720
Let's meet halfway,
$5 million.

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:49.817
Got any Coke?
Give me a can.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:13.299
<i>The partners cannot be
more than 10m apart.</i>

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.301
Rule #3, did you forget?

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:17.428
The joint detail isn't done.

01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:22.933
Down there?

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:27.063
You got a plan?

01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:29.440
Place a call,
with the video.

01:24:29.482 --> 01:24:32.443
010-2335-6972,
that's my number.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.694
What will you do?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.034
Took you long enough.

01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:43.037
Answer it.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.554
That feels good.

01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:05.059
I missed this whenever
I returned home from overseas.

01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:12.066
My people must taste
the sweetness of capitalism.

01:25:15.069 --> 01:25:18.155
$10 million isn't
nearly enough.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.160
Make it $20 million.

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:27.081
What?

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:30.793
No? Then $30 million.

01:25:40.845 --> 01:25:43.430
Tick tock,
the clock's ticking.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:48.435
$40 million.

01:25:49.103 --> 01:25:51.105
This is a highway robbery!

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:55.109
Go around!

01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:01.782
I told you
not to fuck around.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.669
I didn't come here
to make a deal.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.672
I'll transfer $10 million
as we originally agreed...

01:26:16.714 --> 01:26:17.673
No need.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:20.426
I'll print my own money.

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:22.553
Grab the plates.

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.394
What will you do?
Hey! Hey!

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.260
You really came.

01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:07.765
Good to see you alive.

01:27:09.934 --> 01:27:14.188
Must we break things
whenever we meet?

01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:33.123
Time's up,
let's go.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:36.126
Take cover!

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.515
What the hell was that?

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:53.769
You okay?

01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:57.398
So that asshole's Cha?

01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.233
That's right.

01:28:12.288 --> 01:28:13.622
See you at the pier.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.364
It missed the heart,

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:49.241
you'll live with first aid.

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:54.496
- Dong-hoon!
- Det. Kang.

01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:57.750
It's okay,
you'll live.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.377
Officer down,
sector C, parking!

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.129
An ambulance, now!

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.758
Part of the being a cop.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:09.011
I won't die,
please go after him.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.097
Go and catch Cha.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.726
Put pressure on it.

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.311
Keep an eye on him.

01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:19.396
Yes, sir.
Dong-hoon!

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:22.316
Hurry, hurry!

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:30.115
<i>Route 2330, Songdo-bound,
getaway car found.</i>

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:31.742
<i>Any nearby units?</i>

01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:33.494
This is D-1,
we're on our way, over.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.249
<i>Kang, you bastard!</i>

01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:41.627
Return to the station at once.

01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:45.964
<i>I told you Lim can't go there
over and over again!</i>

01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:49.843
What exactly is the reason?

01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:52.221
Because our joint detail
will get exposed?

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:54.223
Or lose the Supernote
to them?

01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:56.600
It's out of our hands.

01:29:56.642 --> 01:29:58.727
The detail is finished!

01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:01.855
You said to suck
his blood for intel.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:04.608
<i>You couldn't stand the suits
running all over us.</i>

01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:07.986
Jin-tae, what's with you?

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:10.614
It's dangerous there.
The suits are...

01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:13.409
<i>I'm with the agents.</i>

01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:15.244
<i>Who gives a shit
about them!</i>

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:17.579
Det. Kang, suit here.

01:30:17.621 --> 01:30:20.958
<i>As of now,
we have the jurisdiction.</i>

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.835
Stop where you are
and turn him around.

01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:26.713
Why do I have to?!
You saw yourself too!

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:31.343
<i>He shot a cop
in broad daylight!</i>

01:30:31.385 --> 01:30:34.096
<i>Who cares about South
and North?!</i>

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:37.724
Okay, fine.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.601
Listen carefully, Det. Kang.

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:41.395
We're in a state of emergency.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:46.358
<i>We have to arrest Cha and
secure the plates at any cost.</i>

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:49.403
<i>You need to prevent Lim
from killing him.</i>

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.698
If need be,
you can eliminate Lim.

01:30:56.410 --> 01:30:57.953
Goddammit!

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:14.470
You promised,
the plates are mine.

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:17.347
I meant, my country's.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:23.562
Let me do my duty,
and become a respected cop.

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:26.064
Take them.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:28.442
One more thing.

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:32.696
When we get Cha,
will you kill him?

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.201
I understand your situation,

01:31:37.451 --> 01:31:41.580
but revenge is not in
our job description.

01:31:42.456 --> 01:31:43.707
He must be arrested
and punished.

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:46.460
Nothing more, got it?

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.503
I understand.

01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:49.505
Don't answer half-heartedly.

01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:52.508
I said I understand.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.470
That's what being a cop is.

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:07.439
There, that's him!

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:20.327
Slow down.

01:32:29.545 --> 01:32:31.505
- Hold the wheel.
- What?

01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:38.053
Get close.

01:34:22.616 --> 01:34:24.910
Hey, Cheol-ryung!

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:28.288
Stop, please.

01:34:34.628 --> 01:34:35.796
Why did you do it?

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.634
Cheol-ryung.

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:42.928
I...

01:34:44.805 --> 01:34:47.766
I didn't want to
be a lapdog

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:56.191
to the rotting heads of state
in the name of our people.

01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.652
Do not taint the honor
of our people.

01:35:00.946 --> 01:35:06.785
You betrayed their trust
to be here for your revenge.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:10.539
Goddamn shit!

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:15.669
Go on.

01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:22.676
Don't do it!

01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:31.685
What are you doing?!

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:34.896
You can't, you'll die!

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.690
Let go of me!

01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:41.778
You're gonna shoot me?

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.157
Answer me, will you?

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:50.704
You promised, asshole.

01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:52.622
You said you won't kill him!

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:53.749
Cha Gi-sung!

01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:01.757
Killed my wife.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:43.799
This was in her belongings.

01:36:45.425 --> 01:36:47.511
I thought
you needed to know.

01:37:10.283 --> 01:37:11.868
Fuck...

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:31.847
Before the cavalry arrives,

01:37:34.808 --> 01:37:35.976
take this.

01:37:36.518 --> 01:37:40.605
This fell into the river
with Cha.

01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:43.483
It's the only way
for you to live.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:46.111
- Doesn't matter if I die.
- You must.

01:37:46.152 --> 01:37:47.821
You have to live strong!

01:37:52.534 --> 01:37:56.371
Your wife in heaven
will want that too.

01:38:01.668 --> 01:38:04.588
Cha jumped to his death.

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:08.592
Even if he survived it,
I'll arrest him, so go.

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:09.843
Do you trust me?

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.100
Go on, go!

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:22.856
Go, right now!

01:38:57.891 --> 01:38:58.892
Good work.

01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:01.102
The Republic is proud of you.

01:39:01.394 --> 01:39:04.856
We have not recovered
Cha's body.

01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:06.107
If you give me some time...

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:09.736
'The threat has been
dealt with, return at once',

01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:12.572
that was the Chairman's
last order.

01:39:12.906 --> 01:39:13.949
Forget Cha.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.826
This marks the end of
the joint detail.

01:39:32.926 --> 01:39:34.928
Lend me your hand phone.

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:48.817
<i>Daddy, answer the phone!</i>

01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:50.819
<i>Don't pretend to be busy!</i>

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:54.322
Daddy's on the way home.

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:58.326
- Baby, whose daughter?
<i>- Daddy... daddy...</i>

01:39:58.368 --> 01:40:01.079
- It's been a...
<i>- Daddy...</i>

01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:03.957
Are you crying, baby?

01:40:06.376 --> 01:40:07.711
Look here.

01:40:08.628 --> 01:40:10.588
There's something I lost.

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:14.718
I don't have it anymore,
it's already with...

01:40:14.968 --> 01:40:16.970
I don't care about details.

01:40:19.014 --> 01:40:20.306
You got 2 hours.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:25.437
Bring the plates to the
power plant at Incheon pier.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.984
Then I promise
your family will live.

01:40:32.736 --> 01:40:37.991
<i>If I get tailed,
I will break that promise.</i>

01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:47.333
I'll tear your family
to pieces.

01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:52.422
Please just let my child go.

01:40:52.464 --> 01:40:55.175
- Yeon-ah!
- Mom!

01:41:06.019 --> 01:41:07.312
<i>Cheol-ryung!</i>

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.565
<i>My family is...</i>

01:41:11.858 --> 01:41:13.943
taken by Cha Gi-sung.

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:19.824
<i>He wants the plates by 9PM
at the power plant in Incheon pier.</i>

01:41:20.033 --> 01:41:25.789
Or he'll kill them both.

01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:28.666
<i>Cheol-ryung, please help.</i>

01:41:29.042 --> 01:41:31.294
<i>Please don't let them
kill Yeon-ah, please.</i>

01:41:43.098 --> 01:41:44.057
Leave us.

01:41:49.979 --> 01:41:50.939
Captain.

01:41:51.356 --> 01:41:52.816
Cha is still alive.

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:56.069
Let me take care of it.

01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:00.156
I told you the detail is finished!

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:02.158
Are you still hell-bent
on your revenge?

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:04.536
Separate your order
from personal vendetta!

01:42:04.953 --> 01:42:07.163
He took my South Korean
partner's family.

01:42:20.093 --> 01:42:21.094
Leave them be.

01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:27.183
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:40.780
I don't want to lose
you either.

01:42:43.074 --> 01:42:44.159
I'm sorry.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:48.037
I promise I'll return.

01:43:06.806 --> 01:43:09.184
- Mom...
- Yes, baby?

01:43:09.184 --> 01:43:11.644
Are the scary men gone?

01:43:12.312 --> 01:43:14.147
Yes, they're gone.

01:43:14.147 --> 01:43:15.773
But keep your eyes closed.

01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:18.651
Let's wait for daddy
a little more.

01:43:19.444 --> 01:43:20.778
Okay.

01:43:29.204 --> 01:43:30.788
The target has arrived.

01:43:33.458 --> 01:43:34.918
Yeon-ah?

01:43:35.835 --> 01:43:37.253
Yeon-ah!

01:43:39.422 --> 01:43:41.507
- Sweetie!
- Daddy!

01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:43.885
Honey, over here!

01:43:44.427 --> 01:43:46.387
- Daddy!
- We're here!

01:43:46.429 --> 01:43:47.513
Honey, we're up here!

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:49.891
- Yeon-ah!
- Over here!

01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:51.017
Honey!

01:43:51.059 --> 01:43:52.268
- Honey!
- Daddy!

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.022
- Honey!
- Daddy!

01:43:59.192 --> 01:44:00.151
Honey...

01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:01.194
Daddy!

01:44:01.819 --> 01:44:03.029
Honey...

01:44:10.078 --> 01:44:11.204
<i>Where are the plates?</i>

01:44:22.215 --> 01:44:24.008
Let the girls go first.

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:27.262
Then I'll hand them over.

01:44:30.223 --> 01:44:32.225
<i>Should I kill you all?</i>

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:34.269
<i>Hand them over.</i>

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.520
Honey...

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:40.525
You don't have them.

01:44:40.817 --> 01:44:43.278
No, I don't have them,
you bastard!

01:44:44.279 --> 01:44:45.989
<i>I don't have them!</i>

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:48.116
Stop hiding and come out!

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.742
Come out, you fuck!

01:44:49.784 --> 01:44:50.618
Yeon-ah, it's okay.

01:44:58.167 --> 01:45:04.257
No, no, I mean...
I apologize sir.

01:45:04.257 --> 01:45:05.133
I'm sorry, big brother.

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:10.513
<i>Cpt. Cha, this is all my fault.</i>

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:14.267
My family doesn't deserve this.

01:45:14.267 --> 01:45:17.729
Let them go
and just kill me!

01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:22.108
I'm sorry, let them go,
kill me instead!

01:45:24.527 --> 01:45:25.737
Are you listening?!

01:45:35.288 --> 01:45:38.291
Yeon-ah, daddy's here.

01:45:38.333 --> 01:45:42.754
We'll go home soon.

01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:48.134
Shoot

01:45:54.015 --> 01:45:56.309
<i>Comrade, you okay?</i>

01:46:01.147 --> 01:46:02.315
Cheol-ryung?

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.735
Sorry, I'm late.

01:46:06.527 --> 01:46:07.737
Thank you.

01:46:13.284 --> 01:46:14.369
Move and you're dead.

01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:17.330
Motherfucker...

01:46:17.663 --> 01:46:21.334
Let them go,
I'll give you the plates.

01:46:22.668 --> 01:46:23.961
Hey, Cheol-ryung.

01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:28.341
<i>Did you betray your country
to save these people?</i>

01:46:28.383 --> 01:46:29.967
<i>But...</i>

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:33.388
how can I trust you?

01:46:34.347 --> 01:46:35.348
Crane, upper deck.

01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:53.116
Captain.

01:46:53.533 --> 01:46:55.118
Front piece are missing.

01:47:01.249 --> 01:47:02.583
Cheol-ryung.

01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:05.378
We're 2 plates short.

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:09.090
Like I said,
they leave first.

01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:13.469
Not bad for a lapdog.

01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:16.848
<i>Alright, sure.</i>

01:47:20.393 --> 01:47:21.477
Let them go.

01:47:26.649 --> 01:47:28.734
<i>Take your family
and go home, comrade.</i>

01:47:29.152 --> 01:47:32.572
Yes, okay, Cheol-ryung.

01:47:33.489 --> 01:47:35.825
Okay, okay.

01:47:38.995 --> 01:47:40.329
What about...

01:47:41.497 --> 01:47:42.582
<i>you?</i>

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:44.083
Don't worry.

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:49.422
Brother.

01:47:52.425 --> 01:47:53.593
I'm sorry.

01:47:55.636 --> 01:47:57.722
I got you into this mess.

01:48:04.228 --> 01:48:06.314
I need you to get going.

01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:12.069
Okay, thank you,
thank you so much.

01:48:24.624 --> 01:48:25.833
Move!

01:48:39.472 --> 01:48:42.683
<i>Cheol-ryung, there's
no need to shed blood.</i>

01:48:44.477 --> 01:48:48.189
<i>If you return to the North,
you 'll gel' a firing squad.</i>

01:48:48.523 --> 01:48:49.690
<i>Join us.</i>

01:48:50.483 --> 01:48:52.485
<i>There's a boat standing by.</i>

01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:57.323
Captain!

01:49:06.499 --> 01:49:09.961
Alright, I'm coming.

01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:35.444
Why aren't we moving?

01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:36.821
Honey.

01:49:39.365 --> 01:49:43.327
You know I love you two
more than anything, right?

01:49:45.454 --> 01:49:46.539
But...

01:49:49.208 --> 01:49:51.919
I'm a detective,
a South Korean cop.

01:49:53.546 --> 01:49:54.547
So?

01:49:58.342 --> 01:49:59.427
Cheol-ryung is all alone...

01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:01.554
Don't beat around the bush.

01:50:01.971 --> 01:50:03.931
Go! Get going!

01:50:03.973 --> 01:50:05.808
Kill them all and bring
Cheol-ryung back.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:08.311
You really mean that?

01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:11.314
You won't go alone, right?
You'll contact the chief?

01:50:11.564 --> 01:50:13.316
Yes, of course.

01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:16.611
If you get hurt,
I'll kill you.

01:51:26.681 --> 01:51:28.891
Look, there.

01:53:15.748 --> 01:53:16.874
Cheol-ryung!

01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:19.376
Take this.

01:53:28.677 --> 01:53:30.137
Are you alright?

01:53:30.763 --> 01:53:31.806
Just fine.

01:53:32.306 --> 01:53:33.766
Sorry I'm late.

01:53:35.184 --> 01:53:37.102
Why aren't you at home?

01:53:37.645 --> 01:53:40.356
Then why are you here?
Same deal.

01:53:42.525 --> 01:53:44.777
You wailed and
begged for help.

01:53:45.277 --> 01:53:47.863
Yeah, I cried like a bitch,
wouldn't you?

01:53:48.781 --> 01:53:51.784
There's no one like me, though.

01:53:53.661 --> 01:53:54.995
Just be thankful.

01:53:57.665 --> 01:53:59.792
Cha's fleeing!
That way, there!

01:54:01.418 --> 01:54:03.879
I'm actually a marksman.

01:54:04.296 --> 01:54:07.007
Where did he go?
He's really fast.

01:55:25.377 --> 01:55:28.589
I should've cut your throat!

01:55:32.885 --> 01:55:33.969
Hey, asshole!

01:55:34.637 --> 01:55:38.474
Do you know
what these plates are?

01:55:40.935 --> 01:55:45.981
It's revenge against the Republic
for abandoning its people,

01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:48.901
and it's a reward

01:55:49.401 --> 01:55:50.945
for my blood and sweat!

01:55:50.986 --> 01:55:58.953
You cannot ruin
my noble plan!

01:56:10.923 --> 01:56:12.466
Cheol-ryung.

01:56:14.385 --> 01:56:15.719
Let's go...

01:56:19.765 --> 01:56:20.933
Stop!

01:56:23.018 --> 01:56:25.562
Cheol-ryung, look at me.

01:56:25.604 --> 01:56:27.439
Let me see.

01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:28.941
Cha...

01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:30.818
Goddammit!

01:57:21.618 --> 01:57:23.704
You sons of bitches.

01:58:31.063 --> 01:58:32.564
Take it with you.

01:58:36.235 --> 01:58:40.072
That would be fast track
to prison camp.

01:58:41.073 --> 01:58:43.408
My country should be
ashamed by this.

01:58:47.579 --> 01:58:49.665
Be a cop respected
by your country.

01:58:55.587 --> 01:59:00.092
It's not like we get paid
enough for our services.

01:59:00.134 --> 01:59:03.053
We starve, get injured,
and almost die too.

01:59:05.222 --> 01:59:10.269
And it's not like
they'll award us.

01:59:11.061 --> 01:59:15.107
Why did you become a cop?

01:59:15.315 --> 01:59:17.109
I didn't know it'd be like this.

01:59:17.568 --> 01:59:21.655
I thought I'd look cool.
Firing guns,

01:59:21.697 --> 01:59:25.159
catching bad guys,
reading their rights,

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.413
cuffing them, and being cheered on
by a crowd like in the movies.

01:59:31.123 --> 01:59:33.417
What about you?

01:59:33.959 --> 01:59:38.297
Everyone's busy starving,
so no criminals, I bet.

01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:44.011
Wait, it's a heaven,
for detectives.

01:59:45.804 --> 01:59:49.016
Take me with you,
I want to defect to the North.

01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:53.187
You better be careful.

01:59:53.687 --> 01:59:56.023
Your mouth will
get you arrested.

01:59:59.318 --> 02:00:02.779
Anyway, that was how I began.

02:00:03.155 --> 02:00:09.286
Catch bad guys,
save good guys. You?

02:00:10.162 --> 02:00:13.040
Me too, in the beginning.

02:00:15.167 --> 02:00:19.129
Oh man, oh man.
I'm in so much pain.

02:00:20.797 --> 02:00:23.759
Took them long enough.

02:00:24.676 --> 02:00:28.138
That bastard of a chief.

02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:55.415
<i>1 year later,
Pyongyang</i>

02:01:30.242 --> 02:01:31.368
<i>Pyongyang?</i>

02:01:31.785 --> 02:01:32.869
Yeah.

02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:34.246
On what case?

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:37.291
Pyongyang's first ever
serial killer.

02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:41.378
The suspect is a South Korean,
he defected to the North.

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.506
Anyway, this is a covert op.

02:01:44.923 --> 02:01:46.300
Your counterpart
has been chosen.

02:01:47.426 --> 02:01:48.885
Oh yeah?

02:01:48.927 --> 02:01:50.137
<i>Brother.</i>

02:01:52.306 --> 02:01:55.267
You're still ugly as ever.

02:01:56.685 --> 02:01:58.603
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

02:02:02.399 --> 02:02:04.276
Rule #1 of our joint detail.

02:02:05.277 --> 02:02:09.281
South's weapon is confiscated
until the case wraps.

02:02:09.656 --> 02:02:11.742
Fine, okay.

02:02:11.783 --> 02:02:13.994
Let's get going.

02:02:14.786 --> 02:02:21.293
My sister-in-law went nuts
when I told her I'd be here...
