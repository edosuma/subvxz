12:06.142 --> 12:07.598
A more current technique would be
harder to detect and trace...

12:07.727 --> 12:08.716
but it might also arouse suspicion
about Colonel Malles role in this affair.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.717

but it might also arouse suspicion
about Colonel Malles role in this affair.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.722
Are you saying he's using an old method
just so no-one suspects Malles?

12:14.734 --> 12:15.723
Are you saying he's using an old method
just so no-one suspects Malles?

12:18.988 --> 12:19.977
Or maybe Malles is just a pawn,
used to make us think that......

12:19.989 --> 12:20.978
Or maybe Malles is just a pawn,
used to make us think that......

12:20.990 --> 12:21.979

12:23.284 --> 12:24.273
Maybe there is another sponsor.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.274
Maybe there is another sponsor.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.571
Maybe there is another sponsor.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.693
Now you're stretching it.
It's not like you have any hard evidence.

12:27.705 --> 12:28.694

Now you're stretching it.
It's not like you have any hard evidence.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.494
Evidence?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.284
Just a whisper.
I hear it in my ghost.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.287
Just a whisper.
I hear it in my ghost.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.080
Which reminds me.
Are you still using that revolver?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.707
Which reminds me.
Are you still using that revolver?

12:40.802 --> 12:41.791
You should stop worrying about
the automatics jamming up.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.589
You should stop worrying about
the automatics jamming up.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.466
I like my Matever.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.587
Stopping power is more important
than your taste in guns.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.588
Stopping power is more important

12:47.600 --> 12:48.589

12:54.607 --> 12:55.312
Major.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.766
I want to ask you something.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.891
Why did you transfer a guy like me
from the police force?

12:58.903 --> 12:59.892
Why did you transfer a guy like me

12:59.904 --> 13:01.269

Because we need a guy like you.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.980
Because we need a guy like you.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.898

Over specialize and you breed in weakness.
It's a slow death.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.302
Over specialize and you breed in weakness.
It's a slow death.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.675
That's all.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.066

It's gonna be one of those days.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.825
It's gonna be one of those days.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.579

40:14.746 --> 40:16.327
Tomorrow I'll dive into that thing.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.745
Is that safe?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.535
Why not contain it
in another body first?

40:20.460 --> 40:21.449

Didn't that robot remind you of me?

41:48.089 --> 41:49.078
Of course not.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.834
I don't mean physically.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.332
What then?

41:52.468 --> 41:53.457
Complete cyborgs like myself

47:10.286 --> 47:12.151
Ultimate/y, this enabled us

47:12.246 --> 47:13.235
in which we lured her program
into a designated body.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.236
in which we lured her program
into a designated body.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.704
in which we lured her program

47:16.167 --> 47:17.156

47:19.170 --> 47:20.159
and then murdered her real body?

47:20.171 --> 47:21.456
and then murdered her real body?

47:21.881 --> 47:23.417
Yes, that sums it up.

47:23.841 --> 47:24.830
She just happened to
come to your country.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.332
She just happened to
come to your country.

47:26.469 --> 47:27.458
She's originally from America

47:28.471 --> 47:30.177
She's originally from America
and they helped us capture her.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.255
That's why we'd like to
take her back ourselves.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.760
I hope you have no objections.

47:33.851 --> 47:34.840

47:50.868 --> 47:52.859
All external controls are turned off.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.109
A year before?

56:13.203 --> 56:14.192
But wasn't it a project
set up to capture the Puppet Master?

56:14.204 --> 56:15.193
But wasn't it a project
set up to capture the Puppet Master?

56:15.205 --> 56:17.036
But wasn't it a project

56:17.207 --> 56:18.743
Well, try this one.

56:18.876 --> 56:19.865
They definitely were chasing
the Puppet Master...

56:19.877 --> 56:21.367
They definitely were chasing

56:33.515 --> 56:34.504
Maybe we ’ve been taken for a ride.

56:34.516 --> 56:35.926
Maybe we ’ve been taken for a ride.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.141
What if this Puppet Master is...

56:38.228 --> 56:39.217
really some sort of a tool the MOA uses
to get their way with things...

56:39.229 --> 56:40.218

56:42.900 --> 56:43.889
and somehow, they lost control of it?

56:43.901 --> 56:45.186
and somehow, they lost control of it?

56:45.277 --> 56:46.266
So they are in a hurry to get it back.

56:46.278 --> 56:48.109
So they are in a hurry to get it back.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.269
