WEBVTT

00:01.462 --> 00:04.330
This is a historic day
for Greendale.

00:04.331 --> 00:09.235
This state-of-the-art Subway
sandwichery in our cafetorium

00:09.236 --> 00:12.021
represents Greendale's
first steps forward

00:12.022 --> 00:14.257
into the realm
of the legitimate!

00:14.258 --> 00:15.341
Students: Ooh.

00:15.342 --> 00:17.410
Oh, oh. No problem.
You know what?

00:17.411 --> 00:19.512
I'm just going to get it started
with my teeth.

00:19.513 --> 00:22.031
The legitimate! Oh.
The legitimate!

00:22.032 --> 00:23.850
That should be
my sandwich shop.

00:23.851 --> 00:25.735
It was my idea
to put one there.

00:25.736 --> 00:27.203
- We're here for you, Shirley.
- Yeah.

00:27.204 --> 00:29.021
Troy, Annie, and I know what
it's like to be displaced.

00:29.022 --> 00:31.040
They're tenting our building
for termites, so we're homeless.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.792
I'm staying
in the sleep study lab.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.577
All I have to do is wake up
every three hours and go...

00:34.578 --> 00:37.547
[Screams]
And I get two credits.

00:37.548 --> 00:39.301
Yeah, and we're going to build
a super awesome pillow fort

00:39.302 --> 00:41.050
- here at the school.
- Another pillow fort?

00:41.051 --> 00:42.585
Kind of repeating yourselves,
aren't you?

00:42.586 --> 00:45.138
That was a blanket fort.
This will be a pillow fort.

00:45.139 --> 00:47.140
Way more difficult, way better.

00:47.141 --> 00:49.392
All difficult things are better,
like carrying a disease

00:49.393 --> 00:51.227
- or holding in a fart right now.
- Aha!

00:51.228 --> 00:54.397
I just found out how Shirley and I
are going to take down Subway.

00:54.398 --> 00:56.065
- Oh, how?
- Dean?

00:56.066 --> 00:58.868
I assume you're familiar
with the Greendale bylaws.

00:58.869 --> 01:01.821
- I am not.
- Shirley, you do the honors.

01:01.822 --> 01:03.740
My brain starts getting weird
this time of night.

01:03.741 --> 01:05.575
It's 10:00 a.m.

01:05.576 --> 01:07.744
- You're welcome.
- Uh-oh.

01:07.745 --> 01:09.996
"Any business operating
for profit on Greendale's campus

01:09.997 --> 01:13.583
must be at least 51% owned by
a registered Greendale student"!

01:13.584 --> 01:15.251
That's too bad, Dean.

01:15.252 --> 01:17.086
I don't recall seeing Subway

01:17.087 --> 01:18.922
in my premenopausal,
postfeminist

01:18.923 --> 01:20.707
experiential marketing class.

01:20.708 --> 01:22.926
Actually, I'm on the wait list

01:22.927 --> 01:25.428
- for the premen/postfem/ex mark.
- Who are you?

01:25.429 --> 01:28.765
Gang, meet Greendale's
newest student, Subway.

01:28.766 --> 01:30.550
Your name is Subway?

01:30.551 --> 01:34.020
Yep, using a groundbreaking
but surprisingly legal process

01:34.021 --> 01:37.140
known as "corpohumanization",
real people such as myself

01:37.141 --> 01:39.776
are now allowed to represent
the collective humanity

01:39.777 --> 01:41.027
of business owners.

01:41.028 --> 01:43.062
I have contractually waived
my birth identity

01:43.063 --> 01:47.934
and am now a man and student
named... Subway.

01:47.935 --> 01:50.036
I don't believe this.

01:50.037 --> 01:52.622
Come on, Subway,
there is no way you're 5'10".

01:52.623 --> 01:55.107
So you can vote?

01:55.108 --> 01:57.493
Actually, no, because
technically I'm only a week old.

01:57.494 --> 01:58.795
Aww.

01:58.796 --> 01:59.796
But please don't think of me

01:59.797 --> 02:01.080
as any less human
than yourselves.

02:01.081 --> 02:03.166
I'm here to hang out,
take weird classes,

02:03.167 --> 02:06.219
and party as hearty
as my morality clause allows.

02:06.220 --> 02:09.255
Eat fresh? Eat fresh?

02:09.256 --> 02:11.307
- Eat fresh.
- That's my man.

02:11.308 --> 02:12.842
Wow, did you know
Greendale students

02:12.843 --> 02:15.590
are technically
in the army reserves?

02:17.297 --> 02:19.599
Let's say a little prayer
for peace.

02:20.468 --> 02:23.653
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

02:23.654 --> 02:26.823
♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

02:26.824 --> 02:30.326
♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪

02:30.327 --> 02:34.247
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:34.248 --> 02:39.202
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

02:39.203 --> 02:43.539
♪ one by one they all
just fade away ♪

02:46.903 --> 02:49.145
Annie, you've got to get me
into this sleep lab.

02:49.146 --> 02:51.381
I can't think of a better use
of my time here

02:51.382 --> 02:52.515
than being unconscious.

02:52.516 --> 02:54.100
It's not a blowoff class, Jeff.

02:54.101 --> 02:56.135
We're only allowed to bring
one stuffed animal.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.004
I'm bringing Ruthie...

02:58.005 --> 03:00.640
[Whispers] But using her pouch
to sneaking Nathan.

03:00.641 --> 03:02.648
Well, have fun.

03:04.845 --> 03:06.863
Wait, since when
do we have lockers?

03:06.864 --> 03:09.699
Uh, since
registration day, 2009.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.350
Jeff, did you skip

03:11.351 --> 03:13.286
the Preorientation Freshman
Welcome Seminar

03:13.287 --> 03:15.354
and Diversity Fire Circle?

03:15.355 --> 03:17.240
This explains so much
about you.

03:17.241 --> 03:20.159
Are you saying I've had
a locker here for 2 1/2 years?

03:23.831 --> 03:26.365
Whoa, whoa.
Wow.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.751
"Halloween dance."
"Post-Halloween dance."

03:28.752 --> 03:30.003
"Dance contest."

03:30.004 --> 03:31.554
"Contest dance."
Oh, come on.

03:31.555 --> 03:34.841
What's this? "Save Garrett"?
What's wrong with Garrett?

03:34.842 --> 03:38.728
Nothing now.
We saved him.

03:38.729 --> 03:39.729
Aah!

03:39.730 --> 03:41.848
Wait, that's "saved" Garrett?

03:41.849 --> 03:44.717
Ooh, what's this?
Love letter?

03:44.718 --> 03:46.903
Oh, it's probably one of many.

03:46.904 --> 03:48.988
Oh, no.
This is a hate letter.

03:48.989 --> 03:50.389
What?
Let me see that.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.025
"Dear Jeff,
this might come as a shock

03:52.026 --> 03:53.993
"to someone who thinks
he's God's gift to the world,

03:53.994 --> 03:55.995
"but you're actually
an inconsiderate jerk.

03:55.996 --> 03:57.063
Kim."

03:57.064 --> 03:58.948
- "Inconsiderate"?
- Who's Kim?

03:58.949 --> 04:01.117
I don't know, and clearly
she doesn't know me.

04:01.118 --> 04:02.702
- [Sneezes]
- Gesundheit.

04:02.703 --> 04:03.703
I didn't sneeze.

04:03.704 --> 04:06.205
[Scoffs]

04:07.508 --> 04:08.858
Look at these idiots.

04:08.859 --> 04:10.576
Cattle, sheep...

04:10.577 --> 04:13.046
Other animals
that travel in herds.

04:13.047 --> 04:14.246
I want to say snakes.

04:14.247 --> 04:16.298
Am I the only person
enraged by the fact

04:16.300 --> 04:18.601
that corporations
are taking human form?

04:18.601 --> 04:21.637
I totally predicted this in
my High School newspaper column

04:21.637 --> 04:23.089
"Britta unfiltered."

04:23.090 --> 04:26.092
- Unfiltered. I get it.
- Get what?

04:26.093 --> 04:29.595
Actually, maybe Subway taking
human form could be its undoing.

04:29.596 --> 04:31.097
Uh, Britta...

04:31.098 --> 04:33.232
You're a, uh, progressive woman

04:33.233 --> 04:37.537
of a more...
liberated looseness.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.906
You could get close to Subway
and find out some dirt on him.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.375
Corporate espionage.
I like it.

04:42.376 --> 04:45.828
Microphones hidden in lipstick.
Lipstick hidden in microphones.

04:45.829 --> 04:47.547
And the deadliest weapon
of them all...

04:47.548 --> 04:51.117
- The penis flytrap.
- Okay! This conversation is over.

04:51.118 --> 04:53.719
I am not a whore,
and not that I've done the math,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.005
but if I were,
I'd be the super classy kind

04:56.006 --> 04:59.092
that gets flown to Dubai to stay
in an underwater hotel.

05:03.347 --> 05:05.932
- Abed, Troy.
- Ah, don't worry, Dean.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.600
We have all the proper permits
right here.

05:07.601 --> 05:08.901
Oh, silly me!

05:08.902 --> 05:11.821
This is a coupon for 20% off
at bed bath & beyond.

05:11.822 --> 05:15.942
No need to bribe me, Troy.
Actually...

05:15.943 --> 05:17.493
There's plenty more
where that came from.

05:17.494 --> 05:19.946
Look, I was just googling
record lengths of stuff,

05:19.947 --> 05:22.365
and apparently there's
a guinness world record

05:22.366 --> 05:24.750
for the biggest pillow...
or blanket fort.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.919
So you boys...
you should go for it.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.489
Put this school on the map.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.841
We'd have a better chance
of setting the record

05:31.842 --> 05:34.594
if we made this a blanket fort,
you know, take less time.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.012
We wanted to make
a pillow fort.

05:36.013 --> 05:38.097
I don't want to sacrifice
quality for square footage.

05:38.098 --> 05:40.216
We don't need a world record to
tell us we did something cool.

05:40.217 --> 05:41.500
But if we won,
we might meet that dude

05:41.501 --> 05:42.518
with the curly fingernails.

05:42.519 --> 05:44.020
Shridhar Chillal?
Not interested.

05:44.021 --> 05:48.691
I saw him on a talk show.
He came off as pretentious.

05:48.692 --> 05:51.010
- I'm going to go get a drink.
- Okay.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.231
- Troy Barnes.
- Vice Dean Laybourne.

05:55.232 --> 05:58.784
You have a beard...
And a ponytail.

05:58.785 --> 06:00.319
Going through some stuff
right now, Troy.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.138
Don't worry about it.
[Clears throat]

06:02.139 --> 06:03.906
Any chance you've given
a second thought to joining

06:03.907 --> 06:05.124
my air conditioning
repair school?

06:05.125 --> 06:06.526
Sorry.

06:06.527 --> 06:09.528
Kind of busy at the moment doing
some awesome work with Abed.

06:09.529 --> 06:11.948
Ah, yeah, Abed.

06:11.949 --> 06:14.634
You guys watch that television
show together, don't you?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.169
Inspector Spacetime.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.369
Funny, Troy.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.205
You and Abed have
always reminded me

06:19.206 --> 06:21.540
of the inspector
and his trusty constable Reggie.

06:21.541 --> 06:22.808
[Chuckles]
Cool!

06:22.809 --> 06:25.011
The inspector, of course,
is smart, decisive,

06:25.012 --> 06:26.729
and Reggie is...

06:26.730 --> 06:29.215
Well, he's Reggie.

06:29.216 --> 06:31.767
Reggie is trained
in zero-gravity martial arts

06:31.768 --> 06:32.818
and has a whistle.

06:32.819 --> 06:34.070
[Whispers]
Yeah.

06:34.071 --> 06:36.606
But he never really
gets to blow the whistle

06:36.607 --> 06:39.075
unless the inspector
says it's okay.

06:39.076 --> 06:42.561
Less of a friendship,
more of a self-centered nerd

06:42.562 --> 06:44.247
and his naive, obedient lapdog.

06:44.248 --> 06:45.815
Well, I got a thing.

06:45.816 --> 06:49.118
You take care.

06:49.119 --> 06:51.570
Well, according to the office,
this is the locker

06:51.571 --> 06:55.258
of the only Kim I've had
any class with since 2009.

06:55.259 --> 06:57.510
Wonder what you did
to make her so mad.

06:57.511 --> 07:00.630
Maybe the two of you made out,
and then you forgot about her.

07:00.631 --> 07:03.516
Annie, that's what
you think of me?

07:03.517 --> 07:05.017
I don't make out
with forgettable women.

07:05.018 --> 07:06.052
Can I help you?

07:06.053 --> 07:08.020
We're looking
for Kim McFadden.

07:08.021 --> 07:10.389
- This is her locker, right?
- Are you serious?

07:10.390 --> 07:13.142
She slipped a note into
my locker a couple years ago.

07:13.143 --> 07:14.426
I guess I pissed her off
somehow.

07:14.427 --> 07:17.947
- I'm hoping to apologize.
- That might not be easy.

07:17.948 --> 07:20.266
Kim's no longer with us.

07:20.267 --> 07:23.202
- She died two weeks ago.
- What?

07:23.203 --> 07:25.121
Sorry to drop that
on you and run,

07:25.122 --> 07:26.789
but there's a rally
for Garrett.

07:26.790 --> 07:29.408
But we saved him.

07:29.409 --> 07:33.212
Did we?

07:35.966 --> 07:37.049
What do you recommend?

07:37.050 --> 07:39.051
What's it to you, meat pusher?

07:39.052 --> 07:40.920
Sounds like you might be
a vegetarian.

07:40.921 --> 07:42.505
You should try
Subway's Veggie Delite.

07:42.506 --> 07:44.957
You should try reading
Orwell's 1984.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.726
I have.
It's a great book.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.160
It really awakened me
in High School.

07:48.161 --> 07:49.461
I think kids should be forced
to read it.

07:49.462 --> 07:52.448
Me too.
Anyway, you're living it.

07:52.449 --> 07:55.084
You're a human puppet with big
sandwich's hand up your ass.

07:55.085 --> 07:56.519
Is this what you dreamt
of being?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.822
Unfortunately I'm not allowed
to discuss my former life

07:59.823 --> 08:01.274
or engage in any
nonplatonic relations,

08:01.275 --> 08:02.908
practice religion in public,

08:02.909 --> 08:05.311
or eat any nonfresh,
unhealthy food like that

08:05.312 --> 08:06.946
found anywhere outside Subway.

08:06.947 --> 08:08.381
Why are you getting all that?

08:08.382 --> 08:10.316
I wanted to stand next to you
for a moment.

08:10.317 --> 08:12.818
It was worth it.

08:12.819 --> 08:18.257
Like a good book by Orwell
or a Veggie Delite.

08:21.011 --> 08:23.379
Is that you, Subway?

08:23.380 --> 08:25.181
My eyesight ain't
what it used to be.

08:25.182 --> 08:26.832
Eat these tater tots, Harry.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.602
For what it's worth, I think you
might see more than all of us.

08:29.603 --> 08:32.671
[Shirley giggling]

08:32.672 --> 08:33.972
Did you see him smiling at you?

08:33.974 --> 08:36.025
Top-notch whoresmanship,
Britta.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.461
- Pierce.
- Sorry. Whoreswomanship.

08:38.462 --> 08:40.145
[Chuckles]
Forgot it was the '90s.

08:40.147 --> 08:41.563
Uh-oh.

08:41.565 --> 08:43.566
Anyway...
Thank you, Britta.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.951
I knew we could count on you
to help us take him down!

08:45.952 --> 08:48.070
Yep, that's me, the girl
who's going to destroy

08:48.071 --> 08:50.706
the big sandwich company
with the dreamy eyes.

08:50.707 --> 08:53.642
[Giggles] Ooh!
We did it, Pierce.

09:05.953 --> 09:08.583
[Sighs]

09:10.475 --> 09:11.975
Powerful passage, isn't it?

09:11.976 --> 09:15.095
"She had become
a physical necessity."

09:15.096 --> 09:17.397
You circled this paragraph.

09:17.398 --> 09:19.700
I can't say that I did.

09:19.701 --> 09:22.119
I just think it's a striking
expression of love's ability

09:22.120 --> 09:25.639
to persevere within the cracks
and cogs of inhuman systems.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.109
Who were you, Subway,
before you were Subway?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.744
I can't say.

09:30.745 --> 09:32.145
I have to live
within the rules.

09:32.146 --> 09:34.164
This identity is my life.

09:34.165 --> 09:35.949
If I do this
for three more years,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.117
I can live a real dream.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.585
Well, at least tell me
what that is.

09:38.586 --> 09:41.655
I want to run a nonprofit
shelter for handicapped animals.

09:41.656 --> 09:43.657
Dogs with wheels for hind legs.

09:43.658 --> 09:45.292
- Deaf hamsters.
- [Whispers] One-eyed cats?

09:45.293 --> 09:49.179
Well, they weren't on the top
of my list, but sure.

09:49.180 --> 09:50.280
I should go.

09:50.281 --> 09:51.882
This is getting
out of bounds for me.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.767
[Whispers]
Eat fresh.

09:53.768 --> 09:56.436
[Vocalizing]

09:56.437 --> 09:58.387
You should put the small ones
in the middle,

09:58.388 --> 09:59.665
or the wall won't hold
the ceiling.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.285
Why do I always have
to be your Reggie?

10:01.286 --> 10:02.309
What?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.510
I wanted to make
a blanket fort,

10:03.511 --> 10:05.646
and you never even gave it
a second thought.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.614
I'm not even your sidekick.
I'm your underkick.

10:07.615 --> 10:09.616
I never said
you couldn't do anything.

10:09.617 --> 10:12.569
If you want to make a blanket
fort, that's fine with me.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.820
Thank you.

10:13.821 --> 10:17.658
Just don't make it
part of my pillow fort.

10:20.194 --> 10:22.079
Fine.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.530
I'll start it somewhere else.

10:23.531 --> 10:27.884
Have fun stacking pillows
like a baby.

10:27.885 --> 10:30.837
Jeff, are you okay?

10:30.838 --> 10:33.223
I'm lying on campus furniture,
so no.

10:33.224 --> 10:37.644
Is it about this Kim girl?

10:37.645 --> 10:40.947
She is someone who died
thinking I was a dick.

10:40.948 --> 10:42.716
I can never apologize.

10:42.717 --> 10:44.484
I can never change her mind.

10:44.485 --> 10:47.020
That makes me a dick forever.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.272
You think that's
what an apology is?

10:49.273 --> 10:52.826
A spell you cast on another
person to make them forgive you?

10:52.827 --> 10:56.196
Apologies are opportunities
to admit your own mistakes.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.748
Apologize to her locker.

10:57.749 --> 11:00.667
But how can I apologize if
I don't know what I did wrong?

11:00.668 --> 11:04.621
Well, didn't she call you
inconsiderate?

11:04.622 --> 11:08.959
Sounds to me like you know
exactly what you did wrong.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.095
- Leonard, what are you doing?
- Abed's fort needs pillows.

11:12.096 --> 11:13.680
But I was going to lie there.

11:13.681 --> 11:17.083
I was going to invest
in IBM in 1952,

11:17.084 --> 11:19.553
but life is full
of disappointments.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.108
Eating fresh, are we?

11:25.109 --> 11:27.594
Have you found any dirt
on Subway yet?

11:27.595 --> 11:29.863
No, nothing. I should
probably hang out with him more.

11:29.864 --> 11:32.699
You know what I think?
I think you're falling for him.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.035
I am not.
Who do you think I am?

11:35.036 --> 11:36.236
I lived in New York.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.271
You never lived anywhere.

11:38.272 --> 11:40.057
You're a weapon
designed for sex.

11:40.058 --> 11:41.408
You only think
you lived in New York

11:41.409 --> 11:42.909
'cause I implanted
your memories.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.779
Oh, Pierce, stop it!
Look what we're becoming.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.798
I'm sorry we pulled you
into this dirty game.

11:47.799 --> 11:48.799
I want you to stop.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.283
Yeah, we're pulling you out...

11:50.284 --> 11:52.836
Right after
your last assignment.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.756
This pen is a microphone.

11:55.757 --> 12:00.510
It's also a miniflask.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.145
Did you just drink ink?

12:02.146 --> 12:03.947
Just plant this on Subway,

12:03.948 --> 12:05.599
and you'll never have
to see him again.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.734
Until then,
keep him interested.

12:07.735 --> 12:11.321
And for God's sakes, slap
some life on those dead lips.

12:11.322 --> 12:13.240
[Scoffs]

12:13.241 --> 12:14.974
[Militaristic music]

12:14.975 --> 12:18.028
Hello, Abed.
How's the pillow fort going?

12:18.029 --> 12:20.330
It's hard making something
perfect, but it's worth it.

12:20.331 --> 12:22.416
Yeah, I'll remember that
when I'm being given a key

12:22.417 --> 12:24.167
to the secret guinness
record holders' clubhouse,

12:24.168 --> 12:26.386
where I'll be hanging with those
two fat guys on motorcycles

12:26.387 --> 12:28.588
and being fitted
for a beard of bees.

12:28.589 --> 12:31.591
Whoo! Well, Troy, I just got
off the phone with Guinness,

12:31.592 --> 12:33.126
and they are sending
a representative

12:33.127 --> 12:35.929
to have a look-see
at your blanket fort.

12:35.930 --> 12:38.965
- Are we world-record ready?
- Garrett?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.968
We are still more than 2,000
square feet shy of the record.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.838
Abed's pillow fort is the only
thing standing in our way.

12:44.839 --> 12:46.673
Well, what are we going
to do here, guys?

12:46.674 --> 12:48.341
Is there a way
we can connect them?

12:48.342 --> 12:50.143
You can't connect the blanket
fort to the pillow fort

12:50.144 --> 12:51.311
and still call it
a pillow fort.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.395
Even if you could,
I'd rather see

12:52.396 --> 12:53.780
my work destroyed
than compromise it.

12:53.781 --> 12:56.516
Great, Abed will destroy
his pillow fort,

12:56.517 --> 12:59.619
and Troy will expand
his blanket fort into the space.

12:59.620 --> 13:00.987
Everyone wins.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.207
Except Abed, but you know,
not everyone can win.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.992
Is that what you want, Troy?

13:05.993 --> 13:09.813
For me to destroy my pillow fort
so you could set your record?

13:09.814 --> 13:12.566
- It is.
- Magnitude.

13:12.567 --> 13:15.492
Evacuate fort Abed,
and prepare for self-destruct.

13:15.493 --> 13:18.371
- Sir?
- Do it. We're done here.

13:18.372 --> 13:22.208
Pop, pop, Captain.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.102
Oh!
[Gasps] Subway.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.404
Britta, I was worried
you wouldn't come.

13:34.405 --> 13:38.408
- I can't stop thinking about you.
- Shh.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.329
They wanted me to plant
a bug on you.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.880
I can't, and I won't.

13:43.881 --> 13:47.200
Our values, our identities...
they mean nothing to me now.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.702
Only the primal remains.

13:48.703 --> 13:52.672
To me, you are simply
a physical necessity.

13:52.673 --> 13:53.924
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

13:53.925 --> 13:56.543
Oh, Subway.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.346
[Moaning]

13:59.347 --> 14:01.214
Subway.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.683
- Oh, Subway.
- Mmm.

14:03.684 --> 14:06.019
Oh, Subway.
[Gasps]

14:06.020 --> 14:07.020
Oh, no, no.

14:07.021 --> 14:08.588
No, this is wrong, Pierce.

14:08.589 --> 14:09.589
I just wanted to open
a sandwich shop.

14:09.590 --> 14:10.774
I did not sign up for this.

14:10.775 --> 14:12.559
You don't want to get
your hands dirty, fine.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.277
I will.

14:14.278 --> 14:18.773
Nice knowing you, Subway.
If that is your real name.

14:21.285 --> 14:24.287
Ahh.

14:33.303 --> 14:37.339
Kim.
It's me, Jeff.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.558
The inconsiderate jerk.

14:39.559 --> 14:41.426
Look, I don't remember
hurting you,

14:41.427 --> 14:43.912
and I have to assume
that's what hurt you.

14:43.913 --> 14:45.547
God knows what crime
you've committed

14:45.548 --> 14:47.899
to deserve me
disregarding you entirely.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.686
But whatever your crime,
I think we both know

14:50.687 --> 14:52.938
the real crime is mine.

14:52.939 --> 14:54.856
I'm a self-centered,
shallow jackass.

14:54.857 --> 15:00.495
And I just want to...
thank you for your note

15:00.496 --> 15:03.582
because I'm going
to try and change.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.233
I just wish you were here
to forgive me.

15:05.234 --> 15:07.068
I am.

15:07.069 --> 15:09.571
And I do.

15:09.572 --> 15:10.589
I'm Kim.

15:10.590 --> 15:11.623
What?

15:11.624 --> 15:13.508
You said Kim was dead.

15:13.509 --> 15:16.128
Because you never remember
who I am.

15:16.129 --> 15:18.046
First year, we hung out,
like, ten times.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.098
And each time,
you introduced yourself to me.

15:20.099 --> 15:21.633
That's why I wrote that note.

15:21.634 --> 15:23.918
And then today, it's like
you still don't remember me.

15:23.919 --> 15:26.188
And... and you still assume
from my name that I am a girl.

15:26.189 --> 15:28.807
I had no choice but to make up
that awesome story

15:28.808 --> 15:31.393
about a dead chick to hurt you
like you hurt me.

15:31.394 --> 15:35.530
I am so sorry...

15:35.531 --> 15:37.532
Kim.
Right?

15:37.533 --> 15:40.702
Do you know how long I've
waited to hear you say that?

15:42.538 --> 15:44.573
What the hell is this crap?

15:44.574 --> 15:46.458
Annie, this is Kim.

15:46.459 --> 15:47.793
I think because he had
a girl's name,

15:47.794 --> 15:49.127
I never took him seriously.

15:49.128 --> 15:50.912
It happens literally
all the time,

15:50.913 --> 15:53.948
which is insane because 16%
of all people named Kim are men.

15:53.949 --> 15:56.718
- [Chuckles] I'm sorry, buddy.
- Don't apologize to this guy.

15:56.719 --> 15:59.871
- You told me to apologize.
- To a dead girl's locker.

15:59.872 --> 16:03.425
I thought I was
representing the sisterhood.

16:03.426 --> 16:04.626
Thought I was
teaching you a lesson

16:04.627 --> 16:06.762
about all the girls
you dominate

16:06.763 --> 16:08.146
and then ignore.

16:08.147 --> 16:11.516
Not to waste your energy
on some weird, cloying,

16:11.517 --> 16:14.302
hypersensitive stalker
with a girl's name.

16:14.303 --> 16:16.321
Hey!
You are really mean.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.770
Put it in a letter,
Jane Austen.

16:20.827 --> 16:24.813
Prepare to initiate
Protocol Omega.

16:24.814 --> 16:27.949
Good-bye, pillow fort.
You were a beautiful dream.

16:27.950 --> 16:31.319
More than a dream.
It's here.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.487
Who are you?

16:32.488 --> 16:34.039
Someone who understands
dedication

16:34.040 --> 16:36.991
to craftsmanship
in the face of mediocrity.

16:36.992 --> 16:39.678
This world is run
by the unremarkables.

16:39.679 --> 16:41.997
Don't do what you always do,
Abed.

16:41.998 --> 16:44.999
Don't corrupt the host
to pacify the parasites.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.084
Ask yourself...

16:46.085 --> 16:49.654
"What if I stopped worrying
about their acceptance of me?"

16:49.655 --> 16:53.191
What if it fell
to the Reggies of the world

16:53.192 --> 16:57.295
to keep up with the inspectors
or perish?

16:57.296 --> 17:01.416
Now please turn your head
while I crawl away.

17:01.417 --> 17:04.986
I'm going through some stuff
right now.

17:04.987 --> 17:07.756
I'm very insecure.

17:09.525 --> 17:10.692
What's going on?

17:10.693 --> 17:12.611
I'll ask the questions here.

17:12.612 --> 17:15.497
You had sex with Subway,
and I recorded it.

17:15.498 --> 17:17.699
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.335
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

17:20.336 --> 17:21.887
You know what, I'm going
to let this one slide.

17:21.887 --> 17:22.887
- What?
- What?

17:22.888 --> 17:23.888
I know we have
very strict rules

17:23.890 --> 17:25.390
against romantic entanglements

17:25.391 --> 17:28.560
with our corpohumanoids,
but at this point in time,

17:28.560 --> 17:30.896
we can't stop them
from having hearts.

17:30.897 --> 17:33.315
These two are clearly in love.

17:33.316 --> 17:34.983
If they want
to express that love

17:34.984 --> 17:38.937
in a perfectly healthy way,
then... okay, hold on.

17:38.938 --> 17:41.173
Th... is this
what I think it is?

17:42.725 --> 17:44.843
That got unhealthy real quick.

17:44.844 --> 17:47.045
That... okay, that's...
yeah, that's weird.

17:47.046 --> 17:49.247
That is well out
of the mainstream.

17:49.248 --> 17:50.532
You know,
I was raised in the...

17:50.533 --> 17:53.234
the Bay Area, but I...
I'm a father now.

17:53.235 --> 17:55.069
[Clears throat]

17:55.070 --> 17:58.206
Subway cannot stand for that,
and frankly, Rick,

17:58.207 --> 18:00.742
- I-I'm surprised you did.
- My name is Subway.

18:00.743 --> 18:02.410
Not anymore.

18:02.411 --> 18:04.379
- The bread is stale.
- No! No!

18:04.380 --> 18:06.882
- Oh, my God.
- Subway, I love you!

18:06.883 --> 18:08.049
- Britta!
- Shut up.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.551
[Whispers]
How could you?

18:09.552 --> 18:13.472
Well, if that'll be all,
I'll be on my way.

18:13.473 --> 18:16.691
If someone could
hand me my jacket.

18:16.692 --> 18:19.110
It's right over there on
the coatrack next to the door.

18:19.111 --> 18:22.080
If somebody could just hand it
to me, that would be great.

18:25.318 --> 18:26.768
I guess I'm confused.

18:26.769 --> 18:28.436
Why don't you just grab it
on your way out the door...

18:28.437 --> 18:30.322
You know what?
Now I'm not leaving.

18:30.323 --> 18:32.407
Now I'm just going
to sit for a while

18:32.408 --> 18:36.127
and focus on how unacceptable
today was.

18:36.128 --> 18:38.630
Jeff.

18:38.631 --> 18:40.832
I wanted to apologize.

18:40.833 --> 18:44.619
I never realized I had my own
issues regarding gender roles,

18:44.620 --> 18:47.556
and it was certainly unfair
of me to take them out on Kim.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.140
Mm.

18:49.141 --> 18:51.793
Who's Kim?

18:51.794 --> 18:54.679
Corporate America
has destroyed love.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.983
- Again?
- Subway!

18:57.984 --> 19:01.135
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

19:01.136 --> 19:03.972
Britta, you silly.
It is me, Subway.

19:03.973 --> 19:05.440
What?

19:05.441 --> 19:07.659
I had a great time with you
last night in the pillow fort,

the deviant sex act

19:10.246 --> 19:13.193
you initiated
without my consent.

Aah!

19:18.988 --> 19:20.321
- Whoa!
- Oh, jeez.

19:20.322 --> 19:22.657
There is a situation
developing in the study room.

19:22.658 --> 19:24.543
I would elaborate,
but I am out of breath

19:24.544 --> 19:26.344

Calm! Down!

19:35.304 --> 19:38.006
- What's going on here?
- Abed won't tear down his fort.

19:38.007 --> 19:39.841
I shouldn't have to compromise
my craftsmanship

19:39.842 --> 19:41.776
- to placate mediocrity.
- Mediocrity?

19:41.777 --> 19:43.778
Okay, b...
boys, boys.

19:43.779 --> 19:46.114
The Guinness rep will be here
in two days.

19:46.115 --> 19:49.350
Can we just flip a coin
to decide who has to back down?

19:49.351 --> 19:50.652
- No.
- No.

19:50.653 --> 19:53.187
Well, I'm Dean,
so I'm making the call.

Sir, it appears that
Troy Barnes' blanket fort

20:49.292 --> 20:51.643
may go to war with Abed Nadir's
pillow fort.

20:51.644 --> 20:52.795
Of course.

Soon Troy and Abed
will be torn asunder,

Yes.
