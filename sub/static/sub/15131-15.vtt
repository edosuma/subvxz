WEBVTT

00:00.977 --> 00:02.810
[siren wailing]

00:02.812 --> 00:04.979
Patient presents with a distended stomach,

00:04.981 --> 00:07.648
paranoia, and brown urine.

00:07.650 --> 00:08.683
Okay, symptoms like that,

00:08.685 --> 00:10.518
this guy should be from another planet.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.852
- Porphyria.
- Aah.

00:11.854 --> 00:13.688
[inhales sharply]
I'm 0 for 4 on this module.

00:13.690 --> 00:15.690
Like, I can't even draw a walk.

00:15.692 --> 00:17.009
Maybe we can change that.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.296
Dr. Harris.

00:18.399 --> 00:19.860
Hi. Kind of in a rush here.

00:19.862 --> 00:21.161
What are the chances

00:21.163 --> 00:23.998
that you could give our
study group a mock oral exam?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.833
Slim to none.

00:25.835 --> 00:27.334
- Alex will be there.
- Great. I won't.

00:27.336 --> 00:28.469
It wouldn't take long.

00:28.471 --> 00:31.038
Listen, guys, I-I just really got to go.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.374
Got this whole real life-and-death thing.

00:34.376 --> 00:35.476
[sighs]

00:35.478 --> 00:37.978
Okay, sink or swim. It's an approach.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.147
[clicks tongue] Yeah.

00:40.149 --> 00:41.781
See? I have another idea.

00:41.783 --> 00:43.283
- [sighs]
- Hey, there he is.

00:43.285 --> 00:45.619
Why don't you go ahead
and ask me why I'm late?

00:45.621 --> 00:47.454
You're right on time.

00:47.456 --> 00:51.024
In my E.R.,
on time is 15 minutes early.

00:51.026 --> 00:53.192
Okay, why are you late?

00:53.194 --> 00:55.028
Female, 28, swerved in front

00:55.030 --> 00:57.631
of a commuter train coming from Georgetown.

00:57.633 --> 01:00.800
I was on said train... hence late.

01:00.802 --> 01:02.802
You don't live in Georgetown.

01:02.804 --> 01:05.805
True. But that's a different story.

01:05.807 --> 01:06.806
[exhales deeply]

01:06.808 --> 01:09.142
Okay, humerus broken in three places,

01:09.144 --> 01:11.977
open femoral fracture, massive blood loss.

01:11.979 --> 01:13.446
Yeah, she's down two pints.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.047
Artery gushed like a fire hose

01:15.049 --> 01:16.649
till I got a tourniquet on it.

01:16.651 --> 01:19.318
- If she doesn't bleed out...
- She might lose her leg.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.154
Um, can she feel her toes?

01:21.156 --> 01:22.988
Why don't you ask her? Oh, wait.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.458
Actually, we have to enter
from the right side.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.660
What?

01:27.662 --> 01:28.827
Yeah, she prefers that.

01:28.829 --> 01:32.164
Also, I got to go first 'cause I'm a brunet.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.331
Elaine: [breathing shakily]

01:33.333 --> 01:35.834
Elaine, this is Dr. Harris.

01:35.836 --> 01:37.335
He's gonna fix you up real good, okay?

01:37.337 --> 01:38.837
Hi, Elaine.

01:38.839 --> 01:40.505
There needs to be three doctors.

01:40.507 --> 01:42.864
Trust me, you do not want
that wish to come true.

01:42.914 --> 01:43.675
- Be careful.
- [whimpers]

01:43.677 --> 01:45.177
Let's take this off.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.678
Things need to be in threes.

01:47.231 --> 01:49.947
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say that you have OCD, right, Elaine?

01:49.949 --> 01:52.348
I'm obsessive and compulsive, yes.

01:52.398 --> 01:53.116
- [breathes deeply]
- Okay.

01:53.119 --> 01:54.879
[monitor beeping]
Oh, got a bit of a spike in her heart rate.

01:54.929 --> 01:57.021
It's anxiety. Three is my number.

01:57.023 --> 01:58.690
Okay, let us do our job.

01:58.692 --> 02:02.285
Yeah, I know. Girl with OCD,
it's a drag for you.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.195
Well, I heard you had quite a morning.

02:04.197 --> 02:06.297
What made you want to bike
in front of a train?

02:06.299 --> 02:09.667
I went left. I never go left.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.335
Well, you almost got yourself killed.

02:11.337 --> 02:14.871
Okay, can you feel this?

02:14.873 --> 02:16.340
Barely.

02:16.342 --> 02:18.509
And wiggle your toes.

02:18.511 --> 02:20.944
Okay, well, let's worry
about getting this fixed.

02:20.946 --> 02:22.446
Um, how much do you weigh?

02:22.448 --> 02:23.780
Uh, it's not a prime number.

02:23.782 --> 02:25.115
Okay, let's go with, uh,

02:25.117 --> 02:27.284
601 milligrams of clindamycin

02:27.286 --> 02:30.394
and, um, about a million penicillin G.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.848
- For germs?
- No.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.657
For infection. Um, don't worry.

02:34.659 --> 02:36.927
You're going to the, uh,
cleanest room in the hospital.

02:40.998 --> 02:42.665
Hello.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.167
I've been waiting for you.

02:44.169 --> 02:46.502
I didn't know
that we had an appointment.

02:46.504 --> 02:48.003
Did you miss me?

02:48.005 --> 02:49.839
Did you steal those crackers?

02:49.841 --> 02:51.874
They're free in the cafeteria.

02:51.876 --> 02:54.844
Only if you buy the soup.
Did you buy the soup?

02:58.582 --> 03:01.484
What are you doing here, Giselle?

03:01.486 --> 03:03.085
Followed my feet.

03:03.087 --> 03:04.586
Shouldn't you be in school?

03:04.588 --> 03:06.889
It's teacher-development day.

03:08.591 --> 03:10.126
I'm calling social services.

03:12.229 --> 03:14.230
[sighs] [drawer opens]

03:14.232 --> 03:16.732
How are things with your foster family?

03:16.734 --> 03:18.567
They eat rabbits.

03:18.569 --> 03:21.903
Well, you can't stay here.

03:21.905 --> 03:23.838
There's a dust vac over there

03:23.840 --> 03:26.174
if you'd like to clean up your crumbs.

03:26.176 --> 03:28.677
Hi. Can I speak with Mr. Perez, please?

03:28.679 --> 03:30.679
You said you were coming to Leila's funeral.

03:30.681 --> 03:31.780
You never did.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.449
Yeah, I know, and I wanted to.

03:34.451 --> 03:36.718
I just, um...

03:36.720 --> 03:38.253
[siren wails in distance]

03:38.255 --> 03:40.588
Hi. Mr. Perez, yes.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.757
It's Dr. Bell from Hope Zion.

03:42.759 --> 03:43.892
I...

03:49.337 --> 03:50.643
Mr. Helperin.

03:51.472 --> 03:53.474
- I'm Dr. Alex Reid.
- Uh-huh.

03:53.476 --> 03:55.877
Says here that
you took a tumble off a stage.

03:56.092 --> 03:57.378
[gasping] Yep.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.048
A bad dress rehearsal, good opening...

04:00.050 --> 04:02.217
at least, uh, that's what I'm hoping.

04:02.219 --> 04:03.884
And you're having trouble
catching your breath?

04:03.886 --> 04:06.387
Yeah, I'm pr... probably just winded.

04:06.389 --> 04:09.657
My students [exhales] insisted I come in.

04:09.659 --> 04:11.158
- Yeah, they won't leave the waiting room.
- Oh.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.360
You must be a great teacher.

04:12.362 --> 04:14.829
Uh, maybe,
but I make a terrible ghost.

04:14.831 --> 04:16.096
[laughs]

04:17.072 --> 04:19.457
- Mind if I take a look?
- Of course.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.935
I have an auditorium full...

04:21.938 --> 04:24.104
full of, uh, parents coming to see

04:24.106 --> 04:26.941
the production of "Hamlet," uh, tonight, s...

04:26.943 --> 04:28.575
- Whoa. Okay.
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

04:28.577 --> 04:31.212
Okay, you definitely have
a couple of broken ribs here.

04:31.214 --> 04:33.914
Just patch me up, okay?
I can't let them down.

04:34.591 --> 04:36.433
Let me take a closer look, all right?

04:36.483 --> 04:37.676
Now, it's gonna be tender.

04:37.726 --> 04:39.419
- [clicking]
- [groans]

04:39.421 --> 04:42.589
[weakly] Uh, "I am thy father's spirit."

04:42.591 --> 04:44.358
[breathing rapidly]

04:47.391 --> 04:48.628
I'm sorry. What?

04:48.630 --> 04:50.731
Oh, I'm just practicing my lines.

04:50.733 --> 04:52.098
I'm playing the ghost.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.933
Right. Of course. [beep]

04:53.935 --> 04:56.102
Well, there is no bleeding in your abdomen,

04:56.104 --> 04:58.071
so we will get you on oxygen
and up for an X-ray.

04:58.073 --> 04:59.839
Then we'll have an idea of what's going on.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.575
[breathes deeply]

05:06.580 --> 05:09.915
"I am thy father's... spirit,"

05:09.917 --> 05:13.952
"doomed for a certain term
to walk the night."

[elevator bell dings]

05:25.095 --> 05:27.128
[indistinct talking over P.A.]

05:30.515 --> 05:31.953
Maggie.

05:33.470 --> 05:35.103
I was actually just thinking of you.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.214
- Oh, yeah?
- Huh.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.440
We got this.

05:39.442 --> 05:42.001
It was an engagement gift.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.945
I mean, there's un-kosher,
and then there's...

05:44.947 --> 05:47.548
"Daddy crab legs crab shack."

05:47.879 --> 05:51.051
Yeah, a business acquaintance
of Herschel's didn't know.

05:51.053 --> 05:53.721
Or he did,
and he gave it to you anyway.

05:53.723 --> 05:55.322
A non-gift gift. [chuckles]

05:55.976 --> 05:58.405
I thought maybe you could use it.

05:58.894 --> 06:01.561
Is this my... parting gift?

06:01.563 --> 06:02.730
Crack some crab legs

06:02.732 --> 06:04.698
and forget about what happened between us?

06:04.700 --> 06:07.034
No. I just thought
it would be a nice treat.

06:07.036 --> 06:09.169
You never treat yourself.

06:09.171 --> 06:12.872
Yeah, I'm... sort of allergic to shellfish,

06:12.874 --> 06:14.707
but thank you. [elevator bell dings]

06:18.469 --> 06:20.612
Sort of?

06:21.416 --> 06:23.583
- Charlie, hey.
- Hey.

06:23.585 --> 06:25.185
I need an ortho consult on a ghost.

06:25.187 --> 06:26.853
You, uh, w-what?

06:26.855 --> 06:28.655
High-school production
of "Hamlet" gone wrong.

06:28.657 --> 06:31.590
Oh. When do they ever go right?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.592
Could you take a look
at the patient's ribs for me?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.528
Yeah. [sighs]

06:35.530 --> 06:37.163
Wow.

06:37.165 --> 06:39.866
Also, I, uh, had something
that I needed to ask you.

06:39.868 --> 06:41.701
Dr. Harris, just finished
prepping the patient.

06:41.703 --> 06:43.369
Okay, I'll be right there. [sighs]

06:43.371 --> 06:44.703
Just waiting on you and Dr. Lin, sir.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.372
O... Kay.

06:46.374 --> 06:47.839
You've got bigger fish to fry. Go.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.141
- [sighs] I'm sorry.
- It's...

06:53.079 --> 06:57.082
[sighs]

07:00.687 --> 07:01.987
Hello.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.823
Uh, this is Dr. Maggie Lin
calling from Hope Zion.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.658
I was hoping that you could fax over

07:06.660 --> 07:10.162
some medical records of a deceased patient.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.529
Yes.

07:13.866 --> 07:17.034
Frank J. Reid.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.869
[drill whirring]

07:20.806 --> 07:22.473
How's that artery coming, Maggie?

07:22.475 --> 07:23.941
Couple more stitches.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.510
Good.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.181
It's kind of nice to see me so still.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.984
Uh...

07:33.986 --> 07:35.820
She's got to be on the other side of you.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.788
She's not going anywhere.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.657
That's my superpower.

07:40.659 --> 07:44.661
[breathing heavily]
It has to be boy, girl, boy.

07:44.663 --> 07:45.730
Okay, I'm done. Got it?

07:45.732 --> 07:47.598
Not a dinner party.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.066
[whimpers]

07:49.068 --> 07:50.800
Sorry... was I acting like it was?

07:50.802 --> 07:54.304
No. Bulldog clamps.

07:54.306 --> 07:56.973
Clamps coming off.

07:56.975 --> 07:59.109
Closing stitches.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.111
It... it has to be boy, girl, boy.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.779
[sighs]

08:02.781 --> 08:04.948
This is not good. This is not good.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.515
[monitor beeping] Heart rate's spiking.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.684
- Ohh! Okay!
- What? I don't get it.

08:08.686 --> 08:09.986
My graft is fine.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.654
I'm freaking out here, Charlie.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.656
[sighs]

08:15.126 --> 08:17.526
Rian, change places with Maggie.

08:17.528 --> 08:20.263
- What?
- Sorry. What? Why?

08:20.265 --> 08:23.466
You should learn to operate
from any position at the table.

08:26.836 --> 08:28.504
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go, go, go.

08:28.506 --> 08:30.205
[breathing heavily]

08:32.876 --> 08:34.243
[sighs]

08:36.346 --> 08:39.148
Oh. False alarm. It's coming down.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.515
Better?

08:41.518 --> 08:43.952
[sighs]

08:43.953 --> 08:45.620
Me? Uh... yeah, I guess.

08:48.724 --> 08:52.227
Wait, what just happened?

08:52.229 --> 08:54.163
It's like a curtain just went over my eyes.

08:56.198 --> 08:58.032
I can't see!

09:00.035 --> 09:02.504
[sighs] So...

09:02.506 --> 09:03.838
Are we canceling the show?

09:03.840 --> 09:06.341
No, we are not canceling the show, Harry.

09:06.343 --> 09:08.576
Mr. H., You can't go onstage like that.

09:08.578 --> 09:09.778
Oh, Tia, come on.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.379
It's just a couple of [inhales] broken ribs.

09:11.381 --> 09:13.881
They'll tape me up, give me some ibuprofen.

09:13.883 --> 09:15.082
This show is happening.

09:15.084 --> 09:17.218
I'm so sorry. Am I interrupting
rehearsals here?

09:17.220 --> 09:20.221
That's your cue, Hamlet.

09:20.223 --> 09:21.856
Come on. Let's go run some lines.

09:21.858 --> 09:24.313
Great idea, Harry. I'll come find you after
and tell you what's going on,

09:24.377 --> 09:26.025
- Okay, guys?
- All right.

09:26.137 --> 09:28.629
Okay, I shall be
playing the role of Dr. Goran.

09:28.631 --> 09:29.996
Hi.

09:29.998 --> 09:35.001
Uh, Dr. Reid asked me
to take a look at these X-rays.

09:35.003 --> 09:38.038
I'm just going to examine you right now.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.540
All right,
take a deep breathe for me.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.674
[breathes deeply]

09:40.676 --> 09:42.676
Aah.

09:42.678 --> 09:45.345
"I am thy father's spirit."

09:45.347 --> 09:47.347
Oh, I can't remember my lines.

09:47.349 --> 09:48.722
Oh, memory's not what it used to be.

09:48.802 --> 09:51.584
Yeah, it's probably just a side effect
of the pain medication we gave you.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.054
"Doomed... doomed..."

09:54.056 --> 09:56.422
"Doomed for a certain term
to walk the night"?

09:57.361 --> 09:58.358
Do you know it?

09:58.360 --> 10:01.094
Barely, but, yeah, I do know.

10:01.096 --> 10:02.261
[inhales sharply] Aah!

10:02.263 --> 10:03.730
Okay, obviously that's not good.

10:03.732 --> 10:05.732
I'm gonna get you into an O.R. right now.

10:05.734 --> 10:06.899
No!

10:06.901 --> 10:08.768
It's not an option, sir.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.069
[sighs] I teach remedial english.

10:10.071 --> 10:11.674
This production is the culmination

10:11.742 --> 10:12.871
of an entire year's work.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.774
- If they don't do it...
- You're going to have to postpone it.

10:14.776 --> 10:15.941
- No.
- Okay?

10:15.943 --> 10:17.910
It means so much to them.

10:17.912 --> 10:19.078
Listen to me.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.613
Your health is a priority right now, okay?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.584
[exhales deeply]

10:25.586 --> 10:27.452
Somebody made a mistake.

10:27.454 --> 10:29.721
Are... are we triple-checking?

10:29.723 --> 10:31.456
Because I really can't see.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.791
[crying, breathing heavily]

10:32.793 --> 10:33.926
Okay, breathe.

10:33.928 --> 10:36.795
Just... breathe.

10:36.797 --> 10:38.463
Yeah, I'm breathing.

10:46.972 --> 10:49.641
Okay, Rian, close.

10:49.643 --> 10:51.609
Yes... yes, sir.

10:51.611 --> 10:53.611
Stapler.

10:57.182 --> 10:58.582
How are her numbers?

10:58.584 --> 10:59.884
Fine.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.988
Charlie! Please help me!

11:03.990 --> 11:06.657
Okay, popquiz...
what are the potential hazards

11:06.659 --> 11:08.459
of operating on a patient
in a prone position?

11:08.461 --> 11:10.461
Uh, it could put pressure on the optic nerve

11:10.463 --> 11:11.962
and may cause blindness.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.031
Blind! I'm going blind!

11:14.033 --> 11:16.500
- Okay, let's move her.
- Oh.
- What?

11:16.502 --> 11:18.702
Uh... wait. Are... are you
seeing something I'm not?

11:18.704 --> 11:21.539
Yeah, I don't want her
to go blind, so let's roll her.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.707
Rian, arms out. She's coming over to you.

11:24.054 --> 11:26.310
Okay. Uh, let's move her on three.

11:26.312 --> 11:30.213
On three... one, two, three...

11:30.215 --> 11:32.549
[monitor beeping]

11:32.551 --> 11:33.917
Thank you.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.521
[drill whirring]

11:42.059 --> 11:43.660
[sighs]

11:46.163 --> 11:48.832
- Howdy.
- Hey, Neil.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.834
I'd love to get your eyes on this, please.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.335
Hmm.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.003
Well, you know I like a good mystery.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.038
Well, this one is bizarre.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.427
Wow, there's fibrotic tissue
where the bone should be.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.409
Mm-hmm.
I've read about it before.

12:00.411 --> 12:01.643
I've never actually seen it.

12:01.645 --> 12:02.518
Neither have I.

12:03.031 --> 12:03.979
What do you think it is?

12:03.982 --> 12:06.515
My money is on vanishing bone disease.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.351
Seriously? That's what it's called?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.353
- That's what it's called.
- That's what it's called.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.688
Well, the plot thickens.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.523
Tell you what,
if there is a spot like this,

12:14.525 --> 12:16.191
- there's probably more.
- Yeah, agreed.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.493
Uh, I'm gonna send him up
for a full-body C.T.

12:17.495 --> 12:19.495
Right after I excise this tissue.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.329
Good idea.

12:21.331 --> 12:23.565
- Well, tell you what...
- What's that?

12:23.567 --> 12:25.734
If we are right,

12:25.736 --> 12:27.569
then I would be happy to co-author

12:27.571 --> 12:29.070
any paper that you want to publish.

12:29.619 --> 12:31.845
[camera shutter clicking]
All right? You're welcome.

12:31.895 --> 12:33.199
Cheers.

12:33.776 --> 12:35.810
[indistinct conversations]

12:42.151 --> 12:44.819
That was Leila's bed, wasn't it?

12:44.821 --> 12:48.489
Guess she's just trying
to stay close to her foster mom.

12:48.491 --> 12:52.660
It'd be sad
if it wasn't so heartbreaking.

12:52.662 --> 12:55.162
Why do you have an empty bed?

12:55.164 --> 12:58.666
The patient's upstairs
in a 10-hour liver surgery.

12:58.668 --> 13:01.002
Want me to wake her up and boot her out?

13:01.004 --> 13:02.670
No.

13:02.672 --> 13:04.838
At least I'll know where she is

13:04.840 --> 13:07.041
when the social worker gets here.

13:10.645 --> 13:14.248
Oh, god. Gray just turned black.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.783
I thought rolling her would fix it.

13:16.785 --> 13:19.186
- I'm sorry. Fix what?
- Check her pupils.

13:19.188 --> 13:20.420
Wayne: You want me to un-tape her

13:20.422 --> 13:23.823
and potentially mess up
her airway on a hunch?

13:23.825 --> 13:25.391
Hunch?! Tell him I'm telling you!

13:25.393 --> 13:27.427
Doesn't work that way.

13:27.429 --> 13:28.562
I know, which is why I wouldn't do it.

13:28.564 --> 13:30.396
You got to do it. It could be a stroke.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.698
No, blood flow is getting
to her brain just fine.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.400
- Then the monitors could be off.
- They're never off.

13:34.402 --> 13:36.235
Sir, why don't we just take her to ICU?

13:36.237 --> 13:37.770
- No!
- No!

13:37.772 --> 13:38.904
Wayne: Wait a minute. Hold on.
[monitor beeping]

13:38.906 --> 13:42.808
Brain function's dropping. What the hell?

13:42.810 --> 13:45.744
Elaine: [crying]

13:45.746 --> 13:47.246
Okay, pupil's blown.

13:47.248 --> 13:49.082
It's got to be a hematoma.
Rian, call Shahir.

13:49.084 --> 13:51.850
Yes, sir. Uh, can you please grab my phone?

13:51.852 --> 13:54.019
- Thank you.
- What's happening?

13:54.021 --> 13:56.154
The hematoma's
putting pressure on the brain.

13:56.156 --> 13:59.157
We've got to get her ready. Table to 45.

13:59.159 --> 14:00.659
Uh, Dr. Harris needs you
for an urgent craniotomy.

14:00.661 --> 14:02.928
Ask him how we can prep.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.329
Brain function is down to 39.

14:04.331 --> 14:05.330
He says take her to imaging.

14:05.332 --> 14:07.199
BP's elevated, and she's brady.

14:07.201 --> 14:08.467
Okay, there's no time. Where is he?

14:08.469 --> 14:09.501
He's on the elevator, sir.

14:09.503 --> 14:11.869
[sighs] Betadine.

14:11.871 --> 14:13.538
Wayne: Brain function
is <i>still</i> dropping!

14:13.540 --> 14:15.507
- He's on the ninth floor.
- Ohh! This is...

14:15.509 --> 14:17.509
this is my worst migraine!

14:17.511 --> 14:18.977
He just stopped on the eighth floor, sir.

14:18.979 --> 14:22.647
Okay, ask Shahir, if the pupil
is blown on the left side,

14:22.649 --> 14:24.983
is the hematoma on the same side
or the opposite side?

14:24.985 --> 14:26.017
Same, same.

14:26.019 --> 14:27.719
Where?! Be specific.

14:27.721 --> 14:30.989
He says be specific!

14:30.991 --> 14:33.324
[sobbing]

14:33.326 --> 14:36.327
Charlie, what are you doing?

14:37.696 --> 14:38.763
Drill.

14:38.765 --> 14:40.264
Charlie, you are not a neurosurgeon.

14:40.266 --> 14:41.599
Maggie, be standing by with the suction.

14:41.601 --> 14:43.967
You can't just drill into somebody's head.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.836
Dr. Harris is going in.

14:45.838 --> 14:46.903
Dr. Hamza says wait.

14:46.905 --> 14:49.507
- We should wait.
- Charlie, she's coning.

14:49.509 --> 14:50.841
[sighs]

14:50.843 --> 14:53.110
She could die. We can't wait.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.913
[drill whirring]

15:10.862 --> 15:13.011
Why didn't you wait? Hmm? I was on my way.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.512
'Cause it would have been too late.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.849
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, but it was reckless.

15:16.851 --> 15:19.184
You should have taken her to imaging.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.886
- I saved her life.
- Yes, but how? Hmm?

15:20.888 --> 15:22.888
Every surgery has its algorithms,

15:22.890 --> 15:24.189
and you didn't follow any of them.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.191
No, no, I just used good,
old-fashioned doctoring.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.794
Dr. Sharpe said you picked up
on the stroke before the monitors did.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.962
Even I can't do that.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.764
I think you would have seen
this one, Shahir.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.031
Okay, this isn't funny, Charlie.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.867
I'm taking you to
the medical advisory committee.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.035
- Okay, Shahir, calm down.
- Hmm.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.904
I do think
that he has a point, Charlie.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.639
I think
everyone would appreciate it

15:41.641 --> 15:42.773
if you walked us through it.

15:43.519 --> 15:44.641
I'm sorry? Wh...

15:44.643 --> 15:45.977
Grand rounds this afternoon...

15:45.979 --> 15:47.979
you can explain your diagnosis
to your colleagues.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.883
Uh, public speaking...
not really my cup of tea, Dawn.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.217
Well, that's okay.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.152
We'll roll the tape,
and you can talk us through it.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.921
Yes, I like that.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.756
A window into the mind of Charlie Harris.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.924
It'll be enlightening for us all.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.861
I can feel it.

16:07.665 --> 16:09.666
Dawn.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.503
Dawn.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.637
You want to show everyone

16:13.639 --> 16:15.571
the O.R. footage
of the operation I just did?

16:15.573 --> 16:17.473
That's why we have cameras
in the operating room.

16:17.475 --> 16:19.075
No, we have cameras in the operating room

16:19.077 --> 16:20.277
in case something goes wrong,

16:20.279 --> 16:21.644
so we can learn from our mistakes.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.579
Or our successes.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.081
Okay.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.918
Sometimes I work
in a very instinctive way.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.186
I can't always explain everything.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.587
Maybe that's the problem.

16:31.589 --> 16:34.424
What's the problem?
I just saved a woman's life.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.591
I'm liable,

16:35.593 --> 16:38.093
and the whole hospital
is liable if she sues us.

16:38.095 --> 16:39.762
I did my job.

16:39.764 --> 16:41.597
Watch the tape.

16:41.599 --> 16:45.435
You used to be good at public speaking.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.904
Vanishing bone.

16:47.906 --> 16:48.938
Mm-hmm.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.307
It sounds like a magic trick.

16:51.309 --> 16:53.809
Uh, is it serious?

16:53.811 --> 16:56.511
If not treated aggressively, very.

16:56.513 --> 16:59.848
So, the scan revealed, uh,
further regions of missing bone.

16:59.850 --> 17:01.516
If I can get in there, excise those areas,

17:01.518 --> 17:03.152
you could beat this.

17:03.154 --> 17:04.685
- So let's do that.
- Great.

17:04.688 --> 17:07.856
I'll go book an O.R.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.958
[beep]

17:09.960 --> 17:11.660
Is he the father?

17:11.662 --> 17:13.962
What? I have vanishing bone disease.

17:13.964 --> 17:16.297
I could disappear any second.

17:16.299 --> 17:17.632
Mr. Helperin.

17:17.634 --> 17:20.134
When you've spent your entire life reading,

17:20.136 --> 17:22.636
you start to see everything as a...

17:22.637 --> 17:24.637
[chuckling] A Harlequin Romance?

17:24.640 --> 17:25.806
A story.

17:25.808 --> 17:26.874
Okay.

17:26.876 --> 17:29.543
You come from a... small town,

17:29.545 --> 17:32.347
gave you a work ethic, you have sisters.

17:32.349 --> 17:33.848
Brothers, actually.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.183
You see, what I don't know,
I simply make up...

17:35.185 --> 17:36.317
Pure fiction.

17:36.319 --> 17:38.486
Well, I am not a book.

17:38.488 --> 17:41.922
No. But everyone has a story, Julia.

17:41.924 --> 17:44.725
My name's Alex.

17:50.231 --> 17:51.765
Alex: - Joel.
- Yeah.

17:51.767 --> 17:55.268
I scheduled a psych consult
for our Mr. Helperin.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.603
I just booked the O.R.

17:56.605 --> 17:58.605
You said that
he experienced memory loss

17:58.607 --> 17:59.873
when you went to visit him pre-op.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.708
I told you that
he forgot some of his lines.

18:01.710 --> 18:02.942
He just called me Julia.

18:02.944 --> 18:04.277
Okay, that could be the anesthetic.

18:04.279 --> 18:06.413
I mean, think about how confused
you felt after your surgery.

18:06.415 --> 18:09.082
It's just...

18:09.084 --> 18:10.917
No, I read up
on vanishing bone disease.

18:10.919 --> 18:13.352
Psychiatric symptoms aren't
consistent with that diagnosis.

18:13.354 --> 18:14.453
[sighs]

18:14.455 --> 18:17.089
What do you want from me, Alex, honestly?

18:17.091 --> 18:18.457
I mean, you asked me for my opinion.

18:18.459 --> 18:20.292
I gave you my opinion.

18:20.294 --> 18:24.296
We need to operate, okay? Let's do that.

18:24.298 --> 18:26.399
[sighs]

18:26.401 --> 18:28.534
Mr. Perez, it's Dr. Bell... again.

18:28.536 --> 18:29.868
When you said an hour,

18:29.870 --> 18:32.704
I had some vague notion of 60 minutes.

18:32.706 --> 18:35.541
I am the chief of surgery at
a major metropolitan hospital,

18:35.543 --> 18:37.743
not some damn babysitter.

18:39.046 --> 18:41.880
Melanda?

18:41.882 --> 18:43.215
Where is she?

18:43.217 --> 18:44.716
Gone walkabout.

18:44.718 --> 18:46.384
I told you to keep an eye on her.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.854
Sorry, but I'm not actually used to patients

18:48.856 --> 18:50.822
who can get up and take a stroll.

18:50.824 --> 18:52.691
Call a code yellow.

18:55.461 --> 18:56.662
[intercom beeps]

18:56.664 --> 18:58.163
Okay, if we're going in for second opinions,

18:58.165 --> 18:59.431
you might
want to talk to Dr. Rocca.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.966
He agrees Helperin
has vanishing bone disease.

19:01.968 --> 19:03.401
Can't the surgery wait a day?

19:03.403 --> 19:05.370
I've got to get in there
and start pinning those bones.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.138
The longer we wait,
the more irreversible it is.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.473
Shouldn't we get the whole story first?

19:08.475 --> 19:11.842
An O.R. is available now.
I am available now.

19:11.844 --> 19:14.245
[alarm beeping] Doctors! Get in here!

19:19.585 --> 19:21.919
He's seizing!

19:21.921 --> 19:23.921
Mr. Helperin, you're gonna be all right.

19:23.923 --> 19:25.122
Man: Okay, what do you need?

19:25.124 --> 19:26.657
Clonazepam.

19:26.659 --> 19:28.358
Just gonna give you some oxygen.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.695
Let's flip him on three.
One, two, and three.

19:30.697 --> 19:31.963
Tia: Be careful with him.

19:31.965 --> 19:35.199
Clonazepam. You two shouldn't be in here.

19:35.201 --> 19:36.366
- Hold him.
- Let's go.

19:36.368 --> 19:38.268
[rapid beeping] Come on. Come on.

19:40.271 --> 19:42.272
What the hell's wrong with this guy?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.207
Ever since we started this play,

19:49.209 --> 19:51.217
Mr. Helperin's gotten worse.

19:51.545 --> 19:54.313
- He had a seizure last week.
- He what?

19:54.315 --> 19:55.701
He didn't want anyone to worry.

19:55.751 --> 19:58.651
- [sighs]
- I'm-I'm the assistant stage manager.

19:58.653 --> 19:59.818
I was cleaning up some props,

19:59.820 --> 20:02.521
and he kind of just... fell and was shaking.

20:02.523 --> 20:05.523
We would have booked
a brain MRI if we'd known.

20:05.525 --> 20:06.691
Okay, this is where we part company, guys.

20:07.199 --> 20:08.860
Wait, doesn't he have
family coming or something?

20:08.862 --> 20:10.862
Harry.

20:10.864 --> 20:12.363
Yeah, Mr. H.?

20:12.365 --> 20:14.732
The show must go on.

20:22.808 --> 20:25.310
Elaine: One, two, three.

20:25.312 --> 20:26.977
Anyone watching this tape
is gonna think I'm...

20:26.979 --> 20:28.479
Crazy?

20:28.481 --> 20:29.824
I was gonna say...

20:30.015 --> 20:32.817
stoned, but, yeah, crazy. Why not?

20:32.819 --> 20:35.320
[sighs] I could do this all day,

20:35.322 --> 20:40.124
but, uh, three's my number,
so I'll-I'll stop.

20:40.126 --> 20:41.725
Seriously, I-I-I can't
stand up and defend this.

20:41.727 --> 20:44.028
I broke like
12 different protocols in there.

20:44.030 --> 20:45.462
But you saved my life.

20:45.464 --> 20:47.832
Actually, you saved your own. [sighs]

20:47.834 --> 20:50.968
You listened to me.
Do you know how rare that is?

20:50.970 --> 20:53.704
<i>Breathe. Just... breathe.</i>

20:53.706 --> 20:57.006
It's all about perspective.

20:57.008 --> 20:58.642
People see what they want, I guess.

20:58.644 --> 21:00.477
Elaine, I look crazy.

21:00.479 --> 21:01.645
I-I-I-I'm... I'm-I'm seriously...

21:01.647 --> 21:03.347
I'm contemplating suing myself.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.415
I won't sue you. [sighs]

21:05.417 --> 21:08.084
That's very sweet, but you're
not gonna remember any of this.

21:08.086 --> 21:11.054
- Dr. Harris. We've been over the operation...
- [groans]

21:11.056 --> 21:13.923
And we just can't for the life of us
figure out how you did it.

21:13.925 --> 21:15.925
- And we have theories, but it's just...
- Yeah.

21:16.592 --> 21:17.727
Use them, dummy.

21:17.729 --> 21:19.662
[sighs] Come again?

21:19.664 --> 21:22.265
We each have theories, but...

21:22.267 --> 21:26.435
They have theories. You've got squat.

21:26.437 --> 21:27.837
Let them show you what they see.

21:31.941 --> 21:35.177
You two still interested
in that mock oral exam?

21:35.179 --> 21:36.779
Yes. Absolutely.

21:36.781 --> 21:38.781
Okay.

21:39.344 --> 21:41.016
Well, you figure out how I diagnosed

21:41.018 --> 21:44.186
this woman's paradoxical emboli
stroke on the operating table.

21:44.188 --> 21:46.521
You got two hours.

21:46.523 --> 21:49.191
[laughs] Seriously?

21:49.193 --> 21:50.425
Ticktock.

21:50.427 --> 21:52.627
Ticktock, okay.

21:52.629 --> 21:57.132
[chuckles] Okay.

21:57.134 --> 21:58.800
No, no, no, no,
you can't cut the ghost.

21:58.802 --> 22:01.369
Hamlet needs the ghost.
It's what urges the hero to...

22:01.371 --> 22:03.037
Alex: Hey.

22:03.039 --> 22:04.372
H-how's he doing?

22:04.374 --> 22:05.540
We're scanning him top to toe,

22:05.542 --> 22:07.041
and, uh,
when we get those images...

22:07.043 --> 22:08.075
You'll know what's wrong with him.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.578
[cellphone chimes] We hope.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.415
Great. Everyone's dropping out
of the play now.

22:13.417 --> 22:14.716
That's too bad. [sighs]

22:14.718 --> 22:16.651
Well, no one expected us to do it anyways.

22:16.653 --> 22:18.652
Now I have to go tell
my parents and my aunts

22:18.654 --> 22:20.154
and my grandparents that it's canceled.

22:20.156 --> 22:21.655
- Tia, no. Okay...
- No. You know what?

22:21.657 --> 22:26.093
They were... they were so proud
of me [sighs] for once.

22:27.963 --> 22:29.463
She's really good.

22:29.465 --> 22:31.299
And she's playing a boy.

22:31.301 --> 22:33.067
Can you do the play another night?

22:33.069 --> 22:35.101
It's a miracle
we're doing it one night.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.136
Why?

22:36.138 --> 22:38.472
Half the class is failing english.

22:38.474 --> 22:40.140
And then Mr. H. Said
that he would do the ghost,

22:40.142 --> 22:42.976
and we thought maybe we could do it.

22:42.978 --> 22:44.812
- Is he any good?
- Yeah.

22:44.814 --> 22:47.514
You really believe him,

22:47.516 --> 22:50.683
telling Hamlet to do it, go for it,

22:50.685 --> 22:52.518
do something.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.020
You know good teachers

22:54.022 --> 22:56.756
sometimes see something in us
that we can't see in ourselves.

22:56.758 --> 22:58.325
What does that mean?

22:58.327 --> 22:59.759
He believes in you.

22:59.761 --> 23:03.629
Yeah. But... he won't be there.
[cellphone chimes]

23:06.867 --> 23:08.067
Got to...

23:14.140 --> 23:15.475
[P.A. beeps]

23:15.477 --> 23:16.576
Dawn: Mind if I join you?

23:16.578 --> 23:17.910
Man: <i>Code yellow, adolescent female.</i>

23:17.912 --> 23:19.111
Free world.

23:19.113 --> 23:21.280
<i>Code yellow, adolescent female.</i>

23:21.282 --> 23:22.949
<i>Code yellow, adolescent female.</i>

23:22.951 --> 23:24.016
[P.A. beeps]

23:24.018 --> 23:27.019
Guess I'll cancel that code yellow.

23:27.021 --> 23:29.121
I was hoping that
you would be back at school.

23:29.123 --> 23:31.857
I was hoping you would save
my mother's life.

23:31.859 --> 23:33.892
Don't talk with your mouth full.

23:33.894 --> 23:37.496
This is why I like being
on my own, no one to bug me.

23:37.498 --> 23:41.132
I get that.

23:41.134 --> 23:42.968
What about you?

23:42.970 --> 23:44.970
What about me?

23:44.972 --> 23:46.838
Why are you always alone?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.208
I'm not.

23:50.210 --> 23:52.711
Uh, yeah.

23:52.713 --> 23:55.413
You're here sitting with me.
Don't you have friends?

23:55.415 --> 23:58.216
Sure I do.

23:58.218 --> 24:01.685
You're always here, always working.

24:01.687 --> 24:03.054
I have friends.

24:03.056 --> 24:05.390
Okay, you have friends.

24:05.392 --> 24:06.857
They're just all busy.

24:06.859 --> 24:09.593
Yeah, let's go with that.

24:09.595 --> 24:11.562
Cool.

24:11.564 --> 24:14.031
Cool.

24:14.033 --> 24:18.002
[crunching]

24:20.672 --> 24:22.506
Shahir: Unfortunately,
the MRI is inconclusive,

24:22.508 --> 24:25.308
though there appears to be
small lesions here and here.

24:25.310 --> 24:27.344
Okay, what else do we know?

24:27.346 --> 24:29.846
What other symptoms does he have?

24:29.848 --> 24:31.948
Lytic lesions.

24:31.950 --> 24:33.550
- Missing bones.
- Yeah.

24:35.119 --> 24:36.653
Oh, uh, seizures. Mm-hmm.

24:38.022 --> 24:39.689
Okay, so what's the differential diagnosis

24:39.691 --> 24:42.426
if it's not vanishing bone disease?

24:42.428 --> 24:44.727
What about Langerhans cell histiocytosis?

24:44.729 --> 24:46.896
No, that would have presented in childhood.

24:46.898 --> 24:48.865
Yeah, the guy didn't break
a bone until he was in his 40s.

24:48.867 --> 24:51.668
Pick's disease. He had some memory issues.

24:51.718 --> 24:53.903
Yeah, I mean, whatever's happening, it...
it's affecting his brain.

24:53.905 --> 24:55.572
But if it's not showing up here
in the images...

24:55.574 --> 24:57.440
Then it's most likely genetic.

24:57.442 --> 25:00.209
Right, so the only way to prove
that is by doing a brain biopsy.

25:00.211 --> 25:01.778
[fingers snap]

25:01.780 --> 25:03.112
Yeah.

25:03.114 --> 25:04.413
You're up.

25:06.416 --> 25:09.785
[monitor beeping]

25:09.787 --> 25:12.621
I'm not waking up.

25:12.623 --> 25:15.458
I told you. I need three doctors.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.460
No, you just need yourself.

25:17.462 --> 25:18.760
What does that mean?

25:18.762 --> 25:20.128
It means I'm thinking

25:20.130 --> 25:22.330
you're liking being disembodied
a little bit too much.

25:22.332 --> 25:24.666
I get to be me here,

25:24.668 --> 25:26.668
do all the things my mind tells me to do,

25:26.670 --> 25:28.403
and nobody looks at me funny.

25:28.622 --> 25:32.674
Yeah, but you're still being led
by the voices in your head.

25:34.226 --> 25:36.644
I can't really explain it.

25:36.646 --> 25:40.348
I have a whole other
relationship with reality.

25:40.350 --> 25:41.749
You don't understand.

25:41.751 --> 25:43.951
Oh, I think you'd be surprised.

25:43.953 --> 25:48.456
My compulsions tell me
they're keeping me safe.

25:48.458 --> 25:49.690
They didn't work today.

25:49.692 --> 25:51.926
No, they didn't.

25:51.928 --> 25:54.996
But who would I be without them?

25:54.998 --> 25:57.665
I don't know.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.933
But I do know

25:58.935 --> 26:02.269
what it's like to cut yourself
off from people...

26:02.271 --> 26:03.604
Because you feel like

26:03.606 --> 26:06.874
you got to hide
a fundamental part of yourself.

26:06.876 --> 26:10.043
Talking to ghosts?

26:10.045 --> 26:13.147
Yeah. Gets kind of old fast.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.896
[monitor beeping]

26:37.898 --> 26:39.431
I'm opening the dura now.

26:44.237 --> 26:46.738
Are you comfortable, Julia?

26:46.740 --> 26:49.374
Was Julia your wife?

26:49.376 --> 26:51.376
"Just one more round of tamoxifen"

26:51.378 --> 26:53.644
"and you are cancer-free."

26:53.646 --> 26:57.648
That's what the doctor said.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.484
[chuckles]

26:59.486 --> 27:01.586
She had breast cancer?

27:01.588 --> 27:03.554
Alex, he's getting agitated.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.656
Bill, it's okay.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.324
[breathing shakily]

27:07.326 --> 27:09.994
We were sitting on a dock.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.697
It was our 15th anniversary.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.567
And then she...

27:16.569 --> 27:18.436
She got worse?

27:18.438 --> 27:20.470
You...

27:22.573 --> 27:28.578
She... my Julia... died.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.282
I'm sorry, Bill.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.885
[indistinct conversations]

27:39.424 --> 27:42.592
Hey, you, uh...
you seen Dr. Lin or Larouche?

27:42.594 --> 27:44.528
No. Not yet.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.897
Okay, if everyone can take
your seats, please?

27:47.686 --> 27:48.732
So, I'm sure

27:48.734 --> 27:52.768
you're all aware of Dr. Harris'
miraculous save this morning.

27:52.770 --> 27:55.104
I thought this would be an opportunity

27:55.106 --> 27:57.773
to learn just how
this brilliant doctor does it.

27:57.775 --> 27:58.874
Charlie?

28:13.089 --> 28:14.757
[siren wailing in distance]

28:14.759 --> 28:16.024
Well...

28:18.962 --> 28:20.295
A friend of mine told me

28:20.297 --> 28:25.133
that everything is a matter of perception...

28:25.135 --> 28:28.236
or, I-I guess, perspective.

28:38.982 --> 28:43.485
You know, the truth is...

28:43.487 --> 28:45.353
I see things.

28:47.556 --> 28:51.559
I see things that...

28:51.561 --> 28:53.260
other people don't.

28:55.464 --> 28:57.799
And today I saw...

28:57.801 --> 29:00.167
Wait, wait. Sorry. Sorry we're late.

29:00.169 --> 29:02.003
Rian: Um, we figured out exactly
how you diagnosed Ms. Armitage,

29:02.005 --> 29:04.138
and we would-would love to present.

29:04.140 --> 29:07.808
That's... great.
It's like a-a locked-room mystery.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.843
I think this is Dr. Harris' lecture.

29:09.845 --> 29:11.845
Uh, well, hang on a second.

29:11.847 --> 29:14.215
Um... I think this is a great idea

29:14.217 --> 29:17.818
because we are, after all,
a teaching hospital, Dawn.

29:19.787 --> 29:21.287
Fine. You two have the floor.

29:21.289 --> 29:24.290
Thank you. Thank you.

29:24.292 --> 29:25.626
Thank you.

29:25.628 --> 29:26.827
Okay.

29:26.829 --> 29:29.396
[feedback] So, out of context,

29:29.398 --> 29:31.231
Dr. Harris does some...

29:31.233 --> 29:33.233
well, pretty strange things.

29:33.235 --> 29:34.467
Yes, he does.

29:38.339 --> 29:42.842
But we think we found
the reason in his madness.

29:42.844 --> 29:44.511
Check it out.

29:44.513 --> 29:46.046
Right here, and you see...

29:46.048 --> 29:48.313
Dr. Harris looks at the clamps.

29:48.315 --> 29:50.382
The clamp was blocking a clot

29:50.384 --> 29:53.318
that must have been forming in her vein.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.520
When I took the clamps off,

29:54.522 --> 29:57.089
the clot was released into her bloodstream.

29:57.091 --> 29:59.258
This was the first clue.

29:59.260 --> 30:02.929
This is the echocardiogram
taken of the patient's heart

30:02.931 --> 30:04.996
in the E.R.

30:04.998 --> 30:08.167
- This was the second clue.
- Yes.

30:08.169 --> 30:10.001
Mm. I don't see anything unusual with it.

30:10.003 --> 30:11.470
Exactly. See, we couldn't either.

30:11.472 --> 30:12.771
[chuckles]

30:12.773 --> 30:15.941
But if you look really closely,
see this area here?

30:15.943 --> 30:17.087
- Yes.
- It suggests

30:17.137 --> 30:18.942
blood flow between the chambers.

30:18.946 --> 30:22.180
Yes, and remember, Dr. Harris was once
married to a heart surgeon.

30:22.182 --> 30:24.515
Suspecting a heart problem,
we went up into the ICU

30:24.517 --> 30:27.185
and asked the patient if she
would consent to a bubble study.

30:27.187 --> 30:29.688
And she did, which is why we're late.

30:29.690 --> 30:30.922
[chuckles] Sorry.

30:30.924 --> 30:35.093
It shows that she has
patent foramen ovale...

30:35.095 --> 30:36.260
- a hole in her heart.
- Yes.

30:36.262 --> 30:37.761
The blood clot from her leg

30:37.763 --> 30:41.099
traveled through the hole
in her heart to her brain,

30:41.101 --> 30:43.901
causing the hematoma.

30:43.903 --> 30:45.703
Which is what Dr. Harris suspected.

30:45.705 --> 30:49.974
Yes, and he confirmed it
by looking at her pupils!

30:49.976 --> 30:51.242
It's amazing.

30:51.244 --> 30:53.511
Everybody clap. It's cool. [applause]

30:55.981 --> 30:57.648
It's amazing.

30:57.650 --> 31:00.784
[cellphone vibrates]

31:00.786 --> 31:02.586
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

31:02.588 --> 31:05.288
[clears throat]

31:05.290 --> 31:06.529
Thank you.

31:06.597 --> 31:09.727
Well, Charlie, unbelievable...

31:09.729 --> 31:12.629
yet... believable.

31:15.899 --> 31:17.900
Right.

31:17.902 --> 31:19.236
Uh, interesting.

31:19.238 --> 31:20.604
Thank you.

31:22.806 --> 31:25.808
She's smart but not big on authority.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.143
She's got spunk.

31:27.145 --> 31:28.811
Well, that's not really in fashion.

31:28.813 --> 31:30.146
I mean, sorry to put it that way,

31:30.148 --> 31:32.815
but potential parents
aren't looking for attitude.

31:32.817 --> 31:34.784
So, that's it? You've given up?

31:34.786 --> 31:36.919
No, I never give up, but let's face facts.

31:36.921 --> 31:39.088
I mean, Giselle's been through
three foster families...

31:39.090 --> 31:41.257
ran away from two,
the third one kicked her out.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.483
What about...

31:46.730 --> 31:51.600
Is there something between a
foster parent and a big sister?

31:53.203 --> 31:55.003
Jimmy: Wow, Maggie.

31:55.005 --> 31:57.706
That was some detective work back there.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.208
You're a regular Miss Marple.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.045
Is that how you see me...
as an aging spinster?

32:03.047 --> 32:04.345
Thank you.

32:04.347 --> 32:08.516
No, it's just, uh, you know,
how you solved this, uh...

32:08.518 --> 32:10.518
[inhales deeply] Okay, forget it.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.853
[clears throat]

32:11.855 --> 32:13.321
So, anyway, um, a friend of mine

32:13.323 --> 32:16.191
gave me this gift certificate
for a seafood restaurant,

32:16.193 --> 32:19.360
and I'm wondering if you'd like to go.

32:19.362 --> 32:21.696
How's that
celibacy experiment going?

32:21.698 --> 32:25.533
Uh, well, it's off... in theory.

32:25.535 --> 32:26.867
In theory?

32:26.869 --> 32:30.538
Yeah. Would you like to go?

32:30.540 --> 32:31.872
I would...

32:31.874 --> 32:34.975
In theory. [chuckles]

32:34.977 --> 32:38.312
Results of your brain biopsy came back.

32:38.314 --> 32:41.148
Mr. Helperin...

32:41.150 --> 32:42.983
you have a terminal illness.

32:42.985 --> 32:44.819
[monitor beeping]

32:44.821 --> 32:46.020
I'm dying?

32:46.022 --> 32:48.555
You have a genetically inherited condition

32:48.557 --> 32:50.490
called Nasu-Hakola disease.

32:50.492 --> 32:54.328
- Never heard of that.
- It's extremely rare.

32:54.330 --> 32:58.332
It also produces neurological deficits.

32:58.334 --> 32:59.999
Which is why you're forgetting things.

33:00.001 --> 33:04.504
The first manifestation of
the disease is the broken bones.

33:04.506 --> 33:07.406
Yeah, started breaking in my late 30s.

33:07.408 --> 33:10.243
Which is why, when I first saw you,

33:10.245 --> 33:11.911
it presented itself

33:11.913 --> 33:14.214
as what I believed
was vanishing bone disease.

33:14.216 --> 33:17.217
The psychiatric results ruled it out.

33:17.219 --> 33:18.918
Cut to the chase... how long have I got?

33:18.920 --> 33:20.519
It varies.

33:20.521 --> 33:22.055
Straight truth, damn it.

33:22.057 --> 33:23.389
No one with this condition

33:23.391 --> 33:25.924
has ever lived beyond 50, Mr. Helperin.

33:28.795 --> 33:30.296
That's a sad story.

33:30.298 --> 33:32.898
It's a difficult diagnosis, yes.

33:36.202 --> 33:41.907
When Julia died,
I devoted myself to teaching.

33:43.676 --> 33:46.044
Those kids are all I have.

33:52.685 --> 33:55.220
Of course,
all potential foster parents

33:55.222 --> 33:57.722
- have to submit to a psych evaluation.
- Okay.

33:57.724 --> 34:00.392
And then there'd be the home visit.

34:00.394 --> 34:02.894
No problem. My cleaning lady
is there from 10:00 to 3:00.

34:02.896 --> 34:06.398
Uh, no. [chuckles] Uh, visit's with you.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
Dawn, you'd have to cut back your hours.

34:08.402 --> 34:10.402
Giselle needs to be in first position.

34:10.404 --> 34:12.469
I-I-it's gonna be a big change.

34:17.509 --> 34:19.210
[siren wails in distance]

34:21.112 --> 34:24.282
One I couldn't possibly make.

34:24.284 --> 34:26.483
You should just take her. Take her away now.

34:51.272 --> 34:52.606
[sighs]

34:52.608 --> 34:56.143
So, we were able to confirm
that you had two strokes.

34:56.145 --> 34:58.478
The first one

34:58.480 --> 35:01.648
occurred when you were
bicycling alongside the train.

35:01.650 --> 35:04.984
You had what we call a sentinel bleed,

35:04.986 --> 35:07.487
which can affect your peripheral vision.

35:07.489 --> 35:10.144
So, that might explain why
I swerved in front of that train.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.760
Yes, and the second one, the major one,

35:12.762 --> 35:15.596
of course occurred when you
were on the operating table.

35:15.598 --> 35:17.531
Are these strokes gonna keep happening?

35:17.533 --> 35:19.199
No, now that we know it's there,

35:19.201 --> 35:22.202
we are going to fix the hole in your heart.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.203
[breathing shakily]

35:23.205 --> 35:25.372
I didn't see you wash your hands.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.374
Well, I did, but, uh, you do know

35:27.376 --> 35:31.010
there is such a thing
as good bacteria, right?

35:31.012 --> 35:35.582
Now, you mentioned having never
had restaurant food before.

35:35.584 --> 35:37.917
First you save me, and now
you're trying to kill me?

35:37.919 --> 35:40.419
Mm, baby steps.

35:40.421 --> 35:41.420
Really?

35:41.422 --> 35:42.922
And, uh...

35:42.924 --> 35:44.156
three's your number, right?

35:46.159 --> 35:47.860
I can't eat those.

35:49.630 --> 35:52.698
Elaine, you weren't hurt today
because you turned left.

35:54.167 --> 35:57.369
It wasn't faulty thinking...
it was a medical problem.

35:58.905 --> 36:00.739
And I don't think anything is gonna happen

36:00.741 --> 36:03.576
if you have three or...

36:03.578 --> 36:05.043
even one of those.

36:05.045 --> 36:08.379
You see a won ton...

36:08.381 --> 36:09.982
I see chaos.

36:09.984 --> 36:13.819
Well, that's a matter of perspective.

36:13.821 --> 36:16.989
And perspectives...

36:16.991 --> 36:19.390
can change.

36:32.070 --> 36:34.105
[vacuum whirring]

36:44.582 --> 36:47.051
[vacuum shuts off]

36:47.053 --> 36:49.754
[indistinct conversations]

36:49.756 --> 36:52.857
Wait. Wait.

36:52.859 --> 36:54.992
How long is it gonna take realistically

36:54.994 --> 36:56.793
to find Giselle a new situation?

36:56.795 --> 36:57.994
I don't know.

36:57.996 --> 37:00.464
Uh, it's Friday,
so certainly not before Monday.

37:00.466 --> 37:02.832
How about I take her for the weekend?

37:02.834 --> 37:04.034
For real?

37:04.036 --> 37:06.270
I'd have to call my supervisor,

37:06.272 --> 37:09.339
and you may have to have her
for as long as a week.

37:11.442 --> 37:14.610
[sighs]

37:14.612 --> 37:15.779
Okay.

37:15.781 --> 37:17.580
Make the call.

37:25.690 --> 37:28.024
[indistinct conversations]

37:28.026 --> 37:30.025
Where are you taking me?

37:30.027 --> 37:31.727
To Denmark.

37:35.465 --> 37:37.500
What is this?

37:39.303 --> 37:41.504
Your students did this for you.

37:45.342 --> 37:47.176
Where wilt thou lead me?

37:47.178 --> 37:48.510
Speak!

37:48.512 --> 37:50.846
I will go no further.

37:50.848 --> 37:52.748
I am thy father's spirit,

37:52.750 --> 37:56.251
doomed for a certain term to walk the night,

37:56.253 --> 38:00.488
and for the days,
confined to fast in fires...

38:00.490 --> 38:02.824
Till the foul crimes
done in my days of nature

38:02.826 --> 38:05.026
are burnt and purged away.

38:11.934 --> 38:14.569
But for that I am forbid

38:14.571 --> 38:16.438
to tell the secrets of my prison house,

38:16.440 --> 38:18.940
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

38:18.942 --> 38:22.110
would harrow up thy soul,
freeze thy young blood,

38:22.112 --> 38:26.214
make thy two eyes, like stars,
start from their spheres.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.416
Got your coat.

38:35.057 --> 38:36.390
Charlie.

38:36.392 --> 38:37.725
Dawn.

38:37.727 --> 38:39.059
You know Giselle?

38:39.061 --> 38:41.528
Uh, we haven't met officially. Hi.

38:41.530 --> 38:43.364
I'm staying with her for the weekend.

38:43.366 --> 38:45.699
Well, Dawn is tough but fair,

38:45.701 --> 38:47.468
and she's an excellent cook.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.970
Just so you know, I didn't buy

38:49.972 --> 38:52.105
Maggie and Rian's explanation for a second.

38:52.107 --> 38:54.440
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:54.442 --> 38:57.811
It was just you doing
your "whoo-whoo" thing.

38:57.813 --> 39:00.147
Well, I guess we'll never know.

39:00.149 --> 39:01.481
But to be fair,

39:01.483 --> 39:03.483
I wouldn't know a patent foramen ovale

39:03.485 --> 39:05.485
- from a hole in the heart.
- Mm.

39:05.487 --> 39:08.621
Everything I know about a broken
heart I learned from you.

39:08.623 --> 39:11.291
Ooh. Fail.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.293
Good night, Charlie.

39:13.295 --> 39:15.328
Good night.

39:17.564 --> 39:18.731
Maggie: We're early. [applause]

- [laughs]

39:20.034 --> 39:22.234
Maggie, Dr. Dey.

39:22.236 --> 39:25.737
Hey, uh, Sydney, thanks again for this.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.807
Enjoy your dinner.

39:27.809 --> 39:29.308
Tia: Get thee to a nunnery.

39:29.310 --> 39:32.077
Hey, you should come with us.

39:33.438 --> 39:35.915
I hear they have a kosher salad bar.

39:35.917 --> 39:38.684
Yeah. [clears throat]
You should come with us.

39:38.686 --> 39:41.020
That would be great.

39:41.022 --> 39:43.021
[Oh Wonder's "All We Do" plays]

39:43.023 --> 39:44.856

39:44.858 --> 39:46.858
Okay.

39:46.860 --> 39:48.226
Cool.
