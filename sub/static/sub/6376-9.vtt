00:02.502 --> 00:06.336
<i>Papi, I am so excited about
our Christmas dinner tonight!</i>

00:06.373 --> 00:08.603
I've been telling Matt all about
your traditional homemade tamales.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.336
- How do these look?
- Mmm.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.846
What is that supposed to be?

00:14.881 --> 00:16.610
Potato latkes swimming in oil.

00:16.649 --> 00:19.777
Apparently, Grandpa wants me to be
a house by New Year's.

00:19.819 --> 00:24.381
<i>What's that smell, papi?
Oh, that's even worse.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:27.159
Since when do you make potato latkes?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.093
Since I'm inviting someone
to join us tonight,

00:29.129 --> 00:30.596
and I think she'd appreciate it

00:30.630 --> 00:33.155
if we celebrated
Christmas and Hanukkah.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.598
- Someone?
- She?

00:34.634 --> 00:35.658
Hanukkah?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.260
Well, there may be a certain
Jewish lady

00:37.303 --> 00:38.634
I'd like to get to know better.

00:38.671 --> 00:39.831
What?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.465
Yeah, after
a long-distance relationship,

00:41.508 --> 00:43.305
it was nice to meet someone
in the neighborhood.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.743
She's excited to be having dinner
with a councilman.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.873
Oh, yeah, Archie's really busy, so...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.644
I just called him. He's coming.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.275
Oh! Great.

00:52.318 --> 00:53.478
- Yay!
- Yay.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.715
Now Archie and Matt
can finally get to know each other,

00:55.755 --> 00:57.882
and then we can double-date.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.551
Nope. No.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.685
I'm not going to do that thing
that I always do,

01:01.728 --> 01:04.355
which is get way ahead of myself
and start projecting into the future.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.524
Can you project into this afternoon
and have him bring drinks?

01:06.566 --> 01:10.502
Turns out, cooking Christmas
and Hanukkah dinner is quite a schlep.

01:10.537 --> 01:14.064
I'd help, but I have Model UN until 7:00.
I'm Sweden.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.507
<i>That's great, mi hijo.
Come home when you can.</i>

01:16.543 --> 01:18.170
See if you can get us
a discount on a Volvo.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.702
As Sweden, you get a lot of that.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.543
<i>Oh. Papi, don't worry,</i>

01:22.582 --> 01:24.914
I promise I will start helping you
as soon as I get home.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.078
- Me, too.
- No breakfast?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.418
No. Actually, I'm feeling kind of
queasy today.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.548
That's weird. Me, too.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.614
Really?
Yeah.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.819
I hope we're not coming down
with something.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.088
All right, I'm off to work!

01:35.128 --> 01:37.756
- Love you all! Have a good day!
Bye.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.222
- Bobby!
- Chipmunk.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.061
Hey.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.401
Hey, hon, you know you're gonna get
over your crush on me one day, right?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.372
You're so funny. Bye.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.466
See you, have a good day.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.635
Bobby.

01:50.677 --> 01:51.974
- What are you doing here?
- I came...

01:52.011 --> 01:56.107
No! I know exactly what you're
doing here, and I don't like it.

01:56.149 --> 01:59.209
What happened between us,
that cannot happen again, okay?

01:59.252 --> 02:00.947
I came to give
Justin a ride to school, okay?

02:00.987 --> 02:04.650
- He's got a bulky project.
- He does not have a bulky project.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.056
Thanks so much, Bobby.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.151
Who knew that "Nobel Prize Winners
and What They Wore"

02:08.193 --> 02:10.162
could be so heavy?

02:10.196 --> 02:11.493
Hey, Mr. Suarez.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.796
Hey, Bobby.
I was just about to put up the manger.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.935
Do you like our baby Jesus?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.838
We've had him since someone stole
our original 14 years ago.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.502
I had nothing to do with that. I swear.

02:23.543 --> 02:27.411
Can we go? Jimmy Carter's cardigan
just slipped off the hanger.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.471
Let me give you
a hand with that.

02:28.515 --> 02:29.573
Thank you.

02:29.616 --> 02:33.575
It's official. Jumpsuits are back! Again!

02:33.620 --> 02:36.919
<i>Thank or curse former Mode
evil queen, Wilhelmina Slater,</i>

02:37.257 --> 02:39.691
who started the trend after being
spotted about town

02:39.726 --> 02:41.591
in a one-size onesie.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.062
In other news, Connor Owens,

02:44.097 --> 02:47.123
<i>former Mode finance whiz
turned caged con man,</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:50.364
is behind bars for stealing
the Meade fortune.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.233
Officials are searching
for the missing monies.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.506
Let's hope enough of it turns up
to buy Willie a belt.

02:58.545 --> 03:02.743
After all, Ms. Slater, a waist
is a terrible thing to waste.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.816
What was she thinking?

03:06.853 --> 03:09.686
I've seen actual blueberries
look less round.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.781
I think it's quite flattering.

03:11.824 --> 03:15.590
Oh, Marc. She's gone.
You don't have to defend her anymore.

03:15.628 --> 03:16.788
Mom, leave him alone.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.888
He's just working through
a little Stockholm syndrome.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.561
She was the Symbionese Liberation
Army to my Patty Hearst.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.229
She even bought me a beret.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.169
Speaking of accessories,
the ascot's really working.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.301
- You think so?
- Trust me.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.275
Mom, we really need to move
on a new creative director.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.805
I don't like how
Hartley's dragging his heels

03:36.849 --> 03:38.476
on that list of candidates I gave him.

03:38.518 --> 03:43.148
He's considering a few other ideas
that are a little more outside the box.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.555
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't worry about it?

03:45.592 --> 03:48.288
My mom's letting her soulless
new boyfriend call the shots.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.592
That seems like good,
solid business sense to me.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.793
Look, Daniel. It's Cal's money
that's keeping this company alive.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.391
And if you will recall,

03:55.435 --> 03:58.996
our money is gone
because of your friend.

03:59.205 --> 04:03.938
God, I hope he rots in jail.
That traitor deserves whatever he gets.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074

04:30.770 --> 04:34.536
How on earth did you manage
to swing daily conjugal visits?

04:35.708 --> 04:38.973
Well, having a senator as a father
certainly has its perks.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.242
Willie, as fun as this is,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.215
we didn't have you turn me in
for nothing.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.581
<i>I know you want to be back at Mode.</i>

04:45.618 --> 04:47.848
So you do your part, I'll do mine,

04:47.887 --> 04:49.980
and we'll have you back there
in no time.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.423
Well, I hope it takes longer than that.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.916
These past three weeks
have been heaven.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.987
Aside from my tailoring bill.

04:58.031 --> 05:01.023
You've got to stop literally
ripping my clothes off.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.932
I can't afford to be caught
sneaking out again

05:02.969 --> 05:05.665
in one of your ridiculous jumpsuits.

05:05.938 --> 05:09.101
It's a miracle I could pass it off
as a trend.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.406
You know,
some idiots will wear anything.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.483
How long do we have to keep
hiding from her?

05:19.519 --> 05:22.181
Well, until we're less obviously happy.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.452
- Hmm. That could take a while.
- I know. I love our new thing.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.221
No labels, no expectations.
Just living in the moment.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.388
Oh! By the way,
will you bring drinks to dinner tonight?

05:30.430 --> 05:33.524
Something fancy? My dad's trying
to impress a new lady friend.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.591
Some guys never stop trying too hard.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.500
You want to see me break dance?

05:37.537 --> 05:40.472
Not now. But no expectations.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.977
What are you thinking about?
You're glowing.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.111
Nothing. I guess you make me glow.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.390
Mrs. Meade!

06:01.194 --> 06:04.527
You'll be landing at the Sioux Falls
Regional Airport at 2:35.

06:04.564 --> 06:05.690
I'm sorry I didn't book it sooner,

06:05.732 --> 06:07.324
but those dopes
at the international terminal

06:07.367 --> 06:10.461
kept telling me I was calling
the wrong place.

06:11.871 --> 06:17.002
Amanda. Am I doing the right thing
chasing after my lost son?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.603
I mean, what if he has a terrible life
because I gave him up?

06:19.645 --> 06:21.738
What if he doesn't want to know me?
What if he hates me?

06:21.781 --> 06:26.047
Mrs. Meade, you're putting way
too much pressure on my hand.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.747
Look, you just have to
show up and see him.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.222
And you'll know what to do next.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.553
Thank you, Amanda.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.857
But not looking like that.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.729
You're going to South Dakota.
You have to blend in.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.462
Less "money" and more "food stamp. "

06:42.502 --> 06:45.369
Come on. We're gonna give you
a "makeunder. "

06:45.405 --> 06:46.702
I've got the Silver Fox...

06:51.077 --> 06:53.773
Oh, the decorations
are so beautiful.

06:53.813 --> 06:54.939
Yeah.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.278
Hey, you okay?

06:56.315 --> 06:59.648
Yeah, I don't know why I'm so
emotional these days.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.846
Hi, welcome to Macy's Believe station.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.721
For every letter mailed to Santa,
Macy's will donate a dollar,

07:04.757 --> 07:07.055
up to a million dollars,
to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.493
- That is so nice!
- That's great.

07:09.529 --> 07:13.295
Now, I'm gonna ask Santa
to make sure that, one day,

07:13.332 --> 07:15.630
every child is happy and healthy.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.193
Sure. And I always ask for world peace.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.164
And what did you ask Santa for?

07:22.208 --> 07:24.233
Well, I can't tell you. Then I won't get it.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.471
Your wife's very superstitious.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.775
- Oh, she's not...
- I'm not his wife.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.648
Wow, January Jones
for our March cover?

07:36.689 --> 07:39.715
<i>- That's exciting.
- Enough Sad Men.</i>

07:39.759 --> 07:40.953
Isn't she a little played out?

07:40.993 --> 07:43.223
- I love her.
- I love her, too.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.592
You know, Marc, it's okay.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.189
You can totally disagree with Daniel,

07:47.233 --> 07:50.532
and he doesn't hit you
or psychically shame you in any way.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.629
It's confusing.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.930
By the way, your tie is really wide.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.101
Yeah, it's an ascot.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.008
- We're playing.
Mmm.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.975
You realize that's
kind of my bagel you're eating?

08:03.015 --> 08:04.380
I'm sorry.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.784
I've been feeling sick all morning,
and now I'm starving.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.516
You can have it. I'll go get my own.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.456
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.493
Daniel, Marc, I would like you
to meet Denise Ludwig,

08:15.528 --> 08:17.325
our new creative director.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.423
Denise, this is Daniel Meade,
our editor in chief.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.127
Hey, it is great to meet you.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.568
Are you ready to kick
this thing in the ass?

08:24.604 --> 08:29.098
Yeah. Denise here was head
of development for White Line Pictures.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.041
<i>This little lady is gonna bring
Mode magazine</i>

08:31.077 --> 08:32.977
a touch of Tinseltown magic.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.775
And you sure as hell could use it.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.510
I'm here to commercialize
your message,

08:37.549 --> 08:39.279
just like I did for White Line.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.878
I was the one that took them
from yawn-fest indie darlings

08:41.921 --> 08:43.855
to back-to-back blockbuster tent poles.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.415
I get back-to-back tent poles
just thinking about it.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.218
I'm kidding, you can't sue me.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.526
Actually, you can try.
I'd like to see that.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.828
Cal, we need to talk for a minute.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.391
Why don't I show you the tanning bed?

08:56.435 --> 08:59.632
- Solid.
- Okay, what are you trying to pull?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.266
My mother and I submitted a list
of top candidates in the business.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.901
You hire someone
not even in the business,

09:04.944 --> 09:06.741
without discussing it with us?

09:06.779 --> 09:10.943
Well, I'll discuss it with your mom
when she gets into bed tonight.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.247
And with regard to your problems
with Denise,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.379
my money, my choice.

09:34.607 --> 09:35.733
Please.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.744
You shouldn't be standing
in your condition.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.772
Oh, um...

09:40.813 --> 09:42.371
No. I'm not...

09:42.415 --> 09:43.507
<i>No breakfast?
No.</i>

09:43.549 --> 09:44.777
<i>Actually, I'm feeling kind
of queasy today.</i>

09:44.817 --> 09:45.875
<i>You do know
you're eating my bagel?</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:49.046
<i>I've been feeling so sick
all day, and now I'm starving.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:50.646
<i>What are you thinking about?
You're glowing.</i>

09:50.690 --> 09:54.387
<i>No labels, no expectations.
Just living in the moment.</i>

09:54.827 --> 09:56.124
...pregnant.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.475
<i>Cleanup on aisle seven.</i>

10:20.519 --> 10:21.884
<i>Cleanup on aisle seven.</i>

10:22.188 --> 10:26.591
Excuse me.
Hi, can you tell me where the...

10:28.227 --> 10:31.094
Um, you know what? Never mind.
I probably don't need it.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.222
It's all in my head.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.993
How'd you know?

10:37.036 --> 10:38.094
Darling, I know that look.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.331
I didn't work 25 years

10:39.372 --> 10:41.567
at the Barnard Health Services
for nothing.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.201
Just make sure
that you wait the full three minutes

10:44.243 --> 10:46.507
for a plus or a minus sign.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.740
And the saltines and the ginger ale?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.908
Sodas and crackers,
aisle four and aisle five.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.315
Thank you.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.418
Hi. I need a Be Shure
and a non-see-through bag.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.122
I'm a little late.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.326
- Pay at the front.
- Thanks. Saltines and ginger ale?

11:07.366 --> 11:10.199
Crackers and sodas,
aisle five and aisle four.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.000
And honey, relax. Maybe you aren't.

11:13.039 --> 11:16.566
I don't think so.
This is the one test I never fail.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.048
Unbelievable.

12:06.092 --> 12:09.255
So, how do you want to take down
Ms. Cecil B. Female?

12:09.295 --> 12:12.958
Dig dirt? Blackmail? Twitter backlash?
How do you want to play this?

12:12.998 --> 12:15.296
You know what?
I don't want to play this. At all.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.996
Denise isn't the real problem,
Hartley is.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.130
Soon as the FBI finds out where
Connor hid the money,

12:20.172 --> 12:23.232
we'll buy him out, fire Denise,
no need for crazy schemes.

12:23.275 --> 12:27.177
It's like I'm in a new land
where the customs are so strange.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.739
She's here.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.744
Daniel. Marc.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.346
- Willie, I...
- I'm really not interested.

12:37.389 --> 12:40.449
- Okay.
- Daniel, admit it. You need me.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.654
You'll never get that money
from Connor unless I help you,

12:42.695 --> 12:47.257
and I won't help you unless
I'm reinstated in my old position first.

12:47.299 --> 12:50.791
Actually, Willie, I don't need you.
The FBI is locating the money for us.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.634
The FBI. Cute.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.600
And your replacement started today.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.506
All right, then. I want every stick out.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.607
Yes, ma'am.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.618
You'll be
better off without me.

13:06.652 --> 13:10.383
Clearly, I'm no longer
the trendsetting icon I used to be.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.590
Nice jumpsuits, ladies.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.519
Call me if you need me.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.102
My help has arrived!

13:32.144 --> 13:34.339
I'll be right down in a minute.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.846
I've got to get in there!
- Okay!

14:17.890 --> 14:20.688
Hold on just one second! Finishing up!

14:24.463 --> 14:26.988
Betty, seriously, come on already!

14:33.739 --> 14:35.070
Coming!

14:40.212 --> 14:42.180
- I gotta pee.
- Okay.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.512
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.490
Excuse me. I need a bandage.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.227
Okay, one second!

15:12.945 --> 15:15.846
- When did you get home?
- I've been here.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.107
- What?
- What?

15:21.353 --> 15:24.584
Why are you two still up here?
I need your help.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.614
And that pot of tzimmes
is not gonna make itself.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.820
<i>- Just a minute, papi. I've got to pee.
- I've got to pee, too.</i>

15:28.861 --> 15:29.885
You were just in here.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.054
Okay, okay.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.998
- No, I've gotta pee!
- Hilda! So do I!

15:35.034 --> 15:36.695
I am older!

15:37.236 --> 15:38.703
That hurt!

15:51.350 --> 15:55.116
Hilda, come on! Seriously!
How long does it take you to pee?

15:56.855 --> 15:59.483
Come on, seriously,
I've got to get in there!

15:59.525 --> 16:01.857
Okay. All right, all right.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.259
- Betty, I need to talk to you.
- Not now!

16:08.300 --> 16:09.562
Betty!

16:13.906 --> 16:15.373
Shoot.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.318
Betty, I need to talk to you.
It's important.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.055
Oh, my God.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.427
No, Betty, seriously, I gotta talk to you.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.726
Coming!

16:40.766 --> 16:42.097
Coming.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.633
Betty. Betty...

16:48.507 --> 16:50.873
- I'm pregnant.
- What? I'm pregnant!

16:50.909 --> 16:54.640
- What?
Girls! Downstairs right now!

16:59.685 --> 17:00.743
There you are.

17:00.786 --> 17:04.017
Can you get the brisket
out of the oven, please?

17:05.557 --> 17:08.151
So, you got burned?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.752
What? No, I didn't get...

17:11.430 --> 17:15.457
Oh! Yeah. I got burned.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.866
How? Weren't you being careful?

17:18.604 --> 17:22.300
Of course I was being careful.
Why, weren't you being careful?

17:22.340 --> 17:25.867
Well, yeah, well, not as careful
as I should have been. Ow!

17:26.912 --> 17:28.435
Burned twice?

17:28.480 --> 17:31.916
That's what happens
when you don't wear an oven mitt.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.221
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.122
This is the chair Willie got me

17:43.162 --> 17:46.256
when I told her the one I had
was comfortable.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.963
This mark here?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.195
I was injecting her
with Botox, and I missed

17:50.235 --> 17:52.032
and hit a vein in her forehead.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.199
She ripped the needle out of my hand,
threatened to plunge it into my eye,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.071
and said if it weren't
for my clogged pores,

17:57.109 --> 18:00.738
my tiny brain would have
seeped out long ago.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.117
Good riddance, huh?

18:08.153 --> 18:11.316
Yeah. Good riddance.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.076
Still waiting
on that order, Tyler.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.485
Coming up.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.023
All right.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.492
You're not from around here.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.897
What gave me away?

18:54.933 --> 18:57.561
- You have all your teeth.
- Ah. Yeah.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.930
What can I get you?

18:59.972 --> 19:04.739
Much as I'd love to say scotch rocks,
I'll just go with a cranberry and soda.

19:04.877 --> 19:09.337
Ah, you, too, huh? I used to pound
pretty hard in college myself.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.785
You went to college!
I mean, you just seem so young.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.618
Community college.
A couple classes, you know.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.489
Learned enough to realize
that a few more shots

19:20.526 --> 19:22.721
and it would all go south pretty fast.

19:22.761 --> 19:23.887
Hmm.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.329
It's genetic, I guess.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.796
That's what I hear.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.526
Can I get you some Beer Nuts?

19:31.637 --> 19:33.070
Oh, that'd be lovely.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.604
So, what do we do now?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.109
I don't know.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.204
You can cube cheese.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.239
I'll get that.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.079
- This is crazy!
- I don't believe it!

19:50.155 --> 19:51.713
- Are you gonna tell Archie?
- Are you gonna tell Matt?

19:51.757 --> 19:53.054
- I don't know!
- I don't know!

19:53.091 --> 19:57.027
Hilda, what am I going to do?
I can't have a baby!

19:57.062 --> 19:59.121
- I know!
- I mean, I've thought about it.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.964
You know, maybe. Someday.
But not now!

20:03.001 --> 20:08.029
<i>And my career, finally!
And papi, what are we gonna tell papi?</i>

20:08.073 --> 20:09.472
Nothing tonight, okay?

20:09.508 --> 20:12.272
We don't tell anybody anything tonight.
Let's just get through dinner.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.575
<i>- But what if...
- Papi is not gonna find out,</i>

20:14.613 --> 20:15.841
'cause we're not gonna
say anything, Betty.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.315
And we are the only ones who know.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.513
Hilda, Betty, this is Jean.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.683
She works at the drugstore.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.985
- Hi!
- Hi!

20:26.024 --> 20:27.218
Hi.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.368
What beautiful daughters you have.

20:37.402 --> 20:41.896
I'm surprised I've never seen either
of them in the neighborhood before.

20:42.341 --> 20:43.569
Are you well?

20:43.609 --> 20:46.043
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yes, thank you for asking.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.807
Are you positive?

20:51.683 --> 20:54.516
Okay. Where can I put my apple cake?

20:54.553 --> 20:55.577
I'll take it.

20:55.621 --> 20:56.918
I'll get that.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.293
Hey! We both brought booze.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.827
Oh!

21:05.364 --> 21:08.197
- Just call us your sugar daddies.
- Okay!

21:12.604 --> 21:14.799
<i>Phone call! A Mode magazine?</i>

21:14.840 --> 21:16.364
That's Daniel.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.835
- He can wait.
- No, go, go.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.744
You have to make him believe
I'm the only route to that money.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.714
Convince him you still love me,

21:23.749 --> 21:26.684
just like you convinced me
two minutes ago.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.348
Go!

21:35.260 --> 21:37.160
Daniel. How sweet of you to call.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.924
I don't believe it's gone,
you lying son of a...

21:38.964 --> 21:42.730
Oh, it's not gone.
Not that you're ever gonna see it again.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.831
That money is mine!

21:45.270 --> 21:47.295
You want to talk about mine and yours?

21:47.339 --> 21:49.034
Let's talk about Molly.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.804
She was mine
until you stole her from me.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.936
And in a way,
you stole Willie from me, too.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.948
Willie? Connor,
what the hell are you talking about?

21:56.982 --> 22:00.145
I loved her.
I wanted to give her everything.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.552
<i>She chose you
and your company over me.</i>

22:03.588 --> 22:06.318
You're never getting
that money back, Daniel.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.952
You've got enough from me already.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.096
You Marc St. James?

22:18.136 --> 22:22.368
Oh! There must be a mistake.
This is supposed to go to Ms. Slater's.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.932
She said she wanted you to have it.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.277
Anyway, my niece made it,

22:36.321 --> 22:39.381
and I thought it might be nice
to light alongside the tree.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.551
Absolutely. That is exactly the spirit

22:41.593 --> 22:45.927
in which I whipped up these
multicultural holiday cocktails.

22:47.299 --> 22:51.099
I present to you mulled kosher wine.

22:56.641 --> 22:57.972
This is terrible.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.840
Is it okay if we have beer?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.209
Yeah, that stuff is gross.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.806
Look, I got it.
Who wants a beer? Matt? Betty?

23:03.849 --> 23:04.873
- Sure.
- No, thank you.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.248
Oh, yeah, we got it. Come on.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.046
How could you turn down a beer?

23:11.089 --> 23:13.751
- I don't like beer.
- I don't care.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.555
Passing on a drink is a rookie mistake.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.358
It's the first thing that makes everyone
think you're pregnant.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.764
Well, I'm sorry.
I've never hidden a pregnancy before.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.665
Well, you need to get good at it.
And fast.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.829
If somebody offers you a drink,
you take it,

23:25.871 --> 23:28.738
you put your tongue in the top
and then you don't drink. Duh.

23:28.774 --> 23:31.265
Oh. Right, duh.
I don't know why I didn't know that.

23:31.309 --> 23:32.970
Girls! Where are you?

23:33.011 --> 23:35.138
Okay, here we are!

23:36.281 --> 23:38.613
Here you go! Yum, beer.

23:38.650 --> 23:39.844
But you don't like beer.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.250
Sure I do.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.950
Oh, God, here.
Let me help you with that.

23:50.729 --> 23:54.460
I told you to act like you wanted a drink,
not like you were drunk!

23:54.499 --> 23:56.831
Hilda, I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.195
<i>Papi's date is the woman
I bought my pregnancy test from.</i>

24:00.238 --> 24:02.968
Wait. She's who I bought
my pregnancy test from today.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.168
I could barely get home fast enough.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.200
What? You took your test today?
Upstairs?

24:06.244 --> 24:08.712
<i>Yeah, well, I tried, but papi knocked.
I had to stop halfway through.</i>

24:08.747 --> 24:11.272
Well, when you knocked, I had to stop.
I freaked out. I dropped my test.

24:11.316 --> 24:13.079
I dropped my test.
I had to sneak back in,

24:13.118 --> 24:15.450
- pick it up off the floor.
- Well, I picked mine up off the floor!

24:15.487 --> 24:16.818
Wait, did we check the same test?

24:16.855 --> 24:18.049
I don't know.
I threw mine in the garbage.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.250
I threw mine in the garbage!

24:20.625 --> 24:22.183
Here they come.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.258
- Where you going?
- Um, I'm cold.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.497
Yeah. Grabbing a sweater!

24:27.732 --> 24:29.256
Scotch and soda, whiskey neat,

24:29.301 --> 24:30.529
- Seven and Seven.
Thanks.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.594
Seems like a strange job
for you to take.

24:32.637 --> 24:36.698
- Temptation all around.
- Well, if they're paying, I'm working.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.835
You know, here,
the post office, wherever.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.705
My mom had to quit her job
a couple years ago, so...

24:42.747 --> 24:44.180
I'm sorry.

24:44.749 --> 24:47.582
- Is she all right?
- Yeah. She's a fighter.

24:48.787 --> 24:51.347
I'm sorry.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.387
You're supposed to be here
on vacation,

24:53.425 --> 24:55.359
not listening to my troubles.

24:55.393 --> 24:56.724
So, what have you seen so far?

24:56.761 --> 24:58.729
Nothing. I just got here.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.163
Well, we've got more
than Mount Rushmore.

25:01.199 --> 25:04.259
We've got the Badlands,
Crazy Horse Memorial,

25:04.302 --> 25:06.133
and a whole bunch of meth labs.

25:06.171 --> 25:10.073
That sounds great. No.
Not the meth labs.

25:11.309 --> 25:13.038
That was a joke.

25:13.512 --> 25:17.380
So, if you want, I can tell you
some cool places to check out.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.645
I would like that very much.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.814
Oh.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.057
Here you go.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.391
Thank you.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.126
You're very kind.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.169
- Negative! One is negative!
- Oh, thank God.

25:38.203 --> 25:42.299
And positive.
Oh, God, I hope it's not me.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.240
So you're saying you want it to be me?

25:44.276 --> 25:46.870
No, I just mean that it's gonna be
so much easier for you

25:46.912 --> 25:49.745
to tell Archie than for me to tell Matt.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.478
Not really.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.679
What do you mean?

25:55.654 --> 25:57.918
Hilda? What are you saying?

25:59.190 --> 26:02.182
Exactly what you're thinking.
Oh, my God!

26:02.227 --> 26:03.751
It's not Archie's?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.355
- Well...
- Well, whose would it be?

26:07.265 --> 26:09.665
Oh! Sorry, sorry, it wasn't...

26:10.835 --> 26:13.201
Oh, my God, are you pregnant?

26:17.609 --> 26:20.442
Pregnant? Like pregnant pregnant?

26:22.047 --> 26:24.174
I don't know. I'm not sure.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.280
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.182
I might not be.

26:32.223 --> 26:34.953
See, Hilda took a test and I took a test,
and it got mixed-up,

26:34.993 --> 26:36.517
and, well, we don't know
whose is whose.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.121
But one of us isn't pregnant.
One of us is, we just don't know which.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.358
Whoa.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.360
I didn't mean for this to happen.

26:43.401 --> 26:46.598
Things were so good,
are so good, between us,

26:46.638 --> 26:49.163
and this is not anything that either one
of us should be thinking about.

26:49.207 --> 26:51.732
- Trust me, I know that.
- I hope it's us.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.267
- What?
- I kind of want it to be us.

26:55.046 --> 26:59.176
I know. I know it isn't something
that we planned, and it's probably...

26:59.217 --> 27:04.678
Okay, okay, definitely, definitely is not
the exact right time, but a baby.

27:05.423 --> 27:08.085
With you? How could that be bad?

27:08.326 --> 27:12.558
- Because. Just because...
- Betty, listen.

27:12.597 --> 27:16.431
Look, I'm the guy who can never pick
the right thing for my life.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.528
Well, maybe the right thing
finally picked me.

27:19.571 --> 27:20.663
- Look, Betty. Betty.
- Uh...

27:20.705 --> 27:22.297
Whatever problems we have,
we can work it out.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.639
No, Matt. I don't want to work it out!
I don't want to have a baby right now!

27:25.677 --> 27:29.545
I mean, I can't have a baby at all!
I can't be pregnant right now.

27:29.581 --> 27:33.677
Okay, okay. Well, maybe you're not.
I'll go pick us up another test.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.346
How? Hilda and I have stalled dinner
a hundred times,

27:36.388 --> 27:38.185
there's no way my dad
is letting you out of the house.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.384
Don't worry. I'll be subtle.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.317
Finally! Come, sit.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.329
You've been gone so long,
your beer's warm.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.694
I'll get more!

27:46.731 --> 27:48.494
Yeah, we sure could use them.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.433
Hilda, I think that's mine.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.197
- Is it?
- Yeah, I'm sitting right here.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.704
Who else's would it be?

27:53.738 --> 27:55.706
Hey, anybody want a baby?

27:56.675 --> 28:00.372
I got this for you.
It's not because I stole the last one.

28:00.412 --> 28:03.575
- Okay, I stole the last one.
- All right.

28:04.115 --> 28:07.573
That was very thoughtful.
Jean, Archie, this is Bobby.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.314
- Hey, Bobby, how are you?
- Hey.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.219
- How you doing?
- Good.

28:12.657 --> 28:14.022
Bobby?

28:17.028 --> 28:21.522
It's Bobby! Bobby in the house! Hey!

28:22.167 --> 28:24.260
Yay! Happy Christmas!

28:24.369 --> 28:26.428
Chipmunk,
she's still got a crush on me.

28:26.471 --> 28:28.598
It's so cute. It's okay.

28:29.207 --> 28:32.005
Damn it, Marc.
I just got off the phone with the FBI.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.943
They really think the money is gone.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.468
But Connor admitted
he knows where it is.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.105
He just won't tell me where.

28:37.148 --> 28:39.878
This ascot is making my neck sweat.

28:40.351 --> 28:42.979
We're experimenting.
It's a process. Here.

28:44.355 --> 28:47.518
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.821
I mean, if I don't figure this out,

28:48.860 --> 28:50.384
I'm gonna lose my own magazine
to my mother,

28:50.428 --> 28:53.829
her stupid boyfriend,
and Malibu Barbie.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.856
Technically, the brunette was Skipper.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.299
Okay, Marc.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.534
Daniel, I think that it's time
to call Willie.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.169
No. No. Absolutely not.

29:06.845 --> 29:07.971
Besides, she broke Connor's heart.

29:08.012 --> 29:11.072
There's no way he's gonna
give her the money.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.882
I'm not so sure.

29:15.920 --> 29:20.186
You see, once you've known Willie,

29:21.493 --> 29:25.429
no matter how terrible she was to you,

29:26.197 --> 29:28.495
you never really get over her.

29:28.833 --> 29:32.826
She will make you do things
you swore you'd never do.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.306
I've done it. Connor will do it.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.371
And you'll do it, too.
And I'll tell you why.

29:46.351 --> 29:50.310
Because she's Willie.
And we're just men.

29:57.095 --> 30:00.292
Wow! It's like you never saw
a wing before.

30:00.331 --> 30:01.457
Well...

30:01.499 --> 30:04.696
Look, it was nice meeting you,
but I'm getting out of here.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.704
My shift is up, so...

30:06.738 --> 30:08.603
I should be going, too.

30:10.008 --> 30:13.444
Take care.
And give my best to your mother.

30:13.478 --> 30:17.505
- Sure.
- She's lucky to have you.

30:18.416 --> 30:19.576
Okay.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.231
Ready?

30:42.407 --> 30:44.170
It's beautiful!

30:44.209 --> 30:47.975
Okay, let's all go inside and warm up.
Come on.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.677
Bobby, you want to join us?

30:51.716 --> 30:54.685
Oh. No, I think he's got
other things he's got to do, right?

30:54.719 --> 30:56.812
No, not really. No, I... Yeah.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.755
All right, welcome.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.182
Oh, thank you.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.792
I think you're in my spot.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.924
I didn't know it was yours.

31:10.435 --> 31:11.459
Hey.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.301
- I thought you were bringing beer.
- They were out.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.241
Well, you know how it is
with the holidays and alcoholics.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.471
That's true.

31:20.511 --> 31:21.978
Well,
all that matters is we can

31:22.013 --> 31:24.243
finally sit down to a nice meal.

31:24.282 --> 31:27.115
Jean, please light the menorah.
Matt, let me help you with that coat.

31:27.151 --> 31:28.175
<i>Oh, no, papi!</i>

31:28.219 --> 31:29.243
I'm gonna say
the prayer in English

31:29.287 --> 31:31.380
- for everybody to understand.
No, I got it. I got it.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.446
All right.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.956
- Dear God.
... coat already!

31:38.630 --> 31:40.063
Dear God.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.379
Excuse me.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.113
It wasn't me. I swear.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.028
Oh! Thank God! Thank God!

32:23.174 --> 32:25.438
- Right?
- Yeah.

32:26.644 --> 32:29.875
I mean, I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was a little disappointed,

32:29.914 --> 32:32.439
but it's all for the best.
I was getting ahead of myself.

32:32.483 --> 32:35.111
- It's not the right time.
- Not at all.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.621
Oh, my God, I have to tell Hilda.

32:37.655 --> 32:38.952
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

32:38.990 --> 32:42.323
I mean, she's practically engaged
to Archie, right?

32:42.360 --> 32:44.260
Betty? What's going on?

32:44.295 --> 32:48.595
Whatever it is, I support you.
Look, I'm not mad.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.095
- All clear.
- Thank you, God.

32:52.136 --> 32:55.230
<i>I was going to kill myself. Sorry, mi hija.</i>

32:55.273 --> 32:57.833
<i>It's fine, papi. I'm relieved, too.</i>

32:57.942 --> 33:01.378
- Good.
- Me, too. She said it first.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.944
Look, let's just all go downstairs
and try to have a nice,

33:04.983 --> 33:07.474
- traditional Christmas Hanukkah.
Oh, um...

33:09.187 --> 33:11.519
<i>Papi, can you just wait before you...</i>

33:11.556 --> 33:13.148
False alarm!

33:13.658 --> 33:15.023
All right!

33:22.500 --> 33:24.661
Back soon. Sweater.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.932
But you're already wearing a sweater.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.029
No, no, no, no, no, come on.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.666
Let's all go in and start this dinner.
Please.

33:30.708 --> 33:33.541
Okay. Good. I'm starving.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.614
I've been there, pal.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.955
Mmm. Well, you'll never guess
what I'm getting you for Kwanzaa.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.923
Hold on. Call waiting.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.485
- Yello?
- Amanda, I did it.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.931
I saw him, I talked to him,
and now I'm done.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.058
So he knows who you are?

33:56.100 --> 33:59.160
No. And he's never going to.

34:06.944 --> 34:11.779
Holy smoke!
That lady just left me, like, two grand.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.943
Someone thinks you're cute.

34:28.699 --> 34:32.567
Here we go. Jean, I'm so sorry
about your menorah.

34:32.603 --> 34:33.728
Oh, it's fine.

34:33.771 --> 34:36.934
Between the Long Island nieces
and the Brooklyn nephews,

34:36.974 --> 34:39.943
<i>I have handmade menorahs
coming out of my tokhes.</i>

34:41.712 --> 34:43.145
It would have been nice
to light it, though.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.172
Well, we could improvise
with votive candles.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.377
No offense to the blessed saints,
but around here,

34:47.418 --> 34:49.681
<i>we've got those coming out
of our tokhes.</i>

34:53.391 --> 34:55.985
- Where are the candles?
- I'll go look.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.432
Here goes nothing.

35:10.575 --> 35:14.671
Daniel. Marc. What took you so long?

35:16.614 --> 35:17.808
Hilda.

35:22.253 --> 35:25.711
You know, I never got
into all the saint stuff, Betty.

35:26.257 --> 35:30.626
Well, it never made sense to me.
They all look so happy suffering.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.460
But now I get it.

35:37.768 --> 35:42.068
What I did with Bobby,
what I did to Archie,

35:44.442 --> 35:45.841
I'm a bad person.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.970
I want to suffer. I deserve it.

35:48.012 --> 35:51.812
I wish that someone
would peel my skin off,

35:51.849 --> 35:56.946
or drag me behind a bunch of horses,
or make me swallow coals, you know?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.717
Are you absolutely sure that it's not...

36:02.760 --> 36:05.854
Yeah. He's been really busy
with the campaign.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.497
These aren't about the baby,
by the way.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.930
I've been lighting them all week. I just...

36:14.972 --> 36:18.533
I needed some sign, you know,
about whether or not

36:18.576 --> 36:21.477
I should break up with such a good guy.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.640
Well, I got my sign.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.945
I don't belong with Archie.

36:29.320 --> 36:33.950
I just... I don't know if I'm gonna have
the guts to tell him.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.225
Hilda.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.934
Maybe you didn't make the best choice.

36:47.271 --> 36:51.435
But you are a really good person.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.869
And you don't deserve to suffer.

36:58.316 --> 36:59.613
Thanks.

37:00.251 --> 37:01.912
But you know you still
have to tell Archie

37:01.953 --> 37:03.443
that you don't want to be
with him, right?

37:03.487 --> 37:04.818
Really?

37:05.923 --> 37:08.323
Couldn't you just peel my skin off?

37:11.529 --> 37:13.053
Can I come in?

37:14.098 --> 37:16.362
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

37:26.811 --> 37:27.869
Hi.

37:29.347 --> 37:32.145
- What's with all the candles?
- It's nothing.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.110
It's not nothing, Hilda.

37:38.055 --> 37:41.024
Your father invited me here tonight,
not you.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.057
And every time I get near you,

37:43.094 --> 37:47.326
you make some excuse to run off
into the kitchen or rush upstairs.

37:48.466 --> 37:52.027
And today, when that woman
thought you were my wife,

37:52.069 --> 37:53.730
you looked like you'd seen a ghost.

37:53.771 --> 37:57.867
- I'm sorry, I...
- No, it's okay.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.642
I love you, Hilda,

38:07.051 --> 38:09.576
and I know you care for me,

38:09.620 --> 38:11.645
but there's someone out there

38:11.689 --> 38:15.056
who's gonna be thrilled to be
mistaken for my wife,

38:17.595 --> 38:20.155
and I deserve to find that person.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.595
And you deserve
to find that person, too.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.195
I hoped it could be me,

38:28.739 --> 38:34.336
but since it isn't,
it's time for me to say goodbye.

38:44.388 --> 38:45.946
Happy New Year.

39:08.946 --> 39:11.346
So, provided I can get
Connor to give me the money...

39:11.382 --> 39:14.840
<i>We buy out Hartley and reinstate you
at Mode with 50% ownership.</i>

39:14.885 --> 39:16.785
With equal veto power.

39:20.591 --> 39:22.024
- Yes.
- Yes.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.988
May I now kiss the bride?

39:25.963 --> 39:27.521
Not so fast.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.625
Can you really do this
without consulting your mother first?

39:30.668 --> 39:33.296
Please, focus on getting
that money back.

39:33.337 --> 39:38.969
Oh, I will. And I don't care if I have to go
to that filthy prison every day to do it.

39:47.618 --> 39:51.315
Babe, don't worry, all right?
I'm not gonna come around anymore.

39:51.355 --> 39:54.722
I know that it makes you nervous.
I don't like that.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.324
Well, maybe a little.

40:04.735 --> 40:05.929
Bobby.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.865
What?

40:16.247 --> 40:19.648
It's okay if you want
to drive Justin home now and then,

40:19.683 --> 40:22.345
from school,
you know, since it's so cold out.

40:22.953 --> 40:25.547
Good. And I like having dinner here.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.752
Holidays with my family,
they're always so full of drama.

40:31.695 --> 40:32.855
Yeah.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.061
That was a lovely dinner.
You have such a nice family.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.133
Thank you. We should do this again.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.664
Maybe Easter Passover?

40:45.209 --> 40:48.303
I'd like that. Just don't tell my mother.

40:48.813 --> 40:52.305
She'd kill me if she knew I was dating
someone who wasn't Jewish.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.896
I'm sorry I freaked out before.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.967
Everything you said was so sweet.

41:15.172 --> 41:20.041
I wasn't really in a place to hear it,
but I'm really glad you said it.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.535
I meant it.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.974
I know, I know, it's not the right time,

41:26.016 --> 41:28.678
but when we were waiting for the thing,

41:28.719 --> 41:33.315
it was like I could see our whole future
falling into place all around us.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.123
That's crazy, right?

41:37.661 --> 41:42.360
No, that's not crazy.
Sometimes I imagine that, too.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.162
What do you see?

41:48.439 --> 41:49.838
It's silly.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.739
And I'd much rather focus
on what I'm seeing right now.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.642
That sounds good, too.

41:57.047 --> 41:59.277
Merry Christmas Hanukkah.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.845
Merry Christmas Hanukkah.

42:03.305 --> 42:09.768
