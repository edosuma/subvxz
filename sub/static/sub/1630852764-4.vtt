00:35.785 --> 00:42.167


01:12.989 --> 01:17.160
That was not
an especially relaxing session, Trotter!

01:17.243 --> 01:19.871
Y'all will thank me later.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.706
-Will we though?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.626
-What in sam hill?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.385
Let me look into this.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.390
Helen, did you overdo?

01:41.017 --> 01:44.104
When did you two
become a pair of hovering Hannahs?

01:44.187 --> 01:47.649
I am simply
easing my way back to full speed.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.400
In fact, I need to go.

01:49.484 --> 01:53.905
I… I… I've gotta file paperwork
to find Isaac's birth parents,

01:53.988 --> 01:58.243
and I gotta review that redline
that Marybeth's lawyer sent over.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.327
Who's Marybeth?

01:59.410 --> 02:03.248
Our new Ry--
Agribusiness manager--

02:03.331 --> 02:05.083
Helen, come on--

02:05.166 --> 02:08.962
You know my mouth can go one way,
and my brain will go another.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.464
Throw salt over your left shoulder,
and we're good.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.590
Okay.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.717
Well, if I may,

02:14.801 --> 02:18.096
speaking of people
who show up like bad pennies,

02:18.179 --> 02:21.891
guess who was out front
with Kyle last night when I came home?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.814
Hush your mouth! Noreen?

02:27.897 --> 02:28.898
Yes.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.568
What did you say? What did you do?

02:31.651 --> 02:33.987
What any proper Southern lady would do.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.282
I wished her a good evening,
and then I went inside.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.410
Then I slammed my ear
up on that front door

02:40.493 --> 02:42.287
and listened like a bat
with a hearing aid!

02:42.370 --> 02:44.747
-That's my girl!
-What, is she here just to see Kyle?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.626
No, I'm still trying to figure that out,
but he's not talking to me.

02:48.710 --> 02:53.131
And I suppose there's a world in which
I should be glad he is talking to someone,

02:53.214 --> 02:56.301
but that is just not the world
we are standing in right now.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.468
No.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.597
Well, someone cast a spell
on the front porches of this town.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.890
Who came to see you?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.642
-Look at that smile.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.769
Jeremy.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.188
Ronnie.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.772
-What?
-Wha…

03:09.856 --> 03:10.690
I know.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.233
-It was hot.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.069
I mean, like… like,
"before he put a ring on it" hot.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.905
Wait, what does that mean?

03:16.988 --> 03:20.617
-It means they had the old spark, like--
-No, no, no. I know what that means!

03:20.700 --> 03:23.411
-Sorry.
-I was thinking of Jeremy.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.455
Even though Hot Lips over here wasn't.

03:25.538 --> 03:30.627
Wow! Rein in your high horse, please.
This has nothing to do with Jeremy.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.340
This was just
an interesting chemistry experiment.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.175
Yeah, you sure it wasn't a history lesson?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.259
-Maybe.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.177
All right.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.640
Well, we are the proud recipients
of some crazy parking restrictions.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.808
What? How crazy?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.519
One-hour parking out front
and on both side streets.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.437
Ridiculous.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.981
Yeah, most of our clients
come for two hours at a time.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.776
Who's gonna wanna walk
a half mile after a workout?

03:54.859 --> 03:59.322
But… weren't you told that we have
up to 21 days to come up with a plan?

03:59.405 --> 04:02.116
According to the charming
and forthcoming gentlemen out there,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.911
we'll have 21 days to <i>implement </i>a plan.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.955
I'll get to the bottom of this.

04:07.038 --> 04:07.956
Ah, mm.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.875
You are swimming upstream
with your hands full.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.920
-I will go by the zoning office today.
-If you're sure?

04:14.003 --> 04:16.923
-Yeah!
-All right. Well, I need to get going.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.759
CeCe is probably already waiting for me,

04:19.842 --> 04:22.887
having reorganized my files
and waxed the floors.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.098
-She's a real go-getter, huh?
-She is.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.058
She and Ty are well-matched.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.269
Have a lovely day, ladies.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.271
-Hey. Take it easy, you. All right?
-Yes.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.564
-I will. Oh, I can't…

04:35.858 --> 04:37.193
You can leave whenever.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.113
Why would I leave?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.324
Everyone leaves…

04:45.326 --> 04:46.160
eventually.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.038
Wanna talk about that?

04:49.122 --> 04:53.376
No. No, whatever I say
is gonna be wrong or stupid…

04:56.671 --> 04:57.672
or crazy.

04:57.755 --> 04:58.715
Kyle,

05:00.049 --> 05:01.968
I'm here to listen and to help,

05:02.802 --> 05:03.720
never to judge.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.811
The whole world
is at the courthouse today.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.565
All right. Four sets of copies
of the Verdelotti deposition.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.858
That's for you, the witness,

05:16.941 --> 05:19.068
the defense attorney,
and the transcriptionist.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.738
No grass growing under your feet, CeCe.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.906
I need to give more thought on how best

05:23.990 --> 05:27.618
to keep such a speedy
and fine assistant occupied.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.794
-Miss Helen?
-Yes, my dear.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.254
I didn't realize the time.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.424
I have to run my wild bunch
from camp to the community center.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.177
-I'm so sorry.
-No, no, not at all.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.970
Our arrangement is, like, totes flex.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.350
What? Did I not get that right?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.101
I appreciate the effort.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.480
Yeah, I appreciate you,
so when you have to leave, you leave.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.148
-I'll hold the line till you return.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.900
Want me to bring you lunch
when I come back?

05:58.983 --> 05:59.942
Um…

06:00.026 --> 06:03.154
-You know, that would be nice.
-Her lunch has arrived.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.572
Oh, hi!

06:04.655 --> 06:06.157
Hey!

06:06.240 --> 06:08.326
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were here today…

06:08.409 --> 06:11.704
CeCe. Yeah, no worries.
I'll grab something on my way back.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.790
All right. Thanks, CeCe.

06:13.873 --> 06:14.874
Mm-hmm.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.960
-Glad to see you got someone helping you.

06:18.044 --> 06:22.715
Well, I am blessed to have people
watching over me and cooking for me.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.966
Food as support.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.094
Well, does your support
come with extra bacon?

06:26.177 --> 06:27.303
Of course.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.890
Oh, you know me far too well.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.605
Right now, um…

06:39.565 --> 06:41.484
right now, all I can express is gratitude.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.153
Not even asking for that.

06:48.699 --> 06:52.120
Oh, should you need dinner,
you know where to find me.

07:01.712 --> 07:05.299
-Thanks for squeezing me in, Zoila.
-Oh, my pleasure, Maddie.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.761
I do not understand.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.055
Well, of course you don't, sugar.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.852
But fear not, I will be your plucky guide
through the labyrinth of city planning.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.936
Bless your heart.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.607
What?

07:23.359 --> 07:24.235
Zoila, what?

07:24.777 --> 07:26.446
Oh Lord have mercy.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.990
Zoila have mercy. Tell me.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.826
Parking restrictions are being posted
in front of the Corner Spa

07:31.909 --> 07:33.286
because you do not offer

07:33.369 --> 07:36.372
the legally required number
of parking spaces for your clients.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.501
Therefore, said clients
unduly burden city resources,

07:40.585 --> 07:43.463
such as unrestricted parking,
and therefore must,

07:43.546 --> 07:47.800
in accordance with
Town Ordinance 783.314, subsection A,

07:47.884 --> 07:53.014
contribute to the relief of said burden
by paying for parking.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.266
Why didn't the zoning commission
say something

07:55.349 --> 07:56.476
when they approved our plans?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.852
I do not know.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.606
Your plans did not come across my desk,
or I would have flagged that immediately.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.441
Well, what am I supposed to do?

08:03.524 --> 08:06.903
Besides having our clients running out
to feed the meters halfway through Zumba.

08:06.986 --> 08:11.782
I would recommend you purchase
a dedicated parking lot for your clients.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.618
'Cause there's
so many of those lying around.

08:15.578 --> 08:19.081
As a matter of fact, there's one
laying around right behind the spa.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.793
No, that's not a parking lot.
That's the old Wilkinson place.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.505
According to town records,
it's a commercial lot.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.261
Purchased from the Wilkinson estate
by Fast Molasses LLC.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.014
No development plans filed to date.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.558
When we bought Miss Frances's house,

08:37.642 --> 08:41.187
we had to jump through flaming hoops
to get our lot reclassified as commercial.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.148
Your boss acted like
we were trying to classify water as wine,

08:44.232 --> 08:47.443
and he swore that the entire block
would stay residential.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.654
So has something changed?

08:49.737 --> 08:51.322
Or were we getting played?

08:56.619 --> 08:57.828
Around the horn.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.165
-Great, Jackson.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.792
Feel the difference on the release?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.919
-I do. Thanks, Coach.
-Good job.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.463
Good day, guys! Thanks, Gabe.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.714
You got it, Coach.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.304
-Jackson's looking good.
-Yeah, the kid's stepping up.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.265
Wish we could've got him
further along by State.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.433
Hey, that was their win, not our loss.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.103
They were bigger and stronger
with a deeper bench,

09:22.186 --> 09:24.355
and they weren't missing
their star pitcher.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.692
Which is why I need you to do me a favor.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.696
Of course. I'm not sure I follow.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.910
Could you write me
a letter of recommendation?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.203
Job hunting?

09:40.037 --> 09:40.871
Harlan, why?

09:41.539 --> 09:42.373
Really?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.751
Really. Are you not happy?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.336
-Cal…
-Did I do something?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.921
The school board meeting tonight?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.549
I mean, a head's probably gonna roll
for the loss at State,

09:51.632 --> 09:54.343
and since I'm not a famous MLB player,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.679
chances are it's gonna be mine.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.432
It's not like
they can fire Jackson.

10:00.224 --> 10:04.604
Slow down. I… I mean,
the board meeting should be a conversation

10:04.687 --> 10:06.439
about how we grow next year.

10:06.522 --> 10:10.735
Budget allocations for new equipment,
uh, resodding the practice field.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.363
Man, we made it to State,
and we should be proud.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.907
Cal, you weren't hired to <i>get</i> to State.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.035
You were hired to <i>win </i>State.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.496
That's why you're being paid
twice what Coach Tugwell got paid.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.167
And ten years since the last championship
is why Tugwell's gone.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.599
Sorry I'm late.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.101
How'd the interview go?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.270
The chances of finding a roommate

10:46.354 --> 10:48.522
that doesn't look likely
to up and kill me?

10:49.023 --> 10:49.857
Slight.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.150
Can't be that bad.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.736
-Dude had a chicken.
-Fresh eggs don't sound bad to me.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.905
Okay. Well, the chicken
shares the dude's bed.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.075
I feel like I've met
half the candidates in Serenity,

10:59.158 --> 11:02.703
and from what I've seen,
I don't wanna meet the other half.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.122
Have you considered Airbnb?

11:06.415 --> 11:09.627
Plenty of folks slide through town
for the Low Country festivals,

11:09.710 --> 11:11.003
hiking the trails.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.005
Heck, just to get away
from their families.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.133
The visitors can't be any stranger
than the natives.

11:16.967 --> 11:20.179
I'll be right back.
I've gotta grab some… eggs.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.645
Hey, Erik.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.230
Noreen!

11:29.313 --> 11:32.274
Good to see your face.
Didn't realize you were in town.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.735
I just had some loose ends
I needed to tie up.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.196
Not sure that I'll be here all that long.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.490
Well, how you feeling?
Aren't you getting close?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.409
Three and a half weeks.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.705
Little sore from the long drive in
and lumpy motel bed,

11:45.788 --> 11:48.833
but that's nothing
your chicken pot pie can't soothe.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.418
-Could I get one to go?

11:50.501 --> 11:53.295
Of course. It's nice to have you back.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.466
Thanks, it's good to be home.
Well, back. You know what I mean.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.718
I do indeed.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.388
-You're not coming with me?
-Am I supposed to?

12:02.471 --> 12:03.973
You could play guitar.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.058
I'm kinda rusty.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.103
And it sounds like
everyone's got a lot to learn,

12:09.186 --> 12:11.313
so I'd hate to be in your teacher's way.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.149
Do you mind if I come another time?

12:13.774 --> 12:14.817
Suit yourself.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.027
You're the one missing out on all the fun!

12:21.782 --> 12:22.950
Oh my God!

12:23.701 --> 12:24.785
-Hey!
-Hi!

12:25.286 --> 12:29.165
I didn't mean to scare you,
but you sure do look cute scared.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.375
You just caught me by surprise. That's it.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.378
-Oh, being here or the kiss?
-Both.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.338
You're not gonna blame me
for that, are you?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.467
You've been impossible to pin down.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.344
Yeah, but you're the one
with the busy schedule.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.306
You know, I don't have a lot
going on right now,

12:45.389 --> 12:48.642
so it would seem weird for me
to be trailing around after you,

12:48.726 --> 12:50.603
begging for a spot on your calendar.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.938
This doesn't have to be work, Ty.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.401
We just have to decide
we wanna make time for each other and…

12:57.485 --> 12:58.611
…have a plan.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.618
Unless you've been avoiding me.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.535
Never.

13:07.161 --> 13:07.995
Good.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.957
Because what I need most
in my life right now is something

13:12.041 --> 13:13.667
that's not work.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.465
When's your next free evening?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.927
They are all free because you're busy.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.679
Bet I can peel off for an hour or so
after work.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.473
-Yeah?
-Meet you in the park?

13:27.556 --> 13:29.225
Okay, that sounds great.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.978
Now, do I have to clear that
with your secretary first, or…

13:33.646 --> 13:34.480
What?

13:49.745 --> 13:50.663
Let's sit here.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.705
-Yep.
-Okay.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.541
Psst. Hi, Coach!

13:54.583 --> 13:57.670
-Hey, don't poke the bears.
-Why not?

13:57.753 --> 14:00.422
Hey, superstar!
How much we pay you to lose State?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.383
-That's why not.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.641
Do I get to hold the other hand
since Carla's home with the baby?

14:12.393 --> 14:13.894
Neither of you, don't listen to 'em.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.981
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
there's so many of y'all here tonight.

14:17.064 --> 14:20.985
I know this is a matter that strikes deep
in the hearts of most folks in Serenity.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.654
Especially those of us
who grew up in a time

14:23.737 --> 14:27.408
when the whole state of South Carolina
looked to Serenity for baseball champions.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.370
Which is why we felt it was important
to have a timely meeting

14:31.453 --> 14:33.747
about the future of our beloved Bulldogs.

14:33.831 --> 14:37.209
Now, in light of Coach Maddox's failure
to accomplish the stated goal

14:37.293 --> 14:40.713
of winning a State Championship,
there is a motion before our committee--

14:40.796 --> 14:43.924
-Hold on a minute, Mr. Gregg--
-Coach Maddox, we have a process here.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.385
-Everyone will have their moment.
-We had our moment!

14:46.468 --> 14:49.346
And they blew it!
I mean, what are we paying this guy for?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.849
Sure as heck isn't
to come home empty-handed!

14:51.932 --> 14:53.559
Well, I'm sorry you're all disappointed,

14:53.642 --> 14:55.311
but this is my first year
with the Bulldogs.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.272
And the first year in over a decade
that we even made it to State.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.773
Next year is looking more promising.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.610
"Promising" doesn't get my nephew
to college.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.278
We were down our star player.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.323
Hell, if he had played Jackson Lewis more
during the season,

15:07.406 --> 15:08.741
Lewis could've pulled it out.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.619
Hey! Cal gives Jackson
just as much attention

15:11.702 --> 15:13.203
as he gives to every other player.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.873
And, of course,
his girlfriend's gotta defend him.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.708
People! Come on! Hey!

15:17.791 --> 15:20.920
Safe to say, we all seem
set on our opinions about the matter.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.714
So I'm calling the question,
and we're moving to the vote.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.051
All in favor of renewing
Coach Maddox's contract for this season?

15:33.641 --> 15:36.018
All in favor of dismissing Coach Maddox?

15:43.484 --> 15:44.902
Three and three.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.613
And the deciding vote?

15:55.079 --> 15:58.457
And then I realized
I logged all those billable hours

15:58.540 --> 15:59.541
to the wrong client.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.462
-But Miss Helen was so nice.
-Yeah, Aunt Helen's great.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.882
And so smart, you know? She cares.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.551
I mean, she convinced me
to do Mock Trial, and look…

16:11.762 --> 16:14.598
I just… I never saw my future like this.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.892
Like, anywhere beyond Serenity.

16:16.976 --> 16:17.810
Yeah.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.481
Meeting her might be the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.482
Gee, thanks.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.110
-Oh, you know what I mean.
-Yeah.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.696
Or maybe you don't,
since you've known your future

16:28.779 --> 16:31.740
since you were, like,
knee-high to a grasshopper.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.617
Yeah, yeah.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.286
I'm happy for you.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.082
I might even go to court with her
this summer.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.376
I mean, wouldn't that be amazing?

16:42.459 --> 16:43.377
Amazing.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.007
So, what do we do now?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.718
I have absolutely no idea.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.139
Do I need to explain myself?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.098
No, ma'am.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.809
Hand to God,
this is all for the greater good.

16:58.892 --> 16:59.810
Yes, ma'am.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.688
I think we are gonna have
a splendid season next year.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.440
As a fellow booster, Mary Vaughn,

17:04.523 --> 17:06.942
I just wanna thank you
for voting your heart.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.654
That heart doesn't beat
just for my Jackson but for every Bulldog.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.199
And now, with Coach Cal Maddox
properly focused

17:14.283 --> 17:16.535
on an unbiased training program,

17:16.618 --> 17:19.830
next year when we're at State,
it'll be my Jackson on the mound,

17:19.913 --> 17:21.415
leading us all to victory.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.001
-I always said he showed promise.
-Make it happen.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.427
That woman has been whipping up cream
since childhood.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.471
Do not mistake yourself for the cow.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.724
Pretty sure
that was a slaughterhouse.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.810
Hey, three members voted for you
because they like what you're doing.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.646
Don't lose sight of that
because Mary Vaughn used her vote to--

17:44.730 --> 17:45.689
To blackmail me?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.193
To treat me like some dumb jock
who washed out of the Majors,

17:49.276 --> 17:51.445
and now she's turned me
into her own personal bobblehead?

17:51.528 --> 17:54.948
"Yes, Mary Vaughn. Thank you for my job,
Mary Vaughn. Your son's a star--"

17:55.032 --> 17:57.451
Hey, hey. We'll figure this out.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.745
-I did right by this team.
-Yes.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.663
-Tell me the truth.
-I always do!

18:01.747 --> 18:05.042
I need that. I never got the truth
out of Victoria, not about anything.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.549
Hey.

18:16.136 --> 18:16.970
I'm sorry.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.653
Oh! CeCe, hi.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.823
Good morning.
Uh, Miss Decatur isn't in right now.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.534
I just had a little research question,
but I can wait.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.827
Maybe I can help.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.454
If it's just, like, research
and not actual legal advice.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.790
I need to know the owner
of a commercial property,

18:44.873 --> 18:46.792
but I only have a corporation name.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.379
Okay. Several databases could be helpful.
I'd be happy to try.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.924
All right. Well, if you sure there's not
something else you need to be tending to.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.302
Oh, the main reason I'm here
is to help Miss Helen with her workload,

18:57.386 --> 18:59.346
but I'm actually having a good time.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.019
So it's not coming up right away,

19:06.103 --> 19:07.312
but that could just mean

19:07.396 --> 19:09.565
it was incorporated
outside South Carolina.

19:10.774 --> 19:13.068
If you don't mind,
I'll do some more digging

19:13.152 --> 19:14.403
and let you know what I find.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.113
Well, that would be wonderful.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.199
Thank you very much, Miss Matney.
I look forward to hearing from you.

19:40.929 --> 19:41.805
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.185
How are you?

19:46.268 --> 19:47.311
I'm on the mend.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.273
-I didn't mean just the arm.
-Well, I'm on the mend.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.652
-How are you?
-Staying busy.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.197
Yeah, it seems like
everyone's staying busy this summer.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.449
Can I do something for you?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.785
-Parfaits.
-Parfaits.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.539
Um, I'm here picking up parfaits
for the café at the spa.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.457
Oh.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.168
I'm sure they're ready to go
in the kitchen.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.169
Ask Bailey.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.638
I should've texted after the hospital.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.433
I could have too.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.190
I just didn't know what to say.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.067
Me neither.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.027
Okay.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.452
Mississippi makes it nearly impossible

20:45.535 --> 20:47.287
to access the adoption records

20:47.371 --> 20:48.997
that could help us
find your birth parents.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.417
I could try to find another way in,
but I… I just…

20:52.501 --> 20:54.378
-But we're done!
-No, no.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.965
-We're in search of a new path.
-Yeah, but what if there isn't one?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.967
Your birth mother left you that Bible.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.261
She left you words to guide you.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.721
Yeah. Maybe it was a farewell gift.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.431
I think there's a message there.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.601
So let's explore that as our next step.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.520
I don't ask for a lot in life.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.398
-Why is this one thing out of reach?
-Hey, hey.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.527
We will keep the faith…

21:20.654 --> 21:23.365
and we will find light in the darkness.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.962
Promise you'll eat some of these
in the comfort of your own home.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.134
One fresh batch of bacon tomato jam,
coming right up.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.179
When I was a kid,
we'd eat 'em up like apples off a tree.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.057
That… that sounds delightful.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.811
You know what else sounds delightful?

21:54.229 --> 21:55.647
Another date with you.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.734
Okay, well, I mean, that does sound

21:59.985 --> 22:00.861
good.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.405
But?

22:06.033 --> 22:06.992
Um…

22:10.287 --> 22:13.373
Oh God,
it's just… it's all this paperwork.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.627
You know, I've got the deal with you,
the deal with Cal. I'm… I'm just…

22:18.128 --> 22:22.674
I'm distracted…
…and I need an evening or two.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.553
You know, just to sort things out a bit,
you know?

22:27.721 --> 22:30.432
I can wait on my paperwork
if it speeds our date up.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.438
You're so understanding.

22:39.107 --> 22:43.362
I'm going to give you a call later.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.363
Is that all right?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.990
-Course it is.
-Okay.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.327
I'll go make my deliveries
and wait to hear from you.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.287
Okay.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.666
Wait, come back here.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.258
-Take it easy.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.072
Okay, okay.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.291
-Mom?
-Yeah?

23:38.375 --> 23:40.377
Do you have something going
with the farmer?

23:41.378 --> 23:45.674
Uh… Well, I don't think I'm required
to explain myself to you, young lady.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.717
Are you going to explain yourself
to Daddy?

23:47.801 --> 23:50.846
-This is complicated, Annie.
-Is that the explanation or the excuse?

23:50.929 --> 23:52.681
Excuse me!

23:52.764 --> 23:53.640
Get in here.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.143
Daddy comes back,
and we are having a great time,

23:56.726 --> 23:59.896
but you're sneaking around
with your business partner.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.815
How is any of that right or fair?

24:01.898 --> 24:04.734
What… Fair? To whom?

24:04.818 --> 24:07.737
To me! Or Daddy. Or the farmer.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.699
-Come here, baby.
-No!

24:12.033 --> 24:12.868
Annie!

24:20.542 --> 24:23.044
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.504
Yeah, I'm fine!

24:24.588 --> 24:27.507
You don't look fine.
You look upset. Let me help.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.926
No. It's complicated.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.516
Now, good foot on the step.
Push up with the crutches.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.977
All right.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.105
-Maybe I should crawl.
-No, you're good. Next one.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.441
-You're amazing!
-Mom.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.358
What? Okay.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.194
Use your momentum. Find your rhythm.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.821
-Yes!
-I'm getting the hang of this.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.198
Yes, you are!

24:52.073 --> 24:53.658
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Whoa!

24:55.076 --> 24:57.621
Okay, that is not
our most graceful moment.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.498
Thank you for the safe landing.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.249
You're okay!

25:01.875 --> 25:02.918
Come on.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.377
-Kyle?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.131
-Honey?

25:08.215 --> 25:11.218
I can carry him into the house
or back to the car if we have to--

25:11.301 --> 25:12.469
I'm okay. I'm okay.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.681
I'm so sorry, Mom.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.937
For all the trouble
and embarrassing you and scaring you.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.190
Honey, we're okay. We are okay, all right?

25:25.273 --> 25:29.069
-We're getting through--
-No. No, Mom. No.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.990
Please talk to me, Kyle.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.494
Please just talk to me.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.162
I didn't know how.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.498
How what?

25:42.499 --> 25:46.545
To tell you how angry
and invisible and twisted I felt.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.090
After everything
you've done for me.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.509
No, honey.

25:55.136 --> 25:58.139
All I have done is adore you

25:59.683 --> 26:01.142
for the glorious…

26:02.686 --> 26:04.854
…and unique creation
that you are.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.985
It is my honor and my duty as your mother

26:10.068 --> 26:13.029
to keep you safe and strong

26:13.113 --> 26:14.614
and for you to know…

26:17.284 --> 26:18.743
how much you're loved.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.788
I do know.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.248
Yeah.

26:25.041 --> 26:26.418
Oh, come here, baby.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.048
I have got you, kiddo. Always.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.218
Always.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.266
Where do we stand?

26:41.891 --> 26:43.268
In a really good place.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.771
And as I look at the tests,
it doesn't appear the miscarriage

26:46.855 --> 26:49.983
was attributable
to any underlying maternal health concern.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.026
That's a relief.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.195
Miscarriages happen
more than anyone speaks about.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.572
And often for no reason

26:55.655 --> 26:58.408
other than pregnancy
is a complicated process.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.576
It's a miracle.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.121
What comes next?

27:03.204 --> 27:06.499
That's up to you.
And not a decision you need to make today.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.002
We can talk about it
whenever you're ready.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.003
That's just it.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.840
I'm ready.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.760
I still want a baby.

27:16.843 --> 27:20.096
To… to carry a baby.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.643
And if I can't,
we can talk about the alternatives later.

27:24.726 --> 27:28.563
Well, then your next step is to see
my friend in Charleston, Dr. Ringle.

27:29.105 --> 27:32.734
She'll do more extensive blood work
and then lay out all your options.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.819
Thanks so much, Howie.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.823
I assure you, as a doctor and as a friend,

27:38.907 --> 27:41.409
I will be here for anything you need.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.953
Given the friendships
I've been blessed with,

27:44.037 --> 27:46.581
I know, without a doubt,

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
that this baby…

27:48.750 --> 27:52.087
…and I will have some fine companions
on our journey.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.307
Thank you for meeting me here, Noreen.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.977
Maddie, I… I need you to know
that I didn't mean to make things awkward.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.104
I just kinda…

28:12.065 --> 28:13.650
You can't possibly know

28:14.776 --> 28:16.736
how hard it is for me to say thank you.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.240
But I honestly do appreciate
you showing up for my son

28:20.323 --> 28:21.700
when he needed someone.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.160
Someone

28:25.078 --> 28:26.079
that wasn't me.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.542
Well, he's such a special soul.
I mean, you must be so proud.

28:31.334 --> 28:34.587
I can't take any credit for that.
Arrived from heaven that way.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.383
You've raised
three beautiful children, Maddie.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.970
I came to love them, to feel blessed
that I was gonna get to be their…

28:46.391 --> 28:47.892
You know, when Kyle called me,

28:47.976 --> 28:51.521
I was just responding
out of friendship to him,

28:51.604 --> 28:53.648
not disrespect to you.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.816
Thank you.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.986
But these are my children,

28:58.945 --> 28:59.904
in my house,

29:00.405 --> 29:03.658
and you cannot show up
without calling first.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.578
I overstepped.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.996
I get that. I just…

29:10.623 --> 29:13.168
Our kids are still family.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.548
How are you and the baby doing?

29:20.091 --> 29:20.925
We're good.

29:26.222 --> 29:29.684
I'm sincerely so sorry
for all the hurt I've caused you.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.118
Good afternoon!

29:49.370 --> 29:50.872
If you're here for lunch,

29:50.955 --> 29:54.626
let me recommend the BLT with the FGT.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.377
Hmm.

29:56.461 --> 30:02.133
As hard as it is for me to pass up
both bacon and fried green tomatoes…

30:02.217 --> 30:03.885
-Wait for it.
-Mm-hmm.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.845
I managed to make my own lunch today!

30:05.929 --> 30:07.931
I don't know
whether to be impressed or hurt.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.140
Impressed, please.

30:10.892 --> 30:15.688
This is a small gift to you
for your recent kindness.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.234
It's a book of poetry
that my mother gifted me

30:19.317 --> 30:22.737
when my daddy passed.
Helped me through a lot of hard times.

30:23.446 --> 30:27.158
Gave me hope,
and, um, it helped me to heal.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.370
As you've done for me.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.749
Well, it isn't a task
to be a friend to you, Helen.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.170
But thank you very much.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.175
And here I was
hoping you'd come to see <i>me, </i>Helen.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.593
Isaac!

30:46.427 --> 30:49.138
I, um… I don't have any news,

30:49.222 --> 30:50.682
but I do have a thought.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.434
Would you be able
to join me tomorrow to discuss?

30:53.518 --> 30:56.020
Yeah. Yes, of course. Thank you.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.731
There are more roads than roadblocks.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.317
I'll call you.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.988
Have a lovely day, Erik.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.823
You've seen to that, Helen.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.543
Hey, those strawberries
need your attention more than I do.

31:20.044 --> 31:20.879
Okay.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.931
Postmates delivery.
One sibling, side of crutches.

31:32.015 --> 31:32.932
Welcome.

31:33.474 --> 31:34.851
Uh, shoes, please.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.855
I'm so glad you came.

31:38.938 --> 31:43.359
I told your mom I thought some basic yoga
might help you with pain management.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.780
-Just lean back.
-I'm good, Ty.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.240
-I'm just helping you--
-Gimme a--

31:49.324 --> 31:53.161
That is the calming, centered energy
we like to bring to yoga.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.831
Oh no, I'm just dropping him off.

31:56.915 --> 32:01.628
Ah, right. I'm also going to teach Kyle
about being mindful.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.837
You wanna know why?

32:02.921 --> 32:05.131
Because his mind is empty.

32:05.214 --> 32:08.217
Because stress and anxiety halt healing.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.471
Correct me if I'm wrong. You have
a passing acquaintance with that yourself.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.014
I suppose.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.600
Meditation helps. Join us.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.651
All right.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.111
Settle in, gentlemen,

32:27.195 --> 32:29.781
and you may face the front,

32:30.698 --> 32:33.660
or that will do just fine.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.538
Close your eyes,

32:37.622 --> 32:41.751
inhale a deep, cleansing breath
through the nostrils…

32:44.170 --> 32:46.089
…and exhale through the mouth.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.052
Bro, what'd you eat this morning?

32:51.552 --> 32:53.680
You think that stank is me?
Have you met your feet?

32:53.763 --> 32:56.015
Gentlemen, let's stay focused.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.434
We are now going to visualize.

32:59.268 --> 33:03.022
We're visualizing a calming thought.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.857
A peaceful place.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.235
-Come on, pay attention.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.613
I'm quite sure I don't wanna know
what you were visualizing,

33:10.697 --> 33:13.116
but maybe try visualizing something else.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.243
Calm.

33:16.953 --> 33:17.912
Peaceful.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.207
-Bro, come on! Cut it out.
-Focus!

33:21.290 --> 33:24.043
See, look, it's all him.
I'm totally into this, Trotter.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.132
Dude, only you could fall
off your own butt!

33:34.095 --> 33:34.929
Yeah.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.604
Hey there, Noreen.
Your order will be up in a minute.

33:44.147 --> 33:44.981
How are you?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.274
Tired.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.901
I think a brass band
moved into the room next door to me.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.737
You're at the motel? Not with, uh…

33:50.820 --> 33:53.364
-Not with Bill.
-Sorry.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.700
I toss and turn a lot
because of the baby anyway,

33:55.783 --> 33:57.452
so it's not all that much a problem.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.412
Here's a thought,
because, as I've been learning,

33:59.495 --> 34:01.789
this is what we do in Serenity.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.709
So I live across the street
from the library, on the corner there.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.711
The green house with the pretty garden?

34:06.794 --> 34:08.004
That's me!

34:08.087 --> 34:11.174
Uh, so my housemate
got a job in Tampa and left,

34:11.758 --> 34:14.010
so the other bedroom
is available for a bit.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.470
Uh, it's not much,

34:15.553 --> 34:18.681
but you could cook there
if you're tired of ordering from here.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.266
That's really sweet.

34:21.517 --> 34:24.729
I think sweetness might be the thing
I've missed most about Serenity.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.190
-Let me take a beat?
-Yeah, take your time.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.233
-Isaac? Here you go.
-Thank you.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.778
Offer stands.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.079
Pour it out!

34:43.790 --> 34:45.625
You know, I don't know
whether to drink this

34:45.708 --> 34:49.045
or just pour it over my head.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.297
Don't you dare waste
my good tequila like that.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.216
Come on. Back in, back in.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.594
-Pour it out!
-Pour it out. I'm… I'm with you.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.721
-What's going on, Dana Sue?
-Hmm.

34:58.805 --> 35:03.017
Feeling a little warm,
caught between those two men?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.269
Yeah, I was caught all right.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.438
By my daughter.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.439
Oh, yuck.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.358
Dare I ask, doing what?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.443
-Uh, kissing Jeremy.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.030
-You didn't want her to find out?
-No! I mean, not like that!

35:16.114 --> 35:19.784
You know, I'd like to actually know
where this is headed before I have to…

35:20.743 --> 35:22.328
What, explain myself?

35:22.411 --> 35:26.541
Well, speaking of kissing and explaining,
have you talked to Annie about Ronnie?

35:26.624 --> 35:29.460
No, because I haven't even talked
to Ronnie about Ronnie.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.798
And Annie, oh, she is just gunning
for us to get back together.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.967
And, you know what,
I will not stoke that fire.

35:36.050 --> 35:36.968
Hmm.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.095
Mmm.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.180
Mmm.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.059
I told you,
it was the good stuff!

35:45.768 --> 35:48.813
All right.
That margarita works better on the inside!

35:48.896 --> 35:50.273
All right. All right.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.441
And while we cool you down, wild thing,

35:52.525 --> 35:54.944
maybe Maddie can tell us
how her boys are doing.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.362
How your boys doing?

35:56.445 --> 36:00.199
-I think I made a breakthrough with Kyle.
-Hey, congratulations.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.202
The thing is,
I don't think I got there by myself.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.746
Ashley played a part in it, I think,

36:05.830 --> 36:08.749
and, um, so did Noreen,
if I'm being honest.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.293
-Hmm.
-Wow.

36:10.376 --> 36:15.047
Who were we talking to, Dana Sue,
about, uh, letting people help you?

36:15.131 --> 36:16.382
-Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

36:16.465 --> 36:19.677
Listen, I am very grateful
for everyone who helped.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.928
And I even told her so.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.388
-Oh?
-I did.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.557
Well, that must have been
a fascinating conversation.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.311
She happen to mention
what's up with her and Bill?

36:28.394 --> 36:30.771
No, and I didn't ask, thank you very much.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.315
Although Bill, he called me,

36:32.398 --> 36:34.817
and he told me,
"I'd like to chat with you for a moment."

36:34.901 --> 36:35.818
About her?

36:35.902 --> 36:38.738
No, no, no.
I cannot imagine that.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.866
-I'm just… I'm so happy to have Kyle back.
-Amen.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.619
And just when I get him back together,
Cal unravels.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.998
That school board meeting,
it just… it really rattled him.

36:49.081 --> 36:52.293
I heard that Mary Vaughn was
the tiebreaker in renewing his contract.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.544
-Yes.

36:53.628 --> 36:54.962
What does he owe her now?

36:55.046 --> 36:56.839
-Half his soul.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.633
-His right kidney!

36:58.716 --> 37:01.302
Oh, uh, and Jackson as a starter.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.846
-Well, I understand the unraveling.
-Yeah.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.766
I've seen him get mad, pop off
a little bit, 'cause we all do that,

37:06.849 --> 37:09.060
but I've just…
I've never seen him so undone.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.228
Were you worried?

37:10.311 --> 37:11.687
No, no, no. Not at all. I just…

37:11.771 --> 37:15.650
It was just a flash of a side of him
that I didn't know was there.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.069
-Well, keep an eye on that.
-I will.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.320
Trust me, I will.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.365
Well, next up is Miss Helen Decatur.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.867
-That's me.
-Lawyer. Businesswoman.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.495
-And a suspiciously quiet friend.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.122
Helen, what would you like
to tell the people?

37:30.206 --> 37:31.040
Well…

37:36.003 --> 37:37.380
…I want to have a baby.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.591
I am going to have a baby.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.385
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.804
The walk of faith is happening, y'all.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.098
We are so excited for you.

37:48.474 --> 37:51.602
And we are ready to help,
you know, whatever you need.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.021
Yeah. Yeah.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.275
Helen?

37:59.860 --> 38:02.613
It's just that moving forward

38:03.322 --> 38:07.451
and doing this on my own means that, um,

38:08.577 --> 38:12.540
I'm finally saying goodbye to Ryan,
for good.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.167
Yeah.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.586
Yeah.

38:17.670 --> 38:18.921
Yeah, yeah.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.174
-I am.
-Hmm.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.846
Congratulations.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.473
'Cause I'm having
normal conversations with Helen?

38:30.099 --> 38:31.726
-Yes.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.355
Feels less like, "Congratulations,"
and more like, "It's about time."

38:37.773 --> 38:40.443
Erik, this whole process
has been about time.

38:40.526 --> 38:43.404
But you've done some good work,
and you're moving forward.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.824
-That certainly deserves congratulations.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.953
I'm just not sure how to feel about

38:52.496 --> 38:53.581
feeling good.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.918
Because you're whole enough
to be vulnerable all over again?

38:58.502 --> 39:00.588
You know what we call
that feeling, my friend?

39:01.464 --> 39:02.631
Being alive.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.602
Please, Ty?

39:14.685 --> 39:16.979
It's super fun.
And my teacher said it's okay.

39:17.063 --> 39:17.938
All right.

39:18.564 --> 39:22.193
I can play the chords,
and you strum, okay?

39:22.693 --> 39:23.569
Let's try it out.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.280
We are rock stars!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.574
Wait, wait. Slow down, slow down. Um…

39:29.116 --> 39:30.201
Okay, let's try this.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.620
One, two, three.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.580
One, two, three.

39:34.663 --> 39:37.208
-One, two… One, two…

39:37.291 --> 39:38.125
Play it again?

39:39.627 --> 39:41.587
-Yeah, great job.
-I love this song so much!

39:41.670 --> 39:43.506
Think we can sing it
as good as Mommy?

39:44.340 --> 39:45.341
Two, three.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.176
One, two, three.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.177
Ready?

40:39.437 --> 40:42.189
-Yeah, good job!
-Beautiful.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.320
-It was great.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.662
Thank you for seeing me
outside the office.

40:57.204 --> 41:02.293
I confirmed the Wilkinson lot
has, in fact, been rezoned as commercial,

41:02.376 --> 41:04.503
right before y'all got your variance.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.755
Some might call that good timing.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.757
Or some might call it suspicious.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.843
What's suspicious is

41:10.926 --> 41:14.680
I'm having trouble finding
the corporate records for the purchaser.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.057
Now, I'll keep on that.

41:17.141 --> 41:21.103
Since you ladies need to buy this lot,
you need to know who you're dealing with.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.480
Thank you.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.148
Anytime, sugar!

41:24.231 --> 41:26.317
Now, I have to get back to the office.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.278
Are you sure I can't buy you
a cup of coffee or a muffin?

41:29.361 --> 41:31.780
If you're onto something unseemly here,

41:31.864 --> 41:35.951
it will not help
if your confidential source

41:36.035 --> 41:38.412
is found to be
uncharacteristically absent.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.290
I need to skedaddle.

41:41.373 --> 41:42.541
Thank you.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.182
Did I

41:58.891 --> 42:00.643
forget a big celebration?

42:00.726 --> 42:02.269
I'm embarrassed to admit

42:02.978 --> 42:06.315
that I had to ask around town
to find out your favorite cookie.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.527
I felt better
when I got six different answers.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.780
Well, yeah.
I mean, I try not to play favorites.

42:12.863 --> 42:16.534
Well, in honor of the many facets
of Maddie, I kitchen-sinked it.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.954
So, wait,
does that make it the many <i>faucets</i>?

42:20.037 --> 42:21.956
-Oh goodness!
-No?

42:22.456 --> 42:25.292
Anyway, don't worry.
They should be totally edible.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.919
Erik and Isaac did the actual baking.

42:27.002 --> 42:30.339
Mmm. It must be nice
to be a partner in a restaurant.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.800
Is that what this is all about?
Trying to show off a bit?

42:32.883 --> 42:33.884
Not quite.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.346
Maddie, you have a very full plate.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.892
And I don't wanna add to that.
I wanna do what I can to help you.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.645
The other night…

42:50.651 --> 42:51.527
I apologize

42:52.611 --> 42:55.990
from the bottom of my heart
and the bottom of this plate of cookies.

42:56.615 --> 42:59.076
And whatever the future's gonna bring,

43:00.744 --> 43:02.246
I'm just hoping we can do it together.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.252
Hm?

43:08.335 --> 43:10.462
Well, if we are gonna have
a future together,

43:10.546 --> 43:11.964
you do need to know one thing.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.883
I hate coconut.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.803
How does your mom not know that?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.266
-Hey, lovely.
-Hi!

43:22.850 --> 43:23.767
Um…

43:26.437 --> 43:27.438
Oh.

43:28.022 --> 43:31.525
I hoped I was misconstruing things,
but it seems I was right.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.027
I'm so sorry.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.654
It… it's just ever since Ronnie came back,

43:36.280 --> 43:38.616
th… things are just…

43:39.450 --> 43:40.326
I get it.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.287
God, you're such a good man.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.206
And you don't deserve…

43:49.168 --> 43:50.628
We still in business together?

43:50.711 --> 43:51.545
Of course.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.506
Thank you.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.646
If there's one thing I've learned
in my years of farming,

44:08.729 --> 44:12.483
it's that grass is always greener
where you water it.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.611
Choose your pasture, beautiful.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.782
I only hope I'm still here
if you choose mine.

44:33.837 --> 44:37.299
So my birth mother
highlighted some passages, and…

44:37.383 --> 44:40.094
Uh, well, my family
didn't really go to church,

44:40.177 --> 44:43.639
so I don't know what's important
or what it all might mean.

44:44.181 --> 44:47.142
-Let's take a look.
-Maybe there's some sort of pattern?

44:47.226 --> 44:49.937
We know this isn't necessarily
a trail of bread crumbs, but--

44:50.020 --> 44:53.107
Could just be passages she connected with.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.066
Oh!

44:54.900 --> 44:58.112
"Lo, children are an inheritance
from Jehovah,

44:58.195 --> 45:00.906
the fruit of the womb, a reward."

45:02.366 --> 45:05.202
She and I have many of the same favorites.

45:05.786 --> 45:06.620
Oh!

45:06.704 --> 45:09.373
"For thou hast possessed my reins."

45:09.456 --> 45:12.543
"Thou didst cover me in my mother's womb."

45:12.626 --> 45:17.297
"I will praise thee,
for I am fearfully, wonderfully made."

45:18.424 --> 45:21.760
Oh! Of course! John 8:32.

45:22.469 --> 45:26.557
"And ye shall know the truth,
and the truth shall set you free."

45:28.142 --> 45:30.686
Every citizen of Serenity
should know that one.

45:34.022 --> 45:34.940
Of course.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.776
Wait. Why, what is it?

45:39.361 --> 45:40.988
Another step towards our goal.

45:44.199 --> 45:45.826
I know where we need to go next.
