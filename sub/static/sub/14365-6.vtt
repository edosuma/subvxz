00:02.628 --> 00:03.795
<i>Prime!</i>

00:03.879 --> 00:06.814
<i>What in blazes are your people
doing out here?!</i>

00:06.955 --> 00:10.293
<i>We had an agreement!
No collateral damage!</i>

00:10.376 --> 00:15.965
I am sorry, agent Fowler, but all Autobots
are present and accounted for.

00:16.007 --> 00:19.385
<i>Then explain why I'm
receiving reports of two</i>

00:19.468 --> 00:23.197
<i>jumbo-size bots mixing it up
20 miles outside Omaha.</i>

00:23.239 --> 00:24.531
Decepticons?

00:24.573 --> 00:26.325
There has been plenty of
infighting lately.

00:26.408 --> 00:28.519
Megatron can't seem to keep his
ranks in line.

00:28.602 --> 00:31.689
<i>Well, I'm just arriving on the scene.
Have a look.</i>

00:34.591 --> 00:38.306
I don't know.
Paint job beside it can't be Skyquake.

00:38.316 --> 00:40.755
You and Optimus pounded
him into the ground.

00:40.797 --> 00:42.807
Before Starscream yanked
him back out

00:42.891 --> 00:45.193
as some kind of undead terrorcon.

00:45.235 --> 00:48.763
The question still stands ...
who's the dance partner?

00:52.892 --> 00:56.479
By the Allspark, 
it is one of ours.

00:56.562 --> 00:57.939
Wheeljack.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.024
Jackie's back!

01:00.607 --> 01:02.485
<i>I don't care if
Abraham Lincoln is back.</i>

01:02.610 --> 01:04.194
<i>We have to contain this situation</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:07.615
<i>before we all wind up on the
11:00 news!</i>

You got nowhere left to run, Con. 

02:09.121 --> 02:11.691
<i>This is special agent Fowler of ...</i>

02:11.733 --> 02:15.795
Whoa! Stand down, hot head.
I'm on your side.

02:24.637 --> 02:27.973
Had a feeling the gang might show.

02:44.739 --> 02:46.273
Jackie.

03:00.921 --> 03:03.092
That will do.

03:05.176 --> 03:08.220
Oh, not this again.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.812
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Wheeljack. 
- Jackie, no!

03:32.485 --> 03:34.845
Dreadwing rigged the place to blow.

03:35.128 --> 03:36.421
Dreadwing?

03:36.422 --> 03:38.123
Actually, that was
your handywork, sparky.

03:38.124 --> 03:41.143
It's called a gas station,
kind of like an Energon depot.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.921
Doesn't mix well with blaster fire.

03:44.004 --> 03:46.549
Huh.
Well, our Con's getting away.

03:46.632 --> 03:50.623
Wheeljack, there are other
considerations.

03:50.627 --> 03:55.933
While upon this world, you would
do well to follow my lead.

04:00.862 --> 04:03.689
Ow! Take it easy, Doc.
I need that arm.

04:03.873 --> 04:06.375
Hold still and maybe you'll keep it.

04:06.859 --> 04:09.220
Look, commander, apologies
for the fireworks.

04:09.312 --> 04:10.513
Won't happen again.

04:10.554 --> 04:14.049
But I tracked Dreadwing across
100 light-years of space.

04:14.049 --> 04:15.659
I thought you were roving the galaxy ...

04:15.784 --> 04:18.995
you know, looking for Autobot refugees.

04:19.038 --> 04:22.566
I was until I found one ...
a Wrecker.

04:22.608 --> 04:24.835
- Who?
- Seaspray.

04:25.176 --> 04:28.372
How is old barnacle butt?

04:28.413 --> 04:32.134
Not so good, Bulk.
Blown to bits, actually.

04:32.176 --> 04:34.886
What?
No!

04:37.389 --> 04:39.641
Dreadwing.

04:40.066 --> 04:43.269
My flier, the Jackhammer,
picked up Seaspray's signal

04:43.272 --> 04:47.007
a couple of light-years from Madeira.

04:47.390 --> 04:51.177
<i>We made contact and arranged
a rendezvous in the Andromeda system.</i>

04:51.180 --> 04:54.580
<i>But Dreadwing must have
intercepted the transmission,</i>

04:54.664 --> 04:56.749
<i>'cause he got to Seaspray first.</i>

05:03.630 --> 05:06.800
<i>Proximity bomb was supposed
to take us both out.</i>

05:06.884 --> 05:10.220
<i>Guess I should be glad that
Jackhammer can take a punch.</i>

05:13.515 --> 05:16.393
<i>I picked up Dreadwing's
ion trail and tracked it through</i>

05:16.434 --> 05:20.271
<i>a dozen solar systems before
catching up with him.</i>

05:35.411 --> 05:39.749
<i>And he led me right back to this marble.</i>

05:40.833 --> 05:44.420
- Some coincidence, huh?
- I know of this Dreadwing.

05:44.503 --> 05:49.307
He was captain of a seeker armada, 
and, as such, like his twin, Skyquake, 

05:49.320 --> 05:52.727
fiercely loyal to the decepticon cause.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.796
Dreadwing has no doubt traveled

05:54.799 --> 05:58.750
to Earth to pay allegiance
to his one true master.

05:58.863 --> 06:02.196
Hope he's enjoying the visit.
It's gonna be his last.

06:02.662 --> 06:06.224
Wheeljack, this planet is heavily inhabited.

06:06.307 --> 06:10.544
Any strike we make against the
Decepticons must be carefully

06:10.586 --> 06:15.582
measured as a team, lest we risk
endangering the human population.

06:15.624 --> 06:18.786
Are you suggesting
we sit back and do nothing?

06:18.828 --> 06:20.829
<i>You!
Loose cannon!</i>

06:20.913 --> 06:23.182
Your cowboy antics almost blew our cover.

06:23.223 --> 06:25.667
- Cover?
- We're robots in disguise, Jackie.

06:25.751 --> 06:28.545
You needed an earth-based
vehicle mode outside of here.

06:28.629 --> 06:31.731
That spaceship you shot down ...
not earth-based!

06:31.734 --> 06:34.968
I had to jump through some big hoops 
to get it hauled out of plain sight.

06:35.010 --> 06:38.480
You need to keep a tighter leash
on your people, Prime.

06:38.522 --> 06:42.433
A tighter leash?
Let me clarify, tiny.

06:42.517 --> 06:43.518
Jackie...

06:43.601 --> 06:47.647
I'm not one of Optimus Prime's people.

06:50.835 --> 06:54.487
I'll talk to him ...
with your permission.

06:54.528 --> 06:56.781
Of course.

06:56.822 --> 07:00.259
So, the new guy has a little
problem with authority.

07:00.342 --> 07:02.119
Wheeljack and Bulkhead served

07:02.122 --> 07:05.456
together in the Wreckers,
a combat unit that operated

07:05.497 --> 07:07.958
outside the normal chain of command.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.676
Hmm. Black ops.

07:10.259 --> 07:12.970
They accepted missions no one else would, 

07:12.973 --> 07:15.632
and many of them did not come back.

07:39.196 --> 07:43.901
Lord Megatron, I live to serve.

07:43.942 --> 07:45.769
Rise, Dreadwing.

07:45.852 --> 07:49.331
Loyalty such as yours is
a rare commodity.

07:49.373 --> 07:52.401
Mine runs deep and true, 

07:52.402 --> 07:55.704
yet it is not loyalty alone 
that brought me here.

07:56.045 --> 07:56.699
Oh?

07:56.713 --> 08:01.284
I seek confirmation of the demise of one
whom I considered a brother.

08:01.295 --> 08:03.528
How did you learn of his passing?

08:03.611 --> 08:06.214
My twin and I shared a split Spark.

08:06.227 --> 08:09.016
We're metal, but two halves
of the same life force.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.603
Even across the galaxy, I sensed
when he emerged from stasis

08:12.687 --> 08:17.691
on his planet and when his
Spark was no more.

08:20.903 --> 08:24.639
It is true. Skyquake perished 
at the hands of the Autobots, 

08:24.722 --> 08:28.410
though not, in fact, under my watch.

08:28.493 --> 08:30.486
Then by the pit, 

08:30.488 --> 08:36.668
every last Autobot on this
accursed world will pay.

08:46.107 --> 08:49.219
The Autobots will be punished
for their crime,

08:49.221 --> 08:53.404
and many others,
how and when I see fit.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.165
But master ...

08:54.179 --> 08:58.202
Conflicting agendas will only
result in chaos and failure.

08:58.285 --> 09:00.621
You would be wise to remember
that, Dreadwing.

09:00.663 --> 09:07.794
You are under my command now,
and as such, you must follow my lead.

09:14.184 --> 09:17.104
Jackie, look.
Even if it weren't for the humans, 

09:17.117 --> 09:19.897
we couldn't take on the
Cons right now. We're outnumbered.

09:20.172 --> 09:25.928
Roadbuster, Pyro, Impactor,
Rotorstorm, Seaspray ... all dust.

09:25.970 --> 09:27.198
That's what I'm talking about.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.592
Wreckers are Autobots.
There just aren't that many of us left.

09:30.675 --> 09:35.463
But if we get behind Optimus, we have
a chance to end this once and for all.

09:35.546 --> 09:37.760
Guys like Optimus ... 
they talk a good game, 

09:37.774 --> 09:40.710
but when you're in the scrap, 
they don't want to get their hands dirty.

09:40.711 --> 09:43.546
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't know Optimus like I do.

09:43.547 --> 09:46.990
Being a Wrecker meant everything
to me, but I left that behind.

09:46.994 --> 09:49.901
Because Prime was the real thing...
blah, blah, blah.

09:52.029 --> 09:54.990
<i>Wheeljack, I know you're out
there, listening.</i>

09:55.073 --> 09:56.825
<i>I have a proposition for you.</i>

09:56.908 --> 09:58.994
- Is that...?
- Dreadwing.

09:59.035 --> 10:02.998
<i>Meet me at these coordinates
if you have the Spark.</i>

10:03.039 --> 10:07.210
I'll see you there, Con, 
just to watch you fry.

10:07.293 --> 10:08.503
Jackie, it's a trap.

10:08.586 --> 10:12.924
I know, but when has that
ever stopped me?

10:13.007 --> 10:17.011
You coming with?

10:17.094 --> 10:18.896
At least let me call for backup.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.557
You know Wreckers don't call
for backup.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.476
They call for clean-up!

10:35.779 --> 10:37.739
I wasn't certain you'd come.

10:37.823 --> 10:41.201
I don't like unfinished business.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.661
That all you got?

11:38.506 --> 11:40.700
If you're thinking about flying
out of here...

11:40.741 --> 11:42.344
Think again.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.608
Bulkhead!

12:20.379 --> 12:23.223
Bulkhead's signal 
over 1,000 miles from here, 

12:23.224 --> 12:26.002
and I would have to imagine 
that Wheeljack is with him.

12:26.035 --> 12:30.681
- Have you attempted contact?
- No response.

12:45.487 --> 12:46.696
What took you so long, Bulk?

12:46.780 --> 12:53.661
Don't tell me your riding with
Prime has made you... soft.

12:56.455 --> 12:59.759
If you will not take orders
from me, that is one thing.

12:59.842 --> 13:03.087
But when you place one of my
Autobots in danger...

13:03.170 --> 13:06.382
With all due respect, sir,
Bulkhead knew the risks.

13:06.465 --> 13:07.675
Every Wrecker does.

13:07.716 --> 13:11.019
Now, I'm sure he's just
somewhere in this rubble.

13:11.103 --> 13:16.641
Optimus, Bulkhead's signal
has moved from your current position.

13:16.725 --> 13:18.894
You coming with?

13:30.280 --> 13:36.494
You and Bulkhead share quite a history,
and yet you prefer to work alone.

13:36.536 --> 13:38.412
The Wreckers scattered a long time ago, 

13:38.454 --> 13:42.666
and alone's usually a lot less complicated.

13:53.886 --> 13:56.346
We are close to population.
Remember...

13:56.430 --> 14:00.559
Blasters and fuel pumps don't mix.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.519
Our boy is just up ahead.

14:08.650 --> 14:11.110
Hey, guys.

14:13.404 --> 14:15.406
Scrap.

14:23.079 --> 14:26.174
You really got yourself in
a heap of scrap this time, partner. 

14:26.257 --> 14:29.627
Stay back, Jackie.

14:29.710 --> 14:30.853
Better get to work.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.132
Have you defused one of these before?

14:38.302 --> 14:44.975
Fail-safes, dummy leads, booby traps.
It's a work of art.

14:47.561 --> 14:49.646
<i>Dreadwing, where are you?</i>

14:49.729 --> 14:53.274
Merely pursuing my destiny, Lord Megatron.

14:53.316 --> 14:56.577
Did I not order you to stand down?

14:56.861 --> 15:00.348
<i>Forgive me, one true master,
but it is my hope that</i>

15:00.431 --> 15:04.068
<i>vanquishing Optimus Prime will
earn your respect.</i>

15:04.082 --> 15:07.656
Optimus is not so easily disposed of, 

15:07.658 --> 15:13.003
as I keep trying to explain to all of those 
who foolishly attempt it.

15:13.886 --> 15:17.631
Jackie, if you don't abort,
we're both gonna need clean-up.

15:17.714 --> 15:20.217
Trying to focus here, Bulk.

15:22.094 --> 15:24.638
Where's Optimus?

15:25.879 --> 15:27.300
Like I told you, 

15:27.324 --> 15:30.769
when the scrap hits the fan blades,
the generals are the first to bail.

15:30.810 --> 15:32.187
No, not Optimus.

15:32.470 --> 15:36.399
I assure you, master, in but
a few moments, Optimus and two

15:36.482 --> 15:39.369
others will be blown to atoms.

15:39.452 --> 15:40.570
<i>I will allow it, Dreadwing,</i>

15:40.653 --> 15:45.608
<i>in memory of your departed twin,
but only this once.</i>

15:45.992 --> 15:51.264
I will be quite surprised if we
ever set eyes upon Dreadwing again.

15:56.376 --> 15:58.086
Where is the Prime?

15:58.370 --> 16:02.257
<i>Dreadwing, if you are
anything like Skyquake, </i>

16:02.341 --> 16:05.010
<i>I know that you value loyalty and honor.</i>

16:05.151 --> 16:08.346
Is there a point to your bluster, Prime?

16:08.388 --> 16:12.175
Only that Megatron knows
nothing of those principles.

16:12.259 --> 16:16.029
He lives solely for destruction
and conquest,

16:16.113 --> 16:19.775
<i>but there is another path ...
deactivate the bomb.</i>

16:32.995 --> 16:34.496
Get out of here, already.

16:34.580 --> 16:37.791
I didn't leave you on Sandakan,
and I'm not leaving you here.

16:37.875 --> 16:41.128
Face it, there's only one bot
who can defuse this mess,

16:41.211 --> 16:42.379
and his name's Dreadwing.

16:42.421 --> 16:45.340
Blaster fire's getting
closer, as if the commander ...

16:45.423 --> 16:46.633
Oh!

16:51.971 --> 16:55.016
Sorry, Jackie.
It's 'cause I love you.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.489
I'm sorry, fishies.

17:53.530 --> 17:58.243
- Bulkhead, wait!
- Out of my way!

18:00.662 --> 18:03.331
Will you listen to me, Bulk?

18:07.836 --> 18:08.628
You were right.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.673
Dreadwing's the only one
who can defuse it.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.175
And Optimus knows it, too.

18:42.494 --> 18:48.959
Dreadwing, defuse the bomb
or fall victim to your own device.

18:51.503 --> 18:55.590
I will gladly sacrifice
myself to avenge my brother.

18:55.673 --> 19:01.053
Then we will, in turn, gladly
join the Allspark with our brother.

19:01.137 --> 19:04.599
And with you.
You'll never shake us.

19:19.947 --> 19:21.698
Very well.

19:36.921 --> 19:42.301
I had it narrowed down to the blue
or the yellow. Or the red.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.240
So, who do we call for clean-up?

20:09.452 --> 20:15.124
Optimus Prime still lives.
As do you, Dreadwing.

20:15.208 --> 20:21.088
And that is a victory however small,
as Skyquake so tragically discovered.

20:21.130 --> 20:26.594
Speak to me not of my twin,
Lord Megatron, for I am here

20:26.635 --> 20:31.473
on Earth to obey your will
and yours alone.

20:37.062 --> 20:38.772
Listen, commander, I ...

20:38.856 --> 20:41.775
just want to say it was an honor
watching you work.

20:41.858 --> 20:45.145
I, uh, think maybe I had the
wrong idea about you.

20:45.428 --> 20:48.323
And it would seem that you
place a greater value on

20:48.365 --> 20:51.659
community than you otherwise let on.

20:51.743 --> 20:54.913
Whoa, let's not jump the gun here.

20:54.913 --> 20:57.206
Come on, Jackie.
If you leave, you'll probably

20:57.332 --> 20:59.333
just wind up coming right back again.

20:59.533 --> 21:03.129
All that wasted fuel, and
Energon is in short supply.

21:05.798 --> 21:10.344
Then again, we do have limited space.

21:10.427 --> 21:13.263
Not sure if I'm ready to give up
my freedom just yet.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.475
Maybe I could do some exploring,
see if this rock suits me.

21:16.558 --> 21:18.435
No offense to the Jackhammer,

21:18.519 --> 21:22.522
but you need
an earth-based vehicle mode.
