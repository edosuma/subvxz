01:29.450 --> 01:30.650
thank you sergeant.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.550
hi,chief.

01:31.970 --> 01:35.360
so our victim's name is called Carl Nelson

01:35.400 --> 01:37.240
16 years old,high school junior.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.720
He's riding his bicycle to school

01:39.790 --> 01:40.750
when unknown sailing 

01:40.820 --> 01:43.400
shot him four times with an 0.90 metre weapon

01:43.480 --> 01:45.210
on a slow-moving car

01:45.290 --> 01:46.820
Where're the victim's parents?

01:46.890 --> 01:49.910
****

02:01.770 --> 02:04.250
can't find my purse,can't get my cellphone***

02:04.320 --> 02:05.360
you lost your purse?

02:05.430 --> 02:06.300
okay,i don't lose it.sergeant

02:06.400 --> 02:08.919
i just can't remember where i put it.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.370
******

02:26.920 --> 02:28.510
don't look like a game member

02:28.640 --> 02:32.960
no,***

03:26.120 --> 03:27.680
He shouldn't be on the street.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.960
Sir, we can go inside.

03:29.230 --> 03:30.870
Perhaps you can show me carl's room.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.040
There might be something in there.

03:32.150 --> 03:34.600
I'm not leaving carl on the street by himself like that.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.620
No! This is what happens

03:35.740 --> 03:37.070
from doing the right thing.

03:37.140 --> 03:38.150
Richard, you cannot think that.

03:38.230 --> 03:38.480
This! This!

03:38.550 --> 03:39.820
You stay here with your son.

03:39.910 --> 03:41.440
I'll show them through the house.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.590
I'll show you through the house.

03:47.710 --> 03:48.700
All right, then.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.870
If you're looking for drugs or weapons,

03:53.950 --> 03:54.860
you're wasting your time.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.970
Carl wasn't that kind of a boy.

03:56.050 --> 03:56.890
You were close to him?

03:56.990 --> 03:58.480
Yes. Yes, I was.

03:58.550 --> 03:59.930
I counseled his mother when she was dying

04:00.000 --> 04:02.690
of cancer last january,and carl would...

04:02.920 --> 04:04.710
stop by my classroom sometimes.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.200
You were one of his teachers then?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.830
No. He went to a public school,

04:07.910 --> 04:08.940
but he knew a lot of the kids at

04:09.020 --> 04:10.130
our lady queen of peace 

04:10.200 --> 04:12.220
because he's very involved in our church.

04:12.390 --> 04:14.080
Is this carl's girlfriend?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.690
Kendall price.

04:15.810 --> 04:16.589
More like buddies.

04:16.709 --> 04:17.890
She's in my civics class.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.720
So when carl's father said 

04:19.760 --> 04:21.790
this is what comes of doing the right thing,

04:21.870 --> 04:23.120
he was referring to 

04:23.180 --> 04:25.570
testimony carl was about to give in the case of...

04:25.650 --> 04:28.320
gerald curtis and his motion for a new trial.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.550
Yes, but I can't imagine

04:30.630 --> 04:32.650
that carl would've been killed over that.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.870
Really? Can you think of another reason

04:34.940 --> 04:35.950
someone would drive by his house 

04:36.030 --> 04:37.240
and shoot him to death?

04:37.540 --> 04:39.220
Do you know what carl had to say 

04:39.340 --> 04:40.290
that was important enough to 

04:40.400 --> 04:41.900
get mr. Curtis a new trial?

04:42.590 --> 04:44.450
I know he gave a taped deposition

04:44.530 --> 04:45.910
to defense attorneys.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.340
A couple of weeks ago.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.420
Carl, can you tell us about the events 

04:50.500 --> 04:53.890
you witnessed at the kwikmart on june 21, 2003?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.410
It was really hot,

04:55.520 --> 04:57.200
so I stopped to get a soda.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.660
And then this really tall guy came in,

05:00.740 --> 05:01.250
I mean, like,

05:01.360 --> 05:02.920
way over 6 feet easy.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.520
And he was wearing 

05:04.560 --> 05:06.680
a red bandanna on his face.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.780
Like a robber in an old western or something.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.060
At first, I didn't know what he was doing,

05:13.130 --> 05:15.350
but then he pulled a gun.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.660
And he shouted at us to all lie down

05:18.720 --> 05:20.360
and not look at him.

05:20.550 --> 05:21.460
And, uh...

05:21.770 --> 05:23.820
the husband and wife that 

05:23.930 --> 05:26.180
owned the store, koreans,

05:26.290 --> 05:28.080
they were behind the counter.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.710
And the robber guy yelled at them

05:30.790 --> 05:32.480
to open the register.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.830
But the husband wouldn'T.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.470
I mean, he started arguing with him,

05:36.540 --> 05:37.660
and then just, boom!

05:37.810 --> 05:39.270
The guy just shot him.

05:39.650 --> 05:41.290
You mind pausing the tape please?

05:41.330 --> 05:41.790
Yes, sir.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.070
Chief johnson.

05:44.150 --> 05:44.830
Mr. Garnett.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.860
Thanks for moving so quick.

05:45.940 --> 05:46.780
You know how glad  we are 

05:46.850 --> 05:48.230
to cooperate with the D.A.'S office.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.620
Right.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.320
This is gerald curtis.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.480
This is the man convicted of killing 

05:52.560 --> 05:53.670
the two owners of the kwikmart

05:53.740 --> 05:54.720
you just heard about.

05:54.950 --> 05:58.630
Now, listen to carl's description of the assailant.

05:59.930 --> 06:00.830
Yeah.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.200
Like I said, he was 

06:02.320 --> 06:03.700
way taller than me.

06:04.040 --> 06:08.260
I don't know, maybe 6'1", 6'2".

06:08.340 --> 06:10.240
And blonde hair.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.130
But not like light blonde,

06:12.210 --> 06:13.970
like in between,like darker.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.700
And, uh...it was pale.

06:17.050 --> 06:18.530
Not old, either.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.360
Like maybe 20.

06:20.470 --> 06:24.240
And when he was emptying the register

06:24.320 --> 06:25.740
and his bandana fell down,

06:25.820 --> 06:28.030
he had this, like, scar running right here.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.920
Why are you just coming forward now, carl?

06:32.610 --> 06:34.280
Father watson's class put up 

06:34.360 --> 06:36.910
all these fliers asking for witnesses.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.600
And I knew gerald curtis was about to die.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.840
So I decided,

06:41.980 --> 06:43.590
I had to do something.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.010
Buzz, thank you.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.690
Father watson,he's the priest that took us

06:49.770 --> 06:50.640
through carl's room.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.160
And gerald curtis said he was innocent all along?

06:53.240 --> 06:54.500
Yeah, but they all do that.

06:54.570 --> 06:55.600
Lawyers for the freedom initiative

06:55.680 --> 06:56.820
took him very seriously.

06:56.890 --> 06:58.380
Also, in complete frankness,

06:58.490 --> 06:59.940
gerald's first attorney was not so hot,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.300
so if we've got the wrong guy in line

07:01.410 --> 07:03.660
for lethal injection,I want to know about it chief johnson.

07:03.740 --> 07:06.820
Given curtis' record,it made sense he did those murders.

07:06.930 --> 07:08.610
Two people put him in the store

07:08.690 --> 07:09.640
at the time of the murders,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.590
and he never denied being there.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.490
Also, in fairness,until we heard the deposition,

07:14.560 --> 07:15.400
we weren't sure in which order

07:15.480 --> 07:16.420
the victims were shot.

07:16.490 --> 07:18.080
So his testimony is very good.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.360
And now he's dead.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.280
Which looks to me 

07:20.360 --> 07:21.900
like somebody didn't want him in court.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.530
And it also makes it a lot harder for you

07:23.600 --> 07:24.850
to get another conviction.

07:25.050 --> 07:27.470
And we all know how much you hate to lose,mr. Garnett.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.730
Well, it's gonna be hard to cross-examine

07:28.800 --> 07:30.060
a videotape on the stand.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.330
So who exactly knew that carl was 

07:31.410 --> 07:33.190
coming forward with this information?

07:33.270 --> 07:35.490
Me. Gerald curtis' new defense team.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.080
Carl, of course,his dad, father watson,

07:38.150 --> 07:40.120
his students, members of carl's church,

07:40.190 --> 07:42.080
and probably curtis himself.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.290
In other words, the entire state of california.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.770
Including our killer.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.560
Maybe carl didn't just describe the guy

07:47.640 --> 07:49.450
who killed the koreans at the kwikmart.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.500
His own murderer as well.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.140
Chief johnson.

07:56.700 --> 07:57.720
A moment.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.340
A little good news.

07:59.450 --> 08:01.620
I paid most of the ransom estelle wanted,

08:01.690 --> 08:03.750
and I have complete custody of my kids.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.690
Oh...that's wonderful.

08:05.890 --> 08:07.610
Oh, congratulations.

08:07.690 --> 08:08.830
Thank you.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.450
Thanks for your testimony.

08:10.530 --> 08:11.540
You stuck your neck out,

08:11.620 --> 08:13.440
and that really meant a lot.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.230
Oh, no problem.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.090
Chief?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.340
Dinner's here.

08:16.420 --> 08:17.600
Oh, coming.

08:18.970 --> 08:21.590
Uh, I'll think of a more appropriate way

08:21.670 --> 08:22.770
to thank you later.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.030
Don'T. Don'T.

08:24.110 --> 08:26.020
It's my good deed for the year.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.520
Oh, and there was something else I wanted,

08:28.610 --> 08:30.370
it was kind of important,what was it, um...

08:30.440 --> 08:31.830
can it wait?

08:31.900 --> 08:33.159
Sure, yeah.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.320
Yeah, I can't think of it anyway.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.190
Yeah, we'll talk later.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.070
Ok.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.940
2 weeks ago,this carl kid records his testimony.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.030
And then 3 days before he gets to court,

08:44.110 --> 08:46.240
where the deputy D.A.Can cross-examine him,

08:46.320 --> 08:47.870
someone blows the boy away.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.000
Doesn't that sound a little coincidental?

08:50.070 --> 08:52.020
I don't believe in coincidence.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.040
So let's take the systematic approach.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.060
Has anyone seen my purse?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.270
I looked in my office and my car,

08:58.350 --> 08:59.740
and where are my keys?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.680
Ok, good.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.850
Keys, lipstick.What else?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.880
Daniels and I could pull the booking photos

09:05.960 --> 09:07.170
of everyone with assault charges

09:07.250 --> 09:09.190
who match a description in carl's deposition.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.740
That would be white males,

09:10.820 --> 09:13.210
under 30, over 6 feet with a scar from

09:13.320 --> 09:14.690
the mouth to the chin.

09:14.770 --> 09:15.930
Ok, sounds good. 

09:16.010 --> 09:17.580
How far back do you want us to go?

09:17.680 --> 09:20.060
Uh, let's start a year before the kwikmart murders 

09:20.130 --> 09:21.660
and take it through to today,

09:21.750 --> 09:22.860
and then, lieutenant tao,

09:22.940 --> 09:25.080
if you could follow up on the casings and bullets

09:25.160 --> 09:26.300
that were in carl's body,

09:26.380 --> 09:27.450
see if we're lucky enough to have any of them

09:27.520 --> 09:29.620
match up with the gun that killed that korean couple.

09:29.660 --> 09:32.200
Because if we are,detective sanchez,

09:32.270 --> 09:34.330
I think someone else might have seen carl's killer.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.130
Who's that?

09:35.170 --> 09:37.000
Gerald curtis.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.650
He's visiting L.A. Right now

09:38.730 --> 09:40.520
to appear at his motion for a new trial

09:40.600 --> 09:42.840
which means that the contents of his cell 

09:42.920 --> 09:44.080
at folsom have been vaulted.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.490
We need a search warrant to go through them.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.860
See if you can manage that

09:47.970 --> 09:50.630
and have his things overnighted to us.Thank you.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.940
And then while we're waiting,

09:53.020 --> 09:54.790
let's put together a removal order

09:54.860 --> 09:56.540
and send it over to our new friends

09:56.600 --> 09:58.390
over at the da's office

09:58.470 --> 09:59.630
because tomorrow morning,

09:59.780 --> 10:01.900
gerald curtis is gonna have to tell us

10:01.970 --> 10:03.450
his side of the story.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.140
Listen, uh...

10:10.210 --> 10:11.770
do you think the two of you could look

10:11.850 --> 10:14.470
for my purse? It's big and it's black.

10:14.550 --> 10:15.350
Trust us, chief.

10:15.430 --> 10:16.570
We know what your purse looks like.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.630
Ok, thank you.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.920
It's got my license in it,and my credit cards,

10:20.030 --> 10:21.400
my ammunition clip,my phone.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.820
Brand new cell phone.

10:22.930 --> 10:24.380
It's got a ring.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.940
Um, have you tried calling it?

10:29.010 --> 10:29.900
Hundreds of times.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.960
It's just, please see if you can find it.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.010
I am losing my ability to function.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.020
Thank you, officer.

11:00.840 --> 11:01.940
Gerald curtis.

11:02.050 --> 11:03.370
I'm deputy chief johnson.

11:03.450 --> 11:04.520
I'm sorry to put you 

11:04.590 --> 11:05.700
through transport from county.

11:05.780 --> 11:06.830
That's no problem.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.780
I loved the trip.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.090
Did detective sanchez 

11:10.130 --> 11:11.840
reappraise you of your rights?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.490
Yeah. Yeah.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.770
And, uh...

11:15.270 --> 11:17.170
I'm not sure

11:17.240 --> 11:18.990
how much I can tell you without my lawyer.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.010
I'm not investigating the kwikmart murders.

11:21.090 --> 11:23.340
I'm looking into who killed carl nelson

11:23.420 --> 11:24.780
yesterday afternoon,

11:24.900 --> 11:26.030
and you're not a suspect in that crime,

11:26.110 --> 11:27.290
so you don't need a lawyer.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.490
And from those chains you're wearing,

11:29.570 --> 11:31.080
I'm guessing that you had a pretty good alibi.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.020
Yes, ma'am, I do.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.320
You know, more than that,

11:35.390 --> 11:38.990
I really needed him alive,

11:39.720 --> 11:40.750
but I'M...

11:41.350 --> 11:43.520
trying not to think about it so selfishly.

11:44.050 --> 11:45.460
All I keep thinking about 

11:45.570 --> 11:47.590
is how close I came to having a new trial,

11:47.700 --> 11:51.470
and now...I don't know.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.150
But on the other hand,

11:54.230 --> 11:55.620
you know,I only made it this far

11:55.700 --> 11:57.250
because the kid stood up for me.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.460
I guess I should do the same for him,

11:59.530 --> 12:02.680
but I'm not really sure what I can tell you.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.280
Well, did you ever meet him?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.690
Carl?

12:05.770 --> 12:08.890
No. No, I didn't even know his name

12:08.990 --> 12:11.340
until my lawyers told me about him a couple of days ago.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.910
You tell anyone in prison about carl?

12:12.980 --> 12:13.940
Any of your friends?

12:14.590 --> 12:16.470
I don't have any friends 

12:16.780 --> 12:18.340
in prison, ma'am.

12:18.420 --> 12:19.270
And no,

12:19.340 --> 12:20.600
I didn't tell anyone.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.160
You know, I mean,that was something

12:22.240 --> 12:23.610
that my lawyers and father watson

12:23.690 --> 12:24.990
warned me not to do.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.670
You were in touch with father watson personally?

12:27.740 --> 12:28.420
Yeah.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.190
Well, a little.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.770
Through the freedom initiative.

12:34.110 --> 12:35.220
I was, like,

12:35.770 --> 12:38.830
 a project for his class.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.000
You know,it was a good thing for me.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.640
It's a really good thing because

12:42.710 --> 12:44.530
carl came forward.

12:48.610 --> 12:49.660
And I mean,

12:49.960 --> 12:52.060
you know, I know that in some ways,

12:52.140 --> 12:56.300
I didn't deserve a second chance.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.250
Oh, excuse me.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.760
I keep thinking about myself.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.650
And I know that that's wrong.I'm sorry.

13:08.450 --> 13:11.380
You're disappointed.That's understandable.

13:12.470 --> 13:13.340
I am.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.290
I am, because...

13:17.130 --> 13:19.100
I'm different now.You know?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.850
I mean, I admit, I admit 

13:21.970 --> 13:24.430
I made a lot of mistakes when I was young.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.510
But the reward 

13:27.820 --> 13:30.560
for change isn't freedom,it's, uh...

13:31.580 --> 13:33.520
supposed to be spiritual.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.500
At least that's what my priests tell me.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.450
So maybe I've been wishing

13:38.530 --> 13:40.600
for the wrong thing anyway.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.820
Sorry, how else can I help?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.220
You said you were in the kwikmart

13:47.290 --> 13:49.300
during the killings,and I was wondering if 

13:49.530 --> 13:50.650
you might have remembered 

13:50.720 --> 13:52.490
anything about the gunman.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.830
You may have to revoke your right 

13:53.870 --> 13:55.490
to counsel to answer that question.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.770
Thank you.

13:58.650 --> 13:59.520
Oh...

14:00.190 --> 14:02.370
I have been waiting years

14:02.450 --> 14:04.570
for somebody to ask me that question.

14:04.650 --> 14:06.920
I can answer you without my lawyers.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.990
I'll just, I'll go ahead and just 

14:09.070 --> 14:11.010
tell you what I told them, ok?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.110
I appreciate that.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.250
I was...

14:15.400 --> 14:17.610
I was high on pcp at the time.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.550
I wasn't even sure what the guy was doing really

14:19.630 --> 14:20.790
probably because he had this, uh...

14:20.860 --> 14:23.760
handkerchief, you know,tied around his face.

14:23.860 --> 14:25.230
It looked like a joke,

14:25.300 --> 14:27.270
you know, but he had a gun,

14:27.350 --> 14:29.750
and he told everybody to put our heads down.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.980
I thought, you know,in case this isn't a dream,

14:32.060 --> 14:34.530
I better stare at the floor.

14:34.610 --> 14:36.370
Uh, what else.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.320
He was really tall.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.560
He had lighter hair than mine.I remember that.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.580
You have any idea

14:45.730 --> 14:47.020
why two of the witnesses 

14:47.650 --> 14:49.470
thought that you were the killer?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.680
I hadn't showered in a couple of days.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.230
And I was...

14:54.540 --> 14:56.060
out of my mind.

14:56.450 --> 14:58.950
Soon as the guy left,I ran up to the counter,

14:59.030 --> 15:00.820
and if people had looked up

15:00.890 --> 15:02.190
then, they would've seen me 

15:02.270 --> 15:04.600
taking all the beef jerky.

15:04.910 --> 15:08.220
It's so stupid,I stuffed it in my pants.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.350
I thought, you know,

15:10.750 --> 15:12.280
free stuff.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.190
And he's been paying for it ever since.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.430
Which made him ideal for me to introduce

15:16.500 --> 15:18.700
to my civics class,the freedom initiative.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.580
Chief.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.260
We got the report back on the casings.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.860
The gun that killed carl,

15:22.940 --> 15:25.220
completely different from the one used at kwikmart.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.360
Ok, so it won't be easy.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.760
Thank you,lieutenant tao.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.080
But you knew gerald before his arrest.

15:31.160 --> 15:31.880
No.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.210
But I was looking for someone just like him.

15:33.290 --> 15:33.980
Really, why?

15:34.050 --> 15:36.010
I want my students to see from personal experience

15:36.080 --> 15:37.800
that injustice can be found in 

15:37.870 --> 15:38.830
their very own neighborhood

15:38.900 --> 15:40.580
and maybe even at the kwikmart, and,

15:40.650 --> 15:43.050
that the consequences of that injustice

15:43.130 --> 15:44.840
could be life and death.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.140
Well, I'd say you made that 

15:46.220 --> 15:48.290
point very clear, father.This way.

15:49.000 --> 15:49.980
Have a seat.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.550
But carl wasn't one of your students, though.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.220
No. No, he wasn'T.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.730
So how did he become involved 

15:56.810 --> 15:58.460
in giving mr. Curtis a new trial?

15:58.530 --> 15:59.560
I called the freedom initiative

15:59.630 --> 16:00.700
to see what they were doing in our area,

16:00.780 --> 16:02.380
and they sent over copies of everything 

16:02.450 --> 16:03.980
they'd obtained from gerald's trial,

16:04.050 --> 16:05.120
and I noticed,

16:05.200 --> 16:07.380
from the timestamp of the kwikmart's register

16:07.460 --> 16:09.800
that about 15 people had come in and out of the store

16:09.920 --> 16:11.550
minutes maybe even seconds

16:11.630 --> 16:12.770
before the murders took place.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.910
But the lapd only interviewed 4 of those people.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.280
So we papered the neighborhood

16:16.360 --> 16:18.650
looking for a witness that the police might have missed.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.370
And the person who finally turned up

16:20.440 --> 16:22.000
just happened to be someone you knew.

16:22.580 --> 16:26.190
Didn't that strike you as...coincidental?

16:26.270 --> 16:28.310
Struck me as a miracle,ms. Johnson.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.610
You saw carl's testimony.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.970
Didn't you find it compelling?

16:33.190 --> 16:35.050
I found it convenient.

16:35.130 --> 16:36.190
Excuse me?

16:36.270 --> 16:38.230
Carl nelson,a young boy,

16:38.310 --> 16:40.210
who with whom you were extremely familiar,

16:40.280 --> 16:43.330
suddenly turns up with crucial,

16:43.410 --> 16:45.350
never before heard information

16:45.430 --> 16:48.390
about a murder involving a death row inmate 

16:48.470 --> 16:50.730
that you had made the personal cause of your class.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.780
Soon after the boy gives his video deposition,

16:53.860 --> 16:56.550
he is conveniently shot to death

16:56.630 --> 16:58.680
before the prosecution has a chance to question him.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.700
A young man performed an act

17:00.780 --> 17:03.850
or rare moral courage.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.640
He stood up for the most powerless 

17:05.710 --> 17:07.500
and needy in society.

17:07.579 --> 17:09.140
And he was senselessly murdered for it.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.790
I don't find it convenient, ms. Johnson,

17:10.869 --> 17:12.630
because it's also the story of christ.

17:12.710 --> 17:14.800
The foundation of my faith.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.130
Which is not to say that I am any 

17:18.240 --> 17:21.750
less than horrified by carl's death.

17:21.970 --> 17:25.440
But now it's a responsibility to make sure 

17:25.859 --> 17:28.440
that gerald curtis receives the benefit

17:28.470 --> 17:30.360
of carl's sacrifice, isn't it?

17:30.470 --> 17:33.900
That is not my job,father.No.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.750
My responsibility is to find and arrest

17:38.050 --> 17:40.190
the person who killed carl nelson.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.970
So, unless you can think of any other connection,

17:43.040 --> 17:46.190
between your work and carl's death.

17:47.040 --> 17:47.700
No.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.100
I wonder, ms. Johnson.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.550
Do you believe in god?

17:59.860 --> 18:01.970
Right now,I believe in god a whole lot more

18:02.010 --> 18:04.000
than I believe you,father.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.730
We looked at the register tape, too.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.270
Asked for witnesses on the news,

18:10.340 --> 18:11.740
only so many responded.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.870
And when it comes to this carl nelson kid,

18:13.950 --> 18:15.890
summers in L.A.,We got more stray

18:15.970 --> 18:16.960
bullets than rain.

18:17.070 --> 18:18.830
You're suggesting that 4 bullets strayed

18:18.900 --> 18:20.510
into carl nelson's chest?

18:20.590 --> 18:22.210
The wrong kid may have been hit. Yeah.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.150
His death could be completely random.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.450
What physical evidence 

18:25.520 --> 18:27.310
do you have suggesting otherwise?

18:27.390 --> 18:28.800
Well, you might try investigating.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.610
Look, we are not being defensive about it.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.010
It's possible, too,that detective ross

18:33.090 --> 18:34.940
did everything right in his investigation

18:35.010 --> 18:37.150
and the D.A. Convicted the wrong man.

18:37.230 --> 18:38.460
If you know what you want to do,

18:38.540 --> 18:39.560
we're here to help.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.410
If gerald curtis didn't kill that couple at the kwikmart,

18:42.530 --> 18:43.630
it's possible that someone

18:43.710 --> 18:46.220
passing themselves off as one of the witnesses did.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.010
Did anyone who testified 

18:48.090 --> 18:50.200
or that you interviewed,detective ross,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.450
match the description that carl gave of the killer?

18:52.520 --> 18:54.120
It's been awhile.I don't remember exactly,

18:54.200 --> 18:58.260
but, twenties, white, tall,male, blonde, a scar.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.120
Doesn't narrow downvery much, does it? 

19:00.240 --> 19:00.960
You think?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.240
So far, we found 323 men with priors

19:04.310 --> 19:05.300
who could be the assailant.

19:05.380 --> 19:06.370
We're still running more searches,

19:06.450 --> 19:08.660
but I've got their booking numbers,their photos, so...

19:08.770 --> 19:10.100
ok, detective ross,if you could look through

19:10.170 --> 19:12.190
those people with us.See if you recognize any--

19:12.300 --> 19:13.020
where is she?

19:14.060 --> 19:15.580
Mrs. Pope, who are you looking for?

19:15.660 --> 19:16.800
You know who.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.470
Where is she?

19:19.580 --> 19:21.790
Estelle.Hello.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.040
Can I help you?

19:25.050 --> 19:27.880
Ok, we have the contents of gerald curtis' cell.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.030
Excuse me.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.390
Estelle, why don't we go into my office.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.070
I don't need to go into your office.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.320
I just came by to say 

19:36.400 --> 19:39.530
that if you think that now that my husband is free,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.450
your gonna pick up your little affair with him

19:41.530 --> 19:42.640
where you left off,

19:42.700 --> 19:44.790
and take over as the mother of my children,

19:44.870 --> 19:46.850
you had better think again.

19:48.010 --> 19:50.240
I'll take care of this.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.810
Maybe we should continue this--

19:51.880 --> 19:53.820
get your hands off of me.

19:54.090 --> 19:57.220
And don't you ever even step into my house,

19:57.290 --> 19:58.460
I am warning you.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.680
Because if I find out 

19:59.760 --> 20:01.620
that you are sleeping with will again,

20:01.700 --> 20:03.510
I will reopen this custody issue,

20:03.610 --> 20:05.850
and I am not kidding.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.690
Sorry.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.550
Sorry.

20:23.650 --> 20:27.330
Sorry,about that, uh...little interruption.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.650
Detective sanchez,is that the...

20:29.730 --> 20:32.480
contents of mr. Curtis' cell?

20:33.050 --> 20:34.990
Uh, yes, ma'am.Straight from folsom.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.660
So if we could maybe get organized a little.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.490
Um, sergeant gabriel,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.110
and detective daniels,

20:41.220 --> 20:42.950
if you could pass the booking photos off to 

20:43.060 --> 20:45.130
detective ross,and he could look through them

20:45.220 --> 20:46.720
and see if there's anyone he recognizes,

20:46.830 --> 20:48.730
and then maybe lieutenant flynn--

20:48.810 --> 20:49.530
wait a minute.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.060
You mean,we're not gonna talk about

20:51.140 --> 20:52.130
what just happened?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.220
No, I don't,I don't think so. No.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.140
Chief, listen--

20:55.250 --> 20:56.210
if you could look through--

20:56.280 --> 20:57.120
chief, wait, one second.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.700
Did you go deaf all of a sudden?She said, no.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.620
So you want us to go through the boxes.

21:03.700 --> 21:04.510
Yes, and, um...

21:04.590 --> 21:05.770
chief pope.

21:06.420 --> 21:07.410
Chief pope.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.260
And if, um,someone could please

21:11.340 --> 21:13.250
set up some interviews,

21:13.320 --> 21:15.720
with the old witnesses from the kwikmart,

21:15.800 --> 21:16.990
to see if any of them...

21:18.170 --> 21:19.840
are tall and blonde.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.240
Excuse me,just one moment.

21:22.810 --> 21:23.760
Chief pope.

21:25.570 --> 21:26.710
I can take care of this.

21:26.790 --> 21:28.870
What have you been telling estelle?

21:28.940 --> 21:30.110
Why does she hate me so much?

21:30.180 --> 21:32.230
Estelle is angry about the terms of our divorce.

21:32.310 --> 21:34.250
She's guilty about having basically sold 

21:34.330 --> 21:35.930
our children because her husband to be

21:36.020 --> 21:37.770
doesn't want them.She's lashing out at me.

21:37.850 --> 21:39.190
At you? My god.

21:39.260 --> 21:40.480
I may have just lost the respect

21:40.550 --> 21:41.730
of everyone who works here.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.220
Look,before you were hired,

21:43.300 --> 21:44.230
I made a full disclosure to the chief

21:44.310 --> 21:45.910
about our previous relationship.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.400
What? You told the chief we had an affair?

21:49.770 --> 21:51.900
Oh...god...

21:53.130 --> 21:55.380
is that the thing you forgot to tell me last night?

21:55.470 --> 21:56.750
No, no, no.That was about,

21:57.150 --> 21:59.260
I don't know.I forget what I forgot to tell you,

21:59.330 --> 22:01.050
but look, it's not as important as this.

22:01.190 --> 22:02.760
I will manage the fallout from estelle.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.980
Give me a day,I'll take care of it.

22:04.060 --> 22:05.300
How am I supposed to go back in there

22:05.380 --> 22:06.290
and face my people?

22:06.370 --> 22:08.310
Chief, we found something you should see.

22:08.670 --> 22:09.660
Ok.

22:12.650 --> 22:13.810
Excuse me.

22:17.710 --> 22:20.450
These are gerald curtis'  pen pals.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.770
This is kendall price.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.500
Look familiar?

22:28.900 --> 22:32.030
The same kendall price from carl's bedroom.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.000
I think I'd like to see this girl in person.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.710
Kendall, deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.190
And this is sergeant gabriel.

22:44.910 --> 22:46.470
Now, I don't want to scare you,

22:46.580 --> 22:48.720
but everyone who comes into this room...

22:48.790 --> 22:50.580
I'll tell you why it matters.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.230
Because if pope pulled her into our department

22:53.300 --> 22:54.460
because she's his ex,

22:54.530 --> 22:55.850
I mean, come on,how does that sound?

22:55.920 --> 22:58.020
I don't give a flying you know what.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.240
It's nobody's business 

22:59.280 --> 23:01.110
what she did with pope then or now.

23:01.190 --> 23:03.330
I mean, even if she has fooled around with him,

23:03.400 --> 23:05.750
who does a better job around here, you?

23:07.070 --> 23:08.660
I don't want to hear another word about it.

23:08.740 --> 23:11.540
And neither does tao or buzz, do you guys?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.560
Ok, guys.

23:16.050 --> 23:17.830
But you guys don't think that taylor

23:17.910 --> 23:19.890
isn't gonna have a field day with this?

23:19.960 --> 23:21.250
I mean, it's bad.

23:25.350 --> 23:27.760
I mean, if she's banging the boss,I want to know.

23:27.830 --> 23:30.010
Well, now that we've got that out of the way,

23:30.080 --> 23:31.990
we can go on to more important matters.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.580
You were close to carl nelson.

23:34.650 --> 23:35.650
Is that right, kendall?

23:36.610 --> 23:37.900
I knew him.

23:37.980 --> 23:39.150
He went to our church,

23:39.260 --> 23:41.390
and I saw him a few times 

23:41.470 --> 23:44.220
after school in father watson's classroom.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.350
Well, I thought you were good friends, no?

23:47.420 --> 23:48.970
Not really.

23:49.090 --> 23:50.740
That surprises me.

23:50.850 --> 23:52.030
Because...

23:52.600 --> 23:55.340
this picture was the only one

23:55.420 --> 23:57.640
carl had in his room of anyone.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.180
And I know that his mother just passed away.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.670
I didn't give him this picture.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.180
I think it's off of his cell phone or something.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.070
Carl and his mom fought a lot.

24:10.150 --> 24:12.060
He said that she drank,

24:13.050 --> 24:14.350
and stuff like that.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.770
So he spoke with you about his home life?

24:16.850 --> 24:19.120
That sounds like you were pretty close to me.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.950
We just started spending 

24:22.030 --> 24:23.930
more time together.Recently.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.150
I mean,you know how it is.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.230
When you only really like someone,

24:29.310 --> 24:31.780
but they have a really big crush on you,

24:31.860 --> 24:33.730
and you don't want to hurt their feelings,

24:33.800 --> 24:36.230
but you know, you just want to be friends.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.210
I know exactly what that's like, yes.

24:39.290 --> 24:41.000
That was me and carl.

24:41.350 --> 24:43.580
Was that you and gerald curtis as well?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.810
Did he have a little crush on you?

24:45.130 --> 24:47.190
Do you know how he got this photo?

24:47.300 --> 24:49.090
Actually, did you know he had this photo?

24:49.930 --> 24:51.150
I sent it to him.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.750
You were in contact with gerald?

24:52.830 --> 24:55.090
We all wrote to gerry.Gerald.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.220
It was part of our class assignment.

24:57.390 --> 24:59.250
How often did you write to him?

25:00.010 --> 25:01.150
I don't know.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.530
Only a few times.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.310
We didn't find any of your letters

25:05.380 --> 25:07.020
in gerry's cell.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.400
Prison mail isn't private.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.150
They can read it if they want to.

25:10.230 --> 25:12.820
So gerry threw away all of his personal letters.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.310
So the letters that you wrote to gerry

25:14.390 --> 25:15.680
were personal?

25:15.760 --> 25:16.480
No.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.630
No, he 

25:17.740 --> 25:19.150
had a small cell,

25:19.210 --> 25:21.380
and he didn't have a lot of room to keep things,

25:21.480 --> 25:24.810
so you know,he threw away my letters.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.370
How do you know that?

25:27.440 --> 25:28.550
Did he write you back?

25:28.660 --> 25:31.110
Well...yes.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.420
How often?

25:32.540 --> 25:35.020
Only a few times.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.830
And it was not at all personal.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.660
Then why did you send him the photo?

25:40.780 --> 25:43.010
It's just a school photo.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.340
Is there anything wrong with that?

25:44.420 --> 25:47.200
Nothing. Nothing, kendall.Not one thing.

25:47.270 --> 25:49.010
Now do you mind if i look at the letters

25:49.070 --> 25:50.800
that gerry wrote you since they are

25:50.880 --> 25:52.320
not at all personal?

25:52.400 --> 25:53.260
I didn't save them.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.800
I, um...

25:57.520 --> 25:58.620
shredded them.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.590
And threw them away.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.540
You shredded them?

26:02.620 --> 26:03.510
Well, kendall,

26:03.750 --> 26:05.920
you certainly are careful with how you dispose  

26:05.960 --> 26:09.490
of your meaningless correspondence.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.190
So just right down this hall,to the left.

26:14.270 --> 26:14.630
Ok.

26:14.700 --> 26:15.850
Ok, thank you.

26:17.730 --> 26:19.460
So, now what?

26:19.540 --> 26:21.290
Let's get a search warrant for her house,

26:21.400 --> 26:23.270
and let's get there before she does.

26:28.070 --> 26:29.020
Hi.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.030
I still can't find my purse.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.450
I think I should cancel my credit cards.

26:35.530 --> 26:37.020
What do you think?

26:38.150 --> 26:40.310
Did you have a bad day?What is it?

26:41.350 --> 26:42.680
Yeah, I had a bad day.

26:43.370 --> 26:44.280
Did you?

26:46.930 --> 26:49.320
I think I need a glass of merlot.

26:51.930 --> 26:53.850
Yeah, well,I'm not surprised.

26:54.150 --> 26:55.970
That must've been a big shock.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.800
Having estelle pope 

26:58.400 --> 27:00.600
burst in on you like that.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.190
Dredging up the past.Making all those...

27:03.270 --> 27:05.300
wild accusations.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.240
Oh, I know that look.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.880
You're trying to figure out how angry I am.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.420
So you can decide how much 

27:11.500 --> 27:12.750
you ought to explain.

27:12.830 --> 27:13.550
Look...

27:14.090 --> 27:15.520
I don't know what you heard.

27:15.670 --> 27:17.600
But I don't like what happened today either.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.030
How do you know about all this anyway?

27:20.130 --> 27:21.050
That's not important.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.100
What's important 

27:22.170 --> 27:23.130
is that estelle accused you of 

27:23.240 --> 27:24.600
wanting to get back together with pope.

27:24.630 --> 27:25.660
And she wouldn't have done that

27:25.730 --> 27:26.650
if she didn't think it was true.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.060
And why does she think that?

27:28.100 --> 27:30.010
I don't know.Because it'S...

27:30.120 --> 27:32.870
it's not true.It is not what I want.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.030
It doesn't matter what you want, brenda.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.130
I know what you want.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.910
Just like estelle knows what pope wants.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.270
Which is why she burst in 

27:38.350 --> 27:39.650
on your murder room today,

27:39.760 --> 27:41.590
and now everybody else knows how pope feels.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.910
And you're not doing anything about it. Nothing.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.500
You just,it just goes on.

27:45.610 --> 27:47.480
Well, I don't know what you want me to do.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.000
I mean, I can't help how pope feels.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.720
See, that's why I'm mad, brenda.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.430
Because you can help how pope feels

27:52.510 --> 27:54.480
by being absolutely clear with him.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.060
I'll show you how it's done.All right,

27:57.130 --> 27:59.110
I will be clear about how I feel.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.710
I love you, brenda.

28:01.590 --> 28:02.960
I love you.

28:05.010 --> 28:07.000
How was that for clarity?

29:00.780 --> 29:02.780
Fritzy, is that you?

30:04.900 --> 30:07.320
Uh, chief? Chief?

30:08.080 --> 30:09.940
We searched kendall price's house.

30:10.020 --> 30:10.970
Do you need help there?

30:11.050 --> 30:12.280
No. No.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.150
Uh, and?

30:15.300 --> 30:17.750
We didn't find any letters from gerald curtis.

30:17.820 --> 30:19.600
So maybe she really did get rid of them.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.300
I don't think so.

30:24.450 --> 30:25.590
No.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.320
In fact, I'd be surprised

30:27.360 --> 30:28.850
if she dumped a single one.

30:29.710 --> 30:31.840
They may not be at her house,

30:31.920 --> 30:33.260
but they might be at school.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.150
So I think we should give father watson a call.

30:36.310 --> 30:37.450
Ok.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.460
It's my locker.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.210
Kendall, let me handle this.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.570
This is a violation of the students' trust.

30:43.610 --> 30:44.510
I think we probably should've--

30:44.580 --> 30:45.880
high school students don't have any

30:45.950 --> 30:47.670
reasonable expectation of privacy.

30:47.730 --> 30:49.400
There is no trust to violate.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.820
What this boils down to,father,

30:50.880 --> 30:52.240
is that I'm investigating the murder

30:52.320 --> 30:53.610
of a young boy who yesterday

30:53.690 --> 30:55.030
you compared to jesus christ.

30:55.100 --> 30:57.220
And now you are standing in my way here.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.920
Because you're using gerry's innocent love letters 

31:00.000 --> 31:02.560
to undue everything carl died for.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.080
I guess I'm not the only one listening to confession.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.290
So, you want to finish this now, father,

31:09.370 --> 31:10.460
or do you want us to post a guard

31:10.530 --> 31:11.530
around this locker while we get

31:11.600 --> 31:13.550
the archdiocese involved?

31:20.530 --> 31:22.120
Father watson, don'T.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.450
I'm sorry, kendall.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.300
We have no choice.

31:46.290 --> 31:48.840
In a timeline.February 3rd, first contact.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.930
March 12th,they start writing

31:51.000 --> 31:52.170
each other every other day.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.120
Then there's the first,

31:53.190 --> 31:54.830
I think I might love you from gerry,

31:54.950 --> 31:57.690
march 18th,and his happiness at her having said

31:57.760 --> 31:59.830
I love you back, march 23rd.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.980
May 2nd, he wishes some witness would

32:02.050 --> 32:03.650
come forward to clear his name,

32:03.730 --> 32:05.330
so he could get out of prison,

32:05.440 --> 32:08.070
and "wrap my arms around you."

32:08.150 --> 32:09.330
Signed, yours in christ,

32:09.410 --> 32:10.980
and then,please burn this.

32:11.050 --> 32:12.080
And then again on may 12th,

32:12.150 --> 32:13.270
"I pray every night that someone 

32:13.350 --> 32:15.450
will appear and tell the truth about what happened,"

32:15.520 --> 32:17.410
and then, like all the other letters,

32:17.480 --> 32:19.920
it's signed,yours in christ,please burn this.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.250
And then,for two weeks,no letters.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.500
When they start back up again,

32:23.580 --> 32:24.760
there's no mention of the gap.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.940
It's like it never happened.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.490
Then kendall's running errands for him.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.440
Forwarding mail,

32:28.500 --> 32:29.300
making phone calls,

32:29.420 --> 32:30.710
and then the idea of a new witness

32:30.790 --> 32:31.950
never pops back up.

32:32.020 --> 32:33.100
She was forwarding mail?To whom?

32:33.190 --> 32:35.180
Gerald's mother in fullerton,his uncle,

32:35.250 --> 32:36.390
someone named stevie,

32:36.470 --> 32:38.300
and phone calls to him as well.

32:38.380 --> 32:39.600
Kendall's supposed to

32:39.670 --> 32:40.970
"ask if he got my letter.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.050
Tell him I need a response."

32:43.130 --> 32:44.960
Last letter was 8 days ago.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.060
"Call stevie and tell him I'm coming to town,

32:48.140 --> 32:50.120
and I still don't know what he wants to do."

32:50.200 --> 32:51.760
Did detective ross bring back

32:51.830 --> 32:52.650
the booking photos of known 

32:52.720 --> 32:54.410
perps matching carl's description?

32:54.490 --> 32:56.510
Yes, he said none of them were witnesses.

32:56.620 --> 32:58.150
Ok, let's look for someone named

32:58.220 --> 33:01.040
steven, steve, stevie,initial S.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.870
Detective sanchez,would you help her with that?

33:02.940 --> 33:05.260
Sergeant gabriel,do we have mr. Curtis' rap sheet?

33:05.340 --> 33:06.860
Uh, yeah, but it's a little sketchy.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.270
Most of his offenses were committed

33:08.390 --> 33:09.410
when he was a minor.

33:09.490 --> 33:12.310
That's ok, I just need the dates of his arrests.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.260
Excuse me.

33:14.370 --> 33:15.680
Sorry to interrupt.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.240
Just wanted to say a word or two

33:18.270 --> 33:20.220
about what happened here yesterday.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.790
That's not necessary,commander. Thank you.

33:23.220 --> 33:24.680
Well, it is.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.710
Just had a long conversation with the chief,

33:27.790 --> 33:29.960
and he feels it's in the department's best interest

33:30.040 --> 33:32.190
if I help put this episode 

33:32.270 --> 33:34.030
with estelle pope behind us.

33:34.150 --> 33:37.400
Especially considering the success rate of your division.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.430
And the long and the short of it is...

33:43.600 --> 33:46.140
there's nothing substantive to the terrible things

33:46.210 --> 33:48.030
that were said about chief johnson.

33:48.530 --> 33:50.470
And I'm also supposed to remind everyone

33:50.550 --> 33:52.540
that there's a big blue line at the door in this building,

33:52.620 --> 33:54.870
and estelle pope crossed over it.

33:54.930 --> 33:56.620
And I hope we all know how to behave

33:56.700 --> 33:59.700
when one of our own is falsely accused.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.900
So...pardon me for interrupting.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.620
And if you need any further 

34:06.710 --> 34:08.780
help with this problem chief johnson,

34:09.650 --> 34:11.040
you know where I am.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.800
Thank you, commander,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.659
for that spontaneous defense of my honor.

34:15.770 --> 34:17.040
My pleasure, ma'am.

34:17.699 --> 34:19.020
My pleasure.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.190
You know they made him

34:25.270 --> 34:26.449
come down here and say that.

34:26.489 --> 34:28.050
Yes, that's exactly what happened, lieutenant.

34:28.090 --> 34:29.719
They agreed on their story,and they 

34:30.590 --> 34:33.100
went over what they wanted him to say.

34:36.130 --> 34:38.750
I, uh, found 4 steves,and 

34:38.790 --> 34:40.699
this one, steven brand,

34:40.770 --> 34:44.080
arrested 8:45,october 15, 1998,

34:44.159 --> 34:45.639
possession of a controlled substance

34:45.719 --> 34:47.090
by hollywood division.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.980
Gerald curtis,arrested october 15, 1998,

34:50.060 --> 34:52.310
8:45pm, possession of a controlled substance

34:52.350 --> 34:53.570
by hollywood division.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.699
Steven brand arrested by valley division.

34:55.739 --> 34:58.900
Breaking and entering,robbery,on august 3rd.

34:58.940 --> 35:00.040
Gerald curtis arrested by 

35:00.120 --> 35:01.830
valley division on august 3, 2000.

35:01.910 --> 35:04.350
Both sentenced to juvie for a year and a half.

35:04.420 --> 35:06.790
Steven and gerry were partners.

35:09.390 --> 35:10.650
We arrested steven brand 

35:10.740 --> 35:12.750
and executed a search of his apartment

35:12.820 --> 35:14.120
and his car looking for weapons

35:14.190 --> 35:16.250
or any mail forwarded from folsom.

35:16.330 --> 35:18.670
We found what we believe to be the murder weapon,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.500
a 9 millimeter pistol used to kill carl nelson,

35:21.580 --> 35:24.180
under the driver's seat of his black honda accord.

35:24.370 --> 35:26.140
We also found letters to the suspect

35:26.210 --> 35:28.980
from gerald curtis in a lockbox under his bed.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.620
Subsequent to the search,

35:30.700 --> 35:31.710
we checked phone records and discovered

35:31.820 --> 35:34.440
that steven had received 4 phone calls from you

35:34.750 --> 35:35.700
kendall.

35:37.890 --> 35:40.420
Is this the guy gerry had you forwarding mail to?

35:40.500 --> 35:42.670
As you can see,he's white,

35:42.740 --> 35:43.960
he's got dirty blonde hair,

35:44.080 --> 35:46.170
a scar running from his mouth to his chin,

35:46.250 --> 35:47.430
and if he were to stand up,

35:47.470 --> 35:48.500
he'd be pretty tall.

35:48.570 --> 35:50.610
Does that description sound familiar,

35:50.680 --> 35:52.810
or do you need a red bandana to jog your memory?

35:54.310 --> 35:55.150
Kendall.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.540
What'd you do?

35:57.610 --> 35:59.140
Nothing, father.

35:59.210 --> 36:00.970
I...

36:01.200 --> 36:03.300
he just wanted steven to know 

36:03.330 --> 36:04.730
that he was back in town.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.640
To have him come visit in jail.

36:06.710 --> 36:08.080
They were friends,

36:08.160 --> 36:11.740
and gerry said that steven was still using drugs,

36:11.810 --> 36:14.250
and that he wanted to talk to him

36:14.330 --> 36:16.690
about how sobriety had made a change in his life.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.520
That's all.

36:17.590 --> 36:18.580
I have looked through the letters

36:18.650 --> 36:19.850
that gerry sent you from prison,

36:19.920 --> 36:21.600
and I think some of them are missing, kendall.

36:22.350 --> 36:23.800
You have everything.

36:24.590 --> 36:26.300
Look, you're making things 

36:26.380 --> 36:27.600
very difficult for me 

36:27.750 --> 36:29.780
because like many hardened criminals,

36:29.860 --> 36:31.860
your friend steven here has asked for an attorney.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.930
That means we cannot question him directly.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.280
You've got information I need, kendall.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.490
And you're not telling me.

36:39.570 --> 36:41.130
We'd like to do this without arresting you.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.910
Buzz, could you please turn on that other monitor?

36:47.980 --> 36:48.750
Yes, ma'am.

36:50.830 --> 36:51.850
Gerry.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.620
I'm gonna give you one more run at this, kendall.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.520
I want you to listen very closely

36:58.600 --> 36:59.970
to what gerry has to say.

37:05.030 --> 37:06.940
Thank you, officer.

37:08.010 --> 37:09.610
Ma'am, it's great to see you again.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.120
You, too, gerald.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.500
I hope I'm not disturbing your sleep too much.

37:13.580 --> 37:14.330
You've got your motion

37:14.360 --> 37:15.890
for a new child tomorrow, right?

37:15.960 --> 37:17.070
Yes, ma'am.

37:17.150 --> 37:19.130
Well, you'll probably be glad to hear

37:19.200 --> 37:21.600
that we found the person who murdered carl nelson.

37:22.130 --> 37:23.260
Steven brand.

37:23.750 --> 37:26.540
He also matched the description that carl gave

37:26.810 --> 37:29.390
of the person who shot the korean couple.

37:29.470 --> 37:30.770
He's not talking, of course.

37:30.840 --> 37:31.410
He has a lawyer.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.990
Wow, that's amazing.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.390
When did you find him?

37:35.460 --> 37:36.750
Couple hours ago.

37:37.510 --> 37:40.570
So the only thing I have left for you

37:40.650 --> 37:43.730
is a question or two about some letters

37:43.810 --> 37:46.230
that we found in his apartment from you

37:46.310 --> 37:48.300
forwarded to him by a young girl

37:48.380 --> 37:49.940
by the name of kendall price.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.540
You know kendall.

37:51.620 --> 37:53.090
You kept a picture of her.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.100
In your cell at folsom. 

37:56.430 --> 37:58.330
She was one of several young ladies

37:58.410 --> 37:59.990
you had photographs of.

38:00.430 --> 38:03.330
So who are these women,by the way, 

38:03.400 --> 38:05.160
whose pictures you had up in your cell?

38:05.270 --> 38:08.810
Uh, just girls that I write to.

38:08.890 --> 38:12.070
Or who write to me.Some of my girlfriends.

38:12.180 --> 38:14.250
Was kendall one of your girlfriends?

38:15.130 --> 38:18.260
No. Not really.No.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.120
She was, uh...

38:20.220 --> 38:21.850
too young for me.

38:22.230 --> 38:23.290
Really?

38:23.710 --> 38:25.730
That's not what you said in the letters

38:25.800 --> 38:26.910
that you wrote to her.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.950
Ok...look.

38:32.020 --> 38:32.920
I was nice to her 

38:32.990 --> 38:34.440
because she wrote me all this...

38:34.520 --> 38:36.230
like fan mail.

38:36.340 --> 38:39.560
And I didn't want to hurt her feelings.That's all.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.800
Let's see if that story matches

38:41.880 --> 38:43.370
what you told steven brand.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.830
Your friend that kendall forwarded mail to.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.040
Look, here it is.

38:49.030 --> 38:51.010
"Dear stevie, good news.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.080
"One of my girlfriends,

38:52.150 --> 38:53.680
I've mentioned her to you before,

38:53.750 --> 38:54.870
"butterface."

38:55.650 --> 38:57.180
I think I know that nickname.

38:57.260 --> 38:58.860
Doesn't that refer to a girl

38:58.930 --> 39:01.730
who has a great figure but her face isn't so great?

39:02.450 --> 39:04.630
Maybe you meant something else by it.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.180
No? Let's go on.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.020
"Butterface has helped me find

39:09.090 --> 39:11.760
"a witness to the murders I was falsely accused of.

39:11.830 --> 39:15.680
"His name is carl nelson,of 4503 patterson drive,

39:15.750 --> 39:18.420
and he's a 16-year-old boy who wears glasses.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.630
Gosh, that sounds an awful lot like

39:19.700 --> 39:21.130
you did know who carl was

39:21.210 --> 39:22.950
before your lawyers mentioned him.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.050
See, this postmark was dated two weeks ago.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.050
Well, it's just...

39:30.170 --> 39:32.030
just chock-a-block with surprises.

39:32.110 --> 39:33.520
This letter, isn't it?

39:33.600 --> 39:35.850
Well, let's go on.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.900
"Carl," there's his name again,

39:37.980 --> 39:39.820
"was actually in the kwikmart

39:39.900 --> 39:41.380
"when the murders took place.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.550
"And has just finished giving a sworn deposition

39:43.630 --> 39:46.680
"describing the real killer."As being a tall, blonde man

39:46.750 --> 39:49.420
"with a scar from his mouth to his chin.

39:49.490 --> 39:51.550
"I know you'll be happy to have this information.

39:51.630 --> 39:53.130
"Just goes to show you,doesn't it,

39:53.240 --> 39:56.790
"that things are never over.Yours in christ. Gerry."

39:58.280 --> 39:59.800
Here's what I believe.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.750
I think you had a lot of time in prison

40:02.820 --> 40:04.160
to plan how you might get out.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.200
And that you corresponded 

40:05.260 --> 40:07.390
with a lot of susceptible young women

40:07.460 --> 40:09.140
who you hoped would lie for you.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.320
Or get a friend to lie.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.710
And that kendall did just that.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.200
And you know what else I think...

40:14.270 --> 40:15.870
stupid, stupid girl.

40:15.950 --> 40:18.010
I think the description that carl gave

40:18.080 --> 40:19.900
was probably that of steven brand

40:19.980 --> 40:21.650
who I believe drove you away

40:21.730 --> 40:23.530
 from the kwikmart after the robberies.

40:23.610 --> 40:26.230
To your defense attorneys,

40:26.270 --> 40:28.710
you thought that steven might be scared

40:28.780 --> 40:29.990
into killing him.

40:30.330 --> 40:31.670
And you were right.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.310
I wonder how steven will feel 

40:33.390 --> 40:36.000
when he knows that you gave a description out?

40:36.310 --> 40:38.290
But you can't trust anyone these days.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.770
Go to hell.I want my lawyer.

40:39.890 --> 40:41.920
And especially,you couldn't trust carl,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.980
a 16-year-old boy who might fall to pieces

40:44.020 --> 40:46.150
on the witness stand,if examined too closely.

40:46.220 --> 40:47.590
And if I were to find out that you had written

40:47.670 --> 40:49.950
all that out for kendall so that she could help carl

40:50.030 --> 40:52.760
make his testimony more believable, why,

40:52.880 --> 40:54.450
that would be as good as a confession.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.630
I said, go to hell.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.150
You first.

41:11.310 --> 41:13.030
I have the letters.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.010
I have them.

41:16.750 --> 41:19.560
I talked carl into saying he was there.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.200
He had a crush on me,and I...

41:23.690 --> 41:26.280
father watson,I was just trying--

41:28.760 --> 41:32.360
oh, my god.Oh, my god, oh, my god.

41:33.300 --> 41:34.700
I killed him.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.480
Oh, god, I killed him.

41:46.310 --> 41:48.220
I had no idea that gerry

41:48.290 --> 41:49.450
had asked someone to lie for him.

41:49.530 --> 41:51.070
I had no idea. None.

41:51.570 --> 41:53.390
Unfortunately, father,

41:54.080 --> 41:56.320
you don't answer to me.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.990
I'm so sorry.

42:31.190 --> 42:33.280
So did you find gerry's other letters?

42:33.970 --> 42:34.810
Yes. 

42:34.880 --> 42:36.520
Kendall kept them in her bible

42:36.560 --> 42:38.580
that she got for confirmation.

42:38.650 --> 42:40.390
And this is the letter 

42:40.490 --> 42:42.430
that really does it for gerald curtis.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.650
Writes out the entire script for carl,

42:44.730 --> 42:46.000
and it's filled with stuff

42:46.070 --> 42:47.410
that only the shooter would know about.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.120
And it's in his own hand.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.960
All right. You think that'll convince a judge?

42:51.040 --> 42:54.800
Yeah. And he signed it yours in christ.

42:57.900 --> 42:59.490
So I hope taylor's visit

42:59.560 --> 43:00.950
cleared everything up for you.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.700
I hope so, too.

43:03.470 --> 43:05.830
You're not mad at me about all this, are you?

43:05.910 --> 43:07.550
No. It's not your fault.

43:09.690 --> 43:11.900
You doing some house cleaning?

43:11.970 --> 43:13.270
What?

43:14.500 --> 43:15.520
Yeah--oh.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.000
Yes...just a little.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.300
Ok, all right.

43:19.370 --> 43:20.380
Well, as long as we're good.

43:21.100 --> 43:22.050
Good work.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.960
Hey! Hey!

43:27.400 --> 43:29.480
Hey, that tune you're whistling.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.120
That's the ring on my new cell phone.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.810
Oh, that's what I keep forgetting to tell you.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.310
Your purse.It's in my office.

43:36.960 --> 43:37.960
You must have left it there

43:38.030 --> 43:39.480
sometime this week during all the...

43:40.230 --> 43:41.230
I'll go get it.

43:41.310 --> 43:43.750
No, that's ok.I'll come up, and...

43:44.050 --> 43:44.750
ok.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.200
I have something, uh...

43:46.810 --> 43:48.580
I do have something 

43:48.650 --> 43:49.980
I want to say to you.

43:50.630 --> 43:51.470
So...

43:52.070 --> 43:53.340
will you wait?

43:53.420 --> 43:54.430
Sure.

43:54.510 --> 43:55.610
Ok.But you don't have to 

43:55.690 --> 43:58.200
say anything.

43:58.270 --> 44:00.980
I mean...is it about us?

44:02.830 --> 44:04.180
Well, uh...

44:04.260 --> 44:06.000
'cause we're, you know,we're good.

44:08.290 --> 44:12.290
I, uh, I know, brenda.

44:13.700 --> 44:15.130
I get it.

44:15.590 --> 44:16.880
We're good.

44:18.020 --> 44:19.320
So you gonna be long?

44:19.390 --> 44:21.280
I'll...just be a minute.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.270
Ok. 

44:22.660 --> 44:23.850
All right, great.
