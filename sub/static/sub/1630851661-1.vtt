00:23.400 --> 00:27.000
There's something fucking
desperately wrong with him and...

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
...he needs fucking help.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Good luck to him, good luck to him
and anyone that's helping him...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
because he's fucked... i'm telling you.

00:35.013 --> 00:36.961
Neville Bartos has
been in hiding since...

00:36.961 --> 00:41.306
Chopper shot and narrowly missed
killing him for the second time.

00:41.306 --> 00:42.779
You see that's a good bloody wound.

00:42.779 --> 00:44.600
— Do you see that?
— Of course I bloody can!

00:44.600 --> 00:48.400
...I let him in,
I said hello, I was a friend.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.000
- And he did it again...
- That's right!

00:53.400 --> 00:55.800
So what have you got to
say to people who say...

00:55.800 --> 00:59.000
"He's a real bad piece of work,
he's criminally insane."

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
- Who says that?
- Well Neville Bartos for one.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.400
That bloody sook!

01:03.400 --> 01:05.600
Is he still crying is he?

01:05.900 --> 01:08.225
Neville shouldn't have stepped
into the criminal world unless...

01:08.225 --> 01:09.992
he was prepared to
put body on the line.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.200
The average man on the street
doesn't worry about Chopper Read.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.000
The average man on the street, he likes
me, he couldn't care less about me.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
What I do, he applauds.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
And now they're saying...

01:22.000 --> 01:25.600
the proceeds of my bullshit should
go to these victims of crime.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.200
Who are my victims?
Proceeds of crime!

01:29.200 --> 01:32.200
Do you wanna see money go to the
drug dealers? I perish the thought.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.200
I ain't got nothing on my
conscience for killing a few druggies.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.000
The drugs are far as i'm concerned...

01:39.000 --> 01:42.400
they completely the criminal world...

01:42.400 --> 01:45.000
And in my opinion they'll
probably ruin normal society.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
That's right, that's what he said before.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.400
You seem to have a hatred for humanity.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.600
Humanity doesn't like me. That's
why i'm always sitting here talking.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.800
I'm a bloody freak show.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.600
He's waving at us!

02:01.600 --> 02:03.800
Chopper!
He's waving at us!

02:03.800 --> 02:07.000
The average person watching
this thinks i'm a bloody freak.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.199
What's your opinion?

02:09.199 --> 02:14.000
I'm just a normal bloke, a normal
bloke that likes a bit of torture!

03:47.800 --> 03:50.800
You see that line there?
That's your side of the yard.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.600
You stay that side of the
yard, we'll stay this side.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.400
Good, you got that knucklehead?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.200
What's he done to his hair?

04:17.200 --> 04:21.399
That's boot polish mate. 
Lynx forgot to pick up the powder.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.600
Poor old bugger.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.800
Nice to see your bald
patch has gone Keith.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It looks good mate.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.000
I like it.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
So you're not gonna get me then Keith?

04:44.400 --> 04:47.000
Not worth doing any
more time over you maggot.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.600
Keithy, you'll get off on self defence.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.200
All you gotta do is kill me...

04:51.200 --> 04:53.600
present my psychiatric
records to the court...

04:53.600 --> 04:55.800
There's not a jury in the
land that'll convict you.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.800
You fucking sick, Read.
You're insane.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.600
Beethoven had his critics too Keith.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.200
See if you can name 3 of them.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.800
That's right, you can't.

05:09.956 --> 05:12.126
Why don't you do yourself a
favour and shut up you cunt.

05:12.126 --> 05:14.154
You're a parrot, fucking blowfly!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Ah Keith, I always
thought I was a good bloke.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.000
- What did you ever do that was good?
- Well I bashed you.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.600
That was good, wasn't it? It was
good for a bit of a giggle anyway.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.200
Hey Keithy?

05:27.668 --> 05:30.446
Come on Keith,
you should thank me.

05:30.779 --> 05:32.438
You're gonna hit the knees
doing regular panel beating.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.800
Fuck him, who does he think he is?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
He knows who he is.
He's Keithy George.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.000
He's the painters and dockers mate.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.600
Out there he's the
painters and dockers.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
In here he's just another
bare bum in the shower.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.600
Why do you hate him so much?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I don't hate him,
I don't hate anybody.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.800
Well why have we been
fighting for 3 fucking years?

06:05.800 --> 06:06.600
I don't know.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.600
- Mate, we should have a reason.
- We'll make one up.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
Over here.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.000
Step in, Mark.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.600
Mr. Cole?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.000
What the fuck's
going on down there?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.400
Keithy's done himself a mischief.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
Hurry up!

07:32.600 --> 07:34.400
I'll be on down in a minute.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.800
You alright Keith?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.600
It's alright Keith, you're not
going to bleed to death.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.800
They called the screws.
The screws are coming.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.600
- Want a cigarette Keith?
- Get away from me!

08:07.400 --> 08:08.600
It's alright mate.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.800
Have a cigarette Keith.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.000
Keithy, come on mate.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.800
You don't much like me do you?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.800
You bash people for no reason
just to make a name for yourself.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.600
You're a fucking idiot.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.000
I'm not a dumb cumless piece of blood Keith.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm the one who runs a division.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.799
Make no mistake about that.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.800
What's going on here?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.400
No sweat.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Keithy seems to have
done himself a mischief.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Stay back fellas!
Keep everyone away!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.600
Alright Keithy?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.200
Off you go mate.
Off to the sickbay.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.800
Whinge, whinge, fucking whinge!

09:16.200 --> 09:17.600
Nice late one tonight sir.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.200
I don't mind Mark,
I get double pay.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.800
- Bit of overtime?
- It'll do me.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
Enjoy.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.200
Bloody put my shoulder out.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.200
What?

09:44.200 --> 09:47.600
This is DSS Creswell, DS Wyatt.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.000
They're from the
prisoner liaison office.

09:50.292 --> 09:52.140
They're investigating the
incident that happened in...

09:52.140 --> 09:53.693
H division yesterday
involving prisoner George.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.800
At this stage I must inform you that
you're not obliged to say anything...

09:56.800 --> 09:59.800
And anything you do say may
be given in evidence, understand?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.200
All I can tell you is
what I told Mr Beazley.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.200
None of us saw anything,
it's just one of those things.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.800
Bluey Barnes was reading a magazine...

10:10.200 --> 10:12.400
Ambrose Atcheson was taking a piss...

10:13.600 --> 10:16.000
Johnny Price was washing his hands...

10:16.400 --> 10:19.000
Jimmy Loughnan was watching a
bull ant crawl  across the table...

10:19.000 --> 10:21.600
And I was watching
Jimmy watch the bull ant.

10:22.067 --> 10:25.265
Sadly, none of us are gonna be
able to help you on this occasion...

10:25.467 --> 10:26.280
as much as we'd like to.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.800
I put it to you that that's not the truth.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.600
Look, I didn't stab Keithy George.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.600
I had nothing to do with what
happened to Keithy George, alright.

10:39.891 --> 10:41.448
And i'm sure when he
wakes from his slumber...

10:41.655 --> 10:43.200
he'll swear to God
that I didn't stab him.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.400
He's not gonna wake up Mark,
he died this morning.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.200
It's not a good thing.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.600
The sort of thing
that'll come back at you.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.800
Don't get all spooky on me.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.883
I'll dream about that
shit for a while, big deal.

11:09.883 --> 11:10.953
I'll keep my feet on the ground.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.400
That's not what he's talking about,
he's talking about the dockers

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
They have to get us
back now don't they?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.600
What do you want me to do about it?

11:18.600 --> 11:22.200
Just fucking lie there while
he's stabbing me to death?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.400
That would've been wise wouldn't it?

11:24.400 --> 11:28.000
We didn't want to start it up
again, this is fucking whack!

11:31.200 --> 11:32.200
That's the fucking whack!

11:33.600 --> 11:34.400
Bluey!

11:35.600 --> 11:36.800
Get fucked!

11:37.400 --> 11:38.600
About bloody time Blue!

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
Don't get angry Blue. You lose your
edge you lose your perspective.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.200
You can't make friends with your enemies.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.800
Even when peace time is declared,
they're all still fucking enemies.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.200
Aren't they?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.800
No one's ever forgotten Blue,
it's just human fucking nature.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.600
My money's always been on you Mark.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.200
The dockers are very threatened at
what's happened to Keithy George.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
You've really put them in a corner.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.600
I don't know how
serious to take this but...

12:10.600 --> 12:13.400
There's a rumour going around that
they've put a contract out on you.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
How much?

12:17.400 --> 12:20.000
That's been passed round,
5 of the dockers have put in...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.400
$2,000 each to have you knocked.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.600
Not bad. I should have a go myself.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.600
It all sounds a liitle ridiculous doesn't it?
Who are they gonna get to do it?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.200
Take you pick Mark.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.800
All we gotta do is grab two screws...

12:46.800 --> 12:51.600
knives to their throats, take their keys,
march them up to the scullery...

12:51.600 --> 12:53.200
lock them in the scullery.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.600
Then get matchsticks,
stick them in the keyholes...

12:55.600 --> 12:58.200
seperating the gates
from the divison, right?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.400
Then we ring the alarm bells...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
We pick up the phone to Governer Beazley...

13:02.800 --> 13:05.200
And we tell him we've
got two screws hostage...

13:05.200 --> 13:08.000
and we've taken the
entire division to siege.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.600
Then we'll grab the keys, go
through the whole joint, cell by cell...

13:12.600 --> 13:16.000
and I will icepick the fucking spines
of every prisoner in this division.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.400
Make paraplegics of all of them.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.600
Turn them all into jelly sandwiches.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.400
- I don't wanna be in it.
- Are you a girl's dress.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.800
I don't care what you say.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.200
The blokes down there haven't got
$10,000. They haven't got 10,000 cents.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
They haven't got
any sense at all mate.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.800
It's simple, we do it all in
one night. We go swoop...

13:41.800 --> 13:44.000
Wake up in the morning, problem solved.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.000
I've got my appeal going.
I don't wanna fuck it up.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.000
You'll be in it though won't you?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.600
Do I have to remind
you of certain things?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.400
- You're never gonna let me forget
that fucking judge are you? - No.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.000
And as for you, you knucklehead...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.400
When it starts you jump straight in.

14:10.400 --> 14:15.200
If you stand there thinking about it for
two fucking seconds you are back there...

14:15.200 --> 14:18.200
In the yard, crying, like
when I first met you. Right?

14:20.825 --> 14:21.214
Yeah.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.476
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.600
Want a smoke?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.800
Ta Jimmy.

14:33.667 --> 14:37.645
Anyway, Swallow didn't come out.

14:37.645 --> 14:39.022
He said to wait till the next morning.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.800
So I was thinking mate,
I saw him in the dunny...

14:42.800 --> 14:45.400
He was there with the
toothpick trying to go at it.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.200
It's a bit early in the morning
for kung-fu isn't it Jim?

14:53.400 --> 14:54.600
What's the matter with you?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.800
Hang on a second.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.400
What are you doing?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
What's got into you?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.400
Come here mate.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.000
Sorry, Chop.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
It's alright.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.200
Shit!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.400
Jim if you keep stabbing me
you're gonna kill me, right?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.800
You can let go.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.400
I can't let you go Jimmy,
you've got a knife in your hand.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You let me go i'll drop that shiv.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.800
You drop the knife
and then i'll let you go.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.000
You let me go i'll drop the shiv, i'll drop off.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.599
Let go of the knife Jimmy.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.800
Ok i'll drop off, let go of my hands.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.800
I'm gonna let you go, ok?
Go and sit down.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.600
Terrific sneak Jim, bloody terrific.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.600
You obviously listened
and learnt well didn't you?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.600
Always give credit where credit is due.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.600
I give you top marks for treachery.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.000
Blue, you're bloody useless.

18:07.000 --> 18:07.800
You alright Chop?

18:09.200 --> 18:10.400
Yeah i'm alright.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.800
- Jesus mate, does it hurt?
- No.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.800
I think you'd better lie down..

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
What for?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.800
It'll do you good mate.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.400
Come on let me help out,
you'd better lie down and lie still.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.600
Just like that.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.000
Sorry Chop.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
Sorry.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.400
- Cut me. - No, I can't
fucking cut you mate!

19:36.400 --> 19:38.600
Bluey, cut me!

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
I can't cut you mate.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.000
- I can't do it.
- Pussy fucker...

19:46.000 --> 19:48.800
- Put the knife down.
- He's a madman, he attacked me.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
Put the knife down.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.200
- Ok, he attacked me first.
- Put the knife down.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.800
We're not letting anyone out of
here until the knife goes on the table.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.600
- He's a psycho, just get him out of here.
- Put it on the table Jim!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.400
Put it down!

20:05.800 --> 20:09.200
Chopper went fucking mad!
He fucking tried to stab Jimmy.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.800
He attacked him first.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.000
He attacked me first boss, right?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.400
How about getting someone
to look at my arm?

20:26.200 --> 20:27.600
How are you Mark?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Are you prepared
to make a statement?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.800
The bloke's been my
best mate since 1975.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.400
We've had our fallouts from
time to time, that's no big deal.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.400
If your mum stabs you what do you do?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.600
You don't get upset,
you don't get angry.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.600
You go "Shit, mum's stabbed me,
i'd better get to the hospital."

20:56.400 --> 20:58.600
He's made a statement against you Mark.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.400
No he hasn't.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.000
Have a look at that.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.200
That's not Jimmy,
Jimmy wouldn't do that.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.200
He's done it.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.400
He's also filed a claim with the
victims of crime compensation board.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.800
Victims of crime,
how much can he get?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.200
$5,000.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.800
Jimmy Loughnan,
a bloody victim fo crime?!

21:35.800 --> 21:37.800
Shit. Cheeky dog!

21:39.600 --> 21:41.000
If he's charged...

21:41.400 --> 21:44.000
Does that mean I can
lay a claim against him?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.800
Is that you Jimmy?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
You weak cunt!

22:05.600 --> 22:09.600
You coulda had me but you lost
your guts at the last second didn't ya?

22:10.800 --> 22:13.200
I tell you Jim,
if i'd had had the knife...

22:13.200 --> 22:16.400
you wouldn't have got a stab in the
arm, i'd have cut your fucking head off!

22:18.600 --> 22:21.000
Mark, why you
ganging up against Jim?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.400
He's the one who made the
first statement against me.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
Cops were gonna charge me
with attempted murder...

22:26.400 --> 22:29.600
because of a statement made by
Jimmy, my-lips-are-sealed Loughnan.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.200
The prick even filed a victims
of crime compo claim against me.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.400
But he's the one who's
been charged Mark.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.000
You can't stand up in court against him.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.600
Who do you think I am
blue? The Red Cross?

22:42.600 --> 22:44.600
I'm not running some public charity here.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.800
Mark, you know i've always
had a lot of time for you but...

22:48.800 --> 22:51.600
Jimmy's the one who's been charged.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.600
I think the main thing,
you know Mark...

22:54.600 --> 22:58.600
Is that Jim doesn't get
more jail out of this.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.200
"Jimmy doesn't get any
more jail out of this"

23:01.200 --> 23:03.800
Well he'd better get himself a
real fucking lawyer then hadn't he?.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.400
The matter of the police
versus James Richard Loughnan.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.200
Mrs Newman is appearing
for the prosecution.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.800
The defendant is not represented.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.000
Mr Read, have you been searched prior to
your appearance in this courtroom today?

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, by all and sundry.
Everyone's had a go at it.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.200
And why do you think that is Mr Read?

23:24.200 --> 23:27.800
Well they search everyone,
especially you Mr Loughnan.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.000
I put it to you that the reason
you were searched so thoroughly...

23:33.000 --> 23:37.200
is because you have a history of
violent behaviour in courtrooms.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.200
Are you not currently serving
of 14 and a half years...

23:41.200 --> 23:44.000
for the attempted
abduction of a judge?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.200
That's 16 and a half years Jimmy.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.800
16 and a half years.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm told you used a shotgun in this
attempted abduction, is that so?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.200
Yeah, I had it right
here under my coat.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.400
- There ain't nothing don't there now.
- I wish there was.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.800
I bet you do. Who would you
like to use it on? This judge?

24:04.200 --> 24:05.600
No, i'd use it on you at the moment.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.200
Yeah, I bet you would.
You hold human life very cheaply?

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
Some human life yeah.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.200
You have a lot of hostility
towards me don't you?

24:14.600 --> 24:17.600
No, I perish the thought. I even lent
you that suit you're wearing today.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.200
You lent him that suit?

24:20.200 --> 24:23.600
Yeah, I realise it's not a
fashion competition your honour,

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600
but if he'd have worn
what he was gonna wear,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.200
you'd have given him
20 years for bad taste.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.000
I am a friend of yours am I not?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.000
It's been alleged that you are.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.200
And you are in fact serving
a sentence of 17 years...

24:40.200 --> 24:43.600
because you tried to free
me from jail, is that so?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.200
Yes.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.800
And yet you've told the court that I
attacked you on the morning of August 20?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.600
- Is that right?
- Yes.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.000
Why would I attack you Mr Read?

24:57.200 --> 24:58.800
Who knows how your mind works Jim.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.600
So all the people we've
heard in court today,

25:05.600 --> 25:09.400
some of them you consider
to be your friends,

25:09.400 --> 25:11.400
they're all telling lies?

25:11.800 --> 25:15.000
Just a group of people banding
together to find a common enemy.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.800
- Even your friends?
- Oh yeah.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.600
Armed police surrounded
Brunswick court today during...

25:22.600 --> 25:26.000
a case involving notorious
criminal Mark Brandon Read.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.600
Read was giving evidence in the communal
proceedings of fellow prisoner James...

25:29.800 --> 25:30.800
Figure this out Blue.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.400
I'm the one on trial, he's
the one all over the news.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.000
That's a nice little photo of you Jimmy...

25:39.800 --> 25:41.400
A nice little photo.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.600
You are sucha  fucking
show pony, aren't you?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.400
You could use that in your passport.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.800
You fucking bighead wanker!

25:51.000 --> 25:53.200
Keithy was right about you mate.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.200
You bash people for no reason
just to get a name for yourself.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.200
Well one day they'll write
a book about me Jimmy.

25:59.200 --> 26:03.200
And when you grow old and your
grandchildren ask you did in your heyday...

26:03.200 --> 26:05.800
you'll be able to say,
with great pride...

26:05.800 --> 26:09.800
that you couldn't kill Mark Chopper
Read. That'll be your claim to fame.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.000
You ever used a fucking gun Jimmy?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You hear that Chopper?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.200
You're dead no mate,
you've got no friends left.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
You think I fucking give a shit?!

26:35.400 --> 26:39.000
Now if you could just see it in your
hearts to move me to Sale.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.800
I'd be really appreciative.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.200
Geelong's a dirty old hole.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.200
Come on Mark, you're classified
as a maximum security prisoner.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.600
You're in here convicted
of a very serious offence.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.000
I suppose a bribe's
out of the question?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.200
Mark, this is not a joke.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.400
I'm not joking, i'll be getting
$5,000 crimes compo...

26:57.400 --> 27:00.000
When Jimmy and I finish
up at the supreme court.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.000
Look Mark, a bribe
is out of the question.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.400
- You're not going anywhere.
- But if I stay in here i'm dead.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.600
Well i'm sorry about that
but nothing can be done.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.200
Mr Beazley?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Mr Beazley.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.400
Righto, i'm out of H Division today.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.800
You're not going anywhere Mark.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.400
Let's go!

27:37.800 --> 27:38.800
Don't saw at it!

27:39.600 --> 27:40.800
I'm trying to be gentle mate.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.600
You fucking idiot!

27:42.600 --> 27:45.400
Rip into it!
Slash it off!

27:47.000 --> 27:48.800
Don't do it!

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
The other one.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.600
You're not gonna
get me for this later?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.800
Just get on with it you
fucking fairy, rip into it!

28:08.600 --> 28:10.200
Good fucking job Mark.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.000
Get a screw would ya.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.600
- You're fucking bleeding Chop!
- Boss!

28:16.600 --> 28:18.482
You've gotta stop the bleeding, ok?

28:18.482 --> 28:21.005
You're gonna need cold water, you're
gonna get yourself into the shower.

28:21.005 --> 28:22.600
You're talking to me now eh?

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
After all i've done for you.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.000
I took you from tears to fucking
glory and you do this to me!

28:32.800 --> 28:36.000
I'm not angry at you Jim, you
just broke my heart, that's all.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.000
What's going on?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.400
Chopper cut his fucking ears off!

28:42.000 --> 28:43.400
Not gonna get out of H divison eh?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.800
You practically ran
down and carried me out.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.400
Haven't ya? Look at ya.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.400
Get him out!

28:49.400 --> 28:53.400
I told you i'd get out didn't I?
Have a look who's leaving!

28:54.800 --> 28:55.800
Get him out!

28:57.800 --> 29:01.200
It's no big deal boss, they can
be bloody sewed to the nines.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.400
You're looking at
my ears aren't you?

30:02.400 --> 30:05.000
Well you weren;t thinking of me
when you did that were you?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.600
I missed you Bub.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
Did you?

30:30.800 --> 30:34.400
I'm out of it now, right?
I made it as a top street fighter.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.400
I made it as a top criminal, i've
got nothing to prove any further.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.000
You gotta keep moving
forward otherwise you'll perish.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.200
There's no point going backwards,
you gotta keep going forwards.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.400
Give me your arm.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.000
No my left arm.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.200
Shut up!

30:52.800 --> 30:54.000
Give me your arm.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.600
- You know I hate it like that.
- It's just a bit of goey.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.000
You alright?

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Hey you there?
Hang on, i'll check.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
You've given up crime eh?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.400
Mark? Is that you?

31:34.800 --> 31:36.200
Oh dad sorry, you're asleep.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.200
Come in here Mark.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.200
No you're alright,
you go to sleep dad.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.400
Come in here. You haven't been out for
10 years. Where've you been all day?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.600
You look tired dad,
you go back to sleep.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.400
No, get in here. Get in here
and talk to your old dad.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.400
You've been away for 10 years.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.000
I've been sitting here waiting all day
for you. Don't sit there, sit over here.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.600
Sit over here in this chair.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.200
I've been sitting around
all day waiting for you.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.600
Do you want a drink?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.800
Good to have you home son.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Cheers big ears!

32:54.800 --> 32:56.400
Nice shirt son.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.200
What's wrong with it?

32:58.200 --> 32:59.400
Nothing, it's good, I like it.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.400
- You like it?
- Do they make 'em for men?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.800
Don't be a sook.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.400
I wrote to mum.
Told her I was getting out.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.800
Did you here anything from her?

33:24.800 --> 33:25.800
No.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.600
Of course you didn't.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.400
I heard your mate
Jimmy Loughnan's at large.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.600
That old chestnut.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.800
He beat the charge.
I always told you Mark:

33:42.800 --> 33:44.800
Your kindness'll be the death of you.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.200
He's fucked dad, he's
a bloody chronic junkie.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.400
Your mate.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.400
Life got him back in the end,
it all bloody equals out.

33:55.600 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, equals out alright! He stabs you in
the gut and he gets off, you do 10 years.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.600
All equals out... Your mate
Jimmy, Jimmy Loughnan.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Fuck it.

34:14.598 --> 34:17.873
No lovey, you walk on the inside,
gentlemen walks on the outside.

34:17.873 --> 34:19.056
It's called etiquette.

34:19.056 --> 34:19.934
Oh yeah?
Haven't heard that one before.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.400
It's from the days when
there were strong characters...

34:23.800 --> 34:25.800
Mud used to splach
up from the gutter.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.199
Just in case any mud splashes
up i'm here to protect you.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.600
Are you? Thanks sweetheart.

34:30.958 --> 34:32.380
Piss off! You're blocking the entrance.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
Chopper!

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
Good to see you out mate!

34:37.800 --> 34:39.000
Good to see you mate, looking great.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.199
- Keeo it down fellas.
- What?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.600
Just saying it's good
to see you out mate.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.800
It's like wearing a fucking sign on
me with you carrying on like that.

34:49.817 --> 34:50.891
We're just happy to see you out.

34:50.891 --> 34:52.800
Out and around.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.400
Good to see me is it?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.000
Have a good night.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.600
G'day Chopper,
I heard you were out.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.400
Are you kidding me?
You've forgotten?

35:47.400 --> 35:49.600
No no, you're fucking kidding me!

35:52.600 --> 35:53.400
Fuck, Neville.

35:53.400 --> 35:57.000
That's right mate, you
got it in one. Neville fucking Bartos.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.400
You see he did fucking
remember, of course he did.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.400
What was it mate?
What was it you forgot?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.600
How are you Nev? Are you good?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.400
What do you reckon?
Take a fucking look.

36:09.600 --> 36:14.000
Have a fucking look,
of course i'm fucking good.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.400
Listen Nev, about the leg...

36:24.400 --> 36:27.400
I'm sorry mate, it bloody upsets
me, it plays on my mind a bit.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.400
That was 10 years ago, it's water
under the bridge, just forget about it.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.200
No seriously, forget about it.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.000
Because i've forgotten about
it so don't worry about it.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.200
Plus i've a victim's compo
payout, pension awsell eh.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.600
Big bloody payout eh?
And not a drink in it for me...

36:47.600 --> 36:49.200
Not even a fucking thank you card.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.600
No, you got me there.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.000
What are you drinking?
I'll get you a fucking bottle.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
Because what's mine is yours.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.600
- Would your girl like a drink?
- Marsala and Coke.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.000
Marsala and Coke, good choice.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.400
Nick, I need some drinks over here quick.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I want a bottle of Marsala and
a bottle of Coke, and for you?

37:07.000 --> 37:07.600
Beer.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.600
Get us a couple of
beers too Nick, quick.

37:16.541 --> 37:17.349
Bloody look at him!

37:17.865 --> 37:19.861
Putting on that limp trying to
get me to feel sorry for him.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.200
Seemed alright.
Seems quite genuine.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.200
Well you would think he was genuine,
the way he staring into your eyes.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.400
No Mark.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.400
Fucking cripple!

37:39.200 --> 37:40.800
Don't worry about that.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.800
Don't worry about it.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.400
He's done very bloddy
well for himself too, hasn't he?

37:50.400 --> 37:52.800
Mark... leave him alone.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.400
Fuck, i've gotta nip this in the bud.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.400
Mark, don't...

38:09.400 --> 38:11.600
You're not still shit at
me about that leg are you?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.800
You're not still angry at
me about that leg are you?

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
Forget about it.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.400
I don't know if you remember Neville but
I had that shotgun pointed at your head.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.600
I was really considerate dropping
down to your kneecap remember?

38:25.600 --> 38:27.600
Forget about it, alright?

38:27.600 --> 38:31.200
What the hell were you doing
getting lippy with me with a shotgun?

38:31.600 --> 38:36.400
The leg is ok, alright?
Look at me.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm flying.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
Go back to your girl, relax.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.200
Forget the leg, i'll get
you another drink, alright?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.400
Chop Chop, how you doing?

39:11.800 --> 39:13.000
Who was that?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.600
He wanted a light.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.400
Just leave it,
don't worry about it.

39:24.658 --> 39:26.891
You look at me or you
look straight ahead...

39:26.891 --> 39:28.435
you don't make eye contact
with anyone, alright?

39:33.200 --> 39:34.600
What was that for?

39:35.200 --> 39:36.400
Come on, we're going.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.200
Fuck off Mark!

39:38.200 --> 39:40.000
Get your fucking jacket.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.200
I'm not going anywhere,
let go of me Mark!

39:46.203 --> 39:47.631
Put her on a leash mate.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.800
- What are you looking at hop-a-long?
- Nothing mate.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.600
You got a problem you fucking cripple!

39:55.600 --> 39:56.800
No pronblem between you and me.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.800
You wanna fucking finish it?

40:14.200 --> 40:16.000
I'm sorry baby.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.400
I get a bit bloody schizo or something.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.600
It's not easy you know, if I go out
everyone's staring at my ears...

40:28.600 --> 40:31.000
staring at my tattoos, you know?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.000
I've done some bad things but...

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I've done some bad things.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.200
Now i've got a bloody team of enemies.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.000
You should lay off the speed.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.600
I'm trying to think of the last time...

40:46.600 --> 40:49.800
I actually took
some time to be normal.

40:50.600 --> 40:55.000
Stood there and looked at a
bloody sunset or go to a bloody bar.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
I can't go to a bar, I can't
have a relaxed bloody meal.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
I can't go to a restaurant
and have a relaced bloody meal.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.800
I've gotta sit with my back against
the wall in case someone comes in.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.600
My luck can't last forever.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.800
I'll get us some money together.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.600
I've got some money coming in.

41:21.600 --> 41:25.400
Let's say you and I
go down to Tasmania...

41:26.200 --> 41:28.600
and me make our
own bloody life together?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.800
No offence but I think i'd rather
keep working at the brothel.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.000
I can't stop working babe, I tried.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.400
What's the matter honey?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.200
Who is he?

42:07.200 --> 42:09.400
It's fucking Neville fucking Bartos isn't it?

42:11.200 --> 42:13.000
Mark, you're not gonna
start all this again are you?

42:14.200 --> 42:16.000
I'm talking to you, who is he?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.200
Fuck! You're hurting me!

42:20.400 --> 42:21.800
Is it Neville Bartos?

42:21.800 --> 42:24.000
Let go, let go of me Mark!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.600
- Neville Bartos.
- Fucking let go of me!

42:30.400 --> 42:32.200
What is wrong with you?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.000
I fucking knew it!

42:38.400 --> 42:42.400
Just bloody tell me,
who are you fucking?

42:44.600 --> 42:45.600
Mark...

42:46.200 --> 42:49.000
Everyone...
I work in a fucking brothel.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.800
That's not what I mean, you know
what I mean, who are you kissing?

43:11.200 --> 43:12.000
You.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.400
See?

43:14.200 --> 43:15.800
I'm kissing you.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.000
You get away from me with
that mouth, it tastes of wog's cock!

43:21.200 --> 43:23.600

43:25.000 --> 43:26.200

44:17.400 --> 44:18.800
What do you want?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
It's me, Mark.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.800
I know who it is,
what do you want?

44:23.600 --> 44:25.800
Baby, just let me in will ya.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.200
No Mark, what do you want?

44:30.200 --> 44:31.400
What do you want?

44:31.400 --> 44:32.800
I'm sorry baby.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.800
Yeah, righto.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.600
I don't wanna see you Mark.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.200
I love you baby.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Pull the other fucking one!

44:46.400 --> 44:49.800
- I need to see you Tanya.
- No, i'm no letting you in.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.200
Got that?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.600
- Come on Tanya.
- No, fuck it!

44:56.600 --> 44:59.000
- Just talk.
- Nothing to talk.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Tanya!

45:06.600 --> 45:08.200
I'm going then.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.000
I'm fucking going.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.400
Fucking slut!

45:46.800 --> 45:48.800
- Get out!
- Who are you talking to?

45:51.200 --> 45:53.000
Hello? Is that you Neville?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
You fucking rat!

45:55.800 --> 45:57.000
Tanya, you;re coming with me.

45:57.000 --> 45:57.800
Piss off Mark!

45:57.800 --> 45:59.800
Mark, get out of my house.
Mark, listen to me...

45:59.800 --> 46:04.000
Mum, stay out of it,
i'm not gonna bloody hurt her.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.800
Mark, for goodness dake.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Come here Tanya!

46:18.400 --> 46:19.400
- Why?
- Don't Mark!

46:19.400 --> 46:21.400
Why Neville?

46:22.200 --> 46:23.200
Why Neville?

46:23.600 --> 46:25.200
You ruined everything!

46:25.600 --> 46:26.800
Settle down!

46:29.600 --> 46:32.000
- For God's sake!
- Leave it mum, get out of here!

46:36.600 --> 46:38.200
Now look what you've done!

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Now look what you've gone and done!

46:44.200 --> 46:45.600
My mum's upset.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.000
I'm a bloody
disappointment to you aren't I?

46:59.000 --> 46:59.800
What?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.200
You've probably read all the
newspaper stories about me...

47:04.200 --> 47:07.000
And you've heard the
word on the street about me...

47:07.000 --> 47:10.400
And you've got a picture in your
head of what Chopper Read's like...

47:10.400 --> 47:14.200
And we're sitting here at this
bar all very nice and cosy...

47:14.200 --> 47:16.400
I'm a bit of a bloody let down to you.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.800
What are you on about Mark?

47:22.200 --> 47:25.600
I feel like I should be doing
more for you Mr Downie.

47:25.600 --> 47:29.800
There's crims out there that get
round like a protected species.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.000
Why?

47:32.600 --> 47:34.800
I know you blokes don't mind
turning the occasional blind eye...

47:34.800 --> 47:38.000
whilst I deal out my
own bit of justice, right?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.800
Mark, that's not the way we operate.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.134
I understand perfectly Mr Downie...

47:46.134 --> 47:48.653
there are certain things
you can't appear to condone.

47:48.653 --> 47:51.800
Appearance's got nothing to
do with it. We don't condone it.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.600
I understand Mr Downie.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Who is it?

48:11.600 --> 48:13.200
Nick, go see who it is.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.800
Who there?

48:29.200 --> 48:30.000
It's me.

48:30.600 --> 48:31.800
What the fuck do you want?

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
Is Neville home?

48:35.400 --> 48:36.200
Nev!

48:43.600 --> 48:45.200
What the fuck do you want?

48:45.600 --> 48:47.400
I just came over to apologise.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.800
How the fuck did you
find out where I live?

48:49.800 --> 48:52.200
Don't worry about it, i'm a bit embarrassed about what happened the other night.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.800
I just came over to
apologise and clear it up.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.000
You mad bastard.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.400
You've got a nerve coming around here.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
No fucking about. This is a
very good neighbourhood.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.800
No fucking around.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
You understand?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.600
Open the gates Nev, come on.

49:12.600 --> 49:16.400
I'm gonna let you in... you're
playing the game by my rules.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, it's your house.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.600
It's a lovely house too.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.000
- Full respect mate.
- There'd better be respect

49:23.200 --> 49:24.400
Total respect.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.200
Is that back garage shut Nick?

49:27.200 --> 49:28.400
- Sure?
- Yeah.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Check it out.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.400
- You're bloody killing me.
- How well have I done?

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
Who's the king?

49:36.200 --> 49:37.400
It's very nice.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.800
What are you doing mate throwing
your cigarettes on the grass?

49:39.800 --> 49:42.600
Nick, pick it up, get it off.

49:44.358 --> 49:46.205
What are you guys doing? You're
following me around like a bad smell.

49:46.205 --> 49:47.258
It's like you wanna fuck me up the arse!

49:47.464 --> 49:49.516
Go inside, mix some drinks or
something, get out of here.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.000
It explains your limp.

49:53.600 --> 49:56.000
- Can you dive in?
- No sorry, no grubs allowed.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.400
Have a look at my babies,
are they beautiful or what?

50:00.200 --> 50:02.200
Whatever you do, don't use
the names on those bowls.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.600
They're aliases.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.200
What?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.800
Don't look at me like that,
some smart cunt comes here...

50:09.800 --> 50:13.400
looking to rip me off uses those names
and those dogs will rip him to pieces.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.200
Check this out!

50:20.000 --> 50:20.800
Neville!

50:21.600 --> 50:23.000
Are you bloody right?

50:23.600 --> 50:26.800
I should report you to
the fucking RSPCA you idiot.

50:28.200 --> 50:31.200
No, they like it, they do, my dogs do.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.800
Keeps them alert.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.800
Let's see if those idiots
have got the drinks ready.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.600
Nick?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.600
Neville's turning over
a bit of this stuff is he?

50:49.400 --> 50:52.800
He's got all the spoon
in the western suburbs.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.400
He's doing well then isn't he?

50:57.800 --> 51:00.000
You think he'll want to
give a bit of cash my way?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.800
I don't think he'll go for that.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.200
Fuck him, he'll have to go for it.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
Neville?

51:14.200 --> 51:16.800
Nev, I hear you want
to give me a bit of money.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.600
Where did you hear that mate?

51:19.600 --> 51:22.400
It's just the mail,
I can collect it now if you like.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.600
I think someone's pulling your leg mate.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Someone's pulling your leg Neville.

51:27.210 --> 51:28.955
Someone'll pull your other
fucking leg in a minute.

51:29.156 --> 51:30.357
Now how much do
you wanna give me?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.600
Who do you think you're talking to mate?

51:34.600 --> 51:36.000
I'm Neville Bartos.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.200
Or has your fucking memory
lapsed you fucking idiot?

51:40.000 --> 51:40.800
What?

51:40.800 --> 51:42.600
Who do you think you're talking to mate?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.400
Sorry, was I being rude?

51:44.728 --> 51:47.504
Yes, you were being very
fucking rude, you fucking dickhead.

51:47.504 --> 51:48.891
You wanna make some
money you make it yourself.

51:48.891 --> 51:52.000
Get him a drink Nick.
And behave, I said behave.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.600
Fucking idiot! Can you
believe that fucking cunt or what?

51:59.800 --> 52:02.400
I'm sorry mate, where are you?

52:05.400 --> 52:06.800
I'm sorry mate.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.600
I've had a couple of drinks, I get a bit
carried away, i've just been out of it.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.600
Sorry, give a bit of goey.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.800
I don't know who you think you're talking
to but you're being very rude understand?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.200
Show me some repsect, very very rude.

52:19.200 --> 52:22.800
I'm fucking embarrassed.

52:23.200 --> 52:26.400
I'm fucking sorry Nev. I'm sorry.

52:26.400 --> 52:29.200
Alright mate, apology
accepted, now let it go, relax...

52:29.200 --> 52:31.800
Take it easy, i'm trying to relax over here.

52:38.800 --> 52:43.200
But seriously Nev, how you holding
for cash? I'm a bit bloody broke.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.600
What are you talking about?

52:49.800 --> 52:50.800
Cash.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.600
There's no cash here!

52:54.600 --> 52:58.200
Here there's no cash, alright?
Cash, no, Robbo?

52:58.600 --> 52:59.400
No cash.

53:03.400 --> 53:07.400
I tell you what, you try and get from
where you're sitting to the front door.

53:09.400 --> 53:12.600
Because I reckon I could shoot you from
where you're sitting to the frint door.

53:12.600 --> 53:17.200
Because that's about as long as you've
got to produce some money for me.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.800
I'll give you 20 seconds to produce
some cash of i'll fucking shoot you.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.000
I've got no cash mate...

53:25.000 --> 53:27.600
Jesus, you come here, I give you a
drink, what's that matter with you?

53:27.600 --> 53:29.400
Sit the fuck down!

53:30.400 --> 53:32.200
Listen...

53:32.200 --> 53:35.600
Stop with the fucking cannon,
what are you doing?

53:44.400 --> 53:48.000
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, relax, he's not your enemy!

53:48.000 --> 53:49.400
He fucking is no, isn't he?

53:49.400 --> 53:51.400
Get a fucking rag!

53:51.400 --> 53:54.800
Forget the rag boys,
get the fucking cash will you.

53:57.600 --> 54:01.800
Frozen! How long's it gonna
take to defrost that you idiot?

54:01.800 --> 54:03.600
He's ina  bad way mate.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.000
What's thew matter Neville? You
burst your appendix or something?

54:08.400 --> 54:10.400
Come on Chopper, we've
gotta get him to the hospital.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
So you took him to the hospital?

54:13.200 --> 54:15.800
No I didn't take him to the bloodt hospital.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.800
Now tell me this, why
would I shoot a bloke, bang...

54:18.800 --> 54:22.800
then put him in the car and whizz
him off to the hospital at 100mph?

54:23.200 --> 54:26.000
It defeats the purpose of
shooting him in the first place.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.600
What's more, it's bloody insulting!

54:28.600 --> 54:31.000
Am I the only standover
man in the country...

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
who provides a medical
plan for these customers?

54:34.800 --> 54:37.000
Do I look like Mark Brandon
'Medicare' Read or something?

54:38.400 --> 54:40.600
Who's bloody driving?

54:42.200 --> 54:43.800
Such a bloody sook!

54:43.800 --> 54:46.800
Such a big fuss over such a little
hole. I'll put one in the brain then.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.200
Chopper, come on,
don't do this to your mates!

54:56.581 --> 54:57.672
You're a dead man Chopper.

54:57.672 --> 55:00.430
You're walking around with
one foot in the fucking grave!

55:00.430 --> 55:02.200
Get in you fucking golliwog!

55:05.800 --> 55:07.200
Hospital driver.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.800
He says you took him to the hospital.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.600
You spoken to him have you?

55:18.400 --> 55:20.800
It's just what he's
been saying around town.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.400
You'd do well to have a look at
the motives behind him saying that.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.200
Why would he say it if it's not true?

55:33.400 --> 55:35.800
I don't know, i'm not a
bloody psychiatrist am I?

55:35.800 --> 55:38.800
Look Mark, this is no fucking joke.

55:38.800 --> 55:42.000
I don't fucking appreciate this, we've
heard you've been running around town...

55:42.000 --> 55:45.400
telling all and sundry...

55:45.400 --> 55:48.000
that we've given you virtual
carte blanche to commit crime.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.400
No Mr Downie, that's rubbish,
it's complete fucking bullshit.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.200
Fucking eh it's! bullshit.

55:54.800 --> 55:56.600
You get these fucking
speed freaks together...

55:56.600 --> 55:58.800
they'll create all
kinds of fanciful stories.

55:58.800 --> 56:00.000
Oh yeah?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.800
The other fanciful story is
they've put out a contract on you.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.600
Fucking Mafia, wankers.

56:05.600 --> 56:08.000
Who are they anyway?
Bloody fruit shop owners.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.000
They should stick to selling their
bloody fruit and veg and leave me alone.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.000
I'd be taking this
seriously if I were you.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.800
I'm taking it seriously,
i'm shaking in my boots.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.400
Apparently they're going to
try and get you at Bojangles.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.800
Anastopoulos and Bartos have
gone to Sydney for the weekend.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.600
So obviously they're not fucking around.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.600
They should stay in Sydney
those razzle dazzle wankers.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.400
It'd suit their style.

56:36.400 --> 56:39.000
Anytime you ever see a Sydney
criminal on the television is when...

56:39.800 --> 56:41.000
he's lying in the gutter...

56:41.400 --> 56:44.000
dead after being killed by a
bloody imported Melbourne hitman.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.600
I really think you should
be taking this seriously.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.400
I'm taking it seriously, trust me.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.200
Jimmy Loughnan's name
has also been mentioned.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
Jimmy Loughnan?

56:54.200 --> 56:55.600
He's a fucking couch potato.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.400
It's just what we heard.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.400
Jimmy Loughnan?
Are you sure?

57:01.400 --> 57:02.600
Get the fuck up now!

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Come on!

57:08.000 --> 57:09.400
Oh for fuck sake!

57:09.400 --> 57:12.400
Put the fucking thing away will you.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.200
Put the fucking thing awat!

57:17.600 --> 57:19.600
- Do you want a look?
- No, fuck off!

57:41.600 --> 57:43.600
Get up, get the fucking door!

57:46.200 --> 57:47.600
You're crazy!

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
-Who is it?
- Mark.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.400
Mark who?

57:56.400 --> 57:57.600
Chopper.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.200
What're you doing coming around here?

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
All those problems we've had,
they're all in the past.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.400
And all these rumours that are
flying around, they're all bullshit.

58:15.400 --> 58:17.800
I just wanna come in,
I wanna be friends.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.000
What rumours?

58:19.600 --> 58:21.000
That i'm gonna clip you.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.400
I haven't heard that one.

58:22.400 --> 58:26.200
Well it's not true.
Just let us in will you.

58:27.800 --> 58:30.800
Mate, i'm not letting you in,
i've got kids here.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.800
They're just little kids...

58:31.800 --> 58:35.200
and they'll be afraid by
seeing a man with no ears.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.000
Right.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
It's nothing personal.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.400
No, it's no problem.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.000
Who is it?

58:43.400 --> 58:47.000
Come on Jim, just let us in.
I'll come in and have a chat.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.800
Come on mate!

58:51.000 --> 58:52.600
I don't bloody bite.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
Alright.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.400
Just hang on...

58:59.400 --> 59:00.600
Get out the way!

59:03.200 --> 59:04.200
Are you armed?

59:06.000 --> 59:07.400
Of course i'm bloody armed.

59:07.738 --> 59:09.164
I've got a bunch of
peanuts trying to kill me...

59:09.164 --> 59:10.865
would I get around
without my fucking guns?

59:11.800 --> 59:14.000
Alright, well you throw them in,
you throw them all in or...

59:14.000 --> 59:17.200
I'm not gonna let you in.
Throw them in first.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.800
Alright?

59:32.000 --> 59:34.600
Nice stick, is that it?

59:34.600 --> 59:36.200
No, one more.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.200
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.800
I know you...

59:43.800 --> 59:45.400
Ladies' gun.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.200
Beautiful.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.000
It's a girls' gun but it does the job.

59:53.600 --> 59:56.000
Mark, this is my fiancée, Mandy.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.600
Hello, Mandy.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.000
Fiancée eh?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.000
You'd better speed it up and make
an honest women of her quick...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
The bun's nearly cooked!

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.800
You got your finger in
your mouth there little one.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.000
This is plush mate, this is swank.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.400
Who says crime doesn't pay?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.200
It is a nice gun.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.600
You got yourself a
family now Jim, little girl.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.400
That's lovely mate. I don't reckon
I could ever have a family though.

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:41.036
They're the sort of thing that
could be used against you.

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:42.769
You know what I mean?

01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:46.464
No, not the way that sounded
but you know what I mean.

01:00:46.464 --> 01:00:47.547
You alright there love?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.000
How come he hasn't got any ears?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.200
How come I hasn't got any ears?
You're a cheeky little girl aren't you?

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.600
Mandy, get Shazzy off to bed now!

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.200
Hey, wake up.
Come on twinkletoes, up, let's go!

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.200
- Ye righto.
- It's bedtime.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.800
I don't wanna go to bed.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.000
Not you, Shazzy, it's
Shazzy's bedtime. Put her to bed.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.800
Good on you Shazzy.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.200
Night Shazza.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.400
See ya Shazzy!
Take mummy to bed.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.800
See ya Shazzy!

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.800
Say goodnight to uncle Chop.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.400
Jesus Jim.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.800
You really have landed
on your knees haven't ya?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
What are you doing here?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.400
What? Can't I visit a mate?

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.400
You and I were very best of friends.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.200
I do have a couple of
questions for you though.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.200
I've got a couple of questions.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.200
Now the first question is:

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.200
Is there something you're
supposed to be telling me?

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800
No.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
There's nothing you're
supposed to be telling me?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600
No mate.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400
Eveything that's happened in the past...

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.400
I'll wash it all away, so long as
there's nothing I need to know now.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200
You're not angry at me for anything?

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.600
No, i'm not angry with you,
it's all water under the bridge.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400
No new water, no fresh buckets?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.200
There's no fresh buckets coming round.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.800
Now the second question:

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.000
Are you employed at the moment,
are you gainfully employed?

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.000
I perish the thought.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.400
How much you using?

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400
I've got a handle on it.
It's...

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.000
Fucking H division mate.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.200
The only thing you ever had
a handle on Jimmy Loughnan...

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.800
was the occasional knife handle
when things got a bit too much for you.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400
Knife handling the old Chop Chop.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.800
Jimmy, listen,
i'm gonna show you somthing.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.400
Now if this goes any further,
my life's in danger...

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.600
and you'll be the one
who's getting killed, alright?

01:04:09.074 --> 01:04:11.022
Now have a look at this,
I need someone to help we work.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.050
Guess who i'm working for now?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.800
Bloody guess, have a bloody guess.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800
Fuck, eh...

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.200
Wrong, begins with C.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.200
Amanda Duncan.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.000
- Cops?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.600
I got a fucking green light
from them, have a look at this.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.000
Dirty Dick Downie.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.200
He looks like a fucking
accountant but he's a hard bastard.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.800
Super Steve Cooney,
look out Super Steve.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.400
You heard about
Neville Bartos' burst appendix?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
That was me and the raincoat man.
Downie was driving the car.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.800
You drove him to the hospital.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.400
No I didn't drive
him to the bloody hospital.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.000
Do I look like Mother Teresa to you?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.800
You know him do you?

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.000
Who?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.000
Fucking who? Neville.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.600
What are you doing
standing there sticky nose?

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.200
I fucking live here, you shouldn't
be talking about this stuff here!

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.600
Oh, fucking go and do the dishes!

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.200
Fucking shut up!

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.000
Don't come back in here
when we're talking business!

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Business eh?
I bet you've got a briefcase there.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.000
So there's nothing you're
supposed to be telling me Jim?

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.600
Nothing about a
contract that's out on me?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.000
You must have two
dozen contracts out on you.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.600
Aall apparently Neville Bartos and
Nick Anastopoulos...

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.800
and the rest of the fairy godfathers
have put a contract out on me.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.200
Look mate, I don't
know anything about it.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.400
Really? You see I heard you're
the one who's supposed to do it.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.000
I guess it's a case of first,
best dressed isn't it.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.800
No Mark, you're
being fucking paranoid.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.200
Just because i'm being paranoid doesn't
mean people aren't trying to kill me.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.400
Mark, i've got kids here man.
I've got kids here, alright?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.200
Chop, he really likes you,
he speaks highly of you!

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.000
He wouldn't fucking try and knock you!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.600
Fucking sure he fucking does.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.800
- Well fucking shoot me!
- Don't shoot him...

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.200
- Shoot me in front of my kids!
- Put the gun away Chopper!

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.800
Shoot me in front of my kids!

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.200
Go on you fucking cunt, go on!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400
I'm sorry Jim.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.000
I didn't mean to bloody scare you.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.400
You gotta relax a bit man,
you gotta take it easy.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.600
You gotta get out of town.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.800
- You're jumpy.
- Yeah whatever.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.600
Look at you though, bloody hell!

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.200
You're going bad Jim. You've
got bloody kids and everything.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.200
For Christ's sake.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.200
Fix your house up, fix you're bloody
kids up, get your life in order.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.400
You can't live like this,
it's bloody terrible, take it.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.200
Jim, mother's a
drug addict for fuck sake!

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.000
That's not for drugs.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Jim, don't slam the fucking door!
The kids are asleep.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.400
At least they were.
Who you ringing?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.000
Get dressed, we're going out.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.800
Get dressed? We've got no money.
Where we going?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.600
Just get dressed, we're going out, ok?
Get me my gun, get me my jacket, quick.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.800
Jesus, where we going?

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.800
It's 1 o'clock, it
better be fucking good.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.000
Neville.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.000
It's Loughnan.
Yeah, he's just been here.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.800
- Has he?
- Just left my place.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.000
- Where's he fucking going?
- He's going to Bojangles.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.800
Bojangles, great job,
i'll get my jacket.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.200
Fuck Neville Bartos!

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.000
He couldn't have the fluff
to knock off a cappuccino.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.000
He's saying that you're two-faced.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.000
I'm not bloody two-faced!

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.600
The word is and i'm hearing it everywhere
is that you're working for the cops.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.000
Who says that?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.399
I'm hearing it everywhere.

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:34.036
You gotta look at the motives behind
the people saying this stuff.

01:08:34.602 --> 01:08:35.734
I'm not well liked Ian.

01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:38.676
Do you realise it's the world's
worst best kept secret that...

01:08:38.676 --> 01:08:40.301
i've giving you me
and it bloody information?

01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:42.800
Do you think there are sharks running
around telling people about this stuff?

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.600
That'd be sort of counter-productive.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.000
I like a smiling face Mr Downie
and you know I like you...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.399
but i'm an expert at playing mind
games, i'll set my little traps...

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.800
and i'll find out where
the leak is coming from.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.800
It's good to see you my friend.
Do you want a drink?

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.399
No, no, that's alright mate.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.200
Let me buy you drink,
I have plenty money...

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.000
I buy you two dozen drink.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.800
- Later, alright?
- You won't forget?

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.200
- Thanks. - You want
drink you come see me.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Who's that?

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.399
Who?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
The fucking wog
character up at the bar.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.399
That's Sammy the Turk.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:30.399
Really?

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:36.800
You wanna know
if she's got friends?

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:42.200
What are you touching for me
all the time? You bloody homosexual?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.399
Why you scared?

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.399
I'm not scared just don't
touch me you bloody poofta.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.200
- Where's your car?
- It's up there!

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.399
Which one?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.600
- Keep going.
- Where?

01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.600
Is that gun eh?

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.000
Yeah it's a gun, it's pointed at you.
Now, who's team are you on?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.400
What?

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.800
Who's team are you on?

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.000
Team, football?

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.200
Fucking comedian too are you?

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.400
Why'd you fucking bring me out here?

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600
What?

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.400
No no Chop...
you bring me here.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.200
You're fucking good aren't you?

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.200
Yes i'm good, i'm friend to you.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.203
Yeah you're a
fucking friend aren't ya?

01:10:34.512 --> 01:10:36.572
Bringing me out here in the middle
of the fucking night, what for?

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.200
What?

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200
What's that mean?

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800
You want English?

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.400
Speak fucking English!
It's Australia!

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
Fuck you!
That's English.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800
You alright?

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.200
Give me a look.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.200
You alright? I'm sorry mate.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Jimmy!

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.800
That fucking lunatic just shot a bloke,
he just shot him in the eye!

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.200
Don't shout my name!

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.200
Who's this bloke?

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.600
I don't know, shut the fuck up Marcus!
I never liked you, let me in the car!

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.000
Calm down!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.600
Who's this bloke?

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.600
Let me get in.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.400
Calm down!

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.800
Now this character, he's
following me around all night...

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.600
he's got his arm around me all night,
he's buying me drinks, buying me drinks...

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.800
buying me drinks, in my company,
right here, all frickin' night.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.400
I didn't know him, I didn't
know him from a bar of soap.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.400
You know me, I don't go out my
way to befriend our ethnic cousins.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.400
He's Turkish or something, i've
got enough on my plate as it is.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.000
Yeah, go on.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.200
He wants to sell me this gun.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.000
He says he's got all
these guns in the car outside.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.600
Well I didn't have 10 cents on me.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.600
But I don't think he had a
gun salesmen's license either.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.800
I thought if he wants to sell
me a gun i'll relieve him of it.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.400
He's very keen to get me
into this carpark mind you.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.400
So did you go outside with him?

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.400
What happened was we go to the carpark...

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.800
Bojangles has got two carparks...

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.200
I head to the main carpark and...

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.200
he pulls me up, he says:

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.200
No Chopper, this way,
this way over here...

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.600
I park over here, on this side.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.400
Plenty guns, very good guns.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.600
I get a bit bloody suspicious because...

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.400
this carpark is not very well
lit, it's pitch bloody black...

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.400
and I walk out there, i'm
following him, and he stops dead...

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.000
and he turns around...

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.200
and he's looking
over my bloody shoulder.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.200
This fucking prick is
checking for bloody witnesses.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.800
All of a sudden he
turns around, he says:

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400
Hey, wait, Chopper, you got gun?

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.000
He's walking towards me. "You got gun?"

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.200
I said yeah, I got a gun.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.400
He says:

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.600
What sort? Show me please.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.000
"Show me your fucking gun."
He's dying to see my bloody gun.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.000
I had the gun down the front of my
pants, so i've lifted up my jacket...

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.200
i've looked down at my gun and
this cheeky little fucking rat...

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.200
he's grabbed the gun as quick
as lightning, he's pulled it out...

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.400
and he pointed it at
my head and he's gone...

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.200
Click click click with the trigger.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.400
It's not going off.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.000
It's a 32 automatic.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.800
Now as you fellas know, unless
you've got the hammer pulled back...

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.200
It's not gonna go off, it's an operative.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.600
You can pull the trigger all bloody
day long and it's not gonna go off.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.600
Yeah sure so...

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.200
What happened then?

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.600
So he's got the gun at my
head, he's going click click click...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.600
and I have got the 410 shotgun down
the back of my pants, so I pull it out.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.000
It's a tiny little bloody 410 shotgun...

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.800
He's going click click click...

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.800
I'm thinking to myself, shit, it's only
gonna take him a couple of seconds...

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.000
to work this thing out
with the hammer so...

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.600
i've pulled out the bllody 410 and...

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.400
I just go fucking bang.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.800
And that was it.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.400
He just bloody fell over.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.000
Mark, what game are you playing?
Is this another one of your traps?

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.200
What do you mean?

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.600
Are you testing us?
Do you wanna see if...

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.800
we're gonna rush off to the
homicide squad and dob you in?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.200
What?

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.600
We know you didn't shoot the Turk.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.400
I just told you I shot the Turk.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.400
They picked up the bloke that did it.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.600
What fucking bloke
that did it? I did it.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.400
No, homicide have picked up the guy.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.800
- They've even got the murder weapon.
- What murder weapon?

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.600
A 410 shotgun.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.600
This bloody 410 shotgun.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.000
Put it away Mark, just put it away.
This thing, it's a 410...

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
fine, it's a 410, there's a
fucking million 410s out there.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.000
That's not the 410 that did it.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.800
You don't want this?
It's a murder weapon!

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.200
Put the gun away.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.200
Take it down to bloody forensic.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.200
How long have you
been on the go mate?

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.400
On the go mate? The only 
person on the go here is you.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.000
The fucking goey mate, where's the 
crust mate? You're off you're dial.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.400
I don't think i've ever been as 
bloody insulted as I am right now.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.000
I'm sitting here confessing 
to a fucking murder...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
i've known you since 
I was a fucking pup...

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.200
and you've got the fucking 
audacity to drag this cunt here...

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.600
Sort out you're boy would you.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.200
and you look at me 
like i'm a fucking idiot.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.200
You're a bullshitter, simple.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.000
I just saw on the TV a 
man was shot at Bojangles .

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.600
I thought it was you.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.600
Well it couldn't be me could it 
or else I wouldn't be standing here.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.200
Used to be bloody Chopper Read...

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.200
Now I can't even get 
arrested in this fucking town.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.600
Did you do that?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Would I do a thing like that?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.400
That's my boy, one in the skull!

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.200
It took those numbskulls two 
weeks to finally get around to...

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.800
sorting the whole 
mess out and arresting me.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.600
Turns out Mandy Carroll was there that night.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.200
Followed me and Sammy out to 
the carpark and saw the whole thing.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.000
What I seen when the 
man got shot was like...

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.200
a flash from the 
side of his face like...

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.600
yellow colours.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.000
You know when you fire a 
gun and you see the flashes.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.400
Did you see a gun in 
the Turkish man's hands?

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:49.537
The Turk was just standing there, 
he didn't have anything in his hands...

01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:50.769
he didn't have a gun, nothing.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.400
He was just copping at sweet.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.400
"Copping at sweet."

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
She turned crown witness against me...

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.200
Claimed that I murdered 
the Turk in cold blood.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.400
But what was she doing, 
8 months pregnant...

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.000
bloody stoned off her tits...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.600
down at Bojangles at 6 in the morning?

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.000
Jimmy and the boys will be in the car.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.600
You help setup the big 
fella, it'll make you a star.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.600
They said they had it farmed out,
They had it ghosted,

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.000
But when I walked out the door,
They just left me posted.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.200
The game was for real,
It was no lark,

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.000
But the twit took him out
to the wrong carpark.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.400
Siily boys, that's all 
that Chopper had to say,

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.400
And poor little Sammy got blown away.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.400
The knuckleheads! I could've 
shot them in both kneecaps...

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.800
and finished a game of cards...

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.800
before this crew of 
retards got their act together.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.800
I'd like to thank my legal 
team for all their hard work.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.000
Solicitor Mr Pat Hutton, 
my barrister Mr Morris Jeffery...

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.800
and queen's council Mr Damien Collins.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:07.303
It was their sterling, bloody sterling 
legal work that helped me beat the rap.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:08.430
I'm just bloody rapt.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.600
I beat the murder Blue on 
the grounds of self defence...

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.600
but I got 5 years 
for malicious wounding...

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.800
and other assorted scallywag behaviour.

01:20:28.396 --> 01:20:32.142
I don't wanna put shit on myself but
the shooting of Sammy the Turk...

01:20:32.393 --> 01:20:33.534
at Bojangles nightclub...

01:20:33.734 --> 01:20:39.124
is the most shitpot non-event murder 
case in Australian criminal history.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.000
But for some reason I get all 
these letter from all over the world...

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.800
and photos where all these crackpots 
have gone down and taken photos.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.600
I've got a letter here from the 
sheriff of Sparkes county, Nevada...

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.400
wishing I was there.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.200
And have a look, for some reason 
they go down and take photos.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.200
Bloody South African backpackers...

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.800
Bloody funny-looking homosexual...

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.200
How did he end up in there?

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.800
Housewives...

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.600
Bloody nitwits, these 
young criminal wannabes...

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.800
spunky ladies with lingerie...

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.000
It's unbelievable. 
I guess it's old Chop Chop...

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.800
doing his bit for tourism Victoria.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.000
She's alright Chopper.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.400
She's behind the letter 
writing protest to the governer.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.400
Isn't she boss?

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.200
She'd be writing a few letters of 
protest if I ever got my hands on her.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.200
Oh really Bucky? Can I 
introduce you to a friend of mine?

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.600
Get the camera over to Bucky.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.800
Bucky, get over here.
Here he is, young Bucky.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.800
Show her tatto Buck. Hoik it up!

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.800
"King Kong" and why's he got that?
Voila! Copycat!

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.400
Isn't that bloody pathetic?

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.000
If you wanna be like 
your uncle Chop Chop...

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
get them ears chopped off! Now get 
outta here, they're interested in me.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.800
Go on piss off, get out!

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.000
Get the bloody camera...
Don't worry about Bucky.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.400
What is this? 
I haven't got all day!

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.800
Continue! Roll along.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.000
So, how would you 
describe yourself now?

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.800
Just a bloke.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Just a good bloke down on his luck.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.400
You don't seem out of luck to me.
You've written a best-seller.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.400
Yeah I know... 
and I can't even bloody spell.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.400
What about those poor bloody 
academics, those college graduates...

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.800
battling their guts out to 
write some airy-fairy piece of...

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.800
exaggerated artwork.
And there's a bloke, 

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.200
sitting in a cell, who can't spell, 
and he's written a best-seller.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.600
It's sold 250,000 copies. 
And it's still selling

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.400
And he's writing another one!
And I can't even spell!

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400
I'm semi-bloody-illiterate.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.200
They must hate my guts eh?

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.200
- Have you got all your stuff?
- Yeah.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.800
So what do you reckon?
We entering Logie country or what?

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.600
Jana Wendt look out!

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.000
We can send you a 
rough cut before we go to air.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
No, that's alright. Anything I say 
would just be bloody fiddling anyway.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.600
I'm sure i'll be very happy with it, 
i'm sure it'll be exactly what I want.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600
Absolutely.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.000
It'll be very good won't it?

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:29.289
He is Australia's most feared criminal. 
Self-styled crime commando who...

01:23:29.513 --> 01:23:33.119
terrorised, tortured and murdered 
dozens of drug dealers and armed robbers

01:23:33.119 --> 01:23:34.305
on the streets of Melbourne.

01:23:34.544 --> 01:23:37.135
He is, of course, 
Mark Brandon "Chopper" Read.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.800
He is also a best-selling author.

01:23:40.321 --> 01:23:43.683
- And I can't even bloody spell!
- ...this exclusive interview.

01:23:44.292 --> 01:23:46.709
Mark Read says he's 
committed 19 murders...

01:23:47.073 --> 01:23:50.864
but he's only ever been charged 
with one and he was acquitted of that.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.000
Nevertheless, he's much 
of his adult life behind bars...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.400
the rest on the street disposing of...

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.000
what he calls, "Human Filth".

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.200
Did you really cut people's toes off?

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.800
My word, yeah.

01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:07.487
You see to it with the bolt cutters 
they come to it every time.

01:24:08.641 --> 01:24:10.865
- They love it.
- They love it?

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.400
Well they don't like it, 
they scream a lot, but I liked it.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.400
Yeah, I like cutting off their toes.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.400
What did you like about it?

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.400
You know, 
the way these just... pop off.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.600
You've got the money...

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.800
and you're going to kill them, so 
when do these good manners kick in?

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.400
- Work it out! - ...break the news 
to them that their number's up?

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.000
You say "Look, you've given me you're 
money, you've been a good sport...

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.400
I do apologise but i'm 
gonna have to kill you. "

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.800
You don't really do all that stuff?

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800
What?

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.600
All that stuff you're saying on TV.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.000
You know me, never let the truth 
get in the way of a good yarn.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.600
Come and have a look one day.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.200
I fancy the 10 toes 
that i've got, i'll keep them.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.200
- You've got a nice foot.
- Thanks.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.800
Unbelievable, smiling your little 
pearly teeth at her, she's loving it.

01:25:07.458 --> 01:25:09.441
Rene Brach with that report from Pentridge.

01:25:09.868 --> 01:25:12.757
I get the feeling that that's not the 
last we'll be hearing from Mark Read.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.993
Too bloody right!

01:25:13.738 --> 01:25:16.574
I must point out that Chopper Read 
was not paid for that interview.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
This programme does not pay criminals.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.200
Bring it! Give us more! 
Where you going?

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.400
What's going on here?
Is that it?

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.565
How much do you want mate?

01:25:31.565 --> 01:25:34.382
Jeses Christ, it's a television 
station, they gotta sell stuff.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.000
Brilliant bloody publicity if you ask me.
What's that gotta be worth to me?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Worth anything mate, worth anything.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.400
Who needs to be bloody 
paid when you get on...

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.600
that's bloody prime time 
this time of the night.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.600
I come acroos alright didn't I?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.200
I reckon I come across intelligent...

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.400
but tough.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Come on, we've got 
some work to do mate.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.400
You alright for ciggies mate?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.800
Yeah i've got.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.400
- Sweet, sure?
- Yeah.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400
Catch you later.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.000
I'm gonna have to 
shut this door Mark.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.600
That's alright, I know.
