01:04.357 --> 01:06.192
She says it is the work...

01:06.275 --> 01:08.111
of the barbarian devil king.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.743
Her village

01:15.826 --> 01:19.247
was loyal to the rebel Song dynasty.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.790
If one does not submit
to the rule of the Khan...

01:21.874 --> 01:24.543
this is what happens.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.067
Gerege!

04:17.925 --> 04:19.593
The Latins.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.845
Yes, I remember.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.432
But where are the Christian
priests you were to bring, hmm?

04:25.349 --> 04:28.727
Lord Kublai... please accept our remorse.

04:28.811 --> 04:32.273
Our priests could not bear
the rigors of the journey.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.984
But we did bring you holy oil from...

04:36.068 --> 04:39.780
Your men of God retreat,
but this boy advances.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.240
It says very little for your savior. Hmm?

04:44.535 --> 04:48.997
Loyalty... of a mortal son to
a mortal father, Great Khan.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.207
Hmm.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.085
Holy oil

04:53.168 --> 04:55.003
from the pontiff who wishes to spread

04:55.087 --> 04:57.840
Christianity throughout my lands.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.802
Is this not the same Pope who has
called me "the spawn of Satan"?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.014
I will say this and you will listen.

05:06.098 --> 05:09.893
Christianity is welcome in my kingdom.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.520
As is Buddhism...

05:11.604 --> 05:15.190
Judaism... Islam...

05:15.273 --> 05:19.945
and the Eternal Blue Sky of
my grandfather, Genghis Khan,

05:20.028 --> 05:22.615
descended from a wolf.

05:34.460 --> 05:39.172
So, tell your Pope that he
himself must bow before me...

05:39.256 --> 05:41.550
and pledge his fealty to me.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.802
As for you merchants...

05:43.886 --> 05:47.055
you crossed ocean and mountain...

05:47.139 --> 05:50.100
the great Takla Makan Desert.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.310
One not many men survive.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.774
Describe for me my desert, hmm?

06:00.277 --> 06:01.779
It is a...

06:01.862 --> 06:05.073
most barren region, Sire.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.619
No water. No life, Lord Khan.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.623
- Not even a bird.
- Not even a bird.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.834
It is, Great Khan... a sea of death.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.298
Yet very much alive.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.301
At night you hear it.

06:25.594 --> 06:29.432
The shifting sands, they... sing.

06:29.515 --> 06:30.641
Humble apologies, Sire.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.519
He does not yet know the rules of the...

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
Continue.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.153
Voices like... spirits...

06:44.279 --> 06:47.032
trying to lure you off course.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.035
This is why men die out there.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.788
The Uighurs called it...

06:55.666 --> 06:58.043
You learned the tongue of the Uighurs?

06:58.126 --> 07:01.129
Three years was not long
enough to learn it all.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.855
Of all the lands a
traveler passes through...

07:17.938 --> 07:20.190
which province contains...

07:20.273 --> 07:23.151
in your eye, the most
beautiful women of all?

07:29.366 --> 07:32.327
I find that all women, no
matter from which land...

07:32.410 --> 07:35.163
they are all beautiful in
their own unique manner.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.000
In Italy, we have a saying...

07:42.963 --> 07:45.499
"The true sweetness of wine...

07:45.783 --> 07:47.511
is one flavor."

07:58.382 --> 08:00.050
You have a clever mind.

08:00.801 --> 08:03.053
For a Latin.

08:03.136 --> 08:05.973
I made one request. It was not for oil.

08:06.056 --> 08:09.393
It was for priests. With this, you failed.

08:09.477 --> 08:10.603
Take your leave.

08:10.686 --> 08:12.563
Go, Latins.

08:12.646 --> 08:14.815
You're banished forever.

08:18.652 --> 08:22.030
You are most correct, Lord Khan.

08:22.114 --> 08:23.991
The boy...

08:24.074 --> 08:27.411
has a clever mind and...
excellent perception.

08:29.413 --> 08:30.873
He is my son...

08:33.125 --> 08:34.751
and most dear to me.

08:36.544 --> 08:40.090
But if it pleases Your Greatness, you
may take him as your man and servant.

08:42.635 --> 08:44.387
What do you wish in return?

08:44.470 --> 08:47.723
The opportunity to pay tribute
to my Khan from my journeys...

08:47.806 --> 08:49.683
along the Silk Road.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.309
Father, what are you doing?

08:51.394 --> 08:54.062
Marco, trust this. Be silent.

08:54.146 --> 08:56.482
- I am your son.
- Be silent.

08:56.565 --> 09:00.653
You wish not the honor of service
in the court of the Khan of Khans?

09:03.656 --> 09:08.243
What greater tribute can a man offer
than his own flesh and his own blood?

09:10.328 --> 09:13.541
You Latin merchants may engage
in trade along my Silk Road.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.543
Ahmad, my Minister of Finance,

09:15.626 --> 09:17.670
will discuss taxation and transit.

09:17.753 --> 09:19.337
Take your leave.

09:20.714 --> 09:22.383
- Marco, you have to trust me.
- Father!

09:22.466 --> 09:24.259
- This will not be forever.
- Don't do this.

09:24.342 --> 09:27.846
We will secure the trade
routes and be back for you.

09:30.974 --> 09:33.310
And I still want those priests.

09:34.728 --> 09:36.564
Father! Don't leave me here.

13:20.620 --> 13:23.206
Of all the things I
expected to come home to

13:23.290 --> 13:24.667
after all these years...

13:26.710 --> 13:30.047
"Marco." She gave you a fine name.

13:35.427 --> 13:36.679
When did she pass?

13:40.015 --> 13:41.516
I was six.

13:52.027 --> 13:53.195
From Jerusalem.

13:54.112 --> 13:56.824
It has guarded my heart for 14 years.

14:01.119 --> 14:03.080
Psalms 72:11.

14:03.163 --> 14:06.333
"All kings shall fall before him."

14:14.382 --> 14:16.969
- Where were you?
- The Silk Road.

14:18.095 --> 14:19.554
It ends here in Venezia.

14:19.637 --> 14:22.557
It stretches 4,000 miles across the world.

14:23.684 --> 14:27.062
Why did you never send word to Mother?

14:29.147 --> 14:31.149
It is not simple.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.777
We had an arrangement.

14:33.861 --> 14:37.906
But had I any idea of the birth of a son...

14:43.120 --> 14:44.830
You have her eyes.

14:47.791 --> 14:49.960
Well, now...

14:50.043 --> 14:52.004
your Uncle Maffeo and I...

14:52.087 --> 14:53.922
we have important business
to discuss with the Bishop

14:54.006 --> 14:55.966
before we set sail again.

14:56.049 --> 14:58.385
I will travel with you.

15:01.304 --> 15:05.350
Father. Do not leave me alone again.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.894
This is not possible.

15:09.021 --> 15:12.357
You are not prepared for the
rigors of the journey ahead.

16:08.163 --> 16:10.958
Lord, help us!

16:11.041 --> 16:12.876
Lord, help us!

16:12.960 --> 16:14.544
Get over there!

16:16.046 --> 16:17.755
I can help!

16:19.007 --> 16:21.343
You defied me, boy!

16:21.426 --> 16:24.471
You do not belong here! Stay away from me!

16:43.406 --> 16:44.908
No, no, no.

16:49.287 --> 16:50.288
Very good.

16:51.706 --> 16:55.210
This is not what we imagined.
We must return to our flock.

16:55.293 --> 16:57.462
You are not abandoning our factor.

16:57.545 --> 16:59.131
Your Bishop gave you orders.

16:59.214 --> 17:01.008
Then follow us back to Venice...

17:01.091 --> 17:02.717
and bring the Bishop instead.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.262
Uncle, Uncle, these are men of God.

17:07.305 --> 17:09.516
- Godspeed.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:15.313 --> 17:17.023
Enough!

17:17.107 --> 17:20.693
You have no knowledge of our
world! Do not act as if you do!

17:25.991 --> 17:27.034
Take your donkey.

17:27.117 --> 17:29.494
Follow the priests back to the ship.

17:30.453 --> 17:31.663
Go home.

18:05.155 --> 18:06.198
Marco!

18:08.783 --> 18:09.910
Marco!

18:18.751 --> 18:20.628
We have lost three days.

18:20.712 --> 18:22.297
We haven't lost a thing, Maffeo.

18:22.380 --> 18:25.133
The Khan and our trade routes slip away

18:25.217 --> 18:28.053
while you make amends
for your fatherly sins.

18:28.136 --> 18:30.305
He is our blood.

18:30.388 --> 18:31.473
Mark my words.

18:31.556 --> 18:34.601
He will gut the foundation of
everything we have labored to build.

18:35.727 --> 18:37.479
- Get out.
- What?

18:37.562 --> 18:39.481
Get out.

20:22.959 --> 20:23.960
Run!

20:24.044 --> 20:25.545
- Take cover!
- Everyone, run!

20:25.628 --> 20:27.797
Run! Go!

20:28.965 --> 20:30.300
Go! Run!

20:33.470 --> 20:35.055
Take cover!

20:35.138 --> 20:37.307
Move! Move! Move!

21:08.380 --> 21:09.797
Were you frightened earlier?

21:11.299 --> 21:13.135
I was not.

21:14.511 --> 21:17.847
I was terrified the first time I left home.

21:19.932 --> 21:23.395
Venezia was all I had ever known.

21:23.478 --> 21:25.480
Do you know how I persevered?

21:28.191 --> 21:31.403
Knowing just where home was...

21:31.486 --> 21:34.364
and that I could always return to it.

21:40.162 --> 21:42.414
Do you see those stars there?

21:44.707 --> 21:47.585
The Three Sisters.

21:49.587 --> 21:52.257
The Three Sisters.

21:58.346 --> 22:00.390
If you are ever afraid...

22:02.225 --> 22:04.519
if ever you doubt your
place in the world...

22:07.230 --> 22:10.775
follow The Three Sisters
and they will lead you home.

22:17.073 --> 22:18.283
My only fear...

22:19.367 --> 22:21.994
is that I might awaken in my bed...

22:22.078 --> 22:25.582
destined to live a common life once again.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.711
The blood of an adventurer
courses through your veins.

22:29.794 --> 22:31.671
I can see this.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.263
You will enjoy the
greatest adventure of all.

22:41.514 --> 22:42.515
You will meet...

22:42.599 --> 22:45.560
the richest...

22:45.643 --> 22:50.106
most powerful king on
the face of this earth.

22:51.148 --> 22:54.277
The Great Kublai Khan.

23:16.215 --> 23:18.009
The Song rebels of Xiangyang...

23:18.092 --> 23:22.096
can no longer cast aside
our dominion with impunity.

23:22.179 --> 23:26.601
As my trusted advisors,
I seek your counsel.

23:26.684 --> 23:28.395
Jingim.

23:31.606 --> 23:33.441
You will one day sit here where I do now.

23:33.525 --> 23:36.778
Speak to your uncles and
cousins who have traveled far.

23:39.781 --> 23:43.451
Destroying the Song dynasty rebels is wise.

23:43.535 --> 23:46.413
But is it not wiser to let them
remain in their Walled City...

23:46.496 --> 23:49.291
paying us tribute?

23:49.374 --> 23:52.877
What does my vice regent,
Yusuf, say on this matter?

23:54.421 --> 23:56.172
Prince Jingim is correct.

23:57.757 --> 24:00.677
North China already adores Lord Kublai.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.846
Let South China remain
within their Walled City.

24:04.889 --> 24:06.265
Treat the rebels as a...

24:06.349 --> 24:08.935
cow that we draw milk from...

24:09.018 --> 24:13.064
rather than slaughtering the
cow, and receiving no milk.

24:14.065 --> 24:15.274
Or silk...

24:15.358 --> 24:16.984
in this case.

24:21.197 --> 24:24.909
The Walled City of Xiangyang...
guards the Yangtze River.

24:24.992 --> 24:27.495
And the Yangtze is the
gateway to all China.

24:27.579 --> 24:30.081
You are the Great Khan of Khans.

24:30.164 --> 24:35.211
You desire a unified China. It
should be yours no matter the cost.

24:35.294 --> 24:37.339
The Minister of Finance speaks well.

24:38.381 --> 24:40.299
But this is a matter
of security and defense,

24:40.383 --> 24:42.469
not coin and commerce.

24:42.552 --> 24:44.346
Hmm...

24:48.683 --> 24:51.018
Little brother...

24:51.102 --> 24:52.687
Ariq the Strong.

24:53.938 --> 24:56.441
How are things in Karakorum?

24:56.524 --> 24:57.775
Things in the Old Capital

24:57.859 --> 25:00.903
are just as our grandfather,
Genghis, would have them.

25:00.987 --> 25:02.029
Hmm.

25:02.113 --> 25:03.906
But there are some in Karakorum who fear

25:03.990 --> 25:08.411
that our Khan is becoming too
Chinese... too cultured in his ways.

25:11.414 --> 25:12.540
Lord Khan...

25:13.541 --> 25:16.794
may your western cousins from
the House of ÃgÃ♪dei speak?

25:19.714 --> 25:22.925
Does the Great Khan desire
to be Emperor of Mongolia...

25:24.469 --> 25:26.012
or Emperor of China?

25:36.648 --> 25:38.190
Cousin Kaidu...

25:40.568 --> 25:43.738
you forget the mandate
Grandfather was handed from heaven.

25:44.906 --> 25:48.535
To erase dividing lines
from country to country.

25:48.618 --> 25:51.579
A mandate to spread our customs...

25:51.663 --> 25:54.999
our cultures... our very way of life...

25:55.082 --> 25:57.752
to every corner beneath the Blue Sky.

25:58.753 --> 26:02.757
Only one thing stood in his
way, as it now stands in mine.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.386
Xiangyang... the Walled City.

26:07.470 --> 26:09.931
I have already sent
troops into South China.

26:10.014 --> 26:12.016
They are amassing at this very moment.

26:12.099 --> 26:16.103
My spies tell me that in order
to starve the rebels out...

26:16.187 --> 26:19.524
we must cut them off from the
farming village of Wuchang.

26:19.607 --> 26:23.445
I am sending horse
soldiers to that position.

26:23.528 --> 26:24.737
Jingim...

26:25.697 --> 26:28.533
blood of my blood, will
lead the assault on Wuchang.

26:28.616 --> 26:29.701
Jingim...

26:29.784 --> 26:32.369
educated in Chinese ways.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.582
Who better to lead an
attack on the Chinese?

26:36.499 --> 26:38.460
Older brother...

26:38.543 --> 26:42.797
if this is a call to war...
you will have my horse and bow.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.967
I will lead our Golden
Horde down from the north...

26:46.050 --> 26:48.678
and into battle with my nephew.

26:48.761 --> 26:52.640
We will crush Wuchang,
then take the Walled City.

26:54.016 --> 26:56.060
And by the blood of Genghis...

26:56.143 --> 27:00.523
I will cut their leader's head off
and tie it to the mane of my horse!

27:03.776 --> 27:05.737
Emperor of China?

27:07.113 --> 27:08.405
Emperor of Mongolia?

27:09.532 --> 27:11.200
I will be Emperor of the World!

27:42.106 --> 27:44.066
Empress Dowager.

27:46.110 --> 27:47.194
Rise.

27:49.488 --> 27:52.116
How may the Chancellor ease your pain?

27:52.199 --> 27:55.745
Tell me the barbarians are
no longer marching toward us.

27:56.913 --> 27:59.541
I will not lie. The Khan's troops advance.

28:00.332 --> 28:02.168
But upon the soul of our Emperor...

28:02.251 --> 28:04.796
I promise, they will never succeed.

28:08.382 --> 28:11.052
Long live Song empire.

28:20.687 --> 28:25.024
My mantis is great. Do you see?

28:25.107 --> 28:29.821
He feigns inferiority to
encourage his opponent's advance.

28:31.656 --> 28:33.616
I paid a visit to the Emperor's bedside.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.159
How is he?

28:35.242 --> 28:37.203
Quite unwell.

28:39.038 --> 28:43.167
His legacy will live on within these walls.

28:43.250 --> 28:47.254
It will be a sad day... but much
more efficient once he's gone.

28:48.505 --> 28:51.383
No more mixed messages from
an old king to his people.

28:51.467 --> 28:54.762
I will give all orders and
all orders will be followed.

28:54.846 --> 28:57.389
Yes, my Chancellor.

28:57.473 --> 29:00.392
And that goes for the Emperor's
favorite royal concubine.

29:01.644 --> 29:03.145
Where is your sister?

29:03.229 --> 29:05.690
Doing that for which she is famous.

29:05.773 --> 29:10.027
Improving diplomatic ties
with the Governor of Suzhou.

29:14.156 --> 29:15.992
Do you know this game?

29:18.620 --> 29:22.539
How much did you pay my
brother for this opportunity?

29:22.624 --> 29:26.335
More porcelain than he's ever seen.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.262
Do not fear, Governor.

29:37.054 --> 29:39.766
This is part of the game you paid for.

29:39.849 --> 29:43.477
The Danger Game.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.605
You...

29:45.688 --> 29:49.441
are but a lowly... worm.

30:30.482 --> 30:31.693
Come.

31:00.012 --> 31:02.514
You have questions.

31:02.598 --> 31:04.058
Just one.

31:04.141 --> 31:06.560
Am I a privileged guest
or a prisoner in this hell?

31:07.937 --> 31:09.355
A fiery one.

31:09.438 --> 31:13.192
No wonder the Khan caged you
for his own personal amusement.

31:17.279 --> 31:18.405
You're blind.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.325
Not as blind as you, boy.

31:30.793 --> 31:32.461
No roots.

31:35.214 --> 31:37.133
You have spirit, Latin.

31:37.216 --> 31:40.219
Of the Yin and the Yang, you
have an abundance of Yang.

31:41.137 --> 31:43.264
But without Yin, Yang
dies on the battlefield.

31:44.431 --> 31:46.600
We are all prisoners here.

31:46.683 --> 31:50.772
Prisoners and privileged
guests. One and the same.

31:51.856 --> 31:55.192
If you are unable to protect
yourself in the kingdom...

31:55.276 --> 31:58.070
it is I... who will be killed.

31:59.696 --> 32:01.407
Do you understand?

32:02.658 --> 32:05.452
Good. We begin with roots.

32:10.541 --> 32:14.796
You have been conscripted
into the court of Kublai Khan.

32:14.879 --> 32:16.505
For what? I do not know.

32:17.589 --> 32:19.466
I am Hundred Eyes.

32:19.550 --> 32:23.179
I am kept here to train the
Khan's sons... his nobles...

32:24.346 --> 32:26.015
his pets.

32:27.433 --> 32:30.561
You shall be tutored in the
Mongolian ways of the horse.

32:36.692 --> 32:39.153
You shall be tutored in the
great arts of the East...

32:39.236 --> 32:43.574
by those scholars and
artisans loyal to Lord Kublai.

32:44.491 --> 32:46.828
Languages and letters.

32:46.911 --> 32:49.371
Hawking and archery.

32:49.455 --> 32:54.335
And in the end... you may discover
the answer to your question.

33:32.373 --> 33:35.001
A man found in possession
of a stolen horse...

33:35.084 --> 33:39.296
must return it to its owner,
add nine horses of the same kind.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.757
If he is unable to pay this fine...

33:41.841 --> 33:44.676
his children must be taken
instead of the horses.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.595
If he has no children...

33:46.678 --> 33:49.056
then he must be slaughtered like a sheep.

33:49.140 --> 33:51.475
That man has no children.

33:53.310 --> 33:57.773
I hear from my Minister of Falconry,
you have taken well to the hawks.

33:57.857 --> 33:59.691
Archery is improving, yes?

33:59.775 --> 34:01.818
Yes, Great Khan.

34:01.903 --> 34:06.657
I, myself, was always a bit clumsy
with the making of Chinese characters.

34:08.659 --> 34:11.203
When you and your father
crossed Central Asia...

34:11.286 --> 34:12.914
you passed through BadakhshÄn.

34:12.996 --> 34:16.750
Describe for me, in the way that you do...

34:16.833 --> 34:20.254
how you made the passage, what you saw.

34:21.672 --> 34:22.965
We saw sand.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.342
Rode beasts.

34:28.219 --> 34:29.638
Do you defy me?

34:31.139 --> 34:33.684
Describe for me the land of BadakhshÄn.

34:34.851 --> 34:37.521
The footing was hard on our beasts.

34:37.603 --> 34:38.772
The sun very hot.

34:38.855 --> 34:42.068
Take him to the horse grounds. Stuff
his mouth with the shit of pigs.

34:42.150 --> 34:44.152
You enter a gate made of rock...

34:44.235 --> 34:46.237
east of Bukhara...

34:46.322 --> 34:48.614
and begin to ascend
into the Pamir Mountains.

34:52.244 --> 34:55.246
There are great numbers
of all kind of wild beasts.

34:55.331 --> 34:56.498
And the men of BadakhshÄn...

34:56.581 --> 35:00.669
speak of a breed of horse which is said
to be the direct offspring of Alexander's.

35:05.841 --> 35:08.385
Odd bit of trivia.

35:08.469 --> 35:12.056
I've always been taken by
the audacity of Alexander.

35:12.139 --> 35:13.975
A great conqueror.

35:14.058 --> 35:16.643
There are 20 cities
that bear his name, huh?

35:17.937 --> 35:20.147
I now possess them all.

35:21.898 --> 35:24.651
Do you blame me for your
current station in life?

35:24.735 --> 35:25.987
No, Sire.

35:27.613 --> 35:29.656
I simply wonder why you kept me.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.868
I need no reason, Latin.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.914
As my servant...

35:37.999 --> 35:41.085
you will accompany a tax
collector as he makes his rounds.

35:41.168 --> 35:44.838
This will give you a view of my
Imperial City and my subjects.

35:44.921 --> 35:47.008
You will report back to me,
describe what you have seen...

35:47.091 --> 35:48.842
as you saw it.

35:50.344 --> 35:52.304
I'm giving you freedom.

35:55.057 --> 35:57.809
But the walls of my kingdom
stretch beyond the horizon.

35:57.893 --> 35:59.478
Do you understand?

36:00.521 --> 36:02.189
Yes, Sire.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.109
I give you leave.

36:05.192 --> 36:06.485
Hmm?

36:20.332 --> 36:23.710
I assumed you would be
riding to Wuchang by now.

36:23.794 --> 36:27.506
The astrologers told you this morning
was the most auspicious hour to march.

36:27.589 --> 36:30.967
The Confucian advisors said
it is better we ride at night.

36:31.052 --> 36:32.386
Ugh.

36:32.469 --> 36:36.015
They also believe a war
can be won without fighting.

36:36.098 --> 36:38.809
Why must they always speak in riddles?

36:38.892 --> 36:41.728
- "The supreme art of war," Father.
- Mmm.

36:43.064 --> 36:44.398
Still...

36:45.357 --> 36:48.110
tomorrow I ride to Wuchang as a Mongol...

36:48.194 --> 36:50.446
and I carry my father's flag.

36:51.363 --> 36:53.365
You are your mother's son, Jingim.

36:54.283 --> 36:57.203
Educated... patient... noble.

36:57.286 --> 37:01.040
There will be a time for all
these things in the new dynasty.

37:02.749 --> 37:04.876
I must prepare to ride.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.922
My three wives each desire a
visit before I go to battle.

37:11.007 --> 37:12.926
You're also your father's son.

37:25.147 --> 37:29.526
Give to me the nectar...
so I keep it when you go...

37:29.610 --> 37:31.278
and give you a son.

37:34.365 --> 37:36.783
And what if it's a daughter?

37:38.077 --> 37:42.581
Yang the Healer says to do it
like this, in the Golden Lotus,

37:42.664 --> 37:45.251
and I shall finally bear you an heir.

37:48.212 --> 37:50.922
Yang the Healer will be
promoted to the ministry.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.428
Tell me...

37:56.512 --> 37:59.515
does your Chinese wife
do it like this? Huh?

38:00.641 --> 38:01.808
Shh.

39:36.152 --> 39:40.491
Nice. They're so beautiful.
You can let it go.

39:41.408 --> 39:43.660
Are you ready?

39:43.744 --> 39:45.496
Here we go.

39:59.926 --> 40:01.136
Ah...

40:01.220 --> 40:02.888
the Venetian.

40:02.971 --> 40:06.267
A pleasure to formally
make your acquaintance.

40:11.021 --> 40:14.275
She is my charge, so avert your gaze.

40:16.151 --> 40:20.071
She is far past the reach
of a foreign merchant's son.

40:21.282 --> 40:23.033
I followed the wrong path.

40:23.116 --> 40:25.118
Indeed you did...

40:26.328 --> 40:30.165
and the clock tower just struck first bell.

40:30.249 --> 40:32.083
My apologies to you.

40:55.441 --> 40:59.653
The Governor said the songs they sing
about you south of Quinsai are true.

40:59.736 --> 41:01.196
You pleased him greatly.

41:02.448 --> 41:03.824
The Emperor's dying.

41:03.907 --> 41:06.201
You must honor his wishes.

41:06.285 --> 41:07.869
Anything he wants.

41:07.953 --> 41:09.330
Make a truce with the barbarians.

41:09.413 --> 41:13.292
That was not what the Emperor
desired when he was well and strong.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.379
Truce is the dying cry
of the weak and the sick.

41:17.463 --> 41:18.964
Kublai is too strong.

41:19.047 --> 41:22.008
I worry for my daughter if
the barbarians take our city.

41:22.092 --> 41:24.720
Let your Chancellor
manage military affairs.

41:24.803 --> 41:27.263
You manage the imperial bed chamber.

41:28.682 --> 41:32.728
Let the Chancellor not forget who it
was who won him favor in this court.

41:34.521 --> 41:38.484
When the strike of the praying
mantis breaks the body of the cricket,

41:38.567 --> 41:40.319
it is because of its timing.

41:40.402 --> 41:42.571
Timing, Mei Lin.

41:42.654 --> 41:45.991
Trust me, like my soldiers do.

41:48.535 --> 41:51.162
And worry no more.

41:51.246 --> 41:56.167
When the Emperor is gone, you will
still be esteemed in this court.

42:08.347 --> 42:09.473
Get up.

42:11.475 --> 42:12.851
Get up.

42:19.525 --> 42:21.317
I did not ask to train you, Latin.

42:21.402 --> 42:23.404
There is no honor in this for me.

42:26.740 --> 42:28.992
Nor did you ask to be left here by a man

42:29.075 --> 42:32.538
who would trade his own son
like 2 pounds of spice...

42:36.041 --> 42:40.253
for the opportunity to open
trade routes to the West.

42:46.593 --> 42:48.554
Go ahead, take it.

43:03.151 --> 43:04.403
Let him go, Latin.

43:05.278 --> 43:06.655
Let him go.

43:17.958 --> 43:19.418
Get up.

43:21.462 --> 43:24.506
If you wish to survive
here, get up at once.

43:33.348 --> 43:35.851
The foreigner has been summoned.

43:42.065 --> 43:43.984
It is quiet.

43:44.067 --> 43:46.277
As it is before a typhoon.

43:51.199 --> 43:54.786
By the Eternal Blue Sky,
let us sing from our throats

43:54.870 --> 43:57.664
and let them hear the devil
that they are about to meet.

43:57.748 --> 44:01.960
The sons of my father's concubines
always speak the loudest.

44:03.670 --> 44:06.006
We must attack as Genghis would.

44:08.842 --> 44:11.052
Ariq... he is not there.

44:11.136 --> 44:13.388
What do you mean "he is not there"?

44:13.472 --> 44:15.306
No Ariq.

44:15.390 --> 44:17.100
No Golden Horde.

44:17.183 --> 44:19.728
Just grass and sky.

44:32.323 --> 44:33.659
Ah, yes.

44:33.742 --> 44:35.285
Welcome.

44:36.202 --> 44:37.954
Proceed down the hall.

44:39.873 --> 44:43.669
And Master Marco... I will be watching you.

45:26.336 --> 45:27.462
Enter.

45:31.174 --> 45:32.342
Sire.

45:33.885 --> 45:37.555
Your new quarters are more
spacious than the last, no?

45:37.639 --> 45:40.726
Yes, very much. Thank you.

45:45.271 --> 45:47.482
I have a test for you.

45:47.565 --> 45:50.526
You will walk back down
the Hall of Five Desires.

45:50.611 --> 45:52.112
These girls are from Kungurat...

45:53.113 --> 45:56.116
highly skilled in the arts of love.

45:57.117 --> 46:02.413
A man who proves his loyalty to
me can take whatever he wishes.

46:02.497 --> 46:04.625
You may not.

46:04.708 --> 46:06.001
Not yet.

46:08.461 --> 46:12.465
Look... but do not touch.

46:24.853 --> 46:28.023
The walls have eyes, Marco Polo.

47:25.706 --> 47:28.249
Do you hear them taunt us?

47:28.333 --> 47:30.836
They mock our blood.

47:30.919 --> 47:34.965
Even without Ariq's army, we
should still attack like Mongols...

47:35.048 --> 47:37.467
or retreat as cowards.

47:39.135 --> 47:40.887
That is no farming village.

47:41.930 --> 47:44.140
How many men did you say we have?

47:44.224 --> 47:45.683
Five hundred?

47:47.769 --> 47:49.645
And down there?

47:49.730 --> 47:52.523
More. Many more.

47:52.607 --> 47:53.859
As your General...

47:54.650 --> 47:57.695
I advise... retreat.

48:13.044 --> 48:16.297
We do not return home until
we conquer that village.

48:19.634 --> 48:20.802
Give the command.
