00:37.458 --> 00:40.031
[Peter Arnett]
You may hear the bombs now.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.120
If you’re still with us,
you can hear the bombs now.

00:42.213 --> 00:45.547
They are hitting the centre of the city.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.009
[Second reporter]
Now we can hear explosions...

00:47.093 --> 00:51.556
..off in the distance
to the west of central Baghdad.

00:51.641 --> 00:53.847
Clearly I've never been there,...

00:53.935 --> 00:57.885
..but this feels like
we 're in the centre of hell.

01:25.179 --> 01:26.673
[President Bush] The 28 countries...

01:26.764 --> 01:28.258
..with forces in the Gulf area...

01:28.349 --> 01:31.220
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...

01:31.311 --> 01:33.718
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...

01:33.813 --> 01:35.189
..have no choice...

01:35.274 --> 01:38.560
..but to drive Saddam
from Kuwait by force.

01:48.079 --> 01:50.571
[Iraqi spokesman]
A great battle has been initiated.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.955
The mother of all battles.

01:53.044 --> 01:54.372
[Bush] Our objectives...

01:54.462 --> 01:56.835
..in the Persian Gulf area clear,...

01:56.924 --> 01:59.165
..our goals defined.

01:59.259 --> 02:02.344
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait...

02:02.430 --> 02:04.802
..completely, immediately,...

02:04.891 --> 02:06.800
..and without condition.

02:11.314 --> 02:13.687
[Bush] The liberation of Kuwait...

02:13.775 --> 02:15.649
..has now entered a final phase.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.687
I have therefore directed
to use all forces available,...

02:19.783 --> 02:21.693
..including ground forces,...

02:21.786 --> 02:24.786
..to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait.

02:26.206 --> 02:28.081
[Peter Arnett]
At this point it seems inevitable...

02:28.167 --> 02:30.741
..that the ground war is only hours away.

02:30.837 --> 02:33.245
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.

02:43.018 --> 02:46.719
Don't ever for one minute
underestimate the enemy,...

02:46.814 --> 02:48.770
..but remember, we're better soldiers.

02:48.857 --> 02:53.484
We're fighting with better equipment,
we're better trained and a lot smarter.

02:53.571 --> 02:57.272
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...

02:57.367 --> 02:59.858
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.

02:59.953 --> 03:00.867
Any questions?

03:02.373 --> 03:04.247
Let's have a Little prayer.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.492
Dear God, protect us...

03:06.586 --> 03:09.753
..as we protect our country
we so dearly Love.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.969
Keep us safe that we’ll all get home
to see our families and our children.

03:14.053 --> 03:14.966
Amen.

03:15.137 --> 03:16.417
Amen.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.810
- Let's kill 'em all.
- [all] Hu-ah!

03:33.283 --> 03:34.065
You all right, Boylar?

03:35.995 --> 03:37.869
Hell, yeah.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.785
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.743
Yes, sir.

04:05.819 --> 04:07.315
Battle-carry Sabot.

04:09.032 --> 04:10.990
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.

04:16.082 --> 04:17.541
- Sabot loaded.
- Indexed.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.372
Crew report.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.036
- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.

04:20.128 --> 04:22.619
Gunner ready to give Saddam
a new way to hurt.

04:22.714 --> 04:23.628
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!

04:23.715 --> 04:24.664
Hu-ah.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.380
All right, Boylar?

04:27.470 --> 04:28.585
Roger that.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.716
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.

04:37.314 --> 04:40.814
All Sabre elements, this is Sabre-6.

04:40.902 --> 04:41.816
Move out.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.475
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.974
No joy over here.

05:14.065 --> 05:16.272
Permission to try an
alternate route. Over.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.610
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.

05:19.696 --> 05:22.270
- [Nat] No surprises. Copy?
- Roger that.

05:22.366 --> 05:25.569
I'm taking up the right flank.
I’ll get back to you. Out.

05:30.041 --> 05:33.376
Contact. I see flashes, 3,500 metres, sir.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.000
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.

05:40.261 --> 05:41.590
2,500 metres and closing, sir.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.257
Ready to lase and blaze.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.059
Contact, sir. He's in range.

05:46.143 --> 05:48.551
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!

05:48.728 --> 05:49.891
On the way!

05:55.237 --> 05:56.269
Yeah! Yeah!

05:56.363 --> 05:58.024
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

05:58.115 --> 06:00.821
- Find me another target, Patella.
- Loaded!

06:00.910 --> 06:02.653
- Identified.
- Fire.

06:10.254 --> 06:10.870
Fire!

06:20.140 --> 06:22.299
[Patella] Got him! We got him!

06:22.393 --> 06:23.935
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.

06:24.020 --> 06:26.060
We got enemy tangos retreating...

06:26.147 --> 06:28.554
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.

06:28.649 --> 06:32.019
Your pursuit should intercept
their retreat, grid 7-6-5.

06:33.155 --> 06:34.779
Roger that, Liberty-6.

06:34.865 --> 06:36.941
- Troops!
- Troops!

06:56.556 --> 06:58.264
Cease fire! Cease fire!

07:07.777 --> 07:09.236
Come on! Come on!

07:12.491 --> 07:13.867
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

07:13.951 --> 07:15.150
Go ahead, Cougar-6.

07:15.245 --> 07:17.617
I have got mines. Repeat, mines.

07:17.706 --> 07:19.413
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

07:19.499 --> 07:21.956
[Nat] Work your way to grid-line Charlie.

07:22.044 --> 07:25.959
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.

07:47.448 --> 07:49.026
Whoa! What the...

07:49.158 --> 07:50.902
Oh, shit!

07:50.994 --> 07:53.153
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.

07:53.246 --> 07:56.082
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?

07:56.167 --> 07:58.787
- I didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?

07:59.962 --> 08:01.789
Who the hell is shooting at us?

08:01.881 --> 08:03.375
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...

08:03.466 --> 08:05.294
..retreating grid 7-6...

08:05.386 --> 08:07.544
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.

08:07.638 --> 08:08.919
Make it out, and fast!

08:10.391 --> 08:13.060
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.686
Nat, what's happening?

08:14.771 --> 08:17.772
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks
on our flank. We have contact.

08:17.858 --> 08:18.854
This is Cougar-6.

08:18.942 --> 08:21.730
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.

08:21.821 --> 08:23.943
- Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.

08:24.031 --> 08:25.822
Do you or do you not have a target?

08:25.908 --> 08:26.739
I think so!

08:26.826 --> 08:27.941
Gunner, Sabot, tank.

08:28.036 --> 08:29.032
Identify! Up!

08:29.121 --> 08:30.152
Fire!

08:32.375 --> 08:33.869
He just fired, sir.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.039
They're firing at us!

08:35.128 --> 08:37.534
- Loader!
- Up, sir!

08:37.712 --> 08:38.578
Fire!

08:41.926 --> 08:43.255
Yeah! That's the one!

08:43.345 --> 08:44.341
All right.

08:44.429 --> 08:46.921
<i>Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.</i>

08:47.099 --> 08:49.092
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!

08:49.185 --> 08:50.561
I heard you! We... what?

08:50.645 --> 08:52.104
Oh, my God.

08:52.189 --> 08:54.478
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!

08:54.566 --> 08:57.272
<i>Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?</i>

08:57.361 --> 08:58.820
Patella, was that one of our tanks?

08:58.905 --> 09:01.063
He fired, sir.

09:01.157 --> 09:03.066
At us or at the T-72s?

09:03.159 --> 09:04.108
I don't know.

09:04.202 --> 09:06.527
At us or at the T-72s?

09:06.621 --> 09:07.784
I don't know!

09:07.873 --> 09:09.913
[Patella] Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.374
<i>Colonel Serling, report status now.</i>

09:14.964 --> 09:16.672
They have range on us, sir.

09:16.758 --> 09:18.834
Sir!

09:42.454 --> 09:44.197
Oh, Christ, Colonel...

09:48.461 --> 09:51.166
I gave the order to fire.

10:15.659 --> 10:17.368
So with your thermal equipment,...

10:17.453 --> 10:21.367
..confused by burning tanks
and smoke obscuring your visual ID,...

10:21.457 --> 10:26.001
..you couldn't tell the difference
between the T-54 and the Abrams.

10:26.087 --> 10:27.997
I believe that, uh, we...

10:28.090 --> 10:30.581
I should have known the difference,...

10:30.676 --> 10:34.009
..even with the night scope.

10:34.096 --> 10:36.219
If we weren't under attack,...

10:36.307 --> 10:41.385
But, under the circumstances,
there was no way to tell the difference.

10:44.317 --> 10:45.810
Under the circumstances,...

10:45.901 --> 10:48.309
..I suppose there was
no way to tell the difference, but...

10:48.404 --> 10:50.196
There was no way to tell the difference.

10:50.281 --> 10:51.526
Thank you, Colonel.

10:52.325 --> 10:53.784
That's all we need.

11:30.703 --> 11:32.696
[Patella] We’re almost browning out!

11:32.788 --> 11:37.117
[Boylar] We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

11:37.209 --> 11:38.490
Aah!

11:38.586 --> 11:40.246
We just lost Cougar-6!

11:40.338 --> 11:42.581
You just lit up a friendly!

11:43.801 --> 11:44.833
Colonel Serling?

11:44.928 --> 11:45.877
Yes.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.427
You OK? Can I get you something?

11:48.515 --> 11:49.843
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.

11:49.932 --> 11:53.017
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.384
You got it.

11:54.479 --> 11:57.647
We missed you and Meredith
at Banacek's party last night.

11:57.733 --> 12:00.272
I'm too old to dance with you youngsters.

12:00.361 --> 12:03.148
Meredith's not,
so tell her to come without you next time.

12:03.239 --> 12:05.316
Oh, OK. I will do just that...

12:05.409 --> 12:06.358
..next time.

12:09.539 --> 12:10.570
Colonel Serling.

12:10.665 --> 12:13.785
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.

12:13.877 --> 12:14.908
Yes.

12:19.508 --> 12:20.919
Washington Post?

12:22.887 --> 12:24.050
About?

12:26.183 --> 12:27.593
Yes, I was there.

12:27.684 --> 12:30.057
That's a matter of public record.

12:31.814 --> 12:34.602
Well, thank you very much, Mr...

12:34.692 --> 12:39.022
Gartner. Thank you, Mr Gartner,
but I have nothing to say.

12:39.114 --> 12:40.146
No, sir.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.564
No, sir!

12:44.119 --> 12:46.408
Well, I’ll do just that.

12:46.497 --> 12:47.661
Right.

12:52.964 --> 12:55.454
Colonel Serling's here, sir.

12:55.549 --> 12:56.545
Ban.

12:56.634 --> 13:00.466
I'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?

13:00.555 --> 13:03.093
You and Sylvia have been together,
what, a month?

13:03.183 --> 13:06.765
The way she danced with that marine,
it won't last another week.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.847
It may be my last anniversary party.

13:09.148 --> 13:10.643
Were you there for me?

13:10.734 --> 13:12.442
What's up?

13:14.196 --> 13:15.275
Hey, Nat.

13:15.364 --> 13:17.191
I've got to talk to you.

13:17.283 --> 13:18.446
How we holding, Ban?

13:18.534 --> 13:19.814
Running late, sir.

13:19.910 --> 13:22.199
- May I run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.

13:22.288 --> 13:23.367
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...

13:23.456 --> 13:24.405
Boylar?

13:24.499 --> 13:27.536
Tom Boylar. He died in AI Bathra.

13:27.627 --> 13:29.170
He'd been with me a long time.

13:29.254 --> 13:32.172
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.

13:32.258 --> 13:34.500
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.

13:34.594 --> 13:37.631
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.

13:37.722 --> 13:40.048
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.

13:40.142 --> 13:42.115
He's a hero. That's
all they want to know.

13:42.128 --> 13:43.891
Roger, but it's not
just his parents.

13:43.980 --> 13:45.142
We got a call...

13:45.230 --> 13:47.223
..from the Washington Post.

13:47.316 --> 13:48.597
A reporter named Gartner.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.187
A reporter called you about AI Bathra?

13:50.278 --> 13:51.441
You didn't talk?

13:51.529 --> 13:52.479
Of course not.

13:52.573 --> 13:55.409
Nobody’ll hang you out to dry.
I won't let 'em.

13:55.493 --> 13:56.774
Did you listen to the tape, sir?

13:56.995 --> 13:58.370
Colonel, the war's over.

13:58.454 --> 14:02.535
You and I have been given
the great responsibility and privilege...

14:02.626 --> 14:05.580
..of investigating combat medals
for our army.

14:05.671 --> 14:07.913
In other words, we've been passed over.

14:08.049 --> 14:11.049
I prefer to think of it
as a second chance, Nat.

14:11.135 --> 14:13.175
We understand each other?

14:13.262 --> 14:14.259
Yes, sir.

14:14.348 --> 14:15.807
OK.

14:15.891 --> 14:20.435
The White House heard we're considering
the Medal of Honour for a chopper pilot...

14:20.522 --> 14:22.100
..who saved some guys
on a downed Blackhawk.

14:22.190 --> 14:25.191
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.

14:25.276 --> 14:28.313
Which is why
you're taking over the inquiry.

14:28.405 --> 14:32.154
We've got the rescued soldiers
in there for debriefing.

14:34.078 --> 14:35.622
Attention.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.783
Morning. Take your seats.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.038
Everything in order?

14:40.127 --> 14:44.754
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.

14:44.841 --> 14:45.790
Morning, sir.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.212
Good to see you again.

14:47.302 --> 14:49.674
Could we get a picture
of you and the survivors?

14:49.762 --> 14:51.305
No, thank you.

14:51.389 --> 14:53.762
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.180
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.223
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we’ll be fine.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.273
Nat Serling.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.937
I’ll, uh, get out of your way.

15:09.285 --> 15:10.281
- Major.
- Sir.

15:10.370 --> 15:13.704
25 February, these men were
part of a refueling convoy.

15:13.790 --> 15:17.289
Their Blackhawk was shot down
by an SA-7 west of Al Kufan.

15:17.377 --> 15:20.582
Five seconds after it locked on,
we were down.

15:20.673 --> 15:22.124
We didn't know what hit us.

15:22.137 --> 15:24.506
Our lines were surrounding
them so fast,...

15:24.595 --> 15:26.920
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.

15:27.014 --> 15:32.305
Iraqi ground troops on the ridge above
kept them completely pinned down.

15:32.395 --> 15:34.222
Did you discuss surrendering?

15:39.027 --> 15:40.901
Yes, sir, we did.

15:40.988 --> 15:43.277
We were all wounded one way or another.

15:43.366 --> 15:46.533
We weren't trained
for that kind of situation, sir.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.696
Don't have to make excuses to me.

15:48.789 --> 15:50.248
Go on, Sam.

15:50.332 --> 15:52.290
That's all we got so far, sir.

15:52.376 --> 15:54.000
OK.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.328
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.

15:56.422 --> 16:00.669
Well,
as if things weren't bad enough already,...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.801
..one of their T-54s...

16:02.889 --> 16:06.637
..joins the ragheads up on the ridge.

16:11.898 --> 16:14.520
Incoming! Get down!

16:16.904 --> 16:21.649
That round
kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...

16:21.742 --> 16:24.531
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.

16:24.621 --> 16:26.947
So we figure that's it. We're dead.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.792
But then we hear it.

16:29.878 --> 16:32.083
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.

16:37.552 --> 16:38.881
Yeah!

16:38.971 --> 16:39.884
Yeah!

16:42.808 --> 16:44.800
[Serling] This Huey, did it take any fire?

16:44.893 --> 16:45.974
Right off the bat.

16:46.062 --> 16:50.061
But this time
when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.

16:50.150 --> 16:51.859
Ground troops go for cover.

16:52.028 --> 16:54.353
Then the Huey circles
back over the tank...

16:54.447 --> 16:57.697
That's when
they threw something overboard.

16:57.783 --> 17:02.742
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- I couldn't tell, but the tank blew.

17:03.999 --> 17:05.328
Oh!

17:05.416 --> 17:06.698
Yeah!

17:06.794 --> 17:08.420
Man, did it ever blow!

17:09.924 --> 17:13.126
We, uh, we never did see
what knocked the Huey down.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.217
We couldn't see the crash.

17:20.769 --> 17:24.220
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.

17:24.313 --> 17:27.813
The Huey was down below,
between us and the enemy,...

17:27.901 --> 17:30.025
..so they caught most of it.

17:30.113 --> 17:32.651
Any communications
between you and them?

17:32.741 --> 17:35.149
No, sir. As I said, our radio was wasted.

17:35.244 --> 17:37.651
Shouting just draws enemy fire.

17:37.746 --> 17:42.788
So the Iraqis,
they start to close in on the Huey...

17:42.877 --> 17:44.371
..under cover fire,...

17:44.462 --> 17:46.953
..and the Huey returns fire.

17:47.048 --> 17:50.999
We figure it's all over,
and that's when we hear the rescue team.

17:51.095 --> 17:52.589
Cobras, Hueys...

17:52.680 --> 17:54.839
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.

17:57.602 --> 17:59.809
I swear I never heard such a sweet sound.

17:59.897 --> 18:01.936
But now the fuckers are...

18:03.233 --> 18:04.692
I'm sorry, sir.

18:04.776 --> 18:07.398
The Iraqis are letting
loose with all they got.

18:07.488 --> 18:10.359
You were right the first time.

18:11.743 --> 18:14.863
Plus the Huey crew is still banging away.

18:14.955 --> 18:17.826
We load our wounded aboard,...

18:17.917 --> 18:21.251
..and that's when
somebody decided to leave the dead.

18:21.338 --> 18:23.414
I guess it was the commander of the rescue.

18:23.507 --> 18:24.456
Mm-hmm.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.210
And this... Huey crew,...

18:26.302 --> 18:30.346
.they, uh, they returned fire
all through the final rescue?

18:30.431 --> 18:32.305
Yes, sir. I... I think so.

18:32.391 --> 18:34.884
I couldn't see much, though.

18:34.979 --> 18:35.928
I heard it.

18:36.021 --> 18:39.640
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.

18:39.734 --> 18:42.106
I heard it, too.

18:42.194 --> 18:47.438
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt
dropping napalm on the downed choppers.

18:47.534 --> 18:50.701
I don't know if it was Captain Walden...

18:50.788 --> 18:53.279
..but that Huey...

18:53.373 --> 18:54.749
..saved our lives.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.089
It sure sounds like it.

19:03.511 --> 19:05.504
OK.

19:07.139 --> 19:10.675
Thank you for your help.
I’ll look over your statements.

19:10.768 --> 19:11.967
Thank you, sir.

19:12.062 --> 19:13.722
Thank you, Colonel.

19:13.814 --> 19:14.929
That’ll be all.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.016
- Got something for me?
- I do, sir.

19:17.110 --> 19:19.980
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.942
You know I'm going to need
background on these guys.

19:23.033 --> 19:27.197
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater
or an illegal Allen or gays.

19:27.288 --> 19:28.663
That’ll blow it.

19:28.748 --> 19:30.990
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.

19:31.084 --> 19:35.378
It's not the Congressional Medal of
Honour. It's just the Medal of Honour.

19:35.463 --> 19:36.626
Tell that to Congress.

19:36.715 --> 19:38.839
If Captain Walden wins this medal...

19:38.926 --> 19:41.335
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.

19:41.429 --> 19:43.007
It's not a contest.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.767
But that is perfect. That is why I'm here.

19:45.850 --> 19:49.018
I'm not here to get down your
throat, make you crazy,...

19:49.104 --> 19:51.144
..take these facts and twist them.

19:51.232 --> 19:55.182
I just want to get these nuances out of
your head and to get it straight from you.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.733
- It's a woman.
- You didn't know?

19:57.822 --> 20:00.860
What did you think the hoopla was about?

20:00.951 --> 20:03.869
Banacek's got information
on three of Walden's men.

20:03.955 --> 20:08.333
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.

20:08.418 --> 20:14.089
She's the first woman ever to be nominated
for a Medal of Honour for combat.

20:14.174 --> 20:15.550
I mean, this is gold.

20:15.634 --> 20:17.045
It's gold.

20:17.428 --> 20:19.587
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...

20:19.681 --> 20:21.970
..but I've got her Little daughter.

20:22.058 --> 20:24.597
I got the President of the United States.

20:24.686 --> 20:26.976
It's all set in the Rose Garden.

20:27.064 --> 20:31.526
The President's going to lean down and
hang that ribbon round that pretty face.

20:31.611 --> 20:35.906
There is not going to be
a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.

20:35.991 --> 20:38.114
Excuse us.

20:45.252 --> 20:47.126
OK, it was 5 to 1,...

20:47.213 --> 20:49.040
..hook shot.

20:49.131 --> 20:51.373
Me and her are cheerleaders.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.883
- More mashed potatoes.
- [Woman] Sorry, no more potatoes,...

20:54.971 --> 20:57.723
..but how about some bread?

20:57.808 --> 21:00.643
Aah!

21:00.728 --> 21:02.435
[Boylar] Aah!

21:02.520 --> 21:05.190
Daddy, can I have your mashed potatoes?

21:07.694 --> 21:09.023
Daddy?

21:09.113 --> 21:11.152
Sir?

21:11.282 --> 21:13.156
Can I have your mashed potatoes?

21:14.244 --> 21:16.235
M... Yeah. Sure.

21:16.328 --> 21:17.823
Yeah,...

21:17.914 --> 21:19.456
..soldier.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.703
You want 'em all?

21:22.878 --> 21:24.076
That enough?

21:27.800 --> 21:28.749
More?

21:30.345 --> 21:31.294
Hello?

21:31.388 --> 21:33.345
Yes.

21:33.432 --> 21:35.721
Uh, who is calling, please?

21:35.809 --> 21:37.185
Just a minute.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.059
It's for you.

21:40.148 --> 21:41.096
Who is it?

21:41.190 --> 21:42.684
Somebody Gartner.

21:45.069 --> 21:47.228
Want some more peas?

22:24.948 --> 22:26.111
Excuse me.

22:39.841 --> 22:41.798
Where are you going?

22:41.885 --> 22:43.048
Fort Hood.

22:43.136 --> 22:47.348
General Hershberg's got me investigating
a Medal of Honour.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.390
It's a woman.

22:49.476 --> 22:51.054
Good for her.

22:52.188 --> 22:53.303
Posthumous.

22:53.397 --> 22:55.641
Too bad, but still good for her.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.983
Mmm. Too bad.

23:06.663 --> 23:10.163
You talk to the investigators today?

23:10.250 --> 23:11.281
Right.

23:13.754 --> 23:15.664
It's all right, isn't it, Nat?

23:17.008 --> 23:18.551
Yeah. Fine.

23:22.265 --> 23:24.055
How long are you gone for?

23:24.141 --> 23:25.635
Couple of days.

23:29.439 --> 23:31.645
Then why are you emptying
your sock drawer?

23:34.486 --> 23:38.070
I may be gone more than a couple of days.

23:47.168 --> 23:48.283
Nat.

23:48.378 --> 23:49.539
Yes.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.295
I don't know what's happening.

23:53.382 --> 23:55.043
Everything's fine.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.755
I'm handling it.

24:30.008 --> 24:33.424
[Nat] Mr. Rady,
you were Captain Walden's copilot.

24:33.512 --> 24:34.425
That's right.

24:34.513 --> 24:38.428
[Nat] Can you tell me
what you remember about Al Kufan?

24:48.529 --> 24:50.072
I remember the earth.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.200
I remember... llario's face.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.912
I wish...

25:00.709 --> 25:04.495
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.914
We were just doing our job.

25:07.008 --> 25:10.129
It's not Ren's fault I got hit.

25:10.220 --> 25:14.135
She sure as hell saved the lives
of those guys on the Blackhawk.

25:15.101 --> 25:18.352
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?

25:18.438 --> 25:20.098
She was so butch.

25:20.189 --> 25:21.600
Honey, shut up.

25:23.694 --> 25:25.437
She was, you know.

25:26.823 --> 25:29.860
One of those women
who want to be officers...

25:29.952 --> 25:31.861
Annie, shut up.

25:34.498 --> 25:36.954
She gave her life for those men.

25:41.381 --> 25:42.757
She was a soldier.

25:59.193 --> 26:01.482
There she blows.

26:13.376 --> 26:15.535
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!

26:21.927 --> 26:25.592
- Kill that motherfucker, Bonfires!
- I may as well be pissing on him.

26:25.681 --> 26:28.801
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!

26:32.815 --> 26:34.974
- Making another pass, Ran?
- Yep.

26:35.068 --> 26:38.401
No! We should go for altitude,
and call for support.

26:38.488 --> 26:40.030
After we slow down that tank!

26:40.657 --> 26:43.742
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!

26:43.827 --> 26:47.113
Altameyer,
unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.998
Get ready to push it overboard.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.458
Push it overboard, ma'am?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.583
llario, unhook the flare gun!

26:52.671 --> 26:53.750
What the fuck...

26:53.839 --> 26:55.464
Do it!

26:55.549 --> 26:57.589
It's a bomb, asshole!

26:59.929 --> 27:01.472
Target coming up!

27:01.973 --> 27:03.004
Gimme more!

27:03.099 --> 27:04.344
Ready here!

27:05.477 --> 27:06.556
- Got it?
- I got it!

27:09.398 --> 27:11.448
Tell us when you're there!
He’ll kick it!

27:11.461 --> 27:13.147
Allow for the
speed of the craft!

27:13.236 --> 27:16.190
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.

27:17.365 --> 27:18.694
Pick your moment!

27:18.784 --> 27:19.614
Now!

27:32.007 --> 27:34.083
Oh, my God!

27:36.805 --> 27:37.801
Oh!

27:39.266 --> 27:40.547
Whoa! Shit!

27:40.643 --> 27:42.718
Whoa! Oh, God!

27:42.811 --> 27:45.018
Hang on, llario! Grab a hold of me!

27:45.105 --> 27:46.564
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!

27:46.649 --> 27:49.899
Hang on.
Come on, llario! Pull yourself up!

27:49.986 --> 27:51.694
Do something!

27:51.780 --> 27:55.195
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday!

27:55.283 --> 27:57.906
llario,... call it in!

27:59.539 --> 28:02.540
[Ilario]
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!

28:02.626 --> 28:03.954
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

28:04.044 --> 28:06.333
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!

28:06.422 --> 28:07.536
This is Dustoff-3!

28:07.631 --> 28:09.624
We're going down! We're going down!

28:09.716 --> 28:11.591
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

28:11.677 --> 28:12.626
We are going down!

28:12.720 --> 28:16.255
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!

28:16.349 --> 28:18.223
We're going down! Oh, my God...

28:31.200 --> 28:32.230
That's it.

28:34.286 --> 28:37.702
I woke up three days later
on a hospital ship.

28:37.790 --> 28:39.450
Nearly bought it, that's sure.

28:43.131 --> 28:47.258
[Larry King] When did you decide
the type of career in the Army you wanted?

28:47.343 --> 28:51.840
[Schwarzkopf] That happened about
my third year at West Point when I was...

28:51.932 --> 28:54.423
I could have gone in the Air Force.

28:54.518 --> 28:56.475
I stood high enough in my class.

28:56.562 --> 29:00.476
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.

29:00.566 --> 29:03.354
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?

29:03.445 --> 29:04.904
I know so.

29:04.989 --> 29:06.483
Really. How?

29:06.574 --> 29:09.030
I was with him in the Gulf.

29:09.118 --> 29:10.067
No shit.

29:10.161 --> 29:13.245
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.

29:13.331 --> 29:14.611
Hu-ah.

29:14.707 --> 29:16.416
Hu-ah.

29:16.501 --> 29:19.289
Once upon a time,
I was humping in the delta.

29:19.379 --> 29:21.419
- With who?
- The 9 Th.

29:21.507 --> 29:24.258
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.

29:24.344 --> 29:27.013
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.

29:27.097 --> 29:31.047
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.

29:33.062 --> 29:36.846
They won't find any criminal culpability
in the AI Bathra incident.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.519
You got nothing to worry about.

29:38.609 --> 29:40.068
Those were my men.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.395
I put that badly. I'm sorry.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.275
Look, I went to Virginia
and spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Boylar.

29:48.622 --> 29:49.866
You what?

29:49.956 --> 29:54.085
I'm sorry, but they got a right
to know what happened to their son.

29:58.758 --> 29:59.956
I’ll take that.

30:20.366 --> 30:22.953
[Serling] And this
Huey crew, they, uh,

30:22.966 --> 30:25.823
returned fire all through
the final rescue?

30:25.914 --> 30:27.408
[Chelli] Yes, sir. I think so.

30:27.499 --> 30:28.779
I couldn't see much.

30:28.875 --> 30:31.628
[Thompson] I heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.

30:31.712 --> 30:32.827
Not know A-K or M-60.

30:32.922 --> 30:34.416
[Egan] I heard it, too.

30:34.507 --> 30:38.173
[Chelli] Last thing we see
is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...

30:38.262 --> 30:40.171
..on the two downed choppers.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.180
Oh!

31:35.535 --> 31:36.484
Sir!

31:39.915 --> 31:42.870
All right, this is anti-fungal cream,...

31:42.960 --> 31:45.115
..but to kill the athlete's
foot when you're

31:45.128 --> 31:47.005
in the shower, just
piss on your feet.

31:47.089 --> 31:48.204
That's disgusting.

31:48.299 --> 31:50.422
What've you got for me today?

31:50.510 --> 31:53.295
You want to get rid of
the allergies to bee

31:53.308 --> 31:55.850
pollen, then no
caffeine, no chocolate.

31:55.933 --> 31:58.603
Jesus. I give up coffee,
you can bury me now.

32:00.647 --> 32:04.266
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?

32:04.359 --> 32:05.558
How many do you want?

32:05.653 --> 32:07.112
I take eight every day.

32:07.196 --> 32:08.110
Four's good.

32:08.197 --> 32:11.281
- I need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?

32:11.367 --> 32:16.160
I'm investigating the recommendation to
award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.

32:17.791 --> 32:18.741
Rowtero?

32:18.835 --> 32:19.784
Yeah?

32:19.878 --> 32:21.289
Can you cover for me?

32:21.379 --> 32:23.917
I'm going to go feed the cancer genes.

32:24.007 --> 32:26.463
Do you really need to, uh, I mean...

32:31.724 --> 32:33.302
It's fine.

32:33.393 --> 32:35.136
Uh, what do you want to know?

32:36.396 --> 32:38.684
How long were you with Captain Walden?

32:38.773 --> 32:40.981
Um... over... over two years.

32:41.068 --> 32:42.479
Quite a long time.

32:42.570 --> 32:43.685
Yeah.

32:43.780 --> 32:44.859
You were her medic.

32:44.948 --> 32:46.490
Yes, sir.

32:48.118 --> 32:49.695
I don't fly any more though.

32:51.872 --> 32:53.663
Well, don't miss it, do you?

32:53.749 --> 32:54.698
Never.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.334
Never again.

32:56.418 --> 32:58.043
That's quite a habit you got.

32:59.255 --> 33:00.963
Yeah, it's, uh...

33:01.049 --> 33:03.671
..one of the few things I can call my own.

33:09.267 --> 33:10.298
So...

33:10.393 --> 33:12.801
..tell me what happened at AI Kufan.

33:23.659 --> 33:25.652
See, I'd, uh...

33:27.038 --> 33:29.824
..I'd never been in... in combat.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.882
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

33:41.010 --> 33:44.178
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3...

34:10.545 --> 34:11.494
llario?

34:11.588 --> 34:13.081
Yeah, I'm OK.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.380
Rady's hurt.

34:15.467 --> 34:16.962
Monfriez?

34:17.053 --> 34:18.251
100%%%.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.253
AItameyer?

34:20.389 --> 34:21.848
Functioning.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.427
Fire in the hold!

34:29.400 --> 34:31.228
[Ilario] Come here, buddy.

34:34.112 --> 34:35.228
This is Dustoff-3.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.152
Acknowledge.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.114
This is Dustoff-3.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.150
Here. Come on.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.703
This is Dustoff-3.

34:40.788 --> 34:41.902
Come on.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.833
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
AItameyer, how's that fire?

34:44.918 --> 34:47.289
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.

34:49.924 --> 34:50.873
Enemy at the back door!

34:50.966 --> 34:51.962
Come on! Come on!

34:52.051 --> 34:53.676
Monfriez, get that saw working!

34:53.761 --> 34:54.793
Come on! Get down!

35:00.477 --> 35:02.137
I've got the M-16!

35:03.689 --> 35:04.720
llario?

35:04.815 --> 35:06.060
He's bad. It's the lung.

35:15.369 --> 35:17.445
We gotta get him out of here.

35:18.373 --> 35:21.244
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?

35:21.334 --> 35:23.208
Dead. So's the ADT.

35:24.504 --> 35:26.461
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!

35:26.548 --> 35:28.042
We might be here a while!

35:28.175 --> 35:29.206
Captain!

35:33.640 --> 35:36.558
You've seen me do this a million times.
You’ll be fine.

35:37.936 --> 35:38.932
Ammo?

35:39.021 --> 35:41.477
I got this belt and three more boxes.

35:43.609 --> 35:47.478
OK, AItameyer, rip out everything
you can from the inside.

35:47.572 --> 35:49.197
We're gonna make a perimeter.

35:49.283 --> 35:51.571
Monfriez, cover us!

35:51.660 --> 35:52.656
Go!

35:58.961 --> 36:01.037
Where's our Kevlar?

36:01.130 --> 36:02.161
I got one!

36:03.632 --> 36:04.830
Well, put it on!

36:11.516 --> 36:12.927
Unh. How's he doing?

36:13.018 --> 36:14.347
He's the same.

36:14.436 --> 36:15.846
I need a hook.

36:24.239 --> 36:25.948
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.

36:26.033 --> 36:27.148
Then we wait.

36:27.243 --> 36:28.273
For what?

36:28.368 --> 36:29.911
For the good guys.

36:33.875 --> 36:37.244
You won't think it's so funny
when I nail your fucking ass!

36:40.592 --> 36:42.631
Yeah, they were laughing.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.926
You about, uh... You done?

36:47.140 --> 36:49.928
So tell me what happened...

36:50.019 --> 36:52.177
..during the night.

36:52.313 --> 36:54.638
You were there. You saw the nights.

36:54.731 --> 36:56.392
You know, just... it was black.

36:56.484 --> 36:57.682
Just... black.

36:57.777 --> 36:59.818
Tell me what happened that night.

37:01.449 --> 37:03.655
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.

37:03.743 --> 37:09.746
Um... it's not like
any of us were going to sleep anyway.

37:12.335 --> 37:15.207
[Monfriez]
Head down, AItameyer. You might lose it.

37:17.091 --> 37:18.087
You OK, Captain?

37:18.176 --> 37:20.168
Shit in my eye.

37:20.260 --> 37:22.089
Will our guys come tonight?

37:22.222 --> 37:23.598
They’ll be here.

37:23.682 --> 37:25.260
Dust is blowing pretty bad.

37:25.351 --> 37:27.723
I don't know
how much longer Rady can hang on.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.220
I can hear the rag heads
when you're not gabbing.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.272
Then I'd suggest everybody just...

37:53.216 --> 37:54.794
They're going away.

37:54.884 --> 37:56.462
It was just a probe.

37:56.553 --> 37:57.632
llario?

37:57.721 --> 37:58.669
I'm OK.

37:58.763 --> 37:59.712
AItameyer?

37:59.806 --> 38:00.588
My ear!

38:00.682 --> 38:01.678
Monfriez?

38:01.766 --> 38:03.391
I... I took one.

38:03.477 --> 38:08.473
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?

38:08.901 --> 38:09.897
Unh...

38:09.985 --> 38:11.858
Oh, shit.

38:11.945 --> 38:13.653
Stay with Rady.

38:19.871 --> 38:21.531
I like to come here.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.703
It's not just the bikinis,
although they ain't bad.

38:25.794 --> 38:28.416
It's these kids.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.333
I like to watch them, you know?

38:30.425 --> 38:33.426
My folks had this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.597
I still go there
sometimes, watch 'em dive.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.224
They do the damnedest things.

38:38.308 --> 38:40.764
They never think about the consequences.

38:42.730 --> 38:44.189
Imagine that.

38:44.274 --> 38:47.441
Imagine not thinking
about the consequences?

38:47.527 --> 38:49.272
Imagine that.

38:53.409 --> 38:55.319
Are... are we done?

38:58.290 --> 39:00.579
After the attack...

39:00.668 --> 39:02.541
..during the night...

39:02.627 --> 39:04.585
What?

39:04.671 --> 39:06.166
I mean, we waited.

39:06.257 --> 39:07.668
I... I still don't...

39:07.758 --> 39:12.506
- I... I don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.

39:16.101 --> 39:22.105
Well, Karen,...
the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.641
Ohh...

39:24.737 --> 39:27.904
Unh...

39:27.990 --> 39:29.947
Unh!

39:30.993 --> 39:32.370
How many rounds left?

39:32.454 --> 39:33.735
Just a sec.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.242
How many rounds?

39:35.332 --> 39:37.242
I just opened my last can of ammo.

39:37.502 --> 39:39.411
Five mags for the M-16,...

39:39.504 --> 39:40.583
..9-mll's full.

39:40.797 --> 39:41.710
Mine's empty.

39:43.508 --> 39:45.132
Fire a couple of rounds off.

39:45.218 --> 39:48.255
- Let 'em know we're still alive.
- Roger that, Captain.

39:50.140 --> 39:53.760
Now save your ammo
for something you can see.

39:55.981 --> 40:00.359
During the course of the incident,
did she display any doubt, any fear...

40:00.444 --> 40:03.896
..when she had to make
these life-and-death decisions?

40:03.990 --> 40:05.817
No.

40:05.909 --> 40:07.237
No. Never.

40:07.326 --> 40:08.524
She just made 'em.

40:08.619 --> 40:10.577
Just like that?

40:10.663 --> 40:12.158
Just like that.

40:12.249 --> 40:15.121
Karen,... the captain...
she had this quality.

40:15.211 --> 40:17.833
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

40:17.923 --> 40:19.749
We knew they were out there,...

40:19.841 --> 40:21.501
..sneaking up on us.

40:21.593 --> 40:25.259
But we also knew
at first light they were going to attack.

40:25.347 --> 40:29.346
I don't know why people think only
good things happen when the sun rises.

40:29.602 --> 40:30.717
Incoming!

40:41.158 --> 40:42.153
How many?

40:42.242 --> 40:43.523
100. Maybe more.

40:43.619 --> 40:45.161
Any good at hand-to-hand?

40:45.246 --> 40:47.534
Wait till they get closer.

40:47.622 --> 40:50.244
Make every round count!

40:53.379 --> 40:54.922
- Shit!
- Quiet!

40:55.006 --> 40:56.549
What in Christ for?

40:56.633 --> 40:58.127
They know we're here!

40:58.218 --> 41:00.176
Quiet! I hear something!

41:03.641 --> 41:05.551
Choppers!

41:08.063 --> 41:10.389
Hey!

41:10.483 --> 41:13.317
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

41:13.402 --> 41:15.062
Go! Go!

41:15.154 --> 41:16.434
Yeah!

41:25.666 --> 41:27.042
Let's get out of here!

41:27.126 --> 41:28.157
llario, get the captain!

41:28.252 --> 41:29.663
There's the rescue!

41:37.345 --> 41:39.588
Help Rady!

41:39.681 --> 41:41.306
Pick him up!

41:41.392 --> 41:43.136
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!

41:44.772 --> 41:47.228
Come on! Let's move! Move it!

41:48.359 --> 41:49.817
Gotta go! We gotta go!

41:49.902 --> 41:52.025
Come back for me with a stretcher!

41:52.113 --> 41:53.192
Go!

42:13.805 --> 42:16.046
llario, let's get the fuck outta here!

42:17.767 --> 42:19.676
Get the fuck outta here!

42:33.118 --> 42:34.529
Aah!

42:34.787 --> 42:36.162
Aah!

42:38.625 --> 42:39.656
Medic!

42:41.794 --> 42:43.621
Come on! Get him up!

42:47.593 --> 42:49.717
Move! Come on! Let's go!

42:53.559 --> 42:54.637
Where's Walden?

42:55.977 --> 42:57.555
Captain Walden is dead.

43:01.150 --> 43:03.855
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.

43:03.945 --> 43:07.029
We have all the friends.
You're clear and hot.

43:07.114 --> 43:09.785
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.

43:18.921 --> 43:20.913
So...

43:21.006 --> 43:23.462
Is she gonna get it?
Is she gonna get the medal?

43:23.550 --> 43:27.050
Well, I sincerely hope so.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.639
I just... I don't want to
tell that story again.

43:30.726 --> 43:32.932
Not one more time.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.680
Yeah, I understand.

43:36.565 --> 43:37.941
May I be excused?

43:38.025 --> 43:40.149
Yes, you can.

43:40.236 --> 43:43.191
Oh, one more thing I'm confused about.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.277
This M-16...

43:47.619 --> 43:48.568
What?

43:48.662 --> 43:50.536
Did it run out of ammo?

43:52.292 --> 43:54.250
Uh, what did I say?

43:55.588 --> 43:58.374
I don't remember. That's why I'm asking.

43:59.925 --> 44:01.633
I guess, uh...

44:01.719 --> 44:05.717
I guess it ran out of ammo
sometime during the morning.

44:05.807 --> 44:07.634
Um...

44:07.726 --> 44:09.386
Or, no, sometime during the night...

44:09.478 --> 44:10.854
I don't know.

44:10.938 --> 44:14.272
See, the Blackhawk crew
said they heard M-16 fire...

44:14.359 --> 44:17.645
..during the rescue that morning.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.690
Did they?

44:19.782 --> 44:22.273
That's right.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.028
Must've been wrong, then.

44:24.119 --> 44:25.068
Them or you?

44:25.162 --> 44:26.621
Who, them or you?

44:26.706 --> 44:27.986
Oh, them. Them, yeah.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.707
No, they must have been wrong.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.751
OK.

44:32.879 --> 44:33.911
OK.

44:35.675 --> 44:37.169
What about the letter?

44:38.636 --> 44:39.585
A what?

44:39.762 --> 44:43.761
You and Walden traded letters to send home
in case anything happened to you.

44:43.851 --> 44:44.965
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.389
So, who was hers to?

44:46.479 --> 44:47.428
Her folks.

44:47.522 --> 44:50.012
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.

44:50.107 --> 44:51.815
Her folks, they're good people.

44:51.901 --> 44:53.810
They got a farm out in Abilene.

44:53.903 --> 44:57.903
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid
while we went out on exercises.

44:57.992 --> 45:00.365
Yeah... Yeah.

45:02.205 --> 45:03.153
OK.

45:03.247 --> 45:05.039
Thank you, Specialist.

45:05.125 --> 45:06.584
Thank you very much, sir.

45:12.550 --> 45:14.507
I read somewhere...

45:14.594 --> 45:17.844
..that if a child doesn't
see a person die,...

45:17.930 --> 45:21.016
..or dead, like in a casket,...

45:21.102 --> 45:24.222
..that the person isn't
really dead for them.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.232
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

45:28.568 --> 45:29.599
Yes, ma'am.

45:31.613 --> 45:34.947
It was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...

45:35.034 --> 45:37.703
..for Karen to want to
be a helicopter pilot?

45:37.787 --> 45:39.994
I guess that's my fault.

45:40.081 --> 45:42.407
I took her to the fair when she was 11.

45:42.501 --> 45:45.787
12 - 7th grade.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.667
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.

45:48.758 --> 45:50.834
Small one with a bubble up front.

45:50.927 --> 45:53.501
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.

45:53.597 --> 45:56.301
I bought Karen a ticket.

45:56.391 --> 45:58.514
It was a short ride.

45:58.602 --> 46:01.272
But when she came down...

46:01.355 --> 46:04.274
Well, I don't think
she ever came down, actually.

46:05.069 --> 46:09.814
She showed up
at the dinner table one day,...

46:09.907 --> 46:12.861
..just after she finished TCU.

46:12.952 --> 46:14.862
She's joined the Army.

46:14.954 --> 46:16.782
She wants to fly helicopters.

46:16.873 --> 46:18.451
She's real stubborn about it, too.

46:18.542 --> 46:20.581
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.

46:20.668 --> 46:22.543
So's Anne Marie here.

46:25.133 --> 46:27.126
Come here, honey.

46:27.219 --> 46:28.215
Excuse me.

46:35.185 --> 46:36.728
Uh, the young men,...

46:36.812 --> 46:40.680
..the ones that came to
tell us about Karen...

46:40.775 --> 46:43.349
..they were dressed just like you.

46:43.445 --> 46:46.233
Oh, I see.

46:46.323 --> 46:47.438
Major Teegarden,...

46:47.533 --> 46:52.113
..her commanding officer, he came, too,
when he came back from the Gulf.

46:52.623 --> 46:55.909
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.

46:57.420 --> 46:59.328
Meant a lot to us...

46:59.421 --> 47:01.379
..him coming to see us,...

47:01.465 --> 47:04.253
..telling us in person how Karen died.

47:04.344 --> 47:07.346
I lost men over there, too.

47:07.432 --> 47:08.926
I spoke to the major.

47:09.017 --> 47:14.094
Everybody thought the world of your
daughter. So did Specialist llario.

47:15.690 --> 47:17.979
It would sure help if I
could see her letter.

47:18.068 --> 47:19.978
I mean, if it's not too private.

47:20.070 --> 47:21.066
Letter?

47:21.155 --> 47:23.397
From llario?

47:25.117 --> 47:28.035
I’ll check my notes. Must be my mistake.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.865
This her husband here?

47:29.957 --> 47:32.911
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.

47:33.002 --> 47:35.576
Her husband's up in Michigan.

47:37.131 --> 47:40.298
He and Karen divorced
after only a year or so.

47:40.385 --> 47:45.463
He never... well,... it was no picnic.

47:45.558 --> 47:47.551
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.

47:47.643 --> 47:51.428
We'd have been thrilled to have
Anne Marie with us all the time,...

47:51.523 --> 47:54.939
..what with the Army and all.

47:55.027 --> 47:57.020
But Karen was a real good mom.

47:58.197 --> 48:01.982
Never asked for help
unless she really needed it.

48:02.077 --> 48:04.947
You can't imagine how
hard it was for her...

48:05.038 --> 48:08.490
..to go off and leave that Little girl
to fight in a war,...

48:08.584 --> 48:11.918
..but it was important to Karen
to do her duty.

48:12.004 --> 48:13.630
So she went.

48:39.119 --> 48:42.155
You've been out here 20 minutes
since I spotted you.

48:42.247 --> 48:44.917
- How much longer before that?
- 15.

48:48.463 --> 48:51.036
I see you, uh...

48:51.132 --> 48:52.960
..got the new refrigerator.

48:53.051 --> 48:57.631
Do you think the kids will understand
why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...

48:57.724 --> 49:00.844
..instead of playing with them
in the front yard?

49:00.936 --> 49:03.641
Or at Fort Hood,
like you told me you were?

49:05.775 --> 49:07.020
Are you back?

49:08.151 --> 49:09.610
I'm in transit.

49:19.582 --> 49:22.073
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...

49:22.168 --> 49:26.000
..to figure out how to be an Army wife
without obliterating myself.

49:26.089 --> 49:28.047
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

49:28.133 --> 49:30.210
I know you did, Mer.

49:31.262 --> 49:33.384
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...

49:33.472 --> 49:35.963
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...

49:36.058 --> 49:38.347
..if my husband wasn't
in the Army any more.

49:38.436 --> 49:40.809
The Army's my life, Mer.

49:41.983 --> 49:43.643
And so are we.

49:46.654 --> 49:49.026
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.

49:49.115 --> 49:52.615
You just have to admit that you can't.

49:54.371 --> 49:56.910
You have to want to be here with us,...

49:56.999 --> 49:58.031
..that's all.

50:01.046 --> 50:02.873
We’ll be here.

50:06.093 --> 50:07.469
For a while.

50:19.274 --> 50:20.473
Now go away.

50:21.193 --> 50:24.527
If you're not going to stay,
I don't want the kids to see you.

50:31.205 --> 50:33.875
<i>This M-16, did it run out of ammo?</i>

50:33.958 --> 50:35.868
[Woman] Yes, sir?

50:35.961 --> 50:40.040
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- I don',t remember...

50:45.764 --> 50:47.342
Hey, Nat, what's up?

50:47.432 --> 50:48.843
General.

50:48.934 --> 50:52.517
It's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.

50:52.604 --> 50:53.600
Discrepancies?

50:53.689 --> 50:54.804
Yes, sir.

50:54.898 --> 50:57.900
I knew those White House clowns
were up to something.

50:57.985 --> 50:59.978
If she doesn't deserve
it, she won't get it.

50:59.991 --> 51:01.355
It's not Captain Walden, sir.

51:01.448 --> 51:05.148
It's some of the details of the stories
I'm getting from her crew.

51:05.243 --> 51:08.744
- I don't know how significant...
- I'm drowning in paper here.

51:08.831 --> 51:11.749
They're crawling all over my ass
for combat assessments,...

51:11.835 --> 51:17.078
Sir, I just wanted to let you know this is
not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.

51:17.174 --> 51:21.717
Now, this specialist, uh, llario,
there's something funny about his story.

51:21.804 --> 51:25.339
We're not giving the medal to llario.
We're giving it to Walden.

51:25.433 --> 51:26.429
Roger.

51:26.518 --> 51:27.930
Splendid. Move forward.

51:28.021 --> 51:32.184
OK. The discrepancies specifically
relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...

51:32.275 --> 51:35.940
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses
ever agree on every detail.

51:36.029 --> 51:38.022
You know that as well as I do.

51:38.115 --> 51:39.859
When do we get that report?

51:39.950 --> 51:41.859
I want the White House off my back.

51:41.952 --> 51:43.327
A few days, sir.

51:43.412 --> 51:48.240
You agree that this report should be
as detailed and accurate as possible?

51:48.626 --> 51:50.667
Which means exactly what, Colonel?

51:50.755 --> 51:54.207
Which means exactly what I said, sir.

51:56.510 --> 52:01.090
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy
of Colonel Serling's AI Bathra deposition.

52:01.183 --> 52:04.634
The investigator seemed to have
misplaced the last one.

52:04.728 --> 52:06.187
Rise above.

52:06.272 --> 52:07.896
This will all be over soon.

52:09.525 --> 52:12.397
Will there be
a public statement of the facts...

52:12.487 --> 52:14.362
..when the investigation is over, sir?

52:14.448 --> 52:18.826
There's been a decision not to release
any findings until every case...

52:18.912 --> 52:20.820
..has been thoroughly reviewed.

52:20.913 --> 52:23.950
Well, how long do you imagine
that will be, sir?

52:24.042 --> 52:26.879
I mean, next time I see
Lieutenant Boylar's

52:26.892 --> 52:29.998
parents, I'd like to tell
them the whole truth.

52:30.090 --> 52:34.634
You know how many grieving parents
I had to deal with during Vietnam?

52:34.721 --> 52:35.752
This is not Vietnam.

52:35.847 --> 52:39.098
Lieutenant Boylar's tank
was hit by uranium-depleted shells.

52:39.184 --> 52:42.636
We're the only country
in the world that uses them.

52:42.730 --> 52:46.775
We got reporters from the Washington Post
looking for the truth,...

52:46.859 --> 52:49.397
..and the only person that knows it
can't say it...

52:49.487 --> 52:53.486
..because these investigators
are dragging their backsides!

52:53.575 --> 52:57.824
Someone has got to be
accountable for this,... sir.

53:08.092 --> 53:09.468
Take a seat.

53:21.608 --> 53:25.273
Nat, I'm going to give you
all the rope in the world.

53:25.362 --> 53:27.604
First you imply I'm not interested...

53:27.698 --> 53:29.987
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.

53:30.075 --> 53:34.323
Now you're suggesting there must be
some cover-up going on about AI Bathra.

53:34.414 --> 53:36.323
So how do you want me to respond?

53:36.416 --> 53:38.374
As your commanding officer,...

53:38.460 --> 53:42.459
..or as your friend
who nursed you, pushed promotions,...

53:42.548 --> 53:45.918
..and fucking burped your kids
at their baptisms?

53:47.387 --> 53:49.427
Just how should I respond?

53:50.974 --> 53:52.433
I'm sorry, sir.

53:53.685 --> 53:55.844
I should hope by God you would be.

53:56.814 --> 53:58.474
Now,...

53:58.566 --> 54:02.400
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...

54:03.614 --> 54:04.942
..I've been there.

54:06.492 --> 54:07.523
Well, this...

54:07.618 --> 54:09.528
..whole mess...

54:11.122 --> 54:13.875
It's my ass on the line
right there beside yours.

54:13.959 --> 54:17.542
I can feel the chilling the air
as well as you can.

54:17.629 --> 54:19.503
Yes, sir.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.129
And I know about the drinking.

54:22.302 --> 54:25.304
And if I have to write you up,...

54:25.389 --> 54:27.963
..it’ll just be one more
bite out of your record.

54:28.059 --> 54:29.256
Clean it up.

54:29.351 --> 54:31.843
Get yourself in a programme.

54:31.938 --> 54:33.812
I’ll be looking for that report.

54:33.898 --> 54:35.441
Soon.

54:50.251 --> 54:52.300
[Nat] Yes, this is
the Serling residence.

54:52.313 --> 54:53.952
[Mer] We’re nothing
right now...

54:54.047 --> 54:58.958
- But at the tone, leave a message and...
- [Kids] We’ll call you when we get home.

55:22.662 --> 55:24.370
You better get your head into this!

55:24.455 --> 55:28.289
I'm going to drop you
from this programme like a hot rock!

55:28.378 --> 55:29.920
You better hurry up!

55:31.632 --> 55:34.751
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
I’ll get him for you.

55:34.843 --> 55:35.792
Thank you.

55:35.885 --> 55:39.255
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?

55:39.348 --> 55:41.720
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?

55:41.809 --> 55:43.469
You see that man?

55:43.561 --> 55:47.096
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.

55:47.189 --> 55:49.598
You never leave a man behind.

55:49.693 --> 55:53.027
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.

55:53.531 --> 55:54.860
[Nat] You were in Panama?

55:54.949 --> 55:56.574
Yes, sir.

55:56.660 --> 55:57.941
Were you there, sir?

55:58.036 --> 55:59.578
Yes, I was.

55:59.662 --> 56:02.533
And you were also in Desert Storm?

56:02.624 --> 56:04.167
Roger that, sir.

56:05.669 --> 56:08.243
How'd you come to be
on Captain Walden's chopper?

56:08.339 --> 56:10.962
I used to hang around the medivac unit.

56:11.052 --> 56:12.629
Wanted to be a medic?

56:12.719 --> 56:15.674
Wanted to hump a nurse once.
That count, sir?

56:17.558 --> 56:18.839
See, I play poker.

56:18.935 --> 56:22.803
Those medivac folks, between missions,
had a lot of time on their hands.

56:22.898 --> 56:24.724
Want to know a poker secret, sir?

56:24.816 --> 56:25.765
Always.

56:26.902 --> 56:30.567
The people you play against,
find out what they're interested in.

56:30.656 --> 56:32.068
Pretend you're interested.

56:32.159 --> 56:36.822
They start running off at the mouth,
don't pay attention to their cards.

56:36.914 --> 56:40.698
Medevac folks,
they Love to talk about their choppers.

56:42.962 --> 56:44.754
Paid for this baby.

56:52.347 --> 56:54.175
So, talk to me about, um,...

56:54.267 --> 56:56.426
..25 February.

56:56.520 --> 56:58.976
25 February? Yes, sir.

57:01.526 --> 57:02.985
I had some phys rehab time.

57:03.068 --> 57:04.610
Got into boxing.

57:04.695 --> 57:05.940
Want a soda pop?

57:06.030 --> 57:07.608
No, sir. No, I'm good.

57:08.783 --> 57:10.277
25 February.

57:10.368 --> 57:12.242
So, 25 February...

57:13.580 --> 57:16.997
Major, uh, what's his butt?
Garden party...

57:17.084 --> 57:18.709
Teegarden. Major Teegarden.

57:18.795 --> 57:22.579
Right. Asked me to go with Walden,
said she might need guns,...

57:22.674 --> 57:24.466
..so I said, you know, OK, why not?

57:24.552 --> 57:28.632
Grabbed me a saw, bungeed one of
the Huey doorways and away we went.

57:29.640 --> 57:31.384
Yeah.

57:31.475 --> 57:32.674
And, uh...

57:32.768 --> 57:34.512
..the captain was a big hero...

57:35.647 --> 57:38.318
She died tragically in the desert,
and Major...

57:38.401 --> 57:39.646
- Teegarden.
- Teegarden...

57:39.736 --> 57:42.273
..wants her to get the Medal of Honour,
so she’ll get it.

57:42.363 --> 57:44.321
When did the M-16 ammo run out?

57:45.825 --> 57:46.774
What?

57:46.868 --> 57:48.327
M-16 ammo?

57:48.412 --> 57:51.912
Blackhawk crew said
they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.

57:51.999 --> 57:53.660
When did it run out?

57:54.294 --> 57:56.831
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

57:56.921 --> 57:57.871
You wouldn't?

57:59.800 --> 58:01.877
As... as I recall, and, uh...

58:01.969 --> 58:03.464
..I'm not really sure,...

58:03.555 --> 58:06.556
..but the M-16 ammo
ran out first thing in the morning.

58:06.642 --> 58:09.393
First thing in the morning.
But you're not really sure?

58:11.646 --> 58:12.726
Now I'm confused.

58:12.814 --> 58:15.685
- You were there, weren't you?
- Affirmative, sir.

58:15.776 --> 58:17.603
But I was on the saw.

58:19.824 --> 58:21.317
AItameyer would know, sir.

58:21.408 --> 58:22.439
AItameyer?

58:22.534 --> 58:26.367
- Yes, sir. He was manning the M-16.
- Oh, I see. OK.

58:27.415 --> 58:29.075
OK, let's back up, then.

58:29.167 --> 58:30.330
Um,...

58:30.418 --> 58:32.744
..when that tank fired on your chopper,...

58:32.838 --> 58:34.415
..you said that, uh...

58:35.548 --> 58:39.547
..''You should go for altitude
and call for support'', right?

58:40.805 --> 58:41.920
Sir?

58:42.015 --> 58:43.807
You knew this wasn't Panama.

58:43.893 --> 58:46.893
Men were going to die,
so you wanted to get out, right?

58:46.978 --> 58:49.386
Wh... who told you that, sir?
Tea Party? llario?

58:49.481 --> 58:52.187
It doesn't matter who told me that.
You tell me.

58:59.826 --> 59:02.613
You don't want to know
what happened out there, sir.

59:02.704 --> 59:04.164
Yes, I do.

59:04.249 --> 59:06.918
You just want me to sign
off on the story...

59:07.002 --> 59:10.206
..so you can finish your job
and the lady can get her medal.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.084
Are you refusing to tell me?

59:14.176 --> 59:17.094
Colonel, you know
what to do if you get a hang fire...

59:17.180 --> 59:20.216
..when you pull the trigger
and the round doesn't go off?

59:20.308 --> 59:24.686
You wait, with your weapon pointed in a
safe direction, cos the primer burns slow.

59:24.772 --> 59:27.442
You open your weapon
and take the round out,...

59:27.525 --> 59:28.984
..it blows up in your face.

59:30.528 --> 59:32.901
Leave this round in the chamber, Colonel.

59:37.661 --> 59:39.986
I work at the Pentagon, Sergeant,...

59:40.080 --> 59:42.916
..so I admit I'm a Little
slow on the uptake.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.788
Otherwise I'd say you just threatened me.

59:48.091 --> 59:50.131
Did you just threaten me, soldier?

59:51.677 --> 59:54.465
Because, if you did,
let me respond to you.

01:00:00.187 --> 01:00:02.227
Let me respond to you this way.

01:00:04.024 --> 01:00:07.643
I'm an officer, and therefore,
by proclamation, a gentleman,...

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.280
..but don't abuse that, son.

01:00:09.865 --> 01:00:13.911
Don't get in my cross hairs,
because I’ll have no compunction...

01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:16.782
..about getting up to my neck in your ass,
understand?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.536
She was afraid, Colonel.

01:00:22.629 --> 01:00:26.462
That's the bottom line on Captain Walden.
She was a fucking coward, sir.

01:00:30.805 --> 01:00:32.633
Get me around so I can fire!

01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:41.190
- Go back. Let me have another shot!
- I don't know.

01:00:41.276 --> 01:00:43.564
I'm going for altitude, call for support.

01:00:43.653 --> 01:00:44.566
There's no time!

01:00:46.198 --> 01:00:47.609
All right, one more!

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:50.784
But then I'm calling for support.

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:54.536
Unhook the aux fuel cells!
Prepare to toss them overboard.

01:00:54.624 --> 01:00:56.035
llario, get me the flare gun.

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:57.953
So it was your idea to use the fuel cell?

01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.160
Yeah.

01:00:59.254 --> 01:01:00.749
Me, Rady, somebody.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.790
Adrenaline was pumping. You can't
expect me to remember everything.

01:01:04.886 --> 01:01:06.084
Try.

01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:09.514
Now!

01:01:13.187 --> 01:01:15.180
- Yay!
- Whoo!

01:01:16.316 --> 01:01:18.724
So what happened during the night?

01:01:18.819 --> 01:01:20.396
Walden and llario,...

01:01:20.487 --> 01:01:23.607
..they wouldn't shut up
about being rescued.

01:01:25.326 --> 01:01:27.698
Like the Army had nothing else to do.

01:01:27.787 --> 01:01:29.780
Dust is blowing hard out there.

01:01:29.873 --> 01:01:33.787
- Think they’ll find us tonight?
- AWACS lost us when the ADT got hit.

01:01:33.876 --> 01:01:36.499
SOP is for search and rescue
to begin looking...

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:38.546
Christ, Captain, are you crying?

01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:40.258
It's OK. It's just tension.

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:43.095
Hey, you're going to be OK, OK?

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.007
They’ll find us. It’ll be OK.

01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:48.966
I can hear the rag heads moving,
as soon as you girls stop gabbing.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:06.872
They're going away.

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.332
It was just a probe.

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:10.706
- Shit!
- I'm OK.

01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:12.621
- [Monfriez] I took one.
- How's Rady?

01:02:12.713 --> 01:02:15.286
Hanging in. Captain?

01:02:16.425 --> 01:02:19.000
Ah! Oh!

01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:24.759
So the rest of the night
went without incident?

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.683
Yeah.

01:02:27.772 --> 01:02:29.681
Wasn't that enough for one night?

01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:32.857
You want to continue this tomorrow?

01:02:35.364 --> 01:02:37.522
I don't get emotional about this shit.

01:02:37.616 --> 01:02:39.241
I've been there, you know?

01:02:40.745 --> 01:02:42.655
OK. Go on.

01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:45.833
Well, after the firefight,
we argued mainly.

01:02:45.918 --> 01:02:50.710
llario was freaked out by the dark, and
Walden wanted to surrender at first light.

01:02:51.507 --> 01:02:55.458
She was a wreck, kept asking about
the ammo, worrying we didn't have enough.

01:02:55.553 --> 01:02:57.428
I knew they'd attack at dawn.

01:02:59.391 --> 01:03:02.429
So what happened during the evacuation?

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.558
Evacuation.

01:03:09.904 --> 01:03:11.446
All right, let's go.

01:03:11.531 --> 01:03:12.859
There's the rescue.

01:03:16.577 --> 01:03:19.033
AItameyer, give me a hand with Rady.

01:03:20.665 --> 01:03:22.124
- Come on, Captain!
- Ow!

01:03:22.209 --> 01:03:23.159
Come on!

01:03:23.253 --> 01:03:24.332
- No! Don't move me!
- Get away!

01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:25.535
Suck it up!

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:27.956
I got you covered! Ready?

01:03:30.635 --> 01:03:31.750
Go! Go! Go!

01:03:34.014 --> 01:03:36.588
- llario, move!
- Not without the Captain!

01:03:36.684 --> 01:03:38.013
I’ll get her.

01:03:38.102 --> 01:03:40.428
No! I'm not leaving!

01:03:40.522 --> 01:03:43.012
I'm not leaving! It's not safe!

01:03:43.107 --> 01:03:45.944
They're taking fire!
The choppers are waiting!

01:03:46.028 --> 01:03:47.653
No! No! No!

01:03:58.083 --> 01:03:59.875
Get the fuck outta here!

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:03.999
Come on!

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.129
She fired at you?

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.547
Near us, yeah.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:13.134
Then why did you lie to the investigators
about how she performed?

01:04:14.936 --> 01:04:18.804
They'd already put together
their own bullshit version of the story...

01:04:18.899 --> 01:04:23.276
..before they talked to me. I told them
what they wanted to hear. We all did.

01:04:23.362 --> 01:04:26.389
But that's the truth, so
forget about the medal,

01:04:26.402 --> 01:04:29.069
or leave it as it is.
I don't give a fuck.

01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:33.622
So nobody from your Huey crew
fired an M-16 any time during the rescue?

01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:35.332
That's affirmed, sir.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.793
Monfriez, you ready?

01:04:40.298 --> 01:04:41.757
You sure about that?

01:04:41.842 --> 01:04:44.511
That's affirmative, sir.

01:04:44.595 --> 01:04:46.219
We had no ammo.

01:04:51.979 --> 01:04:53.354
So how about it, Colonel?

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:55.396
Want to go a few rounds?

01:04:55.483 --> 01:04:57.606
Are you threatening me, soldier?

01:04:57.694 --> 01:05:00.101
- Where's your brain bucket?
- I don't need it.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.856
Don't step in here without one.

01:05:01.948 --> 01:05:06.741
I have to tell you again,
you won't have a head to stick it on.

01:05:06.828 --> 01:05:09.664
Come on, Jersey. Right here.

01:05:09.748 --> 01:05:11.124
Let's see what you got.

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:13.083
You got nothing, man.

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:15.706
Come on!

01:05:25.975 --> 01:05:28.182
- [Meredith] Hello.
- Hello? Baby?

01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:29.598
How're you doing?

01:05:29.687 --> 01:05:31.396
Hi.

01:05:34.611 --> 01:05:36.355
How's it going?

01:05:36.446 --> 01:05:37.821
Outstanding.

01:05:39.073 --> 01:05:40.272
Outstanding.

01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:43.072
I was calling, I wondered...

01:05:43.162 --> 01:05:44.442
What... what kind of...

01:05:44.538 --> 01:05:46.496
What size T-shirts the kids wear?

01:05:46.582 --> 01:05:48.622
I want to get the kids some T-shirts.

01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:52.917
You know their sizes as well as I do.

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:54.916
Are you OK?

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.417
Nat?

01:05:59.597 --> 01:06:02.267
I got a pint of, um...

01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:04.556
..Scotch here in a paper bag.

01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:08.222
I don't want to drink any of it.

01:06:10.317 --> 01:06:12.476
Can you tell me why you need it?

01:06:18.911 --> 01:06:21.533
Want me to prattle on for a minute?
I can do that.

01:06:21.622 --> 01:06:22.571
[Nat] Please.

01:06:22.665 --> 01:06:25.536
OK. Um...

01:06:25.627 --> 01:06:27.121
The new refrigerator doesn't work.

01:06:27.212 --> 01:06:29.537
The light doesn't come on
when you open the door.

01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:34.709
I had to drive all the way
over to Wagner, 12 blocks,...

01:06:34.803 --> 01:06:37.721
..just so that Brian could practice
riding his bike.

01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:40.134
He's afraid of falling
in front of his friends.

01:06:41.978 --> 01:06:45.562
He refuses to let anyone
see him riding with training wheels.

01:06:47.151 --> 01:06:51.232
They've both taken to sleeping in our bed
since you left.

01:06:52.616 --> 01:06:55.071
It's like sleeping between two tornadoes.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.903
I better go, baby.

01:06:56.995 --> 01:06:58.406
Don Boylar called.

01:06:58.497 --> 01:06:59.909
Jesus.

01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:02.496
I better go.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:05.124
- Nat, talk to me.
- I can't.

01:07:05.214 --> 01:07:06.756
- Why not?
- I can't!

01:07:06.841 --> 01:07:08.916
Bullshit. Bull! Talk to me!

01:07:16.727 --> 01:07:18.221
Oh, Christ.

01:07:19.647 --> 01:07:20.595
Colonel?

01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:22.149
Colonel?

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.866
Can we get some coffee, please?

01:07:37.124 --> 01:07:38.702
You're not a happy man.

01:07:40.045 --> 01:07:42.536
A woman? The Army?

01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:43.747
AI Bathra?

01:07:55.646 --> 01:07:57.390
Talk to me.

01:07:57.482 --> 01:07:59.272
Off the record, if you want.

01:07:59.358 --> 01:08:00.769
Way, way off the record.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.354
Rangers' honour.

01:08:04.864 --> 01:08:05.897
Serling,...

01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:09.596
How long you been back?

01:08:11.605 --> 01:08:12.850
Six months.

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:15.513
And you...
you've been in the service how long?

01:08:15.609 --> 01:08:16.890
17 years.

01:08:16.986 --> 01:08:20.319
Ah, they got me running this inquiry...

01:08:20.406 --> 01:08:23.194
..on this girl pilot.

01:08:23.285 --> 01:08:24.779
Captain Karen Walden.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:29.332
She’ll be the first woman
to get the Medal of Honour for combat.

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:30.247
Oh, boy.

01:08:30.335 --> 01:08:33.917
And everybody in the beltway
wants a piece of this one, right?

01:08:35.424 --> 01:08:37.879
I just want to get something clear.

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.638
This time, just want
somebody to be a hero.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.805
I want to get something right.

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:44.840
Yeah.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:47.508
Cos AI Bathra, you know...

01:08:52.818 --> 01:08:53.767
AI Bathra.

01:08:53.861 --> 01:08:55.854
You talked to Boylar's parents?

01:08:55.947 --> 01:08:57.062
Yeah.

01:08:57.157 --> 01:08:58.734
Do they know?

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:02.069
They heard from a few of his friends.

01:09:02.162 --> 01:09:05.247
Aw, Jesus...

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:06.363
You know...

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:11.170
They told Boylar's parents
he died from enemy fire.

01:09:11.256 --> 01:09:13.048
I told them that.

01:09:13.134 --> 01:09:16.419
I carried the message,
went to the funeral,...

01:09:16.511 --> 01:09:18.968
..watched his mother cry her eyes out.

01:09:19.057 --> 01:09:21.892
I stood there
and looked his father in the eye...

01:09:21.977 --> 01:09:25.477
..and told him
his son died brave under fire.

01:09:25.564 --> 01:09:28.898
And I was the one
who gave the order to fire.

01:09:28.984 --> 01:09:30.526
I did it.

01:09:30.611 --> 01:09:33.613
Then the Army gave me a medal...

01:09:33.698 --> 01:09:35.941
..for bravery and valor.

01:09:37.453 --> 01:09:40.158
Then they buried me...

01:09:40.247 --> 01:09:41.624
..in medals.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:45.160
Got a sense of humour, don't they?

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.210
Yeah.

01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:56.297
Can't remember anything else
except being in the Army.

01:09:57.809 --> 01:10:01.558
Either being in it or wanting to be in it.

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.395
It's all I know.

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:13.783
Look, you need to sleep.

01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:15.150
You call me any time.

01:10:15.246 --> 01:10:19.327
Anything you want to say about anything,
on or off the record.

01:10:20.794 --> 01:10:23.166
I'm going to leave you alone for a while.

01:10:29.387 --> 01:10:34.428
llario. Are you saying you can't find him,
or that he's absent without leave?

01:10:34.517 --> 01:10:36.391
[Man] Sir, that’s an I... I...

01:10:36.478 --> 01:10:38.306
That's right, specialist llario.

01:10:38.398 --> 01:10:40.355
Well, we contacted the MPs, sir...

01:10:40.442 --> 01:10:42.518
Roger.

01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:44.153
Roger that.

01:10:44.321 --> 01:10:46.113
Thank you.

01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:50.860
Did she display fear when she had
to make these life-and-death decisions?

01:10:50.953 --> 01:10:53.527
[llario] No, never.

01:10:53.623 --> 01:10:56.790
Karen,... the captain...
she had this quality.

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:58.835
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:03.085
And she... you know, she put up
with a lot of shit to become an officer.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:07.680
Had to work twice as hard
as everybody else, be twice as good.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:11.264
She’d never let the guard down,
show any sign of weakness.

01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:14.555
But she was tough. She could handle it.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:18.063
So, ladies and gentlemen,
what I have to say to you in closing...

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.978
..is to go forth,...

01:11:20.069 --> 01:11:22.277
..to command wisely,...

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:24.156
..to advise prudently,...

01:11:24.242 --> 01:11:26.364
..to protect with vigilance...

01:11:26.452 --> 01:11:28.908
..and to judge with care.

01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:31.322
And above all,...

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:34.916
..to defend with all your heart,
all your soul...

01:11:35.004 --> 01:11:36.961
..and all your courage...

01:11:37.048 --> 01:11:41.092
..the lives of the men and women
under your command,...

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:43.467
..and the United States of America.

01:11:45.599 --> 01:11:49.348
Are you now saying you’ll report
against her getting the medal?

01:11:49.437 --> 01:11:53.185
As I explained to the White House,
there should be a further investigation...

01:11:53.274 --> 01:11:54.982
..before we move forward.
The discrepancies...

01:11:55.068 --> 01:11:57.986
Another matter completely.
Write up a second report.

01:11:58.071 --> 01:11:59.614
That's my point, sir!

01:11:59.698 --> 01:12:02.071
llario's disappeared. Altameyer's missing.

01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:04.733
- Who?
- AItameyer, sir. Walden's crew chief.

01:12:04.829 --> 01:12:06.739
VA hospital's transferred him out
three weeks ago.

01:12:06.832 --> 01:12:08.456
Paperwork's missing.

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:10.001
Doesn't he have any family?

01:12:10.085 --> 01:12:11.081
Negative.

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:12.914
Fucking VA. We can't wait, Nat.

01:12:13.005 --> 01:12:16.256
You cannot imagine
the kind of heat I'm getting on this.

01:12:16.343 --> 01:12:17.884
Everybody wants it.

01:12:17.969 --> 01:12:23.046
Senators, congressmen, one shiny piece
of something for people to believe in.

01:12:24.226 --> 01:12:25.508
Whole episode.

01:12:25.604 --> 01:12:27.181
Walden or AI Bathra?

01:12:27.272 --> 01:12:28.815
Both, damn it, both.

01:12:29.607 --> 01:12:30.888
Submit your report today.

01:12:31.026 --> 01:12:32.057
I'm sorry, sir.

01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:36.734
I won't put my name
on an incomplete report.

01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:40.657
May I remind you who recommended you
for this when no-one else touch you?

01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:43.699
You saying you chose me
because I wouldn't rock the boat?

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.492
Dereliction of duty,
drunk and disorderly, conduct unbecoming.

01:12:47.587 --> 01:12:49.129
At best, a dishonorable discharge.

01:12:49.214 --> 01:12:52.298
At worst, AI Bathra gives us
plenty of grounds, if we want 'em.

01:12:52.384 --> 01:12:55.337
At least somebody has finally said it.

01:12:55.428 --> 01:12:59.427
Nat, don't do this. I could give you
a direct order to submit your report.

01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:00.797
Yes, you could.

01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:11.774
Put Hillerman back on the Walden file!

01:13:11.906 --> 01:13:15.192
I handed this to you, Nat, as a way back.

01:13:15.285 --> 01:13:17.492
You could've had one hell of a career.

01:13:19.039 --> 01:13:21.327
And you give Meredith my best.

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:23.575
Tell her I didn't have any choice.

01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:27.204
I'm going to finish this report.

01:13:27.298 --> 01:13:28.840
On my own, if I have to.

01:13:28.925 --> 01:13:32.295
I'm going to get this one right.

01:13:44.193 --> 01:13:45.473
You want one?

01:13:45.569 --> 01:13:47.063
No, thank you.

01:13:47.153 --> 01:13:52.494
Why is it people never want to eat
when they got something important to say?

01:13:52.577 --> 01:13:54.950
I always want to eat.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:01.037
Need you to help me find somebody.

01:14:01.128 --> 01:14:02.706
You want my help?

01:14:02.797 --> 01:14:05.668
Yeah.
Name's AItameyer. Steven AItameyer.

01:14:06.593 --> 01:14:10.841
He was the crew chief on the medevac
chopper, piloted by Karen Walden.

01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:14.431
- One supposed to get a Medal of Honour?
- The very one.

01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:17.025
The Army's usually
tidy about its people.

01:14:17.038 --> 01:14:19.098
Yeah, usually,
but not this time.

01:14:20.192 --> 01:14:24.060
First he demobbed,
then they had him in a VA hospital.

01:14:24.155 --> 01:14:27.274
They transferred him.
Now no-one can find him.

01:14:27.366 --> 01:14:29.110
Why do you need me?

01:14:29.202 --> 01:14:31.824
Can't someone in the Pentagon help?

01:14:31.913 --> 01:14:33.705
I'm out of the loop.

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.665
Somebody pissed at you?

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:41.000
- I'm out of the loop.
- Somebody important?

01:14:41.091 --> 01:14:43.712
- You want to help me or not?
- Hey, who called who here?

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:47.925
Yeah, sure, I’ll help.

01:14:48.015 --> 01:14:50.092
Just tell me why I'm doing it.

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:53.636
When you go after stories,
you want them to be right, yes?

01:14:53.729 --> 01:14:54.678
Yeah.

01:14:54.772 --> 01:14:55.804
So do I.

01:14:56.858 --> 01:14:58.437
OK.

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:02.147
So, I help you find this AItameyer,...

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.647
..and in return...?

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.084
There's a tape.

01:15:14.295 --> 01:15:16.786
Sweet Jesus. There's always a tape.

01:15:16.881 --> 01:15:18.921
- D'you want to hear this?
- Yeah.

01:15:19.009 --> 01:15:20.552
Yeah, go on.

01:15:20.678 --> 01:15:26.219
There's a tape of all communications
between our tanks that night in AI Bathra.

01:15:26.518 --> 01:15:29.188
Are they trying to make it disappear?

01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:33.399
I don't think so, but they're not
advertising its existence, either.

01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:34.764
The Army and its image.

01:15:39.282 --> 01:15:41.905
Where do I reach you
when I find this AItameyer?

01:15:42.078 --> 01:15:43.488
The Bethesda Arms.

01:15:43.579 --> 01:15:44.528
A motel?

01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:48.536
- Bet everything's great in your life.
- Outstanding.

01:15:48.626 --> 01:15:50.204
Serling,...

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:51.789
..eat something.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.588
You look awful.

01:16:16.324 --> 01:16:18.531
[Karen] # Make me an angel

01:16:18.785 --> 01:16:22.236
# Flies from Montgomery

01:16:23.707 --> 01:16:26.626
# Make me a poster

01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:30.046
# From an old rodeo

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.170
# Just give me one thing

01:16:35.346 --> 01:16:39.178
# That I can hold on to

01:16:40.518 --> 01:16:44.054
# To believe in this living’

01:16:44.148 --> 01:16:46.058
# It's just a...

01:16:46.151 --> 01:16:49.270
# Hard way to go

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.025
# To believe in this living’

01:16:54.118 --> 01:16:55.316
# It's just a...

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:59.035
# Hard way

01:16:59.123 --> 01:17:02.207
# To go

01:17:10.387 --> 01:17:11.336
Hello.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:12.888
[Gartner] Found Altameyer.

01:17:13.181 --> 01:17:14.260
Got any complaints?

01:17:14.349 --> 01:17:15.547
Excuse me?

01:17:15.642 --> 01:17:17.884
Rashes, fatigue, bleeding gums,...

01:17:17.978 --> 01:17:21.312
..muscle and joint pain,
loss of weight, loss of appetite,...

01:17:21.399 --> 01:17:25.894
..insomnia, reactions to bright sunlight.
You name it, we're seeing it.

01:17:25.986 --> 01:17:27.860
I drink too much. Does that count?

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:29.692
Hell, we all drink too much.

01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:31.326
Here he is.

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:34.446
AItameyer, you want a shave?

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:38.459
Gentleman here to see you.
You want a shave?

01:17:38.543 --> 01:17:40.037
What's wrong with him?

01:17:40.128 --> 01:17:42.453
Abdominal cancer.
That's what's killing him.

01:17:42.547 --> 01:17:44.671
There's many things wrong with him.

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.843
He's never awake very long
with all the pain.

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.672
I’ll leave you two, then.

01:17:49.764 --> 01:17:51.009
Thank you.

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:55.013
How you doing, Steven?

01:17:56.397 --> 01:17:57.891
I'm Colonel Serling.

01:17:57.982 --> 01:17:59.358
Nat Serling.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:03.523
I want to talk to you
about Captain Karen Walden.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:08.485
They want to give her
the Medal of Honour,...

01:18:08.577 --> 01:18:12.327
..and I know
that you were there in AI Kufan with her.

01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:13.791
Roger?

01:18:16.003 --> 01:18:17.960
I was...

01:18:18.046 --> 01:18:19.327
..hit.

01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:20.965
In the back.

01:18:22.009 --> 01:18:23.172
Roger.

01:18:23.261 --> 01:18:25.419
But you were still able to get Rady out.

01:18:28.016 --> 01:18:29.297
Rady.

01:18:29.434 --> 01:18:30.762
Yeah.

01:18:30.852 --> 01:18:32.845
Good man Rady.

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:39.769
I was...

01:18:39.863 --> 01:18:41.406
..afraid.

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.447
I understand, son.

01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:48.986
That's OK. Take your time.

01:18:49.082 --> 01:18:50.362
She was afraid.

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:53.413
She... she was afraid.

01:18:53.503 --> 01:18:55.294
The Captain was afraid?

01:18:57.091 --> 01:18:58.502
Not...

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.215
..the Captain.

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:04.464
Who then? Was it Rady or llario?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.928
Was llario afraid?

01:19:08.103 --> 01:19:09.895
Me.

01:19:13.484 --> 01:19:16.189
Did... didn't tell.

01:19:17.532 --> 01:19:19.489
You didn't tell what, son?

01:19:22.078 --> 01:19:23.537
The major.

01:19:26.124 --> 01:19:27.998
Monfriez.

01:19:28.085 --> 01:19:29.912
You didn't tell the major Monfriez...

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:32.958
You...
you and Monfriez didn't tell the major?

01:19:33.049 --> 01:19:34.459
He...

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:36.756
..and then they...

01:19:38.513 --> 01:19:41.052
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major.

01:19:44.521 --> 01:19:46.560
You and Monfriez what, Steven?

01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:49.478
Oh, Jesus.

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.896
What? What is it?

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.978
Tell me son, please. What is it?

01:19:53.196 --> 01:19:54.062
Jesus.

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.105
What? What?

01:19:55.199 --> 01:19:56.479
The fire.

01:19:56.575 --> 01:19:59.446
- What? What fire?
- Oh, Jesus, the fire.

01:20:00.079 --> 01:20:00.862
What fire?

01:20:00.956 --> 01:20:02.236
The napalm fire?

01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:03.281
Jesus.

01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:05.783
- You see the napalm fire.
- Jesus.

01:20:05.878 --> 01:20:07.337
Tell me about the fire.

01:20:07.421 --> 01:20:10.838
You and Monfriez
didn't tell the major what about the fire?

01:20:11.092 --> 01:20:12.919
- Please, Jesus.
- Steven!

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.042
Jesus, please.

01:20:14.137 --> 01:20:16.462
Is it napalm fire? Steven?

01:20:16.598 --> 01:20:17.511
Please, Jesus.

01:20:17.599 --> 01:20:18.548
Jesus, please.

01:20:18.642 --> 01:20:19.757
Steven.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.930
Jesus.

01:20:23.023 --> 01:20:24.102
Please.

01:20:24.316 --> 01:20:25.893
Jesus.

01:20:26.151 --> 01:20:27.230
What's he doing?

01:20:27.319 --> 01:20:29.442
He's upping his meds. Self-medication.

01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:31.445
Well, can you get him to stop?

01:20:31.532 --> 01:20:34.070
I mean, I need to talk to him.

01:20:34.327 --> 01:20:36.818
Give him a break.
He's feeling no pain now.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:52.546
Left.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.588
Left.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:54.631
Left.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:55.674
Left.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.603
Get off my car, sir.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:06.768
Think you got
something to tell me, Sergeant.

01:21:06.864 --> 01:21:08.240
I called around.

01:21:08.324 --> 01:21:10.816
You're off this inquiry, so why you here?

01:21:10.911 --> 01:21:12.619
Karen Walden sent me.

01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:19.248
I just left AItameyer.

01:21:24.634 --> 01:21:27.553
What happened out there
that was so bad...

01:21:27.638 --> 01:21:32.549
..that it would have AItameyer
laying up in a hospital praying to die,...

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.683
..that's got llario on the run?

01:21:36.273 --> 01:21:37.981
That's right, he went AWOL.

01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:42.195
What do you think he’ll tell them
about you when they catch him?

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.188
And they're going to catch him, son.

01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:46.155
Now, you can tell them,...

01:21:46.242 --> 01:21:48.033
..or you can tell me.

01:21:49.079 --> 01:21:50.953
What happened out there?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.700
Nothing happened.

01:21:54.294 --> 01:21:56.202
Nothing happened, sir.

01:21:56.295 --> 01:21:58.703
It was a war.

01:22:02.052 --> 01:22:04.009
Don't lie to me, soldier.

01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:05.971
Don't lie to me.

01:22:07.308 --> 01:22:10.392
It doesn't matter
whether she gets this award or not.

01:22:10.477 --> 01:22:14.524
It doesn't matter whether I'm on this
inquiry or whether I'm in this Army.

01:22:14.608 --> 01:22:18.772
I'm going to find out the truth.
I guarantee you that.

01:22:18.863 --> 01:22:23.406
You said you were a good poker player.
Well, look me in the eye.

01:22:23.493 --> 01:22:25.117
You think I'm bluffing?

01:22:31.502 --> 01:22:32.879
No, thank you.

01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:35.672
You want it.

01:22:35.757 --> 01:22:39.921
I can smell how much you want it.
It's coming out of your pores.

01:22:46.144 --> 01:22:47.851
Tell me about the fire.

01:22:48.145 --> 01:22:49.688
I like trains.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.689
Since I was a kid.

01:22:52.776 --> 01:22:54.057
Big...

01:22:54.154 --> 01:22:55.149
Tough...

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:56.484
Iron.

01:22:56.573 --> 01:22:58.067
Used to be iron, anyway.

01:22:58.158 --> 01:23:00.391
When I got to boxing
pro, I was going to

01:23:00.404 --> 01:23:02.867
call myself Johnny ''Night
Train'' Monfriez.

01:23:02.955 --> 01:23:06.075
- Don't that have a nice ring to it?
- Very nice.

01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:09.121
Don't humour me, man.
Say it like you mean it.

01:23:09.212 --> 01:23:11.964
Don't humour me, either.
Tell me about the fire.

01:23:12.757 --> 01:23:14.584
Where's my other bottle?

01:23:18.765 --> 01:23:22.894
You ever kill anyone
at close range with a small arm, sir?

01:23:22.978 --> 01:23:24.770
It's messy.

01:23:33.406 --> 01:23:34.735
No.

01:23:34.824 --> 01:23:36.319
We're not talking...

01:23:36.409 --> 01:23:38.699
..one of your great big tank guns here.

01:23:38.787 --> 01:23:40.745
Oh, that's OK.

01:23:40.831 --> 01:23:42.705
I know what you did.

01:23:42.792 --> 01:23:44.334
Your own men.

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:46.626
Guys under your command.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.630
How'd it feel?

01:23:49.717 --> 01:23:51.091
Bad, right?

01:23:51.176 --> 01:23:52.670
Very bad, son.

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.757
Very bad.

01:23:56.807 --> 01:23:58.966
And you didn't even mean to kill them.

01:24:01.898 --> 01:24:03.855
I've been a good soldier.

01:24:04.984 --> 01:24:07.557
A good soldier.

01:24:10.865 --> 01:24:13.072
Listen to that whistle.

01:24:14.161 --> 01:24:16.734
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

01:24:17.998 --> 01:24:19.029
Say it.

01:24:20.084 --> 01:24:23.121
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

01:24:26.467 --> 01:24:27.878
Now get out.

01:24:28.177 --> 01:24:30.004
You don't want to do this, son.

01:24:30.095 --> 01:24:31.175
Let me help you.

01:24:31.263 --> 01:24:34.348
- It's too late.
- It's never too late. Look at me.

01:24:34.434 --> 01:24:37.803
Things get fucked up in war.
I don't care what happened to you.

01:24:37.896 --> 01:24:38.928
You can't do this.

01:24:39.022 --> 01:24:40.018
Wrong!

01:24:41.651 --> 01:24:43.809
I can't do anything else.

01:24:43.903 --> 01:24:47.949
Yes, you can. You can put the car
in reverse. Put the gun down.

01:24:48.033 --> 01:24:49.314
We can help each other.

01:24:51.495 --> 01:24:54.450
I don't want to lose another good soldier.

01:24:59.921 --> 01:25:01.961
I strongly urge you...

01:25:02.048 --> 01:25:04.256
..to dismount the vehicle, sir.

01:25:22.863 --> 01:25:24.441
Monfriez. Monfriez!

01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:42.343
Aah!

01:26:02.576 --> 01:26:03.856
[llario] imagine that.

01:26:03.952 --> 01:26:07.488
imagine not thinking
about the consequences.

01:26:07.582 --> 01:26:11.284
it’s not the doing shit that gets to you,
it’s the consequences.

01:26:12.004 --> 01:26:15.503
My folks used to have this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

01:26:15.591 --> 01:26:17.548
I still go there sometimes.

01:26:20.597 --> 01:26:24.429
Guess you told me about this place
so I'd know where to find you.

01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:26.593
It's beautiful.

01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:33.895
The MPs at Fort Stewart...

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:36.561
..found your stash in your locker.

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.913
Pretty ingenious place to keep it, huh?

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:47.573
Not if you wanted it to be found.

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:52.379
Where'd you hide the needle tracks?

01:26:52.632 --> 01:26:53.962
I, uh...

01:26:54.052 --> 01:26:57.137
I shoot up between my toes.

01:26:59.433 --> 01:27:01.058
Monfriez is dead.

01:27:01.185 --> 01:27:03.344
Killed himself.

01:27:03.646 --> 01:27:05.519
AItameyer is dying.

01:27:11.613 --> 01:27:13.155
Aren't we all?

01:27:14.241 --> 01:27:17.527
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.079
We're going down! Mayday!

01:27:19.163 --> 01:27:22.165
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.531
We're going down!

01:27:23.627 --> 01:27:25.038
We're going down!

01:27:26.672 --> 01:27:28.831
And the chopper went down?

01:27:28.925 --> 01:27:30.087
What happened next?

01:27:30.217 --> 01:27:34.547
What happened next isn't important.
It's what happened that night.

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:37.013
Monfriez wanted to make a run for it.

01:27:37.101 --> 01:27:39.972
At dawn we're dead.
They’ll have reinforcements.

01:27:40.063 --> 01:27:41.937
Escape and evasion, Captain.

01:27:43.775 --> 01:27:47.275
Now's the time to do it.
Maybe we'd slip by them in the dark.

01:27:47.404 --> 01:27:48.733
I told you,...

01:27:48.822 --> 01:27:50.566
..Rady can't be moved.

01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:51.814
Right, llario?

01:27:51.909 --> 01:27:55.657
That lung - any movement may kill him.
But he may die lying here.

01:27:55.746 --> 01:27:58.155
You see?
Rady will never make it. I say we go.

01:28:02.922 --> 01:28:04.582
Oh, great.

01:28:04.674 --> 01:28:06.632
Great. The Captain's crying.

01:28:06.718 --> 01:28:09.469
It's just tension, asshole.

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:13.006
It doesn't mean shit.

01:28:13.183 --> 01:28:16.268
Come on, Captain.
I don't want to wait here to die.

01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:21.223
llario?

01:28:24.822 --> 01:28:27.527
- I don't know.
- Come on, it's a majority.

01:28:27.617 --> 01:28:31.200
That'd be great if this was a democracy,
but it isn't.

01:28:31.496 --> 01:28:33.157
We stay with Rady.

01:28:33.999 --> 01:28:36.786
I wouldn't risk your life.
I won't risk his.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.582
So if we surrender,
the Iraqis would doctor him up.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.376
No surrender.

01:28:44.762 --> 01:28:46.304
I hear something moving.

01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:50.386
- I say we make for the chopper now.
- And I say I heard enough of that shit.

01:28:50.476 --> 01:28:53.347
You don't have to go.
We don't need your permission.

01:28:53.438 --> 01:28:55.347
I am in command here!

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.397
Well, maybe not any more.

01:29:01.738 --> 01:29:03.697
Give me the saw, Monfriez.

01:29:03.783 --> 01:29:08.031
I can't stop you from running, but
you're not taking our fire power with you.

01:29:09.957 --> 01:29:11.950
You're not taking away my weapon.

01:29:16.547 --> 01:29:18.339
Yes, I am.

01:29:19.592 --> 01:29:22.131
Hey, I can make a white flag, all right?

01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:25.390
There's no way
you're taking away my weapon, cunt.

01:29:25.474 --> 01:29:27.716
Section 28-J,...

01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:29.684
..code of military justice.

01:29:29.771 --> 01:29:31.052
Mutiny,...

01:29:31.147 --> 01:29:34.184
..an offence punishable by death.

01:29:38.488 --> 01:29:40.197
Jesus, Monfriez.

01:29:40.532 --> 01:29:43.285
Shut up! She's trying to get us killed!

01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.581
llario, who you with?

01:29:51.212 --> 01:29:54.628
Come on, llario, shithead,
do you want to die?

01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:00.971
Please, Captain.

01:30:04.476 --> 01:30:05.342
Oh!

01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:10.311
Unh.

01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:17.729
They're going away.

01:30:17.825 --> 01:30:19.284
It was just a probe.

01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:20.324
Oh.

01:30:20.412 --> 01:30:22.155
Shit.

01:30:22.247 --> 01:30:24.370
[Altameyer] Are you all right?

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.199
[Walden] Shit!

01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:27.784
Oh, my God.

01:30:27.879 --> 01:30:29.159
Oh, my God.

01:30:29.339 --> 01:30:30.204
Shit.

01:30:30.298 --> 01:30:32.968
I don't fucking believe it.

01:30:35.262 --> 01:30:36.923
Give me your weapon.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:39.506
Christ, I thought you were firing at me!

01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:56.322
You're wounded, ma'am. Let me see.

01:30:59.707 --> 01:31:00.952
You're with him.

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:03.450
You got to let me look at it.

01:31:05.046 --> 01:31:07.170
Christ, let him look at it!

01:31:07.257 --> 01:31:09.830
I gave birth to a nine-pound baby,...

01:31:09.926 --> 01:31:11.207
..asshole!

01:31:11.303 --> 01:31:13.178
I think I can handle it!

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:20.303
Cap, we got to get you out of here.

01:31:21.356 --> 01:31:23.349
We stay with Rady.

01:31:24.443 --> 01:31:27.195
- And then?
- And then...

01:31:45.259 --> 01:31:47.417
[Altameyer] Incoming!

01:31:47.552 --> 01:31:50.423
150 metres and closing!

01:31:52.266 --> 01:31:54.473
[Altameyer] 140!

01:31:55.979 --> 01:31:57.688
[Altameyer] 130!

01:31:57.982 --> 01:31:59.525
Give me my weapon!

01:31:59.609 --> 01:32:01.233
llario, how's Rady?

01:32:01.318 --> 01:32:03.311
- He's dead!
- No, he's alive!

01:32:04.322 --> 01:32:06.280
Come on, Captain, give him his weapon!

01:32:06.366 --> 01:32:09.284
- This is insane! Give me my weapon!
- Shut up!

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:11.244
90 metres and closing!

01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:12.872
80!

01:32:15.376 --> 01:32:16.704
I'm sorry.

01:32:21.217 --> 01:32:22.296
OK. OK.

01:32:22.385 --> 01:32:24.508
OK, we’ll get you out of here, Captain.

01:32:24.596 --> 01:32:26.089
It's all over.

01:32:26.305 --> 01:32:28.298
No, Monfriez,...

01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:30.300
..it's not over.

01:32:30.393 --> 01:32:31.888
There will be a reckoning.

01:32:31.978 --> 01:32:33.521
Count on it.

01:32:37.193 --> 01:32:39.315
Hey, what's that?

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:45.115
There's the rescue!

01:33:00.177 --> 01:33:01.340
Let's move it! Move it!

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:02.841
Move it! Move it!

01:33:03.098 --> 01:33:04.212
No!

01:33:04.307 --> 01:33:05.967
Wait.

01:33:06.059 --> 01:33:08.385
Help Rady.

01:33:09.438 --> 01:33:12.356
We're pinned down here!

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.207
llario, give me the M-16.

01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:31.419
Give me the goddamn M-16!

01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:49.978
I’ll cover you.

01:33:51.570 --> 01:33:52.566
Go!

01:33:54.156 --> 01:33:55.187
I’ll cover you!

01:33:55.282 --> 01:33:56.277
Negative, ma'am!

01:33:56.366 --> 01:33:59.985
Come back for me
with a stretcher and more guns!

01:34:00.079 --> 01:34:02.866
- Karen, please!
- Go! It's an order!

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:03.574
Karen, please!

01:34:03.833 --> 01:34:05.493
Go! Go!

01:34:35.327 --> 01:34:36.703
Wait!

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.285
Wait!

01:34:46.048 --> 01:34:47.458
Where's Walden?

01:34:47.799 --> 01:34:51.549
She's dead!

01:35:02.191 --> 01:35:05.146
No!

01:36:10.019 --> 01:36:13.020
Monfriez said she would
have court-martial led us.

01:36:15.233 --> 01:36:18.235
AItameyer was too fucked
up to say anything.

01:36:21.657 --> 01:36:22.772
She was...

01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:25.156
She was probably killed by small arms...

01:36:25.245 --> 01:36:27.653
..before the napalm ever hit.

01:36:29.625 --> 01:36:30.953
Either way,...

01:36:31.042 --> 01:36:34.127
..she never could have
survived that stomach wound.

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:37.249
You think that matters?

01:36:44.266 --> 01:36:45.809
No.

01:36:48.396 --> 01:36:49.559
No.

01:36:49.647 --> 01:36:51.272
Hmm.

01:37:09.712 --> 01:37:12.203
I couldn't bear to send this.

01:37:12.298 --> 01:37:14.587
Uh, I didn't even want to...

01:37:14.676 --> 01:37:17.214
I didn't even want to touch it.

01:37:17.304 --> 01:37:18.715
Uh...

01:37:33.698 --> 01:37:36.319
Can you get it to her parents for me?

01:37:39.329 --> 01:37:40.823
Can you...?

01:37:40.914 --> 01:37:42.077
Please?

01:37:44.085 --> 01:37:45.461
Yeah.

01:37:59.769 --> 01:38:02.639
Uh, listen,
I'm going to have to call you back.

01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:04.688
You got off the phone for me?

01:38:04.774 --> 01:38:07.445
- You’ll want me there for this.
- Meaning?

01:38:07.528 --> 01:38:11.693
Remember that stereo you told me not to
buy cos who needs a dual cassette deck?

01:38:11.783 --> 01:38:15.234
When does anyone ever have
a reason to copy a tape?

01:38:15.328 --> 01:38:17.701
Nat, just the man I wanted to see.

01:38:17.789 --> 01:38:20.245
Uh, do you know Colonel Serling?

01:38:20.334 --> 01:38:22.956
This is Tony Gartner
of the Washington Post.

01:38:23.046 --> 01:38:24.623
He was with the 9th in Vietnam.

01:38:24.714 --> 01:38:25.628
Mr. Gartner.

01:38:25.715 --> 01:38:26.878
Colonel.

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:28.461
Take a seat, Nat.

01:38:28.552 --> 01:38:31.672
He's following up
our investigation of AI Bathra,...

01:38:31.764 --> 01:38:36.474
..and it seems that he has a few questions
that he'd like to ask us.

01:38:36.561 --> 01:38:38.554
Let's give him every facility.

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:41.517
- I appreciate that.
- Some ground rules, though.

01:38:41.608 --> 01:38:44.978
I insist we be allowed to schedule
the release of all information...

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:47.359
..to the public regarding casualties.

01:38:47.448 --> 01:38:50.320
Well, I wish I could
accommodate you, sir,...

01:38:50.411 --> 01:38:53.650
..but, unfortunately,
we’ll be going with a

01:38:53.663 --> 01:38:56.912
story based on a tape
that I've acquired...

01:38:57.001 --> 01:39:00.501
..of all radio communications that night.

01:39:02.424 --> 01:39:04.416
So,...

01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:06.426
..I'd like you to listen...

01:39:06.511 --> 01:39:08.421
..and then comment for the record.

01:39:08.513 --> 01:39:10.424
I can't comment for the record.

01:39:10.517 --> 01:39:12.593
This is an ongoing investigation.

01:39:14.438 --> 01:39:16.930
[Serling] First right! Turn to the right!

01:39:17.024 --> 01:39:18.186
Sabre-6, this is Bobcat-5.

01:39:18.275 --> 01:39:21.479
Enemy tangos!
Say again! Enemy tanks in our lines. Over.

01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:24.774
[Boylar] Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta...

01:39:24.866 --> 01:39:28.282
- I don't think any more of this...
- This is what happened, General.

01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:31.371
[Serling] Liberty-6, this is Sabre-6.
Enemy tanks on our flank. Out!

01:39:31.456 --> 01:39:33.201
Patella, find me a target.

01:39:33.293 --> 01:39:36.792
- I think I got one, sir.
- Do you or do you not have a target?

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.790
It must be, sir. They’re firing at us.

01:39:38.882 --> 01:39:39.831
Loader!

01:39:39.925 --> 01:39:40.874
Up, sir!

01:39:40.968 --> 01:39:41.917
Fire!

01:39:42.011 --> 01:39:43.208
On the way!

01:39:43.303 --> 01:39:45.095
- Target! We got that sucker!
- Yeah!

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:48.716
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
Repeat, we just lost Boylar.

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.388
Roger that, sir. We got him.

01:39:50.478 --> 01:39:53.349
- You just lit up a friendly.
- Roger that. We... What?

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.024
You just lit up a friendly, goddamn it!

01:39:57.111 --> 01:40:01.608
Cougar-6 was one of your own Abrams,
Colonel Serling. Is that correct?

01:40:03.952 --> 01:40:05.151
Yes, that's correct.

01:40:07.623 --> 01:40:11.122
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening?
Sabre-6, report.

01:40:11.293 --> 01:40:13.203
[Serling] Patella, was
that one of our tanks?

01:40:13.296 --> 01:40:13.960
They fired.

01:40:14.047 --> 01:40:16.041
At us or at the T-72s?

01:40:16.133 --> 01:40:17.129
I don',t know.

01:40:17.218 --> 01:40:20.089
- At us or at the T-72s, Patella?
- I don’t know!

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.180
Colonel Serling, report status now.

01:40:23.266 --> 01:40:24.677
They have range on us!

01:40:24.768 --> 01:40:28.018
All Sabre elements,
stop all tanks, turn on your lights.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:30.394
I say again,
stop all tanks and turn on your Lights.

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:32.855
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening out there?

01:40:34.987 --> 01:40:36.150
Load us up.

01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:39.984
Patella, find me a target.
Snap out of it. Find me a target.

01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:41.240
Patella, come on!

01:40:43.623 --> 01:40:45.248
- Target!
- We're up.

01:40:45.333 --> 01:40:47.621
- Lights on or off?
- Off.

01:40:49.504 --> 01:40:50.915
- Fire!
- On the way.

01:40:54.843 --> 01:40:55.875
- Sir?
- Fire!

01:41:02.144 --> 01:41:04.469
Colonel Serling, report status now!

01:41:04.563 --> 01:41:07.980
Sabre-6, situation under control, General.

01:41:09.944 --> 01:41:14.855
General, Colonel Serling's order
to activate Lights,...

01:41:14.949 --> 01:41:18.615
..was that a standard response
to enemy infiltration of the lines?

01:41:19.955 --> 01:41:22.033
At the critical moment,...

01:41:22.125 --> 01:41:24.664
..in spite of terrible losses,...

01:41:24.754 --> 01:41:27.873
..Colonel Serling didn't hesitate to act.

01:41:27.965 --> 01:41:30.634
Ordering those tanks
to turn on their Lights...

01:41:30.718 --> 01:41:33.969
..saved the lives
of God knows how many of our men.

01:41:34.055 --> 01:41:36.262
Heroic acts arise...

01:41:36.349 --> 01:41:38.508
..out of desperate circumstances.

01:41:38.602 --> 01:41:43.644
I have no trouble at all
believing that Colonel Serling is a hero.

01:41:43.733 --> 01:41:45.809
Like Captain Karen Walden.

01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:49.486
Did you know, Mr. Gartner, for the first
time a woman is being considered...

01:41:49.573 --> 01:41:52.028
..for the Medal of Honour
for her performance under fire?

01:41:52.117 --> 01:41:53.944
And, um,...

01:41:54.036 --> 01:41:56.278
..Colonel Serling...

01:41:56.372 --> 01:41:59.373
..is just finishing up the inquiry.

01:41:59.459 --> 01:42:01.368
How's that going, Nat?

01:42:08.553 --> 01:42:10.261
I think, uh,...

01:42:13.642 --> 01:42:18.518
..in order to honour
a soldier like Karen Walden,...

01:42:18.605 --> 01:42:21.726
..we have to tell the truth, General,...

01:42:21.817 --> 01:42:24.060
..about what happened over there.

01:42:26.657 --> 01:42:30.109
The whole, hard,...

01:42:30.202 --> 01:42:32.954
..cold truth.

01:42:33.039 --> 01:42:36.539
And until we do that, uh,...

01:42:36.626 --> 01:42:39.794
..we dishonor her...

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.206
..and every soldier who died,...

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:45.051
..who gave their life for their country.

01:43:07.245 --> 01:43:09.570
My full report, General.

01:43:14.795 --> 01:43:18.212
Few of us are given the opportunity,...

01:43:18.299 --> 01:43:21.005
..even fewer the courage,...

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:26.634
..to sacrifice ourselves
for the lives of our comrades.

01:43:26.725 --> 01:43:29.726
In daily life, even as in battle,...

01:43:29.812 --> 01:43:35.436
..each one of us is mysteriously
and irrevocably bound to our fellow man.

01:43:35.944 --> 01:43:37.107
And yet,...

01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:41.273
..it is only in death
that the power of this bond...

01:43:41.534 --> 01:43:44.239
..is finally tested and proven.

01:43:45.747 --> 01:43:48.617
And who among us really knows...

01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:52.043
..how he might respond
when that moment comes?

01:44:24.208 --> 01:44:27.327
[Man] I guess we've been expecting you.

01:44:27.419 --> 01:44:31.369
Ahem. First of all, let me, um...

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:33.838
Let me just say that, uh,...

01:44:33.927 --> 01:44:36.004
..there was nothing that, uh,...

01:44:38.183 --> 01:44:40.638
..Tom and I wouldn't do for each other.

01:44:40.935 --> 01:44:42.643
Nothing.

01:44:42.937 --> 01:44:45.725
He was a good soldier.

01:44:45.815 --> 01:44:48.307
He was like a brother to me.

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:53.189
That night, uh, 25 February...

01:44:55.367 --> 01:44:57.907
..there were enemy tanks in our lines.

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:03.243
We thought...

01:45:06.631 --> 01:45:09.751
I... I thought that, uh,...

01:45:09.843 --> 01:45:13.343
..Tom's tank was an enemy tank.

01:45:16.893 --> 01:45:18.516
And, uh,...

01:45:25.444 --> 01:45:27.900
..I gave the order to fire.

01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:34.160
God help me.

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:35.823
I, um...

01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:40.577
Yeah, I killed him.

01:45:46.259 --> 01:45:48.336
As for the funeral,...

01:45:50.264 --> 01:45:52.506
..the lies the Army told...

01:45:54.853 --> 01:45:58.102
..and the lies that I told...

01:46:00.275 --> 01:46:02.898
..to you, I can only...

01:46:05.866 --> 01:46:07.859
..beg for your forgiveness.

01:46:13.874 --> 01:46:15.950
As far as the...

01:46:18.296 --> 01:46:20.419
As far as that night, um,...

01:46:22.925 --> 01:46:24.800
..I guess there's no way that, uh,...

01:46:24.887 --> 01:46:27.295
..I can even begin to
ask you to forgive me.

01:46:29.309 --> 01:46:31.931
I know that,...

01:46:32.187 --> 01:46:36.434
..but it's a burden
you're going to have to put down sometime.

01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.525
Thank you, sir.

01:47:06.934 --> 01:47:08.311
Mr. President.

01:47:39.263 --> 01:47:40.923
[Karen] Dear Mom and Dad,...

01:47:41.015 --> 01:47:44.467
..well, this is it - the big push.

01:47:44.561 --> 01:47:47.598
Looks like it's gonna really happen.

01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:49.350
And I'm afraid,...

01:47:49.441 --> 01:47:51.316
..not of being hurt or killed,...

01:47:51.403 --> 01:47:54.902
..well, kind of, but not much.

01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:58.940
My only regret will be
to never see you two again...

01:47:59.036 --> 01:48:01.362
..and that I’ll never
see Anne Marie grow up.

01:48:01.455 --> 01:48:04.871
But I know she's in good hands, the best.

01:48:04.959 --> 01:48:10.001
What I'm really afraid of is that
I might let my people down, my crew.

01:48:10.090 --> 01:48:14.255
These people depend on me.
They put their lives in my hands.

01:48:14.346 --> 01:48:17.051
I just can't fall 'em.

01:48:47.466 --> 01:48:49.423
Now, I know if you get this letter...

01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:51.004
..it means I'm dead.

01:48:51.095 --> 01:48:53.384
I only hope that I've made you proud,...

01:48:53.473 --> 01:48:55.430
..that I did my job,...

01:48:55.517 --> 01:48:57.391
..and I didn't let down my country,...

01:48:57.477 --> 01:49:00.395
..my crew, my fellow soldiers.

01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:02.390
I Love you guys.

01:49:02.483 --> 01:49:06.398
Never stop telling Anne Marie
how much I Love her.

01:49:06.488 --> 01:49:09.488
Your daughter, Karen.

01:49:37.689 --> 01:49:39.600
You got it? All right.
