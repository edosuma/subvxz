WEBVTT

03:49.479 --> 03:52.314
So, how are things going with you?

03:52.398 --> 03:55.651
Well, everything was going great
till they opened that Ta-Ta's next door.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.779
They've been taking a lot of my business,
some of my best girls.

03:58.821 --> 04:03.367
But the district manager got paralyzed
from bad shellfish.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.495
-Guess who's next in line.
-l think l'm getting a little bored.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.998
-Guess who stopped by yesterday.
-Who?

04:10.458 --> 04:13.877
-Mrs. Silverman and her son.
-Tom. Hey, how is Tom?

04:13.962 --> 04:17.505
Good, good.
He was with his beautiful pregnant wife.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.382
ls that so?

04:19.509 --> 04:23.345
You don't really have
a beautiful pregnant wife.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.013
Nope. Sure don't.

04:25.431 --> 04:29.351
You don't even have a bastard child
with an ugly woman out of wedlock.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.563
Mom, he's paralyzed. That means l'm next.

04:34.065 --> 04:38.360
Okay? That means l'm district manager.
Things around here are gonna change.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.530
Just like they were going to change
when you became restaurant manager.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.366
Goodbye.

04:53.376 --> 04:58.046
Look, honey, l care about you way too much
to let you work there,

04:58.089 --> 05:01.383
-so l'm gonna have to put my foot down.
-Cool. You do that.

05:01.467 --> 05:06.388
Allison, listen, l don't want you
to be groped inappropriately, except by me.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.518
-Come on. lt's a gateway job.
-Yeah.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.105
What the fuck?

05:15.189 --> 05:17.232
You'll be working a stripper pole
within a year!

05:19.027 --> 05:22.404
You're gonna be a young mother,
with lots of dollars in your pooswah!

05:39.213 --> 05:42.674
-What's up, stranger?
-Oh, my God! Hi!

05:43.134 --> 05:45.552
Hi, honey. Baby doll. Oh, my gosh.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.765
-So, today's the big day, huh?
-Yeah. l finally took the plunge.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.308
Well, do you want the grand tour?

05:51.392 --> 05:52.559
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.687
l've never worked in a place like this before.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.774
-You'll be fine. Yeah.
-Yeah?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.233
-Come on.
-Okay.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.770
-Hey, Josh.
-Hey.

06:38.106 --> 06:41.733
-Man, you look like unshaven shit.
-Thank you, Amber. Thanks.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.485
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.571
lt's not nothing. l'm haunted.
Every night, l have the same weeds dream.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.864
Everything starts off great,

06:47.949 --> 06:49.908
and then l get set, like,
four tables all at once.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.119
-Hey, there, folks. Good to see you.
-l'll have a Pepsi.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.037
-Okay, Pepsi.
-She'll have a sweet tea.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.289
Sweet tea. How about raspberry tea?
ls that all right?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.916
How about no?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
-Hot tea.
-Okay, hot tea.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.670
We're catching a movie, so we need you
to rush our order, okay?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.713
-Excuse me!
-Just one second.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.841
-Yes?
-What's your fish of the day?

07:05.883 --> 07:06.883
We don't have a fish of the day.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.010
-Did l say decaf? Did l remember...
-Yeah.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.637
We haven't looked at the menu yet.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.305
lf l get the salad bar with my steak...

07:13.516 --> 07:15.600
What is that, German?
l need a steak well-done!

07:15.852 --> 07:19.062
-The printer ran out of ink.
-Whatever.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.982
We had a problem in the kitchen.
All the orders were deleted, okay?

07:22.024 --> 07:24.651
-Oh, my God.
-Are you kidding me?

07:25.486 --> 07:28.864
-What's the fish of the day?
-l want the salad bar.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.199
And then l end up naked
in front of the entire restaurant.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.868
You're a vagina.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.122
-You've just been working too hard.
-Whatever.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.465
Hey!

07:46.549 --> 07:49.843
Miguel, that's more than three ounces
of cheese, my friend.

07:49.886 --> 07:54.097
We talked about this before.
Less queso. More listen-o.

08:00.271 --> 08:04.900
Okay, Allison. All right. First thing
we need to do is get you an outfit.

08:05.401 --> 08:10.697
Okay? Sizes are small, extra-small,
and extra-extra-small.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.409
Extra-small?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.411
All right, then you probably want to wear
an extra-extra-small,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.371
'cause management likes your ass
to hang out a little.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.582
And by a little, l mean a lot.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.171
Cute. No jewelry. Sorry.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.590
Yeah, management says
it makes you look trashy.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.593
-But...
-But they have approved nipple rings.

08:31.636 --> 08:36.389
l don't know if that helps.
You get 50% off food, except for desserts.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.809
l guess that's about it. Now, just saddle up.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
Cool.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.275
-Here? l'm... Now?
-Yeah.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.237
lf you have any questions about anything,
how to squeeze in anything...

08:50.279 --> 08:54.074
-You'll be right there.
-...tuck anything in or pull anything out.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.785
Yeah, l think l'm good. l think l'm good.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.621
Okay.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.541
Okay, Miguel,

09:03.292 --> 09:05.585
if you're gonna step up
and work under me on Friday night,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.587
-you gotta keep your cool, okay?
-Yes, ese.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.507
All right, fry is the hardest part of the job
during the rush,

09:10.591 --> 09:14.970
because we also have to do all the toasting,
and all the fucking French onion soups,

09:15.304 --> 09:18.515
which, as you can imagine,
is pretty time-consuming.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.016
Now, we get it all, okay?

09:20.101 --> 09:23.478
So, when the shit hits the fan,
and it's gonna hit the fan, Miguel,

09:24.355 --> 09:25.981
you better not freak out or something.
All right?

09:26.023 --> 09:28.400
-A lot of people can't hack this.
-Si, si. l know, ese.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.403
And you better have
a sense of humor tonight.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.823
Okay? lf l start screwing with you,
you know, just...

09:36.158 --> 09:38.994
Joking around or something like that,
or if you mess up and l call you on it,

09:39.078 --> 09:41.162
don't run off and pussy out
and start whining.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.959
You gotta have a pretty thick skin
if you want to work with me. Seriously.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.295
Sour cream Sanchez!

09:55.094 --> 09:56.678
He makes me laugh.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.370
Hey, Natasha.
You're looking sexier than a bag of tits.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.873
Thanks, Agnew. So are you.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.709
Are you still dating Allison,
or can you see other people?

10:28.377 --> 10:32.005
Who? No, l can... l can see whoever l want.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.383
Speaking of,
what time you getting off tonight?

10:35.426 --> 10:39.137
Actually, l'm getting off right now.
l'm not working tonight.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.056
Man, that sucks.

10:41.891 --> 10:46.144
'Cause wouldn't it be great
if we were getting off simultaneously?

10:46.520 --> 10:49.064
Don't worry. You'll get off soon enough.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.900
Okay, we get it.
You two want to fuck each other.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.654
Natasha, go be a whore elsewhere, okay?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.906
Agnew, go plot your next date rape
in the kitchen,

10:57.990 --> 11:00.408
-or your station's gonna be empty all night.
-Hello, Naomi.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.661
Hello, fuck boy.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.829
Hey. You got everything you need?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.083
Good one. All right.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.710
Hey, Hank. Heard you had
a little b-day shindig. How was?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.588
lt was all right, you know. Just a few peeps
over at the apartment complex.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.174
Any hot chickens there?
Or was it a pud party?

11:16.592 --> 11:18.176
There was a few cuties.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.595
-Amber and Kristy swung by. That was nice.
-Really?

11:21.931 --> 11:25.684
Well, sorry l couldn't make it.
l couldn't be invited.

11:31.774 --> 11:36.486
Listen, Hank, would you mind
pushing top shelf tonight?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.488
And go easy on the elbow.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.824
l got a bunch
of half-naked chicks next door,

11:40.908 --> 11:44.160
and they're hawking hot wings
and cameltoes.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.266
Hey, come here, little lady.
Where you going?

12:06.308 --> 12:09.894
-Give me a twirl. Very nice.
-Yeah.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.479
Very nice.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.316
Seriously, if l were still in my bi phase,
l would eat your ass like a sandwich.

12:15.776 --> 12:19.738
-What?
-Gotcha. l'm still in that bi phase.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.492
Raddimus, have you met Allison yet?

12:24.994 --> 12:26.828
How can l forget that?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.418
No, l don't think we've met.
l'm Raddimus. Hi.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.670
So, it's her first day, and l gotta jet.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.630
Could you show her
around the kitchen for me?

12:37.673 --> 12:38.673
Love to.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.842
-Thank you.
-Love to. Yeah.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.010
-Show them what you got.
-Okay.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.012
-Okay, baby.
-Okay.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.098
The grill's over there,
the freezer's over there,

12:47.183 --> 12:51.186
-and the pick-up area is right there.
-Great. Cool.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.563
Got that. Anything else l should know?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.231
No, not really.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.652
Oh, yeah. There is one thing.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.201
Did Haley tell you about this little game
we play around here?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.954
No.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.625
Okay. Let's play.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.669
l don't know.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.130
-We'll do a little stretching first.
-Jesus.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.840
Come on, baby.

13:20.883 --> 13:26.596
Call me crazy, l might be.
One time l fucked a tiger with my right knee.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.016
Suck a cow's tits. Suck a cow's tits.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.228
You can't suck her dick,
'cause a cow is a chick.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.564
-What's up, Nick?
-What's up, T-dawgie-dawgie-dawg?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.400
My name is Theo. Quit acting like that.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.861
Come on, nigga.
You always be my T-dawg, right?

13:42.154 --> 13:44.864
You know, white kids acting black,
that's so passé.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.909
Shit was passé when we did it. Let it go.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.037
Bitch.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.040
The next position is called the clitar.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.835
You take your panties...
Now, are you left-handed or right-handed?

13:57.378 --> 14:00.296
-Right. Right-handed.
-Right on.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.340
So then you go, right, baby,

14:02.424 --> 14:06.719
and then you just start jamming
like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.558
Raddimus!

14:11.600 --> 14:14.978
Nobody's gonna play
your stupid vagina game, all right?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.437
Give it up.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.988
Hey, Dan,
corporate didn't mention you were...

14:25.072 --> 14:28.741
Come on in, man.
l was just going over some figures here.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.618
Perfect. That's what l came
to talk to you about.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.621
Seems we haven't gotten your numbers
in a few weeks. Everything on track?

14:33.664 --> 14:37.125
My numbers? They're good.
They're excellent.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.252
That is a relief,
because you know corporate.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.129
-They're all about the numbers.
-Yeah, man.

14:41.171 --> 14:45.091
Especially with that district managerjob
up for grabs.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.303
Well, it's a good thing
my numbers are so good, then.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.805
-Yeah, let's just have a look.
-No, they're not finalized yet.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.307
l don't want to steal my own thunder, man.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.601
Let's just have a little peek
at the thunder, huh?

14:54.643 --> 14:56.311
lt's no...

15:01.775 --> 15:03.860
l'm gonna make my numbers
this weekend, Dan.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.696
Come on, man. l've only...
l've got nine Gs to go.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.658
Yeah. That's great.
Doesn't the quarter end tonight?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.871
-Yeah.
-Come on, Dan.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.164
We used to make our numbers all the time

15:16.248 --> 15:18.124
before you guys opened
that titty bar next door.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.211
Titty bar makes numbers, babe.
They do what it takes to win.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.963
Now, if you don't want to play it tough,

15:24.006 --> 15:26.299
we'll just give that district
to the manager next door.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.342
He's a hotshot.

15:35.476 --> 15:41.189
This is not my office. How'd you get in here?
That tickle? Are you gonna press charges?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.484
Wait! Come back!

15:58.123 --> 16:00.541
Allison! What's up?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.587
What a gorgeous day to start.
You look amazing.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.965
Come. Walk with me.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.174
How long has it been
since we worked together?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.717
-Like, two years?
-Oh, my God.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.720
-A lot's changed in those years. Hey, ladies.
-Hi, Calvin.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.394
Hey, don't be jealous.
Seriously, it's so unattractive.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.562
You're gonna love working here.
The tips are great.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.022
-Hey, Cal.
-Hey, beautiful.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.233
And your boss is a pushover.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.322
Yeah, we're like one big, happy family.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.408
You know, l'm the father,
and you're my daughters.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.703
Well, you know, stepdaughters.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.955
-Wow. Things really have changed.
-Yeah.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.039
-Cal.
Yo.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.916
Can l get you to approve
this schedule change for me?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.751
-Autograph?
-You're the best.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.421
You got it, sweetie. Hey, gorgeous!

16:46.714 --> 16:49.257
l mean, Josh, you just gotta come to a show.
You won't believe it.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.552
l'm starting to dance, which is tricky,
'cause of the height thing,

16:52.594 --> 16:54.846
but because of the balance,
l'm not tipping anymore.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.056
l'm just... Standing tall.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.934
Hey, old man,
did you fuck that lady last night?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.644
You know,
the one with the freckles on her chest?

17:02.021 --> 17:06.523
l bet you did, huh? Did you fishhook her?
Did you give her the four-finger spread?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.192
Did you spit out...
Let me smell your moustache.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.194
Did you get it in there?

17:11.446 --> 17:13.114
Did you spit on it?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.952
-What happened?
-Don't worry about it.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.413
You know what? l'm actually thinking
about getting out of this racket.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.374
You know,
start concentrating on the band full-time.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.461
The band. Well, you'd better
get cracking there, Old Man River.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.463
l'm actually getting a lot of paying gigs.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.883
The MySpace getting tons of hits.
Got, like, 500 friends.

17:31.967 --> 17:35.303
This guy dropped a virus on there
so when you click, you hear my music.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.804
-A virus?
-Hello.

17:36.889 --> 17:41.059
What about all the poon you've nailed here?
l mean, who's gonna fuck all the cougars?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.144
Well, life's not just about nailing poon, bro.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.565
Dr. Faggot, your cock seems to be parked
in another man's asshole.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.944
-Why are you such a dick?
-Don't ask.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.115
So, what have you and your little botfriends
been up to lately?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.784
Dad, l told you.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.995
We're not gay,
we're just a couple of open-minded guys.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.123
-My son, the rope-sucker.
-Yeah.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.877
You know, l blame the failure
of our marriage on you.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.338
-Sweet.
-When l knocked your mom up,

18:10.380 --> 18:12.965
l told her l'd do the honorable thing
and pay for the abortion,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.344
and she was like,
''l think l want to have this baby.''

18:16.386 --> 18:19.680
And l was like,
''Bitch, you are having it. Tonight.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.350
''lt's coat hanger o'clock.''

18:22.643 --> 18:24.727
-Good one.
-Good one.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.735
Ta-Ta's isn't going away, Dennis.
You gotta learn to fight scrappy.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.822
lt's hard to be scrappy
when half my girls are over there now.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.700
l got nothing on the floor but dudes.
lt's like a Viking ship.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.537
And l'm trying to have a kid, man.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.207
Hey.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.794
She's a babe.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.632
-lt's... That's... l... She came with the frame.
-Sad.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.010
No girl is gonna get interested in me
if l'm a store manager in a strip mall.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.512
l mean, your wife didn't get interested in you

18:59.555 --> 19:02.723
-until you were a district manager.
-l'm better-looking than you.

19:05.310 --> 19:09.063
You picked a terrible time to screw up.
Shull is in town.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.941
The regional manager? Shitty puppy.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.570
-Yeah.
-Come on. This is ridiculous.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.489
He's looking to make an example
out of someone.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.909
Your Shenaniganz got closed
for culinary genital contact.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.745
-Tone.
-You just gotta help me get this promotion.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.583
Jesus, Dennis. Try to have some dignity.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.170
Don't talk to me about dignity!

19:32.254 --> 19:35.506
You ever have a whole fraternity
shit on your chest?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.592
And then not let you in?

19:38.468 --> 19:40.261
Not a fraternity, no.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.346
The bottom line,

19:43.056 --> 19:47.268
if you don't hit your numbers,
if you don't have a $9,000 day,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.437
you will not get that district managerjob.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.774
All right,
l'm gonna be totally honest with you.

19:53.817 --> 19:58.279
lf we don't hit our numbers,
if we don't make a $9,000 day,

19:58.322 --> 20:01.908
then the restaurant is shutting down.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.577
-What?
-Down?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.579
lf we're gonna be short
a few thousand dollars,

20:06.622 --> 20:08.789
they're gonna shut us down?
That doesn't make any sense!

20:08.832 --> 20:11.042
lt's a senseless crime.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.628
That's corporate for you.
They'll shut you down like that.

20:13.670 --> 20:17.215
-We've never come close to nine grand.
-Hey, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be,

20:17.299 --> 20:18.507
-right?
-Hey, hey. Hold on.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.092
Let me tell you a little story.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.429
1 983, it's the playoffs.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.724
We're facing the toughest team
in the whole high school region.

20:26.975 --> 20:30.144
-They only had, like, two white guys.
-Who gives a shit, Dennis?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.104
lf he put me in,
l would've fought like the very...

20:32.147 --> 20:33.814
Dennis, he doesn't put
the male cheerleader in.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.816
lf he had put the male cheerleader in,

20:36.318 --> 20:39.946
then l would've tried like the dickens
to get that ball into the end zone,

20:39.988 --> 20:44.033
and so must all of you,
all of us tonight, do so also.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.785
l'm putting a lot of promotions into effect.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.205
l'm gonna get the early evening menu going.
l understand.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.832
The elderly aren't the greatest tippers,
but l'm telling you,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.460
they're gonna give us
the most beautiful afternoon pop

20:54.503 --> 20:59.674
right before the dinner rush, okay?
And please remember the...

21:00.884 --> 21:02.009
-What's that?
-...effect.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.511
-Thumb fight?
-The butterfly effect.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.388
l told you about the butterfly effect.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.724
One little thing goes wrong,
the whole flow of the restaurant goes out.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.850
And l'll tell you one thing.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.311
Austin Kutchner wasn't kidding around
in that movie.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.021
Kootchman?

21:14.106 --> 21:16.399
-You know who l'm talking about.
-Who?

21:16.483 --> 21:20.861
Ashman Kitchnens. He wasn't bullshitting.
End of meeting.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.949
One more thing. lnappropriate language
in front of the guests.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.201
-That guy's a dick.
-Come on.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.661
Come on, come on. l do it, too.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.331
l say shit and ass and pud
as much as the next guy,

21:32.708 --> 21:36.377
but not at a 9-year-old's birthday party.
Clean it up.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.921
l am so fucked.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.508
Charlie, get my...

22:09.828 --> 22:13.581
Welcome to Ta-Ta's.
l've got a table waiting just for you.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.598
Yes.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.771
-How about top-shelf for a dollar more?
-All right.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.273
-l have a granddaughter.
-Thank you.

22:39.358 --> 22:43.402
-Wait!
-Fucking old people. That's all l need.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.822
l don't give a shit that ice cream
used to cost a nickel back in your day.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.116
l need to get paid, you raggedy-ass bitch.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.962
Hey, lactard, l think your nachos are done.

23:07.886 --> 23:08.886
You're an asshole!

23:09.346 --> 23:11.889
l'll have a Pepsi. She'll have a sweet tea.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.641
God.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.271
So, what can l get you folks to eat?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.733
-l'll have whatever he's having.
-Okay.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.151
l'll have the same.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.321
Medium-rare.

23:27.697 --> 23:32.493
There are a few dos and don'ts
here at Ta-Ta's. Come on.

23:33.578 --> 23:39.250
Whenever you send a check, okay,
you gotta go, ''Ta-Ta, girl.''

23:39.668 --> 23:41.085
-And the kitchen goes...
-Oh, yeah.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.378
See?

23:42.462 --> 23:45.047
Whenever you have a spare minute,
management wants you, like,

23:45.173 --> 23:49.135
dancing or hula hooping

23:50.262 --> 23:53.347
or, like, simulating any kind of a sex act.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.101
Now...

23:58.186 --> 24:03.023
What management doesn't tell you is this.
You are in a restaurant full of hot girls.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.484
Wars are waged, alliances are formed.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.571
You try to stay neutral,
you're gonna get killed.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.832
Yes.

24:24.087 --> 24:29.383
Man, l would love to ''F'' her in the ''A,''
and then ''C'' all over her ''Ts.''

24:31.845 --> 24:33.429
Well, l never.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.639
What? What, she work
for the ClA or something?

24:35.724 --> 24:40.769
How did she decipher that code? Fuck her.
Amber. Amber, Amber, come here.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.899
Listen, this is kind of weird,
but l've been thinking about...

24:46.276 --> 24:50.404
l've been thinking about experimenting
with homosexuality, and l...

24:52.908 --> 24:55.576
l don't think l'm gay, but you know,

24:55.660 --> 24:59.246
since you got that whole
Asian schoolboy look going on,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.582
l think having sex with you
would be a good way to test the waters.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.834
-What do you say?
-Screw you, Agnew.

25:03.919 --> 25:08.380
Come on. l'll make it hot for you.
Hello, love. Top of the morning to you.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.927
Biscuits and tea. Hello, hello.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.261
-Naomi.
-What? What?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.805
You told him? About my accent fetish?

25:16.890 --> 25:19.558
l was drunk. Why the fuck are you
telling me anything anyway?

25:19.601 --> 25:23.062
-So it's my fault?
-l have a drinking problem,

25:23.104 --> 25:26.023
and l don't intend to do anything about it.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.401
Come on, moppet. Show us your pink bits.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.906
-Those aren't real.
-Fuck off.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.866
Amber. Amber.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.788
So, is it just, you know,
European accents that heat up the kitty?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.332
l mean, what about a bartender
with a Southern drawl?

25:43.416 --> 25:45.125
What about an African dude going...

25:47.504 --> 25:49.421
l'm a speech major!

25:50.048 --> 25:54.343
What about, like,
a Middle Eastern guy? ...BMW.

26:00.517 --> 26:04.311
Shit, man. The restaurant can't close.
l just got a 75-cent raise.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.398
Finally starting to get more hours,
starting to learn the grill.

26:08.858 --> 26:09.858
Can't catch a break.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.820
Mason, why don't you get the fuck
out of here and go smoke a cigarette?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.823
-Actually, l was just about to...
-Don't argue with me, boy.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.243
-But see, you're telling me to do...
-Mason, go out that fucking back door

26:19.327 --> 26:20.744
right now and smoke a cigarette.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.204
-Wait, but l...
-Don't you ''but'' me, boy.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.998
Get the fuck out of here.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.213
l'm leaving now to go have a cigarette
because l want to...

26:36.177 --> 26:38.679
At least they're not picking on me.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.726
Why can't things go back
to the way they used to be, son, huh?

26:44.811 --> 26:48.522
'Cause that shit got old.
Shit, it got old being wannabe gangsters.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.191
lt got old when we were Goth.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.153
lt got old when we were ravers.

26:55.363 --> 26:56.363
lt got old through all of it.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.537
l mean, it was pathetic.
l mean, we were pathetic.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.086
Smoking cannabis, huh?

27:11.171 --> 27:14.256
Fuck you. Fuck T-dawg.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.431
-Thank you, sir.
-Right this way. That's right.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.642
There you go. That's it. That's the out door.

27:25.560 --> 27:30.814
-lt smells like a dog took a shit in here.
-Goodbye, sir. Thanks for coming.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.399
Die. Die now.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.943
-Watch your step.
-Die-die. Die.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.082
2,000 lousy dollars.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.418
2,000 lousy dollars?

27:54.089 --> 27:58.676
Those doddering, drooling motherfuckers.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.804
-Hey, Dennis.
-l am being ruined, Hank,

28:01.888 --> 28:06.892
ruined by those sluts at Ta-Ta's
and those pud-whackers at corporate.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.852
You sure use that word pud a lot.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.273
-What are you talking about?
-Pud. You say it a lot.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.778
lt's a word.
You know, l could take it or leave it.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.238
What's the matter with you?

29:33.688 --> 29:37.399
That's cute handwriting.
lt's all real nice. lt just...

29:37.484 --> 29:41.487
No, l'm sorry. l just... l don't think
you're a good fit for our establishment here.

29:42.363 --> 29:45.032
These tits were chiseled by God.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.034
l don't think you have
the right temperament.

29:47.827 --> 29:51.747
-You know what? Fuck you, Calvin.
-Okay.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.794
-You're still a fucking dork to me.
-Good to know. l'll keep that in mind.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.045
Bye.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.381
-Hey, Calvin.
Yo.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.343
There's this really creepy old guy
in the corner,

30:04.385 --> 30:06.553
and he's kind of skeeving me out.

30:08.014 --> 30:11.141
Okay. l got this.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.566
-Dennis?
-Hey. How are you?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.819
-How's it going?
-Good. Pretty great.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.362
-Okay.
-Great.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.743
l'm screwed.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.874
-Man, l love tits.
-No shit.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.335
l mean, hairstyles change, you know?

30:38.419 --> 30:42.047
-But tits, tits never go out of style.
-That's what l'm saying.

30:42.090 --> 30:46.426
-What do you guys think is the best size?
-A-cup. No question.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.178
Yeah.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.931
-What a gyp to get stuck with A-cups, huh?
-No shit.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.100
Maybe it's even better to be flat-chested,
you know,

30:53.184 --> 30:57.062
'cause then you're not objectified as much,
and you're taken more seriously, you know?

30:58.773 --> 31:02.317
You know, you're just saying that
'cause you have a crush on Amber.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.778
Christ, man,
you got bigger tits than she does.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.780
l'd say C-cups. Definitely the best.

31:06.823 --> 31:10.617
No, no, no.
You give me a pair of some big old dirty Ds.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.787
-Till you get them out of the bra.
-'Cause then all you got

31:13.830 --> 31:16.290
is cylindrical pudding
oozing down to her stomach.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.876
That's when you fuck them in the pool.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.421
Buoyancy takes effect,
makes them perfectly round.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.506
That's science.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.634
What do you think the girls at Ta-Ta's
talk about when it's slow?

31:28.386 --> 31:29.720
Menstruation and whatnot.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.847
Yarn.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.392
The violence in the Middle East
isn't going anywhere.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.394
l mean, l don't care
what kind of foreign policy we implement.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.187
lt has nothing to do with that.
l'm telling you,

31:39.272 --> 31:42.858
the men there are so sexually repressed
'cause the women wear those burqas.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.067
They never show their tits.

31:44.152 --> 31:48.405
-And Middle Eastern women have huge tits.
-Massive.

31:48.489 --> 31:51.241
Almost makes you want
to be Middle Eastern.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.036
-Almost.
-l understand things are tough, man.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.414
How about a half-off dessert promotion
with a Ta-Ta's receipt?

31:57.498 --> 31:58.874
Desserts have a huge markup, yeah?

31:58.958 --> 32:01.793
-Yeah, l guess so.
-Okay, perfect. We will start that next month.

32:01.836 --> 32:06.131
l can't start it next month.
l don't have time to start it next month!

32:07.884 --> 32:11.011
l'm sorry. My mother was right.

32:11.554 --> 32:15.599
l'm pushing 40, man. l'm not married.
l don't even have any prospects.

32:15.683 --> 32:19.061
Yeah, l understand, things are tough, man.
l'm going through a bit of a crisis myself.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.228
-Really?
-Yeah. l'm trying to decide

32:20.313 --> 32:22.105
which of those three chicks
l want to nail tonight.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.983
-l learned the ropes, you know what l mean?
-For fuck's sake.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.111
l'm sorry, man.
That's me being a dick, is what that is.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.948
-You're a dick.
-Yeah. Let me buy you a cup of water.

32:31.032 --> 32:35.118
You know, when l was on the fryer,
l said to myself, ''lf l could just be a server,

32:35.203 --> 32:37.621
''l'd make enough money
that l could start getting women.''

32:37.705 --> 32:41.541
So l left the fryer, and l became a server.
Making the money, nothing.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.001
-Right, right.
-l said the same thing

32:43.044 --> 32:46.546
when l was the assistant manager,
then store manager. Nothing.

32:46.631 --> 32:51.218
-Jeez!
-Man! lf l can just hit district manager,

32:51.594 --> 32:54.429
then l'll be pulling some hot trim,
and l don't mean whores, either.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.181
-Hey, Cal.
-Hey, hot pants.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.017
Hey, you know what?
Naomi said that you weren't a ladies' man.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.019
That you couldn't even piss
in a public bathroom.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.482
-Yeah, that was the old me.
-Come on. How did you change?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.026
First thing l did
was got over my pissing phobia.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.070
That was the root of my problems.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.657
I mean, so what ir some dude
checked out my schmack in the bathroom?

33:13.908 --> 33:16.994
l couldn't let that turn me into a pussy.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.830
lt's like, if l'm not man enough
to piss at a urinal with other men,

33:19.914 --> 33:22.165
then how could l be man enough
to take a girl's ass cherry?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.209
-l cannot agree more with that.
-Right.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.546
But then how did you get to the point
where you could talk to women?

33:27.588 --> 33:28.922
That's a good question.

33:29.215 --> 33:32.217
lt all started when l was still a waiter
back at Shenaniganz.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.303
l was talking to this high school girl,
and she rejected me, you know,

33:35.388 --> 33:36.805
like all of them did back in those days.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.018
You okay? Something wrong?

33:42.270 --> 33:44.396
So, yeah, l got home,
did a little lnternet surfing.

33:44.689 --> 33:49.234
You know, just general browsing.
Checked the stock portfolio, like you do.

33:49.944 --> 33:53.447
And I began thinking about my situation
and how shitty everything was,

33:54.782 --> 33:56.908
and it really bummed me out.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.372
I fought through the depression for a while,

34:04.083 --> 34:08.378
but ultimately it got the better of me,
and I was spent.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.304
So, as I sat in my chair, depressed,

34:20.433 --> 34:24.853
l remembered what Monty said to me.
He said women like assholes.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.274
So I found this website that teaches the art
of being a complete asshole to Women.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.985
-All the fundamentals.
-Women like assholes?

34:33.279 --> 34:34.737
And that was it.

34:34.822 --> 34:38.824
Yeah. l went and picked up a copy
of the DVD. Here it is.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.954
And then, when l started nailing hot chicks
by acting like an asshole,

34:42.996 --> 34:45.373
l started being an asshole,
which is totally cool.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.507
lt's Kristy again.
She keeps calling. She's like...

34:54.092 --> 34:57.511
l knew l shouldn't have invited her over
for that threesome with Sherry.

34:57.887 --> 35:03.517
l'm kidding. That's me being a dick again.
There was no threesome. l just fucked her.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.776
Hello, sir.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.654
Are you sick
of those cooze queens out there

35:15.696 --> 35:21.201
flaunting their shit in front of you,
only to leave you high and dry?

35:21.244 --> 35:22.369
-Yeah.
-You know us men.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.081
We make more money,
We reach higher management positions,

35:26.165 --> 35:28.250
and what do women have?

35:28.334 --> 35:31.962
Menstruation? Take it, it's yours!

35:32.046 --> 35:34.589
Pregnancy? Oh, dear me.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.592
You mean I don't get to lactate? Perfect.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.887
I'm Ken Halsband,
and in the next 45 minutes,

35:40.972 --> 35:42.848
I'm gonna change your life.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.893
Maybe you don't need sleep.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.730
lf you're not sleeping,
think about tired stuff before you go to bed.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.317
Josh, quick,
how much change in my pocket?

35:54.402 --> 35:57.529
-Agnew, come on. We're chilling here.
-l don't know, $2?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.991
So close. Buck-60. You're slipping, man.

36:01.075 --> 36:04.870
-What would the Jew elders think?
-Hey, Agnew, you think being a racist

36:04.912 --> 36:07.080
is gonna make it easier or tougher
being a cop?

36:07.123 --> 36:10.458
l'm not a racist, dick.
l hate everyone, all right?

36:10.543 --> 36:14.963
Old people, gay people, fat people, virgins.
lt doesn't matter.

36:15.047 --> 36:17.340
Think l care that Joshua's a Jew? No.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.302
l mean, l'm not gonna borrow money
from him or anything.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.934
-Why'd you take your bling off?
-'Cause you're right.

36:28.811 --> 36:31.479
l'm not black. l'm not gangsta.

36:32.273 --> 36:35.942
l'm just a chubby kid trying to fit in,
but l don't.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.866
We're so fucked!

36:42.950 --> 36:46.620
All those slits and tits next door,
the fucking whores.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.704
They didn't hire you, huh?

36:47.788 --> 36:50.916
No fucking restaurant's gonna hire me.
l'm too intimidating.

36:50.958 --> 36:54.127
l called Kiwi's to see if they're hiring.
Only lunch shifts.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.546
l have a friend who works at Nacho's.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.798
l really don't want to work
at a Mexican restaurant.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.550
-Who does?
-Mexicans.

37:00.843 --> 37:05.305
-Hey, watch it, fuckers.
-Could've told me he's right there.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.806
Nacho's won't hire me, either.

37:06.849 --> 37:10.560
l wrote ''Nacho's sucks'' in dog shit
on their front wall.

37:10.978 --> 37:11.978
How'd they know it was you?

37:12.063 --> 37:15.857
All right, it was my shit, okay?
So just leave me alone.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.026
l gotta figure out a way
to keep this craphole from closing.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.904
-Hey, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
-You shit in your hand?

37:20.988 --> 37:24.074
l believe that the positive energies
that you put out in the universe...

37:24.158 --> 37:26.034
That's kind of hot.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.829
-Go on, Eugene, taIk to her.
-I can't.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.749
I masturbate to thoughts
of talking to Women.

37:32.833 --> 37:33.917
Crap, l do that.

37:34.418 --> 37:38.088
Later on, We'll get into good opening lines
that'll break a chick's spirit,

37:38.172 --> 37:43.343
but for now, let's concentrate on learning
how to separate the pussy from the chaff.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.846
ObviousIy, you just want to hit on chicks
that'll put out,

37:47.348 --> 37:49.391
so you have to establish a hierarchy.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.061
Take these two over here sipping the Water.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.189
You want a bunch of sober chicks
that are gonna be peeing all night?

37:56.357 --> 37:57.774
Unless it's on you, forget it.

37:58.192 --> 38:01.653
Now, this one over here
drinking the Long Island Iced Tea? Bingo.

38:01.946 --> 38:06.324
Now, I'm not saying it's okay to have sex
With Women When they're drunk because...

38:06.909 --> 38:09.536
All right, I'm saying it's okay
to have sex With them When they're drunk.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.870
I mean, how else are you gonna get laid?

38:11.831 --> 38:15.709
Now, our friend over here With the cigarette?
If she's Willing to risk lung cancer,

38:15.751 --> 38:18.128
she's Willing to risk
a sexually transmitted disease,

38:18.754 --> 38:20.714
and that's a good thing.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.509
Look at this one with the tat.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.012
Tat alWays means good to go,
right, Eugene?

38:27.054 --> 38:28.596
-Right.
-Wrong.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.181
That's a tattoo ofa cross.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.766
-That means Ioves God.
-Right.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.143
Wrong again.

38:33.227 --> 38:36.313
See the earrings, see the neckIace?
Multiple crosses.

38:36.397 --> 38:40.233
Let me break this down.
One cross Ioves the BibIe.

38:40.693 --> 38:44.362
Four crosses, hates stepdaddy, loves cock.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.115
l want bad Christians.

38:47.366 --> 38:50.702
Now, the key is to find a girl
with severaI of those traits.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.913
You show me a girl Who's drunk
smoking a cigarette

38:53.956 --> 38:56.583
with a tattoo on her back,
does tons of drugs,

38:56.625 --> 38:58.209
and I'll show you a girl

38:58.252 --> 39:01.463
who'II take two dicks in her ass
at the same time.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.841
-I couIdn't sit down for a week.
-And that's not a bad thing.

39:05.926 --> 39:09.387
And speaking of drugs,
I highly recommend you start buying them.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.975
-Hey, Dennis?
-Hey, Agnew. How you doing, man?

39:14.060 --> 39:16.686
l gotta run home real quick.
My roommate locked her keys in the car.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.938
-l have her spare.
-Chicks, man.

39:18.981 --> 39:21.691
They'd forget their own vaginas
if they weren't attached to their legs.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.777
To their torsos.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.029
Good one.

39:30.951 --> 39:31.951
Asshole.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.169
Who's smoking weed?

39:43.130 --> 39:47.050
Guys, what the hell?
Hey, hey. That's not cool, man.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.719
Can l get a hit of that?

39:50.513 --> 39:51.513
Hell, no, Mason.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.140
-You never share your motherfucking weed.
-l always share my weed.

39:54.725 --> 39:55.725
ls that true?

39:58.813 --> 40:02.232
-Si, he shares.
-Yeah. l'm not selfish.

40:11.325 --> 40:14.828
What did Amber have to say?
She was looking for you.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.746
She was?

40:17.331 --> 40:20.250
Now's the time to make your move,
lover boy.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.510
Son of a bitch!

40:37.768 --> 40:41.855
-Allison, what the fuck?
-lt's just one cigarette.

40:41.897 --> 40:43.231
All the girls come out here to smoke.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.859
lt's a good excuse to come outside
to, like, hang out.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.945
-l was barely inhaling.
-You've been working here for one day

40:49.029 --> 40:51.698
and you've already turned
into Lindsay fucking Lohan?

40:53.951 --> 40:55.201
You take that back.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.956
Agnew.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.499
So, that's your botfriend.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.378
Can l have that?

41:05.588 --> 41:09.174
If a girl's all messed up
on drugs and alcohol and half-asleep,

41:09.216 --> 41:11.468
I don't think I'd feel right
having sex With her.

41:11.886 --> 41:17.223
That is a moral dilemma, Eugene.
Wait a minute. I think I have an answer.

41:17.766 --> 41:21.394
Fuck her, and then the next morning,
fuck her again When she's sober.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.897
If she lets you fuck her again
when she's sober,

41:23.939 --> 41:25.023
then you're out of the Woods.

41:25.065 --> 41:28.818
If she doesn't let you fuck her again,
then you got a little bit of a problem.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.988
But wait a minute.
It's not that big a problem,

41:32.198 --> 41:36.326
because somebody just got laid,
and that's a good thing.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.079
Fuck corporate.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.708
Meet Dennis Moynahan,
district cooze manager.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.302
Hey, Naomi.

41:54.386 --> 41:57.597
You been crying like a little bitch
in your office?

41:57.681 --> 41:59.724
Looks like this place
is gonna fill up pretty soon.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.310
-How's it going up here?
-Boring as shit. l hate you.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.604
Maybe you gotta work on your attitude,

42:04.688 --> 42:07.065
because l've noticed lately
you've been sort of a Negative Nancy.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.275
Well, l'm gonna be
a real ''Cunty McShitterman''

42:09.360 --> 42:10.652
if you don't let me back on the floor!

42:13.322 --> 42:16.157
Hey, you're pretty good friends
with Kristy, right?

42:16.242 --> 42:19.035
-No.
-ls she a heavy drinker?

42:19.119 --> 42:21.246
We're all heavy drinkers. l just...

42:21.288 --> 42:24.916
l know she smokes.
Does she smoke marijuana cigarettes?

42:25.584 --> 42:28.294
-She have a tattoo?
-Are you a fucking insurance agent?

42:28.379 --> 42:30.129
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Hi.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.966
-Hi, cooze queens, cooze persons.
-Three? All righty.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.717
Ladies. Excuse me.

42:40.391 --> 42:44.602
Someone's parents didn't pick them up.
Hello, Amber Alert.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.230
Oh, my God. This guy is being such a jerk.

42:47.314 --> 42:50.191
l just asked him if he wanted
the Early Bird Special, and he's like,

42:50.276 --> 42:53.945
-''What, do l look like l can't afford...''
-You want me to shit in his food?

42:53.988 --> 42:56.072
Kristy, look at me. l will shit in his food.

42:56.448 --> 42:59.951
-No, l don't think... That's too much.
-How about l tug one out in his refill?

43:00.661 --> 43:02.704
No, l... That's... He doesn't deserve that.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.330
-Crop dust.
-Crop dust.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.708
Hey, Chuck. How's your asshole?

43:07.585 --> 43:12.839
Hey, Suze, come here for a sec.
Hey, Suze. How's it going?

43:13.173 --> 43:16.009
-Good.
-Good. l want to ask you a question.

43:16.343 --> 43:22.181
Who do you think is sexier, Trina or Sherry?
l mean, they're both pretty fucking sexy,

43:22.224 --> 43:26.185
you know, but if you had to choose one,
gun to your head, who do you pick?

43:26.270 --> 43:29.022
Well, l wouldn't pick
either of them, personally,

43:29.064 --> 43:30.356
but that's just me.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.692
Are you out of your mind?
Seriously, have you gone crazy?

43:32.735 --> 43:37.155
Look at those girls.
They're fucking smoking hot, those girls.

43:37.197 --> 43:39.907
They have virtually no body fat,
except where it counts...

43:40.200 --> 43:41.659
So? Neither do l!

43:43.037 --> 43:47.373
Wow. No, interesting. No, l just never
thought of you, you know, like that.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.542
You know, you're hot,
but, l mean, are you sexy?

43:49.793 --> 43:54.130
-Being a slut doesn't make you sexy, Cal.
-lt helps.

43:54.381 --> 43:57.050
Well, maybe, you know, but l'm still, like,

43:57.134 --> 44:01.304
1 50 to 250% sexier
than both of those bitches.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.848
-Can you prove it?
-Fine.

44:05.726 --> 44:09.395
-And that's how it's done.
-Yeah.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.480
Right?

44:10.731 --> 44:12.523
-She's totally hot.
-Yeah.

44:12.566 --> 44:13.691
You said she wasn't.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.902
-She liked that, yeah.
-She liked that.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.821
Okay, guys. We want to detonate quietly.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.532
We want it to creep up on him
and grip him like a noose.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.534
l got one brewing.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.082
Mason, you going to be okay with this?

44:29.124 --> 44:32.168
You're not going to shit on yourself again,
are you?

44:32.252 --> 44:34.295
l hope not.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.048
-You know, like, owning what l'm up to.
-Yeah, l know.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.259
Really in the spot.
Well, just get some chicks.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.930
-Just, like, decent-looking.
-Yeah.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.181
-Decent-looking.
-They were cute.

44:45.432 --> 44:49.143
So, l'm thinking,
if you want to come over sometime, fine.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.771
l'm running on empty.

44:55.275 --> 44:56.401
Oh, no.

44:56.443 --> 44:59.070
-Smell that?
-No, no. God please, no.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.240
Do l smell weed?

45:03.617 --> 45:05.159
Bro, that ain't weed.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.247
Tell those tools it's on me.

45:09.915 --> 45:13.334
Smells like broccoli or something.

45:17.297 --> 45:18.297
Here's your drink, sir.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.800
The bartender took
extra special care of it for you.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.802
ls there a problem
with your ventilation or something?

45:23.303 --> 45:25.805
You know, l don't know,
but l will certainly check on that for you.

45:28.016 --> 45:30.518
Look. You dropped your napkin.

45:32.271 --> 45:35.565
l am sexually aroused right now.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.900
Here. You dropped that.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.697
What the fuck?

45:43.073 --> 45:46.325
Ladies and gentlemen,
Trivia Night's gonna start in 1 5 minutes.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.120
Why does every conversation
dead-end with us talking about tits?

45:49.496 --> 45:53.332
Because tits are what
this entire empire is based on.

45:53.417 --> 45:54.500
l mean, it's inevitable.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.669
Girls with big tits talk shit
about the girls with little tits.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.963
The girls with little tits talk shit
about the girls with big tits.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.883
The girls with real tits talk shit
about the girls with fake tits.

46:03.343 --> 46:04.427
What about the girls with fake tits?

46:05.262 --> 46:08.806
What about them?
They just try to get along with everyone,

46:08.849 --> 46:12.435
and yeah, okay, so maybe they got fake tits,

46:12.519 --> 46:17.273
but it really helps them make extra tips,
so it's kind of like a business investment,

46:17.357 --> 46:21.277
and maybe there's
a tiny self-esteem issue there,

46:21.361 --> 46:22.820
but screw you forjudging...

46:23.822 --> 46:24.906
Them.

46:28.827 --> 46:29.827
Whoops.

46:30.496 --> 46:33.122
-Hey, Kristy. Let me ask you a question.
-Hey.

46:33.207 --> 46:37.418
Who do you think is sexier?
Amber or Naomi?

46:39.254 --> 46:41.547
Amber, l guess.

46:42.466 --> 46:46.886
-She's younger and not so burnt out.
-Do you think she's sexier than you are?

46:48.764 --> 46:50.890
-l don't know.
-'Cause l do.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.561
Okay.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.731
That was really mean, Dennis.

47:03.737 --> 47:04.862
-Hello?
-Hey, Dennis.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.239
Just checking to see how it's going.

47:06.281 --> 47:08.950
Real good. l'm very, very confident
that l'm gonna get those...

47:09.034 --> 47:12.787
Yeah, give me a chili dog and curly fries!
So, did you raIIy your guys?

47:12.871 --> 47:15.581
Yeah. You know, l gave them
one of my famous halftime speeches.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.125
You didn't teII them
the restaurant's closing, did you?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.672
-Yeah, l did.
-Jesus, Dennis!

47:22.756 --> 47:26.509
Well, for what it's worth, I told Shull
you're the right man to run the district.

47:26.593 --> 47:29.428
-I really talked you up.
-Yeah? Great.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.681
But he didn't seem to care.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.224
Said if you were one doIIar short,

47:33.267 --> 47:35.977
you'd better get used to
sucking CaIvin's farts.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.979
His words. Later.

47:38.689 --> 47:46.445
The ass is the neW vagina...
The ass is the neW vagina...

48:01.837 --> 48:05.131
As a result,
my mouth tasted just like buttermilk.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.925
Great. Black people.

48:07.968 --> 48:11.679
Can l get some hot sauce and Kool-Aid
and not tip?

48:11.763 --> 48:13.472
Agnew, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it's 'cause

48:13.557 --> 48:15.850
of the white power structure in this country
screwing over minorities,

48:15.934 --> 48:18.978
and they make less money, and, you know,
don't learn the etiquette of tipping?

48:19.062 --> 48:21.439
You ever think of that?

48:22.441 --> 48:24.442
All right, Malcolm X. You want my table?

48:24.484 --> 48:27.904
No, l don't want to mess up
the seating rotation.

48:28.614 --> 48:30.740
Shit, what do l want to eat?

48:32.576 --> 48:34.410
l didn't even know we had egg rolls.
That's really...

48:48.258 --> 48:50.843
-Why you so shy around her?
-Dude, shut up.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.303
-You want me to go say something for you?
-No, no.

48:52.346 --> 48:55.431
Hey, l'm serious, all right?
That shit's not funny.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.269
Mase, what's it gonna be, man?

49:00.354 --> 49:02.855
We gotta get it in quick before the rush
or you're not gonna eat.

49:02.898 --> 49:03.981
And you can't miss a meal.

49:04.650 --> 49:08.736
Well, it's between the hamburger
and the chicken sandwich.

49:08.820 --> 49:12.031
Had a hamburger yesterday.
l've been in the mood for chicken, so...

49:12.115 --> 49:14.951
-You're gonna order the chicken sandwich.
-Yeah.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.535
-Yeah, l think l'm gonna get the...
-No thinking.

49:16.578 --> 49:18.537
l'm not offering it up for debate.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.415
l'm telling you, you're gonna order
the goddamn chicken sandwich.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.626
-Yeah, but l was about to order the...
-Don't you ''but'' me, boy.

49:23.710 --> 49:29.006
You're gonna order the chicken sandwich
because l am telling you. l will it. The end.

49:29.049 --> 49:33.678
You know what, Chuck? Fuck you!
l'm gonna get the hamburger.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.104
-l want the chicken sandwich.
-You're goddamn right you do.

49:43.188 --> 49:44.981
You're gonna order
that chicken sandwich right now, Mason.

49:45.065 --> 49:47.233
Now. With fries.

49:48.902 --> 49:50.027
-Curly?
-Yes.

49:50.862 --> 49:51.862
Shenaniganz.

49:52.698 --> 49:56.075
-l'm sorry to hear that.
-Eight ribeyes, two NeW York steaks...

49:56.118 --> 49:57.994
-What?
-...three Greek saIads...

49:58.578 --> 50:00.663
Okay, let's go! Look at this!

50:00.747 --> 50:02.456
Let's move, let's move. Come on.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.340
Mary-Kate and Ashley,
what's going on around here?

50:11.425 --> 50:16.178
Naomi just put in a massive to-go order,
like, a couple thousand dollars worth.

50:22.769 --> 50:26.814
Thank you so much for your business.
You really saved my ass.

50:26.898 --> 50:29.942
My caterer got killed
on the way to the office.

50:31.903 --> 50:32.903
Yes!

50:33.989 --> 50:35.322
Okay, men.

50:35.407 --> 50:39.076
Thanks to a Hail Mary pass in the 7th inning,
we are back in the race.

50:40.537 --> 50:44.874
Two points. Okay, we can still make
that sales goal and save this restaurant.

50:44.958 --> 50:45.958
You know what that means.

50:46.001 --> 50:50.004
This can either be your biggest failure
or your greatest triumph.

50:51.298 --> 50:52.757
And l don't want to frighten anybody,

50:52.799 --> 50:55.301
but if we don't have
an absolutely perfect dinner shift,

50:55.343 --> 50:58.179
then you're all out on your asses,
maybe even deported.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.475
So let's pull it together and win, win,
win one for the home team,

51:02.517 --> 51:06.062
and remember what is going to happen
to each and every one of you

51:06.146 --> 51:09.899
-if this place closes down.
-We'll be able to go on unemployment!

51:15.280 --> 51:16.781
Here you go.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.700
Okay, all right, okay.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.707
One margarita, our special...

51:28.460 --> 51:29.960
Remember the butterfly effect.

51:30.003 --> 51:31.796
Go, go, go!

51:32.881 --> 51:36.842
Okay, you've got a Wang Chung, a dime bag
and a beef vagina walking back.

51:37.928 --> 51:41.555
l got a booger chicken, a burnt tube steak
and a Whitney Houston.

51:42.474 --> 51:46.143
l need a Lincoln brown eye,
two kids' dicks and a stripper on the rag.

52:02.869 --> 52:03.869
Hi.

52:13.213 --> 52:14.213
Oh, dear.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.674
You guys picked my table!

52:26.893 --> 52:29.019
Folks, my name is Joshua.
Can l get you anything?

52:29.062 --> 52:32.064
-Do you have a salad bar?
-What's your fish of the day?

52:32.107 --> 52:33.232
No, we don't have a salad bar,

52:33.275 --> 52:36.068
and we don't have a fish of the day either,
all right?

52:37.070 --> 52:38.571
l... l am so sorry.

52:39.614 --> 52:43.325
Can we start over?
My name is Joshua, and l need help.

52:43.410 --> 52:44.535
Can l get you any?

52:45.203 --> 52:46.203
Hey, guys.

52:46.246 --> 52:50.457
l'm really sorry, but l messed up table 37.
They want honey-glaze on the side.

52:50.792 --> 52:52.209
-Don't you worry.
-lt's okay.

52:52.252 --> 52:53.752
Kristy, l love you.

52:53.879 --> 52:55.087
Do you think you could change it for me?

52:55.422 --> 52:57.047
-Don't ever apologize to me.
-lt's okay.

52:57.090 --> 52:59.592
Okay. Okay, l'll... l'll be right back for it.

52:59.676 --> 53:02.386
-Okay, thank you, guys.
-Bye-bye.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.183
Hey, guys,

53:07.559 --> 53:09.894
table 68 changed their order.
They need that steak well-done.

53:14.399 --> 53:16.609
Just this party of two here.
Right this way, ma'am.

53:16.651 --> 53:17.902
l'm sorry. You're a sir.

53:17.944 --> 53:21.822
Will you tell Naomi to get her ass up here?
Follow me, please.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.450
Well, hello there, folks.
lt's great to see you this evening.

53:24.534 --> 53:27.620
-Hey, you, too. How long for two of us?
-Just a few moments.

53:28.580 --> 53:32.249
We had a little hepatitis scare in the kitchen,
but we'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.292
l can get your name, though.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.337
Two?

53:37.172 --> 53:38.214
We're gonna hit a movie, actually.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.966
We don't want to miss
any of the advertisements.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.135
ls there something wrong?

53:43.595 --> 53:46.388
Where you going?
Come back, come back, come back!

53:46.473 --> 53:48.057
lt's only hep A.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.605
Do you work out?

53:55.273 --> 53:57.483
Why doesn't she just wear knee pads
and get it over with?

53:57.734 --> 54:00.903
Totally. l think l can read her lips
in those shorts.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.655
lf she comes on to one more
of my regulars...

54:03.448 --> 54:04.740
-Hi.
-Hi.

54:04.824 --> 54:06.992
-Hey, how's your first day going?
-Good.

54:07.035 --> 54:09.119
Good. Well, if you need any help at all,

54:09.162 --> 54:11.163
-you just let me know.
-Thank you.

54:11.206 --> 54:14.708
You know, maybe sometime
you could help me out with my outfit.

54:14.793 --> 54:19.004
-l mean, your top is so symmetrical.
-Thanks.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.343
-Hey, Raddimus.
-Yo.

54:24.386 --> 54:29.682
So, l was thinking about your little game
and that position you were telling me about,

54:29.766 --> 54:33.978
and l was thinking
that if you bent your knees a little more

54:34.020 --> 54:38.565
wouldn't there be a better view
from the backside?

54:38.650 --> 54:41.193
l don't know, it's just a thought.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.195
What a nice girl.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.559
l'm sorry, sir.
We don't allow pets in the restaurant.

55:13.601 --> 55:17.313
-Oh, no, he's a guide dog. lt's okay.
-Are you deaf? We don't allow dogs.

55:17.856 --> 55:20.566
l don't think you understand.
l can't see. He's my guide dog.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.692
He's allowed in.

55:23.611 --> 55:27.323
Why would you go to a tit joint
if you're blind?

55:28.366 --> 55:29.742
Answer that one, Stevie Wonder!

55:29.826 --> 55:33.120
You know something? lf you had a cane,
l'd beat you over the fucking head with it!

55:33.204 --> 55:34.621
-Hey. Naomi.
-l would! What?

55:34.706 --> 55:37.541
-What the hell are you doing?
-What? What? l'm helping.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.543
Why don't you go help over at Shenaniganz,
where you work?

55:39.586 --> 55:41.420
You're kidding me.
She doesn't even work here?

55:41.463 --> 55:42.463
-Stay out of this.
-Sorry about this.

55:42.547 --> 55:44.089
l'll have someone
take care of you immediately.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.508
You. Sweet tits. Now get the hell out of here.

55:53.266 --> 55:54.266
Fuck!

55:54.642 --> 55:56.894
Goddamn cocksucker,
going over there blind.

55:59.022 --> 56:03.359
What are you looking at?
Fucking blind people.

56:03.443 --> 56:04.693
Hey, hey.

56:07.989 --> 56:10.032
You are incredible.

56:25.590 --> 56:27.758
Fucking foreigners.

56:32.972 --> 56:38.310
Okay. Six Courvoisiers coming right up.
Okay, l'll get that right up for you.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.522
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, yeah.

56:43.149 --> 56:47.277
-What the fuck is this?
-l'm just going by rotation. Fuck off.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.364
Well, start rotating the Canadians
somewhere else.

56:50.448 --> 56:54.493
-l want to get off the Soul Train.
-Hi. Do you have room for a party of four?

56:54.577 --> 56:55.953
-No.
-Yes, we do.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.496
-Yes. We do.
-No.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.456
-Great. Okay.
-Come on.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.338
Hey, hey, hey!

57:06.881 --> 57:10.551
Adrian... Aiden, it's your birthday.

57:12.387 --> 57:15.889
Take it aWay, ladies. Ta-Ta's style.

57:33.533 --> 57:36.994
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

57:43.042 --> 57:47.796
Hi, sir. l'll be taking care of your service.
Can l get you something to drink?

57:49.048 --> 57:50.507
Yeah, playa. Y'all got any Kool-Aid?

57:54.471 --> 57:56.972
No, we do not have any Kool-Aid.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.517
Well, then,
l guess l'll have a glass of Bordeaux.

58:09.277 --> 58:12.112
Naomi, how many people
on the waiting list?

58:13.823 --> 58:15.782
Oh, my God.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.035
We might just pull this shit
out of our asses after all.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.425
You sure know how to pour.

58:51.444 --> 58:53.570
To our future.

58:54.447 --> 58:56.823
You know what l like
most about you, Dennis?

58:56.908 --> 58:59.201
-What's that?
-Your money.

59:04.123 --> 59:05.249
Oh, yeah.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.811
Thanks.

59:37.448 --> 59:41.201
All right.
We've got the house salad for you, sir.

59:41.286 --> 59:44.162
-And the broccoli cheese soup.
-Thank you.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.998
Enjoy.

59:46.666 --> 59:52.462
Wait. There's a fly in my soup.
That's disgusting.

59:53.214 --> 59:54.673
You know what?
Can you cancel my broccoli cheese soup?

59:54.757 --> 59:57.342
What other soups do you have?

59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.262
-French onion.
-Yeah, let's go with that.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:02.514
Wait, ma'am. l'm... l can replace...

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.017
Excuse me, can l switch mine
to French onion, too, please?

01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.184
Yeah.

01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:15.527
Okay, focus, focus!

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.240
French onion, French onion. Fuck me!

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:27.831
Son of a bitch!

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:32.377
l need fries and onion rings.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:33.879
lt's gonna be a few minutes.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.048
-You are fucking me, Mason!
-lt's gonna be a minute!

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.928
-Watch it.
-Out of the way, Miguel.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.930
-Mason, you look stressed.
-Shut up.

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:50.896
-Hey, Mason.
-Shut up. l'm busy.

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:53.398
At the buzzer. Three, two, one.

01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:56.860
God damn it, leave me the hell alone!

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.654
-Relax, man...
-l'm not gonna relax, okay?

01:00:58.738 --> 01:00:59.905
You've been picking on me all night.
Now quit it.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.325
-Yeah, suffering succotash, that shit sucks.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.202
l thought we were in this together,
you know?

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:08.205
Cooks against the waiters?
You keep attacking me!

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:10.248
lt's never been ''us'' against ''them.''

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.627
lt's always been me against everyone.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.131
No one's ever done me any favors.

01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:22.719
My dad was... ls... ls a drunk.

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.478
Look, l... l know what it's like.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.065
My dad's an asshole, too.

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:38.902
l've got four brothers,
and he named them all Mason

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.153
so he could screw over the lRS.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.408
And it didn't even work.
Now we're all still named Mason.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.910
lt's... lt's fucked up.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:49.621
You think that's bad?
Let me show you something.

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:54.042
This is what happens in my house
when you spill paint in the garage.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:01:59.423
Sour cream Sanchez!

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.802
Son of a bitch, l'm out of here!

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:07.139
-Hey, hey! Mason!
-No, l hope this place does close down.

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.391
Screw you all! l quit!

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:13.311
l forgot to punch out.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:17.482
We want our money back!

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.860
-Fuck this place.
-Yeah!

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:21.194
l'm not putting up with that shit!

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.823
Naomi, why haven't you
set table 43 and 44 yet?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.533
l have a 1 0-top
that's going to your station, okay,

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.326
so go run some food
and l'll get your table set up.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.037
-Sweet. Thanks.
-Son of a bitch.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.749
-l need our order, please.
-l don't know where the manager is.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.710
Nice carry.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.675
God damn!
Get that shit up and move it outside.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.678
What's wrong, Jew?
Dropped a quarter or something?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:47.846
l fucking hate him.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:49.806
-Hello? Hello?
-Hello?

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:52.184
Hello? This is ridiculous.

01:02:52.226 --> 01:02:54.644
We've been waiting for 45 minutes,
and we still don't have our food.

01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:59.691
Okay, l had the manager
comp your appetizer.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:02.861
l had to wait an hour for veal parmesan
that tastes like her ass.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.030
-Looks like you two are getting along.
-Fuck you.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:07.449
Hey, hey, big guy. Here's your napkin.

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:12.162
Looks like you chicks know how to party,
and l like that. Hank, let's go. Two free ones.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:15.123
-Two of what?
-Drink thingies.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.876
That's it. We're never eating here again.
This place is a death trap.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.504
-This wine is a fucking asshole.
-l agree.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.714
-Excuse me, can l have some more coffee?
-Okay.

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:30.931
-Bam!
-l would totally buy your CD.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.225
Naomi. Naomi.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.310
Naomi, what happened to my 1 0-top,

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:37.062
and why did you seat me
four tables at once?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.899
'Cause Chuck said he'd get me free drinks
if l quadruple sat you.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:45.654
-Why would he do that?
-Because welcome to your nightmare, bitch.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:50.659
Motherfucker.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.911
That waiter was...

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:59.000
There you go. Hope you enjoyed everything.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.169
l need you to do something for me,
Agnew, okay?

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:02.754
What's that, sir?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.550
l need you to start trying to be
a better person.

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:10.178
What are you talking about?
l'm a great person.

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:13.348
l mean, l... l joke around a lot, but...

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.935
Yeah. But after years of always joking,

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.605
you may find you're no longerjoking.

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.412
What the fuck?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:50.552
-Josh, you still pissed about that?
-Yes! l'm still pissed about it!

01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:53.388
Come on. You shouldn't be.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:05:00.061
You have the cutest little balls
l've ever seen.

01:05:02.106 --> 01:05:03.565
Fuck this! l quit!

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.737
l don't think he took that the right way.

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:13.950
Well, well, well.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.746
Nick and T-dawg, together again.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:21.291
Hey, you two used to be
some pretty good rappers, as l recall.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.001
We were fucking jokes.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:26.671
White kids that want to be black
is a little dated and cliché.

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.634
Let me tell you what isn't.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.678
White kids that want to be white.

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:39.768
Hey, fuck you, whitey!

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:56.159
Okay, you are all set.
Thank you so much. Have a great one.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.827
l used to work here.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:02.165
Really? Wow, crazy.
So what do you do now?

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.169
l'm a... You know, an exotic...
Like, a stripper.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:08.254
Right. You... Right.

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.175
So, how's the money?

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.971
l mean, look. l started off, like,
as a normal waitress, you know?

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:20.725
And l never even thought l'd work at Ta-Ta's,
'cause the outfits are so low-cut and...

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.435
But l swore to myself

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.604
that l would never take off my clothes
for money.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.481
You know, never.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:30.360
Until l met a girl who worked at Cheetah's,
and she made, like, 500 bucks a night...

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.070
-Whoa.
-...so l did that,

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.571
you know, for the money, totally.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:37.242
But l told myself, like,
l would only do a topless bar,

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:41.037
like, no bottomless. No way. No, no, no.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.875
And then l found out how much they make,
like, at the all-nude clubs, and so...

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:49.921
Doing that for a few months.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.386
But, like, no contact.
l mean, l work with girls who do that, and...

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:01.224
But l don't know, l mean, part of me wonders

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.601
when l'm gonna let go
of that boundary too, right?

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.689
l mean, right?

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:15.822
-For the money. Just for the money.
-Right. Anyway, thanks.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.581
l need to talk to you.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:27.292
-No.
-You were so awesome today, baby.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:30.295
-Haley, what's up?
-What is up? l quit!

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:31.504
Why?

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.257
l just found out l can make, like,
$500 a night working at Cheetah's.

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:36.968
Cheetah's!

01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:42.057
-God, we lost a good one.
-So, we still on for tonight?

01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:46.311
Let's do it another time, okay?

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:50.523
Listen, the important thing here
is not to blame yourself or Trina.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:54.736
-Trina?
-Yeah, she won the battle,

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.571
but, hey, listen, l have confidence,

01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:58.531
if you really bring the sexy,
you can win the fucking war.

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:01.117
-Screw her, all right?
-Done.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.412
l promise you that any sick shit that
that trashy bitch can do,

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.830
l can do, like, 1 0 times better.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.165
-Keep that energy.
-Bitch!

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.125
-Just bring it.
-You bitch!

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.668
Keep that passion.
That's what l'm talking about.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:13.171
-Hey, baby.
-Hi, Cal.

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:14.672
Love you. Okay, listen.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:18.218
l just need to close up here,
and l'm gonna hook up with my boy,

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:21.805
l'm gonna pick up some party favors,
and we're going to party all night long.

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:23.264
Oh, my God, awesome.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.308
Hey, l'm even getting some muscle relaxers,

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:28.269
-in case you want to bring your ''A'' game.
-Yeah!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.188
All right, l'll see you later, all right?

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.361
All right. Let's do this.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:47.872
Don't get me wrong. l mean, the band rocks.
l go onstage, people stop eating.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:51.209
lt's just that l feel, if l don't make my move
in the next few years,

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:55.380
l'm gonna become that creepy old guy,
you know, that guy.

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:59.759
Well, good news is being an old-ass
bartender is pretty depressing, too.

01:09:00.594 --> 01:09:02.595
Especially in a place like this.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.224
l mean, holy shit, this is a bigger dump
than the one l worked in.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.350
You know, it's funny.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:13.398
l was at a bit of a moral crossroads myself
a few years ago. l didn't want to be a server,

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.733
and l didn't want to get stuck
in upper management, so l quit.

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:19.154
See, that's what l'm talking about.
You followed your dream.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:20.947
Yeah.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:27.745
Yes, l did. l was unemployed for a long time,
and l got so desperate,

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:31.249
l took a job at Jack's Steak House
as an assistant manager,

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.501
which was then bought out by the company
that owns Shenaniganz.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:35.502
l fucked it all up.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:41.509
-You know lnternet porn?
-l think l must have drifted 'cause l lost...

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:45.513
l tried to... l jumped out of a window,

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:50.935
but it was a second-story window
and l broke my ankle,

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:57.192
and l got sort of, like, a little head injury,
then l became addicted to...

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.319
Have you ever heard of OxyContin?

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.540
Yeah. l got to piss.

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:44.239
Yeah.

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:54.415
So, if you're on MySpace,
get the fuck off of it.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.293
Be honest with yourself.
l don't know, l don't know.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.212
Because of the drinking, l tend...
l get very verbose,

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:01.714
and some of the other pills l'm on,
it makes me kind of ramble.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:05.426
Here's my point. You got a great moustache.
This is what l was gonna tell you.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.180
Whichever path you choose,
it's just gonna go like this,

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:13.309
and then it's eventually just gonna go...
Straight back to the middle.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:15.436
That's where you're gonna spend
the rest of your life.

01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:20.024
But it won't be so fast, like you know it,
it's gonna take a while, man,

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.360
and you're gonna pick up some hobbies
along the way.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.528
You're gonna probably do a lot...

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.571
You're gonna become
a chronic masturbator.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:26.656
And then eventually, you're gonna be like,

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.701
''Holy shit, should l put on a blue shirt,
or should l kill myself?''

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:31.119
l always put on the shirt.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:35.498
So, fucking irony of ironies,
here l am with a head injury,

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.084
a top dog in the Shenaniganz world.

01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:42.922
And now what l'm gonna do
is trample on the soul of a middle-aged man,

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:48.428
which, sadly, is one of the only joys
that l have left in my life.

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:52.849
That and, as l said,
lnternet porn and OxyContin.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:59.022
Tell you what l'm not gonna do.
l'm not paying for that drink. Thanks, man.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.189
Okay.

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:06.070
You don't deserve
an ugly bastard stepchild.

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:11.576
Well, well, well.
You knew the score and you let me down,

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.746
and you know what that means?
lt means you tarnished the uniform.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.205
l know what it means, Dan.

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:18.750
lt means you don't have what it takes
to handle district.

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:21.586
-Get up.
-Sit down, dude.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:23.129
Sit down.

01:12:23.213 --> 01:12:25.465
-Hey, Dean.
-Mr. Shull, okay?

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:26.591
You don't get to call me Dean anymore.

01:12:27.968 --> 01:12:30.511
You got some mayonnaise or semen
on the collar of your shirt.

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:33.931
Listen, Dennis, l'm really sorry, it looks...

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:37.435
l'm sorry it didn't work out.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.562
lt looks like you're gonna be store manager
for a few more years,

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:42.607
and l do apologize about that,

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:48.696
but if Dan here is any inspiration,
you know, you can certainly learn a lot

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.198
from his incompetence.

01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:53.576
-That's right.
-Not a compliment, Dan.

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:56.746
Whenever you get down about yourself,
whenever you have moments of self-doubt,

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.332
just look over here and say,
''lt could be worse.''

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:01.250
-Thank you.
-l mean that, man.

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:03.127
-Well, thank you.
-l have a lot of pity on you.

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:09.175
Okay, well, that was a good trip.
l need... l actually need some money.

01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:10.551
Cash, right now, if you could.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.969
-$20 would do it.
-l got a...

01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:13.971
-l need about 20.
-Twenty?

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.474
Make it a 50. Just round up.
Make it an even 50.

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.476
-That'll make it easier for me.
-Sure.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.979
Perfect. Ask and ye shall receive.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.441
Ulysses S. Grant,
where the fuck did my life go wrong?

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:30.071
So, you think we made it?
Place seemed pretty busy, right?

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:31.572
We're screwed.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.574
You bitches better be
dusting off your résumés.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:37.245
-Shit, l need this job.
-Well, you know, Ta-Ta's is hiring.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:41.916
They're looking for busboys.
Asian schoolboy busboys.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:48.297
Well, guys, we had a great night tonight.
We set a franchise record tonight.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:51.884
-Yes!
-My God! l told you.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:56.806
All right. Unfortunately, it was not enough.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.350
We didn't make the mark.
We came in at 7,200.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:00.768
-What?
-What that mean, man?

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:06.190
God, l'm screwed. l'm so screwed.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.152
-Fuck, so the restaurant's closing?
-No.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:14.240
l mean, the restaurant is not closing down.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:19.245
The restaurant... The restaurant was never...

01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:21.622
Dennis, what the fuck are you talking about?

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:25.084
-You lied to us.
-Are you fucking with us?

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:30.798
The restaurant isn't closing down
because l paid the difference.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.842
-What?
-Really?

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.636
You paid $1 ,800 out of your own pocket?

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:37.889
You live with your mom.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:41.684
l couldn't let them shut this place down
when we were this close to the mark!

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.605
This close to making it all the way
to the top of the thermometer!

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:46.981
How could l let that go by?

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:52.403
l'm gonna wind up in the gutter again,
sucking meth for dick.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:56.449
This restaurant stays open,
and l am going to be its manager.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.036
Of this restaurant. Just this one.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:15.259
Hey. Dennis, we are going out,

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.763
and l thought maybe you'd want to join us.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.724
-Want to come?
-Really?

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.100
Yeah, really.

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:34.695
ls that a yes?

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:38.908
Well, l have a lot to do, so l'm...
l'll check my schedule.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.159
Okay.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.955
-Yes.
-He can maybe come.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:49.752
Well, so, l told you,
everything does happen for a reason, right?

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:51.295
Screw Ta-Ta's.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.923
-Yeah!
-Screw Ta-Ta's.

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:56.551
Calvin wouldn't know a pair of tits
if it raped him in the woods.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:16:00.054
l mean, seriously, you guys!
Take a look at these!

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:05.560
Yeah! Motherfucker,
how'd you like these apples?

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:19.115
Those are beautiful.

01:16:20.033 --> 01:16:23.661
Hey. Heck, why don't
you and l go get a drink?

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.373
-Oh, man.
-Get out.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:33.838
What'd you say? You said, ''Get out''?

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.718
What are you pointing at?
What does that mean?

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:40.386
You're pointing at...

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:44.181
Did you leave something...
What's going on?

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:47.935
-Guys don't play hard-to-get.
-Yeah, they do.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.312
-They don't?
-No.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.023
Hey.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:56.152
Hey, babe. l got, like, another half hour.
Get a drink at the bar if you want.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:59.488
Yeah, actually, l think you're gonna need
to find another ride home.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.075
What the hell are you talking about?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.411
l just realized,
you're not good enough for me.

01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:08.581
We both knew that.
That never stopped you before.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:14.670
-Hey, baby. You ready to go?
-l sure am.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.005
What the hell?

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:25.139
Don't worry about it. lt's probably just sex.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.246
-There you go.
-Thank you very much.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.083
Put it on his tab.

01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:55.920
Very nice, Dennis.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.756
You're good at that, you little brown guy.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.722
l love meeting people playing pool.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.809
You need to make a shot. l'm so sorry.
Kind of got me in the gut.

01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:12.436
-l think l've got a new recipe.
-There he is.

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:13.938
-Mushroom stuffed with ziti.
-Hey, man. How you doing?

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.773
-Hey.
-How you doing? You all right?

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:17.233
-Yeah. l'm cool.
-Good to see you.

01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:20.277
Yeah, okay. All right. Okay. All right!

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.118
Allow me.

01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:32.998
Hello. My name's Stan.
What can l get you to drink?

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:37.795
-A shot of tequila.
-Well, that's great, isn't it?

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:41.257
-Make it two.
-All right, then. Hold on.

01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:49.056
Seriously, guys. l'm... l'm sorry. You know?
l... l suck. l pussied out.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:51.767
l know you guys were only kidding
with the sour cream Sanchez thing,

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.644
and l took it personally,

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:58.357
so put a quarter in my ass,
'cause l played myself.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:02.987
Hi. There you go, miss. Hey. Amber, is it?

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:07.324
l think l've heard about... Hello?
Went to the...

01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:11.370
lt wasn't the fryer that was so overwhelming,
you know?

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:16.333
lt was those fucking French onion soups
that you stick in the goddamn toaster.

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:19.795
Aye. God. For God's sake, cunt bastard.
Do you know who l am?

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:24.467
And l've got delicate hands, man.
l think, you know, l've got the prince's...

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.346
Hello.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.849
How come you've never talked to me before?

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.228
l mean, really talk to me?

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:42.276
We've worked together five or six times,
and l never even knew you spoke like that.

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:45.529
No.

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:50.534
l love it. l love the way you talk.

01:19:53.079 --> 01:19:54.705
l just can't believe l never knew.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.834
Most people don't think
it's as cool as you do.

01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:05.424
Wait a second.
You're fucking with me, right?

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.219
Chuck put you up to this? Goddamn.

01:20:08.261 --> 01:20:10.054
You're not gonna smear sour cream
on my upper lip, are you?

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.056
l got a lactose prob...

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:23.609
l just got some kind bud.

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:25.402
Do you want to go back to my place
and smoke out?

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:29.114
Oh, my God. Yeah. Okay.

01:20:35.872 --> 01:20:37.414
God damn it.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:41.585
You can do this.
Separate the pussy from the chaff.

01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:02.857
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.072
Hey, you. You mind if l sit down?

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:11.949
Naomi.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:20.291
Hey, you ready to get back on the floor
as a server?

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.251
l guess you've done enough time
at the door, right?

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:25.254
l think you've had enough time
being a dick hole.

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:30.843
That's not very nice.
l was gonna say you look pretty tonight.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:51.405
Hey!

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.575
-Hey, that's my...
-Hey, hey.

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:55.826
That's my mouth.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:12.760
Hey.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.345
-Hey, Cal.
-Hey.

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:17.681
So, let's get out of here?
Let's go back to my house.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:20.434
l was thinking
we could do some drugs, right,

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:22.436
and then make... Make out with each other.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:28.192
There's something different about you.
You got a haircut.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:33.197
No. Same hair. Just l got my hat on.
That's what it is. lt's the hat.

01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:37.034
lt's pretty slick, huh? Why, is it not slick?

01:22:37.535 --> 01:22:39.578
-ls something wrong?
-Listen, l'm going to stay here

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.163
and listen to the band a little longer.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:44.833
Why don't you call me later?
Maybe l'll come by, okay?

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:51.131
What? Maybe you'll come by? But that...
l have drugs.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:17.992
-Does that say ''PUD''?
-Oh, my God. How'd that get there?

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:19.702
Fuck it.

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.997
Fuck you, loser.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:28.127
-Piss in my asshole!
-No!

01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.837
Shit in my mouth!

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.411
What the fuck?

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:05.998
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:07.124
l...

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:10.961
That's your dick.

01:24:12.505 --> 01:24:14.214
This is my vagina.

01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:21.847
l gotta go. What are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:27.478
l thought maybe that now that you're sober,
you know, we could do it again and...

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.232
Sorry.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.778
-All right, fuck it.
-Whoa.
