01:59.519 --> 02:01.418
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

02:01.587 --> 02:02.610
- How are you?
- Fine.

02:02.786 --> 02:05.378
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- If you don't mind.

02:05.888 --> 02:08.080
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.652
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

02:11.821 --> 02:14.810
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

02:14.988 --> 02:17.510
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

02:17.686 --> 02:19.880
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

02:20.154 --> 02:22.585
Just kidding. I'll take it.

02:51.787 --> 02:54.151
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

02:54.321 --> 02:56.843
- I'm Kim's father.
- Excuse me, I work for her father.

02:57.021 --> 03:00.112
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

03:00.288 --> 03:02.379
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.280
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

03:06.455 --> 03:08.318
We're letting the kids
have their space.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.454
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

03:11.622 --> 03:14.781
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

03:14.954 --> 03:17.977
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

03:18.154 --> 03:19.642
- Dad!
- Oh, my darling.

03:19.821 --> 03:21.447
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

03:21.822 --> 03:24.083
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

03:24.255 --> 03:26.812
...how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

03:26.988 --> 03:28.783
It's bad manners to open the one...

03:28.954 --> 03:30.817
...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

03:33.287 --> 03:35.446
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

03:35.621 --> 03:38.917
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.519
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

03:41.687 --> 03:43.347
My pleasure.

03:43.521 --> 03:46.578
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
- You got it.

03:46.755 --> 03:48.516
Here. One for the book.

03:48.688 --> 03:51.483
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

03:52.089 --> 03:54.078
That's my girl.

04:01.188 --> 04:04.086
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

04:04.255 --> 04:06.017
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

04:06.188 --> 04:07.449
Oh, my... Stuart!

04:08.022 --> 04:10.181
Stuart, I love you! I love you!
I love you!

04:10.388 --> 04:12.149
Happy birthday, sweetie.

04:23.089 --> 04:26.781
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

04:26.954 --> 04:28.580
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

04:29.189 --> 04:32.416
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
- I guess not.

04:32.588 --> 04:35.817
- Will you join us for lunch?
- No, thanks.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.956
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

04:39.522 --> 04:42.148
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

04:56.589 --> 04:58.020
Thanks.

05:34.756 --> 05:35.814
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.646
You forgot.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.613
Come on in.

05:40.789 --> 05:44.085
It's not like I didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

05:44.256 --> 05:47.745
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

05:47.923 --> 05:51.014
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

05:51.190 --> 05:54.622
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

05:54.789 --> 05:57.277
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

05:57.456 --> 05:59.945
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

06:00.122 --> 06:01.679
Yeah, how's that going?

06:01.890 --> 06:03.685
Okay. We had her birthday today.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.378
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

06:06.522 --> 06:08.317
Seventeen?

06:09.190 --> 06:12.020
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

06:12.890 --> 06:15.186
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

06:15.389 --> 06:16.946
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

06:17.123 --> 06:19.521
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

06:19.690 --> 06:23.315
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
- We can dig if you want us to dig.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.752
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

06:25.923 --> 06:27.151
Thank you, Bernie.

06:27.324 --> 06:30.188
- How's Kimmy?
- Good. She's good.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.481
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

06:32.690 --> 06:35.179
Well, let's say we're working on it.

06:35.690 --> 06:38.917
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

06:39.090 --> 06:41.454
...in order to be closer to her?

06:41.957 --> 06:43.683
What a life, huh?

06:44.257 --> 06:46.780
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

06:46.956 --> 06:49.514
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

06:49.690 --> 06:52.019
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.088
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

06:54.257 --> 06:56.451
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

06:56.623 --> 06:58.487
I promised never to miss her birthday.

06:58.657 --> 07:00.748
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

07:00.924 --> 07:03.014
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

07:03.190 --> 07:05.986
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

07:06.191 --> 07:08.088
Where did you say
your next posting was?

07:08.257 --> 07:10.986
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
I believe it was.

07:11.157 --> 07:12.816
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

07:12.991 --> 07:15.457
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

07:15.625 --> 07:20.023
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.752
Who likes theirs rare?

07:24.491 --> 07:25.615
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

07:25.790 --> 07:28.018
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

07:28.191 --> 07:30.282
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

07:30.457 --> 07:33.583
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.620
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.416
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

07:37.591 --> 07:40.579
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.246
- We're one short.
- A singer?

07:42.424 --> 07:45.447
I don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

07:45.624 --> 07:48.522
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

07:48.690 --> 07:49.951
Job's a piece of cake.

07:50.124 --> 07:53.284
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own people.

07:53.457 --> 07:55.583
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

07:55.758 --> 07:56.814
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

07:56.991 --> 07:58.184
Yeah.

07:58.391 --> 08:02.119
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

08:02.892 --> 08:05.757
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

08:05.926 --> 08:09.254
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- I always get in the back.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.148
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

08:39.325 --> 08:41.416
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.753
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

08:49.158 --> 08:51.988
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

08:52.158 --> 08:53.749
Okay.

08:54.626 --> 08:57.592
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

08:57.759 --> 08:59.588
Thank you for coming.

09:13.393 --> 09:15.620
Wow, it was beautiful.

09:16.192 --> 09:18.783
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.515
Mills. Bryan Mills.

09:20.692 --> 09:23.386
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

09:24.325 --> 09:27.450
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

09:27.626 --> 09:28.649
Excuse me, miss.

09:28.826 --> 09:33.281
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

09:34.492 --> 09:36.083
Yeah, I do.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.418
Tell her to pick another career.

09:41.292 --> 09:43.588
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

09:43.759 --> 09:46.624
...and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

09:46.793 --> 09:47.815
- Who is it?
- Hello?

09:47.993 --> 09:49.788
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

09:49.959 --> 09:52.982
- He'd like to know if we want some tea.
- Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

09:54.893 --> 09:56.519
The noise?

09:56.693 --> 09:58.784
I'm at a concert.

09:59.426 --> 10:01.984
You know this song? Yeah?

10:02.159 --> 10:05.319
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

10:05.492 --> 10:06.959
I'm... I'm not attending.

10:07.126 --> 10:09.752
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

10:09.927 --> 10:11.949
Well, of course I met her.

10:12.126 --> 10:13.785
Who do you think's guarding her?

10:13.959 --> 10:16.118
I'm glad you're impressed.

10:16.293 --> 10:18.520
Hey, I'm happy you called.

10:18.692 --> 10:21.954
I'm happy you called. What?

10:22.126 --> 10:24.456
Lunch? Tomorrow?

10:24.959 --> 10:28.255
Sure, sure. I know the place.

10:28.425 --> 10:30.654
Twelve-thirty it is.

10:31.259 --> 10:32.783
I'll see you then.

10:33.326 --> 10:35.155
- Here he is. And?
- What happened?

10:35.326 --> 10:37.156
- She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

10:37.327 --> 10:39.519
- Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

10:39.693 --> 10:41.454
See? There's progress. That's great.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.354
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

10:58.527 --> 10:59.617
- Move!
- Go, go!

11:02.026 --> 11:03.357
More security here now!

11:03.526 --> 11:05.151
That's it. Move.

11:11.793 --> 11:13.656
Casey!

11:15.593 --> 11:17.456
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

11:17.627 --> 11:19.684
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

11:23.827 --> 11:27.260
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

11:27.427 --> 11:29.689
Come on, come on, drink some more.

11:38.895 --> 11:40.689
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

11:46.594 --> 11:48.151
You're safe now.

11:50.594 --> 11:51.821
Bernie.

11:51.994 --> 11:53.960
Casey. Rambo.

11:54.928 --> 11:57.485
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

11:57.661 --> 12:00.252
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

12:00.427 --> 12:02.325
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

12:02.494 --> 12:05.585
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

12:06.328 --> 12:09.157
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

12:14.461 --> 12:17.256
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

12:19.995 --> 12:21.825
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

12:23.462 --> 12:25.121
Yep, since she was 5.

12:25.295 --> 12:27.091
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

12:27.262 --> 12:32.455
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

12:32.995 --> 12:34.120
It's what she wants.

12:38.161 --> 12:40.320
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.484
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

12:42.661 --> 12:45.252
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

12:45.427 --> 12:47.360
The second number is my manager.

12:47.528 --> 12:50.119
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

12:52.095 --> 12:56.425
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

13:12.762 --> 13:14.921
- There she is.
- Dad.

13:17.996 --> 13:19.894
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

13:20.429 --> 13:22.292
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:22.462 --> 13:23.861
Don't look so excited.

13:24.028 --> 13:27.483
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

13:27.996 --> 13:29.256
I asked Mom to come.

13:31.296 --> 13:35.023
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

13:35.196 --> 13:36.628
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

13:36.796 --> 13:39.488
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.519
So?

13:42.095 --> 13:43.527
So, Dad, guess what.

13:43.695 --> 13:45.320
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

13:46.162 --> 13:49.185
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.418
How cool is that?

13:50.595 --> 13:53.117
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

13:53.295 --> 13:56.591
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.625
I didn't know you were so into art.

13:58.795 --> 14:01.818
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

14:01.996 --> 14:06.759
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

14:09.162 --> 14:10.628
And because you're under 18...

14:10.795 --> 14:13.626
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

14:14.196 --> 14:17.629
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

14:17.796 --> 14:20.626
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

14:20.795 --> 14:23.262
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.657
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.121
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

14:34.296 --> 14:36.024
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

14:36.629 --> 14:39.357
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

14:39.529 --> 14:41.756
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.919
Amanda's 19.

14:49.495 --> 14:52.018
How about this?
How about if I go along?

14:52.196 --> 14:55.027
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

14:55.197 --> 14:58.493
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.254
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

15:03.530 --> 15:04.654
I'll think about it.

15:04.830 --> 15:07.024
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

15:07.997 --> 15:10.462
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

15:11.264 --> 15:13.752
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

15:20.396 --> 15:21.658
- I don't get you.
- What?

15:22.397 --> 15:25.158
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

15:25.329 --> 15:28.091
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

15:28.263 --> 15:31.094
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.128
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

15:34.297 --> 15:37.593
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

15:37.963 --> 15:41.759
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

15:42.097 --> 15:44.188
You're pathetic.

15:59.597 --> 16:02.392
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.654
Three conditions.

16:06.997 --> 16:09.657
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

16:09.831 --> 16:12.797
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

16:12.964 --> 16:16.522
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

16:16.697 --> 16:18.458
It's international. My number is in.

16:18.631 --> 16:20.756
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

16:20.931 --> 16:22.191
- I am.
- What did I say?

16:22.397 --> 16:25.693
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

16:25.898 --> 16:28.693
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

16:28.898 --> 16:32.023
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

16:32.198 --> 16:33.686
Okay.

16:34.631 --> 16:36.460
- There you go.
- Yes.

16:36.631 --> 16:39.962
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.825
Mom!

16:43.899 --> 16:44.922
I love you, Dad.

16:45.764 --> 16:49.128
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

16:52.932 --> 16:55.625
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

16:55.797 --> 16:59.423
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

17:03.497 --> 17:06.589
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

17:06.763 --> 17:07.992
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

17:08.165 --> 17:11.960
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.824
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

17:15.298 --> 17:17.025
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

17:17.198 --> 17:18.925
Well, my job made me aware.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.118
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

17:24.298 --> 17:26.627
And she would tell me to ask you.

17:26.797 --> 17:30.424
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.326
Yeah? Why?

17:33.199 --> 17:35.994
I don't know. Maybe because...

17:36.599 --> 17:38.827
...I was afraid to find out.

17:40.665 --> 17:42.824
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

17:43.432 --> 17:46.330
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

17:46.833 --> 17:51.094
So you were like a spy, right?

17:51.266 --> 17:54.699
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

17:55.431 --> 18:00.762
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

18:00.932 --> 18:02.762
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

18:03.398 --> 18:05.092
What did you prevent?

18:05.266 --> 18:07.255
Bad things from happening.

18:07.699 --> 18:11.824
So it was a good job?

18:11.999 --> 18:14.794
Yes. Yep, it was.

18:17.032 --> 18:18.759
Do you miss it?

18:19.331 --> 18:20.593
I missed you more.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.964
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

18:38.133 --> 18:39.962
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

19:01.833 --> 19:04.356
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

19:04.532 --> 19:05.964
Lenore.

19:06.132 --> 19:08.963
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

19:09.766 --> 19:11.288
- I know.
- She lied to me.

19:11.466 --> 19:13.626
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.856
Why? What are you talking about?

19:16.033 --> 19:17.693
Your rules and conditions.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.161
What is this?

19:19.333 --> 19:22.095
It's U2's European tour dates.

19:22.268 --> 19:24.256
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

19:24.433 --> 19:28.126
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.460
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

19:31.634 --> 19:34.998
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.655
No idea what the world is like.

19:36.833 --> 19:40.630
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

19:42.901 --> 19:44.764
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

19:44.933 --> 19:48.865
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.090
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.289
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.297
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.991
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

20:14.001 --> 20:15.024
Girls.

20:20.667 --> 20:21.827
Kim!

20:27.800 --> 20:28.823
I love you.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.996
Let's go. Come on.

20:45.101 --> 20:46.964
I'll teach you the French words
I know.

20:47.134 --> 20:49.691
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.691
Three. Okay, now take one...

20:56.902 --> 20:58.834
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

20:59.401 --> 21:01.333
Yes, please.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.525
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

21:03.701 --> 21:06.462
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

21:06.635 --> 21:07.658
Where are you from?

21:08.168 --> 21:09.895
California.

21:15.768 --> 21:16.825
No. I'm Peter.

21:22.668 --> 21:24.497
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

21:24.668 --> 21:25.827
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

21:26.002 --> 21:27.467
Hey.

21:27.635 --> 21:30.100
You're going into Paris?

21:30.768 --> 21:33.199
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

21:33.401 --> 21:34.527
Want to share?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.496
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

21:36.668 --> 21:38.497
Thanks.

21:40.034 --> 21:43.626
<i>To check arrivals,</i>
<i>please press one.</i>

21:43.801 --> 21:46.289
<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

21:48.469 --> 21:51.833
<i>Flight 288 arrived</i>
<i>in Paris Charles de Gaulle...</i>

21:52.003 --> 21:55.526
<i>... at 8 a.m. local time.</i>

21:56.769 --> 21:58.166
Yeah.

21:58.335 --> 22:00.823
Oh, are you serious?

22:01.002 --> 22:03.298
- Oh, my God.
- Nice address.

22:03.469 --> 22:04.833
Oh, yeah, thanks.

22:05.003 --> 22:09.128
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

22:09.302 --> 22:10.858
How cool is that?

22:11.035 --> 22:13.660
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

22:13.835 --> 22:15.859
Well, I have to be going.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.763
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

22:17.936 --> 22:18.992
- You too.
- Bye.

22:20.035 --> 22:21.160
Hey.

22:22.102 --> 22:24.761
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

22:24.935 --> 22:26.662
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

22:26.835 --> 22:29.028
What is there to know? He's hot.

22:29.202 --> 22:31.327
- I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

22:31.501 --> 22:33.525
Okay, great. Your apartment?

22:33.702 --> 22:37.293
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

22:37.469 --> 22:39.095
Bye.

22:47.502 --> 22:48.594
Yeah.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.592
Fifth floor.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.429
Two girls around 18.

22:55.669 --> 22:57.794
Oh, my God.

22:57.969 --> 23:01.094
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

23:01.270 --> 23:04.134
I just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

23:04.303 --> 23:06.962
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.432
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

23:09.603 --> 23:11.432
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.431
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

23:14.603 --> 23:16.091
- Peter.
- You just met him.

23:16.636 --> 23:19.625
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

23:19.802 --> 23:22.166
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

23:22.336 --> 23:23.528
- No.
- Oh, come on.

23:23.702 --> 23:27.499
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

23:32.004 --> 23:33.163
Hey!

23:52.937 --> 23:55.129
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

23:55.303 --> 23:56.395
I have to pee!

24:22.504 --> 24:24.595
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

24:24.971 --> 24:29.596
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

24:29.771 --> 24:32.033
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

24:32.204 --> 24:34.329
Have a drink or something. Good night.

24:35.272 --> 24:37.134
Good night.

24:53.204 --> 24:54.295
Hi, Daddy.

24:55.271 --> 24:57.032
Kim.

24:58.604 --> 25:01.127
What did I say?
You were supposed to call me.

25:01.303 --> 25:02.327
I'm sorry.

25:02.504 --> 25:04.765
<i>I thought something was wrong</i>
<i>with the phone.</i>

25:04.937 --> 25:07.631
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

25:07.803 --> 25:10.463
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

25:10.638 --> 25:12.297
<i>... I would've just called there.</i>

25:12.471 --> 25:13.528
<i>What's the number?</i>

25:13.704 --> 25:16.296
- <i>I don't have it.</i>
- Kimmy, come on.

25:16.472 --> 25:19.267
<i>This is one of the conditions.</i>
<i>Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

25:19.437 --> 25:21.097
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

25:21.272 --> 25:24.931
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

25:25.438 --> 25:27.164
To Spain?

25:28.405 --> 25:31.894
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

25:35.271 --> 25:37.170
Kimmy.

25:41.138 --> 25:44.127
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

25:44.305 --> 25:46.032
No.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.270
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

25:49.838 --> 25:51.997
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

25:52.171 --> 25:53.431
- Dad.
- <i>Kim.</i>

25:55.038 --> 25:57.334
- <i>Kim.</i>
- Dad. They took her.

25:57.505 --> 25:59.800
- <i>They took her.</i>
- All right, listen to me.

25:59.971 --> 26:01.436
Oh, God.

26:01.604 --> 26:04.195
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

26:04.404 --> 26:07.428
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

26:07.605 --> 26:09.264
- Peter? Peter who?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

26:09.438 --> 26:10.598
- An American?
- <i>No.</i>

26:10.772 --> 26:12.795
Did he know where you were staying?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.460
He took a cab with us.

26:17.039 --> 26:20.130
Dad, they're coming.

26:20.672 --> 26:23.332
- <i>Please, I'm scared.</i>
- I know you are.

26:23.506 --> 26:25.869
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.595
How many people are there?

26:27.772 --> 26:30.260
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

26:31.905 --> 26:34.337
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

26:34.505 --> 26:37.198
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

26:45.672 --> 26:49.036
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

26:52.338 --> 26:56.202
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

26:56.405 --> 26:59.839
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.528
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.</i>
<i>Concentrate.</i>

27:02.705 --> 27:06.763
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

27:06.940 --> 27:09.303
Anything you see. You understand?

27:13.039 --> 27:14.699
They're there. I can hear them.

27:14.907 --> 27:16.702
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

27:29.772 --> 27:31.601
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

27:56.774 --> 27:59.830
They're leaving. I think they're...

28:03.706 --> 28:08.638
<i>Beard. Six feet.</i>
<i>Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

28:29.140 --> 28:31.765
I don't know who you are.

28:33.139 --> 28:35.197
I don't know what you want.

28:35.407 --> 28:39.304
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

28:39.473 --> 28:43.873
But what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.871
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

28:47.041 --> 28:50.905
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

28:51.474 --> 28:54.804
If you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

28:54.974 --> 28:58.838
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

28:59.007 --> 29:02.804
But if you don't, I will look for you.

29:02.974 --> 29:05.701
I will find you...

29:05.908 --> 29:08.204
...and I will kill you.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.007
<i>Good luck.</i>

29:25.207 --> 29:27.366
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

29:27.540 --> 29:31.632
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

29:32.408 --> 29:33.999
- She's been taken.
- What?

29:34.174 --> 29:36.504
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

29:36.675 --> 29:39.607
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

29:39.775 --> 29:43.366
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

29:43.541 --> 29:46.336
- How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

29:46.508 --> 29:49.338
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

29:49.508 --> 29:52.668
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

29:52.842 --> 29:55.001
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

29:55.174 --> 29:57.140
- Which room's Kim's?
- What happened?

29:57.308 --> 30:00.797
I got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

30:00.974 --> 30:02.338
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

30:02.508 --> 30:04.133
That one.

30:08.341 --> 30:10.136
Is there something I should be doing?

30:10.308 --> 30:13.206
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

30:13.408 --> 30:14.930
I do.

30:15.441 --> 30:17.304
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

30:17.475 --> 30:18.600
An hour ago.

30:18.775 --> 30:22.172
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

30:30.909 --> 30:34.307
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

30:35.009 --> 30:36.202
First I have to find her.

30:40.508 --> 30:43.100
Sam, what have you got?

30:43.276 --> 30:44.503
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

30:44.676 --> 30:48.108
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

30:48.276 --> 30:50.104
<i>The place is ground zero</i>
<i>for scummers.</i>

30:50.275 --> 30:52.503
<i>Even the Russians</i>
<i>give these guys a wide berth.</i>

30:53.141 --> 30:55.471
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

30:55.642 --> 30:57.632
We have information
that a mobster boss...

30:57.808 --> 31:01.002
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

31:01.175 --> 31:06.937
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.</i>
<i>The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

31:07.109 --> 31:10.007
- <i>Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?</i>
- Lenore is here.

31:10.509 --> 31:13.440
- <i>Hey, Lennie.</i>
- Hello, Sam.

31:13.642 --> 31:15.006
She needs to hear it, Sam.

31:15.942 --> 31:19.966
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

31:23.609 --> 31:25.768
- Keep going.
- Okay.

31:25.943 --> 31:30.705
Their previous m.o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

31:30.910 --> 31:34.933
<i>... like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,</i>
<i>jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

31:35.109 --> 31:39.542
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

31:41.010 --> 31:43.942
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

31:44.110 --> 31:48.974
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

31:49.143 --> 31:51.540
Oh, my little baby.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.265
What else?

31:53.476 --> 31:56.533
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

31:56.709 --> 31:59.539
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

31:59.708 --> 32:02.175
- To what?
- To never finding her.

32:02.342 --> 32:05.433
No, no, no.

32:05.609 --> 32:07.269
<i>Daddy!</i>

32:07.976 --> 32:11.704
<i>Mustache. Six feet.</i>
<i>Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

32:11.911 --> 32:13.536
<i>Da...</i>

32:20.342 --> 32:22.332
<i>Good luck.</i>

32:25.210 --> 32:26.937
<i>Good luck.</i>

32:28.643 --> 32:30.132
<i>Good luck.</i>

32:31.776 --> 32:33.004
<i>Good luck.</i>

34:11.844 --> 34:13.606
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

34:15.844 --> 34:17.538
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

34:28.645 --> 34:29.667
<i>Oh, God.</i>

34:30.444 --> 34:33.706
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

34:36.511 --> 34:37.668
<i>They took her.</i>

34:37.844 --> 34:40.139
<i>Go to the next bedroom.</i>
<i>Get under the bed.</i>

34:40.311 --> 34:43.676
- <i>Tell me when you're there.</i>
- <i>I'm here.</i>

34:49.712 --> 34:52.610
<i>Stay focused, baby.</i>
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

34:52.777 --> 34:55.266
<i>Concentrate. Shout out</i>
<i>everything you see about them.</i>

34:55.444 --> 34:59.309
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.</i>
<i>Anything you see. You understand?</i>

34:59.479 --> 35:02.445
<i>They're there. I can hear them.</i>
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

35:15.679 --> 35:18.508
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

35:21.444 --> 35:22.705
<i>Dad!</i>

35:23.678 --> 35:27.111
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

35:27.312 --> 35:28.902
Dad!

37:10.613 --> 37:11.704
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:11.914 --> 37:13.504
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.975
- On holidays?
- Yes.

37:15.146 --> 37:16.840
- Me too.
- Cool.

37:17.014 --> 37:19.480
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

37:19.648 --> 37:21.978
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

37:24.114 --> 37:26.171
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.041
- Hey.
- Drive.

37:32.648 --> 37:35.307
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

37:36.014 --> 37:40.106
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

39:41.815 --> 39:44.780
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

39:44.948 --> 39:46.380
Between you and me? No.

39:46.548 --> 39:49.877
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

39:50.048 --> 39:52.344
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

39:52.916 --> 39:56.872
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

39:57.050 --> 40:00.446
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

40:00.615 --> 40:04.548
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

40:04.716 --> 40:07.011
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

40:07.549 --> 40:09.947
And I assume you don't want
to go to the police.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.878
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

40:13.049 --> 40:16.981
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.779
You found him that way?

40:24.416 --> 40:27.813
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris...

40:27.982 --> 40:30.141
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if I have to.

40:30.316 --> 40:32.975
- Don't forget who you talk to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

40:33.149 --> 40:38.207
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

40:38.416 --> 40:41.870
"Deputy director, Internal Security."
Very impressive.

40:42.049 --> 40:44.015
The Albanians?

40:44.283 --> 40:47.114
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

40:47.283 --> 40:49.647
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.

40:49.816 --> 40:52.509
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

40:52.683 --> 40:55.410
So I heard. Where do I find them?

40:55.616 --> 41:01.845
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

42:05.417 --> 42:07.713
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.213
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

42:15.017 --> 42:16.313
Here is my résumé.

42:16.484 --> 42:19.279
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

42:19.450 --> 42:22.381
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

42:22.549 --> 42:25.674
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary school...

42:25.850 --> 42:28.613
...before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

42:28.785 --> 42:30.045
My rate?

42:30.218 --> 42:33.378
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up...

42:33.551 --> 42:37.347
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

42:38.485 --> 42:41.973
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

42:42.151 --> 42:44.481
Right now the job is to wait here.

42:52.518 --> 42:53.949
Good evening.

42:54.118 --> 42:58.141
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

42:58.550 --> 43:00.540
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?

43:00.718 --> 43:02.616
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

43:02.784 --> 43:06.113
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

43:06.284 --> 43:08.342
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

43:08.518 --> 43:10.313
Standard? Could you be more specific?

43:10.485 --> 43:13.144
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

43:13.318 --> 43:15.681
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

43:15.851 --> 43:18.841
- If you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

43:19.018 --> 43:21.144
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

43:21.319 --> 43:23.182
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

43:23.352 --> 43:27.010
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

43:27.184 --> 43:30.639
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

43:30.818 --> 43:33.011
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

43:33.185 --> 43:35.844
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

43:36.019 --> 43:39.281
If I want a package deal,
do I get a discount?

43:39.818 --> 43:43.147
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

43:44.219 --> 43:47.049
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

43:48.051 --> 43:49.779
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

43:49.951 --> 43:52.781
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

43:52.951 --> 43:55.281
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

43:55.451 --> 43:58.042
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

43:58.218 --> 44:01.013
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

44:01.184 --> 44:03.116
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

44:03.285 --> 44:05.478
I don't owe you nothing.

44:07.019 --> 44:10.179
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

44:10.352 --> 44:12.114
Chill.

44:14.119 --> 44:18.018
Okay. Here's your 50.

44:18.785 --> 44:22.809
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

44:22.986 --> 44:25.679
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

44:31.652 --> 44:35.449
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

44:35.619 --> 44:38.551
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

44:38.719 --> 44:40.617
This.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.317
Translate.

44:50.052 --> 44:52.950
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

44:53.119 --> 44:55.778
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

44:55.952 --> 44:59.407
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
- what an asshole you are.

45:01.019 --> 45:03.646
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this...

45:03.819 --> 45:05.478
Just translate.

45:05.686 --> 45:08.482
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

45:08.653 --> 45:09.847
Keep going.

45:10.020 --> 45:14.476
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

45:14.654 --> 45:18.108
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

45:19.287 --> 45:23.309
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

45:23.486 --> 45:25.385
And they lost money on the betting.

45:25.552 --> 45:30.110
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

45:30.287 --> 45:32.549
Is it still football?

45:32.720 --> 45:34.685
One is on the phone.

45:34.853 --> 45:37.149
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.343
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.883
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.

45:43.053 --> 45:45.985
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

45:47.186 --> 45:51.016
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

45:53.453 --> 45:54.476
Thank you.

47:32.553 --> 47:33.645
I love you.

47:49.322 --> 47:51.413
Where did you get this?

47:51.622 --> 47:53.644
Where did you get this?

47:53.922 --> 47:56.820
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

47:58.122 --> 48:01.213
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

48:03.721 --> 48:05.278
Hey.

48:29.222 --> 48:30.848
Hey.

48:45.355 --> 48:46.980
Come on.

52:27.492 --> 52:29.185
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

52:29.357 --> 52:31.221
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

52:31.425 --> 52:32.947
Well, still in charge.

52:33.125 --> 52:35.852
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

52:36.458 --> 52:38.515
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

54:25.193 --> 54:26.215
Yes?

54:26.426 --> 54:28.948
- <i>We need to talk.</i>
- I'm listening.

54:31.193 --> 54:33.125
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

54:33.294 --> 54:34.920
I can't see you. Where are you?

54:35.194 --> 54:37.853
I can see you and hear you very well.

54:38.693 --> 54:41.057
You can tell them
to stop jogging now.

54:49.294 --> 54:51.486
Didn't think
I was gonna come down, did you?

54:51.660 --> 54:53.956
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

54:54.127 --> 54:56.151
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

54:56.326 --> 54:59.451
- <i>I know. You have 70 hours.</i>
- Now I have 56.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.819
No, now you have none.

55:02.993 --> 55:06.221
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

55:07.027 --> 55:11.857
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.</i>
<i>First class.</i>

55:12.027 --> 55:15.016
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

55:18.327 --> 55:21.782
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

55:21.961 --> 55:25.324
<i>I take my orders from someone</i>
<i>who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

55:25.494 --> 55:29.154
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

55:29.328 --> 55:30.657
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

55:30.827 --> 55:34.157
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

55:34.328 --> 55:36.953
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

55:40.627 --> 55:43.058
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

55:43.227 --> 55:45.659
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.

55:45.861 --> 55:47.521
It was a trailer, not a building.

56:27.855 --> 56:29.343
No, no, no. Leave it.

56:30.187 --> 56:31.948
It's all right, it's fluids.

56:32.154 --> 56:34.144
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

56:34.954 --> 56:36.216
It's all right.

56:39.322 --> 56:40.344
Where'd you get this?

56:41.154 --> 56:43.279
Where did you get this jacket?

56:44.521 --> 56:45.680
Did you get it from her?

56:46.321 --> 56:48.310
Was it from this girl?

56:50.621 --> 56:52.281
I didn't steal it.

56:52.453 --> 56:56.113
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

56:57.787 --> 57:00.310
- In the house.
- What house?

57:01.454 --> 57:03.113
The house with the red door.

57:06.122 --> 57:07.452
Sorry.

57:12.489 --> 57:15.716
He said it was a party.

57:16.788 --> 57:19.186
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

57:24.355 --> 57:25.981
She was nice.

57:26.155 --> 57:27.678
I know.

57:28.654 --> 57:30.143
She's my daughter.

57:35.288 --> 57:38.015
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

57:44.788 --> 57:45.845
Paradise.

58:01.956 --> 58:03.615
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

58:03.789 --> 58:05.914
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

58:11.456 --> 58:13.546
We're doing nothing wrong here.

58:14.956 --> 58:16.888
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

58:17.056 --> 58:19.352
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

58:19.523 --> 58:22.785
Stop jerking around before
I close you down for wasting my time.

58:28.522 --> 58:30.011
Wait here.

58:42.789 --> 58:43.811
You have weapon?

58:44.355 --> 58:45.412
You're holding it.

59:13.957 --> 59:15.445
Black, one sugar, please.

59:22.655 --> 59:23.781
What is it you want?

59:25.323 --> 59:26.949
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

59:27.124 --> 59:30.351
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

59:30.523 --> 59:33.683
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

59:33.856 --> 59:35.685
I'm here for the renegotiation.

59:39.523 --> 59:43.115
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

59:43.957 --> 59:48.185
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

59:48.357 --> 59:51.982
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

59:52.157 --> 59:55.487
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

59:55.657 --> 59:59.145
...of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

59:59.491 --> 01:00:00.889
And those costs have gone up.

01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:04.285
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's only logical.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.554
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

01:00:07.724 --> 01:00:09.518
Why do you want to know?

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.213
I was told Marko is in charge.

01:00:11.423 --> 01:00:13.151
We are all Marko.

01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:15.783
Marko from Tropoja.

01:00:15.957 --> 01:00:17.218
We are all from Tropoja.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:23.320
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

01:00:23.491 --> 01:00:27.718
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.612
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:33.280
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:36.447
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:39.215
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

01:00:39.425 --> 01:00:42.481
...and think because we are tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

01:00:42.858 --> 01:00:44.518
Your arrogance offends me.

01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:46.657
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

01:00:47.858 --> 01:00:50.949
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

01:00:52.924 --> 01:00:54.719
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

01:00:54.924 --> 01:00:57.686
And you have my word it'll not go up
for a year.

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.782
How do you say "sugar"
in your language?

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:25.353
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

01:01:25.558 --> 01:01:26.649
See you in a month.

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:34.785
A friend gave this to me.
It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:48.785
Good luck.

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:50.350
- Good luck.
- <i>Good luck.</i>

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.920
- <i>Good luck. Good luck.</i>
- Good luck.

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:04.485
You don't remember me.

01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:07.280
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

01:02:10.824 --> 01:02:12.290
I told you I would find you.

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:18.283
Kim.

01:03:32.627 --> 01:03:34.217
Amanda.

01:04:10.127 --> 01:04:11.185
Wake up!

01:04:11.726 --> 01:04:13.454
I need you to be focused.

01:04:16.627 --> 01:04:18.490
Are you focused yet?

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:29.486
Where is this girl?

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:31.855
Where is she?

01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:04.191
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

01:05:04.361 --> 01:05:06.986
But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...

01:05:07.161 --> 01:05:10.559
...had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

01:05:10.728 --> 01:05:13.057
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

01:05:13.228 --> 01:05:17.217
...and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to pulling fingernails.

01:05:17.428 --> 01:05:19.723
Acid drips on bare skin.

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:22.325
The whole exercise
would become counterproductive.

01:05:22.494 --> 01:05:24.153
But here, the power's stable.

01:05:24.327 --> 01:05:26.657
Here, there's a nice even flow.

01:05:26.827 --> 01:05:30.123
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

01:05:34.227 --> 01:05:35.557
Where is she?

01:05:56.461 --> 01:06:00.416
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

01:06:00.862 --> 01:06:03.157
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

01:06:03.328 --> 01:06:06.317
...till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

01:06:07.562 --> 01:06:08.822
Where is my daughter?

01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:12.816
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

01:06:13.027 --> 01:06:15.187
She was virgin, lot of money.

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:17.520
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

01:06:19.528 --> 01:06:21.153
To who?

01:06:21.862 --> 01:06:23.487
I don't know.

01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:27.825
- What?
- Saint-Clair.

01:06:28.329 --> 01:06:29.351
Saint-Clair.

01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:32.352
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

01:06:33.962 --> 01:06:36.985
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

01:06:37.162 --> 01:06:38.186
Patrice Saint-Clair.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.692
Where can I find him?

01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:43.491
I don't know, I don't know.

01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:46.988
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

01:06:47.195 --> 01:06:49.457
Please! I don't know!

01:06:49.629 --> 01:06:53.618
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

01:06:53.796 --> 01:06:55.625
Please.

01:06:55.796 --> 01:06:57.886
Not that. Please.

01:06:58.062 --> 01:06:59.459
I believe you.

01:07:02.295 --> 01:07:04.556
But it's not gonna save you.

01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:29.560
Look who dropped by.

01:07:30.362 --> 01:07:32.954
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

01:07:33.163 --> 01:07:34.186
Jean-Claude.

01:07:34.363 --> 01:07:36.828
The children waited up for you.

01:07:36.996 --> 01:07:40.326
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

01:07:40.497 --> 01:07:42.019
Bryan, will you do the honors?

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.128
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:16.788
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:19.122
...since you left the old job
for the new one.

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:22.126
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

01:08:22.296 --> 01:08:25.353
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:27.654
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:29.529
- Really?
- Yes.

01:08:29.698 --> 01:08:31.492
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

01:08:31.662 --> 01:08:34.323
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:35.827
Find anything interesting?

01:08:35.997 --> 01:08:39.792
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

01:08:40.697 --> 01:08:43.185
People there know someone
that works in your office.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.395
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

01:08:45.563 --> 01:08:47.823
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

01:08:47.996 --> 01:08:51.689
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

01:08:51.863 --> 01:08:53.693
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean-Claude.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.189
I know everything.

01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:58.191
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:02.394
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

01:09:02.563 --> 01:09:04.654
- Are you involved?
- Involved in what?

01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:06.785
What are you two talking about?

01:09:06.962 --> 01:09:10.555
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.787
As long as my family is provided for...

01:09:12.965 --> 01:09:15.555
...I do not care
where the difference comes from.

01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:17.629
That is my entire involvement.

01:09:17.798 --> 01:09:19.786
- What about my family?
- I told you...

01:09:19.964 --> 01:09:22.395
...I would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

01:09:22.564 --> 01:09:23.894
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

01:09:24.064 --> 01:09:27.553
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.

01:09:27.798 --> 01:09:29.024
Jean-Claude.

01:09:30.497 --> 01:09:32.157
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:34.127
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

01:09:34.363 --> 01:09:37.228
- No!
- No, I'm not.

01:09:41.965 --> 01:09:45.192
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

01:09:45.363 --> 01:09:47.828
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's loaded.

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:51.055
Isabelle!

01:09:52.497 --> 01:09:53.657
It's a flesh wound.

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:57.524
But if you don't get me what I need,
the last thing you'll see...

01:09:57.697 --> 01:09:59.687
...is the bullet
I put between her eyes.

01:09:59.865 --> 01:10:02.922
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

01:10:14.532 --> 01:10:16.326
You could've made this
less painful...

01:10:16.498 --> 01:10:20.625
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and less about your desk.

01:10:20.798 --> 01:10:23.128
Please apologize to your wife for me.

01:11:28.332 --> 01:11:31.196
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

01:11:31.365 --> 01:11:32.922
Your name, please.

01:11:36.932 --> 01:11:38.829
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the list.

01:11:38.998 --> 01:11:40.555
Oh, please check again.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.326
Inside.

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:34.159
May I help you, sir?

01:12:39.801 --> 01:12:42.289
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:55.329
<i>I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.</i>

01:12:57.134 --> 01:12:59.157
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

01:13:00.701 --> 01:13:03.962
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.960
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:11.226
<i>I have 150.</i>

01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.025
Your champagne, sir.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.493
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

01:13:17.666 --> 01:13:18.689
May I serve?

01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:20.231
- Please.
- <i>I have 250.</i>

01:13:22.066 --> 01:13:23.794
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:27.424
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.626
<i>The last item.</i>

01:13:47.967 --> 01:13:50.456
<i>As usual, we save the best for last.</i>

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:52.959
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

01:13:53.134 --> 01:13:54.566
<i>Certified pure.</i>

01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:05.523
- Sorry.
- Get out.

01:14:07.134 --> 01:14:09.862
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:15.459
<i>One hundred.</i>

01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:27.163
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

01:14:27.368 --> 01:14:29.527
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

01:14:29.701 --> 01:14:31.032
Buy her.

01:14:31.236 --> 01:14:32.326
<i>I have 100.</i>

01:14:34.068 --> 01:14:36.829
- Buy her.
- <i>One-fifty.</i>

01:14:37.034 --> 01:14:38.557
<i>Two hundred.</i>

01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:41.960
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:45.430
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

01:14:46.034 --> 01:14:48.227
<i>Four. Four.</i>

01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:51.200
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

01:14:51.435 --> 01:14:53.298
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

01:14:54.001 --> 01:14:55.058
<i>Four-fifty.</i>

01:14:56.235 --> 01:14:58.201
<i>Five hundred. Five hundred thousand.</i>

01:14:58.368 --> 01:15:02.356
<i>Five hundred thousand. Sold.</i>

01:15:02.834 --> 01:15:06.528
<i>That concludes the sales for tonight.</i>
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:09.968
- <i>You can collect your purchases directly.</i>
- Move.

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:14.159
- You will never get away with this.
- If you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

01:15:23.969 --> 01:15:26.434
Now, Mr?

01:15:32.636 --> 01:15:36.067
Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.300
It doesn't matter what we call you...

01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:43.934
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

01:15:45.302 --> 01:15:47.233
The last girl, I'm her father.

01:15:49.802 --> 01:15:52.927
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

01:15:54.235 --> 01:15:56.498
I wish I could, honestly.

01:15:56.668 --> 01:15:58.362
See, I'm a father myself.

01:15:58.535 --> 01:16:00.558
I have two sons and a daughter...

01:16:00.735 --> 01:16:03.725
...but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:05.231
This is a business.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:07.163
This is a very unique business...

01:16:07.336 --> 01:16:10.063
...with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.

01:16:10.302 --> 01:16:12.734
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.992
...discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:20.033
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:24.458
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

01:17:22.636 --> 01:17:25.000
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.829
...they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:47.071 --> 01:17:50.798
Okay, we can resolve this.
I know how you feel.

01:17:50.971 --> 01:17:53.630
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.631
You have no idea...

01:17:58.737 --> 01:17:59.964
- Where is she?
- Please.

01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:01.431
Understand. Please try...

01:18:06.137 --> 01:18:09.195
There's a boat by the quay.

01:18:10.438 --> 01:18:11.903
Please understand.

01:18:12.071 --> 01:18:16.435
It was all business,
it wasn't personal.

01:18:16.637 --> 01:18:18.365
It was all personal to me.

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.066
We can...

01:25:28.042 --> 01:25:31.736
- Daddy.
- Kim.

01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:34.636
You came for me.

01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:40.675
You came for me.

01:25:43.443 --> 01:25:45.500
I told you I would.

01:26:14.443 --> 01:26:17.568
<i>May I have your attention.</i>
<i>If you're waiting for oversized bags...</i>

01:26:19.076 --> 01:26:20.975
Mom.

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:24.677
Oh, my God.

01:26:25.077 --> 01:26:27.339
Oh, sweetie.

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:30.340
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

01:26:30.511 --> 01:26:32.443
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

01:26:33.811 --> 01:26:35.970
I've got everything I need.

01:26:36.144 --> 01:26:38.736
I love you so much.

01:26:40.878 --> 01:26:42.968
Stuart.

01:26:43.878 --> 01:26:45.866
Thank you.

01:26:53.144 --> 01:26:56.076
<i>Attention, travelers.</i>
<i>You are not required</i> to...

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.176
Shall we go?

01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:05.675
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:10.935
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.
- All right.

01:27:19.245 --> 01:27:21.437
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

01:27:44.544 --> 01:27:47.510
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

01:27:49.477 --> 01:27:51.444
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:54.378 --> 01:27:57.832
When someone says "hi,"
it's usually polite to say "hi" back.

01:27:58.577 --> 01:27:59.669
Hi.

01:27:59.844 --> 01:28:01.011
I heard you
wanna be a singer.

01:28:01.478 --> 01:28:03.238
- I do.
- She does.

01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:08.208
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.
