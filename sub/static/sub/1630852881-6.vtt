WEBVTT

00:51.093 --> 00:52.094
Graner.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.596
<i>We ran the data
from Kilmer's head like you asked.</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:57.266
<i>We found the signature from the console
they used to hack the chip.</i>

00:57.349 --> 00:59.268
Whose was it?

00:59.351 --> 01:00.519
<i>Ours.</i>

01:00.602 --> 01:02.229
<i>I think it's traceable to Reghabi</i> .

01:02.312 --> 01:04.772
- Reghabi.
- <i>Yep.</i>

01:04.857 --> 01:07.276
<i>She cracked reintegration. I'll find her.</i>

01:32.009 --> 01:35.345
"Tame in me the tempers four

01:37.014 --> 01:39.349
that I may serve thee evermore.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.021
Place in me the values nine

01:45.439 --> 01:48.317
that I may feel thy touch divine."

04:54.837 --> 04:56.171
Can I come in?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.965
Yeah. Yeah.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.518
You found this?

05:10.686 --> 05:11.979
A while back.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.733
I come here sometimes, just me.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.449
Now, I want to show it to you.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.119
It's beautiful.

05:29.204 --> 05:33.000
It could be just for us. Our secret place.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.336
Finally.

05:37.629 --> 05:41.592
What I mean to say is that
your O&D colleagues are very nice,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.218
but they're also…

05:43.302 --> 05:45.179
- Always around.
- Yes.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.189
Is this okay?

05:58.483 --> 06:04.573
Irving, you know, the Lumon manual doesn't
say anything about lip-to-lip contact.

06:05.616 --> 06:10.287
It does discourage
romantic fraternization, though.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.206
This can't be romantic then.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.375
No.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.215
Not romantic… at all?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.012
I'm truly sorry…

06:29.890 --> 06:31.099
I'm just not ready.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.479
I'm-- I'm sorry.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.152
It's fine.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.573
Just stay.

06:48.784 --> 06:52.079
Stay here with me.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.310
You did so good.

07:15.394 --> 07:19.439
Now we're gonna go home
and see if you'll eat. Please.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.509
Looks like we both made it through.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.511
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.264
Devon. From the retreat.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.558
I accosted you for your coffee.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.645
He's beautiful.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.022
He looks like a William.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.900
His name's Bradley, actually.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.068
Not William?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.448
- You changed it?
- Did we leave the juice boxes in the car?

08:10.324 --> 08:11.450
We must have, yeah.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.204
Hi. Angelo Arteta.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.997
I'm Devon. Nice to meet you.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.458
- Congratulations there.
- Oh, thank you.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.251
You two know each other?

08:21.335 --> 08:24.087
Yeah, I was-- We were--
met at the birthing cottages.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.134
- Nice to meet you too, Devon.
- Yeah. You too.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.347
Wow-kazow.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.642
We should go.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.229
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, you guys.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.313
Bye, Bradley.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.361
Declan, Kai, come on.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.697
What in the fuckity fuck?

08:51.949 --> 08:52.950
Sorry.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.287
<i>What does camaraderie mean?</i>

08:59.122 --> 09:02.459
<i>Most linguists agree
it comes from the Latin "camera,"</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:06.213
<i>which means
"a device used to take a photograph."</i>

09:07.714 --> 09:12.219
<i>And of course, the best photographs
are of groups of happy friends</i>

09:12.302 --> 09:13.846
<i>who love each other deeply.</i>

09:14.930 --> 09:19.268
<i>But I think camaraderie is more
than smiling together in photos.</i>

09:19.852 --> 09:22.521
<i>It's standing together in hard times.</i>

09:23.272 --> 09:27.025
<i>It's recognizing a common struggle
in another person</i>

09:27.860 --> 09:31.947
<i>and reaching out
to offer them a loving hand.</i>

09:36.743 --> 09:40.205
We should return to O&D immediately.

09:40.289 --> 09:41.790
All of us. Today.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.292
Someone's eager to fraternize.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.127
Fraternization has nothing to do with it.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.589
This could be the start
of us uniting the departments

09:48.672 --> 09:50.757
the way Kier always intended.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.634
Maybe his ghost can
officiate your wedding.

09:52.718 --> 09:55.804
This is inappropriate workplace
commentary. And I'm self-reporting you.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.056
You're reporting me to yourself?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.017
Okay. You said they were making things?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
Yes, in some kind of machines.
We didn't ask what.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.062
It's the clubs
they murder those goats with.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.147
Shut up.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.941
I agree with Irving.
O&D is the next piece of this.

10:08.025 --> 10:11.820
- Now, once we've mapped the whole floor--
- To be clear, I do not approve of mapping.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.697
Right.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.283
What if we go on
another "mental health walk"?

10:16.366 --> 10:17.367
Could be fun.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.038
What-- I don't know.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.541
I mean, we still
have a lot of work to do, so…

10:24.625 --> 10:25.834
Oh, right.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.838
The work is mysterious and important.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.052
That's good.
That sounds just like me.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.178
I know.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.182
Back to work, slackers.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.395
Praise Kier.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.023
Hey.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.234
Are you fraternizing too?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.986
What? No, I--

10:53.070 --> 10:56.907
I'm a leader who cares about his employees

10:56.990 --> 10:58.867
and takes their requests seriously.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.077
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.704
Look at you all dewy mouthed.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.831
- You never smile at me.
- He's right, Mark.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.043
You are sparing
with the facial encouragements.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.254
That's ridiculous. I smile all the time.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.505
Hey there.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.049
What are you all talking about?

11:15.759 --> 11:16.802
Just--

11:16.885 --> 11:17.886
- We're--
- Dis--

11:17.970 --> 11:20.305
- Discussing the--
- Yes, Mrs.--

11:20.389 --> 11:23.684
- Ms. Casey. Ms. Casey.
- Ms. Casey. Yeah.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.894
Wait, where is she?

11:28.480 --> 11:34.152
Part-time innies may not be as
socialized and sophisticated as yourself,

11:34.236 --> 11:37.656
but they still must be held accountable
for their actions.

11:38.240 --> 11:43.370
Ms. Casey was told to supervise Helly,
and she failed at that task.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.290
Because I snuck Helly out.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.709
I mean, if anyone should be
in the break room, it's me.

11:51.837 --> 11:52.921
Valiance.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.383
Not a core principle, but sweet.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.887
Who won't you go to the break room for?

12:02.306 --> 12:05.434
She's just a wellness counselor, Mark.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.769
Yes, but she shouldn't be punished.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.521
I mean, I thought Helly needed a walk.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.231
I mean, I'm allowed to do that.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.900
Just a walk?

12:13.525 --> 12:14.526
Yeah.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.451
Or were you sniffing around
other departments

12:22.534 --> 12:25.954
while your department falls
woefully below quota?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.498
She almost died.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.294
It's not your job
to play nursemaid to every new refiner.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.173
Okay, so what is my job?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.841
Are you really asking me that?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.260
Yeah.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.930
What is it we actually do here?

12:45.307 --> 12:48.268
We serve Kier, you child!

12:48.769 --> 12:54.691
And until you get that through
your mildewed little brain and hit quota,

12:55.275 --> 12:59.238
MDR's hallway privileges
are hereby revoked.

13:00.072 --> 13:05.202
So get your little ass back to your desk
and stay there until you're told to move.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.378
Goddamn tragedy for the ages.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.923
MDR will mourn the "will-they-won't-they"
energy shared by Ms. Casey and myself.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.007
Oh, yeah?

13:19.091 --> 13:21.260
And to think
I wore this nice-ass shirt for her today.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.639
When you picked that shirt,
you didn't know she existed.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.058
Well, maybe love transcends severance.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.227
- You think so?
- No.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.106
What about you and Mark?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.440
What?

13:35.524 --> 13:38.026
You two enjoy
sneaking off the other day?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.153
"Baby goats"?

13:41.405 --> 13:43.240
Why are you saying it like that?

13:45.492 --> 13:49.121
Are you implying that "baby goats" is
code for sex with Mark S.?

13:51.123 --> 13:52.666
Wow.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.336
Is "baby goats"
code for sex with Mark S.?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.338
No, they were actual goats.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.923
Why would we call it that?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.718
Okay. Yeah, I believe you.

14:02.801 --> 14:03.927
Mark.

14:05.804 --> 14:06.972
You find out what happened?

14:07.055 --> 14:09.099
She's in the break room.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.768
Shit. Is that because of us?

14:14.229 --> 14:17.357
And we're not allowed in the
outer hallways anymore till we hit quota,

14:17.441 --> 14:21.111
so no more interdepartmental visits!

14:23.822 --> 14:25.324
Are you serious?

14:30.662 --> 14:31.663
I'm…

14:33.582 --> 14:35.709
I'm sorry, Mark. It's-- It's my fault…

14:37.794 --> 14:43.133
that I've been setting a bad example
as the senior-most refiner.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.974
Which way did you say it was to O&D?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.332
Milchick!

15:15.415 --> 15:16.500
I'm on it.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.869
This is more people than I've ever seen.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.954
Same.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.333
It's okay.

15:58.417 --> 16:02.296
I know change can be disorienting,

16:02.880 --> 16:04.631
but MDR is here now.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.969
You are welcome here,

16:09.052 --> 16:14.683
much as I hope all of us will be welcome
to visit you at your place of endeavors.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.604
Now go on. Surely you must have
some questions for them.

16:24.193 --> 16:27.154
So, it's called Macrodata Refinement?

16:29.531 --> 16:31.158
What do you refine?

16:36.205 --> 16:37.372
Is that a watering can?

16:40.417 --> 16:45.172
We think it might be supplies
for the executive wing upstairs.

16:45.255 --> 16:49.635
Then again, last week's output had
more of an aggressive feel.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.094
The hatchets weren't aggressive.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.138
Hatchets?

16:54.556 --> 16:57.267
We've been trying to figure out
how it all fits together.

16:57.351 --> 17:01.271
We found a department
the opposite way from here

17:01.355 --> 17:05.150
that's, well, raising baby goats.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.736
Raising baby goats?

17:12.574 --> 17:17.454
There is a lot unknown to us as well,
but we keep plugging along.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.205
It's important work, obviously.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.916
Everything we do here is important.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.422
It's important because it actually is
or because you're saying it is?

17:30.050 --> 17:33.637
Look, maybe we should
work together on this.

17:35.514 --> 17:39.142
Together doing what, exactly?

17:39.226 --> 17:42.312
I don't know.
Finding out why there are goats.

17:42.396 --> 17:47.192
Or, you know, finding out
how big this place is

17:47.276 --> 17:48.944
or how many of us there are.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.744
I mean, why won't they tell us
what we're doing here?

17:58.704 --> 18:00.414
What-What are they so afraid of?

18:02.165 --> 18:06.545
If the Eagan philosophy is
illumination above all--

18:06.628 --> 18:08.505
Illumination beyond all.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.631
But yes.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.843
Then why doesn't that include us?

18:13.552 --> 18:18.515
Why are we down here
still working in the dark?

18:25.522 --> 18:27.316
That was poetic as shit, man.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.483
Thanks.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.154
Mark is right.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.323
- He is?
- He is.

18:34.406 --> 18:40.412
Irving, Kier would want us to feel
the warm embrace of knowledge and truth.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.415
That way we could be true partners
in his teachings.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.000
Exactly.

18:46.460 --> 18:50.756
I think, as the two department chiefs,

18:51.548 --> 18:55.719
Mark and I should make contact with this
goat department, see what they know.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.934
And we can each bring one aide-de-camp.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.209
We're not children, Mr. Milchick.
We didn't do anything wrong.

19:50.649 --> 19:55.529
<i>Kier, chosen one, Kier</i>

19:56.029 --> 20:01.326
<i>Kier, brilliant one, Kier</i>

20:01.410 --> 20:07.791
<i>Brings the bounty to the plain
Through the torment, through the rains</i>

20:08.375 --> 20:13.088
<i>Progress, knowledge
Show no fear</i>

20:13.881 --> 20:18.635
<i>Kier, chosen one</i>

20:18.719 --> 20:21.013
<i>Kier</i>

20:27.019 --> 20:31.523
I trusted you, and you abused that trust.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.986
Your inefficiency
and free-range chicken roaming

20:36.069 --> 20:38.864
is ultimately your responsibility.

20:47.331 --> 20:50.083
Escort him to the break room.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.365
I'm sorry.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.802
What happened to your hand?

22:26.346 --> 22:30.184
Apparently, I jammed my hand at work
replenishing a watercooler.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.977
Or at least that's what they tell me.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.604
Those jugs are very heavy.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.397
Indeed they are.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.690
Another merlot?

22:36.773 --> 22:37.774
I'm fine, thanks.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.068
I'm good with water, thank you.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.740
Have you seen the princess?

22:45.616 --> 22:47.659
No, not since her birth.

22:47.743 --> 22:49.870
But I did talk on the phone
with your sister.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.164
I don't know
how much she tells you about her--

22:52.247 --> 22:53.957
- Latching difficulties?
- Yes.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.752
I-I'm aware.
Maybe too aware. I don't know.

22:56.835 --> 23:00.297
Well, she just wanted
the names of some lactation consultants.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.300
Well, it's not something serious, is it?

23:03.383 --> 23:04.843
No. It's very common.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.721
Still, it's probably good
to get an expert opinion.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.223
I mean, from someone other than…

23:09.306 --> 23:11.767
- Ricken? Yes.
- …Ricken.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.938
Did you ever think about having kids?

23:18.023 --> 23:19.024
With Gemma?

23:20.484 --> 23:21.485
Yes.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.700
Yeah, we tried for a little while.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.911
It wasn't really working.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.623
We talked about adopting at one point,
but…

23:37.042 --> 23:41.505
I don't know. Then you think,
"Okay, this is the life you've been given.

23:42.130 --> 23:46.218
And, um, that's another life,
and you don't get that one.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.345
So do something with this."

23:50.597 --> 23:52.015
That's very healthy.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.726
Well, it's mostly stuff she said.

23:56.270 --> 23:59.648
She was very pragmatic.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.900
Always had a plan B.

24:01.984 --> 24:05.487
You know, one time we were supposed to go
on this camping trip and--

24:05.571 --> 24:07.990
Is it weird
that I'm talking about her right now?

24:08.073 --> 24:10.951
- I feel like--
- No, I think it's also healthy.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.287
Yeah, but we're on a date. I--

24:14.872 --> 24:16.540
I haven't walked out on you yet.

24:23.422 --> 24:28.594
You know, sometimes I think…
she'd want me to get off my ass.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.930
And sometimes I think
she's not worried about me at all.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.474
She's just pissed that she's dead.

24:37.853 --> 24:39.897
Sorry, I know this doesn't
totally make sense.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.025
She's a part of you.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.236
You know?
You can't just separate yourself--

24:46.320 --> 24:50.282
- Oh, no, but you can, Alexa.
- Oh, shit.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.492
With this exciting new procedure.

24:52.576 --> 24:54.953
- Walked right into that.
- Yes, you did.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.333
- Love?
- Yeah?

25:43.377 --> 25:44.586
- She's here.
- Yeah.

25:49.633 --> 25:52.803
Careful. Watch your step.
Right this way.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.306
- Love it.
- Okay. My girl. There's my girl.

25:59.518 --> 26:00.811
Okay.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.398
You must be Devon.

26:04.481 --> 26:05.983
Devon, this is Mrs. Selvig.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.236
Hi. Yeah, and you're Mark's neighbor.
Thanks so much for meeting with us.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.988
Oh, it's a privilege.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.740
I went giddy when Mark mentioned
you were looking for someone.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.702
- So serendipitous.
- I know.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.245
The kelp worked, huh?

26:18.912 --> 26:21.540
And this must be little Eleanor.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.542
Hello, little Eleanor.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.589
- You had a vaginal birth, yes?
- Oh, yeah.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.632
We should talk about
different nursing positions.

26:30.716 --> 26:32.259
Oh, and I brought you this.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.971
Shea butter salve for your nipples.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.055
It's on the house.

26:37.556 --> 26:39.516
- We are talking to a few candidates.
- Of course.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.268
Oh, here we go.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.936
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Yeah.

26:43.020 --> 26:47.441
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
That's what babies do.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.859
May I?

26:48.942 --> 26:49.943
Yeah, yeah.

26:52.237 --> 26:54.156
Darling.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.950
There, there, there. Okay.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.189
…seventy hundred one,

27:27.856 --> 27:29.983
seventy hundred two,

27:30.609 --> 27:32.945
seventy hundred forty-three,

27:33.737 --> 27:36.740
seventy hundred forty-six,

27:36.823 --> 27:40.285
seventy hundred forty-eight…

27:42.079 --> 27:43.121
Dylan.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.793
I've awoken you at home.
I need to know where you put it.

27:48.836 --> 27:49.962
Where I put what?

27:50.045 --> 27:51.797
The ideographic card you took from O&D.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.632
I saw the footage of you taking it.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.843
Did you smuggle it out? Is it here?

27:55.926 --> 27:57.469
Holy shit, is this my house?

27:57.553 --> 28:00.889
Dylan, listen. You have no idea
how sensitive this information is.

28:01.974 --> 28:04.309
If someone paid you
to smuggle out that card--

28:04.393 --> 28:06.436
No, no. I just--
I put it in the bathroom.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.146
Second stall, behind the toilet.

28:08.230 --> 28:09.273
Thank you.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.607
I didn't even know what it was.

28:10.691 --> 28:12.359
- That's fine too.
- Daddy.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.027
Daddy.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.280
Wh-- What the fuck?

28:16.363 --> 28:19.950
We told you to count to a thousand
and wait outside.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.201
Is that my kid?

28:22.411 --> 28:23.412
End it.

28:29.334 --> 28:30.335
Daddy.

28:35.883 --> 28:36.884
We good here?

28:37.718 --> 28:38.719
We're good.

28:48.395 --> 28:51.440
So, should we--

28:52.024 --> 28:53.609
We should probably call our cars.

28:55.819 --> 28:56.820
Yeah.

29:02.451 --> 29:03.452
Oh, wow.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.456
That's June.

29:09.041 --> 29:12.127
Hey, this is tonight. Like, right now.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.756
Should-- Should we go to this, maybe?

29:16.590 --> 29:17.591
What is it?

29:18.425 --> 29:21.887
Well, it's this band.
I-- I kind of know one of them.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.973
If it's lame, we'll leave.

29:25.474 --> 29:27.559
You mean
if it isn't as cool as we are.

29:29.311 --> 29:30.312
Exactly.

29:40.656 --> 29:44.076
I am feeling very old right now.

29:44.159 --> 29:46.995
No, you totally fit in.
Don't worry about it.

29:56.421 --> 29:59.299
Hi. Two beers, please.

30:03.971 --> 30:04.972
Hello.

30:06.515 --> 30:07.516
Thank you.

30:11.103 --> 30:16.358
Hi. Who's doing sound
in this alleyway tonight? It's terrible.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.235
All right, let's get this over with.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.749
<i>Summer rain
As I work these days</i>

30:32.833 --> 30:35.794
<i>I feel a callus on my heart
'Cause every day's the same</i>

30:35.878 --> 30:38.338
<i>Broken heart, broken spirit</i>

30:39.047 --> 30:41.175
<i>Skylark's fires smash a window…</i>

30:43.468 --> 30:44.553
No filming, you fuck.

30:44.636 --> 30:45.679
Sure, thank you.

30:45.762 --> 30:50.559
<i>You can make this all come true
Build a sky in my eye that perfect blue</i>

30:50.642 --> 30:53.145
<i>I hate you, Lumon
You took my first love</i>

30:53.228 --> 30:55.981
<i>Fuck you, Lumon, it's never enough</i>

30:56.064 --> 30:59.693
<i>You think that you can fight me
You are wrong to even try me</i>

31:00.694 --> 31:02.321
Fuck you, Lumon!

31:03.238 --> 31:04.656
I hate you, Lumon!

31:06.450 --> 31:07.993
Fuck you, Lumon!

31:13.832 --> 31:16.543
<i>Fuck you, Lumon
You took my first love</i>

31:16.627 --> 31:19.463
<i>I hate you, Lumon
It's never enough</i>

31:19.546 --> 31:20.672
Fuck you, Lumon.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.092
I hate you, Lumon!

31:25.385 --> 31:27.429
Fuck you, Lumon!

31:27.513 --> 31:29.515
I hate you, Lumon!

31:29.598 --> 31:32.267
What's happening?
This is depraved.

31:32.935 --> 31:33.936
Hi.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.647
Hey, I'm…

31:36.730 --> 31:38.941
- The guy from work.
- Yeah.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.862
How are you holding up?

31:49.743 --> 31:51.954
Sorry. This is my friend, Alexa.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.705
This is June.

31:53.789 --> 31:56.041
- Hey. You guys are really good.
- Yeah.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.877
Are we? I'm pretty sure we suck.

31:58.961 --> 32:00.671
Well, that last song was great.

32:02.047 --> 32:04.091
- Write what you know, right?
- Yeah.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.428
Your dad would've really liked it, I bet.

32:09.513 --> 32:10.931
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.600
How the fuck would you even know that?

32:13.684 --> 32:16.270
Hey, fuck you, man.

32:19.189 --> 32:20.858
I think we're gonna take off.

32:21.483 --> 32:22.568
Yeah.

32:31.702 --> 32:32.953
So…

32:35.372 --> 32:39.668
she's the daughter
of someone I worked with.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.212
He died.

32:42.296 --> 32:47.092
And it's--
It's been difficult to piece toge--

33:07.112 --> 33:08.113
Harmony.

33:09.156 --> 33:10.240
Did you find her?

33:10.324 --> 33:13.327
I got a tip from a campus cop
at Ganz College.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.913
She-- What the fuck are you wearing?

33:17.623 --> 33:20.459
I was doing some private research.

33:21.293 --> 33:22.920
What's that a euphemism for?

33:24.546 --> 33:26.048
Doug, I've had a day.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.468
And I'm still trying to figure out

33:29.551 --> 33:33.805
what part of this conversation
couldn't have happened on the phone.

33:34.389 --> 33:37.267
Someone's holed up
in one of Ganz's old lab buildings.

33:37.351 --> 33:39.686
The dean's told security
to look the other way.

33:40.521 --> 33:42.397
Probably is Reghabi.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.732
It is her.

33:44.775 --> 33:46.235
Wanna come with me and find out?

33:47.236 --> 33:49.279
No, I do not.

33:50.030 --> 33:51.657
Let me know when you have her.

33:52.783 --> 33:55.244
Oh, maintenance is installing tonight.

33:55.327 --> 33:56.745
I think it's a good call.

33:59.206 --> 34:02.501
So, you're like a nurse or something?

35:16.617 --> 35:17.618
Hello?

35:18.869 --> 35:20.078
<i>Who is this?</i>

35:26.627 --> 35:28.003
A friend of Petey's.

35:35.511 --> 35:39.681
Hello? Are-- Are you there?

35:41.642 --> 35:42.893
<i>Is this Mark Scout?</i>

35:48.941 --> 35:50.776
<i>What did he tell you before he died?</i>

35:52.444 --> 35:53.779
Nothing.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.364
I just--

35:57.032 --> 35:58.992
I-I-I-- I wanna--

36:01.578 --> 36:03.080
I wanna understand.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.043
<i>Can you meet me now?</i>

38:08.705 --> 38:09.831
Are you alone?

38:16.505 --> 38:18.006
Yeah, it's just me.

38:22.678 --> 38:24.596
I used to teach at this school.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.681
I know.

38:29.893 --> 38:30.894
Who are you?

38:36.275 --> 38:37.276
Come with me.
