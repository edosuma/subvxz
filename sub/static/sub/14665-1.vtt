A FILMMAKERS R&K PRODUCTION

01:10.612 --> 01:12.698
That's the one!

01:16.410 --> 01:17.451
Hey!

01:17.452 --> 01:18.911
Not that one!

01:18.912 --> 01:20.454
That's not the one!

01:20.455 --> 01:21.707
Come on!

01:25.544 --> 01:27.588
I sure spoiled you good.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.090
Just you wait.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.884
I'll find a car that's
just right for you. Alright?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.429
Alright.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.390
- I'll take care of you for life.
- Welcome!

01:39.391 --> 01:41.309
You can't find a better deal.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.935
- This way.
- I'll come next time.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.187
Come again.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.608
Good afternoon!

01:47.899 --> 01:49.151
For the gentleman or Mrs.?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.902
Mrs.? What the fuck?

01:51.194 --> 01:52.279
Let's go, baby.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.656
Where are you going?

01:57.951 --> 01:58.827
Hey, honey.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.369
What about your mother?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.789
I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.542
That place is for married people
and we're for lovers.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.962
See the cars we have?

02:09.254 --> 02:10.963
Look at that Mercedes!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.298
Mercedes indeed.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.092
She'll be driving it.
So, no petty troubles.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.469
Can I see the engine?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.971
You know your cars, don't you?

02:18.263 --> 02:18.972
Yang!

02:22.184 --> 02:25.478
The lady who sold this car
bought it for her son-in-law

02:25.479 --> 02:26.647
and didn't drive it once.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.440
See the low mileage?

02:28.940 --> 02:31.401
Son-in-law got a fancy job in the States.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.070
Can't come back to Korea.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.865
My cutie pie.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.662
You look like a proper
lady in that car.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.079
Shall we go with this one?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.373
I suppose this'll do for my groceries.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.667
You, groceries, sure... Come here.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.835
What's the matter with you?! Nasty!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.922
So you know your girls, too.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.800
I'll take it out for a spin.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.971
AUTO TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATION

03:02.724 --> 03:05.476
You checked the registration
and navigation?

03:05.477 --> 03:06.728
Yes.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.364
Thank you!

03:17.656 --> 03:19.157
Enjoy your ride.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.161
Let's get to work.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.878
Hey, watch the signal!

03:32.879 --> 03:35.799
Wait for the next light!
Son of a...!

03:37.175 --> 03:40.470
Easy... easy!
This isn't your damn car!

03:40.887 --> 03:44.808
And couldn't you act more naturally?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.017
Check if we've got a tail!

03:47.018 --> 03:50.020
I am checking!
Stop nagging already!

03:50.021 --> 03:53.524
Focus on your driving! Are you nuts?!

03:53.525 --> 03:54.942
Look ahead, damn it!

03:54.943 --> 03:57.154
Why don't you take
the goddamn wheel?!

03:57.904 --> 03:58.821
What does he want now?

03:58.822 --> 03:59.530
CHIEF

03:59.531 --> 04:02.032
Breathing down my neck again!

04:02.033 --> 04:03.784
Text if you can't call!

04:03.785 --> 04:05.411
I gave you specific instructions!

04:05.412 --> 04:07.246
Do you have the brains of a goldfish?!

04:07.247 --> 04:10.833
You've got zero patience.
I was just about to call you.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.919
I'm sick of your excuses!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.671
With all that smooth talking,
you should've become a lawyer!

04:15.672 --> 04:16.882
We got the car!

04:17.048 --> 04:18.424
Watch the lane, dumbass!

04:18.425 --> 04:21.761
Chief, don't put me on an assignment
with him again! We're a bad team!

04:21.762 --> 04:24.388
A bad team? You haven't seen bad.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.308
Don't start with me! I've got the wheel!
I'll show you bad.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.268
Stop screwing around.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.773
S0 is this happening or
are we dragging some more?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.984
Dragging on for three
months is enough!

04:36.985 --> 04:37.986
We're on tonight!

04:59.216 --> 05:00.133
Hey...

05:00.383 --> 05:01.843
Isn't that your car?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.851
We're on...

05:10.560 --> 05:11.853
Shit!

05:12.062 --> 05:13.729
Did you say "shit" to me?

05:13.730 --> 05:16.733
I said no talking with
food in your mouth.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.443
What about Do-Cheol?

05:18.944 --> 05:19.861
Yeah?

05:20.779 --> 05:21.612
Boys!

05:21.613 --> 05:23.114
We're on. Let's go!

05:23.865 --> 05:25.617
Oh, come on!

05:26.409 --> 05:27.452
Come on, move.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.249
Can I get a refund for
what we didn't finish?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.960
But you ate the food.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.171
Get outta here!

06:24.134 --> 06:27.052
Take out the equipment.
Speed it up.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.432
Let me get the GPS tracker
from the trunk.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.270
Thank God! I thought
I was gonna die in there.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.064
Where's the toilet?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.944
Who the fuck are you?!

06:48.533 --> 06:50.076
What the heck?!

06:52.412 --> 06:54.414
I almost pissed my pants!

06:54.789 --> 06:56.458
What took you so long?!

06:56.708 --> 06:59.419
I know you. You're that guy...

06:59.711 --> 07:00.544
from earlier.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.297
Good going, guys-

07:02.589 --> 07:04.131
I see you haven't met my team yet.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.009
I said, what the fuck?!

07:07.969 --> 07:08.762
Hello?

07:09.179 --> 07:10.512
Where are you?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.890
Who the fuck are you?!

07:12.891 --> 07:13.600
What?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.476
At a gas station?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.896
You didn't fill up before a standby?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.689
Are you kidding me?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.609
Hurry up! I'm starving!

07:25.403 --> 07:26.696
You know how to wear them?

07:26.863 --> 07:29.491
Which gang are you from?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.286
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.246
You'll get hurt.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.177
Oh my...

08:15.078 --> 08:16.371
Are you fucking insane?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.734
- Let's go home!
- Nobody moves!

08:46.234 --> 08:49.820
- Ladies!
- Why are you rolling about?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.571
Is the car alright?

08:50.572 --> 08:53.824
This is why they call you a blocker
who never gets promoted.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.994
You should ask
if anyone's hurt first.

08:56.828 --> 08:57.537
Shit!

08:57.704 --> 08:58.412
Is this the guy?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.622
Get up, you punk!

08:59.914 --> 09:01.291
I want a lawyer!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.006
Let's go.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.052
I forgot that I had to make a call.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.802
What was his number...

09:13.803 --> 09:18.308
Stay put until I come back, okay?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.310
Oh, and...

09:20.810 --> 09:23.563
I can't cover your ass
if you cripple another man.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.357
Yes, I'm talking about that time.

09:26.649 --> 09:30.403
The poor bastard needs
a bib when he eats.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.822
Gets so happy when he's fed.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.951
You became a cop
to beat people up, didn't you?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.280
Come here.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.865
It's alright. Hold this.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.451
With both hands. That's it.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.745
You can't hit a cop.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.289
Especially with a weapon.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.456
What?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.918
Now, put down the evidence.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.423
This is called self-defense.
You fucking asshole!

10:33.591 --> 10:34.925
No need to get physical!

10:34.926 --> 10:36.552
We can talk this out!

10:36.553 --> 10:37.887
Let go of it.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.558
- Sit properly-
- Okay.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.768
Where are the cars sent from here?

10:44.769 --> 10:45.603
To Busan.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.481
- My questions may not be orderly...
- Yes.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.859
But I like long, structured answers.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.777
Yes, sir.

10:53.069 --> 10:53.778
So...

10:54.154 --> 10:56.239
The cars are not just
from Seoul. Correct?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.409
Just a nod?
What am I, your mate?

10:59.784 --> 11:00.827
What after Busan?

11:01.035 --> 11:02.119
They're sent to Russia.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.246
Russia?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.332
Russians come to the scene?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.917
You got the picture.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.506
Let's go eat, Chief!

11:16.009 --> 11:18.218
What a mess.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.847
Why isn't he in bed yet?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.807
Ask him yourself.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.101
What's with the attitude?
I just got home from work.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.228
Here. I got some chicken.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.273
Don't dump your jacket on the floor!
I have a full time job, too.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.525
Alright, alright!

11:33.526 --> 11:34.777
What's the matter with you?

11:35.278 --> 11:36.988
Something happened
at the welfare center?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.364
My work is fine.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.534
If there's anything wrong,
it's your son.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.037
Why? What happened?

11:44.329 --> 11:46.288
He beat up a classmate.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.707
You scared me for a second there.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.086
That's how kids grow up.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.340
Son, you can't be sleeping here.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.260
Just don't go around getting beat up.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.138
That is not acceptable.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.559
Good for you.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.228
Mom's a social worker, dad's a cop...

12:09.229 --> 12:10.896
And you're gonna
have a thug for a son?

12:10.897 --> 12:14.651
Can't you talk with more elegance?

12:14.943 --> 12:17.153
I'm working on a solid case.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.406
They'll call you "ma'am"
when I get into the central office.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.908
Let's go to bed, son.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.160
Find your seal before
you transfer to the central office.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.203
What for?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.329
The loan renewal.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.164
What loan?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.500
Loan for our rent deposit! What else?!

12:31.918 --> 12:33.878
You don't have to shout.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.257
Get more loans and
buy the damn house!

12:37.423 --> 12:39.133
Wash your damn feet!

12:40.802 --> 12:41.886
Urgh!

12:42.178 --> 12:47.178
A real man doesn't give a shit
about things like loans.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.102
Go big!

12:50.103 --> 12:51.729
What's there to life?

12:57.652 --> 13:00.612
Where did I put my seal?

13:00.613 --> 13:05.660
Could've bought a house
with all the interest payments.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.497
It's quite a distance.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.792
I'm sorry we can't pay more
because it's official business.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.547
Daily wage earners like us will
take any work, big or small.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.384
Mr. Bae, why isn't he at school?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.386
He went in the morning.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.346
I'm doing this so
I can send him to school.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.057
But I still can't afford
after-school tuitions.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.020
Still slow in the trucking business?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.313
For us,

13:33.604 --> 13:37.774
what's more important is
to deal with the right contractors.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.987
What's the use if you don't get paid?

13:41.571 --> 13:43.406
There are still bastards
who don't pay up?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.949
Just how the world is.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.786
They don't bat an eye before
firing someone after 20 years.

13:48.995 --> 13:49.787
Anyway...

13:50.079 --> 13:52.373
nothing dangerous today?

13:53.041 --> 13:56.502
Nothing of the sort.
You just need to drop off the car.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.338
I'm not worried about me

13:58.880 --> 14:00.381
but I am about the truck.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.636
These days, people don't care
about people getting hurt.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.850
Back off.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.518
- Hey, Kang.
- Yes, sir.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.688
How do you communicate
with the Russians?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.399
They speak Korean fluently.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.487
These days, you gotta
learn and develop yourself.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.989
Even those scumbags expand
territories by speaking another language.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.867
I'm too old to learn anything,

14:28.159 --> 14:33.159
but you should study regularly instead of
cramming before the promotion exam.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.624
I don't expect tuition support.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.502
Just give us some free time.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.294
You go clubbing
whenever you have time.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.671
A lot of people learn
English at the club.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.298
Right?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.008
Sorry?

14:44.509 --> 14:46.177
Get a job at the club then.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.221
I have connections, you know.

14:49.222 --> 14:53.142
They'll be long gone
by the time you get out.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.812
That's the fun part of going to prison.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.947
Now the real work begins for you.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.614
Thank you for looking me up.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.075
Have a safe trip back.

15:10.076 --> 15:16.457
The accounts team will
wire the payment today.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.584
The police wouldn't
withhold on payment.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.836
- Sure.
- Take care.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.338
One second, Mr. Bae!

15:22.630 --> 15:25.757
If there are assholes
who refuse to pay, give me a call.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.968
I mean it.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.301
I'll see you.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.137
Okay.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.138
Hey, big guy!

15:30.638 --> 15:33.933
Buy yourself a snack at the rest area.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.560
- You shouldn't.
- It's alright.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.689
A man's gotta be quick on his feet.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.065
Say, thank you.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.108
Thank you.

15:43.109 --> 15:43.900
Alright!

15:43.901 --> 15:45.152
I'll buy a drink
when you come back.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.028
Sounds good!

16:11.971 --> 16:15.016
Hey, what's up!

16:15.933 --> 16:17.517
The rendezvous is on.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.769
It's been a while.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.647
You look more fit.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.941
Hello.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.237
We got four good ones.
It's no joke.

16:28.529 --> 16:33.826
Mercedes S Class.
Check out the mileage.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.078
No distractions around.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.457
Just the main players checking goods.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.132
Looks like it's ready to be served.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.928
Okay, let's sign the papers.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.234
Contract signed, nice and neat!

17:07.235 --> 17:09.569
Let's get to work, ladies!

17:09.570 --> 17:12.657
Don't let your guards down!

17:13.199 --> 17:15.743
<i>Don't rush. Backup is on the way.</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:17.578
<i>Everyone, hold your positions.</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:19.372
<i>Nobody gets away.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:23.626
Great job! Beautifully done!

17:28.130 --> 17:29.339
What the fuck?!

17:29.340 --> 17:30.550
Run!

17:37.848 --> 17:39.350
You're dead meat.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.529
If you're gonna run,
run together in a group!

17:54.365 --> 17:55.908
<i>Hey, Do-Cheol!</i>

17:56.200 --> 17:57.410
Go after the Russians.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.411
What?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.412
Cut me some slack!

18:00.413 --> 18:02.248
Sure. Now, go!

18:02.540 --> 18:04.833
The others are running into the net!

18:04.834 --> 18:05.501
BUSAN CONTROL ROOM

18:11.090 --> 18:11.841
Bastard!

18:12.633 --> 18:15.928
How long are you gonna
run?! I'm so tired!

18:16.429 --> 18:17.429
Come with me now!

18:17.430 --> 18:18.639
No!

18:19.015 --> 18:20.308
Stop following me!

18:20.558 --> 18:22.226
I'm tired, too!

18:23.811 --> 18:24.812
Hey, stop!

18:26.439 --> 18:28.858
Take me, too! Come on!

18:32.028 --> 18:33.279
Come here!

18:34.030 --> 18:35.031
You little punk.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.536
Freeze, you bastard!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.173
You piece of shit!

18:57.803 --> 18:58.971
What the...?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.647
Miss Bong!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.107
Should've requested backup.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.360
We can't cover this large area.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.447
Sitting in front of the monitor,
bossing around...

19:16.947 --> 19:17.948
Holy shit!

19:18.240 --> 19:19.200
Hey!

19:25.498 --> 19:26.832
Damn...

19:28.918 --> 19:30.753
You bastard!

19:32.838 --> 19:33.755
Stop!

19:33.756 --> 19:35.299
Stop, you bastard!

19:50.648 --> 19:51.399
Hey...

19:51.774 --> 19:53.150
Go away.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.528
Just go.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.030
Go away... shoo!

20:01.659 --> 20:03.577
Let go, you shitsky!

20:06.163 --> 20:08.207
Let go. That hurts.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.917
You punk.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.837
Who do you think you are?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.505
Stand up straight.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.716
Stand straight, you bastard!

20:26.559 --> 20:27.727
Pissing me off...

20:32.022 --> 20:34.442
Aren't you tired? Hop on.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.152
Water?

20:37.445 --> 20:38.612
Thanks.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.907
I've got tons of work
waiting for me.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.076
Let's just go together.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.957
Okay, let's do that.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.332
Good thinking.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.211
We'll have a fun ride back
with your friends.

20:55.838 --> 20:56.797
Let's go!

21:14.774 --> 21:15.940
Hey, Kim.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.401
I'm here. Where are you?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.696
Over here.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.700
Let's finish up quickly and grab a drink.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.453
Attention!

21:28.454 --> 21:29.997
Write here!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.582
One, name!

21:32.583 --> 21:33.875
Two, first name!

21:33.876 --> 21:35.585
Three... country!

21:35.586 --> 21:37.630
You fuckers...

21:38.339 --> 21:39.714
How do I look?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.175
Pretty enough. Let's go.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.593
Reporters are asking
if they can come in.

21:43.594 --> 21:44.887
Tell them I'll be right down.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.055
Is that all the evidence?

21:47.056 --> 21:48.598
All ready to go.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.141
How do I scratch my back?

21:50.142 --> 21:53.353
We've got news cameras.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.439
Cover your faces if you're feeling shy.

21:55.731 --> 21:59.234
What do we do with
the Cro Cop and Fedor?

21:59.235 --> 22:01.070
Where's the interpreter?

22:01.362 --> 22:02.613
I speak Korean!

22:02.905 --> 22:04.198
Call my lawyer!

22:04.615 --> 22:06.616
Where did you learn
to speak like that?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.618
Do you still want an interpreter?

22:08.619 --> 22:13.081
Of course. It'll make a better picture.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.167
Just get an officer that speaks English.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.085
Let's go.

22:17.086 --> 22:20.755
Promotion is here.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.300
Carve my name on a desk
at the central office.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.136
So good! It's promotion time.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.348
Good times ahead.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.893
<i>Where's Deon?!</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:35.771
HEY, miss!

22:36.063 --> 22:38.315
If you cover for him,

22:38.607 --> 22:40.400
it makes you just as bad a person!

22:40.401 --> 22:42.569
I can't reach him either.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.361
You bitch!

22:43.362 --> 22:44.488
Come on!

22:44.822 --> 22:48.658
How can you terminate the contract
just because we joined a union?!

22:48.659 --> 22:51.035
If only you'd paid us on time!

22:51.036 --> 22:53.372
We spent our own money
for fuel and food!

22:53.664 --> 22:57.126
Stop harassing me.
I also work on a salary!

22:58.794 --> 23:00.129
I'll kill you all!

23:12.099 --> 23:13.267
You're still up?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.980
Go to bed or your mom'll get mad.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.276
I just ate. I'll be on my way.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.736
Tell mom that I'll be home soon.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.821
Bye now.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.115
I just need a second.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.159
Mr. Jeon!

23:33.704 --> 23:34.747
Bae...

23:36.415 --> 23:37.541
What are you doing here?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.543
You've been avoiding my calls.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.045
When did I do that?

23:42.046 --> 23:43.130
You called me?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.714
You never pick up.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.009
The office won't connect you.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.886
You dipshit...

23:49.470 --> 23:52.097
Cut the small talk.
Just tell me what you want.

23:52.723 --> 23:53.973
Let's not curse.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.975
You're making me.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.561
What do you want with me?

23:58.729 --> 24:02.858
How can you terminate
by a text message?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.360
Did I fire you?

24:04.652 --> 24:07.112
I get orders from headquarters.
What can I do?

24:07.488 --> 24:09.990
Why did you join the union?

24:10.199 --> 24:11.450
Are you all communists?

24:11.992 --> 24:15.829
You should at least
give us what you owe.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.292
Take it then.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.337
If there is anything to take, take it all.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.339
Take it, you bastard!

24:25.631 --> 24:26.965
Let's talk.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.300
I am talking. Did I hit you?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.678
Then get a medical certificate.

24:30.928 --> 24:33.054
How many times did I tell you?

24:33.055 --> 24:36.433
Go talk to headquarters.
I have no money!

24:37.142 --> 24:39.769
I don't even have money for the motel.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.938
So, I had to bring the girl
to the container.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.691
Can't you see?!

24:44.608 --> 24:45.943
For crying out loud...

24:46.568 --> 24:48.153
Look at you...

24:48.904 --> 24:51.031
Can't believe this.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.950
Get in!

25:12.970 --> 25:16.139
SEO DO-CHEOL, DETECTIVE
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

25:16.140 --> 25:19.351
Is this the right place?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.477
- Why isn't he picking up?
- Hey buddy!

25:21.478 --> 25:23.479
I called you a thousand times.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.230
Come on in.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.732
- Can you valet here?
- Of course.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.567
But they won't park my car!

25:27.568 --> 25:29.028
I'll talk to the guy. Come on.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.488
"The Female Detective"!

25:31.864 --> 25:34.073
An after party for a TV show?

25:34.074 --> 25:35.366
You sure I can join?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.535
Of course. You were the consultant.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.996
- Hey.
- Hello.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.748
Is she an actress?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.458
Don't act like a country boy.
There are more downstairs.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.167
Really?

25:44.168 --> 25:46.502
We've got a killer sponsor.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.797
I called so you can
network with the big players.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.884
You only stand to gain
from listening to me.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.886
Hang on.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.554
Take it if it's urgent.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.266
I don't know this number.
A reporter maybe?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.728
<i>Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message...</i>

26:08.567 --> 26:10.861
Wow... nice!

26:11.195 --> 26:13.321
Hello! Hi!

26:13.322 --> 26:15.741
- Someone you know?
- No.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.621
Hello... hi!

26:21.622 --> 26:23.748
This is beyond my dreams.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.625
Thanks, man.

26:25.626 --> 26:29.838
We didn't even get started.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.099
Director Cho!

26:40.432 --> 26:42.226
Come and say hi.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.562
Hi, I'm Seo Do-Cheol.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.148
Nice to meet...

26:49.525 --> 26:50.275
Ready?

26:51.652 --> 26:53.821
Did you place your bets?

26:54.613 --> 26:55.531
Fight!

27:01.495 --> 27:03.247
Put some weight behind it, damn it!

27:11.797 --> 27:12.840
Oh, come on!

27:13.132 --> 27:14.006
Get out!

27:14.007 --> 27:14.842
No fun.

27:15.509 --> 27:16.218
What the heck?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.136
Just playing!

27:18.137 --> 27:21.430
Gentlemen, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.807
It's alright. Come on.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.892
Have a seat, everyone.

27:24.309 --> 27:28.020
He helped out when Da-Hye
had a dispute with her agency

27:28.021 --> 27:31.440
and acted as our consultant
for this detective drama.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.110
Freeze or I'll shoot!

27:33.360 --> 27:36.363
Give it up for Detective Seo Do-Cheol!

27:37.322 --> 27:38.614
Nice to meet you.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.869
He's a great guy, well worth knowing.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.121
This guy's a plastic surgeon
with a practice in Gangnam.

27:45.122 --> 27:49.376
A breast specialist, Doctor Kim!

27:50.002 --> 27:53.213
This brother has a big resort business.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.631
The nature destroyer, Mr. Lee!

27:55.632 --> 27:56.549
Please.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.927
And the party's guest of honor.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.180
A trusty supporter of
my entertainment company,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.557
soon to be president of Sin Jin Tradings,

28:04.558 --> 28:06.809
The Director of Strategy

28:06.810 --> 28:08.436
Cho Tae-Oh!

28:08.437 --> 28:10.771
- Cho Tae-Oh!
- Is it the same Sin Jin I know?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.232
Please...

28:12.649 --> 28:14.610
We're just having fun here. Relax.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.612
How do you know Yun?

28:17.237 --> 28:21.532
We met him in the States
while on Da-Hye's shoot.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.286
I took them out
to dinner once. That's all.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.747
As you can tell, I'm
much younger than him.

28:28.749 --> 28:32.586
What an honor to drink
with the super rich.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.380
I thought they would party
differently somehow.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.019
Don't.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.026
Stop it!

29:02.950 --> 29:04.743
Did you expect
something more like this?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.506
I'm sorry for disappointing you!

29:18.215 --> 29:20.549
This is all there is to the super rich!

29:20.550 --> 29:22.052
Please forgive me!

29:35.732 --> 29:38.150
Wow, can't trick this detective.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.736
A real veteran.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.656
So cool! So tough!

29:46.451 --> 29:48.161
Did I scare you, baby?

29:52.082 --> 29:55.752
My grandfather used to say,
befriend those with nerves of steel.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.547
Hey, Yun...

29:58.839 --> 30:00.757
This Mr. Cho is quite interesting.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.887
Tae-Oh,

30:07.931 --> 30:09.558
don't get yourself into trouble.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.686
Let's have a toast.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.027
FITNESS CENTER

30:21.028 --> 30:24.572
Why drag me down here so early?

30:24.573 --> 30:26.490
What's the matter with you?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.118
It's not like I want to do this.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.247
There's gonna be a physical test
in the promotion exam.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.707
Morning!

30:33.999 --> 30:35.416
During the personnel evaluation period,

30:35.417 --> 30:37.753
you don't know who's
gonna be hung out to dry.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.297
Are you on the management level?

30:41.214 --> 30:44.968
How come you don't know shit
about the fundamentals?

30:45.677 --> 30:46.636
Morning, sir!

30:46.928 --> 30:48.597
- You've exercised enough.
- Yes, Chief.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.599
You are fine as you are.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.435
Yes, it feels great.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.020
Come on, make yourself useful.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.898
Is he crazy or what?

30:59.441 --> 31:01.068
Ah, this feels great.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.320
Hold it.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.662
- You know...
- Seriously?!

31:12.954 --> 31:14.789
Don't talk to me!

31:14.790 --> 31:16.792
You're messing up my breathing!

31:17.918 --> 31:19.378
Let's start with cardio.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.588
Chief.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.924
Do you know Cho Tae-Oh
from Sin Jin Trading?

31:24.925 --> 31:25.967
Cho Tae-Oh?

31:26.259 --> 31:28.136
Second or third kid of Sin Jin Group?

31:28.428 --> 31:29.888
Heard he's a real fuck up.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.809
Getting into trouble after
coming back from studying abroad.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.185
Says who?

31:35.811 --> 31:36.812
Reporters.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.857
Notorious in the business circle.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.152
I drank with him last night.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.992
Don't get up right away.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.869
They'll stare at you.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.913
Stay down.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.082
Do some stretching.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.167
It hurts.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.461
The pain won't last, but shame will.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.587
You alright, sir?

32:03.588 --> 32:04.672
What? Why?

32:04.673 --> 32:07.926
You're bleeding in the back.

32:08.468 --> 32:12.097
I don't think you should go
into the sauna with that bruise.

32:12.389 --> 32:16.143
Soaking is good for bruises.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.270
Little weaklings.

32:18.854 --> 32:22.440
That Cho Tae-Oh from Sin Jin Trading

32:22.441 --> 32:24.067
smells like trouble.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.737
You got a chance to sniff
someone like him?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.197
I wish I could have a sniff.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.117
The actress from the detective drama...

32:33.118 --> 32:35.787
Her manager, Yun. You know him?

32:36.746 --> 32:40.292
He invited me to an after party.

32:40.459 --> 32:45.422
I could feel that this
bastard was up to no good.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.424
For the first time in my 20-year career,

32:48.425 --> 32:50.342
I shook hands with
the commissioner yesterday.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.385
His hands felt warm.

32:51.386 --> 32:56.386
Let's keep it real quiet
until our case is closed.

32:57.934 --> 32:58.977
Agreed?

32:59.769 --> 33:02.938
He was sniffling like a coke addict.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.315
Sinus problems.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.151
A grown up rich boy
with sinus problems?!

33:07.152 --> 33:08.694
Give me a break!

33:08.695 --> 33:11.490
Did you pick up the check last night?!
What's your problem?!

33:11.781 --> 33:15.326
Think you can get a warrant
for a sniffling nose?!

33:15.327 --> 33:16.368
Then be my guest!

33:16.369 --> 33:18.079
If not, finish your damn report!

33:18.330 --> 33:20.956
Hae Woo Constructions won
a 3 billion dollar contract

33:20.957 --> 33:23.418
to build a thermoelectric power station.

33:23.710 --> 33:28.882
KE won a 1.6 billion dollar
nuclear plant contract...

33:30.634 --> 33:33.220
I selected only the articles
that pertain to the group.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.595
Do you want to continue later?

33:34.596 --> 33:36.306
That's the least of my concerns.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.558
What's with the emergency
executive meeting?

33:39.059 --> 33:41.894
<i>The Group's executive
meeting is in progress</i>

33:41.895 --> 33:43.980
<i>in the main conference room.</i>

33:44.272 --> 33:48.859
<i>Non-executives, please refrain
from using the elevators.</i>

33:48.860 --> 33:51.279
I think the Chairman wants
to finalize reorganization

33:51.571 --> 33:54.533
before he is called in for
questioning by the DA.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.536
Will we get the telecom business?

33:58.119 --> 33:59.621
Don't let it show on your face.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.331
The meeting's gonna be a long one.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.252
Try not to drink water if you can.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.298
I'm supposed to put this on?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.677
Everyone wears it for
the executive meeting.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.055
You can't leave while
the Chairman is talking.

34:24.437 --> 34:28.232
CHO TAE-OH

34:28.233 --> 34:29.985
CHO JI-SU
CHO TAE-JIN

34:30.610 --> 34:32.779
<i>Announcement for
the main conference room.</i>

34:33.113 --> 34:37.909
<i>Due to the Chairman's appointment
with the prosecutors' office,</i>

34:38.410 --> 34:41.162
<i>today's meeting has been canceled.</i>

34:41.788 --> 34:46.584
<i>To ensure emergency preparedness</i>

34:46.585 --> 34:48.962
<i>please maintain the state of emergency.</i>

34:50.171 --> 34:51.256
<i>Once again.</i>

34:52.299 --> 34:57.345
<i>Due to an appointment with
the prosecutors' office...</i>

34:58.722 --> 35:03.722
He can't be doing this
after calling everyone up.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.729
HOSPITALIZED CHAIRMAN
CHO DONG-GUN APPEARS IN COURT

35:09.649 --> 35:13.027
If dad gets locked up,
the telecom will go to my sister.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.278
We'll see.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.573
But it requires a shareholders' meeting
and other complicated procedures.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.241
The investigation will take time, too.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.827
Shareholders' meeting, my ass!

35:21.870 --> 35:25.664
One of us will get the telecom business.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.916
But we don't have any intel.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.461
Why is our intel so shitty?

35:29.919 --> 35:33.422
But aunt is distressed about...

35:33.423 --> 35:34.423
<i>HEY-</i>

35:34.424 --> 35:35.341
Yeah?

35:35.342 --> 35:36.676
Isn't it business hours?

35:37.927 --> 35:38.928
Of course.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.765
Mrs. Cho is a bit sensitive
because of the Chairman.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.726
MODEL CHICK

35:56.029 --> 35:57.821
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

35:57.822 --> 36:01.117
Can't I know what's going on
with the company, Mr. Choi?

36:03.078 --> 36:04.371
It's not that.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.207
It's a subcontractor complaining
about not getting paid.

36:08.208 --> 36:12.002
Legally, we're in the clear.
So, we're trying to avoid

36:12.003 --> 36:13.838
getting the police involved.

36:14.381 --> 36:17.008
Don't make things complicated.
Send him up to my office.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.218
Sorry?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.928
We can't afford to ruin
our corporate image.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.306
Let's take care of this quietly.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.980
You have a good-looking boy.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.902
Can't be using such rough
words in front of him.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.696
Did you have lunch?

36:38.279 --> 36:40.948
I'm sorry I didn't mean to...

36:40.949 --> 36:42.701
Then what?

36:43.118 --> 36:46.036
You can't terminate the contract
for joining the union.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.831
We didn't.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.125
You don't have a contract with us.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.876
What about the back wages?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.712
Don't raise your voice.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.552
We make next to nothing
from delivering containers.

37:00.969 --> 37:04.556
Because of the high gas price,
we drive at 80 km/h for 7 hours.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.307
We even skip meals to save costs.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.395
But the contractor says he didn't
get anything from the headquarters.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.356
It's a difficult time for everyone.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.900
Every year, they say
this flu is the worst one ever

37:16.901 --> 37:19.946
and the economy is
the worst one ever.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.781
Did that kill me?

37:23.158 --> 37:25.368
I'm not dead.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.247
Hey!

37:29.998 --> 37:31.666
You want that, don't you?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.672
So, how much do they owe you?

37:38.339 --> 37:39.840
To start from the beginning...

37:39.841 --> 37:41.467
Please sit down.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.136
Just the total.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.637
Here.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.638
Say thank you.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.766
Thank you.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.356
It's quite a lot. It's 4.2.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.817
4.2 million dollars?

37:58.777 --> 37:59.736
No.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.821
4 grand?

38:03.740 --> 38:05.408
Oh, my...

38:07.660 --> 38:08.995
Driver... Sir.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.540
You know the grindstone?

38:13.500 --> 38:16.169
There's a handle on the grindstone.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.715
You try to grind something
and the handle falls out.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.926
Just like that.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.969
It's quite dumbfounding.

38:25.970 --> 38:30.058
You can't do the work
just because of the stupid handle.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.020
That's how I feel.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.982
I'm at a loss.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.570
He's the contractor.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.280
President, Sir! I'm so sorry.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.908
That's a dangerous comment.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.036
Why call me President?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.121
I apologize, Director Cho.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.166
I told you I'll pay you this week.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.167
When?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.419
Mr. Jeon.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.049
Did you steal from the drivers?

39:03.258 --> 39:05.218
No, sir. Never!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.971
Put the gloves on. Both of you.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.735
Stop recording

39:32.203 --> 39:34.706
Let's settle this like men.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.209
It's alright.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.879
Instead of trying to extort from me,

39:41.212 --> 39:42.881
earn it with your sweat.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.341
What do you think you're doing?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.467
Come on. You're scaring your boy.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.178
It's okay.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.847
This is how
the grown-ups earn a living.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.641
Watch how hard it is to make money.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.769
You'll grow up to be
a good son, right?

39:58.479 --> 39:59.230
Ready?

39:59.522 --> 40:00.231
Yes, sir.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.618
Fight!

40:15.038 --> 40:17.039
Don't just stand around!

40:17.040 --> 40:20.126
Come on! Like real men!

40:20.460 --> 40:21.377
Mr. Jeon.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.297
You'll get a registered complaint
if you don't do this right.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.966
What do you think you're
doing in front of a kid?!

40:28.092 --> 40:29.302
3 points for Mr. Jeon!

40:29.969 --> 40:33.138
You won't get any money
just by getting hit.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.516
You came to get paid.
Put on the gloves!

40:39.187 --> 40:41.856
Look how tough it is to make a buck.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.399
Let's cheer for Daddy.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.026
Go, Daddy!

40:46.444 --> 40:47.736
Let's send the kid outside.

40:47.737 --> 40:48.988
Focus!

41:11.803 --> 41:12.594
Mr. Choi.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.428
Yes?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.305
Mr. Bae might injure his teeth.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.891
Give him some tissue to bite into.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.406
Protect your teeth.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.750
Why did you make
a big deal out of it, idiot?!

41:58.057 --> 42:01.728
Look at yourself.
And for pocket change?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.147
Dear me...

42:04.689 --> 42:05.690
Mr. driver.

42:06.649 --> 42:11.362
I put some on top of
the 4,200 you're owed.

42:12.613 --> 42:16.367
Buy some cookies for your son

42:17.910 --> 42:19.871
and some bandages for yourself.

42:23.207 --> 42:28.588
This puts an end
to the matter. Agreed?

42:30.089 --> 42:31.382
Cheer up.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.218
Eight times seven is fifty-six.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.512
Eight times eight is sixty-three.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.266
Eight times nine is seventy.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.268
Nine times one is nine.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.188
Nine times two is eighteen.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.982
Nine times three is twenty-seven.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.777
Nine times four is thirty-six.

42:53.488 --> 42:57.365
Nine times five is forty-three.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.534
Nine times six is eighty-three.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.746
Nine times seven is sixty-three.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.415
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.627
Nine times nine is eighty-one.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.677
PAY THE DELIVERY FEES!
TAKE BACK YOUR POLICY!

43:29.690 --> 43:30.440
DA-HYE

43:30.441 --> 43:32.359
Why can't we get someone
like that on the force?

43:32.360 --> 43:35.238
I was the inspiration for the writer.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.156
Inspiration, my ass!

43:37.532 --> 43:39.324
My sister's kid is driving me nuts.

43:39.325 --> 43:43.162
He's obsessed with the idea
of becoming an actor.

43:43.496 --> 43:44.746
- Hey, Do-Cheol!
- Yeah?

43:44.747 --> 43:47.165
You can introduce him
to that talent agency, right?

43:47.166 --> 43:48.500
Guy or a girl?

43:48.501 --> 43:50.962
A guy and he's great looking.

43:51.254 --> 43:53.004
And tall... about 185 centimeters.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.006
I don't like guys that are too tall.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.300
Why don't you just eat?

43:56.509 --> 43:59.178
Why are you talking to
Miss Bong that way?

43:59.387 --> 44:01.179
Tell him to learn a trade.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.557
Just about any loser wants to
be an actor these days.

44:03.558 --> 44:04.559
What? Any loser?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.107
Put some food on my plate.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.655
This is Detective Seo from Seoul District.

44:20.867 --> 44:22.076
Who?

44:23.536 --> 44:27.165
Calm down and talk to me.

44:41.888 --> 44:43.806
I came quickly, didn't I?

44:45.558 --> 44:47.268
What happened?

44:48.144 --> 44:52.607
He fell from the stairs.

44:52.982 --> 44:57.861
I found your card in his wallet.

44:57.862 --> 45:01.240
You did the right thing.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.782
Did you eat?

45:02.783 --> 45:04.035
Who are you?

45:04.493 --> 45:08.080
I used to work with Mr. Bae.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.291
I'm a cop.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.127
The police are already here.

45:14.587 --> 45:15.754
You're an officer?

45:15.755 --> 45:17.131
Yes, I'm with the...

45:17.548 --> 45:19.174
Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation.

45:19.175 --> 45:22.177
He was protesting at
the headquarters for back payment

45:22.178 --> 45:24.847
and jumped off the fire escape.

45:25.139 --> 45:30.139
Luckily, he was caught over
the handrail and survived,

45:30.686 --> 45:32.145
but he is in a coma.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.440
Will the company take
responsibility for this?

45:35.441 --> 45:37.234
Since the whole thing was
about a back payment.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.819
That's the victim's side of the story,

45:39.820 --> 45:42.489
but according to
the company's legal team,

45:42.490 --> 45:46.326
he isn't contracted with the company.

45:46.327 --> 45:49.287
He's with a subcontractor.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.498
But even that contract is terminated.

45:51.499 --> 45:56.629
What's more, the subcontractor
paid the driver today.

45:56.921 --> 46:00.173
But since the driver is unconscious,

46:00.174 --> 46:02.176
we don't know why he jumped.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.845
And with a young child...

46:05.846 --> 46:07.306
I don't know what to do.

46:09.809 --> 46:13.812
A tough guy has to
eat well and get strong

46:13.813 --> 46:17.024
and fight situations like this.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.987
Doctors will fix Daddy up in no time.

46:21.696 --> 46:23.571
I heard you were with him today.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.116
Didn't you go to school?

46:25.658 --> 46:27.784
We have the clay off.
It's the school's anniversary.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.621
Playing hooky. Nice.

46:31.539 --> 46:34.667
But you came home separately?

46:34.959 --> 46:40.047
He put me in a cab.

46:42.049 --> 46:45.928
You can ride in a cab by yourself?
How impressive!

46:46.512 --> 46:51.142
Dad couldn't ride in the cab
because of me.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.311
But he did nothing wrong.

46:53.561 --> 46:56.771
Of course. Who said your
father did anything wrong?

46:56.772 --> 46:58.524
He did nothing wrong.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.777
Then, why did he get beat up?

47:05.698 --> 47:06.699
Beat up?

47:07.783 --> 47:09.242
Your father got beat up?

47:09.243 --> 47:10.368
He was assaulted?

47:10.369 --> 47:13.289
Yes, the boy witnessed it at the scene.

47:13.581 --> 47:17.751
With the family in shock, I thought
you might not have gotten the whole story.

47:17.752 --> 47:21.547
I understand. I'll talk
to the boy right away.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.340
Have this in the meantime.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.842
Thank you.

47:25.801 --> 47:28.429
The boy couldn't stop crying before.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.182
You can see from the statements...

47:31.432 --> 47:37.188
Did you check the CCTV and confirm?

47:37.521 --> 47:41.567
We checked, but at that time
there was a system checkup.

47:42.109 --> 47:42.942
A system checkup?

47:42.943 --> 47:47.907
Unfortunately, it coincided exactly
with the time of the incident.

47:48.199 --> 47:53.078
But there is no legal obligation
to keep CCTV in private buildings.

47:53.079 --> 47:54.287
What about the check?

47:54.288 --> 47:57.375
Who gave the check
and where was it issued?

47:57.666 --> 48:00.127
I can't stand this anymore.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.588
Don't you think you're
crossing the line?

48:02.838 --> 48:05.674
If you keep this up, we'll
file a formal complaint.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.177
Do you think we're idiots?

48:08.469 --> 48:11.805
I'm just trying to help since
there's been a development.

48:11.806 --> 48:14.475
Who's helping who?

48:14.892 --> 48:18.186
We're busy as hell here

48:18.187 --> 48:20.438
and you're bothering us
with improper solicitation.

48:20.439 --> 48:21.856
What did you say?

48:21.857 --> 48:23.108
Solicitation?

48:23.109 --> 48:25.235
I'm cooperating in an investigation!

48:25.236 --> 48:27.028
What the heck? What's your rank?

48:27.029 --> 48:28.238
You're with
the Metropolitan Bureau?

48:28.239 --> 48:29.155
Let's get outta here!

48:29.156 --> 48:32.118
Why don't you take the damn case?!

48:32.410 --> 48:35.078
Just because they couldn't
stop a man from jumping,

48:35.079 --> 48:38.039
What the fuck? you can't charge them
for aiding and abetting suicide!

48:38.040 --> 48:38.873
Get your hands off!

48:38.874 --> 48:40.418
What are we supposed to do?!

49:13.367 --> 49:14.660
He's from the Met Bureau?

49:15.119 --> 49:17.287
This isn't even within their jurisdiction!

49:17.288 --> 49:19.330
He says he's friends with Director Cho.

49:19.331 --> 49:22.417
Why is this loser cop
talking nonsense?

49:22.418 --> 49:23.751
- Legal Team?
- Yes.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.044
When are we getting
the case review?

49:25.045 --> 49:28.131
We've got to be ready to file
a complaint for interference, okay?

49:28.132 --> 49:29.007
Understood.

49:29.008 --> 49:32.887
You guys must think I'm playing here.

49:33.179 --> 49:34.471
I'm Choi Dea-Woong, SVP.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.600
You're here to see the Director of
Strategy? For what reason?

49:38.893 --> 49:40.686
You're a senior vice president!

49:41.020 --> 49:43.439
Does that mean you outrank Tae-Oh?

49:43.772 --> 49:48.777
I heard there was an unfortunate
incident at Tae-Oh's company.

49:49.069 --> 49:52.238
So, I stopped by to see
if I can offer help.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.156
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
SEO DO-CHEOL

49:53.157 --> 49:55.658
There was an unfortunate incident.

49:55.659 --> 49:59.162
But it is being taken care of
according to the law.

49:59.163 --> 50:03.417
Don't be like that. That's not right.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.169
Is Tae-Oh very busy?

50:06.170 --> 50:09.256
Let's not put each other
in uncomfortable positions.

50:09.798 --> 50:13.135
If you're getting any funny
ideas about this incident,

50:13.427 --> 50:14.636
there is nothing of the sort.

50:14.637 --> 50:17.139
What funny idea might that be?

50:17.431 --> 50:19.057
Did somebody get beat up?

50:19.058 --> 50:22.811
<i>The Director of Strategy
is using elevator 3.</i>

50:24.688 --> 50:26.272
I've got your contact details.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.857
Hey! Tae-Oh!

50:27.858 --> 50:29.609
Tae-Oh! It's me, Do-Cheol!

50:29.610 --> 50:31.487
Hey! Stop him!

50:31.779 --> 50:33.071
Get him out!

50:33.072 --> 50:34.572
Grab him!

50:34.573 --> 50:35.573
Hey, Tae-Oh!

50:35.574 --> 50:37.325
My leg!

50:37.326 --> 50:39.702
Shit! My leg!

50:39.703 --> 50:41.120
- Tae-Oh! My man!
- Shit!

50:41.121 --> 50:45.084
Bastards! Let go of me!

50:50.005 --> 50:52.216
Do your job right, or else!

50:53.509 --> 50:56.052
Call our police network
and get this guy's details.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.471
Right away, sir.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.235
Loosen up.

51:11.652 --> 51:12.695
LOW!

51:21.036 --> 51:21.745
<i>HEY-</i>

51:26.208 --> 51:27.167
<i>HEY-</i>

51:28.127 --> 51:29.670
Are you playing with me?

51:30.838 --> 51:32.756
Do you think I pay you for this?

51:49.523 --> 51:51.609
Keep your body low.

51:51.942 --> 51:52.818
Grapple!

51:58.949 --> 51:59.867
That's too tight.

52:03.412 --> 52:04.204
Don't squeeze.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.332
Let go!

52:08.500 --> 52:10.377
Too strong!

52:10.628 --> 52:12.338
Tae-Gu! Release!

52:12.713 --> 52:13.964
Release, you bastard!

52:15.007 --> 52:15.966
Hey!

52:16.258 --> 52:17.885
I said release!

52:18.927 --> 52:21.388
Fuck!

52:22.723 --> 52:24.099
Are you okay?

52:25.809 --> 52:27.811
I'm alright.

52:28.103 --> 52:29.688
This makes it fun.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.964
Wait... stop!

52:56.965 --> 52:57.966
Stop!

53:06.725 --> 53:10.187
Think you got what it takes
to be my bodyguard?

53:12.022 --> 53:13.774
Find something more suitable.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.444
Sorry to keep you waiting.

53:18.237 --> 53:19.488
I'm ready now.

53:19.697 --> 53:24.697
WOMEN WANT PREMIUM

53:25.703 --> 53:29.331
CITY-LIKE LIVING SPACES

53:37.673 --> 53:40.676
I don't feel like wanting to
live in that apartment.

53:41.176 --> 53:43.386
Since we're pressed for time...

53:43.387 --> 53:46.056
We'll revise it for the next media cycle.

53:49.768 --> 53:51.228
Attack. Attack!

53:54.148 --> 53:55.023
Down.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.734
I was just playing-

53:58.402 --> 54:01.447
Let's change to a fresh face.

54:02.156 --> 54:04.323
You know that TV show
"Wicked Beauties"?

54:04.324 --> 54:06.410
I like the girl in that show.

54:06.785 --> 54:08.871
She has the same agency as Da-Hye.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.999
What was the fuss about?

54:12.708 --> 54:15.960
Do you know a cop
called Seo Do-Cheol?

54:15.961 --> 54:18.881
He said he knows you personally.

54:19.131 --> 54:19.964
A cop?

54:19.965 --> 54:20.715
Yeah.

54:20.716 --> 54:21.759
Who could it be?

54:22.968 --> 54:24.720
Not here for the investigation?

54:24.928 --> 54:29.558
He said he's
personally close to you

54:29.808 --> 54:31.851
and wanted to help.

54:31.852 --> 54:34.188
Idiot... Who's helping who?

54:34.730 --> 54:37.690
I think he's after a kickback
thinking it's a corporate case.

54:37.691 --> 54:39.901
Poking around for a slice of the pie.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.028
Don't worry about it.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.780
I got this.

54:42.988 --> 54:47.534
This country treats
businessmen like criminals.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.245
Isn't it run by the taxes we pay?

54:51.997 --> 54:53.081
What about the hospital?

54:55.709 --> 54:56.418
<i>HEY-</i>

55:01.965 --> 55:04.301
As for the injury
sustained in the office,

55:04.760 --> 55:07.178
I made sure no medical
records were made.

55:07.179 --> 55:11.266
More natural to make it
an injury from the fall.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.435
And according to the doctor,

55:14.520 --> 55:17.564
it's unlikely that he'll wake up.

55:17.856 --> 55:21.859
We'll settle with the family and
get the legal team's full analysis.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.154
It'll all be quiet by
tomorrow morning.

55:27.533 --> 55:30.410
Let's work smart.

55:31.537 --> 55:34.081
It won't be a problem

55:34.373 --> 55:37.417
unless someone makes it
into a problem.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.427
I'll be back in a little bit.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.388
I already put in my
hours for the month.

55:50.389 --> 55:55.101
<i>What have you been up to
that I should get a call from upstairs?</i>

55:55.102 --> 55:56.894
<i>Are you stirring up trouble
in the other district?!</i>

55:56.895 --> 55:58.729
Stop breathing down my neck!

55:58.730 --> 56:00.147
I'll explain later at the office.

56:00.148 --> 56:01.608
I'm busy. I gotta go.

56:05.737 --> 56:08.574
Hey! What are you doing?

56:09.533 --> 56:11.368
- You can't be in here.
- What's going on?

56:13.203 --> 56:14.580
Detective.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.747
Let's not step on each other's toes.

56:16.748 --> 56:17.623
Take him out.

56:17.624 --> 56:19.209
What the heck?

56:19.501 --> 56:20.376
Hey!

56:20.377 --> 56:21.377
You're in a hospital...

56:21.378 --> 56:22.588
Please keep it down!

56:22.838 --> 56:24.297
- Go outside! Now!
- Alright. Fine.

56:24.298 --> 56:26.841
Did they offer money?
Did you accept?

56:26.842 --> 56:28.301
Did they make you sign anything?

56:28.302 --> 56:29.594
No... I just...

56:29.595 --> 56:31.095
Let's talk outside.

56:31.096 --> 56:33.765
Don't touch me! I'm talking!

56:37.436 --> 56:39.146
Mr. Choi!

56:39.479 --> 56:40.856
Let go, man!

56:41.899 --> 56:43.191
Jeez...

56:43.525 --> 56:49.907
The company is giving condolence money
for the sake of the corporate image.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.450
A lawyer should determine that.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.578
Why is a cop acting as a go-between?

56:54.828 --> 56:57.246
What's a lawyer got to do with this?

56:57.247 --> 56:58.664
It's a case of attempted suicide.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.667
A man threw himself off
a big corporation building.

57:01.668 --> 57:03.754
And not a single article is
published in the papers.

57:04.046 --> 57:08.299
The company is so quick
to try to settle the case.

57:08.300 --> 57:09.508
What settlement?

57:09.509 --> 57:10.718
It's condolence money.

57:10.719 --> 57:14.556
We gotta figure out why he jumped
before you settle or offer condolences!

57:15.849 --> 57:20.187
The victim over there,
he was assaulted in Cho's office.

57:20.395 --> 57:22.730
Why are you weaving tales
in someone else's district?!

57:22.731 --> 57:24.524
We checked the facts, too!

57:25.275 --> 57:29.528
Their legal team wanted to sue
for interference with business!

57:29.529 --> 57:31.114
Cho stopped that from happening!

57:32.491 --> 57:33.533
Did you take a bribe?

57:34.910 --> 57:36.870
You're crossing the line here.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.458
You little piece of shit.

57:41.959 --> 57:45.754
We may have no money,
but we have integrity.

57:47.005 --> 57:50.384
Don't go around smearing our name.

58:00.185 --> 58:01.770
Damn stairs...

58:04.690 --> 58:05.816
<i>I'm sorry, Dab)'-</i>

58:07.317 --> 58:11.446
<i>Life's hard because of
hunger and injustice.</i>

58:12.322 --> 58:16.326
<i>All I want is to live a dignified
life like a human being.</i>

58:17.202 --> 58:19.829
<i>But I get treated like a lowlife
because of a few bucks.</i>

58:19.830 --> 58:21.623
<i>I can't live like this anymore.</i>

58:22.416 --> 58:25.377
<i>To punish the powerful,</i>

58:26.211 --> 58:27.838
<i>this is the only way.</i>

58:29.840 --> 58:31.341
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

58:37.139 --> 58:41.059
I don't think that cop is after a payoff.

58:43.478 --> 58:44.479
So what?

58:44.688 --> 58:46.398
So I think we should...

58:50.110 --> 58:52.903
<i>speak to our corporate adviser, Jeong,</i>

58:52.904 --> 58:55.698
who retired as a police commissioner.

58:55.699 --> 59:02.748
I'll get him to funnel his influence down
the right channels to give the cop a push.

59:04.958 --> 59:11.506
Superintendent Kim is interested in
pursuing politics after his retirement.

59:12.007 --> 59:15.218
This soccer league is to secure
votes from the local district.

59:15.677 --> 59:17.387
Meetings like this can be awkward.

59:17.679 --> 59:20.265
But some face time
definitely has an effect.

59:23.310 --> 59:26.729
Please pick up your uniforms!

59:26.730 --> 59:28.523
Come this way!

59:29.691 --> 59:31.108
This is a nice field.

59:31.109 --> 59:33.611
What's a busy man like you doing here?

59:33.612 --> 59:34.612
I'm Cho Tae-Oh.

59:34.613 --> 59:37.031
I should've paid you a visit earlier.
I heard a lot about you.

59:37.032 --> 59:39.993
Thanks to you, I get to
see my old boss again

59:40.285 --> 59:44.371
and play in this nice field.

59:44.372 --> 59:46.415
Please use it as you please.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.460
- May I?
- Let's take a walk.

59:50.420 --> 59:54.341
You must be busy with issues
at your father's company.

59:54.633 --> 59:56.885
Must be a burden
to deal with other problems.

59:57.135 --> 59:58.844
I should have done better.

59:58.845 --> 1:00:00.847
I can only blame my inexperience.

1:00:01.181 --> 1:00:05.018
I reviewed the file, but
we've already closed the case.

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:08.479
There's a loose cannon
at the Metropolitan Bureau.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.023
Yes, I heard.

1:00:10.357 --> 1:00:14.652
Luckily, I'm a schoolmate and
close friends with his superintendent.

1:00:14.653 --> 1:00:16.695
We still go climbing together.

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:20.909
His daughter just graduated
from music school

1:00:21.201 --> 1:00:23.286
and wants to hold a recital.

1:00:23.912 --> 1:00:28.041
And my son will soon be
job hunting, too.

1:00:29.417 --> 1:00:30.877
Is he already graduating?

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:32.170
- Yes, sir.
- What was his major?

1:00:34.005 --> 1:00:34.922
<i>Seo,</i>

1:00:34.923 --> 1:00:37.174
why are you going around
and pissing on everyone?

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:39.218
You gonna keep smearing my name?

1:00:39.219 --> 1:00:40.469
SUPERINTENDENT KANG JUNG-SHIK

1:00:40.470 --> 1:00:42.263
I guess I spoiled you too much lately.

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:45.474
But the victim helped us
with the car smuggling case...

1:00:45.475 --> 1:00:46.768
Now you dare to interrupt?

1:00:49.062 --> 1:00:51.857
You accused them of taking a bribe?

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.110
You become a star and
now have no respect.

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:58.613
Are you the only cop in this town?

1:00:59.406 --> 1:01:01.867
You ungrateful bastard...

1:01:03.535 --> 1:01:07.247
If I hear anything
about this case again...

1:01:07.831 --> 1:01:10.833
Put him on the housewives
gambling crackdown

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:12.751
so that he doesn't run around
stirring up trouble.

1:01:12.752 --> 1:01:13.795
Yes, sir.

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:17.006
Why so down?

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:19.758
Come on. Cheer up.

1:01:19.759 --> 1:01:20.926
Look at me, huh?

1:01:20.927 --> 1:01:22.137
<i>300-? eon!</i>

1:01:22.637 --> 1:01:24.014
Oh, sorry.

1:01:24.306 --> 1:01:26.141
There's someone here to see you.

1:01:26.433 --> 1:01:27.517
To see me?

1:01:29.019 --> 1:01:36.067
We know Mr. Seo is upset
about his driver friend.

1:01:37.152 --> 1:01:39.069
But... how should I put it?

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:42.199
We think he is crossing the line

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:46.077
and that's not helping anybody.

1:01:47.579 --> 1:01:50.957
What my husband does
is not my business.

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:57.297
I understand things are
difficult with the loan and all.

1:01:57.589 --> 1:02:00.634
We can help with that.

1:02:01.343 --> 1:02:03.220
And as for your children,

1:02:03.929 --> 1:02:08.641
our education department can
provide support until they go to college.

1:02:08.642 --> 1:02:10.894
Please persuade your husband.

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:15.315
Emotions and the law should not mix.

1:02:16.608 --> 1:02:20.278
If your husband continues
to investigate us,

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:24.199
we can't provide support
for the driver's family.

1:02:24.616 --> 1:02:29.287
Let's consider how
we can help each other.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:34.501
You know what?

1:02:35.585 --> 1:02:37.170
I have the same bag at home.

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:40.006
Mine must be a knockoff.

1:02:41.299 --> 1:02:44.636
Anyway, this is a hard color
to match with clothes and shoes.

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:46.762
We can fix that.

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:49.808
You'd think this can pack a lot.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.850
But you can't really fit a lot in.

1:02:51.851 --> 1:02:52.519
Look.

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.982
You don't have to check that here.

1:02:57.983 --> 1:03:01.277
Then why are you giving it to me here?

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:03.280
Do you need a receipt from me?

1:03:05.198 --> 1:03:08.450
When we begged you
to sponsor our sports events,

1:03:08.451 --> 1:03:10.494
you pretended to be deaf.

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:13.748
This is enough to hold events
for a whole year.

1:03:14.082 --> 1:03:18.128
Isn't it exhausting? Buying
people with your money?

1:03:19.087 --> 1:03:20.547
You might regret this.

1:03:22.841 --> 1:03:23.675
Look here.

1:03:24.092 --> 1:03:27.177
My life's been a regret
since I married that loser.

1:03:27.178 --> 1:03:28.721
I've got nothing else to regret.

1:03:28.722 --> 1:03:30.098
So no need to worry about me.

1:03:30.265 --> 1:03:31.223
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
HOUSEWIVES GAMBLING CRIMINAL CASE REPORT

1:03:31.224 --> 1:03:31.974
Fuck.

1:03:31.975 --> 1:03:34.560
Housewives gambling gang?!

1:03:34.561 --> 1:03:36.729
I'm not doing that shit!

1:03:36.730 --> 1:03:38.230
An order is an order!

1:03:38.231 --> 1:03:39.858
You're a part of the system!

1:03:40.150 --> 1:03:41.484
Come here!

1:03:42.152 --> 1:03:43.570
Hey, Seo Do-Cheol!

1:03:44.529 --> 1:03:48.073
What did you say to me
when we got married?

1:03:48.074 --> 1:03:51.577
You couldn't guarantee a life of luxury
but you wouldn't let me live in shame.

1:03:51.578 --> 1:03:55.498
Then you have people come
to my work and embarrass me?

1:03:57.709 --> 1:03:58.585
Hey...

1:03:59.085 --> 1:04:01.504
What the hell are you
doing at my work?

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:06.426
You're telling the world we need
a loan even for our rent deposit?

1:04:07.427 --> 1:04:08.136
What?

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:11.514
People from Sin Jin Trading
paid me a visit

1:04:11.931 --> 1:04:16.060
and gave me a designer bag
packed with cash.

1:04:16.061 --> 1:04:18.812
Which bastards from Sin Jin?

1:04:18.813 --> 1:04:22.567
You're the cop! You figure that out!

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:26.362
We agreed not to interfere
with each other's work,

1:04:26.363 --> 1:04:28.156
but let me say one thing.

1:04:28.615 --> 1:04:30.408
Let's not live in shame.

1:04:34.496 --> 1:04:35.789
Hey!

1:04:41.336 --> 1:04:43.838
You know what really
made me ashamed?

1:04:45.632 --> 1:04:48.760
When they put that bag
full of cash in front of me...

1:04:50.095 --> 1:04:51.304
I wavered.

1:04:54.391 --> 1:04:56.434
I'm a human being and a woman, too.

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:58.353
Okay?

1:05:06.528 --> 1:05:08.695
India is a fascinating country.

1:05:08.696 --> 1:05:10.948
I was especially
impressed with the people

1:05:10.949 --> 1:05:12.325
and their philosophy.

1:05:12.492 --> 1:05:14.827
Met a few fabulous
people on the last trip.

1:05:14.828 --> 1:05:18.706
They even gave me some useful tips
on dealing with things in India.

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:20.333
Really? What'd they say?

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:23.378
If we can't do it today,
there's tomorrow.

1:05:24.838 --> 1:05:26.046
That is quite true.

1:05:26.047 --> 1:05:27.841
Do you have an appointment?

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:29.633
Stop him!

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:31.261
Even if you're a cop,

1:05:31.553 --> 1:05:34.430
this establishment is
for members only!

1:05:34.431 --> 1:05:35.556
Back off!

1:05:35.557 --> 1:05:36.516
Hey! Hey!

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:41.104
You're making a big mistake...

1:05:50.071 --> 1:05:52.449
Oh, it's you.

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:54.908
Cops don't abide by the law?

1:05:54.909 --> 1:05:57.161
Who are you to mention law?!

1:05:57.162 --> 1:05:58.996
I told you not to cause trouble.

1:05:58.997 --> 1:06:01.166
What heinous crime did you commit,

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:05.170
that you're splashing cash
at a cop's wife?

1:06:05.462 --> 1:06:09.090
You're being rude in front of
my foreign guests.

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:12.093
If they know that you're a cop,

1:06:12.385 --> 1:06:14.386
what impression would
they get of Korea?

1:06:14.387 --> 1:06:16.139
A fucked up one, you punk!

1:06:18.266 --> 1:06:21.060
Let go, you sons of bitches!

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:25.315
Why are you doing this to me?

1:06:25.607 --> 1:06:27.441
Will you be able to deal with
what's to come?

1:06:27.442 --> 1:06:28.860
Cho Tae-Oh...

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:31.945
The punishment for assault isn't bad.

1:06:31.946 --> 1:06:33.447
Apologize sincerely,

1:06:33.448 --> 1:06:35.950
compensate the family and end it.

1:06:36.784 --> 1:06:38.328
You little bastard...

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.247
Don't touch me!

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:56.554
Prosecutor Oh is handling this case?

1:06:57.597 --> 1:07:00.558
Don't embarrass me
in front of my juniors.

1:07:00.808 --> 1:07:05.771
The papers had the drafts
sent to the editor.

1:07:05.772 --> 1:07:08.149
But they stopped the story
from being published.

1:07:08.441 --> 1:07:11.485
Isn't it a simple wage protest?

1:07:11.486 --> 1:07:13.028
I'm telling you there's more.

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:13.988
Like what?

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:19.327
Give me the inside
scoop on Cho Tae-Oh.

1:07:19.619 --> 1:07:22.747
I'll give you an exclusive
on the Sin Jin suicide attempt.

1:07:23.081 --> 1:07:25.166
This is a big story.

1:07:25.458 --> 1:07:27.709
You're always trying to fish without bait.

1:07:27.710 --> 1:07:29.461
What am I supposed to bite?

1:07:29.462 --> 1:07:30.630
Son of a bitch...

1:07:32.090 --> 1:07:35.717
I think the driver was assaulted
before he jumped off.

1:07:35.718 --> 1:07:39.013
Cho Tae-Oh instigated it himself.

1:07:39.305 --> 1:07:40.305
I'm liking it.

1:07:40.306 --> 1:07:43.559
The victim's son was at the scene.

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:44.519
His underage son?

1:07:44.978 --> 1:07:49.023
The cops on the case
are trying to close it.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:52.110
Not much I can do
since I'm not on this case.

1:07:52.777 --> 1:07:53.736
Hey...

1:07:54.070 --> 1:07:56.030
If you do some media manipulation,

1:07:56.239 --> 1:07:58.616
maybe there's something I can do.

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:01.160
This is gonna be a sensation.

1:08:03.121 --> 1:08:04.914
Don't share it with anyone else!

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:16.301
Is this it?

1:08:16.968 --> 1:08:20.346
I'm asking you! Can't you hear?

1:08:24.559 --> 1:08:25.768
Anyone here?

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:27.437
Mr. Choi!

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.398
Did you eat?

1:08:31.482 --> 1:08:33.568
We'll cover the cost.

1:08:33.818 --> 1:08:37.864
Why don't you leave the country
until this quiets down?

1:08:38.990 --> 1:08:42.118
You are talking nonsense again.

1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:45.747
Why should I run when I'm the victim?

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.790
Can't you see that
I'm already in prison?

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.335
I know.

1:08:50.918 --> 1:08:53.880
We're not asking you
to leave with empty pockets.

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:58.384
I also have ears, Mr. Choi.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:09:01.596
I used to be a member of
the Mammoth gang.

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:07.435
It's all because of
that loose cannon cop.

1:09:08.561 --> 1:09:12.148
There are a lot of hungry
and eager kids here.

1:09:12.815 --> 1:09:15.818
Even before making
the boat trip to this country,

1:09:16.110 --> 1:09:18.695
they had no registration, no I.D.s.

1:09:18.696 --> 1:09:20.114
Safe for operations.

1:09:20.615 --> 1:09:21.491
Operations?

1:09:21.949 --> 1:09:26.371
Tying this up benefits us both.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.999
It'll just be a matter of time
before that cop finds me.

1:09:30.750 --> 1:09:35.750
Let's say some foreigner
mistakes him for me

1:09:36.464 --> 1:09:38.466
and accidentally kills him.

1:09:38.841 --> 1:09:41.010
What are they gonna do about it?

1:09:44.389 --> 1:09:45.890
Do you have a quotation?

1:09:46.099 --> 1:09:48.309
Five big ones, non-negotiable.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:51.979
I can get by in the Philippines
with that kind of money.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.780
You're early. Traffic wasn't bad?

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:02.656
Park the car!

1:10:02.657 --> 1:10:05.618
I had a chat with Jeon, the contractor.

1:10:08.121 --> 1:10:10.707
He made an interesting proposition.

1:10:11.082 --> 1:10:13.459
I thought you weren't
gonna call me again.

1:10:13.751 --> 1:10:15.628
Don't treat me like that.

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:18.840
I also didn't want to call.

1:10:23.261 --> 1:10:24.637
I...

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:29.058
You're pregnant?

1:10:29.809 --> 1:10:31.769
What, you wanna
marry me or something?

1:10:34.105 --> 1:10:37.567
Think before you cause trouble.

1:10:38.818 --> 1:10:41.487
Pull a trick like this again
and you're dead.

1:10:46.659 --> 1:10:48.286
<i>Door is closing.</i>

1:10:48.578 --> 1:10:49.787
Let them in.

1:10:50.037 --> 1:10:51.748
Please, get in.

1:10:52.081 --> 1:10:53.040
Get in.

1:11:00.339 --> 1:11:02.133
<i>Door is closing.</i>

1:11:05.845 --> 1:11:08.639
I got a call from Myeong Seong Daily.

1:11:09.140 --> 1:11:13.686
Had to run ads to stop the article.

1:11:14.687 --> 1:11:16.439
What trouble did he get himself into?

1:11:17.064 --> 1:11:18.191
What happened?

1:11:19.275 --> 1:11:20.485
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

1:11:21.319 --> 1:11:24.614
Are you just going to apologize
all the time like your father?

1:11:26.115 --> 1:11:27.450
What were you doing?

1:11:27.742 --> 1:11:31.454
Didn't we hire you to take care
of problems like this?

1:11:33.539 --> 1:11:34.999
What really happened?

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:38.211
Would you even believe me?

1:11:40.338 --> 1:11:41.130
Get down on the floor.

1:11:50.348 --> 1:11:51.474
Hands clasped?

1:11:51.766 --> 1:11:53.850
What kind of an aide have you been

1:11:53.851 --> 1:11:59.357
to let a subcontractor get beat up
in the office and attempt suicide?

1:11:59.649 --> 1:12:03.236
You let this happen when
the company is in trouble?!

1:12:04.195 --> 1:12:08.366
What were you doing
while this was going on?!

1:12:08.658 --> 1:12:09.617
I'm sorry, sir!

1:12:10.117 --> 1:12:13.996
I'll make sure this doesn't
cause further damage.

1:12:14.497 --> 1:12:15.289
Any leaks from inside?

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:18.209
Everyone at the scene is clean.

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:22.004
We checked their emails
and phone records.

1:12:22.296 --> 1:12:24.298
There were no records
of contacting the press.

1:12:24.590 --> 1:12:25.550
Then what?

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:28.803
The reporter was saying
his morning prayers

1:12:29.178 --> 1:12:30.763
and had an epiphany?!

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.851
How can you run a company
in such a mental state?!

1:12:35.852 --> 1:12:38.187
You have to watch your blood pressure.

1:12:41.065 --> 1:12:43.025
Activate the media agencies

1:12:43.651 --> 1:12:45.528
and stop it from leaking to the press.

1:12:47.321 --> 1:12:51.117
You tell my wife

1:12:51.617 --> 1:12:54.579
to arrange a dinner with
the head prosecutor's wife.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:58.749
Heard she goes nuts for paintings.

1:13:01.794 --> 1:13:02.879
And you...

1:13:03.588 --> 1:13:07.133
Send all employees involved
on international assignments.

1:13:07.425 --> 1:13:10.386
You leave the country, too.

1:13:11.095 --> 1:13:12.513
This is the last time.

1:13:13.055 --> 1:13:14.640
You mess up one more time,

1:13:15.224 --> 1:13:19.186
you won't get a dime
from the company.

1:13:45.087 --> 1:13:46.546
You shouldn't drive.

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:47.756
I'll get someone.

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:49.008
Is that important now?

1:13:52.011 --> 1:13:55.556
You know the operation
that the contractor mentioned,

1:13:56.974 --> 1:13:58.141
let's proceed with that.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:13:59.268
Director Cho...

1:14:02.730 --> 1:14:03.814
Tae-Oh,

1:14:04.190 --> 1:14:06.275
that's a very risky proposition.

1:14:06.901 --> 1:14:08.903
Are you treating me like a retard?

1:14:09.278 --> 1:14:11.280
Because I'm the kid of the second wife?

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:14.450
Why do you say that?
You know that's not it.

1:14:14.951 --> 1:14:17.410
There's just no need since
the Chairman is involved.

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:20.206
Then why won't this
simple problem go away?!

1:14:23.209 --> 1:14:26.461
To survive in this family,
we gotta get tough.

1:14:26.462 --> 1:14:28.798
That applies to both of us.

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:32.926
If we can't handle
a simple problem like this,

1:14:32.927 --> 1:14:36.597
what little we have will go
to my goddamn siblings.

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:45.147
I'm sorry but my editor won't budge. Sin Jin is putting on pressure. You
should back off before it gets dangerous. Reporter Park, Myeong Seong Daily.

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:49.276
I haven't been able to
reach him for days.

1:14:49.819 --> 1:14:52.654
I can't even go home because of him.

1:14:52.655 --> 1:14:54.740
Can I use your phone?
My battery's dead.

1:14:55.116 --> 1:14:57.158
There are other phones here.

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:59.077
Relax. I won't make
an international call.

1:14:59.078 --> 1:15:01.371
You're invading my privacy!

1:15:01.372 --> 1:15:02.790
Look what we have here.

1:15:03.082 --> 1:15:05.084
You got a call from Jeon
10 minutes ago.

1:15:05.418 --> 1:15:06.293
What?

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:11.381
We're the kind of people that go for
intestine soup after seeing a dead body.

1:15:11.382 --> 1:15:15.052
If I want, I can send
anybody to prison.

1:15:15.219 --> 1:15:17.470
There's a family that pissed me off.

1:15:17.471 --> 1:15:19.473
Now three generations
are living in the cells.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:21.391
I can make one call

1:15:21.392 --> 1:15:25.311
and get your call records
with the message logs.

1:15:25.312 --> 1:15:28.816
You want me to print out
all your emails, too?

1:15:29.358 --> 1:15:33.070
Where did you learn
to lie to a police officer?

1:15:35.489 --> 1:15:36.782
Where's Jeon?

1:15:38.451 --> 1:15:40.453
Internal Affairs

1:15:43.330 --> 1:15:44.498
What now?

1:15:44.999 --> 1:15:48.126
Something urgent came up.
I can't stop by the store.

1:15:48.127 --> 1:15:50.546
What? You want a snack?

1:15:50.838 --> 1:15:51.713
Chicken?

1:15:51.714 --> 1:15:55.259
I should get my car looked at.

1:15:55.551 --> 1:15:57.344
Shut up and listen.

1:15:57.762 --> 1:16:02.140
I don't know what you've been up to
but Internal Affairs is here to see you.

1:16:02.141 --> 1:16:03.224
Internal Affairs?

1:16:03.225 --> 1:16:04.435
What the hell?

1:16:04.602 --> 1:16:06.770
Don't come in today.

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:07.896
Chief?

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:09.564
<i>What do you mean don't come in?</i>

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:10.524
<i>Hello?</i>

1:16:10.816 --> 1:16:12.693
<i>Hello? What the...?</i>

1:16:13.277 --> 1:16:14.278
Detective Seo...

1:16:14.737 --> 1:16:18.240
<i>Don't make it hard for your
colleagues. Come in ASAP.</i>

1:16:25.748 --> 1:16:29.584
<i>I was on my knees
and had my hands up</i>

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.628
<i>but he started kicking mercilessly.</i>

1:16:31.629 --> 1:16:35.007
<i>Didn't even tell us that he was a cop.</i>

1:16:42.014 --> 1:16:43.098
<i>I scraped my knees.</i>

1:16:43.099 --> 1:16:47.394
<i>He's showing signs of a concussion
due to blunt force trauma.</i>

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:50.230
<i>You know the metal pipe?</i>

1:16:50.231 --> 1:16:53.943
<i>He kicked it, and I got hit right here.</i>

1:16:54.151 --> 1:16:56.779
<i>And he started beating me up.</i>

1:16:58.239 --> 1:17:01.617
<i>I fell in and out of consciousness
but I still remember...</i>

1:17:01.867 --> 1:17:03.326
<i>What Miranda?</i>

1:17:03.327 --> 1:17:05.204
<i>When I came around,</i>

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:07.372
<i>I found myself locked up
in the police station.</i>

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:08.915
<i>I was just doing my job</i>

1:17:08.916 --> 1:17:10.792
<i>when my boss was attacked.</i>

1:17:10.793 --> 1:17:14.087
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

1:17:14.088 --> 1:17:15.714
It's a bit urgent.

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:19.969
There's a guy named
Seo Do-Cheol on my team.

1:17:20.261 --> 1:17:22.720
The one that busted up
the mob with us.

1:17:22.721 --> 1:17:24.098
That's the one!

1:17:24.431 --> 1:17:25.683
But...

1:17:26.142 --> 1:17:29.186
Internal Affairs is here
about an investigation.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.522
Can you find out what
the investigation is for?

1:17:32.523 --> 1:17:35.526
Officers get bad names
because of people like you.

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:37.695
The Police Department's
image is tarnished.

1:17:38.195 --> 1:17:39.947
Control your emotions.

1:17:40.406 --> 1:17:41.240
Detective Seo,

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:44.785
we understand that your wife
met an executive from Sin Jin.

1:17:45.161 --> 1:17:50.207
Someone saw Mr. Choi giving
a designer bag to your wife.

1:17:50.457 --> 1:17:54.837
You've been digging around
Sin Jin without authorization.

1:17:55.379 --> 1:17:58.174
And you threatened Cho today. Correct?

1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:01.677
Let's not get involved
with Sin Jin anymore.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:07.098
If you keep it up, even the commissioner
will start feeling the heat.

1:18:07.099 --> 1:18:09.810
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1:18:10.811 --> 1:18:13.772
If you're one of us, don't
stab your own in the back.

1:18:13.939 --> 1:18:16.233
Should we check for
dust on your team?

1:18:16.525 --> 1:18:17.818
Sorry for interrupting.

1:18:18.068 --> 1:18:20.112
Who did you say approved
the investigation?!

1:18:21.238 --> 1:18:22.489
Can't you see we're talking?

1:18:22.781 --> 1:18:25.743
I called your team and
they didn't know you were here.

1:18:26.076 --> 1:18:28.745
Don't you know we report
directly to the commissioner?

1:18:28.746 --> 1:18:30.205
Have you talked to the commissioner?

1:18:30.206 --> 1:18:33.417
Fine! I'll put you through to my boss.

1:18:33.584 --> 1:18:34.918
Take him if you're confident.

1:18:34.919 --> 1:18:38.547
There's no need.
We got all the information.

1:18:39.256 --> 1:18:40.257
Let's go.

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:42.968
Next time the whole team
will be out in the cold.

1:18:43.969 --> 1:18:46.430
For Christ's sake!

1:18:46.764 --> 1:18:47.556
Easy!

1:18:48.515 --> 1:18:50.308
You know how it works. Rank is king.

1:18:50.309 --> 1:18:51.226
Everything alright?

1:18:51.227 --> 1:18:52.477
Does this look okay to you?!

1:18:52.478 --> 1:18:54.479
I'm just doing my jab!

1:18:54.480 --> 1:18:55.898
What is the matter?

1:18:56.190 --> 1:18:58.524
Someone called saying
she couldn't reach you.

1:18:58.525 --> 1:19:00.778
The female employee
of the logistics company.

1:19:01.195 --> 1:19:03.864
Don't tell him I contacted you.

1:19:04.448 --> 1:19:06.699
Mr. Jeon is going out of the country.

1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:09.119
He asked me to wire some money.

1:19:09.912 --> 1:19:11.747
You sure I'm not gonna
get in trouble for this?

1:19:12.206 --> 1:19:14.999
Of course. Don't worry.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.628
Text me Jean's location.

1:19:19.129 --> 1:19:21.130
Hey, Seo! Get your ass over here!

1:19:21.131 --> 1:19:22.173
What? Why?

1:19:22.174 --> 1:19:24.092
Why are you interfering with my life?!

1:19:24.093 --> 1:19:26.053
You don't want me
to get a promotion, do you?!

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:32.267
I feel bad that he had to
attempt suicide

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:34.478
and I understand why
you're raving mad.

1:19:35.437 --> 1:19:39.733
But no police officer has ever
touched one of the super rich.

1:19:40.025 --> 1:19:42.026
Perhaps the prosecutors,
but us, no way.

1:19:42.027 --> 1:19:43.611
- Listen.
- Not in our lifetime!

1:19:43.612 --> 1:19:45.613
- Come on, man!
- It's out of the question!

1:19:45.614 --> 1:19:46.615
Brother!

1:19:46.907 --> 1:19:48.075
What's become of you?

1:19:48.367 --> 1:19:51.160
Don't be scared, you old man!
You won't die!

1:19:51.161 --> 1:19:54.831
You said, judges kill with decisions
and cops kill with reports!

1:19:54.832 --> 1:19:56.291
I'll make sure to kill with a report!

1:19:56.292 --> 1:19:58.836
Who's going to approve that report?!

1:20:05.009 --> 1:20:08.846
We both gotta work
until our kids go to college.

1:20:09.138 --> 1:20:12.266
You've done enough.

1:20:12.558 --> 1:20:15.436
Let's get back inside.

1:20:16.729 --> 1:20:19.188
You should move up
all the way to superintendent.

1:20:19.189 --> 1:20:21.817
But fuck it, since I'll
never make it that high.

1:20:22.109 --> 1:20:24.320
This isn't even your case!

1:20:24.611 --> 1:20:27.488
My friend from West District
went after a big gun.

1:20:27.489 --> 1:20:30.575
He got kicked to the curb
and got divorced,

1:20:30.576 --> 1:20:33.619
and is now living in a rented room
firing charcoal for barbecue.

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:34.538
Get out!

1:20:37.374 --> 1:20:38.876
Go, you bastard!

1:20:52.514 --> 1:20:53.265
MOTEL

1:21:11.909 --> 1:21:13.577
Holy shit!

1:21:18.165 --> 1:21:20.793
As teammates, even our
farts should smell the same.

1:21:23.087 --> 1:21:24.546
Superintendent Oh!

1:21:24.755 --> 1:21:26.130
Why are you here, newbie?

1:21:26.131 --> 1:21:29.008
Chief asked me to drop him off.

1:21:29.009 --> 1:21:30.343
I even had a date waiting.

1:21:30.344 --> 1:21:32.387
Don't you live on the opposite side?

1:21:32.388 --> 1:21:33.597
WaY Opposite.

1:21:52.449 --> 1:21:53.699
Rock, paper, scissors!

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:54.450
Shit...

1:21:54.451 --> 1:21:55.576
Rock, paper, scissors!

1:21:55.577 --> 1:21:56.537
Damn...

1:21:59.498 --> 1:22:00.666
Excuse me.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:03.419
Can you move your car?

1:22:03.669 --> 1:22:06.546
You can't park at the designated spot.

1:22:06.547 --> 1:22:07.297
You piece of shit!

1:22:07.464 --> 1:22:08.381
Grab him!

1:22:08.382 --> 1:22:09.340
Let go!

1:22:09.341 --> 1:22:10.384
Open the door!

1:22:10.717 --> 1:22:11.801
I'll kill you! You motherfucker!

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:12.469
Open up!

1:22:13.262 --> 1:22:14.053
You said "one man"!

1:22:14.054 --> 1:22:15.263
I don't know. Fuck!

1:22:15.264 --> 1:22:16.098
Hold tight!

1:22:16.390 --> 1:22:18.057
Open up, you bastards!

1:22:18.058 --> 1:22:18.976
You motherfucker!

1:22:22.104 --> 1:22:22.938
Behind you!

1:22:24.064 --> 1:22:24.773
Hey!

1:22:25.065 --> 1:22:26.733
Grab it! Grab the knife!

1:22:30.028 --> 1:22:31.947
Newbie! Fuck...

1:22:33.699 --> 1:22:34.658
You alright, man?

1:22:37.870 --> 1:22:38.662
Bastards...

1:23:01.768 --> 1:23:03.144
Do-Cheol, grab that bastard!

1:23:03.145 --> 1:23:04.146
You motherfucker!

1:23:33.258 --> 1:23:34.134
Hey!

1:23:34.426 --> 1:23:35.176
Stop right there!

1:23:35.177 --> 1:23:36.053
Pick up.

1:23:41.308 --> 1:23:42.476
Pick up the damn phone.

1:23:44.144 --> 1:23:45.187
It's Jeon...

1:23:45.479 --> 1:23:46.647
Pick up the phone!

1:23:47.231 --> 1:23:49.066
- Shit...
- We're fucked!

1:24:06.959 --> 1:24:08.627
Go away! Shit...

1:24:15.217 --> 1:24:17.886
You motherfucker, you're fucked!

1:24:22.849 --> 1:24:24.017
You bastard...

1:24:26.979 --> 1:24:28.438
Stop following me! Shit...

1:24:38.699 --> 1:24:39.490
Alright.

1:24:39.491 --> 1:24:40.449
Way to go, Miss Bong!

1:24:40.450 --> 1:24:42.494
Just stop hitting me!

1:24:43.287 --> 1:24:44.663
Stay put, you piece of shit.

1:24:44.955 --> 1:24:46.665
Who are you?!

1:24:46.873 --> 1:24:49.626
Friend of the cop you just stabbed.

1:24:52.379 --> 1:24:54.548
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.966
I was imprisoned by those people.

1:24:56.967 --> 1:25:00.011
I called Mr. Choi
to borrow some money.

1:25:00.012 --> 1:25:02.806
Our newbie got knifed?
Was that him?

1:25:03.515 --> 1:25:05.517
You bastards...

1:25:06.018 --> 1:25:07.351
- Detective Wang.
- Yes, sir.

1:25:07.352 --> 1:25:09.062
- There are some spider webs.
- Got it.

1:25:16.528 --> 1:25:17.486
You fucking asshole!

1:25:17.487 --> 1:25:19.864
Piece of shit!

1:25:19.865 --> 1:25:23.534
Come on! Let's talk!

1:25:23.535 --> 1:25:24.578
Who the fuck?!

1:25:25.037 --> 1:25:27.497
Who knifed the newbie?!

1:25:29.875 --> 1:25:32.544
Are you in charge here?

1:25:32.878 --> 1:25:36.213
Law enforcers can't behave this way!

1:25:36.214 --> 1:25:37.716
Where is the law here?!

1:25:38.675 --> 1:25:40.677
Did you knife my newbie?

1:25:40.969 --> 1:25:42.763
Wasn't me personally, sir.

1:25:46.266 --> 1:25:47.934
You moron!

1:25:48.310 --> 1:25:51.145
How can you let a scumbag
like this get to you?!

1:25:51.146 --> 1:25:52.104
He's got connections.

1:25:52.105 --> 1:25:53.607
Who's got his back? God?

1:25:54.441 --> 1:25:56.526
How dare they touch a cop?!

1:25:58.070 --> 1:25:59.320
I'm telling you,

1:25:59.321 --> 1:26:01.197
before the newbie
wakes up from surgery,

1:26:01.198 --> 1:26:03.158
bring in the motherfucker
responsible for this!

1:26:04.534 --> 1:26:05.952
You heard the man!

1:26:07.829 --> 1:26:10.707
Now, it's conspiracy to murder a cop.

1:26:12.376 --> 1:26:14.460
Did we find something?

1:26:14.461 --> 1:26:16.504
We got something big.

1:26:16.505 --> 1:26:19.507
This bastard got paid in US dollars.

1:26:19.508 --> 1:26:21.592
Here's a passport and
tickets to the Philippines.

1:26:21.593 --> 1:26:24.595
We can track the bank
that issued the cash.

1:26:24.596 --> 1:26:27.516
CCTV from the bank will
lead us right to them.

1:26:27.808 --> 1:26:31.228
We got you, motherfuckers.

1:26:31.561 --> 1:26:33.397
While tracking the cash,

1:26:33.689 --> 1:26:36.649
go back to Sin Jin and
secure the video footage.

1:26:36.650 --> 1:26:37.316
Yes, sir.

1:26:37.317 --> 1:26:39.986
And Bong... You get
the emergency call records.

1:27:18.358 --> 1:27:20.151
I heard you got a big one.

1:27:20.152 --> 1:27:20.944
What?

1:27:21.236 --> 1:27:22.863
I have a visitor. Get lost.

1:27:23.155 --> 1:27:24.865
- Get outta here.
- Bye.

1:27:27.868 --> 1:27:29.578
Please have a seat.

1:27:31.329 --> 1:27:32.247
Did you eat?

1:27:32.914 --> 1:27:34.166
Yes.

1:27:35.917 --> 1:27:40.672
I should've paid you
a visit earlier. I'm sorry.

1:27:40.881 --> 1:27:43.175
No need to apologize.

1:27:43.717 --> 1:27:45.218
And you shouldn't have.

1:27:45.594 --> 1:27:46.678
Thank you.

1:27:49.097 --> 1:27:50.599
How is your husband?

1:27:51.016 --> 1:27:53.225
More time before he's
out of critical condition?

1:27:53.226 --> 1:27:54.728
Seems like it.

1:27:56.021 --> 1:27:58.398
If you stay too long in
the hospital, you'll get sick.

1:27:58.690 --> 1:28:02.986
You need to get some
air once in a while.

1:28:03.779 --> 1:28:06.114
Is your son doing well
at his grandmother's?

1:28:06.490 --> 1:28:08.200
Yes, thanks to you.

1:28:08.784 --> 1:28:10.368
He seemed like a thoughtful boy.

1:28:11.995 --> 1:28:13.997
What can I do for you?

1:28:22.464 --> 1:28:25.258
You know the text
message he sent me.

1:28:25.759 --> 1:28:28.637
I've been looking at it over and over.

1:28:29.095 --> 1:28:31.556
I realized something wasn't right.

1:28:32.015 --> 1:28:35.519
He's never written
a long message like this.

1:28:36.311 --> 1:28:40.565
Even if he wrote it
thinking it was his last,

1:28:42.234 --> 1:28:44.486
his messages are
normally full of typos.

1:28:45.737 --> 1:28:49.783
And he never uses periods.

1:28:51.743 --> 1:28:55.747
He always said he hated
men playing with phones.

1:28:56.248 --> 1:28:59.125
He never got used to
sending text messages.

1:29:02.838 --> 1:29:05.632
You still have his mobile phone?

1:29:16.268 --> 1:29:17.435
I'm sorry.

1:29:17.727 --> 1:29:21.857
We sent lawyers right away to deal
with the situation from last night.

1:29:22.148 --> 1:29:23.441
Take a seat.

1:29:24.276 --> 1:29:25.735
Had no time to eat, did you?

1:29:26.444 --> 1:29:27.696
Let's have a meal.

1:29:30.699 --> 1:29:31.741
Sit down.

1:29:33.326 --> 1:29:35.328
You work without sleep.

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:37.497
You should at least eat well.

1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:39.207
Come on.

1:29:41.167 --> 1:29:43.962
I like the eel from this place.

1:29:44.254 --> 1:29:45.005
Here.

1:29:52.888 --> 1:29:54.806
The cop didn't die, did he?

1:29:56.224 --> 1:30:00.228
He's injured but it's not critical.

1:30:00.854 --> 1:30:03.272
Jeon and the other men at the scene,

1:30:03.273 --> 1:30:06.568
they know they'll be in danger
if they open their mouths.

1:30:08.236 --> 1:30:10.488
We're doing all we can
with the lawyers.

1:30:10.947 --> 1:30:12.866
We have the situation under control.

1:30:15.535 --> 1:30:18.454
As your uncle, I never really
sat down for a meal with you.

1:30:18.455 --> 1:30:20.707
What's the point of living, I wonder.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:24.377
You remind me a lot of your father.

1:30:25.921 --> 1:30:28.048
Working so diligently.

1:30:28.798 --> 1:30:32.719
His last wish was
to look after you like a son.

1:30:34.888 --> 1:30:40.018
I feel bad for you and your clad.

1:30:42.103 --> 1:30:45.231
I will do a better job going forward.

1:30:50.153 --> 1:30:51.154
Dea-Woong.

1:30:52.238 --> 1:30:53.406
Yes, sir.

1:30:54.366 --> 1:30:55.742
We're family, aren't we?

1:30:57.869 --> 1:31:01.498
Show me that I can count on you.

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:08.338
The attempted suicide
and the recent cop incident...

1:31:08.713 --> 1:31:10.382
Why don't you take the fall?

1:31:11.049 --> 1:31:13.009
I'll make sure to put up

1:31:13.885 --> 1:31:16.346
the best of my lawyers to support you.

1:31:17.013 --> 1:31:19.015
I know it will be a hassle.

1:31:19.349 --> 1:31:22.727
But eventually, you'll
be released on parole.

1:31:24.270 --> 1:31:27.607
Your aunt says it'll be hard
for your wife and kids

1:31:27.899 --> 1:31:30.151
to see you in trouble.

1:31:31.194 --> 1:31:34.739
So why don't we send
them to school in the UK?

1:31:35.615 --> 1:31:40.453
You should take charge of
Sin Jin Motors, once it's over.

1:31:41.037 --> 1:31:44.916
You'll be a president.
Your dad would've been proud.

1:31:55.510 --> 1:31:57.302
Who's turning himself in?

1:31:57.303 --> 1:31:57.970
Detective Seo.

1:31:57.971 --> 1:31:58.679
Excuse me,

1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:01.974
but my client is unstable due to
the grave guilt he's feeling.

1:32:01.975 --> 1:32:04.435
Mr. Choi, this isn't right.
Why are you doing this?

1:32:04.436 --> 1:32:06.353
My client requests...

1:32:06.354 --> 1:32:09.858
Will Cho take care of you
for life if you take the fall?

1:32:10.275 --> 1:32:12.401
For instigating assault and
conspiracy to murder?

1:32:12.402 --> 1:32:13.610
Do you know how long
you'll rot in jail?

1:32:13.611 --> 1:32:15.363
Are you threatening my client?

1:32:15.613 --> 1:32:17.407
Conspiracy to murder a police officer?

1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:24.998
<i>Go easy.</i>

1:32:25.999 --> 1:32:27.666
- Why?
- He says to go easy.

1:32:27.667 --> 1:32:28.417
I got it.

1:32:28.418 --> 1:32:32.672
I also feel terrible that a cop got hurt.

1:32:33.048 --> 1:32:35.299
I misunderstood Jeon.

1:32:35.300 --> 1:32:37.635
He said he would
take care of the problem.

1:32:37.927 --> 1:32:39.428
I had no idea he meant murder...

1:32:39.429 --> 1:32:40.846
How much are you
getting paid for this?!

1:32:40.847 --> 1:32:43.640
If you keep this up, we'll move
to the original jurisdiction!

1:32:43.641 --> 1:32:46.435
They closed the case!
That's why you're here!

1:32:46.436 --> 1:32:47.478
Who's in charge?!

1:32:47.479 --> 1:32:49.688
Out! Now!

1:32:49.689 --> 1:32:50.481
Hold on...

1:32:50.482 --> 1:32:52.567
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1:32:53.151 --> 1:32:54.527
Excuse me.

1:32:55.153 --> 1:32:59.364
Mr. Choi, I'm really curious.
So, let me just ask you this.

1:32:59.365 --> 1:33:00.657
Ask what?

1:33:00.658 --> 1:33:01.743
- You don't have to answer.
- No.

1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:03.495
Let him ask.

1:33:05.914 --> 1:33:07.748
Don't you think it's strange?

1:33:07.749 --> 1:33:10.543
When an apology could have
easily ended it...

1:33:10.835 --> 1:33:12.587
how did it get blown up like this?

1:33:13.254 --> 1:33:16.382
You must be used to
being criticized by society.

1:33:16.966 --> 1:33:20.261
Why go through so much
trouble to cover this up?

1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:24.182
That's why I turned myself in.
So it doesn't get bigger.

1:33:27.936 --> 1:33:30.814
You guys are real bastards.

1:33:31.106 --> 1:33:34.441
The order is to transfer
the case to a different team.

1:33:34.442 --> 1:33:36.902
What about the attempted
murder of our newbie?

1:33:36.903 --> 1:33:38.446
We got a confession.

1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:42.575
Transfer everything related to
Sin Jin Trading to Team 1.

1:33:43.118 --> 1:33:46.453
You'll get promoted to
the central investigative unit.

1:33:46.454 --> 1:33:48.414
Other members will get
new assignments, too.

1:33:48.665 --> 1:33:50.333
You're breaking up my team?

1:33:56.756 --> 1:33:57.757
Boss.

1:34:02.428 --> 1:34:03.638
You're here.

1:34:03.930 --> 1:34:05.014
Hey, man.

1:34:05.765 --> 1:34:08.226
They're transferring our
cases and splitting us up?

1:34:09.144 --> 1:34:10.854
Not exactly.

1:34:11.187 --> 1:34:13.606
It's not like we're getting fired.

1:34:14.190 --> 1:34:15.440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

1:34:15.441 --> 1:34:16.567
Why should we get fired?!

1:34:16.568 --> 1:34:17.527
Do-Cheol!

1:34:18.236 --> 1:34:20.488
Bong, did you look into it?

1:34:21.489 --> 1:34:22.781
What did you get her to do?

1:34:22.782 --> 1:34:24.283
Did you find out?

1:34:24.284 --> 1:34:28.954
There was an emergency call
from Sin Jin that was canceled.

1:34:28.955 --> 1:34:31.207
Doesn't match the time
that Bae sent the text.

1:34:31.499 --> 1:34:36.087
The emergency call was officially logged in
at 11:39 AM on the day of the incident.

1:34:36.421 --> 1:34:39.048
From another number
at the Sin Jin location.

1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:41.758
The call was terminated
while it was being processed.

1:34:41.759 --> 1:34:44.636
The emergency center
called back at 11:22 AM.

1:34:44.637 --> 1:34:47.347
REPORT DATE REPORT DETAILS Emergency Call Records Call disconnected during call Callback
attempted Caller claims it was a missed call But the caller did not want to process the report.

1:34:47.348 --> 1:34:50.393
But the text message
from Bae to his wife

1:34:50.685 --> 1:34:54.147
was sent 15 minutes later at 11:37 AM.

1:34:54.898 --> 1:34:56.773
If the accident happened
right before the first call...

1:34:56.774 --> 1:35:00.694
That means Bae sent his
text after the accident.

1:35:00.695 --> 1:35:06.993
And lunch time was taken
30 minutes earlier than usual.

1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:09.912
The bastards cleared the whole floor.

1:35:09.913 --> 1:35:12.873
Do you see?
The accident was a setup.

1:35:12.874 --> 1:35:14.292
Give me just one more day.

1:35:14.626 --> 1:35:16.168
I'll bet my house on this.

1:35:16.169 --> 1:35:17.378
I thought you were renting.

1:35:17.670 --> 1:35:18.546
You punk!

1:35:19.589 --> 1:35:22.382
How can you harass me
so early in the morning?

1:35:22.383 --> 1:35:26.054
I don't think we should talk
without my lawyer present.

1:35:26.679 --> 1:35:28.973
I'm not here to investigate
but to say hello.

1:35:29.390 --> 1:35:32.018
We'll talk about
the same thing anyhow.

1:35:32.477 --> 1:35:35.771
If you've got time to waste,
spend it with your kids.

1:35:35.772 --> 1:35:36.898
They grow up fast.

1:35:37.273 --> 1:35:40.652
Worry about yourself
rather than talking shit.

1:35:41.236 --> 1:35:42.737
Really gonna confess?

1:35:43.238 --> 1:35:45.698
To aiding in assault and
conspiring to murder?

1:35:45.907 --> 1:35:48.284
I told you I didn't know
about killing a cop.

1:35:51.496 --> 1:35:52.454
Is that all?

1:35:52.455 --> 1:35:55.416
Let's continue this in a formal manner.

1:35:55.959 --> 1:35:59.378
I didn't get a good night's sleep.

1:35:59.379 --> 1:36:00.338
Sit your ass down.

1:36:09.597 --> 1:36:10.682
Why did you do it?

1:36:11.057 --> 1:36:13.225
He didn't try to kill himself.

1:36:13.226 --> 1:36:14.518
We're done here.

1:36:14.519 --> 1:36:18.189
Shut up and sit down!
This is my district, son of a bitch!

1:36:18.773 --> 1:36:21.693
You should at least know
what crimes you're confessing to.

1:36:26.698 --> 1:36:29.199
Bae got beat up by the contractor, Jeon.

1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:30.743
You paid him off.

1:36:31.077 --> 1:36:32.996
He sent his kid home in a cab.

1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:35.415
But Bae...

1:36:36.624 --> 1:36:39.002
felt so aggrieved and angry.

1:36:39.836 --> 1:36:41.963
So, he goes back to find you guys.

1:36:43.089 --> 1:36:45.174
Facts are confirmed up to this point.

1:36:46.175 --> 1:36:46.968
But...

1:36:49.429 --> 1:36:51.222
Then, the real accident happened.

1:36:52.515 --> 1:36:55.727
Cho Tae-Oh touched Bae.

1:36:56.311 --> 1:37:00.106
One of the guards in
the room called emergency.

1:37:00.857 --> 1:37:04.735
But a bastard who's quick on his feet

1:37:04.736 --> 1:37:06.696
decides to fix the situation.

1:37:12.035 --> 1:37:13.077
Conclusion...

1:37:13.703 --> 1:37:16.456
Bae didn't try to kill himself.

1:37:17.373 --> 1:37:20.001
You bastards staged it as a suicide.

1:37:29.385 --> 1:37:31.137
Just for a few bucks, I뭢 living like a peasant. I can't do this anymore.
In order to teach the rich a lesson, this is all I can do. Forgive nee.

1:37:46.819 --> 1:37:49.238
That's a really good story.

1:37:50.198 --> 1:37:51.032
But...

1:37:52.408 --> 1:37:53.701
do you have evidence?

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:03.961
Please come in.

1:38:09.675 --> 1:38:12.344
Athletes have a lot of fear.

1:38:12.345 --> 1:38:15.848
There was a call to 911
from this man's mobile.

1:38:16.015 --> 1:38:20.228
It's not ethical to fire a man
because of a broken leg.

1:38:21.729 --> 1:38:23.855
Can you put him on the witness stand?

1:38:23.856 --> 1:38:26.526
Of course, and there are others.

1:38:26.776 --> 1:38:29.236
Contractor Jeon in jail
also has lots of skeletons.

1:38:29.237 --> 1:38:30.822
You've also got dirt.

1:38:32.448 --> 1:38:35.534
I forgot to mention
that Jeon blackmailed us.

1:38:35.535 --> 1:38:37.744
How far do you think
your money will take you?

1:38:37.745 --> 1:38:40.414
How far do you think you can
take this as a lowly cop?

1:38:40.415 --> 1:38:41.915
3 years for assault,

1:38:41.916 --> 1:38:44.376
5 years for attempted murder
and trying to stage a suicide,

1:38:44.377 --> 1:38:46.754
conspiracy to murder
a police officer, at least 5!

1:38:47.088 --> 1:38:49.756
Can't change the facts no matter
who you have in your pocket!

1:38:49.757 --> 1:38:50.883
Look here.

1:38:52.218 --> 1:38:53.718
A trader sells what he sees

1:38:53.719 --> 1:38:56.138
but a businessman invests in
what isn't apparent to the eye.

1:38:56.139 --> 1:39:00.268
I'm investing my precious time here.

1:39:00.768 --> 1:39:02.937
Bad investment decision.

1:39:03.855 --> 1:39:06.232
Director Cho is leaving for
Singapore tomorrow morning.

1:39:06.566 --> 1:39:09.986
Are you confident
you can arrest him tonight?

1:39:13.656 --> 1:39:16.117
You should've invested in me.

1:39:22.999 --> 1:39:24.167
What's up?

1:39:26.127 --> 1:39:27.419
How's the ankle?

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:31.257
I was just wondering
what you were up to.

1:39:32.425 --> 1:39:35.261
I guess you'll have some time
after Cho leaves the country.

1:39:36.053 --> 1:39:37.138
Alright...

1:39:37.597 --> 1:39:39.474
Call me when you're free.

1:39:41.058 --> 1:39:43.143
He is definitely leaving tomorrow, early.

1:39:43.144 --> 1:39:44.854
There's a party tonight.

1:39:45.062 --> 1:39:48.023
If this bastard gets to
Singapore on his private jet,

1:39:48.024 --> 1:39:50.400
he can get his blood cleansed.

1:39:50.401 --> 1:39:52.486
That would get rid of
all the evidence of drug use.

1:39:52.487 --> 1:39:55.489
He's worked closely
with the bodyguards.

1:39:55.490 --> 1:39:56.616
I know.

1:39:56.908 --> 1:39:58.826
I get your story.

1:39:59.118 --> 1:40:03.371
But who in their right mind would
throw a drug party in this situation?

1:40:03.372 --> 1:40:06.082
He would want to make sure
that his loyal cronies

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:09.711
will cover his back while
he's out of the country.

1:40:09.712 --> 1:40:11.047
If you look at the VIP roster...

1:40:12.798 --> 1:40:15.218
What if we can't find anything?

1:40:15.676 --> 1:40:18.387
We wouldn't raise the stakes
without a backup plan.

1:40:20.264 --> 1:40:22.266
Stop bullshitting.

1:40:22.558 --> 1:40:24.809
If you really want to score
before the team splits,

1:40:24.810 --> 1:40:26.645
take care of that
housewives gambling case!

1:40:26.646 --> 1:40:27.979
Come on, boss!

1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:31.816
- Don't do this to us!
- I made myself clear.

1:40:31.817 --> 1:40:34.110
Did I ever let you down?!

1:40:34.111 --> 1:40:35.862
Who took care of
all the family events?!

1:40:35.863 --> 1:40:38.323
Your wedding, your kids'
birthdays and anniversaries...

1:40:38.324 --> 1:40:40.700
When your father passed away,
I even followed you to the graveyard!

1:40:40.701 --> 1:40:44.538
My team took care of
your in-laws' funerals!

1:40:44.539 --> 1:40:45.330
And this?!

1:40:45.331 --> 1:40:47.958
Because you had to attend
your daughter's graduation,

1:40:47.959 --> 1:40:51.087
I went to the scene
by myself and got stabbed!

1:40:51.879 --> 1:40:55.757
It's only because you were
reckless, you bastard!

1:40:55.758 --> 1:40:57.008
What about me?!

1:40:57.009 --> 1:40:59.719
When you went alone to
Youngdeungpo and caused trouble,

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:02.389
I got this while trying
to watch your back!

1:41:02.390 --> 1:41:05.268
You guys are just too much.

1:41:05.726 --> 1:41:09.479
When I got this leg
fucked up in Incheon,

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:10.897
where were you guys?!

1:41:10.898 --> 1:41:12.233
At the sauna!

1:41:12.525 --> 1:41:16.153
I get such pain whenever
it rains that I can't sleep!

1:41:20.408 --> 1:41:23.202
Are we asking for much?

1:41:23.536 --> 1:41:25.413
Just let us do our jobs.

1:41:25.830 --> 1:41:27.248
You'll let them break us up?

1:41:27.415 --> 1:41:28.958
Look.

1:41:29.834 --> 1:41:33.546
I heard these housewives
go everywhere.

1:41:34.088 --> 1:41:36.924
Perhaps they'll be at
Cho Tae-Oh's party tonight.

1:41:38.509 --> 1:41:42.305
What are you still doing here?

1:41:43.848 --> 1:41:48.018
I made myself clear that I want you
to take care of the gambling housewives.

1:41:48.019 --> 1:41:49.395
From what I hear,

1:41:49.687 --> 1:41:54.687
the mobs involved in
the gambling rings are the craziest.

1:41:56.944 --> 1:41:59.696
That's why we're here to support.

1:41:59.697 --> 1:42:04.118
Shouldn't we get suited up
in protective gear?

1:42:04.577 --> 1:42:07.204
Cops make history with their bodies.

1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:09.706
My intestines were spilling out,

1:42:09.707 --> 1:42:11.792
I had to stuff them back in
on the way to the hospital.

1:42:19.050 --> 1:42:20.468
Hey, baby. It's me.

1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:23.846
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1:42:24.430 --> 1:42:25.556
Why are you cursing?

1:42:26.349 --> 1:42:28.017
How's our boy?

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:37.859
That white car

1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:40.779
belongs to the nephew
of the ex-prime minister.

1:42:40.780 --> 1:42:43.406
Behind him is the CEO of JD Telecoms.

1:42:43.407 --> 1:42:46.409
- And that's an actress' car.
- Which one?

1:42:46.410 --> 1:42:47.661
Can't remember the name...

1:42:47.662 --> 1:42:48.788
Slow down!

1:42:49.205 --> 1:42:50.164
Detective Wang.

1:42:50.456 --> 1:42:52.583
Check all the cars carefully.

1:43:02.176 --> 1:43:03.177
<i>Standby.</i>

1:43:03.469 --> 1:43:06.347
<i>The cosmetic surgeon has
arrived with his bag.</i>

1:43:07.014 --> 1:43:08.264
It's Cho Tae-Oh.

1:43:08.265 --> 1:43:09.808
Where?

1:43:09.809 --> 1:43:11.518
- There! The black sports car.
- Where, you bastard?!

1:43:11.519 --> 1:43:12.686
The one turning...
next to the middle lane.

1:43:12.687 --> 1:43:14.771
Wang, we've got Cho's car in sight.

1:43:14.772 --> 1:43:17.066
60 dollar fine for illegal U-turn.

1:43:17.316 --> 1:43:19.901
Since Cho Tae-Oh's here,
they'll start the party.

1:43:19.902 --> 1:43:21.654
Let's go pick up the trash.

1:44:04.864 --> 1:44:06.198
What's that vehicle?

1:44:06.449 --> 1:44:08.450
Hey, Wang. I see a suspicious vehicle!

1:44:08.451 --> 1:44:09.785
Check that car!

1:44:12.747 --> 1:44:14.665
It's Jeong Da-Hye.

1:44:19.128 --> 1:44:19.919
Back off.

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:20.920
You can't go in.

1:44:20.921 --> 1:44:21.880
Step aside!

1:44:21.881 --> 1:44:22.714
We can't.

1:44:22.715 --> 1:44:23.841
Don't you know who I am?

1:44:24.258 --> 1:44:25.217
<i>Seo.</i>

1:44:25.509 --> 1:44:28.470
<i>Looks like she's here to spoil the party.</i>

1:44:28.471 --> 1:44:29.554
<i>What if she messes it up?</i>

1:44:29.555 --> 1:44:31.639
Don't say it, it's bad luck.

1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:33.517
I'll kick your ass back at the station!

1:44:40.024 --> 1:44:42.317
Mr. Cho wants to
see you quietly. Let's go.

1:44:42.318 --> 1:44:43.194
Where?

1:44:43.694 --> 1:44:45.738
I will kill you
if you're playing with me.

1:45:16.060 --> 1:45:17.686
Why the fuck did you show up here?

1:45:17.853 --> 1:45:19.271
How can you do this?

1:45:19.563 --> 1:45:21.106
I'm pregnant with your child!

1:45:22.358 --> 1:45:23.984
I can take it out right here.

1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:27.404
You call yourself a human being?

1:45:30.574 --> 1:45:34.036
When do they shoot up usually?

1:45:37.414 --> 1:45:39.917
You, son of a bitch!

1:45:42.670 --> 1:45:44.046
You ready, Miss Bong?

1:45:48.342 --> 1:45:50.134
There's someone dying in this building!

1:45:50.135 --> 1:45:52.763
Her clothes are ripped!
She's being raped!

1:45:53.097 --> 1:45:54.974
What?! An assault?!

1:45:56.684 --> 1:45:58.477
We're on our way.

1:46:00.229 --> 1:46:02.731
Why? What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1:46:03.357 --> 1:46:05.484
It's just from
that building over there.

1:46:05.776 --> 1:46:08.736
Someone is trying to
sexually assault a lady.

1:46:08.737 --> 1:46:10.655
It must be the housewives!

1:46:10.656 --> 1:46:12.283
We gotta go now!

1:46:14.118 --> 1:46:15.327
Come on.

1:46:18.956 --> 1:46:22.585
Your household pet gets surprised
when it looks in the mirror.

1:46:22.835 --> 1:46:26.088
It thought it was a person
but it's just a bitch.

1:46:27.923 --> 1:46:30.384
Let's not fight.

1:46:30.968 --> 1:46:32.845
We were so good together.

1:46:34.388 --> 1:46:37.892
Can you just renew
my endorsement contract?

1:46:38.183 --> 1:46:39.101
Then,

1:46:39.393 --> 1:46:43.105
I'll get rid of the baby
and stay quiet, okay?

1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:47.818
I want to be on good terms with you.

1:46:48.736 --> 1:46:51.113
Why do you always try to use me?

1:46:51.530 --> 1:46:53.407
Just have fun tonight.

1:47:09.256 --> 1:47:10.340
Sorry to disturb you at night.

1:47:10.341 --> 1:47:12.967
There's no trouble here.

1:47:12.968 --> 1:47:15.470
But there was a call.

1:47:15.471 --> 1:47:16.763
Do you have a search warrant?

1:47:16.764 --> 1:47:18.974
Search warrant, my ass!

1:47:19.266 --> 1:47:23.061
If we get an emergency call, we're
obligated to search without a warrant.

1:47:23.062 --> 1:47:24.479
You want the report number?

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:25.522
Director Cho!

1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:27.316
What?

1:47:30.069 --> 1:47:32.446
You're interfering with official business.

1:47:32.863 --> 1:47:35.157
We're protecting private property.

1:47:36.033 --> 1:47:37.408
Run them over!

1:47:37.409 --> 1:47:38.327
Block them!

1:47:42.164 --> 1:47:43.122
<i>HEY-</i>

1:47:43.123 --> 1:47:47.002
You don't want anything happening
to me or my friends here.

1:47:47.878 --> 1:47:49.420
Stop them.

1:47:49.421 --> 1:47:51.006
I don't care how you do it.

1:47:52.758 --> 1:47:54.677
I'm hurt!

1:47:55.844 --> 1:47:57.053
Don't come!

1:47:57.054 --> 1:47:57.888
Blood!

1:48:01.767 --> 1:48:02.768
Let go, you bastard!

1:48:03.894 --> 1:48:05.062
Let go, you bastard!

1:48:09.650 --> 1:48:11.193
You're asking for it!

1:48:21.453 --> 1:48:23.747
I really didn't want to use this.

1:48:24.248 --> 1:48:26.291
Permission to open fire, detectives!

1:48:27.334 --> 1:48:29.211
You only brought your gun?

1:48:33.382 --> 1:48:34.758
Why don't you pick up?!

1:48:36.176 --> 1:48:38.094
Get the jet ready!

1:48:38.095 --> 1:48:39.721
I'm leaving earlier than planned.

1:48:39.722 --> 1:48:41.264
Singapore... no...

1:48:41.265 --> 1:48:43.684
Hong Kong or Malaysia, anywhere!

1:48:44.643 --> 1:48:46.687
I'll be at the airport in one hour.

1:48:46.854 --> 1:48:48.188
You need a card to go up?

1:48:48.689 --> 1:48:50.065
Hurry up and open this.

1:48:51.233 --> 1:48:52.818
What's this?

1:48:55.029 --> 1:48:56.405
Get inside.

1:48:56.989 --> 1:48:57.864
Inside.

1:48:57.865 --> 1:48:58.614
Hurry.

1:48:58.615 --> 1:49:01.785
It's a maze. How can we find him?

1:49:03.328 --> 1:49:04.621
Hey, where are you going?

1:49:09.418 --> 1:49:10.461
Fuck!

1:49:15.257 --> 1:49:16.090
Da-Hye!

1:49:16.091 --> 1:49:17.593

1:49:20.262 --> 1:49:21.847
Line them up.

1:49:30.189 --> 1:49:31.398
Da-Hye...

1:49:37.446 --> 1:49:38.155
Hey!

1:49:38.447 --> 1:49:39.156
Yes?

1:49:39.364 --> 1:49:40.240
What are you doing?

1:49:41.325 --> 1:49:42.408
It's not what it looks...

1:49:42.409 --> 1:49:44.286
You little fuck!

1:49:45.829 --> 1:49:48.165
Look at these idiots.

1:49:48.916 --> 1:49:50.000
Hey! Everyone!

1:49:50.626 --> 1:49:53.087
We're the police!

1:49:53.796 --> 1:49:55.506
Fuckheads!

1:50:17.653 --> 1:50:20.155
You guys should know better.

1:50:21.323 --> 1:50:24.450
You're under arrest for violation
of drug enforcement laws

1:50:24.451 --> 1:50:27.121
and protection of minors
against sexual abuse.

1:50:28.038 --> 1:50:29.456
Caught in the act.

1:50:30.833 --> 1:50:32.376
You guys are fucked.

1:50:44.847 --> 1:50:45.931
Cho Tae-Oh!

1:52:01.548 --> 1:52:03.425
That son of a bitch!

1:52:08.138 --> 1:52:09.223
Shit!

1:53:44.526 --> 1:53:45.443
Are you alright?

1:53:45.444 --> 1:53:47.570
- Are you okay?
- You alright?

1:53:47.571 --> 1:53:49.197
- Looks like you're hurt.
- I'm alright. I'm fine.

1:53:56.663 --> 1:53:57.748
Cho Tae-Oh!

1:54:03.628 --> 1:54:05.796
Violation of drug
enforcement regulations.

1:54:05.797 --> 1:54:07.548
Violation of prostitution
enforcement regulations.

1:54:07.549 --> 1:54:10.343
Violation of laws on the protection
of minors against sexual abuse.

1:54:10.344 --> 1:54:11.386
Drunk driving, speeding,

1:54:11.636 --> 1:54:14.096
destruction of public property,
interference with official business,

1:54:14.097 --> 1:54:16.223
assault and attempted
murder of Bae Cheol-Ho.

1:54:16.224 --> 1:54:18.727
You're under arrest
for all of these charges.

1:54:19.019 --> 1:54:21.146
You have the right to remain silent

1:54:21.313 --> 1:54:23.439
and the right to appoint a lawyer.

1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.277
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1:54:28.278 --> 1:54:30.530
I told you to stay out of
trouble, son of a bitch.

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:34.284
You really want this?

1:55:42.936 --> 1:55:45.397
You should know your place.

1:55:54.614 --> 1:55:55.323
Piss off.

1:55:55.699 --> 1:55:56.533
Get out of the way!

1:55:56.908 --> 1:55:57.951
Back off!

1:55:58.535 --> 1:55:59.578
<i>HEY-</i>

1:56:02.414 --> 1:56:04.666
You have a foul mouth, young man.

1:56:05.292 --> 1:56:06.960
- Just ignore him.
- Wait.

1:56:07.252 --> 1:56:08.961
I'm the owner of this stationery store.

1:56:08.962 --> 1:56:10.922
You can't just go after making this mess.

1:56:11.214 --> 1:56:12.089
Piss off.

1:56:12.090 --> 1:56:13.967
What is he doing?

1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:16.803
I said piss off.

1:56:17.179 --> 1:56:18.305
Hey!

1:56:23.518 --> 1:56:27.856
Add assault of a police officer to the list!
They got it all, you motherfucker!

1:56:33.695 --> 1:56:35.405
It's justified defense from now on.

1:57:51.064 --> 1:57:53.483
How long you think it'll take
for me to make this go away?

1:57:54.276 --> 1:57:55.402
30 minutes?

1:57:55.694 --> 1:57:58.445
One hour tops, you fucking bastard.

1:57:58.446 --> 1:57:59.614
You piece of shit!

1:58:01.575 --> 1:58:04.536
It'll take 20 fucking years.

1:58:07.455 --> 1:58:09.457
Fucking hell...

1:58:09.833 --> 1:58:11.835
I'll be damned.

1:58:15.380 --> 1:58:17.632
Great job, Miss Bong.

1:58:17.924 --> 1:58:20.342
Why did you use your leg?
What if he got hurt?

1:58:20.343 --> 1:58:21.344
Are you okay?

1:58:21.845 --> 1:58:23.138
Hurts like hell.

1:58:23.430 --> 1:58:25.431
This little shit can fight.

1:58:25.432 --> 1:58:26.683
So you're fine.

1:58:27.183 --> 1:58:29.227
Have it looked at at the hospital.

1:58:29.519 --> 1:58:30.936
He looks very familiar.

1:58:30.937 --> 1:58:31.937
I'm sorry.

1:58:31.938 --> 1:58:32.730
Fuck you!

1:58:32.731 --> 1:58:35.817
No pictures.
