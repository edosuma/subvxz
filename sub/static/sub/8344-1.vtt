00:39.162 --> 00:42.063
The year, 1462.

00:42.265 --> 00:45.428
Constantinople had fallen.

00:45.635 --> 00:49.505
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...

00:49.605 --> 00:53.711
...striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

00:53.811 --> 00:56.347
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight...

00:56.447 --> 01:00.767
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.061
On the eve of the battle...

01:19.269 --> 01:21.932
...his bride Elisabeta...

01:22.140 --> 01:25.343
...whom he prized above all things on Earth...

01:25.443 --> 01:29.603
...knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

01:29.692 --> 01:33.344
...from which he might never return.

02:31.111 --> 02:34.979
God be praised.
I am victorious.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.683
Elisabeta.

02:49.597 --> 02:53.468
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...

02:53.568 --> 02:56.928
...carrying false news of Dracula's death.

02:56.983 --> 02:59.600
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

02:59.807 --> 03:02.674
...flung herself into the river.

03:41.416 --> 03:43.850
My prince is dead.

03:44.052 --> 03:46.078
All is lost without him.

03:46.289 --> 03:49.019
May God unite us in heaven.

04:03.606 --> 04:05.766
She has taken her own life.

04:06.142 --> 04:08.576
Her soul cannot be saved.

04:09.779 --> 04:11.779
She is damned.

04:11.948 --> 04:13.949
It is God's law.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.497
Is this my reward for defending God's church?

04:26.597 --> 04:27.665
Sacrilege.

04:27.765 --> 04:31.360
I renounce God.

04:32.236 --> 04:35.831
I shall rise from my own death...

04:36.106 --> 04:40.600
...to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness.

04:58.363 --> 05:01.423
The blood is the life...

05:02.334 --> 05:06.395
...and it shall be mine.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.682
I've done everything that you asked, master.

06:07.335 --> 06:10.532
All the preparations are in order.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.440
Everything.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.202
I await your command.

06:15.410 --> 06:17.970
For I know...

06:18.179 --> 06:21.307
...that when the rewards are given...

06:21.516 --> 06:26.316
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.625
Thank you.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.723
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.836
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

06:40.936 --> 06:43.439
I want you to take over for his foreign client...

06:43.539 --> 06:45.641
...this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

06:45.741 --> 06:48.977
He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

06:49.077 --> 06:51.914
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

06:52.014 --> 06:55.117
This is a great opportunity for you, Harker.

06:55.217 --> 06:58.387
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.

06:58.487 --> 07:02.124
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

07:02.224 --> 07:04.489
Yes, of course, sir.

07:04.694 --> 07:06.262
If I may inquire...

07:06.362 --> 07:10.033
...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

07:10.133 --> 07:12.260
Nothing. Nothing.

07:12.469 --> 07:14.469
Personal problems.

07:14.537 --> 07:16.406
Close these transactions...

07:16.506 --> 07:19.709
...and your future with this firm is assured.

07:19.809 --> 07:23.169
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

07:26.783 --> 07:29.503
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

07:29.561 --> 07:32.121
We can be married when I return.

07:33.724 --> 07:35.159
Of course.

07:35.259 --> 07:37.591
I'll write.

07:38.629 --> 07:40.629
Jonathan.

07:45.035 --> 07:47.035
Jonathan, I love you.

07:47.103 --> 07:49.103
I love you, Mina.

08:19.371 --> 08:21.771
25th May, Budapest.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.342
Left Budapest early this morning.

08:24.442 --> 08:27.245
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

08:27.345 --> 08:29.346
...and entering the east.

08:30.016 --> 08:33.885
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

08:33.986 --> 08:35.688
...just on the borders of three states...

08:35.788 --> 08:38.457
...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

08:38.558 --> 08:40.726
...in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

08:40.826 --> 08:45.386
...one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

08:47.066 --> 08:49.398
'My friend...

08:49.602 --> 08:52.765
...welcome to the Carpathians.

08:52.972 --> 08:56.100
I am anxiously expecting you.

08:56.309 --> 08:58.310
At the Borgo Pass...

08:58.445 --> 09:02.149
...my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

09:02.249 --> 09:07.016
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one...

09:07.220 --> 09:10.057
...and that you will enjoy your stay...

09:10.157 --> 09:13.217
...in my beautiful land.

09:13.427 --> 09:17.261
Your friend, D. ”

09:25.572 --> 09:28.337
Diary, 25th May.

09:28.543 --> 09:31.774
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

09:32.046 --> 09:35.884
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

09:35.984 --> 09:39.287
...I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

09:39.387 --> 09:42.151
I am longing to hear all the news.

09:42.357 --> 09:46.191
It must be so nice to see strange countries.

09:46.394 --> 09:49.564
I wonder if we...
I mean Jonathan and I...

09:49.664 --> 09:52.224
...shall ever see them together.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.345
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

10:10.419 --> 10:12.649
For the dead travel fast.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.962
I say, is the castle far?

12:50.151 --> 12:52.517
Welcome to my home.

12:53.688 --> 12:55.857
Enter freely of your own will...

12:55.957 --> 12:58.927
...and leave some of the happiness you bring.

12:59.027 --> 13:00.895
Count Dracula?

13:00.995 --> 13:02.995
I am...

13:03.063 --> 13:05.063
...Dracula.

13:05.166 --> 13:08.897
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

13:12.173 --> 13:14.174
Come in.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.025
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

13:33.229 --> 13:35.424
...do not join you.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.963
But I have already dined.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.768
And I never drink...

13:47.210 --> 13:49.337
...wine.

13:54.284 --> 13:57.617
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

13:59.556 --> 14:02.616
The Order of the Dracul.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.188
The Dragon.

14:07.397 --> 14:09.729
An ancient society...

14:09.933 --> 14:13.495
...pledging my forefathers...

14:13.704 --> 14:18.184
...to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

14:20.978 --> 14:24.846
That relationship was not entirely...

14:26.317 --> 14:28.317
...successful.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.402
Oh, yes.

14:34.158 --> 14:37.150
It is no laughing matter.

14:40.299 --> 14:43.894
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

14:44.102 --> 14:47.072
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

14:47.172 --> 14:50.471
...whose blood flows in these veins?

14:55.380 --> 14:57.380
Blood...

15:01.653 --> 15:05.851
...is too precious a thing in these times.

15:10.229 --> 15:14.495
The warlike days are over.

15:15.535 --> 15:19.699
The victories of my great race...

15:19.906 --> 15:22.602
...are but a tale to be told.

15:25.678 --> 15:29.671
I am the last of my kind.

15:32.185 --> 15:35.785
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

15:36.322 --> 15:38.323
Forgive me.

15:50.304 --> 15:53.741
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...

15:53.841 --> 15:56.036
...of your mighty London...

15:56.243 --> 16:01.015
...to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

16:01.115 --> 16:03.379
...to share its life...

16:03.584 --> 16:06.577
...its changes, its death.

16:06.788 --> 16:10.155
There. You, Count, are...

16:12.694 --> 16:15.330
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

16:15.430 --> 16:17.591
Congratulations.

16:17.799 --> 16:20.495
Your firm writes most highly...

16:20.702 --> 16:22.103
...of your talents.

16:22.203 --> 16:25.969
They say you are a man of good...

16:26.174 --> 16:28.174
...taste.

16:29.577 --> 16:32.180
And that you are a worthy substitute...

16:32.280 --> 16:37.048
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

16:37.253 --> 16:39.847
You may rely on me, Count.

16:40.056 --> 16:42.825
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

16:42.925 --> 16:45.661
...in such precise locations around London?

16:45.761 --> 16:48.355
Is it to raise the market value?

16:51.067 --> 16:53.627
Do you believe in destiny?

16:56.539 --> 17:01.135
That even the powers of time...

17:01.343 --> 17:04.540
...can be altered for a single purpose?

17:13.924 --> 17:16.425
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...

17:16.526 --> 17:19.619
...is the one who finds...

17:19.829 --> 17:22.060
...true love.

17:22.265 --> 17:24.926
You found Mina.

17:25.135 --> 17:27.433
I thought she was lost.

17:27.637 --> 17:30.838
We're to be married as soon as I return.

17:30.975 --> 17:33.000
Are you married, Count?

17:34.378 --> 17:35.546
Sir...

17:35.646 --> 17:37.646
...are you married?

17:38.916 --> 17:41.749
I was married once.

17:41.953 --> 17:44.148
Ages ago, it seems.

17:45.423 --> 17:47.423
She died.

17:49.293 --> 17:51.293
I'm very sorry.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.361
She was fortunate.

17:55.967 --> 17:59.335
My life, at its best, is misery.

18:04.143 --> 18:07.183
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.848
And you a faithful husband.

18:14.353 --> 18:16.021
Come.

18:16.121 --> 18:19.716
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

18:19.925 --> 18:23.862
...and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

18:23.962 --> 18:25.962
...to stay with me...

18:26.165 --> 18:28.246
...until a month from now.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.602
A month?

18:32.639 --> 18:35.119
Do you wish me to stay so long?

18:37.443 --> 18:41.243
I will take no refusal.

18:52.592 --> 18:56.085
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

18:56.297 --> 19:00.935
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

19:01.035 --> 19:05.372
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

19:05.472 --> 19:09.343
...I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

19:09.443 --> 19:12.246
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

19:12.346 --> 19:17.146
...and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

19:24.759 --> 19:26.920
How disgustingly awful.

19:29.898 --> 19:31.898
Mina.

19:37.105 --> 19:39.972
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

19:41.376 --> 19:43.378
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

19:43.478 --> 19:47.215
...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

19:47.315 --> 19:49.584
When he could be forcing you to perform...

19:49.684 --> 19:53.890
...unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.591
Lucy, really.

19:55.691 --> 19:58.594
You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.

19:58.694 --> 20:02.374
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

20:02.632 --> 20:06.159
Oh, Mina. So I see.

20:06.369 --> 20:08.735
Much, much more.

20:11.173 --> 20:13.173
That's...

20:15.411 --> 20:17.675
What is it, Lucy?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.314
Because I don't understand it.

20:21.218 --> 20:23.778
Can a man and woman really do...

20:24.021 --> 20:25.289
...that?

20:25.389 --> 20:27.857
I did, only last night.

20:28.058 --> 20:30.754
Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

20:32.062 --> 20:34.997
Well, in my dreams.

20:35.198 --> 20:37.996
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

20:38.201 --> 20:40.201
You can tell Lucy.

20:41.204 --> 20:43.638
We've kissed. That's all.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.720
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

20:47.978 --> 20:51.482
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

20:51.582 --> 20:53.251
...my rich friend.

20:53.351 --> 20:56.787
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

20:56.988 --> 20:59.252
And here I am, almost 20...

20:59.457 --> 21:01.721
...practically a hag.

21:07.565 --> 21:10.398
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.466
Oh, look.
- What is that?

21:15.673 --> 21:17.834
A Texan.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.043
Quincey P. Morris.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.975
He's so young and fresh...

21:23.182 --> 21:25.451
...like a wild stallion between my legs.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.586
You're positively indecent.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.120
I just know what men desire.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.024
Watch.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.649
Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.763
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.863
Oh, thank you.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.261
Please let me touch it.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.299
It's so big.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.948
Little girl.

21:55.048 --> 21:58.176
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.444
I hold your hand...

22:00.653 --> 22:03.133
...and you've kissed me.
- Jack.

22:04.257 --> 22:07.715
Oceans of love...
Oh, Jack, my darling.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.629
Poor little baby.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.665
My kitten, come over here.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.000
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.262
My poor little blossom.

22:16.470 --> 22:19.590
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.740
Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

22:21.791 --> 22:24.111
What a naughty bear.
Let me...

22:24.178 --> 22:27.306
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur.

22:28.082 --> 22:30.414
Oh, my darling.

22:30.618 --> 22:33.018
Oh, you look wonderful.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.950
I'm so sorry about your hat.

22:36.157 --> 22:38.059
Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

22:38.159 --> 22:39.527
Is it really?

22:39.627 --> 22:42.427
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

22:42.512 --> 22:46.568
...but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

22:46.668 --> 22:49.738
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...

22:49.838 --> 22:52.140
...that they say what they please.

22:52.240 --> 22:57.412
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.

22:57.512 --> 23:01.112
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

23:07.512 --> 23:12.500
You are the love of my life.

23:18.501 --> 23:20.661
What manner of man is this?

23:21.404 --> 23:23.906
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

23:24.006 --> 23:26.909
...in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...

23:27.009 --> 23:29.879
...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

23:29.979 --> 23:34.313
...returns from business abroad in Transylvania...

23:34.517 --> 23:37.553
...promptly suffers a complete mental breakdown.

23:37.653 --> 23:40.885
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.

23:44.995 --> 23:46.995
George.

23:48.932 --> 23:50.932
Wait here.

23:58.108 --> 24:01.211
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

24:01.311 --> 24:03.939
...or a canapé?

24:04.147 --> 24:08.627
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

24:08.919 --> 24:11.489
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

24:11.589 --> 24:13.491
Is my personal life of interest to you?

24:13.591 --> 24:17.459
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

24:17.662 --> 24:20.598
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

24:20.698 --> 24:24.065
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

24:24.269 --> 24:27.033
You see,
each life that I ingest...

24:27.238 --> 24:29.399
...gives back life to me.

24:33.077 --> 24:35.875
A fly gives you life?

24:36.080 --> 24:37.883
Certainly.

24:37.983 --> 24:42.054
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

24:42.154 --> 24:44.957
...than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

24:45.057 --> 24:49.628
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

24:49.728 --> 24:53.960
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

24:55.568 --> 24:57.627
Yes, spiders eat them.

24:57.836 --> 25:00.134
What about sparrows?

25:00.339 --> 25:03.604
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

25:03.809 --> 25:07.940
Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

25:09.349 --> 25:11.408
A kitten.

25:11.618 --> 25:13.253
I beg you.

25:13.353 --> 25:16.254
A little, sleek... A playful kitten.

25:16.456 --> 25:19.896
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

25:19.961 --> 25:21.828
No one would refuse me a kitten.

25:21.928 --> 25:24.192
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

25:26.399 --> 25:28.101
Oh, yes.

25:28.201 --> 25:30.201
A big cat.

25:30.403 --> 25:33.406
My salvation depends upon it.
- Your salvation?

25:33.506 --> 25:35.507
Yes. I need lives.

25:35.676 --> 25:39.036
I need lives for the master.
- What master?

25:41.549 --> 25:43.983
The master will come...

25:45.119 --> 25:48.289
...and he has promised to make me immortal.

25:48.389 --> 25:50.389
How?

25:51.492 --> 25:53.492
Get him off.

25:54.629 --> 25:56.893
The blood is the life.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.058
The blood is the life.

26:01.836 --> 26:04.465
30th May, Castle Dracula.

26:04.673 --> 26:09.044
I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.

26:09.144 --> 26:10.546
The count...

26:10.646 --> 26:14.116
...the way he looked at Mina's picture fills me with dread...

26:14.216 --> 26:19.496
...as if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.

26:42.011 --> 26:44.091
I didn't hear you come in.

26:46.816 --> 26:49.842
Take care how you cut yourself.

26:50.053 --> 26:53.420
It is more dangerous than you think.

26:59.762 --> 27:04.757
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

27:04.968 --> 27:07.232
Perhaps you should...

27:07.438 --> 27:09.565
...grow a beard.

27:17.114 --> 27:19.912
The letters I requested.

27:20.117 --> 27:22.312
Have you written them?

27:38.903 --> 27:40.903
Good.

27:49.547 --> 27:52.880
Should you leave these rooms...

27:54.319 --> 27:56.588
...you will not, by any chance...

27:56.688 --> 28:00.449
...go to sleep in any other part of the castle.

28:01.694 --> 28:03.855
It is old...

28:05.097 --> 28:07.998
...and has many bad memories.

28:10.069 --> 28:13.664
Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

28:22.248 --> 28:26.242
Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceit.

28:27.988 --> 28:30.718
We are in Transylvania.

28:32.225 --> 28:35.752
Transylvania is not England.

28:35.962 --> 28:39.090
Our ways are not your ways.

28:39.299 --> 28:41.299
And to you...

28:41.468 --> 28:44.665
...there shall be many strange things.

28:44.871 --> 28:48.102
I've seen many strange things already.

28:48.308 --> 28:52.388
Bloody wolves chasing me through some blue inferno.

28:56.951 --> 28:59.715
Listen to them.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.094
The children of the night.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.396
What sweet music they make.

29:11.599 --> 29:14.591
Music? Those animals?

29:48.637 --> 29:52.972
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

29:53.176 --> 29:56.679
To the firm, to my family and to my beloved Mina.

29:56.779 --> 30:01.419
I said nothing of my fears as he will read them, no doubt.

30:05.088 --> 30:07.648
I know now that I am a prisoner.

31:33.012 --> 31:35.012
Jonathan.

31:36.015 --> 31:38.245
Jonathan, come to me.

31:47.995 --> 31:49.995
Come.

32:08.215 --> 32:10.215
Lay down.

32:11.318 --> 32:13.319
Lay back into my arms.

32:22.964 --> 32:25.296
Lay back, Jonathan.

34:16.804 --> 34:20.194
What's going on, you tricksters?!

34:26.324 --> 34:30.226
How dare you touch him.
He belongs to me.

34:30.829 --> 34:32.829
You yourself never loved.

34:35.967 --> 34:40.563
Yes. I too can love.

34:42.775 --> 34:46.768
And I shall love again.

34:55.321 --> 34:57.983
Are we to have nothing tonight?

35:42.237 --> 35:44.762
'Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

35:44.973 --> 35:47.876
The count has insisted I remain for a month...

35:47.976 --> 35:50.278
...to tutor him in English custom.

35:50.378 --> 35:53.711
I can say no more,
except I love you.

35:53.915 --> 35:56.611
Ever faithful, Jonathan. ”

36:00.021 --> 36:04.742
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

36:07.596 --> 36:11.433
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors who are loyal to the death...

36:11.533 --> 36:14.493
...to whatever nobleman they serve...

36:16.572 --> 36:20.276
...day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

36:20.376 --> 36:23.573
...from the bowels of the castle.

36:24.780 --> 36:30.381
They are to be delivered to his newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

36:31.321 --> 36:35.155
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?

36:40.363 --> 36:42.923
I love him. I love him.

36:46.136 --> 36:48.969
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

36:49.172 --> 36:51.606
I love him and I've said yes.

36:51.808 --> 36:55.312
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

36:55.412 --> 36:58.211
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

36:58.416 --> 37:02.318
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.323
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

37:05.423 --> 37:09.823
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.228
You don't seem to care.

37:13.431 --> 37:16.567
It's just that I'm so terribly worried about Jonathan.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.903
This letter I received is so...

37:19.003 --> 37:23.374
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

37:23.474 --> 37:25.474
Mina, don't worry.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.172
Captain's log: The Demeter.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.367
27th June, 1897.

37:59.479 --> 38:02.548
We picked up 50 boxes of experimental earth...

38:02.648 --> 38:04.968
...bound for London, England.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.287
Set sail at noon into a storm...

38:07.387 --> 38:09.956
...that seemed to come out of nowhere...

38:10.056 --> 38:12.422
...carrying us out to sea.

38:47.561 --> 38:51.122
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

38:51.331 --> 38:55.735
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

38:56.671 --> 38:59.504
Believe someone or something...

38:59.707 --> 39:02.267
...is aboard the ship with us.

39:14.989 --> 39:17.219
Master, I am here.

39:18.226 --> 39:21.196
The master of all life is at hand.

39:21.397 --> 39:23.397
Gather round.

39:23.482 --> 39:25.968
I am here to do your bidding, master.

39:26.068 --> 39:28.471
I have worshipped you long and far off.

39:28.571 --> 39:31.972
And now you are near, master.

39:32.174 --> 39:34.734
I am your slave.

39:34.944 --> 39:37.504
I await your command.

39:37.713 --> 39:40.516
The case of Renfield grows more interesting.

39:40.616 --> 39:44.487
Yet, there is method in his madness with his flies and spiders.

39:44.587 --> 39:47.823
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...

39:47.923 --> 39:51.724
...the key to the fancy of one lunatic...

39:58.134 --> 40:00.134
Lucy.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.995
Lucy? Lucy.

42:40.002 --> 42:44.063
No. Do not see me.

42:59.588 --> 43:02.648
Oh. I couldn't control myself.

43:02.858 --> 43:06.729
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

43:06.829 --> 43:10.789
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

43:11.001 --> 43:15.739
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

43:15.839 --> 43:17.307
I'm absolutely shaking.

43:17.407 --> 43:19.343
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

43:19.443 --> 43:22.746
I had to. It sort of pulled me and lured me.

43:22.846 --> 43:25.906
I had no control.
- It's all right.

43:26.116 --> 43:29.017
It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

43:29.219 --> 43:33.059
I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.

43:45.870 --> 43:48.634
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.641
Master.

43:53.444 --> 43:56.311
I am here to do your bidding.

43:57.115 --> 44:00.346
Master. I am here.

44:01.886 --> 44:04.116
I have worshipped you.

44:07.059 --> 44:09.962
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

44:10.062 --> 44:14.099
...like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

44:14.199 --> 44:19.079
...though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

44:35.121 --> 44:38.215
See the amazing cinematograph.

44:38.424 --> 44:41.359
A wonder of modern civilization.

44:41.561 --> 44:43.722
The latest sensation.

44:43.930 --> 44:47.050
The greatest attraction of the century.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.863
The new wonder of the world.

45:14.228 --> 45:16.228
See me.

45:17.998 --> 45:19.998
See me now.

45:25.973 --> 45:29.170
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large.

45:29.376 --> 45:31.377
Buy a paper, sir?

45:33.548 --> 45:35.548
Thank you, sir.

45:37.586 --> 45:41.078
Get your Gazette.
Penny a paper.

45:54.336 --> 45:56.827
My humblest apologies.

45:58.073 --> 46:00.941
Forgive my ignorance.

46:01.143 --> 46:04.112
I am recently arrived from abroad...

46:04.313 --> 46:07.282
...and I do not know your city.

46:07.483 --> 46:12.363
Is a beautiful lady...
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

46:14.290 --> 46:16.290
I have offended you.

46:17.760 --> 46:20.096
I am only looking for the cinematograph.

46:20.196 --> 46:23.733
I understand it is a wonder of the civilized world.

46:23.833 --> 46:27.496
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

46:27.703 --> 46:30.664
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

46:39.950 --> 46:42.653
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

46:42.753 --> 46:46.356
...should not be walking the streets of London without her gentleman.

46:46.456 --> 46:48.651
Do I know you, sir?

46:49.927 --> 46:52.760
Are you acquainted with my husband?

46:52.963 --> 46:54.963
Shall I call the police?

46:56.668 --> 46:58.795
Husband?

46:59.003 --> 47:01.403
I shall bother you no more.

47:05.176 --> 47:07.176
Sir.

47:07.946 --> 47:10.506
It is I who have been rude.

47:10.715 --> 47:13.479
If you're looking...
- Please.

47:15.853 --> 47:18.413
Permit me to introduce myself.

47:20.325 --> 47:24.523
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

47:27.566 --> 47:29.726
A prince, no less?
- I am...

47:31.170 --> 47:33.170
...your servant.

47:35.374 --> 47:37.934
Wilhelmina Murray.

47:40.946 --> 47:43.540
I am...

47:43.749 --> 47:45.749
...honored...

47:45.918 --> 47:47.918
...Madam Mina.

47:51.790 --> 47:53.791
This way.

48:06.806 --> 48:08.806
Hello, sir.

48:08.874 --> 48:12.178
Mr. Holmwood asked me to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

48:12.278 --> 48:13.780
Yes, sir.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.600
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

48:16.716 --> 48:18.351
Oh, Jack.

48:18.451 --> 48:21.648
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

48:23.491 --> 48:25.526
Did Arthur put you up to this...

48:25.626 --> 48:29.964
...or did you want me alone just once before I'm married?

48:30.064 --> 48:32.532
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

48:32.733 --> 48:35.395
I'm here as your doctor.

48:35.603 --> 48:37.838
Your fiancé is very worried about you...

48:37.938 --> 48:42.705
...and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

48:42.910 --> 48:45.470
I must have your complete trust.

48:49.683 --> 48:51.684
Help me, Jack.

48:53.021 --> 48:55.791
I don't know what's happening to me.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.916
I'm changing.

48:58.126 --> 49:00.126
I can feel it.

49:01.563 --> 49:03.563
I can hear everything.

49:03.631 --> 49:06.668
I hear the servants at the other end of the house, whispering.

49:06.768 --> 49:10.688
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

49:11.206 --> 49:14.486
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.

49:15.977 --> 49:17.579
The eyes.

49:17.679 --> 49:19.082
Oh, Jack.

49:19.182 --> 49:22.811
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

49:25.822 --> 49:27.822
Let it work.

49:29.258 --> 49:31.453
Thank you.
- Lucy.

49:31.661 --> 49:34.027
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

49:39.168 --> 49:42.105
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride...

49:42.205 --> 49:44.607
...riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.

49:44.707 --> 49:48.345
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.

49:48.445 --> 49:52.404
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

49:52.616 --> 49:56.279
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

49:56.487 --> 49:59.189
Jack, are you still brooding over Miss Lucy?

49:59.289 --> 50:02.860
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.327
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

50:06.530 --> 50:11.402
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

50:11.502 --> 50:13.502
Let's have a look at her.

50:23.681 --> 50:26.650
I'm at a loss, I admit.

50:26.851 --> 50:29.521
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

50:29.621 --> 50:31.623
...the metaphysician, philosopher.

50:31.723 --> 50:34.592
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

50:34.692 --> 50:38.563
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

50:38.663 --> 50:40.823
He's my teacher and mentor.

50:43.768 --> 50:47.205
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

50:47.406 --> 50:49.406
Spare no expense.

51:24.177 --> 51:25.912
Astounding.

51:26.012 --> 51:28.776
There are no limits to science.

51:31.051 --> 51:33.451
How can you call this science?

51:34.688 --> 51:37.724
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?

51:37.824 --> 51:39.824
Really.

51:43.397 --> 51:45.831
I shouldn't have come here.

51:46.033 --> 51:48.033
I must go.

51:53.207 --> 51:55.207
Do not fear me.

52:10.292 --> 52:11.994
Stop this.

52:12.094 --> 52:14.094
Stop this.

52:24.006 --> 52:26.566
My God. Who are you?

52:26.775 --> 52:28.510
I know you.

52:28.610 --> 52:33.104
I have crossed oceans of time...

52:33.315 --> 52:35.315
...to find you.

53:14.291 --> 53:16.371
There is no need to panic.

53:16.493 --> 53:21.213
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.

53:40.218 --> 53:42.218
Come here, Mina.

54:01.506 --> 54:03.507
He likes you.

54:29.335 --> 54:32.567
There is much to be learned from beasts.

55:45.781 --> 55:48.016
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

55:48.116 --> 55:52.855
...consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

55:52.955 --> 55:55.755
...or its own blood cells will die.

56:04.667 --> 56:06.667
Cute little vermin, ja?

56:07.737 --> 56:10.373
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

56:10.473 --> 56:13.753
...such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

56:14.344 --> 56:16.679
The very name 'venereal diseases'...

56:16.779 --> 56:20.483
...the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

56:20.583 --> 56:24.053
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

56:24.153 --> 56:28.259
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

56:28.359 --> 56:33.399
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

56:36.534 --> 56:39.303
What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

56:39.403 --> 56:41.403
Telegraph?

56:44.475 --> 56:48.395
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

56:58.557 --> 57:00.582
Dawn.

57:00.792 --> 57:03.695
These may be the last words I write in this journal.

57:03.795 --> 57:06.498
Dracula has left me with these women...

57:06.598 --> 57:08.758
...these devils of the pit.

57:08.829 --> 57:11.036
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

57:11.136 --> 57:13.936
...barely alive so I cannot escape.

57:14.021 --> 57:17.409
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

57:17.509 --> 57:20.412
There must be passageway to the river...

57:20.512 --> 57:22.982
...and then away from this cursed land...

57:23.082 --> 57:28.282
...where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

57:36.529 --> 57:38.698
For the record, I do attest...

57:38.798 --> 57:42.068
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

57:42.168 --> 57:46.488
...became personally involved in these strange events.

58:40.061 --> 58:43.741
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

58:47.669 --> 58:51.106
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

58:51.206 --> 58:53.676
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

58:53.776 --> 58:56.712
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

58:56.812 --> 59:00.015
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

59:00.115 --> 59:03.719
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

59:03.819 --> 59:05.819
Blood loss? How?

59:15.097 --> 59:17.098
My God, close the doors.

59:28.011 --> 59:29.145
My God...

59:29.245 --> 59:31.304
...she's only a child.

59:32.982 --> 59:34.982
Ja.

59:35.752 --> 59:37.752
My God.

59:37.854 --> 59:41.925
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

59:42.025 --> 59:44.694
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

59:44.794 --> 59:47.231
Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

59:47.331 --> 59:49.800
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

59:49.900 --> 59:51.900
Landsteiner's method.

59:53.637 --> 59:55.798
Animals, goats, sheeps.

59:57.508 --> 59:59.443
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...

59:59.543 --> 01:00:01.278
...her red blood cells will explode.

01:00:01.378 --> 01:00:03.676
She will die.
Take this tube.

01:00:07.685 --> 01:00:09.854
What in God's name is going on up here?

01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:11.856
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:14.426
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

01:00:14.526 --> 01:00:17.486
Good God.
- You're the fiancé? Please.

01:00:20.532 --> 01:00:23.635
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

01:00:23.735 --> 01:00:25.804
She wants blood and blood she must have.

01:00:25.904 --> 01:00:27.305
Take off your coat.

01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:29.405
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

01:00:30.675 --> 01:00:32.939
Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

01:00:33.145 --> 01:00:34.746
Roll it up.

01:00:34.846 --> 01:00:37.086
This may hurt a little, Art.

01:00:48.361 --> 01:00:51.931
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:54.031
Your last drop?

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:55.768
Thank you.

01:00:55.868 --> 01:01:00.306
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:02.406
Hold her hand.

01:01:14.388 --> 01:01:18.792
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:23.372
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

01:01:25.566 --> 01:01:29.886
What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

01:01:34.374 --> 01:01:36.343
Those marks on her throat...

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.879
...no disease, no trituration...

01:01:38.979 --> 01:01:40.882
...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

01:01:40.982 --> 01:01:43.142
Oh? Where did the blood go?

01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:46.788
You were once a careful student, Jack.

01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:48.790
Use your brain.
Where did the blood go?

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.890
Tell me.

01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:53.695
The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:56.264
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:58.700
...that which you cannot account for.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.920
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

01:02:04.339 --> 01:02:06.174
Ja. Why not?

01:02:06.274 --> 01:02:10.473
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

01:02:10.679 --> 01:02:12.848
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

01:02:12.948 --> 01:02:16.185
...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

01:02:16.285 --> 01:02:18.845
Jack, you are a scientist.

01:02:19.054 --> 01:02:22.458
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

01:02:22.558 --> 01:02:25.094
...and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:27.329
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:29.909
Materialization, astral bodies.

01:02:38.642 --> 01:02:40.642
Professor?

01:02:42.145 --> 01:02:44.145
Where did he go?

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.583
You see?

01:02:48.651 --> 01:02:51.054
I feel like a blundering novice.

01:02:51.154 --> 01:02:54.758
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.927
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...

01:02:57.027 --> 01:02:59.229
...by something unspeakable out there.

01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:00.564
Dead, but not dead.

01:03:00.664 --> 01:03:03.800
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.038
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

01:03:07.138 --> 01:03:09.538
It is a beast, a monster.

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:31.284
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

01:03:31.495 --> 01:03:34.733
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:37.153
I wish I were myself again...

01:03:37.302 --> 01:03:40.965
...the sensible Mina I always depended on.

01:03:47.479 --> 01:03:49.479
Absinthe...

01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:52.401
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.

01:03:53.986 --> 01:03:56.511
The green fairy...

01:03:56.722 --> 01:04:01.421
...who lives in the absinthe...

01:04:01.627 --> 01:04:03.627
...wants your soul.

01:04:06.432 --> 01:04:08.432
But...

01:04:09.068 --> 01:04:12.060
...you are safe with me.

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:29.083
Tell me, Prince...

01:04:29.288 --> 01:04:31.314
...tell me of your home.

01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:36.122
The most beautiful place...

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.330
...in all creation.

01:04:39.066 --> 01:04:42.900
Yes, it must be.

01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:50.737
A land beyond a great, vast forest...

01:04:53.447 --> 01:04:56.487
...surrounded by majestic mountains...

01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:59.952
...lush vineyards...

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:06.384
...and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

01:05:06.594 --> 01:05:09.074
...as to be found nowhere else.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.809
You've described my home...

01:05:20.909 --> 01:05:23.709
...as if you had seen it firsthand.

01:05:27.183 --> 01:05:30.209
It's your voice, perhaps.

01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:32.419
It's so familiar.

01:05:34.323 --> 01:05:36.323
It's like...

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.340
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

01:05:43.332 --> 01:05:45.892
...and it comforts me.

01:05:46.102 --> 01:05:49.062
When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.519
And what of the princess?

01:06:19.402 --> 01:06:20.971
Princess?

01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:23.391
There is always a princess...

01:06:25.143 --> 01:06:27.543
...with gowns flowing white.

01:06:31.782 --> 01:06:34.808
And her face.

01:06:35.019 --> 01:06:37.988
Oh, God...

01:06:38.189 --> 01:06:40.189
...her face...

01:06:43.828 --> 01:06:45.828
...is a river.

01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:52.869
The princess...

01:06:53.872 --> 01:06:57.712
...she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

01:06:58.744 --> 01:07:00.744
...and heartbreak.

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:06.917
There was a princess.

01:07:10.422 --> 01:07:12.422
Elisabeta.

01:07:15.027 --> 01:07:16.962
She was the most radiant woman...

01:07:17.062 --> 01:07:19.862
...in all the empires of the world.

01:07:26.673 --> 01:07:30.353
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:35.209
She leapt to her death...

01:07:35.415 --> 01:07:38.295
...into the river that you spoke of.

01:07:38.885 --> 01:07:41.786
In my mother's tongue...

01:07:43.289 --> 01:07:45.289
...it is called...

01:07:46.492 --> 01:07:48.517
...argesh.

01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:52.831
River princess.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.367
Dear Madam.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.403
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:37.343
...of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:41.874
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:45.515
...and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:48.786
...so that you may immediately be married.

01:09:48.886 --> 01:09:52.481
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:57.787
My sweet prince.

01:09:57.995 --> 01:10:00.589
Jonathan must never know of us.

01:10:11.642 --> 01:10:13.078
Dr. Van Helsing.

01:10:13.178 --> 01:10:16.382
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:19.718
How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

01:10:19.818 --> 01:10:22.121
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...

01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:24.301
...and your worry for him.

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:27.770
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

01:10:31.196 --> 01:10:33.832
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

01:10:33.932 --> 01:10:35.957
...and there are lights.

01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:39.004
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:41.185
...the light of all light.

01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:48.679
Go now.
See your friend.

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:12.136
You look different.

01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:15.399
You look positively radiant.

01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:17.111
You heard from Jonathan.

01:11:17.211 --> 01:11:19.338
Didn't you?
- Yes.

01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:23.015
He's safe.

01:11:23.217 --> 01:11:25.845
He's in a convent in Romania.

01:11:26.053 --> 01:11:29.420
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

01:11:29.623 --> 01:11:31.359
The good sisters are caring for him.

01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:35.987
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

01:11:36.197 --> 01:11:39.190
...but I won't go.

01:11:39.401 --> 01:11:41.596
I'm not going to leave you.

01:11:43.972 --> 01:11:46.372
You've got to go to him...

01:11:46.575 --> 01:11:49.135
...and you've got to love him...

01:11:49.244 --> 01:11:52.284
...and marry him right then and there.

01:11:52.714 --> 01:11:56.480
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

01:11:56.685 --> 01:11:58.925
It's my wedding gift to you.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:03.729
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.827
I'll be all right.

01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:10.989
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

01:12:25.982 --> 01:12:27.982
Jack, how is she?

01:12:46.703 --> 01:12:49.536
This is why I cannot breathe.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.740
Lucy, it's medicinal.

01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:54.144
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:57.314
It's garlic.
It's nothing but common garlic.

01:12:57.414 --> 01:13:00.774
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

01:13:00.846 --> 01:13:04.447
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

01:13:04.656 --> 01:13:07.456
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

01:13:07.692 --> 01:13:09.127
He said if you don't get better quick...

01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:13.867
...I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

01:13:15.233 --> 01:13:17.633
You're such a beast.

01:13:20.972 --> 01:13:22.972
Will you kiss me?

01:13:25.977 --> 01:13:28.377
Kiss me.

01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:39.789
That old coot.
- Get off me.

01:13:39.992 --> 01:13:43.359
Listen to me.
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

01:13:46.498 --> 01:13:48.498
You're at peace.

01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:52.433
Look. There. There.

01:13:56.108 --> 01:13:58.108
Nosferatu.

01:14:11.358 --> 01:14:13.994
'Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

01:14:14.094 --> 01:14:17.962
...of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

01:14:18.164 --> 01:14:20.467
How he impaled people and roasted them...

01:14:20.567 --> 01:14:22.202
...boiled their heads in a kettle...

01:14:22.302 --> 01:14:24.638
...how he skinned them alive...

01:14:24.738 --> 01:14:29.299
...and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood.'

01:14:32.747 --> 01:14:34.977
Dracul.

01:14:35.182 --> 01:14:37.673
For blood is the life.

01:14:52.533 --> 01:14:56.766
'My dearest Prince, forgive me.

01:14:56.972 --> 01:15:00.576
I have received word from my fiancé in Romania.

01:15:00.676 --> 01:15:04.436
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.371
I will never see you again.

01:15:07.582 --> 01:15:09.582
Mina. ”

01:15:19.027 --> 01:15:21.427
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

01:15:21.495 --> 01:15:24.132
...that my strange friend is with me.

01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:27.031
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:30.340
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.376
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

01:15:33.476 --> 01:15:36.138
...I feel confused and lost.

01:15:36.345 --> 01:15:40.304
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

01:15:40.516 --> 01:15:43.451
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

01:16:01.672 --> 01:16:03.902
Winds.

01:16:14.885 --> 01:16:16.978
It is the cause.

01:16:17.187 --> 01:16:19.815
It is the cause of my soul.

01:16:20.023 --> 01:16:21.458
It is Dracula...

01:16:21.558 --> 01:16:23.618
...the undead...

01:16:23.828 --> 01:16:26.868
...the foe I have pursued all my life.

01:16:30.835 --> 01:16:32.835
Dracula.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.420
Jack, hurry.
I have much to tell you.

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:42.447
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

01:16:42.547 --> 01:16:44.913
Do not fail here tonight.

01:16:45.116 --> 01:16:48.119
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...

01:16:48.219 --> 01:16:50.288
...an enormous power,
so guard her well.

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:54.060
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.160
...a whore of darkness.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.110
You're a sick old buzzard.

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:03.133
Hear me out, young man.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.671
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:07.406
Do you understand? No.

01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:11.677
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:14.257
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

01:17:14.446 --> 01:17:16.880
She is the devil's concubine.

01:17:18.684 --> 01:17:20.685
Do you understand me?

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:24.785
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

01:17:24.991 --> 01:17:28.620
But not on an empty stomach.

01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:30.990
Jack.
- Here, sir.

01:17:31.198 --> 01:17:33.894
I starve. Feed me.

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:37.001
You old coot.

01:19:51.543 --> 01:19:54.813
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

01:19:54.913 --> 01:19:58.974
...cannot protect you from my power.

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.866
I condemn you to living death...

01:20:15.067 --> 01:20:18.161
...to eternal hunger...

01:20:18.371 --> 01:20:22.603
...for living blood.

01:21:56.171 --> 01:22:00.209
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

01:22:00.309 --> 01:22:02.402
Believe?
How can I believe?

01:22:02.611 --> 01:22:06.383
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

01:22:06.483 --> 01:22:08.483
An autopsy? Lucy?

01:22:08.651 --> 01:22:14.411
No, not exactly. I just want to cut
off her head and take out her heart.

01:22:20.196 --> 01:22:23.029
Diary, 17th September.

01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:26.794
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

01:22:27.003 --> 01:22:30.306
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

01:22:30.406 --> 01:22:34.647
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:38.315
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

01:22:38.415 --> 01:22:41.252
...except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

01:22:41.352 --> 01:22:43.888
...that I will again see my prince.

01:22:43.988 --> 01:22:45.988
Is he here?

01:22:46.056 --> 01:22:47.591
Now that I am married...

01:22:47.691 --> 01:22:51.829
...I begin to understand the nature of
my feelings for my strange friend...

01:22:51.929 --> 01:22:54.489
...who is always in my thoughts.

01:23:05.377 --> 01:23:07.402
Jonathan, what is it?

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:09.612
It is the man himself.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.775
Look, he's grown young.

01:23:55.394 --> 01:23:59.832
Gentlemen, must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

01:24:00.033 --> 01:24:02.033
She died horribly enough.

01:24:04.638 --> 01:24:07.741
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:10.332
But if she's not dead...

01:24:10.544 --> 01:24:13.013
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:18.073
No. All I say is she is undead.

01:24:19.086 --> 01:24:20.487
Undead.

01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:22.587
This is insane.

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:43.770
Gentlemen, shall we?

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.913
One, two, three.

01:25:03.799 --> 01:25:05.799
Where is she?

01:25:10.139 --> 01:25:13.040
What have you done with her?

01:25:13.242 --> 01:25:15.411
She lives beyond the grace of God...

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.746
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:21.714
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:24.921
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

01:25:25.021 --> 01:25:27.424
...but instead grow strong and become immortal...

01:25:27.524 --> 01:25:30.564
...once infected by another nosferatu.

01:25:35.265 --> 01:25:38.101
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:41.638
...but legions that go on age after age after age...

01:25:41.738 --> 01:25:44.778
...feeding on the blood of the living.

01:25:49.579 --> 01:25:52.447
Quickly, hide. Now.

01:26:29.454 --> 01:26:32.548
Come to me, Arthur.

01:26:32.758 --> 01:26:35.784
Leave these others and come to me.

01:26:37.796 --> 01:26:40.836
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

01:26:40.999 --> 01:26:44.491
Kiss me and caress me...

01:26:44.703 --> 01:26:47.103
...my darling husband, please.

01:26:47.188 --> 01:26:49.909
We wave Christ and His holy blood.

01:26:49.985 --> 01:26:54.225
We are strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

01:26:57.183 --> 01:26:59.423
The power of God is upon us.

01:27:11.164 --> 01:27:13.964
I bring you from shadow into light.

01:27:14.015 --> 01:27:17.215
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

01:27:17.236 --> 01:27:19.236
...into hell.

01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:23.877
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

01:27:23.977 --> 01:27:26.777
Take the stake in your left hand...

01:27:28.081 --> 01:27:30.801
...place the point over the heart.

01:27:34.621 --> 01:27:37.581
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now.

01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:57.701
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

01:28:00.882 --> 01:28:03.407
Doctor?
- Ja?

01:28:03.618 --> 01:28:05.618
How did Lucy die?

01:28:08.389 --> 01:28:10.389
Well...

01:28:11.359 --> 01:28:12.961
Was she in great pain?

01:28:13.061 --> 01:28:15.765
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:19.101
...drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

01:28:19.201 --> 01:28:22.466
Doctor. Please.

01:28:26.008 --> 01:28:28.169
So, Mr. Harker...

01:28:28.377 --> 01:28:31.497
...I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:35.951
...a sensitive question.

01:28:36.051 --> 01:28:38.621
During your infidelity with those creatures...

01:28:38.721 --> 01:28:40.289
...those demonic women...

01:28:40.389 --> 01:28:44.310
...did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:56.640
Good.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.309
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...

01:28:59.409 --> 01:29:02.289
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

01:29:10.353 --> 01:29:12.914
Doctor, you must understand.

01:29:14.659 --> 01:29:17.025
I doubted everything...

01:29:17.228 --> 01:29:18.896
...even my mind.

01:29:18.996 --> 01:29:20.996
I was impotent with fear.

01:29:21.198 --> 01:29:23.928
I know.
- But, sir...

01:29:24.135 --> 01:29:27.866
...I know where the bastard sleeps.

01:29:28.072 --> 01:29:31.701
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

01:29:34.478 --> 01:29:38.073
Vampires do exist.

01:29:38.282 --> 01:29:41.420
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.089
...has the strength of 20 or more people...

01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:46.258
...and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

01:29:46.358 --> 01:29:49.495
But he can also control the meaner things of life...

01:29:49.595 --> 01:29:51.697
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

01:29:51.797 --> 01:29:56.437
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

01:29:56.568 --> 01:29:58.637
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

01:29:58.737 --> 01:30:00.439
...but he is not free.

01:30:00.539 --> 01:30:03.942
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

01:30:04.042 --> 01:30:07.946
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

01:30:08.046 --> 01:30:11.084
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

01:30:11.184 --> 01:30:13.824
How can you pity such a creature?

01:30:15.188 --> 01:30:16.623
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

01:30:16.723 --> 01:30:19.123
Good. You'll be safer there.

01:30:21.861 --> 01:30:24.230
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:27.734
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

01:30:27.834 --> 01:30:31.914
Well, I wasn't planning on getting that close, Doc.

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:33.993
Master.

01:30:50.324 --> 01:30:52.485
Dr. Jack.

01:30:52.693 --> 01:30:55.560
I've been promised eternal life.

01:30:58.265 --> 01:31:00.505
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

01:31:00.701 --> 01:31:03.270
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:06.465
Renfield? I must see him.

01:31:07.676 --> 01:31:11.077
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:15.515
This is Mrs. Harker.

01:31:17.185 --> 01:31:20.916
Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

01:31:21.122 --> 01:31:23.842
It seems I've been rather naughty.

01:31:26.294 --> 01:31:28.294
I know you.

01:31:28.362 --> 01:31:31.082
You're the bride my master covets.

01:31:32.801 --> 01:31:35.430
I have a husband.

01:31:35.638 --> 01:31:37.638
I am Mrs. Harker.

01:31:38.507 --> 01:31:41.305
My master tells me about you.

01:31:42.478 --> 01:31:44.478
What does he tell you?

01:31:44.914 --> 01:31:46.914
That he is coming.

01:31:48.217 --> 01:31:50.297
That he is coming for you.

01:31:51.353 --> 01:31:53.353
Oh, please.

01:31:59.495 --> 01:32:01.495
Don't stay here.

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:06.494
Get away from these men, please.

01:32:07.904 --> 01:32:12.384
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

01:32:15.479 --> 01:32:18.359
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

01:32:29.326 --> 01:32:32.990
Master. Master.

01:32:33.197 --> 01:32:35.791
You promised me eternal life...

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.420
...but you give it to the pretty woman.

01:32:39.537 --> 01:32:41.537
Dr. Jack.

01:32:41.706 --> 01:32:43.706
I'm no lunatic man.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:46.768
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul.

01:32:46.878 --> 01:32:50.815
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

01:32:50.915 --> 01:32:52.915
Dr. Jack.

01:32:52.966 --> 01:32:56.006
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

01:32:58.022 --> 01:33:00.503
You'll be completely safe here.

01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:06.190
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

01:34:06.293 --> 01:34:08.293
Leave him no refuge.

01:34:08.529 --> 01:34:10.759
Let the exorcism begin.

01:34:40.195 --> 01:34:43.187
You have betrayed me.

01:34:47.202 --> 01:34:49.202
No, master.

01:34:53.376 --> 01:34:55.606
I serve you.

01:34:55.811 --> 01:34:58.644
I serve only you.

01:35:56.107 --> 01:35:59.201
Oh, yes, my love.

01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:01.776
You've found me.

01:36:05.016 --> 01:36:07.382
My most precious life.

01:36:07.585 --> 01:36:10.611
I have wanted this to happen.

01:36:10.822 --> 01:36:12.822
I know that now.

01:36:14.559 --> 01:36:17.995
I want to be with you always.

01:36:18.196 --> 01:36:22.691
You cannot know what you are saying.

01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:24.901
Yes...

01:36:25.037 --> 01:36:27.096
...I do know.

01:36:40.019 --> 01:36:44.012
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

01:36:44.223 --> 01:36:46.223
I thought you were dead.

01:36:53.299 --> 01:36:57.326
There is no life in this body.

01:37:01.508 --> 01:37:03.508
But you live.

01:37:05.178 --> 01:37:07.178
You live.

01:37:08.782 --> 01:37:10.782
What are you?

01:37:12.018 --> 01:37:15.112
I must know.
You must tell me.

01:37:22.463 --> 01:37:24.463
I am...

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.064
...nothing.

01:37:28.269 --> 01:37:30.269
Lifeless.

01:37:31.639 --> 01:37:33.774
Soulless.
- What do you mean?

01:37:33.874 --> 01:37:36.741
Hated and feared.

01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:40.913
I am dead to all the world.

01:37:41.115 --> 01:37:43.115
Hear me.

01:37:44.986 --> 01:37:47.011
I am the monster...

01:37:47.222 --> 01:37:49.862
...that breathing men would kill.

01:37:50.659 --> 01:37:53.219
I am Dracula.

01:38:09.044 --> 01:38:11.171
You murdered Lucy.

01:38:24.393 --> 01:38:26.393
I love you.

01:38:27.663 --> 01:38:32.032
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

01:38:50.654 --> 01:38:53.248
I want to be what you are...

01:38:53.457 --> 01:38:54.858
...see what you see...

01:38:54.958 --> 01:38:56.958
...love what you love.

01:39:00.497 --> 01:39:02.988
To walk with me...

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.480
...you must die to your breathing life...

01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:09.665
...and be reborn to mine.

01:39:09.874 --> 01:39:13.037
You are my love...

01:39:13.244 --> 01:39:15.838
...and my life always.

01:39:23.855 --> 01:39:25.657
Then...

01:39:25.757 --> 01:39:28.123
...I give you life eternal...

01:39:29.928 --> 01:39:31.928
...everlasting love...

01:39:33.498 --> 01:39:37.264
...the power of the storm...

01:39:37.468 --> 01:39:41.064
...and the beasts of the earth.

01:39:41.273 --> 01:39:43.400
Walk with me...

01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:47.272
...to be my loving wife forever.

01:39:47.479 --> 01:39:50.209
I will. Yes. Yes.

01:40:21.314 --> 01:40:24.215
Drink and join me...

01:40:25.318 --> 01:40:27.752
...in eternal life.

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:45.037
I cannot let this be.

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.405
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:53.714
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.616
...for all eternity.

01:40:55.716 --> 01:41:00.415
I love you too much...

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:02.089
...to condemn you.

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:07.287
Then take me away from all this death.

01:42:04.588 --> 01:42:07.853
You think you can destroy me...

01:42:08.058 --> 01:42:10.356
...with your idols?

01:42:13.364 --> 01:42:15.958
Sacred blood of Christ.

01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:19.033
I, who served the cross.

01:42:19.236 --> 01:42:21.534
I, who commanded nations...

01:42:21.739 --> 01:42:24.808
...hundreds of years before you were born.

01:42:24.908 --> 01:42:26.988
Your armies were defeated.

01:42:27.083 --> 01:42:30.946
You tortured and impaled thousands of people.

01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:34.243
I was betrayed.

01:42:34.452 --> 01:42:37.353
Look what your God...

01:42:37.555 --> 01:42:40.251
...has done to me.

01:42:40.458 --> 01:42:45.178
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.235
Christ compels you.

01:42:50.335 --> 01:42:53.793
She is now...

01:42:54.005 --> 01:42:57.237
...my bride.

01:43:01.947 --> 01:43:03.947
More light.

01:43:05.017 --> 01:43:08.316
Light. More light.

01:43:16.028 --> 01:43:18.028
Unclean.

01:43:20.399 --> 01:43:21.567
Get them.
- This way.

01:43:21.667 --> 01:43:23.235
Get them.
- They must be found.

01:43:23.335 --> 01:43:24.403
Unclean.

01:43:24.503 --> 01:43:26.984
We have learned something much.

01:43:27.062 --> 01:43:30.737
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

01:43:30.944 --> 01:43:34.004
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

01:43:34.214 --> 01:43:36.910
He is gone.

01:43:37.117 --> 01:43:39.347
How do you know?

01:43:39.553 --> 01:43:42.283
He speaks to me.

01:43:43.423 --> 01:43:46.543
He has a strong mind connection to you.

01:43:47.961 --> 01:43:51.881
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

01:43:52.165 --> 01:43:55.226
You admire him.
- Ja.

01:43:55.436 --> 01:43:59.668
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

01:43:59.874 --> 01:44:02.643
...and his mind was great and powerful...

01:44:02.743 --> 01:44:05.747
...but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

01:44:05.847 --> 01:44:08.007
...and destroy him utterly.

01:44:08.883 --> 01:44:10.883
Doctor?
- Ja?

01:44:13.855 --> 01:44:17.484
I know that I am becoming like him.

01:44:17.692 --> 01:44:21.059
Your salvation is his destruction.

01:44:21.262 --> 01:44:24.926
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

01:44:25.133 --> 01:44:29.171
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:32.729
Please, help me find him.
Please.

01:44:32.941 --> 01:44:35.273
Look into this light...

01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:38.837
...the light of all light,
into this flame.

01:44:39.248 --> 01:44:41.248
Your eyes are heavy.

01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:45.513
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

01:44:48.557 --> 01:44:52.324
Sleep.
- I must go to him.

01:44:52.529 --> 01:44:54.827
He calls.

01:44:55.031 --> 01:44:57.031
What do you hear?

01:44:58.768 --> 01:45:01.168
What do you hear, child?

01:45:02.272 --> 01:45:04.866
What do you hear?

01:45:05.074 --> 01:45:09.101
Oh, my prince is calling me.

01:45:09.312 --> 01:45:13.806
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

01:45:14.017 --> 01:45:17.077
There he will grow strong again.

01:45:17.287 --> 01:45:20.968
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:31.335
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

01:45:31.435 --> 01:45:34.538
...no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

01:45:34.638 --> 01:45:39.007
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

01:45:39.209 --> 01:45:42.880
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:46.340
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:50.255
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

01:45:50.355 --> 01:45:52.991
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...

01:45:53.091 --> 01:45:54.893
...where we have posted a lookout...

01:45:54.993 --> 01:45:57.829
...and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

01:45:57.929 --> 01:46:02.409
...where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

01:46:07.305 --> 01:46:10.399
Home. Home.

01:46:20.219 --> 01:46:22.989
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

01:46:23.089 --> 01:46:25.224
...and her blood is dying,
my friend.

01:46:25.324 --> 01:46:27.324
It is no use.

01:46:39.639 --> 01:46:42.942
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

01:46:43.042 --> 01:46:47.241
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

01:46:47.447 --> 01:46:50.109
Oh, what have I done to you?

01:46:51.852 --> 01:46:54.980
No, I have done this to both of us.

01:46:55.188 --> 01:46:57.457
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

01:46:57.557 --> 01:46:59.557
He's calling me to him.

01:47:04.231 --> 01:47:06.597
Stay with me. Please.

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.800
I am so cold.

01:47:21.015 --> 01:47:22.450
All aboard.

01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:26.287
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

01:47:26.387 --> 01:47:29.457
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...

01:47:29.557 --> 01:47:31.459
...to the northern port of Galatz.

01:47:31.559 --> 01:47:34.687
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

01:47:34.896 --> 01:47:37.364
How can we catch him now?

01:47:45.374 --> 01:47:47.774
Varna. Galatz.

01:47:47.976 --> 01:47:49.678
It's about 200 miles.

01:47:49.778 --> 01:47:52.014
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

01:47:52.114 --> 01:47:54.049
...reach him before he reaches the castle.

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:57.186
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

01:47:57.286 --> 01:47:58.854
If we fail in our task...

01:47:58.954 --> 01:48:01.434
...you will have to finish him.

01:48:05.728 --> 01:48:09.064
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

01:48:09.164 --> 01:48:11.935
...and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

01:48:12.035 --> 01:48:15.905
...where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

01:48:16.005 --> 01:48:20.704
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:35.025
I know this place.

01:48:35.125 --> 01:48:37.894
The end of the world.
- We must go on.

01:48:37.994 --> 01:48:39.897
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

01:48:39.997 --> 01:48:42.431
No, we must go.

01:48:42.633 --> 01:48:44.633
He needs me.
We must go.

01:48:48.773 --> 01:48:50.773
We have passed Bistritza.

01:48:50.841 --> 01:48:53.436
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

01:48:53.644 --> 01:48:57.448
We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...

01:48:57.548 --> 01:49:01.075
...and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

01:49:17.035 --> 01:49:20.471
Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

01:50:12.693 --> 01:50:15.733
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

01:50:25.272 --> 01:50:29.192
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

01:50:29.309 --> 01:50:31.641
She told me.

01:50:31.845 --> 01:50:34.838
I, too, know what men desire.

01:50:51.532 --> 01:50:53.468
Will you cut off my head...

01:50:53.568 --> 01:50:55.537
...and drive a stake through my heart...

01:50:55.637 --> 01:50:59.317
...as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

01:51:03.078 --> 01:51:06.518
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

01:51:23.299 --> 01:51:25.779
You are safe within the circle.

01:51:25.901 --> 01:51:29.359
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:31.572
You're whores of Satan.

01:51:35.178 --> 01:51:37.178
This is holy ground.

01:51:37.314 --> 01:51:39.314
Leave this place now.

01:51:41.151 --> 01:51:43.151
Leave.

01:51:43.853 --> 01:51:46.656
In the name of God,
leave this ground.

01:51:46.756 --> 01:51:49.636
I command you in the name of Christ.

01:52:00.705 --> 01:52:03.606
Christ. Damn you.

01:52:40.779 --> 01:52:42.779
Dracul.

01:53:21.487 --> 01:53:23.487
You are...

01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:25.954
...near.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:28.160
My love.

01:53:40.174 --> 01:53:41.608
They're racing against the sunset.

01:53:41.708 --> 01:53:44.188
It may be too late.
God help us.

01:54:25.121 --> 01:54:27.121
Harker, shoot.

01:54:35.264 --> 01:54:37.264
Charge.

01:57:18.633 --> 01:57:22.313
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

01:57:24.439 --> 01:57:26.439
Will you?

01:57:32.013 --> 01:57:33.515
Wait.
- Let them go.

01:57:33.615 --> 01:57:37.415
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

01:57:38.219 --> 01:57:40.220
Hers has just begun.

01:58:04.046 --> 01:58:06.742
We've all become God's madmen.

01:58:09.252 --> 01:58:11.252
All of us.

01:58:20.464 --> 01:58:24.195
Where is my God?

01:58:24.401 --> 01:58:27.564
He has forsaken me.

01:58:33.844 --> 01:58:37.076
It is finished.

01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:41.150
My love.

01:58:45.423 --> 01:58:47.423
My love.

01:58:55.099 --> 01:58:57.659
There, in the presence of God...

01:58:57.731 --> 01:59:00.672
...I understood at last how my love could release us all...

01:59:00.772 --> 01:59:03.252
...from the powers of darkness.

01:59:08.981 --> 01:59:11.541
Our love is stronger than death.

01:59:19.792 --> 01:59:22.659
Give me peace.
