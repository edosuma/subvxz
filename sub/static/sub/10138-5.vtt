07:24.152 --> 07:26.738
Kids, that was not

07:24.152 --> 07:26.738
supposed to be funny.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.365
Well, I guess, I'll just

07:26.780 --> 07:28.365
head back to my office

07:28.407 --> 07:29.657
and take

07:28.407 --> 07:29.657
another quick look

07:29.699 --> 07:31.410
at your teaching

07:29.699 --> 07:31.410
certificate.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.415
Okay, kids, now,

07:34.246 --> 07:36.415
let's get down

07:36.456 --> 07:38.166
to the business of learning,

07:36.456 --> 07:38.166
shall we?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.751
[laughing]

07:39.793 --> 07:42.796
That's funny. Joey's pretending

07:39.793 --> 07:42.796
to be serious.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.672
[laughing]

07:44.714 --> 07:46.383
Hey, come on,

07:44.714 --> 07:46.383
I<i> am</i> being serious.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.884
We've got a lot of ground

07:46.425 --> 07:47.884
to cover today.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.387
So let's start by opening

07:47.926 --> 07:50.387
our science books

07:50.429 --> 07:51.805
to chapter four.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.223
[imitating Bullwinkle]

07:51.846 --> 07:53.223
Hey, rock, watch me pull

07:53.265 --> 07:55.016
chapter four

07:53.265 --> 07:55.016
out of my hat.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.811
[laughing]

07:57.852 --> 07:59.980
Come on, let's all

07:57.852 --> 07:59.980
calm down now, okay?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.316
Hey, Joey, do Porky Pig.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.568
Uh...Michelle..

08:05.610 --> 08:06.778
...uh, first off

08:06.820 --> 08:09.156
at school,

08:06.820 --> 08:09.156
it's Mr. Gladstone.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.366
And I'm not doing

08:09.197 --> 08:11.366
Porky Pig.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.160
Porky! Porky!

08:13.201 --> 08:14.828
(all)

08:13.201 --> 08:14.828
Porky, Porky!

08:14.869 --> 08:15.787
That's enough.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.290
(all)

08:15.829 --> 08:18.290
Porky, Porky!

08:18.332 --> 08:19.707
Alright.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.707
Let's all settle down.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.917
'Time out, okay?'

08:20.959 --> 08:23.003
(all)

08:20.959 --> 08:23.003
Porky!

08:23.044 --> 08:24.796
Alright!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.631
Alright, that's it!

08:26.673 --> 08:28.258
Now, the next person

08:26.673 --> 08:28.258
who makes even one little peep

08:28.300 --> 08:30.718
is going straight

08:28.300 --> 08:30.718
to the principal's office.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.595
Come on, Joey.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.595
Lighten up.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.306
[all gasp]

08:36.766 --> 08:37.976
Michelle?

08:38.018 --> 08:41.104
- What? I didn't peep.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.104
- Don't worry.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.815
I'm sure it was just

08:41.146 --> 08:43.815
an empty threat.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.404
Now, Michelle,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.404
you heard me.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.822
And I'm afraid, I'm gonna

08:49.446 --> 08:50.822
have to send you

08:50.864 --> 08:53.158
straight down

08:50.864 --> 08:53.158
to Mrs. Homewood's office.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.785
- Me?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.785
- Yes, you. Now!

08:58.746 --> 09:01.124
Thanks a lot,

08:58.746 --> 09:01.124
Mr. Gladstone.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.377
I thought

09:01.166 --> 09:03.377
you were my friend.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.963

09:28.235 --> 09:31.863
Comet...that's very rude.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.863

[dog whining]

09:33.865 --> 09:36.034
[music continues]

09:37.494 --> 09:39.538
Joey, why the sad face?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.538
What happened?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.748
One of the big kids

09:39.579 --> 09:41.748
take your milk money?

09:41.789 --> 09:44.125
Well, yeah.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.626
But I'm over that.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.214
I gotta be the world's

<i>worst</i> substitute teacher.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.340
[door slams]

09:50.382 --> 09:52.467
I'm sure

09:50.382 --> 09:52.467
you're not the worst.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.844
Do<i> I</i> get a vote?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.263
Michelle, that's not

09:54.886 --> 09:56.263
very nice.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.474
He sent me

09:56.304 --> 09:59.474
to the principal's office!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.642
Joey, that's not

09:59.516 --> 10:01.642
very nice.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.353
Danny, the whole class

10:01.684 --> 10:03.353
was out of control

10:03.395 --> 10:04.938
and I said,

10:03.395 --> 10:04.938
"the next person who talks

10:04.979 --> 10:06.814
goes straight

10:04.979 --> 10:06.814
to the principal's office."

10:06.856 --> 10:09.943
And the next person

10:06.856 --> 10:09.943
happened to be Michelle.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.152
Is that true?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.695
Well, part of it.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
Which part?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.657
The part Joey said.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.867
Well, if that's the case

10:17.909 --> 10:19.453
I think, maybe Joey

10:17.909 --> 10:19.453
did the right thing.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.661
You gotta go upstairs

10:19.494 --> 10:20.661
in your room

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
and think about it

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
for a while.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.665
Boy, you give a guy

10:22.456 --> 10:24.665
a tie and a book

10:24.707 --> 10:26.501
with the answers in the back

10:26.543 --> 10:29.087
and he forgets

10:26.543 --> 10:29.087
who his friends are.

10:36.761 --> 10:41.057
Wow! How do you divide ten

10:36.761 --> 10:41.057
hot-looking guys by three girls?

10:41.099 --> 10:44.519
Simple, five for D.J.,

10:41.099 --> 10:44.519
five for me

10:44.561 --> 10:47.522
and zippola

10:44.561 --> 10:47.522
for little Miss Get Real.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.858
This is amazing!

10:50.900 --> 10:53.194
Uncle Jesse puts an ad

10:50.900 --> 10:53.194
in the paper for<i> one</i> day

10:53.236 --> 10:55.530
and this place

10:53.236 --> 10:55.530
is packed!

10:55.572 --> 10:58.241
So how come, I run

10:55.572 --> 10:58.241
a personal ad for a month

10:58.283 --> 11:00.660
and don't get

10:58.283 --> 11:00.660
a single response?

11:00.701 --> 11:02.912
Next time,

11:00.701 --> 11:02.912
leave your picture out.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.500
Alright.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.500
There you go.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.336
Okay, guys,

11:06.541 --> 11:09.336
who wants ice cream?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.340
Let me rephrase that.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.092
Who wants ice cream,

11:13.381 --> 11:16.092
but can't read yet?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.097
Alright.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.097
How about this?

11:21.139 --> 11:24.058
Wants ice cream,

11:21.139 --> 11:24.058
can't read, no tattoos?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.604
We have two winners!

11:27.646 --> 11:29.564
- Yay!

11:29.606 --> 11:31.065
Alright! Let's get

11:29.606 --> 11:31.065
some ice cream.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.193
What kind do you want,

11:31.107 --> 11:33.193
chocolate or vanilla?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.282
for my audition yet?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.075
Dad, I told you before,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.075
Uncle Jesse said

11:41.117 --> 11:42.452
"5 o'clock, no earlier."

11:42.494 --> 11:43.662
I know, I know,

11:42.494 --> 11:43.662
I just thought, maybe

11:43.702 --> 11:46.122
there'd be

11:43.702 --> 11:46.122
some cancellations..

11:46.164 --> 11:47.457
...or arrests.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.751

11:48.500 --> 11:50.751
Alright, thanks, pal.

Alright, who's next?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.421
Um, first up is Crash

11:53.463 --> 11:56.466
then Scuzz, then Scab.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.926
Scuzz, Scab.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.637
Maybe-maybe I need

11:58.968 --> 12:00.637
a tough rock 'n' roll name

12:00.679 --> 12:02.055
like that, huh?

12:02.096 --> 12:05.475
Oh, hey, I got a great one.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.475
How about, Soap Scum?

12:05.517 --> 12:08.353
No, I don't think

12:05.517 --> 12:08.353
that's too tough.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.937
How about, Mildew?

12:11.189 --> 12:13.149
Ooh, that's vicious!

12:16.653 --> 12:19.197
[music from guitar]

12:19.239 --> 12:21.074

have a nice day.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.088
What?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.676
Thank you. Right up,

12:37.716 --> 12:39.676
right up the stairs.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.761
Okay.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.761
Don't call us.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.682
How come, there's never a power

12:42.803 --> 12:45.682

12:45.724 --> 12:46.974
Honey, they've all been bad

12:47.016 --> 12:50.604
but<i> nobody</i> could be worse

12:47.016 --> 12:50.604
than Splinter.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.939
Here's Mildew!

12:55.066 --> 12:56.359
You were saying?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.736
Alright, Danny, uh

12:57.776 --> 12:59.362
plug it into the amp,

12:57.776 --> 12:59.362
turn it down a little bit.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.741
And you got 15 seconds,

12:59.404 --> 13:02.741
starting...now.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.076
Okay, I've been-I've been

13:02.781 --> 13:05.076
practicing really hard.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.578
Here-here goes nothing.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.997
[music from guitar]

13:26.264 --> 13:28.558
Danny, that was killer!

13:28.600 --> 13:30.393
All these years

13:28.600 --> 13:30.393
working with you

13:30.435 --> 13:32.604
Who knew you actually

13:30.435 --> 13:32.604
had talent!

13:33.980 --> 13:36.441
I mean, on the guitar?

13:36.483 --> 13:37.734
So you're saying,

13:36.483 --> 13:37.734
I'm a lot hotter

13:37.776 --> 13:40.069
and hipper than you

13:37.776 --> 13:40.069
thought I was?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.738
A little.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.574
And, uh, how about you,

13:41.780 --> 13:44.574
how about you,<i> brotha man?</i>

13:44.616 --> 13:46.033
What do you think?

13:46.075 --> 13:49.120
Well, uh,<i> brotha</i> man,

13:46.075 --> 13:49.120
you were, uh...very good.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.665
It's-it's, it was-it was good.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.583
Listen, let me, uh,

13:51.706 --> 13:53.583
let me, just go over

13:53.625 --> 13:55.543
a few of the notes here

13:53.625 --> 13:55.543
and some of the other players

13:55.585 --> 13:56.544
and-and we'll get back to you.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.005
You just, you take your time.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.881
Mildew's gonna chill.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.384
Jess, you gotta admit it.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.761
Danny's the best one

14:03.426 --> 14:04.761
you've seen today.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.220
I know, I hate to admit it.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.348
You're right, he is the best one

14:06.262 --> 14:08.348
we've seen today.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.057
But the thought

14:08.389 --> 14:10.057
of Danny Tanner in my band.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.518
It just doesn't jive.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.478
You know, he just, he doesn't

14:11.559 --> 14:13.478
have the right image.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.689
You know, he's-he's,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.689
he's just not rock 'n' roll.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.190
He's more..

14:19.150 --> 14:20.860
...spic 'n' span.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.446
I know, but if you're

14:22.028 --> 14:23.446
gonna be fair

14:23.488 --> 14:25.323
you have to give

14:23.488 --> 14:25.323
the job to Danny.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.201
I don't wanna be fair.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.201
I wanna be cool.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.661
Wait, there's one more.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.995
Thanks, D.J..

14:31.830 --> 14:33.748
You remembered my name!

14:33.790 --> 14:36.751
Yeah, it's a great name.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.085
You think so?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.420
It's only

14:38.127 --> 14:39.420
two letters.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.881
[laughs]

14:39.462 --> 14:41.881
Yeah, but if I tattoo

14:39.462 --> 14:41.881
it on my arm

14:41.922 --> 14:45.259
it probably won't

14:41.922 --> 14:45.259
hurt that much.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.262
Well, you've already passed

14:45.301 --> 14:48.262
the pre-interview.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.724
Oh, sorry!

14:48.304 --> 14:50.724
Guys, this is Viper.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.226
- Hey.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.226
- Hey, I'm her father Mildew.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.227
You could tattoo

14:53.267 --> 14:54.227
that on your--

14:54.268 --> 14:57.522
Hey, hey!

14:54.268 --> 14:57.522
Ho ho ho!

14:57.564 --> 14:58.565
Listen, uh, Mildew..

14:58.606 --> 15:00.441
...just wait over there.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.942
Viper, you can,

15:00.483 --> 15:01.942
uh, you can

15:01.984 --> 15:05.279
plug into the, uh,

15:01.984 --> 15:05.279
freshly scrubbed amp here.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.824
And, uh, let's see

15:05.321 --> 15:07.824
what you got.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.704
[music from guitar]

15:24.465 --> 15:27.552
[music continues]

15:47.363 --> 15:50.450
[music continues]

16:00.627 --> 16:03.212
[applauding]

16:06.340 --> 16:07.467
Alright, man.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.010
You got some pretty

16:07.508 --> 16:10.010
juicy chops there.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.972
Funny, I said that

16:10.052 --> 16:12.972
to the butcher this morning.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.558
The point is, that was...

16:13.013 --> 16:15.558
pretty incredible.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.643
Thanks.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.853
Congratulations, Viper!

16:18.895 --> 16:21.522
- You got the gig.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.522
- Oh, thank you.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.774
Yeah, congratulations!

16:22.816 --> 16:24.275
Ho ho ho!

16:22.816 --> 16:24.275
Mildew, Mildew.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.444
Mildew, Mildew.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.404
Listen, uh..

16:28.446 --> 16:30.490
...you got some pretty

16:28.446 --> 16:30.490
juicy chops yourself.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.284
Yeah, I know. They're marinating

16:30.531 --> 16:33.284
in the refrigerator.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.203
I'm serious. I'm serious.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.203
You were very impressive.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.123
You know, if Viper hadn't

16:36.245 --> 16:39.123
come down here blown us all away

16:39.165 --> 16:41.167
I can safely

16:39.165 --> 16:41.167
say this now, I..

16:41.208 --> 16:43.419
...I would've offered

16:41.208 --> 16:43.419
you the gig.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.004
- Really?

16:43.461 --> 16:45.004
- Mm-hmm.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.130
Wow!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.966
And, Jess, just thinking

16:46.172 --> 16:47.966
that you..

16:48.007 --> 16:49.175
...think I was good enough

16:48.007 --> 16:49.175
for your band

16:49.216 --> 16:50.343
that really means

16:49.216 --> 16:50.343
a lot to me.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.136
Yeah, ain't no thing.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.264
I hear you,

16:52.178 --> 16:55.264
<i>brotha</i> man!

16:55.306 --> 16:56.808
You know, it would've been

16:55.306 --> 16:56.808
a lot of fun for you and me

16:56.850 --> 16:58.225
just gigging

16:56.850 --> 16:58.225
on the road together.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.352
Oh, yeah!

16:59.393 --> 17:01.479
Sitting on that bus

16:59.393 --> 17:01.479
all the time

17:01.521 --> 17:02.814
just looking out

17:01.521 --> 17:02.814
the window together

17:02.856 --> 17:04.023
watching the old highway

17:02.856 --> 17:04.023
go by.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.566
Yeah.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.443
Uh, playing

17:05.608 --> 17:07.443
license plate bingo.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.278
- Oh!

17:07.485 --> 17:09.278
- Sharing a nut log.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.238
Hm.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.782
Yeah, it's gonna

17:11.280 --> 17:12.782
be tough

17:12.824 --> 17:15.576
but I'm gonna

17:12.824 --> 17:15.576
have to get over it.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.119
Thanks. Mildew,

17:15.618 --> 17:17.119
ladies and gentlemen!

17:17.161 --> 17:18.412
Mildew!

17:18.454 --> 17:19.747
Mildew!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
Thank you

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
for being born.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.260
[giggling]

17:33.302 --> 17:36.347
Uh-oh. Look who's back.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.347
Mr. Madstone.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.557
Don't provoke him.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.768
Let's just straighten up

17:37.598 --> 17:40.768
and fly right.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.981
Even better, let's give him

17:40.810 --> 17:44.981
the silent treatment.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.941
Alright, everyone,

17:45.023 --> 17:46.941
well, uh

17:46.983 --> 17:49.402
let's get started,

17:46.983 --> 17:49.402
shall we?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.863
And, uh, by the way,

17:49.443 --> 17:51.863
it's really nice to see

17:51.905 --> 17:55.533
all of your bright, shiny,

17:51.905 --> 17:55.533
smiling faces again today.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.871
Okay.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.539
How about a little, uh,

17:59.913 --> 18:01.539
geography?

18:01.581 --> 18:02.999
Why don't we, uh, why don't we

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
go over some

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
state capitals?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.127
Um, let's start

18:04.918 --> 18:07.127
with California.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.672
The state capital

18:07.169 --> 18:09.672
of California is?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.049
'Anyone?'

18:13.009 --> 18:14.844
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll give

18:13.009 --> 18:14.844
you a little hint.

18:14.886 --> 18:18.305
It starts with sac

18:14.886 --> 18:18.305
and ends with remento.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.519
Of course, it's right here,

18:20.391 --> 18:23.519
near the Sacramento airport.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.147
[imitating Popeye]

18:25.145 --> 18:27.147
Gosh, that map's on a roll.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.693
[laughing]

18:30.735 --> 18:32.403
Oh, hey, well,

18:30.735 --> 18:32.403
now that's a lot better

18:32.445 --> 18:33.780
than the silent treatment.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.198
[laughing]

18:36.240 --> 18:38.034
If you thought

18:36.240 --> 18:38.034
that was funny

18:38.076 --> 18:39.953
then you're gonna love

18:38.076 --> 18:39.953
this next impression

18:39.994 --> 18:42.204
I've been working on.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.204
It's brand-new.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.748
And it's called..

18:43.790 --> 18:47.085
..."the first astronaut

18:43.790 --> 18:47.085
on the face of the sun."

18:47.126 --> 18:48.127
Ouch, ooh! Ouch!

18:48.168 --> 18:49.378
Ooh ow ouch!

18:49.420 --> 18:50.880
Come on, you guys

18:49.420 --> 18:50.880
get up and try it.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.214
(all)

18:50.922 --> 18:52.214
Ooh! Ouch!

18:52.256 --> 18:53.507
(all)

18:52.256 --> 18:53.507
Ow ow! Ooh ow!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.175
It's hot.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.553
Ooh, it's hot.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.682
[clears throat]

19:04.060 --> 19:06.562
Boy, you got

19:04.060 --> 19:06.562
to teach me that.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.689
What's going on here,

19:06.604 --> 19:08.689
Mr. Gladstone?

19:08.731 --> 19:10.733
Well, Mrs. Homewood,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.733
actually, uh

19:10.775 --> 19:15.780
you caught us in a rousing round

19:10.775 --> 19:15.780
of...spelling tag.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.823
Mm-hmm.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.616
Uh, Derek, you're it.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.826
Conjunctivitis. Go.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.953
C-O-N-J-U..

19:25.039 --> 19:26.290
Mr. Gladstone,

19:25.039 --> 19:26.290
may I see you

19:26.332 --> 19:28.542
in the hall...now?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.378
I think, now would be

19:28.584 --> 19:31.378
a-a very good time. Sure.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.839
[clears throat]

19:37.468 --> 19:38.886
[door closes]

19:42.890 --> 19:44.058
What's going on?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.643
Any sign of blood?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.561
She's wagging

19:45.685 --> 19:47.561
her finger at him.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.897
Are her eyebrows

19:47.603 --> 19:49.897
hopping up and down?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.650
Like two angry

19:49.939 --> 19:52.650
caterpillars.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.991
She's really mad.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.991
Poor Joey.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.035
Gosh, an honest-to-goodness

20:00.033 --> 20:02.035
dressing-down

20:02.076 --> 20:04.203
if there ever were one.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.081
And it's all our fault.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.457
He's coming!

20:16.549 --> 20:19.426
Did you get fired

20:16.549 --> 20:19.426
because of us?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.595
Uh, no, actually,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.595
I told Mrs. Homewood

20:21.637 --> 20:23.305
that it's just

20:21.637 --> 20:23.305
not working out.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.350
So you guys are gonna see a film

20:23.347 --> 20:26.350
strip in about 15 minutes.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.061
(all)

20:26.392 --> 20:28.061
No.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.812
Hey, I'm sorry, guys,

20:28.102 --> 20:29.812
but yesterday

20:29.854 --> 20:31.856
when I tried to be tough

20:29.854 --> 20:31.856
and get down to business

20:31.898 --> 20:33.232
you all hated me!

20:33.273 --> 20:34.608
We didn't hate you.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.276
We just wanted to have fun!

20:36.318 --> 20:37.570
Well, now we're having fun

20:37.611 --> 20:38.863
and you're not learning

20:37.611 --> 20:38.863
anything, either.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.032
So...that's not working out..

20:41.074 --> 20:42.449
...which is too bad

20:41.074 --> 20:42.449
'cause I was gonna

20:42.491 --> 20:43.784
teach you a lot

20:42.491 --> 20:43.784
of neat stuff

20:43.826 --> 20:46.829
like state capitals,

20:43.826 --> 20:46.829
long division

20:46.871 --> 20:49.165
how to suck an egg

20:46.871 --> 20:49.165
into a bottle.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.333
Did I hear

20:49.207 --> 20:51.333
long division?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.044
Derek, be quiet!

20:53.086 --> 20:56.505
We wanna see

20:53.086 --> 20:56.505
that egg sucking thing.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.340
No, I don't-I don't

20:56.547 --> 20:58.340
think so, guys.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.800
(all)

20:58.382 --> 20:59.800
'Aw.'

21:02.095 --> 21:05.598
Joey, don't quit.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.598
It's all my fault.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.184
No, Michelle, it's not

21:05.639 --> 21:08.184
your fault. It's me.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.103
I'm just not

21:08.226 --> 21:10.103
a very good teacher.

21:10.144 --> 21:14.148
We never gave you a chance,

21:10.144 --> 21:14.148
especially me.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.067
You're so funny,

21:14.190 --> 21:16.067
I forget that sometimes

21:16.109 --> 21:18.611
you have to be serious.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.821
Well, thanks

21:18.652 --> 21:20.821
for understanding, Michelle.

21:20.863 --> 21:24.242
So can we start all over?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.618
I don't know.

21:27.578 --> 21:31.165
Hey, everybody,

21:27.578 --> 21:31.165
don't we want Joey..

21:31.207 --> 21:35.461
Uh, I mean, Mr. Gladstone

21:31.207 --> 21:35.461
to be our teacher?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.255
(all)

21:35.502 --> 21:37.255
Yeah!

21:37.296 --> 21:40.258
Oh, come on, now,

21:37.296 --> 21:40.258
cut it out!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.592
[laughing]

21:41.634 --> 21:44.845
Please, we'll be

21:41.634 --> 21:44.845
as still as statues!

21:44.887 --> 21:47.140
Well, you know, Derek, we don't

21:44.887 --> 21:47.140
have to be as still as statues.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.432
We can still have fun

21:48.474 --> 21:50.392
and learn something

21:48.474 --> 21:50.392
at the same time.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.603
Like how

21:50.434 --> 21:52.603
to suck an egg?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.272
Absolutely!

21:54.313 --> 21:55.648
Alright, kids.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.485
Come on up

21:55.689 --> 21:59.485
to Dr. Gladstone's laboratory!

21:59.526 --> 22:02.155
I'm your host..

22:02.196 --> 22:03.405
...Dr. Gladstone.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.991
'Ha ha ha!'

22:05.032 --> 22:09.287
Now...some people call

22:05.032 --> 22:09.287
this experiment, "magic."

22:09.328 --> 22:12.248
But I call it,

22:09.328 --> 22:12.248
pure science.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.875
There's no way

22:12.290 --> 22:14.875
that this egg

22:14.917 --> 22:16.294
can fit into this bottle.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.631
Alright, unless I take

22:16.335 --> 22:20.631
this piece of paper

22:20.673 --> 22:22.049
and throw it

22:20.673 --> 22:22.049
into the bottle.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.968
Now, you just light it

22:22.091 --> 22:23.968
like this

22:24.010 --> 22:27.054
and be<i> very</i> careful

22:24.010 --> 22:27.054
with fire, kids.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.056
Don't play with it when

22:27.096 --> 22:29.056
your parents aren't around.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.933
It could be

22:29.098 --> 22:30.933
<i>very</i> dangerous.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.185
Stick it

22:30.975 --> 22:32.185
into the bottle.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.020
Now, we put the egg on top

22:34.061 --> 22:35.188
'and watch this.'

22:35.229 --> 22:37.064
The fire burns up

22:35.229 --> 22:37.064
all the oxygen

22:37.106 --> 22:39.733
creating a vacuum and..

22:39.775 --> 22:41.861
...pow!

22:41.902 --> 22:43.737
There goes my lunch, kids!

22:43.779 --> 22:47.116
(all)

22:43.779 --> 22:47.116
Ha ha ha!

22:47.158 --> 22:48.909
Try it with the finger

22:47.158 --> 22:48.909
up in the air.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.829
(all)

22:48.951 --> 22:51.829
Ha ha ha!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.580
Whoa! Kaplowie!
