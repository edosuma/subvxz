"COPS" IS FILMED ON LOCATION

00:33.900 --> 00:35.733
WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.300
ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:38.400 --> 00:40.333
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:42.233 --> 00:45.133
-MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT BEING
A POLICE OFFICER IN STOCKTON

00:45.233 --> 00:47.200
IS I'M A SECOND GENERATION
POLICE OFFICER.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.800
IT'S OBVIOUSLY PRETTY COOL
TO BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN THE SAME
HALLWAYS THAT MY FATHER DID.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.133
THE SECOND THING IS I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE
OVER 13 YEARS.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.933
I'VE BEEN A GANG DETECTIVE,

00:57.033 --> 00:58.867
AND SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR

00:58.967 --> 01:02.100
AND HAVE CONTACTED
MANY GANG MEMBERS.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.100
SOME OF THE THINGS I LOOK FOR
DOING PROACTIVE STUFF

01:05.200 --> 01:09.233
IS SOMEBODY THAT I'VE
CONTACTED IN THE PAST MIGHT
BE ON PROBATION OR PAROLE.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.067
-HE'S GOING STRAIGHT
ON THE SIDEWALK.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.733
I GOT HIM RIGHT THERE
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

01:12.833 --> 01:14.833
-HE'S TRYING TO DUMP
SOMETHING, IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:14.933 --> 01:16.767
-WE HAVE A GUY
ON AN ILLEGAL BIKE.
-WATCH HIS HAND,

01:16.867 --> 01:18.367
WATCH HIS HAND,
WATCH HIS HAND, WATCH HIS HAND.

01:18.467 --> 01:19.867
WATCH HIS HAND.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.700
GET ON THE GROUND!
-GET YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS, NOW!

01:21.800 --> 01:22.900
-GET YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS!

01:23.067 --> 01:24.133
-GET YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS!

01:24.233 --> 01:25.367
-PUT YOUR HANDS STRAIGHT OUT!

01:35.100 --> 01:36.467
5-8-51.
-RELAX.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.400
RELAX YOUR HANDS.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.767
-SO, BASICALLY, THE MOTORCYCLE
THAT HE WAS RIDING, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S AN OFF-ROAD VEHICLE.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.233
NUMEROUS TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.300
OFF-ROAD VEHICLE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE ROADWAY ANYWAY.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.633
-GIVE ME YOUR OTHER HAND.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.733
-LOOK FOR A, UH, LOOK FOR A GUN.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.100
-HE DUMPED A GUN.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.800
-WATCH HIS RIGHT FRONT POCKET.
-OH, YEAH.

02:00.633 --> 02:01.933
-(mumbles)

02:02.067 --> 02:03.933
-CHECK HIM REAL GOOD.
IT MIGHT BE UNDERNEATH HIM.

02:04.067 --> 02:05.500
OR UNDER THE BIKE.
-WHERE IS IT?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.533
-Man: I FOUND IT.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.167
-YOU JUST FOUND THE HOLSTER?
-YEAH.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.767
-I SAW YOU TRYING TO DROP IT.
-NO. I AIN'T DROP
NOTHING THOUGH.

02:10.867 --> 02:12.167
YOU DIDN'T SEE
ME DROPPING NOTHING.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.867
I DIDN'T WANT Y'ALL
THINKING LIKE I HAD SOMETHING
ON ME.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.533
-OH, YOU HAVE ROUNDS IN 'EM.
-AND HE'S GOT ROUNDS.

02:16.633 --> 02:17.900
-OKAY.
-YEAH, THAT'S ALL I GOT THOUGH.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.967
-OH, OKAY. PERFECT.
-BUT THERE'S NO GUN THOUGH.

02:20.067 --> 02:21.267
-CHECK UNDER YOUR CAR.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.533
OR UNDER MY CAR.
-WHERE IS IT?

02:23.633 --> 02:25.700
-I DIDN'T THROW NOTHING.
Y'ALL DIDN'T SEE
ME THROW NOTHING.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.300
-ALL RIGHT.
-I FOUND THEM, MAN.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.133
-ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD
AND SIT UP.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.067
PUT YOUR RIGHT LEG IN
AND STAND UP.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.900
-(mumbles)
WHY ARE YOU GUYS TREATING ME
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG?

02:38.067 --> 02:39.133
-OH, YEAH.

02:39.233 --> 02:42.467
-WE SAW A MALE SUBJECT
RIDING A DIRT BIKE.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.967
HE RODE UP ONTO THE SIDEWALK.

02:45.067 --> 02:49.167
HE WAS TRYING TO REACH
INTO HIS RIGHT WAISTBAND.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.767
WE LOCATED A HOLSTER ON HIM,

02:50.867 --> 02:53.400
WE'RE NOT SURE
IF HE DUMPED A GUN YET.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.567
HE'S GOT SOME LIVE AMMUNITION
ON HIM AS WELL,

02:56.667 --> 02:59.200
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY
AND LOOK AROUND AND SEE
IF MAYBE HE DUMPED A GUN

02:59.300 --> 03:01.567
WHEN HE WAS OUT OF VIEW
FOR A SECOND.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.167
ABOUT RIGHT IN HERE
IS WHEN HE REALLY
STARTED REACHING,

03:04.267 --> 03:05.500
BUT I DIDN'T SEE HIM
THROW ANYTHING.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.233
SO, IT MIGHT HAVE JUST
BEEN THE HOLSTER. I'M NOT SURE.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.233
SOMETIMES THEY WILL JUST HAVE,
YOU KNOW, A HOLSTER
AND SOME AMMUNITION.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.933
YOU FOUND IT?
-YEAH.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.267
-OKAY. WELL, I GUESS HE WAS
THIS FAR BACK WHEN HE STARTED
REACHING, SO.

03:14.367 --> 03:19.300
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE WE LOCATED
A REVOLVER IN FRONT OF THIS
LOCATION IN THE DRIVEWAY.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.367
SO, HE WAS STARTING TO REACH
IN HIS BAND AFTER WE CAME
THIS WAY.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.600
WHAT DO YOU GOT, PARTNER?
-UH, WE TRACED IT BACK
BACK HERE TO 9207

03:25.700 --> 03:27.367
AND FOUND THE GUN
THAT HE WAS DUMPING.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.233
IT'S LOADED,
AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.133
SO, CALLING FOR OUR
FORENSIC TECHS

03:31.233 --> 03:33.500
SO THAT THEY CAN COME
TAKE A PICTURE OF IT IN PLACE,

03:33.600 --> 03:34.933
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE IT SAFE.
-THAT'S GOOD.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.767
SO, WE'LL GO BACK TO THE CAR
AND RUN THIS GUY,

03:36.867 --> 03:38.300
AND SEE WHAT HIS DEAL IS.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.700
-OKAY.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.867
-HEY, MAN.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.267
-HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME, BUD?

03:42.367 --> 03:43.633
-JOSHUA.
-SAY IT AGAIN, I'M SORRY?

03:43.733 --> 03:45.067
-JOSHUA.
-JOSHUA?

03:45.133 --> 03:46.933
OKAY. WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE BIKE, MAN?

03:47.067 --> 03:48.867
-I DON'T KNOW,
I'M JUST RIDING IT.
WHAT, I CAN'T RIDE IT?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.167
-WELL, NO, YOU CAN'T RIDE THAT.
IT'S AN OFF-ROAD BIKE.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.533
YOU CAN'T RIDE THAT
DOWN THE STREET. COME ON,
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.500
-IT SEEMED LIKE IT...
IT JUST SOUNDED FUN.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.467
I, LIKE, JUST RODE THERE...

03:57.567 --> 03:58.900
-WHAT WAS THE DEAL
WITH THE HOLSTER?

03:59.067 --> 04:00.533
-IT'S JUST I HAD A HOLSTER.
THAT'S ALL, MAN.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.500
-YOU STILL GOT IT, YEAH.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.833
-I KNOW. IT'S STUCK ON THERE.
IT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, THIS
CAME WITH THE BELT, I GUESS.

04:04.933 --> 04:06.467
-OH, REALLY? OKAY.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.667
SO, YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THE GUN
THAT'S BACK THERE, HUH?

04:08.767 --> 04:09.933
-NO, I DON'T.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.500
-YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING?
WHAT ABOUT THE AMMUNITION?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.833
-I-- I FOUND THAT TOO.

04:13.933 --> 04:14.867
-OH, YOU FOUND IT?

04:14.967 --> 04:15.933
WHAT ABOUT THE GUN?

04:16.067 --> 04:17.067
-WHAT GUN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:17.133 --> 04:18.600
-THE GUN THAT'S OVER THERE
ON THE GROUND.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.633
-Y'ALL AIN'T SEE ME
THROW NOTHING.
-ARE YOU DOCUMENTED OR ANYTHING?

04:20.733 --> 04:22.400
-I AM DOCUMENTED.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOCUMENTED?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.933
-UH, ABZ, BUT I--
I'M NOT-- THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.

04:25.067 --> 04:27.200
-WHAT'S ABZ, ASIAN BOYS?
-YEAH.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.733
-WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU KICKED IT WITH THEM?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.633
-I DON'T KICK IT WITH THEM.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.767
IT'S JUST-- THEY GOT--
-WHEN DID THEY DOCUMENT YOU?

04:32.867 --> 04:34.900
-IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
DOCUMENTED ME FOR.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.433
-WERE YOU HANGING OUT
WITH THEM OR WHAT?

04:36.533 --> 04:38.667
-UH, NO. I GUESS.

04:38.767 --> 04:39.867
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.800
'CAUSE I WAS WEARING BLUE
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.167
-OH.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.833
-YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED
WITH ANY OF THEM GUYS?

04:44.933 --> 04:46.267
-NO.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.367
-YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED
WITH A GUN BEFORE?

04:48.467 --> 04:50.067
-I AIN'T HAD A GUN.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.300
-HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED
WITH A GUN?
-NO, I HAVEN'T.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.500
-NEVER?
-NO.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.567
-OKAY.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.133
YOU GOT ANY FELONY
CHARGES BEFORE?

04:56.233 --> 04:57.333
-NO.
-NEVER?

04:57.433 --> 05:00.067
-I MEAN, I HAVE A FELONY.
YEAH, A FELONY.
-OKAY.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.267
WHY WOULD YOU NEED
AMMUNITION IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A GUN?

05:02.367 --> 05:03.467
-I AIN'T TOSS NO GUN THOUGH.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.800
-YOU DIDN'T TOSS IT?

05:04.900 --> 05:06.433
-NO.
-WHY WERE YOU REACHING
IN YOUR PANTS BACK THERE?

05:06.533 --> 05:08.833
-I WAS JUST TRYING TO
THROW AWAY MY HOLSTER
'CAUSE Y'ALL GONNA MAKE IT--

05:08.933 --> 05:10.067
-FROM ALL THE WAY BACK THERE?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.133
-DID Y'ALL SEE ME
THROW ANYTHING?

05:11.233 --> 05:12.967
-SO, YOUR DNA'S NOT
GONNA BE ON THAT GUN?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.167
-I DON'T KNOW.

05:14.267 --> 05:15.233
-YOU SURE?

05:15.333 --> 05:16.500
-YEAH, I'M SURE.
-YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

05:16.600 --> 05:17.833
-I'M SURE.
-OKAY.

05:17.933 --> 05:19.067
WELL, WE'RE GONNA CHECK IT.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.933
-Y'ALL CAN CHECK IT.
IT DON'T MATTER.
-OKAY.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.300
YEAH, AND I BET YOU THAT
AMMUNITION THAT'S OVER THERE
ON THE GROUND

05:23.400 --> 05:25.633
IS PROBABLY GONNA BE THE SAME
ONE FOR THAT FIREARM.

05:25.733 --> 05:26.867
-AND WHAT IF IT IS?

05:26.967 --> 05:29.200
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT MAYBE COULD BE A COINCIDENCE.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.067
-COULD BE.
I DOUBT IT THOUGH.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.767
-YEAH. IT DON'T MATTER.
-OKAY.

05:32.867 --> 05:34.333
ALL RIGHT.
SIT TIGHT, OKAY?

05:36.100 --> 05:37.433
-HOW LONG THIS
GONNA TAKE ANYWAY?

05:37.533 --> 05:39.433
-UM, JUST A FEW MINUTES.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.733
-OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT?

05:44.867 --> 05:48.867
RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING
OUR EVIDENCE TECH TAKE PHOTOS
OF THE FIREARM.

05:48.967 --> 05:53.367
THIS IS WHERE IT LANDED
WHEN THE SUBJECT DISCARDED IT

05:53.467 --> 05:55.500
WHILE RIDING THE MOTORCYCLE.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.600
AND AS SOON AS HE'S DONE
PHOTOGRAPHING IT,

05:57.700 --> 06:00.400
OFFICER TACKER WILL MATCH
IT UP TO THE AMMUNITION

06:00.500 --> 06:02.533
THAT THE SUBJECT HAD
ON HIS PERSON.

06:02.633 --> 06:03.833
IT IS STOLEN.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.800
IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN
YESTERDAY IN A BURGLARY.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.067
SO, BASICALLY, WHAT WILL HAPPEN
AFTER HE COLLECTS THIS,

06:08.133 --> 06:10.233
UM, IT'LL GET PROCESSED,

06:10.333 --> 06:12.333
THEY'LL DO--
YOU'LL DO FINGERPRINTS
ON IT, RIGHT, MIKE?

06:12.433 --> 06:14.800
-I'M GONNA SWAB IT
FOR TOUCH DNA.
-OKAY.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.267
-AND THEN CHECK IT
FOR FINGERPRINTS.

06:16.367 --> 06:19.167
-OKAY, AND THEN ALSO
WE'LL DO AN IBIS TEST
ON THIS GUN

06:19.267 --> 06:24.067
THAT'LL TELL US IF THIS FIREARM
HAS BEEN USED IN ANY
OTHER CRIMES.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.067
JOSHUA, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
-YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT IT ALREADY.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.567
-THE BIG THING IS, MAN,
YOU TOSSED THAT GUN

06:28.667 --> 06:30.233
AND THERE WAS 20,
30 KIDS OUT THERE.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.567
OKAY? LUCKILY, ONE OF THOSE KIDS
DIDN'T PICK THAT GUN UP.

06:32.667 --> 06:35.567
OKAY? AND ALL THE AMMUNITION
THAT YOU HAD ON YOU,
THE 10 ROUNDS,

06:35.667 --> 06:37.867
WERE ALL THE SAME THAT
WAS IN THAT FIREARM, OKAY?

06:37.967 --> 06:40.833
SO, YOU'RE GONNA GET CHARGED
WITH HAVING A LOADED FIREARM,

06:40.933 --> 06:42.400
THE AMMUNITION,
RIDING THE BIKE,

06:42.500 --> 06:44.467
AND ALSO,
THAT FIREARM WAS STOLEN.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.100
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BEING
CHARGED WITH, OKAY?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.433
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.467
-YEAH, I UNDERSTAND IT.

06:48.567 --> 06:49.567
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.

06:51.467 --> 06:52.933
-I LOVE BEING A COP.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.967
I DIDN'T THINK THAT I WOULD,

06:55.067 --> 07:00.233
BUT I KNEW I WANTED TO DO A JOB
WHERE I WAS IMPARTING THE SAME
VALUES I IMPART ONTO MY CHILDREN

07:00.333 --> 07:01.567
TO MY COMMUNITY,

07:01.667 --> 07:06.500
AND TO SHARE THE SAME
COMPASSION I HAVE AS A HUMAN

07:06.600 --> 07:08.067
WITH THE SOCIETY AROUND ME.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.967
-THIS IS A KNOWN DRUG AREA,

07:10.067 --> 07:12.133
AND THERE'S A SUSPICIOUS
TRUCK OVER HERE

07:12.233 --> 07:14.300
WITH A COUPLE GUYS
HANGING AROUND IT.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.100
-I'M GUESSING THAT'S GONNA BE
A HAND-TO-HAND DRUG EXCHANGE.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.333
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.767
ARE THERE KEYS IN THIS CAR?
-YES, SIR.

07:28.867 --> 07:31.133
-OKAY, DON'T TOUCH THE KEYS.
PUT YOUR HANDS ON TOP
OF THE CAR!

07:31.233 --> 07:34.333
IF YOU ACT SQUIRRELLY,
WE ARE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM
REALLY FAST.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.633
-Man:
I WAS TRYING
TO BRING YOU MY HAND.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.067
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME, PARTNER?

07:37.100 --> 07:39.067
WILLIAM, THAT
WAS REALLY STUPID.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.067
I SAW YOU CRUMPLE THAT UP
AND TRY TO GET RID OF IT.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.300
-YES, SIR.
-DID YOU JUST BUY DOPE
FROM THIS GUY?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.167
-NO.
-WERE YOU SELLING DOPE
TO THIS GUY?

07:46.267 --> 07:47.467
-I WASN'T.
-OR ARE YOU JUST USING DOPE?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.333
-I WAS KIND OF
THE MIDDLE MAN.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.167
WE WERE JUST PASSING IT TO HIM.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.967
-OKAY. HOW MUCH DO YOU
HAVE ON YOU RIGHT NOW?

07:53.067 --> 07:56.633
-I JUST HAVE 30 CENTS...
$30 WORTH OF...

07:56.733 --> 07:58.267
-OKAY.

07:58.367 --> 08:01.500
WHY DON'T WE START OFF
WITH YOU REACHING DOWN
AND HANDING THAT TO ME.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.200
-OKAY.
-IT'S A LITTLE TINY PIECE.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.667
DO YOU WANNA
HAVE A CONVERSATION,
OR ARE YOU GONNA EAT THIS?

08:08.767 --> 08:11.267
-I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.067
-OKAY. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.800
DO YOU HAVE MORE PRODUCT

08:15.900 --> 08:17.200
-I DO HAVE.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.200

IF YOU GET SQUIRRELLY,
I'M GONNA DUMP YOU, OKAY?

08:22.833 --> 08:23.900
-YES, SIR.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.467

08:25.567 --> 08:27.067
-YES, SIR.

08:28.567 --> 08:29.633
-STEP OVER.

08:29.733 --> 08:31.333
INTERLACE YOUR FINGERS,
SEPARATE YOUR FEET.

08:31.433 --> 08:32.933
SEPARATE THEM WIDE FOR ME.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.900
ARE YOU ON PROBATION
OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES?

08:35.067 --> 08:37.167
-UNSUPERVISED OUT OF COLORADO.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.633
-FOR WHAT? PUT YOUR
HANDS DOWN. WHAT?

08:38.733 --> 08:39.700
-THEFT.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.867
-THEFT?
-IN 2014.

08:41.967 --> 08:43.667
-HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO BE ON PROBATION FOR?

08:43.767 --> 08:47.133
-IT'S OVER IN JUNE OF 2016.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.667
-WHAT'S WITH THE BLOOD
ON YOUR HEAD? WHAT'S THAT
ALL ABOUT?

08:49.767 --> 08:51.667
-I THINK IT WAS A ZIT
I JUST POPPED.

08:52.867 --> 08:57.300
-YOU GOTTA FOCUS HARDER
ON NOT MAKING YOURSELF LOOK
SILLY WHEN YOU DO THAT, OKAY?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.700
-YES, SIR.
-ISN'T THE GOAL
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.567
DID YOU ALREADY RECEIVE
THE MONEY FROM THIS GUY?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.700
-YEAH. THAT'S
THE MONEY RIGHT THERE.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.467
-HOW MUCH WAS IT?
-$30.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.433
-OKAY.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.067
HAVE A SEAT OVER HERE.

09:11.433 --> 09:14.067
DRIVER TRIED TO DUMP
A LITTLE NUGGET OF HEROIN

09:14.100 --> 09:16.467
ON THE GROUND,
AND NOW WE'RE FINDING A SAFE

09:16.567 --> 09:19.667
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR,
AND THIS PASSENGER OVER HERE

09:19.767 --> 09:22.400
IS THE ONE
WHO'S GOT THE SAFE.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.733
STAND UP AND COME TALK TO ME.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.667
THIS IS YOUR METHADONE.
IT'S GOT YOUR NAME ON IT.

09:28.767 --> 09:29.800
-MM-HMM.
-OKAY.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.600
THERE'S A LITTLE NUGGET
OF HEROIN IN HERE.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.567
HERE'S YOUR SCALE THAT
WAS IN YOUR BACKPACK.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.900
I CAN'T TELL IF THIS IS HEROIN
OR IF THIS IS BUNK.

09:37.067 --> 09:39.133
NO, IT SMELLS LIKE IT'S HEROIN.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.600
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
AN EIGHT-BALL THERE?

09:41.700 --> 09:43.067
-I DON'T KNOW.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.167
-WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO STAY HIGH OR...?

09:45.267 --> 09:50.267
-I-- I HONESTLY ONLY--
I DON'T USE VERY MUCH,
UM, METHADONE.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.967
-HOW MUCH ARE YOU USING
A DAY RIGHT NOW, MAN?

09:52.067 --> 09:54.367
-LIKE 20 CENTS.

09:54.467 --> 09:55.933
-20 CENTS?

09:56.067 --> 09:59.067
SO HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE TO PICK UP
TO KEEP THAT HABIT AFLOAT?

09:59.100 --> 10:01.033
-40 CENTS.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.133
-YOU PICK UP 40,
YOU CUT IT IN HALF...

10:03.233 --> 10:06.800
-I STARTED USING AFTER I GOT
STABBED IN AUGUST LAST YEAR.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.633
-WE NEED TO GET YOU
MORE HELP, PARTNER.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.367
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.733
-IT HURTS.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.400
-GIVE ME YOUR OTHER HAND.
-YES, SIR.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.267
I'M RELAXED.
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.600
-I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
-I SAID I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.233
I'M RELAXED.
-YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.533
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU EITHER.

10:24.633 --> 10:25.967
I WILL DO MY BEST
TO GET YOU SOME HELP,

10:26.067 --> 10:28.067
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WORK A LOT HARDER
THAN YOU'RE WORKING,

10:28.167 --> 10:30.333
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.033
HAVE A SEAT ON THE CURB.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.467
WILLIAM, YOU HAVE A WARRANT
OUT OF COLORADO.

10:37.567 --> 10:38.867
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

10:38.967 --> 10:41.033
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA
EXTRADITE YOU.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.900
-IT'S OVER A MISDEMEANOR.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.500
I TRIED TAKING CARE OF IT
THROUGH THE MAIL

10:44.600 --> 10:45.833
AND THEY SENT THE WARRANT,

10:45.933 --> 10:47.900
AND NOW I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET THE FUNDS FOR A LAWYER.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.833
-YOU ARE FREE TO GO, OKAY?

10:50.933 --> 10:52.000
ALL RIGHT?

10:52.100 --> 10:55.233
MY REQUEST TO YOU
IS JUST, YOU KNOW,

10:55.333 --> 10:57.800
JUST FIGURE IT OUT, MAN.
-PARDON FOR YOUR TIME.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.600
-GOOD LUCK, MAN.
-YEAH, THANK YOU.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.633
-OKAY, STAND UP.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.067
IT'S CONFIRMED THAT
YOU HAVE TO GO TO JAIL

11:05.133 --> 11:07.067
ON YOUR WARRANT.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.867
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHERWISE,

11:10.967 --> 11:13.967
BECAUSE WHEN I ROLL UP
AND I SEE YOU DOING

11:14.067 --> 11:17.767
A HAND-TO-HAND
WITH JOHNNY-COME-TWEAKING
DOWN THE BLOCK OVER HERE...

11:19.467 --> 11:21.433
-YES, SIR?
-YOU'RE DEAD TO RIGHTS.

11:21.533 --> 11:22.900
HE HANDED YOU THE MONEY,

11:23.067 --> 11:24.400
YOU WERE HANDING HIM THE DOPE,

11:24.500 --> 11:26.767
YOU SAW ME,
YOU TRIED TO DITCH THE DOPE.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.433
-I DIDN'T TRY TO DITCH.

11:28.533 --> 11:31.233
I JUST DROPPED EVERYTHING.
-I SAW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.433
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

11:32.533 --> 11:34.133
IT'S NOT THAT I NEED
YOU TO APOLOGIZE,

11:34.233 --> 11:35.833
I NEED YOU
TO TAKE INVENTORY.

11:35.933 --> 11:38.900
I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT YOURSELF
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT AUTHORITY

11:39.067 --> 11:41.233
I HAVE HERE, I KNOW
WHAT I CAN SLAP ON YOU,

11:41.333 --> 11:42.700
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.933
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED
IS TO GET CLEAN

11:45.067 --> 11:47.233
'CAUSE YOU'RE SCREWING UP, MAN.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

11:47.333 --> 11:48.867
-I'M GONNA BE 22 NEXT MONTH.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.467
-22. HOW LONG YOU BEEN USING?

11:50.567 --> 11:52.667
-MM, OFF AND ON
FOR A FEW YEARS.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.400
-GO AHEAD AND TURN AROUND.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.900
CAN I USE YOUR CUFFS FOR THIS?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.433
THANK YOU.

12:01.533 --> 12:04.600
WHEN IT COMES TO A WARRANT,
MY HANDS ARE TIED.
-I UNDERSTAND.

12:04.700 --> 12:05.833
I UNDERSTAND.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.533
-SO, I'LL DO MY BEST FOR YOU.

12:08.633 --> 12:09.733
THANK YOU.

12:09.833 --> 12:12.167
-ALL RIGHT, BUD.
COME WALK BACK OVER HERE.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.900
-ALL RIGHT, PARTNER.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.967
THIS DRUG IS
GOING TO KILL YOU...

12:17.067 --> 12:18.867
-I KNOW THAT.
-AND YOU MIGHT NOT
CALL IT DRUG DEALING

12:18.967 --> 12:21.067
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THAT GUY
DRIVING INTO THE TOWN

12:21.100 --> 12:23.500
WITH BACKPACKS FULL OF HEROIN,
BUT I'M LETTING YOU KNOW.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.433
-HOW AM I SELLING
WHEN I DON'T GOT NO MONEY?
-OKAY...

12:25.533 --> 12:27.733
I... I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH YOU ABOUT THAT.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.200
THAT'S-- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE MAKING A KILLING.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.733
I'M SAYING YOU'RE
KILLING YOURSELF...
-I UNDERSTAND THAT.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.367
-...BY SELLING DRUGS
AND USING DRUGS.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.067
I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU'RE OUT THERE...

12:36.167 --> 12:37.733
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
DRIVING IN A MERCEDES.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.333
I DON'T THINK YOU GOT
A LAMBORGHINI AT HOME

12:39.433 --> 12:42.067
IN THE GARAGE
OF YOUR 16-BEDROOM HOUSE,

12:42.133 --> 12:44.100
BUT I WANT THAT FOR YOU,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.967
AND THIS IS NOT
THE WAY TO GET THERE.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.700
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL.
THIS PARKING LOT

12:49.800 --> 12:52.333
IS WITHIN 1,000 FEET
OF A SCHOOL,

12:52.433 --> 12:55.300
WHICH IN OREGON BUMPS UP
THE LEVEL OF YOUR CRIME.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.733
I AM NOT GOING TO
BUMP THAT CRIME UP

12:58.833 --> 13:01.067
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL DOPE

13:01.100 --> 13:02.667
TO LITTLE KIDS,
BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE PUTTING

13:02.767 --> 13:04.967
PEOPLE IN DANGER,
INCLUDING YOURSELF.

13:05.067 --> 13:08.133
SO, TODAY YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR POSSESSION OF HEROIN,

13:08.233 --> 13:10.467
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE DELIVERY OF HEROIN.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.800
AS FAR AS
THE REST OF IT GOES,

13:13.900 --> 13:17.067
IF YOU WANT HELP,
I WILL HELP YOU GET THAT,

13:17.133 --> 13:18.267
BUT YOU HAVE TO
REACH OUT FOR IT

13:18.367 --> 13:20.567
BECAUSE THIS IS
A DEAD END STREET.
-I HAVE.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.067
-WHEN I WAS DECIDING
WHERE TO GO TO COLLEGE,

13:24.167 --> 13:26.067
WISCONSIN WAS
A LITTLE COLD FOR ME,

13:26.133 --> 13:28.300
SO I DECIDED I WANTED
TO COME DOWN SOUTH.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.967
I WENT TO UNLV,
AND WHILE I WAS DOING THAT,

13:32.067 --> 13:33.967
I WAS WORKING
AS A POKER DEALER

13:34.067 --> 13:36.200
AT A COUPLE DIFFERENT CASINOS,

13:36.300 --> 13:38.167
AND THAT'S KINDA HOW
I PAID MY WAY

13:38.267 --> 13:40.500
OR KINDA HELPED
MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.133
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
TO A DOMESTIC

13:42.233 --> 13:45.700
WHERE A MALE WAS SEEN
HOLDING DOWN A FEMALE

13:45.800 --> 13:49.300
AND BEING VIOLENT
WITH HER IN SOME WAY.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.833
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE
ARRIVING ON THIS THING HERE.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.500
SEE ANY NUMBERS YET?

13:57.600 --> 13:58.567
-36.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.067
-WHAT'S THAT?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.800
-THEY'RE IN THE BACK.
-OH, YOU GOT IT?

14:01.900 --> 14:03.500
-POLICE DEPARTMENT.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.533
-THEY'RE IN THE BACK.
THE BACK ROOM.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.067
-WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

14:14.133 --> 14:15.800
-Man:

14:15.900 --> 14:17.467
SHOOTS DRUGS...

14:17.567 --> 14:20.800
(indistinct)

14:20.900 --> 14:22.600
-I'LL TAKE HIM,
TALK TO HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
COME ON OVER HERE.
SET ALL THAT DOWN.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.400
-SIT UP FOR A MINUTE.
-Woman: I CAN'T.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.667
-RIGHT HERE?
-YEAH, YOU'RE GOOD.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.533
-SIT UP FOR ME.
-YEAH. OKAY.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.067
-CAN YOU SIT UP?

14:31.167 --> 14:32.800
-OKAY, SO WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.267
-Man:

14:34.367 --> 14:35.767
-YOUR EX-GIRL?
-YEAH.

14:35.867 --> 14:38.300
SHE COMES IN, SHE STARTS
ATTACKING ME AND ALL RED.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.600
BEG HER TO STOP,
ASK HER TO...

14:39.700 --> 14:40.867
-DO YOU LIVE HERE
OR SHE LIVES HERE?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.200
-NO, I LIVE HERE.
-YOU LIVE HERE.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.633
SO SHE CAME OVER...
-YEAH.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.233
-SHE STARTS ATTACKING YOU...

14:45.333 --> 14:46.633

I SAID, "CUT IT OUT."

14:46.733 --> 14:48.700
SHE GOES, "WHAT?"
'CAUSE I CAUGHT HER TWO DAYS AGO

14:48.800 --> 14:49.733
TRYING TO SHOOT A NEEDLE.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.333

15:27.067 --> 15:28.300
-HER STUFF WAS HERE AND I SAID--

15:28.400 --> 15:30.067
I'M JUST SAYING THAT'S
WHAT SHE'S ANGRY ABOUT THOUGH

15:30.133 --> 15:31.333

-RIGHT.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.833

-SHE WAS GOING OFF ON
HAVING TO MOVE OUT,

15:49.967 --> 15:51.533
GOING OFF ON
YOU NOT MARRYING HER...
-RIGHT. RIGHT.

15:51.633 --> 15:53.100
RIGHT. AND I TOLD HER
I WAS CLEANING--

15:53.200 --> 15:55.267
-AND SO NOW SHE STARTS
ATTACKING YOU BECAUSE
YOU WON'T MARRY HER.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.400
-YEAH. SHE'S APPARENTLY
SCHIZOPHRENIC AND GOT
FOUR PERSONALITIES.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.467
-OKAY.
-OKAY, SO I DON'T KNOW
WHO STEPPED OUT OF HERE.

15:59.567 --> 16:00.900
-THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PROBLEM, SO YEAH,

16:01.067 --> 16:02.900
DO ME A FAVOR.
HANG TIGHT, STAY HERE
WITH MY PARTNER.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.067
I WANT YOU TO STAY SEATED, OKAY?

16:04.133 --> 16:05.900
-YEAH. NO PROBLEM.
-JUST GIVE ME A SEC.

16:06.067 --> 16:09.300
OKAY, SO HE'S TRYING
TO SEND YOU OFF
TO GO GET PIMPED...

16:09.400 --> 16:12.067
YOU GUYS... YOU REFUSED
TO GO WITH HIM, RIGHT?

16:12.167 --> 16:14.067
-THAT'S WHEN HE GRABBED ME
AND THE DRESSER FELL DOWN.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.767
AND THEN HE GOT ON TOP OF ME.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.733
-YOU GO TO GRAB THE PHONE
OFF THIS COUNTER...

16:17.833 --> 16:19.133
-NOT OFF THE COUNTER.
-NO?

16:19.233 --> 16:20.733
-IN THE DRAWER.
-IN THE DRAWER.

16:20.833 --> 16:24.267
SO HE WAS TRYING TO
FORCE HER TO GO TO
A PIMP'S HOUSE,

16:24.367 --> 16:26.833
PUNCHES HER IN THE NOSE
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANNA GO.

16:26.933 --> 16:28.767
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY MARKS ON HER NOSE.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.767
SHE DOESN'T WANT
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

16:30.867 --> 16:33.167
SHE SAID SHE GOES
TO CALL THE POLICE,

16:33.267 --> 16:35.267
REACHES FOR HER PHONE
THAT'S IN THE DESK,

16:35.367 --> 16:38.167
HE PUSHES THE DESK DOWN,
THROWS HER ON THE GROUND.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.533
THAT'S WHEN WE CAME IN.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.067
-THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING.
-DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.433
-NO.
-THEY DIDN'T SEE NOTHING?

16:42.533 --> 16:45.067
-THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE
OUT HERE ON THE STEPS HERE,

16:45.133 --> 16:47.833
BUT LET ME GO SEE
WHAT THEY GOT TO SAY,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.200
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
-SO I'LL GO
FIND OUT THOUGH FOR YOU.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.500
-IS SHE DONE?
-YEAH.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.767
-HELLO.
-HOW ARE YOU DOING, OFFICER?

16:54.867 --> 16:56.367
-DOING OKAY.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.067
HEY, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

16:58.133 --> 17:02.067
-UM, WELL, STARTING EARLIER,
BEFORE, SHE HIT ON HIM
DURING THE DAYTIME.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.667
-HOW'D SHE HIT HIM?
IN THE FACE, IN THE CHEST,
IN THE ARM?

17:04.767 --> 17:06.200
-IT WAS IN THE CHEST.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.100
SHE HASN'T PUNCHED HIM--
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER PUNCH HIM
IN THE FACE YET.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.667
-SHE PUNCHED HIM ONE TIME
IN THE CHEST?
-YES.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.700
SHE'S VERY VIOLENT.
-WAS IT PLAYFUL, OR
WAS IT ACTUALLY, LIKE--

17:11.800 --> 17:14.567
-ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THIS CHICK IS VIOLENT AND LOUD.
-YEAH?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.600
-IF YOU WERE TO ASK
ANYBODY AROUND HERE,

17:16.700 --> 17:18.100
SHE GOES OFF
AT THE DROP OF A DIME.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.867
AND THEN TONIGHT,
SHE THROWS A BEER AT HIM,

17:19.967 --> 17:21.800
AND SHE HITS HIM,
SHE PULLED THE DRESSER
DOWN ON HIM--

17:21.900 --> 17:24.133
-SO YOU SAW HER--
HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU SEE HER HIT HIM?

17:24.233 --> 17:26.133
-UM, I WENT TO GO GET MY PHONE
TO CALL YOU GUYS,

17:26.233 --> 17:27.400
BUT I MEAN,
I'D SAY A COUPLE.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.633
YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T STAY HERE.
THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER.

17:29.733 --> 17:31.767
THIS IS ALL HER JUNK
THAT HE HELPED HER MOVE.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.800
HE'S VERY RESPECTFUL
AND SHE JUST KEPT
COMING AT HIM.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.800
SHE'S RED WITH RAGE,
SO HE RESTRAINED HER

17:35.900 --> 17:38.667
BECAUSE IF I GET INVOLVED
IN SOME KIND OF ARGUMENT
BETWEEN US...

17:38.767 --> 17:40.267
HE DIDN'T HIT HER,
HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING ELSE,

17:40.367 --> 17:42.167
BUT SHE'S JUST CONSTANTLY
GOING AT HIM, SO HE'S...

17:42.267 --> 17:43.667
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.367
SHE DIDN'T HIT HER HEAD
UP AGAINST ANYTHING

17:45.467 --> 17:47.667
'CAUSE I'M SITTING HERE
LISTENING, AND AS WE'RE
WAITING FOR YOU GUYS,

17:47.767 --> 17:50.067
SHE SAYS, "I'M GONNA
TELL THE COPS THIS.
I'MMA TELL THE COPS THAT."

17:50.100 --> 17:52.100
SO, I MADE SURE TO STAY HERE
TO MAKE SURE I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.367
-OH, I SEE.
-SO YEAH. EXACTLY.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.067
-SO WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING,
SHE WAS SAYING THAT?

17:55.133 --> 17:57.200
-YEAH, WHILE SHE'S
BEING RESTRAINED, "I'M GONNA
TELL THEM THIS AND THIS."

17:57.300 --> 17:58.967
YOU KNOW, IMAGINARY STUFF
SO THAT HE GETS IN TROUBLE.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.767
BUT I AM ASSURING YOU
HE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG.

18:00.867 --> 18:04.133
-I SEE. OKAY.
-I THINK SHE CALMED DOWN WHEN
I SAID THE POLICE ARE COMING.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.833
-OKAY. JUST HANG TIGHT
FOR US FOR A LITTLE BIT.

18:05.933 --> 18:08.067
LET ME GO TALK TO MY PARTNER
AND WE'LL BE BACK HERE, OKAY?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.133
-OKAY.
-ALL RIGHTY. THANK YOU.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.700
-NO PROBLEM.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.067
-GET UP.
-Woman: HE BANGED MY FACE
INTO THE THING.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.767
-DO ME A FAVOR
AND FACE THE WALL.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.400
SEPARATE YOUR FEET FOR ME.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.367
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

18:18.467 --> 18:19.667
BOTH OF THEM.

18:19.767 --> 18:21.833
PUT THEM TOGETHER.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.333
YOU'RE BEING ARRESTED
FOR BATTERY DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE, MA'AM.

18:24.433 --> 18:27.533
-WHAT? HOW IS THAT--
-BATTERY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.267
-IS HE BEING ARRESTED?
-NO, HE'S NOT.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.233
-I WILL BE TAKING
THIS TO COURT.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.367
-Man: I'M GLAD YOU GOT HER.
-ABSOLUTELY.

18:34.467 --> 18:37.333
UM, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR
AND TRY TO GET OUT
OF THAT RELATIONSHIP.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.367
-I'M GONNA GET
MY ASS KICKED IN A SECOND, MAN.

18:39.467 --> 18:40.767
-OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

18:40.867 --> 18:42.267
-(indistinct)

18:42.367 --> 18:44.967
IN FACT, YOU GOTTA SEE
THE NIKE PRINT IN HERE,
OKAY, MAN?

18:45.067 --> 18:46.833
-SHE'S GONNA PUT
A NIKE PRINT ON YOUR BUTT?

18:46.933 --> 18:48.433
-JUST HANG TIGHT FOR US
FOR A LITTLE BIT

18:48.533 --> 18:50.700
AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, ALL RIGHT?
-NO PROBLEM. THANKS, MAN.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.500
-LET ME TALK WITH HER
WHEN SHE'S BACK THERE.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.067
-GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.500
WATCH YOUR HEAD.
-HEY, MA'AM?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.300
LET ME TALK TO YOU REAL QUICK.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.133
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

18:59.233 --> 19:03.367
-HE HIT ME IN MY NOSE
AND THAT'S WHEN I DID
THROW MY BEER ON HIM.

19:03.467 --> 19:07.600
I DON'T WANT TO BE OVER TO
SOMEBODY'S HOUSE I DON'T KNOW.
-UNDERSTANDABLE.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.100
-I DON'T WANT TO BE
TREATED LIKE THAT.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.100
-LISTEN, THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
WAS TELLING US THAT YOU WERE

19:11.200 --> 19:12.967
YELLING THAT YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE STUFF UP TO US,

19:13.067 --> 19:14.567
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE STRAIGHT WITH ME--

19:14.667 --> 19:16.800
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO TAKE A LIE DETECTOR.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.133
-WHY WAS IT THAT YOU WOULD SAY
THAT YOU WOULD MAKE UP
STUFF TO US?

19:19.233 --> 19:21.067
-ALL YOU CAN DO IS
GIVE ME A LIE DETECTOR TEST,

19:21.167 --> 19:23.400
AND THAT'S ALL I CAN DO, OKAY?

19:23.500 --> 19:24.933
I DON'T KNOW.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.967
HE DID PUNCH ME
IN MY NOSE.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.867
-HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU'RE GETTING
ARRESTED FOR BATTERY
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, OKAY?

19:29.967 --> 19:31.667
MY PARTNER ALREADY
TOLD YOU THIS, OKAY?

19:31.767 --> 19:34.533
IT'S TIME TO GET AWAY
FROM HIM AND TRY TO GET
AWAY FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.200
IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S NOT WORKING, OKAY?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.567
ALL RIGHTY. LET'S HAVE A SEAT.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.767
-SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
MIXING ALCOHOL WITH PAINKILLERS
AND HEROIN, SO...

19:41.867 --> 19:43.167
-TENDS TO DO THAT.
-WELL, YEAH.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.067
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE CAME DOWN, THANKFULLY,

19:45.100 --> 19:46.733
AND... LOVE GONE BAD, MAN.

19:46.833 --> 19:48.467
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

19:49.633 --> 19:50.667
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.333
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.100
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.133
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:55.233 --> 19:58.200
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.567 --> 20:05.500
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.100
-(theme music playing)
