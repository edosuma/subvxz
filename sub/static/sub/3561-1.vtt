03:38.018 --> 03:42.272
<i>I never knew my parents.
The only thing I ever knew was Prescott.</i>

03:42.939 --> 03:45.592
<i>It was a top-secret
government-run school</i>

03:45.692 --> 03:49.654
<i>that turned little girls
into killing machines.</i>

03:50.989 --> 03:53.450
Not bad. Run it again.

04:04.711 --> 04:08.448
Back of the line, grandma.
97, you're up!

04:08.548 --> 04:12.677
Move! Time trial starts
in three, two, one...

04:13.804 --> 04:18.375
<i>Hardman, the head of Prescott,
had some unique ideas about education.</i>

04:18.475 --> 04:23.188
It's all about putting holes
in the subject.

04:23.313 --> 04:27.025
- <i>See what I mean?</i>
- Ladies, prepare to spring some leaks.

04:27.150 --> 04:31.221
Engage. It's all about
vulnerability. Eyes...

04:31.321 --> 04:33.223
<i>Now, we may have all been orphans,</i>

04:33.323 --> 04:35.367
<i>but we were never allowed
to become a family.</i>

04:35.742 --> 04:38.353
Carotid arteries.

04:38.453 --> 04:40.288
Pens up!

04:45.752 --> 04:50.615
To be a Prescott is to be an island.

04:50.715 --> 04:54.661
It is you and you alone out there.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.956
- What do we say, ladies?
- No attachments!

04:58.056 --> 05:02.561
No... attachments.

05:04.312 --> 05:07.382
<i>Yeah, that part never
sounded right to me.</i>

05:07.482 --> 05:11.278
- Engage!
- <i>But I was good at everything else.</i>

05:11.820 --> 05:14.489
<i>The best, actually.</i>

05:15.448 --> 05:18.034
<i>As much as I wanted to make friends,</i>

05:18.243 --> 05:20.103
<i>that was just never gonna happen here.</i>

05:20.203 --> 05:22.414
Begin.

05:22.539 --> 05:27.252
Bad intentions, ladies. Bad intentions.

05:27.377 --> 05:30.171
Every punch has a purpose.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.783
Strike and move. Strike and move.

05:33.883 --> 05:35.619
Flow.

05:35.719 --> 05:38.455
Elbows, knees. React.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.459
Hammer fist, ladies.
You're not training to save your lives.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.687
You're training to take someone else's.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.154
Bitch.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.850
<i>I was the first one
in my class to be activated.</i>

05:58.950 --> 06:02.746
<i>As usual, 84 didn't take it well.</i>

06:07.625 --> 06:10.904
<i>It takes a certain mindset
to do this kind of work.</i>

06:11.004 --> 06:13.506
<i>That's why they get to us so young.</i>

06:13.631 --> 06:17.552
<i>Plus, who would ever suspect a kid?</i>

06:20.096 --> 06:21.765
<i>Not this guy.</i>

06:27.312 --> 06:30.982
<i>What can I say? He trained us well.</i>

06:37.489 --> 06:40.075
<i>Sure, I got to see the world...</i>

06:41.951 --> 06:44.454
<i>but what I couldn't help notice</i>

06:44.871 --> 06:48.917
<i>was this whole other world
I was missing.</i>

06:56.883 --> 07:02.138
<i>I wanted to know what normal kids did,
so I started gathering Intel.</i>

07:46.641 --> 07:50.728
Meet Victoria Knox:
American expat turned arms dealer.

07:50.854 --> 07:53.256
If you're a terrorist
and you want to kill some folk,

07:53.356 --> 07:55.650
this is the person you call.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.569
Don't let her good looks fool you.

07:57.694 --> 08:02.265
She has an I.Q. of 140,
and she will use it to kill you.

08:02.365 --> 08:06.019
She was last seen in Corsica
three years ago,

08:06.119 --> 08:09.063
until she resurfaced eight hours ago,

08:09.163 --> 08:11.916
and will probably be gone in eight more,

08:12.041 --> 08:14.711
unless we bring her in.

08:14.836 --> 08:16.504
Correction:

08:16.921 --> 08:19.657
Unless you catch her, Agent 83,

08:19.757 --> 08:22.176
- and bring her in, alive.
- Wait, what?

08:22.302 --> 08:26.514
- Simmer down. You're B-team, 84.
- B-team? This should be my mission.

08:26.639 --> 08:31.252
I studied the case file. She's over there
sniffing Kesha, the new fragrance by Kesha.

08:31.352 --> 08:33.563
I said simmer...

08:39.652 --> 08:44.699
You need to get your head
in the game, Agent 83,

08:44.824 --> 08:49.537
because Victoria Knox will take it off.

08:51.080 --> 08:56.361
If we follow the profile,
everyone will come home safely.

08:56.461 --> 09:01.966
- And remember, we're not in...
- In the rescue business.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.761
What she said.

09:05.386 --> 09:09.098
Gear up. We're wheels up in one hour.

09:17.231 --> 09:18.858
<i>Knox was a legend.</i>

09:18.983 --> 09:21.761
<i>Ruthless, vindictive...</i>

09:21.861 --> 09:24.347
<i>and she had a thing
for taking out Prescotts.</i>

09:24.447 --> 09:26.491
Got some bad news: You're dead.

09:26.616 --> 09:29.285
Hey, guys.

09:30.078 --> 09:33.064
- You make them comfortable?
- 36 hours alone in the box.

09:33.164 --> 09:36.834
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

09:36.959 --> 09:41.631
Copenhagen? Hi, peek-a-boo.
Copenhagen's mine.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.719
Johannesburg, remember me?

09:46.844 --> 09:51.432
Like having a gun to your face?
Feels good, doesn't it?

09:53.142 --> 09:56.938
And you... finally got you.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.776
- Gotcha.
- You got nothing, kid.

11:03.421 --> 11:05.798
What do you plan to do with that?

11:07.341 --> 11:11.804
Still playing dress-up
with 007-year-olds?

11:13.598 --> 11:16.225
- Where is she?
- You missing someone?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.087
- You mad at me?
- Let's just say

11:20.187 --> 11:22.799
I'm a little disappointed
with your life choices.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.067
Sit her ass down somewhere.

11:26.777 --> 11:30.197
- Hi. What's your name?
- 83, come back.

11:45.713 --> 11:49.925
83, come in if you hear me.
Give us a visual, anything.

11:50.051 --> 11:52.161
83.

11:52.261 --> 11:54.747
<i>Sign me, come in.</i>

11:54.847 --> 11:58.334
<i>83, come in. Give us a sign
you're down there.</i>

11:58.434 --> 12:00.853
<i>I didn't plan for it
to turn out like this,</i>

12:00.978 --> 12:03.422
<i>but there was no turning back now.</i>

12:03.522 --> 12:06.108
<i>This was my chance to escape.</i>

12:06.817 --> 12:11.030
<i>83, this is your last chance.</i>

12:12.323 --> 12:17.578
Sir, no visual, no audio.
She's not responding.

12:23.334 --> 12:25.127
Mark it.

12:25.252 --> 12:28.881
83... inactive.

12:49.819 --> 12:53.781
<i>I couldn't believe it.
Mission high school was a go.</i>

13:30.276 --> 13:32.386
Last chance to back out.

13:32.486 --> 13:36.448
- Foreign exchange student was your idea.
- Yeah, six years ago.

13:37.741 --> 13:39.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.620
Hi, I'm Megan.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.025
- Do we hug?
- What do you do in your family?

13:46.125 --> 13:48.319
- It's different there.
- Hugs are good.

13:48.419 --> 13:50.696
- Okay.
- Hi. I'm Penny.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.965
- Hi.
- This is Parker.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.867
Hey, Parker.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.620
- This is Liz.
- Of course.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.471
No, don't touch me
till I've seen your papers.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.624
- Elizabeth.
- What?

14:01.724 --> 14:04.335
- Mr. Larson, hey!
- Oh, my good...

14:04.435 --> 14:07.313
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. Excuse us.

14:07.438 --> 14:10.883
Oh, is he... I... I saw in the profile,
the picture of all of you.

14:10.983 --> 14:15.304
No, no, no, it's okay. It's just
the three of us. I'm divorced.

14:15.404 --> 14:17.264
- Sorry.
- But I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:17.364 --> 14:20.701
We are fine. You know,
even better, actually, you know.

14:20.826 --> 14:24.480
Some people make it work. Others, you know,
they run off with a pharmaceutical rep

14:24.580 --> 14:27.233
and spend your life savings
on a pontoon boat.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.961
But we're good, so...
are your parents still together?

14:31.086 --> 14:33.297
Mine are dead.

14:34.089 --> 14:35.966
I'll get the car.

15:23.806 --> 15:27.559
Well, I think what you're doing
is very brave.

15:27.851 --> 15:30.671
Adjusting to a new culture is hard.

15:30.771 --> 15:36.385
You know what else is hard?
Ninja training. But I do it anyway.

15:36.485 --> 15:40.989
- Is that how you hurt your arm?
- Nope, fell off his bike.

15:41.115 --> 15:42.224
It was ninja training.

15:42.324 --> 15:45.644
Okay, and I guess Dad's just gonna
pontoon back any day now too?

15:45.744 --> 15:48.689
Okay, Elizabeth...
let's not ruin dinner.

15:48.789 --> 15:52.151
- I'm a shadow warrior.
- Yeah? That's cool.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.545
I'm a secret agent.

15:55.629 --> 15:58.782
Well, if there's anything
that's special that you'd like to do,

15:58.882 --> 16:02.261
you know, you can just make a list,
and I'm sure Lizzy would be thrilled,

16:02.386 --> 16:05.414
thrilled to show you.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

16:05.514 --> 16:07.541
I would love to take the school bus.

16:07.641 --> 16:10.919
- Peter Dinardo pooped on the bus.
- Okay, Parker.

16:11.019 --> 16:12.146
- What?
- No poop.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.757
I know a poop when I see one.
You can't fight with that.

16:14.857 --> 16:20.696
One, that's disgusting.
Two, I am not riding the bus.

16:20.863 --> 16:23.140
But it's a quintessential
high school experience.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.992
So is mono.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.707
What is mono?

16:31.999 --> 16:34.777
Kids get it from kissing.
It's like mouth aids.

16:34.877 --> 16:38.172
You seriously just ruined my appetite.

16:47.097 --> 16:49.308
Hey. You have everything you need?

16:49.433 --> 16:51.668
Yeah, just prepping.

16:51.768 --> 16:54.813
Is transpo still at zero seven hundred?

16:55.189 --> 16:57.925
- Transpo?
- The bus, sorry.

16:58.025 --> 17:00.277
Oh, yeah, no,
it usually rolls by at 7:00.

17:00.402 --> 17:03.030
Okay, got it.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.907
You know, we're really glad you're here.

17:06.617 --> 17:10.494
- Thanks. Me too.
- Okay.

17:11.579 --> 17:14.082
Good night.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.962
Okay.

17:22.925 --> 17:26.386
Normal 16-year-old, normal 16-year-old.

17:49.076 --> 17:50.160
Fresh meat.

17:55.123 --> 17:56.541
Oh, my God.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.503
Jeez...

17:59.628 --> 18:01.713
Freak show! What do you want from me?

18:01.838 --> 18:04.741
- I thought we could walk together.
- Are you on bath salts?

18:04.841 --> 18:08.620
It's like you have social herpes and you
want to... spit it back in my mouth.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.040
- That's... that's really gross.
- So is your makeup.

18:12.140 --> 18:15.477
God, you look like you had
a one-night stand with Mr. Potato Head.

18:15.602 --> 18:19.314
Look, I have nine months, three weeks,
and five days until I escape

18:19.439 --> 18:23.735
this post-pubescent psych ward,
and you are not gonna mess this up.

18:24.611 --> 18:26.430
Just...

18:26.530 --> 18:28.657
wipe all that off,

18:28.782 --> 18:31.159
put these on, and just...

18:31.576 --> 18:34.830
try not to talk to me. Okay?

18:43.463 --> 18:47.409
Welcome, Vikings. Hey, everyone.
Now, let's see some school spirit.

18:47.509 --> 18:52.305
Come on, spell it with me.
Come on, V-I-K-I... okay.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.890
- Okay.
- I'm gonna spell it by myself?

18:54.015 --> 18:59.296
All right, well, I have great news.
Our campus is now a nut-free zone.

18:59.396 --> 19:02.466
- Yeah, finally!
- Absolutely, Gooch. That's right.

19:02.566 --> 19:05.761
As long as I'm principal,
you will never see another student

19:05.861 --> 19:08.572
- with nuts in their mouth.
- No promises!

19:10.407 --> 19:12.517
It's gonna be a long year, I see.

19:12.617 --> 19:17.080
I'm also excited because,
for the first time,

19:17.205 --> 19:19.207
Newton High School is participating

19:19.332 --> 19:22.736
in a brand-new foreign
student exchange program.

19:22.836 --> 19:26.089
You know we need more diversity. We only
have two Cambodians and one Mexican.

19:26.381 --> 19:28.842
I take it this is your first assembly.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.537
Yeah. Isn't this awesome?

19:32.637 --> 19:35.682
Not usually. But okay.

19:37.225 --> 19:38.894
Are you a member of the band?

19:39.019 --> 19:41.021
No, I'm actually more
on the engineering side.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.840
I do the lighting board and design.

19:43.940 --> 19:47.886
Oh, look at that.
So that's your thing, then.

19:47.986 --> 19:51.306
A/V geek. I got it, I got it.
I saw "10 Things I Hate About You".

19:51.406 --> 19:53.308
Right, yeah. No, it's just like that.

19:53.408 --> 19:55.894
- Right, I figured.
- Only not the '90s.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.897
You know, just...
whatever happens out there,

19:58.997 --> 20:01.733
- don't let 'em get to you.
- Right.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.793
All right, well, please join me
in welcoming

20:04.002 --> 20:08.465
our foreign exchange student,
all the way from exotic...

20:10.175 --> 20:12.636
Oh, come on, man. Canada? For real?

20:12.761 --> 20:16.806
Please put your hands together
for Megan Walsh.

20:16.932 --> 20:18.667
- That's you.
- Yeah, that's me.

20:18.767 --> 20:22.062
Show her some love, Megan Walsh.
Come on, Vikings, make some noise.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.256
- Yeah!
- Come on, people.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.233
Thank you.

20:26.608 --> 20:30.612
Hey, guys, I'm Megan.
I'm from Regina, Saskatchewan.

20:30.737 --> 20:34.407
I'm really psyched to join the long
and proud legacy of Viking alumni.

20:34.532 --> 20:37.602
- Hey, did you say Regina?
- Yeah, Saskatchewan.

20:37.702 --> 20:41.148
- Go back to Regina!
- Okay, Gooch.

20:41.248 --> 20:44.417
- Canada sucks a dick!
- What are your pajamas all "aboot"?

20:44.542 --> 20:48.446
- Why are you here? Go home!
- No, no, guys... please.

20:48.546 --> 20:51.508
Take back Bieber. Take back Bieber!

20:51.675 --> 20:55.679
- Take back Bieber!
- Stop, stop, stop.

20:59.432 --> 21:04.062
<i>Megan from Canada</i>

21:09.275 --> 21:12.237
<i>I'm just a simple...</i>

21:12.362 --> 21:14.239
<i>man-ada</i>

21:14.739 --> 21:17.100
Cash!

21:17.200 --> 21:21.897
<i>I could change all my plan-adas</i>

21:21.997 --> 21:26.693
<i>If your smile walked in on me</i>

21:26.793 --> 21:29.087
Megan from Canada, everyone.

21:32.507 --> 21:34.284
Hey, they can be a tough crowd.

21:34.384 --> 21:36.302
Don't worry about it;
You're gonna be nickel.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.289
- Thanks.
- Totem pole.

21:39.389 --> 21:42.058
Totem pole.

21:43.435 --> 21:47.172
Thank you. What an entrance.
What an entrance.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.549
Okay, let's give it up
for a little rock group

21:49.649 --> 21:54.012
that was number 24 on the iTunes
download list back in March,

21:54.112 --> 21:58.199
Newton High's own... Emotacon!

22:07.333 --> 22:10.003
<i>Dark day, I can't get no sleep</i>

22:10.128 --> 22:14.157
<i>Because something's got a hold over me</i>

22:14.257 --> 22:17.160
<i>Voices in my head racing through my head</i>

22:17.260 --> 22:21.431
<i>Keep me up
I don't know which one to believe</i>

22:21.556 --> 22:25.043
<i>This water fell for miles</i>

22:25.143 --> 22:29.022
<i>But there's still so far I have to go...</i>

22:35.737 --> 22:38.932
- There she is.
- Hey, Megan. Hi, I'm Missy.

22:39.032 --> 22:44.037
I am so sorry about that behavior
at assembly. Kids can be so cruel.

22:45.288 --> 22:48.291
- Want to join us?
- Come sit, come sit.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.962
Sure. Thanks, I...

22:56.132 --> 22:57.659
Pom-poms?

22:57.759 --> 23:00.203
- You're cheerleaders, aren't you?
- Oh, absolutely.

23:00.303 --> 23:02.680
- I know what angle you're running.
- Angle?

23:02.805 --> 23:05.417
- Oh, I've seen "Mean Girls", twice.
- Okay.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.420
You're gonna invite me to sit, then weaken
my defenses, and then embarrass me

23:08.520 --> 23:11.064
in some elaborate prank
to assert your social dominance.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.817
- What?
- Nice try.

23:16.319 --> 23:17.487
I thought we were nice.

23:20.406 --> 23:23.826
Gooch, enough with the paper airplanes.

23:23.952 --> 23:25.687
Welcome back, welcome back.

23:25.787 --> 23:28.081
First day blues, I get it.
All right, take your seats.

23:28.581 --> 23:32.877
Put your books on your tables
and open them up to the first page.

23:33.795 --> 23:35.572
- No, no, Gooch!
- Yeah.

23:35.672 --> 23:37.198
- Gooch.
- Sorry.

23:37.298 --> 23:42.495
Why can't you be more like Cash?
See? He's got his book out, right?

23:42.595 --> 23:43.788
- Hi.
- You need a seat?

23:43.888 --> 23:47.350
- Look at my beautiful boy.
- Megan from Canada, right?

23:47.475 --> 23:50.478
- Love that mouth.
- A/V geek?

23:50.603 --> 23:53.314
Yeah, well, it's Roger.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.485
All right, here.

23:58.152 --> 24:00.780
- You hungry?
- Nope.

24:01.281 --> 24:03.516
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

24:03.616 --> 24:06.202
- I guess you didn't need that.
- Yeah.

24:07.620 --> 24:11.833
Oh, no. I hope
he didn't "Kermit" suicide.

24:12.834 --> 24:16.129
I heard this class is "ribbiting."

24:20.508 --> 24:25.388
Well, I wouldn't "leap" to conclusions.
Mr. Drumm can be pretty rough.

24:25.513 --> 24:28.308
Hey! New girl! Focus!

24:29.308 --> 24:31.561
Told you so.

24:34.230 --> 24:36.357
Okay, hey...

24:36.733 --> 24:39.510
I know everybody got to sit
with their buddies today,

24:39.610 --> 24:42.347
but I'm the one
who chooses the lab partners.

24:42.447 --> 24:46.059
So tomorrow the seating chart
shall be up,

24:46.159 --> 24:49.687
and we'll have a wonderful time.
Now, get out of here!

24:49.787 --> 24:52.690
I'm not kidding. Get out of here. Go.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.418
It was nice knowing you.

25:00.757 --> 25:05.828
Hold on there, mister. Hold on there.
I know what you're doing after school.

25:05.928 --> 25:08.681
- What?
- You're jammin' with me.

25:08.806 --> 25:12.101
You know, I play a little slide trombone.
You know slide trombone.

25:16.230 --> 25:18.733
Yeah. Let's jam.

25:18.858 --> 25:21.319
- Sure.
- Let's have a sesh. All right.

25:21.444 --> 25:22.470
- Cool.
- I like your spunk.

25:22.570 --> 25:25.239
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

25:25.948 --> 25:27.158
Oh, Canada...

25:58.523 --> 26:01.008
Okay, I'll be here at 4:00
to pick you up.

26:01.108 --> 26:03.720
I'll text you if I'm running late.
You do the same, okay?

26:03.820 --> 26:06.681
- Yep.
- I want to know your 20 every 20.

26:06.781 --> 26:09.283
But no 4:20.

26:09.784 --> 26:11.727
I'm serious.

26:11.827 --> 26:13.521
What am I talking about?

26:13.621 --> 26:15.873
You're talking about weed?

26:15.998 --> 26:17.150
How do you know that?

26:17.250 --> 26:19.694
- What do you mean? Because...
- What are you, Harold and Kumar?

26:19.794 --> 26:22.405
No, I'm a teenager,
and I go to high school, so...

26:22.505 --> 26:25.575
- I'm not saying that I smoke weed...
- Don't. It's a gateway drug.

26:25.675 --> 26:29.871
It is a gateway drug. You smoke
weed, and then, guess what,

26:29.971 --> 26:33.349
meth... equals death.

26:34.016 --> 26:36.644
Crack is whack. Coke's no joke.

26:37.019 --> 26:40.506
So how it all rhymes like that?
It's like a poem about dying from drugs.

26:40.606 --> 26:42.775
Hey, I got to go, okay?

26:43.776 --> 26:47.930
Also, hash is very bad for you,
'cause it's more intense than weed.

26:48.030 --> 26:52.076
It's, like, really compact, and you'll
freak out. I had a major freak-out.

26:54.078 --> 26:57.440
Okay, hey, hello.

26:57.540 --> 27:00.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.404
It's so funny we ended up together.

27:03.504 --> 27:07.992
Yeah, biology's kind of tricky,
and you seem really smart.

27:08.092 --> 27:10.845
Yeah, it's definitely a good match.

27:11.887 --> 27:15.808
Hi. I think you're in my seat. Hi, Cash.

27:16.142 --> 27:19.503
You're in her seat. Hi, Cash.

27:19.603 --> 27:22.006
Trust me. I'm at station six.

27:22.106 --> 27:25.318
Yeah, no. I'm pretty sure I'm there.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.678
Did everybody find their seats okay?

27:27.778 --> 27:29.680
Come on, Canada, out of my seat.

27:29.780 --> 27:34.243
Every year, I pick a very special
someone to be my lab assistant.

27:34.618 --> 27:38.122
And guess what, who's it gonna be?
Eenie, meenie, miney... Cash.

27:38.247 --> 27:43.152
Come this way, brother.
Struttin' like a rock star.

27:43.252 --> 27:45.921
And you two females,
you can be partners.

27:46.047 --> 27:48.783
Have fun with Regina.

27:48.883 --> 27:52.344
Cold, hard Cash. Get over here, mister.

28:03.898 --> 28:05.341
Megan, hi.

28:05.441 --> 28:07.943
I couldn't help noticing
you're into Cash?

28:08.069 --> 28:13.057
I don't blame you. If I wasn't such a
strict vegan, I'd be, like, all over that.

28:13.157 --> 28:14.600
Tell me about it.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.395
So ironic, though,
all of those groupies and sluts

28:17.495 --> 28:21.649
- that constantly hang all over him.
- Yeah, they're not even his type.

28:21.749 --> 28:25.127
- What is his type?
- Girls who like dressing up.

28:25.252 --> 28:26.988
Like models?

28:27.088 --> 28:29.673
Not even close.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.301
Mascots.

28:32.426 --> 28:35.329
All my high school research suggests
that they're awkward loners,

28:35.429 --> 28:38.082
not musical enough for the band,
too uncoordinated for track.

28:38.182 --> 28:42.044
I know it sounds weird, but school spirit,
it's, like, really big here.

28:42.144 --> 28:44.588
And Cash loves school spirit.

28:44.688 --> 28:47.483
Yeah, why do you think Emotacon
performs at, like, every pep rally?

28:47.608 --> 28:49.385
- School spirit.
- Yeah, I mean, who wants to be

28:49.485 --> 28:51.904
some rando screaming at him
from the audience?

28:52.029 --> 28:54.890
- I wouldn't.
- But mascots, they go backstage.

28:54.990 --> 28:58.577
- They go backstage.
- You would have him all to yourself.

28:58.702 --> 29:01.455
- Mano a mano.
- Mano a mascot.

29:01.580 --> 29:04.400
But you should hurry 'cause you don't
want somebody else to get that spot.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.045
- Yeah, like, totem pole.
- Totem pole.

29:10.548 --> 29:12.508
Great, thanks.

29:24.645 --> 29:25.813
Yeah.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.244
- How'd I do?
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

29:57.344 --> 30:00.556
- A lot of spirit. Job's all yours.
- Yes.

30:00.681 --> 30:04.560
95, 96, 97, 98, 99...

30:04.685 --> 30:06.812
1,000.

30:27.249 --> 30:31.237
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

30:31.337 --> 30:34.423
and sorry I could not travel both..."

30:38.385 --> 30:41.930
Megan. Care to join us?

30:42.514 --> 30:45.960
Two paths in the woods.
Probably an ambush.

30:46.060 --> 30:47.962
I'd wait until nightfall when they're
asleep and vulnerable,

30:48.062 --> 30:49.938
then advance inside a tree line,

30:50.064 --> 30:54.234
maybe rig a trip wire in case
he's trying to double back.

30:55.694 --> 31:01.283
Okay. Well, Liz... I'd be locking
my door tonight if I were you.

31:02.368 --> 31:05.938
- Sweet answer, weirdo.
- And anyone else?

31:06.038 --> 31:09.333
Whatever that was,
but minus the serial killer part of it.

31:21.095 --> 31:23.180
Move.

31:27.935 --> 31:29.728
Go, team, go!

31:53.460 --> 31:55.821
What are you doing? Who sent you?

31:55.921 --> 31:57.740
- I surrender! I surrender!
- Who are you?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.175
I'm Leonard Steinman.
I'm a sophomore at Lincoln.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.412
Just wanted to hold
the mascot ransom. It's tradition.

32:03.512 --> 32:06.473
- Kidnapping is a high school tradition?
- Yeah.

32:07.975 --> 32:09.935
High school tradition.

32:17.568 --> 32:20.529
Not the face, not the face.

32:21.029 --> 32:22.990
Sweet moves, Canada.

32:24.283 --> 32:27.978
Hey, Megan. Hey.

32:28.078 --> 32:30.289
You all right?

32:31.498 --> 32:34.418
Really lost your head out there.

32:35.878 --> 32:38.171
I got to go.

32:40.048 --> 32:42.217
I'm sorry.

32:49.057 --> 32:50.559
Oh, God.

32:53.020 --> 32:54.688
- There he is.
- Yup.

32:54.813 --> 32:56.507
- How we doing, sport?
- Good.

32:56.607 --> 33:00.485
All right. Who... who's the girl there?

33:01.445 --> 33:04.197
- She's just a new student.
- Yeah, all right.

33:04.323 --> 33:06.850
- But you think she's cute, right?
- Yeah.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.619
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's really cute.

33:08.910 --> 33:11.580
What do you call 'em, like, a hottie?
Is that... what do you... is it a...

33:11.705 --> 33:14.942
A hottie biscotti? No.

33:15.042 --> 33:19.321
- You just say, like, "oh, she's hot."
- Yeah, yeah. Just like a babe.

33:19.421 --> 33:21.365
- Yeah.
- Or you say, like, a bitch?

33:21.465 --> 33:24.635
- Like, "hey, look at this bitch."
- No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say that.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.762
- That's so rude.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

33:26.887 --> 33:28.455
- Can we just go home?
- Yep.

33:28.555 --> 33:31.933
But, you know, your old man is here to talk
if you want to talk about anything at all.

33:32.059 --> 33:34.936
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

33:35.062 --> 33:38.273
Like sex or... intercourse, or...

33:38.398 --> 33:40.651
- Let's go, Dad.
- Let's go.

33:41.735 --> 33:44.763
Oh, come on, 83, think.

33:44.863 --> 33:47.741
Fall back on your training.
Stick to the profile.

33:50.243 --> 33:52.746
This profile's all wrong!

33:52.871 --> 33:55.816
- What's going on, honey?
- All this Intel, it's wrong.

33:55.916 --> 33:59.194
I can never show my face again.
I've got it all wrong, all wrong.

33:59.294 --> 34:01.380
It's everything, I...

34:02.297 --> 34:04.408
It's like I'm suffocating.

34:04.508 --> 34:07.094
Simulated drowning, that, I can...
that, I can deal with.

34:07.219 --> 34:10.746
Just... this stuff is so much worse.

34:10.847 --> 34:15.143
I can't... I can't do it. I can't take
another second of it. It's just... it's...

34:15.268 --> 34:19.106
It's high school. That's all it is.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.275
Hey, look. Come here.

34:22.692 --> 34:24.678
You know...

34:24.777 --> 34:28.447
Some thrive, and it's
the best years of their lives.

34:28.572 --> 34:30.726
Others...

34:30.826 --> 34:33.786
Others spend four years being mocked
for wearing a thick black ribbon

34:33.911 --> 34:36.873
in their hair like Madonna
in the "Lucky" star video.

34:37.541 --> 34:40.193
- What?
- Oh, Google it.

34:40.293 --> 34:41.737
But we suffer through it,

34:41.837 --> 34:45.549
not because we're being strong
or staying true to our personal style,

34:45.674 --> 34:49.745
but because taking that ribbon off
would mean revealing to those bastards

34:49.844 --> 34:53.290
the tiny bald spot we were hiding
in the first place.

34:53.389 --> 34:55.058
Hypothetically.

34:55.976 --> 34:58.879
Look, what you're feeling is normal.

34:58.979 --> 35:02.107
High school is a conflicting time.

35:02.232 --> 35:03.925
Okay.

35:04.025 --> 35:06.319
Parental advice terminated.

35:07.904 --> 35:11.950
Bring it in. Give me a hug. Okay.

35:13.493 --> 35:16.204
Stop. I had it taken care of years ago.

35:24.171 --> 35:27.449
- I hope you've enjoyed our hospitality.
- It's all right.

35:27.549 --> 35:30.285
All you got to do is give me
the name of your supplier.

35:30.385 --> 35:33.079
I'll see to it you rot here in dignity.

35:33.179 --> 35:37.809
Showers once a week.
That "L Word" box set.

35:37.934 --> 35:41.479
- French toast on Sundays.
- That's really nice of you.

35:41.605 --> 35:43.256
We both know everybody talks.

35:43.356 --> 35:47.761
We also both know
that I'm not just anybody...

35:47.861 --> 35:49.779
am I, Dumbledore?

35:55.160 --> 35:57.229
If you played your cards right,

35:57.329 --> 35:59.731
we might even let you come back
and play for the good guys.

35:59.831 --> 36:02.500
The good guys?

36:02.626 --> 36:07.364
- You destroy lives.
- Only those that need to be destroyed.

36:07.464 --> 36:10.383
I'm not talking about the targets.

36:10.842 --> 36:14.304
Sir, I have something
you need to... but, sir...

36:20.560 --> 36:22.671
She's cute.

36:22.771 --> 36:25.106
Last chance to talk.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.676
Fine.

36:27.776 --> 36:31.613
- Don't go anywhere.
- Yeah, I'll be right here.

36:32.280 --> 36:37.077
You know what I like about
the people I do business with?

36:38.036 --> 36:41.039
They know they're assholes.

36:41.706 --> 36:44.000
Something funny?

36:48.713 --> 36:51.132
You'll regret this.

37:07.232 --> 37:09.275
She's here.

37:11.111 --> 37:13.154
Yeah!

37:19.661 --> 37:22.564
- What's going on?
- Is that a joke?

37:22.664 --> 37:25.959
85,000 views since just last night.

37:27.544 --> 37:30.505
- I'm viral?
- Like HPV.

37:30.630 --> 37:32.298
Even rape-it Ralph is a fan.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.617
Dude, check this out.
This guy's about to get trombonered.

37:34.717 --> 37:37.537
Just like... right there. Damn!

37:37.637 --> 37:39.914
She showed those d-bags from Lincoln.

37:40.014 --> 37:42.876
Hey, this is why you don't mess
with us Vikings.

37:42.976 --> 37:45.979
- Hell yeah!
- Regina, Regina,

37:46.104 --> 37:50.150
Regina, Regina, Regina...

37:51.151 --> 37:55.305
Whatever. She's gonna get
really fat in college.

37:55.405 --> 37:58.700
I don't get it. I'm on camera
acting bat-shit psycho.

37:58.825 --> 38:02.704
That's usually
what gets people trending.

38:03.121 --> 38:07.192
No, no, no. I can't be on the Internet.
That's bad, Liz. That's really bad.

38:07.292 --> 38:09.319
There you are.

38:09.419 --> 38:11.946
So... we're jammin' this weekend.

38:12.046 --> 38:14.591
Why don't you stop by?

38:17.802 --> 38:20.346
Yeah, sure.

38:20.930 --> 38:23.583
- Sounds nickel.
- Nickel?

38:23.683 --> 38:25.685
- Awesome, catch you then.
- Catch you then.

38:29.606 --> 38:33.134
Obviously not all bad.

38:33.234 --> 38:35.970
Look, you may have
all of these people fooled,

38:36.070 --> 38:40.241
but you and I both know that you are
sketchier than a 2:00 a.m. waffle house.

39:06.726 --> 39:11.005
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
You really shouldn't sneak up on people.

39:11.105 --> 39:13.316
It's totally my mistake.

39:14.150 --> 39:16.152
Okay.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.558
- Sorry.
- Welcome.

39:21.658 --> 39:24.452
Thanks. This place is really cool.

39:33.878 --> 39:36.072
Got some ice.

39:36.172 --> 39:38.716
Thank you so much.

39:40.259 --> 39:44.514
You know, I'm not... I'm not as fragile
as my easy takedown would suggest.

39:44.639 --> 39:47.208
You caught me off guard.
Usually I can defend myself.

39:47.308 --> 39:51.270
- I did notice that inner buffness, I did.
- Oh, thanks.

39:51.729 --> 39:55.967
So you're on pace to beat Emotacon's
last video release? That's pretty cool.

39:56.067 --> 39:59.304
- Yeah, how do you turn off the Internet?
- Really?

39:59.404 --> 40:02.098
You know, a lot of people would kill
for that kind of attention.

40:02.198 --> 40:05.018
Yeah, I don't know. I just
prefer to stay below the radar.

40:05.118 --> 40:08.121
Okay, so maybe you steer clear
of anymore taekwondo smackdowns?

40:08.246 --> 40:10.748
That was actually more a mix
of krav maga and aikido.

40:10.873 --> 40:12.483
Taewondo is what I just did on you.

40:12.583 --> 40:16.337
But when faced
with multiple opponents, it's...

40:16.963 --> 40:18.965
- What?
- You're weird.

40:19.090 --> 40:21.743
Yeah, but I like it. It's cool.

40:21.843 --> 40:24.846
Were your parents
in the military or something?

40:26.597 --> 40:28.558
Sor... "are parents" a bad topic?

40:28.683 --> 40:32.962
They both died when I was really young.
I was raised by a foster family.

40:33.062 --> 40:37.358
- Sorry, I had no idea. I'm stupid.
- No, it's fine. How would you have known?

40:37.483 --> 40:39.735
I don't know. Well, I'm sorry.

40:39.861 --> 40:42.488
Just don't let it happen again,
or you might need more icepacks.

40:42.613 --> 40:44.974
Oh, yeah, Lara croft?
You know what? I want a rematch.

40:45.074 --> 40:46.200
- Do you?
- Yeah, put 'em up.

40:46.325 --> 40:47.660
All right.

40:48.661 --> 40:51.814
Pop. Here, hit it.

40:51.914 --> 40:55.418
- Really? I don't want to hurt you.
- Yeah. Okay, come on.

40:55.626 --> 40:57.945
- It hurts. It stings. I need the ice.
- Get the ice.

40:58.045 --> 41:00.631
Rogerito... are we set up?

41:02.049 --> 41:04.510
Yeah. Just give me one second.

41:04.927 --> 41:07.263
I could just...

41:07.388 --> 41:08.514
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:08.639 --> 41:10.792
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Me too.

41:10.892 --> 41:13.060
Do you think you could do me a favor?

41:13.186 --> 41:16.606
- I could try.
- Yeah? Come on.

41:24.822 --> 41:30.311
So I'm working on this new song,
but I'm just so inside of it.

41:30.411 --> 41:33.022
I could use an honest opinion,
if you don't mind.

41:33.122 --> 41:34.957
No.

41:37.919 --> 41:41.088
It's pretty rough, so... be gentle.

41:46.469 --> 41:48.054
<i>You</i>

41:48.763 --> 41:52.041
<i>In the back of my head
Oh, I can feel your face</i>

41:52.141 --> 41:56.354
<i>But I can't hold it</i>

41:56.479 --> 41:59.899
<i>I still believe</i>

42:00.024 --> 42:02.135
<i>Smoke</i>

42:02.235 --> 42:05.279
<i>At the back of my throat
Oh, I can smell your scent</i>

42:05.404 --> 42:09.559
<i>But I can't hold you</i>

42:09.659 --> 42:12.311
<i>And it's Saturday and I thought</i>

42:12.411 --> 42:18.000
<i>So I say take me
Take me down to the water</i>

42:24.548 --> 42:26.909
- You're handling it pretty well.
- What's that?

42:27.009 --> 42:30.638
The fame monster. She can be a beast.

42:30.763 --> 42:32.390
So...

42:32.515 --> 42:35.960
It's nice talking to someone who
understands the pressure. Thanks.

42:36.060 --> 42:39.922
Yeah. No, that's... that's me.

42:40.022 --> 42:42.108
Pressure understander.

42:47.738 --> 42:50.074
You know, that guard
totally would have seen you.

42:50.199 --> 42:52.618
- No way. I was in stealth mode.
- Stealth mode?

42:52.743 --> 42:55.313
A compound like this
would have counter-Intel out its ears.

42:55.413 --> 42:57.164
Motion sensors, hyperspectral imaging.

42:57.289 --> 42:59.150
There's no way you could
just tiptoe down the hall.

42:59.250 --> 43:02.278
A high-value target is never gonna be
vulnerable to a face-to-face takedown.

43:02.378 --> 43:04.947
- He's not?
- No, look, you've got to engineer

43:05.047 --> 43:06.532
a passive campaign of mental anguish,

43:06.632 --> 43:09.619
basically alienating the target
from those closest to him.

43:09.719 --> 43:14.014
He'll withdraw, paranoia and suspicion
grow, and eventually he'll just kill himself.

43:14.265 --> 43:18.185
I'm not sure if there's
a button for that.

43:19.311 --> 43:21.547
Right...

43:21.647 --> 43:25.025
Just choke him out
with that lamp cord, then.

43:26.235 --> 43:29.572
Nickel. Thanks, babe.

43:35.244 --> 43:38.289
- I should... I should probably get going.
- Yeah, no doubt.

43:38.414 --> 43:41.359
But, hey, listen, before you bounce,
Gooch's 'rents are out of town,

43:41.459 --> 43:44.153
so we're throwing down this Friday.
You got to be there.

43:44.253 --> 43:46.989
Are you serious?
Parents-away-in-Europe party?

43:47.089 --> 43:49.842
Oh, my God, this day
cannot get any better.

43:50.593 --> 43:53.746
Pittsburgh, I think.
But Gooch's parties are legendary.

43:53.846 --> 43:56.056
You down?

43:56.182 --> 43:59.643
Down. I'm down, yeah. Nickel.

43:59.768 --> 44:01.479
- Totem pole.
- Totem pole.

44:23.876 --> 44:26.420
Greetings, 83.

44:29.423 --> 44:32.301
- Good evening, 83.
- How did you find me?

44:32.426 --> 44:36.639
Same way I learned to tie a bow tie
and slice a pineapple: YouTube.

44:36.764 --> 44:39.458
So who you working for? Eastern bloc?

44:39.558 --> 44:44.088
- Acevedo over at Langley?
- I'm not working for anybody, okay?

44:44.188 --> 44:48.217
Why don't we skip the lies and just let
Pedro here go ahead and do his thing?

44:48.317 --> 44:50.819
You down with that?
That'd be hot, right?

44:50.945 --> 44:52.179
Hardman, please.

44:52.279 --> 44:55.474
You know what? Stand down, Pedro.

44:55.574 --> 45:01.105
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go ahead and cut right to the truth...

45:01.205 --> 45:04.583
- Serum.
- Seriously? Those don't even work.

45:06.252 --> 45:09.964
Yeah, seriously.
Now we're gonna see if it works.

45:11.507 --> 45:15.552
Why have you run away?

45:21.767 --> 45:24.211
83, 83.

45:24.311 --> 45:30.609
One more time. Why did you run away?

45:33.195 --> 45:36.932
You deprived me of my childhood.

45:37.032 --> 45:41.120
I couldn't just raise my hand and say,
"Excuse me, sir,

45:41.245 --> 45:43.230
"I don't think I really
want to be an assassin.

45:43.330 --> 45:47.818
"Can I please be excused from
this secret mountain killing school?"

45:47.918 --> 45:52.131
Please, please, can we just...
stop the waterworks?

45:54.133 --> 45:57.286
Hey, let's get to the bottom of this.

45:57.386 --> 45:59.847
Who are you working for?

45:59.972 --> 46:04.518
Nobody. I'm not working
for anybody. I promise.

46:05.561 --> 46:08.339
Okay, I worked for Sbarro
for a few weeks over the summer

46:08.439 --> 46:11.050
just to make some extra cash.
I didn't think you'd mind.

46:11.150 --> 46:14.428
Aziz Fataah Sbarro?
When the hell were you in Lebanon?

46:14.528 --> 46:19.683
Sbarro pizzeria. It's the world's largest
mall-based Italian restaurant chain.

46:19.783 --> 46:23.871
- They make these amazing garlic knots.
- Amazing garlic knots.

46:24.288 --> 46:28.025
- I just want to be normal.
- You're a Prescott. Prescotts don't cry.

46:28.125 --> 46:31.086
- Why is she crying?
- Her struggle to find her own identity?

46:31.211 --> 46:33.614
The emotional turbulence
of a first crush?

46:33.714 --> 46:36.617
Maybe she watched the notebook
one too many times.

46:36.717 --> 46:39.370
Adolescence is a very volatile
time for a young woman.

46:39.470 --> 46:42.681
- He so gets me.
- 83!

46:42.806 --> 46:46.418
You are a rogue agent.

46:46.518 --> 46:49.088
- This has got to end.
- Okay, okay, okay.

46:49.188 --> 46:52.049
Hold on now. You can't just take me.

46:52.149 --> 46:56.387
Missing girl in a small town
would throw up all kinds of red flags.

46:56.487 --> 46:58.472
Amber alert, hello?

46:58.572 --> 47:01.266
I need to go back and tie up loose ends,

47:01.366 --> 47:05.788
at least just say my grandma
got sick or something.

47:06.288 --> 47:10.442
I like it. Okay,
but it's got to be done now.

47:10.542 --> 47:13.170
You understand? Megan from Regina...

47:13.295 --> 47:16.281
- It's pronounced...
- I know how it's pronounced.

47:16.381 --> 47:19.493
Megan from Canada...

47:19.593 --> 47:22.387
has got to disappear.

47:22.763 --> 47:24.998
Forever.

47:25.098 --> 47:27.142
You got it?

47:28.519 --> 47:30.437
All right, cut her loose.

47:43.283 --> 47:47.871
Hey, ninja turtle, come on.
Wash up, bed.

47:50.123 --> 47:53.168
Parker, where did you get that?

47:57.506 --> 48:02.094
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry, Megan! Go, go, go!

48:03.595 --> 48:05.347
Hey, are you okay?

48:05.722 --> 48:08.876
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

48:08.976 --> 48:13.046
- The key is to tuck and roll.
- I'm sorry, tuck and what?

48:13.146 --> 48:17.426
- Were those secret agents?
- They were, Parker, yes.

48:17.526 --> 48:21.013
But I'm fine. No, I'm okay.
I mean, look at this.

48:21.113 --> 48:24.825
The sun is out. The clouds are shining.

48:26.326 --> 48:29.788
You are Parker, and you are Liz.

48:33.417 --> 48:36.153
- You're scared of me.
- Hell yes, I am.

48:36.253 --> 48:40.782
Not... not just me, though.
I mean, you fear the world.

48:40.882 --> 48:45.370
Every morning you dress yourself
in this cloak of sarcasm.

48:45.470 --> 48:47.431
But stripped bare of this defense,

48:47.556 --> 48:50.684
you'd be forced to forge true connections
within your peer group,

48:50.809 --> 48:53.879
allowing people to see the true Liz.

48:53.979 --> 48:57.107
Pull back the veil, Elizabeth.

48:57.691 --> 49:00.235
I won't reject you.

49:03.363 --> 49:05.615
You talk funny.

49:05.741 --> 49:10.454
Another fine observation,
you sensitive boy with no father figure.

49:14.541 --> 49:16.001
Oh, my God! Okay.

49:16.126 --> 49:20.422
- She so gets you.
- Shut up and grab her ankles!

49:27.888 --> 49:31.475
- You okay?
- Yeah, I must have sort of slept weird.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.728
I feel like I've been tossed
from a moving car.

49:35.937 --> 49:38.590
I know that feeling.

49:38.690 --> 49:41.026
So, are you going to Gooch's party?

49:41.151 --> 49:45.222
I don't know. I mean... It's just my dad's
not really big on parties, so...

49:45.322 --> 49:48.141
- Overprotective?
- Hypervigilant, domineering,

49:48.241 --> 49:50.185
intrusive. Any of those work.

49:50.285 --> 49:53.939
I know what you mean. My foster parents
could be pretty controlling sometimes.

49:54.039 --> 49:55.857
Oh, yeah?
What, did they ground you a lot?

49:55.957 --> 49:59.986
- More like solitary confinement.
- Canada really does suck.

50:00.086 --> 50:03.532
I was never really given a chance
to figure out what I want.

50:03.632 --> 50:05.826
I practically had to fake my own death
just to get out of there.

50:05.926 --> 50:08.678
Well, I mean, at least you stood up
for yourself. That's cool.

50:08.804 --> 50:10.664
Just sometimes I wish I had a way out.

50:10.764 --> 50:14.251
A way out... of here? Why would you ever
want to leave these place?

50:14.351 --> 50:17.896
I guess it's just time for something new.
I guess that's what college is for.

50:18.021 --> 50:22.067
But I don't know. I mean, have you
thought about what's next for you?

50:22.776 --> 50:24.636
No.

50:24.736 --> 50:26.012
- No?
- No, actually.

50:26.112 --> 50:29.616
I've been so focused on this year,
I haven't really thought about it.

50:29.741 --> 50:33.829
You should. You know, you got
a whole life ahead of you.

50:37.791 --> 50:39.960
It doesn't matter.
You know, whatever you do...

50:40.085 --> 50:43.171
I'm sure it'll be impressive.

50:44.005 --> 50:47.492
- You really think so?
- Yeah. I mean,

50:47.592 --> 50:50.470
I've never seen you do something
that wasn't impressive, so...

50:52.681 --> 50:54.374
Hey, guys.

50:54.474 --> 50:56.168
- I'm was gonna have a party.
- Sweet.

50:56.268 --> 50:59.354
Bring your friends, but no dudes.

51:00.230 --> 51:03.483
That was a really nice thing
to say. Thank you.

51:05.235 --> 51:07.487
Listen, so... Gooch's party.

51:08.655 --> 51:10.657
- We can talk about it later.
- No, no, I want to talk about it now.

51:10.782 --> 51:12.325
No, you should go.

51:14.661 --> 51:17.038
Seriously, it's cool.

51:20.959 --> 51:24.462
You should really come to the party.
It could be your way out.

51:26.298 --> 51:28.717
Yeah. We'll see.

51:45.150 --> 51:47.427
Mom, you're not, like,
letting her to go that, are you?

51:47.527 --> 51:49.988
Sure. Honey, what's the big deal?

51:50.113 --> 51:53.683
Well, for starters, she was passed out
in the front yard last night.

51:53.783 --> 51:57.604
- Well, maybe she had too much to drink.
- And that's just suddenly okay with you?

51:57.704 --> 52:01.358
I know having another girl in the house
might be causing some jealousy issues,

52:01.458 --> 52:03.526
but this needs to stop.

52:03.626 --> 52:06.738
Okay, then I don't think that this party
will be a safe environment for her.

52:06.838 --> 52:09.908
- Why is that?
- Because Gooch is gonna be there,

52:10.008 --> 52:11.301
and Gooch is a pig.

52:11.426 --> 52:15.247
In business class, he had this proposal
to have a pirate-themed restaurant

52:15.347 --> 52:17.791
where after dinner you have the option
to plunder your waitress.

52:17.891 --> 52:21.211
If you think it's gonna be that dangerous,
then I think you need to go with her.

52:21.311 --> 52:24.756
- What?
- You two can walk the plank together.

52:24.856 --> 52:27.968
- That... is that a joke?
- You're going.

52:28.068 --> 52:30.487
Oh, my God!

52:30.612 --> 52:32.072
Yeah, and try to have some fun.

52:34.199 --> 52:37.077
That's sick. "Oh, don't tase me, bro."

52:38.536 --> 52:40.355
Parker. Oh, my God.

52:40.455 --> 52:43.333
Parker. Where do you get these things?

52:43.458 --> 52:46.294
Honey. Parker.

52:50.548 --> 52:52.367
You look cute.

52:52.467 --> 52:54.761
Thanks. You too.

53:02.894 --> 53:07.674
- Isn't this awesome?
- Yeah. Like a bally's total fitness.

53:07.774 --> 53:11.319
Yeah! Freedom!

53:12.403 --> 53:14.531
Give me your drink, bro.

53:17.158 --> 53:20.061
Well, I'm gonna need
to black that out, so...

53:20.161 --> 53:21.996
Keg?

53:22.539 --> 53:23.873
I'm okay!

53:24.666 --> 53:27.669
Yeah, I'm okay!

53:39.264 --> 53:42.959
No, but, true story...
we met when I was in Australia.

53:43.059 --> 53:45.211
He was practically
royalty there, you know.

53:45.311 --> 53:48.923
Wait, so you're friends with him?
Because I love his movies.

53:49.023 --> 53:50.925
Well, I wouldn't say we're friends,

53:51.025 --> 53:55.655
but you should see
the snapchats he sends me.

53:56.865 --> 53:59.909
That is the coolest thing
I have ever heard.

54:01.494 --> 54:04.481
Easy, tiger. Gonna mess up my hair.

54:04.581 --> 54:08.543
Why are you even here, 84? And why
are you pretending to know a Hemsworth?

54:08.668 --> 54:11.905
- I'm not pretending.
- Which one do you know?

54:12.005 --> 54:14.365
- Does it matter?
- "Does it matter?"

54:14.465 --> 54:18.703
Chill out. I'm just keeping
an eye on things... Megan.

54:18.803 --> 54:21.956
So Hardman sent you to watch over me?

54:22.056 --> 54:26.044
Insurance policy. If we can't
get you out, we'll force you out.

54:26.144 --> 54:28.755
By ruining my social life?

54:28.855 --> 54:31.691
Though it doesn't seem
like you have much of one.

54:35.320 --> 54:36.738
Are you wearing Kesha?

54:38.114 --> 54:41.159
Her scent is the absolute truth.

54:41.492 --> 54:43.353
And...

54:43.453 --> 54:46.581
It's Heather now. Kisses.

54:47.999 --> 54:50.944
Come back here. Where are you going?

54:51.044 --> 54:52.628
What the fuck was that?

54:55.298 --> 54:58.409
- I'm sorry.
- I'm decent.

54:58.509 --> 55:01.246
- Don't worry about it.
- No, it's fine. I think I'll probably...

55:01.346 --> 55:04.432
Stay with me, Liz Larson, and talk.

55:05.224 --> 55:08.378
- Stay and talk with me, please.
- You know my name?

55:08.478 --> 55:12.148
Yeah, why wouldn't I know your name?
Do you want to know my name?

55:12.774 --> 55:16.010
I know that according to the yearbook,
your interests are Donkey Kong

55:16.110 --> 55:19.013
and Donkey Punches,
so that's enough for me.

55:19.113 --> 55:21.157
My name is Bernard.

55:21.282 --> 55:25.728
But Bernard has Tequila, Liz Larson,

55:25.828 --> 55:28.748
- in this awesome flask.
- Pull back the veil.

55:28.873 --> 55:32.043
Bernard's Tequila in this flask Tequila.

55:32.168 --> 55:34.670
- So come, drink.
- Okay, yeah.

55:35.338 --> 55:37.548
- Yes. Are you okay?
- Okay.

55:52.146 --> 55:54.257
So, you heard about homecoming?

55:54.357 --> 55:57.552
I have my eye on this one guy.

55:57.652 --> 56:00.530
I wonder if he's here.

56:01.239 --> 56:03.725
Yep, there he is.

56:03.825 --> 56:06.119
Yeah, don't even think about it.

56:06.244 --> 56:09.288
What? Worried somebody
might like me more than you?

56:09.413 --> 56:11.524
I'm warning you.

56:11.624 --> 56:14.085
- He's mine.
- We'll see.

56:26.430 --> 56:28.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:28.141 --> 56:30.017
So you ladies want to play
some beer pong?

56:30.143 --> 56:33.588
- Yes.
- Hey, I'm Cash.

56:33.688 --> 56:35.857
- Heather.
- Come on.

56:36.524 --> 56:39.051
Hey, are you serious?

56:39.151 --> 56:41.195
Yes.

56:48.953 --> 56:50.730
It's all because of me and my old man.

56:50.830 --> 56:55.526
He's just this mindless machine
that I can't even relate to anymore.

56:55.626 --> 56:59.280
"You got to be number one.
I won't tolerate any losers in this family.

56:59.380 --> 57:01.741
"Your intensity's for shit.
Win, win, win."

57:01.841 --> 57:04.510
It's... you son of a bitch.

57:04.635 --> 57:06.037
Sometimes...

57:06.137 --> 57:09.473
sometimes I wish my knee would just give
and he would forget all about me.

57:12.143 --> 57:16.130
I'm so sorry. I mean, I had no idea...

57:16.230 --> 57:18.649
You were such a great actor!

57:19.650 --> 57:22.153
God, that was The Breakfast
Club monologue?

57:22.278 --> 57:24.263
- Yeah.
- I love it.

57:24.363 --> 57:28.518
People don't usually believe I can act,
just 'cause of the way I look.

57:28.618 --> 57:32.997
Yeah, sure, I'm no Vera Farmiga,
but I believe I have talent.

57:33.497 --> 57:35.291
- Tremendo talent.
- Really?

57:35.416 --> 57:36.667
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

57:46.594 --> 57:49.138
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

58:06.322 --> 58:08.324
Knock-knock.

58:09.075 --> 58:12.620
Look, it's Roger. Roger rabbit.

58:12.745 --> 58:16.023
- What up?
- Come get in. Come hang. It's nice.

58:16.123 --> 58:18.250
No, it's okay.
It does look like fun in here, though.

58:18.376 --> 58:21.737
- That's where the fun is.
- Tubs are fun.

58:21.837 --> 58:23.881
You guys have not seen
Megan anywhere, have you?

58:24.256 --> 58:27.660
- Who wants to know?
- I do.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.429
- He has a trustworthy face.
- Trustworthy?

58:30.554 --> 58:33.708
A little bit, except for that smirk.

58:33.808 --> 58:36.602
She's downstairs.

58:37.061 --> 58:39.730
But... you did not hear that from me,

58:40.147 --> 58:45.569
because I... was never here.

58:47.321 --> 58:49.782
You guys have fun. Thank you.

59:23.899 --> 59:27.011
- No, really, it's so much fun.
- Hey, Megan.

59:27.111 --> 59:31.240
Do you know where...
do you know where Bernard is?

59:33.951 --> 59:37.413
This store is, like, huge.

59:37.538 --> 59:38.622
Who's Bernard?

59:38.747 --> 59:42.960
He's... just, if you know...
when he calls me back,

59:43.085 --> 59:45.504
could you just tell him
that I'm gonna be...

59:45.629 --> 59:49.008
I'm just gonna be under this table.

59:49.133 --> 59:52.244
Cab's here. Who's up for waffles?

59:52.344 --> 59:55.472
- Oh, my God, let's do it.
- Hey, Megan, you in?

59:56.974 --> 01:00:00.811
- I should really get her to bed.
- Yeah, I think she's already found one.

01:00:01.186 --> 01:00:02.813
Come on, let's grab a bite.

01:00:02.938 --> 01:00:07.776
Come on, Cash. Do you want
to hang out or bang out?

01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:12.948
Liz, hey. Sit up for a sec.

01:00:13.073 --> 01:00:16.018
I'm gonna go out for waffles,
but I'll bring you a short stack.

01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:19.204
I'll be right back.
I'll bring you waffles. Okay.

01:00:20.247 --> 01:00:22.900
Has anyone around here
told you about homecoming?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.045
- No.
- Come on.

01:00:28.255 --> 01:00:30.633
Yeah, okay.

01:00:33.302 --> 01:00:36.096
This is ridiculous.
I haven't even had coffee this morning.

01:00:36.388 --> 01:00:39.058
I wake up, and what do I come down to?
Dicks in my face.

01:00:39.642 --> 01:00:42.878
What in that head of yours thought it was
okay to sleep at a stranger's house?

01:00:42.978 --> 01:00:45.272
- You told me to go have fun.
- Fun, fun.

01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:49.443
But you stumbled in here at 6:00 a.m.
With male genitalia drawn on your face.

01:00:49.943 --> 01:00:52.529
- I made sure she was safe.
- Excuse me?

01:00:53.155 --> 01:00:54.682
She had a pillow.

01:00:54.782 --> 01:00:58.018
What she should have had
was a ride home.

01:00:58.118 --> 01:01:00.479
You don't leave a friend on a couch
because you want to go have breakfast

01:01:00.579 --> 01:01:02.398
with some silly little boy band.

01:01:02.498 --> 01:01:05.876
We look out for each other
in this family. Got it?

01:01:06.877 --> 01:01:09.004
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:09.546 --> 01:01:12.383
Assholes. They used a sharpie.

01:01:12.508 --> 01:01:14.009
You're gonna go to church
with that on your face.

01:01:14.134 --> 01:01:15.619
Why don't you walk
right up to the pastor and say,

01:01:15.719 --> 01:01:17.496
- "Hey, I've got a penis on my face"?
- I will.

01:01:17.596 --> 01:01:20.057
Oh, you will? Okay, great,
let's go show it to grandma.

01:01:33.529 --> 01:01:36.240
Step right up, gumdrop.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.479
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:46.333
Hey, there's some gum three rows back.
You think you could get on that?

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:51.255
Teenage sarcasm. Have you tried
acne and eating disorders too?

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.842
Have you tried shaving? Martin Van Buren
called and wants those sideburns back.

01:01:54.967 --> 01:02:01.665
Marty Van B. died in 1822, 14 years
before the invention of the telephone.

01:02:01.765 --> 01:02:06.270
Now you see why I prefer
homeschooling? Sit.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.760
- I'm pulling you out.
- What?

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.238
- No, we had a deal.
- Deal's off. Look at your screen.

01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:20.909
Knox escaped, and she left
a really nice death threat.

01:02:21.034 --> 01:02:22.453
How is that possible?

01:02:22.578 --> 01:02:24.455
She had help. I lost some good people.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.024
Don't want to lose you,
so I'm trying to get you somewhere safe.

01:02:27.124 --> 01:02:29.485
- I'm safe here, thank you.
- You just logged on to Facebook.

01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:31.653
- Under an alias.
- I'm taking you back.

01:02:31.753 --> 01:02:35.157
I have an actual life here now, okay?
I'm not going back to Prescott.

01:02:35.257 --> 01:02:36.800
And when Knox finds out where you are,

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:40.262
she will use your actual life
to destroy you.

01:02:40.554 --> 01:02:42.806
No attachments, remember, 83?

01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.892
I can't live like that again.

01:02:45.017 --> 01:02:48.103
Hey, we're out here.
We're gonna be late. Come on.

01:02:48.228 --> 01:02:50.589
If you want to go it alone,

01:02:50.689 --> 01:02:55.068
you'll have to go 100% alone.

01:02:56.195 --> 01:02:57.863
I won't be back.

01:02:59.573 --> 01:03:04.328
It's just... Liz is finally acting
like a human towards me,

01:03:04.453 --> 01:03:06.997
and I'm pretty sure
Roger's my first real friend,

01:03:07.122 --> 01:03:11.610
and I just got asked out
by the hottest guy to homecoming.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.089
I've never been to a homecoming, okay?
This is... I'm not going. I'm staying.

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:20.077
- Let me off.
- Remember, 83...

01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:23.096
I'm not in the rescue business.

01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:26.516
Thank you. Finally.

01:03:28.143 --> 01:03:29.837
If Knox comes...

01:03:29.937 --> 01:03:34.341
she better bring fire, she better
bring thunder, and she better bring hell.

01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:38.195
Just tell her to bring it before 10:30.
I've got a curfew.

01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:46.603
I don't know why you're so mad, all right?
I didn't pour Tequila down your throat.

01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:50.107
I got Pablo Dicasso'd on my face. Yeah?

01:03:50.207 --> 01:03:52.234
That's, like, the pinnacle
of high school humiliation.

01:03:52.334 --> 01:03:56.046
- It washed off. Sort of.
- What?

01:03:56.672 --> 01:04:01.468
Oh, my God. And the photos!
Instagram, like, owns them now.

01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:05.038
Can we just focus
on the positive for a minute?

01:04:05.138 --> 01:04:07.724
Cash asked me to homecoming!
If I hadn't gone with him,

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:10.127
he would have asked Heather.
That would have been game over.

01:04:10.227 --> 01:04:14.673
Jesus, Ringwald! Do you never tire
of this "I'm in a teen movie" fantasy?

01:04:14.773 --> 01:04:16.775
I don't even understand
why you're so obsessed with this guy.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.344
Okay, he's cute and he's in a band, yay.

01:04:19.444 --> 01:04:23.240
He also looks like the ass-baby
of Criss Angel and Russell Brand.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:29.037
Hello?

01:04:29.913 --> 01:04:33.583
Are you listening to me?
What are you staring at?

01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:36.336
Get down!

01:04:36.712 --> 01:04:40.424
- Switch seats with me!
- Oh, my God! What's happening?

01:04:42.634 --> 01:04:44.678
Somebody wants me dead.

01:04:50.058 --> 01:04:53.353
- We're in a car chase, Liz.
- Okay, why?

01:04:56.565 --> 01:04:57.899
I'm not from Canada.

01:04:58.024 --> 01:05:00.844
I'm a fugitive from
a quasi-governmental military facility

01:05:00.944 --> 01:05:03.572
that trains child assassins.

01:05:05.991 --> 01:05:09.227
I faked my own death, ran away,
and pretended to be an exchange student.

01:05:09.327 --> 01:05:11.455
- I didn't know how to tell you.
- I got to get out of here.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.648
No! Don't do that!
Why would you do that?

01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:14.875
I don't know!

01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:40.525
I need you to get your breathing
under control before you...

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.103
You feel better now, don't you?

01:05:51.203 --> 01:05:53.163
Fence!

01:06:11.848 --> 01:06:14.392
What happened?

01:06:33.203 --> 01:06:34.646
- What are you doing?
- They'll move.

01:06:34.746 --> 01:06:37.540
- Are you crazy?
- They'll move.

01:06:42.754 --> 01:06:44.339
Stop!

01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:04.150
Stay here.

01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:27.632
Kesha.

01:07:31.886 --> 01:07:35.457
<i>Get armed. You've been armed.</i>

01:07:35.557 --> 01:07:38.627
Agent 83, I thought we were done
with each other.

01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:40.603
She's a goddamn double agent, Hardman.

01:07:43.064 --> 01:07:46.067
- Why do you sound so upset?
- Your protection tried to kill me.

01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:48.862
- And what protection would that be?
- <i>84.</i>

01:07:48.987 --> 01:07:51.598
- Agent 84? You've seen her?
- Yes, I've seen her.

01:07:51.698 --> 01:07:54.701
You assigned her to shadow me.
She tried to steal my boyfriend.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.082
Follow the lead wire
back to the switching box.

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:04.361
- The red one.
- <i>Please don't blow me up.</i>

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:08.573
I did not send 84. As a matter of fact,
I thought she was dead,

01:08:08.673 --> 01:08:11.534
- <i>killed in action during the Knox escape.</i>
- What?

01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:15.205
Oh, God. This is a hell
of a state of affairs.

01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:17.290
Just send me my gear.
I can take her out.

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:20.669
<i>Oh, no, no, no, 83.
I warned you about this.</i>

01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:23.604
<i>You're on your own.</i>

01:08:25.773 --> 01:08:28.693
- Got to go.
- <i>Hardman, no...</i>

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:35.366
- Sorry.
- And that's why we wear the suits.

01:08:56.679 --> 01:08:58.473
Roger?

01:08:58.598 --> 01:09:02.227
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah, I heard about the accident.

01:09:02.602 --> 01:09:06.606
Thanks so much for coming.
I really needed a friend right now.

01:09:09.192 --> 01:09:10.593
Right.

01:09:10.693 --> 01:09:13.220
Well, I'm sure Cash is on his way.

01:09:13.321 --> 01:09:15.448
Anyway, I'm really glad you're not hurt.

01:09:17.158 --> 01:09:19.327
I'll see you around. Okay?

01:09:40.515 --> 01:09:44.185
So... trained assassin?

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:48.314
Thank God you didn't get pissed
and bump me off.

01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:53.219
Why did you come?

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:56.197
I saw the family photo.

01:09:56.322 --> 01:10:00.243
You guys looked really happy.
I wanted to be a part of that.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.997
But I never wanted this, Liz.
I'm really sorry.

01:10:04.122 --> 01:10:05.748
No.

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:10.753
Everything's fine.

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:12.672
I'm fine.

01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:16.367
I mean, really, I think
it's mostly just bruising.

01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:19.245
God... Hardman was right.

01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:22.390
I was just too stupid to listen.

01:10:24.058 --> 01:10:25.643
I got to go.

01:10:27.103 --> 01:10:30.423
- Well, don't leave us.
- It's the only way to keep you guys safe.

01:10:30.523 --> 01:10:33.359
Bullshit. Look...

01:10:33.484 --> 01:10:36.679
I'm sorry that this is not working out
the way that you always imagined.

01:10:36.779 --> 01:10:39.933
But life is messy,

01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:41.768
and it doesn't give
a free pass to anyone,

01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:43.786
no matter how many different
languages you speak

01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:47.957
or whether or not you can kill
someone with a hula-hoop.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.962
Abandoning people
is not how you help them.

01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:58.409
Leaving is what hurts. Trust me.

01:10:58.509 --> 01:11:02.805
There are vicious, self-absorbed sociopaths
out to get me right now, Liz.

01:11:03.973 --> 01:11:05.683
I mean...

01:11:05.808 --> 01:11:08.753
You survived high school, right?

01:11:08.853 --> 01:11:11.564
How bad could these guys be?

01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:02.056
Hey! Where are you going?

01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:06.035
I'm not going anywhere.
Thanks for my picture, Parker.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.413
- Okay?
- Now put back my goggles!

01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:16.629
- Shit.
- Okay...

01:12:16.754 --> 01:12:19.157
I'll let you guys have a minute.

01:12:19.257 --> 01:12:21.300
Oh, Christ!

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:25.054
- You want to check your...
- Yeah, thanks.

01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:37.900
- Yeah, well, just... call me later.
- Cool.

01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:42.180
- Fresh meat.
- Yeah!

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.906
Yeah!

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:48.703
Shut up. You cannot judge me.

01:12:48.828 --> 01:12:52.832
Not judging. Not judging.

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:56.736
Follow the mission profile,
and we all come home safely.

01:12:56.836 --> 01:12:59.672
We have the home field advantage,
so we let Knox come to us.

01:12:59.797 --> 01:13:02.909
It is homecoming, though.
Every girl should use protection.

01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:05.553
Okay, let's do this.

01:13:57.313 --> 01:14:01.776
Awesome, please take this away from me.
I'm gonna throw up all over you.

01:14:02.276 --> 01:14:04.278
Please...

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:08.849
What's it like to kill someone?

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.227
- Excuse me?
- I just mean, do you even...

01:14:11.327 --> 01:14:13.287
feel remorse when you're, like,
shooting someone in the face?

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:15.289
They used to tell us...

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:18.793
that we had to detach, but...
I never could.

01:14:18.918 --> 01:14:21.337
So, wait, then are you,
like, haunted at night

01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:23.364
by the visions of the souls
that you've taken?

01:14:23.464 --> 01:14:27.201
No, no, not... no. Not quite.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:29.512
See, I've...

01:14:29.637 --> 01:14:32.540
- never actually done it before.
- What?

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.975
Wait, you told me you were,
like, Miss Experienced.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:38.003
- I never said that.
- I distinctly remember you saying that.

01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:40.589
I know how it works, okay?
I may have said that.

01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:44.135
I've seen videos,
different ways that it's done.

01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:47.571
- I've just never done it myself.
- Like, never?

01:14:47.696 --> 01:14:51.158
I came really close once and grazed
this guy in London. Does that count?

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:53.452
That counts.

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:57.815
I think it has to go all the way in.

01:14:57.915 --> 01:14:59.500
Okay.

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:03.087
If we're gonna nitpick here,
then technically no.

01:15:03.796 --> 01:15:06.423
I've done lots of other stuff, though.

01:15:06.549 --> 01:15:08.701
Okay.

01:15:08.801 --> 01:15:10.928
- I have.
- I believe you.

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:13.414
It's not as easy as you think, okay?

01:15:13.514 --> 01:15:16.417
It can take a few times
for things to line up.

01:15:16.517 --> 01:15:19.103
I don't know why you're laughing.

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.566
No, I would... I would do it.

01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:25.901
If I had to, I would do it.

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:28.053
I just...

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:31.407
I just think the first time
should be special.

01:15:31.532 --> 01:15:33.142
Right?

01:15:33.242 --> 01:15:35.494
Yeah, well...

01:15:35.619 --> 01:15:38.455
We agree on one thing, then.

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:43.168
What are we talking about?

01:15:46.005 --> 01:15:47.006
- Would you...
- Popcorn?

01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:48.324
Would you like some popcorn?

01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:50.676
I bet you'd like some popcorn.
Wouldn't you like some popcorn?

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.042
- Hi.
- Ready?

01:15:58.142 --> 01:15:59.476
Yeah, am I good?

01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:01.378
- Better than good.
- Okay.

01:16:01.478 --> 01:16:03.731
One sec, though.

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:08.110
- Close.
- Okay.

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:12.323
There. Just a little bit
of smoke around the eyes.

01:16:12.614 --> 01:16:14.825
Adds to your mystique.

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:17.036
And me?

01:16:17.328 --> 01:16:19.747
You positive about the heels?

01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:22.691
- Yeah, I got this.
- You got this.

01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:24.960
Oh, my God! They're here.

01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:27.504
Go get 'em.

01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:29.631
Not without you. Let's go.

01:16:29.757 --> 01:16:32.092
Three, two, one.

01:16:32.384 --> 01:16:34.428
Yes.

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:36.680
So...

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:38.849
Liz Larson?

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:44.396
Yeah, you know... what can I say?
I like who I am around her.

01:16:45.022 --> 01:16:46.607
Good for you, Gooch.

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:50.652
It's Bernard now. It's Bernard.

01:17:06.418 --> 01:17:08.946
- Hello.
- How's it going?

01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:11.365
- Look at you, all dressed.
- Yeah.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:12.783
- This is nice.
- Thank you.

01:17:12.883 --> 01:17:15.594
- I like this.
- There you go, girls.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:18.180
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.

01:17:19.098 --> 01:17:21.517
- You girls look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:24.169
Wait, wait, wait. Let's take a picture.

01:17:24.269 --> 01:17:25.813
Okay.

01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:28.357
One, two... cheese.

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:30.801
What are you doing?

01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:33.512
- Make memories... not babies.
- Thank you.

01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:38.434
Remember, boys... whatever you do
to them, I'm gonna do to you.

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:39.576
Not kidding.

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:43.313
- Oh, my God, my first homecoming.
- You ready?

01:17:43.413 --> 01:17:45.999
- Just be ready for anything.
- Gotcha.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.591
Where's Cash? Seen Cash?

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.411
Not tightly there.

01:17:57.511 --> 01:18:00.264
Good tie. Little mystery, Amber.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.844
I love this song.
Do you want to go dance?

01:18:13.944 --> 01:18:16.154
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:24.413
- Should we go join them?
- Emotacon's on next. Maybe after.

01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:26.957
Sure, okay.

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:40.120
- How's the... how's the cheese?
- Not bad.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.956
It's actually pretty "Gouda."

01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:46.977
- You mean good?
- No, Gouda. It's... it's a joke.

01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:49.813
It's cheese, Gouda, it's good.

01:18:49.938 --> 01:18:53.550
Right, right. I get it, yeah. Pig Latin.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.277
No.

01:19:18.091 --> 01:19:21.370
Cash, I've... I've dreamt
about a night like this

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.473
for a really long time,
and I have had so much fun.

01:19:24.765 --> 01:19:27.851
You're the front man of an amazing band.
You're the king of this high school.

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:29.478
Wait a minute.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:32.314
Are you dumping me?

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:36.218
- I don't know.
- You know what, babe?

01:19:36.318 --> 01:19:39.096
Whatever it is,
let's talk about it later.

01:19:39.196 --> 01:19:41.974
- Later?
- Yeah. I got a big show tonight.

01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:44.951
You know, I got to keep my voice rested.

01:19:45.077 --> 01:19:48.705
Right, okay. Of course.

01:19:50.415 --> 01:19:51.792
Excuse me.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:58.965
Women...

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:00.801
who needs 'em?

01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:05.889
- I'm an idiot, and I owe you a huge apology.
- Megan, just stop.

01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:07.958
You're pissed. I get it. Can we just...

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:11.311
I'm not pissed, all right? If you want
to go date the rock star, that's fine.

01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:13.505
You want to go hang
with the cool crowd, whatever.

01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:15.590
- But I just want you to know that...
- I don't.

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:19.886
Hold on. I was practicing this in my head,
and I want to get it all out.

01:20:19.986 --> 01:20:23.140
- I'm just curious. You don't what?
- I don't want to date the rock star.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.245
All right? It turns out,
they don't get puns, like, at all.

01:20:29.454 --> 01:20:32.582
I thought about what was next for me.

01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:36.294
It's you.

01:20:38.421 --> 01:20:40.340
It's me?

01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:43.718
You really thought I'd let all this
inner buffness get away from me?

01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:48.707
Look, maybe I'm too late, but according
to my exhaustive research,

01:20:48.807 --> 01:20:51.334
it is very important
that I dance with a guy

01:20:51.434 --> 01:20:54.020
that I really, really like
at homecoming.

01:20:55.313 --> 01:20:57.816
Can I have this dance?

01:20:58.316 --> 01:21:01.344
Hell no, you can't.
Quit getting handsy with my date.

01:21:01.444 --> 01:21:04.281
- What?
- Did she try to touch you?

01:21:09.703 --> 01:21:12.122
How do you even know her?

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:16.668
- One second.
- Yeah, sure.

01:21:16.793 --> 01:21:19.529
- Your date?
- Yeah, so paws off.

01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:21.865
Hey, just one second.

01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:23.825
What are you doing? Don't taunt her.

01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:27.262
- We've got a new mission.
- Really? What is it?

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:32.209
For that douche-baguettte
to take her hands off my man!

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:34.811
Okay! Megan.

01:21:46.948 --> 01:21:48.783
Okay.

01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:52.203
Guys.

01:21:56.958 --> 01:21:59.486
Are they fighting over Roger?

01:21:59.586 --> 01:22:02.964
When I heard you died in the field,
it was the worst day of my life.

01:22:07.927 --> 01:22:10.513
Because I wanted to kill you myself.

01:22:15.393 --> 01:22:17.062
What is happening?

01:22:17.562 --> 01:22:20.340
- Oh, God, is there gluten in this?
- Gluten? It's all liquid.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.635
So? Soy sauce is liquid,
and it has gluten in it. Hello?

01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:25.737
Do you think there's soy sauce
in the fruit punch?

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:29.115
God, how much hormone-injected beef
did your parents feed you as a baby?

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.577
- Shut up, Cindy.
- You shut up, Donna.

01:22:33.286 --> 01:22:35.747
Totem pole.

01:22:47.467 --> 01:22:49.828
Before I kick your ass,
let me just say well done.

01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:53.206
- For once, you don't look like a tranny mess.
- Thanks. I really like your dress.

01:22:53.306 --> 01:22:55.809
Perfect length to show off
those cottage-cheese thighs.

01:22:55.934 --> 01:23:00.146
- You wish you had this bod. P90x, bitch.
- P90 extra large, bitch.

01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:32.303
I know you're in here.

01:23:33.596 --> 01:23:35.056
Megan.

01:23:46.651 --> 01:23:49.471
We always knew it would
end up like this...

01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:52.182
me with a knife,

01:23:52.282 --> 01:23:55.243
you with it in you.

01:23:59.956 --> 01:24:03.585
Hardman expected so much out of us.

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:06.754
But Knox opened my eyes
to a better deal.

01:24:07.755 --> 01:24:12.260
She takes care
of your precious new family,

01:24:12.635 --> 01:24:14.888
and I kill you.

01:24:26.065 --> 01:24:29.552
Plus, I got to make out with Cash...

01:24:29.652 --> 01:24:32.155
and Roger.

01:24:33.364 --> 01:24:35.366
What?

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:40.872
Hot lunch, bitch!

01:24:41.623 --> 01:24:43.708
Hey!

01:24:47.462 --> 01:24:48.963
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

01:24:49.088 --> 01:24:50.715
I'm really good.

01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:55.036
Stabbing people is fun. Are there
gonna be more people for me to stab?

01:24:55.136 --> 01:24:56.746
No, put the corn dog down.
We got to get home.

01:24:56.846 --> 01:24:58.848
Okay.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.604
Yeah, we're all clear out here.

01:25:04.938 --> 01:25:07.899
Where the hell is that girl?
God damn it.

01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:16.349
Hey!

01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:19.452
You guys really need to do something
about that perimeter security.

01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:22.330
- Megan?
- Welcome home, 83.

01:25:22.455 --> 01:25:24.440
Looks like someone
didn't get lucky tonight.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.085
Why'd you come back, Knox?

01:25:28.586 --> 01:25:34.200
Whole list of reasons, but why
don't we just settle on... revenge?

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.386
You know, you can call me Victoria.

01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:40.390
Hell, why don't we get real familiar?

01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:43.626
Why don't you call me Number One?

01:25:43.726 --> 01:25:47.755
After all, that is
what Hardman used to call me.

01:25:47.855 --> 01:25:51.134
- You're a Prescott?
- The original Prescott, sweetheart.

01:25:51.234 --> 01:25:52.694
We have a lot in common.

01:25:52.819 --> 01:25:57.348
Although, I listened to Hardman
when he warned me about...

01:25:57.448 --> 01:25:59.392
attachments.

01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:00.993
Liz!

01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:02.854
I found this little rat
scurrying outside.

01:26:02.954 --> 01:26:05.273
Don't want to hurt
your attachments, do we?

01:26:05.373 --> 01:26:06.399
Drop it.

01:26:06.499 --> 01:26:09.210
- Now.
- Now.

01:26:12.213 --> 01:26:14.949
Let them go, all right?
They're not involved.

01:26:15.049 --> 01:26:17.076
Of course they are.

01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:19.912
This doesn't have to end this way.

01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:22.749
You and I actually do
have a lot in common.

01:26:22.849 --> 01:26:27.019
- Except I'm not a psycho bitch.
- Give it some time.

01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:30.523
What do you say, 83?

01:26:32.733 --> 01:26:35.069
First Prescott?

01:26:35.194 --> 01:26:37.655
Never would have guessed.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.615
Excuse me?

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.769
Prescott probably just had
lower standards then, yeah?

01:26:42.869 --> 01:26:45.480
Taking whatever losers they could get.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.792
Well, this girl's got a mouth on her.

01:26:49.917 --> 01:26:54.130
If you wanted a fight, you could have
just said so, little bitch.

01:26:57.592 --> 01:27:00.845
Get your ass up. On your feet.
Did I stutter?

01:27:33.085 --> 01:27:35.504
Round three?

01:27:40.259 --> 01:27:42.136
You sad little thing.

01:27:43.346 --> 01:27:45.873
You think he's coming for you.

01:27:45.973 --> 01:27:48.918
Hardman doesn't give a shit about you.

01:27:49.018 --> 01:27:51.020
You're all alone.

01:27:51.771 --> 01:27:53.506
I'm definitely not alone.

01:27:53.606 --> 01:27:57.276
- Hey, she's got a ninja.
- Parker, no!

01:27:57.401 --> 01:27:59.153
Get down!

01:28:13.459 --> 01:28:16.462
What the fu...

01:28:22.969 --> 01:28:25.304
You came.

01:28:34.939 --> 01:28:38.134
Looks like Agent One is done. Cuff her.

01:28:38.234 --> 01:28:41.362
Megan. Come here.

01:28:41.487 --> 01:28:43.572
Oh, my God.

01:28:44.699 --> 01:28:47.351
Parker, that was so dumb,
but really cool.

01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:50.496
- You came back for me.
- Actually, we came for Knox.

01:28:50.621 --> 01:28:52.815
Plus, the sweet 16s needed
some real combat experi...

01:28:52.915 --> 01:28:55.668
You came back for me.

01:28:56.669 --> 01:29:02.158
Okay, okay. So we do have
our attachments, Agent Eighty...

01:29:02.258 --> 01:29:04.201
Megan.

01:29:04.301 --> 01:29:06.887
There are worse things.

01:29:07.513 --> 01:29:10.182
Don't you have a dance to get to?

01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:15.838
- You mean I'm free?
- Not really.

01:29:15.938 --> 01:29:20.718
An off-the-books agent in deep cover is not
an asset I'm willing to let go right now.

01:29:20.818 --> 01:29:23.195
I'll be in touch.

01:29:25.906 --> 01:29:28.059
Are you ready to do this?

01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:30.578
Like I'd let you go in without backup.

01:29:30.703 --> 01:29:32.121
Let's go.

01:29:32.246 --> 01:29:35.441
- Have your asses back here by midnight!
- We'll try.

01:29:35.541 --> 01:29:38.127
You want to know
a fun fact about ninjas?

01:29:38.419 --> 01:29:41.322
- Not really.
- Well, I am one.

01:29:41.422 --> 01:29:42.631
Is that right?

01:29:42.756 --> 01:29:46.760
Go to www.prescottschoolforboys
and fill out an application.

01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:50.373
Say yes. Please, can I go?

01:29:50.473 --> 01:29:52.166
- We'll talk.
- Okay, whatever.

01:29:52.266 --> 01:29:54.810
- Cute kid.
- Thank you.

01:29:56.937 --> 01:29:59.423
Hi, I'm Penny. This is my house.

01:29:59.523 --> 01:30:01.801
And I've got something you want, Penny.

01:30:01.901 --> 01:30:04.570
But first, I debrief you.

01:30:05.196 --> 01:30:09.116
- Come with me.
- I haven't been debriefed in years.

01:30:09.658 --> 01:30:12.703
<i>Why don't you</i>

01:30:12.828 --> 01:30:15.414
<i>Put up a fight</i>

01:30:15.915 --> 01:30:20.486
<i>Feel like a stranger passing by</i>

01:30:20.586 --> 01:30:25.216
<i>Staring at my shoes
as I watch you walk away</i>

01:30:25.925 --> 01:30:30.930
<i>Oh, I'm boiling up inside
I don't know what to say</i>

01:30:31.805 --> 01:30:37.628
<i>I keep telling myself I'm gonna be okay</i>

01:30:37.728 --> 01:30:42.816
<i>Staring at my shoes
as I watch you walk away</i>

01:30:42.942 --> 01:30:47.863
<i>Oh, I'm boiling up inside
I don't know what to say</i>

01:30:52.743 --> 01:30:56.664
Obviously you're not telling me
something about tonight.

01:30:57.331 --> 01:31:00.668
Did you... lose your virginity?

01:31:02.336 --> 01:31:04.004
Did you?

01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:06.907
Okay, you dirty dog.

01:31:07.007 --> 01:31:09.785
All right, all right.

01:31:09.885 --> 01:31:14.540
Well, it's only appropriate that I tell you
the story about when I lost my virginity.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.918
She was our babysitter.
She was a lot older than me.

01:31:18.018 --> 01:31:20.813
Very gentle, gentle lover.
She was about 65.

01:31:20.938 --> 01:31:22.982
Dad, stop the car.

01:31:26.735 --> 01:31:28.637
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hey, where are you going?

01:31:28.737 --> 01:31:30.531
- Megan?
- Roger!

01:31:30.656 --> 01:31:33.659
I know you're confused,
and I've got a lot to explain.

01:31:33.784 --> 01:31:37.438
But for the first time in my life,
I know exactly who I am and what I want,

01:31:37.538 --> 01:31:40.082
and I'm not afraid to say it.

01:31:40.624 --> 01:31:43.527
Roger, I think you are...

01:31:43.627 --> 01:31:45.921
amazing.

01:31:46.964 --> 01:31:49.299
That's pretty corny.

01:32:00.853 --> 01:32:02.229
Roger!

01:32:02.521 --> 01:32:04.857
Where do you think you're going?
Get back in the car.

01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:07.468
I'm a good kid, Dad.

01:32:07.568 --> 01:32:08.902
You got to let me go.

01:32:09.403 --> 01:32:11.780
Does she even have a helicopter license?

01:32:12.322 --> 01:32:14.992
Don't wait up.

01:32:15.367 --> 01:32:17.453
Roger!

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.953
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:32:35.053 --> 01:32:37.790
<i>Adolescence is a confusing time.</i>

01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:40.601
<i>It's a wonder any of us
make it out alive.</i>

01:32:44.396 --> 01:32:48.734
Seatbelts, Roger!
Seatbelts and condoms!

01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:51.653
If that comes up. If it doesn't
come up, don't bring it up.

01:32:52.446 --> 01:32:56.783
<i>In the end, Hardman was right.
Attachments are dangerous.</i>

01:32:57.367 --> 01:32:59.369
<i>They mean you care about something.</i>

01:32:59.536 --> 01:33:04.625
<i>But the people we care about
are what make life worth living.</i>

01:33:07.419 --> 01:33:09.154
<i>And hey...</i>

01:33:09.254 --> 01:33:11.924
<i>what's wrong with living dangerously?</i>

01:33:15.302 --> 01:33:18.013
<i>Never got love from a government man</i>

01:33:18.138 --> 01:33:20.624
<i>Heading downstream
till the levee gives in</i>

01:33:20.724 --> 01:33:24.128
<i>What can I do to get the money?
We ain't got the money</i>

01:33:24.228 --> 01:33:27.272
<i>We ain't gettin' out</i>

01:33:37.157 --> 01:33:39.743
<i>Heading downstream
till the levee gives in</i>

01:33:39.868 --> 01:33:44.081
<i>And my dreams are wearin' thin
All I need's relief...</i>

01:33:48.085 --> 01:33:51.129
Find out where she's applying
to college.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:58.954
Safety schools too.

01:33:59.054 --> 01:34:00.247
<i>Look at me</i>

01:34:00.347 --> 01:34:04.376
<i>I just can't believe
what they've done to me</i>

01:34:04.476 --> 01:34:06.378
<i>We could never get free</i>

01:34:06.478 --> 01:34:09.840
<i>I just wanna be</i>

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.233
<i>Look at me</i>

01:34:11.358 --> 01:34:15.304
<i>I just can't believe
what they've done to me</i>

01:34:15.404 --> 01:34:17.347
<i>We could never get free</i>

01:34:17.447 --> 01:34:19.391
<i>I just wanna be</i>

01:34:19.491 --> 01:34:22.703
<i>I just wanna dream</i>

01:34:53.692 --> 01:34:57.262
<i>All of my life been wading
in water so deep</i>

01:34:57.362 --> 01:35:00.699
<i>Now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end</i>

01:35:00.824 --> 01:35:04.911
<i>How long, how long till we have a friend</i>

01:35:15.338 --> 01:35:18.075
<i>Comin' down, feelin' like a battery hen</i>

01:35:18.175 --> 01:35:20.661
<i>Waves won't break till the tide comes in</i>

01:35:20.761 --> 01:35:22.846
<i>What will I do in the sunrise</i>

01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:27.142
<i>What will I do without my dreams</i>

01:35:37.152 --> 01:35:38.570
<i>Look at me</i>

01:35:38.695 --> 01:35:42.616
<i>I just can't believe
what they've done to me</i>

01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:44.576
<i>We could never get free</i>

01:35:44.701 --> 01:35:48.079
<i>I just wanna be</i>

01:35:48.205 --> 01:35:49.498
<i>Look at me</i>

01:35:49.623 --> 01:35:53.485
<i>I just can't believe
what they've done to me</i>

01:35:53.585 --> 01:35:55.420
<i>We could never get free</i>

01:35:55.545 --> 01:35:57.572
<i>I just wanna be</i>

01:35:57.672 --> 01:36:01.343
<i>I just wanna dream</i>

01:36:08.892 --> 01:36:12.587
<i>We're all together in the same boat</i>

01:36:12.687 --> 01:36:16.258
<i>I know you, you know me</i>

01:36:16.358 --> 01:36:19.678
<i>Baby, you know me</i>

01:36:19.778 --> 01:36:23.515
<i>We're all together in the same boat</i>

01:36:23.615 --> 01:36:27.160
<i>I know you, you know me</i>

01:36:27.285 --> 01:36:30.605
<i>Baby, you know me</i>

01:36:30.705 --> 01:36:34.526
<i>We're all together in the same boat</i>

01:36:34.626 --> 01:36:38.088
<i>I know you, you know me</i>

01:36:38.213 --> 01:36:41.241
<i>Baby, you know me</i>

01:36:41.341 --> 01:36:43.885
<i>I just wanna dream</i>

01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:46.580
<i>I just wanna dream</i>

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.015
<i>I just wanna dream</i>

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:53.270
<i>Baby, you know me</i>
