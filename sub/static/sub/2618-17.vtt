00:24.977 --> 00:26.985
Why are you doing this ?

01:01.964 --> 01:02.564
Horatio ?

01:03.385 --> 01:04.676
Hang on a second, Frank.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.179
You got to see this.

01:21.947 --> 01:23.717
- Pop that trunk, will you ?
- Yeah.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.007
Interesting use of cargo space.

01:30.418 --> 01:33.955
That would explain why
our driver was moving so fast.

01:34.081 --> 01:36.053
One thing is for sure,
she was hauling ass.

01:36.819 --> 01:37.852
Yes, Frank.

01:38.381 --> 01:39.449
A dead body

01:39.721 --> 01:41.210
can have that effect on you.

02:45.956 --> 02:46.556
Hey.

02:48.556 --> 02:49.649
Anything on our vics ?

02:50.074 --> 02:51.589
The guy in the trunk is a John Doe.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.572
What about the driver ?

02:55.003 --> 02:58.068
Her license says her name's Angela
Ross. I've got tripp running it.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.086
H. wants a reconstruction
of this, but

03:01.907 --> 03:04.007
There's no way cause there's
a whole lot left to work with.

03:04.132 --> 03:05.788
I think she was hit by another car.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.596
What gives you that ?

03:08.124 --> 03:09.891
There's a collapsed
rear quarter panel.

03:10.354 --> 03:12.109
It's inconsistent
with this accident.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.443
We're going to need as much
crash data as we can get.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.439
And unfortunately, at 6:00 a.m.,

03:16.565 --> 03:17.716
there aren't any witnesses.

03:17.939 --> 03:19.089
No witnesses, huh ?

03:19.505 --> 03:20.480
You sure about that ?

03:20.621 --> 03:21.329
What do you mean ?

03:21.455 --> 03:23.286
Check it out.
There's a traffic camera.

03:23.650 --> 03:25.379
Traffic cameras
take pictures of speeders.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.114
Maybe it caught
something worth seeing.

03:28.758 --> 03:29.658
That's good.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.720
Check it out.

03:35.522 --> 03:37.631
Any id yet on the guy
from the trunk ?

03:38.199 --> 03:38.799
Nada.

03:39.691 --> 03:41.006
All right. What do we have ?

03:41.728 --> 03:43.650
Looking at strangulation.

03:44.828 --> 03:48.166
And there's a gash on his side
that caused loss of blood.

03:48.292 --> 03:50.251
Now, I'm thinking it's postmortem.

03:50.592 --> 03:53.586
- But I'll know more at the post.
- All right. Anything else ?

03:54.197 --> 03:55.864
There was one interesting thing.

03:56.592 --> 03:59.649
Baby boy has red dye
on both his hands.

04:01.635 --> 04:02.304
Any theories ?

04:02.915 --> 04:03.807
Working on it.

04:04.382 --> 04:06.184
Let me guess.
You'll know more at the post.

04:06.613 --> 04:07.899
Always do.

04:27.407 --> 04:28.405
Hey, Alexx,

04:29.250 --> 04:32.000
what's your take on Angela Ross,
our female driver ?

04:34.313 --> 04:34.994
Well...

04:38.364 --> 04:39.468
Eyes are clear.

04:40.442 --> 04:41.466
Her pallor's good.

04:41.983 --> 04:43.676
I think she was definitely
into something hinky.

04:43.802 --> 04:46.080
I'm just waiting for tox
to tell me more.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.135
She didn't have any track marks.

04:49.955 --> 04:51.290
Body weight is normal.

04:54.331 --> 04:56.935
No sign of hep or other diseases.

04:58.194 --> 04:59.139
Meaning ?

05:02.827 --> 05:05.487
There is the look they have
when they hit my table.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.105
The bad ones.

05:08.557 --> 05:09.297
This one

05:11.316 --> 05:12.967
she didn't have that look.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.241
She was speeding out of town
at sunup with a... huh...

05:16.899 --> 05:18.395
with a body in her trunk.

05:19.998 --> 05:21.396
You asked my opinion.

05:22.769 --> 05:23.627
I'll tell you mine.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.185
I think she was up to no good.

05:27.864 --> 05:29.238
If she was, Ryan,

05:30.553 --> 05:31.877
let her tell us.

05:44.515 --> 05:45.244
Hey, Calleigh.

05:45.489 --> 05:46.089
Hey.

05:46.996 --> 05:49.814
I sent a patrol unit out to
our female driver's address.

05:50.178 --> 05:52.174
- And. What'd you find ?
- Vacant lot.

05:52.362 --> 05:53.082
Really ?

05:53.208 --> 05:55.311
- Angela's ID was a fake ?
- Yeah.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.298
Our girl just became a Jane Doe.

05:58.059 --> 05:59.820
So, we don't have an ID
on either victim.

06:00.184 --> 06:00.784
No.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.438
- So, what's next ?
- Run with what we've got.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.925
Red ink, white fibers
from the guy in the trunk.

06:07.999 --> 06:08.599
Okay.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.201
Anything yet ?

06:20.467 --> 06:23.247
Yeah, these fibers you called about
they're all over the trunk.

06:23.845 --> 06:26.832
0% sheepskin wool,
with a chromium wash.

06:27.372 --> 06:28.112
Mm. Seat covers.

06:28.405 --> 06:29.911
Exactly. Trace confirmed it.

06:30.037 --> 06:31.379
Well, maybe they were on
john doe's body

06:31.505 --> 06:32.890
when he was dumped in the trunk.

06:33.865 --> 06:34.827
What are you thinking ?

06:35.356 --> 06:38.144
I'm still thinking that this supports
my second car theory.

06:38.567 --> 06:39.167
Come here.

06:40.739 --> 06:43.229
There's damage here in
the quarter panel and bumper.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.612
She did impacted at over 60 miles
per hour. It could have happened then.

06:46.738 --> 06:48.706
Well, there's also paint transfer.

06:53.241 --> 06:56.915
Now, it could be incidental,
or it could be road rage.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.422
What about the body in the trunk ?

06:59.271 --> 07:01.046
I didn't say
it wasn't a strange case.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.782
We need to get these paint samples
to trace, have them analyzed.

07:04.908 --> 07:07.514
Every paint has
a distinct signature, so...

07:07.879 --> 07:09.702
We find the collision car,
we find a witness.

07:09.828 --> 07:10.428
That's  right.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.300
Or a murder suspect.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.494
So, you got something.

07:52.667 --> 07:53.759
I certainly did.

07:54.111 --> 07:56.780
Victim's car is a
silver frost metallic.

07:56.906 --> 07:58.776
Gray base coat,
ultragloss sealer.

07:58.902 --> 08:00.408
Okay, what about
the other sample ?

08:00.534 --> 08:03.875
Arctic silver metallic,
zinc chromium primer.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.812
A second car.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.371
She was run off the road.

08:07.497 --> 08:09.485
Alright,  let's plug into
the automotive paint database

08:09.611 --> 08:10.999
and see what we come up with.

08:16.257 --> 08:17.924
Porsche Boxster 986.

08:18.429 --> 08:21.094
3.2 liter, 0 horsepower.
Sweet ride.

08:21.223 --> 08:22.503
Yup. I'll put the word out.

08:22.629 --> 08:24.666
We're looking for an
arctic silver boxster.

08:32.868 --> 08:34.565
That look silver to you, Eric ?

08:35.090 --> 08:36.797
Yeah, as silver as a new dime.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.421
Yes. Front end damage, too.

08:39.972 --> 08:42.748
It's consistent with the collision
damage on the victim's car.

08:42.874 --> 08:44.776
Sheepskin seat covers.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.417
Yeah, just like
the fibers on our john doe.

08:50.176 --> 08:51.292
Did you get something ?

08:52.454 --> 08:53.054
Yeah.

08:54.861 --> 08:55.951
Rental contract.

08:57.149 --> 08:58.652
Sunstar rents.

08:59.098 --> 09:01.364
"The car of your dreams,
weekend rates."

09:01.740 --> 09:04.200
The question is,
whose dream is it, Eric ?

09:05.097 --> 09:06.530
His name's Russell Miller.

09:07.058 --> 09:09.383
Staying at the Copper Palms
Hotel on Collins.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.784
Interesting.
Call the Copper Palms

09:12.172 --> 09:14.888
and tell them to hang on
to our dreamer.

09:30.565 --> 09:31.305
Mr. Miller ?

09:32.515 --> 09:33.665
Yeah, I'm Russell miller.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.662
What  can I do for you ?

09:37.436 --> 09:38.413
A car rented in your name

09:38.539 --> 09:40.711
was involved in a traffic
incident this morning.

09:41.368 --> 09:42.460
What kind of incident ?

09:42.965 --> 09:44.842
Man was found dead in a trunk.

09:46.558 --> 09:48.114
Well, I valeted my car last night.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.890
I've been in a seminar all morning.

09:50.615 --> 09:51.777
You recognize that man ?

09:55.293 --> 09:56.455
Never seen him before.

09:56.831 --> 09:59.516
Material from your seat cover
was found on his clothing.

09:59.641 --> 10:03.130
Yes, it was, and there was ink
on his hands, just like the ink

10:03.566 --> 10:05.626
on your shirt right now, Mr. Miller.

10:09.366 --> 10:09.969
All right.

10:10.683 --> 10:11.311
All right, look.

10:11.469 --> 10:12.634
They guy's name is Luis.

10:12.784 --> 10:13.787
He's a valet here.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.102
He set me up with a girl.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.148
You know, for a fee.

10:18.474 --> 10:20.294
Car jockey was also a pimp ?

10:21.483 --> 10:22.969
We agreed on a price.

10:23.471 --> 10:24.802
Then he wanted more money.

10:24.937 --> 10:26.053
I refused.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.226
We had a fight.

10:28.613 --> 10:29.552
You had a fight ?

10:30.175 --> 10:31.759
Where did the fight take place ?

10:33.168 --> 10:34.013
In the car.

10:36.748 --> 10:38.310
We agreed on a price !

10:38.438 --> 10:39.460
That was for her.

10:40.282 --> 10:41.515
This is for my cut.

10:41.867 --> 10:42.900
You don't get a cut.

10:43.379 --> 10:45.633
Either I do, or you do.

10:51.492 --> 10:54.093
Look, I...
I'm a married man.

10:54.757 --> 10:56.204
This could be very bad for me.

10:56.349 --> 10:58.865
Not as bad, Mr. Miller,
as it was for Luis.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.476
Put him in the car, please.

11:03.635 --> 11:05.490
You think the hooker
might be our missing driver ?

11:05.616 --> 11:07.179
If she exists at all, frank.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.417
Pimps usually sleep
with their employees.

11:09.553 --> 11:10.834
Yes, they do.

11:10.961 --> 11:14.223
Alexx, let's run a sexual
activity kit on our john doe.

11:14.377 --> 11:15.187
Thank you.

11:17.753 --> 11:18.794
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.837
Where's Valera ?

11:20.425 --> 11:22.248
She had a meeting at
the State Attorney's office.

11:22.374 --> 11:23.414
The State Attorney ?

11:24.745 --> 11:25.594
You know why ?

11:25.843 --> 11:27.204
Don't know,
but you're stuck with me.

11:27.330 --> 11:30.500
Oh... Well, since I am,
let me bounce something off you.

11:31.211 --> 11:34.056
You know that Luis Reyes
weighed 160 pounds, right ?

11:34.182 --> 11:34.782
Right.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.850
And Russell Miller says that some

11:36.991 --> 11:38.050
mystery hooker

11:38.270 --> 11:39.620
tossed him in the trunk of a car.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.250
And you're wondering
how she did it.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.918
I'm wondering
if she even exists.

11:45.044 --> 11:46.512
She does not.

11:47.089 --> 11:49.426
Here's the results
of Valera's test swabs.

11:49.748 --> 11:51.474
DNA, on his privates was male.

11:51.603 --> 11:52.754
There was no hooker.

11:54.201 --> 11:55.246
It was just Russell.

11:56.831 --> 11:57.829
I'll tell Horatio.

12:01.212 --> 12:03.180
We found male DNA on Luis,

12:03.453 --> 12:04.568
south of the border.

12:04.744 --> 12:06.040
We think it might be yours.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.027
What do you mean ?

12:07.157 --> 12:08.376
You killed Luis,

12:08.502 --> 12:11.307
put him in the trunk of the car,
and then walked away.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.920
He was blackmailing me.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.590
Blackmailing you how ?

12:19.267 --> 12:20.147
Okay, truth.

12:22.727 --> 12:23.855
We had sex.

12:25.534 --> 12:27.060
Just a one-time thing.

12:28.951 --> 12:31.710
Then he threatened
to tell my wife.

12:40.201 --> 12:43.133
Give me $500, closet boy,
and it all goes away.

12:44.426 --> 12:45.680
What happens if I don't ?

12:46.394 --> 12:48.340
Then I pay a visit to your wife.

12:48.576 --> 12:52.027
Tell her that the man
of the house is not so manly.

12:53.631 --> 12:54.827
You can't do that.

12:55.155 --> 12:56.409
Watch me, ****.

13:03.853 --> 13:04.933
That lady...

13:05.898 --> 13:08.434
That lady drove by
at just the wrong time.

13:08.656 --> 13:09.853
She saw it all.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.899
And you ran her off the road.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.016
I did what I had to do.

14:02.245 --> 14:03.480
I made a mistake.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.874
I know it's wrong.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.800
I tried to hide
my guilt. I just...

14:09.115 --> 14:11.968
I thought, somehow,
it might just go away.

14:12.094 --> 14:14.033
But it didn't go away,
did it, Russell ?

14:14.159 --> 14:15.934
Speaking of which, Frank,

14:16.282 --> 14:17.516
read him his rights.

14:19.218 --> 14:20.566
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:20.752 --> 14:24.051
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

14:24.832 --> 14:25.960
Alexx, what did you get ?

14:26.086 --> 14:27.534
That the man
from the collision car ?

14:27.660 --> 14:29.814
Yes, and he just admitted
to strangling Luis.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.797
I just finished my post.

14:31.956 --> 14:35.969
Our  lady driver
was killed after the crash.

14:37.705 --> 14:39.268
After the crash ?

14:40.160 --> 14:42.330
- Where does that leave us ?
- Where does that leave us ?

14:42.456 --> 14:44.366
We've got one killer in custody

14:44.896 --> 14:46.382
and one on the loose.

14:59.497 --> 15:02.380
This homicide was buried
deep within the trauma.

15:02.882 --> 15:06.146
Now, these are the injuries
she sustained in the crash.

15:09.115 --> 15:11.263
The fractures radiate

15:11.498 --> 15:14.997
outward from the point of impact,
to the back of her skull,

15:16.084 --> 15:17.986
and that's where things get weird.

15:19.136 --> 15:22.263
Instead of a radial fracture,
I found a compression,

15:22.389 --> 15:23.636
which couldn't have been caused

15:23.762 --> 15:26.208
by anything her head
hit in the accident.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.273
So she was hit her in
the back of the head.

15:28.725 --> 15:30.480
With something other than a fist.

15:33.368 --> 15:35.482
Ah,what do you think
the weapon was, Alexx ?

15:35.987 --> 15:37.278
Horatio, I don't know.

15:37.889 --> 15:40.894
I'm going to have to shave
her head and cast it to determine.

15:41.105 --> 15:43.606
Okay, and we need
to go back to the car.

15:46.756 --> 15:49.022
So this time,
we approach it from the front.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.466
That's right,
from the front,

15:50.636 --> 15:52.299
where the killer must have stood.

15:52.609 --> 15:54.892
This door was shut when
you got to the scene, right ?

15:57.025 --> 15:58.614
Yeah, the window was blown out,

15:58.740 --> 16:01.358
and access to the door
was blocked by a tree.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.012
So the killer had to reach
in through the windshield.

16:04.738 --> 16:07.395
All windshields are made up
of two pieces of glass

16:07.521 --> 16:10.932
held together in the middle
by a layer of lyvinyl butyral.

16:11.829 --> 16:13.132
It acts as an adhesive.

16:18.087 --> 16:19.998
When her head hit the windshield,

16:20.127 --> 16:21.859
it blew through this layer...

16:25.998 --> 16:27.927
but it wouldn't have
been peeled out and

16:28.053 --> 16:29.380
curled around like this.

16:29.567 --> 16:30.904
Someone peeled it back.

16:31.186 --> 16:31.843
Rescue ?

16:32.066 --> 16:32.666
N o.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.520
No, rescue never touched the glass,

16:34.826 --> 16:38.200
but whoever did might have left
some prints or some other trace.

16:53.829 --> 16:55.093
I've got a diamond.

16:55.988 --> 16:57.886
You sure it's not a
piece of broken glass ?

16:58.209 --> 16:59.841
Polished, precision-cut.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.799
If it fell out of its setting,
it could be part of a larger piece.

17:13.801 --> 17:17.219
There was no mention of Angela
wearing a necklace or ring.

17:17.377 --> 17:18.540
Maybe the killer took it.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.575
Maybe we just got motive.

17:26.792 --> 17:27.999
Checking out the carat weight ?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.344
Carat weight is its value
in the real world, my friend.

17:31.470 --> 17:33.129
I'm checking out its value to us.

17:33.255 --> 17:33.855
Which is ?

17:33.948 --> 17:34.548
The girdle.

17:36.001 --> 17:36.705
Excuse me ?

17:37.081 --> 17:38.587
On a diamond,
the girdle is the rim

17:38.713 --> 17:39.973
that's formed at
the top of the stone,

17:40.099 --> 17:41.942
and that's where
they place the DIA number.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.001
Right: Diamond Index of America.

17:44.127 --> 17:46.557
They registeall
the high-quality diamonds.

17:52.661 --> 17:55.338
They inscribe across
the diamond with a laser.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.108
So our diamond is registered ?

18:02.378 --> 18:06.277
Yep, and the DIA will tell us
exactly who the rightful owner is.

18:29.889 --> 18:30.489
Hello,

18:32.120 --> 18:33.822
welcome to Fieldcrest Jewelers.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.181
I'm Chris Kaiser.

18:35.307 --> 18:36.626
Is there something
I can help you find ?

18:36.752 --> 18:38.010
Actually, yes.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.352
Big day coming up
for both of you, hmm ?

18:42.529 --> 18:43.797
No, we're with the crime lab.

18:44.185 --> 18:45.969
Oh. Is everything okay ?

18:46.639 --> 18:49.477
Yeah, we're actually
looking for the rest of this.

18:53.216 --> 18:57.478
Uh, yes, it seems to be a diamond
from a piece that was stolen la night.

18:57.842 --> 18:58.971
Afsana necklace,

18:59.097 --> 19:00.412
it's worth $4 million $.

19:01.715 --> 19:02.766
Do you know this woman ?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.159
Yeah, that's Barbara.

19:04.484 --> 19:06.043
You're certain that
her name is Barbara ?

19:06.169 --> 19:07.156
It's not Angela ?

19:08.440 --> 19:09.267
No, Barbara.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.310
Barbara Sommers.
She works here.

19:11.862 --> 19:13.318
At least we know who she is.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.135
Yeah,but not why
she changed her identity ?

19:15.261 --> 19:17.269
I'm sorry, but why
are you asking about her ?

19:17.504 --> 19:19.529
Do you think she's the one
that stole the necklace ?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.291
She was killed this morning.

19:22.623 --> 19:23.223
What ?

19:23.468 --> 19:24.907
We think she was murdered.

19:25.194 --> 19:26.444
That's impossible, I mean...

19:29.526 --> 19:30.879
She was one of the nicest people.

19:31.005 --> 19:32.264
Who would do something like that ?

19:32.390 --> 19:34.417
We were actually hoping
that you might have an idea.

19:35.657 --> 19:38.640
No, um, she really kept to herself.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.672
The necklace,
I have to ask: did you...

19:42.130 --> 19:42.730
No,

19:43.281 --> 19:46.055
but now that we know what it is,
we'll alert the local pawn shops.

19:46.181 --> 19:47.314
They'll be on the lookout.

19:47.825 --> 19:48.624
Ah. Thank you.

19:49.093 --> 19:51.089
If there's anything else
I can do to help...

19:51.215 --> 19:53.967
Ah, actually, huh...
do you have Barbara's address.

19:55.916 --> 19:56.516
Sure.

20:04.577 --> 20:07.099
This is where the jewelry
store owner says she lived.

20:12.436 --> 20:13.801
Somebody kicked the pet door in.

20:13.927 --> 20:15.066
Yes, let's...

20:17.694 --> 20:18.895
let's get that to the lab.

20:19.021 --> 20:19.940
Did you see that ?

20:20.066 --> 20:20.666
Yeah.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.372
Hold off on that a second.

20:25.127 --> 20:25.843
Hold off.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.173
Hey, Danny ?

21:06.430 --> 21:07.071
Danny ?

21:18.050 --> 21:18.708
Danny ?

21:20.637 --> 21:22.445
Danny, you can come out. It's safe.

21:30.845 --> 21:31.714
Are you okay ?

21:34.164 --> 21:34.764
Okay.

21:35.037 --> 21:36.994
Is there anyone else here, Danny ?

21:39.354 --> 21:39.954
No.

21:40.469 --> 21:41.667
Okay, where's your dad ?

21:44.310 --> 21:45.155
Heaven.

21:45.296 --> 21:46.629
Your dad's in heaven.

21:47.269 --> 21:48.149
Okay, Danny,

21:48.455 --> 21:50.122
I am a police officer,

21:50.721 --> 21:52.365
and it is safe to come out.

21:53.574 --> 21:55.195
I want you to take my hand.

21:57.120 --> 21:57.720
Danny.

22:00.347 --> 22:01.468
Come on, pal.

22:05.662 --> 22:06.443
Good man.

22:06.918 --> 22:07.723
Come on.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.374
That the victim's son
with the social worker ?

22:25.500 --> 22:28.089
Yes, and he is terrified to talk.

22:29.263 --> 22:29.897
Abused ?

22:30.109 --> 22:30.884
Possibly.

22:32.378 --> 22:33.926
Mother's a jewel thief and

22:34.052 --> 22:35.774
father's dead
That will screw up a kid.

22:35.900 --> 22:36.836
Yes, that will do it.

22:36.962 --> 22:38.224
Ma'am, how's he doing ?

22:38.540 --> 22:39.981
I told him about his mother.

22:40.107 --> 22:41.258
He's processing.

22:41.704 --> 22:42.409
Okay.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.284
Looks like he's been
trained to remain silent.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.561
Seems like it.

22:47.476 --> 22:49.312
So he's afraid
of telling the truth ?

22:49.540 --> 22:50.510
It's  possible.

22:50.694 --> 22:52.334
Fear levels off the chart.

22:52.761 --> 22:53.747
We can't tell why.

22:54.381 --> 22:56.094
This is going to be
a difficult case.

22:56.220 --> 22:56.913
Thank you, ma'am.

22:57.039 --> 22:57.908
Thanks, Lieutenant.

23:00.457 --> 23:01.549
Miss Boa vista...

23:04.069 --> 23:04.850
are you okay ?

23:05.525 --> 23:06.125
Yeah.

23:08.214 --> 23:08.930
No, I'm fine

23:11.057 --> 23:12.927
Alexx, the casts.

23:13.053 --> 23:13.925
- On Barbara ?
- Yeah.

23:14.051 --> 23:15.270
Was on my way down to start.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.910
Okay, I want you to hold off
so we can fluoroscope the body.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.259
Looking for anything special ?

23:21.388 --> 23:23.214
I am, but I don't want to lead you.

23:24.769 --> 23:27.042
Keeps it interesting.
Give me 30 minutes.

23:27.168 --> 23:27.768
Got it.

24:12.514 --> 24:13.993
got a hit on the windshield ?

24:14.392 --> 24:15.776
Well, we're getting there.

24:15.902 --> 24:17.463
Lucky to get anything at all.

24:18.285 --> 24:20.023
Luck had nothing to do with it.

24:26.389 --> 24:27.188
Howard Benchley :

24:27.740 --> 24:29.883
One DUI, live in michigan.

24:30.059 --> 24:31.979
Let's find out what
brought him to Miami.

24:32.384 --> 24:33.112
Let's do that.

24:37.574 --> 24:39.694
What are you doing
in Miami, Mr. Benchley ?

24:40.210 --> 24:41.678
Been a long winter in Detroit.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.522
Thought I'd get a little Miami sun.

24:44.355 --> 24:45.641
But you're on probation.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.277
I reported my whereabouts to my PO.

24:48.660 --> 24:49.766
That's how you found me.

24:50.555 --> 24:53.267
How did your fingerprints get on
Barbara Sommers' windshield ?

24:54.430 --> 24:55.428
That's her name ?

24:56.415 --> 24:57.192
Poor lady.

24:58.528 --> 25:00.284
Answer the question, Mr. Benchley.

25:01.123 --> 25:03.535
I was on my way back
from the Mikasuki Casino.

25:04.081 --> 25:06.442
Saw a car sitting there,
so I pulled over to help.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.920
Are you okay ?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.288
She was dead.

25:22.445 --> 25:23.619
So I called it in.

25:24.288 --> 25:25.427
But didn't hang around.

25:25.938 --> 25:27.113
Didn't see the point.

25:27.512 --> 25:29.502
Or you were drunk when
you were leaving the casino.

25:33.647 --> 25:34.397
Come on.

25:35.385 --> 25:36.547
This long after ?

25:36.970 --> 25:38.919
Breathalyzer won't
register anything.

25:39.890 --> 25:41.628
Look, there was
nothing I could do.

25:42.156 --> 25:42.756
Really ?

25:43.730 --> 25:47.073
'Cause y could have killed her
and stolen a $4 million necklace.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.728
Do I look like a guy that
just came into a fortune ?

25:53.237 --> 25:54.482
I don't know, Mr. Benchley.

25:55.339 --> 25:57.253
But you don't look
like a guy who's innocent.

26:05.890 --> 26:06.852
Hey, Natalia.

26:06.978 --> 26:07.778
Hey.

26:08.246 --> 26:10.410
Hey, how's the case going
with the lady from the crash ?

26:10.536 --> 26:11.790
I hear you guys are stuck.

26:12.575 --> 26:14.384
Yore hearing a lot of things,
aren't you ?

26:16.862 --> 26:18.978
Yeah. No, no, I get it
that there's a mole in the lab,

26:19.104 --> 26:21.148
and I'm the new girl,
so it must be me.

26:23.962 --> 26:24.843
You're right.

26:25.170 --> 26:25.992
It's silly.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.890
Let's start over, okay ?

26:29.395 --> 26:31.191
The case is weird.

26:31.743 --> 26:32.698
Barbara Sommers.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.164
Well, if that's even her name.

26:34.290 --> 26:35.578
Her kid won't talk.

26:35.704 --> 26:37.069
Her identity keeps changing.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.403
She stole this necklace,
and someone killed her.

26:40.905 --> 26:42.643
Maybe her past caught up with her.

26:42.972 --> 26:44.017
What does that mean ?

26:45.367 --> 26:46.906
Nothing, it's just...

26:47.961 --> 26:49.194
you know, some people

26:49.370 --> 26:51.450
have secret lives.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.082
What kind of secret lives ?

26:53.208 --> 26:54.562
I've already said enough, okay ?

26:54.688 --> 26:56.684
Just try to think of her as a person.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.158
Hey, wait a minute.

26:59.215 --> 27:00.615
You know something
you're not saying ?

27:00.741 --> 27:01.541
No.

27:05.971 --> 27:07.185
You know,
you say something like this,

27:07.311 --> 27:09.169
and you tell me you're not the mole,
and I'm supposed to believe that.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.675
I need to know the truth.

27:12.612 --> 27:13.611
You know what ?

27:14.655 --> 27:16.217
Forget I tried to help.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.299
So, what do we got ?

27:38.661 --> 27:41.279
I processed the pet door
from Barbara Sommers' place.

27:41.564 --> 27:42.403
Okay, what'd you find ?

27:42.529 --> 27:44.960
Nothing significant,
except this.

27:46.745 --> 27:48.474
Is that some kind of
metal shavings ?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.289
Yeah, and these are the SEM results.

27:51.747 --> 27:52.513
Okay.

27:52.639 --> 27:59.934
It's... 92.5% silver,
7.5% copper alloy.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.965
I recognize this.

28:02.188 --> 28:04.020
It's the properties of
sterling silver.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.310
Sterling silver shavings.

28:07.624 --> 28:09.170
Makes perfect sense.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.138
From the pet door ?
What's that mean ?

28:11.264 --> 28:14.215
It means that our jewelry
store manager's lying.

28:23.887 --> 28:26.060
You do engraving
at the store, don't you ?

28:28.525 --> 28:29.840
Is that against the law ?

28:30.510 --> 28:33.727
We found sterling silver
residue inside barbara's house.

28:35.523 --> 28:37.144
She worked at a jewelry store.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.649
As a clerk.

28:42.572 --> 28:43.372
Okay.

28:45.230 --> 28:47.801
Okay, so I went looking
for the necklace.

28:48.176 --> 28:49.143
But that's all.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.645
Were you going to hock it yourself ?

28:50.771 --> 28:51.371
No.

28:51.405 --> 28:52.960
Don't lie to me, Chris.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.295
I'm telling the truth.

28:55.445 --> 28:56.622
I was in a jam either way.

28:56.748 --> 28:57.548
Why ?

28:59.308 --> 29:01.774
I hired the girl
who ripped the store off.

29:02.795 --> 29:04.899
We're insured,
but it still looks bad.

29:05.527 --> 29:06.470
I lose my job.

29:06.596 --> 29:08.123
I just got promoted to manager.

29:10.071 --> 29:11.528
I didn't kill her, I swear.

29:12.715 --> 29:14.829
It's a $4 million necklace, Chris.

29:14.969 --> 29:16.367
People have killed for less.

29:17.806 --> 29:20.766
Why didn't you report the thef
when you first discovered it ?

29:21.725 --> 29:24.508
I told you,
she was my hire.

29:24.742 --> 29:25.608
It was on me.

29:25.734 --> 29:27.519
So you were going
to find it yourself.

29:28.253 --> 29:29.813
You bitch, open the door !

29:29.939 --> 29:31.428
I've already called
the police, Chris.

29:31.554 --> 29:32.309
I know you got it !

29:32.435 --> 29:34.716
I know you took that necklace,
and you're giving it back !

29:34.842 --> 29:36.932
You bitch !

29:41.129 --> 29:42.409
It was my only option.

29:45.027 --> 29:46.613
I have one thing to say to you.

29:47.254 --> 29:49.077
If you had reported it missing,

29:49.203 --> 29:51.634
then Barbara Sommers
might still be alive.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.229
And no necklace is worth that.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.387
I downloaded the images
from the traffic cam.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.260
Your victim's car.

30:12.656 --> 30:14.700
God, what's she doing, 90,100 ?

30:15.412 --> 30:16.633
She's moving for sure.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.555
Wait a second.
She's heading north.

30:21.071 --> 30:21.871
So ?

30:22.148 --> 30:24.344
The accident happened in the southund lane.

30:25.095 --> 30:26.247
I was wrong.

30:27.719 --> 30:30.004
I think our victim might
have had a conscience.

30:33.637 --> 30:37.503
I fluoroscoped the body, Horatio.
What I found made me sick.

30:37.629 --> 30:40.145
I don't blame you, Alexx.

30:40.271 --> 30:41.672
This is abuse.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.355
Ribs, nose, fingers,

30:44.481 --> 30:46.818
arms, ankles, soup to nuts.

30:47.029 --> 30:48.524
I counted 14 breaks,

30:48.650 --> 30:51.622
and it couldn't have come from
the crash because they've all healed.

30:51.748 --> 30:53.806
Beaten to within an inch of her life.

30:53.932 --> 30:57.575
For years, judging from
the density of the knitted bone.

30:57.701 --> 31:01.676
This is why she was running,
and this is why the boy won't talk.

31:06.220 --> 31:07.020
Lieutenant.

31:07.722 --> 31:10.650
Natalia, Eric said you may have
info on this case,

31:10.776 --> 31:13.548
and it's possible that
she's part of an organization,

31:13.911 --> 31:17.152
an underground organization
that protects abused women.

31:17.903 --> 31:20.577
I think she is.
I belong to the same thing.

31:21.234 --> 31:22.174
I'm sorry ?

31:23.125 --> 31:25.676
It's an organization that
prides itself on its anonymity.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.012
But I think I can help.

31:27.657 --> 31:28.526
Okay.

31:30.458 --> 31:34.157
This is obviously a big decision for you.
Why don't you take some time with it ?

31:36.517 --> 31:37.604
Give me an hour.

31:38.151 --> 31:39.662
I'm going to call
some of my contacts.

31:39.788 --> 31:42.049
They're spread out everywhere,
it's like a big family.

31:42.994 --> 31:43.934
I understand.

31:44.532 --> 31:45.413
Thank you.

31:57.710 --> 32:00.543
<i>Horatio, we've got someone
trying to move the necklace.</i>

32:00.669 --> 32:02.395
Frank, I'm on my way.

32:05.022 --> 32:06.138
Let me go !

32:07.499 --> 32:09.554
Pawning property isn't illegal.

32:09.777 --> 32:11.198
It is when it's stolen.

32:11.503 --> 32:13.149
Look, I found it.

32:13.275 --> 32:16.117
Found it at a murder scene.
That could make you an accessory.

32:16.304 --> 32:18.148
So you want to take
the question again ?

32:19.897 --> 32:22.633
I was on my way back
into town from Biscayne.

32:22.808 --> 32:25.708
I came up on this wreck.
She was already dead

32:38.325 --> 32:40.697
So what are you,
a roadkill pirate ?

32:42.743 --> 32:45.635
I called in the accident.
That's got to count for something.

32:45.761 --> 32:47.546
What counts is your rap sheet.

32:47.839 --> 32:49.718
We've got you
on a string of robberies :

32:50.000 --> 32:52.342
Wallet from a pedestrian
in a hit-and-run,

32:52.468 --> 32:54.558
CD player from another crash,

32:54.707 --> 32:58.511
set of water skis off an SUV
that broke down on highway 1.

32:58.757 --> 33:01.999
I need you to tell me
what you saw at the wreck site.

33:03.936 --> 33:04.814
Okay.

33:05.542 --> 33:08.128
Just before I stopped,
a car was pulling away.

33:08.466 --> 33:10.433
A silver car,
like a sports car ?

33:10.920 --> 33:12.981
No, it was big,
like a truck. Big.

33:13.855 --> 33:14.942
Like an SUV ?

33:16.703 --> 33:18.890
The sun was in my eyes, but, yes,

33:19.016 --> 33:20.839
like an SUV.
Can I go now ?

33:20.965 --> 33:22.694
Let me see.
How can I put this ?

33:22.820 --> 33:25.263
No. Officer,
hang on to her for a second.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.041
Frank, I've got to take this.

33:39.966 --> 33:41.883
- Ms. Boa vista ?
- Lieutenant.

33:42.009 --> 33:42.939
Did you get something ?

33:43.065 --> 33:44.783
Yes, Barbara Sommers' married name.

33:44.909 --> 33:45.640
It's Benchley.

33:45.766 --> 33:47.815
- Ms. Benchley.
- Does that mean anything ?

33:47.941 --> 33:51.429
That means that Howard Benchley
drives an SUV.

34:02.640 --> 34:07.048
Howard, you neglected to tell us
that Barbara is your ex-wife.

34:07.576 --> 34:08.739
Didn't seem pertinent.

34:08.938 --> 34:10.867
You honestly expect
us to believe that ?

34:10.993 --> 34:11.793
Look.

34:12.038 --> 34:14.116
I hate the fact that
she was ever my wife.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.572
So I guess I block it out
when talking about her.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.456
Yes, and yet you came...

34:19.453 --> 34:21.074
you came to Miami to see her.

34:21.496 --> 34:22.295
No, not her.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.132
Danny. My son.

34:25.426 --> 34:27.132
Then what were you doing
following her ?

34:27.257 --> 34:29.583
Trying to get some dirt.
Regain custody.

34:30.273 --> 34:31.647
She's the crazy one.

34:31.835 --> 34:36.143
Yes, and now she's the dead one, Howard,
so, mission accomplished for you.

34:37.806 --> 34:38.969
I didn't kill her.

34:39.574 --> 34:42.146
Everything's coming up roses
for you, isn't it, Howard ?

34:44.101 --> 34:45.754
Why don't you think about
it in holding for a while.

34:45.880 --> 34:46.748
Let's go.

34:51.187 --> 34:51.954
Guy's cagey.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.487
There's one way
to make him talk, Frank.

34:54.886 --> 34:55.674
What's that ?

34:55.800 --> 34:57.303
Find the murder weapon.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.842
I'm stepping out for a bite.
You want something ?

35:15.968 --> 35:17.369
- No, no, I'm cool.
- Okay.

35:17.495 --> 35:18.954
You come in and look
at this for one sec ?

35:19.080 --> 35:19.880
Sure.

35:20.667 --> 35:23.615
Officers executed
a warrant on Howard's car.

35:24.037 --> 35:26.400
These were all the possessions
that could have done the damage.

35:26.526 --> 35:27.671
None of them are.

35:28.677 --> 35:31.859
That's a plaster cast that Alexx
made of Barbara's head wound.

35:32.328 --> 35:34.301
But none of Howard's things fit.

35:34.935 --> 35:37.029
He could have tossed
what he used, but, uh...

35:37.347 --> 35:39.425
he's an amateur,
so I'm hoping he didn't.

35:39.590 --> 35:40.858
I know what he used.

35:41.618 --> 35:42.429
A gun.

35:45.070 --> 35:48.541
First blow glanced off the side
of her head, leaving a groove.

35:52.909 --> 35:54.963
Next one hit her bluntly.

35:57.006 --> 35:59.507
The coup de grace :
edge of the handle.

36:02.689 --> 36:04.684
All combined,
it would have killed her.

36:06.233 --> 36:09.019
But there were no guns found in
either vehicle, or at the crime scene.

36:09.145 --> 36:10.296
It's got to be somewhere.

36:11.446 --> 36:12.246
Yeah.

36:12.764 --> 36:14.931
I think it's time we
questioned Howard again.

36:15.828 --> 36:16.771
Well, maybe not.

36:16.897 --> 36:19.116
Wasn't the necklace
recovered at a pawnshop ?

36:19.949 --> 36:22.239
Yeah, maybe it's not
the only thing she pawned.

36:25.203 --> 36:27.064
Looks like lunch is a drive-through.

36:49.755 --> 36:51.833
Already did my civic service today.

36:52.303 --> 36:53.715
Gave up a sweet sheet of ice.

36:53.841 --> 36:56.665
Ah, come on, I know you love
the repeat business.

36:56.865 --> 36:58.763
Why do I think
this ends badly for me ?

36:58.889 --> 37:00.792
Well, it depends on
how helpful you are.

37:00.935 --> 37:03.823
When Rita pawned the necklace,
that wasn't all she had, was it ?

37:05.245 --> 37:07.031
Make it easy on yourself.
I know how many hot,

37:07.157 --> 37:08.630
unregistered guns
you've got in there.

37:08.756 --> 37:10.882
Now, why would you go say
something like that ?

37:12.138 --> 37:13.817
I'm guessing Rita pawned a gun.

37:14.071 --> 37:16.209
You give me the one
I'm looking for, we're good.

37:19.214 --> 37:22.027
Okay. She pawned
a nine-millimeter.

37:22.543 --> 37:24.504
See ?
That wasn't so hard.

37:29.828 --> 37:32.367
Pawnshop guy said he wiped it down
before he planned to move it.

37:32.493 --> 37:34.560
You know, no one
wants to buy dirty gun.

37:34.924 --> 37:39.293
Well, there's pawnshop clean,
and then there's CSI cleans,

37:43.543 --> 37:45.710
if you had a gun,
why wouldn't you fire it ?

37:45.910 --> 37:47.178
If it wasn't loaded.

37:47.969 --> 37:49.447
And how would you
know it wasn't loaded ?

37:49.573 --> 37:50.889
Check the magazine.

37:52.074 --> 37:52.932
Bingo.

37:53.699 --> 37:54.545
See ya.

38:38.047 --> 38:40.936
You won't believe me, but
I didn't come to town to kill her.

38:42.140 --> 38:43.721
You're right.
I don't believe you.

38:43.847 --> 38:45.339
I just wanted to see her.

38:45.599 --> 38:48.397
To get her back.
I was the only man for her.

38:48.523 --> 38:49.794
But she disagreed with you.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.694
She just needed convincing.

38:52.151 --> 38:53.953
So in order to convince her,

38:54.422 --> 38:55.549
you killed her,

38:55.995 --> 38:56.806
Howard.

38:58.498 --> 38:59.731
She was past help.

39:00.670 --> 39:01.974
And ditching Danny ?

39:02.540 --> 39:03.949
I did her a favor.

39:06.005 --> 39:07.085
Typical barb,

39:07.612 --> 39:10.548
keeps a gun for protection,
then forgets to load it.

39:17.860 --> 39:18.694
Barb ?

39:19.257 --> 39:22.040
- Where's Danny ? !
- *****************

39:28.095 --> 39:30.385
You're as bad a mother
as you were a wife !

39:30.631 --> 39:32.088
Leave me alone...

40:08.746 --> 40:10.507
You've made your son an orphan.

40:11.446 --> 40:12.633
He's still got a dad.

40:12.773 --> 40:15.736
At this point, Howard,
he doesn't think so.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.192
Barb told him I was dead ?

40:19.318 --> 40:22.007
That's correct,
and I understand her instinct.

40:22.324 --> 40:25.070
Well, legally, I'm still
that boy's father.

40:25.196 --> 40:28.402
That is true.
But being someone's father...

40:29.094 --> 40:32.036
is not a right ;
it's a gift.

40:34.489 --> 40:35.429
Take him.

40:53.866 --> 40:54.644
Hey ?

40:54.770 --> 40:55.721
Let it go.

40:59.897 --> 41:01.118
Look, I'm sorry.

41:02.386 --> 41:03.186
For what ?

41:04.077 --> 41:06.158
For things that
I couldn't have known.

41:06.284 --> 41:07.916
Well, then, why the apology ?

41:08.152 --> 41:10.313
Because I think you deserve one.

41:11.156 --> 41:14.503
I heard how you helped break
the case. Barbara's background.

41:16.428 --> 41:17.945
Well, uh, it's still

41:18.520 --> 41:21.890
stuff at happened in my past,
that's not your fault.

41:23.229 --> 41:24.029
Well,

41:24.814 --> 41:26.660
earlier today is the past.

41:27.345 --> 41:28.438
So, I'm sorry.

41:30.386 --> 41:31.338
Accepted.

41:37.732 --> 41:38.813
Are you safe now ?

41:41.114 --> 41:42.523
He-he's in jail.

41:46.855 --> 41:47.888
I'm okay, Eric.

41:49.990 --> 41:51.698
And, you know, we're okay.

41:51.824 --> 41:54.127
Good. Okay.

41:56.604 --> 41:59.032
- well, some things you can count on.
- Yeah.

42:17.984 --> 42:20.070
Danny, I know it doesn't
feel like it right now,

42:20.196 --> 42:21.923
but you're going to be okay.

42:27.977 --> 42:30.184
My mom was killed,
just like yours.

42:31.417 --> 42:32.768
- Really ?
- Yeah.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.226
You mean by your dad ?

42:37.352 --> 42:38.351
I do.

42:39.395 --> 42:41.122
I do mean by my dad.

42:42.307 --> 42:43.107
So...

42:44.688 --> 42:46.226
so I want you to know

42:46.930 --> 42:48.410
that you're not alone.

42:51.568 --> 42:53.458
You really do know what it's like.

42:56.558 --> 42:58.366
I also want you to know

42:59.211 --> 43:01.771
that I am going to be
right in there

43:02.346 --> 43:04.955
every day if you need to talk.

43:05.888 --> 43:06.840
All right ?

43:09.963 --> 43:11.231
Good man.

43:12.634 --> 43:13.679
You, too.

43:17.195 --> 43:18.433
You too, partner.
