00:01.294 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:03.213 --> 00:05.966
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:06.174 --> 00:09.302
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

00:09.511 --> 00:10.679
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:13.223
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

00:13.431 --> 00:15.058
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

00:16.643 --> 00:18.812
We heard what we heard,
and afterwards
we didn't do anything!

00:19.020 --> 00:23.233
How would we explain why we
were together at 6:00 a.m.
on the 4th of July?

00:23.817 --> 00:26.987
Polly and Jason dated,
and Jason hurt Polly.

00:27.529 --> 00:30.532
Oh, my God, Jason.
He was shot.

00:31.116 --> 00:33.618
Jason's death is now being
treated as a homicide.

00:35.954 --> 00:38.540
They'll find out soon enough.
That I'm guilty.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.461
<i>Guilt, innocence.</i>

00:44.337 --> 00:45.839
<i>Good, evil.</i>

00:46.756 --> 00:48.091
<i>Life, death.</i>

00:48.591 --> 00:50.844
<i>As the shadows around
Riverdale deepened,</i>

00:51.469 --> 00:55.473
<i>the lines that separated
these polar opposites
blurred and distorted.</i>

00:57.475 --> 00:59.978
<i>"I'm guilty," Cheryl said
in Biology class.</i>

01:01.271 --> 01:02.230
<i>But of what?</i>

01:02.814 --> 01:03.690
To clarify,

01:04.899 --> 01:07.235
I didn't mean I was guilty
of killing Jason.

01:08.403 --> 01:10.196
I loved him more
than I do myself.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.866
But I am guilty

01:14.159 --> 01:16.745
of lying about what
happened on July 4th.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.873
The autopsy puts his
death about July 11th.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.541
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.501
It was July 4th.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.463
I don't know what happened
the week after that, but...

01:26.671 --> 01:30.592
Cheryl, in your own words,
what happened at
Sweetwater River?

01:31.051 --> 01:33.511
The plan was bananas,
even for me.

01:34.554 --> 01:37.182
<i>Jason wanted to leave
Riverdale and never come back.</i>

01:37.390 --> 01:39.350
<i>He asked for my help
to stage a tragic accident,</i>

01:39.559 --> 01:41.644
<i>so that our mom and dad
wouldn't come after him.</i>

01:42.270 --> 01:45.190
<i>Our story would be,
we went for an early
morning boat ride,</i>

01:45.398 --> 01:48.276
<i>and the boat tipped,
and capsized,
and Jason drowned.</i>

01:48.485 --> 01:52.238
<i>In fact, we made
it to the other side
dry as bones.</i>

01:53.698 --> 01:55.950
<i>We said goodbye
on the Greendale side
of Sweetwater River.</i>

01:58.620 --> 02:00.330
<i>He promised he'd call me
as soon as he was in a place</i>

02:00.538 --> 02:02.665
<i>where he couldn't be reached
or pulled back by our parents.</i>

02:02.874 --> 02:04.250
<i>One month, at the most.</i>

02:04.751 --> 02:07.670
Every day, I waited for him
to call, for an email.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.380
You tell anyone
about the plan?

02:09.589 --> 02:10.882
Any way that you can
corroborate it?

02:12.133 --> 02:15.261
And you have no idea
why your brother
wanted to run away,

02:15.470 --> 02:16.471
fake his own death?

02:18.014 --> 02:19.891
Doesn't that seem cruel?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.602
No, he wasn't...
Jason wasn't cruel.

02:22.811 --> 02:24.854
So maybe this is all
just a web of lies

02:25.063 --> 02:26.356
you're spinning to
cover your own tracks.

02:26.564 --> 02:27.732
I didn't kill Jason!

02:30.276 --> 02:32.821
There was a gunshot
that morning. We heard
a gunshot on July 4th.

02:33.029 --> 02:35.115
Maybe whoever killed Jason
took a shot at him,

02:35.281 --> 02:36.241
and missed that morning.

02:36.449 --> 02:39.160
You heard a gunshot,
and you're just
telling us this now?

02:39.744 --> 02:41.746
I was upset.
My brother was murdered.

02:41.955 --> 02:46.417
So upset that you
sang and danced at
a pep rally yesterday.

02:46.626 --> 02:49.003
What the hell is
going on here?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.381
Mommy.
- Don't say another
word, Cheryl.

02:51.589 --> 02:54.050
Get up. Why didn't
you call us?

02:54.259 --> 02:55.802
Because she's
a liar, Penelope.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.012
When we get home,
you're telling us
everything.

03:13.778 --> 03:14.529
Hot off the presses.

03:16.364 --> 03:16.990
Mom.

03:17.991 --> 03:21.703
First you leak
Jason Blossom's autopsy
report, and now this?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.371
People are loving
the coverage.

03:23.538 --> 03:27.167
You have to stop
sensationalizing
this horrible thing.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.878
It's news, Betty.
We own the <i>Riverdale Register.</i>

03:30.086 --> 03:32.046
We have a responsibility
to keep the people informed.

03:33.464 --> 03:38.303
- Whatever Jason did to Polly,
he's still a person.
- You reap what you sow.

03:38.511 --> 03:41.097
You should be writing
about the real story.

03:41.306 --> 03:43.349
What happened to Jason?

03:43.558 --> 03:46.352
Who was holding him captive?
Why was he frozen?

03:46.561 --> 03:48.354
And who shot that gun
on July 4th?

03:48.563 --> 03:50.523
Well, if you are
so keen on reporting,

03:50.732 --> 03:52.567
why don't you come work
with your father and me?

03:52.775 --> 03:55.403
The <i>Register</i> could really use
a Lois Lane type like you.

04:13.213 --> 04:16.674
I think I know
something that can help with
the Blossom investigation.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.345
People are saying
Cheryl heard a gunshot?

04:20.553 --> 04:22.180
That's what she's
claiming, yes.

04:24.933 --> 04:26.059
I heard it, too.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.685
I was there that morning.

04:28.144 --> 04:32.607
I didn't say anything because
at first, like everyone,
I thought Jason had drowned.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.443
But then when the autopsy came
out and said he died later...

04:36.027 --> 04:38.821
What were you doing
down at the river so early
on July 4th?

04:40.323 --> 04:42.492
Um, working on some songs.

04:43.952 --> 04:45.161
I, uh...

04:45.954 --> 04:47.205
Write songs.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.667
- Did you see
who fired the shot?
- No, sir.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.126
Were you alone?

04:54.587 --> 04:55.630
No, sir.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.465
Who were you with?

04:59.217 --> 05:01.386
Let's make it a 4th of July
you'll never forget.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.515
My dog, Vegas.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.103
So, are you a suspect now?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.397
My dad says we all are,
including me.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.857
Not me, girl.
I don't know these people.

05:15.066 --> 05:19.320
Guys, should we maybe
re-binge <i>Making a Murderer</i>
on Netflix tonight?

05:19.529 --> 05:22.282
Sorry. Can't. Gotta stay late
to work on the paper.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.533
Count me out, too.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.119
- I've got a date tonight.
- You do?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.246
Which Riverdale hottie
made the cut?

05:29.038 --> 05:30.081
Hey, Vee-Lo.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.791
I'll swing by the Pembrooke
to pick you up at 8:00?

05:32.000 --> 05:32.917
I'll be waiting.

05:33.543 --> 05:34.294
Cool.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.881
- Chuck Clayton?
- You're going on
a date with Chuck?

05:39.632 --> 05:41.384
He's kind of a player.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.845
Who cares?
He's the hottest of hot,

05:44.053 --> 05:45.972
and he's the varsity
football coach's son.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.641
In Riverdale, that's like
dating a Kennedy.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.189
If print journalism is dead,
what am I doing here?

05:55.356 --> 05:59.569
The <i>Blue and Gold</i> isn't dead,
Juggy. It's just dormant.

06:00.111 --> 06:01.195
But waking up.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.573
You're writing a novel, right?

06:03.740 --> 06:05.199
About Jason Blossom's murder?

06:06.117 --> 06:06.951
I am.

06:08.036 --> 06:10.246
Riverdale's very own <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

06:10.455 --> 06:13.291
Which started out
as a series of articles.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.920
I'm hoping you'll come write
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

06:18.129 --> 06:22.091
I just don't think
the school paper's
the right fit for my voice.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.718
Juggy...

06:24.802 --> 06:27.722
Jason's death
changed Riverdale.

06:28.598 --> 06:32.352
People don't want
to admit that, but it's true.
We all feel it.

06:33.311 --> 06:37.231
Nothing this bad was ever
supposed to happen
here, but it did.

06:38.358 --> 06:39.442
I want to know why.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.903
Would I get complete freedom?

06:42.445 --> 06:45.490
I'll help, and edit...

06:46.324 --> 06:49.994
And suggest.
But it's your story,
it's your voice.

06:50.912 --> 06:54.999
Doesn't sound like
complete freedom, but...

06:56.417 --> 06:57.293
I'm in.

06:57.877 --> 07:01.547
Okay great!
Um, in that case, I have
your first assignment.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.927
There's one person who was
at the river on July 4th
that no one's talking about.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.471
- Dilton Doiley
and his Scouts.
- Exactly.

07:15.686 --> 07:16.396
Hey.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.315
I texted. Where were you?

07:19.524 --> 07:21.401
Football practice.
Then I was writing.

07:22.777 --> 07:23.528
Songs?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.030
Your music?

07:26.906 --> 07:29.826
I thought you and Jughead were
on a road trip on the 4th.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.577
Then I talked
with Sheriff Keller.

07:31.786 --> 07:34.372
So, guess that was a lie.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.545
- Dad, we were gonna go, but...
- You should have
come to me, Archie.

07:40.753 --> 07:42.130
We could've gone
to the Sheriff together.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.132
I didn't want to
drag you into it, Dad.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.425
That was an error in judgment.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.468
Sorry, Dad.
Sorry I'm not perfect.

07:47.677 --> 07:50.721
You know, you're pretty far
from perfect lately, Archie.
That's why you're grounded.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.014
What? Are you serious?

07:52.223 --> 07:55.059
So, in this house, every
night for two weeks, 7:00.

07:55.268 --> 07:57.103
You want some alone time
with your music? You got it.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.397
- I'm not 10 years old, Dad!
You can't just...
- You wanna go for three?

08:05.736 --> 08:07.822
Okay, okay, let me
try again. Let me try again.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.323
- Let me see it.
- You don't trust me?

08:09.532 --> 08:10.992
No, no, no, fine.
You can take it.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.494
Okay, let me see.
Photo approval.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.082
Fine.

08:21.461 --> 08:24.213
You are different than what
I thought you'd be.

08:24.672 --> 08:28.759
A former It Girl from
New York, made off
like a fall from grace?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.513
I assumed you'd
be high maintenance.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.184
Now tell me, what do you
miss most about home?

08:37.393 --> 08:38.478
Only everything.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.939
I forgot how exhausting
it is to be the new kid.

08:42.482 --> 08:46.652
Try being the new kid whose
dad is also the new teacher.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.112
And the new coach.

08:48.863 --> 08:51.574
Well, from an outsider's
point of view,

08:51.782 --> 08:53.451
you've not only
proven yourself,

08:53.659 --> 08:56.454
but you've raised the bar
for everyone around you.

08:56.913 --> 08:59.457
Varsity football, Dean's List.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.167
Ivy League aspirations.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.836
Oh, yes, you've been
vetted handsome.

09:04.045 --> 09:06.756
Veronica Lodge is nothing
if not an informed consumer.

09:09.175 --> 09:11.344
I'm gonna have my
hands full with you, huh?

09:12.136 --> 09:14.013
I'm betting you can handle it.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.861
Why did you tell them
about the gunshot?

09:29.070 --> 09:31.405
They were gonna crucify
Cheryl. I had to help her.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.407
You were in the clear.
We were in the clear.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.035
I left your name out of it.
So it's not that big a deal.

09:36.244 --> 09:39.622
No big deal, Archie?
You are caught up
in a murder investigation.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.917
What if Sheriff Keller
decides to keep digging,
and it somehow leads to us,

09:43.125 --> 09:45.795
- to our relationship?
- I'll stick to my story.
I'll protect you.

09:48.965 --> 09:50.132
I'm suspending our lessons.

09:51.342 --> 09:52.093
What?

09:52.718 --> 09:55.471
So, how'd it go with Chuck?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.598
Chuck has muscles for days,
but his conversation

09:57.807 --> 10:00.518
is not the stuff
of Oscar Wilde,
or even Diablo Cody.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.771
Hey, Veronica.
How was the Sticky Maple
you had last night?

10:03.980 --> 10:06.899
- The what now?
- The Sticky Maple
Chuck gave you?

10:07.108 --> 10:08.192
How was it?

10:08.401 --> 10:11.070
We had a brownie sundae,
if that's what you
hyenas mean.

10:15.116 --> 10:17.618
- Oh, my God.
- What?

10:20.538 --> 10:22.707
What the hell
is a Sticky Maple?

10:23.207 --> 10:26.335
It's kind of what
it sounds like.
It's a Riverdale thing.

10:26.544 --> 10:29.255
No, Kevin, it's a
slut-shaming thing.

10:30.006 --> 10:32.675
And I'm neither a slut,
nor am I going to be shamed

10:32.883 --> 10:35.803
by someone named, excuse me,
Chuck Clayton.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.306
Does he really think
he can get away with this?

10:38.514 --> 10:39.765
Does he not know who I am?

10:39.974 --> 10:42.768
I will cut the brakes on
his souped-up phallic symbol.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.729
Or we can go to
Principal Weatherbee.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.023
About the coach's son?
Who is captain of
the football team,

10:47.231 --> 10:48.983
and Riverdale High's
resident golden boy?

10:49.191 --> 10:52.028
Or I can expose him in the
pages of the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>
Yeah, I can do that!

10:52.236 --> 10:54.947
No. Spoken like a
true good girl who
always follows the rules.

10:55.531 --> 10:59.702
Well, I don't follow rules,
I make them, and when
necessary, I break them.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.079
You wanna help me get
revenge on Chuck,
Betty, awesome.

11:02.288 --> 11:04.498
But you better be willing
to go full dark, no stars.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.167
What do you say, in or out?

11:15.176 --> 11:16.135
Excuse me.

11:18.971 --> 11:19.639
Veronica?

11:20.598 --> 11:21.891
Betty, what are
you guys doing here?

11:22.475 --> 11:24.143
Don't worry about it.
I mean it, Andrews.

11:24.352 --> 11:26.270
Hit the showers
and stay out of my way.

11:31.651 --> 11:35.029
- Huh, B and V.
Menage a right on. Ladies.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.574
This is disgusting.
Take it down.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.077
Whoa, whoa. Why are
you so wound up?

11:41.285 --> 11:42.328
It's a badge of honor,

11:42.536 --> 11:46.248
and you're not exactly
virgin territory after your
closet date with Andrews.

11:46.457 --> 11:49.710
Okay, that's beyond
irrelevant, Chuck. You're not
allowed to go around

11:49.919 --> 11:54.173
humiliating girls,
for any reason, under any
circumstances, you jerk.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.051
Look, I get you're
not a closet kind
of girl, but hey,

11:57.259 --> 11:59.178
if you wanna ride
the Chuck Wagon,
that can be arranged.

12:00.554 --> 12:05.518
Let's keep this simple,
so that your preppy-murderer
half-brain can grasp it.

12:05.726 --> 12:06.769
Take.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.729
This. The hell.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.731
Down.

12:11.899 --> 12:16.362
Okay, that high-toned bitch
attitude may have
worked on the betas

12:16.570 --> 12:19.907
you dated in New York, but
you're in Bulldog territory.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.829
But please, fight back.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.793
You'll only make it
harder on yourself.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.093
<i>And in that
moment of hesitation,</i>

12:39.301 --> 12:43.389
you're dead.
All of you are dead.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.892
At ease, Doiley.

12:47.101 --> 12:49.854
I'm writing an article
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>
Hoping you can help.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.148
Dismissed.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.150
But stay close.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.905
Cheryl and Archie both say
they heard a gunshot
the morning of July 4th,

13:00.239 --> 13:01.073
but they don't know who fired.

13:01.282 --> 13:02.950
Sherriff Keller already
asked me about this.

13:03.159 --> 13:06.412
And like I told him,
my Scouts and I, we didn't
hear anything weird.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.625
Well, did you
see anything weird?

13:15.171 --> 13:18.799
A white-winged crossbill.
A long-eared owl.

13:19.008 --> 13:19.925
Oh.

13:21.010 --> 13:24.221
And Cheryl, sitting by
the river, soaking wet.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.769
Psst. Archie.

13:31.187 --> 13:33.522
Thanks to you, Archie, I'm not
the girl who cried gunshot.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.275
You believed me when
not even my parents did.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.319
I just told the truth.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.446
Which is why I want
to repay your kindness.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.115
Cheryl, truly, that's not
why I came forward.

13:43.491 --> 13:45.242
Save the, "Aw, shucks"
for Betty.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.953
I'm granting you
one wish, Archie.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.664
Nothing is off the table.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.042
Except for my body.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.129
Jason would want you
to be rewarded.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.344
Actually, there is one thing.

14:09.350 --> 14:10.476
Hey, Josie.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.896
I love my girl Cheryl,
so I am doing her this solid.

14:14.688 --> 14:18.818
She said that you needed help
with your music since
Ms. Grundy bailed on you.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.322
The Pussycats are
playing my mom's event,
The Taste of Riverdale,

14:23.531 --> 14:25.908
and we are rehearsing
every night this week.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.036
Come. Observe.

14:30.037 --> 14:30.996
Learn.

14:33.749 --> 14:37.086
This week I'm, uh,
I'm grounded.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.632
Yeah, okay, not your problem.
I'll make it work.

14:41.841 --> 14:42.758
Okay.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.219
Thank you.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.949
Hey, I've been
meaning to ask.
How was your date last night?

15:07.366 --> 15:08.492
I like the looks of that boy.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.829
The more handsome
on the outside, the more
rotten on the inside.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.748
What's that supposed to mean?

15:14.957 --> 15:17.251
Nothing, just that
he's not really my type.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.381
This is Betty. Can I take it?

15:22.590 --> 15:23.424
Yeah.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.217
Hello?

15:32.725 --> 15:34.184
This story is bigger
than we thought.

15:35.019 --> 15:37.938
I started asking around,
to see if what happened to you
happened to anyone else,

15:38.147 --> 15:39.607
and if anyone would
go on record.

15:40.149 --> 15:44.445
- I will. 100%.
- Okay.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.365
It's five guys
on the football team.
Chuck and his posse.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.159
Ethel was about to tell us...

15:51.201 --> 15:56.457
One day last year,
Chuck and I talked in
the library for 10 minutes.

15:57.082 --> 16:01.045
I helped him
with a Pre-Cal problem,
and nothing happened.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.381
But the next day, he...

16:05.466 --> 16:10.262
He started telling people that
I let him do stuff to me.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.598
Like, sex stuff.

16:13.891 --> 16:14.975
And then he...

16:16.185 --> 16:19.688
Or one of his goons,
wrote, "Sloppy seconds"
on my locker.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.232
Yes, yes, we've all heard
your tragic origin story.

16:22.775 --> 16:25.986
I'm so, so sorry, Ethel.
That's horrible.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.823
Not as horrible as being
a suspect in your own
brother's torture-murder case,

16:30.032 --> 16:31.825
but we all have our crosses.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.454
In the meantime, River Vixen
practice starts in five
minutes, sluts, so...

16:35.663 --> 16:38.457
They're ruining our lives,
and to them it's just a game.

16:39.917 --> 16:43.837
- They keep score and...
- Wait, what do you mean,
keep score?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.006
Each conquest earns
them points.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.133
They keep track
in some secret playbook.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.387
Okay, we have to talk
to Weatherbee.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.263
I already tried.

16:53.973 --> 16:55.516
Weatherbee said that
he didn't find anything.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.351
Okay, we need
undeniable proof.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.437
Proof of what, Nancy Drew?
That boys will be boys?

17:01.146 --> 17:03.691
And that playbook reeks
of suburban legend.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.359
How would you know, Cheryl?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.694
Because, Frida Shallow,

17:06.986 --> 17:10.364
before he died, my brother
was co-captain of
the football team with Chuck,

17:10.572 --> 17:13.909
and Jason never
mentioned it, and he never
would've allowed it.

17:14.118 --> 17:16.787
Okay, well, I never
met your brother,

17:17.371 --> 17:19.748
but I'm not lying about
what happened to me.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.458
And Ethel's not lying.

17:22.501 --> 17:25.379
And proof or no proof,
book or no book,

17:25.587 --> 17:29.550
I am going scorched earth
on these privileged,
despicable miscreants.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.635
You wanna get caught
in that backdraft, Cheryl?

17:32.720 --> 17:37.599
Call me, or any of these
beautiful, young, strong,
intelligent women...

17:39.059 --> 17:40.144
"slut"

17:41.228 --> 17:44.023
one more time.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.492
Right. Yeah, I'm gonna take
care of the check, all right.

17:55.701 --> 17:56.618
Save me some.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.294
- What the hell, man?
- I saw the way
you looked at me.

18:06.587 --> 18:07.755
During Grizzly training.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.091
You're hiding something.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.510
It's Scoutmaster Doily.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.388
- He's lying.
- About what?

18:16.597 --> 18:18.348
The gunshot. It was him.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.768
He was teaching us
how to shoot targets.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.775
Dilton Doiley shot
the gun on July 4th?

18:27.983 --> 18:29.902
He's a hardcore survivalist.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.154
He says if we don't protect
ourselves, no one will.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.419
Melody's our technique queen.

18:47.753 --> 18:48.796
And you're the songwriter?

18:49.922 --> 18:50.839
I would love to...

18:52.299 --> 18:53.383
Love to what?

18:55.844 --> 19:00.474
That's the real question.
What exactly you expect
to get out of this experience.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.561
Short version.
I just want to hear
you guys play my songs.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.438
Making them better.
Recording them.

19:07.397 --> 19:11.443
So, you feel
qualified to write songs
for the Pussycats?

19:13.195 --> 19:13.987
Yeah.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.907
- For divas of color?
- No.

19:18.659 --> 19:19.701
Maybe, maybe.

19:20.035 --> 19:24.123
Look, this isn't LA or
New York, this is Riverdale,

19:24.706 --> 19:28.627
and people's minds are
opening up, but do you
have any idea

19:28.836 --> 19:31.880
how much hate mail my mom got
when she was elected mayor?

19:32.089 --> 19:33.674
I campaigned for
your mom, I get it.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.260
No, no, no, baby, you don't.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.345
I mean do you know why
we're called the Pussycats?

19:39.429 --> 19:43.809
Because we have to claw
our way into the same rooms
that you can just waltz into.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.978
So, if you think that you
can write my experience...

19:46.186 --> 19:47.771
- Josie?
- It's okay, Valerie.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.315
She's right.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.526
Good.

19:57.114 --> 19:57.823
Ethel.

19:58.574 --> 20:01.451
Betty, you know
Trev Brown, right?
Valerie's brother?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.662
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.706
He used to be on
the football team.

20:06.582 --> 20:07.708
But I quit.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.586
When I saw Chuck's playbook.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.171
And I may know where it is.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.092
Football players behaving
badly, what else is new?

20:17.301 --> 20:18.886
Steubenville, Glen Ridge.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.806
The coach's son being
the ringleader. I mean, just
how depraved is this town?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.391
Color me impressed.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.186
A B and E with B and V.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.897
What would your holy roller
mother say about this, Betty?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.356
What are you
doing here, Cheryl?

20:31.565 --> 20:34.776
And where did you get
those thigh-high boots?
They're amazing.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.906
Trev told Valerie, who told
Josie, who told Ginger,
who told Tina, who told me.

20:39.114 --> 20:39.907
And I thought
I would help out.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.367
Help? Or derail
our investigation?

20:42.576 --> 20:43.827
Get over yourself, Betty.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.204
Hey guys, get in here.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.590
Trev was right.
They didn't even
bother to hide it.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.431
New girl? Is that
what I'm reduced to?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.227
- Nine points?
- Better than "Big girl."

21:08.727 --> 21:09.811
Seven point five.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.232
Polly's in this book...

21:15.651 --> 21:16.902
Next to Jason's name.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.199
I'm so sorry, Betty.

21:24.326 --> 21:28.247
- This isn't...
Jason would never...
- It's right there, Cheryl!

21:31.792 --> 21:32.709
God.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.836
Your brother hurt my sister.

21:35.963 --> 21:39.466
This is what guys like Jason
and Chuck think about women.

21:39.633 --> 21:42.469
We're objects
for them to abuse.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.930
And when they're done with us,
they shame us into silence.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.474
They have zero remorse
for the lives they destroy.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.811
Maybe I don't know Jason.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.863
I'll take a picture.
We'll show it to Weatherbee.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.491
It'll be the perfect cover
for your expose, Betty.

22:04.658 --> 22:09.496
Yeah, but... No. These girls
deserve justice, don't
you think, Cheryl?

22:12.165 --> 22:13.500
You want vengeance?

22:15.252 --> 22:18.005
You wanna go full dark,
no stars, Veronica?

22:18.630 --> 22:19.715
I'm with you.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.634
And I have a plan.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.727
Val, you are such a poet,
but these lyrics,

22:31.935 --> 22:35.981
they don't make sense.
What is the hook? I mean,
I need a line that catches.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.150
- I hear that.
- This...line.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.777
- I've been struggling.
- What about,
"Paintings in the wind"?

22:41.987 --> 22:44.573
How about,
"Paintings on her skin"?

22:46.366 --> 22:47.451
I kinda dig that.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.461
All right. Let's, uh,
take it from the top.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.715
One, two, one, two, three.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.347
<i>♪ Paintings on her skin
Colors in her hair</i>

23:08.764 --> 23:11.725
<i>♪ Come around the corner,
make you stop and stare</i>

23:11.933 --> 23:14.644
<i>♪ She don't pay no mind,
'cause she don't really care</i>

23:14.811 --> 23:18.523
<i>♪ What you think about her,
think about her</i>

23:21.360 --> 23:24.821
<i>♪ I don't care what
you want me to be</i>

23:28.033 --> 23:32.162
<i>♪ 'Cause it ain't for you,
no it's all for me ♪</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:38.752
That was... That was so good.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.379
What else you got?

23:40.754 --> 23:44.424
Uh, I was thinking
maybe we could invert
the second and third verses.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.605
Seduce Scarlet doesn't
suit you, dear.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.650
It's Polly's.
I'm borrowing it.

24:03.652 --> 24:06.405
Polly grew up too fast.
I don't want you to make
the same mistake.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.490
Well, I like it.

24:09.574 --> 24:10.742
It makes me feel...

24:12.536 --> 24:13.620
powerful.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.838
You coming with us
to the Mayor's shindig?

24:24.172 --> 24:24.965
No.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.427
I'm going over to Veronica's
to study for a test.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.556
I don't want you associating
with a girl like that.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.435
A bad girl, you mean?

24:37.602 --> 24:39.729
Get used to it, Mom.
She's my friend.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.903
Here. Pink Perfection.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.321
It's more you.

25:14.014 --> 25:14.973
Hey, Chuck.

25:16.308 --> 25:17.350
Can I sit?

25:18.435 --> 25:20.061
Not if you wanna
discuss Veronica.

25:21.897 --> 25:23.815
Only insofar as...

25:25.817 --> 25:27.235
I've been thinking lately...

25:28.069 --> 25:29.529
How I wanna be more...

25:30.530 --> 25:31.490
like her.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.783
You wanna be a bad girl?

25:35.285 --> 25:36.328
Maybe.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.788
Like your sister Polly was?

25:40.207 --> 25:42.584
Oh, yeah, Jason told us
all about Polly.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.670
You know, prissy prude by day,
freak in the sheets by night.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.964
Bad girls have
more fun, right?

25:49.716 --> 25:50.509
Yeah.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.972
Maybe you can show me.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.936
Yes. Yes, I...
I can do that. Um...

26:01.436 --> 26:02.812
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.898
- Uh, your place or mine?
- Ethel's.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.235
She and her
parents will be out.
She'll leave us a key.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.320
We're friends.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.822
And she has a pool...

26:14.366 --> 26:15.325
And a hot tub.

26:18.537 --> 26:19.621
I'll be there.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.583
Definitely. Um.
Hey, and don't worry.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.377
I'll be gentle.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.463
- Can't wait.
- Hmm.

26:46.147 --> 26:49.734
Welcome home, Ferris.
Sneaking out, breaking curfew.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.611
Getting into fights.

26:51.820 --> 26:54.823
Dad, don't freak out, okay.
I was with Josie, helping
the Pussycats with a song

26:55.031 --> 26:57.033
they're doing at that
Taste of Riverdale thing.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.704
- And I was hoping
you would let me go.
- No, Archie.

27:00.912 --> 27:03.039
You don't get to go
wherever you want,
whenever you want,

27:03.248 --> 27:04.624
and damn what
anyone else says.

27:04.833 --> 27:09.045
Dad, this is the first time
a song I worked on is gonna be
performed in front of people.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.257
On stage.
Please, let me go to this,

27:12.465 --> 27:14.217
and then ground me for
the next six months, a year.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.929
- We're not haggling over your
punishment, end of story.

27:18.138 --> 27:18.888
Fine.

27:19.514 --> 27:20.682
But you have to own it.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.434
Own what?

27:22.642 --> 27:25.645
Okay, if I had a football game
tomorrow night, would you
stop me from going?

27:27.314 --> 27:31.610
No, because football you
understand. You respect.

27:31.818 --> 27:35.488
But my music, since I told you
about it, you don't care.
You don't take it seriously.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.367
This is not about my behavior.
This is about your behavior.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.577
We're done here.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.721
You're not Betty.

27:59.929 --> 28:05.602
Betty and I talked it over,
and we decided it's time
to stop fighting over Archie,

28:05.810 --> 28:08.313
and start learning to share.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.030
- Nice.
- Isn't it?

28:17.238 --> 28:19.908
It gets very, very hot.

28:23.662 --> 28:24.579
Come on.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.458
Let's get wet.

28:30.710 --> 28:34.005
Uh, should we wait
for Betty to get here first?

28:51.856 --> 28:53.066
Betty couldn't make it.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.902
So she sent me instead.

29:02.450 --> 29:06.996
<i>Welcome all, to the first

29:07.664 --> 29:11.000

29:16.297 --> 29:20.593
<i>when tragedy knocks us down,

29:20.802 --> 29:23.096
Bon appetit.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.980
Well, well, well,
Hermione Lodge.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.066
- Fred Andrews.
- You look like
you could use this.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.944
May I try a blue cheese
slider, please?

29:38.153 --> 29:39.362
Of course.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.867
Hey, you're the music teacher
at the high school, right?

29:44.534 --> 29:47.954
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Fred Andrews,
Archie's dad.

29:49.622 --> 29:50.665
Can we talk?

29:54.419 --> 29:56.755
Penelope? Clifford?

29:58.465 --> 30:00.925
Hey. How are you holding up?

30:01.384 --> 30:02.552
How do you think?

30:02.761 --> 30:06.848
My son is dead, and neither
of you have done anything
to catch his killer,

30:07.056 --> 30:08.808
except, of course,
harass my daughter.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.853
Penelope Blossom. I thought
I might run into you.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.480
Would you like to give me
a quote regarding the...

30:14.647 --> 30:18.693
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right.
- How dare you, Alice Cooper!

30:18.902 --> 30:20.945
Printing my son's autopsy?

30:21.780 --> 30:25.909
He was tortured and shot,
and thrown in the river
like a piece of garbage.

30:26.117 --> 30:28.119
Hey, hey, hey.
Leave it. Leave it.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.206

31:30.056 --> 31:32.517
Archie says you're great.
Very supportive.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.937
That's very sweet of him.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.481
I need you to tell me
the truth about something.

31:39.607 --> 31:43.319
I know my son
has passion for music.
Does he have any talent?

31:44.112 --> 31:45.738
See, I want to
be supportive,

31:45.947 --> 31:48.074
but as a parent,
it's really hard to watch

31:48.283 --> 31:50.076
your kid chase a dream
they may never catch,

31:50.243 --> 31:52.203
when real-life opportunities
are passing them by.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.622
Mr. Andrews, Archie...

31:55.707 --> 31:57.876
He has talent. Unquestionably.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.629
I'm not gonna lie to you.
He is coming to it late.

32:01.838 --> 32:03.756
And he's got a lot
of catching up to do.

32:03.965 --> 32:07.677
And there's an entire world
of competition out there.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.556
Will he be able
to make a living at it?

32:13.850 --> 32:15.852
It'd be a shame
if he didn't at least try.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.648
<i>♪ Nothing can shake her... ♪</i>

32:20.857 --> 32:22.150
You know, I gotta ask you.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.612
What made you take such
an interest in my son?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.452
Archie's a special kid.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.127
<i>Okay, we're gonna do
something a little different.</i>

32:48.468 --> 32:51.220
Alice Cooper. No longer
lactose intolerant, I see.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.473
How's Veronica?

32:55.642 --> 32:58.686
Oh. You don't even
know, do you?

32:59.520 --> 33:02.398
The things that they're saying
about your daughter at school?

33:03.816 --> 33:06.110
- What things?
- Slut-shaming.

33:06.945 --> 33:09.656
That's what they call it
when sluts get shamed.

33:13.159 --> 33:17.080
You know, you really
have to keep an eye
on girls like Veronica.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.582
They so easily can
get out of control.

33:24.879 --> 33:27.131
- What is that?
- Muscle relaxer.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.510
Mix it with booze and it
lowers your inhibitions.
Hello, truth serum.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.845
Maybe we should
slow it down a little?

33:33.054 --> 33:35.640
It's fine. Right, Chuck?

33:38.893 --> 33:41.187
You don't want to
slow down, do you?

33:41.771 --> 33:44.190
Oh, I'm <i>2 Fast 2 Furious,</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:46.025
Good.

33:46.901 --> 33:47.986
Good boy, Chuck.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.159
Hello, Dilton.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.706
I talked to one
of your Scouts.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.166
I know you fired the gun.

34:03.418 --> 34:06.129
Which makes you both
a liar, and a public menace.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.384
So what if I did?

34:12.593 --> 34:14.303
I was doing
the Adventure Scouts a favor.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.390
Somebody has to teach them
how to stand their ground.
The way this town is going...

34:17.598 --> 34:19.225
Save it for your statement.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.936
Which you can make
to Sheriff Keller, or to me.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.604
I suggest the latter.

34:24.731 --> 34:26.691

34:38.578 --> 34:40.079

34:42.707 --> 34:44.792
Hey, guys. It's

34:45.001 --> 34:46.836
And getting hotter
by the minute.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.422
Time to squeal, pig.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.966
Tell the truth about
what happened between
you and Veronica.

34:53.051 --> 34:55.219
We had a good time.
She had a good time.

34:55.428 --> 35:00.016
The truth, Chuck, or so help
me, I will boil you alive.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.019
What?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.396
- We made out.
- And then?

35:07.231 --> 35:08.357
And then I took her home!

35:08.608 --> 35:10.276
And I didn't give her
a Sticky Maple.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.195
That is all you had
to say, you ass.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.781
And now, everyone will know.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.327
You like shaming
people, Chuck?

35:19.535 --> 35:21.537
- Whoa, hey...
- You like
dehumanizing them?

35:21.746 --> 35:24.457
- Okay!
- Prissy prude by day,
freak in the sheets by night?

35:24.665 --> 35:26.626
- No!
- Apologize.

35:26.834 --> 35:27.960
- Hey, get this...
- Calm down.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.879
- Say you're sorry!
- Okay!

35:30.088 --> 35:31.297
Okay, I'm sorry!

35:31.506 --> 35:32.965
I'm sorry for all of it!

35:33.174 --> 35:34.217
Good job, pig.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.012
Now, time for your reward.

35:39.222 --> 35:40.807
A Sticky Maple of your own.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.058
Wait! What, what?

35:42.266 --> 35:44.602
Apologize for ruining Polly.

35:45.853 --> 35:48.272
- What the hell? Oh, my God!
- Do it, Jason!

35:48.481 --> 35:50.358
Say you're sorry
for destroying me.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.653
- Apologize for what
you did to me!
- Look, I'm not Jason!

35:53.820 --> 35:56.072
- I'm not Jason!
- Betty, that is enough!

35:56.280 --> 35:57.824
Stop, it's over!

35:58.032 --> 35:59.534
We did it. You did it.

36:00.952 --> 36:02.078
You are crazy.

36:02.286 --> 36:03.663
Oh, my God!
You're crazy as hell!

36:04.330 --> 36:05.248
Betty?

36:07.542 --> 36:08.626
I'm fine.

36:12.964 --> 36:13.923
We're done here.

36:25.059 --> 36:26.644
Dad?

36:31.149 --> 36:32.859
Dad, what's going on?

36:33.401 --> 36:36.737
Well, I am soundproofing
the garage.

36:37.321 --> 36:41.576
I figure, you know, while
you're grounded, you
should at least be productive.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.661
Practicing your music.

36:45.413 --> 36:47.874
Dad, this is awesome.
Thank you.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.253
I met your music teacher
last night. Yeah, Ms. Grundy?

36:52.795 --> 36:55.965
Whoa. They did not look
like that in my day, son.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.011
Ah, what were you
guys talking about?

37:01.179 --> 37:02.138
You.

37:04.515 --> 37:05.808
She believes in you, Archie.

37:07.351 --> 37:08.394
So do I.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.492
Quite the expose.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.621
Whenever did you find
the time to write it?

37:27.079 --> 37:29.373
Stayed up all night.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.125
Couldn't sleep after...

37:32.376 --> 37:33.544
Me neither.

37:35.004 --> 37:35.630
Betty...

37:36.797 --> 37:38.966
You came through for me,

37:39.467 --> 37:41.886
in a way that no one
else ever has before.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.055
But...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.432
Can we talk about
what happened?

37:47.600 --> 37:48.559
What do you mean?

37:49.727 --> 37:52.396
The wig and everything.

37:53.564 --> 37:55.900
How far were you
gonna take it?

37:56.108 --> 37:59.070
- Chuck deserved it.
- You called him Jason.

38:02.531 --> 38:06.494
- Know what? I didn't do that.
- Yeah, girl, you did.

38:06.702 --> 38:10.581
You called yourself Polly.
It was like Dr. Jekyll,
Mistress Hyde.

38:11.082 --> 38:12.583
You became another person.

38:14.585 --> 38:16.128
Okay, I mean...

38:16.754 --> 38:18.965
I remember saying Chuck
should apologize for Polly,

38:19.173 --> 38:21.884
but not because I
thought he was Jason.

38:22.093 --> 38:23.761
- Why then?
- Because...

38:23.970 --> 38:27.556
I'm sick of guys like Chuck
and Jason doing horrible
things to girls like me,

38:27.765 --> 38:30.059
you, and Polly. Okay?

<i>had been forged.</i>

40:01.025 --> 40:02.234
<i>They walked through the fire,</i>

40:03.027 --> 40:04.070
<i>and survived.</i>

40:06.947 --> 40:08.866
Whoever killed Jason hurt him.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.827
Maybe Jason hurt people, too.

40:13.162 --> 40:14.872
If he hurt Polly, I'm sorry.

40:27.968 --> 40:29.303
Archie?

40:32.056 --> 40:33.224
I, uh...

40:34.934 --> 40:36.811
I wanted to thank you
for talking to my dad.

40:37.686 --> 40:38.938
I meant what I told him.

40:39.939 --> 40:41.816
I think it could
really happen for you.

40:47.405 --> 40:48.364
So...

40:51.409 --> 40:52.910
Does this mean we can

40:53.619 --> 40:55.830
start our lessons
back up again?

40:56.330 --> 41:00.042
<i>We crave absolutes.
They comfort us,</i>

41:01.001 --> 41:03.671
<i>but life is infinitely more
complex than that.</i>

41:04.338 --> 41:07.341
If you publish a story
saying I fired that gun,
my life will be ruined.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.052
I'll be banished from
the Adventure Scouts,

41:10.261 --> 41:12.054
and charged
with a misdemeanor.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.182
So, what if I have
a better story?

41:18.269 --> 41:21.272
If I tell you what I know,
promise me the gunshot
stays between us.

41:24.608 --> 41:27.111
You have our word.
As journalists.

41:29.864 --> 41:31.907
I saw something
at Sweetwater River.

41:32.366 --> 41:33.784
Something nobody else saw.

41:35.911 --> 41:37.037
Ms. Grundy's car.

41:37.830 --> 41:38.914
By the river's edge.

41:41.792 --> 41:42.793
She was there.

41:43.043 --> 41:45.004
<i>Despite all of our
recent troubles,</i>

41:45.212 --> 41:47.381
<i>I would've done anything
to protect Archie.</i>

41:47.923 --> 41:51.093
<i>But Dilton Doiley had just
opened Pandora's box,</i>

41:51.427 --> 41:56.849
<i>and now, there was
nothing I, or anyone,
could do to save him.</i>
