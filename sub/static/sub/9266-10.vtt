WEBVTT

00:00.106 --> 00:01.968
And I break it down
to its component parts.

00:01.968 --> 00:04.801
- A chop shop.
- How much money we talking about?

00:04.803 --> 00:07.559
You'll make more money in two months
than you could in two years.

00:07.595 --> 00:09.381
- Who's that?
- That's ryan.

00:09.416 --> 00:11.260
Is there something
you want to tell me about ryan?

00:11.295 --> 00:13.447
I will say that I feel
a lot better.

00:13.664 --> 00:15.416
Look, I've got some bad news.

00:15.618 --> 00:17.742
I'm pregnant,
and it's yours.

00:17.777 --> 00:19.704
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

00:19.739 --> 00:24.052
- And I'm so scared.
- Come here.

00:28.078 --> 00:30.705
I am filled
with pride and love

00:30.739 --> 00:33.199
As I look out
over this congregation.

00:33.235 --> 00:36.293
And there is our own star
on the football field,

00:36.328 --> 00:37.990
Luke Cafferty.

00:43.082 --> 00:46.805
Thank you, luke, for making
your congregation so proud.

00:46.841 --> 00:49.001
- Amen.
- Thank you.

00:49.036 --> 00:51.696
Let us pray.

00:51.731 --> 00:53.991
Our father who art in heaven...

00:54.026 --> 00:56.053
Hallowed be thy name,

00:56.089 --> 00:59.314
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

01:15.184 --> 01:17.345
Well, awesome.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.541
I believe this belongs
to you, sir.

01:19.575 --> 01:21.803
- All right.
- Appreciate it again, huh?

01:21.837 --> 01:23.100
I'll see you soon.

01:23.135 --> 01:25.528
I can't take any more
of these skeletons.

01:26.761 --> 01:29.121
- What do you mean? Why not?
- I think you can guess.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.118
I ain't asked any questions
about where you been getting

01:31.152 --> 01:32.382
These car frames
you've been bringing in.

01:32.416 --> 01:35.010
But I ain't real interested
in the cops surprising me either.

01:35.045 --> 01:37.373
You keep showing up
with these stripped cars,

01:37.407 --> 01:40.067
They're gonna show up too.

01:40.175 --> 01:41.630
All right.

01:41.665 --> 01:43.826
- Sorry.
- Yeah, don't be.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.855
Thank you.

01:49.084 --> 01:50.313
Let the tight end clear.

01:50.348 --> 01:52.808
Slot receiver crosses
underneath, you hold.

01:52.842 --> 01:55.036
You hit the third receiver.
He's gonna be running the delay.

01:55.072 --> 01:57.166
All right, so that third
receiver's taking too long,

01:57.200 --> 01:57.974
And then, like,
the defense is in my face--

01:57.976 --> 02:00.526
Listen to me.
You let the tight end clear.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.788
Slot receiver
crosses underneath.

02:02.822 --> 02:03.918
You hold.

02:03.954 --> 02:07.744
You hit the third receiver.
He's running a delay.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.941
Can you see that?

02:09.975 --> 02:11.437
- Yeah.
- You can see that?

02:11.471 --> 02:12.501
- I can see it.
- You can see it?

02:12.536 --> 02:14.098
- Yes, sir.
- You understand that?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.463
Yeah, coach, I got to go,

02:15.497 --> 02:18.955
'cause mr. Merriweather's
not a happy man when I'm late.

02:19.888 --> 02:22.082
Hey, I want you to know
this stuff sooner than later.

02:22.118 --> 02:24.046
Yes, sir.

02:24.314 --> 02:26.673
- How you doing, coach?
- I'm doing good. How are you?

02:26.708 --> 02:27.971
How's the kid doing?

02:28.006 --> 02:29.700
You know, showing up on time,
doing the work.

02:29.736 --> 02:31.664
So I see you're doing
a delay drag.

02:31.698 --> 02:33.893
So you're gonna start
putting in timing patterns.

02:33.927 --> 02:36.366
Thinking about it, yeah.

02:40.514 --> 02:43.872
Looking forward
to the game.

02:45.936 --> 02:48.231
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

02:48.564 --> 02:50.561
How you doing?

02:52.390 --> 02:55.350
Well, I woke up this morning,
and I'm still pregnant,

02:55.384 --> 02:57.255
So had better days.

02:58.744 --> 03:01.537
Kind of puts that b-minus I got
in geography into perspective.

03:01.571 --> 03:03.538
Talk to your mom yet?

03:04.388 --> 03:07.281
No.

03:12.578 --> 03:13.989
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

03:14.149 --> 03:15.275
You need to talk
to your mom.

03:15.276 --> 03:17.257
Why?

03:18.602 --> 03:20.514
She'll understand.

03:21.987 --> 03:23.833
You don't know her.

03:30.722 --> 03:32.186
Come on.

03:32.222 --> 03:34.439
- Where are we going?
- Give me your hand.

03:34.474 --> 03:36.490
Trust me.

03:36.571 --> 03:38.028
Let's go.

03:41.493 --> 03:44.541
- Hey, tim. How are you?
- Hi, mrs. Taylor. Good.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.084
- Um, sorry,
coach isn't here right now,

03:46.085 --> 03:48.167
But he should be back probably
in a couple hours or so.

03:48.169 --> 03:50.094
- Yeah, I'm actually here
to talk to you.

03:50.210 --> 03:52.033
- Okay.
Everything all right?

03:52.068 --> 03:53.792
I need your help.

03:54.938 --> 03:58.214
Come on in. - It's actually
for a friend of mine.

04:04.798 --> 04:07.923
- Have y'all talked
about your options at all?

04:07.959 --> 04:11.184
- Oh, tim's not the father.
- We're just friends.

04:14.112 --> 04:15.775
Um, tim, you know, I think
it would be a good idea

04:15.809 --> 04:17.637
For you to wait outside
for a moment,

04:17.672 --> 04:19.267
Give becky and I some privacy.

04:19.303 --> 04:21.298
- Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.459
I'll be outside.

04:29.448 --> 04:31.509
Have you told your parents?

04:31.544 --> 04:33.805
No.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.735
Okay.

04:35.769 --> 04:37.897
Do you think it would put you
in any kind of harm,

04:37.932 --> 04:40.059
Any kind of physical
or emotional harm,

04:40.094 --> 04:41.390
If you were to tell them?

04:41.424 --> 04:43.119
- No.
- Okay.

04:43.154 --> 04:44.550
It's just me and my mom.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.177
I just--I just haven't been able
to tell her yet.

04:48.211 --> 04:51.503
- Well, I think my first
suggestion is gonna be

04:51.538 --> 04:53.565
For you to try to find a way
to tell her

04:53.601 --> 04:54.630
As soon as you can.

04:54.665 --> 04:57.525
I think that's gonna be
real important.

04:57.559 --> 04:59.188
Okay.

04:59.223 --> 05:01.017
Okay?

05:01.053 --> 05:04.111
Does the father know?

05:04.146 --> 05:07.271
Yeah, he does, but...

05:07.307 --> 05:08.936
I barely know him,

05:08.970 --> 05:14.125
And I don't love him
or anything. And...

05:14.159 --> 05:16.220
It's just like this whole thing
is a bad dream and--

05:16.255 --> 05:17.485
I understand.

05:17.519 --> 05:19.247
- I just keep wanting it
to go away.

05:22.942 --> 05:25.502
What should I do?

05:25.537 --> 05:28.862
- Um, you have
free medical assistance

05:28.897 --> 05:30.691
Available to you
throughout your pregnancy.

05:30.727 --> 05:31.956
There's a teen clinic.

05:31.991 --> 05:34.683
They're real helpful
and knowledgeable there.

05:34.719 --> 05:39.608
I can refer you
to the adoption agency,

05:39.642 --> 05:42.169
- Uh, that's local here.
- What if I don't--

05:42.203 --> 05:45.927
What if I don't want
to have the baby?

05:45.963 --> 05:48.856
- I can direct you
to literature...

05:48.890 --> 05:50.951
For that.

06:43.981 --> 06:45.177
Let's go now, 5.

06:45.212 --> 06:46.940
Good splits now.
Come off the ball.

06:53.229 --> 06:55.623
- Vince, come here.
- Bring it in!

06:55.657 --> 06:58.184
- Look, you're gonna want
to rush this play--don't.

06:58.219 --> 06:59.615
Let the receivers clear.
Understood?

06:59.649 --> 07:01.777
- What about the offensive line?
They're not blocking.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.008
- Why don't you just worry
about the lanes

07:03.042 --> 07:04.871
And worry about your own job--
how's that?

07:04.906 --> 07:08.232
Come on, now, son.
Let's go.

07:08.265 --> 07:10.292
- Come on, you got this, 5.
Let's go. Call it.

07:10.328 --> 07:11.923
- These guys
got to get it together.

07:11.958 --> 07:12.955
I mean, this is...

07:17.280 --> 07:20.173
Oh, shazam.

07:28.459 --> 07:31.718
- He get his feet under him,
he'll be all right.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.981
Big mary.

07:33.016 --> 07:35.143
Mary, mary, quite contrary.

07:35.179 --> 07:36.475
How y'all doing?

07:36.509 --> 07:37.971
What's up, baby?

07:38.006 --> 07:40.233
- How's it going out there?
- Not too good, man.

07:40.269 --> 07:42.961
- Vince would be lucky
to hit water from a boat today.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.491
- Pre-snap protection, now.
Come on!

07:44.527 --> 07:47.386
- Let's do it!
- Give him some time. Let's go!

07:47.421 --> 07:49.382
- That kid can run
like the wind, brother.

07:49.417 --> 07:50.713
Not as fast as virgil was.

07:50.747 --> 07:53.707
Nobody cut upfield
like you did, boy.

07:53.741 --> 07:57.099
- They're not very good,
are they?

07:58.698 --> 08:00.693
What is this?

08:00.727 --> 08:03.819
I mean, I--honestly,
I bet I could sue them

08:03.855 --> 08:04.818
For false advertising.

08:04.853 --> 08:06.581
What is this?
This is crap.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.509
This is not even something
that should go into our bodies--

08:09.543 --> 08:11.704
I'm pregnant.

08:15.531 --> 08:17.826
That's not even funny, becky.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.921
Why would you s--

08:33.395 --> 08:37.552
No, you're not.
What--

08:47.434 --> 08:50.194
- Oh, damn it!
You're kidding me, right?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.658
You're not kidding me?

08:51.693 --> 08:55.883
You're telling me right now
that you're pregnant?

08:55.918 --> 08:58.045
Oh, damn it, becky!

09:05.426 --> 09:05.930
Did she go down all right?

09:05.964 --> 09:08.358
- Yeah, after four books
and a few stories,

09:08.393 --> 09:09.623
I had to crawl
out of the room again.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.153
- That's
what it takes nowadays.

09:11.187 --> 09:12.582
- She's getting smart
like that.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.113
Hey!

09:14.148 --> 09:15.610
- Hey, shh!
- Don't slam the door.

09:15.645 --> 09:18.105
- Is grace already asleep?
- Yes, you missed her.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.600
And you missed dinner.

09:20.635 --> 09:21.865
- I was just busy.
Sorry.

09:21.899 --> 09:23.162
- So busy.
- Busy?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.592
You're always busy.
- Busy, busy all the time.

09:24.627 --> 09:25.890
In the busy place.

09:25.924 --> 09:27.320
So speaking of being busy,

09:27.355 --> 09:29.150
Uh, Wednesday night
when we have dinner,

09:29.184 --> 09:30.879
I invited a friend over.

09:30.914 --> 09:32.577
Oh, what kind of a friend?

09:32.611 --> 09:35.537
- Um, do you remember
that guy ryan?

09:35.572 --> 09:37.467
He works for habitat--
- right, I remember ryan.

09:37.501 --> 09:38.831
Okay.
- Yeah, he's gonna come over.

09:38.865 --> 09:41.425
But I got to go do homework,
and I love you guys.

09:41.461 --> 09:42.557
Talk to you later.
- Love you.

09:42.591 --> 09:43.953
Nice talking to you.

09:43.988 --> 09:45.716
- Don't wake her up.
- I'm not gonna wake her up.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.779
- How old is that kid?
- I don't know, honey.

09:47.815 --> 09:49.810
That's not gonna last.
I can tell you that right now.

09:49.844 --> 09:52.670
It's a rebound.

09:52.704 --> 09:55.597
So one thing
I got to tell you, though.

09:55.632 --> 09:57.493
Tim riggins
came over here today

09:57.528 --> 09:59.222
With a girl
from east dillon high.

09:59.258 --> 10:01.419
- Came over here?
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.454 --> 10:02.517
- What did he
come over here for?

10:02.551 --> 10:05.377
'cause she was pregnant.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.673
- Tim riggins
is gonna be a father?

10:07.708 --> 10:08.871
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:08.905 --> 10:10.168
I know. That's what
I thought too, but, no.

10:10.203 --> 10:12.830
Uh, no, they said
he's not the father.

10:12.865 --> 10:15.392
But it was his girlfriend?

10:15.426 --> 10:18.485
No, I don't think it was.
I don't know.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.082
I think they were friends
or something.

10:20.117 --> 10:21.978
It was very--
it was very strange, honey.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.342
Well, wait a second.

10:23.377 --> 10:26.402
Why did he--
why did he come over here?

10:26.437 --> 10:28.100
- I don't know
what his involvement is.

10:28.134 --> 10:31.825
I'll tell you one thing, though.
She needed someone to talk to.

10:33.490 --> 10:35.617
- Did it go all right?
- I think so.

10:35.652 --> 10:37.114
You know, I did
what I'm supposed to do.

10:37.149 --> 10:39.609
I told her
about some of her options

10:39.644 --> 10:43.635
And told her she should talk
to her parents.

10:54.381 --> 10:56.542
hey, mom.

10:56.577 --> 10:59.171
I brought you home
some barbecue--

10:59.205 --> 11:02.863
Ribs, chicken, greens,

11:02.898 --> 11:05.824
'cause I don't eat nothing
compared to you.

11:05.858 --> 11:08.252
mom.

11:10.882 --> 11:13.875
Mom.

11:17.335 --> 11:19.962
Mom.

11:24.421 --> 11:26.814
Mom?

11:26.850 --> 11:28.845
Mom?

11:33.237 --> 11:36.163
Hey, hey.
Mom.

11:36.198 --> 11:39.689
Hey--hey, I need an ambulance
to 2609 chavez,

11:39.724 --> 11:41.552
Apartment 23.

11:56.756 --> 11:59.150
Hey.
- Hey.

12:02.579 --> 12:04.540
What happened?

12:04.575 --> 12:08.465
- Hey.
- Hmm?

12:08.500 --> 12:12.424
You o.D.'d.

12:12.458 --> 12:16.515
You had
a little bit too much.

12:16.551 --> 12:19.510
The doctor's got you sedated,

12:19.545 --> 12:23.502
And, um...

12:23.537 --> 12:27.959
You--you're gonna be
just fine.

12:27.995 --> 12:29.490
Mm-hmm.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.953
You're gonna be all right.

12:30.989 --> 12:33.915
Come here.

12:33.949 --> 12:35.345
Give your mother a hug.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.710
No, mom.

12:36.744 --> 12:38.606
No.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.492
It's so
you won't hurt yourself.

12:45.526 --> 12:48.685
Oh.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.812
Okay.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.641
Okay.

13:01.062 --> 13:04.420
- Mom.
- Hmm?

13:04.456 --> 13:08.280
- Why do you keep doing this
to yourself?

13:17.430 --> 13:20.256
Why do you
keep doing this to me?

13:20.290 --> 13:23.748
I mean, am I that bad?

13:26.577 --> 13:29.903
why don't you
want to be with me?

13:32.167 --> 13:36.025
Why do you--why do you want
to leave me by myself?

13:36.059 --> 13:39.084
Because...

13:39.120 --> 13:43.310
I don't know if I...

13:43.344 --> 13:46.869
I don't know
if I can do it by myself.

13:46.903 --> 13:49.198
Baby...

13:50.629 --> 13:53.290
- I can't do it by myself,
mom.

14:04.389 --> 14:05.718
Hey, how you doing?

14:05.753 --> 14:07.780
- Fine.
Everything's awesome.

14:07.815 --> 14:09.344
Let me.

14:09.379 --> 14:12.338
Can we talk, please?
- About what?

14:12.373 --> 14:13.978
- You know what
I want to talk about.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.408
- You haven't told anyone,
have you?

14:15.443 --> 14:16.805
- No.
- 'cause that is seriously

14:16.841 --> 14:18.436
The last thing
I need right now.

14:18.470 --> 14:19.999
I didn't. I--

14:20.034 --> 14:21.696
- Look, I haven't made
the appointment yet.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.891
So just stop hassling me.
- Okay. I'm not hassling you.

14:23.927 --> 14:27.485
- This is my problem, and I'm
figuring it out on my own, okay?

14:27.519 --> 14:29.414
So you just need
to forget about it.

14:29.448 --> 14:30.645
I can't.

14:30.679 --> 14:32.308
- Well, that's what
I'm trying to do.

14:32.342 --> 14:33.738
Hey, becky.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.601
- Hey. How's it going?
Hey, did you do your homework?

14:35.636 --> 14:40.125
Oh, cool, can I copy it?
Thanks.

14:40.161 --> 14:42.288
- So I replaced the timing belt.
That was $110, all right?

14:42.322 --> 14:45.115
I checked all the fluids.
I checked all your hoses.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.746
And just threw in
a, uh, free oil change--

14:46.781 --> 14:48.776
- Hey, billy, what you got
going on here?

14:48.810 --> 14:50.871
- Hey! What are you doing?
Don't touch that!

14:50.906 --> 14:53.000
What are you doing?

14:53.034 --> 14:55.162
Chill, man.

14:55.197 --> 14:56.494
- Fixing cars
is delicate, man.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.955
I don't need you walking
around here touching on things.

14:58.989 --> 15:00.817
- Just relax.
He didn't even touch anything.

15:00.853 --> 15:02.182
I was looking at him
the whole time.

15:02.217 --> 15:04.311
- Yeah. So it's, uh,
$140 all together.

15:06.841 --> 15:09.201
All set.

15:09.236 --> 15:11.995
- Texas law requires
that I inform you

15:12.030 --> 15:15.189
Of the probable gestational age
of your pregnancy

15:15.224 --> 15:17.318
At the time that we plan
to do the procedure.

15:17.352 --> 15:19.913
Now, you can estimate the age
by counting--

15:19.948 --> 15:21.410
- We get it, doctor,
all right?

15:21.445 --> 15:24.237
I'm sorry.

15:24.273 --> 15:26.234
This isn't necessary.

15:26.269 --> 15:29.494
You don't have to go through
the whole procedural options,

15:29.529 --> 15:30.891
Blah, blah, blah.

15:30.926 --> 15:33.087
She's not having a baby.
She's having an abortion.

15:33.121 --> 15:34.983
- I understand. I just--
this is state mandated,

15:35.018 --> 15:36.547
Everything that I'm saying.

15:36.581 --> 15:38.343
- I'm just trying to save
everybody some time.

15:38.378 --> 15:40.606
There's no point in going
through all the details.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.202
I don't care
what the state mandates.

15:42.237 --> 15:44.065
We really don't need
to hear this information.

15:44.099 --> 15:45.595
- After I finish
telling this information,

15:45.630 --> 15:48.090
Then she can decide
what she wants to do.

15:48.125 --> 15:51.882
- She's already decided
what she wants to do.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.247
Unbelievable.

15:53.281 --> 15:55.176
I'm supposed to listen
to some right-wing doctor

15:55.211 --> 15:57.172
Give me a trip,
take another day off from work

15:57.207 --> 15:59.267
So he can tell us
we're trash.

15:59.303 --> 16:01.164
"oh, you got a teenage
daughter who's pregnant.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.994
You must be trash too."

16:03.029 --> 16:04.424
It's so insulting.

16:04.459 --> 16:06.320
- I'm sorry!
- You don't--

16:06.356 --> 16:08.683
- I'm sorry!
- Becky. Becky.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.544
Becky...
It's all right.

16:11.578 --> 16:13.540
It's all right.
You are gonna be fine.

16:13.574 --> 16:15.635
Listen to me--
you are gonna do this.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.632
And you're gonna live
your life,

16:17.666 --> 16:20.792
And this is not--you're not even
gonna think about it anymore.

16:20.826 --> 16:22.521
Okay?
You don't have to be sorry.

16:22.556 --> 16:25.116
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.144
You're gonna be fine.

16:28.178 --> 16:29.607
[sniffles]

16:32.270 --> 16:34.265
- Hey, excuse me.
- Uh-huh?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.327
- You're in charge
of the rehab programs, right?

16:36.362 --> 16:38.291
- No, but I can help you
with it.

16:38.325 --> 16:39.754
- Well, the nurse said
I should talk to you

16:39.789 --> 16:41.052
About getting my mom
into rehab?

16:41.086 --> 16:42.814
- What's your mom's name?
- Regina howard.

16:42.849 --> 16:45.143
- You're looking
at a 30-day inpatient program.

16:45.177 --> 16:47.472
- Okay.
- Here, let me see.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.033
Um, looks like we have
an opening around...

16:50.068 --> 16:52.063
The beginning of the yea

16:52.098 --> 16:53.993
Okay?

16:54.027 --> 16:55.589
- But I'm pretty sure you guys,
you know,

16:55.624 --> 16:57.651
Get cancellations
all the time or whatnot,

16:57.686 --> 16:59.648
Because my mom--
she needs help now.

16:59.682 --> 17:01.511
- I'm sorry, but the state
residential centers

17:01.545 --> 17:03.074
Have a really long
waiting list.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.505
So there are cancellations,

17:04.539 --> 17:07.767
But you're still probably
looking at around January.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.365
- January.
- Yeah.

17:09.398 --> 17:12.724
There are also private
rehab centers out there.

17:12.759 --> 17:15.551
- Okay.
- Like...

17:15.587 --> 17:16.849
This is one.

17:16.884 --> 17:20.175
They almost always
have openings, okay?

17:20.211 --> 17:22.205
This looks pretty expensive.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.569
Yeah.

17:26.499 --> 17:27.728
[quietly] yeah.

17:28.352 --> 17:29.957
- You know
what your problem is?

17:29.991 --> 17:32.052
- No, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.483
What is my problem?

17:33.518 --> 17:36.344
- Your problem is you don't know
how to coach vince.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.642
I don't know how to coach?

17:37.676 --> 17:38.839
- Mm-mm.
Didn't say that.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.236
Said you don't know
how to coach vince.

17:40.271 --> 17:41.600
You don't know
how to talk to him.

17:41.635 --> 17:42.964
- Look, you're not
looking at me

17:42.999 --> 17:44.328
And telling me
that I can't coach vince

17:44.363 --> 17:45.892
Because he's black
and I'm white, are you?

17:45.926 --> 17:47.621
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

17:47.656 --> 17:49.118
- I'm saying I might be
seeing some things

17:49.154 --> 17:51.448
That you might be missing.
- See, now, this is one of those

17:51.482 --> 17:53.444
Supremely irritating
conversations that we have.

17:53.478 --> 17:55.938
Are you seeing it
because you're black?

17:55.973 --> 17:58.732
- Look, I don't understand vince
because I'm black.

17:58.768 --> 18:00.995
I understand him
because he's me.

18:01.029 --> 18:02.159
Do you know
what it's like to be

18:02.194 --> 18:03.623
The most athletic guy
on the field

18:03.657 --> 18:05.385
And then be told,
"don't follow your instincts.

18:05.421 --> 18:09.578
Follow the playbook,
no matter what"?

18:18.828 --> 18:20.124
- What the hell
am I supposed to do?

18:20.158 --> 18:21.188
What do you want me to do?

18:21.223 --> 18:22.685
The kid's got to learn
the plays.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.315
- Look, I know he has to know
the plays--I'm not stupid.

18:24.349 --> 18:25.624
- Telling me I can't coach
my kids because they're black.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.342
- Would you stop it with that?
- I know the kid's got talent.

18:27.343 --> 18:28.761
I'm just trying to give him
a skill set.

18:28.763 --> 18:31.815
- I know that.
- Well, you know what?

18:31.851 --> 18:34.695
Telling me I can't coach Because
you don't like what I do on the field.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.023
- Can we have two more, robin?
- You got it.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.819
I do appreciate you...

18:38.854 --> 18:40.882
Callin'
a cab last night, honey.

18:40.917 --> 18:43.976
But I think you need to face
the realities about your age,

18:44.011 --> 18:46.571
Which is that you can't go
drinking like that

18:46.606 --> 18:48.401
On a school night.

18:48.435 --> 18:50.462
Where is your car?
- Wait. Stop.

18:50.498 --> 18:52.958
- Well, where is your car?
- Just stop.

18:52.993 --> 18:54.455
I'm stopped.

18:54.490 --> 18:57.515
You don't even remember
what bar you were at, do you?

18:57.550 --> 18:59.445
Go around back.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.705
- Okay.
Good lord.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.701
You need to not feel like you
got to drink everybody

19:04.736 --> 19:06.564
Down under the table--
- it's right there.

19:06.599 --> 19:10.490
So it is.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.252
- There it is.
- Mm-hmm.

19:12.288 --> 19:14.216
Right.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.243
- You gonna take me
to my car?

19:17.278 --> 19:19.638
- I think you can walk.
A walk will do you some good.

19:19.673 --> 19:21.401
Are you serious?

19:21.436 --> 19:25.427
Fresh air in your hair.

19:25.461 --> 19:28.187
- Love you.
- Love you too.

19:28.222 --> 19:30.915
- Hope you feel better today.
Love you!

19:30.951 --> 19:32.912
Feel better today!
- All right, see you later.

19:32.947 --> 19:35.706
Bye!

19:39.200 --> 19:40.629
- Billy, we can't keep
doing this.

19:40.665 --> 19:42.725
We're begging to get busted.
- I know. I get it, okay?

19:42.761 --> 19:44.556
I'm not a moron.
- The cops are gonna show up.

19:44.591 --> 19:46.352
- What do you want to do?
- Figure something out.

19:46.387 --> 19:47.650
- Billy?
- That's what I want to do.

19:47.684 --> 19:49.546
- Yeah, baby, I'm coming!
One second.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.109
It's getting too risky.

19:51.143 --> 19:53.338
- I get it, okay?
I get it.

19:53.373 --> 19:54.868
Hey. Hey.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.496
We could, uh...
We could, like, you know,

19:57.531 --> 19:59.259
Drive them off a cliff.

19:59.294 --> 20:01.056
They have no engines, billy.

20:01.091 --> 20:02.919
We've stripped them
and sold them.

20:02.954 --> 20:06.046
Good call.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.675
Oh, hey, tim.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.972
I got another idea.

20:10.006 --> 20:12.034
We can take them out
to the lake,

20:12.069 --> 20:13.598
Just take the car frames
out to the lake

20:13.632 --> 20:14.862
And just dump them
in the lake.

20:14.896 --> 20:16.658
- Yeah, billy,
just strap 'em on my back.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.856
I'll swim out there.

20:17.890 --> 20:19.618
We could bury 'em.

20:19.654 --> 20:21.848
We could just take 'em out
in the middle of nowhere

20:21.882 --> 20:26.072
And just dig a big-ass hole
and just bury them.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.533
- That's a lot of work.
- Yeah, it's a lot of work.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.694
It's a lot of money we're making
off these things.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.321
It's a lot of trouble if we
don't find a place for 'em.

20:39.647 --> 20:42.107
- Guess we'll bury 'em.
- All right.

20:46.001 --> 20:49.093
So, ryan, um, how long
Were you in indonesia for?

20:49.129 --> 20:51.189
Uh, maybe two months?

20:51.224 --> 20:54.050
First month, we just spent
clearing earthquake debris,

20:54.085 --> 20:55.780
And then we started rebuilding
people's houses,

20:55.815 --> 20:58.442
And it was just--
I mean, an amazing experience.

20:58.477 --> 21:01.003
- And was all that
for school credit?

21:01.038 --> 21:03.897
- Started out that way,
and then...

21:03.932 --> 21:07.356
You know, I kind of wanted
to take an extended leave,

21:07.392 --> 21:10.318
Got hooked, and just been
traveling ever since.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.549
Mm.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.378
- Did you know
you can travel the whole world

21:13.413 --> 21:15.241
Working for habitat,
rebuilding houses?

21:15.276 --> 21:16.505
Yes, honey.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.534
So, coach, uh,

21:19.568 --> 21:22.062
Julie tells me
you coach football.

21:23.527 --> 21:27.717
I heard, uh, the other day
it was gonna rain on Friday.

21:27.751 --> 21:30.345
You know, how was that?

21:30.379 --> 21:32.806
How's what?

21:32.841 --> 21:35.335
- Yeah, I mean,
it must be weird, you know?

21:35.369 --> 21:38.395
Everyone out there
in the rain,

21:38.430 --> 21:41.090
Playing football.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.417
You know?
It's raining...

21:44.451 --> 21:46.479
- Yeah, it can get
pretty weird.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.775
- Are you gonna stay in town
or, um...

21:48.809 --> 21:51.868
I'm gonna get some more
of these popovers.

21:51.903 --> 21:54.198
- No, uh...
Well, actually,

21:54.232 --> 21:56.625
I'm the team leader
of a new building project,

21:56.660 --> 21:59.253
So I'm gonna leave
to arizona next week.

21:59.289 --> 22:00.585
Oh, that's a shame.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.348
But you know what?
Arizona's a beautiful place.

22:02.382 --> 22:03.944
- That is beautiful there
in arizona.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.741
Dry.
- It's a desert, honey.

22:05.775 --> 22:08.070
- Mm-hmm. Very dry.
- I've never been, but...

22:13.327 --> 22:15.022
She ain't here.

22:15.056 --> 22:18.315
- Well, actually,
I came to talk to you.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.873
Come on.

22:29.061 --> 22:31.988
Sir, I know this is gonna
sound a little suspect...

22:32.023 --> 22:35.780
Seeing as I just now
started working for you, but...

22:35.815 --> 22:39.539
I'm gonna need an advance
on my check.

22:39.574 --> 22:41.768
Why?

22:41.803 --> 22:45.594
It's nothing bad.

22:45.629 --> 22:48.721
How much?

22:48.755 --> 22:51.349
4 grand.

22:51.384 --> 22:54.344
- So what kind of trouble
you in?

22:54.378 --> 22:58.236
It's not me.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.032
Between you and I?

23:00.067 --> 23:02.760
Yeah.

23:02.794 --> 23:06.352
- I've been trying to get my mom
checked into a rehab center.

23:06.388 --> 23:07.983
Uh-huh.

23:08.018 --> 23:10.279
Well, don't they have
programs, you know,

23:10.313 --> 23:11.909
For lower-income housing?

23:11.943 --> 23:13.905
They're all full.

23:13.939 --> 23:17.064
List--the whole city's
trying to get on that list.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.959
- Well, how is she?
- She's not good.

23:23.187 --> 23:25.747
- I...I can't give you
an advance, vince.

23:25.782 --> 23:27.144
[stammers]

23:27.179 --> 23:29.639
Son, I just don't have it.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.270
Look here.
I want you to hear this.

23:31.304 --> 23:32.800
Hear me now.

23:32.834 --> 23:36.127
I'm saying no to the money,
but not to you.

23:36.161 --> 23:39.054
I'm proud of you for coming
to me and asking me,

23:39.089 --> 23:40.518
'cause I know it ain't easy,

23:40.552 --> 23:42.680
And I know you trying to do
something with your life now.

23:42.715 --> 23:45.741
And I want you to know
I believe in you.

23:45.776 --> 23:47.837
We'll figure this out.

23:47.871 --> 23:50.298
Okay.

23:52.528 --> 23:54.124
All right.

23:54.158 --> 23:57.484
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:03.839 --> 24:06.665
How come you believe in him?

24:06.701 --> 24:08.063
Past three years,
you been saying

24:08.098 --> 24:10.558
That vince ain't nothing
but a no-good lowlife,

24:10.592 --> 24:15.348
And suddenly you find it so
necessary to be there for him.

24:15.383 --> 24:18.575
I can never get you
to come to caleb's games

24:18.610 --> 24:20.737
Or show up to the lions' games

24:20.773 --> 24:22.634
When I'm dancing
on the sidelines

24:22.669 --> 24:26.660
Or come to my academic smackdown
when I'm scoring points.

24:26.694 --> 24:28.223
But...

24:28.257 --> 24:32.181
You want to go
and watch vince practice.

24:32.217 --> 24:35.808
And you're proud of him.

24:38.703 --> 24:42.628
I try really hard
to make you proud too.

24:52.443 --> 24:53.972
[whispers] babe.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.796
[louder] babe.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.758
Hmm?

25:02.622 --> 25:04.783
Hey, honey?

25:04.818 --> 25:05.981
What?

25:06.015 --> 25:08.143
- [whispering] what do you think
julie would do

25:08.178 --> 25:10.672
If she got pregnant?
- What?

25:10.706 --> 25:12.967
- She's not pregnant, honey.
She's not pregnant.

25:13.001 --> 25:14.896
But what do you think
she would do?

25:14.932 --> 25:17.492
- [whispering]
what are you doing?

25:17.526 --> 25:19.587
- I mean, would she--
would she talk to us?

25:19.622 --> 25:22.183
She would talk to us,
wouldn't she?

25:22.217 --> 25:24.045
What would she do?

25:24.079 --> 25:25.508
- Oh, babe,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

25:25.544 --> 25:27.338
- You think she'd feel
comfortable talking--

25:27.373 --> 25:28.702
You want to talk about julie

25:28.737 --> 25:30.232
And having
a hypothetical pregnancy.

25:30.268 --> 25:32.428
Are you crazy?
That's just wrong.

25:32.463 --> 25:34.258
- Honey, we're both
having nightmares.

25:34.293 --> 25:36.653
- Well, don't do that.
Come to bed.

25:36.687 --> 25:38.915
Come to bed.

25:38.950 --> 25:41.710
Come.
Y'all come to bed.

25:47.234 --> 25:49.627
Can't sleep?

25:49.662 --> 25:51.657
- Uh-uh.
- How's the hip?

25:51.691 --> 25:55.049
- It's good.
- Something's bothering you.

25:55.084 --> 25:57.012
I don't know what it is.

25:57.047 --> 26:00.106
I'm not gonna pry
if it's none of my business.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.435
I'm good.

26:02.470 --> 26:06.294
Is it football?

26:06.329 --> 26:08.024
I'm your dad.

26:08.058 --> 26:11.616
If something's bothering you,
it's bothering me.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.825
- There's a girl,
and I got her pregnant.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.454
I got a girl pregnant.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.802
I really didn't mean
to disappoint you.

26:35.836 --> 26:38.031
I'm sorry.

26:42.482 --> 26:46.406
- Vince, come here.
Come here.

26:46.441 --> 26:47.404
Yes?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.967
Look, this series,

26:49.003 --> 26:50.632
I don't want you
waiting on your reads.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.494
If you see something you like,
you take it, understood?

26:52.529 --> 26:54.690
- But I thought you said--
- don't worry about what I said.

26:54.725 --> 26:57.218
Worry about what I'm telling
you right now, understood?

26:57.253 --> 26:59.447
Yeah.

26:59.481 --> 27:02.142
- We good?
- Yeah. Good.

27:02.176 --> 27:04.138
- Okay, they're running
wing trips, double slant.

27:04.172 --> 27:05.734
I want you to run
to the slant,

27:05.770 --> 27:07.399
And I want you to knock
vince on his ass.

27:07.433 --> 27:09.194
- I don't get it, coach.
Why are you telling us the play?

27:09.229 --> 27:11.124
- I'm telling you because
I want you to sack vince,

27:11.158 --> 27:12.687
And if you can't do that now,

27:12.722 --> 27:15.116
You really are
a bunch of jug butts.

27:15.150 --> 27:16.446
- Ready.
[group claps]

27:27.193 --> 27:28.954
Ready. Set.

27:28.989 --> 27:30.618
Hut, hike.

27:42.263 --> 27:43.925
- Let's go, son.
That's it.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.488
Good job.

27:45.523 --> 27:49.148
Let's go. Hustle up!
Hustle up!

27:49.183 --> 27:50.212
Let's go!

28:22.210 --> 28:23.440
Hey.

28:23.474 --> 28:26.566
- Your father told me
what's happened.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.861
- I couldn't keep something
like this from your mother.

28:28.897 --> 28:30.658
It's okay, luke.

28:30.693 --> 28:32.554
Mary and joseph thought

28:32.588 --> 28:34.450
They were in a situation, too,
at first.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.314
- Becky and me
are not mary and joseph, mom.

28:36.348 --> 28:39.739
- Becky.
That's her name?

28:39.775 --> 28:42.467
Well, we need
to meet this becky,

28:42.503 --> 28:45.429
And then we'll figure out
what to do.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.995
- How did you figure out
how to get up here?

29:02.030 --> 29:03.791
Well, anywhere I go,

29:03.826 --> 29:06.586
I look
for the tallest building

29:06.621 --> 29:08.749
Or vantage point
or whatever,

29:08.783 --> 29:11.377
And I try to find
a way up.

29:15.037 --> 29:17.164
This is pretty good.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.993
It's higher up
than any building

29:20.027 --> 29:21.788
In pavones, costa rica.

29:21.824 --> 29:23.951
- What's the best place
you've ever been?

29:23.987 --> 29:26.647
Oh, that's easy.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.939
Senegal, west africa.

29:29.975 --> 29:33.466
I'll show you.

29:33.501 --> 29:37.657
Which is maybe 9,000 miles
that way,

29:37.692 --> 29:39.587
Which would make oaxaca

29:39.622 --> 29:42.082
1,000 miles
in this direction

29:42.116 --> 29:47.970
And new york
1,500 miles that way.

29:48.005 --> 29:49.967
What about you?

29:50.001 --> 29:51.331
Where are you headed...

29:51.365 --> 29:53.093
Eventually?

29:54.958 --> 29:57.618
Eventually...

29:57.653 --> 30:00.812
I don't know.

30:00.846 --> 30:01.875
Do you hate it here?

30:01.911 --> 30:06.001
I used to hate it,

30:06.036 --> 30:10.392
And then I just...

30:10.427 --> 30:12.089
Kind of changed.

30:14.119 --> 30:15.847
I guess I just--

30:15.883 --> 30:17.677
I really want to see
the world.

30:17.713 --> 30:20.406
And that sounds
really cliche.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.131
No. No, it doesn't.

30:30.187 --> 30:31.217
Look.

30:31.252 --> 30:32.216
What?

30:32.250 --> 30:34.078
That's you...

30:34.113 --> 30:37.738
Seeing the world.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.520
- It's really beautiful
up here.

31:08.079 --> 31:09.641
- [breathlessly]
this is the...

31:09.676 --> 31:12.734
Stupidest thing we've ever done.
[shovel digging]

31:12.770 --> 31:15.196
Stupidest thing
we've ever done by far.

31:15.231 --> 31:17.458
- I don't want to hear about it
right now, tim.

31:19.822 --> 31:23.447
- This hole--never gonna
be big enough, billy.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.678
You know what, man?

31:24.712 --> 31:26.973
I am sick
of your lame-ass attitude!

31:27.008 --> 31:28.869
God, I mean...

31:28.903 --> 31:31.364
You got to make it a hundred
times worse than what it is!

31:31.399 --> 31:33.327
Is this
a bad situation? Yes!

31:33.362 --> 31:35.989
I mean, are we doing
everything that we can

31:36.023 --> 31:37.685
To get out of it?
You bet your ass we are!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.648
I don't understand
what the point

31:39.682 --> 31:41.810
Of jumping on my case
about it is every five seconds!

31:41.845 --> 31:43.939
The point is, I'm done.

31:43.974 --> 31:45.036
I'm done.

31:45.072 --> 31:47.465
We've made our money.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.961
We've made it
and then some.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.788
Promise me we're out.
This is it.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.217
No more illegal crap,
no more chop shop.

31:55.251 --> 31:56.913
We're done.
It's over, billy.

31:59.975 --> 32:02.502
Let's just go back
to fixing cars.

32:05.398 --> 32:07.193
Riggins rigs,
brothers, that's it.

32:07.228 --> 32:08.723
Keep it simple.

32:08.758 --> 32:11.019
Promise me that.
We're done.

32:15.444 --> 32:17.739
Okay.

32:17.773 --> 32:19.103
Okay.

32:20.734 --> 32:22.695
Okay.

32:22.730 --> 32:25.489
And I want you to stop
yelling at me

32:25.525 --> 32:27.219
Because I didn't go
to college.

32:27.255 --> 32:29.549
Okay.

32:29.583 --> 32:30.713
Anything else?

32:30.747 --> 32:32.609
- Yeah.
[billy laughs]

32:35.205 --> 32:38.231
And I also want to be
a partner.

32:38.266 --> 32:41.492
Maybe.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.252
I'm kidding.

32:44.287 --> 32:46.315
Okay.
- Okay.

32:50.740 --> 32:52.369
- Just 'cause
you're a partner

32:52.404 --> 32:53.833
Doesn't mean
I can't tell you to dig,

32:53.868 --> 32:56.029
So let's...

32:56.063 --> 32:57.625
Let's dig.

33:45.365 --> 33:47.294
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:47.328 --> 33:48.990
Is miss taylor here?

33:49.025 --> 33:51.152
Yeah, she is.

33:51.186 --> 33:54.345
- Oh, hey.
Come on in.

33:54.381 --> 33:56.441
Um, it's all right.

33:56.476 --> 33:58.105
Go on into the kitchen.

33:58.139 --> 34:00.499
- I'm really sorry
I woke you guys up.

34:00.534 --> 34:01.697
- It's okay.
It's all right.

34:01.733 --> 34:04.193
Go on back to bed,
sweetheart.

34:04.227 --> 34:06.255
- I have an appointment
for my abortion tomorrow.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.817
My mom knows.
She's coming with me.

34:08.851 --> 34:11.543
Good.

34:12.909 --> 34:16.634
So why do I feel
so weird?

34:18.764 --> 34:21.092
'cause it's a hard thing.

34:21.126 --> 34:25.683
This is a hard situation.

34:25.717 --> 34:29.043
Have you thought
about what you want?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.099
We don't have any money.

34:34.135 --> 34:37.592
I'm in the tenth grade.

34:39.291 --> 34:42.715
It was my first time...

34:42.751 --> 34:45.244
[voice breaking]
and I threw it away,

34:45.279 --> 34:50.067
And I don't want to throw
my life away.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.764
It was just...
It was just really obvious

34:51.799 --> 34:55.489
That my mom wants me
to have this abortion...

34:55.525 --> 34:58.317
Because...
Because I was her mistake.

34:58.353 --> 35:02.210
And she has to just struggle
and hurt every day,

35:02.245 --> 35:05.004
And she wanted better,
and I knew better,

35:05.039 --> 35:07.799
And I was just thinking,
you know, forget what she wants.

35:07.834 --> 35:09.463
Like, what do I want?

35:09.498 --> 35:11.459
And maybe I could
take care of this baby,

35:11.494 --> 35:14.054
And maybe
I would be good at it.

35:14.088 --> 35:17.946
And I could love it,
and I would be there for it.

35:17.980 --> 35:21.737
And then I was just thinking
about how awful it would be

35:21.773 --> 35:23.202
If I had the baby,

35:23.237 --> 35:27.660
And then I spent the rest
of my life resenting him...

35:27.694 --> 35:29.689
Or her.

35:33.050 --> 35:36.774
Do you think I'm going to hell
if I have an abortion?

35:36.810 --> 35:39.536
No, honey, I don't.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.777
- What would you
tell your daughter?

35:58.433 --> 36:00.694
I would tell her...

36:06.517 --> 36:09.942
To think about her life...

36:12.106 --> 36:15.065
And think about
what's important to her

36:15.100 --> 36:17.028

whatever decision she made.

36:37.156 --> 36:39.383

of a baby.
