00:29.686 --> 00:31.555
That's Julie's dance studio right there.

00:35.514 --> 00:36.960
She'll be out soon.

00:44.357 --> 00:47.186
- She has a big recital coming up.
- Do you have pliers?

00:47.221 --> 00:51.374
- What for?
- Huh, that antenna, it's bent.

00:51.409 --> 00:52.850
So what?

00:53.563 --> 00:56.987
Well, we could straighten it out.
It'll just take a second.

00:57.022 --> 00:59.714
Well, it's none of our business.
Forget about it.

00:59.749 --> 01:02.120
I happen to believe
that all men are brothers.

01:02.845 --> 01:07.743
Every man's bent antenna
diminishes me.

01:07.778 --> 01:10.047
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:12.075 --> 01:13.871
Maybe he likes it like that.

01:13.906 --> 01:15.978
You don't know.
Maybe he did it himself.

01:16.013 --> 01:18.047
He didn't bend his own antenna.

01:18.082 --> 01:20.649
People don't like things bent.

01:20.684 --> 01:24.765
People like things straight.
Nice and straight. And even.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.693
I'll tell you what people
like, Mr. Monk.

01:26.728 --> 01:29.391
People like people
who mind their own business.

01:29.426 --> 01:30.947
Every time I poke
my nose some place,

01:30.982 --> 01:33.105
I end up regrettin' it.
It's bad karma.

01:34.765 --> 01:36.486
I will be right back.

01:38.564 --> 01:39.937
Stay here.

01:41.413 --> 01:43.324
Stay.

01:45.151 --> 01:46.826
Good boy.

02:58.918 --> 03:01.185
MONK Season 3 Epi. 12
Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever

04:04.034 --> 04:07.818
- Why couldn't we stay in the city?
- Because a man there wants you dead.

04:07.853 --> 04:08.921
Right, I know.

04:08.956 --> 04:12.015
And that man packs a lot of
muscle in the Bay Area.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.242
I know.

04:13.277 --> 04:16.103
That's why they have
a witness protection program.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.627
Captain, please stay in the vehicle
until we get to the cabin.

04:22.662 --> 04:23.980
What are you afraid of, Grooms?

04:24.015 --> 04:25.943
A sharp-shooting raccoon
with a high-powered rifle?

04:25.978 --> 04:27.319
All right, this is not a joke, Captain.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.235
Tommy Win has already had
two other federal witnesses killed.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.241
I know he has.
That's why I'm here.

04:33.456 --> 04:36.614
Miss Teeger, please.
Stay in the vehicle. - No.

04:37.374 --> 04:40.960
All right, you can stretch your legs.
Just don't call any attention to yourself.

04:40.995 --> 04:44.582
Good advice coming from a guy wearin' a
three-piece suit in the middle of the woods.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.982
- Where are we?
- You're safe, that's where you are.

04:48.017 --> 04:49.815
How long do we have to stay here?

04:49.850 --> 04:52.755
- Until the deposition on Monday.
- Six days.

04:52.790 --> 04:53.866
You're doing God's work.

04:53.901 --> 04:57.191
We finally have Tommy Win behind bars,
and thanks to you, he's gonna stay there.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.019
Six days, piece of cake.

05:00.183 --> 05:03.032
- What? Are you okay?
- I should tell you.

05:03.611 --> 05:07.707
- I'm afraid of places.
- You're always someplace.

05:09.068 --> 05:11.846
This is your own fault.
You should have stayed in the car.

05:11.881 --> 05:13.407
Now we're in the middle of nowhere,

05:13.442 --> 05:16.589
my kid has to stay with my parents and
she is missing a whole week of school.

05:16.624 --> 05:18.725
You've got some drug lord
with a price on your head

05:18.760 --> 05:20.707
plus you broke that guy's antenna.

05:20.742 --> 05:23.518
I know you mean well,
but you're bad karma.

05:25.252 --> 05:29.260
Bad karma. Yeah, bad, bad.

05:32.224 --> 05:35.276
Look, are you thirsty? - Yes.

05:35.898 --> 05:39.212
Uh, here. I've got some water.

05:39.247 --> 05:41.467
I... I brought two cases in the back.

05:41.502 --> 05:45.332
I can only drink
Sierra Springs. - What?

05:45.367 --> 05:47.981
What, is it like some
medical thing? - Yes.

05:49.018 --> 05:52.541
- Bought the wrong water.
- All right, look. Make it fast.

05:52.576 --> 05:54.048
Make it fast.

05:54.568 --> 05:56.361
Hey, Monk, now remember,

05:56.396 --> 05:58.673
as long as you're here,
your name is Conway.

05:58.708 --> 05:59.882
Frank Conway.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.758
We made up an ID for you.

06:01.793 --> 06:04.789
Wait, he doesn't look like me.

06:04.824 --> 06:08.472
That's a picture of you. - It is?

06:12.092 --> 06:14.599
Excuse me, do you carry
Sierra Springs bottled water?

06:14.634 --> 06:17.467
In the cooler.
Help yourself. - Thanks.

06:18.761 --> 06:20.479
You folks just passin' through?

06:20.514 --> 06:23.280
I'm... I'm a hunter.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.159
I'm gonna do some hunting.

06:27.559 --> 06:31.570
The season doesn't start
for three months. - I know.

06:31.605 --> 06:35.193
Uh, I like to get here early,
get a good spot.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.367
What are you gonna do,
squat in the woods for 12 weeks?

06:39.035 --> 06:40.737
Kathy? - What?

06:40.772 --> 06:45.173
It's none of our business. This gentleman
isn't poking his nose into your life, is he?

06:45.208 --> 06:47.285
He can ask me anything he likes.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.062
I've got nothin' to hide.

06:49.559 --> 06:52.257
Turn that up!
Martin hates country music.

06:52.292 --> 06:54.185
He never lets me play it at home,
ain't that right, darling?

06:54.220 --> 06:57.313
That is why the good lord
invented headphones.

06:57.348 --> 07:00.686
Oh, Martin, I got those dipsy-diggitys
you were asking about.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.244
Oh, thank you much. - Yeah.

07:03.279 --> 07:06.485
Yeah. The best bass lure
in the whole world.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.321
Yeah, every lure you buy
is the best lure in the world.

07:10.356 --> 07:12.791
Well, that's 'cause
they keep improving 'em.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.254
I'll take two.

07:14.289 --> 07:18.458
One for the fish and
one for my lucky hat.

07:19.384 --> 07:21.704
Okay, that'll be $22 even.

07:23.549 --> 07:25.381
$22 go

07:25.416 --> 07:26.899
Mr. Conway, we have to go.

07:30.558 --> 07:31.753
Mr. Conway?

07:35.939 --> 07:39.857
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway?

07:42.036 --> 07:43.200
Frank?

07:47.480 --> 07:48.950
Frank!

07:49.750 --> 07:53.313
Hello! Mr. Conway,
we have to go! - Sorry.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.039
I've been calling you
for five minutes.

07:55.723 --> 07:57.483
Then I should have answered you,

07:58.200 --> 07:59.454
because that is my name.

08:00.911 --> 08:02.537
Frank Conway.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.087
Thank you very much.

08:43.210 --> 08:45.092
The bureau's been using
this place for 30 years.

08:45.834 --> 08:48.543
Remember that guy that testified
against Marty Vincenzo?

08:49.088 --> 08:51.373
- He stayed here.
- Wasn't he killed?

08:51.408 --> 08:54.290
- Yep.
- Not here, he wasn't.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.218
Okay.

09:00.573 --> 09:03.310
Cell phones off and keep 'em off.

09:03.345 --> 09:05.726
Not that it matters.
There's no signal up here.

09:05.761 --> 09:09.689
- All right.
- The landline is for FBI use only.

09:09.724 --> 09:12.991
No calls in or out.

09:13.026 --> 09:18.968
As of this moment, we are
closed off from the outside world.

09:21.774 --> 09:24.743
- Can we see the rest of it?
- This is it.

09:26.218 --> 09:30.451
Look, I know it's not the Four Seasons,
but we've all seen worse.

09:31.128 --> 09:33.333
I actually don't think I have.

09:33.368 --> 09:38.048
It's no picnic for me, either, but I
suggest we all try to make the best of it.

09:38.083 --> 09:41.809
Try to think of it like a little
vacation, hmm? - Okay.

09:41.844 --> 09:43.350
I can't do this.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.953
I can't live like this.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.589
I wanna go home.

09:50.353 --> 09:53.081
You go home now,
you'll get shot in the head.

09:58.042 --> 10:01.068
- Shot in the head.
- Mr. Monk, you're not going anywhere.

10:01.103 --> 10:04.733
You're going to testify in open court
against Tommy Win on Monday

10:04.768 --> 10:07.497
and you're gonna stay
in this cabin until you do.

10:08.410 --> 10:10.630
I'm by the door. Miss Teeger,
you have the bedroom.

10:10.665 --> 10:14.550
Captain, you and Monk take
the bunk bed. - Huh?

10:27.819 --> 10:30.002
Top or bottom? - Oh.

10:37.377 --> 10:41.382
Um... - Okay, I'll flip a coin.

10:44.252 --> 10:48.023
Heads or tails? - Um...

11:05.741 --> 11:08.468
Hey, Monk, have a seat.

11:09.809 --> 11:11.760
I'll sit when I get home.

11:12.811 --> 11:13.867
Suit yourself.

11:18.181 --> 11:20.416
Hey there, Mr. Conway.

11:23.497 --> 11:25.822
You know, I could get used to this.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.262
Yeah, it's nice.

11:28.876 --> 11:31.057
You know what would
make it even nicer? - Hmm?

11:31.092 --> 11:33.004
If we were someplace else.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.911
Well, I'm gonna make the most of it.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.510
- Hey, guess what tomorrow is?
- It's your birthday, of course.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.022
Happy birthday to me.

11:48.463 --> 11:49.589
What the hell happened to me, Monk?

11:49.624 --> 11:52.242
I was supposed to be
the Deputy Commissioner by now.

11:53.698 --> 11:56.109
I was the fair-haired boy, remember?

11:56.144 --> 11:58.930
Youngest detective in the history
of the department.

11:58.965 --> 12:00.752
And now,

12:00.787 --> 12:03.331
I'm the guy that knows how to find you.

12:03.366 --> 12:07.092
- Oh, look, Captain, there isn't...
- Forget about it.

12:09.703 --> 12:12.866
- Say, how's Natalie workin' out?
- Oh, Natalie's great.

12:12.901 --> 12:14.834
Just pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

12:14.869 --> 12:16.305
I like her,

12:16.340 --> 12:21.136
I... I trust her, and
hey, I... I depend on her.

12:22.293 --> 12:24.433
She'll probably be quitting soon.

12:31.347 --> 12:35.433
Hey, uh, Monk, that's just dirt.
You can throw it anywhere.

12:35.468 --> 12:37.184
Oh, yeah.

13:09.134 --> 13:10.342
Go ahead.

13:37.209 --> 13:39.157
I really appreciate
you comin' out here.

13:39.192 --> 13:40.802
All the way here.
Especially on your birthday.

13:40.837 --> 13:42.961
- You didn't have to do this.
- Yes, I did.

13:42.996 --> 13:46.339
I don't trust these guys,
particularly not Grooms.

13:46.374 --> 13:49.384
You could have asked
Lieutenant Disher, or...

13:49.419 --> 13:52.859
I thought about that,
but he has a big date.

13:53.473 --> 13:54.541
The kid thinks he's in love.

13:54.576 --> 13:56.882
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.614
He's the one who ought
to be in protective custody.

14:06.639 --> 14:08.701
You are right.
This place is great.

14:08.736 --> 14:10.233
I used to come here
with my grandfather.

14:10.268 --> 14:12.298
We used to sit in
that booth over there.

14:13.068 --> 14:17.453
Well, I, uh, hope your grandfather wasn't
thinking what I'm thinking right now.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.102
Actually, my grandfather died last year.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.498
It's... It's funny.

14:28.965 --> 14:31.165
Every time I'm here,
it's like he's with me.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.805
Like I can feel him, his spirit.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.268
Thank you very much.

14:36.303 --> 14:37.514
Don't forget your cookies.

14:37.549 --> 14:40.979
My favorite part.
I'm taking this one. - Okay.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.567
What does it say?

14:43.646 --> 14:46.227
"True love has finally come your way."

14:46.663 --> 14:47.948
No way. It does not say that.

14:47.983 --> 14:50.169
- It does not say that.
- Yes, it does. Look. Read it.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.281
Wow. Maybe they know something.

14:54.316 --> 14:57.009
- Maybe they do. Okay.
- Here. Here is mine.

15:00.468 --> 15:03.415
"A friendly hand will
save you from a dirty death."

15:04.598 --> 15:07.100
Really? Wow, that's weird.

15:08.751 --> 15:11.382
- So what are you doin' tomorrow night?
- What are you doing in 20 minutes?

15:11.417 --> 15:14.336
- You like to move fast, don't you?
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.212
So what do you want
to name our first child?

15:16.625 --> 15:19.369
Okay, now you're
scaring me. Randy!

15:29.064 --> 15:31.513
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:31.545 --> 15:33.581
Ooh.

15:43.270 --> 15:47.242
"A friendly hand.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.273
A dirty death."

17:56.128 --> 17:57.392
You hear that?

17:58.101 --> 17:59.259
Thunder.

18:00.611 --> 18:02.599
I better pull the car around.

18:02.634 --> 18:06.010
I already did and I covered the boat.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.263
What on earth would
you do without me?

18:09.142 --> 18:11.623
You mean what would I do first?

18:12.896 --> 18:15.408
As soon as that insurance kicks in,

18:15.443 --> 18:17.329
I'd get me one of those new Lebarons,

18:17.364 --> 18:19.839
fully loaded, with leather seats.

18:19.874 --> 18:22.357
Yeah. Sounds like
you've been thinkin' about it.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.329
Only every waking minute.

18:25.422 --> 18:28.798
Then I'd take me one of
them cruises to Hawaii.

18:28.833 --> 18:32.008
Yeah, yeah, in your dreams.

18:34.415 --> 18:37.553
Oh, turn that off.
You know I hate that crap.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.556
Turn it off yourself.

18:52.102 --> 18:53.457
Did you hear that?

18:53.492 --> 18:55.231
Huh? Hear what?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.565
My leg.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.609
Untie my leg.

19:02.644 --> 19:05.617
Monk. Monk!

19:07.876 --> 19:09.409
Are you ready for your fortune?

19:09.444 --> 19:11.379
I don't know after the last one.

19:11.414 --> 19:14.283
Listen, I've been thinking
about my grandfather all day.

19:14.318 --> 19:17.514
I know it sounds crazy,
but before he died,

19:17.549 --> 19:19.896
he said he would
always look out for me.

19:19.931 --> 19:22.313
What if he's communicating with me,

19:22.348 --> 19:24.518
with us, through the cookies?

19:24.553 --> 19:27.889
Or What if it's just a coincidence?

19:28.598 --> 19:30.213
Hayley, I'm a cop.

19:30.248 --> 19:32.156
I'm gonna wait till
I see some real evidence.

19:32.191 --> 19:34.095
Okay, Lieutenant,

19:34.130 --> 19:36.490
let's check out Exhibit A.

19:39.065 --> 19:41.285
"Follow your heart."

19:41.320 --> 19:43.042
Yeah, that's kind of boring.

19:43.077 --> 19:44.279
My turn.

19:47.366 --> 19:50.619
"You will receive unexpected
money from your uncle."

19:51.461 --> 19:52.963
Sorry.

19:52.998 --> 19:54.976
It looks like your grandpa's
having an off day.

19:55.011 --> 19:56.894
- What do you mean?
- I don't have any uncles.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.956
Two aunts, but no uncles.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.634
Oh. It was fun while it lasted.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.470
Is that Adrian Monk the detective?

20:06.505 --> 20:07.968
Yeah. That's right.

20:08.003 --> 20:08.852
You know him?

20:08.887 --> 20:10.224
Yeah, we work together all the time.

20:10.259 --> 20:15.188
See, that's me.
And, uh, that's me.

20:15.223 --> 20:18.158
Is he really that smart?
I hear he's like Sherlock Holmes.

20:18.193 --> 20:20.609
Yeah, well, you know,
it's really a team effort.

20:20.644 --> 20:24.350
- I'd love to meet him.
- I'll introduce you.

20:24.385 --> 20:25.441
Really? - Yes.

20:25.476 --> 20:27.705
But not right away
because he's out of town.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.912
Oh, is he working on some case?

20:29.947 --> 20:31.829
Well, I'm not at liberty to say.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.462
It's confidential.

20:36.345 --> 20:37.514
- Mmm.
- Hang on.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.589
Randall Disher? - Yeah.

20:43.624 --> 20:46.672
Certified letter.
Sign right here.

20:48.262 --> 20:49.615
All right, thanks.

20:53.224 --> 20:54.992
Oh, it's from the IRS.

20:55.027 --> 20:57.528
Ooh, you are in trouble now.

21:03.379 --> 21:06.842
It's a check, for $2,400 dollars.

21:06.877 --> 21:08.898
- What?
- Yeah.

21:08.933 --> 21:09.904
It's a refund.

21:09.939 --> 21:13.931
It says that they've been miscalculating
my taxes or the past six years.

21:13.966 --> 21:15.306
Good old Uncle Sam.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.881
Good old Uncle Sam?

21:30.510 --> 21:32.856
She's carryin' two packages,
looks like ice.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.846
Exactly. She's been buying ice all day.
That makes 16 bags she's carried in so far.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.881
- Maybe she's havin' a party.
- No food!

21:38.916 --> 21:40.704
No beer, no chips, just ice.

21:40.739 --> 21:42.677
Maybe she's having
an Adrian Monk party.

21:42.712 --> 21:44.620
The only other thing
she bought today

21:44.655 --> 21:46.780
- was a new radio.
- What are you gettin' at?

21:46.815 --> 21:50.273
Plus, I am positive I heard a man
screaming at 1:15 last night.

21:50.308 --> 21:51.953
That was me.
You tied my foot to the bed.

21:51.988 --> 21:53.624
I mean before that.

21:53.659 --> 21:56.240
It was definitely coming
from that cabin.

21:57.612 --> 21:59.449
- What?
- Hear that? - What?

21:59.484 --> 22:03.356
She said her husband didn't let her
listen to country music in the house.

22:03.391 --> 22:04.825
Maybe he's not home.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.075
Well, where did he go?
There's his boat.

22:07.110 --> 22:09.422
- They only have the one car.
- Maybe he went on a walk.

22:09.457 --> 22:12.208
No, I have been watching
the house all day.

22:12.243 --> 22:16.025
Captain, I have not seen him.

22:35.329 --> 22:37.874
- It's ringing.
- Well, Agent Grooms said no calls.

22:37.909 --> 22:39.907
- Agent Grooms can kiss...
- Hello?

22:39.942 --> 22:42.539
Oh, hello, Mrs. Willowby.

22:42.574 --> 22:45.230
- Yes?
- Uh, is Martin there?

22:45.265 --> 22:46.792
My name is Darrell Hindershot.

22:46.827 --> 22:49.352
I'm a friend of Martin's.
We went to high school together.

22:49.387 --> 22:51.372
We're havin' a big high-school reunion.

22:51.407 --> 22:55.083
Oh, I'm so sorry.
He is on the lake, fishin'.

22:55.118 --> 22:57.741
Oh, okay. Well, I'll...
I'll try back, then.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.236
- You do that.
- Thank you very much.

23:01.274 --> 23:04.134
She says he's on the lake fishing.

23:04.169 --> 23:05.861
She killed him.

23:06.314 --> 23:07.843
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

23:07.878 --> 23:10.254
Can't I take you anywhere?

23:24.761 --> 23:26.793
She was playing country
music? - Oh, yeah.

23:26.828 --> 23:28.929
- And buying ice.
- That's right. About 20 bags.

23:29.622 --> 23:32.594
Okay, I've seen this before. You're
cooped up for a long time away from home

23:32.629 --> 23:34.818
under a lot of stress,
you begin to imagine things.

23:34.853 --> 23:37.033
I'm not imagining anything.
I heard him screaming.

23:37.068 --> 23:39.393
- Then their lights flickered.
- And he hasn't been seen since.

23:39.428 --> 23:41.230
Uh-huh, it's not exactly
a slam-dunk, is it?

23:41.265 --> 23:43.638
Well, it sure as hell is probable cause.

23:44.519 --> 23:47.403
It's only thunder. It's only thunder.
It can't hurt you.

23:47.438 --> 23:49.990
- What do you want me to do?
- Do your job. Call the sheriff.

23:50.025 --> 23:52.318
If I call the local yokels
they're gonna want to talk to Monk.

23:52.353 --> 23:54.100
I can't allow that.

23:54.135 --> 23:55.440
W-what kind of cop are you?

23:55.475 --> 23:57.652
I'm a cop who has
his priorities straight, Captain.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.497
It's my job to protect that man.

23:59.532 --> 24:01.453
What if he's wrong?
We'll be blowing his cover for nothing.

24:01.488 --> 24:03.142
He is never wrong.

24:03.177 --> 24:05.086
Maybe he heard something. I don't
know, a scream. Maybe the TV was on.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.633
Well, why did she lie to me
when I called her?

24:13.939 --> 24:15.886
You called her?

24:15.921 --> 24:18.877
Yes, I called her. It was a local call.
It can't be traced.

24:18.912 --> 24:20.534
Okay.

24:21.432 --> 24:23.350
First thing in the morning,

24:23.385 --> 24:25.982
I'm gonna go into town
and talk to the sheriff.

24:26.017 --> 24:28.277
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tomorrow's too late.

24:28.312 --> 24:30.147
She could be getting rid of
the evidence right now.

24:30.182 --> 24:32.613
That's the best I can do.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:32.648 --> 24:35.487
I'm gonna wash up
and go to bed.

24:41.178 --> 24:44.656
Monk, are you sure?

24:44.691 --> 24:46.381
I mean, are you really sure?

24:46.416 --> 24:48.874
And don't give me
any of that 95% crap.

24:48.909 --> 24:54.285
Captain, I am 100% sure
that she probably killed him.

24:55.273 --> 24:57.683
What does that mean?

24:59.972 --> 25:01.949
95%.

25:18.464 --> 25:21.151
Whoa-ho, hey, I need
some privacy here. - Okay.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.737
Take your time.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.894
Be careful out there!

26:30.862 --> 26:33.166
Which way, left or right? - Uh...

26:33.201 --> 26:36.731
Not you. - Um, left.
I think the lake is that way.

26:42.479 --> 26:45.422
Hey, guys, joke's over.
Come on!

26:45.457 --> 26:47.623
Okay, when we get there,
what's the plan?

26:47.658 --> 26:49.805
We knock on the door.
If Mr. Willowby answers,

26:49.840 --> 26:51.712
we owe everybody
a great big apology.

26:51.747 --> 26:54.689
He's not gonna be there.
I'm telling you, she killed him.

26:55.244 --> 26:56.856
Okay, can I say something?

26:56.891 --> 26:59.249
I'm freaking out back
here. - Why?

26:59.662 --> 27:02.542
Everywhere you go,
every time you turn around,

27:02.577 --> 27:04.817
somebody is killing somebody else.

27:04.852 --> 27:06.391
That's true. - What?

27:06.426 --> 27:09.146
Well, there was the time
you went on vacation

27:09.181 --> 27:11.286
- and then on the airplane...
- These things happen.

27:11.321 --> 27:12.955
Oh, and then that...
that stage play.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.961
- It happens.
- To you! Not to me,

27:15.996 --> 27:20.013
not to anybody else.
It follows you around.

27:20.048 --> 27:22.756
You're not just unlucky,
it's... it's something else.

27:22.791 --> 27:25.122
- Bad karma?
- You're like a magnet.

27:25.157 --> 27:28.587
Bad karma. - It's like you're
causing it somehow.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.203
You're the Prince of Darkness.

27:32.238 --> 27:33.891
No, no. He's not
the Prince of Darkness.

27:33.926 --> 27:35.634
I've seen him vacuum the ceiling.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.837
You wouldn't see the Prince of
Darkness vacuuming the ceiling.

27:37.872 --> 27:42.070
I can picture the Prince of Darkness
vacuuming the ceiling to trick us.

27:42.105 --> 27:45.150
- He's very tricky.
- Stop calling me the Prince of Darkness.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.051
That's how rumors get started.

27:50.723 --> 27:52.476
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?

27:52.511 --> 27:53.916
We're stuck!

27:56.944 --> 27:59.295
Maybe we can back out.

27:59.915 --> 28:01.488
I'm trying.

28:05.119 --> 28:06.983
Maybe we can go forward.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.870
We can't go forward,
we're stuck.

28:08.905 --> 28:14.308
Maybe we can back out.
Back. Back out.

28:16.373 --> 28:18.630
Back out.

28:19.350 --> 28:22.343
Ow.
We're stuck.

28:22.378 --> 28:24.725
Open the door!

28:29.362 --> 28:32.098
Oh!
God!

28:33.611 --> 28:35.896
I think the main road's
about two miles up ahead.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.804
I'll stay here with Mr. Monk,
and you go ahead and get help!

28:38.839 --> 28:40.028
No, I can't leave you.

28:40.063 --> 28:42.789
Technically, he is still
in protective custody.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.670
Well, maybe we should all go.

28:49.446 --> 28:51.152
Or we could just stay here.

28:53.541 --> 28:55.082
What's this?

28:55.117 --> 28:57.841
Oh, oh, it's your birthday cake.

29:00.666 --> 29:02.549
We were gonna surprise you.

29:11.769 --> 29:13.473
Ready?

29:15.014 --> 29:17.621
Happy birthday, Captain.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.565
Thank you very much, Natalie.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.893
This is probably the most depressing
birthday I've ever had.

29:27.928 --> 29:29.815
I've had worse.

29:34.248 --> 29:37.917
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes, I did.

29:37.952 --> 29:40.019
What was it?

29:45.795 --> 29:48.892
- Did it involve me?
- Yes, it did.

29:57.046 --> 29:58.814
Cake?

30:05.244 --> 30:07.086
I'm almost scared to open this.

30:07.121 --> 30:09.037
It's like a Twilight Zone episode.

30:09.072 --> 30:12.300
First I almost get run over,
and then a check from the IRS?

30:12.335 --> 30:15.427
- Do you believe me now?
- I don't know what to think.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.668
Look at me.
I'm afraid of a cookie.

30:24.752 --> 30:25.888
What does it say?

30:26.520 --> 30:29.550
"An old friend is in danger.
Only you can save him."

30:29.585 --> 30:33.227
- An old friend?
- Monk?

30:47.498 --> 30:50.324
The number you dialed is
not in service at this time.

30:54.485 --> 30:58.118
Listen, I, uh... I gotta go.
Uh, can you get yourself home okay?

30:58.153 --> 31:00.133
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you later.

31:00.168 --> 31:03.016
I promise. I love you.

31:24.907 --> 31:27.763
It worked.
He actually fell for it.

31:27.798 --> 31:28.943
Of course he did.

31:28.978 --> 31:31.246
Now he's gonna lead us
right to Monk.

31:31.281 --> 31:32.823
You visiting Tommy tonight?

31:34.160 --> 31:37.629
Tell him to relax. Adrian Monk
won't live to testify against him.

31:41.216 --> 31:45.205
- What do you think?
- I think that north is that way.

31:45.736 --> 31:48.816
Are we lost?
Just tell me.

31:48.851 --> 31:51.398
I... I... I... I have to know.
Are... are we lost?

31:51.433 --> 31:54.059
We're not lost.

31:54.094 --> 31:56.362
Oh, my God.
We're lost!

31:57.519 --> 32:02.567
- Hey, water!
- Oh, oh. Water. Water.

32:02.602 --> 32:05.246
What?
What are you doing?

32:05.281 --> 32:07.692
Hey, don't, don't!
No, no, don't drink that!

32:07.727 --> 32:10.310
You don't wanna do that.
You don't wanna drink that.

32:10.795 --> 32:12.785
- Oh.
- Oh.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.780
Mr. Monk, you have to take a sip.
You're dehydrated.

32:14.815 --> 32:18.913
I'm not that thirsty.
I'm not drinkin' that.

32:18.948 --> 32:21.697
You have no idea what's in there.

32:21.732 --> 32:24.048
Monk, don't you know what this is?

32:24.083 --> 32:26.334
This is Sierra Springs!

32:26.369 --> 32:28.579
This is the water you drink all the time.

32:30.803 --> 32:34.098
Yeah, he's right.
And I saw it on the map.

32:34.133 --> 32:38.982
Which means the bottling plant
is right over that hill.

32:43.950 --> 32:46.432
- Sierra Springs?
- The one and only.

32:46.467 --> 32:47.936
This is where they get it.

32:47.971 --> 32:50.275
This is the exact same water,

32:50.310 --> 32:53.277
only it's free!

33:20.741 --> 33:22.561
Oh, uh...

33:49.998 --> 33:53.229
It is!
It's Sierra Springs!

33:55.109 --> 33:57.186
And it's free.

34:22.539 --> 34:23.944
Son of a bitch!

34:33.672 --> 34:36.981
Ah, ah, I got nature...

34:37.016 --> 34:39.722
There's... There's nature
on my hand. I need a wipe.

34:41.597 --> 34:43.101
Wipe!

34:45.003 --> 34:47.867
No, y-you can't clean
nature with nature!

34:47.902 --> 34:50.869
Shh! Listen.

34:53.641 --> 34:56.583
- It's a car!
- A car!

34:58.350 --> 35:00.477
It's probably people.

35:00.512 --> 35:02.148
Yeah, Monk,
it's probably people.

35:11.679 --> 35:12.920
I'm gonna take a few more pictures.

35:12.955 --> 35:14.310
I'll meet you guys
back at the station.

35:15.997 --> 35:18.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can I help you folks?

35:18.276 --> 35:20.054
Our car broke down.
We got a little lost.

35:20.089 --> 35:23.469
Yeah, we got a little lost in the woods.
We got a little lost.

35:23.504 --> 35:26.687
What happened here? - The guy
who lived here got hit by lightning.

35:26.722 --> 35:28.232
Guess when your number's up,
your number's up.

35:28.267 --> 35:29.275
What's your name, son?

35:29.310 --> 35:32.123
Coby. Paul Coby.
Deputy Paul Coby.

35:32.158 --> 35:34.805
Deputy Coby, I'm a homicide
detective from San Francisco.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.639
We're staying in a cabin
across the lake.

35:36.674 --> 35:40.531
- Oh, the FBI cabin.
- Yeah.

35:41.149 --> 35:42.081
Uh... uh... uh...

35:42.116 --> 35:44.995
Yeah, we've been watching the woman
that lives here, a Mrs. Willowby.

35:45.030 --> 35:46.623
That's right. Kathy Willowby.

35:46.658 --> 35:51.264
They wanna ask her a few questions.
It'll take just a minute.

35:51.299 --> 35:52.793
Captain?

35:54.181 --> 35:55.888
Hello?

36:03.598 --> 36:05.060
Hello?

36:06.609 --> 36:09.854
Excuse me. He, uh,
he was killed in this boat?

36:09.889 --> 36:12.356
That's right. I don't know
what he was doing out in the storm.

36:12.391 --> 36:14.362
He must be pretty serious
about his fishing.

36:14.397 --> 36:16.276
Got an uncle like that.

36:16.311 --> 36:19.602
That's where the lightning
hit. - Uh-huh.

36:21.561 --> 36:24.290
This rod is metal.

36:24.325 --> 36:28.071
Why didn't the lightning
hit the fishing rod first?

36:29.122 --> 36:30.420
I don't know.

36:30.455 --> 36:35.252
Here's the thing. I heard him
screaming for help two nights ago.

36:35.287 --> 36:36.547
That doesn't make sense.

36:36.582 --> 36:38.005
The medical examiner was just here.

36:38.040 --> 36:41.417
He put the time of death
at midnight last night.

36:41.452 --> 36:43.402
Is Mrs. Willowby here?

37:09.495 --> 37:12.932
Have a little respect here.
My husband died last night.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.462
I don't think so.

37:14.497 --> 37:18.087
I think he died the night before.
I heard him screaming.

37:18.122 --> 37:21.637
- You heard him.
- They're stayin' at the FBI cabin.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.456
Would you please stop calling it that?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.485
Well, talk to Dr. Culver.
He was just here.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.608
He can tell you that Martin died
last night on the lake.

37:30.756 --> 37:32.926
I told him not to go out in the rain.

37:33.677 --> 37:35.352
The old fool.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.299
Isn't that Martin's lucky fishing hat?

37:37.334 --> 37:39.508
- Why wasn't he wearing it?
- I don't know.

37:39.543 --> 37:41.489
Maybe he didn't want to get it wet.

37:47.245 --> 37:51.508
He seemed pretty excited
about his new lures.

37:51.543 --> 37:53.176
I was there when he bought them.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.585
Wonder why he didn't try them out.

37:55.620 --> 37:57.297
I don't have to talk to you,

37:58.720 --> 38:00.563
do I?

38:01.631 --> 38:05.673
I don't know, Kathy. I think he's asking
some mighty interesting questions.

38:05.708 --> 38:10.445
Mrs. Willowby, did Martin have
a life insurance policy? - Maybe.

38:10.480 --> 38:14.266
Did it have a double indemnity clause,
which pays double for an act of God?

38:14.301 --> 38:16.086
A lot of policies do.

38:16.785 --> 38:18.896
Look, I know my rights.

38:19.355 --> 38:22.440
If you people think you've got
something to prove, then prove it.

38:22.475 --> 38:24.762
Otherwise, I want you to go.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.458
- Lieutenant.
- Thank God.

38:29.493 --> 38:31.366
Randy, what are you doing here?

38:31.401 --> 38:33.970
Captain, I think Monk is in danger.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.923
I tried to call you, but...

38:36.417 --> 38:38.108
Okay, this sounds crazy,

38:38.143 --> 38:40.683
I've been getting these fortune cookies
and they've all been coming true.

38:40.718 --> 38:42.620
- Fortune cookies?
- Yeah. Today I got that one.

38:43.745 --> 38:46.628
- What, you got this today?
- Yeah, at lunch.

38:46.663 --> 38:48.520
Look, I don't believe
in any of this stuff,

38:48.555 --> 38:50.898
but that's the third one,
and they've all been coming true.

38:50.933 --> 38:53.406
Lieutenant, this was made by hand.

38:53.441 --> 38:56.669
You see the edge?
It was cut with a scissors.

38:58.079 --> 39:00.538
Randy, did you just drive up
here? - Yeah.

39:02.955 --> 39:04.389
Get down!

39:11.254 --> 39:12.794
Stay away from the window!

39:16.689 --> 39:18.966
- How many?
- There's at least two!

39:19.450 --> 39:22.090
- One behind the canoes...
- Where's the other one? - I don't know.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.763
- Who the hell are they?
- Hit men from San Francisco.

39:24.798 --> 39:27.119
- They're here to kill Monk!
- Good!

39:51.235 --> 39:54.622
Oh, my God. I've got it.
Here's what happened!

39:54.657 --> 39:57.024
- We didn't meet by accident.
- She electrocuted him.

39:57.059 --> 39:59.256
It was a set-up from the very beginning.

39:59.291 --> 40:02.614
Oh, I can see that now.
God, I'm such an idiot!

40:02.649 --> 40:05.405
She dropped the radio into the tub
while he was bathing.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.741
She wanted to make it look like an act
of God to collect the extra insurance...

40:08.776 --> 40:11.769
Maybe I believed it
because I wanted to believe it.

40:11.804 --> 40:14.573
All those fortunes were printed
in advance, just for me!

40:14.608 --> 40:17.146
She had to preserve the body
until the storm came.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.671
That's why she bought
those bags of ice.

40:18.706 --> 40:21.690
My head is spinning. Which one are
you listening to? - Neither one.

40:21.725 --> 40:27.433
She froze the body so the coroner
would never know the time of death.

40:27.468 --> 40:30.711
The first fortune predicted
that I'd be saved from a dirty death

40:30.746 --> 40:33.615
which is exactly what happened
when I left the restaurant.

40:33.650 --> 40:36.657
Last night, during the storm,
she put her husband in the boat,

40:36.692 --> 40:41.465
then cut it loose, waited a few hours,
and then reported it as an accident.

40:42.121 --> 40:43.784
Now I have to go back and arrest my

40:43.785 --> 40:46.112
girlfriend for conspiracy
and attempted murder.

40:46.147 --> 40:47.921
She'll probably break up with me.

40:54.042 --> 40:55.696
FBI! Freeze!

41:03.844 --> 41:05.112
Grooms!

41:15.154 --> 41:16.945
A little vacation, huh?

41:23.782 --> 41:27.257
- Is it over?
- Not for you.

41:27.292 --> 41:29.007
I'm gonna order a full autopsy
on Martin's body.

41:29.042 --> 41:31.763
They'll know if it was
lightning or electrocution.

41:35.262 --> 41:38.017
- So, what the hell happened here?
- She electrocuted her husband.

41:39.980 --> 41:43.175
Well, it looks like
we all had a pretty full day. - Huh?

41:43.210 --> 41:47.186
You guys solved a homicide, and I
led those two hit men into our trap.

41:47.722 --> 41:50.233
- Yeah, that was...
- Right, Randy. - Brilliant.

41:50.268 --> 41:52.023
Really good. - Thanks.

42:00.824 --> 42:03.148
- I get it now.
- Get what?

42:03.183 --> 42:04.715
It's not bad karma,

42:04.750 --> 42:07.505
people getting killed
whenever he's around.

42:07.540 --> 42:09.137
It's good karma,

42:09.172 --> 42:12.546
because he's there to catch 'em
and make it right.

42:12.581 --> 42:14.092
It's a good thing, isn't it?

42:14.127 --> 42:17.154
Yes, it is.
It's a good thing.

42:22.814 --> 42:25.651
Come on.
I'll buy you a wipe.
