WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:11.925
- Ring me if you ever...
- What?..want to ring me.

00:12.078 --> 00:15.597
Sarah Gordon at SIFA flagged up
issues with the building itself.

00:15.598 --> 00:19.077
We're speaking to the people
who refurbished it in 2008.

00:19.078 --> 00:20.757
MacAfee Construction.

00:20.758 --> 00:22.197
Well, the police just spoke to me

00:22.198 --> 00:25.157
to see if we're culpable of doing
things that maybe made a fire

00:25.158 --> 00:26.837
turn into a really bad fire.

00:26.838 --> 00:29.517
There is likely to be
a fatal accident enquiry.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.237
The families will want answers.

00:31.238 --> 00:33.277
I'd like to speak with
a guest staying with you.

00:33.278 --> 00:34.798
Pia Salvador.

00:37.358 --> 00:38.877
Have you shown this to anyone?

00:38.878 --> 00:39.788
What does it mean?

00:39.790 --> 00:42.517
That my mum and dad had
sex in your mum's bed.

00:42.518 --> 00:44.877
I was just wondering if you
asked your mum about the photo.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.798
No. I never saw her.

00:46.918 --> 00:48.437
I think you need to stop sleuthing.

00:48.438 --> 00:50.077
You don't know what
you're getting into.

00:50.078 --> 00:51.957
What, so you mean trust no-one?

00:51.958 --> 00:54.237
Will you keep an eye on Emma Hedges?

00:54.238 --> 00:55.078
Why?

00:55.080 --> 00:57.597
She knows something that
was never disclosed.

00:57.598 --> 01:00.037
- Hi, Dad.
- We need to talk about that photo.

01:00.038 --> 01:04.236
- Come over in the morning.
- Got myself into trouble.

01:04.238 --> 01:08.878
♪ Baby, you understand me now?

01:10.798 --> 01:14.958
♪ If sometimes you see that I'm mad

01:16.638 --> 01:22.638
♪ Don't you know that no-one
alive can always be an angel?

01:23.718 --> 01:27.838
♪ When everything goes wrong,
you see some bad

01:29.318 --> 01:35.318
♪ Oh, I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good

01:36.278 --> 01:42.278
♪ Oh, Lord, please, don't
let me be misunderstood. ♪

01:49.118 --> 01:51.557
I hope everything
goes OK with your dad.

01:51.558 --> 01:53.557
How long do you think
you'll be with him?

01:53.558 --> 01:56.077
The thing we need to talk
about could turn out to be big.

01:56.078 --> 01:59.597
Even the fact that it's come
out could be big, so...

01:59.598 --> 02:02.449
Sorry.
I will tell you at some point.

02:02.450 --> 02:04.359
That's fine.

02:04.518 --> 02:08.276
If you're free at lunchtime, maybe
we can meet for a poke of chips.

02:08.277 --> 02:09.862
You had me at poke.

02:23.558 --> 02:24.877
What are you like?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.877
Two all-nighters in a row.

02:26.878 --> 02:29.157
No, this wasn't anything like...

02:29.158 --> 02:32.598
I mean, that was...
Like, I was, uh...

02:32.758 --> 02:33.758
God knows.

02:35.318 --> 02:38.198
- But this guy...
- What's up?

02:38.318 --> 02:40.078
I'm in love.

02:40.198 --> 02:42.077
With a guy you just met?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.438
Yeah.

02:43.518 --> 02:45.437
Who you've known since...?

02:45.438 --> 02:46.878
Yesterday.

02:46.998 --> 02:48.078
Who is he?!

02:49.678 --> 02:51.598
His name's Daniel.

02:51.718 --> 02:53.877
I met him outside that club
when I went back for my bag,

02:53.878 --> 02:56.838
and... he's wonderful.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.238
0 to 60, aren't you?

02:59.318 --> 03:00.318
Right.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.197
Try not to get married before
I've finished my shift.

03:04.198 --> 03:05.438
OK.

03:05.558 --> 03:07.157
And don't give him your PIN number.

03:07.158 --> 03:09.078
OK!

03:09.158 --> 03:10.758
Skye?

03:10.878 --> 03:12.797
My dad rang me last night.

03:12.798 --> 03:15.077
He says we need to talk
about that photo.

03:15.078 --> 03:16.438
You're joking.

03:16.518 --> 03:18.837
How would he know I've seen it?

03:18.838 --> 03:20.198
Don't know.

03:20.318 --> 03:22.438
You didn't tell your mum?

03:22.518 --> 03:23.518
No.

03:25.398 --> 03:27.157
Do you think I'm a liar?

03:27.158 --> 03:29.038
No!

03:29.158 --> 03:30.158
Good.

03:35.638 --> 03:38.597
We have the Procurator Fiscal
with us today.

03:38.598 --> 03:40.077
Where would you like to start?

03:40.078 --> 03:42.037
Have you found any link at all

03:42.038 --> 03:44.317
between Shuggie Brook
murdering Ian Howie

03:44.318 --> 03:47.957
and the deaths of Shelley Nardoni
and Bashir Kumar?

03:47.958 --> 03:48.958
No.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.037
So two unfortunate innocents?

03:51.038 --> 03:53.877
It's looking like this was
the chain of events.

03:53.878 --> 03:57.677
Brook kills Howie to try
and get out of debt pressure.

03:57.678 --> 04:00.797
He locks the door to the office
to cover his actions.

04:00.798 --> 04:03.397
He doesn't know that
these two are in there.

04:03.398 --> 04:07.437
He realises he's accidentally killed
Bashir Kumar and his own niece.

04:07.438 --> 04:10.437
He kills himself by
jumping off the bridge.

04:10.438 --> 04:13.438
Sarah Gordon's report is due today.

04:13.598 --> 04:15.517
We'll go through it
with her this afternoon,

04:15.518 --> 04:18.677
get the full picture of what and who
contributed to the fire at Secrets.

04:18.678 --> 04:20.317
Not just Shuggie Brook -

04:20.317 --> 04:22.877
the building companies
are of interest to me -

04:22.878 --> 04:25.378
and see how we should proceed.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.238
Ah, boss, got five minutes?

04:32.318 --> 04:34.638
Aye, Neil. Come away in.

04:34.798 --> 04:37.477
Well, the photo of
the parents is interesting,

04:37.478 --> 04:39.598
but it's not substantive.

04:39.718 --> 04:44.678
Someone citing dismemberment
when it was never disclosed is,

04:44.798 --> 04:47.838
so I'd agree that needs followed up.

04:47.998 --> 04:51.558
I didn't push her at all,
to be fair.

04:51.678 --> 04:54.437
I could have another chat with her,
see what she says.

04:54.438 --> 04:57.318
Good. See where that takes you.

04:57.438 --> 04:58.798
OK. Will do.

05:00.318 --> 05:02.197
- What about Drew?
- Oh, aye.

05:02.198 --> 05:04.117
Ask him about his relationship
with his ex.

05:04.118 --> 05:06.035
Do whatever needs done.

05:06.118 --> 05:07.678
Initial enquiries.

05:07.798 --> 05:08.882
Thanks, boss.

05:10.798 --> 05:13.477
What's she like - the lassie Emma?

05:13.478 --> 05:15.978
She's got her head screwed on.

05:25.598 --> 05:28.718
Bobby's still at it. Good.

05:28.798 --> 05:31.632
Let me see what you've got for us.

05:40.918 --> 05:42.335
Got any data yet?

05:42.398 --> 05:44.077
We're still reviewing
the chromatograms

05:44.078 --> 05:45.997
from last night's run
of police samples.

05:45.998 --> 05:48.797
We're making nice progress.
I think we're a good team.

05:48.798 --> 05:51.677
Let's have a check-in meeting
in a couple of days, OK?

05:51.678 --> 05:52.997
I'm not here this afternoon.

05:52.998 --> 05:58.082
I've got a meeting with the Fiscal
to discuss the fire report.

05:59.598 --> 06:02.597
The internal walls don't go to roof
height above the false ceiling

06:02.598 --> 06:05.037
so there's a void
which filled with smoke.

06:05.038 --> 06:07.357
So put that. Everyone can get that.

06:07.358 --> 06:09.158
OK, good.

06:09.318 --> 06:14.077
I told Neil you were dying to know
who the anthro was on Marie Monroe.

06:14.078 --> 06:16.495
- His lips were zipped.
- Ugh.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.357
She went missing in August.

06:20.358 --> 06:21.837
She was dug up in November.

06:21.838 --> 06:24.357
That's up to three months
in the ground

06:24.358 --> 06:26.837
exposed to fauna, warmish soil.

06:26.838 --> 06:30.957
- I just wonder what they had to work with.
- How decomposed you mean? - Yeah.

06:30.958 --> 06:31.958
How's Emma?

06:33.398 --> 06:34.718
She seems OK.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.038
Hiya.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.158
Hey.

06:58.598 --> 07:01.457
I'm guessing you found it
when you stayed over here.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.837
Yeah.

07:02.838 --> 07:05.157
I mean, I don't know why
you were going through my things,

07:05.158 --> 07:08.277
but, given that you did,
and you found it,

07:08.278 --> 07:10.597
I can see why it might
get you thinking.

07:10.598 --> 07:14.317
What I don't get at all is why you
didn't just ask me about it.

07:14.318 --> 07:15.957
Well, you weren't here.

07:15.958 --> 07:19.208
- I have a phone.
- You don't answer it.

07:19.718 --> 07:24.118
You don't! You disappear.
You're inconsistent.

07:24.238 --> 07:27.118
- Talk to me properly.
- OK.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.757
I went through your things,

07:28.758 --> 07:30.677
and the reason that I did
was cos you left me here

07:30.678 --> 07:32.157
in the middle of the night.

07:32.158 --> 07:34.317
There was some guy banging
at the door at 3am,

07:34.318 --> 07:36.157
wanting to come in
and collect something,

07:36.158 --> 07:37.517
saying he was expected,

07:37.518 --> 07:40.517
and I thought, "Shit, he must
be buying drugs off my dad."

07:40.518 --> 07:42.157
I thought the flat
must be full of drugs.

07:42.158 --> 07:44.597
"Shit, what if they're in
this case under the bed?"

07:44.598 --> 07:48.957
And I was panicking and freaking
out because it was 3am, and...

07:48.958 --> 07:51.517
...I'd got no idea
where you'd gone.

07:51.518 --> 07:54.237
If you hadn't have left me,
I wouldn't have found the photo,

07:54.238 --> 07:55.957
but I left you two voice mails.

07:55.958 --> 07:58.677
I'm sorry. I don't always
listen to my voice mails.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.117
You're better off texting me.

08:00.118 --> 08:02.597
And I'm sorry that you were scared.

08:02.598 --> 08:04.637
- I didn't want to wake you.
- Where did you go?

08:04.638 --> 08:06.797
Over to see my girlfriend Shauna.

08:06.798 --> 08:08.877
She was feeling a bit jealous.

08:08.878 --> 08:10.797
Who was the guy at the door?

08:10.798 --> 08:14.597
Could have been my pal Tam. He
never makes sense after midnight.

08:14.598 --> 08:15.678
All right.

08:15.798 --> 08:18.398
Let's talk about this, OK?

08:18.518 --> 08:21.438
No bullshit. Adult to adult.

08:21.638 --> 08:24.877
This photograph is exactly
what it looks like.

08:24.878 --> 08:27.357
It's me and your mum
in bed together.

08:27.358 --> 08:31.077
Izzy's bed in Izzy's place in -
you can just make it out -

08:31.078 --> 08:32.078
May 2000.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.398
Izzy took it.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.116
Now, clearly your mum and I
have just slept together.

08:40.118 --> 08:43.236
We did sleep together from
time to time over the years

08:43.238 --> 08:48.238
because we had never really
completely stopped... wanting to.

08:49.758 --> 08:51.358
Did Jimmy know?

08:51.438 --> 08:53.318
No.

08:53.478 --> 08:55.197
I genuinely don't think so,

08:55.198 --> 08:58.197
and, like I say,
it was very occasional.

08:58.198 --> 09:00.037
I was away for long stretches,

09:00.038 --> 09:02.037
and it was always in the day,
or just after school.

09:02.038 --> 09:03.157
And where was I?

09:03.158 --> 09:05.477
Well, Izzy would take you
and Skye off somewhere.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.717
Marie would return the favour

09:06.718 --> 09:10.237
if Izzy ever wanted
to hook up with someone.

09:10.238 --> 09:12.072
Did you want Mum back?

09:12.438 --> 09:14.278
No.

09:14.358 --> 09:16.518
Did she want you back?

09:16.638 --> 09:18.597
She had more sense than that.

09:18.598 --> 09:20.278
So what was it?

09:20.438 --> 09:24.158
A known connection.
Fun. Naughty.

09:24.318 --> 09:26.597
That was the year before she died.

09:26.598 --> 09:28.515
I'm very aware of that.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.677
I can see where your mind's going,
and mine would go there, too,

09:33.678 --> 09:35.717
but I was back in
the rig the day before

09:35.718 --> 09:37.477
your mother was last seen alive,

09:37.478 --> 09:39.797
and I stayed in the rig
for two weeks.

09:39.798 --> 09:41.957
Now, Emma, darling, sorry,
Shauna made that candle.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.517
- Well, it's horrible.
- Hey.

09:43.518 --> 09:46.197
- Well, it is.
- You're being a brat.

09:46.198 --> 09:48.157
Who told you I'd seen it - Izzy?

09:48.158 --> 09:50.957
- It's not relevant.
- It is to me.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.757
What you and my mum got up to
is relevant to me, and...

09:53.758 --> 09:56.517
What we did was between two adults
and didn't affect anyone else...

09:56.518 --> 09:58.597
- ...every couple of years...
- Will you let me finish?

09:58.598 --> 10:02.597
- ...but I lost my mum!
- Shut up! Shut up a minute!

10:02.598 --> 10:04.797
When your mum went missing,

10:04.798 --> 10:06.877
when she was found, it was hellish.

10:06.878 --> 10:09.957
All of us suffered. I don't
want folk to suffer more now.

10:09.958 --> 10:12.557
Now, I'm asking you to drop this.

10:12.558 --> 10:14.237
There's nothing to see here.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.758
Nothing to gain.

10:16.878 --> 10:19.958
And, please, don't tell Jimmy.

10:21.678 --> 10:24.158
I haven't told Jimmy,

10:24.278 --> 10:26.528
but I have told the police.

10:33.878 --> 10:36.795
I think you'll come to regret that.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.060
- All right?
- Hi.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.920
Come on. Let's go.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.219
You ever been mackerel fishing?

11:59.220 --> 12:00.700
No.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.779
You can go out on a boat
just up the road from here.

12:03.780 --> 12:05.579
Fancy trying it sometime?

12:05.580 --> 12:06.580
Definitely.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.700
I love you.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Well, you said it first.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.859
- What?
- Almost the first thing you said to me.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.539
I gave you your bag back,
and you said, "I love you."

12:21.540 --> 12:23.779
Well, "I love you" means thank you.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.114
Not in Scotland.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.024
Well, I... I do love you.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.340
Need to get this, sorry.

12:39.420 --> 12:42.859
- You all right?
- Hiya, son. How the fuck are you?

12:42.860 --> 12:45.540
- I'm OK.
- Can you talk? Sure.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.139
Patrick can do four o'clock today.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.979
He'll take us through whatever shite
they'll be trying to throw at you

12:50.980 --> 12:52.510
with regard to the fire at Secrets.

12:52.511 --> 12:53.019
OK.

12:53.020 --> 12:56.059
This is what it means to run
a company, son. It's tough,

12:56.060 --> 12:59.139
- and you're learning the hard way.
- Yeah. It'll be the making of you.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.739
- You'll get through it. I know you will.
- Thanks, Dad.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.859
How about dinner this week on me?

13:03.860 --> 13:06.259
Well, if I do, could I
maybe bring someone?

13:06.260 --> 13:09.094
Of course you can. Take care, son.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.939
When was it built - Secrets?

13:12.940 --> 13:14.739
We didn't build Secrets.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.060
We did it up in 2008.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.352
Well, you weren't the director
then, surely?

13:19.353 --> 13:21.340
I wasn't. My dad was.

13:22.780 --> 13:26.299
So why is it you that
the solicitor needs to see?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.800
I was the foreman.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.990
I was the foreman,
and people have died.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.140
- Boss.
- Thank you, Trina.

13:57.340 --> 14:00.619
You know someone's waiting on you
at the front desk, don't you?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.260
- No.
- Drew Cubbin.

14:20.579 --> 14:22.779
- You're fine, you're fine...
- Sorry.

14:22.780 --> 14:26.859
- Professor Gordon hasn't been in.
- Thank you. No problem.

14:26.860 --> 14:30.939
Let me do the cleaning up by myself
tonight. You finish early.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.340
OK. Thanks.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.659
You know that fire scene
Prof Gordon was working on?

14:39.660 --> 14:41.577
- Was it a club?
- Yeah.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.620
Was it called Secrets?

14:43.740 --> 14:46.574
Yeah. It's been all over the news.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.290
The reason I came in.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.074
Thought you might like this.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.740
It's all yours.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.099
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.350
Seems to have caused
some consternation.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.380
Can we talk? Man to man.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.580
Well, I am and you are,
so on you go.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.260
The thing about Marie,

15:18.420 --> 15:21.587
it wasn't easy for her
to reach orgasm.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.939
- OK.
- There was a trick to it.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.139
Not a trick. Trick's the wrong word.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.032
You had to know what you were doing.

15:29.033 --> 15:30.235
- OK.
- Are you with me?

15:30.236 --> 15:32.172
Yeah,
you knew what you were doing.

15:32.173 --> 15:34.938
Her and me... it worked.

15:34.940 --> 15:38.339
You know? Now, I'm not saying
that that's all there was to it.

15:38.340 --> 15:40.899
You know, we were fond of
one another right enough,

15:40.900 --> 15:45.899
but she was married to Jimmy Levin
for six years and didn't come once.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.619
She was never going to leave him.
I liked my freedom.

15:48.620 --> 15:52.659
It was a mutually satisfactory,
occasional, physical thing.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.827
- Two coffees.
- Thank you.

15:57.820 --> 15:58.820
Thanks.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.939
Why was she never
going to leave him?

16:03.940 --> 16:06.139
Because she knew he'd support her.

16:06.140 --> 16:08.059
She had an aversion
to him physically,

16:08.060 --> 16:11.227
but he loved her
and gave her security.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.579
Did Marie have other lovers
aside from you?

16:15.580 --> 16:17.300
No.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.780
You sound sure.

16:18.940 --> 16:22.940
Well, I don't see when
she would have managed it.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.659
And I think she would have told me.

16:24.660 --> 16:27.994
I mean, it would have
been OK for her to.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.980
What about Izzy Alessi?

16:32.060 --> 16:33.310
What about her?

16:34.620 --> 16:38.300
Quite an intimate moment
she photographed -

16:38.460 --> 16:40.380
you and Marie in bed.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.334
Was Izzy physically intimate
with you or Marie?

16:44.940 --> 16:46.060
No, no.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.859
Now we're entering
the realms of fantasy.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.260
No.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.259
You know, I had one or two nights
with Izzy when we were at school.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.459
Pished. We were
just pals after that.

16:55.460 --> 16:59.739
Yeah, I love her to bits,
but she's too fruit-loops for me.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.299
We were always easy, the three
of us. Uninhibited.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.979
It was no big deal for Izzy
to take that photo.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.146
It was just fun, you know?

17:07.220 --> 17:09.099
You know what it was?

17:09.260 --> 17:12.979
Because we all knew
each other from so young...

17:12.980 --> 17:13.980
Phew.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.220
When we got together,

17:19.380 --> 17:22.699
however many years had passed,
whatever else was going on,

17:22.700 --> 17:25.284
we just reverted to that state.

17:26.819 --> 17:31.339
I know we spoke to you in 2001.
I know you were alibied.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.259
You didn't tell us at the time

17:33.260 --> 17:35.619
that you and Marie
continued to be lovers.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.620
Why?

17:38.300 --> 17:41.339
Because it had nothing
to do with her murder.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.924
As far as you know.

17:43.060 --> 17:46.227
Well, Jimmy Levin
didn't do it, did he?

17:47.860 --> 17:48.860
Because?

17:50.220 --> 17:53.054
Because he doesn't have the balls.

17:54.660 --> 17:56.059
Emma's impetuous.

17:56.060 --> 17:59.579
You know, she loves her drama.
Very smart cookie, mind you.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.939
First-class degree in chemistry.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.020
Impressive.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.030
Would you mind?

18:19.220 --> 18:20.220
Thank you.

18:21.660 --> 18:26.819
I take it you'd be OK for us to get
this down in statement form?

18:26.820 --> 18:27.820
OK.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.724
And take a DNA sample from you?

18:34.140 --> 18:35.140
Oh, aye.

18:42.429 --> 18:47.228
Give me a minute to set up.
I'll have the MOOC questions ready.

18:47.229 --> 18:50.309
Hey, I hope you don't
mind me asking,

18:50.469 --> 18:55.469
but was your friend Pia
yesterday by any chance

18:55.629 --> 18:57.589
the postcard sender?

19:00.749 --> 19:04.229
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:09.669 --> 19:11.349
- Neil, hi.
- Kathy...

19:11.350 --> 19:14.327
I've been looking through
the Marie Munroe reports,

19:14.328 --> 19:17.548
and I'd like your professional
opinion on something.

19:17.549 --> 19:19.349
- Sure.
- Fantastic.

19:19.469 --> 19:22.229
Well, will I send the stuff over,

19:22.429 --> 19:26.028
and, well, we can chat through
it whenever it suits you?

19:26.029 --> 19:29.113
- Perfect.
- See you later. Bye, Neil.

19:29.229 --> 19:30.229
Take care.

19:34.629 --> 19:37.308
I'm sorry I was a bitch just then.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.828
Pia is the postcard sender,

19:38.829 --> 19:40.908
and I totally blew it so
I can't talk about it, OK?

19:40.909 --> 19:42.826
I'm ready when you are.

19:45.349 --> 19:47.308
Shelley Nardoni's mother is furious

19:47.309 --> 19:49.748
that Secrets nightclub owner
Shuggie Brook killed himself

19:49.749 --> 19:52.228
and can't be held to account
for the death of her daughter.

19:52.229 --> 19:54.748
The Kumars are shoulder to shoulder
with the Nardonis

19:54.749 --> 19:56.828
- in wanting to see justice done...
- Of course.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.868
...but they've hit a wall.

19:58.869 --> 20:02.428
- They want to sue for these deaths.
- Loss to society. Exactly.

20:02.429 --> 20:03.668
But who are they going to sue?

20:03.669 --> 20:05.828
They can't sue Brook - he's dead.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.948
His insurance won't pay out
because he started the fire.

20:08.949 --> 20:12.388
His estate is worth nothing
because of his debts.

20:12.389 --> 20:15.908
So the focus of blame is shifting
to the building company

20:15.909 --> 20:20.076
- that refurbished Secrets.
- MacAfee Construction.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.589
Patrick, this is my son Daniel,

20:24.669 --> 20:26.948
director of MacAfee Construction.

20:26.949 --> 20:28.708
- Good to meet you, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.508
I'm a wee bit pressured time-wise.
Are we OK to get stuck in?

20:31.509 --> 20:34.708
Look, I want justice done
for the families, too,

20:34.709 --> 20:36.668
but my starting point has to be

20:36.669 --> 20:40.188
is there a sufficiency of evidence
to raise a criminal charge?

20:40.189 --> 20:43.389
Now, let's go over Sarah's report.

20:43.469 --> 20:45.108
Well, the doors were sub-standard.

20:45.109 --> 20:48.548
They didn't comply with FD30,
let alone FD60.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.108
They wouldn't even have given
half an hour protection.

20:51.109 --> 20:54.948
Another thing is you used
polystyrene tiles on the ceilings.

20:54.949 --> 20:58.468
Polystyrene tiles melt and drip fire
onto the area below them,

20:58.469 --> 21:00.108
and, due to bad house-keeping,

21:00.109 --> 21:02.108
there was plenty of fuel
for them to drip onto.

21:02.109 --> 21:03.908
You mentioned fuel loading
in the office.

21:03.909 --> 21:06.668
- Boxes of crisps.
- A really good fuel source.

21:06.669 --> 21:08.828
There was a pack of kitchen roll
by the toaster,

21:08.829 --> 21:11.829
so the fire started in the toaster

21:11.989 --> 21:14.388
then most likely developed
in the kitchen roll,

21:14.389 --> 21:16.228
extended up to ceiling height,

21:16.229 --> 21:18.109
melting ceiling tiles,

21:18.269 --> 21:21.788
breaching into the ceiling cavity
then melted more tiles,

21:21.789 --> 21:24.948
which dripped fire onto the
boxes of crisps in the office,

21:24.949 --> 21:27.388
igniting them and creating
a second seat of fire.

21:27.389 --> 21:30.348
Any suggestion the fuel loading
was intentional on Brook's part?

21:30.349 --> 21:32.868
No. The barman says it's
been like that for years.

21:32.869 --> 21:37.188
We need to remember that Shelley
and Bashir were locked in that room.

21:37.189 --> 21:41.388
Yes, but the void above the false
ceilings didn't go to roof height,

21:41.389 --> 21:45.108
suggesting that was a major factor
in the spread of the fire.

21:45.109 --> 21:46.359
This is a joke.

21:47.589 --> 21:52.308
The major factor is Shuggie Brook
set fire to his own property.

21:52.309 --> 21:56.588
Daniel MacAfee is the statutory
director of MacAfee Construction,

21:56.589 --> 21:59.588
but Phil MacAfee was the director
at the point of investigation

21:59.589 --> 22:03.748
when this refurbishment was done,
and his son was the foreman.

22:03.749 --> 22:05.868
Phil MacAfee runs
a separate business now.

22:05.869 --> 22:07.788
What's my boy looking at?

22:07.789 --> 22:09.948
We'll know more after
the big meeting they're having,

22:09.949 --> 22:11.116
but I think...

22:11.269 --> 22:13.068
We're looking at
MacAfee Construction,

22:13.069 --> 22:16.428
prosecuting the company
for corporate homicide.

22:16.429 --> 22:17.829
Jesus Christ.

22:17.949 --> 22:20.616
Not you personally. The company.

22:20.749 --> 22:23.428
They'll be looking to fine
MacAfee Construction.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.763
- Well, how much?
- A substantial amount.

22:30.389 --> 22:33.639
No. Corporate homicide.
It's not enough.

22:34.989 --> 22:38.308
Builders, right?
Anybody can be a builder.

22:38.309 --> 22:40.388
There's no entry qualification.

22:40.389 --> 22:44.428
Anybody can be a builder, which is
why some of them are so bad.

22:44.429 --> 22:47.588
It is in the public interest to
prosecute these kinds of breaches.

22:47.589 --> 22:49.629
I've read your reports.

22:49.749 --> 22:53.916
The Health and Safety Executive
report was damning.

22:53.949 --> 22:55.189
No.

22:55.349 --> 22:58.748
These individuals,
Phil and Daniel MacAfee,

22:58.749 --> 23:01.668
these individuals acted
with blatant disregard

23:01.669 --> 23:03.028
for the safety of the public,

23:03.029 --> 23:05.148
and what goes on the indictment
should reflect that.

23:05.149 --> 23:06.649
Culpable homicide.

23:08.109 --> 23:10.526
I'm going after the MacAfees.

23:12.564 --> 23:14.524
There was no anthro.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.484
What?

23:15.486 --> 23:19.628
Marie Monroe's remains were
examined by a pathologist.

23:19.629 --> 23:21.908
- What?!
- A trainee pathologist.

23:21.909 --> 23:24.428
How can you not use an anthro
when you have dismembered remains

23:24.429 --> 23:25.868
dumped in the ground for months?

23:25.869 --> 23:27.588
Some of the bones were
never recovered.

23:27.589 --> 23:30.828
Can you imagine what
they might have missed?!

23:30.829 --> 23:35.579
- Where are you going?
- One of my PhD students is broken.

23:36.389 --> 23:40.556
Why don't you put them
down here? Down here.

23:45.349 --> 23:47.308
Hi, Daniel, it's Patrick here.

23:47.309 --> 23:49.908
Listen, pal. The Fiscal's
going to play hardball.

23:49.909 --> 23:52.868
He's got a warrant for your arrest
for culpable homicide,

23:52.869 --> 23:55.748
but he won't pass it to the police
if you surrender at court tomorrow.

23:55.749 --> 24:00.166
Give me a ring. I'll talk you
through it. OK? Bye-bye.

24:07.349 --> 24:09.683
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

24:10.389 --> 24:11.389
Awful.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.789
Do you want to meet up?

24:14.869 --> 24:17.269
No. No, thanks.

24:17.429 --> 24:21.429
- I'm just going to go home.
- OK. Call me later.

24:26.029 --> 24:29.029
Marie was buried in a closed coffin.

24:30.389 --> 24:33.223
We knew her remains were skeletal.

24:34.869 --> 24:37.748
I remember being advised
not to see them,

24:37.749 --> 24:39.666
and I had no desire to.

24:40.509 --> 24:43.988
They'd identified Marie
with dental records.

24:43.989 --> 24:47.406
Nobody ever mentioned
dismemberment to me.

24:48.429 --> 24:49.679
Until Emma did.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.628
Until Izzy Alessi put
the idea in Emma's head,

24:52.629 --> 24:54.379
and Emma ran with it.

24:56.309 --> 24:58.508
- Are you in contact with Izzy?
- No, no, no.

24:58.509 --> 25:03.308
I'd sometimes see her when Marie
was alive, but barely at all since.

25:03.309 --> 25:07.348
The last time I saw her,
she was in a shocking condition.

25:07.349 --> 25:08.548
And when was that?

25:08.549 --> 25:11.299
Oh, years ago in the town centre.

25:11.869 --> 25:14.536
She looked like a street junkie.

25:15.429 --> 25:17.998
And she wasn't like that
when Marie was alive?

25:17.999 --> 25:19.514
No.

25:19.709 --> 25:22.149
She hit rock bottom after.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.146
Was Marie a good influence on Izzy?

25:26.149 --> 25:28.988
That's an interesting
way of coming at it.

25:28.989 --> 25:33.156
I always thought Izzy was
a bad influence on Marie.

25:40.469 --> 25:45.219
How was the physical side of
things between you and Marie?

25:48.949 --> 25:49.949
Fine.

25:52.149 --> 25:55.868
Drew tells us he and Marie
slept together occasionally

25:55.869 --> 25:57.828
after she was married to you.

25:57.829 --> 25:59.429
No. No.

26:01.509 --> 26:02.509
He's lying.

26:07.309 --> 26:10.629
We have a photo,
uh, to support it.

26:18.109 --> 26:19.609
You weren't aware?

26:21.749 --> 26:22.749
No.

26:30.669 --> 26:34.069
Hello. Julie?

26:34.189 --> 26:35.829
Anyone there?

26:35.989 --> 26:38.188
- What the hell are you up to?
- What are you talking about?

26:38.189 --> 26:40.109
The arrogance of you!

26:40.229 --> 26:44.548
Never... never thinking how
anyone else might be affected,

26:44.549 --> 26:47.068
how anyone else might... might
need to know

26:47.069 --> 26:49.068
that you're taking yourself
off to the police.

26:49.069 --> 26:54.028
No warning to anybody that
you've dragged this whole thing up,

26:54.029 --> 26:57.108
and we've had to have our noses
shoved in it again!

26:57.109 --> 26:58.988
I've just had Jimmy on the phone.

26:58.989 --> 27:01.108
He's just been told that
Marie was cheating on him!

27:01.109 --> 27:04.148
I've just had a Detective fucking
Inspector McKinven on the phone,

27:04.149 --> 27:07.388
saying that he's coming to my home
tomorrow to talk to me.

27:07.389 --> 27:10.149
You... We're real people

27:10.309 --> 27:13.748
with real feelings and you've
just treated us like SHIT!

27:13.749 --> 27:16.148
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, you have to think.

27:16.149 --> 27:17.788
Well, I've said that I'm sorry.

27:17.789 --> 27:19.708
It's too late for sorry.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.308
Well, then, you know what?
I'm not sorry.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.828
If no-one's got anything
to hide, fine.

27:24.829 --> 27:27.148
Let the police ask anything
they want, no harm done,

27:27.149 --> 27:28.748
but if someone is hiding something,

27:28.749 --> 27:32.999
I don't care how close
they are to me - bring it on.

27:34.189 --> 27:35.948
Are you Philip MacAfee?

27:35.949 --> 27:37.309
Yes, I am.

27:37.429 --> 27:38.828
I represent Philip MacAfee.

27:38.829 --> 27:42.996
He makes no plea or declaration,
and he seeks bail.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.829
Bail is not opposed.

27:44.949 --> 27:47.283
Stand up, Mr MacAfee.

27:50.309 --> 27:52.893
- Are you Daniel MacAfee?
- Yes.

27:54.389 --> 27:56.028
I represent Daniel MacAfee.

27:56.029 --> 27:59.988
He makes no plea or declaration,
and he seeks bail.

27:59.989 --> 28:01.468
Bail is not opposed.

28:01.469 --> 28:03.803
Stand up, Mr MacAfee.

28:09.149 --> 28:11.589
- What was that?
- Oh, I know.

28:11.709 --> 28:14.268
- Quicker than a carwash.
- So what now?

28:14.269 --> 28:16.588
You both just made
your appearance on petition,

28:16.589 --> 28:19.108
so now they have to serve
the indictment within ten months

28:19.109 --> 28:20.988
and start the trial
by this time next year.

28:20.989 --> 28:22.156
What do we do?

28:22.229 --> 28:24.668
We roll up our sleeves
and get negotiating.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.828
Serious damage limitation.

28:26.829 --> 28:29.189
Talk sense into Fiscal
because he's being a bastard.

28:29.190 --> 28:29.868
Aye.

28:29.869 --> 28:32.188
Now, I know you're a tight team,

28:32.189 --> 28:34.028
but the fact of you being
director at the time

28:34.029 --> 28:36.908
and you being the foreman could
get very, very complicated,

28:36.909 --> 28:39.108
which means, regretfully,
I can't work for you both,

28:39.109 --> 28:43.859
so, Daniel, you'll need to get
independent representation.

28:44.269 --> 28:45.909
We better do it.

28:46.069 --> 28:48.388
And the standard advice
in this situation is

28:48.389 --> 28:50.148
that the two of you
don't discuss the case.

28:50.149 --> 28:51.668
What's the worst-case scenario?

28:51.669 --> 28:55.068
Well, it's culpable homicide, so the
worst-case scenario is, you know...

28:55.069 --> 28:56.069
Jail.

29:04.836 --> 29:08.916
I lost my temper
with Emma last night.

29:09.036 --> 29:11.035
She thinks that there's a magic key,

29:11.036 --> 29:13.555
and she'll find it
and get to the truth.

29:13.556 --> 29:14.556
It's naive.

29:15.876 --> 29:19.035
Marie was in a crowd
of thousands of people

29:19.036 --> 29:20.555
from all over the world,

29:20.556 --> 29:24.195
many of whom left Dundee
the next day by sea.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.916
She was drunk.

29:26.076 --> 29:28.515
She got into a row with Jimmy
because she was drunk.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.995
Anything could have
happened with anyone.

29:30.996 --> 29:36.413
It even occurred to me that she
might have chosen to lose herself.

29:36.596 --> 29:39.355
But then they found her body
and that was that.

29:39.356 --> 29:42.075
Why would she have
wanted to lose herself?

29:42.076 --> 29:44.635
She had structure with Jimmy
and two lovely kids,

29:44.636 --> 29:47.555
but I think she found it
a bit staid.

29:47.556 --> 29:48.640
I don't know.

29:50.036 --> 29:53.370
Emma and I will make it up.
We always do.

29:53.956 --> 29:55.995
How did she come to live with you?

29:55.996 --> 30:00.876
I... After Marie went missing,
I rushed up to Dundee.

30:00.996 --> 30:03.746
We were all crowded into Jimmy's.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.180
Me and my husband, Jimmy's Mum.

30:08.076 --> 30:10.326
I was pregnant at the time.

30:11.836 --> 30:15.995
And, uh, we came back to Manchester
after two weeks,

30:15.996 --> 30:18.756
but I'd visit as much as I could.

30:18.876 --> 30:21.043
And then, come November...

30:24.196 --> 30:27.436
...after they found Marie's body,

30:27.596 --> 30:32.675
it was decided that I would take
Emma back to Manchester for a bit

30:32.676 --> 30:34.555
to keep her out of the fray.

30:34.556 --> 30:36.916
We set up home.

30:37.036 --> 30:40.436
The two of us worked
well together, so...

30:40.556 --> 30:43.796
and then... she asked me
to adopt her.

30:46.036 --> 30:47.836
Just the two of you?

30:47.916 --> 30:51.756
Mm. I, uh, I lost the baby...

30:54.636 --> 30:56.515
...after Marie was found,

30:56.516 --> 31:00.266
and my marriage went up
the wazoo a bit later.

31:03.476 --> 31:04.726
Hell of a time.

31:07.676 --> 31:08.676
Indeed.

31:12.876 --> 31:15.440
Louise,
can I show you something?

31:15.441 --> 31:16.661
Sure.

31:17.476 --> 31:22.956
What it is is this unknown
here keeps cropping up.

31:23.116 --> 31:25.315
I know we've not identified
the molecule yet,

31:25.316 --> 31:27.983
but I keep seeing the same peak.

31:29.396 --> 31:32.896
Different drug sample,
same retention time.

31:33.916 --> 31:37.835
- It's tiny, I know.
- I'm impressed you saw that, actually.

31:37.836 --> 31:40.435
Let's keep an eye on it
as we keep collecting data.

31:40.436 --> 31:43.235
Might be something we need
to tell Professor Gordon about.

31:43.236 --> 31:44.236
Nice work.

31:45.996 --> 31:49.236
I get Emma wanted answers.

31:49.316 --> 31:50.756
She's young.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.036
But for me...

31:56.876 --> 31:58.755
...to get by, I had to...

31:58.756 --> 32:00.436
I've had to let go.

32:02.116 --> 32:05.835
If there were answers out there,
we would have found them by now.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.995
It couldn't have been Jimmy.

32:07.996 --> 32:12.876
I mean, I know... Marie
and Jimmy had argued,

32:12.996 --> 32:15.195
but Jimmy wouldn't hurt a fly.

32:15.196 --> 32:16.780
He was all bluster.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.515
And it couldn't have been Drew.

32:19.516 --> 32:21.995
He was out on a rig
in the North Sea.

32:21.996 --> 32:25.795
Did you know Drew and Marie
continued to sleep together?

32:25.796 --> 32:27.756
Not till yesterday.

32:27.916 --> 32:32.083
Uh, Jimmy rang and told me
as soon as you told him.

32:32.236 --> 32:35.115
Hm. What did you think
when you heard?

32:35.116 --> 32:36.835
That Drew's a greedy wee bastard

32:36.836 --> 32:40.475
who wouldn't let her out of his
clutches, even after he left her.

32:40.476 --> 32:41.835
Why did he leave her?

32:41.836 --> 32:46.753
Oh, well, it was all a bit
too real life for him, wasn't it?

32:47.476 --> 32:50.516
Broken sleep, teething, nappies.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.275
It's all a bit much to deal with

32:52.276 --> 32:55.275
when you prefer sitting
around getting stoned.

32:55.276 --> 32:57.193
- You're not keen.
- Hm.

32:57.196 --> 32:58.196
I hate him.

33:00.116 --> 33:03.755
He's the worst kind of bastard
cos he's weak.

33:03.756 --> 33:06.875
I heard a rumour that he took
drugs onto the rigs,

33:06.876 --> 33:09.543
and I can see him doing it, too.

33:09.636 --> 33:12.195
Easy money, and it would
appeal to his vanity.

33:12.196 --> 33:15.363
You know, being the guy
with the goods.

33:15.716 --> 33:20.133
I never linked it cos I never
knew they stayed lovers.

33:22.236 --> 33:25.555
But if Drew was mixing
with dodgy people,

33:25.556 --> 33:28.115
and Marie was still seeing Drew,

33:28.116 --> 33:31.116
maybe she was mixing with them, too.

33:31.556 --> 33:33.475
We need to go back to Drew.

33:33.476 --> 33:36.195
We need the employment records
for when he worked on the rigs.

33:36.196 --> 33:37.835
And I want to talk to Jimmy again

33:37.836 --> 33:40.920
about that argument
he had with Marie.

33:44.836 --> 33:48.036
- Nope.
- Right, let's go.

33:49.316 --> 33:50.635
I mean, if it had been me,

33:50.636 --> 33:53.035
the first thing I would have done
is follow animal tracks,

33:53.036 --> 33:55.835
try to excavate fox dens and badger
sets for the missing bones,

33:55.836 --> 33:57.075
but nobody did that!

33:57.076 --> 33:59.315
Where are Marie Monroe's
missing bones?

33:59.316 --> 34:01.233
Still in the dump site?

34:01.276 --> 34:02.443
You know what?

34:02.516 --> 34:05.515
What Neil sent me to look over
so far is so depressingly bad,

34:05.516 --> 34:08.034
- I could even believe that.
- I've got first years in two minutes.

34:08.036 --> 34:10.620
Relax. I'm very important, too.

34:11.556 --> 34:13.755
Mm. I put fresh ginger in.

34:13.916 --> 34:17.594
- Yummy. I got you the salmon.
- Lovely, thank you.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.835
Saw your friend in there.

34:19.956 --> 34:20.956
Pia.

34:45.476 --> 34:47.476
Black Americano, please.

34:55.835 --> 34:56.835
What's up?

34:58.476 --> 35:01.556
I am looking for you.

35:01.676 --> 35:02.916
Oh.

35:03.036 --> 35:04.870
I was in the bathroom.

35:07.036 --> 35:09.196
I'm sorry I was mean.

35:09.356 --> 35:10.356
Forget it.

35:11.836 --> 35:13.670
Can I see you tonight?

35:14.876 --> 35:18.755
- I have plans tonight.
- Tomorrow? I leave tomorrow.

35:18.756 --> 35:21.955
What kind of plans?
You don't know anyone here.

35:21.956 --> 35:23.623
I make friends fast.

35:24.676 --> 35:26.176
Change your plans.

35:28.676 --> 35:30.556
- No.
- Please.

35:34.196 --> 35:37.835
You've got months and months
to negotiate with the Fiscal.

35:37.836 --> 35:41.675
It might not be anywhere
near as bad as you think.

35:41.676 --> 35:44.010
I know you're a good person.

35:45.036 --> 35:47.515
Come in with me and meet Skye.

35:47.516 --> 35:49.766
Don't sit here on your own.

35:56.116 --> 35:57.116
Skye?

36:00.436 --> 36:01.436
Come up.

36:09.036 --> 36:11.203
Have you come for the bed?

36:13.476 --> 36:15.835
Jesus, Skye. What are you doing?

36:15.836 --> 36:17.356
Who's this?

36:17.476 --> 36:18.556
Daniel.

36:18.716 --> 36:21.195
Brought your big car so
you could put the bed in, hey?

36:21.196 --> 36:23.555
What bed? Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.795
Skye, he doesn't know what
you're talking about.

36:25.796 --> 36:28.515
We've not come for the bed.
What's happened?

36:28.516 --> 36:30.723
- The police are with my mum.
- What?

36:30.724 --> 36:33.570
Do you think because your mum was
murdered you can do what you like?

36:33.571 --> 36:34.317
No.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.555
Report your friends to the
police just cos you feel like it?

36:36.556 --> 36:38.315
Skye, I didn't report you
to the police.

36:38.316 --> 36:41.076
I want you out. Now.

36:41.196 --> 36:42.635
Give me my keys. Chuck them.

36:42.636 --> 36:44.636
Emma, give her the keys.

36:50.596 --> 36:52.763
I don't trust you an inch.

36:53.876 --> 36:55.795
I hope you know what
you're getting into.

36:55.796 --> 36:58.795
- She's a piece of work.
- Skye, please, listen to me.

36:58.796 --> 37:00.996
Get your stuff and go.

37:01.116 --> 37:02.876
Come on. Come on.

37:14.756 --> 37:16.090
What a disgrace.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.195
To persecute a dying woman
in her hospital bed.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.435
I'm very sorry you feel
like that, Miss Alessi.

37:22.436 --> 37:24.995
Believe me, that's the last
thing we're here to do.

37:24.996 --> 37:27.795
As I say, we think you might
be able to help us,

37:27.796 --> 37:30.595
and we know what a treasured
friend Marie was to you,

37:30.596 --> 37:34.795
and we hoped you'd weigh that up
against any inconvenience caused.

37:34.796 --> 37:37.996
Oh, she was a treasured friend.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.875
Not a day goes by
I don't think of her.

37:39.876 --> 37:42.376
It was like losing part of me.

37:44.076 --> 37:46.826
Well, let's see this photo, then.

37:58.996 --> 38:00.956
Look at them.

38:01.076 --> 38:02.196
So young.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.700
So pretty.

38:09.436 --> 38:11.596
What can I tell you?

38:11.756 --> 38:13.236
I took it.

38:13.356 --> 38:14.876
They're in my bed.

38:15.076 --> 38:17.355
They had a pump from time to time,
for old time's sake,

38:17.356 --> 38:19.856
and that's all there is to it.

38:20.876 --> 38:23.355
There's another thing
I want to ask you about.

38:23.356 --> 38:25.435
It concerns Marie's body.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.995
I believe you mentioned
to Emma Hedges

38:26.996 --> 38:29.580
that Marie's bones were cut up.

38:30.116 --> 38:32.036
I... I don't remember.

38:33.436 --> 38:38.603
You don't remember saying it,
or you don't remember knowing it?

38:50.916 --> 38:53.276
I'm not a bad person.

38:53.356 --> 38:55.190
I don't think you are.

38:58.116 --> 39:00.116
Skye's my oldest friend.

39:01.156 --> 39:03.435
Her mum and my mum
had us a month apart.

39:03.436 --> 39:05.555
They put us in a cot together.

39:05.556 --> 39:09.473
We went to nursery together,
to school together.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.915
Skye's the sweetest, kindest
person you could meet.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.595
- She had a knife.
- Only because she's scared.

39:15.596 --> 39:17.476
Of what?

39:17.596 --> 39:20.513
What I might find out about my mum.

39:21.156 --> 39:23.240
Is it true what she said?

39:24.156 --> 39:26.573
- That your mum was...
- Yeah.

39:28.636 --> 39:31.553
They never found out what happened.

39:31.676 --> 39:32.676
Jesus, Emma.

39:34.636 --> 39:35.720
I'm going to.

39:43.476 --> 39:45.796
This was for my mum.

39:45.956 --> 39:49.956
The last time I saw her
was at a ship's festival.

39:52.796 --> 39:54.463
Did you report Skye?

39:55.796 --> 39:58.546
I had a chat with the police guy.

39:58.676 --> 40:00.915
What was all that about the bed?

40:00.916 --> 40:02.439
It was to do with my dad.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.507
Well, what's your
dad's bed doing there?

40:04.508 --> 40:06.762
It belongs to Izzy.
Skye's mum.

40:06.763 --> 40:08.828
But I don't understand
why the bed was...

40:08.829 --> 40:10.155
Well, neither do I!

40:10.156 --> 40:14.656
And I'm trying to think, OK?
I'm trying to work it out.

40:14.996 --> 40:15.996
I'm sorry.

40:18.036 --> 40:19.370
I'm scared, too.

40:34.676 --> 40:37.176
Live here as long as you want.

40:37.916 --> 40:39.675
This is such a big thing.

40:39.676 --> 40:41.010
Doesn't feel it.

40:43.116 --> 40:45.595
And I hope I don't bring you down.

40:45.596 --> 40:46.716
Hey?

40:46.796 --> 40:48.836
Going somewhere dark.

40:48.996 --> 40:51.995
Listen, I was charged with
culpable homicide this morning.

40:51.996 --> 40:53.596
I mean in my head.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.190
Can you talk about it?

41:26.716 --> 41:29.216
You know you can say anything.

41:30.316 --> 41:33.566
- And you won't run for the hills?
- No.

41:36.396 --> 41:37.730
This is the bed.

41:39.836 --> 41:41.670
That's my mum and dad.

41:42.436 --> 41:45.075
They used to meet at Izzy's
to have sex

41:45.076 --> 41:48.243
when my mum was married
to my step-dad.

41:49.516 --> 41:54.266
Yeah, me and Skye thought
it was a laugh when we found it.

41:54.836 --> 41:58.555
Skye said she'd ask Izzy about it,
but then she told me she hadn't.

41:58.556 --> 42:01.995
- Next thing, she's pulling a knife on us.
- To stop you taking the bed?

42:01.996 --> 42:04.795
And why would the bed
be worth taking?

42:04.796 --> 42:06.315
If there was evidence on it.

42:06.316 --> 42:09.155
What if my mum was
murdered on that bed?

42:09.156 --> 42:10.515
What if it was Izzy that did it?

42:10.516 --> 42:12.195
Have you got a number
for your police guy?

42:12.196 --> 42:12.998
But what if I'm wrong?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.075
You need to tell them
before they can destroy...

42:15.076 --> 42:18.635
- Izzy's a friend, and she's ill.
- I know! But you've got to call them.

42:18.636 --> 42:21.955
It can't be wrong to say you know
where the bed is cos you do.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.373
I'll back you up.

42:29.876 --> 42:31.376
Hello, Emma.
