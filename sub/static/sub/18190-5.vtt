00:09.200 --> 00:13.230
Orpheus may be blind but he sees
more than any man I've ever known.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.239
~ They're headed for the mountains.
~ We should catch them by nightfall.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.160
Get the others out of here.
I'll try and hold them off.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.870
What is this place?

00:24.920 --> 00:26.160
You no longer need me.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.160
Nooooo!

00:38.840 --> 00:40.280
Jason!

02:01.760 --> 02:05.070
O psukhai khthoniai,

02:05.120 --> 02:12.040
deomai tethnkotas andras
humon proskaleein,

02:13.560 --> 02:21.400
tous oulomenous ge
makhetas na prascuto.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.320
Do you think he survived the fall?
I'm certain he survived.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.350
We can only hope.
It's too steep to climb.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.560
We'll have to find another way down.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.470
Is there any sign of him?

02:57.520 --> 02:59.270
None. I'm sorry.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.720
The boy has survived worse.
We'll find him.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.870
I refuse to believe he's dead.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.270
Because it is unthinkable.
We will do all we can to help.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.360
Thank you.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.470
Ah!

04:05.520 --> 04:06.960
~ What is it? ~ I heard something.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.190
I hear nothing.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.160
When you lose one sense,
others grow sharper.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.000
Perhaps it was Jason?

04:21.480 --> 04:23.000
Or perhaps it's something else.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.710
Bats?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.280
When is it ever bats?

05:06.320 --> 05:07.430
I heard it.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.280
Jason must have managed to climb up.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.030
Jason?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.120
Jason?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.440
That's not Jason.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.960
Who's there?

05:36.720 --> 05:37.790
It's Dion!

05:37.840 --> 05:39.080
He was dead. How can that be?

05:42.560 --> 05:44.550
This is a gift from the Gods!

05:44.600 --> 05:45.640
Argh!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.880
~ He bit me! ~ Dion?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.870
What's happened to him?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.840
Stay back! I have no desire
to harm you.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.990
What do I do?

05:58.040 --> 06:01.280
Whatever that is, it's not
the Dion we knew. Kill him.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.350
Hercules! Kill him!

06:08.400 --> 06:09.600
I'm trying!

06:10.680 --> 06:12.440
Hercules, there's more of them!

06:14.120 --> 06:15.160
Hurry!

06:17.320 --> 06:20.000
Go! Go, go, go!

06:27.320 --> 06:29.200
Go, run! Run, run!

07:36.120 --> 07:38.270
~ What are those things?
~ Why won't they die?

07:38.320 --> 07:41.110
If Dion is one of them, we must
assume that they are the dead.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.710
They have been brought back to life?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.110
It is known as necromancy.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.190
The others, they looked
like soldiers.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.270
Before he died,

07:48.320 --> 07:52.190
King Hipparchus ordered the
slaughter of his entire army.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.790
He wanted them buried with him so
they could protect him in Hades.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.790
And these soldiers have now risen
from their tombs, all of them?

07:58.840 --> 08:01.830
To break the sacred divide
between the living

08:01.880 --> 08:04.990
and the dead requires great power.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.030
Pasiphae.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.310
Then she isn't dead.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.190
We have to find a way to stop them.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.870
I've tried. Trust me.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.230
It's easier said than done.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.470
Dion's first instinct
was to bite you.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.800
We must assume that they mean
to kill us and feast on our flesh.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.950
We must see to your wound.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.040
It's nothing.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.480
Hello?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.000
Hercules, is that you?

09:26.280 --> 09:28.080
That should stop the bleeding.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.880
This is impossible!

09:48.920 --> 09:50.600
~ It is dead?
~ Twice over.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.630
It was the final strike
that felled it. The heart.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.510
It seems they can be killed
by piercing the heart.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.870
Never underestimate the value
of scientific deduction.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.040
Is that what I was doing?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.360
Pythagoras!

10:53.680 --> 10:55.080
Your Highness.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.270
I think we lost them.
What are those things?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.560
I believe they are the dead.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.150
You came back for me?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.710
~ I nearly didn't.
~ We're enemies?

11:14.760 --> 11:17.510
Yeah, well, I guess
that makes me a fool.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.030
Pasiphae has always taught me
that my enemies would kill me

11:20.080 --> 11:22.070
as soon as look at me.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.190
She's wrong. She's wrong
about many things.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.960
Your enemies are not like her.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.270
Who is she to you?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.470
She's my blood.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.630
How can the dead have risen?

11:36.680 --> 11:39.590
There's only one person
who could have done this.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.470
Pasiphae.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.640
They're not going
to be far behind us.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.750
Are you coming, or are you
just going to wait for them?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.070
What are they?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.990
~ They're tombs.
~ There's hundreds of them.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.510
And inside each one there was
a corpse that has now risen

12:07.560 --> 12:09.150
and means to feed on our flesh.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.710
~ What is wrong with you? ~ Sorry.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.750
~ Oh! ~ Diagoras? ~ I just need
to sit for a moment.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.750
I don't understand how the wound
has become infected so quickly.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.790
Can you treat it?

12:17.840 --> 12:21.630
I don't know. It's like no infection
I have ever seen before.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.160
We must find a place to hold up.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.870
Hercules. What about Jason?
We have to find him.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.150
Diagoras is too weak to continue.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
I have to see to his wound.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.630
We should shelter in a tomb,
one of those higher up.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.030
We'll be out of sight.
There's only one entrance.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.830
~ We can defend it.
~ Tombs are for the dead.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.110
Well, if the dead have risen,

12:43.160 --> 12:46.720
then its previous inhabitant will
no longer have use for it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.880
Ariadne, why do you risk
your life for her?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.360
She is my Queen. I swore an oath.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.560
There's more to it than that.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.470
There can't be.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
You have affection
for her, do you not?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.040
Why are you loyal to Pasiphae?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.070
Do you even know?

13:18.120 --> 13:21.800
I have been shunned all my life.
People fear me.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.920
Because of your sorcery?

13:27.840 --> 13:31.000
Pasiphae is the only person
who has ever shown me kindness.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.110
I didn't believe her capable
of kindness.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.560
You don't know her as I do.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.390
She slaughters anyone
who stands in her way.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.150
You must see what she does is wrong?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.120
She does what is necessary to take
her rightful place on the throne.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.630
And you've never questioned that?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.110
I've never had cause to question it.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.040
Well, perhaps it's time you did.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.120
I've done all I can for now.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.280
I know he would be grateful.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.910
Did you know from the moment
you saw Orpheus that you would

14:25.960 --> 14:27.070
be together?

14:27.120 --> 14:30.480
I didn't even see him at first.
I heard him sing.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.360
Then I saw him.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.920
I knew I'd changed forever.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.720
It was the same with Jason.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.960
I tried to pretend
it wasn't so.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.000
What if I never have
the chance to tell him?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.240
You will, I'm sure of it.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.200
You should get some rest.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.800
As comfortable as you can, in a tomb.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.830
I can't stop thinking about Jason.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.870
He's somewhere out there,
among the dead.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.960
I know.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.310
I try to protect him the best
I can but perhaps it is beyond me.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.520
You are not to blame.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.400
It is my decisions
that cost Dion his life.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.350
If Jason were to die because of me,
I would never forgive myself.

15:48.400 --> 15:53.630
Jason is faster and better with a
sword than any man I have ever met.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.680
If anything, those things
should be afraid of him.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.760
I will pray to the Gods
that is true.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.950
His fever's worsened.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.560
You did everything you could.
It's in the hands of the Gods now.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.110
When did you last get some sleep?

16:42.160 --> 16:46.390
I don't remember. I'm so tired
I can barely think straight.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.470
You should get some rest,
while you have the chance.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.240
If we're to get out of here alive,
we need that big brain of yours.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.240
~ What about you? ~ Sleeping is for
women, and babies, and men like you.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.870
Warriors like myself,
we don't need sleep.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.869
You sleep more than any man
I have ever known.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.960
~ Maybe that's what I want
you to think? ~ Why?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.160
Just shut up and go to sleep.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.070
All the wounds are to the heart.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.440
So, they can be killed.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.030
My friends are still alive. Come on.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.240
We need to find them.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.960
My leg. I think it's broken!

18:40.200 --> 18:43.230
~ Let me see. ~ I can't stand up.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.480
The bone has snapped.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.840
~ What are you doing? ~ Trust me.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.720
Argh!

19:08.360 --> 19:09.400
You healed me?

19:11.680 --> 19:15.110
It seems you don't feel the same way
about your enemies as Pasiphae does.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.560
You were wrong about her.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.390
She raised the dead, knowing
you were in the necropolis.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.910
Perhaps she thought
I died in the fall.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.070
She had no way of knowing that.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.190
She didn't think to come
looking for you.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.550
She doesn't care about you.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.390
Do not say that!

19:32.440 --> 19:33.760
I have no-one else.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.880
What? We need to find my friends.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.150
Argh!

20:08.200 --> 20:09.240
Diagoras?

20:15.480 --> 20:16.640
By your right hand!

20:17.960 --> 20:21.800
Orpheus! The knife!
By your right hand!

20:23.600 --> 20:30.080
Up a bit! There!

20:34.760 --> 20:35.950
Hercules!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.990
What?! What's going on!?

20:38.040 --> 20:39.390
You fell asleep.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.560
I may have nodded off momentarily.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.950
What happened?

20:46.000 --> 20:49.600
It seems if we are bitten,
we become one of them.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.840
Oh, no.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.000
~ What is it?
~ Your arm.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
~ Did he bite you?
~ I don't know. I fell.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.160
May I?

21:10.080 --> 21:11.120
Well?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.750
It's a cut. It's just a cut.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.000
Praise the Gods.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.760
It seems sleep isn't just for women,
and babies, and men like me.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.510
Eurydice? Did you get hurt?

21:35.560 --> 21:38.360
No. I'm fine. It was just a shock.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.950
To see our friend change like that.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.320
There was nothing left
of the man we knew.

21:50.160 --> 21:55.320
Do not be concerned for me.
I'm fine.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.190
At least we can resume
our search for Jason.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.800
I think we might be stuck here
a while longer.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.110
What will happen when
we find your friends?

22:26.160 --> 22:27.270
What do you mean?

22:27.320 --> 22:30.310
You believe Ariadne will
welcome me with open arms?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.800
She will most likely order you
to execute me on the spot.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.840
What will you say if she does?
You have sworn an oath.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.510
I won't let any harm come to you.
You have my word.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.950
Why would you protect me?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.040
You saved my life.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.790
You believe that changes anything?

22:49.840 --> 22:52.240
Do not think for one moment
that I will betray Pasiphae.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.190
Surely you have already betrayed
her by saving my life?

23:01.240 --> 23:05.310
Perhaps I did it just so you
could protect me from the dead?

23:05.360 --> 23:06.600
I don't believe that.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.320
Eurydice?

23:20.200 --> 23:22.160
You feel hot.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.310
It's just the air in this tomb.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.720
I may be blind, but I can
hear it in your voice.

23:32.760 --> 23:37.520
~ What? ~ Fear. You are afraid.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.720
Of course I'm afraid.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.080
Tell me. Tell me what it is.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.400
You have a fever.

23:56.240 --> 24:01.400
No, no, no, no. Please. Please,
tell me it can't be that.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.880
~ He bit me. ~ When?

24:09.520 --> 24:12.120
Diagoras.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.400
My arm.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.760
No. It cannot be.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.960
Eurydice doesn't seem herself.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.960
~ How so? ~ I don't know.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.790
We're trapped in a tomb,
surrounded by the living dead.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.080
Nobody is themselves.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.110
It looks like we're heading
in the right direction.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.310
~ We have to go back.
~ My friends are that way.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.720
So are the dead. We have to go.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.360
Give me your torch. Quick!

25:10.640 --> 25:12.720
~ Now we cannot see. ~ Neither can they.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.280
What if they can see in the dark?

26:02.880 --> 26:04.160
Something's wrong.

26:09.400 --> 26:14.870
Orpheus and Eurydice. They've
been sitting there for ages.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.470
They haven't said a word
to each other.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.840
That's marriage for you.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.160
I once knew a couple,
they didn't speak for a year.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.960
When the wife was in my arms,
she would not stop talking.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.400
Orpheus?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.710
I wondered if you might
like some water.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.240
I'm fine. Thank you.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.790
Eurydice?

26:43.840 --> 26:46.230
She's fine. She's resting.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.720
Is everything all right?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.720
Please, my friend.
Please, just leave us alone.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.430
If you tell me what's wrong,
perhaps I can help?

26:57.480 --> 26:59.640
~ No-one can help.
~ What is it?

27:01.720 --> 27:02.880
Orpheus, please.

27:04.440 --> 27:09.960
I expected that we would see
out our last days together.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.830
How long has she been like this?

27:18.880 --> 27:20.750
You can do nothing for her.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.630
Is she hurt? Let me examine her.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.080
You could do nothing
to help Diagoras.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.360
She was bitten?

27:28.520 --> 27:29.600
Her arm.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.920
We wanted to have these
last moments together.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.680
I am truly sorry.
I will give you a moment alone.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.120
What is it?

27:59.760 --> 28:01.680
It's Eurydice.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.240
She's been bitten.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.080
How long does she have?

28:08.200 --> 28:11.670
If the wound is anything
to go by, not long.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.760
What do we do?

28:15.200 --> 28:17.510
There's only one thing we can do.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.750
No.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.950
She will become one of them.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.550
We cannot risk another
one of us being bitten.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.310
We have no choice.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.590
You would kill her, in front of
her husband, who loves her
more than anything?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.680
Look at them.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.440
I'll do it.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.990
We can't ask that of you.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.790
I cannot expect my people
to do things

28:38.840 --> 28:40.240
I am not prepared to do myself.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.880
You must be sure
to pierce the heart.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.280
You have come to kill her?

29:22.400 --> 29:24.280
If there were any other way, I...

29:26.400 --> 29:29.630
She is everything to me.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.080
She is my world.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.360
I know. But soon she will no longer
be the woman you love.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.590
She will turn on you
and she will kill you.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.950
She would never forgive herself
if she hurt you.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.360
She wouldn't want it.

29:53.560 --> 29:58.600
If anyone is to end her life,
it will be me.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.160
I'm sorry, my love.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.440
This isn't the end.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.440
Not even Hades can keep us apart.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.680
I will come for you, Eurydice.

30:32.760 --> 30:33.960
I promise.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.640
So many tombs. We shouldn't
linger here.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.200
There. It has to be them.

31:54.520 --> 31:55.640
How can you be sure?

31:58.920 --> 32:00.280
The dead don't light fires.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.000
I hope one day somebody
loves me like that.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.600
Somebody already does.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.630
I mean, pretty girl like you.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.120
You must be beating them off
with a stick - Your Highness.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.430
Jason?!

32:41.480 --> 32:43.550
I nearly took your head off,
you fool!

32:43.600 --> 32:46.070
I'm lucky you're so useless
with a sword then.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.440
I feared you were dead.

32:49.720 --> 32:50.840
What's she doing here?!

32:53.440 --> 32:54.510
She's with me.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.990
What do you mean she's with you?

32:56.040 --> 32:57.870
She's a witch of Colchis.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.830
~ I mean you no harm. ~ I should
cut you down where you stand.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.270
~ Hercules.
~ Take her knife.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.630
I promised I would protect her.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.750
You should not be making
promises to my enemies.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.910
Well, I owe her my life.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.670
Look, she could have left me to die.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.870
I have seen good in her.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.110
~ There is no good in her.
~ You're wrong.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.350
Let me put an end to this.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.790
No, I gave her my word that
no harm would come to her.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.510
I made no such promise.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.670
She will kill us the first chance
she gets.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.470
~ I don't believe that. ~ There is
little to be gained in sparing her.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.990
I can't let you do this.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.110
Your faith in people
will get you killed.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.070
I won't allow that to happen.
Now, step aside.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.230
If you kill me, you will not
escape the necropolis.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.950
Lies, to save your own skin.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.790
I speak the truth. I know
how to vanquish the dead.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.310
We already know how to kill them.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.950
You believe you can fight your way
through thousands of them?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.990
~ If we have to.
~ I know how to end the curse

33:45.040 --> 33:47.030
that raised them from their graves.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.950
I do not want to die
any more than you,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.480
but if we are to escape with our
lives, you have to trust me.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.880
Never.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.840
It seems we have no choice.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.960
Then tell us.
How do we lift the curse?

34:07.200 --> 34:09.000
We must return to
the place it was cast.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.230
I don't trust her.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.469
It will take more than some dark
hair and pretty eyes to fool me.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.190
Really? Because usually
that's all it takes.

34:26.239 --> 34:29.190
We'll have to watch her like a bat.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.510
Bats are blind.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.520
We'll have to watch her like
something with really good eyesight.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.710
A hawk.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.560
We will watch her like a hawk.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.360
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.640
This is not the end.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.630
Stand up. Put your hands
behind your back.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.750
What's going on?

35:17.800 --> 35:20.830
I'm not going anywhere with her
unless her hands are tied.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.550
She won't be able to defend herself.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.230
She also won't be able to plunge
a knife into our backs.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.480
If this is what it takes for your
friends to feel safe, then so be it.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.440
Jason.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.480
What is it?

35:43.760 --> 35:45.840
For a moment I thought
I had lost you.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.520
I couldn't bear it.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.480
~ You don't need to worry about me.
~ I couldn't help myself.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.080
For as long as I remember I have
been told I am a Goddess on Earth.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.830
The truth is, I'm no different
to anyone else.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.190
You're the Queen now.
I have accepted that.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.910
Why should you accept it?

36:12.960 --> 36:14.320
Why should either of us?

36:19.120 --> 36:23.990
I know I hurt you.
I pushed you away.

36:24.040 --> 36:28.550
I am so ashamed of how I behaved.

36:28.600 --> 36:29.640
I was scared.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.800
I have lived my whole life in fear.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.920
In fear of how people
might judge me.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.120
I refuse to do so any longer.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.480
What I mean to say is...

36:49.240 --> 36:50.920
I have tried so hard to deny it.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.440
Deny what?

36:55.760 --> 36:58.830
From the moment I saw you,

36:58.880 --> 37:01.640
I knew what it meant to love someone
with all my heart.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.760
I have faced death.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.680
But nothing scares me more
than admitting that I love you.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.680
Say something.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.760
Get behind me!

37:47.080 --> 37:48.120
Come on.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.790
Pasiphae fell further along.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.030
We must assume that's where
she cast the spell.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.830
Now we will find out
if you're telling the truth.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.470
It is a binding spell.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.190
There will be some ancient symbols,
perhaps carved into stone.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.470
~ You must find them and destroy them.
~ How can you be sure they exist?

38:14.520 --> 38:17.200
Because the curse would
not hold without them.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.470
I have heard this to be true.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.190
If you're lying, you won't
live to regret it.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.760
I have no reason to lie to you.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.880
Wait here.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.640
Jason.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.310
Be careful.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.870
I suppose I'm going to have
to go with you, aren't I?

38:35.920 --> 38:37.870
You could just tell everyone
you came with me.

38:37.920 --> 38:42.520
~ When have I ever done that?
~ Frequently. ~ Watch her. ~ Like a hawk.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.670
Hold on!

39:06.720 --> 39:07.960
What do you think I'm doing!?

39:20.880 --> 39:26.070
This is the last time I let you
talk me into anything like this.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.520
I seriously doubt that.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.880
Can you see anything?

39:47.520 --> 39:48.680
I see dead soldiers.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
Hercules! The tomb!

40:21.400 --> 40:22.680
Hercules!

40:35.080 --> 40:36.280
Hercules!

40:56.000 --> 40:57.960
You care for Jason very much,
do you not?

40:59.440 --> 41:01.440
I am not about to share
my feelings with you.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.030
Jason?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.590
The heroes have returned.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.350
Did you do it?

41:10.400 --> 41:15.350
Actually, it was me who tossed the
stone off the edge of the cavern.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.190
I'm just making sure everyone
knows the true story.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.070
Since when have you cared
if a story is true?

41:21.120 --> 41:22.710
Let me help you.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.000
You believe me now?

41:25.400 --> 41:28.800
I always believed you.
Give me your hands.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.920
It seems we are in your debt.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.560
There's your bag.

41:37.440 --> 41:38.550
Thank you.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.350
Now, can we please get out of here?

41:40.400 --> 41:41.520
Mind your footing.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.960
~ Let her go! ~ Jason!

41:47.240 --> 41:48.990
What are you doing?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.360
What I intended all along.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.720
No!

41:56.040 --> 41:57.120
Ariadne?!

42:15.840 --> 42:19.120
If she dies, I will
never forgive myself.

42:22.280 --> 42:26.160
Medea! I will find you
and I will kill you!
