00:06.040 --> 00:08.873
Ryn?
Are you all right?

00:10.290 --> 00:12.110
No baby.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.169
We can't just take Ryn
to a fertility clinic.

00:15.170 --> 00:17.661
Beth-- her people--
they have their own doctors.

00:17.670 --> 00:19.114
[news director]
This isn't proof of anything.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.078
You want to know
what real evidence would be?

00:22.080 --> 00:23.911
Her.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.286
Miles out to sea,
and there aren't
any other boats around.

Trauma sometimes,
twisting things in our brains.

00:30.170 --> 00:32.877
Yeah. Woman under the water
doesn't make any sense.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.950
We're so glad you're here.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.746
This is Leena, our doctor.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.991
The procedure went
exceptionally well.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.160
And Ryn?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.535
-[Leena] She's gone.
-No!No!

00:41.540 --> 00:43.917
-Ryn! Don't take her!
-Ryn!

00:45.080 --> 00:46.035
You wanted evidence, right?

00:47.540 --> 00:48.575
I got it.

-Come on!
-I'm trying!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.245

[panting] She's okay.

03:51.170 --> 03:53.411
She got away.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.958
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that--

03:59.210 --> 04:00.245
take her.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.450
You saved my life.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.569
Thank you.

Where is he now?

04:21.330 --> 04:23.912
Probably back in Seattle.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.878
And you think
he'll keep the secret?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.609
Ben saved his life.

04:28.620 --> 04:29.917
He was grateful for that,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.536
and we think
he'll stay quiet.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.872
[Helen] We hope.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.279
But at the moment,
I'm more worried

04:36.290 --> 04:37.609
about the damage he did.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.702
Ryn could have been
pregnant right now.

04:39.710 --> 04:40.950
Because we lost time,

04:40.960 --> 04:43.451
those embryos
are no longer viable.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.667
Maybe we try again
another time.

04:45.670 --> 04:48.161
To make baby
with science.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.286
Hey, turn that up.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.746
That all sounds
pretty far-fetched.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.490
[scoffs] Yeah, well,

04:58.500 --> 05:02.038
sometimes truth is stranger
than fiction, right?

And there are others.

Look, all I can say is

05:10.750 --> 05:12.377
play the footage.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.824

15 days ago,

07:10.920 --> 07:12.569

07:12.580 --> 07:14.241
after groups of tourists,

on the town.

Meanwhile, the US Government
continues to install

07:38.460 --> 07:41.202
a network
of offshore sonic cannons.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.201
The expectation being
that these devices,

07:43.210 --> 07:46.077
originally developed
for oil exploration,

07:46.080 --> 07:48.207
may force more
of the creatures
from the water.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.997
There are continued reports
out of Malaysia

07:51.000 --> 07:53.821
claiming they have obtained
a creature of their own,

07:53.830 --> 07:56.037
with sources alleging
it is being held

07:56.040 --> 07:58.031
in a state-run facility
where it will be studied

07:58.040 --> 08:00.952
and put on display
to an eager public.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.575
And, around the globe,

08:02.580 --> 08:04.241
citizens are
now bitterly dIVIded

over the treatment_

in a growing list of nations

08:09.330 --> 08:11.616

and protection.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.748
We will welcome them,
provide a safe haven for them,

and ultimately,
if they so desire,

08:16.540 --> 08:18.326
a path to citizenship
in our country.

of the existence
of the marine creatures,

out of the water forever.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.116
Look, you gotta
get out of here.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.031
It's not safe.

will calm down

I heard rumors
that a blood test
is being developed

to identify our kind.

to take care of yourself.

across the border.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.535
What can I do?

10:03.620 --> 10:05.781
If you can get us a car,

10:05.790 --> 10:09.203
drive it out of town
past the checkpomt,

10:09.210 --> 10:10.416
we can get
as close as we can,

10:10.420 --> 10:11.569
then cross on foot.

10:11.580 --> 10:13.662
That's pretty rough country.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.820
There's a place I know.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.742
One summer, my dad and I
went backpacking up there,

10:18.750 --> 10:20.240

crossed the border.

It's about

-I know.
-All right. Go on.

Come on.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.075

Calvin's been letting me
keep this stuff here.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.288

-Where is he?
-Oh, you know,

13:23.880 --> 13:26.451
he's out on the water,
looking for a payday.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.325
You know they're offering
a hundred million for one--

13:31.250 --> 13:35.869
Um, anyway,
every deckhand in town's
on a feeding frenzy, so...

13:35.880 --> 13:38.451
The sooner we get away
from the coast,
the safer we'll be.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.200

It was in the closet.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.450
You're helping them.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.573
We got enough trouble
with the military
after them, Xan.

We're gonna need

allowed to come and go.

Am I wrong about that?

It's not bull, Silas.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.110
We were on that boat
when the very first one
was caught.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.496
Hell, we're the ones
that caught her.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.910
That's what started
this whole thing.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.536
So you say.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.076
But it's been three weeks

18:16.080 --> 18:17.616
since the military
caught those other two,

18:17.620 --> 18:19.451
and I don't see you
getting another.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.529
We're working on it.

This makes no sense.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.610
I mean, why are we here?

28:49.620 --> 28:51.918
Where the hell are we?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.576
This ain't no research facility.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.615
Oh, yeah, ya think?

28:57.960 --> 28:59.951
We just gotta get paid

28:59.960 --> 29:01.245

[suspenseful music]

29:19.120 --> 29:20.326
Stay down.

29:20.330 --> 29:21.456
Don't move.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.577
Ben's father is here.

29:39.580 --> 29:40.740
And mine.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.161
You need to tell your men
to stand down.

29:47.170 --> 29:48.614
My daughter is in there.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.747
This wasn't the plan.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.206
You know damn well

29:52.210 --> 29:54.576
that a hostage situation
has to be negotiated.

29:54.580 --> 29:55.990
This is
not a hostage situation.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.570
This is three armed fugitives.

29:57.580 --> 29:58.956
I'll go in there
and talk to him.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.949
We could end this
peacefully.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.286
All right,
you have five minutes.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.535

What did you do?

30:37.250 --> 30:38.239
Ben,

30:40.080 --> 30:41.536
-I did it for you.
-Bul|shit.

30:42.670 --> 30:44.206
That's bullshit.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.031
Ben, you need
to talk to these guys.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.746
Okay? It's not too late.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.206
You can make a deal.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.370
-A deal?
-Yeah.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.201
What, I give her up
and save myself?

30:54.210 --> 30:55.950
Is that the idea?

30:59.790 --> 31:02.202
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

What did they do to you?

[gaSPSI

They've been using us
for tests.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.569
What kind of tests?

31:16.580 --> 31:18.662
To see how fast we can heal.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.785
Ohh.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.239
You caused this.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.497
-All of it.
-What are you talking about?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.240
You shared our secret
with the humans.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.161
They never would've
found out about us,

31:31.170 --> 31:32.876
and none of this
would have happened.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.701

I knew we could trust.

The Pownalls are
not the problem here.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.820
Ah, of course.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.491
You're one of them.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.161
What did I expect?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.956
You should be ashamed
of yourself,

your own kind.

31:50.830 --> 31:52.957
Here? Now?

31:55.710 --> 31:57.325
Don't move.

31:57.330 --> 31:58.957
I can get them to promise
they won't harm her.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.952
Why would I believe one word
you say to me ever again?

32:01.960 --> 32:03.325
Huh?

32:03.330 --> 32:06.163
Ben, I did it for you,
to keep you safe.

-To keep me safe?
-Yeah, to keep you safe.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.707
You were never gonna
make it out of here alive.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.871
That is not true.

We could've made it.

Ben, you're
not thinking straight.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.245
You're gonna help us get out.

not a good idea, Ben.

-Move.

it was an accident.

with the rest of the world.

of Elaine's accident.

have an "in" down there.

you went to see Susan?

from that night,

all that up again?

remember exactly what happened.

I can look into that.

I appreciate it.

Didn't cost him a cent.

Oh, I see.
You bought it.

for what happened,

39:27.250 --> 39:29.036
but he brought it
on himself,

39:29.040 --> 39:30.780
and it's because of him

39:30.790 --> 39:32.917
that Ryn couldn't have
that embryo implanted.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.166
But the heartbeat
is strong.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.036
That's a positive sign.

41:09.330 --> 41:10.570
That's my girl.

41:12.830 --> 41:16.243
Pretty soon, we'll have
a full blood of our very own.

41:31.290 --> 41:33.201
[high-pitched call]

41:37.210 --> 41:40.077
[atmospheric music]
