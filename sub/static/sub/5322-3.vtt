WEBVTT

00:01.812 --> 00:02.699
Oh!

00:03.950 --> 00:05.718
I am so depressed.

00:05.752 --> 00:07.753
I never want to go to
the farmer's market again.

00:07.788 --> 00:10.289
We don't even deserve this kale.

00:11.391 --> 00:12.525
I wanna kale myself.

00:14.161 --> 00:15.836
Why did we have to run into Lizette?

00:15.858 --> 00:18.259
- Lizette.
- Lizette?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.967
How does thin-lipped Lizette from
High School have a lip-balm empire?

00:22.002 --> 00:24.770
Remember when people used
to call her "lizard lips"?

00:24.805 --> 00:27.945
Yeah. Wow, we were so mean.

00:29.339 --> 00:30.743
Yeah, for someone so busy,

00:30.744 --> 00:32.908
she certainly had plenty of
time to brag about herself.

00:34.974 --> 00:37.516
I can't believe we're
23 and already washed up.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.968
Right? What happened to our dreams?

00:39.969 --> 00:41.643
You were gonna be the next Julia Child

00:41.644 --> 00:43.044
with your own restaurant and cookbook

00:43.045 --> 00:45.091
and TV show. You were gonna have an empire.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.826
Yeah, I don't have that.

00:48.194 --> 00:50.474
And I don't have a corner
office on Wall Street

00:50.475 --> 00:52.631
with a hot assistant who's
secretly in love with me.

00:53.599 --> 00:55.701
- This is a wake-up call.
- Yes it is.

00:55.736 --> 00:57.603
- We got to start networking.
- Yes we do.

00:57.637 --> 00:59.467
We've got to start
emailing all the successful

00:59.493 --> 01:01.374
people we know to help
us get to the next level.

01:01.408 --> 01:03.509
Yes, I'm doing that right now.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.933
Okay.

01:06.924 --> 01:10.293
Wow, I don't know any successful people.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.818
Ooh, do you remember Logan Rawlings?

01:12.853 --> 01:14.567
The lesbian magazine editor

01:14.568 --> 01:16.448
- you fake-dated to help Josh.
- Yeah!

01:16.449 --> 01:19.692
She's totally successful and could
totally help me get to the next level.

01:20.761 --> 01:22.361
What is the next level?

01:23.278 --> 01:26.153
Okay, well you know all those food
articles you read about? And then

01:26.154 --> 01:28.434
you're like, "I could've written
that," but you never write anything?

01:28.435 --> 01:30.102
Yeah, I'm really good at that.

01:31.196 --> 01:34.340
Well, why don't you write a
food article for her magazine?

01:34.374 --> 01:36.942
That is a great idea, Sofia.

01:36.943 --> 01:38.744
You are the smartest loser I know.

02:02.702 --> 02:06.005
- Morning, guys.
- Hey-y-y.

02:06.039 --> 02:07.873
How's it going, buddy?

02:07.908 --> 02:10.675
Aw, are you okay? Do you need a hug?

02:10.710 --> 02:13.646
Look, I know it's been a rough few
weeks with my wedding being called off

02:13.680 --> 02:15.815
and Gabi getting back with
Cooper, but I'm over it.

02:15.849 --> 02:17.716
I'm fine.

02:17.751 --> 02:19.585
- Aw.
- Sure you are.

02:19.619 --> 02:20.920
- Such a trooper.
- Yeah.

02:20.954 --> 02:23.022
Hey, stop it. I'm serious.

02:23.056 --> 02:24.494
I've moved on.

02:24.495 --> 02:26.625
And if you guys want your
paychecks, you will too.

02:26.660 --> 02:29.256
Wow, look how fit you are.

02:29.257 --> 02:31.564
Must be all that moving on you're doing.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.668
Hey, guys, guess what?

02:35.702 --> 02:38.610
You're moving to China. So sad. Bye!

02:39.873 --> 02:41.674
No.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.506
I decided I needed to take
my career to the next level,

02:44.507 --> 02:46.450
so I called Logan Rawlings...

02:46.451 --> 02:48.647
Remember? The lesbian that
Elliot pimped me out to?

02:48.682 --> 02:51.414
That was funny.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.080
Well, she called me back and
she wants to hear my ideas

02:55.081 --> 02:56.889
on a food article written by me.

02:56.923 --> 02:59.625
Gabi, that's great. I feel nothing...

03:01.661 --> 03:02.995
but happiness...

03:03.601 --> 03:04.801
for you.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.967
Oh, that's Cooper.

03:08.001 --> 03:11.280
Hi, sweetcakes. I have the best news.

03:12.806 --> 03:14.673
See? She's talking to Cooper

03:15.742 --> 03:16.876
and I'm fine.

03:18.575 --> 03:20.587
No, my news isn't that I miss you.

03:20.588 --> 03:22.581
That wouldn't be news.
I miss you all the time,

03:22.616 --> 03:23.849
my super Cooper bear.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.920
See, I'm...

03:27.954 --> 03:29.922
Not fine. I will be in my office

03:29.956 --> 03:31.924
with my noise-canceling headphones.

03:35.205 --> 03:37.139
My check's wrong.

03:37.574 --> 03:38.841
Josh overpaid me.

03:39.032 --> 03:40.866
Like way overpaid me.

03:42.068 --> 03:43.836
Well, he way underpaid me.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.400
Oh wait.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.168
This is your check.

03:51.711 --> 03:53.479
You make more money than me?

03:53.513 --> 03:55.941
You're his housekeeper. I'm his publicist!

03:55.942 --> 03:58.183
So? I've been with Josh for a long time.

03:58.212 --> 03:59.405
Exactly.

03:59.449 --> 04:01.704
Shouldn't he realize how worthless you are?

04:05.372 --> 04:07.273
Oh, stop it.

04:07.930 --> 04:10.563
All you got to do is walk
in there and ask for a raise.

04:10.597 --> 04:12.498
I do it every other month.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.434
I could never do that.

04:15.705 --> 04:17.005
Why not?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.374
Look, I know I come off

04:19.375 --> 04:21.041
as this confident

04:21.043 --> 04:23.525
self-assured renaissance man...

04:24.377 --> 04:26.078
To who?

04:27.247 --> 04:28.865
But, when I was a kid,

04:28.866 --> 04:30.849
the one time I asked
for a bigger allowance,

04:30.884 --> 04:32.851
my dad went crazy.

04:32.886 --> 04:35.052
I made 50 cents a week till I was 18.

04:36.053 --> 04:39.059
By the time I saved up enough
money to go to a Wham! concert,

04:39.090 --> 04:40.559
they broke up!

04:44.631 --> 04:46.398
Miss Gabi Diamond.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.985
Hey, Logan, thank you
so much for seeing me.

04:48.986 --> 04:51.016
When I told my friends that I had a meeting

04:51.017 --> 04:53.138
- with the great Logan Rawlings...
- Don't.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.208
Don't do that.

04:56.242 --> 04:58.003
Don't don't do what?

04:58.004 --> 05:00.482
- Kiss my ass.
- Oh.

05:00.483 --> 05:02.748
No, no, no, I wouldn't. I mean, I couldn't.

05:02.782 --> 05:04.583
I mean... you should talk now.

05:04.618 --> 05:06.943
I want a totally unique and hip take

05:06.944 --> 05:09.321
on the San Francisco food scene
that hasn't been done before.

05:09.356 --> 05:12.224
Well, I have a ton of cool ideas.

05:12.258 --> 05:13.459
And I have two minutes.

05:15.362 --> 05:17.062
Are you stroking out? Go.

05:17.099 --> 05:17.725
Oh...

05:18.465 --> 05:21.833
Okay, well, you know how everybody
these days is eating pretzels?

05:22.065 --> 05:23.035
No.

05:24.170 --> 05:26.005
Well, they are. I was thinking

05:26.039 --> 05:27.973
"30 New Twists on Pretzels."

05:28.008 --> 05:29.742
Get it? Pretzel? Twist.

05:30.977 --> 05:33.445
Here's a twist. I love it 0%.

05:35.276 --> 05:37.331
Okay, well, I have a ton of other ideas.

05:37.332 --> 05:39.518
Like "How to Impress with a Panini."

05:39.552 --> 05:41.320
Get it? Panini? Impress?

05:42.398 --> 05:44.081
You know what I'm gonna press? This button.

05:44.107 --> 05:47.393
- Rafael, please show Miss Diamond out.
- No, no, no, listen, Logan.

05:47.427 --> 05:48.852
I am a great chef.

05:48.853 --> 05:52.331
And I could sit here and toss out a
bunch of great foods to write about,

05:52.365 --> 05:54.395
- but I'm not gonna do that.
- 30 seconds.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.433
Uh, BLT's, tetrazzinis,

05:56.434 --> 05:58.345
fancy cheeses, nougat, hotcakes, lasagna...

05:58.346 --> 06:00.773
- Wait, did you just say... pot cakes?
- No.

06:01.941 --> 06:03.676
Maybe.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.414
- That's a fantastic idea.
- Which is why I said it.

06:09.319 --> 06:11.606
Well pot edibles are so hot right now.

06:11.607 --> 06:12.931
Yeah. Yeah they are.

06:12.932 --> 06:16.100
Everybody's talking about it, then
forgetting what they're talking about. Ha!

06:17.457 --> 06:20.813
Yeah, unfortunately, it ruins the way
food tastes. It's hard to cook with.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.129
Trust me, no one has ever
tasted pot in any of my food.

06:25.365 --> 06:27.502
Okay, get me a killer 500-word piece

06:27.503 --> 06:29.001
about cooking with pot in two days

06:29.035 --> 06:30.597
and I'll run it in this month's issue.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.671
Please, two days? I could
have it for you in one.

06:32.706 --> 06:34.153
- Really?
- No, I'm gonna need two.

06:40.055 --> 06:42.156
Whoever said success
doesn't happen overnight

06:42.191 --> 06:43.958
has never spent the night with me.

06:46.092 --> 06:48.317
Logan wants me to write an
article for her magazine.

06:48.318 --> 06:50.929
Oh my God, and I got a meeting with one

06:50.930 --> 06:52.949
of the managing partners
to talk about a promotion.

06:52.950 --> 06:55.154
That's amazing. Let's celebrate

06:55.155 --> 06:56.974
by buying a big bag of marijuana.

06:59.341 --> 07:00.508
Uh, what?

07:00.542 --> 07:02.476
Oh, my article's about cooking with pot.

07:02.511 --> 07:03.503
- Pot?
- Yeah.

07:03.504 --> 07:05.247
Gabi. Seriously, you've
never cooked with pot.

07:05.248 --> 07:08.654
Yeah, I didn't know how to paint with socks
either, but our bathroom turned out great.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.053
You know what? You're right. Look at us.

07:13.121 --> 07:15.374
We push ourselves and the world opens up.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.162
Oh yeah speaking of pushers, does
Dimebag Dave still live downstairs?

07:19.928 --> 07:22.327
No, he moved. To jail.

07:23.732 --> 07:26.230
Look if you're gonna do
it, at least do it honestly.

07:26.231 --> 07:28.311
Fake an illness and get a cannabis card

07:28.312 --> 07:29.799
like my Nana did.

07:30.806 --> 07:33.668
Well I don't know. I-I'm only
good at lying to people I know.

07:33.669 --> 07:35.661
I mean I'm starting to get
nervous and anxious about this.

07:35.662 --> 07:37.378
That's perfect. Just tell the doctor

07:37.379 --> 07:39.113
you need weed to calm your nerves.

07:40.282 --> 07:41.825
Hey, that's a great idea,

07:41.826 --> 07:43.417
and then I won't be lying.

07:43.452 --> 07:46.294
But since I won't be
lying, I won't be nervous.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.957
So I-I will be lying.

07:50.248 --> 07:51.948
But I also won't be.

07:53.562 --> 07:54.862
Are you stoned already?

08:02.671 --> 08:06.140
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Let me do the talking.

08:06.174 --> 08:08.723
I know what I'm doing.
I'm from the streets.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.345
You grew up in a gated community.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.848
Yeah, but was it keeping people out

08:13.882 --> 08:15.269
or us in, chica?

08:16.218 --> 08:18.753
- Come on, Sofia.
- Shh.

08:18.787 --> 08:20.655
Never say your real name.

08:20.689 --> 08:21.889
Call me Lil So-So.

08:22.924 --> 08:24.364
Sup?

08:24.365 --> 08:26.727
So my homegirl here jacked
up her neck in a drive-by.

08:26.762 --> 08:28.596
Actually, it was a drive-thru.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.147
My kid's meal didn't come with a toy

08:30.148 --> 08:32.600
and I was all "Hell no..."

08:33.769 --> 08:35.778
- Could I see the doctor?
- Sure.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.360
- He'll be with you in a moment.
- Okay.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.296
- Act like you're in pain.
- What?

08:40.297 --> 08:41.409
Ow!

08:43.511 --> 08:46.162
Okay, we'll start by checking your vitals.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.916
Wow, you're a cashier and a doctor.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.018
You're a double threat.
I'm also a notary public,

08:51.053 --> 08:53.559
but enough about me.
Consultation's 200 bucks

08:53.560 --> 08:55.056
and it includes a half-ounce.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.132
Uh, 200 for a half-sack?

08:57.133 --> 08:58.826
That's a straight ripoff, G.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.987
Cut the act, Dora the Explorer.

09:01.418 --> 09:03.237
If you can find a better
price somewhere else,

09:03.238 --> 09:05.416
- hit the road.
- Oh, I can find a better price.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.435
But I don't like to
take the bus after dark.

09:10.472 --> 09:13.374
Elliot, Josh is alone in his office.

09:13.408 --> 09:15.650
It's a perfect time to ask for a raise.

09:15.651 --> 09:17.385
I just got another one.

09:19.114 --> 09:21.015
I can't do that.

09:21.049 --> 09:23.818
What if he yells at me?
I'm already starting to sweat.

09:23.852 --> 09:27.021
Elliot, Josh isn't your daddy.

09:27.055 --> 09:29.235
No matter how many times
you try to sit on his lap.

09:32.928 --> 09:35.248
Hey, Dad... I mean, Josh?

09:37.666 --> 09:39.567
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about something.

09:40.669 --> 09:42.772
Okay, look,

09:42.773 --> 09:44.597
I know when Gabi was talking to Cooper,

09:44.598 --> 09:46.307
I let my feelings bubble up a little bit,

09:46.341 --> 09:47.508
but it's not gonna happen again.

09:47.509 --> 09:49.766
I've just got to focus on being her boss

09:49.767 --> 09:51.212
and being professional.

09:51.752 --> 09:53.557
That's brilliant, Josh.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.951
If I had a glass, I would raise it to you.

09:57.873 --> 09:59.086
Raise.

10:00.055 --> 10:01.689
That's a funny word, huh?

10:03.759 --> 10:05.173
Everything okay, Elliot?

10:06.762 --> 10:09.275
See, I've worked for you for a while,

10:09.276 --> 10:12.093
and um, this place is like a home to me,

10:12.249 --> 10:14.541
except there's no shrine
to Anderson Cooper.

10:17.102 --> 10:18.235
Are you sick?

10:18.875 --> 10:21.082
You're sweating, like, a lot.

10:22.344 --> 10:24.451
Am I? Whoa!

10:25.447 --> 10:28.015
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

10:28.049 --> 10:29.682
Good talk. Gotta go.

10:37.826 --> 10:39.593
Girl, are you cooking with weed?

10:40.619 --> 10:41.929
What is wrong with you?

10:41.963 --> 10:44.213
It's cool, Yolanda. Josh is letting me.

10:44.214 --> 10:45.737
Oh.

10:45.738 --> 10:47.325
Well then fix me up a gin and juice

10:47.326 --> 10:49.463
and let's blow this penthouse party up!

10:49.469 --> 10:50.805
Hey!

10:50.806 --> 10:53.881
I'm making edibles for my article and I
have to turn these in by three o'clock.

10:53.882 --> 10:56.006
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Josh.

10:56.015 --> 10:57.702
Thank you so much for
letting me use the kitchen.

10:57.703 --> 10:59.280
- You're my hero.
- No.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.182
Just your boss

11:01.216 --> 11:03.851
who thinks of you in a completely
professional capacity only.

11:04.986 --> 11:06.761
Oh, I know what's going on.

11:06.762 --> 11:09.286
You-You're worried that I'm gonna
get another job and leave you.

11:09.549 --> 11:14.562
Ha ha, well, ah, if you left, I'd let you
go because I am very good at letting go.

11:15.597 --> 11:17.531
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

11:17.566 --> 11:19.467
I'm not. That would be a
feeling and I don't have those.

11:19.501 --> 11:20.668
Bye-e-e.

11:23.169 --> 11:24.944
Huh! He seems really stressed.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.407
I'm gonna put a few of these aside for him.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.057
Hmmm...

11:28.170 --> 11:29.913
Uh Gabi, don't taste too much of that.

11:29.914 --> 11:32.594
I had a friend get so high, she
had sex with a beanbag chair.

11:34.707 --> 11:36.531
Well don't worry. I'm only
taking tiny tastes, and I

11:36.532 --> 11:39.007
have to make sure it doesn't taste like pot
or Logan's not gonna use it in the article.

11:39.050 --> 11:40.020
Fine.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.450
But don't coming running to me

11:41.451 --> 11:43.344
when normal sex doesn't feel good anymore.

11:49.664 --> 11:51.789
Engaging, funny.

11:51.790 --> 11:54.168
Oh, there's no "w" in "marijuana."

11:55.136 --> 11:57.197
- But I'm impressed.
- Really?

11:57.198 --> 11:58.961
Don't get too excited.
I have to try your food first.

11:58.962 --> 11:59.462
Okay.

12:04.012 --> 12:06.143
Son of a bitch. Are you sure
there's marijuana in this?

12:07.082 --> 12:09.128
Tons. It's like a Seth
Rogan movie in there.

12:09.794 --> 12:11.919
Then congrats, Gabi. You
got your first article.

12:11.953 --> 12:14.338
Oh my God, thank you so much.

12:15.757 --> 12:17.825
Logan, I'm sorry to interrupt.

12:17.859 --> 12:20.694
What? I'm meeting with a
very talented new writer.

12:20.729 --> 12:22.696
We've got a problem.

12:22.731 --> 12:26.467
Trisha just got offered her
own cooking show and quit.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.302
- Get out.
- No, it's true.

12:28.336 --> 12:30.062
No, I'm talking to you. Get out.

12:32.073 --> 12:35.109
That pear-shaped bitch was making
six figures working part time.

12:35.143 --> 12:38.312
Where the hell am I gonna find another
food editor on such short notice?

12:39.314 --> 12:41.715
Did you say six figures or stick figures?

12:43.985 --> 12:45.953
Hey. Crazy idea.

12:45.987 --> 12:48.889
Gabi, you wouldn't have any interest
in being our food editor, would you?

12:48.890 --> 12:51.659
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

12:51.693 --> 12:53.527
I think you're the modern
voice of food today.

12:53.562 --> 12:55.627
And so much prettier than that cow Trisha.

12:57.114 --> 12:59.366
Oh my God, Logan, thank you so much.

12:59.401 --> 13:00.861
This would be my dream job.

13:00.862 --> 13:02.269
The answer is yes!

13:02.304 --> 13:04.138
Yes, yes, yes,

13:04.172 --> 13:05.472
Gabi.

13:06.134 --> 13:07.975
Wake up.

13:09.377 --> 13:10.945
Josh?

13:12.147 --> 13:14.125
I think you sampled too
many of your recipes.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.916
You passed out hard.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.147
So I'm not the Food Editor of
San Francisco Monthly?

13:21.690 --> 13:22.790
No.

13:24.626 --> 13:27.461
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

13:27.495 --> 13:30.131
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God. I have to get these in by three o'clock

13:30.132 --> 13:31.550
and it's totally dark outside.

13:31.551 --> 13:33.267
Tell me there's a solar eclipse!

13:36.304 --> 13:38.297
- It's 9:00 pm.
- No!

13:39.066 --> 13:42.441
Oh, I missed my deadline
'cause I was stoned!

13:42.745 --> 13:44.348
This stuff should be illegal.

13:49.643 --> 13:52.345
Guess who's back to
being a 23-year-old loser?

13:52.379 --> 13:54.380
Well, not me, so it must be you.

13:55.616 --> 13:56.952
Hey, that's mean.

13:56.953 --> 13:58.740
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:58.741 --> 14:00.190
Success has changed me.

14:01.488 --> 14:03.256
Come on, tell me everything.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.702
Well, I got stoned off my own food,

14:05.703 --> 14:08.052
fell asleep in a pile of
laundry and missed my deadline

14:08.053 --> 14:09.509
and now Logan won't even see me!

14:09.510 --> 14:11.664
I mean, at least I'm a success at failing.

14:12.407 --> 14:15.109
Look at you finding the silver lining.

14:16.662 --> 14:19.806
Positive attitude. That's
Chapter V of Mr. Stubner's book.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.741
I am also rewatching his TED Talk

14:21.775 --> 14:23.583
and following his dog on Twitter.

14:23.584 --> 14:25.478
I am gonna nail this interview tomorrow.

14:25.512 --> 14:27.074
I don't even want to see these anymore.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no,
no. We put a lot of money into these.

14:30.013 --> 14:32.552
Chapter VIII... never waste inventory.

14:32.586 --> 14:34.027
Let me see if these are any good.

14:34.028 --> 14:36.122
Wait. Hold on. They're really strong.

14:36.836 --> 14:38.036
Bitch, please.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.794
You think Lil So-So's
afraid of a little chronic?

14:44.453 --> 14:46.966
Oh my God. Gabi, these are delicious.

14:48.035 --> 14:49.902
I just had a great idea.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.704
Oh my God, these are amazing.

14:51.738 --> 14:53.673
They make me wish I wasn't already stoned.

14:53.707 --> 14:55.797
Yeah, they're that good.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.212
And they're small, so you won't
be full when you get the munchies.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.380
So what do you think?

15:01.415 --> 15:02.916
I'll give you five bucks a piece.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.184
- Ten.
- Eight and I'll throw in a dolphin bong.

15:06.117 --> 15:08.386
Nine. Make it two vaporizers

15:08.387 --> 15:10.990
and I'm gonna need a copy
of my passport notarized.

15:12.322 --> 15:13.953
You drive a hard bargain, but deal.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.447
Can you get me 100 by next week?

15:15.497 --> 15:16.334
A hundred?

15:16.730 --> 15:18.613
At $9 a piece.

15:18.632 --> 15:20.882
That's $9,000.

15:22.525 --> 15:24.670
Yes. Yes, it is.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.120
- Miss Rodriguez?
- Mr. Stubner.

15:28.214 --> 15:29.709
What are you doing here?

15:29.743 --> 15:31.487
What am I doing here? Oh my God.

15:31.488 --> 15:33.513
This is not where I read to the blind.

15:35.043 --> 15:38.351
Sofia, we both know my job is stressful.

15:38.385 --> 15:41.120
What do you think I do during
all those bathroom breaks?

15:41.154 --> 15:42.855
I thought you had I.B.S.

15:43.721 --> 15:45.452
Mini quiche, Mr. Stubner?

15:45.453 --> 15:47.760
Oh, oh, I don't mind if I do.

15:48.359 --> 15:48.859
Mmm...

15:49.646 --> 15:51.898
Very impressive negotiation, by the way.

15:51.932 --> 15:53.766
Really? Thank you.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.868
You were direct and no nonsense.

15:55.903 --> 15:57.253
We admire that at the firm.

15:57.254 --> 15:58.278
You know what?

15:58.440 --> 16:01.374
You don't need to interview.
The promotion is yours.

16:01.408 --> 16:03.609
Oh my God. Th-Thank you!

16:03.644 --> 16:05.585
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

16:05.586 --> 16:08.381
Sofia. Sofia, wake up!

16:08.415 --> 16:11.183
I won't let you down, Mr. Stubner.

16:11.218 --> 16:13.419
What? Wake up. You fell asleep.

16:13.453 --> 16:15.321
What? I did?

16:15.355 --> 16:17.023
Oh.

16:17.057 --> 16:19.792
So I'm not Mr. Stubner's
new Junior Vice President?

16:21.109 --> 16:22.076
No.

16:23.931 --> 16:25.064
What time is it?

16:25.098 --> 16:27.700
10:00 am.

16:27.734 --> 16:30.141
Oh my God, I slept through my
interview! Why didn't you wake me up?

16:30.142 --> 16:32.141
Because I'm irresponsible!
It's kind of my thing!

16:33.420 --> 16:35.421
Mr. Stubner has an
entire chapter in his book

16:35.422 --> 16:37.256
about the importance of being punctual.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.058
He'll never promote me now.

16:39.059 --> 16:42.325
Oh God. I'm a 23-year-old loser again.

16:42.821 --> 16:44.814
Yeah well, welcome back.

16:44.815 --> 16:48.810
The, ah, plastic silverware and
stolen ketchup packets have missed you.

16:49.871 --> 16:53.025
Well, at least we still have jobs.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.961
Yeah.

16:54.995 --> 16:57.638
Unless we get fired for
being totally late! Come on!

17:03.596 --> 17:05.396
I did it!

17:05.714 --> 17:08.540
I finally came up with
a way to ask for a raise.

17:08.575 --> 17:10.710
I made a recording on my phone

17:10.743 --> 17:13.646
of me asking for one in
a calm confident voice.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.664
That I'm going to lip sync
to when I meet with Josh.

17:18.032 --> 17:20.118
Is your bow tie on too tight?

17:22.069 --> 17:24.390
You just watch.

17:24.424 --> 17:26.655
Josh, it's me...

17:26.656 --> 17:28.556
Elliot, your hardworking,

17:28.557 --> 17:30.796
competent and favorite employee.

17:30.797 --> 17:32.798
Of many years.

17:32.799 --> 17:34.466
Fluffykins, no!

17:34.467 --> 17:36.435
I'll edit that out.

17:36.459 --> 17:38.327
So in summation,

17:38.361 --> 17:40.562
I would really appreciate
an increase in salary,

17:40.597 --> 17:43.384
more commonly known as a raise.

17:45.268 --> 17:47.336
So what do you think?

17:47.433 --> 17:50.376
That was the worst kung
fu movie I've ever seen.

17:53.309 --> 17:56.011
- Hey, is lunch ready?
- Sure is!

17:57.113 --> 17:58.914
Ta-da!

17:58.948 --> 18:00.716
What's all this?

18:00.750 --> 18:02.618
It's a special lunch that I made for you.

18:02.652 --> 18:03.986
Not a lot of bosses
will let their employees

18:04.020 --> 18:05.988
take a five-hour nap on
the laundry room floor.

18:06.022 --> 18:08.557
Yup. Not a lot of employees would do that.

18:09.793 --> 18:11.693
Listen, ah, can I ask you something?

18:13.696 --> 18:16.331
- Is it personal?
- No, it's completely work-related.

18:16.366 --> 18:18.418
- Ask away.
- Okay.

18:21.571 --> 18:25.471
So have you ever been so close to
getting something that you really wanted

18:25.496 --> 18:28.446
and then it just slipped
through your fingers?

18:29.946 --> 18:31.533
What I'm asking is, you know,

18:31.534 --> 18:33.183
how do you deal with failure?

18:34.577 --> 18:36.645
Well, first of all,

18:36.686 --> 18:38.520
- it sucks.
- Right?

18:38.555 --> 18:40.321
Yeah, you feel horrible.

18:40.322 --> 18:41.890
And you try to stop thinking about it,

18:41.925 --> 18:44.389
but you keep playing it over
in your head over and over,

18:44.390 --> 18:45.775
and then your friends start pitying you,

18:45.776 --> 18:47.463
so what do you do? You have
to tell them you've moved on.

18:47.497 --> 18:48.730
But how do you get past it?

18:48.765 --> 18:52.201
I don't-I don't know.
Just pretend you're fine.

18:53.403 --> 18:55.270
It buys you time until
hopefully you realize that...

18:57.036 --> 18:58.628
Everything happens for a reason

19:00.514 --> 19:03.846
and maybe things didn't work out because
there's something better out there for you.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.815
Something better than cooking with drugs?

19:08.852 --> 19:10.118
I think you're right.

19:10.153 --> 19:12.735
Thanks, Josh. You're a really good friend.

19:12.736 --> 19:13.289
Boss.

19:13.990 --> 19:15.824
- Friend-boss.
- Boss-friend.

19:21.191 --> 19:24.114
So what's this important thing
you needed to talk to me about?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.964
_

19:30.089 --> 19:32.446
_

19:32.490 --> 19:34.502
_

19:34.721 --> 19:36.459
_

19:36.995 --> 19:39.096
Is this why you've been acting so weird?

19:39.141 --> 19:39.641
_

19:43.389 --> 19:45.410
Okay, so how much were you thinking?

19:46.715 --> 19:48.871
_

19:49.262 --> 19:51.219
_

19:54.182 --> 19:55.587
Okay, Elliot, sure.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.031
_

19:59.131 --> 20:01.393
See? That wasn't difficult, was it?

20:01.427 --> 20:03.462
I want you to know you can
come to me for anything.

20:03.496 --> 20:05.564
- Thanks, Josh.
- You're welcome.

20:05.598 --> 20:08.333
And since this was your
first time asking for a raise,

20:08.367 --> 20:10.268
anything else I can do for you?

20:11.224 --> 20:13.305
I don't know. How about
you take your shirt off?

20:13.339 --> 20:15.340
- Elliot.
- Sorry.

20:15.374 --> 20:17.275
You know what?

20:17.310 --> 20:19.244
After all you've done,

20:19.509 --> 20:20.612
I'll do it.

20:26.586 --> 20:30.003
More, more, more!

20:32.512 --> 20:35.837
- Elliot, wake up. You fell asleep!
- What?

20:36.480 --> 20:39.498
So Josh didn't take his
clothes off and dance for me?

20:40.633 --> 20:42.334
No.

20:43.693 --> 20:45.798
And you still make more money than me?

20:46.503 --> 20:47.924
Yeah!
