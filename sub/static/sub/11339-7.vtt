00:12.775 --> 00:14.555
Better run there, Meredith!

00:16.139 --> 00:18.874
Whoo-hoo!

00:25.700 --> 00:27.968
You can run faster
than that, girl!

00:31.873 --> 00:34.375
Aah!

00:39.714 --> 00:41.415
Whoo-hoo!

00:47.305 --> 00:48.588
Meredith?

00:48.640 --> 00:51.591
Where'd you go, baby?

00:51.643 --> 00:54.278
Meredith?

00:54.362 --> 00:56.630
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

00:56.698 --> 00:58.282
Meredith?

01:00.969 --> 01:02.836
Fan out.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.754
Meredith...

01:43.328 --> 01:45.696
Meredith?

02:00.044 --> 02:00.994
Hah!

02:01.045 --> 02:02.996
Found her!
Aah!

02:03.064 --> 02:05.466
No! Please...

02:06.634 --> 02:07.551
Please...

02:07.635 --> 02:09.103
Shh...Shh...

02:10.104 --> 02:12.806
It's all right.

02:13.808 --> 02:15.776
Let me know
when you're finished.

02:20.615 --> 02:21.865
No!

02:21.950 --> 02:23.450
No!

02:24.579 --> 02:25.662
Whoa.

02:25.747 --> 02:27.914
Welcome to the 21st century.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.499
Yay, technology.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.836
Behold. Everyone has
a new tablet.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.320
We've gone paperless?

02:34.372 --> 02:36.173
Fear not,
doctor of the dark ages.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.625
I went old school for your
anti-technology quirk.

02:38.693 --> 02:41.995
Paper files,
hard copy photos.

02:42.063 --> 02:44.798
But the abacus
is your responsibility.

02:44.866 --> 02:46.366
Garcia, not that I don't
appreciate your efforts,

02:46.434 --> 02:48.902
but exactly where did
the funding for these come from?

02:48.970 --> 02:50.837
I did a thing.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.139
A thing?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.474
Best not talk about
the thing.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.209
We'll talk about
the thing later.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.195
Ok. Instead, let's talk
about harvest season.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.547
Because it is harvest season
in Indiana,

03:00.615 --> 03:03.884
and farmers are finding
more than corn in their fields.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.886
Meredith Joy, Kimberly Jukes,
and Amanda Frye

03:05.953 --> 03:08.688
were all discovered murdered
in Johnson County, Indiana.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.990
All 3 women
were exotic dancers

03:10.057 --> 03:11.491
living in different
counties in the state.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.759
Kimberly Jukes,
the first victim,

03:12.827 --> 03:14.244
went missing 6 weeks ago.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.246
And in each instance,
the women finished their shifts,

03:16.330 --> 03:17.747
but they never made it
to their cars.

03:17.832 --> 03:19.833
It says here Amanda Frye was
found 90 miles from her house.

03:19.901 --> 03:21.868
This guy's going a long way
to abduct his victims.

03:21.919 --> 03:23.370
If he's dumping the bodies
in the same county,

03:23.437 --> 03:25.038
it's a good chance
he's located nearby.

03:25.089 --> 03:27.340
It shouldn't be too hard to
work up a geographical profile.

03:27.391 --> 03:28.558
Meredith Joy put up
quite a fight.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.011
She's got defensive wounds
all over her body.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.847
And the lab discovered two different
samples of DNA under her fingernails,

03:33.898 --> 03:35.348
so we're dealing with
at least a team.

03:35.416 --> 03:39.019
One that rapes, beats, and strangles
their victims in a cornfield.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.721
They're using condoms.
I bet one of these guys has a record

03:41.772 --> 03:43.240
and he doesn't want us
connecting the DNA.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.225
And they're accelerating
their attack schedule.

03:45.276 --> 03:46.726
It's 3 weeks between the
first and second kill,

03:46.794 --> 03:48.962
2 weeks between
the second and third.

03:49.030 --> 03:51.731
Meredith Joy
died October 31st.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.699
Now they're down to one week.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.700
Who's missing?

03:53.768 --> 03:54.784
Her name
is Stephanie Wilson.

03:54.869 --> 03:56.436
She was abducted last night
from Club Prowl

03:56.504 --> 03:57.621
in Tippecanoe county.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.072
She finished her shift
at midnight,

03:59.123 --> 04:00.941
but she never made it home
to her 2-year-old daughter.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.475
Babysitter called the police,

04:02.543 --> 04:04.611
and Stephanie's car was left in
the parking lot like the others.

04:04.679 --> 04:05.812
And there's
a clear pattern.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.647
All the women have been
abducted on Friday night

04:07.715 --> 04:09.216
and murdered sometime
Sunday evening.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.952
Which means we've got less than 2
days to save Stephanie Wilson.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.822
Stephanie.

04:16.891 --> 04:19.108
Hey, wake up, sweetheart.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.996
Hey, come on, sleepyhead.

04:23.064 --> 04:25.982
You gotta get back
to work now.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.651
That's a girl.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.986
Come on, now.

04:30.071 --> 04:32.656
Rise and shine.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.008
Hey, no sleeping in.
It's time to get back to work.

04:35.076 --> 04:36.877
Hey! Shh, shh.
Hey, don't you struggle.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.328
Hey, don't struggle.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.663
Don't struggle.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.048
You know better than that,
don't you?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.801
Yeah, you do. Yeah.

04:44.886 --> 04:46.820
All right.

04:46.888 --> 04:49.139
Batter up.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.725
Whoo!
Yes, sir.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.063
Oh! God, what the hell, man!

04:57.131 --> 05:00.367
Wake up. You don't
want to miss the show.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.471
Here. Take this.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.669
No, no.

05:19.754 --> 05:20.670
No...

05:20.755 --> 05:22.289
No...

05:22.340 --> 05:23.506
No.

Napoleon Bonaparte.

06:33.701 --> 06:35.368
Hey, guys.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.637
Look at the patterns
on the cornfields.

06:37.705 --> 06:39.506
It's all hard turns
and zigzags.

06:39.574 --> 06:40.941
They had to have been
chasing these women.

06:41.008 --> 06:42.509
Do you think
they escaped?

06:42.577 --> 06:44.811
Maybe if it was just
the one time, but all 3?

06:44.879 --> 06:46.680
They let them go so they
could chase them again.

06:46.747 --> 06:49.282
The women probably thought
they were being released.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.084
I'd say we're most likely looking
for two dominant Alpha male

06:51.152 --> 06:52.385
personalities,
but we shouldn't rule out

06:52.453 --> 06:53.620
one dominant who allows
his submissive

06:53.671 --> 06:56.139
to have sex with these victims
in order to control him.

06:56.224 --> 06:58.141
Well, it certainly speaks
speaks to their arrogance

06:58.226 --> 07:00.160
if they're that confident
the women won't get away.

07:00.228 --> 07:03.163
Prostitutes and strippers
usually make easy targets.

07:03.231 --> 07:05.332
Maybe they need
to up the challenge.

07:05.399 --> 07:06.867
The hunt could be
what gets them off.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.835
Garcia, focus on
prior sexual crimes

07:08.903 --> 07:10.370
in the area.

07:10.438 --> 07:12.339
This kind of confidence
doesn't get built overnight.

07:12.406 --> 07:14.641
Yeah, I am compiling
as we are face-timing.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.377
I'm also running DNA results
through unsolved crimes

07:17.445 --> 07:18.879
in Indiana
and the surrounding states.

07:18.946 --> 07:20.614
Good. Let me know as soon
as you find anything.

07:20.681 --> 07:22.215
You know, interestingly,
all 3 victims

07:22.283 --> 07:24.050
had downers and uppers
in their system.

07:24.118 --> 07:26.319
Well, were the drugs
used to subdue the women,

07:26.370 --> 07:28.455
or is it a ruse to get them
to come home with them?

07:28.523 --> 07:29.789
Prentiss and reid,
go to the club

07:29.857 --> 07:31.191
where Stephanie Wilson
worked to find out.

07:31.259 --> 07:33.059
Dave, you and Morgan
work the dumpsite,

07:33.127 --> 07:35.395
and I'll work victimology at
the local Sheriff's station.

07:35.463 --> 07:37.864
You think you can give me
the runaround, kemp?

07:37.932 --> 07:39.516
I don't think so.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.935
No one talks to the press
but me.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.937
This is my department,
my investigation.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.605
Do you understand?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.274
You make me look bad.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.909
It's not enough
I got the FBI coming in.

07:48.976 --> 07:51.811
No, now I have to deal with
fumbled plays from my own team?

07:51.879 --> 07:53.713
Desk duty, 2 weeks.

07:53.781 --> 07:55.649
Dismissed.

08:02.957 --> 08:04.040
Sheriff.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.325
Sheriff Jeff Salters.

08:05.376 --> 08:06.409
Aaron Hotchner.

08:06.494 --> 08:07.427
Sorry about that.

08:07.495 --> 08:08.762
One of my guys
leaked the news

08:08.829 --> 08:10.163
about the dead woman
to the press.

08:10.214 --> 08:12.032
I needed to, uh,
send a message.

08:12.099 --> 08:14.601
Why is the investigation
being kept a secret?

08:14.669 --> 08:15.835
Well, that was my call.

08:15.903 --> 08:17.337
I don't want these guys
skipping town

08:17.405 --> 08:19.806
before I have a chance
to arrest them.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.775
This ends
in my jurisdiction.

08:21.842 --> 08:25.512
Has Stephanie Wilson's
father arrived?

08:25.580 --> 08:28.014
He's waiting
in the conference room.

08:28.082 --> 08:29.783
He's pretty messed up
about the whole thing.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.785
That's understandable.

08:31.852 --> 08:33.119
I just don't get it.

08:33.187 --> 08:35.422
You know how many strippers
and prostitutes

08:35.523 --> 08:39.025
I saw get beaten up and raped
when I worked the city?

08:39.092 --> 08:41.962
Sometimes it's like
they're asking for it.

08:42.029 --> 08:45.031
Nobody asks for this,
Sheriff.

08:45.099 --> 08:47.133
Not consciously, anyway.

08:47.201 --> 08:48.368
Shall we go in?

08:48.436 --> 08:50.070
I think I'll speak
to him alone.

08:51.439 --> 08:52.622
Look...

08:52.707 --> 08:55.242
I call it like I see it.

08:55.309 --> 08:57.344
These women are victims
of heinous crimes.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.812
I won't have you
judging them

08:58.879 --> 09:00.280
in front of their families.

09:00.348 --> 09:02.782
And I won't have you telling me
how to run my show.

09:02.850 --> 09:04.651
The governor may have
requested your help,

09:04.719 --> 09:05.986
but this is my case.

09:06.053 --> 09:07.320
It's not a show.

09:07.388 --> 09:08.471
It is your case.

09:08.556 --> 09:10.223
And you can watch
from the outside.

09:13.394 --> 09:14.828
That had to hurt.

09:14.895 --> 09:17.347
Let's just hope he can take care
of business again tomorrow.

09:17.415 --> 09:19.032
Are you suddenly a doubter?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.700
'Cause there's the door, man.

09:26.841 --> 09:29.175
Are you seeing this?

09:32.380 --> 09:33.980
...Live at schmidt farm,

09:34.048 --> 09:37.517
where the body of Meredith Joy
was discovered late last week,

09:37.585 --> 09:40.186
making her the third victim
in recent weeks

09:40.254 --> 09:43.290
to turn up dead
in a cornfield.

09:43.357 --> 09:45.925
The Johnson county Sheriff's
department remains quiet

09:45.993 --> 09:48.144
about their investigation
thus far,

09:48.229 --> 09:50.680
but we'll stay on
the scene as this story...

09:50.765 --> 09:52.198
What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed

09:52.266 --> 09:53.800
not to come
to each other's work.

09:53.868 --> 09:55.502
What did you get me into?

09:55.569 --> 09:57.003
Me? I didn't know anything
about this.

09:57.071 --> 09:58.338
Those girls are dead, Chris.

09:58.406 --> 10:00.807
Chase them around,
have some fun with them,

10:00.858 --> 10:02.876
they won't remember a thing.
That's what you told me.

10:02.943 --> 10:05.679
Scott, that's how it was.

10:05.746 --> 10:07.614
You really didn't know?

10:11.252 --> 10:13.153
Where's Michael?

10:13.220 --> 10:16.089
I'll meet you out back
in 10 minutes.

10:21.095 --> 10:24.731
She said she was making extra
money waiting tables at a bar.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.883
She's my little girl.
I didn't question it.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.302
God, this is all my fault.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.137
No one could have foreseen
Stephanie's abduction.

10:31.205 --> 10:32.706
It's not your fault.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.808
I know, I know.
I just, I--I can't--

10:40.781 --> 10:42.849
Amy needs her mother.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.751
What are you doing
to try to find her?

10:44.819 --> 10:46.720
We're helping local law enforcement
by building a profile.

10:46.787 --> 10:50.156
Profile? Why aren't you just
out there looking for her?

10:50.224 --> 10:53.159
Who knows what these--
these men are doing to her.

10:53.227 --> 10:54.861
I need you to find
my daughter.

10:54.929 --> 10:57.731
We are looking for her. Hopefully this
will point us in the right direction.

10:57.798 --> 10:59.566
No, no,
that's not good enough.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.305
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.707
I just, um,

11:07.775 --> 11:09.376
this has all just been
too much.

11:09.443 --> 11:10.944
It's all right.

11:11.011 --> 11:13.713
Mr. Wilson, I assure you,
we will not stop

11:13.781 --> 11:15.482
until we find Stephanie.

11:25.776 --> 11:28.595
What would it take for you
or one of your co-workers

11:28.662 --> 11:30.897
to go home with a customer?

11:30.948 --> 11:33.750
Nothing.
I have a boyfriend.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.135
Does he know
that you work here?

11:35.202 --> 11:36.903
It's how we met.

11:36.954 --> 11:39.239
He doesn't have a problem with it.
Do you?

11:39.306 --> 11:41.741
No, not at all. I'm from Las Vegas.
I don't have a problem with it.

11:41.809 --> 11:44.244
I just, um, these are questions
that we have to ask.

11:44.311 --> 11:45.478
We are not judging you.

11:45.546 --> 11:47.947
We're just trying
to find Stephanie.

11:48.015 --> 11:49.816
Now, you said
you met your boyfriend here.

11:49.884 --> 11:52.619
So you did go home
with a customer once before.

11:52.686 --> 11:54.721
Those were the early days.

11:54.772 --> 11:57.757
Everyone's a little wild
in the beginning.

11:57.808 --> 11:58.892
Not the veterans?

11:58.959 --> 12:01.261
We know
to play it safe.

12:01.328 --> 12:04.697
Was Stephanie the type of girl
who played it safe?

12:04.765 --> 12:07.934
She never really went
through a wild phase.

12:08.002 --> 12:10.770
All she cared about was
getting home to her daughter.

12:10.838 --> 12:13.456
Did anyone try and take
her home last night?

12:13.541 --> 12:15.208
Everyone tries.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.342
Every night.

12:16.410 --> 12:17.627
Nothing stood out?

12:17.711 --> 12:19.913
I know she got asked
to go to a party.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.582
We all did. But she
turned them down.

12:22.650 --> 12:23.917
Them plural?

12:23.984 --> 12:25.351
There were
these two guys.

12:25.419 --> 12:27.353
They got dances
from each of us.

12:27.421 --> 12:28.888
What kind of party
were they offering?

12:28.956 --> 12:30.857
I never got a chance
to find out.

12:30.925 --> 12:33.309
It's bad business to discuss
private deals on the floor.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.812
Can you show me where you and
Stephanie gave them their dances?

12:35.896 --> 12:37.564
Yeah. Over here.

12:40.601 --> 12:42.068
I was in here

12:42.135 --> 12:43.770
while Stephanie
was in that one.

12:45.606 --> 12:46.539
Ok.

12:46.607 --> 12:47.874
Could you sit down?

12:47.942 --> 12:49.709
Yeah.

12:49.777 --> 12:51.878
All right, I can see
the whole room,

12:51.946 --> 12:53.546
but I can't see
my partner.

12:53.614 --> 12:55.014
If you're working
as a team,

12:55.082 --> 12:57.851
you both want to see the
girl you're gonna take home.

12:57.918 --> 13:01.087
Why would they do it somewhere
where they can't see each other?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.689
We should take a look at the
club surveillance footage.

13:02.756 --> 13:04.507
Only 2 cameras. There's
a lot of blind spots.

13:04.592 --> 13:06.009
How do you keep an eye
on all the girls?

13:06.093 --> 13:07.343
We got the one guy
in the back,

13:07.428 --> 13:09.012
one guy on the floor
at all times.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.363
It looks pretty full.

13:10.431 --> 13:11.831
Are you always this busy
on the weekends?

13:11.932 --> 13:13.433
Only on theme nights.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.035
The unsubs probably picked crowded
nights to make sure they blend in.

13:16.103 --> 13:17.604
Well, they're smart.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.039
They make a plan of attack
before they get to the club,

13:20.107 --> 13:22.175
then they separate
and choose their prey.

13:22.243 --> 13:24.711
I doubt they were very happy
when Stephanie turned them down.

13:24.778 --> 13:26.346
Alpha personalities
don't handle rejection well.

13:26.413 --> 13:29.282
They abducted her from the parking
lot just like the others.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.884
It didn't matter what she said.

13:30.951 --> 13:34.554
Stephanie was going to that party
whether she wanted to or not.

13:37.408 --> 13:39.526
How the hell
did they find this place?

13:39.593 --> 13:42.212
We must have taken 30
different turns to get here.

13:42.296 --> 13:43.563
Thank you, Deputy.

13:43.631 --> 13:45.915
We're definitely
looking for a local.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.051
We should position
black-and-whites in the area.

13:48.135 --> 13:50.403
We might be able to spot the
unsubs before their next hunt.

13:50.471 --> 13:53.072
Garcia should pull surveillance
footage of gas stations, too.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.390
With all this driving,

13:54.475 --> 13:57.010
they have to be getting
their fuel somewhere.

13:57.077 --> 13:58.745
I don't get it.

13:58.812 --> 13:59.846
What?

13:59.914 --> 14:01.347
These guys enjoy
the thrill of the chase.

14:01.398 --> 14:02.715
I mean, all right,
I'll buy that.

14:02.783 --> 14:05.118
But what I don't buy is them
taking such a big risk.

14:05.185 --> 14:06.686
Well, they wouldn't
let their victim loose

14:06.754 --> 14:09.188
unless they were certain
she couldn't get away.

14:09.256 --> 14:11.357
So what would make them
so certain?

14:11.425 --> 14:12.959
Manpower.

14:14.762 --> 14:16.863
It would take one person
to drive the truck.

14:16.931 --> 14:20.366
It would take another guy to handle the
spotlight to track her in the field.

14:20.434 --> 14:21.534
Is that enough?

14:21.602 --> 14:23.336
Not for me. I mean,
come on, look at this place.

14:23.403 --> 14:26.706
How can two guys guarantee
that she's not gonna get away?

14:26.774 --> 14:27.874
They drug her.

14:27.942 --> 14:30.076
Maybe they think
that's enough.

14:32.513 --> 14:34.647
Or we're dealing with
more than two unsubs.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.224
Hey, fellas.

14:45.276 --> 14:47.443
Who's tagging in?

14:47.528 --> 14:49.812
Did you really kill
those girls?

14:52.432 --> 14:54.400
I was protecting us.

14:56.403 --> 14:59.005
You protected us so well,
the FBI's here.

14:59.073 --> 15:00.006
What?

15:00.074 --> 15:01.140
They got here this morning.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.544
What do we do,
drug her and dump her?

15:04.612 --> 15:06.963
I don't want
any part of this.

15:07.047 --> 15:08.314
Too late.

15:08.382 --> 15:10.817
You're in just as deep
as the rest of us.

15:10.884 --> 15:12.669
We only had sex with them.
We didn't kill anyone.

15:12.753 --> 15:15.355
First of all, a jury's
not gonna call it sex.

15:15.422 --> 15:16.689
They're gonna call it
rape.

15:16.757 --> 15:18.891
Second of all, I told you
I'd take care of it.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.560
What did you think I meant?

15:20.628 --> 15:23.296
I don't know. That--
that you'd drug them

15:23.364 --> 15:25.231
to make them forget us
or something.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.799
Then let them go,
not this.

15:26.850 --> 15:29.369
If we'd have let them go, we'd
all be in jail right now.

15:29.436 --> 15:32.171
Like it or not, we're safe
'cause of what I did.

15:32.239 --> 15:35.875
None of that matters right now.
The FBI are after us.

15:35.943 --> 15:38.111
What do we do?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.684
So what
if the Feds are here?

15:44.752 --> 15:46.886
We covered our tracks.

15:46.954 --> 15:50.556
They can't connect
the girls to us.

15:50.624 --> 15:52.859
We still got
our whole weekend.

15:52.926 --> 15:55.494
I say we lay low,

15:55.546 --> 15:57.730
enjoy ourselves.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.835
Party ain't over yet, baby.

16:10.244 --> 16:11.711
We know these guys are local,

16:11.779 --> 16:14.180
so we should be looking for anybody
working fields or agriculture.

16:14.231 --> 16:17.016
Only problem is, more than
half of Indiana is farmland.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.919
Garcia, were either of the other
clubs having theme nights

16:19.987 --> 16:21.387
when the girls went missing?

16:21.455 --> 16:23.056
Oh, my gosh.

16:23.123 --> 16:24.257
All of them.

16:24.324 --> 16:26.075
Meredith Joy was abducted
on Dollar Draft night,

16:26.160 --> 16:28.227
Amanda Frye on Ladies night,

16:28.295 --> 16:30.063
and Kimberly Jukes on
Fantasy Football Friday.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.531
So, reid, you were right.
They're targeting nights

16:31.598 --> 16:33.366
that the clubs
were at capacity

16:33.434 --> 16:36.135
so they won't be easily recognized
by the security cameras.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.370
Reid.

16:37.438 --> 16:38.604
Guys, I think I found
our two unsubs.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.039
These guys have gotten dances

16:40.090 --> 16:41.708
from half the girls in the club.

16:41.775 --> 16:43.926
They're very careful to hide
their faces from the cameras.

16:44.011 --> 16:47.213
And this guy seems to be communicating
with someone across the room.

16:47.281 --> 16:48.815
But if his partner's sitting
in the booth next to him,

16:48.882 --> 16:50.016
who's he talking to?

16:50.084 --> 16:51.317
Garcia, do you
have another angle?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.753
No luck, head Hotch-o, the
other camera faces the door.

16:53.821 --> 16:56.622
If there's a third unsub, we
could be looking at a pack.

16:56.690 --> 16:59.492
That makes sense.
If these two in the booths are underlings,

16:59.560 --> 17:02.295
they would look to the pack
leader to choose the target.

17:02.362 --> 17:04.597
That's why they abduct the women
from the parking lot.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.365
Stephanie only knew about
the first two men.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.267
If there was a third, she never
would have seen them coming.

17:08.335 --> 17:10.086
Garcia, any luck
with the DNA database?

17:10.170 --> 17:11.671
Nothing
in a 5-state radius,

17:11.739 --> 17:14.339
but I am opening
my parameters to nationwide.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.842
That is gonna take
some time, though.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.175
That's the one thing
we don't have.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.679
We have 24 hours before
Stephanie Wilson ends up

17:19.747 --> 17:20.680
in a cornfield.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.981
We might even have
less than that.

17:22.049 --> 17:23.249
What do you mean?

17:23.317 --> 17:25.017
Two unsubs working toward a
common goal is one thing.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.385
Add a third
and all bets are off.

17:26.453 --> 17:27.854
We only found
two traces of DNA.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.156
One of them probably
doesn't know about the murders.

17:30.224 --> 17:31.691
The pack hierarchy
will start to break down.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.025
They'll question their leader.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.527
And when that happens,
the Alpha

17:34.595 --> 17:36.162
will have to reassert
his authority,

17:36.230 --> 17:38.481
and Stephanie Wilson will be
the object of his aggression.

17:38.565 --> 17:40.149
You should have told me.

17:40.234 --> 17:43.069
After all we've been through, I
don't get why you'd lie to me.

17:43.137 --> 17:44.637
I'm worried
about Scotty.

17:44.705 --> 17:47.607
You know him best.
You think he'll run to the Sheriff?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.877
No. He's been with us
on two hunts now.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.079
He knows he'll get locked up
if he talks.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.214
He'll stay loyal.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.083
Let's hope so.

17:57.151 --> 17:58.384
Ohh!

17:58.452 --> 18:00.753
No, no, no!

18:04.725 --> 18:06.926
You're gonna have to do a hell
of a lot better than that, girl,

18:06.994 --> 18:08.461
or we're gonna have
a real problem.

18:08.529 --> 18:10.363
What are you doing?!

18:12.166 --> 18:13.816
God!

18:13.901 --> 18:15.768
Aah! No!

18:15.819 --> 18:18.354
Now dance!

18:44.742 --> 18:45.948
Who--who's there?

18:46.048 --> 18:47.832
Hey.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.051
I brought you some breakfast.

18:55.925 --> 18:57.943
I'm not hungry.

18:58.010 --> 19:02.097
Look, if you eat,
I'll take off the blindfold.

19:02.164 --> 19:05.183
But you have to promise not to look at me.
Can you do that?

19:06.552 --> 19:07.953
Ok.

19:12.858 --> 19:14.626
It's--it's ok.

19:14.694 --> 19:16.728
Just keep your eyes closed.

19:24.603 --> 19:26.938
You can open them now.

19:34.714 --> 19:37.349
You're going to kill me,
aren't you?

19:37.416 --> 19:39.100
No.

19:39.185 --> 19:41.653
No, it's just...

19:41.721 --> 19:43.021
I don't know.

19:43.089 --> 19:45.056
Please let me go.

19:45.107 --> 19:47.025
I can't do that.

19:48.227 --> 19:50.028
I don't want to die.

19:50.096 --> 19:51.796
I don't want that either.

19:51.864 --> 19:53.298
Then let me go.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.633
I have a daughter.
She's only 2.

19:55.701 --> 19:57.235
Please.

19:57.303 --> 20:00.538
I want to see my baby.

20:05.795 --> 20:09.114
I'm going to do everything I can
to get you back to her.

20:09.181 --> 20:10.749
I promise.

20:11.984 --> 20:14.836
You shouldn't make a promise
you can't keep.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.654
I was just saying that
to get her to eat, ok?

20:16.722 --> 20:19.007
We need her to last, don't we?

20:19.091 --> 20:21.693
Whoops, this must have
fell off.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.628
There we go.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.300
Go wait in the truck.

20:31.837 --> 20:32.821
Hold up.

20:36.025 --> 20:37.442
You forgot something.

20:47.053 --> 20:48.670
Stay with him.

20:53.843 --> 20:56.327
I just can't believe
someone from our community

20:56.379 --> 20:58.329
would be involved in this.

20:58.381 --> 21:00.515
Don't underestimate
a pack leader's influence.

21:00.599 --> 21:03.551
These guys are being manipulated
into playing his game.

21:03.636 --> 21:05.053
We think at least
one member of the pack

21:05.137 --> 21:06.971
didn't know that
the women were being killed.

21:07.039 --> 21:08.640
Why here? Why now?

21:08.707 --> 21:11.142
Each of the women was abducted on Friday
night and not killed until Sunday.

21:11.210 --> 21:12.277
So?

21:12.344 --> 21:13.511
So why are they avoiding
the work week?

21:13.579 --> 21:14.512
Could be blue collar.

21:14.580 --> 21:15.713
They like the game,

21:15.781 --> 21:17.232
but they can't let it
interfere with their jobs.

21:17.316 --> 21:19.150
I don't think so.
The pack strikes

21:19.218 --> 21:22.353
not only on the clubs' busiest
nights but also the cheapest.

21:22.421 --> 21:23.855
They have a limited income,

21:23.923 --> 21:25.356
they blend in
with a young crowd,

21:25.424 --> 21:27.192
and they're unavailable
Monday to Friday.

21:27.259 --> 21:29.227
If one of them
is from out of state,

21:29.295 --> 21:31.863
that would explain why they
didn't start their killing

21:31.931 --> 21:33.364
until the summer was over.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.401
What would?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.636
We believe the men we're looking
for are college students.

21:38.704 --> 21:41.673
That's why the killings coincided with
the beginning of the fall semester.

21:41.724 --> 21:44.709
This means they're most likely
in their late teens to mid-20s,

21:44.760 --> 21:46.711
but don't rule out older
students who transferred in

21:46.762 --> 21:48.713
or enlisted in the military
right out of high school.

21:48.764 --> 21:51.549
Right now we're canvassing
colleges in the area.

21:51.617 --> 21:53.184
College students
are impressionable kids

21:53.235 --> 21:55.887
eager to fit in and find
their place in the world.

21:55.955 --> 21:57.422
This environment
is conducive

21:57.490 --> 21:58.990
to the creation of a pack.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.860
In a typical pack, not all
members are created equally.

22:01.927 --> 22:04.228
There'll be a dominant one,
an Alpha personality

22:04.280 --> 22:06.498
who's most likely the oldest
member of the group.

22:06.565 --> 22:08.166
We believe he could be
from out of state

22:08.234 --> 22:10.618
and has likely committed
similar crimes before.

22:10.703 --> 22:13.338
The lieutenant will be fiercely
loyal to the pack leader.

22:13.405 --> 22:14.839
The Alpha demands this.

22:14.907 --> 22:16.674
He probably comes from
a broken home

22:16.742 --> 22:18.743
where he felt a loss
the dominant was able to fill.

22:18.811 --> 22:21.078
And finally,
we have the follower,

22:21.130 --> 22:22.347
the newest member of the pack.

22:22.414 --> 22:24.149
He hasn't cemented his loyalty
to the Alpha

22:24.216 --> 22:27.552
when already he's starting to
question his role in the group.

22:27.603 --> 22:30.855
It's unlikely this member is privy to
the pack leader's ultimate agenda.

22:30.923 --> 22:34.359
It won't be long before the dominant
realizes the low man is a liability.

22:34.426 --> 22:37.028
We need to find this man
before the pack eliminates him.

22:37.096 --> 22:38.363
How do we do that?

22:38.430 --> 22:39.931
We drive a wedge between them.

22:39.982 --> 22:41.533
Amp up the pressure.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.003
This is our best chance
of finding Stephanie alive.

23:06.292 --> 23:08.476
How do they know
where we go to school?

23:08.561 --> 23:11.179
They're going to every
campus in the area. Chill.

23:13.899 --> 23:15.800
No.

23:15.851 --> 23:17.669
I'm out.

23:17.736 --> 23:19.320
No one's out.

23:19.405 --> 23:20.488
No, look, ok?

23:20.573 --> 23:22.640
I'm not gonna
tell anyone.

23:22.708 --> 23:24.776
I swear. Ok?

23:24.827 --> 23:26.477
I'm gonna skip town.

23:26.529 --> 23:27.996
Just calm down and be smart.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.531
We'll figure it out.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.350
I can't.

23:32.418 --> 23:34.369
I just can't.

23:38.841 --> 23:41.659
You brought him in,
you fix it.

23:46.232 --> 23:47.832
I come bearing new information.

23:47.883 --> 23:50.134
After I expanded my search
nationwide,

23:50.185 --> 23:54.639
CODIS bounced back a DNA match to
a series of rapes in Louisiana.

23:54.707 --> 23:56.140
The dominant's
done it before.

23:56.191 --> 23:57.709
DNA matched only one unsub,

23:57.776 --> 23:59.978
but there's another sample
in the Louisiana cases.

24:00.029 --> 24:01.412
He had partners before.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.580
Just not the same ones.

24:02.648 --> 24:04.048
So he moves on when
the pack dissolves.

24:04.116 --> 24:06.901
Louisiana P.D. were crazy close
to solving who done it,

24:06.986 --> 24:08.903
but then the rapes stopped.
Two locals went missing

24:08.988 --> 24:10.872
and they pinned the crimes
on them.

24:10.956 --> 24:12.991
I'm sure they didn't
just happen to disappear.

24:13.058 --> 24:14.459
Garcia, do a search
of local colleges

24:14.526 --> 24:15.793
for students
from Louisiana.

24:15.861 --> 24:17.862
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
Garcia out.

24:17.930 --> 24:19.998
If he's killed his partners
before, he'll do it again.

24:20.065 --> 24:21.532
But if he kills
his accomplices,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.668
Stephanie Wilson
is as good as gone.

24:29.258 --> 24:31.242
Everything's
gonna be all right.

24:31.310 --> 24:32.594
How?

24:32.678 --> 24:34.912
The Feds
are closing in on us.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.351
Where are we going?

24:40.402 --> 24:41.886
Michael has a plan.

24:41.954 --> 24:43.404
I don't trust him.

24:43.489 --> 24:45.073
You trust me, don't you?

24:45.157 --> 24:47.224
Yes. I trust you,

24:47.276 --> 24:49.427
but...Michael
is unpredictable.

24:49.495 --> 24:51.529
How do you not see that?

24:51.597 --> 24:53.698
I've known him
a lot longer than you have.

24:53.766 --> 24:54.782
All right?

24:54.867 --> 24:57.585
Have faith.

25:01.473 --> 25:03.574
Why are we stopping?

25:03.642 --> 25:06.844
We're ditching the truck
and skipping town.

25:15.270 --> 25:18.589
So, what, we're just gonna leave the
truck in the middle of nowhere?

25:18.657 --> 25:20.725
Yep.

25:22.394 --> 25:23.778
Who's that?

25:23.862 --> 25:26.197
It's just Michael
coming to pick us up.

25:26.264 --> 25:28.566
Why didn't you tell me?

25:28.634 --> 25:30.785
Relax, would you.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.644
You ready?

25:39.712 --> 25:41.846
Yes, sir.

25:46.218 --> 25:47.618
What the hell, man?!

25:47.686 --> 25:49.587
It's time you learned
a lesson in loyalty, Scotty.

25:49.655 --> 25:52.557
I thought
you were my friend.

25:55.594 --> 25:57.128
Uhh!

26:01.900 --> 26:03.701
What's this for?

26:06.021 --> 26:07.705
Finish the job.

26:07.773 --> 26:10.341
What are you talking about?
He's learned his lesson.

26:10.409 --> 26:13.044
Lesson's not his,
it's yours.

26:13.112 --> 26:14.645
Finish him.

26:14.713 --> 26:17.248
I'm not a killer, man.

26:19.618 --> 26:21.586
You are now.

26:27.393 --> 26:29.227
No...

26:29.294 --> 26:31.328
There's only one way
out the brotherhood.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.097
Don't do that.

26:34.466 --> 26:36.934
No.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.438
Don't do this.

26:42.558 --> 26:44.509
Chris, I'm your friend.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.077
Chris, don't, please!

26:46.145 --> 26:47.378
I'm sorry.

26:47.446 --> 26:49.680
Please don't do this!

26:49.732 --> 26:51.866
No, no, no!

26:51.950 --> 26:53.851
Aah!

27:50.298 --> 27:53.350
Keep it together, Chris.

28:04.937 --> 28:05.637
Stephanie?

28:05.711 --> 28:07.478
No. Male victim.

28:07.546 --> 28:10.648
We managed to I.D.
what was left of him.

28:10.716 --> 28:11.983
Name's Scott Kagan.

28:12.051 --> 28:14.102
He was a sophomore
at Ernstrom College.

28:14.186 --> 28:15.486
This might be
one of our unsubs.

28:15.554 --> 28:17.105
We said they'd eliminate
the weakest link,

28:17.189 --> 28:18.656
and it looks like
he was it.

28:18.724 --> 28:20.158
The pack isn't just
breaking apart,

28:20.226 --> 28:21.826
they're completely
collapsing.

28:21.893 --> 28:22.994
Rather than kill
Stephanie Wilson,

28:23.061 --> 28:24.495
they decided to eliminate
one of their own.

28:24.563 --> 28:26.114
I mean, how long until
the lieutenant realizes

28:26.198 --> 28:27.949
that he's expendable
as well?

28:28.033 --> 28:30.501
Hopefully soon. Stephanie may have gained
another day, but that's not gonna last.

28:30.569 --> 28:31.970
We have another problem,

28:32.037 --> 28:33.171
that they've changed pattern also.
We're 3 counties away

28:33.238 --> 28:34.305
from the normal
disposal area.

28:34.373 --> 28:36.307
Maybe they saw
the patrol cars

28:36.375 --> 28:38.259
at the usual dumping grounds
and got spooked.

28:38.344 --> 28:39.377
No, not a chance.

28:39.445 --> 28:40.929
My guys were parked
at the edge of the field.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.213
No one saw them.

28:42.264 --> 28:44.549
Well, then maybe they knew
about the patrols in advance.

28:46.936 --> 28:49.587
Scott Kagan looks like
a super outcast.

28:49.655 --> 28:51.789
Record of marijuana
possession in high school,

28:51.857 --> 28:53.758
moved on to harder stuff
in college.

28:53.826 --> 28:56.094
Scott rushed the fraternity
Kappa Iota Phi,

28:56.161 --> 28:58.496
but was thrown out before
he became a full member.

28:58.564 --> 29:01.099
According to his school counselor records,
he never really fit in anywhere.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.467
Well, not for lack of trying.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.302
That's exactly what made him
vulnerable to the Alpha.

29:04.370 --> 29:06.704
He didn't stand a chance.
The dominant befriended him

29:06.772 --> 29:08.106
and gave him
a place to belong.

29:08.173 --> 29:11.042
Garcia, we know the pack leader
is connected to the rapes

29:11.110 --> 29:13.811
in Louisiana.
Do any students at Ernstrom College

29:13.879 --> 29:15.313
match to that area?

29:15.381 --> 29:16.347
No such lucky.

29:16.415 --> 29:18.299
I have cross-referenced
with profile,

29:18.384 --> 29:20.652
location, and criminal record.
I have zilch.

29:20.719 --> 29:21.986
Let's concentrate
on the lieutenant.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.187
He's our local
connection.

29:23.255 --> 29:24.522
Check the entire state,

29:24.590 --> 29:26.224
Fort Wayne to evansville.

29:26.291 --> 29:28.693
This guy knows the country roads
like the back of his hand.

29:28.761 --> 29:31.329
Like Scott, both members
were probably rejected

29:31.397 --> 29:33.815
by Fraternities
or Athletic Organizations.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.467
Their actions must have been deemed
inappropriate to get them kicked out,

29:36.535 --> 29:38.152
not just drug offenses
but violence as well.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.138
And they knew about
the police traps.

29:40.205 --> 29:42.507
At least one of the unsubs is
connected to the investigation.

29:42.574 --> 29:43.841
Do you think they have
an inside man?

29:43.909 --> 29:45.810
It's possible.

29:45.861 --> 29:49.614
Run background checks on members
of the Sheriff's Department,

29:49.665 --> 29:53.818
civilians and officers alike.

30:23.148 --> 30:25.850
I'd like to speak
to the Sheriff.

30:28.404 --> 30:30.288
This is Sheriff Salters.

30:30.356 --> 30:32.190
Hello?

30:32.257 --> 30:35.293
Hello, is anyone there?

30:43.585 --> 30:46.471
Everything ok?

30:46.538 --> 30:48.306
Yeah.

30:48.374 --> 30:49.907
Fine.

31:07.893 --> 31:09.861
Who you calling, buddy?

31:09.912 --> 31:11.295
No one.

31:15.634 --> 31:17.468
Sheriff's office.

31:21.607 --> 31:24.308
Now, why'd you have to go
and do something like that?

31:26.211 --> 31:29.130
Sir, I need to talk to you guys
really, really alone.

31:29.214 --> 31:30.965
Ok. Hang on.

31:31.049 --> 31:34.185
Conference room.

31:42.795 --> 31:43.861
Go ahead, Garcia.

31:43.946 --> 31:45.262
I ran a list of police officers

31:45.314 --> 31:47.148
with children who go
to Ernstrom College,

31:47.232 --> 31:51.135
and I cross-referenced that with my
flagged campus violent offenders.

31:51.203 --> 31:52.136
What did you find?

31:52.204 --> 31:53.471
My apologies, sir,

31:53.539 --> 31:55.640
but Sheriff Salters has a son

31:55.707 --> 31:57.141
that goes to Ernstrom,

31:57.209 --> 32:00.128
and the deeper I dig,
the more interesting it gets.

32:00.212 --> 32:03.514
It appears young Salters
has a sealed record.

32:03.582 --> 32:05.115
I already did that.
Unseal it.

32:05.167 --> 32:06.451
And it's blank.

32:06.518 --> 32:08.152
What do you mean?

32:08.220 --> 32:09.487
Everything in it
has been erased.

32:09.555 --> 32:10.988
Who'd know better
that the FBI are here

32:11.056 --> 32:12.557
than someone living with a cop?

32:12.624 --> 32:13.975
Do you think Salters knows?

32:14.059 --> 32:15.393
How could he?

32:15.461 --> 32:17.829
He's searching for a leak
in his own department,

32:17.896 --> 32:18.830
only he's the leak.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.148
Garcia, dig up
everything you can

32:20.232 --> 32:21.816
on Salters and his son.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.133
Yes, sir.

32:23.185 --> 32:25.770
Stay here.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.507
Sheriff,
I need to talk to you.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.509
I'm busy.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.644
Then I can come back
with a warrant.

32:33.712 --> 32:35.313
Your son Chris
has a sealed record,

32:35.380 --> 32:37.148
but I think I know
what's in it.

32:37.216 --> 32:40.685
He's been arrested for assault and
probably drug violations, too,

32:40.752 --> 32:42.153
and you've covered up
for him.

32:42.221 --> 32:45.690
That's why it didn't turn
up in our initial search.

32:50.379 --> 32:52.763
Are you a father,
Agent Hotchner?

32:52.831 --> 32:53.731
Yes, I am.

32:53.799 --> 32:55.967
Well, then you understand.

32:56.034 --> 33:00.137
I couldn't let these, uh,
these incidents

33:00.205 --> 33:02.173
ruin Chris' future.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.141
I understand
that if you run your home

33:04.193 --> 33:05.643
the way you run
your department,

33:05.694 --> 33:09.180
then you bully your family the
way you bully your officers.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.848
I run a tight ship.

33:10.916 --> 33:14.986
How long ago did your wife stop
putting up with it and leave you?

33:15.053 --> 33:16.988
You son of a bitch.

33:17.055 --> 33:18.239
How many times
have you hit Chris?

33:18.323 --> 33:21.525
How dare you accuse me
of abusing my son!

33:21.577 --> 33:23.327
You call it discipline.

33:23.378 --> 33:24.829
You hit Chris in order
to maintain control,

33:24.880 --> 33:26.664
but you lost that control
a long time ago.

33:26.732 --> 33:28.165
Has he started
to hit you back yet?

33:28.233 --> 33:29.834
Don't tell me
how to raise my son.

33:29.902 --> 33:32.169
You've covered up domestic disturbance
violations and drug offenses.

33:32.237 --> 33:33.871
Have you covered up
anything else?

33:33.939 --> 33:35.673
What are you getting at?

33:35.741 --> 33:37.742
Have you discussed details
of the case with Chris?

33:37.809 --> 33:40.778
Did you tell him
about the checkpoints?

33:42.581 --> 33:44.715
He was asking me
about my day.

33:44.783 --> 33:47.151
That was in order
to escape detection.

33:47.219 --> 33:49.887
I'm sorry, Sheriff, your son's
right in the middle of this,

33:49.955 --> 33:51.289
and if you don't help us
find him,

33:51.356 --> 33:53.824
we're gonna lose him
and Stephanie Wilson.

34:01.192 --> 34:03.375
Hotch, he's not in the dorms and
he's not answering his phone.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.892
You know, if Salters inflicts
physical punishment on Chris,

34:04.976 --> 34:06.894
then it's highly unlikely
he's the Alpha of the group.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.879
No, based on what we know,
Chris wouldn't be the dominant,

34:08.947 --> 34:10.414
nor would he have
the confidence to lead.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.382
But if the dominant
protected Chris...

34:12.449 --> 34:14.016
He'd have
his unwavering loyalty.

34:14.069 --> 34:15.235
Sheriff, when Chris
started Ernstrom,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.237
was there an upperclassman
who befriended him

34:17.322 --> 34:19.322
or who he looked up to?

34:19.373 --> 34:22.493
Did he join a Fraternity?
Did he play on a sports team?

34:22.560 --> 34:23.494
He didn't do this.

34:23.545 --> 34:26.330
Garcia, anything?

34:26.398 --> 34:27.664
I'm searching, sir.

34:30.301 --> 34:32.386
Track team.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.754
And Kappa Iota Phi.

34:33.838 --> 34:34.871
That's what
we've been missing.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.274
Garcia, expand your previous
Louisiana search

34:37.342 --> 34:38.509
to former Ernstrom students

34:38.576 --> 34:40.543
who fit our offender
profile.

34:40.594 --> 34:43.547
Narrowing, narrowing...

34:43.614 --> 34:44.782
Molto bene.

34:44.849 --> 34:46.766
Michael Kosina of Louisiana.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.119
Uh, let's see.
He was kicked out of Kappa Iota Phi

34:49.187 --> 34:52.121
after questionable sexual
conduct with a student in 2004.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.690
The charges were dropped.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.059
But the incident earned
the fraternity probation

34:56.127 --> 34:57.194
from its national chapter.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.562
Michael Kosina.
I met him.

34:58.613 --> 34:59.863
He caused
Chris' bar fight.

34:59.914 --> 35:01.064
He did this to my son?

35:01.132 --> 35:03.400
Were Kosina and Chris
at Ernstrom at the same time?

35:03.468 --> 35:04.902
Yeah. Chris was a freshman
when he was a senior.

35:04.969 --> 35:07.237
Michael dropped out
a few weeks later

35:07.305 --> 35:08.806
after he got into an altercation
with one of his professors.

35:08.873 --> 35:09.907
This type of dominant

35:09.974 --> 35:12.409
would definitely have issues
with authority.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.794
Tell me you got
an address, baby girl.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.345
En route as we flirt, baby.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.298
Morgan, wait until
Sheriff Salters arrives.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.950
He might be able
to talk to Chris.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.251
All right, but, you know,
Hotch, if that doesn't work,

35:21.302 --> 35:22.786
Prentiss could be
our best shot.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.388
True. The pack
objectifies women.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.391
They wouldn't know how to handle
negotiating with one.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.927
We gotta hit the road.

35:29.994 --> 35:30.928
Why?

35:30.995 --> 35:32.596
They're getting too close.

35:32.647 --> 35:33.764
No, they're not.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.599
It doesn't matter.
They're in our heads.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.934
First Scott and now you.

35:37.001 --> 35:38.285
You can trust me.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.470
Really?

35:41.439 --> 35:43.674
Look, I didn't say anything,
I swear.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.375
Doesn't mean you won't
next time.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.677
We're leaving.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.212
Where are we going?

35:48.279 --> 35:49.746
I don't know yet.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.849
I have to make a stop first.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.426
Trust is earned.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.616
What are you
going to do to me?

36:27.335 --> 36:28.986
Don't worry, baby.

36:29.053 --> 36:31.421
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.208
Ok? Stand up.
Here we go.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.161
Come on.

36:40.515 --> 36:42.032
Hey.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.052
We do this,
we're free and clear.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.888
Huh? No more pops
telling you what to do.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.406
We hit the road
to a brand-new life,

36:49.474 --> 36:51.558
just you and me,
brother, to the end.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.076
To the end.

36:57.448 --> 36:59.733
Away we go.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.493
Hey!

37:09.544 --> 37:10.661
Chris Salters!

37:10.712 --> 37:12.996
Michael Kosina!

37:13.064 --> 37:15.365
FBI. Give yourselves up.

37:15.416 --> 37:17.134
We want to negotiate.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.552
The time for that
is over, son.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.721
Oh, I wish I was your son,
Sheriff.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.906
It wouldn't be my ribs
getting bruised.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.909
Christopher, walk this way
and we'll work it out.

37:25.977 --> 37:29.446
Don't you get it?
He's done taking orders from you.

37:29.514 --> 37:32.583
Sorry, dad. Can't.

37:33.568 --> 37:35.569
Prentiss, go. Go.

37:37.789 --> 37:38.855
Michael.

37:38.906 --> 37:40.274
Chris.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.777
My name's Emily Prentiss.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.696
I'm holstering my weapon.

37:45.747 --> 37:47.631
I just want to talk.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.249
That's what they all say.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.618
That's quite a feat,

37:51.703 --> 37:55.706
manipulating a cop's son into
committing rape and murder.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.592
Shouldn't we be talking about how your
fine ass is gonna get us out of here?

37:58.676 --> 37:59.743
You wish.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.378
Look around.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.047
Everyone's guns
are trained on you.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.717
Not Chris. You.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.101
No one wants to shoot
a cop's kid.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.970
But you?

38:10.054 --> 38:12.055
I might shoot you myself.

38:12.106 --> 38:13.790
You call yourself
a negotiator?

38:13.858 --> 38:16.943
Chris, I know you're loyal
to Michael. I get it.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.763
He was there for you when
you thought nobody else was.

38:19.814 --> 38:21.097
Nobody was.

38:21.149 --> 38:22.666
That might be true.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.736
But you need to understand
that Michael's done this before.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.771
Don't listen to this bitch!

38:27.822 --> 38:29.239
She's trying to get us
to surrender.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.974
We should rush them now.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.109
You don't want to do that,
Chris, do you?

38:33.161 --> 38:36.780
That's suicide, for you.
Michael doesn't care.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.050
He was gonna kill you the moment
things got tough, anyway.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.919
Just like he killed
his last team.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.488
What's she talking about?

38:44.555 --> 38:45.789
Two men went missing

38:45.857 --> 38:47.758
following a series of rapes

38:47.825 --> 38:49.192
in Northern Louisiana.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.228
What do you think
happened to them?

38:53.481 --> 38:55.515
Is that true?

38:56.601 --> 38:58.635
Were you gonna kill me, too?

38:58.686 --> 39:00.303
What do you mean, too?

39:00.371 --> 39:01.521
I didn't kill Scott.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.689
You did.

39:04.359 --> 39:06.743
You said that
it was to protect us.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.213
Us, me. It's all the same.

39:10.281 --> 39:13.316
It don't matter, anyway. We're not
getting out of here, either one of us.

39:13.384 --> 39:17.371
I need to know
you're with me.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.956
To the end.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.842
Well?

39:26.297 --> 39:27.764
Too late.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.550
Aah!

39:30.635 --> 39:32.436
Aah! Ohh!

39:35.556 --> 39:36.556
What did you do?!

39:36.641 --> 39:38.525
Put it down!
Put it down!

39:38.609 --> 39:40.560
It's over, Christopher.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.895
It's over.

39:44.582 --> 39:45.682
I am not going to jail.

39:45.733 --> 39:47.567
We'll get you
a good lawyer.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.286
We'll figure out a way to
get your sentence reduced.

39:49.353 --> 39:50.537
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, dad?

39:50.621 --> 39:52.406
A chance to play hero.

39:52.490 --> 39:53.407
Son...

39:53.491 --> 39:55.926
Well, too late.

39:55.993 --> 39:58.161
You don't get too win this one.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.400
Medic, we need a medic.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.518
I had to, son.

41:12.336 --> 41:14.371
Sheriff?

41:14.438 --> 41:18.325
It's time for us to go.

41:20.328 --> 41:21.945
Yeah.

41:26.050 --> 41:29.553
You know, I keep asking
myself what I did wrong.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.792
How did my son
become a murderer?

41:37.862 --> 41:40.430
There's an answer
that a profiler could give you,

41:40.498 --> 41:43.066
but you don't
need to hear that.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.702
And you don't need
any criticism from me.

41:47.238 --> 41:50.740
All I can say is
that in my own life,

41:50.808 --> 41:53.510
I try to run
a very tight ship at work,

41:53.578 --> 41:55.745
and then when I come home,
I try to give my son

41:55.813 --> 41:59.716
all the love and compassion and
understanding that he deserves.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.785
And I'm not saying
this is your failing,

42:01.853 --> 42:05.088
but something made Chris
vulnerable.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.229
I know I've lost him.

42:13.831 --> 42:15.699
I don't think you have.

42:15.766 --> 42:17.267
It's going to take every
connection I've ever had

42:17.335 --> 42:18.869
to keep him
off death row.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.472
And after that, he's going
to need you more than ever.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.109
Chris is lost.

42:26.177 --> 42:29.613
But he doesn't have to spend
the rest of his life that way.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.150
What can I do?

42:34.218 --> 42:36.052
Be there for him.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.955
Make amends.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.724
And help him do the same.

42:50.668 --> 42:53.003
Good luck.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.071
Thank you.

we are all plain people

43:04.081 --> 43:07.083
