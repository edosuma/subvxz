00:00.001 --> 00:04.069
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Francis: <i>The duke of guise,</i>
<i>your uncle, is</i>

00:04.071 --> 00:06.238
<i>A dangerously ambitious man.</i>
<i>I read your letter.</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:07.740
I wrote that letter thinking
I'd never see you again.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.608
Mary: <i>I know.</i>
<i>None of us are responsible</i>

00:09.610 --> 00:12.511
<i>For our hearts--</i>
<i>only our actions.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.346
Catherine:
<i>I do read henry's bible.</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.749
It belonged to henry,
and henry went mad,

00:16.751 --> 00:18.350
<i>And now it belongs to you.</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.119
<i>You've been poisoned.</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.353
Antoine: <i>I think this sebastian</i>
<i>is the man</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:23.489
Responsible for
our brother's death.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.391
The ledger we found
in your accounting house

00:25.393 --> 00:27.092
Is enough to prove
your guilt.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.095
You may keep your life,
but that is all you may keep.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.165
â™ª

00:37.103 --> 00:38.103
(laughs)

00:38.105 --> 00:40.105
You didn't say the race was

00:40.107 --> 00:42.107
Starting from
the bottom of the hill.

00:42.109 --> 00:45.144
It isn't very sporting
to just sit down, is it?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.146
Hurry up, missus.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.281
Isn't this
what husbands are for?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.116
Or servants?

00:51.118 --> 00:53.318
â™ª I know there's something
for you out there â™ª

00:53.320 --> 00:55.187
â™ª in this life

00:55.189 --> 00:57.723
â™ª I know there's something
for you out there â™ª

00:57.725 --> 01:00.092
â™ª in this life...

01:03.163 --> 01:04.163
(talking quietly)

01:04.165 --> 01:07.266
(laughing)

01:09.069 --> 01:12.504
One... Two... Three!

01:12.506 --> 01:14.306
(women laughing)

01:14.308 --> 01:16.475
â™ª I know there's something
for you out there â™ª

01:16.477 --> 01:17.643
â™ª in this life

01:17.645 --> 01:19.778
â™ª I know there's something...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.513
Kenna, come, the chocolate.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.583
Coming.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.584
Oh, lovely.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.486
Thank you.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.456
â™ª in this life...

01:30.458 --> 01:32.124
CondÃ©.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.725
It's a magnificent
day, isn't it?

01:33.727 --> 01:35.360
Where has lola
gone off to?

01:35.362 --> 01:37.463
I suggested I speak to you
on both our behalf.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.598
That sounds promising.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.333
I invited her to my estate
in condÃ©, and she's accepted.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.269
It would only be a few days,
a holiday, where we might

01:44.271 --> 01:45.604
Get to know each other better.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.239
With your permission,
as she is your lady.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.209
Well, that-that does
sound promising.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.810
Of course I give you
my permission.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.879
Mm.

01:55.849 --> 01:59.318
So strange, isn't it?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.887
Both of us married and
yet more alone than ever.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.291
(women laughing)

02:06.293 --> 02:07.626
Lady kenna.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.195
Come on. You said
you needed a partner.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.197
Not you!
It's not appropriate.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.199
I've got more weight than any
of those ladies you're trying

02:14.201 --> 02:15.501
To recruit, and it
helps with the speed.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.369
(laughs):
No!

02:17.371 --> 02:18.637
Oh, bash, you're here!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.172
How wonderful!

02:20.174 --> 02:22.207
I'm sorry I can't stay.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.842
I have some business
with the kingsguard--

02:23.844 --> 02:25.244
Someone needs
replacing.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.712
Antoine:
You're the king's brother.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.247
I thought the whole point
of being a royal

02:28.249 --> 02:29.615
Was to get other people
to do things for you.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.350
I'm not a royal,

02:31.352 --> 02:34.353
And I doubt
our king would agree with you.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.188
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep

02:36.190 --> 02:38.190
Your hands off my wife.
Bash, stop it!

02:38.192 --> 02:39.491
You're embarrassing me.
Excuse me, brother.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.759
A word?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.528
It's about your wife.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.398
You know, if you did
anything other than work,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.333
Things like this
wouldn't happen.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.904
Whatever your grudge is
against bash...

02:51.906 --> 02:53.772
He maimed our brother
and caused his death.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.374
You won't settle it
by ruining his marriage.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.876
True. It's just a start,

02:57.878 --> 03:00.279
But it might
bring me pleasure.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.914
Great pleasure,
I would guess.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.615
I'm leaving court for a few days

03:03.617 --> 03:05.350
To go to my estate.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.419
Leave with me
and go home to your wife.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.490
What?
It's made more complicated

03:11.492 --> 03:12.925
By the fact that she's ill.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.259
Ill?

03:14.261 --> 03:15.794
With what affliction is she ill?

03:15.796 --> 03:16.962
There's a growth.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.864
Pain.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.832
The physician said
it won't be long.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.768
Jeanne is dying?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.538
Why aren't you with her?

03:26.540 --> 03:30.242
She's a private woman and wanted
only those closest to her near.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.411
What can I say?
I didn't make the short list,

03:32.413 --> 03:33.612
Given our unhappiness.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.347
I am sorry, antoine.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.550
So you'll forgive me if I seek

03:38.552 --> 03:40.352
Distraction elsewhere.
Find a hobby

03:40.354 --> 03:43.255
Or a whore or something other
than revenge to occupy you.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.991
You risk both our lives
going after the king's brother.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.227
If I have to,
I will stop you myself.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.728
No, you won't.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.597
The house of valois
against the house of bourbon,

03:51.599 --> 03:53.632
Brothers against brothers--
for that is what it would be.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.567
There would be
no choice.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.569
I would die for you,
louis, willingly.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.305
And I believe you would
do the same for me.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.307
Enjoy your holiday.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.875
I'll be here when you return.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.991
(panting softly)

04:21.794 --> 04:24.496
Your majesty,
the duke of guise.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.301
Mary:
<i>Uncle?</i>

04:29.303 --> 04:31.570
You want your old position back?
Are you mad?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.538
I was appointed the king's
magistrate by francis,

04:33.540 --> 04:34.940
And I took the
job seriously,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.942
Tamping down uprisings
across the land.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.411
You ran the minute
you heard the word "plague."

04:39.413 --> 04:41.880
And kept the king's order in the
east, at great risk to myself.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.582
You fled to save yourself.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.318
And left me,
your niece, unguarded.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.887
Can one man
conquer a disease?

04:48.889 --> 04:52.491
No. But I can protect you
from those who would harm you.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.892
Like the bourbons,
who have managed

04:53.894 --> 04:56.361
To install themselves
in your court.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.763
I don't know antoine well,
but louis is

04:57.765 --> 04:59.731
A friend to the realm
and a friend to me.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.999
Not politically.
Their line has been

05:01.001 --> 05:02.801
Angling for the
throne for gener...

05:02.803 --> 05:04.803
For generations, yes.
You sound like catherine.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.805
Why she hasn't
assassinated them

05:06.807 --> 05:09.374
While they're here at
court is a mystery to me.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.643
Catherine has called
for a family luncheon.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.648
My family, not yours.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.650
You may stay,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.652
But I don't believe
you're here to protect me,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.754
Or for a post you know
francis has rescinded.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.660
Ma'am.

05:31.564 --> 05:34.566
If this is a family dinner,
what's narcisse doing here?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.535
We made a discovery,
stephan and I,

05:36.537 --> 05:39.338
About my recent hallucinations.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.707
I know the thinking
was that I was ill...

05:41.709 --> 05:43.342
Syphilitic, you mean.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.743
Diseased.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.678
But in fact I was poisoned.

05:48.481 --> 05:52.451
By our family bible,
the one that your father

05:52.453 --> 05:53.719
Used to read for comfort,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.620
As did I,
after his death.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.856
Now, the poison had
affected our personalities,

05:57.858 --> 05:59.691
Each differently.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.793
It also altered my palate.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.095
I crave sweets.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.129
(chuckles)

06:04.131 --> 06:05.497
Mmm.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.932
Everything else
tastes like metal.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.066
A poisoned bible, are you sure?

06:08.068 --> 06:10.702
We tested it ourselves.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.607
The question is:
Who poisoned it?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.776
Yes, that would be the question.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.644
Thank you, narcisse,
for pointing out the obvious.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.480
And would you stop
doting on my mother.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.714
Oh, now, now.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.849
He was there for me

06:23.851 --> 06:25.817
In my hour of need.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.054
He already has a lead
on the poisoner.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.822
So much for
your investigative skills.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.058
I helped you and claude.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.026
You're just angry with him
because diane was here.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.161
How is she, bash?

06:36.163 --> 06:38.463
Back in paris?
I assume so, yes.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.732
Can we focus on

06:40.734 --> 06:42.634
Who is responsible
for this, please?

06:42.636 --> 06:45.804
One stands out: Frederic mazur.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.474
He was one of henry's
most trusted first-valets--

06:49.476 --> 06:52.511
Whom, according to the other
servants, encouraged henry

06:52.513 --> 06:54.446
To seek solace and absolution

06:54.448 --> 06:56.648
Within scripture,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.784
And who fled
the moment henry died.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.154
While the other servants waited
to receive gifts

07:02.156 --> 07:03.155
The king had
bequeathed.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.890
I'll look into it.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.758
Whoever did this
destroyed the mind of a king,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.894
But the damage
didn't stop there.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.030
It was henry's madness that
led to his hunger for England,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.900
And to the death of
so many, to his own

07:14.902 --> 07:17.636
Untimely demise,
and to you becoming king

07:17.638 --> 07:19.171
At such a tender age,

07:19.173 --> 07:22.641
Amidst so much
religious hatred and unrest.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.611
We have all been hurt by
this assassin's poison.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.080
And no one hurts my family
and lives to tell the tale.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.816
Whoever they are,

07:30.818 --> 07:33.652
They will pay the price.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.153
And their family will weep

07:35.155 --> 07:38.156
Tears stained
with blood.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.837
Catherine:
Look what survived the plague.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.673
I heard you were back
to claim your old post.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.775
Good luck with that.
I have a confession to make.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.077
That's not really
why I'm here.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.812
I see you're no longer
wearing black.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.549
I gave up with that
weeks after henry passed.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.952
I do as I please
in my own home.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.521
What I meant is your official
mourning period is over.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.890
Oh.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.925
And I'm here to court you.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.495
You say that
like I just won a prize.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.563
(laughs):
You can't be serious.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.866
We had an affection once.
A flirtation, years ago.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.101
Enough of a connection to
get me banished from court.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.737
Oh, you blame that
on your magnetic charm,

08:25.739 --> 08:26.872
Not your double-dealing?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.607
Catherine, please.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.641
Few live past 40.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.109
Must you remind me?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.711
And what years I have left,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.846
I want to spend with an equal.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.115
Someone I can build
something with.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.984
Build what, exactly?

08:38.986 --> 08:41.119
An empire, a
comfortable life,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.654
A power base rooted
in trade routes

08:42.656 --> 08:44.155
Your medici ties
could open up.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.191
How romantic.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.692
It is, because
I'm talking about

08:47.694 --> 08:49.127
Developing a region
I've claimed.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.795
We can call home

08:50.797 --> 08:54.065
And build something to
support your son's rule,

08:54.067 --> 08:57.802
Where your younger ones
could grow up with a father,

08:57.804 --> 09:01.873
Their mother once
again center stage

09:01.875 --> 09:03.942
In her own home.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.946
(people chattering)

09:07.948 --> 09:09.814
(goat bleating)

09:09.816 --> 09:11.983
Kenna:
Ugh!

09:11.985 --> 09:15.020
I thought greer would be living
in a proper manor house.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.888
Well, the servant
who delivered her belongings

09:16.890 --> 09:18.757
Directed me to an inn
along this road.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.258
I think you were
being overly cautious

09:20.260 --> 09:21.860
About leaving our
carriage at a distance.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.128
My shoes are ruined.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.564
Greer is a traitor
in the eyes of the crown.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.899
If we're seen with her, it puts
mary in a terrible position

09:27.901 --> 09:29.968
Of punishing us
or defending her.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.805
(man coughing)

09:35.174 --> 09:37.175
(knocking, door opens)

09:37.177 --> 09:39.277
Greer.
I don't believe it!

09:39.279 --> 09:42.047
Oh, we missed you
and wanted to see how you are.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.049
Look around.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.917
It's awful, isn't it?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.787
Oh, well, it's not terrible,
but we thought that...

09:48.789 --> 09:50.055
Why are you
living like this?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.990
What about
castleroy's money?

09:51.992 --> 09:54.893
Our assets were
immediately seized

09:54.895 --> 09:56.761
When aloysius was ruled
as a traitor.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.897
It's not mary's
fault, it's the law.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.166
What will you do?

10:01.168 --> 10:04.636
Oh, uh...

10:04.638 --> 10:07.339
Let's see.

10:07.341 --> 10:12.611
Think about what I should
do, what I need to do,

10:12.613 --> 10:14.346
(laughs):
What I can do,

10:14.348 --> 10:16.348
And then I go back to sleep.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.817
Then I read a bit,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.686
Think a bit, feel bad a bit,
(chuckles)

10:21.688 --> 10:24.222
Determine to
cheer myself up a bit.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.759
Greer, uh, are you drunk?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.894
It's the stout I've been eating.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.297
Eating stout?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.965
Trick I picked up
downstairs in the tavern.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.166
Quite a bit cheaper than

10:35.168 --> 10:36.835
Traditional food,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.970
And really quite filling.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.172
I'm learning so much.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.143
Francis. You
wanted to see me?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.911
When are condÃ© and lola
leaving for his home?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.647
This evening. Why?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.715
Bash has found some damning
evidence against him.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.250
Frederic, the valet
we were looking into,

10:52.252 --> 10:53.985
The one who had
access to henry.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.186
And the bible.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.322
I posted a
substantial reward

10:57.324 --> 10:58.890
For information
leading to him,

10:58.892 --> 11:02.060
And pieces have
been trickling in.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.828
Frederic mazur
had ties to condÃ©.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.831
Ties the man concealed
when he first came here

11:06.833 --> 11:08.800
And was vetted for a position
so close to the king.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.201
He served the bourbons.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.904
Fighting in condÃ©'s
private army in Spain.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.074
Is that all?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.710
It's the combination of factors.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.979
The missing servant's
allegiance to condÃ©.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.681
The bourbons' hatred
of the valois.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.848
CondÃ©'s appearance at court

11:23.850 --> 11:25.083
Just after our father's death.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.217
His sudden determination

11:26.219 --> 11:27.686
To ingratiate himself here.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.953
He offered you protection

11:28.955 --> 11:31.022
When you had run off after lola

11:31.024 --> 11:32.991
Unguarded during the plague.

11:32.993 --> 11:33.958
Mary,

11:33.960 --> 11:35.193
I know better than anyone

11:35.195 --> 11:36.094
How loyal you are to those

11:36.096 --> 11:37.195
Who are loyal to you.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.329
And it's true that none

11:38.331 --> 11:39.364
Of these things
is damning enough

11:39.366 --> 11:41.266
To detain louis.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.368
Which is why you want me
to get him to stay.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.070
I have a lead on the valet.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.204
I just need time

11:46.206 --> 11:47.739
To follow it.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.374
If condÃ© leaves
and we have to go after him,

11:49.376 --> 11:50.742
Even more blood could be shed.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.943
We might have to extract him

11:51.945 --> 11:53.211
From behind his armies.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.879
So now we're at war?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.082
With a man who has done nothing
but prove his loyalty

11:57.084 --> 11:58.850
To the crown and to me?

11:58.852 --> 12:03.021
I believe that louis' devotion
to you is genuine.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.457
But the events in question,
the poisoning of my father,

12:05.459 --> 12:06.958
Happened before he ever met you.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.061
If he is behind this,
it has nothing to do

12:10.063 --> 12:11.763
With you and everything to do

12:11.765 --> 12:13.098
With the rivalry
between our families.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.899
He may even
have regretted his actions,

12:14.901 --> 12:16.468
Particularly
as events unfolded.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.902
But unfold they did

12:17.904 --> 12:20.238
In a way that hurt you

12:20.240 --> 12:22.807
More than anyone
can ever know and ruined us.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.910
If he is innocent,
let us prove it.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.212
You're the only one he trusts.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.446
Find a way to keep him here.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.948
It is a betrayal.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.750
Deception.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.852
Yes, it is.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.491
Narcisse:
The duke of guise?

12:39.493 --> 12:42.794
You can't be seriously
considering his proposal.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.395
The fact that you've heard
about this proposal

12:44.397 --> 12:47.832
From your still active network
of spies

12:47.834 --> 12:49.901
Does not mean
it's open for discussion.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.070
I knew that you'd
finished mourning,

12:52.072 --> 12:53.404
But I just thought...

12:53.406 --> 12:55.340
Well, I assumed
that you were done with...

12:56.242 --> 12:57.509
...All that.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.377
Men, you mean?

12:59.379 --> 13:02.280
Oh, more accurately,

13:02.282 --> 13:04.149
Did you think that just

13:04.151 --> 13:07.252
Because you don't entertain
women my age

13:07.254 --> 13:08.319
That no other men do?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.021
You judge me unfairly.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.023
No, I've seen the women
you pursue.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.424
My daughter, for example.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.027
That's was purely political.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.796
I amend that;
it was to save her

13:17.798 --> 13:19.564
From a protestant marriage.
Stop.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.901
I'm very grateful for all
the help that you've given,

13:22.903 --> 13:25.270
But a poison bible,

13:25.272 --> 13:28.039
Revisiting my husband's madness
and death at my son's hands,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.407
They all remind me
of your blackmail,

13:29.409 --> 13:31.876
The choices that you forced

13:31.878 --> 13:34.145
Francis to make
and all that it cost him.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.080
Lives were lost, I grant you.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.348
Don't argue with me.

13:38.884 --> 13:42.487
Make it up to me and to my son.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.422
(groans)

13:44.424 --> 13:48.159
The poison is still
in you, isn't it?

13:48.161 --> 13:51.830
You said you had
a lead of your own?

13:51.832 --> 13:54.032
For the valet?
Payments he may
have received

13:54.034 --> 13:56.301
For completing the task.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.204
Follow that lead,
and perhaps then

13:59.206 --> 14:01.906
We can speak of my future
and yours.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.109
You want me to stay for a party?

14:05.111 --> 14:06.511
A royal dinner to thank you

14:06.513 --> 14:07.879
For all you've done for us.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.848
"for us"?

14:09.850 --> 14:12.383
The last time francis
and I spoke, we came to blows.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.986
I believe he regrets
the outburst

14:14.988 --> 14:18.456
And thinks a proper sendoff
would help ease tensions.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.191
So this is a joint effort?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.260
Yes. Why?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.628
I'll tell you in the hopes
that you're frank

14:23.630 --> 14:24.929
With me about why it is

14:24.931 --> 14:26.564
You want me to stay.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.868
Mary, your private life is lived
in a very public way.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.302
In a home filled

14:31.304 --> 14:32.937
With hundreds of nobles
and servants.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.539
There's always talk
of the king and queen.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.507
More so because
they're mesmerized by you.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.877
And what is the current talk?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.912
That francis no longer visits
your chambers.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.413
That even his belongings
have been removed.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.082
That you barely speak.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.584
It pains me to hear that,
because I know how hard

14:46.586 --> 14:48.519
You fought to get back
to each other.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.622
And I have to ask.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.891
What?

14:54.660 --> 14:56.561
If some small part
of this request comes

14:56.563 --> 14:58.329
From the realization that
there's nothing to return to.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.932
That is very presumptuous.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.600
Said the woman who presumes
her friend and I

15:02.602 --> 15:04.535
Will naturally fall in love
simply because it suits her.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.371
I mean, is that
what you want?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.273
For me and lola to find
happiness with each other

15:08.275 --> 15:10.375
Or are we merely chess pieces
that no longer need

15:10.377 --> 15:12.677
To be moved?
You make me sound so cold.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.245
I understand why you did it.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.114
Why you asked us
to give it a chance,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.282
And I'm telling you
our best chance

15:17.284 --> 15:18.416
Is if we leave now.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.952
Well, you can leave
in a day or so.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.288
If you want me to court
your friend,

15:23.290 --> 15:25.290
Don't ask me to spend
another moment in your presence.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.292
Not now.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.027
If you don't want us together,

15:29.029 --> 15:31.162
If it no longer services you,
then say it.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.499
Be honest about the power
you hold over all of us.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.367
Be honest about
what you want.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.369
So we can all get on
with our lives.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.705
I don't want you to court lola.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.507
There.

15:42.509 --> 15:46.244
It's not so hard to live
a more honest life, now is it?

15:54.553 --> 15:56.187
It isn't much,

15:56.189 --> 15:58.122
But any more would be dangerous.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.591
Oh, thank you.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.960
(groans)

16:01.962 --> 16:03.127
I'm nearing eviction.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.729
You say this isn't much,

16:04.731 --> 16:06.264
But it's everything to me.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.200
Greer, have you thought
of returning to scotland?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.336
No.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.604
But what choice do you have?

16:13.606 --> 16:16.107
I will never go home
in disgrace.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.475
And what would be the point?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.677
I doubt my father
would take me in.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.113
But I do have a plan.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.481
(thumping, distant moaning)

16:23.483 --> 16:26.150
I'll find work
as a ladies' companion.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.987
Traitor or not,
I'm of noble birth

16:28.989 --> 16:31.356
And a skilled navigator
of society.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.491
All I have to is
find a noble woman

16:33.493 --> 16:36.427
In need who's not familiar
with my reputation.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.229
(gasps)
someone foreign would be best.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.665
Well, let us help you with that.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.233
Thank you.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.234
(moaning continues)

16:43.236 --> 16:45.336
Oh, not again.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.040
Would you excuse me?

16:49.042 --> 16:51.743
I have to speak
to the whore next door.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.748
Sharlene?

16:59.118 --> 17:00.284
My lady.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.452
Please stop with that.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.221
Greer will more than suffice.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.090
I understand your profession

17:06.092 --> 17:08.726
Is demanding, but I'm trying
to have a conversation

17:08.728 --> 17:10.094
Next door.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.763
A proper conversation,

17:11.765 --> 17:14.032
And, well...

17:15.467 --> 17:17.702
Surely your customer
has been satisfied by now?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.037
(chuckles)

17:19.039 --> 17:20.538
You mean the banging.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.106
Come in.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.441
I'll show you something.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.309
A trick you could use.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.811
Good place to keep your things

17:26.813 --> 17:28.446
So they don't get swiped.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.315
Helps that they nail
the headboard to the wall.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.051
You just have to nail it back.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.486
That should fetch a good price.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.588
Rent's due, isn't it?

17:37.590 --> 17:40.158
And after those runty bitches
on the corner

17:40.160 --> 17:42.193
Told everyone
I serviced a leper,

17:42.195 --> 17:43.494
My regular customers fled.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.662
Can you believe it?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.631
I, um...

17:46.633 --> 17:48.132
I didn't, of course.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.801
Once people start thinking

17:49.803 --> 17:52.203
The worst of you, there's no
turning it around, is there?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.372
In some cases, I'm afraid not.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.640
(chuckles)

17:55.642 --> 17:58.409
Lola:
<i>You want me to end a courtship</i>

17:58.411 --> 18:00.578
That you and mary mandated?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.447
Why?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.082
I can't get into specifics,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.751
But lord condÃ©
is under investigation.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.553
I am trusting you
by even telling you that much,

18:08.555 --> 18:10.455
And if you have feelings
for him,

18:10.457 --> 18:12.723
It puts you
in an especially bad situation.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.259
No, it's fine.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.862
Really, I-I don't mind.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.630
I mean, I enjoyed his company,

18:19.632 --> 18:21.599
But we were only just getting
to know each other,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.734
And-and if he's a traitor,
then I want nothing

18:23.736 --> 18:25.103
To do with him.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.704
Thank you.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.739
I know you were doing this
for mary.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.209
For you and mary.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.778
I hope you know that I consider
you a close friend as well.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.180
More, as we share a son.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.715
Or...

18:37.717 --> 18:39.183
We used

18:39.185 --> 18:40.618
To share a son.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.253
When I enter the nursery,
you leave.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.888
When I leave,
I've caught the nannies

18:43.890 --> 18:45.723
Sending word to you
that I've gone.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.259
Is there something I've done
to offend you?

18:48.261 --> 18:49.460
No.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.129
No, mary...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.397
Saw us lying close

18:53.399 --> 18:55.233
With the baby.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.367
You were asleep.
(sighs)

18:56.369 --> 18:57.902
He was finally asleep.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.771
I didn't want to risk
moving him.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.573
I nodded off.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.509
Mary wasn't angry.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.911
She understood, but...

19:08.147 --> 19:09.881
I pulled back,

19:09.883 --> 19:13.184
Thinking that
if I could just protect her

19:13.186 --> 19:16.387
From feeling one more ounce
of pain, then we might...

19:16.389 --> 19:18.723
The damage was done long before.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.891
I'm so sorry.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.792
I-I didn't realize.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.463
All I meant was...

19:25.465 --> 19:29.267
Well, you're the closest thing
I have to family,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.736
To be honest, and losing
that connection hurt,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.504
That's all.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.206
But I understand completely.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.475
I do.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.744
Antoine:
Lady kenna.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.379
I'm glad to see you again.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.547
Will you and your husband

19:42.549 --> 19:43.814
Be coming to the meal tonight?

19:43.816 --> 19:45.616
You mean
the dinner for your brother?

19:45.618 --> 19:46.884
I'm afraid not.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.387
It's royals only,
and bash is working

19:49.389 --> 19:50.621
This evening anyway.
Enjoy, though.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.423
I hear they're serving
strawberries and snow.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.891
Hmm, strawberries.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.226
In the dead of winter.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.827
I know, isn't it decadent?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.629
It's good to be a royal
this time of year.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.931
Well, seasons change,

19:59.933 --> 20:01.365
Along with everything else.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.600
And who knows

20:02.602 --> 20:04.969
What kind of royal delicacies

20:04.971 --> 20:06.704
May soon be touching
your lips.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.440
King antoine, I'm flattered,

20:09.442 --> 20:11.642
But you must stop, please.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.311
You're beginning to make me
feel uncomfortable.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.979
Well, that was never
my intention.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.647
I apologize, truly.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.449
Accepted.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.290
Lord narcisse.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.593
I was looking forward
to seeing you,

20:28.595 --> 20:31.462
Ever since I heard
you lost everything

20:31.464 --> 20:34.298
Due to
your financial misadventures.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.900
How is it you managed
to remain at court?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.903
My expertise in many areas
is valued by the king.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.339
Not just the king, but
the queen mother, too, I hear.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.673
Hmm.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.444
I'm afraid that friendship
won't continue.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.247
Catherine, aren't you looking...
Lovely.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.382
Oh.
Where are you off to?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.817
Dinner for lord condÃ©.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.452
(sighs) your favorite.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.620
(groans)

20:55.622 --> 20:57.355
And we shall meet after,
correct?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.656
The lavender house.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.524
North end of the grounds.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.860
The greenhouse is magical

21:02.862 --> 21:05.296
This time of year.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.999
I had sex in that
greenhouse once.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.268
It's a lovely venue.

21:12.638 --> 21:16.974
The walls sweat in the heat
as the snow falls outside.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.343
I assume that's
what you will be doing

21:19.345 --> 21:22.013
With that
untrustworthy lox?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.381
A woman of my age?

21:23.383 --> 21:25.449
I find your
suggestion shocking.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.322
(clears throat)

21:31.324 --> 21:32.723
My lord.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.368
Shocking indeed.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.003
(door squeaks)

21:48.340 --> 21:50.641
You are beautiful.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.710
Thank you.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.685
There's no need
for such things.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.821
The servants are aware
of the status of our union.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.489
I think it would be
inviting gossip

22:05.491 --> 22:06.957
To act too much
the couple.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.961
Well, compliment
was genuine.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.698
You seem angry.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.500
I tricked condÃ© into staying
like you asked.

22:16.502 --> 22:20.504
I manipulated him, his life,
and he's not the only one.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.907
You should know, I called off
his courtship of lola.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.843
I had a similar
conversation with her.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.912
What was your excuse?

22:27.914 --> 22:29.847
Does he know that we're
suspicious of him?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.382
No.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.851
You let him think

22:33.853 --> 22:37.121
That you don't want
him to be with her.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.456
I understand.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.590
All for the cause,
I suppose.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.892
And what cause
is that, exactly?

22:41.894 --> 22:43.594
What are we becoming,
francis?

22:43.596 --> 22:44.729
(door squeaks)

22:44.731 --> 22:45.863
Did you find
the valet?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.798
He's dead.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.134
He was killed shortly after
he returned to condÃ©'s region.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.470
You think that's condÃ©
trying to tie up loose ends?

22:52.472 --> 22:54.905
It's what I would do if I paid
someone to poison a monarch.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.073
This is all speculation.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.074
Not all.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.477
Frederic mazur had debts.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.878
Staggering ones,
apparently.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.048
Accumulated at
a gentleman's establishment.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.784
On one occasion, the proprietor
saw condÃ© and frederic

23:06.786 --> 23:08.519
Engaged intensely
on some matter.

23:08.521 --> 23:11.122
Days later, the owner
anonymously received funds,

23:11.124 --> 23:13.758
Absolving frederic's debts.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.760
Just weeks before
our father started

23:15.762 --> 23:17.428
Showing signs
of his illness.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.497
He paid him
to do the job.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.435
I know we don't have hard proof,
not with frederic dead.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.605
We have little choice but to
confront the bourbons directly.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.474
You don't have to be
a part of this.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.909
I want to see his face,

23:31.911 --> 23:33.778
His reaction,
I know him.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.080
At least I think I still do.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.882
You are prepared
for the outcome?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.884
If he is guilty,
there can be no hesitation,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.952
No build up
of support or unrest.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.522
I will have him beheaded
immediately.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.196
The valois really throw
a dismal party, don't they?

23:52.198 --> 23:54.465
For once
I must agree.

23:57.736 --> 23:58.969
Open it up.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.037
(door latches)

24:00.039 --> 24:01.138
Read us a passage.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.015
A bible.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.517
My father kept it close
and read it often.

24:13.519 --> 24:14.518
As did my mother

24:14.520 --> 24:16.520
After he died.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.756
Frederic mazur, my father's
valet, poisoned it.

24:21.059 --> 24:23.060
What is this?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.929
Are you making an accusation?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.664
Frederic served under
your command in Spain.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.900
He returned to your region
after my father died,

24:29.902 --> 24:32.670
Where he was murdered.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.206
Was he on your orders
to poison the king?

24:35.208 --> 24:38.843
So this is why you wanted
to keep me in the castle,

24:38.845 --> 24:40.544
So you can put
me on trial.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.979
We are asking you directly.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.781
Please tell the truth, louis.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.549
This is outrageous.
We know you
paid off frederic,

24:45.551 --> 24:47.551
His debts, the
whorehouse.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.086
We have witnesses
who will testify.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.088
Do you deny it?

24:51.090 --> 24:54.058
Did you pay frederic
to poison my father?

24:54.060 --> 24:55.826
I swear,
my hand to god,

24:55.828 --> 24:57.962
I had nothing
to do with this.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.064
Yes,

25:00.066 --> 25:02.099
Frederic served under me,
and he traded on that connection

25:02.101 --> 25:05.636
To beg me to relieve his debts,
and I refused him.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.871
He may have been
a good man once,

25:06.873 --> 25:07.972
But he fell into whoring
and gambling.

25:07.974 --> 25:08.973
His debts were a bottomless pit.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.975
I don't believe you.

25:10.977 --> 25:14.278
Is this some kind of revenge for
my talks with the english queen?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.047
Are you trying to rid
yourselves of us?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.951
It wasn't
him, francis.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.786
We uncovered a trail
from the bankers.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.121
It was the duke of guise.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.090
He paid the debts.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.958
But that was only
to bait the poisoner.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.728
After your father died,
the poisoner fled

25:30.730 --> 25:33.964
To claim a parcel of land
that he had been granted

25:33.966 --> 25:35.633
From the duke of
guise's holdings.

25:35.635 --> 25:36.700
The deed, no doubt, is a carrot.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.702
The duke.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.604
My uncle poisoned the king?

25:40.606 --> 25:42.072
The duke
despised him.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.009
None of this would
have come to light.

25:45.011 --> 25:48.846
Who would look at a bible and
think it was a murder weapon?

25:48.848 --> 25:52.049
If I hadn't taken
to reading it, by chance.

25:53.685 --> 25:56.186
I have done nothing
but be a friend

25:56.188 --> 25:58.322
To you and francis,

25:58.324 --> 26:00.157
Doing your bidding,
no matter the peril

26:00.159 --> 26:01.292
Or price.

26:01.294 --> 26:02.760
You must understand.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.129
That there is bad blood
between our lines?

26:05.131 --> 26:07.231
You think
I don't know that?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.834
You call us
murderers?

26:10.836 --> 26:13.571
After all you've
done to our family?

26:16.274 --> 26:17.908
You destroyed
our brother...
Louis!

26:17.910 --> 26:19.843
Maimed him, left
him for dead!

26:19.845 --> 26:21.812
Is this true?

26:23.048 --> 26:25.916
In the italian wars.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.852
Wars we fought
for the house of valois.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.257
You stabbed him in the back,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.726
You coward.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.729
You are the murderers.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.274
Our talk about the villa
in Italy...

26:52.210 --> 26:53.911
My brother wasn't sure
it was you.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.747
The man I attacked, I didn't
know he was a bourbon.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.683
All henry told me he was
he was a traitor to France.

26:59.685 --> 27:03.721
I did what I was told out of
loyalty to my father and king.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.222
I'm sorry.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.892
It was
a king's order.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.897
My young brother is emotional.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.900
He has always suffered
from a choleric temperament.

27:16.902 --> 27:20.404
And he was so very young
when our brother died.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.373
As were you,
I'm sure.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.643
Well, it was another generation
who forced your hand.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.279
We must not be stained by
the crimes of the dead.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.315
Not when life and
peace are so fragile.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.918
I forgive you.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.155
For the sake of your soul and
peace between our two nations.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.224
And my brother...

27:42.160 --> 27:43.894
...Will do the same.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.864
Let it be so.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.966
Let our feuds die
with our fathers.

27:53.738 --> 27:55.305
Arrest the duke.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.807
Catherine:
There's no need.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.045
Your uncle will
never betray anyone

28:01.047 --> 28:03.747
Or cause you
harm again.

28:06.451 --> 28:09.019
(carriage stops)

28:09.021 --> 28:11.088
Driver,
why are we stopping?

28:39.350 --> 28:41.385
Another stout for you?

28:41.387 --> 28:44.388
Oh, I can't drink
my dinner again tonight.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.391
I don't suppose
you could spare a tiny piece

28:47.393 --> 28:49.393
Of that game hen
I'm smelling?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.095
No cash, no bird.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.301
Man:
A heartrending sight.

28:57.303 --> 29:01.405
To see a lady of your beauty and
obvious charm seated here alone.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.907
Thank you.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.375
You have such
beautiful hair.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.211
It's like spun silk.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.480
Mmm.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.381
How much to run my
fingers through it?

29:13.051 --> 29:14.318
How m...
(clears throat)

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
I am a highborn lady.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.088
Swigging from a
tankard of cheap ale.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.456
Please, there's no
need for games.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.525
I can pay.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.329
Oh, dear, I was wrong.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.997
I'm terribly sorry.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.466
It's just... There seemed
a gentleness to you.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.834
And I-I'm not
from here.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.836
And, to be honest,
I-I'm lonely.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.138
Forgive me.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.073
All right.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.842
I suppose I can understand
your confusion.

29:38.844 --> 29:41.145
And I can well understand
feeling alone,

29:41.147 --> 29:42.546
But this is
no way to behave.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.815
You are so right.

29:51.489 --> 29:54.124
You're just going to look for
another prostitute, aren't you?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.993
Um... Maybe.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.995
Are you
a married man?

29:57.997 --> 29:59.863
Because seeking the services
of a prostitute,

29:59.865 --> 30:02.099
That counts as cheating,
you do know that.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.400
No, I'm not married at all.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.501
Widowed four years ago.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.570
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.842
Would you consider
yourself a kind man?

30:11.844 --> 30:14.845
Kind and generous.

30:14.847 --> 30:18.382
It-it shames me to
seek such comfort,

30:18.384 --> 30:21.051
To crave human
touch, but I do.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.188
I think
I can help you.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.191
Or rather I know someone
who can help.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.193
She's just upstairs.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.399
Louis, I am so sorry.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.067
For what?

30:37.069 --> 30:39.603
Manipulating me or believing me
capable of such deception?

30:39.605 --> 30:41.171
Poisoning your family,

30:41.173 --> 30:43.173
Then working beside you,
fighting beside you.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.175
I needed to keep you
here to clear your name,

30:45.177 --> 30:46.910
If it could be cleared.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.912
Louis, there was such
evidence against you.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.415
You lied to me.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.351
Humiliated me, letting me
believe that...

30:54.353 --> 30:58.222
You push me away, time and
again, then pull me towards you.

30:58.224 --> 31:01.225
Don't... Don't you understand?

31:01.227 --> 31:02.593
I love you.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.094
What I wrote
in that letter--

31:04.096 --> 31:05.462
Do you think it was
an impulse?

31:05.464 --> 31:06.463
A... A passing infatuation?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.532
It was the truth.

31:10.001 --> 31:11.935
Still is the truth.

31:26.117 --> 31:27.918
Revealing our grudge against
bash in front of the king?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.187
Couldn't just stand there,
accused by him and say nothing.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.123
You should've chosen your
words more carefully.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.460
Or perhaps you chose
just the right ones?

31:38.663 --> 31:40.664
Did you bring our brother's
death to light to protect

31:40.666 --> 31:42.165
That half-blood bastard?

31:42.167 --> 31:45.269
I was trying to protect you...
And me.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.403
To stop you enacting
on a vendetta

31:46.405 --> 31:47.671
That'll get us both killed.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.673
You do not make my
decisions for me.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.308
If anything happens to bash now,
you and I are

31:51.310 --> 31:53.143
First in line
for the executioner.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.279
I can gut that bastard
without killing him.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.481
I'll make him suffer.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.549
Another way.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.123
Gisela:
It's rare to find a girl

32:06.125 --> 32:09.126
For hire with such highly placed
friends at french court.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.128
I have been lucky.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.963
I get along with people.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.932
Still, the position
will be challenging.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.967
The count and I travel
a great deal.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.536
And even when we are home...

32:19.538 --> 32:22.005
Well, hungary is
far from France.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.941
I'm eager to learn.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.410
I've heard it
to be an exotic place.

32:26.412 --> 32:29.012
Hmm. You are a find.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.381
Now, you'd be socializing
with foreigners...

32:31.383 --> 32:34.084
Sharlene:
No, I will see her now!

32:34.086 --> 32:36.353
Greer.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.021
I was surprised when the
innkeep said you were here.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.423
Sharlene, what happened
to your...?

32:39.425 --> 32:41.024
My hair? You!

32:41.026 --> 32:42.392
You did this to me!

32:42.394 --> 32:44.261
That john you sent up?
He's a gentleman,

32:44.263 --> 32:45.295
You said. Kind...

32:45.297 --> 32:47.497
Do you know this woman?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.032
Well, he was kind right
up until I nodded off.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.300
I think he slipped
something in my drink.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.702
And when I woke up,

32:51.704 --> 32:54.104
He chopped off my hair!
Oh, sharlene, no.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.405
He's probably off somewhere,
petting it now,

32:55.407 --> 32:56.406
The pervert!

32:56.408 --> 32:58.175
Is your friend a prostitute?

32:58.177 --> 32:59.376
Well, I was!

32:59.378 --> 33:01.044
Till this one took
my last chance

33:01.046 --> 33:02.312
At making a living!

33:02.314 --> 33:03.580
I can't afford a wig!

33:03.582 --> 33:05.248
And I'm pretty sure the market

33:05.250 --> 33:07.050
For a shorn whore
is quite miniscule!

33:07.052 --> 33:09.453
You're worse than my last pimp!

33:09.455 --> 33:11.054
You have ruined me!

33:11.056 --> 33:12.255
(door closes)

33:12.257 --> 33:13.991
I think you are both ruined.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.459
But apparently you
already have a profession.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.194
No, I swear!

33:17.196 --> 33:18.695
Please, leave.

33:23.401 --> 33:26.737
I am informing my mother
of the duke's fate.

33:26.739 --> 33:30.207
I wonder if she'll be surprised.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.209
It was power, not family

33:32.211 --> 33:33.210
That ever moved my uncle.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.078
I keep thinking

33:35.080 --> 33:36.613
That if we discovered
the poison...

33:36.615 --> 33:38.749
You wouldn't have had to
have kill your father.

33:38.751 --> 33:41.151
You would've been spared.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.223
(horse neighs outside)

33:46.225 --> 33:48.225
Perhaps we can salvage the match

33:48.227 --> 33:49.760
Between condÃ© and lola.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.762
No.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.263
I think we should step back.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.631
Instead of trying
to force things.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.099
Thinking that they'll

33:56.101 --> 33:58.235
Protect us or save us
from anything.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.537
We can't force our own hearts.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.372
Why would we try
to force others?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.574
There's no point
in it anymore.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.743
It's time to let our hearts
to go where they will.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.279
It's the first time
I've heard you talk

34:09.281 --> 34:11.348
About your heart and the future.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.285
What's changed?

34:16.654 --> 34:19.723
Time, I suppose.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.327
Time that has brought your heart

34:24.329 --> 34:27.330
No closer to mine.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.099
You say that I can be free.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.435
Open to another.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.737
But without you, my heart is

34:33.739 --> 34:36.706
As closed as tight as a fist.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.247
(door creaks open)

34:44.249 --> 34:45.549
(door slams)

34:50.321 --> 34:51.822
You've heard, I assume?

34:51.824 --> 34:54.357
About the duke of guise? Yes.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.293
Brutal way to die.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.395
Especially as he was innocent.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.433
A ransom befitting a prince.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.168
Oh, a bargain.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.871
Considering I warned you
that catherine was circling.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.273
And provided you
with a scapegoat

35:10.275 --> 35:11.475
To shoulder the blame.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.176
And to die for you.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.846
Ah, the poisoner
frederic was dead.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.581
Mm.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.316
What led you to me?

35:19.318 --> 35:21.151
The proprietor of the
establishment frederic fell

35:21.153 --> 35:24.321
Into such debt with is a
close acquaintance of mine.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.890
Willing to open up his
books to me for a price.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.558
But I never paid your friend.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.328
No. You were clever.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.196
I had to rely on my
bankers to unearth

35:33.198 --> 35:35.432
The trail that led back to you.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.501
Or rather, the duke of guise,

35:37.503 --> 35:39.436
Once the bankers

35:39.438 --> 35:41.471
Had finished with him.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.174
And the final payment?

35:44.176 --> 35:46.743
The deed you had manufactured
from the duke?

35:46.745 --> 35:48.345
It will bear up under scrutiny?

35:48.347 --> 35:50.213
Oh, yes.

35:50.215 --> 35:53.517
I have an excess
of expertise in that area.

35:53.519 --> 35:57.454
After all, how does one acquire
so much land to lose?

35:58.756 --> 36:02.759
So, you're clever and grasping.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.795
What's to stop you
from blackmailing me?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.831
You poisoned a king

36:07.833 --> 36:09.466
And a queen.

36:09.468 --> 36:12.169
And now I've helped
you get away with it.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.772
We each hold a noose
for the other.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.841
And my gold?

36:17.843 --> 36:19.276
What will you do with that?

36:19.278 --> 36:20.644
Buy back the lands you've lost?

36:20.646 --> 36:21.745
What gold?

36:21.747 --> 36:24.414
I am but a penniless,

36:24.416 --> 36:26.383
Disgraced lord.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.717
No concern to anyone.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.187
Well, they won't
see you coming, will they?

36:30.189 --> 36:33.223
Not this time.

36:40.598 --> 36:41.531
Here it is then.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.532
What's this?

36:42.534 --> 36:43.567
Your cut.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.435
And I don't want you sending

36:45.437 --> 36:46.703
Anyone after me for it later.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.371
Sharlene, you have it all wrong!

36:48.373 --> 36:49.773
Wait, no!

36:50.608 --> 36:51.942
No...

36:51.944 --> 36:53.476
No, I...

36:53.478 --> 36:55.946
So, you're working hens then?

36:55.948 --> 36:57.414
You got your coin.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.816
You got your bird.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.830
(door closes)

37:13.832 --> 37:16.299
Oh, you're still here?

37:16.301 --> 37:17.434
I thought you
were going home.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.536
You framed the duke, didn't you?

37:19.538 --> 37:20.670
Somehow.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.572
You're cleared, louis.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.407
I admit, it took me a moment
to piece it together.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.575
And then I remembered.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.677
I confided in you
about frederic.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.778
How torn I was

37:28.780 --> 37:30.547
Refusing to help him.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.549
And in doing so,
I had no idea

37:32.551 --> 37:34.951
I gave you the perfect weapon
against henry.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.519
Louis, let it go.
I stood

37:36.521 --> 37:37.921
Before my king and queen

37:37.923 --> 37:39.723
And told them we were innocent.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.791
You made me a liar,
an accomplice in your treason.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.693
Do you forget how much
marcus suffered?

37:43.695 --> 37:46.596
How much you loved him
as a boy?

37:46.598 --> 37:47.998
He carried you on his shoulders.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.532
Taught you how to hunt,
how to shoot.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.302
Protected you from our father.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.536
Took blows for you,
died betrayed.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.405
And you judge me

37:55.407 --> 37:56.539
For avenging him?

37:56.541 --> 37:57.841
What has this place done to you?

37:57.843 --> 38:00.610
You did this to me.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.379
You are my brother.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.414
And I will never
trust you again.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.750
Did you know the poison

38:06.752 --> 38:09.352
Would make henry go mad?

38:09.354 --> 38:12.055
Well, I knew it was slow acting.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.690
Nearly impossible to trace.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.058
I chose it because I wanted

38:15.060 --> 38:16.626
Henry to suffer.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.961
And then die.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.629
I admit.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.631
I enjoyed the reports
of his madness.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.767
Knowing I was the cause.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.302
And what's his legacy?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.636
How is he remembered?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.572
As a monster and a butcher,

38:29.574 --> 38:31.708
Which is exactly what he was.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.510
I righted the scales.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.912
Restored the balance
between our families.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.914
So we can look them in the eye,
the valois,

38:37.916 --> 38:40.884
And deal with them as equals.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.734
Strawberries in snow.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.069
â™ª I see you under

38:59.071 --> 39:01.604
â™ª blue skies

39:01.606 --> 39:04.808
â™ª I need a little sunshine...

39:04.810 --> 39:06.543
Francis.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.511
Uh, the baby's sleeping, but...

39:08.513 --> 39:09.779
I was looking for you.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.750
You said that you missed
our friendship,

39:13.752 --> 39:16.453
Our closeness.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.722
It was a loss for me, too.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.924
I'd like us to
be close again.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.926
Friends.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.128
(baby groans)

39:25.130 --> 39:26.629
Family, as it were.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.132
I'd like that.

39:29.134 --> 39:33.470
â™ª I just want
to hold your hand â™ª

39:33.472 --> 39:36.673
â™ª oh, you know
when you're alone â™ª

39:36.675 --> 39:39.943
â™ª I'm holding on

39:39.945 --> 39:41.745
â™ª oh, oh

39:41.747 --> 39:43.146
(quiet laugh)

39:43.148 --> 39:45.081
â™ª oh, you know when you're...

39:45.083 --> 39:46.516
That feeling.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.986
Your heart opening
alongside his hand.

39:49.988 --> 39:53.089
Isn't it extraordinary?

39:53.091 --> 39:56.726
Yes, it is.

39:56.728 --> 40:00.463
â™ª your soul...

40:03.067 --> 40:04.934
Mary.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.804
Please, let me speak.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.973
I knew I was taking
advantage of you,

40:09.975 --> 40:11.975
Your regard for me, and you
deserve better than that.

40:11.977 --> 40:14.711
It's done now.
No need to apologize again.

40:14.713 --> 40:17.113
I am sorry, but I'm
not here to apologize.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.150
I'm here to tell you the truth.

40:20.152 --> 40:22.185
Which I suppose I already did.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.020
Even before I even realized it.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.522
When I told you to call

40:25.524 --> 40:27.957
Things off with lola.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.860
I didn't want to lose you.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.862
Not to another or to...

40:32.864 --> 40:35.432
To the charges of treason.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.935
I imagined you dead.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.005
That loss and your
betrayal pained me

40:42.007 --> 40:43.973
More than they should
pain a married woman.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.609
But you're not really a married
woman anymore, are you?

40:46.611 --> 40:49.012
I am, louis.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.681
In the eyes of the
church and the world,

40:51.683 --> 40:53.550
I am francis's wife.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.084
And I will never do anything

40:55.086 --> 40:58.021
To compromise my duty as queen.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.791
I don't have the same
freedom as a man or a king

41:01.793 --> 41:04.093
To stray beyond my marriage.

41:04.095 --> 41:07.497
And given what I've
been through, I have

41:07.499 --> 41:08.665
Nothing to offer you, louis.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.100
I hear you.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.635
I do.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.172
But of all the reasons
you expound

41:16.174 --> 41:17.540
Of why we can't be together,

41:17.542 --> 41:18.975
None are of the heart.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.946
I have to fight every instinct

41:22.948 --> 41:24.647
I have pulling me toward you.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.849
When I'm near you,

41:25.851 --> 41:27.951
I am aware
of every breath you take.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.686
And when I'm away,

41:29.688 --> 41:32.856
Even the wind in the trees
reminds me of you.

41:32.858 --> 41:36.059
â™ª your soul...

41:36.061 --> 41:38.661
You will be the death of me.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.830
And I of you.
