02:33.387 --> 02:35.389
When I returned
to Baker Street

02:35.522 --> 02:38.625
from a short holiday
in the spring of 1891,

02:38.725 --> 02:42.196
I had seen little of Holmes
for some time.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.778
I saw in the papers
that he had been engaged

02:57.878 --> 03:01.315
by the French government upon
a matter of supreme importance

03:01.448 --> 03:04.117
but I could hardly foresee
that it would have

03:04.218 --> 03:06.386
so violent
a consequence.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.656
It lies with me now
to tell for the first time

03:09.756 --> 03:13.227
what took place between
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

03:13.360 --> 03:18.832
and Professor Moriarity
in that fateful year.

03:18.966 --> 03:23.203
Ah, Mrs. Hudson
has Mr. Holmes returned?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.072
Oh, he has indeed.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.406
He came in early.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.442
Must have been
before 7:00.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.244
"Morning Mrs. Hudson"
he says,

03:30.344 --> 03:32.713
"Have you anything nice
for my breakfast?"

03:32.813 --> 03:35.148
as if he hadn't been away
for four months.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.385
You could have knocked me down
with a feather.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.154
And he's gone
out again I take it?

03:41.255 --> 03:44.892
Yes, yes he had his breakfast
and then he went out again

03:44.992 --> 03:47.361
just after
his visitor left.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.930
Visitor?

03:50.030 --> 03:53.200
An elderly
gentleman.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.969
They had words.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.507
I didn't like the look of him,
not at all I didn't.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.877
He had a face like, like
the wrath of God

04:03.977 --> 04:06.313
or should I say
the devil.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.048
Indeed.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.485
Should we open a bottle
of the best claret

04:11.585 --> 04:14.188
to celebrate
Mr. Holmes' return?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.956
Why not?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.591
Very good.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.028
Thank you,
Mrs. Hudson.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.398
I learned later that Holmes
had survived three attempts

04:24.498 --> 04:26.767
on his life
that very day.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.303
But as I waited for him
to reappear

04:29.403 --> 04:33.841
Baker Street looked to me
as safe and secure as ever.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.161
Holmes you...

05:29.263 --> 05:30.998
Wait, wait.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.014
What is it?

05:47.114 --> 05:51.451
Air guns, a rather special
air gun in fact.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.223
Watson would you have
any objection to drawing

05:56.323 --> 05:59.993
the blinds casually as if
you were alone in this room?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.785
Watson I think you know me
well enough to understand

06:24.885 --> 06:27.855
that I am by no means
a nervous man.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.692
But it is stupidity
rather than courage

06:31.792 --> 06:35.295
to refuse to recognize danger
when it is close upon you.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.138
Damn!

06:49.142 --> 06:51.979
Watson,
might I have a match?

06:56.350 --> 06:57.684
Holmes,
you're hurt.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.786
Scratches, nothing,
nothing to signify.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.563
You don't look well
Holmes.

07:09.663 --> 07:15.102
Well I have been using myself
rather too freely.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.971
I have been somewhat
pressed but late.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.440
How pressed?

07:20.541 --> 07:23.810
Well as I am unable to leave
this room until after dark

07:23.911 --> 07:26.747
and then most likely
on the way that I came,

07:26.847 --> 07:29.583
we do have some time
on our hands.

07:29.683 --> 07:33.921
Also I owe you an explanation
for my unceremonious departure

07:34.021 --> 07:36.156
the last time
that we met.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.358
I'll take some notes
if I may?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.394
Oh, by all means.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.229
This case...

07:42.329 --> 07:45.299
This case,
it is unique

07:45.432 --> 07:49.369
in the annuals
of crime.

07:49.503 --> 07:55.442
You will recall that it was
a cold morning early in the year

07:55.576 --> 07:57.211
when I last left
Baker Street.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.317
I had no idea where I was going
or who my client was.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.918
All I knew was
that it was important

08:05.052 --> 08:06.320
and abroad.

08:06.420 --> 08:10.157
My destination was the museum
and the Louve was in Paris

08:10.257 --> 08:14.228
and my client none less
than the French government.

08:22.336 --> 08:27.274
Surely this Louve is near
to the very heart of France.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.844
It was here that
the great Musele held court

08:30.944 --> 08:33.547
and here that
Napoleon Bonaparte

08:33.647 --> 08:35.716
was married to
the Archduchess Madam

08:35.849 --> 08:37.583
Marie Louise of Austria.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.255
Indeed it is a history lesson
in stone.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.358
And now this gallery
contains our finest paintings.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.862
Gentlemen,
shall we come to the point?

08:48.962 --> 08:52.866
I presume the Mona Lisa
has been stolen.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.307
When I see two hooks
and the place where

09:00.407 --> 09:03.076
the Mona Lisa used to hang
and then this talk

09:03.177 --> 09:06.213
of...
and scandal.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.787
Yes, now I begin to understand
the delicacy of the matter.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.661
The Louve is closed on Mondays
for maintenance.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.963
The fact that the Mona Lisa
was not hanging

09:23.063 --> 09:25.032
in her usual place was no doubt
due to the fact

09:25.165 --> 09:27.501
that she was in
the photographic studio.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.938
It was only later in the day
that a workman found the frame

09:31.038 --> 09:36.109
in a little storeroom
under the salon care.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.711
We put the glass
over the painting

09:37.845 --> 09:39.213
only a month ago.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.781
We feared an acid attack,
there was such a one

09:40.914 --> 09:42.182
in Florence recently.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.483
How very fortunate.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.351
Pardon?

09:44.451 --> 09:46.353
Two good
thumb prints.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.898
Many artists come here
to make copies of the paintings.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.772
This one seems
well done.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.442
Yes, that artist
is particularly clever

10:08.575 --> 10:10.944
and makes a good living
from his copying.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.980
I should like
to meet him sometime.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.568
To make a bad copy
is very easy but a good one,

10:34.668 --> 10:37.704
it takes
years of practice.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.040
For instance De Vinci

10:40.140 --> 10:44.011
used Italian popular wood
to paint on.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.713
It is very difficult
to find.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.217
To match the original color,
nearly impossible.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.754
It is, uh, full mature,
the smooth blended tones,

10:53.854 --> 10:57.691
very subtle
and his brushwork

10:57.791 --> 10:59.860
is left-handed.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.964
The crack work,
this fine network

11:04.097 --> 11:09.403
of cracks,
left, ah.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.672
that is the most difficult
to achieve of all.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.507
And you can
achieve it?

11:13.607 --> 11:14.808
How?

11:14.908 --> 11:17.477
That is my secret.

11:17.611 --> 11:20.280
It seems to me
that this is something

11:20.380 --> 11:22.549
near to a
legitimate forgery.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.052
No, no, no
because the copies must never

11:25.152 --> 11:27.287
be the same size
as the original.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.023
And, and who would buy
one of my copies as the original

11:30.123 --> 11:33.093
when the real Mona Lisa
is in the Louve.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.661
But if by chance
the Mona Lisa

11:34.761 --> 11:36.730
is no longer
in the Louve?

11:36.864 --> 11:39.299
But of course
you are joking Messier.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.310
Happily the French police
are well ahead of the British

11:50.410 --> 11:52.613
when it comes to
fingerprints.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.883
The great Bantion himself
was kind enough to refer

11:55.983 --> 11:59.253
to my little pamphlet
on the subject as his bible.

11:59.353 --> 12:02.489
As I suspected,
our man had been involved

12:02.589 --> 12:06.760
in petty crime in the past,
a Spaniard named Mendosa.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.330
There, there
is your thief.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.200
Not a pleasant
specimen.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.204
Mr. Holmes,
France owes you a great debt.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.673
We have not got the man
and more important,

12:19.773 --> 12:21.942
the painting.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.111
But he must
be arrested immediately.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.046
He may have already
sold it.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.915
No, no, gentlemen
it is my belief

12:28.015 --> 12:30.317
that the painting
is still in Mendosa's keeping.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.387
He is only a pawn
in a much bigger game.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.290
This robbery
has been carefully planned

12:36.390 --> 12:39.593
over months, even years
by a master criminal.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.562
But what professional
criminal would want

12:41.662 --> 12:43.363
to own
the Mona Lisa?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.431
That is madness.

12:44.565 --> 12:45.933
He can't sell it.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.569
I believe the master criminal
is not interested

12:48.702 --> 12:49.736
in the original,

12:49.870 --> 12:54.208
if he can pass off
the forgeries as originals

12:54.308 --> 12:56.210
for the same price.

12:56.310 --> 13:00.280
Gentlemen we must
alarm Mendosa,

13:00.414 --> 13:04.017
get him on the move
so he leads us

13:04.117 --> 13:06.153
to the center
of the web.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.754
But how?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.924
First we must announce
to the world

13:11.058 --> 13:13.293
that the painting
has been stolen.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.895
Oh,
but that would create

13:15.028 --> 13:17.464
a great scandal both myself
and the director of...

13:17.564 --> 13:19.566
Minister,
please if I may explain.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.169
It would be announced
that owing to the brilliant

13:22.302 --> 13:26.340
and tireless efforts of
yourself and the director,

13:26.473 --> 13:30.177
that the criminal
is about to be arrested.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.395
Mr. Holmes, we must
arrest him now.

13:48.529 --> 13:50.030
No.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.971
Now!

14:36.743 --> 14:39.746
Holmes, I understand that
the recovery of the original

14:39.880 --> 14:42.416
would make it impossible
for the thieves to sell

14:42.549 --> 14:45.252
any copies however excellent
those copies were,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.589
but did you have any clue
to the identity

14:48.689 --> 14:50.691
of the mastermind behind
the whole scheme?

14:50.824 --> 14:53.193
I was satisfied
that I had recognized one of

14:53.293 --> 14:55.829
Professor Moriarity's
agents.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.631
Moriarity?

15:21.054 --> 15:25.092
Notice the subtle modeling
of the features,

15:25.225 --> 15:27.394
beautiful hands,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
mood,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.832
that smile.

15:31.932 --> 15:37.371
As Walter Payton described her,
the head upon which all the ends

15:37.471 --> 15:39.540
of the world
are common.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.842
The eyelids
are a little weary.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.179
No one else has ever had
the genius to paint this masterpiece

15:45.279 --> 15:46.980
except De Vinci.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.950
But if you look at
the paint work sir.

15:50.050 --> 15:54.288
Leonard's signature at large,
the brush work,

15:54.388 --> 15:59.293
the bloom,
the technique.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.361
Will you
excuse me?

16:07.134 --> 16:10.470
I would say without hesitation
that the general opinion

16:10.571 --> 16:13.273
of the art world
is that this

16:13.373 --> 16:16.243
is the greatest portrait
ever painted.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.603
I very much regret
to have to tell you sir

16:42.703 --> 16:46.773
that this painting
is no longer for sale.

16:46.907 --> 16:49.076
I don't understand
Professor.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.545
I mean,
the price maybe?

16:51.645 --> 16:54.014
Well now look,
I'll reconsider.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.851
I'll give you a cool
four million and how's that?

16:57.951 --> 17:00.420
I'm sorry
Mr. Walker,

17:00.554 --> 17:04.657
the painting is no
longer for sale.

17:04.758 --> 17:08.896
Hey,
what you guys up to?

17:08.996 --> 17:11.031
Take your hands off me
you nick!

17:11.165 --> 17:13.133
Thanks for nothing.

17:19.006 --> 17:22.442
That wretched Holmes
has recovered the original.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.045
These are worthless.

17:25.179 --> 17:27.079
Destroy them,

17:27.181 --> 17:28.649
burn them.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.987
Do it
yourself,

17:34.121 --> 17:36.023
and let no one else
see you.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.058
Yes,
Professor Moriarity.

18:14.728 --> 18:16.530
I must
congratulate you, Holmes.

18:16.630 --> 18:18.832
Such an honor
and so well deserved.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.334
There was no
great problem.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.503
The case practically
solved itself.

18:22.636 --> 18:26.440
I hear you had a visitor
this morning.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.774
Ow!!!

18:30.177 --> 18:32.346
I had not been back
in Baker Street

18:32.446 --> 18:33.814
more than
half an hour when...

18:33.914 --> 18:36.350
But you cannot
go up there sir!

18:57.938 --> 19:01.942
You have less
frontal development

19:02.075 --> 19:04.111
than I should have
expected.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.648
It's a dangerous habit,
a finger loaded firearms

19:07.748 --> 19:09.283
in the pocket of one's
dressing gown.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.243
You evidentially
don't know me.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.313
On the contrary I think it's
fairly evident that I do.

19:39.413 --> 19:44.885
I can spare you five minutes
if you have anything to say.

19:45.018 --> 19:50.390
All that I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

19:50.491 --> 19:54.795
And possibly my answer
has already crossed yours.

19:54.895 --> 19:56.396
You stand fast?

19:56.530 --> 19:58.232
Absolutely.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.913
You frustrated me
in the affair

20:13.013 --> 20:14.882
of the French gold.

20:14.982 --> 20:18.986
So it was you behind
the Red Headed League.

20:19.119 --> 20:23.457
A very ingenious
and welcome tried idea.

20:23.557 --> 20:26.927
High praise
from you.

20:27.027 --> 20:32.499
You crossed my path
first on the 4th of January.

20:32.633 --> 20:35.502
By the middle of February
I was seriously inconvenienced

20:35.602 --> 20:37.471
by you and at
the end of March

20:37.571 --> 20:40.107
I was absolutely
hampered in my plans.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.343
And now with this last business
in France you have placed me

20:43.477 --> 20:46.213
in such a position
by your continual persecution

20:46.313 --> 20:49.683
that I am in positive danger
of losing my liberty.

20:53.287 --> 20:58.525
The situation is becoming
an impossible one.

20:58.625 --> 21:02.162
Have you any suggestion
to make?

21:02.296 --> 21:06.733
You must drop it
Mr. Holmes.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.703
You really must
you know.

21:09.803 --> 21:12.139
And what if
I refuse?

21:12.239 --> 21:15.209
I'm quite sure that a man
of your intelligence

21:15.309 --> 21:19.179
will see that there can be
but one outcome to this affair.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.915
It is necessary
that you should withdraw.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.318
You have worked things
in such a fashion

21:24.418 --> 21:27.421
that we have only
one resource left.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.524
It has been an intellectual
treat to me to see

21:30.657 --> 21:33.627
the way in which
you grappled with this matter.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.698
But I say unaffectedly
that it would be a grief to me

21:37.831 --> 21:41.368
to be forced to take
an extreme measure.

21:41.502 --> 21:47.174
Oh, you smile sir

21:47.274 --> 21:50.010
but it really would
I do assure you.

21:50.110 --> 21:52.279
Danger is part of
my trade.

21:52.379 --> 21:55.782
This is not danger.

21:55.883 --> 21:58.152
It is inevitable
destruction.

21:58.252 --> 22:00.554
You stand in the way
not merely of an individual

22:00.654 --> 22:03.524
but of a mighty organization,
the full extent of which

22:03.624 --> 22:06.426
even you with all your
cleverness have been

22:06.527 --> 22:08.695
unable to realize.

22:08.795 --> 22:13.300
You must stand clear Mr. Holmes
or be trouble under foot.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.204
You know I'm afraid
that in the pleasure

22:17.304 --> 22:20.107
of this conversation
I am neglecting business

22:20.207 --> 22:23.911
of importance
which awaits me elsewhere.

22:28.382 --> 22:31.785
Well, well,
it seems a pity

22:31.885 --> 22:36.690
but I've
done what I could.

22:49.937 --> 22:53.607
This is a duel
between you and me Mr. Holmes.

22:53.707 --> 22:57.845
You hope to place
me in the dark.

22:57.945 --> 23:00.047
You hope
to beat me.

23:00.180 --> 23:04.618
If you are clever enough
to bring destruction on me,

23:04.718 --> 23:11.325
rest assured
I shall do as much for you.

23:18.198 --> 23:22.202
You have paid me
several compliments,

23:22.336 --> 23:24.338
Mr. Moriarity.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.875
Let me pay you one
in return when I say that if

23:27.975 --> 23:30.811
I were assured of
the former eventuality

23:30.911 --> 23:34.348
I would, in the interests
of the public,

23:34.481 --> 23:38.185
cheerfully accept
the later.

23:38.285 --> 23:44.825
I can promise you the one
but not the other.

24:21.895 --> 24:25.232
He is the Napoleon
of crime Watson.

24:25.332 --> 24:27.301
For years
I have endeavored

24:27.434 --> 24:30.304
to break through
the veil which shrouded him

24:30.404 --> 24:35.242
and at last
I have seized a thread

24:35.342 --> 24:40.514
and followed it
to Moriarity himself.

24:40.614 --> 24:45.085
And now I'm ready
to close on him.

24:45.219 --> 24:47.721
If he doesn't
close upon you first.

24:54.394 --> 24:59.299
On Monday next,
matters will be right

24:59.399 --> 25:03.270
but the Professor
and all the principal members

25:03.370 --> 25:06.773
of his gang will be
in the hands of the police.

25:06.874 --> 25:12.880
Then will come the greatest
criminal trial of the century,

25:13.013 --> 25:14.982
the clearing up of
over 40 mysteries

25:15.082 --> 25:17.551
and the room
full of them.

25:17.651 --> 25:22.523
I cannot do better
than to get away

25:22.623 --> 25:24.825
for the few
remaining days.

25:24.925 --> 25:27.628
It would give me great pleasure
Watson if you would come

25:27.728 --> 25:29.329
onto the continent
with me.

25:29.463 --> 25:30.931
The continent?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.333
I'd be delighted Holmes,
but where?

25:33.433 --> 25:34.368
Anywhere.

25:34.468 --> 25:36.003
It's all
the same to me.

25:36.136 --> 25:38.238
Yes, but won't
we have to dispose of

25:38.372 --> 25:40.207
Professor Moriarity
first?

25:40.307 --> 25:44.278
It seems to me that we're
under siege in this very room.

25:44.411 --> 25:48.849
And that reminds me
I must be on my way.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.984
Won't you
stay the night?

25:51.118 --> 25:53.921
No, it's too dangerous for you
if I stay here.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.398
I will leave the way I came
and find lodgings

26:04.531 --> 26:06.066
with my brother
Mycroft.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.768
We start
tomorrow morning.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.236
Tomorrow morning?

26:09.336 --> 26:11.538
Oh, yes,
it is most necessary.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.374
Now here are your instructions
and I beg of you

26:14.475 --> 26:16.376
to follow them
to the letter.

26:16.477 --> 26:19.413
We are now playing
a double-handed game with me,

26:19.513 --> 26:21.715
Watson against
the most powerful syndicate

26:21.815 --> 26:23.484
of criminals
in Europe.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.152
You will dispatch
whatever luggage

26:25.285 --> 26:27.654
you intend to take by
a trusted messenger unaddressed

26:27.754 --> 26:29.623
at the Victoria Station
tonight.

26:29.723 --> 26:32.726
In the morning you will send
Mrs. Hudson for a handsome cab,

26:32.860 --> 26:35.496
desiring her
not to take the first

26:35.596 --> 26:38.799
or second which may
present itself.

26:38.899 --> 26:44.138
You will drive to the Strand end of La Famules,

26:44.238 --> 26:46.440
handing the address
to the cabman

26:46.540 --> 26:49.643
but with a request
that he will not throw it away.

27:09.029 --> 27:12.199
Have your fare ready
and the instant that your cab

27:12.299 --> 27:16.236
stops move speedily through
the muse and time yourself

27:16.370 --> 27:20.674
to reach the other end at
exactly a quarter past 9:00

27:20.774 --> 27:24.211
where you will find a small
broom waiting close to the curb

27:24.344 --> 27:27.281
driven by a fellow
with a heavy black coat,

27:27.381 --> 27:29.683
tipped at the collar
with red.

27:29.783 --> 27:33.020
Into this you will stay
and you will reach Victoria

27:33.120 --> 27:35.689
in time for
the continental express.

27:48.869 --> 27:51.572
Excuse me sir, I
wonder if you speak Italian.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.006
No,
I'm afraid not.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.943
I'm looking for the gentleman
who reserved this compartment.

27:56.043 --> 27:57.110
Not a sign of him
sir.

27:57.244 --> 27:59.313
If you're traveling
you better get aboard.

28:40.287 --> 28:42.623
My dear Watson
you haven't even condescended

28:42.723 --> 28:45.459
to say good morning
to me.

28:50.464 --> 28:53.634
Good heavens Holmes,
how you startled me.

28:53.734 --> 28:57.871
It is still necessary
to take every precaution.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.729
I did rather fine,
Watson.

29:48.355 --> 29:51.325
I see that this express runs
in connection with the boat

29:51.458 --> 29:54.761
so I think we've shaken off
Moriarity very effectively.

29:54.862 --> 29:58.365
Well what will
he do then?

29:58.499 --> 30:00.367
What I
should do.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.469
Engage a special
train.

30:02.603 --> 30:04.571
But he'll arrive
too late.

30:04.671 --> 30:07.641
You'll observe from your
Bradshaw that this train

30:07.741 --> 30:10.477
stops at Canterbury
and again at the boat.

30:10.577 --> 30:12.613
Moriarity will
catch us there.

30:12.746 --> 30:16.617
Good heavens anybody would think
that we were the criminals.

30:16.717 --> 30:19.419
Let's arrest him
as soon as he arrives.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.456
No, that would ruin
everything.

30:22.556 --> 30:25.759
If we should catch the big fish
then the smaller

30:25.859 --> 30:28.428
would dart right and left
out of the net.

30:28.562 --> 30:31.498
No, no,
and the rest is invisible.

30:31.598 --> 30:34.134
Well what then?

30:34.268 --> 30:38.272
We shall
get ours at Canterbury.

30:55.989 --> 30:58.358
But Holmes
our luggage.

30:58.459 --> 31:01.862
We must give Moriarity
something to follow.

31:01.962 --> 31:03.864
What will
we do?

31:03.964 --> 31:06.533
We shall go
across country.

31:15.442 --> 31:19.279
Here we are Holmes, Bradshaw
shouldn't let you down.

31:19.379 --> 31:23.317
From Ashford Junction
we can take a 1:00 slow train

31:23.450 --> 31:26.420
to Hastings,
then onto the dear old

31:26.520 --> 31:30.691
London Brighton
and South Coast line,

31:30.791 --> 31:34.928
Bax Hill on to Lewis non-stop,
then onto New Haven,

31:35.028 --> 31:37.131
evening boat
to Vienna.

31:37.264 --> 31:39.800
I think we've got time
for an early lunch.

31:45.506 --> 31:47.307
So soon.

32:13.367 --> 32:18.272
There are limits you see
to even our friend's intelligence.

32:18.372 --> 32:22.643
And now Watson,
we shall treat ourselves

32:22.743 --> 32:26.747
for a couple of carpet bags,
encourage the manufacturers,

32:26.880 --> 32:30.717
the countries through which
we travel and make our way

32:30.818 --> 32:33.353
at leisure
into Switzerland

32:33.487 --> 32:36.924
via Brussels,
Luxemberg...

32:37.057 --> 32:41.261
It fell out as Sherlock Holmes
had predicted.

32:41.361 --> 32:44.264
We stayed two nights
in Brussels,

32:44.364 --> 32:47.734
then began to make our
leisurely way southeast.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.171
For a charming week we
progressed towards the Alps.

33:17.564 --> 33:19.666
What do you
think?

33:19.800 --> 33:23.170
A common enough occurrence
in the mountains.

33:55.302 --> 34:00.240
Ah, nothing like drinking
the wine where it's grown.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.147
Hmm.

34:11.685 --> 34:15.489
All gang safely secured,
only Moriarity escaped the net,

34:15.589 --> 34:17.357
signed Mycroft.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.793
He's given them
the slip.

34:20.893 --> 34:26.333
I think it would be better
if you were to

34:26.433 --> 34:28.534
return to England
Watson.

34:28.668 --> 34:30.971
Why?

34:31.071 --> 34:35.242
You will find me
a very dangerous companion now.

34:35.342 --> 34:40.614
Moriarity will devote
all his energies to taking his

34:40.714 --> 34:43.884
revenge upon me
and if I have a companion...

34:43.984 --> 34:46.219
Would you be
rid of me?

34:46.320 --> 34:49.790
No, except for the reasons
I've given.

34:49.922 --> 34:54.027
We've been in tight places
before together.

34:54.161 --> 34:57.397
Never as tight
as this one.

34:57.498 --> 35:00.667
I'm not leaving you
Holmes,

35:00.767 --> 35:03.770
not unless
you order me to go.

35:14.148 --> 35:16.116
I've never been
to Switzerland before

35:16.216 --> 35:19.620
but the beauty of the landscape
reminded me irresistibly

35:19.720 --> 35:21.889
of the northwest frontier
provinces of India.

35:22.022 --> 35:26.093
But in spite of the lovely
scenery all around us,

35:26.226 --> 35:29.062
it was clear to me
that never for one instant

35:29.163 --> 35:31.231
did Sherlock Holmes
forget the shadow

35:31.365 --> 35:32.966
that lay
across him.

36:27.855 --> 36:31.558
I could tell by his
sharp scrutiny of every face

36:31.658 --> 36:35.095
that he was well convinced
that go where we would

36:35.229 --> 36:38.132
we would not be clear
of the danger

36:38.232 --> 36:40.467
that was dogging
our footsteps.

37:23.343 --> 37:25.579
What was that?

37:47.668 --> 37:49.703
See anything?

37:49.837 --> 37:51.705
No, nothing.

37:51.805 --> 37:54.341
It's time
we went on our way.

37:54.475 --> 37:57.077
Hans,
we're on our way.

38:10.157 --> 38:13.861
At last we reached the heart
of the burnice overland

38:13.961 --> 38:16.063
and came to the village
of Mirengland

38:16.196 --> 38:18.732
where we put up
at the Englisher Hall

38:18.866 --> 38:21.869
then kept
by Peter Steiler the Elder.

38:35.983 --> 38:38.519
Uh, Steiler?

39:47.054 --> 39:52.226
The walk over to the hills
to Rosenlawry is very beautiful.

39:52.326 --> 39:56.263
You can stay the night
there and come back the next day

39:56.396 --> 39:59.766
but you must not on
any account miss

39:59.867 --> 40:03.737
the falls of Reichenbach
which is only a small detour.

40:03.837 --> 40:07.174
Uh, there it is.

40:37.704 --> 40:40.808
It is indeed
a fearful place.

40:40.941 --> 40:45.312
The torrent, swollen
by the melting glacier,

40:45.412 --> 40:50.350
plunges into a tremendous abyss
in which the spray rose up

40:50.484 --> 40:53.454
like the smoke
from a burning house.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.213
Herr, Dr. Watson.

41:21.515 --> 41:23.350
Herr, Dr. Watson.

41:23.450 --> 41:24.785
Yes?

41:24.885 --> 41:27.654
Herr Steiler told me
to give you this.

41:27.754 --> 41:29.790
It is very urgent.

41:29.923 --> 41:34.027
It seems an English woman
was taken to the hotel

41:34.161 --> 41:37.798
after we left on her way
to friends in Lucerne.

41:37.931 --> 41:39.833
She's had
a great hemorrhage.

41:39.933 --> 41:41.435
Tuberculoses.

41:41.568 --> 41:43.270
Oh, no doubt.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.506
It appears
she's dying.

41:45.639 --> 41:48.775
An English doctor
would be a great consolation.

41:48.909 --> 41:50.911
I'm afraid
I must go back Holmes.

41:51.044 --> 41:52.446
Of course.

41:52.546 --> 41:55.315
Steiler suggests
that this lad shows you the way

41:55.415 --> 41:58.418
to Rosenlawy
and I'll join you there later.

41:58.552 --> 41:59.486
A good plan.

42:26.313 --> 42:27.648
Hey!

43:12.359 --> 43:14.361
I trust
she's no worse.

43:23.704 --> 43:26.240
You didn't
write this?

43:26.373 --> 43:32.279
There is no sick
English woman at the hotel?

43:32.379 --> 43:36.183
No, but it has
the hotel mark.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.686
Of course, there was
a tall old Englishman

43:39.787 --> 43:41.755
who came here after
you had gone.

43:41.889 --> 43:43.157
He said...

44:54.261 --> 44:56.363
It was the sight
of the Alpine stalk

44:56.497 --> 44:59.967
that turned me cold
and sick.

45:00.100 --> 45:03.070
He had not gone
to Rosenlawy.

45:03.170 --> 45:07.241
I stood for a minute or two
to collect myself

45:07.374 --> 45:11.845
for I was dazed
with the horror of the thing.

45:11.979 --> 45:16.316
And then I began to think
of Holmes' own methods

45:16.416 --> 45:18.886
and to try
to practice them.

45:23.390 --> 45:25.392
Holmes,

45:29.029 --> 45:30.898
Holmes,

45:34.301 --> 45:36.770
Holmes.

46:08.602 --> 46:11.305
My Dear Watson,
I write these few lines

46:11.405 --> 46:14.341
through the courtesy
of Mr. Moriarity

46:14.441 --> 46:17.177
who awaits my convenience
for the final discussion

46:17.277 --> 46:19.847
of those questions
which lie between us.

46:19.980 --> 46:22.916
I'm pleased to think
that I shall be able

46:23.016 --> 46:26.220
to free society from any further
affects of his presence.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.956
Though I fear
that it is at a cost

46:29.089 --> 46:31.892
which will give pain
to my friends

46:31.992 --> 46:34.461
and especially
my dear Watson,

46:34.595 --> 46:37.464
to you.

46:40.534 --> 46:43.670
As you know, my career
had in any case

46:43.804 --> 46:45.939
reached a crisis.

46:46.073 --> 46:49.476
And no possible conclusion
to it could be more congenial

46:49.576 --> 46:51.645
to me
than this.

46:51.779 --> 46:55.215
Indeed if I may make
a full confession to you,

46:55.315 --> 46:57.751
I was convinced
that the letter...

46:57.851 --> 46:59.820
was a hoax.

46:59.953 --> 47:02.589
I made every disposition
of my property

47:02.723 --> 47:04.491
before leaving
England

47:04.591 --> 47:07.027
and handed it
to my brother Mycroft.

47:07.127 --> 47:10.030
Good bye
and good luck

47:10.130 --> 47:13.267
and believe me
to be my dear fellow,

47:13.400 --> 47:16.670
very sincerely yours,
Sherlock Holmes.

47:26.713 --> 47:29.616
In this situation
I have little doubt

47:29.716 --> 47:33.153
that a personal contest
between the two men

47:33.287 --> 47:35.689
ended as it could hardly
fail to end.

47:35.789 --> 47:38.425
Ahh!

49:23.297 --> 49:29.336
It's with a heavy heart
that I take up my pen

49:29.470 --> 49:35.409
to write these last words
in which I shall ever record

49:35.542 --> 49:38.745
singular gifts
by which my friend

49:38.846 --> 49:42.082
Mr. Sherlock Holmes
was distinguished.

49:42.182 --> 49:46.253
I shall
ever regard him

49:46.386 --> 49:49.756
as the best
and wisest man

49:49.857 --> 49:51.892
I have
ever known.
