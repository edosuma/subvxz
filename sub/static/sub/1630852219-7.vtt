01:29.240 --> 01:32.320
With that amount of good stuff,
no one can beat us.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.880
But we will attract attention.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.840
And Blue Blood?

01:40.960 --> 01:44.400
He had to prove himself, you said.
He did.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.920
He killed a stranger to keep you happy.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.160
You know that too.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.840
But now the real killing
will commence...

01:54.960 --> 02:00.120
and if they catch him or his men, I don't
know how he'll react. You don't either.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.240
Before he met me, he was a nobody.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.280
He hadn't done anything
like what he's doing now.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.400
He knows he'll be nowhere without us.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.320
But Enzo isn't stupid.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.760
That's why I chose him.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.760
I thought I could cross Avitabile...

02:27.880 --> 02:30.040
but he crossed me.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.360
Now I don't even trust myself anymore.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.080
But I trust you.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.600
Translated by: NederSubs

03:03.400 --> 03:05.320
I get you, Gennaro...

03:06.400 --> 03:09.360
but I don't understand
how you can trust Ciro.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.880
Only when they touch your family,
you show who you really are.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.960
And I saw Ciro di Marzio.
And he saw me.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.760
That's how it always has been.
And now he's more than family to me.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.880
You also left your family
to protect my dad, right?

03:40.000 --> 03:45.920
My father thought he had the best
soldier on his side, and he did.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.160
I saw something else as well:
It's not over yet.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.840
What do you mean?

03:55.960 --> 03:59.320
Let me know
when you arrive where you want to be.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.080
- Welcome.
- Hey, kid.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.320
- This is Ciro.
- Valerio, a pleasure.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.680
Enzo said good things about you.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.040
You know this is serious, right?

04:48.160 --> 04:52.080
Of course.
Come in, our host expects us.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.720
Wait a second.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.360
Before we go in,
I want to know where the stuff is going.

04:59.480 --> 05:04.280
The client is a partner in a large company
in London. That's where the coke is going.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.120
And how does he get it there?

05:06.240 --> 05:10.800
With a diplomatic passport.
His dad works at the Italian consulate.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.800
What do you get from it?

05:13.920 --> 05:17.720
Your respect and friendship,
and a share from the client.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.000
- Take me to him.
- Come with me.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.800
Antonello Rodi, a pleasure.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.880
I heard you're looking for something,
is that right?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.400
Valerio said I could talk to you
about a big order.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.400
- How much?
- 200,000.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.240
Where's the money?

06:03.240 --> 06:04.640
Antonello...

06:39.960 --> 06:42.000
We have to agree on a price.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.240
I heard 43,000 euros per kilo
is a reasonable price.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.560
Can I expect a volume discount?

06:49.680 --> 06:51.720
We're not going under 40.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.000
Then it will be five kilos,
that sounds good.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.320
When is the delivery?

07:00.800 --> 07:04.560
- Now, if you want.
- Give me your key, I'll go.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.160
This car will draw too much attention.

07:29.280 --> 07:34.120
If you stay below 300 km/h,
no cop will pull over a car like this.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.640
You're coming with me.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.680
That friend of yours thinks he's God.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.760
He is not a god,
but he does open doors.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.360
To him, we are that car,
going at 300 km/h.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.000
But at the first sign of trouble,
he switches cars.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.400
That car is not his.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.760
What am I to you?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.240
You're like how I was 10 years ago.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.320
I was angry, hungry,
as ambitious as a young dog.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.200
I felt I was the strongest of all.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.120
But not anymore?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.120
That was a different life.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.640
And yet you're joining us. Why?

09:08.240 --> 09:11.160
I couldn't take it anymore,
being in hell on my own.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.280
This is a kilo.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.040
You bought five of these packages.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.080
Tell your friend he'll receive a gift
if this continues.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.160
Guys, police.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.680
- Where?
- At gate 9.

10:11.800 --> 10:16.040
- How many cars?
- One, but they sniff around everywhere.

10:16.160 --> 10:21.240
- I'll go.
- Everything loaded up? Hurry then.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.440
Faster. Close it down.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.320
- Hurry up.
- Close it down.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.720
Get out of the car.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.840
Get out of the car.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.800
On your knees. Hurry up.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.560
Hurry up.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.560
Face down.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.520
Can we trust your friend
if they catch him?

12:17.640 --> 12:21.280
We'll have to see.
I think he's got balls.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.240
Quite a big amount.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.560
And it's still bricks.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.080
That's a lot of work.

12:36.360 --> 12:41.080
- We've grown out of this place.
- Then we'll find another.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.920
- Enzo, what's up?
- Hey, Don Saverio.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.680
- I have a proposal for you.
- Come in.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.200
When do you need it?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.040
Immediately.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.920
If everything goes well,
you'll get twice the amount next month.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.360
Really?

14:00.480 --> 14:01.880
Really.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.360
- How much junk does that guy have?
- Let's throw everything away.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.880
Except for Padre Pio.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.400
Hey, you're free.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.920
- And? What did they ask you?
- I said I wanted to test drive the car.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.520
- And then?
- Nothing, Antonello confirmed it.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.680
I got a reprimand from the commissioner,
and that's it.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.720
Yes, because you're from Posillipo.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.840
- We would've been in prison.
- That's why I lured them away.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.880
Goliat, prepare the coke for his friend.
Come with me.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.360
- You should've seen Ciro's face.
- Was he surprised?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.960
So you see, yuppies also have balls.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.440
- Ours are bigger.
- Your words.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.440
I'll show you out.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.920
Check if it works.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.760
Looks good, man.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.440
Two and five.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.920
- Where do all those people come from?
- They're friends of Valerio.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.080
- This stuff is flying off the shelf.
- It does.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.680
Hey, Mullet. And?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.520
Hey, guys. They're ready.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.599
- Now they'll fly.
- You're the man.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.400
- Bye, buddy.
- Bye, guys.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.640
- You were great.
- Assholes.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.480
Sir, there's a delivery for you.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.040
This package is for room 412.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.000
Goodbye.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.800
Here you go.

18:18.240 --> 18:22.080
- 50,000, and we've just started.
- And nobody notices.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.440
- Those assholes wanted to cross us.
- But we crossed them.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.560
Soon, there will be nothing left of them.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.080
Carmela, I'm here.
What did you want to tell me?

18:55.280 --> 18:57.160
I know everything, Enzo.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.120
You're going against people who've
been in this profession for 50 years.

19:04.240 --> 19:09.120
In those 50 years on the streets,
they only suffered colds.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.600
- You're in over your head.
- Don't worry.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.720
They know
you have nothing to do with it.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.880
- You kept your word.
- I don't want to cry about you.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.880
I know you very well.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Tell me, honestly, have you never
wanted to kill those thugs?

19:37.240 --> 19:39.120
I dreamed about it every night.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.080
Now it's no longer a dream.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.600
This is our moment.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.000
- Are you coming, Enzo?
- I'm coming.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.400
Did you see that car?

20:58.520 --> 21:01.320
- What about it?
- It was parked out front.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.680
I saw it on the monitor.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.000
We have to be careful, they found us.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.000
Are you coming along?

21:52.240 --> 21:53.960
Close the door.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.960
And?

22:04.080 --> 22:07.120
Blue Blood is the reason
our revenue has dropped.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.240
Come here.

22:32.680 --> 22:38.760
How is it possible that a couple of brats
with no pubic hair can screw us over?

22:38.880 --> 22:42.400
You are surrounded by idiots. Get out.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.200
They were able to do this
because they know us.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.720
But we didn't know them, that's why
we didn't pay attention to them.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.360
Fine.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.240
- We have to get rid of him.
- Okay.

22:58.360 --> 23:02.120
Wait, come here. Come here.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.400
I want to look that scumbag in the eye
before he dies.

23:10.520 --> 23:15.640
I know something. We'll bring him to you,
and then you can handle it yourself.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.320
Fine, you do that.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
What's this?

23:41.640 --> 23:45.040
The gift I promised.
Pay me if you sell it.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.640
I would only get it
if we continued our partnership.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.960
You saved Valerio from the police,
a brother.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.720
So hereby our partnership is continued.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.320
We can no longer condone this business.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.760
We have to get rid of him.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.800
That makes sense.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.640
I know only one thing:

24:41.800 --> 24:46.000
You only get rid of someone
if there's no other solution.

24:51.560 --> 24:54.080
I respect that idea...

24:54.200 --> 24:56.960
but he has the same blood
as his grandfather.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.760
Leave this to me, Ruggero.
I'll finish it.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.960
How can such a brave kid
suddenly have so much big talk?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.680
What do you mean?

25:11.800 --> 25:16.960
Blue Blood is backed by someone higher up.
That's the person we have to deal with.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.080
- Who can that be?
- I don't know.

25:20.440 --> 25:24.280
If I knew, he would be the first one
I would get rid of.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.800
We need to find out
who our real enemy is.

25:29.880 --> 25:35.040
- You must talk to Blue Blood.
- I should talk to him?

25:35.160 --> 25:38.640
- Do you really mean that?
- It's your zone, Eduardo.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.800
Donna Carmela.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.720
Can we talk for a second?

26:42.840 --> 26:45.200
Where in the world
should we talk about?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.280
Kids these days.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.880
These children are born smart,
but they know nothing about life.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.040
If you want to learn, you find someone
higher than you. No idiots.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.160
For that, you'll need
people with experience.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.440
And we have enough of those.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.960
Don Eduardo...

27:10.080 --> 27:12.040
Could you get to the point?

27:24.080 --> 27:26.400
Enzo has to stay below us.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.640
We have a good proposal for him.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.560
Talk him into it. He'll listen to you.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.200
What you're saying makes sense...

27:47.320 --> 27:49.680
to a family member.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.080
But I think we've never been family.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.200
So what, Donna Carmela?

27:56.360 --> 27:59.080
We can always become family.

27:59.200 --> 28:04.320
- Forget about the past, see the future.
- The past teaches you how to live.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.480
That's what my father once said.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.640
Of course.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.400
That's why I sit here at your table.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.280
Other people
wouldn't have come here to talk.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.680
I won't waste any more of your time.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.440
Good evening.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.440
Room 4.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.160
- One?
- Yes.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.120
Sweetheart.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.520
- You're so beautiful.
- I can't take it anymore.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.080
I missed you, you know?

30:06.600 --> 30:10.600
I'll come back.
I'm conquering it piece by piece.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.040
I don't want you to worry about me.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.080
And Pietro?

30:16.200 --> 30:18.120
He's doing fine.

30:18.240 --> 30:22.680
I often tell him about you,
I say that Dad will come home soon.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.960
You only have to think about him.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.520
- He is the most important.
- I know.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.080
Great.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.600
I'm working on that, Gennaro.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.240
Azzurra, is everything alright?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.040
Yes, Mom, I'm coming.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.960
Do you remember your father?

32:27.480 --> 32:28.880
Not really.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.280
He was always in a hurry.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.040
He once went to buy a present with me,
at Christmas.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.640
How was he?

32:46.920 --> 32:48.800
I don't remember.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.640
He left when he was 35
and then he was in jail for 20 years.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.240
He spent more time in jail than outside.

33:01.760 --> 33:08.120
According to Carmela, your dad would
certainly take the deal they'll offer you.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.440
Time will tell.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.640
But what do you think?

33:28.920 --> 33:31.360
I'm going to talk to Arenella.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.040
You don't know me that well.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.199
I'm always to the point.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.719
Fine, then let's not
waste each other's time.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.880
Stregone is your grandfather's brother,
your blood is in his heart.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.040
That's why he asked me
to also see your side of things.

34:35.159 --> 34:41.000
I won't kill you now, this is not the time.
But don't forget this.

34:44.239 --> 34:48.440
If that time comes,
we'll see who's still standing.

34:53.040 --> 34:59.160
Okay. I'll give you two zones. What your
father always wanted, but never received.

34:59.280 --> 35:04.080
Via Cicerone and Via Plinio, two streets
where you can make a lot of money.

35:06.160 --> 35:10.520
- What do you want in return?
- What you're taking away from us.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.680
We have our own channels.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.640
You'll have to silence them,
and tell me who they are.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.920
I've never betrayed my brothers.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.840
Poor kid...
You are no more than a rascal.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.560
You only have to tell me
who's behind you.

35:54.600 --> 35:58.000
Your days are numbered.
Watch your back.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.800
That applies to everyone, Don Eduardo.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.080
Come on, guys.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.800
- Who's there?
- It's me.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.120
Come in.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.320
Why are you here?

37:13.040 --> 37:18.040
You are no longer alone in hell.
I also bought a ticket.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.600
What do you mean?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.920
I told them no.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.480
No to what?

37:25.520 --> 37:30.080
Ciro, I'm under no illusions.
I know it's every man for himself...

37:30.200 --> 37:34.000
but sometimes it's better
to invest in people rather than things.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.160
Maybe, but that never happened to me.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.960
Nor to me, until now.

37:41.080 --> 37:46.160
Today, life surprised me.
They offered me the world and I said no.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.440
You know what the price was?

37:54.560 --> 37:56.400
You would've had to die.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.960
The war is about to begin.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.520
Enzo is ready.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.800
What happened?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.800
They offered him
everything his father died for.

39:05.920 --> 39:10.520
He said no.
He had to choose and he chose us.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.000
He chose you.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.080
That's why you're so happy.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.840
What is it?

39:34.200 --> 39:37.040
I've never hated someone
as much as you.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.960
But we're finally on the same side...

39:50.240 --> 39:52.240
and I don't want to end up alone.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.920
NEXT TIME

40:35.305 --> 40:41.594
