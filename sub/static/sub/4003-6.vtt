12:08.709 --> 12:10.083
YOU KNOW, WITH THE DRUGS
AND LILA.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.542
- WHO'S LILA?
- MY SPONSOR.

12:12.542 --> 12:13.750
- THE HOMICIDAL BITCH
HE SLEPT WITH.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.542
- OKAY.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.709
- NOW WE'RE MARRIED.

12:18.709 --> 12:22.333
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
A CHILD TOGETHER.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.792
AND YOU'RE
STILL KEEPING SECRETS.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.542
- RITA, I CAN SEE
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

12:26.542 --> 12:29.875
BUT, AS YOU DESCRIBE IT,

12:29.875 --> 12:32.250
THIS ISN'T NEW BEHAVIOR
FOR DEXTER.

12:33.583 --> 12:34.917
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:34.917 --> 12:37.959
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
KNEW ABOUT HIM

12:37.959 --> 12:39.417
WHEN YOU MARRIED HIM.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.208
- WHAT?
I HOPED HE WOULD CHANGE.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.875
- WHEN YOU MARRIED
YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

12:45.875 --> 12:47.875
DID YOU THINK
HE WOULD CHANGE TOO?

12:52.417 --> 12:55.875
- OKAY. OKAY, SO I HAVE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE TOO.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.166
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKES.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.834
- ME NEITHER.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.917
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.
WE ALWAYS WORK IT OUT.

13:10.917 --> 13:14.625
- I NEED A PARTNER,
DEXTER.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.000
SOMEONE I CAN TRUST.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.750
UNLESS YOU CAN BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME...

13:21.750 --> 13:23.834
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ANYMORE.

13:32.291 --> 13:35.792
- I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO SAVE MY FAMILY,

13:35.792 --> 13:37.917
AND I'M STILL FAILING.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.875
RITA'S PICTURING HER LIFE
WITHOUT ME,

13:39.875 --> 13:44.375
AND I CAN'T PICTURE MINE
WITHOUT HER...

13:44.375 --> 13:47.291
OR THE KIDS.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.500
HARRISON.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.625
- IS THAT THE HAMMER?

13:49.625 --> 13:52.583
- THE DEPTH IS TOO SHALLOW.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.875
MURDER WEAPON WAS HEAVIER.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.333
- WELL, NARROW IT DOWN, DEX.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.500
WE NEED A MODEL NUMBER.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.333
MAYBE WE CAN TRACK IT
TO A HARDWARE STORE

13:58.333 --> 13:59.583
OR AN INTERNET SITE.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.709
- I'LL TRY THIS 22-OUNCER.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.709
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:07.709 --> 14:08.875
- DNA.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.333
- WHOSE DNA?
THE VICTIM'S?

14:14.333 --> 14:15.959
THE KILLER'S?
- WAIT FOR IT.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.875
OKAY, THAT SMUDGE

14:18.875 --> 14:20.625
YOU FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.166
CREMATED HUMAN REMAINS.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.917
THAT FRAGMENT
WAS A LITTLE PIECE OF BONE.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.083
AND THANKS TO THE WONDERS
OF TECHNOLOGY

14:31.083 --> 14:32.709
AND TO MY
OWN SCIENTIFIC PROWESS...

14:32.709 --> 14:34.625
- YOU REHYDRATED IT AND?

14:34.625 --> 14:35.667
- DUDE, I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT FOR IT.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.417
AND I FOUND TWO STRAINS
OF DNA.

14:39.417 --> 14:41.041
ONE FROM THE FRAGMENT

14:41.041 --> 14:44.333
AND ONE FROM SALIVA.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.417
- WHOSE SALIVA?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.291
- THE KILLER'S.
COME ON, BUDDY.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.250
TRY TO KEEP UP.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.709
HOW DO YOU THINK HE GOT THE
ASHES TO STICK TO THE WALL?

14:52.709 --> 14:55.208
- WE GOT
THE KILLER'S GODDAMN DNA?

14:55.208 --> 14:56.875
- YOU F-IN' KNOW IT.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.875
I ROCK, RIGHT?
- YEAH, YOU DO TODAY.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.834
RUN IT THROUGH EVERY DATABASE
YOU CAN THINK OF.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.166
- OKAY.
- WE'RE GONNA FIND THIS GUY.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.667
- NO, YOU WON'T.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.125
ARTHUR MITCHELL ISN'T IN ANY

15:06.125 --> 15:07.875
OF OUR POLICE DATABASES.

15:07.875 --> 15:11.000
I ALREADY RAN HIM.
HE'S SQUEAKY CLEAN.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.834
HE HIDES THE REAL HIM,

15:12.834 --> 15:15.667
EXCEPT FROM THOSE ASHES.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.583
HE CAN ONLY BE HONEST
WITH THE DEAD.

15:20.542 --> 15:23.542
[phone rings]

15:25.542 --> 15:27.417
- MORGAN.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.166
I NEED THOSE VACATION MURDER
FILES BACK.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.291
GOT TO FINISH MY REPORT.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.000
- JUST GIVE ME
ANOTHER HOUR.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.083
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT
PUTS NIKKI AT LUNDY'S HOTEL.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.875
- MORGAN, WE GOT IT COVERED.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.959
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORKING
ANYWAY.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.250
YOU'RE ON SICK LEAVE.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.583
GO HOME.

15:40.583 --> 15:41.667
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

15:41.667 --> 15:45.375
OKAY?

15:47.834 --> 15:53.291
[voice mail beeps]

15:53.291 --> 15:54.959
- ONE UNHEARD MESSAGE.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.583
- HI, I'M CALLING
FOR DEBRA MORGAN.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.583
THIS IS VALERIE HODGES
RETURNING YOUR CALL

15:58.583 --> 16:00.500
FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.125
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG

16:02.125 --> 16:03.750
TO CALL YOU BACK,
BUT WHEN YOU SAID

16:03.750 --> 16:05.041
YOU WERE HARRY MORGAN'S
DAUGHTER,

16:05.041 --> 16:06.917
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.417
I FIGURED I'D JUST CALL,
BE DIRECT,

16:09.417 --> 16:10.792
SO IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH...

16:10.792 --> 16:14.458
- I TOLD YOU TO STOP WORKING.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.375
- THAT WASN'T WORK.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.667
THAT WAS WAY PERSONAL.
- COME ON.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.125
FOR YOU?
SAME DIFFERENCE.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.250
[water runs]

16:37.250 --> 16:38.834
- SHE WANTS A PARTNER.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.458
ONE WHO CAN OPEN UP.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.542
OKAY, I'LL SHARE.

16:43.542 --> 16:44.667
ABOUT WHAT?

16:44.667 --> 16:45.709
[clears throat]

16:45.709 --> 16:47.917
WORK.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.875
SPATTER ANALYSIS?

16:49.875 --> 16:51.917
NO.
SOMETHING PERSONAL.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.166
TRINITY?
TOO PERSONAL.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.500
FOOD?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.834
I'M HUNGRY.
I COULD TELL HER THAT.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.959
- WE'RE OUT OF BREAD AGAIN.

17:00.959 --> 17:04.959
- I'LL GO GET SOME.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.166
ARTHUR'S KEPT THIS UP
FOR, WHAT, 28 YEARS?

17:21.166 --> 17:23.166
MY FAMILY
MAY NOT LAST 20 MINUTES.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.792
WARMTH, INTIMACY.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.667
HE'S CONVINCING.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.125
BUT WHY THE SHOW?

17:30.125 --> 17:31.208
I'M THE ONLY ONE WATCHING.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.500
UNLESS IT'S MORE
THAN JUST CAMOUFLAGE.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.542
THAT'S HONEST AFFECTION

17:39.542 --> 17:41.959
SUSTAINED FOR YEARS.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.917
BUT HE'S LIKE ME.
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

17:48.875 --> 17:51.208
I WILL KILL HIM.
I NEED TO.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.709
BUT RIGHT NOW
I NEED TO SAVE MY FAMILY MORE.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.375
HIS CYCLE IS OVER.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.291
IT'LL BE A WHILE
BEFORE HE KILLS AGAIN,

17:59.291 --> 18:02.250
SO HE'S NOT
AN IMMEDIATE THREAT.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.041
AND I HAVE SO MUCH
TO LEARN.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.875
- ARTHUR MITCHELL.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.250
- KYLE BUTLER.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.291
- FOUR WALLS, ONE HEART.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.125
WE BUILD HOMES
FOR THE HOMELESS.

18:18.125 --> 18:21.083
WE MEET AT MY HOUSE,
THEN HEAD TO THE SITE TOGETHER.

18:21.083 --> 18:22.417
MY ADDRESS IS RIGHT
ON THE FLYER.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.792
- THANKS.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.917
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO GET MORE INVOLVED.

18:26.917 --> 18:29.458
- WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO SACRED FELLOWSHIP, KYLE?

18:29.458 --> 18:33.250
- UM...

18:33.250 --> 18:35.583
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.542
ANSWERS.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.750
MY WIFE AND I,
WE SEPARATED.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.500
SHE KICKED ME OUT

18:45.500 --> 18:49.917
AND TOOK THE KIDS.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.583
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.792
- YOU CAME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE, SON.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.917
- I JUST GOT AN EMAIL
FROM MY EDITOR.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.291
- YEAH?
ANYTHING GOOD?

19:12.291 --> 19:15.083
- WELL, HE WANTS MORE FROM ME
ON THE VACATION MURDERS.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.458
[laughs]

19:18.458 --> 19:21.041
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR ANY INSIDE SCOOP.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.750
- YEAH, 'CAUSE WE KNOW HOW WELL
THAT WORKED OUT LAST TIME.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.125
WHAT?

19:27.125 --> 19:31.166
- IF YOU COULD JUST HELP ME
GET AN INTERVIEW

19:31.166 --> 19:32.917
WITH DEBRA MORGAN...

19:32.917 --> 19:34.208
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.792
- IT'D BE A HERO PIECE

19:35.792 --> 19:37.166
ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.667
- NO.
NO WAY.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.000
- SHE'S YOUR PARTNER.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.375
- YEAH.
ADD TO THAT THE FACT

19:41.375 --> 19:43.291
THAT HER BROTHER HAS A BUG
UP HIS ASS ABOUT ME.

19:45.792 --> 19:48.875
LET'S ST SAY I'D RATHER
YOU LEFT IT ALONE.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.166
- OH.

19:50.166 --> 19:53.166
SINCE WHEN DID THAT
EVER STOP ME

19:53.166 --> 19:54.500
FROM GETTING
WHAT I WANT?

19:55.834 --> 19:57.667
[cell phone rings]

19:57.667 --> 20:00.625
- OH, HOLD ON.
IT MIGHT BE THE STATION.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.500
QUINN.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.166
- LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.

20:11.041 --> 20:14.333
- BE BACK IN A SEC,
OKAY?

20:17.458 --> 20:19.041
HEY.

20:19.041 --> 20:22.041
- I WANT TO BE
AN EYEWITNESS FOR THE SHOOTING.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.500
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.250
- I WAS IN SHOCK.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.291
MY MEMORY WAS FUZZY.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.125
- NOW IT'S CLEAR.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.000
- THERE'S NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND

20:36.000 --> 20:37.542
THAT NIKKI SHOT ME
AND FRANK.

20:37.542 --> 20:38.959
- MINE EITHER.

20:38.959 --> 20:40.417
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT GOING ON THE RECORD?

20:40.417 --> 20:42.208
AND WHAT HAPPENS LATER

20:42.208 --> 20:43.750
IF YOU DECIDE
YOU'RE STILL CONFUSED?

20:45.542 --> 20:46.542
- I WON'T.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.500
- YOU SURE?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.000
BECAUSE IF THIS COMES BACK
TO BITE YOU IN THE ASS,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.083
YOU'RE SCREWED.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.291
- MY DAD USED TO SAY
A GOOD COP

20:58.291 --> 21:01.875
DOES WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO CLOSE A CASE.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.000
- OTHER COPS.
NOT YOU.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.291
JUST THINK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

21:07.291 --> 21:08.375
I'D HATE TO HAVE YOU
MAKE A DECISION

21:08.375 --> 21:10.250
WHEN YOUR HEAD'S
NOT ON STRAIGHT.

21:22.709 --> 21:25.917
- THEY'RE ON
A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.834
NO WAY THEY'LL FIND A MATCH
TO TRINITY'S DNA.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.625
HE'S TOO WELL-HIDDEN.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.041
I COULD BE HELPING,

21:35.041 --> 21:37.291
FINDING THE HAMMER HE USED.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.792
OR I COULD HELP SOMEONE
IN NEED--

PRELIMINARY SPATTER REPORT

21:51.625 --> 21:52.959

21:52.959 --> 21:54.792
- WE LAND
ON THE SPECIFIC HAMMER

21:54.792 --> 21:55.959
FOR THE MURDER WEAPON?

21:55.959 --> 21:57.458
- NARROWING IT DOWN.
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.750
I'M ACTUALLY HEADING OUT NOW
TO DO SOME FIELD RESEARCH.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.250
- WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, VINCE?

22:01.250 --> 22:03.417
YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR ME
ON THAT DNA?

22:03.417 --> 22:04.709
- NO MATCHES
IN THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.

22:04.709 --> 22:07.500
- DUH.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.542
- WAIT.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.333
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
THE BIG REVEAL.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.041
BECAUSE I'M ME, AND I HAPPEN
TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX,

22:16.041 --> 22:17.500
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
AN AWESOME FORENSIC TECH--

22:17.500 --> 22:18.667
- MASUKA.

22:18.667 --> 22:22.083
- I RAN THE HUMAN REMAINS
AGAINST THE SALIVA.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.750
AND GUESS WHAT I FOUND?

22:23.750 --> 22:26.333
MATCHING MITOCHONDRIAL DNA.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.458
- ENGLISH, POR FAVOR.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.917
- THE KILLER IS RELATED
TO THE HUMAN REMAINS.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.458
SAME FAMILY.

22:32.458 --> 22:37.166
- HE KEEPS HIS FAMILY WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.458
- WELL, ARE THEY
GONNA GO VISIT HIM IN PRISON?

22:39.458 --> 22:40.875
'CAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO GET HIM CAUGHT.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.125
- MAYBE HE WANTS
TO GET CAUGHT.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.083
- OR HE'S SENDING A MESSAGE.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.500
- OR HE'S TRYING TO LEAVE

22:44.500 --> 22:46.834
SOME KIND OF A LEGACY.

22:46.834 --> 22:50.333
- HEY. HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT WORKING THIS CASE?

22:51.542 --> 22:54.750
- I'M BUSY.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.625
GOT A REPORT
TO FINISH.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.709
- HIS FAMILY KEEPS HIM SAFE,

22:59.709 --> 23:02.208
BUT THESE ASHES
LEAVE HIM EXPOSED.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.166
MAYBE THIS IS
HOW I GET TO THE TRUTH.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.542
THE MURDER WEAPON.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.250
HE'S USING IT OUT IN THE OPEN

23:11.250 --> 23:12.959
FOR ALL THE WORLD
TO SEE.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.375
NOT SOMETHING I WOULD DO.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.166
BUT ARTHUR HAS TOOLS
THAT I DON'T.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.959
- HEY. GLAD TO SEE
YOU MADE IT.

23:26.959 --> 23:28.041
KYLE BUTLER.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.834
- YOU REMEMBER MY NAME.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.375
- OH, I'M LIKE AN ELEPHANT.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.709
I NEVER FORGET.

23:33.709 --> 23:34.750
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY TOOLS
TO BRING?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.208
- LOST 'EM IN THE MOVE.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.125
- WELL, HERE.
TAKE MY HAMMER.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.291
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER,
THOUGH.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.291
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.959
- SO I SAW.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.125
VERY KIND OF YOU,
ARTHUR.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.917
- WELL, GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT,
KYLE.

23:50.917 --> 23:52.250
IT'S THE REASON
WE'RE ALL HERE.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.667
- NOT ALL OF US.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.041
- COME ON.
I'LL GET YOU SET UP.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.750
- OKAY.

23:57.750 --> 24:01.667
GRANT 24-OUNCE STEEL FRAMING
HAMMER, MODEL NUMBER 514.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.250
LAGUERTA WILL BE PLEASED.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.166
- JUST BANG IN THESE THREE.

24:05.166 --> 24:06.375
THEY'RE ALREADY MARKED.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.542
- UH-HUH.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.875
BUT I HAVE
MORE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.542
- SO, ARTHUR, YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY BEEN DOING THIS

24:15.542 --> 24:16.750
A LONG TIME?
- OH, YEAH, FOR YEARS.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.875
I TOOK SALLY ON A BUILD
FOR OUR VERY FIRST DATE.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.959
AND THE KIDS HAVE BEEN COMING

24:23.959 --> 24:24.917
EVER SINCE THEY COULD HOLD
A HAMMER.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.417
- YOU ALL SEEM
REALLY CLOSE. HAPPY.

24:31.417 --> 24:32.709
- YEAH.

24:32.709 --> 24:33.792
WE ARE.

24:33.792 --> 24:36.625
- ENVIOUS.

24:58.291 --> 24:59.583
YOU'RE ARTHUR'S SON,
RIGHT?

24:59.583 --> 25:01.125
I'M KYLE.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.333
- OH, JONAH.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.792
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- SEEMS POLITE.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.834
WELL ADJUSTED.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

25:06.834 --> 25:07.834
- IT'S HOT.

25:07.834 --> 25:09.417
[laughs]

25:09.417 --> 25:10.500
- IT'S NICE THAT YOU'RE HERE,
THOUGH.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
THERE'S GOT TO BE OTHER WAYS

25:11.500 --> 25:12.709
YOU'D RATHER SPEND
YOUR AFTERNOON.

25:12.709 --> 25:14.417
- WELL, NO, IT'S OKAY.

25:14.417 --> 25:16.500
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
ARE BIG ON THE FAMILY TIME.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.625
- THAT'S NICE.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.667
FOR TOO MANY KIDS,
FAMILY TIME MEANS FIGHTING TIME.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.458
- NOT MINE.
- NEVER?

25:24.458 --> 25:27.000
- NOT MUCH TO FIGHT ABOUT,
REALLY.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.083
MY PARENTS ARE COOL.

25:28.083 --> 25:31.166
- YEAH, YOUR DAD SEEMS
LIKE A SPECIAL GUY.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.166
- HE IS.

25:32.166 --> 25:34.500
I-I REALLY LUCKED OUT.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.375
- HOW SO?

25:36.375 --> 25:39.458
- A LOT OF WAYS.
LIKE, YOU SEE THAT?

25:39.458 --> 25:41.041
IT'S BEEN MY DAD'S BABY
FOR YEARS.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.166
A FEW DAYS AGO,
HE HANDS ME THE KEYS.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.375
- GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT.

25:45.375 --> 25:47.959
- FOUNDATION OF LOVE, MAN.

25:47.959 --> 25:49.291
BEST DAD EVER.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.542
- FATHER OF THE FREAKIN' YEAR.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.834
- OH, I GOT TO GET BACK
TO WORK.

25:55.834 --> 26:00.667
DAD'S NOT A BIG FAN
OF IDLE HANDS.

26:09.917 --> 26:10.875
- HEY, NIKKI.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.208
YOU REMEMBER ME?

26:15.208 --> 26:17.583
- YEAH.
THAT COP.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.667
- DETECTIVE.

26:20.667 --> 26:21.667
THE ONE YOU SHOT.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.000
- JESUS CHRIST.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.750
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.583
I TOLD YOUR BOSS EVERYTHING
ALREADY.

26:29.583 --> 26:34.250
- NOW YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.834
ONLY THIS TIME
YOU'RE GONNA TELL THE TRUTH.

26:35.834 --> 26:36.917
- I TOLD YOU.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.917
I'VE BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH
THE WHOLE TIME.

26:38.917 --> 26:41.417
- WELL, THEN COME HERE
AND TELL IT TO MY FACE.

26:41.417 --> 26:44.709
- THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.208
- A BIT CLOSER
SO I CAN SEE YOUR EYES.

27:00.208 --> 27:03.041
- THE NIGHT
THAT YOU GOT SHOT,

27:03.041 --> 27:04.917
I WAS IN A HOTEL ROOM
WITH JOHNNY.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.250
- BULLSHIT.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.291
- WE DID METH,

27:09.291 --> 27:10.542
WE WATCHED PORN,
WE FUCKED.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.792
I MEAN, WE WERE WATCHING
CARTOONS ALL NIGHT.

27:12.792 --> 27:13.917
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

27:13.917 --> 27:14.917
- YOU FUCKING LIAR.

27:14.917 --> 27:17.333
- NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
YOU ASK ME,

27:17.333 --> 27:18.959
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.291
I DIDN'T SHOOT YOU,
OKAY?

27:21.291 --> 27:23.458
I DIDN'T KILL THAT OLD MAN.

27:23.458 --> 27:28.625
OW! FUCK!
JESUS CHRIST!

27:30.959 --> 27:32.750
- I'M GONNA SAY I SAW YOU.

27:32.750 --> 27:36.125
- PEOPLE GET MUGGED EVERY DAY.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.834
MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE
WANTED YOU DEAD.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.041
HUH?
- LIKE WHO? LIKE WHO?

27:40.041 --> 27:43.625
- OH, FUCK. YOU'RE A FUCKING COP
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.500
YOU PISS PEOPLE OFF
FOR A LIVING.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.750
- FUCK YOU.

27:46.750 --> 27:50.625
- FUCK YOU.
FUCKING HURTING ME.

27:50.625 --> 27:51.667
[whimpers]

27:51.667 --> 27:54.125
- YOU THINK THAT HURTS?

27:54.125 --> 27:55.875
TRY WATCHING THE MAN YOU LOVE

27:55.875 --> 27:58.709
DIE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
WITH NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

28:02.208 --> 28:05.250
OH, RIGHT.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.709
YOU SHOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

28:09.333 --> 28:12.000
YOU NASTY PIECE OF SHIT.

28:13.792 --> 28:17.667
- I KILLED JOHNNY.
I KNOW. I KILLED...

28:17.667 --> 28:19.834
[weeps]

28:19.834 --> 28:24.667
I DO MISS JOHNNY.
I KNOW.

28:24.667 --> 28:27.667
IF YOU--
IF YOU SAY

28:27.667 --> 28:30.250
THAT YOU SAW ME
KILL FRANK LUNDY,

28:30.250 --> 28:31.375
THEN YOU'RE THE LIAR.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.166
YOU ARE THE LIAR!

28:33.166 --> 28:35.000
[sobs]

28:41.375 --> 28:42.709
- I'D LIKE TO BE TRANSFERRED

28:42.709 --> 28:43.959
OUT OF HOMICIDE.

28:43.959 --> 28:45.792
- ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE NEXT BEST THING,

28:45.792 --> 28:47.542
HEY, LIEUTENANT?
- AREN'T WE ALL?

28:47.542 --> 28:49.291
- YEAH.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.834
- I COULD USE A CHANGE
OF SCENERY.

28:50.834 --> 28:54.375
I'M THINKING PRESS LIAISON.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.834
- WELL, P.R. COULD CERTAINLY USE
YOUR POLITICAL SKILLS.

28:57.834 --> 29:00.125
- AND SERGEANT BATISTA
COULD STAY IN HOMICIDE.

29:00.125 --> 29:04.166
- WELL, LET ME THINK
ABOUT IT.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.125
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE NOT EASILY REPLACED.

29:06.125 --> 29:10.250
- THAT DIDN'T SEEM
TO BE A PROBLEM BEFORE.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.750
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT I DECIDE.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.542
- HELLO.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.667
- TELL ME THAT'S
THE LAST OF IT.

29:21.667 --> 29:22.875
THE LAST BAG
FROM YOUR APARTMENT.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.458
- IT'S NOT FROM MY APARTMENT.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.709
BUT, RITA, WAIT, WAIT.

29:25.709 --> 29:27.917
SURPRISE FOR YOU,
FOR ALL OF YOU.

29:27.917 --> 29:31.041
- NO WAY.
A NINTENDO DS?

29:31.041 --> 29:33.917
- I KNOW IT'S NOT AN iPOD...
- A MINI DVD PLAYER?

29:33.917 --> 29:36.125
THIS IS AWESOME.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.959
- FOR HARRISON.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.917
AND FOR MY LOVELY WIFE.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.542
- A BREAD MAKER?

29:52.542 --> 29:54.208
- WE'RE ALWAYS RUNNING
OUT OF BREAD.

29:54.208 --> 29:56.458
- WE'RE ALWAYS RUNNING
OUT OF MILK.

29:56.458 --> 29:57.792
DID YOU GET ME A COW TOO?

29:57.792 --> 29:59.834
- THANK YOU SO MUCH!

29:59.834 --> 30:01.625
- THIS IS SO AWESOME.
THANK YOU, DEXTER.

30:01.625 --> 30:05.500
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR GIFT?

30:14.667 --> 30:17.166
- I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.041
I REALLY DO.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.834
BUT WE DON'T NEED GIFTS.

30:21.834 --> 30:24.083
WE NEED YOU.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.792
- NEED ME TO DO WHAT?

30:33.458 --> 30:34.834
- JUST TALK TO ME.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.333
- [babbles]

30:38.333 --> 30:41.709
- I'M, UH...

30:41.709 --> 30:44.000
PEOPLE JUST DO THIS?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
SAY WHAT THEY'RE THINKING?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.166
OUT LOUD?

30:48.166 --> 30:52.250
[sighs]

30:52.250 --> 30:53.542
- HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

30:53.542 --> 30:55.458
- I'M TRYING.
I'M TRYING.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.542
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:59.542 --> 31:02.125
YOU CAN TRY HARDER
IN THERAPY.

31:02.125 --> 31:03.667
I'M MOVING UP
OUR NEXT SESSION.

31:09.834 --> 31:12.959
- [chuckles]

31:12.959 --> 31:14.625
- WOW.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.125
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

31:16.125 --> 31:17.458
- I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.000
YOU WANT TO GUESS?

31:19.000 --> 31:22.333
- UM, YOU'RE NAKED
UNDER THERE,

31:22.333 --> 31:23.375
AND I GET TO SEE?

31:23.375 --> 31:24.458
- [chuckles]

31:24.458 --> 31:27.250
GUESS WHAT ELSE
YOU GET TO DO?

31:27.250 --> 31:30.417
- OKAY, NOW I'M REALLY HAVING
IMPURE THOUGHTS.

31:30.417 --> 31:33.917
- YOU GET TO STAY
IN HOMICIDE.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.000
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.166
- WOW.
HOW DID YOU--

31:39.166 --> 31:41.000
- I HAD A LITTLE TALK
WITH THE DEPUTY CHIEF,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
AND I TOLD HIM HOMICIDE
COULDN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.667
AND NEITHER COULD I.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.458
- YOU...

31:49.458 --> 31:51.375
ARE...

31:51.375 --> 31:52.375
AMAZING.

31:52.375 --> 31:55.792
- MM-HMM.

31:55.792 --> 31:57.542
- SO HE'S OKAY
WITH BOTH OF US STAYING?

31:59.375 --> 32:02.750
- WELL, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT LOGISTICS LATER.

32:02.750 --> 32:03.792
RIGHT?

32:08.500 --> 32:09.750
- YOU TOLD HIM
YOU'D LEAVE INSTEAD.

32:09.750 --> 32:13.000
- ANGEL.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.041
IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.917
- YOU'RE FULL OF IT.

32:16.917 --> 32:19.625
YOU'RE SWEET,
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,

32:19.625 --> 32:20.667
BUT YOU'RE FULL OF IT,

32:20.667 --> 32:24.041
AND I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

32:24.041 --> 32:28.625
- WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU LEAVE HOMICIDE.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.083
YOU LOVE IT.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.333
AND IF YOU LEAVE,
YOU WON'T BE YOU.

32:32.333 --> 32:33.959
AT LEAST NOT THE YOU
THAT I WANT TO BE WITH.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.083
- WHAT DO WE DO?

32:41.709 --> 32:44.375
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:44.375 --> 32:47.291
[sighs]

32:50.417 --> 32:54.792
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT?

32:54.792 --> 32:56.125
OUR JOBS OR EACH OTHER?

33:04.250 --> 33:07.834
- SHIT.

33:07.834 --> 33:10.125
- SHIT IS RIGHT.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.458
- THIS IS ARTHUR MITCHELL

33:17.458 --> 33:18.959
AT HIS CORE.

33:18.959 --> 33:20.959
IS THERE SOMETHING
IN HIS DNA

33:20.959 --> 33:22.458
THAT LETS HIM KEEP A FAMILY?

33:22.458 --> 33:26.959
SOME MAGIC GENE I'M MISSING?

33:26.959 --> 33:29.375
- LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.291
YOU'RE SURFING ON MY TURF,
BLOOD GUY.

33:31.291 --> 33:32.333
- JUST CURIOUS.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.166
- THEN YOU'LL BE INTERESTED
TO KNOW

33:34.166 --> 33:36.875
THAT THE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA...

33:36.875 --> 33:38.875
FEMALE.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.792
- SO MOTHER, DAUGHTER,

33:40.792 --> 33:42.291
SISTER...

33:42.291 --> 33:44.000
- COULD EVEN BE HIS GRANNY
HE SMUDGED ON THAT WALL.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.333
PROBABLY WHACKS OFF
WITH HER ASHES.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.917
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

33:49.917 --> 33:51.417
- WHY WOULDN'T HE?

33:51.417 --> 33:53.583
- BECAUSE SHE'S IMPORTANT
TO HIM.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.250
- DUDE. JOKE.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.667
- HIS HISTORY WITH HER
SHAPES WHO HE IS.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.333
- LIKE HOW MY MOTHER
BREAST-FED ME TILL I WAS SIX

34:01.333 --> 34:03.041
AND NOW NO ONE
WILL EVER MATCH UP.

34:07.083 --> 34:09.083
- LIEUTENANT.

34:09.083 --> 34:13.375
IT'S A GRANT 24-OUNCE
STEEL FRAMING HAMMER.

34:13.375 --> 34:15.125
- SORRY?

34:15.125 --> 34:16.959
- IT'S THE MURDER WEAPON
IN THE BLUDGEONING CASE.

34:16.959 --> 34:19.041
I DID
SOME INDEPENDENT RESEARCH.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.750
UPDATED MY REPORT.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.542
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
THANKS.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.542
- ACTUALLY, I'M DONE
WITH MY WORK FOR THE DAY.

34:25.542 --> 34:26.542
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,

34:26.542 --> 34:27.959
I HAVE SOME PERSONAL STUFF
TO TAKE CARE OF.

34:27.959 --> 34:30.375
- OH.

34:30.375 --> 34:31.875
TAKE CARE OF THE PERSONAL STUFF,
DEXTER.

34:31.875 --> 34:36.166
TAKE VERY GOOD CARE.

34:39.041 --> 34:40.583
- SURE AS HELL TRYING TO.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.083
- YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS
NEVER GO BAD.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.917
- WELL, YEAH,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

34:54.917 --> 34:58.417
I'VE HAD THESE
SINCE I WAS A ROOKIE.

34:58.417 --> 35:02.208
- SO I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM YOU
ABOUT BEING AN EYEWITNESS.

35:02.208 --> 35:04.709
THAT MEAN
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

35:04.709 --> 35:07.208
- YEAH.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.750
JUST 'CAUSE NIKKI'S
A PIECE OF SHIT

35:08.750 --> 35:10.125
AND MY DAD WAS A LYING SACK

35:10.125 --> 35:11.375
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO BE.

35:14.458 --> 35:15.917
THANKS FOR TALKING SOME SENSE
INTO ME.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.834
- JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR MY PARTNER.

35:18.834 --> 35:19.917
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

35:22.291 --> 35:24.500
- I'M THINKING MAYBE NIKKI WALD
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.542
- SINCE WHEN?

35:26.542 --> 35:29.125
- SINCE I TALKED
TO HER MYSELF.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.583
- WAIT, YOU WHAT?

35:31.583 --> 35:32.917
- I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
EVERYTHING YOU COLLECTED

35:32.917 --> 35:35.875
FROM LUNDY'S HOTEL AND...

35:35.875 --> 35:39.083
ALL HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.458
HERE'S THE THING.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.583
SOME OF IT'S MISSING.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.208
- NO WAY.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.041
IT WAS ALL LOGGED IN.
BY ME.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.000
- LUNDY HAD RESEARCH BOOKS

35:46.000 --> 35:47.792
ON THAT SERIAL KILLER
HE WAS HUNTING.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.542
AND AUDIO TAPES.

35:49.542 --> 35:51.125
I SAW THEM IN HIS ROOM.

35:51.125 --> 35:53.792
- YOU STILL WRAPPED UP
IN THAT, DEB?

35:53.792 --> 35:56.000
I DON'T MEAN
TO SPEAK ILL,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.083
BUT THE GUY WAS CHASING
A GHOST.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.583
- I THINK THAT GHOST
STOLE HIS BOOKS.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.458
- YOU GOT TO STOP.

36:05.458 --> 36:06.792
YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF CRAZY.

36:06.792 --> 36:09.667
- I'M TELLING YOU,
SOMEONE TOOK LUNDY'S STUFF.

36:09.667 --> 36:13.959
- AND I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU GOT TO LET THIS GO.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.125
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU'RE TIRED.

36:15.125 --> 36:18.500
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME--
- AND WHAT?

36:18.500 --> 36:20.291
PAINT MY FUCKING NAILS?

36:23.458 --> 36:25.667
I'M KIND OF SICK
OF HEARING IT, QUINN.

36:25.667 --> 36:29.458
- THEN I GUESS
I WON'T SAY IT ANYMORE.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.000
- I AM NO LONGER SEEING
LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.667
I MEAN, I SEE HER EVERY DAY,
BUT...

36:43.667 --> 36:45.542
- WE BROKE UP.

36:45.542 --> 36:47.333
OFFICIALLY.

36:47.333 --> 36:49.709
- AND PERMANENTLY.

36:49.709 --> 36:52.375
- ARE YOU SURE?

36:52.375 --> 36:53.875
BECAUSE, FRANKLY, I'M GETTING
A LITTLE SICK

36:53.875 --> 36:54.875
OF THE BACK AND FORTH.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.417
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

36:57.417 --> 36:59.375
- WELL, IT'S MIDDLE SCHOOL
BULLSHIT, LIEUTENANT.

36:59.375 --> 37:02.041
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.542
- YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

37:03.542 --> 37:05.208
WE'VE BOTH SIGNED AFFIDAVITS
TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.125
OUR RELATIONSHIP
DIDN'T INTERFERE

37:07.125 --> 37:09.417
WITH ANY
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS,

37:09.417 --> 37:11.583
AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT BE
HELD LIABLE FOR ANY FALLOUT.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.667
- WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
AT LEAST.

37:13.667 --> 37:16.458
- FOR THE RECORD, NEITHER ONE
OF US WAS SEXUALLY HARASSED.

37:16.458 --> 37:19.542
- YEAH, ALL ADVANCES
WERE VERY WELCOMED.

37:19.542 --> 37:20.959
- AND THERE WAS NOT
NOR WILL THERE BE

37:20.959 --> 37:23.125
A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.959
- SO IT'S DONE.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.500
WE'RE BOTH STAYING
IN HOMICIDE.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.542
- LET ME BE CLEAR.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.875
THE PAPERWORK YOU'RE FILING
IS SERIOUS.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.000
IF I FIND OUT
THIS IS BULLSHIT,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.417
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

37:41.417 --> 37:44.917
SEVERE, CAREER-ENDING
CONSEQUENCES.

37:48.250 --> 37:49.500
[elevator bell dings]

37:49.500 --> 37:52.250
- DON'T, ANGEL.

37:52.250 --> 37:53.667
IT'S OVER.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.291
- RIGHT.
SORRY.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.417
- I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.041
- THIS IS THE LAST OF IT.

38:19.041 --> 38:22.333
MY DARK PASSENGER'S...STUFF

38:22.333 --> 38:25.333
AND THE REASON I CAN'T LET GO
OF MY APARTMENT.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.125
IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HIDE THIS,

38:27.125 --> 38:29.959
I'M GONNA LOSE MY FAMILY.

38:29.959 --> 38:33.125
TRINITY HAS THE ANSWER.

38:33.125 --> 38:36.750
HE'S KEPT HIS FAMILY CLOSE.
EVEN AFTER DEATH.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.417
WHO DID YOU LOSE, ARTHUR?

39:10.458 --> 39:13.000
1959. 16.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.125
VERA MITCHELL.

39:15.125 --> 39:18.000
SISTER OF ARTHUR MITCHELL.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.166
FOUND DEAD IN A...

39:19.166 --> 39:21.291
BATHTUB.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.792
MARSHA MITCHELL.

39:26.792 --> 39:31.166
1961. 40.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.875
JUMPED TO HER DEATH
OFF THE COLLINS CANAL BRIDGE.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.834
HENRY MITCHELL.

39:39.834 --> 39:42.375
1964. 45.

39:42.375 --> 39:45.333
DIED IN AN ALLEY
OF A FATAL HEAD WOUND.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.166
SISTER, MOTHER, FATHER.

39:57.166 --> 39:59.083
HE'S RECREATING THEIR DEATHS.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.458
DECADE AFTER DECADE.

40:00.458 --> 40:03.500
CYCLES OF THREE.

40:07.542 --> 40:10.583
I WATCHED MY MOTHER GET SAWED
INTO PIECES.

40:10.583 --> 40:13.667
NOW I CUT PEOPLE UP.

40:15.709 --> 40:17.208
WE BOTH HAVE SKELETONS,

40:17.208 --> 40:20.208
WHICH MEANS WE BOTH GET A CLOSET
TO KEEP THEM IN.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.959
ARTHUR HAS A CLOSET.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.125
I KNOW ALMOST EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU, ARTHUR,

40:31.125 --> 40:32.834
EXCEPT WHERE YOU HIDE.

40:32.834 --> 40:36.000
READY OR NOT,
HERE I COME.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.750
[machine buzzes]

41:20.709 --> 41:23.458
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
KYLE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

41:23.458 --> 41:25.291
- YEAH, CUT MYSELF
AT THE BUILD.

41:25.291 --> 41:26.125
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A BIG DEAL,

41:26.125 --> 41:27.291
BUT IT WON'T STOP BLEEDING.

41:27.291 --> 41:30.500
- HERE.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.542
- RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.

41:34.542 --> 41:36.625
THERE MUST BE MORE
HE'S HIDING INSIDE.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.083
- COME ON IN.

41:38.083 --> 41:41.625
WE GOT A FIRST AID KIT
IN THE HOUSE.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.125
[grunts]
SORRY.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.000
NO BOOTS IN THE HOUSE.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.750
[chuckles]

41:48.750 --> 41:49.709
HERE, I'LL GET THE KIT.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.041
YOU MAKE YOURSELF
AT HOME.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.542
- THANKS.
I WILL.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.500
TACKY, BUT NORMAL.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.333
HIS SECRETS MUST BE
UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

42:17.041 --> 42:21.792
NOT THE DIRTY LAUNDRY
I'M LOOKING FOR.

42:27.291 --> 42:30.417
[rattles]
SHIT.

42:30.417 --> 42:35.166
ARTHUR HAS A PLACE
TO PUT HIS LAMP.

42:41.875 --> 42:44.834
THE DATES AND LOCATIONS
FROM LUNDY'S BOOKS.

42:44.834 --> 42:47.083
ARTHUR'S BEEN USING
FOUR WALLS BUILDS

42:47.083 --> 42:49.166
AROUND THE COUNTRY
AS A COVER TO KILL.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.667
AND THESE ARE HIS TROPHIES.

42:54.542 --> 42:56.166
HANGING RIGHT UP HERE
ON THE WALL

42:56.166 --> 42:59.041
JUST LIKE HIS HAMMER
IN THE GARAGE.

42:59.041 --> 43:01.583
HIS BLOOD SLIDES.

43:01.583 --> 43:03.875
HE DOESN'T NEED
A SECRET APARTMENT.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.542
HE'S HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT,

43:05.542 --> 43:08.166
RIGHT IN THE CENTER
OF HIS FAMILY.

43:08.166 --> 43:13.250
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

43:13.250 --> 43:17.500
AND HERE SHE IS,
ARTHUR'S OWN DARK PASSENGER--

43:17.500 --> 43:22.041
HIS SISTER VERA.

43:23.625 --> 43:25.291
THE TANK IS LOW,

43:25.291 --> 43:27.875
BUT THEN, SHE'S BEEN ON THE ROAD
FOR 30 YEARS.

43:27.875 --> 43:29.000
- KYLE!

43:29.000 --> 43:30.417
- HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT
IS ONE THING,

43:30.417 --> 43:32.291
BUT THIS IS YOUR WEAK SPOT.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.583
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN IT'S EXPOSED?

43:34.583 --> 43:38.375
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

43:41.291 --> 43:43.250
- OKAY.

43:43.250 --> 43:46.542
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT HAND...

44:03.834 --> 44:08.000
DON'T TOUCH...

44:08.000 --> 44:09.542
MY SISTER.

44:09.542 --> 44:11.208
- I'M SORRY.

44:11.208 --> 44:14.083
I DIDN'T KNOW.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.000
I CAN'T BREATHE.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.583
- I'M SORRY.

44:23.583 --> 44:26.709
- [coughs]

44:26.709 --> 44:28.291
- FORGIVE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.208
- JESUS, ARTHUR,
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

44:30.208 --> 44:34.083
- IT'S JUST...

44:34.083 --> 44:35.500
MY SISTER...

44:38.500 --> 44:40.125
SHE DIED
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

44:42.583 --> 44:43.959
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL
FOR ME.

44:47.125 --> 44:50.083
- I UNDERSTAND.

44:50.083 --> 44:52.333
I'VE LOST PEOPLE TOO.

44:54.875 --> 44:56.166
- YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT.

45:08.709 --> 45:10.291
- IF THE ASHES
BOTHER YOU SO MUCH,

45:10.291 --> 45:14.333
WHY DO YOU KEEP THEM OUT?

45:14.333 --> 45:17.750
- BECAUSE SHE'S
A PART OF ME, KYLE.

45:17.750 --> 45:18.834
HELPED MAKE ME WHO I AM.

45:23.875 --> 45:28.208
- BUT IF YOUR FAMILY
EVER SAW YOU SO UPSET...

45:28.208 --> 45:31.083
- THEY'D UNDERSTAND.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.917
THIS IS MY HOME.

45:32.917 --> 45:34.000
I CAN BE MYSELF HERE.

45:37.375 --> 45:39.333
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND EASY.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.667
- [laughs]

45:40.667 --> 45:44.375
I USED TO PUSH PEOPLE AWAY

45:44.375 --> 45:46.542
BECAUSE OF MY PAST.

45:46.542 --> 45:50.208
EVEN LOST A RELATIONSHIP
OVER IT.

45:50.208 --> 45:51.542
LIKE YOU.

45:51.542 --> 45:53.417
[unpeeling bandage]

45:53.417 --> 45:54.417
- BUT YOU CHANGED.

45:54.417 --> 45:57.083
- YEAH, I MET SALLY,

45:57.083 --> 45:59.083
HAD MY KIDS,

45:59.083 --> 46:01.875
AND I REALIZED

46:01.875 --> 46:03.000
THE ONLY WAY
IT WAS GONNA WORK

46:03.000 --> 46:05.709
IS IF I JUMPED IN
WITH BOTH FEET.

46:08.583 --> 46:11.625
- JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET.

46:11.625 --> 46:15.291
- UH-HUH.

46:15.291 --> 46:17.375
- AND THAT
SAVED YOUR FAMILY?

46:20.125 --> 46:22.917
- KYLE,

46:22.917 --> 46:25.750
MY FAMILY SAVED ME.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.583
WAIT.

46:36.583 --> 46:37.917
I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

46:48.083 --> 46:49.959
FOR THE NEXT BUILD.

46:49.959 --> 46:53.917
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR OWN TOOLS.

46:55.875 --> 46:57.792
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

46:57.792 --> 46:58.792
- THANKS.

46:58.792 --> 47:01.875
FOR GIVING ME
YOUR MURDER WEAPON.

47:01.875 --> 47:04.125
- SEE YOU
AT THE NEXT BUILD THEN.

47:04.125 --> 47:05.792
- WOULDN'T MISS IT.

47:05.792 --> 47:08.834
I WANT TO BE A PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

47:11.834 --> 47:13.625
AND I KNOW I NEED
TO JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET.

47:13.625 --> 47:15.500
- I'M GLAD, BUT...

47:15.500 --> 47:18.709
- I WANT TO LET YOU IN.

47:21.750 --> 47:26.583
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW...

47:26.583 --> 47:28.625
HOW.

47:32.917 --> 47:37.125
I NEVER LEARNED.

47:37.125 --> 47:38.792
- NO, OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

47:40.834 --> 47:42.375
GOD, I...

47:42.375 --> 47:43.583
I MEAN,
WITH YOUR MOTHER AND--

47:43.583 --> 47:45.542
- WHAT ABOUT HIS MOTHER?

47:45.542 --> 47:47.709
- SHE WAS MURDERED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

47:47.709 --> 47:49.500
- WOW, THAT'S...

47:49.500 --> 47:51.959
THAT'S QUITE A HISTORY.

47:56.166 --> 47:59.625
- AND IT SHAPED WHO I AM.

47:59.625 --> 48:03.875
BUT I WANT TO CHANGE.

48:03.875 --> 48:05.875
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
DEXTER.

48:05.875 --> 48:08.750
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO BE HONEST.

48:08.750 --> 48:09.834
- I'LL TRY.

48:09.834 --> 48:12.166
- WOULD YOU SAY
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID

48:12.166 --> 48:13.667
TO LET RITA GET CLOSE
TO YOU?

48:16.166 --> 48:18.166
- YES.
- WHY?

48:21.542 --> 48:23.291
- BECAUSE OF MY PAST.

48:23.291 --> 48:25.041
- ARE YOU AFRAID
SHE'LL ABANDON YOU?

48:25.041 --> 48:27.792
- YES.

48:27.792 --> 48:29.333
- BUT RITA IS NOT YOUR MOTHER.

48:31.709 --> 48:34.875
- NO, DEFINITELY NOT,
BUT IF SHE...

48:34.875 --> 48:40.291
EVER SEES ME
FOR WHO I REALLY AM...

48:40.291 --> 48:42.166
- THEN WHAT?

48:42.166 --> 48:44.208
YOU THINK I WOULD LEAVE?

48:44.208 --> 48:46.625
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

48:46.625 --> 48:48.000
- OH.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.333
WELL, THEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO LEARN ABOUT ME.

48:50.333 --> 48:53.792
I MARRIED YOU
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET

48:53.792 --> 48:56.250
TO KNOW THE REAL YOU.

48:56.250 --> 48:59.625
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

48:59.625 --> 49:00.625
- DEXTER.

49:00.625 --> 49:03.917
TELL RITA THE TRUTH.

49:03.917 --> 49:05.625
WHY DID YOU KEEP
YOUR APARTMENT?

49:12.458 --> 49:15.625
- BECAUSE...

49:15.625 --> 49:21.333
I NEED SPACE...

49:21.333 --> 49:25.208
TO KEEP MY STUFF.

49:25.208 --> 49:28.125
- WE HAVE A HOUSE.

49:28.125 --> 49:29.041
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.

49:29.041 --> 49:31.709
- I THINK WHAT DEXTER
IS TRYING TO SAY

49:31.709 --> 49:33.500
IS THAT HE NEEDS SPACE
FOR HIMSELF

49:33.500 --> 49:34.917
IN THE MARRIAGE.

49:34.917 --> 49:36.250
- OKAY, YEAH,

49:36.250 --> 49:39.041
BUT I REALLY DO NEED A PLACE

49:39.041 --> 49:40.500
TO PUT MY STUFF.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.875
- OF COURSE.

49:41.875 --> 49:45.333
OF COURSE.
I'LL--I'LL GIVE YOU SPACE.

49:45.333 --> 49:47.709
- YOU WILL?

49:47.709 --> 49:50.250
- YES.

49:52.959 --> 49:54.417
- SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE HONEST?

49:54.417 --> 49:57.959
YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED.

49:57.959 --> 50:00.083
- [laughs]

50:19.542 --> 50:21.291
- I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

50:26.792 --> 50:29.625
- YOU ALWAYS CATCH ME.

50:39.500 --> 50:41.375
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

51:07.542 --> 51:10.917
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

51:10.917 --> 51:12.041
- MM.

51:12.041 --> 51:16.000
I'LL NEVER GET TIRED
OF HEARING THAT.

51:40.709 --> 51:41.500
- YOU LOOK BETTER.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.917
[pours coffee]

51:42.917 --> 51:45.625
- I FEEL BETTER.

51:45.625 --> 51:47.917
YOU KNOW WHY?

51:47.917 --> 51:49.208
NIKKI WALD DIDN'T KILL LUNDY.

51:50.875 --> 51:52.208
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

51:52.208 --> 51:54.166
'CAUSE SOMEBODY STOLE
LUNDY'S TRINITY RESEARCH.

51:54.166 --> 51:55.959
- ME.

51:55.959 --> 51:56.834
- AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO'D HAVE A REASON

51:56.834 --> 51:58.750
TO DO THAT.
- ME?

51:58.750 --> 52:00.375
- TRINITY.

52:00.375 --> 52:01.834
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

52:01.834 --> 52:05.083
- HE MUST HAVE REALIZED
LUNDY WAS GETTING CLOSE.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.792
THINK ABOUT IT.
THAT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.250
MAYBE HE EVEN SAW LUNDY STAKING
OUT THAT OFFICE BUILDING.

52:10.250 --> 52:12.458
- I GUESS.

52:12.458 --> 52:14.583
- HE KILLED LUNDY,
HE SHOT ME,

52:14.583 --> 52:16.750
HE STOLE LUNDY'S BOOKS
TO COVER HIS ASS.

52:16.750 --> 52:19.208
- NOT EXACTLY,
BUT YOU WERE ON A ROLL THERE

52:19.208 --> 52:20.250
FOR A WHILE.

52:20.250 --> 52:22.250
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW AWESOME THIS IS?

52:22.250 --> 52:23.583
IT MEANS THAT COCKSUCKER
IS STILL OUT THERE,

52:23.583 --> 52:24.709
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE
TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT

52:24.709 --> 52:26.208
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.917
I CAN GET HIM.

52:27.917 --> 52:29.083
- GREAT,
NOW I HAVE GOT TO WORRY

52:29.083 --> 52:31.166
ABOUT YOU GETTING
ON TRINITY'S RADAR.

52:31.166 --> 52:32.625
- HAVE YOU TOLD LAGUERTA
YOUR THEORY?

52:32.625 --> 52:33.792
- NOT YET.

52:33.792 --> 52:35.291
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
I HAVE A CASE FIRST.

52:35.291 --> 52:36.375
I DON'T WANT TO STEP
ON MY DICK.

52:36.375 --> 52:40.041
- NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

52:40.041 --> 52:41.625
- I GOT TO GET
TO THE STATION.

52:41.625 --> 52:42.709
LOTS OF WORK TO DO.

52:42.709 --> 52:45.083
BY THE WAY...

52:45.083 --> 52:46.917
I THINK I KNOW
WHO DAD WAS FUCKING.

52:48.709 --> 52:50.834
- WHAT?
WAIT, WHO?

52:50.834 --> 52:52.750
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN I KNOW MORE.

52:52.750 --> 52:55.375
I DON'T WANT TO STEP ON MY DICK
WITH THAT EITHER.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.875
- SO YOU READY?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.458
- I WAS BORN
OF PRIMORDIAL OOZE.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.834
I CRAWLED OUT
OF MY OWN MOTHER'S BLOOD.

53:19.291 --> 53:22.125
I HID AMONG THE HUMANS,
HOPING NOT TO BE SEEN.

53:22.125 --> 53:23.750
BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

53:23.750 --> 53:25.083
I GREW LEGS,

53:25.083 --> 53:30.125
STOOD UPRIGHT.

53:30.125 --> 53:31.834
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

53:31.834 --> 53:33.667
- ABSOLUTELY.

53:33.667 --> 53:35.500
[Rita grunts]

53:41.583 --> 53:42.709
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

53:42.709 --> 53:44.583
IS IT TOO STUFFY?

53:44.583 --> 53:49.208
- NOPE.

53:49.208 --> 53:50.959
[clicks button]

53:50.959 --> 53:54.208
[air-conditioning blows]

53:55.709 --> 53:57.417
IT'S PERFECT.

53:57.417 --> 53:59.208
THANK YOU.

53:59.208 --> 54:00.667
I BECAME A HUSBAND,

54:00.667 --> 54:02.625
A FATHER.

54:02.625 --> 54:03.959
I HAD TO EVOLVE.

54:03.959 --> 54:05.542
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO SURVIVE.

54:05.542 --> 54:10.208
- I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
I WANT TO GIVE YOU.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.166
- BEING MYSELF
IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY

54:12.166 --> 54:13.709
WILL TAKE
SOME GETTING USED TO,

54:13.709 --> 54:15.750
BUT ARTHUR WAS RIGHT.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.375
IT DOES FEEL...GOOD.

54:21.792 --> 54:24.083
- GOT IT.

54:24.083 --> 54:25.500
- A PADLOCK?

54:25.500 --> 54:26.583
- FOR THE DOOR.

54:26.583 --> 54:28.834
TO KEEP IT LOCKED.

54:28.834 --> 54:30.750
- SHOULDN'T I LEAVE IT OPEN?

54:30.750 --> 54:34.250
- PLEASE,
WE HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN.

54:34.250 --> 54:35.875
THERE'S DANGEROUS STUFF
IN THERE.
