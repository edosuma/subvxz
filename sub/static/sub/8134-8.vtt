00:23.057 --> 00:24.556
I think I'm
becoming a vampire.

[Simon screams]

I got the Cup.
I don't care about the Cup.

It just looks
like a wine glass.

There's nothing

No Downworlder can

The Cup is not safe here.
We have to give it
back to the Clave.

Give it back
to the Clave? No.

Look, I know how
powerful this Cup is.

It has the power
to create new Shadowhunters,

and even kill a mundane
if they drank from it.

[Alec] I'll go.
I'll tell 'em we
didn't find anything.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.284
Nobody will come down here.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.854

be a vampire...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.658

a good Catholic.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.466
[Isabelle] The vampires
breached the Accords.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.401
Killing Simon is
grounds for war.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.436
The vampires were
not behind this.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.140
Just Camille.
She attacked Simon
on her own.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.441
And how do we know
you're telling the truth?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.609
I could have gotten
rid of him,

04:37.611 --> 04:39.478
but instead I
brought him here.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.947
I don't want trouble
with the Shadowhunters.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.282
Smart decision.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.951
I warned the mundane
to stay away...

04:45.953 --> 04:47.719

a taste of her own blood,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.121
and like an addict...

04:49.623 --> 04:51.123
he came back wanting more.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.659
The only reason
Simon ever tasted

04:53.661 --> 04:55.460
Camille's blood
is because of you.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.331
You kidnapped him!
You drug him to Hotel DuMort.
You...

04:59.333 --> 05:00.565
You delivered him
to Camille!

There is a way.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.651
"A way" what?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.620
A way to bring
Simon back.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.255
[Clary] You can do that?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.357
How? How?

He's a fledgling.

[stammers] So I could
have Simon back?

Alive and breathing?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.103
That's just it.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.906
He won't return
alive or breathing.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.475
He'll be a vampire.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.011
[Jace]
And not the sexed up,
romantic kind.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.880

coffin-dwelling kind.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.015
That's offensive.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.083
Really?

05:51.719 --> 05:54.219
Coffin implies wooden box.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.389

They're made of 14-karat gold.

It's almost sunrise.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.964
Simon must be turned
into a vampire tonight
or staked through the heart.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.400
And if I do neither?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.036

trapped for eternity.

sunset to decide.

We weren't supposed to
see each other until
the ceremony, but you...

06:33.427 --> 06:34.960
you wouldn't listen
to rules.

You never did.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.434

And that's why I love you.

and that we would be
together forever.

with good news.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.584
Do you hear that, Jocelyn?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.953
Clarissa did it.

07:02.523 --> 07:06.825
It's evident she has
your determination
and my curiosity.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.031
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out, hmm?

07:14.535 --> 07:18.503
You left 18 years ago
with my unborn daughter.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.441
I guess we'll just
have to make up
for lost time, hmm?

07:24.478 --> 07:26.144
If she found the Cup...

07:27.214 --> 07:28.280
where is it?

07:28.282 --> 07:30.048
[Blackwell] She got back
to the Institute, sir.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.250
Lucian Graymark
got in the way.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.718
Got in the way how?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.821
He's the leader of
the New York pack now.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.556
She's under their protection.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.572

handling things.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.806
Oh, that's a joke, Maryse.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.042
You and I both know
how the Clave handles things.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.878

Sit.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.017
It's no surprise
Jace isn't here.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.118

08:07.120 --> 08:08.687
Said to start without him.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.988
I'm sure he has
a good reason.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.556
[Robert] Your mother and I...

08:12.659 --> 08:15.994
Okay, I requested
a meeting at the Clave

08:15.996 --> 08:18.830
to inform them that
the Seelies are siding
with Valentine.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.465
[sighs] And
the Clave denied it.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.001
What do you mean?
They don't want you
coming to Idris?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.636
There are rumors that
local Shadowhunters

08:24.638 --> 08:26.605
have been interfering
in Downworld affairs.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.274
But you two wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.476
<i> Nada.</i>
Nope.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.644
[Maryse]
Since all this happened
here in New York,

08:32.646 --> 08:34.346
under our command,

08:34.348 --> 08:36.147
they are concerned
with our devotion
to our job and the cause.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.682
But we're the Lightwoods.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.452
Remember, the honor
isn't in the name...

08:40.454 --> 08:41.620
it's in the deed.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.389
The Clave is sending
an envoy.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.491
[Maryse] Who will be
coming to observe us.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.793
And to gather information
about Valentine
to report back.

08:48.795 --> 08:52.631
But really to
scrutinize our leadership,
so I beg of the two of you,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.566
don't do anything that
would cause the Clave

08:54.568 --> 08:56.401
to lose even
more trust in us.

Simon would have
never even known
about the Shadow World.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.700
He would never have been
kidnapped by vampires.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.468
He wouldn't have met
Camille. He would...

09:32.105 --> 09:33.605
He wouldn't be dead.

two reprehensible choices...

09:43.550 --> 09:45.984

can't figure out
which one is worse.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.525
If I, uh...

if I bury Simon...

If Simon is buried
and he doesn't emerge...

10:07.941 --> 10:11.710
he would be trapped
under the earth...
starving for eternity.

Oh, my God.

And, uh...

10:21.755 --> 10:24.689
[stutters] if I...
if I stake him?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.125
He'll die a human death.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.394
It's painless,
as far as I know.

Simon, I'm so sorry.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.775
Alec, you think
you could get
my stele back?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.143
They took it away
because you nearly

10:45.145 --> 10:46.678
burnt down
the Mumbai Institute.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.414
How many times
do I have to say
it was an accident?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.582
Look, Max.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.653
[sighs] Somebody
very important is coming
to visit. All right?

10:54.655 --> 10:57.756
You think you can
stay out of trouble
for just a couple days?

If you do, I promise
I'll get your stele back.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.192
[door opens]

11:27.954 --> 11:30.722
That reaction time
was abysmal. [sighs]

to take temporary control
of this Institute.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.743
Wait a minute.
Nobody informed us.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.011
The Clave
doesn't need to.

11:53.013 --> 11:57.716
And, to repeat myself,
it's temporary.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.317
Nothing's been decided yet.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.987
But I do need full clearance
in order to assess

12:02.989 --> 12:05.090
how this Institute
is running.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.661
Where is Clary Fairchild?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.364
I would hope
someone here knows.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.999
She's in the field,
training.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.069
You're telling
me she's just...

12:18.071 --> 12:20.405
out and about
in the streets
of New York?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.007
Valentine's daughter?

12:23.009 --> 12:25.510
Isn't she also
your cousin?

12:25.512 --> 12:26.778
Distant cousin.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.581
She's with Jace.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.550
The same Jace Wayland
who decided to lead

12:32.552 --> 12:35.520
an unsanctioned raid
against the vampires?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.522
I've read reports.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.058
Jace might be unconventional,
but he's our best soldier.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.893
If he's with Clary,
then she's in good hands.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.961
I hope so.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.797
And for your sake,
all of New York.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.701
All of your jurisdiction
better be well protected.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.706
[snarling]

13:15.061 --> 13:16.895
[indistinct conversations]

13:20.467 --> 13:22.400
[banging]
[Luke shushes]

13:27.607 --> 13:28.807
[glass shattering]

13:31.912 --> 13:33.211
[growls]

13:41.755 --> 13:42.987
[growling]

13:48.328 --> 13:49.594
This is a bad idea.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.930
Promise me you won't
tell a mundane...
[sighs]

13:51.932 --> 13:53.298
...that Simon was
bitten by a vampire.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.532
I promise.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.501
Good.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.002
'Cause part of our
job as Shadowhunters

13:58.004 --> 13:59.604
is making sure
mundanes don't--

13:59.606 --> 14:00.672
Know the truth?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.507
Don't know anything
about the Shadow World.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.275
Don't worry,
I'm just gonna...

14:06.479 --> 14:08.980
tell her there's
an accident. [sighs]

14:08.982 --> 14:10.281
That, um...

14:11.685 --> 14:14.886
[sighs] that Simon's
not coming back.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.790
I owe his mother that much.
She loves him.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.992
[footsteps approaching]

14:20.994 --> 14:23.795
I haven't heard
anything from Simon
since yesterday, Clary.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.364
And he flipped out
on Rebecca and I.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.899
And then just disappeared.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.903
Have you heard from him?
Or have you seen him?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.472
Should I be calling
the police?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.540
No.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.941
No, don't do that. Um...

14:39.045 --> 14:40.812
If we needed to,
I would have called Luke.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.115
I just want to know
if he's all right.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.386
I saw him. [sighs]

14:48.388 --> 14:50.822
Oh, my God.
You did? Where?

14:51.591 --> 14:55.059
[stammering]
Where is he? Is he okay?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.964
No. [sighs]
Not exactly.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.368
[Elaine] Is it drugs?
I mean, he said that
it wasn't, but--

15:03.370 --> 15:05.470
[Clary] Uh, no,
it's not drugs. Um...

15:08.074 --> 15:09.540
Clary...
[sighs]

15:09.542 --> 15:11.943
Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.517
[sighs] Okay, look,
the truth is...

15:20.053 --> 15:21.786
[clatters]

15:28.028 --> 15:29.260
What...

15:33.533 --> 15:34.866
[Jace whispering]
What are you doing?

15:34.868 --> 15:36.968
[whispering] I don't know.
Okay, this is really hard.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.471
Be careful.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.806
I will.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.550
Simon got this for me
for Mother's Day.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.186
You know, 'cause he's
my little... monkey.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.725
Clary, I don't know
what I'd do if anything
happened to him.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.895
Rebecca and Simon,
they're all I have.

16:04.731 --> 16:08.132
After I lost their father...
[inhales sharply]

16:08.134 --> 16:09.334
[sniffles]

16:09.336 --> 16:11.569
[sighs]
But you were saying?

16:15.976 --> 16:18.076
To tell me the truth...

16:20.113 --> 16:23.047
Um... [swallows]

16:24.084 --> 16:25.350
[Isabelle]
I'm not a fan.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.018
Jealous?
No.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.520
[cell phone vibrates]
Maybe.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.522
How the hell did she
catch that arrow?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.161
[Alec] I have something
you need to see.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.030
Something attacked
the Jade Wolf.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.867
The werewolves' headquarters?
Where did you--

16:42.869 --> 16:44.168
Where did you get these?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.704
Leader of
the New York wolf pack.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.707
You're friends
with Lucian Graymark?
An ex-Circle member?

16:49.709 --> 16:53.511
How about we send
Isabelle and Alec
to investigate?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.179
I'm sure this is linked to--
[Lydia] Valentine.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.181
I need to see it for myself.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.755
Are you coming or what?

17:12.032 --> 17:13.097
Clary...

17:13.633 --> 17:15.033
what happened to the plan?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.902
Tell her that
Simon's not coming home.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.003
I tried, okay?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.405
I just... I can't.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.607
I'm not ready to just
give up on Simon.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.642
[sighs]

17:24.644 --> 17:26.411
Would you stop for a second,
think about what you're doing?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.912
I am, Jace, okay?

17:27.914 --> 17:29.881
[stutters] It's like my brain
is telling me to do one thing

17:29.883 --> 17:32.150
and my heart another and...

17:32.152 --> 17:33.217
[sighs]

17:35.155 --> 17:36.254
Okay. Look...

17:37.991 --> 17:39.390
there was a boy...

17:40.660 --> 17:44.529
and his father
bought him a falcon
for his sixth birthday.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.231
Are you seriously telling me
a story right now?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.433
Please, just listen.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.903
His father told him
to tame the bird.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.072
Make it obedient.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.840
That's crazy.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.109
And the boy would spend
every day with that falcon.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.179
It would scratch at him.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.380
Make him bleed.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.748
But eventually...

18:04.751 --> 18:06.217
he earned its trust.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.553
He brought the bird
to his father,

18:08.555 --> 18:11.189
to show him that the bird
would come back to him.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.226
He thought his father
would be proud.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.095
And he was, right?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.463
No, Clary.

18:18.465 --> 18:22.467
His father took the falcon
and snapped its neck.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.603
Okay, that is
the worst story
I have ever heard.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.305
You're missing the point.
[sighs]

18:27.307 --> 18:31.142
Yes... the boy
was devastated.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.113
But he realized
his father was right.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.182
He was told to
tame the bird...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.353
not to love it.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.891
That's why you have
to listen to your head.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.227
If I listened to my heart...

18:50.330 --> 18:52.063
I'd never be
able to do my job.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.099
Third rule
of Shadowhunting...

18:55.101 --> 18:57.168
emotions cloud judgment.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.737
Jace, if...

19:00.740 --> 19:03.975
if being a Shadowhunter
means that I have
to be dead inside...

19:05.678 --> 19:07.545
I'm not sure
I want to be one.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.792
I can see why all
the girls in Idris are
clamoring to meet you.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.927
What do you mean?

19:22.929 --> 19:25.463
Rumor has it
you're looking
to settle down...

19:25.465 --> 19:28.199
get married.
Damn it.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.700
Let me guess.
Not your idea?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.968
Not even close.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.171
My parents tried
to set me up, too.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.972
And how'd that work out?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.107
Not well for them.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.875
I made my own path.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.877
Married the love
of my life...

19:41.114 --> 19:42.346
John Monteverde.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.184
Together we were going to
run the Lisbon Institute.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.253
And then John was killed.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.790
Everything was
ripped away.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.293
My love, my dream job...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.997
Piece of advice... [sighs]

19:59.999 --> 20:01.566
In this line of work,

20:01.568 --> 20:04.535
the only thing worth
falling in love with
is the work itself.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.937
Lydia, I'm...

20:06.806 --> 20:07.872
I'm sorry.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.983
[Lydia] It's got
some characteristics
of a Forsaken.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.318
It was human.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.487
It was runed.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.555
[Luke] I don't know.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.757
It was more focused,
more determined.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.292
It attacked like
it had a plan.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.332
Plus, a normal Forsaken
wouldn't have been
so hard to kill.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.434
It took five wolves
to take that thing down.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.935
Never seen
anything like it.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.872
We'll take the body
back to the Institute,
do a full autopsy.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.442
Oh, hold up.
I get that I called you...

20:45.245 --> 20:46.877
Actually, I called Alec.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.313
But what I didn't want
is someone to come down
here and just take over.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.416
Yeah, that's
kind of her thing.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.755
Look, I know
I can come across...
abrasive.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.690
But we're all on
the same side here.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.592
Can we agree on that?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.428
The Institute
has the resources

21:04.430 --> 21:06.030
to find out
what this thing is.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.566
We have an expert
forensic pathologist.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.935
Highly trained
in all the creatures
of the Shadow World.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.804
[Lydia]
Do you have one here?

21:13.806 --> 21:16.274
In this, uh,
Chinese restaurant?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.378
Fine. You win.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.812
Just let me know
what you find.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.383
You think Valentine
was behind this?

21:25.385 --> 21:28.386
[scoffs] No question.
It's definitely his work.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.254
What do you think
he's after?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.455
[Luke] Honestly?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.591
Me.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.127
So you think
Valentine's going after
ex-Circle members?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.629
[Luke] I don't know.
It might be kind of personal.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.599
We have
a complicated past.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.801
But of course,
he could be going
after the old crew.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.436
I'm sure Valentine
has a grudge

21:45.438 --> 21:46.937
against anybody who
turned against him.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.440
We'll put extra wards
on the Institute.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.175
Right, for Hodge.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.843
And your parents.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.415
Did they conceal
that from you?

22:07.126 --> 22:09.560
We need to make sure
no magic was used
to make this.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.497
I'm calling
the nearest High Warlock
to come in to consult.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.565
Magnus Bane?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.535
To come here
to the Institute?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.571
Yes, is there a problem?

22:21.341 --> 22:24.375
No. Not at all.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.710
Magnus is, um...

22:26.646 --> 22:27.712
quite magical.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.882
He's, uh, very...
very good at magic.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.553
Do you know him well?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.689
Uh, just a little.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.625
I actually can't
wait to meet him.
[chuckles]

22:41.627 --> 22:44.862
Did you know that
my great ancestor,
Henry Branwell,

22:44.864 --> 22:47.198
who was the last
of the Branwells
to run an Institute,

22:47.200 --> 22:50.134
and Magnus Bane
invented the Portal?
[chuckles]

22:50.136 --> 22:51.369
No.

22:52.305 --> 22:54.472
Just add that to
the list of things
I didn't know.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.578
Alec. [sighs] I'm sorry.

23:01.914 --> 23:05.683
You shouldn't have had
to find out your parents
were ex-Circle members.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.218
Not like that.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.986
You mean from you?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.356
You shouldn't have been
the one I found out from.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.024
You know there's been
a ban about talking

23:14.026 --> 23:15.559
about the Circle till now.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.561
Yeah, how convenient
for my parents.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.097
This doesn't change how I
feel about the Lightwoods.

23:20.099 --> 23:23.267
Your family has always had
a strong alliance with mine.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.769
They've been a powerful force
in the Shadow World

23:24.771 --> 23:25.936
and praised for
their devotion.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.071
"Devotion"?

23:27.073 --> 23:29.473
My parents were
in league with Valentine.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.777
People make mistakes.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.612
Yeah, but this one...

23:35.548 --> 23:36.747
it's unforgivable.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.988
[bell chimes]

23:49.695 --> 23:51.462
Luke, are you okay?

23:51.464 --> 23:53.097
[Jace] What happened?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.633
Uh... you should see
the other guy.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.101
We were attacked
by a Forsaken,

23:57.103 --> 23:58.636
if you can even
call it that.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.438
Anyway, it's dead.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.274
It looks worse than it was.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.975
[sighs] Luke, you're hurt.
Uh, no.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.578
Already healed.
Perks of being a werewolf.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.046
Anyway, I called Alec.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.649
He took the Forsaken
back to the Institute
for an autopsy.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.451
We've got the best
forensic pathologist
in New York.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.052
Yeah, so I've heard.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.788
Clary, what are
you doing here?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.323
Now that you have the Cup,

24:19.325 --> 24:21.625
you know you should be
back at the Institute,
protected.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.060
I haven't taken
my eyes off her.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.795
I needed to see you.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.665
Luke, it's Simon.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.668
He's, um...
[swallows]

24:32.405 --> 24:33.804
Luke, he's dead.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.473
[shuddering]
Clary, I'm sorry.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.843
[Clary crying]

24:48.621 --> 24:49.854
[Isabelle] You almost done?

24:50.756 --> 24:52.590
Patience is a virtue,
my dear.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.659
[Isabelle] Come on.
I want to get my hands
on that thing.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.929
Speaking of which,
how is Alexander?

24:58.931 --> 25:00.531
I was hoping
I might hear from him.

25:00.533 --> 25:04.401
[sighs] Putrefaction.
It's decomposing.

25:05.137 --> 25:08.205
It's just so hard to tell
if Alexander is
even interested.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.641
I mean, I can't fathom
why he wouldn't be.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.543
I'm not sure
if you noticed,

25:12.544 --> 25:14.444
but my brother is not
exactly warm and fuzzy.

25:14.447 --> 25:17.548
Hmm, I suppose.
With Clary's arrival...

25:17.550 --> 25:18.682
And Valentine's return...

25:18.684 --> 25:20.951
Mmm-hmm.
Running the Institute...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.486
The envoy from
the Clave...

25:22.488 --> 25:24.388
Oh, who I hear is
very impressive.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.657
[sighs] What else?

25:26.659 --> 25:29.293
Oh. [scoffs]
Babysitting Jace.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.195
[chuckling]
And dealing with
our parents

25:31.197 --> 25:32.930
who are trying to
find him a wife.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.067
Sorry.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.637
It's quite all right.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.640
I suppose Alec is
just following his duty.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.844
Not everyone
gets the luxury of
following their heart.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.245
[sighs]

25:48.247 --> 25:50.714
I'm gonna go deliver
the preliminary findings.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.318
It seems like
you have everything
under control here.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.829
Luke, what do I do?

26:07.266 --> 26:09.133
If I bring Simon back then...

26:09.769 --> 26:11.936
He'll be a vampire.
A Downworlder.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.672
[echoing]

26:15.408 --> 26:17.274
[Luke grunting]

26:18.744 --> 26:20.010
It all happened so fast.

26:20.012 --> 26:23.113
[clears throat]
One minute,
Valentine was behind me.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.584
[grunts] The next,
he was gone and
the door was locked.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.786
But...
Valentine loves you.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.388
You're his  <i> parabatai,</i>
his brother.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.556
I know.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.291
If he could
do this to you...

26:34.293 --> 26:36.293
we have to stop him.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.461
Once you get better.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.729
[breathing heavily]

26:38.731 --> 26:40.331
I won't. [grunts]

26:41.534 --> 26:44.735
Luke, if you kill yourself,
he wins.

26:44.737 --> 26:48.172
And if I don't...
[breathing heavily]
I'll turn into a... [groans]

26:50.209 --> 26:51.609
What if I attack
you after I turn?

26:53.379 --> 26:56.380
If I hurt you...
I couldn't live with myself.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.817
You don't wanna hurt me.
Don't do this.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.152
Your death...
I couldn't survive that.

27:02.154 --> 27:05.389
[grunting] Jocelyn,
you have to go.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.724
I won't.
[grunts]

27:07.827 --> 27:09.393
You have to.
It's starting.
No.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.462
Look, please.
[breathing heavily]

27:15.334 --> 27:17.134
[yells]

27:17.136 --> 27:18.736
[Jocelyn] I can't
tell you what to do.

27:19.005 --> 27:21.639
But if you choose to live,
I hope you learn
to love yourself

27:21.641 --> 27:24.074
the way
I'll always love you.

27:29.582 --> 27:30.648
[Luke yells]

27:34.186 --> 27:35.919
[Luke sighs]
It wasn't easy going

27:35.921 --> 27:37.721
from a revered
Shadowhunter to a...

27:38.791 --> 27:39.823
werewolf.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.826
Suddenly,
I was foraging for food,

27:42.828 --> 27:44.528
unable to control
my own body.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.997
I lost my family...

27:48.034 --> 27:49.199
my friends.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.834
But not my mom.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.270
No.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.905
Jocelyn never abandoned me.

27:56.175 --> 28:00.077
Having you and Jocelyn
in my life kept me
from using this.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.847
Knowing that you
both needed me.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.750
I will never stop
needing you.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.755
[inhales] Clary...
you know I love
Simon like a son.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.192
If you decide
to bring him back,

28:15.194 --> 28:17.261
just know that his
journey won't be easy.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.233
So make sure you
do it for him...

28:23.235 --> 28:24.902
and not yourself.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.471
[sighs]

28:31.143 --> 28:32.609
The sun is setting.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.245
Have you decided?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.264
[thudding]
[chain rattling]

28:54.934 --> 28:56.633
[breathing heavily]

29:07.680 --> 29:08.912
Magnus.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.714
[Alec panting]

29:10.716 --> 29:12.516
Okay, I'm back.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.855
Oh, you don't have to
get dressed up for me.

29:19.692 --> 29:21.258
Fine.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.826
But I liked what I saw.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.996
I have the preliminary
autopsy findings.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.632
Why are you
giving this to me?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.000
This should go to the
head of the Institute.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.969
And it is.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.471
I'm not.
And I never will be.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.374
Magnus, it's like...

29:38.477 --> 29:41.478
it's like my whole life...
has been a lie.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.781
Now, everything
I've ever known is...

29:43.783 --> 29:45.983
It's not what you thought.
[sighs]

29:45.985 --> 29:49.052
I've done everything
for my parents...

29:49.922 --> 29:51.822
for the Clave and...

29:51.824 --> 29:53.657
[breathing heavily]

29:53.659 --> 29:55.959
[stutters]
I've done everything
that they've asked.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.462
Maybe you should start
living for yourself.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.833
Do what's in your heart.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.170
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

30:06.172 --> 30:09.406
[breathes deeply]
I think you're right.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.936
[rustling]

30:46.045 --> 30:47.377
What do you want?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.414
I want my property back.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.983
Simon is not
your property.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.019
If you'll just hand him over,
I'll be on my way.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.488
You heard Clary.
You're not laying
a hand on him.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.525
Fine. I tried to do
this the nice way.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.132
Jace.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.435
I'm glad you brought
everyone here to
witness your demise.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.638
Camille killed
this mundane.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.406
Now, I have
all the proof.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.476
She's been
breaking the Accords
for too long now.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.511
He's the evidence
we need to show the Clave

31:21.513 --> 31:22.846
what Camille
has been doing.

31:22.848 --> 31:23.981
[chuckles]

31:24.917 --> 31:27.651
Are you trying
to overthrow me?

31:27.653 --> 31:28.719
No.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.721
I already have.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.323
Don't listen to him.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.826
Raphael doesn't know
the first thing
about leading.

31:35.828 --> 31:40.597
You need me.
I've given you everything
you could want.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.033
All the riches.
All the pleasures
you could desire.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.835
[Raphael]
By breaking the law.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.604
Which will only destroy us.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.606
We can fix this.

31:49.608 --> 31:53.510
If we just get
rid of the body,
this mundane means nothing.

31:55.214 --> 31:59.182
"Means nothing"?
Over my dead body.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.118
[grunts]

32:03.422 --> 32:04.955
[vampires hissing]

32:09.395 --> 32:10.794
[Lydia] The Clave has spoken.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.930
They will be
taking full control
of the Institute.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.032
[Maryse] I'm begging you.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.133
You can punish us,
but our children
did nothing wrong.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.302
They've worked so hard--

32:18.304 --> 32:20.437
I'm sorry,
there's nothing
I can do.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.472
With everything
that's happened
here in New York,

32:22.474 --> 32:24.942
plus your history
with the Circle,

32:24.944 --> 32:26.109
and now Valentine's return,

32:26.111 --> 32:28.245
the Clave believes
the Institute's at risk.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.815
We've been trying
to stop Valentine.
What has the Clave done?

32:31.817 --> 32:33.216
The answer is nothing.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.718
He's growing in strength.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.054
They're more concerned
about removing us
from the Institute.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.455
Robert.
[Lydia] The law's hard...

32:38.457 --> 32:40.123
but it is the law.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.527
We will await
the Clave's instructions.

32:44.897 --> 32:46.930
I have the preliminary
results from Magnus.

32:46.932 --> 32:49.533
No magic was used
in creating the Forsaken.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.171
I'll take them.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.120
[Raphael] Clary...

33:10.122 --> 33:11.421
it's time.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.325
Which will it be?

33:34.113 --> 33:35.412
[exhales]

33:53.132 --> 33:54.531
[Clary sobs]

33:54.533 --> 33:56.466
When your grandfather
gave you this

33:56.468 --> 33:58.268
at your bar mitzvah,
you, um...

33:59.471 --> 34:01.138
you told me how much
it meant to you.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.242
It was a symbol of the day
you became a man.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.780
[crying] Simon...

34:11.183 --> 34:13.283
Simon, no matter
what happens...

34:14.253 --> 34:15.719
no matter what...

34:17.089 --> 34:18.422
you become...

34:21.260 --> 34:23.727
you will always
be that man to me.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.116
Lydia, do you
have a minute?

35:19.118 --> 35:22.452
Alec,
I'm sorry about your parents,
but my hands were tied.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.387
Look, I... I know.

35:24.389 --> 35:29.092
The law is hard,
but it's the law,
and I respect that.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.428
But I've realized that...

35:31.430 --> 35:33.330
I have to listen
to my heart.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.632
[chuckles]
Let's not forget
where that got me.

35:35.634 --> 35:39.736
I know. [stutters]
And I can't bring
John back.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.908
But, like you said,
our families have
been strong allies.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.145
And we can use that
to our advantage.

35:49.114 --> 35:53.083
Together, we can restore
my family name and
we can keep the Institute.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.520
And we'd get to run it.

36:03.095 --> 36:05.295
Lydia Branwell...

36:05.297 --> 36:08.231
will you marry me,
Alec Lightwood?

36:15.307 --> 36:16.439
That mundane's a fighter.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.309
He survived the vampires
at the Hotel DuMort.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.345
He survived
the werewolves
at Jade Wolf.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.547
He survived accounting...

36:24.383 --> 36:25.782
for whatever that's worth.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.185
He is a fighter,
isn't he?

36:29.788 --> 36:33.290
Look, I know you think
emotions cloud judgment...

36:33.292 --> 36:35.058
and that whole
falcon story,

36:35.060 --> 36:36.660
I... I don't think
I'll ever be able

36:36.662 --> 36:38.428
to wrap my head
around that, but...

36:41.366 --> 36:44.634
all of that contradicts
the first rule of
being mundane.

36:46.138 --> 36:48.405
What's the first rule
of being mundane?

36:48.407 --> 36:51.241
[sighs] It's that love
makes you stronger.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.245
It was my mother's love
for me that made her

36:55.247 --> 36:57.447
betray Valentine
and steal the Cup.

36:59.518 --> 37:03.220
It's love that makes
you fight harder
for what you want.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.427
[rustling]
[ground rumbling]

37:15.867 --> 37:17.100
It's happening.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.908
[breathing heavily]

37:38.357 --> 37:39.956
[Clary] Simon.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.125
Simon, it's me.
It's... it's Clary.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.430
[hisses]
[Clary screams]

37:49.067 --> 37:51.868
Once reborn,
you emerge hungry.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.203
[breathing heavily]

37:58.377 --> 38:00.277
Very hungry.
[Simon panting]

38:02.648 --> 38:03.947
Drink up.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.230
Nephilim.

38:25.237 --> 38:28.405
Why would you
have angel blood?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.382
Oh, my God.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.331
[grunting]

39:01.940 --> 39:03.506
[both grunting]

39:33.672 --> 39:35.071
[breathing heavily]

39:35.073 --> 39:37.140
[grunting]

39:47.352 --> 39:48.752
[Hodge panting]

39:49.588 --> 39:50.787
[grunts]

39:54.326 --> 39:55.425
[grunts]

40:01.099 --> 40:02.465
[grunting]

40:07.873 --> 40:09.339
[footsteps approaching]

40:10.342 --> 40:12.642
Oh, my God!
Alec, are you okay?

40:13.912 --> 40:15.345
[breathing heavily]

40:16.415 --> 40:17.614
[softly] Oh, my God.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.418
[Simon breathing erratically]

40:23.588 --> 40:24.454
Clary...

40:25.557 --> 40:27.624
[stutters]
what's happening?

40:29.561 --> 40:33.163
You, um... you died.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.632
I what?

40:36.134 --> 40:37.767
What's this? [gasps]

40:37.769 --> 40:39.269
That's blood!

40:42.574 --> 40:43.840
Oh, my--

40:44.476 --> 40:46.576
Oh, my-- [spits]

40:46.578 --> 40:47.977
[breathing heavily]
Why can't I say--

40:47.979 --> 40:49.646
[Simon sputters]
God.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.849
It'll take time to
regain the ability.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.084
There's a lot you
will need to learn.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.954
[shuddering] Oh, my--

40:57.956 --> 40:59.322
Damn it!

40:59.324 --> 41:01.991
[shuddering] Am I...

41:04.830 --> 41:06.229
Am I a vampire?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.466
Yeah.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.236
[stutters] Clary, tell me...
tell me this isn't real.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.671
Tell me this is
not really happening!

41:14.673 --> 41:16.573
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry!

41:16.575 --> 41:18.575
I'm...

41:18.577 --> 41:21.644
I'm... I'm repulsive!
[Clary stutters] No, please...

41:21.646 --> 41:23.580
please don't
say that, okay?

41:23.582 --> 41:25.748
[breath trembling]
You're still the same, Simon.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.751
You're the same Simon
I've known my whole life.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.988
The same guy who...
[stutters] loves sci-fi.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.257
And who can recite
every line from...

41:34.259 --> 41:35.859
from every Nicolas Cage movie.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.496
[sobbing] The same Simon
who carried me over

41:39.498 --> 41:41.464
the Brooklyn Bridge
when I lost my shoe, okay?

41:41.466 --> 41:42.932
Listen--
No, Clary, I'm not!

41:42.934 --> 41:44.534
[Clary]
Yes, you are, Simon!

41:44.536 --> 41:47.136
[yelling]
You are the same Simon!
You are my best friend!

41:47.138 --> 41:48.505
I'm not.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.975
I'm nothing more
than a monster.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.977
No, Simon, you--

41:53.979 --> 41:55.678
Stay away!
Please just...

41:56.648 --> 41:57.714
stay away.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.883
Simon...

42:05.657 --> 42:06.856
I'll look after Simon.

42:08.126 --> 42:09.459
You have my word.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.532
What did I do?

42:19.170 --> 42:20.303
What did I do?

42:20.305 --> 42:21.638
[crying]
