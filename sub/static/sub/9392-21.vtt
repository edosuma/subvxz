Wow, congratulations on your
grand re-opening, Mort.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.709
Looks like your customers
are comin' back.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.845
Thanks, Lois. It's good
to be up and gouging again.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.847
Oh, careful.
Watch out there, Brian.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.149
Looks like the floor is wet.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.650
Excuse me.
I'm kind of in a hurry

00:51.652 --> 00:53.685
(screams)
Son of a bi!

00:53.687 --> 00:55.154
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

00:55.156 --> 00:57.790
I'm sorry. I've been
a little distracted lately.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.758
I think my wife has
been crossing the street

00:59.760 --> 01:01.193
with another man.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.196
God, I hope Alan
doesn't find out.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.098
Hey, forget that klutz.

01:07.967 --> 01:11.136
Hmm, maybe this one.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.639
Hey. Lookin' at you
pretty normal, huh?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.207
No!

01:15.209 --> 01:16.341
Aw, fudge.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.843
Wait, I know!

01:20.480 --> 01:21.847
I'll figure this out.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.615
Th-the pieces are all there.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.017
I-I'll go home
and figure this out.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.921
Aw, cool. Hey Mort,
what's this thing?

01:28.923 --> 01:31.590
Oh, that? That's my
"Come In! We're Open" sign.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.925
What's that,
like an iPad?

01:32.927 --> 01:34.460
No, it's a sign.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.028
Wish I had one of those.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.329
I've got a whole box
of them.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.131
Take it. It's yours.
No charge.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.567
Ugh, typical Jew.

01:45.138 --> 01:46.605
TV ANNOUNCER:
Coming this fall

01:46.607 --> 01:48.373
from the producers
of   <i>Gone BabyGone,</i>

01:48.375 --> 01:50.175
comes the riveting sequel:

01:50.177 --> 01:53.145
<i>Gone Severely Disabled</i>
<i>Baby Gone.</i>

01:53.147 --> 01:55.714
I promise you we are going
to find your daughter.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.016
Okay, but, you know,
do-do what you can,

01:58.018 --> 01:59.918
but seriously, don't,
like, kill yourself.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.588
Oh, and if you do find her,
honk this horn a couple times.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.023
It's the only way to get her
to stop biting you.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.592
But again, no rush.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.027
(knocking)

02:10.363 --> 02:12.131
Peter, what
are you doing?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.665
I'm just putting up
my new sign.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.933
Don't put that thing
on our door.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.201
If you want to hang it
somewhere,

02:16.203 --> 02:17.769
hang it in the basement.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.105
Oh, why? So you can hog it
while you're doing laundry?

02:20.107 --> 02:21.840
No way.
Peter, we're not a business.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.109
Hey, I saw your sign.
So, you're open?

02:24.111 --> 02:25.444
That's right.
What do you do?

02:25.446 --> 02:26.812
What do you need?
Milk.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.247
We have milk.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.255
Peter, I told you,
I don't like

02:36.257 --> 02:38.590
all these strangers
walking around in our house.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.360
They're not strangers, Lois;
they are our valued customers.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.695
And if we don't show them
we appreciate their loyalty,

02:43.697 --> 02:46.131
they're gonna go
someplace else.
For what?!

02:46.133 --> 02:47.099
Not to alarm anyone,

02:47.101 --> 02:48.834
but some guy took me
in the closet

02:48.836 --> 02:50.135
and tried me on.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.638
She's right, Dad.
None of this makes any sense.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.939
Meg, go take your ten.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.607
And you may consider this
a verbal warning.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.342
Peter, I want
these people to le.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.877
I fit,
by the way.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.212
Lois, I'd love nothing more

03:00.214 --> 03:01.613
than to sit here
and chat with you,

03:01.615 --> 03:02.948
but I have a business to run.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.816
Hi there.
May I help you folks?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.919
Yes, my family and I would like
our portrait painted.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.887
Well, you came
to the right place.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.028
Looking good.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.262
Almost done.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.264
And... there.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.732
Done.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.002
What have you done?!

03:24.004 --> 03:26.038
I painted the truth.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.839
I painted my truth.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.779
Gimme a spin, sweetie.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.047
What do you think, Mom?

03:35.049 --> 03:37.115
Is that the most beautiful
bride you've ever seen?

03:37.117 --> 03:38.116
I love it!

03:38.118 --> 03:39.785
Oh, it's just
so much money.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.320
It's true. It's true.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.487
Take the dress off,
sweetheart.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.022
Your mother says
you can't have it.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.257
W-wait, wait,
wait a minute.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.458
Do you really love it?

03:46.460 --> 03:49.027
I do. It just feels
like my wedding dress.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.430
Oh, Mom, she loves it.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.931
Okay.
We'll take it.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.001
Peter, what is that girl doing
in my wedding dress?!

03:56.003 --> 03:58.036
PETER:
She gone?
No.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.438
Okay, well, while
I'm down here

03:59.440 --> 04:01.139
let me give you my card.

04:01.141 --> 04:01.740
There you go.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.147
Here you go. A half pound of
honey maple turkey, sliced thin.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.782
I wanted a
duplicate key made.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.950
You have a good one.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.352
Oh, hey, Joe.
What's going on?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.121
Peter, I'm afraid
I'm here to shut you down.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.990
You're running an
unlicensed business,

04:17.992 --> 04:19.358
and that's against the law.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.093
Aw, that is such bullcrap.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.794
Well, you can't fight
City Hall.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.763
Oh, we'll see about that!

04:27.166 --> 04:28.934
City Hall knows karate.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.470
I'm sorry, Peter, but the
government makes the rules.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.604
I just enforce them.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.805
I don't believe this, Joe.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.007
This is like
living in Russia.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.308
I might as well
just move there.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.709
You don't want to do that.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.678
It's dark; it's cold;
and hooking up

04:39.680 --> 04:42.014
is just a crapshoot
'cause of all the big coats.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.549
All right, drop
the coats on three.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.485
One... two...

04:46.487 --> 04:47.452
three!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.087
Yeah!
Oh...

04:52.759 --> 04:54.926
Hey, you ever
accidentally masturbate

04:54.928 --> 04:56.461
to young pictures
of your mom?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.697
Who the (bleep) starts
a conversation like that?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.132
I just sat down.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.800
Geez, what's
your problem, Peter?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.001
I'm sorry, Quagmire.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.037
I'm still just upset
about the damn government

05:05.039 --> 05:06.805
sticking its nose
in my business.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.973
I hear ya.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.442
Wasting our tax dollars
on ridiculous causes.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.943
We gotta protect
bald eagles?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.212
Bald eagles should be allowed
to make their own decisions!

05:16.049 --> 05:18.684
Honey, I don't care
that you're bald.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.285
I find you
just as attracti.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.653
It's not about you.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.923
It's about my confidence
as an eagle architect.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.124
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Just for Eagles will give you</i>

05:26.126 --> 05:28.360
<i>thicker, fuller,</i>
<i>more natural hair...</i>

05:28.362 --> 05:31.096
<i>so you can just focus</i>
<i>on eagle stuff.</i>

05:31.098 --> 05:33.498
You're an
excellent architect.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.501
Freakin' government.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.103
Giving all the
good hoses to firemen.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.438
I want them hoses.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.106
ANCHORMAN:
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.341
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.975
Coming up: Autism:

05:43.977 --> 05:45.844
Is it real
or just another excuse

05:45.846 --> 05:47.846
for kids these days
to forget their manners?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.881
But first, thousands
are expected

05:49.883 --> 05:51.216
for tomorrow's
Tea Party rally

05:51.218 --> 05:53.318
celebrating their new
Quahog headquarters.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.519
That's right, Joyce.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.321
The Tea Party has gained
a sizable following

05:56.323 --> 05:58.123
based on their message
of low taxes,

05:58.125 --> 06:00.492
limited government,
and happy birthday, Tom...

06:00.494 --> 06:03.128
Oh, my God, you guys!

06:03.130 --> 06:04.429
Tea Party, huh?

06:04.431 --> 06:06.665
Well, I'd like to be
part of a movement,

06:06.667 --> 06:09.034
but what movement would want
an angry fat guy

06:09.036 --> 06:11.136
with a lot of opinions
who hates listening?

06:11.138 --> 06:13.004
For more details
on the Tea Party platform,

06:13.006 --> 06:15.974
we now go to this
totally boss fireworks show.

06:15.976 --> 06:20.112
♪

06:23.649 --> 06:25.183
Oh, my God! That's everything
I believe in!

06:25.185 --> 06:28.320
Why are they trying
to take that away from us?
I hear ya.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.488
Well, that's it.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.156
I am going down
to that rally tomorrow

06:31.158 --> 06:32.858
and I am joining
the Tea Party!

06:32.860 --> 06:35.527
Oh, wait, that's the same time
as my men's knitting club,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.863
although they have been
really critical lately.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.334
You're still not knitting
honestly, Peter.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.269
You're knitting like
you want us to like you.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.837
It's not coming from inside.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.439
It's very superficial.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.808
Thank you!
You've made my decision easier!

06:49.810 --> 06:51.710
Yes! That! Knit that!

06:58.017 --> 07:00.051
Good Tea Party morning,
everyone!

07:00.053 --> 07:01.853
Peter, you joined
the Tea Party?!

07:01.855 --> 07:03.021
That's right, Brian.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.322
I finally got something
better to do

07:04.324 --> 07:06.124
with my Saturdays
than sit at the mall

07:06.126 --> 07:09.094
and watch Japanese girls
laugh at normal conversation.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.129
So, I drove to work
this morning...

07:11.131 --> 07:12.998
(all giggling)

07:13.000 --> 07:14.366
And I had to stop
for coffee.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.034
(all giggling)

07:16.036 --> 07:18.270
So, there's a Starbucks
near my house.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.606
(all laughing)

07:21.608 --> 07:23.275
You people
are a circus.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.343
Finally, I'm part of
a movement of regular people

07:25.345 --> 07:27.179
trying to take back
our government.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.480
Look, the Tea Party isn't

07:28.482 --> 07:30.215
the grassroots movement
you think it is.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.783
It's actually funded
by Big Business types

07:31.785 --> 07:34.152
who are using you to get
the government out of their way

07:34.154 --> 07:35.921
so they can roll over
everyone.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.457
Mom held hands with a woman
at the gas station this morning.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.126
Don't know what that means.
Just reporting it.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.794
All I'm saying is
you're being used

07:42.796 --> 07:44.095
and you're too clueless
to know it.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.798
Boy, you just think
you're so superior, don't you?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.434
Like that first creature
to walk on dry land.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.003
Hey, where'd you go?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.939
Ah, I went for a jog.
What's a jog?

07:53.941 --> 07:56.808
It's a great way to stay
in shape is what it is.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.143
Is it like a swim?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.611
(laughing condescendingly)

07:59.613 --> 08:02.180
No, no, it's, it's
nothing like a swim.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.519
Wow, a lot of people here today.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.921
Yeah. Man,
I love street fairs.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.959
and ethnic food cooked horribly
by white Americans.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.161
Tack-os!
Hot tack-os here!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.863
Oh, are those tack-os?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.865
You better believe
they're tack-os.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.333
I love tack-os!

08:21.335 --> 08:22.968
Especially on a
corn tor-tilla.

08:22.970 --> 08:27.038
Oh! I love tack-os
on a corn tor-tilla!

08:29.342 --> 08:31.443
Boy, they're really
against socialism.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.145
That's right. The Tea Party
is all about self-reliance.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.214
Look, there's even
a Tunnel of Self-Love.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.092
Would you like to buy a photo
of yourself on the ride, sir?

08:47.094 --> 08:47.959
No, I would not.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.461
Welcome, everyone!

08:49.463 --> 08:52.464
It's great to see
so many regular people out here.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.599
Folks who are tired
of big government

08:54.601 --> 08:56.434
and are ready to stand up
for their rights.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.370
Yeah!
Down with
the Spend-o-crats!

08:58.372 --> 08:59.604
PETER:
We are Marshall!

08:59.606 --> 09:01.506
And now, it's my privilege

09:01.508 --> 09:04.676
to introduce another regular,
blue-collar guy,

09:04.678 --> 09:08.680
our Quahog chapter spokesman:
Joe Workingman!

09:08.682 --> 09:10.015
(cheering and applause)

09:12.051 --> 09:15.153
Good afternoon, friends
and socioeconomic equals!

09:15.155 --> 09:17.589
Is anyone else out there
sick of government crap?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.024
Oh, my God.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.626
It's like he's saying everything
I'm listening to.

09:21.628 --> 09:22.961
That's right.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.996
The government wants to tell you
what foods to eat.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.531
(booing)

09:26.533 --> 09:28.133
And what church
you can go to.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.834
(booing)

09:29.836 --> 09:31.770
And that you can't
own a chimpanzee

09:31.772 --> 09:33.104
because you're not
responsible enough.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.839
(booing)

09:34.841 --> 09:36.007
I would feed it!

09:36.009 --> 09:37.876
Also, the government
wants to tell you

09:37.878 --> 09:39.377
how many children
you can have.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.212
What?! No!

09:41.214 --> 09:42.881
And the government
wants to tell you

09:42.883 --> 09:44.950
you can't throw
your old TVs into the river.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.652
Then how I supposed
to find TV?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.855
If you join the Tea Party,
together, we can fix all that.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.024
But you probably don't wanna
join the Tea Party

09:53.026 --> 09:58.096
because all you get are these
stupid, awesome keychains!

09:58.098 --> 10:01.333
Oh, my God, it's the keychain
from the dream!

10:04.503 --> 10:06.972
I got to say that guy
made a lot of sense.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.974
He sure did. The government's
really gotten outta hand.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.209
Yeah, those bastards
have ruined everything.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.678
The same way the Village People
ruined any gathering

10:13.680 --> 10:16.014
of a cop, an Indian chief,
and a construction worker.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.050
Oh, my God, can we get
a picture with you guys?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.118
We're not those guys.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.786
Yes, pleae
leave us al.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.588
We're very busy.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.256
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.292
We've gotta solve
that security problem

10:27.294 --> 10:29.661
for the Indian Casino
we're constructing.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.096
Hey, you guys want
to head to the Clam?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.098
I'll catch up with you.
I got to hit the john.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.639
Hey, buddy. Is there
a bathroom around here,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.073
or a second floor window?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.376
(gasps)
Carter?!

10:44.378 --> 10:45.977
Oh... hey.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.545
You're involved
with the Tea Party?

10:47.547 --> 10:48.713
Wait a minute.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.281
This is what Brian
was warning me about:

10:50.283 --> 10:52.150
that the Tea Party
is run by rich guys

10:52.152 --> 10:53.618
who are only out for themselves.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.853
Brian?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.022
You mean that arrogant,
unemployed dog of yours?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.124
Peter, he's just one
of those liberal elites

10:59.126 --> 11:00.925
who spreads lies
and hates patriots.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.460
Yeah, he kinda is.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.497
You and I are both businessmen
who work hard and pay taxes.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.666
Except that I make
10,000 times what you make.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.668
Yeah, we're the same,
you and me.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.036
You know, Peter, the truth is,

11:11.038 --> 11:12.937
I could actually use
a regular guy like you

11:12.939 --> 11:14.005
to help get our message out,

11:14.007 --> 11:17.208
and I know
Joe Workingman agrees with me.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.044
Love to have you
on board, Peter.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.846
Wow, thanks, Joe.
You can count on me.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.782
Aw, Carter, you just missed
Joe Workingman.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.949
(laughs)

11:24.951 --> 11:26.951
Oh, I think he'll
know I was here.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.921
(laughing)

11:29.923 --> 11:31.423
(laughing maniacally)

11:31.425 --> 11:34.059
(chuckling nervously)

11:37.163 --> 11:39.230
I'm not sure
what's happening.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.102
Oh, hi, Peter.
How was your rally?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.637
Oh, it was great,
and now I know

11:45.639 --> 11:46.938
it's the right cause
to get behind

11:46.940 --> 11:49.307
'cause a smart guy
like your dad is involved.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.176
What, Carter was
at the Tea Party rally?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.610
Yeah, he was running
the whole thing.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.512
Peter, what did I tell you
about rich guys?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.281
Look, I know what
you're thinking, Brian,

11:56.283 --> 11:57.449
but don't worry;
it's all okay.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.883
Turns out
you're the enemy.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.185
They're the ones
who are on our side.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.953
Oh, of course,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.422
an industrialist with
oil refineries in this city,

12:04.424 --> 12:05.757
is on your side.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.325
He wants to get rid
of environmental regulations

12:07.327 --> 12:08.426
for you.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.794
Brian, he doesn't
get sarcasm.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.030
No, it's not just environmental
regulations, Brian.

12:12.032 --> 12:12.964
Carter wants
to get rid

12:12.966 --> 12:15.133
of the whole city government
of Quahog.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.036
He even put me in charge
of the PR campaign to do it.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.337
Get rid of the government?

12:19.339 --> 12:22.173
Peter, if I know my dad,
he's probably using you.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
Lois, I'm so glad
you're done with the dishes

12:24.111 --> 12:25.844
so that you can hang out
and chime in on this.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.012
Actually, Peter, I
haven't done the dishes.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.047
Oh, you haven't?

12:29.049 --> 12:30.615
Well, then,
I'm confused.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.050
Oh, he does get sarcasm.

12:35.621 --> 12:36.654
All right,
now, remember,

12:36.656 --> 12:38.523
the Tea Party is a
grassroots movement.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.625
We're not covered by
the lame-stream media,

12:40.627 --> 12:42.961
so we got to reach out to
the common man individually.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.997
Right, common man.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.599
WOMAN:
Hello.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.535
Ah, geez, it's... it's a girl.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.437
May I speak to the man
of the house?

12:52.439 --> 12:55.707
This is the woman of the house,
and there is no man living here.

12:55.709 --> 12:56.975
No?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.944
W-W-What is... I-I... how are
you paying for this phone?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.013
I'm a lawyer.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.015
Oh, I see, and are you
in your little courthouse

13:04.017 --> 13:05.850
right now
representing Barbie?

13:05.852 --> 13:06.985
(click, dial tone)

13:06.987 --> 13:09.053
Okay, one vote
for the Tea Party.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.989
All right, kiss
government good-bye.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.625
Yeah, I can't wait to fire
all them city employees,

13:13.627 --> 13:16.227
starting with that half-asleep
construction worker.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.804
W-W-Which one is it--
stop or go forward?

13:25.806 --> 13:26.805
This is a big deal.

13:26.807 --> 13:27.939
They're not at all similar.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.043
Ah, no, no, no, no.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.078
You, sir, have lost my business.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.050
("Yankee Doodle Dandy" playing)

13:57.937 --> 14:02.006
(crowd jeering)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.375
People, please,
first things first.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.612
Is there anyone here
for the couch off of Craigslist?

14:07.614 --> 14:08.379
I am.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.448
Oh, good, come on in.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.354
That <i>is</i> the picture
from Craigslist.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.355
No way it is.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.323
It is.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.992
No way it is.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.927
All right, what do
the rest of you want?

14:22.929 --> 14:24.963
We want the city government
shut down.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.965
(cheering)

14:26.967 --> 14:28.366
Oh, I see.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.869
And all of you feel
the same way?

14:30.871 --> 14:31.970
ALL:
Yes!
MAN:
No!

14:31.972 --> 14:34.005
(gunshot)
ALL:
Yes!

14:34.007 --> 14:36.541
Well, I'm nothing
if not a public servant,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.776
and the public has made
its feelings known.

14:38.778 --> 14:43.181
I hereby declare Quahog's
city government disbanded.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.383
(cheering)

14:45.385 --> 14:50.421
It has been my pleasure to serve
you, and now I take my leave.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.625
This column is mine.

14:53.627 --> 14:56.027
I brought it from home.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.167
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.304
Our top story: Quahog is now
completely government-free,

15:06.306 --> 15:09.707
which means I'm free
of all broadcast regulations,

15:09.709 --> 15:11.943
so no more trips to the bathroom
for this reporter,

15:11.945 --> 15:14.712
just a big-ass coffee can
under the desk.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.052
Hello, family.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.054
Peter, what the hell
were you doing out there?

15:23.056 --> 15:25.623
You know, for years I've been
sick of taking the roads home,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.091
so today I took the yards.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.192
Didn't hit one light.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.827
Man, getting rid
of the government has been

15:29.829 --> 15:32.196
the best thing to happen
around here in a long time.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.765
That's right.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.000
Without government I'm free
to take a lot of mescaline

15:36.002 --> 15:38.169
and drive to Vegas.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.808
Wait till you see
Debbie Reynolds on stage.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.543
Yeah, and now
my Spanish teacher and I

15:45.545 --> 15:47.612
can finally hold hands
in the halls.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.181
<i>¿Meg, dónde está</i>
<i>la biblioteca?</i>

15:50.183 --> 15:52.984
Because I'm going to bang you
in the <i>biblioteca.</i>

15:52.986 --> 15:54.886
Well, I'm glad you're all
enjoying your freedom,

15:54.888 --> 15:57.055
but have you taken a look
out the window lately?

15:59.258 --> 16:00.291
What is that?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.926
Where's all that
smoke coming from?

16:01.928 --> 16:04.162
The Pewterschmidt Industries
refinery,

16:04.164 --> 16:07.131
and it's not smoke;
it's a giant cloud of pollution.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.366
Oh, my God.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.135
If that gets past the bad
neighborhoods and reaches us,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.004
that's going to be
a big problem.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.005
They can't do that.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.039
We should report them.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.341
To who?
There's no government.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.344
Then it's up to us, the
people, to find a solution.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.279
Close the curtains.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.780
Ah, Tea Party.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.316
Damn it, this is what I was
afraid was going to happen.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.452
This town is going
to go to hell.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.120
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.189
You may kiss
the bride.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.759
I'm glad we waited.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.162
(bleating)

16:39.932 --> 16:41.933
Giraffity.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.668
Yeah, see,
that's not mine.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.937
Hey, Mort, what gives
with the blond hair?

16:45.939 --> 16:47.872
Yeah, you look
weird like that.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.808
Historically, in instances
of mass lawlessness,

16:50.810 --> 16:54.112
the first thing they do
is round up the Jews.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.948
Excuse me, fellow Aryan,
have you seen any Jews around?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.149
Is there a reward?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.351
Wait a minute.
Are you Jewish?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.788
I mean, uh,
unashamed locker room nudity.

17:03.790 --> 17:04.989
This guy's kosher.

17:04.991 --> 17:05.957
Oops.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.392
Let's get him!

17:11.163 --> 17:12.697
Good afternoon,
I'm Tom Tucker.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.466
It's day five of the new
government-less Quahog,

17:15.468 --> 17:17.268
and I'm wearing
a T-shirt.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.303
Tom, I don't think
the government

17:19.305 --> 17:20.872
was requiring you
to wear a suit.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.341
Well, they were stopping me
from punching you in the face.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.509
Is that what you want?

17:24.511 --> 17:25.777
No, you know what?
You know what?

17:25.779 --> 17:27.111
Give me your wallet.
What?

17:27.113 --> 17:29.080
You heard me,
I said give me your wallet.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.682
This is a crappy wallet.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.851
You have bad stuff.

17:33.853 --> 17:34.852
Oh, what the hell?

17:34.854 --> 17:37.021
Lois, the TV
went off again.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.523
It's the
electricity, Peter.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.092
There are power lines down,
and there's no one to fix 'em.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.194
The cops don't come,
the toilets don't flush,

17:43.196 --> 17:45.797
and there's garbage
piling up in the streets.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.132
Ryan Phillippe's been
out there for days.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.468
Would anyone like
to be impregnated?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.036
We had a nice town, Peter.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.771
I had a nice life,

17:53.773 --> 17:57.642
but you and your antigovernment
buddies ruined it.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.844
Hey, so how's that
Tea Party going, huh?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.213
More like
T.P. Party.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.215
Toilet paper.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.616
I don't know
what happened, Brian.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.852
Not having a government
worked great in Somalia,

18:07.854 --> 18:09.887
but somehow we seem
to have botched it all up.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.289
Looks that way.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.825
Wait a minute. There might be
a way out of this.
What?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.593
We just talk to the guy
who got us into this.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.061
He'll know what to do.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.943
Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.546
But, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you got to do something.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.615
The potholes ain't
getting fixed no more.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.350
The stoplights ain't working.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.120
Tampon commercials
no longer use blue liquids

18:42.122 --> 18:43.688
in their demonstrations.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.790
(all groan)

18:45.792 --> 18:47.792
Make it blue.
That's always been the deal!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.261
You show whatever you want,
but you make it blue!

18:50.263 --> 18:51.529
Come on.
You got to help us out.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.763
Go to hell.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.031
I don't think he's going
to help, Peter.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.534
But if rich people aren't
looking out for us, who is?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.469
Well, maybe we need
to look out for each other.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.372
Come on, Brian.
It's time to make this right.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.942
Wait, before you go,
take two steps to the left.

19:04.944 --> 19:05.943
Look up.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.212
Okay, smile.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.814
Aw, I suck.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.183
(indistinct shouting)

19:18.790 --> 19:21.792
People of Quahog,
I have something to say.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.327
Now that we've
freed ourselves

19:23.329 --> 19:25.129
from the terrible
shackles of government,

19:25.131 --> 19:27.698
it's time to replace it
with something better.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.168
(all grumbling)

19:30.170 --> 19:32.770
The first thing we need
is a system of rules

19:32.772 --> 19:34.505
that everyone
must live by.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.174
(all grumbling)

19:36.176 --> 19:37.375
Got to have rules.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.510
And since we can't spend
all our time making rules,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.380
I think that we should elect
some people to represent us,

19:42.382 --> 19:45.383
and they should make rules
and choices on our behalf.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.651
(all murmuring in agreement)

19:46.653 --> 19:49.320
That's probably a good idea.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.989
Now, this may be kind of
expensive, so I got a plan:

19:51.991 --> 19:53.624
everyone should have
to give some money

19:53.626 --> 19:55.326
from their salaries
each year.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.161
Poor people will give
a little bit of money

19:57.163 --> 19:59.263
and rich people will give
a larger amount of money,

19:59.265 --> 20:01.766
and our representatives
will use all that money

20:01.768 --> 20:03.768
to hire some people
who will then provide us

20:03.770 --> 20:05.970
with social order
and basic services.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.538
(cheering and applause)

20:09.708 --> 20:13.010
Ugh, there's not one shirt
I wish I had out there.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.478
Now, it won't be perfect.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.148
Some of our representatives
may end up being bastards.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.016
But you know what?
That's okay

20:19.018 --> 20:20.551
'cause later we're going to have
more elections,

20:20.553 --> 20:23.154
and we can use those elections
to get rid of the bad guys

20:23.156 --> 20:24.522
and replace 'em with good guys,

20:24.524 --> 20:26.857
and then the system
will just keep going on and on

20:26.859 --> 20:27.959
just like that.

20:27.961 --> 20:28.993
(cheering and applause)

20:28.995 --> 20:30.127
So who's with me?

20:30.129 --> 20:32.997
(cheering)

20:32.999 --> 20:36.000
Will you join me
in trying this new crazy thing?

20:36.002 --> 20:38.069
(cheering)

20:39.771 --> 20:41.772
Then let's do it.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.642
(cheering)

20:44.644 --> 20:46.277
Yeah, and we did it all
without government.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.545
I'm very proud
of you, Peter.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.113
Oh, Lois, that means
nothing to me.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.449
I only care what they say on
the Internet message boards. Aw.
