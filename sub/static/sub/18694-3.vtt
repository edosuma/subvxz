00:41.886 --> 00:42.971
Evan!

00:43.037 --> 00:45.761
Come on. You're totally
breaking character!

00:45.814 --> 00:47.019
So what?

00:47.139 --> 00:49.432
You'd prefer I die from
an obstructed airflow?

00:49.557 --> 00:51.065
Just keep it cool, all right?

00:51.090 --> 00:52.987
Kyle, we're here
to conduct experiments.

00:53.042 --> 00:55.331
Cool is not exactly our milieu.

00:55.410 --> 00:56.433
Whatevs.

00:56.504 --> 00:57.886
Let's just get started, all right?

00:57.941 --> 01:00.105
Evan, open one of the
barrels. Be careful.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.128
This place is just
like they said it would be

01:02.153 --> 01:03.157
on the news.

01:03.182 --> 01:05.833
Check it out. The lid is ajar.

01:06.917 --> 01:10.355
Dudes... this is totally boss!

01:10.402 --> 01:11.996
Baking soda and acid.

01:12.021 --> 01:13.886
Instant volcano!

01:18.639 --> 01:20.897
What? What are you
two nerds laughing at?

01:20.967 --> 01:23.960
Because, zero charisma,
this isn't hydrochloric acid.

01:23.985 --> 01:25.428
It's sulfuric acid.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.411
Then what's the white stuff?

01:27.467 --> 01:29.491
C12 H22 O11.

01:29.516 --> 01:32.125
- Every kid's favorite.
- Sugar?

01:32.186 --> 01:33.624
What do you get combining sugar

01:33.679 --> 01:35.663
and sulfuric acid?

01:37.336 --> 01:39.637
Just wait and see.

01:49.249 --> 01:54.169
Only the biggest, baddest black
snake firework you ever saw.

01:59.242 --> 02:02.873
Aw, that was anticlimactic.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.919
Awesome.

02:17.231 --> 02:19.157
<i>Booth, please, I am not
trying to argue with you.</i>

02:19.182 --> 02:20.185
Okay, but then just say it.

02:20.232 --> 02:22.102
Okay, why don't you just say it?
Seventh graders playing

02:22.127 --> 02:24.849
with a barrel of acid
is not really the best idea.

02:24.874 --> 02:25.951
I will not say it,

02:25.982 --> 02:28.451
especially as they took
the proper safety precautions.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.537
I applaud their curious minds.

02:30.562 --> 02:31.629
Plus, their intervention

02:31.677 --> 02:33.422
did save the body from being
completely dissolved.

02:33.446 --> 02:34.427
- See?
- Zip it.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.966
Okay, Aubrey, whose side
are you on anyways?

02:35.990 --> 02:36.912
Hers.

02:36.951 --> 02:38.053
Sorry, but in this instance,

02:38.077 --> 02:39.412
I am hos before bros.

02:39.431 --> 02:40.998
- What?
- That did not come out right.

02:41.023 --> 02:41.865
No.

02:41.903 --> 02:43.849
Of course, the real criminals

02:43.914 --> 02:46.005
are goodlife chemicals.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.474
I mean, they are the ones

02:47.522 --> 02:50.130
who illegally disposed of
their toxic waste.

02:50.181 --> 02:53.285
Yeah, it's like love canal all over again.

02:53.310 --> 02:54.458
Stop with the love canal.

02:54.498 --> 02:55.880
What is with the breath

02:55.935 --> 02:57.412
coming through the back right now?

02:57.454 --> 02:58.537
It smells like death

02:58.576 --> 03:02.326
warmed over... almost like
a toxic blast of camel butt.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.568
Wow. This is a black Kale chia smoothie.

03:05.593 --> 03:06.664
Why? Why are you drinking that?

03:06.688 --> 03:07.897
Did you lose a bet or something?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.740
- Do you have an infected lesion?
- What?

03:09.765 --> 03:10.888
Why would you even ask that?

03:10.913 --> 03:13.847
Well, Black Kale is
high in vitamin k

03:13.860 --> 03:16.327
and antioxidants,
both of which promote healing.

03:16.352 --> 03:18.216
Okay. No. No lesions, okay?

03:18.247 --> 03:21.419
Jessica just thought maybe
it'd be a good idea if I, uh,

03:21.452 --> 03:23.279
went on a junk food cleanse.
No big deal.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.470
Go back to the doughnuts,

03:24.524 --> 03:27.107
because that smells like
monkey ass.

03:31.237 --> 03:33.434
(Indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:33.526 --> 03:35.622
Yeah, I see some over here.

03:41.926 --> 03:43.356
Easy.

03:44.488 --> 03:45.823
Wow, you were not kidding.

03:45.849 --> 03:47.996
This is like one of those
black snake fireworks.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.152
I told you!

03:49.184 --> 03:50.692
- All right.
- Science is cool!

03:50.737 --> 03:53.067
- Really?
- Wow. You've got to work on your delivery.

03:53.129 --> 03:56.270
- Uh...
- Excuse me, are you FBI?

03:56.317 --> 03:57.715
Because I must insist

03:57.740 --> 03:59.951
that you remove all these people
in Hazmat suits immediately.

03:59.975 --> 04:01.775
- Really, why?
- They're just doing their job.

04:01.873 --> 04:04.598
Their very presence is
prejudicial to my client.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.505
Oh, what a shocker.
We have a lawyer here.

04:07.573 --> 04:09.640
Who represents
goodlife chemicals.

04:09.669 --> 04:11.402
All these precautions... The Hazmat suits,

04:11.471 --> 04:13.160
the decontamination foam,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.379
it misrepresents that
these chemicals are hazardous.

04:15.404 --> 04:16.464
Nonsense.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.598
Sulfuric acid is not only hazardous,

04:18.644 --> 04:19.976
it is highly corrosive.

04:20.036 --> 04:22.096
It would eat through your flesh
in seconds.

04:22.145 --> 04:23.098
That is your opinion.

04:23.149 --> 04:24.645
Uh, no, it's fact.

04:24.692 --> 04:27.481
And the reason why I have
almost nothing to work with,

04:27.520 --> 04:28.824
except for this gray hair.

04:28.862 --> 04:30.620
So you're saying our victim
was an old guy.

04:30.692 --> 04:31.856
Well, judging by

04:31.973 --> 04:35.113
the deterioration
of the medial carpal joints,

04:35.199 --> 04:36.199
I'd say at least 70.

04:36.262 --> 04:37.496
Killing grandpa, huh?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.027
That's not good press for your company.

04:39.051 --> 04:40.114
You want to put that camera away?

04:40.138 --> 04:41.153
You know what I'm thinking?

04:41.177 --> 04:42.151
Maybe our victim here was

04:42.200 --> 04:44.270
one of the plaintiffs
suing goodlife chemical.

04:44.321 --> 04:45.666
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Bones, can you just tell me

04:45.690 --> 04:47.097
when the body was
dumped in the acid there.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.887
I can't saywith any accuracy,
but Hodgins would have a better idea.

04:49.912 --> 04:52.119
Oh, unfortunately, he
wasn't able to make it.

04:52.150 --> 04:53.588
He had some kind of
wheelchair accident.

04:53.612 --> 04:55.976
- So, do you have direct access to this site?
- I must warn you,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.601
if you even insinuate my
involvement in this man's death,

04:58.650 --> 04:59.902
I will sue you for slander.

04:59.978 --> 05:01.439
- Right.
- That's exciting.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.269
- Go ahead and try.
- Oh, no, it's the press.

05:03.362 --> 05:05.896
Could you people please hurry along?

05:05.964 --> 05:07.455
- Yeah.
- Oh, and did you get a sample

05:07.495 --> 05:09.643
of the sulfuric acid
for Dr. Hodgins to test?

05:09.682 --> 05:10.698
- Yes, I did.
- I said hurry! Let's go!

05:10.722 --> 05:13.657
Oh! Oh, the acid is all over me!

05:13.688 --> 05:15.336
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

05:15.407 --> 05:16.407
Calm down. Calm...

05:16.438 --> 05:17.633
- Calm down, calm down.
- Oh!

05:17.696 --> 05:18.657
You want me to calm down?!

05:18.711 --> 05:19.852
Calm down?! Are you insane?!

05:19.899 --> 05:21.133
- Whoa.
- Don't you know anything?!

05:21.157 --> 05:22.775
This stuff is pure toxic hell!

05:22.843 --> 05:24.657
Uh, do you want to be decontaminated?

05:24.710 --> 05:26.454
Do it! Wh-what are
you waiting for?!

05:26.501 --> 05:27.501
Wait.

05:27.549 --> 05:29.180
But, Booth, he's not...

05:29.251 --> 05:31.204
Not going to survive if we don't help.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.752
Isn't that right, guys?

05:32.821 --> 05:34.446
Hurry!

05:36.673 --> 05:37.727
Thank you so much.

05:37.758 --> 05:39.555
- Just doing our job, sir.
- Happy to help.

05:39.642 --> 05:41.180
Oh, God. Ah...

05:46.852 --> 05:49.238

06:20.477 --> 06:21.509
Hey.

06:21.543 --> 06:23.000
- Hey.
- There you are.

06:23.025 --> 06:23.975
We missed you
at the crime scene.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.446
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.524
- Is that the victim's skull?
- Yeah.

06:26.548 --> 06:28.038
Angela just finished scanning it

06:28.063 --> 06:29.492
so she could do
a facial reconstruction.

06:29.516 --> 06:30.898
What's all that
schmutz that's on it?

06:30.922 --> 06:32.486
It's carbon residue.

06:32.554 --> 06:33.555
Residue from what?

06:33.585 --> 06:34.765
Long story short,

06:34.821 --> 06:36.422
the victim was put in sulfuric acid,

06:36.454 --> 06:38.227
then kids decided to
do an experiment,

06:38.297 --> 06:40.366
- adding sugar.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.530
Creating an exothermic reaction?

06:42.555 --> 06:44.688
How long was the carbon snake?

06:44.743 --> 06:46.033
About 12 feet.

06:46.079 --> 06:47.367
Lucky son of a bitch.

06:47.436 --> 06:48.922
- Excuse me?
- Ha, oh, sorry.

06:48.977 --> 06:51.633
It's just, whenever I've thought
of my own death,

06:51.672 --> 06:54.250
that is exactly how
I've always wanted to go.

06:54.321 --> 06:57.336
Man, this day just keeps getting
better and better.

07:02.524 --> 07:04.305
Oh, hey, honey. I'm almost done.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.553
I just feel badly. It's not a very

07:06.622 --> 07:08.961
flattering portrait, I'm afraid.

07:09.024 --> 07:11.430
Yes, I agree.
The way you've drawn him,

07:11.500 --> 07:12.524
he reminds me

07:12.574 --> 07:15.289
of Eddie, the iron Maiden Mascot.

07:15.314 --> 07:16.727
Excuse me?

07:16.774 --> 07:18.274
Iron Maiden?

07:18.329 --> 07:21.954
Not the torture instrument
of historic myth,

07:21.985 --> 07:23.829
but the English Heavy Metal Band.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.319
You know who Iron Maiden is?

07:26.388 --> 07:27.641
You, who thinks

07:27.688 --> 07:30.089
maroon 5 is a color palette?

07:30.197 --> 07:34.368
Yes. I have long been fascinated with
black and heavy metal cultures,

07:34.429 --> 07:37.930
ever since we had the case
involving the band skalle.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.610
"Skalle," incidentally,
means "skull" in Norwegian.

07:41.647 --> 07:43.981
Yes, I-I remember that.

07:44.894 --> 07:46.266
Mm.

07:48.696 --> 07:50.320
Something's wrong.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.633
Angela, can you bring up
your photographs of the victim?

07:53.658 --> 07:55.211
Uh, yeah, just a second.

07:55.236 --> 07:58.024
The skull was still
pretty covered in carbon,

07:58.055 --> 08:00.079
but I don't think
I missed anything.

08:00.118 --> 08:02.618
And then go closer on the mandible.

08:02.937 --> 08:05.788
Oh, right, I see when I met...

08:05.813 --> 08:07.527
the weathering to the mandible.

08:07.595 --> 08:08.711
It suggests bite collapse.

08:08.743 --> 08:12.667
The disintegration of the jaw...
it is common

08:13.034 --> 08:15.101
among long-time denture wearers.

08:15.170 --> 08:17.136
Okay, well,
let's add some dentures.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.238
And his hair.

08:19.307 --> 08:20.473
Okay, I'll run a search

08:20.542 --> 08:22.540
through missing persons and dmv.

08:24.056 --> 08:25.712
I was glad to hear that

08:25.857 --> 08:29.737
Hodgins is doing better
after his wheelchair incident.

08:29.768 --> 08:31.268
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.714
That was, that was nothing.

08:32.739 --> 08:35.198
Just one of the wheels
popped right off the axle.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.587
Just one of those things.

08:36.611 --> 08:37.932
One of those things being

08:37.991 --> 08:40.033
you having sex in his wheelchair?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.292
What?

08:41.347 --> 08:43.150
How did you...

08:43.182 --> 08:44.612
Who are you?

08:44.645 --> 08:48.979
Just a forensic scientist at the
height of her deductive powers.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.823
I have to tell you,
it was really awesome.

08:51.854 --> 08:54.921
Like, better than it's been in forever.

08:54.953 --> 08:56.093
Glad to hear.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.523
And we also started
talking about

08:58.554 --> 09:00.289
maybe having another kid.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.718
Are you guys gonna have any more?

09:03.140 --> 09:04.968
We haven't had
those discussions.

09:05.021 --> 09:07.640
Perhaps... perhaps we should.

09:08.927 --> 09:11.382
Oh, okay, we got a match.

09:11.601 --> 09:13.093
James Felbeck,

09:13.128 --> 09:15.128
- age 86.
- Hmm.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.430
He had a long life.

09:17.499 --> 09:18.931
What's a silver alert?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.634
It's like an Amber alert
for missing seniors.

09:21.703 --> 09:23.035
It looks like this was

09:23.104 --> 09:24.704
issued this morning.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.025
He was last seen

09:26.056 --> 09:30.509
at the Retirement Center
where he lived.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.736
<i>Given his age at time
of death, it's surprising</i>

09:35.787 --> 09:40.205
how little the FBI has on file
concerning our victim.

09:40.255 --> 09:42.087
Which means he's probably
a pretty decent guy.

09:42.128 --> 09:43.642
No felonies. No misdemeanors.

09:43.725 --> 09:44.891
Also, no family.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.094
No children to visit him
in his old age.

09:49.541 --> 09:50.730
You okay, Bones?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.198
Uh, yes.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.500
Angela and I were talking.

09:54.569 --> 09:56.569
She and Hodgins are considering

09:56.638 --> 09:59.338
having another child,
and she asked about us.

09:59.407 --> 10:01.607
Wow. What, you want another one?

10:01.676 --> 10:03.426
Why? Our family's
perfect the way it is.

10:03.451 --> 10:05.591
- Oh, I completely agree.
- Right.

10:05.628 --> 10:07.911
Which is why I want you
to get a vasectomy.

10:07.936 --> 10:08.894
What?

10:08.919 --> 10:09.872
Vasectomy.

10:09.917 --> 10:12.770
It's a surgical procedure
where the <i> vas deferens</i>

10:12.809 --> 10:14.247
is severed and then tied.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.226
No. No, no, no, no.
No severing. No way.

10:16.724 --> 10:18.164
Booth, why are you
covering yourself?

10:18.193 --> 10:20.159
I'm not going to perform
the procedure myself,

10:20.228 --> 10:21.894
- in a car.
- All right. Ah, no, no.

10:21.963 --> 10:23.237
- Not gonna happen.
- Why not?

10:23.262 --> 10:24.308
- You scared?
- No.

10:24.339 --> 10:26.425
I am not scared, but, um...

10:26.503 --> 10:28.519
I'm a sniper, you hear me?

10:28.557 --> 10:30.657
And snipers... they
do not fire blanks.

10:30.805 --> 10:34.191
And in that analogy,
my ovaries are what?

10:34.330 --> 10:36.495
- Target practice?
- Tar... what? You know what?

10:36.552 --> 10:38.066
I-I don't want to talk about this.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.627
- Okay? We got a case.
- Let's focus.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.620
Okay, fine.

10:40.645 --> 10:41.778
Good. Thank you.

10:41.803 --> 10:42.836
You're welcome.
Okay.

10:42.861 --> 10:44.460
Just want to be
clear, all right?

10:44.485 --> 10:45.884
When we get there,
just follow my lead.

10:45.908 --> 10:48.642
My gut is telling me that our
killer is someone on the staff.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.925
Well, it's possible.

10:49.967 --> 10:51.861
The killer could also be
a fellow retiree.

10:51.909 --> 10:53.524
Come on. Seriously?

10:53.563 --> 10:55.165
You think that another senior

10:55.218 --> 10:56.851
killed and dumped our victim in acid?

10:56.883 --> 10:58.363
What? You're presuming
that just because

10:58.387 --> 11:00.950
somebody is old,
they are less capable?

11:00.984 --> 11:02.822
- That's ageism, Booth.
- Ageism?

11:02.847 --> 11:05.271
Now you're accusing me
of being ageist?

11:05.340 --> 11:08.474
Yes. However, if you'd like
to talk about something else,

11:08.543 --> 11:10.276
we could always return
to you being...

11:10.345 --> 11:11.629
No, no, no.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.144
How about those mets?

11:13.199 --> 11:14.738
What are the mets?

11:16.035 --> 11:17.283
Have to admit,

11:17.352 --> 11:19.051
this is a lot nicer than I expected.

11:19.076 --> 11:22.004
I agree. The facilities
seem well maintained,

11:22.076 --> 11:23.808
the residents engaged and active.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.892
Right.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:26.628 --> 11:27.746
Did you just, uh...

11:27.771 --> 11:30.777
- Pinch your cute little tuckus?
- Can you blame me?

11:30.802 --> 11:33.135
No, I cannot. I like her.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.378
All right, don't encourage her.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.446
Hello. So sorry about that.

11:35.470 --> 11:36.723
Agnes, hands to yourself.

11:36.748 --> 11:39.753
You must be Agent Booth
and Dr. Brennan.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.207
I'm Francis.
Very pleased to meet you.

11:42.347 --> 11:45.574
Not pleased,
because obviously death

11:45.605 --> 11:47.738
is horrible and especially

11:47.847 --> 11:50.167
when it happens in such a unexp...

11:50.214 --> 11:51.628
We-we-we get it, Francis.

11:51.653 --> 11:53.628
Okay? You seem a little
nervous. Are you okay?

11:53.704 --> 11:55.762
Given your occupation, I would
imagine you'd be accustomed

11:55.786 --> 11:58.505
to literally being
surrounded by death.

11:59.013 --> 12:00.096
What?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.518
- Death is inevitable.
- Bones, you don't...

12:01.542 --> 12:03.642
And in his case, relatively imminent.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.185
Stop. Sorry,
she didn't mean that.

12:05.216 --> 12:06.576
She just likes
to blurt things out.

12:06.607 --> 12:09.302
You're gonna have a very healthy
and happy life in front of you.

12:09.411 --> 12:10.692
- No, Booth, he will not.
- Stop.

12:10.717 --> 12:12.271
Can we continue this
somewhere else?

12:12.301 --> 12:13.701
An excellent idea.

12:13.726 --> 12:16.126
I could show you
to Mr. Felbeck's room.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.274
That would be best. You don't
just scream out like that.

12:18.298 --> 12:20.075
Well, you don't tiptoe
around death.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.081
- Right.
- It's part of life.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.716
Sulfuric acid
dissolved away most of

12:23.783 --> 12:25.153
the small Bones
in the extremities.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.578
Most of the Bones I have are cooked

12:26.603 --> 12:28.919
due to the reaction
of the acid and sugar mixing.

12:28.950 --> 12:30.575
Hey, no complaining
over there, pal.

12:30.614 --> 12:31.922
At least you got
something to work with.

12:31.946 --> 12:33.544
I'm not finding
any clothing whatsoever

12:33.583 --> 12:35.489
in our carbonaceous viper here.

12:35.518 --> 12:36.850
This is really
how you want to die?

12:36.874 --> 12:39.755
Yeah. My viking funeral, baby.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.167
I have to admit,

12:41.192 --> 12:43.111
it's a pretty amazing experiment
these kids did.

12:43.136 --> 12:45.558
Right? Michael Vincent and I
are totally recreating this

12:45.583 --> 12:47.380
when I get home,
only much, much bigger.

12:47.442 --> 12:48.808
Sounds like fun.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.974
You and your mini-me
playing mad scientist.

12:51.012 --> 12:54.099
Speaking of kids, you got
a wedding coming up pretty soon.

12:54.161 --> 12:55.903
A wedding is not kids, Dr. Hodgins.

12:55.974 --> 12:56.989
You know what they say.

12:57.014 --> 12:59.591
First comes love, then comes
marriage, then comes...

12:59.677 --> 13:01.208
Work, Dr. Hodgins.

13:01.271 --> 13:02.317
Work comes next.

13:02.342 --> 13:03.364
What have you gotten?

13:03.389 --> 13:06.247
Well, there's no flesh or clothing,

13:06.302 --> 13:08.911
but thanks to my esteemed
colleague, John George Haigh,

13:08.956 --> 13:11.323
I was able to estimate
how long our victim

13:11.364 --> 13:12.308
was in the acid.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.810
John George haigh?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.997
- You mean the acid bath murderer?
- Yeah.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.803
One and the same. So, George found

13:17.872 --> 13:20.567
that it took 48 hours
to fully dissolve a body

13:20.614 --> 13:22.974
to the point where you could
actually pour it down the drain

13:23.000 --> 13:24.864
- without clogging the pipes.
- Of course.

13:24.912 --> 13:26.731
When killing someone,
it's definitely plumbing

13:26.794 --> 13:27.913
that keeps you up at night.

13:27.982 --> 13:29.474
So, based on the victim's height

13:29.518 --> 13:31.364
and weight,
I was able to extrapolate

13:31.389 --> 13:32.788
that he was placed in the barrel

13:32.954 --> 13:35.075
somewhere between
18 and 24 hours

13:35.107 --> 13:37.747
prior to the sugar being added.
Unfortunately,

13:37.803 --> 13:39.857
all I found are some
blunt force trauma injuries

13:39.905 --> 13:41.567
on the left femur and left ribs,

13:41.614 --> 13:43.052
three through five. As you can see,

13:43.114 --> 13:44.669
based on the cross-sectional outline,

13:44.694 --> 13:47.180
the shape of the weapon
was long and cylindrical.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.838
Maybe a... pipe.

13:48.943 --> 13:50.742
Dowel rod?
Golf clubs.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.066
- Rebar.
- Baseball bat.

13:52.091 --> 13:53.958
- Nunchucks...
- Guys. Our victim

13:53.983 --> 13:55.162
was an old man in a nursing home.

13:55.186 --> 13:56.374
You might want to think, Cane.

13:56.398 --> 13:58.857
- Cane.
- Ah.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.415
Here we are.
This is Mr. Felbeck's suite.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.417
As you can see, we provide
very spacious accommodations

14:05.438 --> 14:06.586
for all of our residents...

14:06.625 --> 14:08.813
Uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?

14:08.890 --> 14:11.430
An A.L.S. I'm looking
for blood evidence.

14:11.524 --> 14:12.984
You didn't clean
anything up, did you,

14:13.008 --> 14:14.134
- Francis?
- I can assure you,

14:14.158 --> 14:16.118
the room is exactly
how Mr. Felbeck left it.

14:16.185 --> 14:17.063
Interesting.

14:17.088 --> 14:19.539
The decor is quite distinct.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.055
Most of these pieces
are French colonial.

14:22.125 --> 14:25.422
Yes. Um... Mr. Felbeck had a...

14:25.455 --> 14:27.306
- A fascinating life.
- Yeah.

14:27.331 --> 14:29.925
He told me he lived in Paris
for nearly 20 years.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.316
So, did Mr. Felbeck
ever complain

14:31.341 --> 14:34.618
about the staff members
treating him poorly?

14:34.946 --> 14:37.016
No. None at all.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.051
Um... he was very, very happy here.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.720
The staff adored him.

14:41.789 --> 14:43.255
How about any of
the other residents?

14:43.324 --> 14:44.635
Did they ever
complain about, uh...

14:44.659 --> 14:46.398
Staff members treating them poorly?

14:46.452 --> 14:47.822
Agent Booth,

14:47.847 --> 14:51.038
my residents are in
the twilight of their lives.

14:51.132 --> 14:53.599
So, they suffer from Dementia,

14:53.668 --> 14:55.034
Alzheimer's.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.694
When they get confused,
there are times

14:57.796 --> 15:00.439
when unfounded accusations
are made.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.763
Booth, I found something.

15:01.788 --> 15:03.255
She found something.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.376
Oh, my...

15:04.445 --> 15:05.845
Is this where he died?

15:05.913 --> 15:07.513
No, this is where
he went to heaven.

15:07.582 --> 15:11.150
My husband is euphemistically
referring to sex.

15:11.219 --> 15:13.319
By the sheer quantity...

15:13.387 --> 15:15.583
You're gonna need
a new cleaning service.

15:15.608 --> 15:16.952
So...

15:16.984 --> 15:18.773
Who was Mr. Felbeck seeing?

15:18.798 --> 15:21.165
By seeing, he means...

15:21.829 --> 15:23.662
In-intercourse.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.155
Yeah.

15:28.926 --> 15:31.413
That's her, right over there,

15:31.440 --> 15:33.774
in blue. Barbara Baker.

15:34.242 --> 15:35.841
Poor thing. She's
been through so much.

15:35.910 --> 15:37.343
What do you mean?

15:37.411 --> 15:40.505
- She has no family.
- Oh, wow.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.373
None at all. I mean, well,
technically, she has a daughter,

15:42.397 --> 15:44.429
but they haven't
spoken in years.

15:44.472 --> 15:46.361
Barbara doesn't even know
where her daughter lives.

15:46.385 --> 15:48.042
Look at her, Bones.

15:48.043 --> 15:50.460
She looks like my grandma Alice.

15:50.691 --> 15:52.057
Gram...

15:52.126 --> 15:53.459
Excuse me.

15:53.733 --> 15:55.427
Listen, let me just do
all the talking.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.107
I don't want you to excite them,
or say something

15:57.131 --> 15:58.679
that's gonna, like, freak 'em out.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.685
That's fine. I have no intention

16:00.710 --> 16:03.718
of causing this poor woman
a myocardial infarction.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.071
Hi, ladies.

16:05.273 --> 16:07.106
Uh, Barbara Baker,

16:07.175 --> 16:10.210
- can we speak to you for one moment?
- Oh, not now.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.341
I'm 84 and I'm playing Bridge.

16:13.366 --> 16:17.108
Whatever you need cannot be more
important than playing Bridge.

16:17.241 --> 16:20.022
It has to do with James Felbeck.

16:20.848 --> 16:24.343
If anyone looks at my hand, I'll know.

16:25.031 --> 16:26.968
Um... no...

16:28.702 --> 16:30.829
Tell me the truth.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.608
Is James okay?

16:32.686 --> 16:34.296
Maybe you'd like to sit down.

16:34.334 --> 16:35.921
Is he dead?

16:36.085 --> 16:37.303
Yes, ma'am.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.837
Murdered?

16:38.906 --> 16:40.452
Yes.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.142
Son of a bitch.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.515
Rufus Tucker!

16:46.540 --> 16:48.944
You bastard son of a bitch!

16:49.050 --> 16:50.842
What are you talking about?

16:50.913 --> 16:52.045
Stop that! What are you...?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.264
- Hey! Put down that Cane!
- Hey! Barbara!

16:54.373 --> 16:56.272
Calm down... Oof! Ooh!

16:56.309 --> 16:57.897
Hey! I said stop it!

16:57.952 --> 16:59.693
Booth, I would say we
have our next suspect,

16:59.717 --> 17:01.827
except I'm not sure
who seems more guilty.

17:01.936 --> 17:04.599
Mr. Tucker or the
Cane-wielder herself?

17:04.672 --> 17:06.538
Stop it!

17:06.563 --> 17:08.563
Is he going to be bruised?

17:08.633 --> 17:12.116
This is unacceptable. You must arrest him.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.365
He's a murderer.

17:14.596 --> 17:16.045
Do I look like a murderer?

17:16.084 --> 17:18.038
- Yes.
- Let's just remain calm,

17:18.146 --> 17:19.756
All right? Look, all I have to do

17:19.810 --> 17:21.474
is ask a few questions, that's all.

17:21.530 --> 17:23.374
You want to question us together?

17:23.452 --> 17:25.045
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Well,

17:25.069 --> 17:28.780
Columbo always questions
his suspects separately.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.045
That's very true.

17:30.107 --> 17:32.061
He would separate them by...
I'm... that was...

17:32.124 --> 17:33.928
The actor. Look. I'm not Columbo.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.499
My husband doesn't believe
you're true suspects.

17:37.780 --> 17:38.780
Yeah.

17:38.805 --> 17:40.499
- Because you're so old.
- Stop.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.452
Thanks, Bones. Really? I didn't...

17:42.539 --> 17:44.772
Barbara, let me ask you
a question, please, do...

17:44.797 --> 17:47.131
Why do you think, uh,
Rufus here is involved?

17:47.201 --> 17:48.592
'Cause he's jealous.

17:48.639 --> 17:49.936
Ah, ge...

17:49.992 --> 17:52.272
Jealous of your relationship
with Mr. Felbeck?

17:52.297 --> 17:53.874
You two previously dated?

17:53.923 --> 17:55.489
I courted Barbara.

17:55.514 --> 17:57.460
He asked if I wanted

17:57.485 --> 17:59.986
- to pork.
- I'm sorry?

18:00.335 --> 18:02.725
It's a line that's had
limited success.

18:02.788 --> 18:03.803
James,

18:03.850 --> 18:06.631
on the other hand, was a gentleman.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.458
He was kind and a good man.

18:09.483 --> 18:10.897
A surprise.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.163
Someone that I could see myself

18:13.188 --> 18:15.663
spending the rest of my days with.

18:16.858 --> 18:18.967
- Mr. Tucker.
- Hmm?

18:19.053 --> 18:20.967
Where were you
the night before last?

18:21.085 --> 18:23.286
Same as always, I was here,

18:23.311 --> 18:26.033
uh... watching TV until about 2:00.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.624
Can anyone corroborate your alibi?

18:28.654 --> 18:29.753
The new guy.

18:29.806 --> 18:31.108
Uh... what's his name?

18:31.148 --> 18:33.366
It's a color, uh...

18:33.460 --> 18:35.210
Blue? Yellow?

18:35.249 --> 18:36.916
Yeah. No. Uh, Blackie.

18:36.984 --> 18:38.514
Uh, well, black is not a color.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.342
It absorbs all colors on the spectrum...

18:40.394 --> 18:42.349
Uh, Red. He means Red Hudmore.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.397
He moved in last week.

18:44.466 --> 18:47.533
- Thank you.
- Go pork yourself.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.819
Cam, I was

18:53.844 --> 18:55.710
- just about to call you.
- I think...

18:55.758 --> 18:57.725
- I found cause of death.
- Excellent,

18:57.825 --> 18:59.788
but while it's just you and me,

18:59.813 --> 19:01.780
I was hoping that we might
be able to talk.

19:01.859 --> 19:03.259
Like <i> talk</i> talk.

19:03.284 --> 19:04.783
You mean about
what Dr. Hodgins and I

19:04.818 --> 19:05.967
- were discussing earlier.
- Look,

19:05.991 --> 19:08.952
I want nothing more than to
marry you, and I know how much

19:09.020 --> 19:11.162
- you want to be a father.
- Cam, can we talk about this later?

19:11.186 --> 19:12.235
Not really.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.359
Biologically speaking,

19:13.384 --> 19:14.803
our options begin to shrink

19:14.860 --> 19:16.259
in the not so distant future.

19:16.284 --> 19:17.577
I hear you,

19:17.632 --> 19:19.365
but when I look at you,

19:19.434 --> 19:22.600
all I see are limitless possibilities.

19:22.655 --> 19:24.436
That is the most beautiful thing

19:24.497 --> 19:26.697
I've ever awkwardly interrupted.

19:26.969 --> 19:29.061
Dr. Hodgins, what is it you need?

19:29.123 --> 19:31.733
Well, limitless possibilities
here sent me a text.

19:31.788 --> 19:34.190
You've got some vertebraes
you need me to swab?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.170
Yeah. Here, let me show you

19:35.195 --> 19:38.319
what I found, camouflaged
by the acid erosion.

19:38.366 --> 19:40.850
Extensive microfracturing
on the Posterior Arches

19:40.875 --> 19:42.811
of the C1 and C2 vertebrae.

19:42.836 --> 19:45.163
So cause of death
was likely a broken neck.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.749
All right, well, I'll swab
within the fractures for trace.

19:47.783 --> 19:49.667
Hopefully it'll point
to whoever did this,

19:49.692 --> 19:52.392
because at this stage,
it's anyone's ball game.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.057
Actually, I disagree.
I've been looking at

19:54.082 --> 19:55.461
the victim's medical charts.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.573
James Felbeck had Osteoporosis.

19:57.598 --> 20:00.288
- So his Bone Matrix was compromised.
- Well, yes and no.

20:00.343 --> 20:03.140
He was taking part in a drug
study to repair lost bone mass.

20:03.179 --> 20:06.765
And as of his last bone density
test, which was six months ago,

20:06.790 --> 20:09.013
his T-score was +1.

20:09.038 --> 20:10.890
+1? Doesn't sound too promising.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.835
Actually, it means his
Bones were as strong

20:12.874 --> 20:14.288
- as a 30-year-old's.
- And given

20:14.335 --> 20:16.163
the severity of the damage
we're seeing, I don't think

20:16.187 --> 20:18.249
there's any chance
one of the fellow residents

20:18.291 --> 20:19.757
could have done this to him.

20:25.293 --> 20:26.725
Excuse me.

20:26.796 --> 20:29.841
Excuse me, are you
Red Hudmore? I'm FBI,

20:29.866 --> 20:31.982
special Agent Seeley Booth;
This here is my partner

20:32.023 --> 20:33.576
- Dr. Temperance Brennan.
- You're here

20:33.601 --> 20:35.882
because of the guy
that was killed, right?

20:35.951 --> 20:37.450
Uh, did you know him?

20:37.519 --> 20:38.585
Uh, no. No.

20:38.610 --> 20:41.069
- What about Rufus Tucker?
- He said he saw you

20:41.132 --> 20:42.880
in the TV room the night before last.
Yeah,

20:42.904 --> 20:44.604
I was there till, uh...

20:44.760 --> 20:45.792
Uh, 10:00.

20:45.861 --> 20:47.960
He kept flipping the TV channels

20:48.015 --> 20:50.444
and talking
about his all-time favorite

20:50.523 --> 20:52.757
television babes.

20:52.812 --> 20:55.201
A gentleman...

20:55.270 --> 20:57.741
Would never talk that way

20:57.796 --> 21:00.341
about Donna Reed.

21:00.366 --> 21:01.484
Wait a second...

21:01.509 --> 21:04.451
You were with
the 720 MP Battalion?

21:04.476 --> 21:06.046
Don't tell me you heard of us.

21:06.114 --> 21:07.312
- I have not.
- Bones,

21:07.337 --> 21:09.523
The 720 was
the only Battle-Tested

21:09.577 --> 21:10.609
MP Battalion

21:10.640 --> 21:12.460
in Vietnam. My pops,
my grandfather,

21:12.485 --> 21:14.687
he served with them
back in the '50s.

21:14.718 --> 21:17.791
Soldiers of the Gauntlet.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.426
That's what they called us.

21:19.494 --> 21:20.905
That's right.
Soldiers of the Gauntlet.

21:20.929 --> 21:23.797
Right, well, Booth, now that
we've verified the alibi,

21:23.822 --> 21:25.542
we should get going.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.167
It was an honor to meet you, sir.

21:28.737 --> 21:29.936
Okay.

21:30.005 --> 21:31.417
Hey, Bones, hold...
One more thing, you know,

21:31.441 --> 21:34.241
you know, I may need
another set of eyes

21:34.265 --> 21:35.952
and ears on the property
while I'm gone,

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
in case you see anything.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.710
I don't know if you're up
for one last case?

21:42.851 --> 21:45.046
- Okay, Booth.
- Yeah.

21:47.210 --> 21:50.437
Hey. I got the swab results back
from the fractures

21:50.484 --> 21:51.896
of the victim's vertebrae and ribs.

21:51.921 --> 21:54.734
- So I was right?
- He was hit with a Cane?

21:54.780 --> 21:56.329
Yup. Aluminum alloy.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.164
Very lightweight and
extremely common.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.702
Also, um, I've got

21:59.749 --> 22:01.468
a requisition form here for you.

22:01.515 --> 22:03.843
- Oh. For what?
- Oh, you know, nothing much.

22:03.868 --> 22:06.069
Ballistic Gelatin,
Forensic-Grade Resin Bones,

22:06.274 --> 22:09.342
a dozen or so
aluminum alloy Canes.

22:09.411 --> 22:13.980
Also chinos, reading
glasses, and a cardigan.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.278
I don't want to know
what you're building, do I?

22:16.302 --> 22:18.835
No. You do not.

22:19.562 --> 22:21.654
Okay... do it.

22:21.723 --> 22:23.056
Hey, what about you?

22:23.125 --> 22:25.225
Is that the victim's hair I'm looking at?
No.

22:25.293 --> 22:27.234
It's Canine Dander
from five different breeds

22:27.296 --> 22:28.639
that was found at the crime scene.

22:28.663 --> 22:30.063
Take a look.

22:30.132 --> 22:32.198
Golden Retriever, Beagle,
Pomeranian...

22:32.267 --> 22:33.812
Yeah, they're all comfort dogs.

22:33.921 --> 22:35.194
The kind used in therapy.

22:35.226 --> 22:36.890
Also I found trace
of the victim's blood.

22:36.952 --> 22:39.194
Which means wherever they do
this type of therapy

22:39.253 --> 22:41.491
is most likely the room
in which he was killed.

22:41.516 --> 22:44.232
♪♪

22:44.257 --> 22:47.077
This is the common area,
where we do our Dog Therapy,

22:47.148 --> 22:48.515
among other activities.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.717
Who had access
to the room last night?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.720
All the staff and residents
have full access 24/7.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.955
This is Sam,
one of our orderlies.

22:56.024 --> 22:58.191
He'll clear the area
so you won't be disturbed.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.670
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have
to ask the two of you to leave.

23:00.694 --> 23:02.362
This is officially a crime scene now.

23:02.430 --> 23:03.538
- Of course.
- Yeah.

23:03.587 --> 23:05.321
Sam, if you will.

23:07.002 --> 23:09.235
Sam is tall.

23:09.632 --> 23:11.437
Tall.

23:11.687 --> 23:14.669
I don't know, Bones,
looks pretty clean to me.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.452
Nothing's disturbed, there's
no broken glass anywhere.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.305
You might want to check
the couches over there.

23:19.329 --> 23:21.289
My guess is that's where
they did the Dog Therapy.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.210
I don't need
your assistance, Booth.

23:23.265 --> 23:26.052
If you are bored
and need to keep busy,

23:26.077 --> 23:28.765
I have a video on my phone
showing exactly how

23:28.844 --> 23:31.577
a no-scalpel vasectomy
is performed.

23:31.609 --> 23:32.639
No, no, that's fine.
Look at that...

23:32.663 --> 23:34.023
Aubrey to the rescue. Perfect.

23:34.077 --> 23:35.569
Aubrey, what do you got?
Tell me something good.

23:35.593 --> 23:37.273
Well, I just ran
background checks

23:37.319 --> 23:39.116
on all the employees
at the retirement home.

23:39.155 --> 23:40.507
- Booth?
- Hold on. Yeah?

23:40.569 --> 23:41.935
I think I found something.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.970
- Please tell me it's blood this time.
- It is.

23:43.995 --> 23:46.163
However,
based on the smear pattern,

23:46.210 --> 23:50.015
it appears the killer used
multiple cleaning agents.

23:50.093 --> 23:51.110
Possibly as many as four.

23:51.171 --> 23:53.015
- Four cleaning agents?
- Wait, hold on.

23:53.085 --> 23:54.780
Did you just say something
about cleaning supplies?

23:54.804 --> 23:56.788
Because the guy that I found
is one of the orderlies.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.171
- Who?
- Uh, big guy.

23:58.196 --> 23:59.426
His name is Sam Wadkins.

23:59.451 --> 24:00.960
He got charged with assault.

24:01.015 --> 24:03.187
- Sam, six-foot-six?
- Yep.

24:03.257 --> 24:04.944
That's him, and by
the looks of the photos

24:04.999 --> 24:06.943
from the guy that he hit,

24:06.968 --> 24:08.905
seems more like
attempted murder to me.

24:08.944 --> 24:10.726
Okay, great. Thanks.
Listen, come on,

24:10.751 --> 24:11.615
- we got to get the orderly.
- What is it?

24:11.640 --> 24:13.905
We got to go find
the orderly, come on.

24:15.390 --> 24:17.170
Excuse me, Sam?

24:17.239 --> 24:18.972
Sam Wadkins?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.359
Yeah.

24:20.442 --> 24:22.491
We need to ask you
a few questions.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.148
- Booth?
- Yeah?

24:25.289 --> 24:27.656
There's blood on these supplies.

24:34.929 --> 24:36.703
Will you take a seat, please?

24:36.773 --> 24:38.632
I prefer to stand.

24:38.702 --> 24:40.969
Take a seat.

24:50.205 --> 24:51.695
It'll be okay.

24:51.796 --> 24:54.570
So, our lab found Mr. Felbeck's blood

24:54.656 --> 24:56.312
on one of the solvents
in your cart.

24:56.382 --> 24:58.132
If you want any leniency,
I'd suggest

24:58.179 --> 25:00.046
now would be a great
time to confess.

25:00.071 --> 25:01.303
No.

25:01.328 --> 25:02.570
I didn't do nothing.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.905
So, what, you're thinking that
someone went behind your back

25:04.929 --> 25:07.086
- and used your cleaning supplies?
- I don't know.

25:07.155 --> 25:10.148
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.600
Sam, why don't you tell me about
this man that you assaulted?

25:12.624 --> 25:15.128
That was an accident. He hit my car.

25:15.196 --> 25:18.909
- All I did was give him a push.
- Yeah?

25:18.956 --> 25:21.253
When you're six-six, 300 pounds,

25:21.331 --> 25:24.197
accidents can get
pretty messy, can't they?

25:24.222 --> 25:26.128
I didn't kill Mr. Felbeck.

25:26.167 --> 25:27.197
He and I were friends.

25:27.222 --> 25:28.845
We used to watch movies together,

25:28.870 --> 25:30.464
boxing matches.

25:30.518 --> 25:32.698
He used to tell me about
his time as a welterweight.

25:32.729 --> 25:34.901
He was one of the coolest
old dudes I ever met.

25:34.931 --> 25:37.439
Okay, then, so, as his friend,

25:37.495 --> 25:40.687
then tell me, if not you,
who else could have killed him?

25:40.755 --> 25:42.155
I don't know.

25:42.223 --> 25:45.158
So you didn't see or hear anything?

25:45.225 --> 25:46.722
All I know is, the last few weeks

25:46.776 --> 25:48.298
he spent a whole lot
of time at night

25:48.323 --> 25:49.886
- in the computer lab.
- Okay.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.659
And when I asked him what he
was doing on the computer,

25:51.683 --> 25:55.089
all he said was,
better I didn't know.

26:00.701 --> 26:02.101
<i>Hey, Hodgins,</i>

26:02.143 --> 26:03.738
cam asked that check
on how you're progressing

26:03.762 --> 26:06.698
on some sort of experiment.

26:06.761 --> 26:09.042
And now I understand why
she didn't come herself.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.698
Hey, Arastoo, come join us.

26:10.761 --> 26:14.042
Allow me to introduce you to
the newest member of our family.

26:14.136 --> 26:17.065
Preston Alexander Hildenbrand III.

26:17.128 --> 26:18.612
Or you can just call him gramps.

26:18.675 --> 26:21.433
Hodgins named him after
his maternal grandfather.

26:21.495 --> 26:23.940
Yeah. Now, grab a Cane

26:23.965 --> 26:24.901
and give him a good whack.

26:24.956 --> 26:27.433
What? No, I'm not hitting gramps.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.869
Oh, you'd do it if you
ever met him, trust me.

26:29.938 --> 26:32.909
He was the most selfish,
miserly billionaire

26:32.979 --> 26:35.198
son of a bitch this side
of Montgomery Burns.

26:35.276 --> 26:36.843
Honey, maybe
you should do it yourself.

26:36.911 --> 26:39.746
- You know, give him a good whack.
- Really?

26:39.814 --> 26:41.564
It's cheaper than therapy.

26:41.589 --> 26:43.720
Well, this is a long
time coming, old man.

26:43.745 --> 26:45.261
Okay.

26:45.292 --> 26:47.589
- This is very, very demented.
- Yeah.

26:47.623 --> 26:49.256
Ready?

26:50.825 --> 26:52.917
Ooh... ah!

26:53.558 --> 26:55.886
321 psi.

26:55.964 --> 26:57.276
That's a...
That's a good, strong blow.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.659
Yeah, it felt really, really good.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.067
The problem is the ribs
are barely fractured.

27:01.136 --> 27:03.034
Which means the killer is someone

27:03.128 --> 27:05.073
significantly stronger than Hodgins.

27:05.136 --> 27:07.448
Or our victim's Bones
weren't as robust

27:07.511 --> 27:09.776
as they were six months ago.

27:18.279 --> 27:20.453
I see you're, uh...

27:20.522 --> 27:23.186
You're taking some of our
computers out for evidence.

27:23.248 --> 27:25.129
Uh, well, apparently Mr. Felbeck spent

27:25.154 --> 27:26.659
a lot of time online before he died.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.029
I mean, could
be nothing, but hey,

27:29.054 --> 27:30.264
it's worth checking, right?

27:30.294 --> 27:32.889
I saw you also took Sam
in for questioning.

27:32.975 --> 27:34.608
You think he's good for it?

27:35.020 --> 27:36.857
I don't know the guy from Adam,

27:36.882 --> 27:40.951
but, uh, my gut says, uh...

27:40.959 --> 27:43.990
Not a snowball's chance in July.

27:44.865 --> 27:46.368
Tell you what, I got an idea.

27:46.404 --> 27:48.021
What do you say we go for a walk?

27:48.056 --> 27:50.334
- No, I... I don't feel like it.
- Come on.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.678
Come on, it's good exercise.
We can go scope out

27:52.732 --> 27:54.950
some suspects. Come on, let's
go for a walk. Well, I...

27:54.975 --> 27:55.771
Oh, ah, heck. Come on.

27:55.796 --> 27:57.185
Let me give you a hand.
Let me give you a hand.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.253
- You get that.
- All right, all right...

27:58.277 --> 27:59.787
Aah!

27:59.850 --> 28:01.553
Red! Red, Red, you okay?
Don't move.

28:01.578 --> 28:04.271
Hey, we need some help in here.
Red, Red, don't move.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.817
- Quick, call an Ambulance!
- What happened?

28:06.886 --> 28:08.619
We were just going
for a walk, and he fell.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.795
- You were exerting him, weren't you?
- No, I didn't.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.818
It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hudmore.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.660
I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

28:15.685 --> 28:17.568
We're gonna take care of you.

28:27.029 --> 28:29.263
Dr. Brennan,
here's my analysis

28:29.288 --> 28:31.318
of the calcium phosphate
leached from the Bones

28:31.444 --> 28:32.686
due to acidification.

28:32.741 --> 28:34.490
It's a substance called
"Bone Shadows."

28:34.529 --> 28:36.743
According to your measurements,
the victim only had

28:36.812 --> 28:39.357
20% of optimal bone density.

28:39.382 --> 28:40.865
Which means his Bones
were so brittle,

28:40.912 --> 28:42.748
anyone, young or old,
could have killed him.

28:42.834 --> 28:44.693
What's strange is that,
six months ago,

28:44.725 --> 28:46.451
his Bones were
robust and healthy.

28:46.482 --> 28:48.082
Yeah, the question now is,

28:48.107 --> 28:49.842
what caused them
to deteriorate so quickly?

28:49.889 --> 28:52.295
No, that answer is simple.

28:52.459 --> 28:54.232
He wasn't taking his medication.

28:54.287 --> 28:57.982
The real question is,
<i>why</i> wasn't he taking it?

28:58.068 --> 29:00.037
Angela, is this one of the computers

29:00.107 --> 29:01.982
- from the retirement home?
- Yeah.

29:02.014 --> 29:04.201
And you won't believe
what I'm finding.

29:04.232 --> 29:07.350
I assume you're referring
to pornographic material?

29:07.498 --> 29:09.974
Enough to make
a teenage boy blush.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.482
You'd think at a certain age
enough would be enough.

29:12.537 --> 29:13.998
Not for the male of the species.

29:14.023 --> 29:15.711
They are biologically programmed

29:15.756 --> 29:18.098
to keep wanting
sexual gratification.

29:18.123 --> 29:21.061
Which is why I told Booth
he needs to get a vasectomy.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.951
Can you see if anyone was
selling their medication online?

29:24.005 --> 29:26.107
- Wait,
- What?

29:26.162 --> 29:29.107
Prescription medication.
Specifically for Osteoporosis.

29:29.153 --> 29:32.505
No. The part about
you neutering your husband.

29:32.592 --> 29:34.076
It's a rational decision.

29:34.146 --> 29:36.467
Neither one of us wants
any more children.

29:36.553 --> 29:38.606
Right, but Booth is catholic.

29:38.631 --> 29:40.459
So? We had premarital sex.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.131
Clearly... exceptions can be made.

29:43.193 --> 29:46.232
Okay. You let me know
how that turns out.

29:46.287 --> 29:47.951
Regarding the prescription
medication,

29:48.021 --> 29:50.607
there is something
of interest I did find.

29:50.670 --> 29:52.553
See this account?

29:52.584 --> 29:53.615
Hattie Finnegan?

29:53.641 --> 29:55.201
I-I don't know who that is.

29:55.238 --> 29:58.373
Oh, she's a resident
who died a month ago.

29:58.494 --> 30:01.693
- Wait, this account is still active.
- Yeah.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.365
And someone has been using it

30:03.390 --> 30:05.678
to sell prescription
medication online.

30:05.765 --> 30:07.693
- Was it the victim?
- I don't know.

30:07.746 --> 30:09.374
But whoever they are,
they've been running

30:09.398 --> 30:12.119
some pretty questionable searches.

30:12.225 --> 30:14.904
I mean, anyone who
looks up naked pictures

30:14.929 --> 30:17.863
of Donna Reed... That's just wrong.

30:19.302 --> 30:21.839
- What, did I say something?
- Uh.

30:22.453 --> 30:24.453
I know we meet... for questionnair.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.443
Ah! Mr.Tucker, we did some digging

30:28.487 --> 30:29.798
on the computers
at the retirement home.

30:29.811 --> 30:31.592
We know that you were
selling James Felbeck's

30:31.634 --> 30:33.303
drug medication online.

30:33.434 --> 30:37.932
Good. That's excellent
detective work.

30:38.118 --> 30:41.003
I-I'm sorry, you-you're
glad we found you out?

30:41.028 --> 30:44.043
Well, my taxes pay for your salary.

30:44.104 --> 30:46.691
I'm glad to see that
they're not being wasted.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.026
Okay. So you want to know
what I think happened?

30:49.095 --> 30:51.120
Might as well. I'm paying for it.

30:51.145 --> 30:53.698
I think you stole his
medication to sell online,

30:53.723 --> 30:55.518
replaced it with
some kind of placebo.

30:55.543 --> 30:58.081
Felbeck found out
and he confronted you.

30:58.506 --> 31:00.682
I see.

31:00.751 --> 31:02.917
Uh, I take back what I said

31:02.962 --> 31:05.159
about the excellent detective work.

31:05.198 --> 31:06.497
Okay.

31:06.964 --> 31:08.479
Fine.

31:08.548 --> 31:10.190
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

31:10.215 --> 31:14.026
Well, James came to me,
said he needed money,

31:14.055 --> 31:15.721
asked me to sell his medication.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.846
Why you? Hmm? You two close?

31:17.871 --> 31:18.857
No.

31:18.882 --> 31:20.901
Barely knew each other.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.740
But he knew...

31:23.526 --> 31:26.197
I was street.

31:26.266 --> 31:28.132
You're street?

31:28.201 --> 31:29.229
Yeah.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.629
I'm very, very street.

31:32.531 --> 31:35.385
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I'm not buying it.

31:35.557 --> 31:37.057
Felbeck needed that medication.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.120
His Bones were turning
to dust without it.

31:39.145 --> 31:40.898
He told me he was overmedicated.

31:40.923 --> 31:43.891
Well, if he did, then he lied.

31:44.643 --> 31:46.651
All right, let's just
pretend for a second

31:46.676 --> 31:47.909
that I believe you.

31:47.934 --> 31:49.967
He tell you why
he needed that money?

31:50.024 --> 31:53.992
No. He said it was urgent.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.437
That's all I know.

31:56.787 --> 31:59.588
Promise.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.245
♪♪

32:02.307 --> 32:03.979
Thank you so much for coming in.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.003
And since you knew Mr. Felbeck the best,

32:06.028 --> 32:07.796
we thought we could ask you
some more questions.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.159
Oh, of course.

32:09.217 --> 32:11.128
Also, I just wanted you to know

32:11.220 --> 32:12.589
that your friend, Red,

32:12.630 --> 32:14.065
- is gonna be all right.
- Right.

32:14.090 --> 32:15.892
The doctors called us.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.549
He suffered a broken clavicle,

32:17.612 --> 32:19.635
but he'll make a full recovery.

32:19.706 --> 32:22.503
Were you aware of any
financial difficulties

32:22.557 --> 32:23.870
that Mr. Felbeck had?

32:23.940 --> 32:26.408
Oh, James never had a lot of money.

32:26.476 --> 32:28.948
But he wasn't
destitute or anything,

32:29.026 --> 32:31.012
I-I did help him out

32:31.081 --> 32:32.247
from time to time.

32:32.316 --> 32:34.299
Groceries and whatnot.

32:34.337 --> 32:35.830
Did he have any
outstanding debts?

32:35.893 --> 32:37.370
Well, what do you mean?

32:37.417 --> 32:39.087
Like to a bookie?

32:39.156 --> 32:42.018
No, James wasn't like that.

32:42.064 --> 32:43.142
We know he was selling

32:43.167 --> 32:45.260
his Osteoporosis medication,

32:45.299 --> 32:49.096
which suggests whatever
he needed the money for,

32:49.159 --> 32:50.846
had to be a matter
of life and death.

32:50.948 --> 32:52.901
Getting back to his past, I mean...

32:52.970 --> 32:55.753
- I understand that he was a boxer.
- He was a boxer?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.352
- When?
- That's a lifetime ago.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.198
He told me he started
boxing in his early 20s.

33:01.223 --> 33:02.260
Before the war.

33:02.330 --> 33:04.266
Wait, he said that
he served in the military?

33:04.299 --> 33:05.810
- Uh-huh.
- What is it, Bones?

33:05.835 --> 33:07.902
I need to get back to the lab.

33:08.771 --> 33:10.088
Thank you, Ms. Baker.

33:10.126 --> 33:13.362
You have been very, very helpful.

33:15.643 --> 33:18.126
Dr. Brennan, I ran all
the tests you requested.

33:18.186 --> 33:20.775
Did you examine the
victim's metacarpals?

33:20.815 --> 33:23.430
Yes, but because the Bones
were submerged in acid,

33:23.455 --> 33:25.088
all the remodeling
has been obscured.

33:25.119 --> 33:26.596
What about x-rays?

33:26.646 --> 33:28.513
They're right here.

33:30.823 --> 33:33.557
There are no calluses on
the victim's metacarpals.

33:33.596 --> 33:36.277
Which there most definitely
would be had he actually boxed.

33:36.362 --> 33:37.940
What about the metatarsals?

33:38.018 --> 33:40.057
Did you find any
remodeled march fractures?

33:40.135 --> 33:42.065
No, no stress fractures at all.

33:42.090 --> 33:44.955
Which is the most common
fracture found on soldiers.

33:44.987 --> 33:46.921
Here, let me show you
the isotopic analysis.

33:46.990 --> 33:49.510
Now, look at the
carbon, nitrogen,

33:49.565 --> 33:51.137
- and strontium levels present.
- I take it

33:51.161 --> 33:53.204
these do not match
someone who claimed

33:53.229 --> 33:55.229
to have lived in
France for over 20 years.

33:55.273 --> 33:56.539
Not even close.

33:56.607 --> 33:59.401
However, the levels
are a match for someone

33:59.446 --> 34:01.198
living in the
James river watershed.

34:01.223 --> 34:03.213
Most probably
Richmond, Virginia.

34:03.347 --> 34:04.721
So our victim lied.

34:04.789 --> 34:08.275
He lied about his vocation,
he lied about where he lived.

34:08.784 --> 34:10.918
He lied about everything.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.594
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.161
Cut it off, let's go. Shut it down.

34:18.186 --> 34:19.645
All right, listen, I tracked down

34:19.670 --> 34:21.431
where our victim lived
in Richmond, Virginia.

34:21.456 --> 34:24.143
Oh, so, uh, not Paris, France?

34:24.168 --> 34:26.275
No, he lied, but that was only
the tip of the iceberg.

34:26.299 --> 34:27.344
- Go on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

34:27.369 --> 34:28.900
- what are you doing?
- I was making a little

34:28.924 --> 34:30.431
adjustment to the recipe.

34:30.619 --> 34:31.696
What do you think?

34:31.721 --> 34:32.842
A little more, yeah?

34:32.909 --> 34:33.947
What about your diet?

34:33.973 --> 34:35.297
There are some

34:35.322 --> 34:38.618
sacrifices that a man just
should not have to make.

34:38.650 --> 34:40.188
Yeah, tell me about it.

34:40.214 --> 34:42.452
- So, what was the bigger lie?
- Get this, okay?

34:42.476 --> 34:44.217
The roommate in Richmond, Virginia?

34:44.304 --> 34:45.721
His name was Rufus Tucker.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.445
Oh, funny, Rufus didn't mention that.

34:47.481 --> 34:49.788
That's right, bring
him back in now, okay?

34:49.849 --> 34:51.447
Wow.

34:51.494 --> 34:52.835
Two detectives.

34:52.879 --> 34:55.612
Even more of my tax dollars
at work.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.320
- You lied to us.
- Uh, no.

34:58.402 --> 35:01.070
I...

35:01.101 --> 35:03.890
I may have made some omissions.

35:04.148 --> 35:06.475
Wait, wait, wait.

35:06.544 --> 35:08.413
You're-you're right.

35:08.468 --> 35:09.812
- I lied.
- Yeah.

35:09.837 --> 35:12.426
We know about you and the
victim, how the two of you

35:12.450 --> 35:14.171
used to live together. We also know

35:14.209 --> 35:15.945
that you were
accused of running a scam

35:16.036 --> 35:18.288
at your previous Retirement Home.
So, why don't you

35:18.324 --> 35:21.398
go ahead and tell us the
truth about why you were selling

35:21.492 --> 35:25.037
- his prescription medication?
- I told you the truth about that.

35:25.062 --> 35:26.701
Remember, I promised, huh?

35:26.726 --> 35:28.695
- One of those.
- Yeah, right, you ran a scam

35:28.720 --> 35:30.335
- on Barbara Baker, didn't you?
- Rich widow.

35:30.359 --> 35:32.398
No family except for
an estranged daughter.

35:32.452 --> 35:33.663
You hit on her first.

35:33.688 --> 35:35.609
You played the lech,
and then James swoops in

35:35.640 --> 35:36.656
like a knight in Shining Armor.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.273
You two were thick as thieves.

35:38.298 --> 35:40.116
You really expect us to believe

35:40.141 --> 35:41.335
that you didn't know
what he was gonna

35:41.359 --> 35:44.797
- spend that money on?
- I did not know.

35:45.057 --> 35:48.218
My assumption was
he was gonna buy a ring.

35:49.854 --> 35:51.023
I don't pretend

35:51.048 --> 35:54.249
to be perfect, huh?

35:54.759 --> 35:57.893
I've lied...

35:57.962 --> 36:00.679
I've-I've swindled.

36:00.747 --> 36:03.315
But there is one thing I am not.

36:03.634 --> 36:05.070
You're not a murderer.

36:05.095 --> 36:06.398
No, I'm not.

36:06.445 --> 36:08.078
What about Barbara Baker?

36:08.413 --> 36:10.573
You think there's a chance
she found out about you two?

36:10.610 --> 36:12.209
I don't know.

36:15.812 --> 36:18.984
You really think that I...

36:19.057 --> 36:20.477
Could've done something like this?

36:20.502 --> 36:23.374
Hey, unlike Booth, I am an
equal opportunity accuser.

36:23.421 --> 36:24.960
See, I don't care about sex, age,

36:24.999 --> 36:26.496
just motive and opportunity.

36:26.565 --> 36:27.931
Okay, well,

36:27.999 --> 36:30.099
looks like you might be right.
Check this out.

36:30.168 --> 36:32.374
- What is this?
- I finally figured out

36:32.424 --> 36:34.163
what our victim was doing online.

36:34.281 --> 36:37.343
This is a search for private
investigators in New York.

36:37.468 --> 36:38.843
That's where Barbara's from.

36:38.929 --> 36:41.304
It's also where she was living
when her husband died.

36:41.329 --> 36:42.109
So what?

36:42.134 --> 36:44.668
You think this could be like
a Black Widow Killer?

36:45.350 --> 36:46.816
I'm not saying anything yet.

36:46.885 --> 36:48.470
Can you send this to me?

36:48.524 --> 36:51.888
I need to figure out what
our victim was investigating.

36:51.957 --> 36:54.516
Dr. Vaziri, I believe I
have found something of note.

36:54.595 --> 36:58.313
Look at the distal
end of the left Ulna.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.610
Torsion spiral fracture.
I've already documented it.

37:00.706 --> 37:02.806
Likely caused by some type
of rotational force.

37:02.831 --> 37:03.774
I concur.

37:03.838 --> 37:07.126
Now take a look at
the anterior planes

37:07.165 --> 37:09.539
of the left Hamate and Capitate.

37:09.608 --> 37:12.313
It's faint because of
the acid degradation.

37:12.391 --> 37:14.944
But there are clearly microfractures.

37:15.259 --> 37:17.071
These suggest the victim
was holding something

37:17.102 --> 37:18.414
that reverberated in his hand.

37:18.483 --> 37:20.391
I need to talk to Angela.

37:20.462 --> 37:21.902
<i>Okay, let me get
this straight, you want me</i>

37:21.926 --> 37:25.243
to have our victim hit
the killer with his Cane

37:25.365 --> 37:28.079
and then compute the fractures
to the victim's own body?

37:28.118 --> 37:29.124
Yes.

37:29.149 --> 37:31.829
Because he wasn't taking his
medication at time of death,

37:31.859 --> 37:34.813
the victim's Bones were highly
susceptible to fracture.

37:34.838 --> 37:35.868
So brittle, in fact,

37:35.893 --> 37:37.403
they fractured when
he struck his killer.

37:37.427 --> 37:38.610
To sustain

37:38.653 --> 37:39.852
a torsion spiral fracture

37:39.920 --> 37:41.391
to his left Ulna,

37:41.437 --> 37:45.587
he must've swung his Cane
in a downward, diagonal angle.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.220
Okay, hold on.

37:47.278 --> 37:49.740
- This is just gonna take a second.
- Even in his

37:49.765 --> 37:52.481
compromised state,
the victim must've swung

37:52.517 --> 37:56.112
with considerable force
to fracture his own ulna.

37:56.137 --> 37:58.262
Which means the killer
was likely injured as well.

37:58.287 --> 37:59.879
Okay, guys, here we go,

37:59.918 --> 38:01.291
with the downward, diagonal

38:01.359 --> 38:02.592
angle swing.

38:06.589 --> 38:07.797
It's a match.

38:07.866 --> 38:10.081
So our killer was struck
on the left side of the skull.

38:10.106 --> 38:11.271
Have you met anyone

38:11.296 --> 38:12.429
with a head injury?

38:12.454 --> 38:14.021
No.

38:14.046 --> 38:16.246
But the downward strike
could've hit

38:16.281 --> 38:17.647
other parts of the body.

38:17.672 --> 38:19.372
Angela, run a new reenactment,

38:19.397 --> 38:22.167
this time hitting the clavicle.

38:26.217 --> 38:28.051
I think I know who did it.

38:34.899 --> 38:37.166
Hey, Red.

38:38.361 --> 38:40.428
Hey, Booth.

38:40.817 --> 38:42.650
What are you doing here?

38:45.070 --> 38:47.337
Look, red, I know what happened.

38:47.405 --> 38:48.897
I'm not sure what you mean.

38:48.898 --> 38:50.152
Look, Dr. Brennan took a look

38:50.177 --> 38:53.378
at your x-rays,

38:53.440 --> 38:56.446
and we know that you...
Fractured your left clavicle.

38:56.514 --> 38:57.526
Yeah.

38:57.561 --> 39:00.963
It was an impact fracture, they said.

39:01.211 --> 39:03.119
From me impacting the ground.

39:03.188 --> 39:04.721
Look, I was there, Red.

39:04.789 --> 39:07.690
I saw what happened,
you landed on your right side.

39:07.759 --> 39:09.289
All right?

39:09.357 --> 39:12.424
The fracture came when Felbeck
hit you with his Cane.

39:17.079 --> 39:19.148
You want to tell me
what happened?

39:20.508 --> 39:23.312
It was when he started
talking about the war.

39:23.373 --> 39:25.094
You caught him
in one of his lies.

39:25.164 --> 39:27.010
Yeah, he was bragging.

39:27.078 --> 39:31.609
Like he was some kind of war hero.

39:31.636 --> 39:35.104
He didn't even serve.

39:35.487 --> 39:37.587
No way.

39:40.164 --> 39:43.393
I didn't even hit him that hard.

40:07.753 --> 40:08.952
Hey.

40:09.014 --> 40:11.348
- You ready to go?
- Uh, yes.

40:11.589 --> 40:13.456
But first, we need to talk.

40:13.525 --> 40:15.734
- Cam, if this could just wait...
- No.

40:15.794 --> 40:18.000
It needs to be now, Arastoo.

40:20.109 --> 40:21.875
You know that I love you

40:21.938 --> 40:23.906
and I want to give you everything

40:23.935 --> 40:26.702
you've ever dreamed of.

40:26.771 --> 40:28.234
But getting pregnant right...

40:28.259 --> 40:29.875
I want to adopt.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.809
Adopt?

40:32.877 --> 40:33.898
No, you told me that...

40:33.961 --> 40:36.234
I told you I want to
be a father, and I do.

40:36.355 --> 40:38.164
More than anything.

40:38.217 --> 40:41.118
But recently...

40:41.202 --> 40:45.992
Cam, there are so many refugee
children out there in the world.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.609
And I just feel in my heart
that I would be a really...

40:48.711 --> 40:51.078
You would make such a good father.

40:52.049 --> 40:53.689
And I am with you.

40:53.714 --> 40:55.013
All the way.

41:07.336 --> 41:09.970
Booth, why are we
taking this way home?

41:10.336 --> 41:11.969
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

41:11.994 --> 41:14.127
Aubrey wanted us to
stop by the office.

41:14.319 --> 41:15.319
Why?

41:15.386 --> 41:16.853
He didn't say.

41:16.921 --> 41:19.039
He just said that it was important.

41:19.121 --> 41:20.654
I see.

41:21.518 --> 41:23.851
Bones...

41:23.887 --> 41:25.604
You know what we were
talking about earlier?

41:25.628 --> 41:28.461
Uh, about my, um... sniper?

41:28.486 --> 41:32.187
I shouldn't have asked,
given your religious leanings.

41:32.937 --> 41:35.601
Thank you, Bones,
that-that means a lot.

41:35.742 --> 41:37.445
Also, I'm...

41:37.470 --> 41:40.829
I'm not actually sure
I'm ready to-to close that door.

41:40.854 --> 41:43.250
- Oh, you want another one?
- No.

41:43.307 --> 41:46.351
I am completely content
the way things are.

41:46.517 --> 41:48.508
Okay, so what are you saying?

41:50.570 --> 41:53.343
You know, when I think
about what I value most...

41:53.388 --> 41:55.555
You, Christine,

41:55.580 --> 41:57.390
Hank, Parker,

41:57.472 --> 42:01.648
even my friendship with Angela,
none of it makes any sense.

42:01.703 --> 42:03.476
It was not planned.

42:03.547 --> 42:05.281
- So, you want me to get you pregnant?
- No!

42:05.346 --> 42:06.781
- I do not.
- Oh.

42:06.859 --> 42:09.289
We will be bagging your sniper

42:09.314 --> 42:11.265
and I will stay on the pill.

42:11.417 --> 42:15.787
I just... I'm... I'm not ready
to say this is it.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.429
What is it, Aubrey?

42:23.530 --> 42:25.508
Hey, uh, sorry to pull you guys in,

42:25.550 --> 42:28.484
but, uh, I thought
you'd want to see this.

42:30.418 --> 42:32.289
Why is Barbara Baker here?

42:32.333 --> 42:34.100
Who is that woman with her?

42:34.465 --> 42:36.047
That's her daughter, isn't it?

42:36.179 --> 42:39.359
Yeah, it turns out our victim
hired the private investigator

42:39.384 --> 42:40.390
to track her down.

42:40.459 --> 42:42.242
He paid the guy
with the money that he got

42:42.298 --> 42:44.099
- from selling his meds.
- I don't understand.

42:44.136 --> 42:46.054
- I thought he was scamming her.
- He was.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.030
But things changed.

42:53.336 --> 42:55.673
The unexpected happened.

42:56.351 --> 42:58.651
He fell in love.
