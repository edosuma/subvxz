WEBVTT

00:00.974 --> 00:03.238
Whatever it is you want, you have it.

00:05.945 --> 00:07.435
Get in!

00:09.649 --> 00:12.550
- You miss a couple of car payments?
- Don't get cute, Rod!

00:12.585 --> 00:14.746
- He is in trouble, isn't he?
- Sort of.

00:14.787 --> 00:17.813
It's like being pregnant,
either you are or you aren't.

00:17.857 --> 00:19.825
I don't guess you'd believe that's oregano.

00:19.859 --> 00:21.383
He doesn't like competition.

00:21.427 --> 00:25.761
Hey, don't look at me,
I just got hired to fly this clown around.

03:00.219 --> 03:02.483
I'll be damned.

03:03.923 --> 03:06.391
Hey, Moof, don't you know how to knock?

03:06.426 --> 03:09.987
Is that any way to treat a narcotics officer,
Rodney?

03:11.798 --> 03:16.201
- Donner, what the hell are you doing here?
- Checking up on one of my old busts.

03:16.235 --> 03:18.032
Hey, man,

03:18.071 --> 03:20.403
I'm so clean it smells good.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.068
That music will fry your brain, Rodney.

03:23.109 --> 03:24.770
Stunt your growth too.

03:24.811 --> 03:27.678
I'm gonna let you talk to my parole officer.

03:27.713 --> 03:31.877
She'll tell you I haven't even
smoked tobacco, so go ahead...

03:33.019 --> 03:34.680
You planted that.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.347
Yeah.

03:36.389 --> 03:38.755
But who is your parole officer gonna believe?

03:39.826 --> 03:41.487
<i>Officer Gordon</i>.

03:41.527 --> 03:43.188
<i>Hello?</i>

03:45.398 --> 03:47.525
What do you want?

03:50.570 --> 03:52.868
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

03:52.905 --> 03:55.533
Mr. Masters' tastes - literary and otherwise -

03:55.575 --> 03:58.635
run toward things
rather more substantial than.

03:58.678 --> 04:02.011
Milford's Encyclopedia
And Handy Home Reference Library.

04:02.048 --> 04:06.246
Sir, I've placed sets of Milford's
in some of the finest homes in the island.

04:06.285 --> 04:07.980
I'm sure.

04:08.020 --> 04:11.285
Precisely how did you acquire
Mr. Masters' name?

04:11.324 --> 04:13.224
Well, actually, I got your name.

04:13.259 --> 04:16.023
It was a chick, I know that.

04:16.062 --> 04:18.029
A chick?

04:18.064 --> 04:23.195
Well, not really a chick,
she was definitely past her prime.

04:23.236 --> 04:24.726
She had gray hair.

04:26.506 --> 04:29.839
- Agatha.
- That's it. Agatha. Agatha.

04:30.743 --> 04:32.335
- Agatha...
- Chumley?

04:32.378 --> 04:34.039
That's it. That's it.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.641
Agatha Chumley.
She said you two were extremely tight.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.174
Agatha said that?

04:40.219 --> 04:43.154
Zeus! Apollo! Stay!

04:43.923 --> 04:45.390
Stay.

04:45.424 --> 04:47.085
Sit, lads.

04:48.861 --> 04:51.523
Higgins, the lads have got to go!

04:51.564 --> 04:55.864
Why? Because they caught you pilfering
a bottle of Mr. Masters' special reserve?

04:55.902 --> 04:57.597
- Pilfering?
- What else do you call

04:57.637 --> 05:00.834
sneaking out of the wine cellar
with a bottle of '54 Duchamp?

05:00.873 --> 05:04.866
We used to call it living off the land
in Vietnam and Magnum was terrific at it.

05:05.912 --> 05:07.777
Rod?

05:07.813 --> 05:09.474
Hot Rod Chrysler?

05:09.515 --> 05:12.382
- * <i>O</i> nce upon a time... *
- I don't believe it.

05:12.418 --> 05:14.716
Me neither. What's it been? 15 years?

05:14.754 --> 05:18.417
- Rod and I were at the Academy together.
- How very... collegiate.

05:18.457 --> 05:19.947
And Nam.

05:19.992 --> 05:22.620
Yeah, that too. What are you doing here?

05:22.662 --> 05:24.994
- Selling encyclopedias.
- Encyclopedias?

05:25.031 --> 05:28.091
The thick books with the big words
and so very few pictures.

05:28.134 --> 05:30.398
- Cute, Higgins.
- I thought so.

05:30.436 --> 05:35.135
I'm sure you two have dozens of war stories
to tell each other, so don't let me detain you.

05:35.174 --> 05:37.404
Come on. We'll split a bottle.

05:37.443 --> 05:39.604
Not with a '54 Duchamp you won't.

05:39.645 --> 05:41.806
- You wouldn't consider...
- No.

05:41.847 --> 05:43.712
I didn't think so.

05:43.749 --> 05:47.412
Come on, Rod, I got a couple of beers
in the guesthouse.

05:48.921 --> 05:53.153
If you'll just think about it, I'll get you
a dynamite deal, best in the island.

05:53.192 --> 05:54.352
Mahalo.

05:57.296 --> 05:58.957
You look great.

05:58.998 --> 06:01.466
- So do you, Hot Rod.
- Forget Hot Rod.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.060
He and I parted company a long time ago.

06:04.103 --> 06:07.368
Mom still asks about you,
but after you left the Navy

06:07.406 --> 06:11.035
- you fell off the edge of the world.
- I had to go off and grow up.

06:12.078 --> 06:15.570
It was a long road,
a lot of twists and turn, turn, turn.

06:15.615 --> 06:17.173
Yeah. For all of us.

06:17.216 --> 06:19.844
It is cool, I don't regret a second of it.

06:20.853 --> 06:23.549
There are many that do,
however, including my ex.

06:23.589 --> 06:25.420
- You got married?
- It got me.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.119
Five years' worth.

06:27.159 --> 06:29.320
And a divorce that blew me away.

06:30.363 --> 06:34.697
I tell you, my ex has become totally radical but
it's all worth it.

06:34.734 --> 06:36.429
Dig...

06:37.403 --> 06:41.032
- Rodney Charles Chrysler Junior. Huh?
- Hey!

06:41.073 --> 06:43.701
- Lives with his mother in LA.
- A little Hot Rod.

06:43.743 --> 06:46.576
That's great.
Do you get to see him much?

06:46.612 --> 06:49.843
Every time I go back to the mainland.
I'm going there tonight.

06:49.882 --> 06:51.816
- You live here?
- For a year now.

06:51.851 --> 06:53.512
Ever since the divorce.

06:53.552 --> 06:55.315
I figured I needed a change,

06:55.354 --> 06:59.188
I found this sales gig with no time clock
staring down at me,

06:59.225 --> 07:02.126
and no desk to get locked behind
and fairly decent bread.

07:02.161 --> 07:04.959
- Sounds perfect.
- Speaking of bread...

07:06.832 --> 07:08.424
<i>O</i> h, what's this?

07:08.467 --> 07:11.197
Last time I saw you,
I hit you up for a couple of hundred

07:11.237 --> 07:14.934
and I swore that I'd send it to you
and I never did, which is typical.

07:14.974 --> 07:18.341
- Come on.
- I know what you're gonna say, but don't.

07:18.377 --> 07:21.244
Let me do this, <i>O</i> K? Please?

07:22.448 --> 07:25.611
It's for me as much as it is for you.
I'll postdate it Monday

07:25.651 --> 07:29.280
because I've got a commission check
that will come in and cover it.

07:29.322 --> 07:30.687
There you go.

07:31.557 --> 07:36.893
<i>O</i> h, I'm gonna have to pass on those beers.
I got to catch that flight to see Rodney.

07:36.929 --> 07:40.387
I got one of those low-cash flights -
no refund if I miss it.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.869
Plus I got a couple of deliveries
on opposite ends of the island.

07:43.903 --> 07:47.999
I know I shouldn't have kept selling,
but I figured one more commission check...

07:48.040 --> 07:50.907
The kid, he loves those pony rides
out in the valley.

07:50.943 --> 07:54.743
- I can make one of those deliveries for you.
- I can't let you do that for me.

07:54.780 --> 07:58.238
Well, I won't do it for you,
I'll do it for little Hot Rod.

07:58.284 --> 08:00.616
I always could count on you, Tom.

08:00.653 --> 08:01.984
Come on.

08:04.790 --> 08:07.987
<i>O</i> K, so let's see...
I'm gonna be back on Monday.

08:08.027 --> 08:11.793
I'll give you a ring,
we'll have a couple of beers,

08:11.831 --> 08:15.232
and then we'll just tell each other some lies

08:15.267 --> 08:18.703
about the good old times we used to have,
right?

08:18.738 --> 08:20.228
Right.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.571
Wrong.

08:24.477 --> 08:28.243
Man, I am running a business here,
cash and carry.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.683
Look, T.C., all you got to do
is keep that check till Monday.

08:32.717 --> 08:34.549
And then when Rod's clears,

08:34.587 --> 08:37.351
you cash mine and we're even, <i>O</i> K?

08:37.390 --> 08:40.722
I am not getting through to you, am I?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.318
Cash and carry.

08:42.361 --> 08:44.955
Your cash, my carry.

08:44.997 --> 08:47.693
No checks, no I.<i>O</i>.U.s.

08:47.733 --> 08:48.893
- Cash!
- But...

08:53.105 --> 08:54.595
<i>O</i> K.

08:55.674 --> 08:57.335
<i>O</i> K.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.037
I see your point.

08:59.078 --> 09:03.378
No sense in you going out of your way
to help a buddy of mine, right?

09:03.416 --> 09:06.510
It's not gonna work,
that is not gonna work.

09:06.552 --> 09:11.080
Remember that time in Nam, you and I
were in that funny little bar in Saigon,

09:11.123 --> 09:14.581
and those airborne guys
were gonna rip you into little pieces?

09:14.627 --> 09:17.357
I have heard all of this before.

09:17.396 --> 09:20.297
It's <i>O</i> K. Fine.

09:22.334 --> 09:24.859
It's heavy.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.035
You know, I remember...

09:30.075 --> 09:31.565
after the fight,

09:32.578 --> 09:35.240
I sold my camera, my only camera,

09:35.281 --> 09:39.718
to the guy who owned the bar
to pay for damages.

09:40.786 --> 09:42.219
50 bucks

09:42.254 --> 09:44.654
for a $500 camera.

09:45.891 --> 09:47.882
But it kept you out of the brig.

09:50.329 --> 09:52.024
You know...

09:53.032 --> 09:57.833
You got a great memory for remembering
things you want to remember.

09:57.870 --> 10:00.862
The only problem with that
is you keep forgetting things

10:00.906 --> 10:04.865
like gas bills, repair bills, bullet holes.

10:04.910 --> 10:06.741
Relax, T.C.

10:07.546 --> 10:09.605
All we're doing...

10:09.648 --> 10:11.912
is delivering a box of encyclopedias.

10:31.737 --> 10:34.331
Whoo!

10:34.373 --> 10:39.072
- You don't think that could be that guy?
- Definitely. That's the whirlybird express!

10:43.682 --> 10:47.675
- You sure this is the place?
- That's what Rod said.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.518
Somehow, those guys
don't look like the reading type.

10:50.556 --> 10:53.457
Maybe they just like the pictures.

11:15.381 --> 11:19.044
Hey, shave ice.
Finally a chance to relax after we work.

11:19.084 --> 11:20.745
- This your truck?
- Yeah. Mine.

11:20.786 --> 11:23.448
- You order some encyclopedias?
- Encyclopedias?

11:23.489 --> 11:28.119
- Yeah. From Rod Chrysler.
- <i>O</i> h, yeah. Encyclopedias, right. Got it.

11:28.160 --> 11:32.392
Hey, hang on, guys, I wanna check
we've got all the volumes here.

11:39.872 --> 11:41.075
T.C.

11:47.846 --> 11:50.007
<i>O</i> h, man, you have done it again.

11:53.252 --> 11:55.482
Hey, what kind of rip-off is this?

11:55.520 --> 11:58.580
We paid for ten keys,
there's only nine in there.

11:58.624 --> 12:00.114
Uh...

12:00.158 --> 12:01.989
- Damn.
- Hey, Dolphie.

12:03.061 --> 12:05.825
I'll deal with you in a minute.

12:08.901 --> 12:12.132
You know what?
<i>O</i> ur boss doesn't like competition.

12:12.170 --> 12:17.005
Well, hey, don't look at me,
I just got hired to fly this clown around.

12:17.042 --> 12:19.408
Then you know all his delivery routes?

12:21.179 --> 12:23.044
- Every drop.
- Hey, shut up!

12:23.081 --> 12:26.244
Don't tell me to shut up.
I won't get involved in no dealer war.

12:26.285 --> 12:28.446
Why you chicken-livered...

12:45.904 --> 12:47.235
You better come on.

13:29.614 --> 13:31.479
Home free.

13:38.256 --> 13:39.382
Almost.

13:46.531 --> 13:50.968
You guys were had. Royally, totally,
completely, to the max, had.

13:51.002 --> 13:54.460
Two of the straightest guys in the island
muling dope to an unknown.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.837
You never heard of a Rod Chrysler
as a dealer?

13:56.874 --> 14:01.004
Never. It's probably some hot dog
trying to make a couple of extra bucks.

14:01.045 --> 14:04.811
When the police get through with him,
I got a couple of extra bucks for him.

14:06.117 --> 14:09.314
Listen. <i>O</i> ne of the guys was named Dolphie.
Ever heard of him?

14:11.355 --> 14:15.018
- Dolphie. Dolphie Crenshaw?
- Well, I didn't ask his last name.

14:16.460 --> 14:20.328
It had to be Crenshaw. Man, you guys
are lucky you weren't iced permanently.

14:20.364 --> 14:23.390
Crenshaw works for the biggest
drug dealer on this island.

14:23.434 --> 14:27.393
If he thought you were trying to muscle in
on his territory, you'd be dead meat.

14:27.438 --> 14:29.429
Did you hear that? Dead meat?

14:29.473 --> 14:33.842
I mean, when they find out that
we're not dealers, they'll let us alone.

14:33.878 --> 14:36.779
Yeah, but what if that's not till after they've...

14:36.814 --> 14:41.410
Don't worry about it. I'll put the word out
that you guys were had, which you were.

14:41.452 --> 14:45.855
But your friend Rod's going to be fish food
unless the coppers get to him first.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.949
I didn't call the police.

14:47.992 --> 14:49.391
What?

14:49.427 --> 14:52.794
I wanted to hear Rod's side of the story before
I got him in trouble.

14:52.830 --> 14:55.560
Got him in trouble?
We're the ones getting shot at.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.967
We're the ones that Dolphin is looking for
for muscling in.

14:59.003 --> 15:01.597
- It's Dolphie.
- I don't care if it's Tuna.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.971
I'm calling 5-0.

15:04.008 --> 15:07.034
What's the matter?
You hate dope dealers as much as I do.

15:07.078 --> 15:10.275
- We don't know Rod's a dealer.
- You don't know it, but I do.

15:10.314 --> 15:14.011
- Just give me 24 hours to find him.
- If Dolphie lets him live that long.

15:14.051 --> 15:18.249
He made it through Nam,
he'll make it through the next 24 hours.

15:23.628 --> 15:25.255
You owe this guy, huh?

15:27.164 --> 15:31.066
When Ivan was holding you and I
in Duc Hue...

15:32.103 --> 15:35.072
Rod was Stateside,
he found out I was an MIA, he...

15:36.540 --> 15:39.338
took a 30-day leave
and he spent it with my mom.

15:55.927 --> 16:02.196
If this is another attempt to pilfer a bottle
from the wine cellar, Magnum, it won't work.

16:02.233 --> 16:06.693
Higgins,
I was just walking in to ask you a question.

16:06.737 --> 16:08.261
<i>O</i> n your toes?

16:08.306 --> 16:10.206
I was not on my toes!

16:10.241 --> 16:12.436
I can't help it if I walk softly.

16:12.476 --> 16:15.604
What do you want me to do?
Wear a silver bell round my neck?

16:15.646 --> 16:18.877
In your case, I think brass would suffice.

16:24.221 --> 16:25.950
Is that real?

16:26.991 --> 16:28.481
<i>O</i> f course it's real.

16:28.526 --> 16:32.121
It was entrusted to me by
the Baron von Brandenburg for safekeeping.

16:32.163 --> 16:33.824
What, the old guy?

16:33.864 --> 16:39.461
Who wears the walrus moustache and
chases the maids around while he's here?

16:39.503 --> 16:41.664
I believe the baron has a moustache, yes.

16:41.706 --> 16:42.832
He's back?

16:42.873 --> 16:46.969
- With his bride, Elizabeth Quill.
- I know that name.

16:47.011 --> 16:48.911
In the modeling world,

16:48.946 --> 16:50.811
she was known as Miss El.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.577
He married Miss El?

16:54.719 --> 16:56.209
- And they're here?
- Yes.

16:56.253 --> 16:59.689
Although I haven't seen them
since dinner last night.

16:59.724 --> 17:03.785
It's almost six. What do you suppose
they could be doing all this time?

17:07.330 --> 17:08.992
What is it you want, Magnum?

17:09.967 --> 17:12.333
What is it you want?

17:12.369 --> 17:15.031
Uh, Rod Chrysler's phone number.

17:15.740 --> 17:18.265
Rod Chrysler? The encyclopedia salesman?

17:19.276 --> 17:21.403
I thought he was a chum of yours.

17:21.444 --> 17:25.211
He forgot to give me his number,
but he gave you his card.

17:26.983 --> 17:30.647
I hope this doesn't mean an endless summer
of his presence on the estate.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.588
I just want to get in touch with him.

17:32.623 --> 17:36.855
He didn't strike me as the trustworthy type,
if you know what I mean.

17:36.894 --> 17:39.124
- No, you wouldn't.
- The card.

17:42.266 --> 17:45.997
<i>Rod wasn't the same guy
I'd known in the academy, or in Nam.</i>

17:46.037 --> 17:47.698
<i>But then neither was I</i>.

17:48.572 --> 17:52.303
<i>But no matter what he'd become,
I didn't want to believe it was a dealer.</i>

17:52.343 --> 17:56.279
<i>I couldn't believe it,
not after what he'd done for my mom.</i>

18:00.251 --> 18:02.776
Interviews aren't till one o'clock.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.950
<i>O</i> h, uh, I'm not looking for a job,
I'd like to speak to one of your salesmen.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.093
<i>O</i> h, be right there.

18:19.904 --> 18:21.769
Herm Dunbar, Sales Manager.

18:21.806 --> 18:24.673
Normally we keep the door locked
during the lunch hour.

18:24.708 --> 18:28.644
- We don't have much walk-in trade. Mr...
- Magnum.

18:28.679 --> 18:31.170
Mr. Magnum,
you know you are one in a thousand.

18:31.215 --> 18:35.618
That's what our sales research people say,
one in a thousand, but there is no problem.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.450
No problem at all. Here it is.

18:37.488 --> 18:42.551
The top-of-the-line, the Milford Milestone
Edition, bound in Moroccan leather with...

18:42.593 --> 18:45.687
- Mr. Dunbar.
- Herm.

18:47.131 --> 18:49.065
I'm here to see Rod Chrysler.

18:49.100 --> 18:53.503
Rod... <i>O</i> ne of the very best,
I taught him the business myself.

18:53.537 --> 18:55.903
But he's not here and I thought that I could...

18:55.940 --> 18:58.773
I'd feel better if I spoke to him,
you understand?

18:58.809 --> 19:02.267
I do, I understand, but I mean he's not here.

19:03.414 --> 19:05.348
Did he fly to LA to see his kid?

19:06.884 --> 19:09.546
I don't know anything about any kid.

19:10.521 --> 19:12.785
- Can you give me his address?
- No.

19:12.823 --> 19:17.556
I don't have it. He comes in here, places
his orders, picks up his commission checks.

19:17.595 --> 19:24.228
I've got to be perfectly honest with you.
I've had a few problems with Chrysler.

19:24.268 --> 19:27.362
He's a little bit of a flake,
if you know what I mean.

19:27.404 --> 19:30.339
Don't misunderstand me,
I love him, he's like my own kid.

19:30.374 --> 19:33.571
<i>O</i> therwise, why would I give him a job,
him being on probation?

19:33.611 --> 19:35.272
- Probation?
- Mm-hm.

19:35.312 --> 19:37.507
- For what?
- Growing dope.

19:39.483 --> 19:44.614
Now, Mr. Magnum, we have this weekend
an offer that only I am...

19:44.655 --> 19:46.384
Thanks.

19:47.858 --> 19:50.691
<i>I know, it was time to call 5-0
and fill them in.</i>

19:50.728 --> 19:54.391
<i>I mean, how much proof did I need
that Rod was dealing?</i>

19:54.431 --> 19:57.457
<i>I guess a little more, because I didn't call 5-0</i>.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.594
<i>I went to the authorities, though</i>.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.298
<i>Well, sort of</i>.

20:12.416 --> 20:14.441
- Miss Gordon?
- <i>O</i> fficer Gordon.

20:14.485 --> 20:16.248
Have a seat, I'll just be a second.

20:23.294 --> 20:24.886
Never ceases to amaze me.

20:25.663 --> 20:28.496
Just because I'm a woman
and relatively attractive,

20:28.532 --> 20:34.402
my parolees seem to think they can break
rules without paying the piper, Mr. Peters.

20:34.438 --> 20:36.668
No, look, there's been a mistake.

20:36.707 --> 20:38.971
We'd better get something straight.

20:39.009 --> 20:42.445
You can tell your mother, sister,
girlfriend or wife

20:42.479 --> 20:45.471
anything you want to
about how you were framed on your...

20:45.516 --> 20:47.916
- bunko charge.
- No. Wait a minute.

20:47.952 --> 20:52.582
- You don't understand.
- Taking insurance money from old ladies.

20:52.623 --> 20:55.183
No. My name's Magnum.

20:56.193 --> 21:00.357
- Why isn't it listed here as an alias?
- It's Thomas Magnum.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.892
I'm a private investigator.

21:04.602 --> 21:06.229
See?

21:09.907 --> 21:12.307
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

21:12.343 --> 21:16.040
- What can I do for you?
- I need information on one of your parolees.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.809
- Which one?
- Rod Chrysler.

21:17.848 --> 21:21.409
- Is he in trouble?
- No, we're just buddies.

21:21.452 --> 21:23.613
We served in Nam and I heard he was here.

21:23.654 --> 21:26.487
- He is in trouble, isn't he?
- No.

21:26.523 --> 21:31.392
Look, I can smell a lie before you can say it,
I have to in this line of work.

21:31.428 --> 21:33.726
Well, let's just say maybe.

21:34.732 --> 21:39.897
<i>O</i> K. You give me his address, I'll come back
here with him, we'll explain the whole thing.

21:39.937 --> 21:42.064
How close are you two?

21:44.041 --> 21:49.343
Well, he did something for me once,
it was a nice thing, kind thing, and...

21:49.380 --> 21:51.041
I figure I owe him one.

21:51.081 --> 21:52.742
I know what you mean.

21:52.783 --> 21:56.310
Look, I don't trust Rod
as far as I can see him, but...

21:56.353 --> 21:58.651
when my mom was in the hospital,

21:58.689 --> 22:01.157
he went to visit her every single day.

22:01.191 --> 22:03.751
He told her he was one of my co-workers.

22:04.862 --> 22:07.092
Nice thing to do for a scared old lady.

22:08.799 --> 22:11.290
- Mm.
- Look.

22:11.335 --> 22:16.637
I'm not gonna give you his address,
but I will tell you where he's working today.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.010
Whatever it is, I want to know.

22:21.045 --> 22:22.706
Well, you have my word.

22:24.548 --> 22:27.210
Look, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

22:27.251 --> 22:30.618
- But you do look like the bunko type.
- Thanks.

22:30.654 --> 22:33.350
I'm sorry I'm late for my appointment.

22:34.258 --> 22:35.782
I'm Peters.

22:35.826 --> 22:37.851
Have a seat, Mr. Peters.

23:24.141 --> 23:28.601
- Why are you running from me, Rod?
- I'm not, I'm running from them!

23:32.281 --> 23:33.937
Get in!

24:07.483 --> 24:11.544
Get down! We haven't done anything
like that since we took my '55 Chevy

24:11.587 --> 24:15.353
down to St Michael's
right before our midshipmen's cruise.

24:17.226 --> 24:20.354
- You know who those guys were, Rod?
- Muggers?

24:20.396 --> 24:24.799
So to speak. They're muscle
for the biggest dealer in the island.

24:24.833 --> 24:27.825
- You miss a couple of car payments?
- Don't get cute, Rod!

24:27.870 --> 24:29.531
No, sir.

24:31.006 --> 24:35.773
You see, they think I'm a dope dealer
trying to muscle in on their territory.

24:35.811 --> 24:37.779
Why would they think that, Rod?

24:37.813 --> 24:40.941
- I got an idea.
- And I want to hear all about it.

24:43.752 --> 24:48.883
I know it sounds like an excuse,
but Cindy was really growing the stuff.

24:49.925 --> 24:51.586
Cindy's my ex.

24:52.594 --> 24:54.858
We were pretty broke at the time,

24:54.897 --> 24:57.991
up in Big Sur,
and everybody was cultivating a little bit.

24:58.033 --> 24:59.364
Not everybody.

25:00.436 --> 25:02.267
Everybody who lived there.

25:03.038 --> 25:06.974
Anyway, the narcs decided to clean it up,
so we got busted.

25:07.009 --> 25:10.001
I couldn't see her going down,
she being pregnant.

25:10.045 --> 25:13.947
- So I said it was my patch and took the fall.
- How gallant.

25:13.983 --> 25:17.544
She divorced me while I was doing time
in Camarillo.

25:17.586 --> 25:19.679
After you took the rap?

25:19.722 --> 25:21.383
It was 18 months.

25:22.491 --> 25:25.460
She had little Rodney, you know.

25:25.494 --> 25:27.086
She got lonely.

25:27.129 --> 25:31.691
She met some... country singer
from Bakersfield and...

25:32.968 --> 25:35.232
It happens.

25:36.605 --> 25:39.540
So you moved to <i>O</i> ahu
and started your own patch here.

25:39.575 --> 25:43.375
No, I swear to you I didn't do that.
I was super cool when I got here.

25:43.412 --> 25:45.380
I had to be, I was still on summary.

25:45.414 --> 25:49.783
Then how did a case of encyclopedias
turn into nine bricks of marijuana?

25:49.818 --> 25:54.380
Donner. The narc who busted me
in Big Sur. He shows up here a week ago.

25:54.423 --> 25:59.190
He walks into my house, plants drugs on me
and tells me I got to make a drop for him,

25:59.228 --> 26:02.493
- or I'm back in Camarillo.
- Why didn't you call the police?

26:03.665 --> 26:05.997
What am I gonna say to the police?

26:06.035 --> 26:10.096
It's a narc's word against mine.
Who are they gonna believe?

26:11.573 --> 26:15.703
So you just decided to drop
your load of troubles onto me, huh?

26:15.744 --> 26:17.405
I'm sorry about that.

26:17.446 --> 26:19.414
I was scared, man.

26:19.448 --> 26:23.111
I didn't know if this was for real
or if he was trying to set me up for a bust.

26:23.152 --> 26:25.245
So if anyone gets busted, let it be me?

26:25.287 --> 26:29.348
Hey, I read in the paper where you're involved
in some kind of aerial coke bust,

26:29.391 --> 26:32.451
so I figured you'd flash your ID
and then escape.

26:34.830 --> 26:36.263
It's kinda dumb, huh?

26:36.298 --> 26:38.266
Not kinda, Rod.

26:51.447 --> 26:52.744
<i>O</i> K.

26:54.650 --> 26:58.609
I can understand you not going to 5-0,
but why didn't you tell <i>O</i> fficer Gordon?

26:58.654 --> 27:00.315
<i>O</i> h, no.

27:00.355 --> 27:02.516
You didn't go to Gordon, did you, Magnum?

27:03.559 --> 27:06.585
- Get in, Rod.
- She's a great-looking chick.

27:06.628 --> 27:09.893
But on top of those long legs
is the brains of a barracuda.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.924
If you said anything to her,
then I'm back in Camarillo.

27:12.968 --> 27:14.629
Get in, Rod.

27:19.842 --> 27:24.108
Where we going? Thomas? Buddy?

27:26.949 --> 27:30.476
Coming back won't do you any good.
Rules are rules, Peters.

27:30.519 --> 27:31.986
It's Magnum.

27:34.490 --> 27:37.015
<i>O</i> h. I did it again, didn't I?

27:38.227 --> 27:40.286
Well, Peters and I sort of look alike.

27:40.329 --> 27:41.990
I take it you found Rod?

27:43.398 --> 27:45.059
And he's in trouble?

27:45.100 --> 27:46.465
Sort of.

27:46.502 --> 27:50.199
Being in trouble's like being pregnant,
either you are or you aren't.

27:50.239 --> 27:53.208
Well, he is, but I don't think it's his fault.

27:53.242 --> 27:56.302
- They say the same about being pregnant.
- No, see...

27:57.312 --> 28:00.509
I think it's just possible
that Rod's been set up.

28:00.549 --> 28:02.449
He tells a pretty convincing story.

28:03.519 --> 28:05.009
Don't they all?

28:05.053 --> 28:08.682
- Where is he?
- Rod.

28:11.426 --> 28:14.224
Hi, Miss Gordon. How's your mom?

28:51.233 --> 28:52.894
Hi, guys.

28:54.803 --> 28:58.330
<i>O</i> h... I was just making change.

28:58.373 --> 29:00.034
See, it's...

29:00.075 --> 29:05.240
It says it's 35 cents and I put in two quarters,
and I was just looking for 15 cents.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.214
See, that would make it even.

29:08.350 --> 29:11.342
But what the heck? What's 15 cents, huh?

29:11.386 --> 29:16.016
As a matter of fact, why don't I buy you
a cup of coffee? You want some coffee?

29:19.428 --> 29:21.658
I don't suppose you have any change,
do you?

29:22.698 --> 29:24.359
Right.

29:26.401 --> 29:28.062
Got it.

29:29.504 --> 29:31.165
Right. <i>O</i> K.

29:31.807 --> 29:33.707
Thanks, Jim. I will.

29:35.577 --> 29:38.205
<i>O</i> fficer Donner is on vacation in Hawaii.

29:38.247 --> 29:39.737
Didn't I tell you?

29:39.781 --> 29:43.410
And the number you gave me
is the same one he left with his office.

29:43.452 --> 29:45.079
You were telling the truth.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.283
You shouldn't have doubted me, Thomas.

29:48.323 --> 29:49.984
Who are you calling?

29:50.025 --> 29:53.256
- 5-0, Narcotics.
- No, no. You can't do that.

29:53.295 --> 29:56.458
Why not, Rod?
Is there something you haven't told us?

29:56.498 --> 29:59.296
- It will be my word against a narc.
- He's right.

29:59.334 --> 30:02.303
Donner will just deny it.
And who'd believe Rod?

30:02.337 --> 30:05.272
Who'd believe me? Except my pals.

30:07.209 --> 30:10.645
I don't have a choice.
I have to involve Narcotics.

30:10.679 --> 30:12.340
What did I tell you?

30:12.381 --> 30:14.042
Barracuda.

30:17.953 --> 30:22.720
You could call 5-0 after we catch Donner.
With the dope.

30:22.758 --> 30:24.589
And how are we gonna do that?

30:24.626 --> 30:27.186
- We just set up a sale through Rod.
- Me?

30:27.229 --> 30:31.632
Yeah. You've got nothing to fear, Rod,
as long as you're telling the truth.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.658
I am, I swear.

30:34.970 --> 30:37.461
<i>O</i> h, Mr. Peters.

30:38.106 --> 30:39.835
I mean Magnum.

30:40.876 --> 30:43.743
This whole thing is out of my jurisdiction.

30:43.779 --> 30:45.440
I know.

30:45.480 --> 30:49.314
I just thought your job
was taking care of people like Rod,

30:49.351 --> 30:53.754
seeing to it that they had a chance
to get their lives back on track,

30:53.789 --> 30:57.953
to get an opportunity to atone
for the mistakes of their past,

30:57.993 --> 31:02.123
to contribute to society,
to take their place among...

31:02.164 --> 31:03.188
<i>O</i> h, enough!

31:03.231 --> 31:05.665
- And to contribute...
- Enough!

31:09.938 --> 31:11.963
How do we set up this bust?

31:13.842 --> 31:18.176
<i>Rod called Donner and told him he had
a buyer for all the grass he could supply.</i>

31:18.213 --> 31:21.080
<i>Donner was suspicious
but Rod acted very excited,</i>

31:21.116 --> 31:24.142
<i>asked for 20%/% commission
and settled for five.</i>

31:24.186 --> 31:27.314
<i>It was a performance
Olivier would have been proud of.</i>

31:27.356 --> 31:29.017
<i>Which is what worried me</i>.

31:29.057 --> 31:32.584
<i>When Rod wants,
he can lie with the best of them.</i>

31:32.627 --> 31:36.927
As soon as this thing's over with,
I'm gonna fly back to the mainland,

31:36.965 --> 31:38.432
get close with the kid.

31:39.434 --> 31:41.095
Spend some time with him.

31:41.136 --> 31:43.400
Take him out to play ball.

31:43.438 --> 31:45.099
Ride the ponies.

31:46.641 --> 31:49.838
- Sounds great.
- It is, man, it's the best.

31:51.346 --> 31:53.678
And I'm going to make it up to you, Tom.

31:54.683 --> 31:57.151
I don't know how yet, but I'm going to.

31:58.620 --> 32:03.853
Just see to it that little Hot Rod doesn't have
to drive to Camarillo to see you.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.491
For sure, buddy. For sure.

32:08.897 --> 32:12.333
I want you to know that
I was really getting it back together.

32:13.068 --> 32:16.367
A little slow, maybe, but I was doing it.

32:16.405 --> 32:18.464
Until that creep Donner came along.

32:18.507 --> 32:20.941
Creeps come with the lifestyle, Rod.

32:26.748 --> 32:29.080
You still don't believe me, do you?

32:30.385 --> 32:32.546
Mostly I do. I just, uh...

32:33.155 --> 32:36.591
I'd be lying if I didn't admit
that I had some doubts, that's all.

32:36.625 --> 32:41.392
Would I be pounding the pavement selling
encyclopedias if I was a dope dealer?

32:41.430 --> 32:44.797
- Now, really?
- No, probably not.

32:45.934 --> 32:50.428
Those suckers were heavy, man.
This arm's four inches longer than the other.

32:52.073 --> 32:54.166
You know, I got to admit,

32:54.209 --> 32:58.111
watching you trying to run
with that sample case

32:58.146 --> 33:02.776
was one of the funniest things
I've seen in a long time.

33:02.818 --> 33:06.219
Why didn't you just dump it
and run for daylight?

33:06.254 --> 33:11.692
What, are you kidding? A salesman never
leaves his sample case - rule number one.

33:11.726 --> 33:14.058
Come on, the chili's about ready.

33:14.095 --> 33:16.563
And the way you're gonna love it, too.

33:17.966 --> 33:20.526
Cayenne pepper, curry,

33:20.569 --> 33:22.332
beans, onions.

33:22.370 --> 33:25.066
I gave some to your mom, she loved it.

33:32.481 --> 33:37.418
Hey, man, we better hurry up
and eat this while it's still hot.

33:42.958 --> 33:46.257
I don't guess you'd believe that's oregano.

33:51.549 --> 33:54.916
- I can explain.
- I bet you can, Rod.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.911
You can always explain.

33:59.123 --> 34:03.184
I bet you got about half a dozen
all ready and waiting.

34:03.227 --> 34:05.855
<i>O</i> ne for every time you get caught.

34:05.896 --> 34:09.024
Let me tell you about it over the ch...
What are you doing?

34:09.065 --> 34:13.230
Give me another chance to explain.
For little Rodney's sake.

34:13.271 --> 34:15.739
- <i>Fifth Precinct</i>.
- <i>O</i> fficer Gordon, please.

34:15.773 --> 34:17.638
- <i>Hold, please</i>.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

34:17.675 --> 34:19.165
All right.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.542
Donner gave me ten keys to deliver.

34:22.446 --> 34:26.074
I kept just one of them.
I was gonna use the money to run.

34:26.117 --> 34:29.780
When a guy like Donner gets hold of you,
you don't get out of that.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.947
He'd've used me and used me.

34:31.989 --> 34:35.925
Then I get busted, and he either is gonna
off me or he sends me back to prison.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.155
I didn't have any other choice.

34:38.195 --> 34:40.186
Thomas.

34:40.965 --> 34:45.402
I know that I should have told you the truth,
but I couldn't.

34:46.404 --> 34:48.634
Don't ask me why, I just couldn't.

34:50.041 --> 34:55.206
You get to the point where if
you do one more wrong thing...

34:56.514 --> 34:58.812
you lose it all,

34:58.849 --> 35:01.215
no matter how good your friends are.

35:01.252 --> 35:03.777
That's the truth. I swear it.

35:03.821 --> 35:05.482
<i>Are you still holding?</i>

35:05.523 --> 35:07.081
Yeah, I'm still holding.

35:08.159 --> 35:11.128
You got to believe me.
I'm not a dope dealer.

35:11.162 --> 35:13.494
You delivered the stuff yourself.

35:13.531 --> 35:16.261
I mean, there was one key missing, right?

35:16.300 --> 35:21.397
If I'm a dope dealer,
am I gonna short the guys one key? Am I?

35:22.707 --> 35:25.505
Give me an answer, Thomas, please.

35:34.185 --> 35:35.914
Thank you, man.

35:37.254 --> 35:41.281
You're still gonna keep that meeting
with Donner at the park at ten.

35:42.159 --> 35:44.787
Right. Ten on the dot.

35:45.429 --> 35:48.796
And then when we get him,
I never want to see you again.

35:48.833 --> 35:51.996
- Thomas.
- No. Please, Rod, please.

35:54.638 --> 35:56.299
No visiting my mom.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.672
Just get out of my life for good.

35:59.977 --> 36:03.140
Thomas... if you feel that way...

36:05.049 --> 36:07.483
why are you going through all this for me?

36:08.986 --> 36:10.647
I'm not doing it for you, Rod.

36:12.456 --> 36:15.892
I'm doing it to get scum like Donner
off the street.

36:41.819 --> 36:43.787
Gotcha.

36:52.997 --> 36:55.056
Whatever you guys want, you have it.

36:55.099 --> 36:59.001
- We don't want you cutting into our territory.
- That's simple. You got it.

36:59.036 --> 37:01.834
Good. We'll make sure of that.

37:01.872 --> 37:06.605
You don't have to kill me, I'm gone,
this is me leaving here, I'm going to the airport,

37:06.644 --> 37:08.805
I'll see my kid, he's a three-year-old.

37:08.846 --> 37:11.406
- I'm gonna take him pony riding.
- That's nice.

37:11.449 --> 37:13.781
I like a man who cares about his kid.

37:13.818 --> 37:18.585
I hope your widow finds a guy
as good as you to look after him.

37:18.622 --> 37:21.022
I'm just a delivery boy.

37:21.058 --> 37:24.892
Uh-huh? The word is you suckered
those other haoles into that.

37:24.929 --> 37:27.329
I did, I did, but I'm not the main man.

37:27.364 --> 37:32.199
I'm gonna go to his place right now and
to the rest of his stash, which is 100 keys.

37:32.236 --> 37:34.568
A hun.

37:34.605 --> 37:38.405
If you off me and it's still floating around,
your boss won't like that.

37:38.442 --> 37:43.436
But you two guys could be real heroes,
you get my main man and 100 keys.

37:43.481 --> 37:45.915
In exchange for my life.

37:45.950 --> 37:47.417
Talk to me.

38:04.301 --> 38:05.359
You know,

38:05.402 --> 38:07.302
this is exciting.

38:07.338 --> 38:08.430
Very.

38:08.472 --> 38:14.069
All I get to do is talk to them after they've
served time. To actually be in on the kill.

38:15.312 --> 38:17.678
Figuratively speaking.

38:17.715 --> 38:19.376
Any sign of them?

38:19.416 --> 38:20.610
Not yet.

38:21.485 --> 38:24.648
You know, Tom, that guy's probably hal <i>fw</i> ay
to Frisco by now.

38:24.688 --> 38:27.384
Never trust a doper, they think different.

38:27.424 --> 38:29.289
Come on, guys, give me a break.

38:29.326 --> 38:31.954
We're giving you a break just by being here.

38:31.996 --> 38:34.556
Thomas is an expert
on the Hawaiian goose chase.

38:34.598 --> 38:36.327
The what?

38:36.367 --> 38:40.827
We once spent three weeks chasing
a band of Hungarian acrobats over the island.

38:42.640 --> 38:46.804
- It all started with that pair of black tights...
- He's here.

38:50.447 --> 38:52.108
My God.

38:52.149 --> 38:53.810
It's working.

38:58.589 --> 39:00.648
He's taking that gray compact.

39:00.691 --> 39:02.352
Let's hit it!

39:09.800 --> 39:13.361
- I thought we had a deal.
- We have, they just want to see a sample.

39:13.404 --> 39:17.864
They wanted me to bring them over here.
I said I'll bring you a lid and you can taste it.

39:17.908 --> 39:21.901
I don't want to risk 'em spotting you,
you know what I mean?

39:21.946 --> 39:25.347
Did I ever show you a picture of my kid?
Is that beautiful?

39:28.085 --> 39:31.145
I don't understand why
5-0 couldn't chauffeur you around.

39:31.188 --> 39:35.147
I told you, T.C., we're trying to keep
the cops out of it till we get Donner.

39:35.192 --> 39:40.220
And then when we catch Donner, the city's
going to reimburse me all of my expenses.

39:40.264 --> 39:45.395
- <i>O</i> f course.
- I'm talking about gas, time, damages.

39:45.436 --> 39:47.404
What damages?

39:47.972 --> 39:51.100
What do you think that is,
natural air conditioning?

39:51.842 --> 39:52.831
<i>O</i> h.

39:56.647 --> 39:59.309
Don't lose him! He's turning.

39:59.350 --> 40:01.682
Gee, whizz! A cop, huh?

40:02.419 --> 40:04.114
Parole officer.

40:12.796 --> 40:16.960
He's turning into that condo.
See if you can land on the roof.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.722
Uh... you guys go on.

40:43.761 --> 40:47.788
After she shuts down, I'll stay up here
and keep an eye on the street for Donner.

40:47.831 --> 40:49.696
If he tries to get away, I'll nab him.

40:49.733 --> 40:53.499
What are you gonna do?
Land on him with your helicopter?

40:57.107 --> 40:58.768
Do you have a gun?

41:01.078 --> 41:02.739
And a permit?

41:14.091 --> 41:16.150
They haven't caught an elevator yet.

41:31.742 --> 41:34.973
Hey. Why aren't they using the elevator?

41:35.012 --> 41:37.003
Aren't you going to your room?

41:37.047 --> 41:39.277
You think I'm nuts?

41:39.316 --> 41:43.650
<i>O</i> nly a yo-yo like you
would stash 100 keys in his room.

41:46.523 --> 41:49.720
- Maybe they're walking up.
- To the 14th floor?

41:49.760 --> 41:52.661
How do you know
Donner's going to the 14th floor?

41:52.696 --> 41:54.357
This is his condo.

41:55.666 --> 41:58.191
I thought you knew.

41:58.802 --> 42:03.034
<i>O</i> h, terrific. We got an elevator
before Donner, we'll beat him to his room.

42:03.073 --> 42:06.531
- That's not moving.
- They must still be in the garage.

42:06.577 --> 42:09.341
Is Donner dumb enough to keep
100 bricks in his room?

42:09.379 --> 42:11.779
- Nobody is that dumb.
- Then where?

42:13.016 --> 42:14.677
Somewhere in the garage.

42:18.689 --> 42:20.714
Well, hey, wait a minute.

42:20.758 --> 42:23.090
- Rick, keep her here.
- You got it.

42:23.127 --> 42:26.096
- He can't get away with that.
- He just did.

42:40.611 --> 42:44.775
<i>I didn't want to deprive
Parole Officer Gordon of the thrill of the kill,</i>

42:44.815 --> 42:49.775
<i>but my little voice was telling me
we might not be the only ones on this hunt.</i>

43:02.199 --> 43:04.565
<i>O</i> h, wow!

43:05.569 --> 43:07.230
Yeah. Wow.

43:07.271 --> 43:09.205
Where did you get this much, man?

43:09.239 --> 43:12.106
Put a little aside every time we make a bust.

43:12.142 --> 43:13.632
Adds up in no time.

43:13.677 --> 43:16.305
I'll bet it does. I wouldn't.

43:21.685 --> 43:23.016
Who the hell are you?

43:23.053 --> 43:24.714
- My buddy.
- I'm not your buddy.

43:24.755 --> 43:26.689
- Thomas, we got...
- Quiet.

43:26.723 --> 43:28.384
Let's just sit tight.

43:28.425 --> 43:30.985
We're waiting for Dolphie, aren't we?

43:37.467 --> 43:41.494
- I told you to keep her out of here.
- I tried. She threatened to arrest me.

43:41.538 --> 43:43.870
Thank God you're a police officer.

43:45.008 --> 43:47.408
I'm Parole <i>O</i> fficer Gordon.

43:47.444 --> 43:50.311
- Parole <i>O</i> fficer?
- You're under arrest.

43:50.347 --> 43:54.408
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you can say...

43:57.054 --> 43:58.783
Anything you may say...

43:58.822 --> 44:02.258
May say can be held against you
in a court of law.

44:02.292 --> 44:03.816
Look, Tom, I got to tell you...

44:03.861 --> 44:07.422
- We've got nothing to say to each other.
- I do. Drop 'em.

44:07.464 --> 44:08.795
I don't believe this.

44:08.832 --> 44:10.459
I said drop 'em.

44:12.202 --> 44:13.863
Check it out.

44:27.317 --> 44:31.310
- There's at least 100 bricks there.
- Well, I'll be damned.

44:31.355 --> 44:35.121
- What did I tell you? I don't lie.
- You little piece of crud.

44:35.158 --> 44:39.356
Hey, man, people in glasshouses
don't throw bricks.

44:39.396 --> 44:42.729
I'm looking out for number one.
I delivered like I promised.

44:42.766 --> 44:44.427
Yeah. <i>O</i> K.

44:44.468 --> 44:45.662
Split.

44:55.078 --> 44:58.514
- What are you gonna do to them?
- You gotta be kidding.

45:00.050 --> 45:02.075
I'm sorry, Tom. Really.

45:37.487 --> 45:39.284
All right. Freeze!

45:44.761 --> 45:45.785
All right.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.387
Freeze.

46:03.780 --> 46:05.407
Wow.

46:08.218 --> 46:13.019
The baron sent word that he and Miss El
would be leaving this afternoon.

46:14.925 --> 46:16.984
- He sent word?
- Yes.

46:17.027 --> 46:21.088
They haven't left their suite
since they arrived Thursday.

46:22.165 --> 46:26.727
- Five days.
- I just keep sending in food and drink.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.608
It's absolutely decadent.

46:36.346 --> 46:37.836
Come in.

46:40.183 --> 46:42.845
I'm going to be leaving.

46:44.087 --> 46:48.683
I got Rod a ticket home and a friend of mine in
LA will be his parole officer.

46:48.725 --> 46:52.320
Ah. Are you going to continue
selling encyclopedias?

46:52.362 --> 46:54.262
No, I got a job with a dealer.

46:55.132 --> 46:57.430
Used cars in Van Nuys.

46:57.467 --> 46:59.662
 Another friend.

47:00.270 --> 47:04.172
Well, I guess there's nothing
left to say except goodbye.

47:04.207 --> 47:06.141
Have a safe flight.

47:13.050 --> 47:16.713
You don't have to say anything.
I just want you to know I don't blame you.

47:16.753 --> 47:19.221
I deserve your condemnation.

47:20.824 --> 47:24.692
I'll never forget everything you did for me. Ever.

47:25.695 --> 47:27.686
I love you like a brother.

47:31.234 --> 47:33.225
Rod.

47:36.473 --> 47:38.907
Give little Hot Rod a hug for me.

47:40.143 --> 47:42.873
- Little Hot Rod?
- We'd better go. Aloha.

47:44.748 --> 47:46.409
It's his son.

47:49.419 --> 47:51.512
Rod doesn't have a son.
