00:03.211 --> 00:05.464
Hello, my name is Vince
and I'm an addict.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.799
- <i>I'm ready to get on with my life.</i>
- ( Crowd cheers )

00:07.965 --> 00:10.385
Did you guys get caught up in that
whole mining disaster?

00:10.551 --> 00:12.804
I really think there's a movie in it,
and I want to direct it too.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.098
I miss you.
I want to come home.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.017
- I'm not ready.
- Tell me what that means.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.061
I've been seeing someone.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.577
I've been in lockdown for three months.
I need some excitement.

00:21.702 --> 00:23.761
"Johnny Bananas" is a beast, bro.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.859
<i>It's funny, it's got heart.
Billy's killing it.</i>

00:26.082 --> 00:27.736
Doesn't seem like E's having fun.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.571
Why are you pissed
at me and nobody else?

00:29.737 --> 00:31.907
- You don't like my movie idea.
- No, I hate it.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.450
Vince is having like
a heart attack or something!

00:33.950 --> 00:36.703
None of this is real and none of you
are being real.

00:36.869 --> 00:40.165
- If everyone thinks my movie idea sucks--
- If it was on a network

00:40.331 --> 00:42.781
and Drama was the American,
I'd love it.

00:42.906 --> 00:45.796
- I love that.
- So do I.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.081
- Anybody smell smoke?
- ( Siren wailing )

I gotta tell you--
hotel living ain't all bad.

02:07.712 --> 02:09.588
Yeah, especially when you're
not paying for any of it.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.524
Who are you judging?
You're not paying for it either.

02:11.649 --> 02:13.258
- But I offered to.
- So did I.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.225
But Vince knew how traumatized I was

02:15.350 --> 02:17.058
from burning down the house,
didn't wanna make me feel worse.

02:17.183 --> 02:19.139
- That makes a lot of sense.
- <i>( Knocks on door )</i>

02:20.356 --> 02:21.532
- Yo.
- Yo.

02:21.657 --> 02:23.333
Why you dressed like it's '04?

02:23.458 --> 02:25.228
All my clothes burned up in the fire.

02:25.394 --> 02:27.671
Why are you dressed for
a bisexual paintball tournament

02:27.796 --> 02:29.149
- is a better question.
- Agreed.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.359
Bisexual?
This shirt is mad hetero.

02:31.525 --> 02:33.242
Look at these pythons.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.405
You can clearly see I'm hiding
an eight-pack under it.

02:35.571 --> 02:37.879
You haven't had an eight-pack to hide
since the early '70s, Drama.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.447
- If then.
- Whatever.

02:39.572 --> 02:42.583
- How's baby bro?
- Baby bro could not be better, Johnny.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.984
- Good morning to all.
- All: Morning.

02:45.109 --> 02:46.452
- You sleep?
- Not a wink.

02:46.577 --> 02:48.187
- Weird shirt, Johnny.
- Really?

02:48.312 --> 02:50.712
- Turtle: <i>What have you got there, Vin?</i>
- A script.

02:50.878 --> 02:52.839
- For what?
- Johnny's movie.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.517
- Nice.
- You wrote it?

02:54.807 --> 02:57.135
I couldn't sleep.
I just had to get it out.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.888
- It's only 20 pages.
- It's just an outline.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.307
Johnny: Whatever it is,
I love the proactive effort.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.402
- I'm still the lead, right, bro?
- Of course you are.

03:05.527 --> 03:06.978
- Nice.
- ( Turtle sighs )

03:07.229 --> 03:10.148
- So how's it look?
- Your grammar's horrible.

03:10.314 --> 03:11.065
Who cares?

03:11.190 --> 03:13.208
We were in the same classes
since we were six.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.736
It's just shocking to me
you can't punctuate.

03:14.902 --> 03:16.738
It was all stream of consciousness.

03:16.904 --> 03:17.989
You can't really spell either, Vin.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.483
- "Faithful" is f-a-I-t-h-f-e-l.
- No, it isn't.

03:21.764 --> 03:22.749
- It's o-l.
- No, it isn't.

03:23.035 --> 03:24.751
- So says you.
- Are you guys all illiterate?

03:24.876 --> 03:27.020
Mrs. Carbone would shoot
herself if she heard this.

03:27.145 --> 03:28.625
Who cares about
my spelling or grammar?

03:28.791 --> 03:30.085
<i>That's not what this is about.</i>

03:30.251 --> 03:33.460
This is about a start--
a good start to a great story.

03:33.585 --> 03:34.828
We're gonna find you a great writer

03:34.953 --> 03:36.633
- to help you flesh this thing out.
- I already found one.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.468
- In your room?
- <i>I was thinking,</i>

03:38.634 --> 03:40.331
since Billy did such
a great job on Johnny's show,

03:40.456 --> 03:41.513
we should give him
the first shot at this.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.600
- What do you think?
- I like it.

03:42.725 --> 03:44.168
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>
- I <i>love</i> it.

03:44.293 --> 03:46.935
The guy knows my voice
like Scorsese knows De Niro's.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.039
- ( Chuckles )
- Sloan?

03:49.164 --> 03:51.941
Wow, she must really want you to get
your shit out of her place, huh?

03:52.066 --> 03:54.985
I guess so.
Hello?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.071
- Hey, Eric.
- <i>Hey.</i>

03:57.196 --> 03:58.676
Fuck you!

04:01.641 --> 04:03.034
What'd she say?

04:04.952 --> 04:07.221
- "Fuck you"?
- That's harsh.

04:07.346 --> 04:08.989
- Yeah, I'd say.
- Can somebody really be that mad

04:09.114 --> 04:11.492
- about leftover socks and underwear?
- I don't know.

04:11.617 --> 04:14.495
- At least she called you.
- You still haven't gotten ahold of Alex?

04:14.620 --> 04:17.298
One Tequila ad and the girl thinks
she's Angelina Jolie.

04:19.132 --> 04:22.031
- She'd share the spotlight with you.
- I don't want the spotlight.

04:22.157 --> 04:23.970
- I just want to talk to my girlfriend.
- It's tough adjusting

04:24.095 --> 04:26.505
to the attention she's getting.
Give her a little more time, Turtle.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.406
Yeah. And what do I do about Sloan?

04:28.531 --> 04:30.741
Well, I'd get my shit out of there
before she works herself up

04:30.866 --> 04:33.440
- into an Elin Nordegren state.
- I'll go today.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.812
- Vince: Want me to roll with?
- E: I'm fine.

04:34.937 --> 04:36.546
I'll just make sure she's not there.

04:36.671 --> 04:37.736
Make sure to leave a mess.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.481
That'll show her
not to talk to you like that.

04:39.606 --> 04:41.783
- Good thinking.
- I was gonna say jerk off on the bed.

04:41.908 --> 04:43.851
- Yeah, that's even a better idea, Turtle.
- All right, off to work.

04:43.976 --> 04:46.161
- Have fun, kids.
- ( Eric laughs )

04:47.028 --> 04:49.414
Johnny: Still hard to believe
he's got a job.

04:49.647 --> 04:51.257
<i>( Elevator dings )</i>

04:51.382 --> 04:54.158
- Good morning, Ari.
- Why are you lying in wait, Lloyd?

04:54.283 --> 04:56.761
I had some things to tell you and wanted
to be sure to catch you

04:56.886 --> 04:59.364
- before you got distracted.
- Can it wait till I get to my office?

04:59.489 --> 05:02.432
Well, there's two things.
I can tell you one now...

05:02.557 --> 05:04.701
- ...And one when we get to your office.
- You pregnant?

05:04.826 --> 05:07.337
I'd never carry a baby after all
the hard work I've put into this body.

05:07.462 --> 05:09.806
- Speak.
- I had my breakfast meeting

05:09.931 --> 05:12.007
- with Steven Levitan this morning.
- Congrats.

05:12.132 --> 05:13.909
You gonna be the new gay
on "Modern Family"?

05:14.034 --> 05:15.477
No. I'm gonna be the new agent

05:15.602 --> 05:17.746
of one of the biggest
showrunners in the business.

05:17.871 --> 05:19.480
- Very impressive.
- It's not a done deal.

05:19.605 --> 05:21.988
Well, make it a done deal
and I'll pay for the lipo

05:22.154 --> 05:24.324
so you can stop fretting about all
that failed dieting.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.118
Keep going.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.553
Well, Mr. Levitan is concerned

05:28.678 --> 05:30.521
that this may not be
the smartest place for him,

05:30.646 --> 05:32.582
seeing as how our TV department
is kind of defunct.

05:32.748 --> 05:34.992
- Well, tell him it isn't.
- I'm not a good liar, Ari.

05:35.117 --> 05:38.213
Truth is, it needs a new head and
I'd like to be the one to re-funct it.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.164
- Is that the second thing?
- No.

05:40.289 --> 05:41.883
Well, tell that to me
and then I'll decide.

05:42.049 --> 05:44.569
- This one is harder to share.
- You've got 30 seconds!

05:44.904 --> 05:46.096
My meeting was at Flay's.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.640
Did they take the Ari golden
corn tamale off the menu?

05:48.806 --> 05:50.174
- No, it's still there.
- What?

05:50.901 --> 05:53.812
Speak or I'll rip your tongue out
and serve it to my son's lizard.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.669
Your wife was there also.

05:57.904 --> 05:59.147
- My wife hates that place.
- I know.

05:59.272 --> 06:01.820
- That's why I found it strange.
- Jake!

06:01.986 --> 06:04.118
Call Flay's and get Robert on the phone.
Who was she with?

06:04.243 --> 06:06.199
I didn't see anyone.
And she left in a hurry.

06:06.365 --> 06:06.993
I don't think she saw me.

06:07.118 --> 06:09.160
- Wait, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna do what you should have done:

06:09.326 --> 06:11.246
- Find out who she was with.
- <i>They said he's not there.</i>

06:11.412 --> 06:14.022
I want you to call any one of his
50 trillion restaurants

06:14.147 --> 06:16.158
- and when you get him, get me.
- Where are you going?

06:16.283 --> 06:18.026
I'm gonna take off.
Clear my schedule.

06:18.151 --> 06:20.161
Him too.
You're coming with me.

06:20.286 --> 06:22.663
Do you think that's wise given the state
of the TV department?

06:22.788 --> 06:23.964
I don't give a fuck
about the TV department.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.599
All I care about
is who convinced my wife

06:25.724 --> 06:27.600
to go to a restaurant she hates!

06:27.887 --> 06:31.204
Well, if it isn't the balding Kentucky
fried chicken.

06:31.329 --> 06:33.935
- You're pissing me off, Ronald!
- Why? What did I say?

06:34.101 --> 06:36.336
You told me you had sex with my wife.
Ruffy!

06:36.461 --> 06:38.110
I fucking love this.

06:38.235 --> 06:40.145
<i>Kids, get out here!</i>

06:40.270 --> 06:41.568
You having fun with this, Billy?

06:41.734 --> 06:42.914
I'm having the time of my life.

06:43.039 --> 06:45.149
You and Johnny
have amazing chemistry,

06:45.274 --> 06:47.183
probably more so
than we did in "Medellin."

06:47.308 --> 06:49.085
- Ah, just show it to him.
- Show me what?

06:49.210 --> 06:50.657
- Vince wrote a script.
- ( Clears throat )

06:51.660 --> 06:53.163
What is it?
A short?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.123
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.963
The producer's come
to check on his workers.

06:57.088 --> 06:57.626
Good to see you, Phil.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.127
- What's going on, Eric? Vince.
- Show's looking great.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.713
- Right, isn't it? Come on.
- Really funny.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.732
- Hey guys, let's call it for today.
- Almost a two-hour day.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.332
God, I love this job!

07:06.457 --> 07:09.067
Vince, what do you think?
Your brother gonna be a star or what?

07:09.192 --> 07:10.236
I'm loving what I'm seeing, Phil.

07:10.361 --> 07:11.571
- How you doing?
- Great.

07:11.696 --> 07:14.074
Yeah? My brother had a meth problem.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.009
It's been a tough road,
but he's fighting the fight.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.701
You ever need someone to talk to...

07:18.379 --> 07:19.355
- Thanks.
- You got it.

07:19.521 --> 07:21.013
Hey Phil, you like that scene?

07:21.138 --> 07:24.483
- Yeah, it looks great.
- ( Both laugh )

07:24.608 --> 07:26.988
Hopefully, an audience will
think so as well, huh?

07:27.154 --> 07:29.115
Why wouldn't they?

07:29.281 --> 07:31.955
I'm just saying.
We're testing the show this afternoon.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.913
- Came by to let you guys know.
- Well, how are you feeling about it?

07:35.079 --> 07:36.873
- How am I feeling about what?
- The show, Phil.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.167
I feel confident.
Anew, I feel confident.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.296
You know what?
Maybe I'm not as confident as you.

07:41.421 --> 07:45.833
Can we come along, maybe see a real
audience possibly laugh at this stuff?

07:45.958 --> 07:48.718
That would make me feel more confident.
What about you, Drama?

07:48.884 --> 07:50.804
Come on, what happened
to you, Andrew, huh?

07:50.929 --> 07:53.932
This guy used to sell out
arenas, just him and a Mike.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.209
You know, that was a long time ago and
now you got me playing an orangutan.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.411
Now look, we've all been
humbled in this group here.

07:59.536 --> 08:01.731
- Well...
- But we will all prevail.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.881
- I hear that.
- All right. So is that a yes?

08:04.006 --> 08:04.984
Can we come watch?

08:05.150 --> 08:07.184
Yeah, you guys can come.
And you-- you can come too.

08:07.309 --> 08:09.197
I'll see you later.
I'll send everybody the address.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.054
- Later, Phil.
- <i>You got it.</i>

08:11.179 --> 08:12.575
( Mutters )
Jerk-off.

08:12.741 --> 08:14.858
Is this exciting stuff or what?

08:14.983 --> 08:17.460
- We're gonna murder "The Simpsons."
- It's gonna be great.

08:17.585 --> 08:18.961
- Yo, Christian!
- Hey, Drama!

08:19.086 --> 08:20.929
Go fuck yourself.

08:21.054 --> 08:22.464
- What the fuck?
- Vince: <i>What'd you do?</i>

08:22.589 --> 08:26.168
- No clue.
- Drama, Drama, can I talk to you a second?

08:26.293 --> 08:27.903
Guys, we'll be right there, okay?
Just a walk.

08:28.028 --> 08:30.739
- What? What?
- No no no. No, I think it's really cute

08:30.864 --> 08:33.471
how you and the guys and your
manager are like real buddies.

08:33.636 --> 08:35.910
Yeah, we've known each other
since we were little kids.

08:36.035 --> 08:38.601
- You trust him?
- He's like blood. Why?

08:38.767 --> 08:41.250
My ex-wife made the deal
for me on this show

08:41.375 --> 08:44.186
and since the split,
I feel exposed, you know?

08:44.311 --> 08:45.817
I mean, if something
were to come down,

08:45.983 --> 08:48.528
I don't know if I'd have
the faculties to deal with it.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.197
I've been fired off of shows
after test screenings.

08:51.363 --> 08:52.323
Who hasn't?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.405
You think the little guy
might take a meeting with me?

08:54.530 --> 08:56.499
- Yeah, of course. Of course.
- Like now?

08:56.785 --> 08:58.801
- Come on. E?
- Yeah?

08:58.926 --> 09:01.124
Dice is looking
for proper representation.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.871
- Yeah?
- Would you be up for a little sit-down?

09:03.996 --> 09:05.336
- Yeah.
- Today?

09:05.502 --> 09:07.964
- Today?
- Or even sooner.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.069
I can't do it today.

09:09.194 --> 09:11.246
He's gotta clear out
all his stuff from his ex's.

09:11.371 --> 09:13.261
Ah, I've been there too many times.
Trust me.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.513
My last ex incinerated all my stuff.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.974
But my partner's at my office right now
if you wanna sit down and talk to him.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.984
- That's a great idea. You'll love Scott.
- Oh, I get it.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.687
I'm getting handed off already,
but I appreciate it.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.323
- Not gettin' handed off.
- No, I appreciate it really. Thank you.

09:25.448 --> 09:26.482
Thank you.

09:27.683 --> 09:29.894
Hey Alex, it's me again.

09:30.019 --> 09:31.795
Things are good here, crazy busy,

09:31.920 --> 09:34.730
but like I said last night
I burned Vince's house down,

09:34.855 --> 09:36.598
so maybe you wanna
give me a call back?

09:36.723 --> 09:38.732
- Alex?
- Voicemail.

09:38.857 --> 09:40.257
I saw her on TV last night.

09:40.537 --> 09:41.601
- ( Chuckles ) On TV?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

09:41.726 --> 09:43.268
At the heat game, floor seats.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.710
She was wearing her avion t-shirt
and she looked super hot.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.136
I don't wanna get you
jealous or anything,

09:48.261 --> 09:50.840
but I'm pretty sure
Lebron winked at her.

09:51.006 --> 09:52.383
I'm totes kidding.

09:52.549 --> 09:54.208
- Real funny.
- ( Chuckles )

09:54.333 --> 09:56.143
( Laughs ) Oh, is she
having so much fun.

09:56.268 --> 09:58.579
Oh, I talked to her last night.

09:58.704 --> 10:00.308
She said Miami is beyond dope.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.769
- You talked to her?
- Yeah.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.395
Really.

10:04.561 --> 10:05.855
Is that okay?

10:07.210 --> 10:08.942
- Totes.
- Sarah: <i>You sure?</i>

10:09.108 --> 10:11.091
- You seem kind of sad.
- Nah. No, I'm not sad.

10:11.216 --> 10:13.340
I'm just trying to hold
the fort down here, all right?

10:13.465 --> 10:14.495
So let's get back to work.

10:14.754 --> 10:17.867
Sarah, Abby, you guys are hitting
sunset in the promo van.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.833
And Rachel, I need you hitting
all the gyms and spas.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.644
I want a line out the door tonight,
all right?

10:21.769 --> 10:22.001
Got it.

10:22.126 --> 10:24.249
- All right, go! Abby, hold on?
- Yeah.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.372
When you talked to Alex,

10:26.497 --> 10:29.308
- did she sound okay? Anything weird?
- No.

10:29.433 --> 10:30.922
You're totally being weird though.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.133
- No, I'm not.
- You're kinda dressed weird.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.151
- I was sitting there.
- Uh-huh.

10:40.276 --> 10:42.486
I had the muesli and, okay,
I had a chocolate scone,

10:42.611 --> 10:44.721
- but I work hard and I deserve it.
- Where was she?

10:44.846 --> 10:46.523
- Over there.
- Was she alone?

10:46.648 --> 10:48.356
<i>I told you, she was just leaving.</i>

10:48.522 --> 10:50.459
- Was there another place setting?
- I don't remember.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.869
Focus, Lloyd.

10:51.994 --> 10:54.763
I'm trying, Ari, but this all has me
<i>very</i> rattled.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.931
Mr. Gold!
How are you?

10:57.056 --> 10:58.766
- Uh, table for two?
- Actually no, James.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.135
I have a question for you.
Did you see my wife this morning?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.436
Oh, I didn't work this morning.
Uh, David did.

11:03.561 --> 11:05.738
- Is everything all right, Mr. Gold?
- Yeah.

11:05.863 --> 11:08.626
- David? Excuse me. Hey.
- Hi, how are you?

11:08.792 --> 11:10.044
- Good.
- Ah, and you too. Back for more?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.614
Actually we're back 'cause I'm
gonna ask you a question.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.924
Did you serve a brunette-- pretty,
young-looking 40s-- this morning?

11:15.090 --> 11:15.784
Looks 32.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.468
- Yeah, I know, your wife.
She comes in every morning.

11:17.634 --> 11:20.638
- Really? Since when?
- Last few weeks at least.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.619
- Who did she come with?
- No one.

11:22.890 --> 11:26.390
She sits alone.
That's so sad.

11:26.515 --> 11:30.106
I think she misses you, Ari, and she
wants to see your name on the menu.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.363
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.966
- He seems nice.
- He's an asshole, Lloyd.

11:36.091 --> 11:37.634
Hey Robbie.

11:37.759 --> 11:39.824
Sorry I couldn't help
but overhear, Mr. Gold,

11:39.990 --> 11:42.005
but if your wife is here
alone <i>every</i> morning,

11:42.130 --> 11:44.541
I'm sure David is trying
everything he can to get with her.

11:44.666 --> 11:47.540
- Yeah, my wife would not date that guy.
- Oh dear.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.379
Rumor is he's already
nailed three of four

11:49.504 --> 11:51.002
"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."

11:51.168 --> 11:54.297
<i>Bravo couldn't air it
because it was too racy.</i>

11:54.463 --> 11:56.784
- But he seems so nice.
- He's a sociopath.

11:56.909 --> 11:59.927
Probably why he's actually a good actor,
unlike most of the waiters in this town.

12:00.392 --> 12:02.294
He's testing for a huge
arc on "Mad Men" today.

12:02.419 --> 12:04.610
My wife would never date
a fucking waiter.

12:06.681 --> 12:08.824
Some of us do have
good hearts, Mr. Gold,

12:08.949 --> 12:10.980
despite our social standing.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.996
- So what's he saying?
- Nothing. He hasn't said a word in an hour.

12:17.277 --> 12:19.131
- It's only 20 pages.
- I don't know.

12:19.256 --> 12:21.032
- He's a deep thinker.
- Shh.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.412
- <i>Did you find the watch?</i>
- No, she probably sold it.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.792
- What the fuck?
- I gotta go.

12:27.917 --> 12:31.000
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was, uh-- looking for my watch.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.442
In my underwear.

12:33.567 --> 12:36.411
I was looking for other things too.
What are you doing home from work?

12:36.536 --> 12:38.313
I quit my job a few weeks ago.

12:38.438 --> 12:40.510
- Really?
- Really.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.809
I got your message today.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.972
I was returning your
call from last night.

12:45.210 --> 12:48.059
- And you said fuck you to me.
- That's what you said to me.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.144
- What? When?
- Last night.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.221
- I did not.
- Really?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.150
E's voice:
<i>Fuck you!</i>

12:57.986 --> 13:00.230
Sloan, that's me yelling
at your answering machine.

13:00.355 --> 13:01.831
I tried four times
to leave a message.

13:01.956 --> 13:04.633
That lady keeps cutting me off, asking
me if I wanna listen to the message,

13:04.758 --> 13:06.001
- replay the message--
- Whatever, Eric.

13:06.126 --> 13:08.066
I don't give a shit.
Here's your watch.

13:10.163 --> 13:12.917
Wow, you were wearing it.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.149
I paid for it.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.478
Pleasure as always, Sloan.

13:17.603 --> 13:20.299
( Sighs ) Eric, I didn't mean that.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.973
( Sighs )

13:24.308 --> 13:26.055
You really think
I would say that to you?

13:28.348 --> 13:29.988
That's sad, Sloan.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.354
I would <i>never</i> say that to you.
Please know that.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.526
I just hate

13:35.651 --> 13:37.762
that we ended things
with so much anger

13:37.887 --> 13:40.570
after <i>everything</i> we've
been through together.

13:41.394 --> 13:42.198
Me too.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.873
Okay, so what's your biggest concern?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.944
Getting fucked.
I've been fucked a lot.

13:50.069 --> 13:52.413
- Hear that.
- Who has not been fucked in this town?

13:52.538 --> 13:54.882
- Amen.
- Maybe I've been fucked more than most--

13:55.007 --> 13:57.003
- even him.
- ( Chuckles ) I don't know about that.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.587
Oh, really? I used to live on
three acres in Beverly hills.

14:00.712 --> 14:03.156
Now I live in apartment
in Encino with my wife,

14:03.281 --> 14:05.048
my kids and a sick fucking cat.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.559
- He's got you beat, Drama.
- Maybe 'cause of the cat.

14:07.684 --> 14:10.128
Look, I need somebody that's
really gonna have my back.

14:10.253 --> 14:13.197
I have your back, okay?

14:13.322 --> 14:15.799
And you'll sign me just like that.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.868
Absolutely. I've seen
"Johnny's Bananas."

14:17.993 --> 14:19.692
And I think it's a massive hit.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.028
- I ain't gonna pay a dime on "Bananas."
- Why would you?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.239
I'm gonna get paid on the next
thing and the next thing, drew.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.990
"Diceman's Big Comeback." Look at it.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.933
Huh?
Were you a fan?

14:28.241 --> 14:30.703
Was I fan? I could recite your whole
act when I was in high school.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.146
- Really?
- "Hickory dickory dock,

14:32.412 --> 14:34.115
this chick was sucking my cock.
The clock struck two,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.073
"I dropped my goo, and I dumped
the bitch at the next block."

14:36.375 --> 14:38.398
- Fuck with me.
- I think my timing's a little better,

14:38.523 --> 14:40.366
- but you know what? Let's do this.
- Come on.

14:40.491 --> 14:42.173
- Thank you really.
- Hey, thank you.

14:49.318 --> 14:52.954
- ( Sighs ) Billy--
- Shh.

14:54.556 --> 14:56.145
( Sighs )

14:56.311 --> 14:58.314
- ( Loud thud )
- I like it!

14:58.480 --> 14:59.903
Why can't you just say that?

15:00.273 --> 15:01.905
I wanted to say it in a way
that'd make you feel good

15:02.030 --> 15:04.779
so that if I tell you what I don't
like you'll still feel good.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.459
I'm not that sensitive, Billy.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.578
Vince, you've taken the blank
page, you've put something down.

15:09.703 --> 15:11.369
You now know what it is to
have put yourself out there.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.914
And if I were to tell you
that it sucks, it would hurt.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.958
- Does it suck?
- Some of it sucks.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.785
- It does hurt.
- But I can fix it.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.379
So fix it.
Change whatever you want.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.323
I will take nothing personally
because this movie is not for me.

15:24.589 --> 15:27.157
- It's for Johnny.
- Amazing selflessness.

15:27.282 --> 15:30.592
I'm gonna use some of that attitude
for the yellow lab's personality

15:30.717 --> 15:32.682
- if that's okay.
- It's okay.

15:34.487 --> 15:36.764
- I've got Marci Sanders.
- Put her through.

15:36.889 --> 15:38.665
Is she fucking a waiter?

15:38.937 --> 15:40.924
I don't know anything about anything.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.109
- Tell me she's not fucking a waiter.
- <i>Ari,</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:46.237
you know I would never
betray my <i>sister.</i>

15:46.403 --> 15:48.429
Your sister and your parents
betrayed you.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.374
<i>They cut you off financially
because they think</i>

15:50.499 --> 15:53.311
- <i>you're an unstable alcoholic...</i>
- It's a matter of opinion.

15:53.436 --> 15:55.814
...Who will give all your money away
to the first man that smiles at you.

15:55.939 --> 15:58.416
I'm all you got.
Is she fucking a waiter?!

15:58.582 --> 16:00.951
I don't know
if she's <i>fucking</i> anybody!

16:01.076 --> 16:04.505
- Who's she seeing?
- Please. Please?

16:04.671 --> 16:06.024
You owe me, Marci, all right?

16:06.149 --> 16:08.182
There's no telling what will
happen to those tuition checks

16:08.307 --> 16:11.470
- if I lose my mind.
- Don't you threaten my children!

16:11.636 --> 16:16.475
Lance is doing so well now.
He actually got a c-minus in geometry.

16:16.641 --> 16:18.477
Great. Maybe he's
ready to get a job then.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.503
( Sighs ) All right, Ari.

16:20.628 --> 16:24.239
Look, she said she's got some guy

16:24.364 --> 16:25.484
at a restaurant,

16:26.455 --> 16:28.676
but that she's too embarrassed
to tell me about him.

16:28.801 --> 16:30.865
I mean, that's all
I really know. <i>Really.</i>

16:31.031 --> 16:33.471
Embarrassed?

16:34.506 --> 16:35.982
( Shouts ) Lloyd!

16:36.107 --> 16:38.205
( Softly ) She's fucking a waiter.

16:38.371 --> 16:40.052
Yes, Ari.

16:40.177 --> 16:41.876
Do you still wanna be head
of the TV department?

16:42.042 --> 16:44.756
I would let u pull out all my
fingernails with pliers for the honor.

16:44.881 --> 16:46.791
I want you to call over
to the "Mad Men" offices.

16:46.916 --> 16:49.193
I want you to get everyone--
from Matt Weiner to the P.A.S--

16:49.318 --> 16:52.511
to treat that waiter like shit,
humiliate him and send him packing.

16:52.677 --> 16:55.398
- I don't know if I can--
- If I see that kid on the "Mad Men" set,

16:55.523 --> 16:57.600
I'm gonna be a mad
fucking man, all right?

16:57.766 --> 17:01.003
If I see him anywhere--
even as a puss-faced zombie

17:01.128 --> 17:03.605
in "The Walking Dead," I'm gonna
shoot someone in the head.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.566
Get it done!

17:07.901 --> 17:10.905
( Both sigh )

17:15.240 --> 17:17.650
- You didn't say anything?
- No. Neither of us did.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.952
- Did you say anything during?
- I don't remember.

17:20.077 --> 17:21.753
- What, did you tell her you love her?
- No.

17:21.878 --> 17:23.422
- Well, do you?
- Of course I love her.

17:23.547 --> 17:25.424
I'll always love her.
We were supposed to get married next month.

17:25.549 --> 17:28.326
Yeah, no shit.
My gift was non-refundable.

17:28.451 --> 17:30.462
You know, we never even
really officially broke up.

17:30.587 --> 17:32.864
I mean, we basically had a
massive fight and I left.

17:32.989 --> 17:35.067
I think it was officially over
when she canceled the catering

17:35.192 --> 17:37.102
- and sent the ring back.
- Hey look, E,

17:37.227 --> 17:39.438
you're saving yourself a lot of
heartache and a lot of money.

17:39.563 --> 17:43.175
- Marriage is for suckers.
- Dice, didn't you just get married?

17:43.300 --> 17:45.911
- Yeah, but I'm weak.
- So how did you leave it then?

17:46.036 --> 17:47.847
We didn't.
She just got up and left.

17:47.972 --> 17:49.849
Wait, I thought-- I thought
you were at her place.

17:49.974 --> 17:51.784
- We were.
- She left her own house?

17:51.909 --> 17:54.119
- I love that.
- Yo, what did I miss?

17:54.244 --> 17:57.121
E and Sloan got back together
and then broke up again.

17:57.246 --> 17:59.357
Really? Good,
we'll all be single again

17:59.482 --> 18:01.184
'cause I think I'm gonna break up
with Alex too.

18:01.309 --> 18:01.959
That is shocking.

18:02.084 --> 18:03.374
Yeah, she's a good girl.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.501
No no, it's shocking that
he could break up with anybody.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.197
- Ah.
- What happened?

18:07.322 --> 18:09.672
She called Abby,
but she hasn't called me.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.508
Maybe she's gone lesbo and
is too ashamed to tell you.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.270
- Who would be ashamed of that?
- ( Laughs )

18:14.395 --> 18:16.178
I really think she wants
the fame more than me.

18:16.344 --> 18:18.006
- She's the avion girl.
- Yeah.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.682
Get the fuck out of here.
She's hot.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.599
- Yeah.
- How did <i>you</i> get her?

18:21.724 --> 18:23.511
- ( Eric laughs )
- I don't know, dice.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.688
And you banged Tony soprano's
daughter for awhile.

18:25.854 --> 18:29.108
- What, did you Google me? Yeah, I did.
- Guy must have a horse cock.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.318
No no, I've shared a locker
room with him. It was...

18:32.694 --> 18:34.447
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
- Phil!

18:34.613 --> 18:36.866
- ( Sighs )
- What's the word?

18:38.612 --> 18:41.829
- I got scores. Um...
- What? No good?

18:43.128 --> 18:45.126
- Through the roof.
- Yeah!

18:45.251 --> 18:48.502
We air in three weeks and
it cannot come sooner.

18:48.668 --> 18:50.546
Hey, Scott Lavin.
I represent dice.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.339
Lucky you. The guy's a star.
I gotta get back.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.800
- Congratulations, Phil.
- Later, bro.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.102
- I knew it, I knew it.
- You did not.

18:57.227 --> 18:59.638
- You were nervous.
- No, I just don't count my chickens

18:59.763 --> 19:02.939
before they hatch.
But now that they have, I am clear--

19:03.064 --> 19:04.967
- we are golden.
- We always were golden.

19:05.092 --> 19:06.908
And hey, Drama,
once I finish that movie,

19:07.033 --> 19:08.814
you might have two
emmy nods this year, huh?

19:08.980 --> 19:11.113
Oh please God, please please
please, I've suffered enough.

19:11.238 --> 19:14.049
- I deserve good things.
- They're coming, Johnny. They're coming.

19:14.174 --> 19:16.685
Let's hit the bar.
E and Turtle could use a drink.

19:16.810 --> 19:19.054
- Turtle: Yes.
- E: No kidding.

19:19.179 --> 19:20.655
Drama, can I talk to you a second?

19:20.780 --> 19:23.037
We'll be right there.
Just got to talk to Drama for a second.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.542
- I'll see you guys out there. What's up?
- Nothing.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.958
You know, I gotta thank
you for the gig.

19:28.124 --> 19:30.731
- Please.
- No. I was dead.

19:30.856 --> 19:32.423
You asked them to look
at me and they did.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.840
That's 'cause I knew you would kill it.
And you did.

19:35.006 --> 19:36.434
- Yeah, but um--
- But what?

19:36.559 --> 19:39.137
But our deal sucks.
They're paying us shit.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.572
- That's 'cause we had no leverage.
- Well, you know what?

19:41.697 --> 19:43.239
- I say we walk.
- Walk where?

19:43.364 --> 19:46.185
- Off the show.
- The show hasn't even aired yet.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.395
Yeah, but we've already won.
You heard Phil.

19:48.561 --> 19:52.113
After they exploit our voices and sell
10 million of them fucking monkeys

19:52.238 --> 19:54.648
- without giving us a dime--
- You're fucking with me, right?

19:54.773 --> 19:57.251
No. You know what I say?
We do the fucking.

19:57.376 --> 20:00.320
Me and you, Drama, we do the fucking.

20:00.445 --> 20:03.156
- Let's talk to our people.
- You know what?

20:03.281 --> 20:05.124
First we talk and then we walk.

20:05.249 --> 20:07.998
Drama, we do the fucking!

20:08.164 --> 20:10.084
Good afternoon, TMA.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.332
Please hold.

20:14.457 --> 20:15.923
( Softly ) Ari's wife is here.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.759
Really?
Uh...

20:18.425 --> 20:19.260
<i>Okay, yeah.
Thanks.</i>

20:21.764 --> 20:24.040
Ari, your wife's here.

20:24.165 --> 20:26.442
Hello hello!
It's been too long.

20:26.567 --> 20:29.136
I saw you peering at me from behind
the latte machine this morning.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.247
I know.
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

20:31.372 --> 20:34.283
I just saw you. And I don't think
I've ever not seen you two together,

20:34.408 --> 20:37.553
- so I-- I just wish you <i>were</i> together!
- I know, Lloyd.

20:37.678 --> 20:40.865
Because you are like, the perfect
couple-- like lady di and Charles.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.523
Lady di and Charles got
divorced and then she died.

20:42.648 --> 20:43.877
Now shut the fuck up.

20:44.002 --> 20:46.159
I'm sorry. Bye-bye.
My intentions are good.

20:46.284 --> 20:48.194
- All right, <i>his</i> intentions are good.
- What's going on?

20:48.557 --> 20:50.196
Can we talk about this
 in your office, please?

20:50.321 --> 20:51.208
Yeah, sure.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.966
- So--
- My sister is hysterical!

20:55.091 --> 20:55.959
What? Why?

20:56.084 --> 20:57.461
She doesn't wanna be
in the middle of this.

20:57.586 --> 20:59.704
- The middle of what?
- Ari, we are separated.

20:59.829 --> 21:01.506
You need to stay out of my life.

21:01.631 --> 21:03.475
Well, your separate life

21:03.600 --> 21:06.411
creeps into my life, all right?

21:06.536 --> 21:08.446
You'd have to move
to Iowa for it not to.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.358
As it is--

21:09.483 --> 21:11.103
Did you screw up David's audition
at "Mad Men"?

21:11.269 --> 21:14.717
David? You're actually
seeing a fucking waiter?

21:14.842 --> 21:17.919
Would you really just randomly
try and destroy someone's life?

21:18.044 --> 21:21.088
A waiter who is fucking
my wife at a restaurant

21:21.213 --> 21:23.657
that I basically built is not <i>random.</i>

21:23.782 --> 21:25.159
Did you really ruin his audition?

21:26.485 --> 21:28.895
You know, I'm not gonna
answer that until you do.

21:29.020 --> 21:32.458
Ari, please!
You need to let me live my life.

21:33.172 --> 21:35.299
If there's any chance of us
ever getting back together,

21:35.424 --> 21:37.588
I need to explore other things.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.669
If there's any chance for
us to get back together,

21:39.794 --> 21:42.801
you cannot be exploring
a fucking waiter!

21:42.967 --> 21:45.239
- It is <i>humiliating!</i>
- <i>First of all,</i>

21:45.364 --> 21:48.971
it is far less humiliating than the things
that you've put me through over the years.

21:49.096 --> 21:50.610
<i>And second of all,</i>

21:51.566 --> 21:52.834
I'm not dating David.

21:53.728 --> 21:55.522
Then how do you know about
this and why do you care?

21:55.688 --> 21:58.572
Because I am dating
someone who cares.

21:58.697 --> 22:00.903
- Who?
- His boss.

22:02.476 --> 22:05.157
Bobby? Flay.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.491
- You're dating a cook?
- He's a chef, Ari.

22:10.616 --> 22:11.925
And he's a businessman.

22:12.050 --> 22:14.761
And he's kind and
respectful and generous.

22:14.886 --> 22:18.337
He's a redheaded fire crotch.
He's a genetic mistake.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.006
Jesus, Ari, you are such a child. I--

22:22.227 --> 22:24.471
hey, if you have
any sense of decency,

22:24.596 --> 22:27.174
you <i>will</i> fix what you did to David.

22:27.299 --> 22:30.307
<i>( Music playing )</i>

22:35.441 --> 22:37.051
Everyone hear my words:

22:37.176 --> 22:38.352
Bobby flay

22:38.477 --> 22:40.854
is now my sworn enemy

22:40.979 --> 22:42.611
which means he is yours.

22:42.777 --> 22:45.858
Now if anyone eats or even recommends

22:45.983 --> 22:49.195
any one of that boy-meets-grill
fuck's establishments,

22:49.320 --> 22:51.745
it will be agent meets fist!

22:55.582 --> 22:57.668
Hey, Alex, I don't know
if you remember me.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.703
It's your boyfriend Turtle.

22:59.828 --> 23:01.773
This is the last time
I'm calling you.

23:01.898 --> 23:05.511
So give me a call back, tell me why
you're not calling me. Or don't.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.946
- Voicemail?
- Yep.

23:07.071 --> 23:09.388
- Did you talk to Sloan?
- Nope.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.374
Maybe you should call up another
girl, get your mind off her.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.353
I just had sex with Sloan two hours ago.
I'm not gonna call another girl.

23:14.642 --> 23:16.754
- Double-headers are the best.
- Yeah. Just shower.

23:16.879 --> 23:19.023
No, fuck that.
I wouldn't even brush my teeth.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.692
Just splash a little water on it.
You're good to go.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.092
I feel guilty, is all, all right?
I feel like I took advantage of Sloan.

23:24.217 --> 23:26.026
I'm not gonna call
another girl to hang out.

23:26.151 --> 23:28.963
Okay, guys, leave E alone.
He's gonna get sad

23:29.088 --> 23:31.065
- and then <i>none</i> of us get to go out.
- Thank you.

23:31.190 --> 23:34.292
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>
- Turtles, will you grab that for me?

23:36.361 --> 23:37.708
- ( Sighs ) It's Sloan.
- Oy.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.335
- It's fate.
- No, it's not fate. It's nauseating.

23:40.501 --> 23:41.754
- Answer it.
- And say what?

23:41.920 --> 23:42.611
Whatever you were gonna say.

23:42.736 --> 23:43.746
Tell her you want her back.

23:43.871 --> 23:45.180
Tell her thank you for the sex.

23:45.305 --> 23:48.583
- I'll do it, I'll do it.
- Give me the phone.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.284
- Hello?
- Hey.

23:50.409 --> 23:53.020
- <i>Hey.</i>
- I'm sorry.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.021
- Sorry for what?
- For leaving.

23:56.146 --> 23:58.256
That's okay.
I'm sorry too.

23:58.381 --> 24:01.826
- I hope I didn't confuse things.
- No, E, I'm not confused.

24:01.951 --> 24:04.595
- It's all good.
- I still feel bad though.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.721
I don't know. I feel like maybe I
should buy you dinner or something.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.947
<i>( Sloan laughs )
No.</i>

24:09.113 --> 24:12.560
Really. It was nice to,
um, see you again.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.830
( Choked ) I feel like
I needed some closure.

24:16.544 --> 24:17.402
Yeah.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.077
I wanted to tell you,
but we got distracted.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.752
Yeah.

24:22.499 --> 24:25.214
I quit my job because
I'm moving to New York.

24:26.373 --> 24:29.301
- Oh.
- But I'm happy.

24:30.159 --> 24:31.178
Well, that's good.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.764
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Good luck with that.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.850
Thank you.
Good luck here too, E.

24:37.016 --> 24:41.313
- Thanks.
- Okay. So maybe we will talk again soon.

24:41.879 --> 24:43.190
Yeah, I hope so.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.525
Bye.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.485
Bye.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.368
What happened?
Are you all right?

24:48.493 --> 24:51.795
Yeah. It's all good.
Sloan is moving to New York.

24:53.898 --> 24:55.940
Wow.

24:56.065 --> 24:57.908
Poor guy must fuck like dogshit.
