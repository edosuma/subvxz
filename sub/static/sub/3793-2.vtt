01:14.279 --> 01:16.074
Are we seriously
not going out tonight?

01:16.109 --> 01:18.560
- We seriously are not.
- Come on, vin.

01:18.595 --> 01:20.897
- We need to go find some girls.
- I got reading to do.

01:20.932 --> 01:22.924
You've been reading all day.
Look at your fingertips.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.118
They're all sunburned from
holding scripts over your face.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.957
Give me a break, Turtle.
There's still plenty to go.

01:26.992 --> 01:29.815
Sorry.
Drama!

01:29.850 --> 01:31.570
You want to go
find some ass?

01:35.468 --> 01:37.488
- Hi, jaq.
- Hey, Turtle.

01:37.523 --> 01:40.015
- Bye, Turtle.
- Bye, jaq.

01:40.221 --> 01:41.722
He's touchy.

01:46.531 --> 01:47.981
Sorry again.

01:48.016 --> 01:49.964
30 awful scripts to
get to one good one.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.621
- Yeah?
- It's strong.

01:51.656 --> 01:54.439
- Put it on the pile.
- Nice. I like the new work ethic, Vince.

01:54.474 --> 01:55.818
I don't.

01:56.422 --> 01:58.334
Oh, I do love those tits.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.918
You want to roll
to the villa tonight, E?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.837
Who, just me and you?

02:02.185 --> 02:03.541
Yeah, you're right.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.800
I'll just catch a beat.

02:07.455 --> 02:09.268
What?
Not out here.

02:12.255 --> 02:14.267
we're heading into
Ari's office right now.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.554
We'll be here for about 15
minutes then we'll go to lunch,

02:16.589 --> 02:18.835
probably urth caffe,
and then the gym.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.473
Sportsclub, not gold's,
cause I did my lats yesterday.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.184
I'll do a steam,
maybe a protein shake

02:24.219 --> 02:26.234
and then I'll race home
just in time to tuck you in.

02:26.269 --> 02:28.250
Don't you worry, babe.

02:28.841 --> 02:30.377
Oh, I Miss you.

02:32.393 --> 02:34.921
Okay.
Tweet.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.267
bye.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.531
What, do you tell her every
detail of your day, Drama?

02:38.566 --> 02:41.118
Yup. Jaqueline's
the real jealous type.

02:41.153 --> 02:43.181
So I got to make sure all
my time is accounted for,

02:43.216 --> 02:45.548
otherwise
it's nag nag nag.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.687
Sounds like
a good relationship.

02:48.415 --> 02:50.534
You've had
a relationship, Turtle?

02:51.024 --> 02:52.083
Look at this.

02:52.118 --> 02:53.604
Like the good old days, huh?

02:53.639 --> 02:55.465
Not quite.
I've read scripts.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.947
- a lot of scripts.
- You boys are maturing so nicely.

02:57.982 --> 02:59.433
- Lloyd.
- Thank you, Lloyd.

02:59.850 --> 03:01.881
So, Vinnie, I need to
formally apologize

03:01.916 --> 03:03.752
face to face for this
"danger beach" thing.

03:03.787 --> 03:05.352
- Ari, don't.
- I thought it was real.

03:05.387 --> 03:07.777
- We both did.
- I don't care about that.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.419
I'm here to move forward. I'll
do any one of these scripts.

03:12.299 --> 03:13.710
So he doesn't even have
to talk anymore?

03:13.745 --> 03:15.113
No, I'm gonna mime.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.690
Look at this.
What have we got?

03:17.725 --> 03:20.402
"jarvik," about the guy who
invented the artificial heart.

03:20.437 --> 03:22.514
I sent it to you
when you were in colombia.

03:22.549 --> 03:24.051
- Never heard back from you.
- We were working.

03:24.086 --> 03:25.524
So were they on
getting a lead actor.

03:25.559 --> 03:27.625
And they got one,
toby maguire.

03:28.057 --> 03:29.739
Leo's doing "the merchant
of venice beach."

03:29.774 --> 03:32.650
Wahlberg's doing "milk bar."
"nine brave souls"--

03:32.685 --> 03:34.207
Maser and baird.
I don't know what this is.

03:34.242 --> 03:35.981
- I've never heard of these guys.
- I found that one.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.076
Did you jerk it out
of Turtle's cock?

03:38.111 --> 03:40.191
Come on, Ari, it's cool.
Take a look.

03:43.469 --> 03:45.621
"dear Vincent Chase's
manager.

03:45.656 --> 03:48.112
After three years
of turmoil we have completed

03:48.147 --> 03:51.151
what we think you'll find to be
a complex and riveting tale of men

03:51.186 --> 03:54.587
on a journey to save
themselves from a literalo ??"

03:54.622 --> 03:56.362
jesus christ.

03:56.397 --> 03:58.882
Have we learned nothing
from our past mistakes?

03:58.917 --> 04:01.945
We need a go film here,
boys. A studio film.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.568
It's a great character piece.
It's about nine firefighters

04:04.603 --> 04:07.384
on the night before the biggest
fire they ever fought.

04:10.202 --> 04:12.291
No indies, E!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.973
Think of it like
the holocaust.

04:15.008 --> 04:17.045
Never again, all right?

04:17.079 --> 04:19.860
That is what got us here
in the first place.

04:19.894 --> 04:22.630
Vinnie, for the love of god,
this is not for us.

04:22.665 --> 04:24.418
All right,
well what is for us?

04:26.569 --> 04:29.324
- Right now there is nothing.
- Nothing?

04:29.359 --> 04:31.342
Nothing.
You're in movie jail.

04:31.377 --> 04:32.904
How do I get out?
What do I have to do?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.194
You just do what
you've been doing.

04:34.229 --> 04:36.969
- You just sit tight. You wait.
- Wait for what?

04:37.004 --> 04:40.492
- For the stench from "Medellin" to disappear.
- How long's that gonna take?

04:40.527 --> 04:42.766
How long did it take for the air
to clear from fucking chernobyl?

04:42.801 --> 04:44.959
What do you want us to do? You want
us to sit around and do nothing?

04:44.994 --> 04:47.039
I thought you weren't gonna
talk. But since you are, yes.

04:47.074 --> 04:48.710
You should sit around
and do nothing.

04:48.745 --> 04:50.960
Or maybe go to Vinnie's
supersecret hideaway in mexico

04:50.995 --> 04:54.080
and come back when you're tan
or tall, whichever comes first.

04:54.115 --> 04:56.387
- Ari.
- Vinnie, listen to me.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.889
Listen.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.481
We need to rebuild you.

05:01.516 --> 05:03.593
All right? We've got to
start over from scratch.

05:03.628 --> 05:05.412
I will decide when
the moment is right.

05:05.447 --> 05:08.979
And then we will pounce
on a greenlit studio picture

05:09.014 --> 05:12.146
with an a-list director,
'cause that is what we need.

05:12.181 --> 05:15.701
Listen, this is what I do.
Let me be heard this time.

05:15.736 --> 05:19.520
I swear to god you will
come back stronger than ever.

05:19.922 --> 05:21.426
Like lance armstrong,

05:21.461 --> 05:23.582
but with two balls.

05:26.324 --> 05:27.944
Hard to believe this
is where I'm at, huh?

05:27.979 --> 05:30.029
Hard to believe we're gonna sit
around on our asses and do nothing.

05:30.064 --> 05:33.465
There are other things an actor can do
besides waiting around for his agent.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.513
Like what, Drama? Somebody's
got to hire him to act.

05:35.548 --> 05:38.527
Nobody hired Drama when he was doing
those scenes on the 3rd street promenade.

05:38.562 --> 05:41.070
I didn't do scenes
on the promenade, jerkoff.

05:41.105 --> 05:43.197
The santa monica pier once,
and I got paid for that.

05:43.232 --> 05:44.552
So what do you think
I can do, Johnny?

05:44.672 --> 05:46.676
Well, you can work on
your body for one.

05:46.711 --> 05:48.259
My body? What's wrong with my body?

05:48.294 --> 05:49.823
Don't get sensitive, bro.

05:50.066 --> 05:53.106
Let's face it, you'd have a tough
time landing the lead in "300."

05:53.433 --> 05:54.521
What do you think
of this, Turtle?

05:54.556 --> 05:57.673
- I liked "300."
- You don't like my body either?

05:57.708 --> 05:59.032
Vin, your body is just fine.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.579
But I have often thought if we put
your face on russell crowe's body

06:02.614 --> 06:04.102
we'd have the terminator
of acting.

06:04.137 --> 06:06.700
You've thought about Vince's face on
russell crowe's body? That's disturbing.

06:06.735 --> 06:08.781
I'm actually feeling
insecure now.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.964
- I wanted to talk to you about that script.
- You heard Ari.

06:10.999 --> 06:13.346
We need a studio movie. We're
gonna listen to him this time.

06:13.381 --> 06:15.836
I'm talking about the writers. I'm
thinking maybe I should sign them.

06:15.871 --> 06:17.843
Yeah, give you three out-
Of-work clients to work with.

06:18.237 --> 06:20.297
Sorry, vin. I'm really just
making fun of his other clients.

06:20.332 --> 06:22.433
I actually think it's
a good idea. Worst case,

06:22.468 --> 06:25.072
- we'll have a nice management business to feed us.
- Exactly.

06:25.107 --> 06:28.267
Don't look now,
but it's justine chapin.

06:29.075 --> 06:31.492
Oh, maybe we can
get her to feed us.

06:32.598 --> 06:34.609
- Justine!
- Vince.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.889
hi!

06:35.924 --> 06:38.152
How have you been?
How's life?

06:38.187 --> 06:39.863
Life's amazing.
you?

06:40.863 --> 06:41.546
Sorry.

06:41.581 --> 06:43.289
God, you look incredible.

06:43.324 --> 06:44.752
You too.
What are you doing in town?

06:44.787 --> 06:46.530
Shooting a video
for my new album.

06:46.565 --> 06:48.671
New album.
That's awesome.

06:48.706 --> 06:50.660
- Can't wait to hear it.
- Don't make fun.

06:50.695 --> 06:53.730
I know my music isn't really your
thing. But this is way different.

06:53.765 --> 06:54.928
- It's very sophisticated.
- I'm sure.

06:54.963 --> 06:57.583
I've grown up. I'm doing
duets with tony bennett.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.195
- I love tony bennett.
- He's amazing.

07:00.335 --> 07:02.993
We're finishing the video
today and having a wrap party.

07:03.028 --> 07:05.289
- You guys should come.
- I got a girlfriend.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.715
You should come, Vince.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.118
Well, I'm off today,
so why not?

07:10.153 --> 07:11.896
Okay, I'll text you
the address.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.408
- Great.
- See you.

07:13.443 --> 07:15.647
- Yeah, bye.
- See you.

07:16.182 --> 07:18.334
Fuck the gym.
My body's fine.

07:20.102 --> 07:22.160
- Aw, fuck! What the--
- That's all right.

07:22.195 --> 07:24.240
What's the matter
with you today, buddy?

07:24.275 --> 07:25.656
Focus is off.

07:26.457 --> 07:28.196
What's the problem?
You got marital woes?

07:28.231 --> 07:30.170
No, client trouble.

07:30.205 --> 07:32.275
You need me to hunt down
some commissions for you?

07:32.310 --> 07:34.171
It's Vinnie Chase.
There are no commissions.

07:34.206 --> 07:34.963
Oh, man.

07:34.998 --> 07:38.440
Screened "Medellin" last night.
Fell asleep halfway through.

07:39.435 --> 07:41.708
Don't worry about Vinnie, Ari.
It's all good.

07:42.878 --> 07:45.475
I'm making so much money you're
gonna be all right, buddy.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.495
Jesus, come on.
That's a nice shot.

07:52.044 --> 07:52.967
I'm going again.

07:53.002 --> 07:56.201
Hit until you're happy.
It's your club.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.456
You know what? I love this
kid the way I love you.

08:00.491 --> 08:02.600
He comes into my office today,
he's got four scripts

08:02.635 --> 08:04.107
that he wants to do,
none of which he can get.

08:04.142 --> 08:05.682
I don't know what
to say to him.

08:05.717 --> 08:07.075
You were always good
at lying off the cuff.

08:07.110 --> 08:08.651
What are you talking about?
I never lied to you.

08:08.686 --> 08:10.653
What about when you told me you
liked "the truth about charlie"?

08:10.688 --> 08:13.212
- What is "the truth about charlie"?
- Exactly.

08:13.247 --> 08:15.412
- Hit E ball, please.
- Look where we are now, baby.

08:15.447 --> 08:17.876
What about Vinnie?
Think he's gonna be all right?

08:19.226 --> 08:20.866
50-50.

08:23.856 --> 08:25.578
Fucking rusty cunt bucket!

08:25.613 --> 08:27.105
- Fuck!
- I wasn't laughing.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.618
Fuck!

08:32.354 --> 08:34.499
Bullets and bitches,
l.b. Here.

08:34.534 --> 08:35.857
I'm looking for
nick or lawrence.

08:35.893 --> 08:38.866
L.b. Stands for lawrence,
hot dog. Is there a problem?

08:38.902 --> 08:42.054
No, my name is Eric murphy. I'm
a talent manager from los angeles.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.424
I represent Vincent Chase.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.752
You guys sent me your script.
I'd love to talk to you about it.

08:45.787 --> 08:48.596
Please don't tell me this is one of
them prank shows. We got guns here.

08:48.631 --> 08:50.451
No prank, l.b.
I loved your script.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.045
Holy fuck!
I'm freakin'!

08:52.080 --> 08:55.022
I'm fuh-fuckin' freakin'.
Are you serious?

08:55.057 --> 08:57.557
Oh, damn. Vincent Chase
wants to do our movie.

08:57.592 --> 09:00.929
No, actually I wanted to talk
to you guys about representation.

09:01.468 --> 09:03.966
I'd better get nick.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.179
Look, how about I come out
there and see you guys?

09:06.214 --> 09:07.491
All right.
Yeah, I guess.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.354
I guess
that'd be all right.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.626
How do you know she's not
a virgin anymore, Turtle?

09:12.661 --> 09:15.241
It's been all over the papers. Why do you
think her last few albums haven't sold?

09:15.276 --> 09:16.633
I should not
be here right now.

09:16.668 --> 09:18.800
You know I had a thing for
this girl back in the day.

09:18.835 --> 09:21.576
- But you never closed.
- I wasn't gonna be her first.

09:21.611 --> 09:24.034
I know your motto, never be
the first, never be the last.

09:24.069 --> 09:25.298
Could you guys
just take me home?

09:25.333 --> 09:26.195
- No.
- Shut up.

09:26.202 --> 09:28.944
- Maybe I'll call a cab.
- What is the problem?

09:28.979 --> 09:31.305
The problem is when I gave
jaq my itinerary

09:31.340 --> 09:34.121
I didn't account on time
being spent with non-virgins.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.682
It's almost 10:00 in france.
I'm supposed to be home

09:36.717 --> 09:38.310
so I can tuck her in
on the computer.

09:38.601 --> 09:39.877
If not, she's gonna freak.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.034
Johnny, why do you want to be in a
relationship with someone this crazy?

09:43.069 --> 09:45.899
Obsession is a huge
turn on to me, bro.

10:10.578 --> 10:12.771
You are so gonna
bang this girl.

10:12.806 --> 10:15.640
She can be real trouble
for me, I'm telling you.

10:15.675 --> 10:18.422
If you and Drama both have
girlfriends, I'm gonna shoot myself.

10:18.457 --> 10:20.758
I hope I have a girlfriend
after tonight.

10:21.201 --> 10:22.781
I'm gonna go call her.

10:37.786 --> 10:39.481
- Hello.
- Hey, babe.

10:39.791 --> 10:43.042
Hello, Johnny.
Are you ready to video?

10:43.077 --> 10:45.306
No, my stupid
internet's down.

10:45.341 --> 10:47.065
Modern technology sucks.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.514
Did you try
resetting the modem?

10:48.549 --> 10:51.312
Yeah, like three times.
No go.

10:51.347 --> 10:53.543
I'm sorry if I let you
down tonight.

10:53.578 --> 10:55.119
You didn't let me down.

10:55.604 --> 10:57.943
But I do like to see you.

10:57.978 --> 11:00.006
I like to see
you too, baby.

11:00.546 --> 11:02.606
Are you listening
to tony bennett?

11:03.406 --> 11:05.830
Uh, yeah.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.020
I was just playing some cds.

11:08.055 --> 11:09.887
I love tony bennett.

11:09.922 --> 11:11.687
Oh yeah?
So do I.

11:11.722 --> 11:13.323
I didn't know you
loved tony bennett.

11:13.358 --> 11:17.216
I guess we still have some things
left to uncover about each other, huh?

11:18.964 --> 11:22.035
Yeah, I guess so.

11:37.811 --> 11:39.772
So let me try to
understand something.

11:39.807 --> 11:42.708
You represent Vincent Chase,
you want to represent us,

11:42.743 --> 11:46.492
we want Vincent Chase but you
can't get us Vincent Chase.

11:46.527 --> 11:48.946
- Well, Vince is looking to do a studio movie right now.
- Oh, he is?

11:48.981 --> 11:52.153
- So what can you get us?
- I think I can get you a job writing.

11:52.188 --> 11:55.544
Why do we need a job when we spent three
years of our lives writing the script?

11:55.579 --> 11:57.242
Well, maybe if it's
a real writing job--

11:57.277 --> 11:59.220
Yeah, l.b., wait.
Hold on for a second.

11:59.255 --> 12:00.895
L.b. Gets a little excited
by the appearance

12:00.930 --> 12:02.854
of a fancy car and nice
clothes. No offense.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.382
This script has our life's
blood dripped into it.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.029
As your manager, nick--

12:07.064 --> 12:09.662
As the manager
of Vincent Chase

12:09.697 --> 12:11.237
who can't get us
Vincent Chase,

12:11.272 --> 12:13.612
who do you manage
that you can get for us?

12:13.647 --> 12:15.652
You got shia labeouf?

12:15.687 --> 12:19.772
Listen, managers don't necessarily
get you stars for your movies, nick.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.411
What I can do,
what I will do,

12:21.428 --> 12:23.301
is passionately sell you
guys to the town

12:23.336 --> 12:25.661
so that people will
pay you lots of money

12:25.696 --> 12:27.677
to do what you did
so well on this script.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.711
I mean, let me do that.
Come on, guys.

12:29.746 --> 12:32.350
What do I have to do to prove to you that
I'm the one that can change your lives?

12:32.385 --> 12:35.477
Sell the script--
"nine brave souls."

12:35.512 --> 12:37.376
That's what you can do.

12:50.890 --> 12:53.913
- Just calm down.
- I can't calm down, Turtle.

12:54.069 --> 12:55.441
I never should have
lied to her.

12:55.476 --> 12:57.704
Jaq knows me too well.

12:57.739 --> 12:59.684
It's like the tone of my voice
is her own truth serum.

12:59.719 --> 13:02.720
Drama, you're not doing anything
wrong so stop worrying about it.

13:02.755 --> 13:05.880
I appreciate the advice, Turtle,
but you don't understand crazy broads

13:05.915 --> 13:09.210
'cause nobody's ever been attracted
enough to you to act psycho.

13:11.019 --> 13:14.166
I'm gonna call her back and
try and gauge her temperature.

13:14.475 --> 13:15.910
Good luck with that.

13:15.945 --> 13:18.294
You guys have
an amazing chemistry.

13:18.329 --> 13:21.324
Wow, this is like a mutual
admiration society.

13:21.674 --> 13:23.580
- Loved "aquaman."
- Thank you.

13:23.615 --> 13:26.059
I haven't got a chance
to see the suel yet.

13:26.094 --> 13:28.123
Don't worry, I'm not in it.
Jake gyllenhaal is.

13:28.158 --> 13:29.779
Well, I guess
you had your reasons.

13:29.814 --> 13:32.161
Anyway, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

13:32.196 --> 13:33.689
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

13:33.724 --> 13:36.291
And, sweetheart,
I'll see you in a bit.

13:36.326 --> 13:37.635
Okay.

13:39.363 --> 13:41.774
- Isn't he awesome?
- Yeah, he is.

13:41.809 --> 13:44.128
- I have someone else I would like you to meet.
- Oh yeah?

13:44.163 --> 13:46.744
Yes. See the pink dress over
there with the incredible legs?

13:46.779 --> 13:50.327
- Yeah.
- She's so in love with you  and she's amazing.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.582
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:51.617 --> 13:53.880
I'm gonna go get her.
Be right back.

13:56.652 --> 13:59.592
I'm not sure, but I think
I'm being pawned off.

13:59.627 --> 14:02.535
- Get out of here.
- Something very off about today.

14:02.570 --> 14:05.223
She's not answering. I'm
freaking out. She must be pissed.

14:05.258 --> 14:06.602
She must be sleeping.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.845
I just talked to her
10 minutes ago Turtle.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.103
Baby jaq don't
fall asleep that fast.

14:11.138 --> 14:13.513
Maybe she's on the can
taking a shit.

14:14.711 --> 14:16.574
Yeah, let's hope so.

14:16.609 --> 14:18.533
I'll call her back in 10.

14:19.841 --> 14:22.371
Vince, michella.
Michella, Vince.

14:22.406 --> 14:25.035
- Hay.
- Hi.

14:26.617 --> 14:30.469
So, justine, you have any other
spare friends lying around for me?

14:35.119 --> 14:36.560
E's on the phone.

14:37.024 --> 14:38.326
why?

14:38.361 --> 14:40.859
I don't know,
but he sounds enthusiastic.

14:42.957 --> 14:45.319
- What?
- Jesus, be less friendly.

14:45.354 --> 14:47.736
If you have business
to discuss, start talking, E.

14:47.771 --> 14:49.454
I want to talk to you about
that script I found.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.574
What did I tell you
this morning?

14:50.609 --> 14:52.922
Relax, Ari.
I'm not calling about Vince.

14:52.957 --> 14:55.062
- I want to sign the writers.
- Why would I care?

14:55.097 --> 14:57.685
Because I want to sell their script.
I need an agent to help me do that.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.796
Try the yellow pages.

14:59.831 --> 15:02.317
Come on, Ari. I'm calling
you as a friend, all right?

15:02.352 --> 15:05.476
I need your help. It's a really
good script. Can you help me?

15:05.511 --> 15:07.451
Yes I can, E.
Lloyd.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.555
Get the number
for ucla extension

15:09.590 --> 15:13.001
so Eric can take a course to finally
learn how the movie business works.

15:13.036 --> 15:15.745
- You won't help me, Ari?
- We share one client, E.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.100
We're never gonna
share two.

15:20.527 --> 15:21.673
Here you go.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.361
So how long have you
been a dancer?

15:24.683 --> 15:27.319
Since I was three.
So like 19 years.

15:27.354 --> 15:29.055
I thought you said
you were 27.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.382
so?

15:31.412 --> 15:33.201
Still no answer.
I don't know what to do.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.376
- Keep trying.
- Who's not answering?

15:36.055 --> 15:37.601
My girlfriend.
She's pissed at me.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.831
- Why, what did you do?
- I lied to her.

15:39.866 --> 15:41.759
I said I was home
when I was at a party.

15:41.794 --> 15:44.390
But she has no way
of knowing that he lied.

15:44.425 --> 15:46.476
But it's night in paris
and she's not answering

15:46.511 --> 15:48.156
her phone
so he's freaking out.

15:48.191 --> 15:49.675
This is unreal.
And it's her fault.

15:49.710 --> 15:52.409
Because if she wasn't so fucking
possessive I wouldn't have to lie to her.

15:52.444 --> 15:54.497
- Maybe she's sleeping.
- That's what I said.

15:54.532 --> 15:56.944
Well, you're both wrong 'cause
the ring would have woke her up.

15:56.979 --> 15:59.103
So either she's pissed
and not answering

15:59.138 --> 16:00.769
or she's being held captive.

16:00.804 --> 16:02.184
There's a third choice.

16:02.219 --> 16:04.360
- What's that?
- She's out.

16:04.395 --> 16:07.807
- Out where?
- Maybe a party. You are.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.423
You think my girl
would lie to me?

16:09.458 --> 16:12.322
I told my boyfriend I was
at an audition today.

16:12.357 --> 16:14.432
He gets really upset
when I'm out.

16:14.980 --> 16:16.967
I'm calling her back.

16:19.203 --> 16:21.583
So with all that dancing,

16:21.618 --> 16:24.525
can you do any crazy shit like
put your legs behind you head?

16:24.560 --> 16:26.430
I told you
I have a boyfriend.

16:26.465 --> 16:29.186
You did. But you also
said you lie to him.

16:29.221 --> 16:32.405
So maybe you could tell him
that we didn't fuck today.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.407
Baby, it's me again.

16:40.182 --> 16:41.661
I'd like to think
you're sleeping,

16:41.696 --> 16:43.773
but nobody could
sleep through this.

16:43.808 --> 16:45.783
Where the fuck are you?!

16:45.818 --> 16:47.878
Pick up the fucking phone!

16:47.913 --> 16:50.823
Didn't his mother ever tell
him not to speak like that?

16:52.538 --> 16:54.845
I remember the first time
you and justine went out.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.493
- I was still living in ohio and I was so jealous.
- Oh yeah?

16:57.920 --> 17:00.618
I've had a crush on you since
you did that mentos commercial.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.162
Oh, wow, that was
a long time ago, huh?

17:03.197 --> 17:04.692
I should get
some extra credit

17:04.727 --> 17:07.083
for liking you even before
you were a giant movie star.

17:07.117 --> 17:08.607
Yes, you should.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.803
Uh, listen, michelle,

17:12.838 --> 17:14.165
would you excuse me
for a second?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.463
I just have to make
a quick phone call.

17:15.498 --> 17:17.861
- Yeah, sure. But, Vince.
- Yeah?

17:17.896 --> 17:19.567
- It's michella.
- Oh.

17:19.602 --> 17:22.107
But you can call me michelle
if you like that better.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.939
I'll be right back.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.693
Hey, Lloyd, is Ari there?
I need to talk to him.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.988
Ari's in a screening right now.
Is everything okay?

17:31.023 --> 17:34.406
Actually, no it's not.
Can you get him out?

17:34.441 --> 17:37.773
Tell him I'll be there in 10
minutes. I really need to talk.

17:54.108 --> 17:55.725
Vince is gonna be here
in 10 minutes.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.013
Jesus!

17:57.048 --> 17:58.964
What do you want to do?

17:59.615 --> 18:03.298
I can't walk out of here 'cause the
director is sitting right behind me.

18:04.032 --> 18:05.396
So what should I do?

18:09.691 --> 18:12.271
Pull the plug
on the projector.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.469
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go.

18:25.799 --> 18:27.699
What the hell?

18:27.734 --> 18:31.329
Can we fix this fucking
projector already?

18:31.364 --> 18:32.989
I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.757
I'm gonna hit
the bathroom real quick.

18:34.792 --> 18:38.477
Could someone fix
the fucking projector?

18:38.512 --> 18:40.675
- So what did he say the problem is?
- He didn't.

18:40.710 --> 18:43.278
But if I had to guess I'd say you
didn't make him very happy this morning.

18:43.313 --> 18:45.334
Like it's my fault.

18:50.444 --> 18:52.827
- You calling to apologize?
- I'm calling to tell you

18:52.862 --> 18:55.411
that I blame you for every bad
thing that's ever happened to Vince,

18:55.446 --> 18:58.586
and every bad thing that ever could
happen to him for the rest of his life.

18:58.621 --> 19:01.226
You're the unfucking
lucky charm. You hear me?

19:01.261 --> 19:03.799
You should never utter the
words "I've found a good script"

19:03.834 --> 19:06.080
'cause you have no idea what a
good fucking script looks like.

19:06.115 --> 19:07.386
Live with that.

19:09.873 --> 19:12.763
Mr. Murphy,
miss daniels will see you now.

19:15.878 --> 19:16.957
Thank you.

19:19.316 --> 19:21.980
Well, this is a surprise.

19:23.239 --> 19:24.620
How could you
do this to me?

19:24.655 --> 19:27.006
Six months I've been
nothing but faithful.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.528
Do you have any idea how much
pussy is thrown at me day and night?

19:30.563 --> 19:33.509
And I pass on all of it.
For what?

19:33.544 --> 19:35.359
So you could run around
fucking every french faggot

19:35.394 --> 19:36.591
that pays you a compliment?

19:36.626 --> 19:38.730
- Johnny?
- Baby?

19:39.197 --> 19:40.508
Where the fuck
have you been?

19:40.543 --> 19:43.892
I was at the hospital.
My friend had a car accident.

19:43.927 --> 19:45.930
- What friend?
- Lily.

19:45.965 --> 19:47.370
Hi, Johnny.

19:48.251 --> 19:50.027
Oh, hey, lily.

19:50.062 --> 19:52.818
- How are you doing?
- I've been better. You?

19:52.853 --> 19:54.264
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

19:55.089 --> 19:56.847
Jaq, are you okay?

19:57.583 --> 19:59.825
No, Johnny,
I'm not okay.

19:59.860 --> 20:02.022
I knew you were a little
crazy when you said

20:02.057 --> 20:04.917
we needed to get on
the computer every night,

20:04.952 --> 20:07.797
but I had to call the police
on my last boyfriend.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.357
- Look, baby-- - I don't want to
have  to call the police on you.

20:10.392 --> 20:12.164
- Goodbye, Johnny.
- Wait wait wait wait!

20:12.199 --> 20:14.041
Wait, jaq!
jaq!

20:15.761 --> 20:16.957
Baby.

20:21.743 --> 20:23.601
So why aren't you keeping
this for Vince?

20:23.636 --> 20:25.944
Ari only wants Vince
to do a go studio movie.

20:25.979 --> 20:27.687
- Do you agree?
- Yeah.

20:27.722 --> 20:29.760
I mean, if he can get one.
What do you think?

20:29.795 --> 20:32.631
I think we don't work
together anymore, Eric.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.862
But if this script is
as good as you say it is

20:34.897 --> 20:36.519
seems like Vince
could use it.

20:36.554 --> 20:40.660
On the other hand, you are one more
bad choice away from ruining his career.

20:40.976 --> 20:42.115
Thanks.

20:42.150 --> 20:43.795
So did Ari read it?

20:43.830 --> 20:45.168
Nope.

20:45.715 --> 20:47.038
So what makes you
think I will?

20:47.073 --> 20:48.805
You have a better work ethic.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.053
Look at that.
See? You almost smiled.

20:51.936 --> 20:53.429
Now look,
it's really good.

20:53.464 --> 20:55.518
I promise you I wouldn't waste
your time if it wasn't.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.289
Just read 10 pages of it and
you'll be hooked, guaranteed.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.617
- Please.
- Leave it, I'll read five.

21:11.361 --> 21:13.574
He's here. He's here.
Vince is here.

21:13.609 --> 21:15.612
What, are you speedballing
fairy dust?

21:15.647 --> 21:17.863
Go out there
and greet him like a man.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.457
Vinnie. There he is.
How you doing, baby?

21:23.492 --> 21:26.255
To be honest, Ari,
not great.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.793
I haven't said that
very many times in my life.

21:28.828 --> 21:30.712
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.824
I came back from mexico
motivated, ready to work

21:33.859 --> 21:36.971
and correct me if I'm wrong,
you basically said that I can't.

21:37.006 --> 21:39.607
- No no no, what I said was--
- I know what you said.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.615
I just want to know
what it means.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.330
Do you really have
a plan, Ari? Really?

21:44.365 --> 21:46.929
You always said you were going to be the
guy to give it to me straight, so come on.

21:46.964 --> 21:49.495
Give it to me straight.
Am I gonna be okay?

21:50.428 --> 21:51.947
I don't know.

21:53.716 --> 21:56.992
I mean, one bad movie
and this is what happens?

21:57.796 --> 21:59.492
I mean, was I really
that awful?

22:00.894 --> 22:02.360
Straight up, Vinnie,
the movie was awful.

22:03.397 --> 22:04.973
And yes,
you were awful in it.

22:05.008 --> 22:07.555
But you know what?
One bad movie can be overcome.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.036
Look at colin farrell.
He's overcome dozens of them

22:10.071 --> 22:13.046
because the perception of him
is he's a movie star.

22:13.081 --> 22:16.213
- And what's the perception of me?
- That you don't give a fuck.

22:16.565 --> 22:19.516
You refuse to play the game. You
refuse to be a part of the process.

22:19.551 --> 22:21.971
Look, the great ones,
even if they don't care,

22:22.006 --> 22:23.835
they pretend they do.

22:26.703 --> 22:28.534
Do you think
I'm a good actor, Ari?

22:29.438 --> 22:32.463
I did not sign you in the first
place 'cause I thought you could act.

22:32.498 --> 22:34.967
I signed you because I thought
you were a movie star.

22:35.002 --> 22:38.906
And you haven't acted
like one in a long time.

22:39.404 --> 22:41.414
I'm ready to play
the game, Ari.

22:41.449 --> 22:42.695
Whatever you say.

22:42.730 --> 22:44.823
- That's a good start.
- But I'm not willing to wait.

22:45.211 --> 22:47.189
I want you to send me
in to every person

22:47.224 --> 22:48.533
in this town who's
willing to meet me.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.964
I don't care
if it wastes my time,

22:49.999 --> 22:52.356
I will charm the fuck
out of every last one of them.

22:52.391 --> 22:54.163
Filmmakers,
studio execs

22:54.198 --> 22:56.170
all of them,
I will change the perception.

22:56.186 --> 22:57.682
I like the fire.

23:04.477 --> 23:06.549
You don't believe
I'm a good actor?

23:06.942 --> 23:08.633
It remains to be seen.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.091
But, vin, I'm starting
to believe

23:11.126 --> 23:12.907
that you're
a movie star again.

23:12.942 --> 23:14.179
And you know what?

23:14.654 --> 23:16.729
This town loves a comeback.

23:16.764 --> 23:18.296
And since britney
fucked hers up,

23:18.331 --> 23:20.080
it's all you!

23:24.612 --> 23:25.880
Thanks, bud.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.203
hey, Vinnie, over here.

23:31.354 --> 23:33.705
- Yo, vin, we're leaving.
- Give me two minutes.

23:33.740 --> 23:34.937
I'll be right back.

23:39.504 --> 23:40.869
Where did you go?
I've been waiting.

23:40.904 --> 23:42.691
I'm sorry i'll be right back.

23:45.927 --> 23:47.622
Excuse me. Can I talk
to you for a second?

23:47.657 --> 23:49.637
- Where are you going?
- Vince, what?

23:50.517 --> 23:53.603
Why did you invite me here if you were
just going to pawn me off on your friend?

23:53.638 --> 23:55.924
- I thought you'd like her.
- I like you.

23:57.010 --> 23:59.509
Vince, if I fuck you

23:59.544 --> 24:01.660
then I'll want to be
your girlfriend.

24:01.695 --> 24:03.611
And I don't want to be in
a relationship right now.

24:03.646 --> 24:06.173
So last time I saw you, you were
too innocent. Now you're too slutty?

24:06.208 --> 24:08.520
- Now I'm having fun.
- So we'll have fun.

24:08.916 --> 24:11.306
Keep it casual.
Get serious in the future.

24:11.341 --> 24:13.282
And if we fuck up any chance
of having a future?

24:13.802 --> 24:15.481
I'll risk it if you will.

24:17.521 --> 24:19.356
How long are we just gonna
sit here for?

24:19.391 --> 24:20.811
Till Vince comes out.

24:20.846 --> 24:22.814
Well, I'm getting
really bored

24:22.849 --> 24:25.061
and it's giving me
time to think.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.644
It's not a good thing
for you.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.951
I understand. And try not
to take this as an insult,

24:29.986 --> 24:33.225
but as gorgeous as you are,
I'd never ditch Vince for you.

24:33.752 --> 24:36.188
Well, I like your loyalty.

24:36.223 --> 24:38.091
Yeah?
How much?

24:40.838 --> 24:43.461
Jesus christ, Drama.
Where the hell have you been?

24:44.879 --> 24:46.338
I've been drinking.

24:47.047 --> 24:48.331
You okay?

24:51.282 --> 24:52.994
Do I look okay?

24:54.270 --> 24:57.681
- There's Vince.
- Well, look at this.

25:00.914 --> 25:02.127
Let's roll.

25:03.842 --> 25:05.910
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.

25:10.281 --> 25:12.860
You guys really kind of
like each other, huh?

25:12.895 --> 25:14.878
Uh, maybe.

25:15.518 --> 25:17.381
That's great.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.909
That's just fucking great.
