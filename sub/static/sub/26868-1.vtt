00:35.500 --> 00:37.589
- For
generations, people have been

00:37.999 --> 00:41.306
searching for the
answer to the afterlife.

00:44.092 --> 00:48.574
Now, one man alone,
with all the know-how

00:48.618 --> 00:50.489
takes on this struggle.

01:07.463 --> 01:11.293
No longer is he trying
to study the paranormal.

01:13.556 --> 01:14.992
Now, he battles it.

01:18.779 --> 01:22.434
Sometimes, ghosts need
to be taught a lesson.

01:39.887 --> 01:41.540
- Oh hi, my name is Vincent,

01:41.584 --> 01:44.892
I'm your favorite TV
host, AKA Ghost Angler.

01:44.935 --> 01:46.719
I'll be here, investigating.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.501
- They're coming.

02:33.941 --> 02:36.465
I've been doing this
for quite some time.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.557
It all started when I got
sucked into their world.

02:43.951 --> 02:46.997
I got tired of
fighting, made a deal.

02:50.958 --> 02:51.915
I'm out.

02:53.395 --> 02:55.440
Now they're following me.

03:14.024 --> 03:14.895
- Ah, hell.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.814
You kids ready to see a hero?

04:37.934 --> 04:40.023
- That was meant for you.

05:31.292 --> 05:32.858
- Excuse me, sir?

05:33.859 --> 05:35.035
Sir, excuse me.

05:36.906 --> 05:38.734
Sir can you listen
to me for a second?

05:40.692 --> 05:42.564
Are you, sir are
you ignoring me?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.829
Sir will you just take a
look at these real fast?

06:01.844 --> 06:04.325
But sir, it's just one stack.

06:04.368 --> 06:08.111
- It's just one stack you
bring around here every month.

06:08.155 --> 06:11.593
Do you know how many of
those I burn every month?

06:26.999 --> 06:28.262
- You burn these?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.308
Sir, I'm trying
to find my sister

06:31.352 --> 06:33.180
whose been lost for two years.

06:34.746 --> 06:36.879
And you got the balls to
just go and burn my flyers?

06:36.922 --> 06:38.228
- They're put to better use than

06:38.272 --> 06:41.188
them there shorts you got on.

06:41.231 --> 06:42.885
Pockets go below the bottom.

06:44.365 --> 06:47.368
- Who gives a shit
about my clothes?

06:47.411 --> 06:51.328
I'm talking about a lost
person, a human life.

06:54.201 --> 06:56.464
- She lost around here, well.

07:00.032 --> 07:00.859
She dead.

- John.

11:20.249 --> 11:21.772
You told me this
is a convention.

11:24.079 --> 11:26.603
No, no.

11:26.647 --> 11:28.910
This is rock bottom.

11:31.086 --> 11:32.870
Make the best of this?

11:32.914 --> 11:36.439
This is my career being flushed
down the fucking toilet.

11:36.483 --> 11:40.965
There are three people here
with combined four good teeth!

11:41.009 --> 11:44.142
Does this sound like they have
five dollars for a headshot?

11:44.186 --> 11:46.101
They can barely afford
their toothpaste.

11:51.933 --> 11:55.066
We are at a very drastic
crossroad right now.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.723
Either I'm throwing in the
towel and quitting the business,

11:59.767 --> 12:01.595
or I'm finding a new agent.

12:02.552 --> 12:03.466
Fix this John!

12:03.510 --> 12:05.250
Fix this or I will.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.560
You can hang up the
phone right now.

12:44.855 --> 12:49.469
Sir, would you like a headshot
from a television host?

12:52.036 --> 12:56.650
- Yeah, when does
the show start?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.738
- Start?

12:57.781 --> 13:00.001
Now, here, it's
happening right now.

13:00.044 --> 13:00.784
- Really?

13:03.657 --> 13:04.745
This is your headshot?

13:06.094 --> 13:10.664
- Oh my God yeah.

13:12.187 --> 13:12.970
- Oh.

13:13.014 --> 13:13.797
Oh, really?

13:15.669 --> 13:17.584
Sorry, I got another
show to get to, sorry.

13:19.890 --> 13:20.717
- Who are these people?

13:20.761 --> 13:21.501
Where am I?

13:23.459 --> 13:24.939
What is this place?

14:10.158 --> 14:14.510
- Who do you think has final
say in putting in a fountain?

14:14.554 --> 14:17.687
Is there really even
a use for a fountain?

14:17.731 --> 14:18.775
- I don't care.

14:28.393 --> 14:30.787
- Do you have to get
like this every time?

14:33.050 --> 14:36.488
First, that lasts for a day.

14:36.532 --> 14:39.317
And then, in comes the moping.

14:45.149 --> 14:48.762
This has become like,
a routine for you.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.764
It's, it's every month.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.939
Rinse and repeat.

14:51.982 --> 14:53.462
- Isn't this all getting to you?

14:53.505 --> 14:56.291
Doing the same thing
over and over again?

14:56.334 --> 14:57.118
- Yes.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.121
And you're just feeling it now?

15:01.122 --> 15:03.777
Of course this is getting to me.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.474
But unlike you, I'm not gonna go

15:05.517 --> 15:07.389
flaunting it to the
whole entire town.

15:09.696 --> 15:11.611
Is that what you want?

15:16.746 --> 15:17.921
- No, not good enough.

15:18.966 --> 15:20.141
You can't do sad face.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.840
- Well I'll get
your snot bubbles,

15:23.884 --> 15:26.626
and your ugly crying,
and your puffy eyes, and.

15:26.669 --> 15:28.236
- Hey look, Ghost Angler.

15:30.586 --> 15:34.590
- Okay, so you
want his autograph?

15:36.113 --> 15:40.161
I mean, you didn't really
bring anything for him to sign.

15:41.684 --> 15:43.991
I guess you could do cleavage,
but personal experience

15:44.034 --> 15:46.428
two showers in it washes
right off your skin.

15:48.865 --> 15:49.649
Did that rhyme?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.129
- Yeah, you're gonna
have to stop that,

15:52.173 --> 15:53.261
or we can't be friends.

15:54.523 --> 15:55.829
- It's nice to know
that our friendship

15:55.872 --> 15:58.701
stands on the delicate
balance of sentence structure.

15:58.745 --> 16:00.485
- You need
to know your place.

16:00.529 --> 16:01.791
- Mmhm.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.793
- But no, I don't need
him to sign my body.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.316
On the show he was a medium.

16:07.275 --> 16:10.017
- Okay, and I'm supposed
to know what that is?

16:10.060 --> 16:11.975
- He feels things.

16:13.890 --> 16:14.891
- Uh huh.

16:15.979 --> 16:17.546
Well I feel things too.

16:17.589 --> 16:18.939
Let's go get an autograph.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.825
- Oh my God, not again.

16:35.869 --> 16:36.870
Not again.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.451
Some spirits need to
be taught a lesson.

16:53.495 --> 16:54.888
Well, I'm teaching you one.

16:56.498 --> 16:59.240
Ghost Angler, what is that?

16:59.283 --> 17:01.242
What does that even mean?

17:04.114 --> 17:05.898
What did you get me?

17:09.163 --> 17:10.468
Two dollars?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.906
What am I gonna
do, go buy tacos?

17:16.605 --> 17:18.781
I don't need this.

17:18.825 --> 17:21.915
I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna go find John.

18:03.826 --> 18:05.567
- Excuse me?

18:05.610 --> 18:06.394
- Hi!

18:09.005 --> 18:10.790
- Are you from the
show Ghost Angler?

18:12.922 --> 18:14.315
- Yes, I am.

18:14.358 --> 18:15.751
Do you watch the show?

18:19.842 --> 18:21.801
- Yeah, religiously.

18:22.845 --> 18:23.890
- Oh good, good.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.195
- No, no.

18:26.588 --> 18:28.372
My sister did, I
watched it with her.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.985
- Well that's okay.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.900
Would you like a headshot?

18:33.943 --> 18:35.031
It's always nice to meet a fan,

18:35.075 --> 18:36.946
even if it's just a half of one.

18:39.296 --> 18:41.559
- May I ask you a question?

18:46.608 --> 18:48.436
- As long as you don't
hold up the line, you can.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.922
Sorry, that was a
poor attempt at humor.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.706
Go ahead, ask away.

18:57.749 --> 19:00.100
- Is your show real,
or is it a scam?

19:00.143 --> 19:01.492
- I assure you it's real.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.974
Maybe it's embellished a
little bit through editing,

19:05.018 --> 19:08.064
but the places and
experiences are all real.

19:08.108 --> 19:09.544
- Are you really a medium?

19:11.285 --> 19:15.332
- Child of the paranormal,
dictator of the undead,

19:15.376 --> 19:17.857
the unfollower of dark arts.

19:20.598 --> 19:22.296
- Yeah, right.

19:22.339 --> 19:26.735
Do you think you can
maybe read the past

19:26.778 --> 19:28.868
and point someone in
the right direction?

19:30.347 --> 19:33.873
- I've been able to do amazing
things, since my youth.

19:35.483 --> 19:38.138
It all happened when I lived
in a pinewood tree house.

19:38.181 --> 19:40.227
My parents, a traveling
band of gypsies.

19:40.270 --> 19:43.404
- Yeah, okay can you like
use your super powers to help

19:43.447 --> 19:46.059
us find her sister who's
been missing for two years?

19:48.888 --> 19:49.801
What?

19:49.845 --> 19:50.977
When were you going to ask?

19:54.850 --> 19:57.984
- Well, I haven't done that
sort of thing for quite a while.

19:58.027 --> 20:02.249
You see I'm at a very big, big
convention center right now,

20:02.292 --> 20:04.816
that's gonna start any time now.

20:04.860 --> 20:06.949
So I can't just up and leave.

20:11.998 --> 20:13.782
- Thank you for your time.

20:13.825 --> 20:15.001
- You're welcome.

20:15.044 --> 20:16.132
- Sorry to bother you.

20:24.619 --> 20:25.402
- Listen buddy.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.928
I can pay you, okay.

20:28.971 --> 20:31.060
It's been two years.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.062
That girl is the only
one who's been searching

20:33.106 --> 20:35.369
for her sister since
she's disappeared.

20:35.412 --> 20:36.979
Okay, she needs closure.

20:37.023 --> 20:40.069
Just make something
up for all I care.

20:40.113 --> 20:40.896
She needs this.

20:45.422 --> 20:46.206
- You can pay?

20:53.256 --> 20:55.432
Thank you very much.

20:55.476 --> 20:58.131
- If you need anything
else, just let me know.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.088
- I sure will.

21:09.490 --> 21:10.273
Hey.

21:14.451 --> 21:16.149
- Dude.

21:16.192 --> 21:16.976
- What?

21:18.020 --> 21:19.152
- Where's my drink?

21:20.675 --> 21:21.676
- Sorry.

21:23.895 --> 21:25.114
Do you miss her?

21:31.381 --> 21:32.165
- Yeah.

21:36.256 --> 21:40.695
The funny thing is, we weren't
even really that close.

21:44.090 --> 21:46.266
We never had anything in common.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.054
- Then what keeps you going?

22:01.063 --> 22:04.153
- The want to actually
have a sister.

22:06.460 --> 22:09.463
To gossip, to bicker, to fight.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.075
You never know how
much these things mean

22:13.119 --> 22:16.209
until you don't
have them anymore.

22:21.301 --> 22:23.868
- So how did she go missing?

22:25.305 --> 22:26.393
- Isn't that your job?

22:30.919 --> 22:33.748
- Okay, I don't like you.

22:34.749 --> 22:36.098
- I don't like you either.

22:41.103 --> 22:42.235
- All she told my dad was that

22:42.278 --> 22:45.281
she was going on a trip
with a few friends.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.417
She said something
on social media

22:50.460 --> 22:53.115
about going to a
cabin, and a lake.

22:54.812 --> 22:58.642
- Wait, do you guys live
in this neighborhood?

22:58.686 --> 22:59.948
- No.

22:59.991 --> 23:01.819
- Then why are you
here searching for her?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.215
- Well this is where the car was

23:06.259 --> 23:07.738
found that her friends took.

23:08.957 --> 23:11.264
Wasn't about a mile
away from here.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.091
- Okay.

23:13.353 --> 23:15.703
- So, are you gonna
like, I don't know

23:15.746 --> 23:17.618
start helping us at all?

23:19.185 --> 23:19.968
- Okay.

23:22.405 --> 23:26.583
So since we are here in this
fine barren establishment.

23:31.022 --> 23:32.763
I will do what I do best.

23:34.287 --> 23:40.206
I will talk to the past, or
the future, or the spirits.

23:40.249 --> 23:43.992
And I will get some information
about your sister, okay.

23:44.035 --> 23:45.298
Give me a moment.

23:53.828 --> 23:56.309
- You haven't asked her name.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.573
- I know her name.

23:59.616 --> 24:01.270
The spirits have
already told me.

24:05.231 --> 24:10.192
Okay, I see darkness
and a dirt road.

24:13.848 --> 24:14.979
I see loneliness.

24:16.764 --> 24:19.245
Has somebody been lost?

24:19.288 --> 24:20.333
And then nothing.

24:22.987 --> 24:25.294
Oh, she's dead!

24:25.338 --> 24:28.863
I'm so sorry.
- Dude.

24:28.906 --> 24:29.951
- Oh, this Cosmo is so good.

24:29.994 --> 24:32.823
- Are you serious?
- What?

24:32.867 --> 24:34.869
- We could have done
that at the theater.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.003
- Quite.

24:44.705 --> 24:47.403
- Okay, what's her name then?

24:48.274 --> 24:49.057
- Um.

25:29.532 --> 25:31.882
- Take one more
step and I'll blast you back

25:31.926 --> 25:34.015
to the hell where you came from.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.154
- Lady, I don't want no trouble.

25:46.288 --> 25:48.116
- Folks around here
have been talkin' about

25:48.159 --> 25:51.206
a man whose been comin'
around here at night.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.340
Looks like the devil,
he brings nothing

25:54.383 --> 25:56.080
but death behind him.

25:58.735 --> 26:00.955
- I'm just looking
for something to eat.

26:00.998 --> 26:03.610
- You'll just be
looking elsewhere.

26:03.653 --> 26:05.307
- Lady, I'll be quick.

26:06.961 --> 26:08.658
- Quick to be leaving.

26:12.619 --> 26:13.750
- Revel.

26:13.794 --> 26:14.577
Revel stop.

26:16.057 --> 26:18.059
- Excuse me, can you
please put down the gun?

26:18.102 --> 26:20.540
- It's my right to
refuse service to anyone,

26:20.583 --> 26:22.455
especially hell spawn.

26:28.591 --> 26:29.288
- That's it.

26:29.331 --> 26:30.332
Take me back.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.382
Good God woman,
put your gun down!

26:36.425 --> 26:38.384
- I'm sorry!
- Get that thing off of me.

26:38.427 --> 26:39.298
You're just insane.

26:43.780 --> 26:45.608
- You don't know what the
fuck you're doing right now.

26:45.652 --> 26:47.218
No, no.

26:47.262 --> 26:48.307
What happened to old
people getting old

26:48.350 --> 26:50.483
and crazy the cute
way, packaging cats

26:50.526 --> 26:52.354
and shit and sending
them to their neighbors?

26:52.398 --> 26:55.052
Why do these backwoods
inbreds have guns?

26:55.096 --> 26:57.620
- I'm sorry I was just.

27:01.668 --> 27:03.452
- You're just insane.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.541
- We need to get inside.

27:05.585 --> 27:07.151
- Over my dead body.

28:11.825 --> 28:13.783
- Revel, Revel just put
pressure on it, okay.

28:13.827 --> 28:15.916
I'm gonna call the police.

28:15.959 --> 28:16.917
- I can't.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.571
- What do you mean you can't?

28:18.614 --> 28:21.312
- Does it look alright?

31:43.514 --> 31:46.300
- The worst time to call, John.

31:46.343 --> 31:48.694
Yes, yes I am taking a shit.

31:50.043 --> 31:51.740
Oh my God, no, don't call me.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.394
Don't call me, shut up.

31:53.437 --> 31:54.830
I'll call you back.

31:54.874 --> 31:55.701
Don't call.

34:52.616 --> 34:54.922
My phone, my phone.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.185
I left it inside.

35:01.147 --> 35:03.105
Shh, where's your phone?

35:04.237 --> 35:05.847
Where's your phone?

35:05.891 --> 35:06.892
Shh.

35:06.935 --> 35:07.675
Think.

35:07.718 --> 35:08.458
They're coming back.

35:08.502 --> 35:09.416
Where's your phone?

35:09.459 --> 35:10.069
- I don't have it!

35:10.112 --> 35:11.070
- Oh my God.

35:12.723 --> 35:14.290
- Stop!
- Where's your phone?

35:14.334 --> 35:15.596
- Get!
- Oh my God.

35:15.639 --> 35:17.076
- Go away.

35:18.294 --> 35:19.078
- Shhh.

36:29.017 --> 36:30.105
- Here we go.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.326
The first step is to die.

36:35.284 --> 36:37.634
The first step is to die.

36:38.766 --> 36:40.072
To die, to die.

36:41.812 --> 36:43.031
The next, smiles.

36:45.425 --> 36:47.340
Nothing but smiles.

36:47.383 --> 36:48.254
Smiles.

36:48.297 --> 36:49.908
Smiles.

36:51.953 --> 36:54.347
Next, smiles.

36:54.390 --> 36:56.044
Nothing but smiles.

38:08.247 --> 38:08.987
Smiles.

38:11.032 --> 38:12.729
Nothing but smiles.

38:13.817 --> 38:14.993
Smiles smiles.

38:21.608 --> 38:23.131
The next, is smiles.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.221
Nothing but smiles.

42:40.432 --> 42:42.042
- Ah, no way!

42:42.085 --> 42:42.869
Oh my God!

42:44.697 --> 42:46.133
Ah, no way.

42:46.176 --> 42:47.395
- Get it off of me!

42:47.439 --> 42:48.744
- Oh my God, what the hell?!

42:48.788 --> 42:50.355
- Get it off!
- Ahh, no way!

42:50.398 --> 42:52.095
- Get if off of me!

43:20.689 --> 43:22.952
- Hurry, get your
ass out of here.

43:22.996 --> 43:24.345
Help me, get her out!

43:24.389 --> 43:25.781
Come on, hurry!

43:30.525 --> 43:34.616
- Hey, don't swallow.

45:39.698 --> 45:42.527
- Yo, whatever your name is,

45:42.570 --> 45:43.919
what the hell was all of that?

45:52.450 --> 45:53.581
I'm still here!

45:59.848 --> 46:00.501
- It's hell.

46:01.807 --> 46:03.286
- Yeah, I saw it.

46:03.330 --> 46:05.637
Did you see what it did
to my thing down here?

46:07.421 --> 46:08.161
What was it though?

46:08.204 --> 46:09.467
Who the hell was that?

46:11.643 --> 46:14.167
- You do this for a living.

46:14.210 --> 46:15.429
You should know.

46:16.822 --> 46:17.736
- Oh my God.

46:17.779 --> 46:19.215
Why are you even talking?

46:19.259 --> 46:23.698
Did you see what your girlfriend
did to you back there?

46:28.660 --> 46:29.574
Oh that helps.

46:41.847 --> 46:43.718
- They've been released.

46:43.762 --> 46:45.067
I didn't want this to happen.

46:46.547 --> 46:48.157
I just wanted it to stop.

46:55.208 --> 46:56.688
- You wanted what to stop?

46:59.734 --> 47:02.520
- All I know is, I
went on vacation,

47:02.563 --> 47:06.698
with my mother and her goldfish.

47:06.741 --> 47:09.222
To a cabin, on a lake.

47:10.571 --> 47:12.268
Everything went
just fine for the

47:12.312 --> 47:13.835
first few hours
of getting there.

47:22.409 --> 47:24.672
Then I was woken
by a strange noise.

47:28.502 --> 47:30.722
I noticed the fish
bowl was empty,

47:30.765 --> 47:33.333
and there was a large
puddle of water that went

47:33.376 --> 47:34.682
down the hall towards
my mothers room.

47:42.690 --> 47:43.691
I followed it.

47:59.620 --> 48:02.884
Then, she beat my
ass and jumped out

48:02.928 --> 48:04.233
the window into the lake.

48:07.802 --> 48:11.676
After that, TV came
on, calling to me.

48:11.719 --> 48:13.373
Begging me to come closer.

48:16.332 --> 48:18.378
So, of course I didn't touch it.

48:20.206 --> 48:22.687
Then I was sucked into a
hell, I couldn't escape.

48:25.254 --> 48:28.475
- So, you touched the TV?

48:30.738 --> 48:32.000
- Didn't you just hear me say

48:32.044 --> 48:34.481
I was sucked into a
hell I couldn't escape?

48:35.743 --> 48:37.310
- Okay then how
are you here now?

48:37.353 --> 48:38.833
- Well he obviously got out.

48:40.879 --> 48:43.098
- Your friends dead,
do you think I escaped?

48:45.144 --> 48:46.624
- Okay, that's uncalled for.

48:49.409 --> 48:51.150
- Like you are one to talk.

48:51.193 --> 48:52.499
You're just a fraud.

48:53.761 --> 48:55.633
- Oh my God, that's
called being an actor.

48:55.676 --> 48:57.286
- Okay, yeah.

48:57.330 --> 48:58.810
Well if you would have told
me and my friend that you were

48:58.853 --> 49:01.987
just an actor, we'd be
hundreds of miles away by now.

49:02.030 --> 49:04.772
But no, you needed your $50.

49:04.816 --> 49:07.470
- Hey, John booked
this damn thing for me.

49:07.514 --> 49:09.472
Anybody you wanna
point fingers at?

49:09.516 --> 49:10.778
John is the guy.

49:10.822 --> 49:12.562
- No, no it's this
guys damn fault.

49:14.826 --> 49:16.828
He's the one that let it loose.

49:16.871 --> 49:20.832
- Hey, you shouldn't go
pointing fingers around here.

49:20.875 --> 49:22.311
- Works for me.

49:22.355 --> 49:23.791
Drop me off at the
next town, okay.

49:23.835 --> 49:25.663
I'm gonna get my own ride.

49:25.706 --> 49:27.186
I'm sorry about your friend.

49:30.842 --> 49:32.713
And I'm sorry you didn't
get your cowboy burger,

49:32.757 --> 49:34.454
whatever you're
getting down there.

49:37.239 --> 49:39.807
My conscience is clear now,
and I'm ready to go home.

49:39.851 --> 49:40.852
Good evening.

49:44.551 --> 49:45.683
- We're not going home.

49:48.076 --> 49:49.948
- You're not, I am.

49:49.991 --> 49:50.862
You can keep her.

49:55.997 --> 49:58.130
- I'm not letting
this thing go free.

49:58.173 --> 49:59.740
We're taking it
back to its home.

50:05.050 --> 50:07.139
- You just said that
we're not going home.

50:08.531 --> 50:09.837
- We're not going to our homes.

50:09.881 --> 50:12.971
We're taking it back to
it's home, the cabin.

50:13.014 --> 50:14.712
- You don't need
all of us for that.

50:16.801 --> 50:18.716
- You two are the
only people I've

50:18.759 --> 50:20.718
seen survive this besides me.

50:22.023 --> 50:24.069
I can't be sure it
won't follow you.

50:24.112 --> 50:25.766
- Oh my God.

50:25.810 --> 50:27.986
- It might take
all of us to bring it back.

50:28.029 --> 50:30.510
- Okay.
- Alright.

50:30.553 --> 50:32.033
- Okay.

50:32.077 --> 50:36.908
Okay, how do we
stop these things?

50:36.951 --> 50:39.301
- We imprison it,
with a special spell.

50:44.611 --> 50:45.960
Blood, and a symbol.

50:47.701 --> 50:50.791
- Oh my gosh, so
highly descriptive.

50:50.835 --> 50:51.749
Let's go!

50:54.969 --> 50:58.146
- Are you gonna at least
show us how to before we go?

51:06.067 --> 51:07.547
You don't know.

51:07.590 --> 51:09.592
- Great.
- Okay, alright.

51:47.108 --> 51:51.025
- So, here we are to learn
about a super secret symbol.

51:52.940 --> 51:55.551
- So, where's the cabin?

51:56.901 --> 51:58.728
- It's on the other side.

51:58.772 --> 51:59.642
We'll have to cross.

52:00.861 --> 52:02.950
- Wait, we have to
swim across the lake?

52:04.169 --> 52:04.909
At night?

52:06.606 --> 52:09.174
Didn't you say there was a
fish creature living in there?

52:09.217 --> 52:12.133
- Yeah, my mom's
in there somewhere.

52:13.787 --> 52:15.789
- Your ugly monster of a mom?

52:15.833 --> 52:19.227
- Can we please learn something
before we go to the cabin?

52:19.271 --> 52:21.142
- She didn't like
the water much.

52:21.186 --> 52:23.362
She might not even
still be here.

52:23.405 --> 52:25.233
- Wow, that's reassuring.

52:29.324 --> 52:30.891
- Am I the only one
that cares about

52:30.935 --> 52:32.893
learning how to
stop these things?

52:34.721 --> 52:36.070
- We'll get to that in a second.

52:39.987 --> 52:42.772
- We're just gonna go up to
the water and ask for your mom?

52:42.816 --> 52:46.602
- Well, that was the plan
until you just insulted it.

52:48.996 --> 52:52.217
- Again, can we please learn
something before we go?

52:54.610 --> 52:56.395
- Okay, gather around.

53:00.399 --> 53:02.053
- These damn bugs are all here.

53:30.081 --> 53:31.952
- This is a protection
symbol I found

53:31.996 --> 53:34.128
on a bathroom stall
in their world.

53:37.436 --> 53:39.133
- Can you, please rephrase that?

53:46.271 --> 53:50.753
- This is a protection symbol
I found in an ancient book.

53:55.976 --> 53:56.759
- Okay.

59:16.557 --> 59:17.645
- Sorry, mom.

59:51.375 --> 59:53.768
- I don't know any of your names

59:53.812 --> 59:55.335
but I hate every one of you.

01:00:12.178 --> 01:00:13.440
Is that the cabin?

01:00:13.484 --> 01:00:15.616
Hey guy, the other
known male here.

01:00:16.922 --> 01:00:19.794
Is that the cabin you
were talking about?

01:00:19.838 --> 01:00:20.621
- Yep.

01:00:23.885 --> 01:00:28.194
- Maybe we should look around
before we go do magic here.

01:00:29.717 --> 01:00:30.675
- Okay, okay.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.633
What about the symbol?

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.515
- Well, this place has changed.

01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:31.649
- Dude, ugh.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.188
- So the grand plan
is we sit and wait?

01:01:49.231 --> 01:01:51.277
- Yeah, that's the plan.

01:01:53.714 --> 01:01:58.589
- Remember, we have to use
blood to bind them to objects.

01:04:00.145 --> 01:04:01.276
- The coast is clear.

01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:40.201
Hey, do you know
who the fuck I am?

01:05:41.463 --> 01:05:44.815
I'm the star of a
failing TV show.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.774
I have five fans that I know of,

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.646
and I'm currently
looking for an agent.

01:05:51.082 --> 01:05:54.738
And you mister, or misses,
you are gonna get fucked up.

01:06:45.092 --> 01:06:46.703
You want some too?

01:06:51.838 --> 01:06:53.622
Oh no, cheating bitch.

01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:19.431
- Just let us in, let us in.

01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:30.659
How much hell have you seen?

01:07:36.796 --> 01:07:38.624
Why do you continue,

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:43.716
you know we aren't
trying to kill you.

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:49.243
Not trying to kill you, yet.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:52.769
Yet, yet, yet.

01:07:57.861 --> 01:07:59.427
Right, right, right.

01:08:04.215 --> 01:08:06.391
Accept us into your heart.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.438
Let us into your heart.

01:08:10.482 --> 01:08:13.093
Heart, just let
us in, let us in.

01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:17.881
There is no winning or losing.

01:08:19.447 --> 01:08:24.017
There is no winning, no winning,
or losing, losing, losing.

01:08:26.933 --> 01:08:28.587
Or losing, no losing.

01:08:46.866 --> 01:08:48.825
- Two tears in a bucket.

01:08:57.484 --> 01:08:59.966
Ugh, I should've gone into porn.

01:14:12.322 --> 01:14:14.628
- There, I've won!

01:14:14.672 --> 01:14:16.195
Are you happy?!

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:17.196
Now you're stuck!

01:16:12.137 --> 01:16:13.225
- What do we do now?

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.052
- We fight.

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:25.411
- Hi, um, this is John.

01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:27.152
Vincent's agent.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:33.941
See, Vincent had a little
memo, and he's been missing.

01:16:37.249 --> 01:16:41.384
And he said that if he
ever went missing for

01:16:41.427 --> 01:16:45.997
a longer period of time,
to contact you guys.

01:16:47.564 --> 01:16:52.308
He said you guys have together
fought monsters or something.

01:16:54.092 --> 01:16:55.659
So, I'm reaching out.

01:17:04.668 --> 01:17:06.234
- I tried.

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:08.454
- You know I think you
actually popped this out.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:09.760
- It's a grandma hit and run,

01:17:09.803 --> 01:17:11.501
this is a freaking
grandma hit and run.

01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:14.242
Oh, my tail lights messed up.

01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:16.897
Stop, stop, stop.

01:17:18.421 --> 01:17:19.683
Shawn, stop it.

01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:24.514
Okay.

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:25.906
- Where do we put this?

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:27.778
- We need the tire, on the car.

01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:29.214
Tire, on the car.

01:17:29.257 --> 01:17:30.520
Grab the tire.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:33.174
- Okay, which way do you
actually put this on?

01:17:36.047 --> 01:17:36.961
- Put down the tire.

01:17:37.004 --> 01:17:37.701
Put down the tire, please.

01:17:38.658 --> 01:17:40.007
Put it down.

01:17:40.051 --> 01:17:41.139
Don't throw the tire!

01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:46.187
- I think you're taking
this way too seriously.

01:17:46.231 --> 01:17:47.537
That thing is rolling.

01:17:50.322 --> 01:17:51.192
Okay.

01:17:51.236 --> 01:17:53.369
Okay, alright, what about this.

01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:54.413
- What do we do?
- Look.

01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:57.198
- What do we do?
- We'll get a car.

01:17:57.242 --> 01:18:00.941
- We need to find Vincent.
- And we'll kick some ass.

01:18:00.985 --> 01:18:01.768
