20:27.935 --> 20:29.895
-No.
-No?

20:30.354 --> 20:34.066
You mean living people
gave you all this stuff?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.028
This would be important to people.

20:38.696 --> 20:42.116
You sure you didn't
drag these off of corpses?

20:42.199 --> 20:44.827
-No.
-Horse pucky. Look.

20:48.539 --> 20:49.790
Saint Christopher Medals.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.793
My granddad had one of these.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.879
Never took it off.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.590
You'd never get it off him
unless he was dead.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.342
-You're disgusting.
-No!

21:08.434 --> 21:09.602
[sobs]

21:09.685 --> 21:11.729
[Warren] So if you're not a grave robber,

21:11.812 --> 21:13.814
you want to tell us
how you got all this stuff?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.941
Why you got all this stuff?

21:17.818 --> 21:18.819
No.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.115
Can you say anything else other than "no?"

21:25.409 --> 21:26.827
Doc, search his bag.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.001
Wow. A cornucopia
of comparative religions.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.922
I always liked this guy. Fat and happy.

21:38.506 --> 21:39.507
That's enlightenment.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.427
Oh, wow.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.970
Would you look at that.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.681
I had a necklace just like this.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.184
Remember, I got it
from that medicine woman, Kuruk.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.313
Please tell me you didn't get this

21:54.396 --> 21:57.608
off of a pretty Native American lady
near the Grand Canyon.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.489
It was this old lady in Sedona.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.784
Family mercied here
right before she turned.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.661
They went right after.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.413
She was holding this.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.417
You took it why?

22:18.379 --> 22:20.965
Maybe he was moved
by the Great Spirit like I was.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.593
No. No. But someone was.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.679
And someone will be again.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.974
Uh... when?

22:30.975 --> 22:33.519
When this is finally all over.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.689
I don't know.

22:36.772 --> 22:40.067
Taking necklaces from dead ladies
sounds like grave robbing to me.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.611
-You found him coming from downstairs?
-Mm-hm.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.573
Downstairs like a basement?
Or downstairs like a crypt?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.742
You mean crypt like more dead people?

22:48.826 --> 22:50.828
No, not just any dead people.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.956
Important dead people. Rich dead people.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.167
Been digging for treasures, have you?

22:59.628 --> 23:01.964
-You can say that, yeah.
-Mmm.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.551
-No, but it's not what you think.
-No?

23:06.844 --> 23:11.682
Have any of you ever heard
of Saint Teresa of Aurea?

23:13.142 --> 23:15.811
[wood splintering]

23:18.022 --> 23:20.899
There is a relic here.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.404
A bone from her finger.
It's supposed to cure the sick.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.156
[snickering]

23:27.239 --> 23:30.159
And if you buy that, I got a bunch
of other crap I can sell you.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.871
Look, you can believe
whatever you want to.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.581
Quit trying to get us killed.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.916
I'm sorry about that.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.752
I am.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.172
I just, I didn't know who you were.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.341
And people are weird now.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.468
Dangerous.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.678
[scoffs] Well that's an understatement.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.182
This relic is really worth
you risking your life?

23:55.893 --> 23:59.146
Uh, people, we have a horde situation
happening here.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.483
-We got to vamoose, pronto.
-No, we can't. There's already too many.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.736
-Well, we can't stay here.
-All the ways out of here are blocked.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.779
I know a way out.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.995
That's the crypt down there
where your Saint is?

24:15.079 --> 24:17.122
There's also a tunnel, a way out.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.749
It leads to an old graveyard.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.169
Whatever we're doing,
we better start doing it.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.462
Help me move this.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.507
[groaning]

24:28.175 --> 24:29.718
Push!

25:30.362 --> 25:31.989
10K, help me!

25:32.781 --> 25:34.199
Pull the slab!

25:45.586 --> 25:48.338
Is it just me or does that Z
reek more than usual?

25:49.256 --> 25:51.341
Is this the tunnel? Is this the way out?

25:54.845 --> 25:56.805
[sizzling]134

26:14.740 --> 26:15.949
This your Saint?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.038
Her relic is buried in there.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.332
Along with a bishop from the '20s.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.505
Upstairs you said
that her finger bone healed people?

26:30.005 --> 26:34.927
Saint Teresa... of Aurea.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.096
She was a young girl.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.350
Said that God gave her
the gift to cure people.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.771
She laid her hands on the sick, and she...

26:45.854 --> 26:48.649
she never asked for a penny.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.820
Her father, he wanted to marry her off.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.491
He needed the money.
And she just wanted to remain a virgin.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.326
Heal people for God.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.706
Once she refused to marry
a wealthy man twice her age, and...

27:05.791 --> 27:08.585
he killed her in a rage.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.842
If the bone was so miraculous,
why'd they bury it down here?

27:17.302 --> 27:20.013
This bishop must've been
pretty powerful, I guess.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.474
He wanted the relic.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.311
-He got it.
-Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.273
-We hit a brick wall.
-What do you mean?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.984
There's a wall, made of bricks.
Your friend lied to us.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.360
Uh... I didn't lie.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.114
I didn't know about the bricks.
They weren't on the blueprints.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.198
Give us your ax.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.534
Come on.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.304
Think you can help me with this?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.390
Maybe there's a latch or something.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.062
You know, not many people
still got religion, after all this.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.609
I don't...

28:14.318 --> 28:17.779
I mean old white dude in the sky?

28:19.239 --> 28:23.869
But if this relic can really cure people,

28:25.746 --> 28:29.041
people are gonna need healing
once all this is over.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.002
You think this will be over?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.171
I call that faith.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.175
Uh... That's just basic survival.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.386
You got to believe this will end, right?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.139
If you don't, hug a zombie.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.441
Why do you have all that stuff
if you're not a believer?

28:57.611 --> 28:59.947
My ma was a good Catholic.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.325
It really made no sense to me,

29:03.408 --> 29:05.452
but I was glad she had something,
you know?

29:06.245 --> 29:07.537
It was comforting.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.793
And then one day,
the whole world lost its mind.

29:13.794 --> 29:14.753
Literally.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.674
It was bad that first night.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.218
I was in a garage. I...

29:21.301 --> 29:22.970
used to be a mechanic.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.224
Hey. Me too.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.398
It was in the middle of the city,
but t seemed like ground zero.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.984
Alvin, my boss,

29:37.985 --> 29:39.569
he was the first to turn.

29:41.655 --> 29:42.990
And then my buddy, Juan.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.995
And it was up to me to put them both down.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.540
And it took forever.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.837
Didn't know back then that you had to...

29:59.423 --> 30:01.633
[growling]

30:08.432 --> 30:12.060
<i>All I could hear
was the screaming outside.</i>

30:12.894 --> 30:15.647
<i>And the sound of me with my wrench...</i>

30:16.356 --> 30:18.442
<i>-hitting.</i>
-[screaming]

30:21.737 --> 30:22.988
And then it was done.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.616
They were dead.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.577
And it was dark.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.414
But somehow, Juan's stupid candle,

30:32.497 --> 30:36.209
you know,
the one with the Virgin Mary on it,

30:39.504 --> 30:40.922
it kept burning.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.510
That's some kind of miracle.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.142
It was a light.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.314
I needed it. So I took it.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.358
And ever since then, it was like...

31:01.860 --> 31:03.612
I just kept finding stuff.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.657
Yeah, some might say you were called.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.120
No. I don't think so.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.040
I like to think more like it's...

31:16.166 --> 31:17.584
gives me something to do.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.795
A reason to keep going.

31:20.754 --> 31:21.755
A mission.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.301
What if it's not a real mission?

31:26.385 --> 31:30.097
-What do you mean?
-What if it ends up meaning nothing?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.766
Like the Apocalypse never ends.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.977
Or it does and nobody wants
that stuff anymore.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.772
How do you know you're...

31:39.689 --> 31:42.692
how do you know
you're doing something good

31:42.776 --> 31:43.819
or you're just...

31:47.447 --> 31:48.615
delusional?

31:53.161 --> 31:54.246
I don't.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.129
Um...

32:03.004 --> 32:04.423
Let me see if I can

32:05.090 --> 32:07.092
find something to help you
lift this thing.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.937
-You still got that pry bar?
-Yeah.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.483
-Warren, wanna look at this?
-I'll take it.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.782
Here you go.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.745
Thanks.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.625
So this Saint Aurea...

32:41.710 --> 32:43.295
she had a pretty crappy dad, huh?

32:44.212 --> 32:46.006
All those girl saints did.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.675
Well,

32:49.759 --> 32:51.636
Saint Lucy had a crappy mom.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.764
Saint Lucy?

32:54.848 --> 32:57.517
Uh, Patron Saint of the blind.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.769
And epidemics.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.441
She was...

33:06.693 --> 33:08.403
My daughter's name was Lucy.

33:11.031 --> 33:11.865
Was?

33:13.783 --> 33:15.285
She was supposed to...

33:16.870 --> 33:18.705
She could've cured everyone.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.292
Healed everyone.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.253
Just like...

33:27.756 --> 33:28.965
And then she...

33:31.301 --> 33:32.802
They would've called her Saint.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.514
My Lucy.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.140
After she saved everyone.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.769
After she lived forever and we...

33:43.104 --> 33:44.189
But she didn't.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.026
She died.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.906
She died saving my life.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.784
She wasn't a Saint.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.537
She was just a little girl.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.000
I don't know.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.296
Sacrificing yourself for someone you love?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.381
[grunts]

34:10.632 --> 34:13.093
I don't think it gets more holy than that.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.135
Do you?

34:19.015 --> 34:20.475
We need to get more leverage.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.481
We need that pickaxe.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.692
It's important.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.954
On three. Ready?

34:41.037 --> 34:43.164
One, two, three.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.710
[sizzling]

35:04.477 --> 35:05.437
[growling]

35:08.523 --> 35:10.442
[growling]

35:21.536 --> 35:23.496
What happened to love thy neighbor?

35:23.580 --> 35:24.539
Hey, Bishop!

35:24.623 --> 35:26.583
One! Two! Three!

35:33.548 --> 35:35.467
I thought he was supposed to be dead dead?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.010
It's a Mad Z miracle.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.681
It doesn't open.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.225
There's no secret compartment.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.062
It's not the relic.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.482
It's just a cross.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.202
It's empty.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.666
Well, then it's probably time to go.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.918
Oh, yeah, about that...

36:12.712 --> 36:15.590
[Sergeant] There's another wall,
behind this one. Ain't going this way.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.268
I have one grenade left.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.562
Nope, don't even think about it.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.107
We don't need a grenade,
we need a miracle,

36:32.190 --> 36:33.400
an actual one.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.695
Well, I think it's safe to say, Warren,

36:36.778 --> 36:39.072
we ain't gonna find one here.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.782
[church bells ring]

36:40.865 --> 36:42.450
Oh, come on.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.578
Somebody's ringing the bells.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.668
The Zs are all leaving.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.343
[growling]

37:01.344 --> 37:03.888
It's just zombies,
tangled up in bell pulls.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.626
It's a little girl. She's been mercied.

37:33.710 --> 37:37.088
-It's a first communion Z.
-She's holding something.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.686
It's the relic.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.692
Now that's what I call a damn miracle.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.237
Saint Lucy.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.544
[growling]

38:45.156 --> 38:46.699
Wow.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.993
It's even more beautiful than I thought.

38:51.746 --> 38:52.580
Could I?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.061
Thank you.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.105
You're welcome.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.026
Thank you.

I didn't do anything.

39:26.072 --> 39:26.906
It was just there.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.954
I'd like to give you something.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.456
For helping me, you know, and...

39:36.499 --> 39:37.667
not killing me.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.378
Is there anything you need?

39:41.170 --> 39:43.798
Maybe something to help you keep going.

39:43.882 --> 39:49.095
Got anything useful in there?
Bullets? Aspirin? Toilet paper?

39:52.515 --> 39:54.017
I got batteries.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.318
My man.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.328
Hey.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.044
Keep the faith, brother.

40:23.630 --> 40:24.756
I will.

-She can't hear you.

41:08.049 --> 41:09.592
