WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:17.017
-He said it with a straight face.
-No.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.232
You want one--

00:23.315 --> 00:25.400
No. I think two is my limit.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.278
With that attitude,
the Koreans are gonna eat us alive.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.405
Are we negotiating
an East Asian space alliance,

00:30.489 --> 00:32.115
or is this gonna be a drinking contest?

00:32.198 --> 00:35.244
Can't have one without the other.
Not in Seoul.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.414
You thought the UN delegates
were party animals. Just wait.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.461
You're gonna be great.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.131
You were born to do this job.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.764
You know, Tom, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.352
I think I might--

01:01.228 --> 01:03.313
-You're pregnant.
-No.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.983
No. It's not that.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.484
I...

01:09.570 --> 01:12.281
Excuse me, Ellen Wilson? Room 147?

01:12.364 --> 01:13.866
-Yes, thank you.
-Phone for you.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.450
Sorry.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.953
This is Ellen Wilson.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.835
Okay. Thank you.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.890
My father had a heart attack.
It doesn't sound good.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.100
I'm so sorry.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.439
He's in Connecticut, right?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.815
Yeah.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.527
Use the limo.
I'll take a taxi to the airport--

01:50.611 --> 01:53.447
-No, I can't do that. The Korean--
-You can't not do that.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.617
This is family.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.204
Go.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.957
I'll call you.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.584
Thank you.

02:12.508 --> 02:16.261
Poor thing.
She was so excited about going to Korea.

02:16.345 --> 02:20.432
Hopefully her father will recover,
and she can join me in a day or two.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.684
Must have been a rough night for her.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.895
How about you? Did you get any sleep?

02:25.312 --> 02:28.106
Of course not.
You know I can't sleep on planes.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.733
It's a 14-hour flight.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.817
Martini, sir.

02:30.901 --> 02:34.488
These long international flights
are the only time I can really focus.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.822
No distractions.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.244
Just me, my martini
and the Apollo-Soyuz budget requests.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.871
Some light reading, huh?

02:42.955 --> 02:46.542
You should try reading a novel
once in a while.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.586
It'd be good for your mind
to just tune out.

02:50.254 --> 02:56.176
I just finished this one called Christine,
about this 1958 homicidal Plymouth.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.054
Yeah. My new electric car's
tried to kill me a few times.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.236
How are Poole and Morrison doing?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.238
Everything going okay in Russia?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.615
By all accounts
the training's going smoothly.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.700
Good.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.749
Still can't quite believe it's happening.

03:27.833 --> 03:31.837
Our astronauts in Star City,
their engineers in Houston.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.088
I know.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.804
I was calling to check in on one point
on the negotiations

03:40.888 --> 03:42.848
for the EASA before we land.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.809
Check away.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.027
For this proposed space station,
are we real--

03:58.488 --> 04:00.032
Tom, you there?

04:02.701 --> 04:03.702
Tom?

04:05.287 --> 04:08.665
If you'd like to make
a call, please hang up and try--

05:38.630 --> 05:41.300
I'm sorry you missed your flight
for nothing.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.969
I blame your mother for overreacting.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.263
It's not nothing, Dad.
You had a heart attack.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.265
A minor incident. I feel fine.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.600
A wake-up call.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.645
You heard the doctor.
No more red meat, no more smoking.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.189
And you have to slow down.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.566
Though we all know that'll never happen.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.402
I'm running
a half-a-billion-dollar company.

06:00.485 --> 06:04.615
We just extended into Asia.
Got a new hub in Europe and another--

06:04.698 --> 06:05.699
I know.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.287
You want me to slow down,
I'm gonna need your help.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.124
And obviously
that's not gonna happen right now.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.881
Maybe you're being a little...
shortsighted.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.800
What are you saying?

06:28.472 --> 06:30.098
I'm thinking about leaving NASA.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.475
Bullshit.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.185
I'm serious.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.436
I wanna get to Mars,

06:34.520 --> 06:38.023
and I'm starting to think that private
spaceflight is the only way to get there.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.525
Interesting.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.071
What does Larry have to say
about you changing course?

06:44.154 --> 06:47.574
Larry... wants me to be happy.

06:48.951 --> 06:49.952
Wherever I am.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.706
One thing I don't have to worry about,

06:54.790 --> 06:58.085
you'll always have a solid man
by your side.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.005
Not that I wouldn't mind
a grandchild or two.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.425
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am,
but the White House is calling for you.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.221
-The White House?
-That's what they said.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.105
This is Ellen Wilson.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.407
...news.
Special report. Here is Dan Rather.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.491
Yes.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.870
President Reagan arriving at this moment

07:32.953 --> 07:35.205
at Point Mugu Naval Air Station
in California,

07:35.289 --> 07:39.501
taking him from his California vacation
back to work in Washington.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.421
A vacation cut short by the shooting down

07:42.504 --> 07:45.674
of Korean Air Lines flight 7
by the Soviets,

07:45.757 --> 07:49.386
with the apparent loss of as many as 269,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.096
all of the persons aboard.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.183
President Reagan is expected
to deliver a statement shortly.

07:54.266 --> 07:58.312
From Moscow, still no official
confirmation of the plane's downing.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.106
Just that there was, quote, "an accident,"

08:01.190 --> 08:03.609
but not even what kind of accident
from the Soviets

08:03.692 --> 08:05.569
and nothing in the way of an apology.

08:05.652 --> 08:10.490
In the wake of the barbaric act
committed yesterday by the Soviet regime

08:11.074 --> 08:13.452
against a commercial jetliner,

08:13.535 --> 08:16.038
the United States
and many other countries of the world

08:16.121 --> 08:18.415
made clear and compelling statements

08:18.999 --> 08:21.126
that expressed not only our outrage

08:21.210 --> 08:24.630
but also our demand
for a truthful accounting of the facts.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.173
What can we think of a regime

08:26.256 --> 08:31.345
that so broadly trumpets its vision
of peace and global disarmament

08:31.428 --> 08:34.765
and yet so callously and quickly
commits a terrorist act

08:34.847 --> 08:37.433
to sacrifice the lives
of innocent human beings?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.186
And what are we to make of a regime

08:39.269 --> 08:42.563
which establishes
one set of standards for itself

08:42.648 --> 08:45.108
and another for the rest of humankind?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.612
To the families of
Congressman Lawrence McDonald,

08:48.695 --> 08:53.700
NASA Administrator Thomas Paine
and all those on the ill-fated aircraft,

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
we send our deepest sympathy.

08:57.287 --> 09:01.250
And I hope they know
our prayers are with them all.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.755
What the hell was that airliner doing
flying over Sakhalin?

09:06.839 --> 09:08.590
It's not even on its flight path.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.801
Could have been a navigational error.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.804
Flight computer could have caused
the plane to deviate from its route.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.514
400 miles?

09:16.181 --> 09:18.183
Maybe something was wrong
with the autopilot.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.603
Poor bastard probably never even knew
he'd entered Soviet airspace.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.690
So the pilot accidentally wanders
into a protected area.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.149
Why shoot down the plane?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.819
It's a commercial airliner,
for God's sake.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.571
It doesn't make any sense.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.198
We've got spy planes
flying over Sakhalin all the time.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.242
It's a secret air base. They're paranoid.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.161
I'm sorry. It is beyond inconceivable

09:38.245 --> 09:41.540
that any pilot could mistake
an American reconnaissance plane

09:41.623 --> 09:43.625
with a Korean passenger jumbo jet.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.043
I don't buy that for a second.

09:45.127 --> 09:49.173
It's more likely they suspected KAL 7
was being used as a spy plane.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.676
Was it?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.015
Don't be ridiculous.

09:58.891 --> 10:03.145
Why would the United States use
another nation's passenger plane to spy?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.855
We are wasting time here.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.817
All that matters is I haven't been able
to reach Poole and Morrison in Star City.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.778
I have tried every line.
It's radio silence.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.866
The FBI shut down access
to all Soviet officials in the US,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.327
including the Apollo-Soyuz engineers,

10:18.410 --> 10:20.120
so they're probably responding to that.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.248
They are holding our people hostage.
That's not okay.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.416
She's right.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.504
Ellen.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.506
I've spoken with Jim Baker
at the White House.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.383
Until the president appoints
a permanent replacement,

10:33.467 --> 10:36.970
I'll be fulfilling Tom's duties
as acting administrator.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.728
Now, reestablishing communication
with our astronauts

10:44.811 --> 10:46.980
is our top priority at this point.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.316
Maybe I should get in touch
with Sergei Nikulov,

10:49.399 --> 10:52.319
see if he could help us
get in touch with our people, and--

10:52.402 --> 10:54.029
We just got attacked by the Soviets.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.739
You're gonna reach out to 'em
and ask for help?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.242
Sergei will listen to reason.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.537
They have shown time and again
that they can't be trusted.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.289
This should all run through the NSC.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.293
Well, I think we need to pursue
all available options

11:08.377 --> 11:10.379
before this turns into
an even bigger incident.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.759
Go talk to him. Hopefully
he knows of a way to reach Star City.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.055
Thank you.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.057
Your call.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.117
Damn it!

11:47.791 --> 11:49.209
Let me out!

12:14.067 --> 12:15.068
What can I do for you?

12:15.152 --> 12:17.529
I'm Margo Madison.
I need to see Sergei Nikulov.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.282
No one goes in, no one goes out.
Those are my orders.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.076
I'm the director, Johnson Space Center.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.246
I'm sure you are, honey,
but you're not getting in.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.042
-What's your name?
-Sergeant John Perkins.

12:30.125 --> 12:34.171
Okay, Sergeant John Perkins,
I know you have a job to do, but so do I.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.424
I'm gonna give you 15 seconds to
get in touch with your superior officer,

12:37.508 --> 12:39.927
12 seconds
to explain the situation to him,

12:40.010 --> 12:42.763
45 seconds for him to reach
General Nelson Bradford

12:42.846 --> 12:44.765
and confirm I am who I say I am.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.184
Another 15 seconds
for your boss to get back to you

12:47.267 --> 12:48.769
and ten for you to open this door.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.562
That puts you 97 seconds away

12:50.646 --> 12:52.689
from either a cold beer
at the end of your shift

12:52.773 --> 12:57.319
or an open-ended transfer
to Thule, Greenland.

13:00.531 --> 13:01.990
Your time starts now.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
Honey.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.331
I brought borscht.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.999
Come in.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.514
Did you try the embassy?

13:25.597 --> 13:27.099
Radio silence.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.481
I don't think anything will happen
to your astronauts.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.195
Somehow that's not
making me feel any better.

13:43.365 --> 13:48.871
I know it's a lot to ask,
considering the situation...

13:49.997 --> 13:52.541
but do you have a way
to get in touch with Star City?

13:52.624 --> 13:53.959
A secret line, or,

13:54.042 --> 13:57.796
I don't know, something that might put us
closer to making contact with our people?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.257
What can I do?
I'm trapped here with no phone.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.594
See? Dead?

14:04.553 --> 14:06.096
What if I could arrange a call?

14:06.180 --> 14:09.308
Astronauts Poole and Morrison,
they're not a part of all this.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.019
Nor am I. And yet here I am.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.730
Also being held against my will,
unable to call home.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.773
Thomas Paine was killed, Sergei.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.735
Along with 268 others.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.029
That's why we're here.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.038
I'm sorry about your colleague.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.126
Tom was a good man.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.587
Frustrating at times,

14:38.670 --> 14:40.547
I didn't always agree with his methods,

14:40.631 --> 14:46.345
but he gave everything to his job,
and I respected the hell out of him.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.479
In my religion, when someone dies,

14:55.562 --> 14:59.191
it is custom to make the first meal
you eat after the funeral

14:59.274 --> 15:03.654
a bowl of how you might call
memorial borscht.

15:07.074 --> 15:11.745
It is believed that the steam
will carry the soul of the departed...

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
to heaven.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.170
Maybe it's true.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.182
When you get me the telephone,

15:32.266 --> 15:35.018
I will call Moscow
and tell them that I'm not being tortured.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.731
Other than weak borscht.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.989
You know, maybe they will
get in touch with your astronauts,

15:47.072 --> 15:48.407
but I cannot promise.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.661
Thank you, Sergei.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.627
It was another day
of dramatic developments

16:00.711 --> 16:03.172
in the case of the plane
shot from the sky.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.383
The shooting down
of Korean Air Lines flight 007.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.802
The Soviets admitted for the first time

16:08.886 --> 16:13.724
one of their fighters shot down
the jumbo jet and the 269 people on board.

16:13.807 --> 16:18.145
But the Russians insisted they didn't know
that it was a civilian airliner.

16:18.729 --> 16:22.065
The United States reacts
with revulsion to this attack.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.527
Loss of life appears to be heavy.

16:26.278 --> 16:31.241
We can see no excuse whatsoever
for this appalling act.

16:31.325 --> 16:34.161
There is no possible legitimate excuse

16:34.244 --> 16:38.540
that the Soviet government could put
forward for this despicable action.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.210
People throughout the free world
are continuing to react...

16:41.293 --> 16:44.755
No, I understand, Senator. We're doing
everything we can to get through to them.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.715
Yep.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.177
-President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea...
-Thank you. Yep.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.013
...accused the Soviet Union of committing
an act of indescribable...

16:53.096 --> 16:54.681
Can you put a little sugar in there?

16:54.765 --> 16:56.600
Ask him about the UN.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.979
Yes. No-- Yes, of course we are, Senator.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.565
Has anyone spoken
to Ambassador Kirkpatrick?

17:03.649 --> 17:06.276
Hey. Is it a bad time?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.324
Yes. Yes, Senator, I'm still here.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.285
-It's nice to see you, Pam.
-You too, Larry.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.372
How's she holding up?

17:18.454 --> 17:21.458
She's a machine.
The phone hasn't stopped ringing all day.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.085
She keeps going and going.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.378
Hey, is Tower on the Ways and Means?

17:25.462 --> 17:26.839
Appropriations.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.051
Yes. And, Senator,
in the wake of this crisis,

17:31.134 --> 17:34.012
NASA is going to need
some additional funding for security.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.597
Can I count on your support?

17:38.183 --> 17:40.727
-That's excellent news.
-Ask for ten.

17:40.811 --> 17:43.313
Is ten too much to expect?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.941
Wonderful, Senator. Thank you.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.278
We can talk more about that, of course.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.366
No, understood. We'll have to let him know
first thing in the morning.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.159
I'll call Guam and relay the message.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.458
Oh, yeah. Try to get some sleep, Clark.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.588
I know. We'll get through this.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.134
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.930
Sorry.

18:17.014 --> 18:19.892
I don't think I've spent this much time
on the phone in my entire life.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.352
Don't apologize for doing your job.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.772
Pretty fucking amazing at it.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.483
Is it obvious that
I have no idea what I'm doing?

18:28.567 --> 18:32.821
Stop it. You're brilliant. You know that.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.287
Come on. Okay?

18:45.459 --> 18:47.503
That feels really good.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.644
Hi.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.816
How are you?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.026
I'm fine.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.031
I am. I mean, I'm...

19:19.243 --> 19:20.410
exhausted.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.539
And overwhelmed.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.500
And, I don't know, I just...

19:27.835 --> 19:31.463
keep playing it over and over in my head.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.844
What if my dad didn't have a heart attack?
I would have been on that plane.

19:36.927 --> 19:40.264
I would have been sitting
right next to Tom. The two of us.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.141
He would have been
the last person I ever saw.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.476
Stop thinking that.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.437
It didn't happen, okay?

19:48.647 --> 19:50.983
If you were meant to be on that plane,
you would have been on it.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.069
What-- Tom was meant to be on that plane?

19:54.152 --> 19:55.445
No. I--

19:56.071 --> 19:58.073
Right, Tom was meant to die.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.201
I'm saying...

20:03.120 --> 20:07.583
sometimes we don't...
understand the way the universe works.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.549
He was such a good man.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.429
So misunderstood.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.223
And now he's just...

20:24.474 --> 20:27.728
floating somewhere in the Sea of Japan.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.733
All of those people, they're just floating
somewhere in the Sea of Japan.

20:32.816 --> 20:33.817
Stop it.

20:35.819 --> 20:36.820
Hey.

20:38.906 --> 20:43.577
You're here. Alive. With me.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.373
And I'm so damn grateful that you are.

20:51.793 --> 20:52.920
Come here.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.684
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's fine.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.065
This is Ellen Wilson.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.443
This is the White House operator.
Please hold for the president.

21:18.987 --> 21:19.988
What?

21:20.072 --> 21:22.199
Hello? Ellen?

21:22.282 --> 21:23.992
Hello, Mr. President.

21:24.785 --> 21:25.827
What?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.080
It's an honor to speak with you.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.917
Well, I'm sorry
it's under these circumstances.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.001
So am I.

21:33.085 --> 21:35.295
Tom was a great American.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.297
I considered him a friend.

21:37.381 --> 21:40.843
And I'll miss him very much,
as I'm sure you will too.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.261
I will.

21:42.344 --> 21:46.849
And I have every confidence
you'll do a wonderful job for me, Ellen.

21:46.932 --> 21:50.143
Tom was a big fan of yours.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.854
I'll try not to let you down.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.564
Are you a Christian, Ellen?

21:57.067 --> 22:00.779
Yes. Yes, I am, sir.

22:00.863 --> 22:04.575
Prayer sustains me in times of crisis.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.785
I hope it does the same for you.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.122
Yes, sir. It does.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.707
I'm glad.

22:11.790 --> 22:15.419
'Cause I'll need everyone on my team
clear-eyed for what's ahead.

22:15.502 --> 22:20.382
We have to show strength in
the shadow of catastrophe, or all is lost.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.592
I understand.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.428
Thank you, Ellen.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.347
Thank you, Mr. President.

22:27.431 --> 22:29.016
Good night.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.777
-Got a minute?
-You know I don't.

22:40.861 --> 22:43.197
Were you able to get Nikulov
to help out with our situation?

22:43.280 --> 22:46.825
He said he'd do his best, but we still
haven't heard from Poole and Morrison.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.160
I expected as much.

22:48.243 --> 22:51.038
I still had to try, Nelson.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.749
Well, maybe this will help you see
what they're really about.

22:53.832 --> 22:56.210
The Pentagon just received
these reconnaissance photographs.

22:56.293 --> 22:59.796
It appears that the Soviets have put
their Buran shuttle on the launchpad.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.090
I didn't think
it was that close to launch-ready.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.759
Neither did we.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.553
-This doesn't look like Baikonur.
-That's because it isn't.

23:07.221 --> 23:10.557
It's Sakhalin Island. They have
a secret military facility there.

23:10.641 --> 23:15.729
The same secret military facility that KAL
was flying over when it was shot down?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.940
-These weren't taken by--
-Of course not.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.068
These photos were taken by
an SR-71 Blackbird.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.653
The KAL was a commercial airliner.

23:22.736 --> 23:24.363
You're telling me KAL was flying over

23:24.446 --> 23:26.323
the same island
Buran is being launched from,

23:26.406 --> 23:28.116
and these two events are not connected?

23:28.200 --> 23:29.701
That's not why I'm here.

23:31.745 --> 23:37.167
I need you to take a look at these
and tell us if the Buran can be armed.

23:37.251 --> 23:41.713
After KAL and after
what's going on in Panama, we're...

23:41.797 --> 23:45.300
concerned that they might be trying
to introduce a new weapon.

23:53.183 --> 23:54.810
Where did you get these?

24:00.190 --> 24:01.817
It's confidential, I know.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.530
This is so bizarre.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.575
It's like I'm looking
at plans for our shuttle.

24:09.658 --> 24:11.618
The orbiters are exactly alike.

24:11.702 --> 24:14.663
That's what happens when the KGB
steals the plans for our shuttle

24:14.746 --> 24:15.873
right out from under us.

24:15.956 --> 24:18.917
It's the same, down to the payload bay.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.670
So it can certainly be armed,
just like ours can.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.798
Hang on. Look at this.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.633
What?

24:26.717 --> 24:28.343
The solid rocket boosters.

24:28.427 --> 24:32.973
They're an exact replica of ours...
but from two years ago.

24:34.433 --> 24:35.517
Okay?

24:35.601 --> 24:38.103
That's where we found
the O-ring problem on Challenger.

24:38.187 --> 24:40.480
And Sakhalin gets
a whole lot colder than Florida.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.774
So if they copied our boosters
to that extent,

24:42.858 --> 24:45.611
it's just a matter of time
until this thing blows up.

24:49.281 --> 24:50.741
We've gotta warn them.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.077
Margo, they've got
smart people over there.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.538
We caught the O-ring.
I'm sure they caught the problem.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.498
You don't know that. Not for sure.

24:58.582 --> 24:59.833
You're right, I don't.

24:59.917 --> 25:03.837
But I do know that this thing has the
potential to be armed for use against us.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.592
Now, they can drop munitions
on any point on Earth...

25:08.675 --> 25:09.927
with no warning.

25:10.010 --> 25:13.263
And don't tell me they don't
have that potential. Not after KAL.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.598
Yes, I understand.

25:16.016 --> 25:20.771
But if they decide to use Buran as
a weapon at some point in the future,

25:20.854 --> 25:22.231
that's their choice.

25:22.314 --> 25:25.025
We have a choice right now
to save human lives.

25:25.984 --> 25:30.447
Dozens of civilians, engineers,
scientists, they could be killed.

25:30.531 --> 25:32.199
We have the power to prevent that.

25:32.282 --> 25:35.452
I'm not gonna take that risk. I'm sorry.

25:36.787 --> 25:39.248
The answer's no.
And this remains classified.

25:48.048 --> 25:51.593
Russian officials have denied
that his country intentionally shot down

25:51.677 --> 25:54.263
a Korean Air Lines 747.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.722
The United States government,

25:55.806 --> 25:58.892
in cooperation
with the government of Japan,

25:58.976 --> 26:03.814
has decided to spread the evidence
before this council and the world.

26:04.439 --> 26:08.068
It is available on the videotape,
which will be played.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.863
Roger.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.783
I'm closing in on the target.
I'm in lock-on.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.371
I've executed the launch.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.877
The target is destroyed.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.171
At approximately 1600 hours,

26:27.254 --> 26:32.593
the Soviet pilot reported that he fired
a missile, and the target was destroyed.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.428
Japanese radar operators

26:34.511 --> 26:36.847
had tracked the progress
of the Korean plane...

26:36.930 --> 26:39.474
Chardonnay and two
Shirley Temples for table three.

26:40.559 --> 26:43.729
-Looks like you got a leak.
-Yeah. Damn it.

26:43.812 --> 26:47.816
And the toilet in the men's bathroom
is clogged again, so...

26:47.900 --> 26:49.193
Want me to take a look at it?

26:49.943 --> 26:52.029
Would you please? That'd be great.

26:52.112 --> 26:55.490
I should have just replaced
the whole system when I remodeled,

26:55.574 --> 26:57.576
but I was trying to save a buck, so...

26:59.119 --> 27:01.705
-Howdy, Miss Karen.
-Hi, Sam.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.124
Hey, boys, why don't you find
a seat right there.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.127
He sure has been coming in a lot
since your mom's been gone.

27:07.711 --> 27:08.921
Maybe he misses her.

27:09.505 --> 27:11.840
Probably more like a good way
to remind potential investors

27:11.924 --> 27:13.258
that he's married to an astronaut.

27:13.342 --> 27:14.676
Or that.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.095
I need three Scotch and sodas.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.931
But one, only do a splash of Scotch in,

27:19.014 --> 27:21.433
'cause Sam only likes to look like
he's pounding them back.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.726
No problem.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.977
Thank you.

27:24.061 --> 27:26.104
I hope this kid's
not giving you too much grief.

27:26.188 --> 27:28.649
Of course not. He's doing a great job.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.026
Well, I'm sure. He is a good kid.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.987
Yeah, he is. How's Trace?

27:34.530 --> 27:36.365
I haven't spoken to her in a couple days.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.575
Apparently, the moon is a very busy place.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.078
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.830
-How's business?
-We've had the best month yet.

27:44.581 --> 27:47.167
Putting those trinkets in that case,
now that was a great idea.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.752
Yeah, believe it or not,

27:48.836 --> 27:52.297
those things earn almost as much profit
as anything else in here.

27:52.381 --> 27:53.715
Well, I believe it.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.637
-So, you ready to sell me this place yet?
-The answer's still no.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.180
That's too bad.

28:00.764 --> 28:03.392
'Cause with just a little push,
this place is about ready to explode.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.270
Could franchise it. Go national.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.815
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

28:12.109 --> 28:13.402
Or maybe today.

28:16.864 --> 28:17.865
What's that?

28:17.948 --> 28:20.284
I said maybe I'm ready
to sell you the bar today.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.123
Are you serious?

28:27.124 --> 28:28.917
Well, depends on what you're offering.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.421
250.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.215
No.

28:36.842 --> 28:37.885
300 then.

28:41.889 --> 28:43.140
450.

28:45.475 --> 28:48.645
350. This is the Outpost, not the Ritz.

28:49.229 --> 28:50.314
400.

28:50.397 --> 28:53.150
With the trinkets in the case,
it's worth at least that much.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.068
Plus, it's only gonna
appreciate over time.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.737
375.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.072
-390.
-Sold.

29:00.282 --> 29:01.325
What?

29:02.618 --> 29:03.869
I'm sorry.

29:03.952 --> 29:08.207
Did I just sell you the Outpost
for $390,000?

29:08.290 --> 29:09.917
Not until you shake my hand, you didn't.

29:12.044 --> 29:13.253
That's all it takes?

29:13.337 --> 29:15.130
This is Texas, darling.

29:15.714 --> 29:17.466
A handshake means more than a notary.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
All right.

29:24.932 --> 29:26.683
We'll get that paperwork signed next week.

29:29.061 --> 29:30.062
Okay.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.898
May I come in?

30:15.899 --> 30:16.900
Who are you?

30:18.610 --> 30:22.114
I am engineer. Come. Sit down.

30:25.158 --> 30:28.328
I've been locked up in this room
for almost 48 hours with no explanation.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.330
Sit down.

30:30.414 --> 30:31.665
I need to talk to my people.

30:31.748 --> 30:35.794
Sit down.
Let's have a drink. Slice of meat.

30:36.378 --> 30:39.089
I don't wanna sit down.
I wanna get the hell out of here.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.008
Do you like vodka?

30:42.009 --> 30:43.385
Do I have a choice?

30:44.136 --> 30:45.137
No.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.064
I have never met American astronaut.

30:57.608 --> 31:00.152
Tell me, how did you get in program?

31:01.069 --> 31:02.279
Are you parachutist?

31:02.863 --> 31:05.115
No. I'm a pilot.

31:06.325 --> 31:08.785
An engineer. Like you.

31:11.038 --> 31:14.958
And did you always want to go to space
ever since you were a little girl?

31:15.584 --> 31:18.295
When I was a little girl,
women weren't allowed to go to space.

31:20.589 --> 31:22.007
When I was little boy...

31:23.842 --> 31:26.553
no rockets had ever left to space.

31:26.637 --> 31:29.765
Still... I dreamed of reaching stars.

31:29.848 --> 31:32.100
Well, here we are.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.271
Hey.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.274
Are you gonna tell me
why I'm held prisoner here?

31:40.526 --> 31:41.652
This is not a prison.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.237
Sure as hell feels like one.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.452
You have never been to Soviet prison.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.289
Being in gulag...

31:55.332 --> 31:57.292
is like worst dream.

31:58.669 --> 32:02.548
Torture. Starvation. Cold.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.259
So cold.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.345
Men frozen to death.

32:09.930 --> 32:14.393
Forced to betray their comrades
in order to survive.

32:16.353 --> 32:17.479
Every day...

32:19.022 --> 32:22.484
you wonder, will you be next,
lined up against wall?

32:35.622 --> 32:37.082
To fallen comrades.

32:38.876 --> 32:40.252
You know our customs.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.379
I had a good teacher.

32:45.883 --> 32:47.259
Do you know these people?

32:49.761 --> 32:51.221
What people?

32:51.305 --> 32:52.556
The names on the door.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.521
I didn't realize those were names.

33:02.816 --> 33:03.984
Yuri Gagarin.

33:05.027 --> 33:08.864
Valentina Tereshkova. Aleksei Leonov.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.366
Anastasia Belikova.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.996
Yuri Gagarin slept in this room?

33:17.873 --> 33:20.542
We leave them there
as symbols to remember.

33:24.546 --> 33:28.467
Soviet flag on the moon.
This is symbol too.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.637
I remember in planning,

33:31.720 --> 33:35.807
we had calculation,
how close should flag be to lander.

33:35.891 --> 33:39.645
If only a meter too close,
when lander takes off, it will...

33:42.105 --> 33:47.277
Fourteen years later,
Soviet flag still stands on the moon.

33:48.195 --> 33:52.032
I know grown man
who weep in Soviet Union at that.

33:52.950 --> 33:54.952
Powerful symbol.

33:57.496 --> 34:00.707
When I first heard about Soyuz-Apollo...

34:02.334 --> 34:03.460
I thought...

34:05.838 --> 34:07.381
Ronald Reagan,

34:07.464 --> 34:09.174
he is clever man.

34:10.467 --> 34:15.097
Symbol of astronaut and cosmonaut
together in space.

34:18.684 --> 34:21.603
Of course,
I knew we had no choice but to agree,

34:21.687 --> 34:25.232
because we would look cynical
if we did not.

34:27.818 --> 34:29.069
But also...

34:30.279 --> 34:31.737
because maybe...

34:33.407 --> 34:37.286
maybe... it could change the world.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.956
It can't be anything
if I don't ever leave this room.

34:55.387 --> 34:59.349
When you finally go out this door...

35:03.020 --> 35:04.563
do it with your head up.

35:33.550 --> 35:34.885
Hello?

35:35.844 --> 35:37.971
Molly. Thank God.

35:38.055 --> 35:40.057
Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's me.

35:40.766 --> 35:45.187
No, no, no. I'm okay, I'm okay.
Yeah. I'm alone.

35:46.104 --> 35:47.314
What the hell is going on?

36:00.077 --> 36:02.204
Try a little negative pressure.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.176
Nice trick.

36:17.761 --> 36:19.555
You want something to wash that down?

36:20.889 --> 36:22.391
We got some good news.

36:22.891 --> 36:26.186
Finally reached our astronauts
in Star City. They're okay.

36:26.979 --> 36:28.188
That's great.

36:28.772 --> 36:29.773
Come on.

36:31.608 --> 36:32.985
Before I change my mind.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.541
It's brandy.

36:49.877 --> 36:50.878
I know.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.505
You do?

36:54.381 --> 36:57.968
I mean, I've never had it before, but--

37:04.308 --> 37:06.727
Asbach Uralt. Prewar.

37:07.644 --> 37:08.645
The best.

37:09.438 --> 37:10.647
It's strong.

37:16.778 --> 37:20.824
I don't think I've ever seen you this...
happy.

37:22.659 --> 37:25.537
Yeah, I am. Sometimes...

37:28.582 --> 37:30.125
people can surprise you.

37:30.209 --> 37:31.835
Restore your faith in humanity.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.546
Tell that to Bill Strausser.

37:35.631 --> 37:36.882
What's going on?

37:38.759 --> 37:40.344
He's the biggest jerk of all time.

37:40.427 --> 37:41.929
He's harmless.

37:43.305 --> 37:46.892
A lot of these guys
are lacking in social skills.

37:48.268 --> 37:51.271
Good at the work, bad with the people.

37:51.355 --> 37:52.481
Why is he like that?

37:53.106 --> 37:54.107
Bill's...

37:57.861 --> 37:59.071
complicated.

37:59.821 --> 38:03.367
He can definitely be condescending
at times and stuck in his ways, but...

38:04.117 --> 38:06.411
he's a very good engineer.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.790
And committed to his work
like no one else.

38:11.291 --> 38:14.461
Too committed sometimes.

38:15.712 --> 38:18.006
-What's that mean?
-No, nothing.

38:18.590 --> 38:19.925
There was just an...

38:21.468 --> 38:23.136
an incident a long time ago.

38:23.220 --> 38:25.305
Probably shouldn't have mentioned it.

38:25.389 --> 38:28.600
Come on. Now you have to tell me.

38:33.564 --> 38:36.775
There was a night when
he'd been at his console for 23 hours,

38:36.859 --> 38:39.570
and he refused to leave it. Refused.

38:39.653 --> 38:43.198
I guess he got caught up
in all the excitement, and he...

38:46.201 --> 38:48.078
He peed his pants.

38:48.161 --> 38:50.539
All over himself. Everything.

38:51.123 --> 38:53.000
Just... wet.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.335
Wet.

38:56.295 --> 39:00.507
After that,
people started calling him Mr. Peanut.

39:00.591 --> 39:02.509
Why Peanut?

39:02.593 --> 39:03.844
I have no idea,

39:03.927 --> 39:06.305
but that was his nickname
from that day on,

39:06.388 --> 39:09.766
and it followed him for years.

39:10.934 --> 39:11.935
Years.

39:12.728 --> 39:16.481
People would leave peanuts on his console,
peanut butter.

39:16.565 --> 39:20.277
Even a doll with a diaper on it.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.154
Jesus.

39:22.237 --> 39:23.530
I almost feel bad for him.

39:24.698 --> 39:25.699
Almost.

39:25.782 --> 39:28.410
I know. But listen.

39:29.661 --> 39:34.333
If I can find a way to
get along with Bill, so can you.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.961
You need to find a way
to work this out with him.

39:38.587 --> 39:42.799
He's not gonna be the last difficult
person you come across in your career.

39:43.592 --> 39:44.593
Yeah.

39:45.594 --> 39:46.762
You're probably right.

39:50.224 --> 39:53.602
The Soviet Union
continues to mobilize their Pacific fleet,

39:53.685 --> 39:56.813
harassing vessels that stray
near the theorized crash site

39:56.897 --> 40:02.277
and blocking attempts to search
for the remains of flight KAL 007.

40:02.361 --> 40:06.114
The United States responded by dispatching
warships from the Seventh Fleet

40:06.198 --> 40:09.076
and has put Air Command on 24-hour alert

40:09.159 --> 40:12.412
as tensions continue to rise
in the North Pacific.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.211
You have to push the button.

40:20.671 --> 40:21.880
Let me do it.

40:22.589 --> 40:23.841
Bless you.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.639
I couldn't sleep.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.225
Me neither.

40:44.236 --> 40:45.404
How you holding up?

40:48.198 --> 40:49.283
I don't know.

40:50.242 --> 40:54.288
I don't really know which--
which way is up.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.332
Everything's just so...

41:00.627 --> 41:01.712
overwhelming.

41:04.256 --> 41:05.507
And I can see what's coming.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.511
Bradford's already pushing
for the military to have a stronger hand.

41:09.595 --> 41:12.014
And that's how this slippery slope
becomes an avalanche,

41:12.097 --> 41:15.517
and we suddenly look around, and we're
a part of the Department of Defense.

41:15.601 --> 41:16.768
It happens all the time.

41:16.852 --> 41:21.857
There's a crisis, and then the military
swoops in, and they take control.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.775
It'll be the end of NASA as we know it.

41:25.569 --> 41:28.280
You can kiss Mars goodbye.
For a decade, at least.

41:28.363 --> 41:30.407
I can't let that happen.

41:30.490 --> 41:31.491
Well...

41:33.577 --> 41:34.995
what are you gonna do about it?

41:35.621 --> 41:36.830
I don't know.

41:40.250 --> 41:44.630
-Can I just point out one thing?
-Sure. Please.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.715
You're the fucking administrator of NASA.

41:46.798 --> 41:48.592
Acting administrator.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.427
So start acting like it.

41:51.553 --> 41:53.847
You're not watching
from the sidelines anymore.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.891
You're in the game, for Christ's sake.

41:55.974 --> 41:57.893
What exactly do you expect me to do?

41:57.976 --> 42:01.355
You have to prove to them
that you've got things under control.

42:02.189 --> 42:03.690
Show them how tough you are.

42:04.399 --> 42:06.026
How far you're willing to go.

42:06.652 --> 42:08.403
Then you'll have their trust.

42:13.951 --> 42:16.328
We all play different roles
with different people.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.876
Something Tom once told me.

42:36.390 --> 42:37.933
You know what this is about?

43:00.664 --> 43:03.250
The president has decided
to arm Pathfinder.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.088
-Wow.
-Just like that?

43:09.798 --> 43:11.633
We're putting missiles on a shuttle?

43:11.717 --> 43:13.844
Well, at this point
he really has no choice.

43:14.970 --> 43:17.890
The Soviets are being very provocative.
It's a defensive measure.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.183
Until it's not.

43:19.975 --> 43:23.687
We're also moving up the retaking
of lunar claim site 357 Bravo.

43:23.770 --> 43:25.981
It will happen within 48 hours.

43:27.649 --> 43:30.235
But-- What? It's still daylight up there.

43:30.319 --> 43:33.280
The whole idea
was to use the cover of lunar night

43:33.363 --> 43:35.157
to maintain the element of surprise.

43:35.240 --> 43:37.534
Not to mention, these guys
haven't finished their training.

43:38.118 --> 43:41.163
The president has been fully briefed
on where we're at with the mission

43:41.246 --> 43:43.498
and is comfortable moving forward.

43:43.582 --> 43:46.001
Ellen, can't you talk to him?
Get him to listen to reason?

43:46.084 --> 43:49.880
-He needs to understand, this is--
-These were my recommendations, Margo.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.575
Hello, Sergei.

44:18.659 --> 44:19.660
Margo.

44:21.745 --> 44:24.081
I'm going back to Soviet Union

44:24.164 --> 44:28.210
while it is decided whether Soyuz-Apollo
still is to continue.

44:28.293 --> 44:29.711
I've heard.

44:30.295 --> 44:33.549
I just wanted to say thank you
for your help.

44:35.092 --> 44:37.761
You're welcome. I'm glad to do it.

44:37.845 --> 44:39.096
And...

44:41.390 --> 44:44.977
as soon as all this gets resolved,
which I'm sure it will,

44:45.060 --> 44:48.313
I hope to see you again and continue
planning this mission together.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.859
Yes. I as well hope this.

44:59.199 --> 45:04.121
It might be a good thing
to take a step back actually.

45:04.830 --> 45:06.540
Look at things with fresh eyes.

45:06.623 --> 45:10.586
See if we're missing anything
with these docking module specs.

45:12.087 --> 45:13.964
Missing anything? What do you mean?

45:14.548 --> 45:18.427
I just keep wondering
if we've overlooked something.

45:19.344 --> 45:21.054
For instance, about a year ago,

45:21.138 --> 45:25.100
we discovered a defective component
in our shuttle design.

45:26.977 --> 45:30.105
A flaw with the O-ring seals
in the boosters.

45:33.483 --> 45:34.484
What flaw?

45:35.235 --> 45:39.781
One of our engineers discovered
that the ring would harden in cold weather

45:39.865 --> 45:41.700
and fail to seal the joints.

45:41.783 --> 45:45.621
Temperatures at Merritt Island
rarely drop below 40.

45:46.205 --> 45:50.918
So... you can understand
how we initially missed it.

45:53.003 --> 45:55.214
Yes, I can understand this.

45:56.381 --> 45:57.966
Thank God we found it.

45:58.050 --> 46:01.303
Because if temperatures
were to dip unexpectedly,

46:02.137 --> 46:06.475
there would be
a substantial risk of failure.

46:07.226 --> 46:08.977
So...

46:09.061 --> 46:15.150
I just wonder what, if anything,
we're missing with these docking specs.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.569
Yes, I wonder too.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.991
I would take a look at it
while you're away.

46:27.538 --> 46:30.541
Well... I have to go. I have a meeting.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.252
But I hope to see you again.

46:33.335 --> 46:36.046
Yes. I hope so... too.

46:57.860 --> 46:58.944
Hey, Kel.

47:00.821 --> 47:02.447
You hungry?

47:02.531 --> 47:05.325
I'm making bean sandwiches. Your favorite.

47:07.619 --> 47:09.204
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

47:11.915 --> 47:12.916
All right.

49:25.048 --> 49:26.258
Did Ashley leave?

49:26.842 --> 49:30.637
Yeah. She took off,
but she said she'd see you tomorrow.

49:30.721 --> 49:33.473
Or... I guess that's technically today.

49:36.101 --> 49:37.436
Want a beer?

49:39.354 --> 49:41.857
I shouldn't, but yes, please.

49:44.401 --> 49:46.570
Are you really outta here next week?

49:47.196 --> 49:49.448
I can't believe that
the summer's already over.

49:49.531 --> 49:51.033
I'm gonna miss you around here.

49:51.116 --> 49:52.451
To a great summer.

49:53.702 --> 49:55.245
And an even better school year.

49:56.580 --> 49:58.916
-And to you, Mrs. Baldwin.
-Danny!

49:59.666 --> 50:01.627
-Karen. Karen.
-Thank you.

50:01.710 --> 50:02.753
Sorry.

50:07.007 --> 50:08.592
So...

50:08.675 --> 50:10.260
how you feeling about everything?

50:11.136 --> 50:12.554
I mean, with selling this place.

50:17.142 --> 50:18.352
Honestly...

50:19.770 --> 50:22.898
I feel ready... to move on.

50:24.066 --> 50:26.109
Ready for a new chapter.

50:28.111 --> 50:31.031
Truth is, the place isn't mine.
It never really was.

50:33.033 --> 50:34.076
Well...

50:35.786 --> 50:38.080
then we should celebrate.

50:38.163 --> 50:40.666
Well... isn't that
what we're already doing?

50:40.749 --> 50:45.504
In honor of my last week, I decided to
donate something to the Outpost jukebox.

50:46.338 --> 50:48.131
Really? That was very thoughtful.

51:00.686 --> 51:02.563
-What is this?
-Billy Swan.

51:03.188 --> 51:04.940
-The country singer.
-Yeah.

51:08.527 --> 51:09.695
You recognize that?

51:11.154 --> 51:12.322
Yeah...

51:13.198 --> 51:14.408
No. Hold on.

51:24.042 --> 51:25.419
Oh, my goodness.

51:27.337 --> 51:29.673
Danny. Oh, no.

51:31.216 --> 51:34.761
-Isn't it great?
-Yeah, it's different.

51:59.536 --> 52:00.537
Come on.

53:56.195 --> 53:57.654
Have you been drinking?

55:18.485 --> 55:20.362
How soon can you prep and fuel the LSAM?

55:21.196 --> 55:23.407
I suppose in a few hours. Why?
What's going on?

55:24.700 --> 55:27.286
The president wants to retake the claim
at 0800 tomorrow.

55:30.455 --> 55:33.041
Jesus. Why are you telling me this?

55:34.501 --> 55:36.628
You think Charles is ready
to pilot the LSAM?

55:36.712 --> 55:40.048
No. No. Not yet.

55:42.217 --> 55:44.761
If I knew he needed
to be ready so soon, I would've--

55:44.845 --> 55:46.221
Can you do it?

55:46.305 --> 55:49.641
You've flown with us before.
You know the mission better than anyone.

55:52.853 --> 55:55.939
I can't order you to do it.
It's dangerous.

55:56.023 --> 55:57.774
We don't know for sure they
don't have weapons, and if they do--

55:57.858 --> 55:58.984
I'm in.

56:01.069 --> 56:03.530
Okay then. Prep the LSAM for launch.

56:03.614 --> 56:06.283
We gotta load our gear
and get ready to roll out in 17 hours.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.620
Yeah, let's do it.

56:16.627 --> 56:18.045
Thank you very much.

56:18.128 --> 56:21.507
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I'm proud to announce

56:21.590 --> 56:25.844
that we have reestablished contact
with two American heroes.

56:25.928 --> 56:28.847
Astronauts Danielle Poole
and Nate Morrison,

56:28.931 --> 56:31.767
who were being held in the Soviet Union

56:31.850 --> 56:35.395
after the Korean Air Line 007 disaster.

56:36.063 --> 56:39.066
Like the Americans who began this country,

56:39.149 --> 56:42.778
history has asked much
of the Americans of our own time.

56:42.861 --> 56:44.655
Much we have already given.

56:46.156 --> 56:48.742
Much more we must be prepared to give.

56:51.161 --> 56:53.205
But we also must remember

56:54.164 --> 56:57.251
the future does not belong
to the fainthearted.

56:57.793 --> 57:00.128
It belongs to the brave.

57:06.426 --> 57:11.181
One of these brave Americans,
Acting NASA Administrator Ellen Wilson,

57:11.265 --> 57:14.059
has led the effort
to bring our astronauts home.

57:14.142 --> 57:15.644
And I'm proud to announce

57:15.727 --> 57:18.981
they are currently on their way
to free soil in West Germany.

57:20.232 --> 57:23.443
Let us have faith
in Abraham Lincoln's words,

57:23.527 --> 57:25.320
"That right makes might.

57:25.863 --> 57:31.118
And in that faith, let us, to the end,
dare to do our duty as we understand it."

57:33.078 --> 57:37.457
Thank you. God bless you,
and God bless America.

57:44.089 --> 57:45.924
Fuel at 60%.

57:46.008 --> 57:47.885
Copy 60.

57:50.679 --> 57:52.931
Beginning descent to avoid radar.

57:54.057 --> 57:55.475
Forty meters.

57:57.978 --> 57:59.271
Down at seven.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.982
Dropping like a stone.

58:02.691 --> 58:04.026
Fifteen.

58:04.109 --> 58:05.485
Canyon in sight.

58:06.195 --> 58:09.531
Final approach to canyon.
Ninety seconds to drop point.

58:15.746 --> 58:18.624
Holding at five meters.
Steady at five meters.

58:18.707 --> 58:19.833
Steady.

58:19.917 --> 58:24.004
We have canyon entrance. Hang on
out there. Some tight turns coming up.

58:24.755 --> 58:27.049
All right, commencing final run.

58:27.132 --> 58:29.009
Sixty seconds to drop point.

59:08.715 --> 59:11.301
Approaching final turn. Ten seconds out.

59:16.306 --> 59:17.516
Shit.

59:18.475 --> 59:19.893
Landing site's not clear.

59:19.977 --> 59:22.104
That drilling rig wasn't on the sat map.

59:22.688 --> 59:25.983
-Should we abort?
-Negative. Going downrange.

59:31.864 --> 59:33.907
Drop point located. Begin descent.

59:33.991 --> 59:35.868
Ten meters. Down at eight.

59:35.951 --> 59:37.661
Just like the drills, folks.

59:37.744 --> 59:40.622
Immediate dismount,
clear the vehicle and form up on me.

59:40.706 --> 59:41.915
Oorah!

59:41.999 --> 59:44.668
Let's do this. Weapons free.

59:49.715 --> 59:52.384
Two meters. Kicking up a lot of dust.

59:52.467 --> 59:53.677
Hold on.

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:02.978
Tracy Stevens, you are a badass.

1:00:25.959 --> 1:00:27.211
We have the site.

1:00:27.294 --> 1:00:28.962
I repeat, we have the site.
