00:49.632 --> 00:52.552
There's something I want to know.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.553
Okay.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.640
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.482
Is she seeing anyone or not?

01:06.649 --> 01:08.193
I don't think she is.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.237
That's good.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.326
-Why are you asking me that though?
-What?

01:16.409 --> 01:19.037
Ask her directly. Why are you asking me?

01:21.039 --> 01:22.248
A, e, i, o.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.250
See? My voice's getting hoarse.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.879
What are you going on about?
It's not like it required a long answer.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.632
Aren't we here to discuss the contract?

01:30.715 --> 01:32.675
Don't you dare go back on your word

01:32.759 --> 01:34.135
and trick me in any way.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.721
"In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!"

01:36.805 --> 01:38.223
What's gotten into you?

01:42.685 --> 01:44.687
-Hello.
-Hi. Chief Hong, you're here too.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.815
We're done here,
so I was just about to leave.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.691
Where are you off to?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.902
What's with all the questions today?

01:50.985 --> 01:52.779
Don't ask, all right?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.659
-What's gotten into him?
-Did you fight?

01:57.742 --> 01:59.452
It's nothing. Have a seat, guys.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.998
We came to a great agreement.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.168
Chun-jae, can we get a refill
on the popcorn?

02:07.669 --> 02:10.630
Are you trying to
fill yourself up with these?

02:11.297 --> 02:14.217
-Order some food--
-It's just that delicious.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.344
-We're only here for a glass.
-Have it all.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.638
There aren't any customers,
so sit with us.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.390
-I was just about to.
-Good.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.267
That reminds me.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.893
-Have you seen it?
-Seen what?

02:23.977 --> 02:27.730
The blue dress I love.
The one with the floral print.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.191
Oh, that? I haven't seen it.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.651
That's weird.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.654
I hung it out to dry after washing it,
but it's gone.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.282
Maybe it flew away.
It's been windy these days.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.283
-You think so?
-Yes.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.327
-One of my stuff is missing too.
-What is it?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.871
My red bra.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.540
-Seriously?
-Come on!

02:45.623 --> 02:47.041
-Nam-suk!
-I almost pictured it.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.460
-The colorâ€¦
-Who would steal that crap?

02:49.544 --> 02:52.046
It's not crap. It's my underwear!

02:52.130 --> 02:56.134
You'll give me yet another bruise.
You're turning me into a dalmatian.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.927
No, a zebra.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.554
Guys, that's enough.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.056
Say that to her.
She's the one who's hitting me.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.435
By the way, how's the tooth
you got treated for nerve pain?

03:05.518 --> 03:09.022
It hurts. My heart aches due to the cost.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.983
Still, I hear Dr. Yoon
is quite the skilled dentist.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.235
-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes?

03:14.319 --> 03:17.280
Don't you think there's something
between her and Director Ji?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.865
-Really?
-Not this again.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.325
I heard they're old friends.

03:20.408 --> 03:23.411
Gosh. Listen to this innocent soul.

03:23.494 --> 03:28.291
Dr. Yoon slept with Chief Hong
but also hooks up with Director Ji.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.127
That's true talent if you ask me.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.630
And in my eyes, the men could do better.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.715
-That's ridiculous.
-Nam-suk!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.926
How could you say that?

03:38.009 --> 03:40.094
Goodness, Ms. Pyo. When did you get here?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.430
-Just now.
-Right.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.098
Anyway, Hye-jin's not like that.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.309
She's famous for
not living up to her beauty,

03:46.392 --> 03:48.645
so why are you spreading such rumors?

03:48.728 --> 03:51.648
There's no need
to get so serious about it.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.609
I'm just telling them
what I saw with my eyes.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.945
I'm not spreading rumors online,

03:57.028 --> 03:59.280
-so why--
-What can I get you, Ms. Pyo?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.824
Some coffee or some fried chicken?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.993
-What do you have?
-Just name it.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.662
I only stated the facts.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.456
-Can't one speak freely?
-You didn't make a sound coming in.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.416
She must know Dr. Yoon slept out.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.753
-That's enough.
-Guys, cut the gossip and leave.

04:13.836 --> 04:14.671
Right, sure.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.550
A cola for Ju-ri,

04:20.802 --> 04:24.514
milk for Bo-ra, and green tea for I-jun.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.976
What the hell? This isn't diet cola.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.686
Don't you have strawberry milk?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.562
Thank you, ma'am.

04:31.646 --> 04:35.024
Why on earth are you kids
in my house though?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.860
Because you have a bigger and better TV.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
So I can see my JUNE even clearer.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.240
Hye-jin, can you move over?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.742
-You're blocking the TV. Move.
-Sorry about that.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.454
And we're here to see the hedgehog.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.250
I apologize for interrupting
and ruining your Sunday.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.129
Dr. Yoon, we named it.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.840
Please call it "Seumseum" from now on.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.301
But this hedgehog--

05:01.384 --> 05:03.720
Seumseum. That's its name.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.432
Right, Seumseum.
When will you take it home with you?

05:12.937 --> 05:15.356
Hi, everyone.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.235
So, did you start up a kids' cafe?

05:20.361 --> 05:23.031
I should've pretended to be out
when they rang the bell.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.242
The lack of caffeine in me
led to this miscalculation.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.663
Hey, I just met Ms. Cho
at the coffee shop.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.207
What the hell's her problem?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.876
What did she say?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.754
She said you slept with Chief Hong--

05:44.969 --> 05:48.848
She was telling others
that you slept with Chief Hong

05:48.931 --> 05:52.643
and now are two-timing him
with Ji Seong-hyeon. She's so annoying.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.731
It doesn't surprise me.
That's so typical of her, it bores me.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.610
-Aren't you pissed?
-Over something like that?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.320
Besides, she's my patient.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.406
They said the men could do better.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.825
-Who could do better?
-The men.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.993
The "men"?

06:09.952 --> 06:11.704
-Who said that?
-All of them.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.498
Tell me who.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.209
Just everyone.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.171
Aren't we supposed to go in the water?

06:20.254 --> 06:23.466
Did they give you a camera
the second you got a job as a director?

06:23.549 --> 06:25.968
That's a perfect analogy. Very convincing.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.637
I never say what's wrong.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.430
Must he do it himself?

06:30.056 --> 06:32.391
So that he can have others do it too.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.978
Surfing is very similar to life.

06:36.062 --> 06:40.358
If a good wave comes along,
you ride it and slide off it gently.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.903
Whether the waves are vicious or stagnant,
accept it as is.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.114
That's philosophical. It suits me well.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.907
I can say it surely doesn't.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.701
It's just like I said before.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.286
-Lift your upper body
-Right.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.205
-and look ahead.
-Right.

06:54.288 --> 06:58.209
Here comes a wave, start paddling.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.169
Lift your chest more and push.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.756
Now, we take off.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.759
Draw your left leg closer to your chest.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.845
Slowly stand up while looking ahead.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.264
-Hold on a second.
-Look straight ahead.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.431
What theâ€¦

07:14.767 --> 07:17.103
-Again. Paddle.
-Paddle.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.396
Paddle and push.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.815
Left leg at your chest.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.860
That's it. Now keep your balance.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.612
-Is this the best you can do?
-This is me at 99 percent.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.532
-I must not have the talent.
-Stop talking and try again.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.200
Look straight ahead.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.787
For three seconds,
shout at the top of your lungs!

07:36.873 --> 07:38.458
Good. Down on the board!

07:38.541 --> 07:42.211
Why does it seem like he's being hazed?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.504
Here we go. Eyes forward.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.423
-It's like being back at boot camp.
-Chest up.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.799
Look ahead!

07:46.883 --> 07:48.259
It seems he has a grudge.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.719
Now, push.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.285
Once more. I can do it this time.

08:29.842 --> 08:34.305
Is he filming
an apocalyptic disaster film?

08:34.388 --> 08:37.308
What are you talking about? It's a comedy.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.727
One with a sad ending.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.563
-I can do this.
-Can't you swim?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.023
I never learned.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.005
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

09:08.089 --> 09:10.383
I should've taken a different path.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.134
Damn this habit of mine.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.055
You must've seen a doctor.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.974
Was any clinic open today?

09:18.057 --> 09:22.770
Yes, an orthopedist in Jinseon-dong
was open, so I went there.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.814
So? Did he say you're fine?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.732
Only because I have strong bones.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.694
They said most people
would've cracked their bones.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.654
I never guessed otherwise.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.740
Your skull hasn't split open
from the fall.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.661
You and your harsh choice of words.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.163
Even the harshest sandpaper
would be less gritty.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.165
Leave before I grind you down.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.336
Wait.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.216
Could we talk? I have something to say.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.968
-You can come in.
-No.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.179
Not in there, but somewhere else.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.651
Say what you need to say.
It's hot outside.

10:13.988 --> 10:14.989
Hwa-jeong.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.995
Our relationship as a married couple
might have ended,

10:22.079 --> 10:23.831
but we're still old friends.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.543
It must be something serious,
considering that grand opening.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.297
You're probably aware
of my past feelings for Cho-hui.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.426
I thought about it a lot,

10:37.345 --> 10:39.597
and I don't want to lose her
this time around.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.768
I'm planning to tell her how I feel.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.313
-I thought you should know first--
-Not her.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.109
-Why not?
-Just know that she's off-limits.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.320
-Why not?
-Because you can't.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.572
Give me a reason why you're against it.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.575
I'm just saying you can't,
so why do you need a reason?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.661
Do you have memories
of your past life or something?

11:01.744 --> 11:02.787
What do you mean?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.373
Did I wrong you in some past life?

11:05.456 --> 11:07.208
Are you avenging your family?

11:07.291 --> 11:11.462
If not, whyâ€¦ Why are you doing this to me?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.339
I meanâ€¦

11:14.006 --> 11:15.925
What did I do that's so wrong?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.761
I married you because you wanted to,

11:18.844 --> 11:22.223
and divorced you as you wanted.

11:22.306 --> 11:26.977
What did I ever do
for you to ruin my life?

11:27.061 --> 11:30.773
Hey, Hwa-jeong! Wait!

11:30.856 --> 11:34.110
Fine, just leave. Cho-hui and I will--

11:37.196 --> 11:40.324
I'll have a good life with Cho-hui,

11:40.908 --> 11:45.830
so serve us a free bottle of soju
when we go to your restaurant on a date.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.464
I had a blast.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.341
It was tricky but I want to try again.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.676
Do it on your own.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.928
I've had it with anything
that starts with an S.

12:02.138 --> 12:06.600
Spaghetti, <i>samseon jjajangmyeon</i>,
Sichuan-style noodle soup, fried shrimps.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.810
-What are you doing?
-Sâ€¦

12:09.186 --> 12:10.312
What's for dinner?

12:10.396 --> 12:13.899
Someone this childish is the nation's
top TV variety show director?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.110
The future of Korean TV shows is bright.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.988
Hey, I know what I want. <i>Mul-naengmyeon</i>.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.948
Even after drinking all that seawater?

12:21.031 --> 12:22.408
Have it by yourself.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
But it's an essential summer dish!

12:24.452 --> 12:25.619
It's still a no.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.455
-Let's have it.
-No.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.415
-Youâ€¦
-Seong-hyeon?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.003
-Hello.
-Hey, Hye-jin. Where are you off to?

12:34.086 --> 12:36.922
-We're on our way to get dinner.
-I see.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.050
-Thanks for the brunch, Seong-hyeon.
-Sure.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.595
I enjoyed it too. Thank you.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.346
Did you say "brunch"?

12:45.014 --> 12:47.016
-Hey, Chief Hong.
-Hi.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.560
He delivered brunch to us himself
this morning.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.188
Bread and heavy butter for breakfast?

12:52.771 --> 12:55.191
Koreans should have rice
and a hot bowl of soup.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.985
Do you not know
how bad that is for your health?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.987
-She's right.
-It's high in sodium

13:00.070 --> 13:01.614
and bad for your digestive system.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.533
I guess you'll live
a long and healthy life.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.535
Yes, that's my ultimate goal.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.704
-What theâ€¦
-Okay, that's enough.

13:08.787 --> 13:09.872
So what are you having?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.957
We're going to have <i>naengmyeon</i>

13:12.041 --> 13:13.626
-since it's so hot.
-Really?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.961
-I was about to go for some myself.
-Really?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.963
-Can I join you?
-Sounds good.

13:18.047 --> 13:23.636
Wait, that reminds me. I've gained
so much weight recently, haven't I?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.138
So I was planning
to go on a diet, you see.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.225
-Don't be ridiculous. What weight?
-I've gained tons.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.602
They say you should
strike the iron while hot,

13:31.685 --> 13:33.312
so today will be day one.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.398
So go without me.
Go enjoy it, the two of you.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.651
Have a fun time, all right?

13:39.610 --> 13:41.195
What's with her?

13:41.278 --> 13:42.905
-So it'll be just us two?
-Sure.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.782
Why is it just you? I'm here too.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.116
You didn't want <i>naengmyeon</i>.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.952
I was against <i>mul-naengmyeon</i>.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.912
<i>Bibim-naengmyeon</i> is the way to go.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.206
Let's go. I'll lead the way.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.417
Follow my lead. I know a decent place.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.127
-Come on.
-Gosh.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.088
-Let's go.
-Sure.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.092
-They serve a mean <i>mul-naengmyeon</i> here.
-Really?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.636
-<i>Bibim-naengmyeon</i> is good too.
-Right.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.770
It's so hot.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.148
I can't wait.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.407
Mr. Ji, you love conquering
the menu alone.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.158
Go ahead. We'll share this one.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.037
Right. Read that one yourself.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.539
We'll share this one.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.082
Here.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.585
-All right.
-Let's see.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.295
<i>She said "we."</i>

14:39.378 --> 14:41.881
-Why don't we order dumplings too?
-Sounds good.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.924
How many? Two plates?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.551
Two plates?

14:47.344 --> 14:48.971
How many should we order?

14:49.054 --> 14:50.431
Wellâ€¦

14:51.640 --> 14:52.766
I'm good with anything.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.852
"Anything"? We asked how many.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.645
Let's go with three.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.156
Aren't three plates too many?

15:07.239 --> 15:11.619
There's no need to worry about that.
He'll probably clear all our plates.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.873
Then go ahead and have some more.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.790
What?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.084
I can't eat all these.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.631
Are you sure you can give me this many?

15:23.714 --> 15:28.469
Of course. Just watching you eat
is satisfying enough.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.225
Have one more.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.352
That's for me.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.313
I had dibs on it, you see.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.523
What on earth are you doing?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.984
What was that?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.819
Why did you do that?

15:47.571 --> 15:49.490
It's just that hers seemed bigger.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.868
Don't tell me you hog food too.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.083
Look at you working so hard.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.795
Why aren't you preparing
for the dinner rush?

16:02.878 --> 16:04.588
Everything is prepped.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.926
I heard you met with Yu Cho-hui
at a restaurant the other day.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.053
What did you two do?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.681
I hope you didn't clobber her like this

16:13.764 --> 16:15.349
or spray salt on her.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.017
-Is it raining?
-What?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.979
It's great weather today.
Hardly a speck of dust.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.313
-That's too bad.
-What?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.357
You should still get a beating though.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.317
-What are you doing?
-Get over here!

16:25.985 --> 16:28.112
-What's wrong?
-I have a cramp right here.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.071
-A cramp?
-Yes.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.698
-Out of the blue? Where?
-Yes.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.075
-Right here.
-Here?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.493
Are you nuts?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.954
-Goodness me.
-Get out of here.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.706
You and your foul temper!

16:38.789 --> 16:41.667
-Stop hitting me. It really hurts!
-Leave!

16:41.750 --> 16:43.419
-Goodness.
-Hello.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.963
Hey. It's you.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.172
Hi, Cho-hui.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.799
-Go on in.
-Right.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.009
Don't mind me.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.220
Hwa-jeong, could you spare me some time?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.848
Sure thing. Come on in.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.849
Thanks.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.684
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

16:58.767 --> 17:01.186
I'm a little busy. What's it about?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.271
Well,

17:03.814 --> 17:05.274
I came to give you this.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.862
I bought a set for you
while buying cosmetics for myself.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.155
It reduces wrinkles.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.282
Why are you giving me this?

17:13.949 --> 17:17.036
Do I seem to have too many wrinkles?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.912
No, it's not like that.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.541
I found it to be effective,
so I wanted you to try it too.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.045
Cho-hui,

17:27.755 --> 17:30.924
I don't want
to use the same cosmetics as you

17:31.008 --> 17:32.634
or spend time with you.

17:34.011 --> 17:34.928
Sorry?

17:35.012 --> 17:39.308
You wanted the three of us
to be good friends like before,

17:39.391 --> 17:40.684
but I can't.

17:41.685 --> 17:46.398
How can I be
when Yeong-guk and I are divorced?

17:49.568 --> 17:53.280
You see, my life isn't
going well enough to play along

17:53.363 --> 17:55.783
with your childish requests.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.330
I'm sorry, Hwa-jeong.
It was inconsiderate of me.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.291
Ms. Yu,

18:05.876 --> 18:08.837
please don't come by
unannounced like this again.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.759
People don't appreciate teachers
meeting certain parents separately.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.016
I'm sorry, ma'am. It was careless of me.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.466
I had no idea you'd go into variety shows.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.718
I thought you'd become a reporter.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.804
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.889
When I interviewed for the newsroom,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.725
they said my voice was good enough
to be an anchor,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.102
so I became one.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.019
An anchorman?

19:06.645 --> 19:10.232
You have no idea
how popular Seong-hyeon was.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.278
Girls would sit around the campus lawn
just to get a glimpse of him

19:14.361 --> 19:16.029
-and hear his voice.
-Godâ€¦

19:16.113 --> 19:19.199
-He was that popular.
-Talk about blowing it out of proportion.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.284
It's true.

19:20.909 --> 19:24.371
Not you though, Hye-jin.
You were always so busy.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.915
You were busy? Why?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.168
To earn my tuition,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.753
I had several part-time jobs
and tutoring gigs.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.091
You were busy when we first met
in the lecture room.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.260
-Do you remember that?
-Of course.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.763
You sure have a good memory.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.310
How did you two first meet?

19:51.064 --> 19:52.774
Excuse me.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.695
Are you Yoon Hye-jin, the dental major?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.030
Yes, that's me.

19:58.822 --> 19:59.656
I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.659
Hello.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.580
We're on the same group presentation,
so why don't we talk about it over dinner?

20:06.663 --> 20:11.501
I'm really sorry about this,
but I have a student to tutor.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.878
Just a second.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.801
Here's my number.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.597
Let me know what I should do,
and I'll get it done.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.932
Then when do you eat?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.684
How can you work on an empty stomach?

20:27.768 --> 20:28.852
My dinner?

20:29.978 --> 20:30.896
It's here.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.107
This. My dinner.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.070
Can you survive on that?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.738
Sure. It's more than enough.

20:41.949 --> 20:42.866
Hold on a second.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.789
Here.

20:55.045 --> 20:55.879
Let's swap.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.674
No, it's fine. Wait.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.926
I'll enjoy this.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.847
-But--
-I'll be in touch.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.226
Wait. Hold on a second.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.103
Bye!

21:16.733 --> 21:21.321
<i>Come to think of it,
you took meals seriously even back then.</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:24.157
How was I supposed to do nothing
when a junior student said

21:24.241 --> 21:27.035
that one sausage was her dinner?
I had to give you what I had.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.039
For a second,
I thought you had Mary Poppins' magic bag.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.250
Food kept coming out of it.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.459
What was it again?

21:34.543 --> 21:37.045
You had a sausage and Iâ€¦

21:37.129 --> 21:38.755
-A fish cake bar?
-No, not that.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.549
A sandwich. What the hell?

21:40.632 --> 21:41.967
-Gosh.
-Are you all right?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.677
-Chief Hong, come on.
-Are you okay?

21:43.760 --> 21:44.970
-Whatâ€¦
-Watch it, will you?

21:45.053 --> 21:47.222
-I was trying to pour you some water.
-Jeez.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.600
I didn't mean to, you know.
Don't be like that.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.894
Jeez.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.980
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.528
I was hoping to get the bill this time.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.697
You can't buy two meals in one day.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.825
Buying a meal for a junior
makes the senior proud.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.535
Don't take that away from me.

22:08.618 --> 22:09.911
-Unbelievable.
-Here.

22:09.995 --> 22:10.871
What's this?

22:10.954 --> 22:13.874
For <i>naengmyeon</i> and dumplings.
And I ate one of her six dumplings,

22:13.957 --> 22:15.876
so in total, it's 13,000 won.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.003
It's fine. Just call it my treat.

22:18.086 --> 22:21.173
Forget it. Why would I let you pay
when you're not my senior?

22:21.256 --> 22:24.926
Repay me with a meal then.
It seems cold to go Dutch like this.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.554
Thinking so is a strong prejudice.

22:27.637 --> 22:31.349
He's right. You should respect his ways.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.728
Okay, fine. I'll accept it. Goshâ€¦

22:34.811 --> 22:36.730
I'll get going then. See you.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.277
-Shall we?
-He has weird taste in women.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.321
How can he see her as a woman?

22:44.404 --> 22:46.364
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

22:46.448 --> 22:48.575
Your treatment ended well today.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.077
Since the filling could break,

22:50.160 --> 22:53.246
we'll use a gold inlay
as I suggested last time.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.706
So we'll get a mold today.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.124
Dr. Yoon, hold on.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.460
I'd rather just leave it as is.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.503
Sorry?

22:59.586 --> 23:04.049
You don't have to give me
that gold thingy.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.969
Are you saying you want to skip the inlay?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.137
That's right.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.265
I drilled into the tooth
so the inside is exposed.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.683
There'll be an acute pain.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.520
It's okay. I can manage the pain myself.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.105
-But--
-So,

23:18.188 --> 23:21.024
I just have to pay
for the treatment up until today, right?

23:23.652 --> 23:25.612
Thank you, doctor.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.863
Thank you.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.367
-What?
-Ms. Pyo, I'd like to pay my bill, please.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.167
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.804
It seems like she found a dentist
who offered a cheaper procedure.

23:50.887 --> 23:54.307
I've met my fair share of weird patients,

23:54.391 --> 23:55.767
but she's a first.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.395
What a cheapskate.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.731
She has never once given us
free fried dumplings

24:01.815 --> 24:04.484
-when we ordered <i>tangsuyuk</i>.
-Right.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.527
That's not all.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.573
The other day, she took
all our complimentary coffee packets.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.534
I was wondering why
you were drinking so much coffee.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.035
Of course, it wasn't me.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.704
She's the worst.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.291
Am I really allowed
to get all this free coffee though?

24:19.374 --> 24:21.668
Of course. You're a VIP customer.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.379
But I don't feel like I'm one.

24:24.462 --> 24:28.175
The low interest makes me sad
whenever I check my bank account.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.094
Speaking of which,
could you give me a heads-up

24:31.928 --> 24:34.264
when a high-interest savings plan
comes out?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.682
You promised.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.976
Thank you. I'll hold you to that.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.060
Have a good day.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.438
Yun-gyeong, wait!

24:41.521 --> 24:44.816
You can't lift these when you're
this far along. You should've called me.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.526
But it'sâ€¦

24:47.652 --> 24:50.280
-Head inside and I'll carry them.
-It's all right.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.657
How were you going
to manage this yourself?

24:53.241 --> 24:54.701
Gosh, these are heavy.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.621
-Hey, Chief Hong.
-Hey, Director Ji.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.081
I was passing by
when I saw her with these.

25:00.165 --> 25:04.002
It's all right. I've got it from here,
so get going. You're a busy man.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.462
I have enough time for this.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.671
I'll get it done.

25:06.755 --> 25:11.426
It's fine. Director Ji
offered to help first,

25:11.509 --> 25:13.386
so I'll call if I need extra help.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.304
What?

25:15.180 --> 25:16.473
Where do these go?

25:16.556 --> 25:18.099
Those go in the fridge.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.268
-That way.
-Got it.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.479
-See you!
-Right.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.529
Whatâ€¦

25:32.489 --> 25:33.365
Jeez.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.458
What delicious treat
are you guys enjoying?

25:43.541 --> 25:47.337
That TV show director bought this for us.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.047
What are they called again?

25:49.130 --> 25:51.132
-Canola?
-The TV show director?

25:51.216 --> 25:54.761
How could you have such a bad memory
when you are years my junior?

25:54.844 --> 25:58.598
These are Ã©clairs while these are canelÃ©s.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.225
Who cares what they're called

26:00.308 --> 26:02.852
-as long as they're delicious?
-Director Ji again?

26:02.936 --> 26:07.232
He sure has been busy
showing up all over this town.

26:07.857 --> 26:11.486
What is he, Hong Gildong?
I'm the Hong in this town.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.870
Ms. Gam-ri, what's with that bundle?

26:21.371 --> 26:26.710
I agreed to rent out my house
for a whole month.

26:26.793 --> 26:31.006
Those coming and going
would feel uncomfortable if I stay.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.717
Do you have a place to stay for the month?

26:34.926 --> 26:36.845
-Wellâ€¦
-Stay at my place.

26:37.637 --> 26:41.725
As if I would put out a grown young man.

26:42.559 --> 26:46.438
I have many offering me a room.

26:49.357 --> 26:53.278
-Hold on. Can you follow me for a second?
-Why?

26:53.361 --> 26:57.699
My suitcase is on a high shelf,
so I can't get it down.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.869
Really? Let me. Is it in the other room?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.203
-Yes.
-Okay.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.663
I need your help.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.836
She should stay with you.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.339
No way. You're better friends with her.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.300
You have it all wrong.
She prefers you, you know.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.761
-No, she prefers you.
-No, it's you.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.471
It sure was on a high shelf.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.516
-She can stay with me.
-No, she'll stay with me.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.894
-She can come to my place.
-Are you kidding me?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.521
-She'll stay with me.
-Come on!

27:28.605 --> 27:32.275
-She can stay with me.
-Since you're this willing,

27:32.359 --> 27:34.736
I have no choice but to give up.

27:35.528 --> 27:39.783
Hold on a second.
This is some tough competition.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.328
How about we play a game for it?

27:43.411 --> 27:44.412
All right.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.874
Here we go.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.168
You all know the rules.

27:50.251 --> 27:54.714
The one with the highest card
will offer Ms. Gam-ri a room. Okay?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.301
All right. Take your pick.

27:58.968 --> 28:00.136
This one.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.348
This is what I call cut-throat.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.101
That's nice to see.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.311
Drum roll, please. Show us!

28:08.395 --> 28:10.688
-Here.
-There you go!

28:10.772 --> 28:12.816
-You won.
-Yours is four while yours is five.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.902
Ms. Mat-i, congratulations.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.071
It's too bad that I lost.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.991
Lucky you, Mat-i.
It'll be nice to have fun with her.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.454
When we leave later,

28:26.538 --> 28:29.916
make sure you carry my bags with you.
There's a lot of stuff.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.919
-Sure.
-Ms. Gam-ri, you're one lucky lady.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.463
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.678
Look at you.

28:42.178 --> 28:45.181
Why are you here during office hours?
What about your patients?

28:45.265 --> 28:47.559
-I have some time before my next one.
-I see.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.562
Are you a cashier today?

28:50.645 --> 28:53.231
I'll be retiring at exactly 17:00.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.082
-Why are you putting that to the side?
-Eating this

29:11.166 --> 29:13.209
will shatter your dream of longevity.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.962
-As if you care.
-Credit card, please.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.466
What's that around your neck?

29:19.549 --> 29:22.552
A neck brace.
It helps with my herniated neck.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.389
I can't believe I left this on.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.457
Get on with it then.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.251
-What?
-My card and receipt.

29:55.835 --> 29:56.753
Sure.

29:58.546 --> 29:59.547
Here.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.134
A herniated neck?

30:03.218 --> 30:05.094
It comes with the job.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.555
I look down into people's mouths all day,

30:07.639 --> 30:09.557
so how can I not have a sore neck?

30:10.391 --> 30:12.393
I bet you thought I had it easy.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.562
When did I ever imply that?

30:14.646 --> 30:18.358
My vision is getting worse,
and I deal with chemicals all day.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.819
It's got its own hardships. See you.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.244
What's wrong with me?

30:30.078 --> 30:31.579
Get a grip, Du-sik.

30:33.957 --> 30:34.958
Darn it.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.125
A neck brace.
It helps with my herniated neck.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.259
Why'd I ask? Now it's on my mind.

31:31.931 --> 31:35.268
Ding-dong.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.811
What brings you by at this hour?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.731
What's with all the pieces of wood?

31:39.814 --> 31:42.358
What's that,
a cutter used to behead people?

31:42.442 --> 31:44.235
That's not even funny.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.988
So tell me. What are these for?

31:47.071 --> 31:48.531
Tell me why you're here.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.285
Seeking shelter. I can't go home
until Yun-gyeong's asleep.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.369
What is it this time?

31:53.453 --> 31:58.041
She suddenly started craving durian
we had in Thailand on our honeymoon.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.376
She told me to get some at this hour.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.755
Why would she crave
that stinky fruit anyway?

32:03.838 --> 32:06.424
The child she bears
is the one who wants it.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.675
I know that.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.428
That's what scares me more.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.805
What if the kid is worse than Bo-ra?

32:12.889 --> 32:14.515
What? Bo-ra is adorable.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.767
Then raise her yourself.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.894
-That attitude of yours--
-That reminds me.

32:17.977 --> 32:21.356
The POS crashed again.
Maybe it's time for a new one.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.482
Why didn't you call me?

32:22.565 --> 32:25.526
Director Ji saw it while passing by
and fixed it.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.111
-What?
-Being a TV show director

32:27.195 --> 32:28.488
must've made him tech-savvy.

32:28.571 --> 32:31.783
You idiot. You should've called me.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.577
But you make me pay. He did it for free.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.791
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

33:21.874 --> 33:23.793
Who do you think you're taking?

33:23.876 --> 33:25.211
How dare you touch her!

33:25.795 --> 33:26.754
Damn bastard!

33:28.715 --> 33:31.259
My gosh. Cho-hui.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.468
Are you all right?

33:33.136 --> 33:35.680
Cho-hui? My goodness.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.808
Cho-hui, it's Hwa-jeong. Open your eyes.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.998
-My goodness.
-Is that true?

34:02.081 --> 34:04.333
-What a sick bastard.
-Hello, everyone!

34:04.417 --> 34:05.752
Yes, hello.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.545
What are you all doing here?

34:07.628 --> 34:09.797
-Did you hear the news?
-What news?

34:09.881 --> 34:12.592
-Something terrible happened last night.
-What?

34:12.675 --> 34:16.804
Ms. Yu Cho-hui was almost
abducted by a man last night.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.181
What?

34:18.264 --> 34:19.432
It's true.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.478
Is she all right?

34:33.112 --> 34:34.238
Hwa-jeong.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.741
You're awake.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.662
What happened?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.165
Why am I in the hospital?

34:44.248 --> 34:47.877
How could you drink to the point
you can't walk properly?

34:47.960 --> 34:51.089
Some sick bastard
almost took you last night.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.548
What if I didn't walk by?

34:52.632 --> 34:55.593
Are you saying you saved me?

34:56.803 --> 34:59.305
Cho-hui!

34:59.931 --> 35:04.393
Cho-hui, are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

35:04.477 --> 35:07.230
I almost lost it when I heard the news.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.815
-Yeong-guk.
-That's right.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.818
I'm Yeong-guk. It's me.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.196
The test result came out,
and she only has a mild concussion.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.199
The doctor will be here to see her soon.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.534
Right. Is that so?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.661
Since you're here, I should go.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.995
I have a restaurant to run.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.872
Yes, you're busy. Get going.

35:24.956 --> 35:25.957
Hwa-jeong,

35:27.416 --> 35:29.836
-thank you.
-Sure. Rest up.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.589
Cho-hui, let me see you.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.882
-Can you see well?
-Yes.

35:34.966 --> 35:35.967
My gosh.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.265
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

35:42.348 --> 35:46.727
You want the nerve pain treated,
but you don't want a dental crown?

35:47.395 --> 35:48.729
That's right.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.606
-Why's that?
-Sorry?

35:50.690 --> 35:56.028
You're not the first patient who wants
to skip the inlay or crown.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.406
May I ask you the reason?

35:58.489 --> 36:00.283
Wellâ€¦

36:00.867 --> 36:03.202
Gosh, I'm not supposed to say.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.628
-Ju-ri!
-Ms. Cho!

36:12.712 --> 36:16.507
Why is my sweet Ju-ri all upset?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.843
-Did you argue with your dad?
-No, it's not that.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.137
A new DOS fan merchandise
has been released,

36:21.220 --> 36:23.181
but my dad won't give me more allowance.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.974
Is that so?

36:25.057 --> 36:28.477
You got the photo cards and phone holder
before. What's the new release?

36:28.561 --> 36:30.813
A t-shirt with an embroidery
that spells "Hacker."

36:30.897 --> 36:35.526
It comes in four colors,
red, yellow, black, and white.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.528
-Four in total?
-Yes!

36:37.612 --> 36:39.780
-Then you should at least get one.
-Right?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.033
Ta-da!

36:42.116 --> 36:44.410
You're the best.
I'll place an order right away.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.121
Get the red one. It looks best on you.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.414
You're the best.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.458
-Your dad can't know about this.
-Okay.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.460
But promise me one thing.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.879
Just name it and consider it done.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.131
-You heard about Ms. Yu, right?
-Yes.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.425
Don't you wander alone late at night.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.803
Call me if you ever stay out late,
and I'll pick you up.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.264
You're the best!

37:05.348 --> 37:06.432
My sweet little puppy.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.809
-Ms. Cho.
-Yes?

37:10.436 --> 37:11.479
Did you call me?

37:11.562 --> 37:13.314
I've run out of patience.

37:14.482 --> 37:18.903
Even though I was offended by the rumors
you spread, I let it slide.

37:18.986 --> 37:22.907
But not this. How could you do this to me?

37:22.990 --> 37:27.578
Why on earth are you biting my head off
when I did nothing wrong?

37:27.662 --> 37:29.830
Tell me what this is about at least.

37:30.414 --> 37:33.834
You introduced my patients
to a dental technician you know.

37:33.918 --> 37:34.961
A dental technician?

37:35.044 --> 37:38.422
You told them
to get their cavities treated at my clinic

37:38.506 --> 37:41.384
and go to the technician
to get them filled at a lower price.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.426
Well, that's--

37:42.510 --> 37:45.429
It's an illegal,
unlicensed medical activity.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.682
How could you expose my patients to that?

37:47.765 --> 37:49.433
Gosh, Ju-ri.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.894
-You should head home.
-Yes, to buy this.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.355
-I'll see you around.
-The grown-ups need to talk.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.439
Bye.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.194
Dr. Yoon, what do you mean it's illegal?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.780
Let's face it.
The only difference is the dental degree.

38:02.863 --> 38:06.033
It's not like dentistry
requires some great skill.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.285
What did you just say?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.245
I heard it all, you know.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.747
The mold you create
is taken to a dental technician

38:11.831 --> 38:13.874
who makes it for you and brings it over.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.712
All you do is stick it on,
but you charge so much.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.838
Just stick it on?

38:18.921 --> 38:21.757
When any inlay or crown is fitted,

38:21.841 --> 38:23.968
it shouldn't affect the bite.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.762
Ensuring that is key
when it comes to fillings.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.347
Whatever.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.393
Everyone in the neighborhood
knows all dentists are frauds.

38:32.476 --> 38:35.271
Why else would they have listened to me?

38:35.354 --> 38:38.941
It's excessively pricey,
and you haven't earned their trust.

38:39.025 --> 38:43.237
What you just said is
an insult to my profession.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.739
Apologize right now.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.033
Apologize right now.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.659
-I--
-Say you're sorry.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.202
-Du-sik?
-I heard it all

38:50.286 --> 38:51.537
and you crossed the line.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.830
What?

38:52.913 --> 38:57.043
How would you feel if Ms. Dentist
badmouthed all Chinese restaurants?

38:57.126 --> 39:00.212
Come on, Du-sik.
How could you immediately take her side

39:00.296 --> 39:01.922
without knowing the full story?

39:02.006 --> 39:04.216
-I wasn't--
-That's what you just did.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.677
Is it because you twoâ€¦

39:06.761 --> 39:09.513
You've known me
much longer than her, but youâ€¦

39:10.181 --> 39:12.558
Forget it. I won't apologize.

39:12.641 --> 39:15.311
Do whatever you want. I'm just so upset.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.604
Why are you crying--

39:17.146 --> 39:18.481
Darn it.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.358
There was no need to be so harsh.

39:24.779 --> 39:29.575
I know the character is supposed
to lounge around and have fun all day,

39:29.658 --> 39:32.870
but doing some work brings the fun.
Like diving to catch fish.

39:32.953 --> 39:33.788
Right.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.376
Director Ji?

39:38.459 --> 39:39.794
-What?
-What's up?

39:39.877 --> 39:41.420
-Why weren't you listening?
-I was.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.589
His mind seems to be elsewhere.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.885
And why do you keep fidgeting
with the stuffed llama? It'll get dirty.

39:47.968 --> 39:50.096
What? When did I do that?

39:50.971 --> 39:54.975
The whole neighborhood is unsettled today.
So much for shooting in a good mood.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.853
Tell me about it. An attempted abduction?

39:58.437 --> 40:01.023
Ladies living alone must be terrified.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.608
Of course.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.529
We hear about women
being victims of crimes almost every day.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.115
So what now?

40:09.198 --> 40:11.784
How about an early dinner and a break?

40:13.577 --> 40:14.870
Sounds great.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.831
-What was that?
-Jeez.

40:16.914 --> 40:17.915
Enjoy your break.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.042
What?

40:20.709 --> 40:21.585
What now?

40:22.211 --> 40:23.421
Didn't I call for a break?

40:25.548 --> 40:26.382
Du-sik?

40:27.091 --> 40:30.428
What took you so long? I've been waiting.
You'll patrol the area, right?

40:31.178 --> 40:32.638
Yes. How did you know that?

40:33.222 --> 40:36.725
Because I know you. You're not
the type to do just as you're told.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.727
Let's go.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.688
-Are you coming with me?
-Of course.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.275
It's this chief's job

40:44.358 --> 40:48.320
to protect people from danger
and tighten security, I think.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.072
-Really?
-Of course.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.490
Where is it written?

40:52.324 --> 40:54.827
-I guess you didn't read the thing.
-No, I didn't.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.204
-But--
-We're off.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.290
Where is that written? Are you sure?

40:59.373 --> 41:01.250
I don't think I've ever come across it.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.210
I'm going to call the cops.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.963
The dental technician will be arrested.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.048
Ms. Cho too, as a broker.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.634
Come on. I wouldn't call her a broker.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.678
I don't think she had evil intentions.

41:12.761 --> 41:16.599
She is the source of evil to me.
Absolute evil. A villain.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.142
Come on.

41:18.225 --> 41:21.770
The true villain around here
is that man who tried to abduct Ms. Yu.

41:22.354 --> 41:23.230
I know.

41:24.732 --> 41:27.693
It must be true
how small towns are more dangerous.

41:27.776 --> 41:28.944
It's terrifying.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.697
Eun-cheol will be busier now,

41:31.780 --> 41:34.116
so my dating life
will be put on hold some more.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.784
Would that really be

41:36.494 --> 41:38.204
the only reason?

41:42.041 --> 41:46.295
Just so you know, Eun-cheol and I
had a rotisserie chicken moment.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.088
A rotisserie chicken moment?

41:48.172 --> 41:51.842
A dating rookie like you
couldn't possibly understand.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.344
That's harsh.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.929
You're definitely not an expert.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.848
Anyone else would've picked up
on Ji Seong-hyeon's signals.

41:57.932 --> 42:03.020
Being kind is just
a part of Seong-hyeon's nature.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.104
He's nice to everyone.

42:04.188 --> 42:09.401
Look here, my friend.
Guys aren't nice for just any girl.

42:09.485 --> 42:14.031
What guy would deliver brunch
to your doorstep on a Sunday morning?

42:16.992 --> 42:19.078
Fate made you cross paths again,

42:19.161 --> 42:20.454
so think about it.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.289
You and Chief Hong are friends anyway.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.833
Hey. What does this have to do with him?

42:24.917 --> 42:29.296
I'm just asking
because it's all in the past now.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.216
Is Chief Hong a good kisser?

42:32.299 --> 42:35.010
Are you nuts? Unbelievable.

42:35.094 --> 42:38.138
It's just that he's good at everything.
Since he is,

42:38.222 --> 42:40.891
I was wondering about that department too.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.518
-It had me curious.
-No.

42:42.601 --> 42:44.520
I don't remember at all.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.105
My gosh. It sure is hot.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.941
Your cheeks tell me you do remember.

42:49.024 --> 42:50.359
-Let's go home.
-You do.

42:50.442 --> 42:52.236
-You remember it clearly.
-I don't.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.404
Hye-jin!

42:53.988 --> 42:56.615
Seong-hyeon, what brings you by?

42:56.699 --> 42:59.201
I have some free time. Are you off work?

42:59.285 --> 43:00.327
-Well--
-Yes!

43:00.411 --> 43:02.830
Also, I have plans

43:02.913 --> 43:05.457
and should be heading this way.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.543
-What--
-You don't have any plans.

43:07.626 --> 43:11.755
Yes, I do. Have a great time then!

43:11.839 --> 43:13.048
Waitâ€¦

43:14.300 --> 43:16.343
She gets cheeky like that a lot.

43:18.095 --> 43:21.473
Gosh, you're sweating like crazy.
Did you run over here?

43:22.141 --> 43:23.517
Yes, this couldn't wait.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.102
Is something up?

43:25.185 --> 43:26.979
I had something to give you.

43:30.524 --> 43:31.817
Damn it.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.068
What's this?

43:33.736 --> 43:35.154
-My gosh!
-Hold on.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.156
-That's loud.
-Sorry.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.619
Here.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.579
What are all these?

43:43.662 --> 43:45.247
A giftâ€¦

43:46.165 --> 43:48.459
for opening your clinic.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.462
-It's so random, isn't it?
-Wellâ€¦

43:51.545 --> 43:54.381
I heard about what recently happened
in the neighborhood.

43:54.465 --> 43:57.301
I see. You heard it too.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.678
Yes. It had me worried,

43:59.762 --> 44:02.931
so I bought
what I could find at the local store.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.768
Lastly, take this too.

44:07.394 --> 44:08.354
A doll?

44:08.437 --> 44:10.105
Not just any doll. It's a talisman.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.399
I once went to Peru to film something

44:12.483 --> 44:15.152
and learned that the people there believe

44:15.235 --> 44:18.030
that a mummified llama
attached to the roof brings good luck.

44:18.614 --> 44:19.573
A real llama?

44:19.657 --> 44:22.951
Yes. But I couldn't board a plane
with a mummified animal,

44:23.035 --> 44:26.789
so the local guide gave me this
to keep with me at all times.

44:26.872 --> 44:31.293
Then it's a gift that means a lot to you.
You can't give this to me.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.836
It's not permanent.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.422
I'm renting my luck out to you.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.092
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

44:38.175 --> 44:41.303
Your luck sure is adorable.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.184
Come on. I'll walk you home.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.478
Sure. It's this way.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.396
Let's go.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.731
It's an expandable baton.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.150
Gosh, that's loud.

44:56.151 --> 44:57.319
My ears.

45:05.577 --> 45:06.412
It's raining.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.415
It wasn't mentioned in the forecast.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.583
You should go home. I can do this alone.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.544
Forget it. A bit of rain won't kill me.

45:13.627 --> 45:15.587
Should we split up? That'd be faster.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.089
I'll go this way then.

45:17.172 --> 45:18.841
-Be careful.
-You too.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.895
The light still hasn't been fixed.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.314
It's been ages since I sent in a request.

45:35.649 --> 45:36.650
Darn it.

45:40.779 --> 45:44.491
It's gotten dark.
Is Ms. Dentist not home yet?

45:52.040 --> 45:52.958
Hold on.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.261
Good, it's not wet.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.054
Thenâ€¦

46:10.100 --> 46:13.020
Will this stay up here?

46:13.103 --> 46:14.730
Tell me about it.

46:14.813 --> 46:18.817
Seong-hyeon, you should take that home
with you later. I'll lend it to you.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.944
Then we both lent each other something.

46:21.028 --> 46:21.904
Right.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.449
-Chief Hong.
-Ms. Dentist, Director Ji.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.242
Why are you out in the rain?

46:27.326 --> 46:28.827
I'm on patrol.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.954
I'm glad I ran into you.
This is <i>Acanthopanax</i>.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.665
I got too much at home
and didn't want it to rot.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.792
-So I brought it for you.
-Okay.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.712
Why are you out in the rain? Get in here.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.172
Right. We can walk together.

46:40.255 --> 46:43.592
It's fine. It won't kill me.
I only need to patrol up there anyway.

46:43.675 --> 46:46.637
Wait. Let me go inside
and get you an umbrella.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.014
No, it's fine. Good night!

46:50.015 --> 46:51.016
Butâ€¦

47:41.692 --> 47:42.526
How adorable.

47:50.617 --> 47:53.495
I offered an umbrella,
so why didn't he take it?

48:02.504 --> 48:04.256
So is this <i>Acanthopanax</i>?

48:07.217 --> 48:08.427
<i>Acanthopanax</i>.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.765
ACANTHOPANAX

48:13.849 --> 48:15.559
"Good for herniated discs."

48:19.688 --> 48:22.608
But he was going to throw them away?
Lucky me.

48:24.776 --> 48:27.404
How does one eat this though?

48:30.657 --> 48:31.658
Should I brew it?

48:46.381 --> 48:47.382
Gosh, it's bitter.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.427
How is anyone supposed to enjoy this?

49:07.402 --> 49:09.446
I should at least say thank you.

49:15.535 --> 49:17.120
MS. DENTIST

49:30.467 --> 49:33.804
<i>The call cannot be picked up right nowâ€¦</i>

49:35.806 --> 49:36.973
He's not answering.

49:48.568 --> 49:49.611
Hello.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.658
Chief Hong, shouldn't we
get the tarp ready

49:54.741 --> 49:56.827
in case it rains like yesterday?

49:56.910 --> 49:58.912
We can have it cover this area.

49:58.995 --> 50:03.458
Right. That way, it can block the sun too.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.545
Chief Hong, you look terrible.

50:06.628 --> 50:09.464
Exactly. I told him to rest,
but he won't listen.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.758
I'm perfectly fine.

50:11.842 --> 50:12.884
You're coughing.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.638
-Is it because of the rain?
-What do you take me for?

50:16.722 --> 50:18.515
Getting soaked in rain won't kill you.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.560
Do I need to get you a tarp then?

50:21.643 --> 50:24.730
Yes, that's right.
But take it easy, will you?

50:24.813 --> 50:26.606
It's fine. I'll get one for you.

50:26.690 --> 50:27.816
Gosh.

50:32.779 --> 50:33.780
Hello?

50:33.864 --> 50:35.615
<i>Hi, I'm calling from Duri Bank.</i>

50:35.699 --> 50:38.952
-Ms. Kim, it must be you.
-<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

50:39.035 --> 50:43.248
<i>Well, I'm calling you about
a new high-interest savings plan.</i>

50:43.331 --> 50:46.001
Finally. My goodness!

50:46.084 --> 50:49.337
Hold on a second.
Doesn't the bank close on Sundays?

50:49.421 --> 50:52.257
<i>It does,
but only a handful of people can get it.</i>

50:52.340 --> 50:54.926
<i>It'll be too late
if you wait until Monday.</i>

50:55.010 --> 50:57.345
<i>I'm calling in secretly
to get you in before the slots fill up.</i>

50:57.429 --> 50:59.723
Goodness, I'm so grateful!

51:28.710 --> 51:33.507
Excuse me.
Were you perhaps sent by Ms. Kim?

51:33.590 --> 51:34.841
That's right.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.929
Hello. So this would
get me into that savings plan

51:39.012 --> 51:41.223
with an interest rate
of 15 percent, right?

51:41.306 --> 51:42.307
Of course.

51:42.390 --> 51:45.185
Please don't lose it then.
I need it for something important.

51:45.268 --> 51:47.521
All right. Thenâ€¦

51:47.604 --> 51:48.855
Hold on a second.

51:50.398 --> 51:52.984
Dr. Yoon, what are you doing here?

51:53.652 --> 51:54.945
Do you have money in there?

51:55.612 --> 51:57.614
Is this someone you know?

51:59.991 --> 52:01.827
Why are you giving him cash out here?

52:02.369 --> 52:04.162
Well, that'sâ€¦

52:04.663 --> 52:08.166
I don't need to explain this to you.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.795
-This is a phishing scam, isn't it?
-Sorry?

52:12.295 --> 52:13.255
What did he say?

52:13.964 --> 52:15.757
The prosecution? A loan?

52:15.841 --> 52:19.261
That's not the case.
I'm not a fool, you know.

52:19.344 --> 52:22.389
You're making a big mistake.
He was sent by a bank employee.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.975
I also talked to
my financial consultant this morning.

52:25.058 --> 52:26.393
What's the consultant's name?

52:26.476 --> 52:27.811
Ms. Kim Mi-yeong.

52:29.271 --> 52:30.564
Shit!

52:31.481 --> 52:32.858
Damn it.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.067
What?

52:34.150 --> 52:35.360
Damn it.

52:36.194 --> 52:37.612
-No!
-Darn it.

52:37.696 --> 52:39.531
Hey, you're sweating.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.450
-Can't you please go rest?
-Stop.

52:42.534 --> 52:47.289
I value one's welfare, you know.
You're making me the evil employer.

52:47.372 --> 52:52.043
It's fine. I called Geum-cheol,
and his store has the right kind of tarp.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.754
-The hardware store?
-Yes.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.424
I wonder if the POS works better now.

52:58.758 --> 53:00.719
Why are you all up in people's business?

53:00.802 --> 53:02.929
-That's my job, you know.
-I was only--

53:03.013 --> 53:04.014
What was that?

53:04.598 --> 53:06.182
-Get him!
-Ms. Dentist?

53:06.266 --> 53:07.100
Was that Hye-jin?

53:11.855 --> 53:13.940
Damn it.

53:15.775 --> 53:17.819
-Damn it.
-Stop!

53:17.903 --> 53:19.362
If only I hadn't jogged today.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.742
Damn it.

53:27.871 --> 53:29.956
God damn it.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.124
Don't follow me.

53:35.045 --> 53:38.173
Damn it. God, that bastard.

53:38.256 --> 53:39.799
-Hey!
-Damn it!

53:40.508 --> 53:42.302
Stop following me, you prick.

53:43.637 --> 53:44.971
Chief Hong, where did you go?

53:45.472 --> 53:46.640
Chief Hong!

53:46.723 --> 53:47.974
Damn it.

53:56.608 --> 53:57.734
Damn it.

53:59.486 --> 54:00.320
Hey.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.659
-Let go!
-Would you if you were me?

54:05.742 --> 54:08.370
Anyway, what have you done?

54:08.453 --> 54:10.288
Theft? Fraud?

54:10.372 --> 54:12.624
You came after me not knowing why?

54:12.707 --> 54:14.542
Because Ms. Dentist told me to.

54:14.626 --> 54:16.127
Gosh, that was exhausting.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.963
-You caught him.
-Took you long enough.

54:18.046 --> 54:21.758
Director Ji, can you pick up the money?
As you can see, my hands are full.

54:21.841 --> 54:22.926
Right.

54:23.009 --> 54:25.011
-Just lie still.
-You littleâ€¦

54:28.431 --> 54:29.516
Yes, that over there.

54:31.226 --> 54:33.269
-That hurts.
-Give me your arm.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.105
-Your arm.
-Fine, take it.

54:35.188 --> 54:36.856
-Your arm.
-Here you go.

54:36.940 --> 54:41.403
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

54:43.780 --> 54:47.200
I can't afford to lose that money.
Hwa-jeong, my A-ramâ€¦

54:49.911 --> 54:51.329
Are you hurt anywhere?

54:51.413 --> 54:54.124
I can't afford to lose that money!

54:55.917 --> 54:57.002
Du-sik?

54:57.585 --> 54:58.586
Arrest him.

55:00.171 --> 55:02.549
-Ma'amâ€¦
-My money!

55:03.383 --> 55:06.636
I need that money!

55:06.720 --> 55:10.515
Please calm down. Your money's right here.

55:10.598 --> 55:13.435
What? Director Ji!

55:14.144 --> 55:17.564
Director Ji, thank you so much.

55:17.647 --> 55:20.900
Actually, it was Chief Hong
who caught the guy.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.903
Du-sik, thank you.

55:23.987 --> 55:25.238
Keep it safe.

55:25.321 --> 55:26.823
I will. Thank you.

55:26.906 --> 55:28.491
Come with us to the station.

55:28.575 --> 55:30.660
Ms. Cho, you sure are gullible.

55:30.744 --> 55:33.830
You should've been more careful.
How could you have fallen for that?

55:33.913 --> 55:37.000
Why are you yelling at the victim
when he's the one at fault?

55:37.500 --> 55:39.127
I didn't mean it like that.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.755
That damn scumbag is the problem. Hey!

55:41.838 --> 55:42.922
This way, ma'am.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.341
Can I ride with you?

55:45.425 --> 55:47.552
But you'd have to sit with the culprit.

55:47.635 --> 55:50.847
If that's the case,
you should be more worried about him.

55:51.890 --> 55:54.142
-Be careful, guys.
-Thank you.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.771
You rat bastard!

55:57.854 --> 55:59.647
-I'll keep you updated.
-Sure thing.

56:08.656 --> 56:10.200
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

56:10.283 --> 56:11.910
No, I didn't do much.

56:14.162 --> 56:15.371
Thanks, Chief Hong.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.332
I only did what I had to.

56:19.793 --> 56:21.252
-What?
-Did you get hurt?

56:22.087 --> 56:23.463
It's nothing.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.716
You don't look so good either.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.553
I'm sorry, but I need to call it a day.
Geum-cheol knows what you need.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.847
Good thinking.
Don't worry and get some rest.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.015
See you.

56:40.271 --> 56:41.272
Hye-jin,

56:41.773 --> 56:44.109
you even chase phishing scammers now?

56:44.192 --> 56:48.780
No. It was all thanks to you
and Chief Hong that he was caught.

56:49.364 --> 56:50.365
It was cool of you.

57:19.394 --> 57:20.395
Ms. Dentist?

57:22.564 --> 57:23.440
What's up?

57:24.065 --> 57:25.358
I'm here on a house call.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.318
I'm good, so go back.

57:35.118 --> 57:37.704
You sure talk a lot
for someone at 38.9Â°C. Move.

57:37.787 --> 57:38.788
Butâ€¦

57:56.222 --> 57:57.098
Come sit.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.142
Just leave the medicine and go.

57:59.225 --> 58:00.602
Listen to your doctor.

58:03.271 --> 58:07.192
Doctor? Didn't you say
you were only a dentist?

58:10.445 --> 58:11.905
Let's see that arm first.

58:13.406 --> 58:16.951
Is it that red ointment?
That stings a lot.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.078
Nothing is a better antiseptic.

58:19.579 --> 58:20.413
Give me your arm.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.251
This will sting a little.

58:29.464 --> 58:30.632
Gosh, that stings.

58:50.652 --> 58:53.029
Your face is even redder than before.

58:54.405 --> 58:57.617
That's because I'm running a fever.

58:58.493 --> 59:01.120
They say not even dogs
catch colds in the summer.

59:02.580 --> 59:03.873
Have you eaten anything?

59:05.083 --> 59:06.167
No.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.752
Is there anything you're craving?

59:07.835 --> 59:11.005
It's fine. You treated me,
so I'd rather rest now. Go on.

59:11.089 --> 59:13.424
You're not well. Just tell me.

59:14.008 --> 59:16.135
Who knows?
Maybe it''ll appear from thin air.

59:16.219 --> 59:17.512
As if.

59:18.221 --> 59:20.348
What could I want? Tangerines?

59:20.848 --> 59:23.643
-Tangerines?
-I don't have an appetite,

59:23.726 --> 59:25.395
so something tangy came to mind.

59:25.478 --> 59:28.106
Acidic food is bad for an empty stomach.

59:28.189 --> 59:29.691
You should have porridge instead.

59:30.692 --> 59:31.693
Hold on.

59:33.486 --> 59:35.196
Everything gets delivered these days.

59:38.032 --> 59:40.827
There's no porridge place
in this small town.

59:42.036 --> 59:42.954
How about <i>jokbal</i>?

59:44.539 --> 59:45.456
Seriouslyâ€¦

59:45.540 --> 59:47.917
Raw fish isn't bad
with a drizzle of citrusy lemon.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.419
Just go home, will you?

59:52.880 --> 59:53.798
Do you have rice?

59:54.841 --> 59:56.050
What for?

59:56.134 --> 59:57.927
It's sad when you're sick alone.

59:58.803 --> 1:00:01.347
Everyone knows that. Why don't you?

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:06.311
-What now?
-Lie down.

1:00:11.024 --> 1:00:14.527
Even if you hear plates breaking
or some screaming,

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:17.697
keep away from the kitchen, okay?

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:20.283
Just don't burn my house down.

1:00:20.366 --> 1:00:21.701
Got it.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:32.170
Wait. Something just shattered.

1:00:32.837 --> 1:00:34.380
Did you break something?

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:35.590
No, I didn't.

1:00:37.550 --> 1:00:40.136
I'm too sick to see what happened.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:44.223
My kitchenâ€¦

1:00:45.391 --> 1:00:47.143
She's tearing it down.

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:51.606
Nothing will be left.

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:03.326
He really fell asleep.

1:01:04.952 --> 1:01:06.704
It's not like him to listen to me.

1:01:34.565 --> 1:01:36.150
<i>Is Chief Hong a good kisser?</i>

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:23.406
I must be going nuts. What's with me?

1:02:27.368 --> 1:02:31.247
I'm out of it. Hye-jin, you're going nuts.

1:02:31.330 --> 1:02:32.832
You're completely losing it.

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:37.044
-You--
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:39.922
-Sorry?
-You slapped yourself just now.

1:02:40.715 --> 1:02:42.383
Your cheeks are red.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:44.594
Wellâ€¦

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:47.764
-I did something that deserves it.
-What?

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:50.892
TANGERINES

1:03:08.701 --> 1:03:11.120
<i>Eat it all, down to the last drop.</i>

1:03:42.693 --> 1:03:43.820
Seriously?

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:47.240
How can porridge taste like this?

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:52.537
It couldn't possibly taste any worse.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:55.873
What's there to ruin
when it's just rice and water?

1:03:57.124 --> 1:03:58.751
Why is it sour?

1:04:03.130 --> 1:04:04.799
And she wants me to finish it?

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:06.676
Where's her conscience?

1:04:12.306 --> 1:04:13.850
Okay, let's eat.

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:17.353
Seriously?

1:04:27.321 --> 1:04:28.990
I can't possibly have more.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.711
Ms. Dentist, youâ€¦

1:04:43.963 --> 1:04:45.840
Gosh, my head.

1:05:38.059 --> 1:05:38.893
What?

1:05:41.771 --> 1:05:43.773
When did she leave it here?

1:05:49.028 --> 1:05:51.072
It sure is nice.

1:06:04.168 --> 1:06:05.169
It's tasty.

1:06:22.395 --> 1:06:24.438
-Dr. Yoon.
-Hi, Ms. Yeo.

1:06:24.522 --> 1:06:25.648
Are you here for coffee?

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:27.191
That's right.

1:06:27.274 --> 1:06:30.361
How about I treat you to some coffee
at my restaurant today?

1:06:30.444 --> 1:06:31.904
It'll only take ten minutes.

1:06:33.322 --> 1:06:34.240
Sure.

1:06:37.284 --> 1:06:39.286
-Doctor.
-Goodness.

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:40.788
-It's black coffee.
-Yes.

1:06:40.871 --> 1:06:42.832
They have all sorts of instant coffee.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:44.834
I see. Thank you.

1:06:47.169 --> 1:06:49.588
Thank you for helping Nam-suk.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:52.717
I didn't do it because it was Ms. Cho.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:54.260
He just seemed suspicious.

1:06:54.343 --> 1:06:57.263
Did Nam-suk call to thank you?

1:06:57.346 --> 1:07:00.141
Of course not. I don't expect her to.

1:07:00.224 --> 1:07:03.728
Gosh. She gets
on your nerves, doesn't she?

1:07:04.311 --> 1:07:05.896
She spews a lot of nonsense.

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:08.691
She's the type to ask for trouble.

1:07:09.442 --> 1:07:12.903
I know that.
Everyone in this neighborhood does.

1:07:12.987 --> 1:07:15.156
But you all still let it slide.

1:07:16.449 --> 1:07:19.326
To be honest, she takes it a bit too far.

1:07:19.410 --> 1:07:22.246
The rumors were annoying enough,

1:07:23.289 --> 1:07:25.624
but she really crossed the line
about my work.

1:07:25.708 --> 1:07:27.835
How could she get illegal tooth inlays

1:07:27.918 --> 1:07:30.129
and even persuade others too?

1:07:30.963 --> 1:07:33.382
She only thought it'd help.

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:35.843
What is she saving
all that money for anyway?

1:07:37.344 --> 1:07:40.848
Nam-suk used to have a daughter.

1:07:41.474 --> 1:07:42.725
Her name was A-ram.

1:07:44.018 --> 1:07:45.978
She was the same age as Ju-ri.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:48.064
Why don't we wash up a little?

1:07:56.781 --> 1:07:59.366
Look how clean your hands are now!

1:07:59.450 --> 1:08:02.203
How can my daughter
have such pretty hands?

1:08:02.286 --> 1:08:04.246
-Who do you get all this beauty from?
-You.

1:08:04.330 --> 1:08:07.291
Yes, you take after me. Give me five!

1:08:07.374 --> 1:08:08.667
Nice!

1:08:09.293 --> 1:08:11.796
My girl even has the prettiest fingers.

1:08:13.172 --> 1:08:17.051
What kind of magic
will you show me this time around?

1:08:17.134 --> 1:08:20.304
I'm going to cast a spell
that makes my illness go away

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.307
and lets me live with you for centuries.

1:08:25.267 --> 1:08:27.436
I want to cast that spell too.

1:08:27.978 --> 1:08:29.939
-Why don't we try it together?
-Sure.

1:08:30.022 --> 1:08:31.899
One, two, three.

1:08:31.982 --> 1:08:36.070
-Abracadabra, A-ram power!
-Abracadabra, A-ram power!

1:08:37.613 --> 1:08:39.990
-A-ram power!
-A-ram power!

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:42.701
Goodness me.

1:08:45.663 --> 1:08:47.373
-Why don't we go to sleep?
-Sure.

1:08:47.456 --> 1:08:49.500
Come here, my princess.

1:08:49.583 --> 1:08:51.460
I love you, Mom.

1:08:52.294 --> 1:08:55.631
My baby, I love you more.

A-ram power.

1:09:39.049 --> 1:09:42.344
A-ram powerâ€¦

1:10:42.863 --> 1:10:45.908
<i>making donations in A-ram's name
to the children's hospital.</i>

1:10:47.451 --> 1:10:51.080
-<i>She's been doing it yearly ever since.</i>
-You know it tastes amazing!

1:10:51.664 --> 1:10:54.124
<i>It may be because
we've seen her wither away,</i>

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:56.543
-<i>but her being a pain in the butt</i>
-Ju-ri!

1:10:56.627 --> 1:10:58.504
<i>is better than the alternative.</i>

1:10:59.171 --> 1:11:01.298
<i>We know it's only because she's lonely.</i>

1:11:01.382 --> 1:11:03.259
I got you what you love.

1:11:03.342 --> 1:11:04.385
There you go!

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:07.179
<i>So despite all the trouble she causes,</i>

1:11:08.013 --> 1:11:10.724
<i>I'd rather see her be all right.</i>

1:11:31.203 --> 1:11:33.455
-Can you open your mouth?
-What?

1:11:33.956 --> 1:11:36.375
Open your mouth so I can check your inlay.

1:11:37.334 --> 1:11:39.962
How can I do that on the street?

1:11:40.045 --> 1:11:41.505
Then come to the clinic.

1:11:43.841 --> 1:11:46.844
I must check if that quack technician
put it in correctly.

1:11:48.053 --> 1:11:48.971
Got it.

1:11:49.471 --> 1:11:53.434
Do it again,
and I'll report you both to the police.

1:11:54.685 --> 1:11:55.519
Sure.

1:11:55.602 --> 1:11:56.979
Come by today.

1:11:58.772 --> 1:12:03.569
Also, we'd like some free dumplings
now and again when we order <i>tangsuyuk</i>.

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:07.323
And stop taking so much
of the free coffee we offer.

1:12:07.823 --> 1:12:08.824
I'll see you.

1:12:10.367 --> 1:12:11.410
Thank you.

1:12:11.910 --> 1:12:12.745
Sorry?

1:12:14.204 --> 1:12:15.456
Thank you!

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:18.167
Sure.

1:12:18.959 --> 1:12:20.252
Please come by today.

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:21.545
All right.

1:12:21.628 --> 1:12:25.632
Dr. Yoon, you look
exceptionally pretty today.

1:12:25.716 --> 1:12:27.551
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1:12:32.139 --> 1:12:33.098
Wait for me.

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.935
-Check out the seagulls.
-There are loads.

1:12:37.019 --> 1:12:38.771
I haven't been to the sea in a while.

1:12:41.523 --> 1:12:43.192
-This must be the place.
-It is.

1:12:50.991 --> 1:12:51.825
Check those out.

1:12:53.243 --> 1:12:54.620
What a cozy town.

1:12:57.247 --> 1:12:59.541
Seong-hyeon, what do we do now?

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:01.377
Just be at ease and look stylish.

1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:02.920
-Look stylish?
-Stylish.

1:13:03.712 --> 1:13:04.713
What do you think?

1:13:04.797 --> 1:13:08.258
Can you refrain from sweeping
your hair back? Do something else.

1:13:08.342 --> 1:13:09.385
Don't discourage him.

1:13:09.468 --> 1:13:11.011
What's so weird about that?

1:13:11.095 --> 1:13:12.763
As if there's anything to see.

1:13:12.846 --> 1:13:14.139
-Seriously?
-Go alone then.

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:16.225
Come on. Don't be like that.

1:13:16.308 --> 1:13:17.559
They must be here already.

1:13:17.643 --> 1:13:20.145
-Hurry!
-Gosh, all these peopleâ€¦

1:13:20.229 --> 1:13:21.355
They must be filming.

1:13:21.438 --> 1:13:24.149
Can you guys let Ju-ri see?

1:13:24.233 --> 1:13:26.819
Ju-ri, there's JUNE that you love
over there.

1:13:26.902 --> 1:13:28.112
Dad, I can't see.

1:13:28.195 --> 1:13:31.073
Hold on a second. Step on that.

1:13:31.156 --> 1:13:32.449
-There.
-All right.

1:13:32.533 --> 1:13:34.701
-It's JUNE, your favorite!
-Quiet, please.

1:13:34.785 --> 1:13:36.703
Right. Sorry about that.

1:13:36.787 --> 1:13:38.080
Careful now.

1:13:50.134 --> 1:13:52.386
-Is this working?
-I don't know.

1:13:57.224 --> 1:13:58.809
Chief Hong!

1:13:58.892 --> 1:14:00.936
What are they filming? Can I come in?

1:14:01.019 --> 1:14:01.937
Sure.

1:14:55.532 --> 1:14:57.075
The light has gone out.

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:00.537
Why won't my phone's flashlight turn on?

1:15:00.621 --> 1:15:02.414
Darn it. My phone died.

1:15:03.123 --> 1:15:04.541
I should've charged it.

1:15:44.706 --> 1:15:45.707
Ms. Dentist?

1:15:49.670 --> 1:15:51.338
Your clinic closed hours ago.

1:15:52.172 --> 1:15:53.757
You shouldn't be out so late--

1:17:17.466 --> 1:17:19.676
I must be going nuts. What's with me?

1:18:15.857 --> 1:18:17.776
<i>So you're Chief Hong?</i>

1:18:17.859 --> 1:18:20.946
I'm Ms. Dentist--
I mean, Hye-jin's boyfriend.

1:18:22.155 --> 1:18:26.326
<i>Hello! I'm Ji Seong-hyeon,
Hye-jin's senior from college.</i>

1:18:26.410 --> 1:18:28.620
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1:18:29.663 --> 1:18:32.082
<i>How long have you two met?</i>

1:18:32.165 --> 1:18:33.542
<i>What is the matter?</i>

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:35.961
<i>It's nothing personal against him,</i>

1:18:36.044 --> 1:18:37.838
<i>but you shouldn't be seeing him.</i>

1:18:37.921 --> 1:18:40.674
-Dad.
-Break up before it gets any deeper.

1:18:40.757 --> 1:18:43.844
<i>Hye-jin, when I go back down to Gongjin,</i>

1:18:43.927 --> 1:18:45.053
can you meet up with me?

1:18:45.137 --> 1:18:48.098
<i>Do you like her a lot?</i>

1:18:50.517 --> 1:18:51.351
Yes.

1:18:51.852 --> 1:18:56.857
