WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:05.838
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:06.047 --> 00:09.508
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.012
Oh, my God, you should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

00:16.015 --> 00:17.474
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.351
How much did you tip the super?

00:19.519 --> 00:22.896
Yeah, we were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.232
Oh, this year
we just made him cookies.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.609
And 25 it is.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.654
Heh. You gave him cookies?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.740
- Money is so impersonal.
- Yeah.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.700
Cookies says someone really cares.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.746
All right, we're broke,
but cookies do say that.

00:39.914 --> 00:40.998
I can see that.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.292
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.049
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these, uh, "funny" brownies?

00:50.258 --> 00:52.509
Not especially.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.179
But, you know,
I think they had pot in them.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.768
So, you guys, who else did you tip
with cookies?

01:00.935 --> 01:03.187
Uh, the mailman, the super...

01:04.563 --> 01:07.191
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.526
Oh, my God.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.111
What?

01:11.279 --> 01:13.072
Uh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.323
Oh, wow.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.366
Oh, gosh.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.828
Oh, these are cookies
smashed in the Sports section.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.955
And he did my crossword puzzle.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.918
Yeah, but not very well,
unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

01:26.086 --> 01:30.255
...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me."

02:20.473 --> 02:23.183
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
You know?

02:23.351 --> 02:26.145
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

02:26.312 --> 02:29.314
...your lords are a-leaping
and your geese are a-laying. Heh.

02:30.775 --> 02:34.945
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.615
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.993
Hey, Rach.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.079
I, uh, got you a little present.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.958
I'll open it.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.419
It's a Slinky!

02:50.587 --> 02:52.713
Ha, ha. Remember, huh?

02:52.881 --> 02:55.090
Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

02:55.258 --> 02:57.134
Everyone knows it's...

02:58.887 --> 03:01.138
Just a big spring.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.932
You're still mad because of the whole...

03:04.184 --> 03:06.518
Horrible list of reasons not to be with me?

03:06.728 --> 03:09.354
How about we just call it
"the unfortunate incident"?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.736
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.197
- Yeah.
- Go nuts.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.700
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.119
What's in the bag?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.496
Mm, just some presents.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.707
Come on, show us what you bought.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.834
You know you want to.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.712
Okay.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.509
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.261
Oh, that's cute.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.473
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.979
And, uh, I got this blouse for Mom.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.232
- Ross, that is gorgeous!
- Yeah?

03:53.399 --> 03:56.068
Look at these authentic fake medals!

03:56.236 --> 03:58.070
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

03:58.238 --> 04:00.364
...at the make-believe military academy!

04:02.158 --> 04:04.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.955
- Happy Christmas Eve Eve.
- You too.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.207
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.085
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.586
This is my father!

04:14.754 --> 04:16.421
This is a picture of my dad!

04:19.841 --> 04:22.552
Uh, Pheebs, that's the guy
that comes in the frame.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.972
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.391
I thought your dad was in prison.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.184
No, that's my stepdad.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.729
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.898
How have you never been on Oprah?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.819
Look, see? This is him.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.656
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

04:45.743 --> 04:48.370
Honey, uh, this is a picture
of the frame guy...

04:48.538 --> 04:51.248
...posing in front of a blue screen
with a collie.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.668
It's not a blue screen. It's just...

04:54.919 --> 04:57.671
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.093
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.305
- Wait a minute, honey!
- Pheebs.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.016
- Whoa.
- Wow.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.061
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.272
Joey.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.692
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.947
Esther Livingston.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.992
Gone!

05:28.244 --> 05:30.704
Um... Hi, Pooh.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.165
Hi, Gram. Ahem, what you doing?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.876
Oh, just updating the phone book.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.338
Um, Gram? Um...

05:39.505 --> 05:41.757
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

05:41.966 --> 05:43.759
Oh.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.010
Oh, sure, sure.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.637
Uh... Huh, how come?

05:47.805 --> 05:50.474
Just, you know, to see him.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.642
Oh, sure. Here.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.061
All right, uh...

05:54.228 --> 05:57.230
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.818
And, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.447
And here he is at a graduation.

06:06.741 --> 06:13.705
Another graduation.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.750
Is this really my father?

06:17.293 --> 06:18.919
Is it really your...?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.547
Well, of course it is.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.718
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

06:27.804 --> 06:28.845
Well, I...

06:29.013 --> 06:31.890
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

06:32.058 --> 06:33.600
...you've never lied.

06:35.019 --> 06:39.272
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.651
Oh, God.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.654
It was your mother's idea.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.240
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

06:48.408 --> 06:50.367
...because it hurt her so much when he left.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.577
I didn't wanna go along with it.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.123
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.086
Not impossible, but harder.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.881
All right.
So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

07:09.303 --> 07:13.640
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma
where there's no phones?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.519
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.312
That makes no sense.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.649
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.278
Honey.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.613
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.826
Anyway, that's all I know.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.455
That...

07:38.166 --> 07:39.958
...and this.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.045
This...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.923
...is the real him.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.218
Oh.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.056
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

07:55.308 --> 07:58.393
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

07:58.644 --> 08:01.646
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

08:01.856 --> 08:06.526
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.863
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.240
Who said anything about Christmas?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.871
- Hi.
- Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.414
No, nothing.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.999
I hope she's okay.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.168
I know exactly what she's going through.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.712
How do you know
what she's going through?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.464
She told us.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.594
What do you got there, Monica?

08:32.845 --> 08:34.054
Stuff for the party.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.140
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.975
You didn't buy presents yet?

08:39.184 --> 08:41.852
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

08:42.020 --> 08:45.023
Don't you have to be Claymation
to say stuff like that?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.861
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think
the mailman liked your cookies.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.905
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.243
Well...

08:56.452 --> 09:00.580
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.792
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.093
Hey, Rach. Ahem.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.221
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.224
How about you make a list about me?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.601
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here...

09:21.811 --> 09:22.978
...and make a list.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.146
Okay, you're whiny...

09:25.356 --> 09:28.275
...you are obsessive, you are insecure...

09:28.442 --> 09:30.193
...you're gutless.
- Heh.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.445
You don't ever just seize the day.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.657
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.077
And, uh... Oh, you wear
too much of that gel in your hair.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.417
See, there. You, uh...

09:45.585 --> 09:47.168
All right, you did what I said.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.629
- And you know what?
- Hmm?

09:49.797 --> 09:51.590
You're right. I do feel better.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.841
Thank you, Ross.

09:58.889 --> 10:03.435
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

10:04.562 --> 10:07.564
Okay. Um, in lthaca?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.900
All right, um, Saratoga?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.403
Oneonta?

10:13.821 --> 10:17.365
You know what?
You shouldn't call yourself Information!

10:22.413 --> 10:23.496
Hey.

10:23.664 --> 10:27.542
Hello, Grandma.
If that is, in fact, your real name.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.921
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.383
- How's it going?
- Oh, not so good.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.929
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.600
Well, I think you're better off without him.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.561
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.939
But to me,
he's still the irresponsible creep...

10:50.149 --> 10:54.194
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.366
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

11:00.242 --> 11:02.452
Yeah, I know.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.205
Okay.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.709
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I told you that, uh, I didn't know...

11:09.919 --> 11:12.170
...exactly where he lived.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.130
What do you mean?

11:14.340 --> 11:18.385
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.264
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.308
You can take my cab.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.851
Wow.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.311
Thank you.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.316
- Nobody else drives that cab.
- Uh-huh. Got it.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.734
Oh.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.237
- I'm gonna see my dad!
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.240
- Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.866
Mm, okay. Oh.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.369
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.837
Hey.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.422
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

11:55.589 --> 11:58.258
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.759
Hop in!

12:00.553 --> 12:03.179
She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.224
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...

12:06.392 --> 12:08.518
...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.353
We'll still have plenty of time.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.732
- Hey, here she comes!
- Hey.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.067
Hey, hey.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.069
Hi.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.698
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.450
Can you believe this?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.952
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.247
Yeah, big stuff.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.874
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.042
- Here, you have to hold this.
- Okay.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.506
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

12:39.383 --> 12:40.717
Uh-huh, that's my cheat sheet.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.307
- Where's my seat belt?
- That side doesn't have one.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.185
The paramedics had to cut through it.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.782
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.

13:05.159 --> 13:09.204
For the 16th time,
no, I do not think you're obsessive.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.583
- Oh, it's hot in here!
- Rach, get the heat.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.503
- Ross, turn the heat down, please?
- Sure.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.838
There's a difference between obsessive...

13:19.006 --> 13:20.173
Ross, the heat!

13:20.341 --> 13:24.469
Okay. Heat, heat, heat.
And I'm the obsessive one?

13:25.346 --> 13:26.429
Okay.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.348
This way is on.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.476
So this is...

13:33.479 --> 13:35.104
...off.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.358
Did you just break the radiator?

13:38.567 --> 13:41.486
No, I was turning the knob and...

13:41.737 --> 13:43.446
...here it is.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.864
Well, put it back!

13:47.743 --> 13:48.952
It, uh...

13:49.119 --> 13:52.163
- It won't go back.
- Ugh. I'll call the super.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.790
Here, let me try.

13:53.958 --> 13:58.169
Oh, oh, that's right.
I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.129
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

14:00.297 --> 14:01.422
...Not Funny!

14:01.632 --> 14:03.258
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.385
It's Rachel Green from upstairs.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.638
Yes, somebody, uh,
broke our knob on the radiator...

14:08.848 --> 14:11.683
...and it's really hot in here.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.853
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.983
Well, do you think
we could have a new one by 6?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.986
What? No, no. Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.946
We're having a party tonight.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.447
Okay, tip the man.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.533
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.493
I won't be blackmailed.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.954
Look, if it gets a little warm...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.831
...it can be a theme party.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.834
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

14:41.088 --> 14:42.338
Ooh, this is it.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.257
Seventy-four.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.261
Oh, so that's what this is for!

14:48.429 --> 14:49.554
Wow.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.682
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.018
This is, like, the biggest thing ever, huh?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.270
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.147
Here I go. I'm going in.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.398
All right!

15:00.566 --> 15:01.858
Good luck, Pheebs.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.610
Okay.

15:03.819 --> 15:09.157
Here I go.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.243
I'm going.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.381
Hi.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.967
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party, heh.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.721
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.601
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...

15:36.810 --> 15:39.854
...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.

15:42.358 --> 15:46.778
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.115
Ice?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.911
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.162
All right.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.247
Monica. Monica!

15:59.208 --> 16:02.418
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.754
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.007
Ha, ha. Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.972
Mr. Treeger.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.556
You said there was a party.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.058
Oh, yeah.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.810
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.855
Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.483
Probably because I have so much skin.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.194
Hey, cheese!

16:29.905 --> 16:32.615
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.952
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.704
No, I will not cave.

16:37.871 --> 16:38.955
I'm with Mon.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.417
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

16:42.668 --> 16:46.004
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

16:47.881 --> 16:48.923
Mr. Treeger?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.969
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.387
Oh, wow.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.638
I didn't get you anything.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.017
Here's five back.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.562
No, that's your Christmas tip.

17:02.730 --> 17:07.275
Oh, do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

17:07.483 --> 17:09.736
No can do. Like I told the girl...

17:09.903 --> 17:11.738
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.156
- Ross?
- Yeah?

17:14.324 --> 17:16.075
He's playing baseball.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.077
You mean hardball?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.498
Whatever.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.333
What you gonna do?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.669
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.880
Mr. Treeger?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.215
Here's another 50.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.051
Happy Hanukkah.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.345
Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?

17:36.555 --> 17:37.764
No.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.892
The place is not open till Tuesday.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.435
Am I not saying it right?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.106
So you really did like my cookies?

17:47.316 --> 17:51.110
Oh, yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.326
Nice seizing...

17:58.535 --> 18:00.411
...gel boy.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.624
So, uh...

18:04.833 --> 18:06.751
Is this, uh, mistletoe?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.421
No, uh, that...

18:10.672 --> 18:12.882
That is basil.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.052
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.222
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.184
No, it's still basil.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.074
Okay.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.868
- How far did you get?
- Mailbox.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.080
- All right, we're getting closer.
- Uh-huh.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.666
What's going on?

18:47.543 --> 18:50.294
It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.

18:50.462 --> 18:55.049
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.719
And, you know, now he's, uh,
a pharmacist guy and...

18:58.929 --> 19:03.057
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

19:03.267 --> 19:07.645
Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...

19:07.813 --> 19:11.065
...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.902
I'll go to his pharmacy
and everyone will be nice to me...

19:15.070 --> 19:18.072
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.615
So why not go knock?

19:23.412 --> 19:28.499
Because, I mean,
what if he's not this great dad guy?

19:29.042 --> 19:33.754
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

19:35.924 --> 19:37.508
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.052
You know what?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.681
I've already lost a fake dad this week.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.768
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.566
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.319
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:56.486 --> 20:00.031
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.075
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.828
You guys.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.334
Sorry about your shopping.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.962
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.383
I know you're not going in there...

20:19.593 --> 20:23.095
...but do you think it'd be all right
if I went in and used his bathroom?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.515
That's fine, never mind.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.227
Cool, snow!

20:29.436 --> 20:31.938
Kind of like a blank canvas.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.533
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

20:46.870 --> 20:49.038
You mind if I turn the heat down?

20:49.206 --> 20:52.625
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.669
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

20:54.836 --> 20:56.921
Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.257
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

20:59.466 --> 21:02.260
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.345
So that's enough for now.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.723
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

21:07.933 --> 21:11.560
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.313
The knob was broken...

21:14.481 --> 21:18.150
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.498
Rach, these are for you.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.543
Wiper blades.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.503
I don't even have a car.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.799
Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.305
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.518
Toilet-seat covers.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.690
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.025
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.193
You guys!

22:01.361 --> 22:02.611
And for Ross...

22:02.779 --> 22:05.197
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.244
You got me a cola drink?

22:10.454 --> 22:13.205
And a lemon-lime!

22:15.459 --> 22:20.129
Well, this is too much. I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.884
And last but not least...

22:26.928 --> 22:29.597
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
