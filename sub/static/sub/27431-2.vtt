WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:05.673
- Previously on Gotham...
- Gotham falls, we rise.

00:09.844 --> 00:10.970
<i>GORDON:
After the bridges blew,</i>

00:11.137 --> 00:12.722
<i>the city was up for grabs.</i>

00:14.098 --> 00:16.267
<i>Gangs are carving up territory.</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:18.978
(screams)

00:19.145 --> 00:20.355
We are running out of food.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.148
(shouting)

00:22.524 --> 00:23.441
<i>Ammunition.</i>

00:23.900 --> 00:25.902
We are surrounded
by hostile forces.

00:30.532 --> 00:32.784
Say hello to Butch.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.873
(screams)

00:39.624 --> 00:40.458
Put out the word.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.377
100,000 rounds of ammunition

00:42.544 --> 00:44.587
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

00:47.257 --> 00:48.341
(siren wails)

00:48.800 --> 00:49.801
<i>NURSE:
You want to cure her?</i>

00:50.051 --> 00:51.261
(whispering):
You have to go to the witch.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.346
And where do I find this witch?

00:54.556 --> 00:55.807
You have to help us.

00:56.266 --> 00:58.017
My brothers and sisters,

00:58.434 --> 00:59.435
they're killing us.

01:03.398 --> 01:05.024
GORDON:
His name is Will Thomas.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.609
Parents died in a home invasion

01:06.734 --> 01:08.570
a few weeks after the
bridges came down.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.029
Guys that broke in

01:10.196 --> 01:11.823
took him to some sort of factory

01:11.990 --> 01:14.826
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

01:15.326 --> 01:16.536
all chained together.

01:16.911 --> 01:17.912
BULLOCK:
God.

01:18.204 --> 01:19.455
Who are these guys?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.958
Call themselves
The Soothsayers.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.252
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

01:24.586 --> 01:26.045
But who can keep track
these days?

01:26.212 --> 01:28.339
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water,

01:28.464 --> 01:31.009
he said. Had them digging
some sort of tunnel.

01:31.301 --> 01:33.261
Will broke free
from his restraints last night

01:33.428 --> 01:36.264
and walked nine miles through
the Dark Zone to find us.

01:36.431 --> 01:37.849
What kind of tunnel?

01:38.099 --> 01:39.350
Unclear.

01:40.143 --> 01:44.022
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

01:44.856 --> 01:46.024
Detective Gordon?

01:48.943 --> 01:50.320
My friends.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.697
You'll save them, won't you?

01:53.990 --> 01:55.325
I'll look into it.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.411
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.788
They'll punish
the others for it.

02:02.332 --> 02:03.541
Please, Mr. Gordon.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.418
I promised them I'd bring help.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.007
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

02:11.174 --> 02:13.134
but need I remind you that
every two-bit criminal out there

02:13.301 --> 02:14.802
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.095
So you're saying
we do nothing?

02:16.262 --> 02:17.972
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

02:18.139 --> 02:19.223
someone's gonna
take a shot at you,

02:19.390 --> 02:20.600
and if it's not you
that's getting hit,

02:20.767 --> 02:22.185
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

02:22.352 --> 02:23.853
which is most likely
gonna be me.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.188
Captain.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.148
There's a call
from the mainland.

02:29.776 --> 02:30.735
<i>MAN:
All of us here believe</i>

02:30.902 --> 02:33.154
<i>that if peace is to be sustained
on the island,</i>

02:33.321 --> 02:34.989
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

02:35.281 --> 02:37.367
We have kids in danger
out there.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.494
We're their only hope
for rescue.

02:39.911 --> 02:41.913
MAN: <i>Your dedication to your
job is admirable, Captain,</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:43.581
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

02:43.748 --> 02:45.833
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:47.335
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing</i>

02:47.502 --> 02:50.088
<i>thousands of others
should you be killed.</i>

02:50.254 --> 02:52.590
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

02:52.757 --> 02:54.842
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

02:55.093 --> 02:56.803
I don't need opinions,
I need supplies.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.304
When can I expect them?

02:58.596 --> 03:01.099
MAN: <i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

03:01.265 --> 03:03.393
<i>we cannot sacrifice
any more pilots,</i>

03:03.559 --> 03:05.728
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

03:06.521 --> 03:08.648
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

03:08.815 --> 03:10.149
<i>MAN:
Mr. Gordon...</i>

03:17.198 --> 03:18.199
BULLOCK:
Jim.

03:20.076 --> 03:22.662
I need five men and transport
for 20 kids or more.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.330
We only have a few squad cars

03:24.497 --> 03:26.708
- and that rust bucket transporter.
- That'll have to do.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.709
How are we on ammo?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.043
Well, we got what we got
from Penguin,

03:29.210 --> 03:30.837
and we got a box
of shotgun shells

03:31.003 --> 03:31.963
and a box of nine mils.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.840
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.341
Do nothing,
protect the Green Zone.

03:35.883 --> 03:36.718
Four shells each.

03:36.968 --> 03:38.136
Half a mag each.

03:38.845 --> 03:40.388
Boy said The Soothsayers
are here.

03:40.555 --> 03:42.557
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

03:42.724 --> 03:44.392
but it's only three
or four miles from then on.

03:44.559 --> 03:46.310
Three or four miles
into the Dark Zone?

03:46.728 --> 03:48.104
God only knows what's out there.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.106
Barbara's been
stockpiling vehicles

03:50.273 --> 03:52.066
and everything else
as payment to enter her club.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.776
- It's worth a shot.
- She's gonna be thrilled

03:53.943 --> 03:56.154
to see you after what
happened with Tabitha.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.656
We're gonna need housing
for those kids when we get back.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.616
- Yep.
- If we get back.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.957

04:18.468 --> 04:20.678

05:57.066 --> 05:59.235
- Are you with her?
- Who?

06:00.361 --> 06:01.571
The witch.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.533
I'm not with the witch.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.993
I just came here
for her help.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.744
Come for her magic, have you?

06:09.412 --> 06:10.913
So did others from our district.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.456
And look at them now.

06:12.874 --> 06:14.041
They came for help, too,

06:14.208 --> 06:15.459
and she took their souls.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.087
But she'll never kill again.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.797
We have her this time.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.132
You captured her?

06:21.299 --> 06:22.800
She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.595
We stripped it clean
before we locked her in.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.764
The plants, you see.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.392
She talks to them.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.853
Makes them do things.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.900
So we took her light, water;
put salt on the floor.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.068
She's helpless now.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.361
I need to talk to her.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.572
No. We sent

06:44.739 --> 06:45.907
for more of us.

06:46.324 --> 06:49.118
When they come, we burn her.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.165
Listen.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.208
My brother is missing.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.085
I know this witch took him.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.463
I need to find out
what she did with him.

07:01.297 --> 07:03.466
Please, let me talk to her.
Five minutes is all I need,

07:03.633 --> 07:04.884
and then you can do
whatever you want.

07:05.718 --> 07:07.219
Your brother's dead.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.513
She'll kill you, too.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.891
Five minutes.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.355
In there.

Flaughs)

08:29.385 --> 08:31.804
A favor, right.
Is this after

08:31.971 --> 08:33.806
you stood by and did nothing

08:34.347 --> 08:35.890
while my best friend
on this Earth

08:36.058 --> 08:37.226
was stabbed through the heart?

08:37.393 --> 08:39.477
- I put him down.
- You restored his limp.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.188
- He should be dead!
- Barbara.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.898
Everybody out!

08:43.065 --> 08:45.317
_ Now!
' (musk Stops)

08:45.901 --> 08:47.653
I said move!

08:50.781 --> 08:52.158
Planning revenge?

08:53.075 --> 08:56.245
Well, someone has to do
something about that freak.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.707
He has an army.
It would be suicide.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.001
Look around, Jim.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.255
We're all slowly dying.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.592
Just some of us
get to choose how.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.471
I'm sorry about what happened
to Tabitha.

09:14.138 --> 09:15.556
Things got out of control.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.392
I'm just trying to keep
this city from falling apart.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.610
You're too late.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.408
So, this favor?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.037
I need transportation.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.915
- Trucks, maybe.
- Where are you going?

09:41.082 --> 09:42.917
- It's a police matter.
- (laughs softly)

09:45.252 --> 09:48.130
You know, they should really
write that on your tombstone.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.549

09:50.716 --> 09:52.134
They're downstairs
in the basement lot.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.469
Knock yourself out.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.847
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.100
You won't last the night.

turned its back on us.

10:53.529 --> 10:54.905
I wonder what's left here now.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.657
I doubt many stayed up here.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.785

never regained power.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.726
Welcome to the badlands.

Come on.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.461

11:50.628 --> 11:52.046

'Aah!

11:52.213 --> 11:53.422
Come on!

11:53.797 --> 11:54.757
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

11:54.924 --> 11:56.217
Leave him alone.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.137
Causing trouble again,
Gabriel?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.057
We need water and food.
Some of us haven't slept

12:03.224 --> 12:04.767
in two days.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.269
You know, you could've woken me

12:07.436 --> 12:09.772
when that sneaky rat left
in the night.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.360
But you didn't,
and now, he's out there,

12:14.526 --> 12:16.695
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.080
(exhales)
The smoke.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.748
You should take it.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.959
It'll give you energy.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.294
Inhale enough...

12:33.921 --> 12:35.756
...and it'll let you
see the future.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.556
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.476
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

12:47.685 --> 12:50.646
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.149
People will be forced
to do business with us.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.777
Food, booze, guns,

12:57.403 --> 12:58.570
smoke.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.992
All will come from the tunnel.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.286
We've been digging
for over a month.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.870
We've only gotten
a hundred feet.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.664
It's too narrow.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.041
The roof is leaking. Once we hit
the river, it'll flood

13:11.208 --> 13:13.252
- and kill anyone inside.
- So negative!

13:13.460 --> 13:14.586
Gabriel.

13:15.129 --> 13:16.046
Shame.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.383
I had such high hopes for you.

13:20.301 --> 13:24.263
That one day you would
wear the mask and share

13:24.430 --> 13:26.265
in our good fortune.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.183
Never mind.

13:29.226 --> 13:29.893
MAN:
Sykes.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.520
Man, you got
to come out front.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.201
Who was on watch?!

13:46.952 --> 13:48.370
GORDON:
Put your weapons down.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.001
Is that James Gordon?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.213
The James Gordon?

14:01.216 --> 14:02.885
It's our lucky day, fellas.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.262
Kill this one,
and we're bullet rich!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.474
In Penguin's graces we will be.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.601
(guns clicking)

14:15.856 --> 14:17.024
I said put 'em down.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.079
Give us the kids

14:30.245 --> 14:31.997
you're holding captive.
We'll leave.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.457
Kids?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.085
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.295
What are the cattle prods for?

14:41.340 --> 14:42.466
Fun.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.517
Stay here.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.936
He moves, kill him.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.240
It's okay.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.450
It's all right.
I'm a cop.

15:10.661 --> 15:11.829
Will's alive?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.581
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

15:14.748 --> 15:15.707
He did.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.501
Will made it! He's alive!

15:17.626 --> 15:20.003
- (cheering)
- We need the keys.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.923
There are trucks outside.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.092
We'll drive you
to the Green Zone,

15:25.717 --> 15:26.635
find you a new home.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.303
Thank you.
God bless you.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.598
Okay, guys. We're gonna
get out of here.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.642
Gonna help us get out.
One at a time.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.019
Yeah, we're
gonna be okay.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.606
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

15:39.857 --> 15:42.443
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

15:42.609 --> 15:46.029
so it was either this
or sexy nurse.

15:51.034 --> 15:51.910
You know what?

15:52.161 --> 15:55.789
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.792
Wrong.
Penguin gave us a boatload.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.336
Penguin wants your
boss skinned.

16:01.670 --> 16:02.921
Let's take 'em, boys.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.800
Come on! Go! Go!

16:06.967 --> 16:08.552
(gunfire)

16:08.719 --> 16:09.761
(Bullock yells)

16:14.892 --> 16:17.060
(gunfire continues)

16:20.772 --> 16:21.482
Hey!

16:23.150 --> 16:23.942
Go!

16:24.109 --> 16:25.319
(child screams)

16:25.402 --> 16:26.987
Gabriel!

16:30.282 --> 16:31.992
You okay? Come on.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.835
- Take cover! Go! Go!
- (whimpers)

16:45.380 --> 16:47.966
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

16:58.769 --> 17:00.354
(yelling)

17:15.327 --> 17:16.744
(gasps softly)

17:19.705 --> 17:20.499
Bruce?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.209
(sighs)

17:22.501 --> 17:23.877
Thank God.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.172
You have to help me.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.386
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

17:32.553 --> 17:34.263
- you have to believe me.
- You'll forgive me

17:34.471 --> 17:36.181
if I find it hard to do so.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.102
It wasn't me.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.564
It was the park.

17:43.981 --> 17:44.982
The park?

17:45.148 --> 17:49.069
The trees,
the plants, the roots

17:49.236 --> 17:50.362
underground...

17:51.321 --> 17:53.198
They're speaking to one another.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.326
When those men came
to kill me...

17:56.493 --> 17:57.995
(panting)

17:58.161 --> 18:00.330
...the plants came
to my protection.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.670
Then maybe
we can help each other.

18:07.546 --> 18:08.797
I have...

18:10.007 --> 18:12.551
a friend... who was shot.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.303
The bullet severed
her spinal cord.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.138
The doctors can't
seem to help her.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.099
But a woman at the hospital said
that you might be able to.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.436
Normally, I would say no.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.232
But this park...
ever since we were cut off

18:27.399 --> 18:29.901
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.196
There are things growing here

18:33.363 --> 18:34.781
I have never seen before.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.742
- (knocking) - MAN:
You okay in there?

18:37.367 --> 18:38.744
Our friends are
on their way.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.996
Time's running out
for you, witch!

18:44.291 --> 18:45.375
There's a seed.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.838
It's growing under the oaks.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.342
It's said
to have magical qualities.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.135
When digested, it heads

18:55.302 --> 18:57.220
for damaged tissue and bone,
healing them.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.682
If I help you find it...

19:02.893 --> 19:05.228
...will you protect me
from those men out there?

19:21.703 --> 19:22.663
(gasps)

19:27.542 --> 19:29.211
(chains rattle)

19:31.713 --> 19:34.466
Yes! Yes!

19:34.716 --> 19:36.051
Yes, it worked!

19:36.635 --> 19:39.221
No... more...

19:39.388 --> 19:41.348
sleepwalking for me.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.475
(sighs)

19:44.267 --> 19:45.560
Good morning.

19:49.606 --> 19:50.273
(zipper opens)

19:50.440 --> 19:51.483
(sighs)

19:51.983 --> 19:54.194
See, it was just some...

19:55.320 --> 19:57.197
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.157
(urinating)

19:59.324 --> 20:00.909
It's all in your head.

20:06.665 --> 20:09.418
(man groaning)

20:16.550 --> 20:17.968
There's nothing there.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.263
Flaughs)

20:23.265 --> 20:25.308
(sighs)

20:25.809 --> 20:27.352
(man groaning)

20:32.190 --> 20:32.858
(Zipper closes)

20:35.902 --> 20:38.196
-(gasps)
- Who the hell are you?

20:39.781 --> 20:41.992
What? Are you serious?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.118
Very.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.745
You don't remember?

20:44.995 --> 20:46.872
- No.
- Oh.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.957
Name's Tank.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.836
You're part of
the Street Demonz gang?

20:54.171 --> 20:54.963
Yeah.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.214
You know that.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.049
Why should I?

20:59.718 --> 21:00.886
What are you doing here?

21:01.636 --> 21:03.138
You brought me here.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.599
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.186
Did I, uh...

21:09.352 --> 21:11.146
hit you, et cetera?

21:13.774 --> 21:15.150
Any idea why?

21:15.859 --> 21:17.068
You wanted information,

21:17.569 --> 21:19.279
and I wouldn't give it to you.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.241
I'm gonna guess
you gave it to me.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.870
Huh. I can't remember.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.374
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

21:32.501 --> 21:33.794
Guess so.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.296
Fine.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.551
SYKES: Gordon,
where are you?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.345
We need to hide.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.140
Follow me.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.147
(door creaks closed)

21:59.194 --> 22:00.403
It's not safe out there.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.074
We've got to get out
of the daylight.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.951
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

22:06.451 --> 22:07.452
We'll be fine.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.037
Jim, we're not alone.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.915
Someone lit that candle.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.628
In the old west, settlers used
to leave a candle burning

22:16.795 --> 22:18.588
to lead others to safety.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.841
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

22:22.551 --> 22:23.301
All right, fine.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.761
We'll take a look around.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.347
Stay here.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.016
If you see something, shout.

22:32.853 --> 22:33.645
Radio check.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.564
Ah, forget it.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.816
We're out of range of
the precinct's antenna.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.277
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

22:40.569 --> 22:42.445
maybe they'll send someone back
here to get us, huh?

22:42.612 --> 22:45.323
Maybe. Until then, I'll take the
next floor, you do the basement.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.702
Oh. Check out the basement
in a creepy hotel by myself?

22:48.869 --> 22:49.661
Sure.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.288
What could go wrong, right?

22:53.915 --> 22:55.250
(sighs)

23:01.256 --> 23:02.340
Let's get settled.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.562
(floorboards creaking)

23:25.947 --> 23:27.782
(door creaks)

23:38.376 --> 23:40.211
(creaking nearby)

23:43.089 --> 23:44.299
Hello?

23:49.179 --> 23:50.722
Is somebody there?

23:52.223 --> 23:53.308
GCPD.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.191
Come out, now.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.656
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's all right.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.496
(fire crackling)

24:28.593 --> 24:30.178
<i>IS'</i>

24:40.271 --> 24:41.523
Oh, my God.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.609
Oh. Not good.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.111
Oh, God. This...

24:46.361 --> 24:47.404
This is not good.

24:47.612 --> 24:51.032
(shouts) Jim!

24:54.494 --> 24:57.664
(grunts, groans)

24:58.832 --> 25:01.459
Fine. I'll tell you.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.588
You wanted to know where the
Street Demonz base was.

25:06.589 --> 25:07.257
That's it?

25:07.424 --> 25:09.759
And you wanted to be sure
the boss would be there.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.219
Emmanuel Vasquez?

25:12.053 --> 25:12.887
Yeah.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.475
Okay. How did I seem?

25:17.642 --> 25:20.895
Was I confident, flamboyant,

25:21.062 --> 25:22.147
charisma for days?

25:22.313 --> 25:23.398
Or a little more conservative,

25:23.565 --> 25:25.150
kind of repressed,
a little nerdy?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.445
You seemed stiff,
man of few words.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.613
In a daze, actually.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.075
Interesting.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.828
Okay, let's go.

25:37.412 --> 25:38.496
Where?

25:39.039 --> 25:40.457
To where you
told me to go.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.292
To the Street Demonz' base.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.294
To Vasquez.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.213
I want to know why I went there.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.393
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside. Lock the door.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.686
Stay calm.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.897
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

26:04.647 --> 26:05.607
She's a witch,

26:05.774 --> 26:07.233
and will burn for
what she's done.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.110
I take full responsibility
for her.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.737
If she's done what you say,

26:10.904 --> 26:12.405
she will pay
for her crimes, but...

26:19.287 --> 26:22.082
You are so utterly naive.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.958
You didn't have to kill them.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.585
I wanted to.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.712
Why are you here?

26:28.671 --> 26:30.090
I'm here for my friend.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.758
Our friend.

26:32.383 --> 26:33.259
Selina.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.304
Selina's the one that's hurt?

26:36.471 --> 26:38.890
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

26:42.018 --> 26:42.685
Good.

26:44.104 --> 26:47.357
That bitch destroyed the last
of the Lazarus Water.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.735
Let her suffer.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.279
I don't believe
you mean that.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.115
You've known each
other for a long time.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.783
You grew up on the
streets together.

27:00.662 --> 27:04.666
You know, I wasn't lying when
I said this park is changing.

27:05.041 --> 27:08.837
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

27:09.796 --> 27:14.134
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.596
I think I shall plant

27:18.763 --> 27:21.432
your body in the ground, Bruce.

27:23.935 --> 27:26.312
What will grow from you,
I wonder?

27:28.148 --> 27:30.358
Those men you killed were right.

27:31.776 --> 27:32.819
You are a witch.

27:33.444 --> 27:37.198
A murderous,
callous witch.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.577
Trying to bait me, boy?

27:40.743 --> 27:42.412
I wouldn't waste my breath.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.915
I can see there's
no good left in you.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.001
If you were trying to
help this park flourish,

27:48.168 --> 27:50.378
it would be full
of beauty and color.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.797
Instead it smells of death.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.968
It's a work in progress.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.262
It's a nightmare.

28:01.806 --> 28:05.852
If I do help you,
you'll leave me alone?

28:09.772 --> 28:10.940
Follow me.

28:18.948 --> 28:19.741
It's okay.

28:19.908 --> 28:20.909
I'm Jim. What's your name?

28:21.075 --> 28:22.994
L-I can't remember.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.205
Where are your parents?

28:25.413 --> 28:26.289
Dead.

28:26.581 --> 28:27.916
When the lights went
out in the city,

28:28.124 --> 28:29.751
a gang came,
they murdered them.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.085
Iran.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.545
She found me.

28:32.962 --> 28:33.630
Who?

28:34.297 --> 28:35.298
The ghost.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.383
She was kind at first.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.385
But she can be very cruel.

28:39.719 --> 28:40.845
BULLOCK:
Jim!

28:41.304 --> 28:42.555
We're not alone.
There's a crazy woman.

28:42.764 --> 28:43.806
She's killing people.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.391
The ghost.
We got to go.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.143
- She hates strangers.
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.519
We'll protect you
from whoever she is.

28:48.686 --> 28:49.479
You can't.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.105
Why? Who is she?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.734
She makes me call her Mother.

28:54.901 --> 28:55.568
We got to go.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.862
He's not lying!
Come on, Jim.

29:04.911 --> 29:05.828
Hey!

29:06.579 --> 29:07.330
Hey!

29:07.664 --> 29:08.915
Come on!

29:09.207 --> 29:10.667
_ K-
_ (pQLlndinlgdfi)

29:15.880 --> 29:16.714
Hey, kid!

29:17.090 --> 29:18.424
The lights will make you dizzy.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.009
And then you'll fall asleep.

29:22.387 --> 29:23.513
You won't feel a thing.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.933
(groaning)

29:30.353 --> 29:32.272
Jim, I don't feel so good.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.196
(grunts)

29:42.740 --> 29:43.866
(door rattling)

29:46.494 --> 29:48.538
BOY: You can't fight it.
Give in to it.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.502
BULLOCK:
Jim!

30:08.182 --> 30:09.434
(grunts)

30:10.184 --> 30:13.396
- Who are you?
- I'm the only mother that boy knows.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.315
You're a crazy bitch
who kills people,

30:15.481 --> 30:17.400
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.110
I'm protecting him.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.405
When I found him,
he was barely alive.

30:22.572 --> 30:23.740
Those animals out there,

30:23.906 --> 30:25.658
they would have
killed him or worse.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.202
I taught him how to survive.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.996
(both grunting)

30:35.209 --> 30:36.127
Hey!

30:51.100 --> 30:52.185
Where is everybody?

30:52.685 --> 30:53.436
Beats me.

30:53.603 --> 30:54.687
Come on.

31:02.695 --> 31:03.571
Oh, boy.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.865
TANK:
Holy crap.

31:07.367 --> 31:08.785
That's Vasquez.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.080
Did you do this?

31:13.790 --> 31:15.458
Honestly, I don't remember.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.127
What about that?

31:21.839 --> 31:23.216
Penguin did this.

31:24.425 --> 31:25.802
I think not.

31:26.469 --> 31:30.473
Well, whoever did
just started one hell of a war.

31:47.490 --> 31:49.367
<i>IS'</i>

32:14.559 --> 32:15.518
Here.

32:29.282 --> 32:30.533
Is that human blood?

32:30.700 --> 32:31.784
(laughs softly)

32:32.410 --> 32:34.996
If Selina ingests this, it'll
find its way to her wound.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.039
Its roots will wrap around
her spine,

32:37.206 --> 32:39.333
fusing the nerves
and cartilage together.

32:40.793 --> 32:41.836
It'll cure her?

32:42.753 --> 32:43.754
Maybe.

32:45.006 --> 32:45.756
Just maybe?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.216
Everyone's different.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.885
Depends
on how strong she is.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.430
One thing
is for sure though--

32:53.097 --> 32:54.765
the seed
will alter her forever.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.101
- How?
- Some say

32:57.268 --> 33:00.438
the darker angels of our nature
are unlocked and set free.

33:05.318 --> 33:06.444
Can she live with that?

33:10.573 --> 33:11.407
Can you?

33:11.574 --> 33:13.326
I don't know
if there's any other way.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.912
Then go.
Give it to her.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.665
What's the matter, Bruce?

33:21.083 --> 33:23.127
Don't know
if you can trust me?

33:27.381 --> 33:28.925
- I don't.
- Good.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.843
Then you're finally
becoming a man.

33:37.642 --> 33:40.353
- Where will you go?
- Where I'm going is none of your business.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.313
Best hurry.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.900
That root will die if left out
in the open for too long.

33:53.950 --> 33:54.951
Uh...

33:55.117 --> 33:56.911
Where have you guys been?
You've been gone for a while.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.955
Chasing ghosts.
They're like rats

33:59.121 --> 34:00.206
in the walls.
This whole place is

34:00.373 --> 34:02.250
their spiderweb. Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.377
We got to go. Not everyone
wants your help,

34:04.544 --> 34:05.670
Jim Gordon.

34:06.337 --> 34:07.838
Detective Gordon,
your hand's bleeding.

34:09.465 --> 34:10.632
We need to leave.

34:11.175 --> 34:12.176
Come on.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.219
(dog barking in distance)

34:14.428 --> 34:15.721
How many bullets
you got left?

34:16.054 --> 34:16.806
Two.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.109
(ignition sputtering)

34:28.275 --> 34:30.319
(engine revving)

34:40.329 --> 34:41.871
SYKES:
Looky here, boys!

34:43.916 --> 34:44.875
I'll tell you what,

34:46.377 --> 34:48.254
you give me
my workers back,

34:48.963 --> 34:50.922
and I'll let you
and your partner go.

34:56.846 --> 34:58.055
I'm just kidding.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.682
Of course I'm not gonna do that.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.475
I'm gonna kill you all!

35:03.894 --> 35:05.187
WOMAN:
Wait just a minute,

35:05.771 --> 35:06.981
please.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.278
The prize for
this man's head

35:12.612 --> 35:13.571
is mine.

35:25.666 --> 35:26.709
How is she?

35:27.918 --> 35:28.669
Not great.

35:29.754 --> 35:30.504
I mean,
she hasn't said a peep

35:30.671 --> 35:31.714
since you've been gone.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.468
You all right?

35:35.801 --> 35:36.969
Did you find the witch?

35:38.179 --> 35:39.639
It was Ivy.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.062
What's that?

35:46.395 --> 35:48.189
Ivy said it could
help Selina.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.274
What, and you trust her?

35:50.441 --> 35:51.776
What choice do I have?

35:52.234 --> 35:54.528
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

35:54.695 --> 35:57.031
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-hearted killer.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.450
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

36:05.623 --> 36:07.166
Selina, I have doubts.

36:08.751 --> 36:11.087
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

36:11.462 --> 36:12.880
Nothing's changed since then.

36:13.047 --> 36:16.050
So if Ivy wants
to kill me,

36:17.259 --> 36:18.594
she can have at it.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.229
What do I do,
just swallow it?

36:28.896 --> 36:29.730
Yeah.

36:43.411 --> 36:44.620
(sighs)

36:46.497 --> 36:47.707
Still here.

36:47.957 --> 36:48.958
(chuckles)

36:53.421 --> 36:56.298
I know lvy's lost her mind.

36:56.590 --> 36:57.550
But...

36:58.217 --> 36:59.719
after her mom and dad died,

37:00.010 --> 37:01.387
she was just...

37:02.012 --> 37:03.264
sleeping on the streets.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.684
And it was
a cold winter, and...

37:07.309 --> 37:09.437
she started
to get really sick.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.064
Sol...

37:14.775 --> 37:17.361
took her under my wing, I guess,

37:19.488 --> 37:20.448
and...

37:20.781 --> 37:22.616
showed her where to get food,

37:23.909 --> 37:26.036
where to get a roof
over her head.

37:28.122 --> 37:28.831
And after some time,

37:28.998 --> 37:30.666
she started to get color
in her face.

37:32.501 --> 37:33.544
(chuckles)

37:35.463 --> 37:36.964
And I just...

37:37.757 --> 37:39.633
kept checking in on her.

37:41.761 --> 37:43.471
Almost every day.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.518
She may look old now, but...

37:50.478 --> 37:52.897
she'll always be
that little girl to me.

37:59.195 --> 38:00.738
(shuddering)

38:00.905 --> 38:02.323
- No, no, no, Selina.
- ALFRED: Doctor!

38:02.531 --> 38:03.908
- Selina.
- Doctor!

38:04.074 --> 38:05.034
Selina, stay with me.

38:05.201 --> 38:07.286
- (whimpering)
- Stay back. Give us room.

38:07.536 --> 38:08.537
No, Selina.

38:09.205 --> 38:10.664
DOCTOR:
She's burning up.

38:11.665 --> 38:13.292
Pulse is low. What happened?

38:13.584 --> 38:15.211
Oh, God, what have I done?

38:19.340 --> 38:20.800
Put it down, Knucklehead!

38:21.133 --> 38:23.844
You two clowns ain't got
a single bullet between you.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.095
Wrong.

38:25.429 --> 38:26.472
I got two.

38:27.723 --> 38:28.557
Prove it.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.726
I won't say it
again, freak.

38:30.935 --> 38:33.354
Gordon comes with me.

38:33.771 --> 38:34.939
I'll tell you what!

38:35.606 --> 38:37.191
I'll take his head,
and you can have

38:37.358 --> 38:38.567
the rest of him!

38:44.198 --> 38:46.534
<i>IS'</i>

38:51.121 --> 38:52.289
(vehicle approaching)

39:14.520 --> 39:15.437
Hi, Jim.

39:16.272 --> 39:17.773
About our last chat...

39:19.608 --> 39:21.527
...I may have been
a little rash.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.029
This what got you
all hot and bothered?

39:24.196 --> 39:26.198
- They need a bath.
- Crazy bi...

39:34.206 --> 39:35.291
Wow.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.793
Your last bullet,
just for me, huh?

39:39.336 --> 39:40.504
Must be love.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.590
Not all square yet though.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.968
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.261
Oh, yeah? What's that?

39:48.220 --> 39:49.722
Kill Penguin.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.810
How 'bout we table this
until I can get them safely

39:54.977 --> 39:56.770
into the Green Zone, huh?
Come on.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.240
Wow.

40:09.491 --> 40:10.993
You're safe now. Go on.

40:11.869 --> 40:13.078
LUCIUS:
You made it.

40:13.746 --> 40:14.955
You had me worried.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.583
All sorts of chatter out there
about people hunting

40:17.750 --> 40:19.376
you down for Penguin's
reward money.

40:19.919 --> 40:21.420
Well, they'll just have
to try harder.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.715
He did have help from
the unlikeliest of places.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.717
You're welcome.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.470
Show me what you got.

40:30.721 --> 40:31.639
Nice place.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.892
250 apartments.
Running water, hot and cold.

40:35.142 --> 40:36.810
Gas. No electricity yet.

40:37.061 --> 40:38.103
Is there a bar?

40:41.398 --> 40:43.192
LUCIUS: Once the kids
we liberated moved in,

40:43.359 --> 40:44.777
word got out pretty fast
that there was

40:44.944 --> 40:46.403
a safe place
to live in the city.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.989
Citizens are heading here
in droves.

40:50.950 --> 40:53.410
This place will be full
by sundown.

40:55.329 --> 40:56.538
Then we'll find another.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.208
I just want to thank you,
Captain Gordon.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.086
My family, we've been drifting
from one place to the next

41:02.252 --> 41:03.545
ever since
the blackout.

41:04.296 --> 41:05.506
You've delivered us.

41:09.969 --> 41:11.303
Seriously?

41:11.929 --> 41:13.514
I'll see you around, killer.

41:14.556 --> 41:16.976
We have some unfinished
business, you and l.

41:19.311 --> 41:22.022
DOCTOR: Whatever she took
put her body into shock.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.440
Her temperature
skyrocketed.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.776
Her WBC count was
off the charts.

41:25.901 --> 41:30.197
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.282
I have no idea why.

41:32.408 --> 41:36.078
She was still in a lot of
pain, so we sedated her.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.038
She's been sleeping
for a while now.

41:38.205 --> 41:40.666
I think it'd be best to
come back in the morning.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.502
Thank you, Doctor.

41:47.006 --> 41:48.424
Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should,

41:48.590 --> 41:49.341
uh...

41:50.801 --> 41:51.844
we should get
some shut-eye.

41:53.095 --> 41:54.054
Come on.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.359
<i>IS'</i>

42:18.996 --> 42:20.205
Bruce.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.964
It's a miracle.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.093
How do you feel?

42:33.260 --> 42:35.512
(wind blowing)

42:37.931 --> 42:39.224
Different.

42:41.351 --> 42:42.144
Any pain?

42:43.145 --> 42:43.979
No.

42:47.483 --> 42:49.526
Selina, I thought
I'd killed you.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.571
I'm better.

42:55.282 --> 42:57.659
Even better than before,
in fact.
