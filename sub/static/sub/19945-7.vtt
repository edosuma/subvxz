WEBVTT

00:46.964 --> 00:49.383
Negative gun energy may not stay.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.136
I release you and send you on your way.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.056
Go on now. Get out of here.
On your way.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.101
I'm not done yet.

00:59.184 --> 01:05.482
Negative gun energy, I banish thee,
and is my word so mote it be!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.734
Mote? Don't you mean "might"?

01:07.818 --> 01:10.904
"Might"? Grace, no, no.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.281
It's "mote."

01:12.698 --> 01:14.575
You'd be laughed right out of the coven.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.951
What does "mote" mean?

01:16.034 --> 01:16.952
Might.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.455
-Are we done?
-Almost.

01:20.539 --> 01:24.001
- Ah... Ah...
- Oh, don't-- Why do you do that?!

01:24.084 --> 01:26.586
I've told you,
it's dangerous to hold a sneeze in.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.006
I'm not a pretty sneezer.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.842
Well, the face you make holding it in
isn't pretty, either.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.343
Well, thanks for telling me.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.761
That's what I'm here for.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.682
We have saged every inch of this house.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.475
You told me when we were through

01:40.559 --> 01:43.353
we could go over the talking points
for our interview.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.479
I know.

01:44.563 --> 01:48.567
I've done my homework about all
our talking points and I've got a plan.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.860
Oh, what is it?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.445
We're gonna wing it.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.946
We're not winging anything.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.450
We're going to over-prepare
and then act like we're winging it.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.909
To each her own.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.369
So mote it be.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.080
I'm gonna take a shower.
I smell like a brush fire.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.749
I'm gonna purify this chair

02:03.832 --> 02:07.711
because it would've been the last thing
I saw before you shot me.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.380
-Ah-- Ah-- Ah--
-Let it out! Let it out. Let it out.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.427
-What's the matter? Are you okay?
-My back!

02:15.510 --> 02:17.346
Oh, God. What can I do?

02:17.429 --> 02:20.140
- No, no, no! Don't do that!
- Here.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.225
-Let me get you into a chair.
-No!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.852
On the floor! The floor!

02:25.354 --> 02:26.480
Oh, wait. Oh...

02:27.356 --> 02:28.523
-Ah! Yes.
-You all right?

02:28.607 --> 02:29.733
What?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.652
Oh, my back, back, back!

02:31.735 --> 02:32.903
That's not funny.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.196
I'm serious!

02:34.279 --> 02:35.238
Oh, don't go down.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.032
-Oh, I'm going!
-Don't go down!

02:37.115 --> 02:38.742
-I'm going!
-Don't go down!

02:38.825 --> 02:40.118
-Oh, I'm down.
-No.

02:48.668 --> 02:52.089
Oh. I thought you were going
to breakfast with Brianna and Mallory.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.883
I am, but they don't have Pop-Tarts there.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.511
-So you're gonna sit there and not eat?
-No, I'm gonna eat.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.181
-Ate the last one, huh?
-No, I did not.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.768
I... went to the store.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.605
Good. When you're done with them
you can live in the empty boxes.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.567
Look, man...
I'm looking for a place, okay?

03:12.651 --> 03:14.361
I've got ten solid leads right now.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.654
-Leads?
-Yeah.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.447
Looking for an apartment
or trying to solve a crime?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.409
Maybe both.
Some of these places are a little sketchy.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.161
But I'm all over it, man.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.915
Well, do you need any help?
Because, uh...

03:26.998 --> 03:29.126
I'm good at this kind of stuff
and you're...

03:30.001 --> 03:32.754
-I'm good at this kind of stuff.
-I've got it covered. Okay?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.506
Ye of little faith.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.593
Hot! Hot, fuck.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.766
I always forget.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.395
What just happened?

03:48.478 --> 03:51.398
I believe we've fallen
and we can't get up.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.526
No, my back.
What just happened to my back?

03:55.026 --> 03:57.279
You hurt it trying to help me.

03:57.362 --> 04:01.158
I just read an article
about how this happens all the time.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.162
There was this guy who was trying
to get his wife out of a bathtub

04:05.245 --> 04:06.538
and they both drowned.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.166
Oh, that is a terrible story!

04:09.249 --> 04:10.667
Oh, it gets worse.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.421
I expect this kind of thing from my wrists
and my ankles and my knees...

04:14.504 --> 04:15.797
and my hips.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.550
But my back was never like those assholes.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.763
I wouldn't do that.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.015
This isn't gonna work for me, Frankie.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.561
We have a meeting with Marla at 4:00.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.521
Oh, no.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.732
If your pain could talk,
what would it say?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.192
It just said, "Ah!"

04:35.275 --> 04:37.444
Oh, that's muscle pain.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.697
Mine is a disc problem,
which is way worse.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.366
I thought you were against
competitive victimization.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.327
Only when I'm losing.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.620
Where's your Skeflaxin?

04:46.703 --> 04:50.290
In my studio with my Tiger Balm
and my Backnobber III.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.586
Hell, your Backnobber III is at the bottom
of the pool with your Backnobber II.

04:54.669 --> 04:58.089
Okay, it's in my studio
with my Tiger Balm.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.426
Look, we're gonna have to get somebody
over here to get us some drugs,

05:01.510 --> 05:05.180
get us off the floor,
and maybe put on our lipstick.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.516
Oh, you don't have
to put on lipstick for me.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.601
For the meeting...

05:09.684 --> 05:13.021
with the website
that took me weeks to schedule!

05:13.104 --> 05:15.816
Oh, you are a tenacious
little prairie dog.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.067
Hey, where's your phone?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.527
Over there.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.029
Oh, you're gonna have
to be more specific.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.741
In my studio.
Next to my Skeflaxin and Tiger Balm.

05:24.825 --> 05:29.496
You'll pass the landline on your way.
You might as well stop and use that.

05:29.579 --> 05:33.291
That's the best idea you've had
since Irish coffee popsicles.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.877
I don't want to miss the meeting, either.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.630
You're in my path.
I'm going to have to roll over you.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.299
Oh, you know me, I'll try anything once.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.385
Oh... Ah!

05:43.468 --> 05:44.553
-Oh, God.
-Ow! Ow!

05:46.054 --> 05:49.015
One of your bones is jabbing my breast.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.809
Yeah, well right back at you, sister.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.229
-Oh, Grace.
-What?

05:54.312 --> 05:59.442
I probably don't say this often enough,
but you are a striking woman.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.319
Oh, thank you.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.659
Look at this beautiful fruit salad.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.578
I've really outdone my bad self.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.038
Oh, yeah? Check this out.

06:12.831 --> 06:13.665
Gorgeous.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.795
This is shaping up to be
a very gay brunch.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.756
Might as well go all the way.
Wine spritzers?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.051
Maybe we should butch it up
with some Bloody Marys.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.096
Not with your heartburn, we can't.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.181
Ah, no. Of course not.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.310
We'll just leave out the horseradish.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.895
And the tomato juice. And the hot sauce.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.232
-Yeah, we'll leave those out, too.
-Then it's just vodka.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.942
That's all I really wanted.

06:42.235 --> 06:47.991
Did you really have heartburn last night
or was it something else?

06:48.074 --> 06:50.160
Sweetheart, it was just a bad night.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.413
Trust me, it wasn't you.
I just wasn't feeling well.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.875
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.376
I'll get it.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.300
-John.
-Robert.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.135
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.472
-Sol.
-John.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.017
Oh, God, your house is beautiful.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.436
Thank you.
Thank you guys for having me over.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.105
Well, I think the rule is...

07:19.606 --> 07:24.361
when you burst in and start screaming
like a crazy person at an ex-priest

07:24.444 --> 07:27.280
who's only giving water
to his golden retriever,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.824
you gotta have that man over for brunch.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.493
Well, I'm glad to be here.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.997
But can this mark the end
of the rambling apology calls?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.374
-Absolutely.
-Probably not.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.380
Are you gonna call 911?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.549
911? God, no! That's for emergencies.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.843
Oh, then I'll check back
with you tomorrow.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.012
-What about Jacob?
-No, no, no.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.973
He thinks I'm a powerful goddess.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.891
-He can't see me like this.
-Oh, God.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.020
So we'll call your boys.
Isn't that what sons are for?

07:59.104 --> 08:01.898
No, I can't call Coyote.
He doesn't have a car.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.068
And as you know,
Bud is not in the mood for enmeshment.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.278
Plus, his back is not great.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.114
What about your girls?

08:09.197 --> 08:13.868
My girls just told me I was at the age
when children start caring for parents.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.121
I will not prove them right.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.915
Well, we'll just have to call Rudy
at Rudy's Pizza.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.460
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer Rudy not see me like this.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.421
Oh, believe me. He's seen worse.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.464
You think I've never been
stuck in the tub?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.888
Uh, Frankie...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.435
this is the TV remote.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.105
Oh, great. I could use
some<i> River Monsters</i> right about now.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.899
Why is the TV remote in the phone cradle?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.693
So I'll remember where it is.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.737
Well, how do you remember
where the phone is?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.530
With great difficulty.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.157
In case you haven't noticed,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.910
people don't even know
who we are or what we are selling.

08:55.994 --> 08:59.205
This meeting is the first chance
we've had at distribution!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.833
It's okay, I'm with you. Don't flip out.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.170
Just hit the pager button thingy
on the base thingy.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.557
Fuck me in the eye.

09:19.476 --> 09:23.521
The thing is, guys,
I can't argue with anything Bud said.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.690
What about the stuff he said
about your music?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.692
He said he can't argue with it.
Let's just--

09:27.776 --> 09:29.569
No, he's right about everything.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.323
Yes, it's time I find my own place.
I need to get my own life.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.160
Hey, you're only 35.
I mean, what's the rush?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.996
Okay, there has to be
some place decent in your price range.

09:40.080 --> 09:40.914
Oh, you bet.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.626
Fo sho. Checking out
a great sitch this afternoon.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.045
What kind of sitch?

09:47.128 --> 09:51.174
Well, it's the bottom floor
of an older gentleman's house,

09:51.257 --> 09:54.052
and he asked me
if I enjoy giving back rubs.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.846
Lucky for both of us, I do.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.766
Okay. All right,
my friend Debbie has a brother named Kevin

09:59.849 --> 10:03.478
and he lives with four guys
in one of those old Victorian shitholes.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.938
What about your mom's yurt?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.524
-It exploded.
-What?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.859
Did you not hear about the explosion?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.528
-It was on the news, right?
-Yeah.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.155
How did I not know about this?

10:14.239 --> 10:17.951
Anyway, I saw this ad this morning.
I thought I could go check that out.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.037
"Albert 'The Duke' Dukmejian's
real estate.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.456
The expert in affordable
alternative living."

10:23.540 --> 10:26.501
I like "affordable,"
and you're definitely "alternative."

10:27.085 --> 10:29.212
Great, let's go check out this sitch.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.758
Or, more likely, have a man
named "The Duke" show us his penis.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.388
We can do a watermelon spritzer,
grapefruit spritzer...

10:38.471 --> 10:41.099
-I can even do strawberry.
-What are you having?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.184
-Just straight vodka.
-I'll have that.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.146
Okay, I'll drink my fizzy wine alone.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.858
-It is so peaceful back here.
-Yeah, yeah...

10:50.608 --> 10:53.987
So, listen,
when you were in the confessional

10:54.571 --> 10:57.824
did anyone ever tell you about seeing,
you know...

10:59.117 --> 11:00.952
people who aren't there...

11:01.661 --> 11:05.331
um, ghosts or apparitions, spirits even?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.543
I was really hoping to talk
about the Chargers, but, uh...

11:09.752 --> 11:11.212
go ahead, my son.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.548
Okay. So last night, Sol and I--

11:13.631 --> 11:16.301
Well, we were in the bedroom
and we were just a--

11:16.384 --> 11:19.012
John. Sorry. Rocks or neat?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.598
It doesn't matter, Sol,
just fill them up to the top.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.516
Uh, rocks for me.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.393
Everything okay?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.604
Yeah, we're just talking
about the Chargers.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.689
You know, football.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.900
Oh, carry on.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.403
Look, I know this sounds crazy...

11:36.237 --> 11:39.073
but just as Sol and I were about to,
you know--

11:39.157 --> 11:44.162
Again, I know it's crazy,
but I saw a vision of my mother.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.330
Where?

11:45.413 --> 11:48.791
She was sitting in her wheelchair,
right here in our bedroom.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.335
That's crazy, right?

11:50.418 --> 11:52.587
I'm guessing you haven't told Sol.

11:52.670 --> 11:56.132
Oh, God, no. He'd want to talk about it
for days and days and days.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.550
So why are you telling me?

11:57.634 --> 11:59.761
Because you'll be leaving here in an hour.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.221
But why are you really telling me?

12:04.849 --> 12:08.186
Listen, nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.147
And you were a priest.
I don't know whether I need absolution

12:11.230 --> 12:13.691
or if I should check myself
into a psych ward.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.444
I'm sure whatever's going on with you
can be explained.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.404
How about them Chargers?!

12:19.656 --> 12:22.408
Every time I come out here you're huddled
in some secret conversation!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.995
What the hell is going on between you two?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.501
This quiche better be good.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.758
Oh!

12:38.841 --> 12:39.676
Oh, man!

12:39.759 --> 12:43.596
Oh, honey, why don't you
crawl over here and forage with me?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.266
We're floor people now.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.602
Look, I found some peppermints
and two pennies.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.772
You can put them
on top of my eyelids when I die.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.317
The peppermints.
And by the way, if I go first,

12:56.901 --> 12:58.695
you have permission to eat me.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.279
But not my face.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.741
I don't understand
why you're being so negative.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.744
You know how important
meeting Marla is for us.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.205
You're supposed to be my partner!

13:09.288 --> 13:11.290
I am being your partner.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.376
You're living in a dreamscape, Grace.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962
Even if you get to the phone,

13:16.045 --> 13:20.258
it's too late to get someone over here
to help us in time for the meeting.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.427
I will not give up.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.221
Fine! Then I will do it for you.

13:25.847 --> 13:26.806
Ah!

13:29.434 --> 13:30.852
What are you doing?

13:31.477 --> 13:34.147
I'm cancelling the meeting.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.899
-You wouldn't dare!
-Oh, wouldn't I?

13:37.984 --> 13:41.154
-You don't know Marla's number.
-Oh, don't I?

13:41.237 --> 13:44.699
Or did I write it
and the address of her office

13:44.782 --> 13:49.454
on my forearm because you always say
I'm so sucky with navigation?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.040
Ha!

13:52.123 --> 13:55.501
Beep, beep! Eat my floor dust!

13:56.753 --> 13:57.712
Ah!

14:01.049 --> 14:03.676
Don't you dare
cancel that meeting, Frankie.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.931
Well, this is
very<i> Making A Murderer,</i> isn't it?

14:09.223 --> 14:12.685
- A boat!
- Hey, howdy, folks.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.812
Come on in. Have a look-see.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.107
Don't worry, I chained that dog up.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.486
Albert "the Duke" Dukmejian.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.779
-All right. Coyote.
-Coyote.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.489
-Mallory.
-Hello, Mallory.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.948
-And Brianna.
-Hi, Bree.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.617
-Brianna.
-Brianna.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.952
Well, feel free to look around, folks.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.749
Everything here is for sale,
including this jacket.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.709
I am digging that jacket.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.628
I knew we were too far off the freeway.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.130
Can we please get the hell out of here?
I smell meth.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.424
We drove all the way here.
Let's at least look around.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.301
-Okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.055
I think I might have partied in this.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.515
Oh, Jesus.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.809
Do you want to live in this food truck?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.519
Well...

14:56.312 --> 14:58.189
it does have a big kitchen.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.025
-Oh, my God, you guys!
-Run! It's too late for Mallory!

15:01.859 --> 15:04.237
No, come here. This is awesome.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.531
Scared the shit out of me.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.410
Look!

15:11.786 --> 15:13.871
Oh, dear Lord, it's a tiny house.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.706
Is this for little people?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.418
No! Don't you ever watch
<i>Tiny House Hunters?</i>

15:18.501 --> 15:20.294
You know how I feel about tiny houses.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.380
What do you have against tiny houses?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.173
What don't I have against tiny houses?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.050
Look, I'm all for sustainable living,

15:26.134 --> 15:30.430
I don't need some smug,
whimsy-loving tiny-house fascist

15:30.513 --> 15:33.516
making me feel guilty
because I don't care to sleep sitting up!

15:33.599 --> 15:34.934
-That's harsh.
-Oh, is it?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.437
Or is "harsh" cooking brussels sprouts
on your stove-top

15:37.520 --> 15:40.356
and then hot-boxing yourself to death
with your own farts?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.109
Know what show I wanna watch?
<i>Tiny House Hunters Hunters!</i>

15:43.693 --> 15:45.361
I love this tiny porch.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.781
And it's going to make it look
like I've got a lot of stuff.

15:48.865 --> 15:49.949
Yeah.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.326
Hey, Duke, is this for sale?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.745
Everything's for sale!

15:55.788 --> 15:57.165
I'm never coming over.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.714
-I'm getting to that phone first.
-No.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.383
-No, you can't.
-What do you mean, "no"? Yes!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.177
Listen to your limits.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.220
I'm not gonna give up.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.472
Let go of me.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.767
-We're gonna do this.
-That's your hat, joke's on you!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.104
Grace, no.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.231
Ah! Aah!

16:36.412 --> 16:38.831
The only lunatic at this table is me, Sol.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.877
When you saw your mother,
was she... in bed with us?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.086
Oh, God, no.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.382
But, like,
my face wasn't her face, was it?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.468
No, but thanks
for putting that in my head.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.845
You know, in answer
to your question from before,

16:52.929 --> 16:55.765
I've heard lots of stories like that
in the confessional.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.308
It's not all that uncommon.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.768
See that?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.811
Of course you conjured your mother.

17:00.895 --> 17:04.106
That was a very hard visit
you had with her,

17:04.190 --> 17:08.027
so it makes perfect sense
that it rattled you.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.863
He came out to his mother.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.535
I think you buried the lead here.
She's still alive?

17:15.618 --> 17:17.370
You can't kill what's already dead.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.081
What was that like? How did it go?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.708
Well, I've had better times with the IRS.

17:24.293 --> 17:28.214
Will you walk me through
what happened last night?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.008
When you saw her
did she say anything?

17:31.092 --> 17:34.262
She didn't have to. I knew she was
thinking, "See you in hell, Bobby."

17:34.345 --> 17:36.597
She really thinks you're going to hell?

17:36.681 --> 17:39.267
Mother was a big believer
in the fire and brimstone.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.269
What about you?
Do you think you're going to hell?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.271
Of course he doesn't.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.148
Robert?

17:49.485 --> 17:54.657
I think some of the teachings
of the church cast very long shadows.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.659
Right, but you don't actually believe in

17:56.742 --> 17:59.203
an omnipotent God
who can send you to hell?

17:59.287 --> 18:00.371
I don't know.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.499
Do you really believe
God's angry when you eat lobster?

18:03.583 --> 18:09.255
Yes, I do. But God isn't sending me
to burn for all of eternity.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.049
Well, then I guess
it's a question of degrees, Sol.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.301
I agree.

18:13.467 --> 18:18.431
I've always thought religion is most
beneficial when it's taken à la carte.

18:18.514 --> 18:23.269
Look, I know that hell
isn't really a place.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.813
But I don't know that, too.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.526
There is this part of me, somewhere,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.988
that believes hell
is exactly where I'm going.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.407
But, if we're true to ourselves...

18:37.283 --> 18:40.036
and love each other the way we do...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.788
how can we be sinners?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.751
I struggled with this too.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.338
But a very wise priest gave me
another way to look at it.

18:51.088 --> 18:56.135
The afterlife is how
you're remembered by the living.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.972
Hitler was evil.
He will always be remembered as evil.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.932
He's in hell.

19:02.266 --> 19:06.062
Mother Teresa is holy and good.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.231
She will always be remembered for that.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.026
That's heaven.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.571
Oh, my God.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.159
Oh, my God.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.205
That's a really beautiful way
to look at it.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.626
That really shakes everything up.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.547
- You're welcome?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.801
Oh, my sweet<i> goyishe</i> boy.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.641
You two have nothing to worry about.
You'll both be remembered well.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.477
Who doesn't love divorce lawyers?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.647
Uh-oh.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.732
Okay.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.111
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.071
What's happening?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.280
I got a place.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.366
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.284
Where?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.328
I bought a house, man.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.247
-With... money?
-Yeah.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.082
It's the coolest thing.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.960
I found a tiny house.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.129
-Like the ones Brianna hates? Ah!
-Yeah!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.797
So this scores on a lot of levels.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.216
So, uh, when do you leave?

20:17.299 --> 20:20.052
Well... right now.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.055
Like now-now?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.766
Yeah, you wanted me out. I'm out.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.604
Okay. I know, but, you know,
I just, uh... got us a pizza.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.731
Oh.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.817
Yeah. Well, I could stay
for one last meal.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.364
What's the matter?

20:41.741 --> 20:42.700
I don't know.

20:43.159 --> 20:46.829
It's just fast and I thought, um...

20:46.912 --> 20:49.707
Dude. Are you gonna miss me?

20:52.334 --> 20:53.461
Yeah.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.838
Yeah. I think I am.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.299
Well, you know,
I just gave the down payment.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.135
-I could go back--
-No! No! No, no, no.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.929
Pizza and then I will help you
move this stuff out of here.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.725
Can you even fit
a full-size pizza in that house?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.393
-No. Personal pan only.
-Oh.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.065
Thanks for having me over for dessert.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.111
Thanks for everything you've done for me.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.322
Seriously.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.700
-I mean, since we were kids.
-Ah!

21:25.618 --> 21:26.827
You're my brother.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.746
I'm glad Mom bought you.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.582
I'm glad Mom bought you, too.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.294
Where did you get that killer jacket?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.671
Duke gave me a really good deal on it.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.799
It's nice, right?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.384
I think I owe him a couple of back rubs.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.641
I am the winner!

21:48.724 --> 21:50.935
Oh, you don't look like the winner.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.020
More like Mother Time's mother.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.191
You're right.

21:57.274 --> 22:01.237
What is the matter with me?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.322
Aah!

22:04.114 --> 22:08.077
How can I run a business
when I can't even get off the floor?

22:09.495 --> 22:10.746
My daughters are right.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.123
I can't do this.

22:15.835 --> 22:16.794
I'm old!

22:18.128 --> 22:20.506
Before, when I was young...

22:21.507 --> 22:23.592
there was this big oak tree
in the backyard.

22:24.510 --> 22:29.056
I could shoot up that sucker
faster than any boy in the neighborhood.

22:30.849 --> 22:35.646
The best part was getting to the tippy-top
and looking down at the world.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.231
You do love that.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.819
When I was up there,
I thought I could do anything.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.240
See, inside,
I still feel like that little girl...

22:47.449 --> 22:50.202
but I know I'm just fooling myself.

22:50.703 --> 22:55.082
Every day my body
tries to tell me how old I am...

22:56.584 --> 22:59.086
but today is the first day I hear it.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.089
It sure is a hard thing to hear.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.510
I got a new bike on my ninth birthday.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.097
I remember swerving
through the marching band...

23:10.848 --> 23:14.685
at the Fourth of July parade.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.646
Oh, they were so mad.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.315
So you know what I mean.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.358
I do.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.488
- And that little girl is not gone.
- Don't even try.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.615
Okay, I won't.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.118
But I still see her in you...

23:33.412 --> 23:36.624
when you're giving me shit
about being a sucky navigator...

23:37.374 --> 23:41.045
or you're chucking towels and hats at me.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.630
Really?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.757
You're still climbing trees.

23:45.883 --> 23:49.303
Only now they're banks and incubators.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.725
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't
think you could get us to the tippy-top.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.646
Thank you, Frankie.

23:59.938 --> 24:00.773
Thank you.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.650
Give me the phone.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.194
You calling Marla?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.614
Nope. I just thought
of who could help us make our meeting.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.704
Okay, I'm afraid I have a little
pinched nerve in my right shoulder,

24:15.788 --> 24:17.331
so I'll have to use my left side.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.501
Perfect. I've got sciatica
on my left side, so my right is better.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.960
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

24:22.044 --> 24:25.756
Now, remember, to lift with your legs,
not with your back.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.424
And bend your knees like so.

24:27.508 --> 24:30.260
-Knees are shot, I'll leverage my ankles.
-That's not gonna work.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.597
Will one of you geezers
help me up off this flipping floor?

24:33.681 --> 24:36.266
Here we go. One, two, three.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.064
-Are you okay?
-Not even close.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.149
-But I am up.
-Hello?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.151
Other ex-wife down over here.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.699
-Grace, I have to ask you something--
-I don't think it's a disc.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.368
-It's something muscular.
-Oh, good, good.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.914
Listen, I know I wasn't in any way
your dream husband or even a good one.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.999
-What?
-But, listen to me. Please.

25:01.083 --> 25:05.087
I just really hope that someday,
maybe after I'm gone,

25:05.170 --> 25:06.588
you'll remember me well.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.593
I know I'll always remember you picking me
up off the floor. If that ever happens.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.971
Here. Here we go.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.056
Up. Upsy-daisy.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.059
Yes!

25:22.730 --> 25:24.523
Now, raise your hand
if you're good with lipstick.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.239
Thank you so much, Marla,
for accommodating us.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.575
<i>Of course. Is everything all right?</i>

25:34.658 --> 25:38.537
Oh, sure! It's just we've been
running around today

25:38.620 --> 25:41.540
because we overscheduled ourselves.

25:41.623 --> 25:45.544
Plus, we wanted you to see
our headquarters and our wonderful wares.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.803
<i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>I can't wait to hear your story.</i>

25:54.887 --> 25:56.597
<i>You guys are really impressive.</i>

25:56.680 --> 25:57.806
Of course we are!

25:57.890 --> 25:59.475
We're Vybrant!

26:00.893 --> 26:02.352
-Is it too hot?
-Shh.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.945
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
