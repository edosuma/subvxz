00:05.922 --> 00:07.172
-Who are you?
-Castiel.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.508
I'm an angel of the Lord.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.678
The symbol you saw is called
the rising of the witnesses.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.888
It figures into an ancient prophecy.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.599
-What book is that prophecy from?
-Revelations.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.810
This is a sign, boys.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.438
SAM: A sign of what?
-The Apocalypse.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.899
Those seals are
being broken by Lilith.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.235
I don't think I like you anymore.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.821
You think of the seals
as locks on a door.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.116
-Okay, last one opens and....
-Lucifer walks free.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.243
Tell me about the months
without brother.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.580
About all the things you and
this demon bitch do in the dark.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.084
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

00:44.252 --> 00:47.171
How far from normal, from human?

00:48.006 --> 00:51.425
Cas said that if I don't stop you, he will.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.388
CASTIEL: The raising of Samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

00:56.556 --> 01:00.184
Breaking of the seal must be
prevented at all costs.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.438
URIEL: You were told not
to use your abilities.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.903
-What was I supposed to do?
-The only reason you're still alive...

01:11.071 --> 01:12.821
...is because you've been useful.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.616
The second you become
more trouble than you're worth...

01:15.784 --> 01:17.367
...then I will turn you to dust.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.328
As for your brother, tell him that...

01:19.496 --> 01:22.081
...maybe he should climb off
that high horse of his.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.542
Ask Dean what he remembers
from hell.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.062
WOMAN:
Anna?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.898
Do you know where you are?

01:49.567 --> 01:53.570
You're at the Connor Beverly
Behavioral Medicine Center.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.031
Do you know why you're here?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.953
Do you remember what you did?

02:02.914 --> 02:05.082
You were hysterical.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.627
It took four people to restrain you.

02:09.753 --> 02:12.548
I was trying to warn them.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.092
WOMAN:
Warn who?

02:15.468 --> 02:17.302
Everyone.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.347
Forget it.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.891
It was stupid.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.228
What were you trying
to warn them about?

02:30.316 --> 02:31.817
Look.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.279
I get it. You think I'm nuts.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.867
If I were you, I'd think I was nuts.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.703
But it's all true.

02:43.580 --> 02:48.083
It's okay. You can tell me.
I'm here to listen.

02:51.045 --> 02:55.090
The end is coming.

02:56.259 --> 03:01.138
-The Apocalypse.
-The Apocalypse, like in the Bible?

03:02.807 --> 03:06.810
Kind of. I mean, same bottom line.

03:08.938 --> 03:13.233
This demon, Lilith, is trying
to break the 66 seals...

03:13.401 --> 03:19.698
...to free Lucifer from hell.
Lucifer will bring the Apocalypse.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.660
So...

03:24.495 --> 03:26.747
...smoke them if you got them.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.760
Anna?

03:42.513 --> 03:44.264
Sorry.

03:44.807 --> 03:48.018
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.980
Just listening.

03:52.148 --> 03:57.152
So you were saying that there are
66 of these seals in the world?

03:57.320 --> 04:02.115
No. No. There are about
600 possible seals.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.868
And Lilith only has
to break 66 of them...

04:05.036 --> 04:08.080
...and no one knows
which 66 she's gonna break.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.289
I see.

04:12.460 --> 04:16.546
That's why it's nearly impossible
to stop her.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.926
And that's why
the angels are losing.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.431
That's why we're all gonna die.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.524
Time for your meds, Anna.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.737
Anna?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.035
What's the matter, sweetie?

04:47.203 --> 04:50.080
Your face. What happened
to your face?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.749
I know.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.836
I'm downright kissable.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.337
Shh.

05:31.247 --> 05:35.334
SAM: Come on, one more.
Just give me a chance to win it back.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.086
-It's your cash.
-Excuse me.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.505
My brother's a little sauced
to be making bets.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.466
Hey, he insisted.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.885
You've already taken, what,
two bills off him?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.471
-I'm just saying.
-Hey, shut up, Dean. I'm fine.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.848
No, you're not fine, you're drunk.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.518
-Let's make it 500.
-Five hundred?

05:54.437 --> 05:55.812
Sure.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.274
SAM: Five hundred.
-Your break.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.419
Keep the money.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.547
Keep the money?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.257
But....

06:30.390 --> 06:31.556
SAM:
Hey.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.975
Got a lot of nerve
showing up anywhere near me.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.229
-I just have some info and then I'm gone.
-What is it?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.730
I'm hearing a few whispers.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.525
Great. Demon whispers. That's reliable.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.403
A girl named Anna escaped
from a locked ward yesterday.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.905
The demons seem
pretty keen on finding her.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.658
Some heavy hitters turned out
for the Easter egg hunt.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.535
-Why? Who is she?
-No idea.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.703
But I'm thinking that she's important.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.164
Because the order's
to capture her alive.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.084
I just figured that
whatever the deal is...

06:59.252 --> 07:02.087
...you might wanna find this girl
before the demons do.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.841
Look, maybe we should check it out.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.553
-We're working a case, but thanks.
-What case?

07:09.720 --> 07:13.140
-We've got leads, big leads.
-Sounds dangerous.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.933
Ain't goose-chasing some chick...

07:15.101 --> 07:18.854
...who for all we know doesn't exist,
just because you say she's important.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.440
Just delivering the news.
Do what you want with it.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.234
Far as I'm concerned,
I told you, I'm done.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.736
Wait, this hospital Anna
escaped from.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.322
Got a name?

07:32.743 --> 07:35.537
Can I get a copy
of the Missing Persons report?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.498
Great. Okay. Thanks.

07:39.542 --> 07:43.712
-Well, Anna Milton's definitely real.
-Don't mean the case is real.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.924
-This hospital's a three-day drive.
-We've driven further for less, Dean.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.139
-You got something to say, say it.
-I'm saying it. This sucks.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.601
You're not pissed we're after the girl.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.936
-You're pissed Ruby threw us the tip.
-Right.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.481
Far as you're concerned,
the hell bitch is family.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.525
Something major must have
happened while I was downstairs...

08:05.693 --> 08:08.153
...because I come back
and you're BFF with a demon.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.447
I told you.
She helped me go after Lilith.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.116
Well, thanks for the thumbnail.
Real vivid.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.118
You wanna fill in a little detail?

08:15.286 --> 08:17.496
Sure, Dean, let's trade stories.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.998
You first. How was hell?
Don't spare the details.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.635
Come on!

09:13.803 --> 09:16.346
Where the hell are you?!

09:18.182 --> 09:20.267
MAN: I was wondering whether
to come or not.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.978
I mean, you shot one
of my coworkers.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.191
Don't take this
the wrong way, Sam...

09:28.359 --> 09:30.110
...but you don't look so hot, buddy.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.240
Guess burying your brother
didn't agree with you.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.165
Well?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.876
Let's see that special little knife
of yours first.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.011
No Devil's Traps either.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.848
I'm not here to play games.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.603
Well, let me guess.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.855
You wanna make a deal.

10:09.567 --> 10:14.195
And round and round
the Winchesters go.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.490
Sorry, Sam. That's not gonna happen.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.003
I don't want ten years.
I don't want one year.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.632
I don't want candy.
I want to trade places with Dean.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.216
No.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.802
Just take me! It's a fair trade!

10:37.970 --> 10:39.262
No.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.516
Why not?

10:43.768 --> 10:47.228
Lilith wants me dead.
Just let Dean go and she can have me.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.649
Don't you understand, Sam?
It's not about your soul.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.109
Dean's in hell,
right where we want him.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.279
We've got everything exactly
the way we want it.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.448
You wanna kill me, go ahead.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.825
I've made peace with my lord.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.471
WOMAN: Of course,
I wanna help however I can.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.224
SAM: The orderly has no recollection
of Anna's escape?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.434
Apparently, she knocked
him unconscious.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.144
The blow caused some amnesia.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.480
He doesn't even remember
coming into her room.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.733
Hell of a right hook to knock out
a guy with 80 pounds on her.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.985
We think she may have planned this.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.655
-Waited behind the door.
-Right.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.449
You mentioned
Anna's illness was recent.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.452
Two months ago
she was happy, well-adjusted.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.247
Journalism major,
lots of friends, bright future.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.416
So, what happened?
She just flipped?

11:50.292 --> 11:52.335
Well, that's the tragedy
of schizophrenia.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.963
Within weeks,
Anna was overtaken by delusions.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.549
What kind of delusions?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.634
She thought
demons were everywhere.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.387
Interesting.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.058
WOMAN: It's not uncommon for our
patients to believe that monsters are real.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.729
Well, that's just batty.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.537
It's Revelations.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.915
Since when does the Book of
Revelations have jack-o-lanterns?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.501
It's a little-known translation.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.589
Well, Anna's father
was a church deacon.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.384
When she became ill, her paranoia
took on religious overtones.

12:41.552 --> 12:46.473
She was convinced the devil was about
to rise up and end the world.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.433
I hope you find her.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.978
It's dangerous for her
to be out there alone right now.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.828
Maybe they're not home.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.288
Both cars in the driveway.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.345
Mr. and Mrs. Milton?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.890
SAM:
We're from the sheriff's department.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.727
Just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.415
[SNIFFS]

13:56.043 --> 13:57.836
Sulfur.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.755
Demons beat us here.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.507
Whatever the deal is with Anna--

14:02.675 --> 14:05.802
Yeah, they want her.
And they're not screwing around.

14:06.345 --> 14:11.391
All right, so, I'm Girl, Interrupted
and I know the score of the Apocalypse.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.226
Just busted out of the nut box.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.938
Possibly using superpowers,
by the way.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.440
Where do I go?

14:21.235 --> 14:23.611
Hey, you got those sketches
from Anna's notebook?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.780
-Yeah.
-Let me see them.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.325
Check this out.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.710
She was drawing the window
of her church, over and over.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.129
If you were religious, scared...

14:41.338 --> 14:44.757
...and had demons on your ass,
where would you go to feel safe?

15:14.663 --> 15:16.331
Dean.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.422
Anna?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.801
We're not gonna hurt you.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.136
We're here to help.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.599
My name is Sam.
This is my brother, Dean.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.017
ANNA:
Sam?

15:36.685 --> 15:38.686
Not Sam Winchester?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.190
Yeah.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.487
And you're Dean?

15:49.531 --> 15:50.698
The Dean?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.118
Well, yeah.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.704
The Dean, I guess.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.539
It's really you.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.709
Oh, my God.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.461
The angels talk about you.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.881
You were in hell,
but Castiel pulled you out...

16:07.049 --> 16:09.384
...and some of them
think you can help save us.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.888
And some of them
don't like you at all.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.307
They talk about you
all the time lately.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.393
I feel like I know you.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.728
So you talk to angels?

16:21.438 --> 16:23.356
Oh, no, no. No way.

16:23.524 --> 16:27.902
They probably don't even know I exist.
I just kind of overhear them.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.153
You overhear them?

16:29.321 --> 16:33.366
Yeah, they talk
and sometimes I just...

16:33.534 --> 16:35.368
...hear them in my head.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.496
Like right now?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.540
Not right this second. But a lot.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.543
And I can't shut them out.
There are so many of them.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.546
They lock you up with
a case of the crazies...

16:46.714 --> 16:50.508
...when really you were
just tuning in to angel radio?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.012
Yes.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.596
Thank you.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.599
Anna, when did the voices start?
Do you remember?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.436

37:41.676 --> 37:43.843
WOMAN:
Sir, I've got clean towels.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.682
Couldn't you just leave them
at the door?

37:54.605 --> 37:56.690
I'm at this address.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.483
I'm sorry, what?

37:59.193 --> 38:01.194
Go now.
Go through the bathroom window.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.197
Don't stop, don't take your car,
don't pass Go.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.700
There are demons in the hallway
and parking lot.

38:06.867 --> 38:07.867
Ruby?

38:08.077 --> 38:11.037
Okay, yeah, I'm possessing this maid
for a hot minute. Sue me.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.539
-What about--?
-Coma girl?

38:12.707 --> 38:14.958
Rotting on the floor
at the cabin with Anna.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.169
So I've gotta hurry back.
See you when you get there.

38:18.337 --> 38:20.005
Go!

38:36.897 --> 38:38.857
RUBY: Glad you could make it.
SAM: Yeah, thanks.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.859
Anna, are you okay?

38:41.027 --> 38:42.902
Yeah, I think so.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.239
Ruby's not like other demons.
She saved my life.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.909
I hear she does that.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.371
I guess I....

38:55.875 --> 38:58.168
-You know.
-What?

38:59.879 --> 39:02.630
I guess I owe you for Sam.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.592
And I just wanna....

39:05.760 --> 39:06.926
You know?

39:08.429 --> 39:11.348
-Don't strain yourself.
-Okay, then. Is the moment over?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.100
Good, because that was awkward.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.395
Hey, Sam? You think it'd be safe
to make a quick call?

39:17.563 --> 39:20.940
Just to tell my parents I'm okay?
They must be completely freaked.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.153
SAM:
Um....

39:26.155 --> 39:27.739
What?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.745
Anna.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.711
-Your parents.
-What about them?

39:43.089 --> 39:45.382
-I'm sorry.
-No, they're not--

39:45.591 --> 39:47.175
Anna, I'm sorry.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.303
[CRYING]

39:54.809 --> 39:58.686
-Why is this happening to me?
-I don't know.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.904
They're coming.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.203
-Back room.
-Come on.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.841
Where's the knife?

40:30.511 --> 40:32.178
-About that--
-You're kidding.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.347
Hey, don't look at me.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.474
Thanks a lot.

40:37.726 --> 40:41.813
Great. Just peachy.
Impeccable timing, guys, really.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.386
DEAN:
Please tell me you're here to help.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.472
We've been having
demon issues all day.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.764
I can see that.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.435
You want to explain why you have
that stain in the room?

41:23.564 --> 41:24.814
CASTIEL:
We're here for Anna.

41:27.735 --> 41:31.112
-Here for her like "here for her"?
-Stop talking.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.407
Give her to us.

41:36.368 --> 41:39.204
-Are you gonna help her?
-No.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.374
She has to die.
