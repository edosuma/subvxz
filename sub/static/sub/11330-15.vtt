00:00.158 --> 00:03.215
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.215 --> 00:04.153
Hi, Ben.

00:04.258 --> 00:05.536
What are you doing tonight?

00:05.633 --> 00:07.534
I don't think that we
should get back together.

00:08.691 --> 00:09.917
I'm looking for Omar.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.484
I blocked your calls.

00:11.644 --> 00:12.848
Your mom let me in.

00:12.849 --> 00:15.714
Well, my mom doesn't know that
you slept with my boyfriend.

00:16.888 --> 00:19.017
I kind of maybe still love Jack.

00:19.017 --> 00:20.002
I slept with Henry.

00:20.003 --> 00:21.415
I'm ashamed of myself.

00:21.415 --> 00:23.335
Don't ever come over to this house again!

00:23.336 --> 00:24.606
Ricky proposed to me.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.411
He called me up on the stage

00:25.412 --> 00:27.476
and he proposed to me in front of everyone.

00:27.476 --> 00:28.673
How embarrassing.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.465
Do you mind if we smoke?

00:30.765 --> 00:31.747
You smoke pot?

00:31.748 --> 00:32.755
What's that?

00:33.029 --> 00:35.104
You gave me a reason to
never trust you again.

00:35.104 --> 00:36.427
I went out with your brother
while you were gone,

00:36.428 --> 00:38.601
but now he hates me but
I still care about him.

00:39.643 --> 00:42.805
What if you go to summer school with me?

00:43.019 --> 00:44.362
Why would I go to summer school?

00:44.363 --> 00:47.090
There's nothing wrong with
her going to summer school.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.084
Mom, she's just going to summer
school 'cause Lauren is going.

00:50.085 --> 00:52.916
It doesn't matter why I'm going.
It would be good for me.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.540
Do I smell pot?

00:55.540 --> 00:56.781
Uh...

00:57.251 --> 01:00.343
My, uh... My fault.

01:01.063 --> 01:02.814
Why? Why are you doing this?

01:02.814 --> 01:04.800
Why are you insisting on
going to summer school?

01:04.801 --> 01:06.583
You don't need to go to summer school.

01:06.585 --> 01:07.810
Other than to get into the middle

01:07.811 --> 01:09.393
of this argument with Madison and Lauren,

01:09.394 --> 01:10.957
there's really no reason to go.

01:10.957 --> 01:12.493
Ricky, that has nothing to do with it.

01:12.494 --> 01:14.449
I just want to go to summer school.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.293
Your mother wants me to go so I'll
be there when Ethan is there.

01:16.294 --> 01:18.154
Why do you even care if
I go to summer school?

01:18.155 --> 01:19.936
Because you always work in the summer

01:19.937 --> 01:22.204
and working at the nursery
gives you all day with John

01:22.205 --> 01:25.061
and you earn a little money
and every little bit helps.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.666
Isn't it better to earn a little money

01:26.667 --> 01:28.703
and have some extra time with John?

01:28.780 --> 01:31.181
Yeah. I would like to spend
all day with John, but...

01:31.182 --> 01:31.945
But what?

01:31.946 --> 01:33.880
But I would rather go to summer school

01:33.881 --> 01:36.791
than have the money or the extra
time with John this summer.

01:37.753 --> 01:40.040
And besides, if I can
knock out a few courses,

01:40.041 --> 01:42.493
then it'll make our lives
easier all next year.

01:42.494 --> 01:43.627
How? How?

01:43.627 --> 01:46.076
Ricky, you're going to be in college.
You're going to be busier.

01:46.077 --> 01:47.078
I'll need to pick up the slack.

01:47.079 --> 01:49.375
What slack?
There's not going to be any slack.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.820
With you in college?

01:51.614 --> 01:54.680
Ricky, come on, there's
going to be some slack.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.674
You're going to have to study more,

01:56.832 --> 01:57.688
you're going to have to spend more time

01:57.689 --> 01:59.399
going to and from school...

01:59.400 --> 02:02.718
You're going to be busy, really busy.

02:02.718 --> 02:04.109
And if I'm less busy with school,

02:04.110 --> 02:05.198
then I will have more time

02:05.199 --> 02:07.383
to do all the things I'm
going to have to do

02:07.383 --> 02:10.261
that you used to do for me or with me.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.065
Like cleaning the apartment

02:13.065 --> 02:15.998
and doing laundry and cooking.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.827
I'm going to have to cook more.

02:18.297 --> 02:20.379
Are there going to be cooking
classes in summer school?

02:20.380 --> 02:21.390
I can cook.

02:21.524 --> 02:23.448
You don't have to cook, I'll cook.

02:23.448 --> 02:24.531
I'll cook.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.685
I know you think I can't
cook, but I can cook.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.014
Besides, maybe it would be
healthier if we ate raw foods.

02:31.015 --> 02:33.846
Raw foods, huh? You want to eat raw meat?

02:33.846 --> 02:35.612
Because we get free meat from downstairs

02:35.613 --> 02:37.784
and that saves us a lot
of money on groceries.

02:37.784 --> 02:39.757
Yeah, well, we can't just
eat meat all the time.

02:39.758 --> 02:42.130
We can if we want. I don't want.

02:42.130 --> 02:44.595
Okay, well you figure out how
we can pay for the groceries

02:44.596 --> 02:46.036
since you're not working this summer.

02:46.037 --> 02:47.218
It's not like you were counting on that

02:47.219 --> 02:49.971
little bit of money I'd be
bringing in this summer.

02:51.434 --> 02:52.325
Were you?

02:52.928 --> 02:54.588
We're on a really tight budget here,

02:54.589 --> 02:55.992
and now that we're engaged,

02:55.993 --> 02:58.737
then I think you should stop taking
any money from your parents.

02:58.737 --> 02:59.614
But they're supposed to take care of me

02:59.615 --> 03:01.090
until I graduate high school.

03:01.091 --> 03:02.895
You're not living at home anymore.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.389
We're a family now,

03:04.390 --> 03:05.895
even though we're young and
we're not married yet,

03:05.896 --> 03:09.489
we're a family, so let's
sit down and do a budget

03:09.489 --> 03:10.685
and just look at what we have

03:10.686 --> 03:13.264
before you make your final
decision about summer school.

03:13.264 --> 03:14.741
I'm going to summer school.

03:15.157 --> 03:15.942
Then go.

03:15.943 --> 03:17.739
I'm going to go, I said I was going to,

03:17.740 --> 03:19.632
I don't even know why
we're arguing about this.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.701
We're not arguing, we're just
figuring out the money situation,

03:22.701 --> 03:25.229
like couples do when they're responsible.

03:25.894 --> 03:26.800
Whatever.

03:30.564 --> 03:32.332
It's my last summer before senior year

03:32.333 --> 03:34.023
and I want to do what I want to do!

03:34.024 --> 03:34.873
All right.

03:34.874 --> 03:37.315
You're not my parent, you know. I know.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.037 --> 03:51.517
Did you forget we don't sleep in there?

03:51.518 --> 03:52.880
I might be sleeping in there

03:52.881 --> 03:55.316
if I don't like living
on your stupid budget.

03:55.316 --> 03:58.868
It's not my stupid budget, it's
going to be our stupid budget.

04:00.011 --> 04:02.249
I'm sure we can figure out
how to live on what we have

04:02.250 --> 04:04.516
with you in summer school,
and if we can't...

04:04.516 --> 04:07.180
If we can't, I'm still
going to summer school.

04:29.131 --> 04:30.440
Good morning!

04:30.440 --> 04:34.932
Oh, geez, Grace, something, or someone.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.258
What are you doing here?
The key was under the mat.

04:37.259 --> 04:40.497
Oh. Yeah. Remember to move that.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.652
What are you doing here?

04:42.653 --> 04:43.708
What am I doing here?

04:43.709 --> 04:45.759
I am making you breakfast

04:45.759 --> 04:47.406
before we head off at summer school,

04:47.407 --> 04:48.931
that is what I'm doing here.

04:51.195 --> 04:52.859
Um, I see suitcases.

04:52.859 --> 04:56.894
Yes, you do. Because I'm moving in!

04:57.863 --> 05:00.060
I thought your mom said
you couldn't move in.

05:00.061 --> 05:02.522
Yes. She did. To go to med camp.

05:02.522 --> 05:04.159
I couldn't go to summer school.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.569
But I thought I'm almost an adult

05:07.569 --> 05:09.020
and I can make my own decisions.

05:09.403 --> 05:11.023
And how's she going to find out about it?

05:11.024 --> 05:12.090
She left for Africa this morning.

05:12.091 --> 05:13.259
What happens when she calls?

05:13.260 --> 05:16.201
I answer my phone. Where my phone is.

05:16.201 --> 05:17.447
You would actually lie to your mother?

05:17.448 --> 05:18.780
She put me in that position.

05:18.781 --> 05:20.939
I have no choice, I have to lie.

05:21.290 --> 05:22.632
But it's just for a few weeks,

05:22.633 --> 05:24.662
and by the time she gets back she'll see

05:24.663 --> 05:27.369
that I was serious about no boys
and focusing on my school work

05:27.369 --> 05:29.630
and getting the best possible
grades I can in senior year.

05:29.631 --> 05:31.799
I think she'll be fine with it.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.352
And if she's not?

05:33.661 --> 05:34.611
Then she's not.

05:34.832 --> 05:35.733
I don't know, Grace,

05:35.734 --> 05:37.939
I'd love to have you live here, but...

05:37.939 --> 05:38.995
No buts.

05:39.248 --> 05:41.510
This is going to be a fun summer,

05:41.510 --> 05:45.483
a girlfriend summer, just the
two of us and our books.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.039
Okay, I'm going to put my things away.

06:01.898 --> 06:02.814
What do you mean?

06:02.815 --> 06:05.676
I mean she's not here.
And she didn't answer.

06:05.758 --> 06:08.036
Maybe she thought I don't know. Her up,

06:08.037 --> 06:10.302
I checked in last night late this morning.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.062
Oh. Well, maybe that's it.
Maybe she's just late.

06:13.063 --> 06:16.390
She wanted to she insisted on it.

06:16.391 --> 06:18.366
She's probably caught in traffic.

06:18.366 --> 06:19.602
You're sure to be here?

06:19.603 --> 06:21.331
Yes, I'm sure.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.655
She had this crazy plan
and live with Adrian,

06:24.656 --> 06:26.462
but I talked her out of it.

06:26.463 --> 06:28.618
You sure you talked her out of it?
I'm sure.

06:28.619 --> 06:31.092
I hope so, going to be here.

06:31.093 --> 06:34.199
Where else would she be?
I want her to be at med camp,

06:34.199 --> 06:36.785
so I'm sure she'll be at med camp.

06:37.244 --> 06:39.102
I mean, sometimes she
doesn't like what I say,

06:39.103 --> 06:40.864
but she does respect me

06:41.130 --> 06:43.181
and she does usually do
what I want her to do.

06:43.182 --> 06:45.084
She's basically a good girl.

06:45.084 --> 06:48.847
And she loves me, to med camp, she's going

06:48.900 --> 06:50.282
even if you're there.

06:53.328 --> 06:56.649
Wait. Oh, dear.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.666
I think my head is feeling
a little wombley.

07:00.666 --> 07:01.866
Did you take something for the flight?

07:01.867 --> 07:04.995
Yes, but don't worry, it's prescription.

07:04.995 --> 07:06.100
Your prescription? Yes.

07:06.101 --> 07:08.203
My doctor called in something for me.

07:08.204 --> 07:10.362
I get very anxious about flying

07:10.362 --> 07:13.155
ever since my husband was
killed in a plane crash.

07:15.694 --> 07:17.848
All right, well, I'm sure
the flight will be fine.

07:17.849 --> 07:20.153
And even if it's not, I will be.

07:22.122 --> 07:24.393
All right, well, enjoy.

07:24.752 --> 07:25.839
Bye, Doc.

07:26.262 --> 07:27.177
Bye.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.151
I think I'm going to like
having Grace live here.

07:30.724 --> 07:33.452
Oh, she didn't make those, her
mother probably made those.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.148
All she can make are cookies.

07:35.317 --> 07:36.248
By the way,

07:37.963 --> 07:39.666
Grace thinks we're not
seeing guys this summer.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.708
You and me?

07:40.719 --> 07:43.857
'Cause I wasn't planning on
seeing any guys this summer,

07:43.857 --> 07:45.137
or any other time.

07:45.138 --> 07:46.185
She and I.

07:46.659 --> 07:47.459
Why's that?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.536
Because we told her mother

07:49.537 --> 07:52.295
we wouldn't see guys this summer,
we would focus on school.

07:52.295 --> 07:53.717
You promised her mother that, too?

07:53.718 --> 07:55.982
Yes. But her mother said no.

07:55.983 --> 07:57.828
So... So you called me.

07:57.828 --> 07:59.063
Yeah, well, you would have called me.

07:59.064 --> 08:00.631
Maybe, maybe not.

08:00.632 --> 08:02.506
Definitely. Not definitely.

08:02.506 --> 08:03.414
I don't have time to argue.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.211
I have to finish getting
dressed and get out of here.

08:05.665 --> 08:08.009
All right, I know when I'm not wanted.

08:08.616 --> 08:09.600
I'll talk to you later.

08:09.601 --> 08:11.512
No, no, no, no, no!

08:11.855 --> 08:13.432
You're supposed to wait until I've left.

08:13.433 --> 08:14.817
Why? Because we're hiding

08:14.818 --> 08:16.292
that we're seeing each other from Grace?

08:16.293 --> 08:17.154
Yes.

08:17.401 --> 08:19.313
No, no, no. I don't play that.

08:19.313 --> 08:20.871
Not telling my brother I was seeing you

08:20.872 --> 08:22.691
is the closest I've ever come to lying.

08:23.032 --> 08:25.452
So, see you.

08:31.017 --> 08:33.557
Bye, Adrian, bye, Grace!

08:40.744 --> 08:43.307
Am I crazy?
I thought I just heard a guy yell,

08:43.307 --> 08:45.333
"Bye, Adrian, bye, Grace"

08:45.493 --> 08:48.291
and then I ran out just in time
to see a guy going out the door.

08:49.105 --> 08:50.533
I saw Omar.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.994
Oh, come on. I did.

08:51.994 --> 08:55.440
No, you didn't. Probably like a...

08:55.861 --> 08:58.209
A mirage. Mmm-hmm.

08:58.404 --> 09:00.184
You know, we've been
without guys for a week,

09:00.185 --> 09:01.777
and you're starting to hear things

09:01.777 --> 09:04.001
and see things that aren't there.

09:04.613 --> 09:07.579
No, really, maybe you're just stressed,

09:07.579 --> 09:10.888
and, you know, just imagining things.

09:11.206 --> 09:14.042
I'm not stressed. Why would I be stressed?

09:14.170 --> 09:16.867
Because I lied to my mother
so I could live with you?

09:16.867 --> 09:18.577
Is it too late for you to go to med camp?

09:18.578 --> 09:20.725
Yes, it's too late for
me to go to med camp!

09:25.206 --> 09:26.646
No, I don't see her, she's not here.

09:26.647 --> 09:29.023
She's not here either, she's
about to miss the first class

09:29.024 --> 09:30.301
and that's against the rules.

09:30.302 --> 09:31.514
She's probably stuck on the freeway,

09:31.515 --> 09:33.178
she's the slowest driver in the world.

09:33.179 --> 09:35.823
Yeah, I know, but excuses
don't really fly here.

09:35.823 --> 09:37.940
I just hope she's okay. Yeah, me too.

09:38.189 --> 09:40.679
I'd hate to see her miss a
summer with you at med camp.

09:41.001 --> 09:42.089
I know you don't mean that.

09:42.090 --> 09:44.056
No, I do. Call me when she's there, buddy.

09:44.057 --> 09:44.997
All right.

10:01.075 --> 10:02.860
What are you doing, you pervert?

10:02.861 --> 10:04.532
Get off my sister's bed!

10:04.532 --> 10:06.849
I wasn't doing anything.
I was looking for Grace.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.466
Oh. Well, I came to tell you that

10:09.634 --> 10:12.268
Grace is looking for you.

10:12.474 --> 10:15.367
She's trying to call you.

10:15.367 --> 10:18.324
She said it's an emergency.

10:22.766 --> 10:24.009
Hello? If my mother calls looking for me,

10:24.010 --> 10:25.710
tell her I'm on my way to med camp.

10:25.711 --> 10:26.938
I'm late but I'm going to med camp,

10:26.939 --> 10:28.238
I'm definitely going to med camp

10:28.239 --> 10:30.944
and gonna personally beg
for them to let me in.

10:30.954 --> 10:32.988
I'm not at Adrian's and I'm
not going to summer school!

10:32.989 --> 10:34.670
I'm going to med camp, I swear.

10:41.005 --> 10:42.443
Oh. Hi, Kathleen.

10:42.444 --> 10:46.342
You're the only one of Grace's
friends that calls me Kathleen.

10:46.342 --> 10:49.141
I apologize. Is it Mrs. Tsegay then?

10:50.097 --> 10:51.249
We'll see, won't we?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.923
Uh, I don't know. Is everything okay?

10:53.924 --> 10:56.825
I'm at the airport, I'm
going to see my husband.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.766
Oh, then tell my dad I said hello.

10:58.766 --> 11:01.111
Oh, that's right! I forgot about that.

11:01.134 --> 11:02.847
I'm forgetting about everything.

11:04.465 --> 11:06.597
I can't remember why I called you.

11:06.803 --> 11:09.002
Are you calling about
Grace and me breaking up?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.956
Yeah. Maybe I am.

11:11.726 --> 11:13.023
Are you broken up?

11:13.364 --> 11:15.279
She's not over there, is she?
I'm wondering,

11:15.280 --> 11:17.834
because apparently, she's not at med camp.

11:18.314 --> 11:20.339
Hey, just got back from Adrian's.

11:20.569 --> 11:22.293
You didn't see Grace over there, did you?

11:22.478 --> 11:25.007
Yeah. I did. She's over at Adrian's.

11:27.258 --> 11:28.504
Grace's mom is looking for her.

11:28.505 --> 11:32.243
Oh! Ooh! Hang up. Hang up, man!
Hang up the phone!

11:43.291 --> 11:45.084
Get up, you're going to summer school.

11:45.084 --> 11:48.534
Summer school?
That's going to be my punishment now?

11:48.726 --> 11:50.161
That's not your punishment,
that's in addition

11:50.162 --> 11:52.507
to taking away your phone
and your computer.

11:52.515 --> 11:53.076
You're not going to see

11:53.077 --> 11:55.637
your phone or computer
for a long, long time.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.673
And I'm not done yet.

11:58.226 --> 12:00.444
You've been working on
this for a week, you know.

12:00.444 --> 12:01.812
Yeah, I know. And this morning,

12:01.813 --> 12:03.287
I came up with something else.

12:03.288 --> 12:04.391
Summer school.

12:04.733 --> 12:06.566
Dad, I don't need to go to summer school.

12:06.784 --> 12:09.260
I'm sure there's some other
punishment that would be

12:09.582 --> 12:11.576
more productive.

12:11.576 --> 12:13.911
Yeah, well, you don't get to decide that.
Get dressed.

12:13.912 --> 12:15.990
I don't want to go to summer school.

12:15.991 --> 12:18.829
It's a waste of time, and Henry
is going to summer school.

12:18.829 --> 12:21.078
Yeah, well, you're going to run
into Henry sooner or later

12:21.079 --> 12:23.369
and I don't care that Henry
is going to summer school.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.137
Why is Henry going to summer school?

12:26.138 --> 12:27.744
Because Madison is going to summer school.

12:27.745 --> 12:29.272
Why is Madison going to summer school?

12:29.273 --> 12:31.492
Because Madison slept
with Lauren's boyfriend.

12:31.492 --> 12:33.353
Same night Henry slept with Adrian.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.099
No one's speaking to Madison. Or Henry.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.670
So the two of them have apparently bonded.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.062
That's what I've heard, anyway.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.358
You're not supposed to hear anything.

12:41.359 --> 12:42.617
You don't have a phone or a computer.

12:42.618 --> 12:45.157
You're the one who let Alice come up here.
Alice told me.

12:45.157 --> 12:46.733
And Alice is never speaking to Henry again,

12:46.734 --> 12:48.066
and neither am I.

12:48.169 --> 12:49.748
And even if I run into
him at summer school,

12:49.749 --> 12:51.134
I'm not speaking to him.

12:51.278 --> 12:53.855
Just so you know, just in
case you're pretending

12:53.855 --> 12:55.031
you don't know he's going to be there

12:55.032 --> 12:56.576
and this is just your latest attempt

12:56.577 --> 12:58.275
to get the two of us together to talk.

12:58.276 --> 13:00.457
We haven't talked about
summer school, Henry and me.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.950
And who Adrian sleeps with
is none of your business,

13:02.958 --> 13:05.092
you two are soon to be
divorced and that's that.

13:05.092 --> 13:07.480
No, that's not that.
You're still paying for that condo

13:07.481 --> 13:08.852
and my ex-best friend is probably

13:08.853 --> 13:10.873
sleeping with my soon-to-be ex-wife in it.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.233
No, he's not. He might be.

13:12.234 --> 13:13.779
He's not. I talked to Henry.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.667
He knows he made a mistake, Ben.

13:15.668 --> 13:17.400
Uh, yeah, he made a mistake.

13:17.401 --> 13:20.329
People make mistakes. You make mistakes.

13:20.329 --> 13:22.455
You keep making mistakes.

13:22.850 --> 13:25.468
I know you're lying about
who gave you that pot.

13:25.575 --> 13:26.864
I take full responsibility.

13:26.865 --> 13:30.302
Why don't you not take full
responsibility for once? Huh?

13:30.400 --> 13:32.167
You always got to be the hero?

13:32.173 --> 13:35.128
Is that a bad quality?
Always being the hero?

13:35.129 --> 13:38.282
Let me put it another way.
You're always rescuing women.

13:38.282 --> 13:39.903
That's a bad quality.

13:40.589 --> 13:42.809
We've both done it and I thought
we'd both learned from it,

13:42.810 --> 13:44.970
but obviously you haven't learned a thing.

13:45.376 --> 13:48.256
Stop rescuing bad girls
from their bad habits

13:48.256 --> 13:50.712
before you get yourself
into some bad trouble.

13:52.110 --> 13:55.644
Oh, right, you're already
in some bad trouble.

13:55.645 --> 13:57.892
Get dressed. You're going to summer school.

13:57.893 --> 13:59.954
And take what? Whatever.

13:59.954 --> 14:01.090
You're not sleeping in all summer

14:01.091 --> 14:03.044
and hanging around here
in the butcher shop.

14:03.045 --> 14:06.365
You can work at the butcher shop
after school, same as always.

14:06.366 --> 14:09.628
Okay. If that's what you want
me to do, that's what I'll do.

14:09.628 --> 14:10.934
That's what I want you to do.

14:10.935 --> 14:14.638
How is doing what I was doing
before any kind of punishment?

14:14.639 --> 14:16.884
You're doing it without
a phone or computer.

14:16.884 --> 14:18.946
If I go to summer school, I'm
going to have to use a computer.

14:18.947 --> 14:21.937
In fact, if I go to summer school
I'll have access to a computer

14:21.937 --> 14:23.928
because they have computers in the library.

14:23.942 --> 14:25.799
Access this girl Dylan again

14:25.881 --> 14:28.344
and I'll access your ass, you got it?

14:28.929 --> 14:30.329
What does that mean?

14:31.112 --> 14:34.293
Are you threatening to spank me?

14:34.293 --> 14:37.202
Get up, get dressed, and go to school.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.077
You can't be so depressed
about this, honey,

14:43.078 --> 14:44.655
he's a three-time loser.

14:44.730 --> 14:47.773
He got a girl pregnant, now he's
divorced and he smokes pot!

14:47.773 --> 14:48.879
Big deal.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.810
It is a big deal!
It's illegal for one thing.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.955
And for another thing, it's
just not good for you.

14:54.165 --> 14:56.352
If nothing else, it makes
you make bad decisions.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.002
We just tried it.

14:58.003 --> 14:59.657
I believe you've tried it before.

14:59.658 --> 15:01.016
I never said I did.

15:01.016 --> 15:02.495
I'm pretty sure you did.

15:02.976 --> 15:06.121
Either way, it's not his
fault if I smoked pot.

15:06.121 --> 15:09.339
Oh, yes, it was his fault,
he gave it to you.

15:09.558 --> 15:11.267
And he looks like a drug addict.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.477
Is he doing cocaine, and
crack or something?

15:13.477 --> 15:16.710
No. He is not doing cocaine
and crack or something.

15:17.046 --> 15:20.167
Why would you think he's doing
cocaine and crack or something?

15:20.170 --> 15:22.484
Geez, Mom. Crack is cocaine.

15:22.485 --> 15:25.270
Well, excuse me for not knowing drug lingo.

15:25.270 --> 15:26.900
But I do know the signs of using drugs.

15:26.901 --> 15:28.090
And he's skinny as a rail.

15:28.091 --> 15:28.831
So what?

15:28.832 --> 15:31.167
His father owns a worldwide
sausage company.

15:31.167 --> 15:33.176
Don't you think he should have
some more meat on his bones?

15:33.177 --> 15:35.756
Maybe his weight hasn't
caught up with his height.

15:36.419 --> 15:39.698
Mom, I really really, really
want to go out with him again.

15:39.698 --> 15:41.311
And your father and I
really, really, really

15:41.312 --> 15:43.240
don't want you to go out with him again.

15:43.364 --> 15:44.294
Ever.

15:45.602 --> 15:47.930
Enough with the look, I
don't like the look.

15:47.931 --> 15:50.029
And I don't like Ben Boykewich.

15:50.029 --> 15:51.871
He's trouble, trouble with a capital T.

15:51.872 --> 15:53.757
Mom. Uh-uh.

15:53.757 --> 15:55.915
You go out there and you find
yourself another boyfriend,

15:55.916 --> 15:57.010
a nice boy,

15:57.038 --> 15:58.457
someone who doesn't do drugs,

15:58.458 --> 16:00.366
someone who doesn't even want to try drugs,

16:00.367 --> 16:03.496
someone who's never had sex
before or gotten a girl pregnant,

16:03.658 --> 16:05.467
someone who's never gotten a divorce.

16:05.515 --> 16:06.941
So I'm off restriction?

16:07.339 --> 16:09.897
No. I meant when you're off restriction.

16:09.898 --> 16:13.568
But it's summer! I want to go
out, I want to go out with Ben!

16:13.568 --> 16:15.340
You don't need to go out in summer,

16:15.341 --> 16:16.400
you'll get sunburned

16:16.401 --> 16:19.322
and skin cancer with your
fair beautiful skin.

16:19.322 --> 16:21.195
You can go out in the
fall when school starts.

16:21.196 --> 16:25.568
Mom, please, please, please,
I've been in all week.

16:25.956 --> 16:28.158
Maybe your father and I can think about it.

16:28.786 --> 16:30.699
Could I go out tonight?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.122
I can't get sunburned at night.

16:32.123 --> 16:34.405
No. You can't get sunburned at night,

16:34.405 --> 16:36.108
but you can get into trouble at night.

16:36.109 --> 16:38.588
Mom, you totally got the
wrong impression of Ben.

16:38.589 --> 16:41.880
He's a really nice guy
and I really like him.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.126
Like someone else.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.211
How am I going to meet someone else to like

16:45.211 --> 16:46.996
if I can't get out of the house?

16:47.931 --> 16:49.289
I'll talk to your father.

16:49.472 --> 16:51.102
Not about going out with Ben,

16:51.102 --> 16:52.771
just about going out of the house,

16:52.958 --> 16:55.976
but you'll have to promise me
you'll never go anywhere near Ben.

16:55.976 --> 16:57.890
Okay, I won't go anywhere near Ben.

16:58.548 --> 16:59.477
Thanks, Mom.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.072
I'm not promising anything.

17:01.073 --> 17:03.294
I know that. But thank you.

17:19.368 --> 17:20.390
Alice's phone.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.306
Hello, Alice's phone.

17:22.306 --> 17:23.575
Hey, how are you?

17:23.576 --> 17:24.914
I miss you!

17:25.071 --> 17:26.082
And I miss you!

17:26.083 --> 17:28.694
But I'm going to have to give
Alice her phone back today,

17:28.727 --> 17:29.466
I promised.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.161
Aw. Do you have to?

17:31.162 --> 17:33.626
Yeah. But maybe I can call you from work.

17:33.627 --> 17:36.366
I have to see you. I have good news.

17:36.366 --> 17:38.648
Your dad is going to let you see me? No.

17:38.841 --> 17:41.541
Yeah, my parents aren't going
to let me see you either.

17:42.431 --> 17:44.781
Another thing we have in common.

17:45.421 --> 17:48.024
My dad said that he's gonna
send me to summer school

17:48.025 --> 17:49.805
as part of my punishment.

17:49.805 --> 17:51.555
And?

17:51.736 --> 17:54.118
And who's going to know if
I'm in summer school or not?

18:13.151 --> 18:14.636
Why didn't she drop you off at school?

18:14.637 --> 18:17.248
'Cause you know, I'm scared.

18:17.249 --> 18:19.165
No, you're not. No, I kind of am.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.085
Scared of what?

18:20.086 --> 18:22.494
Scared of screwing up
and getting sent back.

18:22.494 --> 18:23.713
Then don't screw up.

18:23.714 --> 18:25.239
I'm not going to screw up on purpose.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.036
You're not going to screw
up accidentally either.

18:27.037 --> 18:28.762
I don't know what you're
in such a bad mood about.

18:28.763 --> 18:30.286
I'm in a bad mood because I don't think

18:30.287 --> 18:32.083
Amy should be going to summer school,

18:32.084 --> 18:33.908
but Mom is all happy about it

18:33.908 --> 18:35.508
because now Amy can be there for you

18:35.509 --> 18:36.051
and I don't even think

18:36.052 --> 18:37.953
she knows what being there for you entails.

18:37.954 --> 18:40.288
Yeah, that is really nice of Amy, isn't it?

18:40.288 --> 18:41.296
To be there for me.

18:41.297 --> 18:42.565
Yeah, it is, especially since

18:42.566 --> 18:45.652
Amy has other more important
things to do this summer.

18:45.653 --> 18:47.168
Like what? It's summer.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.928
This is when we work, this is not
when we go to school, usually.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.494
We're engaged, we have a kid,
we have other responsibilities.

18:53.577 --> 18:54.874
I can hear you.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.470
Other responsibilities?

18:57.680 --> 18:59.047
Aren't I your other responsibility?

18:59.048 --> 19:00.641
We are not going to be responsible for you,

19:00.642 --> 19:02.461
I am not going to be responsible for you,

19:02.462 --> 19:05.038
Amy is not going to be responsible for you.
You know why?

19:05.039 --> 19:07.642
Because you are going to
be responsible for you.

19:07.642 --> 19:09.807
And you are not going to screw up.

19:10.163 --> 19:11.243
Good morning, Ethan.

19:11.644 --> 19:12.861
Good morning, Amy.

19:12.862 --> 19:14.832
Thanks again for letting me
walk into school with you.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.149
It makes the first day of high school

19:16.150 --> 19:17.360
a little less awkward for me.

19:17.361 --> 19:19.903
Yeah. I remember my first
day of high school,

19:19.903 --> 19:21.185
how awkward it was.

19:22.898 --> 19:25.017
What? Oh, nothing.

19:25.151 --> 19:27.391
So you're going to go, even after
looking at all the numbers,

19:27.392 --> 19:28.153
you're going to go?

19:28.154 --> 19:30.480
Because you know, you could
just walk him in there

19:30.529 --> 19:31.877
and walk out and go to the nursery.

19:31.878 --> 19:34.276
I could, but again, I'm not going to

19:34.368 --> 19:36.753
and I could hear everything you
were saying in here, you know.

19:37.821 --> 19:39.996
This may not be when you
go to school, Mr. Perfect,

19:39.997 --> 19:41.838
but some people need to go
to school during the summer.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.641
Like Ethan. And like me.

19:44.927 --> 19:45.908
Let's go, Ethan.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.432
Yeah, Mr. Perfect.

19:48.435 --> 19:49.362
What are you doing?

19:49.452 --> 19:50.695
I don't know. What are you doing?

19:50.696 --> 19:51.984
I was giving Ethan a lecture

19:51.985 --> 19:54.246
and you're undermining my
authority by calling me names.

19:54.247 --> 19:55.923
You don't have any authority.

19:55.924 --> 19:58.059
No, you definitely don't
have any authority.

19:58.060 --> 20:01.698
Yeah, I do.
I'm an adult and you're not an adult.

20:01.698 --> 20:02.833
That doesn't mean you can lecture me.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.398
Yeah, it does. Whatever.

20:04.398 --> 20:06.331
We have to go.
You can lecture him when we get home.

20:06.332 --> 20:07.364
His home, not our home,

20:07.365 --> 20:09.275
he goes back to his home after school.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.998
Margaret said to just bring me back here

20:10.999 --> 20:12.391
since she's working this afternoon.

20:12.392 --> 20:14.496
I'm working this afternoon. And so is Amy.

20:14.497 --> 20:17.144
Yeah, Amy told her maybe I can
just do my homework up here

20:17.144 --> 20:18.674
until someone can pick me up.

20:20.025 --> 20:21.780
We have to go, we have to drop John off.

20:21.781 --> 20:23.637
I can take John.
And when were you going to tell me this?

20:23.638 --> 20:25.174
That you're dropping him off here?

20:25.174 --> 20:26.288
How am I going to keep an eye on him

20:26.289 --> 20:28.001
when I'm downstairs in the butcher shop?

20:28.002 --> 20:30.322
Uh, I don't know, but I'm
sure Ethan can stay up here

20:30.323 --> 20:32.514
all by himself without
getting into any trouble.

20:32.514 --> 20:33.319
Can't you, Ethan?

20:33.320 --> 20:35.365
I'm sure.
And thank you for your trust, Amy.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.460
You're welcome.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.472
Wait downstairs.

20:41.445 --> 20:42.592
You got the eye roll.

20:49.909 --> 20:51.467
What? What?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.510
What is going on?

20:52.511 --> 20:54.345
What is going on is that
just because we're engaged

20:54.346 --> 20:56.111
doesn't mean you're the boss of me.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.349
Or that kid out there.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.177
I know I'm not the boss of you,

20:59.177 --> 21:01.965
but I am the boss of him, and
you're the boss of him, too.

21:01.966 --> 21:04.092
No I'm not, I'm just his ride to school.

21:04.093 --> 21:05.704
No. No, you're not just his ride to school.

21:05.705 --> 21:06.922
Mom didn't ask you to give

21:06.923 --> 21:08.352
him a ride just so you'd give him a ride.

21:08.353 --> 21:09.438
She could give him a ride.

21:09.439 --> 21:11.724
No, you're the person looking
out after him at school

21:11.725 --> 21:13.023
and keeping him out of trouble.

21:13.024 --> 21:14.272
Oh, please. I am not.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.398
No, you are.
And you better take it seriously

21:16.399 --> 21:18.763
or you're going to end up getting blamed

21:18.764 --> 21:20.035
for any trouble that he gets into.

21:20.036 --> 21:21.135
How?

21:21.809 --> 21:24.722
Ricky, if he gets into trouble,
he gets into trouble.

21:24.723 --> 21:27.025
Now we're both going to get
into trouble if we're late.

21:27.026 --> 21:28.813
If? If he gets into trouble?

21:28.828 --> 21:31.416
Not if. When.
He's going to get into trouble.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.833
In fact, he's going to be
testing you and everyone else

21:33.834 --> 21:35.469
to see how much trouble he can get into.

21:35.470 --> 21:37.776
So you better take a
really firm stand with him

21:37.777 --> 21:40.261
and tell him you're not going
to have anything to do with him

21:40.262 --> 21:41.743
if he gets into any trouble at all.

21:41.744 --> 21:44.613
Do not be his friend, Amy. Be his parent.

21:44.614 --> 21:46.960
He understands parent,
he responds to parent,

21:46.961 --> 21:49.127
he responds to being
lectured and threatened

21:49.128 --> 21:50.864
and disciplined, he needs all that.

21:50.865 --> 21:52.742
He needs and wants a parent.

21:52.743 --> 21:55.216
I'm not his parent and I
don't want to be his parent.

21:55.217 --> 21:56.764
I'm a high school senior.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.817
Okay? I want to enjoy my senior year

21:58.818 --> 22:01.770
and act like a high school senior,
not like someone's parent.

22:03.093 --> 22:05.590
Well, except for John of
course, but he's two.

22:05.730 --> 22:06.832
And you know what, like every other kid,

22:06.833 --> 22:08.882
Ethan needs love and trust.

22:08.883 --> 22:10.761
Maybe he responds to the expectation

22:10.762 --> 22:13.819
that he will do the right thing
because people care about him.

22:13.864 --> 22:16.282
You shouldn't just expect him
to fail or get into trouble.

22:16.283 --> 22:18.030
Okay. Fine.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.977
I was going to read him the riot
act and tell him specifically

22:20.978 --> 22:22.606
what to do today and what not to do,

22:22.607 --> 22:23.735
but you go ahead.

22:23.736 --> 22:24.933
Let him do whatever he wants to do,

22:24.934 --> 22:26.334
be nice to him, be his friend,

22:26.335 --> 22:28.766
see how that goes.
You two enjoy summer school.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.167
Oh, I'm going to.

22:30.887 --> 22:33.220
Quit telling me what to do, old man Ricky.

22:50.622 --> 22:52.219
I'm going to need some lunch money.

22:56.633 --> 22:58.276
It's right where we put it last night.

23:00.965 --> 23:03.166
It's our money, my money and your money.

23:03.167 --> 23:05.391
You don't have to ask, it's right here.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.756
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

23:12.003 --> 23:14.237
I should just leave you
alone about summer school.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.611
But please don't be nice to Ethan.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.704
Ricky, I can't not be nice to him.

23:20.084 --> 23:21.978
I'll see you when I get home, okay?

23:22.287 --> 23:25.287
Thank you for taking John and
thank you for everything.

23:25.809 --> 23:27.879
I love you. I love you, too.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.695
New school for you, you're
going to make new friends,

23:38.696 --> 23:41.125
and this can be a whole new life, Ethan.

23:41.325 --> 23:42.449
I mean, starting today,

23:42.450 --> 23:44.166
this could be a better life for you.

23:44.533 --> 23:45.975
I know you're going to do really well here.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.356
I hope so, Amy.

23:47.357 --> 23:49.567
I've been in so many schools
and in so many homes,

23:49.568 --> 23:52.213
it'd be great if I could find
somewhere where people are nice.

23:52.237 --> 23:53.603
You know, where I fit in.

23:54.332 --> 23:55.288
Hey, Amy.

23:56.151 --> 23:58.052
I'm not speaking to you. And hello,

23:58.053 --> 23:59.636
I'm in the middle of something here.

24:01.152 --> 24:03.316
What were you saying?
Hey, she's good looking.

24:03.317 --> 24:04.916
She's a senior, and she may

24:04.917 --> 24:07.245
be good looking but she's
not a nice person.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.441
Why do you say that?

24:08.727 --> 24:10.818
That skank actually showed up.

24:12.275 --> 24:14.540
Hi. I'm Lauren.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.781
This is Ethan. He's new.

24:15.782 --> 24:18.264
He's staying with Ricky's
mom, hopefully permanently.

24:18.265 --> 24:20.966
Yeah, hopefully.
If school works out for me and everything.

24:22.239 --> 24:24.355
I'm just gonna wander
around to get my bearings.

24:24.356 --> 24:25.650
Are you sure? I could show you around.

24:25.651 --> 24:27.590
Oh, no. That's okay, I got it.
I'm good at this.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.022
My navigational skills are excellent.

24:32.377 --> 24:35.025
I can't believe she had the
nerve to show her face.

24:35.154 --> 24:37.299
I was hoping she'd go
back to the food court

24:37.300 --> 24:39.677
to the hot dog stand and be with Stanley.

24:39.733 --> 24:41.009
He's sleazy enough for her.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.834
Well, he's too old for her.

24:42.835 --> 24:45.283
I think she should just take
a break from guys anyway.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.972
I don't think that's going to happen.

24:46.973 --> 24:49.055
I heard she's going out with Henry.

24:49.336 --> 24:50.533
What? Yeah.

24:50.534 --> 24:53.232
And he slept with Adrian at
the party, did you know that?

24:53.233 --> 24:55.195
I knew that Alice and Henry broke up,

24:55.196 --> 24:57.172
but Adrian and Henry?

24:57.252 --> 24:58.650
Oh, poor Ben.

24:58.651 --> 25:01.890
Poor Ben? Hello. Poor me. I loved Henry.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.637
I've known Henry ever
since the third grade,

25:03.638 --> 25:04.928
and it's not like I wasn't
having sex with him.

25:04.929 --> 25:06.716
I was having sex with him!

25:07.141 --> 25:08.853
And suddenly out of nowhere
he breaks up with me

25:08.854 --> 25:09.774
and then sleeps with Adrian.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.229
I'm so sorry, Alice.

25:11.230 --> 25:12.492
Men stink.

25:12.732 --> 25:14.179
Amen to that.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.070
You know, our best friend Madison
slept with my boyfriend Jesse.

25:18.071 --> 25:20.256
What? Yeah, she betrayed me.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.570
He betrayed you, too.

25:21.571 --> 25:24.189
Yeah, well, we all know how that happened.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.602
Well, it didn't happen because
you weren't having sex with him.

25:26.603 --> 25:28.059
Right. I'm proof that having sex with a guy

25:28.060 --> 25:30.145
won't keep him from having
sex with someone else.

25:30.146 --> 25:31.775
So is Henry going to summer school?

25:31.776 --> 25:33.800
Yes, it's the only reason I
signed up for summer school.

25:33.801 --> 25:36.647
He wanted to go so hopefully
he'd do better on the SATs

25:36.648 --> 25:38.591
and we could get into the same college.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.385
Well, you can hang out with us.

25:40.427 --> 25:41.445
Thank you.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.042
Hey, it's Ben! So Ben took your side?

25:46.043 --> 25:47.537
Of course he took my side,
I didn't do anything.

25:47.538 --> 25:49.527
And neither of us is speaking to Henry.

25:49.528 --> 25:52.109
I guess Alice is catching
you up on all the latest.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.202
What are you doing here?

25:53.203 --> 25:55.867
Part of my punishment.
I have to go to summer school.

25:55.868 --> 25:57.238
But I can't drive to summer school.

25:57.239 --> 25:58.771
My dad got a special driver

25:58.772 --> 26:00.822
to drive me to summer school and to work.

26:05.752 --> 26:07.350
Driver slash security guard.

26:07.525 --> 26:08.954
You need a security guard now?

26:08.955 --> 26:12.192
Driver slash security
guard slash babysitter.

26:12.193 --> 26:13.618
Apparently I'm a drug addict now.

26:13.619 --> 26:15.111
What are you talking about?

26:15.757 --> 26:18.448
I got busted. For marijuana.

26:19.816 --> 26:21.939
I met some girls at your boyfriend's party.

26:22.794 --> 26:25.022
Oh, yeah. The redhead. I saw you with her.

26:25.023 --> 26:26.185
She smokes pot?

26:26.186 --> 26:28.402
She and all of her friends. And me.

26:28.403 --> 26:30.261
And you're still letting your
dad believe it was your pot?

26:30.262 --> 26:31.717
It was my pot.

26:33.204 --> 26:34.155
See you.

26:38.776 --> 26:40.806
So Ben is smoking pot now?

26:41.717 --> 26:42.807
Geez, he must still be suffering

26:42.808 --> 26:44.843
from everything that's happened this year.

26:44.932 --> 26:47.634
Yeah. Or he's lost his mind.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.557
It's not enough that he
got Adrian pregnant,

26:50.558 --> 26:52.939
they lost a baby and he got a divorce.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.774
Now he needs more trouble in his life?

26:54.775 --> 26:56.561
I'm sure it's just part
of the healing process.

26:56.562 --> 26:58.542
I'm sure it's going to
take a long time for him,

26:58.543 --> 27:00.226
for him and Adrian to both heal.

27:01.589 --> 27:02.422
That's probably why they're

27:02.423 --> 27:04.573
both making some stupid
decisions right now.

27:06.266 --> 27:08.281
I feel so badly for both of them,

27:08.364 --> 27:10.654
and just slightly guilty that
Ricky and I are coming together

27:10.655 --> 27:12.308
right as they're falling apart.

27:13.228 --> 27:14.965
Hey, let me see your ring again.

27:17.138 --> 27:20.208
Isn't it funny how the one person
we thought would be a cheater

27:20.209 --> 27:22.179
is the one person who didn't cheat?

27:23.770 --> 27:25.696
Ricky? Yeah.

27:26.390 --> 27:28.000
Of course, he's not perfect.

27:29.253 --> 27:31.570
But neither am I.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.153
Yeah, it's right down there,

27:34.154 --> 27:35.635
just turn left at the end of the hall.

27:35.636 --> 27:36.647
Thank you.

27:36.648 --> 27:38.712
And by the way, I thought
Amy was very rude to you.

27:38.713 --> 27:40.722
You seem like a nice enough girl to me.

27:40.961 --> 27:44.167
Yeah. Amy used to be my best friend.
So did Lauren.

27:44.168 --> 27:45.933
And they just turned on you.

27:46.743 --> 27:49.241
Girls will do that, you know,
girls can be really mean.

27:49.242 --> 27:50.373
And unforgiving.

27:50.374 --> 27:51.346
So what happened?

27:51.347 --> 27:53.505
Did you do something they
won't forgive you for?

27:53.642 --> 27:56.637
I don't know what you could have
done, really, you seem so nice.

27:56.829 --> 27:59.645
I am nice. I just made a little mistake.

27:59.646 --> 28:01.111
It wasn't even my fault.

28:01.715 --> 28:02.944
Happens to me all the time.

28:02.945 --> 28:06.018
You want to do the right
thing, but then you don't.

28:06.047 --> 28:07.299
And you make one little mistake,

28:07.300 --> 28:08.934
and everyone makes a big deal out of it.

28:08.935 --> 28:12.621
Well, I kind of slept
with Lauren's boyfriend.

28:14.231 --> 28:16.113
You mean he slept with you?

28:16.211 --> 28:18.957
I honestly doubt you'd seduce
your best friend's boyfriend,

28:18.958 --> 28:20.696
you hardly seem like the type.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.077
You look like a classy girl to me,

28:22.078 --> 28:25.234
the kind of girl a guy
would be lucky to marry.

28:26.008 --> 28:26.894
Yeah?

28:26.895 --> 28:29.739
Yeah. And of course this guy
would want to sleep with you,

28:29.740 --> 28:31.346
I mean, look at you.

28:31.347 --> 28:33.948
Damn. Any guy would want to sleep with you.

28:34.123 --> 28:36.487
You're so good looking, you know that?

28:36.488 --> 28:39.757
And sexy, you are really sexy.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.592
You look all innocent, but hey, you're hot.

28:44.137 --> 28:46.951
So, like, who are you again?

28:49.284 --> 28:51.182
Are you related to Ricky?

28:59.829 --> 29:01.490
Hi, Adrian. Can we talk?

29:01.491 --> 29:03.940
Oh. Hi, Henry.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.550
This isn't about your
feelings or anything, is it?

29:08.551 --> 29:12.490
'Cause sometimes things are
just best left unsaid.

29:12.941 --> 29:15.404
I got all your messages, I just
didn't want to talk to you.

29:15.410 --> 29:16.960
I just wanted to apologize.

29:16.961 --> 29:20.647
Oh, no, no. That's okay.
You were pretty good.

29:20.823 --> 29:22.073
Nothing to apologize for.

29:22.074 --> 29:23.433
What? No.

29:23.530 --> 29:26.919
I just wanted to apologize
if I took advantage of you.

29:27.145 --> 29:28.284
What?

29:28.285 --> 29:30.076
Unless of course, you maybe
took advantage of me?

29:30.077 --> 29:34.438
Oh, no, no, no, no one
took advantage of anyone.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.953
You knew what you were doing.

29:35.954 --> 29:37.907
I already told you, you were pretty good,

29:37.908 --> 29:40.728
I mean considering that it
meant nothing to either of us

29:40.729 --> 29:41.972
and it was just party sex.

29:41.973 --> 29:44.105
Yeah, well, Ben knows, you know.

29:44.106 --> 29:44.976
I don't care if Ben knows.

29:44.977 --> 29:47.463
He's not speaking to me.
We're not friends anymore.

29:47.864 --> 29:50.094
What? What happened?

29:50.095 --> 29:52.279
What happened? Us. We happened.

29:52.293 --> 29:55.077
Yeah, so? Ben was with that redhead.

29:55.078 --> 29:59.864
Not that I'm keeping score.
But if I were, I'd win.

30:00.346 --> 30:01.734
He didn't have sex with that girl.

30:01.735 --> 30:03.909
He will. I've heard about
those private school girls.

30:03.910 --> 30:05.336
Don't let him make you feel guilty.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.417
Again, he's not speaking to me.

30:07.887 --> 30:09.152
Maybe you could talk to him.

30:09.153 --> 30:11.006
Maybe if he sees that it
wasn't a big deal to you

30:11.007 --> 30:14.110
he wouldn't be so upset with
me, and he'd forgive me.

30:14.308 --> 30:15.305
I'm not going to talk to him

30:15.306 --> 30:17.235
about you or any other guy I've slept with.

30:17.236 --> 30:20.027
It's none of his business.
It's just me being me.

30:20.454 --> 30:22.288
Or, the old me.

30:22.964 --> 30:25.966
There's a new me now.
I've changed since last week.

30:26.106 --> 30:29.490
It's been a long time
coming, but I've changed.

30:31.033 --> 30:35.142
Yeah, I met someone and I'm going
to be totally faithful to him.

30:36.132 --> 30:37.650
I may even be in love,

30:38.203 --> 30:39.942
really in love for the first time.

30:39.943 --> 30:42.294
You met someone in the last
week, after the party?

30:42.295 --> 30:44.688
No, it's that guy that I
came to the party with.

30:44.689 --> 30:45.920
You came there with someone?

30:45.921 --> 30:47.846
Hello. Yeah.

30:48.326 --> 30:50.289
He left right after he saw me kiss Ricky.

30:50.290 --> 30:52.442
Does he know we slept together?
Of course not!

30:52.443 --> 30:54.091
And no one's going to tell him.

30:54.121 --> 30:56.004
He's in college, so no one knows him.

30:56.059 --> 30:58.794
Except for Grace, but she
would never tell him.

31:00.341 --> 31:01.343
I hope.

31:11.042 --> 31:14.255
Hey. We can't let them get to us, you know.

31:14.375 --> 31:17.087
Impossible. I feel so lousy.

31:17.095 --> 31:18.981
I felt guilty enough that
I broke up with her,

31:18.982 --> 31:21.348
why the hell did I do something so stupid?

31:21.747 --> 31:23.821
Low self-esteem. That's what I have.

31:24.546 --> 31:27.531
I have extreme selfishness.

31:27.601 --> 31:29.284
Well, what are we going to do?

31:29.285 --> 31:30.685
I think we've done enough.

31:35.842 --> 31:37.505
Hi, Ben.

31:38.294 --> 31:39.489
Why are you in summer school?

31:39.490 --> 31:41.386
Why do you care? I don't.

31:41.655 --> 31:43.269
Just don't be mean to Henry.

31:43.731 --> 31:47.569
What we did did not mean anything
to either of us, all right?

31:47.570 --> 31:48.937
Not all right.

31:49.014 --> 31:51.997
And I'm not so upset with
you as I am with Henry.

31:52.145 --> 31:54.479
Who you're with is your
business, I suppose,

31:54.480 --> 31:55.942
but Henry was my best friend.

31:55.943 --> 31:58.372
Best friends are hard to come
by, you should forgive him.

31:58.373 --> 32:00.085
Did Christ forgive Judas?

32:00.086 --> 32:01.309
I think he did.

32:01.459 --> 32:03.130
Really? Yeah.

32:03.265 --> 32:05.792
Well, maybe he shouldn't have.

32:22.334 --> 32:24.370
Well, look who's here.

32:24.555 --> 32:26.049
And I thought it would just be me.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.347
Of course you would think
that, because everything

32:27.348 --> 32:29.353
is always about just you, isn't it?

32:30.824 --> 32:31.883
Alice.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.639
Why should you reprimand Alice?

32:33.724 --> 32:35.378
Apparently, you don't
know right from wrong.

32:35.379 --> 32:37.226
Leave Henry alone, he made a mistake

32:37.227 --> 32:38.827
and he feels badly about it.

32:38.828 --> 32:40.850
It doesn't matter how
badly he feels about it,

32:40.851 --> 32:42.090
he still did something wrong.

32:42.091 --> 32:44.098
Yeah. And you can't do something that wrong

32:44.099 --> 32:46.456
and expect that everyone is
just going to forget about it.

32:46.457 --> 32:48.979
Why not? We would all forget
about your big mistake

32:48.980 --> 32:50.627
if you weren't always carrying him around

32:50.628 --> 32:52.598
like some sort of fashion accessory.

32:53.412 --> 32:57.412
Don't you dare refer to John as a mistake!
Or an accessory!

32:57.413 --> 33:00.128
Fine! We'd all forget about
your unplanned pregnancy

33:00.129 --> 33:01.623
if you weren't carrying
him around with you.

33:01.624 --> 33:04.353
Why you little... Take that back!

33:04.457 --> 33:07.086
Oh, just shut up, Amy.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.591
What?

33:08.674 --> 33:11.680
I have been waiting for someone
to say that for years!

33:11.841 --> 33:12.740
And if you were just trying

33:12.741 --> 33:14.488
to prevent someone from
saying something about,

33:14.489 --> 33:17.359
you know, what happened
to us, thank you, Ben.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.882
Even though we're divorced,
you're still very thoughtful.

33:21.243 --> 33:23.548
No, he's not. He's probably just stoned.

33:23.549 --> 33:25.209
Hey! Hey!

33:25.210 --> 33:27.014
All of you! Detention.

33:28.325 --> 33:29.509
Sorry I'm late.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.689
Some new student broke
into the condom stash

33:31.690 --> 33:32.630
in the school nurse's

33:32.631 --> 33:35.190
office creating some
more unnecessary chaos.

33:35.297 --> 33:36.708
I hate summer school.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.306
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm here, I'm here.

33:39.307 --> 33:40.922
Yes, you are here, and you're late.

33:40.923 --> 33:43.402
So, sit down, and you have detention, too.

33:47.095 --> 33:48.584
I got kicked out of med camp.

33:48.585 --> 33:49.436
So I will be living with you

33:49.437 --> 33:51.613
because I'm probably going to
get kicked out of my house.

33:52.706 --> 33:56.311
All right, well, welcome back.

33:58.074 --> 34:00.990
Excuse me, is Amy Juergens in this class?

34:00.991 --> 34:02.107
Yes.

34:06.067 --> 34:07.369
Yeah, I'm in this class.

34:07.370 --> 34:08.641
You want to come to my office, please?

34:08.643 --> 34:11.130
We need to have a word
with your friend, Ethan.

34:21.496 --> 34:22.871
Psst! Ben!

34:41.300 --> 34:44.237
I lied. I lied to my own mother.

34:44.491 --> 34:46.726
She paid a lot of money for med camp.

34:47.226 --> 34:48.737
And I didn't give them any
notice I was cancelling

34:48.737 --> 34:50.873
so she can't get her money
back and now I have a mark

34:50.875 --> 34:53.219
on my permanent record
for getting kicked out.

34:54.045 --> 34:56.264
They kicked you out just for being late?

34:56.536 --> 34:58.522
No. Not just for being late.

34:59.061 --> 35:01.231
I sort of went off on Grant.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.340
I tried to claim that he

35:02.341 --> 35:04.733
was supposed to pick me up and he didn't.

35:04.848 --> 35:07.361
And then he called me a
liar in front of everyone.

35:07.362 --> 35:09.945
I mean, I've been one of the star
students at med camp for years.

35:09.946 --> 35:11.558
Now, everyone thinks I'm a big liar.

35:11.559 --> 35:13.435
And that is not a good quality in a doctor.

35:13.436 --> 35:14.654
Are you kidding me?

35:14.655 --> 35:16.763
Looks like they'd give you
extra credit for that.

35:17.893 --> 35:19.461
Look, I think you should just go to bed,

35:19.462 --> 35:21.631
get some rest, start fresh in the morning.

35:21.632 --> 35:24.409
I don't have a TV in there, and
I don't feel like going to bed.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.803
Hey, Adrian, is Grace home?

35:38.985 --> 35:40.886
I see she's home.

35:41.462 --> 35:43.660
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

35:43.661 --> 35:45.051
Other than lying to your mother.

35:45.052 --> 35:46.635
She called me, and she called Grant.

35:46.636 --> 35:48.362
She even called Daniel looking for you.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.009
I think Daniel told her you were over here.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.334
How does he know?

35:51.335 --> 35:53.630
I'll just be in my bedroom.

35:53.631 --> 35:55.080
Let Omar in, will you?

35:55.289 --> 35:58.841
You told Omar and Omar told
Daniel and Daniel told my mother.

36:00.886 --> 36:02.013
Are you all right?

36:04.021 --> 36:05.087
I will be.

36:05.420 --> 36:06.190
Once I get over the

36:06.191 --> 36:08.734
embarrassment of getting
kicked out of med camp.

36:08.862 --> 36:09.972
Yeah. Grant told me.

36:09.973 --> 36:11.586
Would you two quit talking?

36:11.602 --> 36:12.546
Eventually.

36:14.362 --> 36:16.382
Would you consider going out with me

36:16.383 --> 36:19.339
since you're not at med camp and
since you and Daniel broke up?

36:20.209 --> 36:21.450
No. I can't.

36:21.797 --> 36:22.596
Why not?

36:22.597 --> 36:25.139
Because when my mom calls, I
want to be able to tell her

36:25.140 --> 36:27.733
that I'm keeping my promise
of focusing on school

36:27.734 --> 36:30.442
and not being with any guys all summer.

36:30.443 --> 36:31.874
Then why are you here?

36:32.035 --> 36:33.560
Why don't you come home with me?

36:33.561 --> 36:34.220
Oh, yeah, you're at my

36:34.221 --> 36:36.382
house because I'm supposed
to be at med camp.

36:36.469 --> 36:38.087
We both could be at the house.

36:38.773 --> 36:39.530
I think that she would

36:39.531 --> 36:41.669
like that you were home
instead of over here.

36:41.670 --> 36:42.775
I don't know.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.595
This is what I wanted to do this summer.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.562
I wanted to live here with Adrian,

36:48.569 --> 36:50.484
and I want to go to summer school.

36:51.718 --> 36:54.242
I just really want to do what I want to do.

36:55.562 --> 36:56.826
Don't we all?

36:59.163 --> 37:00.260
Grace, I love you.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.246
And when your mom gets back,

37:02.247 --> 37:05.052
I'm going to be all out of excuses
for living at your house,

37:05.187 --> 37:06.905
and then I'm going to have to go home.

37:07.346 --> 37:09.263
Of course, I want to go home to my family.

37:09.264 --> 37:13.698
I'm happy they're back.
But I'm going to miss you.

37:15.122 --> 37:17.055
Maybe when you're seeing guys again,

37:17.616 --> 37:19.561
maybe you could think about seeing me.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.308
Maybe we could give it just one more shot.

37:23.016 --> 37:25.694
Not tonight, not this week,
maybe not even this summer,

37:25.695 --> 37:30.067
but when you're ready to go out again.
Think about it.

37:30.993 --> 37:32.314
Please go out with me.

37:33.742 --> 37:35.841
He's waiting for me in the parking lot.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.647
We're going over to his place. Goodnight.

37:42.685 --> 37:45.788
So should I leave?

38:09.805 --> 38:11.962
You sure you don't know
whose phone that was?

38:12.395 --> 38:14.280
I'm gonna find out sooner or later.

38:14.864 --> 38:17.376
All right. It was Alice's.

38:17.497 --> 38:19.659
I borrowed it three days ago.

38:19.860 --> 38:21.130
I've been talking to Dylan

38:21.131 --> 38:23.804
practically the whole time we
weren't supposed to be talking.

38:24.019 --> 38:25.331
We have a house phone, you know.

38:25.332 --> 38:27.101
Ah, at last the truth.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.691
Anything else you want to tell me?

38:28.956 --> 38:30.205
It wasn't my pot.

38:30.695 --> 38:32.670
It was their pot. They brought it over.

38:33.052 --> 38:35.811
I was just covering because Dylan
got into some trouble before

38:35.812 --> 38:37.575
and I didn't want her to
get into any more trouble.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.781
This girl is not the
girl for you, Benjamin.

38:40.039 --> 38:41.916
She's trouble with a capital T.

38:41.917 --> 38:44.077
You don't love her, you two
don't even know each other.

38:44.078 --> 38:45.321
We're getting to know each other.

38:45.322 --> 38:47.076
I don't like that she shows up here

38:47.077 --> 38:49.849
unannounced with her friends
and brings pot with her.

38:49.850 --> 38:51.858
It bothers you when people
show up unannounced?

38:51.859 --> 38:54.523
You like Henry, he's been showing
up for years unannounced.

38:54.524 --> 38:56.316
He doesn't bring pot
with him when he comes.

38:56.317 --> 38:59.716
I don't like her parents showing
up unannounced, snooping around.

38:59.717 --> 39:01.991
Henry's parents have never
shown up unannounced.

39:01.992 --> 39:05.165
And they never will.
Because I'm never speaking to him again.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.603
Are you speaking to Adrian?

39:07.223 --> 39:09.323
Yes. When it's impolite not to.

39:09.324 --> 39:11.704
What happened was as much
her fault as it is Henry's.

39:11.705 --> 39:15.836
No, it wasn't. And, as long as
we're telling the truth here,

39:15.837 --> 39:19.183
I care much more about Henry
than I ever did about Adrian.

39:19.780 --> 39:22.553
He was my best friend,
I've known him forever,

39:22.554 --> 39:25.325
and I thought I could
trust him with my life.

39:25.608 --> 39:27.055
And my soon-to-be ex-wife.

39:27.056 --> 39:29.731
You can't let a woman come between
you and your best friend.

39:29.732 --> 39:32.887
Honestly, Dad, right now
I don't care about Henry

39:32.888 --> 39:35.642
or Adrian or anyone but Dylan.

39:35.656 --> 39:38.555
I am obsessed with Dylan.
I have to see her again

39:38.556 --> 39:41.295
and no matter what you do to
me, I'm going to see her.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.526
When did defiance become
an option in this house?

39:43.527 --> 39:45.062
Please, Dad, please.

39:45.063 --> 39:46.227
She smokes pot!

39:46.228 --> 39:47.646
I didn't know she smoked pot.

39:47.647 --> 39:50.614
She doesn't smoke pot all the time,
and she's a really nice girl,

39:50.615 --> 39:51.976
and she's never had sex and

39:51.977 --> 39:54.584
she's innocent and beautiful
and smart, and...

39:55.124 --> 39:56.742
I don't know, Dad, look,

39:56.821 --> 39:59.058
I can live without pot or alcohol,

39:59.103 --> 40:01.403
but I just can't live without her.

40:01.404 --> 40:04.345
Well, you're going to have to, Romeo.
And that's an order.

40:10.023 --> 40:10.987
Hey.

40:12.246 --> 40:15.314
I just want to say that you
were right and I was wrong.

40:15.863 --> 40:17.769
You know what he wanted the condoms for?

40:17.923 --> 40:19.717
I would assume sex.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.203
Yeah. He thought he might have a
chance at your friend, Madison.

40:23.783 --> 40:24.632
He might.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.641
She's not going to have sex with him.

40:26.642 --> 40:30.273
He's 14 turning 15.
He would be underage for her.

40:30.274 --> 40:32.237
She's 18. She could get arrested.

40:32.238 --> 40:34.357
Well, if his parents or
guardians press charges,

40:34.358 --> 40:36.635
but your parents wouldn't
do that, would they?

40:36.636 --> 40:38.658
No, no, doesn't work that way anymore.

40:38.659 --> 40:41.073
No one has to press charges
except the police.

40:41.074 --> 40:42.510
Oh. I didn't know.

40:43.924 --> 40:45.137
Is your mom upset with me?

40:45.138 --> 40:48.038
No. No, she's upset with me.

40:48.516 --> 40:50.048
She was counting on me to

40:50.049 --> 40:52.595
pressure him into behaving
at school his first day.

40:52.641 --> 40:55.189
Yeah, I should have let you do that.

40:55.890 --> 40:57.119
I should have done that.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.073
You should have done that.

40:58.074 --> 40:59.565
And you? And me?

40:59.566 --> 41:00.947
You should have done what?

41:02.667 --> 41:05.466
I should have put a little
more pressure on him myself.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.381
I just thought he would respond better

41:07.382 --> 41:09.801
to kindness and trust
and love and all that.

41:09.802 --> 41:11.015
He doesn't know those things,

41:11.016 --> 41:12.823
those things are foreign to him.

41:12.824 --> 41:14.504
And he's a guy, a young guy.

41:14.754 --> 41:15.880
It's not that he's stupid,

41:15.881 --> 41:17.985
he just has to be told exactly what to do

41:17.986 --> 41:19.397
and then he'll do it. Maybe.

41:19.398 --> 41:20.829
Not that anyone can anticipate

41:20.830 --> 41:21.946
what possible trouble he'll

41:21.947 --> 41:24.843
consider day to day, but here's an example.

41:24.844 --> 41:27.280
You have to say, "Do not short
change the cafeteria lady.

41:27.281 --> 41:28.421
"Do not write graffiti

41:28.422 --> 41:30.548
on the bathroom wall or on school property.

41:30.549 --> 41:32.949
"Go to class, do not
steal or borrow anything

41:32.950 --> 41:35.377
"From any other students'
backpacks during class.

41:35.378 --> 41:38.020
"Do not have sex at school
or on school property,

41:38.021 --> 41:40.537
"And if you do have sex
off school property,

41:40.612 --> 41:43.881
"Do not have sex in a parked
car or a public place

41:43.882 --> 41:46.895
"And wherever you are, use a condom."

41:46.896 --> 41:48.243
You have to spell it out.

41:48.244 --> 41:51.155
Maybe not, I mean, he was
trying to get condoms,

41:51.156 --> 41:52.669
maybe he already knows all that stuff.

41:52.670 --> 41:54.080
And maybe he doesn't.

41:54.129 --> 41:56.993
Taking a kid in like that is a lot of work,

41:56.994 --> 41:59.001
for my parents and for us,

41:59.141 --> 42:00.811
it's going to be a lot of work for us.

42:00.812 --> 42:01.770
Yeah.

42:02.338 --> 42:03.889
Okay. Well, I'll do better tomorrow.

42:03.890 --> 42:05.913
You have tomorrow off,
and the next day off,

42:05.914 --> 42:07.581
Ethan is suspended for two days.

42:07.582 --> 42:09.234
What? That seems kind of harsh.

42:09.433 --> 42:11.174
No, it's not harsh at all.

42:11.175 --> 42:12.987
Kicking him out of school would be harsh,

42:12.988 --> 42:15.258
letting him out for two days is not harsh.

42:16.318 --> 42:17.578
Where's he going to be?

42:17.899 --> 42:18.866
Guess.

42:19.414 --> 42:20.391
With you?

42:22.412 --> 42:24.795
Ricky, I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry.

42:24.796 --> 42:26.715
I tried to warn you. I know.

42:26.900 --> 42:31.068
It's just that you have to
trust me more and Ethan less.

42:31.274 --> 42:33.333
I know. I mean, I like the kid.

42:33.334 --> 42:36.099
But you have no idea what he's capable of.

42:43.673 --> 42:45.264
You let Ethan in the apartment alone

42:45.265 --> 42:47.159
after everything he did at school today?

42:56.467 --> 42:58.346
I took it out when I dropped him off.

42:59.007 --> 43:01.495
See, I did learn a little
something at summer school.
