WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:10.677
Ba-bum.

00:11.970 --> 00:12.887
[croaks]

00:14.723 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.016 --> 00:19.394
[man]  Previously on  The Dragon Prince...

00:20.562 --> 00:25.483
Whatever happens, whatever accidents
or tragedies may occur...

00:26.067 --> 00:29.404
above all else,
you must return with that egg!

00:29.487 --> 00:30.447
I understand.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.742
Humans weren't born with magic.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.785
We were born with nothing.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.621
But we still found a way
to do amazing things.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.332
That's what dark magic
is really all about.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.004
I'm sorry. It's just not for me.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.224
Why should I trust you?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.982
Hey, what was that? A shadow?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.943
There's something up there.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.033
[theme music playing]

01:29.756 --> 01:31.049
[roaring]

01:59.494 --> 02:01.788
-[device humming]
-[croaks inquisitively]

02:08.545 --> 02:10.004
What do you think this thing is, anyway?

02:10.880 --> 02:11.923
[snorts]

02:12.006 --> 02:15.260
He said it was a key, but a key to what?

02:15.343 --> 02:19.389
You practicing magic or are you losing
to Bait at a game of rolly-cubes?

02:20.723 --> 02:21.724
Magic.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.268
I think I'm getting close.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.146
There's so much swirling around
in my head,

02:26.229 --> 02:28.356
but I need a way to bring it all together.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.359
-Like some kind of breakthrough?
-Yeah.

02:32.152 --> 02:32.986
[Bait snorts]

02:33.903 --> 02:36.906
What about you? You were born
with the Moon Arcanum.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.242
Uh, I suppose so?

02:39.325 --> 02:43.538
So when you do cool moon powers,
you're connecting to the moon, right?

02:43.621 --> 02:44.664
What does that feel like?

02:45.248 --> 02:47.584
Uh, I don't really think about it.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.295
I just stand in the light
of the full moon,

02:50.378 --> 02:51.713
and then there's a feeling like...

02:51.796 --> 02:53.965
[mimics whooshing]

02:54.048 --> 02:55.800
And then there's a sort of... ting!

02:55.884 --> 02:58.303
And then...
[exclaims] Moonshadow powers!

02:58.386 --> 02:59.387
[voice echoing]

03:00.221 --> 03:01.222
Does that help?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.100
No, not at all. But I enjoyed it.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.523
Once we're in town, we can ditch Corvus
in jail or something

03:10.607 --> 03:11.691
and be done with him.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.778
We're so far off
Callum and Ezran's trail now.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.405
Do you think we can catch up with them?

03:17.488 --> 03:19.908
Of course we can! We promised Dad.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.661
You know, I could help you track them,
if you untied me.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.374
[laughing] No, no, no, no.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.586
If I untie you,
you're just gonna try and escape.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.921
Again.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.839
No, not this time.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.508
This time will be different. I promise.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.387
-Huh.
-Pfft, no!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.264
Hey, hey!

03:45.016 --> 03:46.517
Fool me once, shame on you.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.103
Fool me twice, shame on me.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.690
Fool me three times, back to you again.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.026
That's not how it goes.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.363
Shame on you.

04:00.031 --> 04:00.865
[grunts]

04:06.412 --> 04:08.498
I have to be a mage again.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.251
We saw a dragon in the clouds yesterday.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.795
Things will only get tougher
once we get into Xadia.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.048
And crossing the border?
That's going to be crazy dangerous.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.550
Eh, well...

04:20.343 --> 04:21.719
maybe not.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.055
There's a river of lava!

04:24.764 --> 04:26.808
One does not simply walk into Xadia.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.479
Actually, one does simply walk into Xadia.

04:31.562 --> 04:35.024
There's a secret path, the Moonstone Path.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.237
It'll be safe and easy, even for you,
magic or no magic.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.656
Come get some rest.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.867
[sighs] You're right.
Let's go back to sleep.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.665
[croaking nervously]

04:57.422 --> 04:58.798
[horse neighing]

05:07.223 --> 05:09.392
Excuse me. Excuse me.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.019
We're looking for a town jail?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.104
We've got a horrible traitor to lock up

05:13.187 --> 05:16.858
for, uh, traitorous words and deeds.
Standard traitor stuff.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.943
[crowd muttering]

05:21.404 --> 05:24.115
Excuse me? Crownguard here.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.659
Oh, something's weird.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.745
I know! No one's listening to me.

05:29.996 --> 05:30.997
What?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.167
There! It's back.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.752
[crowd exclaiming]

05:38.838 --> 05:41.132
-Is that...
-A dragon?

05:52.977 --> 05:54.312
[crowd exclaiming]

05:57.273 --> 05:59.984
[soldier] Yeah, it's the third night
in a row it's flown over us.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.070
And you haven't shot it down yet?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.072
What are those ballistas for?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.365
Well, it hasn't attacked us.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.787
So? It's the enemy.
I'm taking command here.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.663
Crownguard, I might have mentioned.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.465
Hold on! The dragon isn't attacking.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.383
It's just trying to intimidate us.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.052
[scoffs] Well, then,

06:26.135 --> 06:29.138
I'll just have to show it
that humans won't be intimidated.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.224
[roaring]

06:42.401 --> 06:45.321
Soren, please. Don't start a fight
you can't finish.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.658
[roaring]

06:58.334 --> 07:00.711
Ha! See? Scared it off.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.505
Dragon problem solved.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.507
[dragon roaring]

07:08.511 --> 07:10.012
[roaring]

07:10.096 --> 07:12.306
Oh, no. I know that sound.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.976
That's not a good sound.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.270
[Zym yips]

07:22.233 --> 07:23.401
[whimpers]

07:23.484 --> 07:26.195
Wait, we don't know
if it's safe out there.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.905
Bait, stay with Zym.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.829
[dragon roaring]

07:44.964 --> 07:45.798
Get down!

07:53.347 --> 07:54.974
What's it doing here?

07:55.057 --> 07:56.976
Why is it attacking that town?

07:57.059 --> 07:59.270
Uh, I don't know.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.606
[townsfolk screaming]

08:04.233 --> 08:06.527
Don't just stand there!
Get on those ballistas!

08:08.112 --> 08:10.948
It's circling back. Get ready to fire.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.414
Fire!

08:41.312 --> 08:42.230
Soren!

08:42.313 --> 08:43.272
What are you... [yells]

08:47.985 --> 08:49.237
I don't understand.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.115
These people need help.
Get as many as you can to safety.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.413
Don't get yourself killed.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.924
I think I really messed up
this time, Clauds.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.718
I... I don't know how to stop it.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.179
Don't say that yet. I have an idea.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.431
It's the eye of a gryphon.

09:17.515 --> 09:22.603
With this, I can enchant a ballista bolt
to never miss its target, no matter what.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.021
Ugh!

09:24.689 --> 09:27.567
So you just carry a gryphon eyeball
around with you?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.484
Who does that?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.071
Oh, how about, "Thank you for carrying
a gryphon's eye with you, Claudia.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.865
You're so prepared. You're the best."

09:38.744 --> 09:39.996
Thank you, Claudia.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.833
-You're the best!
-[chuckles]

09:44.875 --> 09:46.085
[roaring]

09:51.757 --> 09:55.136
[chanting]

10:04.687 --> 10:05.605
[roaring]

10:06.397 --> 10:07.690
[grunts]

10:10.276 --> 10:11.110
[roars]

10:11.193 --> 10:12.236
[exclaims]

10:29.837 --> 10:31.213
[groaning]

10:31.297 --> 10:32.131
They hit it!

10:38.220 --> 10:39.430
Get down!

10:49.273 --> 10:50.149
[Callum] Ezran!

10:59.617 --> 11:00.743
Is it dead?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.179
[groaning softly]

11:22.098 --> 11:22.932
[gasps]

11:47.373 --> 11:48.666
How dare you?

11:50.876 --> 11:54.046
You used King Harrow's seal
to summon the Pentarchy

11:54.130 --> 11:56.006
and then you lied to them.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.801
You called yourself the Regent of Katolis.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.887
You committed treason, Viren,
and for what?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.641
[sighs] For nothing.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.562
You'll be removed
from the Council for this,

12:09.645 --> 12:11.772
and you'll be lucky if that's all.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.736
[Ezran] You're in pain.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.947
Don't worry. We can help you.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.782
[breathing heavily]

12:27.663 --> 12:29.081
There! Beneath her wing.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.293
[dragon groaning softly]

12:33.169 --> 12:35.004
[Rayla] Come on. Help me.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.841
[all grunting]

12:41.469 --> 12:42.303
[grunts]

12:48.684 --> 12:49.894
[horse neighing]

12:52.938 --> 12:53.939
What are you doing?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.901
The humans are coming.
We have to protect her.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.402
We can't fight them, Rayla.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.904
I can't just leave her.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.656
Callum's right.
And we have to get back to Zym.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.366
We did what we could.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.369
Come on.

13:22.927 --> 13:27.056
I always thought it'd be you
who took down a dragon, not me.

13:27.139 --> 13:27.973
Huh?

13:28.057 --> 13:30.893
I mean, wasn't this
one of your life goals?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.811
Slaying a dragon? [chuckles]

13:32.895 --> 13:34.021
Yes.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.775
Huh. It's funny,
because I don't really care about it.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.027
But... [chuckles]

13:41.153 --> 13:45.199
I think it's dead,
but we can't be too sure.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.285
Secure the dragon!

13:54.041 --> 13:55.793
Zym! Zym, are you okay?

13:57.419 --> 13:58.837
[whimpering]

14:00.172 --> 14:01.632
[snorting]

14:02.424 --> 14:04.051
[Zym whimpering]

14:05.803 --> 14:07.346
I should have done something.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.265
Rayla, you're always the one

14:09.348 --> 14:13.394
who reminds us that the only thing
that matters is getting Zym back to Xadia.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.104
Why are you hesitating now?

14:15.187 --> 14:18.482
I'm not hesitating. This is different.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.069
Every fiber in my body
is telling me this is wrong.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.906
That dragon is defenseless
and I just left her there.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.336
Welcome back!
I hope you had a pleasant trip.

14:39.920 --> 14:45.426
How can you possibly remain so cheerful
in your dire circumstances?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.178
Well, I think about it like this,

14:48.262 --> 14:53.767
why see myself as chained down,
when I can be chained up?

14:53.851 --> 14:54.685
[metal clanging]

14:56.186 --> 14:57.646
I admire your tenacity.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.954
[breathes deeply]

15:14.538 --> 15:16.290
I have nothing left to lose.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.926
[Claudia] There's so many things
we can do with a dragon.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.930
There's even a chapter about spells
that use dragon snot.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.057
It's some powerful goo.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.226
We don't have the Dragon Prince,

15:36.310 --> 15:39.855
but do you think if we brought this dragon
home, Dad would...

15:39.939 --> 15:41.190
It's something, but...

15:41.273 --> 15:44.944
it does weigh, I don't know,
about a million tons?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.445
How are we gonna move it?

15:47.613 --> 15:48.614
In pieces.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.451
[Callum] I don't get it, Rayla.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.996
Why are you so worried about a dragon
that just set fire to a town?

15:57.831 --> 16:00.542
I've been thinking about something
someone once told me.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.838
About how when one person hurts another,
then that person hurts them back,

16:04.922 --> 16:07.383
it becomes a cycle that never ends.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.968
Who told you that?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.720
-You did.
-Oh.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.472
But, Callum, to break that cycle,

16:13.555 --> 16:16.016
someone has to take a stand
when no one else will.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.104
You're right.
If we're really going to change things,

16:20.187 --> 16:23.190
we can't just watch while humans and Xadia
keep hurting each other.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.859
But how do I take a stand?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.195
Believe me, I want to go
down there with you,

16:28.278 --> 16:31.281
and be the heroes who stop
all the fighting and save the day,

16:31.365 --> 16:32.533
but I can't do that.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.118
I can't do anything!

16:35.119 --> 16:38.247
It's okay, Callum.
I'm not asking you to come with me.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.333
Protecting that dragon doesn't just feel
like the right thing to do,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.460
it feels like the right thing
for me to do.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.421
It's where I'm meant to be.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.633
I'm going back down there.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.346
If I don't come back,
you and Ezran can get Zym to Xadia.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.639
I believe in you.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.474
Wait, Rayla!

17:08.777 --> 17:10.362
[breathes deeply]

17:12.448 --> 17:14.700
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.786
Live or die, this dragon goes home.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.566
Ugh, this guy again. Of course.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.986
A dead dragon and a dead elf
all in one day.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.197
Everything's coming up Soren.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.657
[grunts]

17:56.200 --> 17:57.367
[grunts]

18:00.996 --> 18:01.872
[exclaims]

18:04.333 --> 18:05.501
[both grunting]

18:15.177 --> 18:16.512
-[Zym yips]
-[Ezran laughs]

18:17.179 --> 18:18.180
What are you doing?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.307
I'm just drawing, Ezran.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.225
You seem upset.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.310
Yep. I draw when I'm upset.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.274
Argh!

18:39.910 --> 18:41.829
Maybe there is something I can do.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.333
Ezran, you have to stay here.
Protect Bait and Zym.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.253
-[Zym exclaims]
-Hey!

18:50.712 --> 18:52.756
-[Zym whimpers]
-Don't worry, Zym.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.800
We're gonna have fun while they're gone.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.594
Why don't we play a game?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.054
[squawks]

18:59.138 --> 19:00.514
[Rayla groans]

19:07.104 --> 19:08.147
[groans faintly]

19:11.233 --> 19:13.819
[Soren] Ooh, yeah. The thing about chains?

19:13.902 --> 19:15.988
They're made of metal. Hard to cut.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.614
[panting]

19:20.868 --> 19:22.411
I'm not backing down.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.873
Try not to kill her, Soren.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.833
She can lead us to Ezran and Callum.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.126
[Callum] She doesn't have to.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.421
I'm right here.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.674
[exclaims] Callum! You're safe!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.097
What are you doing?

19:43.473 --> 19:44.725
Your kind of magic.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.644
You don't want to do this, Callum.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.272
It's really dangerous
unless someone shows you how.

19:50.939 --> 19:51.940
You already did.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.571
[chanting]

20:04.369 --> 20:05.204
[hissing]

20:14.046 --> 20:15.422
[soldiers gasping]

20:15.505 --> 20:16.840
[soldiers yelling]

20:19.843 --> 20:22.054
Get up. You're free.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.890
[Soren] Congratulations!

20:25.515 --> 20:27.684
That was impressive. Really.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.771
You did everything you could
to save a monster

20:30.854 --> 20:33.273
that torched a town of innocent people.

20:33.357 --> 20:37.152
But it didn't even matter.
You freed a dead dragon.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.781
[growling softly]

20:45.160 --> 20:47.120
[roaring]

21:08.016 --> 21:09.393
Still bad at this, buddy.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.228
[croaks]

21:11.979 --> 21:13.063
Now, where's Zym?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.819
Oh, no. I'm so stupid.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.029
-Hide and seek was a really bad idea.
-[croaks]

21:21.113 --> 21:22.698
[roaring]

21:27.828 --> 21:30.080
-[grunts]
-We have to get out of here!

21:30.914 --> 21:32.874
-[dragon roaring]
-[soldiers screaming]

21:38.088 --> 21:39.715
[Soren shouting]

21:41.508 --> 21:42.926
[roaring]

21:45.554 --> 21:46.596
[Soren exclaims]

21:50.058 --> 21:51.018
[groans]

22:02.279 --> 22:03.405
-[Zym whimpers]
-[Ezran] Zym!

22:03.488 --> 22:04.906
[whimpering]

22:06.742 --> 22:08.285
[roaring]

22:26.136 --> 22:28.597
The little dragon's coming with me.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.767
[chanting]

22:33.351 --> 22:34.186
[Soren] Claudia!

22:38.940 --> 22:40.317
Help me.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.863
Soren!

22:45.989 --> 22:46.823
I'm here.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.662
Come on, get up.
We have to get you some help.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.373
I... I can't move, Claudia.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.125
I can't move!

23:10.889 --> 23:11.973
I'm ready.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.896
[exclaims]

24:00.856 --> 24:03.400
[breathing heavily]

24:05.318 --> 24:06.653
[grunts]

24:08.738 --> 24:09.781
Speak.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.494
[stammering]

24:15.203 --> 24:19.666
-I...
-[man] Speak, so I may hear you.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.670
[gasps]

24:24.254 --> 24:26.673
Who... who are you?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.633
Ah...

24:29.926 --> 24:34.973
How long I have waited to hear
the sound of another voice.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.061
How may I serve you?
