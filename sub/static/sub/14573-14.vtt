WEBVTT

00:48.149 --> 00:49.417
Excuse me.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.619
Hey, that's--
That's my sofa.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.121
Okay.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.123
Hey-- What are you
doing with my sofa?

00:55.156 --> 00:57.258
The lady upstairs.

00:59.293 --> 01:03.431
(indistinct chatter)

01:15.776 --> 01:16.744
(Pamela)
Yeah, get it.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.646
Now you.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.348
No, you aren't.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.584
Hi!

01:23.617 --> 01:25.286
Daddy.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.654
Hi.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.459
Girls, look at
your dad's face.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.264
What the-- What the hell?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.065
Oh, you had to get
new stuff.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.568
All of that
shit was horrible.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.636
Daddy, we got rid
of the ugly couch,

01:42.670 --> 01:44.338
the ugly table and all
the ugly chairs.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.473
Where are we gonna get-

01:45.506 --> 01:46.507
Where are we
gonna get new-

01:46.540 --> 01:47.775
Where am I gonna
get new stuff?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.343
I don't know.
that's your problem,

01:49.377 --> 01:51.545
but that shit
had to go, man.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.853
Oops.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.029
Louie.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.333
You're gonna thank
me someday.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.336
I gotta get the kids
to their mom's,

02:15.369 --> 02:18.206
so we're leaving
in a few minutes.

02:18.239 --> 02:25.246
Are you mad that
I threw away your house?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.720
Okay.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.322
Look, we still gotta
get going, all right?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.624
So girls, get your stuff
and say goodbye to Pamela.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.159
Pamela should come
with us.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.329
Yeah, you
can meet Mommy.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.131
Yeah, that's
a great idea.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.235
That's such a good idea,
you can meet Mommy.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.669
Okay, okay.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.871
Okay, "one smart
fellow, he felt smart."

02:50.904 --> 02:52.806
Okay, I can do
it, ready?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.141
"One smart fellow,
he felt smart."

02:54.174 --> 02:55.476
"One- One smart
fellow, he smelled-"

02:55.509 --> 02:56.677
No.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.146
"One smart fellow,
he felt smart."

02:59.179 --> 03:00.814
Oh, I did it, I
did it, I did it.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.882
You said
he smelled farts--

03:01.915 --> 03:03.150
One smart fellow,
he felt smart.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.252
He felt-

03:04.285 --> 03:06.186
(Jane)
He smelled farts.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.655
(Lilly)
That's not the
nice word to use.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.189
(Pamela)
One smart fellow, he--

03:09.223 --> 03:10.791
One fart--

03:12.293 --> 03:13.727
Hi.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.763
Hi.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.498
Hello, what did I miss?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.899
Nothing, nothing.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.701
This is Pam, Pamela.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.735
Oh, hi.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.770
(Louie)
This is Janet.
Hey.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.204
Hi, Janet.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.906
Hi, I've heard.
Nice to meet you.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.241
Thanks, come on in.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.242
Patrick.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.243
Hey.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.411
Hey, this is Pamela.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.579
This is Patrick.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.680
Hi, Patrick.
Pamela, nice to meet-

03:32.713 --> 03:35.783
Really nice to meet you.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.585
Likewise.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.633
Jesus Christ,
is it always like this?

03:52.666 --> 03:55.202
Pretty much.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.304
Go Lilly!

03:56.337 --> 03:59.340
Woo!

04:01.675 --> 04:02.810
Yes, it's all.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.578
Well, yeah.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.579
It's all-

04:05.613 --> 04:06.747
We're all-

04:06.780 --> 04:08.849
We're all parents,
so...

04:18.626 --> 04:19.960
Okay.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.962
I gotta ask you
a question.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.332
What?

04:24.365 --> 04:27.901
How is your
ex-wife black?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.003
What, I can't marry
a black woman?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.272
You can marry
a green elephant.

04:32.306 --> 04:35.008
The question is,
how the hell is she the mother

04:35.042 --> 04:38.612
of those almost translucent
white girls of yours?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.314
Oh, her mom is white.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.451
Oh, well, then, her mom must
have had those kids,

04:43.484 --> 04:45.853
because Janet
is not their mom.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.589
Yes-- Yes, she is.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.625
Did you see
them being born?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.627
Did you see those little
white babies come out

04:53.661 --> 04:55.929
of her juicy black pussy?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.931
Because I think
she stole them.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.700
Or something happened.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.804
Oh.

05:03.837 --> 05:07.508
Oh, he's all
serious now.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.843
Aww...

05:09.877 --> 05:10.978
Come here.
Where?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.346
Come here.
Where?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.615
Lay down-- lay down.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.950
What are you doing--
what are you doing?

05:16.984 --> 05:20.688
We're gonna do it now
on the empty room floor.

05:20.721 --> 05:24.425
And then we're gonna get
you some furniture.

05:27.395 --> 05:33.567
**

05:42.342 --> 05:43.343
I didn't know.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.344
Oh, God.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.345
What am I
supposed to do?

05:45.379 --> 05:46.346
Shh!

05:46.380 --> 05:47.515
Sorry.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.850
Just look around and
see what you like.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.351
Look at this.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.887
This is gorgeous.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.490
It's kind of big and--

05:56.524 --> 05:58.392
No, it's-- It's nice.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.369
These are kind
of nice.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.838
What if I had
those two?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.740
(Pamela)
Those are like,
gynecological.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.508
Look at this.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.944
I'm gonna touch this
just because I shouldn't.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.546
What is this?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.380
Which one?

06:20.414 --> 06:22.950
Get those off your
face right now.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.700
Look at that,
look at that.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.868
(Louie)
What?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.403
That mirror,
that old mirror clock.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.973
(Man)
It's 19th century
French.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.477
That is frickin' so cool.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.478
I hate that.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.680
I hate that.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.562
I wanna get
that for her.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.563
Okay.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.564
How much--
How much is it?

07:10.598 --> 07:13.133
495.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.434
Okay, I don't
want to get it.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.569
Sorry.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.570
You don't wanna
get it?

07:16.604 --> 07:17.571
No, thank you, though.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.639
Okay.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
This is gonna be a lot
of fun at some point.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.512
We have some very talented
people at the show.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.013
This is weird
because you've never-

07:26.046 --> 07:27.848
I've never- You've never
seen me do this before.

07:27.881 --> 07:28.849
What?

07:28.882 --> 07:29.983
You're fine.

07:30.017 --> 07:30.984
Come here.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.120
What,
do I have something?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.488
No.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.190
I just think
you like this.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.760
And outerwear.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.161
And now, ladies
and gentlemen,

07:41.194 --> 07:45.799
please welcome to
the stage, Mr. Louis C.K.

07:46.967 --> 07:52.039
(light applause)

07:52.072 --> 07:55.442
(Louie)
Uh, hi, everybody,
how are you doing?

07:55.475 --> 07:59.713
I saw a dog and he had a
sweater on and on the side

07:59.747 --> 08:01.549
of his sweater, it said,

08:01.582 --> 08:04.718
"Please don't pet me,
I'm working."

08:04.752 --> 08:09.757
And I thought,
there's no way he wrote that.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.627
There's no way.

08:13.661 --> 08:17.430
Somebody walked up and wrote
some shit on his sweater.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.008
What's wrong with you?

08:28.041 --> 08:31.011
You didn't laugh--
You didn't laugh one time.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.212
That's because
you were staring at me.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.714
It made me nervous.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.215
How am I supposed to
laugh when the funny guy

08:35.248 --> 08:37.718
is staring right at me?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.687
I was trying to check
if you're laughing.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.024
So this is what you
guys do, like,

08:44.057 --> 08:46.894
just hang out
here after the shows?

08:46.927 --> 08:51.064
Yeah, do a set, have some
falafel, go home.

08:51.098 --> 08:55.903
So what's the suicide
rate for comedians?

08:55.936 --> 09:00.674
Like 76% per capita,
around there?

09:00.708 --> 09:05.178
Actually, clinical depression
is a big problem
amongst comedians.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.648
Most of it is caused
by Louie's act.

09:08.716 --> 09:13.253
And his face!

09:13.286 --> 09:15.122
What's up, fellas?
Hey, Marc.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.123
What's going on?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.524
Uh, my show got
picked up.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.525
What?
Yes.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.526
That's great.
Yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.028
That's amazing.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.295
Full season, full season.
Kid's gonna be famous.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.530
That's really great, man.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.564
His own show.
Thanks, man.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.534
What?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.036
You're not happy for me?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.705
Yeah, sure I am.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.774
Wow.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.645
That is
disappointing, man.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.047
I mean...

09:40.080 --> 09:41.749
I'm not gonna let it take
away from how good I feel,

09:41.782 --> 09:43.050
but you are--

09:43.083 --> 09:45.819
You are certainly not adding
anything, either.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.655
Look, Marc, I'm
happy for you.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.056
That's not-- If you're not
picking up on that,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.491
then I'm sorry.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.961
Oh, wow.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.963
That's really
nice, Lou.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.231
That is the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.100
Thank you so much.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.835
Do you remember--

10:01.869 --> 10:04.604
Do you remember that we were
best friends back when we were

10:04.638 --> 10:05.806
coming up together?

10:05.839 --> 10:06.907
Do you remember that?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.575
I was washing dishes.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.111
You were working at some,
like, phone line or something?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.813
And we--

10:12.846 --> 10:15.849
We were doing comedy and we
sucked at it, but we loved it,

10:15.883 --> 10:17.651
and we were there
for each other.

10:17.685 --> 10:18.819
Do you remember that?

10:18.852 --> 10:21.621
Yeah, I remember.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.990
Look.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.591
You know, I know that--

10:24.624 --> 10:25.859
You know, I'm just
gonna say it.

10:25.893 --> 10:29.162
You know, things are
going pretty well for me.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.131
Last couple years
have been great.

10:31.164 --> 10:35.168
And now you don't talk to me.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.204
You think
that's easy for me?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.639
I mean, I went
through a divorce.

10:39.673 --> 10:43.877
One of my cats
is probably dead.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.014
I could've used a friend, man.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.817
And I'm not sure I wouldn't be
acting the same as you

10:49.850 --> 10:52.352
if I were
in your position,
I'm not saying that.

10:52.385 --> 10:56.824
What I am saying is,
you've been a shitty friend.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.258
And it hurt me.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.870
Why don't you two get
a room already?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.922
It's like the
worst night ever.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.858
Why?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.727
'Cause that cute guy got his
own sexy show instead of you?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.197
No, you
know what?

11:37.230 --> 11:39.699
'Cause he's right,
I'm a bad friend.
What?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.068
I'm a shitty,
bad friend.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.770
You're not a bad
friend, that's bullshit.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.938
I'm a bad guy,
I'm a bad friend.
No.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.373
The reason-- I wasn't
there for him.
No.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.942
What?
I'm a bad friend.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.677
You're not
a bad friend.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.845
You're not
a bad friend.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.847
It's just--

11:53.881 --> 11:56.750
You can't handle his success
because you're not happy with

11:56.784 --> 11:57.751
you own life.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.053
You're not satisfied.

12:00.087 --> 12:05.258
You're anxious
and you're hungry and you know,
I mean, it's like,

12:05.292 --> 12:08.095
it's show business,
it's a tough racket.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.429
What does that guy want?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.866
Flowers from poor people
the second he gets rich?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.068
Screw that guy,
I hated him.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.037
But I don't like being--

12:17.070 --> 12:19.206
I don't like the feeling that
I'm jealous, I don't like the

12:19.239 --> 12:21.741
idea that I'm
a jealous person.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.210
So do something
about it.
I don't want to look at my--

12:23.243 --> 12:24.211
I don't want to be
one of those--

12:24.244 --> 12:25.913
What? Do what?

12:25.946 --> 12:29.716
Just go get on TV, go get
a show and be a star.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.118
It's that simple,
right?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.385
Yes, it is exactly
that simple.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.721
No, it-- Okay,
I'll go get a TV show.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.989
Yes.
Okay?

12:36.023 --> 12:38.425
Look, that guy
is not special.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.261
He used to wash
dishes, okay?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.898
And he's some nebbish
southwest Jew, you're a--

12:44.932 --> 12:47.134
I-don't-know-what
from wherever,

12:47.167 --> 12:50.070
none of you guys
are special or magical,

12:50.103 --> 12:54.741
some of you are luckier
and some of you work harder
than others.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.811
You're just guys.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.913
So you have
to decide.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.316
You just gotta decide
to go on TV, get a show,

13:03.350 --> 13:06.286
be a star and then you and your
friend can go lick each other's

13:06.319 --> 13:09.489
balls and leave
everybody alone already.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.163
Oh, that's the face.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.865
Don't make
the face!

13:17.898 --> 13:20.200
Don't make the face!

13:20.233 --> 13:22.002
Oh, God.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.336
Okay.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.838
All right,
big guy.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.809
All right, that's nice.

13:39.219 --> 13:43.356
Um, you want a plate
of jelly with a spoon?

13:43.390 --> 13:48.461
Is that what your
kind eat?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.198
People?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.966
Should we have
some Bulleit?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.834
Yes.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.369
Let's have
some Bulleit.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.028
What?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.531
I love you.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.066
Yeah?

14:26.099 --> 14:29.502
Yeah,
I love you.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.104
Okay.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.105
That's...

14:32.139 --> 14:33.340
I--

14:33.373 --> 14:35.508
Pamela.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.077
I love you.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.513
Yes, I heard,
I heard it.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.950
So say something.

14:42.983 --> 14:47.087
I love you.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.189
I...

14:49.222 --> 14:53.860
Something people.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.029
Pamela.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.630
Pamela.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.199
Stop, stop.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.200
Stop?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.401
Yeah, stop--

15:01.434 --> 15:05.638
Trying to have sex
with me to avoid me.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.075
Oh, my God,
what do you want?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.812
I want what couples say.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.083
I want you to say things to
me, like that you love me

15:16.116 --> 15:17.617
and you're my girlfriend

15:17.650 --> 15:23.223
and I want you to kiss me
and put your face on mine

15:23.256 --> 15:25.325
and stare at me.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.260
Ew.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.895
See, you can't do it.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
No, I don't want
to do it.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.165
Why?

15:32.199 --> 15:35.135
Because it's gross
and disgusting.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.269
Feelings are?

15:36.303 --> 15:37.437
Yes.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.072
Yes.

15:39.106 --> 15:43.676
Feelings are gross and boring
and rude and too private

15:43.710 --> 15:47.180
and yuck!

15:47.214 --> 15:49.016
Do you hear
yourself right now?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.917
Yes, I hear myself
perfectly well.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.019
Wait, hang on.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.953
Testing.
One, two?

15:53.987 --> 15:55.288
Am I coming in clear?
Am I coming--

15:55.322 --> 15:57.490
Yes, all good here.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.326
You're an asshole,
you're an asshole.
Can you hear you right now?

15:59.359 --> 16:00.327
You're an asshole.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.329
I'm-- What?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.198
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.466
I don't like you right now.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.201
I don't like
you right now.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.345
Oh.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.379
No.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.055
Women.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.965
(cell phone buzzing)

16:38.998 --> 16:40.333
Hello?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.135
(Pamela)
It's Pamela.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.004
Yeah, I know, stupid, everybody
knows who everybody is now,

16:45.038 --> 16:46.073
'cause it's--

16:46.106 --> 16:47.207
(Pamela)
Hey!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.641
What?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.243
Come back here.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.512
Come back right now, okay?

16:55.115 --> 16:57.250
Okay. Okay, I'm coming.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.723
Hello?

17:07.094 --> 17:08.261
Pamela?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.536
Hello?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.139
(Pamela)
In here!

17:21.374 --> 17:22.342
(Louie)
Here?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.343
Are you in there?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.377
(Pamela)
Yes.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.413
Come in here, please.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.081
(Louie)
Okay.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.487
Hi.

17:36.623 --> 17:40.427
Hi.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.062
Remember?

17:43.096 --> 17:46.032
Yeah.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.301
Take your clothes
off and get in.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.510
Come on.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.332
What's wrong?

18:19.366 --> 18:20.767
I--

18:20.800 --> 18:22.335
I just--

18:22.369 --> 18:23.670
You don't wanna
take your shirt off?

18:23.703 --> 18:26.406
Well, I never did
yet with you.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.674
I've never--

18:27.707 --> 18:29.442
You've never seen me
with my shirt off.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.679
I very strategically always had
it on whenever we did anything

18:32.712 --> 18:34.147
and I...

18:34.181 --> 18:36.849
Louie, that's your body.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.787
Don't be ashamed, you should be
proud, Papa, you're a big bear.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.822
You're awesome.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.691
Come on,
off with the shirt.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.864
Okay.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.205
Oh, no!

18:59.706 --> 19:02.342
Oh, forget it.
Forget it.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.178
I am kidding,
I'm kidding, seriously.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.613
I'm kidding, Louie.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.281
Seriously.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.782
I want you
to get in.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.184
You're turning me on.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.387
I'm totally wet
right now.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.289
Okay,
I see where this is going,
forget the whole thing.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.690
No, no, no, no!

19:17.724 --> 19:19.192
I'm just playing,
I'm just playing.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.727
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
please.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.695
Please, Louie.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.865
Please, I want you to
get into this tub with me.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.708
Okay, now, really get in
or put some pants on,
'cause holy shit.

19:35.742 --> 19:40.513
Yeah, okay, let's go.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.714
Oh, God.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.217
Okay.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.921
My God!

19:48.955 --> 19:50.257
Oh, no!

19:50.290 --> 19:51.524
No, no!

19:51.558 --> 19:54.527
Oh, my God!

19:54.561 --> 19:56.195
Oh! Oops.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.530
I'm sorry.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.531
It's okay.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.532
I'm sorry!

19:59.566 --> 20:00.600
It's okay.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.701
It's okay.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.735
I mean, come on.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.404
It's okay.

20:04.437 --> 20:08.375
There's nothing left.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.743
Doesn't this
feel nice?

20:10.777 --> 20:13.513
Yeah.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.349
Come here, turn around.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.551
Okay.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.524
Oh, Jesus.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.225
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.529
Okay.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.530
Good?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.565
Yeah.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.536
Okay.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.407
So, tell
me something.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.543
What?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.879
Well, you like saying things

20:46.913 --> 20:51.684
and talking about
romantic feelings.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.290
So...

20:57.324 --> 21:00.259
Tell me about kissing.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.562
Tell me about
your first kiss.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.830
My first kiss?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.299
Like, the first time
I ever kissed a girl?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.501
Sure.

21:08.535 --> 21:12.572
Okay, well,
her name was Laurie.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.607
I was in eighth grade
and she was--

21:14.641 --> 21:18.978
She was like an
upper-echelon social girl.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.848
Like, I was not
in her world.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.751
And one day, I'm at my locker,
and she walked right up to me

21:24.784 --> 21:26.686
and she goes--

21:26.719 --> 21:28.855
She said, "Plant one
right here, big guy."

21:28.888 --> 21:29.956
Ooh.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.591
And I didn't know
what to say.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.661
And then she kissed me
right on the mouth.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.597
And then she walks
away over to her friends.

21:37.630 --> 21:42.001
And they all start
laughing and she goes, "bleh!"

21:42.034 --> 21:44.003
It was a dare.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.838
Aw, Louie!

21:45.872 --> 21:49.008
No, I don't care,
I got to kiss Laurie Presser.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.845
I mean, I wish they dared her
to suck my dick, I don't care.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.314
I got to kiss her.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.485
I don't need a
person to like it.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.789
Tell me about you, tell
me about your first kiss.

22:02.822 --> 22:08.361
Well, I was supposed to kiss
this kid Jeff Choadler, because

22:08.395 --> 22:10.363
this girl Dina who told
everybody their business

22:10.397 --> 22:11.731
all the time said,

22:11.764 --> 22:15.868
"You're gonna kiss
Jeff at the dance."

22:15.902 --> 22:20.473
And then later, I'm in the
cafeteria and this boy I like,

22:20.507 --> 22:21.874
Mark, said,

22:21.908 --> 22:24.010
"Hey, I hear you're
gonna kiss Choadler."

22:24.043 --> 22:26.879
And I said,
"Don't talk about me."

22:26.913 --> 22:29.015
And he
laughed in my face.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.018
So I took all the
food that was on my tray

22:32.051 --> 22:34.521
and I shoved it
in his face

22:34.554 --> 22:37.023
and then he hit the ground
and I just started pummeling
him

22:37.056 --> 22:38.525
and his girlfriend came over

22:38.558 --> 22:40.427
and she ripped out
a chunk of my hair

22:40.460 --> 22:42.028
and the principal
walked me home.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.596
It was gnarly.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.702
That's your first kiss?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.103
Yeah.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.547
Listen.

23:00.580 --> 23:06.786
I know you want me
to say things

23:06.819 --> 23:09.856
and act a way.

23:09.889 --> 23:16.463
And it's not that
I don't feel certain...

23:16.496 --> 23:19.699
Ugh.

23:19.732 --> 23:25.404
Look, I want to do what you
want, but I just can't.

23:25.438 --> 23:31.177
There's some
things I just can't do.

23:34.481 --> 23:40.620
So...is it okay...
that we're here?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.722
I want to be here.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.824
We're in a tub.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.994
We like each other.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.797
Can this just
be okay?

23:56.135 --> 24:03.175
**
