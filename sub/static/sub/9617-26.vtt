00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:08.476 --> 00:10.309
Boo, this class.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.677
Do you even know
which one it is?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.512
I'm gonna need
a clue.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.280
Doo dah, doo,

00:15.282 --> 00:18.617
Dah, doo doo dah
da-da-dah da-da dah!

00:18.619 --> 00:20.285
Science.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.154
Morning, farkle.
What's new?

00:22.156 --> 00:23.956
I'm reading this great book
on anti-gravity.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.124
I can't put it down.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.859
-Ha!
-Ha!

00:26.861 --> 00:28.961
I hate this class.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.133
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:34.135 --> 00:36.502
I invite you
to join me

00:36.504 --> 00:38.504
On a journey
of discovery.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.806
-Your midterm experiment.
-(students groan)

00:40.808 --> 00:42.541
Yay!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.877
Do I look
sleepy to you?

00:44.879 --> 00:49.048
In front of you, each team
will find a beaker of
a clear, liquid solution.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.750
Oh boy, he's like
a sleep machine.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.920
And next to that--
and here's where
it gets exciting--

00:54.922 --> 00:56.321
A mystery marble!

00:56.323 --> 00:57.723
Good night!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.427
Right after school,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.128
Precisely at 3:15,

01:03.130 --> 01:05.831
One member of each team
will drop the marble

01:05.833 --> 01:07.499
Into the beaker.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.102
The elements in the marble
will break down over night

01:10.104 --> 01:11.670
And turn into sludge.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.705
Then, the other team member

01:13.707 --> 01:15.841
Will discover
what that sludge is

01:15.843 --> 01:19.011
And what it takes to turn
the beaker back to clear.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.212
Who's supposed
to do what?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.081
Well, that's up to you.
You're a team.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.583
Divide the responsibilities
as you see fit.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.253
I've been conducting
this experiment
for 35 years.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.922
I've kept
thorough notes.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.623
Very few
have cracked it.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.892
Well, you could add my name
to your journal right now, sir.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.227
I hope so, farkle.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.762
Let the games begin!

01:37.932 --> 01:39.965
Okay...
You get that?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.034
I have to
do something?

01:42.036 --> 01:44.903
All you have to do
is come in this afternoon
and drop a marble.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.805
I have to
drop a marble?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.740
I will pick it up
and hand it to you.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.042
I have to
take it from you?

01:50.044 --> 01:51.210
That's it.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.312
Well, how's my hand
supposed to get to the beaker?

01:53.314 --> 01:54.880
You know what?
Let's just move the beaker

01:54.882 --> 01:56.215
To the very edge
of the desk,

01:56.217 --> 01:57.883
So you don't even
have to lean forward.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.585
I have to put this
in that?

01:59.587 --> 02:02.454
-That's it.
-(whining) it's too much.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.624
Okay, riley,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.626
You drop the marble,
I'll figure out the sludge,

02:07.628 --> 02:09.294
And earn us
yet another "a."

02:09.296 --> 02:11.130
Okay. That's all
I have to do?

02:11.132 --> 02:12.898
Well, I am the scientist
around here.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.834
-Farkle, I don't understand
why I can't--
-you do want an "a," don't you?

02:21.408 --> 02:22.941
I don't like this.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.243
I don't like this either.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.744
Something's wrong.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.412
Why do we have to
drop the marble

02:27.414 --> 02:29.114
While farkle and lucas
do the science?

02:29.116 --> 02:31.717
Why is school over
and I don't got
a chimichanga?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.653
Maya, something's wrong.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.155
I feel like there's
a real problem here,

02:36.157 --> 02:37.823
But I just can't see
what it is yet.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.463
Now I see it.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.532
I see nothing unusual.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.866
Social injustice.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.601
Drop your marble and go.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.370
If you drop
these marbles,

02:51.372 --> 02:53.939
You are buying into
a system where the women, what?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.007
Buy shoes?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.441
While the men
learn the science.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.377
Shoes. Let's go.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.012
The system works.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.315
No!

03:05.119 --> 03:08.720
Maya, I am very disappointed
in our sisters.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.622
They don't believe we can do
what the boys can do.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.025
Chi. Mi. Chan. Ga.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.131
You are not going to
drop your marble.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.465
Oh, I'm gonna
drop my marble,

03:20.467 --> 03:22.968
But to make you feel better,
I'm gonna drop it like a dude.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.337
Maya, huh, takes
the inbounds pass.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.705
She dribbles
down the court.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.040
Three seconds left
on the clock.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.675
Her opponent's
a tall, useless goose.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.310
Maya fakes left,
turns right--

03:31.312 --> 03:32.844
Just stop! Tell me
which way you're going!

03:32.846 --> 03:34.146
She shoots...

03:34.148 --> 03:37.216
Scores!
Nothing but beaker!

03:38.919 --> 03:40.219
Your turn, goose.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.718
Dah da-da,
dah da-da,

04:46.720 --> 04:47.986
Dah da-da dah dah...

04:49.723 --> 04:50.989
Ah--

04:54.261 --> 04:56.328
What happened?
I don't get it.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.397
Science is my
favorite time of day.
What happened?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.965
I'm gonna
retrace my steps.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.070
Doo dah,

05:05.072 --> 05:06.438
Doo dah,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.140
Doo dah, doo dah,

05:08.142 --> 05:09.441
Doo, doo dah,

05:09.443 --> 05:10.575
Doo dah...

05:10.577 --> 05:11.610
Ah--

05:11.612 --> 05:13.612
Oh.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.213
That's the reason
right there.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.418
Riley (high pitched):
It all started with eve.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.353
Women have been treated
as second-class citizens
ever since.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.121
Thank goodness for strong women
like queen elizabeth,

05:23.123 --> 05:25.157
(normal voice)
then susan b. Anthony
helped get women the vote,

05:25.159 --> 05:27.259
And then betty friedan
wrote <i> the feminine mystique,</i>

05:27.261 --> 05:29.761
And then riley matthews
refused to drop the marble,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
And then here we are.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.098
You had
one job to do.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.334
You mean, take care
of the babies, farkle.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.436
What?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.271
How long
have I been out?

05:39.273 --> 05:41.139
I'm taking a stand.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.441
How could you
let her do this?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.376
She's on a mission, farkle.
Have you met her?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.945
Riley, you don't actually think
farkle had you drop the marble

05:46.947 --> 05:48.313
Because you're a girl,
do you?

05:48.315 --> 05:49.681
We were all girls, lucas.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.950
Every single set of
lab partners sent the girl.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.952
Yes. That's interesting,
isn't it?

05:53.954 --> 05:54.953
What is that?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.488
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a redo.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.989
She failed.
I didn't fail.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.292
I want a redo!
I want a redo, man!

06:00.294 --> 06:03.195
No redo.
Equal responsibility.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.496
One shared grade.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.798
That's right.
We should be equal.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.201
Why do you guys think
we're the ones who should
drop the marble

06:09.203 --> 06:10.669
While you figure out
the science.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.071
Hey, it's not like you guys
begged us to do it.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.539
Did you wanna do
the science?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.741
I was okay
with you doing it.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.076
Sarah, how is that
going to help us.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.312
How are we going to
become scientists

06:20.314 --> 06:21.546
If we don't learn
this stuff?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.081
So, I won't be
a scientist.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.249
Why not?

06:24.251 --> 06:26.551
Nobody wants to be
the first girl on mars?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.856
Represent, brenda!

06:30.858 --> 06:33.158
But one's not enough.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.993
Bay window.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.895
Bay window, all of you!

06:40.434 --> 06:41.833
Tell 'em, mommy!
Get 'em!

06:41.835 --> 06:44.569
Tell them they're a disgrace
to our entire whatever.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.172
Welcome to our home.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.341
No nice.
Go for the kill.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.943
Unfortunately, riley,
this is a serious problem.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.679
The girls your age start to
drift away from stem subjects--

06:54.681 --> 06:56.248
Science, technology,
engineering, math.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.518
The research shows that
we tend to play the roles
we think we're supposed to.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.187
-Hey, I'm me.
-Yes, you are,
you amazon warrior.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.922
Have I told you
how fond I am of you?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.624
-Tell me.
-I am.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.759
She dropped
her marble.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.194
-Maya!
-What?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.263
I'm not trying to hurt
the girl thing. I'm just lazy.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.632
You can't be lazy.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.966
And you cannot think
that it is

07:14.968 --> 07:17.702
More important to be liked
than it is to be leaders.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.471
Topanga:
Don't talk yourself
out of pursuing something

07:19.473 --> 07:21.540
Because you're afraid of
how it's going to make you look.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.376
What you need to know is
don't let anybody get in the way

07:24.378 --> 07:26.545
Of pursuing your growth
and your curiosity,

07:26.547 --> 07:27.779
No matter what
you want to do.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.582
I wanna be the best I can,
and I want everybody
to like me,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.651
And I dropped the marble,
and I want your shoes.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.622
I wanna work at the company
that makes your shoes.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.226
I wanna run the company
that makes your shoes.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.294
Yes.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.897
Well, if we want it all,
then we can't let other people
do the work for us.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.399
-Then I'm out.
-You're in.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.301
I'm in. It's not gonna
take long, is it?

07:49.303 --> 07:50.735
The rest of our lives.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.003
That's my girl.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.073
Why's it always gotta be
the rest of our lives?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.342
That's my other girl.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.652
Cory: Oh boy.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.988
Where are the boys?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.791
Boys! (chuckles)

08:12.793 --> 08:15.293
I'm very glad to see you,
because I thought there was
a distinct possibility

08:15.295 --> 08:18.330
You could be...
What's the word
I'm looking for?

08:18.332 --> 08:19.598
Dead.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.433
We didn't do anything,

08:21.435 --> 08:23.702
And we don't deserve
to be dead.

08:28.442 --> 08:31.209
Not understanding
the current climate
of the room,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.878
Zay chooses
to sit here.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.514
Men. Am I right?

08:35.516 --> 08:36.748
Get out!

08:37.718 --> 08:39.184
Now I get it.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.287
All right, does someone want to
explain to me how we got here?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.288
We were
in science class--

08:43.290 --> 08:44.956
-She will talk.
-I will listen.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.125
Cory:
Okay, guys, calm down.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.629
Now, today's lesson is about
the battle of panipat.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.831
There were three
battles of panipat.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.701
The first was called,
the first battle of panipat.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.970
You don't respect us.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.839
How can you
possibly think that?

09:00.841 --> 09:03.475
I call farkle minkus
to the stand.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.544
You can't put him
on trial, riley.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.913
Why not? Didn't he make
a judgment about me?

09:07.915 --> 09:09.881
We are
really unprepared.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.983
Yeah.
See ya, buddy.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.886
This isn't just about farkle.
This is about all of you.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.155
Yeah, lucas. Didn't you
tell me to drop the marble?

09:17.157 --> 09:18.890
Yeah, I wanted us to
do well on the midterm.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.326
Because you have no faith
in my scientific abilities.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.495
Because you fall asleep
in my hand.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.263
Yogi made me
drop the marble, too.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.431
I can't reach
the beaker.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.732
I could have
lifted you.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.200
I don't like that
as much as you think.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.235
(gasp)

09:30.237 --> 09:32.704
I'll tell ya
who didn't like something.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.006
Vikramajit,
the ruler of gwalior

09:35.008 --> 09:36.741
In the first battle of panipat.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.912
He died. Didn't like it.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.682
By relegating me to
a second-class marble dropper,

09:43.684 --> 09:46.084
You are stopping me
from realizing
my full potential.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.686
Riley, I'm just
better than you at this.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.054
Farkle, if you
were my friend,

09:49.056 --> 09:50.388
You would want me
to get better.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.756
I like science.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.191
Why don't you want me
to get better?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.460
I do.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.196
There's no situation where
I wouldn't want that for you.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.898
Riley, I've always been
your friend.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.066
I know.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.200
I'm sorry.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.569
Okay.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.937
I thought some of you just
didn't want anything to do
with science.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.240
Sarah, you just told me
you weren't interested.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.777
It's because I don't
stand up for myself!

10:12.779 --> 10:15.046
Well, I'm gonna
hate to see it
when you do.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.383
I wanna carry you around
like a doll whenever I want.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.085
Do it.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.387
A real friend doesn't let
another friend fail.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.623
Our failure
isn't your fault, riley.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.957
Our failure
is on me.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.859
I should have had
more faith in you.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.062
Speaking of failure,

10:31.064 --> 10:34.065
There will be
a quiz tomorrow on
the first battle of panipat.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.469
It's not gonna be
a good day.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.577
Are you proud of me,
mommy?

10:45.579 --> 10:47.479
So proud.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.448
They gave me
a trophy.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.317
Yeah. They did.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.055
Participant.

10:58.425 --> 11:02.827
Yeah. You were there.
You were-- you were
definitely there.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.698
Did you see when the ball
went right by me

11:06.700 --> 11:08.099
And then watched it
go into our goal,

11:08.101 --> 11:09.801
But I still had
a good attitude?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.136
Yeah.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.937
Did you see when the mom
from the other team

11:12.939 --> 11:14.606
Came over and thanked me
for having you?

11:18.545 --> 11:19.744
Mmm-hmm.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.184
She was nice.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.856
Yes, that's because her team
scored 29 goals.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.160
My coach said the score is
just a number that makes
one of the teams feel bad.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.261
You have a coach?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.631
The other team
were beasts.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.367
Did you see number ten?
Oh, number ten
wasn't even human.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.271
Sorry we destroyed you,
auggie.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.643
Hey, they gave him exactly
the same trophy as me.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.280
Topy,
I'm freaking, here.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.316
I feel ya, sister.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.919
You mean, you're
on my side about this?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.654
Let it fly, kid.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.423
All right, let me get in
my speech position.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.728
(loudly)
what kind of
country is this?

12:09.730 --> 12:12.497
Ugh! Ugh!

12:12.499 --> 12:14.232
I scored 29 goals,

12:14.234 --> 12:18.570
And your kid stood there
like a fire hydrant.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.706
And we both get
the same trophy?

12:21.708 --> 12:24.743
It's supposed to teach us
good manners and sportsmanship.

12:28.682 --> 12:30.915
Good game, auggie.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.754
I believe
you're insincere.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.191
You have to try!
Or how will you get better?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.360
Why should I?
They gave me a trophy anyway.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.461
Urrgh.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.398
Auggie doggie matthews,
you listen to me!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.534
Deep down inside
that fire hydrant

12:49.536 --> 12:52.070
Lives the spirit of
a shark and a lion

12:52.072 --> 12:54.706
Who had a baby
and named him number six.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.409
You were right
about her all along.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.111
I love you now, ava.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.046
Don't get
all mushy on me.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.214
Okay.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.217
Sorry, ava.
Your way sounds hard.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.119
It'd be easier just to
not play soccer anymore

13:08.121 --> 13:10.121
And find
something else.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.727
(growls)

13:15.729 --> 13:17.128
(squeals)

13:27.741 --> 13:30.158
Mud-like consistency,

13:30.159 --> 13:32.576
Copper color, no clear
separation of elements
at boiling point.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.746
No living organisms.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.815
Huh. Well,
my official conclusion

13:36.817 --> 13:38.483
After thorough research
and analysis,

13:38.485 --> 13:41.152
And try to stay with me now,
'cause this is very technical--

13:41.154 --> 13:43.154
-Yeah, how long you
gonna keep talking?
-Till the bell rings,

13:43.156 --> 13:44.756
'cause I don't know
what this stuff is.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.393
Yeah, uh, you know
what that is?

13:49.863 --> 13:52.463
How'd she get
her sludge to do that?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.599
Her sludge
is mad at us.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.601
Her sledge
is a girl.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.769
Something's wrong here.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.438
What's wrong here
is that you're a sexist pig.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.941
Why would you say that,
<i>mamacita</i> ?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.710
You really think
I couldn't do the science
because I'm a girl?

14:05.712 --> 14:08.947
Riley, marie curie was one of
the finest scientific minds
who ever lived.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.348
Science needs
the best minds it can get.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.616
What do I care
what body it's in?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.351
Well, what do you
think is wrong?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.386
Well, I took our sludge ball
home last night,

14:15.388 --> 14:16.554
And you know
what I found?

14:16.556 --> 14:17.789
It's a dirt ball,
riley.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.057
The sludge is...
Sludge.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.042
It's mud.
That's all it is.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.026
I don't understand why
this experiment's
such a big deal.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.198
I think I do.

14:28.802 --> 14:31.836
What if the experiment
isn't about the sludge at all?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.738
There's a lot of layers
to experiments, right?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.306
Well, there's what's going on
on the surface--

14:35.308 --> 14:37.375
And what's going on
that you don't see.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.377
So what's going on here?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.884
Bring me
the first sacrifice!

14:47.854 --> 14:50.889
Adooba hoo hoo!
Adooba hoo hoo!

14:50.891 --> 14:52.657
Girls (chanting):
Adooba hoo hoo!
Adooba hoo hoo!

14:52.659 --> 14:54.325
Adooba hoo hoo!
Adooba hoo hoo!

14:54.327 --> 14:55.860
Hoo!

14:55.862 --> 14:57.996
Farkle, this isn't
the experiment.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.664
-It isn't?
-No, that is.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.901
-Mr. Norton.
-Riley, farkle.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.536
We have
a new hypothesis.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.170
There's more to this
experiment than you've
been telling us.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.006
Interesting. Riley,
care to elaborate?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.241
Yes, but first,
I have to go save a life.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.177
Maya, you don't have
to sacrifice yogi.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.245
We found a solution.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.580
Tell me
after we sacrifice yogi.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.182
(chanting)
goodbye yogi! Goodbye yogi!
Goodbye yogi!

15:18.184 --> 15:19.884
Maya, why do we have
to sacrifice yogi?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.519
-Do you got a chimichanga?
-No.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.887
Then cover the boy
in cheese.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.856
(chanting)
cheesy yogi! Cheesy yogi!
Cheesy yogi!

15:24.858 --> 15:26.925
Ladies, your volcano
looks angry.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.227
Whuh-oh.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.461
Goggles on!

15:31.398 --> 15:32.764
(yelps)

15:37.437 --> 15:40.872
And dive under your desks.
Did I not mention that?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.647
Yeah, I should've
mentioned that.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.290
I like
blowing stuff up.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.725
It's not about that.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.726
What's it about?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.995
This is all about us
and the boys.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.597
Who we are now,
and who we want to be.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.900
Everything's their fault.
Stupid boys.

16:08.902 --> 16:10.168
Everything would
have been fine

16:10.170 --> 16:11.602
If I could've just
sacrificed yogi.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.738
Stupid yogi.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.007
Well, you can't.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.476
Maya, our guy friends
are pretty great.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.911
Riley: Pfft.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.312
Maybe it used to be
easier to see that

16:21.314 --> 16:23.748
Before we looked at each other
as boys and girls.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.584
Maybe it was easier
when we looked at each other
as friends.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.786
-Riley.
-Maya.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.022
If I can't blow stuff up
or sacrifice yogi,

16:31.024 --> 16:33.925
Then I just don't care
about being good in science.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.293
Well, you have to.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.761
We all have to.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.963
The stuff we're learning now,
science and math,

16:38.965 --> 16:40.331
It matters that we know
what they are.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.800
We can't let
other people think

16:42.802 --> 16:44.335
We'd rather have it
easy for us.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.672
N-- no, I want things
to be easy for me.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.440
No, you don't.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.708
Because then
you won't know anything,

16:50.710 --> 16:52.176
And you won't have
as many choices later.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.478
You think I could be
a scientist?

16:53.480 --> 16:56.881
I think if you were
a scientist,

16:56.883 --> 16:59.784
The world would be
a very dangerous place.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.453
Awesome.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.823
But if you don't believe
you could become a scientist,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.625
Then it's
even more dangerous.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.227
(thud)

17:09.229 --> 17:11.129
(thud)

17:11.131 --> 17:12.897
Come on.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.367
Goal!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.307
Yay!

17:23.309 --> 17:26.244
I want him on
my team next year.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.312
Aug, I'm
very proud of you.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.982
Me too. I've never seen
your uniform dirty.

17:30.984 --> 17:33.151
Yeah, every time
I missed a shot,

17:33.153 --> 17:34.986
Ava pushed me
in the mud.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.487
How'd you get
so dirty?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.222
Every time he made a shot,
I hugged him.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.690
Topanga:
Aww.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.592
And I like seeing you
like this.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.861
It means you got knocked down,
and you got back up.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.763
It means you're
in the game.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.266
It makes me very happy
to see you this dirty.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.572
I don't wanna know.
Get outta here.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.345
Still working
on that?

18:01.347 --> 18:03.514
We're never gonna figure out
what this stuff is.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.916
It might as well
just be dirt.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.785
Yeah. You know what?
It doesn't matter what it is.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.687
Hey, you might've
failed this experiment,

18:09.689 --> 18:10.888
But we don't want to.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.191
I'm not gonna fail it.
My partner's got this.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.225
Hi, guys.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.094
Oh, you're
talking to us?

18:16.096 --> 18:18.262
She is.
I go where she goes.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.531
You tell them yet,
farkle?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.433
Nope. This is
your marble to drop.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.941
Yeah, I was waiting for you,
partner.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.278
Did you just pat
for me to sit down?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.080
No.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.782
No no no no.
I was just

18:37.784 --> 18:39.984
Patting for a better place
for me to sit.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.227
Yah.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.963
They're all here.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.399
Aw, they came to
cook us up in these
little beakers

18:55.401 --> 18:57.668
And eat us
and talk about us,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.737
And I don't like
being talked about.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.406
We don't either,

19:02.408 --> 19:04.408
But we're gonna be
the best thing we can be

19:04.410 --> 19:05.977
No matter what
anybody says.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.112
That's right, sarah.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.248
This is an experiment
none of us should fail.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.517
And it's one of
the most important ones
we'll ever do.

19:13.753 --> 19:18.456
(sigh) well, we seem to have
settled back into our
original positions.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.491
Riley, farkle,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.693
I believe just before
things exploded,

19:22.695 --> 19:24.662
You were about to
present some findings?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.366
In middle school,
girls tend to drift away
from science.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.800
Isn't that right,
mr. Norton?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.937
It's been happening
so many years,
I started to keep a record.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.805
Not many figure out
my experiment,

19:34.807 --> 19:37.875
But those that do have always
benefited from the lesson.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.345
We let what happened in here
come between us.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.780
It's sludge,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.016
And it muddies up what
we think about each other.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.051
All of us have
unlimited potential.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.321
Farkle and me, well...

19:50.323 --> 19:51.622
Our beaker is clear.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.124
Because riley
didn't drop the marble.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.492
Why not, riley?

19:54.494 --> 19:58.296
I felt like if I did,
I would lose a part of me
that was valuable.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.564
I like science,

19:59.566 --> 20:01.032
And I like
figuring stuff out.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.169
For 35 years, I've been
running this experiment.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.638
Every year,
the vast majority of girls

20:07.640 --> 20:10.508
Agree to drop the marble
without even thinking about it.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.211
The boys do
the science.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.746
Unfortunate, but true.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.650
This is the age the girls
begin to lose interest
and that is a bad result.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.919
So the real experiment
is us.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.254
It is, maya.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.822
Don't lose interest.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.457
Wide awake, sir.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.427
All right. Everyone
lift up your beakers.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.431
Now look through them.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.199
I can't see you.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.401
Yeah. All this stuff
is in the way.

20:38.504 --> 20:42.373
It is beneficial
for young men and women
to realize right now

20:42.375 --> 20:45.276
The value of
working together as equals

20:45.278 --> 20:47.044
In all things,

20:47.046 --> 20:50.014
Because when you do,
the results are...

20:50.016 --> 20:51.682
Clear.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.751
Nice job, partner.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.354
Partner.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.861
So, did you do
the marble thing again?

21:03.863 --> 21:07.198
Yeah. You do the make history
like their lives thing again?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.232
It's all I got.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.602
You also got yourself
quite a daughter.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.903
Thank you.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.373
-Hi, daddy.
-Norton.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.441
Girls.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.443
To what do we owe
this unexpected pleasure?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.746
We thought we'd keep you
company on your walk home.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.048
That's very nice of you.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.816
Are you out of pizza money?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.451
No we're paying
for you this time.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.753
You too, mr. Norton.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.554
Really? Thanks.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.157
Wait, wait, wait.
Since when do you two pay?

21:33.159 --> 21:34.892
Since men and women
are equal.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.560
We're big-time
feminists now.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.062
Good for you.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.430
Where'd you learn that?

21:39.432 --> 21:40.898
Science class.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.333
Of course.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.969
Yeah. This school
is pretty messed up.
