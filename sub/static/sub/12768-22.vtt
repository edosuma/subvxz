VIOLET, SHE THREW
A COFFEE CUP AT MY HEAD.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.625

01:54.667 --> 01:56.625

SHE'S GOT ANGER ISSUES.

ARE YOU STILL, UH,
NOT TALKING TO ME?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.583

WITH CHARLOTTE LAST NIGHT.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.583
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE JUST DINNER,

02:20.625 --> 02:24.542
BUT IT BECAME DINNER WITH SEX.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.542

UM...

02:49.000 --> 02:51.125
(laughs) YEAH.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.208
SHE'S HAPPY.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.041
YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

02:56.083 --> 02:57.583
NO, I MEAN, REALLY HAPPY.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.917
IRWIN THINKS
I HAVE DEMENTIA.
SWEETIE,
I DON'T THINK THAT.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.083
IT'S JUST, YOU'RE USUALLY
NOT A HAPPY PERSON,

03:02.125 --> 03:03.709
AND YOU CHANGED,
JUST OVERNIGHT.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.208
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
OH, JUST SAY IT, IRWIN.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.667
COME ON, SAY IT.
I WAS A BITCH. (laughs)

03:08.709 --> 03:10.041
RIGHT, DR. TURNER?

03:10.083 --> 03:12.125
IT'S OKAY.
I WAS A HUGE BITCH.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.875
(laughs) RIGHT?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.959
BUT I AM NOT ANYMORE.
I'M FEELING BETTER.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.792

03:18.834 --> 03:20.458
THAT'S--THAT'S WONDERFUL.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.458
SHE GAVE AWAY
ALL OF OUR MONEY...
UH-HUH.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.458
TO A CHURCH.
DIDN'T NEED IT.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.458
AND NOW SHE'S--WELL, WE'RE
HAVING A LOT OF SEX NOW.
YOU THINK HE'D BE THRILLED.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.333
I AM, I AM. I...
IT'S NOT HER.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.959
YOU KNOW MY WIFE.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.959

03:42.083 --> 03:44.000
GOD.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.625
I HAVE FOUND GOD.

03:45.667 --> 03:50.041

BY THE HAND OF GOD.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.667
(elevator bell dings)

03:57.709 --> 04:00.000
STOP STARING AT ME

04:00.041 --> 04:01.375
(chuckles) I'M FINE.

04:01.417 --> 04:04.000
I JUST--I JUST WISH
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO STUBBORN.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.792
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEED TO BE RESTING.
I'LL REST LATER.

04:06.834 --> 04:08.166

04:08.208 --> 04:10.166

HOW YOU FEELING?

04:10.208 --> 04:13.291
OH, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M GLAD TO BE HOME.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.333
UH... IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

04:15.375 --> 04:17.959
I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO
IN MY OFFICE.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.875
OKAY.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.542
THE FLIGHT FROM SWITZERLAND
REALLY TOOK

04:25.583 --> 04:27.709
A LOT OUT OF HIM.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.250
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

04:30.291 --> 04:32.875
UH, I'M CONSULTING WITH
SOME A-LIST SPECIALISTS,

04:32.917 --> 04:35.291
SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT WE CAN TRY.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.041
HE HAS TO KEEP FIGHTING.

04:37.083 --> 04:40.458
I CAN'T LET HIM GIVE UP,
NOT NOW.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.041
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
WHAT ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS?

04:44.083 --> 04:48.083
I THINK
HE'S COME BACK TO DIE.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.083

over p.a.)

04:50.125 --> 04:52.041

THANK YOU. HELLO.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.041
HI, I'M GEORGE WALTERS.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER KIM.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.542
HI, KIM. THE E.R. DOCTOR

04:58.583 --> 05:00.542
SAYS YOU'RE HAVING
A LOT OF BACK PAIN.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.542
IT STARTED
A FEW DAYS AGO.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.875
IT SAYS HERE
YOU'RE AT 30 WEEKS.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.125
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
ANY PRENATAL CARE?
WE LIVE ON A FARM.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.875
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US
TO GET INTO THE CITY.
OKAY.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.041
UH, WELL, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK HERE.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.250
(ultrasound whooshing)

05:14.291 --> 05:17.458
IS MY BABY OKAY?
SHE'S THE APPROPRIATE SIZE
FOR HER DATES.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.041
SHE?

05:19.083 --> 05:20.709
IT'S A GIRL?

05:20.750 --> 05:22.500
OH, Y-YES.
I'M SORRY. I--

05:22.542 --> 05:26.500
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD
MAKE IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.709
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
MY DAUGHTER HOME.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.709
OKAY.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.083
WEIRD HOW?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.709
I DON'T KNOW. JUST WEIRD.
YOU'LL SEE.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.333
HI, I'M DR. BENNETT.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.959
I'M A CARDIOTHORACIC
SPECIALIST.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.333
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU
ABOUT YOUR SCANS.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.208
UH, IF YOU'D LIKE, YOUR FATHER
CAN WAIT IN THE LOUNGE.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.000
I'M FINE HERE.
OKAY. WELL...

05:47.041 --> 05:49.000
UH, WHAT YOU HAVE
IS AN AORTIC ANEURYSM.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.375
UH, IT'S AN ABNORMAL WIDENING

05:51.417 --> 05:53.834
OF THE LARGE ARTERY
IN YOUR ABDOMEN.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.041
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO DO SURGERY.
WE'RE HOPING TO AVOID IT
UNTIL THE BABY'S FURTHER ALONG,

05:57.083 --> 06:00.041
BUT WE WILL NEED TO KEEP YOU
HERE UNDER OBSERVATION.

06:00.083 --> 06:03.041
HOW LONG?
I DON'T KNOW. UH, WE'VE ORDERED
SOME REPEAT ULTRASOUNDS.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.041
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO REVIEW

06:05.083 --> 06:08.750
YOUR FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY--
MOTHER, FATHER, SIBLINGS.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.125
MY MOTHER'S DEAD.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.208
WHY DO YOU NEED ALL THAT?
IT'S STANDARD.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.959
A MEDICAL HISTORY HELPS POINT US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

06:15.000 --> 06:16.959
WHEN WE'RE TRYING
TO EVALUATE A PROBLEM.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.750
YOU AND I CAN TALK FURTHER

06:18.792 --> 06:20.750
WHILE YOUR DAUGHTER'S
UNDERGOING THE TEST.

06:20.792 --> 06:24.208
NO, I'M GOING WITH HER.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.041
(clears throat)

06:30.041 --> 06:34.166
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU,
IT'S NOT POLITE TO STARE?

06:34.208 --> 06:35.291
GABRIEL...

06:35.333 --> 06:38.375
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
WITH THE WAY WE LEFT THINGS.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.041
(wheelchair motor whirs)

06:40.083 --> 06:41.583
BUT WILLIAM NEEDED ME.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.041
HEY. I GET IT.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.417
ANY WOMAN IN YOUR POSITION
WOULD'VE MADE THE SAME CHOICE.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.041
IN THIS CORNER--

06:47.083 --> 06:49.041
ANGRY, SARCASTIC GUY
IN A WHEELCHAIR,

06:49.083 --> 06:51.041
WHO,
OBVIOUSLY A DYNAMO IN BED,

06:51.083 --> 06:53.041
CAN'T EXACTLY
SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.041
AND IN THIS CORNER,
YOU GOT OLD MONEYBAGS,

06:55.083 --> 06:57.166
WHO, IF YOU MARRY REAL QUICK,
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY,

06:57.208 --> 06:59.166
YOU'D MAKE FOR
AN EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE,

06:59.208 --> 07:02.625
NOT TO MENTION
WEALTHY WIDOW.

07:05.583 --> 07:08.667
I WANT YOU TO TRY
THE A.L.S. PROTOCOL ON WILLIAM.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.041
THE ONE THAT STILL NEEDS
F.D.A. APPROVAL?

07:11.083 --> 07:14.125
THE ONE THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY
DELEGITIMIZED IF WE USE IT?

07:14.166 --> 07:16.917
YES. WILL YOU DO IT?

07:16.959 --> 07:18.917
WOW. AMAZING.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.083
LITTLE MISS MORAL COMPASS

07:21.125 --> 07:24.083
IS SUDDENLY WILLING TO BLOW OFF
EVERYTHING SHE BELIEVES IN.

07:24.125 --> 07:28.041
GABRIEL... I'M ASKING YOU
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041
OKAY?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.834
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.834
(scoffs)

07:33.875 --> 07:35.583
HEY.

07:35.625 --> 07:39.041
SO, UH, BASED ON KIM'S
REPEAT SCAN,

07:39.083 --> 07:41.041
I RECOMMEND SURGERY NOW.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.041
OH, BUT THE FETUS
IS ONLY 30 WEEKS.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.583
IT'S TOO RISKY.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.792
YEAH, WELL, BLOWING
THE ANEURYSM COULD BE RISKIER.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.792
KIM TESTED POSITIVE
FOR THE GENE

07:49.834 --> 07:51.917
ASSOCIATED
WITH FIBRILLIN DISEASE?
YEAH, IT EXPLAINS
THE ANEURYSM.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.917
BUT IT'S
AN AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISEASE.

07:53.959 --> 07:56.667
I MEAN, IT'S INHERITED FROM
THE FATHER. IS SHE ADOPTED?

07:56.709 --> 08:00.083
WELL, GEORGE NEVER MENTIONED IT
IN HIS FAMILY HISTORY.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.667
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE DISEASE.

08:01.709 --> 08:04.041
HE'S NOT HER FATHER.
HE CAN'T BE.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.792
WELL, THEN WHO IS HE?

08:07.750 --> 08:10.500
(scanner thumping)

08:10.542 --> 08:12.709
SHE SAYS SHE FEELS GOD,

08:12.750 --> 08:14.500
AND IT CHANGED HER.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.083
JUST LIKE THAT,
SHE CHANGED?

08:16.125 --> 08:17.709
JUST LIKE THAT.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.083
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.750
OF COURSE THEY DO.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.750
THEY MODIFY. THEY ADJUST.

08:22.792 --> 08:25.333
BUT UNDERNEATH,
WE ARE WHO WE ARE.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.375
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.709
I-I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.709
MY ENTIRE CAREER IS BASED ON

08:31.750 --> 08:33.750
HELPING PEOPLE
BECOME WHO THEY CAN BE.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.208
PEOPLE DO CHANGE.
I'VE SEEN IT.

08:36.250 --> 08:40.041
PEOPLE JUST GET BETTER
AT COVERING UP THEIR FLAWS.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.166
THERE.

08:41.208 --> 08:42.875
WHAT IS THAT?

08:42.917 --> 08:46.041
(beeping)
THAT... IS CLAIRE'S GOD.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.041
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE
YOUR OWN CEREAL DOWNSTAIRS?

08:57.083 --> 08:59.041
(mouth full)
NAOMI DOESN'T LET US

08:59.083 --> 09:02.250
BUY THE KIND
WITH MARSHMALLOWS IN IT.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.875
HEY. HOW DO YOU GET
SOMEONE TO TALK TO YOU

09:04.917 --> 09:06.333
THAT WON'T TALK TO YOU?

09:06.375 --> 09:08.959
(normal voice) CHARLOTTE?
UH, NO, NOT THIS TIME.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.834
ACTUALLY, WE'RE DOING OKAY.
IT'S VIOLET.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.125
SHE'S BEING...
I DON'T KNOW, MEAN TO ME.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.166
SHE'S BEING MEAN TO ME,
AND SHE'S NEVER MEAN TO ME.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.041
AND I SAID I WAS SORRY.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.041
WELL, JUST, UH,
KEEP ON KEEPING ON.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.041
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

09:22.083 --> 09:25.291
'CAUSE I CAN GET THAT
FROM A BUMPER STICKER.
SHE'S HURT, COOPER.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.291
YOU CAN'T EXPECT HER
TO COME AROUND

09:27.333 --> 09:29.291
AS SOON
AS YOU APOLOGIZE TO HER.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.291
BECAUSE EVEN IF SHE UNDERSTANDS
YOUR EXPLANATION INTELLECTUALLY,

09:32.333 --> 09:35.041
SHE, UH, STILL HAS TO
ACCEPT IT... EMOTIONALLY.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.667
AND THAT TAKES TIME.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.583
SO KEEP ON KEEPIN' ON.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.375
EXACTLY.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.500
OKAY.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.041
HEY, UH, YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING PRETTY COOL,

09:46.083 --> 09:48.041
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYBODY ELSE?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.959
(lowered voice) I GOT INTO
U.C.L.A. MEDICAL SCHOOL.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.959
OH, MY GOD!
(normal voice)
OH, OH, OH, OKAY.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.041
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
CONGRATULATIONS.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.041
YEAH, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW I'D PAY FOR IT, BUT--

09:58.083 --> 10:00.333
HEY.
OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.542
I HOPE I DIDN'T MISS
ALL THE FUN.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.959
NO, WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED.
HEY, MOM.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.291
HEY. THANKS FOR
HAVING ME HERE, HON.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.041
WOW. THREE WEEKS TO GO.
YEAH.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.458
HEART RATE IS STRONG.
YEAH?

10:12.500 --> 10:15.125
YEAH.
OH, I REMEMBER
MY LAST MONTH WITH YOU.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.125
I WAS SO NERVOUS,
KEPT LOOKING UP

10:17.166 --> 10:19.125
EVERY POSSIBLE OBSTETRIC
COMPLICATION IN THE BOOK.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.583
I WAS DRIVING YOUR DAD CRAZY.
(laughs)
(chuckles)

10:21.625 --> 10:24.458
IT CAN BE A LITTLE SCARY,
YOU KNOW?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.542
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS?

10:26.583 --> 10:28.750
I'M FINE.
YOU HAVE A PLAN?

10:28.792 --> 10:31.041
I'VE GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT--
TOTALLY NATURAL BIRTH...

10:31.083 --> 10:33.041
DELL'S DOING
THE DELIVERY HERE.
UH-HUH.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.458
I DO MY SQUATTING EXERCISES
IN THE MORNING,

10:35.500 --> 10:37.667
MY RELAXATION TECHNIQUES
IN THE AFTERNOON.

10:37.709 --> 10:39.667
THAT'S SO I WON'T NEED
AN EPIDURAL.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.250
UM, MY BAG IS PACKED,

10:41.291 --> 10:44.250
AND DINK MADE A MIX CD
FOR MY BIRTHING MUSIC.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.041
I'M SO READY.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.667
(laughs) WOW.

10:47.709 --> 10:50.041
WOW. YOU'VE JUST--
YOU'VE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.041
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, MOM.

10:52.083 --> 10:55.041
YOU NOT BEING AROUND
ACTUALLY HELPED.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
IT GAVE ME A CHANCE
TO GROW UP,

10:57.083 --> 11:00.000
FIGURE THINGS OUT
ON MY OWN.

11:01.792 --> 11:04.208
THANKS FOR DOING
THE CONSULT, SHELDON.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.583
ORDINARILY, I'D ASK VIOLET,
BUT THINGS HAVE BEEN

11:06.625 --> 11:09.041
A LITTLE WEIRD
SINCE THE TRI--
(emergency bell rings)

11:09.083 --> 11:10.417
SHELDON?

11:10.458 --> 11:12.417
I KNOW, STOPPING ELEVATORS
IS YOUR THING,

11:12.458 --> 11:14.417
BUT TODAY, I... (laughs)

11:14.458 --> 11:16.834
I NEED TO CHANGE THINGS UP
A LITTLE.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.125
WAIT. YOU NEED HELP...
FROM ME?

11:19.166 --> 11:21.417
SHELDON, YOU SENT ME A BILL
LAST TIME.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.417
WHEN I ASKED FOR
ELEVATOR ADVICE, YOU CHARGED ME.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.625
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M GONNA SEND
YOU A BILL, AND I'M EXPENSIVE.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.208
I HAVE MANY
BOARD CERTIFICATIONS.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.208
ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
DO WHAT I DO.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.000
I CAN GIVE YOU A PAP SMEAR,
OPERATE ON YOUR UTERUS

11:34.041 --> 11:37.667
AND PERFORM SURGERY ON YOUR BABY
BEFORE AND AFTER HE'S BORN.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.041
ARE YOU GONNA LISTEN TO ME
OR NOT?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.417
ALL RIGHT. SPILL IT.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.041
IT'S ABOUT CHARLOTTE.
I'VE BEEN GIVING HER ADVICE

11:44.083 --> 11:47.667
ON HOW TO GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH COOPER, BUT THE THING IS,

11:47.709 --> 11:51.000
I THINK ABOUT HER, ADDISON.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.375
WHEN SHE'S NOT AROUND, I THINK
ABOUT THE WAY SHE SMILES,

11:53.417 --> 11:55.041
THE WAY SHE LOOKS AT ME.
I-I...

11:55.083 --> 11:58.041
MY GOD, I SPEND HALF MY DAY
COMING UP WITH LAME REASONS

11:58.083 --> 12:00.250
TO GO UP AND VISIT HER.

12:00.291 --> 12:03.208
D-DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE BORROWED STAMPS FROM HER?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.917
I DON'T EVEN USE STAMPS.
I PAY MY BILLS ELECTRONICALLY.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.625
LISTEN TO ME, SHELDON.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.625
YOU WANT HER? GO GET HER.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.625
YOU HAVE TO TRY.
IF NOT, YOU'RE GONNA SPEND

12:13.667 --> 12:16.166
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
KICKING YOURSELF

12:16.208 --> 12:20.208
AND WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T
MAN UP AND GO FOR IT.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.041
THANK YOU.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.083
(emergency bell rings,
motor starts)

12:25.125 --> 12:28.500
DO YOU HAVE
THE TEST RESULTS?

12:28.542 --> 12:31.500
CAN WE GO HOME NOW?
ACTUALLY, THE RESULTS
WERE INCONCLUSIVE.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.041
WE'RE GONNA NEED HER
FOR ONE MORE TEST.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.417
YOU CAN STAY HERE.
WHY? I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.750
WE NEED HER FOR RADIOLOGY,
SOME X-RAYS.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.750
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
IN THE ROOM.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.750
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
SHE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:43.792 --> 12:47.083
I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU HERE, KIM.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.750
APPRECIATE IT.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.750
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:50.792 --> 12:53.333
GOD IS IN A BRAIN TUMOR?

12:53.375 --> 12:54.458
(laughs)

12:54.500 --> 12:57.083
I'M SORRY.
THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.667
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
A WELL-KNOWN PHENOMENA.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.125
THE TEMPORAL LOBE

13:01.166 --> 13:03.834
CONTAINS THE EMOTIONAL ENGINE
OF OUR BRAINS.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.834
IT'S THE CENTER
OF ALL OF OUR FEELINGS.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.250
SO ANYTHING--RAGE, LUST,
ANGER, PASSION, BLISS--

13:08.291 --> 13:10.875
ANYTHING THAT STIMULATES
THAT PART OF THE BRAIN

13:10.917 --> 13:12.500
CAN ELICIT THOSE FEELINGS.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.750
BUT THEY'RE NOT REAL.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.750
THEY'RE JUST MISDIRECTED
NEURAL IMPULSES.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.125
THEY'RE...
RANDOM SHORT CIRCUITS.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.041
YOU'RE WRONG.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.041
THEY ARE REAL.

13:23.083 --> 13:26.709
I CAN FEEL IT.
IT'S HAPPINESS.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.041
I'VE NEVER FELT IT BEFORE,
BUT... (laughs)

13:29.083 --> 13:32.000
IT'S LIKE I-I HAD THIS GIANT
WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDERS

13:32.041 --> 13:34.041
AND--AND NOW
THE WEIGHT IS LIFTED.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
THAT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN,
THAT'S NOT JUST...

13:36.041 --> 13:37.792
CHEMICAL REACTIONS
IN MY BRAIN.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.291
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:39.333 --> 13:42.333
IF IT TAKES A MAGIC BULLET
IN MY HEAD TO DO GOD'S WORK,

13:42.375 --> 13:44.750
THEN THAT'S HIS PLAN.

13:46.667 --> 13:50.041
IT'S A SLOW-GROWING TUMOR.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.500
WITH SURGERY, YOUR CHANCE
OF RECOVERY IS EXCELLENT.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.000
BUT WITHOUT IT...

13:56.750 --> 14:00.417
WHAT, YOU'RE SAYING THIS TUMOR'S
GONNA KILL MY WIFE?

14:03.792 --> 14:06.000
WITHOUT THE SURGERY,
YOU WILL DIE.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.041
I SPENT THREE YEARS

14:13.083 --> 14:15.041
IN INTENSIVE THERAPY
WITH DR. TURNER,

14:15.083 --> 14:18.458
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
A HAPPY BONE IN MY BODY.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.667
NOW I'VE FOUND GOD.
HE'S IN ME.

14:22.709 --> 14:26.291
IF DYING IS GOD'S PLAN,
THEN SO BE IT.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.959
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO RADIOLOGY.
UH, WE ARE.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.959
I JUST WANTED YOU TO CONSULT
WITH ONE MORE DOCTOR, KIM,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.333
BEFORE WE DO YOUR TEST.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.250
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:39.291 --> 14:41.917
HI, KIM.
I'M DR. WALLACE.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.834
NOTHING?

14:46.875 --> 14:48.917
NOTHING? DID YOU--DID YOU
CHECK WITH N.I.H.?

14:48.959 --> 14:52.166
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I KNEW IT WAS A LONG SHOT.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.083
THANK YOU FOR TRYING,
DR. KLEIN.

14:54.125 --> 14:55.709
OKAY.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.208
(receiver clatters)

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO,
GABRIEL?

15:03.291 --> 15:06.417
DO I HAVE TO BEG?
OKAY, I WILL BEG.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.500
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
IS UNETHICAL AND ILLEGAL.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.208
THE PROTOCOL IS NOT APPROVED.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.291
IF I GIVE IT TO WILLIAM,
IT WILL NEVER BE.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.583
AND I AM STILL ASKING.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.041
NO.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.834
IF YOU DON'T HELP HIM,
HE IS GOING TO DIE.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.333
WELL, THEN I GUESS
HE'S GOING TO DIE.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.125
SHE'S RATIONAL AND ORIENTED.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.041
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF DELUSIONAL THINKING.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.917
SHE'S ENTIRELY CAPABLE

15:42.959 --> 15:45.917
OF MAKING DECISIONS
ABOUT HER OWN TREATMENT, SO--
SHE CAN'T DECIDE.

15:45.959 --> 15:48.500
SHE THINKS SHE HAS
A PERSONAL PIPELINE TO GOD.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.041
THIS WOMAN WAS MISERABLE
HER ENTIRE LIFE UNTIL NOW.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.041
AND YOU ARE TELLING HER
TO ACCEPT A TREATMENT

15:53.083 --> 15:55.041
THAT WOULD BRING
ALL THAT PAIN BACK,

15:55.083 --> 15:57.667
TO JUST LIVE WITH IT.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.917
I-I MAY NOT AGREE
WITH HER DECISION,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.959
BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
HER REFUSAL

16:02.000 --> 16:04.250
TO LET YOU DO THAT TO HER.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.291
WHY WOULD ANYONE CHOOSE
TO FEEL WORSE?

16:06.333 --> 16:09.458
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SURGERY,
SHE WILL DIE.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.041
AND CLAIRE UNDERSTANDS THAT.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.083
SHE BELIEVES
IT'S PART OF GOD'S PLAN.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.500
IF GOD
IS NOT GONNA DO HIS JOB,

16:16.542 --> 16:21.041
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DO IT
FOR HIM.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.000
SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER
YOUR MOTHER AT ALL?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.041
NO.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.041
WELL, HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN SHE DIED?

16:26.083 --> 16:28.834
I'M NOT SURE.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.750
YOU KEEP LOOKING AT THE DOOR.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.041
ARE YOU AFRAID
YOUR FATHER'S GONNA COME IN?

16:35.083 --> 16:37.458
OR HOPING HE'LL COME IN?

16:39.583 --> 16:41.542
DO YOU HAVE PLANS
FOR YOUR FUTURE?

16:41.583 --> 16:45.041
DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE OR...

16:45.083 --> 16:47.542
MY DAD DOESN'T THINK
I NEED IT.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.750
WELL, THE TWO OF YOU,
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.750
WE HAVE
A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.333
HOW SO?

16:58.375 --> 17:01.625
WHEN'S MY DAD GONNA BE BACK?

17:01.667 --> 17:04.667
SOON.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.583
KIM,
THIS ABNORMALITY YOU HAVE,

17:06.625 --> 17:09.166
IT'S A CONDITION
YOU INHERIT FROM A FATHER--

17:09.208 --> 17:12.166
ONLY FROM A FATHER--
AND GEORGE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.166
MY DAD SAYS
DOCTORS DON'T KNOW

17:14.208 --> 17:17.959
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
HALF THE TIME.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.458
WELL, YOUR FATHER...

17:19.500 --> 17:21.458
HE SEEMS TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.792
OF COURSE HE DOES.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.834
HE'S MY DAD.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.041
HER ANSWERS FELT REHEARSED,
YOU KNOW, AND PLANNED.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.000
AND SHE'S BEEN
EXTREMELY ISOLATED.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.000
SHE DOESN'T WATCH TV
OR USE THE INTERNET.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.875
SHE CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME SHE LEFT THE FARM.

17:37.917 --> 17:40.041
I THINK WE SHOULD CALL
THE POLICE.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.500
THE POLICE?
I'M NOT 100% SURE, BUT I THINK
WE MAY BE WITNESSING

17:42.542 --> 17:44.500
A KIDNAPPED GIRL
AND HER ABDUCTOR.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.458
(Addison) WHAT?

17:48.083 --> 17:50.208
WE'RE LEAVING.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.458
KIM, GET OUT OF BED.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.250
GET YOUR STUFF.
WE'RE GOING HOME.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.875
(Addison) NO, GEORGE.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
NO, GEORGE. WHOA.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.959
THIS IS MY FAMILY,
AND WE ARE LEAVING.
GEORGE. G-GEORGE.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.875
ALL RIGHT. NO. GEORGE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

18:03.917 --> 18:06.083
(Addison)
GET BACK INTO BED, KIM. KIM.
LET HIM GO!

18:06.125 --> 18:08.709
KIM!
YES, I NEED SECURITY.
3-0-1 EAST.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.917
YOU'RE HURTING MY FATHER.
I LOVE YOU.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.834
PLEASE.
YOU'RE GOING TO HURT HIM.
WE'RE FAMILY.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.250
YOU HAVE TO GET BACK INTO BED.
SAM! SAM, A LITTLE HELP HERE.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.041
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
(Sam) OKAY.

18:17.083 --> 18:21.667
SHE'S BOTTOMING OUT.
CALL THE O.R. WE GOT
A TRIPLE-A THAT'S BLEEDING OUT.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.458
OKAY. EASY.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.000
(footsteps approach)

18:29.709 --> 18:32.041
ARE WE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS?

18:32.083 --> 18:34.125
(exhales)

18:34.166 --> 18:36.083
HUH.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.875
I GUESS WE'RE NOT
GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

18:42.917 --> 18:45.917
(Sarah Jaffe's "Clementine"
playing)

18:49.333 --> 18:51.041
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

18:51.083 --> 18:55.375
NAOMI...
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

18:55.417 --> 18:58.959
WHATEVER TIME I HAVE LEFT,
I WANT TO SPEND IT WITH YOU...

18:59.000 --> 19:00.041
I...

19:00.083 --> 19:02.500
ENJOYING EACH OTHER...

19:02.542 --> 19:06.542
NOT CHASING
SOME IMPOSSIBLE CURE.

28:54.208 --> 28:56.041
YOU ARE SAFE HERE.

28:56.083 --> 28:57.792
NO.

28:57.834 --> 29:00.959
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.709
I NEED TO SEE HIM.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.625
I LOVE HIM.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.875
THE PROCEDURE WENT WELL.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.250
I'LL PROBABLY SEND CLAIRE HOME
IN A FEW DAYS.

29:14.291 --> 29:16.041
AND THE REST?
WE'LL SEE.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.083
(Claire) WHERE THE HELL
ARE THEY--THE DAMN DOCTORS?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.041
I AM TIRED OF WAITING.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.667
I'M SORRY.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.291
I CAN'T.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.083
CLAIRE.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.250
YOU LIED TO ME, YOU BITCH.

29:28.291 --> 29:32.667
YOU PUSHED ME TO DO THIS.
NOW I HAVE NOTHING. NOTHING!

29:32.709 --> 29:34.959
YOU SHOULDA
LET ME DIE HAPPY.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.750
(Addison) HE KIDNAPPED HER,
ASSAULTED HER

29:42.792 --> 29:44.750
AND KEPT HER
AWAY FROM HER REAL FAMILY,

29:44.792 --> 29:46.750
AND SHE STILL
WANTS TO SEE HIM?

29:46.792 --> 29:49.750
THE POLICE SAID GEORGE
HELD HER CAPTIVE FOR 15 YEARS.

29:49.792 --> 29:51.792
HE'S BEEN THE ONLY PERSON
IN HER LIFE,

29:51.834 --> 29:53.792
PUTTING CLOTHES ON HER BACK
AND FEEDING HER

29:53.834 --> 29:55.792
AND MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS
IN HER LIFE.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.792
TO HER,
HE IS HER REAL FAMILY.

29:57.834 --> 29:59.792
IT'S THE ONLY LOVE
SHE KNOWS.

29:59.834 --> 30:02.500
OH, IT'S JUST TOO PERVERSE
TO COMPREHEND.

30:02.542 --> 30:05.041
WELL, ALL KIM SEES
IS THAT HE TOOK CARE OF HER,

30:05.083 --> 30:06.542
PROTECTED HER.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.542
HAVE THEY LOCATED HER FAMILY,
HER PARENTS?

30:08.583 --> 30:10.250
I MEAN,
MAYBE WHEN SHE SEES THEM--

30:10.291 --> 30:12.250
SHE'S BEEN TOTALLY
CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD.

30:12.291 --> 30:14.250
AND OVER TIME,
THAT OLD LOVE SHE KNEW

30:14.291 --> 30:16.041
BECAME VAGUE, FADED MEMORIES.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.041
AND EVENTUALLY,
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE,

30:18.083 --> 30:20.000
HIS BELIEFS BECOME HER BELIEF

30:20.041 --> 30:22.083
AND HIS REALITY
BECOMES HER REALITY.
