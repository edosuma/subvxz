00:10.020 --> 00:12.660
- Agnes,
cancel my appointments.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.660
- What appointments?

00:14.660 --> 00:16.700
- Wishful thinking.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.380
- It's called
alternative energy,

00:19.380 --> 00:21.700
the key
to a brighter tomorrow.

00:21.700 --> 00:28.260
[car engine turns]

00:28.260 --> 00:30.940
Notice all the animals
wearing sunglasses.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.860
- Because
it's a brighter tomorrow.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.260
- Yeah.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.100
- My boys are
in elementary school.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.980
They don't make nearly
as many dioramas as we do.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.980
- The whole environmental club
is making them for green week.

00:40.980 --> 00:43.380
And this afternoon
in the cafeteria,

00:43.380 --> 00:44.900
we're having
a bio-diorama-rama.

00:44.900 --> 00:50.060
I heard one kid made a diorama
about a world without dioramas.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.300
- It's still cool if I sleep
at your place tonight, right?

00:52.300 --> 00:53.980
- Totally. Hey, since
we're both done with classes,

00:53.980 --> 00:56.420
we can start the sleepover now.
- Let's get in our pajamas

00:56.420 --> 00:58.340
and build a blanket Fort.
- Let's do it.

00:58.340 --> 01:00.140
- A blanket Fort.
Wow!

01:00.140 --> 01:01.940
- You can come hang out in it
with us later if you want.

01:01.940 --> 01:03.820
- Uh, thanks,
but I think I'll find something

01:03.820 --> 01:06.380
more grown-up to do.
- Hmm. Okay.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.940
<i>- Enjoy eating Fiber
and watching the mentalist.</i>

01:08.940 --> 01:10.740
Shirley:
Britta, that wasn't nice.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.700
- I'm sorry, Shirley,
but who wants to hang out

01:12.700 --> 01:15.780
in a blanket Fort with grown men
in tiny underoos?

01:15.780 --> 01:17.940
- Hello!
So...Jeffrey,

01:17.940 --> 01:20.740
I was just looking over
your class schedule.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.220
- Why?
- Uh...

01:22.220 --> 01:23.860
maybe it was
a random spot-check.

01:23.860 --> 01:26.060
Maybe it was
a specific spot-check.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.380
Maybe I'm making
a scrapbook.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.020
The point is

01:30.020 --> 01:32.940
you will not be receiving credit
for your independent STUDY:

01:32.940 --> 01:36.020
<i>Conspiracy theories
in U.S. History.</i>

01:36.020 --> 01:37.860
- What? Why not?

01:37.860 --> 01:39.140
- Because the class
doesn't exist.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.860
And neither does the teacher--
professor professorson?

01:42.860 --> 01:44.340
- What? That's his name!

01:44.340 --> 01:45.860
- Oh...
- it's dutch.

01:45.860 --> 01:48.980
I think it means professor.
- I think it means poppycock.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.660
- The ultimate Jeff Winger
blow-off CLASS:

01:51.660 --> 01:53.620
The one that doesn't exist.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.620
- Now I have to audit an entire
system for shenanigans,

01:56.620 --> 01:58.620
which means...
Bye-Bye weekends.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.340
Bye-Bye writing at starbucks

02:00.340 --> 02:03.740
till a certain persian barista
asks me about my novel.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.420
- God, Jeff!

02:05.420 --> 02:07.140
It's one thing to blow off
regular classes,

02:07.140 --> 02:09.660
but this devalues all the
credits I work very hard for.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.020
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I defend myself

02:11.020 --> 02:12.660
and say this is nuts?

02:12.660 --> 02:14.260
I've been meeting
with this professor

02:14.260 --> 02:16.820
in his office
every wednesday all semester.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.660
- Professor professorson.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.940
- Yes!
- Really?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.540
You're gonna commit to this?

02:21.540 --> 02:23.140
- Commit to what--reality?

02:23.140 --> 02:24.380
- Okay, then, please...
lead me

02:24.380 --> 02:27.260
to professor professorson.
- Gladly.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.260
- This I gotta see.
- I have always dreamt

02:29.260 --> 02:31.020
of playing charades with you,
Jeffrey--

02:31.020 --> 02:33.660
just not like this,
not on dry land.

02:33.660 --> 02:37.620
- ♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

02:37.620 --> 02:41.060
♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

02:41.060 --> 02:43.860
♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪

02:43.860 --> 02:48.060
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:48.060 --> 02:53.300

03:02.620 --> 03:04.540
- ah!
Oh ho.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.900
Oh, man!

03:06.900 --> 03:08.900
Ahh...
- ahh.

03:08.900 --> 03:17.860
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.020
- You thinking
what I'm thinking?

03:20.020 --> 03:21.580
- We're too big for this,
aren't we?

03:21.580 --> 03:23.100
- Yeah.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.220
But if we went two pillows
higher in the corner,

03:25.220 --> 03:26.900
we could vault the ceiling...

03:26.900 --> 03:28.180
Bump up the square footage.

03:28.180 --> 03:31.100

03:38.700 --> 03:45.180
Professor Professorson's
Office.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.380
- Oh!

03:47.380 --> 03:50.380
Oh...

03:50.380 --> 03:52.300
- I don't know
what's goin' on.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.900
You guys have to believe me.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.900
I have spent a whole year
studying conspiracy theories

03:56.900 --> 03:58.940
with professor professorson
right here!

03:58.940 --> 04:00.820
Wait! Of course!

04:00.820 --> 04:02.380
Conspiracy theories.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.060
This is a test.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.980
He's teaching me about
real conspiracies

04:06.980 --> 04:08.260
by erasing his existence!

04:08.260 --> 04:11.300
- Oh, my god.
Do you know what this means?

04:11.300 --> 04:14.580
That's how stupid Jeff thinks
other people are.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.100
- I always knew you were lazy,
but I didn't realize

04:17.100 --> 04:19.300
that you would stoop
to such pathetic lies!

04:19.300 --> 04:20.660
[door closes]

04:20.660 --> 04:22.980
- One man's lies
are another man's truth...

04:22.980 --> 04:24.620
wouldn't you say, Jeff?

04:24.620 --> 04:27.100
- I'm sorry.
And who are you?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.660
- I'm professor professorson.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.420
- Ha. Wow, you...you really
had me going there

04:32.420 --> 04:33.980
for a second, professor.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.300
I thought I was going insane.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.700
- Precisely.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.980
An actual conspiracy
to round out your education

04:39.980 --> 04:42.900
in Conspiracies
and theories thereof.

04:42.900 --> 04:46.820
- Your real name...
is professor professorson?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.100
- My family name
is professorberg,

04:48.100 --> 04:50.860
but we changed it when we
were fleeing from the nazis.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.420
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.900
- You've probably
never heard of me

04:53.900 --> 04:55.340
since I primarily
teach night school.

04:55.340 --> 04:58.020
My faculty I.D.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.180

04:59.180 --> 05:01.260

late enough

05:01.260 --> 05:03.860
to meet you
night school professors.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.860
Thank you
for indulging me, Dean.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.300
Jeff, read chapters
10 through 12 of Douglas

05:12.300 --> 05:14.980
and see you next week.
[phone plays dramatic chords]

05:14.980 --> 05:17.060
That is...

05:17.060 --> 05:18.980
if I still exist.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.660
- [laughs]

05:20.660 --> 05:21.940
See you, professor.

05:21.940 --> 05:24.660
- Sorry to doubt you,
Jeffrey.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.580
More importantly,
out with this audit,

05:27.580 --> 05:30.060
<i>back to chapter one
of time desk:</i>

05:30.060 --> 05:34.060
<i>The chronicles
of Dean dangerous.</i>

05:34.060 --> 05:36.100
- That is gonna be
the worst book I'll ever read

05:36.100 --> 05:38.180
cover to cover.
- I'm a terrible friend.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.060
I accused you of being
a lying cheat.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.580
Can you ever forgive me?
- Sure.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.060
Here's the thing, though.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.660
I've never seen that guy
in my life!

05:47.660 --> 05:50.500
- What? That wasn't
professor professorson?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.940
- There is no
professor professorson!

05:51.940 --> 05:54.300
I made him up!
I forged a form

05:54.300 --> 05:56.940
with a phony teacher and class
for a free credit!

05:56.940 --> 05:58.660
- I knew it!

05:58.660 --> 05:59.660
Oh, you lying cheat!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.940
- Wait. Then--

06:01.940 --> 06:03.940
who was that?

06:03.940 --> 06:07.940
- I don't know!

06:07.940 --> 06:10.130
- Wait, what?
- I don't know!

06:12.660 --> 06:13.900
- What should we do?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.180
- I think we Should grab
some lunch.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.020
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.500
I just saw fat Neil
head to the cafeteria

06:18.500 --> 06:19.900
with that look in his eye.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.420
We got ten minutes
To grab the last Lima bean.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.700
- Jeff, you made up
a professor,

06:22.700 --> 06:24.060
and he just appeared
out of thin air.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.140
You're not the least bit curious
how that happened?

06:26.140 --> 06:27.660
- My latest theory?
Maybe I'm a god.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.940
I've denied the signs
for too long.

06:28.940 --> 06:29.980
- This is so typical.

06:29.980 --> 06:32.020
You're just gonna blow off
what happened.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.540
- Yes, especially when
not blowing it off

06:33.540 --> 06:34.740
might cost me
my free credit.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.980
Now, do me a favor.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.700
Be very un-Annie
and blow it off too.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.380
- Oh, sure.
I'll just blow it off.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.460
I'll just blow
everything off.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.700
Heck, I guess I'll just
blow off walkin'!

06:43.700 --> 06:46.020
- okay.
- I'll just blow off standing.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.060
I'm just blowin'
everything off!

06:49.060 --> 06:50.700
Maybe I'll blow off
talking language.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.980
- Okay.

- Blee Blu BLAH BLAH

07:04.140 --> 07:06.060

07:06.060 --> 07:07.780
Can I come inside?

07:07.780 --> 07:09.340
- [speaking foreign language]

07:09.340 --> 07:15.060
- [foreign language]

07:15.060 --> 07:16.260
- You could, pavel...

07:16.260 --> 07:19.460
or...maybe the inside
could come to you.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.860
- How would you characterize

07:20.860 --> 07:23.060
the amount of blankets
and pillows you have?

07:23.060 --> 07:25.060
- A Butt load?

07:25.060 --> 07:26.700
I get wicked cold, bros,

07:26.700 --> 07:36.980
and mad sleepy.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.060
- If you're here to help me
take my diorama

07:39.060 --> 07:41.980
to the bio-diorama-rama,
I can do it myself.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.460
- Yes. You made that clear

07:43.460 --> 07:46.060
in your 11th
"I can do it myself" text.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.860
You even work too hard
at passive-aggression,

07:47.860 --> 07:50.140
you know that?

07:50.140 --> 07:53.100
- Hey, so...

07:53.100 --> 07:55.260
do you know anything about
greendale's night school?

07:55.260 --> 07:57.060
- Yeah. I'm assuming
it's the worst thing

07:57.060 --> 07:59.100
you could ever
hope to be in...

07:59.100 --> 08:01.060
only at night.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.540
Damn it, Annie.
Have you been playing detective?

08:03.540 --> 08:06.060
You are gonna Nancy screw me
out of my credit.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.620
- Relax. All I did was ask
the administration desk

08:08.620 --> 08:10.420
if I could borrow
a faculty directory.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.020
[suspenseful music]

08:13.020 --> 08:15.260
Take a look at this.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.900
- Is that professorson?

08:16.900 --> 08:18.820
- His real name
is professor Woolley,

08:18.820 --> 08:21.020
and he actually does
teach night school here.

08:21.020 --> 08:22.860
Why would someone
you've never met

08:22.860 --> 08:24.860
pretend to be
your phony professor?

08:24.860 --> 08:27.140
He was already carrying
falsified faculty credentials.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.660
Do you know what this means?

08:28.660 --> 08:31.740
- Yes. You are making me do work
for my fake Conspiracy class!

08:31.740 --> 08:35.020
- Exactly.
There's a conspiracy here.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.780
A dark, vast conspiracy

08:36.780 --> 08:38.940
that may just go
all the way to the top.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.419
- This is greendale, Annie.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.900
If there's a conspiracy,

08:41.900 --> 08:44.059
it goes all the way
to slightly below the middle.

08:44.059 --> 08:45.620
- Wait a minute.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.140
Something's wrong.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.820
My car won't start.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.420
[cell phone rings]

Tell your little friend

08:53.220 --> 08:55.020
to stop snooping around
night school,

08:55.020 --> 09:02.260
otherwise, things might get...
explosive.

09:02.260 --> 09:06.220
- Annie!

09:06.220 --> 09:16.460
- Whoa!
