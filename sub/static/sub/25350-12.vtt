there's blood and guts
and pieces of flesh.

Now I know that
the land's been cursed.

31:27.319 --> 31:30.921

some kind of massacre.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.055
It's not a lot to go on,

31:32.057 --> 31:33.923
but massacre kind of
caught my attention.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.059
Now, this land was the site
of a bloody battle

31:36.061 --> 31:38.595
that took place during
the Revolutionary War.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.930
During that time,
this area

31:39.932 --> 31:42.799
was a Shawnee Indian village
known as Piqua.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.167
The Shawnee
saw white settlers

31:44.169 --> 31:46.002
as a threat to
their control of the land,

31:46.004 --> 31:49.072
so they traveled around
attacking the settlements.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.606
Now, by 1780,
the settlers

31:50.608 --> 31:52.342
and the colonial government
had enough,

31:52.344 --> 31:53.977
so a guy named
Colonel George Clark

31:53.979 --> 31:55.145
mobilized a group --

31:55.147 --> 31:58.748
over 1,000 revolutionaries
and militia.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.119
Clark's men stormed
the Shawnee village at Piqua.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.455
Even by conservative estimates,
the body count was big.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.424
Clark said he lost
at least 14 men,

32:07.426 --> 32:09.959
and the Shawnee lost
at least triple that.

32:09.961 --> 32:10.893
So we're looking at
a minimum

32:10.895 --> 32:13.930
of about 56 dead
right here in this area.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.699
Now, before Clark's men
left the area,

32:15.701 --> 32:18.034
they burnt
800 acres of crops,

32:18.036 --> 32:20.937
basically destroying all
the Shawnees' food supply...
Geez!

32:20.939 --> 32:22.506
...so they couldn't come
back here and live here.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.108
Then the Native Americans
put a curse

32:25.110 --> 32:29.446
because they kind of got
[bleep] every which way.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.048

affect these guys?

32:32.050 --> 32:36.252

into a conscious entity.

32:36.254 --> 32:40.323

a physical form.
