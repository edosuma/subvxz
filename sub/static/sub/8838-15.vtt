WEBVTT

01:24.544 --> 01:26.921
Mary: PA! PA!

01:27.088 --> 01:29.924
REVEREND SAYS
I'VE GOT A JOB,
A TEACHING JOB!

01:30.091 --> 01:34.554
AND MISS BEADLE SAYS
THAT MARY IS FAR AND AWAY
THE BEST QUALIFIED.

01:34.721 --> 01:35.889
THAT'S AWFUL NICE
OF MISS BEADLE.

01:36.055 --> 01:36.973
YOU BE SURE
TO THANK HER, MARY.

01:37.140 --> 01:37.974
I ALREADY DID.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.642
NOW, IT'S
A TWO-MONTH TERM.

01:39.809 --> 01:42.854
IT'S THE FIRST SCHOOL
THAT WILLOW PRAIRIE
HAS EVER HAD.

01:43.021 --> 01:45.273
THE SALARY
IS $15 A MONTH

01:45.440 --> 01:47.817
AND BOARD AND ROOM
IN A GOOD CHRISTIAN HOME.

01:47.984 --> 01:49.903
NOW, THE JOB IS MARY'S
IF SHE WANTS IT.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.404
OH, I DO.

01:51.571 --> 01:53.573
NOW, YOU'D BETTER
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING INTO FIRST.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.658
IT'S A SMALL,
ISOLATED COMMUNITY

01:55.825 --> 01:57.744
THAT'S 40 MILES
NORTH AND EAST.

01:57.911 --> 01:59.537
THERE'S NO STORE.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.706
THERE'S NO
POST OFFICE,

02:01.873 --> 02:05.460
AND, WELL, THE PEOPLE
ARE...

02:05.627 --> 02:07.253
WARY, STANDOFFISH.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.297
THEY JUST DON'T
MUCH LIKE STRANGERS.

02:09.464 --> 02:10.965
BUT YOU DO
PREACH THERE?

02:11.132 --> 02:12.592
YES, ONCE
EVERY OTHER MONTH

02:12.759 --> 02:15.303
SINCE THE CHURCH
WAS WILLED A FARM
UP THERE.

02:15.470 --> 02:17.680
NOW, IF YOU
TAKE THE JOB, MARY,

02:17.847 --> 02:19.766
YOU'LL BE
THE SECOND TEACHER.

02:19.933 --> 02:23.603
THE FIRST, MISS TIPTON,
SHE LEFT AFTER JUST 4 DAYS.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.355
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:25.522 --> 02:27.065
WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW,

02:27.232 --> 02:30.735
BUT I'D GUESS
THAT MISS RACHEL PEEL
HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.

02:30.902 --> 02:35.156
SHE, UH--SHE PRESIDES
OVER THE PRAYER MEETINGS.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.741
A LADY PREACHER?

02:36.908 --> 02:39.077
SHE'S A LADY
OF STRONG OPINIONS.

02:39.244 --> 02:41.621
SHE JUST DOESN'T
LIKE SCHOOL.

02:41.788 --> 02:43.665
SHE DOESN'T SEE
THE NEED OF THEM.

02:43.832 --> 02:45.792
TELL YOU, REVEREND,
THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING,

02:45.959 --> 02:48.253
YOU'RE MAKING THIS PLACE
SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE
A BATTLEGROUND.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.505
WELL, IT WAS UNTIL
I TALKED TO THE PARENTS

02:50.672 --> 02:53.967
AND I EXPLAINED
TO THEM THAT THE SCHOOL
IS A CHURCH PROJECT,

02:54.133 --> 02:55.844
AND THEY AGREED
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

02:56.010 --> 03:01.266
BUT NOW, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THE OPPOSITION
FROM MISS PEEL IS OVER.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.268
IT'S MARY'S DECISION.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.646
IT WOULD BE
A GOOD EXPERIENCE.

03:06.813 --> 03:10.817
IF I CAN TEACH THERE,
I EXPECT I CAN TEACH
JUST ABOUT ANYPLACE.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.822
MARY, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND, THEN.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.657
I HAVE.

03:17.824 --> 03:19.617
I'LL TAKE THE JOB.

03:19.784 --> 03:23.371
BLESS YOU. WE'LL LEAVE
FIRST LIGHT TOMORROW.

03:39.846 --> 03:43.516
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
I'LL GET YOUR THINGS.

03:43.683 --> 03:45.143
THANK YOU, REVEREND.

03:53.026 --> 03:55.945
CHILDREN,
THIS IS MISS INGALLS.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.822
SHE'S YOUR NEW TEACHER.

03:57.989 --> 03:59.699
HELLO.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.636
THEY'RE ALL SHY.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.722
AS SOON AS THEY KNOW YOU,
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.402
MARY, THIS IS
MR. CALEB FISHER.

04:36.569 --> 04:37.779
CALEB, MARY INGALLS.

04:37.946 --> 04:39.280
I'M PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.532
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
TO LET ME STAY IN YOUR HOME.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.284
IT'S NOT MY IDEA.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.827
CHURCH HOUSE,
CHURCH LAND.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.913
I'M JUST FARMING IT.

04:48.957 --> 04:51.751
I NEVER TOLD YOU
THEY WERE
VERY FRIENDLY.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.301
THIS WILL BE
YOUR DESK.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.512
IT ALSO SERVES
AS MY LECTERN
WHEN I PREACH HERE.

05:02.679 --> 05:04.347
THAT SHOULD
BRING ME LUCK.

05:04.514 --> 05:07.183
IT'S PAST 8:00.
WANT I SHOULD
RING THE BELL?

05:07.350 --> 05:09.477
THAT WOULD BE
VERY NICE.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.354
OH, CALEB, WOULD YOU
BE BACK AFTER SCHOOL

05:11.521 --> 05:13.106
TO SHOW MISS INGALLS
HOW TO FIND YOUR HOUSE?

05:13.272 --> 05:14.857
NO. GOT MY PLOWING
TO DO.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.609
Reverend:
THAT CREATES A PROBLEM.

05:16.776 --> 05:18.695
NOPE. KATIE
CAN SHOW HER.

05:18.861 --> 05:22.782
YOUR DAUGHTER.
OH, YES.

05:22.949 --> 05:24.033
NOW, IF I
CAN BE ANY HELP,

05:24.200 --> 05:25.451
I'LL BE HAPPY TO
SPEND THE DAY HERE.

05:25.618 --> 05:27.620
OH, NO, PLEASE DON'T.
I'LL DO JUST FINE.

05:27.787 --> 05:28.913
[BELL RINGING]

05:29.080 --> 05:32.583
WELL, GOOD LUCK,
TEACHER.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.535
[BELL RINGS]

06:07.702 --> 06:09.245
Caleb: THEY'RE

06:09.412 --> 06:11.539
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:15.168 --> 06:17.837
MY NAME IS MISS INGALLS.

06:18.004 --> 06:20.256
I'M YOUR TEACHER.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.926
WELL, HOW IS EVERYBODY
THIS MORNING?

06:27.889 --> 06:30.808
WELL, LET'S GET TO WORK.

06:32.185 --> 06:35.563
DID ANY OF YOU
BRING A SLATE?

06:35.730 --> 06:37.857
PAPER?

06:38.024 --> 06:39.984
A PENCIL?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.031
IF I WERE TO PASS OUT
PAPER AND PENCIL,

06:45.198 --> 06:47.200
UM, HOW MANY OF YOU
COULD WRITE YOUR NAMES?

06:47.366 --> 06:49.243
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

06:57.210 --> 07:00.671
I'D LIKE EACH ONE OF YOU
TO COME UP TO MY DESK,

07:00.838 --> 07:04.008
ONE AT A TIME--
GIRLS FIRST.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.718
YOU, IN THE FRONT ROW,

07:05.885 --> 07:08.054
COULD YOU COME
UP HERE, PLEASE?

07:13.392 --> 07:17.396

07:37.750 --> 07:40.753
AFTER SCHOOL,
YOU SHOW ME HOW
TO GET THERE, ALL RIGHT?

07:42.171 --> 07:43.798
ALL RIGHT.

07:43.965 --> 07:47.135
NOW,
THIS IS YOUR NAME.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.427
BETWEEN LESSONS,
YOU CAN PRACTICE

07:48.594 --> 07:49.929

OVER AND OVER.

07:50.096 --> 07:52.807
SOON YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO DO IT WITHOUT
EVEN LOOKING.

07:57.228 --> 07:59.063
ALL RIGHT,

08:06.195 --> 08:07.947

08:09.615 --> 08:11.576
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.327
WON'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR NAME?

08:13.494 --> 08:15.454
Woman, harshly:
SPEAK UP, CHILD!

08:19.959 --> 08:21.127
MISS PEEL?

08:21.294 --> 08:23.171
MISS RACHEL PEEL.

08:25.131 --> 08:27.049
I'M MISS INGALLS.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.636
THE NEW TEACHER.
I HEARD.

08:30.803 --> 08:32.471
HER NAME'S SARAH,

08:32.638 --> 08:36.809
DAUGHTER OF SAMUEL
AND ELIZABETH MILLER.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.397
Mary: THANK YOU.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.776
YOU MAY TAKE
YOUR SEAT, SARAH.

08:53.284 --> 08:56.996
UH...THANK YOU
FOR DROPPING IN.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.176
THOUGHT I'D SEE
FOR MYSELF.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.431
FANCY RAIMENT.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.938
AND BOOKS.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.023
I NEED THEM TO TEACH.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.983
TEACH WHAT?

09:26.150 --> 09:28.694
WRITING, SPELLING,
READING--

09:28.861 --> 09:30.696
CIPHERING?

09:30.863 --> 09:32.406
CIPHERING?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.450
OLD WAYS ARE BEST.

09:34.617 --> 09:38.663
CIPHERING
AND THE LORD'S WORD
IS ALL ANY MAN EVER NEEDS.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.498
WELL, IT'S A START, BUT--

09:40.665 --> 09:42.208
IF A MAN CAN CIPHER,

09:42.375 --> 09:44.460
HE CAN TRADE
IN THE MARKETPLACE--

09:44.627 --> 09:46.671
SELL HIS CROP
FOR A FAIR PRICE,

09:46.837 --> 09:48.673
BUY WHAT HE NEEDS,

09:48.839 --> 09:50.007
GET BACK
WHERE HE BELONGS--

09:50.174 --> 09:52.760
BACK HOME
IN THE BOSOM
OF HIS FAMILY,

09:52.927 --> 09:55.638
AWAY FROM SIN
AND TEMPTATION.

09:56.681 --> 10:01.269
WELL, YES, I WILL
TEACH ARITHMETIC...

10:01.435 --> 10:03.604

10:03.771 --> 10:06.649
AND ALSO
HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY.

10:18.077 --> 10:20.079
CIPHERING.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.540
THE REST IS SIN
AND A WASTE.

10:39.515 --> 10:43.436
Mary: HEY, KATIE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WAIT FOR ME!

10:43.602 --> 10:46.022
HEY, KATIE,
WAIT UP. PLEASE?

10:55.114 --> 10:56.782
OH, HELLO, MISS PEEL.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.285
BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

11:03.414 --> 11:06.250

11:45.456 --> 11:47.958
MY CALEB TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU.

11:50.127 --> 11:54.006
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY MIND IS.

11:54.173 --> 11:58.844
HE TOLD ME
YOU'D BE HERE--
4 FOR SUPPER.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.971
I JUST PLAIN FORGOT.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.307
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:03.474 --> 12:05.518
MAYBE NOT TO SOME.

12:05.684 --> 12:10.606
MY CALEB,
HE--HE DON'T HOLD
WITH FORGETTING.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.275
KATIE WILL SHOW YOU
WHERE YOU SLEEP.

12:41.429 --> 12:43.889
OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.100
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE TIDY.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.352
MA SAID.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.770
THERE, YOU SEE?

12:49.937 --> 12:52.314
YOU CAN TALK TO ME,
AND IT DIDN'T HURT A BIT.

12:57.445 --> 12:58.696
[DOOR OPENS]

12:58.863 --> 13:01.323
PA'S HOME.
WE'D BEST HURRY.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.909
I'LL BE ALONG
IN A MINUTE. I JUST WANT
TO WASH AND CHANGE.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.287
YOU'D BEST HURRY.

13:28.184 --> 13:30.186
Mary: I'M SORRY
I'M LATE.

13:33.564 --> 13:36.775
KATIE TOLD YOU
HOW MOTHER WAS
TAKING UP THE SUPPER.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.321
SHE SAID WE SHOULD HURRY,
BUT I WANTED TO WASH
AND CHANGE.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.450
THE OTHER DRESS
WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.330
THIS ONE IS--IS--

13:49.497 --> 13:52.583
WELL, I WOULD NOT
CALL IT A PROPER DRESS.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.590
MY SUNDAY DRESS?
THE ONE I WEAR TO CHURCH?

14:00.883 --> 14:03.761
NOT HERE.

14:03.928 --> 14:07.264
ENOUGH TALK. SIT.

14:21.654 --> 14:23.405
EAT.

14:41.674 --> 14:43.759
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S MY WORK.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.845
I WANT TO. AT HOME,
I ALWAYS DO DISHES.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.847
SUIT YOURSELF.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.766
YOU KNOW, WE HAD
A LOT OF THINGS WE DID

14:50.933 --> 14:52.768
TO MAKE
KITCHEN CHORES GO FASTER.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.396
AT ELECTION TIME,
PA READ TO US
OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER

TO DECIDE WHO WAS
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.153

THE FIDDLE TILL THE DISHES
IN THE CUPBOARDS DANCED.

I'D BE HAPPY--

NO FITTING DRESS

15:36.729 --> 15:38.981
TO BE TEACHING
OUR YOUNG ONES IN.

15:39.148 --> 15:41.567
YOU'D BEST WEAR
SOMETHING ELSE.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.013

SO SHE DONE IT.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.934
OH, KATIE.
YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

16:16.101 --> 16:19.605
SURE I DO. MISS PEEL,
SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.

16:31.867 --> 16:36.080
ALL RIGHT, HAZEL.
YOU NOW HAVE ONE APPLE.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.501
NOW HOW MANY

16:40.668 --> 16:41.919
TWO.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.922
VERY GOOD. YOU SEE?
YOU DID KNOW.

16:45.089 --> 16:46.465
ALL RIGHT.
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.468
I WANT ONE OF THE BOYS
TO DO THIS ONE.

16:49.635 --> 16:53.055
TWO PLUS TWO.
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

16:54.807 --> 16:57.142

17:17.913 --> 17:21.166

DIDN'T HEAR NOTHING
BUT APPLES.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.837
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TWO APPLES.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.214
A FRIEND
GIVES YOU TWO MORE.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.008
HOW MANY APPLES
DO YOU HAVE?

17:30.175 --> 17:33.303
I TOLD YOU. THREE.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.932
I ATE ONE.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.186
Mary: GO HOME.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.354
MY PA SAID--

17:42.521 --> 17:44.314
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR PA SAID!

17:44.481 --> 17:46.066
I SAID GO HOME
AND STAY HOME

17:46.233 --> 17:49.027
UNTIL YOU CAN BEHAVE
PROPERLY AND POLITELY
IN THIS CLASSROOM.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.612
- MA'AM, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING--
- LOOK!

17:50.779 --> 17:52.239
WE'RE NOT HERE
SO YOU CAN COME IN LATE

17:52.406 --> 17:53.824
AND MAKE SILLY JOKES.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.701
I'M HERE TO TEACH,
AND THESE CHILDREN
ARE HERE TO LEARN.

17:55.868 --> 17:59.288
YOU COME BACK WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO LEARN
AND NOT BEFORE.

18:00.748 --> 18:03.500
AND BE HERE
WHEN THE BELL RINGS
OR DON'T COME AT ALL!

18:03.667 --> 18:05.043
BUT, MA'AM,
MY PA SAID--

18:05.210 --> 18:06.462
YOU TELL YOUR PA
TO COME SEE ME.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.672
I'LL BE GLAD
TO TELL HIM WHY
I SENT YOU HOME.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.966
GO ON, NOW. GET!

18:20.309 --> 18:21.351
[EXHALES]

18:21.518 --> 18:22.728
ENOCH,
YOU HAVE TWO APPLES.

18:22.895 --> 18:25.564
I GIVE YOU TWO MORE.
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?

18:31.028 --> 18:33.989
Mrs. Fisher:
THIS HERE TELE--
TELE--

18:34.156 --> 18:35.365
TELEPHONE.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.034
THIS THING
IS ON THE WALL?

18:37.201 --> 18:38.786
OR A TABLE OR A DESK.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.205
WHY, HE COULD EVEN PUT ONE
IN THE BARN IF HE WANTED TO.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.499
'COURSE, COWS WOULDN'T
HAVE MUCH NEED.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.292
YOU TALK
INTO THIS THING,

18:45.459 --> 18:46.543
AND SOMEBODY
HEARS YOU?

18:46.710 --> 18:49.046
- MM-HMM.
- HOW FAR AWAY?

18:49.213 --> 18:52.257
NEXT DOOR
OR MILES AND MILES.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.927
BEFORE LONG, THERE'LL
BE THOUSANDS OF THEM.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.929
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE
TO TALK TO THEIR NEIGHBORS

18:57.095 --> 18:59.264
OR CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.309
AMERICA WILL
BE A LOT SMALLER,
THANKS TO MR. BELL.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.561
WHO?

19:04.728 --> 19:07.439
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL,
THE INVENTOR
OF THE TELEPHONE.

19:07.606 --> 19:10.609
YOU CAN PUT ONE
IN THE BARN.

19:10.776 --> 19:13.654
PEOPLE CAN TALK
ACROSS MILES.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.199
THAT IS A LIE.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.834
NO, SIR, IT IS NOT.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.129
THE TELEPHONE WAS EXHIBITED
AT THE PHILADELPHIA EXPOSITION.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.382
THERE WERE LOTS OF STORIES
IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.552
STORIES. LIES.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.804
GOOD THING I WAS WORKING
OUT IN THE MUD,

19:38.971 --> 19:40.931
HAD TO LEAVE MY BOOTS
ON THE PORCH,
OR I WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD

19:41.098 --> 19:43.267
ALL THIS STUFF
YOU'RE MAKING UP
IN YOUR HEAD.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.602
I DID NOT MAKE IT UP.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.067
ELLEN, I'M HUNGRY.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.654
IT'S READY.
I'LL TAKE IT UP.

20:02.119 --> 20:04.037
SO...

20:04.204 --> 20:08.166
YOU SENT JOSHUA BOND
HOME, EH?

20:08.333 --> 20:10.460
YES, SIR.

20:10.627 --> 20:14.006
WELL, HIS FATHER
DIDN'T LIKE IT.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.674
YOU DO IT AGAIN,

20:15.841 --> 20:18.886
HE'S GOING TO HAVE
A TALK WITH MISS PEEL.

20:19.052 --> 20:23.265
I TOLD JOSHUA I'D BE HAPPY
TO TALK TO HIS FATHER.

20:23.432 --> 20:26.894
IF HE CAN BEHAVE,
HE CAN ATTEND SCHOOL.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.814
IF HE DOESN'T,
I'LL SEND HIM HOME AGAIN!

20:34.902 --> 20:36.486
AND I DO NOT LIE.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.573
THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS A TELEPHONE.

21:14.399 --> 21:18.528
HERE YOU GO.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.072
IF YOU'D GIVE ME
MORE WARNING,

21:20.238 --> 21:22.991
I COULD HAVE PACKED
A BETTER LUNCH.

21:23.158 --> 21:24.409
IT AIN'T THE LUNCH.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.913
IT'S THE CORN PRICE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.749
HYAH! GET UP THERE!

21:41.718 --> 21:43.595
UH, THAT DRESS...

21:43.762 --> 21:45.806
CALEB DON'T THINK
IT'S PROPER FOR TEACHING.

21:45.973 --> 21:48.350
I KNOW, BUT
I HAPPEN TO LIKE IT.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.531
[CLUCKING]

22:06.952 --> 22:09.037
MISS INGALLS, NO!

22:09.204 --> 22:12.416
OH, HE CAN'T
HURT ANYBODY.
HE'S JUST A CHICKEN.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.418
HOW YOU DOING, THERE?
HUH?

22:19.423 --> 22:21.258
THERE YOU GO.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.556
KATIE?

22:27.723 --> 22:29.516
KATIE!

22:42.362 --> 22:43.780
Mary: REUBEN BRACKEN
IS ABSENT.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.323
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY?

22:45.490 --> 22:47.451
Child: WHOOPING.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.578
WHAT?

22:49.745 --> 22:52.205
Joshua:
HE'S WHOOPING.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.292
REUBEN'S GOT
WHOOPING COUGH.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.252
CAN I COME TO SCHOOL?

22:57.419 --> 23:00.172
YOU MAY,
IF YOU BEHAVE,

23:00.338 --> 23:02.883
FOR AS LONG
AS YOU BEHAVE.

23:03.050 --> 23:07.596
IF YOU GOT THE WHOOPERS,
SUGAR AND COAL OIL
IS THE ONLY CURE.

23:07.763 --> 23:13.769
IF YOU AIN'T GOT THEM,
WELL, THIS WILL
KEEP THEM AWAY.

23:15.687 --> 23:20.358
UH, THANK YOU, BUT
THE ODOR IS SO STRONG,

23:20.525 --> 23:22.694
I'M AFRAID IT WOULD
MAKE ME SICK TO WEAR IT.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.238
GOT TO BE STRONG,
OR IT DON'T DO NO GOOD.

23:25.405 --> 23:29.159
AND YOU ONLY SMELL IT
RIGHT AT FIRST.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.870
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU
JUST...

23:32.037 --> 23:33.538
PUT IT ON THE END
OF THE DESK OVER THERE,

23:33.705 --> 23:35.624
AND I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.417
AIN'T JUST WHOOPING COUGH.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.419
MISS PEEL SAYS
IF YOU WEAR IT
NEXT TO YOUR SKIN,

23:39.586 --> 23:42.506
YOU DON'T GET POX
OR MUMPS OR MEASLES.

23:42.672 --> 23:43.632
MISS PEEL?

23:43.799 --> 23:45.425
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT MAKES THEM.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.968
ONLIEST PEOPLE
GET SICK AROUND HERE

23:47.135 --> 23:49.721
ARE THEM THAT GIVE HER
CAUSE TO WANT THEM TO.

23:51.515 --> 23:54.976
YEAH. WELL, UH,
THANK YOU.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.436
NOW, IF YOU'LL
TAKE YOUR SEAT,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.980
WE'LL SEE
IF WE CAN GET SOME
SCHOOLWORK DONE.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.966
DID YOU TURN LOOSE
MY LITTLE ROOSTER?

24:26.133 --> 24:28.385
YOU MEAN THE ONE
THAT WAS TANGLED UP
IN THE STRING?

24:28.552 --> 24:30.804
OH...I TOLD YOU.

24:30.971 --> 24:33.306
IT HAD TO BE HER.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.393
WHAT ARE YOU?
SOME KIND
OF LITTLE FOOL?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.645
WHEN A ROOSTER
IS TIED UP THAT WAY,

24:38.812 --> 24:41.189
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS?

24:41.356 --> 24:43.316
[YELLING]
WELL, DON'T YOU?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.902
NO!
NO, I DON'T.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.196
A ROOSTER
WHO IS TIED UP
THAT WAY

24:48.363 --> 24:50.157
MEANS GOOD LUCK.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.783
IT MEANS I'M GOING
TO BE COMING HOME

24:51.950 --> 24:53.410
WITH A POCKET
FULL OF MONEY,

24:53.577 --> 24:55.287
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS
ANYTHING KNOWS THAT.

24:55.453 --> 24:58.248
JUST LIKE YOU KNOW
THAT DRIED SPIDERS
CURE THE AGUE,

24:58.415 --> 25:00.125
AND WOLF DROPPINGS
CURE THE COLIC.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.043
ANYBODY
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING
KNOWS THAT!

25:02.210 --> 25:05.297
BUT YOU, YOU TURN
MY LITTLE ROOSTER
LOOSE.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.758
AND THAT
BROUGHT BAD LUCK.
THE WORST KIND.

25:08.925 --> 25:13.388
ONE HOUR
BEFORE I REACHED
THE FEED AND GRAIN,

25:13.555 --> 25:17.976
THE BOTTOM
FELL CLEAN OUT
OF THE CORN PRICE.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.477
OH, I SOLD,

25:19.644 --> 25:22.022
BUT I DIDN'T GET
HALF WHAT THE SACKS
WAS WORTH.

25:22.189 --> 25:25.734
- CALEB--
- JUST SHUT UP! MIND YOU!

25:25.901 --> 25:27.903
AND YOU.
DON'T YOU EVER

25:28.069 --> 25:30.614
TOUCH ANYTHING
AROUND HERE AGAIN.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.240
AND I'D TAKE
IT KINDLY

25:32.407 --> 25:35.952
IF YOU'D WEAR
A PROPER DRESS
FOR SUPPER.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.508
IT'LL BE
A FEW MINUTES

25:50.675 --> 25:52.761
IF YOU WANT TO WASH UP.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.806
THANK YOU.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.201
I COULD'VE DONE THAT.

26:16.368 --> 26:18.662
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALMOST DONE.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.624
I CAN EMPTY THE BUCKET.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.794
IF YOU LIKE.

26:28.964 --> 26:32.092
I BEEN HAVING TROUBLE
TIMING SIXES AND NINES.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.219
I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU MIGHT--

26:34.386 --> 26:36.221
TOMORROW, JOSHUA.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.722
LIKE NINE TIMES SIX.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.557
YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF
IF YOU REALLY TRY.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.394
I'VE BEEN TRYING.
I CAN'T FIGURE IT
IN MY HEAD,

26:42.560 --> 26:44.646
AND I DON'T HAVE A SLATE
OR A SLATE PENCIL

26:44.813 --> 26:46.022
OR ANY PAPER AND PENCIL.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.857
YOU DON'T NEED
PENCIL OR PAPER.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.484
SOFT DIRT LIKE THIS
AND A SHARP STICK,

26:49.651 --> 26:52.404
AND YOU'VE GOT
A PERFECT SLATE.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.614
YOU CAN SURE THINK
CIRCLES AROUND ME.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.617
CAN I JUST SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.911
ALL RIGHT
IF YOU HURRY.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.460
THERE.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.337
NO. THAT'S WRONG.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.548
YOU'VE GOT THE 2 NUMBERS
IN THE ANSWER REVERSED.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.717
THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.

27:16.011 --> 27:20.390
YOU KNOW...
YOU'RE MIGHTY PRETTY.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.183
I THINK THAT WILL BE
THE END OF OUR LESSON
FOR TODAY.

27:22.350 --> 27:26.271
WHY? I'M A FAST
LEARNER IF YOU JUST
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

27:26.438 --> 27:27.981
Miss Peel: JOSHUA!

27:28.148 --> 27:30.442
YOU DEVIL'S DISCIPLE!

27:30.608 --> 27:32.861
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THIS DAY!

27:33.028 --> 27:36.990
WHEN YOUR PA HEARS,
HE'LL RIP YOUR SOUL CLEAN!

27:37.157 --> 27:39.075
GET TO HOME!

IN TEMPTATION'S RAIMENT.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.838
YOU WILL BURN!

27:52.005 --> 27:55.842
OH, YOU WILL BURN!

28:13.860 --> 28:15.028
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
TAKE YOUR HAIR

28:15.195 --> 28:17.238
OUT OF BRAIDS
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED

28:17.405 --> 28:18.907
AND BRUSH IT
REALLY GOOD.

28:19.074 --> 28:21.576
THEN IT'LL STAY
REALLY HEALTHY, OK?

28:21.743 --> 28:22.744
OK.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.120
YOU'VE GOT
PRETTY HAIR.

29:28.977 --> 29:31.896

STRUCK DOWN SICK.

29:32.063 --> 29:33.314
WOULD HAVE DIED, TOO,

29:33.481 --> 29:35.483
IF MISS PEEL HADN'T KNOWED
TO COME TO MY HOUSE.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.193
IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN--

29:37.360 --> 29:41.614
OH, NO. YOU'LL
CAST NO SPELL ON ME.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.909
I'M TOO STRONG FOR YOU.

29:45.076 --> 29:48.705
YOU SHOULD BE DOWN
ON YOUR KNEES PRAYING, GIRL,

29:48.872 --> 29:51.875
IN THANKS THAT

MY BOY JOSHUA THROUGH.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.753

30:03.386 --> 30:04.929

30:05.096 --> 30:08.391
YOU'LL BE
THE MOST SORRY PERSON
EVER LEAVE THESE PARTS.

30:08.558 --> 30:10.768
YOU UNDERSTAND?

30:24.741 --> 30:26.951
KATIE'S NOT FEELING GOOD.

30:27.118 --> 30:30.079
SHE WON'T BE GOING
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

32:10.888 --> 32:11.973
MUST BE A GOOD BOOK.

32:12.140 --> 32:15.560
OH, IT IS.
IT'S ALICE GARVEY'S.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.103

I'D RETURN IT ON SUNDAY,

32:17.270 --> 32:19.063
AND I'M NOT EVEN
HALFWAY THROUGH YET.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.356
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

32:20.523 --> 32:23.860
DRESSES--
STYLES, PATTERNS.

AND I WASN'T HUNGRY.

33:18.665 --> 33:21.584
MY FIRST REAL TEACHING JOB,

33:21.751 --> 33:24.921
AND I REALLY MESSED IT UP.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.840
WELL, YOU HAD
PLENTY OF HELP.

PEOPLE UP THERE,
THEY THINK SHE CAN
CAST SPELLS OR--

33:35.556 --> 33:39.686
OR POINT A FINGER
AND BURN DOWN A BARN.

33:39.852 --> 33:43.606
THEY THINK SHE'S
SOME KIND OF WITCH.

33:43.773 --> 33:46.317
SHE HATES SCHOOLS...

33:46.484 --> 33:48.903
BOOKS.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.322
I KNOW SHE HATES ME.

33:53.157 --> 33:56.160
YOU WERE RIGHT.
YOU HAD REASON TO LEAVE.

33:56.327 --> 33:57.829
SHE WENT AROUND
TELLING LIES ABOUT ME

33:57.995 --> 33:59.956
SO THE PARENTS WOULD KEEP
THEIR CHILDREN HOME.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.999
IT'S OVER NOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.169
IT DOESN'T MATTER?
OF COURSE IT MATTERS!

34:05.336 --> 34:07.213
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT
IF PEOPLE--PEOPLE BELIEVED

34:07.380 --> 34:10.383
TERRIBLE THINGS
SOMEBODY SAID ABOUT YOU.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.762
THE CHILDREN WERE--

34:14.929 --> 34:19.225
WERE SHY AND SCARED
AT FIRST, BUT--

34:19.392 --> 34:21.519
BUT AFTER A LITTLE WHILE,

34:21.686 --> 34:24.188
THEY WERE STUDYING,

34:24.355 --> 34:25.481
AND THEY WERE LEARNING,

34:25.648 --> 34:28.860
AND THEY REALLY
ENJOYED IT.

34:29.026 --> 34:31.279
IT'S AS IF WE'D
OPENED A DOOR

34:31.446 --> 34:33.948
AND SHE SLAMMED IT SHUT.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.910
SHE RUINED OUR SCHOOL.

34:39.787 --> 34:42.373
THAT SHE DID.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.167
SOMETIMES I THINK--

34:44.333 --> 34:47.336
I THINK BIGOTS
ARE JUST THERE,
LIKE THE MOUNTAINS--

34:47.503 --> 34:49.672
JUST AS HARD TO CHANGE.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.425
WELL, SOMEBODY
OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.179
WELL, IT'D TAKE
SOMEBODY PRETTY STRONG.

35:07.648 --> 35:12.779
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE TELLING LIES
ABOUT ME.

35:12.945 --> 35:16.783
I THINK I'LL GO BACK THERE
AND TELL THE FOLKS UP THERE
THE TRUTH.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.701
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I DID?

35:18.868 --> 35:21.078
THAT'S WHAT I'VE
BEEN WAITING TO HEAR.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.664
THE REVEREND ALDEN
WON'T BE PREACHING THERE
FOR ABOUT A MONTH.

35:23.831 --> 35:27.710
HE SAID THAT MISS PEEL
PRESIDES OVER THE
SERVICES EVERY SUNDAY.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.086
THAT'S RIGHT.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.173
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I
DROPPING IN
ON THAT MEETING?

35:32.340 --> 35:35.843
PA, I'D LIKE IT A LOT
IF YOU TOOK ME UP THERE, BUT--

35:37.428 --> 35:39.972
BUT I'M THE ONE
SHE TOLD THE LIES ABOUT.

35:41.432 --> 35:44.977
IT'S MY FIGHT, PA.

35:45.144 --> 35:48.564
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME
YOU'LL LET ME SAY
WHATEVER NEEDS SAYING.

35:50.441 --> 35:53.277
THAT'S A PROMISE.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.863
NOW, GO ON,
TELL YOUR MA.

35:56.030 --> 35:57.365
YES, SIR.

36:00.451 --> 36:01.702
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

36:01.869 --> 36:04.789
SHE'S GONNA BE SORRY
SHE GOT MY DANDER UP.

36:41.409 --> 36:46.163
TODAY'S LESSON:
THE LORD'S WORD,

36:46.330 --> 36:51.002
AS GIVEN TO US
IN HIS TEN COMMANDMENTS--

36:51.168 --> 36:55.673
WE SHALL WORSHIP
ONLY ONE GOD.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.719
WE DO NOT ADORE
GRAVEN IMAGES.

36:59.886 --> 37:02.889
WE DO NOT PROFANE
THE SABBATH.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.140
WE--

37:12.189 --> 37:15.276
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

37:15.443 --> 37:17.778
WE CAME TO ATTEND
THE MEETING.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.198
MOST OF YOU
DON'T KNOW ME.

37:21.365 --> 37:22.909
MY NAME IS MARY INGALLS.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.077
THIS IS MY FATHER.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.748
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME.

37:28.915 --> 37:32.919
I'M NOT SURPRISED,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:40.676 --> 37:44.055
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A TALK, MISS PEEL,

37:44.221 --> 37:48.225
AND WE CAN START NOW
OR AFTER THE MEETING.

37:48.392 --> 37:51.437
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU...

37:51.604 --> 37:53.648
JEZEBEL.

37:57.735 --> 38:00.154
OH, BUT YOU HAVE.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.783
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME,

38:03.950 --> 38:06.285
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL
MY FATHER,

38:06.452 --> 38:08.996
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL ALL THESE PEOPLE

38:09.163 --> 38:14.502
HOW YOU--HOW YOU DARE
TO CALL ME THAT.

38:14.669 --> 38:17.838
DO YOU WANT TO START NOW,
OR DO YOU WANT TO FINISH
YOUR LESSON?

38:21.092 --> 38:24.553
I BELIEVE
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.556
YOU HAD GOTTEN
AS FAR AS THE THIRD.

38:31.602 --> 38:36.190
THE FOURTH:
DO NOT TAKE THE NAME
OF THE LORD IN VAIN.

38:36.357 --> 38:40.861
THE FIFTH: HONOR
THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER.

38:41.028 --> 38:45.116
THE SIXTH:
THOU SHALT NOT KILL.

38:45.282 --> 38:46.534
THE SEVENTH--

38:46.701 --> 38:51.622
DO UNTO OTHERS
AS YOU WOULD HAVE
OTHERS DO UNTO YOU.

38:51.789 --> 38:54.875
THAT'S NOT ONE
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.252
IT'S THE GOLDEN RULE.

38:56.419 --> 38:59.296
IT'S THE SEVENTH.

38:59.463 --> 39:02.341
IT'S FROM THE SERMON
ON THE MOUNT.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.469
"THEREFORE ALL THINGS

39:05.636 --> 39:09.056
"WHOSOEVER YE THAT MAN
WOULD DO TO YOU,

39:09.223 --> 39:11.934
"DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM.

39:12.101 --> 39:15.271
"FOR THIS IS THE LAW
AND THE PROPHETS."

39:15.438 --> 39:16.981
<i>MATTHEW,</i> 7:12.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.733
YOU'RE WRONG!

39:18.899 --> 39:21.819
IT'S THE SEVENTH
COMMANDMENT,
YOU LITTLE FOOL.

39:25.448 --> 39:28.701
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
A BIBLE IN YOUR HAND.

39:28.868 --> 39:30.327
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
AND SEE?

39:30.494 --> 39:32.872
DON'T HAVE TO LOOK.
I KNOW.

39:33.039 --> 39:35.750
DO YOU, MISS PEEL?

39:35.916 --> 39:37.334
HAVE YOU READ IT,

39:37.501 --> 39:40.046
OR ARE YOU JUST
REPEATING WHAT YOU'VE
HEARD AND MEMORIZED?

39:40.212 --> 39:44.884
I CAN! I LIVE
BY THE GOOD BOOK.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.302
THOUSANDS...

39:46.469 --> 39:50.389
AND THOUSANDS
OF WORDS IN THE BIBLE.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.184
READ US SOME OF
THOSE WORDS YOU LIVE BY!

39:53.350 --> 39:54.977
WHY DON'T YOU
READ US <i>EXODUS</i> 20?

39:55.144 --> 39:58.355
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.733
I DON'T HAVE
TO READ YOU ANYTHING!

40:00.900 --> 40:03.319
CAN YOU READ?

40:03.486 --> 40:05.196
GO AWAY! GET OUT!

40:05.362 --> 40:08.407
WHY DON'T YOU READ US
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT--
THE ONE YOU BROKE?

40:13.954 --> 40:16.957
READ IT!
JUST READ IT!

40:25.716 --> 40:29.095
YOU CAN'T READ.

40:31.639 --> 40:35.267
THE DEVIL
IS NOT WELCOME HERE.

40:44.068 --> 40:47.905
MISS PEEL DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE TO LEARN TO READ.

40:50.324 --> 40:53.077
SHE HATES BOOKS...

40:53.244 --> 40:55.579
AND SHE HATES SCHOOLS.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.583
SHE WANTED
THE SCHOOL CLOSED.

40:59.750 --> 41:03.420
THAT'S WHY SHE BROKE
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT.

41:03.587 --> 41:07.466
I AM A GOD-FEARING
CHRISTIAN WOMAN.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.427
I DID NOT BREAK
ANY COMMANDMENT.

41:10.594 --> 41:11.887
Mary: THE NINTH:

41:12.054 --> 41:14.890
YOU SHALL NOT
BEAR FALSE WITNESS
AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR.

41:15.057 --> 41:16.100
I DID NOT!

41:16.267 --> 41:17.810
YOU DID!

41:17.977 --> 41:21.939
YOU TOLD EVERY PARENT
OF EVERY CHILD
IN SCHOOL I WAS--

41:23.899 --> 41:25.818
I WAS A JEZEBEL.

41:25.985 --> 41:29.572
YOU ARE--A SINFUL STENCH

41:29.738 --> 41:32.616
IN THE NOSTRILS
OF THE RIGHTEOUS.

41:32.783 --> 41:35.119
SOAP AND WATER.

41:37.621 --> 41:40.958
IF I BROUGHT ANY ODOR
INTO THIS HOUSE,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS--

41:41.125 --> 41:44.170
PLAIN SOAP AND WATER.

41:50.301 --> 41:52.511
ARE YOU
TRYING TO SCARE ME?

41:55.723 --> 41:58.225
ARE YOU GOING TO
CALL DOWN THE LIGHTNING?

41:59.268 --> 42:01.645
DO IT, MISS PEEL!
DO IT!

42:21.999 --> 42:24.001
NO LIGHTNING?

42:27.046 --> 42:29.673
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MISS PEEL?

42:29.840 --> 42:32.468
I SAW YOU ENTICING,

42:32.635 --> 42:34.511
TEACHING THE WAYS
OF THE DEVIL!

42:34.678 --> 42:38.265
YOU SAW ME TEACHING
ONE OF MY STUDENTS
MANNERS.

42:40.392 --> 42:44.230
THAT STUDENT YOU SAW
IS HERE.

42:44.396 --> 42:47.358
HE CAN TELL US ALL
WHAT HAPPENED...

42:47.524 --> 42:48.984
UNLESS HE WANTS
TO BEAR FALSE WITNESS

42:49.151 --> 42:52.821
AND BREAK
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT.

42:52.988 --> 42:54.990
GO ON, SON.
YOU TELL THEM.

42:59.078 --> 43:00.996
TELL THEM, BOY.

43:18.806 --> 43:23.018
I--I SCRATCHED
A PROBLEM IN THE DIRT

43:23.185 --> 43:25.562
AND GOT THE ANSWER WRONG.

43:27.022 --> 43:29.233
MISS INGALLS
WAS TRYING TO HELP.

43:37.283 --> 43:40.577
I TRIED TO STEAL A KISS,
AND SHE LIKE TO BUST MY RIBS.

43:47.251 --> 43:50.129
YOU WERE SICK, BOY.

43:51.547 --> 43:53.590
YOUR EYES
'MOST SWOLL SHUT.

43:53.757 --> 43:56.802
JUST DUST, PA.
DUST AND RUBBING.

43:56.969 --> 43:59.179
THAT'S ALL,
TILL AFTER SHE COME--

43:59.346 --> 44:01.598
MISS PEEL, I MEAN.

44:01.765 --> 44:04.435
SHE PUT SOMETHING IN THEM,
AND I COULDN'T SEE.

44:04.601 --> 44:07.771
UH, MY SPECIAL POTION,

44:07.938 --> 44:09.523
THAT'S ALL.

44:09.690 --> 44:12.067
MISS PEEL,
SHE THE ONE
THAT CURED YOU.

44:12.234 --> 44:13.569
SHE MADE YOU
SEE GOOD.

44:13.736 --> 44:16.238
NO, PA.
MA CURED ME.

44:16.405 --> 44:19.992
SHE WASHED MY EYES
WITH CLEAN WATER,
MAYBE 20 TIMES.

44:20.159 --> 44:23.287
Woman: I DID,

44:23.454 --> 44:27.041
WHILE HE
WAS TO THE FISHERS' HOUSE,

44:27.207 --> 44:31.128
BEARING FALSE WITNESS
AGAINST MISS INGALLS.

44:39.428 --> 44:41.430
WELL, MISS PEEL?

45:08.457 --> 45:12.211
THE LESSON FOR TODAY
WAS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS,

45:12.378 --> 45:18.050
BUT I THINK WE'VE
ALL HAD ENOUGH OF THOSE.

45:18.217 --> 45:21.220
BEFORE COMING UP HERE
TODAY, I...

45:22.679 --> 45:26.350
I LOOKED THROUGH
THE BIBLE FOR PROOF
OF GOD'S LOVE FOR MAN.

45:29.603 --> 45:31.021
I THINK A HAPPIER LESSON

45:31.188 --> 45:33.816
MIGHT BE TAKEN
FROM PSALM 133--

45:35.984 --> 45:40.364
"BEHOLD, HOW GOOD
AND PLEASANT IT IS

45:40.531 --> 45:43.158
"FOR BRETHREN TO DWELL
TOGETHER IN UNITY."

45:46.036 --> 45:47.704
GOD'S WORLD ISN'T...

45:47.871 --> 45:52.501
FEAR AND--AND HATE.

45:54.503 --> 45:57.840
IT'S LOVE AND--

45:58.006 --> 46:00.175
AND UNDERSTANDING.

46:00.342 --> 46:02.386
AMEN TO THAT.

46:04.096 --> 46:07.558
Mary: AND LEARNING IS PART
OF THAT UNDERSTANDING.

46:07.724 --> 46:10.602
SCHOOL WILL BE OPEN
ON MONDAY MORNING

46:10.769 --> 46:13.605
FOR ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO LEARN.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.525
