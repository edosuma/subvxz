Lame.

- What?

04:34.316 --> 04:38.654
- Ah, julien, I don't want to alarm you,
but you're kind of invisible.

Don't worry.
I'll be back to fix this.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.556
- Ah, check it out.
Not here. huh.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.684
- Lost it.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.394
I'm gonna need some help.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.439
Coast is clear. No sign of skipper.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.732
- You should just tell him.
- No!

05:15.732 --> 05:19.027
No, this is only a minor setback.
I'm sure between the two of us,

05:19.027 --> 05:23.323
we'll be able to find an invisible
machine randomly roaming the city.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.451
- And where are you two going?

05:27.286 --> 05:29.371
we were just going to...

05:29.663 --> 05:30.789
- Get some snow cones.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.125
- Snow cones?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.879
Ah, good call.
A little r&r is just what this outfit needs.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.338
Come on, men.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.007

05:40.007 --> 05:41.925

05:41.967 --> 05:44.720

05:44.720 --> 05:46.555
- You--you do?

05:46.555 --> 05:47.890
Dr. Blowhole!

05:47.890 --> 05:50.684
This has his mad flipper prints all over it.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.811
Not this time, Blowhole!

05:52.811 --> 05:56.231
You hear me? You bottlenosed freak!

05:59.484 --> 06:02.654
And just where do you think you're going?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.826
Something's wrong with these nuts!

06:07.826 --> 06:11.371
- I'll say.
They've got elephant boogies all over them.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.668
- This not-being-seen has its fun side.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.922
- Funny business at 12 o'clock.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.966
- What are we gonna tell skipper?

06:22.966 --> 06:26.887
- You mean, until I think of something that's plausible but not the truth?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.349
- We're onto your sick dolphin trick.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.981
- No, frank just up and quit.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.485
- Curse you, Blowhole!

06:41.485 --> 06:43.820
- Kowalski, kowalski! kowalski!

06:43.820 --> 06:48.325
- Private, I'm sorry for this sudden emotional outburst, but you need to focus!

06:48.325 --> 06:49.868
- Oh, I'm okay now.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.869
No! I'm not!

06:50.869 --> 06:53.330
- Look, we found the transmatterer, so that's good

06:53.330 --> 06:56.458
- Right. jolly good.
- Now I just need to get close to shut it down.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.001
- And that's easy-peasy for you.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.670
- No, it's not!

07:03.048 --> 07:04.967
- Hello? who's messing with joey?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.969
Show your face!

07:14.101 --> 07:17.271
- Whoa, that dolphin's really kicked up the crazy.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.690
It's some sort of invisible weapon.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.441
- Meaning that the weapon turns things invisible

07:24.444 --> 07:26.530
Uh, of course, I'm totally guessg.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.783
- Why would blowhole make an invisibility ray?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
Disintegrating is more his thing.

07:32.286 --> 07:37.082
- Um, who can fathom the mind of an evil genius?

07:37.082 --> 07:40.502
Right?
- Right.
Kowalski, deranged dolphin options.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.087
- Ooh, the bus!

07:42.212 --> 07:43.839
- Private, that's quitter talk.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.591
This unit doesot t d n.

07:45.591 --> 07:48.051
- No, I say we ram it with the bus.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.845
You can't! That might destroy the tran...

07:49.845 --> 07:52.139
transportation system as we know it?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.016
Nah, it's just one bus.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.476
- Yo, bada, it's my turn.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.147
- Hey, what you do that for?

08:00.147 --> 08:01.773
- I didn't do nothing.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.692
- Yo, you giving me the business?

08:03.692 --> 08:06.028
- Absolutely am not giving you the business.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.030
- Somebody's giving me the business.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.489
 Well, it ain't me, gabagool.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.617
- Well, then, who's giving me the business?

08:11.617 --> 08:17.122
- Oh, what?
Have you not seen a tire swinging all by itself before?

08:21.335 --> 08:23.629
- Men, I won't lie to you.

08:23.629 --> 08:29.051
The odds that we all pull through this
are less than a white christmas in tallahassee.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.636
Florida?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.222
Generally warmish in december.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.683
How about this? the odds stink.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.019
- Tell him!
- Skipper, i-- - feel the same, kowalski.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.648
It's been an honor serving with you too.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.982
Let's roll!

08:49.947 --> 08:51.198
- Steady.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.700
Steady.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.285
Jump!

08:59.790 --> 09:03.710
We've stopped blowhole, saved the city,
and lived to tell about it.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.254
Good on us!.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.340
- Oh! - kowalski, report.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.594
- Sounds like an overload, skipper.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.430
If this thing explodes, it could turn everything invisible.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.598
- Can you defuse it?

09:16.598 --> 09:20.811
- WELL, I...[sighs] I could reverse the polarity, making everything visible again

09:20.853 --> 09:23.230
but I'd need my tools, and they're all the way back in the--

09:27.025 --> 09:29.236
- I knew something bad was gonna happen.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.320
- Relax, private

09:30.320 --> 09:34.616
all I need to do is push a series of geometrically shaped buttons in the right order.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.121
SQUARE.
Triangle. yes.
Hexagon.

09:39.371 --> 09:43.542
Oh, and the rarest of all, an inverted dodecahedron.

09:43.584 --> 09:47.171
- You really know your evil bottlenose tech there, kowalski.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.727
- Ooh, I am a spooky banana.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.520
How do I float in front of

10:03.520 --> 10:08.275
your stupefied, hairy faces?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.944
Maybe I am a magic talking fruit.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.946
Yes? maybe.
Look.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.490
- Yo, bada, you see what I see?

10:15.532 --> 10:18.702
SILLY MONKEY APES.
Nobody is seeing me.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
- Hey, we ain't nobody, lemur.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.041
- Uh, monkey apes, what are you doing?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.293
I'M HERE!

10:27.961 --> 10:29.796
- Look at all these safety features.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.383
- Yes, clearly, the invention itself was flawless.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.845
- Maybe if you'd step up your game to blowhole's level,

10:36.845 --> 10:38.597
we could risk you back in the lab.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.558
- Well, as it turns out-- 
- turns out it's tough for you to 

10:41.600 --> 10:44.895
appreciate someone else's achievement. I get it.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.065

- dream of this kind of breakthrough.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.525
Well, keep dreaming

10:49.525 --> 10:51.693

10:51.693 --> 10:53.362
No, no, no, see, I was going to say--

10:53.362 --> 10:54.613

10:54.613 --> 10:56.782
- We've earned those snow cones.
