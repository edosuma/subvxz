00:01.000 --> 00:02.798
<i>[Marc] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:05.929
This is Anne Frazier
from Mercy Park Regional HMO.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.634
I'm just calling to confirm
your 2:00 appointment.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.040
It sounded like you had
legitimate claims.

00:11.111 --> 00:14.012
- That's a mistake.
- The first time we kissed...

00:14.080 --> 00:17.982
- And you said, "Careful..."
- "We're gonna cause a spark."

00:18.051 --> 00:22.317
- [Man] Why didn't you burn it?
- I couldn't. The music box is personal.

00:22.389 --> 00:25.620
But it connects you to Fey.
It could provide a motive.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.320
- Who knows about the affair?
- No one, but my wife.

00:28.395 --> 00:31.728
This woman is trying to connect
your father to Fey Sommers.

00:31.798 --> 00:35.734
She's doing more than that. She's
trying to connect him to Fey's death.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.367
<i>Hola! Happy Halloween!</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:45.978
[Laughing]

00:46.046 --> 00:47.707
- [Wilhelmina] Marc!
- [Gasps]

00:47.781 --> 00:52.377
That is the absolute
cruelest thing I've ever seen.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.647
Someone's getting a raise.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.453
[Ignacio] Betty, come here!

01:01.795 --> 01:02.887
Dad!

01:02.962 --> 01:06.329
[Ignacio] In the kitchen.
I've been waiting for breakfast forever.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.891
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you,
first. It's kind of important.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.730
Dad?

01:12.806 --> 01:14.034
Dad!

01:14.207 --> 01:15.674
[Screams]

01:15.742 --> 01:18.267
I told you, I've been waiting "forever!"

01:18.344 --> 01:19.333
Good one.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.506
Dad, I just talked to the HMO
lady and there's no mistake.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.109
They pulled up your social security
number, it said you're 117...

01:26.186 --> 01:27.676
...and, oh yeah, dead.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.382
Yeah? Well, I still look better
than this guy.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.584
Justin, you're gonna be late!

01:32.659 --> 01:36.652
Papi, I only work a half a day, I'll
come home and help decorate the outside.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.924
Get the candy,
make sure you get good stuff.

01:38.998 --> 01:42.627
I don't want to be the "raisin house"
again. You're asking to get egged.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.795
Happy Halloween!

01:44.871 --> 01:48.238
- Guess who I am.
- A proud member of America's Navy, sir.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.572
<i>No, I'm Gene Kelly from On The Town!</i>

01:50.643 --> 01:53.669
But let's tell everybody at school
you're a sailor, OK?

01:53.746 --> 01:56.476
Fine, but I'm a sailor
that can sing and tap.

01:56.549 --> 01:59.109
<i>New York, New York
you're a hell of a town</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:01.676
<i>The Bronx is up
and the Battery's down</i>

02:01.754 --> 02:05.952
<i>New York, New York
you're a hell of a town</i>

02:06.226 --> 02:07.284
And dance break!

02:09.628 --> 02:12.154
Better hope he can sing
and tap and throw a punch.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.158
- You and Walter got plans tonight?
- We'll pass out candy

02:16.236 --> 02:18.431
<i>and then go to
a midnight showing of Saw.</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:21.474
Oh, that's sweet. You did
the right thing taking him back.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.476
- You don't want to watch that alone.
- We're just dating.

02:24.544 --> 02:28.310
Listen, just now, when I told the HMO
lady there had to be a mistake...

02:28.381 --> 02:31.646
- What mistake?
- Dad's social security number.

02:31.718 --> 02:34.312
They say it belongs to a dead guy.
That's why...

02:34.387 --> 02:36.355
...they're not covering him anymore.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.946
What? Dad...

02:38.024 --> 02:39.651
[groaning]

02:40.894 --> 02:43.294
Help me!

02:46.332 --> 02:48.425
[Whimpering] Please!

02:50.236 --> 02:51.863
Are you finished?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.997
Come on, that was good stuff.

02:54.073 --> 02:57.372
I tried it on the paperboy this morning.
He peed himself.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.707
- I gotta go.
- Me too.

02:59.779 --> 03:04.045
Dad, you need to go down there and show
them you're alive. They think I'm crazy.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.843
Marc, I need you to
go down to the Closet

03:07.921 --> 03:10.947
and tell that drunken Irishwoman
to bring my gown for the ball.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.616
- She's Scottish.
- Don't care.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.684
Of course not. You may want
to return some of these.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.821
Calvin needs to reschedule lunch,

03:17.897 --> 03:22.857
Karl wants to know if you're going to be
in St. Moritz for the holiday, and um...

03:22.936 --> 03:25.029
Nico's called twice.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.402
Don't spoil my morning,
I'm in too good a mood.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.568
So your date last night went well.

03:31.644 --> 03:32.975
Oh, yes.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.913
Jason dipped his toe
into Lake Wilhelmina,

03:35.982 --> 03:39.645
and let's just say
the water was very warm.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.153
I'm not sure I want
to know what that means.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.420
It's refreshing to be with someone
who knows how to keep... up.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.358
I invited him to the ball tonight.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.420
A second date? Oh, my.

03:51.497 --> 03:55.490
Well, how can I resist?
We just look so good together.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.059
Apparently, you're not
the only one who thinks so.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.571
<i>Well, unless that was
her secret love child,</i>

04:00.640 --> 04:04.132
<i>somebody should call the cops,
Mode magazine's Wilhelmina Slater</i>

04:04.210 --> 04:06.440
is most definitely robbing the cradle.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.343
<i>Someone should tell that woman</i>

04:08.414 --> 04:13.181
<i>wearing a young man on your arm doesn't
always cover the parts that 'jiggle. "</i>

04:13.720 --> 04:17.850
Can't we give her a Lifetime Achievement
Award and put her out of our misery?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.423
Would you like to
return some of those calls?

04:22.195 --> 04:24.959
I'd like you to call Jason.
Tell him tonight is off.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.595
- But... you like him.
- Too bad.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.330
He's making me look like
Miss Jane Pittman.

04:31.404 --> 04:35.033
Flip through my Rolodex,
find someone else to escort me tonight.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.511
Take that ridiculous costume off. I can
barely stand looking at the real one.

04:42.548 --> 04:46.382
<i>[Maxine Nightingale:
Right Back To Where We Started From]</i>

04:49.355 --> 04:50.379
<i>[Record scratches]</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:51.946
- Gotcha!
- Walter!

04:52.025 --> 04:55.290
- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- Happy Halloween.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.897
For you. Bigger than last year's.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.162
- You got me the cherry sour balls.
- See, I know what you like.

05:02.235 --> 05:06.171
There's a little surprise at the bottom,
but you have to eat your way to it.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.365
- OK.
- No cheating.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.501
OK. Thank you. Look, I'm gonna see you
tonight. I'm late for work. I gotta go.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.841
- OK, I'm gonna miss you.
- OK.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.347
<i>[Music continues]</i>

05:16.416 --> 05:17.678
Walter.

05:17.750 --> 05:21.186
- You didn't say you'll miss me.
- I'll miss you.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.119
I will.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.992
Ta-da!

05:29.429 --> 05:32.796
Let me guess, when you got on
the elevator, you were a caterpillar.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.355
Where are your costumes?

05:34.434 --> 05:38.029
<i>What about the e-mail you sent me
about the Mode costume contest...</i>

05:38.104 --> 05:40.436
which... was...

05:40.506 --> 05:42.736
...obviously sent only to me.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.243
Right. Well, then...

05:46.312 --> 05:48.246
...I guess this means I win.

05:53.086 --> 05:57.113
- Uh... OK, I have a job for you.
- Great! Fire away.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.055
I need you to find my watch.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.320
- Found it!
- My other watch.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.795
It's a Simon Kouveaux.
It was a gift.

06:04.864 --> 06:09.028
I left it at some woman's apartment last
week. I need it for the ball tonight.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.366
Will you see the woman
who gave it to you?

06:11.437 --> 06:12.904
No, I'll see Simon Kouveaux.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.907
He's co-hosting and gets bitchy
when you don't wear his line.

06:15.975 --> 06:19.035
OK, well, you just tell me
who this woman is and I'll ask her.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.746
Right, except I don't
exactly remember who it was.

06:24.417 --> 06:28.683
- You don't remember who you slept with?
- I remember. Don't give me the look.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.815
- What look?
- That one, the "All-Judging Butterfly."

06:31.891 --> 06:34.655
Not only do I remember
who I slept with,

06:34.727 --> 06:36.592
I even have some of their numbers.

06:36.662 --> 06:40.860
You have to match up names with nights
of the week, I'm fuzzy on that part.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.862
- Is this the look?
- I had a crazy week.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.564
Do you remember what you had
for lunch on Tuesday?

06:46.639 --> 06:50.097
Spinach pie. The cafeteria was
celebrating Greek Day. It was good.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.270
Why is this such a problem for you?
I'm an adult. OK?

06:53.346 --> 06:55.746
These women are adults.
Believe me, I checked.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.876
No one's hurt. I sleep with a different
woman every night of the week because...

06:59.952 --> 07:01.249
...why not?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.312
The Romans had a nine-day week.
You'd be a tired centurion.

07:04.390 --> 07:08.156
Find the watch, have Amanda cover
the phones. I'll be out of the office.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.024
[Betty] Oh, you have an appointment.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.326
Cancel it. I'll be back
in the afternoon.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.665
I thought you were handling this.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.434
- I am handling this.
- Who gave my son the music box?

07:21.507 --> 07:24.305
Who's filling his head
with stories about me and Fey?

07:24.377 --> 07:28.143
- You tell me. Who knew about you two?
- Not Daniel. That's the whole point.

07:28.481 --> 07:32.076
I've spent a lifetime trying to protect
him from knowing, now this...

07:32.151 --> 07:34.619
...someone is ruining it.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.851
This is my family,
do you understand?

07:38.391 --> 07:39.790
Understood.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.591
Anyway, look, if you've got it, please
call me back as soon as you can. Thanks.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.367
Is this why you called me over here?
To watch your phone skills?

07:54.440 --> 07:57.773
- Because they are great.
- I need you to help me cover the phone.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.473
Daniel left his watch in some
woman's apartment and...

08:01.881 --> 08:05.510
Please, like I care?
We're hardly exclusive.

08:05.585 --> 08:09.487
<i>It's not like I spend my evenings
thumbing through Modern Bride.</i>

08:13.092 --> 08:16.584
- How many are you calling?
- He doesn't remember when it happened,

08:16.662 --> 08:19.460
- so I'm calling one for each weeknight.
- Priceless.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.524
I need you to find addresses
for Tuesday and Wednesday.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.832
<i>Nymphalis milberti?</i>

08:25.738 --> 08:27.535
<i>Nymphalis milberti.</i>

08:28.407 --> 08:30.739
- Milbert's Tortoiseshell?
- I don't know.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.142
The pattern just said "Butterfly."

08:33.212 --> 08:34.839
Well... just something I know.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.972
One of several things, actually.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.948
Circumference of the Earth? Know it.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.919
<i>And this concludes another
episode of True But Dull.</i>

08:42.989 --> 08:45.549
Well, I should probably
get back down to Accounting.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.492
We paid a guy $50 to see
how much honey he can drink

08:48.561 --> 08:50.085
before he makes himself sick.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.133
You should come down later...
if you can.

08:55.201 --> 08:59.535
Oh... Oh, OK. Yeah, maybe.
If I have time.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.969
24,901 miles.

09:05.945 --> 09:09.142
The circumference of the Earth.
It's just something I know.

09:14.420 --> 09:18.982
Oh, my God. Were you just flirting
with Henry from Accounting?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.548
I should get workman's comp.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.617
I was not flirting.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.027
Why, was he?

09:25.097 --> 09:29.158
- What is this?
- Oh, Walter puts a surprise in for me.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.068
Last year it was
an engraved cell phone holster.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.429
What's the key for?

09:37.310 --> 09:41.246
It goes with the note.
He wants me to move in with him.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.662
Well... I can see why you're nervous.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.366
You two have only
just started dating again and

10:02.435 --> 10:05.529
he is the boy that dumped you
for the neighborhood hoochie.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.905
Yeah. But he's also
done everything short of skywriting

10:09.976 --> 10:12.069
"Forgive Me" to win me back.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.840
In four years he's never
forgotten my birthday.

10:16.248 --> 10:20.412
If I just sniffle
he's at my door with chicken soup.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.579
He's also the only guy I've ever...

10:25.858 --> 10:26.984
Oh.

10:27.059 --> 10:30.495
It's just, I don't wanna say no now
and risk losing him forever.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.464
Sorry, but that's a poor,
poor reason to say yes.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.625
He's the only boy you've ever known.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.794
He might turn out
to be the first pancake.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.360
- The what?
- The practice one.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.566
- The one you toss away.
- I don't toss away pancakes.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.634
Well, I'm only saying,
you've just come out of your cocoon.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.804
Why don't you spread
your wings a wee bit,

10:47.880 --> 10:50.178
see what's out there
before you settle back in?

10:50.249 --> 10:51.807
See who's out there!

10:51.884 --> 10:55.820
I have to go find Daniel's watch, so I'm
going to move, if I throw up, I'm sorry.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.322
Remember, butterflies don't mate
for life.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.883
Don't be afraid to get yourself
out there, taste a few more flowers.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.656
Flit.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.459
Flit. It's what butterflies do.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.090
Oh.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.727
I thought you were
cursing at me in Scottish.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.166
Hi, there!

11:18.244 --> 11:21.509
I don't keep candy in my house,
and you're too old to do this.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.981
No, no, no. I'm not trick or treating,
I work for Daniel Meade.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.485
I left messages,
I don't know if you got them,

11:27.553 --> 11:30.147
- about him leaving something here?
- I got them.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.214
Actually, I called him
a few times myself last week.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.760
Any idea why he didn't call me back?

11:35.828 --> 11:38.160
No, but I'd be happy to investigate.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.255
So, what, you do
his dirty work for him?

11:40.633 --> 11:44.364
What does he think I am? Some kind
of scratching post, or call girl?

11:44.437 --> 11:47.270
- He sent a secretary to blow me off?
- I'm an assistant.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.672
You wonder if Daniel left something?
Yeah, he left something,

11:50.743 --> 11:53.234
the last chance for happiness
he'll ever have!

11:57.817 --> 11:59.182
And these!

12:12.064 --> 12:15.500
- Help you?
- Yeah, I'm here to see one of your...

12:17.103 --> 12:19.367
...uh, your...
- Are you checking in?

12:19.438 --> 12:22.805
[Stammering] No, no, no! God, no.
I'm just a guest, a visitor.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.776
<i>- [phone ringing]
- I'm a relative of... Excuse me?</i>

12:26.445 --> 12:28.470
Hey. Did you find the watch?

12:28.547 --> 12:30.014
I'm narrowing it down.

12:30.082 --> 12:34.178
What do you think about sending flowers
before I knock on these women's doors?

12:34.253 --> 12:38.087
Wait, I'm getting beeped, it could be
Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.591
- Hello?
- Hey. You finish your candy yet?

12:40.659 --> 12:43.219
Walter, um, I can't talk right now.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.890
OK. Just tell me what layer you're on.
How close are you to the bottom?

12:46.966 --> 12:50.834
I'm not! Look, this just... it's just
not a good time. Can I call you back?

12:51.704 --> 12:54.229
- Daniel?
- So why flowers? Is someone upset?

12:54.306 --> 12:57.332
Well, Miss Friday's face
did get all red and sweaty.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.639
Not like a person sweats,
more like cheese.

12:59.712 --> 13:04.081
OK, fine, tell Amanda to send a dozen
roses to each, and I'll check in later.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.947
All right, bye.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.111
Claire Meade, please?

13:08.187 --> 13:11.213
- And who shall I say is visiting?
- Her son.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.382
- Possible escorts.
- Old.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.658
Way too old.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.958
Marc, I think this one's face
is on our money.

13:24.036 --> 13:28.200
You said you wanted one
that made you look young... er.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.304
How about finding me
someone who doesn't leak?

13:32.444 --> 13:35.345
Oh, she's a little
fragile today, so be nice.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.405
- I'm always nice.
- You're never nice.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.678
Right. I was thinking
about somebody else.

13:40.252 --> 13:45.087
And this is where we come
to lose ourselves in the classics.

13:45.925 --> 13:49.383
- It's a nice collection.
- It is.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.123
Nothing like making people
in detox read stories

13:52.198 --> 13:53.859
cooked up by a bunch of drunks.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.164
Did your father tell you
they confiscated my perfume?

13:57.236 --> 13:59.329
I guess they are worried you might...

13:59.405 --> 14:01.498
What? Drink it?

14:02.408 --> 14:03.966
Oh, come on, Daniel.

14:04.043 --> 14:07.604
Bad enough I can't board first class
with my liquid eyeliner,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.548
now I have to walk around
smelling like... people.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.510
- So why are you here?
- Just to talk.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.455
Well, I've been right here,
any time you wanted to come.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.651
I've been busy
the last couple of weeks.

14:20.726 --> 14:24.457
Almost four. They like to tell you
just how many days you've been in,

14:24.530 --> 14:26.691
so it passes more slowly.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.256
Today is sponsored by the number 26.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.370
I want to talk about Fey Sommers.

14:34.406 --> 14:39.503
Then I'm going to need lunch some place
they're not serving pudding cups.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.409
I'll explain it one more time.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.450
He misplaced his watch
and he thinks he may have left it

14:45.517 --> 14:47.985
at your apartment on...
Thursday night.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.487
No, and why didn't he
just come here himself?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.423
Because, you see, Daniel is...

14:53.492 --> 14:57.223
- He's out of the office mostly.
- Because, we had something special.

14:57.296 --> 15:01.232
I mean, I let him stay over,
I let him use my toothbrush.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.427
I even gave him the good pillow!

15:03.502 --> 15:07.495
Why would he say all those things to me
and not call me? It just doesn't make...

15:08.607 --> 15:12.373
Oh, my God,
you're trying to sabotage us.

15:12.444 --> 15:13.877
Are you sleeping with him?

15:13.946 --> 15:16.779
OK, um, look, I'm just gonna
write you down as a "no."

15:16.849 --> 15:19.215
Because I will not
give him up without a fight!

15:19.285 --> 15:20.582
[Tearing]

15:24.056 --> 15:27.184
Ew. I give up. How old is "old" to you?

15:27.993 --> 15:30.962
- Older than my dad.
- Hey, what's he doing tonight?

15:31.030 --> 15:35.592
- Drinking. Embezzling. Apologizing.
- He has a very full life.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.364
<i>[Amanda] Mode magazine,
how may I direct your call?</i>

15:39.371 --> 15:42.431
Aw, someone's turning back
into a caterpillar.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.136
Do you have those two addresses
I asked you to get?

15:45.210 --> 15:48.577
- Still working on it.
- Can I borrow your stapler, please?

15:55.587 --> 15:59.318
- Can I help?
- What? Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

15:59.391 --> 16:03.885
<i>Uh, if you were good, you could
leave here and join Cirque du Soleil.</i>

16:04.530 --> 16:06.464
<i>[Phone ringing]</i>

16:16.909 --> 16:18.467
That should do it.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.843
Now, I want you to try
to avoid crowded subway cars.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.883
Oh... and blue jays.
Natural predators.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.816
Right. OK. Thanks.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.218
So anyway, uh,

16:30.289 --> 16:33.087
you think maybe you'd like
to go get some lunch later?

16:33.158 --> 16:36.059
- What? No.
- Oh.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.255
Yeah, OK. That's cool.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.533
No... yes! I meant yes!

16:43.602 --> 16:46.196
- Yes?
- If that's still OK?

16:47.139 --> 16:49.232
Yeah, I think I
may still have an opening.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.369
- OK.
- 12:30?

16:51.443 --> 16:55.174
Yeah. 12:30.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.310
So, what about Monday night?

16:59.385 --> 17:02.411
- Isn't Daniel sending her flowers?
- What?

17:02.488 --> 17:05.480
Oh, no. He couldn't remember
who Monday was.

17:24.242 --> 17:28.236
- Ow! Ow!
- Sorry.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.640
What are you doing back there?
Did you screw up the zipper?

17:31.717 --> 17:35.676
The zipper's not the problem, lack of
a pulley and burly men is the problem.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.814
- What is she saying to me?
- Nothing. It's the beer talking.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.689
[Shouting] Maybe you ordered
the wrong size!

17:41.760 --> 17:44.558
I ordered a two,
she has always been a two,

17:44.630 --> 17:48.430
but clearly, someone's been enjoying
too many complimentary cheese straws.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.367
I understood that.
What are you saying, Carlotta?

17:51.437 --> 17:54.235
- Christina.
- There might be a slight possibility

17:54.306 --> 17:56.968
that she might have just,
maybe... gained...

17:57.443 --> 18:00.503
- Gained what?
- What? Nothing.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.572
Just maybe... like a little,
wee bit of... weight?

18:07.419 --> 18:12.550
[Screaming]

18:16.228 --> 18:18.822
So how are you?
Are you seeing anyone?

18:18.897 --> 18:21.525
Not any one person.
You know, a few.

18:22.234 --> 18:26.694
Our compliments, Mrs. Meade.
Good to see you. It's been far too long.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.603
Yes, it has.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.076
- Hey, that's mine, give that to me.
- Don't even start.

18:32.144 --> 18:35.807
I'm going to have the veal Marsala,
you do realize it's made with wine?

18:35.881 --> 18:37.109
The alcohol burns off.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.310
Then give me back the glass,
and set fire to me when I'm done.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.248
So are we going to talk
about that Christmas?

18:47.292 --> 18:50.625
- What Christmas?
- That Christmas. I was 12.

18:50.696 --> 18:54.132
Dad gave you a music box from Zurich,
one minute you're smiling,

18:54.199 --> 18:59.136
<i>the next you're using a creme brulee
torch to set fire to 1,000 Mode copies.</i>

18:59.204 --> 19:03.436
No? It was the Christmas you
found out about Dad's affair with Fey.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.909
Ah, yes.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.843
That does jingle a bell.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.048
- Betty, do you know what you want?
- I think I need another minute.

19:14.119 --> 19:16.053
- OK.
- Have you been here before?

19:16.121 --> 19:19.613
Because the caterpillar roll is awesome.
No offense.

19:19.691 --> 19:22.023
[Chuckling]

19:22.995 --> 19:26.021
Number four looks...

19:26.098 --> 19:30.034
...like an autopsy photo. I'm sorry.
Sorry. Totally inappropriate.

19:30.102 --> 19:34.471
- This the first time you've had sushi?
- No, God, no. Yes.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.940
- Then let's go somewhere else.
- No. Please.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.843
It's good for me to try new things,
you know? Spread my wings.

19:41.713 --> 19:45.376
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.887
All evidence to the contrary,
this is not my first time in public.

19:50.255 --> 19:54.191
It is mine. For parolees, these ankle
bracelets are the best thing ever.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.423
It's so stupid. I come into
Manhattan every single day for work,

20:00.499 --> 20:04.629
and times like these I feel like the
E-train dropped me off on Mars.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.501
Where I come from,
people like their fish cooked

20:07.573 --> 20:09.768
and they dress up for Halloween.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.546
Secret identity.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.076
<i>- [salsa music]
- [Sniffing]</i>

20:21.153 --> 20:25.852
- Something is burning. What is that?
- It's blood.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.915
My dinner.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.690
OK, you're pushing it.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.731
Kids come here for candy, not trauma.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.666
You can't have a haunted house
without spilling blood.

20:36.735 --> 20:41.172
- When Betty was a little girl, she...
- Papi, she's not a little girl anymore.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.572
- Neither am I.
- What are you talking about?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.406
Why does the HMO say you're dead?

20:48.547 --> 20:51.880
Why do they say that's not
your social security number?

20:52.417 --> 20:55.818
Did you come home to help me
or to ask me questions?

20:55.887 --> 20:59.550
Because if you came to help me,
hang this on the porch.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.819
Hi there, I'm calling from
the Sutton Place Medical Group.

21:03.895 --> 21:07.956
One of our patients, Daniel Meade, just
left and thought we should call you.

21:08.033 --> 21:11.434
The good thing about scabies is
if you treat the itching right away,

21:11.503 --> 21:13.994
there's little chance of them
becoming open sores.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.200
You might want to call your doctor.
OK. Bye-bye!

21:19.778 --> 21:22.542
Hi, I'm looking for Betty Suarez.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.309
She's out to lunch.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.583
- What?
- Do you know when she'll be back?

21:30.656 --> 21:35.025
She's at the sushi bar across the street
with what's-his-face. Go ask yourself.

21:35.994 --> 21:39.293
Hi there, I'm calling from
the Medical Group at Sutton Place.

21:39.364 --> 21:43.095
One of our patients, Daniel Meade,
thought we should give you a call.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.137
You can't imagine what it was like
seeing that woman

21:47.205 --> 21:49.696
holding my Christmas present
in that magazine.

21:50.108 --> 21:54.875
She called the house several times
and played the music box on the phone.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.675
You made him end it then, I assume.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.842
Of course. And I thought he had,
Daniel, I really did.

22:00.852 --> 22:04.253
- So when did he?
- Well, let's see, it's been...

22:04.323 --> 22:06.382
...I came here almost a month ago,

22:06.458 --> 22:08.688
so what I want to say is...

22:08.760 --> 22:11.160
...six weeks?
- What?

22:11.229 --> 22:15.256
Dad was having an affair with Fey
for 20 years and you didn't know?

22:15.334 --> 22:19.771
Well, Daniel, I don't know if you've
noticed, but I drink quite a lot.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.103
- I thought you took after Grandpa Jack.
- That didn't help.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.372
And there are certain things
one can inherit from a father.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.970
- Some of which should concern you.
- Such as?

22:29.047 --> 22:32.244
The philandering.
You and all your women.

22:32.317 --> 22:35.184
I see him in you.
Daniel, it destroyed our family.

22:35.554 --> 22:39.490
- What made him finally end it?
- Does that really matter now?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.688
It might.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.455
Then give me a drink.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.226
- Mom...
- A sip.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.767
That's all. Then I tell you
what you want to know.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.035
A sip.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.630
I made him choose.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.496
She wasn't going
anywhere on her own.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.195
So she and I went
over to his office,

23:25.270 --> 23:29.434
and we stood there in front of
that big, overcompensating desk of his,

23:29.508 --> 23:31.738
and we told him to make a choice.

23:31.810 --> 23:36.179
- Who did he choose?
- Well, one of us is here.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.840
And one of us is dead.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.415
So you figure it out.

23:43.054 --> 23:47.548
So I've noticed that you've been
on our floor quite a bit today.

23:47.626 --> 23:50.060
Have I? Hmm.

23:50.128 --> 23:52.289
Don't think it has
anything to do with you.

23:52.364 --> 23:56.528
I like to make the rounds, let employees
know Accounting has an eye on them.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.898
Right.

23:57.969 --> 24:00.028
Here. This is your piece.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.733
Now, close your eyes, and don't peek.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.641
<i>This is how Tom Hanks
survived in Cast Away.</i>

24:05.710 --> 24:07.200
I don't think so.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.579
[Muffled] Walter!

24:13.785 --> 24:16.310
- [Stammers] What are you doing here?
- Who is this guy?

24:16.388 --> 24:19.551
This is, um, this is Henry.
He works on the third floor.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.553
- Why haven't you returned my calls?
- I got busy!

24:24.629 --> 24:26.927
- Busy? Busy?
- Maybe I should get the check.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.465
Busy with what? A date?

24:28.533 --> 24:31.127
I ask you to move in with me
and you cheat on me?

24:31.203 --> 24:33.467
Walter, stop it,
you're embarrassing me.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.298
I'll pay the cashier.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.809
No, no, no, no.
You stay. I'll go.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.709
I embarrass her.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.721
Tighten the wrap, will you?

24:56.795 --> 24:59.764
I think I just felt
another pound drip off.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.822
Oh, my God, it's sweltering.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.993
Close the door.

25:04.069 --> 25:06.128
And crank up the thermostat all the way.

25:06.204 --> 25:09.196
You know, paper burns at 451 degrees.

25:09.274 --> 25:12.903
Good, you can become a science teacher
after I fire you. Now, crank it!

25:14.279 --> 25:17.180
I know you don't
want to hear this, but...

25:18.250 --> 25:21.014
- Nico called again.
- Of course I don't want to hear it.

25:21.086 --> 25:25.079
I have six hours to become ten years
younger and five pounds thinner.

25:25.156 --> 25:28.819
Nico is exactly what I do not
need today. What is that?

25:29.694 --> 25:31.059
- Salad.
- Take it away.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.654
- You have to eat.
- Whose side are you on, anyway?

25:33.732 --> 25:35.461
Get out!

25:37.536 --> 25:40.004
Maybe it's not as bad
as you're making it sound.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.665
Oh, no, it's worse
than I'm making it sound.

25:42.741 --> 25:44.868
I'm downplaying it
so I don't freak out

25:44.943 --> 25:47.571
that I not only humiliated myself
in front of Henry,

25:47.646 --> 25:49.477
but I probably lost Walter forever.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.516
I am so sorry, Betty.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.017
I feel as if... it was me,
I pushed you into this.

25:54.085 --> 25:56.747
It's not you, it's not you. I did it.

25:56.821 --> 26:00.222
When I am done with work, I'll find
Walter and beg him to forgive me.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.557
- And say you're gonna move in with him?
- Maybe, yeah.

26:03.628 --> 26:07.655
Some people, like Daniel, they can date
tons of people at once. I tried two...

26:07.732 --> 26:11.725
No, if there's one thing I've learned
today, it is that I'm not a flitter.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.668
And that my boss wears boxers.

26:13.738 --> 26:17.401
Silk boxers... so I've heard.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.980
There you are! Where've you been?

26:24.049 --> 26:27.280
I ran out for a size four.
And if this Valentino doesn't fit her,

26:27.352 --> 26:29.820
- I'll make her wear her drapes.
- She can't know!

26:29.888 --> 26:34.325
She won't. I plan on surgically removing
the evidence myself. Grabby fingers.

26:35.493 --> 26:40.692
Oh, and Betty, good luck with the...
you know, and keep me posted. Yes?

26:46.404 --> 26:48.304
What are you staring at?

26:48.373 --> 26:52.639
- I had the veal. The alcohol burns off.
- Mom... please.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.201
Listen to me.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.214
You have to go, I know, but listen.
I want you to be careful.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.580
I know, of dating too many women.
I got it.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.278
Of your father.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.550
I pushed him, he stuck me here.
I don't know what he'd do to you.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.716
Mom...

27:06.791 --> 27:10.090
...do you think Dad
is capable of murder?

27:11.062 --> 27:13.792
I think your father
is capable of anything.

27:16.635 --> 27:21.299
Amanda, if Daniel calls, tell him I've
gone out again to try and get his watch.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.098
- Who are those for?
- Oh...

27:24.175 --> 27:27.736
Tuesday's girl had already left for
her hostessing job when I called,

27:27.812 --> 27:30.781
so... I just sent her flowers to me.

27:31.516 --> 27:34.508
Hey, have you taken any messages
from Walter since lunch?

27:34.586 --> 27:36.019
Mm-mm.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.681
- Henry?
- Uh... mm-mm.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.632
You need to stop me
from going to see Henry.

27:57.709 --> 28:01.167
- I thought you were resolved on that.
- I was! Tell that to my finger.

28:01.246 --> 28:03.510
It wants me to push
the button to his floor.

28:03.581 --> 28:06.607
It wants me to go tell him
that I had a wonderful time today.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.347
- Cheeky finger.
- What is wrong with me?

28:09.421 --> 28:11.184
I'm turning into Daniel.

28:11.256 --> 28:15.056
I'll be able to juggle peoples' hearts
like fruit and still sleep at night.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.562
One, you're nothing like Daniel.
Two, he doesn't sleep much,

28:18.630 --> 28:22.691
which is why he loses jewelry and can't
remember who he shagged Monday night.

28:23.001 --> 28:23.990
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:24.069 --> 28:26.299
Roses. I have to go.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.903
- What?
- You sent yourself flowers.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.775
You're Monday's girl.

28:41.319 --> 28:43.810
Where are you going? Come back!

28:49.394 --> 28:52.761
What the hell are you doing?
Was this all just one big joke to you?

28:52.831 --> 28:55.265
Watching me run around
in a butterfly suit

28:55.333 --> 28:58.029
getting underwear thrown at my head,
all for laughs?

28:58.103 --> 29:00.401
Do I look like I'm laughing?

29:00.472 --> 29:03.703
Why didn't you say something
if you had this the entire time?

29:03.775 --> 29:05.140
Why?

29:05.210 --> 29:08.338
Maybe I was hoping Monday night
was the one night of the week

29:08.413 --> 29:12.076
your boss would remember!
Stupid me, huh?

29:18.456 --> 29:20.981
Does Daniel know that
you feel this way about him?

29:21.059 --> 29:24.290
Oh, please. He's Daniel Meade.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.989
Take a number and wait in line.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.799
I'm sure he feels
the same way about you, too.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.858
Don't you have some kind of agreement?

29:30.935 --> 29:33.028
Yeah, he dates anything that moves,

29:33.104 --> 29:36.562
and I agree to smile
and take their messages.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.608
And now I'm sending them flowers, too.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.103
Amanda, if you knew who he was,

29:43.181 --> 29:45.706
- why did you get so involved?
- [Sniffling]

29:45.784 --> 29:47.513
Because...

29:47.585 --> 29:50.486
...I thought he would
get sick of serial dating.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.658
I sure as hell am.

29:56.161 --> 29:58.288
And what if he doesn't?

29:59.264 --> 30:01.198
He will.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.756
I'll just wait.

30:04.769 --> 30:07.260
Here. Give this back to him.

30:08.573 --> 30:10.131
You can tell him how you feel.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.266
Uh-uh.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.873
Nope. No, no.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.914
Hey, guess what?

30:21.719 --> 30:23.584
What?

30:26.925 --> 30:28.859
This never happened.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.665
I want the truth!

30:36.734 --> 30:38.929
- Is this a size four?
- It's the designers.

30:39.003 --> 30:42.495
They have a cruel streak
when it comes to voluptuous women.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.132
- Where's the tag?
- I ate it.

30:44.209 --> 30:46.336
- Carlotta?
- Oh, yes, it's a four!

30:46.411 --> 30:47.901
[Groans]

30:49.414 --> 30:51.405
- [Tears]
- Oh!

30:51.816 --> 30:54.376
- It's OK.
- Oh, leave it!

30:55.620 --> 31:00.114
I can't deny it anymore, it's happened.
I've become a "woman of a certain age."

31:00.191 --> 31:02.955
Give me 20 minutes,
I can do something with pleats.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.656
I said leave it. I'm not going
to go to that ridiculous party.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.227
I can't compete anymore with
a bevy of 22-year-old gym-bodies.

31:12.837 --> 31:16.830
You starve yourself, pull yourself,
inject yourself, you think you're safe.

31:17.442 --> 31:20.070
They keep coming to the door,
younger and younger,

31:20.144 --> 31:23.341
like a hail of bullets,
until down you go.

31:24.582 --> 31:27.312
Why is it such a crime
to age in this business?

31:27.385 --> 31:30.252
It's true, the standards
for women are so punitive.

31:30.321 --> 31:33.950
And whose fault is that?
I set the standards.

31:34.025 --> 31:37.517
"Lifetime Achievement Award."
Oh, there's my achievement.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.324
It bit me in the ass...

31:39.397 --> 31:41.058
...and the hips.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.298
Serves me right, huh?
That's what you're thinking. Say it.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.339
Well, you know, well...

31:48.406 --> 31:51.273
...what I was thinking was,
yes, you do set the standards.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.572
You're Wilhelmina Slater,
for Pete's sake.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.510
Women look to you for inspiration.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.072
And when you go to that ball tonight
with that young man of yours,

31:59.150 --> 32:02.608
I guarantee, no woman
in America tomorrow morning

32:02.687 --> 32:06.384
will leave her house without a man
ten years younger than her.

32:06.457 --> 32:11.258
Or five years. A year?
Less. I don't know.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.635
Are you... gonna eat that sandwich?

32:21.839 --> 32:23.807
Oh, yeah.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.044
So shall I, uh,
shall I work my magic then?

32:34.652 --> 32:36.347
What's all that?

32:36.421 --> 32:39.015
Just some of the treasures from my day.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.558
Things you left scattered
over New York City.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.321
Where's the watch?

32:45.229 --> 32:48.130
Good for you. Which one had it?

32:48.199 --> 32:50.861
Does it matter?

32:50.935 --> 32:52.903
No. Not really, I guess.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.804
I didn't think so.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.171
I sent roses to those women.

32:58.242 --> 33:00.335
Amanda sent them, yeah.

33:00.411 --> 33:04.177
And, you know, you're right,
you can do whatever you want,

33:04.248 --> 33:07.911
go from one person to the next...
flit, flit, flit.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.921
But if you think that no one's
getting hurt, you're wrong.

33:12.390 --> 33:16.349
- Anything else you need from me?
- No, no, that'll be all.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.955
Betty, you know I've had a rough week.

33:21.966 --> 33:25.060
- I've got a lot on my mind.
- I know.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.239
I just hope that you deal with that
more directly than you handled this.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.447
[Gasping]

33:45.556 --> 33:47.581
Hail to the Queen!

33:47.658 --> 33:49.523
She lives! She breathes!

33:49.594 --> 33:52.620
What do you think of the decolletage?
Too much cleavage?

33:52.697 --> 33:55.495
I'd say... not enough.

33:55.967 --> 33:59.061
Jason! About time you showed up.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.537
You know I don't like
to be kept waiting. Hold it.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.632
You sure you want to be seen
with an old broad like me?

34:04.709 --> 34:08.610
A minute younger, and I'd have to
rip your clothes off right here.

34:12.315 --> 34:14.375
- Nice brows.
- Oh, thank you.

34:16.754 --> 34:19.382
Hi. I am so sorry
to interrupt you, but Nico...

34:19.456 --> 34:22.984
Got the messages, can't return them,
we're late for an engagement.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.858
...is here.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.429
Hi, Mom.

34:30.501 --> 34:31.797
Whoa.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.804
You're her mother?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.306
What can I say? Rule Number One.

34:40.378 --> 34:44.781
Never buy your mistress and your wife
the same Christmas present.

34:44.849 --> 34:49.581
I know how you must feel about me,
Daniel, I'm truly sorry about Fey. I am.

34:49.654 --> 34:52.589
I did everything I could to
keep you from getting hurt.

34:52.657 --> 34:58.118
- And Mom? What about her feelings?
- I was careless and stupid.

34:58.196 --> 35:01.723
And Fey wouldn't quit,
she didn't want to be my mistress,

35:01.799 --> 35:04.700
- she wanted to be a Meade.
- Is that why you had her killed?

35:05.803 --> 35:08.067
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know, Dad.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.030
Why don't you tell me?

35:14.045 --> 35:16.411
Tell you what?
That I loved her?

35:17.782 --> 35:20.546
- Because I did.
- More than Mom?

35:21.352 --> 35:23.217
I don't know.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.657
- More than all the others, for sure.
- Others?

35:27.725 --> 35:32.321
Many, many others. Who do you think
is making these mysterious phone calls?

35:32.396 --> 35:35.388
- Who do you think sent you this?
- You're telling me it's...

35:35.466 --> 35:37.866
An ex-lover, yeah, out for revenge.

35:37.935 --> 35:41.371
Which one, I couldn't say.
But I deserve it. I deserve much worse.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.503
Not for killing Fey,
that I had nothing to do with.

35:45.576 --> 35:49.034
But for being a lousy husband

35:49.113 --> 35:52.105
and an even lousier father.

35:52.183 --> 35:56.745
And if I can't teach you by my example,
learn from my mistakes.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.551
Stop screwing around.
Settle down, for God's sake.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.795
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.564
Down?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.839
- Sorry.
- I was going to call you.

36:21.913 --> 36:26.213
- No. It... you were saying?
- I just wanted to say thanks.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.715
Thanks? For giving you
the most stressful lunch ever?

36:30.788 --> 36:34.383
I make you eat slimy sea monsters,
then I get you in major trouble with...

36:34.458 --> 36:36.517
It's OK. That wasn't your fault.

36:38.596 --> 36:42.054
- How's that guy who ate all that honey?
- Not great.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.465
I have to make the beer run
instead of him.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.971
We're having a party up on 25
with Human Resources, if you're free.

36:48.039 --> 36:52.032
Oh, I'm... well,
I'd love to go, Henry, but...

36:52.109 --> 36:56.478
- Well, you have a boyfriend.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.984
And I really want to give this thing
with Walter and me a chance.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.486
Is that the guy? With the net?

37:03.554 --> 37:05.749
Yeah. Yeah, but he's
not always like that.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.291
I'm not always like that.
I should have never...

37:09.260 --> 37:11.285
I'm sorry.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.728
No worries. It was just lunch.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.028
<i>Trick or treat, nymphalis milberti.</i>

37:27.278 --> 37:29.746
Hey. You out of here?

37:29.814 --> 37:31.805
I guess.

37:31.882 --> 37:35.147
Human Resources and Accounting
are having a party downstairs.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.847
I thought I might stop by
and drink all their booze.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.283
How about you? Halloween Ball?

37:41.359 --> 37:44.487
No, not in the mood.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.393
- You have a good time, though.
- Oh.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.458
Sorry.

37:52.937 --> 37:57.465
<i>If you get tired of watching Charlie
Brown and the Great Pumpkin alone,</i>

37:57.541 --> 38:00.066
I could come over
and keep you company.

38:02.647 --> 38:05.309
In costume... or not.

38:05.383 --> 38:09.251
I think I just need
to be alone tonight.

38:13.891 --> 38:16.291
Hey, we could just talk.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.955
Probably not.

38:36.647 --> 38:41.516
Justin! Justin, stop already!

38:41.585 --> 38:43.883
There is no twirling
in the Armed Forces!

38:45.423 --> 38:48.654
That kid... we're gonna get
no candy this year.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.889
So I guess you two need to talk.

38:53.964 --> 38:56.296
I don't need to talk.
Maybe she needs to talk.

38:57.868 --> 39:00.496
OK, whatever.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.772
Licorice? Justin hates it.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.213
So does his aunt.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.218
- You got any raisins?
- Other pocket.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.529
I'm sorry I went to lunch.

39:26.597 --> 39:29.395
The key was too fast?

39:29.467 --> 39:32.334
Yeah, a little.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.372
I pushed you. Damn it!

39:35.539 --> 39:38.406
"Carpe diem, Virgo.
Seize the day."

39:38.809 --> 39:42.040
<i>Never trust the horoscope
in the Daily News.</i>

39:43.147 --> 39:46.207
It's just that we just
started dating again, you know?

39:46.283 --> 39:49.548
I know, I know, I know. And, if you
don't want to even do that, I...

39:49.620 --> 39:51.053
No, I do.

39:53.190 --> 39:55.954
So you and, uh... sushi man...

39:57.161 --> 39:59.026
Just you.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.758
Because sushi is exciting.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.561
I know.

40:03.634 --> 40:05.932
Even if it is crawling with parasites.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.908
Sushi is good, yeah.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.570
But so is a nice slice of pizza.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.753
So my kid shows up.

40:27.825 --> 40:29.224
Last thing I need.

40:29.293 --> 40:33.559
You can do miracles to hide your own
age, but damned if you can hide theirs.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.431
So you didn't take this
Jason to the party?

40:37.501 --> 40:39.128
No, I took him to the elevator.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.036
I told him to go back to
his frat house and bob for apples.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.973
What about Bradford and his son?

40:45.042 --> 40:49.706
Marc told me he saw Daniel coming out
of Bradford's office, all seemed well.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.715
Whatever Bradford said to
Daniel put him off his trail...

40:52.783 --> 40:55.343
That's disappointing.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.818
What do we do now?

40:56.887 --> 41:01.824
I think it's time for Fey Sommers
to come out of seclusion.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.661
I smell fresh blood.

41:09.733 --> 41:12.566
[Wicked laughter]

41:12.636 --> 41:15.264
Dad, add more corn syrup.
You're clotting.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.602
You, uh, going out with Walter?

41:20.678 --> 41:23.340
Yeah, I just wanted
to come home first and change.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.215
No more butterfly, huh?

41:26.283 --> 41:31.084
No, it is exhausting being a butterfly.
No wonder they only live two weeks.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.884
Is that true?

41:32.957 --> 41:34.948
It's just something I know.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.353
Is there anything else I should know?

41:42.900 --> 41:44.697
Right, of course.

41:46.704 --> 41:49.172
I was trying to protect you.

41:50.374 --> 41:54.333
I've been using someone else's
social security number for years.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.912
Because I don't have one.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.414
You can't get one...

42:02.486 --> 42:05.182
...if you're in this country illegally.

42:07.424 --> 42:08.891
And I am.
