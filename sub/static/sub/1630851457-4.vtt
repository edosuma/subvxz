WEBVTT

00:53.250 --> 00:54.250
Hmm?

00:55.708 --> 00:56.708
You came.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.833
I must be cautious wherever I go.

00:59.916 --> 01:03.541
Don't worry.
The Empire's eyes won't reach you here.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.875
Have you finished
exploring the planet yet?

01:05.958 --> 01:08.583
-Not yet. It's too interesting.

01:09.541 --> 01:12.500
But I did find something
I'd like to show you.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.041
It doesn't suit you, that mask.

01:18.708 --> 01:19.750
Huh?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.458
Are you comfortable back there?

01:31.541 --> 01:34.208
I'd rather walk, but it's not too bad.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.083
Well, we can't have a bride
with dirty feet.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.041
Where we're going is
far too sacred for that.

01:43.541 --> 01:45.208
I just wish--

01:45.291 --> 01:48.083
I wish my parents could be here
to see this.

01:50.875 --> 01:54.083
I have no doubt
they'll both be watching.

01:54.666 --> 01:58.708
-They're one with the planet now.
-Yes. Along with your parents.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.958
We are the sky.
We are the forest. We are the river.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.916
We are the sky.
We are the forest. We are the river.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.666
We are one.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.416
Magina, may you rise.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.916
This is--

04:27.083 --> 04:31.208
Hey! Wait for me! I want to help!
You're not finished, are you?

04:31.291 --> 04:33.000
Why are you so slow, Sis!

04:33.083 --> 04:37.541
Okay. Just like this.
We're making a path for the fish.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.000
Will this one work?

04:39.666 --> 04:43.583
-Try putting that one over there.
-Okay.

04:43.666 --> 04:44.666
-Yeah.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.583
Those are the planet's memories.

05:10.083 --> 05:13.208
People of this world
have a deep respect for nature.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.000
Their rituals allow them
to live in harmony with it.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.125
Is that what you wanted
to show me?

05:20.416 --> 05:24.625
Only because an old friend
of ours had roots on this planet.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.250
My master.

05:37.166 --> 05:40.666
-So beautiful.
-Yeah.

05:42.958 --> 05:44.541
The sun's rising.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.416
It has been since a long time
before we were born,

05:48.041 --> 05:52.583
and it will keep on setting too,
I suppose, long after we're gone.

05:58.708 --> 05:59.875
I guess so.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.125
The village is just ahead.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.875
This world's been terribly exploited.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.833
The Separatists stripped them
all of their resources, yes.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.416
And all just for war.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.500
That's all that war is,
nothing but loss.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.541
-Surround him!

06:35.625 --> 06:37.291
Be alert! Attack together.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.666
Look out!

06:38.750 --> 06:41.166
-Someone stop him!

07:05.125 --> 07:07.500
All of this seems so wrong.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.958
Celebrations are meant to be shared
with a large group,

07:11.041 --> 07:13.583
'cause if you hold back, you'll be cursed.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.958
Enjoy, enjoy.
Travelers, you too. Drink with us.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.083
Ah, thank you.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.250
You see?

07:20.333 --> 07:23.250
Would you like some too?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.666
Wish it didn't have to be like this.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.166
I know. It's just too cruel.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.833
After this…

07:39.916 --> 07:43.083
It's tomorrow, isn't it?
They'll take her away?

07:43.166 --> 07:44.416
Uh-huh.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.916
When the Separatists left,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.416
you would have thought
that would have been the end of it,

07:48.500 --> 07:49.708
but no…

07:49.791 --> 07:52.666
That only made room
for a different kind of horror.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The Separatists left
their battle droids behind,

07:58.083 --> 08:01.625
but the raiders found them
and reprogrammed them all.

08:01.708 --> 08:04.291
They formed an army of their own.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.583
We couldn't have stopped them if we tried.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.958
They took all the resources we had left.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.958
And what's worse, they wanted
the village chief as collateral.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.541
But his granddaughter
volunteered to take his place,

08:18.625 --> 08:21.083
and they're coming to take her
in the morning.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.083
This drink isn't strong enough.

08:27.791 --> 08:30.125
Stop. What do you think you're you doing?

08:30.625 --> 08:33.375
Apologies. I hope he didn't trouble you.

08:33.458 --> 08:37.791
No. I understand the grief
of the village runs deep.

08:37.875 --> 08:42.500
Imagine being imprisoned by invaders
to save your grandpapa.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.125
Oh, that poor, sweet girl.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.875
May their Magina be connected
to each other for all eternity,

08:48.958 --> 08:50.708
that they'll never be separated.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.416
-This isn't right!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.125
Saku!

08:54.208 --> 08:56.916
Are you really okay with this, Sister?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.250
You shouldn't have to carry
this burden alone. It's wrong.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.625
Some of us are ready to fight!

09:05.416 --> 09:07.041
We've already discussed this.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.333
Not enough.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.458
You may have given up hope, Sister,
but not all of us have.

09:11.541 --> 09:12.833
Saku, you have to stop.

09:12.916 --> 09:15.333
We're going to bring them down.

09:15.416 --> 09:18.875
We'll fight back for our families,
for the village.

09:19.916 --> 09:21.250
Fighting is useless.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.916
The land is on our side!

09:23.000 --> 09:27.250
I've already made my decision, Sister.
Please understand.

09:30.666 --> 09:32.750
What kind of wedding is full of mourning?

09:35.291 --> 09:36.291
Saku.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.250
-Poor Saku.
-I know. Poor Haru.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.000
First her parents, now her sister.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.125
Know something? She reminds me of you.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.125
I know what you're trying to do.

09:55.791 --> 09:59.666
Hmm. It's not as if I care about
that little code of yours.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.333
Why should I pretend to?

10:20.666 --> 10:23.208
Can you feel the Magina as well?

10:23.958 --> 10:25.041
Magina?

10:28.833 --> 10:32.666
If you can also feel it,
I'm sure you understand.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.291
I have a bad feeling about this.

10:36.291 --> 10:39.000
You think I'm being reckless?

10:39.958 --> 10:43.125
What do you think
would happen if they were thwarted?

10:43.208 --> 10:45.916
I don't know,
but it would put my village at risk.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.333
If I go, I'll be able to protect them all.

10:49.291 --> 10:52.458
And… …I won't be alone.

11:31.916 --> 11:33.500
Asu.

11:39.416 --> 11:40.666
We're in this together.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.375
Here they come.

12:12.458 --> 12:13.791
Poor Haru.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.458
Come away from the window, dear.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.916
Are you the village chief's replacement?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.791
Yes. I'm coming with you in his stead.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.250
I like this planet.

12:43.916 --> 12:48.000
You'll serve as collateral
to avoid any unnecessary conflict.

12:48.625 --> 12:53.750
Although, you'll forgive me
if I appear to be overly cautious.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.166
Saku!

13:03.291 --> 13:04.458
-Saku!
-Sister!

13:04.541 --> 13:05.916
We found this.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.125
It would appear my caution
was well warranted.

13:09.208 --> 13:13.041
I can't have anyone trying
to ambush me now, can I?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.375
I'm sorry, Haru.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.958
It would appear that she is the leader.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.125
Please, no!
No one will try to resist you anymore!

13:22.208 --> 13:24.750
No exceptions, I'm afraid.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.291
What?

13:46.875 --> 13:48.916
What's this? Who are you?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.208
-Ow, my hand!
-Lord Izuma!

13:55.291 --> 13:58.916
You can't change
the river's flow by casting a stone,

13:59.541 --> 14:03.791
but live in harmony with nature,
and you'll change together.

14:04.375 --> 14:07.041
The people of this world know that well.

14:07.125 --> 14:11.708
You know that the breath of life
becomes wind and will always respond.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.625
Magina, may you rise.

14:20.291 --> 14:24.125
And may the Force be with you.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.750
What are you doing?
Shoot them! Kill them all!

14:27.833 --> 14:30.708
-Roger, roger.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.875
-Where'd that come from?
-Where are they?

14:32.958 --> 14:34.625
-Ah, there they--
-Wha--

14:34.708 --> 14:38.625
Fire! Fire!
It's only one man. Shoot him now!

14:44.833 --> 14:47.333
-Hey, he's out of ammo.
-Charge!

14:56.708 --> 14:58.083
Oh.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.208
-That thing's coming.
-What is it?

15:02.291 --> 15:03.416
What is this?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.708
Alert! Alert! Alert!

15:18.041 --> 15:19.125
Run!

15:20.958 --> 15:22.833
You cowards!

15:22.916 --> 15:24.125
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.791
Watch out! Haru!

15:29.708 --> 15:34.125
What are you? Some kind of a monster?

15:36.875 --> 15:38.208
I am a Jedi.
