ADULT ADAM: <i> My brother Barry</i>
<i> was the world champion</i>
<i> of the Goldberg house.</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:06.338
<i> Athletics flowed</i>
<i> through his veins.</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:06.739
Sports!

00:06.741 --> 00:09.575
<i> Yep, in our family,</i>
<i> Barry was the undisputed jock,</i>

00:09.577 --> 00:12.845
<i> mainly 'cause</i>
<i> I never disputed it.</i>

00:12.847 --> 00:13.846
Swish, baby!

00:13.848 --> 00:15.381
Holy balls!

00:15.383 --> 00:17.416
It only took 173 tries!

00:17.418 --> 00:19.351
It took Dr. J 200 times.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.154
Don't look it up.
Just take my words as fact.

00:22.156 --> 00:22.955
Calling my shot.

00:22.957 --> 00:25.691
Right-field bleachers.
Give it to me, Adam.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.059
Come on, baby!

00:27.061 --> 00:27.793
<i> He had it all.</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.562
<i> Strength, passion,</i>
<i> and delusion.</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:33.465
Yes! Left field,
which is your right,

00:33.467 --> 00:34.266
so it still counts!

00:34.268 --> 00:37.169
Dude, how do the Phillies
not recruit you right now,

00:37.171 --> 00:38.003
fresh out of high school?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.405
That's what I ask
when I call them!

00:39.407 --> 00:42.174
<i> Truth was, I may have been</i>
<i> a tad responsible</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:43.609
<i> for over-inflating his ego.</i>

00:43.611 --> 00:45.544
Tonight,
we celebrate excellence

00:45.546 --> 00:46.779
on and off the field.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.014
I give you
the William Penn Academy

00:49.016 --> 00:50.549
Athlete of the Year.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.851
Not only is this student
a gifted sportsman,

00:52.853 --> 00:54.887
but he's a born leader,
and, damn it,

00:54.889 --> 00:55.788
I'd follow him anywhere.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.257
Snap some photos
after he calls my name.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.859
Of course, you all know
who I'm talking about.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.628
Ruben Amaro, Jr.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.898
Boom! Yes! Yes!

01:05.900 --> 01:08.634
(EXHALING SHARPLY)
Yes!

01:10.137 --> 01:14.440
Student athletes,
parents, faculty,

01:14.442 --> 01:15.274
and distinguished guests,

01:15.276 --> 01:18.644
I am privileged and honored
to accept this award.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.245
Goldberg, what the hell
are you doing?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.914
I said Rubén Amaro, Jr.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.816
What? How is that
even possible?

01:23.818 --> 01:26.652
Well, he's
an athletic superstar,

01:26.654 --> 01:27.986
and you are our mascot.

01:27.988 --> 01:32.057
Now put on the giant head
and dance for our champ.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.926
(APPLAUSE)

01:38.866 --> 01:40.232
This is bullcrap.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.301
What does
Ruben Amaro, Jr. have

01:42.303 --> 01:43.135
that I don't?

01:43.137 --> 01:45.037
Um, four-year varsity
letterman in baseball,

01:45.039 --> 01:47.239
the home-run record,
and I'm pretty sure he's got

01:47.241 --> 01:48.207
a full scholarship
to Stanford.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.276
Anyone could play baseball.
I play Wiffle.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.212
Yes, the only sport
where the equipment

01:53.214 --> 01:54.146
is sold in a pharmacy.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.181
Well, at the very least,
Coach should recognize

01:56.183 --> 01:56.882
my insane hoop skills.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.917
Sweetie, you're not even
on the basketball team.

01:58.919 --> 01:59.918
'Cause I play street ball.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.888
My flash and pizzazz can't
be contained in a gymnasium.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.823
And don't get me started
on my boomerang skills.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.460
I won't.
I'd like to see
Ruben Amaro, Jr.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.595
chuck a 'rang.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.829
Stupid, selfish showboat.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.599
This night was supposed to be
about Barry Goldberg.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.100
I don't think it was.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.203
But hey,
you'll always be my champion.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.972
That's just worthless.

02:19.974 --> 02:20.472
But thank you.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.808
<i> Barry's dream of becoming</i>
<i> an athletic superstar</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:25.110
<i> was at an all-time low,</i>
<i> but that all changed</i>

02:25.112 --> 02:27.446
<i> when he watched</i>
<i> the biggest underdog story</i>

02:27.448 --> 02:30.149
<i> in Olympic history</i>
<i> on the news.</i>

02:30.151 --> 02:32.317
<i> The story of Eddie the Eagle.</i>

02:32.319 --> 02:33.285
Look at him go, Lucky.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.455
A week ago, nobody knew
who this guy was.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.023
But today, he's a legend.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.559
<i> A legend that would</i>
<i> inspire my brother</i>

02:40.561 --> 02:42.394
<i> on his path to greatness.</i>

02:42.396 --> 02:44.229
Is that guy
wearing his glasses

02:44.231 --> 02:45.864
under his ski goggles?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.032
That's Eddie the Eagle.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.634
He's an actual
Olympic athlete.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.503
How? He looks like a guy
that works at the post office.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.540
Exactly. He's the only dude
from England

02:54.542 --> 02:55.674
to do ski-jumping.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.775
This nobody just walked
right into

03:38.752 --> 03:42.921
Which one of you morons
cranked up the heat to 55?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.289
How is that cranked up?

03:44.291 --> 03:46.491
I'm wearing my
Spider-Man long underwear,

03:46.493 --> 03:48.860
which, yes, feels like
a fun little secret,

03:48.862 --> 03:51.129

in the house.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.865
He's right, Mur.
It's freezing in here.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.434
At least start a fire.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.134
Are you nuts?

03:56.136 --> 03:57.603
You think firewood
grows on trees?

03:57.605 --> 04:01.573
Yes, that's what
trees are. Wood.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.542
Well, keep your hands off.

Oh, no.

Is it 'cause
you're so terrible

04:49.056 --> 04:51.456
No. Wait,
does Murray say that?

Don't tell Murray
you heard it from me, okay?

Of course, Vic.
I permiss.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.204
Did you just say
"permiss"?

Yes! I'll win the gold
at whatever that is!

06:24.685 --> 06:25.650
It's an equestrian event,

08:06.787 --> 08:07.552
Completely abandoned.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.889
I just don't understand
why he won't ask me for help.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.058
This is how Murray's dad
raised him.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.827
Be proud.
Don't ask for a hand-out.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.528
Solve it yourself.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.364
Well, you raised me to offer
support and guidance

08:19.366 --> 08:23.101
and strong-arm anyone
into doing
exactly what I want.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.737
That's what you thought
I meant when I said,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.439
"Follow your dreams"?

08:27.441 --> 08:27.906
Yes.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.374
<i> My dad was too proud</i>
<i> to ask for help,</i>

08:29.376 --> 08:32.911
<i> so my mom decided</i>
<i> to force it on him.</i>

08:34.248 --> 08:34.980
Bevy!

08:34.982 --> 08:35.881
(BELL DINGS)
Hello, Murray.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.517
I see you found the solution
to all your problems.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.620
What am I looking at?
I'm confused and angry.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.255
It's a fa-ton.
A what?

08:43.257 --> 08:44.723
A fa-ton.
Fa-ton?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.091
Fa-ton.
Fa-ton.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.826
Fa-ton?
Fa-ton.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.194
A what?
Fa-ton.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.262
It's Japanese.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.964
It's a couch but also...

08:53.233 --> 08:55.433
a bed!
It's the origami
of furniture.

08:55.435 --> 08:59.471
What is it doing
in the only room
in the world that I like?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.840
Murray, I know
about the furniture store.

09:01.842 --> 09:05.911
I saw Vic in that
tiny little photo house.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.444
It was sad.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.813
Look, I don't need
anyone's help.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.683
And I definitely
don't need a fa-ton.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.685
Just one
(BLEEP) fa-ton.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.753
No fa-tons.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.422
<i> As my dad was refusing help</i>
<i> to sell furniture,</i>

09:17.424 --> 09:20.892
<i> Barry was hoping to sell</i>
<i> Ball-Ball to the masses.</i>

09:20.894 --> 09:22.994
Friends, JTP...

09:22.996 --> 09:25.263
TOGETHER: JTP!
...girlfriend,

09:25.265 --> 09:26.031
ponytail burnouts.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.966
I've gathered you here today
Sup?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.768
'cause you're the
taste-makers of the school.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.669
You know it.
Big time.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.105
We'll eat anything.
I present to you Ball-Ball,
a high-octane sport

09:34.107 --> 09:36.775
of the future,
and it's the coolest,

09:36.777 --> 09:37.943
newest club in school.

09:37.945 --> 09:38.677
What the hell, man?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.178
You told me this was
a Rush Appreciation club.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.013
I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.983
'Cause what we have here,
it's more than a game.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.251
It's a way of life.
I've played it.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.053
They're definitely
overselling it, but it's fine.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.654
I heard I get to hit you
in the testicles.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.789
When do I get to do that?

09:50.791 --> 09:51.690
Love the enthusiasm!

09:51.692 --> 09:53.425
Now, I'm not only
president of this club.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.093
I'm also Ball-Ball
champion of the world.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.597
So I will naturally dominate,
so do not be discouraged.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.598
All right, everyone out!

09:59.600 --> 10:01.700
Ruben Amaro, Jr. has to
break in some new sneakers.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.169
But I signed out the gym
for my new Ball-Ball club.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.370
What is this?
How's it work?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.672
Ah, there's like
a thousand rules.
Too complicated for you.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.208
Bro, it's Ruben Amaro, Jr.
Let him in our club.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.077
Yeah, you want
this to go big, right?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.678
Well, he's the best athlete
in school.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.512
I don't know if it's confirmed

10:14.514 --> 10:15.780
he's the best
athlete in school.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.917
And honestly,
I'm not sure he's ready
to play game like this.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.151
Watch and learn.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.553
Ball-Ball!

10:21.555 --> 10:23.688
Oh, no! He caught it
with one hand.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.856
That's a ball-buster
bonus.

10:24.858 --> 10:28.360
A penalty shot
at Barry's face or nards.
Your choice.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.160
Nards!
Definitely the nards!

10:29.162 --> 10:32.130
Hey, Adam, pal,
maybe ease up
on the rules until...

10:32.432 --> 10:33.298
Ohh!

10:33.300 --> 10:34.799
Sweetie, are you okay?

10:34.801 --> 10:35.767
(GROANING) He
didn't say "Ball-Ball."

10:35.769 --> 10:38.236
This game is amazing!
I'm telling
everyone in school!

10:38.238 --> 10:39.404
Hey, Coach,
I like this club.

10:39.406 --> 10:43.742
Ruben Amaro, Jr. is in.
It is officially a club.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.876
(GASPS) Score!
We did it!

10:44.878 --> 10:46.411
Wait, is this little kid
playing with us?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.213
'Cause maybe
I'll take a rain check.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.648
If Ruben hates it,
I hate it, too.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.682
Actually,
I'm Barry's coach.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.284
No! I don't even know
who this kid is!

10:53.286 --> 10:55.387
Get out of here,
strange child.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.222
But this is our sport.
We invented it together.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.557
Well, sometimes in life,
you make hard choices.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.459
This is an easy one.
Bye, Adam.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.728
No! It's my game, too!
<i> Turns out Barry added</i>
<i> a new rule</i>

11:03.730 --> 11:08.400
<i> to our beloved Ball-Ball...</i>
<i> stabbing me in the back.</i>

11:09.536 --> 11:11.369
<i> Despite my dad's</i>
<i> struggle at the store,</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:14.339
<i> he forbid my mom</i>
<i> from getting involved.</i>

11:14.341 --> 11:16.107
<i> It did not stick.</i>

11:16.243 --> 11:17.509
Surprise!

11:17.511 --> 11:18.143
It's a fa-ton.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.346
I know it's a fa-ton.
We discussed the fa-ton.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.548
Get the fa-ton
out of my store!

11:23.550 --> 11:26.851
I believe it's pronounced
"fu-ton."

11:26.920 --> 11:29.587
(BELL DINGS)
I'll handle this.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.622
Hello, sir.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.191
What fine piece
of luxury furniture

11:33.193 --> 11:34.125
can I put you in today?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.594
Oh. Is that one of those
new futons?

11:36.596 --> 11:39.631
Why, yes.
They're very comfortable.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.832
No. Ignore that thing.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.500
These people
don't even work here.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.568
See, I have
a small condo,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.637
and this would really save
a lot of room.

11:45.639 --> 11:48.173
Not to mention
a lot of money.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.208
Here. Sit down.
Or lie down.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.176
The choice is yours.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.744
Wait,
what if I told you

11:52.746 --> 11:57.082
I have a bed combined
with a small lake?

11:57.551 --> 12:00.452
You see that?
You see how it's gently
rocking me to sleep?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.921
Waterbed. (SIGHS)
Yeah, I don't know.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.955
It seems kind of '70s.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.790
This bed
is so damn relaxing!

12:05.792 --> 12:07.759
Really? 'Cause you
look more agitated.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.961
It's like being
in the freaking Bahamas.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.863
Come on.
Lay down next to me.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.366
Lay your body next to mine
and feel what I feel.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.702
Yeah, I'm...
I'm gonna go futon.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.203
Wonderful.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.239
Vic will ring you up since
he's not doing anything.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.741
(CHUCKLES)

12:22.743 --> 12:25.243
I'm taking
this commission.

12:25.245 --> 12:25.744
We did it.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.545
See what happens
when you accept a little help?

12:27.547 --> 12:29.948
You want to help? Great.
The store is yours.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.583
What are you
talking about?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.885
If I'm not needed here,
I quit.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.520
You can't quit!
You're the boss!

12:35.522 --> 12:38.089
Oh-ho-ho!
Well, now you're the boss.

12:38.091 --> 12:38.857
Well, if I'm the boss,

12:38.859 --> 12:42.894
then I hire you back
as my boss and I quit.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.095
Fine. I'm the boss?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.531
Well, then I'm leaving you
in charge forever!

12:46.533 --> 12:48.800
<i> That day,</i>
<i> my dad wasn't the only one</i>

12:48.802 --> 12:50.702
<i> being beaten at his own game.</i>
Ball-Ball.

Ball-Ball.
Ball-Ball.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.472
Ball-Ball.
Oh!

12:54.474 --> 12:55.707
Damn it!
Rematch!

12:55.709 --> 12:58.076
Maybe I should play
Johnny Atkins or Carla.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.911
You know, make it fair.
Fair?

12:59.913 --> 13:00.512
What are you saying?

13:00.514 --> 13:03.081
He's saying
you suck, Goldberg.
Hit the bricks.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.516
Crazy girl's right,
Goldberg.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.451
People are playing.
Get off the court.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.452
But I'm Club President.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.887
I thought Ruben was.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.387
Good idea.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.790
Ruben Amaro, Jr.,
you're Club President.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.957
But I invented this game!

13:12.959 --> 13:15.927
Dude, you invented
Ruben-Ball?

13:17.731 --> 13:20.031
Well done, Barry.
Well done.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.232
Appreciate the support, bro,

13:21.234 --> 13:22.567
but it's not time
to celebrate.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.703
I'm not supporting you.
This is a sarcastic clap.

13:25.705 --> 13:29.274
What? A sarcastic clap
goes like this.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.710
Which is exactly
what I'm doing, dude.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.046
No, you're doing this.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.482
That's a slow clap
for a champion.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.185
No, that's not a slow clap.
This is.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.686
Oh, my God.
Can't you hear
the difference?

13:41.688 --> 13:44.055
You're not watching
what I'm doing.
Watch what I'm doing.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.257
You're not hearing it!
Hear the patterns.
It's a rhythm.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.625
You've had no rhythm
our whole life.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.693
You're not watching
what I'm doing!

13:48.695 --> 13:50.395
Just look! Just like this!
Aah! Forget the clap!

13:50.397 --> 13:54.065
All I know is, first,
you kick me out
of the game we created.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.968
Then you sucked at it
and lost it forever.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.536
Sucked?
Sucked!

13:58.538 --> 13:59.204
For years, I thought

13:59.206 --> 14:00.972
you were the greatest athlete
on the planet.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.175
Turns out,
you're, like, not good.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.310
Just like me.

14:05.312 --> 14:05.910
You take that back.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.046
Never!
You and me are the same.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.114
That is the single-most
hurtful thing

14:10.116 --> 14:12.183
anyone has ever said to me.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.818
The same.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.158
Don't support me now
with your applause.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.327
It's too late.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.099
Since I left you
in charge of the store,

14:28.101 --> 14:30.501
I thought you might
want to see what's happening.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.503
"Going Out of Business"
sale?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.872
Murray,
that's brilliant!

14:33.874 --> 14:36.641
No, no, since you insist
on running the store,

14:36.643 --> 14:37.308
I'm calling it quits

14:37.310 --> 14:39.210
and really going
out of business.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.679
Hon, furniture stores
do this all the time.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.915
Everybody knows
it's not real.

14:43.917 --> 14:44.582
But it is real!

14:44.584 --> 14:48.620
It's also the same exact ad
you ran three times last year.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.157
What do you think
of that?

14:53.159 --> 14:54.592
It's fantastic!

14:54.594 --> 14:55.260
No, no, no, read it.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.696
It's says "Seriously"
and "For real this time!"

14:58.698 --> 15:00.398
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Gotcha.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.133
Aah!

15:03.770 --> 15:04.636
Ha.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.871
Right here

15:17.884 --> 15:18.683
If I'm so good,

15:18.685 --> 15:20.652
why did you come down
to the furniture store

15:20.654 --> 15:22.587
and mix in?
I was helping.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.755
See, that's
the thing, Bev.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.323
I didn't ask
for your help.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.091
Wait, where
are you going?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.894
Anywhere but here.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.398
Oh, look. Dad's having another
"Going Out of Business" sale.

<i> in the last place</i>
<i> we expected.</i>

16:01.962 --> 16:04.529
Barry, what the...
What are you doing?

16:04.531 --> 16:05.463
Making a bonfire.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.898
I've officially quit
all of sports,

16:06.900 --> 16:08.099
and I'm burning
everything I own.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.602
Canoeing isn't even a sport.
It's a leisure activity.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.904
Not the way I did it.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.139
Goodbye,
extreme canoeing.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.643
And farewell to you,
boomerang.

16:21.448 --> 16:25.116
I mean it!
I don't want you here!
Go on! Get out of here!

16:28.421 --> 16:30.355
Damn you!

16:31.858 --> 16:32.957
Let me live my life!

16:32.959 --> 16:34.759
Dude, what did you
do to him?

16:34.761 --> 16:35.426
Told him the truth!

16:35.428 --> 16:37.695
He's not some champion.
He's a scrub like me.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.065
Dear Lord, man.
Do you realize
what you've done?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.633
Sports are
everything to Barry,

16:42.635 --> 16:43.634
and you just took them away.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.471
Why do I matter so much?
I'm just his brother.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.338
Deep down, Barry knows

16:47.340 --> 16:49.540
that out in the world,
he's not some champion.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.909
But in this house,
you make him feel like one.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.878
I...I do?
Yes.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.580
You idolize him.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.115
That's what
little brothers do.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.616
I didn't realize that.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.019
Good news is that even though
you destroyed him,

17:01.021 --> 17:03.388
you can still
build him back up.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.058
Goodbye,
tennis racquet/air guitar.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.795
Well,
that was my racquet.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.898
But sure,
I'll build him back up.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.467
<i> After crushing</i>
<i> Barry's spirits,</i>

17:16.469 --> 17:19.937
<i> I decided I couldn't let him</i>
<i> throw away his dreams,</i>

17:19.939 --> 17:20.905
<i> or all his sports stuff.</i>

17:20.907 --> 17:23.074
What are you doing?
I threw this junk out.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.177
I brought it back in 'cause
we're not done with it yet.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.512
Come here.
Check out the board.

17:27.514 --> 17:31.049
Forget Olympic glory.
I'm not a champion.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.651
I'm not even Eddie the Eagle.
I'm nothing.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.253
(VANGELIS'
<i> CHARIOTS OF FIRE</i> PLAYS)

17:35.255 --> 17:36.254
Maybe out there.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.456
But in here,
you're Barry the Eagle.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.359
Yeah, maybe you won't be
in the Winter or Summer Games,

17:41.361 --> 17:44.529
but we got
something way better.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.963
I give you...

17:47.634 --> 17:48.833
The Home Games.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.235
The Home Games?
That's not a thing.

17:51.237 --> 17:51.936
Neither was Ball-Ball.

17:51.938 --> 17:55.406
Well, thanks to me,
we lost it to
Ruben Amaro, Jr.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.175
Let him have it,
'cause we now got

17:57.177 --> 17:58.810
seventeen
homemade games

17:58.812 --> 18:01.212
combining
athletic skill, bravery,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.314
stupidity, and karate.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.148
What about boomerang?

18:04.150 --> 18:07.018
Oh, we be 'rangin' bro.
We be 'rangin'.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.020
But only one champion
in this house

18:09.022 --> 18:10.721
can take the gold.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.759
Light the torch.
Let the games begin.

18:18.498 --> 18:22.633
<i> That fateful day,</i>
<i> we hung up our Ball-Ball gear.</i>

18:23.103 --> 18:25.136
<i> Sure, we lost</i>
<i> one absurd brotherly game,</i>

18:25.138 --> 18:30.908
<i> but we gained a tradition</i>
<i> that would last a lifetime.</i>

18:34.047 --> 18:35.746
<i> My brother never made it</i>
<i> to the Olympics</i>

18:35.748 --> 18:38.483
<i> like Eddie the Eagle,</i>
<i> but that day,</i>

18:38.485 --> 18:41.252
<i> he sure felt like him.</i>

18:42.689 --> 18:44.956
(MUMBLES)

18:45.125 --> 18:47.725
What's up?
Morning, sunshine!

18:47.727 --> 18:49.327
It's 11:15.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.095
We just sold six futons,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.131
thanks to you
sleeping so peacefully.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.567
(GROANS) Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

18:56.569 --> 19:01.172
Look, Mur, when I first
opened this place,

19:01.174 --> 19:02.473
business was lousy.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.910
It was so bad,
my in-laws
would buy furniture

19:05.912 --> 19:06.611
they didn't even need.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.647
Every room in their house
had three beds.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.183
Why would they do something
so stupid?

19:12.185 --> 19:13.050
To help me.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.654
That's what family does.
We take care of each other.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.490
There's no shame
in that.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.926
Yeah, well,
it feels like there is.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.862
I know that's how it was
in your family,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.665
but now you're my family.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.735
And this
is how we do it.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.612
Did you...fold stuff?

19:41.614 --> 19:44.315
Figured
you gave me a hand,

19:44.317 --> 19:45.683
thought I could
return the favor.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.187
Look, Murray,
I know selling furniture

19:49.189 --> 19:50.755
is your thing,
and I'm sorry that I...

19:50.757 --> 19:53.691
Oh, no, no, no.
This is on me.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.661
The store...
it's struggling, Bevy.

19:56.663 --> 20:02.433
And truthfully,
I could really use your help.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.737
I never thought you'd ask.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.471
<i> But he did.</i>

20:07.473 --> 20:11.943
<i> For the first time, my dad</i>
<i> broke down and asked for help.</i>

20:11.945 --> 20:15.646
<i> Thanks to my mom,</i>
<i> it really did pay off.</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:17.215
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about family,</i>

20:17.217 --> 20:20.551
<i> they're always there</i>
<i> to pick you up when you fall.</i>

20:20.553 --> 20:21.919
<i> And if you're lucky,</i>

20:21.921 --> 20:26.157
<i> they help you soar</i>
<i> like an eagle named Eddie.</i>

20:26.159 --> 20:27.158
We did it, baby!

20:27.160 --> 20:29.327
Hell, yeah, we did.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.930
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:32.932 --> 20:36.734
I'm one of the announcers here
at our Home Games Competition.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.171
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:40.373 --> 20:43.407

20:45.144 --> 20:48.846
(GRUNTING)

20:49.182 --> 20:52.283
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

20:53.519 --> 20:56.387
Okay, we can all agree
this year's Home Games

20:56.389 --> 20:58.689
was a raging success,
but looking ahead,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.558
I want to legitimize
the competition.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.628
Allow me to introduce
next year's new event,

21:03.630 --> 21:04.729
Can You Feel That?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.097
Like the name.
How's it work?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.065
Yeah, Barry,
how does this work?

21:08.067 --> 21:09.767
Best we learn
by demonstration.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.936
Gentlemen,
raise your bats.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.903
W...wait, what?

21:12.905 --> 21:16.374
On your mark.
Get set. Go.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.143
Wait! Shouldn't I also
have a helmet?

21:19.145 --> 21:19.777
Can you feel that?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.445
Right there, right there.
You feel that?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.447
Nothing? Anything?

21:23.449 --> 21:24.448
Actually, no.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.117
I support
whatever this is.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.420
Hey, Erica! Check me out!
I'm tough and sexy!

21:29.422 --> 21:30.721
