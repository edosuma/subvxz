Quiet! Someone might hear us!

03:24.117 --> 03:25.607
Turn off the lights

03:26.152 --> 03:28.450
I'll get it.

03:31.324 --> 03:32.484
I got it!

03:34.094 --> 03:36.358
Now I can't see anything!

03:36.963 --> 03:39.659
You'll get use to it in
a few seconds...

04:12.065 --> 04:14.226
What is going on up there?

04:16.570 --> 04:17.661
It's him...

04:17.737 --> 04:21.605
If I'll catch anybody out here...
I'll be very surprised.

04:29.349 --> 04:30.577
I wonder...

04:34.254 --> 04:37.485
This should keep a lid on things
for the rest of the month.

04:44.664 --> 04:46.029
Take it off.

04:46.099 --> 04:48.329
- I'm trying...
- Shh...

04:48.668 --> 04:50.295
This is hard.

I wanna get out and play!

05:34.848 --> 05:36.509
Okay creep... gimme.

05:36.950 --> 05:38.349
I don't have any money!

05:38.418 --> 05:40.943
If he ain't got money,
he ain't got nothing.

05:41.921 --> 05:44.856
- You're running out of time , creep.
- No , please!

05:44.924 --> 05:46.858

06:04.611 --> 06:06.977
- What are you doing?
- Put him down.

06:09.649 --> 06:11.617
What are you gonna do to me?

06:15.055 --> 06:16.113
Drop him.

06:16.322 --> 06:17.584
No no no!

06:20.260 --> 06:23.252
Thanks a lot , kid.
We appreciate the donation.

06:39.512 --> 06:41.241
Okay baby , let's go.

- Manzini's Antiques -

07:04.204 --> 07:07.037
Good lord! You smell like
a...

07:07.507 --> 07:08.906
I had an accident.

07:09.676 --> 07:10.904
Come , boy.

07:13.613 --> 07:16.844
We better clean you up
before the flies get.

07:17.717 --> 07:21.153
Captain Manzini, what do
you use for that garbage pill?

07:22.255 --> 07:25.383
- How long have you worked for me , boy?
- Couple of months.

07:25.458 --> 07:28.518
Have I ever forbid you to
touch any of my treasures?

07:29.896 --> 07:32.660
- This is the one exception.
- Yes sir.

07:32.732 --> 07:35.530
Did you get the blood of a toad
and the eye of a newt?

07:35.602 --> 07:38.093
No . There's no catch for
unicorns too.

07:38.171 --> 07:40.935
No wonder there's no magic
in the world today.

07:41.007 --> 07:42.634
You can't get the ingredients.

07:42.709 --> 07:45.234
- Here , try this on.
- A dress?

07:45.311 --> 07:48.303
Only to western life...
This is a dashiki.

07:48.381 --> 07:51.782
Given me by the great african
tribal leader from Tuh-Tuh...

07:52.285 --> 07:55.379
in gratitude for making
his mother-in-law disappear.

07:55.755 --> 07:57.347
You were in Africa?

07:57.423 --> 07:59.721
Actually , I was on my way back from Egypt.

07:59.793 --> 08:02.990
I was doing a split week in
Cleveland and Cairo.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.531
But that's a long story.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.530
Are you gonna tell me what happened?

08:09.903 --> 08:11.803
I got in a fight.
I lost.

08:12.338 --> 08:14.431
Losing is relative , my dear boy.

08:14.641 --> 08:17.405
What matters is conceding with grace.

08:19.712 --> 08:22.272
- Who did this to you?
- Some guys.

08:23.216 --> 08:26.413
Some guys...
Did you reported to the police?

08:26.486 --> 08:30.013
Last guy who snitched on Juice
got poured into the westside highway.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.283
Really?

08:32.826 --> 08:36.956
Which is broth than vampire's broom
make this clothes as good as new.

08:40.332 --> 08:42.028
Let's go do some work.

08:45.205 --> 08:46.638
Do you sell much of this stuff?

08:46.706 --> 08:49.402
We only had 2 costumers,
and they didn't buy anything.

08:49.475 --> 08:53.172
Patiance is a dear divine,
it's their sweet fruit.

08:54.414 --> 08:58.214
That's from the greek ,
it loses something in translation.

08:58.284 --> 09:01.253
Now... let's add a little sparkle
into our merchandise.

09:02.021 --> 09:04.455
Funny people should call it
junk , isn't it?

09:04.524 --> 09:08.187
When every single piece , is a...
is a diary into the human spirit.

09:08.261 --> 09:09.660
Take this , for instance.

09:09.729 --> 09:11.924
"To my darling Mary , From Herbert."

09:12.198 --> 09:15.463
This is not a modern book.
This is a testimony for love.

09:15.835 --> 09:17.029
And this?

09:18.004 --> 09:20.564
Yet the child who slept
with this...

09:20.640 --> 09:22.938
grow up to shake the world.

09:23.009 --> 09:25.034
Tell me about this,
Captain Manzini.

09:25.111 --> 09:27.545
An early form of air conditioning.

09:28.548 --> 09:30.709
Also a tool of romance.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.375
It could backen or to buff.

09:34.654 --> 09:36.349
Did you ever get backen?

09:36.422 --> 09:38.322
Yes . I also got rebuffed.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.984
But , like me , this is a relic
from a simply...

09:42.061 --> 09:44.393
good and bad ,
black and white.

09:44.464 --> 09:48.025
When a man could set all his
differences with one of these.

09:48.368 --> 09:52.930
Then some damn fool invented gun
powder and a bigger damn fool split the atom.

09:53.406 --> 09:56.432
That's when I decided to leave
mankind to it's fall...

09:57.076 --> 10:00.568
and retire here into the world
of...

10:01.814 --> 10:03.611
- Touch'e!
- Dodger , no!

10:08.955 --> 10:12.857
- Have you ever heard of Pandora's box?
- Never heard of Pandora.

10:13.192 --> 10:15.387
Right . Clear this up.

10:16.262 --> 10:19.720
According to legend,
all trouble in the world...

10:19.799 --> 10:24.634
could squeeze into...
one tiny box.

10:25.038 --> 10:26.232
Okay?

10:26.940 --> 10:31.502
Along came nozy little girl called
Pandora , opened it up...

10:33.479 --> 10:35.276
and let them all out.

10:35.448 --> 10:39.714
- I don't understand.
- Think of this... as Pandora's pain.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.627
Look at that!

10:50.063 --> 10:51.428
Look at that...

10:52.532 --> 10:53.999
- It's so pretty!
- Look at that.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.159
- SALE -

10:57.036 --> 10:58.503
What's this thing here?

11:00.106 --> 11:01.630
That's pretty cool.

11:06.312 --> 11:09.406
Tangerine? You got a minute?

11:09.482 --> 11:13.077
- You want to come inside and take a look?
- Why would I want to?

11:15.555 --> 11:19.491
Captain Manzini got great stuff,
well, stuff you can use for your creations.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.719
Come inside.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.099
We got buttons.

11:37.443 --> 11:40.810
We got medals too.
They're really good medals.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.505
Put them on, it's just...

11:43.883 --> 11:46.351
That's great kid.
What do you do for a hardcore?

11:46.419 --> 11:47.909
Open a vein?

11:52.892 --> 11:55.383
We got beads , we got great beads.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.735
We got...

12:23.689 --> 12:25.156
How much is this?

12:34.167 --> 12:36.192
Touch my woman , creep!

12:37.870 --> 12:39.565
No . I was...

12:39.806 --> 12:43.537
Come on , he's just a kid.
Not 12 years old.

12:43.776 --> 12:45.835
I'm 14! I'm almost 15!

12:45.912 --> 12:49.575
He's not worth the beating up!
Forget him.

12:49.816 --> 12:51.841
Come on , let's go have some fun.

12:52.351 --> 12:53.818
I wish I could help you baby.

12:53.886 --> 12:56.252
But the little creep must be
tought a lesson.

12:56.322 --> 12:58.222
It's a matter of principle.

12:58.324 --> 12:59.382
Oh yeah?

12:59.592 --> 13:03.028
I think it's just a matter of you
like to see people bleed.

13:58.017 --> 14:00.645
Yuch! It looks like a glue nose.

14:09.428 --> 14:11.760
You made a monkey out of me kid.

14:27.046 --> 14:28.411
What are you gonna do?

14:28.481 --> 14:31.314
I'm gonna send this little slime ball
on a journey.

14:32.318 --> 14:35.549
Oh come on Juicy baby no...
Let's go play.

14:56.742 --> 14:58.471
What are you gonna do?

15:01.681 --> 15:03.615
Why won't you just leave him alone?

15:03.683 --> 15:05.173
Shut up. Get down.

15:05.251 --> 15:07.048
No! Please don't!

15:09.088 --> 15:10.749
What are you doing?

15:10.823 --> 15:13.121
Why won't you just leave me alone?

15:13.192 --> 15:15.922
Don't touch me!
What is wrong with you?

15:57.803 --> 15:59.430
See you later , creep.

16:11.984 --> 16:14.578
Hey guys!
Turn off the water.

He need a clean bad!

16:18.157 --> 16:20.682
Yeah . You don't smell too good either.

16:21.327 --> 16:23.261
What if he need a doctor?

16:34.907 --> 16:38.343
- FIRST AID -

16:38.411 --> 16:40.311
Hey , got any iodine there?

16:41.013 --> 16:42.105
Let's see.

16:43.949 --> 16:47.441
Yeah . Looks good too.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.456
- No! That's poison.
- Hey! Drink the red , you'll get dead.

16:51.524 --> 16:54.516
Well guys...

16:54.593 --> 16:56.356
Open him up!

16:57.596 --> 16:59.427
This will make him wake up!

17:03.636 --> 17:05.001
Put a cork in it!

17:05.404 --> 17:08.305
Are you okay? You sure took
a bad fall.

17:08.374 --> 17:09.704
What are you?

17:09.909 --> 17:11.433
What are we?

17:12.044 --> 17:14.637
- Same to you , buddy. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.739
Let's go.

17:20.786 --> 17:23.448
Hey , get out of that chair.
It's the captain's chair.

17:23.521 --> 17:25.114
Leave the chair alone.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.050
Stop that please.

17:27.193 --> 17:30.890
Stop it you guys!

17:31.897 --> 17:33.330
You leave me alone.

17:33.399 --> 17:36.732
Put that stuff down , it's not yours.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.173
Put this back! Don't touch this!

17:46.712 --> 17:49.545
My god! It's the garlic!

17:51.517 --> 17:53.109
Put this back!

17:53.185 --> 17:54.982
Please , don't touch this!

17:57.857 --> 17:59.415
What are you doing?

17:59.525 --> 18:02.392
You did this?
How would you like to get stumped?

18:06.899 --> 18:08.491
Here.

18:10.503 --> 18:12.164
This is fun!

18:15.174 --> 18:16.766
My god.

18:17.943 --> 18:19.570
Attention!

18:22.982 --> 18:26.884
You let them out!
You let them out of the garbage can!

18:26.952 --> 18:29.887
- I don't know what happened , honest!
- You don't?

18:31.290 --> 18:34.123
Hi captain , long time no see.

18:37.029 --> 18:39.759
Alright children , we had our fun.

18:40.599 --> 18:43.432
Come on , back into the garbage can.

18:43.502 --> 18:45.993
- No way!
- No!

18:46.772 --> 18:49.400
- That can is jail.
- Yeah!

18:49.575 --> 18:53.033
You are forcing me to lay
very heavy magic on you.

18:54.613 --> 18:55.671
No!

18:55.748 --> 18:59.582
Dodger , I want the tooth of a crocodile,
a bottle of english fog...

19:00.119 --> 19:02.883
a hair of a goat,
the shadow of your smile.

19:02.955 --> 19:05.788
Captain , we can't get that stuff anymore.

19:06.192 --> 19:08.126
That's 20th century progress...

19:08.194 --> 19:09.855
We can put a man on the moon...!

19:09.929 --> 19:13.126
But we can't find a few simple
ingredients to do a magic trick.

19:13.199 --> 19:15.827
Alright... you took them out of
the garbage can...

19:15.901 --> 19:17.129
Say hello to trouble.

19:17.203 --> 19:20.229
Get them into the garbage can!

19:21.841 --> 19:24.901
You all greasy red.
Wanna rumble kid?

No, thanks.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.382

19:48.534 --> 19:50.365

19:59.411 --> 20:01.140
Oh NAT.

20:20.766 --> 20:23.599
And this little green chappy is Ali gator.

20:32.645 --> 20:35.113
An eye ball is keep a doctor waiting.

20:35.180 --> 20:37.205
No thank you . I'm a vegetarian.

20:37.883 --> 20:39.350
How about a finger?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.451
A toe?

20:43.188 --> 20:44.849
Disgusting!

20:44.924 --> 20:48.121
I caused a lot of trouble,
didn't I captain?

20:48.861 --> 20:51.329
Somehow we gotta keep this kids
out of mischief until...

20:51.397 --> 20:53.991
we get them back in the garbage
can.

20:54.066 --> 20:57.524
First of all , we gotta get
you cleaned up. You could do a bath.

20:57.603 --> 21:00.003
No! No bath!

21:00.072 --> 21:01.869
Not you! Him!

21:04.176 --> 21:06.167
Come on.

Don't even think about it.

21:48.587 --> 21:50.350
He's a cute boy.

21:51.957 --> 21:53.948
Tasty looking toes too.

21:58.197 --> 22:02.827
We cannot choose the way we look,
but we can choose the way we behave.

22:05.504 --> 22:07.836
That's totally uncool.

22:10.943 --> 22:14.709
Now listen! Since you won't go back into
the can...

22:14.780 --> 22:16.748
You must at least promise me...

22:16.815 --> 22:18.840
Stay out of the Normis.

22:19.151 --> 22:22.518
- What are Normis?
- Normal people.

22:22.621 --> 22:24.680
We gotta hide from them.

22:25.324 --> 22:26.621
They hate us.

22:26.792 --> 22:28.487
Yeah . They think we're ugly.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.619
Ugliness is not in a mirror.

22:31.096 --> 22:35.465
Ugliness is cruelty, evil of spirit,
greed.

22:36.402 --> 22:39.735
To be blessed with unusual features...

22:40.272 --> 22:41.899
is an advanture.

22:45.244 --> 22:47.075
You think they bought it?

22:48.647 --> 22:51.377
- What a crock!
- Yeah , tell me about it.

22:51.450 --> 22:54.112
You couldn't chose a worst time
to come back.

22:54.186 --> 22:57.053
People are absolutely obsessed
about their looks this days.

22:57.122 --> 23:00.819
diating , joging , having everything
lift including their wallets.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.890
Well , I don't think you're ugly , exactly.

23:03.962 --> 23:06.089
- Wanna suck face?
- No.

23:06.832 --> 23:09.596
Well , I mean ,
I already love somebody.

23:10.069 --> 23:14.199
- Tangerine, now she is ugly!
- She's beautiful!

23:14.273 --> 23:15.968
You ain't gonna get her.

23:16.175 --> 23:17.642

Give me a little shoulder here.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.004
Hi!

24:00.719 --> 24:05.281
Look , I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

24:05.491 --> 24:08.221
You know how Juice can get sometimes.

24:08.460 --> 24:10.553
- Forget it.
- Okay.

24:10.729 --> 24:12.856
Are you going out to meet him?

24:12.931 --> 24:15.092
No , he's got some business
to take care.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.158
I have my stuff to do , so...

24:17.236 --> 24:19.898
Let me help you...

24:20.773 --> 24:21.865
Here.

24:22.608 --> 24:23.870
Yeah.

24:25.010 --> 24:29.174
Well , what I meant was...
where are you going with your... stuff?

24:29.248 --> 24:30.738

24:32.251 --> 24:34.583
You wanna come along and help me?

24:39.691 --> 24:40.715
Sure.

24:46.465 --> 24:48.399
So what do we do when we get there?

24:50.035 --> 24:52.970
What do you mean?
Like , how do we sell the clothes?

24:53.038 --> 24:55.700
Well , you start at the highest price
you can find...

24:55.774 --> 24:58.971
for the clothing,
it may or may not have tags on it...

24:59.044 --> 25:02.104
- What are you doing?
- Calm down . It's under control.

25:02.181 --> 25:06.083
And then , if they won't go for
the price , we go down slowly but not too far...

25:06.151 --> 25:09.086
if they wanna take out more than 5$,
don't sell it.

25:25.037 --> 25:26.800
Hey wait! Tangerine!

25:28.941 --> 25:31.136
- Pretty stuff?
- Yeah.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.872
- Come on girls.
- I got all the stuff.

25:33.946 --> 25:37.814
- Wait wait wait... don't have it like that.
- What? It's still greek.

25:38.517 --> 25:40.644
No , I don't like it much.

25:40.719 --> 25:42.516
Okay , 14 please.

25:43.455 --> 25:45.616
Do you want that? that's 10.

25:47.092 --> 25:49.583
You want that? alright.

25:52.664 --> 25:54.757
Tangerine, you're doing great.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.800
I'm gonna sell my way out of this town.

25:56.869 --> 25:59.861
Someday I'm gonna be a famous fashion
designer from New York.

25:59.938 --> 26:01.530
New York?

26:01.740 --> 26:04.675
Or Hollywood.
They need designer for movies , no?

26:04.743 --> 26:06.404
Yeah , but that's a long way up.

26:06.478 --> 26:10.107
Well , I'm not gonna live at
somebody's cappy basement all my life , that's 12.

26:12.284 --> 26:14.946
- Hey , buy it or drop it.
- I'll drop this.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.783

26:16.889 --> 26:19.016

28:58.316 --> 29:01.717

it makes me irritable.

41:03.674 --> 41:05.665

41:05.743 --> 41:09.076
I got a better idea.

41:10.148 --> 41:12.116
We can't go out.

41:12.283 --> 41:13.807

42:45.643 --> 42:46.667
- Rabbit.

45:02.847 --> 45:05.577
Yeah , this is it.

45:06.250 --> 45:08.047
Must be the place.

45:12.790 --> 45:13.916
Too skinny.

Too bony.

45:16.927 --> 45:18.053
Too leathery.

45:21.899 --> 45:23.764

Let me try this one.

45:58.135 --> 46:00.626
This should do it . Yeah ,

46:46.484 --> 46:48.247
- Sit down and eat.
- Eat.

This movie is making me hungry.

Thanks guys , for bringing them home.

48:28.252 --> 48:29.514

48:30.287 --> 48:31.845
Are you drunk?

48:32.723 --> 48:34.657
- Bye guys!

48:34.725 --> 48:37.421
- What's going on dudes?
- Come on , Ali!

48:41.398 --> 48:42.922
I'm going to the party!

48:45.302 --> 48:49.238

48:50.641 --> 48:53.201

49:34.485 --> 49:37.579

49:40.491 --> 49:44.291
As the natural leader of the children,
you are setting up horrible example.

49:45.829 --> 49:47.592
Thanks . I'm that kinda guy.

49:47.665 --> 49:51.362
In the whole universe , there's only one
place you and the children are safe.

49:51.435 --> 49:54.871
Wether you like it or not,
and that is in the garbage can.

49:54.938 --> 49:58.203
Now , until I can find a spell that
would get you back in there...

49:58.542 --> 50:00.476
You are all in grave danger.

50:01.245 --> 50:04.214
- We can take care of ourselves.
- Maybe so.

50:04.281 --> 50:07.182
Nevertheless,
I want you to swear on a solem oath...

50:07.251 --> 50:10.345
That you will stay out of trouble.
Now , say after me...

50:21.598 --> 50:24.089
And reframe from eating people's toes.

50:27.738 --> 50:30.502
"And reframe from eating people's toes."

50:31.408 --> 50:32.500
Alright.

50:32.643 --> 50:35.134
Now , don't you feel better?

50:36.714 --> 50:38.705
Cap , you're an educated man , huh?

50:38.816 --> 50:41.785
Let's just say I did my outward...

50:42.886 --> 50:46.049
And you take the word of a talking
alligator?

50:46.590 --> 50:49.024
There's no time like no time...

50:49.093 --> 50:52.028
... or any time...

51:02.239 --> 51:06.471
- PRIME TIME TV -
- TOXIC WASTE -
- CITY ZOO -

51:27.664 --> 51:29.529
- HOT TUB -

51:30.834 --> 51:32.324
Brown water!

51:35.539 --> 51:37.131
- Oh no!
- Oh yes!

51:40.577 --> 51:43.341
"Once upon a dragon's tale...

51:43.414 --> 51:44.608
- REALLY BLACK MAGIC -

51:44.681 --> 51:47.172
"sent the kids back in the can"

51:48.318 --> 51:49.649
Oh rats!

51:51.288 --> 51:52.482
Why not?

51:55.793 --> 51:58.785
Rats and thunder wind and hale

51:59.496 --> 52:03.023
Send the kids back in the can.

52:04.635 --> 52:06.000
I don't understand.

52:06.136 --> 52:09.071
It's a basic Mary Poppins and
it's not working.

52:20.959 --> 52:22.859
There's something on his mind.

52:23.262 --> 52:26.095
- Yeah! A girl!
- And it ain't me!

52:26.331 --> 52:28.356
That girl , cut wat...

52:29.501 --> 52:31.196
That's uh... Tangerine.

52:31.870 --> 52:36.239
The world is full of great things,
but then again the chicks mess it up.

52:36.308 --> 52:38.401
- Thanks.
- No!

52:40.913 --> 52:43.848
Besides that girl,
what else is on your mind?

52:44.650 --> 52:46.015
- You.
- Me?

52:46.752 --> 52:48.117
Yeah , all of you guys.

52:48.186 --> 52:50.450
I'm worried about what's gonna happen to you.

52:50.522 --> 52:52.046
I wish i knew.

52:52.124 --> 52:55.218
- We're scared.
- Yeah!

52:55.560 --> 52:58.051
Scared our friends are gonna die!

52:58.130 --> 53:01.190
- Where are your friends now?
- We don't know.

53:01.733 --> 53:03.428
We just can't find them.

53:03.635 --> 53:06.069
We think they might be locked
up somewhere.

53:06.138 --> 53:08.106
In a really terrible place!

53:08.640 --> 53:10.870
In the state home for the ugly!

53:11.043 --> 53:12.601
State home for the ugly?

53:12.678 --> 53:15.078
I can't believe people would
make a place like that.

53:15.147 --> 53:16.409
Neither did I.

53:16.481 --> 53:19.575
I'm ashame to admit I never
tried to find it.

53:19.651 --> 53:22.779
I didn't wanted to believe that
such a place could actually exist.

53:22.888 --> 53:25.482
- Do you believe it now?
- Oh , now? Yes.

53:25.657 --> 53:29.024
I was quite happy to let life go
rushing pass my door...

53:29.328 --> 53:32.195
Closing my eyes to things I didn't
wanna see.

53:32.664 --> 53:35.497
But when you care for someone...
That's it , that's fine.

53:35.567 --> 53:38.001
When you care for somebody,
when you love them

53:38.070 --> 53:39.560
That's enough , Ali!

53:39.938 --> 53:41.838
That brings responsibility.

53:43.241 --> 53:45.869
This means we're gonna find the place?

53:46.378 --> 53:47.845
Settle up , partner.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.407
We're gonna find the home for the ugly!

53:50.482 --> 53:51.744
Alright!

53:56.221 --> 53:57.415
Kid bugs!

54:07.833 --> 54:10.097
Ninty nine , one hundred.

54:13.572 --> 54:16.166
Hey! Let go of me , get away from me!

54:16.241 --> 54:18.368
Oops! Our mistake.

54:18.443 --> 54:21.139
You shouldn't wear a mask
unless it's halloween , kid.

54:21.213 --> 54:22.942
No hard feelings , hey kid?

54:23.048 --> 54:24.515
Go suck a rope!

54:24.783 --> 54:26.944
Yeah...

54:40.565 --> 54:42.658
- STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY -

55:13.698 --> 55:15.928
There it is , the state home for the ugly.

55:18.136 --> 55:20.001
Looks like a prison.

55:20.105 --> 55:22.300
How do we find out
if the kids are in there?

55:22.374 --> 55:25.241
According to the great master Ying Lee...

55:25.577 --> 55:28.068
"The dusk falls like of the black birds' wings"

55:28.246 --> 55:29.736
You mean , we wait until dark?

55:29.815 --> 55:31.578
- Exactly.
- No , I can't!

55:36.254 --> 55:37.721
Give me.

55:47.132 --> 55:49.498
- Here.
- Gimme the ball.

55:52.237 --> 55:53.795
Wait up! I'll be right there.

55:56.208 --> 55:57.698
- Here he comes!
- Yeah!

55:57.776 --> 56:00.108
- He's here.
- I thought he'll forget.

56:01.213 --> 56:02.737
Here's all the clothes.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.483
- Let me help.
- I got it.

56:10.922 --> 56:13.322
- Thanks guys.
- See ya.

57:10.081 --> 57:13.573
So , can you make a lot of those
things for me?

57:13.652 --> 57:15.745
I've got big plans for us.

57:16.087 --> 57:17.349
Us?

57:36.341 --> 57:38.468
Bye baby , I'll see you in a while.

57:43.882 --> 57:47.079
It feels lousy , abandoning
my principles for money.

57:47.152 --> 57:48.744
- Principles?
- Yeah.

57:49.020 --> 57:51.045
Letting the little creep live.

58:15.947 --> 58:17.073
I saw Juice.

58:17.749 --> 58:18.943
Are you okay?

58:20.885 --> 58:21.874
Yeah.

58:24.789 --> 58:25.949
There he is!

58:27.425 --> 58:29.188
Come on. Hurry up.

58:35.700 --> 58:37.133
What's that?

58:39.337 --> 58:42.272
- Get away from me!
- These are my friends.

58:42.674 --> 58:45.905
Those ugly things? Yuck!

58:47.279 --> 58:49.270
Give them a chance! You'll like them.

58:49.347 --> 58:51.941
They made all the clothes
you're so crazy about.

58:52.017 --> 58:54.679
- You bet your toes we did.
- Ali , no!

58:54.919 --> 58:56.477
They made the clothes?

58:56.554 --> 58:57.714
Yeah!

58:58.323 --> 58:59.483
Sort of.

59:00.225 --> 59:01.658
Sorry, Dodge.

59:02.227 --> 59:03.353
Show me.

59:23.281 --> 59:24.441
My god!

59:35.193 --> 59:36.660
Mommy?

59:41.833 --> 59:42.822
Binaca?

59:42.901 --> 59:43.959
- BINACA -

59:49.607 --> 59:50.835
Yuck!

59:58.783 --> 01:00:00.808
Anything?....

01:00:00.885 --> 01:00:03.479
Dodger, baby , I gotta flash.

01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:14.096
Departments stores are gonna give us
a fashion show...

01:00:14.966 --> 01:00:16.866
A whole fashion show!

01:00:18.303 --> 01:00:19.998
Tangerine's!

01:00:20.105 --> 01:00:21.538
Tangerine's?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.705
Well yes, Tangerine's.

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:28.479
That's for professionals ,
So all I'll do is sow my name and use staples

01:00:28.546 --> 01:00:30.411
I mean , you don't have a label... Do you?

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:31.642
No.

01:00:31.716 --> 01:00:35.015
Okay , so let's stand the reason
that we need one , right?

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.512
Yeah.

01:00:36.755 --> 01:00:40.054
- So we'll have to get started.
- Get started?

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:43.492
Dodger, baby , don't keep sounding like an echo.
Catch up!

01:00:43.561 --> 01:00:47.588
Those things... down stairs.

01:00:47.799 --> 01:00:49.562
They gotta start sowing.

01:00:50.535 --> 01:00:53.402
But you gotta promise not to
tell anybody where they are.

01:00:57.842 --> 01:00:59.605
Cross my heart.

01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:49.519
I go for two toes and a finger.

01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:56.731
That was a tension breaker!

01:02:01.639 --> 01:02:03.231
I call.

01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:05.707
You got a poker face.

01:02:08.613 --> 01:02:09.739
Me too.

01:02:15.053 --> 01:02:16.247
What was that?

01:02:19.757 --> 01:02:22.157
Maybe I'll just raise a little.

01:02:23.328 --> 01:02:25.694
Hurry!

01:02:26.197 --> 01:02:28.961
Yuck! Cut that out.

01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:31.601
But I haven't finished the examination.

01:02:31.669 --> 01:02:33.227
Oh yes you have!

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:41.905
You back again?

01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:45.480
We ain't doin' no work 'til
you keep your promise.

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:48.041
You were supposed to help us
find our friends.

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:51.850
- We need to go there.
- We still don't know where it is.

01:02:51.923 --> 01:02:53.015
Yes we do.

01:02:53.091 --> 01:02:54.251
- Who?
- We do.

01:02:54.325 --> 01:02:57.886
Captain Manzini and me... We found
the state for the ugly yesterday.

01:02:57.962 --> 01:02:59.554
And you didn't tell us?

01:02:59.631 --> 01:03:01.326
- You're...
- Hey!

01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:03.128
Don't get crazy.

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:05.997
I didn't tell you 'cause we're
checking how to get in there.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:07.469
That place is a fortress.

01:03:07.539 --> 01:03:10.337
- What can we do?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

01:03:10.408 --> 01:03:12.433
- We'll need a plan.
- We need a miracle.

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:14.375
- Yeah!
- We're working on it.

01:03:14.779 --> 01:03:17.043
And in the meantime , you guys could...

01:03:17.115 --> 01:03:19.845
Getting started with the fashion show?

01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:21.010
Yeah.

01:03:24.956 --> 01:03:26.446
Come on guys , please?

01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:28.355
Can you do it for me?

01:03:29.193 --> 01:03:31.991
- Alright , we'll do it!
- Alright!

01:03:32.063 --> 01:03:34.725
But if you don't check out
the home for the ugly...

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.994
There will be a garbage on your
hands.

01:03:37.068 --> 01:03:38.194
And Dodge...

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:40.433
If you cut out on us...

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:44.534
I wouldn't wanna be your toes.

01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:08.822
Captain , shouldn't we be
sneaking in?

01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:11.299
Captain Manzini never sneaks.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:14.304
He advances the enemy and engaging head-off.

01:04:14.472 --> 01:04:15.598
Good evening sir.

01:04:15.673 --> 01:04:17.334
Nice little puppy you have.

01:04:17.408 --> 01:04:18.875
- WARNING , GUARD DOGS -
- NO TRASPASSING -

01:04:18.943 --> 01:04:20.740
Who are you guys?
What you think you're doing here?

01:04:20.812 --> 01:04:23.007
You gotta get out.

01:04:23.781 --> 01:04:27.046
Absolutely no visitors . You got that?
Now get outta here!

01:04:27.452 --> 01:04:28.646
Move it!

01:04:31.522 --> 01:04:34.355
- Captain , we are retreating.
- Nonsense.

01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:36.859
We are mearly advancing in different directions.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:40.925
What do we do now?

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.165
We fall back and regroup.

01:04:59.717 --> 01:05:02.208
The captain and Dodger are gonna
find our friends!

01:05:02.286 --> 01:05:04.516
They are the greatest , yeah!

01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:11.356
- MCBUNDY'S DEPARTMENT STORE PRESENTS -

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:13.294
- TANGERINE'S -

01:05:27.879 --> 01:05:30.541
Need any more models? I'll be
glad to help.

01:05:30.648 --> 01:05:32.980
Gee , no... We have plenty.

01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:36.015
- Anyway , sweety...
- Valerie.

01:05:36.487 --> 01:05:39.320
Anyway , Valerie,
Models have to be pretty.

01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:46.725
Pretty tall...

01:05:47.098 --> 01:05:48.656
Taller than you.

01:05:49.367 --> 01:05:52.359
Didn't mother ever tell you
not to make faces like that?

01:05:52.437 --> 01:05:54.871
Suppose your face froze ,
and you have to go through the rest of your life...

01:05:54.939 --> 01:05:57.305
looking just like...

01:06:01.145 --> 01:06:03.409
Maybe it wouldn't make that
much difference.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:06.041
But we don't have any mothers.

01:06:06.117 --> 01:06:07.880
Why am I not surprised.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:10.079
Tangerine. Come on, lighten up.

01:06:10.722 --> 01:06:13.555
Dodger, you look so cool tonight.

01:06:14.325 --> 01:06:17.920
Why , I don't even know how I
will be able to resist you.

01:06:18.262 --> 01:06:19.422
Later.

01:06:21.032 --> 01:06:23.159
Dodge. My man...

01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:25.960
Yeah , right.

01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:27.498
Gross.

01:06:28.339 --> 01:06:30.398
We want to go to the fashion show.

01:06:30.541 --> 01:06:33.101
You can't go out . You might get caught.

01:06:33.177 --> 01:06:34.405
No , we won't.

01:06:39.817 --> 01:06:41.045
What's this?

01:06:44.155 --> 01:06:45.520
Ho ho ho...

01:06:45.723 --> 01:06:47.350
We'll go as clowns!

01:06:47.692 --> 01:06:50.286
I don't care what stupid customes
they're wearing...

01:06:50.361 --> 01:06:52.158
They can't go!

01:06:55.733 --> 01:06:58.964
Supposed they are caught and
get sent to the home for the ugly?

01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:02.301
You wouldn't wanna have it on
your conscience , would you?

01:07:03.074 --> 01:07:05.065
- No.
- Of course not.

01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:08.073
So what we're gonna do...
We're just gonna take care of that.

01:07:15.386 --> 01:07:17.149
We're going to the fashion show!

01:07:23.494 --> 01:07:25.962
This is gonna solve the problem baby.

01:07:26.864 --> 01:07:28.161
Lock them in there?

01:07:28.232 --> 01:07:31.668
Right as the show is over ,
We'll rush right back.

01:07:31.736 --> 01:07:33.829
And we'll bring them a treat.

01:07:33.905 --> 01:07:36.703
Pizza , or something really revolting
if they would like it better.

01:07:37.809 --> 01:07:39.299
Where's the key?

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:41.305
Right here.

01:07:43.047 --> 01:07:44.742
I won't lose it.

01:07:53.391 --> 01:07:55.291
We're going to the fashion show!

01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:02.791
The door is locked.

01:08:03.768 --> 01:08:05.565
I can't believe it!

01:08:10.041 --> 01:08:12.703
We wanna go to the fashion show!

01:08:13.477 --> 01:08:15.843
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.243
McBundy's! I can't believe it!

01:08:21.919 --> 01:08:23.910
It's gonna make me a star.

01:08:28.926 --> 01:08:31.224
We worked so hard.

01:08:31.295 --> 01:08:33.354
It's not fair.

01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:38.430
Forget this guy's toes.
They're history!

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:39.627
It's okay.

01:08:45.176 --> 01:08:48.703
Dodger, baby , take my clothes inside
and start sorting them out.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:50.804
I'm gonna go park the car.

01:08:51.448 --> 01:08:53.781
I'll be back before you can miss me.

01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:09.933
I still wanna go to the fashion show!

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:15.434
What is it? It feels so good.

01:09:18.743 --> 01:09:20.142
What can we play?

01:09:21.312 --> 01:09:23.371
Okay , we're playing baseball.

01:09:23.648 --> 01:09:26.139
- Three....
- Great.

01:09:26.517 --> 01:09:28.712
Let's see , now...

01:09:29.453 --> 01:09:31.283
Hey , that's not fair Ali!

01:09:33.124 --> 01:09:35.591
Let me break up the tension around here.

01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:49.305
Son of a witch!

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:50.767
I think I got it!

01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:15.498
Holy toledo...

01:10:16.033 --> 01:10:18.001
We are closed for the day.

01:10:21.672 --> 01:10:23.765
Why don't you come back
in the morning and...

01:10:41.225 --> 01:10:43.750
Alright , I call.
Set them down.

01:10:44.495 --> 01:10:46.463
Oh well , I fold.

01:10:46.564 --> 01:10:48.657
A flush beats two of a kind.

01:10:48.866 --> 01:10:51.300
I guess I lose again.

01:10:51.369 --> 01:10:54.304
Get your hands away from me.

01:10:54.572 --> 01:10:56.130
Not so fast.

01:10:58.642 --> 01:11:00.041
Who cares?

01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:03.303
Some kind of friend
he turned out to be!

01:11:03.681 --> 01:11:05.239
Maybe he's hurt.

01:11:05.416 --> 01:11:07.941
Big bad boys... I'll go.

01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:10.650
I'll go.

01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:13.818
Yeah Greg . Give him a piece....

01:11:14.859 --> 01:11:16.690
Yeah , he'll be hurt for sure.

01:11:16.761 --> 01:11:18.820
Shit! The game was just
getting good too.

01:11:18.896 --> 01:11:21.592
Better be a dumb , 'cause I'm hotted....

01:11:24.869 --> 01:11:26.496
What's going on?

01:11:35.146 --> 01:11:36.408
Hello maam?

01:11:36.547 --> 01:11:39.414
Please , try to get the
order of my dresses right.

01:11:41.352 --> 01:11:42.979
And loose the gum.

01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:52.420
If it's not real... Don't use it.

01:12:01.338 --> 01:12:03.533
Hey , that's great... No!

01:12:04.275 --> 01:12:06.243
Alright , you better wear these.

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.073
I'll get you some new nail polish....

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.308
Oh honey , I hope this is not
your real hair.

01:12:14.652 --> 01:12:16.517
Okay , how's the crowd?

01:12:16.587 --> 01:12:17.747
Full house.

01:12:19.657 --> 01:12:21.682
Not bad for a start.

01:12:29.533 --> 01:12:31.524
- STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY -

01:12:45.316 --> 01:12:47.216
Here's the money , fella.

01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:50.310
You find anymore of them ,
you'll know where to put them.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.686
- So where are we off to?
- The fashion show.

01:13:04.368 --> 01:13:05.630
- TOO OLD -

01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:07.532
- TOO BALD -

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.041
- TOO WEIRD -

01:13:16.213 --> 01:13:18.078
Alright , keep moving.

01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:20.515
Hey , I'm gonna report that to
the authorities.

01:13:26.891 --> 01:13:29.655
- Where are they taking us?
- Come on , come on!

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:33.062
- Get in there!
- Don't push it!

01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:35.090
Get in there.

01:13:35.232 --> 01:13:36.859
I wanna go home.

01:13:39.103 --> 01:13:40.593
In there.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.408
Let us outta here.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.307
- TOO GROSS -

01:13:51.382 --> 01:13:52.906
Hey!

01:13:53.617 --> 01:13:56.245
- TOO HAIRY -
- TOO PALE -

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:01.651
- TOO SILLY -
- TOO CRIPPLED -

01:14:02.226 --> 01:14:04.387
I didn't see any of our friends.

01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:07.356
Do you really think they maybe
locked up in here?

01:14:07.431 --> 01:14:09.865
We can't save them from here.

01:14:10.334 --> 01:14:13.269
Yo Einstein!
We gotta save ourselves.

01:14:29.753 --> 01:14:33.052
They're crying .
You want us to shut them up?

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:35.915
- They'll be gone soon.
- What? Where?

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:44.392
Like a big dump in the sky.

01:15:01.852 --> 01:15:05.083
I'm sure glad I got transferred
out of that laboratory.

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:08.190
Did you see any experiments?

01:15:08.792 --> 01:15:09.986
Yeah.

01:15:10.594 --> 01:15:13.495
Those doctors...
They like to hurt people.

01:15:42.693 --> 01:15:44.684
Children?

01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:46.889
Windy? Ali?

01:15:49.933 --> 01:15:51.594
Oh my god!

01:15:55.306 --> 01:15:57.297
There you go , I found it.

01:16:04.715 --> 01:16:07.843
Why don't you just whistle for your
little friends , creep?

01:16:10.254 --> 01:16:12.245
You double-crossed them.

01:16:12.623 --> 01:16:14.488
No . You did.

01:16:15.492 --> 01:16:17.687
I just gave Juice the key.

01:16:20.064 --> 01:16:22.862
Where are they? Where?

01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:28.668
State home for the ugly.

01:16:37.648 --> 01:16:38.979
Lose him.

01:16:41.185 --> 01:16:43.244
- No!
- Come on!

01:16:47.558 --> 01:16:49.526
That's for coming out for him.

01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:03.398
No!

01:17:52.656 --> 01:17:56.023
If I'll see you around here again
I'll get you your own cage!

01:18:15.179 --> 01:18:17.044
I think they got the children.

01:18:17.114 --> 01:18:19.480
Oh no! We gotta get them out of there.

01:18:22.686 --> 01:18:25.621
Dodger, I think we might
be too late.

01:18:25.889 --> 01:18:29.154
Maybe! But we can still get
the bad guys. Go!

01:18:36.133 --> 01:18:38.533
Tonight McBundy's department store...

01:18:38.602 --> 01:18:41.469

of a truly remarkable young designer start.

01:18:44.942 --> 01:18:48.275
Iconoclastic , rebellious and original.

01:18:49.079 --> 01:18:51.104
Her clothes will make a speak.

01:18:51.715 --> 01:18:53.876
Tangerine's clothes to wear...

01:18:53.951 --> 01:18:57.785
When one simply doesn't know what
to wear to occasions which...

01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.290
It doesn't matter
what one wears.

01:19:06.396 --> 01:19:09.729
"Our designer star Tangerine...

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:12.592

01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:15.832

"?? by peach pit and....

01:19:28.585 --> 01:19:32.919
Tonight I would like to show you
a totally new concept to new fashions.

01:19:33.524 --> 01:19:36.493
A little flashy , a little trashy...

01:19:37.361 --> 01:19:38.487
but fun.

01:19:44.334 --> 01:19:47.633
Guys , I need your help right now.
Really , I need your help.

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:49.672

01:21:42.052 --> 01:21:43.178
How?

01:21:44.655 --> 01:21:46.452
We'll think of something.

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.383
Who are you? What are you doing here?

01:21:49.459 --> 01:21:51.120
I am the great Manzini.

01:21:57.768 --> 01:21:59.065

01:23:05.569 --> 01:23:07.969
Alright!

01:23:12.008 --> 01:23:13.805
Hey , this thing...

01:23:13.877 --> 01:23:15.936
Will help him fall down.

01:23:16.113 --> 01:23:17.740
Let's go , hurry! Hurry!

01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:22.709
Let's go find the others.

01:23:23.887 --> 01:23:25.184
I don't see them.

01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:26.411
- TOO SHORT -

01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:28.651
Where can they be?

01:23:35.332 --> 01:23:36.856
Dodge, how are you doin'?

01:23:36.933 --> 01:23:39.163
Captain , what about all of the
other children?

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:42.363
Remember the garbage truck?

01:23:42.706 --> 01:23:44.139
We were too late.

01:23:44.207 --> 01:23:46.402
Just go and check out
that everybody else is out and safe.

01:23:46.476 --> 01:23:48.068
- Okay.
- Let's go guys.

01:23:49.946 --> 01:23:51.470
We're free! Yeah!

01:23:55.552 --> 01:23:56.610
Alright.

01:24:02.392 --> 01:24:03.381
Come on.

01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:13.766
Here we go...

01:24:16.773 --> 01:24:18.468
Watch the tail...

01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:23.772
We blasted them.

01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:42.029
Hey , it's okay , everybody's out!

01:24:44.234 --> 01:24:45.963
Alright!

Hey guys , thanks a lot!

01:24:55.812 --> 01:24:56.904
Thank you.

01:24:57.214 --> 01:24:59.273
- Now , are we all here?
- Yeah!

01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:01.374
Good . Let's get back to the store.

01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.884
- No way.
- No!

01:25:02.953 --> 01:25:05.854
We wanna go to the fashion show
and squeeze us some juice.

01:25:05.922 --> 01:25:07.981
We're tired of being losers.

01:25:08.058 --> 01:25:09.958
It his toe time.

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:13.725
Well , on the one hand , Juice
is dangerous.

01:25:15.031 --> 01:25:18.990
But on the other hand , seems
too pitty to quit while we're on a roll.

01:25:32.816 --> 01:25:35.876
"Wow , what good would they look....

01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:40.887
"Sandy in a sexy....

01:25:40.957 --> 01:25:44.552

01:25:48.565 --> 01:25:51.500
"guarantee the love of the audience"

01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:03.977
As soon as you cross the border ,
get it to the warehouse.

01:26:04.948 --> 01:26:06.279
Yo , captain.

01:26:06.516 --> 01:26:08.711
Remember this is our fight.

01:26:09.686 --> 01:26:10.914
Yeah.

01:26:27.103 --> 01:26:28.161
Careful.

01:26:46.389 --> 01:26:49.381
"And here we have another black skirt...

01:26:49.459 --> 01:26:51.427
"with a zebra spots...

01:26:56.232 --> 01:26:58.291

"wow , what a gift....

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:10.043
Please bear with me , there's
been a slight mistake.

01:27:10.347 --> 01:27:12.542
Would someone will straighten
this up please?

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:14.912
"Here we have..."

01:27:14.985 --> 01:27:16.282
Where are we?

01:27:16.386 --> 01:27:18.581
"With a blue bag and...."

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:20.222
Normis!

01:27:27.564 --> 01:27:28.724
Gimme that!

01:28:01.564 --> 01:28:04.226
You're ruining my fashion show.
Do you understand that?

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.359
Get away from my clothes!

01:28:06.436 --> 01:28:09.234
They're our clothes! They're ours!

01:28:14.511 --> 01:28:15.671
Help!

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.438
Gimme that!

01:28:26.089 --> 01:28:28.148
Those creatures were sure ugly!

01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:31.293
Oh yeah? I'll show you ugly!

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.570
Let's get outta here.

01:28:55.618 --> 01:28:57.449
Get her!

01:29:01.224 --> 01:29:03.658
Go ahead! Make my day!

01:29:05.328 --> 01:29:07.922
- Oh!
- Take it out!

01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:38.950
Let's go.

01:29:39.295 --> 01:29:40.626
Get him.

01:29:45.101 --> 01:29:47.035
Come on!

01:29:57.714 --> 01:29:59.375
Get it , tough guy.

01:29:59.849 --> 01:30:02.079
Come on , let's get out of here.

01:30:04.387 --> 01:30:06.548
Come on Dodger.

01:30:09.792 --> 01:30:11.054
Got away!

01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:34.347
He's not worth it!

01:30:58.508 --> 01:30:59.600
I'm sorry.

01:31:00.176 --> 01:31:01.336
Me too.

01:31:03.446 --> 01:31:07.280
Look , the fashion was a big success.

01:31:08.084 --> 01:31:09.881
I mean , you're a hit.

01:31:11.454 --> 01:31:12.682
And this clothes...

01:31:14.123 --> 01:31:15.488
They're not mine.

01:31:16.326 --> 01:31:17.452
They are now.

01:31:18.828 --> 01:31:21.456
Look , maybe we can just be friends.

01:31:21.531 --> 01:31:24.056
Maybe we can do fun things together.

01:31:25.101 --> 01:31:26.432
No thanks.

01:31:29.205 --> 01:31:31.105
I don't think you're pretty anymore.

01:31:51.361 --> 01:31:55.263
And then I realized I had the
answer all along.

01:31:55.698 --> 01:31:59.566
Now I know you hate the thought
of going back into the can...

01:32:00.036 --> 01:32:02.504
But believe me , it's for your
own good.

01:32:02.872 --> 01:32:05.397
Dodger, bring that garbage can closer.

01:32:06.442 --> 01:32:10.503
Now children , I want
you to close your eyes and concentrate.

01:32:11.547 --> 01:32:14.675
Now this is your song played forth...

01:32:16.586 --> 01:32:19.783
However , when I play the song backwards...

01:32:19.856 --> 01:32:23.917
You will be drawn irresistibly
back into the garbage can.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.787
- Yeah...
- Are you ready?

01:32:26.562 --> 01:32:28.553
Close your eyes and concentrate.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.392
That's our chance...

01:32:32.468 --> 01:32:33.594
Let's go!

01:32:36.039 --> 01:32:38.507
- Let's go.
- Come on , Valerie.

01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:43.840
Dodger, this is no time to argue...
I shall miss them too.

01:32:44.113 --> 01:32:46.547
Think how peaceful it would be.

01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:49.083
We're nearly there.

01:32:49.919 --> 01:32:51.511
Yes , I can feel it working.

01:32:52.155 --> 01:32:56.455
- Here we go!
- Bye , children.

01:33:08.504 --> 01:33:10.335
Hang on captain , I got you.

01:33:11.607 --> 01:33:15.475
Don't worry, Dodger.
I've been stuck in tighter places than this.

01:33:17.547 --> 01:33:19.913
Damn it! I lost them!

01:33:20.249 --> 01:33:23.980
Losing is relative. What's important
is conceding with grace.

01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:33.523
Go Windy!

01:33:33.596 --> 01:33:35.359
...???

01:33:40.603 --> 01:33:44.664
Well , perhaps it would be safer to lock
them away from the world...

01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:46.504
But as you taught me , Dodger...

01:33:46.576 --> 01:33:50.034
You can't change the world by
locking yourself from it.

01:33:50.747 --> 01:33:52.544
Bye!

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.787
Away we go!
