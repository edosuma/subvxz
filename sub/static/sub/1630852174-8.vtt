Candy:
Listen, listen!

00:07.590 --> 00:09.801
Santa and the Board
are corrupt!

00:09.884 --> 00:12.971
This is going to end
starting here and now!

00:13.054 --> 00:14.139
And I have a plan!

00:14.222 --> 00:15.598
-(all cheering)
-Cookie: Yes, Candy!

00:15.682 --> 00:18.226
That's my best friend. Mine.

00:18.309 --> 00:22.147
Together, we are gonna burn
this mother to the ground!

00:22.230 --> 00:25.442
(all cheering)

00:25.525 --> 00:28.111
We can force them to change

00:28.194 --> 00:30.363
because we are
stronger together.

00:30.447 --> 00:34.534
So, the plan is...
dramatic pause, drum roll...

00:34.617 --> 00:36.035
-a walkout!
-Crowd: Ahh.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.328
On Christmas Eve,

00:37.412 --> 00:39.622
right before
the sleigh takes off.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.626
Then, we will show
Santa and everyone

00:43.710 --> 00:46.629
we are the ones who
make Santa Inc. run.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.258
-Without us,
Christmas is nothing!
-(all cheering)

00:50.341 --> 00:51.468
I knew you'd
be into that.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.762
(chuckles)
And I call this plan

00:53.845 --> 00:55.930
Operation Santa Stink.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.140
(confused grumbling)

00:57.223 --> 00:59.851
Get it? 'Cause instead
of "Inc.," it's "stink."

00:59.934 --> 01:01.770
God, Jesus, you
guys are so picky.

01:01.853 --> 01:05.648
What about...
Operation Fuck Santa?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.525
(all cheering)

01:07.609 --> 01:09.194
-Fuck Santa!
-Fuck him!

01:09.277 --> 01:12.197
Now listen to Candy.
You did once before.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.656
Thanks, Mrs. C.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.951
Now everyone,
for the next month,
act normal.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.662
Get ready for Christmas Eve
like every other year.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.373
We can't let
upper management
find out our plan.

01:22.457 --> 01:26.878
The element of surprise
is everything, like this!

01:26.961 --> 01:29.297
(crowd cheers and whistles)

01:30.423 --> 01:33.051
(joyful music playing)

01:42.101 --> 01:44.437
Jingle Jim,
I need you to go back
to work this month

01:44.521 --> 01:46.648
and make sure
Santa stays oblivious.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.525
-You think you can do that?
-Uh, duh.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.736
Keeping Santa in the dark
is my number one skill.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.154
He still doesn't know
about the weekend

01:53.238 --> 01:54.781

in his office.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.199
What do you need
me to do, Candy?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.910
(gasps)
Ooh, can I be
one of those

who has to have sex
with all the bad guys,

02:03.289 --> 02:05.333
so they'll stop being bad?

02:05.416 --> 02:07.877
Well, in a sense... yes.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.463
Fuck yes! A new season
of "Leprechaun Kitchen"!

02:10.547 --> 02:11.798

When Christmas Eve is done,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.561
you'll come back to me
and the Thirsty Deer, right?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.313
Because... I...

02:28.398 --> 02:30.900
-I love you.
-(chuckles) Oh!

02:30.984 --> 02:35.363
Oh my. How, uh...
how... super.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.906
Oh, okay.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.158
So, you don't
love me back.
That's cool.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.368
My ego can handle it.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.911
I'm sorry, Dave-Pierre,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.663
I'm just figuring
out who I am

02:43.746 --> 02:46.291
after years as
a powerful man's wife.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.917
I think I just
need to explore

02:48.001 --> 02:51.170
what it means
to be just Leonard.

02:51.254 --> 02:55.341
You rejecting me
to reclaim your autonomy
is so fucking hot, Leonard.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.678
But, just know,
I would love,
to one day...

02:58.761 --> 03:01.306
-put a baby in there.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.474

03:03.558 --> 03:05.560
I'm almost 80.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.275
What the fuck?
Eamon's going home?

03:12.358 --> 03:13.776
His cabbage and mash
was the shit.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.778
That looked delicious.
Did you see his plating?

03:15.862 --> 03:17.614
I know,
but Shannon's
soda bread

03:17.697 --> 03:19.365
was the best
Chef ever had.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.783
Fuck Shannon

03:20.867 --> 03:23.620
I don't care how
many Michelin Clovers
that asshole has.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.996
He's a pretentious prick.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.999
Baby!

03:28.082 --> 03:31.085
You're back! Mmm.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.172
Hi...
I used your moisturizer.
Uh, is that all right?

03:34.255 --> 03:37.383
Nick!
Is Devin, uh,
living here?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.593
Of course not! No!

03:38.676 --> 03:40.178
(softly):
Go, Devin. Leave.
Beat it, kid.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.056
"Kid"?
What happened to "Dr. D."?

03:43.139 --> 03:45.308
I'm sorry, I don't
have anywhere to go.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.143
My parents can't
handle all the paparazzi.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.437
-It's fine. You can stay.
-Cool!

03:50.521 --> 03:52.690
Let me just say,
I am so sorry.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.234
I'm sure you
wanna have a big talk
about all your issues,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.070
which is obviously great,

03:57.153 --> 03:58.655
and exactly
what I wanna do.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.950
Actually,
I'm pretty exhausted.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.744
Can we not
do the whole
relationship talk

04:04.827 --> 04:06.996
-(chuckles) right now?
-Yes, yes, of course!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.540
Whenever is good for you,
and if that means not ever

04:09.624 --> 04:11.334
rehashing every inch
of our relationship,

04:11.417 --> 04:12.585
which I'm totally
happy to do,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.671
then, let's not
do that, ever.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.006
Oh my god.
Oh god.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.050
You know,
I am aware...
(sniffs)

04:19.133 --> 04:21.010
that you, probably,
fucked that bartender,

04:21.094 --> 04:22.470
but if that
means we get
to eat cupcakes,

04:22.553 --> 04:24.347
I am--
I am okay
with that.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.848
Yeah!
And, hey,

04:25.932 --> 04:27.850
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about,

04:27.934 --> 04:29.686
but I like
this setup.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.980
Should we order wings,
and play Never Have I Ever?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.898
Oh. (chuckles)

04:33.982 --> 04:36.025

We're back!

04:53.001 --> 04:55.336
And, this time,
we're living
here forever.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.171
(sarcastically):
You squandered all the money?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.340
Shocking.
I should've put money on that.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.177
No, we missed you,
Candy the Cynic.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.303
Yeah, we did.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.722
And we squandered it.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.056
Except for what
we used on that

09:55.469 --> 09:58.347
(gasps)
Ahh!

09:58.431 --> 10:01.684
(joyful music plays)

10:01.767 --> 10:03.144
Today is your big day,

10:03.227 --> 10:06.230
since you'll most likely never
find someone to marry you.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.650
I can't wait
‘til you open it.
It's a hat.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.570
Oh my god...
Dad's coal miner hat?

10:12.653 --> 10:15.364
Yes, your father is
lookin' down on us,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.325
and is very proud of you,

10:17.408 --> 10:18.576
but if I know him...

10:18.659 --> 10:20.745
stop staring
at my tits, Dave!

10:20.828 --> 10:22.705
You said you
buried this with Dad.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.041
Wait, I've seen this
before but upside down.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.460
Oh, you keep
your dildos in this,

10:27.543 --> 10:30.463
but I mean... thank you.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.715
Tony:
Got a little somethin'
in my eye here.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.718
I can feel you
picking my pocket.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.136
Junior:
I'm the leader of the sleigh.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.804
I can be late,
like a fuckin' boss,

10:38.888 --> 10:40.973
but I can't be
actually late!
Jesus!

10:41.057 --> 10:44.644
Any idiot knows you take
the desolate back roads
on Christmas Eve.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.563
-What's wrong with you?
-This mornin' at breakfast,

10:47.646 --> 10:51.108
my wife told me
she was in love
with a woman.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.069
-This shit is insane.
-It's actually not.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.906
-She was a lesbian when we met.
-Ahh! Fuck you, Penguin!

10:56.989 --> 10:58.699
I wasn't done
speakin' to you.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.576
(horns honking)

11:00.659 --> 11:02.328
(car radio plays)

11:02.411 --> 11:04.288
-(phone beeps)
-Oh fuck!

11:08.542 --> 11:10.211
-(thud, tires screeching)
-Ahh!

11:10.294 --> 11:12.296
(horn blaring)

11:19.303 --> 11:22.306
Oh fuck, oh fuck,
oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.020
Junior?

11:28.104 --> 11:30.314
(grunting)

11:33.609 --> 11:34.777
I didn't see you.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.612
No shit, you stupid asshole!

11:36.695 --> 11:38.280
Women drivers should be shot!

11:38.364 --> 11:42.076
(gasps)
My nose! My fucking nose!
Get me help!

11:42.159 --> 11:44.912
-I will. Let me just--
-Learn how to not
be a dumb shit?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.205
Impossible! Now, come on!

11:46.288 --> 11:50.418
Move yo' ass!
Ow! Ah! Ah, shit!

11:50.501 --> 11:52.253
Take your little
bitch elf digits,

11:52.336 --> 11:54.088
and call
a fuckin' ambulance.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.714
Move faster!

11:55.798 --> 11:59.301
I'm suffering,
you insufferable
idiot elf!

12:01.470 --> 12:03.556
Come on! Do something!

12:04.515 --> 12:05.891
I'm really hurt!

12:05.975 --> 12:07.726
I realize that...

12:07.810 --> 12:09.645
you fucking caribou.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.815
T-Then, why aren't
you callin' for help?

12:14.442 --> 12:16.944
I'm, I'm sorry.
You're not a loser.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.195
You're so fuckin' hot.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.823
Once they stitch me up,
I will totally fuck you.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.908
Now go and call, please!

12:22.992 --> 12:25.953
(coughing)

12:29.623 --> 12:32.501
I hate... you.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.627
(grunts)

But, Cookie,
why are you here?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.395
I thought you were supposed
to be loading up the sleigh?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.855
Nope, I quit today.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.233
I'm officially
a stay-at-home

13:37.316 --> 13:38.484

13:41.946 --> 13:44.406

something really bad,

15:16.123 --> 15:18.459
- Health care is a...
-Workers: Right!

15:18.542 --> 15:20.419
Maternity leave is not...

15:20.502 --> 15:21.837
A vacation!

15:21.920 --> 15:23.172
Hazard Pay...

15:23.255 --> 15:24.298
Is earned!

15:24.381 --> 15:25.883
Santa and the Board can...

15:25.966 --> 15:28.302
Workers:
Suck our dicks!

15:29.762 --> 15:32.097
Look, I know you all have
a lotta gripes with me,

15:32.181 --> 15:33.515
and how I run Santa Inc.,

15:33.599 --> 15:37.227
but are you so out
to just fuck me

15:37.311 --> 15:39.980
that you would destroy Christmas
for millions of children--

15:40.064 --> 15:42.524
Okay, enough!
You're not gonna
manipulate me again!

15:42.608 --> 15:44.610
No way!
What about the kids--

15:44.693 --> 15:47.404
What about the kids
of the people who work
for your company?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.823
You've been screwing
them for generations!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.909
So, so, no, don't
give me that kid crap.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.452
You don't
care about kids.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.912
You care
about yourself.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.288
You don't know what
you're talking about.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.083
You know, I didn't.
But now I do.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.001
I know everything, Santa.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.711
I know everything.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.089
About the meth,
and the bribes,

16:05.172 --> 16:07.174
and the payoffs
to coal families,

16:07.257 --> 16:10.511
and the illegal titanium
exported from arms dealers

16:10.594 --> 16:13.764
in the Middle East to use
in your lap implants.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.974
That's a lie!
What are you even
talkin' about?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.310
Are you high right now?
You look really high right now.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.646
Your pupils are
huge and tiny
at the same time,

16:20.729 --> 16:21.855
and you look fucked!

16:21.939 --> 16:24.733
I know I'm right,
and I can go right now,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.819
and tell the press,
tell everyone,

16:26.902 --> 16:28.278
and you will go down in history

16:28.362 --> 16:32.408
as the most corrupt
Santa who has ever lived.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.412
Or... you can agree
right now to meet
the workers' demands.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.623
Maternity leave,
coal miners
retirement pensions,

16:39.707 --> 16:42.876
not to mention
the lack of any real
health care system.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.087
And if you finally
address these issues,

16:45.170 --> 16:48.966
I can agree to keep
my mouth shut about
your real legacy.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.217
It's up to you.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.094
This isn't about them, Candy.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.345
This is about you.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.972
Pfft, you're so wrong.

16:55.055 --> 16:59.351
Well, take it from someone
who knows, one day, it will be.

16:59.435 --> 17:04.022
All:
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Santa Claus has got to go!

17:04.106 --> 17:09.069
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Santa Claus has got to go!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.697
Everyone!
Santa and I have spoken.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.324
Turns out,
he's a reasonable man,

17:14.408 --> 17:16.869
and he's agreed to our demands!

17:16.952 --> 17:18.203
(cheering)

17:18.287 --> 17:21.165
He agreed to implement
maternity leave.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.292
-(cheering)
-What the fuck?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.835
And I missed out on it?

17:24.918 --> 17:27.463
Oh well,
I guess Chubby Brenda
can come clean now.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.341
Everyone!
Brenda's not chubby!
She's having twins!

17:31.425 --> 17:32.509
(cheering)

17:32.593 --> 17:35.721
He agreed to give
the coal miners a fair pension,

17:35.804 --> 17:39.391
so they can retire with
the dignity they deserve.

17:39.475 --> 17:43.145
Lumpy,
now you can afford
those dick implants!

17:43.228 --> 17:46.815
No more stuffin'
penny rolls down
your Speedo!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.233
Congrats, Lumpy!

17:48.317 --> 17:51.570
And congrats to all
of you because we did it!

17:51.653 --> 17:55.157
And now, we will finally
be treated fairly...

17:55.240 --> 17:56.658
(cheering)

17:56.742 --> 17:59.161
which is why we need to...

17:59.244 --> 18:02.080
abort Operation
Fuck Santa Claus,

18:02.164 --> 18:06.585
get back to work,
and make this the best
Christmas ever.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.296
(confused chatter)

18:10.422 --> 18:12.174
I know this seems confusing.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.760
Walking out just so
we can walk back in?

18:14.843 --> 18:18.388
I mean, uh, what kind
of nutty protest is this?

18:18.472 --> 18:21.517
But Santa agreed
to our most basic demands,

18:21.600 --> 18:25.687
so I'm confident more
change is on the horizon.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.606
And when you really
think about it,

18:27.689 --> 18:30.150
you know, when you're a kid,
there's only one day a year

18:30.234 --> 18:32.569
more special than any other day.

18:32.653 --> 18:36.532
One day where you get
presents just for being you.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.493
Even if on other days
your mom snaps at you,

18:39.576 --> 18:41.245
or your brother is annoying,

18:41.328 --> 18:45.749
or... or your dad never
makes it home from work.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.876
There's one day

18:47.960 --> 18:52.214
when the world smiles down,
and says, "You matter, kiddo."

18:52.297 --> 18:53.966
And that day is Christmas.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.718
And we are the magic
behind that day.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.305
And, to me...
that's pretty fuckin' huge.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.891
So, come on, guys!
Let's get back to work,

19:02.975 --> 19:06.395
and get these fuckin' kids
some fuckin' presents!

19:06.478 --> 19:12.025
- Feliz Navidad, motherfuckers!
-(all cheering)

19:12.109 --> 19:16.321
Lookin' good, guys.
Stacks go by continent,
you know, there you go!

19:16.405 --> 19:19.199
Uh, so is this when
I give the pep talk
to the reindeer?

19:19.283 --> 19:20.492
That, that happens
tonight, right?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.036
It's that time.
How you feelin', champ?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.538
I guess, okay.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.040
Um... I'm so nervous
I wish I was dead,

19:27.124 --> 19:29.209
-but, otherwise, I'm fine.
-Yeah, okay, well,

19:29.293 --> 19:30.836
maybe, don't worry
about that right now.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.088
Just, you know,
enjoy the ride.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.340
Woo, woo, woo,
woo, woo, woo!

19:35.424 --> 19:39.511
Yeah! Hello A-Team!

19:39.595 --> 19:42.097
-You all good?
-No, idiot, we're wiped out.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.308
I've never felt
so tired in my life.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.475
And Junior's missing.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.603
Wait, what?!
Junior is missing?

19:47.686 --> 19:48.979
I--
Where could he be?

19:49.062 --> 19:49.938
That, that's crazy!

19:50.022 --> 19:51.523
How-- Who could
see that coming?

19:51.607 --> 19:53.442
Hello?
Is there a problem?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.027
Junior is missing!

19:55.110 --> 19:57.029
It's bad!
It's really, really bad!

19:57.112 --> 19:59.823
Just stop panicking, Devin!
Ugh, chill out!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.034
-(Devin crying)
-But this seems bad!

20:02.117 --> 20:03.952
Is it bad?!
It seems really bad!

20:04.036 --> 20:05.787
It's okay. You guys
get on the sleigh.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.290
We have systems
in place to handle this.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.338
-You're up, bitch.
-What?

20:14.421 --> 20:17.299
Junior isn't here.
We don't have time
to wait for him.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.844
No one's more capable
to lead that sleigh
than you, Goldie.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.429
And that goes
for all of you.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.306
You've been
training hard
all year.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.142
The A-Team doesn't
have the strength
to do it this year,

20:27.225 --> 20:30.437
but you guys do!
So, come on!
It's go time!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.981
Yes, ma'am, bitch!

20:33.065 --> 20:34.858
-Oh, what a relief.
-I couldn't have made it.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.444
Jesus, I could
sleep for a year.

20:37.527 --> 20:40.989
-You're gonna do great.
-Thanks. I love you.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.366
But, hey, what
about the light?

20:42.449 --> 20:45.702
Junior leads the sleigh
with the glow from his nose.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.167
This really means
the world to me.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.835
Is it supposed
to smell like dildos?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.630
That's on purpose.
Now kick ass up there, bitch.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.049
Ah! Goldie!
Oh my god!

20:59.132 --> 21:01.051
Your dream is
coming true!

21:01.134 --> 21:03.220
And we all love
each other again!

21:03.303 --> 21:05.514
Ah, my girls,
my sisters.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.265
The big three,
we're back, baby!

21:07.349 --> 21:12.354
(cries)
This is a beautiful
moment for friendship.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.272
I love you guys,
but can we do this tomorrow?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.316
I gotta go!

21:16.400 --> 21:18.735
Tell me what the back
of Dolly Parton's

21:18.819 --> 21:20.320
house looks like!

21:22.406 --> 21:28.912
Merry Christmas!
And to all a kick-ass night!

21:28.996 --> 21:30.080
Peace!

21:30.163 --> 21:31.373
(cheering)

21:34.668 --> 21:37.129
-Secure line for Santa.
-Go for Santa.

21:37.212 --> 21:40.799
It's Candy, sir.
I just wanted to say before
you left, you were right.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.259
It is all about the kids.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.468
I'm glad you realized that.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.303
-Candy: One more thing.
-What's that?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.556
Remember I know everything...

21:47.639 --> 21:50.142
so I own you, fat man.
