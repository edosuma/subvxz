02:15.675 --> 02:17.302
Bag it.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.305
Let's go!

02:47.488 --> 02:49.450
Yeah?

02:51.329 --> 02:53.876
Professor,
we got the hard drive.

02:59.428 --> 03:01.015
Good girl.

03:37.463 --> 03:38.758
Yes, sir.

03:42.891 --> 03:44.392
Would you state your name

03:44.393 --> 03:45.604
and place of employment
for the record?

03:45.605 --> 03:47.482
Special Agent Ali Soufan,

03:47.483 --> 03:49.444
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

03:49.445 --> 03:51.114
Date and place of birth?

03:51.115 --> 03:53.118
July 8th, 1971.

03:53.119 --> 03:54.538
Sidon, Lebanon.

03:54.539 --> 03:55.958
Agent Soufan,

03:55.959 --> 03:58.045
you testified
in preliminary session

03:58.046 --> 04:00.049
that the CIA
withheld intelligence

04:00.050 --> 04:01.385
from the FBI

04:01.386 --> 04:03.347
on multiple occasions,

04:03.348 --> 04:04.850
intelligence that
would have prevented

04:04.851 --> 04:07.397
the attacks of September 11th.

04:07.398 --> 04:09.610
Yes, sir, I did.

04:09.611 --> 04:11.154
What you're saying is contrary

04:11.155 --> 04:12.866
to CIA testimony.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.411
All right.

04:14.412 --> 04:15.664
So you're telling us
they've lied

04:15.665 --> 04:18.293
to this commission?

04:18.295 --> 04:21.884
If members of the CIA
testified that the Agency

04:21.885 --> 04:24.682
properly shared information
with the Bureau

04:24.683 --> 04:29.900
in the manner in which
they are by law directed to,

04:29.901 --> 04:34.409
then you've been lied to.

04:34.410 --> 04:35.912
Can you tell us the first time

04:35.913 --> 04:37.750
you became aware the Agency

04:37.751 --> 04:41.674
was withholding information
from your FBI unit?

04:41.675 --> 04:43.595
In the summer of 1998.

04:43.596 --> 04:46.642
Martin Schmidt was the chief
of Alec Station,

04:46.643 --> 04:49.523
the Bin Laden unit of the CIA.

04:49.524 --> 04:52.613
Alec Station
was Schmidt's creation,

04:52.614 --> 04:55.201
his domain.

04:55.202 --> 04:57.330
He and his team
devoted their lives

04:57.331 --> 04:59.502
to the hunt for alQaeda.

04:59.503 --> 05:01.213
That hunt was meant to be done

05:01.214 --> 05:03.593
handinhand with the FBI.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.014
It wasn't.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.601
The Bureau had two agents

05:07.602 --> 05:09.312
assigned to Alec Station.

05:09.313 --> 05:12.068
They were supposed to be
informed of intelligence,

05:12.069 --> 05:14.532
so they could report it
back to my boss at the FBI,

05:14.533 --> 05:16.451
John O'Neill.

05:16.452 --> 05:17.788
That summer,

05:17.789 --> 05:19.750
Alec Station
came into possession

05:19.751 --> 05:21.838
of a hard drive
from an alQaeda cell

05:21.839 --> 05:23.508
in Eastern Europe.

05:23.509 --> 05:25.929
Martin Schmidt refused
to share that intelligence.

05:25.930 --> 05:28.350
Tirana.

05:28.351 --> 05:29.979
On that hard drive

05:29.980 --> 05:31.732
were lists of alQaeda operatives

05:31.733 --> 05:34.655
and more than 50
potential targets.

05:34.656 --> 05:36.491
You know, our boys
have been keeping an eye

05:36.492 --> 05:38.997
on the Albanian cell.

05:38.998 --> 05:40.501
Indeed I do.

05:43.423 --> 05:46.219
Professor, the retarded twins.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.809
Shut it down. Close up shop.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.202
What you going over
in there, Martin?

05:58.203 --> 06:00.206
Whatever we may
or may not be examining

06:00.207 --> 06:02.168
is entirely none
of your business.

06:02.169 --> 06:05.216
Sir, the way this works
is you show us what you've got

06:05.217 --> 06:08.347
and then we discuss
if it's our business.

06:08.348 --> 06:10.226
The ladies and I
analyze what we learn

06:10.227 --> 06:12.523
in the manner for which
we've been...

06:12.524 --> 06:14.735
shall we say, educated.

06:14.736 --> 06:17.156
Okay.

06:17.157 --> 06:18.701
We're flying back
to New York this morning.

06:18.702 --> 06:19.703
John O'Neill's gonna
want to know

06:19.704 --> 06:20.830
what you're looking at.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.626
I see.

06:22.627 --> 06:24.213
Fuck John O'Neill.

06:38.784 --> 06:40.369
Good morning, Mr. O'Neill.

06:40.370 --> 06:41.496
Margie.
They're all waiting for you.

06:41.497 --> 06:43.125
Good.

06:43.126 --> 06:45.004
Gordo, good morning.
Morning, boss.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.757
Kathy, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

06:46.758 --> 06:48.135
Glad to be of service. Bobby.

06:48.136 --> 06:49.597
Godfather. Suck me, asshole.

06:49.598 --> 06:50.890
Floyd, how are you?

06:50.891 --> 06:52.018
I'm good, sir. Good morning.

06:52.019 --> 06:53.437
So...

06:53.438 --> 06:54.773
I find out early this morning

06:54.774 --> 06:55.817
that the Agency raided

06:55.818 --> 06:57.613
Ahmed Salama Mabruk.

06:57.614 --> 06:59.825
Did they invite the Bureau
to ride along?

06:59.826 --> 07:02.163
Do they call on me
to pass on intel,

07:02.164 --> 07:03.750
or do I need to learn
about this shit

07:03.751 --> 07:04.960
all by myself?

07:04.961 --> 07:06.672
I'm done. We're gonna start

07:06.673 --> 07:09.302
acting on our own,
here and overseas.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.058
Let me ask you something.

07:12.059 --> 07:16.984
How many Arabic speakers
do we have in the Bureau?

07:16.985 --> 07:19.698
Anybody?

07:19.699 --> 07:22.078
Eight? Eight. Thank you.

07:22.079 --> 07:25.417
Eight Arabic speakers
out of more than 10,000 agents.

07:25.418 --> 07:26.754
That's how seriously

07:26.755 --> 07:27.964
our government
takes this threat.

07:27.965 --> 07:29.635
Sorry, boss. Shuttle was late.

07:29.636 --> 07:31.597
Kiss the ring. Suck me, Bobby.

07:31.598 --> 07:33.559
What's happening
in the Manson family?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.356
It is weird it's all women
and one bearded guy, right?

07:36.357 --> 07:39.070
Thought it was just me.

07:39.071 --> 07:40.406
Who is this?

07:40.407 --> 07:41.784
Your newest colleague,
Ali Soufan.

07:41.785 --> 07:43.955
He can answer
every question you have.

07:43.956 --> 07:45.792
All right.

07:45.793 --> 07:47.838
Welcome. How you doing, Ollie?

07:47.839 --> 07:49.717
Ali.

07:49.718 --> 07:50.885
That's what I said.

07:50.886 --> 07:52.304
It's all right.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.100
No, okay, shut Shut the fuck up.

07:54.101 --> 07:56.396
What happened
on the Mabruk raid?

07:56.397 --> 07:59.193
All we could learn was that
they renditioned him to Cairo

07:59.194 --> 08:00.947
and they got their hands
on a computer hard drive.

08:00.948 --> 08:01.991
You didn't see what's on it?

08:01.992 --> 08:03.452
Schmidt closed us out.

08:03.453 --> 08:05.540
God damn it.
Fuck that motherfucker.

08:05.541 --> 08:06.876
Interesting.

08:06.877 --> 08:07.878
He said the same thing
about you.

08:07.879 --> 08:09.631
Did you see anything?

08:09.632 --> 08:11.594
Him and the redhead were
putting some pins in a map.

08:11.595 --> 08:14.348
I think a few were in Africa.

08:14.349 --> 08:16.436
One went in Albania.

08:16.437 --> 08:17.773
Albania?

08:17.774 --> 08:21.070
Tirana, I think.

08:21.071 --> 08:22.991
Okay, fuck this.

08:22.992 --> 08:24.494
I'm getting Justice
to ram through

08:24.495 --> 08:25.747
an indictment on UBL

08:25.748 --> 08:27.124
so we can do this ourselves.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.418
We justwe gotta
give them something.

08:28.419 --> 08:30.882
Bobby, what do you got?

08:30.883 --> 08:33.721
Anythingold leads,
stale bullshit...

08:33.722 --> 08:37.102
I don't know, John. It...

08:37.102 --> 08:39.398
Remember Wadih elHage.

08:39.399 --> 08:41.904
Used to be UBL's secretary
in the Sudan,

08:41.905 --> 08:43.323
now lives in Nairobi?

08:43.323 --> 08:45.578
We know he broke with him
a while back.

08:45.579 --> 08:47.164
It may be a dead end, but...

08:47.165 --> 08:48.751
Get on the first plane to Kenya.

08:48.752 --> 08:50.713
I want whatever you can find.

08:50.714 --> 08:52.676
Something's up, people.
I can feel it.

08:52.677 --> 08:55.097
Bin Laden invited
US journalists to Afghanistan

08:55.098 --> 08:56.684
two weeks ago

08:56.685 --> 08:59.313
so he can get himself
on national TV

08:59.314 --> 09:00.943
tonight.

09:48.747 --> 09:50.793
Could you show me your gun?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.098
Mr. Bin Laden,

09:58.099 --> 09:59.810
John Miller, ABC News.

09:59.811 --> 10:01.437
You've been painted
as a terrorist

10:01.438 --> 10:03.108
by the American people.

10:03.109 --> 10:05.571
To your followers,
you're a hero.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.743
How do you see yourself?

10:31.791 --> 10:32.876
Mr. Bin Laden,

10:32.877 --> 10:34.211
you issued a fatwa

10:34.212 --> 10:35.965
calling on Muslims
to kill Americans

10:35.966 --> 10:38.053
where they can, when they can.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.141
Is that directed
at all Americans?

11:17.925 --> 11:20.470
Bin Laden left his home
in Saudi Arabia

11:20.471 --> 11:21.598
at the age of 19

11:21.599 --> 11:23.017
to join the Muslims fighting

11:23.018 --> 11:25.648
the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.

11:25.649 --> 11:27.025
Like many of the young fighters,

11:27.026 --> 11:29.113
he was religious and committed.

11:29.114 --> 11:30.407
Unlike any other,

11:30.408 --> 11:31.743
he came from a Saudi family

11:31.744 --> 11:32.996
that ran a construction empire

11:32.997 --> 11:35.250
worth $5 billion.

11:35.251 --> 11:36.879
Bin Laden's personal worth

11:36.880 --> 11:39.341
is estimated at $200 million.

11:39.342 --> 11:41.722
Bin Laden has made
these threats before,

11:41.723 --> 11:44.018
but this time,
there's something different.

11:44.019 --> 11:45.605
He put a time cap on it,

11:45.606 --> 11:47.357
saying that whatever action
will be taken

11:47.358 --> 11:49.236
against Americans in the Gulf

11:49.237 --> 11:50.907
whatever violence awaits,

11:50.908 --> 11:53.453
will occur within
the next few weeks.

11:53.454 --> 11:55.751
Ted.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.016
Soufan.

12:04.017 --> 12:06.104
Get your coat.
We're going to dinner.

12:09.069 --> 12:10.530
Think he's a maniac.

12:10.531 --> 12:13.745
- I, yeah.
- He's a maniac.

12:18.964 --> 12:20.591
Look what the cat dragged in.

12:20.592 --> 12:21.843
Hello, beautiful.

12:21.844 --> 12:23.388
Feels like forever.

12:23.389 --> 12:25.141
24 hours will do that.

12:25.142 --> 12:27.772
When you miss someone,
you miss someone.

12:27.773 --> 12:30.654
Dougie! Bring Johnny his drink.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.921
You applied to the Bureau
on a dare?

12:39.922 --> 12:41.340
I was in grad school.

12:41.341 --> 12:43.177
My friends thought
it would be funny

12:43.178 --> 12:44.471
if a Muslim who drank heavily

12:44.472 --> 12:46.225
sent in a rÃ©sumÃ©.

12:46.226 --> 12:47.812
We weren't sure which one

12:47.813 --> 12:49.315
would disqualify me more:

12:49.316 --> 12:51.653
The alcohol or the Islam.

12:51.654 --> 12:54.199
We even had a pool
whether I'd get in or not.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.410
You put money in the pot?

12:55.411 --> 12:57.289
I lost.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.544
Here's to losing.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.673
You practice?

13:01.674 --> 13:03.927
Islam?

13:03.928 --> 13:07.309
Not in a long time.

13:07.310 --> 13:08.812
You?

13:08.813 --> 13:12.027
Church and me
broke up a lifetime ago.

13:12.028 --> 13:15.576
Talk to me about the interview.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.997
I think it's the third warning.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.878
First was the '96
declaration of jihad.

13:20.879 --> 13:23.216
Then the February fatwa.

13:23.217 --> 13:24.678
And now, Bin Laden is going

13:24.679 --> 13:26.138
straight to the American people.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.725
Why three times?

13:27.726 --> 13:30.731
There's this unauthenticated
hadith

13:30.732 --> 13:33.027
the sayings of the
Prophet Muhammed.

13:33.028 --> 13:35.741
Some think he said it;
Some don't.

13:35.742 --> 13:37.787
"When you see
a snake in your house,

13:37.788 --> 13:39.582
"you should warn it three times.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.087
"If it returns,
you must kill it.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.632
It is a devil."

13:43.633 --> 13:46.303
UBL's warning the snake
to get out of his house.

13:46.304 --> 13:48.266
Telling America
to get out of the Middle East,

13:48.267 --> 13:50.855
out of Saudi Arabia
in particular.

13:50.856 --> 13:53.192
That's why he wanted
to get on TV.

13:53.193 --> 13:56.658
He used Miller's interview
toto appear strong

13:56.659 --> 13:58.244
by threatening the United States

13:58.245 --> 13:59.748
as he looked an American
directly in the.

13:59.749 --> 14:02.377
Hey! Glad you could make it.

14:02.378 --> 14:04.256
John Miller,
meet Agent Ali Soufan.

14:04.257 --> 14:05.801
He was just talking about you.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.137
You think I got used?

14:09.977 --> 14:11.563
Mr. Miller, I assure you, I...

14:11.564 --> 14:14.193
Sit down, sit down, both of you.

14:14.194 --> 14:16.322
Come on,
can't we all just get along?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.451
Did he just quote Rodney King?

14:18.452 --> 14:20.455
Audrey,
Glenlivet and rocks for Miller.

14:20.456 --> 14:23.169
So, world traveler, how was it?

14:23.170 --> 14:24.463
Total luxury.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.050
Taliban mountain resort.

14:26.051 --> 14:28.639
Those guys know
how to throw a party.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.141
Well, you deserve the best.

14:30.142 --> 14:31.937
Hey, that was a good piece
you put together.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.943
The network kept making me
cut it down.

14:34.944 --> 14:37.990
All anyone wants to hear about
is Monica's cumstained dress.

14:37.991 --> 14:40.495
See, I don't get that.
I've cum on a lot of dresses

14:40.496 --> 14:42.165
and nobody ever wants
to hear about those.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.127
Show me the dress
and I'll do the reporting.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.049
Salut. Salut.

14:48.303 --> 14:49.806
Let me ask you something.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.392
The background footage
for your interview

14:51.393 --> 14:53.354
had two guys scrubbed out.

14:53.355 --> 14:55.024
Why is that?

14:55.025 --> 14:57.905
Ayman alZawahiri.
You know who he is.

14:57.906 --> 15:00.536
He insisted that we erase
a couple of guys from the shots

15:00.537 --> 15:01.872
before he'd hand over the tapes.

15:01.873 --> 15:04.669
Why those guys?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.172
No idea.

15:09.178 --> 15:10.807
Maybe you did get used.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.156
White here.

15:19.157 --> 15:20.534
Mary Jo,
you're the only other person

15:20.535 --> 15:21.786
in the Justice Department

15:21.787 --> 15:23.540
who actually works for a living.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.084
Do you call what you do working?

15:25.085 --> 15:27.172
I'm sitting at my desk.
How about you?

15:27.173 --> 15:28.675
It's all work,

15:28.676 --> 15:30.386
whether you're getting drunk
doing it or not.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.934
Well, I went into
the wrong end of the business.

15:32.935 --> 15:34.186
What's up, John?

15:34.187 --> 15:35.522
You see the interview tonight?

15:35.523 --> 15:36.983
I called Louis Freeh afterwards.

15:36.984 --> 15:38.444
He's tucked in bed
with his cell phone off.

15:38.445 --> 15:39.781
What the fuck is that?

15:39.782 --> 15:41.618
I suppose he's trying to sleep.

15:41.619 --> 15:43.329
Tell me what I can do for you.

15:43.330 --> 15:44.874
We just got warned by alQaeda

15:44.875 --> 15:46.085
on national TV,

15:46.086 --> 15:48.882
and our director
slept through it.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.051
We're running out of time.

15:50.052 --> 15:51.261
We tried to get Alec Station

15:51.262 --> 15:52.765
to hand over intel.

15:52.766 --> 15:55.353
We ask, we ask,
they don't give a shit.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.273
I49 needs an indictment

15:57.274 --> 15:58.860
so we can start
acting on our own.

15:58.861 --> 16:02.576
Tie UBL to something concrete.

16:02.577 --> 16:05.833
Karachi consulate van attack,
Khobar Towers.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.254
You get me anything decent,
even if it's old,

16:08.255 --> 16:09.758
I'll get you an indictment.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.347
You're a good woman, Mary Jo.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.059
Go home and get some sleep.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.311
You too.

16:16.312 --> 16:17.524
I'm working on it.

16:24.162 --> 16:26.624
You're playing our song.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.503
Is this our song?

16:28.504 --> 16:31.216
You making love to Puccini
with somebody else these days?

16:31.217 --> 16:33.680
A few guys, mostly freshmen.

16:33.681 --> 16:37.813
At least they're learning
something useful.

16:37.814 --> 16:40.109
They're certainly
not learning anything else.

16:40.110 --> 16:42.238
If I have to read
another "Beowulf" essay

16:42.239 --> 16:44.242
cribbed from freaking
Cliffs Notes,

16:44.243 --> 16:45.495
I'm gonna kill someone.

16:45.496 --> 16:46.915
Well, don't do that,

16:46.916 --> 16:49.127
'cause then I'd have to
arrest you.

16:50.715 --> 16:54.054
Is that a promise?

16:54.055 --> 16:56.308
Well, aren't you sweet?

16:58.815 --> 17:01.401
"Whan that Aprill

17:01.402 --> 17:04.324
"with his shoures soote,

17:04.325 --> 17:06.161
"the droghte of March

17:06.162 --> 17:09.126
hath perced to the roote..."

17:09.127 --> 17:11.923
That's good.

17:11.924 --> 17:14.136
The Jesuits taught you well.

17:14.137 --> 17:16.390
"And bathed every veyne
in swich licour

17:16.391 --> 17:20.147
of which vertu engendred
is the flour..."

17:20.148 --> 17:22.694
That is so good.

17:22.695 --> 17:25.242
It's Chaucer, but it's good.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.166
Is that a gun in your pocket,

17:29.167 --> 17:31.713
or are you just happy to see me?

17:31.714 --> 17:35.053
You know I keep my firearm
on my ankle.

17:44.990 --> 17:46.450
How was your day, baby?

17:46.451 --> 17:48.789
Just trying
to catch some bad guys.

17:50.543 --> 17:52.714
If I could only figure out
where they are.

18:49.368 --> 18:52.415
He's got a charity called
Help Africa People,

18:52.416 --> 18:54.879
whatever that means.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.634
We think he's got
this American wife,

18:57.635 --> 18:59.806
April Brightsky Ray.

19:06.402 --> 19:09.450
If she's here,
I can do the talking.

19:10.703 --> 19:12.372
Sir.

19:12.373 --> 19:14.084
You will do the talking
either way.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.880
This is as far as we go.

19:37.799 --> 19:39.342
Who invited you here?

19:39.343 --> 19:42.015
Robert Chesney,
United States FBI.

19:43.644 --> 19:45.354
I have a warrant
to inspect the home

19:45.355 --> 19:46.899
of Wadih alHage

19:46.900 --> 19:48.904
and April Brightsky Ray.

19:50.825 --> 19:52.870
What if I say no?

19:52.871 --> 19:55.082
I'm afraid I'd have to
go inside anyway.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.629
What if I decide
to untie this dog?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.508
I'm more of a cat person myself,

19:59.509 --> 20:02.598
so I'm concerned,

20:02.599 --> 20:03.808
and if I get frightened,

20:03.809 --> 20:05.228
I might have to shoot him.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.062
And I wouldn't want to do that
in front of your kids.

20:10.155 --> 20:11.364
Come on.

20:11.365 --> 20:12.785
Thank you.

20:14.873 --> 20:17.001
You got to come
all the way to Africa

20:17.002 --> 20:18.505
just to get up in our business.

20:18.506 --> 20:21.051
Look. We good people.

20:21.052 --> 20:22.386
I got kids to take care of,

20:22.387 --> 20:23.806
my daily housework to do,

20:23.807 --> 20:25.392
dinner to prepare,

20:25.393 --> 20:27.814
and we just trying
to do some good work.

20:27.815 --> 20:29.108
Charity work.

20:29.109 --> 20:30.904
Help some people.

20:30.905 --> 20:33.492
That's the charity
you, run with your husband,

20:33.493 --> 20:35.287
Help Africa People?

20:35.288 --> 20:37.208
Don't you get on at me
about that name.

20:37.209 --> 20:40.172
I told the old man
it didn't make no sense.

20:40.173 --> 20:43.095
I think it's
a perfectly good name.

20:43.096 --> 20:45.224
Of course,

20:45.225 --> 20:46.978
if you decide

20:46.979 --> 20:49.274
to change the grammar, I...

20:49.275 --> 20:53.448
I suggest you have
a few decent choices.

20:53.449 --> 20:55.286
You could add a comma.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.123
That would make it
an exhortation,

20:57.124 --> 20:58.835
an encouragement.

20:58.836 --> 21:01.591
"Help Africa, people."

21:01.592 --> 21:04.095
Or you could simply add an N.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.849
Help African People.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.811
That's probably what
you're going for anyway, right?

21:07.812 --> 21:09.607
Hello.

21:09.608 --> 21:11.067
What are you doing in my house?

21:11.068 --> 21:13.405
Alone with my wife in my house?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.493
Robert Chesney,

21:18.124 --> 21:21.130
I have a warrant
to inspect your home.

21:25.514 --> 21:27.768
Why must you come
to harass my family?

21:27.769 --> 21:29.855
I am charity worker.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.193
We were just talking about that.

21:32.194 --> 21:34.405
You were the personal secretary

21:34.406 --> 21:36.076
to Usama bin Laden.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.244
Is that correct?

21:37.245 --> 21:39.415
Many years ago. No longer.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.336
Do you ever speak with him now?

21:41.337 --> 21:42.839
Never.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.175
Email?

21:44.176 --> 21:46.262
Afghanistan does not have AOL.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.686
I see.

21:49.938 --> 21:52.191
But...

21:52.192 --> 21:53.402
you did work for him.

21:53.403 --> 21:55.072
Many years ago.

21:55.073 --> 21:56.785
So manya very long time.

21:59.164 --> 22:01.460
Did you do work for him
on this computer?

22:59.619 --> 23:01.329
We have a major story
in the news this morning.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.498
NBC News has learned

23:02.499 --> 23:05.087
that Monica Lewinsky is ready

23:05.088 --> 23:06.507
to tell the grand jury that she

23:06.508 --> 23:08.260
and President Clinton
discussed ways

23:08.261 --> 23:09.763
of hiding their relationship.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.559
NBC News has confirmed a story

23:11.560 --> 23:13.688
first reported by
"The New York Times"

23:13.689 --> 23:15.107
that the two agreed to deny

23:15.108 --> 23:17.236
that they had
a sexual relationship.

23:17.237 --> 23:18.990
Lewinsky was granted
full immunity Tuesday

23:18.991 --> 23:20.577
by Ken Starr in exchange

23:20.578 --> 23:23.207
for her full
and truthful testimony.

23:24.627 --> 23:26.714
Thank you for making
yourselves available

23:26.715 --> 23:28.593
once again. Thanks especially

23:28.594 --> 23:32.308
to those who travel in. John.

23:32.309 --> 23:34.563
I come from all the way
across the river.

23:34.564 --> 23:36.734
You do, and the American people

23:36.735 --> 23:38.988
owe you a debt of gratitude.

23:38.989 --> 23:40.449
Let's get status updates

23:40.450 --> 23:42.746
before moving ahead. General?

23:42.747 --> 23:44.498
Details of continuing ops

23:44.499 --> 23:45.627
are there for you to read.

23:45.628 --> 23:47.212
The headline is our readiness

23:47.213 --> 23:48.340
in Senegal

23:48.341 --> 23:49.760
to evacuate from GuineaBissau

23:49.761 --> 23:52.348
if the military coup
spills over.

23:52.349 --> 23:55.270
Good. Thank you, General.

23:55.271 --> 23:58.360
Martin? Nothing new this week.

23:58.361 --> 24:00.990
You have nothing new?

24:00.991 --> 24:02.326
That's what I said, John.

24:03.705 --> 24:05.541
You think I'm a complete moron?

24:05.542 --> 24:07.044
You interested
in an answer to that question?

24:07.045 --> 24:09.215
Can I remind you of
NS Directive 30,

24:09.216 --> 24:12.012
signed by President Reagan,
and PRD44,

24:12.013 --> 24:14.518
signed by President Clinton?
Thank you for the memories.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.270
It's not your choice
whether you share intelligence.

24:16.271 --> 24:17.857
You're required to share it
with the FBI

24:17.858 --> 24:19.402
and everybody else in this room.

24:19.403 --> 24:21.447
I have nothing new, Richard.

24:21.448 --> 24:24.579
What's going on in Albania,
Marty?

24:24.580 --> 24:26.542
You got a hard drive
from Ahmad Salama Mabruk

24:26.543 --> 24:29.171
that mentions Albania.
Where's Mabruk?

24:29.172 --> 24:31.467
Why hasn't the FBI had
a chance to question him?

24:31.468 --> 24:34.056
What's on his hard drive?

24:34.057 --> 24:35.475
You got a stash of intel

24:35.476 --> 24:37.689
that you refuse to share
with my agents.

24:37.690 --> 24:39.860
If we were in possession
of such a computer,

24:39.861 --> 24:41.697
and I'm not confirming
that we are,

24:41.698 --> 24:43.366
it would be
a foreign intelligence matter,

24:43.367 --> 24:46.164
not a law enforcement matter.

24:46.165 --> 24:47.917
So you do have the hard drive.

24:47.918 --> 24:49.128
I don't know how
you reached that.

24:49.129 --> 24:50.130
How would you know if it was

24:50.131 --> 24:51.382
a law enforcement matter

24:51.383 --> 24:52.844
or a foreign intelligence matter

24:52.845 --> 24:56.142
if you haven't looked
at the hard drive?

24:56.143 --> 24:59.065
If we did have
any intelligence whatsoever,

24:59.066 --> 25:01.528
it would be for us to decide
how best to use it

25:01.529 --> 25:03.239
before you do
what you always do:

25:03.240 --> 25:04.785
Go around the globe
arresting people

25:04.786 --> 25:06.914
and putting them on trial,
before you blow

25:06.915 --> 25:08.751
a possible gold mine
of information

25:08.752 --> 25:11.255
and render it utterly useless.

25:11.256 --> 25:13.176
So no, I'm not prepared to say
one way or the other.

25:13.177 --> 25:15.472
How about
you take a deep fucking breath

25:15.473 --> 25:16.725
and get yourself prepared.

25:16.726 --> 25:17.811
Okay, calm down for a minute.

25:17.812 --> 25:19.188
I don't want to calm down.

25:19.189 --> 25:22.654
Either of you watch TV
the other night?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.115
If one American gets killed

25:24.116 --> 25:25.660
because of information
you kept secret,

25:25.661 --> 25:27.454
when I get my hands
on that hard drive

25:27.455 --> 25:29.041
and I will get my hands on it

25:29.042 --> 25:31.379
I will shove that thing
so far up your ass

25:31.380 --> 25:33.258
you'll be combing shit out of
your pompous fucking beard.

25:33.259 --> 25:35.053
All right, all right.
Enough, John.

25:35.054 --> 25:36.557
Martin, after the meeting,

25:36.558 --> 25:38.351
you will return to Alec

25:38.352 --> 25:40.313
and go through what you've got
with your team.

25:40.314 --> 25:42.067
The point of these meetings
is to share

25:42.068 --> 25:43.737
what we've got from our teams
and work together.

25:43.738 --> 25:45.658
We might need to
watchlist names.

25:45.659 --> 25:47.411
We might.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.456
You know what, gentlemen?
Have a good meeting.

25:49.457 --> 25:51.546
I need to do some actual work.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.811
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

25:59.812 --> 26:01.982
Well, that is a shame,

26:01.983 --> 26:03.903
'cause I'm making your favorite.

26:03.904 --> 26:06.700
Not the lasagna
with the ground veal.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.913
You're missing out.

26:08.914 --> 26:10.541
I had a terrible day here.

26:10.542 --> 26:13.129
I gotta stick around,
make things right.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.175
Any chance that you catch
the last shuttle?

26:15.176 --> 26:16.344
You can wake me up.

26:18.057 --> 26:19.266
I can't.

26:19.267 --> 26:20.895
It's my loss.

26:20.896 --> 26:22.147
You bet it is,

26:22.148 --> 26:23.399
and I'm not just talking food.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.655
You're killing me.

26:25.656 --> 26:28.034
I gotta go, baby.

26:28.035 --> 26:29.996
All right.

26:29.997 --> 26:32.292
Well, go catch some bad guys.

26:32.293 --> 26:33.587
Love you.

26:33.588 --> 26:35.007
You too.

26:57.553 --> 26:58.762
Johnny!

26:58.763 --> 27:00.224
You scared me!

27:03.355 --> 27:05.192
You're a sweetheart.

27:07.906 --> 27:09.827
You're playing our song.

27:26.986 --> 27:28.907
Bottled water?

27:52.370 --> 27:53.371
Robert Chesney?

27:53.372 --> 27:54.541
Hi.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.626
Bob.

27:55.627 --> 27:57.337
You can call me Bob.

27:57.338 --> 27:59.049
Deb Fletcher, Chief of...

27:59.050 --> 28:00.135
Station.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.387
Um...

28:01.388 --> 28:03.600
Yeah. Hi.

28:03.601 --> 28:05.437
What you got there? Is that from

28:05.438 --> 28:06.606
an archaeological dig
or something?

28:06.607 --> 28:08.317
Yeah, I know.

28:08.318 --> 28:09.863
It's an ancient one.

28:09.864 --> 28:11.157
Big.

28:11.158 --> 28:12.284
Hope we can still turn it on.

28:12.285 --> 28:13.537
Can I help you carry it?

28:13.538 --> 28:14.539
No, no.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.666
No, I can handle it.

28:15.667 --> 28:17.169
I...

28:17.170 --> 28:19.006
I can do this.

28:19.007 --> 28:21.595
All right, macho man. This way.

28:21.596 --> 28:22.930
I didn't notice you come over.

28:22.931 --> 28:26.145
I was watching...
well, all of this.

28:26.146 --> 28:28.483
Yeah, it can get
a little nuts in here.

28:28.484 --> 28:30.361
It's lively. It's nice.

28:30.362 --> 28:31.781
It is nice.

28:31.782 --> 28:33.702
People come and go all day long.

28:33.703 --> 28:37.960
Lots of folks bring their kids,
as you can see.

28:37.961 --> 28:39.964
I'm not so crazy
about how exposed we are.

28:39.965 --> 28:41.551
To the street.

28:41.552 --> 28:43.972
Yeah, the ambassador
complained about it,

28:43.973 --> 28:46.352
but there's a part of me
that also likes it.

28:46.353 --> 28:47.522
All the light.

28:47.523 --> 28:48.607
Yeah.

28:48.608 --> 28:50.318
Not being so cut off.

28:50.319 --> 28:52.030
I mean, why go someplace

28:52.031 --> 28:54.243
if you can't get involved
with the folks there, right?

28:54.244 --> 28:55.913
Get to know the people.

28:55.914 --> 28:57.457
You know what I mean?

28:57.458 --> 29:00.129
Super important
to get involved with people.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.510
I'm glad you think so,
Bob Chesney.

29:02.511 --> 29:04.304
You'll work in here.

29:04.305 --> 29:07.394
There's a secure phone line

29:07.395 --> 29:09.356
for when you need to call HQ.

29:09.357 --> 29:11.695
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.615
Come find me when you're done.

29:13.616 --> 29:15.954
I'm one floor up.

30:46.510 --> 30:49.139
O'Neill. John.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.642
I've been up all night,
going through

30:50.643 --> 30:52.938
elHage's computer.

30:52.939 --> 30:54.942
You know, my Arabic
is pretty much for shit,

30:54.943 --> 30:57.656
but there seems to be
some training material

30:57.657 --> 30:59.451
that got sent to Somalia

30:59.452 --> 31:00.871
in '92, '93,

31:00.872 --> 31:02.792
before Black Hawk Down.

31:02.793 --> 31:04.419
Maybe some funding, too.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.758
That's perfect.
That'll get us our indictment.

31:06.759 --> 31:09.514
You can get the new guy,
Soufan, to go through it all.

31:09.515 --> 31:11.601
Mary Jo'll make it work
whatever's there.

31:11.602 --> 31:14.816
There's something else.

31:14.817 --> 31:17.278
There's a lot of photos on here.

31:17.279 --> 31:19.575
Probably for forging passports
or whatnot,

31:19.576 --> 31:21.538
but one of them,

31:21.539 --> 31:23.875
I'll bet my life,

31:23.876 --> 31:28.050
is Zawahiri's brother,
Muhammed alZawahiri.

31:28.051 --> 31:30.054
Bobby,
I could fuck you right now.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.641
You know he runs
the Albania cell.

31:31.642 --> 31:33.895
Out of Tirana.
You're a beautiful man.

31:33.896 --> 31:35.147
Pouch it to me here,
share the intel

31:35.148 --> 31:37.402
with the Sisters,
and come on home.

31:37.403 --> 31:38.864
Youyou've done good, Bobby.

31:38.865 --> 31:40.241
Suck me.

31:40.242 --> 31:41.911
Whatever you want.
I'm here for you.

31:41.912 --> 31:43.206
Fuck you. Fuck you too.

31:55.272 --> 31:56.315
John.

31:56.316 --> 31:57.400
You gotta level with me.

31:57.401 --> 31:58.402
Is the Agency making a move

31:58.403 --> 31:59.739
in Tirana?

31:59.740 --> 32:01.325
I got a computer that belongs to.

32:01.326 --> 32:02.703
UBL's Sudan secretary

32:02.704 --> 32:04.080
that's got passport photos

32:04.081 --> 32:06.544
of Muhammed alZawahiri.

32:06.545 --> 32:08.255
If there's something going down
in Tirana,

32:08.256 --> 32:10.344
I got a right
to have an agent there.

32:13.726 --> 32:15.311
Thanks for meeting me
out so late.

32:15.312 --> 32:16.522
Sure.

32:16.523 --> 32:18.233
So how are the kids?

32:18.234 --> 32:19.987
It's special ed students
you teach, yeah?

32:21.282 --> 32:22.619
Wait, how did you know that?

32:24.288 --> 32:25.540
I do a background check

32:25.541 --> 32:27.962
on anyone I go on a date with.

32:27.963 --> 32:29.381
Ali.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.302
You finally visit me again. Hey.

32:34.141 --> 32:35.393
He used to

32:35.394 --> 32:36.395
practically live here.

32:36.396 --> 32:37.690
Now I cry every day

32:37.691 --> 32:39.150
because he don't come here
no more.

32:39.151 --> 32:40.570
Sorry.?

32:40.571 --> 32:42.031
I've been so busy at work.

32:42.032 --> 32:44.119
No excuses.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.454
Welcome to Moustache,
young lady.

32:45.455 --> 32:46.874
My name is Omar.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.670
Hello, Omar.
It's nice to meet you.

32:48.671 --> 32:50.172
I'm Heather.

32:50.173 --> 32:51.425
Anything else you want to know,
though,

32:51.426 --> 32:52.553
just ask him.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.139
He's got the whole dossier.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.936
He turn on the charms
already, has he?

32:58.314 --> 33:00.109
I bring the wine, on the house.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.486
White?

33:01.487 --> 33:03.240
That would be lovely. Thank you.

33:03.241 --> 33:04.326
Thanks, Omar.

33:07.751 --> 33:09.169
He's nice.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.672
He's been like
a second father to me

33:10.673 --> 33:13.052
since I moved to New York.

33:13.053 --> 33:15.849
Look, I didn't mean
to freak you out.

33:15.850 --> 33:17.770
I was trying to make a joke.

33:17.771 --> 33:20.275
Bad joke.-

33:25.285 --> 33:26.996
Are you gonna...

33:26.997 --> 33:30.044
Go ahead. Sorry.

33:30.045 --> 33:31.506
Hi, boss.

33:31.507 --> 33:33.343
You're going to Albania.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.808
- When?
- Now.

33:36.809 --> 33:38.268
The next flight to Frankfurt

33:38.269 --> 33:39.688
leaves in 90 minutes.

33:39.689 --> 33:41.943
You can transfer
from there to Tirana.

33:41.944 --> 33:45.324
The Sisters are raiding
Muhammed alZawahiri's cell.

33:45.325 --> 33:48.623
They'll give you a weapon
when they pick you up.

33:48.624 --> 33:51.671
Now listen to me.
This is the real deal.

33:51.672 --> 33:53.465
Make sure you lay eyes on

33:53.466 --> 33:55.595
any evidence they seize.

33:55.596 --> 33:57.933
If it's in Arabic,
I need you reading it.

33:57.934 --> 34:01.607
I want you talking to
whoever they pick up, okay?

34:01.608 --> 34:03.778
But most important,

34:03.779 --> 34:05.532
be careful.

34:05.533 --> 34:06.951
When you land,

34:06.952 --> 34:09.246
do not go into
the terminal building.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.042
Stay on the tarmac,

34:11.043 --> 34:13.088
as long as it takes.

34:13.089 --> 34:14.842
You'll be picked up.

34:14.842 --> 34:15.844
You hear me?

34:15.844 --> 34:17.138
Yes, sir.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.184
Stay on the tarmac.

34:19.185 --> 34:20.978
Wait till they come for you.

34:20.980 --> 34:23.025
- Okay.
- Good luck.

34:32.503 --> 34:35.592
Don't tell me you have to leave?

34:40.185 --> 34:42.103
Okay, then.

34:42.105 --> 34:44.067
I'm sorry, I I really have to.

34:47.951 --> 34:50.705
I apologize.
I have to leave, Omar.

34:50.706 --> 34:52.960
Heather, please stay?

34:52.960 --> 34:54.588
We'll have some wine.

34:54.589 --> 34:57.636
I'll get you taxi.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.015
Please stay
and have a drink with me.

35:01.728 --> 35:03.313
Okay.

35:03.314 --> 35:07.029
Good.

35:07.030 --> 35:08.950
Be safe.

35:08.951 --> 35:10.369
Come home soon, inshallah.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.750
Inshallah.

35:14.504 --> 35:15.840
I'm sorry.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.823
Ali Soufan...

35:28.824 --> 35:31.746
is a good man.

35:31.747 --> 35:33.958
He come here alone
four times each week

35:33.959 --> 35:37.089
the first year
he lived in New York.

35:37.090 --> 35:38.593
I believe he was looking
for someplace

35:38.594 --> 35:42.183
to feel more at home.

35:42.184 --> 35:44.646
Please.

35:44.647 --> 35:46.943
Consider giving him
another chance.

35:49.657 --> 35:51.493
Fee sahtikum.

35:51.494 --> 35:53.582
To your health.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.921
I don't understand.

36:38.922 --> 36:41.802
You must go into
terminal building.

36:41.803 --> 36:43.472
Thank you, but I'll wait here.

36:43.473 --> 36:44.808
Now.

36:44.809 --> 36:46.269
Go into terminal building.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.939
I'm being picked up,

36:47.940 --> 36:51.321
so I'll wait here.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.645
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:18.544 --> 37:19.962
Get in! Who are you?

37:19.963 --> 37:21.339
If you're Soufan,
we're your ride.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.302
Get your ass in the car!

37:26.893 --> 37:28.814
Welcome to Albania.

37:43.677 --> 37:45.262
Professor, the boys in the field

37:45.263 --> 37:46.557
are en route.

37:46.558 --> 37:48.894
Rendition plan remains the same?

37:48.895 --> 37:50.898
They're EIJ.

37:50.899 --> 37:52.527
Egypt wants them,
Egypt gets them.

37:52.528 --> 37:53.946
Yes, sir. Send them to Cairo

37:53.947 --> 37:55.282
in the morning. Get your answers

37:55.283 --> 37:58.413
by the afternoon.

37:58.414 --> 38:01.377
I like the way you think, Diane.

38:01.378 --> 38:02.923
We're of one mind, Professor.

40:57.105 --> 40:58.941
Back away.

40:58.942 --> 41:00.695
Back away from the machine.

41:00.696 --> 41:03.617
Ibiidi aan ilghassala!
Itharraki.

41:03.618 --> 41:04.744
Soufan?

41:04.745 --> 41:05.914
You in there? Yeah!

41:28.585 --> 41:30.170
Where are you taking them?

41:30.171 --> 41:32.300
Away.

41:35.222 --> 41:36.516
Hey.

41:36.517 --> 41:38.187
Where are you taking them?

41:39.439 --> 41:41.861
Orders from Langley.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.097
- O'Neill.
- Boss.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.307
We raided the house,

41:57.308 --> 41:58.936
arrested four individuals

41:58.937 --> 42:00.438
none of them Zawahiri,

42:00.439 --> 42:02.234
confiscated explosives

42:02.235 --> 42:03.946
and batteries and wiring.

42:03.947 --> 42:06.408
The Sisters took the suspects
to Egypt.

42:06.409 --> 42:08.539
I looked through the house

42:08.540 --> 42:10.208
and there was
no written material,

42:10.209 --> 42:12.505
no computers,

42:12.506 --> 42:15.469
so I got no information
to pass to you.

42:17.348 --> 42:19.184
I'm sorry, boss. I let you down.

42:19.185 --> 42:20.688
You didn't let me down.

42:20.689 --> 42:22.190
This is one of
Ayman alZawahiri's

42:22.191 --> 42:23.735
biggest cells. They were clearly

42:23.736 --> 42:25.071
planning to hit something,

42:25.072 --> 42:26.783
probably the embassy.

42:26.784 --> 42:28.996
Maybe Albania was
the most urgent warning

42:28.997 --> 42:32.335
the Agency found
on Mabruk's hard drive.

42:32.336 --> 42:34.131
Let's hope so.

42:34.132 --> 42:36.845
Let's hope they're not planning
to hit somewhere else.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.724
You did good.

42:38.725 --> 42:40.310
Okay, thank you, sir.

42:40.311 --> 42:42.397
Thank you, son.

42:42.398 --> 42:43.693
Come on home.

43:32.164 --> 43:34.877
To America, I can say

43:34.878 --> 43:38.342
that your message
has been received,

43:38.343 --> 43:39.595
and the response,

43:39.596 --> 43:41.558
with the help of Allah,

43:41.559 --> 43:43.603
will be written in a language

43:43.604 --> 43:46.108
you will understand

43:46.109 --> 43:47.820
and will be delivered

43:47.821 --> 43:50.242
directly to your home.

44:23.475 --> 44:25.730
Welcome home.

44:32.410 --> 44:36.250
There you go.

44:36.251 --> 44:37.628
Come on.

44:37.629 --> 44:39.006
Him too.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.933
It's late.

44:46.564 --> 44:48.734
You staying the night?

44:49.987 --> 44:51.907
No.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.301
Hey, open the gate!

46:04.302 --> 46:05.721
Open the gate now!

46:05.722 --> 46:08.893
For what? I said open the gate!

46:43.631 --> 46:46.343
John, Dick Clarke.

Hello.

46:58.703 --> 47:01.249
Ali, turn on your television.

47:03.504 --> 47:05.507
Causing parallel scenes of chaos

47:05.508 --> 47:07.135
at US embassies in neighboring.

47:07.136 --> 47:09.640
East African capitals.

an apparent bomb blast

47:11.310 --> 47:12.813

450 miles away

47:16.237 --> 47:17.823

47:17.824 --> 47:19.577
I'm gonna need you
in the office.

47:19.578 --> 47:21.496
I'm on my way in.

47:21.497 --> 47:23.209
