00:01.000 --> 00:02.520
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

00:02.544 --> 00:04.705
When the moment comes,
do it.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.163
Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

00:07.257 --> 00:10.967
<i>Repair of small objects.</i>

00:11.053 --> 00:13.420
<i>You did always excel
at minor mending.</i>

00:13.597 --> 00:16.340
- I want you in my life.
- I want that too.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.675
<i>The Binder knew Julia
had many questions.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:19.850
And he knew the answer.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.769
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

00:21.855 --> 00:24.472
You're hoarding magic,
trying to become a god?

00:24.566 --> 00:27.650
By becoming one of them,
I can rip their secrets away from them.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.316
<i>I redirected the power
I need into a reservoir.</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:32.692
<i>You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:35.053
This should fix the whole fish deal.
I'll bring Eliot back.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.319
<i>My sister...
I need to find her a body.</i>

00:37.412 --> 00:38.556
<i>So The Monster took Julia.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:39.641
<i>We need to find them.</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:42.352
We have the axes and the demon bottles.
You have the incorporate bond.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.993
Casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

00:45.128 --> 00:46.960
<i>would take
an insane amount of power.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:49.255
The question is,
who put us here?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.460
Our parents.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.544
They're more vulnerable than you think.
If we can get to their realm.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.299
<i>We had a key.
A scroll.</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:58.257
Julia, if you're in there,
I'm sorry.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.718
Hey, Monster

01:02.479 --> 01:03.765
Lady.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.739 --> 01:16.073
Adorable.
So determined.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.866
Maybe I'll keep you as pets.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.748
Then again, I like my pets strong,
and you're weak.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.503
You're already fading,
aren't you?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.648
It worked.
Q, the bond.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.419
I don't know how long
that's going to hold.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.551
We need to
get to Brakebills.

01:56.575 --> 01:57.719
I have something
that can help.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.700
- We need to get her help.
- Wait, where's Eliot?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.889
We can't. We don't have enough.
We have to go back to the reservoir.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.154
After we get her
to a doctor.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.160
No, he's right.
We have to go to the reservoir.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.700
She's right.

02:09.795 --> 02:13.130
Always gotta be
a fucking twist.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.439
In my office,
under my desk, trap door,

02:30.525 --> 02:33.108
Popper 22 to unlock.
Don't put your hand in there.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.819
Temperature's at
absolute zero.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.147
Should slow her down
a bit. Go!

02:38.784 --> 02:39.900
You're okay.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.280
You wanna
hurry that up?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.308
Give her something
for the pain at least!

02:45.332 --> 02:46.948
I just did. Twice.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.043
- Damn it.
- Here, my last one. Use it on her.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.357
You'll be okay.
Stay with me.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.417
Thank you, Henry.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.168
Restraints, please!

02:55.300 --> 02:56.660
You're okay.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.717
What's happening
to her?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.466
So her body,
which is very weird,

03:00.555 --> 03:01.866
it keeps trying
to close the wound

03:01.890 --> 03:03.051
which is heavily enchanted

03:03.141 --> 03:04.410
because the weapon
was also very weird,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.274
and it just tears itself
right back open again.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.413
Well, make it stop!

03:07.437 --> 03:08.837
I hadn't thought of that,
thank you.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.606
I will use this to
keep her comfortable and...

03:11.692 --> 03:13.524
How long is she
gonna be like this?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.102
We are not in what I would call
charted territory right now.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.901
I think I might know someone.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.570
<i>It was
a difficult choice for Penny 23</i>

03:25.664 --> 03:27.280
to even call upon The Binder.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.705
The Binder was certain, however,
that Penny 23 had made the right choice.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.453
Julia, The Binder explained,

03:33.547 --> 03:37.291
would remain in a cycle of wounding,
agony, for millennia.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.213
Her body required
transformation.

03:42.806 --> 03:43.922
Luckily...

03:44.015 --> 03:48.180
...this was The Binder's expertise.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.332
Well, great.
Let's get on with it.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.916
The Binder
needed direction.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.772
Initiate her long and arduous
journey to full goddesshood

03:57.612 --> 04:00.104
or revert her body
to that of a mere human?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.136
If it was up to me,
that'd be a no-brainer.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.321
Yeah, but it's not.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.030
It should be her choice.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.454
The Binder paused for Julia
to make that choice.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.880
Then dryly noted,
she wasn't in a talking mood.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.963
The Binder assumed he was

04:25.056 --> 04:26.888
speaking with
her husband or master?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.056
No. No!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.726
And yet the decision
had to be made,

04:30.812 --> 04:31.973
surely not,

04:32.063 --> 04:35.352
The Binder reasoned,
by this spinster nursemaid.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.609
Uh, I run this hospital, Book.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.771
Still, and
The Binder replied,

04:40.864 --> 04:43.481
stating the obvious
to the strident female,

04:43.992 --> 04:45.858
someone needed
to choose for Julia.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.407
<i>Reed's Mark.</i>

04:49.498 --> 04:52.457
<i>Best of bad options.
Damage was done.</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:57.374
I'd rather not die,
so it's fine on that level,

04:58.298 --> 04:59.505
but also...

05:00.717 --> 05:03.585
Look, I've no interest
in being Batman,

05:03.678 --> 05:07.297
but there comes a point when even
selfish bros need to mobilize.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.303
Six hedges,
in the last 48 hours,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.851
were pulled into vans
by men wearing gray.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.064
- Woke up at home with Reed's Marks.
- Jesus.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.558
The Library
just stopped pretending.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.268
They're rounding us up.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.399
We need you.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.950
You know what
I wanted to do with my life?

05:29.621 --> 05:30.702
To be?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.750
Penny's goddamn girlfriend.

05:37.295 --> 05:41.039
I acted tough,
but all I wanted was him.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.333
You're human.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.592
I'm weak.

05:46.555 --> 05:50.174
Kady, die when
less people need you.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.559
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.027
Honestly, I feel like
I've been run over

06:04.114 --> 06:07.198
by six or eight trucks,
but I'm fine.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.150
And by fine,
you mean...

06:09.244 --> 06:11.531
What does it look like?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.496
We need to talk
about The Monster.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.495
His sister. I saw her plan,
her goal.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.285
And it's way worse than slaughtering
the entire Library.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.666
They want to take it up
with their parents, the Old Gods.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.664
Wait, what does that
even mean?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.118
I don't know,
and neither does she.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.863
She just knows it would
feel good to kill them

06:26.887 --> 06:29.925
and eradicate us in some sort
of insane nuclear winter

06:30.015 --> 06:31.450
which she could give
negative three shits about.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.386
Do they know how
to get to the Old Gods?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.014
They found a spell,
uh, in the Library.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.640
It opens a door
to their plane.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.101
My guess is The Monster wants
to find his sister,

06:40.191 --> 06:42.399
finish the plan,
kill the Old Gods

06:42.485 --> 06:44.477
or get smashed
to a pulp trying.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.779
That means smash Eliot.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.151
Well, the upside
to them inhabiting our bodies

06:51.244 --> 06:53.486
is she left this
in my pocket.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.743
Whatever's in this
is sure to unlock the door.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.750
Holy shit,
well done.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.378
Well, shit,
I was ready to give up.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.923
Welcome back.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.212
Oh, oh!

07:07.886 --> 07:10.094
- Towel?
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.921
So was it weird
being a fish?

07:12.349 --> 07:16.184
It felt, uh,
very natural.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.311
The weird part was

07:25.904 --> 07:30.740
how you were
so incredibly selfless

07:31.785 --> 07:33.492
and, no offense, sweet.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.030
- Which is...
- Not on brand? I know.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.574
Anyone who
really knows me

07:39.668 --> 07:41.625
knows that I'll do
anything if I love you.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.294
Listen, Hoberman,
don't be stupid.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.006
I'm not actually fun
or easy when I'm in love.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.381
Fun and easy are overrated.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.400
- Oh, Christ. Not my day.
- Oh! Uh...

08:06.945 --> 08:09.358
Oh, hi! Sorry,
I just un-fished.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.939
So, anyone else
super hungry?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.700
I'm craving fish sticks.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.986
Is that weird? You know what?
I'm just gonna go with it.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.583
Where's Eliot?

08:23.211 --> 08:24.327
Did you do it?

08:25.171 --> 08:26.662
We got one so far.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.497
You didn't save Eliot,
did you?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.295
Of course you didn't.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.010
You cocked it up
trying to save Julia.

08:33.304 --> 08:37.217
- That bitch has a bulletproof body.
- Not anymore.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.345
We don't even know
if Eliot's still alive.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.496
Yeah, it was
a shit-show.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.580
You don't even know what
the hell was going on.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.436
You had one fucking job...

08:43.565 --> 08:44.565
Yeah, fuck off, Margo.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.232
Oh, Jesus Herbert
Walker Christ.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.638
You're predictable,
you know that?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.069
Whoa.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.193
- What the shit?
- Oh, my God!

08:53.533 --> 08:56.901
It just came out of me
so strong.

08:56.995 --> 09:02.832
Guys, I think I have
some special fish magicks.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.371
Oh!

09:05.462 --> 09:07.294
Act out, right?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.997
Or you touched the reservoir
and you got dosed up.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.050
Yeah, that makes
a thousand times more sense.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.886
But still pretty
act out worthy, no?

09:20.310 --> 09:23.018
- Hello, Kady.
- How are you, Zelda?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.099
I understand
you're angry.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.274
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.359
Kady...

09:29.444 --> 09:33.779
You piece-of-shit,
pearl-clutching sociopathic...

09:33.948 --> 09:35.564
None of this was
calculated on my part.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.325
Everett...

09:39.037 --> 09:42.951
I have believed in his goodness
for over a century.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.033
Everett is in it
for Everett.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.834
If you are right,
then all the death,

09:51.716 --> 09:53.048
all of it,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.339
it's on my hands.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.053
Look,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.268
I know you're not evil.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.350
Just the definition
of obedience.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.483
I used to be.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.491
Prove it.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.449
Hmm. Man, I'm good.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.951
Yeah.
Great, thanks.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.390
So you...
So you feel okay?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.642
Yeah, thanks.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.316
And by thanks I mean thank you
for deciding that I should age,

10:53.403 --> 10:55.611
grow old, and probably die
from a paper cut.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.697
Oh, yeah, and that I'll never
get to do magic again

10:58.783 --> 11:00.194
because I'm perfect now.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.784
Did Professor Lipson
tell you?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.199
I am perfectly normal.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.788
And we all know magic
doesn't come from normal,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.912
so thank you for
deciding that without me.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.082
I, um...

11:13.965 --> 11:15.627
Have to do that thing.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.302
Look, it was
a shit decision.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.425
- It was my decision.
- I know.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.973
Do you? 'Cause I don't.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.134
I will never know.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.722
I just know that this is
not how it was supposed to be.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.144
Okay, truth,
I was selfish.

11:33.860 --> 11:34.860
You were in pain

11:34.944 --> 11:37.106
and it was never going to stop,
and I couldn't.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.364
And you know what?

11:40.575 --> 11:43.363
I would do it again
to not lose you again.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.001
Wait.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.088
Penny.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.929
You just stay here
and let me be pissed at you.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.633
I can do that.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.191
So Everett
wants to be a god.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.113
And now he's so juiced that

12:22.200 --> 12:24.192
he can just rip the god power
right out of Eliot.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.902
So why don't we
just let him?

12:26.996 --> 12:29.989
So let that psycho book-fondler rip
The Monster out of Eliot

12:30.083 --> 12:31.403
and probably kill him?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.081
Hey, come on.
Where are you going?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.004
She's pissed at me,

12:38.091 --> 12:40.208
but more pissed at herself
for being so pissed.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.667
She's not great
at apologizing,

12:41.761 --> 12:42.821
so she's going to
walk around

12:42.845 --> 12:44.323
until she calms down
and hope I forget.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.431
She's right. Anything where
he could die is off the table.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.014
- Hello.
- Shit! I mean, hi.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.636
Where is my sister?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.139
And where is the scroll?

12:55.233 --> 12:58.271
"The scroll"?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.776
Answer me now.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.173
Um, what does it
look like again?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.233
Ahh!

13:03.992 --> 13:05.858
No.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.950
I don't like you, do I?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.784
I have no idea,

13:15.878 --> 13:21.044
but I can assure you,
you will hate me.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.190
Ahh!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.361
Hello!

13:43.531 --> 13:45.113
Ahh!

13:45.199 --> 13:46.199
You did it.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.992
What an achievement, huh?
Two humans!

13:49.162 --> 13:52.155
Task 764 is usually what trips your kind up.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.991
But, hey, as we say
in Linear Base Binary,

13:55.084 --> 13:57.622
"Infinite time is just
a parabolic lost sock."

13:58.087 --> 13:59.578
Right?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.045
Right?

14:06.262 --> 14:07.878
You do speak

14:07.972 --> 14:09.429
Linear Base Binary,
don't you?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.143
No? Then how did you
complete Task 764

14:14.228 --> 14:16.345
or the rest of the 1,293?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.725
Okay, so we're not
on a quest.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.351
- We were.
- Yeah, last year.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.878
- Crushed it.
- Totally, except for the part

14:20.902 --> 14:22.004
that we're trying
to fix now.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.235
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.507
How do you have the
Resonant Singularity Scroll?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.648
Kind of by accident.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.447
My fish magicks
went off and...

14:30.536 --> 14:31.743
No, don't.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.406
I was not trained
for this eventuality.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.328
We just want to talk
to an Old God.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.212
Do you now?

14:42.048 --> 14:45.257
Let me explain this in a way
that you might understand.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.509
A chihuahua

14:48.388 --> 14:51.096
just demanded a blowjob
from an archangel.

14:51.641 --> 14:56.511
Hmm? Also I am not
explaining fish magicks to my bosses.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.522
It's a real...

14:58.606 --> 14:59.972
Also

15:00.108 --> 15:02.316
tee time.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.192
No, come on.
No, hang on! Hang on.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.198
Look, we need the Old Gods,
but they need us too!

15:06.364 --> 15:08.731
Need you? Hubris much?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.775
Five minutes? Please.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.473
So the Old Gods wouldn't maybe
be a little bit motivated to help

15:14.497 --> 15:15.783
once we told them about the...

15:15.873 --> 15:18.866
Not really.
Those monsters...

15:20.128 --> 15:23.087
Sorry nobody told you,
but they can't be killed.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.038
Then why
create them at all?

15:25.133 --> 15:27.295
Why are nickels bigger
than dimes?

15:28.219 --> 15:30.552
Huh. Why are nickels
bigger than dimes?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.318
Stop. Wait,
so there's no way to stop them?

15:32.348 --> 15:34.510
Yes!

15:36.686 --> 15:39.770
You said kill.
They can be stopped.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.473
And can you think
of any good reason

15:42.567 --> 15:46.277
why your bosses
wouldn't want us to do that?

15:46.612 --> 15:50.026
I mean, if they don't
have to actually do anything,

15:50.658 --> 15:52.194
can't hurt.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.947
Okay, boys,
here's my advice.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.658
Drop 'em in the Seam.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.169
The Seam?

16:04.338 --> 16:07.297
This is ridiculous!
You're imbeciles!

16:07.383 --> 16:11.172
Not arguing that,
but the Seam

16:11.471 --> 16:13.337
between what exactly?

16:13.723 --> 16:18.343
This universe and,
you know, the antiverse.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.018
Where everything's all dead?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.686
Oh.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.644
So we go to
the dead-verse?

16:25.151 --> 16:28.235
Duck-on-a-muffin! No!

16:28.529 --> 16:31.567
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.241
And that would be

16:35.077 --> 16:37.114
- where?
- Use your heads, guys.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.245
The Seam's not quite sealed.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.664
What could that mean? Oh!

16:40.750 --> 16:44.039
Maybe it leaked and created
a weird little pocket world

16:44.128 --> 16:46.962
where everything's
all backwards and lifeless.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.497
Like the Mirror World?

16:48.591 --> 16:50.674
Sure, not a bad name.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.631
So you go there,
you find the Seam,

16:53.721 --> 16:55.383
and whatever
you toss in

16:55.473 --> 16:57.465
will never ever
come back out again.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.301
I am insanely late.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.181
Here you go.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.355
To the victors.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.858
Cake.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.781
Okay, but the Mirror Realm's
an entire world.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.444
How are we gonna
find the Seam?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.536
God damn it.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.200
I don't think I could ever eat
non-Old God cake again.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.946
Perfection is a curse.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.291
Oh. Right.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.122
Find the Seam.
Guy didn't say.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.567
We don't have to
go looking for it.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.002
I think I know where it is.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.506
There's this place,
this door,

17:38.599 --> 17:42.183
and what's behind it
felt different.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.514
"Different," like?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.101
Like I knew I shouldn't go near
it even when I was a Niffin.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.051
Well, perfect, we should definitely
all walk right in there.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.482
So according to Fogg,
The Monster's out there right now,

17:52.613 --> 17:54.775
<i>confused for as long
as that spell will last.</i>

17:54.865 --> 17:57.573
23, if you can
travel us out there,

17:57.660 --> 17:59.743
we have an opportunity
to surprise him.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.029
Now this is where we open
up the room for pitches,

18:02.081 --> 18:04.198
because I accidentally lost
all my fish magicks,

18:04.292 --> 18:07.376
and now none of us has
the juice to do the bond.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.043
Well, what about
Dean Fogg?

18:09.130 --> 18:11.050
I mean, he's got to have
an extra battery, right?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.653
Uh, nothing powerful enough.
We asked.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.500
There has to be
something else.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.128
There is.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.839
Hedge witches.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.757
Can barely tie
their shoes.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.058
Fuck you.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.597
And also, you're wrong.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.062
A huge untapped pool.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.684
Look, they're
used to crumbs

18:29.150 --> 18:31.312
and, yes, ambient is low,

18:32.069 --> 18:33.401
but you know
what amplifies it?

18:33.779 --> 18:34.860
Cooperative magic.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.022
We tell everyone,

18:37.366 --> 18:40.450
and I mean all over the world,
wherever there's a pipe,

18:41.412 --> 18:42.448
Fillory, even,

18:43.205 --> 18:46.369
and we all do the same thing
at the same time.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.202
You can't get
that many people to cooperate.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.248
This isn't <i>Sesame Street.</i>

18:51.505 --> 18:53.497
There are
some shitty hedges,

18:54.175 --> 18:56.194
but there are enough good ones
that we could pull this off,

18:56.218 --> 18:57.584
and we need them.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.095
Kady's right,
this is a good idea.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.677
We need a way to get the message
out fast, to time it right.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.453
- Yeah.
- I've got someone who can help.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.469
They'd have to keep casting
the entire time

19:07.104 --> 19:08.665
so we can keep
The Monsters in the bottles

19:08.689 --> 19:10.009
till we get them
through the Seam.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.688
This is right on the hairy edge
of what I'd even call a plan.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.363
Hey, Q,
can we talk for a sec?

19:18.449 --> 19:19.449
Yeah.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.740
I've been thinking...

19:20.826 --> 19:22.533
Me too.
I think that, um,

19:22.620 --> 19:25.112
you should tell me where the Seam is
so that I can do it.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.413
Why you?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.709
Because I'm
better equipped to...

19:33.881 --> 19:35.713
Because
I want you to be safe.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.882
I want you to be safe.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.308
- Are you saying that you...
- No, I'm saying that we've...

19:51.273 --> 19:54.061
We've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

19:54.151 --> 19:56.268
with mixed results.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.068
Yeah. Sure, but I...

20:01.158 --> 20:02.774
I've been thinking
about what works best,

20:03.494 --> 20:07.078
and I think... No, I know
we are best when we're a team.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.658
Okay, when me
and you together.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.871
If nothing else,
I like the sound of it.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.502
Because it's true.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.630
So it's decided?

20:22.263 --> 20:25.552
Okay, people,
let's do this.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.348
If you need to touch butts,
make it quick,

20:27.435 --> 20:29.597
we got a multiverse to save.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.437
How does she
know our thing?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.573
Stop
torturing yourself.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.496
- I want to help.
- Julia, it's gonna be okay.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.086
Or it won't.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.374
You're just zen because
you think this is it.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.382
What other Penny told you,
some big thing you have to do.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.346
No.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.391
I'm zen 'cause there's a lot
scarier shit than dying.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.011
And right now,
I'm looking at you, so I'm good.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.018
Bye, Julia.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.779
Bye.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.038
There's something
I want you to know, sister.

21:40.549 --> 21:46.420
This world, it's not just the bad things
or the ones who wronged us.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.549
There is...

21:51.310 --> 21:56.021
There is such beauty
in everything.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.439
Even the quiet,

21:59.819 --> 22:01.811
especially the quiet.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.461
Hey!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.042
Hey, motherfucker!

22:31.517 --> 22:32.758
Eliot.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.638
Eliot?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.261
Eliot, stay with me.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.777
Now!

22:46.031 --> 22:47.192
Eliot!

22:57.126 --> 23:02.713
<i>Ooh</i>

23:02.798 --> 23:06.508
<i>All this time when we walk</i>

23:06.594 --> 23:10.087
<i>We won't feel</i>

23:10.180 --> 23:13.639
<i>But sometime in a box</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:17.845
<i>It won't steal you</i>

23:17.938 --> 23:20.931
<i>Oh, this time when I walk</i>

23:21.025 --> 23:24.985
<i>I won't feel, I won't feel</i>

23:25.070 --> 23:28.404
<i>Oh, this time when I talk</i>

23:28.490 --> 23:32.484
<i>It's not real, it's not real</i>

23:32.578 --> 23:34.865
<i>Not real</i>

23:37.708 --> 23:39.495
Eliot.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.076
If there's a tunnel
with Grandma,

23:41.170 --> 23:42.770
tell her to piss off
and come back to me,

23:42.796 --> 23:44.332
you selfish fuck!
Get back here!

23:45.883 --> 23:46.883
Eliot.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.051
Eliot, please.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.674
Eliot!

23:54.099 --> 23:57.809
Well, when you put it
so sweetly, Bambi, hmm?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.062
Do something, please!

24:01.148 --> 24:02.667
They need all the ambient
for those bottles.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.024
What is the point of being a magician
if you can't use it?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.671
Before I was a magician,
I was a trauma surgeon.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.840
I'm perfectly capable of saving him
the old-fashioned way.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.651
If you need to cry,
go outside.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.867
- They holding?
- Yeah, for now, but we have to hurry.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.061
Okay, home is
right through here.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.980
We do this,
we move quick.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.065
Okay, remember,
no traveling

24:46.402 --> 24:47.893
and no magic.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.398
It goes bad fast here.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.000
- Alice?
- Just give me a sec.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.968
We'll listen
to your gut next time.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.521
It's the lab. Why?

25:30.237 --> 25:31.353
Who cares?

25:38.287 --> 25:39.744
Careful.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.955
That's it.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.626
It's the Seam.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.219
Okay, let's do this.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.691
Okay, let me...

26:16.867 --> 26:17.867
Everett.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.413
Quentin...

26:25.793 --> 26:26.874
That's mine.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.127
Hand it over, please.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.337
You know
you can't cast in here.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.709
I know.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.460
Mutually assured destruction.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.804
Which is why
you'll give it to me.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.024
You tried.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.267
You did. I'm impressed.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.395
But that bond won't hold.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.089
Give it to me before
The Monster gets out

26:57.116 --> 26:59.028
and everything goes
far more shit-shaped.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.359
Quentin, I think
you need to...

27:01.203 --> 27:03.695
Your friend Eliot is safe.
I'll let you go.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.622
Just let me handle this.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.995
You'll become a god.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.953
And you've met gods,
but I won't be like them.

27:11.672 --> 27:15.006
I studied them so I could
do better, be better.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.253
Trust me.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.303
Okay.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.299
Okay, I get it.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.263
Okay.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.107
You always were smarter
than the books gave you credit for.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.978
It'll be okay, Q.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.311
In fact, you'll
go down as a hero.

27:36.947 --> 27:37.983
I'll make sure of it.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.444
Take her, do it now.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.409
No... No!

27:44.288 --> 27:46.048
- What did you do?
- Just some minor mending.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.843
- Quentin!
- Give it to me!

30:17.566 --> 30:18.647
Hey.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.150
Been awhile.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.567
Welcome to the Underworld.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.692
Oh, shit.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.073
Really?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.121
What's this?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.081
Hot chocolate.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.959
I'm dead, but there's still hot chocolate.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.879
That's a good sign.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.434
What did I do?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.018
What do you think
you did?

31:00.359 --> 31:02.817
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.780
This is the part
where I can't lie, right?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.495
I mean, my whole life is...

31:19.252 --> 31:20.288
Revealed.

31:22.798 --> 31:26.041
But it only means anything
if you reveal it to yourself.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.923
Okay.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.096
Um...

31:36.520 --> 31:40.104
Most of my life, I've been
in and out of hospitals and...

31:43.318 --> 31:44.604
You know,

31:45.529 --> 31:47.987
just suicidal thoughts
and notes.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.107
A lot of notes.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.943
Attempts and...

31:57.499 --> 32:00.367
Meds and therapy and then...

32:02.963 --> 32:04.875
Then I found Brakebills.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.296
And all that went away.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.421
I... I...

32:14.141 --> 32:15.552
I thought, but...

32:16.685 --> 32:17.801
But?

32:21.314 --> 32:24.898
Did I do something brave
to save my friends

32:26.361 --> 32:29.104
or did I finally find a way
to kill myself?

32:33.076 --> 32:34.317
Okay.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.160
I can see we're going to need

32:36.246 --> 32:38.112
the deluxe package, which...
It's okay.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.492
No surprise.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.666
Let's go.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.424
I don't know what to say.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.026
I mean, what words
are ever going to...

33:18.038 --> 33:19.620
They won't.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.177
<i>We're talking away</i>

33:44.397 --> 33:47.515
<i>I don't know what I'm to say</i>

33:47.859 --> 33:50.397
<i>I'll say it anyway</i>

33:51.363 --> 33:55.198
<i>Today's another day
to find you</i>

33:55.659 --> 33:57.616
<i>Shying away</i>

33:59.287 --> 34:02.155
<i>I'll be coming
for your love, okay?</i>

34:02.290 --> 34:07.536
<i>Take on me</i>

34:07.754 --> 34:09.585
<i>Take on me</i>

34:09.672 --> 34:14.759
<i>Take me on</i>

34:15.053 --> 34:16.464
<i>Take on me</i>

34:16.804 --> 34:21.550
<i>I'll be gone</i>

34:22.726 --> 34:28.393
<i>In a day or two</i>

34:31.027 --> 34:33.815
<i>So needless to say</i>

34:34.489 --> 34:36.775
<i>I'm odds and ends</i>

34:36.866 --> 34:38.402
<i>But that's me</i>

34:38.493 --> 34:41.076
<i>I'm stumbling away</i>

34:42.080 --> 34:45.539
<i>Slowly learning
that life is okay</i>

34:45.792 --> 34:48.205
<i>Say after me</i>

34:49.337 --> 34:52.920
<i>It's no better to be safe
than sorry</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:57.924
<i>Take on me</i>

34:58.388 --> 35:00.050
<i>Take on me</i>

35:00.181 --> 35:05.301
<i>Take me on</i>

35:05.478 --> 35:07.470
<i>Take on me</i>

35:07.689 --> 35:12.525
<i>I'll be gone</i>

35:13.278 --> 35:19.195
<i>In a day or two</i>

35:34.132 --> 35:35.464
Wow.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.128
Appreciate the level
of sincere grief, dude.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.760
I seem to remember
when I kicked it,

35:43.975 --> 35:45.591
you laughing.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.640
I'm really sorry about that.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.145
It's okay.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.819
I've met you.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.364
I think you know
your answer now.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.861
The story for them,
it's just starting,

36:06.164 --> 36:09.783
but it won't be the same story
because of you.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.452
You didn't just
save their lives,

36:13.338 --> 36:15.250
you changed their lives

36:15.965 --> 36:17.922
as much as they
changed yours.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.585
You didn't want to
leave all that, did you?

36:38.405 --> 36:39.771
It's time to say goodbye.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.277
All right,
just one last look.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.536
<i>Oh, the things that you say</i>

36:47.497 --> 36:49.204
<i>Is it a life</i>

36:49.290 --> 36:54.001
<i>Orjust to play
my worries away?</i>

36:54.713 --> 36:58.457
<i>You're all the things
I've got to remember</i>

36:58.925 --> 37:01.338
<i>Shying away</i>

37:02.595 --> 37:05.554
<i>I'll be coming for you anyway</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:12.888
<i>Take on me</i>

37:13.064 --> 37:18.355
<i>Take me on</i>

37:18.528 --> 37:20.315
<i>Take on me</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:25.617
<i>I'll be gone</i>

37:26.244 --> 37:32.115
<i>In a day or two</i>

37:34.502 --> 37:40.294
<i>I'll be gone</i>

37:40.717 --> 37:44.336
<i>In a day or two</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:47.053
Are they gonna be okay?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.507
Oh, yeah.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.513
Once they reach here,
just fine.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.886
No, up there.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.935
Oh...

37:57.025 --> 37:58.482
Up there.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.152
You'll notice control is done

38:02.238 --> 38:04.696
with the ring finger
positioning.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.115
If you watch...

38:23.593 --> 38:25.209
And the blood, it feels like

38:25.303 --> 38:26.655
we're never going to
get it all out.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.215
Then we tear down
and rebuild,

38:28.389 --> 38:31.302
which is probably
long overdue.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.972
I got here
as fast as I could.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.054
Thank you.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.398
With so few Librarians,
each is precious.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.443
We're lucky you're still here
to run this place.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.563
Oh, no.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.190
No, I can't do that.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.905
Your humility is charming,
but this isn't the time.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.118
I know what I'm capable of,

38:52.997 --> 38:54.454
what I feel...

38:55.375 --> 38:56.786
It should not be me.

38:57.293 --> 39:00.411
I know exactly who we need,
but I'm not sure they...

39:01.089 --> 39:02.830
We need you
to go find someone

39:02.924 --> 39:05.883
and do your very best to convince them
to come and help us.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.169
Alice Quinn.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.386
Eliot and Margo?

39:14.561 --> 39:15.722
Yeah.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.312
Almost kind of funny.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.311
Funny "ha-ha"
or funny "uh-oh"?

39:22.443 --> 39:23.854
<i>God,
this feels so good.</i>

39:24.153 --> 39:25.439
It sure does.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.523
Okay. Let's see what-the-what
with getting un-banished,

39:28.616 --> 39:32.280
my throne back, and my man
for some white-hot grief banging.

39:34.247 --> 39:35.613
I'm sorry.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.164
That came out
way harsher than I thought.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.287
It's okay.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.412
It's going to be weird
for a little while,

39:42.505 --> 39:44.121
so we're just
going to have to...

39:46.718 --> 39:48.050
Margo.

39:54.434 --> 39:58.053
The fuck did they do
to my castle?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.895
Uh, pardon me, sir.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.193
Crazy question,

40:07.196 --> 40:09.984
but Fillory is still ruled
by Acting High King Fen, right?

40:10.325 --> 40:12.612
If this is some
kind of loyalty test...

40:12.785 --> 40:14.196
Uh, no, no. Uh...

40:14.287 --> 40:16.324
We've just been
away for awhile.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.452
The Dark King reigns,
glory to his rule.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.458
High King Fen
and Josh the Fresh Prince

40:21.544 --> 40:23.285
were overthrown
300 years ago.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.079
The gods curse them both.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.668
Have a good day.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.595
The one that I'm the most
worried about is Julia.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.343
I know.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.387
She's fought so hard
for magic.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.064
She's been
in a weird place.

40:44.567 --> 40:48.652
Then she comes to the end
of this crazy journey

40:50.156 --> 40:51.567
and feels at peace.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.782
And magic?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.652
Comes from pain.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.009
Goodbye, Q.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.190
Q, are you doing this?

41:38.913 --> 41:40.154
Holy shit.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.541
I'm doing this.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.396
Did you...
Did you just see that?

42:05.898 --> 42:08.140
- I...
- Yeah.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.270
So what are you
going to do with it?

42:17.452 --> 42:18.943
What happens next?

42:19.746 --> 42:21.829
Learn to love
the mysteries, man.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.789
Can I ask you something?

42:25.209 --> 42:26.700
Yes, I'm nicer.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.370
All that stuff
that we think

42:30.465 --> 42:33.299
protects us or motivates us or
scares us up there,

42:33.384 --> 42:36.377
here it just all falls away.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.305
You're finally just you.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.100
You'll see.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.032
This is as far as
I go, brother.
