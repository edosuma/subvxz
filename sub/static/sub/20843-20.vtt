00:04.141 --> 00:05.578
Welcome to the grand finale

00:05.578 --> 00:07.582
of the world's greatest
cooking competition,

00:07.582 --> 00:10.420
where three of the most talented
and passionate home cooks

00:10.420 --> 00:13.594
in all of America
will enter the culinary ring.

00:13.594 --> 00:15.430
Three will enter,
but only one home cook

00:15.430 --> 00:18.604
will be crowned
America's next MasterChef.

00:24.448 --> 00:26.352
Gordon:
<i>The search for the next</i>
<i>MasterChef started</i>

00:26.352 --> 00:28.290
<i>with thousands of hopeful</i>
<i>home cooks</i>

00:28.290 --> 00:30.460
<i>from all across the country.</i>

00:30.460 --> 00:33.300
‐ <i>We invited the very best...</i>
‐ Let's go, guys, push it.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.170
<i>to battle it out</i>
<i>for a coveted MasterChef</i>
<i>white apron.</i>

00:35.170 --> 00:36.840
What up, people?

00:36.840 --> 00:38.711
<i>Once that white apron</i>
<i>was in their hands,</i>

00:38.711 --> 00:41.482
<i>the home cooks began</i>
<i>the journey of a lifetime.</i>

00:41.482 --> 00:43.988
Gordon:
Our lifeguards are arriving!

00:43.988 --> 00:46.860
‐ Whoo!
‐ <i>The challenges were more</i>
difficult than ever before.

00:50.334 --> 00:52.739
‐ Ah!
‐ <i>And the pressure</i>
<i>was off the charts.</i>

00:52.739 --> 00:54.342
Get 'em in the fryer.
Let's go!

00:54.342 --> 00:55.344
I'm not gonna finish this.
There's not enough.

00:55.344 --> 00:57.348
There's not ( bleep ) enough!

00:57.348 --> 01:00.220
<i>This year, the home cooks</i>
<i>were treated to master class</i>

01:00.220 --> 01:01.624
<i>after master class.</i>

01:01.624 --> 01:03.293
‐ On the menu tonight, lamb.
‐ Oh!

01:03.293 --> 01:05.632
<i>They learned</i>
<i>from the very best...</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:07.535
‐ Even pressure is key.
‐ <i>...us.</i>

01:07.535 --> 01:10.508
Those cactus spikes need
to be removed very carefully.

01:10.508 --> 01:13.547
<i>They survived intense</i>
<i>"MasterChef" team challenges.</i>

01:13.547 --> 01:16.820
Smarten up and treat these
dishes as your best dishes
you've ever cooked.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.559
A five‐star hotel
and we serve them that?

01:19.559 --> 01:21.329
Oh, my God.

01:21.329 --> 01:25.003
The level of talent
set the bar higher
than ever before.

01:25.003 --> 01:27.007
You knocked it out of the park.
Incredible job.

01:27.007 --> 01:28.376
‐ Thank you.
‐ Gordon: It's breathtaking.

01:28.376 --> 01:30.414
‐ There's no stopping you
right now, is there?
‐ Not at all.

01:30.414 --> 01:33.353
<i>And now only three</i>
<i>home cooks remain</i>

01:33.353 --> 01:35.892
<i>in the search</i>
<i>for the very best.</i>

01:35.892 --> 01:38.296
<i>Three home cooks</i>
<i>will step into the ring</i>

01:38.296 --> 01:39.298
<i>for the grand finale.</i>

01:39.298 --> 01:42.872
But only one will become
America's MasterChef.

01:47.381 --> 01:50.420
Up first in this three‐way
culinary battle...

01:50.420 --> 01:52.391
Jason.

01:52.391 --> 01:55.397
A 34‐year‐old high school
music teacher

01:55.397 --> 01:57.401
from Newton, Massachusetts.

01:59.906 --> 02:03.246
<i>From day one, Jason proved</i>
<i>he could put together dishes</i>

02:03.246 --> 02:05.518
<i>as beautifully as he can</i>
<i>a piece of music.</i>

02:05.518 --> 02:08.389
‐ The flavor of the scallop
is mind‐blowing.
‐ Thank you.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.360
<i>Jason's love of food</i>
<i>burst through</i>

02:10.360 --> 02:11.897
<i>in every dish he made.</i>

02:11.897 --> 02:15.237
What you have brought forward
is a true masterpiece.

02:15.237 --> 02:16.874
‐ Thank you, Chef.
Thank you very much.
‐ Nice job, sir.

02:16.874 --> 02:18.611
<i>He took the judges'</i>
<i>feedback to heart</i>

02:18.611 --> 02:21.249
<i>and presented every dish</i>
<i>with a smile.</i>

02:21.249 --> 02:24.556
I've never seen
a smile so wide ever.

02:24.556 --> 02:27.729
<i>He quickly became</i>
<i>a force to be reckoned with</i>
<i>in this competition.</i>

02:27.729 --> 02:29.265
‐ Jason.
‐ Way to go, Jason!

02:29.265 --> 02:30.968
‐ Jason.
‐ All right.

02:30.968 --> 02:32.739
‐ Red Team.
‐ Yeah!

02:32.739 --> 02:35.611
<i>A heartfelt teacher</i>
<i>and an even better student,</i>

02:35.611 --> 02:38.283
<i>he's hit all the right notes</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

02:38.283 --> 02:40.420
I think you just cooked
the dish of the competition.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.424
‐ It's beautiful.
‐ Thank you.

02:42.424 --> 02:43.761
I've had a very strong
performance

02:43.761 --> 02:45.765
in the MasterChef kitchen.
I'm ready to bring it.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.769
<i>I'm going to present</i>
<i>a beautiful symphony</i>

02:47.769 --> 02:50.106
<i>of flavors and textures</i>
<i>and colors on my plates,</i>

02:50.106 --> 02:52.277
and I'm going to win
the next MasterChef trophy.

02:57.454 --> 03:00.561
The first hurdle that stands
in Jason's way tonight

03:00.561 --> 03:02.297
is Eboni...

03:04.401 --> 03:06.740
...a 33‐year‐old
addictions counselor

03:06.740 --> 03:08.911
and a military wife
from Chicago, Illinois.

03:10.948 --> 03:13.319
‐ <i>Eboni is a fierce</i>
<i>competitor...</i>
‐ Yeah!

03:13.319 --> 03:15.925
<i>who has overcome so many</i>
<i>obstacles throughout her life.</i>

03:15.925 --> 03:19.766
I am a survivor.
I'm from the dead‐ass hood,
the south side of Chicago.

03:19.766 --> 03:23.941
<i>In the kitchen,</i>
<i>she's always pushed herself</i>
<i>to be the best she could be.</i>

03:23.941 --> 03:25.243
Your dish is delicious.
Let's get that right.

03:25.243 --> 03:27.849
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ You just cooked
like a chef's dream.

03:27.849 --> 03:29.953
<i>Her desire to be</i>
<i>the next MasterChef</i>

03:29.953 --> 03:32.457
<i>is fueled by a great love</i>
<i>for her husband</i>

03:32.457 --> 03:33.493
<i>and her four children.</i>

03:33.493 --> 03:35.463
What does breakfast usually
look like at home?

03:35.463 --> 03:37.702
I'll do something like biscuits
or I'll do waffles.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.539
And then do all that
and turn around and go
right to work.

03:39.539 --> 03:42.010
<i>Eboni's food has always been</i>
<i>packed with flavor.</i>

03:44.816 --> 03:47.655
<i>And her big and bold dishes</i>

03:47.655 --> 03:49.526
<i>helped secure Eboni's place</i>
<i>in the finale tonight.</i>

03:49.526 --> 03:51.362
‐ The Red Team.
‐ Yeah!

03:51.362 --> 03:53.499
‐ Congratulations, Eboni.
‐ Yes.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.403
Eboni.
Well done.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.840
Eboni:
<i>I fought my way</i>
<i>into the finale.</i>

03:56.840 --> 03:58.009
and I'm prepared to bring it.

03:58.009 --> 04:00.013
<i>I'ma work my way</i>
<i>right through that kitchen</i>

04:00.013 --> 04:01.349
<i>and take that trophy</i>

04:01.349 --> 04:02.284
'cause it's mine.

04:05.357 --> 04:07.662
Look at your mommy. Whoo!

04:07.662 --> 04:11.335
Our final home cook battling
for the win tonight

04:11.335 --> 04:13.373
is Dino...

04:15.644 --> 04:19.051
...a 28‐year‐old dancer
from Bensonhurst, New York.

04:22.024 --> 04:25.030
<i>Dino was a dark horse</i>
<i>who danced his way</i>
<i>into the kitchen,</i>

04:25.030 --> 04:29.038
<i>but he soon established</i>
<i>his place as a headline act.</i>

04:29.038 --> 04:32.545
Wow.
That looks like an Italian
grandma made them.

04:32.545 --> 04:36.185
‐ Ow!
‐ <i>His eccentricities on a plate</i>
<i>have sometimes missed.</i>

04:36.185 --> 04:39.024
It looks like the remains
of my nana's ashes.

04:39.024 --> 04:42.431
<i>But more often than not,</i>
<i>they have blown us away.</i>

04:42.431 --> 04:45.070
It shouldn't work,
but it's pretty brilliant.

04:45.070 --> 04:48.544
<i>He uses his artistic</i>
<i>and often unconventional eye</i>

04:48.544 --> 04:51.883
<i>and Italian background</i>
<i>to create beautiful</i>
<i>and delicious plates.</i>

04:51.883 --> 04:54.421
‐ Christina: It's amazing.
‐ Thank you so much.

04:54.421 --> 04:55.891
I'd be scared for
anyone else out there.

04:55.891 --> 04:58.730
<i>Dino kept his focus</i>
<i>throughout the competition</i>

04:58.730 --> 05:00.835
<i>and let his passion propel him</i>
<i>to the finale.</i>

05:00.835 --> 05:02.572
‐ Dino.
‐ Well done.

05:02.572 --> 05:05.544
‐ Congratulations, Dino.
‐ Ow!

05:05.544 --> 05:07.013
‐ Red Team.
‐ Yeah!

05:07.013 --> 05:08.116
Oh, my God!

05:08.116 --> 05:11.422
I've been very underestimated
in this competition,

05:11.422 --> 05:14.027
<i>but I've proven myself</i>
<i>to be the best of the best.</i>

05:14.027 --> 05:16.533
<i>I'm ready to bring my flair</i>
<i>to a whole new level.</i>

05:16.533 --> 05:18.069
I will be the next MasterChef.

05:26.418 --> 05:28.557
Welcome.

05:28.557 --> 05:32.430
Congratulations.
This is the moment
you've been waiting for,

05:32.430 --> 05:35.069
the "MasterChef" grand finale.

05:35.069 --> 05:38.610
Throughout this competition,
you've had a lot of obstacles
thrown your way,

05:38.610 --> 05:40.814
including extremely
talented opponents.

05:40.814 --> 05:44.087
But tonight, they've
returned to cheer you on.

05:44.087 --> 05:47.628
( cheering )

05:47.628 --> 05:50.099
Woohoo!

05:50.099 --> 05:52.437
‐ ( shouting )
‐ Whoo!

05:54.609 --> 05:58.617
Jason, Eboni, and Dino,
we know you sacrificed
so much to be here,

05:58.617 --> 06:01.121
including time
with your family and friends.

06:01.121 --> 06:04.461
So tonight we are honored
to have them here in the kitchen

06:04.461 --> 06:08.469
supporting you all
on the biggest night
of your culinary lives.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.908
( cheering )

06:12.912 --> 06:16.820
Jason, you have your mom, Eva,
your dad, John,

06:16.820 --> 06:18.155
your brother, Kevin,

06:18.155 --> 06:20.460
and of course,
your partner, Nathan.

06:20.460 --> 06:24.502
Mom, Miss Eva, how proud are you
of your son Jason right now?

06:24.502 --> 06:27.608
The whole family
are so excited for him.

06:27.608 --> 06:29.646
Now, some of
that cooking ability,
does that come from you?

06:29.646 --> 06:34.789
‐ Let's be honest.
‐ Well, to be honest,
we butt heads in the kitchen.

06:34.789 --> 06:37.027
There are time I said,
"You're too slow."

06:37.027 --> 06:39.999
( laughter )

06:39.999 --> 06:42.003
Now, Eboni,
tonight to support you,

06:42.003 --> 06:43.507
you have your husband,
Horatio,

06:43.507 --> 06:45.511
you have your four
amazing children,

06:45.511 --> 06:50.320
Symphony, Melody, Robert,
and your young son, Amir.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.690
Crowd: Aww.

06:51.690 --> 06:54.696
Horatio, you know,
your incredible service

06:54.696 --> 06:57.067
to the Navy takes you
away from home.

06:57.067 --> 06:59.204
What's it been like over
the last three or four months

06:59.204 --> 07:01.475
without this one at home?

07:01.475 --> 07:03.479
Well, I really appreciate
what she does.

07:03.479 --> 07:05.651
It's been a role reversal.
Usually I'm the one always
deployed and gone.

07:05.651 --> 07:09.157
So for me to be home
taking care of business
with four children,

07:09.157 --> 07:11.028
I realize how much work it is.
We really miss her.

07:11.028 --> 07:15.169
Crowd: Aww.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.706
And, Dino,
your parents are here

07:16.706 --> 07:19.010
to cheer you on,
Susan and Mark.

07:19.010 --> 07:23.185
Mark, do you have a favorite
dish that Dino's ever cooked?

07:23.185 --> 07:25.557
Well, I've been having
to watch what I eat lately,

07:25.557 --> 07:27.193
I've been eating
a lot of meats and stuff,

07:27.193 --> 07:30.667
so one morning he came in
and cooked this veggie burrito.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.571
And he asked me if I wanted one,
and I said sure.

07:32.571 --> 07:34.675
And he made it for me,
and it was outstanding.

07:34.675 --> 07:36.713
It was delicious. I said,
"I don't need meat anymore.

07:36.713 --> 07:38.583
I'll just take
a veggie burrito now."

07:41.890 --> 07:45.196
Tonight, we have
three home cooks entering
the grand finale.

07:45.196 --> 07:50.574
And we have four judges.

07:50.574 --> 07:53.613
Tonight we're adding
another palate to the roster.

07:53.613 --> 07:55.951
And not just any palate,

07:55.951 --> 07:58.088
one of the world's
most refined.

07:58.088 --> 08:01.696
He runs one of the biggest
food empires on the planet.

08:01.696 --> 08:04.569
He's one of the world's
most successful restauranteurs.

08:04.569 --> 08:08.610
And some say that he makes me
look like a pussycat.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.012
Be afraid.

08:10.012 --> 08:12.217
Be very afraid.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.854
Joining us tonight
in the MasterChef kitchen,

08:13.854 --> 08:18.730
back where
he truly belongs...

08:18.730 --> 08:22.605
please welcome back
the one and only...

08:22.605 --> 08:25.944
‐ Joe Bastianich.
‐ Oh, my God.

08:25.944 --> 08:29.719
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

08:29.719 --> 08:30.721
Gordon: Man!

08:33.760 --> 08:37.735
The Joe Bastianich,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:37.735 --> 08:40.807
I am about to pee my pants.
Are you kidding me?

08:40.807 --> 08:43.078
<i>Joe is here at</i>
<i>the "MasterChef"</i>
<i>season eight finale.</i>

08:43.078 --> 08:44.916
Y'all tripping.

08:44.916 --> 08:48.289
Now, Joe Bastianich runs
an empire that includes
over 30 restaurants.

08:48.289 --> 08:51.663
He's also a winemaker,
an author, and of course,

08:51.663 --> 08:54.301
he'll always be part
of the "MasterChef" family.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.604
Joe, as always,
it's so good to see you.

08:55.604 --> 08:57.808
‐ Good to be back.
Good to be back.
‐ Have you missed me?

08:57.808 --> 08:59.779
‐ No.
‐ ( laughter )

08:59.779 --> 09:04.789
But what I did miss
is the incredible energy
and passion

09:04.789 --> 09:07.293
of the home cooks
in this great competition.

09:07.293 --> 09:10.634
( cheering )

09:14.675 --> 09:16.244
Aarón: Home cooks,
the pressure tonight

09:16.244 --> 09:18.650
is greater than you've
ever experienced.

09:18.650 --> 09:24.327
And four judges means we want
to see four perfect plates
for each course.

09:24.327 --> 09:29.337
One appetizer, one entree,
and one incredible dessert.

09:29.337 --> 09:32.310
Now, are you all ready
for the most important cook
of your lives?

09:32.310 --> 09:33.278
All: Yes, Chef.

09:33.278 --> 09:35.717
You'll each have ten minutes
in the pantry

09:35.717 --> 09:37.655
to collect everything
you need

09:37.655 --> 09:42.731
to cook us the best
three‐course dinner
of your life.

09:42.731 --> 09:44.835
Your time in the pantry...

09:44.835 --> 09:46.673
starts...

09:49.879 --> 09:51.849
...now.

09:51.849 --> 09:54.220
Yeah, baby! Go for it!
Go, go, go!

09:54.220 --> 09:57.160
Yeah! Yeah! Yes, yes!

09:57.160 --> 10:01.068
There's no more challenges.
There's no more battles.
This is it.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.738
Oh, my gosh.

10:02.738 --> 10:05.711
My money's on the music.
It's gotta be Jason.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.848
<i>He has</i>
<i>the most amazing ideas.</i>

10:07.848 --> 10:10.721
<i>His plating is beautiful.</i>

10:10.721 --> 10:13.760
‐ <i>And his flavors</i>
<i>are always on point.</i>
‐ Watermelon radish.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.031
<i>If he does not get into</i>
<i>his own head,</i>

10:16.031 --> 10:18.803
he will be
the next MasterChef.

10:18.803 --> 10:20.072
Jackpot.

10:20.072 --> 10:22.110
I think Eboni
is gonna win tonight.

10:22.110 --> 10:25.049
‐ She is my girl from Chicago.
‐ A little honey.

10:25.049 --> 10:26.318
<i>She is just so strong.</i>

10:26.318 --> 10:29.558
<i>And she has overcome so much</i>
<i>in this competition.</i>

10:29.558 --> 10:31.394
<i>It's just gonna give her</i>
<i>everything she needs</i>

10:31.394 --> 10:32.765
<i>to bring it all together</i>

10:32.765 --> 10:34.568
and win
the MasterChef trophy.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.238
Where'd you go, baby?

10:36.238 --> 10:39.410
‐ Dino and I
are oil and water.
‐ Veggies.

10:39.410 --> 10:42.316
<i>He's not my favorite person</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

10:42.316 --> 10:45.422
But I'm rooting for him.

10:45.422 --> 10:49.999
<i>Dino, each step of the way,</i>
<i>has gotten better.</i>

10:49.999 --> 10:54.107
<i>And he's gonna take chances</i>
<i>that the other two competitors</i>
<i>are not going to do.</i>

10:54.107 --> 10:56.813
And if he can really
capitalize on those risks,

10:56.813 --> 10:57.948
great rewards will come.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.787
‐ Come on, speed up, guys.
‐ Come on!

11:02.891 --> 11:05.730
‐ Christina:
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
‐ Come on.

11:08.302 --> 11:10.306
Gordon:
Jason, Eboni, and Dino,

11:10.306 --> 11:13.478
it's now time to put together
the best three‐course dinner

11:13.478 --> 11:15.784
you've ever dreamt of

11:15.784 --> 11:18.088
and we've ever eaten.

11:18.088 --> 11:21.428
First up, the appetizers.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.800
Jason, what will you be making
for your appetizer?

11:23.800 --> 11:27.875
For my appetizer,
I will be making an uni custard

11:27.875 --> 11:29.979
with poached prawns,
little neck clams,

11:29.979 --> 11:32.283
and a Meyer lemon
miso vinaigrette.

11:32.283 --> 11:34.822
Eboni, what will you be making
for your appetizer?

11:34.822 --> 11:38.028
I'm gonna make pan‐seared
scallops with charred Romanesco,

11:38.028 --> 11:41.201
English peas,
and rainbow chard sauté

11:41.201 --> 11:42.971
with a garden pea puree.

11:42.971 --> 11:45.877
And, Dino, what are
gonna be making
for your appetizer?

11:45.877 --> 11:50.019
For my appetizer,
I will be making a capellini
nero diavolo di mare,

11:50.019 --> 11:53.893
or a squid ink angel hair pasta
with a spicy sauce

11:53.893 --> 11:55.496
and clams and calamari.

11:55.496 --> 11:59.003
It's time for the "MasterChef"
finale to officially begin.

11:59.003 --> 12:00.907
Are all three of you ready?

12:00.907 --> 12:02.511
All: Yes, Chef.

12:02.511 --> 12:06.986
You'll have
just one hour to make
your amazing appetizers.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.525
Four plates of each.
Do not let us down.

12:09.525 --> 12:12.898
Your time starts...

12:12.898 --> 12:14.133
...now.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.870
( cheers, applause )

12:15.870 --> 12:17.975
Let's go.

12:17.975 --> 12:19.878
‐ Dino! Come on, Dino.
‐ You got it, Jason!

12:19.878 --> 12:21.314
Go, Jason! Go, Jason!

12:21.314 --> 12:24.855
Cate:
Come on, Eboni! Whoo!

12:24.855 --> 12:27.527
Wow, I can't believe it.
This is it.

12:27.527 --> 12:30.867
We have definitely got
the three best amateur cooks
in America tonight

12:30.867 --> 12:34.240
going head to head
in this incredible
three‐way finale.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.011
Three incredible‐sounding
appetizers.

12:36.011 --> 12:40.219
This is the finale that
America's been waiting for.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.390
‐ Come on, guys, let's go.
‐ You guys can do it. Go!

12:50.974 --> 12:52.911
Gordon:
Wow, I can't believe it.
This is it.

12:52.911 --> 12:55.550
Three amazing,
talented home cooks

12:55.550 --> 12:58.956
and you cannot get
three more different individuals

12:58.956 --> 13:00.459
anywhere in
this country tonight.

13:00.459 --> 13:04.000
‐ Eboni, it's hot in here.
‐ It's hot in here, baby.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.006
It's incredible
to have such diversity here
in the MasterChef kitchen.

13:07.006 --> 13:08.910
Completely different
backgrounds,

13:08.910 --> 13:10.880
completely different
cooking styles,

13:10.880 --> 13:13.553
and I am excited
to taste this food.

13:13.553 --> 13:15.523
‐ Whoo! Yes, Jason.
‐ Bam.

13:15.523 --> 13:19.430
Jason doing a sea urchin custard
almost like a savory flan.

13:19.430 --> 13:22.069
And it's being topped
with prawns as well
as some fresh uni on top.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.240
Gordon:
That's a high‐end appetizer.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.044
It's steamed for about
eight to nine minutes.

13:26.044 --> 13:29.050
Then it's set,
but let me tell you something.

13:29.050 --> 13:32.557
Ten seconds over‐steamed
and that thing turns into
cold scrambled eggs.

13:32.557 --> 13:35.229
So he has to be
careful tonight.

13:35.229 --> 13:37.099
Come on, Eboni!

13:37.099 --> 13:38.970
I have high hopes
for Eboni's dish.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.074
She is going for
a classic combination

13:41.074 --> 13:42.309
with her appetizer tonight,

13:42.309 --> 13:45.115
seared scallops and cheese,
one of my favorite combinations,

13:45.115 --> 13:46.484
especially to
start off a meal.

13:46.484 --> 13:47.988
It's light, it's sweet,
it's bright.

13:47.988 --> 13:52.096
She is bringing in a little
charred Romanesco cauliflower
for an edge,

13:52.096 --> 13:52.998
some rainbow chard.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.269
The cook on those scallops
are pivotal.

13:55.269 --> 13:58.141
30 seconds over,
you've got a mouthful
of rubber bands.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.312
Perfect,
and it's a showstopper.

14:00.312 --> 14:02.951
All right, Dino!
Come on. You can do this.

14:02.951 --> 14:04.955
Christina:
Dino's appetizer's
a squid ink pasta.

14:04.955 --> 14:07.226
I love seeing pasta
as an appetizer, right?

14:07.226 --> 14:09.631
‐ Yeah.
‐ He's folding into
that calamari,

14:09.631 --> 14:12.571
cherry tomatoes,
some beautiful
little neck clams.

14:12.571 --> 14:14.440
Something that
is very classic Italian,

14:14.440 --> 14:16.244
but with a little bit
of a Dino twist.

14:16.244 --> 14:20.018
Now squid ink pasta
is a tricky one, right?

14:20.018 --> 14:22.022
A home cook like Dino
needs to understand

14:22.022 --> 14:24.327
the squid ink is not
just color.

14:24.327 --> 14:26.599
It's flavoring.
It's a component of the dish.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.504
‐ Aarón: Yep.
‐ And can really complement
a nice brothy clam sauce.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.441
He's playing at a high level.
It's a big risk.

14:31.441 --> 14:36.451
Just over 46 minutes remaining.
Let's go.

14:36.451 --> 14:39.457
‐ Right. How are you feeling
‐ How are you?
I'm feeling great.

14:39.457 --> 14:41.795
‐ What's up, Jason?
Nice to meet you.
‐ Hello, Chef. Hello.

14:41.795 --> 14:44.066
So what do you got
going on today?

14:44.066 --> 14:45.670
‐ I'm making an uni custard,
chawanmushi.
‐ Yeah.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.641
‐ I'm making the dashi broth
right now.
‐ Okay.

14:47.641 --> 14:49.310
Why custard
on such a big night?

14:49.310 --> 14:51.147
I just love
the texture of it

14:51.147 --> 14:53.018
and I thought it
would really highlight
the sweetness of the uni.

14:53.018 --> 14:56.525
But it's so chef‐y. I love it,
but I'm nervous about it.

14:56.525 --> 14:58.094
Joe:
Last time I had
a dish like this,

14:58.094 --> 15:00.165
I was in Singapore
a three‐star Michelin
restaurant.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.038
‐ Sure.
‐ Is this really part
of your cultural heritage

15:03.038 --> 15:04.473
or are you blowing
smoke up my ass?

15:04.473 --> 15:06.444
This is something
that I would love
to eat myself.

15:06.444 --> 15:09.016
‐ I would order it on a menu.
‐ If this is a bluff,

15:09.016 --> 15:10.653
you're gonna be out the door
in about one second.

15:10.653 --> 15:12.022
‐ Understood.
‐ Told you he was friendly.

15:12.022 --> 15:14.327
‐ Good luck.
‐ ( laughs )

15:14.327 --> 15:17.499
Just 30 minutes to go
in your appetizer course,
guys, come on!

15:17.499 --> 15:19.470
Aarón:
Halfway done, guys.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.476
‐ Go, Mom!
‐ Aarón: Eboni?

15:22.476 --> 15:23.546
‐ Christina:
Hi, Eboni! How's it going?
‐ Good.

15:23.546 --> 15:26.317
What are you bringing
to this appetizer course?

15:26.317 --> 15:28.188
You know my husband's
Indian and Jamaican,

15:28.188 --> 15:31.494
so I'm bringing a little bit
America meets island‐style
type cuisine.

15:31.494 --> 15:34.500
What about those scallops?
Now, cooking scallops,
it can be a beautiful thing,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.170
but it's certainly
no easy feat.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.743
Overcook them,
they're rubbery,
they're terrible.

15:38.743 --> 15:41.582
Undercook them,
they're not really
impressive at all.

15:41.582 --> 15:43.418
‐ It's a tall order.
‐ It is.

15:43.418 --> 15:45.222
How are you
thinking through that?

15:45.222 --> 15:47.226
I'm just going by
all the things
I've learned here

15:47.226 --> 15:51.134
watching you guys do demos
and walking me through
different dishes,

15:51.134 --> 15:54.073
and I just gotta go
with what I know, and that's
pleasing you guys' palate.

15:54.073 --> 15:57.212
There's no question that you
were a fighter from day one.

15:57.212 --> 16:00.285
You've been in the bottom
several times throughout
this competition...

16:00.285 --> 16:02.657
‐ That's right.
‐ but you rebounded, you
persevered, you fought back.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.493
And we know
that you're a fighter.

16:04.493 --> 16:05.930
Does that give you
the edge here?

16:05.930 --> 16:08.502
It does give me the edge
'cause what don't kill you
make you stronger,

16:08.502 --> 16:10.673
and if you ain't never been
in a battle, how you know
how to go to war?

16:10.673 --> 16:12.176
‐ Whew!
‐ Keep tasting, young lady.

16:12.176 --> 16:13.579
I will, thank you.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.219
16 minutes to go!

16:17.219 --> 16:19.056
‐ Come on!
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.

16:20.526 --> 16:22.029
Come on, Dino!

16:24.534 --> 16:25.870
‐ Dino.
‐ Hello, Dino, how are you?

16:25.870 --> 16:27.707
‐ Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.
‐ Pleasure, pleasure.

16:27.707 --> 16:29.744
So, you're from
my neck of the woods,
Brooklyn, huh?

16:29.744 --> 16:32.115
‐ Bensonhurst, yeah.
‐ Bensonhurst, oh, my God.

16:32.115 --> 16:33.719
So you cook Italian food,
then, basically.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.121
A little bit.
I mean, half my life
was in California,

16:35.121 --> 16:36.558
so I learned
a lot of everything.

16:36.558 --> 16:41.300
Why squid ink pasta,
knowing that Joe Bastianich
is in the house? Why?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.404
This is the finale.
I ain't gonna go soft.

16:43.404 --> 16:45.743
I gotta give you
something that I didn't do
the whole time, you know?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.179
Like, why would I
give you something easy?

16:47.179 --> 16:48.916
Are you just using
the squid ink for coloring

16:48.916 --> 16:51.153
or do you understand,
like, the flavor component
it can add to the‐‐

16:51.153 --> 16:52.122
Oh, no, there's
a flavor in there.

16:52.122 --> 16:54.260
There's that iron‐y flavor
that it sort of adds

16:54.260 --> 16:56.163
that goes with the lemon,
that goes with sorta
with the seafood pasta,

16:56.163 --> 16:58.669
'cause I used to love
seafood pasta and I love
squid ink pasta,

16:58.669 --> 17:00.673
the narrow sauce that
actually comes with it.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.242
I was messing around one day,
put it all together,

17:02.242 --> 17:03.244
and it actually
tasted quite nice.

17:03.244 --> 17:04.614
If you win MasterChef,

17:04.614 --> 17:06.552
the money, the trophy,
the title‐‐

17:06.552 --> 17:07.620
how's it gonna
change your life?

17:07.620 --> 17:08.722
It's gonna change
my life completely.

17:08.722 --> 17:09.724
What are you gonna do?

17:09.724 --> 17:11.093
I would love to do anything

17:11.093 --> 17:12.764
that could allow me
to help other people.

17:12.764 --> 17:16.237
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Come on, Dino!

17:16.237 --> 17:20.178
So you're motivation to cook
is completely altruistic?

17:20.178 --> 17:21.280
That's the only way I get joy.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.449
I could go surf
for three hours,

17:22.449 --> 17:25.155
I can go dance,
and that keeps me happy
for like a day.

17:25.155 --> 17:27.760
Making other people happy,
making other people
believe in themselves,

17:27.760 --> 17:30.600
feeding people is
the only way I feel happy.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.804
You're the Gandhi
of Bensonhurst.

17:32.804 --> 17:34.173
Gordon:
He is on a mission.

17:34.173 --> 17:37.145
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

17:37.145 --> 17:38.181
‐ Let's go, guys. Come on.
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.

17:38.181 --> 17:39.684
You gotta speed up.

17:43.859 --> 17:45.663
Jason:
<i>I'm a little worried.</i>

17:45.663 --> 17:47.800
I've practiced the custard
for my appetizer

17:47.800 --> 17:49.370
<i>many times at home,</i>

17:49.370 --> 17:50.840
<i>and the consistency</i>
<i>of the liquid</i>

17:50.840 --> 17:53.211
is not quite correct.

17:53.211 --> 17:56.150
Guys, 12 minutes to go.
12 minutes to go.

17:59.223 --> 18:02.295
Right, young man,
where's the custard?

18:02.295 --> 18:03.097
The custard is here.

18:03.097 --> 18:05.603
Do you want it
to be this liquid?

18:05.603 --> 18:06.805
Uh, no, I do not.

18:06.805 --> 18:08.776
It's not gonna hold
its consistency at all.

18:08.776 --> 18:09.844
It's liquid.

18:09.844 --> 18:12.349
The consistency,
I just want to‐‐ yeah.

18:12.349 --> 18:14.854
You know, if you call
something a custard, it needs
to be a custard, my friend.

18:14.854 --> 18:15.956
Understood, thank you, Chef.

18:15.956 --> 18:17.292
Wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.

18:17.292 --> 18:19.698
<i>Uh‐oh, this is major trouble.</i>

18:19.698 --> 18:21.333
If my custard
is not set correctly

18:21.333 --> 18:23.337
<i>or the consistency is wrong,</i>

18:23.337 --> 18:26.845
then my appetizer
is sunk for this round.

18:26.845 --> 18:28.882
So the big jeopardy now
with Jason's custard,

18:28.882 --> 18:30.820
if he starts slicing
those shrimp and those clams

18:30.820 --> 18:33.491
‐ and they sit on top
of that custard‐‐
‐ They're gonna drown.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.661
That's not a custard.
That's a soup.

18:35.830 --> 18:37.332
Breathe, Jason, breathe.

18:37.332 --> 18:39.403
If he puts the seafood
in that bowl

18:39.403 --> 18:41.240
and they sink
into that custard,

18:41.240 --> 18:42.677
‐ Game over.
‐ then he's made soup,

18:42.677 --> 18:45.516
and game over,
and he's out.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.219
Oh, my God.

18:52.229 --> 18:55.268
‐ You got this, Jason.
‐ Breathe, Jason, breathe.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.038
If he puts the seafood
in that bowl

18:57.038 --> 18:58.876
and they sink
into that custard,

18:58.876 --> 19:00.378
‐ Game over.
‐ then he's made soup,

19:00.378 --> 19:03.184
and game over,
and he's out.

19:03.184 --> 19:07.325
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Nice and relaxed.

19:07.325 --> 19:10.198
Cate: Yes, Jason!
Beautiful!

19:10.198 --> 19:13.237
You got it, Jason!
We're proud of you, Jason!

19:13.237 --> 19:16.243
He's put the seafood
into the custard
and it didn't sink through.

19:16.243 --> 19:18.381
Now I thought it would've
sunk into it like a soup,

19:18.381 --> 19:20.418
which means it's already
firmer than I thought.

19:20.418 --> 19:22.690
The question is,
is it just the skin on top

19:22.690 --> 19:24.026
and soup on the bottom?

19:24.026 --> 19:25.696
Or is it firm throughout?

19:25.696 --> 19:28.869
We are down to
five minutes remaining.

19:28.869 --> 19:30.706
‐ Come on!
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.

19:30.706 --> 19:32.610
‐ This is it.
‐ Push, guys, push.

19:32.610 --> 19:34.614
Gordon:
You want this. Come on!

19:34.614 --> 19:36.885
Taste everything.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.724
‐ Come on!
‐ Let's go!

19:39.724 --> 19:42.395
‐ Come on, Dino.
‐ All right, Jason.
All right, Jason.

19:42.395 --> 19:44.567
All right, Jason.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.405
Mark:
Scallops are beautiful.

19:47.405 --> 19:49.777
‐ Beautiful, Dino!
‐ You got it, Jason!

19:49.777 --> 19:52.917
‐ Come on, guys!
‐ You got this, Eboni!

19:52.917 --> 19:54.821
‐ Christina,
who's looking strong?
‐ Eboni, all the way home.

19:54.821 --> 19:57.359
Horatio:
Beautiful colors, Eboni.
Beautiful colors.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.996
She's only putting on a plate
what needs to be there.

19:58.996 --> 20:01.467
Dino:
Ooh, baby.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.037
Joe: You know,
I think Dino's pasta's
really looking quite good.

20:03.037 --> 20:07.012
I mean, it's not exactly
like you would expect it
in the Italian vernacular.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.483
Oh, baby doll, all right.

20:09.483 --> 20:11.788
But he's made it its own.
He seemed to be doing
all the right things.

20:11.788 --> 20:14.661
‐ I can't wait to taste it.
‐ Aarón: For me, it's Jason.

20:14.661 --> 20:16.463
I think the sea urchin custard
is coming together lovely.

20:16.463 --> 20:18.702
He's cut all the different
garnishes in such a way

20:18.702 --> 20:20.038
that they're
consistent in size

20:20.038 --> 20:21.975
and they're gonna make
a huge impact visually.

20:21.975 --> 20:26.851
We are down
to 60 seconds remaining.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.487
‐ Come on!
‐ Go, Mama!

20:28.487 --> 20:31.360
‐ ( cheering continues )
‐ Come on, Jason!

20:31.360 --> 20:33.732
‐ This is it.
‐ Come on, guys!

20:33.732 --> 20:36.036
‐ Come on, guys, let's go!
‐ Finish strong!

20:36.036 --> 20:39.711
All:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

20:39.711 --> 20:44.721
six, five, four, three,
two, one.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.390
Gordon:
Stop! Hands in the air!

20:46.390 --> 20:49.096
( cheers, applause )

20:51.534 --> 20:52.770
Well done!

20:55.576 --> 20:57.880
All three of you,
bring those incredible
appetizers

20:57.880 --> 20:59.216
round to the front.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.086
Let's go.

21:08.502 --> 21:12.710
So, three wildly
different appetizers.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.179
They all look beautiful.

21:14.179 --> 21:17.686
But as we always say,
it's all in the taste.

21:17.686 --> 21:21.193
All three of you, follow us.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.397
Jason:
<i>The appetizer round</i>
<i>sets the tone</i>

21:23.397 --> 21:24.867
<i>for the rest of the meal,</i>

21:24.867 --> 21:27.740
so I've made something
that is completely unique.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.476
<i>I'm bringing a fusion</i>

21:29.476 --> 21:32.550
<i>of New England and Asian</i>
<i>inspired flavors.</i>

21:32.550 --> 21:34.887
<i>I think I've made a very,</i>
<i>very solid effort.</i>

21:34.887 --> 21:37.459
<i>I hope the flavors are there,</i>
<i>that the judges appreciate it,</i>

21:37.459 --> 21:40.431
and that I'm able
to leap over Eboni and Dino

21:40.431 --> 21:42.469
<i>for the appetizer round.</i>

21:42.469 --> 21:45.909
Right, let's start off
with Jason.

21:48.949 --> 21:50.752
Thank you.

21:52.255 --> 21:53.491
Thank you.

21:56.096 --> 21:58.100
Please describe
your appetizer.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.104
So, my appetizer
for you this evening

22:00.104 --> 22:02.543
<i>is an uni custard</i>
<i>with poached prawns,</i>

22:02.543 --> 22:03.612
<i>little neck clams,</i>

22:03.612 --> 22:06.049
<i>and a Meyer lemon</i>
<i>miso vinaigrette.</i>

22:06.049 --> 22:09.757
This dish speaks of me
because I love to go
to the beach

22:09.757 --> 22:11.561
and I'm climbing
around the rocks,

22:11.561 --> 22:13.063
finding sea urchins,
finding clams,

22:13.063 --> 22:14.967
so it is me on a plate.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.905
This is what I would make.
This is what I would eat.

22:16.905 --> 22:18.575
Jason, visually,
it looks beautiful.

22:18.575 --> 22:20.913
‐ It's breathtaking.
‐ Thank you.

22:20.913 --> 22:24.820
The texture of that custard,
have you got that right?

22:24.820 --> 22:27.927
I think so, Chef.
I know that the ratio
of ingredients

22:27.927 --> 22:30.666
that I put in there
should produce the textures
that I wanted,

22:30.666 --> 22:31.634
and so I hope that it is.

22:31.634 --> 22:35.609
This custard, it should
be velvety, silk,

22:35.609 --> 22:37.646
almost like panna cotta.

22:37.646 --> 22:39.550
Smooth texture.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.821
Let's get in there.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.641
Jason...

22:51.641 --> 22:56.884
the bottom
of the custard is...

22:56.884 --> 22:58.888
( sighs )

23:04.600 --> 23:07.640
Jason...

23:07.640 --> 23:13.484
the bottom
of the custard is...

23:13.484 --> 23:15.555
( sighs )

23:15.555 --> 23:18.528
...it's broken.

23:18.528 --> 23:20.498
Now, that's to do
with the temperature gauge

23:20.498 --> 23:23.304
of how you added
that broth to the eggs.

23:23.304 --> 23:26.577
Now, it's not grainy,
but it's definitely separated.

23:26.577 --> 23:28.815
Understood.

23:34.660 --> 23:39.002
You know, young man,
the actual flavor
is incredible.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.572
‐ Thank you.
‐ The clams‐‐

23:40.572 --> 23:42.710
love that
sort of saltiness
from the sea.

23:42.710 --> 23:45.181
Unfortunately,
the texture's not there.

23:45.181 --> 23:46.684
Understood.

23:46.684 --> 23:49.022
Jason, I agree with Gordon.

23:49.022 --> 23:51.259
There are a few technical
difficulties with the custard.

23:51.259 --> 23:54.567
But... I think it's delicious.

23:54.567 --> 23:58.608
I think the spot prawn is
such a great textural piece.

23:58.608 --> 24:00.612
I think that the salmon roe
is a great textural piece.

24:00.612 --> 24:02.181
You had a few shortcomings
in this dish,

24:02.181 --> 24:04.987
but overall, I think it is
a really, really elegant,

24:04.987 --> 24:07.559
delicious start
to a three‐course meal.

24:07.559 --> 24:09.830
‐ Very impressive.
‐ Thank you.

24:09.830 --> 24:12.001
You have technical flaws
in the dish,

24:12.001 --> 24:15.542
your custard's broken,
but I like the dish.

24:15.542 --> 24:18.046
I think it's light
and flavorful.

24:18.046 --> 24:20.852
I think that the contrast
between the spot prawns

24:20.852 --> 24:22.756
and the cream,
it's done very well.

24:22.756 --> 24:25.862
So, I don't know.

24:25.862 --> 24:28.701
Jason, the actual flavor
of the custard, for me,
is sublime.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.206
I'm super surprised
that the amount of sea urchin

24:31.206 --> 24:33.611
that you put in there
didn't overtake the custard.

24:33.611 --> 24:36.049
I think it completely
mellowed out as it cooked.

24:36.049 --> 24:38.053
But I just think
the combination of all these

24:38.053 --> 24:41.226
beautiful fruits of the sea
gets really excessive.

24:41.226 --> 24:42.896
It just needs to be
improved upon.

24:42.896 --> 24:44.232
‐ Okay.
‐ Thank you.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.071
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

24:47.071 --> 24:49.108
It's okay, baby.

24:49.108 --> 24:51.614
Right, Eboni, please
present your appetizers.

24:51.614 --> 24:52.749
Thank you.

24:52.749 --> 24:54.419
Eboni:
<i>I want to show</i>
<i>the judges tonight</i>

24:54.419 --> 24:55.755
<i>that you can take</i>
<i>basic ingredients</i>

24:55.755 --> 24:57.425
that I can buy
at my local corner store

24:57.425 --> 25:00.632
<i>and I can turn 'em</i>
<i>into something that's</i>
<i>elevated and phenomenal</i>

25:00.632 --> 25:03.070
that could be served in
a Michelin star restaurant.

25:03.070 --> 25:04.607
Eboni, describe
the appetizer, please.

25:04.607 --> 25:06.577
I have a pan‐seared scallop

25:06.577 --> 25:10.117
<i>with charred Romanesco,</i>
<i>rainbow chard sauté,</i>

25:10.117 --> 25:11.954
<i>and a sweet garden pea puree.</i>

25:11.954 --> 25:15.795
‐ Visually,
it looks beautiful.
‐ Thank you.

25:15.795 --> 25:18.768
The scallops should be
slightly opaque in the center,

25:18.768 --> 25:22.809
so I'm just hoping that
they are cooked beautifully.

25:31.092 --> 25:33.998
Eboni...

25:33.998 --> 25:35.334
my scallops...

25:37.773 --> 25:39.142
are undercooked.

25:47.693 --> 25:50.197
You know,
your puree's delicious.

25:50.197 --> 25:53.203
Vibrant, sweet,
seasoned beautifully.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.374
The cauliflower, lovely.

25:55.374 --> 25:57.846
It's got that earthiness
and it tastes rustic.

25:57.846 --> 26:01.353
I just wish that
you'd kept those scallops
in that pan longer.

26:01.353 --> 26:02.956
It's a shame.

26:02.956 --> 26:06.262
Eboni, I think this is
really lovely dish.

26:06.262 --> 26:07.933
It's beautiful to look at.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.705
It's got a very nice,
gentle taste to it.

26:10.705 --> 26:13.811
That pea puree, it's rich
and it has a little sweetness.

26:13.811 --> 26:17.151
The cook on your scallops,
it's definitely
a hair undercooked,

26:17.151 --> 26:19.122
but you did a really
incredible job.

26:19.122 --> 26:20.659
Thank you, Chef.

26:20.659 --> 26:23.798
Had you cooked the scallops
with more heat,

26:23.798 --> 26:25.802
put it in the oven,
did whatever you had to do,

26:25.802 --> 26:27.806
you would have
had a perfect dish.

26:27.806 --> 26:31.312
But everything else
is spectacular.

26:31.312 --> 26:33.050
The flavors are complex,
interesting.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.755
I love English peas.
I love pea puree.

26:35.755 --> 26:37.726
It adds a lot of richness
and complexity to the dish.

26:37.726 --> 26:40.397
Roman broccoli,
perfectly seasoned.

26:40.397 --> 26:41.834
Good job.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.871
Eboni, I gotta say,
for me personally,

26:43.871 --> 26:47.411
my scallops are‐‐
they're just textbook.

26:47.411 --> 26:49.750
But for me, there's
a little departure

26:49.750 --> 26:51.887
from the accoutrements
that are with this dish.

26:51.887 --> 26:54.025
I would've loved
the Romanesco to have been cut

26:54.025 --> 26:56.396
the same size as the peas

26:56.396 --> 26:58.935
in that little sort of ragout
you have on the bottom.

26:58.935 --> 27:00.370
It would've achieved
a little bit

27:00.370 --> 27:01.774
more consistency in flavor.

27:01.774 --> 27:03.811
But that's a small detail.

27:03.811 --> 27:07.017
Eboni, it really impresses me
to see how far you've come.

27:07.017 --> 27:09.355
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chefs.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.833
( exhales )

27:14.833 --> 27:18.006
Right. Dino, please
present your appetizer.

27:18.006 --> 27:20.410
Dino:
<i>I am very proud of myself</i>
<i>and what I put on my plate.</i>

27:20.410 --> 27:23.216
The squid ink pasta turned out
exactly the way I wanted it to.

27:23.216 --> 27:25.187
The flavor's there,
just the right amount of ink,

27:25.187 --> 27:26.857
<i>just the right amount</i>
<i>of everything.</i>

27:26.857 --> 27:28.093
<i>It's perfect.</i>

27:28.093 --> 27:29.228
Describe
your appetizer, please.

27:29.228 --> 27:32.536
It is a squid ink
capellini pasta

27:32.536 --> 27:35.875
<i>with calamari, clams,</i>
<i>heirloom cherry tomatoes,</i>

27:35.875 --> 27:37.411
<i>and chorizo in there</i>
<i>for flavor.</i>

27:37.411 --> 27:39.883
Visually,
it looks beautiful.

27:39.883 --> 27:42.087
I love the black on white,
and the richness
of that olive oil.

27:42.087 --> 27:43.758
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Let's get in there.

27:48.968 --> 27:52.843
Now, this pasta should be
iron‐y and fragrant

27:52.843 --> 27:55.247
and dense and not gummy.

27:55.247 --> 27:56.449
How long did you cook it for?

27:56.449 --> 27:57.819
Three minutes in the water

27:57.819 --> 28:00.859
and about a minute thirty
in the sauce.

28:07.772 --> 28:10.879
Dino, uh...

28:10.879 --> 28:11.881
( exhales )

28:17.759 --> 28:21.232
Now, this pasta should be
iron‐y and fragrant

28:21.232 --> 28:23.403
and dense and not gummy.

28:26.242 --> 28:28.280
Dino...

28:28.280 --> 28:29.816
( sighs )

28:32.087 --> 28:33.925
I want to dive in for more.

28:35.929 --> 28:37.599
‐ It's delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

28:37.599 --> 28:38.701
The pasta's nice and wet.

28:38.701 --> 28:40.939
I think the balance between
the amount of squid ink

28:40.939 --> 28:42.007
is beautifully done.

28:42.007 --> 28:44.345
What would I want more?
More cooking the squid.

28:44.345 --> 28:47.451
I'd like to see
that sort of bound in
with the capellini,

28:47.451 --> 28:49.623
but it's‐‐
it's a great appetizer.

28:49.623 --> 28:52.896
This is a great start
to your three‐course meal.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.198
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

28:54.198 --> 28:56.302
I think it's
a beautiful dish.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.839
The pasta's the star.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.643
It's an even coat,
it's an even portion,

28:59.643 --> 29:00.912
and it's an even cook.

29:00.912 --> 29:02.481
And I like the chorizo.

29:02.481 --> 29:03.985
I think it sort of
makes it your own

29:03.985 --> 29:05.922
instead of playing
too much homage

29:05.922 --> 29:08.159
to something that maybe is
on the menu somewhere else.

29:08.159 --> 29:10.464
I think it's a beautiful,
beautiful dish.

29:10.464 --> 29:12.936
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Dino, I don't know you,

29:12.936 --> 29:15.942
but I've heard about
this guy from Bensonhurst

29:15.942 --> 29:17.277
who's a little bit eccentric,

29:17.277 --> 29:19.115
so I don't know
what to expect.

29:19.115 --> 29:21.887
And then I come here and you
serve me a dish of pasta

29:21.887 --> 29:26.129
that is exactly the same...

29:26.129 --> 29:27.231
as the best‐selling pasta

29:27.231 --> 29:29.970
at two of my restaurants
in New York City right now.

29:29.970 --> 29:32.041
I don't want to judge this guy.
I want to hire him.

29:32.041 --> 29:35.515
This dish is authentic,
flavorful, properly executed,

29:35.515 --> 29:37.552
a dish that I would be proud
and happy to sell,

29:37.552 --> 29:39.388
to make money on,
to sell at any of my restaurants

29:39.388 --> 29:40.925
and put my name behind.

29:40.925 --> 29:43.196
You're one hell of an excellent
Italian pasta cook.

29:43.196 --> 29:45.367
Thank you.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.041
I tasted this dish
and it just makes me smile.

29:49.041 --> 29:51.513
I think the balance
of the savory‐ness

29:51.513 --> 29:55.020
and the spiciness
of the chili is spot on.

29:55.020 --> 29:57.592
I like how developed
the flavor of the sauce is.

29:57.592 --> 30:00.397
It is really
a very heartfelt dish

30:00.397 --> 30:03.369
that I think says a lot
about your maturation
in this kitchen.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.543
Thank you. Thank you.

30:09.048 --> 30:13.423
Dino, Eboni, Jason,
please go back
into the kitchen

30:13.423 --> 30:15.962
and get organized
for your entrees.

30:15.962 --> 30:17.599
Let's go.

30:18.601 --> 30:22.909
( cheering )

30:26.415 --> 30:27.585
That was an amazing start.

30:27.585 --> 30:29.188
‐ So definitely a mixed bag.
‐ Yeah.

30:29.188 --> 30:32.261
Some things very interesting,
some things a little bit
lacking on execution.

30:32.261 --> 30:35.267
But all three
of these home cooks,

30:35.267 --> 30:36.670
certainly each
in their own right,

30:36.670 --> 30:38.273
‐ impressed us.
‐ For sure.

30:38.273 --> 30:41.012
Now, it's all
about the entrees.

30:44.485 --> 30:48.627
( cheering )

30:54.171 --> 30:56.810
Whoo! Woohoo! Whoo!

30:56.810 --> 30:59.315
What we've just witnessed
in there was extraordinary,

30:59.315 --> 31:02.755
but now it's about
those stunning entrees.

31:02.755 --> 31:05.126
‐ You three ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

31:05.126 --> 31:07.932
Your 60 minutes starts...

31:15.013 --> 31:16.516
...now.

31:16.516 --> 31:20.190
‐ Woman: Yes! Go, guys!
‐ ( crowd cheering )

31:20.190 --> 31:23.129
‐ Come on, let's go.
‐ Let's get it!

31:23.129 --> 31:27.037
60 minutes to make four
immaculate, stunning entrees.

31:27.037 --> 31:29.174
‐ It's still
any home cook's game.
‐ Yeah.

31:29.174 --> 31:31.379
‐ Come on, Mom!
‐ Go, Mom!

31:31.379 --> 31:35.086
For my entree,
I have a spiced honey‐glazed
duck breast

31:35.086 --> 31:37.491
<i>with sautéed collard greens,</i>
<i>a sweet potato puree,</i>

31:37.491 --> 31:40.397
<i>a carrot top vinaigrette</i>
<i>with crispy duck skin.</i>

31:40.397 --> 31:42.034
<i>Coming out</i>
<i>of the appetizer round,</i>

31:42.034 --> 31:44.204
it's definitely a full‐on war.

31:44.204 --> 31:46.510
<i>I got to bring it</i>
<i>in the entree round.</i>

31:46.510 --> 31:48.681
I gotta bring them
down home Chicago

31:48.681 --> 31:51.419
<i>south side flavors</i>
<i>and just deliver.</i>

31:51.419 --> 31:54.559
All right, Jason.
All right, Jason.

31:54.559 --> 31:58.767
For my entree, I'm presenting
a tofu skin wrapped black cod

31:58.767 --> 32:01.105
<i>with my maitake mushrooms</i>
<i>and Nantucket Bay scallops</i>

32:01.105 --> 32:04.144
<i>with a pea tendril</i>
<i>cucumber sauce.</i>

32:04.144 --> 32:06.482
<i>I have to figure a way</i>
<i>to harness what I've learned</i>

32:06.482 --> 32:08.821
from the mistakes
in the appetizer round

32:08.821 --> 32:11.492
<i>and take that experience,</i>
<i>take that criticism,</i>

32:11.492 --> 32:15.568
and really channel it
into something that I hope
the judges love.

32:15.568 --> 32:19.074
Whoo! Go, Dino!

32:19.074 --> 32:21.178
For my entree,
I'm making a rack of lamb

32:21.178 --> 32:24.218
<i>on a lamb belly</i>
<i>and sunchoke caponata</i>

32:24.218 --> 32:29.194
<i>with pea tendrils</i>
<i>and a fig and cipollini</i>
<i>balsamic glaze.</i>

32:29.194 --> 32:32.869
<i>For my lamb belly,</i>
<i>I'm using a pressure cooker</i>
<i>to soften that lamb belly.</i>

32:32.869 --> 32:36.242
<i>When it comes out,</i>
<i>if it's not exactly perfect,</i>

32:36.242 --> 32:37.745
<i>tender,</i>
<i>the way it needs to be,</i>

32:37.745 --> 32:39.081
I'm completely screwed.

32:39.081 --> 32:40.584
Ow!

32:40.584 --> 32:43.055
47 minutes remaining.
Let's go!

32:45.728 --> 32:47.732
Come on, guys!

32:55.246 --> 32:57.250
‐ Let's go!
‐ ( cheering )

33:02.194 --> 33:04.064
All right, Miss Eboni,
how are you looking?

33:04.064 --> 33:05.233
I'm feeling good, Chef.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.237
‐ You're gonna mash those?
‐ Yep.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.274
And those are collard greens?
What do you have in there?

33:09.274 --> 33:12.715
I got some pancetta in here,
some garlic, some shallots.

33:12.715 --> 33:13.717
Then I'm gonna put down
on it a little bit

33:13.717 --> 33:17.224
of champagne vinegar
because it gives it a kick.

33:17.224 --> 33:20.263
Now, why cook duck tonight?
That's what I'm curious about.

33:20.263 --> 33:21.465
Well, because
I make duck at home.

33:21.465 --> 33:24.639
I had to stick to what's true
to me and what I like making,

33:24.639 --> 33:25.975
so I make duck at home
for my family.

33:25.975 --> 33:28.412
And how much time
are you giving yourself
to cook that duck?

33:28.412 --> 33:30.149
It needs about
10 minutes to rest,

33:30.149 --> 33:32.622
so when we get to,
like, 35 minutes,
I'm gonna cook my duck.

33:32.622 --> 33:35.293
‐ Okay, got you.
‐ You're gonna sear them
in a nonstick pan?

33:35.293 --> 33:36.495
No, I'm doing it
in cast iron.

33:36.495 --> 33:37.765
Cast iron.
And then you're gonna
put 'em in the oven?

33:37.765 --> 33:39.134
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

33:39.134 --> 33:41.472
And what do you want
the interior of the duck
temperature to be like?

33:41.472 --> 33:43.476
‐ Medium rare.
‐ Eboni, good luck.

33:43.476 --> 33:45.614
( crowd cheering )

33:45.614 --> 33:47.685
Yay!

33:49.656 --> 33:51.458
Gordon:
Guys, just over halfway.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.830
28 minutes remaining.
Come on, guys.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.466
‐ Christina: Come on.
‐ Come on!

33:55.466 --> 33:56.736
Come on, Jason!

33:59.642 --> 34:02.247
Right, young man,
how are you feeling?

34:02.247 --> 34:03.115
‐ I'm feeling very well.
‐ You good?

34:03.115 --> 34:04.652
I got a better control
of my jitters

34:04.652 --> 34:05.921
‐ from the appetizer round,
‐ Good.

34:05.921 --> 34:07.157
so I think I'm gonna
be in better shape.

34:07.157 --> 34:09.629
Listen, this is a competition
across three courses, okay?

34:09.629 --> 34:10.798
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Tell me about this dish

34:10.798 --> 34:11.800
because it sounds incredible.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.269
This dish
is really an homage

34:13.269 --> 34:15.440
to some of my Asian flavors

34:15.440 --> 34:18.212
and my parents
coming from Taiwan.

34:19.314 --> 34:20.818
The idea of wrapping
this in tofu skin,

34:20.818 --> 34:22.287
what's the purpose
behind this?

34:22.287 --> 34:24.692
I thought it would make
a wonderful trapping

34:24.692 --> 34:27.632
for the steamed juices
of the fish on the inside,

34:27.632 --> 34:28.667
‐ and that way, as it sits,
‐ Right.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.537
all the juices gets absorbed
by the tofu skin.

34:30.537 --> 34:33.209
And that tofu skin
will render down in such a way

34:33.209 --> 34:35.213
that it's gonna give
some texture,

34:35.213 --> 34:36.482
it's gonna give some crunch,
is that correct?

34:36.482 --> 34:38.887
Yes, when it's first cooked,
it's gonna be nice and crispy,

34:38.887 --> 34:40.891
then as it sits,
it's gonna absorb
some of that sauce

34:40.891 --> 34:42.494
and give you
a more chewy texture.

34:42.494 --> 34:43.830
So it's a play
on textures as well.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.366
Gordon:
Why can't you keep it simple?

34:45.366 --> 34:47.203
I think this is
simple for me, Chef.

34:47.203 --> 34:49.374
( laughter )

34:49.374 --> 34:50.844
You're the only one
in the room that thinks
this is simple, okay?

34:50.844 --> 34:52.848
‐ Okay.
‐ Good luck.

34:52.848 --> 34:54.585
All right, Jason.
All right, Jason.

34:55.888 --> 34:58.392
‐ Dino!
‐ How you doing, Chef?

34:58.392 --> 35:00.898
Now are you serving us
this lamb chop whole?
Are you carving it at all?

35:00.898 --> 35:03.202
I'm giving it to you whole.
Hopefully you'll see
a medium rare in there.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.706
And how are you gonna make
caponata in an hour?

35:04.706 --> 35:06.475
‐ Um...
‐ Where is it?

35:06.475 --> 35:07.712
I'm gonna pray.
It's right here.

35:07.712 --> 35:09.549
I'm still working on it.
I got the sauce in here,

35:09.549 --> 35:11.553
I got a couple elements
right here.

35:11.553 --> 35:13.189
What‐‐ you have olives
in there? Eggplants?
What's the basis of it?

35:13.189 --> 35:14.859
I got capers,
I got the juice

35:14.859 --> 35:15.861
from the artichokes,
the sunchokes,

35:15.861 --> 35:19.234
I got oregano, I got raisins,

35:19.234 --> 35:20.336
and I'm putting
pine nuts in there.

35:20.336 --> 35:22.541
I'm worried that this dish
is gonna be too sweet.

35:22.541 --> 35:24.712
Are you monitoring the sugar
you're putting on here?

35:24.712 --> 35:26.381
Oh, yeah.
I didn't add sugar to this,

35:26.381 --> 35:27.183
but this thing right here,

35:27.183 --> 35:28.385
you're gonna get
the juice from that.

35:28.385 --> 35:30.223
It's not gonna be too sugary.

35:30.223 --> 35:31.726
And when does
that lamb belly come out of
that pressure cooker?

35:31.726 --> 35:33.597
It's coming out‐‐ one minute.

35:33.597 --> 35:35.433
If you open
that pressure cooker

35:35.433 --> 35:38.272
and that lamb belly
is not just falling apart,

35:38.272 --> 35:41.245
tenderized, and beautiful,
you could be in trouble.

35:41.245 --> 35:43.282
Oh, it'll fall apart,
because it's a lot thinner
than a pork belly.

35:43.282 --> 35:44.886
You ready to open up
this pressure cooker?

35:44.886 --> 35:46.723
‐ I am.
‐ Let's do it.

35:52.735 --> 35:53.937
‐ Watch out, babies.
‐ Here we go.

35:53.937 --> 35:56.408
I can't watch.

35:56.408 --> 35:58.245
All right.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.391
‐ Dino.
‐ Chef?

36:04.391 --> 36:06.195
You have a huge issue
with this dish.

36:13.375 --> 36:14.879
If you open
that pressure cooker

36:14.879 --> 36:18.052
and that lamb belly
is not tenderized
and beautiful,

36:18.052 --> 36:19.555
‐ you could be in trouble.
‐ Let's do it.

36:21.258 --> 36:24.297
‐ Watch out, babies.
‐ Here we go.

36:25.299 --> 36:29.074
‐ Dino.
‐ Chef?

36:29.074 --> 36:31.278
You have a huge issue
with this dish.

36:34.819 --> 36:37.791
You need
to cook this right away
and more and fast.

36:37.791 --> 36:39.427
Right now
I'm actually sweating.

36:39.427 --> 36:41.431
<i>The lamb</i>
<i>is very undercooked.</i>

36:41.431 --> 36:42.433
I'm throwing it
in the deep fryer, though.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.304
Right here.
This'll do it.

36:44.304 --> 36:46.475
‐ It's all on you.
‐ All right. I got time.

36:46.475 --> 36:49.347
<i>I gotta make sure that lamb</i>
<i>is perfectly cooked.</i>

36:49.347 --> 36:51.118
<i>I have to stick it</i>
<i>in the deep fryer</i>

36:51.118 --> 36:52.487
<i>and get it extra crispy.</i>

36:52.487 --> 36:53.957
I'm putting it
in the fryer right now.

36:53.957 --> 36:55.627
<i>That lamb belly</i>
<i>needs to be perfect.</i>

36:55.627 --> 36:57.497
Not only am I counting
on myself to make it perfect,

36:57.497 --> 36:58.867
<i>but a lot of people</i>
<i>are counting on me, too.</i>

36:58.867 --> 37:00.704
‐ All right, Dino!
‐ Keep on it.

37:00.704 --> 37:02.307
Yeah.

37:05.446 --> 37:07.785
Go, Dino. Real nice crisp.
Real nice crisp on that.

37:07.785 --> 37:09.655
‐ You got this.
‐ Focus, focus.

37:09.655 --> 37:11.960
Gordon:
12 minutes remaining.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.364
All right, guys,
so, Dino‐‐

37:14.364 --> 37:16.836
the one thing I have
to say about Dino that I'm
incredibly worried about

37:16.836 --> 37:18.640
is the cook
on his lamb belly.

37:18.640 --> 37:23.015
If he gives us a tough,
unflattering piece
of lamb belly

37:23.015 --> 37:24.852
underneath a beautiful
lamb of loin, for me,

37:24.852 --> 37:26.956
I don't care how well cooked
that lamb of loin is,

37:26.956 --> 37:29.394
you're serving it
with an untenderized
lamb belly

37:29.394 --> 37:31.031
that hasn't spent enough time
in the pressure cooker,

37:31.031 --> 37:34.037
and that entree's
gonna be a mess.

37:34.037 --> 37:35.874
Way to go, Dino.

37:35.874 --> 37:39.047
Jason's sounds incredibly
chef‐y again.

37:39.047 --> 37:41.986
This guy's technique‐‐
have you ever heard
of a tofu skin wrapped cod?

37:41.986 --> 37:43.155
‐ Never.
‐ Joe?

37:43.155 --> 37:45.527
‐ No.
‐ Come on, Jason.

37:45.527 --> 37:47.497
This is one
of the strangest dishes

37:47.497 --> 37:50.002
I've ever seen in
the history of "MasterChef."

37:50.002 --> 37:51.539
Come on, Eb,
stay focused.

37:51.539 --> 37:53.375
Gordon:
Eboni is doing
this incredible

37:53.375 --> 37:55.680
spiced honey glazed
duck breast.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.718
This could be
an incredible showstopper.

37:57.718 --> 38:00.524
Get that duck caramelized,
get that skin crispy,

38:00.524 --> 38:02.460
and that pinkness
with that fat rendered down.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.632
Yeah, but the question is,
is this dish too simplistic?

38:04.632 --> 38:06.368
Is it elevated enough?

38:06.368 --> 38:08.506
Is the presentation
gonna be such that
it takes away

38:08.506 --> 38:11.512
from that home‐style
element that this dish
already possesses,

38:11.512 --> 38:14.350
and are you gonna have
enough time to cook those
collard greens properly?

38:14.350 --> 38:16.388
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ Come on.

38:16.388 --> 38:18.058
‐ Gordon: Come on.
‐ You got it this.

38:18.058 --> 38:19.394
You got it. You got it.
Stay focused.

38:19.394 --> 38:20.864
Come on, Mom!

38:22.366 --> 38:25.674
We are down to
seven minutes to go, guys.

38:30.015 --> 38:31.586
You've got
to start plating.

38:31.586 --> 38:33.690
That lamb looks
beautiful, Dino.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.392
Great sear,
a great color.

38:35.392 --> 38:38.465
Yeah, baby doll.
All right! Ow!

38:38.465 --> 38:40.035
‐ Plating.
‐ Start plating.

You've got to speed up.

‐ Ooh, baby.

38:46.716 --> 38:48.118

38:52.226 --> 38:54.430
Yachecia:
Stay focused, Jason.
Watch your time, baby.

38:54.430 --> 38:57.905
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are coming down to five
minutes remaining.

38:57.905 --> 38:59.909
Jason:
<i>There are five minutes left</i>
<i>in the clock</i>

38:59.909 --> 39:03.516
and I still have to plate
my scallops, my mushrooms,

39:03.516 --> 39:05.386
<i>my fish is just</i>
<i>coming out of the pan,</i>

39:05.386 --> 39:07.023
<i>I have to fry</i>
<i>the rice noodles,</i>

39:07.023 --> 39:09.695
<i>I have to get</i>
<i>the mitsuba garnish</i>
<i>and the cilantro flowers</i>

39:09.695 --> 39:11.699
and the cucumber flowers,
and sauce the plate.

39:11.699 --> 39:14.204
Jason, you have to start
plating, young man.

39:14.204 --> 39:16.041
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ <i>Of all the times in my life</i>

39:16.041 --> 39:19.214
to fall behind on my scheduling,
this is not the time to do it.

39:19.214 --> 39:22.053
Everyone's plating
except for Jason.

39:22.053 --> 39:24.457
Eva:
Get it on the plate.
Don't be fussy.

39:24.457 --> 39:26.428
Two minutes,
two minutes.

39:26.428 --> 39:28.600
Two minutes remaining.
Come on.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.904
Christina:
Come on, guys.

39:30.904 --> 39:32.574
You're killing me.

39:32.574 --> 39:34.778
Oh, Jesus, have mercy.

39:34.778 --> 39:36.481

39:36.481 --> 39:38.252
‐ Yachecia: Come on.
‐ Cate: Let's go.
Yeah, move it.

39:38.252 --> 39:39.755
Let's go!
Get your plates out!

39:39.755 --> 39:42.594
‐ Come on.
‐ Jason, keep moving.

39:42.594 --> 39:44.264
Jason doesn't even
have plates out.

39:44.264 --> 39:45.499
Are you kidding me?

39:45.499 --> 39:46.769
‐ Come on, Jason.
‐ Plate, Jason.

39:46.769 --> 39:49.942

‐ Oh, my God.

39:49.942 --> 39:51.545
‐ Cate: Come on.
‐ Gotta hustle now.

39:51.545 --> 39:54.117
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, plate.</i>

39:54.117 --> 39:56.154
<i>I don't know how</i>

39:56.154 --> 39:57.624
<i>with under two minutes to go</i>

39:57.624 --> 39:58.793

have plates out.

Come on, Jason!

39:59.662 --> 40:03.703
Jason, you've got
to start plating.

40:03.703 --> 40:06.207
Oh, my God.
He's panicking now.

40:06.207 --> 40:07.644
Let's go!

40:07.644 --> 40:08.846
He's got to finish,
and he's got to get

40:08.846 --> 40:10.717
everything on
the plate exactly,

40:10.717 --> 40:12.219
or Jason's done!

40:12.219 --> 40:15.025
Joe:
Guys, Jason is way,
way, way behind.

40:15.025 --> 40:17.564
He might not be able to
get everything on the plate.

40:17.564 --> 40:20.069
