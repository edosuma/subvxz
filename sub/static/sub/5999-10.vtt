00:00.301 --> 00:01.251
Charlie: <i>Previously on "Manhattan"... </i>

00:01.302 --> 00:03.253
Because on July 4th, 1945,

00:03.988 --> 00:06.907
we're going to test the
gadget in our own backyard.

00:06.908 --> 00:09.910
Frank: <i>The Army manipulated
us, you and I, Charlie.</i>

00:10.361 --> 00:11.693
<i>We have to stop this train.</i>

00:11.729 --> 00:13.196
He doesn't just want a seat at the table.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.815
He wants to shut down the project.

00:15.866 --> 00:18.568
If you thought you were racing
the Nazis to a super weapon,

00:18.619 --> 00:20.820
<i>your ignorance has been engineered.</i>

00:20.871 --> 00:22.906
I gave up my one shot at history

00:22.957 --> 00:24.457
so you could get us a seat at the table.

00:24.491 --> 00:28.077
You excited to incinerate 20,000 kids?

00:28.128 --> 00:31.130
I think Frank Winter sabotaged the pretest.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.833
This test is the start of a whole new era,

00:33.884 --> 00:37.720
like Auro's interplanetary cruise
ship crash-landing on Jupiter.

00:37.755 --> 00:40.556
- Are you a spy, Jim?
- Uh, Jeannie, wait!

00:40.591 --> 00:42.225
Jim! I'll handle this.

00:43.894 --> 00:45.728
I'm not going to Trinity.

00:45.763 --> 00:47.146
I'm grateful for the opportunities

00:47.181 --> 00:48.731
you've given me here, Charlie,

00:48.766 --> 00:51.901
but I've had enough death for one lifetime.

00:51.936 --> 00:54.687
- Where's Joey?
- He's on his way to Brooklyn.

00:54.738 --> 00:58.441
<i>Juanita's driving him. He's
going to live with my parents.</i>

00:58.492 --> 01:00.193
Keeping him safe from you,

01:00.244 --> 01:01.861
just like you should have been
kept safe from your father!

01:01.912 --> 01:03.863
You think I won't get in
the car and bring him back?

01:03.914 --> 01:06.582
Your test is in 24 hours.

01:06.617 --> 01:08.584
You think I don't know
which way you'll drive?

01:08.619 --> 01:12.372
You, a guy who went to
a second-rate law school,

01:12.423 --> 01:16.042
is getting orchestra
seats to physics history?

01:16.093 --> 01:17.760
Nora: <i>You and Perseus</i>

01:17.795 --> 01:19.379
<i>are going to go out there on your own.</i>

01:19.430 --> 01:21.180
You built the circuits.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.716
You can wire them to go
off at any time you like.

01:23.767 --> 01:27.136
Meeks: <i>You want to kill the scientists.</i>

01:27.187 --> 01:29.973
<i>You want to kill my friends.</i>

01:30.024 --> 01:32.442
Paul?

01:32.476 --> 01:34.227
We need to talk about Jim.

01:41.285 --> 01:42.785
Stan: Last car leaves the blast zone

01:42.820 --> 01:45.405
at zero minus 30 minutes.

01:45.456 --> 01:47.156
They test the firing switch...

01:47.207 --> 01:50.543
Meeks: Two hours earlier. I know.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.412
Stan: So you rig the detonator

01:52.463 --> 01:54.213
to go off when Isaacs hits the switch.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.417
The bomb fizzles and scatters plutonium

01:57.468 --> 01:59.802
<i>halfway to El Paso.</i>

01:59.837 --> 02:01.971
Killing all the staff on the ground.

02:04.475 --> 02:07.810
I think we should stick
to the original plan.

02:07.845 --> 02:10.229
Hold off till everyone evacuates.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.815
Just... just you and me now, right?

02:12.850 --> 02:15.818
The decision is ours.

02:15.853 --> 02:19.022
We're not the directors of this play.

02:19.073 --> 02:22.575
- We're the actors.
- What's your part?

02:22.609 --> 02:24.444
Make sure I do mine?

02:29.416 --> 02:30.917
Frank: <i>But where's the proof, Paul,</i>

02:30.951 --> 02:33.252
besides some baseball hat?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.588
Meeks was the most
devoted member of my group.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.256
I practically had to
crowbar him out the door

02:37.291 --> 02:39.509
to attend his own mother's funeral.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.296
What?

02:51.021 --> 02:52.688

Yes, hello.

Who am I speaking with?

03:19.383 --> 03:21.918
<i>This is Edith Meeks.</i>

03:24.755 --> 03:27.140
Frank: <i>I'm very sorry
to trouble you, ma'am.</i>

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
Is Jim Meeks your son?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.845
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

03:32.896 --> 03:35.314
<i>Are you a friend of Jimmy's?</i>

03:35.349 --> 03:38.985
No, I... I was his teacher.

03:40.938 --> 03:43.022
He's going to wind up
in the electric chair.

03:43.073 --> 03:44.824
God, Frank, Colonel Darrow finds out,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.527
he won't make it that far, believe me.

03:47.578 --> 03:49.495
- Who else knows?
- No one.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.664
And as soon as it's out of
the bag, he's beyond our help.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.033
A spy in the hand is worth 10 in the grave.

03:54.084 --> 03:56.335
We can flip him double agency.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.121
The Soviets have been doing it for decades.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.922
We've just joined the game.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.541
We?

04:01.592 --> 04:04.377
I may have picked up some extracurriculars.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.049
Listen to me, all right?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.135
Intelligence boys will
play poker with a spy,

04:12.186 --> 04:13.352
but not with a saboteur,

04:13.387 --> 04:15.221
so we have one chance to save him.

04:15.272 --> 04:18.107
We'll get to Jim before
he gets to the bomb.

04:18.142 --> 04:19.809
Man: <i>We're looking for Dr. Frank Winter.</i>

04:19.860 --> 04:21.810
Man 2: <i>Is this his desk?</i>

04:21.862 --> 04:23.396
Man: <i>Where's Frank Winter?</i>

04:23.447 --> 04:25.364
Damn it. Helen.

04:25.399 --> 04:29.202
I may have dabbled in some
extracurriculars myself.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.987
Crosley: Why did you
think I came to you first?

04:36.627 --> 04:39.295
They're my friends, the scientists.

04:39.329 --> 04:41.080
Stan: Well, they're also mass murderers.

04:41.131 --> 04:42.965
You can do better.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.718
Where the hell is my Trinity pass?

04:45.752 --> 04:47.587
- Will you pull over?
- What?

04:47.638 --> 04:49.088
Pull over?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.016
The goddamn pass has got to be in here.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.158
<i>The pass has got to be back here somewhere.</i>

Hey! Wait!

05:51.702 --> 05:53.819
Charlie! Just wait, please!

05:53.870 --> 05:57.423
So, the dawn, the dawn of the atomic age

05:57.457 --> 06:00.243
being ushered in by a Jewish cardsharp

06:00.294 --> 06:02.245
whose family crash-landed
on the American shore...

06:02.296 --> 06:04.080
- You shouldn't be down here.
- Less than 50 years ago.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.298
No, just one quote. One quote.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.334
<i>(Chatter on P.A.)</i>

Liza.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.513
Fritz, you're here.

06:20.515 --> 06:24.483
You were right. Work helps.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.436
So does beer and crying,

06:27.487 --> 06:28.988
but...

06:30.524 --> 06:32.658
Jeannie would have wanted me to be here.

06:35.779 --> 06:37.997
I warned them about the storm.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.917
They don't care.

06:41.952 --> 06:44.370
They won't even let me in the command tent.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.876
But they'll let you in, right?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.796
What do I tell them?

06:54.815 --> 06:57.133
(Grunts)

06:57.184 --> 06:59.986
Whoa! Charlie! Charlie!

07:00.020 --> 07:02.271
Fritz! You're here.

07:02.306 --> 07:03.472
Yeah.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.142
I'm glad. Grab a radio.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.394
Make sure the circuit cables
don't short out in the rain.

07:08.396 --> 07:09.895
Whoa, whoa, we're supposed to meet

07:09.897 --> 07:11.897
10 weather conditions
before we pull the trigger.

07:11.899 --> 07:15.151
Visibility over 45 miles,
humidity below 85%...

07:15.202 --> 07:16.786
Yeah, I read the report.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.572
But you got to talk to the
Colonel, delay the test.

07:19.574 --> 07:22.992
The Colonel and I aren't
on the best of terms.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.578
- (Men chattering)
- Man: Ready to go.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.630
Look, at any given moment

07:27.664 --> 07:30.166
there are 3,000 thunderstorms
somewhere on the planet.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.801
No, no. This one is special.

07:31.835 --> 07:35.087
Gulf air at 17,000 feet,
two inversion layers...

07:35.089 --> 07:38.057
They're not going to
call the game for rain.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.975
Let's just hope it blows over.

07:40.010 --> 07:43.312
It'll blow radioactive fallout
from Roswell to Socorro.

07:43.347 --> 07:44.814
I'm sympathetic. The Army isn't.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.849
Either way, I take responsibility.

07:50.854 --> 07:53.522
Hey. Where you been?

07:53.573 --> 07:54.857
You all right, pal?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.609
Yeah, I got a...

07:56.611 --> 07:58.911
I got a flat tire on the way up.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.162
Oh.

08:00.197 --> 08:01.497
I'm supposed to check the...

08:01.531 --> 08:03.165
The detonator circuits.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.284
I think they already took care of it.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.038
So it's, it's happening?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.507
Right now?

08:11.541 --> 08:14.543
In the face of reason
and safety precautions.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.796
Welcome to Jupiter.

You want a volunteer to climb
a 100-foot steel lightning rod?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.082
- Yes.
- To babysit Shiva, the god of death,

08:53.133 --> 08:54.834
in the middle of an electrical storm.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.253
Pellegrin: Well, maybe the
Japs can spare a kamikaze pilot.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.805

- I, I don't have a man to spare.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.174
- Charlie: You don't have a man to spare?
- What is it that you want?

09:02.176 --> 09:04.894
<i>This is a war. I don't care about one guy!</i>

09:04.928 --> 09:08.063
- Right.
- I'll do it.

09:08.098 --> 09:09.648
No way.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.983
If the Colonel wants to
double-check the detonators,

09:11.017 --> 09:12.518
<i>he can do it himself.</i>

09:12.520 --> 09:14.153
We're concerned about the
possibility of sabotage.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.905
It's just a precaution.

09:15.939 --> 09:18.324
No wife, no kids. I'll do it.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.360
- I'll do it.
- No, you're more valuable on the ground.

09:21.362 --> 09:24.246
Jim, you don't have to.

09:24.281 --> 09:25.581
It's okay.

09:25.615 --> 09:27.700
It should be someone you trust.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.375
to the 10,000-meter perimeter.

10:11.211 --> 10:15.080
And if anyone sees Dr.
Frank Winter on the premises,

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
arrest him.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.168
If he resists,

14:02.872 --> 14:04.338
<i>Joey's not here, Charlie.</i>

14:04.372 --> 14:06.006
You're bluffing the wrong guy.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.510
She didn't give me a chance
to say good-bye to him.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.512
Your daughter tell you that?

14:11.546 --> 14:14.849
<i>- Charlie, is something wrong?
- (rustling)</i>

14:14.883 --> 14:16.767
Maxwell: <i>I think you better
sleep it off, Chaz.</i>

14:16.801 --> 14:18.552
So help me God.

14:18.554 --> 14:19.770
When it's done,

14:19.804 --> 14:23.357
I'm coming east in a goddamn B-29.

14:23.391 --> 14:25.192
And when I...

14:26.561 --> 14:29.196
Max, just...

14:30.565 --> 14:33.784
tell Joey that I

14:33.818 --> 14:35.819
can you tell Joey I love him?

14:37.038 --> 14:38.706
Can you do that?

14:42.210 --> 14:43.911
Max?

15:28.089 --> 15:29.590
- Jim?
- Ah!

15:29.624 --> 15:32.376
- (Objects clatter)
- Frank?

15:32.427 --> 15:33.711
<i>Frank.</i>

15:33.762 --> 15:35.129
<i>You're not... </i>

15:35.131 --> 15:36.847
You're not supposed to be up here.

15:36.881 --> 15:38.432
What are...

15:38.466 --> 15:40.768
I'd feel better if you pointed that thing

15:40.802 --> 15:42.803
away from the atomic bomb.

15:46.808 --> 15:49.360
I called the house in Bangor, Jim.

15:49.394 --> 15:50.978
I talked to your mother.

15:57.118 --> 15:59.236
Why did you call my mother?

15:59.287 --> 16:00.821
Well, if you have a hypothesis,

16:00.823 --> 16:02.656
you check your assumptions, right?

16:04.826 --> 16:07.411
I don't want to hurt anybody.

16:08.964 --> 16:10.297
Well, you picked the wrong line of work.

16:10.332 --> 16:11.966
But I will.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.251
Jim, I'm not here to stop you.

16:14.302 --> 16:16.887
- I'm here to help you.
- <i>(rocket whistles)</i>

16:16.921 --> 16:19.673
Man on P.A.: <i>Zero minus 90 minutes.</i>

16:19.675 --> 16:22.810
- It's the 90-minute rocket.
- Who knows you're here?

16:22.844 --> 16:24.678
Do you really think
they'd be running the clock

16:24.680 --> 16:26.680
if anyone knew I was
standing up in this room?

16:26.682 --> 16:30.317
- What do you want, Frank?
- The same as you.

16:30.352 --> 16:31.685
I've been trying to put this thing

16:31.687 --> 16:33.487
back in the box for over a year.

16:33.521 --> 16:35.489
You remember the petition?

16:35.523 --> 16:39.109
The faked intelligence on the German bomb?

16:39.160 --> 16:40.694
I'm the one that blew the whistle.

16:42.163 --> 16:44.331
That was... that was different.

16:44.366 --> 16:45.916
I sabotaged the pretest.

16:45.950 --> 16:47.868
The pretest? The pretest was a fluke.

16:47.870 --> 16:50.537
- One of the detonators...
- Was mislabeled.

16:51.956 --> 16:54.341
Strand three, cap six.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.545
Jesus.

17:06.186 --> 17:10.186
You remember what you
said to me the day we met?

17:10.392 --> 17:14.392
You wanted to switch
majors, to medicine, right?

17:15.896 --> 17:19.366
Because you thought physics
was just too abstract.

17:19.401 --> 17:23.401
<i>You were going to leave the
world better than you found it.</i>

17:23.704 --> 17:25.239
That's what I'm doing.

17:27.742 --> 17:31.295
Well, I can help.

17:31.329 --> 17:33.080
<i>It's already done.</i>

17:34.749 --> 17:36.583
You sure you don't want a second opinion?

17:36.585 --> 17:39.086
You climbed a hundred-foot
tower to check my work?

17:40.588 --> 17:42.506
My guess is you, uh...

17:42.557 --> 17:45.175
You rewired the firing system, right?

17:45.226 --> 17:47.978
You botch the timing, you get a big bang,

17:48.012 --> 17:49.346
but no chain reaction.

17:49.397 --> 17:52.516
The plutonium scattered, gone.

17:54.602 --> 17:56.770
That's certainly how I would have done it.

17:57.939 --> 18:00.190
You reattach the trigger line?

18:00.241 --> 18:01.775
Of course.

18:01.777 --> 18:03.777
And you used silver wire,
not tungsten or Nichrome?

18:03.779 --> 18:06.780
I took Intro to Thermal
Physics... from you.

18:09.033 --> 18:11.952
And you grounded the capacitor bank, yes?

18:13.955 --> 18:15.255
<i>Because if you didn't,</i>

18:15.290 --> 18:19.209
a red light goes off in Charlie's tent

18:19.260 --> 18:21.295
and up come the geniuses.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.798
Well, uh, there's no...
There's no grounding strap.

18:31.806 --> 18:35.392
We're sitting on top of
100 feet of steel, Jim.

18:35.443 --> 18:38.228
It's frontier medicine.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.063
You learn to work with what you've got.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.817
Will you toss me a wrench?

18:45.320 --> 18:46.487
Shit.

18:55.606 --> 18:56.606
<i>Thanks.</i>

19:00.704 --> 19:03.504
Somehow this thing looked better on paper.

19:06.317 --> 19:08.485
<i>(Crickets chirping)</i>

19:08.487 --> 19:11.321

19:33.811 --> 19:35.011
What time is it?

19:35.013 --> 19:36.429
There's a call at the switchboard.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.349
Your husband wants to speak with you.

19:39.351 --> 19:43.351
Well, tell him that I will
speak with him in the morning...

19:44.022 --> 19:46.356
if there is one.

19:46.358 --> 19:48.608
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good night.

19:56.784 --> 20:00.036
<i>(Car door opens, closes)</i>

20:27.565 --> 20:30.650
<i>(thunder crashes)</i>

20:37.875 --> 20:41.828
So how'd they sell you, the Russians?

20:41.879 --> 20:44.831
Nobody sold me anything.

20:44.882 --> 20:47.217
It was too big for one country to sit on,

20:47.251 --> 20:49.052
even the good guys.

20:50.421 --> 20:52.255
Is that what we are?

20:52.257 --> 20:56.009
You hear what Charlie
told the Target Committee?

20:56.060 --> 21:00.060
He said we should drop it
on a city full of civilians,

21:00.264 --> 21:03.850
maximize collateral damage.

21:03.901 --> 21:06.653
<i>Someone has to stand up,</i>

21:06.687 --> 21:10.440
save the world from the guys
who are saving the world.

21:13.444 --> 21:16.446
<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

21:20.951 --> 21:21.951

21:24.088 --> 21:26.206
Meeks: <i>Hi, Charlie. Uh... </i>

21:26.257 --> 21:28.625
Charlie: <i>How are you doing up there?</i>

21:28.627 --> 21:32.545
Meeks: <i>I was just, uh,
rechecking the firing system.</i>

21:57.321 --> 21:59.289
Dr. Oppenheimer.

21:59.323 --> 22:01.908
I wasn't supposed to be here, I know,

22:01.959 --> 22:04.244
but as a member of the
original implosion team,

22:04.295 --> 22:06.079
I thought...

22:06.130 --> 22:07.497
We call it Little Boy,

22:07.499 --> 22:10.083
but it's not a boy at all, is it?

22:10.134 --> 22:11.918
"Profligate, but ultimately dependable."

22:11.969 --> 22:14.721
<i>That describes every woman I know.</i>

22:14.755 --> 22:16.256
Sir?

22:16.307 --> 22:18.308
The components for the uranium bomb

22:18.342 --> 22:20.677
have been loaded onto the USS Indianapolis.

22:22.096 --> 22:24.514
We're going to use Little Boy?

22:24.516 --> 22:26.099
Without even testing it?

22:26.150 --> 22:27.850
<i>We know it will work,</i>

22:27.852 --> 22:30.520
which is more than I can say for...

22:33.274 --> 22:35.024
For reasons of which you are well aware,

22:35.026 --> 22:37.026
Frank Winter has been relieved of his post.

22:40.364 --> 22:42.365
You're the new head of the group.

Thank you, s...

22:49.173 --> 22:51.541
Sir, I, uh...

22:51.543 --> 22:53.343
I'll return to the Hill
the second the test is over.

22:53.377 --> 22:55.962
No, you're leaving for Tinian Island

22:56.013 --> 22:57.797
to prepare for delivery to the target.

22:59.550 --> 23:02.018
Buy a slicker. It's monsoon season.

23:14.565 --> 23:16.816

23:23.490 --> 23:25.158
Why don't you go ahead and start down

23:25.209 --> 23:28.161
and I'll finish everything up here?

23:28.212 --> 23:30.797
There's a car behind the munitions shed.

23:30.831 --> 23:32.799
Key's in the ignition.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.917
All right, I'll meet you down there.

23:37.838 --> 23:38.921
I'm not leaving.

23:40.841 --> 23:43.593
What?

23:43.595 --> 23:46.813
It'll be over in a thousandth of a second.

23:46.847 --> 23:48.398
Less.

23:48.432 --> 23:50.683
I'm not scared.

24:05.082 --> 24:06.616
<i>Why don't you finish up?</i>

24:19.129 --> 24:21.064
I told the Army

24:21.098 --> 24:23.850
setting off an atomic explosion

24:23.884 --> 24:26.069
in an exposed valley

24:26.103 --> 24:29.055
in a state where the weather
changes every 10 minutes

24:29.106 --> 24:32.358
is worse idea than the
Bolshevik revolution!

24:32.393 --> 24:34.644
<i>- (P.A. feedback squeals)

24:37.114 --> 24:40.366
Now what the hell is that, huh?

Balloons one through eight, do you read?

24:42.487 --> 24:44.654
- <i>(Music continues)</i>
- It's on every channel.

24:44.656 --> 24:46.072
Maybe the storm picking up the signal

24:46.123 --> 24:49.659
from an FM station or a practical joke.

24:49.661 --> 24:52.879
Not a funny one. No signal, no kaboom.

24:52.913 --> 24:56.132
You tell your Colonel
to stop the clock now!

24:56.166 --> 24:57.133
(Spits)

24:57.167 --> 24:58.501
Shit.

25:03.140 --> 25:04.891
Go on and check the power
on the I.S. You got it?

25:04.925 --> 25:07.260
You've got 20 minutes to fix this!

25:07.311 --> 25:10.179
Then we restart the countdown
with or without radios!

25:10.181 --> 25:12.565
Why don't you worry about
evacuating the blast zone?

25:12.599 --> 25:15.017
- I'll make the technical decisions.
- Darrow: Do we have a problem?

25:15.019 --> 25:17.653
Charlie: My wife, Jean
Tatlock, take your pick.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.739
Darrow: I'm still the commanding officer.

25:19.773 --> 25:21.407
I give the order.

25:21.442 --> 25:23.826
Charlie: Yeah? Well, my letter
should take care of that.

25:23.861 --> 25:25.278
What letter?

25:25.329 --> 25:27.280
The one I put in the mail
to the Secretary of War.

25:27.331 --> 25:29.699
You think Stimson cares
about a dead Communist?

25:29.701 --> 25:31.334
No. That's why I sent him

25:31.368 --> 25:33.002
your falsified German intelligence,

25:33.036 --> 25:35.705
the lies about Magpie that
you sold to the president,

25:35.707 --> 25:37.507
with Frank Winter's math attached

25:37.541 --> 25:40.927
in case he's curious
about how you forged it.

25:40.961 --> 25:43.379
Enjoy the fireworks.

you got your wish.

25:55.309 --> 25:57.527
Act of God.

25:57.561 --> 25:59.145
We can't start the countdown again

25:59.196 --> 26:02.064
until they get the
communication system back up.

26:02.066 --> 26:04.150
But maybe that will be enough
time for the wind to calm down.

26:04.201 --> 26:06.068
- How long will it take?
- Who knows?

26:06.070 --> 26:08.321
They've got to radio for a radio expert,

26:08.372 --> 26:12.158
but since there is no radio...

26:12.209 --> 26:13.910
They should have invited Frank.

26:13.912 --> 26:15.378
What?

26:15.412 --> 26:18.748
He got a job in a radio
shop after the first war.

26:18.750 --> 26:22.750
Once he wired up our chimney
flue into a giant antenna

26:23.003 --> 26:25.555
so he could listen to a
boxing match in Chicago.

26:25.589 --> 26:28.007
Huh.

26:29.259 --> 26:32.979
Um, Liza...

26:33.013 --> 26:37.013
I heard some things about Frank.

26:39.019 --> 26:41.737
You know the pretest? The explosives test?

26:41.772 --> 26:44.106
I know that it failed.

26:46.243 --> 26:49.612
They think that Frank was responsible.

26:52.366 --> 26:53.950
Responsible?

26:53.952 --> 26:57.620
He made it fail on purpose, they say.

27:00.257 --> 27:02.875
Fedowitz. Dr. Isaacs needs you.

28:19.703 --> 28:22.171
No, they sent me on a homicide mission.

28:22.205 --> 28:25.091
The plan... their plan
was to blow the thing up

28:25.125 --> 28:27.126
before the staff evacuated,

28:27.177 --> 28:28.878
<i>kill the whole brain trust.</i>

28:28.880 --> 28:32.298
So you already saved lives today.

28:32.349 --> 28:34.016
You changed the plan.

28:34.051 --> 28:35.551
Change it again.

28:35.553 --> 28:37.887
- Save yourself.
- It's too late for that.

28:37.889 --> 28:39.605
You're a Soviet spy.

28:39.640 --> 28:43.476
If you die up here sabotaging
America's super weapon,

28:43.527 --> 28:45.811
they're going to follow the bread crumbs.

28:45.862 --> 28:47.363
<i>And then what?</i>

28:52.069 --> 28:53.536
One bullet.

28:55.539 --> 28:58.124
One bullet in Sarajevo. 17 million dead.

28:58.158 --> 28:59.709
That was the First World War.

29:01.378 --> 29:03.379
If you die in this room, Jim,

29:03.413 --> 29:04.580
you won't end the second.

29:04.582 --> 29:06.215
You will start the third.

29:07.918 --> 29:09.135
We'll invade Japan.

29:09.169 --> 29:10.252
Not to fight the Japanese,

29:10.254 --> 29:11.754
but to throw out the Russians.

29:11.756 --> 29:15.057
<i>And from there, Korea, Manchuria,</i>

29:15.092 --> 29:17.226
casualties in the hundred-million range,

29:17.260 --> 29:20.513
and it'll drag on for years.

29:20.564 --> 29:24.100
And by then both sides
will have one of these.

29:24.102 --> 29:26.068
More than one.

29:26.103 --> 29:28.354
We cannot let anyone believe

29:28.405 --> 29:30.740
that a Soviet spy was responsible.

29:32.776 --> 29:34.610
They'll never believe
that it was an accident.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.583
They have to think it was me.

30:03.195 --> 30:05.780
- Hello.
- It's a little late.

30:05.831 --> 30:08.783
Well, it's not late. It's early.

30:08.834 --> 30:11.953
They call it a day pass
for a reason, ma'am.

30:12.004 --> 30:13.838
Either way, this one's expired.

30:15.841 --> 30:17.175
Oh.

30:17.209 --> 30:19.377
Well, Colonel Darrow gave me permission

30:19.379 --> 30:21.963
to attend services at the
Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe

30:22.014 --> 30:23.965
whenever I felt called to worship.

30:24.016 --> 30:27.018
Surely you have it written down somewhere.

30:32.858 --> 30:35.860
And would you mind giving this
back to him when he returns?

30:45.153 --> 30:46.370
<i>(Gate squeaks)</i>

30:46.405 --> 30:48.206
Thank you.

30:51.376 --> 30:53.828
I am the only story that
doesn't end in Truman and Stalin

30:53.879 --> 30:56.214
strangling each other
over a negotiating table.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.049
I'm no secret agent.

30:58.083 --> 31:01.002
I'm just a shell-shocked old
crank who had a change of heart.

31:01.053 --> 31:03.054
You don't get it, okay? I
can't go back down there.

31:03.088 --> 31:05.006
Oh, God, what are you
punishing yourself for, Jim?

31:05.057 --> 31:07.475
Whatever mistakes you made,
there is time to correct them.

31:07.509 --> 31:10.228
I don't want more time. I don't deserve it.

31:10.262 --> 31:12.430
<i>Why? Because you passed
secrets to an ally?</i>

31:12.432 --> 31:14.232
<i>I don't care what you did</i>

31:14.266 --> 31:16.150
<i>or what you think you deserve.</i>

31:16.184 --> 31:17.435
You changed the plan tonight.

31:17.437 --> 31:18.653
You didn't want to hurt anyone.

31:18.687 --> 31:21.355
- That is a good thing.
- Jeannie!

31:24.443 --> 31:26.077
Fritz's wife.

31:29.915 --> 31:32.450
She, uh...

31:32.452 --> 31:34.118
She found out.

31:37.456 --> 31:39.457
<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

31:42.461 --> 31:44.879
(ringing continues)

31:44.930 --> 31:47.181
Where's the 30-minute rocket?

31:47.215 --> 31:48.683
<i>(Ringing continues)</i>

31:48.717 --> 31:50.301
They stopped the countdown.

31:53.105 --> 31:54.855
We have to answer that.

31:54.890 --> 31:57.275
No, we can't... I told
them that I was leaving.

31:57.309 --> 31:58.693
They don't know anyone's up here.

31:58.727 --> 32:00.061
Do you think it's the wrong number?

32:00.112 --> 32:02.697
Someone knows.

32:02.731 --> 32:04.448
First they call, and then they knock.

32:04.483 --> 32:07.201
Just tell them you had
to recheck a connection.

32:07.235 --> 32:08.903
- <i>(Ringing continues)</i>
- (sighs)

32:08.954 --> 32:10.905
Someone has got to answer that phone,

32:10.956 --> 32:12.740
and you know it can't be me.

32:17.496 --> 32:19.747
(Ringing continues)

32:32.427 --> 32:33.894
Liza: <i>Hello, Frank?</i>

32:33.929 --> 32:36.180
<i>(continues indistinctly)</i>

32:41.486 --> 32:43.321
What?

32:49.695 --> 32:51.996
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

32:53.031 --> 32:54.532
<i>Hello?</i>

32:55.951 --> 32:57.201
Frank.

32:58.203 --> 32:59.837
Liza?

32:59.871 --> 33:02.840
<i>- (Music continues)
- (men shouting)</i>

33:02.874 --> 33:04.675
- <i>What are you doing here?</i>
- How did you...

33:04.710 --> 33:06.210
<i>Did you short out the radios?</i>

33:06.212 --> 33:07.461
<i>What... </i>

33:09.181 --> 33:12.550
Look, who else knows that I'm up here?

33:12.552 --> 33:13.801
<i>No one.</i>

33:16.805 --> 33:19.357
Frank...

33:19.391 --> 33:21.776
they're saying that you sabotaged the test.

33:21.810 --> 33:24.061
They're saying that you
sabotaged the explosives.

33:24.063 --> 33:28.032
I... you're going to get yourself shot.

33:32.037 --> 33:33.788
Nobody's going to shoot anyone.

33:33.822 --> 33:35.039
<i>Come down.</i>

33:36.575 --> 33:39.543
Listen.

33:39.578 --> 33:42.546
Listen, I need... I need you...

33:42.581 --> 33:45.583
to do something for me, all right?

33:45.585 --> 33:48.169
<i>The next car you see,</i>

33:48.220 --> 33:50.004
<i>I want you to get in it</i>

33:50.055 --> 33:54.008
<i>and I want you to get out
of the blast radius.</i>

33:54.059 --> 33:55.593
I'm not leaving till you're down.

33:55.595 --> 33:57.144
<i>Liza... Liza, listen.</i>

33:57.179 --> 34:00.598
Don't send up the cavalry.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.850
<i>The cavalry will shoot you, Frank.</i>

34:04.186 --> 34:06.687
Look, I've made a lot of mistakes.

34:08.273 --> 34:10.357
<i>I'm trying to unmake one tonight.</i>

34:12.860 --> 34:14.195
I don't know if you're still my wife,

34:14.246 --> 34:16.664
but, God, I'm still your husband

34:16.697 --> 34:18.449
<i>and I love you.</i>

34:20.952 --> 34:24.205
So just promise me...

34:24.255 --> 34:25.873
Promise me you'll leave now.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.428
<i>I'll find my way.</i>

34:31.630 --> 34:32.847
<i>(receiver clicks)</i>

34:32.880 --> 34:34.264
Frank?

34:36.885 --> 34:38.219
Frank?

34:38.270 --> 34:40.221
Man on P.A.: <i>Testing, testing.</i>

34:40.272 --> 34:43.808
<i>Testing! Testing.</i>

34:43.810 --> 34:45.943
<i>Testing! Testing.</i>

34:45.976 --> 34:48.813
- Testing.
- Man 2: <i> Okay, this is it.</i>

34:52.284 --> 34:53.868
That's it.

34:53.902 --> 34:57.902
Channel 18 is clear.

34:57.989 --> 35:00.875
Evacuate to Site C,

35:00.909 --> 35:04.378
zero minus 32 minutes.

35:04.412 --> 35:06.297
<i>- Let's go.
- We're good.</i>

35:06.331 --> 35:07.915
<i>- 32.
- Okay, well, take care, man.</i>

35:07.966 --> 35:10.000
(chatter continues)

35:10.002 --> 35:13.170
Man on P.A.: <i>Zero minus 30 minutes.</i>

35:13.172 --> 35:14.638
- <i>(rocket whistles)</i>
- See?

35:14.673 --> 35:17.091
There... there's the 30-minute rocket.

35:17.142 --> 35:19.176
They restarted the clock.

35:23.014 --> 35:26.767
You said that no one knew you were up here.

35:26.818 --> 35:29.904
You were never going to go through
with it, were you, Frank? Huh?

35:29.938 --> 35:33.023
You're a son of a bitch, but
you'd never do that to Liza.

35:36.695 --> 35:39.330
What are you really doing up here, Frank?

35:41.166 --> 35:43.284
Answer me!

35:43.335 --> 35:46.871
- <i>(Chatter on P.A.)</i>
- (men shouting)

35:48.707 --> 35:51.292
<i>(horn honking)</i>

35:58.350 --> 36:00.718
Tropical storm in the desert.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.937
Jazz on the shortwave.

36:02.971 --> 36:04.805
Maybe the universe is
trying to tell us something.

36:04.856 --> 36:06.724
Maybe you should listen.

36:06.726 --> 36:09.310
Maybe you should stop the countdown.

36:09.361 --> 36:11.145
You hear about your husband?

36:11.196 --> 36:13.948
Blew up the pretest,
then swooped in to fix it.

36:13.982 --> 36:16.534
- That's a new one.
- It's not too late.

36:16.568 --> 36:18.152
We've come this far.

36:18.203 --> 36:20.538
If we don't finish the
job, it was all for nothing.

36:20.572 --> 36:22.740
That's what Frank used to say.

36:22.742 --> 36:24.542
He tried to bury Little Boy, too.

36:24.576 --> 36:27.545
Raided the budget to pay for your research.

36:30.582 --> 36:32.249
Ladies first.

36:33.752 --> 36:35.836
Frank...

36:35.887 --> 36:39.006
Man on P.A.: <i>All personnel must
leave the area immediately.</i>

36:39.057 --> 36:42.927
<i>All personnel must
leave the area immediately.</i>

36:45.263 --> 36:48.983
<i>All personnel must evacuate
Site B immediately.</i>

36:49.017 --> 36:53.017
<i>I repeat, all personnel must
evacuate Site B immediately.</i>

36:54.106 --> 36:56.523
(men chattering)

36:56.575 --> 36:59.493
Fritz! Frank's in the tower.

36:59.527 --> 37:00.911
What do you mean? What tower?

37:00.946 --> 37:02.830
The "tower" tower? How do you know?

37:02.864 --> 37:04.415
I spoke to him on the phone.

37:04.449 --> 37:07.585
- You have to radio it in.
- No, Fritz.

37:07.619 --> 37:09.253
You know what they think he is.

37:11.256 --> 37:12.840
Well, is he?

37:12.874 --> 37:15.593
Man: <i>Let's go, get on board!</i>

37:15.627 --> 37:17.544
I don't honestly know.

37:19.631 --> 37:23.050
But I know the Army will shoot him.

37:23.101 --> 37:25.052
Jim was up in the crow's nest... Meeks.

37:25.103 --> 37:27.388
If Frank was there, he would have seen him.

37:27.439 --> 37:29.023
- I'll take care of it.
- Meeks?

37:29.057 --> 37:32.393
I'll take care of it.
Give me that radio. Now!

37:32.444 --> 37:35.562
- <i>(P.A. chatter continues)</i>
- (men shouting)

37:35.614 --> 37:38.115
J.M., confirm your location.

37:39.451 --> 37:40.985
J.M., do you copy?

37:40.987 --> 37:43.153
Jim!

37:43.155 --> 37:45.239
Man on P.A.: <i>all vehicles are
leaving Site B immediately.</i>

37:45.290 --> 37:47.825
<i>Get to your assigned vehicles immediately.</i>

37:49.828 --> 37:51.712
What the hell is this?

37:51.746 --> 37:53.664
<i>What did you do?</i>

37:56.084 --> 37:57.635
I hijacked the radios.

37:57.669 --> 38:00.638
To what? To send out a distress call?

38:00.672 --> 38:02.423
- Huh? S.O.S.?
- No.

38:02.474 --> 38:05.225
Then what? Huh? What?

38:05.260 --> 38:06.560
<i>You're going to filibuster?</i>

38:06.594 --> 38:07.761
<i>You're going to stall for time?</i>

38:07.812 --> 38:08.846
I thought if I stopped the clock,

38:08.848 --> 38:11.065
I Could...

38:11.099 --> 38:12.433
I could talk you down.

38:12.484 --> 38:15.486
Oh, and then you could
rewire the detonators?

38:18.657 --> 38:21.859
God, after everything,

38:21.861 --> 38:24.611
you are just like the rest of them.

38:24.663 --> 38:26.613
You want the Army to drop it.

38:26.665 --> 38:30.451
Trust me, Jim, the Army
doesn't give a shit what I want.

38:30.502 --> 38:32.536
They're going to drop
this thing either way.

38:32.538 --> 38:35.089
Not if it doesn't work, they won't.

38:35.123 --> 38:37.508
There's another one where this came from!

38:42.130 --> 38:45.683
Little Boy is already
headed across the Pacific

38:45.717 --> 38:47.685
on the USS Indianapolis.

38:49.721 --> 38:53.107
The ship has sailed, Jim.

38:53.141 --> 38:54.525
Literally.

39:18.383 --> 39:20.718
No, that's...

39:20.752 --> 39:23.337
They haven't even tested Little Boy.

39:23.388 --> 39:25.005
- How can they be...
- They don't need to test it.

39:25.056 --> 39:26.924
It's a simple machine.

39:27.926 --> 39:29.476
All of this, it's just...

39:29.511 --> 39:32.346
It's just legwork, Jim.

39:32.397 --> 39:33.764
Somewhere along the line,

39:33.766 --> 39:36.183
someone set off a chain reaction.

39:37.936 --> 39:39.737
I don't know, maybe it was me

39:39.771 --> 39:41.405
the day I knocked on Einstein's door.

39:41.439 --> 39:44.358
But it's snowballing, exponential,

39:44.409 --> 39:47.578
and nothing you or I do
tonight is going to stop it.

39:49.197 --> 39:51.198
Maybe you can live with it.

39:53.201 --> 39:55.369
I betrayed my country,

39:55.420 --> 39:57.955
<i>my friends.</i>

39:57.957 --> 39:59.456
And I betrayed Sid Liao...

40:01.593 --> 40:03.627
for the sake of this...

40:03.629 --> 40:07.598
This thing I don't even believe in anymore.

40:10.218 --> 40:11.802
<i>Maybe you knew that already.</i>

40:14.806 --> 40:16.223
Sid.

40:18.443 --> 40:20.978
That's exactly what
brought you here, isn't it?

40:23.982 --> 40:27.151
All of this...
It was for him.

40:35.827 --> 40:39.827
God, I keep rationalizing
all the lesser evils,

40:40.832 --> 40:43.000
hoping they'll add up to a greater good.

40:44.836 --> 40:47.588
But it's just...

40:47.639 --> 40:50.174
It's just bad math.

40:50.176 --> 40:54.176
<i>There's always some variable
you didn't account for.</i>

40:57.265 --> 40:58.849
So I'm through.

41:01.269 --> 41:04.822
I'm through trying to predict the future.

41:04.856 --> 41:08.408
I don't know if the world's
better off if the test fails,

41:08.443 --> 41:11.829
<i>but I do know that if you
sabotage it, your life is over.</i>

41:11.863 --> 41:13.247
<i>And whatever it is you have done... </i>

41:13.281 --> 41:15.582
My life is already over.

41:15.617 --> 41:19.036
No. No, that's the thing, Jim.

41:19.038 --> 41:22.256
There is a way out.

41:22.290 --> 41:24.041
You're going to cooperate
with the government.

41:24.043 --> 41:25.375
<i>- (Door opens)
- (Fritz grunts)</i>

41:28.713 --> 41:30.881
What... what the hell is going on?

41:30.883 --> 41:33.050
Fritz?

41:33.052 --> 41:35.219
You're supposed to be
in one of the bunkers.

41:35.221 --> 41:38.272
Yeah! We all are!

41:38.306 --> 41:40.274
Jesus!

41:40.308 --> 41:44.308
Frank, what are you doing up here?

41:46.314 --> 41:47.865
I rewired the detonators...

41:49.901 --> 41:52.236
so the test would fail.

41:52.238 --> 41:53.654
(Groans)

41:53.705 --> 41:55.072
Somebody had to save the world

41:55.074 --> 41:56.573
from the guys who were saving the world.

41:56.575 --> 41:58.492
(Groans)

41:58.543 --> 42:00.661
Jesus Christ, Frank.

42:00.712 --> 42:02.296
I'm not even saying that you're wrong,

42:02.330 --> 42:05.332
but if the gadget doesn't
kill you, the Army will.

42:05.383 --> 42:07.501
(Chuckles)

42:07.552 --> 42:10.671
That's what Jim said.

42:10.722 --> 42:14.675
He's been trying to talk me
down for the last three hours.

42:14.726 --> 42:16.760
He just didn't have the heart to shoot me.

42:18.263 --> 42:19.897
Frank.

42:19.931 --> 42:23.567
You were... you were right, Jim.

42:26.104 --> 42:27.938
I have too much to live for.

42:31.576 --> 42:33.410
Fritz: <i>Look, we got to get out of here!</i>

42:33.444 --> 42:35.412
We got to get out of the blast zone.

42:35.446 --> 42:37.581
Come on! I mean, did you
fix the gadget or what?

42:40.118 --> 42:42.035
Come on.

42:43.454 --> 42:45.339
Six hands are better than two.

42:45.373 --> 42:47.541
Fritz: <i>Oh, my God. Are you serious?</i>

42:47.592 --> 42:51.592
Next time, maybe leave
yourself a 30-minute buffer.

42:56.134 --> 42:58.478
Put that gun back in your bandolier.

42:58.479 --> 43:00.404
You're not going to need it.

43:28.808 --> 43:32.808
Man on P.A.: <i>Zero minus eight minutes.</i>

43:32.946 --> 43:35.447
Man 2: <i>Of course, here. There you are, sir.</i>

43:35.482 --> 43:36.949
<i>You've got to take it.</i>

43:36.983 --> 43:38.734
Sir.

43:38.785 --> 43:40.202
Ambulances are standing by

43:40.236 --> 43:41.987
at their preset locations in Albuquerque.

43:41.989 --> 43:44.456
Let's hope they get to
play pinochle all night.

43:45.458 --> 43:46.658

It's frogs.

Jim.

47:07.994 --> 47:09.361
What are we going to do?

47:09.363 --> 47:12.364
- What?
- What? Up in the tower.

47:12.366 --> 47:14.366
Frank. That wasn't him playing Tarzan.

47:14.368 --> 47:17.586
That was treason.

47:17.620 --> 47:18.954
I don't know what you're thinking.

47:19.005 --> 47:20.339
I know this isn't my decision alone,

47:20.373 --> 47:22.374
but I do not think that
we should tell anyone.

47:22.376 --> 47:26.178
I mean, he was just trying
to do the right thing,

47:26.212 --> 47:27.846
whatever that is anymore.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.382

Man on radio: <i>Zero minus 90 seconds.</i>

It was me.

47:47.066 --> 47:48.066
What?

47:51.037 --> 47:55.037
It wasn't Frank. It was me.

47:56.659 --> 47:58.827
I gave the bomb to the Soviet Union.

47:58.878 --> 48:01.997
I Thought...

48:02.048 --> 48:05.217
I thought the world would be better...

48:05.251 --> 48:06.752
after Sid.

48:08.421 --> 48:11.006
Oh, Jim.

48:11.057 --> 48:12.841

- Oh, boy.

But if I could take it back,

48:23.853 --> 48:26.238
I swear to God...

48:26.272 --> 48:28.023
I'm sorry, Fritz.

48:28.074 --> 48:31.076
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.

48:33.079 --> 48:35.080
Wait, who got hurt?

48:40.703 --> 48:42.087
Jeannie.

48:49.295 --> 48:51.263
Wait, wait. Jeannie?

48:58.221 --> 49:00.689
I'm sorry. (Crying)

49:00.723 --> 49:01.773
