00:07.675 --> 00:10.644
- Good night, boys.
- Okay, good night.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.172
- Good job.
- Thanks. See you tomorrow.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.212
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

00:34.468 --> 00:36.766
Old man, I've told you before,
you're trespassing.

00:36.937 --> 00:40.600
How can I be trespassing on land
my people owned for thousands of years?

00:40.775 --> 00:43.744
Out of my way, chief.
I've got a job to get done.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.071
You don't understand the consequences
of what you're doing.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.978
Are you threatening me?

00:50.551 --> 00:54.317
How can I be threatening you?
I'm just an old man.

00:55.089 --> 00:59.219
You got a problem,
take it up with the big guy.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.458
Get the hell out of here.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.534
What are the police doing here?

04:35.208 --> 04:38.837
There was some sort of an accident
last night, an explosion.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.004
Maybe this will convince LuthorCorp
to get out of Smallville.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.118
It's an office park, Pete, not a toxic waste
dump. What's the harm in that?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.947
I'll race you back to Miller's Bend.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.887
Hey, kids, watch yourselves!

05:39.706 --> 05:41.139
Lana?

05:41.308 --> 05:42.707
Don't move.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.404
- I'm fine.
- You're in shock. You fell over 100 feet.

05:50.650 --> 05:54.916
- You don't have a scratch on you.
- Just lucky, I guess.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.852
- That's incredible luck you have.
- Where did you come from?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.857
I was just over there doing research
for my grandfather.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.023
The landslide must have
opened up that wall.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.563
I didn't even know
there were caves down here.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.793
If LuthorCorp has its way
then there won't be anymore.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.631
I'm Kyla, by the way.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.944
Clark.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.171
Clark Kent.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.077
- The invincible Clark Kent, apparently.
- Clark!

06:26.519 --> 06:28.111
You down there?

06:28.288 --> 06:29.653
Yeah, Pete, I'm all right.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.452
Hey, man, you gonna need some help,
or can you jump your way out?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.221
I've got some company down here.
He's a funny guy.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.059
As long as you're all right.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.030
Oh, my God.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.264
What is it?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.267
It's the legend of Naman.

06:49.142 --> 06:53.010
My ancestors have passed down
this story for generations.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.808
They said it had been written
in the earth long ago...

06:56.983 --> 07:00.475
...but nobody ever knew where it was
until now.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.921
You don't understand.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.758
My grandfather's been searching
for this wall his whole life.

07:12.933 --> 07:17.199
It was prophesied that Naman would fall
from the skies in a rain of fire.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.634
They say Naman will have the strength
of 10 men...

07:19.806 --> 07:22.866
...and will be able to start fires
with his eyes.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.374
It probably sounds silly.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.678
Not to me.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.215
I've gotta tell my grandfather
about this.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.680
Come on, I'll show you the way out.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.910
Try and keep up.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.169
- It's an octagon. It's a very common shape.
- What about the story?

08:01.348 --> 08:05.512
How many people fall to Earth in a meteor
shower and can shoot fire from their eyes?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.887
I understand it's important for you
to figure out where you came from...

08:10.056 --> 08:13.787
...but those drawings could have
a hundred different interpretations.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.594
You pulled this from the spaceship
before it closed.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.391
- I don't see what...
- These same symbols are in the caves.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.963
Kyla's grandfather has studied
the story of Naman.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.365
Maybe he can read this.

08:24.704 --> 08:28.140
I want you to be careful
what you tell those people, Clark.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.370
If they can tell me who or what I am,
it's worth the risk.

08:31.544 --> 08:34.876
We don't know anything about Kyla.
Or her grandfather, for that matter.

08:35.715 --> 08:39.674
I know. That's why
I invited them over for dinner.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.078
According to the legend,
a man came from the stars...

08:43.256 --> 08:46.589
...and fell in love with the mother
of our people.

08:47.060 --> 08:52.259
Out of that forbidden affair,
the Kawatche people were born.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.458
- Do you know which star he came from?
- The legend only tells us...

08:55.635 --> 09:00.538
...that he left one day and flew back into
the sky, promising he would send another.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.835
That would be this Naman person
you've been talking about, right?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.808
Yes. Of course,
that was 500 years ago.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.914
He's a little late.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.882
You're not from around here,
are you, Clark?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.517
Actually, Clark is adopted.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.025
These symbols seem to make up
some sort of alphabet.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.666
That's the really weird part.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.634
Our people don't have a written language.

09:30.804 --> 09:36.208
I've seen a symbol here or there on
artifacts, but never in a pattern before.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.837
- So you don't know what they mean?
- He studied ancient languages.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.675
I'm sure with some time
he can decipher the symbols.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.181
If Luthor doesn't get at them
before we do.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.083
Mom, maybe you can talk to Mr. Luthor.

09:51.891 --> 09:56.328
- You know Lionel Luthor?
- Know him? Mom is his executive assistant.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.488
Well, Clark, I'll do what I can,
but it isn't that easy.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.157
The situation isn't that black-and-white.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.066
That complex will create 1000
desperately needed jobs.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.301
And you think that's more important
than these caves?

10:14.380 --> 10:18.441
So does anyone want coffee
with their pie?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.619
You wanna have a look?

10:30.430 --> 10:33.126
I kind of like seeing them
with my own eyes.

10:39.572 --> 10:44.009
So these legends, you don't think
that they're like Venus and Apollo...

10:44.177 --> 10:46.338
...and all the other myths?

10:47.347 --> 10:50.839
Just because something's a myth
doesn't make it not true.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.914
Here.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.252
Do you see the bright one right there?

10:58.558 --> 11:02.790
If you follow the stars around it,
it makes the shape of a wolf's head.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.525
See how one of the eyes is missing?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.000
Our ancestors say that there
used to be a star there...

11:10.737 --> 11:13.228
...and that's where Naman came from.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.340
I wonder what happened to it.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.403
You tell me.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.972
You're the one that fell from the sky.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.182
Lana.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.726
Your message sounded urgent,
so I just came over.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.625
I didn't realize you had company.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.762
Oh, thanks. Lana, this is Kyla.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.734
Hi. I don't think I've seen you
at school before.

11:44.904 --> 11:48.567
Oh, I go to Grandville. I'm just here
doing research for my grandfather...

11:48.741 --> 11:52.370
...and rescuing any guys
that happen to fall into my life.

11:53.746 --> 11:54.974
How did you two meet?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.776
In these caves
under the new LuthorCorp site.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.350
That's why I called you.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.579
If this new complex goes ahead,
the caves will be destroyed...

12:02.755 --> 12:04.882
...along with paintings
Kyla's ancestors drew.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.958
They're our only link to the past.

12:07.126 --> 12:10.493
Defending a good cause sounds like
something Henry Small might be into.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.564
We're not exactly at the
father-daughter favor stage yet.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.466
But I'll ask him anyway.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.437
Thank you, Lana.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.274
No problem.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.748
So it's not the first time
he's been involved.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.886
Thank you, sheriff. I'm glad you told me.
It's very enlightening.

12:34.053 --> 12:37.454
- We'll keep you posted, Mr. Luthor.
- Thank you.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.520
I thought the police were done
with their investigation.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.025
The sheriff's not ready
to call it an accident.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.959
Apparently Joseph Willowbrook...

12:45.131 --> 12:47.861
...the Native American
who's spearheading the protests...

12:48.034 --> 12:50.229
...has a history of civil disobedience.

12:50.403 --> 12:55.067
- They think it was sabotage?
- Let's just say they're not ruling it out.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.468
Maybe I should have done this project
in Grandville.

12:59.646 --> 13:02.410
Smallville needs those jobs.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.279
I sent flowers to the foreman's family...

13:07.453 --> 13:11.014
...and I arranged for you to do
a condolence call tomorrow afternoon.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.957
Good thinking. I don't want
to be perceived as uncaring.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.427
I didn't do it for that reason.
It's the right thing to do.

13:20.933 --> 13:25.597
There are times when I'm with you
that I'd swear I was talking to my wife.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.239
She was a lot like you, Martha.
The same unflinching honesty.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.010
I miss that.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.646
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hi, Lex.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.648
Lex. Always good to hear your voice, son.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.948
Well, I need to get home early today,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.792
Believe me, Lex, I know how hard
you've been working.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.624
You engineered an employee buyout
of the Smallville plant.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.528
Now...

13:54.867 --> 14:00.066
...Iook at you, you're building an empire
of your own without my help.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.470
But your success shouldn't prevent us
from joining forces...

14:03.643 --> 14:06.840
...when a lucrative venture comes along.

14:07.013 --> 14:11.279
Come on, Dad. You don't need me as
an investor in some random office park.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.615
No, not as an investor, Lex.
I want you as my partner.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.280
Blame it on a brief bout
of sentimentality.

14:19.759 --> 14:23.126
Sentimentality is synonymous
with vulnerability.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.130
You taught me that.
You're on your own.

14:35.742 --> 14:39.234
The pictographs are
a lot more detailed up here.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.573
What do they say?

14:41.814 --> 14:47.411
It promises that one day,
Naman will protect the entire world.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.888
Luthor's bulldozers.
It's been happening all week.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.528
I don't know if it's safe for us
to be here right now.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.789
Clark, get up here,
you have to see this.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.736
What is it?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.897
It's Sageeth.
He's like a brother to Naman.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.475
Legend has it one day
he'll turn against Naman...

15:11.644 --> 15:15.705
...and together they'll be the balance
between good and evil.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.083
Who's that?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.084
It's the woman he's destined to be with.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.633
It was handed down
through the women in my family.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.767
I don't even know how old it is.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.927
- How'd you do that?
- Adrenaline, I guess.

16:12.104 --> 16:15.596
Yesterday you didn't have
a scratch on you and...

16:15.775 --> 16:19.302
What, you can shoot fire
out your eyes too?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.740
Oh, my God.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.180
I was just joking.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.310
You...

16:28.488 --> 16:31.787
- You really are Naman.
- I don't know what I am.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.057
You don't seem very freaked out.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.697
Because I know what it's like
to be different.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.105
Clark, it's okay.

16:48.207 --> 16:52.143
Maybe this could explain everything
I've been feeling in the last few days.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.643
There are a lot of things about me
I can't explain.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.805
Clark, you don't have to.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.975
I grew up around a lot of things
that seemed unexplainable.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.483
Yeah, but I'm...

17:02.655 --> 17:07.285
You try and use logic and reason
to try and make sense of it...

17:07.460 --> 17:09.859
...but you just have to give in.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.011
Thanks for your help, Mr. Small.
It's really great of you to do this.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.706
To be honest, I'm glad you called.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.181
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.986
Lana, I got the test results back.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.659
Looks like we share the same DNA.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.469
So you really are...

17:54.741 --> 17:57.005
You're my father.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.870
I don't think I've earned that place
in your life yet.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.541
But I want to.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.718
If it's not too late.

18:24.337 --> 18:29.297
Mrs. Kent, if you're looking for Clark, he
and Kyla are down documenting the caves.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.273
Actually, I'm here
on a more official capacity.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.074
Mr. Luthor would like to sit down with you
and discuss your concerns.

18:36.249 --> 18:41.277
I'm usually better at spotting the wolf
in sheep's clothing.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.686
Mr. Willowbrook...

18:43.856 --> 18:47.223
...I understand the importance
of these caves better than anyone...

18:47.393 --> 18:50.988
...but there must be a way for you
and LuthorCorp to coexist peacefully.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.291
You'll have to forgive my skepticism...

18:53.466 --> 18:57.232
...but every time Native Americans
are asked to peacefully coexist...

18:57.403 --> 19:00.270
...we've been killed
or forced onto reservations.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.841
- Please, Mr. Willowbrook...
- You may get your day in court yet, Joseph.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.138
Based on discoveries in the caves...

19:06.312 --> 19:09.338
...this cease and desist order
is effective immediately.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.415
A hearing is set for a week from today.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.076
Tell your boss if he wants to talk,
I'll see him in court.

19:16.222 --> 19:19.783
Sheriff, if you're here to harass me
about my permit to protest...

19:19.959 --> 19:23.326
Joseph, I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Dan Hammond...

19:23.496 --> 19:26.693
...the foreman of this construction site.
- There has to be a mistake.

19:26.866 --> 19:31.064
We found a towel in Mr. Willowbrook's
trash with blood that matched the victim's.

19:31.237 --> 19:35.071
Is this LuthorCorp's idea
of peaceful coexistence?

19:35.375 --> 19:38.538
- Framing an innocent man?
- Come with me, sir.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.279
Lex.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.014
I'm gonna have to call you back.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.152
Clark. Is everything all right?

19:54.660 --> 19:57.857
I need to raise bail money for Joseph
Willowbrook. He's being set up.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.998
I think by LuthorCorp.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.369
That's a pretty serious accusation, Clark.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.062
Don't get me wrong,
I'm impressed by your conviction...

20:07.573 --> 20:09.564
...but going head-to-head
with my father?

20:09.742 --> 20:12.336
You're a little like David
trying to slay Goliath.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.873
Where do you stand?

20:14.714 --> 20:19.481
Any culture that's left a legacy to endure
for centuries has earned my respect.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.743
I'm afraid it's a losing battle.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.445
Didn't David beat Goliath?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.621
Your newfound advocacy
wouldn't have anything to do...

20:27.794 --> 20:30.661
...with a beautiful, doe-eyed
crusader, would it?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.394
Your mother told me about Kyla.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.532
You ever wondered if you were destined
to be with someone?

20:38.704 --> 20:42.765
You're asking someone who's been fighting
his destiny his entire life.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.044
I'm a little surprised to see
you've moved on so quickly.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.609
What happened to Lana?

20:54.220 --> 20:57.815
It's a completely different feeling
when the person likes you back.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.124
Lex, please, can you help me
with the bail money?

21:03.296 --> 21:07.926
I'm sorry, Clark, but I don't make it
a practice to bail out alleged murderers.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.464
Maybe I can get you
to change your mind.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.973
Thank you.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.440
Hey. So it looks like Clark pulled you
into his activist phase.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.778
Between him and Henry,
I didn't have a choice.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.217
They are fighting
for something really important.

21:29.388 --> 21:30.616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.088
I've never seen Clark this passionate
about a cause.

21:33.259 --> 21:36.194
I don't think the cause is the only thing
he's passionate about.

21:36.362 --> 21:41.197
Yeah, so, what is it about Kyla
that breaks through Clark's shining armor?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.835
I always thought Clark
had trouble letting people in.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.369
I guess he was just waiting
for the right one.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.997
You know, Clark's sudden interest in Kyla
wouldn't have anything...

21:50.176 --> 21:51.803
- Hello.
- Thanks.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.709
Wouldn't have anything to do with the
letter that you wrote Whitney, would it?

21:55.882 --> 21:58.009
I saw it on the counter this morning.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.618
It's one of the pitfalls
of having a roommate.

22:01.621 --> 22:05.182
Whitney and I have been writing
to each other every week since he left.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.587
Actually, I've been writing him.
He hasn't really responded much lately.

22:10.129 --> 22:13.530
Am I being really evil if I suggest
that maybe he's trying to move on?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.064
I don't know.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.931
Whitney's shared more with me since
we broke up than when we were together.

22:19.105 --> 22:23.132
What is with guys and emotions? The closer
you get, the more they keep everything in.

22:23.309 --> 22:26.005
Must be some sort
of a protective instinct.

22:26.279 --> 22:30.079
Maybe we should just stop falling for guys
who are trying to save the world.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.148
Not that I don't find the stench
of a cave invigorating...

22:36.322 --> 22:38.415
...but what does this have to do
with Joseph?

22:38.591 --> 22:42.527
I wanted you to see them for themselves.
This is what he wants to protect.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.261
Incredible.

22:45.431 --> 22:48.229
These may be more impressive
than the caves at Lascaux.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.234
Joseph and Kyla are trying to get a team
to authenticate them.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.862
So you're doing all of this
for some cave paintings?

22:55.241 --> 22:58.938
I'm doing it because I think it's important
for people to understand their past.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.547
- Don't you?
- Looks like a fascinating story.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.013
Makes you wonder if the people
who drew these...

23:05.184 --> 23:07.846
...thought we'd be here
100 years later looking at them.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.253
Somehow I think they did.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.052
Lex, these caves are part of our history.

23:14.226 --> 23:18.094
Saving these paintings might be
the most important thing you'll ever do.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.624
What do you think, Lex?

23:21.300 --> 23:24.167
Maybe more important
than anything we can imagine.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.707
I can't believe you got Grandpa out
so quickly.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.545
Thank you, Clark.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.114
I don't know how I feel
about the fact...

23:39.285 --> 23:41.412
...that it was Luthor money
that bailed me out.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.750
- Not all Luthors are the same.
- Why are you doing all this?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.054
It's for a good cause.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.865
Mom? Thought you'd be at work.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.163
I was running an errand
and I wanted to come by.

23:59.338 --> 24:03.866
Mr. Willowbrook, I'm sorry you got
tangled up in the murder investigation.

24:04.043 --> 24:09.345
People don't get tangled up in things
like this, Mrs. Kent, they get set up.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.712
I don't think more false accusations
are going to help anyone's situation.

24:13.886 --> 24:17.049
Mom, someone from LuthorCorp
put the bloody towel in Joseph's trash.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.555
You may have come here
with good intentions...

24:19.725 --> 24:22.193
...but it's clear
where your allegiances lie.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.829
Kyla, I think we need to go.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.874
Thank you.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.341
Anything new in Joseph's case?

24:42.515 --> 24:45.609
You know, Clark, a simple "Hello, Chloe"
goes a long way.

24:45.785 --> 24:49.482
- I know. I'm sorry, I'm just a little...
- Obsessed? I've noticed.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.987
I just got off the phone
with the coroner's office.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.956
They finished the autopsy
and there's a new development.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.891
I guess they found teeth marks
in the foreman's bones.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.056
- What kind of teeth marks?
- Canis lupus.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.757
Wolf.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.493
Takes Joseph off the hook.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.729
Still a few notches this side of normal.

25:06.906 --> 25:10.467
I mean, wolves have been extinct
in Smallville for 90 years.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.306
The look on your face tells me
you have a Wall of Weird explanation.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.537
Don't kill the messenger...

25:16.716 --> 25:21.210
...but I found out that Kyla's tribe name
translates into "skinwalkers."

25:23.122 --> 25:25.750
What is this, some sort of tribal ritual?

25:25.925 --> 25:30.123
It's a Native American myth
where the humans transform into animals.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.959
- It's just a legend.
- Clark, sometimes legends are true.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.398
It's not the first time Joseph's
been arrested for his radical tactics.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.095
Joseph's not a murderer.

27:03.489 --> 27:07.255
Well, what do you know?
You do still live here.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.395
Oh, Kyla called for you.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.326
Twice.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.695
You two certainly seem
to be getting pretty serious.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.303
Yeah, I can be myself with her.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.634
For the first time in my life
I feel like everything fits.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.071
Like we're destined to be together.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.246
But still there's something wrong.

27:30.283 --> 27:32.547
Why don't you have a seat, son.

27:36.289 --> 27:37.551
What's up?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.625
I have these feelings for Kyla.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.263
I don't wanna doubt her...

27:45.898 --> 27:48.594
...but I'm not sure
she's being honest with me.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.826
Well, Clark, not everybody's
exactly what they seem.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.700
I mean, we should know that
better than anybody.

27:56.809 --> 28:00.176
I think she knows more about
the foreman's death than she's telling me.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.610
Mom?

28:05.084 --> 28:06.415
Mom, what's wrong?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.579
A wolf tried to attack me.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.557
Lex.

28:21.133 --> 28:24.796
Have I done something
in the recent past to offend you?

28:24.971 --> 28:27.565
There are so many ways
I could answer that question, Dad.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.174
I am referring to the fact
that you posted bail...

28:30.343 --> 28:34.177
...for a man who allegedly murdered
my foreman.

28:34.347 --> 28:37.316
Don't tell me you're afraid
of an old man.

28:38.784 --> 28:43.221
I'm sure you know that this project
has become a public relations disaster...

28:43.389 --> 28:46.051
...but now you have added
an entirely new angle...

28:46.225 --> 28:50.594
...for those damn tree-huggers
to exploit.

28:50.763 --> 28:55.166
You're right about the PR nightmare,
but perhaps we can give it a positive spin.

28:56.535 --> 29:01.302
Is that your cryptic way of saying
you've reconsidered my proposition, Lex?

29:01.474 --> 29:04.307
- No.
- No.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.880
I'm offering to take this project
off your hands.

29:09.582 --> 29:12.551
I'll match dollar for dollar
what you've sunk into the complex.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.276
Buy me out?

29:14.453 --> 29:17.945
What advantage would you get
out of such an impulsive act?

29:18.124 --> 29:22.561
The satisfaction of seeing
a local treasure preserved forever.

29:22.728 --> 29:27.358
No, I know you too well to believe
you've become an activist, Lex.

29:28.367 --> 29:33.168
There's something about that land
that is extremely valuable.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.671
And you know what it is.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.794
Hi.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.156
- Thought I was supposed to meet you later.
- I needed to talk to you.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.498
Is everything okay?

30:04.670 --> 30:08.766
Kyla, I've been more open with you
than almost anyone ever.

30:08.941 --> 30:12.206
It's okay, Clark.
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret.

30:12.378 --> 30:16.974
I know. I trust you. That's what
makes this so much more weird.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.186
What do you know about skinwalkers?

30:26.659 --> 30:29.389
Have you been studying up for me?

30:29.562 --> 30:33.498
The stories say that people can turn
into animals. Are they true?

30:37.236 --> 30:40.296
The visitor from the stars supposedly
brought special green stones.

30:40.473 --> 30:42.964
They had really strange effects
on the people.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.702
That's when they said
the first skinwalkers appeared.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.436
So they're real.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.638
It's like you said,
they're just stories.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.475
Like the legend of Naman
is just a story?

30:55.888 --> 30:59.119
I know how important your grandfather
is to you, but I need to know...

30:59.291 --> 31:01.384
...is it possible he's a skinwalker?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.824
I can't believe you're doing this.

31:03.996 --> 31:07.329
My mom was attacked by a wolf after
an argument with your grandfather...

31:07.500 --> 31:09.661
...and the foreman was mauled
by a wolf.

31:09.835 --> 31:13.396
- You can't think he's a murderer!
- He'd do anything to save the caves.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.869
I thought you were on our side.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.770
The paintings are important,
but not enough to kill people.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.140
If this is how you think of us, maybe
we weren't meant to be together.

31:21.514 --> 31:23.379
My grandfather's right.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.211
Lionel Luthor controls you all.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.736
Lex?

32:53.973 --> 32:55.838
Who's there?

33:42.388 --> 33:44.015
Joseph!

33:55.468 --> 33:57.368
- Don't move!
- No, no, don't shoot!

33:58.304 --> 33:59.635
Joseph...

34:11.583 --> 34:13.710
Joseph!

34:14.987 --> 34:16.750
Joseph.

34:34.607 --> 34:36.370
Kyla?

34:36.542 --> 34:38.100
No.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.766
No!

34:40.279 --> 34:41.974
Kyla?

34:42.148 --> 34:45.777
Oh, are you okay?
Come here. You're okay.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.578
Come here.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.987
You all right?

34:51.290 --> 34:54.190
I didn't wanna hurt the foreman
or your mother, Clark.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.818
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

34:57.997 --> 34:59.225
I didn't want to lie...

34:59.398 --> 35:02.765
...but I saw the look in your eye
when you thought it was my grandfather.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.459
I'm sorry, Kyla.

35:06.906 --> 35:09.875
You're the first person
I thought I could trust.

35:10.042 --> 35:14.103
I knew that you knew what it felt like
to carry such a big secret.

35:16.048 --> 35:19.575
- I have to get you to the hospital.
- Clark, stay with me.

35:22.655 --> 35:24.714
I'm sorry.

35:26.826 --> 35:30.694
I'm sorry I can't be the one
for you, Naman.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.332
No.

36:15.808 --> 36:19.005
- Mr. Luthor, we're all shut down here, sir.
- What's the problem?

36:19.645 --> 36:21.704
Some kid thinks he's a hero.

36:21.881 --> 36:23.781
Clark?

36:24.149 --> 36:26.583
I'm indebted to your son
for his courage yesterday...

36:26.752 --> 36:28.845
...but I thought you talked
to him about this.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.683
I did, and I agree with him.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.156
Are you willing
to lose your job over this?

36:36.095 --> 36:37.722
That's up to you.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.661
Martha?

36:40.833 --> 36:42.562
Martha?

37:03.055 --> 37:04.784
Thank you, Clark.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.391
Kyla was right to believe in you.

37:09.762 --> 37:11.354
I didn't save her.

37:12.865 --> 37:15.129
You did what you could.

37:15.668 --> 37:17.033
Know this:

37:17.202 --> 37:21.036
Kyla had faith in you and so do I.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.235
Whatever your destiny...

37:26.845 --> 37:29.211
...for the true one in your life.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.225
Dad, you always told me
to choose my battles wisely.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.567
I hope I didn't use
such an obvious cliche.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.574
You should have taken my offer
on this land.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.042
- What's this?
- In light of the petition drive...

38:01.213 --> 38:04.808
...the state has decided to exercise
the Historic Artifacts Amendment...

38:04.984 --> 38:07.282
...and buy you out
at 30 cents on the dollar.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.520
You'll be happy to hear
LexCorp has secured the contract...

38:10.689 --> 38:12.919
...for the preservation of this entire area.

38:13.092 --> 38:18.086
Altruism is not in your blood, Lex,
believe me.

38:19.131 --> 38:23.795
I don't know what you're up to, but you
found something valuable in those caves...

38:23.969 --> 38:27.063
...and whatever it is, I'll find it.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.027
Lana.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.436
I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am about Kyla.

39:34.506 --> 39:37.373
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance
to know her better.

39:38.010 --> 39:39.910
You had a lot in common.

39:41.113 --> 39:45.550
That means a lot, knowing
how important she was to you.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.457
Kyla told me there used to be a star...

39:53.625 --> 39:56.321
...right out there with the bright one.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.259
But it disappeared.

40:02.234 --> 40:05.692
It's amazing how quickly
a light can go out.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.537
Lana, you're shaking. Are you okay?

40:19.918 --> 40:22.580
No. No, I don't think so.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.923
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

40:30.129 --> 40:31.960
Lana.

40:32.564 --> 40:37.001
Whitney's mom just called.
He's missing in action.

40:38.305 --> 40:44.339
