00:01.566 --> 00:03.177
Previously onCharmed...

00:03.220 --> 00:04.917
MAGGIE:
You really think your
dad did this to you?

00:04.961 --> 00:06.789
It's a demonic infection,
and only he can cure it.

00:06.832 --> 00:10.314
You remember... Fiona?

00:10.358 --> 00:11.402
The charge I lost.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.969
Losing her made me who I am.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.492
I suppose that's why

00:14.536 --> 00:16.799
I was given the honor
of serving alongside you three.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.496
Charity killed our mother.

00:22.457 --> 00:25.025
You haven't changed.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.549
Fiona.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.985
You're alive?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.622
WOMAN:
Okay, okay, okay, I'm coming.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.585
Help me.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.730
Harry Greenwood.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.037
Yes?You are charged

01:21.081 --> 01:22.908
with having
an unsanctioned relationship

01:22.952 --> 01:25.389
with Elder Callahan,
and reckless endangerment

01:25.433 --> 01:26.651
of the Charmed Ones.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.436
Can you defend
what you've done?

01:28.479 --> 01:33.528
Serving the Charmed Ones
is my greatest honor.

01:33.571 --> 01:36.444
It was never my intention
to fail them in any way.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.497
WOMAN:
He must be punished.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.283
Due to the serious
breach of trust

01:49.326 --> 01:51.763
that led to your impaired
judgment, Mr. Greenwood,

01:51.807 --> 01:54.157
we simply cannot let you
continue as a Whitelighter.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.684
The rules exist for good reason,
Mr. Greenwood.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.165
Charity Callahan has been
banished to Tartarus.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.036
And you, too,
must face consequences.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.604
By vote of the Elder Council...

02:06.648 --> 02:08.215
Ita factum est.

02:08.258 --> 02:13.394
Ita factum est.
Ita factum est.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.091
We hereby strip you
of your powers.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.093
Wait, I beg you.
The sisters are my...

02:54.261 --> 02:56.437
MAGGIE: I really hope
Harry's okay, you guys.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.527
Every bite of dry cereal is
a reminder that he's just...

02:59.570 --> 03:01.268
gone.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.095
Maggie, he's not gone.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.706
He just warned us that we might

03:04.749 --> 03:06.403
not hear from him
for a few days.

03:06.447 --> 03:12.366
Now, I know I'm no Harry,
but... these are his recipe.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.932
Thanks.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.021
I mean, even the Elders have
to realize that what Charity did

03:16.065 --> 03:17.414
is not Harry's fault.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.807
I mean, she was
right under our noses,

03:18.850 --> 03:20.330
and we didn't see
she was Mom's killer.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.985
Yeah, but we weren't doing
it like she and Harry were.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.117
Sorry, I mean,

03:25.161 --> 03:27.903
at least you knew
not to trust her.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.035
We were the ones who kept
telling you to ease up.

03:30.079 --> 03:30.949
I know,

03:30.993 --> 03:33.561
I just wish we could help him.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.171
The Elders
and their whole

03:35.215 --> 03:38.348
"don't call us, we'll call you"
thing is totally messed up.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.567
Galvin?

03:39.610 --> 03:41.743
Still nothing.MAGGIE:
I'm sure whatever

03:41.786 --> 03:44.224
jungle pit or volcano he's in
just doesn't have cell service.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.227
Volcano? Maggie. That
is not helping my nerves.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.362
He just stopped
texting back so abruptly.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.364
Maybe his grandmother was right,
and his whole mission

03:54.408 --> 03:57.411
to save me from my demon side
was too dangerous.

03:57.454 --> 04:00.501
Well, no news
is usually good news.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.243
At least that's
what I'm hoping.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.853
Dr. Julia's supposed to tell me

04:04.896 --> 04:06.637
as soon as Parker's
out of quarantine.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
If he doesn't get
better soon...

04:08.291 --> 04:12.469
No, you know what? I am
manifesting positivity.

04:12.513 --> 04:16.038
Parker will be saved,
and so will Galvin.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.262
MEL:
Hmm, that's weird.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.221
It's Niko,
wondering if we can talk.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.049
I don't know...You're supposed

04:27.092 --> 04:28.442
to let her go.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.182
Mel.
Come on.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.445
Niko's engaged.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.882
And she knows
I'm with Jada.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.840
But she's also
investigating the Sarcana,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.059
so if she's digging
into something,

04:37.102 --> 04:38.321
it's better if
I know about it.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.975
Mm-hmm.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.759
The plot thickens.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.326
There is no plot.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
Well, then, why were you
thinking about her

04:44.893 --> 04:46.155
having the softest lips
you've ever...

04:46.198 --> 04:47.461
Boundaries.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.724
Come on.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.209
Hi, you must be Mel.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.211
Greta.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.213
Nice to meet you.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.172
I've heard so much about you.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.827
Same.
They're back here.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.525
Niko's hoping you can shed
some light on the situation.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.614
Okay.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.879
This is Scarlet.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.794
Mel, thanks
for coming.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.057
Scarlet, can you tell Mel
what you told us?

05:19.101 --> 05:21.712
Um, it's all such a blur.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.627
I remember woods.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.327
The color blue.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.893
Women.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.331
We all didn't want to be there,

05:31.374 --> 05:33.768
but we all didn't
want to leave.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.336
The word "surrender."

05:36.379 --> 05:38.729
MAN:
Surrender.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.514
SCARLET:
The last thing I remember

05:40.557 --> 05:42.124
from the real world

05:42.167 --> 05:44.953
was reading some sappy poetry

05:44.996 --> 05:50.088
at the student union about me
and my boyfriend breaking up.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.134
I couldn't stop crying.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.135
MAN:
Surrender.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.832
Niko and I

05:54.876 --> 05:59.402
pieced it together and
that happened over a month ago.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.580
I can't believe
I lost a whole month.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.582
NIKO:
Don't worry.

06:05.626 --> 06:08.193
The memories will come,
or they won't.

06:08.237 --> 06:11.022
We're here to help you
either way.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.068
Okay?

06:16.071 --> 06:17.768
Okay, why don't
you go lie down?

06:31.129 --> 06:33.958
I saw Scarlet
at the grocery store

06:34.002 --> 06:35.438
last week with a
group of other women.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.267
They were all glassy-eyed,
like they'd been drugged.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.183
Though Scarlet seemed less
out of it than the rest.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.445
She's a long distance runner,

06:42.489 --> 06:45.840
so maybe she metabolized
the drugs faster?

06:45.883 --> 06:47.711
Anyway, I gave
'em my card.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.104
Didn't hear for a couple days.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.801
I checked in on the boyfriend,

06:50.845 --> 06:52.629
but they broke up
because he moved to Wisconsin

06:52.673 --> 06:55.458
and his alibi
checks out.

06:55.502 --> 06:59.070
I feel for her,
but, I'm sorry, why am I here?

06:59.114 --> 07:01.551
I'm wondering
if the cult she escaped from

07:01.595 --> 07:03.379
is affiliated with the Sarcana.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.729
The Sarcana are not a cult.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.470
Yeah, so you said,
but you haven't explained

07:07.514 --> 07:08.515
exactly what it is.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.518
We're a women's
empowerment group.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.216
And we don't want anybody
who doesn't want to be there.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.783
That mark on Scarlet's hand,

07:15.826 --> 07:18.394
it looks like an "S,"
wouldn't you say?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.309
I'm making Earl Grey.
Anyone want some?

07:20.352 --> 07:21.745
Sure, thanks, honey.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.094
You hate Earl Grey.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.792
What?

07:24.835 --> 07:26.271
You know what?

07:26.315 --> 07:28.448
Never mind, I got to go.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.146
I'm sorry I can't help you.

07:39.850 --> 07:43.332
Goddess Roxy, join me.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.203
Scarlet was your
friend, was she not?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.379
Mm-hmm.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.390
How many people do I need
for my ceremony tomorrow?

07:58.434 --> 08:01.132
Ten goddess prefects
to serve Viralis,

08:01.176 --> 08:03.918
so that he may be
forever blessed.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.357
Where is Scarlet, Roxy?

08:08.400 --> 08:11.403
I, I don't know.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.275
Where is she?!

08:13.318 --> 08:16.670
Where am I?
What is this? No!

08:16.713 --> 08:17.932
No, I don't want that!

08:17.975 --> 08:20.543
What are we doing here?
Run!

08:25.374 --> 08:26.941
Stupid girl!

08:26.984 --> 08:28.943
Now I need another one!

08:28.986 --> 08:30.945
Why was Roxy punished?!

08:30.988 --> 08:32.773
WOMEN:
She's a traitor.

08:32.816 --> 08:36.254
Traitor. Traitor. Traitor.

08:36.298 --> 08:40.563
Traitor. Traitor.
Traitor. Traitor. Traitor.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.392
Traitor. Traitor. Traitor.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.960
Traitor.
Traitor. Traitor.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.397
Bring me my Goddess Scarlet!

08:49.441 --> 08:51.400
Kill whoever stands in your way.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.445
Go!

09:00.452 --> 09:03.630
I don't understand.
If I wear gloves and a mask

09:03.673 --> 09:05.153
or something,
why can't I see him?

09:05.196 --> 09:07.416
When Parker had this before,

09:07.459 --> 09:10.332
he lost control during a seizure
and nearly killed me.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.901
That's when Alistair finally
convinced me to allow Parker

09:13.944 --> 09:16.164
to be injected with his blood.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.774
That's what saved him.

09:17.818 --> 09:21.604
I know, but Parker
won't go to Alistair.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.780
Mm-mm.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.782
No, the transfusion
of Alistair's blood

09:25.826 --> 09:28.393
is what activated
Parker's demon side.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.355
There's a reason why they warn
you about the bad boys.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.622
Did you know
he was a demon when you met?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.624
No.

09:41.668 --> 09:46.629
No. No, I thought he was
a charismatic millionaire

09:46.673 --> 09:49.806
and I was just a nerdy post-doc.

09:49.850 --> 09:53.636
Next thing I know, I was living
in a real-life Rosemary's Baby.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.641
What about Macy's blood?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.208
No, it has to be full demon.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.905
So, if I get
another demon's blood,

10:01.949 --> 10:04.038
would that cure
Parker's infection?

10:04.081 --> 10:07.824
There are a whole lot
of unknowns.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.826
And it would wipe out
any progress we've made

10:09.870 --> 10:11.654
building up Parker's human side.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.961
But once the infection is gone,
you can use your serum

10:14.004 --> 10:15.658
to bring back
his human side, right?

10:15.702 --> 10:16.833
Theoretically, yes.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.709
I got to go.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.845
Anyone seen any demons?
Turns out, I need one

10:28.889 --> 10:31.413
to save Parker's life.

10:31.456 --> 10:34.895
You two look like
you've seen a ghost.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.903
Hello, Maggie.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.996
Harry?

10:49.039 --> 10:50.780
Harry, no! What happened?

10:50.824 --> 10:52.826
♪ Hold on...♪

10:52.869 --> 10:55.480
I've been stripped of my powers.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.529
My body is in the process
of deteriorating

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
to what would be its human age.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.274
Ninety-eight.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.145
♪ Hold on...♪

11:08.189 --> 11:11.105
And given the average
life expectancy, I-I'm...

11:11.148 --> 11:12.715
I'm afraid...

11:12.759 --> 11:14.195
Oh, Maggie.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.894
Oh... please.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.854
No. I haven't gone yet.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.333
I may not have
my powers,

11:22.377 --> 11:26.381
but I do have permission
to offer you ladies advice until

11:26.424 --> 11:28.688
a new Whitelighter
is found.A new Whitelighter?

11:28.731 --> 11:32.213
We don't want a new
Whitelighter. We want you.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.171
Well, I know I've lived
a long life

11:34.215 --> 11:36.913
when Melanie Vera
is clamoring for my counsel.

11:36.957 --> 11:40.221
Don't joke, Harry.
This is serious.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.223
There must be
something we can do.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.746
Find acceptance.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.487
Not our strong suit.

11:45.530 --> 11:49.709
My clouded judgment compromised
your lives and your mission.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.669
Listen to me.

11:55.410 --> 11:59.675
You three are my legacy.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.506
And I couldn't be prouder.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.902
I am at peace knowing
you will not falter

12:08.945 --> 12:10.991
in your mission to fight evil.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.647
And, Mel,

12:15.691 --> 12:18.781
if, uh, your path were
to cross with Fiona...

12:20.957 --> 12:23.307
I'd like to see her

12:23.351 --> 12:25.005
before, uh...

12:25.048 --> 12:27.747
Now I'm off to rest.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.270
If you need me,
I'll offer what I can

12:29.313 --> 12:32.360
in the time I have left.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.464
He was wearing

12:49.507 --> 12:52.772
his old man lapel pin.

12:52.815 --> 12:57.124
Pretty sure he once told me
he wanted to be buried in that.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.908
What are we gonna do?

13:02.303 --> 13:04.305
We don't surrender.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.759
NIKO:
Scarlet!

13:23.803 --> 13:24.934
Are you okay?

13:27.763 --> 13:29.547
Who are you?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.650
Hey, glad
you're here.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.435
It's happening today.

13:47.478 --> 13:50.090
We're preparing the Keeper
to take on her new powers.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.310
The Keeper?
You mean Fiona.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.878
Once she activates,
we take over.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.793
We control magic,
not the Elders.

13:57.837 --> 14:02.232
What does that
mean, exactly?

14:02.276 --> 14:05.670
Put it this way--
the Elders think inside the box,

14:05.714 --> 14:08.673
we want to blow up the box.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.285
Well, then this might be
right up your alley.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.679
The Elders took away
Harry's powers. He's dying.

14:14.723 --> 14:18.248
Wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.555
He asked to see Fiona.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.820
We need to keep her
focused right now.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.778
Tell her that
it might be now or never.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.741
Can the Sarcana help,
like you did before,

14:32.784 --> 14:34.264
to break him out of Tartarus?

14:34.308 --> 14:37.093
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing we can do.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.052
You're half-Whitelighter.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.923
You might have
some way.

14:40.967 --> 14:45.232
I don't, and asking me to help
an Elder patsy is a tough sell.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.755
Don't call him that.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.235
He is my friend.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.845
The Keeper is my only
priority right now.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.674
I am asking you
to do this for me.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.155
I can't help you, Mel.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.592
It doesn't matter how we feel
about each other.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.683
There's a war brewing,
sides are being drawn.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.903
You're supposed to understand,
you're one of us.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.776
Maybe I'm not...

15:07.819 --> 15:09.038
one of you.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.128
And maybe this
isn't what

15:12.172 --> 15:13.695
I thought it was.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.225
FIONA:
Everything okay?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.404
Did you hear that?

15:27.448 --> 15:29.450
I heard enough.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.019
You were right to refuse her.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.151
He may have been
my Whitelighter once,

15:35.195 --> 15:38.894
but anyone that... cozy

15:38.938 --> 15:41.941
with my sister
is not worth saving.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.294
So, wait, I'm confused.
Did you break up?

15:47.337 --> 15:48.904
Pretty much.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.601
Hmm. Why do I
get the feeling

15:50.645 --> 15:52.690
we're not here
for comfort cocktails?

15:52.734 --> 15:56.346
If we can't reach the Elders,
I'll make them reach us.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.131
I'm sure with Harry
incapacitated,

15:58.174 --> 16:01.177
they're surveilling us somehow.
We'll force their hand.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.397
By doing what?

16:03.440 --> 16:04.572
Magic.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.704
Here? I can't have
these people knowing

16:06.748 --> 16:08.054
I can move crap
with my mind.

16:08.097 --> 16:11.100
Trust me, the Elders
won't let it go that far.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.669
Oh.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.019
Hello.

16:17.063 --> 16:20.762
So, uh, which one of you
is coming home with me tonight?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.678
Want to see a magic trick?

16:23.721 --> 16:25.419
Yeah, I do.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.733
Are we seriously doing this?This is so dangerous, Mel.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.084
Yeah, it is.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.962
How dare you flaunt
your magic to the public.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.051
How dare you not give
the Charmed Ones

16:49.095 --> 16:51.488
an open line of communication.

16:55.101 --> 16:59.105
We demand you reinstate
Harry Greenwood's powers.

16:59.148 --> 17:03.587
He had nothing to do with what
Charity-- Elder Callahan did.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.503
And we need him.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.811
Perhaps it is unclear
who makes the rules.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.552
MEL:
More like it doesn't make sense

17:11.595 --> 17:13.336
who makes the rules.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.686
We're supposed to be the most
powerful witches on earth.

17:15.730 --> 17:16.687
And you could be,

17:16.731 --> 17:18.907
if you would listen and learn.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.302
You see us as tools to use,

17:22.345 --> 17:23.868
but guess what?

17:23.912 --> 17:27.959
Charity duped you, too.
Where's your culpability?

17:29.961 --> 17:34.009
We are the Charmed Ones.
Who the hell are you?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
Harry knowingly broke the rules

17:36.098 --> 17:38.883
and has accepted
the consequences.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.103
Follow his example.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.804
What was that place?

17:46.848 --> 17:48.937
That was like...Whoa.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.983
Mel, you were awesome.But it didn't work.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.029
What are we going to do?

17:56.292 --> 17:57.511
MEL:
What happened?

17:57.554 --> 17:59.904
Four of them took Scarlet.
They had these

17:59.948 --> 18:01.558
animalistic
blue eyes.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.995
Maybe from whatever
drugs they were on?

18:04.039 --> 18:05.084
I don't think so.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.043
Up close, they were,
like, glowing,

18:08.087 --> 18:09.958
and I could've sworn
Scarlet was levitating.

18:10.001 --> 18:13.701
Wow. I mean, that sounds...Crazy.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.486
I know.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.054
Crazy like that warehouse
a few weeks ago

18:19.098 --> 18:20.534
when we showed up
to take the Finches down,

18:20.577 --> 18:22.710
but they were already tied up
and ready to confess.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.060
That was just really lucky.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.888
Yeah, unbelievably lucky.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.846
Inexplicably.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.936
Don't look at me. I'm the last
person who can explain this.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.112
Uh-huh.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.506
Are you absolutely
certain the Sarcana

18:36.550 --> 18:38.073
aren't involved in this?

18:38.117 --> 18:42.904
I've only been in the Sarcana
for a few months.

18:42.947 --> 18:46.690
There's a lot I don't know,
but I'll look into it.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.697
MACY: Okay, cross-referencing
glowing-eyed minions

18:53.741 --> 18:56.091
and that S symbol
on their palms, I give you

18:56.135 --> 18:58.528
Viralis, a soul-sucking
virility demon.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.748
He looks into your soul,
sees your deepest desire,

19:00.791 --> 19:03.751
and promises it to you
in exchange for total surrender.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.753
So cult leader
makes sense,

19:05.796 --> 19:08.408
and Scarlet mentioned
the word "surrender."

19:08.451 --> 19:11.019
Hmm...
He keeps his victims

19:11.062 --> 19:14.979
docile by feeding them his demon
blood, a blue sap-like nectar.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.112
Every ten years,
at the spring equinox...

19:17.156 --> 19:18.940
Spring?
It's freaking freezing.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.202
Welcome to Michigan
in March.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
Climate change is real, people.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.163
Anyway, in a ritual ceremony,

19:24.206 --> 19:27.166
Viralis sacrifices ten women

19:27.209 --> 19:30.647
using a-- ooh--
very phallic-looking dagger

19:30.691 --> 19:33.868
to maintain his virility and
his life for another ten years.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.523
Ew. He's using these women
as demonic Viagra.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.394
MACY: In order
to vanquish Viralis,

19:38.438 --> 19:40.788
he has to be killed
at the source of his power

19:40.831 --> 19:43.704
using-- and again, I repeat--
his very phallic-looking knife.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.358
Sorry, this is just,
this is really hard to,

19:45.401 --> 19:48.491
uh, to focus on some random
demon when Harry is dying.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.456
MAGGIE:
Look,

19:56.499 --> 19:59.502
the last thing Harry wants
is for us to let innocents die,

19:59.546 --> 20:02.418
and vanquishing this demon

20:02.462 --> 20:03.637
could save Parker.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.378
I need demon blood and this

20:05.421 --> 20:07.858
Freudian nightmare
of a bro demon has it.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.817
W-Why don't I just give
Parker my blood?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.732
It has to be a full demon,
but thanks.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.909
Too demon for some,
not enough for others.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.258
All right, well,

20:16.302 --> 20:18.129
if we're doing it,
we have to do it now.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.044
The vernal equinox is today.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.223
Where are we gonna find Viralis?

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
I might know where he hunts
for vulnerable women.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.922
The last thing Scarlet remembers

20:27.965 --> 20:30.098
is performing poetry
at the student union.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.840
That pretentious poetry thing
the Humanities Department does?

20:32.883 --> 20:34.668
Mm-hmm.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.278
Where I will totally
be performing

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
a super pretentious poem.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.545
I'll go as bait.
He targets human women, right?

20:42.589 --> 20:44.330
Witches are probably
immune to his tricks.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.897
I'll read his mind
and do what he wants me to do,

20:46.941 --> 20:49.509
and...  he'll lead us
to the other women.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.119
Don't think you
getting kidnapped

20:51.162 --> 20:52.990
is the solution to our problem.

20:53.034 --> 20:53.904
Duh.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.604
That compass Charity
used on you, Macy.

20:57.647 --> 21:01.695
Harry took it,
and a receiver ring from her.

21:01.738 --> 21:02.913
I'll wear the ring.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.045
You guys can use the compass
to track me,

21:04.088 --> 21:05.568
and then swoop in
and take him down.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.309
And I'll help free
the other women,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.311
get the demon blood for Parker.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.272
What could possibly go wrong?

21:16.884 --> 21:20.235
"What we think we have
is not ours.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.587
"The blood courses.
Then runs its course.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.720
"You're lost in the shadow.

21:26.763 --> 21:30.376
"And your White Light dims.

21:30.419 --> 21:33.204
"And I am left
holding nothing

21:33.248 --> 21:35.424
"that used to
be something.

21:35.468 --> 21:36.991
Once upon a time."

21:37.034 --> 21:38.862
Thank you.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.184
"We are,

21:56.227 --> 21:58.186
"all of us, nothing more

21:58.229 --> 22:00.057
"than briefly animated meat,

22:00.101 --> 22:03.365
"stalking ourselves in
the barest of feet.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.627
There is nothing more..."

22:04.671 --> 22:07.326
That was amazing.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.416
Uh, thank you.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.636
I'm V.

22:15.682 --> 22:16.987
Are you okay?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.293
I bet that's him.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.383
Just a little sad.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.429
Do you need to
talk about it?

22:26.780 --> 22:29.130
Come on.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.837
You really were
so great up there.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.580
You have so
much heart.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.669
I feel like I already
know you from your poem.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.802
I see you.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.153
And your pain.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.725
May I tell you
your greatest desire?

23:10.127 --> 23:11.781
A love that never leaves.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.138
Look at me, Goddess.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.749
Listen to me.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.186
I am a love that
will never leave you.

23:31.366 --> 23:34.543
I will be with you
until the day that you die.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.806
Thank you.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.157
Let it all go.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.159
Surrender.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.998
I don't understand.
They were here, and
then they weren't.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.957
Where did they go?Somewhere where
they can't be tracked.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.958
He must have
blocked the tracker.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.394
Harry?

23:59.438 --> 24:02.092
What?Harry!

24:02.136 --> 24:03.050
You can orb again?

24:03.093 --> 24:04.617
Uh, no. No, no.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.054
I was worried
about you.

24:07.097 --> 24:10.057
So I, uh, well, I followed you.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.060
In the way
a normal person would.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.365
Uh, well, a normal stalker.

24:16.324 --> 24:20.154
Uh, actually I thought you were
just having a sisterly coffee,

24:20.197 --> 24:21.503
so I took a nap.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.984
Aging is exhausting.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.376
So, what seems
to be the problem?

24:25.420 --> 24:26.943
Maggie's been kidnapped
by a soul-sucking

24:26.987 --> 24:28.075
cult leader demon who's

24:28.118 --> 24:28.771
turned off our ability
to track her.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.079
Oh. Oh...

24:32.122 --> 24:35.561
Where-- oh. My eyes aren't
what they were a few days ago.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.523
Ah... Oh.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.308
A simple spell
will restore this.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.876
Refricietur quod fractum erat.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.575
MEL/MACY:
Refricietur quod fractum erat.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.839
HARRY:
There.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.057
Wait, we can just bypass

24:54.101 --> 24:56.059
a demon's mystical
security system?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.844
You are the Charmed Ones.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.062
There's a lot you can do.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.282
Harry.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.632
I still have some
friends on the inside.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.330
They said you were fierce
in championing me.
Yeah.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.115
Thank you, Mel.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.420
We really tried.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.161
And we won't give up.I know.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.207
Now, off you go.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.556
You're not coming with us?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.298
Uh, at this point,
I could be a liability.

25:18.734 --> 25:19.822
Fine. I'll drive.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.737
Great.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.566
Wait, uh...That's right.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
Yes.

25:26.046 --> 25:29.615
I'm sorry. Stairs.

26:01.647 --> 26:05.694
Only through surrender...WOMEN: Can we all be free.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.872
Goddesses.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.962
In your sacred spot
of surrender, you will find

26:13.006 --> 26:15.878
your very own dagger of freedom.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.289
I will never
leave you.

26:38.945 --> 26:43.210
As our sun moves across
the celestial equator,

26:43.253 --> 26:46.996
we celebrate the ripening
of man.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.519
The virility.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.305
WOMEN:
Zara gu ban-ngar.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.220
You will shed your
flesh vehicles

26:53.263 --> 26:55.918
so that I may continue
my blessed work.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.368
Goddess Wendy...

27:11.412 --> 27:14.807
are you ready to surrender
yourself to me?

27:14.850 --> 27:16.678
I am.

27:16.722 --> 27:20.639
Viralis-ra nam-til ud sudra
sangesh riganib.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.423
Zara gu ban-ngar!

27:38.439 --> 27:40.049
Who's next?WOMAN: Pick me!

27:51.887 --> 27:53.454
MACY:
This must be it.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.109
The important thing is
to remain unnoticed until...

27:57.850 --> 27:59.112
Niko?!

28:02.332 --> 28:03.203
What are you doing here?

28:03.246 --> 28:04.117
What are youdoing here?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.162
I, uh...Our sister is missing,

28:06.206 --> 28:07.990
and we, we tracked
the GPS on her phone.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.165
Oh, God.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.732
Mel, do you know what
this place is?

28:10.776 --> 28:13.430
Uh...It's the cult that took Scarlet.

28:13.474 --> 28:17.304
No!I saw their van on a neighbor's
surveillance camera

28:17.347 --> 28:20.611
and pulled a partial plate;
it's registered to this address.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.178
I'm so sorry.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.397
But I promise you, Mel,

28:23.440 --> 28:24.833
I will get your sister
out of there.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.712
Mel?

28:36.192 --> 28:37.280
Harry.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.240
He's human now.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.119
VIRALIS:
What's happening?

28:59.912 --> 29:01.174
You!

29:02.697 --> 29:05.352
This disturbance has
something to do with you.

29:14.361 --> 29:18.147
If anybody comes
through that door...

29:18.191 --> 29:19.670
kill them.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.238
Anything for you, Master.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.190
Where are you, creep-o?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.077
Ow, Maggie!

30:42.318 --> 30:43.885
Well, this makes things easier.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.156
Ah!

30:54.200 --> 30:55.854
Without your powers, I can't...

31:06.865 --> 31:08.867
You couldn't just stay
under the radar, huh?

31:12.131 --> 31:14.568
Mark my words...

31:14.611 --> 31:18.267
I will get into that mind
of yours before you die.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.346
Oh...

31:53.389 --> 31:55.348
Maggie, it's me, your sister.
Please don't do this.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.613
Okay, fine, the
gloves are off.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.354
What about Parker, huh?

32:01.397 --> 32:03.617
Remember him?
Parker?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.010
Who will die
and leave me?

32:05.053 --> 32:06.228
I'm with Viralis now.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.882
He'll love me until
the day I die.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.895
He gives me everything
Parker and Harry can't.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.201
A love that never leaves!

32:23.898 --> 32:25.334
MACY:
Maggie, Mel.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.945
I got this,
go get him!

32:41.394 --> 32:44.919
MEL :
Stop it! Get off!

33:03.111 --> 33:06.854
Maggie, you're choking me!

33:06.897 --> 33:08.464
Macy, help!

33:08.508 --> 33:11.337
Yeah, trying!

33:25.916 --> 33:27.788
Damn it!

33:30.617 --> 33:32.010
Uh...

33:56.338 --> 33:58.514
Oh, my God.

33:58.558 --> 33:59.907
Mel?

34:01.909 --> 34:04.825
What... what am I doing?

34:04.868 --> 34:07.175
Why are we in a barn?

34:09.221 --> 34:11.527
Oh, please get me out of here.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.312
Actually,
I need you to stay here

34:13.355 --> 34:16.054
for a few more minutes, okay?

34:19.187 --> 34:21.842
You were a little
to the left.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.068
Okay, come on, and if
anything happens in there...

34:31.634 --> 34:33.375
Is that...?

34:33.419 --> 34:35.812
Is what?

34:35.856 --> 34:37.379
Nothing. Let's go.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.953
Did you freeze time?

34:45.996 --> 34:48.434
Shh. Come on, old man.

34:48.477 --> 34:49.652
Ah...

34:52.655 --> 34:54.309
Scarlet.

34:54.353 --> 34:57.138
Niko. I'm so glad you're here...

34:57.182 --> 34:59.836
Maggie.Harry.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.838
Thank you so much
for coming.

35:02.491 --> 35:05.320
I wish
I could heal you.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.670
Me, too.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.368
Hey.
Hey.

35:09.411 --> 35:12.632
Managed to get my hands on
some of Viralis's demon blood.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.329
It's all yours.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.375
That's gonna help them.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.991
Our cult leader seems
to have vanished.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.035
Hmm.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.863
Something weird's
going on here.

35:26.907 --> 35:29.039
You always seem to be
right at the center of it.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.913
You should put
some cream on that.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.871
You wouldn't
want it to scar.

35:52.672 --> 35:53.803
Hi.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.414
Did it work?

35:55.457 --> 35:58.156
Please tell me I joined
a demon cult and I won?

35:59.722 --> 36:01.071
Oh, no.No, no.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.073
No, no, it-it seems
to be working.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.250
So can I see him?No.

36:05.293 --> 36:06.903
I was able
to administer

36:06.947 --> 36:09.515
the first dose, but that means
that he has demon blood coursing

36:09.558 --> 36:11.169
through his veins.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.040
I'm gonna give him
the second dose tonight.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.739
♪ A place it all begins

36:16.783 --> 36:19.046
♪ A chain reaction...

36:19.089 --> 36:21.222
This is where it gets worse
before it gets better.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.747
I will call you as soon
as he's well enough, I promise.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.228
Okay.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.491
♪ We must be strong

36:32.015 --> 36:35.280
♪ It's only just begun

36:38.935 --> 36:41.634
♪ It's not over yet

36:41.677 --> 36:44.506
♪ This battle's only begun

36:50.251 --> 36:52.906
♪ Now that we've
pulled the thread ♪

36:52.949 --> 36:55.517
♪ What's coming
can't be undone ♪

37:01.480 --> 37:03.569
♪ It's not over yet.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.277
I mean, I had my hands
around Mel's throat.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.367
She was coming at me
with this crazy force.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.847
And then Macy
swooped in

37:20.890 --> 37:22.283
with the final save.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.851
I guess I did do
the swooping this time.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.332
Well, it sounds like

37:27.375 --> 37:31.292
you all worked
beautifully together.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.602
And, Maggie, I know
it's not the same, but...

37:36.645 --> 37:39.257
we are a love that
will never leave you.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.352
Oh, I can,
I can take that.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.616
Oh...

37:51.878 --> 37:54.315
Uh, do you-you
want a snack?

37:54.359 --> 37:55.925
No, no, no.

37:57.362 --> 38:00.408
Tuck you in.Thank you.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.764
I want to save Harry's life.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.551
You came.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.727
And why would you
want to do that?

38:14.770 --> 38:17.599
Because I want the Charmed Ones
to be in my debt.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.254
And what about
the Sarcana?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.516
FIONA:
Who cares?

38:21.560 --> 38:25.215
This is my choice.What are you doing here?

38:27.217 --> 38:29.219
She's saving Harry's life.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.314
Fiona, there's
way too much

38:36.357 --> 38:37.837
at stake for you to risk your
power on a dying Whitelighter.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.229
That dying Whitelighter's
more important

38:39.273 --> 38:41.231
than you could
possibly understand.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.929
Understand me, Jada,

38:42.972 --> 38:44.452
do you know what
I could do to you?

38:44.496 --> 38:46.280
You'll find two of your
Sarcana friends under my bed.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.543
If you're fast, they
might still be alive.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.029
Is that a yes?

39:04.864 --> 39:06.169
Yes.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.781
I'll bring him back
when he's well.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.870
I don't know when that will be.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.323
Melanie.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.869
There's so much

39:53.913 --> 39:56.350
I want to say.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.355
I'm so sorry, Fiona.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.377
Oh...

40:23.421 --> 40:25.248
Harry...

40:28.338 --> 40:30.471
I'm sorry, too.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.214
That which is hidden,
reveal itself.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.389
That which is
hidden, reveal itself.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.000
That which is hidden,
reveal itself.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.046
Oh, there you are.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.823
I guess you're
coming with me.
