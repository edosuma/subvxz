00:01.784 --> 00:03.960
Previously onScorpion...CABE: A great fella like you

00:04.004 --> 00:06.180
can meet two special women
in one lifetime.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.485
You worry too much.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.009
So did I.
Maybe that's why

00:09.052 --> 00:10.140
the pregnancy didn't take.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.924
WALTER:
Paige, uh, bad news.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.187
The lecture was canceled.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.841
It's probably for the best.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.366
I'm glad you could make it.I'm psyched.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.324
Is there something
that you want to say?

00:20.368 --> 00:23.023
I-I'd never told you that
you're the love of my life.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.720
Y-You told me you
love me before.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.026
Wanted you to know.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.030
Okay.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.642
What are you lying about?

00:34.686 --> 00:37.124
I really don't want to do this.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.342
Shut up and
drop your pants.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.346
Never thought I'd be unhappy
to hear you say those words.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.349
Palms down,
stick out that rump.

00:45.393 --> 00:49.049
Hey, gang, I brought bagels.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.007
I don't even want to know.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.182
Relax.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.141
He's just getting a shot.[yelps]

00:54.184 --> 00:56.273
Oh, please. Woman up.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.580
I thought Happy was getting
the shots for IVF.

00:58.623 --> 00:59.842
She is.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.278
But since she hates blood
and getting needles,

01:01.322 --> 01:02.279
we made a deal.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.846
For every shot I get,

01:03.889 --> 01:05.456
he gets a saline goose
in the keister.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.198
It's forced solidarity,
but solidarity nonetheless.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
CABE:
Strange, but...

01:09.678 --> 01:11.375
all right.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.073
Good morning, Cabe.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.640
Only since Doc
pulled his pants up.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.123
[softly]: Oh. Just the people
I wanted to see.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.169
Do either of you have
connections at Cal Polytechnic?

01:22.212 --> 01:23.648
No. Why are you whispering?

01:23.692 --> 01:25.172
I don't want Walter
to hear me.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.216
Remember that lecture he and I
were supposed to go to

01:26.260 --> 01:27.261
but it got canceled?

01:29.219 --> 01:31.134
The speaker is gonna be
at Cal Polytechnic next month,

01:31.178 --> 01:32.266
but it's sold out.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.181
Bummer.
I know.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.183
It's just... well, I sort of
feel like there's something

01:36.226 --> 01:38.141
that Walter wants to tell me
but my instincts are screaming

01:38.185 --> 01:39.534
that he's withholding.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.102
Really? I-I haven't picked
up anything from him.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.365
PAIGE:
Huh. It's weird,

01:44.408 --> 01:47.194
'cause my EQ radar is pinging
all over the place,

01:47.237 --> 01:49.370
and we just had such
stressful cases lately,

01:49.413 --> 01:51.241
and he's been working nonstop
on that Gettleman pitch,

01:51.285 --> 01:53.330
and I just thought if I could
take him to the lecture,

01:53.374 --> 01:55.071
we'd have a nice night together,
he'd relax,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.203
and maybe want to open up to me

01:56.246 --> 01:58.118
and let me know
what's been on his mind.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.510
I don't know,
but maybe I'm being crazy.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.511
Am I being crazy?

02:00.555 --> 02:01.817
Yeah.
Yes.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.167
[clicks tongue]
Okay, well, either way,

02:04.211 --> 02:05.734
don't tell him that I'm trying
to get him tickets

02:05.777 --> 02:06.952
because I want it
to be a surprise.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.824
Won't say a thing.Scout's honor.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.260
She's getting you
lecture tickets.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.654
I fail to see the problem.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.090
The longer she keeps her head
in lecture land,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.048
the more likely it is
she's gonna find out

02:16.092 --> 02:17.224
that you already went
to it with Flo.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.269
We've established
that was innocent.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.013
What was that for?Jerks don't get coffee.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.754
Childish.
TOBY:
No, Walt.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.538
You're the child
if you fail to see

02:27.582 --> 02:29.105
that there is an
inverse relationship

02:29.149 --> 02:30.411
between time and innocence.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.196
If I kept a box hidden
from you for a long time,

02:33.240 --> 02:34.850
w-when you finally opened it,

02:34.893 --> 02:36.765
wouldn't matter if there was
just an innocent pebble inside.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.115
The fact that I obscured it
from you for so long

02:39.159 --> 02:40.334
makes it suspicious.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.292
Now imagine
instead of a pebble,

02:42.336 --> 02:45.165
it's the cute scientist
next door that you have

02:45.208 --> 02:46.296
kissy dreams about.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.819
You said that dream
didn't matter.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.170
Oh, come on.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.997
HAPPY:
Listen, I have waited

02:52.041 --> 02:54.739
for a family my whole life
and Scorpion is it.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.089
And I am about to turn my ass
into a pin cushion

02:57.133 --> 02:58.221
so I can have more family.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.223
I am not gonna let you
blow up our family

03:00.267 --> 03:01.311
'cause you're a knucklehead.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.008
Scorpion won't blow up.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.749
There's no reason why
Paige will find out.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.317
And if she did, I would
just tell her the truth.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.624
I didn't mention it to her

03:09.667 --> 03:10.886
because it's a
trivial matter.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.106
Instead of poking
into my business,

03:14.150 --> 03:16.674
you guys work on your end
of the Gettleman pitch.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.328
Need to land that contract.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.460
No more distractions.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.331
Guys, monitor tree.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.811
Stat!

03:22.854 --> 03:24.247
So much for no more
distractions.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.336
Can you...

03:26.380 --> 03:28.251
Sly, what's going on?

03:28.295 --> 03:32.037
My pen pal, Alex, just texted me
he is in trouble.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.257
It's life and death.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.780
Since when do you
have a pen pal?

03:35.824 --> 03:37.913
When I was a kid, I saw a
commercial for sending books

03:37.956 --> 03:39.349
to children in need in Africa.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.351
I was assigned Alemeyahu

03:41.395 --> 03:42.657
or Alex.
We've been friends since.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.355
Sylvester. Oh, thank goodness.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.792
Thank you for reaching out
to me.

03:47.836 --> 03:53.320
Oh, my. I must say, I am nervous
meeting the great Team Scorpion.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.147
Sylvester has told me
of your exploits.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.932
Uh, Alex, Sly said

03:56.975 --> 03:58.673
you're dealing with a life
and death situation.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.196
Yes. Behranu, our village elder,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.371
is quite ill.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.807
He's a widely revered leader.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.245
He's even respected
by the violent militants

04:05.288 --> 04:09.031
that have taken over
much of Murabi since 2014.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.599
The militants want to expand
into our territory,

04:11.642 --> 04:15.298
but they are willing to discuss
peace in deference to Behranu.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.387
They will only negotiate
with him.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.694
This would save
thousands of lives.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.565
Talks are far from complete,

04:21.609 --> 04:23.480
and Behranu's taken ill

04:23.524 --> 04:25.352
and fuel is running out.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.789
Don't you mean time
is running out?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.573
No. Behranu has heart failure.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.706
He's being kept alive
by a ventilator.

04:31.749 --> 04:35.492
The generator powering our
clinic is running out of fuel.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.146
And yesterday, mortar shells

04:37.189 --> 04:39.148
destroyed the only mountain road

04:39.191 --> 04:40.280
that leads to the fuel depot.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.412
And if the generator
runs out of fuel...

04:42.456 --> 04:43.979
Ventilator stops working.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.285
Behranu dies along
with any chance

04:45.328 --> 04:46.721
of finishing
those peace talks.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.505
And Alex's community
is decimated by militants.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.203
We only have 36 hours
of petrol left.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.205
Alex, I'm sorry,

04:53.249 --> 04:54.990
but we're not suited
to rebuild a mountain road.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.383
That is not what we need.

04:56.426 --> 05:00.474
Please, open the file
I just sent you.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.085
SYLVESTER:
Got it.

05:03.128 --> 05:06.393
That is a five-mile pass
that reaches the fuel depot,

05:06.436 --> 05:09.613
but it is full of buried
ordinance from the war of '88.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.355
And if not for the land mines,
that would be a perfect

05:12.399 --> 05:15.315
shortcut to the fuel depot.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.272
When I was a kid,
my pen pal wanted

05:16.316 --> 05:17.491
a postcard from Hollywood.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.970
Yours wants us
to clear a minefield?

05:19.014 --> 05:20.363
Maybe we don't
have to clear it.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.582
Maybe we just
have to map it.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.324
Now, over time, land
mines leak explosives

05:24.367 --> 05:25.455
into the soil,
so there must be a way

05:25.499 --> 05:27.283
to chemically ID the leaks.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.502
We have to get Florence
in on this.

05:28.545 --> 05:29.503
PAIGE:
Oh, she's still in Berlin.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.982
She's pitching her company

05:31.026 --> 05:32.332
to investors.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.376
So we won't use chemistry.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.856
Use biology.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.425
Uh, we can get engineered
saprotrophic soil bacterium

05:38.468 --> 05:39.643
from a college
research lab.

05:39.687 --> 05:40.731
What the hell is that?TOBY: It's a bacteria.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.385
Eats hydrocarbons.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.953
Use it to clean up oil spills,
but it also gobbles up toluene.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.824
And what the hell's that?It's the explosive

05:46.868 --> 05:48.435
that leaks from the land mines.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.350
We spray the ground
with bacteria,

05:50.393 --> 05:52.134
it ingests the toluene.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.267
And then the soil above the land
mine, it's gonna glow green.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.227
So we'll see where all the
things that go boom are buried.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.968
We drive around the mines
and we get the fuel for Alex.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.186
I will make a laser

06:01.230 --> 06:02.840
so we can see the bacteria
glow in the sun.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.494
Toby, give me a hand.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.843
I'll get us a plane.I'll grab the gear.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.410
I cannot thank you enough.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.107
We are on our way.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.239
WALTER:
Hey, Sly.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.936
Need your help
with the mapping software

06:11.980 --> 06:13.068
while we're on the plane.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.462
Sure.

06:15.505 --> 06:18.334
Um, Walter, I noticed

06:18.378 --> 06:19.509
that it was your
first instinct

06:19.553 --> 06:21.468
to include Florence
in this mission.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.644
Now, I was just wondering

06:23.687 --> 06:26.342
if there was any
possibility that...

06:26.386 --> 06:28.213
I told you at the softball game
and I'm telling you now,

06:28.257 --> 06:29.519
there is nothing going on.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.565
[scoffs]

06:34.829 --> 06:36.526
Worst drive ever.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.790
That road had more bumps than
a herd of pregnant camels.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.879
No wonder they can't transport
the elder.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.446
There's zero chance
he'd survive that.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.447
Sylvester, you are here.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.231
Alex.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.451
[laughs]

06:48.495 --> 06:51.454
And Team Scorpion in my village.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.455
Yeah. We can sign
autographs later.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.456
Clock's ticking.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.762
What's the generator status?

06:54.805 --> 06:57.025
Less than two hours
of fuel left.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.722
Which means your elder
and potential peace

06:58.766 --> 06:59.767
also have less than two hours.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.029
Uh, this is gonna be close.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.552
Did you get the trucks
I asked for?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.119
Secured. I apprentice
with a plumber,

07:04.162 --> 07:05.903
so I borrowed his pickup,
plus the fuel truck, of course.

07:05.947 --> 07:09.037
Okay. Let's load up
and head out.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.473
Wait!

07:10.517 --> 07:14.129
First we must get approval
from Behranu himself.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.828
Behranu must look into your eyes
to see your intention is pure.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.917
Then he will approbate
our endeavor.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.353
PAIGE:
All right, let's do it.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
Cabe, Toby, with me.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.269
We'll pay our respects

07:24.313 --> 07:27.011
while you three get the gear
on our trucks.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.798
Cala is an assistant
in the clinic.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.408
These are members
of Team Scorpion.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.541
Agent Gallo, Paige and Toby.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.672
You're Dr. Toby Curtis?

07:35.716 --> 07:37.021
Alex has told me
much about you.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.588
You hear that, Cabe?

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
I'm huge in Murabi.ALEX: This way.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.375
Behranu.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.248
These are the Americans
who have come to help us.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.516
He deems you pure of heart.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.257
He wishes you well
on your journey.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.478
Okay. Well, let's go.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.873
Wait. Madam, one moment.

in your soul.

Oh, um, well, I'm just worried
about his village.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.544
Okay. Pure intentions.
Troubled soul.

Oh, and skip the ride through
the deadly minefield?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.682
Nice try, Doc.No, I'm serious.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.074
There's some red marks
on his hand.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.554
Makes me think
he's been misdiagnosed.

08:31.598 --> 08:34.688
I appreciate the concern,
but I am a licensed medic.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.516
Okay, but trained professionals
can be wrong.

Not me, but,
you know, other people.

He might be suffering

08:40.520 --> 08:41.695

08:41.738 --> 08:42.783
It's a rare blood disorder.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.524
It mimics heart disease,

08:44.567 --> 08:45.916

Isn't it more likely
a man who is almost 90

08:48.789 --> 08:52.053
is having heart problems as
opposed to a rare disease?

08:52.096 --> 08:53.489
Yeah, but if it's
what I think it is,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.623
Behranu could live to be 100
if treated properly.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.928
And you want him to stick around

08:57.972 --> 08:59.190

at bay, right?

Dr. Curtis' theory?

All right, clock's ticking.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.684
When I was a child,
my town was overrun

11:24.727 --> 11:28.078

11:28.122 --> 11:29.514
They killed many.

I will repay them by learning
medicine and helping our people.

Well, if Behranu gave you

We will send it

He doesn't have a week.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.395
What are you doing?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.615
[grunts, hisses]
I'm improvising

17:31.659 --> 17:33.095
a hematocrit...
CALA:
To determine

17:33.139 --> 17:34.314
red blood cell count.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.532
Wow.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.317
You really did read
my medical books.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.753
Now let's see if you can
tell what I'm doing

17:38.796 --> 17:40.146
with the olive oil.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.148
CALA:
It stopped halfway down.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.760
Yep, because I do not
have polycythemia.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.545
Now, try Behranu's blood

17:48.589 --> 17:51.722
from his IV tube.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.724
CALA:
Right to the bottom.

17:53.768 --> 17:54.769
Telling you what?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.510
Behranu's blood is too thick.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.426
That's because he does
have polycythemia.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.689
His bone marrow produces
too many red blood cells,

18:01.732 --> 18:04.300
thus more iron in his blood,
thus his blood is heavier...

18:04.344 --> 18:05.693
That's why it sank faster!

18:05.736 --> 18:07.564
Behranu doesn't have
heart disease.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.479
That's an excellent diagnosis,
Doctor.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.135
WALTER: Okay.
Ideas, people. We're stuck.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.702
ALEX:
Come on, Scorpions!

18:14.745 --> 18:16.530
You're going to do
what you always do.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.706
You're going to take
whatever you find around you

18:18.749 --> 18:21.709
and use it in some crazy way
to save the day.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.885
Right?

18:23.928 --> 18:27.758
Kid, all we have are plumbing
supplies and spare tires.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.021
It's not enough to get us
through a minefield.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.806
Actually, maybe they are.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.329
See?

18:33.373 --> 18:35.244
Land mines aren't powerful
explosives, relatively speaking.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.681
So, they're meant
to blow straight up,

18:37.725 --> 18:39.727
killing whomever steps
on top of them,

18:39.770 --> 18:41.468
but causing very little damage

18:41.511 --> 18:42.860
to anything nearby.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.775
If the mines blow up
a couple yards ahead of us,

18:44.819 --> 18:47.474
assuming the shrapnel doesn't
get to us, they're no big deal.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.825
So, you're gonna make a mine
sweep out of PVC pipes?

18:50.868 --> 18:54.437
Minesweepers have a long row
of spinning metal flails

18:54.481 --> 18:56.047
to thump the ground ahead

18:56.091 --> 18:58.659
to explode the mines before
a vehicle can roll over them.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.226
We don't need
a long row of flails.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.793
We can explode only the mines
directly in our wheel path.

19:02.837 --> 19:03.794
CABE:
All right.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.187
Well, you clear the path

19:05.231 --> 19:06.754
with your pickup,
and we'll follow.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.364
Since it is polycythemia,

19:08.408 --> 19:10.192
I can fix Behranu
with a couple of pills.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.890
Your village elder will be
up and elding again in no time.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.415
Your olive oil test
is far from definitive.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.982
But I'm open to a course
of medicine.

19:18.026 --> 19:21.072
It'll take a few days for
any pharmaceuticals to get here.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.117
That's excellent.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.205
Thank you for trusting me.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.641
Uh, in the meantime,

19:24.685 --> 19:26.904
I need to relieve the pressure
on Behranu's heart

19:26.948 --> 19:29.690
with a little
old-fashioned phlebotomy.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.822
JELANI: You want to drain
Behranu's blood?

19:31.866 --> 19:34.042
Bloodletting went out
in the Middle Ages.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.783
That cardiac pressure
will kill him.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.612
He needs this procedure until
the proper medication arrives.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.483
Behranu is old and frail.

19:40.527 --> 19:41.615
Blood loss could kill him.

19:41.658 --> 19:42.964
Doing nothing willkill him.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.706
If I see you go
anywhere near our elder,

19:45.749 --> 19:47.882
I'll have you arrested.

20:03.941 --> 20:04.986
HAPPY:
Okay, my end's connected
to the grill!

20:05.029 --> 20:06.074
Waitress?

20:06.117 --> 20:07.249
PAIGE:
Done!

20:07.293 --> 20:08.816
Last of the spokes in?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.122
WALTER:
Roger that!

20:11.166 --> 20:12.733
CABE:
All right, let's blow up
some mines!

20:18.478 --> 20:19.870
[grunts]

20:20.871 --> 20:23.961
These scarves
are incredibly inconvenient.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.963
It's good for covering
your lying face.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.965
Comms out.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.187
I heard you at the fuel pump,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.449
carefully choosing your words

20:33.493 --> 20:35.538
so you're technically
not lying to Paige.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.888
I'm not comfortable with how
this is playing out either.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.977
Paige's EQ meter
picks up everything,

20:40.021 --> 20:41.718
and I don't want
to mislead her,

20:41.762 --> 20:44.634
but now is not the time or
the place for this discussion.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.115
We're literally in the middle
of a minefield.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.595
Not nearly as big
as the minefield

20:48.638 --> 20:50.510
you're creating
for yourself, dumbass.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.815
Comms in.

20:53.948 --> 20:54.992
All right.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.821
Let's see what happens.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.432
CALA:
I checked on Behranu.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.521
His vitals are no better.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.826
His heart's
been pumping

21:02.870 --> 21:04.219
that thick, sludge blood
for months.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.874
It just makes his
cardiopulmonary system so weak.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.441
[sighs]

21:08.484 --> 21:10.747
He needs meds, and he needs
to stay on that ventilator

21:10.791 --> 21:12.227
to get stronger,
but none of that matters

21:12.271 --> 21:13.707
if I can't relieve
the pressure on his heart

21:13.750 --> 21:15.056
by draining some blood.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.579
Jelani won't ever allow it.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.494
[sighs]

21:18.538 --> 21:20.017
You think you could talk to him?

21:20.061 --> 21:24.108
I cannot go against the man
who helped save my life.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.285
He gave me a
second chance,

21:26.328 --> 21:28.025
a family.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.331
You wouldn't understand
what it is like

21:29.375 --> 21:31.028
to fear losing your family.

21:31.072 --> 21:31.986
Cala, I know that

21:32.029 --> 21:33.335
that is a really scary feeling,

21:33.379 --> 21:36.251
but if we can't
keep Behranu alive,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.688
those peace talks fail,
and then you're gonna lose

21:38.732 --> 21:40.908
all the things that are
important to you, anyway.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.353
Crap, you really feel them,
don't you?

21:51.397 --> 21:55.009
They're bouncing around
like lottery balls.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.010
But it's working. They're okay.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.446
ALEX:
It's just like that time

21:57.490 --> 22:00.231
Sylvester pushed a boulder
down a hill to detonate

22:00.275 --> 22:02.495
buried munitions so you
could save everyone

22:02.538 --> 22:04.627
when Scorpion was
marooned on that island.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.977
You kind of laid it on thick
with Alex.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.110
I might have gotten
carried away.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.241
[explosions]

22:10.285 --> 22:12.548
Hey, Happy. Got an ETA
on that fuel?

22:12.592 --> 22:14.202
Things are kind of bleak here.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.508
Not really rosy here
either, pal.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.031
We have homemade
minesweepers

22:17.074 --> 22:18.859
and we're driving
through real bad...

22:19.512 --> 22:20.513
Look out!

22:28.477 --> 22:29.478
Happy.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.093
[coughs]

22:38.008 --> 22:40.097
Walt, Happy,
are you all right?

22:40.141 --> 22:42.143
We're okay.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.930
Happy...

22:46.974 --> 22:49.063
But maybe not for long.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.151
Why not?

22:50.194 --> 22:52.022
Because there is
an activated mine

22:52.066 --> 22:53.763
right under Walter's head.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.911
Cabe, are they okay?

23:10.954 --> 23:12.739
We're getting to 'em now.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.829
Stay in the tracks of their
skid; we know that's safe.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.660
SYLVESTER:
We're outside the car.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.705
Whatever you do, don't touch it.
You shift this thing

23:22.749 --> 23:23.924
and the window breaks any more,

23:23.967 --> 23:25.839
the mine's pressure plate
releases.

23:25.882 --> 23:29.669
Then the mine detonates
and shrapnel hits the gas tank.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.671
Which will cause
another explosion.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.150
And we all blow up.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.718
I don't like being a part
of Team Scorpion anymore.

23:35.762 --> 23:40.114
Guys... we need a plan.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.637
How we gonna get them out now?

23:41.681 --> 23:42.725
TOBY:
You need something

23:42.769 --> 23:44.466
to hold down the mine's trigger.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.859
With what? We're
surrounded by sand.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.862
That's it. We need to fill
the cab with enough sand

23:48.905 --> 23:50.516
to offset my
and Walter's weight.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.257
A bucket fell out of the truck.
I'll go get it.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.346
How are we gonna get
the sand in the cab?

23:55.390 --> 23:56.435
If Happy rolls the window down,

23:56.478 --> 23:57.479
it'll shake the truck
and then...

23:57.523 --> 23:59.263
Boom. Don't remind me.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.135
Oh, there's a hole
in the windshield.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.050
I'll hit the lights for you

24:03.093 --> 24:05.095
so you can see
where you're going.

24:06.836 --> 24:07.837
Stay close to the truck.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.404
Based on patterns
we've observed,

24:09.448 --> 24:10.579
I doubt that
there's another mine

24:10.623 --> 24:12.059
within ten to 12
feet of this one,

24:12.102 --> 24:13.408
but I can't be sure.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.018
Hole's small.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.456
It'll take a long time
to get enough sand in there.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.849
Not if we can build a funnel.
We got plumbing supplies.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.024
We can do this.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.071
Jelani, fuel delivery's delayed

24:24.114 --> 24:26.639
and I don't think you have much
more time with the ventilator.

24:26.682 --> 24:27.770
What the hell?

24:27.814 --> 24:28.989
Fuel's almost gone.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.686
Ventilator is running on fumes.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.993
His oxygen level
is critical.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.168
He's unresponsive.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.170
Damn it, man.
I need to let his blood.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.302
No! You and your team
promised fuel.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.956
You promised
to save him.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.001
Stay away!

24:50.880 --> 24:53.143
Faster. We need almost
300 pounds of sand

24:53.187 --> 24:54.536
to offset their weight.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.712
In order to ensure
that trigger stays depressed,

24:56.756 --> 24:58.801
we need to not only put the sand
inside the cab,

24:58.845 --> 25:00.847
but also on top of the window,

25:00.890 --> 25:03.937
which means Walter needs
to be completely covered.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.895
I can pull my jacket
over my head,

25:05.939 --> 25:08.289
give myself a pocket of air.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.606
God, he's being buried alive.Yes, but it's his only shot.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.999
Okay, that should be
enough weight to offset Happy.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.045
Happy! You're clear!

25:28.352 --> 25:30.529
See you on the outside, Walt.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.017
Help me get sand in the window.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.985
He's almost covered!

25:57.730 --> 25:59.035
He's gonna suffocate.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.647
He has a small air pocket.
He can pull it off.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.214
Walter? Walter, can you hear me?

26:06.086 --> 26:08.044
He can't answer you,
he's trying to conserve air.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.264
Walter, listen to me.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.005
Just like you wanted
to tell me something

26:12.048 --> 26:15.574
when I was in that plane,
in case things went badly,

26:15.617 --> 26:18.838
I need to tell you something now
for the same reason.

26:18.881 --> 26:22.232
If things go bad...

26:22.276 --> 26:24.408
I don't want there to be
anything between us

26:24.452 --> 26:26.410
and I know you're keeping
something from me.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.238
I don't care what it is.
I love you.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.763
When you get
out of here--

26:30.806 --> 26:33.374
and you will get out of here--

26:33.417 --> 26:36.507
please talk to me.

26:36.551 --> 26:40.555
Tell me what's going on, okay?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.688
Whatever it is,
we're gonna be okay.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.342
That's enough weight.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.909
Walt, climb out.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.436
Climb out now, Walt!

26:53.699 --> 26:56.484
Walter! He's not coming out.

26:56.527 --> 26:59.139
Come on out, damn it!

26:59.182 --> 26:59.618
Walter!

27:04.448 --> 27:07.495
Guys, he's not
coming out.

27:07.538 --> 27:11.020
Sand's too heavy.
We got to dig him out.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.544
No, you shake up the truck,
you blow us up!

27:13.588 --> 27:16.635
Walter! Just push up
to my voice.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.766
Walter!

27:17.810 --> 27:19.638
Walter!

27:25.469 --> 27:26.470
Oh, thank God.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.605
Steady!

27:30.649 --> 27:31.867
Steady.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.695
Get him away from the truck
just to be safe.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.044
The minesweepers
broke off.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.611
Let's get them and put
them on the fuel truck.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.830
All right, I'll give you a hand.

27:47.491 --> 27:48.971
[groans]

27:49.015 --> 27:51.974
I heard what you said.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.150
I have been keeping
something from you.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.372
The lecture wasn't canceled.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.679
It wasn't?

28:00.722 --> 28:02.637
You... you went without me?

28:02.681 --> 28:03.812
Yes.

28:03.856 --> 28:07.076
And I... I b...

28:07.120 --> 28:08.643
I am so proud of you.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.777
You showed real EQ.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.561
You knew I didn't want
to go to the lecture,

28:13.604 --> 28:14.605
so you told a white lie

28:14.649 --> 28:16.564
to spare me
a boring night.

28:16.607 --> 28:19.741
That's what you've been
so guilty about lately?

28:19.785 --> 28:21.438
Yeah.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.526
[knocking on window]

28:22.570 --> 28:25.704
Some help with the minesweepers!

28:25.747 --> 28:28.968
Hey, rest. I'll help.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.669
Don't look at me like that.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.717
Give me that comm. You just
made things a lot worse.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.197
You let her think that you went
to the lecture alone,

28:41.241 --> 28:43.112
but the truth is just lurking
under the surface

28:43.156 --> 28:44.940
and it's waiting to blow up
in your face.

28:44.984 --> 28:48.596
Well, I have this under control.
Nothing's gonna blow up.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.772
[explosion]

28:50.816 --> 28:53.514
You were saying?

28:55.472 --> 28:56.691
Guys, our generator's dead

28:56.735 --> 28:58.606
and we need that
ventilator on.

28:58.649 --> 29:02.218
CPR's only gonna keep Behranu
alive for so long.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.307
If the move I'm about
to pull off doesn't work,

29:04.351 --> 29:06.048
he's not the only one
who's gonna need life support.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.528
Doc, what are you planning?!

29:07.571 --> 29:10.574
[sighs] Something the Brits
call a "bloody mess."

29:10.618 --> 29:12.794
Uh, how-how is he?He's still weak.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.578
I can help take
the strain off his heart

29:14.622 --> 29:16.015
and you're gonna hate me,
but I don't care.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.538
Hey, hey-hey-hey-hey,

29:17.581 --> 29:19.366
grab him!
Stay back.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.021
Cala.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.937
I'm trying to save our people,
as is Dr. Curtis.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.200
He will not let
Behranu die.

29:27.243 --> 29:28.723
The only way
he lives is to relieve

29:28.767 --> 29:29.985
the pressure on his heart,

29:30.029 --> 29:31.117
and the only way to do
that is to drain blood.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.640
Go get help!

29:32.683 --> 29:34.642
Thanks, kid.Always knew I'd
use a scalpel

29:34.685 --> 29:37.123
to save lives,
just not like this.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.606
Things sound crazy over
there, Doc, just hold on,

29:42.650 --> 29:44.565
we're not far off.

29:44.608 --> 29:47.133
He's bleeding all over the
floor. You're killing him!

29:47.176 --> 29:50.049
How will we know
if this worked?Behranu will wake up.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.355
If he loses much more,
he will be dead.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.748
Just hang on, any second now.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.142
[door opens]

29:56.185 --> 29:57.230
Step aside.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.709
Oh, get out of the way.

29:58.753 --> 29:59.972
Get on the ground.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.364
Don't move.

30:02.626 --> 30:03.889
Doc, what was that?

30:03.932 --> 30:05.804
That was the sound
of time running out.

30:05.847 --> 30:09.677
It is okay. I will reattach
the IV and stop the bleeding.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.374
No, a little longer.
He'll regain consciousness.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.767
Quiet.
You have caused enough harm.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.508
[groans]

30:14.551 --> 30:16.510
Look, he's awake.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.642
Call off your goon so I can
treat him before he dies.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.470
Uh, let him up.

30:20.514 --> 30:24.083
Uh, I broke the connector,
I'm gonna need another one

30:24.126 --> 30:25.649
and some forceps
to stop the bleeding.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.435
[hums]

30:29.131 --> 30:30.785
Okay, I'm almost done.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.048
Great, all sealed up.

30:33.092 --> 30:35.268
And I need a new IV bag. Happy?

30:35.311 --> 30:37.487
How close is the fuel?[truck honking]

30:37.531 --> 30:39.489
Oh, that's pretty close.
Uh, fuel's here.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.712
Here!

30:44.755 --> 30:46.932
The generator's in here.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.108
It's here.

30:52.938 --> 30:55.766
Go, Walt. Let her rip.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.728
Okay, people,
look alive in there.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.817
[motor running]

31:10.694 --> 31:12.131
The ventilator's working.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.176
Yeah, your old-timer's
gonna be okay.

31:15.699 --> 31:18.615
Look, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me, eh?

31:18.659 --> 31:20.269
It's all right.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.445
When you-you care about someone
so much, it drives you crazy.

31:22.489 --> 31:26.014
Oh, sweet,
ventilator's working.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.322
I can understand the feeling.

31:32.586 --> 31:33.761
Hey, Hap?

31:33.804 --> 31:35.197
Please, no more driving around

31:35.241 --> 31:36.677
in minefields for a while?

31:43.684 --> 31:48.036
Dr. Curtis. I spoke with
the hospital in the capital.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.039
They are sending the
hydroxyurea pills tomorrow.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.389
Well, two weeks of that
in Behranu's system,

31:53.433 --> 31:55.000
he's not just gonna survive,
he'll thrive.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.437
As will the peace process.
Well done, Doctor.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.568
Thank you.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.831
CALA:
Dr. Curtis.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.877
I'd like you to meet my parents.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.879
Wow, it is an
absolute pleasure.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.446
Oh, we were so worried.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.491
We couldn't make it here
through the storm,

32:08.535 --> 32:11.103
but Cala told us
you kept her safe.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.975
I kept her safe? No, no, no.
She pulled my bacon

32:14.019 --> 32:16.456
out of the fire, trust me.
You guys, you raised

32:16.499 --> 32:18.371
an incredible daughter here.

32:18.414 --> 32:21.591
In truth,
Cala raised us.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.986
She came into our lives
at three years old.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.076
Taught us what
strength looks like.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.687
Bring it in.

32:30.731 --> 32:34.213
You are gonna make one heck
of a sawbones, pal.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.605
Hey, keep your eyes
on your mailbox.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.172
I'm sending you more
medical books, I promise.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.354
ALEX:
Sylvester.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.400
I still can't believe
I got to work a case

32:47.443 --> 32:48.488
with Team Scorpion.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.316
You're an honorary
member, kid.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.666
Thank you.
And thank you

32:52.709 --> 32:54.276
most of all, Sylvester.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.409
I can't believe I got to meet
the most incredible man

32:56.452 --> 32:58.498
I've been reading about
all these years.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.587
That's very kind,
Alex,

33:00.630 --> 33:03.198
but I may have stretched
the truth a bit

33:03.242 --> 33:04.417
in my letters.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.594
Don't get me wrong,
those things happened.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.596
I just didn't necessarily
do them myself.

33:09.639 --> 33:12.164
I wanted you to have
a sponsor

33:12.207 --> 33:14.427
that... you could look up to.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.559
CABE:
Are you kidding me?

33:16.603 --> 33:19.475
Sly went undercover in prison.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.000
He went down the side
of a 20-story building

33:22.043 --> 33:23.697
on solar panels.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.568
He captured a snake

33:25.612 --> 33:26.743
with his bare hands

33:26.787 --> 33:28.354
so the venom could
save my life.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.182
He's a regular
superhero.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.010
Okay, you're right.
I-I did do those things.

33:32.053 --> 33:36.405
I just felt like it was
all of us doing them.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.972
You know what
bothers me, though,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.365
is that your default

33:39.408 --> 33:41.845
is to think that you,
on your own,

33:41.889 --> 33:43.673
somehow is not good enough.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.284
You have character and heart.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.720
But sometimes
you forget that.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.939
Maybe that's why you haven't
asked out Florence yet.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.811
Ah, Florence!

33:50.854 --> 33:53.292
The tall blonde from next
door who lusts after you?

33:57.557 --> 34:00.386
TOBY:
Next, we're gonna look at

34:00.429 --> 34:02.431
how different
food groups interact

34:02.475 --> 34:05.478
with the hormones
you'll be taking.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.352
And the pterodactyls
we'll be house-breaking

34:10.396 --> 34:11.832
and the maracas
you'll be shaking.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.574
Okay, sure.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.402
And you're not listening.
Happy, we got to get through

34:16.445 --> 34:17.838
all this fertility research.

34:17.881 --> 34:20.536
I was thinking about Cala.

34:20.580 --> 34:26.107
About her being three,
alone, with no family.

34:26.151 --> 34:30.938
Same as me
when I was three.

34:30.981 --> 34:35.421
But then those people
gave her a family.

34:35.464 --> 34:38.119
When I was a kid,
I wished every day

34:38.163 --> 34:40.991
for a family to adopt me.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.907
To make me theirs,
and they could be mine.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.259
But that never happened.
No one wanted me.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.698
Right now, there is
a kid somewhere

34:51.741 --> 34:55.397
wishing for a family.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.443
They could be ours.

34:57.486 --> 34:58.531
We could be theirs.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.709
I want to make
our dream come true

35:02.752 --> 35:05.538
by making a kid's
dream come true.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.325
You cool with that?

35:13.981 --> 35:18.203
In all my years here...

35:18.246 --> 35:21.423
all the thoughts
and theories and plans

35:21.467 --> 35:25.906
that we've devised
in this garage...

35:25.949 --> 35:27.777
that is the best idea
I've ever heard.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.917
Thank you.
Good luck out there.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.094
U.N. mine clearance team
will be in Surayto tomorrow.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.704
The sooner the better.

35:41.748 --> 35:42.575
The sooner Florence
gets here the better.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.098
I already have flop sweat.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.796
But I went to the grocery store.
I got flowers.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.321
[sniffs]
They're fresh.Relax.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.236
I got a good feeling about this.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.542
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:53.586 --> 35:56.154
Walter, what's this?

35:58.068 --> 36:02.377
Uh, it's my copy of
Perndon Whitbry's book.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.900
Why do you have it?Since I couldn't
get tickets

36:03.944 --> 36:05.685
to the lecture, I was
gonna send him the book

36:05.728 --> 36:08.209
to have it autographed
as an anniversary present.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.732
But when I pulled it
off the shelf,

36:09.776 --> 36:11.647
I found these inside.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.129
Land mine's about
to go off.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.522
Well, I often keep
ticket stubs

36:16.565 --> 36:18.132
of particularly
interesting lectures.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.220
But why are there two?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.309
I saved one
for my guest.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.747
You went with someone else?
Why didn't you tell me that?

36:24.791 --> 36:26.575
Well, it wasn't, uh,
particularly, uh,

36:26.619 --> 36:28.708
relevant information.Walter,

36:28.751 --> 36:30.318
what are you scared to tell me?

36:30.362 --> 36:31.537
Who did you go out with?[door opens, shuts]

36:31.580 --> 36:32.625
Hi, everybody.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.675
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

36:39.719 --> 36:43.070
Um, I have no idea
what I just walked into.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.506
A buzz saw.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.770
Sylvester left a message for me.

36:47.814 --> 36:48.815
He said he had
something to ask me.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.512
PAIGE:
I have something to ask you.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.297
Did you go to that lecture
with Walter?

36:53.515 --> 36:55.038
Don't look at him.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.866
I'm asking the question.

36:56.910 --> 37:00.435
Yes.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.263
You know, Walter said
they just went as friends.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.701
Hold on. You knew?

37:05.745 --> 37:08.487
I'm just finding out now.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.926
I-I can't believe
all of you guys knew.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.276
Hey, Paige, Paige, if
we could just go ups...No.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.278
No, Paige, listen to me.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.714
We never so much

37:18.758 --> 37:20.368
as held each other's hands.
Isn't that right, Flo?

37:20.412 --> 37:22.152
We never held hands.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.458
You are so clueless.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.721
You hid this.
You hid it because

37:25.765 --> 37:28.768
you knew deep down
you did something wrong.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.379
When I was buried alive you said
no matter what I told you,

37:31.423 --> 37:33.163
it would be okay,
remember?You didn't tell me anything.

37:33.207 --> 37:36.776
I found out!

37:36.819 --> 37:38.865
You've been having
a cranial affair

37:38.908 --> 37:41.041
with Florence for months.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.216
Lectures and working late
at the white board

37:42.260 --> 37:43.391
and kissing dreams.

37:43.435 --> 37:46.002
Hey, Toby said that
dream meant nothing.

37:46.046 --> 37:47.569
Of course it means something.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.484
I don't satisfy
all your needs, Walter.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.357
I'm incapable of scratching
your intellectual itch because

37:52.400 --> 37:54.794
I am just a normal human.
And truth be told,

37:54.837 --> 37:58.058
I am completely exhausted
trying to convince myself

37:58.101 --> 38:00.278
that you satisfy me.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.935
For once, I would like
to walk on the beach with you

38:05.979 --> 38:07.720
without a marine
biology lecture,

38:07.763 --> 38:10.070
or go to dinner with you
without a dissertation

38:10.113 --> 38:12.725
on the inefficiencies
of putting parsley

38:12.768 --> 38:14.117
on the freaking plate.

38:14.161 --> 38:18.470
Or to hang out with my friends
without you looking...

38:18.513 --> 38:20.733
absolutely miserable.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.648
There is a part of you
that is attracted to Florence

38:22.691 --> 38:26.826
in a way that you could
never... be attracted to me.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.355
I worked so hard at this
experiment, Walter.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.662
I really did.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.098
It is over.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.229
You're being ridiculous.

38:39.273 --> 38:42.885
I have no feelings
for Florence,

38:42.929 --> 38:45.366
and she has none for me.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.846
Isn't that right...

38:46.889 --> 38:49.762
Florence?

38:49.805 --> 38:51.546
Tell her.

38:51.590 --> 38:55.681
It would seem that,
over the past few months,

38:55.724 --> 38:59.380
I have developed
feelings for you.

39:08.694 --> 39:09.999
Jaw dropper.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.961
For the record,
I was unaware.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.963
FLORENCE:
Paige...

39:17.006 --> 39:19.879
I am so sorry.

39:19.922 --> 39:23.012
I didn't mean for it to happen,
but it did.

39:23.056 --> 39:26.842
For what it's worth, Walter,

39:26.886 --> 39:28.061
it's not your fault.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.803
When I met you,
emotionally, you were nine.

39:30.846 --> 39:35.590
I got you to 15, 16?

39:37.462 --> 39:40.247
But I think that's
as far as you can go.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.814
I don't blame you.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.860
SYLVESTER:
Well, I do.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.427
You said there's nothing
going on between you two,

39:46.471 --> 39:49.299
but you made her
fall in love with you.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.432
How did I make her do anything?

39:51.476 --> 39:52.564
Well, you invite her
to work with us.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.826
You take her out.

39:53.869 --> 39:57.351
You tell her you dream
about kissing her.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.832
You were seducing her
all along, Walter.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.181
I was the one who was
in love with her,

40:01.224 --> 40:02.878
and now you ruined it.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.576
Sylvester...

40:04.619 --> 40:08.406
You know how hard it's been
for me to even consider

40:08.449 --> 40:10.059
dating anybody
since Megan died.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.670
Don't bring up my sister.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.411
If you were a real man

40:13.454 --> 40:15.456
instead of a comic
book-reading baby boy,

40:15.500 --> 40:16.892
then you would have
asked Flo out

40:16.936 --> 40:18.285
a long time ago.

40:18.328 --> 40:19.678
There was nothing
stopping you,

40:19.721 --> 40:22.420
and you're using my
sister as a crutch.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.725
Hey!

40:23.769 --> 40:24.944
Enough!

40:24.987 --> 40:25.945
Family does not lay hands

40:25.988 --> 40:28.469
on each other.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.950
Sly, what do you got
to say for yourself?

40:30.993 --> 40:33.387
I quit.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.955
I can't work for you anymore.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.264
Me neither.

40:41.308 --> 40:42.483
WALTER:
Right.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.006
So you're just gonna--
you're gonna dump me

40:44.050 --> 40:45.486
and you're quitting?

40:45.530 --> 40:46.618
HAPPY:
Satisfied, O'Brien?

40:46.661 --> 40:47.923
We are in the middle
of a minefield,

40:47.967 --> 40:49.882
and things are blowing up
all over.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.449
Gee, who could have
predicted this?

40:51.492 --> 40:53.581
I have had it
with you two know-it-alls!

40:53.625 --> 40:54.800
CABE:
All right, listen.

40:54.843 --> 40:57.150
Everybody,
just give Walt a beat.

40:57.193 --> 41:00.240
Cabe is right-- there is
plenty of blame to go around.

41:00.283 --> 41:03.025
How sweet of you to
stick up for your boyfriend.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.810
WALTER: Oh, you're just
leaving now, huh? Wh-What about

41:04.853 --> 41:06.420
everything that we've been
through? The Gettleman pitch

41:06.464 --> 41:08.030
coming up, huh?

41:08.074 --> 41:10.511
What? You guys, too?

41:10.555 --> 41:11.686
Wh-What, are you gonna
leave me high and dry?

41:15.168 --> 41:17.257
What the hell is gonna
happen to us now?

41:25.265 --> 41:27.920
Have to say,
this is an impressive pitch.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.312
I have one more interview
lined up,

41:29.356 --> 41:31.140
but I can posit you're
in a very good position.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.403
Well, Scorpion 2.0
is leaner and more efficient

41:33.447 --> 41:35.014
than its predecessor.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.972
And we look forward to helping
you with your company.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.931
Sounds good.
Thank you for coming in.

41:42.587 --> 41:44.023
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.415
Yeah.
Okay...

41:45.459 --> 41:47.896
Well, seems my next
appointment's already here.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.332
Mr. Gettleman.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.551
GETTLEMAN:
Ms. Dineen.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.597
Come right on in.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.037
Is that a centipede
on your shirt?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.081
That's what you went with?

41:59.125 --> 42:00.909
Centipedes are
agile and fierce.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.041
Like us.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.869
You could say we are
Human Centipedes.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.480
[quietly]:
Told you not to use that term.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.742
You didn't watch
the movie, did you?

42:07.786 --> 42:08.874
It was in the horror section.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.005
WALTER:
Good luck.

42:10.049 --> 42:11.485
You're gonna need it.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.182
Perhaps we'll see you at
the Beauchamp pitch next week.

42:13.226 --> 42:14.575
Don't think so.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.142
What? Too complicated
for you guys?

42:16.185 --> 42:17.578
HAPPY: Nope.TOBY: Nope.

42:19.232 --> 42:20.799
We already got that job.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.069
Paige, wait.
