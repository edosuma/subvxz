WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:03.669
So just because i'm back

00:03.671 --> 00:05.404
Doesn't mean i want to
quit me and you.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.007
I'm not really the "sneak around
behind dad's back" kind of guy.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.308
Oh, i get it now.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.576
You meet a nice guy

00:10.578 --> 00:12.411
And he finds out
you have an adult daughter

00:12.413 --> 00:14.146
That you haven't talked to
in eight years

00:14.148 --> 00:15.547
And thinks it's
a little weird.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.017
So what was so important you
couldn't tell me over the phone?

00:18.019 --> 00:19.785
I'm working the desk at
johnny's rental truck company.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.552
There's this one customer.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.022
When he returned
his last rental,

00:23.024 --> 00:24.356
I found this in the back.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.624
I think he killed somebody.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.130
Bunny found this in the back
of one of johnny's trucks.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.131
Johnny?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.132
My husband.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.701
What happened to choppy?

00:35.703 --> 00:38.037
Johnny runs a moving truck
rental company,

00:38.039 --> 00:39.805
And i help out.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.275
Someone could have cut
their hand moving a piano.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.278
The guy who rented that truck
comes in every couple of weeks.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.581
Really sketchy.
Pays only cash.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.116
If i found that glove,

00:51.118 --> 00:53.685
I'd hate to think what else
i'm gonna find.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.155
Even if i wanted to
look into this,

00:56.157 --> 00:58.657
I can't get a warrant 'cause
you touched blood evidence.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.293
That's why i gave erin
the rental agreements.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.430
(lindsay)
everyone who rents a truck
gets their license photocopied.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.698
Name on that license
is robert o'shea.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.069
I ran it through dmv
and ncic--

01:10.071 --> 01:11.303
License is a fake.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.172
Robert o'shea is an alias.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.274
This is nick vosh,

01:15.276 --> 01:18.143
Recently paroled from menard
for robbery.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.745
I checked his
last known address;

01:19.747 --> 01:24.516
He's crashing in
brighton park.

01:24.518 --> 01:28.821
You really want
to chase this?

01:28.823 --> 01:32.291
I think it's worth a look.

01:32.293 --> 01:36.428
All right. Grab halstead.
Go check out this vosh.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.398
Now, i'm gonna need
a complete statement from you.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.235
We're going by the book
on this one.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.440
Hey, don't get
too comfortable.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.443
We got to do a drive-by
on a possible offender.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.579
Bunny?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.614
I'll explain later.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.485
Hey.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.686
Carrying bricks in there?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.187
Uh, criminal law books.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.189
I got to keep cramming
for this test.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.291
Listen, atwater has a bunch
of unused personal days.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.426
He's on forced furlough.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.560
Can you man his desk?

02:08.562 --> 02:10.262
Of course.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.430
- Thanks.
- Sure.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.750
You a good samaritan now?

02:14.751 --> 02:16.234
You gonna start
a neighborhood watch too?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.636
I'm telling the truth,
hank.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.637
Hmm.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.671
I don't want this guy
vosh

02:19.673 --> 02:20.772
Renting one of
johnny's trucks,

02:20.774 --> 02:21.773
Doing something illegal,

02:21.775 --> 02:24.209
And having it come back on us.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.644
You sure this isn't some ploy
to get back in erin's life?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.213
Erin can make
her own decisions,

02:30.784 --> 02:32.351
And it's not really
any of your business.

02:32.352 --> 02:33.919
Whatever it is that you think
you can reach inside erin

02:33.921 --> 02:35.687
Is long gone.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.424
You don't have to like it,

02:39.426 --> 02:43.162
But i am part
of her life now.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.864
I'm gonna need
that statement.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.734
(halstead)
couldn't sleep the other night.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.336
So i was up watching tv,
and i saw this doctor

02:51.338 --> 02:53.338
Talking about
commitment phobia.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.474
He was saying it had to do
with family patterns

02:55.476 --> 02:56.909
And survival instincts.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.510
I'm just saying,
you know,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.647
Bunny's been married,
what, five times?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.750
Don't try to
psychoanalyze me, jay.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.185
Have you given
any more thought

03:06.187 --> 03:07.686
To whether or not
we should tell voight?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.321
No, we're not
telling voight.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.490
He pardoned
burgess and ruzek.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.958
Burgess was shot.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.793
Her and ruzek are
an exception to the rule.

03:14.795 --> 03:15.861
Do you want to take a bullet

03:15.863 --> 03:17.496
So that voight will give
his blessing?

03:17.498 --> 03:20.532
I'd take a bullet just to come
over to your house tonight.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.273
What part of your body
would you sacrifice?

03:28.275 --> 03:29.942
Uh...

03:29.944 --> 03:32.678
Shoulder?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.446
Fleshy part of the thigh.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.582
- Now i feel special.
- You should.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.654
(halstead)
where's the box truck?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.289
Let's find out.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.324
Yep.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.017 --> 04:12.384
(halstead)
either he's shopping
for a new muffler...

04:12.386 --> 04:15.554
Or he's casing
the check exchange.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.935
(halstead)
call it in.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.537
We got a robbery in progress.
Requesting backup.

04:32.539 --> 04:33.872
2145 dearborn.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.308
- Only two ways out.
- Let's go.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.624
(halstead)
hey! Police!
Get across the street.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.565
[gunshot]

05:00.567 --> 05:02.301
[glass shatters]

05:02.303 --> 05:03.402
Damn!
Bulletproof glass.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.403
(vosh)
come on!

05:04.405 --> 05:06.004
Police!
Drop your weapon!

05:06.006 --> 05:07.339
Get back!

05:07.341 --> 05:09.308
Officers, please help!
Help me!

05:09.310 --> 05:10.509
(vosh)
just do it!
Don't worry about them!

05:10.511 --> 05:11.710
(lindsay)
let's tear-gas him.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.445
(vosh)
let's go! In the top--

05:13.447 --> 05:14.613
- All right. All right.
- Hurry up!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.515
[woman crying]

05:17.918 --> 05:19.418
[tear gas grenade clatters]

05:19.420 --> 05:20.686
[gas hissing]

05:20.688 --> 05:22.020
[gunshot]

05:22.022 --> 05:23.522
Come on!
Come on!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.492
Come on!

05:27.494 --> 05:30.529
[both coughing]

05:41.809 --> 05:42.608
.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.408
[both coughing]

05:43.410 --> 05:45.510
(vosh)
open it! Open it!

05:45.512 --> 05:47.646
(halstead)
drop your weapon!
Let go of her!

05:47.648 --> 05:49.915
[both coughing]

05:49.917 --> 05:50.949
Ah!

05:50.951 --> 05:52.017
[gunshot]

05:52.019 --> 05:53.485
[woman shouts and gasps]

05:58.926 --> 06:00.359
Are you okay?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.027
[coughs]
my boy--

06:02.029 --> 06:04.629
My husband, he ha--
he has them.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.465
He's holding them hostage.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.466
Who does?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.034
He does!

06:09.036 --> 06:10.769
George 50-21.
Shots fired by the police.

06:10.771 --> 06:11.937
Offender down.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.739
- Roll an ambo to our location.
- Copy that.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.773
What's your name?

06:14.775 --> 06:17.409
Sarah normark.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.711
My husband, dean,
my boy, travis,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.446
He has a photo of them.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.482
[coughs]
it's on his phone.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.616
Jay.

06:29.823 --> 06:30.922
All right.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.624
Where is this?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.493
Could be our basement.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.894
Okay.
What's your address?

06:35.896 --> 06:39.631
It's 3398
north racine.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.833
Lincoln 50-21,
i need a patrol unit

06:41.835 --> 06:44.136
To check on a possibly
abducted family.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.196
Clear!

07:12.699 --> 07:14.032
(roman)
basement's clear!

07:14.034 --> 07:15.500
It's empty.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.605
21-13 squad,

07:20.607 --> 07:23.809
We got an aggravated
home invasion and kidnapping.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.978
Tracked the cell on
the other end of vosh's phone.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.914
It was thrown in a dumpster
near the river.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.649
Roman and burgess
are checking it out.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.917
This is gina gawronski.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.151
We used to work vice together.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.836
- How's it going?
- Thanks.

07:34.837 --> 07:36.520
Now she's rocking it
in robbery-homicide.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.856
- Hi.
- Welcome.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.990
Thanks.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.225
Looks like you guys
caught a crew

07:40.227 --> 07:41.893
We've been trying
to get for months.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.462
You have one offender
in custody?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.464
Yes, ma'am.
Nick vosh.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.998
He's over at chicago med
in surgery.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.900
Whoever he's working with,
though, is still out there

07:48.902 --> 07:50.902
With sarah normark's family,
so...

07:50.904 --> 07:52.637
From what we know,
there's two of them,

07:52.639 --> 07:54.172
And they've robbed
seven check exchanges

07:54.174 --> 07:55.640
In the last two months.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.075
Well, check exchanges
aren't fdic,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.777
So fbi won't get involved.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.078
That's right.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.047
And you can steal more
than you get at most banks.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.216
These guys have grabbed
50k to 60k each time.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.452
Nearly a half mil so far.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.219
All right,
what do we have on them?

08:07.221 --> 08:09.621
Until now, not much.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.156
Two white males,
well-built.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.024
One robs the
check exchange manager;

08:13.026 --> 08:15.627
The other one holds their family
hostage in a box truck.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.062
There's no gps
in those old trucks

08:17.064 --> 08:18.497
So they're difficult
to track.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.565
It's like
a roving prison cell.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.033
We were hoping
the reward money

08:22.035 --> 08:23.969
Would help us catch a break,
but...

08:23.971 --> 08:25.670
What reward money?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.206
About a week ago, the check
exchange put up 25 grand

08:28.208 --> 08:31.543
For any information leading
to the arrest of the offenders.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.910
(dawson)
so if this guy's out there

08:32.913 --> 08:34.279
And he knows his partner
got popped,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.947
No telling what he'll do
with the family.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.649
(gawronski)
yeah, that's right.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.717
And he's the more violent
of the two.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.921
During their third robbery,
a dye pack went off in his face

08:42.923 --> 08:45.056
When the manager
was handing over the cash,

08:45.058 --> 08:46.558
So he shot
the manager's wife

08:48.629 --> 08:49.194
And dumped her body
in the forest preserve.

08:49.195 --> 08:49.760
(voight)
all right, thanks.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.663
- We'll take it from here.
- Yeah.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.603
(nadia)
hey.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.038
Uh, we just finished,
actually.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.574
I was very thorough
with the forms.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.709
I'm sure you were.
Thanks.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.877
Can you give us a sec?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.145
Yeah.
Of course.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.882
I'm gonna go take these
to voight.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.317
[clears throat]
bye.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.188
I am so proud of you, erin,
for being such a good role model

09:17.190 --> 09:18.590
For that girl.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.726
So it looks like
you were right.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.562
That guy renting
from you and johnny,

09:23.564 --> 09:26.865
Him and his partner have been
robbing check exchanges.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.166
I knew it.

09:28.168 --> 09:32.971
I had a feeling about that guy
from day one.

09:32.973 --> 09:37.275
Did you also know
about the reward?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.710
What reward?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.979
The company that owns
the check exchanges

09:40.981 --> 09:44.783
Put out a $25,000 reward.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.652
Like i told hank,
i just want to help.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.060
Go home.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.062
I'll keep you posted.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.730
Bye, honey.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.672
I appreciate you
coming down, gina.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.974
Yeah, well,
i hate to say it,

10:08.976 --> 10:10.976
But i'm glad this case
is all yours now.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.144
Yeah?
We get that a lot.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.046
Hmm.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.617
Heard you went
through a split.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.052
Yeah,
you know how it is--

10:21.054 --> 10:23.288
The job,
long hours.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.990
I know too well.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.225
I'm actually going back
to my maiden name--

10:27.227 --> 10:29.361
Santos.

10:29.363 --> 10:32.230
Just waiting for the judge
to sign the papers.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.266
When you close this case,
let's grab a drink.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.945
[phone rings]

10:46.947 --> 10:48.246
Dawson.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.784
What do you mean
you sort of found the truck?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.127
(roman)
the missing box truck

11:02.129 --> 11:03.895
With the douglas company logo
was spotted

11:03.897 --> 11:05.163
Driving past
a red light camera

11:05.165 --> 11:06.965
Two blocks south
of that intersection.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.299
Seemed to just vanish
somehow

11:08.301 --> 11:12.070
Between this
three-block stretch.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.339
So the street's flanked
on one side by the river,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.074
On the other by
industrial buildings.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.709
It's pretty desolate.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.877
Everybody fan out.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.712
Check any building
with a garage.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.180
And grab
the infrared scanner.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.848
Got it.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.218
[coughs]

11:39.132 --> 11:41.733
You see what i see?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.168
Yep.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.009
(ruzek)
tell me that's not
what i think it is.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.484
Call the fire department.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.419
Tell them to bring a crane.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.932
.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.366
[chains rattling]

12:15.368 --> 12:17.068
[crowbar clangs]

12:37.190 --> 12:40.825
You ever do
a notification before?

12:40.827 --> 12:42.827
That's the one thing that

12:42.829 --> 12:46.231
I didn't want to learn
on this job.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.066
Let's take a ride.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.367
Yeah.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.012
[knocking on door]

13:08.021 --> 13:09.220
You sarah normark?

13:09.222 --> 13:10.221
Yes.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.456
Yeah,
i'm detective olinsky.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.824
This is officer ruzek.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.959
Tell me you found them.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.494
There's no easy way
to say this, ma'am--

13:16.496 --> 13:19.330
- Oh, god!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.799
[sarah crying]

13:20.801 --> 13:22.100
Come in.
Let's sit down.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.947
Where?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.115
The river, ma'am.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.151
[sobbing]

13:47.861 --> 13:51.162
Nothing i say
can offer you any solace.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.832
I know that.

13:53.834 --> 13:58.102
But we're gonna find
who did this to your family.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.538
(sarah)
how?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.408
How can a human being

14:03.410 --> 14:06.845
Do that to another
human being?

14:11.451 --> 14:14.619
Some men...

14:14.621 --> 14:17.555
Just don't belong
walking the earth.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.433
I got it.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.105
Who's your partner?

14:34.107 --> 14:35.373
I want a name.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.442
Uh--
i--

14:37.444 --> 14:39.377
I-i want--
i want a lawyer.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.411
Oh, yeah?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.280
Or--or a deal?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.348
(voight)
oh.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.150
- Or a...
- What's his name?

14:46.152 --> 14:47.185
Can i help you?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.486
Yeah, a little boy
just died.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.355
He's gonna answer
some questions, all right?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.556
You can see
he's in no shape--

14:51.558 --> 14:52.991
He's fine.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.260
(doctor)
you--hey, you--
you can't do this.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.661
Hey!

15:00.600 --> 15:02.400
Here?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.640
[grunts]

15:13.580 --> 15:15.546
You awake now?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.916
Okay.
Okay!

15:17.918 --> 15:20.118
What's his name?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.119
Jared.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.587
Give me a last name.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.589
Miko!

15:24.591 --> 15:27.058
Jared miko!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.327
Where do i find him?

15:29.329 --> 15:31.262
He crashes at a motel

15:31.264 --> 15:32.664
Up on ogden.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.300
You can tell it's him
from the dye on his face.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.401
Come on!

15:44.311 --> 15:45.710
I should call the vice
when we're done,

15:48.515 --> 15:49.598
Have them come get their quotas
for the month.

15:49.599 --> 15:50.682
(voight on phone)
first things first.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.216
[electronic chiming]

15:52.218 --> 15:55.086
Got stats on miko--
just came in over the wire.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.287
Gimme.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.523
Jared miko--he's got a long list
of violent priors,

15:58.525 --> 16:02.026
And he's wanted on a parole
violation in california.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.264
Baby, she means nothing to me,
i'm telling you.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.532
Come back to the room
tonight.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.506
It's him.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.418
Room 23.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.663
We've been made.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.266
[gunshots]

16:42.268 --> 16:43.401
[woman screaming]

16:43.403 --> 16:44.535
Get down!

16:44.537 --> 16:46.537
Police!
Get down!

16:46.539 --> 16:48.206
Go around the back!

16:51.778 --> 16:53.378
[grunts]

16:56.316 --> 16:57.648
[grunting]

17:07.761 --> 17:09.260
Ahh!

17:14.034 --> 17:16.267
Ahh!

17:20.106 --> 17:21.271
Don't move!

17:21.273 --> 17:23.207
Stay down!

17:23.209 --> 17:24.275
You okay?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.576
I'll live.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.514
Ooh.
What's this?

17:29.516 --> 17:31.049
I found it under my bed.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.417
Lucky you.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.553
You gonna read me my rights,
officer?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.588
You got the wrong guy.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.798
.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.232
(voight)
it's a hell of a stain you tried
scrubbing off there, slick.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.367
You know, you didn't
have to kill

17:49.369 --> 17:50.768
That little boy
and his dad.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.539
Could have just parked
that truck and walked away.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.274
What's anyone
ever done for me?

17:56.276 --> 17:59.243
Oh, i can tell you what
we're gonna do for you.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.813
We're gonna make sure
you wind up buried

18:01.815 --> 18:05.283
Inside prison walls.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.819
It was that moving company lady,
wasn't it?

18:07.821 --> 18:09.187
What?

18:09.189 --> 18:11.222
Yeah, what'd she
call herself?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.590
Bunny?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.627
That bitch.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.564
Vosh was paying her double
to get a truck.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.300
She gets greedy
and hits him up for triple.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.535
He says no,

18:24.537 --> 18:28.506
And she gets a conscience,
goes to the cops?

18:28.508 --> 18:29.841
Is that it?

18:29.843 --> 18:32.643
So you're saying she knew
what you were up to?

18:32.645 --> 18:36.180
As long as bunny got hers,
she never questioned it.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.485
(voight)
wait a second.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.820
You're saying that
you think you're here

18:42.822 --> 18:47.191
'cause of some cashier
at a moving company?

18:53.600 --> 18:57.435
You're here
'cause we caught you.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.570
I can do this all night.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.743
I see a nice spot for you
on the floor in there.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.778
I've seen worse places.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.386
Too bad you missed chow.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.755
But i hear they got
great oatmeal at 26th and cal.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.357
Sleep tight.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.728
Erin--

19:23.730 --> 19:25.596
Before you speak, think hard
about what you're gonna say.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.498
Look, i don't know what
that guy told you--

19:27.500 --> 19:30.635
More than you.

19:30.637 --> 19:35.239
Maybe i knew
about the reward.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.507
You should have seen

19:36.509 --> 19:38.776
What we pulled
out of the river today.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.778
If you had come
to us sooner,

19:40.780 --> 19:43.881
We could have avoided
a lot of carnage.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.516
None of that is my fault,
erin.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.186
How many times in your life
have you said that?

19:48.188 --> 19:49.187
[scoffs]

19:49.189 --> 19:50.621
Fine, okay,
beat up on mom,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.590
But remember, i am the one
that came to you--

19:52.592 --> 19:54.492
Yes or no?

19:56.396 --> 20:00.331
Did you know what
they were up to?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.435
Absolutely not.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.444
(johnny)
look, i knew bunny had skeletons
when i married her, but--

20:13.446 --> 20:14.712
(voight)
what kind of skeletons?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.348
Maxed credit cards,
a car note.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.984
That's every marriage.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.720
What does she
really owe?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.957
A guy on cicero,
an old boyfriend,

20:25.959 --> 20:27.725
Screwed her over when
she got out of rehab--

20:27.727 --> 20:29.293
Gave her a life loan.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.262
How much?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.331
Bunny don't want to say,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.499
But he threatened to take
my business if she doesn't pay,

20:35.501 --> 20:37.535
So it's got to be a lot.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.841
(platt)
hey, you two.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.810
What are you hosting,
a battle of the bands?

20:45.812 --> 20:47.411
Fight broke out
at the metro.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.413
You know what i think of
when i look at them?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.715
Retirement.
Someplace far.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.283
Doesn't even
have to be warm.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.517
They'll grow out of it.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.653
You see that one there?

20:55.655 --> 20:58.322
He's 47.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.359
I got an order to deliver
jared miko to central detention.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.261
He's got a date with
the judge for arraignment

21:03.263 --> 21:04.495
First thing in the morning.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.896
Handle it,
then wrap up shift.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.398
Will do.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.670
Miko, rise and shine.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.275
Come on, you got to get up
so we can cuff you.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.810
The old
pretending-to-sleep gag.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.445
Get up now!

21:23.616 --> 21:25.950
All right, everybody
face the wall.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.958
Come on. Get up.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.629
Hey, man, i'm not--

21:38.631 --> 21:41.999
Son of a bitch.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.335
We've got an escape!

21:44.337 --> 21:45.870
Looks like miko
had a razor blade

21:45.872 --> 21:47.972
Sewn in the waistband
of his tracksuit.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.408
He used it to slice off
the wristband

21:50.410 --> 21:52.743
And swapped it and his clothes
with the other prisoner

21:52.745 --> 21:54.378
After he snapped his neck.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.614
And what was the other prisoner
in for?

21:56.616 --> 21:57.915
Drunk and disorderly.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.984
He was sleeping it off.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.353
- Give us a minute, will you?
- Yeah.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.727
This whole thing,
miko getting cut loose,

22:09.729 --> 22:10.895
That's on my watch.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.563
It's on me, hank.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.833
Look, i'm not gonna play
any blame games, trudy.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.768
I don't think anyone
thinks any less of you.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.503
Commander fisher's
on his way in.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.038
I'm not gonna hear
the end of it.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.407
Well, there's your penance.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.445
Come on.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.980
All right,
listen up.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.683
Got an offender
who escaped custody.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.119
Jared miko.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.987
Armed or not,

22:36.989 --> 22:40.124
He's considered
extremely dangerous.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.127
He was mistakenly processed out
about an hour ago

22:43.129 --> 22:46.864
After assuming the identity
of another prisoner he killed.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.633
We checked the booking photo
of that prisoner,

22:49.635 --> 22:51.435
And miko now has his clothes.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.704
He's dressed in dark jeans
and a gray sweater,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.106
But most importantly,

22:55.108 --> 22:59.110
Look for the dye pack stain
on the right side of his face.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.611
All right,
i want you to check

23:00.613 --> 23:02.012
Every abandoned building,
park,

23:02.014 --> 23:04.148
Train, bus stop
in this district.

23:04.150 --> 23:08.085
You bring this animal
back through those doors...

23:08.087 --> 23:09.620
Breathing or not.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.030
(burgess)
you think platt could get
suspended over this?

23:20.032 --> 23:22.767
After that piece in
the <i> sun-times,</i> no way.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.034
It doesn't look good
for any of us

23:24.036 --> 23:25.536
If we don't get miko back.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.037
(woman on police radio)
units citywide,

23:27.039 --> 23:28.639
We have a call
of an aggravated battery

23:28.641 --> 23:29.891
At belmont and sheridan.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.142
A cabdriver was beaten
by an offender

23:31.144 --> 23:33.611
Fitting the description of
a white male wanted for escape.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.013
Dispatch, does the description
include a gray sweater?

23:36.015 --> 23:38.849
(woman)
affirmative.
Suspect was in a gray sweater.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.419
Unit 21-13, we are en route
to that location.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.694
Sir, what happened?

23:50.696 --> 23:52.163
Look at me.
That's what happened.

23:52.165 --> 23:54.498
This the fare who rolled you?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.834
He didn't want to pay, so i went
after him with a mini-bat.

23:56.836 --> 23:57.902
That's not too smart.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.603
I need to hear it from you?

23:59.605 --> 24:01.505
I'm out of a fare,
and he took my lucky cubs bat.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.507
Did you see which way
he went?

24:03.509 --> 24:05.643
Was too busy
looking for my teeth.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.680
(burgess)
wanted offender
positively identified.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.215
Fled on foot
and is still at large

24:11.217 --> 24:13.117
At the 1200 block
of belmont.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.518
I need you
to stay right here.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.953
Paper car's coming.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.492
I told you everything.

24:21.494 --> 24:24.929
Who's miko gonna see
up on belmont?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.597
I don't know.

24:26.599 --> 24:29.600
Well, your partner
escaped from custody,

24:29.602 --> 24:31.235
Then jacked a ride uptown.

24:31.237 --> 24:34.905
Belmont and sheridan,
what's he doing there?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.207
[sighs]

24:36.209 --> 24:38.809
Getting high one night,
i told miko about my old man.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.811
What about him?

24:40.813 --> 24:43.013
I stash my cut at his place.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.049
$280,000.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.917
Miko's going after it.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.186
What's the address?

24:49.188 --> 24:53.924
Oakwood towers,
400 belmont street east.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.163
Please don't let him
kill my old man.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.498
He's good people.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.866
He didn't know
i stashed it there.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.168
And here, i thought
there was honor among thieves.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.947
.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.748
(voight over radio)
it's vosh's dad. Apartment 812.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.151
Got it.
Apartment 812.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.753
Let's go.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.063
Let's go.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.967
Please, no more.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.235
It's okay.
We're the police.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.570
You all right?
You okay?

25:39.572 --> 25:40.638
- This...
- Clear!

25:40.640 --> 25:42.907
Big guy kept asking
where the money was.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.675
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.310
He grabbed a bag
from the closet.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.811
It belonged to my son.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.880
He just left.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.782
Be advised,
suspect still in the building.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.317
You know your son
was part of a robbery crew?

25:53.319 --> 25:55.219
He was hiding
his money here.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.787
Oh, nick.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.189
I thought he was doing good
on parole.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.674
Whoa! Oh!

26:00.675 --> 26:02.158
The guy--he's down there
fighting with security.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.327
Go, go!

26:09.235 --> 26:11.802
[gunshots]

26:11.804 --> 26:14.672
Get back!

26:14.674 --> 26:16.206
10-1, 10-1,
shots fired in the basement.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.174

26:17.176 --> 26:20.578
[gunfire]

26:20.580 --> 26:22.713
Miko took off!
Let's go!

26:29.255 --> 26:31.088
Miko,
there's no way out of here!

26:31.090 --> 26:32.723
You're surrounded!

26:34.360 --> 26:35.859
There's a light switch.

26:35.861 --> 26:36.860
- Let's hit it.
- Got it.

26:36.862 --> 26:37.895
Go.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.134
You all right?

26:44.136 --> 26:45.202
Yeah.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.637
He took off
down the hallway.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.006
You okay?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.074
I'm good.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.609
Let's split up.
We'll cut him off.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.377
Let's--let's go this way.
Come on.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.678
Stay close.
Okay?

26:54.680 --> 26:55.746
Mm-hmm.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.314
All right,
one, two...

27:04.790 --> 27:06.857
- Dead?
- Yeah.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.144
Could be anywhere in here.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.179
So watch your back.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.362
(man)
get down!

27:45.364 --> 27:48.399
[gunfire]

27:49.869 --> 27:52.169
Go!

27:52.171 --> 27:55.205
[gunfire]

27:59.045 --> 28:00.444
Move out!

28:02.682 --> 28:03.981
(lindsay)
adam?

28:11.023 --> 28:14.091
[tires squeal]

28:24.403 --> 28:25.936
[grunts]

28:30.342 --> 28:33.410
[grunting]

28:41.120 --> 28:43.153
[handcuffs clicking]

28:43.155 --> 28:44.855
Tight enough for you?

28:47.159 --> 28:48.492
(man)
get up!

28:51.330 --> 28:54.398
[chuckling]

29:02.775 --> 29:04.842
[siren wails]

29:16.021 --> 29:17.054
Let's go.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.789
(reporter)
statement, officer?

29:18.791 --> 29:20.758
(reporter)
miko, you want to make
a statement?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.459
[indistinct shouting]

29:22.461 --> 29:24.094
Welcome back.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.997
Got out once.
I'll do it again.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.299
[gunshot]

29:29.301 --> 29:30.968
Hey! Hey!

29:30.970 --> 29:33.971
[all shouting]

29:35.174 --> 29:36.373
You got it?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.841
Got it!

29:48.988 --> 29:50.721
.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.455
His escape...

29:52.458 --> 29:54.191
It was all over the news,

29:54.193 --> 29:58.061
And when i saw
that you caught him,

29:58.063 --> 30:00.564
I couldn't--

30:00.566 --> 30:02.366
I didn't want him to--

30:02.368 --> 30:04.101
You don't have to explain.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.874
I'm not sorry.

30:20.986 --> 30:25.989
What you said earlier,

30:25.991 --> 30:28.992
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.296
What's that?

30:32.298 --> 30:36.033
"some men don't deserve

30:36.035 --> 30:38.368
To be walking the earth."

30:52.451 --> 30:54.351
Ma'am...

30:54.353 --> 30:55.485
[clears throat]

30:55.487 --> 30:57.554
We have to put you
in lockup

30:57.556 --> 31:00.224
Until we can get you
in front of a judge.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.458
It's okay.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.996
I'd be happy to
wait with you,

31:05.998 --> 31:07.397
If you want.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.433
- All right?
- Thank you.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.871
- Come on.
- Yeah.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.554
[knock on door]

31:30.556 --> 31:33.123
You two.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.194
Commander.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.363
In order to process
a reward,

31:39.365 --> 31:41.899
Check exchange management
insisted on reading

31:41.901 --> 31:43.567
All the statements
in the case.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.136
Because of bunny's involvement
with the offenders,

31:46.138 --> 31:48.538
They're not only gonna
refuse her the reward;

31:48.540 --> 31:51.074
They threatened to press charges
against her.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.945
Based on an interview
with a homicidal career felon?

31:54.947 --> 31:56.914
I talked the check exchange
out of it,

31:56.916 --> 32:00.117
But if you want to fight
for the reward, be my guest.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.119
I don't think the superintendant
will go to bat

32:02.121 --> 32:04.388
When you explain you're
attempting to get a payment

32:04.390 --> 32:06.123
For your mother

32:06.125 --> 32:10.260
Who's got a sheet
all her own.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.529
Nice work on the case,
though.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.538
[sighs]

32:21.540 --> 32:24.141
That poor woman.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.009
(bunny)
i can't imagine how she feels.

32:26.011 --> 32:29.012
Losing her husband,
her son...

32:29.014 --> 32:31.014
You can stop now.

32:31.016 --> 32:34.184
There's no money, mom.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.419
What do you mean?

32:35.421 --> 32:37.187
The reward.

32:37.189 --> 32:41.992
The check cashing company
thinks that you were complicit.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.627
Complicit?

32:43.629 --> 32:46.730
I helped you find
those bastards.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.632
I deserve
that reward money.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.068
This is--
this is voight, isn't it?

32:51.070 --> 32:52.536
He'll do anything
to punish me,

32:52.538 --> 32:54.271
And you are going
right along with it.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.140
You should have been
straight with me.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.276
What did you say
to them?

32:59.278 --> 33:00.610
Got a call.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.713
Organized crime needs our help
on some surveillance.

33:02.715 --> 33:05.582
Why don't you grab halstead
and go?

33:05.584 --> 33:06.683
Hank...

33:06.685 --> 33:08.552
You're still
on the clock.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.489
I'll make sure
bunny gets home.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.257
We'll talk later.

33:21.467 --> 33:25.235
It's bad enough you drag
your daughter into this,

33:25.237 --> 33:29.172
But you really think
you can get one over on me?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.474
I need that money, hank.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.541
Yeah, i know.

33:31.543 --> 33:35.078
Johnny told me all about it.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.480
Who do you owe?

33:36.482 --> 33:38.248
[sighs]

33:39.618 --> 33:42.519
Tommy o'neil.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.755
That pimp from cicero?

33:44.757 --> 33:47.224
About a year ago,
i borrowed some money from him

33:47.226 --> 33:51.028
Just to get on my feet,

33:51.030 --> 33:54.564
And he said that he would
do things to me

33:54.566 --> 33:58.201
And johnny
if i didn't pay.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.206
What do you owe?

34:05.477 --> 34:06.743
[sighs]

34:06.745 --> 34:08.779
A lot.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.560
That your dinner?

34:23.562 --> 34:24.561
Yeah.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.196
Got to hurry.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.266
On my way to the library.
I got to cram for this test.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.471
You all right, sarge?

34:34.473 --> 34:36.739
Hasn't been the best shift
of my career.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.810
You know what?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.116
Going through my
history of penology book,

34:46.118 --> 34:49.853
And i found this...

34:49.855 --> 34:52.322
Here it is.

34:52.324 --> 34:56.126
"last year alone,
6,536 convicts escaped

34:56.128 --> 34:58.462
Or went awol from jails and
prisons in the united states."

34:58.464 --> 35:01.798
I don't need you to make me
feel better, nadia.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.866
[sighs]

35:02.868 --> 35:04.267
I know.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.536
Just saying jared miko
wasn't the first jailbreak

35:06.538 --> 35:08.605
In american history.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.707
Won't be the last.

35:10.709 --> 35:14.177
Could have been you or anyone
at that desk when it happened.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.184
You taking the bus?

35:21.186 --> 35:22.886
Yeah, got to hurry.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.456
Transfer at harlem.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.423
Well, i'm getting out
of here anyway, so come on.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.891
I'll give you a ride.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.797
I'm glad you decided
to call.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.831
[sighs]

35:34.833 --> 35:36.216
After this case,

35:36.217 --> 35:37.600
It seemed like a good idea
to get out.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.336
Yeah.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.173
Believe it or not,

35:43.175 --> 35:45.742
This place used to be the spot
back in the day.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.478
My old sergeant
used to tell us

35:48.480 --> 35:50.614
How he'd bring
his dates here;

35:50.616 --> 35:52.315
They'd order the lobster
and load it up

35:52.317 --> 35:54.317
With that famous egg sauce.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.453
He swore it was
a surefire aphrodisiac,

35:56.455 --> 35:57.754
And it never failed.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.589
Oh, in that case,
two orders, please.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.659
[chuckles]

36:03.662 --> 36:05.595
You remember
that undercover job

36:05.597 --> 36:08.832
We worked at that dance club
that one time?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.834
Yeah, i do.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.236
It's a good bust.

36:13.238 --> 36:16.740
Even better party.

36:16.742 --> 36:20.177
Hey,
wait a minute.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.712
I know i apologized for
coming on to you that night.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.282
Is that where
this is going?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.217
I liked it.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.718
[chuckles]

36:28.720 --> 36:31.755
You threw your drink
in my face.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.758
Well,

36:34.760 --> 36:36.927
I had to play the role.

37:02.754 --> 37:05.889
[keypad beeping]

37:05.891 --> 37:06.923
[lock clanks]

37:11.530 --> 37:14.998
50¢ on the dollar.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.601
That's 15k.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.337
Bunny owes 30.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.806
What's she paying you now?

37:22.808 --> 37:24.541
200 a week.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.643
Not even covering the vig.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.846
So a 15k buyout
sounds like progress.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.420
Make it 20.

37:37.422 --> 37:41.358
You gonna slap her around?
Break her husband's legs?

37:41.360 --> 37:43.793
I don't think so.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.307
[sighs]

37:57.309 --> 37:59.442
You know,
you walk in here

37:59.444 --> 38:02.479
Telling me
to take a cut rate

38:02.481 --> 38:06.416
Like your star means
something in cicero.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.725
One or both of them
might get to me

38:15.727 --> 38:18.528
But not before
i lay you out on the floor.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.550
You know,
someone told me once--

38:40.552 --> 38:44.354
Maybe i read it somewhere--

38:44.356 --> 38:45.889
Never get into bed
with a woman

38:45.891 --> 38:50.493
Whose problems are worse
than your own.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.095
Next time then.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.974
All right,
you're square.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.746
All of it?

39:09.748 --> 39:12.115
Yeah, i bought your debt.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.984
Which means now
you owe me,

39:14.986 --> 39:17.987
And you're gonna repay me
by staying out of erin's life

39:17.989 --> 39:19.489
As of tonight.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.891
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

39:21.893 --> 39:24.761
Turn me into a pariah
like you did all those years.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.596
That was your own doing,
bunny.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.732
I wanted to see erin.
I wanted to spend time with her.

39:28.734 --> 39:29.999
You wouldn't let me.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.551
You know how many times

39:31.552 --> 39:33.102
You've reached out to her
in ten years?

39:33.105 --> 39:34.838
Twice.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.408
And both times, you were
coming down off of smack.

39:38.410 --> 39:42.078
To protect you, i wouldn't
let her see you that way.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.747
Okay, you win, hank.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.482
You were the
better parent.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.484
That's what you want to hear,
isn't it?

39:48.653 --> 39:51.454
You are not gonna keep her
out of my life.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.995
[cell phone buzzing]

40:00.399 --> 40:02.565
Yeah, what's up?

40:02.567 --> 40:06.136
(lindsay on phone)
thank you.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.200
[engine turns over]

41:18.910 --> 41:21.945
[wolf howls]

41:22.305 --> 41:28.754
