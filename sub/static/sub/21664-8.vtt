00:00.227 --> 00:01.861
- If Jenny knew you
enjoyed doing her chores,

00:01.960 --> 00:04.570
she wouldn't call it blackmail.

00:05.094 --> 00:07.327
- Drop everything.

00:08.246 --> 00:09.213
- Hello, Jenny Gaines.

00:09.392 --> 00:10.392
Your chores are being completed.

00:10.492 --> 00:11.892
Everything is in order.

00:11.992 --> 00:14.325
Except I can't seem to find
this sock's duplicate.

00:14.425 --> 00:15.225
- Don't worry about it.

00:15.325 --> 00:16.225
Mom's coming.

00:16.325 --> 00:17.825
Stop doing my chores.

00:17.925 --> 00:19.425
- But a missing sock
is illogical.

00:19.525 --> 00:20.859
Where'd it go?

00:20.959 --> 00:23.025
- Nobody knows.
Socks go missing all the time.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.225
It's one of the great
mysteries of the world.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.392
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

00:26.492 --> 00:27.892
See?

00:29.459 --> 00:30.392
- Hi, guys.

00:30.492 --> 00:32.825
I've got lunch for everybody.

00:32.925 --> 00:35.292
I thought that I would treat...

00:35.392 --> 00:37.592
Jenny, is that you cleaning?

00:37.692 --> 00:39.392
- Pretty sweet, huh?

00:39.492 --> 00:41.725
And I'm doing it all by myself.

00:41.825 --> 00:43.992
- You've never done a chore
in your life

00:44.092 --> 00:45.559
without me nagging you.

00:45.659 --> 00:47.225
- Looks like your little girl's
growing up

00:47.325 --> 00:49.692
and becoming more mature.

00:49.792 --> 00:52.259
- Are you wearing
two different colored socks?

00:52.359 --> 00:53.925
- It was conscious choice.

00:55.559 --> 00:57.659
- I have a question,

00:57.725 --> 00:59.992
strictly
for research purposes.

01:00.092 --> 01:01.325
Do you care for me?

01:01.425 --> 01:03.059
- Do you want me
to care for you?

01:03.159 --> 01:04.459
- As I suspected.

01:04.559 --> 01:06.259
Frankie doesn't love Sigourney.

01:06.359 --> 01:07.659
She's gone soft.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.992
She's become attached

01:09.092 --> 01:10.825
and only thinks
Frankie loves her.

01:10.925 --> 01:13.359
- According to my program,
love is a sign of weakness.

01:13.459 --> 01:14.492
- That's right.

01:14.659 --> 01:15.925
And Sigourney's weakness
will be the key

01:16.025 --> 01:19.492
to getting rid of Frankie
once and for all.

01:19.659 --> 01:21.059
- Do you want me to destroy her?

01:21.159 --> 01:22.425
- There's no need.

01:22.525 --> 01:24.092
Sigourney will destroy her
for me.

01:25.725 --> 01:28.859
Now, let's test out
that shoulder.

01:28.959 --> 01:29.992
Ow.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.459
Now come on. Ow.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.825
- I am very sorry,
if you want me to be.

01:33.925 --> 01:35.559
- Apologizes are for the weak.

01:35.659 --> 01:38.225
Still, try to be more careful.

01:43.992 --> 01:47.492
- I cannot stop thinking
about this sock.

01:47.659 --> 01:50.025
- Frankie, stop,
you're obsessing.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.092
- My processing
functions differently.

01:52.192 --> 01:54.759
Everything must logically
compute, and this does not.

01:58.259 --> 02:01.259
- Socks are physical objects,
thus they cannot disappear.

02:01.359 --> 02:04.025
Therefore it must be somewhere
within the premises.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.959
I will thoroughly organize
and clean the entire house.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.992
- Forget it. It'll take hours.

02:08.092 --> 02:10.425
And sometimes
you don't find it anywhere.

02:17.192 --> 02:18.225
- Found it.

02:18.325 --> 02:20.325
- Now you should unfind it.

02:20.425 --> 02:22.492
That thing is disgusting.

02:22.659 --> 02:24.259
- My sock!

02:24.359 --> 02:25.359
- What's going on here?

02:25.459 --> 02:26.792
- And what's that smell?

02:26.892 --> 02:31.259
- Mom... I saw the pride in
your eyes when I was cleaning,

02:31.359 --> 02:35.459
and I thought, "Hey, let's keep
the train rolling."

02:35.559 --> 02:36.792
Come on.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.092
- Something strange
is happening.

02:40.192 --> 02:41.959
- Here we go.

02:42.059 --> 02:45.059
It's just that you're always
suspicious of something.

02:45.159 --> 02:48.659
- Will, look at the leaves
on this plant.

02:48.725 --> 02:50.292
- Oh, super shiny.

02:50.392 --> 02:51.392
- Exactly.

02:51.492 --> 02:53.192
They've been polished.

02:53.292 --> 02:56.092
Something is fishy.

02:59.025 --> 03:01.859
- Frankie, thanks
for organizing my locker.

03:01.959 --> 03:05.025
Whoa, is that passionfruit?

03:09.659 --> 03:12.225
You know, he keeps
asking about you.

03:12.325 --> 03:15.059
- If I ask you to tell him
that I'm asking about him,

03:15.159 --> 03:18.392
does that defy Mom's directive
to stay away from him?

03:18.492 --> 03:20.559
- Confusing, yes.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.425
Defiant, no.

03:23.525 --> 03:25.025
- Good day, my ladies.

03:25.125 --> 03:29.092
- Robbie, uh, how long have you
been standing there?

03:29.192 --> 03:31.659
- Long enough to hear Frankie
ask you if it's defiant for her

03:31.725 --> 03:33.959
to ask you to tell Cole
she's asking about him.

03:36.192 --> 03:39.159
- Do you need something
or are you just saying hi?

03:39.259 --> 03:40.959
- Actually, I was wondering
if you two

03:41.059 --> 03:45.459
could give me your thoughts...
on my graphic novel.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.259
- Oh, would you
look at that, Frankie.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.825
He named it after us.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.125
- Untrue. It's 100% fictional.

03:52.225 --> 03:55.725
- "The Adventures
of Drankie and Fayton."

03:55.825 --> 03:58.559
Do those names sound familiar?

03:58.659 --> 04:00.925
- Not to me.
- I'd be happy to read it,

04:01.025 --> 04:02.759
but it will have to be
in the near future.

04:02.859 --> 04:04.359
We have to go to class now.

04:06.192 --> 04:09.892
- Well, it was nice seeing you.

04:09.992 --> 04:12.025
Bye.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:23.359 --> 04:27.492
- Name the king of England
during the American Revolution?

04:27.659 --> 04:29.659
- Please, that's child's play.

04:29.725 --> 04:31.292
King George III.

04:31.392 --> 04:33.225
Next?

04:35.325 --> 04:37.125
I said next.

04:37.225 --> 04:38.859
- The longest recorded flight
of a chicken

04:38.959 --> 04:40.492
was how many seconds?

04:40.659 --> 04:43.725
- What kind of question is that?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.825
Is that toilet paper?

04:45.925 --> 04:48.225
Where are
the Genius Test flashcards?

04:48.325 --> 04:49.859
- I lost 'em.

04:49.959 --> 04:52.992
But this trivia toilet paper
is the next best thing.

04:53.092 --> 04:56.092
- Tammy, not to question
your leadership,

04:56.192 --> 05:00.459
but shouldn't you
be quizzing us?

05:00.559 --> 05:03.792
- Yeah, you're not even
in this week's competition.

05:03.892 --> 05:05.492
You're an alternate.

05:05.659 --> 05:07.025
- For now.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.959
But I have feeling
Little Miss Frankie

05:10.059 --> 05:12.659
won't be able to take part
in the competition.

05:12.692 --> 05:16.092
Let's just say she may
get caught with a cheat sheet

05:16.192 --> 05:19.059
after someone anonymously
tips off the judges.

05:22.925 --> 05:24.392
- What are you doing in here?

05:31.225 --> 05:33.525
â™ª Never felt so alive

05:42.456 --> 05:44.423
- I was trying
to skip out on math class

05:44.590 --> 05:45.956
and catch up on some sleep.

05:46.056 --> 05:49.256
- So you slept through
what I just said, right?

05:49.356 --> 05:51.156
- Uh, you mean the part about
someone getting caught

05:51.256 --> 05:53.923
with a cheat sheet after
someone else tips them off?

05:54.023 --> 05:55.823
Yeah, I slept through that.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.090
- Phew, that was close.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.456
- I know how this works.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.856
I'm prepared to offer you
a month's worth

06:02.956 --> 06:05.256
of math homework
to keep your mouth shut.

06:05.356 --> 06:07.023
- Ouch.
You don't even know my name,

06:07.123 --> 06:09.656
and you already have me pegged
as a tattletale?

06:09.756 --> 06:11.890
Andrew, I'm new around here.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.190
- I'm Tammy.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.356
- Relax, Tammy,
your secret's safe with me.

06:15.456 --> 06:17.823
I'm sure you have a good reason
for doing what you're doing.

06:17.923 --> 06:18.956
- Really?

06:19.056 --> 06:21.123
I mean, I do.

06:21.223 --> 06:23.956
- Yeah, and I'm sure whoever
you're doing it to deserves it.

06:24.056 --> 06:25.923
- She does.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.056
Wait. You should come

06:32.156 --> 06:34.056
to our Brain Squad competition
this week.

06:34.156 --> 06:36.723
I'm the captain, Lucia
and Makayla are on the team.

06:36.823 --> 06:38.190
And I don't know
if you met John,

06:38.290 --> 06:42.490
but it's him,
Bryon, and Frankie.

06:42.590 --> 06:44.090
- Uh, Frankie?

06:44.190 --> 06:45.956
- Unfortunately, yes.

06:46.056 --> 06:47.990
Even the name gives me chills.

06:51.723 --> 06:53.923
- All clear.

06:54.023 --> 06:55.823
What is it? Is it Robbie?

06:55.923 --> 06:57.723
Where is he?
Quick, back under the table!

06:57.823 --> 07:00.956
- No, look.

07:01.056 --> 07:03.190
- I think we should
go talk to them.

07:04.856 --> 07:06.723
- Frankie doesn't
wanna talk to me.

07:06.823 --> 07:08.056
I'm gonna sit right here

07:08.156 --> 07:09.590
and not draw any attention
to myself.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.590
- You should totally
go talk to Dayton though.

07:13.656 --> 07:16.156
- Okay, cool.

07:16.256 --> 07:17.390
- Where are you going?

07:17.490 --> 07:19.156
- You said I should
go talk to Dayton.

07:19.256 --> 07:21.723
- Dude, it's guy code.

07:21.823 --> 07:23.123
I can tell you to go,

07:23.223 --> 07:25.590
but you're not supposed
to leave a brother in need.

07:25.690 --> 07:26.623
- Come with me then.

07:26.723 --> 07:27.890
Show a little initiative.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.823
Grab the bull by the horns.

07:29.923 --> 07:33.623
Seize the day and take...
- Fine!

07:33.723 --> 07:35.456
Let's do it.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.256
What... what
are you doing?

07:42.356 --> 07:44.756
- Connecting to the school's
central time clock,

07:44.856 --> 07:46.356
so I can escape Cole.

07:57.823 --> 08:01.623
- Wow, Robbie's comic
is actually really good.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.490
- May I read it?

08:12.123 --> 08:13.090
Very impressive.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.590
His characters have great depth.

08:14.656 --> 08:19.923
- Um, so you noticed that
Drankie is a robot in the comic?

08:20.023 --> 08:24.256
And her best friend Fayton
is a human girl?

08:24.356 --> 08:27.256
And what about
Fayton's brother Dole?

08:27.356 --> 08:30.656
Hello, you don't think
that's a little odd?

08:32.190 --> 08:34.590
- That's it, I'm calling Cole
so you two can sort this out.

08:34.690 --> 08:36.323
- No! Mom says I can't.

08:36.423 --> 08:39.390
My system is designed
to follow commands.

08:39.490 --> 08:42.990
But it is making me
feel... funny.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.923
- I get it, you're sad.

08:45.023 --> 08:47.390
But it just gets worst
to dwell on it.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.023
Do you know how I deal with it?

08:49.123 --> 08:50.690
- Save thousands of pictures
of pugs and pandas

08:50.790 --> 08:51.990
to your hard drive?

08:52.090 --> 08:54.123
- No. Is that
what you... never mind.

08:54.223 --> 08:57.390
I like to squeeze a pillow
as hard as I can

08:57.490 --> 08:59.256
to get the bad feelings
out of my system.

09:01.856 --> 09:03.290
- Drink?

09:04.956 --> 09:06.590
- Ow!

09:06.656 --> 09:07.790
That's super-hot.

09:07.890 --> 09:09.656
- Yeah, it's tea.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.256
- Very funny, Dayton.

09:11.356 --> 09:12.856
But we have an issue.

09:12.956 --> 09:14.490
Mom may be onto us.

09:14.590 --> 09:17.156
- Maybe you should go back
to doing your own chores.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.756
- I have a better idea.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.256
Nobody does them for a while.

09:20.356 --> 09:21.990
That way Mom will know
it's me not doing them.

09:22.090 --> 09:25.023
- Either way, at least Frankie
won't have to do them anymore.

09:25.123 --> 09:26.756
- Oh, we're not done.

09:26.856 --> 09:28.223
It's just a temporary break.

09:28.323 --> 09:29.623
In the meantime,

09:29.723 --> 09:31.756
we'll shift the blackmail
in another direction.

09:31.856 --> 09:32.723
Carry me home.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.856
Oh hey, girls.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.123
- What's up?

09:43.223 --> 09:45.090
- Well, Jenny, sweetie,
since you've been doing

09:45.190 --> 09:47.390
such a great job cleaning,
I was wondering

09:47.490 --> 09:49.923
if maybe you could do
some yardwork, too.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.056
And the garbage bins are filthy.

09:53.156 --> 09:54.890
- You hear that, Frankie?

09:54.990 --> 09:57.323
Mom wants me to do
some yardwork.

09:57.423 --> 09:59.823
Looks like it's back to chores.

09:59.923 --> 10:02.256
For me, that is.

10:02.356 --> 10:04.290
- Let's see her wiggle
out of this one.

10:04.390 --> 10:05.823
- Um, hun, do you notice

10:05.923 --> 10:06.956
anything different
about Frankie?

10:07.056 --> 10:08.223
- No.

10:08.323 --> 10:09.990
- Well, she always says hi

10:10.090 --> 10:13.090
and gives us a smile
when she comes home.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.623
Maybe she's just
having a bad day.

10:14.723 --> 10:17.056
- She's an android,
she doesn't have bad days.

10:17.156 --> 10:18.756
- Well, I think she does.

10:18.856 --> 10:20.723
I hope it doesn't have anything
to do with Cole.

10:20.823 --> 10:21.756
- That's ridiculous.

10:21.856 --> 10:23.356
I didn't build her to be mad.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.390
What?

10:24.490 --> 10:27.590
Hey, Frankie,
how was school today?

10:27.690 --> 10:29.556
Seems fine to me.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.456
Oh, she's just
fluffing it, right?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.208
- What you doing?
- Studying.

10:47.308 --> 10:48.908
- Oh, cool, mind if I join you?

10:49.008 --> 10:50.341
- Sure.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.575
Sorry.

11:04.075 --> 11:04.975
- Really?

11:05.075 --> 11:06.675
- I'm done, promise.

11:12.975 --> 11:14.808
- Alright, I'm taking a break.
- Great idea.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.675
Why isn't Frankie talking to me?

11:16.775 --> 11:18.908
Come on, Dayton,
you're my sister.

11:19.008 --> 11:20.441
We're supposed to be
on the same team.

11:20.541 --> 11:21.675
- We are, Cole.

11:21.775 --> 11:23.975
But I'm also on Frankie's team.

11:24.075 --> 11:25.608
- Sweet.
So you're playing both sides?

11:25.775 --> 11:27.375
- I'm not choosing sides.

11:27.475 --> 11:29.008
There's a difference.

11:29.108 --> 11:32.375
Look, if it makes you feel
any better, it's not Frankie.

11:32.475 --> 11:35.208
There's someone else.

11:35.308 --> 11:36.141
- It's Andrew, isn't it?

11:36.241 --> 11:37.275
Uh, I knew it.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.075
- It's her mom.
- I knew it... wait, what?

11:39.175 --> 11:42.475
- She's protective about
who Frankie hangs out with.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.641
Especially when it's some guy
who didn't make

11:44.775 --> 11:47.675
the best impression by barging
into her house the other night.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.675
- She thinks
I'm some kind of delinquent.

11:51.575 --> 11:54.408
Dr. Gaines needs to know
the real me.

11:54.508 --> 11:57.375
Kind, caring,

11:57.475 --> 11:59.875
intelligent, sophisticated.

12:09.141 --> 12:10.775
- PEGS1, come over here

12:10.875 --> 12:14.841
and tell me if you notice
anything unusual.

12:14.941 --> 12:18.141
Why are the engineers
still afraid of them?

12:18.241 --> 12:19.508
- Very good question.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.475
You see, controlling them
has proven to be

12:21.575 --> 12:23.141
more difficult than expected.

12:23.241 --> 12:24.608
But take heart.

12:24.775 --> 12:27.041
All they need
is a few hardware tweaks.

12:27.141 --> 12:31.841
- Well, why isn't anyone
making these tweaks?

12:31.941 --> 12:35.175
Must I do everything here
by myself?

12:35.275 --> 12:36.775
Move.
- Mr. Kingston, sir,

12:36.808 --> 12:38.808
I wouldn't...
- Zip it!

12:38.908 --> 12:43.508
Alright, let's see,
let's start... ooh, ow.

12:43.608 --> 12:45.341
No, no, no, no!

12:51.475 --> 12:52.908
- It seems the prototypes

12:53.008 --> 12:55.208
have built-in
self-defense mechanisms.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.341
Very ingenious of Dr. Gaines,
wouldn't you say?

13:00.775 --> 13:04.308
- Are you sure you want to use
the word acerebral

13:04.408 --> 13:05.675
to describe yourself?

13:05.775 --> 13:07.641
- Um, it means intellectual.

13:07.775 --> 13:09.241
- It means brainless.

13:09.341 --> 13:12.808
- Yeah, let's go ahead
and take that one out.

13:12.908 --> 13:16.275
- "Dr. Gaines, if you'd give me
the chance to talk in person,

13:16.375 --> 13:19.308
"I could show you how I'm
a great guy and a great friend.

13:19.408 --> 13:21.041
Sincerely, Cole Reyes."

13:21.141 --> 13:22.875
Smiley face emoji.

13:22.975 --> 13:24.175
- Perfect.

13:24.275 --> 13:25.608
This is it, Dayton.

13:25.775 --> 13:28.675
If Dr. Gaines doesn't want me
talking to Frankie after this,

13:28.775 --> 13:30.608
maybe it just wasn't
meant to be.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.041
- Mm, I just got an email
from Cole Reyes.

13:40.141 --> 13:42.608
- Why would Cole Reyes
email you?

13:42.775 --> 13:45.341
- He wants to meet me
at a place called The Garage

13:45.441 --> 13:47.208
to talk about Frankie.

13:47.308 --> 13:48.808
- So not fair.

13:48.908 --> 13:50.575
How come you get to hang out
with Cole?

13:50.775 --> 13:52.941
- You should
totally hear him out.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.175
- I don't think
it's a good idea.

13:55.275 --> 13:58.608
Plus, why do I need to justify
myself to a 15-year-old?

13:58.775 --> 14:00.641
- That's why.

14:13.775 --> 14:16.641
- So, Tammy likes Cole,
but Cole likes Frankie?

14:16.775 --> 14:18.441
- Basically.

14:18.541 --> 14:19.975
- And Frankie likes Cole.

14:20.075 --> 14:22.175
But something happened, and now
she won't talk to him anymore?

14:22.275 --> 14:23.775
- Basically.
- Andrew.

14:23.808 --> 14:26.108
- What up, Tam Tam?

14:26.208 --> 14:27.775
Just a little nickname
I came up with.

14:27.841 --> 14:29.675
I do it for everyone I like.

14:29.775 --> 14:32.808
- I was wondering if
you're gonna make it

14:32.908 --> 14:34.508
to my Brain Squad competition.

14:34.608 --> 14:35.941
It should be quite the show.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.175
- Frankie.

14:37.275 --> 14:38.308
- Hello, Andrew Lapelier.

14:38.408 --> 14:39.275
- Tammy Gilroy.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.775
- John Travis.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.941
- Why don't you come walk
with Tam Tam and me?

14:44.508 --> 14:45.875
- Bad idea.

14:45.975 --> 14:47.608
- John, if you want people
to like you,

14:47.775 --> 14:48.575
you gotta make 'em jealous.

14:48.675 --> 14:50.041
- That doesn't sound right.

14:50.141 --> 14:53.175
- It is. I saw it on dating
show, and it has to be true.

14:53.275 --> 14:54.775
Watch and learn.

14:54.841 --> 14:56.941
Frankie Fresh.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.275
- Frankie has a nickname, too?

14:59.375 --> 15:00.608
- Sure.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.308
Aw, but don't worry, Tammy.

15:02.408 --> 15:03.408
Yours is way better.

15:03.508 --> 15:05.508
- I agree.

15:05.608 --> 15:06.508
- You do?

15:06.608 --> 15:07.975
- Yes.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.675
The rhythmic synchronization
of Tam Tam is more pleasing

15:09.775 --> 15:11.441
than the alliteration
of Frankie Fresh.

15:11.541 --> 15:12.841
- What's your deal?

15:12.941 --> 15:14.608
Do you think you should
just have all the guys?

15:14.775 --> 15:15.775
- What's going on?

15:15.875 --> 15:17.575
- Not really
any of your business, bro.

15:17.675 --> 15:19.775
- My friends
are beefing.

15:19.808 --> 15:22.908
So it is my business... bro.

15:23.008 --> 15:25.341
- By the way, sick sweater.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.175
- It's mine.

15:27.275 --> 15:28.775
- Then why don't you
take your sweater

15:28.808 --> 15:30.375
and go sweat someplace else?

15:30.475 --> 15:31.941
The big kids are talking.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.208
- The both of you, please,
stop arguing over me.

15:35.308 --> 15:36.508
- Boys, that's enough.

15:36.608 --> 15:39.808
Now retract your claws,
and everyone back to class.

15:39.908 --> 15:41.475
Except you, Cole.

15:41.575 --> 15:43.908
- Ha, see ya, Cole Slaw.

15:44.008 --> 15:46.241
And you, Andrew.

15:46.341 --> 15:48.775
- I'll see you both after school
in the Kiddy Cooler.

15:48.808 --> 15:50.775
- That's what she calls
detention.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.275
- And there you shall stay
until 6 p.m. today.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.275
- What?
No, Ms. Hough, not today...

15:55.375 --> 15:56.575
- And tomorrow.

15:56.675 --> 15:59.275
Would you like to go
for the triple?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.141
- No, Ms. Hough.

16:10.508 --> 16:12.541
- Frankie, hey.

16:12.641 --> 16:14.808
I just wanted to apologize.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.375
I was kind of a jerk earlier.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.541
I'm sorry.

16:17.641 --> 16:19.675
- Apology accepted, Andrew.

16:19.775 --> 16:21.041
Another illation.

16:21.141 --> 16:22.808
Apology accepted, Andrew.

16:22.908 --> 16:25.675
- So what's the deal
with you and Cole?

16:25.775 --> 16:26.875
- The deal?

16:26.975 --> 16:28.608
- Yeah, I mean,
what's the sitch?

16:28.775 --> 16:31.475
He was pretty quick to stick
his nose in our business today.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.775
Are you guys like a thing or...
- We are not a thing.

16:34.808 --> 16:37.375
It is possible the sitch
would be different,

16:37.475 --> 16:40.075
but my mom ordered me not
to hang out with him anymore.

16:40.175 --> 16:41.075
- Your mom?

16:41.175 --> 16:42.875
Ooh, wow.

16:42.975 --> 16:45.108
Well, anyways,
I should get in The Cooler.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.875
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

16:46.975 --> 16:48.075
No hard feelings?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.375
- Agreed.

17:07.241 --> 17:08.941
- Is that what I think it is?

17:09.040 --> 17:11.974
- Uh, Lucia, this isn't the time
to be scaring people.

17:12.075 --> 17:14.241
Do you know what happens
if I get caught with this?

17:16.775 --> 17:18.575
- Is that a cheat sheet?

17:18.675 --> 17:20.241
- It's not for me.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.241
I'm gonna slip it
into Frankie's pocket.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.808
And once I tip off the judges
that there's a cheater,

17:24.907 --> 17:26.275
she's done for.

17:35.772 --> 17:36.672
- Move.

17:36.772 --> 17:37.805
This is Sepulveda's side.

17:37.905 --> 17:39.538
Eldorado's over there.

17:43.572 --> 17:46.205
- The second densest element
in the periodic element is...

17:46.305 --> 17:51.438
of course, um... it's, uh...

17:51.538 --> 17:54.772
um... um...

17:54.805 --> 17:57.672
- Are those X-specs?

17:57.772 --> 18:00.905
This is competition is postponed
until further notice

18:01.005 --> 18:03.805
while we investigate
this attempt at cheating.

18:09.772 --> 18:11.772
- This is very unfortunate.

18:11.838 --> 18:13.605
- I know. I was this close

18:13.772 --> 18:15.772
to getting the cheat sheet
in Frankie's pocket.

18:15.838 --> 18:17.172
- I meant the competition.

18:17.272 --> 18:18.905
We are crushing Eldorado.

18:19.005 --> 18:21.172
If it's canceled,
it won't count.

18:21.272 --> 18:23.338
- Oh yeah, that, too.

18:23.438 --> 18:25.638
- Ron Pomerance
of Eldorado High

18:25.772 --> 18:27.438
has been suspended for cheating.

18:27.538 --> 18:29.972
But the competition
will continue.

18:30.072 --> 18:31.605
- Yes.
- Yes!

18:31.772 --> 18:33.105
This couldn't be better news.

18:33.205 --> 18:35.138
- To deter further cheating,

18:35.238 --> 18:38.038
there will be a full inspection
of all competitors.

18:38.138 --> 18:39.238
Any offenders will be given

18:39.338 --> 18:43.505
an automatic
three-contest suspension.

18:43.605 --> 18:44.638
- Quick, get rid of this.

18:44.772 --> 18:46.238
- No way!
- Wha...

18:46.338 --> 18:49.205
- I am not risking
my future for this.

18:49.305 --> 18:52.405
- Please, stick out your tongue.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.438
It appears we have
another cheater.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.238
- Um, would you believe me
if I said it was a mint?

19:06.372 --> 19:08.472
- I can't believe Tammy
got busted for cheating.

19:08.572 --> 19:11.238
I know she's competitive, but
she wasn't even in the contest.

19:11.338 --> 19:13.772
- It's as baffling
as a missing sock.

19:13.872 --> 19:15.372
But what did the boy
from Eldorado do

19:15.472 --> 19:16.972
that was considered cheating?

19:17.072 --> 19:19.038
- He was using X-specs.

19:19.138 --> 19:20.772
They're glasses
with a hidden computer built-in

19:20.838 --> 19:23.905
so he could look up the answers
to everything on the Internet.

19:24.005 --> 19:25.772
Well, see ya tomorrow.

19:30.072 --> 19:31.405
You okay?

19:31.505 --> 19:34.838
- I look up every answer
to everything on the Internet.

19:34.938 --> 19:36.772
Does that mean I'm a cheater?

19:36.872 --> 19:38.338
- No way. It's different.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.105
He's a human, you're an android,

19:40.205 --> 19:41.538
you don't have a choice.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.972
- But the Brain Squad
is a competition for humans.

19:44.072 --> 19:46.505
I'm obliged to obey human rules.

19:46.605 --> 19:47.605
The solution is clear.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.505
I need to resign
from the Brain Squad team.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.238
- Don't be ridiculous,
they need you.

19:52.338 --> 19:55.172
There has to be something else
you can do.

19:55.272 --> 19:57.838
- Well, there is
one other possibility.

19:57.938 --> 19:59.638
I could disconnect
from the Internet.

19:59.738 --> 20:01.138
- See, there you go.

20:01.238 --> 20:02.672
Problem solved.

20:02.772 --> 20:03.872
Wait.

20:03.972 --> 20:05.972
Wouldn't that just cause
other problems?

20:06.072 --> 20:06.938
- I'm not sure.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.238
I've never tried it.

20:08.338 --> 20:10.372
I will be switching off now,
bye.

20:10.472 --> 20:11.972
- Frankie, wait!

20:12.072 --> 20:14.672
- Don't worry, Dayton Reyes,
I will be okay.

20:18.438 --> 20:21.005
Hopefully.

20:21.105 --> 20:24.105
- This information
is just what I need.

20:24.205 --> 20:25.872
You've done great work.

20:25.972 --> 20:27.338
- I know.

20:27.438 --> 20:30.072
- No one knows better than
Sigourney what a grave threat

20:30.172 --> 20:32.572
a disobedient android is.

20:32.672 --> 20:34.805
She's forbidden Frankie
from talking to a boy.

20:34.905 --> 20:36.605
If Frankie disobeys,

20:36.705 --> 20:40.038
she will have no choice
but to destroy her.

20:46.138 --> 20:47.772
- I got it.
- Oh, nice.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.505
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Sig.

20:51.605 --> 20:53.405
Give me the dets.
How'd it go with Cole?

20:53.505 --> 20:54.138
- It didn't.

20:54.238 --> 20:55.638
He never showed.

20:55.772 --> 20:57.772
- Stood up by a teenager.

20:57.838 --> 20:59.238
Burn.

20:59.338 --> 21:02.572
- Yeah, well, it confirmed
what I thought about Cole Reyes.

21:02.672 --> 21:04.505
He is not
a very impressive young man,

21:04.605 --> 21:07.972
and can't be trusted
around Frankie.

21:08.072 --> 21:09.338
Where is Frankie anyway?

21:09.438 --> 21:11.772
- She had
a Brain Squad competition.

21:11.872 --> 21:12.872
- That ended hours ago.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.638

21:14.772 --> 21:17.772

21:17.838 --> 21:19.105
He's hanging out with Frankie.

21:19.205 --> 21:21.605
- Not funny, Jenny.

21:21.772 --> 21:22.938

21:23.038 --> 21:26.172

21:26.272 --> 21:27.772

21:40.772 --> 21:43.338
