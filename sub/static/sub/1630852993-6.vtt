-Yes, Ellen.

03:29.417 --> 03:33.671
I think that the princess
should have short hair
and wear shorts and sneakers.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.424
But princesses
always have long locks

03:36.507 --> 03:39.177

Why would you want

Well, I could be a princess,
even though I don't have
long hair and a dress, right?
