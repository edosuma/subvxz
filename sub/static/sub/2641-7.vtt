WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:05.285
I cannot believe you made
up your own game.

00:06.144 --> 00:08.799
"Research Lab" is more than a game.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.529
It's like the slogan says:

00:10.654 --> 00:13.627
"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

00:15.629 --> 00:17.642
We must not be playing it right.

00:19.362 --> 00:23.030
All right, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

00:23.868 --> 00:27.068
Look at that. My Department
of Defense research grant is renewed.

00:28.303 --> 00:29.147
Great roll!

00:29.272 --> 00:32.150
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron

00:32.275 --> 00:34.347
and build the large Hadron Collider.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.205
You're a natural at this.

00:39.451 --> 00:42.088
And as the first beta testers,
you two'll have quite the edge

00:42.213 --> 00:44.501
when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.048
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

00:49.336 --> 00:50.363
Why not?

00:50.698 --> 00:53.344
Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you.

00:54.895 --> 00:57.014
I have to pick up
my friend Justin from the airport.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.558
She has to pick up
her friend Justin at the airport.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.894
And I can't play
'cause I'm going with her... right?

01:03.127 --> 01:04.671
If you want.
There may not be room.

01:04.796 --> 01:07.483
He's got a lot of stuff...
like guitars and amplifiers...

01:08.016 --> 01:11.653
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- My friend Justin.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.073
Pay attention.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

01:14.892 --> 01:16.408
- Who is this Justin?
- Your turn.

01:16.578 --> 01:19.078
- I told you about him.
- No, you didn't.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.976
My friend from Omaha, plays the guitar,
he's coming to LA looking for work,

01:23.101 --> 01:25.209
I told him he could crash
on my couch for a few weeks.

01:25.377 --> 01:28.693
Come on... if you roll a six, Penny
dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.

01:30.807 --> 01:33.259
See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.971
Hang on. Some guy is going
to be sleeping on your couch?

01:37.422 --> 01:39.574
He's not "some guy." He's my friend.

01:39.909 --> 01:42.852
So by "friend,"
do you mean "friend friend,"

01:43.021 --> 01:45.879
"gay friend," or "ex-boyfriend
who you're now platonic with

01:46.004 --> 01:48.315
"but still might have a thing
for you friend"?

01:48.986 --> 01:51.110
Well, he's definitely not gay.

01:51.793 --> 01:55.446
A definitely not gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

01:58.382 --> 02:00.453
We went out a little bit,
a long time ago.

02:00.622 --> 02:02.538
But we were never like "going out."

02:02.706 --> 02:04.953
Okay, not to be pedantic,
but last I checked

02:05.078 --> 02:07.460
"went out" was in fact the past
tense of "going out"...

02:07.628 --> 02:09.753
which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism

02:09.878 --> 02:11.556
for "saw each other naked."

02:13.385 --> 02:14.808
I'll just roll for you.

02:16.272 --> 02:18.345
Do you have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

02:18.606 --> 02:19.972
What was your first clue?

02:20.655 --> 02:22.524
Industrial accident.

02:23.986 --> 02:25.978
You know what?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.398
I'm not talking to you like that!
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!

02:29.566 --> 02:31.678
"You accidentally stare
at a helium-argon laser.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.591
"Lose one turn and a retina."

02:34.724 --> 02:36.655
How is that not talking
to me like I'm an idiot?

02:36.823 --> 02:39.492
It's my friend, it's my couch,
and it's my freakin' life!

02:39.661 --> 02:40.971
It's also your roll.

02:41.878 --> 02:43.329
You know what?
It is your life.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.243
If you want to have some stupid
guitarist stay on your couch, then fine!

02:46.368 --> 02:50.127
Why don't you just rent some bunk beds
and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!

02:50.737 --> 02:53.123
If I want to invite
the entire lineup of Lollapalooza

02:53.248 --> 02:55.716
to sleep in my apartment, I will,
and it's none of your business!

02:55.841 --> 02:58.260
Are you listening to yourself?
Do you know how childish you sound?

02:58.478 --> 03:00.930
Now I'm a child?
Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!

03:01.154 --> 03:02.639
The two aren't mutually exclusive!

03:03.044 --> 03:04.307
You are such a...

03:04.816 --> 03:06.351
What the hell is he doing?!

03:06.521 --> 03:09.145
He's drowning us out.
He doesn't like fighting.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.198
Just stop!
Look, the fight is over!

03:11.918 --> 03:12.941
And FYI,

03:13.111 --> 03:15.735
you never even heard
of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!

03:16.023 --> 03:17.209
I heard of 'em!

03:19.007 --> 03:20.738
Didn't know they were a band.

03:22.691 --> 03:24.994
Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

03:31.553 --> 03:34.426
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

03:36.659 --> 03:39.092
No, we just had a little spat.

03:39.433 --> 03:40.737
Look on the bright side.

03:40.862 --> 03:42.739
As the result of Penny's forfeit,

03:42.864 --> 03:46.329
you have become the world's
first winner of "Research Lab."

03:47.293 --> 03:49.103
Would you like
a commemorative snow cone?

03:51.314 --> 03:54.400
Episode 307:
The Guitarist Amplification

03:54.568 --> 03:57.137
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

04:11.293 --> 04:13.755
www.subbercafe.fr

04:19.209 --> 04:20.808
I don't get
how she can just announce

04:20.933 --> 04:23.219
that an old boyfriend is going
to be sleeping on her couch.

04:23.814 --> 04:25.848
I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.349
I don't want to play a game.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.644
It's called "Scientists."
Now, I will name three scientists,

04:30.812 --> 04:32.212
then you will put them in order

04:32.337 --> 04:34.689
of the size of their contribution
to their respective fields.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.827
To make this game
even more compelling,

04:36.952 --> 04:40.111
you must consider only the contribution
of the man to the field,

04:40.406 --> 04:42.479
not the validity
of the field itself.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.981
For example:
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan

04:45.106 --> 04:48.151
made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy

04:48.276 --> 04:50.503
than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

04:50.628 --> 04:52.320
Okay, ready to have some fun?

04:54.003 --> 04:56.209
An old boyfriend
who's definitely not gay.

04:56.334 --> 04:59.089
That's what a guy likes
to hear... "definitely."

04:59.270 --> 05:01.038
All right, I'll start
with an easy one:

05:01.847 --> 05:05.009
Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.306
And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy!

05:08.479 --> 05:11.643
Hint: Madame Curie had
her husband to help her.

05:11.816 --> 05:13.226
What am I supposed to say?

05:13.351 --> 05:15.647
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool
with your old boyfriend

05:15.817 --> 05:17.130
sleeping in your apartment."

05:17.614 --> 05:19.317
"It doesn't
matter if you're cool or not

05:19.487 --> 05:22.569
"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty
and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

05:23.083 --> 05:26.806
"You think you're doing me a favor
by being in a relationship with me!"

05:26.931 --> 05:29.786
"I'm doing you a favor just by
being in the same room as you!"

05:29.968 --> 05:31.301
Leonard! Stop the car!

05:33.102 --> 05:34.026
What?

05:34.151 --> 05:36.459
I can't listen to the
two of you fight anymore.

05:41.822 --> 05:44.457
- Come on, we're late.
- Calm down. We'll make the movie.

05:44.582 --> 05:47.126
I believe my alarm is appropriate,
given the situation.

05:47.251 --> 05:48.654
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

05:48.779 --> 05:51.372
We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard,

05:51.497 --> 05:54.102
plus skip the concession stand,
and preshow urination.

05:55.554 --> 05:59.042
Dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

06:00.261 --> 06:01.965
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!

06:07.377 --> 06:08.825
We're going to the movies.

06:09.081 --> 06:09.993
No, we're not.

06:11.247 --> 06:14.416
We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

06:15.797 --> 06:16.874
Hang on.

06:17.693 --> 06:19.719
They're showing a new digital
print of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

06:19.844 --> 06:22.463
- You wouldn't want to come, would you?
- Not really, no.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.832
Invitation pointlessly offered,
invitation declined as expected,

06:25.957 --> 06:28.646
everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

06:31.027 --> 06:32.627
Just give us a minute.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.551
Take all the time you need.

06:38.748 --> 06:41.108
So, are we going to talk
about last night?

06:41.588 --> 06:42.985
Are you ready to apologize?

06:44.279 --> 06:46.071
Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

06:47.591 --> 06:49.275
Come on.
This is stupid.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.410
There it is again!
You think I'm stupid!

06:51.578 --> 06:54.288
There's a difference between
being stupid and acting stupid!

06:54.456 --> 06:57.416
Well, there's a difference between
being a jerk and being an ass!

06:58.839 --> 07:01.066
No, there isn't!
They're synonyms!

07:04.030 --> 07:06.180
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

07:06.464 --> 07:09.814
Yeah, I don't think I need
my preshow urination anymore.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.886
When that woman moved in 3 years ago,
I told you not to talk to her,

07:15.011 --> 07:16.935
and now, we're going
to be late for the movies.

07:21.526 --> 07:24.464
Hey! Look! <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> 183.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.653
Got it.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.217
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight

07:29.342 --> 07:31.658
and then his girlfriend
breaks up with him.

07:35.025 --> 07:38.665
Want me to get it for you?
It'll help take your mind off things.

07:39.130 --> 07:42.044
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- We need to kill a couple hours

07:42.212 --> 07:43.990
till the next showing
of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.882
No problem, I was thinking
of closing early and going home, but...

07:48.321 --> 07:50.539
let's face it, that's just
a slightly smaller lonely room

07:50.664 --> 07:52.302
filled with comic books.

07:53.842 --> 07:55.092
Thanks, Stuart.

07:56.818 --> 07:59.028
Let me ask you something.
Do you think it's okay for Penny

07:59.153 --> 08:01.021
to have an ex-boyfriend sleep
on her couch?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.496
- She's obviously way out of line.
- Thank you!

08:03.900 --> 08:06.529
But if she dumps you, she'll have
a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning

08:06.654 --> 08:09.863
and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

08:12.218 --> 08:15.035
So the only question is:
how long until you fold?

08:15.530 --> 08:16.905
I am not going to fold.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.482
Well, excuse me, I don't think
Penny's out of line at all.

08:19.607 --> 08:20.932
You don't own her.

08:21.281 --> 08:22.780
It's like my girl Beyoncé says:

08:22.905 --> 08:25.401
"If you like it,
you shoulda put a ring on it."

08:27.924 --> 08:30.581
At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it,

08:30.706 --> 08:32.094
she should've backed off.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.178
Like when a guy's upset cause his friend
agreed to take a cooking class with him

08:35.303 --> 08:38.892
and then doesn't show up because
he's doing a juice fast with his mother?

08:39.595 --> 08:41.446
I didn't know
you were upset about that.

08:41.571 --> 08:43.476
Really! Did you miss all
the subtle indicators,

08:43.601 --> 08:45.566
like me saying,
"Howard, I am upset."

08:45.923 --> 08:48.277
- Okay, sorry.
- Maybe it means something different.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.321
Back in India, it means
you're upset with a guy named Howard!

08:51.489 --> 08:54.219
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make up for the fact

08:54.344 --> 08:56.783
that I had to make chicken
and rice with this vegan guy.

08:56.908 --> 08:59.095
Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is?

08:59.220 --> 09:00.220
Rice!

09:01.159 --> 09:02.785
Well, you think I was having fun,

09:02.910 --> 09:04.945
sitting around all night
listening to my mother say,

09:05.070 --> 09:07.622
"Have you ever peed so much
in your life?"

09:08.381 --> 09:11.033
My God, you are such a mama's boy.

09:11.158 --> 09:14.761
- Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
- You brought your mother into this!

09:15.083 --> 09:16.305
Stop it, both of you!

09:16.974 --> 09:19.471
All this fighting, I might as well
be back with my parents!

09:19.596 --> 09:22.285
"Damn it, George, I told you if you
didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"

09:22.410 --> 09:24.067
"I guess that makes you a liar.

09:24.192 --> 09:26.106
"Cause I'm drunk as hell
and you're still here!"

09:26.596 --> 09:28.858
"Stop yelling!
You're making Sheldon cry!"

09:28.983 --> 09:30.722
"I'll tell you
what's making Sheldon cry!

09:30.847 --> 09:32.571
"That I let you name him Sheldon!"

09:39.909 --> 09:41.759
Boy, what got him so upset?

09:42.850 --> 09:45.600
Oh, sure, you can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

09:53.536 --> 09:55.552
Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

09:56.647 --> 09:58.661
With the other half of my tip.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.769
Hey, Sheldon.
What are you doing here?

10:03.978 --> 10:05.980
This is a restaurant.
It's lunchtime.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.940
I would think, as a waitress,
you'd be familiar with the paradigm.

10:09.543 --> 10:10.790
Is Leonard coming?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.821
I believe he is waiting for you to come
crawling back to him and apologize.

10:15.206 --> 10:17.720
- That's not gonna happen.
- I assumed that would be your attitude.

10:17.845 --> 10:19.910
- Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
- Which is?

10:20.078 --> 10:22.621
I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

10:23.003 --> 10:24.174
I'm busy.

10:24.299 --> 10:25.656
Excuse me, miss.

10:25.781 --> 10:27.496
I'd like to order lunch.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.383
- Fine. What do you want?
- I have a few questions.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.427
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half-sandwich?

10:38.253 --> 10:41.109
Where exactly does
the half-sandwich come from?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.642
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich,

10:44.358 --> 10:47.493
or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.981
No, Sheldon,
they just make a half-sandwich.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.858
You can't make a half-sandwich.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.529
If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

10:56.045 --> 10:59.116
Fine, it's soup and a small sandwich.
Is that what you want?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.383
Of course not. I'll have my usual.

11:02.393 --> 11:03.116
Great.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.205
Aren't you going to ask me
if I want a beverage?

11:05.543 --> 11:06.980
Don't you usually get lemonade?

11:07.105 --> 11:08.292
Do you want lemonade?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.919
- Anything else?
- I want you to apologize to Leonard.

11:12.377 --> 11:14.709
I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing wrong.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.734
- He is completely overreacting.
- Irrelevant.

11:16.859 --> 11:20.045
The disruption in your relationship
is making my life intolerable.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.140
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.360
I don't follow.

11:26.928 --> 11:29.438
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

11:29.606 --> 11:33.275
All right, let's assume, <i>ad argumentum</i>,
that in this case, Leonard is wrong.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.818
Leonard is wrong.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.110
Considering the number of transgressions
you've committed that he's overlooked,

11:38.235 --> 11:40.699
don't you think that, just this once,
you could return the favor?

11:41.397 --> 11:42.909
I'm coming. Good-bye, Sheldon.

11:47.923 --> 11:50.322
What do you mean,
transgressions I've committed?

11:51.047 --> 11:53.962
Were you under the impression
Leonard has no complaints about you?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.262
Like what?!

11:55.387 --> 11:57.620
I see you, you're making
a little check sign in the air.

11:57.745 --> 11:59.079
Just hold your horses.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.888
- What does Leonard complain about?
- Your driving.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.870
The plethora
of stuffed animals on your bed

12:04.995 --> 12:07.350
that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

12:09.236 --> 12:11.229
Your constant tardiness,
your singing.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.274
- My singing?
- That's actually from my list.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.567
But Leonard would be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

12:16.262 --> 12:19.035
If Leonard has so many problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

12:19.160 --> 12:21.656
Because, according to him,
you're oversensitive and have a temper.

12:22.388 --> 12:24.242
Oh, really?
Well, then, do me a favor

12:24.410 --> 12:26.660
and tell Leonard
that he can drop dead!

12:30.918 --> 12:33.459
And she wonders
why she's constantly undertipped.

12:39.113 --> 12:40.297
Good, you're home.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.191
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Sure.

12:42.316 --> 12:43.916
Go apologize to Penny.

12:44.925 --> 12:46.892
- What?!
- Right now would be good.

12:48.422 --> 12:50.602
Although, a few minutes ago
would have been better.

12:51.442 --> 12:55.399
Seems you don't like my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.734
What? Who would tell you
something like that?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.070
Why would you tell her
something like that?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.739
It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?

13:03.218 --> 13:05.695
Yeah, it's true,
but I can live with that stuff.

13:05.820 --> 13:08.005
What I can't live with is
you casually informing me

13:08.130 --> 13:11.081
that a guy's staying in your apartment
without even asking me first!

13:11.465 --> 13:14.511
That isn't your problem!
Your problem is you don't trust me!

13:15.545 --> 13:18.755
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

13:19.003 --> 13:20.882
Sheldon?
Where did he go?

13:21.686 --> 13:24.085
Your yelling must have
freaked him out again.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.097
Where are you going?! You walk away
in the middle of an argument?!

13:27.265 --> 13:29.284
I'm gonna find your roommate
before he hurts himself

13:29.409 --> 13:30.934
trying to cross the street!

13:31.803 --> 13:33.106
Why didn't you say so?

13:33.231 --> 13:35.217
Now I need your permission
for that, too?!

13:35.342 --> 13:37.068
I can't read your mind, Penny!

13:37.193 --> 13:39.714
Really? Why not?
You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!

13:47.105 --> 13:48.883
Stop knocking!
It's open!

13:49.816 --> 13:51.997
Tell my parents that
our dark matter research

13:52.165 --> 13:53.410
is at a critical juncture,

13:53.535 --> 13:55.458
and I can't come home
for my cousin wedding.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.189
<i>Ask our son what we're supposed to say
to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry,</i>

13:59.314 --> 14:01.265
<i>whose daughter, Lakshmi
is flying in from London,</i>

14:01.390 --> 14:03.066
<i>for the sole purpose of meeting him.</i>

14:03.302 --> 14:05.010
I didn't ask you
to set me up with her.

14:05.179 --> 14:06.933
<i>- You should be thanking us!
- Yes.</i>

14:07.058 --> 14:09.139
<i>Lakshmi just got
her stomach stapled.</i>

14:10.725 --> 14:12.608
<i>You have an opportunity
to get in good with her</i>

14:12.733 --> 14:15.103
<i>before she loses weight,
and her self-esteem goes up.</i>

14:15.376 --> 14:16.563
I don't care!

14:16.893 --> 14:19.191
And why don't you think I can find
a woman for myself?

14:19.376 --> 14:22.131
<i>Because you're 27, and the closest thing
we have to a daughter-in-law</i>

14:22.256 --> 14:24.056
<i>is that Jewish boy Howard.</i>

14:25.009 --> 14:27.375
That is completely below the belt.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.500
Sheldon, tell my parents
that Howard and I are just friends.

14:32.877 --> 14:34.877
Howard and I are just friends!

14:38.691 --> 14:40.791
Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.182
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

14:52.878 --> 14:54.572
Why don't you just let me find him

14:54.697 --> 14:56.684
while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

14:57.625 --> 15:01.144
The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

15:01.269 --> 15:02.316
What stop sign?

15:02.441 --> 15:04.191
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!

15:14.277 --> 15:17.798
<i>Howard, answer the door!
I'm busy!</i>

15:18.366 --> 15:20.805
<i>I'm busy, too!
You answer it.</i>

15:20.930 --> 15:23.338
<i>I can't! I'm on the toilet!</i>

15:24.382 --> 15:26.273
<i>For God's sake,
I don't need to hear that!</i>

15:26.398 --> 15:28.448
<i>Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?</i>

15:28.748 --> 15:32.264
<i>I said I'm busy,
but that wasn't good enough for you!</i>

15:32.653 --> 15:34.936
<i>I hope it's one of those
home invasion deals,</i>

15:35.061 --> 15:36.658
<i>and they shoot me in the head!</i>

15:37.248 --> 15:41.156
<i>Well, if it's a home invader,
don't tell them I'm on the toilet!</i>

15:45.749 --> 15:47.299
There's no one there.

15:47.764 --> 15:49.910
<i>You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady!</i>

15:54.124 --> 15:55.874
Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.707
Yeah, he's over in
the graphic novel section.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.502
Built himself a little nest.

16:03.285 --> 16:04.285
Thank you.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.883
- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

16:09.438 --> 16:11.511
Sheldon told me
you and Leonard were having a fight?

16:12.316 --> 16:14.873
Yeah, kind of.
It's no big thing.

16:14.998 --> 16:15.998
Good, good.

16:17.088 --> 16:18.138
I love you.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.355
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.046
- What's going on?
- It's a little hard to explain.

16:25.171 --> 16:28.008
He does this thing where he pretends
he's in an alternate dimension

16:28.133 --> 16:30.261
that occupies the
same physical space we're in,

16:30.386 --> 16:32.136
but he can't perceive us.

16:33.873 --> 16:36.723
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.

16:38.744 --> 16:41.496
Come on, Sheldon, let's go home.
Look, we're done fighting.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.075
I've heard that before.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.559
But then, the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom,

16:45.684 --> 16:47.563
blaring a Richard Feynman lecture

16:47.688 --> 16:49.761
while my mom is shouting
that Jesus would forgive her

16:49.886 --> 16:52.081
if she put ground glass
in my dad's meatloaf.

16:53.544 --> 16:57.346
And my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

16:59.201 --> 17:02.270
There's going to be no more shouting
and no skeet-shooting.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.315
Really?
Where's your friend Justin gonna sleep?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.915
Yeah... where's he gonna sleep?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.944
Oh, my God, would you let this go?!

17:10.112 --> 17:11.311
I'd let it go.

17:13.513 --> 17:14.682
Why should I let it go?

17:14.807 --> 17:16.992
Why don't you just tell the guy
to find another place?!

17:18.913 --> 17:20.413
Oh, for God's sakes.

17:22.747 --> 17:24.621
So, you have childhood issues.

17:24.746 --> 17:26.589
We all have childhood issues.

17:26.714 --> 17:29.297
At some point, you just need
to grow up and get past them.

17:29.577 --> 17:30.590
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

17:31.922 --> 17:33.635
Will you just let me
handle this, please?

17:43.790 --> 17:45.569
Please, try and understand.

17:45.694 --> 17:49.150
Leonard and I are in a relationship,
and occasionally, we're going to fight.

17:49.759 --> 17:53.051
But no matter what happens between us,
we will always love you.

17:55.622 --> 17:56.825
Right, Leonard?

17:57.565 --> 17:59.165
Always is a long time.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.770
Sure. Always.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.696
How about we buy you this robot,
and then we all go home?

18:08.684 --> 18:09.984
I want that one.

18:11.227 --> 18:12.590
Okay, you can have that one.

18:13.013 --> 18:15.483
Come on, he's just going
to play with it twice,

18:15.608 --> 18:18.530
and then it'll end up in his closet
with all the other junk.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.015
Buy him the robot.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.937
Can I get this comic book, too?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.271
Yes, you can.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.611
We meet again.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.030
What did Justin say
when you told him

18:44.155 --> 18:45.801
he couldn't sleep on your couch?

18:45.926 --> 18:46.980
He's a musician.

18:47.105 --> 18:49.516
He'll sleep in his own vomit,
if he has to.

18:58.827 --> 19:02.416
I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot.
