(* "Gotta Get Out Of Kansas")

00:16.650 --> 00:18.819
* Wind blowing through my hair

00:18.852 --> 00:23.091
* Everybody telling me
there's nowhere like home

00:23.124 --> 00:24.392
* No, no

00:26.660 --> 00:28.796
* There's somewhere else for me

00:28.829 --> 00:33.201
* I need to take
the opportunity and go

00:33.234 --> 00:36.270
* And go, yeah

00:36.304 --> 00:38.206
* 'Cause 'round here
it's all too far

00:38.239 --> 00:40.508
* And when I look up
to the stars

00:40.541 --> 00:43.811
* I wanna be,
I wanna be like they are

00:43.844 --> 00:46.114
* Oh, oh, oh

00:46.147 --> 00:50.318
* Sometimes you gotta get
out of Kansas

00:50.351 --> 00:54.288
* And sometimes you gotta
take your chances

00:54.322 --> 00:55.856
* Find the answer

00:55.889 --> 00:57.858
* 'Cause no one ever made it
just waiting around

00:57.891 --> 01:01.295
* For their big 15 minutes
in a two-bit town

01:01.329 --> 01:04.397
* And one thing I know
is crystal-clear

01:04.432 --> 01:06.700
* I gotta get out of here

01:10.904 --> 01:13.641
* A new sound,
a whole new crowd

01:13.674 --> 01:17.278
* Why whisper,
when I want to sing out loud?

01:17.311 --> 01:20.814
* And let me hear you say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

01:20.848 --> 01:23.184
* I'm on land but I can fly

01:23.217 --> 01:27.388
* Something in my heart
saying I was meant to shine

01:27.421 --> 01:30.624
* Like a diamond in the sky

01:30.658 --> 01:33.194
* I wanna see my name in lights

01:33.227 --> 01:35.163
* And someone
to buy the movie rights

01:35.196 --> 01:38.499
* I wanna hear my music
come to life

01:38.532 --> 01:40.501
* Oh

01:40.534 --> 01:44.672
* Sometimes you gotta get
out of Kansas

01:44.705 --> 01:48.442
* And sometimes
you gotta take your chances

01:48.476 --> 01:50.711
* Find the answer

01:50.744 --> 01:52.646
* 'Cause no one ever made it
just waiting around

01:52.680 --> 01:55.383
* For their big 15 minutes
in a two-bit town

01:55.416 --> 01:58.452
* And one thing I know
is crystal-clear

01:58.486 --> 02:01.121
* I gotta get outta here

02:03.224 --> 02:06.560
* I gotta get outta here

02:06.594 --> 02:08.729
* Mm-mm

02:08.762 --> 02:11.399
* I gotta get out of here

02:13.601 --> 02:16.370
(woman) Dorothy.
I gotta get out of here.

02:16.404 --> 02:20.241
Dorothy!
Enough daydreaming,
Dorothy.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.610
You know, these ketchup bottles
ain't gonna refill themselves.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.414
Sorry, Aunt Em.
I just can't stop thinking
about my audition today.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.782
So, how do I look?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.584
You look like one of them girls
in one of them rap videos.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.254
Order's up!

02:33.287 --> 02:36.424
Uncle Henry, what do you
think of my outfit?

02:36.457 --> 02:40.294
You look like
one of them girls
in a rap video.

02:40.328 --> 02:43.831
But we cannot allow you
to walk around the street
dressed like that.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.400
Dorothy's old enough
to dress the way she wants,
don't you think?

02:46.434 --> 02:49.403
Now, Em, don't get mad.
Baby? Uh-oh.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.242
There you go.
It's three o'clock.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.378
I've gotta go to my audition.
And this is what I'm wearing.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.313
What? You can't leave.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.483
Hey, Early. Hey!
Hey, Em.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.485
I need you
for the early-bird rush.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.923
I know I'm leaving you
short-handed, Aunt Em,
but this is big.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.527
I mean, if they like me,
I could get out of Kansas
and become somebody.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.497
If they like you?
See, that's your problem.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.967
Look, now, you can roll
out of here in one of
those stretch Hummers

03:20.000 --> 03:21.902
and sing all around the world,

03:21.935 --> 03:23.971
but you never gonna get
to where you wanna be

03:24.004 --> 03:26.006
until you're happy
with who you are.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.942
What?
You can go to your audition
after your shift is over.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.645
But I'm already gonna be late!
(Uncle Henry whispers)
Psst, Dorothy.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.382
Over here. Come, come, come,
come, come, come, come.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.285
Nice to see you, Glen.
(Uncle Henry) So that's it?

03:37.318 --> 03:40.020
You're just gonna pass up
an opportunity to audition
for the Muppets,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.690
the most powerful puppets
in Hollywood?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.393
(Dorothy) You heard
the wise one:

03:45.426 --> 03:47.628
"You're not gonna
where you're going
till you're where you're at."

03:47.661 --> 03:50.564
Well, you've been a great
employee at my diner
for years now,

03:50.598 --> 03:53.567
and it's time I repaid
the favor. So, go on
to your audition.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.269
Thanks!
Go on.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.039
Excuse me. Henry!
Hey, baby.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.975
Henry!
Remember what I said.
Ten percent.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.412
I'm kidding.
Henry! Where's she off to?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.380
Who?
Who?

04:06.414 --> 04:07.915
I don't see anybody,
I don't know who you're
talking to.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.584
Hey, have you ever seen
an African avocado?

04:10.618 --> 04:14.488
They're orange,
but they taste just
like peanut butter.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.425
What? Guess what we're
having for dinner.
A basketful of kisses, honey.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.562
Oh, man! Who put a gym shoe
in the deep fryer?

04:29.937 --> 04:33.707
Sir? Sir, hi.
I'm here for the audition.

04:33.741 --> 04:37.711
I'm afraid auditions ended
at four, due to slim pickin's.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.348
Please, I'm only
five minutes late.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.451
Oh, alas, I feel your pain.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.320
But the Muppets have gone
and where they are now,

04:46.354 --> 04:49.957
heaven only knows.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.462
(Kermit) OK, guys,
if you gotta go, go.
Next stop, Nebraska.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.897
Who'd have thought it would be
so hard to find an all-American
girl with talent?

04:56.930 --> 05:00.634
Yeah, how do the producers
of Girls Gone Wild do it?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.471
Mr. Kermit! Miss Piggy!

05:03.504 --> 05:06.073
Oh, great, a groupie.
Sorry, dear, no autographs.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.542
Actually, I wanted
to sing for you,

05:08.576 --> 05:10.978
but if it's too late,
do you think maybe you can
listen to my demo?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.746
Oh, I...
No time.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.383
We'll have to get your song
off Napster.
No, no, Piggy.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.519
Sure, uh, gee...
And you're a singer?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.554
Yeah.
And you did this demo
yourself?

05:20.588 --> 05:23.791
All by myself.
Time to go!

05:23.824 --> 05:26.126
Well, listen, I will try
to listen to your CD!

05:26.159 --> 05:29.029
OK, thanks for your time.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.422
Why are you doing that?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.690
I thought it would make
the moment more dramatic.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.426
(tuts)

06:16.977 --> 06:18.479
(man over radio) It's not
looking pretty out there
tonight

06:18.512 --> 06:21.482
with strong gusts of wind
up to 90 miles an hour

06:21.515 --> 06:23.016
through the Central Plain area.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.453
Don't forget
the toilet paper.
This just in.

06:25.486 --> 06:30.424
The National Weather Bureau
has raised the twister alert
from right-foot green,

06:30.458 --> 06:32.893
to right-foot yellow.
Do you know what that means,
folks?

06:32.926 --> 06:37.698
All you people in Boomville
and Washedup should take
extra precautions tonight...

06:37.731 --> 06:41.068
Baby, what took you so long?
Did you miss your bus?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.737
You got what you wanted,
I'm still stuck here.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.009
You need to talk
to your niece.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.813
You need to talk
to your niece.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.716
OK, I'll talk to her.
I'm just packing the box.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.894
Toto, is this it for me?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.596
Serving meatloaf to truckers

07:08.629 --> 07:11.131
and living
in a Kansas trailer park?

07:21.842 --> 07:24.044
Now, I know you think
show business

07:24.077 --> 07:26.614
is all glitz and glamour,
but it's not.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.082
Well, that is true.
That is very, very true.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.085
Hollywood is full of crime
and flash fires,

07:32.119 --> 07:34.087
earthquakes, paparazzi...

07:34.121 --> 07:35.889
(imitates camera shutter)

07:35.923 --> 07:38.592
You know, it's not safe.
Not like here.
(thunder)

07:42.195 --> 07:44.632
Look, I know you wanna leave,
but you still belong here

07:44.665 --> 07:46.266
with your family
and your friends.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.537
What friends?
What friends? Come on.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.772
Toto's your friend,
and um...

07:51.805 --> 07:54.842
uh, you got, uh...

07:54.875 --> 07:57.678
Toto's your friend.
Toto's a prawn
I rescued from the diner

07:57.711 --> 08:00.113
because you won't let me
have a dog.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.115
Well, dogs are funky.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.252
And they got fleas, OK?

08:05.285 --> 08:08.956
Look, how about this?
When this blows over,

08:08.989 --> 08:11.759
we will go to the Karaoke Bar
and Buffet.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.562
Sing, girl!
Don't you guys get it?

08:14.595 --> 08:17.698
I don't want to sing karaoke
in some little Kansas
restaurant.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.167
I want an exciting life.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.870
I want to go somewhere
where I can see a concert,

08:22.903 --> 08:25.973
or take dance lessons,
or maybe even learn kabbalah.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.809
Kabbalah?
Did she blaspheme?
I don't think so, baby.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.645
I wanna go somewhere
where I can be someone.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.982
Maybe even a star.
OK, now,

08:36.015 --> 08:38.686
do you wanna be a star
or a singer?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.688
Because they're not
the same thing.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.256
Well, all I know is that
I hate living here and I don't
want to end up like you.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.894
(warning siren)
Uh-oh.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.896
Uh-oh. Well...

08:48.929 --> 08:52.132
Hey, did you know that
in the Northern Hemisphere,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.167
hurricanes, they twist
counterclockwise,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.870
but in the Southern Hemisphere
they twist clockwise?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.172
I'd hate to be the guy
that figured that out.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.808
With the wind
just blowing everything...

09:03.276 --> 09:07.280
Well, that's the round.
Back to your corners.

09:07.314 --> 09:13.186
I'm heading to the storm shelter
before this tornado hits
and we all die.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.323
Anybody care to join me?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.992
Great. Now I'm stuck
with these two knuckleheads
in the storm shelter.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.334
Dorothy, come on!

09:35.843 --> 09:39.079
Henry, come on!
Come on, I'll help you.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.248
Come on, babe.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.257
Wait! I forgot Toto!
No, it's just a shrimp!

09:50.290 --> 09:52.926
He's not a shrimp,
he's a king prawn!

09:52.960 --> 09:54.728
Dorothy!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.299
Dorothy!

10:02.069 --> 10:03.771
(screams)

10:06.807 --> 10:09.176
Toto! Toto!

10:16.249 --> 10:18.952
(screams) Sorry, Toto!

10:20.888 --> 10:24.257
When I make it big, I'm gonna
buy a nice brick house

10:24.291 --> 10:25.993
that's anchored to the ground.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.122
Ouch!

10:58.892 --> 11:01.294
Toto!

11:01.328 --> 11:04.932
Toto! Come on, Toto!
Where are you?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.469
Toto!

11:09.502 --> 11:13.140
(Spanish accent) Hola!
(both scream)

11:13.173 --> 11:15.375
¿Por qué? What is it?
Why do we scream, OK?

11:15.408 --> 11:18.378
You're all big.
And you're talking.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.482
Sí. But more importantly,
I am naked, OK.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.483
(laughs)

11:23.516 --> 11:25.919
Wait! No!
Huh? What?

11:25.953 --> 11:29.189
Here.
Oh, no, no, no.
He's not my type, OK.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.358
The clothes.
OK. Oh, the clothes.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.126
You want me to put
on the clothes,

11:33.160 --> 11:34.494
you just have to say,
"Put on the clothes."

11:34.527 --> 11:35.729
(thud)

11:35.763 --> 11:37.430
OK.
(fabric ripping)

11:41.001 --> 11:43.470
Hmm. Oh, it's a nice fit, OK?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.372
Yeah, it's kind of cute.
I like how...

11:45.405 --> 11:47.307
Sí, sí.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.509
What am I doing?
Hmm?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.445
You can't be
talking to me.
Oh. Oh, but I am.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.115
I need some air.
Sí, sí.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.185
I have this effect
on all the womens, OK.
I'll come with you.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.190
Little help, please.
Come on, Toto.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.894
Gracias.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.396
There.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.431
(both gasp)

12:13.500 --> 12:16.536
(Toto) Dios mío!
It's incredible.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.439
They get satellite here.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.375
(gasps) Can't believe...

12:23.877 --> 12:26.279
Do you see what I see?
Yeah.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.783
All the houses are so tiny.
It's a small world,
after all.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.820
Oh, my gosh. What...?
I can't believe it.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.989
I can't believe it.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.791
(Dorothy) Oh, man!

12:39.292 --> 12:41.361
Toto...

12:41.394 --> 12:43.931
Where the...?
Wait!

12:43.964 --> 12:46.934
For those of you who have
Dark Side of the Moon,
press play...

12:46.967 --> 12:49.169
(chattering)
...now.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.539
Ay, Chihuahua!
No, wait.
They're not Chihuahuas.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.541
Ay, rats! Rats in hats!

12:54.574 --> 12:57.444
(chuckles)
Rats in hats, get it?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.913
I am a poet
and I didn't even realize
I had such capabilities.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.216
OK. I work in a diner,
I know how to handle rats.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.551
Rats? We ain't rats.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.554
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.556
We're the Munchkins
of Munchkinland.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.425
The book, the book, the book!
Come on, come on, come on.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.563
OK. And I quote:

13:16.596 --> 13:19.833
Ahem.
"Rat: a long-tailed rodent,

13:19.867 --> 13:23.603
especially one of
the genus Rattus.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.175
"Munchkin: a cuddly,
cute and clean creature

13:28.208 --> 13:31.411
who resides
in the land of Oz."

13:31.444 --> 13:32.846
Munchkins?
Yeah.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.982
Sorry, but I know a rat
when I see one.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.117
Hey. Whatever you say
there, short stacks.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.219
All I know is, thanks to you,
the Wicked Witch of the East

13:39.252 --> 13:41.221
is dead and we are free!

13:41.254 --> 13:43.456
(cheering)
(woman) Free?

13:43.490 --> 13:47.627
You're not free!
Get over here and get
this tin can off me! Now!

13:47.660 --> 13:50.630
Oh, my gosh, she's alive!
Quick, we gotta help her!

13:50.663 --> 13:52.832
(muttering)
(woman) Please, help me up!

13:56.036 --> 13:58.171
Well, Munchkins,
we're too late.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.572
Guys!
But no tears -

13:59.606 --> 14:01.408
she's in a better place.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
(all) Yeah!

14:03.410 --> 14:05.578
(grunting)

14:09.516 --> 14:11.218
I'm gonna put you
in a better place -

14:11.251 --> 14:13.887
in my oven! You hear me?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.124
Um... (giggles)

14:17.157 --> 14:19.426
Could someone spot me?

14:19.459 --> 14:22.329
Wow! This is a lot heavier
than I...

14:26.099 --> 14:27.901
Ew!

14:30.570 --> 14:33.073
OK. Now she's dead!

14:35.242 --> 14:37.144
(Toto) What is that?

14:39.146 --> 14:43.016
Hey, look! Even the twisters
are Munchkin-sized.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.018
Oh, that's no twister -
that's her sister.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.686
She's the sister of the witch

14:46.719 --> 14:48.989
that you just crushed
with a house.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.391
Sister?

14:54.427 --> 14:57.330
Bonjour, Munchie-kins!
(giggles)

14:57.364 --> 14:59.933
Cuddles! Cuddles!

14:59.967 --> 15:02.035
(kissing noises)

15:02.069 --> 15:04.304
Each and every one of you!

15:04.337 --> 15:06.406
My speed dating ended early,

15:06.439 --> 15:08.708
so I thought
I'd drop in for a cuddle

15:08.741 --> 15:10.443
and a visit with
my wicked East-Coast sister.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.512
Uh... Yeah, well,

15:12.545 --> 15:15.715
a funny thing about
the East-Coast sister.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.318
Not so much funny as...
uh... uh...

15:18.351 --> 15:21.554
disturbing.
Disturbing. Yes.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.024
You see, this giant girl
right over here

15:24.057 --> 15:26.626
kinda squashed her to death
with a double-wide.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.528
What?
Yeah.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.498
Uh... Right here.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.334
(gasps)

15:34.367 --> 15:37.370
Excuse me,
I just want you to know

15:37.404 --> 15:40.473
that I've never met
this giant girl before
in my entire life.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.243
Sorry, Dorothy...
um... Giant Girl.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.445
It was an accident.
I swear.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.182
Well, in that case,
c'est la vie!
La vie! La vie!

15:49.216 --> 15:52.519
I drop things
all the time myself.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.354
Charmed to make
your acquaintance.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.491
I am Tattypoo,
the old and Good Witch
of the North.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.193
But you're so young
and beautiful.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.029
(giggles)
Aren't you a cutie!

16:02.062 --> 16:03.696
(Munchkin) No, you are!
You are!

16:03.730 --> 16:07.400
So tell me, what kind of
magical abilities do you have?

16:07.434 --> 16:10.070
Well, I don't have
any magical abilities,

16:10.103 --> 16:13.140
but I am a singer.
I mean, I want to be a singer.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.109
(Toto) Mm, and she's
very good, OK.
A singer?

16:16.143 --> 16:18.345
Really?
Oh, that's so funny!
I'm a singer too.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.081
Yes, my sisters and I

16:21.114 --> 16:22.415
were once the hottest
girl band in Oz.
Yeah!

16:25.785 --> 16:29.589
But all that fame and fortune
left me feeling empty inside.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.192
So I quit show biz
and committed my life

16:32.225 --> 16:35.195
to advancing rights
for the vertically challenged
of Oz,

16:35.228 --> 16:37.230
my little Munchie-wunchies.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
Aw!
Cuddles!

16:40.733 --> 16:42.202
(giggling)

16:42.235 --> 16:45.072
Oh, yes!

16:45.105 --> 16:47.040
(kissing noises)

16:48.741 --> 16:51.744
Well, it's been nice
meeting you and all,

16:51.778 --> 16:54.447
but I should probably
be on my way.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.449
Anyone know how to get
to Kansas from here?

16:56.483 --> 16:59.686
Never heard of it.
Is this Kansas
a civilized country?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.589
Well, if by civilized
you mean flat,
boring and gray,

17:02.622 --> 17:04.491
yeah, it's civilized.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.825
Well, then, why do you
want to go back?

17:05.858 --> 17:09.162
Yeah, why do we want
to go back?
Well, because...

17:09.195 --> 17:12.398
Aunt Em and... Well...

17:12.432 --> 17:15.468
I don't know what Kansas is,
but if you want to be
a famous singer,

17:15.502 --> 17:18.637
you must see the wonderful
Wizard of Oz.
Yeah!

17:18.671 --> 17:21.308
First...

17:21.340 --> 17:23.410
(grunts)
(pop)

17:23.443 --> 17:25.512
...you have to wear
my sister's shoes. Here.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.849
You want me to wear shoes
off a nasty old witch?
I don't think so.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.752
Oh, but there's
a powerful magic
connected to them.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.155
And look how sparkly they are.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.756
Mm-mm.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
(laughs)

17:42.395 --> 17:45.198
(continues laughing)

17:45.232 --> 17:48.635
Listen, high pockets,
here's how things work
in enchanted lands.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.637
Shoes have magical powers.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.805
If you have the shoes,
you get the powers.

17:52.839 --> 17:56.243
But if you're going to question
every little detail,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.845
the whole thing's gonna fall
apart and we might as well
call it a day, OK?

17:58.878 --> 18:01.314
(Munchkins) OK?

18:01.348 --> 18:04.384
(singsong) They're Manolos.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.154
Manolos?
Why didn't you say that?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.491
Check the label.
Yeah, they're good.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.327
I'll help you, OK.
(all) Ooh!

18:16.863 --> 18:19.366
Those are unbelievable, OK?

18:22.835 --> 18:26.206
Wow! They fit perfectly!

18:26.239 --> 18:28.808
If the power of these
magic shoes is supposed
to make you feel

18:28.841 --> 18:32.912
confident and sexy,
then mission accomplished.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.681
So, take me
to meet your wizard.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.916
To get to the wizard,

18:36.949 --> 18:41.488
just follow this road
of yellow brick
to Emerald City.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.756
It's in the exact center
of our country.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.792
Wait, I gotta walk
to the center of your country?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.427
There's not, like, a bus
or something I can take?

18:47.460 --> 18:51.264
You wanna be a star or not?
OK, OK, sorry.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.932
Well, let's go.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.336
Oh, hold up there,
Giant Girl.
The name's Dorothy.

18:56.369 --> 19:00.240
Well, Dorothy, we Munchkins
kinda owe ya for saving us
and all.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.543
You ever need a favor,
you just give us a holler,
like so...

19:04.877 --> 19:06.846
(blows pitch pipe)

19:06.879 --> 19:08.481
* Calling all Munchkins

19:08.515 --> 19:10.483
* Let's do lunchkins

19:10.517 --> 19:12.352
* One for all
* And all for one

19:12.385 --> 19:16.256
* Calling all Munchkins
Munchkins, Munchkins, Munchkins

19:16.289 --> 19:18.391
* Take our call

19:18.425 --> 19:21.361
You sing that
and we'll come a-scampering.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.331
Uh, yeah, we'll be sure
to do this, OK.
Let's go, Dorothy.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.666
One more thing. (giggles)

19:26.699 --> 19:28.435
I don't know why I didn't
mention this before.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.204
Whatever you do,
avoid the west.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.206
My other evil sister
rules there,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.942
and if she finds out
you have the silver shoes,

19:35.975 --> 19:37.844
she'll hunt you down
and pry them off your cold,
dead carcass.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.447
What?
(giggles) Bye.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.582
Why are you just now
telling me this?

19:45.252 --> 19:47.654
Come on, Dorothy. You're not
getting any younger, OK.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.856
Let's go get famous.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.925
I don't know.
That Witch of the West thing
sounds kind of dangerous.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.363
Don't worry about it.
You're going to have
to trust me, you know?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.964
I'm your agent, OK.
I'm your agent.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.568
When did I make you
my agent?
Well, since you're asking,

20:01.601 --> 20:03.470
I thought possibly
what we could do is...

20:03.503 --> 20:05.438
Come on, short stuff.
(muffled talking)

20:12.345 --> 20:14.447
(Dorothy) I wish you'd stop
with this whole agent thing.

20:14.481 --> 20:18.285
Yes, yes, I know.
It's very awkward
for you, OK.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.820
But I think it's very important
that we discuss my commission.

20:20.853 --> 20:25.625
So, it seems that
50 percent is easiest.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.560
I think I liked it better
when you couldn't talk.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.595
(laughs)

20:28.628 --> 20:30.997
Well, you think about it, OK.
Take your time.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.766
I'm gonna get some corn.
It's fresh on the cobs, OK.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.604
(laughs)

20:44.411 --> 20:47.447
What are you doing?
What?

20:47.480 --> 20:51.318
You didn't by chance see
that movie The Passion, huh?

20:51.351 --> 20:53.320
No, so don't ruin
the ending.
No, that's not what--

20:53.353 --> 20:55.888
Personally,
I liked The Birds.
Figures.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.957
Hey, you got something
in your eye.
What?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.460
This! Yah! Yah! Yah!
Hey, stop that!

21:00.493 --> 21:02.695
You...!

21:02.729 --> 21:04.030
Hey, stop that!
(laughs)

21:04.063 --> 21:06.733
Hey!
Oh, this is the last straw!

21:06.766 --> 21:08.835
No, I see one right here.
Stop that!

21:08.868 --> 21:11.538
Get our grubby beak
off him!
Huh?

21:13.005 --> 21:14.874
(cuckoo clock chirping)

21:14.907 --> 21:17.377
Cuckoo!

21:17.410 --> 21:20.413
You OK?
Huh? What?

21:20.447 --> 21:23.516
Oh, I'm fine.
But lucky for that crow
you showed up when you did

21:23.550 --> 21:25.985
'cause I was gonna come off
of these sticks
and I was gonna...

21:26.018 --> 21:27.987
I was... uh...

21:28.020 --> 21:30.723
Yeah, thanks.
I think I owe you one.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.025
Name's Scarecrow.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.061
I'm Dorothy.
And that's Toto.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.996
Mm-mm. Hola!

21:37.029 --> 21:39.399
Um... You got any butter?
Oh, what the hey?

21:39.432 --> 21:43.069
Go ahead and eat the corn.
Better you than the birds.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.806
I'm the worst scarecrow ever,
but what can I do?

21:46.839 --> 21:51.344
I'm tied to a job
I'm no good at... literally.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.847
Well, if you ask me,
I think it's time
for a career change.

21:54.881 --> 21:58.418
No, no. I can't do that.
I'm not good at anything
because...

22:01.053 --> 22:03.523
(whispers)
...I don't have a brain.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.058
You don't have a brain?
Right.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.928
Why are you whispering?
What?

22:08.961 --> 22:12.465
Uh... well, I can't really
answer that because...

22:14.100 --> 22:16.803
I don't have a brain.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.805
Well, let's get you
down from there.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.740
Now, why didn't I
think of that?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.410
Oh, right. No brain.
Whoa!

22:23.443 --> 22:26.479
Oh, why, thank you, Dorothy.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.847
You're welcome, Scarecrow.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.048
(burps)

22:29.081 --> 22:31.818
This was me.
Ugh!

22:31.851 --> 22:34.854
What? What?
You can smell it?

22:34.887 --> 22:37.524
You know, we're on our way
to meet the Wizard of Oz

22:37.557 --> 22:39.892
and he's gonna make me
a superstar singer.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.862
And if he can do that,
I bet he can give you a brain.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.832
If I had a brain,
I wouldn't be stupid.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.669
And if I wasn't stupid,
I'd be able to do
something important.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.738
You know, something
that helps people's lives.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.673
Well, how about it, then?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.675
Will you come with us
to Emerald City
to meet the wizard?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.010
Emerald?
You mean, it's green?

22:58.044 --> 23:00.747
You bet!
I like it already.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.815
I can't believe.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.017
Thank you.
I can't believe.

23:05.051 --> 23:09.188
She's got to pick up
every Tom, Dick and Carlos
on the road, OK.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.524
This is totally
unacceptable, OK.
These shoes are killing me.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.460
Totally unacceptable.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.662
Come on, come on.
Quit busting my shell, OK.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.865
My client is A-list now,
she deserves
the A-list monies, OK.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.568
Will you knock it off!
You're not an agent.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.837
And the cell phone
isn't even real.
What?

23:24.871 --> 23:26.573
It's a candy dispenser.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.478
Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.580
The diva's having
a meltdown, OK.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.849
Ooh! Cinnamints.
Hey, do you hear that?

23:36.883 --> 23:39.586
(engine)
Sounds like it's coming
from over there.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.591
"T-i-n."
Wonder what that means.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.627
Maybe, "trust in no one."
It could be a sign.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.162
Yeah, there's another sign:
"Danger. High Voltage."

23:50.196 --> 23:52.532
Wonder what that means? Hmm.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.503
(door creaks)

23:59.839 --> 24:02.174
Hello?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.711
Look! Look at
all the computers, OK.
Yeah.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.148
(Scarecrow) Is there somebody
in that chair?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.684
There's somebody
in that chair!

24:11.718 --> 24:15.087
Dios mío! He's twitching,
he's twitching.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.256
Think he's stuck?
You think he needs
our help?

24:17.289 --> 24:20.259
Do you think he could
check my e-mails?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.830
Maybe we should press
this restart button.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.467
(computers humming)

24:29.969 --> 24:32.104
Hey! Hey.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.907
Oh, my God.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.509
Oh! Oh!

24:36.543 --> 24:38.645
Welcome to the Total
Intelligence Network.

24:38.678 --> 24:41.814
"TIN" for short.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.983
Ooh!

24:44.016 --> 24:47.053
Wow, I must have froze up
trying to run too many programs.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.590
What in the name
of all that is holy
are you, OK?

24:50.623 --> 24:53.593
Oh, I'm a Tin Thing.
A fully-robotic
information-gathering device

24:53.626 --> 24:55.261
for the Wicked Witch
of the West,

24:55.294 --> 24:57.797
and I can answer any
question in the universe.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.799
Anything.
I got one.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.535
Why are the women
so confusing, OK?

25:02.569 --> 25:04.971
Let me process that. Huh!

25:07.039 --> 25:08.775
(grunting)

25:08.808 --> 25:11.143
(sighs)

25:11.177 --> 25:14.180
It only seems that way
because men are so simple.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.583
Wow. He is
a clever unit.
Hmm.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.251
Yeah, you know,
I'd give my stuffed foot
for half of your brains.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.988
Take it from me -
brains don't make you happy.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.190
I'm nothing but a brain,
thanks to the Wicked Witch.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.826
She made you like this?
Did she ever!

25:26.859 --> 25:28.260
When I was a young
research assistant,

25:28.294 --> 25:30.663
I made the mistake
of asking for a vacation

25:30.697 --> 25:34.233
so I could marry
the love of my life Camilla.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.003
(Toto) She's a chicken?
Weirdo.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.638
And the Wicked Witch
got so angry,

25:38.671 --> 25:41.741
she waved her wand
and ka-blowie!

25:41.774 --> 25:46.746
Next thing I know,
I'm a walking, talking
robotic... thing.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.815
Oh! That's terrible.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.850
Yeah, she could have
just said no.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.685
Yeah, but why did she
turn you into a robot?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.754
Because...
(hollow knock)

25:54.787 --> 25:56.689
...robots don't have hearts,

25:56.723 --> 25:58.691
and without a heart,
I couldn't love Camilla.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.360
And without Camilla,
I could work day and night.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.294
(sighs)

26:02.328 --> 26:07.199
Well, nice talking to you.
Back to work.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.737
Um, excuse me.
Mm? Huh?

26:10.770 --> 26:12.805
We're on our way to see
the Wizard of Oz

26:12.839 --> 26:14.173
and he's gonna make
me a famous singer.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.708
Yeah, and he's gonna
give me a brain.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.077
Sí, and he probably give me
lots of monies, OK.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.681
And if he can do that,
I'm sure he can give you
a heart.

26:21.714 --> 26:25.017
Really? Well, I'm sure
if I had a heart,
I could win Camilla back.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.353
Yeah!
Maybe I will go with you.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.189
All right, well, let's go!
All right!

26:30.222 --> 26:32.058
Aah!

26:32.091 --> 26:34.661
(grunts) Oh!

26:34.694 --> 26:38.665
Are you OK?
Sure, I just forgot
to untether. Heh-heh.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.267
I don't get out much. OK.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.102
Oh, where's my cell phone?

26:43.135 --> 26:45.872
Ah!
(beeps)

26:45.905 --> 26:47.940
OK.
OK.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.409
Let's go.
Wait a second.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.411
That's your cell phone?
Yeah.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.014
Interesting.
What do these do?

26:55.047 --> 26:57.383
(squeaking)
Nothing.
They're my nipples.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.988
(moans)

27:03.389 --> 27:05.024
(yells)

27:06.425 --> 27:09.161
I feel dirty!

27:09.195 --> 27:12.198
What a weirdo.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.700
(hoots)

27:13.733 --> 27:15.267
(animals yelping)

27:19.105 --> 27:21.240
This creepy forest
goes on forever.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.942
(all) You can say that again.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.444
Anyone know how much further?
My feet are killing me.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.081
I gotta sit down.
(Toto) Sí, me too.
Scoot over.

27:29.115 --> 27:32.118
(Tin Thing) Oh, boy.

27:32.151 --> 27:36.022
These shoes may be magical,
but they're not so comfortable.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.157
Sí, they can put a trailer
in Munchkinland

27:38.190 --> 27:40.059
but they can't make
a magic shoe
that's comfortable.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.828
Go figure.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.963
(log) Ouch!

27:43.996 --> 27:47.466
This place is crazy.
Even the logs talk.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.069
Hmm?

27:50.102 --> 27:53.305
Uh, Dorothy?
Yeah?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.842
What is...?

27:55.875 --> 27:58.044
What do you...?
Lion?
Shrimp?

27:58.077 --> 28:00.146
No, prawn.
Oh, prawn.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.814
(both scream)

28:01.848 --> 28:03.249
Toto!

28:03.282 --> 28:05.017
(continue screaming)

28:07.353 --> 28:10.256
(Lion) Get... off...
OK.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.024
...my... tail!
Oh! OK!

28:12.058 --> 28:14.160
(screaming)

28:14.193 --> 28:15.327
Hey!

28:15.361 --> 28:17.096
Get your paws off my prawn!

28:20.299 --> 28:22.802
Please don't hit me.
Take anything you want.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.404
Here, my wallet.
It's Velcro. Take it.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.243
Well, look at you.
You're nothing
but a big coward.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.246
So are you going
to eat me or not?

28:34.280 --> 28:38.017
Eat you?
Why would we do that?
Don't you work for...

28:38.050 --> 28:40.252
She Who Must Not Be Named?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.290
Who?
Oh! You mean the Wicked
Witch of the West?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.958
No, we don't even like her.

28:45.992 --> 28:50.863
B-b-b-because we love her
so much! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.933
Are you crazy?
The Wicked Witch of the West
has spies everywhere.

28:53.966 --> 28:58.237
The trees, the shrubs,
the owls, the bunnies.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.941
Evil, savage bunnies.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.110
(sinister laughter)

29:06.412 --> 29:09.048
(Dorothy) You're king
of the beasts.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.917
If some critter
gives you attitude,
all you gotta do is

29:10.950 --> 29:13.920
let out a big roar.
(both) Yeah.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.856
But I don't want to scare
anyone. I just want
to make people laugh.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.225
Yeah. Kill 'em with comedy -
that's my motto.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.328
I dream of one day being Oz's
greatest stand-up comedian.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.463
Well, you ever play
Emerald City?

29:24.496 --> 29:27.299
I've never played, period.
I've got stage fright.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.802
OK. Tell us a joke now.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.138
There's no stage.
Yeah, go ahead.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.140
No, I can't...
Come on.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.475
OK. I can do this. Um...

29:36.508 --> 29:38.110
(drumroll)

29:38.144 --> 29:40.813
Wacka, wacka, wacka!

29:40.847 --> 29:42.348
Hey, there.
Thanks for coming tonight.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.350
So, what's the deal
with the wizard?

29:44.383 --> 29:48.054
For someone so wonderful,
he certainly doesn't know
how to...

29:48.087 --> 29:49.321
(stammers)

29:49.355 --> 29:51.824
S-s-sorry.
Performance anxiety.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.560
(gasps for air)

29:54.593 --> 29:56.829
Hey, you know,
we're on our way
to Emerald City

29:56.863 --> 29:58.965
to ask the wizard
for some help.
(Scarecrow) Mm-hmm.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.333
Maybe he can give you
some courage.
Courage?

30:01.367 --> 30:04.436
Gosh, that sounds...
scary.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.339
Oh, don't worry.
It'll be OK.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.877
Yeah, I mean, so you're not
so brave. I'm not so smart.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.112
And I'm so empty inside,
I could cry.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.314
Sí, and I'm so gosh-darn sexy,
it hurts.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.916
See, we all have our issues.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.385
But we're working 'em out...
together.
Yeah.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.254
Right. I mean,
what are friends for?

30:22.288 --> 30:24.390
* Where my brain should be

30:24.423 --> 30:26.625
* There's a cavity

30:26.658 --> 30:28.895
* Where most folks
have hearts

30:28.928 --> 30:31.397
* I've got old spare parts

30:33.499 --> 30:35.634
* Now I'm on my own

30:35.667 --> 30:40.472
* In the great unknown

30:40.506 --> 30:44.176
* And it's more than
one person can bear

30:44.210 --> 30:46.578
Bear?
Ah! Where?

30:46.612 --> 30:50.082
* Well, now I've got
some smart new partners

30:50.116 --> 30:53.986
* Who can help me
think things through

30:54.020 --> 30:56.455
* Folks say I'm just
a hick on a stick

30:56.488 --> 30:58.557
* Well, that may be true
Sí, it's true.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.560
* But when my stuffing's
not enough

31:01.593 --> 31:05.531
* I know just what I should
do-la-dee-doo

31:05.564 --> 31:08.100
* See, I don't miss
the brains I'm missing

31:08.134 --> 31:11.370
* When I'm with you

31:11.403 --> 31:14.406
* I used to be
romance compatible

31:14.440 --> 31:17.509
* I wrote sonnets
and waltzes and more

31:17.543 --> 31:20.446
* But now that my heart
is mechanical

31:20.479 --> 31:23.515
* It only beats
four-on-the-floor

31:23.549 --> 31:25.617
(Tin Thing makes
drumming noise)
(Lion) Oh, nice!

31:25.651 --> 31:29.188
* But you've got friends
to stand beside you

31:29.221 --> 31:32.191
* And we'll reboot
your old CPU

31:32.224 --> 31:35.127
* Wow! I don't miss
the heart I'm missing

31:35.161 --> 31:38.630
* When I'm with you

31:38.664 --> 31:41.500
* I wish my stage fright
weren't so terrible

31:41.533 --> 31:44.503
* My jokes never garner a roar

31:44.536 --> 31:47.639
* With us you can try
new material

31:47.673 --> 31:53.412
* You see,
that's what friends are for

31:53.445 --> 31:56.515
* Now you can sleep
without a night-light

31:56.548 --> 31:58.150
* And forget every...

31:58.184 --> 32:00.019
* Creak, bang and boo!

32:00.052 --> 32:02.554
* Hey! I don't miss
the spine I'm missing

32:02.588 --> 32:05.657
* When I'm with you

32:05.691 --> 32:09.161
* Still we've got
something great together

32:09.195 --> 32:12.498
* So let's all get up and go

32:12.531 --> 32:14.233
* We'll overachieve

32:14.266 --> 32:15.968
* Wear our hearts on our sleeves

32:16.002 --> 32:18.604
* Get on with the show

32:18.637 --> 32:21.974
* Now we are
in the right direction

32:22.008 --> 32:25.311
* And I see all our dreams
coming true

32:25.344 --> 32:28.547
* Yes, anything is possible

32:28.580 --> 32:31.317
* When I'm with you

32:31.350 --> 32:34.320
* I'm just so sexy!
Wow, a shrimp
that shimmies!

32:34.353 --> 32:37.389
* Our act's unfloppable
* Troubles are hoppable

32:37.423 --> 32:40.526
* It's all so logical
* We'll be unstoppable

32:40.559 --> 32:43.195
* Cashmere is washable
* Anything is possible

32:43.229 --> 32:45.131
* When I'm

32:45.164 --> 32:49.768
* With you

32:49.801 --> 32:51.570
* I'm with you

32:53.205 --> 32:55.074
* I'm with you

32:56.208 --> 32:59.345
* I'm with you

32:59.378 --> 33:01.280
* I'm with...

33:02.581 --> 33:05.151
* You

33:05.184 --> 33:07.086
Great!
Let's go!

33:07.119 --> 33:08.754
(Dorothy) Come on, guys.
(Toto) Let's get rich,
come on!

33:08.787 --> 33:10.156
(Tin Thing)
Come on, Dorothy!

33:12.624 --> 33:15.127
It's dark.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.096
Anybody got a night-light?

33:17.129 --> 33:18.397
(all gasp)

33:22.434 --> 33:25.804
Just to let you know,
nothing scares me
more than heights.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.574
(laughter)

33:28.607 --> 33:30.309
(Tin Thing) There's a pair
of vicious Kalidah Critics.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.111
Very rare in these parts.

33:32.144 --> 33:36.648
Those monstrous beasts
just love to rip performers
to shreds.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.551
Really? How?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.687
They do it with their...
(gulps)

33:41.720 --> 33:43.522
words.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.558
So, all we gotta do is
ignore their words

33:46.592 --> 33:48.727
and keep our balance
all the way to other side.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.163
That's right.
What?

33:51.197 --> 33:52.698
What are you...?

33:52.731 --> 33:54.766
You're going to cross?
Follow me.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.635
Dorothy, don't.
You're going to cross?

33:56.668 --> 33:58.637
(critic) You're gonna
fall off!
You're gonna fall!

33:58.670 --> 34:02.541
You're gonna fall!
It's a long way down!

34:02.574 --> 34:05.611
Hey, that's Dorothy Gale,
the new overnight sensation.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.146
She's really killing 'em
in Munchkinland.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.215
Just ask the Wicked Witch
of the East.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.750
I hear she's really
bringing down the houses.

34:11.783 --> 34:15.221
(Tin Thing) Shut up!
Dorothy. Concentrate, Dorothy.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.755
She made it!
Whoo!

34:17.789 --> 34:19.358
All right, let's go.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.627
You go first.
OK. You go next.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.661
(critic) I hear
it's lonely at the top.
(critic #2) Yeah.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.297
Wait till
he hits the bottom.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.266
I did it, OK.
That was easy for me.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.101
(Tin Thing) That's it,
that's it.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.438
One things for sure about
playing the Kalidah Bridge.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.306
You're sure to make
a big splash!

34:35.341 --> 34:38.310
It's not that far down,
anyway.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.712
We made it! We made it!

34:40.746 --> 34:44.283
OK, come on there, Lion.
Come on, Lion.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.518
Nice log.
(critic) Be careful -
it's slippery up there!

34:47.553 --> 34:49.855
Ooh, I feel a wind
coming on!

34:49.888 --> 34:52.858
Oh, there's Lion.
He thinks he's a comedian.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.860
Yeah, but his jokes
bomb so badly,

34:54.893 --> 34:57.896
the army tried
to put a fuse on him!

34:57.929 --> 35:00.699
Whoa, whoa! Ahh...

35:03.269 --> 35:05.304
You know, there are
two reasons why I don't
like Lion's jokes.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.274
What are they?
My ears.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.377
I can't do it. I can't do it!
I can't do it, guys.
I can't move!

35:11.410 --> 35:15.381
Ignore them.
What they're saying
has nothing to do with you.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.284
What? Unless there's another
lion up here on this log,

35:18.317 --> 35:19.851
I think they're talking to me.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.521
I just think he needs
a little help. I'm going up.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.890
Be careful.
Come on.

35:24.923 --> 35:28.160
(critic) Yeah, your jokes
are no good!
(critic #2) You're not funny!

35:28.194 --> 35:30.462
Pay no attention
to your critics.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.331
It's gonna be one step
at a time, OK?

35:32.364 --> 35:36.302
Now take my hand.
Put your tail down.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.371
Calm yourself.
Now take my hand, come on.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.773
That's it. Now we're
just gonna walk off.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.942
Come on. We're just walking.
Hang on!

35:43.975 --> 35:46.345
That's it. Steady.
You can do it!
You can do it!

35:46.378 --> 35:48.614
You're all right.
Come on, you've got it.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.849
You've got it. Yes!

35:54.386 --> 35:57.489
Oh, thank you, Tin Thing.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.725
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.294
Go on, get out of here!

36:02.328 --> 36:05.564
Yeah, you'll still
never make it
to where you're going.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.734
Good work, Lion.
Wasn't he great, guys?

36:08.767 --> 36:10.336
He sure was.
I don't know.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.837
Hey, what's that, guys?

36:14.806 --> 36:16.475
"Poppyfields."
What's that?

36:19.245 --> 36:22.281
Poppyfields? Well, it's only
the coolest club in Oz, baby.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.450
This day has been
kind of crazy.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.385
It wouldn't hurt to stop
and have a little fun.

36:26.418 --> 36:30.622
A little fun?
Get ready to have the time
of your life, girl.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.525
Come on, Dorothy.
Let's get inside before
this place is no longer cool.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.461
Yeah. After you.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.396
(* funky jazz)

36:51.843 --> 36:55.013
Heh-heh-heh.
All right now,
y'all follow me.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.915
I'll put you
in the best seats
in the house.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.217
Sounds great!

37:05.824 --> 37:08.594
* Nap time

37:08.627 --> 37:10.729
You know, I can't wait
till I get a brain
so I can understand

37:10.762 --> 37:12.864
what's fun about hanging out
at trendy nightclubs.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.000
Yeah. What's the deal with
all these poppies anyway?

37:15.033 --> 37:17.569
Whoa.
Wait, here comes a fact.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.939
According to my database,
the poppy has a powerful
sleep-inducing effect.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.375
Sleep-inducing effect?
Oh, that's silly.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.010
How could a little
flower...?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.579
(snores)

37:27.613 --> 37:29.815
(Tin Thing) Lion?
(Scarecrow) Lion, are you OK?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.451
Lion?
Is he all right?

37:32.484 --> 37:35.287
He's fine. You know what?

37:35.321 --> 37:37.689
We don't need to go
to Emerald City.

37:37.723 --> 37:41.493
We should just stay here
at Poppyfields,

37:41.527 --> 37:44.496
where it's so... relaxing.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.733
Dorothy!
Dorothy!

37:47.766 --> 37:50.636
Dorothy.
Dorothy, wake up.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.839
Dorothy! Lion!
Why won't they wake up?

37:53.872 --> 37:56.642
Why won't they wake up?
I don't know!

37:56.675 --> 38:00.612
You know, the bathrooms here
are so comfortable, OK.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.014
(yawns)

38:03.048 --> 38:05.351
It's the poppies.
Come on, let's get Toto
out of here

38:05.384 --> 38:07.018
and then we can figure out
what to do about Dorothy
and Lion.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.721
OK.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.890
Come on.
You grab that arm
right there.

38:11.923 --> 38:15.327
Nap time.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.696
Ooh, I'm so sleepy, OK.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.798
If something happens
to Dorothy,

38:19.831 --> 38:21.833
I don't think I'll ever be
able to forgive myself.

38:21.867 --> 38:25.604
I know, but we can't
carry them out of there.
We have to think.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.539
Oh, rats! I'm no good
at thinking.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.908
Whoo, rats!
Rats in hats.

38:29.941 --> 38:33.379
What?
They said they could...
could help us.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.913
Wait! How? How?
How?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.015
By singing the song.
What?

38:37.048 --> 38:39.785
You know, it goes...

38:39.818 --> 38:41.553
Wait! Sing the song!
How does the song go?

38:41.587 --> 38:42.921
* Calling all Munchkins

38:42.954 --> 38:44.456
* Let's do lunchkins
Yeah?

38:44.490 --> 38:46.992
* All for one
and one for all

38:47.025 --> 38:48.494
* Come on...

38:48.527 --> 38:49.928
Come on, finish it!
Come on, come on!

38:49.961 --> 38:52.130
* Munchkins take our...

38:52.163 --> 38:53.565
What? What?

38:53.599 --> 38:54.966
* ...call

38:55.000 --> 38:57.736
Somebody page me?

38:57.769 --> 39:00.672
Dorothy's in trouble.
Poppy exposure.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.642
Poppies? Rats!
Munchkins, fall in!

39:03.675 --> 39:05.477
We've got a girl to save.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.481
(all) Sir, yes, sir!

39:09.515 --> 39:10.816
Sergeant Bubba.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.585
Company, heel!

39:13.619 --> 39:16.021
Nice.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.824
All right, troops,
Operation Gingham's a go!

39:18.857 --> 39:20.926
(chattering)

39:20.959 --> 39:23.395
(muffled)

39:30.001 --> 39:31.837
* Nap time

39:36.675 --> 39:38.810
(Munchkins chant) Hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

39:38.844 --> 39:40.912
hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut,

39:40.946 --> 39:43.749
hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.485
(* all sing muffled
military cadence)

39:51.222 --> 39:52.924
* Nap time

39:52.958 --> 39:55.594
Oh, Dorothy, please don't
be hurt. Wake up!

39:55.627 --> 39:57.663
OK, out of the way, peoples.
Out of the way.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.598
It's time for Toto to give
the mouth-to-mouth.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.767
I'll get the Dorothy,
you get the lion, OK.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.103
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I have a better idea.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.506
Charging!

40:07.539 --> 40:09.541
And clear!
(beeping and buzzing)

40:12.978 --> 40:14.546
I'm up.
I'm totally up!

40:14.580 --> 40:17.916
All right, she's alive.
What happened?

40:17.949 --> 40:21.553
Well, it's lucky for you
the Munchkins showed up.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.889
Thanks. I don't know
what came over me.

40:23.922 --> 40:28.026
I'd say about maybe
20,000 volts there, Medusa.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.095
(yawns)

40:30.128 --> 40:31.897
Oh, big cat waking up, boys.
Time to go.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.032
Good luck in Emerald City
there, Giant Girl.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.002
(smacks lips)

40:37.035 --> 40:38.670
What'd I miss?

40:38.704 --> 40:40.939
Aah!

40:40.972 --> 40:43.675
(laughs)

40:43.709 --> 40:45.544
Very funny, guys.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.479
Next time you could at least
tell me about my...

40:47.513 --> 40:49.748
(gasps)

40:49.781 --> 40:52.450
(Tin Thing) Emerald City!
Look at it!

40:54.920 --> 40:56.888
It's so beautiful!

40:56.922 --> 40:58.890
And yet so terrifying
all at the same time.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.860
Heh-heh.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.695
Wow.

41:06.064 --> 41:10.001
Well, this is the place.
Whoa!

41:10.035 --> 41:13.872
We made it, Dorothy.
Your dream's about
to come true.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.575
OK, we agree now

41:16.608 --> 41:21.580
what happens in Emerald City
stays in Emerald City, OK.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.616
(door opening)

41:44.936 --> 41:46.705
Can I help you?

41:46.738 --> 41:49.007
Hi. I'm Dorothy Gale,

41:49.040 --> 41:52.277
and we traveled all the way
across Oz to see the wizard.

41:52.310 --> 41:56.181
Hmm...
Dorothy Gale. Hmm...

41:56.214 --> 41:58.283
Nope. Not on the list.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.285
Are you sure? Check again.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.624
And who are you?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.626
We're friends
of Dorothy.
Right.

42:07.659 --> 42:11.663
Well, she's not on the list,
so go away.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.131
Uh...

42:13.164 --> 42:15.601
Hold on a minute, big bird.
Come here. Listen, listen.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.570
(guard) Huh.
(whispering)

42:18.604 --> 42:20.105
Mm-hmm. Oh!

42:20.138 --> 42:24.209
Flattened by a double-wide?
Oh! Oh! Oh!

42:24.242 --> 42:27.746
We don't want any trouble.
Um...

42:27.779 --> 42:29.815
Oh, there's just been
a cancellation.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.349
You may go in.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.552
Oh, great!
(guard) Door!

43:07.352 --> 43:09.120
Weirdoes...
(muffled whispering)

43:09.154 --> 43:11.389
Gale... (muffled whispering)
double-wide...

43:11.422 --> 43:13.158
(clears throat)

43:13.191 --> 43:15.293
They're all yours, sir.

43:17.963 --> 43:21.366
Hello!
Wait.
You're the Wizard of Oz?

43:21.399 --> 43:26.337
Oh, no. I'm not the wizard.
I'm Scooter.

43:26.371 --> 43:29.140
First assistant
to the big man.

43:29.174 --> 43:31.209
Welcome, Dorothy.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.679
Why, we've heard
a lot about you.

43:33.712 --> 43:36.081
You're all anyone's
talking about.
Ah!

43:36.114 --> 43:38.416
Really?
Great! That's terrific!

43:38.449 --> 43:42.053
Yeah, but before
the wizard can turn you
into an overnight sensation,

43:42.087 --> 43:44.656
there are certain precautions
that have to be taken.

43:44.690 --> 43:48.126
Precautions?
Yup. Follow me.
Come on.

43:48.159 --> 43:49.327
Let's go.
Follow him.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.163
OK, here we are.
Come on in.

43:52.197 --> 43:55.767
Oh, welcome to Emerald City,
where the place is so bright,

43:55.801 --> 43:59.104
you've got to wear shades
or your eyeballs will fry
like a couple of eggs.

43:59.137 --> 44:01.840
(meeping)

44:01.873 --> 44:03.875
This spotlight here
duplicates the brilliance
of the wizard

44:03.909 --> 44:06.211
and his radiant wonderfulness.
Radiant wonderfulness.

44:06.244 --> 44:09.414
Radiant wonderfulness.

44:09.447 --> 44:12.751
As you can see, thanks
to my patented lenses,

44:12.784 --> 44:14.686
Beaker's retinas
remain uncooked.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.822
(meeping)

44:16.855 --> 44:18.890
(meeps)

44:18.924 --> 44:21.159
And they will still
protect his eyes

44:21.192 --> 44:22.694
even when the intensity
is doubled.

44:22.728 --> 44:24.796
(meeps and yelps)

44:26.998 --> 44:28.466
Good grief!

44:28.499 --> 44:30.969
(scientist) OK, give me
the glasses.

44:33.171 --> 44:36.842
(pop)
(all gasp)

44:36.875 --> 44:39.845
So, do we get
to see the wizard now?

44:39.878 --> 44:42.413
Oh, well, if you want
to be the next big thing,

44:42.447 --> 44:45.050
you've got to look the part.

44:45.083 --> 44:49.087
Welcome to Emerald City's
Magical Makeover Machine.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.289
Oh, wow.

44:51.322 --> 44:54.025
You want me
to go in there?
Absolutely.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.227
No way! You just fried
that guy's head off.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.196
(whimpering)

45:02.100 --> 45:04.736
Well, you can't go
see the wizard looking
like that.

45:04.770 --> 45:07.739
I mean, what is that,
a tablecloth?
Check, please.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.475
(laughing)

45:10.508 --> 45:12.944
(all stop laughing)

45:14.813 --> 45:17.182
Fine. I'll get in
your makeover machine.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.720
She's in.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.960
(Dorothy) Hey! What is that?

45:28.994 --> 45:30.929
Ow!

45:30.962 --> 45:32.898
Hey!

45:40.171 --> 45:42.240
This is cool.
I can work with this.

45:42.273 --> 45:44.009
Look! You've been reborn!

45:44.042 --> 45:47.913
Correction -
you've been Osbourne!
(Scooter laughs)

45:47.946 --> 45:49.948
Good one.
So, what do you guys think?

45:49.981 --> 45:53.251
Uh, well...
It's really nice.
It's nice.

45:53.284 --> 45:55.453
Different.
Sí, sí.

45:55.486 --> 45:59.090
But you know, this is
the Kelly Osbourne thing
I think that you're doing,

45:59.124 --> 46:01.259
but I think we all thought
you were going for more of

46:01.292 --> 46:04.295
the hot and sexy
Ashanti thing.

46:04.329 --> 46:06.832
Ashanti.
Ashanti, yeah.

46:06.865 --> 46:09.334
Fine. I'll get back
in your stupid machine.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.852
(wolf whistle)

46:26.885 --> 46:28.019
Oh!

46:28.053 --> 46:30.989
Now you're talking, baby!
Beautiful!

46:31.022 --> 46:33.959
What do you think?
Oh, my!

46:36.928 --> 46:39.164
She's ready to see
the wizard now.

46:39.197 --> 46:42.133
Come on! Follow me!
Come on!

46:42.167 --> 46:44.535
All right.
OK. Walk this way.
Come on.

46:44.569 --> 46:47.105
Fabulous.
Wow.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.440
(man) Who are those
who seek an audience

46:49.474 --> 46:51.576
with the all-powerful
Wizard of Oz?

46:51.609 --> 46:54.212
First, bring in the lion.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.248
The lion?
Wait. Stop. Hold on.

46:57.282 --> 47:00.886
Wait, wait, wait!
You heard him, Lion.
You gotta go in first now.

47:15.300 --> 47:18.536
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

47:21.272 --> 47:25.610
A wave of relaxation is flowing
throughout your body.

47:25.643 --> 47:28.113
A feeling of peace and...

47:30.015 --> 47:32.183
Don't wet the floor!
Don't wet the floor!

47:32.217 --> 47:35.486
Scooter, is there
a bathroom?
(door locks and Lion wails)

47:35.520 --> 47:37.455
Scooter?

47:41.192 --> 47:43.294
(Lion gasps)

47:47.665 --> 47:51.202
I am Oz,
the great and terrible.

47:51.236 --> 47:55.073
Who are you,
and why do you seek me?

47:55.106 --> 47:56.407
I... I...

47:56.441 --> 47:59.477
I wanna be a stand-up comedian.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.612
Really?
Yes, sir.

48:01.646 --> 48:03.982
Well, then, tell me a joke.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.551
No, I-I-I can't do that.

48:06.584 --> 48:09.320
I... I...
I have stage fright.

48:09.354 --> 48:11.222
I kind of lack courage
in general, actually.

48:11.256 --> 48:14.960
Tell me a joke now!

48:14.993 --> 48:17.628
Aah! Why did the Wicked Witch
throw a clock out the window
to see time fly?

48:17.662 --> 48:21.166
No, wait, stop.
I mean, when the witch
had a clock and she threw it...

48:21.199 --> 48:24.269
Aah! Wacka, wacka!

48:24.302 --> 48:27.372
(sinister laugh)

48:27.405 --> 48:28.339
Next.

48:36.982 --> 48:41.219
I am Oz,
the great and terrible.

48:41.252 --> 48:42.620
What do you want?

48:42.653 --> 48:45.957
(whimpers)
Hi, there, Mr. Oz. Um...

48:45.991 --> 48:47.993
Are you, by chance,
any relation to Frank Oz?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.997
Aah!

48:52.030 --> 48:55.266
I'll, uh, I'll take that
as a no. Uh...

48:55.300 --> 48:59.304
Well, I'm here because I wanna
ask you for a... I, uh...

48:59.337 --> 49:02.140
Hurry up, brainless.
Oh! Oh!

49:02.173 --> 49:04.642
Yes, yes. A brain.
That's right, a brain.

49:04.675 --> 49:08.379
I'd really love
to have a brain. Uh...

49:08.413 --> 49:12.117
For my head.
You know, the old noggin.

49:12.150 --> 49:13.518
You're fired.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.422
Aah!

49:17.455 --> 49:21.126
(laughing)

49:21.159 --> 49:22.227
Next.

49:27.698 --> 49:31.636
Well, hello.
What is it you're looking for,

49:31.669 --> 49:36.241
tin, dark and handsome?

49:36.274 --> 49:38.509
Actually, I'm here looking
for a heart.

49:38.543 --> 49:42.080
Oh, a heart.
(giggles)

49:48.386 --> 49:51.556
Are you sure
there isn't anything else
I can do you for?

49:51.589 --> 49:53.524
No, no, no. You see,
I already have a girlfriend.

49:53.558 --> 49:57.162
She's a chicken.
Oh, a chicken, eh?

49:57.195 --> 49:59.664
Yeah.

49:59.697 --> 50:03.568
Well, does she have
a big beak like this?

50:03.601 --> 50:05.203
How did you know?

50:05.236 --> 50:09.707
And does she have
huge floppy wings like this?

50:09.740 --> 50:14.079
Look at the size of those wings.
No, no, no, no, no.

50:14.112 --> 50:16.447
I'm not here for that.
Um... uh...

50:16.481 --> 50:20.017
I've just come here
to get a heart...
(clucking)

50:23.221 --> 50:25.323
Whoo! Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

50:26.857 --> 50:28.293
Next!

50:30.695 --> 50:32.463
(screams)

50:34.565 --> 50:36.534
Bye-bye.

50:36.567 --> 50:39.637
That's it! What are you
doing with my fr--

50:39.670 --> 50:40.738
Whoa.

50:40.771 --> 50:43.808
What? No hello?

50:43.841 --> 50:48.213
Ooh! Aren't you the little girl
who wanted to be a big star?

50:48.246 --> 50:51.749
Yeah. I heard that you were
all-great and powerful,

50:51.782 --> 50:54.685
and I came all this way
and I was kind of sort of
hoping that maybe--

50:54.719 --> 50:57.322
Blah-dee-blah.
Let's just cut to the chase.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.724
I am prepared to give you
all your heart desires -

50:59.757 --> 51:02.827
fame, hit records,

51:02.860 --> 51:05.796
and a tabloid story
linking you romantically

51:05.830 --> 51:08.466
to the famous person
of your choice.

51:08.499 --> 51:11.402
Really? Oh, God.
So, what do I gotta do?

51:11.436 --> 51:14.339
Oh, nothing, really.

51:14.372 --> 51:20.545
Just bring me
the Wicked Witch
of the West's magic eye!

51:20.578 --> 51:23.248
Eye, eye...

51:23.281 --> 51:26.117
I'm sorry, the what?

51:26.151 --> 51:31.122
The Wicked Witch of the West's
magic eye! Eye...

51:31.156 --> 51:33.291
Um...
OK...

51:33.324 --> 51:35.160
the Wicked Witch of the West
has this magic eye

51:35.193 --> 51:36.894
that gives her the power
to see all in Oz.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.364
If you cross
the mountains of death,

51:39.397 --> 51:41.799
remove her eye
and bring it back to me,

51:41.832 --> 51:47.338
your wildest dreams
shall come true.

51:47.372 --> 51:50.175
What about my friends?
Brains, hearts,

51:50.208 --> 51:53.278
courage - done!
If you bring me the eye.

51:53.311 --> 51:56.281
Jeez, you need anything else
while we're there?
A kidney or...

51:56.314 --> 51:58.383
Silence!

51:58.416 --> 52:01.352
That's the deal on the table.

52:01.386 --> 52:04.522
Now be gone from my sight!

52:09.194 --> 52:12.663
Ooh. Ooh.

52:12.697 --> 52:15.366
Uh... (clears throat)

52:15.400 --> 52:18.369
Um... This is embarrassing.

52:18.403 --> 52:22.740
Um... Would you mind, um...

52:22.773 --> 52:25.576
jumping?

52:26.877 --> 52:29.414
Uh... in there?

52:29.447 --> 52:33.184
Yeah. If you wouldn't mind.

52:33.218 --> 52:36.187
I guess.

52:36.221 --> 52:38.489
(screams)

52:38.523 --> 52:41.759
Excuse me. Are you busy?

52:41.792 --> 52:44.262
Uh... I thought
she'd never leave, OK.

52:44.295 --> 52:48.399
So for me, I would like
a date with JLo, of course.

52:48.433 --> 52:51.402
Nothing too serious.
Maybe a little something
between marriages.

52:51.436 --> 52:52.703
(roars)

52:52.737 --> 52:54.339
Aah!

52:54.372 --> 52:55.873
(laughs)

52:55.906 --> 52:57.375
(banging and screaming)

52:57.408 --> 52:59.577
Do you guys hear
something?
Santa Maria!

53:04.515 --> 53:06.917
Oh, dear.
Oh, gracias, gracias.

53:06.951 --> 53:08.919
Hey, good news, everyone.

53:08.953 --> 53:11.856
The wizard is going to grant
all our wishes, OK!

53:11.889 --> 53:14.292
Yes!
Yes!

53:14.325 --> 53:16.427
Yes, that's great!
Toto, I think
I should tell 'em...

53:16.461 --> 53:19.664
And all we have to do is
cross the mountains of death,

53:19.697 --> 53:22.567
poke out the Wicked Witch's eye
and give it to the wizard!

53:28.473 --> 53:30.508
It could happen.

53:32.377 --> 53:33.611
(wild dogs howling)

53:33.644 --> 53:35.513
Stupid wizard.

53:35.546 --> 53:38.583
Make us climb
the stupid mountains
to find the stupid witch.

53:38.616 --> 53:41.919
Yeah! And I was very clear
about being a cowardly lion.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.921
Mm-hmm.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.756
I didn't know I'd have to
do something like this

53:45.790 --> 53:47.892
to become a famous singer.

53:47.925 --> 53:49.894
I'm starting to think
maybe being a star

53:49.927 --> 53:51.696
isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.864
Wait a second.
Dorothy,

53:53.898 --> 53:57.268
you know you'll always
be a star with us, right?

53:57.302 --> 54:00.738
Thanks. I never thought
I'd say it, Scarecrow,

54:00.771 --> 54:04.775
but Kansas never
looked so good.

54:04.809 --> 54:08.313
I miss home.
I miss my family.
(sobbing)

54:08.346 --> 54:10.315
OK, OK. Boo-hoo,
boo-hoo, OK.

54:10.348 --> 54:14.385
I live in a stinking
algae-covered fishbowl
in a trailer park, OK.

54:14.419 --> 54:15.920
We're going to poke
the witch in the eye.

54:15.953 --> 54:19.324
End of story.

54:19.357 --> 54:22.293
Wah, wah, wah.
Poor me, poor me.
You guys are pathetic, OK.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.631
(Toto) Let's talk about
something else, OK?

54:26.664 --> 54:29.600
'Cause there's an amazing
coincidence happening here.

54:29.634 --> 54:32.970
It's incredible, really.
When you think about it,
it blows the mind.

54:33.003 --> 54:36.607
Kansas - '80s band.
Toto - '80s band.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.409
We're on a "Journey" -
'80s band.

54:38.443 --> 54:41.078
(witch) What have we here?
Intruders?

54:41.111 --> 54:44.081
...'80s band.
Oh, and when we
see the witch -

54:44.114 --> 54:46.551
"Wham!" - '80s band, OK.

54:46.584 --> 54:49.554
(witch) And what's this?
I can't believe
my own evil eye!

54:49.587 --> 54:51.456
How did she get
the silver shoes?

54:51.489 --> 54:53.858
I'm next in line to have 'em.

54:53.891 --> 54:56.394
Sal...

54:56.427 --> 54:58.663
Stupid dog.
Sal, you gotta be kidding me.

54:58.696 --> 55:00.531
You're not done yet?

55:00.565 --> 55:03.868
I'm sorry. Why can't we
just use regular water?

55:03.901 --> 55:06.371
(gibbers)

55:06.404 --> 55:09.607
All you need to know
is that the witch's
delicate diva pigskin

55:09.640 --> 55:11.676
can only handle
the nice bottled stuff.

55:11.709 --> 55:14.445
And, confidentially,
it ain't helping her.

55:14.479 --> 55:16.080
(laughter)

55:16.113 --> 55:19.083
(barking)
(sighs)

55:19.116 --> 55:21.619
Oh, hiya, sweetheart.
I just finished your
bottled-water bath.

55:21.652 --> 55:25.055
Cancel it. Change of plans.
I've just discovered
some new talent

55:25.089 --> 55:27.358
and it's right
in our own backyard.

55:27.392 --> 55:30.361
Isn't that right,
poo-poo kiss?

55:30.395 --> 55:34.098
That's wonderful.
Hey, maybe you two
could sing a duet. Hmm?

55:34.131 --> 55:36.066
A do what?
A do what?

55:36.100 --> 55:38.703
What are you talking about,
duets? She flies solo, Sal.

55:38.736 --> 55:40.538
Right, sugar patch?

55:40.571 --> 55:42.607
If I want those silver shoes,

55:42.640 --> 55:44.609
I'll have to pry 'em off
her cold, dead carcass.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.876
(barks)

55:45.910 --> 55:47.745
What's that?

55:47.778 --> 55:49.880
You want one of her bones
when I'm done with her?

55:49.914 --> 55:53.117
Oh, yes, of course, dear.
Yes!

55:53.150 --> 55:54.985
Bring me the magic
silver whistle.

55:55.019 --> 55:59.390
The man-eating wolves are going
to have an early supper tonight.

55:59.424 --> 56:01.058
(cackles)

56:04.429 --> 56:06.130
Pardon me, please. Yeah.

56:06.163 --> 56:10.100
The, uh...
the man-eating wolves
are on a, um ...

56:10.134 --> 56:12.002
ski vacation.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.671
Oh.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.841
Well, then bring me
the magic trumpet of death.

56:16.874 --> 56:20.177
I will send in the crows
of despair instead.

56:20.210 --> 56:22.046
(cackles)

56:22.079 --> 56:25.483
The crows of despair
are at a wedding.

56:25.516 --> 56:27.552
Yeah.
Huh?

56:27.585 --> 56:29.687
Angry bees?
Stomach flu.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.522
Vicious squirrels?
It's nut season.

56:31.556 --> 56:33.891
Blood-thirsty cockatoos?
Religious holiday.

56:33.924 --> 56:34.992
(sighs)

56:35.025 --> 56:39.564
All right. Bring me
my enchanted biker cap...
again!

56:41.866 --> 56:43.568
Round up the flying monkeys.

56:43.601 --> 56:46.170
There's only room
for one diva in Oz,

56:46.203 --> 56:48.138
and that's moi!

56:48.172 --> 56:50.641
(* hums dramatic music)

56:53.210 --> 56:55.813
Hah. Ahem.

56:55.846 --> 56:58.816
All right, guys, quit shoving.
Front and center.

57:02.219 --> 57:04.589
The flying monkeys
are ready to go, boss.

57:04.622 --> 57:07.625
Fabulous. I want the girl
caught and captured.

57:07.658 --> 57:10.928
If she resists...
destroy her.

57:10.961 --> 57:14.499
Really? Knock off a girl?
(witch laughs)

57:14.532 --> 57:17.602
I-I-I'm sorry.
What do you see on my head?

57:17.635 --> 57:20.905
(all) Enchanted biker cap.

57:20.938 --> 57:22.973
And what does it mean?

57:23.007 --> 57:26.076
Your wish is our command.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.078
Good. And gas up my ride, too.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.881
I wanna make sure
you knot-heads don't screw up.

57:30.915 --> 57:33.217
All right, you mugs.
Come on, let's go!

57:35.052 --> 57:37.087
(yelps)

57:37.121 --> 57:40.658
(* monkeys hum
"The Ride of the Valkyries")

57:50.067 --> 57:51.502
(sighs)

57:56.674 --> 57:58.509
The witch!

58:08.853 --> 58:10.921
Slow down, slow down,
slow down, slow down!

58:10.955 --> 58:12.890
Back it up.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.772
Well, well, well.

58:27.805 --> 58:30.841
Looks like someone forgot
to take out the trash.

58:30.875 --> 58:34.044
Trash? Pretty big talk
coming from a hog on a hog.

58:34.078 --> 58:35.646
(laughter)

58:41.351 --> 58:44.021
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, so clever.
Such wit.

58:44.054 --> 58:46.056
I know your type, missy.

58:46.090 --> 58:49.293
You sweet young things
come in with stars in your eyes,

58:49.326 --> 58:52.096
ready to show the world
what you've got.

58:52.129 --> 58:55.633
Well, now it's time
to clear the stage
for the real talent,

58:55.666 --> 58:59.203
'cause the diva gig's
a killer... and so am I.

58:59.236 --> 59:02.139
Hey, you can't talk
to my friend like that.

59:02.172 --> 59:04.241
Oh, yeah?
And who's gonna stop me?

59:05.643 --> 59:06.644
Um...

59:09.113 --> 59:11.015
He will.
Uh...

59:11.048 --> 59:13.918
Boo!

59:13.951 --> 59:16.120
It never really worked
on the crows either.

59:16.153 --> 59:17.988
Capture the girl
and the fur ball.

59:18.022 --> 59:20.157
I'm in the mood
for lion nuggets.

59:20.190 --> 59:23.861
As for the others,
shred 'em to pieces.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.963
But why?
They've done nothing to you.

59:25.996 --> 59:28.098
Why, you ask? Why?

59:28.132 --> 59:30.735
I'll tell you why,
in a song.

59:30.768 --> 59:33.070
Hit it!

59:34.872 --> 59:37.908
Um...

59:37.942 --> 59:40.310
Hmm. Nice digs.

59:40.344 --> 59:42.079
You're late!

59:42.112 --> 59:45.015
You know, like, not everyone
has groovy flying motorbikes,
OK?

59:45.049 --> 59:47.051
Not my problem.

59:47.084 --> 59:50.655
Yeah, we've been driving
the same lousy bus since 1978.

59:50.688 --> 59:53.023
We'll talk about it later!

59:53.057 --> 59:54.859
I...
Later!

59:56.961 --> 59:58.328
(grunting)

59:58.362 --> 59:59.697
Ah!

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.265
(grunting)

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:07.838
Get, get, get!
Sorry!

01:00:07.872 --> 01:00:10.007
(yelling and crashing)

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.915
Ready!
Hit it!

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:21.385
* Maybe I need to spell it out,
Dorothy Gale

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:25.823
* This is my show
Sorry, you fail

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.993
* There's only room
for one rock goddess in Oz

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.427
* You've lost your bloom

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.130
* Poor thing,
already a "was"

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:37.702
* Pay attention
Listen to moi

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:41.806
* This TV special is mine,
comme ça?

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.876
* So you can leave
the silver shoes at the door

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.913
* 'Cause the diva's
got the floor
Look out!

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:52.082
* The witch is in the house

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:55.152
* The witch is in the house
* The witch is in the house

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:58.889
* She's hot
The witch is in the house

01:00:58.923 --> 01:01:01.692
* This is my scene,
this is my set

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:05.730
* I may be gorgeous

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:07.197
* But I'm bad as they get
* She's hot

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:10.768
* You better run 'cause
you ain't seen nothing yet

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.336
* Watch out

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.773
* The witch is in the house

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:19.810
* Remember, missy,
the eye sees all

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:22.847
* Time to get down
on your knees and crawl

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.381
* You better stop

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:27.885
* You're gonna scream
and shout

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.788
* 'Cause mama's gonna
knock you out

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:33.290
* The witch is in the house

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:37.394
* The crazy, kooky house
* The witch is in the house

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.497
* The witch is in the house

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.168
* I don't forgive,
I never forget

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:49.073
* Think you can drop
another house on my head?

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:52.142
* You're gonna wish
that you were already dead

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:55.379
* Watch out
The witch is in the house

01:01:57.882 --> 01:02:00.785
* On a good day

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:04.488
* I'll have you begging
for mercy
* Mercy me

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:07.091
And let me tell ya,
when she comes home at night...
Oh, excuse me.

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:08.926
* On a bad day

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.061
* I'll make you wish
you were never born

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:14.431
* As I insult your wardrobe,
causing you such pain
and humiliation

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.400
* That you scream
from the depth of your soul

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.302
* As your eyes roll back
into your head
Eyes!

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:21.238
* And your toenails
carve grooves into
my Italian marble floor

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.507
Marble!
(laughs)

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.910
But I digress.
Digress.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:28.178
Two, three, four!
Get 'em, boys!

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:31.048
Come to Papa.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.450
(screaming)

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.089
I'll stop 'em.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.258
(screaming)

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:46.997
(alarm)

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:56.073
(monkeys) * Eye, eye,
eye, eye, eye

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.541
* The eye, oh, no

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.911
* The eye, eye, eye, eye
The eye sees all

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.813
* The eye, eye, eye, eye

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:05.983
* Here comes the eye

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.285
* The witch is in the house

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.822
* The witch is in the house

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:13.924
* Eye, eye, eye, eye
* The witch is in the house

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:15.893
(witch) * Now give it up,
I'm taking the shoes

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:19.964
* Audition's over
and this time you lose

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:22.933
* Look for all the gory details
on the ten o'clock news

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.301
* Watch out

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:26.837
* The witch is in the house

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:29.306
Watch out!
The witch is in the house.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.212
(revs engine)

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.281
(tires screech)

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:41.018
(Toto) Hey! I can't see!

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.321
I'm going to hyperventilate, OK.
I can't even see, OK.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.190
I'm going to hyperventilate.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.296
Whoo-hoo!
Nice meeting ya, fellas!

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.631
Too bad you went
to pieces on us!

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.400
(laughs)

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.186
Sal, let's go, let's go.
Come on. Time is money, huh?

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.925
We're on the air
in three, two...

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.592
Bonjour!

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:26.030
Witch of the West coming
at you from my lair of evil.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:29.133
Good news, fans.
In order to keep up
with the Joneses,

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:33.203
I've decided to lend my talent
to reality television.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.605
Today, you'll see me
do my hair,

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:38.108
take my daily
bottled-water bath,

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:40.410
and as an added bonus...

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.582
I'll try on
some awesome footwear

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.953
that will help me
totally rule all of Oz.

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.520
I'm never giving you
my shoes, Witch!

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.522
We'll see about that,
won't we?

01:04:58.128 --> 01:04:59.329
(Witch) Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:02.699
Why me? I don't have
the magic shoes! Why me?

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.568
(cries)

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:08.138
So, Dorothy,
any last words

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:11.942
before suffering
the agony of...

01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:13.944
"de-feat"?

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:16.113
Wait, wait! Hold that!
Wait, that's a great pun, honey.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:17.647
(Toto screams)

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.083
Ow!

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.585
Ow! Why are you poking me?

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.354
We're tenderizing you
so you taste better!

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:26.223
Oh, well, then...
(laughter)

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:33.463
He screamed good that time.
Are you sure
you want to eat me?

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.632
After all,
I am a stand-up comic.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.601
So?
So?

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:40.137
You should never
eat the comedian.
They taste funny.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.172
Ha!

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:46.076
Was that supposed
to be a joke?
Yes.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:49.313
But seriously, it must be tough
being a flying monkey, right?

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:52.216
Hey, you know why
your motorbikes won't
stand up on their own?

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.085
They're two-tired!
Wacka, wacka!

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:56.586
(moans)

01:05:58.655 --> 01:05:59.689
(laughter)

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:02.993
The motorbike has two tires!

01:06:03.027 --> 01:06:06.030
Two tires! (laughs)

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.364
It's funny on many levels.

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.438
(gibbers)

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.109
Dorothy.

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:21.345
Before I die, just once,

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.513
I want to hear a woman
say she loves me, OK?

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:26.516
Oh, Toto.
That's so sweet.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.718
Of course I love you.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:32.389
Uh... Look, Dorothy,
I'm flattered, OK.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.025
But I can't commit myself
to just one womens, OK.

01:06:35.059 --> 01:06:36.593
I hope we can still be friends.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:38.162
But you just told me
to tell you--
Sí, sí, sí.

01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:39.729
I know you're feeling hurt.
I understand.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.632
But time and a razor-sharp blade
cutting into your leg

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.001
will help you forget
all about me, OK.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:50.440
Oh, the womens.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.509
Oh, the razor blades.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:57.314
(screams)

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.050
(laughter)

01:07:00.084 --> 01:07:03.053
Hey, who here likes
comedy magic tricks?
Ooh, I do!

01:07:03.087 --> 01:07:04.721
OK!

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.157
I will need some keys.

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:10.794
Like those used to open cages.

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:13.230
Who's got the keys?
Sweetums has the keys.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.400
Will these keys do
for your comedy magic act?

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:19.503
Ah, they're perfect!
Thank you!
You're welcome.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.705
OK, now everybody
close your eyes

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.407
and put your hands
on the floor.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:31.381
Now, say the magic words,
"owah tafoo lyam," four times.

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:35.719
(all) Owah tafoo lyam.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:39.523
Owah tafoo lyam.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:43.127
Owah tafoo lyam.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.296
Owah tafoo lyam.

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:52.402
He's gone!
He's gone!

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:54.438
That's comedy and magic!
Yeah!

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:01.378
OK, big dramatic ending, babe.
Here it comes.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:03.213
Wait for it.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:07.151
Hey, what are you
doing, Johnny?
Hmm?

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:09.553
Oh, I just got
this jacket cleaned. OK.

01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:14.124
I'll save you!
Lion!

01:08:14.158 --> 01:08:15.825
Whoa!
Oh, gosh.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:19.363
Don't just stand there -
get him!
I am getting him.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.564
In a nice wide shot
with you in the foreground.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:22.566
Oh, good. Nice.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.268
Hi, Mom!

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:26.403
Excuse me,
could I trouble you
to kill someone for me?

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.372
OK. (growls)
Thank you.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.143
(screams)

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:39.783
Whoa!

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:43.587
* Calling all Munchkins,
let's do lunchkins, uh... *

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.156
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,
come on come on.

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:49.259
What took you so long?
(Lion) Oh, ow! Oh!

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:53.162
It's hot.
Let's get this.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.767
That tickled. Take that.
You're ticklish?

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:01.805
The big lug's ticklish!
(laughs and groans)

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.908
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:07.577
All right, Alpha Team,
Crustacean emancipation.

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:11.180
Delta Team, come with me.
Disengage Dorothy.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:13.850
All right, team leaders,
isolate and secure
these silver shoes.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.420
(witch) No!

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:19.288
You know, you're a pest.
Munchkin, actually.

01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:21.390
And you know
what I do to pests?

01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:25.261
Well, you welcome us
as part of an unconventional
multispecies family?

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:28.631
I kill pests!
Until they're dead!

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.367
(choking)

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.773
Check it out.
Your little show's
about to be canceled.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.975
All right, Gale.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.645
This ends now,
once and for all.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.580
Bring it!
Let's go!

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:44.814
It's on!
I'm ready!

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.283
Come with it.
I...

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:49.986
You...

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.689
I'm out.
Let's just fight now.
Hiiii...

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:55.825
Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna
get witch-slapped.
We're outta here, boys.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.627
...iii...

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:00.697
And then, just as Dorothy
and the Wicked Witch

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.632
charge at each other...
Bam!

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.801
Blowout fight scene.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:09.673
The gals whip out
these huge samurai swords,

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.242
and they just tear it up.

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:15.512
I'm talking kung fu!
(whimpers)

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.781
I'm talking walking
on walls!

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:21.418
I'm talking explosions
everywhere!

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.487
(explosions)
(whimpers)

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.756
I'm talking Oz in flames!

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.826
Burn, baby, burn!

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.729
You digging it?
Uh... Yeah...

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:35.332
That sounds a bit violent
for a family film.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:37.534
OK. Cool, cool. OK.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:40.370
We pull back
on the fight scene.

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:44.574
No explosions,
no "burn, baby, burn."

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:45.942
Mm-hmm.

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:48.378
All right, you know,
less kung fu.
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:50.580
But instead, what we have...

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:52.316
Are you ready?
You ready?
Yeah.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:55.051
Morphing.
Morphing?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.721
Morphing.
Crazy morphing!

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.825
We're talking Piggy
transforming into Gonzo.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.961
Mutating into Scooter.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:09.533
Scooter turning into
a big, busty vampire vixen

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:14.871
who explodes
in a sea of crimson blood!

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:17.674
All done in the classic
Japanese anime style,
you know, like, for the kids.

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:20.977
I... yeah.
Sounds... expensive.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:24.314
OK, OK. Uh...
Think, think, think,

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:26.583
think, think, think,
think, think, think, think.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.653
I can work with this -
don't worry. Think, think...

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:32.088
I got it.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:36.526
Dorothy big, bad Dorothy

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.528
goes to kick
the Wicked Witch...

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:39.696
Are you ready?
Yeah.

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:41.798
You ready for this?
Here it comes! Yes, yes!

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:44.701
...in the face!

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:48.538
Oh, now,
that we can afford!
Yes!

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:50.574
Hiiii...

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.381
...ya!

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:03.953
Hii-ya to you, too!

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:08.692
That all you got?
A bottled-water bath?

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.761
What's next?
A deadly pedicure?

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.930
(laughing)

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:17.901
Why am I itching?
What kind of water is this?

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:19.035
Oh. Oh, I...

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.838
We most definitely filled
it up with bottled water.

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:24.040
Ain't that right, Sal?
Oh, yeah. Right, Johnny.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:26.410
100 percent.
Ain't that right,
Angel Marie?

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:29.679
Oh, uh... well, when we
ran out of that stuff,

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:31.581
I topped her off
with a hose.

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:35.385
What? I told you to use
only bottled water!

01:12:35.419 --> 01:12:37.454
Oh, no!
Oopsy.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:40.089
What a horrible way to...
My bad.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:42.826
I'm not melting.
I'm getting skinny!

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:45.028
Oh! I'm getting skinny!

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.564
(singsong) * Ha ha ha ha ha!
I win! I win!

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.634
What?

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.671
Oh, nuts.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.506
No!

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:00.877
(screams)

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:03.747
(snorts)

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.182
(bell)

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:09.553
Uh... should I cut?

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.821
What? What?
Yeah, cut.

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:13.723
Whoa! Hey!

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:17.026
Fabulous performance, darling.
Fabulous! That's incredible!

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.764
What a performance.
Unbelievable, ba... by.

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.468
Oh!

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:27.637
No, sugar patch.
How could it be?

01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:30.674
You were deathly allergic
to tap water!

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.742
Oh.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:34.444
I don't think she can
hear you, Johnny...

01:13:34.478 --> 01:13:35.845
I know she can't hear me!

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:38.114
(sobbing)
(dog barking)

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.517
No, no, baby. Don't look.
D-d-d-don't look.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.686
Don't look.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:45.221
Mama melted.
What?

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.990
(whimpering)

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:48.492
Ugh.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:51.227
We must be strong.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.597
Go to your happy place,
you rotten little dog.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.166
What does she got there?
Got it!

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.569
Her magic eye!
(sobs)

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.808
What happened?

01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:07.711
Oh, the witch is no longer
in the house, OK?

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:09.879
She is down the drain.
We melted her.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.981
(cheering)

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:16.820
Wait, why are you guys
hugging me?

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.822
You're her vile henchmen.

01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:21.791
Vile? No.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:25.762
We were just a gentle band
of motorcycle enthusiasts

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:29.533
until the witch put us
under an evil spell

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:34.504
and enslaved us with her...
her enchanted biker cap.

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:38.942
(all gasp)
Enchanted biker cap!

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.144
Since you wasted her,

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:44.147
this hat rightfully
belongs to you.
Give her the hat.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.184
And now we must obey
any order you give us!

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:51.688
Yeah, like, you can have
everyone spank me

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:53.256
and call me names!

01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:57.927
Or not.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.930
First, we need to pick up
some friends of mine.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:02.932
(all) Yeah!

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.903
OK, here's how we get
out of this place.

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:08.672
Quick, get me
a soldering iron,

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:10.874
a jar of flux
and some corn chips.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:14.811
Oh, no! Flying monkeys!
Roll away, roll away!

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.246
(screams)
(motorcycle engine)

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:24.554
Oh, Dorothy!
Dorothy!

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:26.556
Thank goodness!

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:29.125
Dorothy!

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.194
You guys didn't think
I'd forget you, did you?

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.662
No, but what happened?
Yeah!

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:34.130
It would take too long
to explain.

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:35.899
No, no, no. I
explain, I explain.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.267
What happened was,
the witch, she decided...

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:40.336
Flying monkeys,
put 'em back together.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.972
(Scarecrow) Oh, great.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.141
(metal clanking
and motors whirring)

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.679
(buzzing)
(Scarecrow) Ouch.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:51.948
Hey, easy. OK...

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.117
Thank you.
(Scarecrow)
You're all backwards.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.920
Gee, I can see my rear end.

01:15:56.953 --> 01:16:00.757
I must be working out, huh?
(laughter)

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.126
Flying monkeys, take us
to Emerald City.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:05.629
We have an appointment
with the wizard.
(cheering)

01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:09.866
Come on, everybody!
Come on!

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:13.036
What are you doing here
so... alive?

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.371
With flying monkeys?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:18.241
We're here to see the wizard.
But you don't have
an appointment.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.043
This is our appointment.
(all) Yeah!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.811
No!
Come on, guys.

01:16:21.845 --> 01:16:23.747
No, you can't! No!

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.015
The wizard won't...
No, you can't do that.

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:27.751
(Scarecrow) You can't
stop us now.
Ow!

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:29.619
That's right, that's right!
(Tin Thing) Open the door!

01:16:29.653 --> 01:16:31.921
Come on. Come on, guys.

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:33.890
Follow me.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:36.893
(Dorothy) We got the eye.
We want what you prom... ised.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.195
(murmuring)

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.397
(Lion) This is what
I was afraid of?

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.366
(Scarecrow)
It's not even green.

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.401
What's going on?
Wait, stop.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:48.337
Stop!
You must wear the glasses

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:52.408
or you will fry from
the wizard's brilliance!

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.045
Really? 'Cause...
you're not frying.
Yeah.

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:58.247
(meep)

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:01.184
Oh. Well, uh... um...

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.986
It burns! Oh!

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:08.825
My face sizzles and cooks
before your very eyes!

01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:11.928
Oh, the horror!
The horror!

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.231
(meeping)

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:16.666
Huh?
(meep)

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.367
Oh. (clears throat)

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.904
Um... Well...
(clears throat)

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:24.107
I guess they're not
buying it, Beakie.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.876
So, we must away.
(clears throat)

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:28.277
Toodle-oo.

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:33.049
(wizard) I am Oz,
the great and terrible!

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.685
Jeepers, fellas,
the joint is haunted!

01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:37.754
Yeah! Make like
we're running away!

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:40.890
It's OK! It's all right!
Get back here.

01:17:40.924 --> 01:17:43.359
(wizard) Why do you seek me?

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:46.029
Because we want
what you promised!
Yeah!

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:48.832
(wizard) Oh, dear me.
This is sudden. Uh...

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:51.167
Come back tomorrow

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.871
during normal business hours
8:30am and 5:30pm.

01:17:54.904 --> 01:17:56.940
No way! You've had
enough time already!
Yeah.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.976
Sí. You better keep
your promise or...

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.078
I'll go cyclone in here!

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:06.916
Hey!

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.318
(gibberish)

01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.092
(gibberish)

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:23.166
(gasps for air)

01:18:25.869 --> 01:18:26.970
Ah!

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.779
(on PA) We're done here!

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:38.381
Uh... Yeah...
We can see you.

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:42.118
No, you can't!
I'm invisible!

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.888
Stop. Seriously, you're
embarrassing yourself.

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:03.239
Oh!

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:05.441
Oh, boy.

01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:09.445
Hello.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:12.215
So you're the wonderful
Wizard of Oz?

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.117
I'm a little afraid
of heights. Uh...

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.352
Hi, how are ya?
Good to see ya.
Hi.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:17.954
Well, so, uh...

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:21.858
I'm Francis Kornfine
at your service.
Let me see this!

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:24.493
I'm sorry. It says I'm
from Hollywood, California.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.295
And it says that I drive
a tour bus.

01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:30.199
I gotta tell you,
this is more than
a little disappointing.

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.335
So that's why you wanted
the eye.

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.137
You were afraid
the Wicked Witch

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:36.973
would see you for what
you really are - a big phony!

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.275
No, um... Yes.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:42.145
Something...
Well, something like that.

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.880
You're a bad man.
No.

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.949
I have to disagree.
I'm not a bad man.

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:47.951
I'm... You know...
But I'm a bad wizard.

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:51.520
I gotta tell ya,
I-I never set out
to trick anyone.

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:53.522
It's just, I got here,
and everybody,

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:55.959
they just, they assumed
that I had this thing.

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:59.162
That I was this
all-powerful wizard.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.430
Why would they think that
about you?
You know why?

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.834
Because I-I-I
could do this.
(gasping)

01:20:04.868 --> 01:20:07.236
Oh, my goodness!
Wow!

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:10.439
Oh, do that again!
Do that again!
It's amazing!

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:13.376
They're simple people,
but, oh, they're loving.

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:16.145
Did you ever tell anyone
you weren't a wizard?

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:18.447
No! You know, one of
the secrets of show business

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:21.450
you gotta give them
what they want, you know.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.152
Then give us what we want!

01:20:23.186 --> 01:20:24.587
Yeah, and explain
how you turned into

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.490
such a sexy chicken.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:29.358
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.895
I'm not really a wizard,
but I-I'll do it.

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:34.463
I'll give you
- every one of you -
what I, uh, promised.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:37.566
Give me two hours.
Two hours.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.403
(crowd noises)

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:43.072
(man) She's coming out!
(man #2) Dorothy! Dorothy!

01:20:43.106 --> 01:20:46.642
Dorothy! Over here!
Ooh, ooh,
Dorothy! Dorothy!

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.478
Would you sign
my boomerang fish?
Sure.

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:51.480
He's your biggest fan!

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.283
(chuckles)

01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:57.453
Wow! Thank you!
You're welcome.

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.956
I wish they could see
this back in Kansas!

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:03.159
And here she comes -
Emerald City's Dorothy Gale.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.195
So, Dorothy, how does it feel
to be the biggest star in Oz?

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.597
I don't know!
I'm surprised everyone
likes me so much.

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:11.200
They haven't even
heard me sing!

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:14.437
You heard it, folks.
Dorothy Gale,
the biggest star in Oz.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.139
Even though no one's
ever heard her sing!

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.140
(glass shatters)

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:21.377
Dorothy!
Dorothy! This way!

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.446
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.082
No, listen, Eisner, baby.

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:27.616
If you think we're going
for that deal,

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:30.286
you're out of your
Mickey mind, OK?

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:33.022
I can't talk right now.
I gotta run. I gotta run.
I gotta run!

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:35.091
(* theme music over TV)

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.659
(static)

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:42.265
Ladies and gentleman -
and unisex penguins

01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:44.600
live from Emerald City,

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:46.469
it's the wonderful
Wizard of Oz!

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.671
(cheering and applause)

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.241
(wizard) Ah, thank you.

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:55.011
Oh, this is so exciting!

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:59.482
Oh, thanks. Thank you.
Please. Come on!

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.484
Thank you.
Thank you. Listen...

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:07.323
Um... I-I-I called
you all together
tonight, so...

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:11.995
so the good folks
of Emerald City and Oz
at large can...

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:15.231
finally know the truth. I...

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.532
(sighs)

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:19.602
I am not who I appear to be.
(gasping)

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:22.171
You see, I'm just...

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:25.208
an ordinary guy...
from Hollywood.

01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:28.244
That's a beautiful place
where people keep their word

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.646
and a deal is always honored.

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.715
(all) Nah-uh.

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:35.418
You see, I made a promise
to some brave folks,

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.421
and I want to keep that promise
in front of everyone!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.623
So...

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:43.759
your wizard is gonna
grant some wishes!

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.662
(applause and cheering)
Come on. Come on!

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.998
Oh, I love wizards!
First of all,

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:50.766
let's bring out... the lion.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.635
(cheering)

01:22:58.074 --> 01:22:59.642
(mumbling)

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:03.579
Welcome, Mr. Lion.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:06.015
I-I believe you asked
for some courage.

01:23:06.049 --> 01:23:07.616
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.485
And-And courage
you shall have.

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:12.355
This golden microphone
of bravery

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:15.624
will certainly end
any debate

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:18.427
as to who's really
the king of beasts.

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.263
There you go.
Let me turn this on for you.

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:22.665
Whoa!
Uh-huh.

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:25.334
Wow! I guess I do
feel a little braver.

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:27.303
So, two ducks waddle
into a bar.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.572
Bartender says...

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.474
Get off.
That's not what he says.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.677
No, no, no. Get off.
Oh, that's me. Yeah.

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.445
(* theme music)

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:41.417
And now, ladies
and gentlemen...
Tin Thing.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.786
(* theme music)
(applause)

01:23:47.256 --> 01:23:48.691
Now, Tin Thing,
you asked for a heart,

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:51.227
and thanks
to my clever scientists

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.729
at the Emerald City labs,

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:56.232
your chest...
(gasps)

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:58.434
...will never be empty again.

01:23:58.467 --> 01:23:59.735
This won't hurt.
(beeps)

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.404
(* theme music)
(applause)

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:03.372
Gosh!

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:05.841
This is...
this is so nice!

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:11.414
What if there were someone
to share that heart... with?

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:14.150
(applause)
Camilla!

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:17.420
Oh, my darling!
I've missed you so much!

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:19.555
(all) Aw!

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:21.690
(all) Aw!

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:25.761
Oh, dar--
Look who's filled out!

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.496
(clucking)
I don't mean chubby.

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:29.398
I mean in a nice--
Would you excuse us?

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:31.100
Yes, take it offstage.
Come on.

01:24:31.134 --> 01:24:33.169
(applause)

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:36.339
Let's not forget...
the scarecrow.

01:24:36.372 --> 01:24:39.308
(* theme music)
Oh!

01:24:39.342 --> 01:24:41.610
Hey, guys.
Hey, Scarecrow!

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:44.413
Well, Mr. Scarecrow,
you've asked for nothing
more than a brain.

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.715
Mm-hmm.
Now, from this day forth,

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:48.751
your knowledge
shall know no bounds.

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:49.952
Oh.

01:24:49.985 --> 01:24:53.789
But, um... to grant your wish,
I have to take your head off.

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.424
(gasps)

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:56.725
Uh... Could I...

01:24:56.759 --> 01:24:57.726
could I think about it?

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.895
No. You have no brains.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.430
Oh. Good point.

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:02.865
Bring in the brains.

01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:04.433
(applause)

01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:07.803
(speaks mock Swedish)

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.672
Thank you.
(hums)

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:12.808
All right, quiet, please.
I need absolute...

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:13.876
concentration.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:16.179
Sh, sh!
Quiet! Sh!

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.446
Drum roll, please.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.515
(drum roll)

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:20.649
Uh...

01:25:20.683 --> 01:25:22.585
Huh...

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.857
(all scream)

01:25:30.393 --> 01:25:31.627
What are you...?
What are you...? Oh!

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.128
(giggling)

01:25:35.364 --> 01:25:37.500
(Kermit) This is surreal!

01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:39.602
Or should I say, cereal?

01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:44.173
(cheering)

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:47.210
(applause)

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:49.578
And now you will be
a great man.

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:53.316
For I have given you
a lot of bran new brains!

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.951
(laughter)

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.253
That's funny?

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:58.687
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:25:58.721 --> 01:26:00.489
(whispering)
Oh, right down there,
to the left.

01:26:00.523 --> 01:26:02.591
Left. Thanks!

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:08.264
And finally, it's time
for Oz's newest
overnight sensation to sing.

01:26:08.297 --> 01:26:12.468
My spotlight now belongs
to Miss Dorothy Gale.

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:15.704
(cheering)

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:19.342
* It's a good life

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:21.977
* A happy ending
where you landed

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.414
* It's a good life

01:26:25.448 --> 01:26:27.983
* Don't you love
how it's turning out?

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:32.588
* It's a good life
Oh!

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.657
* See what happens
when you take your chances

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:38.427
* It's a good life

01:26:38.461 --> 01:26:41.597
Stop! Stop the music.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:42.598
(cheering)

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:44.833
(music stops)

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:48.337
I'm sorry,
but this whole thing is a lie.

01:26:48.371 --> 01:26:50.906
It's no different than
those fake green glasses
in Emerald City!

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.308
Or that applause machine.

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:54.910
Oh! Oh, oh...

01:26:54.943 --> 01:27:00.015
You see, this wizard
hasn't given you anything
you didn't already have!

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.652
I've never had such
a shiny microphone before.

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:05.888
The point is,
wizard or no wizard,

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:10.459
you were already brave,
kind and smart.

01:27:10.493 --> 01:27:12.661
Well, gee, I didn't think
I was thinking,

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:15.864
but, come to think of it,
I think I was thinking. Ha.

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:17.433
Makes you think.

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:19.835
(Wizard) OK, I'm...
I'm really upset.

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:23.038
Dorothy, you say
I-I didn't grant your wish.

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.540
But you're on television.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:27.510
Millions hang
on your every word.

01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:30.045
Yes, I control the programming
and nothing else is on,

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.482
but you're famous,
Dorothy. You're a star.

01:27:33.516 --> 01:27:35.951
And that, I gotta say it,
that's, uh...

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.953
that's because of me.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:41.357
You really want to
grant my wish, Wizard?

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:45.661
Send me home, to Kansas,
to my family.

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:48.797
Dorothy,
you consider it done.

01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:50.933
Really? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:54.036
I knew you couldn't be
completely useless.
When do we leave?

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:58.040
Well, um, actually, you have to
visit the fourth witch, Glinda,

01:27:58.073 --> 01:28:00.843
the Good Witch of the, um...

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:02.411
of the South.

01:28:02.445 --> 01:28:04.079
You gotta be kidding me!

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:07.816
Another witch? Great.
How do I find this one?

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.486
Sí, sí. What freaky land
we got to visit now, guy?

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:13.422
Tomorrowland, Adventureland,
Canada.

01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:16.825
The wizard
possesses a magic eye

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:20.062
to, uh... give us all
the, uh, answer.

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:23.866
Dude, I know all about the magic
eye. I gave it to you, remember?

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:26.435
Oh, yes. Ah!
Well, there she is.

01:28:26.469 --> 01:28:27.035
She's in Munchkinland.

01:28:27.069 --> 01:28:29.372
Can you see that?

01:28:29.405 --> 01:28:31.874
She's... she's, uh...

01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:34.643
She's visiting her sister,
Tattypoo.

01:28:34.677 --> 01:28:38.381
the Good Witch
of the, um... North.

01:28:39.682 --> 01:28:42.785
All right, guys.
Back to Munchkinland.

01:28:45.454 --> 01:28:46.655
Oh, well.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:47.923
OK.

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:53.696
You're not so scary.

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:55.498
Hmph!
(* theme music)

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.466
(applause)

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.470
Yeah, this is it.
I definitely...

01:29:01.504 --> 01:29:03.839
This is Munchkinland.
I've seen it in the postcards.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.574
Welcome back, Dorothy.

01:29:05.608 --> 01:29:08.577
I'm glad to see your quest
for fame was such a triumph.

01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:11.814
You're now the most
talked-about diva
in all the land.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:15.951
I saw you on TV.
TV! I saw her on TV!

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:18.887
Yes, I know.
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:20.789
Excuse me, but where can
I find your sister Glinda?

01:29:20.823 --> 01:29:21.790
(muppet) Here's your
cattuccino, Glinda.

01:29:21.824 --> 01:29:23.058
Right here, dear.

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:23.959
Where you goin'?

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:26.128
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.696
Enchanté.

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.832
Oh! Mm.

01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:33.869
And who is this sophisticated
and distinguished gentleman?

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:35.771
Well, my name is Toto.
It's a pleasure...

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:37.806
Not you.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.775
How is it we've never met?

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:42.578
Well, I've spent a lot of time
hanging around on the farm...

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:43.812
literally.

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:45.814
Ah, good one!

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:48.484
Thanks.
Ooh, how intriguing.

01:29:48.517 --> 01:29:50.486
I love agriculture.
Oh?

01:29:50.519 --> 01:29:53.856
Plowing the fields,
rolling in the hay...

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:55.858
Um, guys?
Hate to interrupt,

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:58.894
but the wizard said
you can help me get home.

01:29:58.927 --> 01:30:00.729
It's true.

01:30:00.763 --> 01:30:04.600
Just say goodbye to your friends
and... I will show you the way.

01:30:05.968 --> 01:30:07.202
Well, guys.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:11.173
Guess this is goodbye.
(all) Aw!

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:13.075
(muppet) We're really
gonna miss you, darling.
(squeak)

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:13.909
(muppet #2) Yeah.
What?

01:30:13.942 --> 01:30:16.211
You were the best boss
we ever had.

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:19.715
I think it's time for you
to be your own boss.

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:23.151
Oh, I don't believe
you're gonna do it!

01:30:26.555 --> 01:30:29.458
(all cheer)

01:30:29.492 --> 01:30:31.560
I'm sorry,
I'm not following.

01:30:31.594 --> 01:30:32.728
The monkey gets the hat?

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.196
The monkey gets the hat?

01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:35.498
The monkey gets the hat.

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.067
Huh.

01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:42.505
Looks like this is finally it.

01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:47.843
We must be brave,
Dorothy.

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:49.612
Oh, oh!

01:30:49.645 --> 01:30:53.081
(sobs)

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:57.486
Goodbyes always
break my heart. (sobs)

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.487
Aw.

01:30:58.521 --> 01:31:00.823
I love you guys.

01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:02.558
I'll never forget you.

01:31:02.591 --> 01:31:03.726
Oh.

01:31:05.561 --> 01:31:07.462
I'll never
forget you, either.

01:31:13.869 --> 01:31:15.604
Toto, you sure...

01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:19.207
No! Don't speak,
my little Dorothita.

01:31:20.643 --> 01:31:22.511
Just go!

01:31:22.545 --> 01:31:25.247
Don't look back, OK?

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.618
Because if you do,
I fear my tears would...

01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:31.554
So how do these things
work, anyway?

01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:33.889
Is there a bus
or something?

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:37.526
No, it's your shoes. They have
the power to take you anywhere.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.861
Really? Anywhere?

01:31:38.894 --> 01:31:41.897
Well, I wish someone
would have told me this

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:46.101
before these magic shoes
gave me these magic blisters.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:51.039
What? Look, this is how things
work in enchanted lands.

01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:53.776
The thing you were looking for
was there all along! Jeez!

01:31:53.809 --> 01:31:55.010
Do you wanna get home or not?

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:57.980
Thanks, sis.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:01.784
All you have to do is knock
your heels together three times,

01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:05.788
and command the shoes to take
you wherever you wish to go.

01:32:05.821 --> 01:32:07.823
(sighs)

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.291
I hope this works.

01:32:11.594 --> 01:32:13.829
(muppets) One, two, three!

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:17.265
Take me home to Aunt Em!

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:24.039
Bye, Dorothy!

01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:27.309
Yeah. We'll miss you.

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:05.013
Hey, need any help
with the early-bird rush?

01:33:05.047 --> 01:33:06.314
Dorothy!

01:33:06.348 --> 01:33:08.250
You're alive!

01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:12.187
Look at you! Man,
when that twister hit

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:12.921
and flew off with the house,

01:33:12.955 --> 01:33:15.824
well, we thought
that you were...

01:33:15.858 --> 01:33:19.261
Well, where on earth
have you been, Dorothy?

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:20.763
And what are you wearing?

01:33:20.796 --> 01:33:22.665
What's wrong
with my clothes now?

01:33:22.698 --> 01:33:25.100
Guess which refrigerator broke
down when you were gone? The...

01:33:25.133 --> 01:33:27.069
Don't worry, Uncle Henry.
I don't want to fight.

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:30.138
I just want to say...
you were right.

01:33:30.172 --> 01:33:35.911
Wanting to be a big star
made me forget what
I really love about singing.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.380
When you're doing it right,
I mean really singing,

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:40.749
you don't notice
where you are anyway.

01:33:40.783 --> 01:33:44.319
I don't think
I'm leaving Kansas for a while!

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.121
Well, somebody's gonna
be sorry to hear that.

01:33:46.154 --> 01:33:47.990
He's been in here every day
asking about you.

01:33:48.023 --> 01:33:50.358
And eatin' up
all the flowers.
Mm-hmm.

01:33:50.392 --> 01:33:51.259
Mr. Kermit?

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:54.963
Oh, Miss Gale!

01:33:54.997 --> 01:33:56.965
Oh, I'm so glad
that you're all right!

01:33:56.999 --> 01:33:58.366
Hey, we listened to your demo,

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.736
and you're the best singer
that we heard anywhere!

01:34:00.769 --> 01:34:02.871
We're hoping
you'll join our tour!

01:34:02.905 --> 01:34:06.041
Oh, wow!
I can't believe it!

01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:08.443
But... I can't leave now.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:11.814
I just got home
with my family.

01:34:11.847 --> 01:34:12.948
Oh.

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.684
Well, OK. Uh...

01:34:15.718 --> 01:34:17.953
Thank you
for your time. Um...

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.923
I mean, there was that
one other girl in Nebraska

01:34:20.956 --> 01:34:21.957
who was all right...

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:23.992
Kermit, w-wait.
Don't leave yet.

01:34:24.026 --> 01:34:26.294
OK.

01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:29.965
Dorothy, when that wind picked
up our house and blew it away,

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:33.435
it gave me a whole new
perspective on what home
is really about.

01:34:33.468 --> 01:34:37.372
If you want to go on tour
and sing, I want you to go.

01:34:37.405 --> 01:34:39.875
because now I know
you'll always be home with us,

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:41.276
no matter
where you are.

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:45.080
You mean it?
Come on.

01:34:45.113 --> 01:34:46.782
Wanna get some, Kermit?
We're family now.

01:34:46.815 --> 01:34:49.084
Ah.

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:50.352
You guys are great.

01:34:50.385 --> 01:34:52.855
Well, Kermit.
Yeah?

01:34:52.888 --> 01:34:53.822
Guess I'm going with you!

01:34:53.856 --> 01:34:55.157
Great!

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:57.359
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Dorothy Gale!

01:34:57.392 --> 01:34:59.862
(applause and cheering)

01:34:59.895 --> 01:35:02.931
* Ah-ha, whoa

01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:05.968
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:08.771
* I got a feeling
that we did something right

01:35:08.804 --> 01:35:10.973
* Everything looking up,
future shining bright

01:35:11.006 --> 01:35:13.341
* I gotta get the message out,
send it loud and clear

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:15.778
* All you need is right here

01:35:15.811 --> 01:35:18.146
* Who said happiness
is so far away?

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.849
* Closer than you might think,
find it every day

01:35:20.883 --> 01:35:25.287
* Step back, you'll see
you're part of a family

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.856
* It's a good life

01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:29.925
* A happy ending
is where you landed

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:32.394
* It's a good life

01:35:32.427 --> 01:35:34.429
* Don't you love
how it's turning out?

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:37.265
* It's a good life

01:35:37.299 --> 01:35:39.768
* See what happens
when you take your chances?

01:35:39.802 --> 01:35:41.469
* It's a good life

01:35:41.503 --> 01:35:45.107
* Come on
and find what I've found

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.474
(Animal) Good life! Good life!

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:48.343
Oh, that's my niece!

01:35:48.376 --> 01:35:50.145
It's my niece.
That's my niece!

01:35:50.178 --> 01:35:51.513
* Yeah

01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:53.816
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Dorothy Gale!

01:35:53.849 --> 01:35:54.883
(applause and cheering)

01:35:54.917 --> 01:35:58.453
Yay! Yay!
