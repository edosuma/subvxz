You want to know if God speaks to me?

- Yes.
- He does.

00:08.457 --> 00:11.359
- DAVID: What is it?
- KORECKI: Prophecies. The Poveglia Codex.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.807
Some of the prophecies have
been echoed word-for-word

00:14.808 --> 00:16.164
<i>by your prophet.</i>

quiet, it helps me hear him.

what Grace was drawing.</i>

- Yeah, they're diaries. Look,

_

02:38.674 --> 02:40.842
Her name was Grace Ling.

02:40.843 --> 02:43.611
She ran a day care center in Flushing.

02:43.612 --> 02:45.680
We were sent by the Church to decide

02:45.681 --> 02:48.042
- whether she had prophetic abilities.
- KRISTEN: <i>We observed her</i>

02:48.043 --> 02:49.550
warn a woman to get out of her house

02:49.551 --> 02:51.719
before it "fell into darkness".

02:51.720 --> 02:53.121
And the next day,

02:53.122 --> 02:55.790
the house collapsed into a sinkhole.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.866
She would sometimes blow up a balloon

02:57.867 --> 02:59.827
to hear God more accurately.

03:00.863 --> 03:02.630
Excuse me?

03:02.631 --> 03:05.633
She would blow up a toy balloon.

03:05.634 --> 03:07.902
Do you not find this odd,

03:07.903 --> 03:09.804
a prophet requiring

03:09.805 --> 03:11.639
the blowing up of a balloon?

03:11.640 --> 03:14.242
I found it odd that there
was a prophet at all.

03:14.243 --> 03:16.354
Everything after that was just gravy.

03:16.355 --> 03:18.946
What does that mean... "gravy"?

03:18.947 --> 03:20.948
It means that once something is stupid,

03:20.949 --> 03:24.385
it doesn't matter how much more
stupid gets piled on top of it.

03:25.821 --> 03:28.623
Then how do you explain this?

03:29.658 --> 03:32.226
I'm sorry, who are you guys again?

03:32.227 --> 03:34.896
We are assessors here
at the Pope's discretion

03:34.897 --> 03:37.732

was a false prophet

03:37.733 --> 03:39.467
or a true one.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.260
Do you have an opinion?

03:41.261 --> 03:42.270
I do.

03:42.271 --> 03:45.273
I think you should get
China to return her.

03:45.274 --> 03:47.275
SILVIO: You understand,

03:47.276 --> 03:49.277
her prophecies, if true,

03:49.278 --> 03:51.579
are worrisome, Mr. Acosta.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.614
- I do.
- They prophesy

03:53.615 --> 03:55.917
a great devastation. Fires everywhere.

03:55.918 --> 03:57.251
As does the Book of Revelation.

03:57.252 --> 03:59.253
SILVIO: Given that, do you think

03:59.254 --> 04:02.423
she is a false prophet or a true one?

04:02.424 --> 04:04.258
I think Grace was a wonderful person

04:04.259 --> 04:06.094
with, um, great intuitive sense,

04:06.095 --> 04:08.496
but I don't believe anyone
can foretell the future.

04:08.497 --> 04:10.698

was any kind of prophet.

Is that your name, demon?

No. A boy I slaughtered.

I slashed his throat.

Enrique. Enrique.

His unbaptized soul
went straight to hell.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.381
This is not real.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.217
I called his parents.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.052
I wanted them to know

05:45.053 --> 05:47.254
their child went to hell.

05:47.255 --> 05:50.924
But I couldn't stop
laughing long enough.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.297

05:59.934 --> 06:01.702
That's the Bridget Ferrell exorcism.

06:01.703 --> 06:03.904
Yes, in its second day.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.406
Bridget had a miscarriage

06:06.407 --> 06:09.309
and started having seizures
and talking in other voices.

06:09.310 --> 06:12.813
- Dissociative personalities?
- We didn't know.

06:12.814 --> 06:15.215
But she started speaking
in Latin and Aramaic,

06:15.216 --> 06:16.950
so we recommended an exorcism.

06:16.951 --> 06:19.820
Unfortunately, what I heard there

06:19.821 --> 06:21.323
was a confession to murder.

06:21.324 --> 06:23.624
Do we know if there even was a murder?

06:24.659 --> 06:25.890
No.

06:25.891 --> 06:27.961
Well, if there was, the
court does not acknowledge

06:27.962 --> 06:29.748
demonic possession,
and that woman's guilty.

06:29.749 --> 06:32.223
- Unfortunately, yes.
- I don't know how unfortunate that is.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.577
- I mean, if she killed...
- This woman is possessed,

06:34.578 --> 06:36.670
and the demon used her body to kill.

06:36.671 --> 06:39.482
Bridget is innocent.
The demon is guilty.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.308
- Well, wh...
- What do you want us to do, Monsignor?

06:44.078 --> 06:46.146
Find out if there was a murder

06:46.147 --> 06:49.283

Kristen knows the law on this matter.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.934
That's not the problem.

07:06.935 --> 07:09.369
Does ICE have any news on
this prophet's whereabouts?

07:09.370 --> 07:10.971
- Grace?
- Yes.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.507
No. No.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.876
They sent her back to China.

07:15.877 --> 07:18.879
I'm a little worried they
put her in a reeducation camp.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.714
The Vatican's worried about that, too.

07:20.715 --> 07:23.717
That's why they sent
their three top men.

07:23.718 --> 07:25.399
Those are their three top men?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.453
Yes. Why?

07:26.454 --> 07:29.122
They seem more worried
about Ben being a Muslim

07:29.123 --> 07:30.969
and Kristen being a lapsed Catholic.

07:30.970 --> 07:32.884
Okay, just answer their questions.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.299
They apologize to Kristen
and Ben, then we'll talk.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.560
Don't be a child.

07:36.561 --> 07:38.031
The Vatican doesn't apologize.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.700
This is about stopping a massacre.

07:39.701 --> 07:41.368
Then they should stop asking my team

07:41.369 --> 07:43.170
about their sex lives.

He never left her alone
in the room with us.

36:43.528 --> 36:45.441
Mira said she received
an anonymous call

36:45.442 --> 36:46.466
claiming to have evidence

36:46.467 --> 36:47.932
that Bridget did it.

36:47.933 --> 36:50.301
I think Bridget is innocent.

36:50.302 --> 36:52.103
I think so, too.

36:52.104 --> 36:53.705
- I think the husband did it.
- Me too.

36:53.706 --> 36:55.907
Okay, guys, I want to agree with you...

36:55.908 --> 36:59.110
but she knew where
those kids were buried.

37:01.113 --> 37:02.835
Well, there is a psychological condition

37:02.836 --> 37:04.749
called coercive control.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.285
A criminal husband
can dominate his spouse

37:07.286 --> 37:09.251
and force her to hide his crimes.

37:09.252 --> 37:11.741
And sometimes, the dominated spouse

37:11.742 --> 37:13.391
will even take the blame for the crimes.

37:13.392 --> 37:14.859
Why does psychology always sound like

37:14.860 --> 37:17.426
a con to me? It does.

37:17.427 --> 37:19.330
It's like religion for grad students.

37:19.331 --> 37:21.919
So you think the husband is
framing her for the murders?

37:21.920 --> 37:24.716
I think both Bridget and
Dwight had access to the car,

37:24.717 --> 37:27.472
and he would have had the
evidence to plant on her.

37:28.841 --> 37:30.275
So what do we do?

37:30.276 --> 37:33.872
I think it's time that
I offer him some...

37:33.873 --> 37:36.281
spiritual counseling.

37:57.269 --> 37:59.270

38:11.617 --> 38:13.618

(WOOD CREAKS)

38:42.548 --> 38:44.549
(CRACK)

38:58.097 --> 38:59.430
Hey, David.

39:03.081 --> 39:04.549
What's going on, Dwight?

39:06.705 --> 39:09.019
These were souvenirs
that Bridget collected

39:09.020 --> 39:10.420
from the crime scenes.

39:11.844 --> 39:13.278
I was j...

39:15.413 --> 39:16.670
I'm a good husband.

39:16.671 --> 39:18.723
I was just trying to keep
them from the police...

39:18.724 --> 39:20.007
I-I...

39:21.309 --> 39:22.710
(CRYING)

39:26.815 --> 39:29.617

39:29.618 --> 39:30.851

39:36.458 --> 39:38.459
(GROANS)

40:04.986 --> 40:06.987
♪♪

40:26.070 --> 40:27.437
There.

40:30.245 --> 40:31.745
Where'd you see that?

40:31.746 --> 40:34.081
Dwight's hiding place.

40:34.082 --> 40:37.051
Where he hid the murder
weapons and the souvenirs.

40:37.052 --> 40:38.452
They arrested him?

40:38.453 --> 40:40.654
Yes. And released Bridget.

40:40.655 --> 40:41.755
Good.

40:43.258 --> 40:45.793
So these are, like, demon symbols?

40:45.794 --> 40:48.622
Yep. And this is Leland.

40:48.623 --> 40:51.396
Oh, my God, you haven't gone
over to his side, have you?

40:51.397 --> 40:53.541
No, I'm just following the psychopaths.

40:53.542 --> 40:56.770
Psychopaths seem to like
their demonology.

41:04.465 --> 41:05.913
What, you recognize another?

41:32.048 --> 41:34.316
Yeah, it's the same.

41:42.817 --> 41:44.618
BEN: Okay,

41:44.619 --> 41:46.320
so this guy's influenced by symbols.

41:46.321 --> 41:48.155
What does that mean?

41:51.671 --> 41:53.327
So what are you thinking...

41:53.328 --> 41:55.596
this artist is one of
Leland's psychopaths?

41:55.597 --> 41:56.797
I don't know.

41:56.798 --> 41:58.265
Who's the artist?

42:02.237 --> 42:03.737
My father.

42:10.414 --> 42:14.155
