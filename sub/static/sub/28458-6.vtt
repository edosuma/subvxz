00:01.334 --> 00:04.462
Previously on "The amazing
Race," eight teams raced to

00:04.546 --> 00:06.756
Dubai in the united arab
Emirates.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.968
The reilly sisters off to a
Shaky start.

00:10.051 --> 00:13.263
Do you not know how to get
There?

00:13.346 --> 00:19.477
The detour caused
Prehistoric mayhem and virtual.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.061
Frustration.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.312
Sorry, did not pass.

00:21.396 --> 00:25.233
This is taking us too long.

00:25.316 --> 00:29.237
At the road block, bret
Couldn't find the beat.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.281
Team fun soared to a win.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.284
My god!

00:34.367 --> 00:36.286
While rachel and elissa Crashed.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.829
I love "The amazing race."

00:37.912 --> 00:40.832
It touches your heart.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.250
But managed to hang on.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.962
This is a non-elimination leg.

00:46.045 --> 00:46.629
Eight teams remain.

00:46.713 --> 00:53.970
Who will be eliminated, next.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.605
Bye, dubai.

01:04.688 --> 01:08.318
Fly to the pearl of africa,
Uganda.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.820
Becca and floyd will be
The first to leave dubai, known.

01:10.904 --> 01:15.825
As the city of gold, and travel
2,000 miles to uganda, the pearl.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.076
Of africa.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.705
After touching down, teams must
Hail a taxi and make their way.

01:20.789 --> 01:28.789
Into the capital city of...
Where more than four million.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.300
People commute every day.

01:32.383 --> 01:36.179
They'll find their clue at the
Uganda mosque.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.390
All the teams came in within
Minutes behind us so we can't.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.391
Make any wrong decisions.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.643
How are you?

01:41.726 --> 01:46.898
Having former "Amazing race"
Teams and "Survivor" and "Big.

01:46.981 --> 01:52.028
"Brother" teams, these people
Have competition experience.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.738
Under heavy stress like we have.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.823
Let's go, baby.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.342
The last two legs, we have
Been doing very well.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.244
We're definitely on people's
Radar now where we probably.

01:59.327 --> 01:59.953
Weren't before.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.831
The challenge today is to.

02:02.914 --> 02:08.169
Appreciate a culture that
Doesn't quite appreciate us back.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.378
As openly gay men.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.423
It was definitely emotional
To open the clue and see we were.

02:12.507 --> 02:18.221
Going to uganda because we both
Know that so many people who.

02:18.304 --> 02:26.229
Identify as lgbtq-plus can't
Live their lives as openly as we.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.023
Do back home.

02:29.107 --> 02:29.440
Good morning.

02:29.524 --> 02:29.983
Good morning.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.401
Long time, no see.

02:31.484 --> 02:37.115
I kind of broke down a little
Bit at the airport realizing the.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.410
Privileges that we're allotted,
Being able to live as openly as.

02:40.493 --> 02:45.039
We do and to recognize that not
Everybody is allotted those same.

02:45.123 --> 02:45.415
Privileges.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.960
It's crazy.

02:49.043 --> 02:53.423
Love you, brother.

02:53.506 --> 02:58.136
Let's kick ass in uganda.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.053
That's our plan.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.221
Uganda!

03:00.305 --> 03:01.723
We're feeling really good.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.059
We're feeling pretty Fantastic.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.537
We beat two previous "Amazing
Race" teams.

03:06.561 --> 03:12.108
We both have three kids, all
Under the age of 6.

03:12.191 --> 03:16.529
Having sacrificed this time from
Our families, gives us extra.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.465
Motivation because we want to
Make it worthwhile.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.658
There's the reilly sisters.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.784
Hey, guys!

03:21.868 --> 03:22.577
My god!

03:22.660 --> 03:23.786
So good to see you.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.498
It was a really great thing
Working with the reilly sisters.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.560
We love hanging out with them,
Laughing with them, sharing.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.627
Stories.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.630
We're just moms hanging out
Doing "The amazing race."

03:33.713 --> 03:35.632
the mom squad is here to Stay.

03:35.715 --> 03:41.512
Mom squad.

03:41.596 --> 03:46.142
We caught back up with the
Other teams.

03:46.225 --> 03:46.809
It's amazing.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.173
We're all on the same flight.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.980
We're going to make up our speed
Bump, make up our time.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.316
Going to uganda, the mosque.

03:53.399 --> 03:57.695
Eighth place, sixth place,
Seventh place.

03:57.779 --> 04:03.868
In vegas, eight, six and seven
Equals 21 so this leg we're.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.744
Coming in number one.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.372
It's about time we get a
First place.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.291
Uganda be kidding me.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.169
There are teams like nic and
Vic that are solid.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.672
Chris and bret are really longer
Fast.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.005
We're in leg six.

An "Amazing race" team.

National mosque.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.478
We're feeling good.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.441
We got the fastest driver in the
Whole bunch.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.066
Here they come.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.610
Nice, thank you, buddy.

05:19.694 --> 05:27.694
Hoping to see some lions, some
Tigers, some elephants and some.

05:32.165 --> 05:32.749
Avganimals.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.625
We just let them walk around?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.420
We're going to have so much
Fun in uganda.

05:37.503 --> 05:45.094
We were going into this leg
Feeling overwhelmed and for.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.739
Queer people like us to come
Here and feel triumphant would.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.475
Be great so our goal today is to
Get a first place win and it's.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.601
Going to be a good day.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.978
Is that the mosque up there?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.772
This is it.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.898
Time to change.

05:56.981 --> 05:57.440
Let's go.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.816
Where do we change?

05:58.900 --> 06:02.820
We dressed in the respectful
Wardrobe we were supposed to.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.362
Have.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.781
Which way do we go?

06:04.864 --> 06:05.114
I don't know.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.449
Hello.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.576
Do we get dressed in here?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.286
I'm coming.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.621
Look for a box.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.789
Right here.

06:12.872 --> 06:13.456
Ready to see.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.583
Come on, bret.

06:15.666 --> 06:23.666
Count the number of steps in
The minnerette.

06:26.052 --> 06:31.015
After climbing 272 steps,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.684
Which they have to count, they
Will see kampala from the.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.645
Highest vantage point in time.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.646
Count the number of steps.

06:36.729 --> 06:42.777
In your head, please.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.653
We're the only ones here.

06:43.736 --> 06:47.782
I don't care.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.201
Count the number of steps.

06:50.284 --> 06:54.455
We had done research about
This mosque and we read that.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.624
There were 304 stairs so we
Didn't even count.

06:56.707 --> 07:01.254
Keep going, just keep going.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.215
We're here.

07:04.298 --> 07:04.632
Hustle.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.842
I'm coming.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.425
Amazing.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.844
That's a great view.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.680
Look at that.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.640
The right answer, you count
The stairs.

07:12.723 --> 07:16.144
We got to go count the Stairs.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.520
We have to find a clue.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.646
Go.

07:18.729 --> 07:23.192
Come on, bret, we got to get
Up there, we're first.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.487
If you had slowed down
Instead of screaming us up those.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.697
Stairs.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.091
He was gasping so badly, I
Couldn't understand what he was.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.325
Saying.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.409
Right here.

07:32.451 --> 07:40.451
Count the number of steps in
The minnerette.

07:40.835 --> 07:45.214
It's totally ho chi minh city

07:45.298 --> 07:45.756
2.0.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.258
What is this?

07:47.341 --> 07:50.219
We're in front of traffic.

07:50.303 --> 07:58.303
Here we go.

07:59.687 --> 08:07.361
Do we got it?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.529
You're kidding.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.632
The number we looked up
Online was not the right number.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.117
We had to count a certain
Amount of stairs that were.

08:13.201 --> 08:13.993
Marked.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.596
Not the full amount of the
Entire mosque.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.287
We can do this.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.874
My god.

08:19.957 --> 08:26.714
Hi.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.089
Thank you.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.302
God bless.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.388
We're going to go down first.

08:34.472 --> 08:40.770
Count the number of steps in
The minaret.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.147
Hi, thank you.

08:43.231 --> 08:49.946
272.

08:50.029 --> 08:50.947
Kampala!

08:51.030 --> 08:52.740
Here we come.

08:52.823 --> 08:56.244
Count the steps between Marks.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.453
Come on, rach.

08:57.536 --> 08:58.829
Come on, read the clue.

08:58.913 --> 09:05.086
Travel by taxi to a market
And the main gate, search the.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.964
Restaurant area for your next
Clue.

09:08.047 --> 09:16.047
Owino market.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.516
This is crazy.

09:18.599 --> 09:18.766
I don't see any flow of traffic
The direction we're going at.

09:18.849 --> 09:22.853
All.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.274
Add into the mix mopeds,
Pedestrians.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.984
I'm scared.

09:28.067 --> 09:32.822
We're back.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.284
Thank you, thank you.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.328
Good job.

09:39.412 --> 09:39.912
272.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.832
Is that right?

09:42.915 --> 09:48.170
"Amazing race!"
travel by taxi to owino.

09:48.254 --> 09:48.546
Market.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.172
Let's do it.

09:50.256 --> 09:50.881
Let's go.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.967
Come on, leo.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.012
Got to change, colin.

09:56.095 --> 09:56.887
Two teams behind us.

09:56.971 --> 09:57.847
Be positive.

09:57.930 --> 10:02.560
If you are correct, he will hand
You a clue.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.396
How many steps?

10:05.479 --> 10:07.648
We're here.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
Rach... >> I'm hurrying.

10:09.525 --> 10:13.029
234.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.573
Start over.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.908
Elissa was running so fast.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.203
How am I supposed to jet up this
Thing and count in my head at.

10:21.287 --> 10:21.871
The same time.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.539
You said you were counting.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.709
I can't be perfect, elissa.

10:26.792 --> 10:34.091
Travel by taxi to owino
Market, the main gate.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.761
We need to go slow counting Up.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.928
No duh.

10:38.012 --> 10:43.768
Get your game face back on,
Rachel.

10:43.851 --> 10:47.188
Thank you, buddy.

10:47.271 --> 10:47.646

10:47.730 --> 10:48.439
Thank you, buddy.

10:48.522 --> 10:52.526
Thank you, thank you so much
Cool.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.530
Let's go.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.740
Go fast, go.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.992
We got it.

11:00.076 --> 11:00.910
Right?

11:00.993 --> 11:05.373
You need to count... go back
And count.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.582
What?

11:06.665 --> 11:07.583
Take your time.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.795
My god.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.090
Why is every team so much better
Than us?

11:14.173 --> 11:17.259
Stop, stop, stop.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.388
This is us, we're second to
The last.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.057
Janelle and britney are the only
Team behind us right now.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.101
This is the craziest thing
I've ever seen.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.770
My god.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.606
This bus is like, it's going to
Hit us.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.733
This is horrible.

11:41.158 --> 11:47.164
Traveling literally down the.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.959
Middle of oncoming traffic.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.795
He just got out of his car.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.798
Clue box.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.300
Count the number of steps in
The minaret.

11:58.384 --> 12:06.384
Here we go.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.647
71, 72.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.273
271.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.858
No, it's 270, I think.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.817
In between the marks.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.985
Ok.

12:16.068 --> 12:20.489
Are you sure?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.866
Honestly, 272?

12:21.949 --> 12:29.665
Yeah.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.041

12:31.125 --> 12:31.459
Yeah.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.835

12:35.087 --> 12:38.340

12:38.424 --> 12:39.008
Praise god.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.885
272.

12:40.968 --> 12:41.218
272.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.970
Got it.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.805
Yay!

12:44.889 --> 12:46.765
Good work, good work.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.850
Tourism office.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.684
Right here.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.978
Are we the last?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.689
Please hurry, ma'am.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.483
Ok.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.400
Owino market, let's go.

12:56.484 --> 13:04.484
Count of number of steps in
The minaret.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.830
We got to go through the main
Gate at owino market.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.914
Owino market.

13:10.956 --> 13:11.707
This is the gate?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.083
This market's crazy!

13:13.167 --> 13:16.253
840-some people live in my Town.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.148
There were thousands of
People in that market.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.924
That's so crazy.

13:20.007 --> 13:24.345
Just keep going straight.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.057
Owino restaurant, that way?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.726
This is bonkers.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.020
I feel a lot of teams could get
Lost in here.

13:33.103 --> 13:37.399
Soweto restaurant.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.068
Tyler, soweto restaurant?

13:39.151 --> 13:39.902
They say it's here somewhere.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.947
This way, that way, this way.

13:43.030 --> 13:49.745
Man.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.996
I see it right there.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.705
A speed bump.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.915
Road block.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.918
Owino market covers an area
About the size of 20 football.

13:56.001 --> 14:00.089
Fields and is visited by more
Than 300,000 customers every.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.257
Day.

14:01.340 --> 14:08.931
The most popular street food
Here is the rolex sandwich, a.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.225
Chabaty filled with a mixture of
Vegetables and eggs.

14:11.308 --> 14:16.188
After shopping for the
Ingredients, teams must make one.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.941
Rolex to get their next clue.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.485
You want me to do it?

14:21.569 --> 14:29.569
The only thing I know about
Roles are the watches.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.162
Who wants a rolex?

14:32.246 --> 14:35.958
Ask the vendor, list of
Ingredients?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.167
Thank you.

14:37.251 --> 14:41.255
Six tomatoes, four small red
Onions, one bag of cabbage.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.591
Four small red onions?

14:43.674 --> 14:44.258
How much?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.094
Where can I find tomatoes?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.304
Is this tomatoes?

14:48.387 --> 14:52.099
I need four carrots.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.101
Who wants a rolex, I do?

14:54.184 --> 14:57.271
How you doing, buddy,
Ingredients?

14:57.354 --> 14:57.688
Thank you.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.606
Please hurry.

14:58.689 --> 15:06.280
Do you not think I'm trying
My hardest?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.823
We can still catch up.

15:07.906 --> 15:08.073
Go.

15:08.157 --> 15:08.616
Go.

15:08.699 --> 15:08.824
Go.

15:08.907 --> 15:09.575
Go.

15:09.658 --> 15:17.658
Go.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.171
It looks like a food dish.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.174
I thought it was a watch.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.469
Onion, chop up an egg.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.178
Beautiful.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.304
Demonstration.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.724
Rolled eggs, rolex.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.892
That went over my head.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.186
Which station can I cook?

15:37.269 --> 15:37.728
Can I cook here?

15:37.811 --> 15:38.270
Right here, I see it.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.148
Who wants a rolex?

15:41.231 --> 15:41.690
I got it.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.859
There's the clue box.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.486
Who wants a rolex?

15:45.569 --> 15:46.737
Your boy wants a rolex.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.407
I'm basically trying to shred
All these vegetables except the.

15:50.491 --> 15:50.783
Tomatoes.

15:50.866 --> 15:54.203
Ok, hot.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.705
Trying to get it round.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.292
Seemed like it was pretty Big.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.503
It doesn't grow when you cook
It?

16:02.586 --> 16:03.003
Maybe.

16:03.087 --> 16:03.545
So far, so good.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.173
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.258
Which station?

16:08.342 --> 16:11.011
This one?

16:11.095 --> 16:11.595
Don't you burn it, victor.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.681
I'm trying not to, bud.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.848
Pretty?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.101
Everything's shredded except
For the tomato.

16:17.184 --> 16:21.230
It's looking good.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.775
Rach, we have to go across
The street.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.693
My gosh.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.360
Come on, rach.

16:26.443 --> 16:31.115
We got to keep our eyes open.

16:31.198 --> 16:31.532
Wait.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.491
My god.

16:32.574 --> 16:37.579
We need to find the soweto
Restaurant area.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.375
Look at that, that's just
Pretty.

16:41.458 --> 16:45.504
Probably the hardest part to
Cook is the bread.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.213
Definitely not.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.924
Let's make an omelette.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.592
Did you put the eggs on?

16:50.676 --> 16:51.385
I did.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.304
The flip is the hard part.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.098
That's pretty.

16:56.181 --> 16:56.765
I'm about to try this.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.892
I think I'm still in first.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.728
I'm trying not to look at
Anybody else.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.687
It's ok.

17:01.770 --> 17:07.108
Leo is definitely the cook in
The household.

17:07.192 --> 17:07.776
I'm sorry.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.655
Watch what you're doing!

17:11.739 --> 17:16.285
Hey, whoa, whoa.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.454
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

17:18.537 --> 17:20.998
Good, good, good, good.

17:21.080 --> 17:25.294
Yeah, nicole, nicole, we got it!

17:25.377 --> 17:31.341
Go by taxi to gaba landing site.

17:31.425 --> 17:36.972
Teams must make their way
To the gaba landing site and.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.308
Find the village elders to
Receive their next clue.

17:39.391 --> 17:46.148
Thank you very much!

17:46.231 --> 17:48.609
Here we go.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.027
Thought I killed that.

17:50.110 --> 17:50.861
Rolex.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.112
Thank you very much!

17:52.196 --> 17:53.214
Right here, right here.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.823
Who wants a rolex?

17:54.907 --> 17:55.991
Do you it.

17:56.074 --> 17:56.492
Don't you think so?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.285
Sure, I'll do it.

17:58.368 --> 18:02.664
Vendor, vendor.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.665
Rolex.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.335
Where can I get a watch?

18:06.418 --> 18:09.004
I need a rolex watch?

18:09.087 --> 18:10.005
A rolex?

18:10.088 --> 18:10.464
No.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.799
Excuse me, please.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.341
Excuse me.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.384
My god, this sucks.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.428
My god, there's team fun.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.180
Rach, go.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.557
Speed bump!

18:20.641 --> 18:23.644
Having arrived last in the
Previous leg, rachel and elissa.

18:23.727 --> 18:28.023
Must complete a speed bump,
Doing laundry in kampala's.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.192
Busiest and most chaotic market.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.363
Hand washing these dirty clothes
Will take a while but then.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.324
Trying to find a place to hang
Them out in this crowded spot,

18:37.407 --> 18:40.494
Good luck to them.

18:40.577 --> 18:45.374
A local laundry lady will
Lead you to the washing station.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.333
Thank you.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.377
We have to do a speed bump and
Wash clothes.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.294
We're used to that.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.297
We've got lots of kids.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.048
Where's our laundry?

18:53.131 --> 18:58.679
Soap, scrub, wash again, Rinse.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.764
Wring, and hang it up.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.390
Cool.

19:01.473 --> 19:01.890
This is a lot of laundry.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.767
It's ok, rach.

19:03.851 --> 19:04.726
We got this.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.519
That's a lot of work.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.730
Thank god for washing Machines.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.901
Washing laundry in uganda is
No joke.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.069
Are you a vendor?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.612
Looking good, girl.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.029
Thanks.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.197
My god.

19:17.281 --> 19:22.578
Rolex, where can I find a Rolex?

19:22.661 --> 19:24.872
Rolex?

19:24.955 --> 19:25.414
Rolex.

19:25.497 --> 19:30.335
Who wants rolex?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
No good?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.298
I got a big audience here.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.300
There is goes.

19:36.383 --> 19:43.098
Yes, yes, yes.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.391
Yes, yes, yes!

19:44.474 --> 19:45.100
Clue!

19:45.183 --> 19:46.476
Give me a clue!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.770
Thank you, sir, thank you, sir.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.187
Yeah!

19:49.271 --> 19:49.897
You got it?

19:49.980 --> 19:53.275
Trying to start from scratch.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.737
Looking much better than my
First try.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.821
My gosh.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.281
My forearms hurt so bad.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.032
This is the last piece.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.326
Thank god, rach, we killed It.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.286
Goodbye!

20:04.369 --> 20:05.746
Thank you so much!

20:05.829 --> 20:08.248
Such a workout.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.751
That's why they've all look
Good.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.754
They've lost their pregnancy
Weight by doing laundry.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.297
Do you want a rolex?

20:15.380 --> 20:15.797
Sure.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.299
Much better, yeah.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.468
Much better than the previous
One.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.095
This is perfect.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.474
Rolling a ball, like making a
Pizza in africa.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.351
I'll eat it.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.603
I love uganda!

20:29.686 --> 20:29.811
Yes!

20:29.895 --> 20:32.731
Yes!

20:32.814 --> 20:33.315
Yes!

20:33.398 --> 20:34.983
Jamal just finished.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.777
I'm not going to be far behind
Him.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.153
There we go.

20:38.236 --> 20:44.201
Shoot.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.787
I dropped it on the ground.

20:46.870 --> 20:47.120
Five-second rule.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.789
Rolex.

20:48.872 --> 20:49.247
Rolex.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.123
This is not good.

20:50.207 --> 20:50.999
This way, then.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.378
I can't believe she's still
Is so lost.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.381
I can't fault her, I just
Wish I could help her.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.508
A watch?

20:59.591 --> 21:05.514
Down here?

21:05.597 --> 21:06.390
Excuse me.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.558
My god.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.642
I'm lost.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.361
I'm still looking for the
Vendor.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.546
I have been running for like an
Hour.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.364
Watch, a watch.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.573
You want a watch?

21:23.657 --> 21:27.911
I want a rolex.

21:27.995 --> 21:28.537
No, I need... no.

21:28.620 --> 21:36.620
My god.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.214
Thank you.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.384
Make your way on foot to
Village boat builders.

21:42.467 --> 21:46.596
Let's go this way, nic.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.183
Excuse me, sorry, I'm in a Race.

21:50.267 --> 21:50.892
All right.

21:50.976 --> 21:51.685
See if this one passes the test.

21:51.768 --> 21:55.313
So I'm watching them make a
Rolex.

21:55.397 --> 21:55.731
Good?

21:55.814 --> 21:56.398
Yes.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.233
Thank you, that was very fun.

21:58.317 --> 21:58.859
Let's go.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.610
We got to do this quick.

22:00.694 --> 22:07.075
So it's us against janelle and
Britney, the moms.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.244
This way, there's an arrow.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.621
We can't find the clue box.

22:11.705 --> 22:11.955
This way.

22:12.039 --> 22:12.581
Tyler.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.415
We haven't found it yet.

22:13.498 --> 22:17.210
It's got to be right here
Somewhere.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.588
Village boat builders, right
There.

22:19.671 --> 22:23.216
Clue box has got to be up here,
Guys.

22:23.300 --> 22:27.429
Yes, hi, clue, please.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.806
Or move the pole.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.226
Africa's largest lake is
Home to africa's largest fresh.

22:33.310 --> 22:40.108
Water pitch, the now perch,
Which fishermen catch and.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.319
Preserve in salt.

22:42.402 --> 22:46.990
70% of ugandans use firewood
Like this for cooking.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.494
Suppliers use these huge wooden
Canoes to transport them to the.

22:50.577 --> 22:51.745
City.

22:51.828 --> 22:55.499
Teams will help them by loading
It on a bicycle and delivering.

22:55.582 --> 22:59.127
It here where they must expertly
Stack it like the local dealers.

22:59.211 --> 22:59.628
To get their next clue.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.296
I think the wood.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.799
I think the wood, too, ty.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.927
Let's get out of here before
Teams find it up there.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.470
Tyler, I think it's down Here.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.806
Come on, kor.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.599
Ok, bicycles.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.810
We want a good stacking
Platform.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.479
Ty, this is how you load your
Bike.

23:17.562 --> 23:17.729
How many are there?

23:17.813 --> 23:19.314
40.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.482
You know how many you have?

23:20.565 --> 23:21.650
Yeah, don't talk to me.

23:21.733 --> 23:26.279
11, 12, 14... 15.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.155
A couple of extra doesn't Hurt.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.699
I'm not seeing other teams
Right now.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.700
It's not this way.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.701
It's not this way.

23:31.785 --> 23:37.874
I don't know where britney is.

23:37.958 --> 23:38.667
Everyone's saying it's good.

23:38.750 --> 23:43.964
Come on, be good, be good, be
Good.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.675
Ok, thank god.

23:46.758 --> 23:52.013
Rach, love you, britney.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.849
Come on.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.810
Let's go.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.562
Slow and steady, it's fine.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.730
Holy bump.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.774
Who's my muddy buddy.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.191
It's me.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.069
It's leaning.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.904
It had been raining all day.

24:07.988 --> 24:14.995
It was basically really nasty
Pothole, mud.

24:15.078 --> 24:18.540
Fecal matter mixed in there.

24:18.623 --> 24:24.379
Sloppy challenge.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.882
Ok.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.260
There's a finished example.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.888
These markings, look.

24:32.971 --> 24:33.971
Put it on top of this.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.056
You got to push it.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.600
So two big pieces.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.393
We need two.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.519
Look what they're doing.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.312
We're doing exactly that.

24:40.395 --> 24:44.107
It's our janga.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.692
Move the pole.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.528
We got to get it up there.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.404
The clue's up there?

24:49.487 --> 24:49.779
Yeah.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.949
Damn it!

24:53.033 --> 24:54.409
Move the pole.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.745
Move the pole.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.916
Ok, boss lady!

25:00.999 --> 25:02.959
Who's the boss lady!

25:03.043 --> 25:04.419
Boss lady!

25:04.502 --> 25:05.795
Ok, there you go.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
Keep going all the way.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.423
Let's go, bike.

25:08.506 --> 25:11.426
Here we, go bicycles I know.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.052
Get straight ones.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.303
That's what I'm doing.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.180
What's up, guys?

25:15.263 --> 25:17.599
Where's the brakes.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.227
Hey, over here so it's Quicker.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.771
Careful, chris, don't lean Over.

25:22.854 --> 25:23.438
Seriously, don't lean over.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.814
Slow and steady, let's go.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.816
Watch out for bumps.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.569
Hello, chicken.

25:29.653 --> 25:29.945
Hello, chicken.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.613
Hi, hello.

25:31.696 --> 25:36.618
It was wonderful to see the
People of uganda treat us so.

25:36.701 --> 25:36.993
Warmly.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.286
Hey, hey.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.956
We gave out a lot of positive
Energy and we received a lot of.

25:41.039 --> 25:41.831
It back.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.542
Hello.

25:44.626 --> 25:48.463
I got it.

25:48.546 --> 25:51.967
Christie, are you ready?

25:52.050 --> 25:56.805
Got to lift... no, lift here.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.015
Take your time.

25:59.099 --> 25:59.975
Man.

26:00.058 --> 26:03.603
Season five colin would have
Been deep in it.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.689
Too much wood.

26:05.772 --> 26:10.610
I would have been very
Frustrated, just been a lot more.

26:10.694 --> 26:14.155
Loving and forgiving of myself
So that allows you to be a lot.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.659
More loving and forgiving to
Other people in other.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.368
Situations.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.828
We'll figure it out together.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.664
You want to try to keep it
Balanced.

26:22.747 --> 26:28.211
It's like a giant game of janga.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.046
We got bumpy coming up.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.548
Let's go back for another.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.009
Looking good, buddy, looking
Good.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.176
Let's go, buddy!

26:35.260 --> 26:36.720
Detour.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.639
Let's get out of here.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.641
Britney!

26:41.725 --> 26:43.018
I can't find it.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.187
I cannot find the rolexes.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.065
I'm just going to look close.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.734
A rolex, a rolex.

26:50.817 --> 26:51.836
Says rolex right there.

26:51.860 --> 26:59.860
Maybe this is... no... I'm
Looking for a rolex.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.871
You've got to be kidding me.

27:02.954 --> 27:03.705
Oleggs.

27:03.788 --> 27:08.335
Can you help me with a roll eggs
Stand.

27:08.418 --> 27:08.710
What?

27:08.793 --> 27:09.586
This was it?

27:09.669 --> 27:11.338
It was that easy?

27:11.421 --> 27:13.006
Are you serious?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.883
You got it, go, janelle!

27:14.966 --> 27:21.723
I'm so stupid.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.724
Hand pass, one, two.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.269
We are stacking baby lincoln
Logs.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.228
Right behind you.

27:27.312 --> 27:27.979
Seven, eight, that's it.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.231
Boss lady.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.107
Boss lady.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.543
She's going to measure it
With a stick.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.027
Come on, boss lady.

27:34.110 --> 27:34.235
Yes!

27:34.319 --> 27:34.736
Yes!

27:34.819 --> 27:35.403
Thank you so much.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.155
It's time to go head-to-head.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.743
Drums are among the
World's oldest instruments and.

27:41.826 --> 27:46.790
The percussive sounds of
Uganda's drums have been an.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.143
Intrinsic part of the culture
Here for thousands of years.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.921
They will play a key role in
This season's first.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.940
Head-to-head, when teams try to
Beat their competition by.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.925
Figuring out this puzzle.

27:57.008 --> 28:03.431
Moving one drum at a time, teams
Must arrange them in four.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.809
Color-specific stacks.

28:05.892 --> 28:13.892
Winners will check in with me
Here at the pit stop, jahazi.

28:13.983 --> 28:17.904
Pier on the shore of lake
Victoria.

28:17.987 --> 28:22.450
Losers must drum up the strength
To take on the next team with a.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.494
Final head-to-head ending in
Elimination.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.122
We're heading to jahazi pier.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.289
Two teams behind you.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.541
Two strong teams.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.293
Having seen the head-to-heads
Last season, that was the thing.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.004
We were most afraid of because
It's something we never.

28:35.088 --> 28:35.964
Experienced the first time.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.841
Anything can happen in the
Head-to-head.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.968
Someone can go from first to
Being eliminated.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.636
I would love to get a first
Place.

28:41.719 --> 28:42.637
We're doomed.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.431
I just saw a rainbow.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.642
Boss lady!

28:47.725 --> 28:48.643
Ok, thank you.

28:48.726 --> 28:49.102
Thank you, thank you.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.104
Head-to-head.

28:51.187 --> 28:51.771
Boss lady.

28:51.855 --> 28:56.359
Can you check ours, please?

28:56.443 --> 28:59.070
Yeah.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.866
Thank you so much.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.034
I see the boat up there.

29:05.118 --> 29:11.458
I see the boat up there.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.044
We're almost done, buddy, maybe
One more trip.

29:15.128 --> 29:20.216
Keep holding it, keep holding
It, keep holding it.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.803
Good job, floyd, you're doing
Great.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.890
Here's our wheelbarrows, Rach.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.017
We're mommies, who's a mom?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.102
Will you lead us to the work
Station?

29:31.186 --> 29:35.148
Do you know where it is?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.858
Ok, thank you.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.401
Let's do this.

29:38.485 --> 29:42.822
How do we process our fish?

29:42.906 --> 29:44.866
We just have to put them up
Here.

29:44.949 --> 29:48.203
Put them up to you, here.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.871
Me do it?

29:49.954 --> 29:54.209
Clean it.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.710
Fill out the guts.

29:55.793 --> 29:58.004
I am pulling all the skin to
Make the delicacy.

29:58.087 --> 30:04.385
When I was little, my daddy
Taught us how to gut a fish and.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.113
Clean a fish so we have been
Doing this our whole life.

30:06.137 --> 30:09.015
We've got this so good, girl.

30:09.098 --> 30:13.895
Stack, stack, and then
Inside-out and roll it like.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.355
This.

30:15.438 --> 30:15.563
Yeah.

30:15.647 --> 30:15.897
Ok.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.440
Thank you.

30:17.524 --> 30:21.194
I like our confidence.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.005
In this head-to-head, I would
Like to get it right away.

30:23.029 --> 30:27.325
I'd like to do it, get it the
First try.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.620
First place in uganda would
Not be the worst thing in the.

30:30.703 --> 30:31.204
World.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.080
Thank you, my friend.

30:32.163 --> 30:32.455
Thank you so much.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.122
Thank you.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.958
Those look like the drums.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.585
Drum number one.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.047
You only may move one drum at
A time, you only may stack drums.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.298
On the poles.

30:42.382 --> 30:47.136
When your think your drum stacks
Are correct, grab the ox tail on.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.056
The drum in front of the band
Leader.

30:50.139 --> 30:54.602
The band leader will indicate
Whether your drums are correct.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.478
By stopping the drums.

30:55.562 --> 31:00.483
Cook, cook, cook, we're
Getting close.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.109
Has to be perfect.

31:01.192 --> 31:01.526
Sir.

31:01.609 --> 31:02.110
Thank you.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.904
Go, janelle!

31:04.988 --> 31:05.822
You got it!

31:05.905 --> 31:07.907
Britney!

31:07.991 --> 31:08.449
Let's go.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.742
That was horrible.

31:09.826 --> 31:14.163
We have to catch up.

31:14.247 --> 31:14.956
Right over there.

31:15.039 --> 31:19.752
75,000, stacks of drums.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.589
Number two.

31:22.672 --> 31:26.175
The object of the game is to
Make four stacks of drums.

31:26.259 --> 31:34.183
We're playing a head-to-head
So whoever wins will check in on.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.078
The mat and whoever loses takes
On the next opponent.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.646
We have a shot at first.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.480
Thank you so much.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.650
Number three.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.151
Let's do this.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.570
All right.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.821
Number four.

31:46.904 --> 31:48.281
Three and four.

31:48.364 --> 31:56.364
Playing for two.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.876
We're having a head-to-head.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.795
Our first head-to-head is
Going to be between tyler and.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.964
Korey and colin and christie.

32:05.048 --> 32:08.343
We had run such a flawless
Leg today but to know there was.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.845
One last task was a little
Daunting.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.181
Just because we're in first
Doesn't mean we'll stay in.

32:13.264 --> 32:13.723
First.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.016
Everybody ready?

32:15.099 --> 32:17.018
You got this.

32:25.985 --> 32:26.277
You got this.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.695
Got this!

32:27.779 --> 32:32.742
First head-to-head is
Going to be between tyler and

32:32.825 --> 32:33.201
Colin.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.203
Go, ty!

32:35.286 --> 32:38.206
They have to make four
Distinct stacks of these drums,

32:38.289 --> 32:43.044
Color-specific stacks.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.922
They can only have four drums on
A stack.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.274
They're almost move for move
Right now.

32:47.298 --> 32:54.097
Colin has a method, he's moving
Quickly, but so is tyler.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.557
Another yellow, another Yellow.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.558
Take the blue back.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.769
What?

32:59.852 --> 33:01.229
Tyler has two complete Stacks.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.188
He's now working on green and
Blue.

33:02.271 --> 33:07.193
Right there, babe!

33:07.276 --> 33:08.403
He's really on a roll Here.

33:08.486 --> 33:12.573
He's only two moves away from
Taking his first head-to-head.

33:12.657 --> 33:20.657
Yes, ty!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.376
Tyler has won the first
Head-to-head.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.420
Great job, guys.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.254
Good job, guys.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.967
Thank you.

33:31.050 --> 33:37.765
Welcome to uganda,.

33:37.849 --> 33:42.437
Tyler and korey, I am pleased
To tell you that you are team.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.147
Number one and I have great news
For you.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.608
As winners of this leg of the
Race, you have won a trip for.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.945
Two from travelocity and you're
Going to singapore.

33:51.028 --> 33:56.284
You're going to stay five nights
At the hotel shangrila at

33:56.367 --> 34:01.539
Singapore where you'll enjoy
Deep tissue massages for two and.

34:01.622 --> 34:05.001
Explore all the city has to
Offer with a choice of.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.627
Excursions.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.795
Congratulations.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.023
The emotion of coming to
Uganda, can you talk about that?

34:09.047 --> 34:12.467
People like us don't
Necessarily have the same rights.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.342
As a lot of other people here in
Uganda.

34:14.427 --> 34:18.181
Every person we erin countered
In uganda was nice, helpful,

34:18.264 --> 34:19.431
Welcoming.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.368
Just because the government has
A certain policy doesn't mean.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.311
All the locals agree with it.

34:23.393 --> 34:28.315
Third team to arrive,
Nicole and victor, who will take.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.152
On colin and christie in our
Second head-to-head.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.487
I had a shot at first.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.237
I blew it.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.489
Couldn't figure it out.

34:34.572 --> 34:38.034
It was nerve-racking going into
It against colin because he had.

34:38.117 --> 34:42.789
Played once before.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.873
Drums have been set in a
New heard.

34:44.956 --> 34:50.630
Again, the goal, to get four
Stacks of four distinct colors,

34:50.713 --> 34:56.803
Three drums in each stack.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.973
Victor is moving quickly and
Almost simultaneously colin and

35:01.057 --> 35:03.184
Victor have the red stack
Complete.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.060
Incredibly close.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.370
But victor has completed his
Second stack.

35:05.394 --> 35:08.564
He's got the green now and the
Red.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.484
Ok, colin!

35:11.567 --> 35:14.403
Victor is moving like a
Demon right now, very close to.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.196
Getting the yellow.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.657
Colin has the yellow now.

35:17.740 --> 35:24.914
Stack the green, now!

35:24.997 --> 35:27.041
Victor has three.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.877
Now victor is two moves away
From getting the blue and.

35:29.961 --> 35:30.253
Winning the second head-to-head.

35:30.336 --> 35:34.048
Go, go!

35:34.132 --> 35:40.346
Colin's so close to finishing
And colin overtakes him.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.390
Wow, that was close.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.351
Dang it, we would have got
Second.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.229
Colin and christie, what a
Close head-to-head.

35:48.312 --> 35:53.776
But I'm pleased to tell you that
You're team number two.

35:53.860 --> 35:58.030
Congratulations.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.491
You've been amazing.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.535
Stack drums on the poles.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.579
How do we play this game?

36:04.662 --> 36:06.247
Thank you!

36:06.330 --> 36:07.415
We're in second.

36:07.498 --> 36:12.378
We're now into our third
Head-to-head with victor and

36:12.461 --> 36:13.588
Chris.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.299
Victor was so close to beating
Colin the first time around and.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.526
He's completed his second stack.

36:17.550 --> 36:24.765
He canalcy... can easily see
Where to go with the red.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.767
Three stacks for victor and
There it is.

36:26.851 --> 36:32.273
Victor wins the third
Head-to-head.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.524
Good job, victor!

36:33.608 --> 36:37.069
You had the reds, too.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.672
Could have brought the reds
Right over.

36:38.696 --> 36:39.405
You want to give it a shot?

36:39.488 --> 36:41.407
I'll give it a shot.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.617
Thank you, thank you!

36:42.700 --> 36:46.495
Nicole and victor, I am
Pleased to tell you that on the.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.332

Team number three!

36:49.415 --> 36:51.292
Good job, baby!

36:51.375 --> 36:53.794
It's got to be this right up
Here.

36:53.878 --> 36:54.795
Hello.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.421
Detour.

36:55.504 --> 37:00.635
We'll do salty role.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.765
Here's a wheelbarrow.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.892
The skin goes over here, the
Fish goes over here.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.560
We can get through this.

37:09.644 --> 37:15.316
It's just a barrel.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.027
Bret and floyd facing off
In our fourth head-to-head.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.821
Floyd is working on yellow
And he's got it.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.990
They're even in terms of color
Stacks.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.784
Red is now in the lead.

37:24.867 --> 37:25.868
Floyd has two stacks.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.328
Bret has his third stack.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.289
He's one move away from winning
This head-to-head.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.083
Floyd, go!

37:32.166 --> 37:37.171
Grab the towel!

37:37.254 --> 37:41.509
And he wins the Head-to-head.

37:41.592 --> 37:45.346
You have to get that thing on
The pole.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.682
Wow, I'm impressed.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.183
I'm super proud of him.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.018
He stepped up for us today.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.102
I couldn't do it.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.354
I gave it my best.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.023
He nailed it, it was awesome.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.360
We're now in our fifth
Head-to-head.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.486
Floyd versus leo.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.530
Floyd has two colors lined up.

38:02.613 --> 38:06.033
Green, green.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.244
There you go, leo.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.471
Blue to the left, blue to the
Left.

38:09.495 --> 38:13.833
Get it, get it, get it, get It.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.544
Leo is going as fast as he
Possibly can but at this point

38:16.627 --> 38:19.422
Floyd is now one move away from
Completing the stacks.

38:19.505 --> 38:27.505
He wants this bad and...
I'm going to do it.

38:30.016 --> 38:30.599
Are you sure?

38:30.683 --> 38:35.604
Yeah.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.397
Unstoppable.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.026
You are officially team number
Five.

38:40.109 --> 38:40.568
Congratulations.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.487

38:43.571 --> 38:45.698

38:45.781 --> 38:47.867
Stack them next to each Other.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.661

38:50.745 --> 38:52.788
Good?

38:52.872 --> 38:56.417
Time to go head-to-head.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.253
So there is a shot.

38:59.336 --> 39:02.590
There is a fricking glimmer.

39:02.673 --> 39:03.758
Of home.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.428
We can stay in "Amazing race" if

39:14.643 --> 39:15.936

39:22.526 --> 39:23.611
Two stacks for rachel.

39:23.694 --> 39:28.574

Together and it is a win for the.

39:35.498 --> 39:35.790
Avganimals.

39:35.873 --> 39:39.251

39:39.335 --> 39:40.687
We're getting janelle and
Britney now.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.463
We're fighting for elimination.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.590
You got this, rach.

39:44.673 --> 39:46.300

40:13.828 --> 40:18.666
"Big brother" best friends
Are going head-to-head.

40:18.749 --> 40:19.291
This is all or nothing.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.460
No, no, move the green.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.629
Move the yellow on here.

40:23.712 --> 40:24.213
Rachel.

40:24.296 --> 40:24.755
You got the yellow, rach.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.216
Then go do the yellow.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.510
Yes, yes, yes!

40:29.593 --> 40:30.636
She's got this.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.346
She knows she's got this.

40:32.429 --> 40:34.014
She's got to be feeling
Confident.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.891
Two stacks for rachel.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.351
Britney has yet to make a stack.

40:37.434 --> 40:43.232
Get the yellow, get the
Yellow, get the yellow.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.151
Move the red to the yellow.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.695

Getting three colors.

Away from completing this.

41:00.332 --> 41:00.958

41:17.600 --> 41:18.726
We're going to miss you.

41:18.809 --> 41:26.192
Let's go to the pit stop
Together.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.945
Rachel and elissa, I have
To say, you've made it difficult.

41:30.029 --> 41:34.200
For yourself the last few legs
But you are team number 7 and.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.326
Still in the race.

41:35.409 --> 41:38.746

To arrive and I'm sorry to tell
You you have been eliminated.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.082

41:42.166 --> 41:44.585
I'm going to try to compose
Myself.

41:44.668 --> 41:48.923
Getting eliminated is not really
The end of the world.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.425
My oldest daughter is a
Childhood cancer survivor.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.760
This is really devastating.

41:52.843 --> 41:56.639
We came here to win but it's not
The worst day of my life by a.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.768

42:00.851 --> 42:03.270
Strength from her.

Despite running the worst leg
We've ever ran, I actually had a.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.025
Really great day.

42:08.108 --> 42:11.362
I wanted to prove to my
Daughters that women can work.

42:11.445 --> 42:12.154
Together.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.548
We can make each other Stronger.
