Okay.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.662
<i>People movin' out, people movin' in</i>

02:06.752 --> 02:09.870
<i>Why? Because of the color of the skin</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:11.920
<i>Run, run, run</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:14.590
<i>But you sure can't hide</i>

02:16.178 --> 02:19.262
<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth</i>

02:19.348 --> 02:25.390
<i>Vote for me and I'll set you free</i>

02:28.357 --> 02:32.067
<i>The only person talkin'
'Bout love is the preacher</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:36.905
<i>And it seems nobody's
Interested in learnin'</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:38.322
<i>But the teacher</i>

02:40.535 --> 02:43.699
<i>Segregation, determination,
Demonstration, integration</i>

02:43.789 --> 02:46.532
<i>Aggravation, humiliation,
Obligation to our nation...</i>

02:47.042 --> 02:49.250
The girl can sing. I'll give her that.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.624
Why don't you play
a little hard to get, Romeo?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.095
I'm off duty.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.139
Not anymore.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.229
Driscoll wants to meet.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.056
- Tonight?
- Now.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.773
<i>Oh, sweet Hallelujah</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:25.032
<i>Can't you hear me talkin' to ya
Just a ball of confusion</i>

03:27.499 --> 03:29.741
<i>That's what the world is today</i>

03:33.088 --> 03:36.047
<i>It's just a ball of confusion</i>

03:39.219 --> 03:42.087
<i>Let me hear you, let me hear you
Let me hear you say</i>

03:42.639 --> 03:46.974
<i>Let me hear you, let me hear you
Let me hear you say</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.387
<i>Ball of confusion</i>

03:52.816 --> 03:54.523
This is Detective Daniel Gallagher

03:54.609 --> 03:56.020
with Detective Charles Horvath

03:56.111 --> 04:01.106
of the Vice and Narcotics Unit,
case number 10-0-0-5-4-5-9,

04:01.199 --> 04:04.988
meeting Langford "Lanny" Driscoll
for a first-time felony weight buy.

04:05.662 --> 04:10.202
Time is 21:13. Date: August seven.

04:12.043 --> 04:16.378
Multiple small buys of OxyContin, heroin,
cocaine have previously been purchased

04:16.464 --> 04:20.004
from Michael "Studs" Driscoll,
brother of Lanny Driscoll.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.794
Shakespeare.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.066
Hey, Casey, what's up?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.117
I was just thinking about tonight's game.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.237
Give me some numbers. Make 'em good.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.081
What are you talking about,
she got blown up?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.706
Okay, Casey, listen.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.335
Just settle down.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.040
I'm really sorry this happened. I am.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.841
I don't know if Pierce was involved!

05:01.927 --> 05:04.635
I mean, I didn't know she got blown up
till you told me.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.921
Casey, just calm down.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.507
I'm gonna get into it
for you right away, okay?

05:09.935 --> 05:10.925
You all right?

05:11.311 --> 05:15.351
I'll take the over 100 times,
same thing on the parlay.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.521
We'll talk tomorrow.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.483
The fuck was that about?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.186
That was my grandmother.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.736
She misses you. She says, "Hi."

05:22.823 --> 05:23.904
Somebody got blown up?

05:24.783 --> 05:27.196
Just something I'm working on
to pay the bills.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.527
- How much you down?
- How much am I down?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.989
Ask me after tonight's game, okay?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.909
- You ready for this?
- Let's do it.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.003
I was gonna get laid tonight, asshole.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.006
You can still get laid.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.596
Okay.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.396
So, we're two guys
with something they want.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.857
They don't like what we got,

06:03.947 --> 06:05.028
we walk away.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.733
A hundred says that fat fuck
tosses that cigarette

06:08.827 --> 06:11.661
- before we get to the boat.
- Before we step on the boat?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.953
Before we reach the boat.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.116
- You want the bet or not?
- Yeah, fuck it. I'll take it.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.918
Come on, you fat bastard,
toss the cigarette.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.126
What's up, big fella?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.753
How you guys doin'?

06:31.308 --> 06:32.844
Studs, how ya doin'?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.766
That must be Charlie and Danny.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.434
Thank you for coming.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.597
Studs tells me great things
about you guys.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.523
- I appreciate that.
- It's nice to meet you.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.440
- Danny boy.
- Thanks for taking the time.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.361
My brother likes you, I like you.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.782
Danny, why don't you stay with Studs
for a minute. I need to talk to Charlie.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.448
Charlie, come take a look at this boat.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.281
It's a great boat.
It's like a fuckin' hotel.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.992
Picked it up
from a retired dentist in Florida.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.747
Those fuckin' guys are loaded.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.010
Lookin' good, Studs.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.800
You lose a few?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.181
What are you down to now, whale weight?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.387
Go fuck your hand.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.938
I got a thyroid problem.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.148
- Come on. I'm kidding.
- Don't kid.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.990
Who you lookin' at, you fat fuck?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.779
Who you starin' at?

07:42.337 --> 07:43.293
I need a light.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.673
Thanks.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.299
Sure.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.020
Police! Don't you move!

08:06.987 --> 08:08.319
You fuckin' prick!

09:25.815 --> 09:26.646
Danny! It's me!

09:27.358 --> 09:28.269
It's me!

09:28.818 --> 09:29.979
What the fuck happened?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.694
Driscoll! He made us!

09:34.532 --> 09:36.489
- Are you good?
- Find Driscoll!

09:42.123 --> 09:43.113
Oh Jesus...

09:44.292 --> 09:45.282
Charlie!

09:47.295 --> 09:48.536
He's wired, Charlie!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.458
He's a cop!

09:50.548 --> 09:52.039
- What?
- He's a cop!

09:52.467 --> 09:53.878
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:58.181 --> 09:59.217
Charlie!

10:27.836 --> 10:29.543
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

12:10.021 --> 12:11.182
One time, believe it or not,

12:11.272 --> 12:13.184
there used to be
a whole amusement park here.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.523
Your grandfather used to have
a cigar, cigarette, and tackle shack

12:17.612 --> 12:18.693
over there by the pier.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.237
Where I met your old man.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.279
I would say we were about... 13 years old.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.910
I used to have a little business
selling bait.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.207
One day, two hoods came by,
and they wanted to take my stand.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.126
They kicked the shit out of me.
They took everything.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.705
And I wanted those guys dead.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.207
I wanted that more than anything in life.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.423
I wanted to take my bait knife,
this one right here,

12:44.389 --> 12:46.551
and I wanted to fillet
those sons of bitches.

12:46.975 --> 12:47.965
But your father,

12:48.643 --> 12:51.932
he saw what I was thinking,
and he made me think it through.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.473
He asked me,
"What do you want most in life?"

12:55.566 --> 12:59.105
I said I wanted them dead.
And he says no. He fought me on that.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.482
He said, "What you really want,
is you want your stand back."

13:01.739 --> 13:04.026
So I took his advice
and I moved my stand downriver.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.655
I made more money with that stand
than the first one.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.325
You see what I'm saying?
If it wasn't for your old man,

13:10.415 --> 13:11.826
God knows where I end up.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.532
Maybe dead.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.626
Or maybe worse.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.162
Maybe painted as a bent cop.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.669
Hey, I gotta tell ya, Danny,

13:20.758 --> 13:22.465
I don't think Charlie was painted bent.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.384
I think he was bent.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.266
<i>I think what Charlie loved
most in life was gambling.</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:34.144
And it put him in Driscoll's pocket.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.892
But, fuck it. Doesn't matter what I think.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.393
'Cause Driscoll sat in a courtroom

13:37.483 --> 13:40.351
and told the jury he had his hooks
into you and Charlie.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.187
You got greedy
and pressed him for more money.

13:43.281 --> 13:46.900
The next thing you know, Charlie was dead,
there's a dead narc nobody knew about,

13:46.993 --> 13:48.450
and you're in a fuckin' cell.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.488
- You really believe that, Jimmy?
- I believe what I see and what I hear.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.950
Driscoll had payments and dates
in his books from both you and Charlie.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.875
I never took a nickel.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.794
Well, no, Charlie did
and he kept your end.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.669
- The fuck he did!
- You stuck your head in the sand.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.843
If there's a crime in that,
you've done it, I've done the same.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.263
When's Driscoll up for parole?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.682
Hey, that's not the move.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.643
That is not the move.
The move is go find Kate.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.436
You know they took her joint away?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.980
They trumped up some bullshit,
took her license away,

14:19.067 --> 14:20.148
and closed her down.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.726
- I didn't know that.
- Of course you didn't know that!

14:23.196 --> 14:25.233
Because you're thinking
about something else!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.944
Let me explain something to you.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.870
Every cop in this city hates you,

14:33.956 --> 14:36.323
and they're gonna come after
the thing that you love.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.955
What you need to do is
you need go out and find her.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.002
She's working as a waitress.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.127
As a fucking waitress,
in some joint out in the sticks.

14:44.926 --> 14:45.916
Go find her.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.043
And make a life for yourselves.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.466
Because she's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.802
Jimmy, I killed Driscoll's brother.
He's not the kind of guy to forget that.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.571
- What do you need from me?
- When's he out?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.274
- Sixth of April.
- Sixth of April?

15:10.493 --> 15:12.405
- He gonna make it?
- Of course he's gonna make it.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.613
He turned in two dirty cops,
the judge thanked him for it.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.823
Sixth of April, he's out,
just like you are.

15:19.001 --> 15:19.991
Now listen to me.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.373
I know you're not bent
like Driscoll said you are,

15:22.463 --> 15:25.547
but if you go kill this guy,
that's exactly what you're gonna be.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.876
Charlie was good, he fooled us both.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.555
But, fuck, it's time to move on.
That's the call here.

15:34.976 --> 15:35.966
Let it go.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.933
Jimmy, if I don't believe in Charlie,
I don't believe in anything.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.020
Welcome home, Danny.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.774
Sorry about the stink.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.987
Been hotter than a dog in heat,
and it ain't even summer yet.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.340
Anything else you need, Danny,
whatever, you let me know.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.508
I owe ya.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.544
Wheels?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.755
Cleaned her up, put a new battery in.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.181
Thanks, Jake.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.569
<i>Hello?</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:41.118
<i>Sorry. One second. Hello?</i>

16:41.751 --> 16:42.741
It's me.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.127
Danny?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.755
I got out.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.878
Yeah, I know.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.713
I've been thinking about you.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.799
<i>Yesterday was your birthday.</i>

17:00.561 --> 17:02.302
<i>Christ, you didn't even remember
your birthday?</i>

17:03.940 --> 17:06.102
I'm sorry they took your place, Kate.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.188
They shouldn't have taken it out on you.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.737
I moved on, Danny.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.483
I'm doing all right.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.029
Look, I have to go.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.536
- Wait, Kate.
<i>- You know what hurts the most?</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:26.626
You cut me off.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.292
Like I was the enemy.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.467
Like I was one of them.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.335
<i>And I wasn't.</i>

17:43.312 --> 17:44.428
I just wanna know why.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.692
<i>I would've waited forever.</i>

17:54.490 --> 17:55.776
<i>Don't call again, Danny.</i>

17:56.576 --> 17:58.033
<i>I don't know what you need.</i>

17:58.536 --> 18:00.198
And I don't know how to fix it.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.368
But I hope you do.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.575
Where you at, Danny boy?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.618
Good till about a minute ago, Milty.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.154
It's Milton.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.247
Assume the position, shithead.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.575
Spread 'em, motherfucker.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.585
I do something wrong?

18:50.671 --> 18:51.582
Jaywalking.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.662
Jaywalking?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.669
You lock jaywalkers up these days?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.125
Only the cop killers.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.593
I'm gonna let you go with a warning
this time.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.508
You ever call me "Milty" again,

19:00.598 --> 19:02.715
I'll put a bullet in your fucking head.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.347
<i>What the fuck happened?</i>

19:51.774 --> 19:52.605
<i>Driscoll!</i>

19:53.067 --> 19:53.932
He made us!

19:57.530 --> 19:58.566
Charlie!

20:08.416 --> 20:10.499
<i>Hey, Casey, what's up?</i>

20:10.584 --> 20:12.120
<i>I was just thinking about tonight's game.</i>

20:12.628 --> 20:14.039
<i>Gimme some numbers, make 'em good.</i>

20:31.105 --> 20:32.346
Casey, this is Gallagher.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.745
Charlie was into me for a lot of money,
so he helped me with my sister.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.203
She was having a problem with her husband.
She found out he was hiding money.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.292
What kind of money?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.244
The kind of money you steal from somebody.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.373
She thought if she could find out
who he was stealing it from,

20:59.467 --> 21:02.050
she could use it against him,
try to save their marriage.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.047
It's nuts.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.628
But that's what she wanted, so...

21:05.264 --> 21:07.881
I made a deal with Charlie
to square up the books,

21:09.059 --> 21:11.142
if she could find what Pierce was up to.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.303
That's her husband, Bill.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.563
Bill Pierce.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.644
So Charlie was tracking Pierce.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.190
Yeah, 'cause I was worried
about my sister, all right?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.364
What'd he find out?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.276
Nothing, as far as I know.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.363
That's why I called Charlie that night.
It was Pierce's car, man, it blew up.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.407
Not Jen's.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.410
Jennifer, that was her name.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.248
What'd the cops say?

21:38.339 --> 21:40.501
They bullshitted around,
made a lot of promises

21:40.591 --> 21:42.674
like they were gonna get who did it,
then nothin'.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.343
- You told them about Pierce?
- A thousand times.

21:45.429 --> 21:48.467
They thought since it was Pierce's car,
he might've been the intended target.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.889
It's fuckin' horseshit.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.932
It's an ongoing investigation.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.389
Just wanna make sure
you have my pay ready tomorrow.

21:57.817 --> 21:58.682
Yeah.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.147
Hi.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.732
Hi.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.250
You ever work with Lanny Driscoll?

22:17.795 --> 22:18.785
Lanny Driscoll?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.422
I'm a bookie. Of course I've worked with
him.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.295
What about your sister or Pierce?

22:24.385 --> 22:25.671
Do they know Lanny Driscoll?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.127
Not that I'm aware of.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.553
You think Pierce had something to do

22:28.639 --> 22:30.255
with what happened
to you and Charlie that night?

22:31.725 --> 22:32.761
Him or you.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.726
Listen, man, I don't know you well.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.608
But I knew Charlie.
We were friends, all right?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.436
I don't beat people up unless I have to.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.941
And I don't kill people.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.527
Not friends like Charlie

22:48.617 --> 22:50.859
and not scumbags like my sister's husband.

22:53.581 --> 22:54.867
What did your sister do?

22:55.249 --> 22:57.206
For work? Nothing.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.950
She painted in college.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.003
She actually started taking art classes
again over at the academy,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.588
she found out about Pierce.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.088
- What about Pierce?
- He's an accountant for the government.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.385
He never said much about it.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.337
Treasury Department, I think.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.019
That's Jen.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.019
You know, my sister,
she wasn't an important person,

23:22.109 --> 23:23.270
but she was a good person.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.356
And she deserved more than what she got.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.020
So if you find anything out,

23:27.531 --> 23:29.488
I'd appreciate it
if you let me know about it.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.562
<i>We're at the home
of government official Bill Pierce.</i>

24:04.652 --> 24:08.566
<i>This is where this morning his wife,
Jennifer Pierce, got into a car.</i>

24:08.656 --> 24:10.989
<i>There was an explosion,
and she was killed.</i>

24:11.075 --> 24:14.694
<i>Police are now investigating
the unknown cause of this explosion.</i>

24:14.787 --> 24:16.744
<i>A shock for everyone here
in the neighborhood.</i>

24:16.830 --> 24:20.995
<i>Needless to say, Bill Pierce distraught
by this turn of events.</i>

24:21.085 --> 24:21.916
<i>As you can see,</i>

24:22.002 --> 24:25.996
<i>there are emergency workers,
and investigators, explosives experts...</i>

24:50.030 --> 24:51.020
Hey, buddy?

24:51.115 --> 24:52.651
Yes, sir, what can I do for you?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.232
Jack Bagby, from up on nine.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.613
Listen, I'm a little bit embarrassed.
I'm new here.

24:56.704 --> 25:00.789
I've forgotten the name of the guy
who's talking to Bill Pierce over there.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.955
That's Mr. Loach.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.410
He's a big shot.
You don't wanna forget his name.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.041
Loach? Right! Treasury Department.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.872
Nah, Treasury's across the street.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.127
You are new here, aren't you?

25:10.718 --> 25:11.708
Yeah. Thanks, pal.

25:12.052 --> 25:12.883
Sure thing.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.380
Damn it! I've done it again,
I forgot my card.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.339
I got it.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.929
Thanks, pal. Ten, please.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.409
Can I help you?

26:29.421 --> 26:30.252
Hey, hi!

26:30.339 --> 26:32.752
Jack Bagby,
I got an appointment with Kim Masters.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.957
There's no Kim here.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.759
No Kim? 1114? Department of Interior?

26:36.845 --> 26:38.461
No, this is 1014.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.760
Oh, God, no...

26:43.018 --> 26:44.930
Great! Now I'm late. Terribly sorry.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.182
You're gonna have to go back down
and see the guard.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.810
You won't be able to get to 11
without an elevator pass.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.766
Elevator pass. Got it. Thank you.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.946
<i>There is no sin that cannot be forgiven.</i>

28:24.036 --> 28:26.323
Even when the weight of his sins

28:26.413 --> 28:30.032
has sunk the lost
deep into the lake of fire.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.000
He may be born again.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.581
So today...

28:35.422 --> 28:37.288
I ask you this question;

28:38.383 --> 28:40.466
Where will you go from here?

28:40.552 --> 28:43.670
Will you wade further
into the lake of fire,

28:44.640 --> 28:48.179
thrash among the flames
waiting to be saved?

28:48.644 --> 28:50.601
Or will you save yourself,

28:51.355 --> 28:54.018
depart from evil, and do good?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.895
For the wages of sin

28:57.611 --> 28:58.647
is death.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.937
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.207
So...

30:37.836 --> 30:38.997
I guess I'll be going.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.337
Last night was it for me at Fatty's.

30:42.924 --> 30:43.880
I'm going home.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.000
Home's good.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.261
You know what's strange?

30:53.518 --> 30:54.929
Two years I've been here.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.937
And you're the only person
I'm saying goodbye to.

31:00.776 --> 31:01.812
I bet you got people.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.731
Somebody to say goodbye to.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.484
You'd lose.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.744
<i>Don't call again, Danny.</i>

31:27.803 --> 31:28.714
Thank you.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.262
<i>I don't know what you need.</i>

31:31.681 --> 31:33.263
<i>And I don't know how to fix it.</i>

32:31.700 --> 32:32.690
Yeah?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.901
I'm investigating the death
of Jennifer Pierce.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.538
I'm glad someone's finally
looking into what happened to Jennifer.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.830
You mind telling me about her?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.453
She was good.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.455
Little formal training,
but she had talent.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.165
Did she have any friends here,

32:45.255 --> 32:46.837
anyone she might've had
a personal connection with?

32:47.549 --> 32:48.915
Marcy Williams.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.500
Marcy Williams, who's that?

32:50.594 --> 32:51.584
I'll show you.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.138
This was Jennifer's portrait of Marcy.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.090
Beautiful.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.561
Jennifer was good, but let's face it,
she had a great subject.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.431
Would you mind showing me Marcy's records?

33:05.901 --> 33:07.483
Can't. Don't have any.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.398
What do you mean?

33:09.779 --> 33:12.066
When Jen died, I wanted to contact Marcy.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.568
I checked the registrar.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.240
She was never enrolled.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.160
There's something that I considered
showing the police,

33:18.246 --> 33:19.737
but they never came by to ask.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.286
I don't even know if it's important,
but for some reason I kept it.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.756
That's Jennifer with Marcy.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.454
Stop.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.366
Back it up.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.748
There. Stop.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.717
<i>Okay, Marcy Williams,
Mercedes four-door, right?</i>

34:14.803 --> 34:15.668
Yeah, that's right.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.045
Okay.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.174
Here we go, got it!

34:22.101 --> 34:23.092
Not on file.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.094
That's a red flag.
Usually means government issue.

34:26.648 --> 34:27.684
What agency?

34:27.774 --> 34:29.106
<i>Your guess is as good as mine.</i>

34:30.068 --> 34:31.058
Anything else?

34:31.152 --> 34:34.896
<i>There are 14 licenses issued
under the name "Marcy Williams."</i>

34:34.989 --> 34:37.107
<i>Forty-two under "Marshell Williams."</i>

34:37.199 --> 34:38.940
<i>If you give me an age, I can crosscheck.</i>

34:39.911 --> 34:41.527
Tell you what, I'll let you know.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.320
Hey, G.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.114
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:45.208 --> 34:46.197
I'm glad you're out.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.998
Yeah, me too.

36:01.951 --> 36:02.941
Hello, Marcy.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.868
Actually, it's Rebecca.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.204
- Gallagher.
- I know.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.539
I know everything about you.

36:09.626 --> 36:10.833
What do you know about me?

36:10.919 --> 36:13.332
Well, I know you work
for some government agency:

36:13.421 --> 36:16.084
CIA, FSB, FU2, one of them.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.632
I know you had the police investigation

36:18.718 --> 36:20.300
into the death
of Jennifer Pierce shut down.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.844
I know you were sleeping with Jennifer.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.343
I bet there was no love lost there
when she was murdered.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.095
Anything else?

36:28.395 --> 36:29.806
I liked you better as a blonde.

36:30.897 --> 36:31.887
Give it time.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.056
I don't think so.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.271
Why are you tracking Bill Pierce?

36:36.361 --> 36:37.522
That's my business.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.529
This is who I work for.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.032
That should scare you.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.529
It scares the hell out of me.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.952
What's it got to do with Pierce?

36:47.330 --> 36:49.413
You're interfering
with a major investigation

36:49.499 --> 36:51.081
having to do with national security.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.408
You need to back off.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.956
If you don't back off,
I will force you to back off.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.371
You understand that, right?

36:58.174 --> 36:59.585
Seems pretty clear enough.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.877
My cell is on the card
if you have any questions.

37:04.514 --> 37:05.721
I do have a question.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.975
How much money do you think
a guy like Pierce makes a year?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.848
- Why?
- He's got a young mistress.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.895
He buys her gifts, expensive jewelry,

37:13.982 --> 37:16.645
got a nice place down on the waterfront
with her shacked up.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.439
Be nice to know where he's getting
all that money from.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.864
You sticking your nose into this
is only going to make things worse.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.780
Well, it couldn't get much worse
for Jennifer Pierce, could it?

37:27.620 --> 37:29.202
By the way, you sleeping with her,

37:29.289 --> 37:32.202
was that for God and country and all that
or was that for real?

37:42.927 --> 37:43.917
Eddie!

37:44.304 --> 37:46.546
You want it done right
or you want it done?

37:46.639 --> 37:48.346
And put that cigarette out.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.765
On second thought...

37:54.189 --> 37:55.305
give it here.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.391
What do we got?

38:02.030 --> 38:03.066
Professional.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.492
- Only one?
- That I could find.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.660
You piss somebody off again?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.072
It's a problem of mine.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.186
Put your dick-hands where I can see 'em.

38:41.152 --> 38:41.983
Problem, officer?

38:42.070 --> 38:44.904
- License and registration.
- Okay if I reach into my jacket?

38:44.989 --> 38:47.072
Shut the fuck up and get out the car!

38:54.207 --> 38:55.243
Come on. Let's go.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.373
You know, you two dick twins
are the second team to stop me like this.

38:59.462 --> 39:00.293
"Dick twins?"

39:00.380 --> 39:01.712
Is that what you said, "Dick twins?"

39:01.798 --> 39:04.131
Do you fuckin' think
I look like this fuckin' Uncle Tom?

39:04.217 --> 39:07.130
You think I look like this trailer trash,
inbred motherfucker?

39:07.554 --> 39:08.670
I didn't say that.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.762
You going to jail, scumbag.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.216
- I've been to jail I, didn't like it.
- You like your teeth?

39:13.309 --> 39:14.971
'Cause you're about to lose
a couple molars.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.472
Just tell me what I did wrong.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.725
Well, for starters,
driving with a broken taillight.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.859
Nope. No. He just broke it.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.900
Tonight, you've done nothin'.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.651
But what you have done,

39:28.741 --> 39:29.902
and what you are,

39:30.451 --> 39:32.534
is scumbag, motherfuckin' cop killer.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.612
You think just because
they let you out that

39:34.706 --> 39:36.038
that somehow gets you a free pass.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.660
If that's what you think,

39:38.585 --> 39:39.496
you very wrong.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.077
That's a cute mustache.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.375
Before you do anything stupid,

39:44.924 --> 39:46.131
have a look inside the car.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.550
You see that?

39:49.429 --> 39:51.671
That's a dashcam
uploading everything we say and do

39:51.764 --> 39:53.551
directly to my attorney's server.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.137
That's right, you dumb motherfuckers,

39:56.853 --> 39:58.094
I own you.

39:58.521 --> 39:59.978
So this is what's gonna happen.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.896
You're gonna go back to the precinct,

40:01.983 --> 40:05.397
and you're gonna tell
your fuckhead buddies to back off.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.816
You owe me for a taillight.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.931
Back off!

41:35.535 --> 41:36.525
All right.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.860
We're just about done here.

41:38.246 --> 41:39.407
Anything else you could think of?

41:39.497 --> 41:40.613
Like what?

41:40.707 --> 41:42.790
Like maybe why someone
would wanna kill you.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.325
Aside from half the cops in this city?

41:45.795 --> 41:46.785
Aside from them.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.586
'Cause any of them
woulda done a better job

41:48.673 --> 41:49.914
than what happened here tonight.

41:50.550 --> 41:51.882
Nobody I can think of.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.509
All right. Thanks, doc.

41:55.096 --> 41:58.055
Keep in mind what I got from you
is only one side of the story.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.177
The true side, Frank.

42:01.728 --> 42:04.220
The side that used to count
for something in this city.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.472
After we get the ballistics in on the gun

42:06.566 --> 42:09.024
and find out something
about this guy you say ran off,

42:09.110 --> 42:10.351
we gonna be talkin' again.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.819
Hey, Frank, you get a hit on that gun,

42:13.156 --> 42:14.897
I'd appreciate knowin' where it came from.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.617
What are you, a cop or something?

42:19.078 --> 42:20.410
Let me tell you something, tough guy.

42:20.496 --> 42:23.489
If I find even a smidge of something
I can arrest you for,

42:23.583 --> 42:24.414
I will bury you.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.787
I will fuckin' bury you
and enjoy doing it.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.203
You think I say that
'cause you a bent cop?

42:29.547 --> 42:32.506
Because your partner killed a cop,
a good cop?

42:33.718 --> 42:34.925
Thought crossed my mind.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.301
You'd be wrong.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.712
I'll say that 'cause you a scumbag.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.051
Ask me why you a scumbag.

42:41.601 --> 42:42.842
Why am I a scumbag?

42:43.269 --> 42:47.013
Because I've been on the job
18 years, nine months, and 22 days,

42:47.565 --> 42:49.022
and I don't have a gold shield.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.441
Ask me why I don't have a gold shield.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.190
Why don't you have a gold shield?

42:54.280 --> 42:56.192
'Cause the day
you and your prick partner got caught,

42:56.282 --> 42:58.148
the bosses stopped all promotions

42:58.242 --> 43:01.110
until they completed
an investigation into police corruption.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.491
I still don't have my gold shield.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.748
And that, my friend,
is why you are a scumbag.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.408
We good?

43:09.128 --> 43:09.993
Good as gold.

43:11.047 --> 43:12.037
Have a nice evening.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.546
Hey, Frank!

43:14.092 --> 43:15.628
You got a card?

43:16.511 --> 43:17.877
Just in case I have any questions

43:17.970 --> 43:19.962
or in the unlikely event
that you're not as lousy

43:20.056 --> 43:21.592
at your job as I think you are?

43:24.811 --> 43:25.767
All out.

43:45.873 --> 43:46.704
<i>Hello?</i>

43:47.208 --> 43:49.575
You put a tracking device
underneath my car.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.790
<i>And you took it out, which means
I'm gonna have to put it back.</i>

43:53.339 --> 43:54.830
Someone just tried to kill me.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.632
<i>I don't know anything about that.</i>

43:58.136 --> 44:00.344
I'm sure you don't,
but if it happens again,

44:00.429 --> 44:02.136
I'll be sending your little package
to the media

44:02.223 --> 44:04.715
with everything I know
about the Jennifer Pierce case.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.095
<i>And who the fuck gonna tr...</i>

44:19.866 --> 44:21.402
Who's on the phone?

44:25.246 --> 44:27.784
Who is this, and why you callin'
in the middle of the night?

44:27.874 --> 44:28.705
<i>Jimmy?</i>

44:29.750 --> 44:30.991
Who is it, Jimmy?

44:31.919 --> 44:33.160
Yeah, hold on a second.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.583
Jimmy, who is it?

44:35.882 --> 44:37.418
It's okay. I got this. Go to bed.

44:41.888 --> 44:44.096
Hey, you better be callin' me
'cause you hit the lotto,

44:44.182 --> 44:45.263
because anything else

44:46.392 --> 44:47.599
is gonna be a real problem.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.384
I need a favor.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.019
What's up?

44:51.439 --> 44:53.726
<i>I may have a lead on what happened
that night with Driscoll.</i>

44:55.109 --> 44:56.145
<i>I need files, though.</i>

44:56.402 --> 45:00.237
<i>Unsolved homicide, three years ago,
woman named Jennifer Pierce.</i>

45:01.574 --> 45:02.735
I'll see what I can do.

45:05.161 --> 45:07.403
Meet me at the Anaconda,
1:00, you're buying.

45:09.498 --> 45:10.363
Shame on you, Jimmy.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.254
What am I supposed to do?
Turn my back on him?

45:17.882 --> 45:18.713
Yes.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.129
That's exactly what you're supposed to do.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.551
Just walk away from it.

45:30.144 --> 45:30.975
Please.

45:33.105 --> 45:33.936
Jimmy.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.476
- What about us?
- What ab...

45:39.570 --> 45:41.482
What about all the conversations?

45:47.286 --> 45:48.117
Please.

45:49.956 --> 45:51.037
I'm all he's got.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.754
This place is all fished out.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.382
So I know I haven't lost my touch.

46:16.899 --> 46:18.435
What you wanted on the car bombing.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.686
It's an ongoing investigation so...

46:23.864 --> 46:26.777
The material's highly sensitive,
which means don't ask any questions,

46:26.867 --> 46:29.109
which also means
get the fuck out of my face.

46:29.996 --> 46:32.033
The materials on the forensics that was,

46:32.123 --> 46:33.364
that was more difficult.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.540
Luckily, I had a buddy in forensics.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.492
Somebody shut down access.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.748
- Any idea who?
- Yeah, somebody high up.

46:42.717 --> 46:43.753
What's it all about?

46:46.262 --> 46:48.970
Charlie was working something
on a guy named Pierce.

46:49.056 --> 46:51.048
Husband of the woman who got blown up.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.266
I think that's why Driscoll killed him.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.684
Charlie found out what they were into.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.221
Whatever you're chasing is a dead end.

47:02.361 --> 47:03.897
You have any idea what kind of money

47:03.988 --> 47:06.196
Charlie was into the Shylocks
in this town for?

47:07.283 --> 47:08.569
Forty-two five.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.910
Forty-two five
to three different Shys in this town,

47:11.996 --> 47:13.737
and that's the kinda money
that gets you bent.

47:15.750 --> 47:16.706
April sixth.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.203
- Still on?
- Still on.

47:18.711 --> 47:20.919
You go after Driscoll,
I can't help you, Danny.

47:21.005 --> 47:21.995
You understand that?

47:22.798 --> 47:23.914
I don't want your help.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.260
I don't give a fuck if you want it or not,
I still can't do it.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.259
But I can go back to my original advice,
which is go find Kate,

47:31.974 --> 47:33.715
go to Paraguay

47:33.809 --> 47:36.472
or some godforsaken country
nobody can pronounce,

47:37.521 --> 47:38.762
and make a life for yourself.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.812
<i>Phyllis, it's Gallagher.</i>

47:44.904 --> 47:45.985
Yes?

47:46.072 --> 47:47.859
I need to get a court transcript quickly.

47:48.407 --> 47:49.989
- We know anybody?
<i>- We do.</i>

47:50.076 --> 47:51.157
<i>Whose transcript?</i>

47:51.660 --> 47:52.650
Mine.

48:18.938 --> 48:19.849
Casey.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.681
Just checking in.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.232
Wondering how it's goin'.

48:26.195 --> 48:27.356
How'd you know where I live?

48:27.863 --> 48:28.728
Alexis.

48:29.198 --> 48:31.315
She mentioned it
when I dropped her off at the airport.

48:32.118 --> 48:33.154
She went home, you know?

48:33.744 --> 48:34.655
Yeah.

48:36.288 --> 48:37.278
So?

48:37.623 --> 48:38.955
Well, Pierce doesn't work
for the Treasury.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.533
I don't know what the hell he does,
but he ain't no accountant.

48:41.752 --> 48:42.833
I don't understand.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.128
- Where's your sister's car?
- What?

48:47.091 --> 48:48.377
The bomb blew up Pierce's car.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.174
Why wasn't your sister driving her own?

48:50.261 --> 48:51.422
It was in the shop.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.220
- You know where it is now?
- No. I don't know.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.592
Do you have any idea

48:55.683 --> 48:58.596
why Pierce goes to a church
all the way over in Seidel?

49:00.020 --> 49:02.012
Bill Pierce?
He never went to church in his life.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.310
He's an atheist.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.733
<i>Pray my brothers and sisters,</i>

49:07.820 --> 49:10.904
<i>that our sacrifice
may be acceptable to God,</i>

49:11.490 --> 49:12.651
the Almighty Father.

49:13.242 --> 49:15.450
May the Lord accept
this sacrifice at your hands,

49:15.536 --> 49:18.370
for the praise and glory of his name,

49:18.956 --> 49:20.322
for our good,

49:20.416 --> 49:22.829
and for the good of all his church.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.626
Amen.

49:39.935 --> 49:40.925
Hey, buddy!

49:41.020 --> 49:41.851
You got a minute?

49:41.937 --> 49:42.927
I'm busy at the moment.

49:44.565 --> 49:45.851
Great mass.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.311
I remember you.

49:48.027 --> 49:49.734
I remember everyone
who gives a nice donation.

49:50.279 --> 49:51.190
Gotta tell ya, buddy,

49:51.280 --> 49:54.444
I really enjoyed listening to that priest
who was here the other day.

49:54.533 --> 49:55.694
He was amazing!

49:56.160 --> 49:57.367
Father Bailey's the best.

49:57.745 --> 49:58.576
He's a monsignor.

49:58.954 --> 50:01.367
- Is he around?
- Nope. He's traveling again.

50:02.750 --> 50:03.911
If it wasn't for Father Bailey,

50:04.001 --> 50:05.913
the people of this parish
would have nowhere to pray,

50:06.003 --> 50:06.914
nowhere to eat.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.745
He's turnin' it around.

50:09.089 --> 50:10.921
- Where is he traveling?
- Middle East.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.666
Father Bailey is a missionary

50:12.760 --> 50:14.752
for the United Nations'
World Food Program.

50:14.845 --> 50:15.961
The man's a saint.

50:16.472 --> 50:17.804
I don't know how he does it.

50:18.599 --> 50:19.555
Yeah, me neither.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.135
Stay down!

50:26.857 --> 50:27.768
Get down!

50:29.276 --> 50:30.141
Get down!

51:29.336 --> 51:30.167
Thanks.

51:37.761 --> 51:38.592
<i>Hello?</i>

51:38.971 --> 51:41.008
People keep trying to kill me.
It's getting annoying.

51:41.223 --> 51:42.555
Now my car is gone.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.633
It was ten years old,
had a busted taillight.

51:44.727 --> 51:47.310
It was a piece of shit,
but it was mine, I liked it.

51:47.855 --> 51:48.811
<i>I can't help you.</i>

51:49.356 --> 51:50.563
Actually, you can.

51:50.649 --> 51:51.639
Ask me why.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.566
I learned this trick
from a piece-of-shit cop.

51:53.652 --> 51:54.984
Go ahead, ask me why.

51:55.779 --> 51:56.769
<i>Why?</i>

51:56.864 --> 51:59.777
Because I followed Bill Pierce to a church
so far outside his parish

51:59.867 --> 52:01.403
it might as well have been in China.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.784
He's delivering envelopes to a priest

52:03.871 --> 52:06.033
who travels to the Middle East
every couple of weeks.

52:07.249 --> 52:08.785
<i>Not on the phone. I will meet you.</i>

52:09.543 --> 52:12.001
Great idea. Gas station. Exit 37.

52:37.071 --> 52:39.028
- Get out.
- It's raining.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.276
Get out.

52:49.958 --> 52:50.948
Arms.

53:06.266 --> 53:07.552
In the passenger seat.

53:21.323 --> 53:24.191
What does Pierce do
for the Department of Fiscal Oversight,

53:24.284 --> 53:26.401
which by the way, doesn't actually exist.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.070
He's an analyst.

53:28.622 --> 53:31.239
He's decoding transmissions
between certain countries

53:31.333 --> 53:32.995
that might pose a threat to us.

53:33.836 --> 53:36.579
He's selling those transmissions
to the Iranians.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.997
The monsignor is passing them along.

53:39.758 --> 53:41.124
But we're not after Pierce.

53:42.177 --> 53:45.511
We're after who he's working with,
someone higher up.

53:45.931 --> 53:47.422
Who killed Jennifer Pierce?

53:48.517 --> 53:49.428
The Iranians.

53:50.686 --> 53:51.676
How do you know that?

53:52.438 --> 53:54.555
The bomb was made in Iran

53:55.149 --> 53:57.516
with materials
from the Ukraine and Russia.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.977
If Pierce was working with them,
why would they kill him?

54:00.487 --> 54:03.446
A very important Iranian agent
was recently lost.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.197
"Lost"?

54:07.202 --> 54:08.363
Eliminated.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.737
The bombing was payback.

54:11.373 --> 54:15.242
Pierce's wife had the misfortune
of driving his car

54:15.669 --> 54:17.126
the morning she was killed.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.587
Her name was Jennifer.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.756
You slept with her.
Why can't you say her name?

54:22.509 --> 54:23.625
It was her idea.

54:24.428 --> 54:25.885
Who tried to kill me today?

54:27.014 --> 54:27.845
The agency.

54:27.931 --> 54:28.762
You?

54:29.266 --> 54:30.131
No.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.600
I have been reassigned.

54:36.315 --> 54:37.556
Because I wouldn't do it.

54:38.984 --> 54:40.020
Lose me?

54:40.819 --> 54:42.355
- Yes.
- Why?

54:42.446 --> 54:43.982
Because I think it's wrong.

54:44.698 --> 54:45.779
To lose you.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.233
Why'd you agree to meet today?

54:49.536 --> 54:52.153
To convince you to back off.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.079
Was it the agency in my loft
the other night?

54:57.169 --> 54:58.250
I told you.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.498
It wasn't us.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.467
You're gonna have to start trusting me.

55:11.767 --> 55:12.974
Because if you don't,

55:13.685 --> 55:14.846
you're a dead man.

55:16.355 --> 55:18.517
Aren't you a little bit sorry
for what happened to her?

55:20.067 --> 55:21.057
Yes.

55:25.614 --> 55:29.358
Tell her brother that his sister
died in an accident.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.992
Make up a story that he will believe.

55:59.481 --> 56:00.471
Here you go, man.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.194
Eddie, it could get dirty.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.236
This car?

56:07.322 --> 56:08.654
Never seen it before.

56:08.740 --> 56:09.981
Looks stolen to me.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.946
- Let's go.
- All right, man.

56:33.932 --> 56:34.922
Hey, you.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.012
Here you go.

56:42.107 --> 56:43.097
Thanks.

56:43.734 --> 56:45.191
Are you staying out of trouble?

56:45.277 --> 56:46.188
Absolutely.

56:46.278 --> 56:47.610
Do you wanna get in some?

56:49.281 --> 56:50.192
I'm free tonight.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.069
Now why would you wanna go
and do that to yourself?

56:53.160 --> 56:55.447
Well, what can I say?
I'm a glutton for empty sex.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.369
It's probably my Catholic upbringing.

57:00.834 --> 57:01.824
What's goin' on?

57:02.461 --> 57:03.918
There was a fire at a church.

57:05.088 --> 57:08.377
Monsignor Bailey,
a beloved figure in the parish,

57:08.467 --> 57:10.959
was the only person to die in the fire,

57:11.053 --> 57:14.262
apparently overtaken by smoke inhalation.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.966
That window there
was the monsignor's residence.

57:18.060 --> 57:21.394
The struggling parish was facing
financial troubles of late.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.394
A new monsignor was leading the church
back from the brink of...

57:30.572 --> 57:31.483
It's Mr. Loach.

57:44.378 --> 57:45.459
You can go.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.179
I tried calling you. You didn't answer.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.098
I don't trust you.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.854
- Priest is gone.
- I know.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.348
What happened?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.900
I found out who Pierce
was working with at the agency.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.478
Tom Loach.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.563
His supervisor.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.489
I turned in a report to my superior.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.191
Ten hours later, the priest is dead.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.865
What the hell did you do that for?

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.740
I am not out here
running around unaccountable.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.376
I'm supposed to be tracking down
terrorists and their money sources.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.380
If I can't trust my superiors,
then who can I trust?

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.675
Obviously, it was a mistake.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.378
This goes higher than I thought.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.338
You think?

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:46.427
They're cleaning house.

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:49.845
Pierce is next, then you.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:52.722
Me after.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.272
Where is Pierce?

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.315
I don't know.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:56.688
Gone? Lost?

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.399
More likely hiding,
but they're gonna find him.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.237
I thought you should know.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:07.699
Thanks.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.754
- What's up, G?
- Hey, Dougie, how you doin'?

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.681
I was doin' better a minute ago.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.178
You're back on the job?

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:11.805
I got a private thing.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.979
Here's a list of materials
that was used in the car bombing.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.854
I need to know where they came from,
whether they're foreign or domestic.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.526
I don't do that kinda thing no more.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.313
I'm out. Been out.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.527
And I'd like to stay out.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.651
- I'm giving myself a chance here.
- I gave you a chance.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:29.910
Dougie!

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.321
Everything all right?

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:33.622
Yeah.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.032
G's an old friend.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:40.504
G.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.756
What I got here ain't much.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.175
But that kid? He's mine.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.553
I get it, Dougie. I really do.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.631
This is a one-time deal, okay?

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.851
The battery, the wires,
the timer, even the C-4,

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.231
you can get that stuff anywhere.

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:04.645
You wanna know what?

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.230
Whether it's foreign or domestic.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.531
There's a guy,

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:08.945
Chuck Cumming,

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.364
mad genius with explosives.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.955
Back in the day, he was
the go-to guy for anything and anybody.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.031
Will he talk to me?

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.208
Probably not.
He's gonna think you're a cop.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.419
Tell him you're my friend,

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.880
and, "I remember Bernadette."

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.210
"Bernadette"?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.792
No cop will know anything about that.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:27.793
And if he's not around, don't blame me.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.091
Stranger!

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.926
Wait a goddamn minute!

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.939
Dougie, I'm a friend of Bernadette!

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.144
Bernadette!

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.361
What?

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:10.692
Bernadette!

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:13.987
Bernadette!

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.073
That ANFO could've been made anywhere.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.117
ANFO?

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:27.334
Ammonium nitrate, fertilizer, and oil,
common bullshit.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.336
Device explodes, there are gonna be
elements that are released.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.508
They're called taggants.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:35.551
Same principle for tracing ballistics
on a bullet.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:37.218
But it takes time.

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:38.841
I don't have time.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:46.182
You can try tracing the pipe
back to the plumbing supply source.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:50.019
Same as the timer and the wire,
but that takes time, too.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.740
Wait a minute. Here's something.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.623
I'm so fucking good at what I do.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.324
Passion.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.577
All about passion.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:11.040
Check out the initiator.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.467
The blasting caps.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:15.544
What about 'em?

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.513
They're color-coated
to the manufacturer, right?

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.515
And these colors here,
what we're looking at,

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.138
come from one place and one place only.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.264
Well, where's that?

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:24.636
Atglen.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.559
Atglen?

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.144
Atglen, Greece?

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:29.645
No, Atglen, about 100 miles away.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.567
Atglen.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:31.977
You sure?

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:33.896
What?

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.905
Is there any way this bomb
could've been foreign-made?

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.199
You asking me if I know my shit?

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.081
No.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.334
Can I ask you another question?

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.381
Why not?

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:55.925
Who's Bernadette?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.177
You ever have something,
meant everything to you?

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.598
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.020
Destroys you.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.940
It's like taking your gut and just...

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.601
Spilling it all over the floor.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:15.983
Don't let it get away.

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.236
Ain't nothin' worth shit without it.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:35.215
I need something else from you.

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:36.754
What's that?

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.630
A throwaway.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.844
Something that can't be traced.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:45.684
And a silencer.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:48.019
Give me a day.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.863
Tell me about this.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.750
I'm sure you know all about it.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.171
I want to hear it from you.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:23.381
My partner and I were trying to take down
a drug dealer named Driscoll.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.341
It went sour.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:28.511
There was an undercover narc

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.018
from another operation on the boat
that we didn't know about.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.310
Charlie killed him.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.145
Driscoll got caught.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.859
Painted us as bent.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:39.153
Were you bent?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:40.654
No.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.615
But I'm not so sure about Charlie.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.037
What they did to you,

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.658
they did to my last partner in the field.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.375
A good man who gave them everything.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.170
He hung himself before
they could beat him to the punch.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.053
You lied about the bomb.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.769
It wasn't foreign made.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.479
I needed you to walk away.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.148
You knew Pierce killed his wife.

01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.863
It wasn't important to us.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.073
So you buried the report.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.782
We have secrets, they have secrets.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:36.203
In the end makes no difference whatsoever.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:39.376
Everyone is corrupt.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.084
You're a cop,

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.836
you don't know that,
you don't know anything.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.349
I am not a monster.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.639
I liked Jennifer.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:57.895
Why'd he kill her?

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.777
She was taping his phone conversations.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.946
She knew that whatever he was doing,
it was wrong.

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:05.983
"Something terrible," is what she said.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:10.779
Where's his money?

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.077
I mean, he's obviously
got it stashed somewhere.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.284
I doubt he'd trust the bank,
too easy to trace.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.585
He didn't. I checked.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.622
Okay, so, if I'm him,

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.459
I'm hiding,
just waiting for the right time,

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.626
grab the money, and I'm running.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.637
We find Pierce, make this thing public.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:28.714
It's our best shot.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.988
Hey, buddy, you got a light?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:57.618
Thanks.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.458
Say, do we know each other?

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.465
Jack Bagby, up on nine.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:04.916
Tom Loach.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.384
I don't think so.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:10.718
Must've been just out here
stealing a smoke.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:12.015
It's a great leveler.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.429
Yeah.

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.186
Thanks, pal.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.562
- Yeah?
<i>- I found something.</i>

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.486
<i>I found a ticket for long-term parking.</i>

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:30.943
<i>It was taped to the underside
of Pierce's desk.</i>

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.237
Jennifer Pierce's car.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.947
<i>Has to be where the money is.</i>

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:37.165
Where is it?

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.243
<i>The terminal by the old pier.</i>

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:44.672
I'll meet you there.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:00.396
<i>Hello?</i>

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:01.473
Casey, Gallagher.

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.562
Need you to call a cop named Schumann.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:13:59.929
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:03.887
- Where is she?
- I... Okay! Okay!

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.314
She's here somewhere! I don't know where!
I swear to God!

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.143
Your supervisor, Tom Loach,
isn't feeding you any secrets, is he?

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.067
What?

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.316
You're stealing them on your own
and Rebecca's protecting you, right?

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:14.238
I don't know what you're talking about!

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.278
I said hello to Tom Loach.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.988
He had no idea what I looked like.

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:23.620
If he was trying to kill me,
he'd know what I look like.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.080
He's investigating you and probably her.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.456
He found out about the monsignor.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:28.878
That's why you killed him, right?

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.290
- Right?
- Yes! Yes!

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.583
She made me do it. She's crazy!

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.670
The plan is to kill me then take the car?

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:37.254
- Right!
- And then the car blows up.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.590
- What? No! No!
- Yes! The car blows up!

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.175
Leaving everybody dead but her.

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:42.258
That's her plan.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.016
- Who killed your wife?
- She did.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.722
All I wanted was the money!

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.308
I swear to Christ!
I didn't wanna hurt anyone!

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.610
Rebecca!

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.109
It's over, Rebecca.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.234
Loach knows. I know.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.384
This was never about your partner, was it?

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.128
Probably never had a partner.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.180
It's only about the money.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.383
It's always about the money, isn't it?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.517
And there's a lot of it

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:26.560
inside the trunk of Jennifer's car.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:28.851
We can take it.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:30.064
You and me.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.685
- You fucking bitch.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.773
What do we do with him?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.354
He doesn't count.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:37.898
You fucking...

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.162
Drop it.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.118
- I don't want to die.
- I don't wanna die either.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.077
But if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die last.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:53.997
Neither one of us has to die.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:57.167
He's gone. It's only us.

01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:58.923
Put the gun down.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.596
You don't understand.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:03.969
Nobody cares.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:07.052
I tried giving them everything I had.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:10.139
And they spit it right back in my face.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:14.018
Don't you wanna make them pay
for what they did to you?

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.061
To your partner?

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.233
This is your chance.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:32.122
All I want is to walk away
with all the money

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:33.499
that is inside that car.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.501
And I want you to walk away with me.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.590
Tell me that I can do this.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.003
Tell me that we can do this.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.714
Walk over to the trunk and get the money.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.812
If we don't get blown to hell,
then we can go before they get here.

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:53.440
Before who gets here?

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.067
That's them now.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.148
You're a fucking fool!

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.274
It's a problem of mine.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.486
What makes you think
they're gonna believe you and not me?

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.492
Well, the bullet that killed him
came from the gun you're holding.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:09.618
That oughta do it.

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:12.200
Go on.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.373
Go get the money. There's still time.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:28.823
<i>Hello?</i>

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.617
Is he out?

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.661
<i>He is.</i>

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.418
Turns out Driscoll had nothing to do
with that woman getting blown up.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.811
<i>Meet me at the Anaconda.</i>

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.223
Give me half an hour.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.024
It's a shame a man
can't make a living selling bait.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.287
Forty-two five, Jimmy.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.329
Yeah, I know.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:41.785
Yeah, I gave that up.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:44.538
Must be getting old.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:49.334
Wasn't quite sure
that you picked up on that.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.922
Charlie never told anybody
how much he'd lost, not even me.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.889
I checked the court transcripts,
that figure never came up.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.939
The only way you knew,

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.350
is 'cause Driscoll told you.

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.567
You remember those two hoods
I told you about?

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.859
One day I ran into one of 'em
in the alley.

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:16.286
I made that prick pay.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.031
I gave him a beating he wouldn't forget.

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:22.125
But I went too far.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.919
I cracked his head open on the concrete,
and he was dead.

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:29.041
I looked at the end of the alley there,
and I saw Driscoll, he was watching me.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:33.629
From that day on...

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:36.423
Driscoll owned me.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.177
It don't matter what made you bent, Jimmy.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:44.476
You're either one of them,

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:46.899
or you're one of us.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:54.239
You told him.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.527
You told him we were cops.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.491
He made us!

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.950
Find Driscoll!

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.541
I just told him to turn down the buy.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.423
But instead he tried to turn Charlie.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.800
He bought the 42.5 from the local Shys,

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.258
and he threatened to call it in
if Charlie didn't work for him.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.102
Charlie turned him down.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:26.143
He wasn't bent.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:32.649
I need the address, Jimmy.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:35.782
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna give you the address,

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.777
and then what,
you're gonna go kill Driscoll?

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.279
You think that's gonna make it better?

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.410
Nothing gets better.
You're just gonna get another day.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.707
Just the next day. That's it.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.079
You understand what I'm saying?

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:47.752
If I give you the address,

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.251
then I gotta go to Driscoll
and gotta tell him you're coming.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.339
I loved you, Jimmy.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.632
You're the closest thing
I had to a father.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:02.516
Fuck.

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:12.728
You gotta give up
what you most love in the world,

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:15.484
what you most want.

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:18.782
'Cause that's the thing
that's gonna kill ya.

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:32.713
Here's your goddamn address.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.834
Jimmy, Jimmy Murtha.

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:54.962
Welcome.

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:56.130
Yeah.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:06.716
You're looking well.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.468
Likewise.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.235
- Is he coming?
- He's on his way.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.113
We barely got time to eat.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.284
Look at that!

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:35.878
Beautiful!

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.545
- Nice fish.
- Yeah.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.846
You like fish, Jimmy?

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:51.477
Not so much.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:53.304
This is wild salmon, though.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.974
You have never had it the way I cook it.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.105
I promise you,
you're not gonna leave here hungry.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:04.236
Filet mignon of the ocean.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:06.700
You know, salmon

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:11.039
swim upriver every year
against the current.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.126
Look at that.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:20.923
You got a beer?

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:22.250
In the fridge.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:47.942
You know, up in Alaska,

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.902
they smoke this fish on the beach.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.531
You know that the Inuits

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:55.825
make candy out of this.

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:57.994
They feed it to the kids.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.342
<i>I was up in Alaska years ago.</i>

01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:16.228
I watched them.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.226
They have a place called
The Salmon's Leap.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:22.313
You know, Jimmy,
you gotta admire an animal,

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:23.986
a wild animal that fights its way

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.234
against the current
back to where it came from.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:38.750
Fuck you!

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:28.797
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:31.754
You gave me the wrong address.

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:35.224
<i>I gave you another day!</i>

01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:37.802
Another day!

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.058
- Where are you, Jimmy?
<i>- I...</i>

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:44.733
<i>Jimmy?</i>

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.020
Jimmy?
