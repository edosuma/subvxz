<i>Touch in the dark.</i>

01:44.105 --> 01:46.148
<i>No-one can see.</i>

01:47.566 --> 01:50.111
<i>Touch in the dark.</i>

01:51.904 --> 01:53.180
<i>You...</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:55.157
<i>touch me.</i>

03:44.808 --> 03:49.104
<i>Records are being broken as eastern
Australia bakes in extreme heat.</i>

03:51.315 --> 03:53.275
Did you walk last night?

03:57.446 --> 03:58.739
Tom.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.941
You have got to stop doing that.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.239
Oh, hello, Mr Parker.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.966
Morning, Burtie.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.368
I got the varnish you asked for.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.179
Great. Do you want to go
out the back, get started?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.166
Hi, Burtie.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.101
- Hi, Lily.
- Catherine!

04:28.352 --> 04:30.020
Out the back, Burtie.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.889
Would you put some clothes on, please?

04:39.989 --> 04:41.307
What?

04:41.407 --> 04:42.892
I thought I threw that out.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.785
I rescued it.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.731
Well...

04:48.831 --> 04:50.900
come on, you're going to be late.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.334
Can't you drive us, Mum?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.613
Isn't there a rule that
says school's cancelled

04:55.713 --> 04:56.906
if it's over 40 degrees?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.365
No.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.408
Please?

04:59.508 --> 05:02.094
Catching the bus is a good way
to get to know the other kids.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.955
I don't want to get to know them.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.057
You want to have friends, don't you?

05:08.100 --> 05:10.185
Not from this shithole of a town.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.025
Uh-uh. You know the rules.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.694
Can I have some money, Dad?

06:45.406 --> 06:46.824
Where's your sister?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.102
She's outside, waiting.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.539
We thought we'd get
an ice-cream on the way home.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.459
Dad?

07:03.424 --> 07:04.742
Ice-cream.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.093
That's it.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.723
Don't let her out of your sight, OK?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.725
Is that all?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.994
Thanks, Dad.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.664
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.210
Can you give my brother a cigarette?

08:23.045 --> 08:25.047
Yeah, sure.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.558
You do that yourself?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.211
No.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.857
I like it.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.540
Come with me.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.545
Sure.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.096
Oh! Go, Stevie!

09:17.015 --> 09:19.585
Shit. Jarrah! Jarrah,
what are you doing home?

09:19.685 --> 09:21.562
Uncle Burtie picked me up.

09:22.646 --> 09:23.964
G'day, Jarrah.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.550
Mum, what are you doing with the pig?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.594
Shh! He's not a pig.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.070
Come on, get out.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.176
Hey, Burtie.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.638
Hey, Rae.

09:58.015 --> 10:03.687
Hey, mate, next time you decide
to pick up Jarrah early...

10:05.230 --> 10:06.507
you give us a heads-up?

10:06.607 --> 10:07.983
OK.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.237
Why?

10:15.490 --> 10:17.434
Never mind, mate.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.328
I've gotta go back to work.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.955
Do you want to watch the footy after?

10:23.665 --> 10:25.292
Yeah, sure.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.269
Lily, you in there?

10:49.164 --> 10:50.757
Yeah.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.111
You need anything washed
for the morning?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
Just these, thanks.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.569
Where'd you go after school?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.754
To the skate park.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.094
Did Tommy go with you?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.347
Can't keep calling him Tommy anymore.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.916
Did he?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.810
- What?
- Go with you.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.313
Yeah. Of course.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.610
Lily.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.343
Stop it!

12:00.595 --> 12:02.139
Tommy!

12:18.280 --> 12:19.765
I just thought he was born that way.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.558
No.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.560
He was hit by a car when he was a kid.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.954
- Who was?
- Burtie.

12:26.997 --> 12:30.651
He's got the most amazing scar
on the back of his head.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.528
Well, I just don't want you
distracting him from his work.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.258
Yes, ma'am.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.640
- Dad?
- Mm-hm?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.503
There's a concert coming up
in a couple of weeks

12:49.603 --> 12:51.004
in Coonaburra,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.798
and some of my friends are going,

12:52.898 --> 12:55.467
and I was thinking maybe I could go too.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.302
You must be joking.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.388
No. Why?

12:59.488 --> 13:01.615
I think you know very well why.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.768
Mum?

13:04.868 --> 13:07.187
Lily, you know we can't allow you to...

13:07.287 --> 13:08.772
Oh, for fuck's sake.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.582
Hey. That's enough.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.335
It's just a concert.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.702
- How long do we have to stay here?
- Oh, come on. You love it here.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.846
Shut up. It's all your fault we're here.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.426
- Thanks, guys.
- Lily...

13:37.526 --> 13:40.737
You know, you can be
a real arsehole sometimes, Dad.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.331
I'm just saying
she does whatever she wants.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.861
She's almost as out of control
as you were.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.296
Never cares how it affects anyone else.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.843
Well, you married me.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.354
Sleep here tonight.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.341
It's too bloody hot. Neither
of us will get any sleep.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.926
Mmm. Please?

14:20.895 --> 14:22.870
What are you doing?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.532
Come on. You used to like it
when I did this.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.686
Don't. Don't.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.246
I'll see you in the morning.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.249
'Night.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.266
I hate it here.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.811
What do you think we should
have done, Catherine?

14:56.897 --> 14:59.216
Step backwards for me, this
bloody town. You know that?

14:59.316 --> 15:00.400
Oh!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.094
Yeah, we all know that.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.471
What's that supposed to mean?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.282
What is that supposed to mean?

17:11.164 --> 17:12.574
Oh, God.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.634
Hey, it's me.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.469
Did the kids go in with you
this morning?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.596
No, I left early. Why? Anything wrong?

17:51.696 --> 17:54.949
I guess... I guess I just missed them.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.978
<i>I slept late.</i>

17:58.078 --> 17:59.996
Oh. They must have left just after me.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.876
Cath?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.587
Yeah?

18:09.380 --> 18:12.242
There's... talk of a dust storm
running through later.

18:12.342 --> 18:16.179
<i>So, just make sure everything's
shut up good and tight, OK?</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:19.165
Sure. I will.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.975
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

18:25.814 --> 18:28.008
But... but let me
just get this right. So, you...

18:28.108 --> 18:31.219
you say they haven't been
going to school regularly?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.680
<i>That's correct.
You need to talk to your kids.</i>

18:33.780 --> 18:35.682
I know, but... I mean,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.809
surely that's not just
our responsibility?

18:37.909 --> 18:39.477
<i>Well, you're their parents.</i>

18:39.577 --> 18:41.688
<i>You realise we can't enforce
attendance, can we?</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:44.124
Yes. Yes, I understand that.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.318
<i>Hi. It's Lily. I'm not here.</i>

19:16.406 --> 19:17.348
Oh!

19:34.257 --> 19:37.118
Neil. It's Catherine.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.369
<i>What do you want?</i>

19:38.469 --> 19:41.915
- Is Lily with you?
<i>- What? No.</i>

19:42.015 --> 19:43.917
Come on, tell me the truth.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.877
<i>- She's not here.</i>
- Just...

19:45.977 --> 19:47.545
Please. Come on.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.565
<i>She's not here. Leave us alone.</i>

19:52.692 --> 19:53.593
Matthew?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.345
Hi, love. Coreen,
this is my wife, Catherine.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.806
- You have to come home now.
- This is Burtie's sister.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.224
It's OK. It's just a dust storm.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.726
The... the kids aren't at school.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.394
They aren't anywhere.
You have to come home.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.979
Excuse me.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.272
What's going on?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.233
The kids, they've gone.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.484
Listen...

20:09.584 --> 20:11.986
- Please, you have to come home.
- No, I don't have to come home.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.448
We don't have to do anything like that.
You just go home. You wait for me.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.008
I'll be there as soon as I can.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.886
OK?

20:21.179 --> 20:22.413
Thank you.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.057
Sorry about that.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.336
Catherine.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.115
Have you closed all the windows?

20:57.215 --> 20:59.492
Yes. Yes, I've done it.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.077
You phoned the school?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.079
They haven't been going to school.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.247
Today.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.290
Not just today.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.792
I told you... their schoolbags
are still here.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.587
- I really think we should go to the police.
- No, I'm not going to the police.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.548
Well... I'm not just staying here.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.091
They could be out there in that.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.759
I'm not going through it all again.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.721
Everyone knowing our fucking business.
We're just getting settled here.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.514
Come on, Matthew. This is different.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.616
Tom is gone too.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.203
This is ridiculous. They wouldn't be
stupid enough to be out in this.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.888
They may not have had a choice.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.374
What the...

21:48.474 --> 21:49.726
Shit.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.478
Fuck!

21:54.147 --> 21:55.815
Shit!

23:34.831 --> 23:37.150
Is there anyone... any friends, family,

23:37.250 --> 23:39.235
they might have gone to?

23:39.335 --> 23:42.655
What about from your last place
of residence... Coonaburra?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.073
I called a couple of people,

23:44.173 --> 23:46.034
and they hadn't heard from them.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.427
OK.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.457
Are they on any social networking sites?

23:52.557 --> 23:54.292
They used to be.

23:54.392 --> 23:55.893
Not anymore.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.191
OK.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.995
Lily's been missing before?

24:15.913 --> 24:18.566
That's... oh, that's in there?

24:18.666 --> 24:21.694
Well, this is
the missing persons database.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.405
If she's ever been reported
as missing to police,

24:24.505 --> 24:25.698
then she'll be in there.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.576
Yes, she... well, no... I mean,
she just... It was for two nights,

24:28.676 --> 24:31.262
and I panicked and
I went to the police, and...

24:33.431 --> 24:34.749
and she came back.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.309
OK.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.170
And where did she go then?

24:39.270 --> 24:41.172
She stayed at a friend's house.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.257
Have you called the friend?

24:43.357 --> 24:45.109
Yep. Yep, I have.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.513
Is there anything else?

24:48.613 --> 24:51.307
Anything else you want to tell me?

24:51.407 --> 24:54.619
Any... personal problems?
Medical issues?

24:59.665 --> 25:01.109
No?

25:04.795 --> 25:06.531
Tom walks.

25:06.631 --> 25:09.800
He walks sometimes, at night.

25:11.135 --> 25:14.247
He can't sleep, so he goes out walking.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.207
OK.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.167
Do you know where he goes?

25:18.267 --> 25:21.129
Um... I mean, he just really...
he doesn't go far.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.798
He just sort of goes around the
neighbourhood, really, so...

25:23.898 --> 25:25.425
And further sometimes.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.135
What, out into the desert?

25:27.235 --> 25:28.611
And the gorge.

25:30.905 --> 25:34.325
Um... Lily's never been out with him.

25:35.535 --> 25:39.288
Doesn't mean
she wouldn't have this time.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.376
OK.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.195
Look, 95% of the time,

25:46.295 --> 25:48.531
they'll come back within 24 hours.

25:48.631 --> 25:52.176
We don't usually get emergency
services involved until then.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.463
Who'd you call?

26:03.563 --> 26:08.526
Oh. Melissa and Kylie,
and Tom's friend Jack.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.346
That all?

26:15.992 --> 26:17.493
Neil?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.955
He said she wasn't there.

26:26.419 --> 26:30.464
<i>Hi. It's Lily. I'm not here.</i>

26:45.896 --> 26:47.106
Any word?

26:48.983 --> 26:50.092
No.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.427
Come in.

26:51.527 --> 26:55.906
Can you tell me something more
about why you left Coonaburra?

27:02.496 --> 27:04.081
Mr Parker?

27:07.168 --> 27:08.945
My daughter had a sexual relationship

27:09.045 --> 27:10.947
with one of her teachers.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.757
Neil McPherson.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.011
Have you tried contacting him?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.956
No.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.516
Is that because of
the restraining order?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.588
I'm told you beat him up pretty bad.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.857
You have kids, Detective?

27:31.567 --> 27:34.512
Well, I'm not really here
to talk about me, Mr Parker.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.072
No.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.392
Why didn't you press charges?

27:39.492 --> 27:40.977
I didn't want our daughter's name

27:41.077 --> 27:42.912
to be dragged through the mud.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.708
Thank you.

27:50.795 --> 27:53.631
Why did Lily run away the first time?

27:54.674 --> 27:56.409
I don't believe they have run away.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.952
Was it because of the teacher?

27:58.052 --> 27:59.512
I've already answered that.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.017
We...

28:06.394 --> 28:08.562
We wouldn't let her see him
anymore, so...

28:09.605 --> 28:11.107
Thank you.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.971
And what about Tom?
Was he involved in any of this?

28:17.071 --> 28:18.931
We were all involved.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.601
Look, my kids are out there somewhere.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.810
- Why are you here?
- Catherine.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.471
What...

28:28.703 --> 28:31.576
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. Is Mr Parker there?</i>

28:32.115 --> 28:34.030
Yes. Yes, he's here.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.715
- Hold on.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

28:37.133 --> 28:38.159
Yes?

28:38.259 --> 28:39.593
<i>- Mr Parker?</i>
- Mm-hm.

28:40.845 --> 28:44.165
Do you think Lily could be
seeing someone in town?

28:44.265 --> 28:47.460
Look, the thing with the schoolteacher,

28:47.560 --> 28:48.836
that wasn't her fault.

28:48.936 --> 28:49.962
Yeah.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.423
- Need to open up the pharmacy.
- Oh, come on.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.425
Oh, please. You're not
going to do that now?

28:54.525 --> 28:56.719
- A kid's had an asthma attack.
- Come on, Matthew. Not now.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.346
I don't have a choice.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.097
Excuse me.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.075
- What are you doing?
- I don't have a choice, Catherine.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.295
I'm sorry. Would I be able
to have a look at their rooms?

29:35.357 --> 29:37.359
If they're out there,
how long would they last?

29:39.278 --> 29:40.596
Oh, it's hard to say.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.156
How long?

29:47.453 --> 29:50.523
If they're out there in this
heat, two or three days.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.501
But longer if they have access to water.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.091
You got your work cut out there, Al.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.401
Oh, mate, it is a real shit fight.

30:20.444 --> 30:23.097
Have you heard about
those kids gone missing?

30:23.197 --> 30:26.492
Yeah. Going to go out looking
after we deal with this.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.748
You two guys know Tom and Lily?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.944
Yeah, we've seen 'em about.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.004
It's hard to miss her.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.216
How well do you know her?

30:45.094 --> 30:46.762
He knows her.

30:48.556 --> 30:49.890
What?

30:52.810 --> 30:54.728
You any idea what's going on?

30:58.315 --> 31:00.109
Like, when was the last time
you saw her?

31:03.571 --> 31:06.323
- Yesterday at the skate park.
- Yeah?

31:07.575 --> 31:09.285
What time would that have been?

31:10.494 --> 31:12.288
In the arvo.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.941
You know she's only 15?

31:16.041 --> 31:17.543
Hang on, Rae.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.863
Are you about to accuse
my son of something?

31:20.963 --> 31:22.364
I'm just doing my job, Alan.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.742
Why don't you talk to Burtie, Rae?

31:24.842 --> 31:26.969
Isn't he working up at the house?

31:30.180 --> 31:31.849
I'll see you boys out there.

31:39.023 --> 31:41.425
Do you think maybe one of us
should have stayed at home?

31:41.525 --> 31:43.135
In case they come back?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.404
I thought this is what you wanted to do.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.035
What's this? A fucking search party?

31:52.703 --> 31:55.356
Great. That's just great.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.691
Oh, come on, Matthew. These
people are trying to help us.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.151
Well, they're not
going to find her here.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.736
They'll find her shacked up
with some guy again,

32:00.836 --> 32:02.630
and she'll probably have
dragged Tom with her too.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.466
Wait, what are you doing?

32:08.093 --> 32:10.538
Stop the car. Stop the car.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.222
Stop the fucking car!

32:14.266 --> 32:16.226
This is exactly what she wants.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.431
Look, Uncle! Muni muni!

32:29.531 --> 32:31.283
Sweet.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.959
- Hey, Rae.
- Hey, Burtie.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.736
Hey, Jarrah.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.380
Hey, Rae.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.457
Coreen's inside.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.726
Yeah, no, I'm not here
to see your sister, Burtie.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.526
You know the Parkers?

33:09.947 --> 33:11.991
Are they... they good people?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.160
Yeah.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.249
You heard what's happened?

33:25.379 --> 33:28.549
I mean, you've been working there.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.552
Yeah.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.638
But I don't know anything.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.962
<i>Touch in the dark.</i>

35:31.672 --> 35:34.091
<i>No-one can see.</i>

35:36.176 --> 35:39.388
<i>Touch in the dark.</i>

35:41.014 --> 35:44.126
<i>You touch me.</i>

36:39.990 --> 36:42.451
<i>Only light and dark.</i>

36:43.702 --> 36:45.162
<i>Me.</i>

36:46.246 --> 36:47.623
<i>Strange.</i>

36:49.208 --> 36:51.084
<i>Unfamiliar.</i>

37:02.054 --> 37:03.997
<i>Dizzy...</i>

37:04.097 --> 37:06.058
<i>from beer.</i>

37:09.186 --> 37:11.813
<i>Spit on your hand.</i>

37:14.483 --> 37:16.443
<i>Hold hard.</i>

37:20.197 --> 37:22.324
<i>Skin scrapes.</i>

37:24.159 --> 37:26.328
<i>Back burns.</i>

37:27.579 --> 37:29.206
<i>Close my eyes.</i>

37:30.999 --> 37:33.001
<i>Hold hard.</i>

37:51.395 --> 37:54.381
<i>You inside me</i>

37:54.481 --> 37:56.233
<i>inside you.</i>

38:31.351 --> 38:32.961
<i>Uh, Rae, yeah,</i>

38:33.061 --> 38:35.339
<i>I've just passed over
Cunningham Gully now,</i>

38:35.439 --> 38:37.049
<i>and, uh... just looking down there,</i>

38:37.149 --> 38:39.927
<i>there's more searchers out here as well.</i>

38:41.695 --> 38:43.722
<i>We're going to head back
to the fire station now,</i>

38:43.822 --> 38:46.867
<i>where the command post
is setting up. Over.</i>

38:56.793 --> 38:58.487
Hey, mate, what's the mother doing here?

38:58.587 --> 39:00.339
She wants to be involved.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.215
I think we ought to get you home now.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.442
Someone should be there
in case they call.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.512
Matthew's at work, right?

39:25.197 --> 39:27.766
Yeah. Yeah.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.326
Do you want some water?

39:32.621 --> 39:34.022
Hey, Floyd.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.041
Come here.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.671
I've been talking to a number
of people in town, and, uh...

39:43.924 --> 39:45.284
I can't ignore...

39:45.384 --> 39:46.927
You know, there's talk that...

39:48.053 --> 39:51.264
Lily had relations
with some of the young men.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.460
I'm sorry. I'm not saying it's true.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.212
Around here, some of the blokes

39:57.312 --> 39:59.106
can't even look a woman in the eye.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.344
But can you remember anyone
she might have mentioned?

40:08.698 --> 40:10.200
Catherine?

40:23.839 --> 40:25.465
I found this...

40:26.508 --> 40:28.009
last night.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.139
Matthew can't know anything about it.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.766
OK.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.193
Hi.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.846
Hi.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.806
Coreen. Burtie's sister.

40:49.906 --> 40:52.225
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.202
We thought you may need some supplies.

40:56.413 --> 40:59.358
Oh, right. Thanks for that.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.984
Just some sandwiches.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.861
This is my son, Jarrah.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.838
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.660
Is there anything else you need?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.762
No. No, no.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.666
Maybe Ngatyi
swallowed your kids, missus.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.085
You should sing to him.

41:18.185 --> 41:20.003
That's how they rescued the women.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.713
Who's Ngatyi?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.215
The Rainbow Serpent.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.941
The...?

41:26.109 --> 41:28.428
His nan's been telling him the old ways.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.572
The old stories.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.854
I think we should leave
Ms Parker now, yeah?

41:37.954 --> 41:39.481
You've got Burtie's number.

41:39.581 --> 41:41.942
If you need anything,
just give us a call, yeah?

41:42.042 --> 41:43.084
Yeah.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.388
Stevie. Stevie!

42:11.488 --> 42:13.056
You say nothing to this prick,
you hear me?!

42:13.156 --> 42:14.516
Al, come on. Take it easy.

42:14.616 --> 42:15.934
- It's a fuckin' joke, Pete.
- Alright.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.894
- And you know it!
- Just calm down. Take it easy.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.579
Rae! Rae!

42:21.414 --> 42:22.999
You know it's bullshit.

42:27.963 --> 42:29.714
It's fuckin' bullshit.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.332
Are you Steve?

43:05.875 --> 43:07.043
Nuh.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.046
Which one of you's Steve?

43:11.590 --> 43:12.716
Slug?

43:14.134 --> 43:15.494
Is anyone Slug?

43:15.594 --> 43:18.555
I wouldn't have minded
a ride on her daughter.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.017
This is my boy. This is Tom. He's...

43:24.352 --> 43:26.563
He's missing. You know him?

43:27.772 --> 43:30.884
And this is Lily. You know where she is?

43:30.984 --> 43:32.485
You check The Box?

43:33.403 --> 43:35.614
Heard she spent a lot of time in there.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.074
The what?

43:39.075 --> 43:40.201
Box.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.134
If any of you see my kids,
you let me know. You got it?

43:58.803 --> 43:59.929
Please?

47:32.517 --> 47:34.377
Yeah... just a sec.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.087
Thought you might want a beer.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.689
Yeah.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.862
Sorry, Catherine. You were saying?

47:47.615 --> 47:48.683
Yeah, well, the problem is

47:48.783 --> 47:50.602
if her phone's switched off
or out of battery,

47:50.702 --> 47:52.662
then there's just no way
we can locate it.

47:54.747 --> 47:56.524
OK. Yep. I'll be in touch
if I hear anything.

47:56.624 --> 47:57.609
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:57.709 --> 47:59.569
And, Catherine,
try and get a bit of sleep, OK?

47:59.669 --> 48:01.112
Yeah.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.323
I will, thanks.

48:03.423 --> 48:05.550
Goodnight.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.511
- Sorry about that.
- No worries.

48:25.695 --> 48:27.155
We went over there today.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.532
Where?

48:30.658 --> 48:32.201
The Parker place.

48:33.328 --> 48:35.146
What for?

48:35.246 --> 48:36.648
Just being neighbourly.

48:36.748 --> 48:39.567
Jesus, Coreen.
I'm the investigating officer.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.236
We just took some food over there.

48:41.336 --> 48:44.005
God. Keep your shirt on, dude. Far out.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.264
She's kind of pretty, isn't she?

48:54.140 --> 48:55.642
Who, Lily?

48:56.893 --> 48:58.394
No, the mother.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.190
Yeah.

49:06.027 --> 49:07.654
So, what do you reckon happened?

49:10.865 --> 49:12.325
I can't talk about it.

49:14.452 --> 49:15.912
What?

49:18.665 --> 49:21.876
It's not like I've told anybody
anything you've told me before.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.155
You hungry?

49:26.255 --> 49:27.966
I've got some leftover Chinese.

49:30.343 --> 49:33.162
<i>I like, um... eating.</i>

49:33.262 --> 49:36.207
<i>And I like swimming.</i>

49:36.307 --> 49:38.626
<i>And I like annoying my little brother...</i>

49:38.726 --> 49:39.711
<i>Oh...</i>

49:39.811 --> 49:41.963
<i>who sometimes walks
into my room without knocking.</i>

49:42.063 --> 49:43.840
<i>He sounds like a very handsome fellow.</i>

49:43.940 --> 49:44.941
<i>No, he's not.</i>

49:45.041 --> 49:47.527
<i>And I like hanging out
at the skate park...</i>

49:51.072 --> 49:52.056
Hello?

49:53.533 --> 49:54.684
Hello?

49:57.036 --> 50:00.565
Tom? Hello? Wh-who is this? Tom?

50:00.665 --> 50:01.983
Lily?

50:34.991 --> 50:37.352
- You... can't be here.
- Lily!

50:37.452 --> 50:38.870
Stay.

50:40.246 --> 50:42.754
Neil? What the fuck's he doing here?

50:42.854 --> 50:44.984
- I don't know.
- Get away from my family!

50:45.084 --> 50:46.586
I'm calling the police.

50:47.879 --> 50:49.697
Have you seen my daughter?

50:49.797 --> 50:51.157
No. I haven't seen your daughter.

50:51.257 --> 50:53.910
Where is she?! Where is she?!

50:54.010 --> 50:55.495
I haven't seen your daughter.

50:57.138 --> 50:58.848
Shhh.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.023
Mummy!

51:10.026 --> 51:12.178
Don't you ever come back here!
You hear me?

51:12.278 --> 51:13.696
You hear me?!

51:47.105 --> 51:49.023
Burtie. What the fuck?

51:51.442 --> 51:52.985
I have to tell you something.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.197
What? Come inside.

51:58.533 --> 52:00.451
It's about the Parkers.

52:04.997 --> 52:06.566
I know about you and Lily.

52:06.666 --> 52:09.068
Do you know something
about her disappearance?

52:09.168 --> 52:11.838
No. No.

52:13.256 --> 52:15.716
I'm a police officer, Burtie.

52:16.843 --> 52:18.453
I know that.

52:18.553 --> 52:20.288
I'm not fuckin' stupid.

52:20.388 --> 52:21.973
No, of course you're not.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.649
Have you done something to her?

52:35.111 --> 52:36.904
Me and... Lily...

52:39.240 --> 52:40.741
we're...

52:42.827 --> 52:44.729
I just...

52:44.829 --> 52:46.731
I didn't take her away.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.274
Honest.

52:48.374 --> 52:50.443
She's a minor.

52:50.543 --> 52:52.737
Yeah? Do you understand that?

52:52.837 --> 52:55.364
I can't... I can't know
anything more about it.

52:55.464 --> 52:56.966
OK.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.162
OK, Rae.

53:01.262 --> 53:02.763
Yeah.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.291
I get it.

53:05.391 --> 53:06.809
Yeah?

53:08.519 --> 53:10.605
Something else you want to...
you want to tell me?

53:15.818 --> 53:17.737
She didn't tell me she was going.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.286
OK.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.249
She's out there.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.252
How do you know that?

53:35.129 --> 53:36.714
I don't know.

53:39.467 --> 53:40.968
I can just feel it.

54:48.661 --> 54:50.246
You're unbelievable.

55:35.458 --> 55:36.817
What's up?

55:36.917 --> 55:38.336
We think Darel's found something.

55:39.879 --> 55:40.880
So it's his?

55:42.631 --> 55:44.342
Yeah. It's his.

55:47.094 --> 55:48.371
You didn't listen to me.

55:48.471 --> 55:50.598
We're doing the best we can, Catherine.

55:52.808 --> 55:55.544
Now that the SES are helping us
with the search,

55:55.644 --> 55:57.646
we've got a lot more
resources to call on.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.175
I've notified Matthew.

56:01.275 --> 56:02.902
He didn't listen to me.

56:05.279 --> 56:07.490
I kept saying they were out there.

56:09.653 --> 56:10.868
Fuck.

56:12.745 --> 56:16.274
You know, I had a phone call
last night. It was a hang-up.

56:16.374 --> 56:17.566
OK, I'll get a trace.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.794
What...? Do you think it was them?

56:20.920 --> 56:22.296
I don't know.

56:33.015 --> 56:34.600
I made a copy.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.760
Did you talk to those boys?

56:44.860 --> 56:48.597
Look, they don't have anything to do with
Tom and Lily's disappearance, Catherine.

56:48.697 --> 56:52.393
I'm pretty sure of that.
I mean, Slug is just full of hot air.

56:52.493 --> 56:55.062
Yeah? And without Lily here
to make a claim against Steve,

56:55.162 --> 56:58.791
there's no real case against him,
so I've had to let them go.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.569
And Burtie?

57:01.669 --> 57:03.154
Yeah, I spoke to Burtie.

57:03.254 --> 57:05.089
Look, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

57:09.844 --> 57:12.346
I need you to take me back out there.

57:56.474 --> 57:59.085
You know, we had these red feather fans

57:59.185 --> 58:02.004
from a Christmas costume.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.714
Lily found them and she...

58:03.814 --> 58:06.384
I don't know. She was
six or seven at the time.

58:06.484 --> 58:07.843
She took off all her clothes.

58:07.943 --> 58:10.905
She was dancing around naked and...

58:12.364 --> 58:14.183
It was so beautiful.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.811
It was all just coming from
within her, you know,

58:16.911 --> 58:18.621
and she was free and...

58:20.206 --> 58:23.375
But I think it frightened...
it frightened Matthew.

58:26.504 --> 58:27.963
Yeah.

58:29.298 --> 58:32.134
It was about then that I think
things started to...

58:33.385 --> 58:34.845
to change.

58:38.516 --> 58:39.975
For him.

58:42.061 --> 58:43.812
With us.

58:47.942 --> 58:49.401
Right.

58:56.617 --> 58:58.160
Do you have kids?

59:05.417 --> 59:07.111
Two girls.

59:07.211 --> 59:09.280
Aww!

59:09.380 --> 59:10.865
So, you're married, then?

59:10.965 --> 59:12.258
No.

59:13.759 --> 59:15.219
I was.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.291
- I'm sorry.
- No. Uh...

59:20.391 --> 59:22.668
No, no. It's none of
my business. I should...

59:22.768 --> 59:24.420
No, we, uh...

59:24.520 --> 59:26.230
It's complicated. She...

59:30.859 --> 59:32.736
My wife left me. She, um...

59:35.155 --> 59:36.490
She took the girls, and...

59:37.700 --> 59:39.577
I haven't talked about it for, um...

59:42.621 --> 59:44.190
You know.

59:44.290 --> 59:46.500
I miss them. I miss... I miss...

59:48.961 --> 59:50.921
I don't know. I miss having them around.

59:54.133 --> 59:55.968
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

59:58.846 --> 01:00:00.806
It's alright, truly.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.092
- Could you stop the car, please?
- Yeah.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:14.612
- I just need to get out of the car.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.500
I'm so sorry, Catherine.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.446
It's OK. It's OK.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.176
I'm sorry.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.227
Look, it's alright.
It's alright. It's alright.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.024
It's alright.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.028
We have to keep looking.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:42.408
We have to.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.305
Maybe you should look at home.

01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:09.560
What do you mean?

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:13.589
That's what they do sometimes.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.649
They leave of their own volition.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.445
Because they have to.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.909
Are you talking about your wife?

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:32.458
Yeah.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:35.986
Maybe I am.

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:13.665
You right?

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:24.243
Was it Tom's hat?

01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:25.786
Yeah.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.055
Did they find anything else?

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.060
No.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:35.979
What are you doing about it?

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:38.982
We're doing everything we can,
Mr Parker.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.529
Neil McPherson's
made a complaint against you.

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:47.407
You're lucky
I didn't let them charge you.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.063
It's from the storm.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.816
I need to install one of those
new flush converters.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.151
Listen, Cath...

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.419
Rae thinks Lily's been abused.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.364
Since she was a child.

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.591
That's why she's behaving like this.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.177
Because of the teacher.

01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:11.723
Before the teacher.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.857
Did you ever touch her?

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:25.554
Did you?

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:28.557
Stop it. Catherine, stop it!

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:31.226
I never touched our daughter.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:32.936
Why did you go out
in the middle of the night?

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.314
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Just answer the question.

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:37.065
Why did you go out
in the middle of the night?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.650
Look at me. Why are you doing this?

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.778
Because you're not doing anything!

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.155
You're not doing anything!

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:45.365
You know, it wasn't just Neil.
There's been other boys.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:46.575
There's been boys here.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:49.203
There's been boys
at the skate park. Burtie.

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:51.330
Burtie! Do you hear me?

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:55.392
Burtie, who you let paint
this bloody house! Burtie!

01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.671
- Burtie?
- Yeah.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:02.716
Rae told you this? Hmm?

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.401
Rae knew?

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:18.232
Mr Parker.

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:19.750
Is she in there with you?

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:23.337
- My sister?
- Not your fucking sister!

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.881
Lily!

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:28.634
Lily!

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:33.764
Lily!

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.146
Lily?

01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:46.902
Just come out!

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.357
What are you doing with this?

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.253
Did you touch my daughter?

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.865
Talk to me. Tell me. Did you touch her?

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:08.949
Please, Mr Parker.

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.802
Why don't you fucking answer
the question?

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:15.247
Did you touch my daughter?

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:16.707
I don't know where they are.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.720
Wake up.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.763
Wake the fuck up! Wake up!

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:35.158
Uncle?

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:16.266
So, what's the big problem?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.035
He beat up Burtie.

01:07:19.453 --> 01:07:21.146
Who did?

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.874
That fuckwit Matthew Parker!

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:28.695
What are you gonna do, Rae?

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.239
Well, what does Burtie
want to do? Is he alright?

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.950
Jesus, Rae! Never mind Burtie!

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.701
I want to know what you're gonna do

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.161
about that fuckin' psycho!

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.080
No, he's not a psycho.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.724
He beat my brother up for no reason.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:43.126
No, he had a reason.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.436
What?

01:07:46.772 --> 01:07:48.315
Well, I want to know the reason.

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:53.236
Jesus, Rae, are you taking
their side on everything now?!

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.182
I'm investigating the disappearance
of their children, right?

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.266
It's my job.

01:07:58.366 --> 01:07:59.826
There's something else going on!

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.689
- It's because of her, isn't it?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:07.751
Every breath they take
is a breath without their kids!

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:13.490
I mean, can you even begin to
imagine what that feels like?

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.050
Yeah, Rae.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.551
I can.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.680
I have a child, remember?

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:28.814
Yeah.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.218
You know, people are saying
they murdered them.

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.904
Oh, Jesus Christ, Coreen.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.617
Burtie was having sex with
their 15-year-old daughter.

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.645
OK?

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:46.206
What?

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.191
Tom! Tom!

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:18.029
Lily! Lily!

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:21.950
Lily!

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.411
Tommy!

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.435
<i>Hi. It's Lily. I'm not here.</i>

01:09:57.903 --> 01:09:59.346
Hello?

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.532
Lily? Lily!

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.019
Who is this?

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.579
Who...?

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:10.065
Hello?

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:11.817
Hello!

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.710
<i>Your daughter's a whore.</i>

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.063
Mr Parker?

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.580
Burtie.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.275
Hey, Burtie.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.339
- Is Mr Parker in?
- No. Why?

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.660
What happened?

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.595
Well, um... I think I...

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.000
I need to talk to him.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.435
Come in. Sit down.

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:40.799
Come on.

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.692
I'm gonna put something on it.

01:12:45.612 --> 01:12:47.322
It's alright.

01:13:11.338 --> 01:13:13.056
Looks swollen.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:25.443
This is Lily's top.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.988
I know.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.755
Do you like it?

01:13:46.965 --> 01:13:48.491
Yes.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:03.356
Stand up.

01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:10.864
Come on. Stand up.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.542
Do I smell like her?

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.088
Do I?

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:30.049
Do I look like her?

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.278
Sorry, Mrs Parker.

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:57.744
Don't...

01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.373
Don't tell Lily.

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.508
Where is he?

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.134
- Where is he?
- In here.

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:55.220
- Where?
- Here.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.888
- What about Lily?
- No.

01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:58.448
Cath. Cath!

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.059
Tommy!

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:02.519
Tom...

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:03.895
Oh, my Tommy!

01:17:04.514 --> 01:17:06.481
Oh, my baby!

01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:09.459
Tommy! Oh, my baby!

01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:12.962
Tommy! Oh!

01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:22.413
Baby Tommy. Huh?

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.082
Tommy.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:25.583
What is wrong with him?

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:27.418
I don't know.
He can't talk, he won't talk.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.046
It's the dehydration.
It causes delirium.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.689
Shock, maybe.

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:34.467
It's your mum.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.069
It's your dad.

01:17:39.447 --> 01:17:41.491
Come on. Look at me.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.620
It's me.

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.989
Tommy? Where's Lily?

01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:58.324
You need to show me
where you found him right away.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.535
Tommy, where's Lily?
Where's your sister?

01:18:00.635 --> 01:18:02.553
Where's your sister?

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.000
If she's still out there somewhere,

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.103
we haven't got a lot of time...
less than 24 hours.

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:16.009
Matthew?

01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:20.263
I just have to ask myself
how it is you found him.

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:22.348
I just assumed you lot were incompetent.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:24.450
So I started looking
in the opposite direction.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.286
And guess what.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.357
I know you beat up Burtie.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:34.068
You're going to arrest me for that?

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.129
- No.
- No.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:40.742
No, you're more interested in whether
or not I molested my daughter.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.118
Did you?

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.720
Did I?

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:46.789
You disgust me.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:49.584
Well, you know that's what a lot
of other people are going to be thinking.

01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:51.294
You know damn well who has.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:54.088
You knew Burtie was having sex
with my daughter and you did nothing.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:55.798
- Actually, I didn't know.
- Bullshit.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.442
You knew and you did nothing.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.649
<i>We've covered about 5km so far today.</i>

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.567
<i>Pretty rough through the valley.</i>

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.586
<i>We don't know what
we're going to find...</i>

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:35.773
Nothing.

01:20:37.034 --> 01:20:39.107
Any change?

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:53.224
Someone's been calling.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.353
- What do you mean, calling?
- Oh...

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.107
They've been hanging up, and it's...

01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:06.863
- A few times.
- When?

01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:10.074
Oh...

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:14.787
Yesterday. Yesterday, I think.

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:17.665
You tell Rae?

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:29.552
They said she was a whore.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:44.066
Are we bad parents? Are we?

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:48.613
Matthew?

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:53.075
Did I do something wrong?

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:55.870
Did I?

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:01.876
What?

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:04.629
What?

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:07.590
What?!

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.594
Well, she didn't get it from me.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.180
Did she?

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.335
Did she?

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.479
She didn't get it from me.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.748
Can you let me out?

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.501
Stop the car.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.475
Have you heard about
all those UFO sightings

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:18.060
out by Belconnel?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.396
I reckon it was aliens
who took those kids.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.607
They love the desert.
They can land their shit there.

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:24.417
I reckon that girl's a goner.

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.820
She's totally fucked.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.423
Don't they usually reckon
it's one of the family?

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.230
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.593
- You're Jarrah's grandmother, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.596
Uh, Jarrah... Jarrah told me a story.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:57.266
He told me about the, uh...
the Rainbow Serpent.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.994
And how the women...
the women were saved.

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.772
Can you help me find my daughter?

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:05.191
- I don't know anything.
- No, no, no. Yes, you do.

01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:07.193
That Jarrah, he's got a big imagination.

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:10.363
No. Please, please, please. Help me.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:11.922
Help me.

01:24:13.174 --> 01:24:14.633
Please.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:20.831
What? What?

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:23.292
First it was the white ones.

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.144
Then it was the black ones.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:29.482
Kids go missing out here.

01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:33.986
It's the land.

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.782
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.539
Wait.

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.552
What are you doing?

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.472
I took him out. Here.

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:32.338
Hold on to these.

01:26:32.438 --> 01:26:34.982
Look, I know what I'm doing, OK?

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:39.678
Are you hungry?

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:42.865
You need a drink?

01:26:44.408 --> 01:26:45.976
Is there anything for him to eat?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.583
Tom.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.805
I have to run to the supermarket.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.000
Keep an eye on him, OK?

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.752
Yeah.

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:13.520
OK.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.477
It's alright. There's no news.

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:59.525
I thought I'd give it
one more try with Tom.

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:04.054
Go for it. He's in there.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:06.073
He won't say anything.

01:28:09.994 --> 01:28:13.372
Now, Tom, we all really
need your help, mate.

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:19.128
He's not going to help you.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:25.175
Yep. Want to leave me alone
with him for a minute?

01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:31.265
You know things.

01:28:32.558 --> 01:28:34.935
You... know things.

01:28:46.739 --> 01:28:50.242
Mate, did you and Lily
leave here together?

01:28:59.168 --> 01:29:01.170
Were you going somewhere?

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.434
Did you meet someone?

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:22.983
Yeah?

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:34.953
Or did you just get lost
down there, mate?

01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:43.629
Tom.

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:50.786
Tom, Lily... Lily won't make it
past today if she's out there.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.346
You understand that, don't you?

01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:10.948
OK, mate. Thanks.
You take care of yourself.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.877
I'm really sorry, Catherine.

01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:26.922
I don't...

01:30:30.556 --> 01:30:32.305
I'll let myself out.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.721
You be patient with him, eh?

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:53.223
You need to talk now.

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:55.409
You look at me. You look at me.

01:30:57.536 --> 01:30:59.496
Look at me.

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:03.041
Was she meeting someone?

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.587
Talk to me.

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.117
Your sister needs you to talk.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:14.761
Where were you going? Hmm? Hmm?

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:18.707
Why won't you speak?

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.793
Speak to me, you...

01:31:20.893 --> 01:31:22.961
Speak to me now!

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:26.215
Your sister is going to die!
You speak to me now!

01:31:26.315 --> 01:31:27.674
- You hear me?!
- Catherine!

01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:28.967
- You speak!
- Get off him!

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:30.469
- What are you doing?! Get off!
- No!

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:32.654
Leave him alone! Get a hold of yourself!

01:31:34.281 --> 01:31:35.974
I'm sorry. He knows.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:38.118
It's OK. It's OK.

01:31:41.202 --> 01:31:43.239
It's going to be alright.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:51.298
- It's OK.
- She got into a car.

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:01.041
What car, Tommy? Hmm? What car?

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:03.001
Did you see the driver?

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:04.853
Hmm? The licence plate?

01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:07.689
It was too dark.

01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:11.885
Tommy, why didn't you say something?

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.612
I was scared.

01:32:15.447 --> 01:32:16.907
I should have gone with her.

01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:21.270
No. No.

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:22.913
It's not your fault.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.001
No, it's not your fault.

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:31.964
It's not your fault.

01:32:33.507 --> 01:32:34.967
<i>Mr Parker?</i>

01:32:36.343 --> 01:32:37.828
<i>Are you still there?</i>

01:32:37.928 --> 01:32:39.429
Yes.

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:42.458
<i>I asked you about the car she got into.</i>

01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:46.003
He doesn't know.
He said it was too dark.

01:32:46.103 --> 01:32:48.422
<i>OK, then we'll get a police
officer over to talk to him.</i>

01:32:48.522 --> 01:32:51.341
Don't. I don't want it to be Rae.

01:32:51.441 --> 01:32:52.943
<i>OK.</i>

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.328
Something happen?

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:08.041
I was just about to go
back out there. You alright?

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.257
Don't.

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:18.327
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:20.470
Please! Please.

01:33:21.972 --> 01:33:23.874
Please. Please hold me.

01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:25.392
Hold me, please.

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:39.306
I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:40.891
- What?
- Catherine...

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:42.451
What is it?!

01:33:44.544 --> 01:33:47.773
- What's wrong with me?!
- There's nothing wrong with you.

01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:50.692
What? Why? Why?

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:52.861
What? What?

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.379
What is it?

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:21.223
Hello?

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:22.975
<i>It's Matthew.</i>

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:24.618
<i>Is Catherine with you?</i>

01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:27.521
No.

01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:29.081
<i>Do you know where she is?</i>

01:34:30.499 --> 01:34:31.958
No, she...

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.797
Lily!

01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:42.844
Lily!

01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:47.541
Lily! Lily!

01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:52.254
BRING HER BACK!

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:55.591
Bring her back! Bring her back!

01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:58.570
Bring her back!

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:03.573
Bring...

01:35:28.432 --> 01:35:30.000
- <i>Touch...</i>
- Touch.

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.768
<i>...in the dark.</i>

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.397
<i>No-one can see.</i>

01:35:37.816 --> 01:35:41.303
<i>Touch in the dark.</i>

01:35:41.403 --> 01:35:44.640
<i>You touch me.</i>

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.199
Me...

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.504
Fuck me sideways.

01:36:57.604 --> 01:36:59.064
Oi, Steve. Oi!

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.201
Oi, Dad.

01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:28.134
Mum, Mum, Mum! Mum, come look.

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.872
Stevie, get the doc.

01:37:31.972 --> 01:37:33.431
Now.

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:46.386
Catherine.

01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:49.389
Hey, Mrs Parker. Are you alright?

01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:50.557
Hey.

01:37:57.038 --> 01:37:59.457
I got you. I got you. I got you.

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.752
I got you. I got you.

01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:06.506
I got you. I got you.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.679
- Is she alright?
- No, I don't need your help.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:17.934
I've got you. I've got you.
You're safe. You're safe now.

01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:26.151
Watch your head.

01:39:37.222 --> 01:39:38.723
Tom...

01:39:42.644 --> 01:39:44.604
saw Lily leave.

01:39:53.697 --> 01:39:55.782
She got into a car.

01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:02.747
That's all we know.

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:06.126
Oh.

01:40:59.471 --> 01:41:00.930
We need you back.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.379
Catherine, you need to come back.

01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:08.980
Tom needs you.

01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:12.734
I need you.

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:25.497
There's something I have to tell you.

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:33.046
I saw them leave that night.

01:41:39.552 --> 01:41:41.137
I was so fucking angry.

01:41:43.515 --> 01:41:46.167
I went inside to get my keys
to go after them,

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.769
but then I stopped.

01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:53.066
I just stopped.

01:41:58.029 --> 01:41:59.781
I wanted to punish her.

01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:08.289
I'm sorry.

01:42:15.004 --> 01:42:16.798
You want me to go?

01:42:39.112 --> 01:42:40.780
Maybe she has run away.

01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:47.620
She left her diary.

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:52.250
I kept it from you.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.963
I shouldn't have done that.

01:43:51.226 --> 01:43:52.977
Tom, I'm sorry.

01:43:55.688 --> 01:43:57.398
So sorry.

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:18.628
You sleep.

01:44:20.046 --> 01:44:21.547
OK?

01:45:04.757 --> 01:45:06.801
Looks like it's gonna rain.

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:24.319
If I could just take back that moment...

01:46:56.786 --> 01:46:59.705
<i>There is a stillness in the air...</i>

01:47:01.082 --> 01:47:02.708
<i>and I am in it.</i>

01:47:04.043 --> 01:47:05.878
<i>There are no sounds.</i>

01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.840
<i>No whispers.</i>

01:47:10.425 --> 01:47:11.884
<i>No shadows.</i>

01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:14.387
<i>No darkness.</i>

01:47:15.513 --> 01:47:17.098
<i>And just for a moment...</i>

01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:19.934
<i>there is no you.</i>

01:47:20.935 --> 01:47:22.437
<i>No me.</i>

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:26.732
<i>And I'm not lost.</i>

01:47:27.305 --> 01:47:33.743
