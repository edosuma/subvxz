WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.370
Oh, great.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.096
It's been a hell of a week.

00:07.098 --> 00:11.133
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing myself.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.132
Hey, Kate, Kevin and I

00:16.134 --> 00:18.367
were just talking about
going out to the cabin.

00:18.369 --> 00:19.936
You want to join us?

00:19.938 --> 00:21.491
Can you do this?

00:21.493 --> 00:23.006
Can you be the man
that I need you to be?

00:23.008 --> 00:25.766
Can you be the father
that Jack needs you to be?

00:25.768 --> 00:28.595
You go to the cabin,
and leave Jack here with me.

00:28.597 --> 00:29.768
I'll take care of him.

00:29.770 --> 00:31.782
I need to spend time with my son.

00:31.784 --> 00:34.390
You want to waste your
life just working at a stupid job?

00:34.392 --> 00:37.523
- That's fine, but I have bigger plans, okay?
- Marc, please, please slow down!

00:37.525 --> 00:39.692
I'm worried about Kate.

00:39.694 --> 00:43.295
I think she's in trouble, Kev.

00:43.297 --> 00:44.964
We have to go get her.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.740
Can anyone tell me what
I'm holding in my hands?

00:50.742 --> 00:52.275
- A lunch box?
- No, not a lunch box.

00:52.277 --> 00:54.778
- It looks like a lunch box.
- Well, I know that it

00:54.780 --> 00:58.114
looks like a lunch box, but
this is actually a time capsule.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.650
- Ooh.
- I water-proofed it, I dirt-proofed it.

01:00.652 --> 01:02.483
This can withstand all the elements.

01:02.485 --> 01:05.021
I could be watching Jurassic
Park with Sophie right now.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.859
Kevin, don't be fresh.

01:06.861 --> 01:10.963
This matters a lot to your dad.
And... to me, to both of us.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.031
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.499
This is gonna be great.

01:13.501 --> 01:16.002
I have always wanted to do one of these.

01:16.004 --> 01:18.315
So, each of you guys is
gonna pick something special

01:18.317 --> 01:20.339
to put inside the capsule.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.708
All right, then we're gonna,
we're gonna bury the capsule.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.277
And when you turn 18,
we're gonna come back

01:24.279 --> 01:26.742
and we're gonna dig it up.

01:26.744 --> 01:29.067
So, figure out what you want to bury,

01:29.069 --> 01:30.950
and put it in here, okay?

01:30.952 --> 01:33.286
I'm hitchhiking back to Pittsburgh.

01:33.288 --> 01:35.921
Nice, Kev.

01:35.923 --> 01:38.124
You know, Bec, I don't know

01:38.126 --> 01:39.992
if you're actually into this whole thing

01:39.994 --> 01:42.028
or you're just humoring me,
but either way, thank you.

01:42.030 --> 01:43.529
Eh, what can I say?

01:43.531 --> 01:46.465
You're very, very cute.

01:48.102 --> 01:50.236
- I love it out here.
- Me, too.

01:50.238 --> 01:52.271
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:52.273 --> 01:55.074
What are you gonna
put in your time capsule?

01:59.332 --> 02:00.521
Well, here we are.

02:00.523 --> 02:02.624
Pearson family cabin.

02:04.285 --> 02:06.252
I'm really sorry about before.

02:06.254 --> 02:09.655
I... I love you so much.

02:09.657 --> 02:11.658
You still love me, right?

02:12.860 --> 02:16.163
Of course I still love you.

02:17.198 --> 02:18.899
Good.

02:20.968 --> 02:22.835
Come on.

02:22.837 --> 02:24.036
I'm gonna kick his ass.

02:24.038 --> 02:25.071
Stop it.

02:25.073 --> 02:27.073
No one is kicking anyone's ass.

02:27.075 --> 02:29.408
I'm sure I'm just being paranoid.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.301
No, you're not... the fact that
you let that creep take Kate

02:32.303 --> 02:34.580
to a cabin in the middle
of the woods is insane.

02:34.582 --> 02:36.272
Hey, you have no idea
what you're talking about,

02:36.274 --> 02:37.927
- because you're never here.
- Can't be an actor

02:37.929 --> 02:39.485
- in Pittsburgh, Randall.
- Oh, yeah.

02:39.487 --> 02:41.966
'Cause God forbid you miss out
on Guy Drinking Sunny Delight.

02:41.968 --> 02:43.060
It's a national commercial,

02:43.062 --> 02:44.569
- thank you very much.
- That's totally gonna

02:44.571 --> 02:46.413
- win you an Academy Award.
- Shut up. Seriously?

02:46.415 --> 02:48.861
Guys, can you please cut it out?
Come on, it is dark

02:48.863 --> 02:51.308
and slippery, all right?
I don't need the two of you

02:51.310 --> 02:53.699
going at it right now.

02:53.701 --> 02:54.767
Sorry.

02:54.769 --> 02:56.570
Sorry, Mom.

03:00.281 --> 03:05.281

- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

03:08.048 --> 03:09.504
All done.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.896
That's it? Ah, no, there's still

03:11.898 --> 03:13.898
a blank spot over here...
hit me with another tulip.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.169
Dad, I got to go finish
packing for Grandma's.

03:16.171 --> 03:17.671
Have fun at the cabin.

03:17.673 --> 03:19.105
Thanks, Pop-Tart.

03:19.107 --> 03:21.241
Hey, baby, you better hit the road

03:21.243 --> 03:22.943
before traffic gets bad.

03:22.945 --> 03:24.301
You sure you don't want me to come

03:24.303 --> 03:25.645
with you guys to visit your mom?

03:25.647 --> 03:26.980
I am sure.

03:26.982 --> 03:28.682
You need to relax.

03:28.684 --> 03:31.284
Take a break from all things
burglaries and muggings.

03:31.286 --> 03:32.619
Attempted mugging.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.754
That's right, Batman.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.256
My mistake.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.791
"Batman"?

03:37.793 --> 03:39.392
- Mm-hmm.
- I like that.

03:39.394 --> 03:40.894
Oh, yeah?

03:40.896 --> 03:43.563
Well, when you get
back, we're using that.

03:43.565 --> 03:45.832
Yeah, Jae-won calls me Batman, too.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.601
Mm-hmm, we're no longer using that.

03:47.603 --> 03:51.605
- Oh...
- We are gonna be safe and sound at my mom's.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.708
All right, we have security
cameras streaming a live feed

03:54.710 --> 03:58.044
over every door, window
and crack in this house.

03:58.046 --> 03:59.312
So, go.

03:59.314 --> 04:02.616
Be with your siblings.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.786
The fresh mountain air
will do you some good.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.022
All right.

04:09.024 --> 04:11.291
Fine.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.460
But, uh, for the record,

04:13.462 --> 04:15.110
you don't need to worry about me, okay?

04:15.112 --> 04:16.396
I'm good.

04:16.398 --> 04:18.697
- I promise.
- I'm glad, babe.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.197
And, hey, at least you don't
have to hide the truth about

04:21.199 --> 04:23.270
your mom from Kate anymore.

04:23.272 --> 04:27.074
No... I just have to
hide it from my brother.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.814
Hey.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.518
Hey.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.153
Oh, hi.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.655
Sorry to wake you up, I just,

04:41.657 --> 04:42.923
uh, I was gonna say goodbye.

04:42.925 --> 04:45.458
Oh, you're leaving?

04:45.460 --> 04:48.361
Yeah, uh... you know,
Randall and Kate and I

04:48.363 --> 04:50.297
decided to take a last-minute
trip to the family cabin

04:50.299 --> 04:52.566
for a couple days, sort of, um...

04:52.568 --> 04:54.834
Anyway, I got to go home and pack and...

04:54.836 --> 04:57.014
Speaking of Kate, uh...

04:57.016 --> 04:59.239
what do you suppose we
should tell her about...

04:59.241 --> 05:00.607
about this?

05:00.609 --> 05:02.776
- Probably...
- Yeah, I think, um...

05:02.778 --> 05:06.646
I think, I think we just tell
her that we're falling in love.

05:06.648 --> 05:09.016
- Huh?
- She'll be happy for us.

05:11.987 --> 05:14.187
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.890
- Okay, all right, you got me.
- Your face.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.959
No, I-I thought you were

05:18.961 --> 05:21.728
s-serious... you got,
you're, that's good.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.730
- I'm not crazy, Kevin.
- Okay.

05:23.732 --> 05:25.398
We haven't even been on a date yet.

05:25.400 --> 05:30.170
Plus, what we did
is... pretty messed up.

05:30.172 --> 05:31.671
Best friend and brother hooking up

05:31.673 --> 05:34.941
is a huge violation of lady code.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.476
Yeah, I agree.

05:36.478 --> 05:38.878
Kate doesn't need to
know this ever happened.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.115
No. No.

05:42.117 --> 05:45.583
Okay, so, start with this milk
in the fridge first, right?

05:45.585 --> 05:47.320
And then, move to the
ones in the freezer.

05:47.322 --> 05:48.655
Okay.

05:48.657 --> 05:51.310
Okay, and then, also, um, this is

05:51.312 --> 05:53.516
a list of all the solid foods
that we know that he's not

05:53.518 --> 05:55.675
- allergic to.
- Right, got it.

05:55.677 --> 05:57.664
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, yeah, I got it.

05:57.666 --> 05:59.332
Okay.

05:59.334 --> 06:02.268
Oh.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.205
- Oh, that's Kevin... he's here.
- Okay.

06:05.207 --> 06:07.374
Um, okay, so, so you know

06:07.376 --> 06:09.576
- that the service sucks in the cabin.
- Yeah.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.612
But we have that Wi-Fi
thingy, so if you could just,

06:12.614 --> 06:15.348
just text, FaceTime, like, a lot.

06:15.350 --> 06:17.517
- Will do, will do.
- A lot. Okay.

06:17.519 --> 06:20.294
- Okay, buddy.
- Okay, Jack...

06:20.296 --> 06:23.823
- Come here, Mama's going.
- Okay.

06:23.825 --> 06:26.793
Okay. Oh, no, no, no...

06:26.795 --> 06:28.426
- It's okay.
- Are you sure that I shouldn't

06:28.428 --> 06:29.557
just take him with me?

06:29.559 --> 06:32.098
I mean, you've never been
alone with him overnight.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.401
Kate...

06:34.403 --> 06:37.570
Jack and I are gonna be just fine.

06:37.572 --> 06:39.707
We are all gonna be just fine.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.310
Okay, bubby.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.479
- Okay.
- I love you and I'm gonna see you really soon.

06:46.481 --> 06:48.214
I love you.

06:48.216 --> 06:49.282
Okay, all right.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.450
Okay, Audie?

06:50.452 --> 06:52.585
I will see you soon, too, okay?

06:52.587 --> 06:54.354
- Okay.
- Keep an eye on them.

06:54.356 --> 06:55.522
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:55.524 --> 06:56.589
Okay...

06:56.591 --> 06:57.691
All right, say bye-bye!

06:57.693 --> 07:00.193
Oh, yeah.

07:01.863 --> 07:04.298
Hey, well...

07:06.068 --> 07:08.502
Looks like it's just me and you, kid.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:18.394 --> 07:19.827
Oh, my God.

07:19.829 --> 07:21.529
Just pick something to bury.

07:21.531 --> 07:23.883
This is important, Kevin.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.720
It has to be able to
withstand the test of time.

07:26.722 --> 07:29.222
And I really don't

07:29.224 --> 07:31.925
want to make the wrong choice.

07:42.537 --> 07:43.636
There they are!

07:43.638 --> 07:45.305
- Hey-oh!
- Hi!

07:45.307 --> 07:48.341
Welcome to the Pearson
family cabin, where the fire

07:48.343 --> 07:51.129
is roaring, the herbal tea is a-brewing,

07:51.131 --> 07:53.022
and the puzzle is a-piecing.

07:53.024 --> 07:55.547
Wow, you seem a lot better
than I thought you'd be.

07:55.549 --> 07:58.952
You know, yesterday on the
phone you, uh, seemed a little...

07:58.954 --> 08:01.538
Wait, Randall, you
really messed up your hand.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.089
- Uh, I know.
- Oh, nice.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.724
I was in the thick of it, but, uh,

08:04.726 --> 08:07.794
- I'm doing much better now.
- That makes one of us.

08:07.796 --> 08:10.363
How you guys doing? You want
to talk about your stuff?

08:10.365 --> 08:11.801
- No.
- No, not really.

08:11.803 --> 08:13.256
We watched six hours of John Wick

08:13.258 --> 08:15.712
on the airplane so I wouldn't have
to think about my engaged ex-wife,

08:15.714 --> 08:17.262
and she wouldn't have to think about

08:17.264 --> 08:19.425
the fact that Toby hates
their son because he's blind.

08:19.427 --> 08:21.166
- Hey!
- Whoa.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.634
Sorry.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.403
Yeah.

08:24.405 --> 08:26.128
Oh, my God.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.524
- Hmm?
- I forgot that Dad turned

08:28.526 --> 08:31.109
- this old photo into a puzzle.
- Yeah.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.813
Care to join me in 520 pieces
of pure meditative bliss?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.538
Oh, I'm gonna skip that.

08:36.539 --> 08:38.984
I'm gonna stick to the movies...
you know, turn off the brain?

08:38.986 --> 08:42.354
What do we got here? We got,
uh, White Fang, right?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.435
Or... Free Willy.

08:44.437 --> 08:46.237
- Free Willy.
- Man, the '90s

08:46.239 --> 08:50.475
had a real thing for "white boy
befriends exotic animal" movies.

08:50.477 --> 08:53.077
- Um...
- Aw, great, okay, uh...

08:53.079 --> 08:55.113
I'll go check the circuit breaker.

08:55.115 --> 08:57.195
I swear to God, if I'm not
watching a troubled youth

08:57.197 --> 08:59.898
fall in love with an
orca in 15 minutes...

09:05.025 --> 09:07.892
Hey, you didn't say anything
to him about Mom, did you?

09:07.894 --> 09:09.360
No, of course not.

09:09.362 --> 09:11.162
And I promised her that I wouldn't.

09:11.164 --> 09:14.566
She's still really worried
about, you know,

09:14.568 --> 09:16.734
- him staying sober, so...
- Yeah.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.303
I can't say that I blame her.

09:18.305 --> 09:20.538
I mean, this stuff that's
going on with Sophie?

09:20.540 --> 09:24.142
I mean, he barely said one
word the entire plane ride.

09:24.144 --> 09:26.144
Please tell me there's...

09:26.146 --> 09:27.512
- Nope.
- No.

09:27.514 --> 09:30.539
No power. Okay, well, it's
not the circuit breaker.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.724
The wind's kind of picked
up out there, you know?

09:32.726 --> 09:33.985
It might've knocked out a few lines.

09:33.987 --> 09:35.320
Think a storm's coming in.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.366
Um... does that mean no Wi-Fi?

09:39.368 --> 09:40.396
No Wi-Fi.

09:40.398 --> 09:42.427
No, I have to be able
to talk to Toby and Jack.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.719
I don't have a signal.

09:44.721 --> 09:47.666
I don't, I don't have a...
We should head to town.

09:47.668 --> 09:49.200
There's probably cell service there.

09:49.202 --> 09:51.369
- Okay, um...
- And we can pick up supplies... flashlight, batteries,

09:51.371 --> 09:53.888
- non-perishables.
- He says "non-perishables".

09:53.890 --> 09:55.345
Randall, we're gonna
be here for the weekend.

09:55.347 --> 09:56.808
- Let's just chill for a little...
- No, Kev, I need to check

09:56.810 --> 09:58.176
my security cameras, come on.

09:58.178 --> 09:59.445
Okay.

10:01.348 --> 10:02.580
Okay.

10:08.888 --> 10:10.356
Damn it.

10:13.326 --> 10:15.193
What is this?

10:15.195 --> 10:16.728
Hi.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.696
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Sorry,

10:18.698 --> 10:20.365
I'm-I'm just trying
to get to my daughter.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.533
She's staying, uh, in a cabin

10:22.535 --> 10:24.736
- about 20 miles north of here.
- Uh...

10:24.738 --> 10:26.771
yeah, can't get there
tonight, I'm afraid.

10:26.773 --> 10:29.307
Huge tree went down,
the whole road is closed.

10:29.309 --> 10:31.609
There's a motel couple miles back.

10:31.611 --> 10:34.145
Should be clear in the morning.

10:34.147 --> 10:36.914
- Good night.
- In the morning... Okay.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.752
It'll be okay. I'm-I'm
sure she's fine, Mom.

10:43.723 --> 10:45.724
Oh, God.

10:52.065 --> 10:56.434
- This place is pretty great.
- Yeah.

10:56.436 --> 11:00.905
Maybe one day we'll have
a cabin like this, hmm?

11:00.907 --> 11:04.275
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Yeah.

11:04.277 --> 11:07.145
Coffee's ready. Could you get
a couple mugs from the cabinet?

11:07.147 --> 11:08.781
Mm-hmm.

11:36.643 --> 11:39.844
Um, could y...

11:39.846 --> 11:42.513
could you actually
just-just get another mug?

11:42.515 --> 11:45.416
Are you serious?

11:45.418 --> 11:47.652
Yeah, it's just, um,

11:47.654 --> 11:50.221
he's the only one that's ever used that.

11:50.223 --> 11:51.489
Oh.

11:51.491 --> 11:55.693
Okay, well, then I
better be careful. Uh-oh!

11:55.695 --> 11:58.605
- Marc! Marc, why? It's not funny.
- Whoa. It's slippery.

11:58.607 --> 11:59.757
- Oh, my God.
- Don't...

11:59.759 --> 12:03.267
Can you just get another mug, please?

12:08.442 --> 12:10.932
Aw, crap.

12:10.934 --> 12:13.905
It totally slipped. I'm so sorry.

12:13.907 --> 12:17.455
- What the hell, Marc?
- Kate, I just said it was an accident.

12:17.457 --> 12:18.680
You need to relax.

12:18.682 --> 12:20.551
Oh, yeah, great, great. Thanks.

12:20.553 --> 12:23.021
Life advice from an unemployed
record store cashier.

12:24.057 --> 12:26.024
Shut up.

12:29.262 --> 12:31.346
I'm getting wood for the fire.

12:31.348 --> 12:33.237
Oh, great, so now we
can make some s'mores

12:33.239 --> 12:35.040
and you can stuff your face.

12:38.438 --> 12:40.471
Hey, babe. How's it going?

12:40.473 --> 12:42.206
All's well on the home front.

12:42.208 --> 12:45.243
Jack is taking bottles
down like a champ,

12:45.245 --> 12:49.247
and now he's having some
well-earned playpen time.

12:49.249 --> 12:52.418
Great. Um, are you having any fun?

12:54.454 --> 12:56.488
Kate, give me a chance, would you?

12:58.525 --> 13:00.525
You're right. I'm sorry, you're right.

13:00.527 --> 13:02.927
Hey, babe, uh, it's me.

13:02.929 --> 13:05.863
Power went out at the
cabin, so there's no Wi-Fi.

13:05.865 --> 13:08.866
Um, I'm at a market,

13:08.868 --> 13:12.136
but the service here is too
weak for the cameras to load,

13:12.138 --> 13:14.238
so would you please
check the security cameras

13:14.240 --> 13:17.475
when you get a chance? Uh, please?

13:17.477 --> 13:21.078
Okay, call me back. Miss you.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.190
This is crazy... "100
hottest Hollywood hunks"

13:23.192 --> 13:24.265
and I'm not on the list?

13:24.267 --> 13:25.917
What planet are we living on

13:25.919 --> 13:29.188
where Elijah Wood is
hotter than I am? Anyway...

13:30.723 --> 13:32.156
Why is your face doing that?

13:32.158 --> 13:35.693
Because I just listened
to my voice mails.

13:35.695 --> 13:37.361
And?

13:37.363 --> 13:40.598
And, um, well...

13:40.600 --> 13:43.367
Hey, Kate, it's Madison.

13:43.369 --> 13:44.569
Call me.

13:44.571 --> 13:46.137
It's important.

13:46.139 --> 13:48.105
Huh.

13:48.107 --> 13:50.441
- Weird.
- Wonder what the hell that's all about.

13:50.443 --> 13:51.943
- Do you?
- Yeah.

13:51.945 --> 13:55.531
- What about this one?
- Hi, me again.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.691
Just wanted to say no
need to call me back.

13:57.693 --> 13:59.083
This isn't something

13:59.085 --> 14:01.118
I want to discuss over the phone.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.454
- Hmm.
- Oh, God, that could be anything.

14:03.456 --> 14:05.046
- No, you know, sh...
- I don't know.

14:05.048 --> 14:07.358
- Madison again.
- Oh, God, there's a third one.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.993
I'm just gonna rip the Band-Aid off

14:08.995 --> 14:13.030
'cause the guilt is eating
me alive. I slept with Kevin.

14:13.032 --> 14:15.066
Your brother, Kevin.

14:15.068 --> 14:16.601
Duh, you know who Kevin is.

14:16.603 --> 14:18.983
I am really sorry, Kate.

14:18.985 --> 14:22.440
It was a stupid, selfish thing to do.

14:22.442 --> 14:24.876
I really hope you don't hate me.

14:24.878 --> 14:27.079
Okay. Call me.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.782
Listen, I can explain that.

14:31.784 --> 14:36.020
Okay, explain. Explain
why you, famous person

14:36.022 --> 14:38.956
who could sleep with literally
any woman in the country,

14:38.958 --> 14:41.659
decides to sleep with my closest friend.

14:41.661 --> 14:45.863
I'm an idiot, okay? I
made a mistake. I'm sorry.

14:45.865 --> 14:49.368
The day that I had
with Sophie, I just...

14:50.459 --> 14:52.815
Shouldn't I get some credit
for not sleeping with Sophie?

14:52.817 --> 14:54.539
- Credit?
- Okay, that came out wrong.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.741
Hey, uh, guys, sorry, I
got to get back to Philly.

14:56.743 --> 14:57.975
Why? What happened?

14:57.977 --> 14:59.844
Uh, nothing, but I haven't
been able to reach Beth

14:59.846 --> 15:02.079
for a while now, and it's...

15:02.081 --> 15:04.582
You've got to get back to Philly
because you haven't been able

15:04.584 --> 15:07.518
to-to reach Beth in a few hours,
even though she's in D.C.?

15:07.520 --> 15:10.488
False alarm, Beth and
the girls are okay.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.857
They were just in a movie.

15:12.859 --> 15:15.059
- Good.
- Okay.

15:15.061 --> 15:17.996
Um, let's pay for this stuff
and get back to the cabin.

15:24.042 --> 15:27.050
Okay, buddy. Yeah.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.520
Here-here comes lunch.

15:29.522 --> 15:33.190
Breakfast for lunch, huh?

15:33.192 --> 15:35.025
All right, here it comes.

15:35.027 --> 15:37.861
Huevos a la Toby.

15:37.863 --> 15:40.297
There you go, there you go.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.067
Look at us, buddy, huh?

15:44.069 --> 15:47.871
Couple of bros breaking bread.

15:47.873 --> 15:51.275
First, eggs. Someday, beers.

15:51.277 --> 15:55.145
Or... I'm more of a daiquiri man myself.

15:55.147 --> 15:58.048
Yeah, there you go. You got it.

15:58.050 --> 16:00.985
Hey, there you go. Right here.

16:02.853 --> 16:04.687
Yeah, good. There you go.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.525
There you go.

16:08.527 --> 16:11.395
Hey.

16:11.397 --> 16:13.964
Hey, buddy.

16:13.966 --> 16:17.000
Are you okay?

16:17.002 --> 16:19.137
Jack, are you choking?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.406
Jack.

16:22.408 --> 16:26.577
Okay, all right. Okay. Here we go. Hey.

16:26.579 --> 16:29.813
C-Come on, come here, come here,
come here, come here, come here.

16:29.815 --> 16:32.716
Okay, buddy.

16:32.718 --> 16:35.053
Oh, God. Uh...

16:38.881 --> 16:40.148
Okay. Uh...

16:44.129 --> 16:45.629
Five.

16:45.631 --> 16:48.933
Okay. Oh, Jack?

16:50.736 --> 16:52.636
One, two,

16:52.638 --> 16:55.072
three, four...

16:55.074 --> 16:57.474
Okay, okay.

16:59.178 --> 17:03.280
Oh, good, good, good, good,
good, good, good. Oh...

17:03.282 --> 17:04.731
All right.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:20.933 --> 17:22.967
Marc.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.510
Marc!

17:28.512 --> 17:30.034
Come on,

17:30.036 --> 17:31.900
it's freezing. Please, open the door.

17:31.902 --> 17:34.177
This isn't funny.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.247
It's really coming down

17:39.249 --> 17:41.116
- out there.
- Yeah.

17:42.688 --> 17:45.389
Kate, I'm kind of worried about Randall.

17:45.391 --> 17:47.057
Me, too.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.428
- Guys?
- Hey.

17:51.430 --> 17:52.630
Hey.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.634
What's up?

18:05.177 --> 18:06.677
We're worried about you.

18:06.679 --> 18:08.111
Yeah.

18:08.113 --> 18:10.914
- It just seems like...
- You're sort of

18:10.916 --> 18:12.326
- primed for a meltdown.
- Wh...

18:12.328 --> 18:14.551
- Excuse me?
- Way to ease into it.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.153
Well, this is how I ease.

18:16.155 --> 18:18.255
Oh, like you eased into Madison's pants?

18:18.257 --> 18:21.091
What's that supposed to mean?

18:21.093 --> 18:22.854
OMG, did you sleep with Madison?

18:22.856 --> 18:24.613
Listen, here's what we're
gonna do, we're just gonna focus

18:24.615 --> 18:27.016
- on you right now, okay?
- Oh.

18:29.459 --> 18:32.650
Listen, uh,

18:32.652 --> 18:35.888
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm fine, okay?

18:38.390 --> 18:41.681
If anything, I might be a
little exhausted, all right?

18:41.683 --> 18:44.206
Between the break-in and the mugging,

18:44.208 --> 18:48.043
and the trip to L.A., it's
just, uh, it's been a lot.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.646
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.250
You were in L.A.?

18:55.252 --> 18:56.585
What?

18:56.587 --> 18:58.787
The L.A. flight, when was that?

18:58.789 --> 19:02.057
That was a few days
ago. It was a work trip.

19:02.059 --> 19:04.026
- Oh.
- Yeah.

19:04.028 --> 19:06.895
To L... I thought you said
your work trip was to...

19:06.897 --> 19:09.493
- you said Boston for work.
- Right. No. I did.

19:09.495 --> 19:11.166
- It was a different trip.
- Oh.

19:11.168 --> 19:12.434
- Yeah.
- Different trip?

19:12.436 --> 19:14.803
- Yeah.
- Different trip to L.A.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.538
You come to L.A., you don't,
you don't come see us?

19:16.540 --> 19:18.107
It was super fast, man, just in and out.

19:18.109 --> 19:19.843
- In and out.
- Yeah.

19:28.486 --> 19:30.487
Did you know he was in L.A.?

19:33.190 --> 19:36.760
- Hmm?
- Yes.

19:38.462 --> 19:40.296
Oh.

19:41.966 --> 19:44.166
What's going on?

19:44.168 --> 19:45.902
Guys?

19:49.306 --> 19:51.106
Um...

19:51.108 --> 19:54.810
- We have to tell you something.
- Okay.

19:54.812 --> 19:57.047
It's about Mom.

20:04.215 --> 20:05.912
Have you figured out what you're putting

20:05.914 --> 20:08.915
in your time capsule yet?
'Cause the clock is ticking.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.319
No, not yet. You?

20:12.321 --> 20:15.188
- Almost. I have it narrowed down to my...
- Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

20:15.190 --> 20:17.023
Don't give it away.

20:17.025 --> 20:19.693
- Really?
- I'll find out in five years.

20:19.695 --> 20:22.529
What's this?

20:22.531 --> 20:25.532
Just daydreaming.

20:25.534 --> 20:26.900
You know, thinking about building us

20:26.902 --> 20:29.269
a bigger place out here.

20:29.271 --> 20:33.859
More room for the kids, grandkids.

20:33.861 --> 20:36.784
Maybe, uh, maybe up on that hill

20:36.786 --> 20:39.412
right there.

20:39.414 --> 20:42.615
Maybe with a glass door,

20:42.617 --> 20:44.474
floor-to-ceiling windows,

20:44.476 --> 20:46.987
let in all this nature. I mean,

20:46.989 --> 20:50.457
Bec, look at this place.
This is all ours.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.727
You know?

20:53.729 --> 20:56.930
Babe, we just bought the cabin.

20:56.932 --> 20:59.366
I know we-we can't swing it.

20:59.368 --> 21:01.690
I mean, considering how tough it was

21:01.692 --> 21:03.971
to even afford this place, but...

21:04.989 --> 21:07.423
... I don't know.

21:09.378 --> 21:12.579
Jack, if you say you're
gonna build us that house,

21:12.581 --> 21:16.416
I believe you're gonna
build us that house.

21:16.418 --> 21:20.053
And a glass door is perfect.

21:20.055 --> 21:21.788
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

21:36.238 --> 21:38.738
Hey. Come here.

21:38.740 --> 21:41.608
Listen up. We are not here
to embarrass your sister

21:41.610 --> 21:43.610
or make a scene. Okay?

21:43.612 --> 21:46.112
We are here because we were
worried about the storm.

21:46.114 --> 21:48.516
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

22:01.163 --> 22:03.863
Uh, what-what are you guys doing here?

22:03.865 --> 22:08.034
We were, we were really worried
about the storm. You know? We...

22:08.036 --> 22:12.138
It seemed bad and we didn't know
if Marc had snow tires and...

22:12.140 --> 22:15.976
We just wanted to make sure
you were safe. That's all.

22:18.313 --> 22:20.448
Well, you're just in time for breakfast.

22:21.683 --> 22:22.917
Okay.

22:24.019 --> 22:26.019
♪ But before it's closing time... ♪

22:26.021 --> 22:27.254
Hey.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.212
Hey. Um...

22:29.214 --> 22:30.290
Hi.

22:30.292 --> 22:33.726
Oh. Whoa.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.762
We got the whole cavalry, huh?

22:35.764 --> 22:37.897
Yeah, they, um, they
were worried about us

22:37.899 --> 22:39.099
because of the storm.

22:39.101 --> 22:41.334
- Mm. Got it.
- So...

22:41.336 --> 22:42.969
All right.

22:42.971 --> 22:45.872
Um, well, I hope you
like pancakes, Pearsons.

22:45.874 --> 22:48.475
- Huh? Have a seat.
- We love pancakes.

22:48.477 --> 22:49.986
- Perfect.
- Right?

22:49.988 --> 22:51.010
Mm-hmm.

22:51.012 --> 22:54.014
- Go ahead, sit down. Go on. Yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

22:54.972 --> 22:57.662
Okay, what's going on?

22:57.664 --> 22:59.198
What's-what's going on with Mom?

23:01.323 --> 23:02.956
Guys, what the hell's going on with Mom?

23:02.958 --> 23:04.507
- Somebody say something.
- All right, all right, all right...

23:04.509 --> 23:06.759
It's, um...

23:06.761 --> 23:11.432
Mom is suffering from
cognitive impairment.

23:13.768 --> 23:17.080
And it's too early to-to
see how it's gonna progress.

23:17.082 --> 23:21.208
But we'll know more once we get
her MRI results back next week.

23:25.019 --> 23:26.419
MRI...

23:32.621 --> 23:36.189
I don't think... Uh, no. I...
'Cause I was with her, uh,

23:36.191 --> 23:38.205
a couple weeks ago. She was great.

23:38.207 --> 23:40.927
- She was fine.
- Her symptoms are really subtle right now,

23:40.929 --> 23:42.362
but I noticed them.

23:42.364 --> 23:44.898
Oh. And I didn't?

23:44.900 --> 23:46.834
I didn't say that, Kev.

23:50.885 --> 23:52.908
Randall, are we talking
about Alzheimer's here?

23:52.910 --> 23:54.708
Possibly.

24:00.415 --> 24:02.415
Uh, well...

24:02.417 --> 24:05.818
Okay. So, uh, you know, we...

24:05.820 --> 24:07.387
I'll get her in to a specialist.

24:07.389 --> 24:09.171
You know, I can find
her the best doctors...

24:09.173 --> 24:10.948
I already did that, Kev.

24:12.127 --> 24:14.895
That's why I was in L.A.

24:17.566 --> 24:20.434
Oh.

24:24.806 --> 24:27.540
Randall, you came to L.A.,
the city that I live in,

24:27.542 --> 24:29.643
and you took our mother to a specialist,

24:29.645 --> 24:30.810
and you did it behind my back?

24:30.812 --> 24:32.912
Mom asked me not to tell you guys.

24:32.914 --> 24:35.114
She didn't want to add any
more stress to your plates.

24:35.116 --> 24:36.583
Well, then, how... then how do you know?

24:36.585 --> 24:38.575
If we're not supposed to
know, how do you know, then?

24:38.577 --> 24:41.167
- She just told me, like, a few days ago.
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.169 --> 24:43.022
I'm sure she was gonna
tell you soon, too.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.524
So, Mom didn't think I
could handle it, right?

24:44.526 --> 24:46.813
"Kevin can't handle it", so
you guys just agreed with her?

24:46.815 --> 24:48.428
We were just trying to honor her wishes.

24:48.430 --> 24:51.364
- You honoring her wishes, Randall?
- That's all.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.367
That's great.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.078
- Come on, man.
- Just give me a minute!

25:06.499 --> 25:09.077
So? Marc's a pretty good cook, right?

25:09.079 --> 25:11.659
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Breakfast is his specialty.

25:11.661 --> 25:14.518
He, um, he makes this Western omelet

25:14.520 --> 25:15.919
- that's-that's so good.
- Mmm. The Western omelet.

25:15.921 --> 25:18.255
- It has...
- Why is it freezing in here?

25:18.257 --> 25:19.513
Oh, yeah, I know.

25:19.515 --> 25:21.625
We, um, we didn't keep
the fire going last night

25:21.627 --> 25:24.094
'cause I forgot how
cold it gets up here.

25:24.096 --> 25:26.186
It was stupid of me.

25:26.188 --> 25:28.600
But it's freezing now, so
I sh-should've done that.

25:34.589 --> 25:36.646
The window's broken.

25:36.648 --> 25:38.115
What?

25:39.249 --> 25:40.772
Did you guys know about this?

25:40.774 --> 25:43.831
No, I-I didn't see it. But th...

25:43.833 --> 25:46.920
I guess that explains
why it's freezing in here.

25:46.922 --> 25:49.156
If you guys didn't notice the window,

25:49.158 --> 25:51.158
why is there no broken
glass on the floor?

25:51.160 --> 25:52.960
Uh...

25:52.962 --> 25:56.064
Okay, calm down, Encyclopedia Brown.

25:57.169 --> 25:58.569
What?

26:00.436 --> 26:02.703
Why do you have gloves on?

26:02.705 --> 26:05.506
Because it's cold in here.

26:05.508 --> 26:07.441
Take them off.

26:07.443 --> 26:09.143
What are you talking about?

26:10.980 --> 26:12.547
Kate, take them off.

26:16.785 --> 26:20.087
God, okay, fine. Just...

26:20.089 --> 26:21.788
It's not a big... It's just...

26:21.790 --> 26:23.690
Oh, God. Kate.

26:23.692 --> 26:25.826
No, Mom, it's really not a...

26:25.828 --> 26:27.805
- What happened?
- I didn't even want you guys

26:27.807 --> 26:30.397
to notice because it's... it's actually

26:30.399 --> 26:33.166
a super embarrassing
story. Okay, Marc and I...

26:33.168 --> 26:35.736
We locked ourselves out last night.

26:35.738 --> 26:38.405
We were freezing and we had
to get in, so I broke the glass

26:38.407 --> 26:41.942
and it cut my hand and I'll pay
for the repair of the window.

26:41.944 --> 26:44.611
What the hell happened last night, Marc?

26:44.613 --> 26:46.971
- Yeah...
- What? I told you...

26:46.973 --> 26:48.982
Okay. Uh... Wait.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.651
Okay.

26:50.653 --> 26:53.287
We had a stupid fight.

26:53.289 --> 26:55.489
Kate then went out to get some firewood

26:55.491 --> 26:59.734
and I locked her out for a
minute because I was pissed.

26:59.736 --> 27:01.194
And I was about to unlock it,

27:01.196 --> 27:02.629
and I was about to let her back in,

27:02.631 --> 27:05.493
but before I could, she freaked out

27:05.495 --> 27:08.236
and she smashed the window
and then she cut her hand.

27:09.983 --> 27:11.617
It was freezing outside.

27:12.942 --> 27:14.943
How long were you out there?

27:17.246 --> 27:18.413
Marc?

27:21.617 --> 27:22.817
Marc!

27:25.487 --> 27:26.688
Marc!

27:54.717 --> 27:56.540
Let's go outside.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.574
No, no, no, no.

27:57.576 --> 27:58.819
- Why?
- I'm about to beat the crap

27:58.821 --> 28:00.621
- out of you, Marc. That's why.
- No. Kevin, Kevin.

28:00.623 --> 28:02.456
- This isn't funny. Yeah.
- No... Both of you.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.935
- Let's go! Let's go outside!
- Hey, relax! Relax!

28:04.937 --> 28:07.171
Okay?

28:08.592 --> 28:10.769
You, get the hell out of my house.

28:10.771 --> 28:13.010
Mom...

28:13.012 --> 28:16.448
Get the hell out of my house.

28:18.674 --> 28:20.407
Today is the last day

28:20.409 --> 28:22.276
you're ever gonna see my daughter, Marc.

28:24.413 --> 28:28.916
You have two minutes. Get
your stuff and get out of here.

28:46.835 --> 28:49.202
Come here, my love. Come here, Bug.

28:49.204 --> 28:52.673
Sweetheart. My sweet Bug.

28:52.675 --> 28:54.808
He said he loved me.

28:54.810 --> 28:56.576
Oh, I know. I bet he did.

28:56.578 --> 28:58.146
I bet he did.

29:00.516 --> 29:02.472
Okay, I haven't found any damage

29:02.474 --> 29:05.652
to the airway and he seems
to be fully responsive.

29:05.654 --> 29:07.587
I think we got a healthy baby here.

29:07.589 --> 29:10.882
Are you sure? Because
he was really choking,

29:10.884 --> 29:12.059
for, like, a long time.

29:12.061 --> 29:13.794
20, 30 seconds before he spit it out.

29:13.796 --> 29:17.110
I... I pounded on his back pretty hard.

29:17.112 --> 29:19.666
He's fine, Toby.

29:19.668 --> 29:21.168
I promise.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.203
You did the exact right thing.

29:23.205 --> 29:25.731
I'll see you next week
for your favorite...

29:25.733 --> 29:27.908
mm, more vaccines.

29:27.910 --> 29:29.910
Yeah. Yeah.

29:29.912 --> 29:32.547
You're lucky to have
such a great dad, Jack.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.160
You think Kevin's okay?

29:47.162 --> 29:51.398
Yeah. I think he probably
just needed some air.

29:52.901 --> 29:56.002
Speaking of Kev, I
think this is his nipple.

29:56.004 --> 29:58.672
All right. Oh, wait a minute.

29:58.674 --> 30:00.073
Hold on.

30:00.075 --> 30:04.278
Yes. This completes Mom's arm.

30:10.953 --> 30:13.354
You know, she tried so hard with me.

30:15.190 --> 30:18.826
And I just could never give her a break.

30:22.072 --> 30:24.940
And now that we're-we're finally good...

30:27.202 --> 30:29.070
... this is happening.

30:34.110 --> 30:37.200
It must have been really hard
to be the only person who knew

30:37.202 --> 30:38.780
what was going on with Mom.

30:41.083 --> 30:44.017
But you know that you don't have
to take this on alone, right?

30:44.019 --> 30:48.021
I know that I haven't
always been strong,

30:48.023 --> 30:50.423
but I am strong now.

30:50.425 --> 30:53.059
Kevin is strong.

30:53.061 --> 30:57.464
And we're gonna do this together.

30:57.466 --> 30:58.965
Okay.

31:04.039 --> 31:06.439
Okay, really? One piece?

31:06.441 --> 31:08.875
Where is Dad's eye?

31:11.246 --> 31:12.646
Come on.

31:12.648 --> 31:15.499
- What?
- Just... We're going outside.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.020
- Come on.
- Outside?

31:17.022 --> 31:20.587
Come on!

31:33.202 --> 31:35.936
You guys coming to kill me?

31:35.938 --> 31:37.571
No.

31:37.573 --> 31:39.907
We're gonna dig up the time capsule.

31:44.921 --> 31:46.921
Okay.

31:58.652 --> 32:01.153
What a day, huh?

32:08.929 --> 32:11.330
Hey, Jack, I'm gonna introduce you

32:11.332 --> 32:12.764
to something...

32:12.766 --> 32:15.634
very important to me, okay?

32:15.636 --> 32:17.836
This...

32:17.838 --> 32:19.972
is Star Wars.

32:19.974 --> 32:22.207
Now, yes, Star Wars had

32:22.209 --> 32:25.277
some pretty epic visuals.

32:25.279 --> 32:29.748
But it also has some pretty epic audio.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.555
See, this guy Ben Burtt, he designed

32:31.557 --> 32:33.190
all the sounds for the
movie, and pretty much

32:33.192 --> 32:34.758
revolutionized sound design.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.159
So, check it out...

32:36.161 --> 32:39.262
this is Luke Skywalker.

32:39.264 --> 32:40.797
And this is his lightsaber.

32:40.799 --> 32:42.232
When he turns it on, it goes...

32:42.234 --> 32:43.900
Whoa...

32:43.902 --> 32:46.737
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:46.739 --> 32:49.506
And this, this is his trusty droid,

32:49.508 --> 32:51.274
R2-D2, and he goes...

32:55.547 --> 32:57.347
- His friend, C-3PO.
- Oh, hello.

32:59.318 --> 33:01.017
This over here's Princess Leia.

33:01.019 --> 33:04.721
Pretty much the coolest lady
in the history of ladies.

33:04.723 --> 33:06.089
Aside from your mom.

33:06.091 --> 33:08.024
This is Han Solo, he
has the coolest line

33:08.026 --> 33:09.059
in the history of movies.

33:09.061 --> 33:11.094
Princess Leia says, "I love you".

33:11.096 --> 33:12.930
And he says, "I know".

33:14.099 --> 33:16.366
You like it.

33:16.368 --> 33:18.702
You like Star Wars?

33:25.411 --> 33:28.044
- Come on.
- Come on.

33:28.046 --> 33:30.103
My feet started freezing,
like, 20 minutes ago.

33:30.105 --> 33:31.615
Are you sure that
this is the right spot?

33:31.617 --> 33:32.816
I feel something.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.720
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

33:36.722 --> 33:37.821
- Uh-oh!
- There's something.

33:37.823 --> 33:39.389
Come on.

33:41.927 --> 33:44.027
- All right, all right, all right.
- All right, here we go.

33:44.029 --> 33:46.097
Yes!

33:48.142 --> 33:49.431
Wow.

33:49.433 --> 33:51.434
- Look at that.
- Let me see, let me see.

33:53.472 --> 33:54.924
Well, Kev, I think this one's yours.

33:54.926 --> 33:55.960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:57.142 --> 33:59.242
Let's see.

33:59.244 --> 34:01.278
Wow...

34:01.280 --> 34:03.847
Look at that.

34:03.849 --> 34:06.550
Even back then.

34:06.552 --> 34:08.185
After all this time.

34:08.187 --> 34:09.719
Wait.

34:09.721 --> 34:11.254
I think this was... this one's mine!

34:11.255 --> 34:12.856
- I got you.
- Oh!

34:12.858 --> 34:17.260
Gosh, it was that game
MASH I used to love to play.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.228
You know, where you find out
what house you're gonna live in,

34:19.231 --> 34:20.630
how many kids you're gonna have,

34:20.632 --> 34:22.431
who you're gonna marry, so...

34:22.434 --> 34:23.966
marry Joey Lawrence.

34:23.967 --> 34:26.503
Live in a mansion,
have a boy and a girl.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.505
And live happily ever after.

34:33.145 --> 34:35.145
Hey.

34:35.147 --> 34:37.377
Joey Lawrence ain't
got nothing on Tobias.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.935
Can you hold that for me?

34:38.937 --> 34:40.617
Yeah.

34:40.619 --> 34:43.487
Well, who's the only dork
who put his name on the bag?

34:43.489 --> 34:45.054
Cute!

34:45.056 --> 34:47.225
All right, so that...

34:51.299 --> 34:53.029
What is it?

34:53.031 --> 34:54.264
- Ta-da.
- What?!

34:54.266 --> 34:55.899
The missing puzzle piece?

34:55.900 --> 34:57.467
- Uh-huh.
- What?

34:57.469 --> 34:59.036
Wait, how did you even choose that?

35:00.239 --> 35:01.838
I didn't.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.840
Hey, guys.

35:03.842 --> 35:06.743
It's capsule time, let's go.

35:06.745 --> 35:08.678
I can't do it.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.280
I can't decide.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.188
I'm not gonna put anything in it.

35:12.190 --> 35:14.518
I'd rather bury it with nothing in it

35:14.520 --> 35:16.595
than with something stupid
that I'm gonna regret.

35:16.597 --> 35:19.013
Randall, chill.

35:22.227 --> 35:23.527
Hey, Randall?

35:23.529 --> 35:24.661
What?!

35:24.663 --> 35:27.430
Here, wait.

35:27.432 --> 35:28.965
Here.

35:28.967 --> 35:30.534
This.

35:30.536 --> 35:32.469
- No, won't people miss it?
- No way.

35:32.471 --> 35:34.905
Nobody wants to do this
stupid puzzle except you.

35:34.907 --> 35:37.073
And this way, when we dig it up,

35:37.075 --> 35:38.508
everyone will be glad we found it.

35:38.510 --> 35:40.243
It's perfect.

35:40.245 --> 35:42.178
I promise.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.549
Come on.

35:46.785 --> 35:49.152
It was just a fun,

35:49.154 --> 35:51.521
silly time capsule, bro.

35:51.523 --> 35:53.391
And I choked.

35:55.193 --> 35:58.061
I've been anxious for so long...

35:58.063 --> 35:59.763
and...

35:59.765 --> 36:01.398
I don't get better.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.467
Not really.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.637
The truth is...

36:07.639 --> 36:11.274
as soon as I tackled
that mugger, I had him.

36:11.276 --> 36:13.277
I didn't have to hit him.

36:14.646 --> 36:17.280
I wanted to.

36:17.282 --> 36:19.883
I wanted to let out every
bad feeling that's been

36:19.885 --> 36:23.854
pent up inside of me
for such a long time.

36:28.026 --> 36:31.362
Beth thinks I should see a therapist.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.198
Maybe you should.

36:39.571 --> 36:41.605
Here.

36:41.607 --> 36:42.839
No, wait.

36:42.841 --> 36:44.841
- Hmm?
- There's two more in here, is it...

36:44.843 --> 36:46.480
- Mom and Dad?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:46.482 --> 36:47.838
Take one.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.873
Okay.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.351
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
that's one of those sketches

36:54.353 --> 36:55.852
Dad used to draw, remember?

36:55.854 --> 36:57.887
Uh, remember he was
gonna build a home up here

36:57.889 --> 36:59.756
for-for him and Mom, remember that?

36:59.758 --> 37:01.942
- Yeah!
- Wow.

37:01.944 --> 37:04.612
I wonder what Mom left, let me see.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.702
Mom left a mixtape?

37:13.576 --> 37:16.333
Okay, Mom.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.902
What have you got for us?

37:19.244 --> 37:21.244
Hey, guys.

37:21.246 --> 37:22.812
It's me, your dad.

37:22.814 --> 37:25.048
Holy crap.

37:25.050 --> 37:29.058
It's 1993 and you're all in
your rooms here at the cabin,

37:29.060 --> 37:30.922
trying to figure out just what

37:30.924 --> 37:34.718
you're gonna put inside the capsule.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.177
To, uh, refresh your memories:

37:37.179 --> 37:40.423
Kevin wishes he was seeing Jurassic Park

37:40.425 --> 37:42.432
- with Sophie right now.
- Yeah.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.801
Uh, my Katie girl

37:44.803 --> 37:47.737
is pouring her heart
into it as per usual.

37:47.739 --> 37:50.073
And, Randall...

37:50.075 --> 37:52.914
Randall is overthinking his every move.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.844
No surprise there, bud.

37:56.982 --> 37:59.282
Anyhow, I have this

37:59.284 --> 38:00.871
crazy idea

38:00.873 --> 38:02.852
to build a bigger house out here

38:02.854 --> 38:05.055
for me and your mom to grow old in.

38:05.057 --> 38:07.921
And your mom busted me

38:07.923 --> 38:09.946
while I was sketching it.

38:09.948 --> 38:11.795
I got embarrassed,

38:11.797 --> 38:14.699
crumpled it up, and
tossed it in the trash.

38:16.201 --> 38:18.635
But then I thought to myself, you know,

38:18.637 --> 38:21.137
your mom believes in me, so...

38:21.139 --> 38:24.274
why shouldn't I believe
in myself, right?

38:24.276 --> 38:26.760
So, I go back outside

38:26.762 --> 38:28.645
to get my crumpled piece of paper

38:28.647 --> 38:31.448
out of the trash to put in
the capsule, but it was gone.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.818
You know, at first,
I thought maybe, uh...

38:34.820 --> 38:37.687
maybe the wind carried it away,

38:37.689 --> 38:41.925
or, uh, a bird who's got
a thing for architecture.

38:41.927 --> 38:45.795
But... but then, I realized

38:45.797 --> 38:49.632
that your mom must've
taken it out of the trash,

38:49.634 --> 38:52.203
so that she could put it in the capsule.

39:04.216 --> 39:07.822
Again, because she
believes in my dreams.

39:10.722 --> 39:14.057
By the time you guys hear
this, you're gonna be teenagers

39:14.059 --> 39:18.161
and probably harder on
us than you already are.

39:18.163 --> 39:21.698
So, let me just remind you

39:21.700 --> 39:25.068
that your mom is the kind of woman

39:25.070 --> 39:27.337
who buries a crappy doodle

39:27.339 --> 39:30.106
because when it comes to
the people that she loves,

39:30.108 --> 39:33.109
she does not mess around.

39:33.111 --> 39:35.812
And, Bec, if you're hearing this,

39:35.814 --> 39:38.948
and I've grown stupid in middle age,

39:38.950 --> 39:41.484
I don't tell you enough...

39:41.486 --> 39:44.187
damn, do I love you.

39:45.590 --> 39:49.225
Aw, man. This is gonna be really
embarrassing if it actually

39:49.227 --> 39:51.861
was a bird who stole my
crappy doodle and, uh,

39:51.863 --> 39:55.064
it never made it into
the capsule, so, uh,

39:55.066 --> 39:56.900
yeah, okay.

40:14.136 --> 40:16.126
Hey.

40:16.128 --> 40:18.518
Gonna be all right.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.021
Yeah.

40:32.971 --> 40:35.138
- All right?
- Okay.

40:35.140 --> 40:37.006
Take care of yourself, all right?

40:37.008 --> 40:38.341
- All right?
- I will.

40:39.477 --> 40:41.878
- Okay, back to life.
- Yeah.

40:44.482 --> 40:47.784
- I love you.
- I love you.

40:51.189 --> 40:53.056
It sure is beautiful up here, huh?

40:53.058 --> 40:56.659
I can see why Dad wanted
to build that house.

40:59.598 --> 41:00.897
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

41:02.801 --> 41:05.201
- All right. Bye.
- See ya.

41:07.105 --> 41:10.940
- Take it easy, man.
- Yeah, you, too.

41:54.953 --> 41:56.719
- Hey, brother-in-law.
- Hey.

41:56.721 --> 41:58.588
Everybody's in with Rebecca.

41:58.590 --> 41:59.856
Okay.

41:59.858 --> 42:01.925
- Can I help you with the food?
- Sure.
