WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.704
- I can already feel the
change, you know, the climate.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.606
It's just
a feel-good town here.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.244
- Let's hope the altitude will
help the bid prices go higher.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.412
- That's a great concept,

00:11.445 --> 00:12.713
I don't know if it's
gonna work that way.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.748
I think it really depends
what's in the unit.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.317
How do you like
my mountaineer shirt?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.819
You're street by day,

00:18.852 --> 00:21.155
you know, a little cowboy,
and you're a mountain man.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.391
- Did you say
I streak in the day?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.560
- I mean, we used to do that
in the '70s,

00:26.594 --> 00:28.329
but normally, it was at night.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.601
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:33.634 --> 00:35.936
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:35.969 --> 00:37.438
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:37.471 --> 00:39.440
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.774
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.110
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:42.143 --> 00:43.811
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:43.844 --> 00:45.346
- You shut your face.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.515
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.682
- We're back, baby!

00:52.120 --> 00:53.387
- Look at the view!

00:55.022 --> 00:56.424
Ahh.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.859
- Anyways, it's a nice ride
up here.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.894
It gives us time to catch up.
- Yeah.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.296
- You found anything
good lately?

01:02.330 --> 01:03.497
- Yeah, I found some
skateboards.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.598
I've been skateboarding.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.100
Do I look like
Tony Hawk at all?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.736
- With that boy band haircut
you got going on right now?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.672
- You do know there's
only one direction?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.275
- Get out.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.709
- Oh, here we go.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.245
- Chad is a complete dork,

01:17.278 --> 01:19.213
but I'm looking to buy some
stuff today,

01:19.247 --> 01:20.581
and I might need his help.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.582
You want to go halves?

01:21.615 --> 01:24.152
- Well, can you lend
me some cash?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.519
- No.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.487
Yeah.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.955
- I love it.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.690
- So today, I'm up here
in Rimforest.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.192
This is pretty much
like my backyard.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.460
You know, it's not
too far from home.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.994
Nothing but mountains
and trees.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.896
People come up here to get
away from the big city,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.098
and that's exactly what
I'm doing today, too.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.500
I don't have to worry about
those so-called

01:39.533 --> 01:41.169
big buyers coming up here.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.870
So you know what?
I'm feeling lucky.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.339
I might steal me
three units today.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.574
- Whoo!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.041
Up in the mountains!

01:48.075 --> 01:50.711
One of my most favorite places
there is to buy units.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.480
Makes me think of fishing,
hunting,

01:52.513 --> 01:54.348
and hopefully, they got some
country boy stuff in this unit.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.049
If I don't find
any country stuff,

01:56.083 --> 01:57.818
at least I'm gonna
do some country stuff.

01:57.851 --> 01:58.886
Like go fishing!

01:58.919 --> 02:00.754
This is the only guy
I can relate to.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.556
He's hard,

02:02.590 --> 02:04.057
giant when he needs to be,

02:04.091 --> 02:05.693
kind when he wants to be,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.328
eats meat and berries.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.630
Hey, we're like brothers, huh?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.632
Two big, dark-colored bears.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.133
- What the hell
are you doing, Ivy?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.968
- I was getting some fishing
tips from my old bear here.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.571
- You would figure
he would know.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.973
Hey, man.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.509
Thanks for being here.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.311
- You're welcome.
Damn.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.445
*

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979
- Aw, damn it.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.715
Looks like my plan
for a nice, easy day

02:27.748 --> 02:28.916
just went out
the window, man.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.050
I didn't know we were doing

02:30.083 --> 02:31.051
bring your kids
to work day, though.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.388
- He just called you my kid!

02:34.422 --> 02:35.856
- So what are you
looking for today?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.958
- I don't know, I was looking
to avoid all these buyers,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.893
but I see Dumbass the Kid
again here.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.295
Call me a sauerkraut,

02:41.329 --> 02:44.265
but I only like a sausage party
during Oktoberfest.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.234
- Here comes that
stain collector.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.068
- Yeah, he always makes fun
of me that I'm fat,

02:48.101 --> 02:50.271
but tell me, don't those
ankles look swollen as hell?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.939
- I think it's his tiny feet.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.375
- I'm out of here,
I ain't got time for this crap.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.644
Chad, let's go. You don't have
to put up with that abuse.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.379
- Chad, go lotion up his legs!

02:58.412 --> 02:59.747
- Jesus!

02:59.780 --> 03:02.850
- Do they even make
cargo shorts anymore?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.252
- Yeah, they do, you dummy.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.586
*

03:05.619 --> 03:06.620
Watch what you're saying.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.988
- Welcome to the auction!

03:08.021 --> 03:08.989
We're Dan and Laura Dotson,
American Auctioneers.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.123
- Whoo!

03:10.157 --> 03:11.124
- Before you go
through these gates,

03:11.158 --> 03:12.593
you need to know the rules.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.994
We're gonna go to the unit,
we're gonna remove the lock,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.229
we're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.830
You can't go inside,
you can't open any boxes.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.466
And who's ever got the most
money in their pocket

03:18.499 --> 03:19.867
can own it today.
Are you ready?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.602
Let's go!
- Yeah!

03:23.637 --> 03:25.373
- $100!
- I heard that!

03:25.406 --> 03:27.975
- All right, 120.
- Listen to that, Dan!

03:28.008 --> 03:29.176
The door hasn't even opened
yet,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.177
and we've got a bid
of 120.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.813
Come on, folks, let's go!

03:32.846 --> 03:34.915
Welcome to the
mountains, folks!

03:34.948 --> 03:38.752
*

03:38.786 --> 03:40.854
- Actually, that chandelier
with the horns is kind of cool.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.055
- Yeah, it is.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.392
- Got some copper pipe
and some wrenches.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.559
- You think the guy
was a collector?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.795
- No, this is--
a collector of crap.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.263
A crap collector.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.431
- I think this is junk, bro.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.699
- Good observation.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.267
Not for us?
- Not for us.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.735
- That's why I brought you.

03:54.768 --> 03:55.936
- Cluster of trash
that I'm not

03:55.969 --> 03:57.237
really interested
in right now.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.206
I want something that's
more neat, more high-end.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.141
So hopefully, you know,
we got that in the next one.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.776
*

04:02.810 --> 04:04.878
- Wow, the chandelier with
the horns is really cool.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.647
That's gotta be worth
a few hundred dollars.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.181
But to be honest, this unit
kind of looks like

04:08.215 --> 04:10.284
they took out what they wanted,
and left the rest behind.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.820
There's just a lot more work
than profit in here, I think.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.355
- I've seen a lot
of units in my day,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.357
but this one is
definitely different.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.825
This is the reason why
I love storage units,

04:17.858 --> 04:19.693
'cause you never, ever know
what you're gonna find.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.694
I'll go 120.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.762
- All right, boys and girls,

04:21.795 --> 04:22.863
let's get to rockin'
and talkin',

04:22.896 --> 04:23.864
if you're ready to go,
I'm ready to go.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.932
- 120!
- I got 120.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.634
- I figure copper wire
and nothing else.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.469
- 20 bucks!

04:28.502 --> 04:31.238
- No, I don't want it for 130.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.640
130, going once.
- Tell him, folks.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.907
- 130, going twice.
- I'm finna get it, baby.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.142
- Last and final call--
- I'm finna get it.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.745
Sold it to you, Ivy, for $120.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.279
That got it, that got it.
Come on, come on.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.617
You don't get more
country than that.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.985
- Okay, he's on his way!

04:45.018 --> 04:46.954
- Hey, did you become
Ivy's assistant?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.221
- No, man.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.290
- I'm just asking!

04:50.324 --> 04:51.825
- Hey, leave D alone, man.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.427
- Oh, come on.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.728
He's probably making
you wear those socks

04:54.762 --> 04:55.829
for, like, some kind
of punishment.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.864
You lost a bet.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.299
Well, you know what,

04:59.333 --> 05:00.834
He's gonna need your social
at the end of the day.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.937
He's writing you off on his
taxes, 'cause he's your daddy.

05:06.039 --> 05:10.344
- All right, Laura,
show 'em something special!

05:12.413 --> 05:14.548
- All right, come on,
nice corner unit,

05:14.582 --> 05:17.651
get ready, here we go!
Rimforest!

05:17.685 --> 05:20.721
*

05:20.754 --> 05:22.390
- We got some nice
woodwork back there.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.124
Everything's boxed up,
exactly what I want.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.659
And since I'm not
too far from home,

05:25.693 --> 05:26.794
easy to come pick
this up today.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.228
- Look at the old rocker.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.463
No, not him.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.099
- No, this one.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.768
- Yeah, not you, I meant
that old rocker!

05:36.604 --> 05:38.171
- We gotta get one, man.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.040
Can't you see that painting
over there. Can you see it?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.575
- Not a painting, it's a print.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.911
- All right.
- Switch.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.546
- Those old chairs are ornate.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.780
They got a little bit of
something on them.

05:46.814 --> 05:47.815
- Oh, yeah.
That's some pressed back oak.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.082
- Yeah!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.651
- Definitely some money
to be made in here.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.786
I'll bid a little bit,
but I won't go too far.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.722
- The boxes over here
are open and unpacked.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.989
There's a jewelry box right
down the middle

05:56.023 --> 05:57.658
nobody probably recognized.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.596
- There's a jewelry box
right down the middle, too.
Why are you laughin'?
You saw the jewelry box?

06:02.630 --> 06:03.831
Why are you laughin'?
I bet you 100 bucks, hold on,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.065
100 bucks.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.400
- Don't double look.
- Let me double look!

06:06.434 --> 06:07.835
- You just make fun of me.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.670
I'll bet you 100 bucks, and
I'll give you 5-to-1 odds.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.505
*

06:11.539 --> 06:12.873
- If it's a jewelry box,
then it's a jewelry box.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.743
- No, I'm not taking the bet.
- That's what I thought.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.678
- If you're a veteran buyer,
it's definitely a jewelry box.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.946
- Whoo!
- That's the difference.

06:18.979 --> 06:19.947
- So evil!
I mean, really!

06:19.980 --> 06:21.148
- All right, here we go.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.215
What's your money,
what's your pleasure?

06:22.249 --> 06:23.517
What are you gonna pay?

06:23.551 --> 06:24.652
Say how much, how much,
how much money worth?

06:24.685 --> 06:25.786
- 50.
- 50 bucks.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.020
- It's a good buy.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.556
What about 75?

06:28.589 --> 06:29.857
- She's right here.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.559
- 100, 125, 125.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.626
- I see 300 in there.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.994
- 125, ma'am.

06:34.027 --> 06:34.995
- 125 back there.
- In the back.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.296
- Yeah.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.566
- Tell him, folks!

06:38.599 --> 06:40.167
- 150 going once, 150 there.
- Here.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.770
- Darrell.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.606
250 I see 300 there.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.074
- Yeah!
- 325, 350.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.310
- Come on, rookie,
don't stop now!

06:50.343 --> 06:52.379
- Yeah!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.783
Laying in bed next to you,
and belching sausage?

06:55.816 --> 06:57.585
Someone has to.
He's got a child.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.220
500? Come on, continue
the dance, Justin.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.755
- Don't stop bidding now,
tough guy.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.956
You're bidding against me.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.158
500 going once--

07:05.192 --> 07:06.159
500 going twice.
- Nice unit!

07:07.461 --> 07:08.496
- Tell us!

07:08.529 --> 07:09.763
- You're weak, boy,
you're weak.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.231
- You can have it, Darrell.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.400
- Sold it your way, Darrell.
You got it for 500, Darrell.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.336
- When they said there was
jewelry box in here,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.005
but I bought it for
another reason:

07:18.038 --> 07:19.540
because Rene wanted it.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.542
- Skills to pay the bills.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.210
- Last unit, folks!

07:23.243 --> 07:25.779
- Would you want to wake up
to that, eating sausage?

07:25.813 --> 07:27.715
*

07:27.748 --> 07:29.082
- Sorry, he's weird.
Just ignore him.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.250
- There's nothing weird
about it.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.852
There ain't a woman
here that said yes yet.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.522
- He has low confidence,
so he has to bully everybody.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.194
*

07:41.228 --> 07:44.064
- All right, here we go!

07:44.097 --> 07:45.599
5x10!

07:45.633 --> 07:47.367
- God, mattresses
in every unit?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.136
That hard shell case
looks kind of cool.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.771
I don't know.
We'll see.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.939
- Well...

07:51.972 --> 07:54.207
Compound bow case,
which is very nice.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.009
The better the case, usually,
the better the bow.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.244
I'm gonna bid.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.112
And that's the only
reason why, that bow.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.849
That's a bow case!

08:01.882 --> 08:03.584
Ivy would recognize--have
you been up here, Ivy?

08:03.617 --> 08:05.318
- Yes, sir.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.521
- Oh, no, it's just, um...
- Yeah.

08:07.555 --> 08:10.190
- That's, um...
- Don't lie to me!

08:10.223 --> 08:11.559
- I don't know, D.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.661
I don't think this has got
much value at all, bro.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.495
- Glad we got the locker we did.
- Okay.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.197
- Got some nice wooden pieces.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.066
I see a nice little rocking
chair in the back there.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.400
Books,
I sell books really easy,

08:20.433 --> 08:21.835
I make good money off those.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.504
What's in that case is gonna
make it or break it, so...

08:24.538 --> 08:26.640
You know, I might throw a swing
just for that case by itself.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.508
Unlike all these other
guys, I'm done talking.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.110
Now, it's time for buying.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.411
- And if you're ready to go,
I'm ready to go, here we go.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.412
And we got a little
manly-man unit,

08:32.445 --> 08:33.413
what are you gonna pay?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.414
- Yeah.
- 50 there.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.749
75

08:35.783 --> 08:36.750
100, 100?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.018
- He's bidding there.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.053
- Justin, Justin, I think
they finally dropped.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.221
- 125, Darrell,
you're in or are you out?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.355
- I'm not in.
- 150!

08:42.389 --> 08:44.124
- You're out now.
- I haven't bid once.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.525
- I'm 150.
- 150 there.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.595
- 175 now, looking for 200.
I got 200 bucks.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.629
225? 225 there.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.997
250? I'm looking for 250 now.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.899
250
- Got you. Got caught.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.768
- 275, looking for 300. 300.
- You need to get a locker!

08:54.802 --> 08:56.469
350?

08:56.503 --> 08:57.938
350!
- 500!

08:57.971 --> 08:59.607
- 500!

08:59.640 --> 09:00.808
525! 550!

09:00.841 --> 09:02.409
550, where? Going twice.
Last and final call!

09:03.644 --> 09:06.113
Sold it your way, Justin,
unit for $525!

09:06.146 --> 09:07.180
Justin!
- You got it!

09:07.214 --> 09:08.682
- You gotta try
harder than that

09:08.716 --> 09:10.150
to take down this young buck.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.585
- Thank you, folks!
That's the end of the sale!

09:11.619 --> 09:12.886
And don't forget
to pay the lady!

09:12.920 --> 09:14.287
Thank you!

09:14.321 --> 09:15.288
- Can't win every day.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.389
- That's true.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.091
- I got a good one.
- Yeah, right.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.459
In your opinion, maybe.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.065
- All right,
let's do this, Chad.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.167
There's our table,
right there.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.002
- Ooh, look at that Japanese!

09:29.036 --> 09:31.038
- Jewelry box.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.873
- It's a leaded jewelry--
ooh, it's old.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.242
- That thing's probably
worth 40 bucks.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.877
This is fireplace implements,

09:36.910 --> 09:38.511
that's an easy 40 bucks
right there.

09:38.545 --> 09:42.082
Little indoor grill, right?
That's 25 bucks.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.416
Some really cool stuff in here.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.485
Well, these are ox bells.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.688
- Oh, they chant to that--
that Hindu thing?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.022
- They don't chant for nothing.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.724
They can hear the oxes
when they're in the field.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.861
I'll get about 25 bucks
out of those bells.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.928
Look out!

09:54.962 --> 09:56.529
Nice catch!

09:56.563 --> 09:58.999
There's a nice jewelry box here.
- Sweet!

09:59.032 --> 10:02.202
- But it looks like they took
all the drawers out of it.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.570
See what happened here?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.038
- That's jacked up!

10:05.072 --> 10:06.273
- That's right, it got jacked.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.576
- I wish Justin would've
taken Rene's bet.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.846
Hell, I may end up wishing
Justin took this locker too.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.847
Look at this.

10:13.881 --> 10:14.982
- Remember, I saw those!

10:15.015 --> 10:16.817
- That's 25 bucks right there.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.918
This thing's pretty cool.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.820
This is a smoker stand
right here.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.321
They used to put the spittoon

10:21.354 --> 10:22.990
and the ashtrays
and all that in here.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.325
Turn of the century English.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.661
- Yeah, this is probably
an easy 200 bucks.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.662
- Yes!

10:28.696 --> 10:30.063
- This one's in better shape.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.699
Without the marble, 100 bucks.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.833
- Nice!

10:32.866 --> 10:34.935
- Looks like some
type of little

10:34.968 --> 10:36.937
pressure gauge or something.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.638
A cow milker or something.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.141
- Oh, that's different.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.811
- This is a trip. It'd be fun
to get this checked out.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.279
Why you looking at my hair?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.281
- Yes!

10:48.315 --> 10:50.050
- You using that sun bum
spray and such?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.485
- You don't ask a girl
if she bleaches.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.257
- Let's check this thing
out right here.
- Let's check this thing out
right here.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.326
- Yeah!
Ooh!

10:59.359 --> 11:00.593
- This is a good find.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.332
- It looks like it's
a brand new shearer for goats,

11:05.365 --> 11:08.001
or sheep or something
like that.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.069
That's sharp, isn't it?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.303
- It's a little sharp!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.539
- Yeah.
- Sharper than you.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.042
- Ew! You know
I'm a germophobe, bro!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.079
- I don't know, now put that
over there, Brando, let's go!

11:19.112 --> 11:20.480
- All right, let's do it!

11:20.513 --> 11:23.083
- This is really, really nice.
This is walnut.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.986
- I can look at the
grain of the wood.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.487
- Dude, you're so smart!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.289
- I think it's 1930s.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.924
100 bucks, easy.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.926
40 bucks in purses right there.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.062
We'll get 40 bucks for
this set of luggage.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.263
Look at this.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.932
You know, it's 1920,
something like that.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.868
We'll get about 120 bucks
out of it.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.635
Let's move this mattress out.
- All right.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.073
- This is some kind of
weird table or something.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.107
- That is weird.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.742
- Put this thing together.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.143
*

11:51.578 --> 11:54.081
- No, they wouldn't
fold in like that.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.816
- Wow, D!

11:55.849 --> 11:58.085
*

11:58.118 --> 11:59.787
What we gonna take
this thing at?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.822
- I don't know,
we'll take it--oh!

12:01.855 --> 12:04.257
- That's for shearing sheep.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.461
- We can go see a shepherd.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.897
- Aw.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.667
- Time to see what we got.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.269
I paid a little more
than I wanted,

12:16.303 --> 12:18.071
but I wasn't gonna
go home empty-handed.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.974
Oh, all right, looks like
we got a lamp. Very clean.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.309
$20 on this.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.944
Nice little set-up.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.179
$20 on that.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.915
Nice little side table here.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.150
This is easily a $30 table.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.484
30 bucks too!

12:31.518 --> 12:32.752
Some Sega games.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.221
Looks like pretty much
everything's in here.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.488
25 bucks.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.725
Now this, could easily
bring me a good 35 bucks.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.594
Some saws--that's $75 there.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.997
Oh, man, that's older
than my grandparents!

12:44.031 --> 12:45.732
Know what's worse than one VCR?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.467
A double VCR!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.903
This DVD player could easily
bring me 20 bucks.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.772
$2 a book, I see about
30 books in there.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.407
$25 on the lamp here.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.876
70 bucks on the chair.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.510
I sell kid's clothes
pretty easy.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.247
Looks like we got about $100
right there on the shirts.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.449
This is what mattered
most to me.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.450
Ugh!

13:03.483 --> 13:04.985
I don't think it's in here.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.987
Feels kind of light.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.789
If it's not in here,
this unit was a total bust.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.125
Oh, boy!

13:12.159 --> 13:14.194
All right, let's go, baby!

13:14.227 --> 13:15.662
This thing is a beauty!

13:15.695 --> 13:17.664
I'm not really too familiar
with how much these cost.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.199
So I'm going to have to get
this checked out, man.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.201
This thing is awesome!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.669
Shootin' right into the money!

13:24.872 --> 13:26.273
- Glad I didn't pay too much,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.842
'cause I'm sure quite how much
scrap there is in here.

13:28.876 --> 13:29.910
I know there's a lot.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.344
*

13:31.378 --> 13:32.812
Here's my beautiful unit.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.747
If you don't love to work,
or even like to work,

13:34.781 --> 13:36.950
this definitely ain't the unit
for the average person.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.619
Well, up here,
this is a nice $20 lamp.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.088
$20 worth of copper wire.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.890
$10 lamp right there.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.357
Another $10 lamp right there.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.592
$10 lamp right there.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.394
All that wire, 20 bucks.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.462
Right here is rods
for tightening down walls.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.463
10 bucks.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.099
Ugh. Whoo!

13:52.132 --> 13:53.600
Hopefully, there's wire in here,
'cause it's heavy.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.734
*

13:54.767 --> 13:56.603
Oh, yeah.
Down here on the bottom,

13:56.636 --> 13:58.105
look at all that wire.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.539
Another 50 bucks in wire.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.341
The thing I love about scrap is

14:01.374 --> 14:03.443
whatever it is per pound,
they hand you cash.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.779
No money, but 10 bucks
for that.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.381
$20 in that bag.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.683
This is called #1 copper.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.986
Look how heavy that is,
look how strong that is.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.888
That's the real money,
you get a lot of that,

14:14.922 --> 14:16.123
you going to the bank.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.191
This whole thing here,
you got $100.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.559
Pipes to run your
electrical wire,

14:19.592 --> 14:21.794
you got about 50 bucks
right there.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.131
I think profit's calling me
on this phone.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.934
It's always good
to hear from you.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.868
Wow, look up here!
Outdoor lamps.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.137
This one right here,

14:30.170 --> 14:32.372
good 15 bucks,
that's wrought iron right there.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.674
25, 25...

14:34.707 --> 14:36.876
Look like a longhorn
sheep horns,

14:36.910 --> 14:38.545
100 bucks, easy.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.647
That's pretty much what
I paid for the whole unit.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.282
Got another 30 bucks
worth of wire.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.584
Right here, fuse box,
marked at 200.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.986
I can get 50 for it.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.620
Some electrician gonna
come into my store,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.756
he gonna be happy-nappy.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.625
Light fixtures, all this--
there's a $100 chest right here.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.860
*

14:53.893 --> 14:55.795
At $1 apiece, and there's 100,
there's 100 bucks

14:55.828 --> 14:57.130
in this trash bag alone.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.699
Ain't it nice to find
$100 in a trash bag?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.101
Oh, man. Look at this light.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.970
Wow, that's a pretty one.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.072
Oh, look at that big,
fat crystal lamp.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.839
Oh, this one's weird.
Look at that.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.976
Vintage, awesome flower.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.144
All these lamps right here,
200 bucks.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.646
Oh, yeah.
Tell me that ain't cool.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.415
Easily a $200 corner
right there.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.350
Be here, be here, be here!

15:17.384 --> 15:20.320
Whoo! All right,
good name brand too.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.388
30 bucks!

15:21.421 --> 15:23.023
Well, I'm on the home stretch.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.392
Brand new, in the box,
ceiling fan, 50 bucks.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.227
Other one up there,
50 bucks.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.329
This cabinet, lot of fixtures.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.798
This whole, entire cabinet,
50 bucks.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.600
Now, get my trophy
piece out of here.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.601
*

15:36.036 --> 15:38.505
When you get a room this cheap,
and it's this good,

15:38.538 --> 15:39.973
you gotta take a trophy home.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.141
I'ma hang this up.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.775
Well, if the wife lets me.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.549
Ivy, let him in!

15:49.582 --> 15:50.650
- All right!
Hey, man, how are you?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.386
- I know that Ivy
wanted this bow too,

15:53.420 --> 15:54.587
so I'm here at
Grandma's Attic,

15:54.621 --> 15:55.955
to see if he wants
to buy it from me.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.091
- I got dressed in
my best camo just for you.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.926
- Yes, sir.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.861
When you're too cheap
to buy the real thing,

16:01.894 --> 16:03.096
use something you found
in the unit.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.798
Open this thing up,
what you waitin' on?

16:05.832 --> 16:08.135
Oh, wow. Okay.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.304
This is almost what
we would call a junior's bow.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.806
It's not a full-size length of
bow, but now, back in the day,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.142
bows were this big.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.177
Now, they make bows for me
and my size this big.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.546
So you can sit up in a tree
stand with not a lot of room,

16:19.579 --> 16:21.248
or be behind a blind,
and shoot through an arrow,

16:21.281 --> 16:22.782
you don't need
giant bows anymore.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.085
It's got a nice peephole here.
- It's basically like a scope.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.620
- Peephole!
- Peephole, okay.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.755
- I don't think you're
peeing through there.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.989
If you are,
you're hella accurate.

16:30.023 --> 16:30.990
But this is a nice bow.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.292
- Seems like you
guys really like it.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.127
How much you want
to give me for it?

16:34.161 --> 16:35.495
- It's a good bow,
I won't lie.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.297
A little bit too small
for everybody in my family,

16:37.330 --> 16:39.332
the wife might be able
to shoot it.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.867
Tell you what,
I'll make you a bet.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.803
I'll give you 300, if you can
hit California mule-bear-deer.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.272
- Let's fire it up.
- All right.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.341
*

16:48.375 --> 16:51.178
Whoa, horsey!
Keep that point that way!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.545
Okay, first thing you do,

16:52.579 --> 16:54.414
put your arm all the way out,
then you pull back.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.049
- Hey, you might want
to stop helping him.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.150
- Oh, yeah, that is true.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.618
Keep pulling, keep pulling.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.886
*

16:59.919 --> 17:01.888
Oh, might have skimmed him!

17:01.921 --> 17:03.890
- Hey, you missed!
- You skimmed him!

17:03.923 --> 17:06.693
Missed! Missed!
- No, I hit him! Look!

17:06.726 --> 17:07.794
You said I had to touch him.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.296
- No, I said
you had to hit him.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.064
Okay, I'm a good sport.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.599
I'll give you 200 for it.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.868
It was worth watching you
miss at 10 steps away.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.370
- 'Cause I'm a lover,
not a killer.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.040
*

17:21.074 --> 17:23.810
- Well, I think this is the
place, Chad. I see goats.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.013
Chad and I are at the
Chivas Skin Care Goat Farm

17:27.046 --> 17:30.450
to meet with Donna Johanson
and Lauren Johanson-Jones,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.552
I hope they'll tell me
about the livestock

17:32.585 --> 17:34.020
gitchimagoos I found.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.356
- Go for it, guys.
- Let's get it going.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.490
- All right.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.126
- D, we couldn't figure
this out before.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.560
- Shh, don't tell them that.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.230
- Let's see.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.897
- Watch your fingers, girls.
- Yep.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.032
I couldn't live without these,

17:46.065 --> 17:47.734
I use them twice a day
to milk my goats.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.068
- Goes like this.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.104
- There we go.
- Oh, yeah.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.472
Now we feel dumb!

17:52.505 --> 17:54.274
- This just needs
a little elbow grease.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.775
- Sure.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.544
- This is where maybe
a man comes in, here.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.149
- It's so chauvinistic.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.783
- Okay, what do you got
in here?

18:03.816 --> 18:05.252
- I really don't know.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.953
I thought maybe it was
for a human.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.221
- Human.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.389
- Oh, jeez.
- No.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.723
- Goat only has
two nipples too?

18:10.757 --> 18:11.991
- That is accurate.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.860
- They're not called nipples,
they're called teats.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.295
And yes, they only
have two, whereas--

18:15.328 --> 18:16.296
- Teats!

18:16.329 --> 18:17.897
T-E-A-T-S.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.466
- No comment.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.868
Honestly, what do you do with
the goat milk

18:21.901 --> 18:23.203
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.505
We drink the raw goat milk,
and we use the raw goat milk

18:25.538 --> 18:27.674
to make handmade,
goat milk soaps.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.442
- Chaddy-cakes would love
to try some goat milk.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.643
- No.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.145
- What do you think the
teat

18:32.179 --> 18:34.714
- I would say about $200.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.849
- Now that's pretty heavy-duty.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.485
This is an electric shearer,

18:38.518 --> 18:40.086
and you can use it for goats,
or sheep.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.323
- What do you think the
shearer thing is worth?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.392
- Um, I'd say about 100 bucks.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.793
- Used. Yeah.
- Used. Yeah.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.661
- I like it.
- Probably, the main part

18:48.695 --> 18:51.130
of this whole thing
is gonna be under here.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.333
- Well, I think it'll probably
be easier to show you guys

18:53.366 --> 18:54.834
how it works,
rather than explain it.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.469
So why don't we get the goats?
- Yeah, it would.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.570
- Let's go get Rosa.
- And we'll be back.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.938
Chad, do you want to give us
a hand?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.274
- Yeah, hold this, D.
- You guys have fun.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.377
- Yeah, get the meanest goat
you got.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.612
- This is scary, man.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.647
There's like land mines
everywhere.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.250
- City boy on a goat farm
just don't make it.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.619
- Here, goaty, goaty,
goaty, goaty!

19:12.652 --> 19:14.621
Here, goat.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.155
- Look out!
Chad, watch your back!

19:16.189 --> 19:18.691
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

19:20.360 --> 19:21.728
That was--get on up here.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.431
Look at that.
Hey, I'm a goat farmer, bro!

19:24.464 --> 19:27.300
- This is your milking pail
that you should put down here.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.670
- This is not my fault, whatever
they're doing to you.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.873
- Uh, I'm watching you.
I'm learning.

19:33.906 --> 19:34.974
- Go ahead.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.709
So what do you think it's worth,
Donna?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.412
- So these run about 250, new.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.849
It's hard to find milking stands
used.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.486
I'll offer you 100 bucks.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.754
- Tell you what I'll do:

19:47.787 --> 19:50.323
100 bucks in cash and 100 bucks
in product.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.325
- Okay, well...
- You only have cost

19:52.359 --> 19:53.626
in the product.
- Hey, D,

19:53.660 --> 19:57.530
that doesn't sound like
a "baaahd" deal to me.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.799
narrator: Ivy Calvin lit up
the competition,

19:59.832 --> 20:02.635
making over $1,200 in profit.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.972
Darrell and Chad milked $755

20:06.005 --> 20:08.875
out of their goat
gitchimagoos.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.843
Justin Bryant aimed high,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.980
but only landed 185 bucks.

20:14.013 --> 20:18.184
While Rene Nezhoda
didn't get schnitzel.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.621
Grab ahold of that teat
and get some milk.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.823
- D, I don't have
any hand sanitizer.

20:23.856 --> 20:24.957
- Uh, we got some in the truck.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.526
- Come on.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.794
- You don't have--
it's not gonna bite you.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.895
- Sit down.
- Just actin' like

20:28.928 --> 20:30.029
a little weenie.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.098
Get up there
and squeeze that teat.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.302
Chad.
Did you see it?

20:35.335 --> 20:38.571
What? It's not my fault!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.574
I hate this!

20:41.608 --> 20:44.076
- It's awesome.
- I think she hates it too.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.978
- Not one drop!
