WEBVTT

00:11.130 --> 00:14.532
Um, it's 2:00 A.M. What's
with all the balloons?

00:14.534 --> 00:16.667
You having some clowns over?

00:17.770 --> 00:20.271
No, it's for another dumb school thing

00:20.273 --> 00:22.239
in Emme's kindergarten class.

00:22.241 --> 00:24.504
Mrs. Rodriguez wants a
hundred balloons blown up.

00:24.529 --> 00:27.430
I've already blacked out three times.

00:28.381 --> 00:30.281
Well, um...

00:30.283 --> 00:32.883
why don't you just use the balloon pump?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.521
Because I didn't know what that was.

00:38.357 --> 00:39.400
I thought it was a...

00:39.425 --> 00:41.892
lady thing.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.940
Right. 'Cause I keep all my lady things

00:44.942 --> 00:47.610
in the kids' cubbies.

00:47.612 --> 00:51.781
What function did you think
this would perform exactly?

00:55.420 --> 00:58.254
Yeah, I don't think you
want me to answer that.

00:58.256 --> 00:59.755
Yeah. You're probably right.

00:59.757 --> 01:01.363
You know,

01:01.388 --> 01:03.726
when Rodriguez roped me
into being room parent,

01:03.728 --> 01:05.703
she never told me how
much work it would be.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.428
They celebrate everything.

01:08.304 --> 01:09.131
Well, Adam,

01:09.155 --> 01:10.961
- m-most people like parties. 
- Yeah.

01:10.962 --> 01:12.334
But it's never-ending.

01:12.336 --> 01:14.030
I've organized '80s Day,

01:14.055 --> 01:16.055
'90s Day, and you remember Future Day.

01:16.207 --> 01:18.741
I had to wear a tinfoil suit.

01:20.522 --> 01:23.109
I'm sorry, honey, but
look on the bright side.

01:23.134 --> 01:26.636
Now that I'm working, I
don't have to do it anymore.

01:27.844 --> 01:29.962
I lost my sense of
humor 30 balloons ago.

01:32.790 --> 01:35.391
Look, honey. I-I know it's a lot, but...

01:35.393 --> 01:38.064
you know, I would be freaking
out at work all the time

01:38.089 --> 01:39.519
if you weren't doing such a good job

01:39.544 --> 01:41.764
as captain of the parenting ship.

01:45.403 --> 01:47.303
I'm the captain?

01:47.305 --> 01:50.973
Yes. You're the captain.
From 7:45 to 5:15,

01:50.975 --> 01:53.175
- and then, when I get home... 
- We're co-captains.

01:53.177 --> 01:54.838
Okay, sure.

01:56.722 --> 01:57.921
Okay, Emme.

01:57.946 --> 01:59.929
You did such a good job helping,

01:59.954 --> 02:02.483
I'm gonna sneak a couple
extra cookies in your cubby.

02:02.508 --> 02:05.437
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Aww.

02:05.462 --> 02:07.663
Hey, it pays to know the right guy, huh?

02:07.688 --> 02:08.983
Hmm. Hi, sweetheart.

02:09.008 --> 02:11.642
You can catch up with the
other kids on the playground.

02:13.364 --> 02:17.166
Oh. Not bad. Look who
finally got it together.

02:17.546 --> 02:20.373
That's the kind of praise
that makes it all worthwhile.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.955
Okay, I'm out of here.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.312
Oh, Mr. Burns, one more thing.

02:24.346 --> 02:25.979
Teacher Appreciation Day is coming up,

02:25.981 --> 02:27.681
so there's gonna be a party.

02:27.706 --> 02:29.606
Of course there is.

02:30.577 --> 02:33.231
So, we're gonna need food,
decorations and games.

02:33.435 --> 02:36.268
This isn't a school,
it's a Chuck E. Cheese.

02:36.825 --> 02:38.813
Oh, but the most important thing

02:38.838 --> 02:40.394
is the Teacher Appreciation gift,

02:40.396 --> 02:43.063
which each room parent
organizes. This year,

02:43.065 --> 02:45.532
I'd like you to make me puppets.

02:46.635 --> 02:48.335
Kids like puppets.

02:48.337 --> 02:49.770
No, they don't.

02:50.539 --> 02:52.005
They haven't liked puppets since...

02:52.007 --> 02:54.374
anything else was invented.

02:54.376 --> 02:57.044
Mr. Burns, why do you
have to be so difficult?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.898
No other room parent has ever
caused me this much trouble.

02:59.923 --> 03:03.016
Well... it just seems like
you're crossing a line.

03:03.018 --> 03:04.618
You know, you're taking
advantage of me because

03:04.620 --> 03:06.697
my daughter's in your
class, and you know...

03:06.722 --> 03:08.289
I like her.

03:09.325 --> 03:11.325
I'm only being hard
on you because I know

03:11.327 --> 03:12.726
you're capable of better work.

03:12.728 --> 03:14.094
So, dig deep,

03:14.408 --> 03:15.976
and make me puppets.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.399
You know what? No.

03:19.401 --> 03:21.401
But they're for Teacher
Appreciation Day.

03:21.403 --> 03:23.870
I got to be honest. I
don't appreciate you.

03:24.906 --> 03:26.840
When Teacher Resentment Day comes along,

03:26.865 --> 03:28.431
I'm your man.

03:28.799 --> 03:31.546
Plus, I don't have time to make puppets.

03:31.571 --> 03:34.633
Mr. Burns, being a room
parent is a full-time job.

03:34.658 --> 03:37.918
No. No, my full-time
job is my full-time job.

03:38.410 --> 03:41.054
I have three construction
projects going on right now.

03:41.056 --> 03:44.224
Okay. Why don't you take
all this negative energy,

03:44.226 --> 03:46.960
and put it into making puppets.

03:47.410 --> 03:49.396
I got a better idea. I quit.

03:49.398 --> 03:52.517
Uh... no. You can't quit. As
long as Emme's in my class,

03:52.542 --> 03:54.304
you're the room parent.
And if you don't like it,

03:54.329 --> 03:55.969
you can transfer her to the other class.

03:55.971 --> 03:57.638
Hold on a second.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.139
That's an option?

03:59.567 --> 04:01.719
- Well, technically, yes.
- I could just...

04:01.744 --> 04:02.840
put her in the other class?

04:03.575 --> 04:04.876
They already have a room parent.

04:04.900 --> 04:05.719
Okay.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.814
- Trust me, you don't want to do that.
- Oh, I think I do.

04:07.816 --> 04:08.783
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

04:08.808 --> 04:09.838
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

04:09.863 --> 04:10.771
- No, you don't.
- See, this is

04:10.796 --> 04:11.962
one of the issues.

04:13.203 --> 04:14.177
No, it's not.

04:16.264 --> 04:17.127
All right, I've had enough.

04:17.152 --> 04:18.759
I'm transferring Emme out of this class.

04:18.761 --> 04:19.628
Fine.

04:21.502 --> 04:22.829
Here's the transfer form.

04:22.831 --> 04:25.332
- Now, we have a reason to party.
- Hmm.

04:25.909 --> 04:26.633
No, we don't.

04:26.635 --> 04:27.688
Yes, we do.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.072 --> 04:45.290
So long, suckers. I'm transferring Emme

04:45.315 --> 04:47.018
out of Mrs. Rodriguez's class.

04:47.043 --> 04:48.178
So, who's gonna be our room parent?

04:48.203 --> 04:50.470
I can't do it. I got to
go home and sit around.

04:51.814 --> 04:54.404
But you can't just leave
me. You're my mentor.

04:55.388 --> 04:57.287
People our age don't
have mentors, Lowell,

04:57.312 --> 04:59.745
they've already... mented.

04:59.922 --> 05:03.263
Not me. After years of being a
stay-at-home dad to two girls,

05:03.288 --> 05:04.972
you're showing me how to be a man again.

05:05.082 --> 05:07.347
Thanks to you, I started
watching the sports report.

05:07.372 --> 05:09.618
âBoom,â says that one guy.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.586
Great job. I'm proud of you.

05:11.588 --> 05:14.456
Now all we got to do is get that
jazzercise sticker off your car.

05:16.427 --> 05:18.460
Over my dead body.

05:22.099 --> 05:24.933
Hold on. So, you just transferred Emme

05:24.935 --> 05:27.836
into another class, without asking Andi?

05:27.838 --> 05:30.072
I don't need to ask her permission.

05:30.074 --> 05:32.574
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

05:32.576 --> 05:35.877
Little brother. Do
you know what you are?

05:35.879 --> 05:37.913
Adorable.

05:39.278 --> 05:40.380
Let me tell you a little something

05:40.405 --> 05:42.526
about how things work in my house, okay?

05:42.551 --> 05:44.201
I steer the parenting boat.

05:44.226 --> 05:45.821
You know what Andi told me last night?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.522
I'm the captain.

05:47.717 --> 05:49.015
Oh, you are, huh?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.940
- That's right. 
- Uh-huh.

05:51.170 --> 05:52.410
You know how you give a little kid

05:52.435 --> 05:54.017
a fake steering wheel in the backseat

05:54.042 --> 05:55.708
so they can pretend they're driving?

05:55.733 --> 05:57.266
Might even have a little horn.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.368
That's the kind of captain you are.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.800
You don't know what
you're talking about.

06:01.825 --> 06:05.107
Oh. Okay, how about this? Call
Andi. Let's see if I'm right.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.709
Loser has to...

06:08.095 --> 06:10.132
- eat a ghost pepper.
- Ooh.

06:10.157 --> 06:12.491
That's right. The
world's hottest pepper.

06:12.516 --> 06:15.083
- Put your mouth where your mouth is.
- Fine.

06:15.085 --> 06:16.485
But you're gonna be eating that pepper,

06:16.487 --> 06:17.686
and if I know you,

06:17.688 --> 06:18.956
you'll forget and rub your eye.

06:18.981 --> 06:20.213
And if I know me,

06:20.650 --> 06:21.706
I'll be laughing at you.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.180
Hey, honey. What's up?

06:27.205 --> 06:27.759
Hey.

06:27.784 --> 06:29.050
I got a great idea.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.156
You know how Rodriguez has been on me?

06:31.181 --> 06:32.889
Well, I'm thinking
I'm gonna transfer Emme

06:32.914 --> 06:34.681
to the other class. How about that?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.995
Andi?

06:40.647 --> 06:42.531
Do I hear you smiling?

06:42.533 --> 06:44.264
No, I'm not smiling.

06:44.289 --> 06:45.667
That's a terrible idea!

06:45.669 --> 06:47.035
Look, there's only

06:47.037 --> 06:49.071
one good teacher in every grade.

06:49.073 --> 06:51.545
Okay? Y-You have no idea

06:51.570 --> 06:53.495
how much I had to kiss
Mrs. Rodriguez's butt

06:53.520 --> 06:54.659
to get Emme in that class.

06:54.684 --> 06:56.411
So, for you to even think

06:56.413 --> 06:59.014
about transferring her because
you have to work too hard,

06:59.016 --> 07:00.882
makes me so mad, that I'm yelling.

07:00.884 --> 07:02.851
I'm yelling now, and
everybody here's looking at me.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.953
What? This isn't a show, Markowitz.

07:05.865 --> 07:06.427
Good.

07:06.452 --> 07:08.953
Yeah. Take it out on
Markowitz. Bye, honey. Love you.

07:10.713 --> 07:12.961
Hello, ghost pepper store?

07:12.963 --> 07:14.329
I'd like to place an order.

07:18.226 --> 07:19.501
Look, Mrs. Rodriguez,

07:19.526 --> 07:21.280
I would really appreciate it

07:21.305 --> 07:23.672
if you would let Emme
back in your class.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.017
Why would I do that?

07:25.570 --> 07:28.002
Well... what better way to celebrate

07:28.027 --> 07:29.886
the birthday of this fine school

07:29.911 --> 07:33.248
than with the gift of forgetting
what I said this morning?

07:33.250 --> 07:35.057
Or you could apologize

07:35.082 --> 07:36.918
for everything you said this morning.

07:37.575 --> 07:38.526
Okay.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.388
Uh... apparently, you think that I...

07:40.390 --> 07:42.190
No.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.659
If I said something...

07:44.661 --> 07:46.328
No.

07:46.979 --> 07:47.729
If you weren't so...

07:47.754 --> 07:49.688
No!

07:50.986 --> 07:52.345
Fine.

08:00.952 --> 08:02.010
I'm sorry.

08:02.012 --> 08:03.464
Now we're making progress.

08:03.489 --> 08:04.699
Emme can come back to my class.

08:04.724 --> 08:06.715
Oh! Great. Thank you.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.815
Big win for the captain.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.306
Oh, this is gonna mean a lot to Andi.

08:10.331 --> 08:11.927
She's always saying how
you're the best teacher

08:11.952 --> 08:13.051
in the whole school.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.030
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah. She told me

08:15.055 --> 08:17.380
that to get Emme in this
class, she spent years

08:17.405 --> 08:19.672
kissing your butt.

08:21.344 --> 08:22.464
What was that?

08:27.124 --> 08:28.036
Uh...

08:28.038 --> 08:29.971
that... was a compliment.

08:29.973 --> 08:32.974
- No, it wasn't.
- Oh, sure. Sure it was.

08:33.048 --> 08:34.625
Yeah, you know how people are always

08:34.650 --> 08:37.364
joking around and saying crazy stuff?

08:37.389 --> 08:39.914
Like, âHey, Bob.â
âKiss my butt, Jim.â

08:40.486 --> 08:42.442
And then they're laughing,
'cause they're buddies.

08:42.467 --> 08:44.085
You know, j-just like us.

08:44.087 --> 08:46.060
- Oh, so we're buddies now?
- Definitely.

08:46.085 --> 08:47.084
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:47.153 --> 08:48.686
What's my first name?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.197
Uh...

09:03.482 --> 09:05.607
That's what I thought. I
think Emme would be better off

09:05.609 --> 09:06.675
staying in the other class.

09:06.677 --> 09:08.577
What? Oh, come on!

09:08.579 --> 09:10.593
It's not like you know my first name.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.657
Adam.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.991
Oh. Well, yeah. Anyone could guess that.

09:14.016 --> 09:15.250
It's like the first name ever.

09:28.445 --> 09:29.777
What's with the flowers?

09:29.779 --> 09:32.780
Is it the day after
Mom's birthday again?

09:33.850 --> 09:35.426
No.

09:35.451 --> 09:36.984
Wait...

09:38.236 --> 09:39.888
No. No.

09:39.890 --> 09:41.756
Don't scare me like that!

09:42.141 --> 09:43.924
Oh! I think I hear Mom's car.

09:43.949 --> 09:46.520
Okay, guys, go play outside,
and enjoy your childhood,

09:46.545 --> 09:49.112
'cause it only gets more complicated.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.935
Hey. There's my beautiful wife.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.453
Flowers? What for?

09:56.455 --> 09:58.621
Do I need a reason to buy you flowers?

09:58.623 --> 10:00.491
Historically, yes.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.551
Okay, fine. I know this is
gonna make you mad, but...

10:04.623 --> 10:07.340
I transferred Emme out
of Mrs. Rodriguez's class

10:07.365 --> 10:09.804
but look at the pretty flowers!

10:10.132 --> 10:11.178
What?

10:11.203 --> 10:12.875
I can't believe you did that,

10:12.900 --> 10:14.448
after we talked this morning!

10:14.473 --> 10:17.006
Well, not sure this is
gonna help me, but...

10:17.512 --> 10:19.242
I did it before we talked.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.276
Ooh!

10:20.278 --> 10:22.445
Ah!

10:23.328 --> 10:24.314
Oh...

10:24.316 --> 10:25.648
Huh?

10:26.467 --> 10:27.528
All right, look.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.349
Mrs. Rodriguez is impossible!

10:29.374 --> 10:30.720
It's too much work!

10:30.722 --> 10:33.152
Oh, so you did this for
your own selfish reasons.

10:33.177 --> 10:36.746
Well, a lot of great stuff
was done for selfish reasons.

10:37.774 --> 10:39.319
The guy who invented fire.

10:39.344 --> 10:41.811
Probably freezing his ass off.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.487
Oh, my God.

10:43.612 --> 10:45.470
Well, and, and...

10:45.495 --> 10:47.110
it's good for Emme, too.

10:47.135 --> 10:48.894
Her best friend is in the other class.

10:48.919 --> 10:50.619
Yeah, and you know why
the school separated them?

10:50.644 --> 10:51.943
Because they talk too much.

10:52.177 --> 10:54.354
No fair, that is new information.

10:54.969 --> 10:56.379
Well, everything's new information

10:56.381 --> 10:57.914
when you don't know anything.

10:59.899 --> 11:02.752
You know, maybe instead
of just criticizing me,

11:02.754 --> 11:04.759
you could try seeing my side of it.

11:04.784 --> 11:08.218
Yeah, but your side
of it is so... wrong.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.068
You know what?

11:10.235 --> 11:11.905
I'll go down there, I'll talk to her.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.162
She likes me.

11:13.949 --> 11:16.633
Yeah, about that.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.678
Oh, good, it gets worse.

11:19.703 --> 11:21.815
Well, just a little, and
then we're all caught up.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.939
So,

11:22.941 --> 11:24.557
when I went back to apologize,

11:24.582 --> 11:26.334
like I knew you would've wanted me to,

11:26.497 --> 11:29.398
I complimented her, and she got all mad.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.048
How did you compliment her?

11:32.534 --> 11:34.008
Is that really important?

11:36.086 --> 11:37.987
I told her that you kissed her butt

11:38.012 --> 11:39.866
to get Emme into her class,

11:39.891 --> 11:42.848
and, for some reason, she took offense.

11:42.873 --> 11:44.176
Oh. Pfft.

11:44.201 --> 11:45.745
Yeah, so what happened next?

11:45.770 --> 11:47.264
Did you punch her in the throat?

11:47.966 --> 11:48.781
I just...

11:48.806 --> 11:50.339
how could you say that to Alicia?

11:50.435 --> 11:51.469
Alicia!

11:51.494 --> 11:53.513
That's her name.

11:54.854 --> 11:55.766
Look, you know, anyway,

11:55.791 --> 11:58.084
I should be allowed to make
these kind of decisions.

11:58.109 --> 11:59.618
After all, I am the captain.

11:59.643 --> 12:01.121
Yeah, I only told you
that so you'd finish

12:01.146 --> 12:02.412
blowing up the balloons.

12:04.249 --> 12:06.249
Hold on a second.

12:06.251 --> 12:08.863
Are you saying that I'm not the captain?

12:08.888 --> 12:11.225
Well, you're the captain of balloons.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.620
Look, here's what's gonna happen.

12:15.745 --> 12:17.320
I'm gonna go down
there tomorrow with you

12:17.345 --> 12:19.005
and a box of chocolates,
and I'm gonna...

12:19.030 --> 12:20.263
kiss her butt some more,

12:20.584 --> 12:21.850
and I'm gonna fix this.

12:22.143 --> 12:23.331
I don't need you

12:23.356 --> 12:24.574
cleaning up my messes, okay?

12:24.599 --> 12:25.664
I can handle this.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.060
Adam, listen to me,

12:28.484 --> 12:30.505
I am the captain now.

12:39.181 --> 12:40.838
Okay, I don't know if this
is what you were going for,

12:40.863 --> 12:42.734
but I am really turned on right now.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.840
Look, you know what Adam's like.

12:47.864 --> 12:50.096
He-he just says stuff,
he doesn't think.

12:50.121 --> 12:51.920
I really don't.

12:52.163 --> 12:54.802
But to imply that currying
favor has any impact

12:54.827 --> 12:57.394
on how I run my classroom is insulting.

12:57.419 --> 12:59.512
Look, I'm well aware that
parents give me presents

12:59.537 --> 13:01.206
just because they
want something from me.

13:01.231 --> 13:03.539
Ugh. Yeah, those parents are the worst.

13:05.008 --> 13:07.050
- Although the presents are nice.
- Oh, yeah, I mean,

13:07.075 --> 13:08.931
who doesn't like a little
treat now and again?

13:10.081 --> 13:12.100
- But it doesn't change anything.
- No, of course not,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.559
you're above all that.

13:14.653 --> 13:16.019
Just give me the chocolates.

13:19.442 --> 13:21.391
There's a little chart in there

13:21.393 --> 13:23.563
so you don't get surprised by anything.

13:23.588 --> 13:25.794
You wouldn't want to bite into
one of those cherry squirty ones

13:25.819 --> 13:26.939
when you're wearing a white blouse.

13:28.733 --> 13:30.464
Look, we didn't mean to insult you.

13:30.489 --> 13:32.614
You know, it's just how
we show appreciation.

13:32.639 --> 13:35.486
I mean, we kiss butt because we love.

13:35.511 --> 13:36.510
Yeah.

13:36.535 --> 13:37.697
Let's be honest,

13:37.722 --> 13:40.200
butt kissing makes the world go round.

13:40.537 --> 13:43.461
Everybody does it. I
kiss my clients' butts.

13:43.486 --> 13:45.230
My crew kisses my butt.

13:45.255 --> 13:47.259
Yeah, I mean, âWorld's
Greatest Teacherâ"

13:47.284 --> 13:48.995
You didn't buy that for yourself, right?

13:49.020 --> 13:50.457
Good point, honey.

13:50.482 --> 13:52.596
See, I just kissed my
wife's butt, she's not mad.

13:52.621 --> 13:55.221
No, I rather enjoyed it, yeah.

13:55.326 --> 13:57.554
Now, he's a very good butt kisser.

13:57.579 --> 13:58.256
Aw.

13:58.281 --> 14:00.407
Uh, no, he's not, he's terrible.

14:00.432 --> 14:02.516
He quit because of
Teacher Appreciation Day.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.647
That's the Super Bowl of butt kissing.

14:04.882 --> 14:06.001
Look, there are plenty of ways

14:06.026 --> 14:08.560
to get on my good side,
if you cared enough to try.

14:08.585 --> 14:11.305
Oh, whoa, hold on, that's unfair.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.754
No, I think I'm being perfectly fair.

14:12.779 --> 14:14.788
He's been working like a dog for you.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.032
Stay on track.

14:16.057 --> 14:18.241
I mean, he's up in the
middle of the night,

14:18.266 --> 14:19.437
he's here every day...

14:19.462 --> 14:20.637
He complains all the time

14:20.662 --> 14:22.790
about every little
thing I ask him to do.

14:22.815 --> 14:25.202
Okay, all right, why is
everybody standing up?

14:28.592 --> 14:29.640
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna let you

14:29.665 --> 14:31.160
talk about my husband that way.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.344
- If anything, I'm being easy on him.
- No, you're not.

14:33.369 --> 14:34.824
You're asking him to do too much.

14:34.849 --> 14:36.701
Well, maybe it seems like a
lot because I have to ask him

14:36.726 --> 14:38.410
to do everything three times.

14:38.436 --> 14:40.627
- Which is fine.
- It's not fine.

14:40.652 --> 14:42.779
He does the bare minimum at best.

14:42.804 --> 14:45.038
I ask him to make puppets,
all I got was attitude.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.305
I don't see any commitment.

14:46.307 --> 14:48.074
You know what? I don't think anybody

14:48.076 --> 14:49.742
could live up to your standards.

14:49.744 --> 14:51.177
- 'Cause you know what? You're...
- Easy.

14:51.179 --> 14:52.704
- You're...
- Careful.

14:53.868 --> 14:55.567
You're high maintenance.

14:55.953 --> 14:58.051
Better than I thought it would be.

14:59.154 --> 15:00.989
How's it going? Are they
getting Emme back in the class?

15:01.014 --> 15:02.922
I don't know, you keep talking.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.425
Uh-oh, angry footsteps.

15:05.427 --> 15:06.959
Angry footsteps.

15:10.683 --> 15:12.945
So, Adam, you back? What happened?

15:12.970 --> 15:15.137
Lady fight, big step backwards.

15:16.871 --> 15:19.683
And that's why you never do
stuff without asking your wife.

15:20.183 --> 15:22.852
I once made a decision
without consulting my wife.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.078
But then we got married anyway.

15:31.419 --> 15:32.785
- Hi, Andi.
- Hey, Don.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.128
Hey, honey.

15:34.153 --> 15:35.633
How was the rest of your
day? You feeling better?

15:35.658 --> 15:38.034
No, I mean, because I lost my temper,

15:38.059 --> 15:41.060
Emme's stuck in the
crummy kindergarten class.

15:41.062 --> 15:42.898
I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

15:42.923 --> 15:44.529
Or it could be the
difference between her being

15:44.554 --> 15:46.232
a Supreme Court justice, or a...

15:46.234 --> 15:48.401
cocktail waitress at an Indian casino.

15:49.070 --> 15:52.105
Hey, either way, she's
wearing a silly outfit.

15:52.609 --> 15:53.839
Well, I guess the good news is

15:53.864 --> 15:55.659
that you're not room
parent anymore, so...

15:55.684 --> 15:57.056
that's a win.

15:58.970 --> 16:01.681
Hey, you won.

16:03.118 --> 16:04.484
Savor this.

16:04.486 --> 16:05.877
I didn't win.

16:05.902 --> 16:07.268
Didn't you hear her tone?

16:07.355 --> 16:09.355
It's not how you say
it, it's what you say.

16:09.357 --> 16:13.726
Like, âShania Twain wants
to take a bath with you.â

16:13.924 --> 16:16.295
Sing it, scream it, cry it, either way

16:16.297 --> 16:18.431
I'm clean and happy.

16:19.660 --> 16:20.953
Why the bath?

16:20.978 --> 16:22.777
You know what? I don't care.

16:25.306 --> 16:27.273
I started this whole thing.

16:27.275 --> 16:30.309
I got to find a way
to win Rodriguez over.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.153
What would a captain do?

16:32.695 --> 16:34.413
Which reminds me...

16:34.415 --> 16:37.617
I got you something
that I think might help.

16:37.619 --> 16:39.819
Here you go, Captain.

16:42.524 --> 16:44.281
Yeah, yeah, I deserve that.

16:44.466 --> 16:46.165
Happy sailing!

16:46.427 --> 16:48.161
And just remember... even if you get

16:48.163 --> 16:50.309
through the Straits of
Forgiveness, some day,

16:50.334 --> 16:53.402
there's a torpedo heading your
way from the S.S. Menopause.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.382
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

17:02.849 --> 17:05.012
I think if you just
give Adam another chance,

17:05.038 --> 17:06.345
he won't disappoint you.

17:06.347 --> 17:08.564
He's already done a
lot personally for me.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.992
He's like... he's like my Phil Jackson.

17:11.017 --> 17:12.849
Sports reference. What's up?

17:13.675 --> 17:15.865
And I think the whole
class will miss him.

17:15.890 --> 17:17.290
Well, my decision hasn't changed

17:17.291 --> 17:19.392
since you asked me
through the bathroom door.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.403
What are you doing here?

17:25.428 --> 17:27.428
I bet I know exactly
what he's doing here.

17:34.611 --> 17:36.375
A puppet theater.

17:36.377 --> 17:38.778
Oh, I was way off.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.114
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

17:42.139 --> 17:44.677
No other room parent has
ever done anything like this.

17:44.702 --> 17:45.651
Did you build this?

17:45.653 --> 17:48.583
Yup. Happy Teacher Appreciation Day.

17:49.177 --> 17:52.558
I hope you'll consider letting
Emme back into your class, and,

17:52.560 --> 17:54.360
as you're making your decision,

17:54.362 --> 17:57.129
I'll ask you to press the
button on that little remote.

18:03.130 --> 18:05.330
Not just the bare minimum, right?

18:05.511 --> 18:06.502
Oh, wait a minute.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.581
Is this just a sophisticated
way of kissing my butt?

18:09.995 --> 18:12.042
- Well, I wouldn't call it that.
- 'Cause it's working.

18:12.067 --> 18:15.818
Oh. So, can Emme come
back to your class?

18:15.843 --> 18:19.125
Well, of course she can.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.270
And I haven't been able
to find a replacement

18:21.302 --> 18:23.769
so, maybe you could, you know...

18:23.794 --> 18:24.636
Just...

18:27.238 --> 18:28.785
Come back as room parent.

18:28.810 --> 18:30.643
It's happening.

18:32.724 --> 18:33.699
Okay, okay.

18:33.701 --> 18:35.195
- But I have a few conditions.
- No.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.178
- Well, just hear me out.
- No.

18:36.203 --> 18:37.879
- If we could just...
- No!

18:39.731 --> 18:41.607
- Okay. Deal.
- Good!

18:46.698 --> 18:49.749
Are we just gonna stand
here, or are we gonna hug?

18:51.448 --> 18:52.585
- We're just gonna stand here.
- We're just gonna stand here.

18:52.587 --> 18:53.897
Yeah.

18:56.641 --> 18:58.724
Nice job on the puppet theater, babe.

18:58.726 --> 19:00.565
I bet you knocked her socks off.

19:00.590 --> 19:02.900
Yeah. I just feel bad for the kids.

19:03.384 --> 19:05.641
They have to sit through
a puppet show now.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.644
I mean, you crashed our
ship into an iceberg,

19:09.669 --> 19:11.776
and then I panicked and start
throwing passengers overboard,

19:11.801 --> 19:13.775
but you just hopped
into your little tugboat

19:13.800 --> 19:16.240
and you got us back
on course. Toot, toot!

19:20.467 --> 19:22.648
You don't have to talk
to me like I'm a child.

19:23.274 --> 19:25.084
- I did do that, though.
- Yeah, you did.

19:26.170 --> 19:28.116
You know, it doesn't surprise
me, the fires you start,

19:28.141 --> 19:30.876
but it always surprises
me how you put 'em out.

19:31.511 --> 19:34.627
Hey, it's my job to do the
best I can for our family.

19:34.629 --> 19:36.729
Huh? That way, if the kids turn out bad,

19:36.731 --> 19:38.470
they can't blame it on us.

19:39.915 --> 19:41.179
I know this isn't what you're going for,

19:41.204 --> 19:45.006
but... I am really turned on right now.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.207
Baby, that's always what I'm going for.

19:59.943 --> 20:02.573
The time has come. Bon appétit, seńor.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.630
You know, I wasn't gonna make you

20:04.655 --> 20:06.651
really eat the ghost pepper if you lost.

20:06.676 --> 20:08.216
- Yes, you were.
- I know.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.623
Uh-huh.

20:10.648 --> 20:12.975
- How hot is this thing?
- It's pretty hot.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.655
They made me sign some
papers and watch a video

20:14.657 --> 20:16.257
before they let me take it.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.697
Okay, would you be willing
to exchange it for a spider?

20:18.722 --> 20:20.344
I'll munch a spider right now.

20:20.430 --> 20:21.606
I've already seen that.

20:23.429 --> 20:24.882
Okay, fine.

20:26.631 --> 20:28.428
Oh, you got a little
something on your eye there.

20:28.453 --> 20:31.272
- What?
- Yeah, right... yeah, right there, yeah.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.510
Aah! Okay. I knew you
were gonna do that!

20:35.959 --> 20:37.107
But then I forgot.

20:37.132 --> 20:39.666
Oh, God. Aah.
