00:47.256 --> 00:49.341
[female voice whispering]
<i>Gunmar...</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:52.469
<i>Gunmar the Black.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:54.638
[voice echoing]

00:56.390 --> 01:00.352
<i>Gunmar the Vicious.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:05.691
<i>Gunmar the Skullcrusher.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:09.361
<i>Gunmar!</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:11.863
[screaming]

01:11.947 --> 01:13.240
[groans]

01:13.323 --> 01:14.199
Ow!

01:14.283 --> 01:17.327
[groans, sighs]

01:17.411 --> 01:20.330
[students applauding, cheering]

01:21.957 --> 01:24.042
-Give me an A!
-[students] A!

01:24.126 --> 01:26.169
-Give me an R!
-R!

01:26.253 --> 01:28.463
-Give me a C!
-C!

01:28.547 --> 01:31.675
This is taking way too long.
Give me an "adia"!

01:31.758 --> 01:32.759
[confused chatter]

01:32.843 --> 01:34.261
What's that spell?

01:36.596 --> 01:39.099
[scoffs]
Arcadia!

01:39.182 --> 01:40.684
[students cheering]

01:40.767 --> 01:43.645
Go Moles! Go, Moles.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.647
Before we begin,
I have a few announcements.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.734
And his eye is glowing. And then,
the dream just keeps reminding me

01:48.817 --> 01:50.819
that I'm completely way out of my league.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.196
Right? Tobes.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.366
Who is that masked mole?
You ever wonder?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.703
You didn't hear a word I said
just then, did you?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.913
Sure, I did. You had no problems
sneaking into the Darklands

02:01.997 --> 02:03.165
when it was to save Claire's brother,

02:03.248 --> 02:05.167
but now that Kanjigar says
you've got to face Gunmar,

02:05.250 --> 02:06.793
you're having nightmares about him
and are freaking out

02:06.877 --> 02:08.294
that you're way out of your league.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.172
I can multi-task, Jimbo.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.424
[Jim]
It's Bill Aronstein.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.177
Bill moved to Wisconsin.
This is someone else's artistry.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.971
Someone with feminine wiles.

02:18.055 --> 02:22.100
What? What feminine wiles? How do you
even know that it's a girl under there?

02:22.184 --> 02:26.772
Uh, trust me, dude. I know women,
and that is all woman under there.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.448
[groans]
Hey! All right, mole, that's enough!

02:36.531 --> 02:38.617
Go back into your burrow or whatever!

02:38.700 --> 02:42.079
Okay. Principal Levit has
taken ill with the flu.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.581
He's asked me to handle
announcing the students

02:44.665 --> 02:49.086
the faculty's nominated for the year-end
Spring Fling King and Queen.

02:49.169 --> 02:54.424
The nominees are: Shannon Longhannon!
I'll pronounce it soon, Shannon.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.551
-It's gonna be you.
-No, it's not.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.846
-It is every year.
-And, every year, I don't care.

02:59.930 --> 03:04.309
-[Lawrence] Darci Scott!
-Wait, what? Really? Yeah!

03:04.393 --> 03:06.728
[Lawrence]
The third and final nominee is...

03:06.812 --> 03:08.188
Mary Wang!

03:08.271 --> 03:11.024
Me? Not you?
[laughs, cheers]

03:11.108 --> 03:15.278
-You? I mean, that's so awesome.
-[Lawrence] And now, for the boys...

03:15.362 --> 03:20.033
-Steve Palchuck!
-That's right, plebes! Obvious!

03:20.117 --> 03:23.161
I know, yeah. Get over here, Steve.
Eli Pepperjack!

03:23.245 --> 03:24.746
-[students boo]
-[Lawrence] Hey, no booing!

03:24.830 --> 03:26.373
I have friends!

03:26.456 --> 03:28.041
You're worrying too much about Gunmar.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.795
Relax, dude. Now that the play's over,
you can focus on your training full time.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.965
Learn some cool new moves,
master some deadly arts.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.926
And finally, Jim Lake Junior!

03:38.009 --> 03:40.637
-[gasps] That's you! [laughs]
-What?

03:40.721 --> 03:44.641
-Really? Buttsnack?
-Time for some friendly competition!

03:44.725 --> 03:48.478
Eat snack, Pepperjack!
[cackling]

03:48.562 --> 03:52.983
Our nominees will compete in a series
of challenges to win your vote.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.153
Each nominee will propose
a theme for the dance.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.906
I like disco! I've got to boogie!
That is all.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.452
-How am I gonna find time to--?
-That's not what's important, Jimbo!

04:03.535 --> 04:06.163
Here's what is: You've got a chance
to be king of the school!

04:06.246 --> 04:07.914
You know what that means?
[gasps]

04:07.998 --> 04:11.668
That would make me duke.
Jim Lake for Spring King!

04:11.752 --> 04:14.421
[male voice]
<i>You have defeated the son</i>

04:14.504 --> 04:16.757
<i>but not the father.</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:20.093
[female voice]
<i>Gunmar is death.</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:22.804
[grunting]

04:22.888 --> 04:24.723
[Kanjigar] <i>Blinkous and my son</i>
<i>have trained you well</i>

04:24.806 --> 04:26.808
<i>in the art of single combat,</i>

04:26.892 --> 04:31.605
<i>but rarely will your enemies</i>
<i>do the courtesy of striking one at a time.</i>

04:31.688 --> 04:34.441
-[sighs] All right, enough!
-[female voice] <i>So, you yield?</i>

04:34.524 --> 04:39.112
Yes, yeah, I yield. This stopped
being fun for me a little while ago.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.490
[Kanjigar]
<i>You must be prepared to face Gunmar.</i>

04:41.573 --> 04:42.783
Well...

04:42.866 --> 04:45.911
I think you guys just made
your point that I'm not.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.331
I'm not strong enough to kill Gunmar,
even with my friends.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.667
<i>We needed to be hard on you</i>
<i>because you weren't gonna listen to us.</i>

04:52.751 --> 04:54.461
<i>You had to see for yourself.</i>

04:54.544 --> 04:58.215
[female voice]
<i>Besides, there's no way to kill Gunmar.</i>

04:58.298 --> 04:59.925
[male voice]
<i>He's invincible.</i>

05:00.008 --> 05:03.094
-[male voice 2] <i>No, he's not!</i>
-[male voice] <i>So far as we know.</i>

05:03.178 --> 05:05.472
-[female voice] <i>What do you know?</i>
-What do they mean?

05:05.555 --> 05:11.186
<i>That sword of yours has fought him</i>
<i>many times, but has never killed him.</i>

05:11.269 --> 05:15.440
<i>Your weapon and armor were crafted</i>
<i>with a singular purpose in mind...</i>

05:15.524 --> 05:18.109
<i>to protect both our worlds.</i>

05:18.193 --> 05:22.030
<i>Don't forsake that solemn mission</i>
<i>to save one human child</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:24.533
<i>and lose your life in the process.</i>

05:29.913 --> 05:33.208
Jim, did you see my father?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.585
I did.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.799
Did he speak of me?

05:40.882 --> 05:43.301
Yeah. He wished
the Soothscryer could let you in,

05:43.385 --> 05:45.637
but, you know, the rules are the rules.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.139
[sighs]
It's all right, Trollhunter.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.350
You don't have to lie
to protect my feelings.

05:51.226 --> 05:56.022
He said we can't kill Gunmar. I would only
be leading my friends to their death.

05:56.106 --> 06:00.485
Too bad. I was looking forward
to proving him wrong.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.196
[chuckles]
So was I.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.198
-Aaarrrgghh, what's wrong?
-Blinky.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.576
But if I consult Gringold's Grimore,

06:07.659 --> 06:09.619
cross-reference it
with Axle's Forbidden Almanac--

06:09.703 --> 06:12.122
Of course, it's there! It's true!
[laughing]

06:12.205 --> 06:14.916
-How long's he been like this?
-Long time.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.836
-Maybe you should switch to decaf.
-According to legend,

06:17.919 --> 06:22.799
only one scholar, the Dishonorable Bodus,
uncovered a method of wounding Gunmar.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.386
The Trollhunters just told me
there wasn't any way. How do you do it?

06:26.469 --> 06:29.264
No one knows.
Gunmar had Bodus and his students

06:29.347 --> 06:32.100
hunted down and dispatched
in a most unpleasant manner.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.645
But here, this book,
<i>The Final Testament of Bodus--</i>

06:35.729 --> 06:41.192
This is the last surviving copy
of his work! This is the key!

06:42.193 --> 06:43.612
And I'm going to burn it.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.031
-[all gasp]
-Long time.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.911
Blinky, no! What are you doing?
That book might tell us the--

06:51.995 --> 06:54.789
Bodus was being hunted!
He knew he had to keep it secret!

06:54.873 --> 06:57.292
-Oh, no! [grunts]
-[blowing]

06:58.209 --> 07:01.838
-Burn, baby, burn!
-No, don't!

07:01.921 --> 07:04.758
Did Blinky just destroy
our only chance at getting Gunmar?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.260
-Or my baby brother!
-You don't understand.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.889
Bodus hid the secret
<i>within</i> the book. Watch.

07:14.893 --> 07:15.977
[Claire]
It's a message.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.312
Aha!

07:17.395 --> 07:19.898
-I am so glad that worked.
-What does it say?

07:19.981 --> 07:23.026
"In darkest tide,
when Daylight darest wane,

07:23.109 --> 07:26.237
the Myrddin Wylt obscured
a Shadow's bane."

07:26.321 --> 07:28.573
-What's a "Myrddin Wench"?
-It's an ancient name for Merlin.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.784
Shouldn't someone be taking
a picture of this or something?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.994
"Three forces elemental thou must seek.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.331
In marshland, caverns deep,
and mountain's peak.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.376
Where worthy perish,
ye will prevail in night

07:39.459 --> 07:42.420
and eclipse all who quarry
with thy might."

07:42.504 --> 07:44.923
Anyone else freaked out a little bit
by this evil perish poem?

07:45.006 --> 07:50.178
No. It said we can prevail!
We can win! He hid a Shadow's bane.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.554
Gunmar's bane?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.974
It's referencing
a weapon of insurmountable power,

07:54.057 --> 07:57.102
formed by three forces unhallowed...

07:57.185 --> 07:59.813
Of course!
It must be the Triumbric Stones!

07:59.896 --> 08:03.483
Three shards of legend tied
to Gunmar's lifeblood, lost to the ages.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.778
-If we seek out these stones--
-We can kill Gunmar!

08:06.861 --> 08:09.614
Blinky, you madman, you did it!

08:09.698 --> 08:13.952
We make the weapon and wham!
Gunmar is done-mar!

08:14.035 --> 08:14.995
Caution.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.789
Indeed! The Triumbric Stones
have been hidden for centuries,

08:17.872 --> 08:21.584
but if I can decipher this text,
Master Jim, then you shall--

08:21.668 --> 08:23.878
"Eclipse all who quarry with thy might."

08:26.715 --> 08:29.050
[snarling]

08:29.134 --> 08:31.928
-[soft romantic music playing on radio]
-[laughs, sighs]

08:32.011 --> 08:34.347
[grunting]

08:34.431 --> 08:35.265
[sighs]

08:35.807 --> 08:39.309
This is what the world
has become, Angor Rot.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.020
This village...

08:41.104 --> 08:45.233
-It's called "Arcadia Oaks."
-It's on fire?

08:45.316 --> 08:49.070
No. Those are called lights.
Something known as electricity.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.115
You'll come to enjoy it,
along with indoor plumbing.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.827
So many advances since you've been away.

08:55.910 --> 09:01.041
The bridge to Gunmar
is under this... Arcadia?

09:01.124 --> 09:05.295
The bridge will be spoken of no longer.
Gunmar had his chance to rule.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.965
-Now, it's my turn.
-Your turn for what?

09:09.049 --> 09:12.135
Revenge and insurance.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.678
[grunts]

09:14.220 --> 09:15.805
[snarling]

09:15.889 --> 09:19.893
In this town, there is a boy
and this boy fancies a girl,

09:19.976 --> 09:22.979
a girl whose brother
is being held in the Darklands.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.066
If the boy saves the child
from the changeling nursery,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.401
he'll want to save them all.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.237
And it's my job to watch
over my half-breed brethren

09:31.321 --> 09:33.031
and not let that happen.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.993
But how could a fleshbag
even contemplate such a feat?

09:37.077 --> 09:41.998
This boy is the Trollhunter.
It's a long story.

09:42.082 --> 09:46.211
The moral of which
is not to underestimate him.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.880
He already managed to kill
the son of Gunmar.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.049
Obviously, I could deal with him myself,

09:51.132 --> 09:54.969
but a man of my esteemed stature
in this community can't do anything

09:55.053 --> 09:56.846
without arousing unwanted suspicion.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.767
You're afraid of a fleshbag child.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.602
I am not. I merely--

10:02.685 --> 10:07.899
He bested Bular and you are afraid.

10:07.982 --> 10:13.196
That is why you require Angor Rot.

10:13.279 --> 10:19.577
Just remember who's in charge here.
I bear the ring. You answer to me.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.705
When the boy is finished,
you will have your freedom.

10:22.789 --> 10:27.460
A human Trollhunter...
I've never hunted such game.

10:27.544 --> 10:32.549
I will kill this boy,
but I will do it on my own terms.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.095
[goblin laughing]

10:37.178 --> 10:42.016
I'm back, Arcadia,
and I brought you a gift.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.561
[baby crying]

10:44.644 --> 10:45.645
Mom, could you--?

10:45.728 --> 10:49.566
[Claire's mom] Claire, could you change
your baby brother's diaper, please?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.986
[to herself]
He's not a baby and he's not my brother.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.196
[crying]

10:58.408 --> 11:00.660
Finally, the help shows up.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.746
If you think for a second
I'm changing your diaper--

11:03.830 --> 11:08.459
Please, I'm more than capable
of using the loo like a civilized troll.

11:08.543 --> 11:12.881
I need you to pick me up
a nice, thick, greasy cheeseburger,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.300
with a side of jo-jo potatoes.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.469
What do I look like? Your servant?

11:18.553 --> 11:19.470
[clears throat]

11:19.554 --> 11:21.264
[cries loudly]

11:21.347 --> 11:24.392
All right, enough!
You're a monster. You know that?

11:24.475 --> 11:27.437
Uh, not monster. Changeling.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.900
This isn't fair.

11:31.983 --> 11:35.737
It's no day at the beach
for me either, love bug.

11:35.820 --> 11:40.283
I can't believe I have to pretend
you're my brother. It's... It's cruel.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.786
What's this?
Don't... Don't do that, seriously.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.749
Please don't cry. Forget the jo-jos.
Just a plain burger. [chuckles]

11:47.832 --> 11:49.417
Enrique...

11:50.501 --> 11:54.797
I get it. You miss your brother,
but I assure you, he's perfectly fine.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.384
He's trapped in the Darklands.
How can that be fine?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.678
I'll show ya.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.682
[gathering spit, mumbling]

12:05.600 --> 12:08.937
Your brother is what's known
as my familiar.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.606
Changelings share
a certain bond with them.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.858
It's good for this little trick.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.071
[gasps, sighs]

12:18.154 --> 12:19.906
Enrique...

12:20.990 --> 12:22.158
<i>Mi hermanito.</i>

12:25.078 --> 12:29.582
I suppose this arrangement
has been rather hard on you.

12:29.666 --> 12:34.545
I'm going to get you back. I'm going
to find you and I'll bring you home.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.966
[muttering]

12:38.049 --> 12:41.719
Sorry. It's "for a limited time only"
kinda situation.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.930
You don't have to leave.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.977
-How do you like your burger?
-Yum!

12:49.060 --> 12:50.395
[doorbell rings]

12:51.437 --> 12:53.773
Ah, Mr. Strickler.
[sneezes]

12:53.856 --> 12:56.109
-You're back?
-Gesundheit, Principal Levit.

12:56.192 --> 13:01.155
My apologies if my absence caused you
any turmoil, but I brought you a gift.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.532
Oh, come in.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.660
-What is it? Some sort of rock?
-Of a sort.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.872
I hear Coach Lawrence was having
a tizzy of a time teaching my class.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.001
<i>Your</i> class? Look, you can't
just drop off the face of the Earth

13:13.084 --> 13:14.252
and expect your job back.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.964
Actually, it's not my job I'm here for.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.090
What is this?

13:19.173 --> 13:21.759
[screaming]

13:21.843 --> 13:23.594
[grunting]

13:23.678 --> 13:25.930
And now, for my next trick...

13:26.014 --> 13:27.640
the vanishing sock!

13:29.976 --> 13:32.145
Mm! Tasty trick.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.732
It's not supposed to be tasty, Aaarrrgghh.
It's supposed to be magic.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.111
[both continue speaking indistinctly]

13:40.194 --> 13:42.113
[engine running]

13:54.500 --> 13:56.461
-Hey, Mom. I'm home.
-Where have you been?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.213
Just studying at the library
with Claire and Tobes.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.508
The library closed three hours ago.
Where have you been?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.761
I don't know, Mom.
We took the long way home.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.347
I have been worried sick, and that's
the best lie you can come up with?

14:08.431 --> 14:12.810
Okay, sorry! Call off the search parties!

14:12.894 --> 14:15.063
I'm obviously home!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
[door opens, slams closed]

14:41.047 --> 14:42.840
Hmm...

14:47.970 --> 14:50.515
-[woman speaking indistinctly]
-[school bell rings]

14:50.598 --> 14:53.059
Jim, this is what you're wearing?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.270
I wear this every day, Tobes.
What else would I be wearing?

14:56.354 --> 14:57.688
Your costume!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.190
[takes deep breath]

14:59.273 --> 15:02.235
In a few minutes, you're selling everyone
your theme for the school dance.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.779
Tobes, look, I'd love to be Spring King.
Who wouldn't?

15:04.862 --> 15:09.450
But I'm just a little preoccupied
right now with not getting killed.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.577
There are fates worse than death, Jimbo.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.204
[yelps]

15:13.287 --> 15:14.580
In high school, anyway.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.876
This is our chance to get the school
to finally recognize how cool we are.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.711
-"We"?
-If you become Spring King,

15:20.795 --> 15:22.922
it'll open up a whole
new bracket of women.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.383
I'm talking cheerleaders,
senior cheerleaders--

15:25.466 --> 15:29.303
[gasps] Dare I dream?
Community college dropouts.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.555
[giggles, grunts]

15:30.638 --> 15:33.933
If you don't want to do it for us,
Jimbo, do it for me.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.185
I've always felt
like I was destined to be a duke.

15:36.853 --> 15:40.690
Fine. I'll try to throw
some kind of costume together, okay?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.775
Thank you. And put some effort into it.

16:03.129 --> 16:07.842
Ugh! The things I do for Toby.
Where am I supposed to find a costume?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.928
And what am I supposed to be?
Stapler-man?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.013
Huh?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.307
What is that?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.729
[Lawrence over PA]
<i>Attention, teachers and students!</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:21.856
<i>The assembly will begin in two minutes!</i>

16:21.939 --> 16:24.567
<i>-One fifty-nine, fifty-eight. Move it!</i>
-Huh.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.492
Huh.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.163
[rumbling]

16:43.544 --> 16:47.215
And now, for the boys, Steve Palchuck!

16:47.632 --> 16:51.219
Arcadia Oaks High,
I have two words for you.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.765
[chanting]
Luau! Luau! Luau!

16:55.848 --> 16:59.560
[students chanting]
Luau! Luau! Luau!

16:59.644 --> 17:03.606
Yeah! Pineapples! Leis! Coconuts?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.608
Thanks, Palchuck.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.858
Hey, Toby, where's Jim?

17:06.943 --> 17:09.487
Oh, he's just throwing together
a last-minute costume and theme.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.155
-No big deal.
-What is he thinking?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.365
These things take time.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.825
You don't just win Spring Fling
by throwing something together.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.954
-Why do I care about this so much?
-Because it matters, Claire!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.790
This is the kind of event
that can propel us through high school

17:20.873 --> 17:23.251
and send us off to college as winners!

17:23.334 --> 17:25.336
[suspenseful music playing]

17:27.380 --> 17:31.592
Um, hi. I know that we just met,
but what are you?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.427
[grunts, screams]

17:33.803 --> 17:37.807
Okay. All right, I get it.
Strong, silent type.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.226
[grunting, screaming]

17:40.309 --> 17:43.396
[Lawrence]
And now, Eli Pepperjack!

17:46.107 --> 17:49.110
[retro dance music playing]

17:49.193 --> 17:51.612
-[students murmuring]
-[girl] Oh, my God!

17:51.696 --> 17:53.322
[girl 2]
Uh, awkward.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.787
-What's up, righteous dudes and dudettes?
-Huh?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.873
Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters!

18:02.957 --> 18:06.168
Let's take a blast to the past!

18:06.252 --> 18:09.463
Back to ancient times!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.967
The 1980s!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.470
-[music stops]
-[lone clapping]

18:16.554 --> 18:20.057
Boo! Go back to the luau guy!

18:20.141 --> 18:22.268
Okay, if you're gonna play dirty--

18:22.351 --> 18:24.854
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

18:26.564 --> 18:28.399
[yelling]

18:28.482 --> 18:29.859
[grunts]

18:29.942 --> 18:32.194
That wasn't supposed to happen!

18:32.278 --> 18:33.195
[screams]

18:33.821 --> 18:36.324
[screaming]

18:36.407 --> 18:37.241
Or that.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.619
[continues screaming]

18:40.286 --> 18:43.372
[grunting, yelling]

18:43.456 --> 18:48.502
I resurrected you to kill the Trollhunter,
not outsource the job to a golem.

18:48.586 --> 18:54.592
He bested the son of Gunmar. Human or not,
this hunter is not to be trifled with.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.886
The hunt is a game,

18:56.969 --> 19:02.183
and when I'm prepared to strike,
he will know.

19:02.266 --> 19:06.228
Mr. Lake? Anybody seen Mr. Lake?
Well, I guess you forfeit--

19:06.312 --> 19:07.605
-Hey, there!
-Jim will be here.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.317
-We're his opening act.
-Who wants to see some magic?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.737
[grunting]

19:41.639 --> 19:42.973
[grunts, yells]

Whew!

20:16.757 --> 20:18.509
Hmm...

20:23.889 --> 20:26.392
[Lawrence over PA]
<i>James Lake? Lake, are you here?</i>

20:26.475 --> 20:29.311
Oh, no! The costume!
[yelps]

20:29.395 --> 20:31.439
-Okay, this is gonna work.
-[boy] Boo!

20:32.064 --> 20:34.358
-Boo!
-[gasps] Oh, my gosh! It worked!

20:34.442 --> 20:37.278
-Wait, where'd the sock go?
<i>-♪ Oh, say, can you see? ♪</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.363
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of my act.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.283
<i>-♪ By the dawn's ear-- ♪</i>
-Give me the-- All right, enough!

20:42.366 --> 20:43.701
Jim Lake is disquali--

20:44.910 --> 20:46.537
-[students gasp]
-[gasps] What the heck is that?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.372
[students murmuring]

20:48.456 --> 20:50.082
What's going on here?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.710
Looks like you've been
digging in the dirt, Lake.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.839
-What the heck are you supposed to be?
-He looks like a mole!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.466
[both]
Huh?

20:58.549 --> 21:03.554
-[chanting] Mole! Mole! Mole!
-No, no, no! I'm not a mole! I'm just--

21:03.637 --> 21:04.764
[chanting continues]

21:04.847 --> 21:07.224
Jim Lake Junior...

21:07.308 --> 21:09.101
here to present his theme...

21:09.185 --> 21:10.853
Mole Mania!

21:10.936 --> 21:12.521
[students cheering]

21:16.859 --> 21:19.111
Mole Mania is not even a theme!

21:19.945 --> 21:22.740
The people have spoken.
Jim is the winner!

21:22.823 --> 21:27.745
Oh, apparently, Claire's the queen.
But, yes, Jim wins the challenge!

21:27.828 --> 21:32.917
Mole Mania is the theme, but if I see
one drop of mud on my gymnasium floor--

21:33.751 --> 21:35.169
Just dress like normal!

21:35.252 --> 21:39.048
At any rate-- [clears throat]
there has been a sudden departure.

21:39.131 --> 21:44.011
I have heard word that Principal Levit
has taken an indefinite leave of absence.

21:44.094 --> 21:49.058
We wish him well. But he sent an e-mail
recommending an interim replacement,

21:49.141 --> 21:50.768
which we all support.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.979
Please welcome Principal Strickler!

21:54.063 --> 21:57.107
-[clapping]
-[Eli] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

21:57.191 --> 21:58.984
[students murmuring]

21:59.068 --> 22:01.320
What is he doing here?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.072
I thought you said he would be a fool
to ever come back.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.744
I'm very glad to be back
and excited to get started.

22:08.828 --> 22:15.209
But let it be known, with me in charge,
things are going to change.
