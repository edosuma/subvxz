<i>We've got a homicide,
possibly gang-related.</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:44.727
<i>York Hotel.</i>

00:44.810 --> 00:46.643
<i>Yeah, copy that, Control. 10-4.</i>

00:51.560 --> 00:53.310
York Hotel, as quick as you can.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.310
Thanks, sweetie.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.560
Hey, Frank, how about a freebie?

01:30.852 --> 01:31.977
Thanks.

02:22.477 --> 02:24.517
- Detective Crankovich.
- Sorry, Detective...?

02:24.560 --> 02:27.602
Mankovich. Frank.
Frank Mankovich. Detective.

02:27.685 --> 02:30.018
Don't let anybody through,
especially the press.

02:33.435 --> 02:35.393
- Detective Hankovich.
- Detective.

02:35.477 --> 02:39.393
Hey, we're part of the investigation.
Detective Frank Wankovich.

02:39.477 --> 02:42.143
Detective Claire Lady.
What happened here?

02:42.227 --> 02:44.268
I already told
all your colleagues everything.

02:44.352 --> 02:45.768
Well, you can tell me again, then.

02:47.185 --> 02:50.768
Well, I was by reception and a man
came in, and he was wearing a helmet

02:50.852 --> 02:53.143
and he had a gun with a silencer.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.893
Mm-hm. And then?

02:56.477 --> 02:59.768
Well, he pointed the gun at Mr. Ivanov

02:59.852 --> 03:02.602
and shouted something in Russian, I think.

03:03.935 --> 03:04.810
Then he shot him.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.768
- What did he look like?
- Bonneville.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.060
Superintendent.

03:11.893 --> 03:14.018
I'm not disturbing you,
I hope, Bonneville?

03:14.102 --> 03:15.268
Oh. Not at all.

03:16.102 --> 03:18.727
Oh. Claire Maddox,
Perry, head of homicide.

03:18.810 --> 03:21.727
- Hi.
- Get out of here. Both of you.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.685
Right now. Or I'll slap you in custody.

03:24.768 --> 03:28.102
- Wait, you're not a detective?
- No.

03:28.185 --> 03:31.393
My name is Frank, though.
This wasn't all a lie.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.143
We had some good times, right?

03:37.102 --> 03:40.602
- Detective, a comment, please?
- Okay, let them through.

03:41.310 --> 03:44.227
- Hey. What? What are you doing?
- He said let them through.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.185
- You don't let anybody through.
- Oh.

03:50.602 --> 03:51.935
Oh, I've gotta go, darling.

03:52.018 --> 03:54.060
- Get me the control room.
- They're on.

03:55.310 --> 03:57.852
- Hey.
<i>- So, you got a story, Frank?</i>

03:58.477 --> 04:00.352
"Russian Mafia Wars."
How's that sound?

04:01.060 --> 04:03.768
<i>Okay. Let's do it now.</i>

04:03.852 --> 04:07.352
<i>Standing by. And you're on.</i>

04:07.852 --> 04:11.727
At 8:45, Sergei Ivanov,
a.k.a. Three Fingers,

04:11.810 --> 04:14.685
a figure in the Russian Mafia,
left his room at the York Hotel.

04:14.768 --> 04:19.142
He'd just breakfasted on eggs, toast,
and a black coffee. His last breakfast.

04:20.101 --> 04:23.768
The sumptuous lifestyle
and escapades of Sergei Ivanov,

04:23.852 --> 04:26.768
mover and shaker in the nightclubs
of Manhattan and New Jersey...

04:26.852 --> 04:29.435
Two minutes in the hotel
and he comes out with a story.

04:29.518 --> 04:35.310
- A true artist. He's the best.
- He's certainly the best at what he does.

04:36.477 --> 04:41.227
...a war that has only just begun.
This is Frank Bonneville, 365 News.

04:43.727 --> 04:44.810
That was great.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.352
- You need any help?
- No, I'm fine. Won't be a minute.

04:55.518 --> 04:56.643
"Darling."

04:57.268 --> 05:00.102
- Who was that, then, your girlfriend?
- I'm married.

05:01.393 --> 05:03.018
Ah.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.768
So, it's his wife.

05:04.852 --> 05:07.768
- Yeah.
- Eh! He's a player.

05:07.852 --> 05:09.612
Aren't you, Finch? Huh?

05:09.685 --> 05:11.477
- Chick in every port?
- Nah.

05:29.727 --> 05:30.768
Oh.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.120
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

05:37.185 --> 05:38.393
You want a coffee?

05:38.477 --> 05:41.310
Yeah, can I get a skim-milk latte?

05:41.393 --> 05:43.977
- You on a diet?
- A bit, yeah.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.602
I had a medical,
and apparently I'm 25 percent fat.

05:46.685 --> 05:49.977
- Is that bad?
- Yeah. It's more than some snacks.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.560
Ooh!

05:52.643 --> 05:55.102
- Okay.
- See you later.

06:06.977 --> 06:08.227
There he is.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.227
Huh?

06:11.310 --> 06:12.893
Look at you.

06:12.977 --> 06:16.060
First reporter with the story, again.

06:16.852 --> 06:18.685
All other journalists
banned from the site.

06:19.643 --> 06:20.643
Ha!

06:21.935 --> 06:24.602
Oh, no, wait. What are these?

06:25.518 --> 06:29.810
"Impersonating an officer."
"Tampering with a crime scene."

06:29.893 --> 06:32.143
- I got results.
- You're not Dirty Harry!

06:34.102 --> 06:37.935
At best, you're an underachiever
at a local radio station.

06:38.018 --> 06:39.852
Often, a drunk underachiever.

06:39.935 --> 06:43.102
- Would you rather I didn't get the story?
- Than break the law? Yeah.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.268
Why break the law? Plenty of news
without having to break the law.

06:46.352 --> 06:48.810
If you run out,
make up a story about a lost dog.

06:48.893 --> 06:50.852
I made up a story
about being a detective.

06:50.935 --> 06:55.102
One more slip-up and you're fired.
This is coming from upstairs, not from me.

06:55.185 --> 06:57.560
They've had it.
They don't need this anymore.

06:57.643 --> 07:01.143
You're an arrogant, selfish hack
who survives

07:01.227 --> 07:03.643
because everyone thinks
you're a local celebrity.

07:04.352 --> 07:06.518
I can't fire you
because I don't like you.

07:06.602 --> 07:09.060
But I can fire you if you break the law

07:09.143 --> 07:13.310
or for the next thing you do
that breaks the rules.

07:13.393 --> 07:17.060
I so much as find out you used
a disabled toilet, goodbye.

07:17.143 --> 07:20.060
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

07:20.143 --> 07:22.643
Go ahead, punk, make my day.

07:29.602 --> 07:31.852
- Will there be any celebrities?
- The girl who reads the weather

07:31.935 --> 07:33.560
- knows Al Roker.
- Will he be here?

07:33.643 --> 07:35.268
No. She might, though.

07:35.352 --> 07:37.893
Hey, Sacha.
This is my wife, Eleanor.

07:37.977 --> 07:39.643
- Oh, finally. Hi.
- Hi.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.268
- Many in?
- Uh, no. No, you're the first.

07:42.352 --> 07:43.685
- Someone has to be.
- Exactly.

07:43.768 --> 07:45.935
And it's nice to be here in time
to see the staff prepare

07:46.018 --> 07:47.477
for such a prestigious event.

07:49.727 --> 07:51.685
See you later. Okay, let's get in.

07:52.727 --> 07:54.268
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:54.352 --> 07:56.477
Hi.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.018
- Balloons.
- It's still sunny out.

07:59.102 --> 08:00.643
Well, it's nearly July, isn't it?

08:00.727 --> 08:03.560
- Doesn't get dark till 9:00.
- Imagine going out in the darkness.

08:03.643 --> 08:07.060
- You're the first here.
- Yeah, he doesn't like to be late.

08:07.143 --> 08:09.518
- Champagne?
- Don't mind if I do.

08:11.227 --> 08:12.852
There you go. Ah.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.268
Mm.

08:19.393 --> 08:22.560
So, what do you think
of my little radio station event?

08:22.643 --> 08:25.977
Well, I mean, if it was really your
radio station, it would be something.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.602
Well, I'm chief sound engineer.

08:28.685 --> 08:31.143
And if you consider
that radio is just sound,

08:31.227 --> 08:32.893
I'm sort of chief engineer, really.

08:32.977 --> 08:36.434
In one of the biggest
local radio stations around. Locally.

08:36.518 --> 08:39.018
It's just not what I thought
you'd still be doing at 50.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.768
- What do you mean?
- Radio.

08:42.227 --> 08:43.977
- Radio is like...
- It's what I love.

08:44.059 --> 08:45.518
Yeah, but it's just not very exciting.

08:45.602 --> 08:48.227
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking. But go on, tell me.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.935
What is the most exciting thing
that's happened this week?

08:51.018 --> 08:53.102
- Okay. Um...
- Okay.

08:53.185 --> 08:54.852
- Well, you decide.
- Okay.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.685
Is it that our omnibus podcast
just made top 50 on iTunes?

08:58.768 --> 08:59.643
Ooh.

08:59.727 --> 09:02.935
Or, is it that Jamie Oliver
popped in yesterday

09:03.018 --> 09:05.352
- to talk to Stig Arnold about fat kids?
- Is he gonna be here?

09:05.435 --> 09:09.310
- Stig's never missed a party yet. Heh.
- I meant Jamie Oliver.

09:09.393 --> 09:10.393
Who knows?

09:10.477 --> 09:12.852
- So, no, then?
- No. Definitely not.

09:14.143 --> 09:16.018
You meet Stig.

09:16.102 --> 09:18.685
You won't want to see Jamie Oliver
after you've met Stig.

09:22.185 --> 09:23.352
Sorry.

09:26.102 --> 09:28.852
Haven't you ever wanted to do
something extraordinary?

09:30.602 --> 09:32.643
- Finch.
- Hi.

09:32.727 --> 09:35.977
Um, this is Geoffrey Mallard,
the radio boss.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.643
- This is my wife, Eleanor.
- Pleasure to meet you.

09:38.727 --> 09:41.685
I've been looking for you.
Some lunatic took his family hostage.

09:41.768 --> 09:44.185
He's armed. I need you and Claire
to go and cover it.

09:44.268 --> 09:45.852
- Now?
- Yeah, I don't have a choice.

09:45.935 --> 09:47.727
You're the only guy around.

09:47.810 --> 09:50.768
- Where is Claire?
- She's on her way here. Nice to meet you.

09:50.852 --> 09:52.560
Okay, I'm so sorry, darling.

09:52.643 --> 09:55.310
No, no, no, you're not leaving me here.
I don't know anyone.

09:55.393 --> 09:58.268
I don't have a choice. He said
I'm the only guy that can do this.

09:58.352 --> 10:00.893
- He said you're the only guy around.
- He didn't literally mean

10:00.977 --> 10:04.393
I'm the only guy around. He meant
I'm the only guy around that can do this.

10:04.477 --> 10:06.677
- He's around, he couldn't do it.
- You don't know that.

10:06.727 --> 10:09.727
- Oh, come on. Look at him.
- You can't do this to me. Come on.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.185
- Shh.
- "Shh!"

10:11.268 --> 10:13.102
No. You know what? Forget it.
I'm going home.

10:13.185 --> 10:17.477
Please don't. Don't, please.
Just wait here and enjoy yourself

10:17.560 --> 10:19.727
and I'll whiz back,
and then we'll have a...

10:19.810 --> 10:21.977
- You're gonna be gone for hours.
- No.

10:22.060 --> 10:25.852
In these situations the police usually get
the gunman to the window really quickly

10:25.935 --> 10:29.102
and shoot him through the top lip,
and that takes out the brain stem,

10:29.185 --> 10:31.602
so there's no reflex... action.

10:34.477 --> 10:36.310
- Hi.
- Did you see Mallard?

10:36.393 --> 10:39.893
Yeah. Oh, uh, this is Claire Maddox.
This is my wife, Eleanor.

10:39.977 --> 10:42.560
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.393
- We should go.
- Yeah.

10:47.018 --> 10:48.477
- See you in the lobby.
- Yeah, okay.

10:51.352 --> 10:53.852
Who's this? Is this Tony?
Look at this guy.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.352
- Anyway...
- How are you?

10:57.435 --> 10:59.185
- I've gotta go.
- Okay, fine, go.

10:59.268 --> 11:01.227
- Yeah?
- Whatever.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.310
You'll be all right?

11:02.352 --> 11:05.310
- I'll see you soon. Okay.
- Okay, go if you're gonna go.

11:15.602 --> 11:18.227
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey.

11:28.852 --> 11:30.310
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:35.268 --> 11:39.352
Did you see Frank arrive,
acting like he thinks he's James Bond?

11:39.435 --> 11:42.352
Yeah. I think he's really cool.
He doesn't care about anything.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.185
Oh.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.060
- How is that cool?
- Hi.

11:46.143 --> 11:47.393
- Hi.
- Oh...

11:49.102 --> 11:50.435
I don't know, I just...

11:51.435 --> 11:53.352
I just mean...

11:53.435 --> 11:57.810
I think it would be cool to be
like that sometimes, you know?

11:57.893 --> 12:00.768
I care about everything,
and I try my best,

12:00.852 --> 12:05.477
but nothing much seems to happen.
It's because I'm boring.

12:06.352 --> 12:08.227
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's true.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.393
I... I've never done
anything extraordinary.

12:12.185 --> 12:13.935
I think that's why I play video games.

12:14.018 --> 12:16.018
Because they're more interesting
than my real life.

12:17.893 --> 12:19.935
- <i>Rebel Coup?</i>
- Yeah. Do you play?

12:20.602 --> 12:23.060
- I'm trying to cut down.
- Yeah, me, too.

12:24.518 --> 12:27.018
- Take that, sucker.
- Nice move.

12:27.977 --> 12:30.018
Mr. Bonneville. I love your work.

12:30.102 --> 12:33.352
- Champagne?
- Thank you. Cheers.

12:34.352 --> 12:37.143
You're the Frank Bonneville?

12:37.977 --> 12:40.143
- Apparently.
- I listen to you every day.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.643
- Really?
- I wouldn't miss it.

12:44.477 --> 12:46.435
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.435
Mm.

12:55.268 --> 12:56.435
Alone?

12:59.893 --> 13:01.685
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.852
It's a lonely life, radio.

13:04.935 --> 13:08.102
- Tell me about it.
- It's so unglamorous.

13:08.185 --> 13:11.227
Yes, I know.
I was just saying that to my... self.

13:12.268 --> 13:14.977
Let me guess. PR.

13:16.602 --> 13:19.352
Yes. Yes. How did you know?

13:19.435 --> 13:22.852
Well, come on. You're too attractive
for Human Resources.

13:22.935 --> 13:27.685
- And not bitter enough for management.
- That's nice. I'm flattered.

13:27.768 --> 13:30.185
Why radio? Why not TV
or something more stimulating?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.352
- It's what I love.
- Cheers.

13:32.435 --> 13:34.727
- It's what I hate.
- No. Come on.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.768
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are so good at it.

13:36.852 --> 13:38.602
- Like, you exude passion.
- No.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.445
- It really comes across.
- That's not passion.

13:40.518 --> 13:41.893
- Yeah.
- That's frustration.

13:42.977 --> 13:45.393
I'm destined for bigger things,
and I know it.

13:45.477 --> 13:49.852
So, in the meantime, it's just like
I'm a big fish in a little pond.

13:49.935 --> 13:53.018
- Yeah.
- A big... angry fish.

13:53.102 --> 13:58.102
- Yeah.
- Big, drunk, angry fish, in a tiny,

13:58.185 --> 14:00.727
- shitty little pond.
- No. You know what?

14:01.268 --> 14:04.227
- At least you're honest about it.
- Where's that got me? Nowhere.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.185
No more "Mr. Nice Guy," you know?
Here's to cheating.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.602
It sounds like you're right
in my ear, whispering sweet nothings.

14:17.685 --> 14:19.977
- It really does.
- Resonance is better if I hold the mic...

14:20.060 --> 14:22.185
Excuse me, hold on.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.977
- Nothing serious?
- Nothing serious.

14:35.060 --> 14:37.352
Let me ask you two questions.
First question:

14:37.435 --> 14:39.810
- Was that from your boyfriend?
- I don't have a boyfriend.

14:39.893 --> 14:43.102
- Second question: You live near here?
- About five minutes.

14:43.185 --> 14:44.227
Wanna go there now?

14:47.685 --> 14:51.810
Why did you ask how far it was
before you invited yourself back?

14:52.352 --> 14:55.643
If it had been a bit further away,
would that have been a deal breaker?

14:55.727 --> 14:57.935
Like, five minutes, "Yeah, sure."

14:58.018 --> 15:00.477
Half-hour, "Yeah, forget it,
it's too much of a hassle."

15:01.018 --> 15:03.643
- No. Wait, what?
- Forget it. Come on.

15:04.102 --> 15:06.268
Let's make a move
so you don't waste too much time.

15:22.227 --> 15:24.268
- Drink?
- Yeah, sure.

15:39.477 --> 15:41.852
Thanks. Good night. It was fun.

15:45.727 --> 15:49.185
Do you want my number,
or should I take yours?

15:49.268 --> 15:50.352
I don't think so.

15:51.102 --> 15:53.060
- You're married, right?
- How did you know?

15:53.143 --> 15:57.393
Call it intuition, but not many women
collect superhero toys.

15:57.852 --> 16:00.893
Apparently, they're not toys.
They are "collectibles."

16:00.977 --> 16:02.143
Mm-hm.

16:02.227 --> 16:05.393
And you're the one saying
I should leave at 2:30 in the morning.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.435
I don't always do this sort of thing,
you know?

16:11.518 --> 16:13.352
Hey, I'm not judging, I'm just...

16:13.435 --> 16:16.477
And if you knew I was married,
then you're as bad as me.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.602
Not really.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.685
I didn't tell your husband
I'd be faithful to him

16:19.768 --> 16:21.643
and stand by him in sickness and health,
blah, blah.

16:21.727 --> 16:23.607
- Again, not judging, just saying.
- Wait, wait.

16:23.643 --> 16:26.477
You don't know anything
about me or my husband.

16:26.935 --> 16:29.727
Only that you were just unfaithful to him,
and he doesn't know

16:29.810 --> 16:31.970
or you wouldn't be throwing me out
and being defensive.

16:32.018 --> 16:34.893
Okay, marriage doesn't always turn out
like you planned, okay?

16:34.977 --> 16:37.268
I mean, he hasn't exactly
fulfilled his promise.

16:37.352 --> 16:39.518
I thought he'd be something big
in entertainment by now

16:39.602 --> 16:41.810
and I'd be living in a mansion
in Beverly Hills.

16:42.477 --> 16:44.643
I'm pretty sure they drop that
from the vows now.

16:44.727 --> 16:46.018
As for throwing you out...

16:46.935 --> 16:50.352
I just suggested
that we exchange numbers, so...

16:50.435 --> 16:52.185
So we could do this again?

16:52.935 --> 16:55.768
I thought you didn't do
this sort of thing all the time.

16:55.852 --> 16:57.852
- Fuck off.
- Charming.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.643
Okay.

17:11.393 --> 17:13.102
Yep, thanks. Frank!

17:14.060 --> 17:17.685
Like ten percent bigger.
Better for my cheekbones, right?

17:17.768 --> 17:19.268
- Yeah.
- See that?

17:19.352 --> 17:22.435
Can I get a word? Now is good.

17:26.518 --> 17:27.518
Yep, have a seat.

17:28.852 --> 17:32.060
Something's cooking in Ecuador.
The intel's a little sketchy,

17:32.143 --> 17:35.227
but it looks like an uprising
could be underway.

17:35.310 --> 17:39.685
Rebel troops amassing, reports
of arms stockpiles, that kind of thing.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.518
They can't say exactly when
it's gonna blow, but it's gonna.

17:42.602 --> 17:44.560
- You interested?
- I'm gone.

17:44.643 --> 17:49.185
It's dangerous.
Drug gangs ruling the streets. With guns.

17:49.268 --> 17:52.477
Kidnapping tourists... journalists.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.227
Listen, if you're not feeling
as brave as you pretend...

17:58.060 --> 18:01.393
- ...tell me now.
- When do I go?

18:01.477 --> 18:03.143
This afternoon.

18:03.727 --> 18:06.352
- You wanna take Claire?
- No.

18:06.435 --> 18:09.268
Pointless having two journalists
on the spot.

18:09.352 --> 18:12.352
Remember last time I was in Pakistan,
I had transmission problems?

18:12.810 --> 18:14.935
- I should take a technician.
- All right.

18:15.810 --> 18:17.018
Let's see.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.643
- Finch is available.
- Fine.

18:20.727 --> 18:23.768
All right. Work it out with him. Let's go.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.477
Marie, I need two tickets to Quito.

18:31.727 --> 18:34.852
- You could stay here with us.
- That would be a pleasure.

18:34.935 --> 18:36.185
Thanks, guys.

18:37.352 --> 18:39.852
You're the closest thing to family
I've got, if I'm honest.

18:40.727 --> 18:42.560
I've always felt at home here.

18:43.185 --> 18:45.977
- Hoping it won't come to that.
- You're coming to Ecuador with me.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.977
Get your passport to admin.
They need details to clear entry papers.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.852
- What, now?
- Yeah, we're going this afternoon.

18:51.935 --> 18:56.185
- No. I'd love to, but it's impossible.
- Why? What's the problem?

18:56.852 --> 18:57.852
My wife's left me.

18:58.893 --> 19:00.852
After the stakeout with Claire last night.

19:01.602 --> 19:04.685
I came home this morning
and went to give her a hug

19:04.768 --> 19:06.685
and she just pushed...

19:07.810 --> 19:09.518
Said she needed some distance.

19:09.602 --> 19:13.143
Told me to leave her alone.
Can you believe that?

19:13.227 --> 19:15.102
Don't worry. It happens to all couples.

19:15.185 --> 19:17.935
A week in Ecuador with me,
it'll take your mind off things.

19:18.018 --> 19:23.018
Thanks for the offer, but I'm gonna
stay around and see if I can work it out.

19:23.102 --> 19:26.102
These things are a sign.
You need to move on, have an adventure.

19:26.185 --> 19:28.560
- I've written her a letter.
- You've written a novel.

19:28.643 --> 19:31.227
- I had a lot to say.
- And on radio station paper? Romantic.

19:32.018 --> 19:35.435
I put a few photos in, as well.
To remind her of the good times.

19:35.518 --> 19:37.198
That's quite a package
she's gonna receive.

19:37.268 --> 19:39.908
Actually, you're good with words.
Can you have a look at it for me?

19:41.810 --> 19:42.810
Yeah, sure.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.435
- That's not how you spell "suicide."
- Cheers.

19:50.518 --> 19:52.810
You know what?
A country going through a rebel coup

19:52.893 --> 19:55.268
is no place to be crying over a wife
who's left you.

19:55.352 --> 19:56.952
- You just need to move on.
- That's funny.

19:57.018 --> 19:59.018
I'm playing a video game
called <i>Rebel Coup</i>.

19:59.102 --> 20:02.560
Eleanor thinks it's childish,
a grown man playing games.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.893
I should've paid her more attention.

20:06.977 --> 20:10.810
But then, would I have achieved
such a high score? Who knows?

20:13.393 --> 20:16.727
You know what? Maybe I'll ask
someone else to come along.

20:17.393 --> 20:18.893
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

20:31.893 --> 20:33.852
- How long you away for?
- A week or two.

20:33.935 --> 20:36.893
- Can I get an SM58 and a MIDI MkII?
- Yeah.

20:38.393 --> 20:40.352
I've changed my mind. I'm coming.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.435
That way, my wife can stay
in that empty apartment, all alone,

20:44.518 --> 20:46.977
and think of me, maybe even miss me.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.685
- Great.
- Are they bulletproof vests?

20:50.768 --> 20:52.893
- Yeah, they are.
- What, for...?

20:53.977 --> 20:55.185
Why is the...?

20:55.268 --> 20:58.852
Why are they...? Why do they end...?
Have you got bulletproof pants?

20:58.935 --> 21:00.810
Otherwise, what's the... point?

21:02.727 --> 21:05.185
Passports, entry papers and tickets.

21:05.268 --> 21:07.727
You have a United flight to Quito
at 2 p.m. from Newark.

21:07.810 --> 21:09.268
- Cheers.
- Don't lose them.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.643
Why would I lose them?

21:11.352 --> 21:14.393
- I was just saying.
- What, like I lost my wife?

21:17.352 --> 21:19.435
- Do you have everything?
- I think so.

21:19.518 --> 21:21.893
I wish I had one of those
wheelie things now.

21:23.310 --> 21:24.810
- Listen to me.
- What?

21:24.893 --> 21:27.268
When we get there, they're at war.

21:27.352 --> 21:30.685
- I don't wanna be a babysitter, okay?
- I won't let you down.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.360
- What should I do with the letter?
- Forget it.

21:34.435 --> 21:36.795
- What do you mean?
- Who's the man in this relationship, hmm?

21:36.852 --> 21:39.310
- Don't be a pussy.
- Sexist.

21:39.393 --> 21:40.602
- What?
- Nothing.

21:40.685 --> 21:42.852
- Listen, you need to grow a pair.
- Of breasts?

21:42.935 --> 21:45.393
- Balls.
- Oh, sorry. It's because you said "pair."

21:45.477 --> 21:48.037
Because I say "pair of breasts,"
but I don't say "pair of balls."

21:48.102 --> 21:50.602
- I just say "balls."
- Throw the letter away.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.018
- Right.
- Let her wonder where you are.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.310
After a couple weeks,
you won't wanna know her anymore.

21:54.393 --> 21:56.060
Don't give me the
"there's plenty more fish in the sea."

21:56.143 --> 21:58.352
I was gonna say there's
plenty more women in the world.

21:58.435 --> 22:00.685
- You seen Ecuadorian girls?
- No. What are they like?

22:00.768 --> 22:04.102
They're like Spanish women,
but different. With ponchos. You'll see.

22:07.727 --> 22:12.268
Cheers. I'm sorry.
They keep coming off.

22:12.352 --> 22:15.018
My problem is I've got slopy shoulders,
so it's hard.

22:15.977 --> 22:17.102
That is a problem.

22:19.185 --> 22:21.393
- Can we stop off at mine on the way?
- What for?

22:21.477 --> 22:23.560
I've hardly got any clothes.
This is all equipment.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.310
Forget it, you can get some
when we get to Quito. Come on.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.852
Be careful. Both of you, obviously.

22:35.685 --> 22:38.477
- It'll be dangerous.
- Danger's my middle name.

22:41.852 --> 22:44.310
Mine's Dennis.

22:46.102 --> 22:47.643
- See you soon, then.
- Yeah.

22:47.727 --> 22:48.727
Cheers.

23:01.685 --> 23:03.560
<i>Hi, I'm not around. Leave a message.</i>

23:04.560 --> 23:05.602
Voicemail.

23:06.227 --> 23:08.685
She obviously sees my number
and she doesn't pick up

23:08.768 --> 23:10.352
because she doesn't wanna talk to me.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.227
Can I borrow your cell?
She won't recognize the number.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.030
- I thought you'd let her sweat.
- No, I know.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.560
But I was gonna let her know
that we're going to Ecuador,

23:17.643 --> 23:20.268
a war-torn country, sort of cool-like.

23:20.352 --> 23:22.310
Yeah, no, you do cool great.

23:22.393 --> 23:24.633
That's why I'm so confident
having you as my only support

23:24.685 --> 23:26.935
in a scary, dangerous, hostile place.

23:27.018 --> 23:29.018
It's like having my own John Wayne.

23:29.102 --> 23:31.352
Listen to me, you bumbling little fool,
we agreed,

23:31.435 --> 23:34.643
your problems,
they're your problems, not mine.

23:34.727 --> 23:37.602
- Okay?
- One, rude. Two...

23:37.685 --> 23:41.102
Okay, I'll just call her back on mine.
Not a problem. Thanks for your help.

23:43.185 --> 23:44.985
<i>Hi, I'm not around.
Leave a message.</i>

23:45.018 --> 23:47.060
Hi, it's me.

23:47.143 --> 23:53.018
Listen, I'm off to Ecuador
to cover a pretty dangerous war.

23:53.102 --> 23:57.060
Um, we'll talk about everything
when I get back. If I get back.

23:57.602 --> 24:01.393
It's cut out. Oh, it's the tunnel.
Sorry, can you avoid the tunnels?

24:20.685 --> 24:21.685
Tickets.

24:24.393 --> 24:26.310
That's not the tickets,
that's your letter.

24:26.393 --> 24:29.393
- I threw the letter away.
- No, you didn't. It's right there.

24:29.477 --> 24:30.768
What did I throw away, then?

24:31.518 --> 24:33.060
Don't tell me you threw away
the passports!

24:33.143 --> 24:37.060
You said to throw away the letter,
so I threw it in the truck.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.935
- Which truck?
- The garbage truck.

24:39.518 --> 24:43.227
Because I must've mixed up the...
Let's go back to the station,

24:43.310 --> 24:45.518
tell them we lost the tickets,
get new tickets.

24:45.602 --> 24:47.143
We'll come tomorrow. It's fine.

24:47.227 --> 24:49.768
You threw away the passports,
the tickets, and the cash?

24:49.852 --> 24:51.935
Where are we gonna get
new fucking passports from?

24:52.018 --> 24:54.643
- In one day! In one day!
- What else are we gonna do?

24:55.893 --> 24:58.143
- Unbelievable.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

24:59.227 --> 25:02.227
You're a stupid, worthless, idiotic,

25:02.310 --> 25:04.852
- incompetent piece of shit. You know that?
- Yeah.

25:05.893 --> 25:08.393
- What?
- Yes, I do know that.

25:11.393 --> 25:13.893
Fuck. Taxi!

25:22.518 --> 25:25.977
Yes, it's Finch and Frank!
Hi! How was Ecuador?

25:26.060 --> 25:28.140
Shh! What? Is anyone from
the radio station in there?

25:28.185 --> 25:31.352
- No. Why?
- I'll explain later. Get in. Get in.

25:31.435 --> 25:34.352
- Get in. Get in.
- Oh, God.

25:34.435 --> 25:38.102
- That's quite a story.
- It is.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.393
We need to work out
what we're gonna do.

25:41.477 --> 25:43.477
- We need to brainstorm.
- Brainstorm.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.560
Brainstorm.

25:46.143 --> 25:48.393
- What is a "brainstorm"?
- I love these two to bits

25:48.477 --> 25:50.237
but they're not
the sharpest tool in the box.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.810
Whereas you're a genius?

25:52.268 --> 25:55.185
Either of you ever thrown away your
passports on the way to the airport?

25:55.268 --> 25:57.477
- Yes.
- Okay.

25:58.435 --> 25:59.977
Brainstorm.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.268
Could two other people go
instead of you?

26:02.352 --> 26:06.018
- What? Of course not.
- Can you go somewhere else?

26:06.935 --> 26:10.310
- No. The story I'm covering is in Ecuador.
- Oh, okay.

26:10.393 --> 26:12.102
Can you cover a different story?

26:12.185 --> 26:15.935
No. It needs to be that story, it needs
to be Ecuador and it needs to be us.

26:16.727 --> 26:18.685
And we haven't got passports.

26:19.477 --> 26:20.768
- I got it.
- Go on.

26:20.852 --> 26:22.935
You can use someone else's passports.

26:23.018 --> 26:25.060
- Ours.
- Oh, we're screwed.

26:25.143 --> 26:27.727
- No, but she's... and we're...
- Okay, um...

26:27.810 --> 26:31.477
You can save up money for new tickets,
and by then, the passports will be here.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.060
And the war will be over.

26:33.143 --> 26:35.310
- That's good then.
- Not for us.

26:35.393 --> 26:37.518
No, but for the people. Less will die.

26:37.602 --> 26:39.893
- Less will die.
- They're thinking of the people.

26:39.977 --> 26:41.852
- Less will die.
- You'll die, though. I'll kill you.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.352
Look...

26:43.435 --> 26:45.893
Let's go over and explain.
Maybe Mallard won't fire us.

26:45.977 --> 26:47.977
He'll fire you when I tell him
how fuckin' useless you are.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.268
- Language.
- Oh, my God.

26:49.352 --> 26:52.393
He's gonna think that I chickened out,
that I didn't have the guts to go.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.393
That'll give him the perfect excuse
to fire me.

26:54.477 --> 26:56.268
I'm gonna have to kill him.
I'll go to jail.

26:56.352 --> 26:58.185
I'll get out of jail,
and then I'll kill you.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.518
So, let's not do that.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.060
- Think!
- Okay.

27:04.102 --> 27:06.727
They're expecting a report
from us at 10:00, from Ecuador,

27:06.810 --> 27:08.268
and there's no way we can get there.

27:14.727 --> 27:17.977
We don't need to get there.
They're expecting a report from Ecuador.

27:18.060 --> 27:20.393
Let's give them one on a cell phone.

27:20.477 --> 27:25.935
The same number would show whether
we were in London, New York or Quito.

27:26.018 --> 27:29.352
- I can create a soundscape. A war zone.
- It'll never work.

27:29.435 --> 27:32.227
It will work. It will work.
Can I use your spare room?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.060
- Brainstorm.
- Brainstorm.

27:35.143 --> 27:38.227
- Come in. Come in. Welcome.
- Right this way.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.518
Must be great,
living right above the restaurant.

27:40.602 --> 27:42.402
- Never late for work.
- Oh, we are.

27:42.435 --> 27:44.143
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.

27:44.227 --> 27:48.102
- Sure.
- Come in, up the stairs.

27:49.227 --> 27:50.518
More stairs.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.560
Excellent.

28:02.810 --> 28:03.977
Okay.

28:05.477 --> 28:06.685
Give me half an hour.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.185
Cheers, guys. All right.

28:20.810 --> 28:22.685
We meant to go to Ecuador.

28:22.768 --> 28:26.060
We got as far as an apartment
on top of a restaurant

28:26.143 --> 28:27.935
across the road from the radio station.

28:28.852 --> 28:31.352
- You don't like it?
- Oh, no, it's lovely.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.727
That's not what I meant. I...

28:36.685 --> 28:40.643
No, it's fine. It's just... you know.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.810
You know Kim and Kanye?

28:52.602 --> 28:54.727
No. No, I don't.

28:56.060 --> 29:00.143
Beyoncé? Jay Z? They are your friends?

29:01.018 --> 29:03.185
Friends? No. Not friends.

29:20.768 --> 29:25.185
- The Jonas Brothers?
- Jonas Brothers.

29:25.268 --> 29:26.852
I don't know the Jonas Brothers.

29:31.810 --> 29:34.227
You want to read about
Honey Boo Boo child?

29:41.477 --> 29:44.435
- I don't know what he wants.
- Okay, come on up, guys.

29:50.893 --> 29:54.518
Okay, close your eyes. Ready?

30:03.352 --> 30:04.977
Beautiful rain forest.

30:07.060 --> 30:08.352
Birds.

30:13.435 --> 30:16.810
There's monkeys. Parrots.

30:17.643 --> 30:20.060
Hold on. Here comes a tank.

30:20.143 --> 30:21.810
Oh. Machine-gun fire.

30:22.810 --> 30:23.810
Airplanes.

30:23.893 --> 30:27.185
A helicopter hovers overhead.
Oh. Explosions.

30:29.810 --> 30:30.893
Hand grenades.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.727
Welcome to Ecuador.

30:41.477 --> 30:44.227
The government's just closed the borders.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.852
The information just came from
the Secretary of State's office.

30:46.935 --> 30:49.435
There may have been
a sarin gas warning.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.198
Yeah, the dispatch just came in.

30:57.310 --> 30:59.727
Okay. I'm gonna call in,
if you're ready.

31:00.310 --> 31:03.393
So, guys, shout out some stuff
in the background, add to the atmosphere.

31:03.477 --> 31:06.685
- What should we say?
- Anything. Spanish.

31:09.518 --> 31:11.685
It's Frank.

31:14.602 --> 31:16.977
- Frank, where are you now?
- I'm in Quito.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.477
<i>- You managed to get through?</i>
- Yeah. Why?

31:20.560 --> 31:23.643
They've closed the borders.
There was a sarin gas warning.

31:24.185 --> 31:27.727
You know what? Stay on the line.
Let me put you through to the studio.

31:27.810 --> 31:31.268
I want you to sell Bonneville
as an exclusive. Hold on.

31:31.352 --> 31:34.185
<i>Q365.</i>

31:34.935 --> 31:38.227
Our reporter, Frank Bonneville,
who managed to get into Ecuador

31:38.310 --> 31:42.560
before the borders were closed,
has an exclusive for Q365 News.

31:42.643 --> 31:47.393
<i>Live from Ecuador, he will now give us the
first account of this latest development.</i>

31:47.477 --> 31:48.935
<i>- Frank.
- In Quito,</i>

31:49.018 --> 31:52.852
the man on the street doesn't know
that tomorrow, in addition to the gunfire

31:52.935 --> 31:55.060
and indiscriminate attacks...

31:55.143 --> 31:57.643
...the threat of chemical war
looms over the city.

31:58.352 --> 32:00.393
However,
the sudden closure of the border

32:00.477 --> 32:02.602
confirms the seriousness
of the situation.

32:02.685 --> 32:03.685
Real Madrid!

32:05.602 --> 32:09.227
And this is a new threat the government
could really have done without, Frank?

32:09.310 --> 32:11.390
<i>My thoughts exactly.
For the last three days,</i>

32:11.435 --> 32:15.518
they've been fighting an enemy
that no bomb can possibly destroy.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.935
- Sand.
- Julio Iglesias!

32:20.435 --> 32:23.143
Raised in squalls by the shrieking,
violent wind,

32:23.227 --> 32:25.893
the desert sand
has brought the city to a standstill.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.810
<i>The men and their targeting
instruments are blind.</i>

32:28.893 --> 32:30.768
<i>The air force is grounded.</i>

32:31.852 --> 32:35.393
<i>The sky has changed color.
The temperature has dropped.</i>

32:35.477 --> 32:38.310
The sun has all but disappeared,
leaving the locals,

32:38.393 --> 32:41.518
the innocent victims
in this bloody infighting, to wonder:

32:41.602 --> 32:43.935
what has happened
to the world they once knew?

32:44.602 --> 32:46.893
This is Frank Bonneville,
live from Quito.

32:48.018 --> 32:51.977
Okay, good.
But I think we need more information.

32:52.060 --> 32:56.143
Because I'm pretty sure sand
isn't a big problem in Ecuador.

32:56.227 --> 33:01.018
I think it's quite lush
and rain-foresty and...

33:01.102 --> 33:03.560
- banana plants and things.
- Okay.

33:03.643 --> 33:06.352
And also, guys,
imagine you're in your village.

33:06.435 --> 33:08.560
Aah! What might you shout?

33:11.810 --> 33:13.477
- What does that mean?
- Uncle Miguel!

33:13.560 --> 33:16.435
- Why would you shout "Uncle Miguel"?
- Because he's almost deaf.

33:17.810 --> 33:20.643
Be scared.
Shout something about your children.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.768
- What does that mean?
- My baby is getting fat!

33:26.852 --> 33:29.092
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Because you say:

33:29.143 --> 33:31.977
"Say something about children,"
and I love fat babies

33:32.060 --> 33:34.685
- because it means they're eating well.
- Yeah.

33:35.518 --> 33:38.102
- It's true.
- I know, I like fat babies.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.060
Mm.

33:58.768 --> 34:00.185
What happened to the TV?

34:05.060 --> 34:09.060
<i>The fact of the matter is that the face
of poverty, no matter where you are,</i>

34:09.143 --> 34:12.018
<i>- is always the same.</i>
- Look at this guy, Baker.

34:12.101 --> 34:14.862
There's a guy that can fake something.
He's got a bulletproof vest on,

34:14.935 --> 34:17.685
- he's 50 feet from the hotel.
- How do you know where he is?

34:17.768 --> 34:20.560
Because of that fountain. I saw it
from my room last time I was there.

34:20.643 --> 34:25.185
No one knows. I think we're so much better
off here... Thank you... than Ecuador.

34:25.268 --> 34:28.768
We've got wine, snacks.
We're not being shot at.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.310
You two make a good team.

34:31.393 --> 34:33.435
First time
we've worked together, officially.

34:33.518 --> 34:35.310
On something big, like this. Yeah.

34:35.393 --> 34:37.435
- His forte is sports.
- Yeah.

34:37.518 --> 34:39.851
- How many Tours de France have you done?
- Twenty-five.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.726
- In France?
- Nah, didn't go there.

34:43.810 --> 34:47.101
I sort of ran it from here,
to make sure it all went smoothly.

34:47.185 --> 34:49.768
And the Olympics?
You've done a few of those, too, right?

34:49.851 --> 34:53.226
Just four. But they are
only every four years, so, not bad.

34:53.310 --> 34:56.976
- Where did you go? Beijing?
- I didn't get to Beijing, no.

34:57.060 --> 35:00.227
- No, you did those from here, too, right?
- Yes. Yeah.

35:00.352 --> 35:04.477
- So, have you actually been anywhere?
- Yeah.

35:07.102 --> 35:09.643
- England.
- No, you're from England.

35:09.727 --> 35:11.643
- That doesn't count.
- Yeah. Okay.

35:11.727 --> 35:15.477
- Here, then.
- Anywhere other than here.

35:17.935 --> 35:19.435
- England.
- Wow.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.685
Yeah.

35:21.602 --> 35:25.602
Every two-bit hack in New York got into
Ecuador before they closed the border.

35:25.685 --> 35:28.018
- I need something special.
- We got some great stuff.

35:28.102 --> 35:30.143
- We got some exclusive stuff.
- You still in Quito?

35:30.227 --> 35:33.268
Are we still in Quito? No, we're in...

35:35.143 --> 35:38.727
We're in the south,
we're in a place called... Machala.

35:39.227 --> 35:41.307
We thought it'd be good to get in
amongst the people.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.977
Good. Yeah, yeah,
give them something personal.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.268
That always gets them.
All right, you're on in five.

35:47.102 --> 35:51.310
And now, we go live to our special
correspondent in Quito, Frank Bonneville.

35:51.393 --> 35:54.268
The villagers could've left
Sergeant Miguel to die.

35:54.810 --> 35:56.602
But they chose to save the man.

35:57.518 --> 36:00.310
A man, who, minutes earlier
with his fellow troops,

36:00.393 --> 36:03.102
had been showering the area
with fire and steel.

36:03.185 --> 36:07.393
This place might be a rebel stronghold,
but these are kind people.

36:08.143 --> 36:12.102
It's simply not in their nature
to let a man die on their land.

36:12.185 --> 36:16.268
- Whoever they are.
- Oh, shit! Ooh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:17.560 --> 36:21.102
Earlier today, I watched
as a woman from the village

36:21.185 --> 36:23.143
desperately tried to save her own child,

36:23.227 --> 36:26.143
feverishly wiping the blood
off the pavement

36:26.227 --> 36:29.143
<i>as if that would somehow bring him back.</i>

36:29.227 --> 36:33.560
A peasant, a fat, sweaty peasant,
looked on,

36:33.643 --> 36:39.518
useless, hopeless, worthless even,
knowing that nothing he ever did

36:39.602 --> 36:41.977
could possibly do any good.

36:42.060 --> 36:43.977
This is Frank Bonneville,
live from Machala.

36:46.435 --> 36:49.268
- Good work.
- You're on again at 7:00, call back.

36:50.852 --> 36:55.102
- That's why he's the best.
- I hope they're being careful.

36:59.143 --> 37:01.018
Well, we got away with it again.

37:10.518 --> 37:12.060
Looks like we made quite an impact.

37:23.727 --> 37:26.407
- I'm not sure about this.
- We can't stay in the apartment all day.

37:26.435 --> 37:28.268
We need some fresh air,
some exercise.

37:28.352 --> 37:31.310
I know, but what if we're spotted?
Game over, isn't it?

37:31.393 --> 37:33.560
Oh, wow. Look. Oh.

37:34.602 --> 37:36.268
<i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> 14.

37:37.185 --> 37:39.560
I collect comics,
so I know that's a good one.

37:39.643 --> 37:41.685
Yeah, we really should get back.
Come on.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.643
- It's Mallard.
- Shit. Don't answer it.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.810
I've gotta answer it. Hi.

37:53.560 --> 37:58.727
It's Finch. He's in the toilet. Yeah.

37:59.518 --> 38:03.935
I don't know where we are, exactly.
It's all written in Spanish, obviously.

38:04.018 --> 38:06.185
So... That's the subway.

38:07.268 --> 38:10.393
That's what we call the trucks
that drive the tanks.

38:10.477 --> 38:14.768
Yeah, because it sounds like the subway.
Okay, yeah, I'll let him know.

38:16.393 --> 38:18.977
- He wants you to do a report at 1:00.
- Shit.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.352
- He's onto us, man.
- He's...

38:22.560 --> 38:27.060
Hi. Yeah, he's out. Okay, hold on.

38:28.143 --> 38:30.518
- Hello?
- I just need a 60-second update, Frank,

38:30.602 --> 38:32.643
and then, uh,
we'll trail something bigger.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.435
- Here?
<i>- What do you mean, "Here"?</i>

38:34.518 --> 38:37.560
- I mean, now?
- Yes, yes. We're transferring you.

38:37.643 --> 38:40.393
Now we go live
to Frank Bonneville in Ecuador.

38:40.477 --> 38:43.518
A cloud of dust rises into the horizon.

38:44.602 --> 38:47.810
The silence is broken by the
caterpillar tracks of two rogue tanks...

38:49.143 --> 38:52.018
...whose tracks are biting
into the dust on the remote road.

38:52.102 --> 38:53.893
<i>A helicopter hovers overhead.</i>

38:57.143 --> 38:59.852
- Is this Dr. Schmalzstein's office?
- No. Shh.

39:00.393 --> 39:02.852
In the bombed-out remains
of what was once his home,

39:02.935 --> 39:04.175
a young boy watches television.

39:04.227 --> 39:07.060
Blow it out your ass!

39:07.227 --> 39:10.602
American television.
Shells are incoming.

39:12.393 --> 39:17.102
My technician is hit by shrapnel.
Oh, no, he's fine.

39:17.185 --> 39:19.102
But we gotta get out of here. Fast.

39:37.435 --> 39:40.685
It's quiet. Too quiet, if anything.

39:43.935 --> 39:49.518
In the sky, a combat helicopter stops.
An explosion rings out.

39:49.602 --> 39:51.977
My own technician
has another near miss.

39:52.435 --> 39:54.977
A bullet flies inches above his head.

39:55.893 --> 40:00.352
Luckily for him, he's so short,
or he'd most certainly be dead by now.

40:00.435 --> 40:03.227
This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.768
Coming up at 7:00,
we will have another exclusive

40:05.852 --> 40:07.352
from Frank Bonneville.

40:07.435 --> 40:10.518
That was too close for comfort.
We can't get caught out like this again.

40:10.602 --> 40:14.102
We've gotta plan this, be in control.
And we need something new.

40:14.185 --> 40:18.018
When Mallard first asked you to go
to Ecuador, what did he say, exactly?

40:18.102 --> 40:20.893
Just that the rebel forces
were amassing arms, weapons.

40:20.977 --> 40:23.185
- What else?
- Conjecture, rumors.

40:23.268 --> 40:26.477
That's enough for you, though,
isn't it? Anything that sells news.

40:26.560 --> 40:30.185
- Well, if people weren't so gullible...
- That's it.

40:30.268 --> 40:31.727
- What?
- We start a rumor.

40:31.852 --> 40:35.602
One that can't be proved wrong. We invent
someone, someone behind all this.

40:35.685 --> 40:38.977
And when people say,
"Oh, we can't find this guy, who is he?"

40:39.060 --> 40:42.477
"Well, no, of course you can't find him.
He's elusive. He's an evil genius.

40:42.560 --> 40:46.810
He's protected by a loyal army.
He can work for anyone.

40:46.935 --> 40:48.227
Be funded by anyone."

40:49.768 --> 40:51.408
They'll just deny it, though, won't they?

40:51.477 --> 40:55.143
So, the headline would read
"So-and-so denies funding terrorists."

40:55.268 --> 40:57.227
- Great.
- That's unethical, though.

40:57.352 --> 41:01.018
Yeah, but it's news.
What's a popular Spanish name?

41:02.060 --> 41:06.477
Alvarez. Santiago. Emilio.

41:07.060 --> 41:11.102
The man is Emilio Santiago Alvarez,

41:11.185 --> 41:14.893
the instigator of the attacks against
government forces in Ecuador.

41:16.102 --> 41:20.518
A small man, with no profile,
no international presence.

41:21.685 --> 41:25.852
But here, in the jungles and towns
of southern Ecuador,

41:25.935 --> 41:27.393
he's become a folk hero...

41:27.935 --> 41:30.810
a man unafraid to stand up
and be counted.

41:31.685 --> 41:36.018
<i>But on the street, rumors persist
that Alvarez may not be working alone.</i>

41:37.227 --> 41:41.893
His rebel forces are too well equipped,
too well trained, too well fed.

41:43.143 --> 41:47.602
It's said, and I must stress at this
point, these rumors are uncorroborated...

41:48.268 --> 41:51.935
that maybe Alvarez
has friends in high places.

41:52.018 --> 41:54.518
Perhaps a little too close to home.

41:54.643 --> 41:58.727
Jesus, is he saying that the rebel forces
are being funded by the U.S.?

41:58.810 --> 42:01.102
<i>This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News.</i>

42:01.185 --> 42:02.602
That's huge.

42:03.352 --> 42:05.518
Good one.
Couldn't have done better myself.

42:06.602 --> 42:10.018
- We can keep this going for ages.
- Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.

42:10.102 --> 42:12.227
They will.

42:13.018 --> 42:14.143
They will.

42:14.935 --> 42:17.435
Does Bonneville
realize the mess he's made

42:17.518 --> 42:21.143
by allowing speculation that this Alvarez
is working for the Americans?

42:21.268 --> 42:23.352
Most probably, Madam Secretary.

42:24.602 --> 42:28.852
Goddamn it. Why have we not heard of this
man before? Where's your intelligence?

42:28.977 --> 42:32.143
Our agents in Ecuador are tracing him now.

42:32.685 --> 42:36.060
It's a good chance they know him
by another name. A nickname.

42:36.643 --> 42:39.477
And if they don't find him,
government forces will.

42:39.560 --> 42:43.102
They're now looking for Bonneville
to make him confess his sources.

42:43.227 --> 42:47.435
And Alvarez's men are after him
because he revealed too much.

42:47.518 --> 42:50.268
He and his technician
are in serious danger.

42:50.352 --> 42:54.393
I do not wanna end up with two dead
citizens nor the wrath of their families.

42:55.602 --> 42:59.352
You are going to tell Finch and Bonneville
to get to the American embassy in Quito

42:59.435 --> 43:02.643
as soon as possible.
We need to know they're safe.

43:02.727 --> 43:05.018
Once they're safe, we will extract them.

43:05.518 --> 43:07.352
That is something we know how to do.

43:07.435 --> 43:10.227
<i>Little is known about the mastermind
behind the uprising,</i>

43:10.310 --> 43:12.727
<i>rebel fighter Emilio Alvarez.</i>

43:12.810 --> 43:15.518
<i>The charismatic leader
of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front</i>

43:15.602 --> 43:17.643
<i>is believed to come
from humble beginnings.</i>

43:17.727 --> 43:18.893
<i>The son of an unemployed,</i>

43:18.977 --> 43:23.602
<i>left-wing atheist father and an unmarried
mother with Communist sympathies.</i>

43:23.685 --> 43:27.977
<i>So, in your view, Alvarez has been quietly
amassing a force for some time now.</i>

43:28.060 --> 43:30.810
<i>What I'm hearing from my sources
is that Alvarez has risen</i>

43:30.893 --> 43:34.310
<i>to a position of power in the Ecuadorian
Liberation Front for some years.</i>

43:34.435 --> 43:36.560
I always knew he made up
most of the shit he reported.

43:36.643 --> 43:38.227
<i>So, why haven't we heard of him before?</i>

43:38.810 --> 43:42.310
<i>- Well, it makes perfect sense.</i>
- How is he keeping a straight face?

43:42.435 --> 43:44.435
<i>...less chance for the opposition
of targeting you.</i>

43:45.060 --> 43:48.018
<i>Successful revolution is all about
protecting your leaders.</i>

43:48.102 --> 43:51.310
<i>So, Frank Bonneville has gone where
no other news reporter has gone before</i>

43:51.393 --> 43:53.233
<i>in bringing this man
to the public's attention.</i>

43:53.310 --> 43:55.143
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

43:55.227 --> 43:57.393
<i>I've known about Alvarez myself
for a while now.</i>

43:57.477 --> 43:59.727
<i>I just didn't think it was appropriate
to unmask him yet.</i>

43:59.852 --> 44:01.810
Oh, come on.

44:01.893 --> 44:03.935
Oh.

44:14.685 --> 44:17.727
Hello? Yeah.

44:20.310 --> 44:21.310
Right.

44:24.143 --> 44:25.518
Uh-huh.

44:27.393 --> 44:28.518
What?

44:29.852 --> 44:32.018
Okay. Yeah, sure.

44:32.602 --> 44:34.643
Yeah, I'll call you
as soon as we get to Quito.

44:36.102 --> 44:37.102
Okay, thanks.

44:38.310 --> 44:39.352
- We're screwed.
- Why?

44:39.435 --> 44:42.018
- Everyone's looking for us, apparently.
- They won't find us.

44:42.143 --> 44:43.823
Of course they won't,
that's not the point.

44:43.852 --> 44:45.685
- What is?
- Mallard wants us to get to

44:45.768 --> 44:48.060
the U.S. embassy in Quito immediately.

44:48.143 --> 44:51.185
For our own safety.
The ambassador's waiting for us, okay?

44:51.268 --> 44:54.352
It's probably a few hours' drive
from Machala to Quito.

44:54.435 --> 44:56.435
I promised I'd call him
as soon as we got there.

44:56.518 --> 44:58.643
- As in, a few hours from now.
- Right.

45:00.143 --> 45:01.935
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

45:02.935 --> 45:04.575
- Because I'm not gonna call him.
- Why not?

45:04.643 --> 45:08.935
Because if I call him, he'll call the
embassy to arrange us to be flown home,

45:09.060 --> 45:12.602
- and they'll say we're not there. Right?
- Right. Yeah.

45:12.727 --> 45:14.727
What will he think
if you don't call him at all?

45:15.310 --> 45:17.560
- That something's happened to us.
- We're just missing?

45:17.685 --> 45:20.143
Yeah, that we're missing.
They can trace us, though.

45:20.227 --> 45:22.393
That's what they'd do
if they thought we were missing.

45:23.393 --> 45:27.310
- So, we'd have to destroy our phones.
- We only have to destroy the SIM card.

45:27.393 --> 45:29.310
- Right.
- Oh, God.

45:31.977 --> 45:33.977
How can you destroy it? It doesn't...

45:34.060 --> 45:36.268
You can't even...
Shall I just swallow it?

45:36.352 --> 45:38.935
Yeah, swallow it so they can trace it
straight to your ass!

45:39.018 --> 45:41.338
Why didn't we just go back
in the first place and just say:

45:41.393 --> 45:43.018
"Sorry, we threw away the tickets
and passports"?

45:43.143 --> 45:46.310
Why did you throw the fucking ticket
and the passport away in the first place?

45:46.393 --> 45:48.560
- That's the fucking question!
- Shut up!

45:48.643 --> 45:50.683
What will they think
we're arguing about downstairs?

45:50.768 --> 45:52.602
- I don't care!
- Are you mental?

45:53.435 --> 45:57.143
Fucking hell.
There. It's destroyed, okay?

45:58.643 --> 46:01.243
What are they gonna say,
"What were you arguing about last night?"

46:01.310 --> 46:03.102
In their house.

46:04.685 --> 46:06.602
You're such a pig.

46:06.685 --> 46:09.310
We haven't heard from them
since 10:00 last night.

46:09.393 --> 46:11.893
Maybe they lost communication,
maybe they've been arrested.

46:11.977 --> 46:15.977
Whatever the case, we need to
be very quiet about this for now.

46:16.060 --> 46:18.643
All right, drop everything,
check the hotels, hospitals,

46:18.727 --> 46:21.060
anybody we might know in the area
who might have seen them.

46:21.143 --> 46:23.103
And at some point,
we have to let Ian's wife know.

46:23.477 --> 46:25.060
- Leave it with me.
- Okay.

46:25.143 --> 46:27.310
I need a map of Ecuador, ASAP.

46:27.393 --> 46:30.518
- Got it.
- Q365 News. Hold on.

46:30.602 --> 46:32.310
It's Barrymore at the <i>New York Post.</i>

46:32.393 --> 46:33.852
<i>There's that little guy.</i>

46:33.935 --> 46:36.560
Okay, Barrymore, I gotta tell you,
I don't have time. What?

46:36.643 --> 46:40.393
I know you've got a big problem.
I just spoke to my correspondent in Quito.

46:40.518 --> 46:42.238
I don't know anything.
I can't say anything.

46:42.268 --> 46:45.227
I need photos for a profile piece.
Should I send a courier?

46:45.810 --> 46:48.560
- Being a bit hasty, aren't you?
- <i>If I know about it</i>

46:48.643 --> 46:50.602
then other people do, too,
and it'll get out.

46:50.685 --> 46:51.935
Send your courier.

46:52.477 --> 46:56.477
Okay, story's out. Change of plans.
You're going on at 7:00.

46:56.602 --> 47:00.435
Just say we've lost contact
with our special correspondents in Ecuador

47:00.518 --> 47:02.977
- but let's not panic everyone.
- Right.

47:03.060 --> 47:04.768
- You got this.
- Yeah.

47:04.852 --> 47:05.852
Okay.

47:08.602 --> 47:09.643
Oh, hold on.

47:11.268 --> 47:12.935
Excuse me, have you got <i>PC Gamer?</i>

47:13.810 --> 47:15.102
Look. Look.

47:16.602 --> 47:19.060
And uh, and the <i>New York Post.</i>

47:20.393 --> 47:22.393
Thanks. Cheers.

47:30.352 --> 47:34.143
- Do you want a drink?
- Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

47:39.060 --> 47:42.810
You know,
when you're in broadcasting...

47:44.018 --> 47:48.060
any number of things can happen,
but they aren't necessarily serious.

47:48.893 --> 47:53.018
If that's the case,
then they're gonna call any minute now.

48:00.477 --> 48:01.685
Do you know Frank well?

48:03.852 --> 48:05.477
Uh, Frank?

48:07.185 --> 48:10.518
We've been working together
for about five years.

48:11.310 --> 48:13.977
He's a great journalist.

48:14.685 --> 48:18.518
Bit of a loner. But I've been
working with Ian even longer.

48:20.352 --> 48:22.393
He's such a kind soul.

48:23.393 --> 48:25.935
- You must be worried sick.
- Yeah.

48:31.143 --> 48:32.227
What do you mean, "loner"?

48:34.810 --> 48:36.060
Uh...

48:37.685 --> 48:43.352
Well... you know what?
Actually, I could do with a drink.

48:50.018 --> 48:51.852
Aren't you gonna record
our conversation?

48:51.935 --> 48:55.060
Oh, no. This is strictly off the record.

48:55.143 --> 48:58.810
Because I tell you,
it is a very interesting story.

48:59.393 --> 49:01.768
My life, before I met Ian.

49:04.727 --> 49:07.560
- Before? Yeah.
- Yeah, you know, special interest.

49:07.643 --> 49:10.602
Because it might make people
engage with their plight even more.

49:10.685 --> 49:13.810
Well, maybe next time.

49:13.893 --> 49:17.102
I don't wanna add to your... stress.

49:18.268 --> 49:21.727
I mean, sometimes I think
that my life has been too dramatic.

49:22.477 --> 49:28.268
And I almost wish it was more, like, uh...
plain and boring.

49:28.352 --> 49:30.060
Well...

49:30.143 --> 49:33.935
- I should go. Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Clumsy.

49:41.477 --> 49:44.935
<i>Nothing yet leads us
to give in to anxiety,</i>

49:45.018 --> 49:49.518
<i>even if foreign journalists today
incur increasingly real risks.</i>

49:49.602 --> 49:53.018
<i>Thank you, Claire Maddox.
And coming up next, baseball.</i>

49:53.977 --> 49:57.560
If you don't get in touch at all,
they're going to think you're dead.

49:59.518 --> 50:03.143
- Or taken hostage, or, yeah.
- Taken hostage?

50:04.393 --> 50:07.935
- Yeah.
- We're taken hostage.

50:10.268 --> 50:13.102
- What do you mean?
- If we can fake being in Ecuador,

50:13.185 --> 50:15.435
- we can fake being taken hostage.
- That's bad.

50:15.518 --> 50:18.268
- That's not a good idea.
- It's not bad, it's genius.

50:18.352 --> 50:19.393
You're a genius.

50:19.477 --> 50:21.102
- Am I?
- Yeah.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.393
- He's a genius.
- He is a smart man.

50:23.477 --> 50:24.477
Nah.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.102
- It's a very good idea.
- Is it?

50:27.727 --> 50:28.893
I don't know.

50:31.018 --> 50:33.418
- Baby, you're blocking Ian.
- Oh, sorry.

50:33.477 --> 50:35.893
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

50:35.977 --> 50:37.060
It's recording.

50:38.643 --> 50:40.727
- And...
- Wait, wait, wait!

50:41.352 --> 50:42.352
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:42.393 --> 50:43.393
Ready?

50:43.810 --> 50:44.852
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.602
Hello.

50:48.685 --> 50:51.518
Don't smile and say "hello."
For God's sake.

50:51.602 --> 50:53.402
- What do you mean?
- You're in mortal danger.

50:53.477 --> 50:55.977
You got two guys that wanna kill you.
Are they high heels?

50:56.060 --> 50:59.268
- What rebel soldier wears high heels?
- They make my legs look longer.

50:59.352 --> 51:02.102
- It looks good, baby.
- Thank you, baby.

51:02.185 --> 51:05.102
Okay, no smiling. No hello.
Just straight to it.

51:08.143 --> 51:11.935
We are hostages
of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front.

51:12.018 --> 51:16.143
Um, and I am talking to the
president of the United States here

51:16.227 --> 51:18.477
when I say the situation is simple.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.643
If you do not pay the ransom,
we will be executed.

51:20.727 --> 51:21.727
- Stop. Okay.
- What?

51:21.768 --> 51:24.060
Why are you talking so casually,
so nonchalant?

51:24.143 --> 51:26.477
You gotta be begging.
Begging for your life.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.935
This guy, he wants to kill you.

51:28.018 --> 51:30.143
He wants to stick you like a pig,
so you need to beg.

51:30.227 --> 51:32.852
- A nice word to your family, to your wife.
- Yeah.

51:32.935 --> 51:35.102
The lens?
That's the whole world, right there.

51:35.185 --> 51:36.393
- You gotta connect.
- Yeah.

51:36.477 --> 51:38.393
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

51:39.018 --> 51:40.102
President.

51:40.185 --> 51:43.727
Beg the president, mention the family,
yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.060
No smiling.

51:51.727 --> 51:55.268
We are hostages of
the Ecuadorian Liberation Front,

51:55.352 --> 51:58.810
and I beg you, Mr. President,
please help us.

51:59.477 --> 52:03.352
Also, uh, tell my family I love them,
tell my wife...

52:03.435 --> 52:06.227
Why are you asking the president
to run errands for you?

52:06.310 --> 52:10.477
- Ugh. I don't know, I just... You said...
- Talk to them directly, to the lens.

52:11.560 --> 52:14.768
- Dear Mr. President, wife, family...
- Stop.

52:14.852 --> 52:16.393
- Get up.
- What?

52:19.310 --> 52:21.810
- Okay. Shake it out.
- Oh!

52:21.893 --> 52:24.810
- Take that, American pig!
- That wasn't part of the video.

52:24.893 --> 52:26.933
- What was that for?
- To help you get into your role.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.810
Who am I? Daniel Day-Fucking-Lewis?
Why am I doing this

52:29.893 --> 52:32.893
- if you're the charismatic broadcaster?
- Exactly. I can't do it.

52:32.977 --> 52:34.435
No one's gonna feel sorry for me.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.518
I got the looks, I got the charm,
I got the body. No sympathy.

52:37.602 --> 52:41.477
You, on the other hand,
you begging for your life? It's pathetic.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.518
It's like an ugly runt, mongrel dog
that no one wants,

52:44.602 --> 52:46.602
- that has to be put down.
- Yeah, I get the point.

52:48.852 --> 52:50.477
Didn't have to hit me.

52:52.518 --> 52:54.185
You've got this, Finch.

52:56.060 --> 52:59.268
My name is Ian Finch.
This is Frank Bonneville.

53:00.060 --> 53:03.227
<i>We work for the New York radio station
Q365 News.</i>

53:03.310 --> 53:04.643
You wanna see these?

53:04.727 --> 53:07.310
No, I don't wanna see anything.
And I'm not talking to you.

53:07.810 --> 53:08.810
As you wish.

53:09.643 --> 53:10.810
In the end, you were great, though.

53:10.893 --> 53:13.602
I'm sorry for what I did,
but it was for authenticity,

53:13.685 --> 53:16.185
- for the good of the cause.
- Didn't have to hit me that hard.

53:16.268 --> 53:18.060
So, can I hit you now?

53:18.143 --> 53:21.310
- You can try.
- No, I should just be allowed to hit you.

53:21.393 --> 53:22.673
- Why?
- For the good of the cause.

53:22.727 --> 53:25.268
But it wouldn't be,
that would just be you getting revenge.

53:25.352 --> 53:26.602
Not fair.

53:27.477 --> 53:29.310
Here you go. There it is.

53:30.393 --> 53:33.268
Take it over to the radio station,
make sure no one sees you.

53:56.102 --> 53:59.435
<i>My name is Ian Finch.
This is Frank Bonneville.</i>

54:00.102 --> 54:03.852
<i>We work for the New York radio station
Q365 News.</i>

54:03.935 --> 54:07.143
<i>We were reporting here
on the unrest in Ecuador</i>

54:07.227 --> 54:10.268
<i>when we were taken hostage
by the Ecuadorian Liberation Front.</i>

54:10.810 --> 54:13.602
<i>We have not been harmed.
If America submits to their demands,</i>

54:13.685 --> 54:15.852
<i>we will be set free
to return to the United States.</i>

54:15.935 --> 54:18.977
- Well, they're still alive.
<i>- If their demands are not met, however,</i>

54:19.060 --> 54:21.268
<i>we will be executed,
never to see our families again.</i>

54:21.352 --> 54:25.227
<i>Please take these people seriously.
They want money to fund their cause.</i>

54:25.310 --> 54:28.390
<i>They will contact you in the future.
Until then, you won't hear from us again.</i>

54:29.977 --> 54:32.602
Good evening,
and welcome to this special broadcast

54:32.685 --> 54:35.977
dedicated to Frank Bonneville
and Ian Finch.

54:36.060 --> 54:41.852
I'm joined by their colleague,
Claire Maddox, from Q365 News.

54:41.935 --> 54:44.893
<i>Uh, it's a very worrying time
for the press.</i>

54:44.977 --> 54:47.935
<i>Nothing can justify
taking journalists hostage.</i>

54:48.018 --> 54:50.602
<i>The only thing they're guilty of
is doing their job.</i>

54:50.685 --> 54:53.810
- You know she has a thing for you, right?
- Ridiculous.

54:56.393 --> 54:59.852
You never noticed? All those times
she brought you a cup of coffee?

55:01.518 --> 55:03.268
She brought everyone a cup of coffee.

55:04.477 --> 55:05.893
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:05.977 --> 55:08.643
- Didn't she?
- No. Just you.

55:09.602 --> 55:11.893
And you never once
bought her a cup in return.

55:11.977 --> 55:14.268
Hello. I have a wife.

55:14.352 --> 55:16.935
- Not anymore you don't.
- All right.

55:17.018 --> 55:19.227
You need to get over her. Move on.

55:19.310 --> 55:22.602
<i>...danger they face is indifference
and being forgotten.</i>

55:23.227 --> 55:25.852
<i>- And we shall not forget them.
- Well, you make a good point.</i>

55:26.685 --> 55:29.685
<i>Claire is not the only guest
we have tonight.</i>

55:29.768 --> 55:35.185
<i>We also have the wife of Ian Finch.
Please welcome Eleanor Finch.</i>

55:36.935 --> 55:39.268
- Welcome, it's so good to have you.
- Thank you.

55:39.352 --> 55:43.185
<i>Please, have a seat. Thanks so much
for coming on for the show today.</i>

55:43.268 --> 55:45.893
<i>- It must be very trying right now.
- Yeah. It is.</i>

55:45.977 --> 55:48.018
- That's your wife?
- I know.

55:48.102 --> 55:51.268
- Punching above my weight.
<i>- I decided to come on your show</i>

55:51.352 --> 55:53.893
<i>in the hope that this'll
be broadcast in Ecuador</i>

55:53.977 --> 55:56.018
and maybe my husband will see it.

55:56.102 --> 55:59.560
I've kept silent in the hope that
any negotiations would be successful,

55:59.643 --> 56:02.477
but the wait is unbearable.

56:02.560 --> 56:06.060
<i>I understand, and the whole
country is feeling for you right now.</i>

56:06.143 --> 56:09.852
<i>I know. The letters of support,
the portraits hanging in all the cities</i>

56:09.935 --> 56:13.102
<i>tell me the compassion that the American
people have for the hostages,</i>

56:13.185 --> 56:15.560
<i>- for my husband. Thank you.
- You're so right.</i>

56:15.643 --> 56:20.685
<i>And, together, we stand firm for Ian
and Frank to return amongst us.</i>

56:20.768 --> 56:22.727
- She loves me.
- Of course she does.

56:22.810 --> 56:27.185
- I have no right to do this to her.
<i>- I hope you don't mind, uh,</i>

56:27.268 --> 56:29.102
I've written a song for the hostages.

56:29.185 --> 56:30.905
Something to make sure
we don't forget them.

56:30.977 --> 56:32.977
- Yeah.
- I thought I might sing it.

56:33.060 --> 56:35.143
- I have a backing track.
- Oh. Uh, okay. Um...

56:35.227 --> 56:37.185
- Okay?
- All right. Uh...

56:37.268 --> 56:38.810
Thank you.

56:38.893 --> 56:41.852
- Okay, so it's, uh...
- It's called "A Dollar For A Hero."

56:41.935 --> 56:45.435
- Let's hear it now, a world exclusive.
- Can I stand?

56:45.518 --> 56:46.768
Yes, please do.

56:47.893 --> 56:50.018

Thank you, and I'd also like to appeal
to the generosity of the American public.

58:33.268 --> 58:34.352
Okay, please do.

58:34.435 --> 58:39.268
Um, if each of you just give a dollar

58:39.352 --> 58:42.227
for our heroes, our hostages.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.018
<i>I'm launching a campaign
to raise money...</i>

58:44.102 --> 58:45.227
What are you doing?

58:45.768 --> 58:47.935
- I'm sending her a dollar.
- What for?

58:48.018 --> 58:50.893
- For the heroes.
- Great idea.

58:52.727 --> 58:57.352
<i>So, you can donate on my website,
and that is www.eleanorfinch.com.</i>

58:58.352 --> 59:02.018
<i>Eleanor needs your help.
Thank you. That was great.</i>

59:10.435 --> 59:13.185
<i>Today is the eighth day
that Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch</i>

59:13.268 --> 59:16.685
have been held hostage in Ecuador.
We shall not forget them.

59:17.560 --> 59:21.143
You can still make your donations
to A Dollar For Our Heroes.

59:21.810 --> 59:22.727
Just to remind you,

59:22.810 --> 59:25.935
<i>you can still make your donations
to A Dollar For Our Heroes.</i>

59:26.018 --> 59:31.852
And we at Q365 News want to
thank you all for your emails of concern.

59:31.935 --> 59:34.852
We share your thoughts. We hope
that Ian and Frank will be home soon.

59:34.935 --> 59:37.295
- You wanted to see me?
- Listeners can't get enough.

59:37.352 --> 59:40.352
The ratings are officially insane.
We're the number one

59:40.435 --> 59:43.768
radio station in New York.
I never thought I'd be able to say that.

59:43.852 --> 59:45.977
Two of our friends
are being held hostage.

59:46.060 --> 59:47.227
Uh-huh.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.227
You're a good boss,
but you're a shitty person sometimes.

59:51.310 --> 59:53.852
- I'm sorry?
- You're excited that there's a news buzz

59:53.935 --> 59:57.685
- around two human beings in danger.
- Not just them. Eleanor Finch.

59:58.185 --> 01:00:00.977
The country has adopted her,
they can't get enough, they love her.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.185
They want more.

01:00:02.643 --> 01:00:06.310
I want you to keep an eye on her.
Hang out. Maybe become friends.

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:10.435
I don't know. There's more to her story
here, so get it and bring me.

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.893
You want to know
if she's lost her appetite,

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:18.060
if she takes sleeping pills before bed,
if she has a lover?

01:00:18.685 --> 01:00:19.977
You want me to be a spy?

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.018
Well, I'd like you to be a journalist!

01:00:35.227 --> 01:00:38.602
Are you guys hogging
the rubber bands? Yes, you are.

01:00:44.018 --> 01:00:45.060
Hey.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.935
There's a dollar in the hundies,
come on.

01:00:49.018 --> 01:00:50.727
You gotta be careful. Recount it.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:55.310
"A Dollar For Our Heroes."
That is a great idea. It's catchy.

01:00:55.393 --> 01:00:58.143
- You've been busy.
- Yeah. One of my skills.

01:00:58.227 --> 01:01:00.643
Organization, fund-raising.
I have a high likability factor,

01:01:00.727 --> 01:01:03.310
so, it's easy to get people to donate.
Want a T-shirt?

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:06.143
- Sure.
- I don't know, can you wear orange?

01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:07.602
Ew. No.

01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:12.643
We need to do something about
all this cash. There's $124,000 of it.

01:01:12.727 --> 01:01:17.018
Ooh. Yeah, we have a safe. Ian keeps
all his prized possessions in it. Comics.

01:01:17.102 --> 01:01:18.435
We need to be super vigilant.

01:01:18.518 --> 01:01:20.158
- We need to account for every cent.
- Sure.

01:01:20.227 --> 01:01:22.602
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.352
- Chris Denby.
- Ah.

01:01:24.435 --> 01:01:26.477
<i>- New York Post.</i>
- Yes, of course.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.893
I gotta go be in makeup
from morning to evening. I hate it.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:33.268
- Oh. You're doing it for Ian, so...
- Yeah. I am.

01:01:34.227 --> 01:01:36.935
Mrs. Finch, please, if we could, um...

01:01:37.018 --> 01:01:39.977
- You know, against those things, there.
- Mm-hm. Hm.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.435
These are his Disney characters.
Superman and stuff.

01:01:43.518 --> 01:01:47.685
Marvel. And it's Captain America.

01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:49.143
They're really great.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:54.685
Oh. You must really hate doing
these interviews and things,

01:01:54.768 --> 01:01:56.602
when you're so worried.

01:01:56.685 --> 01:01:58.477
- Yeah, but somebody's gotta do it.
- Nice.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.560
Hold on.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.727
- You should interview me.
- For what?

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:06.227
For anything you want.

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:09.518
Anyone'll run an interview on me.
You should do it. You know me.

01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:11.842
You know the boys.
You know the names of the little toys.

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:15.102
Could be a big opportunity for you.
From radio to TV?

01:02:15.185 --> 01:02:16.477
Could be your big break.

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.227
<i>- That's your house.
- Yeah.</i>

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.727
- Claire.
- That's Claire.

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:27.477
<i>Eleanor, you put Ian's Marvel collection
up for public auction.</i>

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.018
- What?
<i>- You must be thrilled by the results.</i>

01:02:30.102 --> 01:02:33.477
<i>- I am over the moon. I am so blown away.</i>
- She sold my Marvel collectibles.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.200
- They're just models.
- They're not models.

01:02:35.268 --> 01:02:37.768
They're perfect original figurines.

01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:40.852
<i>And the sum will be added to
the donations of the American people.</i>

01:02:40.935 --> 01:02:44.685
<i>I thank them from the bottom of my heart
in the name of my husband, Ian Finch.</i>

01:02:44.768 --> 01:02:47.518
<i>Why did you choose to sell
this particular collection?</i>

01:02:47.602 --> 01:02:50.852
<i>Well, first of all,
all the characters are extremely popular</i>

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:53.727
<i>and the most rare originals around,
and I just thought they would</i>

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.018
<i>raise the highest amount.</i>

01:02:55.102 --> 01:02:59.560
<i>What good are plastic superheroes,
when my husband, a real hero,</i>

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:03.352
<i>is off languishing in God knows where?</i>

01:03:03.935 --> 01:03:05.560
<i>- Ecuador.
- Ecuador.</i>

01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:09.102
We haven't even asked for a ransom
and she's already sold my collection.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.560
She wants to be ready
for when they make demands.

01:03:11.643 --> 01:03:13.602
- She already has the cash.
- Who's "they"?

01:03:14.352 --> 01:03:17.185
- The kidnappers.
- There are no... We're the kidnappers.

01:03:17.268 --> 01:03:20.018
And I'm not about to ask my wife
for so much money

01:03:20.102 --> 01:03:22.143
that she has to sell
my prized possessions.

01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:24.435
We're not gonna ask for money.
That's not the point.

01:03:24.518 --> 01:03:26.060
- So why she sell your dollies?
- Oh, for...

01:03:26.143 --> 01:03:32.310
They're not dollies. Listen, please.
Keep up. They're collectibles.

01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:33.727
They look like dollies.

01:04:29.852 --> 01:04:32.977
<i>Yeah, you know, I am anguished.</i>

01:04:33.602 --> 01:04:37.102
<i>There's a lot of sorrow.
There's, um, a lot of grief.</i>

01:04:37.185 --> 01:04:39.310
<i>I never got a chance to say, "I love you."</i>

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:41.352
<i>I didn't get that chance.</i>

01:04:41.435 --> 01:04:44.143
<i>At the same time, there's so many
blessings that are coming my way.</i>

01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:46.935
<i>- Right. Okay.
- I mean, the fact that the song is</i>

01:04:47.018 --> 01:04:50.935
<i>number one on iTunes
for two weeks running, right?</i>

01:04:51.018 --> 01:04:53.310
<i>- Two weeks. Right.
- I mean, that's a dream come true.</i>

01:04:53.393 --> 01:04:56.477
<i>I know you do want to reach out
to the kidnappers</i>

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.352
<i>and let them know that you're willing
to pay for their release.</i>

01:04:59.435 --> 01:05:03.060
<i>Of course. And I also wanna
let my fans know that,</i>

01:05:03.143 --> 01:05:05.477
<i>um, I'm working on another album.</i>

01:05:06.935 --> 01:05:10.060
<i>- On a bona fide album.</i>
- I've got a shitty wife.

01:05:12.352 --> 01:05:15.268
- What do you mean, exactly?
- She doesn't care about us. About me.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.310
This is just promoting herself.

01:05:18.393 --> 01:05:21.227
<i>...move away from that, you know?
Um...</i>

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.643
She does seem
a little happy about things.

01:05:23.727 --> 01:05:26.227
- Just a bit. Loving it. Although...
- Yeah.

01:05:27.518 --> 01:05:29.685
...I don't really care
that she's left me anymore.

01:05:30.352 --> 01:05:32.102
See? I knew you'd get over her.

01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:35.060
Well, I can see her for
what she really is now. And it's...

01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:36.602
Nah.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.185
- I can see her side a little bit, too.
- What do you mean?

01:05:42.268 --> 01:05:46.185
Well, she did leave her family and friends
behind to follow you to New York.

01:05:46.268 --> 01:05:48.227
Probably pictured both of you
making it big

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.893
and suddenly she finds herself
in a one-bedroom apartment

01:05:51.977 --> 01:05:54.393
with a guy who likes to spend
his spare time with comic books

01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:58.518
- and playing video games.
- I thought she was happy. Sorry.

01:05:58.602 --> 01:06:00.768
I'm glad you're over her.
You can move on with your life.

01:06:00.852 --> 01:06:05.310
<i>You've got a big fan out there. So, who
are some of your musical influences?</i>

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:07.393
How do you know I live
in a one-bedroom apartment?

01:06:07.477 --> 01:06:08.518
Hmm?

01:06:08.602 --> 01:06:10.727
"She finds herself
in a one-bedroom apartment."

01:06:14.393 --> 01:06:17.727
I don't know that it's a one-bedroom
apartment. It's a figure of speech.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.102
"One-bedroom apartment"
is a figure of speech?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:23.185
It's like, "Oh, I don't live in the
mansion I thought I was gonna live in."

01:06:23.268 --> 01:06:25.108
I don't literally mean
a one-bedroom apartment.

01:06:25.185 --> 01:06:27.393
I literally live
in a one-bedroom apartment.

01:06:27.477 --> 01:06:31.977
- So, it sounds like a diss.
- Oh, no, no. I didn't mean it like that.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.810
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
So, it's not a bad thing.

01:06:34.893 --> 01:06:36.602
- You made it sound bad.
- No.

01:06:36.685 --> 01:06:40.518
And you made the playing video games,
reading comics a bad thing, as well.

01:06:40.602 --> 01:06:44.435
- It's not what every woman likes in a man.
- Good. Because I don't want...

01:06:44.518 --> 01:06:47.852
I don't like her to want me anymore.
Because I don't want her anymore.

01:06:58.435 --> 01:07:02.435
<i>As the world waits and worries
about our two journalists in Ecuador,</i>

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:05.560
<i>the whole station joins me
in thinking of Ian Finch,</i>

01:07:05.643 --> 01:07:08.518
<i>- whose birthday it is today.</i>
- Happy birthday.

01:07:08.602 --> 01:07:10.768
- <i>This is Claire Maddox...</i>
- I'd forgotten.

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:12.018
Claire remembered.

01:07:13.852 --> 01:07:14.977
She always does.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:19.352
Everyone's being so nice.

01:07:20.435 --> 01:07:24.018
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.
I'm calling it a day.

01:07:24.102 --> 01:07:26.893
- Calling it a day? Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:29.560
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. I can't do this anymore.

01:07:29.643 --> 01:07:32.727
We can't just walk across the street
and say, "Hi, we're home."

01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:34.102
- No, I know. No.
- Can we?

01:07:34.185 --> 01:07:37.060
We have to get to the U.S. embassy
in Quito.

01:07:37.143 --> 01:07:40.227
Which means,
we have to go to Ecuador for real.

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.750
- Why do we have to go to Ecuador?
- It's that or we go to jail.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.893
Why did we do all this
if we've still gotta go to Ecuador?

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:48.102
This was all your idea, and we didn't know
it was gonna get so out of hand.

01:07:48.185 --> 01:07:49.768
What do we do? How do we get there?

01:07:49.852 --> 01:07:52.893
We gotta get across the country. I guess
we drive. We get to the West Coast.

01:07:52.977 --> 01:07:55.893
From there, we get on a boat
and we go down to Quito.

01:07:55.977 --> 01:07:58.227
Illegally, because we don't
have any passports.

01:07:58.310 --> 01:07:59.310
Oh, God.

01:08:02.393 --> 01:08:04.073
This is a good birthday present, isn't it?

01:08:04.185 --> 01:08:07.185
"Oh, sorry. Happy birthday.
You've gotta go to Quito after all."

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.685
- Thanks for everything.
- Anytime.

01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:19.518
- If you hadn't been there...
- I was there.

01:08:20.393 --> 01:08:24.102
Sure. And don't worry about your car.
I'll get it back to you.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:26.518
Return safely, that's all I ask.

01:08:27.727 --> 01:08:29.727
You give those kidnappers hell.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:32.977
There aren't really... Yeah. Okay.

01:08:35.018 --> 01:08:37.227
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

01:08:44.393 --> 01:08:48.018
- You need money?
- We're on our way to get money.

01:08:48.102 --> 01:08:50.477
- I know where there's lots of money.
- Where?

01:08:59.393 --> 01:09:01.143
- She's in bed.
- I'll wait here.

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:03.768
- It'll be all over in five minutes.
- Well, come in with me.

01:09:03.852 --> 01:09:05.727
- No, we agreed I wouldn't have to.
- Why?

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.435
- We just did.
- But why did we?

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:09.118
- No reason.
- Well, come in with me, then.

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:10.625
- Okay, but don't wake her up.
- Shh.

01:09:18.768 --> 01:09:20.935
- Why do you even have a safe?
- In case I get burgled.

01:09:21.018 --> 01:09:24.602
I've got expensive comics.
I've always wanted one, as well.

01:09:24.685 --> 01:09:25.810
They're really cool.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.393
- How much shall I take?
- A few more, just in case.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.018
Hiya. Uh, surprise.

01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:49.602
Um, Frank Bonneville,
this is my wife, Eleanor.

01:09:50.143 --> 01:09:51.383
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:53.075
Aren't you glad that
we're alive and well?

01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:56.727
See what I mean?
You'd have more chance with her than me.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:58.185
- Definitely not.
- No.

01:09:58.768 --> 01:10:02.143
Before you explain why you're not being
held hostage in Ecuador, tell me,

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:06.060
- why are you stealing my money?
- We need it, to, um,

01:10:06.143 --> 01:10:10.352
bribe our way into Ecuador. To...

01:10:10.435 --> 01:10:15.643
Because I threw away the tickets
and passports at the airport.

01:10:15.727 --> 01:10:17.167
- What do you mean?
- I didn't mean to.

01:10:17.227 --> 01:10:20.310
I thought I was throwing away the letter
that I wrote you. That, um...

01:10:20.393 --> 01:10:22.560
- What are you talking about?
- It's a long story.

01:10:22.643 --> 01:10:24.768
- It's not your money.
- Excuse me?

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:30.518
It's not your money. People gave that
money so we wouldn't be in danger,

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:32.602
but we're not in danger,
so it's their money,

01:10:32.685 --> 01:10:35.727
but they don't need to know that.
So, it's definitely not yours.

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:39.268
So, now I got nothing again.
You ruin everything.

01:10:39.352 --> 01:10:41.935
Well, weren't you gonna spend it anyway,
to pay our ransom?

01:10:42.018 --> 01:10:45.310
Of course.
But, like, you clearly don't need it now.

01:10:45.393 --> 01:10:47.310
You don't care if we live or die.

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.560
You're in your element.
All the fame, all the attention.

01:10:50.643 --> 01:10:54.060
So long as you're still in the picture,
but you can feel it all slipping away.

01:10:54.143 --> 01:10:56.227
That's why you wanna
hold on to all the cash.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:58.435
What? Like you're so perfect.

01:10:59.643 --> 01:11:02.227
Maybe it's time the world knew
a few home truths about you.

01:11:03.227 --> 01:11:05.185
I think they'd learn
even worse things about you.

01:11:06.102 --> 01:11:08.685
- I don't care.
- I think you would.

01:11:15.185 --> 01:11:19.227
Look, how about this?
Let's go 50-50.

01:11:20.018 --> 01:11:23.352
We take our share, get into Ecuador,
turn up at the American embassy,

01:11:23.435 --> 01:11:26.060
say we've been released,
you say you paid the ransom,

01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:28.393
- keep the cash.
- We'll need evidence I paid the ransom.

01:11:28.477 --> 01:11:31.143
We're the evidence. We were kidnapped,
and now we're free.

01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:34.602
They're not gonna expect receipts
from a bunch of Ecuadorian kidnappers.

01:11:34.685 --> 01:11:36.645
- Who did I give the money to?
- You didn't.

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:41.227
You were told to leave it under a bridge
because you...

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.310
didn't wanna involve the police,
because they told you they'd kill us.

01:11:44.393 --> 01:11:47.227
So, you just left the money
for collection under a bridge.

01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:49.185
- What bridge?
- "What bridge"? Any bridge.

01:11:49.268 --> 01:11:50.143
They'll check.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:53.027
They'll find no money there because
the bad men came and took the money

01:11:53.102 --> 01:11:55.977
and gave it to the bad men
that were kidnapping us. It works.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.143
Okay, done.

01:12:00.227 --> 01:12:01.810
- Yeah.
- Get out.

01:14:11.477 --> 01:14:14.018
Oh. Jesus Christ. What was that?

01:14:17.935 --> 01:14:18.935
Bugs.

01:14:30.935 --> 01:14:32.602
- Truck.
- There's a truck.

01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:34.518
Yo! Yo!

01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:37.477
Hi. Hi.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.018
Oh. Hey. Hi.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:41.810
Thanks for stopping.

01:14:41.893 --> 01:14:42.768
- Where you go?
- Quito.

01:14:42.852 --> 01:14:45.412
- We need to get to the embassy.
- We can pay you and everything.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.018
- Ah, Americanos.
- English.

01:14:48.102 --> 01:14:49.822
Although I have lived
and worked in America.

01:14:49.893 --> 01:14:51.693
- Doesn't need your life history.
- Want to eat?

01:14:51.768 --> 01:14:53.768
No, it's fine, we're going
straight to the embassy.

01:14:53.852 --> 01:14:56.227
Embassy a few hours away. I need to eat.

01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:58.352
- I know a good place.
- I'm quite hungry.

01:14:58.435 --> 01:15:01.102
- This guy needs to eat, so...
- Of course. Yeah.

01:15:01.185 --> 01:15:02.560
Okay. Let's go there.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.518
Brilliant, cheers.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:32.435
- It's good.
- Sure.

01:15:39.477 --> 01:15:41.685
Oh, God. Jazz.

01:15:47.227 --> 01:15:50.268
Oh, good. Not jazz after all.

01:15:52.477 --> 01:15:55.602
Hi. Hey. Oh. Nice.

01:15:57.227 --> 01:15:58.227
Morning.

01:15:59.227 --> 01:16:00.352
Hi.

01:16:00.768 --> 01:16:02.435
Hiya. Oh.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.060
Rustic, isn't it?

01:16:07.727 --> 01:16:09.167
No air-conditioning, though.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.977
Makes you drink more,
doesn't it? Crafty.

01:16:13.643 --> 01:16:16.602
- He looks like he's had enough.
- We're gonna eat and then leave.

01:16:16.685 --> 01:16:20.477
Sure. Shall I call for a menu?
Don't know who's working here.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.643
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:16:22.893 --> 01:16:25.393
- Americano?
- Uh, well, English.

01:16:25.477 --> 01:16:27.227
But I, um... Yeah.

01:16:28.477 --> 01:16:32.143
You look handsome. And rich.
You must be very successful.

01:16:32.227 --> 01:16:34.727
- I do okay, babe.
- Let's go.

01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:36.185
Uh, no.

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:40.227
- But, you know, you look tired.
- I am tired.

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.143
Do you want something to wake you up?

01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:43.102
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:16:43.185 --> 01:16:45.560
No. You sniff it.

01:16:47.893 --> 01:16:49.733
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You want some?

01:16:49.768 --> 01:16:51.143
- No, we're going.
- We're not going.

01:16:51.227 --> 01:16:52.977
- We're going!
- We're not going.

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.477
Listen to me. My wife left me, okay?

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.185
Presumably for someone better.
Who isn't better than me?

01:16:58.268 --> 01:17:01.602
Just having a bit of fun, to remind me
that life's worth living.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.852
Give me that, please.

01:17:05.977 --> 01:17:07.143
What the hell.

01:17:10.518 --> 01:17:11.518
Funny, isn't it?

01:17:13.185 --> 01:17:14.810
- Hello.
- Gentlemen.

01:17:14.893 --> 01:17:16.060
Hi.

01:17:16.143 --> 01:17:17.823
- So, you like the sample, eh?
- Thank you.

01:17:17.852 --> 01:17:20.185
- And now, you gotta buy.
- I knew it.

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.685
That's fair enough.

01:17:21.768 --> 01:17:24.935
Gotta make a living. He's given us
a little free sample, you know.

01:17:25.018 --> 01:17:27.977
So, I'll have one.

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:30.602
Thank you. Cheers.
There you go.

01:17:31.602 --> 01:17:33.643
I won't do it now.

01:17:33.727 --> 01:17:36.268
In fact, I think I'd better hide it.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:38.152
I don't want them finding this
at the embassy.

01:17:38.227 --> 01:17:39.810
Don't worry about it. They won't.

01:17:41.143 --> 01:17:42.893
- Shit.
- Come on, let's go, <i>papi.</i>

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.685
Let's go, come on.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.810
- Move.
- Okay.

01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:50.060
- Come on, move!
- Okay.

01:17:50.143 --> 01:17:51.227
Move.

01:17:51.518 --> 01:17:52.602
All right.

01:17:52.685 --> 01:17:54.435
- Let's go.
- Move.

01:17:57.477 --> 01:17:58.643
Keep an eye on them.

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:31.602
Get out. Let's go.
Let's go, get out. Move.

01:18:31.685 --> 01:18:32.685
Okay.

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:38.852
Move. Hey!

01:18:44.143 --> 01:18:47.768
In there. Over there. Over there, move.
Now go. Go, go, go.

01:18:57.227 --> 01:18:59.727
- Look at this.
- Enjoy the view.

01:19:04.643 --> 01:19:07.643
Gotta love tourists.
They're nice people.

01:19:07.727 --> 01:19:09.268
- Very nice.
- Excuse me.

01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:12.643
There's no toilet... in here.

01:19:22.768 --> 01:19:25.102
- Sorry about this.
- Don't worry about it.

01:19:27.268 --> 01:19:28.935
What do you mean,
"don't worry about it"?

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.977
I have to tell you something. Um...

01:19:37.852 --> 01:19:40.560
Probably gonna end up dying here,
and I don't wanna have to die

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:42.810
- with this on my conscience, so...
- What now?

01:19:45.352 --> 01:19:46.477
I'm just gonna say it.

01:19:49.602 --> 01:19:52.768
I slept with your wife, Eleanor.

01:19:54.143 --> 01:19:57.393
- The night of the party.
- No, you didn't. What do you mean?

01:19:57.477 --> 01:20:00.102
- I didn't know who she was.
- You're serious?

01:20:00.185 --> 01:20:01.602
I didn't know she was your wife.

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:09.393
How do you think that makes me feel?
That my wife just...

01:20:09.477 --> 01:20:10.852
- has it off with anyone?
- Hardly.

01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:13.935
The first smarmy bastard who comes along.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:18.227
Just a big phony and a liar and a cheat.
Oh, I feel sick.

01:20:21.852 --> 01:20:24.227
So, you've been laughing at me
behind my back all this time.

01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:27.060
No, not at all. I felt terrible
when I found out. I like you.

01:20:27.143 --> 01:20:30.685
- You got a funny way of showing it.
- I did not know she was your wife.

01:20:30.768 --> 01:20:32.393
- So you keep saying.
- She's the one to blame.

01:20:32.477 --> 01:20:35.685
She knew she was married to you.
She chose not to share that with me.

01:20:38.018 --> 01:20:40.060
So, you wouldn't have done it
if you had known?

01:20:40.143 --> 01:20:43.185
Of course not. What do you think of me?

01:20:43.268 --> 01:20:46.060
Maybe she'll really
try and get us out now.

01:20:46.143 --> 01:20:48.810
She'll be killing two birds
with one stone, won't she?

01:20:48.893 --> 01:20:50.852
She'll be getting her husband back
and her lover.

01:21:10.768 --> 01:21:11.852
Morning.

01:21:14.018 --> 01:21:17.602
Hey, man, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have said
anything. I thought you were over her.

01:21:17.685 --> 01:21:21.477
I am over her, so, don't say anything.
Let's just get through this.

01:21:28.768 --> 01:21:29.768
You okay?

01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:34.018
Go.

01:21:40.477 --> 01:21:41.685
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:43.685
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:46.518
- Have you got any bread?
- It's not room service.

01:21:47.143 --> 01:21:49.602
- Are you a prisoner, too?
- Of course he's a prisoner.

01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:51.935
- Maybe he can help.
- He can't help, look at him.

01:21:52.018 --> 01:21:54.352
He is helping us.
He brought us food, didn't he?

01:21:54.435 --> 01:21:57.935
- Let him go. He's terrified.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:05.477
Chili for breakfast.

01:22:08.685 --> 01:22:10.435
Oh. It's really hot as well.

01:22:10.518 --> 01:22:12.602
Mm.

01:22:25.185 --> 01:22:27.145
If you hold your nose,
you can't taste it as much.

01:22:27.227 --> 01:22:28.768
Really?

01:22:30.143 --> 01:22:32.477
- Who do you think these people are?
- They're bandits.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.893
They're gonna ask for ransom.

01:22:33.977 --> 01:22:36.060
- Who's gonna pay that?
- I don't know. Government?

01:22:36.143 --> 01:22:37.863
- Not the U.S. government.
- What do you mean?

01:22:37.935 --> 01:22:39.735
- They don't negotiate with terrorists.
- Why?

01:22:45.685 --> 01:22:47.518
- Journalist, okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:47.602 --> 01:22:51.518
- And you?
- No. Uh, I'm a technician.

01:22:51.602 --> 01:22:54.310
- Is your boss rich?
- No, not at all.

01:22:54.393 --> 01:22:56.935
- Is your family rich?
- No.

01:22:57.643 --> 01:23:01.477
My wife has got cash, at the moment.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:03.685
- She has, she's got loads.
- Your wife?

01:23:03.768 --> 01:23:07.060
Mm. She'll pay, then you'll release us,
yeah? Unharmed.

01:23:07.143 --> 01:23:09.268
- Yeah, of course.
- Don't... Yeah. Okay.

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:12.185
You're gonna call your wife, okay?

01:23:12.268 --> 01:23:13.518
- Okay.
- Call her.

01:23:13.602 --> 01:23:16.893
- She's never gonna believe him.
- Shh. Let's keep it positive.

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:19.810
- What do you say to him?
- Call your wife.

01:23:19.893 --> 01:23:22.143
- Good. Good.
- I am.

01:23:22.227 --> 01:23:25.935
- How much money do you want?
- 100,000 for each of you.

01:23:26.018 --> 01:23:27.518
- That's a lot.
- Shh.

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.893
Well, it is. I'm saying.

01:23:28.977 --> 01:23:31.643
I'm not gonna promise anything,
but we're gonna get you what...

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.852
- Hello?
<i>- Eleanor.</i>

01:23:44.435 --> 01:23:47.102
- What do you want?
- Right, we're in Ecuador,

01:23:47.185 --> 01:23:52.685
and we've been captured by bandits
and they want $200,000

01:23:52.768 --> 01:23:56.143
<i>- or they're gonna kill me and Frank.</i>
- Stop it. Where are you calling me from?

01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.643
- Where are we exactly? She wants to know.
- $300,000.

01:23:59.727 --> 01:24:03.102
Hear that? He put it up. That's what
we're dealing with, unreasonable.

01:24:03.185 --> 01:24:05.727
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm keeping that money.

01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:08.727
I raised it, I gave you your half.
Stop trying to con me out of mine.

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.935
She thinks we're conning her.
She doesn't believe me.

01:24:11.018 --> 01:24:13.518
- She thinks we're trying to get her money.
- She doesn't trust him.

01:24:13.602 --> 01:24:15.602
- You gotta talk to her.
- You talk to her.

01:24:15.643 --> 01:24:18.685
- Talk to her, please.
- I'm gonna hand you to the head bandit.

01:24:18.768 --> 01:24:21.560
<i>Bandido. </i> So, you speak to her.

01:24:23.477 --> 01:24:24.977
- Hello, ma'am.
- Eleanor.

01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:27.102
- What's that?
- Eleanor.

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:28.393
Eleanor.

01:24:29.018 --> 01:24:34.310
Eleanor, if you don't pay, I'm gonna
kill your husband and Mr. Franks.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.727
Kill everybody. Greetings from New York.

01:24:40.977 --> 01:24:44.227
- What'd she say?
- She said to kill you all.

01:24:45.727 --> 01:24:47.435
- She said that?
- She said that, yeah.

01:24:47.518 --> 01:24:49.318
- That's what I'm dealing with.
- Who is this?

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:51.893
- That's my wife.
- Your wife makes me very sad.

01:24:51.977 --> 01:24:54.817
Welcome to my world, son. I'm glad
you spoke to her, though, first-hand.

01:24:54.893 --> 01:24:56.685
- Urgh!
- I know. She's...

01:24:56.768 --> 01:24:58.102
Yeah.

01:25:03.185 --> 01:25:04.602
That's nice, isn't it? "Kill them."

01:25:04.685 --> 01:25:07.602
I can't believe she just did that.
She hung up?

01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:09.045
She said, "Kill them." And then...

01:25:12.227 --> 01:25:14.947
- We gotta be professional.
- I was professional.

01:25:15.018 --> 01:25:16.560
You were not professional.

01:25:16.643 --> 01:25:18.403
I did exactly what you told me to.

01:25:20.518 --> 01:25:21.518
Thank you.

01:25:25.643 --> 01:25:27.560
What the fuck did you just do?

01:25:28.352 --> 01:25:29.685
Hey, come on. Hey!

01:25:29.768 --> 01:25:32.102
- No, no, no. Is okay. Is okay.
- Sorry.

01:25:35.185 --> 01:25:37.560
- Who the fuck are you talking to?
- Nothing.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.852
He's sorry. We're sorry. Sorry.

01:25:57.893 --> 01:26:01.185
- What are you thinking?
- Thinking that chili was definitely off.

01:26:01.893 --> 01:26:08.102
Speed of sound is about
350 meters per second, a bit less.

01:26:09.143 --> 01:26:13.185
A bullet is about 400 meters per second.

01:26:15.852 --> 01:26:20.227
So, if they shoot us,
we'll be dead before we hear the bang.

01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:23.727
- Great. So, we won't jump, then.
- No.

01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:29.143
- I'm scared.
- You weren't yesterday, in the bar.

01:26:29.227 --> 01:26:30.560
That was the cocaine.

01:26:37.602 --> 01:26:38.643
Look.

01:26:39.643 --> 01:26:43.060
Maybe this will make me
a little bit braver again.

01:26:43.143 --> 01:26:44.227
Popeye on spinach.

01:26:50.852 --> 01:26:52.018
Where is it?

01:26:53.018 --> 01:26:55.143
Your sweat probably dissolved it.

01:27:01.643 --> 01:27:07.268
- I can taste it. Do you want some?
- Yeah. Why don't I suck your toes, too?

01:27:08.018 --> 01:27:09.060
No.

01:27:17.602 --> 01:27:18.643
Mm.

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:20.685
It's all coming out.

01:27:25.685 --> 01:27:26.893
Ah.

01:27:35.185 --> 01:27:37.643
Ah. I've got, like, a toothache all over.

01:27:41.018 --> 01:27:42.852
- That was way too much for one.
- How's your heart?

01:27:42.935 --> 01:27:45.852
Yeah, it feels like
my heart's in my brain.

01:27:45.935 --> 01:27:47.310
- How's your balls?
- Non-existent.

01:27:47.393 --> 01:27:48.643
<i>They've shrunk. And the willy.</i>

01:27:48.727 --> 01:27:51.435
It's like a little snail
going into its shell. Dense.

01:27:51.518 --> 01:27:54.810
It's like the same matter
in a much smaller...

01:27:54.893 --> 01:27:56.413
They're the least of my problems. I...

01:27:57.518 --> 01:28:01.268
Oh, my God. I feel like I'm gonna burst.
If you feel bad, it makes it bad.

01:28:01.352 --> 01:28:03.072
- If you feel good, you feel good.
- You okay?

01:28:03.143 --> 01:28:06.477
You feel good, and if bad, it's the, um...
Uh... Oh, God.

01:28:09.227 --> 01:28:12.435
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah. Better not, because they're...

01:28:12.518 --> 01:28:16.685
Fucking, like, "Hey, man."
Fuck you. You're nothing but a bitch.

01:28:16.768 --> 01:28:17.810
Gonna slap them.

01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:21.018
They're pussies, really.

01:28:21.102 --> 01:28:24.477
They come in, "Fuck you.
No, give me that." Fuck off, you bitch.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.518
Suck my balls.

01:28:30.143 --> 01:28:31.183
I've got terrible gut rot.

01:28:31.227 --> 01:28:34.352
Motorhead, "Ace of Spades."

01:28:34.435 --> 01:28:36.060
That's what I call myself
on <i>Rebel Coup</i>.

01:28:36.143 --> 01:28:39.518
- "Ace of Spades." That's a good omen.
- Great omen.

01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:43.227
So, you have no one that loves you

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:46.102
that is willing to pay money
to get you back.

01:28:46.185 --> 01:28:48.852
Completely useless to us. Worthless.

01:28:48.935 --> 01:28:51.685
We might as well get
some entertainment out of you.

01:28:51.768 --> 01:28:55.060
You two are fighting to the death.
Come on, get up.

01:28:55.852 --> 01:28:57.018
Can I use the toilet, please?

01:28:58.643 --> 01:29:00.310
- I need to...
- Come on, get up.

01:29:00.393 --> 01:29:02.685
What do you mean fight to the death?
That's ridiculous.

01:29:02.768 --> 01:29:04.685
- That's right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:29:04.768 --> 01:29:05.768
You're gonna shoot me?

01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:08.227
The other ones
are going to hear the shots,

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:11.268
they're gonna come in here:
pop, pop, pop.

01:29:11.352 --> 01:29:13.633
- Shoot you to bits.
- I don't care. We're gonna die anyway.

01:29:13.685 --> 01:29:16.643
No. Only one of you will die, you see?

01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:21.268
You're gonna fight each other
to the death. The winner will be free.

01:29:21.352 --> 01:29:22.602
Shoot him.

01:29:25.227 --> 01:29:26.268
Shoot him.

01:29:28.518 --> 01:29:30.185
You're thinking you'd win, aren't you?

01:29:30.977 --> 01:29:32.352
- I would win.
- You don't know that.

01:29:32.435 --> 01:29:34.310
- He definitely will.
- You don't know that.

01:29:34.393 --> 01:29:36.935
- Look at you and look at him.
- You don't know what I can do.

01:29:37.018 --> 01:29:38.602
So, don't... Just...

01:29:49.143 --> 01:29:51.768
- I can't do it.
- Oh, God. Give it to me.

01:29:58.352 --> 01:30:00.727
Are you gonna shoot me now?
This is just...

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:02.852
It's not as easy as it looks, right?

01:30:10.685 --> 01:30:13.143
Oh, I've shit myself.

01:30:14.185 --> 01:30:18.143
Oh, fuck! Fucking...
My fucking balls!

01:30:18.227 --> 01:30:20.477
Fuck, you shot my fucking balls, man.

01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:28.227
Aah!

01:30:28.435 --> 01:30:29.685
The Jeep!

01:30:49.893 --> 01:30:52.393
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:30:54.768 --> 01:30:56.768
Whoo!

01:31:00.352 --> 01:31:02.352
Whoo-hoo!

01:31:02.435 --> 01:31:04.685
Whoo!

01:31:04.768 --> 01:31:06.560
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

01:31:19.602 --> 01:31:21.643
<i>Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch,</i>

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:26.352
<i>the two radio employees held hostage
for nearly a month, have been released.</i>

01:31:26.435 --> 01:31:28.477
<i>They were welcomed
at the U.S. embassy in Quito</i>

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.685
<i>and are said to be exhausted,
but unharmed and in good spirits.</i>

01:31:32.768 --> 01:31:36.727
<i>The Ecuadorian Liberation Front
claim responsibility for the kidnapping</i>

01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:39.768
<i>and are believed to have been paid
their ransom by Eleanor Finch</i>

01:31:39.852 --> 01:31:42.852
<i>- from the public's generous donations.</i>
- Thank you.

01:31:42.935 --> 01:31:46.768
<i>This is Q365 News, saying:
welcome home, boys.</i>

01:32:07.852 --> 01:32:10.185
You must be so proud.

01:32:10.268 --> 01:32:13.435
I am. It's probably
the best song I've written.

01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:33.602
Frank, welcome back.

01:32:35.352 --> 01:32:37.018
I was wrong about you.

01:32:37.102 --> 01:32:39.602
Which part? The bit about
being a drunk, arrogant hack

01:32:39.685 --> 01:32:41.477
- who doesn't care about anybody?
- Yeah.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.435
No, you weren't.
I'm a work in progress.

01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:47.393
- Hmm.
- And Finch finally did something brave.

01:32:47.477 --> 01:32:48.560
Really?

01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:50.852
Not yet.

01:32:56.643 --> 01:32:57.893
Hey.

01:32:58.977 --> 01:33:02.560
Don't worry. We'll never tell anyone
you weren't really kidnapped.

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:04.768
- No, we were kidnapped.
- Of course.

01:33:04.852 --> 01:33:06.268
Sure.

01:33:06.352 --> 01:33:09.435
Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Bonneville.

01:33:12.227 --> 01:33:14.727
Well, thank you. Thank you. Uh...

01:33:15.977 --> 01:33:19.602
He's the one you should be applauding,
because let me tell you something...

01:33:20.477 --> 01:33:25.143
Ian Finch is a hero. Okay?

01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:33.602
He may look like a squat, ineffectual
nobody, but he is the real man here.

01:33:36.685 --> 01:33:38.525
What's it like
to have your husband back?

01:33:38.602 --> 01:33:41.727
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Great. It's so great.

01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:43.170
And what's next for Eleanor Finch?

01:33:43.227 --> 01:33:46.143
Um, well, my album is due out,
as you know,

01:33:46.227 --> 01:33:48.185
and I'm starting a perfume line.

01:33:48.268 --> 01:33:51.977
...I thought I'd never get to see
my own country again.

01:33:57.643 --> 01:33:59.393
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:33:59.477 --> 01:34:02.602
- Brought you a coffee.
- Why?

01:34:03.227 --> 01:34:06.102
Well, because you always
bring me a coffee.

01:34:07.143 --> 01:34:08.643
I bring everyone coffee.

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:10.102
- Do you?
- No.

01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:13.852
Good. Good work with the...

01:34:15.352 --> 01:34:16.518
Uh...

01:34:19.643 --> 01:34:21.602
Uh... Um...

01:34:24.102 --> 01:34:26.060
Exactly, that's what I was trying to say.

01:34:27.643 --> 01:34:29.310
- This is going well.
- Yeah.

01:34:29.393 --> 01:34:30.685
Isn't it?

01:34:30.768 --> 01:34:34.310
I'm just gonna uh... walk past...

01:34:34.393 --> 01:34:35.935
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:34:36.018 --> 01:34:40.185
...these people,
who would probably give us a lift.

01:34:40.268 --> 01:34:42.602
But we seem to be
walking to Manhattan.

01:34:42.685 --> 01:34:44.852
Is that good?

01:34:47.852 --> 01:34:51.227
- I have coffee, so...
- You didn't want milk, did you?

01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:53.185
- I did, but...
- Okay, good. Well, we...

01:34:53.268 --> 01:34:56.810
There's a shop on the Upper East Side
that I know.

01:34:57.518 --> 01:34:59.935
We're probably not allowed
to go across there.

01:35:01.685 --> 01:35:03.768
This is like the end of a movie.

01:35:04.935 --> 01:35:07.018
<i>A low-budget movie, maybe.</i>
