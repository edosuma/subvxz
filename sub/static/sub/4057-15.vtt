WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.512
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.536 --> 00:04.514
Lydia, you have to wake up.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.550
There's no way we're getting
through this without you.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.654
Hey, what if the Dread
Doctors are hiding the bodies.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.955
Maybe they're protecting it
like a parent would.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.191
Protecting what?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.215
It's called the Beast.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.482
The Beast of Gevaudan.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.999
Giant wolf.
Shapeless, like a shadow.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.834
- What are they?
- It's all of us.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.491
Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.542
Corinne! You kill her
now and we get nothing.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.344
I killed my own family
because of you.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.901
I'm your family, sweetheart.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.015
Wait a second, what is this?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.166
They shaved her head.

00:40.190 --> 00:42.190
What are they gonna do?
Drill a hole into her head?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.010
Now we get Lydia.

01:14.041 --> 01:17.854
Unit Five heading northwest on
Crescent reporting an incredibly large...

01:17.878 --> 01:18.878
Something.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.425
Unit Nine, to Dispatch,

01:22.449 --> 01:23.927
I think I've got eyes
on the same thing.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.217
Some kind of rabid animal.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.154
Unit Five to Nine,
trust me, that's no animal.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.938
Unit Six to Dispatch.
We have a situation downtown.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.139
Multiple fatalities.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.440
Copy, medics on the way.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.709
Do you have a perp
in sight, Unit Six?

01:39.733 --> 01:42.212
Negative. Looks like
a 10-91E. Animal attack.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.036
10-4, can you say
what kind of animal?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.655
All units stay back.
Do not engage.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.890
I repeat, do not engage.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.147
Stiles, get off the radio.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.229
All unit alert.
Wait for back-up.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.299
Repeat, no one goes
near this thing.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.468
Unit Five reporting a sighting
on Hill Road southbound...

02:05.492 --> 02:07.337
Unit Nine, I've got it
turning off Oakridge,

02:07.361 --> 02:09.239
southbound on Beachwood...

02:09.263 --> 02:11.308
All units, this is Dispatch.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.865
We've got a 911 call with
additional sighting on Mitchell.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.150
Wait a second?
Beachwood to Mitchell?

02:20.174 --> 02:22.252
It's headed back
for the hospital.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.376
Dad... Stiles, get
off this channel.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.990
Dad, just listen to me, okay?

02:27.014 --> 02:27.957
It's headed for
the hospital, all right.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.693
He's headed for Beacon Memorial.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.357
You hear me?
It's headed for the hospital.

02:36.457 --> 02:40.170
Again, this is a Code White,
a full hospital evacuation.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.029
All critical patients will be
taken by ambulance to Hill Valley.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.588
Unit Five, Clark,
I need eyes on Parrish.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.757
Does anyone have Parrish's 20?

03:33.781 --> 03:36.393
All units,
we have a 911 emergency call

03:36.417 --> 03:40.029
reporting a man on fire
running into Beacon Memorial.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.486
Clark, disregard.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.937
Fourth floor.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.661
Parrish? You okay?

04:58.599 --> 04:59.664
Deputy!

06:19.346 --> 06:22.247
What I'm about to show you
isn't supposed to exist.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.202
This is the only surviving
evidence of Dr. Valack's time

06:33.226 --> 06:35.660
as Chief Medical Officer
of Eichen House.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.601
To call it human experimentation
would be charitable.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.177
A Banshee.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.946
She died screaming.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.969
So, he drilled holes into
their heads? All of them?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.492
That was
the experimentation part.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.108
He did it to Werewolves,

07:12.132 --> 07:15.378
Banshees, Wendigos,

07:15.402 --> 07:17.814
any creature he could
get his hands on.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.882
And Valack found
that trepanation

07:19.906 --> 07:21.417
would initially
heighten their powers,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.753
but to levels that
couldn't be contained.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.456
So he wants to make
Lydia more powerful.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.240
Yeah. Except she's going
to end up like them.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.495
Worse, actually.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.331
Lydia's abilities were already
pretty exceptional to begin with.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.400
Putting a hole in her head

07:37.424 --> 07:39.758
will be like causing a leak
in a nuclear reactor.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.072
She'll hear everything.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.430
Every death, every dying scream,

07:46.433 --> 07:48.011
all at once.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.434
That's going to kill her.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.403
Not only that...

07:52.973 --> 07:55.351
Her own dying scream

07:55.375 --> 07:58.677
could be so powerful that it might
kill everyone around her as well.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.802
I'm doing everything I can, but
her mom is her legal guardian.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.004
She's the only person who can
check her out of Eichen House.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.006
Can't we get a court
order or something?

08:17.030 --> 08:20.710
Technically, trepanation is still
considered a medical procedure.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.880
A judge would have to declare
Natalie unfit, which isn't likely.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.615
It could all take months.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.051
So you're saying there's
nothing we can do.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.275
I'm saying there's
nothing we can do...

08:31.545 --> 08:32.544
Legally.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.691
There's four steps.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.793
We get into Eichen,
we get into the Closed Unit,

08:36.817 --> 08:38.528
we get Lydia, get out.

08:38.552 --> 08:41.063
And we have to do it all of
this while getting past orderlies,

08:41.087 --> 08:43.032
guards, electric door locks,

08:43.056 --> 08:44.232
and a Mountain Ash barrier.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.590
You have a plan for all of that?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.871
I stole this last night
off an orderly.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.741
But it's useless 'cause they
reset the codes each night.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.310
So why did you take it?
I'm getting to that.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.380
The only way to get Lydia out of Eichen
is to make that key card work again.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.481
How are you going to do that?

08:58.505 --> 09:00.883
We're getting to that,
okay, just listen.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.919
I pulled all the history
off the key card.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.089
Two weeks ago, there was a brownout
and the security system rebooted.

09:06.113 --> 09:09.192
During a reboot, all of the key
cards revert back to a default code.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.227
So, if we trigger a reboot...

09:11.251 --> 09:12.862
The card goes back
to the default code.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.119
It works again.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.570
How are we going
to cause a brownout?

09:20.594 --> 09:21.671
That's your part.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.239
You're going to draw
power from the main line.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.707
But only enough
to cause the brownout.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.609
Not a blackout.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.211
Do that and you send Eichen
into lockdown which would be bad.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.846
Very, very bad.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.549
There's an electrical room
behind the reception counter.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.533
The main power line goes into two
breakers that run power to all of Eichen.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.427
Okay, slight problem.
I don't know how to do that.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.262
That's okay. You have
time to practice.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.231
Let's say all this
goes perfectly.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.889
How does a brownout get us
into the Closed Unit of Eichen?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.737
The system takes
five minutes to reboot.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.140
In that five minutes all
the alarms will be turned off

09:57.164 --> 09:58.908
the key card should work.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.213
Liam, you and I get Stiles
to the gate of the Closed Unit.

10:05.838 --> 10:06.649
But after that,
he has to go on his own.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.353
We can't get past
the Mountain Ash barrier.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.391
And when we're gone,

10:15.415 --> 10:17.126
all anyone's going to think
is that there was a reboot

10:17.150 --> 10:19.050
of the security system
caused by a brownout.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.131
Uh, any questions?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.833
How do we get into Eichen
House in the first place?

10:23.857 --> 10:24.967
What's our worst-case scenario?

10:24.991 --> 10:26.068
What if I can't do it?

10:26.092 --> 10:28.104
Okay, admittedly,
a lot could go wrong.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.472
Everything could go wrong.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.675
Guys, if we don't do this,

10:32.699 --> 10:33.976
we lose Lydia.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.400
She's going to die
in there tonight.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.404
And she might take a lot
of innocent people with her.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.401
Have you ever actually
put that thing on someone?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.774
Not in years.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.613
Close the doors, would you?

11:24.050 --> 11:25.728
How do you know it still works?

11:25.752 --> 11:27.296
I don't.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.753
I suppose we should
give it a try.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.226
What?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.828
Do it. Do your thing.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.397
What thing?
I don't have a thing.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.521
You did it before.
You had to learn how, right?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.156
Actually, no.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.503
It just happened.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.272
How'd you learn
to fight with a sword?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.240
That just kind of happened too.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.299
So you've never worked for anything
and basically you're a cheater?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.746
This wasn't my idea.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.447
How are we even
getting past the front gate?

12:18.471 --> 12:20.783
I have a guy on the inside.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.607
And stop changing
the subject. Do your thing.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.353
It didn't work.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.694
No, it didn't.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.215
Just promise you're not
coming back in one of these.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.177
We're coming back with Lydia.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.546
Okay.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.416
We still don't know
who's actually doing this.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.764
Who the Beast is.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.887
We'll find out.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.302
You think it's someone we know?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.770
I hope not.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.472
You think he even
knows he's doing it?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.363
How are you so sure it's a he?

13:20.834 --> 13:21.811
You still mad at me?

13:21.835 --> 13:22.900
No.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.748
But if you try
to kill my son again,

13:25.772 --> 13:27.172
I'll put you in one
of these myself.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.810
She's still mad.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.492
That's the worst plan
I've ever heard.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.960
Okay, the plan is perfect

13:37.984 --> 13:39.462
and it'll work perfectly,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.219
especially if you agree
to drive the van.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.867
Is the Sheriff
on board with this?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.268
How do you think I got the keys?

13:46.292 --> 13:47.636
I thought you stole them.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.271
While that's a perfectly
reasonable assumption,

13:49.295 --> 13:50.973
I did not steal them.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.808
And we need you because
all of the Eichen guards

13:52.832 --> 13:54.176
know all of the
Sheriff's Deputies, okay.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.644
We need a real deputy.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.780
And one who won't ask questions.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.370
It's not safe to bring me along.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.387
I'm dangerous.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.123
So is the giant murdering
werewolf that's killed over 30 people,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.579
but somehow didn't kill you.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.723
Can I ask you a question?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.237
No.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.406
Did your mother
really try to kill you?

14:23.430 --> 14:26.008
Did your mother try to leave you
in the desert with Skinwalkers?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.832
Are you really going
to try to kill her first?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.838
Why'd you take off the goggles?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.215
Because this time
you're gonna do it.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.943
And it's gonna work.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.901
Because this is the only way we're
getting Lydia out of Eichen House.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.525
Kira, it's working.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.633
We should go. Yeah.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.463
My Dad's got the lab
working on the shoe prints.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.565
But, uh we're both
kind of mystified about

15:22.589 --> 15:25.868
how giant clawed werewolf feet
turn back into a pair of sneakers.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.137
Argent said it wouldn't be like
anything we've ever seen before.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.661
Did he say it was going to
defy the laws of physics?

15:33.399 --> 15:34.732
What are you doing here?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.247
I still need to graduate.

15:38.271 --> 15:42.451
No. No. What you need is to be
beaten severely with a lead pipe

15:42.475 --> 15:44.053
wrapped in barbed wire...

15:44.077 --> 15:45.621
Okay, I admit that
mistakes were made.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.257
Murders. Some murders were made.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.594
You know how the Soviets
helped us win World War II?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.296
They knew how to make it
through a Russian winter.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.099
That it? Okay. Thank
you, Theo. Very informative.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.901
If you're planning to break
Lydia out of Eichen House,

15:58.925 --> 16:00.645
you still need to get
past the Mountain Ash.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.339
We can make it through.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.740
You can't, Scott.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.008
What do you really want?

16:06.032 --> 16:07.843
I know you saw the fresco.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.678
Two seriously
pissed off creatures,

16:09.702 --> 16:10.846
the Hellhound and the Beast,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.849
fighting over a pile
of dead bodies.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.651
I don't want to be one of
the bodies, it's that simple.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.275
I can get you to Lydia.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.746
Or we can see
who gets to her first.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.664
There's no way he knows
what Valack's doing.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.033
Why's he so interested in her?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.635
He probably thinks
what we're all thinking.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.619
That Lydia's got something
bigger to do with this.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.309
That maybe she's the only one
who can actually save us.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.045
I appreciate you sharing your
thoughts, but if you don't mind,

16:43.069 --> 16:45.781
I have recommendations to write.

16:45.805 --> 16:49.051
Natalie, you know
what's going on.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.853
You know about the
Closed Unit in Eichen House.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.117
And you know what's down there.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.724
I know how to survive
in Beacon Hills.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.825
That's what I know.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.916
Then just check on her.
What if I'm right?

17:02.855 --> 17:05.467
You know, my
mother-in-law, Lorraine,

17:05.491 --> 17:07.336
predicted her wife's death.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.040
And when I was in college, I
was overcome with this feeling

17:11.064 --> 17:13.064
that something terrible
was happening to my sister.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.078
When I called her,
she was in the hospital

17:16.102 --> 17:18.146
with a burst appendix.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.683
These moments
happen for everyone.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.050
And you know what
they're called?

17:22.075 --> 17:24.019
Undeniable proof
of the supernatural?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.042
Coincidence.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.811
Take a look at this.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.251
It might expand your
definition of, uh, coincidence.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.444
She took out the whole school?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.746
She took out the whole grid.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.503
Look, I failed every
single practice try.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.718
This isn't going to work.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.720
How far can we get
without the brownout?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.388
The front door. We're going.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.057
Scott, we went through
boxes of light bulbs.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.114
It doesn't matter.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.527
You can do this.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.062
The key card won't work
unless there's a reboot.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.686
And there's no reboot
without a brownout.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.888
I know you can do this.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.861
Anyone here think she can't?

18:20.066 --> 18:21.944
Not me.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.467
I was the one who
put you in the plan.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.653
What?

18:31.677 --> 18:32.655
"I believe in you too, Kira."

18:32.679 --> 18:35.359
I'm the one who's going to be
locked in an electrical room with her.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.583
You can do it.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.528
You guys are all crazy.
We're gonna die.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.146
Please remember
to follow visitor procedure.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.448
Eichen House has
a wide range of patients

18:59.472 --> 19:01.784
and we cannot
guarantee the safety of those

19:01.808 --> 19:04.008
who deviate from the rules.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.901
Delivery to the morgue.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.944
I don't see you on the list.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.787
You heard about
the animal attacks, right?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.828
The hospital ran out
of refrigerated drawers

19:45.852 --> 19:48.464
and Eichen's got the only other
up-to-code morgue in the county.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.832
Let's have a look.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.367
I don't think you
want to do that.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.503
The stench back there almost
made me pass out while driving.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.260
Open the back
of the van, please.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.979
I'll need to log
the names off the toe tags.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.227
There's significant decomp.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.828
They were found in the county
tunnels way past rigor.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.285
Open them up, please.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.525
No, no.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.881
Go, just go.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.839
Not again, Nelson.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.114
- It's natural.
- So is 50,000 volts.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.945
Oh, my God.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.348
Never again.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.186
Fifteen minutes. Starting now.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.273
We're in. We did it.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.297
Don't get too excited.
Getting out's the hard part.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.065
Twelve minutes.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.447
Okay, Kira. You can do this.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.271
I think it's these.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.928
But they're covered in rubber.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.717
You want to
electrocute yourself?

23:28.741 --> 23:29.807
I'll heal.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.443
Not if you die.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.218
I didn't die.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.791
Four minutes.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.888
What are they doing there?

24:06.912 --> 24:09.346
I don't know. Their rounds
should've ended five minutes ago.

24:13.024 --> 24:14.024
I can take them.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.431
No one's taking anyone.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.455
How much time?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.136
Three minutes.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.060
I'll just knock them out
and hide the bodies.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.029
Oh, my God, please stop.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.332
Did you take the doctor?

24:30.336 --> 24:31.669
What? Did you take the doctor?

24:33.372 --> 24:36.284
I haven't had my medication.
I need ten milligrams at 8am,

24:36.308 --> 24:38.854
15 milligrams at 1pm, and
no more than 20 at dinner.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.577
We'll get the doctor...
Dr. Fenris.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.747
Dr. Fenris.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.750
They took Dr. Fenris.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.369
I can smell how nervous you are.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.559
Not helping.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.261
Okay.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.198
You can do this.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.613
It's just like we practiced.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.782
You mean like when I
caused a major blackout?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.238
Not like that, no.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.714
Ten seconds. Nine,

25:18.484 --> 25:20.317
eight... Please stop counting.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.075
Why isn't it working?

25:33.099 --> 25:34.998
Because I have no idea
what I'm doing.

25:40.506 --> 25:43.051
I haven't had my medication.
I need to see the doctor.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.020
They took Dr. Fenris.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.988
Hey, somebody shut him up.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.012
I need to see the doctor.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.448
Shut him up.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.564
Come on.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.518
Kira, nothing's happening.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.254
I'm aware of that. I
don't want to lose control

26:19.278 --> 26:21.198
because I'm scared I might
fry the entire system.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.849
Stop worrying about
what you might do.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.353
This isn't about you or me.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.657
It's about Lydia.
We're here to save Lydia.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.662
We're here to save our friend.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.149
Kira, it's working.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.419
Keep going.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.959
She did it. Kira did it.
Five minutes to get to Lydia.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.110
Where's the card reader?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.694
It should be here.
It has to be here.

27:32.718 --> 27:35.664
They must have taken it out when
the Dread Doctors got through.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.265
Are you telling me we
came all the way down here

27:37.289 --> 27:39.923
just to be stopped by an
ordinary key? Are you kidding me?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.559
We don't need a key.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.353
Not if we can break it down.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.182
South gate clear, over.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.819
Do I make you nervous?

28:30.843 --> 28:33.110
Shouldn't you already
know the answer to that?

28:34.713 --> 28:37.492
Well, I thought it would be
more polite to ask.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.160
But yes,

28:39.184 --> 28:41.763
a girl your age shouldn't
have a resting heart rate

28:41.787 --> 28:43.520
of a 110 beats per minute.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.126
How about you unshackle
me from this thing

28:50.763 --> 28:52.763
and we'll both be
a little more at ease?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.846
How stupid do you think I am?

28:57.870 --> 29:01.716
Since I highly doubt you want me
to answer that question honestly,

29:01.740 --> 29:04.541
let me propose an alternative.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.312
You set me free

29:09.715 --> 29:11.793
and I'll tell you a secret

29:11.817 --> 29:15.319
about those talons
sitting in that jar over there.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.702
I may be blind,

29:20.726 --> 29:23.727
but my other senses paint
a very detailed picture.

29:27.666 --> 29:31.301
I know the talons were created
by the Dread Doctors.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.716
So what?

29:34.740 --> 29:39.421
So Theo believes he can
fit them onto his own claws

29:39.445 --> 29:42.824
like a couple of press-on nails?

29:42.848 --> 29:46.428
Use them to siphon
the power from the Beast?

29:46.452 --> 29:48.018
Good luck with that.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.934
What do you mean?

29:52.958 --> 29:56.593
The Dread Doctors would have designed
those talons with a specific frequency.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.396
For a specific person.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.179
As a genetic Chimera yourself,

30:04.203 --> 30:05.947
I would've thought
you'd understand

30:05.971 --> 30:08.238
how often the body
rejects an organ.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.909
Especially from
an outside donor.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.551
If he puts them on, then...

30:22.988 --> 30:26.757
Yes, Hayden. They'll kill him.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.593
Guys, we're running out of time.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.954
We can't. The Mountain Ash.
It's too much.

31:02.928 --> 31:04.327
Hit me.

31:04.663 --> 31:05.829
What?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.166
Hit me.

31:10.569 --> 31:13.070
I'll get angry
then I'll get stronger.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.251
Hit him. Hit him!

31:16.275 --> 31:18.008
I tried to take your powers.

31:18.744 --> 31:19.810
I tried to kill you.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.424
Hit me.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.025
He also left you for dead.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.049
I wanted you dead.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.188
Do it again.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.832
It's gotta be harder than that.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.259
Do it!

31:38.564 --> 31:39.696
Do it!

31:43.535 --> 31:44.601
Yeah!

31:50.709 --> 31:51.775
You angry?

31:56.281 --> 31:58.381
Let's do this.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.457
Stiles, go.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.229
Only two minutes.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.611
Stiles...

32:30.582 --> 32:32.082
You can't be here.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.159
You're going to die if you stay.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.695
All of you.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.254
Those guards shouldn't be there.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.256
We could get past them.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.848
We could. But we don't want to
set off any alarm until Lydia is out.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.597
Perimeter security,
check in please.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.254
Perimeter, do you copy?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.607
Stiles, he's coming.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.109
Lydia, I'm not leaving you here.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.133
You have to.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.103
Stiles, go.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.541
Please.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.344
Visiting hours
are well past over.

34:09.715 --> 34:10.981
We're not here to visit.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.087
We're here for Lydia Martin.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.085
Hello?

34:38.110 --> 34:40.121
Hello?

34:40.145 --> 34:43.612
Hello, this is Natalie Martin. I need
to see my daughter immediately.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.882
Open the gate.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.455
It's started.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.590
We need to get you out of here.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.325
What about the others?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.389
They should already be
back at the morgue. Let's go.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.727
Stay focused, Lydia.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.644
What did you do to me?

35:36.668 --> 35:38.579
I've amplified your abilities.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.937
Something that might just
save the lives of your friends.

35:42.674 --> 35:47.255
Theo and Hayden. They found it.

35:47.279 --> 35:51.826
They were looking for Noah,
but they found a symbol.

35:51.850 --> 35:56.497
A circle inside of another
circle, carved into a wall.

35:56.521 --> 35:59.889
The symbol of Scott's pack.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.371
It was more
than a symbol, wasn't it?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.228
It was a promise
to reunite them.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.008
Yes.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.376
But has Scott done it yet?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.933
Will he be coming for you?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.635
Someone's coming.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.073
But it's not Scott.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.267
We're never going
to get through.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.915
You've gotten through it
before, though, right?

36:47.939 --> 36:50.084
Ah, it was a life
and death situation.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.053
And this isn't?

36:52.077 --> 36:53.888
This isn't just a circle.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.912
There's Mountain Ash
in half the building.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.768
Stiles and Lydia had five
minutes to get in and out.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.992
It's been almost ten.
The reboot's over.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.573
And the key card
doesn't work anymore.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.542
And then there's
the four security guards.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.632
What guards?

37:16.101 --> 37:17.167
Those guards.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.756
I can't believe this is actually
a medical establishment.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.292
Now what would a pack of
Chimeras want with a Banshee?

37:31.316 --> 37:32.316
I don't want a Banshee.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.318
I'm looking for a Hellhound.
