DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:07.242
- What was the deal with you and Stefan?
- I was the first love of Stefan's life.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.606
Stefan, meet Julian.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.610
Julian was the man you were not
supposed to fall for.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.730
Does Stefan Salvatore know
that you are pregnant with his child?

00:18.400 --> 00:21.165
- What do you want, Enzo?
- I want you to tell me

00:21.400 --> 00:24.768
how we're going to prevent Julian
from walking back into Lily's life.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.765
- So, have you found Julian yet?
- I found him months ago.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.161
VALERIE: Julian is the devil.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.402
- I can't let Lily bring him back.

DAMON: Sure you wanna do this to Jo?

00:42.920 --> 00:46.003
RIC: If there is even 1% chance
that this could work, I need to take it.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.641
No matter how dangerous
or insane it may be.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.806
FEMALE DOCTOR #1: Bonnie?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.968
Is there something
you wanted to talk about?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.446
(SIGHS)

01:11.000 --> 01:12.650
I guess, um...

01:14.520 --> 01:18.969
I've been thinking a lot about
the past lately.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.681
And how one stupid decision can...

01:21.880 --> 01:22.961
(INHALES DEEPLY)

01:23.160 --> 01:25.561
Can turn your life into something
that you don't recognize.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.730
It belongs to someone else.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.011
I made a mistake.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.528
And I lost someone I loved.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.320
And I'd do anything
to take it back but I can't.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.044
All I can do is...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.526
Try and find a way to live with it.

Thank you, Bonnie.

Alex? ls there something
you like to share with the group?

02:18.080 --> 02:19.730
What are you doing here?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.726
(SIGHS) Things are bad out there, love.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.886

02:50.480 --> 02:51.561
(SIGHS)

02:51.760 --> 02:53.762
- How's she doing?
- I don't know.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.649
She's been sleeping for 12 hours.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.281
That's normal, right?

02:57.480 --> 03:00.802
Yesterday she was dead, today she's alive.
I'm not sure normal applies.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.246
- Please tell me that's food.
- Term papers.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.090
They were jamming up your inbox.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.487
You are still employed
as a professor here.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.291
Hey. Do you want a job as my new TA?

03:11.480 --> 03:14.086
All you have to do is write
"Interesting point" in a few margins

03:14.280 --> 03:17.727
-and then give everyone a B-plus.
- Tempting.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.162
But I need to figure out exactly
how I brought your wife

03:20.400 --> 03:23.961
-back to the land of the living.
- Look, she's here. She's okay.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.482
- What does it matter now?
- Because in less than 24 hours,

03:26.760 --> 03:28.967
I raised two people from the dead
with a sketchy spell

03:29.160 --> 03:30.969
and something called a Phoenix Stone.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.090
No research, no rehearsal time
and no contingency plan.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.442
And now
that I have a little breathing room,

03:37.080 --> 03:39.321
I wanna figure out what kind of magic
I was dealing with.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.087
Just in case I opened up Pandora's rock.
So can I have it back, please?

04:05.160 --> 04:07.322

Hey, sweetheart. How you feeling?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.800
I'm starving.

(CHUCKLES)

04:30.040 --> 04:32.407
This is torture for you, isn't it?

04:33.880 --> 04:35.211
No.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.048
No, I'm so happy
just lying here and doing nothing.

(STEFAN CHUCKLES)

04:42.120 --> 04:44.726

04:44.920 --> 04:46.206
-(CHUCKLES)
- Mmm-hmm.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.611
You're just making a mental checklist
of all the things you need to do today?

04:52.600 --> 04:56.241
Debating whether you should
accidentally kick me awake.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.051
Wait, did you say kick?
Or did you say kiss?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.486
(CHUCKLES)

05:00.720 --> 05:02.563
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.250
Good morning, lovebirds.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.561
Are you kidding me?

05:08.760 --> 05:10.569
I brought you some free-range,
overpriced coffee.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.762
One cream, two sugars,
just like you like it.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.166
(SIGHS) Actually,
I hate sugar in my coffee.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.569
Is there any particular reason
as to why you are

05:18.720 --> 05:21.803
barging into my girlfriend's dorm room
at the crack of mid-morning?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.844
Why such a Grumpy Gus?

05:24.280 --> 05:25.770
I thought you'd want to celebrate today.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.410
I finally got Elena tucked away safely.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.649
You're snuggled with Caroline
in this tragically tiny bed,

05:30.960 --> 05:33.440
and Ric,
Ric saved his lady from the great beyond.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.331
Everything is coming up Salvatore,

05:36.640 --> 05:40.440
so much so, that I have decided to
turn over a new leaf.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.011
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.483
I am gonna be the man that does right
by Elena. All on my own.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.446
By keeping her in my heart,
instead of keeping her underfoot.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.130
- That's interesting.
- I'm gonna need a little help

05:50.320 --> 05:52.004
with the dirty work,
so rise and shine, brother.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.601
We are going to interrogate
a tall, beautiful heretic

05:54.800 --> 05:56.165
with a terrible attitude.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.126
Valerie?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.131
Rings a bell.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.131
DAMON: Hmm.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.441
I'm missing something here.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.291
Oh, Stefan and Valerie
are old flames from way back.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.641
And they haven't had a face-to-face

06:07.880 --> 06:09.848
since she came
tumbling out of that prison world.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.686
Hang on. Valerie? As in v-card Valerie?

06:15.880 --> 06:18.281
Wham! Bam! Thank you, ma'am.
Broke your heart and...

06:18.520 --> 06:19.806
Uh...

06:21.320 --> 06:23.368
You know, I think this would be
the perfect opportunity

06:23.560 --> 06:25.005
for you two to catch up.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.404
Unless, there's a reason
it would be uncomfortable for you?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.961
- No.
- Great.

LILY: Good morning, Oscar.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.609
It was kind of you
to sit with him all night.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.047
Had a few bad nights myself
over the years.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.328
Right here, please, Lucy. Thank you.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.164
Oh, what's the occasion?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.490
My mother always used to keep
fresh flowers when expecting guests.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.001
I suppose I picked it up from her.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.249
- Ah. Julian, I presume.
- Yes.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.842
Yes, he'll arrive home today,
if all goes as planned.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.724
This is a good thing, Lorenzo.
I hope you can be happy for me.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.808
There's no reason the two of you
shouldn't get along.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.203
Yeah. Thick as thieves, I reckon.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.927
MARY: I want to drive,
but Beau won't give me the keys.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.528
Well, that's because you keep
hitting cats and utility poles.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.205
He's still sitting there?

07:37.480 --> 07:38.720
Oscar.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.527
Darling, it's Nora. Do you remember me?

07:42.080 --> 07:45.880
I don't like this. Oscar's meant to be
laughing and making jokes.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.849
Guess what, Oscar? Julian's coming back.
Life's about to get fun again.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.883
So fun.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.567
Right.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.603
Well, he's clearly unwell
and we can't just leave him here.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.523
Lorenzo, you wouldn't mind keeping an eye
on him, would you? We won't be long.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.563
- Happy to help.
- LILY: Thank you.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.371
And if you hear from Valerie,
please tell her to come home immediately.

08:07.560 --> 08:11.042
I know I was stern yesterday, but that's
no reason to sulk. Come on, girls.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.371
-(TIRES SCREECH)
- ENZO: Where are you?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.602
I'm headed out
to find Julian and I'm trying

08:18.760 --> 08:21.240
to follow the directions
on Oscar's stupid phone.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.605
And why doesn't anyone use real maps
anymore? What's wrong with paper?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.091
Well, I suggest you get a move on

08:26.280 --> 08:28.089
because Lily and company
are right behind you.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.802
What? That's impossible.
You promised to keep Oscar quiet.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.087
Oh, Oscar. He doesn't remember squat.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.164
They must have tracked Julian down on
their own with a locator spell

08:37.400 --> 08:38.970
or some other heretic malarkey.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.482
Never underestimate Lily's relentless
devotion to getting what she wants.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.130
Wait, what does it mean
when the little bar thing goes all red?

08:46.320 --> 08:48.288

- DAMON: That's a hefty fine, young lady.
- How did you--

08:57.000 --> 09:00.288
A little birdbrain said you stole his car
and sped out of Mystic Falls.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.650
You did realize that by taking
a deputy's SUV,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.241
that every move you made
would be tracked, right?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.642
Would you kindly move your car?

09:10.640 --> 09:13.530
That car? You bet I'll move that car.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.970
But first, I need to ask you why you
killed your faux-brother Oscar

09:17.160 --> 09:18.366
and framed me for the murder?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.762
(SCOFFS) I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.961
You're right.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.521
I might not be 100% on my detective work.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.762
It's possible that another heretic
turned him into a desiccated corpse.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.004
I'm not sure. So I'm gonna go to my car
and get my phone.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.969
I'm gonna call Lily, see if she knows.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.486
- Fine. You're a genius.
-(GRUNTS AND CHOKES)

I wouldn't do the same to you?

09:41.480 --> 09:44.689
- Hey, we're just talking here.
- STEFAN: Valerie.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.126
(GASPING)

09:47.680 --> 09:48.841
Stefan?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.850
Quit torturing my brother and tell me
exactly what's going on here.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.803
Is it safe to enter? Or is your boyfriend
still half-naked under the sheets?

10:08.680 --> 10:11.923
- God, I'm a roommate horror story.
- Please.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.891
At least your bed has seen a half-naked
male all semester.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.881
I think Miss Cuddles
is starting to feel sorry for me.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.883
I mean, look at her,
you see how she's judging me?

10:20.040 --> 10:21.326
(CHUCKLES)

10:21.720 --> 10:23.927
- I need man help.
-(CAROLINE LAUGHS)

10:24.240 --> 10:25.730
Well, don't look at me for advice.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.724
I just sent my boyfriend
to spend the day with his first love.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.406
Valerie?

10:30.600 --> 10:33.729
The heretic who turned your skin to
vervain, so you and Stefan couldn't touch?

10:33.920 --> 10:35.922
- Yeah, that would be the one.
- Wow.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.364
You are either completely insane
or the most secure woman in the world.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.404
(CHUCKLES) I want him
to work things out with her.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.570
He has this habit of bottling up
all of his hurt feelings,

10:45.760 --> 10:48.570
and I think it would be really good for
them if they could just...

10:48.760 --> 10:50.728
Clear away all the 19th-century drama,

10:50.920 --> 10:53.127
so they can get on with their lives.
Clean slate.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.769
Most secure woman it is.
I'm officially inspired.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.291
So you're going out to meet a guy?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.802
No. I'm going to Mystic Falls
to discuss magic with a heretic

11:03.040 --> 11:04.246
I just brought back to life.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.249
And then maybe, I'll go meet a guy.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.765
(CHUCKLES)

11:18.320 --> 11:19.606
Okay, I think I got it.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.922
You killed Oscar because he knew
how to get to Julian,

11:22.080 --> 11:25.289
but you hate Julian because
he's a sadistic, depraved, no-good monster

11:25.480 --> 11:27.960
that Lily desperately wants to bring home.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.929
Did you ever hear
of the Black Sea Massacre, 1897?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.283
Julian annihilated an entire coastline
on Christmas day,

11:35.960 --> 11:38.804
and yet, Lily is still hopelessly
in love with him.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.164
So? Stefan took out an entire village in
Monterey and Caroline still wants him.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.846
To each his own. Speaking of which,

11:46.320 --> 11:49.005
how did you two, um, meet?

11:49.240 --> 11:51.641
- At the town fair.
- Oh, right. That's right.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.842
And then you were supposed to meet
after that, right?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.801
Like, under a bridge? Or a tree?
Or a romantic park bench?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.128
Please just shut up.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.489
You know, when you didn't show,
this guy wrote 1 O pages in his journal

12:03.680 --> 12:05.648
about how the sun
would never shine as bright,

12:05.840 --> 12:08.491
and the food would never taste as sweet.
Yes, I read them.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.524
Your hiding places were always crap.
You really crushed the guy.

12:11.760 --> 12:17.051
Well, she was just spying for Lily.
I mean, it was all just a game, wasn't it?

12:19.520 --> 12:20.851
Ouch.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.810
But, yeah, no, hey, keep going, man.
This bit is, uh, absolutely hilarious.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.209
No, please, just stop. The only thing that
matters now is that we find Julian

12:29.440 --> 12:30.680
and make sure he can't come home.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.162
So, if you're not in,
spare me the car ride and let me out.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.530
No. Stefan's in. He's in. I'll watch.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.004
He's turning over a new leaf.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.409
Is that art or something?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.208
No. Actually, that's a TV.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.571
That's a TV. I'm Jo. You're Alaric,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.366
but you go by Ric

13:03.640 --> 13:05.051
-because it's an odd name.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:05.240 --> 13:07.083
And, we're married.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.205
Let's not worry about the details,
right now.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.244
It's gonna take a little time for your
memories to come back.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.045
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:14.360 --> 13:15.600
This is amazing.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.411
Did you make it?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.201
No, it's, uh, delivery.
(CHUCKLES)

13:21.440 --> 13:23.283
It's made somewhere else
and then someone drives it over.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.685
It's Thai food. Your favorite.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.525
Except for that. That's meat.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.409
- You don't eat meat.
- Why would I not eat meat?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.130
I have no idea. (CHUCKLES)

13:36.280 --> 13:38.248
(CHUCKLES) Hey, look,
let's open this bottle of wine.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.085
It's gotta be 5:00
in the afternoon somewhere, right?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.406
-(BOTTLE POPS)
- Oh!

13:43.760 --> 13:45.285
(RIC WINCES)

13:46.960 --> 13:50.806
It's not serious. Do you have bandages?
I'll wrap it for you.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.609
Medicine cabinet. Above the sink.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.131
Be right back.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.800
One make-up exam down, two more to go.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.761
Remind me never to be taken hostage at the
beginning of the semester ever again.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.251
CAROLINE: Where are you?

14:14.440 --> 14:16.602
Some gas station in the middle of nowhere.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.165
Don't worry, Care bear.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.443
I have issued a no-hanky-panky zone.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.327
No former flames will reignite
on my watch. Mmm-mmm. No how.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.803
Sorry about that.
The fumes are, uh, getting to his brain.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.005
Hey, listen, uh,
I want to take you to dinner tonight.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.446
Like a date?

14:32.640 --> 14:35.689
Wait, is this because you're feeling
guilty for spending the day with your ex?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.765
No, it's because I realized I haven't
actually taken you out yet.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.485
Well, I'd love that.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.530
To be honest, I'm feeling a little bit
guilty for pushing you into a car

14:43.760 --> 14:47.606
with your brother and your ex,
whom you clearly want nothing to do with.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.849
No, no. Don't feel guilty.
I needed a push.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.924
Why? Wait, did she make a move on you?

14:53.160 --> 14:56.209
Nothing happened. I just needed to hear
that our time together was a lie.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.206
She admitted that?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.171
She didn't deny it.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.840
Are you okay, or whatever?

15:04.280 --> 15:07.602
I will be once you tell me
what time I'm picking you up tonight.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.329
(CHUCKLES) Eight.
And I like daisies, by the way.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.330
Just in case you want to give me flowers.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.171
I'll see you tonight.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.651
(PHONE BEEPS)

15:18.000 --> 15:19.286
Fill this up.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.408
There's enough gas in the tank,
sassy pants.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.042
I need an accelerant to burn Julian's
body. I don't want to take any chances.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.681
Aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.848
We haven't even killed the guy yet.
(CHUCKLES)

15:30.520 --> 15:32.363
Are you really that daft?

15:33.320 --> 15:36.164
- We don't need to kill him.
- What, you're gonna charm him to death?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.850
-(CHUCKLES)
- Julian's dead.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.686
He's been dead since 1903.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.764
I'm afraid this house no longer has an
open-door policy for the local riffraff.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.850
You're living here, aren't you?

15:58.080 --> 16:00.321
Shall we spend a few moments
catching up before I throw you out?

16:00.560 --> 16:03.723
How was your summer holiday?
Meet any charming euro-hunks?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.202
God, please tell me you didn't
just follow Damon around

16:06.440 --> 16:07.885
-with spare bottles of Bourbon.
- I didn't.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.208
But it's sweet of you
to be concerned about my love life.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.086
I do admire your nerve, sticking around.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.886
And myself, I'd be flat-hunting on the
other side of the planet

16:17.120 --> 16:19.566
if I were the only thing
standing between Damon Salvatore

16:19.720 --> 16:22.371
and his everlasting happiness with Elena.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.562
Maybe the danger gives you a thrill.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.045
- Could it be a case of puppy love?
- See, now I think you're projecting.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.810
You're the one sleeping
at Lily Salvatore's feet,

16:31.040 --> 16:32.929
hoping for some of her good table scraps.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.569
- Good talk. Nice of you to stop by.
- Um, I need to talk to Oscar.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.445
- What about?
- Witch business. Super boring.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.405
Oh, I'm afraid Oscar is not feeling
quite like himself today.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.766
- So, maybe another time.
-(STUTTERING)

16:51.720 --> 16:52.926

16:53.240 --> 16:54.810
You're not supposed to eat the help, mate.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.646
A little blood, please?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.448
Clean yourself up and take a spa day.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.448
Forget all about Mr. Chompers
and his very bad manners.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.810
Hello, Oscar. Hey, do you remember me?
We met in Myrtle Beach?

17:12.960 --> 17:15.611
I've never been to Myrtle Beach.
But I do remember you.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.804
From that dark room in the basement.
Are you the one that got me out?

17:19.160 --> 17:20.650
Out of where?

17:22.280 --> 17:25.284
- I think I'm still hungry.
- Um, okay, just get a grip on yourself

17:25.520 --> 17:27.488
for five minutes
and we'll get you more blood.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.811
I came to ask you about the Phoenix Stone.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.686
What stone? Why do people keep asking me
questions I don't know the answers to?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.321
This stone. Know it?

17:41.680 --> 17:44.286
There. You got me out of there.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.891
Why would Oscar stash Julian's body
out here, in the middle of nowhere,

17:49.120 --> 17:50.849
when he can just hand it over to Lily?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.482
Because he knew the moment Lily gets
Julian back, the fun's over.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.007
- Everything changes.
- You killed him.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.684
- Makes a lot of sense.
- I told you, I have my reasons.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.887
(GRUNTS)

18:02.120 --> 18:03.360
You know, I was thinking,
it's probably a good thing

18:03.600 --> 18:04.726
that you and I cut things short.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.003
I mean, what if I accidentally
insulted your driving

18:08.160 --> 18:10.845
and you had no choice
but to run a butcher knife through me?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.525
VALERIE: Yeah,
it doesn't exactly sound like

18:12.680 --> 18:14.091
you've lived the life of a saint either.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.600
Surprise.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.251
The world changes people.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.885
And you must have figured that out by now.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.206
-(LOCK CLICKS)
-(DAMON GRUNTS)

18:20.360 --> 18:25.287
Hey, lovebirds. Quit your bickering.
Let's get this campfire started.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.364
(LIGHTS CLICK ON)

18:34.680 --> 18:37.968
Oh. A casket emporium. Clever.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.043
Oscar and his stupid pranks.

18:41.200 --> 18:45.569
So, Lily's still carrying a torch
for some moldy old corpse, hmm?

18:45.800 --> 18:49.486
Lily is determined to reunite Julian's
body with his lost soul.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.724
But, in order to do that,
she needs the Phoenix Stone.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.407
Phoenix Stone, huh? Never heard of it.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.291
Really? That's funny
since you clearly used it on Oscar.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.811
Who said we used it on Oscar?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.247
Oscar was dead and you needed
something to trade

19:02.400 --> 19:03.561
for your girlfriend in the box.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.564
So you tinkered around with it
and found a temporary solution.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.643
But, hey, good on you.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.565
Whoever you brought back
seemed to pull the wool over Lily's eyes.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.405
Wait. What do you mean,
"Whoever" we brought back?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.008
The Phoenix Stone is stuffed full of
very old vampire souls.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.561
You didn't raise
Oscar from the dead, you clods.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.161
You jammed
one of those souls into his body.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.447
How's everything with Professor
Frankenstein and his rebooted bride?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.080
Good, I think.
She was still asleep when I left.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.089
Oh. Good. Glad to hear it.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.609
So, quick favor. I'm gonna need you to
tell Ric that we made a...

19:46.520 --> 19:48.488
Tiny mistake and that that's not his wife.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.604
- What?
- Yeah, it turns out that the stone

19:50.760 --> 19:53.604
doesn't actually have any magic juice to
bring back any old corpse.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.810
It's more like a supernatural holding cell
for a bunch of lost vampire souls,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.810
one of which you accidentally
shoved into Jo's body.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.964
- Oh, my God. That means Oscar's--
- Not Oscar.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.441
He's just some random vampire
in a heretic candy shell.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.120
Damon, I came to your house
to talk to him about the stone.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.807
Bad idea. Cut the conversation short.
Call Ric from the car on the way home.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.002
- Oh, no, don't put this on me.
- Well, I'm sorry,

20:15.200 --> 20:18.010
I'm trying to do this thing where I do
right by Elena

20:18.200 --> 20:22.125
I just don't think that she'd want me to
crush his spirit like that.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.171
Let him down gently.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.481
Is this you doing right by Elena

20:25.680 --> 20:27.489
or you not wanting to
break your best friend's heart?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.328
(INHALES DEEPLY) Fine. But you owe me.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.005
Thanks, Bon Bon.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.247
I found Oscar a few blood bags
stashed in the study.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.006
Probably expired,
but he does not seem picky.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.560
I have to head back to Whitmore.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.322
I meant to ask you
about this pretty stone.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.766
Where'd you find it?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.685
Rocks R Us. It was on sale.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.851
That's funny.
Lily's been looking for one just like it.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.003
Well, bargain bin was full of them,
I'm sure they have more.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.680
Or I could just take this one.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.080
I don't think so.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.446
I'm not going back in there.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.921
(SNARLS)

21:04.200 --> 21:05.440
Aah! (GRUNTS)

21:06.200 --> 21:07.440
I'm not going back.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.211
What the hell is he talking about?

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
Let's just say you were right.
Oscar's not himself today.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.682
Why does everyone keep calling me Oscar?

21:18.880 --> 21:21.042
My name's not Oscar!

21:24.760 --> 21:26.888
Did I do that? (PANTING)

21:31.920 --> 21:33.206
Run.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.721
Hey, you want to get some fresh air?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.241
You know, maybe a walk
through campus will stir something.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.606
What are you doing?

21:49.440 --> 21:50.885
What happened to me?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.129
This was mine, wasn't it?

22:00.560 --> 22:02.130
Yeah, that's your wedding dress.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.362
RIC: The hospital asked me
if I wanted to save it.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.371
What happened to me?

22:09.080 --> 22:10.366
(SIGHS)

22:12.240 --> 22:15.244
Your brother had
a lifelong vendetta against you.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.402
He stabbed you and I couldn't
get you to the hospital in time.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.601
So what happened?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.450
I'm gonna explain everything
when you're feeling better.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.931
It's gonna make a lot more sense--

22:24.080 --> 22:25.764
Why wouldn't it make sense now?

22:25.960 --> 22:27.450
Because it is crazy, Jo.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.647
It is the craziest thing

22:28.880 --> 22:32.441
either of us have ever been through
and that is saying something.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.410
I remember. I was stabbed.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.007
(SHUDDERS) I was stabbed in the heart.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.005
No, no. Not in the heart.
He came at you from behind.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.083
And I didn't see him
until it was too late.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.443
No. I was stabbed in the heart.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.483
Jo. Calm down. Everything's gonna be--

22:49.760 --> 22:52.445
No. Don't touch me. Stay away from me.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.171
You know, we got Nora to siphon
that repulsion spell you put on Caroline,

23:07.440 --> 23:09.090
just in case you were wondering.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.209
Oh. I'd forgotten all about that.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.601
Why'd you do it?

23:12.800 --> 23:14.802
I mean, you couldn't have been worried
about Caroline's safety.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.810
What do you want me to say?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.171
Because I'm pure evil?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.002
Because I like seeing people suffer?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.847
Well, if that's the truth then, yeah.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.120
I'm not a horrible person.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.481
Really? Well, then who are you?

23:28.640 --> 23:31.166
I mean, you turn

(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

36:55.640 --> 36:58.405
Well, can you give me
an overview of the options?

36:59.480 --> 37:00.970
I'm angry that I didn't know.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.169
I'm sad that something I could have had
was taken away from me.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.521
I want to kill Julian
for what he did to you.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.487
And I'm sorry that you had to
go through this alone.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.531
After it happened, I wanted to die.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.640
I did die.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.845
I took my own life.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.004
I obviously didn't realize
I had vampire blood in my system.

37:32.400 --> 37:36.724
That's how you became a vampire?
You killed yourself?

37:39.360 --> 37:41.840
Far cry from that girl
you met at the fair, isn't it?

37:45.280 --> 37:49.001
It's funny how one event can change
the outcome of your entire life.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.210
Please don't tell anyone.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.531
I couldn't bare for Lily to know.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.047
I won't. I promise.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.682
Look, I don't presume to know you now

38:01.880 --> 38:04.121
or even what you wanted back then, but--

38:04.360 --> 38:05.566
Yes.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.649
Would I have wanted a child?

38:08.880 --> 38:10.370
(STEFAN INHALES DEEPLY)

38:11.640 --> 38:12.880
Yes.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.724
Look, we have, um, five guest rooms.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.804
You should probably stay the night.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.442
No. I should run.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.724
As far and fast as I can.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.884
Damon won't let Lily
get her hands on that stone.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.564
And if she does,
I will kill Julian myself.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.606
(MARY AND NORA CHANTING)

38:50.240 --> 38:53.130
BONNIE: So Lily is the reason
I'll never see Elena again.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.931
Apparently, she has a thing
for emotional torture.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.769
I guess the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.241
Hey, I do not go behind people's backs
and torture them.

39:01.960 --> 39:05.931
I like my enemies to look me in the eye
and see the depth of my rage. (CHUCKLES)

39:06.640 --> 39:07.926
You're sure you want to do this?

39:08.280 --> 39:10.760
Burning that bastard's body
would have been too good for Lily.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.729
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

39:23.160 --> 39:26.084
I want to give her that man
that she's cherished and loved,

39:26.280 --> 39:28.123
and missed for 100 years.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.844
I want her to run into Julian's arms,

39:35.080 --> 39:36.605
and I want her to remember
what it feels like

39:36.800 --> 39:38.086
to have that love returned.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.601
I want her to taste true happiness.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.131
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

39:43.240 --> 39:44.480
(GLASS SHATTERS)

39:50.520 --> 39:51.806
(GLASS SHATTERS)

39:59.840 --> 40:01.171
(GRUNTS)

40:01.480 --> 40:04.643
(QUAVERING) Julian? Is that you?

40:06.480 --> 40:08.801
Lily? My...

40:09.000 --> 40:10.490
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

40:13.000 --> 40:15.321
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:17.160 --> 40:20.528
And then, I want to rip
his head off right in front of her.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.171
I want to break her heart.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.730
I want to break her spirit.
I want to destroy her.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.122
So much for the new leaf, huh?

40:30.560 --> 40:32.324
Tell me I'm being
stupid and reckless and cruel.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.488
Tell me I'm not doing right by Elena.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.005
You're doing right by Elena.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.888
Well, glad to see you boarded this train
to crazy town, Bonnie Bennett.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.842
I was getting lonely all by myself.
