WEBVTT

00:03.713 --> 00:05.704
( pulsating )

00:13.264 --> 00:15.926
( labored breathing )

00:21.814 --> 00:23.315
(thuds)

00:25.651 --> 00:29.610
I have to say
I was impressed.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.863
You had taken a risk.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.320
Getting your hands dirty.

00:38.623 --> 00:41.956
You know, we were
gonna have those biters

00:42.126 --> 00:45.038
for our little
Michonne and--

00:45.213 --> 00:50.003
Milton: You were gonna use them
on whoever showed up.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.712
That's right.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.719
Hey, hey.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.255
Because we didn't
have them,

00:57.433 --> 01:00.516
you burned them up,

01:00.686 --> 01:03.063
eight of my men died.

01:09.946 --> 01:12.983
Now, you knew
those men. Huh?

01:13.157 --> 01:17.776
They kept you safe,
kept you fed.

01:17.954 --> 01:21.446
As long as I looked
the other way.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.455
Yeah.

01:23.626 --> 01:26.618
Well, it can't be
like that anymore.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.501
Time for you to graduate.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.098
Hey.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.980
I'm gonna tell you
the secret.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.432
There's a threat,
you end it.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.647
And you don't feel ashamed
about enjoying it.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.701
You smell the gunpowder
and you see the blood--

01:57.868 --> 01:59.824
you know what that means?

02:02.498 --> 02:04.830
It means you're alive.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.827
You've won.

02:10.006 --> 02:13.339
You take the heads
so that you don't ever forget.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.585
You kill or you die.

02:23.352 --> 02:26.515
What would
your daughter think

02:26.689 --> 02:28.395
about what you are?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.602
She'd be afraid of me.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.520
But ifl had been
like this from the start,

02:36.699 --> 02:38.860
she'd be alive today.

02:49.712 --> 02:53.455
Did you kill Andrea?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.623
(Andrea gasping )

02:55.801 --> 02:57.507
Milton.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.465
Governor:
See? She's still alive.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.051
I'm gonna need her
for something.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.965
Andrea: I heard you
in the other room.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.977
You don't have to lose
any more of your men.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.637
Just stop this.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.516
Your friends
at the prison--

03:13.694 --> 03:16.401
I'm gonna kill them all.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.904
People are gonna help me.

03:19.075 --> 03:22.738
I had to stretch the truth
a little bit, butjust a little.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.412
Now they're foaming
at the mouth.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.541
You, get those tools.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.451
I'm not gonna
need them anymore.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.120
Go on.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.260
Careful.
Pick that up.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.399
Come on! Step to.
Let's go.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.191
Hold up.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.953
I'll take that.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.614
Put 'em down.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.291
( panting )

04:19.593 --> 04:21.845
You're gonna
kill her now.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.093
You're gonna show me
that you've learned something.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.098
Milton...

04:32.273 --> 04:35.686
there is no way
you are leaving this room

04:35.860 --> 04:37.316
without doing it.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.569
So don't make it hard.
Just--

04:41.991 --> 04:43.777
just do it.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.487
That's it.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.922
- ( grunts)
-(gaspS)

05:05.097 --> 05:07.088
( groans )

05:10.311 --> 05:12.267
( piercing )

05:12.438 --> 05:15.521
(gasping )

05:17.276 --> 05:19.688
I told you
you were gonna do it.

05:22.865 --> 05:26.107
And now you're gonna die.

05:26.285 --> 05:29.402
And you're gonna turn.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.913
And you're gonna tear
the flesh from her bones.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.002
In this life now,

05:43.177 --> 05:45.589
you kill or you die.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.015
Or you die and you kill.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.683
(theme music playing )

07:48.927 --> 07:50.667
Carl.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.900
I've never seen him
this mad.

08:11.075 --> 08:14.363
Even with Lori.
He just shut down.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.950
He's still a kid.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.410
It's easy to forget.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.936
You know, Merle never did
nothing like that his whole life.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.647
He gave us a chance.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.584
We're ready.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.383
The deal the Governor
offered about me--

09:17.558 --> 09:19.924
you had to think
about it.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.014
You had to.
| get it.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.348
Yeah.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.438
I'm sorry.
I came real close.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.477
But you didn't.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.279
I never thanked you.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.948
For what?

09:44.126 --> 09:47.664
For getting me
out there that day,

09:47.838 --> 09:49.578
taking me in.

09:51.967 --> 09:55.585
Well, if you didn't have
that baby formula,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.628
I wouldn't have.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.218
You could have
just taken the formula.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.769
Well...

10:02.936 --> 10:05.188
must have been
something else, then.

10:07.524 --> 10:11.813
You know, it was Carl
who made the call.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.603
He said you belonged here.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.114
You're one of us.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.410
Remember, they killed
eight men back there.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.328
- ( guns clicking)
- Five here last time.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.873
They're no different
from the biters.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.542
They're not gonna stop
until they kill us all,

10:36.720 --> 10:39.553
taken everything
we've worked so hard for.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.009
We're gonna end this
once and for all.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.674
Governor.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.018
This ain't easy to say.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.180
You're gonna have
to count us out.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.520
Sasha:
This isn't our fight.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.480
Tyreese: We'll fight
against the biters,

10:54.655 --> 10:56.646
not other people.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.156
Now we'll stay here
and defend the children.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.363
When you return,
if you want us gone,

11:02.538 --> 11:04.745
no hard feelings.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.552
Thank you.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.943
(engines start)

11:38.407 --> 11:40.898
Let's roll!

11:41.076 --> 11:44.068
(snarling )

12:19.698 --> 12:20.858
(pop5)

12:52.814 --> 12:54.475
Go!

13:10.374 --> 13:12.160
Governor:
Go, go! Move!

13:12.334 --> 13:14.495
Martinez: Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.351
Come on, come on.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.764
( can clanking )

15:38.647 --> 15:40.433
Give me a flashlight.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.565
Let's split up.
You take a group that way.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.568
You, bring a group,
follow me.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.982
(door creaking )

16:00.669 --> 16:02.330
Go.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.344
- Andrea: Milton?
- When the tools dropped,

16:12.514 --> 16:15.722
l-l left some pliers

16:15.892 --> 16:18.975
on the floor behind you.

16:20.272 --> 16:23.514
If you can drag--
( pants )

16:23.692 --> 16:27.685
if you can drag your right foot back,
you-- you can get them.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.454
That-- that's it.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.212
- Oh, God.
- Almost.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.543
I'm gonna get us both
out of here.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.879
And you're gonna be okay.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.544
Now when--
when you get free,

16:54.723 --> 16:58.215
you are going to find
something very sharp...

16:59.853 --> 17:03.186
and you are going
to stab me in the head.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.108
That is what
you are going to do.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.988
Keep trying.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.620
Come on.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.918
( door squeaks)

17:37.682 --> 17:39.968
Hey.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.054
Over there.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.186
- ( distant clang )
- What was that?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.980
- ( clatters)
- Shh.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.572
( distant clatter)

18:03.124 --> 18:04.910
This way.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.845
We took out a few biters
on the south wall.

18:23.019 --> 18:26.261
Other than that,
everything's quiet.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.179
I'll get the next one.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.733
What do you think happens
when they return?

18:32.904 --> 18:35.941
We might have to slip out.
Andrea made it out.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.449
If she's at the prison,
it didn't do her any good.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.359
I'll be right back.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.278
- It's my turn.
- Stay put.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.617
I got it.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.837
( door closes)

18:52.007 --> 18:54.339
I got it. I got it.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.753
Milton?

19:20.952 --> 19:24.240
( groans, gasps )

19:24.414 --> 19:26.996
(sighs)

19:27.167 --> 19:28.703
Milton.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.368
Why did you stay...

19:33.590 --> 19:37.333
after you found out
your friends were out there?

19:39.763 --> 19:42.129
I wanted to save everyone.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.558
Even the Governor
for a while.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.021
I had a chance to kill him.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.023
What stopped you?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.480
You know,
this was before.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.272
He was asleep.
I had a knife.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.408
But I tried to stop it all
another way...

20:08.416 --> 20:11.078
because I didn't want
anyone to die.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.098
I'm still here.

20:28.436 --> 20:32.270
I'm still alive.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.022
Yeah.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.605
You are.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.780
You need to hurry.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.784
Right.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.835
Okay.

21:05.974 --> 21:09.717
- ( explosion )
- ( all shouting)

21:09.894 --> 21:11.759
(alarm blaring )

21:11.938 --> 21:15.146
- Hold your ground!
- ( shouting continues)

21:15.316 --> 21:17.477
Hold your ground!

21:18.820 --> 21:20.936
(snarling )

21:21.114 --> 21:22.979
(gunfire)

21:24.701 --> 21:27.568
( people screaming )

21:33.668 --> 21:35.954
Get the hell out of here!

21:38.715 --> 21:40.671
( distant gunfire )

21:44.387 --> 21:46.093
I should be there.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.549
Go.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.511
- ( coughing)
- ( gunfire)

21:53.146 --> 21:55.512
- Move!
- Go. Go, go, go.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.607
Go.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.564
Move! Move!

22:08.995 --> 22:11.077
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

22:11.247 --> 22:12.578
- Allen: It's not working.
- Go, man!

22:12.749 --> 22:14.364
Shit.
lt's jammed!

22:14.542 --> 22:16.999
- Return--
- ( gunfire)

22:18.880 --> 22:19.915
Hey!

22:20.089 --> 22:22.250
They're not going anywhere.
Come on.

22:24.219 --> 22:27.552
( bullets ricocheting )

22:35.563 --> 22:37.303
We did it?

22:37.482 --> 22:38.938
We did it.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.439
Come on down.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't shoot.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.453
Drop the weapon, son.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.458
Sure.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.086
Here, take it.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.461
- ( gunshot)
- ( thuds)

23:21.442 --> 23:23.433
( all panting )

23:26.489 --> 23:28.946
We did it.
We drove them out.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.482
We should go after them.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.446
- We should finish it.
- Maggie: It is finished.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.951
Didn't you see them
hightail it out of here?

23:34.122 --> 23:35.783
- Michonne: They could regroup.
- We can't take the chance.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.322
- He's not gonna stop.
- They're right.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.615
We can't keep
living like this.

23:38.793 --> 23:39.828
So we take the fight
back to Woodbury.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.368
We barely made it back
last time.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.956
He don't care.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.042
Yeah.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.417
Let's check on the others.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.178
( door closes)

24:00.815 --> 24:03.932
(Judith coos)

24:04.110 --> 24:06.101
Hey.

24:11.159 --> 24:15.118
- Hey.
- Dad, I'm coming to Woodbury.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.779
- Carl.
- Dad, I did do my job out there.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.663
Just like all of you.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.335
Took out one
of the Governor's soldiers.

24:21.502 --> 24:24.118
Hershel:
One of his soldiers?

24:24.297 --> 24:26.834
A kid running away?
He stumbled across us.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.669
No, he drew on us.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.501
I'm sorry you had
to do that.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.795
It's what I was there for.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.964
I'm going with you.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.885
( door opens)

24:41.064 --> 24:43.976
That kid was scared.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.357
He was handing
his gun over.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.686
He said he drew.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.695
Carl said it was
in defense.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.155
l was there.
He didn't have to shoot.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.661
He had every reason
not to--

24:58.831 --> 25:00.116
Maybe it looked like
that to you, Hershel--

25:00.291 --> 25:01.701
Rick!

25:05.630 --> 25:07.712
I'm telling you

25:07.882 --> 25:10.464
he gunned that kid down.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.890
- ( tires squeal )
-( honking horn)

25:20.061 --> 25:21.847
Move over!

25:22.021 --> 25:24.854
Hey!
I want this truck over.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.015
Go.
Pull in front of them.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.690
(tires squeal )

25:33.658 --> 25:35.740
What the hell
are you doing?

25:35.910 --> 25:37.821
- We need to dig in.
- Paul: It's not worth it.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.860
- That was a slaughter.
- You bunch of pussies.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.540
I told you we should have
handled this shit ourselves.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.244
We're done fighting
for a hole with a half dozen

25:43.418 --> 25:45.079
psychopaths living in it.
They can keep it.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.244
Allen: You've seen what
they've done-- attacked us.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.037
They killed my boy.
We're going back.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.252
We are not soldiers.
Want us to kill biters, of course.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.917
- But this is crazy.
- Allen: Go home, then.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.301
You think you're
gonna be safe?

25:55.471 --> 25:56.551
Paul: I'm going back
to Woodbury.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.634
We're not here
to settle a grudge.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.890
(screaming )

26:02.812 --> 26:05.098
(gunfire)

26:34.010 --> 26:36.126
(bird cawing)

26:53.696 --> 26:56.028
(gasping quietly)

26:58.409 --> 27:00.695
(gunshot)

27:09.837 --> 27:13.250
(bird cawing)

27:18.596 --> 27:20.461
( exhales )

27:49.710 --> 27:51.291
( taps )

28:00.054 --> 28:02.045
( pliers scraping )

28:04.433 --> 28:06.685
Come on.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.184
Okay.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.891
Okay.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.936
Okay.
All right.

28:19.574 --> 28:22.236
You're still here.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.992
You're still alive.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.743
All right.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.884
Shit!

28:58.279 --> 28:59.815
All right.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.360
- All right. Okay.
- ( soft clang )

29:43.074 --> 29:44.814
Michonne.

29:57.505 --> 30:01.168
Hershel told me
about the boy you shot.

30:01.342 --> 30:04.084
He had a gun.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.252
Hmm.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.472
Was he handing it over?

30:12.395 --> 30:15.933
- He had just attacked us.
- Yeah.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.223
Yes, he had.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.527
Was he handing it over?

30:27.034 --> 30:30.026
I couldn't take the chance.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.910
I didn't kill the walker
that killed Dale.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.037
- Look what happened.
- Son, that is not the same thing.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.494
You didn't kill Andrew

30:36.669 --> 30:39.126
and he came back
and killed Mom.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.381
You were in a room
with the Governor

30:43.551 --> 30:45.792
and you let him go.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.382
And then he killed Merle.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.047
I did what I had to do.

30:53.978 --> 30:56.185
Now go.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.604
So he doesn't kill
any more of us.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.481
( metal clinks)

31:18.586 --> 31:21.703
Rick, we're staying.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.462
We don't know
where the Governor is.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.418
If he comes back,
we'll hold him off.

31:25.593 --> 31:28.426
Just the three of us?

31:28.596 --> 31:31.087
All right.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.096
I appreciate you staying.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.803
Sure.

31:52.286 --> 31:53.947
Come on, come on.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.136
(crunching)

32:21.315 --> 32:23.647
(snarling )

32:46.715 --> 32:48.626
( bangs)

32:48.801 --> 32:50.757
( hammer clicks)

33:15.953 --> 33:18.160
(snarling )

33:22.459 --> 33:23.915
Come on.
Come on.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.841
Okay, okay.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.854
Oh! Come on!

33:51.572 --> 33:54.188
(Andrea screaming )

33:54.366 --> 33:57.574
(Milton snarling)

33:57.745 --> 34:01.203
(thudding)

34:01.373 --> 34:04.706
( metal squeaking )

34:15.679 --> 34:17.715
(gunshot)

34:27.691 --> 34:29.022
Karen:
Ty reese!

34:29.193 --> 34:32.560
- It's me! Don't--
- Get down!

34:32.738 --> 34:34.069
Ty reese:
Karen!

34:34.240 --> 34:35.696
Karen, are you okay?

34:35.866 --> 34:38.858
- I'm fine!
- Where's the Governor?

34:39.036 --> 34:40.901
He fired on everyone.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.945
He killed them all.

34:49.129 --> 34:53.543
- Tyreese: Why are you with them?
- They saved me.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.094
We're coming out!

34:59.265 --> 35:01.005
No.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.971
We're coming out.

35:24.415 --> 35:27.407
Tyreese:
What are you doing here?

35:27.584 --> 35:30.166
We were coming
to finish this

35:30.337 --> 35:33.921
until we saw
what the Governor did.

35:34.091 --> 35:38.425
Tyreese:
He-- he killed them?

35:38.595 --> 35:41.678
Yeah.

35:41.849 --> 35:44.010
Karen told us
Andrea hopped the wall

35:44.184 --> 35:45.515
going for the prison.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.551
She never made it.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.430
She might be here.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.348
Rick: This is where he had
Glenn and Maggie.

35:53.527 --> 35:54.858
Tyreese: The Governor
held people here?

35:55.029 --> 35:56.860
Daryl: He did more
than hold them.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.961
Will you open it?

36:23.140 --> 36:25.176
One, two...

36:29.063 --> 36:30.894
Andrea!

36:38.489 --> 36:40.400
I tried to stop them.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.610
You're burning up.

36:52.503 --> 36:56.087
Judith, Carl,

36:56.256 --> 36:57.996
the rest of them...

36:58.175 --> 37:00.712
Us.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.502
The rest of us.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.307
Are they alive?

37:14.358 --> 37:17.475
Yeah, they're alive.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.902
It's good you found them.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.417
No one can
make it alone now.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.624
They never could.

37:43.429 --> 37:46.341
ljust didn't want
anyone to die.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.147
- I can do it myself.
- No.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.976
l have to.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.646
While I still can.

38:09.079 --> 38:11.035
Please?

38:17.087 --> 38:20.124
I know how
the safety works.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.474
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.422
I tried.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.168
Yeah.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.756
You did.

39:13.143 --> 39:14.758
You did.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.675
(gunshot)

41:05.213 --> 41:07.124
No, it's okay.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.669
What is this?

41:15.682 --> 41:17.513
They're gonnajoin us.

42:32.092 --> 42:34.583
(music playing )
