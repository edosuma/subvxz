I'm so sorry I killed you.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.644
But, to be clear,
you were being a bitch.

01:26.723 --> 01:28.712
I haven't been this scared
since that time we went

01:28.722 --> 01:30.215
to that haunted house on Cape Cod

01:30.225 --> 01:32.351
that had the mix-and-match china.

01:33.730 --> 01:36.221
Ooh, I shudder to this day.

01:36.231 --> 01:38.757
One time, a ghost
had sex with me in my sleep.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.393
He was really spooky,

01:40.403 --> 01:41.894
and he looked just like Frederick,

01:41.904 --> 01:44.230
and he smelled like Frederick,
and he was solid

01:44.240 --> 01:46.933
and really easy to touch,
and not translucent,

01:46.943 --> 01:48.435
but it wasn't a ghost.

01:48.445 --> 01:50.870
It was Frederick.

01:53.751 --> 01:55.610
Frederick, who do you think
the ghost is?

01:55.620 --> 01:57.311
Well, I don't want you
to panic, Lillian,

01:57.321 --> 01:59.280
but I think you're sitting
right next to her.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.053
That's not a ghost. That's our mother.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.059
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

02:10.068 --> 02:11.993
You are... right. Sorry, Mother,

02:12.003 --> 02:13.894
you just looked so pale and ghostly.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.164
Why thank you, darling.

02:15.174 --> 02:17.833
The only way to properly
dispose of a ghost

02:17.843 --> 02:20.001
is to ask it nicely to leave.

02:20.011 --> 02:22.939
I couldn't agree more, Mother.
That's why I've hired

02:22.949 --> 02:26.576
the hottest spiritualist
in town to host a séance for us!

02:27.820 --> 02:29.279
I heard the Herkimers

02:29.289 --> 02:31.012
only got four ghosts at their séance,

02:31.022 --> 02:32.481
and one was just a stillborn baby

02:32.491 --> 02:33.617
who couldn't even talk.

02:33.627 --> 02:35.913
I won't even get out of bed
for less than ten ghosts.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.755
I present Mr. Harry Houdini.

02:43.736 --> 02:45.664
I hear you have a spirit issue?

02:45.674 --> 02:47.965
Ooh.

02:47.975 --> 02:49.233
Yes.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.706
And then the ghost was gone.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.974
Right out of thin air!

02:55.984 --> 02:57.408
Are you sure it was real?

02:57.418 --> 03:00.011
It was a real ghost.

03:00.021 --> 03:01.335
My teats cried.

03:01.345 --> 03:03.148
Oh, my God, are you serious?

03:04.894 --> 03:08.588
You want to hear a story
about a real ghost, hmm?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.524
Well...

03:11.534 --> 03:16.162
The man who built this house
went insane.

03:16.172 --> 03:19.565
Slaughtered his wife and children.

03:19.575 --> 03:23.236
Chopped them up, ate gunpowder,
sliced his own manhood in two,

03:23.246 --> 03:26.474
and lit himself... aflame.

03:26.484 --> 03:28.843
I don't like aflame.

03:28.853 --> 03:31.144
At night, they say,

03:31.154 --> 03:36.017
he slides into servants
through their bad place.

03:36.027 --> 03:40.522
That's... their assholes.

03:40.532 --> 03:42.825
And do you want to know

03:42.835 --> 03:46.594
what the name of that maniac was?

03:46.604 --> 03:48.965
Ferwilliger Baccarat?

03:48.975 --> 03:51.134
- Tell us, tell us!
- I'll tell you.

03:53.413 --> 03:55.637
He doesn't have a name.

03:55.647 --> 03:56.873
You idiots.

03:56.883 --> 04:00.142
Because he doesn't exist.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.926
Just like ghosts don't exist.

04:02.936 --> 04:05.615
Hmm? You stupid shitheads.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.987
Well. Sticky Jonathan's real.

04:09.997 --> 04:12.523
- Who is that?
- Oh, Sticky Jonathan.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.860
Well, he gets hungry
if he doesn't get his macaroons.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.495
That's why he's so sticky.
That and the blood

04:17.505 --> 04:20.432
that covers his chest.
That's from his papa.

04:20.442 --> 04:24.502
Papa was angry.
He watches me while I sleep.

04:24.512 --> 04:25.936
He sleeps forever.

04:25.946 --> 04:27.807
You're always talking
about Sticky Jonathan.

04:27.817 --> 04:29.674
He's a figment of your imagination.

04:29.684 --> 04:31.044
Well, if he's a figment,

04:31.054 --> 04:33.912
then how come my stomach
was all sticky this morning?

04:33.922 --> 04:36.049
That's not... it's not...

04:37.121 --> 04:38.585
Quit this idle chitchat!

04:38.595 --> 04:42.223
We have a code white.
We need to eradicate the ghosts

04:42.233 --> 04:45.559
that Mr. Harry Houdini is trying
to bring into this plane

04:45.569 --> 04:47.561
with his foolish "say-on-say."

04:47.571 --> 04:50.263
Flobelle, paint the lamb's blood
above the kitchen door.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.831
Blanche, kill yourself

04:51.841 --> 04:55.660
so you can talk to the ghosts in their
native language. Garfield, come!

04:56.713 --> 04:58.739
That's what was on his stomach.

04:58.749 --> 05:00.708
You think so?

05:04.488 --> 05:07.350
Now, there are three séance packages

05:07.360 --> 05:09.417
to choose from. The basic,

05:09.427 --> 05:12.787
wherein I speak to the spirit
but you can't hear them;

05:12.797 --> 05:15.924
the deluxe, wherein
I channel the weakened spirit...

05:15.934 --> 05:17.326
you may speak to it,

05:17.336 --> 05:19.896
but it will only whine in response.

05:19.906 --> 05:21.902
Sounds like the Jewish package.

05:24.144 --> 05:27.603
They're all Jewish packages.

05:27.613 --> 05:31.843
And finally,
the best value, best option,

05:31.853 --> 05:35.446
top-of-the-line
Champagne Excelsior package,

05:35.456 --> 05:37.782
where I channel your loved one...

05:37.792 --> 05:41.251
fully nude, anything goes.

05:41.261 --> 05:42.955
We'll take the Excelsior.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.723
We always choose
the most expensive option.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.525
- Mm, okay.
- Yes, that's why I sleep

05:46.535 --> 05:49.160
on a mattress made of one entire ruby.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.595
It's not comfortable at all,
but it's very expensive.

05:51.605 --> 05:54.566
Wonderful. Now, let me ask you...

05:54.576 --> 05:57.670
what do you think is haunting you?

05:57.680 --> 05:59.271
I'm sensing...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.040
a P...

06:01.050 --> 06:03.143
- I (bleep) my brother!
- Ooh, me too.

06:03.153 --> 06:04.511
Except, you know, switched.

06:04.521 --> 06:07.480
I once pushed a blind priest
off of a cliff.

06:07.490 --> 06:09.516
I know it doesn't sound like it,
but trust me,

06:09.526 --> 06:11.518
it was hilarious.

06:11.528 --> 06:14.554
Okay... okay. Ah...

06:14.564 --> 06:17.792
but literal hauntings. Any ghosts?

06:17.802 --> 06:20.328
Oh, oh, I know who the ghost is.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.264
- It's Mayor Cutie.
- Oh, a dignitary.

06:23.274 --> 06:26.367
They go at a slightly higher rate.

06:26.377 --> 06:28.869
I will charge you...

06:28.879 --> 06:31.540
double?

06:31.550 --> 06:34.244
Oh, delightful. We would've paid triple.

06:56.043 --> 06:59.338
Oh, hey... Hey there, Mister, uh...

06:59.348 --> 07:02.040
Mr. Houdini, is it?
I knew you did magic.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.343
I... big fan, by the way, but...

07:04.353 --> 07:06.068
I didn't realize you did conjurings too.

07:06.079 --> 07:08.112
Yes, well, today,
everyone in entertainment

07:08.122 --> 07:10.114
has to diversify. I'm a triple threat:

07:10.124 --> 07:11.516
magician, conjurer,

07:11.526 --> 07:13.866
director of the New Jersey
Department of Public Works.

07:13.877 --> 07:15.287
I do magic too, actually.

07:15.297 --> 07:16.554
That's fascinating.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.792
I've been doing it
for about eight years now.

07:19.802 --> 07:21.863
I, uh... I mean, more seriously now

07:21.874 --> 07:23.540
for... I, well...
I've never been onstage.

07:23.551 --> 07:26.299
I would be so honored
if I could show you

07:26.309 --> 07:28.035
some of my stuff.

07:28.045 --> 07:30.737
I don't work with amateurs.

07:30.747 --> 07:32.439
Do you even have a lovely assistant?

07:32.449 --> 07:34.239
- Lovely...?
- Assistant?

07:34.249 --> 07:36.376
A confection for the eyes?

07:36.386 --> 07:38.578
It's standard for a guy at your level...

07:38.588 --> 07:40.715
the bottom.
Like a... maybe some kind of.

07:40.725 --> 07:43.049
Slovenian arm-wrestler, right?

07:43.059 --> 07:44.751
With a big wooly beard,

07:44.761 --> 07:46.920
and forearms like Christmas hams.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.489
What? No, a lady.

07:48.499 --> 07:50.958
It's got to be a lady. You know,

07:50.968 --> 07:54.463
the kind you can saw in half
and bang either half afterward.

07:54.473 --> 07:55.965
It's all the same to me.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.133
Of course. I enjoy ladies.

07:58.143 --> 07:59.934
- Okay.
- Their long, funny necks

07:59.944 --> 08:01.369
and jagged shoulders.

08:01.379 --> 08:03.439
I'm gonna find myself an assistant.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.773
You can bet on it.

08:04.783 --> 08:06.309
Who knows?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.410
Maybe you can open up
for me someday, kid.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.086
There we are...

08:17.264 --> 08:19.657
The spirit world and the earthly plane

08:19.667 --> 08:21.259
should never meet.

08:21.269 --> 08:23.694
This ghost trap will stop
any ghoul in its tracks.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.864
You know, sometimes a ghost
just needs a good snack.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.533
Sticky Jonathan loves crumpets.

08:28.543 --> 08:30.067
Crumpets!

08:30.077 --> 08:31.970
Ghosts must be dealt with mercilessly.

08:31.980 --> 08:34.206
Do you know what happens
to people after they die?

08:34.216 --> 08:36.441
- They come back as daffodils.
- No!

08:36.451 --> 08:37.775
They come back as evil...

08:37.785 --> 08:40.111
evil specters.

08:40.121 --> 08:43.558
Now... help me stop this poltergeist.

08:45.528 --> 08:47.186
Don't touch anything. Hmm!

08:47.196 --> 08:48.519
But help me, boy.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.089
But don't touch anything.

08:50.099 --> 08:51.472
Help me, Garfield! I...

08:51.483 --> 08:53.469
- Do not touch a thing.
- I'm helping.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.548
Shh.

09:00.523 --> 09:02.470
No. No, no, no, no!

09:05.716 --> 09:08.649
You're okay. Ghost Mother
can't hurt you in here.

09:10.703 --> 09:12.947
<i>Frederick, will you be long in there?</i>

09:12.957 --> 09:16.283
What do you want, you fowl demon?!

09:16.293 --> 09:19.053
<i>Well, to have a bowel movement.</i>

09:19.063 --> 09:20.355
No.

09:20.365 --> 09:22.356
No!

09:22.366 --> 09:25.860
No, no!

09:25.870 --> 09:28.240
No!

09:29.442 --> 09:31.435
Beatrice, are you in here?

09:34.447 --> 09:35.839
Beatrice!

09:35.849 --> 09:37.045
Aw, how'd you know it was me?

09:37.056 --> 09:39.776
Well, I'm looking right at you. How
long have you been waiting there?

09:39.787 --> 09:40.807
Oh, just for all day.

09:40.818 --> 09:43.047
Look, I need your help.

09:43.057 --> 09:45.450
I want you to be my assistant.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.618
- Murder assistant?
- No.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.353
Murder has nothing to do with this task.

09:49.363 --> 09:50.486
- Oh.
- I want you to be

09:50.496 --> 09:52.656
my magic assistant. All you have to do

09:52.666 --> 09:54.090
is smile and wear a vest.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.728
Ooh, I love a nice vest.

09:55.738 --> 09:57.363
Why not let nature be your sleeves?

09:57.373 --> 09:59.965
And most importantly,
you need to look impressed

09:59.975 --> 10:01.399
when I conjure...

10:01.409 --> 10:03.404
the mystical arts!

10:03.415 --> 10:04.769
Collapsible bouquet.

10:04.779 --> 10:06.575
Yes.

10:06.586 --> 10:09.080
Okay, but let me try something else.

10:09.091 --> 10:10.143
Bet you can't figure out

10:10.153 --> 10:11.811
how the flying ball works.

10:11.821 --> 10:12.903
It's on a stick.

10:16.359 --> 10:17.683
There was an opening in the ring!

10:17.693 --> 10:20.262
Oh, and you dropped them.

10:20.696 --> 10:22.022
They're all tied together.

10:26.036 --> 10:27.661
Rise.

10:27.671 --> 10:29.162
You're using your thumb.

10:29.172 --> 10:31.398
I mean...

10:37.914 --> 10:40.475
This... this mayor.

10:40.485 --> 10:43.345
He was a fine, upstanding gentleman.

10:43.355 --> 10:45.212
- He was a girl.
- Of course, a girl.

10:45.222 --> 10:47.483
That's... what I was saying.
An upstanding woman.

10:47.493 --> 10:49.451
- She was a dog.
- Yes, a dog.

10:49.461 --> 10:52.687
A female... dog.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.724
Big, fluffy, huge... Chihuahua.

10:54.734 --> 10:56.425
Little tiny Chihuahua.

10:56.435 --> 10:57.926
But huge... huge in spirit.

10:57.936 --> 11:01.065
Huge in cuteness. A veritable mayor...

11:01.075 --> 11:03.566
of cuteness. Oh! That's right!

11:03.576 --> 11:05.936
How did you know?
That was her name... Mayor Cutie.

11:05.946 --> 11:08.404
Now, there are a lot
of dogs in the underworld.

11:08.414 --> 11:12.076
I wanna make sure I find the right dog.

11:12.086 --> 11:13.912
Anything you have of hers
would be of help.

11:13.922 --> 11:15.590
I've got a whole box.

11:17.725 --> 11:20.546
Ooh! Would this taffeta night-cape do?

11:20.557 --> 11:23.254
Yes. But a picture would do better.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.858
Ah, yes.

11:26.868 --> 11:29.360
Is this her natural hair?

11:29.370 --> 11:31.062
Uh... ah, no. That's a wig.

11:31.072 --> 11:33.565
Okay. And these spots...

11:33.575 --> 11:36.403
would you say
they're more black or brown?

11:36.413 --> 11:37.937
Brown, I think.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.639
Oh, speaking of brown...

11:39.649 --> 11:41.807
it's her gold-encrusted poop scoop.

11:43.418 --> 11:45.879
Still smells like her.

11:45.889 --> 11:48.315
How many pounds would you say she was...

11:48.325 --> 11:50.250
- or take?
- She didn't like to say.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.225
Ooh, do you wanna see her bathing suit?

11:52.236 --> 11:54.254
It's a six-piece.

11:54.264 --> 11:56.023
Three little bras running down the front

11:56.033 --> 11:57.926
for all her little tits!

11:57.936 --> 11:59.592
I think I have all the
information I need.

11:59.602 --> 12:01.629
Thank you. Now I must leave

12:01.639 --> 12:03.075
in order to prepare.

12:05.143 --> 12:06.467
Okay...

12:06.477 --> 12:08.704
it seems my smoke pellets
are not working.

12:08.714 --> 12:10.805
But imagine, if you will,
that I am leaving

12:10.815 --> 12:12.774
in a puff of smoke.

12:21.159 --> 12:23.219
Three more of these stupid gigs

12:23.229 --> 12:25.120
and "Hou-dye-nee" gets his boat, baby.

12:26.164 --> 12:27.691
Taken.

12:27.701 --> 12:30.661
Here we are. I have my assistant.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.595
- And?
- And now I can open for you

12:32.605 --> 12:34.163
like you said I could.

12:34.173 --> 12:35.632
Oh. Of course.

12:35.642 --> 12:38.000
Well, you're clear to do
five up top to open for me,

12:38.010 --> 12:39.876
but... it's not like it's free.

12:39.887 --> 12:42.607
- Have you heard of "pay to play"?
- Is that where an older neighbor

12:42.618 --> 12:44.711
puts his finger in your underwear
and gives you a butterscotch?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.593
No. That's called a "Glasgow salute."

12:46.604 --> 12:48.745
- Oh.
- And it's caramel, not butterscotch.

12:48.755 --> 12:50.715
We've got three packages.

12:50.725 --> 12:53.485
Number one: the New Faces, where I
bring you up for one quick trick.

12:53.485 --> 12:55.620
Number two: the Up & Comer,

12:55.630 --> 12:57.623
where I say "nice job"
after you're done.

12:57.633 --> 13:00.692
Or number three:
the Champagne Excelsior.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.395
You get your own show, private venue,

13:03.405 --> 13:06.800
fully nude, in front of
an audience of strangers.

13:06.810 --> 13:08.735
As far as what goes down
in that theatre...

13:08.745 --> 13:11.238
well, that's dealer's choice.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.706
Let's go with number two.

13:12.716 --> 13:13.740
Well, suit yourself.

13:14.884 --> 13:16.857
- Oh, excuse me. Magic man?
- Yes?

13:16.868 --> 13:18.845
Do you have the time?

13:18.855 --> 13:20.882
Where's your watch?

13:20.892 --> 13:23.384
- Very nice trick.
- ♪ Ta-da ♪

13:23.394 --> 13:25.052
No, don't "ta-da." It
was not your trick.

13:25.062 --> 13:26.585
- It was my trick.
- It was her trick.

13:26.596 --> 13:28.690
She's my assistant, and it was my trick.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.426
I can't believe it's only
costing me $400

13:31.436 --> 13:33.728
to solve literally all my problems.

13:35.673 --> 13:38.066
And that... that goes there...

13:38.076 --> 13:41.036
and then that goes there,
and that means...

13:41.046 --> 13:42.437
Oh, dear God.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.735
It's right there, in front of their
faces, but they're too blind to see.

13:46.552 --> 13:47.778
How can they explain the fact

13:47.788 --> 13:50.278
that Mother has always been an adult?

13:50.288 --> 13:51.681
What does it mean?

13:51.691 --> 13:53.759
What does it mean?!
What does it all mean?

13:54.587 --> 13:57.220
This is it. I am Houdini's opening act!

13:57.230 --> 13:58.621
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:58.631 --> 14:00.957
the séance is about to begin.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.793
But while Mr. Houdini is setting up,

14:02.803 --> 14:05.730
first a simple act of escape...

14:05.740 --> 14:08.100
from me, the Great Boozler.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.100
My assistant,

14:10.110 --> 14:13.938
Elaine, will now bind me.

14:13.948 --> 14:17.908
This is a regulation straightjacket.

14:17.918 --> 14:18.943
Tie it tight.

14:18.953 --> 14:20.244
I'm bored.

14:20.254 --> 14:23.916
Mm. Does anyone like watching magic?

14:25.495 --> 14:27.119
- Done!
- And now...

14:27.129 --> 14:28.486
the escape!

14:32.969 --> 14:35.387
You have to pop
your shoulder out of the socket.

14:35.398 --> 14:36.696
You're not the magician.

14:36.706 --> 14:40.033
I am. Women are not magic. Except
that one thing where you can make

14:40.043 --> 14:42.134
a human form inside of you.
That's really magic.

14:42.144 --> 14:44.837
That Elaine is beautiful.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.942
Would anybody like to see a trick?

14:48.952 --> 14:50.611
- No, thank you.
- Me, me!

14:50.621 --> 14:52.413
Frederick, pick a number.

14:52.423 --> 14:55.450
Ah... ooh, math was not my strong suit.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.817
Uh... all right.

14:57.827 --> 15:00.688
Is your number... seven?

15:00.698 --> 15:01.922
I don't remember.

15:01.932 --> 15:05.427
- It was seven!
- Wow!

15:06.471 --> 15:08.029
And for my next trick:

15:08.039 --> 15:10.199
this is a normal tablecloth

15:10.209 --> 15:12.302
and a normal table. Ready?

15:23.890 --> 15:26.750
Oh, I get it. It's Blanche.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.656
I just know the ghost is Mayor Cutie.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.959
Oh. I wonder if having been bones

15:34.969 --> 15:37.294
will change her love for them
in any way.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.464
Thank you for joining me

15:39.474 --> 15:42.466
at the table of the gods.

15:46.581 --> 15:49.241
Can anybody else see her?

15:58.894 --> 16:02.022
Shh, shh, shh. I hear something faint...

16:02.032 --> 16:06.259
an ushering in
of the all-seeing spirits.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.662
Now... anyone you'd like to see?

16:09.672 --> 16:12.432
I want to see Mother.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.201
She's right there.

16:14.211 --> 16:16.071
Mother, it's me, Frederick.

16:16.081 --> 16:18.072
- Can you hear me?
- Of course...

16:20.251 --> 16:22.210
Oh, wow. He is good.

16:25.724 --> 16:27.124
Whoa!

16:32.831 --> 16:34.557
Garfield!

16:34.567 --> 16:36.459
A supernatural presence
is close at hand.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.893
I can feel it. Set the bait, boys,

16:38.903 --> 16:40.363
set the bait.

16:40.373 --> 16:42.265
Here is paté for the ghost-dog,

16:42.275 --> 16:45.134
here is a wire hanger
for the ghost-baby.

16:45.144 --> 16:47.937
Trio of home-baked macarons for...

16:47.947 --> 16:49.572
Sticky Jonathan.

16:49.582 --> 16:53.510
But Mr. Peepers, that's my best friend.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.113
Other people will die.

16:55.123 --> 16:58.214
You'll make friends with their ghosts.

16:58.224 --> 16:59.717
Mr. Peepers,

16:59.727 --> 17:01.885
how do you know so much about ghosts?

17:04.900 --> 17:06.258
Garfield...

17:09.637 --> 17:12.797
I've never told anybody
this story before,

17:12.807 --> 17:18.002
but my great-great-great-grandpappy...

17:18.012 --> 17:20.038
was a ghost.

17:20.048 --> 17:22.941
Yes, Garfield, I have ghost blood

17:22.951 --> 17:27.446
coursing through me.
It is my family's eternal shame.

17:27.457 --> 17:30.018
Is that why they call you Spiritwalker?

17:30.028 --> 17:32.987
What? Oh, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.
They call me Spiritwalker

17:32.997 --> 17:34.822
because I walk
with such great enthusiasm.

17:34.832 --> 17:36.123
Observe.

17:38.169 --> 17:39.861
Oh!

17:39.871 --> 17:41.761
Oh, Mr. Peepers!

17:41.771 --> 17:45.834
Mister... oh! Look out!

17:45.844 --> 17:49.003
Mr. Peepers, look at you go!

17:49.013 --> 17:52.105
Oh, my goodness.

17:58.057 --> 17:59.615
Oh, please be Mayor Cutie.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.117
Please be Mayor Cutie!

18:08.067 --> 18:12.496
Here comes... a being of smoky mystery.

18:12.506 --> 18:15.499
- It's Cutie!
- The Major Cutie!

18:15.509 --> 18:18.000
- No... Mayor Cutie.
- Mayor Cutie!

18:18.010 --> 18:20.069
Come!

18:20.079 --> 18:21.838
No, no! No!

18:21.848 --> 18:23.141
If you touch that glass,

18:23.151 --> 18:25.409
you will pierce the veil between worlds.

18:25.419 --> 18:27.278
We will all surely perish.

18:27.288 --> 18:29.417
I don't care about perishing!
That's my dog in there.

18:29.428 --> 18:31.048
No!

18:31.058 --> 18:33.685
Ooh, I almost got my wrist free.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.422
Cutie!

18:37.432 --> 18:41.359
You came back from doggy heaven.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.562
It's Cutie!

18:43.572 --> 18:45.008
Wait a second.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.970
This spot is painted on!

18:49.980 --> 18:51.537
Imposter!

18:51.547 --> 18:53.239
You're a flimflam man!

18:53.249 --> 18:54.874
Well, conjure complete.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.009
I bid you adieu!

18:57.019 --> 18:58.645
God damn smoke pellets.

19:05.596 --> 19:06.954
Albert-kazam!

19:08.965 --> 19:11.826
Take him away, officers.

19:11.836 --> 19:14.062
Well, there was no spirit after all.

19:15.641 --> 19:17.031
No spirit?

19:17.041 --> 19:20.301
The trap has caught the specter!
Everybody follow.

19:21.913 --> 19:24.207
Ghost...

19:24.217 --> 19:26.276
The ghost trap has been sprung!

19:26.286 --> 19:29.287
The phantasm is among us. Stay back!

19:29.288 --> 19:32.481
Ghost Mother, you haunt me still!

19:32.491 --> 19:34.816
Oh, Frederick, I'm not a ghost.

19:34.826 --> 19:37.787
You just saw me downstairs.
Unholy wraith!

19:40.901 --> 19:43.326
Holy Christ!

19:43.336 --> 19:44.729
Mayor Cutie.

19:44.739 --> 19:49.601
He-Devil speaks the name
of the white man's lord!

19:54.348 --> 19:55.973
Hi, Daddy.

19:55.983 --> 19:57.976
I thought you were a real ghost.

19:57.986 --> 19:59.655
Hello, family.

20:05.961 --> 20:08.854
I'm sorry I thought
you were a ghost, Mother.

20:08.864 --> 20:10.557
Father was the ghost all along!

20:10.567 --> 20:12.391
He's no ghost.

20:12.401 --> 20:14.527
He's been living in the walls

20:14.537 --> 20:16.529
like some sort of rat.

20:16.539 --> 20:19.799
I built these walls.
I can live in them if I want to.

20:19.809 --> 20:21.934
You'll do no such thing.

20:21.944 --> 20:26.205
This is my house now.
You live here no more.

20:26.215 --> 20:28.976
Shrew!

20:28.986 --> 20:32.912
- What a rip-off.
- Bye, Daddy.

20:32.922 --> 20:34.692
So, am I the ghost?

20:36.445 --> 20:38.653
What should we call you?
Bark when you like one.

20:38.663 --> 20:40.389
Councilwoman Snuggles.

20:40.399 --> 20:42.191
Burgermeister Schlussi?

20:42.201 --> 20:44.160
Ooh, Guadalupe Festiva.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.428
Oh, you're right.

20:46.438 --> 20:48.596
I'll just pretend you're Mayor Cutie.

20:50.174 --> 20:52.066
I'm so sorry I killed you.

20:54.513 --> 20:56.672
I hope I don't have to do it again.
