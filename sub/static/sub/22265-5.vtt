They, um... They were going
to the Old Meadows place,

15:27.800 --> 15:29.119
out on Night Hawk Drive.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.377
Okay. How come?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.506
Evan dared us to go, and...

15:33.040 --> 15:36.544
It was stupid and creepy,
and I didn't...

15:39.360 --> 15:40.679
I... I got scared.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.302
But Evan, Shawn,

15:45.080 --> 15:47.184
they're gonna be Okay, right?

16:02.800 --> 16:04.119
- Shh.
- What?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.940
First of all, it's complimentary.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.099
Second of all,
what happened to you being nice to me?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.519
You are forgiven.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.429
SO, I talked to the other friend, Mike.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.537
And I think I got something.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.141
LOOk at this. Meet Dr. Avery Meadows.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.219
He worked here back in the early '60s.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.220
People would come to him
for help with mental illness.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.222
But no matter what they had,
depression, anxiety, whatever,

16:34.720 --> 16:35.982
the cure was always the same.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.342
He lobotomized them.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.537
Mmm. Fun.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.868
Yeah. Those that lived,
he kept as "patients."

16:44.960 --> 16:47.383
And he would experiment on them
in his house,

16:47.480 --> 16:50.586
which is exactly where Evan and Shawn
were heading that night.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.141
That's where Shawn got freaked out
and where Evan went missing?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.265
Worth a shot.
I mean, when people found out

16:58.360 --> 17:00.260
what Meadows was doing,
he was tried and executed.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.703
But who knows? You know,
maybe he made a demon deal.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.746
Or maybe he wasn't even human
to begin with.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.227
This here? _That's what Shawn
was drawmg over and over.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.181
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.346
What's up with the creepy-ass mask?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.662
It's a plague mask.
Doctors used to use them.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.227
They thought they filtered out disease.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.859
As a matter Of fact,
when they arrested Meadows,

17:22.960 --> 17:25.747
he was wearing one.
They had to hOld him down to rip it Off.

Penny. What happened?

17:37.760 --> 17:38.977
I don't know.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.101
Shawn had a bad dream.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.627
I checked on him. I...

17:48.200 --> 17:50.339
It seemed...s_eemed like
he was getting better.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.418
I went back to my room,
but it got a little cold.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.999
I thought Shawn must have
Opened a window.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.144
But when I came back in to close it,

18:02.240 --> 18:05.698
he was just gone.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.658
This is on me, man.
I saw how messed up Shawn was.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.148
I should've pushed him harder.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.622
We don't know he's dead, all right?

18:17.720 --> 18:20.666
Penny said it got cold,
so could be a ghost.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.501
Yeah, but what's a ghost doing
showing up at a kid's place?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.659
It's not like Shawn
was dragging a body around.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.825
According to the reports,
Meadows was cremated.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.980
SO maybe his spirit is tied
to something else, an object...

18:30.600 --> 18:32.067
SO, what, Shawn took something
from the house?

18:32.240 --> 18:33.343
It's possible.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.759
All right, where's the kid now?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.942
Well, Meadows "treated"
the victims at his house.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.667
SO if this is him,

18:40.800 --> 18:42.142
maybe that's where he took Shawn.

then why can't we see them?

to pierce the Veil.

to kill us?

31:12.320 --> 31:13.309
But then again,

31:13.400 --> 31:15.960
I'm not the one breaking cosmic bargains
left and right, now, am I?

31:16.400 --> 31:17.389
(SCOFFS)

31:17.800 --> 31:19.188
Yeah, it's not like you hold a grudge.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.022
Don't I?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.503
SO, spill.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.863
Lucifer's son. Jack.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.819
When he was born,
it created a little rip.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.948
-Anumrm?
-Hmm.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.701
Into another world?

31:39.960 --> 31:41.507
- And you went there?
-Hmm.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.857
Yeah, I'll just say it's...
It's not Candy Land.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.309
I'll bet.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.669
Why do you care?

31:49.160 --> 31:50.866
Because I do.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.137
Because

31:55.080 --> 31:58.777
this whole multi-versal _
quantum construct we live In,

31:59.640 --> 32:00.902
it's like a house of cards.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.739
And the last thing I need
is some big, dumb Winchester

32:05.840 --> 32:08.183
knocking it all down.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.709
Hmm.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.542
That does sound like us.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.467
You've changed.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.147
When you bargained with me just now,
you could've asked to go back, to live.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.182
Well, I figure with you in charge,
there's no getting back for me.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.219
That doesn't sound like
the Dean Winchester I know and love.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.023
The man who's been dead so many times,

32:37.120 --> 32:38.667
but it never seemed to stick.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.106
Maybe you're not that guy anymore.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.827
The guy who saves the world,

32:45.640 --> 32:47.267
the guy who always thinks he'll win

32:48.000 --> 32:49.342
no matter what.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.062
You have changed.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.463
And you tell people it's not a big deal.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.345
You tell people you'll work through it,

33:02.720 --> 33:05.587
but you know you won't. You can't.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.147
And that scares the hell out Of you.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.223
Or am I wrong?

33:15.920 --> 33:17.137
What do you want me to say?

33:18.320 --> 33:19.787
Doesn't matter.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.625
- I don't matter.
- Don't you?

33:26.840 --> 33:29.820
I couldn't save Mom.
I couldn't save Cass.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.786
I can't even save a scared little kid.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.825
Sam keeps trying to fix it,
but I just keep dragging him down.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.746
SO I'm not gonna beg.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.300
Okay, if it's my time, it's my time.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.622
You really believe that.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.062
You wanna die.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.547
Dean,

33:55.560 --> 33:58.120
every notebook on this particular shelf

33:58.800 --> 34:00.461
tells a version of how you die.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.902
You, speC/ﬁoa/iy

34:03.720 --> 34:05.187
Heart attack,

34:06.320 --> 34:08.185
burned by a red-haired witch,

34:10.080 --> 34:14.460
stabbed by a ghoul in a graveyard,
and on and on.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.541
But which one's right?

34:23.680 --> 34:25.261
That depends on you,

34:26.080 --> 34:28.219
on the choices you make.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.221
Well, I guess I made my choice.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.461
But, unfortunately,

34:39.080 --> 34:41.025
none Of these books say you die today.

34:43.680 --> 34:44.669
Come again?

34:46.280 --> 34:49.784
Since I got this new job,

34:51.200 --> 34:54.340
I stand witness to
a much larger picture.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.387
Do you know what] see?

34:59.080 --> 35:02.265
You. And your brother.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.861
You're important.

35:07.840 --> 35:08.977
Why?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.028
You have work to do.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.381
That's all you need to know.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.479
And trust me,

35:20.320 --> 35:22.902
having my eyes Opened to
the necessity of any humans,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.865
especially Winchesters,

35:25.880 --> 35:27.063
is not a thrill.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.501
SO, you wanna die,

35:32.760 --> 35:36.105
but I say keep living.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.589
Hmm.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.387
I need to know. My mom--

35:45.000 --> 35:46.103
(GASPS)

35:50.000 --> 35:51.706
Hey. You're Okay.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.027
You're okay.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.422
(IN DISTINCT CHA'I'I'ERING)

36:21.160 --> 36:22.627
DEAN: How'd it go?

36:23.360 --> 36:24.861
SAM: About how you'd figure.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.504
Hey, what happened back there?

36:29.920 --> 36:31.706
I mean, the shot didn't work,

36:31.800 --> 36:33.665
and all of a sudden you're back.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.383
I don't know. I guess it took a minute
for the drug to kick in.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.789
I guess I got luclq.

36:38.880 --> 36:39.904
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.264
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold...
Dean. Hold on a second.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.239
What about the ghosts?

36:44.320 --> 36:46.299
'Cause I checked the EMF.
They're all gone.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.262
Was that lucky, too?

36:48.640 --> 36:49.823
We can talk about it later.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.826
We won't talk about it later.
You know that.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.627
I saw Death.

37:03.360 --> 37:04.543
The Death.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.783
He's dead.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.188
No, she's not.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.022
It's Billie.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.260
I guess she got a new gig.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.987
She's the one that
took care Of the ghosts.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.465
Why would she help us?

37:21.560 --> 37:23.221
She wanted intel.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.022
She said that we're important,
that we have work to do.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.144
What the hell does that mean?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.147
I have no freakin' clue.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.149
You Okay?

37:41.120 --> 37:42.587
No.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.301
Sam, I'm not okay.
I'm pretty far from Okay.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.467
You know, my whole life,

37:54.520 --> 37:58.900
I always believed that
what we do was important.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.259
No matter what the cost,
no matter who we lost,

38:02.360 --> 38:05.500
whether it was Dad or... Or Bobby or...

38:06.760 --> 38:08.182
And I would take the hit.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.427
But I kept on fighting
because I believed

38:13.680 --> 38:15.944
that we were making the world
a better place.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.944
And now Mom and Cass...

38:22.040 --> 38:23.382
And I... I don't know.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.463
I don't know.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.861
SO now you don't believe anymore.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.719
Ijust need a win.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.301
Ijust need a damn win.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.142
(ENGINE STARTS)

39:59.640 --> 40:00.982
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:04.600 --> 40:05.669
Yeah.

40:11.880 --> 40:12.904
What?

41:29.160 --> 41:30.149
