Don't call me that.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.950
Your mother.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.986
You tried
to murder my mother.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.355
And you lied to me
about Reddington,

00:21.489 --> 00:23.791
convinced me
he was Ilya Koslov.

You abducted me for her.

your people were in danger,

01:50.043 --> 01:51.845
I would've put a trace
on the vehicle.

they know better than
to show themselves.

He'll try not to break,
but if they push him,

02:23.677 --> 02:25.213

the theatrics, Eduardo.

Please, tell me we had
better luck with the van.

shows it continued north

At that point, it turned
off the main road

surface streets.

Very possibly torture.

She wouldn't.

behaving like you would.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.510
Before you get any ideas,

36:18.644 --> 36:20.178
I have teams watching
from every angle,

36:20.312 --> 36:21.313
and I'm armed.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.686
Reddington is N-13.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.521
He has the Archive.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.623
He's the one
you've been looking for.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.628
Say something.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.865
Did you hear me?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.503
REDDINGTON: No,
I don't believe he did.
(GUN COCKS)

36:49.641 --> 36:50.642
The pistol.

37:03.789 --> 37:04.656
Dominic's dead.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.360
He wasn't
when I left him.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.029
No matter.
You killed him,

37:11.162 --> 37:13.532
just as sure as I killed
poor Heidegger there.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.236
Am I supposed to feel
something about that?

37:18.370 --> 37:20.138
Dom set me up,

37:20.272 --> 37:23.642
led me to what was supposed
to be my public slaughter.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.477
Think what you want,

37:25.611 --> 37:27.679
but I won't be shedding
any tears for that monster.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.681
No, I wouldn't think so.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.757
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
You've reached
Elizabeth Keen's voicemail.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.058
Please leave me a message.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.309
Dembe?

37:57.443 --> 37:58.276
LIZ: No, Ressler. It's me.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.878
Keen?

38:00.011 --> 38:01.447
I'm sorry. We...

38:01.580 --> 38:03.248
We got here too late.
Dom's gone.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.484
I know.
You do? How? Where are you?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.252
Why are you calling me
from Dembe's phone?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.555
Ressler, listen to me.
He's going to kill her.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.457
Reddington's on his way
to kill my mother.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.591
Hold on. Slow down.
She's there now.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.360
The park
on Wabash and Grant.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.594
That's where
he's gonna meet her.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.363
You got to send
units there now.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.030
Done. But, Keen,
you got to realize

38:19.164 --> 38:21.600
the best-case scenario here
is we arrest her.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.901
Then arrest her.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.370
Just get there. Now.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.538
Where are you?
I'm on my way,
but I'm unarmed.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.906
You got to stop him.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.443
All those years
searching for answers,

38:31.577 --> 38:33.812
and you were right
in front of me
the whole time.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.747
For what it's worth,
I didn't know

38:35.881 --> 38:38.149
what Dom was planning
in Belgrade.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.485
I believe you.

38:39.618 --> 38:43.555
But after, you let
the world believe the lie.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.824
You dangled me
out there,

38:45.957 --> 38:48.126
let everyone think
I had the Archive.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.097
And now I know why.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.765
Because if they were
chasing me,

38:53.899 --> 38:55.434
it meant
they weren't chasing you.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.069
It's not
quite that simple.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.305
You're N-13,
aren't you?

39:00.439 --> 39:03.274
You framed me.
You fed me to
Townsend as a patsy,

39:03.409 --> 39:05.977
and Dominic knew
and helped you do it.

39:06.111 --> 39:10.115
Sir. Sir, I just got off
the phone with Agent Ressler,
and he's gonna do it.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.983
Mr. Reddington's
really gonna do it.
Do what?

39:12.117 --> 39:14.520
He's gonna kill
Agent Keen's mother.
City Park.

39:14.653 --> 39:15.854
Wabash and Grant.
They're there now.

39:15.987 --> 39:16.988
Scramble units.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.326
I could've helped you

39:21.460 --> 39:23.429
the way I always have,

39:24.663 --> 39:27.165
kept you
one step ahead.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.367
But staying safe
wasn't enough.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.170
You needed answers.

39:32.303 --> 39:33.672
Well, now you have them.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.708
And now they've
destroyed you.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.347
What if I promised
never to tell a soul
what I've learned?

39:42.481 --> 39:44.716
Well, that would be
the last lie you ever told.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.154
You won't kill me.

39:49.287 --> 39:50.522
You can't.

39:51.757 --> 39:52.991
Why is that?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.526
Because Elizabeth
would never forgive you.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.695
You don't know a damn thing
about Elizabeth.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.329
Oh, that's not true.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.731
I've gotten to know her.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.901
She chose me.
She's helping me.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.036
She has no idea
who you are.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.839
Me? I'm her mother.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.346
And even now,
there's love there.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.025
I can't let you leave.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.326
(CHUCKLES)

40:28.460 --> 40:30.596
My God.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.799
I can't imagine what
this must be like for you,

40:33.932 --> 40:35.433
knowing you can't kill me

40:35.567 --> 40:38.136
because of how much
Elizabeth loves her mother.
