00:09.631 --> 00:14.652
Hey, Ally. Want to go to the zoo
later and laugh at the monkeys?

00:14.653 --> 00:16.746
Can't. I'm meeting a
record label on Wednesday

00:16.747 --> 00:19.150
and I still have to finish
three songs for my demo.

00:19.151 --> 00:23.936
And my dad's out sick, so now I
have to watch the store, and...

00:23.937 --> 00:27.359
Are you guys putting
salami on cereal?

00:27.360 --> 00:31.144
Yep. We couldn't decide if we wanted
breakfast or lunch, so we're having both.

00:31.145 --> 00:34.145
We call it "blunch".

00:34.700 --> 00:35.893
Mmm.

00:35.894 --> 00:37.834
Frosted crispy bites and salami.

00:37.835 --> 00:41.495
Is there a better combination?

00:41.672 --> 00:43.560
How can you eat that?

00:43.561 --> 00:45.861
Oh, she's right. We
forgot the mustard.

00:45.862 --> 00:47.662
Mm.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.100
Oh.

00:54.472 --> 00:59.160
Guess who got a job as a
Pioneer Rangers Troop Leader?

00:59.161 --> 01:00.799
Let me rephrase that.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.620
Guess whose mom forced her
to get a non-paying job

01:03.621 --> 01:07.584
as her brother's Pioneer
Rangers Troop Leader?

01:07.585 --> 01:10.717
Sorry. I know how much you
don't like the outdoors.

01:10.718 --> 01:13.642
Or your little brother.

01:13.643 --> 01:17.308
I used to be a Pioneer Ranger. But I
got kicked out after a camping trip.

01:17.309 --> 01:21.929
Apparently bird baths
are for "birds only".

01:23.015 --> 01:26.250
One of my biggest regrets is that I
never earned a single merit badge.

01:26.251 --> 01:28.986
Well, today hasn't
been a total loss.

01:28.987 --> 01:32.389
In addition to learning how to make
an outdoor bathroom out of rocks,

01:32.390 --> 01:34.768
I actually booked Austin
on "Video Countdown Live".

01:34.769 --> 01:36.260
Awesome!

01:36.261 --> 01:39.712
The video countdown thing. Not
the outdoor bathroom thing.

01:39.713 --> 01:43.739
You guys have to write a new song because
Austin's gonna be on "New Music Tuesday".

01:43.740 --> 01:45.805
A new song for
Austin by Tuesday?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.198
I'm already working on
three songs for myself.

01:48.199 --> 01:52.276
A little trivia, know why they
call it "New Music Tuesday?"

01:52.277 --> 01:56.027
Because people play their new
music and it's on a Tuesday?

01:56.028 --> 01:59.208
Oh... you already know.

02:57.536 --> 03:00.865
All right, rangers, if you
want your Knot Tying Badge,

03:00.866 --> 03:04.743
you're gonna have to be able to
complete the Impossible Knot.

03:04.744 --> 03:07.512
Please. Already finished.

03:07.513 --> 03:09.276
Impossible Knot...

03:09.277 --> 03:11.857
Impossible not!

03:12.378 --> 03:13.943
It's easy to tie.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.304
It's impossible to untie.

03:18.139 --> 03:20.239
Aw man.

03:20.888 --> 03:24.208
Hi, Trish. I'm here for
the pie eater rangers.

03:24.209 --> 03:29.135
Nelson, it's the Pioneer Rangers,
not the pie eater rangers.

03:29.136 --> 03:30.769
Aw, nartz.

03:30.770 --> 03:35.516
You know how long it took
to bake this key lime pie?

03:35.517 --> 03:38.884
Oh, cool. You're having a
Pioneer Rangers meeting.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.935
Oh, I haven't been to
one of those in years.

03:41.936 --> 03:44.404
Mind if I join?

03:44.405 --> 03:46.076
Sure.

03:46.077 --> 03:50.152
Hey J.J., why don't you show Dez
how to tie an Impossible Knot?

03:50.153 --> 03:52.110
Why do they call it
an Impossible Knot?

03:52.111 --> 03:54.501
You'll see.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.740
So Austin, how's the new song coming?
The show's tomorrow night.

03:57.741 --> 03:59.827
We haven't started yet,
but I'm not worried.

03:59.828 --> 04:02.347
Ally and I have written
songs in a day before.

04:02.348 --> 04:04.498
So Ally, when can we start?

04:04.499 --> 04:06.762
Well, I still have to finish
my songs for my demo,

04:06.763 --> 04:09.051
but I think I could
squeeze you in at 4:30.

04:09.052 --> 04:10.464
- Great.
- A.M.

04:10.465 --> 04:12.985
Not so great.

04:13.121 --> 04:15.890
I know. Why don't I
just write the song?

04:15.891 --> 04:19.760
Are you sure? You've never written
a song by yourself before.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.486
Maybe it's time I did.

04:21.487 --> 04:25.131
Austin, I can help you with
your song and then finish mine.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.488
No no. You've got
too much to do.

04:27.489 --> 04:30.543
Seriously, I can write a song.

04:30.544 --> 04:34.175
I've been learning from the best
songwriter in the business.

04:34.176 --> 04:36.773
Can't argue with that.
But still...

04:36.774 --> 04:41.023
Ally. I'm Austin Moon.
I can do anything.

04:41.024 --> 04:43.184
Oh yeah.

04:44.019 --> 04:45.920
Can you untie an
Impossible Knot?

04:45.921 --> 04:48.405
Why don't you just
use these scissors?

04:48.406 --> 04:50.926
Oh yeah. Duh.

04:57.327 --> 05:00.034
I would have brought
them to you.

05:00.035 --> 05:01.835
Oh.

05:07.809 --> 05:11.879
Okay, Austin. I got you a couple of
things to help you with your songwriting.

05:11.880 --> 05:16.647
Here's some paper and some pencils
for you to write down your ideas.

05:16.648 --> 05:19.408
I sharpened them.

05:19.427 --> 05:20.754
Cool. Thanks.

05:20.755 --> 05:24.792
Oh, and I packed you a
lunch and some snacks.

05:24.793 --> 05:26.827
Ally, I'm not a little kid.

05:26.828 --> 05:29.288
Ooh, pudding!

05:31.900 --> 05:34.480
I'll be fine.

05:35.670 --> 05:38.111
Hey, buddy. How's the
songwriting going?

05:38.112 --> 05:40.512
Oh! Pudding!

05:40.644 --> 05:43.844
So, how's the songwriting going?

05:43.845 --> 05:48.045
Let me show you
what I have so far.

05:51.753 --> 05:54.164
That's all I got.

05:54.165 --> 05:55.689
Can I be honest?

05:55.690 --> 05:58.637
I think it still
needs a lot of work.

05:58.638 --> 06:02.141
What am I gonna do? I need a song
by tomorrow, and I have nothing.

06:02.142 --> 06:03.897
I know you can write a song.

06:03.898 --> 06:06.604
You just need someone
to bounce ideas off of.

06:06.605 --> 06:08.252
Huh? Try me.

06:08.253 --> 06:14.153
Okay. Let's start with the melody.
What do you think of this?

06:17.812 --> 06:21.335
- Man, that's "the alphabet song".
- Yeah, but it's really catchy.

06:46.708 --> 06:50.343
How does painting your nails
earn us a Lifesaving Badge?

06:50.344 --> 06:53.014
My regular mani-pedi
girl is out sick today.

06:53.015 --> 06:56.689
So you guys are
totally lifesavers.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.425
I think you just need
some inspiration.

06:59.426 --> 07:00.761
Let's go see a horror movie!

07:00.762 --> 07:04.389
Hey, Austin. Jett Deely just
called to say he's really excited

07:04.390 --> 07:07.136
that you're performing on "Video
Countdown Live" tomorrow.

07:07.137 --> 07:09.649
So how's the new song coming?

07:09.650 --> 07:12.162
Great. I'm almost finished.

07:12.163 --> 07:16.773
Yep. Except for the music, the lyrics,
and a song title, it's pretty much done.

07:16.774 --> 07:19.198
Well, you better get cracking.

07:19.199 --> 07:23.002
All right, troop. Who wants
to earn their Science Badge?

07:23.003 --> 07:25.611
Cool! Are we going to a museum?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.805
Nope. But you get to do
my science homework.

07:28.806 --> 07:32.593
You're kind of lazy, aren't you?

07:32.594 --> 07:34.874
Let's go.

07:38.565 --> 07:40.485
So...

07:40.863 --> 07:42.623
Should we go see
that horror movie?

07:42.624 --> 07:44.283
I don't think
anything's gonna help.

07:44.284 --> 07:49.327
Don't give up now. Always remember
the Pioneer Ranger motto.

07:49.328 --> 07:51.832
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.143
Let me check the handbook.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.416
Oh.

07:55.417 --> 07:57.770
"Be strong, be brave,
always behave.

07:57.771 --> 08:01.956
Be loyal, be kind, leave
no ranger behind".

08:01.957 --> 08:04.746
Hey, that almost
sounds like a song.

08:04.747 --> 08:10.507
Maybe there's something in that
book that will inspire us.

08:12.954 --> 08:16.339
Well, it took all night,
but we finished it.

08:16.340 --> 08:20.166
Yep. I didn't think we'd get
through a whole case of pudding.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.542
But we did.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.535
No, the song. Let's
play it one more time.

08:25.536 --> 08:29.970
<i>♪ If you're alone in the woods,
and you feel you're in danger...</i>

08:29.971 --> 08:31.435

08:33.676 --> 08:34.692
Woo.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.102
Awesome. You know where that
song would sound great?

08:37.102 --> 08:38.874
At a Pioneer Rangers meeting.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.784
You know where that
song won't sound great?

08:40.784 --> 08:44.944
On live TV in front
of a million people.

08:44.945 --> 08:48.491
Hey, buddy. Look on
the bright side.

08:48.492 --> 08:51.011
I found another cup of pudding.

08:51.012 --> 08:53.292
Splitsies?!

09:03.720 --> 09:07.057
What am I gonna do, Dez? I don't
have a song to perform tonight.

09:07.058 --> 09:09.167
Just tell Ally you
need her help.

09:09.168 --> 09:13.402
I can't. I made such a big deal
that I could write on my own.

09:13.403 --> 09:16.107
I'm Austin Moon. I'm supposed
to be able to do anything.

09:16.108 --> 09:20.608
So just tell her you're
not Austin Moon.

09:21.397 --> 09:22.844
Why'd you take my fork?

09:22.845 --> 09:26.350
I'm trying to get
my Recycling Badge.

09:26.351 --> 09:27.894
Want it back?

09:27.895 --> 09:30.952
You want me to use a dirty
fork out of the trash?

09:30.953 --> 09:33.893
I'm not an animal.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.863
If you're too proud to
ask for Ally's help,

09:39.864 --> 09:43.179
you need to figure out a way
to get her to offer her help.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.389
How do I do that?

09:44.390 --> 09:46.204
Just play her the
horrible song you wrote.

09:46.205 --> 09:49.691
She'll feel so bad that you failed,
there's no way she won't help you.

09:49.692 --> 09:53.410
And boy did you fail miserably.

09:53.411 --> 09:55.504
Hey, we wrote that
song together.

09:55.505 --> 09:57.049
Oh yeah.

09:57.050 --> 10:02.950
Now that you mention it, the
parts I wrote weren't too bad.

10:06.225 --> 10:09.903
Hey, Trish. I did it. I finished
writing all the songs for my demo.

10:09.904 --> 10:11.725
That's great, Ally.

10:11.726 --> 10:14.840
Hey, these rangers are about
to earn their Chore Badges.

10:14.841 --> 10:18.343
Got anything you want washed,
polished, or cooked?

10:18.344 --> 10:21.027
We're supposed to
be Pioneer Rangers.

10:21.028 --> 10:24.568
Not your personal assistants.

10:24.657 --> 10:25.728
Yeah.

10:25.729 --> 10:30.793
If you don't teach us some survival
skills, I'm gonna tell mom.

10:30.794 --> 10:32.364
Here's a survival skill.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.205
Tell mom and you won't survive.

10:36.347 --> 10:40.491
- We'll go do your laundry.
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.492 --> 10:43.327
You really have a way with kids.

10:43.328 --> 10:47.493
It's the wrong way,
but it's a way.

10:47.494 --> 10:49.839
Ally! I did it. I wrote a song.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.569
I am so proud of you, Austin.

10:52.570 --> 10:57.308
You said you didn't need
my help, and you didn't.

10:57.309 --> 10:58.934
I remember.

10:58.935 --> 11:02.280
Because I made a pretty
big deal about it.

11:02.281 --> 11:03.909
Here, I'll play it for you.

11:03.910 --> 11:05.777
We want your honest opinion.

11:05.778 --> 11:08.714
If there's any little thing
you want to have changed,

11:08.715 --> 11:12.495
even if it's the whole song...

11:13.158 --> 11:15.392
Feel free.

11:15.393 --> 11:17.847

11:37.115 --> 11:38.975
Wow.

11:40.118 --> 11:41.823
That's...

11:41.824 --> 11:44.104
Your song.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.842
It uh, rhymes.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.929
So what do you think?

11:50.930 --> 11:52.790
I...

11:53.298 --> 11:55.739
Love it. It is so catchy.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.620
So is chicken pox.

11:58.754 --> 12:00.382
Trish.

12:00.383 --> 12:04.103
Can I talk to you for a sec?

12:06.311 --> 12:08.620
You can't make fun
of Austin's song.

12:08.621 --> 12:10.225
It's terrible.

12:10.226 --> 12:15.576
I know, but it's the first song he ever
wrote by himself, and he loves it.

12:15.577 --> 12:20.669
Well, if he performs that song on
live TV, his career will be crushed.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.898
And I can't believe
Ally liked the song.

12:22.899 --> 12:25.956
She was supposed to hate it
and then write me a new one.

12:25.957 --> 12:27.265
Well...

12:27.266 --> 12:29.295
She is the songwriter.

12:29.296 --> 12:33.104
Maybe it's better than we think?

12:33.105 --> 12:35.085
Maybe.

12:36.108 --> 12:39.588
- No way.
- It's terrible.

12:43.602 --> 12:45.336
Austin?

12:45.337 --> 12:48.649
I have something
horrible to tell you.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.877
Your song is...

12:50.878 --> 12:52.497
Awful!

12:52.498 --> 12:54.388
Just terrible.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.373
And why are you so
happy about that?

12:56.374 --> 13:00.231
I'm not! I just figured if I
said it with a smile on my face,

13:00.232 --> 13:03.155
it wouldn't hurt your
feelings as much.

13:03.156 --> 13:06.636
Huh. Kind of worked. Weird.

13:06.965 --> 13:08.788
Look, I know the song stinks.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.215
Can you help me write a new
one before the show tonight?

13:11.216 --> 13:14.635
Austin, there's not enough time.

13:14.636 --> 13:17.276
But I just finished
my demo songs.

13:17.277 --> 13:20.589
Maybe you can use one of those.

13:20.590 --> 13:24.506
- I can't take one of your songs.
- Austin, really. I want you to.

13:24.507 --> 13:28.565
No, really. I can't. These
songs are too girly.

13:28.566 --> 13:30.892
"Putting on my makeup for
a night on the town.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.009
Crushing on a boy, I
hope he's around".

13:34.010 --> 13:37.160
Yeah. It sounds better
when I sing it.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.437
Maybe I just have to call
"Video Countdown Live"

13:39.438 --> 13:42.106
and come up with an excuse to
get out of doing the show.

13:42.107 --> 13:45.276
Oh, I've got a great excuse for you.
Tell them your grandma...

13:45.277 --> 13:48.637
Got abducted by an alien.

13:49.114 --> 13:51.722
Well that's the dumbest
excuse I've ever heard.

13:51.723 --> 13:53.033
Oh yeah?

13:53.034 --> 13:56.188
Tell that to my grandma.

13:56.189 --> 13:58.322
Well, I wish I could help
you figure this out,

13:58.323 --> 14:01.681
but I have to go take
the rangers camping.

14:01.682 --> 14:06.141
That's it. Austin, just tell Jett
Deely you have to reschedule,

14:06.142 --> 14:09.085
because you're volunteering
with a Scout Troop.

14:09.086 --> 14:12.606
That's good, Ally. Man,
you're getting good at lying.

14:12.607 --> 14:15.247
I know! Oh no.

14:17.242 --> 14:19.642
Okay. Great.

14:20.786 --> 14:22.201
What did he say?

14:22.202 --> 14:24.845
Well, he bought the story that
I'm taking the kids camping.

14:24.846 --> 14:26.089
- That's great.
- What a relief.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.252
- Problem solved.
- And since I can't come to the show,

14:28.253 --> 14:30.087
he's bringing the show to me.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.974
He's gonna film me singing my
new song at the campground.

14:32.975 --> 14:34.191
- That's awful.
- We're doomed.

14:34.192 --> 14:37.552
We're going camping! Woo!

14:44.679 --> 14:48.850
Are you sure you can't use one of
the new songs I've been working on?

14:48.851 --> 14:51.597
Wait. How about this one?

14:51.598 --> 14:54.050
<i>♪ Driving in my car,
top rolled down.</i>

14:54.051 --> 14:56.024
<i>♪ Hanging with my friends,
night on the town.</i>

14:56.025 --> 14:58.260
<i>♪ I'm a girl, I'm a girl.</i>

14:58.261 --> 15:00.901
<i>♪ I'm a girl.</i>

15:03.710 --> 15:06.201
Okay, maybe you can't.

15:06.202 --> 15:11.139
What am I gonna do? Jett's gonna film
me in like two hours at the campsite.

15:11.140 --> 15:14.500
Check it out. Still fits.

15:16.531 --> 15:19.289
Aren't you a little old
to be a Pioneer Ranger?

15:19.290 --> 15:25.190
Hey, from a boy to a man, you're a
Pioneer Ranger as long as you stand.

15:25.643 --> 15:28.041
I'm ready to go camping.

15:28.042 --> 15:29.924
Aw, nartz.

15:29.925 --> 15:31.994
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

15:31.995 --> 15:35.775
My Teddy Bear's name is Nartz.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.283
Aw, nartz.

15:47.012 --> 15:49.844
Why are you making me
bring our whole house?

15:49.845 --> 15:53.042
We're only staying one night.

15:53.043 --> 15:56.522
We're staying there overnight?

15:56.523 --> 15:59.429
You're gonna have to go
back and get my bed.

15:59.430 --> 16:03.432
When we get to camp, you can't just
watch TV and take a bubble bath.

16:03.433 --> 16:07.860
We have badges to earn, like
bird calling, and music.

16:07.861 --> 16:10.665
Hey. Those badges
give me an idea.

16:10.666 --> 16:14.626
Oh, me too. I love
calling birds.

16:14.970 --> 16:17.730
Hello, Miami zoo?

16:20.104 --> 16:23.011
No. The Music Badge.

16:23.012 --> 16:27.793
Austin, you can tell Jett Deely you wrote
"the ranger song" as a gift for the kids.

16:27.794 --> 16:30.273
I can teach the troop
to sing backup for you.

16:30.274 --> 16:32.135
That's a great idea.

16:32.136 --> 16:34.896
Rangers, line up.

16:35.431 --> 16:36.958
Let me try that again.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.994
Get in a line before I make
you drop and give me 20!

16:39.995 --> 16:43.415
And not push-ups. Dollars!

16:43.844 --> 16:46.004
Move it!

16:48.572 --> 16:50.834
Austin, what are you doing?

16:50.835 --> 16:54.495
I don't know. She scared me.

17:03.852 --> 17:06.121
Did I do this right?

17:06.122 --> 17:08.402
Aw, nartz.

17:08.801 --> 17:10.204
Looks good to me.

17:10.205 --> 17:13.086
- Nelson!
- Nelson!

17:15.232 --> 17:16.604
Dez!

17:16.605 --> 17:19.740
You used all the marshmallows
for our S'mores.

17:19.741 --> 17:25.641
I'm making an authentic marshmallow
teepee like some Native American tribes.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.699
Austin Moon.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.810
Ready to go live?

17:28.811 --> 17:31.546
Uh, yeah. Sure. Just give
me a few minutes to...

17:31.547 --> 17:36.689
And we're live. I'm Jett Deely.
Countdown Live's New Music Tuesday...

17:36.690 --> 17:39.162
We're broadcasting from the
Pioneer Ranger campsite,

17:39.163 --> 17:42.166
with special guest Austin Moon.

17:42.167 --> 17:46.461
Great to be here, Jett. I'm gonna sing
a special song I wrote for these kids.

17:46.462 --> 17:48.896
Keep that in mind
when you hear it.

17:48.897 --> 17:50.759
Austin Moon is so generous.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.464
Oh hey, there is Ally Dawson,
Austin's songwriter.

17:53.465 --> 17:55.645
Didn't write this one.

17:55.646 --> 17:57.839
And I'm not his manager
for this one either.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.787
And I'm not his friend
for this one either.

18:01.788 --> 18:04.788
Okay. Ready, rangers?

18:08.184 --> 18:11.953
<i>♪ If you're alone in the woods,
and you feel you're in danger.</i>

18:11.954 --> 18:13.121
<i>♪ What do you do?</i>

18:13.122 --> 18:15.353
<i>♪ - Call a Pioneer Ranger!
- Call a Pioneer Ranger!</i>

18:15.354 --> 18:18.960
<i>♪ If you're kicked by a
moose, don't call a stranger.</i>

18:18.961 --> 18:20.032
<i>♪ What do you do?</i>

18:20.033 --> 18:21.996
<i>♪ - Call a Pioneer Ranger!

18:21.997 --> 18:25.200
<i>♪ If your bike's got a flat,
and you need a tire changer.</i>

18:25.201 --> 18:26.834
<i>♪ What do you do?</i>

18:26.835 --> 18:28.803
<i>♪ - Call a Pioneer Ranger!
- Call a Pioneer Ranger!</i>

18:28.804 --> 18:30.138
<i>♪ A Pioneer Ranger!</i>

18:30.139 --> 18:32.140
<i>♪ A Pioneer Ranger!</i>

18:32.141 --> 18:34.241
<i>♪ Yeah!</i>

18:34.269 --> 18:36.129
Woo!

18:36.390 --> 18:39.217
- That was an awesome song, Austin.
- Woo!

18:39.218 --> 18:44.924
All right. That's Austin Moon with
a song he wrote just for the kids.

18:44.925 --> 18:48.799
- Thanks for having me. Had a lot of fun.
- Well hey, the fun's just getting started.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.125
Huh? I thought that
was all the fun.

18:51.126 --> 18:55.261
When we come back, Austin's
gonna sing his real new song.

18:55.262 --> 18:57.917
Back live in two minutes.

18:57.918 --> 18:59.304
What am I gonna do?

18:59.305 --> 19:03.011
Hey, when your career's in
danger, you know what to do.

19:03.012 --> 19:05.746
Call a Pioneer Ranger.

19:05.747 --> 19:08.197
Wait. That's it.

19:08.198 --> 19:12.814
We can use the Pioneer Rangers to stall
Jett and his crew and stop the broadcast.

19:12.815 --> 19:15.051
Great idea.

19:15.052 --> 19:16.655
Hey, Jett.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.648
J.J. wants to show you
his Impossible Knot.

19:19.649 --> 19:21.397
Ooh.

19:21.398 --> 19:23.251
You're getting
good at being bad.

19:23.252 --> 19:25.892
I know! Oh no.

19:26.596 --> 19:29.040
Very impressive, kid.

19:29.041 --> 19:32.281
Oh, okay. Now untie me.

19:32.425 --> 19:35.262
Sorry, dude. I haven't
earned my untying badge yet.

19:35.263 --> 19:37.668
Guys, come help
me out over here.

19:37.669 --> 19:40.300
There are some scissors
in that tent over there.

19:40.301 --> 19:44.201
Nelson, why don't you show them?

19:50.986 --> 19:54.471
This will work. We just have to keep
them occupied till the show's over.

19:54.472 --> 19:58.148
I just hope the show's over before that
bear finishes eating my marshmallow teepee.

19:58.149 --> 19:59.612
He looks hungry.

19:59.613 --> 20:01.593
Bear?!

20:04.189 --> 20:07.129
Run for your lives!

20:08.871 --> 20:14.451
We can't just leave Jett tied up here.
What do we do?

20:14.556 --> 20:17.126
If it's a black bear, you're
supposed to make a lot of noise.

20:17.127 --> 20:19.070
If it's a brown bear,
you play dead.

20:19.071 --> 20:23.691
- What color is it?
- I think it's black.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.630
Ah!

20:25.631 --> 20:27.516
Or maybe it's dark brown.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.210
Making noise!

20:29.211 --> 20:31.671
Playing dead.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.705
Making noise!

20:33.706 --> 20:36.000
Playing dead.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.888
Making noise!

20:37.889 --> 20:40.349
Playing dead.

20:42.136 --> 20:44.596
- Ah!
- Run!

20:44.638 --> 20:47.037
Help! Still tied up here.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.712
Oh!

20:48.713 --> 20:50.077
Quick, untie me.

20:50.078 --> 20:52.527
You're in luck, because I
spent all night last night

20:52.528 --> 20:55.628
learning how to untie
the Impossible Knot.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.437
Faster!

20:56.438 --> 20:58.686
You're in luck because I
spent all last night...

20:58.687 --> 21:01.207
No, untie me!

21:07.450 --> 21:10.539
Woo. That was a close call.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.959
I'm glad Jett and the
rangers all made it out.

21:12.960 --> 21:17.640
I guess you could say
we "bear" ly escaped.

21:18.841 --> 21:20.897
Too soon?

21:20.898 --> 21:25.278
No amount of time
will make that funny.

21:25.302 --> 21:27.859
Look, I'm really sorry
that I didn't have

21:27.860 --> 21:30.719
enough time to help you
write your new song.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.112
I get it. You've got your
own music to focus on now.

21:34.113 --> 21:36.490
We'll just have to figure
out how to make this work.

21:36.491 --> 21:38.496
I hope so, because...

21:38.497 --> 21:42.397
I'm always gonna need you, Ally.

21:42.965 --> 21:45.967
That's so sweet, Austin.

21:45.968 --> 21:48.188
Bear hug?

21:53.253 --> 21:56.465
I can't imagine writing
songs without you.

21:56.466 --> 21:59.690
It would be un "bear" able.

21:59.691 --> 22:02.808
How many more of those
bear jokes do you have?

22:02.809 --> 22:05.629
Eh, six or seven.

22:13.043 --> 22:18.943
All right, J.J., here's your Knot
Tying Badge, your Music Badge...

22:19.026 --> 22:21.394
And your pretty cool
Little Brother Badge.

22:21.395 --> 22:22.647
Thanks, sis.

22:22.648 --> 22:25.488
Oh, by the way, I need you to
hike my tub and TV back home.

22:25.489 --> 22:27.989
I knew there was a catch.

22:27.990 --> 22:31.959
Nelson, you're next. Here is
your Track and Field Badge.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.225
- When that bear showed up, you...
- Cool!

22:34.226 --> 22:36.539
Really ran fast.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.203
My turn!

22:38.204 --> 22:41.135
And now for our honorary
Pioneer Ranger.

22:41.136 --> 22:46.232
We've got the Music Badge,
the Recycling Badge...

22:46.233 --> 22:50.172
The Architecture Badge,
and the Lifesaving Badge.

22:50.173 --> 22:53.313
Finally. I got my merit badges.

22:53.314 --> 22:55.174
Woo!

23:01.608 --> 23:04.530
Run for your lives!

23:04.531 --> 23:06.316
Ah!
