WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:02.503
You can't just say you
have feelings for George

00:02.536 --> 00:04.372
and then say,
"Oops, never mind!"

00:04.405 --> 00:07.075
Hey, I am very, very sorry!

00:07.108 --> 00:09.277
I can't be in the
same place as Zoe Hart.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.245
If you really do think
we belong together,

00:11.279 --> 00:13.381
you will start
over with me,

00:13.414 --> 00:14.782
someplace else.
WANDA:
 Tansy left

00:14.815 --> 00:16.484
last night.
Like "left George Tucker" left?

00:16.517 --> 00:17.351
I'd say that's a good bet.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.787
Being rational is
kind of overrated.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.555
Are we getting married?
Uh-huh.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.057
LEMON: You and AnnaBeth
 seem right together.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.425
It inspires me to find
the right person, too.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.459
I'm going on tour tomorrow,

00:25.493 --> 00:28.096
and I could use an extra voice
 on the road.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.398
Where are we going?
Not we, me. New York.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.799
(tires screech)
WADE:
 You were right.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.101
Look, I have changed!

00:33.134 --> 00:34.402
Which is why
I'm going after her.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.170
I came all this way
to tell you that...

00:36.204 --> 00:37.405
I love you.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.207
Wow.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.808
I was kind of hoping
for more than a "wow."

00:40.841 --> 00:42.410
I'm gonna spend the summer
in New York.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.445
I'll see you
in three months, Doc.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.548
(crowd cheering,
band playing upbeat march)

01:12.173 --> 01:13.274
Dr. Hart!

01:15.276 --> 01:16.477
Where are you?!

01:18.212 --> 01:19.247
(distorted):
Come back!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.448
(cheering fades)

01:20.481 --> 01:22.183
WOMAN:
 Wake up.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.551
Wake up.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.153
Nap's over, lazy ass.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.587
You got rounds.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.457
(indistinct chatter)

01:34.495 --> 01:36.364
ZOE:
Run a chem seven, CBC.

01:36.397 --> 01:39.233
Mrs. Abrams, room 82,
needs an echo.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.470
Get Ms. Rami in bed 11 in for
a double bypass this afternoon.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.173
Mr. Diamond in room 43,
he can be released

01:45.206 --> 01:48.176
only if he promises to get his
pacemaker checked in two weeks.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.411
You can tell his daughter
because she'll remind...

01:51.512 --> 01:53.147
Meatball?

01:54.182 --> 01:55.616
What?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.418
Sorry.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.188
I was just listing
my favorite sandwiches.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.591
(groans softly)

02:09.197 --> 02:10.497
Lemon?

02:12.533 --> 02:13.901
MAN:
Hey.

02:13.934 --> 02:14.602
Hi, honey.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.438
Joel, what are you doing here?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.906
Well,

02:18.939 --> 02:20.641
I had the worst
writer's block ever.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.411
Needed an ego boost, so I
loitered in the fiction section

02:23.444 --> 02:26.214
of the Strand until
someone recognized me.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.515
I have issues.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.516
Don't judge.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.218
Me? Judge.
(scoffs)

02:30.251 --> 02:31.652
I'm swimming in issues.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.254
(chuckles)

02:39.560 --> 02:42.396
JOEL:
Beet salad with celery root,

02:42.430 --> 02:45.299
grilled fennel and...

02:45.333 --> 02:47.201
cold poached salmon.
What?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.736
This is so sweet.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.471
But what is
the occasion?

02:50.504 --> 02:53.407
Oh, they accepted our offer
on the apartment.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.475
No way!

02:54.508 --> 02:56.410
All that's left is to be
approved by the co-op board.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.312
We meet them
Friday at 9:00 a.m.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.313
I cannot believe this.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.681
That is my dream apartment.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.683
Yes!

03:02.716 --> 03:05.686
Shmancy novelist.
Semi-shmancy surgeon.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.656
We are going to breeze
past that co-op board.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.392
Uh, actually, uh,
your former business partner...

03:11.425 --> 03:12.593
Dr. Breemore?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.362
Breeland. Brick.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.397
Brick. Right. Still hilarious.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.500
He hasn't sent in his reference
letter the board asked for.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.768
Are you sure
you asked him for it?
Yeah.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.337
No, I wrote it all up for him.
All he had to do was sign it.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.572
I overnighted it
to him weeks ago.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.774
Why didn't he do it? Did you
leave on bad terms or something?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.576
I left on good terms
with everyone.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.586
Rose?

03:38.619 --> 03:41.722
Is that you? Is that really you?

03:41.755 --> 03:44.325
Duh. And it was really me
when you pretended

03:44.358 --> 03:45.793
you didn't know me
five minutes ago.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.297
Okay. I know how that may
have looked, but...

03:49.330 --> 03:50.230
Remember how you promised

03:50.264 --> 03:52.433
we'd spend my 16th birthday
in New York?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.468
Well, my 16th birthday
was yesterday.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.271
So I had to come here with
the model U.N. field trip.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.406
I'm Egypt.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.309
And my stupid, idiot classmates
got into a food fight,

04:01.342 --> 04:04.011
so now I'm starting my 16th
year in some New York hospital

04:04.044 --> 04:06.013
babysitting Finland while
he gets a French fry removed

04:06.046 --> 04:07.315
from his sinus passages.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.215
Well, how long are you in town?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.017
Maybe I can take you
to lunch tomorrow.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.785
Barney's! A belated celebration!

04:11.819 --> 04:13.020
Happy birthday!

04:13.053 --> 04:15.022
Don't pretend
that you care about me.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.024
You don't care
about any of us.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.426
I do care.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.428
Really? Is that
why you told

04:20.461 --> 04:22.730
everyone you were leaving
forever in an e-mail?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.398
You know what?

04:24.432 --> 04:26.400
Good-bye, Dr. Hart.
See you never.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.369
Rose, come...

04:28.402 --> 04:29.537
(sighs)

04:34.575 --> 04:36.344
Individual e-mails.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.546
Minimal cutting and pasting.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.781
(sighs)

04:40.814 --> 04:45.052
You know, it's just... it's so
hard for me to say good-bye.

04:45.085 --> 04:49.457
Zoe, I know you've been having
weird dreams, anxiety.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.360
Maybe you should go back
to BlueBell.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.062
Tie up loose ends,
make things right.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.798
Get that very important
reference letter signed.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.769
Joel, things in BlueBell
are... complicated.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.672
There's stuff that I haven't
fully told you.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.540
Yeah, and I want
to know everything.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.376
But we have time.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.543
You know,

05:09.577 --> 05:10.811
maybe before we start
our new life,

05:10.844 --> 05:12.680
you should put the old one
to bed.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.782
(sighs)

05:19.487 --> 05:22.456
Yeah. Maybe
you're right.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.458
Go.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.693
Enjoy yourself.
Take a few days.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.396
Just be back
Friday morning by 9:00.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.830
Of course.
Mm.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.898
Pinky promise.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.433
Mm, pinky promise.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.634
(both chuckle)

05:34.602 --> 05:36.604
*

06:05.165 --> 06:07.367
Hello?!

06:09.470 --> 06:11.439
Where'd everyone go?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.541
WADE:
They're in the church.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.742
Town meeting.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.846
Hello, Doc.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.782
Hi, Wade.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.584
It's nice to see you.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.586
Figured you'd be back.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.798
Actually, um, I'm-I'm just here
for the night, so...

06:38.799 --> 06:40.968
Well, I'm guessing I'm...

06:41.001 --> 06:43.904
probably not the first person
you were hoping to run into.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.574
I just...

06:46.607 --> 06:48.909
I know that-that you...

06:48.942 --> 06:51.912
are probably angry at me,
and-and I should explain.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.781
No.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.415
No need to explain.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.520
I don't have any regrets.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.791
As for the rest of the people
in this town, I can't say

07:03.824 --> 07:05.793
they were as charmed
by your cyber adioses as I was.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.597
Well, that's why I'm here:
to smooth all that over.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.633
Good luck with that, Doc.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.709
(sighs)

07:23.744 --> 07:25.613
Unfortunately, it is true.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.215
Fillmore has issued a preemptive
noise ordinance against us.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.382
(crowd groaning)
(clears throat)

07:29.416 --> 07:32.553
Now, now, unless we can get it
overturned by tomorrow,

07:32.586 --> 07:34.722
the Founder's Day parade
is canceled.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.657
(crowd murmuring, groaning)
Say what?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.693
Mayor Hayes, now, this parade
has been going on now

07:39.727 --> 07:41.228
for 250 years.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.362
How could this be?

07:42.395 --> 07:44.965
Mayor Todd Gainey Sr. and
that crooked ambulance chaser,

07:44.998 --> 07:46.233
Scooter McGreevey, is how.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.501
JEFFRIES:
I was gonna take a date,

07:47.535 --> 07:49.637
and she was hot to trot.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.872
If George Tucker were here,
this never would have happened.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.841
Look, look, everybody
just calm down.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.511
Huh? Reverend,
I'm-I'm sure you have

07:57.545 --> 07:59.479
some words of wisdom.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.650
We could pray.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.251
Let us bow our heads

08:04.284 --> 08:05.886
in a moment
of silent reflection.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.891
(door creaks open)

08:14.995 --> 08:16.564
Hello, everyone!

08:16.597 --> 08:17.631
I'm back!

08:17.665 --> 08:20.634
(cricket chirping)

08:21.802 --> 08:24.905
I brought bagels.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.575
(car horn honks)

08:27.608 --> 08:29.677
(seagulls calling)

08:29.710 --> 08:31.779
(birds singing)

08:41.755 --> 08:42.856
Lavon.
(chuckles)

08:42.890 --> 08:44.725
Please tell me
that you don't hate me.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.293
What? What? No. Never.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.928
(grunts, chuckles)

08:47.961 --> 08:49.663
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

08:49.697 --> 08:51.031
It was all just
kind of last minute.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.299
I've been thinking
about this place,

08:52.332 --> 08:53.834
and-and I wanted
to end things right.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.103
Plus, I need Brick to sign
this reference letter.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.906
So you're really staying
in New York, huh?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.841
I mean, you know, uh,

09:00.874 --> 09:01.875
I got your e-mail,

09:01.909 --> 09:03.844
but somehow I didn't think
it was gonna stick.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.945
I know.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.947
I'm sorry about the e-mail.
I-I should have called.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.716
But, come on,
let's face it.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.950
You know, BlueBell was like

09:09.983 --> 09:12.319
just a rest stop
on the way to reality.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.320
(chuckles)

09:13.353 --> 09:15.055
I met someone.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.725
Someone that I can see spending
the rest of my life with.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.859
(laughs) That's great news.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.628
I know things here were...

09:20.661 --> 09:22.863
Tumultuous? Trying? Triangular?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.364
All of the above.
(chuckles)

09:24.397 --> 09:26.333
I'm happy for you.
Thank you.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.602
Mayor Hayes, no big deal--
the town's going down in flames,

09:28.636 --> 09:31.571
but by all means, keep gossiping
like a beauty parlor lady.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.874
Sorry, Z, I got to go.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.175
I'm-I'm glad you're here.

09:36.877 --> 09:40.347
Um, yeah,
you-you should know, um,

09:40.380 --> 09:42.950
I sublet the carriage house
to my cousin Lynly.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.719
Oh. Yeah, no, I didn't expect...

09:45.753 --> 09:47.354
I'll just stay at the B&B.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.355
Okay. Bye.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.891
Bye.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.092
Dash.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.061
Guess what. I'm
gonna check in

09:54.094 --> 09:55.696
to the Whippoorwill Blossom,
so we are gonna have

09:55.729 --> 09:56.864
so much time to catch up.

09:56.897 --> 10:00.701
All of my rooms are filled up
with guests for the parade.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.102
And I wouldn't want you
to have one anyway.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.871
(scoffs)

10:03.904 --> 10:05.973
You know, in New York,

10:06.006 --> 10:10.010
a gesture of fresh bagels
means something!

10:11.411 --> 10:13.681
We need to discuss
our options for the parade

10:13.714 --> 10:15.115
in case we can't
make noise.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.884
So I say

10:16.917 --> 10:20.788
we all learn to sing "Dixie"
in sign language.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.855
(chuckles)
Where is Lemon?

10:21.889 --> 10:25.392
Outside, on the phone
with her secret boyfriend.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.761
Lemon doesn't have
a secret boyfriend.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.763
We'd know.
Really?

10:29.797 --> 10:32.399
She's on the phone
all the time, whispering.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.902
She's got a spring in her step.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.772
I am positive our little Lemon
is getting herself squeezed.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.007
(laughter)

10:40.040 --> 10:41.909
Hey, all you Belles!

10:41.942 --> 10:43.176
Zoe Hart.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.813
It is so good
to see you all again.

10:45.846 --> 10:46.914
You look just the same.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.415
Any of you have a spare room?

10:48.448 --> 10:49.416
Perchance a guesthouse?

10:49.449 --> 10:52.152
Welcome back,
but no one likes you anymore.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.153
Oh.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.421
You can stay with us.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.856
Ow. Ow.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.725
Oh, but Wanda feels

10:57.758 --> 10:58.926
your leaving was a
personal betrayal

10:58.959 --> 11:01.795
and has vowed never to let
you darken her doorstep again.

11:01.829 --> 11:05.032
And since I am married to her,
you can't stay with me.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.166
I retract.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.467
I don't get it.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.169
Why is everyone this mad?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.438
I moved. People are allowed
to move, right?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.639
Yeah.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.776
Uh, I think it might be because
you ruined all our lives.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.845
That is most certainly
the reason.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.946
Wait. I did what?!

11:18.979 --> 11:21.048
See, when you told George Tucker

11:21.081 --> 11:24.051
that you loved him,
it chased Tansy out of town.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.454
And, uh, sad George went on the
road with Lily Ann Lonnergan.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.956
No one's heard
from him since.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.090
He's MIA.
What?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.059
Oh. Missing In Action.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.763
Anyway, uh, just to mess
with us, Scooter McGreevy

11:35.796 --> 11:37.230
took advantage
of George's absence

11:37.264 --> 11:39.833
and had the people of Fillmore
sue half this town.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.069
Lavon had to pull
our old town lawyer,

11:42.102 --> 11:43.737
Old Man Bryant,
out of retirement.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.072
And he keeps falling asleep
in court.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.942
Anyway, it was nice to see you.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.311
I mean, screw
you, Zoe Hart!

11:52.512 --> 11:54.815
(door bells jingle)

11:57.851 --> 12:00.253
Okay, this cannot happen again.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.489
It has all just been
a dreadful mistake.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.524
I-I mean, I'm just...
I'm not seeing clearly

12:04.557 --> 12:06.960
due to the stress
of the Founder's Day debacle.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.799
Yes, yes, yes, you are
a very good stress relief.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.102
Which is why... I'm just not
gonna get stressed anymore.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.004
Okay? Good-bye.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.039
(sighs)

12:22.275 --> 12:23.944
Please tell me

12:23.977 --> 12:26.780
that you are the identical
twin cousin of Zoe Hart,

12:26.814 --> 12:28.982
and not the Zoe Hart I've
been assured is not returning.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.918
Oh, I'm not returning.
I'm just visiting.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.820
And please, for
the love of God,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.922
tell me that you are no longer
involved with my cousin.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
Oh, no. Jonah and I had brief...

12:36.990 --> 12:38.926
But it is long, long over.
Very over.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.795
Good. Well, then I
continue to hate you.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.964
And here I was afraid
that everything had changed.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.066
Nice to see you, Lemon.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.935
(sighs)

12:47.968 --> 12:50.037
Meet me in my place in an hour.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.040
BRICK:
 Old Man Bryant, get up!

12:53.073 --> 12:55.542
Come on, get up,
you stubborn old coot. Get up!

12:55.575 --> 12:57.277
Oh, where am I?

12:57.310 --> 12:58.946
Who are you?
Yeah.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.547
Yeah, I was
just gonna...

13:00.580 --> 13:01.514
(snoring)

13:01.548 --> 13:04.885
Oh, please, please
let my eyes be deceiving me.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.054
Let this be
a stroke and not...

13:07.087 --> 13:08.221
Brick Breeland,
you look great!

13:08.255 --> 13:09.890
Have you been
working out?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.025
Not you. You... you are
supposed to be gone.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.961
This-this practice
is mine now.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.863
I have the e-mail
to prove it.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.830
Of course it is.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.166
I am just here to visit,
to see how you are.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.300
How's Magnolia?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.169
How's the old
golf game, huh?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.837
Did you get
that reference letter I sent?

13:23.871 --> 13:26.073
I do not sign my name
to false statements, young lady.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.976
And you most certainly were not
a role model to this community.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.178
And Founder's Day used
to be my favorite holiday!

13:31.211 --> 13:33.080
Brick, come on,
I really need this.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.882
No.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.616
Your-your narcolepsy patient--
I can help.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.886
The sleep clinic at
my hospital-- they've done some

13:38.919 --> 13:40.988
groundbreaking
stu...
No! Come on, one foot

13:41.021 --> 13:42.089
in front of the other.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.191
You, go.
Go, go, go! Shoo!

13:44.224 --> 13:45.592
Come on, Brick.
Come on.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.994
ANNABETH:
I wouldn't take anything

13:47.027 --> 13:48.195
he says personally.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.597
A.B.! You work here now?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.965
Give me some sugar, Zoe.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.300
And you don't hate me?
(laughs)

13:53.333 --> 13:55.068
BRICK:
Wake up old man!

13:55.102 --> 13:56.003
(door slams)
Ooh!

13:56.036 --> 13:58.205
Brick seems crabbier
and meaner than usual.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.339
Been like this for months.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.208
He and Shelby were gonna elope,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.043
but he broke up
with her instead,

14:03.076 --> 14:04.211
which he obviously regrets.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.613
His moping
made Magnolia so crazy

14:06.646 --> 14:09.016
that Lemon convinced him
to send her to boarding school.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.019
So, I stepped in to stop him
from killing the patients.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
It was the Christian
thing to do.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.255
But you and Lavon--
you guys are still good?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.390
We are. His cousin...

14:17.424 --> 14:18.926
(door opens)
Lynly!

14:18.959 --> 14:20.360
AnnaBeth!
You look beautiful.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.930
Oh, h-have you met Zoe Hart?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.231
I've heard so much

14:24.264 --> 14:26.233
about you, and
love you already.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.102
Thanks for all the remodeling
you did to the carriage house.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
It's to die.
Thanks.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.940
Anyways, AnnaBeth,
huge-normous news.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.641
I'm gluten free now!

14:34.674 --> 14:38.078
Oh. I was gonna make
a lasagna tonight.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.113
My favorite!
You're so sweet.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.481
Just do that
gluten free.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.252
Thanks! Coffee soon?

14:45.285 --> 14:46.186
That's Little Lynly?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.655
The only thing little
about her anymore

14:48.688 --> 14:50.123
is her regard for my time.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.025
(door opens, Brick groans)
I'll see you.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.994
(snoring continues)

14:54.027 --> 14:57.030
Hey, Brick, looks like your
patient's still asleep.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.966
Not gonna be so
helpful in court.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.000
All, right, fine, big shot.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.170
You go ahead, you work
your New York doctor magic.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.072
Thank you, sir, for
the opportunity.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.679
Terrible news.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.214
Brace yourself.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.282
Zoe Hart is back.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.250
Well, don't blow
a gasket, Lemon.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.285
She leaves town tomorrow.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.388
Well, it's not my gasket
that I'm worried about.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.090
Are you okay?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.092
Yeah.
Wait.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.960
You don't have to
pretend with me.

15:26.994 --> 15:30.097
I'm the only one who knows what
you said to Zoe before she left,

15:30.130 --> 15:31.031
and I'm the only
one who knows

15:31.064 --> 15:33.000
what her little e-mail
did to your heart.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.068
Lemon, I am fine,
all right? Fine.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.305
Don't look so... worried.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.977
(snoring)

15:44.011 --> 15:45.712
(snapping fingers)

15:45.745 --> 15:48.015
Oh, snapping your fingers.
How innovative.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.118
Wow, the wonders
of modern medicine. Hold on.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.720
I want... I want to record this
for the medical journals.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.456
Okay, maybe I don't know any
new techniques for narcolepsy.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.092
Uh-huh.
What can I do to
make this better?

15:59.126 --> 16:01.328
I-I will do anything.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.030
You find George Tucker,

16:03.063 --> 16:05.332
you get him to that hearing
at 3:00 tomorrow,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.434
and-and I will sign
your-your blessed letter.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.337
A challenge. I accept.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.438
Consider George found.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.241
I know people
who know people.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.443
(snorting)

16:18.511 --> 16:22.249
ZOE:
 My mother is nothing
 but a disappointment.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.351
No, she wouldn't call
the NSA for me.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.319
I just wanted
to know all the people

16:26.353 --> 16:28.155
George Tucker had called
and e-mailed.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.090
Yeah, but don't worry, Joel.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.760
I am going to stay up all night
brainstorming ways to find him.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.228
(TV playing loudly)

16:35.262 --> 16:37.297
But first, I have to get
these stupid neighbors

16:37.330 --> 16:40.367
to turn down their stupid
television so I can concentrate!

16:40.400 --> 16:42.769
Okay, look, I love you.
I got to go.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.404
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.209
Turn that down!

16:49.242 --> 16:50.510
(TV continues playing loudly)

16:50.543 --> 16:52.145
Ugh!

16:58.518 --> 17:01.254
(TV playing loudly)

17:01.288 --> 17:04.022
I said, turn that down!

17:07.194 --> 17:09.061
George?

17:13.333 --> 17:17.304
Wow. I'm really good
at finding people.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.182
Of course you'll think of
some way to save that parade.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.417
You're Lavon Hayes.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.584
You can do anything.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.852
(chuckles):
Oh.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.589
And you are the sweetest little
cousin in the whole wide world.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.262
What is this?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.331
Gluten-free blueberry muffins.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.465
Why?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.435
Morning, y'all.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.569
Hi, Wade!

17:49.602 --> 17:51.304
I like your shirt.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.572
Thank you.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.574
It's, uh...
it's an oldie, but a goodie.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.376
Wade. (clears throat)
A word?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.312
Yeah.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.149
Little Lynly is nursing
a broken heart.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.351
Now, if you so much
as flirt with her,

18:04.384 --> 18:07.187
I will remove
your arms, your legs,

18:07.220 --> 18:10.557
and you will have a hard time
relieving yourself.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.360
You're adorable, Papa Bear,
but no worries, all right?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.861
I'm doing fine
with the ladies,

18:14.894 --> 18:17.430
so no need to seduce
the ones I live with.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.232
Got me in enough
trouble before.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.867
Oh. Yeah.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.202
Yeah.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.204
All right.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.473
(coughs)

18:26.506 --> 18:28.908
What is this?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.911
Those muffins
really are terrible.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.215
Well, yes, they are made
without flour.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.650
And that lasagna last night--
whew, that was a stinker, too.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.918
(laughs)

18:38.951 --> 18:40.620
You try making
noodles out of kale.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.289
Sweetheart,
don't get so defensive.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.624
Not everyone is a natural
in the kitchen.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.926
I used to have
my own catering company!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.361
She is so cute!

18:48.395 --> 18:49.629
Yeah, I know, huh?

18:51.598 --> 18:52.665
Hey.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.634
Why did I know
you couldn't stay away?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.902
I need a favor.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.372
Oh, Doc, you know,
I know you're on your vacay,

18:59.406 --> 19:00.507
but you should know.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.343
See, this--
it's not gonna happen.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.577
That ship has sailed, sister.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.214
Yeah, SS Wade Kinsella
has left port.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.215
Accept it.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.417
Okay, I need a favor.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.285
Lemon?
No.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.653
Lemon, I found
George Tucker,

19:13.686 --> 19:15.655
I tried to talk
to him all night,

19:15.688 --> 19:18.358
but he will not let me
into his motel room.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.327
That is because
you are the devil,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.395
and George Tucker
is smart enough to know that.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.431
Now, where is he?

19:30.570 --> 19:32.405
(sighs)

19:32.439 --> 19:33.573
Up, up, up.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.675
You need to save
Founder's Day in four hours,

19:35.708 --> 19:38.245
and, right now,
you look like Joaquin Phoenix.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.349
Lemon, go away.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.950
I'm not going
to court, okay?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.353
I'm not up to it.
I'm not up to anything.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.954
Oh, really, how bad
can things be?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.589
Bad.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.559
Like, bad, like so...

19:52.592 --> 19:54.294
so bad. Hey!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.662
(sighs)

19:55.695 --> 19:57.697
Worse than when you lost
your first trial?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.667
Worse than your dad's
50th birthday party?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.769
Go away.
Tell me.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.505
I mean, you went on tour
with Lily Ann Lonnergan.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.507
I mean, that must have
been fun, right?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.476
And that song
that you wrote about Zoe Hart

20:09.509 --> 20:11.578
was, like, a bit of a hit
on local radio.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.313
I mean, it was...
it was catchy.

20:13.346 --> 20:16.283
George?

20:16.316 --> 20:18.318
Talk.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.021
Okay, fine.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.723
Yeah, being on
the road was...

20:23.756 --> 20:25.592
It was fun for
a little while,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.460
but about a month
ago, I realized

20:27.494 --> 20:29.028
that I was...
I was done.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.797
Okay, I wanted to go
back to BlueBell,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.999
and I wanted to
settle down.

20:33.032 --> 20:36.002
And I realized that I
wanted to do it with Tansy.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.136
No offense.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.307
Uh, I think it's safe to say
that we've moved past that.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.509
But, apparently, she'd heard
that little hit song of mine,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.512
which was based solely on all
the pain that Zoe had caused me,

20:45.545 --> 20:47.814
which did nothing but...

20:47.847 --> 20:49.582
confirm Tansy's suspicions.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.419
And... well,
instead of

20:52.452 --> 20:56.489
taking me into her arms,
she slapped me in the face.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.526
Okay, that is bad.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.061
But, George, you cannot
sit around in your pajamas

21:02.094 --> 21:03.763
watching television
for the rest of your life.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.333
Yeah, I can.
See, this show--

21:06.366 --> 21:08.501
this is called
 Don Todd's Monster Golf Safari.

21:08.535 --> 21:11.371
Don Todd coming to you
from the Big Island of Hawaii.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.640
Or as the locals pronounce it,
"Hawai'i."

21:13.673 --> 21:15.642
Every week,
he sinks a shot

21:15.675 --> 21:17.777
from one of the world's
most dangerous locations.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.346
Just this morning,

21:19.379 --> 21:22.549
he sunk a putt from the top
of an active volcano.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.717
I actually really
like this show.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.587
While that does sound
fascinating... (chuckles)

21:27.620 --> 21:30.557
George, what you love
is the law.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.659
And what you love
is BlueBell.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.061
Eh. I'm over 'em.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.063
Both of 'em.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.665
Okay, George...

21:38.698 --> 21:40.333
I know you.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.668
And you know me.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.803
So what is secretly
my favorite movie?

21:45.838 --> 21:48.675
Any movie
with a training montage.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.710
*

22:17.637 --> 22:19.639
*

22:24.644 --> 22:27.614
TOM:
 Here comes another update
 on Dash's blog!

22:27.647 --> 22:29.516
George looks
really confident.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.117
The prosecution
looks nervous.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.652
Dash says
George is killing it!

22:32.685 --> 22:34.120
(crowd cheering)

22:34.153 --> 22:37.590
He just finished
his closing arguments.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.558
George says...

22:38.591 --> 22:39.826
ZOE:
Hey, Shula.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.827
Oh, Zoe.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.861
I hope you're being careful

22:41.894 --> 22:43.162
picking up
Mr. Whiskers.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.664
You don't want to throw
out your back again.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.934
Well, actually, I put
Mr. Whiskers on a diet.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.736
You want to see a picture?

22:49.769 --> 22:51.571
Of course I do.
Okay.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.139
You just stay away
from my patients,

22:53.172 --> 22:54.574
or I'll get
a restraining order.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.575
ROSE:
Don't you yell at her.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.843
George is winning
in court,

22:56.876 --> 22:58.745
and she's the one who found him.

22:58.778 --> 22:59.846
What?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.449
We won!

23:02.482 --> 23:04.150
The parade's back on!

23:04.183 --> 23:06.853
(crowd cheering)

23:06.886 --> 23:08.621
Oh, you saved the parade!

23:08.655 --> 23:10.690
Well, no. Not technically.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.891
Oh, thank you, Zoe.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.760
Next haircut's on me.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.762
(chuckles)
Thank you!

23:15.795 --> 23:19.866
If Tom and I get alpacas,
I'm naming one after you.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.468
Sorry about before.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.902
I just... missed you.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.437
I missed you, too, Wanda.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.905
I missed
all of you guys a lot,

23:25.938 --> 23:27.674
and I promise that
I will be better

23:27.707 --> 23:28.941
about staying in touch.

23:28.975 --> 23:29.776
Quit milking it.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.778
I will sign
that co-op board letter.

23:31.811 --> 23:32.779
Now, come on.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.582
Oh. Thanks.

23:38.818 --> 23:42.589
Joel, I can assure you
I'm not gonna miss my flight.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.724
The-the airport is the size
of a living room.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.992
Security-- it's no big deal.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.594
I promise, I'm not gonna...

23:47.627 --> 23:49.195
Hey, pretty doctor,
I cut my finger

23:49.228 --> 23:50.830
the other day, and I got
this thing on my arm.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.199
I-I'll call you
from the plane, okay?

23:53.232 --> 23:54.200
All right, bye.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.202
Right.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.704
Earl, I'm not gonna fall
for Wade's attempt

23:57.737 --> 23:59.506
to get me to miss
my flight back home.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.673
You don't live here anymore?

24:00.707 --> 24:02.709
Didn't Wade tell you
that I left?

24:02.742 --> 24:03.643
No.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.512
You should see Dr. Breeland.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.515
I'd rather cut my arm off than
see that jerk Brick Breeland.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.483
Anyhow, pretty doctor,
you're family.

24:11.518 --> 24:12.985
Show me.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.861
(sighs):
Oh, Earl.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.732
(exhales)

24:25.765 --> 24:26.833
(clears throat)

24:26.866 --> 24:28.735
Hey, something's come up.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.571
I'm not gonna make that flight.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.605
(sighs)

24:43.282 --> 24:45.017
Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

24:45.051 --> 24:46.986
What's the, uh,
big "emergency"?

24:47.019 --> 24:48.020
Your dad's here.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.991
Hi, son.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.993
Come to see your girlfriend?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.662
He has blood poisoning.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.864
It's headed up his arm
towards his heart.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.065
I've already given him
a shot of antibiotics,

24:59.098 --> 25:00.667
but we need to get him
to the hospital.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.869
Negative. I do not go
to hospitals.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.704
No way, Josita.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.706
Dad, don't be an idiot.
Come on. Let's go.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.940
You go.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.676
Pick me up some Jell-O.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.778
Earl, this is serious. If that
poison reaches your heart...

25:11.811 --> 25:13.880
I would rather die here
with my son

25:13.913 --> 25:16.883
and my future daughter-in-law
by my side.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.018
You can plan your wedding
to coincide with my funeral.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.086
(sighs)

25:20.119 --> 25:22.088
Fine.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.558
The poison...

25:25.592 --> 25:27.293
is here.

25:27.326 --> 25:30.029
I need to monitor it for
the next eight hours,

25:30.062 --> 25:31.898
every 20 minutes,
to make sure it doesn't rise.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.600
You go. I got it.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.001
Uh...

25:35.034 --> 25:39.839
my boy would never abandon me
at a time like this.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.743
Looks like we're gonna be
pulling an all-nighter.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.778
Think of all the catching up
we can do.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.747
We'll take shifts.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.617
I'll monitor him first.
You go sleep.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.920
Doc, it's 9:15.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.655
Then go for a walk.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.090
(sighs)

26:02.862 --> 26:04.931
Damn! Again?

26:04.964 --> 26:06.065
Hey!
(chuckles)

26:06.098 --> 26:08.701
Lemon, let me help.
Oh, thanks.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.703
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing
here so late?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.740
(groans) Avoiding Lynly.
She's driving me up a wall.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.642
Lavon and I can never...

26:15.675 --> 26:18.044
Uh, I shouldn't
be complaining.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.079
Oh, no, it's fine.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.849
Lemon, listen, um...

26:22.882 --> 26:25.885
is it just me
or are things a little...

26:25.918 --> 26:27.086
weird between us?

26:27.119 --> 26:30.690
Weird? No, things are not weird.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.692
Yes, they are.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.360
(quietly): Everyone knows
you're sleeping with someone,

26:34.393 --> 26:36.362
and everyone expects
that I know who it is.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.664
And I don't!
Your best friend!

26:37.697 --> 26:39.732
(quietly):
Oh, shh! Okay. Fine.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.100
I am sleeping with someone.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.369
But I can't tell you who
because...

26:43.402 --> 26:44.771
it is shameful.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.039
Well, if it's so shameful,

26:47.073 --> 26:49.776
maybe you should stop
sleeping with him.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.043
It is a him, right?

26:51.077 --> 26:52.611
(chuckles)

26:53.412 --> 26:55.882
I'll see you later.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.917
(sighs)

27:03.890 --> 27:07.426
Gosh, Meatball, watch
where you're going!

27:07.459 --> 27:08.895
(sighs)

27:08.928 --> 27:10.930
Meet me at my
place in an hour.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.137
Yeah, guys, I'm gonna have
to skip bowling tonight.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.973
Really, Meat, again?
Weak.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.948
(birds chirping)

27:36.188 --> 27:37.757
Hey.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.792
Hey.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.897
(sighing)

27:44.931 --> 27:47.099
The line's receded.
He's gonna be fine.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.135
(grunts)

27:49.168 --> 27:51.203
I'll, uh...
I'll take him home.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.040
Come here.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.849
Look, Wade, I feel like
I owe you an explanation.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.483
Honestly,
after all this time, Doc,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.118
I mean, what's the point, right?

28:06.152 --> 28:09.121
What you said to me before
I left, it meant something.

28:09.155 --> 28:12.759
And I thought about it a lot
when I first got there.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.194
But then it's like real life
just took over.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.462
"Real life"?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.865
Yeah, being back in New York,

28:18.898 --> 28:21.233
it-it reminded me of who I was.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.770
You know, who I've always been.

28:23.803 --> 28:27.006
Things, they're just
easier there.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.076
It doesn't mean
that it's not nice to see you.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.078
Doc, it's all good.
You know, I just...

28:32.111 --> 28:34.847
wish you good luck
in New York and...

28:34.881 --> 28:36.849
you know,
with the rest of your life.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.184
I hope you're happy.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.753
I hope you're happy, too.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.689
(door opens, Brick groans)

28:43.722 --> 28:48.127
I knew you just couldn't keep
your nose out of my business.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.897
Uh, Brick, it's-it's 6:00 a.m.
What are you doing here?

28:50.930 --> 28:52.765
Well, I found your friend
wandering around the street.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.201
And I said, "You know,
I know the one place

28:55.234 --> 28:57.503
where she is not allowed to be
is in my doctor's office."

28:57.536 --> 28:59.005
And that's why
I brought him here first.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.940
What? I'm sorry.
Brought-brought who here?

29:01.974 --> 29:03.810
(chuckles):
Hey.
Joel!

29:03.843 --> 29:05.011
JOEL:
Sorry.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.914
Hi. Hi.
Hi.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.817
(chuckles):
Oh, my God! Wow!

29:10.850 --> 29:12.952
Th-That's Brick. You met Brick.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.887
Mm-hmm.
This... That's Wade.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.523
He used to be my neighbor.
Oh.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.524
(chuckles)

29:18.557 --> 29:20.026
Hey, pal. How you doing?

29:20.059 --> 29:22.061
How are you? Good.
Good. Yeah.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.997
Wow, uh, this place is trippier
than I ever imagined.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.098
It is 6:00 a.m.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.968
Are you aware that there are
ladies in period costume

29:29.001 --> 29:30.536
waltzing around town square?

29:30.569 --> 29:31.971
(Zoe and Joel chuckle)

29:32.004 --> 29:34.006
Hi.
Hi.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.283
I'm-I'm so sorry
that I missed the co-op meeting.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.853
Are you sure you're not mad
about losing the apartment?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.288
Eh, we'll find
another place.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.959
It is just both so surreal
and so amazing

29:52.992 --> 29:54.961
that you are here in Alabama.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.863
Well, how could I
miss Founder's Day?

29:56.896 --> 29:58.297
(laughs)
Hello.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.867
Rose is so happy.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.869
Thank you.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.371
And thank you
for being here.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.041
So, um... why don't you tell
me about Founder's Day.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.310
'Cause it sounds
kind of dirty.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.846
Oh. Yeah. It definitely is.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.847
Oh.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.182
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.317
A long, long time ago...

30:18.350 --> 30:19.318
Okay.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.320
...a rugged pioneer named...

30:21.353 --> 30:22.321
Mmm.

30:22.354 --> 30:26.325
Cyrus... Lavinius...

30:26.358 --> 30:28.427
Jeremiah...
Mm-hmm.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.830
...Jones...

30:36.135 --> 30:38.004
BRICK:
Thank you.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.940
Hey, Lemonade!
Oh, hi, Daddy.

30:40.973 --> 30:44.243
Sugar, I think you got
your dress on inside out.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.345
Are you okay?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.280
(sighs)

30:48.314 --> 30:50.116
No.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.019
Hi, Lynly.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.353
Um, where's Lavon?

30:54.386 --> 30:55.922
Went to set up for the parade.

30:55.955 --> 30:56.923
Oh.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.024
I'll just meet him there.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.959
I'm glad you're here.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.428
I've decided to give up
all food with food dye,

31:02.461 --> 31:04.897
and I need to go
through Lavon's pantry and...

31:04.931 --> 31:08.100
Lynly, I was thinking
we could talk,

31:08.134 --> 31:10.102
you know, about your
plans. (chuckles)

31:10.136 --> 31:12.238
Are you planning on leaving
anytime soon?

31:12.271 --> 31:15.174
Oh, my God, you're trying
to get rid of me, aren't you?

31:15.207 --> 31:18.044
No! I was just wondering...

31:18.077 --> 31:19.311
I can't believe this.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.980
You're just like my parents,

31:21.013 --> 31:22.648
just like
my ex-boyfriend.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.184
What is wrong with me?
Why does everyone hate me?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.660
Tansy?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.662
George.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.298
I thought... I heard you
weren't back in town.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.067
I wouldn't have...
Oh, no, it's fine.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.203
It's-it's great,
actually. Um...

31:44.236 --> 31:45.404
How are you?

31:45.437 --> 31:48.107
Good. Really good.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.976
Good. Good.
Are you in town for the parade?

31:50.009 --> 31:51.277
'Cause, I mean, if you are,

31:51.310 --> 31:53.145
maybe we could go get a...
a cup of coffee?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.147
Oh. You should know.

31:55.181 --> 31:58.050
George, I'm with someone.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.186
Actually, I think
you might know him.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.321
Who?

32:02.354 --> 32:04.490
Scott... Scooter McGreevy.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.160
As in...

32:08.194 --> 32:10.196
as in, Fillmore's attorney?

32:10.229 --> 32:14.100
As in, the man
with 48 active lawsuits

32:14.133 --> 32:15.701
against the town
of BlueBell?

32:15.734 --> 32:17.703
That Scooter McGreevy?

32:17.736 --> 32:19.371
Tansy, no.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.706
(laughs)

32:20.739 --> 32:22.174
I mean, just... no.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.309
(laughs)

32:23.342 --> 32:25.211
You take care, George.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.717
What's the matter, sunshine?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.719
Want to know?

32:33.752 --> 32:36.255
'Cause I have to tell someone,
or I'm gonna explode.

32:37.489 --> 32:40.726
I can't stop having sex
with Meatball.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.529
With Meatball, or a meatball?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.464
'Cause I don't know
which is worse.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.133
I wanted
to find a suitable mate,

32:47.166 --> 32:50.236
and I spent the whole summer
searching, and then I just fell

32:50.269 --> 32:51.237
into his meaty...

32:51.270 --> 32:52.338
No! Stop, please!

32:52.371 --> 32:53.472
This is not

32:53.505 --> 32:54.740
how I foresaw my life.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.909
Yeah, well,
join the club, sister.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.349
(clears throat)
Zoe's got a boyfriend.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.751
Seems like
a decent enough guy.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.486
No.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.488
Zoe Hart does
not get to have

33:09.521 --> 33:11.490
a real boyfriend
when I am sleeping with someone

33:11.523 --> 33:13.325
named after his resemblance
to a side order.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.161
She does not get
to break your heart

33:15.194 --> 33:16.495
and then waltz off
into the sunset.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.497
Lemon, it's not a big deal,
all right?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.199
She's gonna be gone by tonight.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.405
Uh-oh.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.277
(hammering, crowd chattering)

33:31.310 --> 33:33.179
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

33:33.212 --> 33:34.380
Are you kidding me?

33:34.413 --> 33:35.514
I'm so excited for this!

33:35.547 --> 33:37.383
Okay, well,
go find a good spot--

33:37.416 --> 33:39.785
not next to Frank-- and be sure
to use your bug spray.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.420
All right. (chuckles)

33:44.423 --> 33:46.258
Hey.
Hi.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.094
I heard you were
leaving today.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.096
I just want to say,
no hard feelings.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.397
I wish you well.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.233
Was that your
new boyfriend?

33:54.266 --> 33:55.434
Oh, yeah. His name is Joel.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.369
Oh. (laughs)
That's a relief.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.538
Makes the whole thing
that much less awkward.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.207
What whole thing?
You know.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.175
That Wade has
a new girlfriend, too.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.477
Well, it's been five months.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.414
Of course Wade was gonna
go back to being Wade.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.217
No, he's not with another bimbo,
if that's what you're implying.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.551
He hasn't just been
mooning around,

34:12.583 --> 34:14.219
waiting for you
to come back.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.322
He's with
someone real,

34:16.355 --> 34:18.824
someone... wonderful.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.592
In BlueBell?

34:20.626 --> 34:22.328
Seriously? Who?

34:22.360 --> 34:23.562
Me!

34:23.594 --> 34:24.830
(laughs)

34:24.862 --> 34:26.165
That's right.

34:26.197 --> 34:30.202
Wade Kinsella and I
are... in love.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.471
Well, have a safe trip back.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.505
Mm-hmm.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.480
(scoffs)

34:47.219 --> 34:49.221
(crowd cheering,
band playing upbeat march)

35:02.534 --> 35:05.204
You have to admit,
this is fun.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.553
Here you go, Francesca.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.422
All right.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.258
Okay, you don't have
to thank me,

35:26.292 --> 35:27.626
but thanks to me, you won.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.196
Ooh, I won? What did I win?

35:30.229 --> 35:31.297
You won the breakup contest.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.332
I told Zoe Hart
that you have

35:33.365 --> 35:35.501
an amazing new girlfriend-- me!

35:35.534 --> 35:36.435
Please tell me you didn't.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.437
Oh, I did. Now,
she'll go home thinking

35:38.470 --> 35:40.239
that you moved on
more than she has.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.173
You're welcome!

35:41.207 --> 35:46.578
Lemon Breeland,
you are certifiably insane.

35:46.612 --> 35:50.249
You need a 12-step program
for shenanigans addicts.

35:50.282 --> 35:53.219
But I appreciate
the thought, all right?

35:53.252 --> 35:54.420
(laughs)

35:54.453 --> 35:56.455
(crowd chattering)

36:00.959 --> 36:02.361
Popcorn!

36:07.466 --> 36:10.269
WOMAN:
Hi, Dr. Hart!

36:19.311 --> 36:20.546
So, I guess this is it.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.449
Well...

36:23.482 --> 36:26.652
I just want to posit one thing.

36:26.685 --> 36:31.757
Now, what if BlueBell is real,
and New York is the rest stop?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.359
Lavon.
Well, now, now.

36:33.392 --> 36:36.462
You can't deny these
last two years have changed you,

36:36.495 --> 36:38.597
affected you.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.267
You met Lavon Hayes,
best friend you ever had.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.501
Nah.
Oh!

36:42.534 --> 36:46.572
Look, I-I know things got hard.

36:46.605 --> 36:50.276
But you can't move away forever
just because New York is easier.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.379
No, you-you should only
move away forever

36:53.412 --> 36:55.681
if... if you're still
a New Yorker.

36:55.714 --> 36:59.485
Well, I am...
still a New Yorker.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.721
You know, the first time
you rode on that float,

37:02.754 --> 37:06.725
you were like a fish
out of water, but today...

37:06.758 --> 37:08.627
(laughs)

37:08.660 --> 37:12.364
Zoe Hart, today,
you swam with the best of us.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.999
WALLY:
Hey, girl, where you been?

37:14.032 --> 37:15.301
Ooh, look at you!

37:15.334 --> 37:16.702
You look better than a month

37:16.735 --> 37:18.270
full of Sunday.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.339
Oh...
I'm telling you.
Look at you.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.340
I-I wanted to call you anyway.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.642
You know, my sugar's up,
but my pressure's down.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.311
You been good?

37:25.344 --> 37:26.478
Yeah, how your people doing?

37:26.512 --> 37:28.013
Look at you.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.348
Where you get them
shoes at, girl?

37:29.381 --> 37:30.316
I know you ain't
get them in BlueBell.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.584
Them ain't BlueBell shoes.
Them someplace else.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.421
You got another pair
in size 15?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.725
(door closes)

37:39.758 --> 37:43.028
Hey. Whoa, was that
parade amazing?!

37:43.061 --> 37:45.431
You totally didn't
do it justice.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.666
That was pretty great, huh?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.335
Except, I'm-I'm covered
in mosquito bites,

37:49.368 --> 37:51.337
and my legs are chafed
from the humidity.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.704
And that guy
at the store--

37:52.738 --> 37:55.641
he got so mad when I asked for
a copy of The New York Times.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.510
I mean, I cannot
wait to go home.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.512
Oh, you should probably
finish packing your stuff.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.349
I know we have, like, four hours
until the flight, but I...

38:03.382 --> 38:06.352
You know, I get neurotic about
airports, and, you know.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.489
(sighs)

38:10.522 --> 38:14.059
Joel, you know that
I love you, right?

38:14.092 --> 38:16.061
Yeah, of course I do.

38:16.094 --> 38:20.065
And I know that I promised you
a life in New York,

38:20.098 --> 38:22.668
but the thing is,
despite myself,

38:22.701 --> 38:26.572
this place,
with its stupid parades,

38:26.605 --> 38:29.508
and fried foods and mosquitoes--

38:29.541 --> 38:31.510
this place-- it's...

38:31.543 --> 38:33.612
it's where I belong.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.382
I know, I-I have been

38:36.415 --> 38:39.084
trying to fight it, but...

38:39.117 --> 38:41.620
somehow... it is.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.590
I know this is
so much to ask,

38:44.623 --> 38:47.559
and it is crazy stupid for me

38:47.593 --> 38:50.629
to even be asking you this,

38:50.662 --> 38:52.731
but you've always said that, um,

38:52.764 --> 38:56.668
you just need
a really good writing spot,

38:56.702 --> 39:00.639
and you could live... anywhere.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.579
Uh, excuse me.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.515
Can I get another
very large drink

39:09.548 --> 39:11.583
capable of erasing
two years of pain?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.619
Thank you.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.722
Can I join you?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.724
Uh... sure.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.427
Uh, but I-I must warn you,

39:21.460 --> 39:24.863
I may be a little drunk,
and terrible company.

39:24.896 --> 39:28.400
Um, what's your name?

39:28.434 --> 39:31.437
I don't want to exchange names,
or problems.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.472
Other people's problems
are so boring.

39:35.507 --> 39:38.477
I think we should take these
drinks back to your place.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.812
And hang out,

39:40.846 --> 39:42.814
and do some stuff.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.451
Some not-boring stuff.

39:51.557 --> 39:52.691
(tapping glass)

39:52.724 --> 39:54.693
Could I have everybody's
attention?

39:54.726 --> 39:55.794
(crowd chatter stops)

39:55.827 --> 39:57.529
Let's raise our glasses...

39:57.563 --> 39:59.665
to Cyrus Lavinius
Jeremiah Jones.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.968
ALL:
To Cyrus Lavinius
Jeremiah Jones!

40:09.207 --> 40:11.910
To all the citizens of BlueBell,

40:11.943 --> 40:13.912
Happy Founder's Day.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.947
(crowd cheering)

40:18.216 --> 40:20.185
(laughs)

40:20.218 --> 40:23.789
So, I see you're
not on your plane.

40:23.822 --> 40:24.923
I'm staying.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.525
(laughs)

40:26.558 --> 40:27.826
Oh, but not alone.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.929
Lavon, this is
my boyfriend, Joel.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.798
Welcome to our little town,
Joel.

40:32.831 --> 40:33.932
Oh, thanks, thanks.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.501
Yeah, I thought I'd
give BlueBell a try.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.803
You know, for this girl,
I'd live in New Jersey.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.605
Well, Metaphorical
New Jersey, to be clear.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.207
Not that this place is
anything like New Jersey.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.876
I just... You know,
I loved the parade.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.813
Why is she still here?

40:47.846 --> 40:50.215
(sighs)

40:50.248 --> 40:51.617
You know, I'm gonna get us
some beers.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.752
No, I'll do it.
Okay.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.755
What happened?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.824
Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

40:58.857 --> 41:01.827
I'm staying, and I know
that you knew that I would.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.596
Hmm. And, uh, Joel?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.766
He's staying, too.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.568
I hope that you can be okay
with it.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.236
But don't worry.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.971
Lemon told me
about you guys.

41:13.004 --> 41:16.875
And as weird as it is for me to
wrap my brain around the idea,

41:16.908 --> 41:18.777
I'm gonna try
to be okay with it, too.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.846
Look, Zoe, about Lemon...

41:20.879 --> 41:22.881
It's, um...

41:31.590 --> 41:33.559
Well...

41:33.592 --> 41:36.762
looks like we'll be living
happily ever after.

41:36.795 --> 41:37.863
(laughs)
Right, sweetie?

41:37.896 --> 41:39.598
Yes.
(laughs)

41:39.631 --> 41:41.933
Hey, hon, uh, is it all right
if we go back to the motel?

41:41.967 --> 41:44.770
All this fried food
is not sitting well.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.037
Yeah, let's get you to bed.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.039
All right.
All right.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.749
Zoe?

41:57.783 --> 42:00.018
