WEBVTT

00:11.912 --> 00:14.082
MAN : Car 27, we're
still waiting on you guys.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.349
Come on. Move your car back.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.750
CULLEN: Yeah, copy that.
Listen, it's just...

00:16.784 --> 00:19.187
Can I just say, we've already
moved back three times,

00:19.220 --> 00:20.821
and if we move back again,
we're gonna be

00:20.854 --> 00:22.690
the furthest car back
in the whole raid here.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.126
Uh, and don't forget,
we were the first car here.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.361
MAN: Detective Cullen,
I'm not gonna ask you again.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.197
Move your car further back.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.831
CULLEN: Okay, yeah, copy that.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.600
We're moving back.
We're moving back.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.714
Un-fucking-believable.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.350
We're so far back, we can't
even see the warehouse now.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.452
How many jurisdictions
are here?
Okay, look, just calm down.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.687
Let's roll the windows down
and get some fresh air in here.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.123
No, I don't need
fresh air, okay?

00:55.156 --> 00:58.326
I need to not be
constantly overlooked.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.161
We were here first.
Now we're so far back,

01:00.194 --> 01:01.295
we can't even see
the target location.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.530
Okay.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.733
Oh, hey.
Got something for you.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.171
Check it out.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.873
Mm, yeah, no.
That's not it. Wait.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.142
Ow, wait.
No, no.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.209
That doesn't help. No.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.144
I was gonna let you see it.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.146
I was just trying to get
the focus together.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.613
I don't need to look
at the warehouse

01:19.647 --> 01:21.582
through your novelty
telescope, okay?

01:21.615 --> 01:24.618
I need to be the closest car
there, not the fifth car back.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.721
Can I have my
telescope back, please?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.690
Sure, sure.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.392
Here you go.
Thank you.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.261
Why do you have that?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.396
Well, I brought it the first
night of our stakeout, remember?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.897
We were back at the docks.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.867
I thought it'd be a fun little
nautical theme for the car.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.802
Actually, this belongs
to my grandpa.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.604
He was a first class
seaman in the Navy.

01:43.637 --> 01:44.638
He picked this up in Malta.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.906
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.275
Lot of semen
in your family?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.610
Mm-hmm, yeah,
lot of seamen.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.780
My grandpa, uh...
my cousin Nathan,

01:52.813 --> 01:54.582
and his daughters,
both, all seamen.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.450
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.818
Is there any semen
on your mom's side?

01:57.851 --> 01:59.787
Oh, yeah, there's a lot
of seamen on my mom's side.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.255
My cousin is
on my mom's side.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.856
And my dad's side,
too, you know.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.592
On my dad's side there,
my Uncle Kevin.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.693
Yeah.
That's my dad's brother.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.660
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.330
But the rest of the
semen is on your mom?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.165
Uh... Mm-hmm.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.533
Load of semen,
all over your mom?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.268
Yeah.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.337
Do you not see
what I'm doing here?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.239
Semen.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.841
Semen, a load of semen
all over your mom.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.843
Yeah, yeah.
Honestly, I-I don't...
It's so obvious.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.678
I don't know how you don't
detect it, you know?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.614
It's-it's not
satisfying for me.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.249
Oftentimes, I'll make
a joke like that,

02:28.282 --> 02:29.450
and you just,
you won't get it.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.885
Oh. I get it.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.322
I really do.
I get the jokes.

02:34.355 --> 02:38.192
I just choose to not engage
in your type of humor. Okay?

02:38.226 --> 02:40.728
I'm a hard joke guy.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.397
This whole mean wordplay thing
that you've been doing lately,

02:43.431 --> 02:45.199
it doesn't look good on you.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.271
Mm-hmm.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.939
Mm-hmm, yup.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.408
This doesn't work.

02:54.442 --> 02:57.511
("Happiness, Missouri"
by El Vy playing)

02:57.545 --> 03:01.415

03:32.380 --> 03:34.515
FATIMA:
I just wanted to say

03:34.548 --> 03:37.485
I'm sorry for taking
dispatch for granted.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.625
And I'm sorry
I took you for granted.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.695
And I'm...

03:47.728 --> 03:49.730
I'm really, really,
really sorry.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.634
Okay, Janice, honestly,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.469
I don't know what
you want me to say here.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.338
I didn't ask you
to say anything.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.406
That's your guilt
filling the silence.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.407
Okay.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.741
Well...

04:00.774 --> 04:04.912
I guess I have been thinking
about it a lot, and...

04:04.945 --> 04:08.916
I could see myself
making a go of dispatch.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.620
Well, I guess 911
wasn't so exciting after all.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.621
So boring.
Mm.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.389
And so many prank calls.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.559
The worst were the ones where
people would call and just...

04:18.592 --> 04:19.727
just breathe heavily.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.529
That's a choker.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.063
What?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.598
If someone calls, right,

04:24.632 --> 04:26.367
and there's heavy breathing
on the other line,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.901
or they're not talking at all,

04:27.935 --> 04:31.572
83% of those people
are choking on something.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.541
Something's lodged
in their throat

04:33.574 --> 04:34.875
or they're physically
being choked.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.744
Either way, they can't talk.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.479
Right.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.848
So I assume
you called an ambulance?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.616
Yeah.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.532
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.501
I stole a baby.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.870
You stole a baby?
Yeah.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.004
Remember Karen?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.473
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.908
We'd gone through,
like, I don't know,

05:07.941 --> 05:10.444
four pregnancies that ended
in miscarriages and...

05:10.478 --> 05:11.745
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.813
Sorry.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.448
Eh.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.983
She really
wanted that baby,

05:16.016 --> 05:18.118
but I didn't want to put her
through another pregnancy,

05:18.151 --> 05:23.691
so I figured maybe the best
move would be to steal a baby.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.993
You know, in the middle of the
night from someone's house.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.761
Kind of the decent
thing to do.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.799
How so?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.768
Well, I guess I
kind of figured,

05:34.802 --> 05:38.071
if we stole someone's baby
from the supermarket

05:38.105 --> 05:41.675
or, you know, out of a stroller
at the park or something,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.511
the parent's
gonna always feel

05:43.544 --> 05:45.679
like they failed
the child somehow,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.415
like, they should've
been more attentive

05:47.448 --> 05:48.949
or they should've
been better parents.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.818
They would blame
themselves, like, every day

05:50.851 --> 05:52.653
for the rest
of their lives.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.390
But... if I just go
jimmy a window

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
in the middle
of the night,

05:57.725 --> 06:00.528
scoop a kid out of a,
out of a crib,

06:00.561 --> 06:02.863
there's no way the parents could
beat themselves up over that.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.898
They-- That's just,
like, you know,

06:04.932 --> 06:07.134
that's just a tragedy
that befell them, really.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.036
So you were trying
to be considerate...

06:09.069 --> 06:10.638
Yes, yes, exactly.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.972
...about the baby
you were stealing?

06:12.005 --> 06:12.940
You get it. Yeah.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.742
Okay.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.077
So, grabbed this really
cute little bundle of joy,

06:17.110 --> 06:19.046
brought her home.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.049
But... Karen had a
real problem with it

06:22.082 --> 06:27.087
just because, you know,
she felt, like...

06:27.120 --> 06:30.090
angry that I'd kept her
in the dark about the baby.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.493
You didn't tell her

06:32.526 --> 06:34.094
that you were planning
on stealing a baby?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.529
Oh, no.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.665
No, no, no, no.
It was a surprise.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.099
It was her birthday.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.101
It was, like, gonna
be the big present.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.437
She-- I got her, like,
a bunch of presents,

06:43.471 --> 06:45.939
and then this was gonna be
the last, final, big one.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.542
But the baby started crying
before she even unwrapped it,

06:48.576 --> 06:49.677
so the whole
thing was ruined.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.447
You wrapped the baby?
Yeah.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.083
I mean, like, I wrapped it
at the last second.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.652
I'm not, like, a...
I'm not a fucking monster.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.153
You know, but the
baby started crying,

07:00.187 --> 07:02.490
so she knew what
was in the thing.

07:02.523 --> 07:07.561
And that started a cascade
of classic Karen questions.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.897
"Where's this baby from?
Whose baby is this?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.099
What did you do?
How could you do this to me?"

07:12.132 --> 07:13.934
I feel like...
"How could you
do this to them?"

07:13.967 --> 07:15.803
...those are all questions
that I would also ask.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.071
Whatever. I ended up
taking the baby back.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.707
She and I split up,
and, you know,

07:19.740 --> 07:20.874
it was kind of
a blessing in disguise

07:20.908 --> 07:22.910
'cause it, like,
really brought out

07:22.943 --> 07:24.912
a bunch of the red flags
for me and Karen.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.180
You know, she was just
really ungrateful,

07:27.214 --> 07:29.049
complained a lot,
and couldn't appreciate

07:29.082 --> 07:31.018
that I was giving her
the things in life

07:31.051 --> 07:33.020
that she really wanted.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.955
So, bullet dodged.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.808
I think we're almost
there, cabrón.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.109
Yes.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.911
It's getting kind of
softer, you know.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.780
You know what's good about that?

07:59.813 --> 08:00.814
Huh?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.115
Now is the time

08:02.149 --> 08:05.519
to exchange the gifts.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.155
What

08:08.188 --> 08:09.990
Coming to the end
of the tunnel gifts.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.224
Oh.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.726
When-when you finish a...

08:12.760 --> 08:16.664
drug tunnel, you give each other
gifts to celebrate?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.166
You didn't get me anything?

08:19.199 --> 08:22.169
I just didn't know
it was a thing.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.538
Oh, my God.
Well...

08:24.572 --> 08:26.607
I don't even know if I should
give you your gift now.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.076
Don't give me the gift, man.
I don't deserve it.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.546
Okay.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.015
You really don't have to.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.985
You can be my assistant
in America.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.186
Up high.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.756
That's your fucking gift?

08:42.790 --> 08:45.258
Th
Really?

08:45.292 --> 08:48.161
Oh, okay.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.297
Th-The stones on you, cabrón.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.232
You make me feel bad?

08:52.265 --> 08:54.568
Employment in the greatest
country ever-- not a gift.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.003
No, it's not a gift.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.571
You know,
it's useless to me.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.939
First of all, assistant.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.608
Like, not even, like,
you know, partner.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.743
Right? Second of all,
I'm not going to America,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.645
so it is completely
worthless to me.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.780
Why not?
I don't know,
'cause I have a wife

09:06.814 --> 09:08.749
at home, that might
or might not love me,

09:08.782 --> 09:10.751
that I need to go back to.
Wait a second.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.052
Wait a second?
You wait a second.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.022
We agreed that you were
not going back to her.
No, no, no.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.324
You decided. I was a little
on the fence about it.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.092
But now I've made up my mind.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.629
Especially after seeing
the shitty gifts that await me.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.297
Well, maybe I'll just
take back my gift.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.899
You know what, Roberto?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.835
I think that would be
a good idea.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.673
All right.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.241
You made me do this, Miggie.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.877
You give me no choice.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.278
You're fired.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.247
You're no longer
my assistant.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.949
Good-bye.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.353
MAN : DEA confirms
raid is on tonight.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.289
MAN 2: Copy that.
We're informing all units?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.591
MAN:
Not yet. Soon.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.263
What's funny?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.898
Hmm?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.700
What are you
smiling about?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.234
Huh?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.636
Ah...

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
What?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.939
Well, yesterday, I was out

10:05.973 --> 10:07.140
putting up flyers
in the neighborhood.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.643
You know, trying to find
that dog Dennis?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.978
Oh, shitty Kyle's
shitty dog?

10:11.011 --> 10:13.714
Yeah, yeah, he's been lost.
Right. Right.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.348
So, anyways, I've been
trying to find him after work,

10:15.382 --> 10:16.750
so I've been going
around my neighborhood,

10:16.784 --> 10:18.786
putting up flyers everywhere.
Okay.

10:18.819 --> 10:22.289
So, yesterday, I stopped at this
vet's office in my neighborhood

10:22.322 --> 10:23.991
and asked her if I could
put up a flyer

10:24.024 --> 10:25.258
for the missing dog.
Right.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.760
We started talking,
and I was asking her

10:26.794 --> 10:28.762
about animals and stuff.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.164
So, anyways, we, um...
we went to have dinner.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.700
Right.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.301
And we started having drinks.
Okay.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.269
And, uh, we talked,
and we had more drinks

10:36.303 --> 10:38.271
and some more drinks.
Uh-huh. More drinks.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.708
And then I said,
"I better get you home."

10:40.741 --> 10:42.976
So I drove her home, right?
Okay. After the drinks?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.411
Yeah, after the drinks.
I was hoping

10:44.444 --> 10:45.846
you would skip over
that part.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.180
Doesn't matter,
doesn't matter.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.983
Anyways, uh, so, uh,
I get in front of her house.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.852
We're parked in my car,
and we start kissing and stuff.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.687
Okay.
Yeah, I mean,

10:53.721 --> 10:55.355
we're going at it
like two teenagers.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.324
And I haven't, I haven't
done that in a long time.

10:57.357 --> 11:02.129
I have not kissed a person
with an open mouth in decades.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.697
Decades?
Yeah.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.699
Yeah, Lisa does not like
open-mouth kissing.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.334
I didn't know--
You never told me that.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.036
Well, why would I
tell you that?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.271
It's kind of personal.
Yeah.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.206
Anyways,
back to my story.
Right.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.375
So, we're going at it,
we're in my car, you know,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.410
and then she says,
"Hey, come on in.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.912
We can make love
in my place."

11:18.946 --> 11:21.048
And I go, "Hey, baby,

11:21.081 --> 11:22.449
I got something
even better than that."

11:22.482 --> 11:24.818
Okay.
So guess where
I took her to.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.120
Where?
The yurt.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.757
Th-The yurt that
Kyle has been building?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.892
Yeah.
Why?

11:31.925 --> 11:32.960
'Cause why not?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.094
Fuck Kyle.
Right.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.163
He used my tools
to build that yurt.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.998
Uh-huh.
I took her into that yurt,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.067
and I laid her down,
and we started making love,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.735
and I just gave it
to her good.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.170
Right,
And then,

11:43.203 --> 11:44.805
when I reached my zenith,
Mm-hmm.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.040
I looked up, and guess
what I saw in the doorway.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.041
What?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.410
Dennis, the Irish wolfhound,

11:50.443 --> 11:51.979
staring at me.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.747
And I looked at him,
he looked at me.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.182
We locked eyes.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.885
And he knew he could not
fuck with me.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.119
Right.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.221
I was the leader
of the pack.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.823
Mm-hmm.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.892
He turned around and
hightailed it out of there.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.159
Oh, man.
Yeah.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.329
That's awesome.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.530
I just got a couple
questions, though,

12:10.563 --> 12:11.531
'cause it's, like,
it's awesome--

12:11.564 --> 12:12.365
It's an awesome story.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.867
What questions could you
possibly have?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.368
I covered every detail.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.237
Oh, totally,
totally, yeah.
Yeah.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.171
I mean, the detail
was so exquis...

12:18.205 --> 12:20.107
I just want to unpack
some of that detail.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.374
Just when you said, like,
"I reached my zenith."

12:21.408 --> 12:23.376
Yeah?
That means y

12:23.410 --> 12:25.212
Yes.
Right. Uh, yeah.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.513
And you looked
at the dog,

12:26.546 --> 12:28.882
and then the dog slunk
its tail and ran away.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.983
Yeah. Yeah.
You dominated the dog.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.985
Did it really happen?

12:33.453 --> 12:34.988
No.
That's okay.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.190
And, uh,
riddle me this.

12:37.224 --> 12:41.094
Was he even there?
Dennis the dog.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.030
No, he's still missing.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.098
Nobody knows where he is.
Okay, right.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.034
I'm buying it
a little more now.
Yeah.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.036
Were you even in the yurt?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.238
Not when we made love.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.206
We made love in her house.
Okay.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.575
And then I drove by the yurt
when I was going home.
Okay.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.845
But you did have sex
with her

12:57.878 --> 12:59.112
Yes.
You did.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.914
Hundred-percent true.
Okay.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.083
Well, that's all
that matters to me.
Okay.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.551
You know, I'm so
happy for you.
Thank you.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.888
Okay? And listen,
I want you to know...

13:07.921 --> 13:09.890
I don't need
the crazy stories

13:09.923 --> 13:11.992
and the narrative and
the yurt and the dog and...

13:12.025 --> 13:13.927
I don't need
that stuff, okay?
Okay.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.428
You did it. You.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.998
That's all that matters to me.
Yeah.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.500
Hey, you-you are
enough for me.
Thanks.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.270
Important you hear that.
Hey, look at me.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.038
You're enough.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.874
Thanks.
Okay.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.109
Hey, movie night.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.510
Streets of San Francisco?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.045
Yeah, Streets
of San Francisco.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.380
* Let's do it *

13:33.413 --> 13:35.148
You gonna take that for me?
Yeah, all right.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.850
I got a surprise for you
for movie night.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.052
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, you ready?

13:39.086 --> 13:41.621
* Bum ba dum bum ba da bum
Check it out.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.423
Oh, what's that?

13:43.456 --> 13:46.126
It is, uh, popcorn.
Fresh popcorn, my man.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.928
Popcorn in the car?
Yeah.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.196
It's gonna be good.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.163
Okay, yeah.
What the fuck?

13:50.197 --> 13:51.231
We're celebrating.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.465
So, what are we,
season one here?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.167
Season one.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.904
I'll do it.
I'll-I'll go first.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.838
Okay.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.143
ANGUS: Of course I'm happy
for you, Mom.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.645
Yes, that-that...

14:05.678 --> 14:08.581
I just wish you would have been
honest with me from the start,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.984
because I wouldn't have
invested so much in the guy.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.152
Does that make sense?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.320
Okay, okay.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.587
I-I got to go.
Love you, Mom.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.223
Bye.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.259
Your mom?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.129
How's she doing?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.964
Seeing someone else.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.966
Oh, really?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.367
She say who?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.138
Some new fucking idiot.
I don't know.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.640
Well, I don't know.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.943
You don't know that
he's an idiot.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.945
No, I do know he's an idiot,
because it's been

14:37.978 --> 14:41.014
a revolving door of idiots
for the majority of my life.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.983
Okay?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.617
I don't want to meddle,
but, like, maybe you should

14:44.651 --> 14:46.319
cut your mom some slack.
No.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.455
No, I'm not, I'm not even--
This new guy,

14:48.488 --> 14:50.257
whoever he is, I'm not
giving him a chance.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.658
I'm not even gonna try.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.027
I don't even want to meet him.
Fuck this guy.

14:54.061 --> 14:59.499
Well, maybe he's, like, a-a
kind, generous-of-spirit man

14:59.532 --> 15:03.636
who is sweet to her
and well-traveled and

15:03.670 --> 15:05.638
is someone...
something, uh--

15:05.672 --> 15:08.175
What?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.077
Well

15:10.110 --> 15:13.480
Yeah. You know, maybe
he's, like, seen the...

15:13.513 --> 15:16.383
Are you fucking
kidding me, Marco?!
Whoa.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.684
You?
What are you doing?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.519
Me what?

15:19.552 --> 15:20.954
What, Angus?

15:20.988 --> 15:22.422
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.058
No, you're the new
fucking idiot.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.559
What do you mean?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.695
You're the only person
that I've ever met

15:28.728 --> 15:30.463
that uses the term
"well-traveled"

15:30.497 --> 15:32.365
as if it's some kind
of a virtue.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.067
It's not, by the way.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.502
200 years ago,
maybe that was impressive,

15:35.535 --> 15:36.736
because it was hard
to get around.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.006
Now, who the fuck cares?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.640
I don't even know what
we're talking about right now.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.575
We're talking about the fact
that you're fucking my mom.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.744
I didn't say that.
Yeah, I know.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.114
I just figured that out,
and you won't admit it to me.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.415
Okay.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.618
I don't want to
lie to you, okay?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.620
This is not how I wanted you
to find out.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.588
Your mom and I planned on
taking you out to dinner

15:55.622 --> 15:57.324
after we finish this job...

15:57.357 --> 15:59.492
Oh, my God, no.
...to explain
the whole thing.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.994
How it happened,
what's going on,

16:01.028 --> 16:02.195
what the future is.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.298
TOLBECK:
Ooh, get him.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.000
Get those dirtbags.
Mm-hmm.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.669
That's gonna be us soon.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.204
Yeah, that's right.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.672
Hey, I thought we were
too far back.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.341
No, I think we
move pretty quick.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.376
I think we can get there
and bag us some dirt.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.710
Mm-hmm.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.712
More popcorn?

16:19.746 --> 16:21.314
Yeah, man.
The saltier the better.
All right.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.420
So this whole thing about me
giving you some sort of a sign

16:27.454 --> 16:29.156
that I wanted you
to kill Adrian,

16:29.189 --> 16:30.557
that was bullshit, right?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.625
It was because of
you and my mom.
Eh...

16:32.659 --> 16:35.095
Right?
I don't know, there might be
some truth to that.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.264
I might have had

16:37.297 --> 16:39.599
some personal motives
for killing Adrian.

16:39.632 --> 16:43.136
Okay, listen, I'm just gonna
tell you what happened.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.072
One day, your mom came up
to my room,

16:45.105 --> 16:46.606
when I was staying at the house,

16:46.639 --> 16:49.076
and she'd made
some sort of, um...

16:49.109 --> 16:51.044
lobster quiche?

16:51.078 --> 16:52.545
I took one bite.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.714
Honestly, I
don't get it.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.749
I thought it was disgusting.
I spit it on the floor.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.718
I-I'm not sure;
I was on all sorts of pain meds.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.221
I think I threw the dish
across the room at her.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.555
That pissed her off.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.557
So what, do you love my mom?

17:04.591 --> 17:06.726
I don't know if it's
love, but we have

17:06.759 --> 17:09.496
what is undeniably the most
sexually compatible relationship

17:09.529 --> 17:12.365
of my entire life.
She climbed on top of me,

17:12.399 --> 17:15.202
and I didn't know if she was
trying to fuck me or kill me,

17:15.235 --> 17:18.705
and that flipped a switch in me,
and I don't know, since then,

17:18.738 --> 17:21.341
I-I can't get enough of her,
you know?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.310
:
Oh, my God.

17:23.343 --> 17:27.214
She's gonna be really mad
that I told you, which...

17:27.247 --> 17:29.116
isn't the worst thing for me,

17:29.149 --> 17:31.151
'cause when she's mad,
she gets super horny.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.352
Holy shit, the hole.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.788
Marco. The hole is moving.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.756
What?
The hole's moving.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.125
Really?

17:38.158 --> 17:41.094
Fucking finally.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.630
All right. Here we go.
Don't fucking touch me.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.233
A-All right. Jesus.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.413
I think this
is it, cabrón.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.648
Are you ready?
Wait.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.851
I have to tell you something.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.719
What?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.489
I lied to you
about the other tunnel.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.758
I told you
I-I just quit.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.160
I didn't quit.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.427
They fired me.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.163
They said I didn't...

18:16.196 --> 18:18.898
have the right look
for that tunnel.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.900
Oh, Roberto.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.469
Hey.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.138
Who cares about
those guys?

18:25.172 --> 18:28.675
We made it, cabrón.
We're almost there.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.277
But what if I fail
at the stand

18:30.310 --> 18:31.811
What if I'm not funny?
What if I suck?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.247
What if all this writing
was for nothing, huh?

18:34.281 --> 18:37.150
No, cabrón. You are Roberto
the Experto, you hear me?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.619
They're gonna fucking
love you, cabrón.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.788
And all we got to do,
crawl through there,

18:41.821 --> 18:44.224
so you can go have your fame
and your entourage.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.393
You know?
The beautiful entourage, right?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.295
Are you ready
for this, cabrón?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.562
Yeah.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.663
Are you ready for this, cabrón?

18:50.697 --> 18:51.664
Yeah.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.633
America. Just for you.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.468
Ready?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.170
Let's do this, man.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.514
Inspector 73 to headquarters.

19:07.547 --> 19:11.251
I'm operating a takeout vehicle
and pursuing a felony suspect.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.452
Turn that off,
turn that off.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.287
Huh?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.722
Pursuing a turquoise...

19:15.755 --> 19:17.490
Yeah?
You hear something?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.959
...California license 8-8-3,
Ida, Nelly, Baker...

19:19.992 --> 19:21.694
No.
No.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.530
I don't know.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.732
Move it.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.468
What

19:28.501 --> 19:30.803
Shh.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.273
Where did that come from?

19:33.306 --> 19:34.707
That was gunfire. No?
Yeah.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.243
Where?

19:36.276 --> 19:37.777
Right over there.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.347
What the fuck? They haven't
called anything through.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.581
Oh, my... Oh, shit.
Where's the radio?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.483
Oh, shit.
What!

19:43.516 --> 19:44.951
I unplugged the radio.
I forgot to plug it back in.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.286
What the-- why
did you do that?!

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
Because of
the popcorn machine!

19:48.355 --> 19:50.690
You fucking idiot,
plug it back in!

19:50.723 --> 19:51.791
Oh. Oh, shit!

19:51.824 --> 19:53.660
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!
Oh...

19:53.693 --> 19:55.328
There it is!
It's on, it's on!

19:55.362 --> 19:57.330
Okay, okay.
FATIMA:
Car 14, suspect approaching.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.299
He should be
right on top of you.
We're missing it!

19:59.332 --> 20:01.901
We are missing this!
Oh, fuck!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.403
Come on!
It's not my fault.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.904
Shut up! Grab your vest.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.773
Oh, man, it's not my fault.
Jesus Christ.

20:06.806 --> 20:07.940
You and your fucking
fresh popcorn!

20:07.974 --> 20:09.542
Come on!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.511
Yeah, well, it makes
the movie experience better!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.546
Shut up!

20:13.580 --> 20:15.915
Copy that. Car 48,
proceed to the rear entrance.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.318
Unit 5, be advised
of an explosion

20:18.351 --> 20:19.819
at the northwest corner
of the warehouse.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.521
Possible
hazardous materials.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.689
Come on. Come on.
Coming.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.923
If we miss this,

20:23.956 --> 20:25.525
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.859
All right, go, go, go.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.461
Climb, climb.
Okay-- no, no, no.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.929
Boost me, boost me.
No, no!

20:29.962 --> 20:31.631
This way. Come on.
Oh, okay.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.966
Come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.702
CULLEN:
Get your gun. Get your gun.
TOLBECK: All right.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.504
Okay, here we go.
South...

20:37.537 --> 20:39.306
This is it.
Stand back, stand back.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.540
Okay, here we go.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.808
Here we go. Hey.
What the fuck?!

20:41.841 --> 20:42.775
Huh?
Did you just shoot that door?!

20:42.809 --> 20:44.043
Yeah. We had to get in!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.645
It doesn't lock!
It's okay!

20:45.678 --> 20:46.879
Pincer, pincer.
Pincer!

20:46.913 --> 20:48.648
Move, move, move!

20:48.681 --> 20:49.982
Tolbeck!
Got it, got it!

20:50.016 --> 20:51.718
We got him! Freeze!
Freeze! Freeze!

20:51.751 --> 20:52.985
Whoa, whoa, hey.
He's dead, he's dead.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.554
He's dead.
He is dead.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.688
Hey, don't touch the body!
It's okay.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.789
We were here first!
Slow down!

20:56.823 --> 20:58.491
Read the badge!
This is our bust!

20:58.525 --> 20:59.792
Here we go. Here we go.
To the left. To the left!

20:59.826 --> 21:01.594
Go, go, go!
Oh, man. Dead end.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.895
No, no, no. This way?
Dead end, dead end.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.864
Where is it
Okay, here we go.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.499
Here we go, here we go.
MARCO: All right, Angus.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.367
Let me call
your mom first.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.635
Hey, whoa. Hey.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.036
I know you. Hey, Paul!

21:10.069 --> 21:11.771
That's Paul. I know him.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.972
Cullen, look, a boat.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.374
I know. I see.
That's so cool.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.808
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

21:15.842 --> 21:17.810
Fuck me.
I got it, I got it!

21:17.844 --> 21:19.712
Here we go. Here we go.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.581
This is it.
Hey, watch out.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.583
What the...?
Hey, hey, stay back.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.817
No, no, no, it's okay.
This area's hot.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.519
This is our bust.
We were here first.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.555
Ch-Check it out.
Stay back.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.324
FATIMA:
Confirming all units.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.625
The raid is completed
and location is secure.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.427
Good job, everyone.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.062
Dispatch out.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.464
Not bad.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.932
Not bad at all.
Wow.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.101
Not bad? That was very good.
Yeah.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.903
Well, I told you
dispatch is where it's at.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.071
Yeah.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.406
But you're still on trial.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.074
No.
Yeah.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.076
I made you proud. I can tell.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.744
You didn't make me proud.

21:51.778 --> 21:52.912
It's part of the job.
Oh...

21:52.945 --> 21:54.947
I can see it.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.917
You're basically welling up,
tears of pride in your eyes.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.085
There aren't any tears
in my eyes.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.053
You didn't think
I could do it,

22:01.087 --> 22:03.022
and then I surpassed
your expectations.
Bing Bong.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.491
No. Bing Bong
doesn't work anymore.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.658
Says who?

22:05.692 --> 22:07.460
Me. I killed Bing Bong.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.761
Oh, geez, I'm shivering.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.762
Yeah.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.368
Ready for
another drug bust.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.438
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

22:18.471 --> 22:20.473
TOLBECK:
Well...

22:20.507 --> 22:21.708
looks like we missed it.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.443
You think?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.412
Yeah.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.547
Yep.
Why do you think that is?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.649
Oh, you know, certain factors.
Factors?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.384
Looks like-- yeah.
What kind of factors?

22:31.418 --> 22:33.420
Um, certain...

22:33.453 --> 22:35.388
Like you unplugging the radio
kind of factors?

22:35.422 --> 22:36.956
Well...
That the kind of factors you...

22:36.989 --> 22:38.391
Hey.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.462
That's it, that's it.
That's it between us.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.896
That's it.
Come on, you don't mean...

22:43.930 --> 22:46.433
No, no, no.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.900
Don't...
Come on, Cullen.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.602
Don't follow me!
Don't you follow me.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.037
Hey, put the...

22:51.070 --> 22:54.040
Fuck!

22:54.073 --> 22:56.809
Seriously, we are done
professionally!

22:58.778 --> 23:00.513
Fucking ass!

23:02.582 --> 23:03.883
Uh...

23:06.152 --> 23:07.987
Hey, Cullen, I need a ride home.

23:08.020 --> 23:12.892
Uh, my lunch
is in the car, also.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.894
TOLBECK:
Sorry I said that so loudly.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.195
You don't need
to hear about that.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.998
*

23:25.672 --> 23:26.873
* You won the prize *

23:26.906 --> 23:31.210
* At last, you found somebody

23:31.243 --> 23:32.579
* You won the prize *

23:32.612 --> 23:33.813
* Someone...

23:40.753 --> 23:43.856
Oh, shit. Cabrón, look.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.025
You think that's where
the fancy tunnel came out of?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.193
Maybe.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.929
MIGUEL: I guess we were
the backup tunnel, huh?

23:49.962 --> 23:52.098
ROBERTO:
That's a punch in the dick.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.200
I got to go.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.235
Wait. Roberto,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.236
Listen.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.038
Good luck.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.540
Yeah. Gracias.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.645
I'm coming
with you, cabrón.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.781
I always knew you would.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.819
Ah.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.787
Oh, Jesus. God.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.856
Yeah. So-- Jesus Christ,
let's...

24:16.889 --> 24:18.858
Disguises.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.161
That's so sweet
of you, man.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.830
Oh. Oh. I mean...
Ah.

24:23.863 --> 24:24.864
"Hello, gringo."

24:24.897 --> 24:26.833
Where are you?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.200
Ay, bien, where'd he go?

24:28.234 --> 24:29.536
Oh, but I need
an American name now, cabrón.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.270
Um...

24:31.303 --> 24:32.572
Michael.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.841
Michael? Mike.
Mike. Mike.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.008
Ah. "What's up? I'm Mike."

24:36.042 --> 24:37.176
Very gringo, huh?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.177
:
"Excuse me.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.679
How do you like your finances?"

24:41.080 --> 24:41.814
They like the money here.
Yeah, yeah.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.282
Yeah. What's your name gonna be?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.617
Mike. I have cable.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.785
Right.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.019
Okay, we're both Mike.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.656
I-I picked mine first, but...

24:49.689 --> 24:51.758
Listen, seriously,

24:51.791 --> 24:54.193
don't let people know that we
came out of the backup tunnel.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.295
Just completely shits
over my narrative.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.064
Okay. On it.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.700
I don't think
anybody would care though.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.870
People care.
America's about first place.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.838
* You won the prize *
