00:25.575 --> 00:29.893
Once the world was full of wonders,

00:29.895 --> 00:32.615
but it belongs to humans now.

00:33.695 --> 00:36.733
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

00:36.735 --> 00:39.735
demons, vampires and witches...

00:41.575 --> 00:47.533
hiding in plain sight,
fearful of discovery,

00:47.535 --> 00:50.215
ill at ease, even with each other.

00:52.495 --> 00:58.895
But, as my father used to say,
in every ending...

01:01.015 --> 01:03.175
there is a new beginning.

01:19.695 --> 01:22.095
Please!
Enough!

01:29.615 --> 01:31.933
A witch in flight!

01:31.935 --> 01:35.173
I haven't seen that for many,

01:35.175 --> 01:36.895
many years.

01:40.535 --> 01:44.893
It's difficult to know when she's
been with De Clermont, where...

01:44.895 --> 01:47.495
her scents begin and his...

01:48.335 --> 01:49.655
end.

01:53.775 --> 01:56.133
Is it lust...

01:56.135 --> 01:59.415
as well as the book that attracted...

02:00.415 --> 02:02.375
Matthew to you.

02:03.455 --> 02:06.335
Women, after all...

02:07.815 --> 02:09.973
are his weakness.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.895
Take your hands off her.

02:16.655 --> 02:20.493
I want to examine her.

02:20.495 --> 02:22.653
Stick to what we agreed, Gerbert.

02:22.655 --> 02:25.413
I got her out from Sept-Tours.

02:25.415 --> 02:29.935
You couldn't. You'll have your time
with her after I've had mine.

02:31.895 --> 02:33.815
She's all yours.

02:37.135 --> 02:38.855
What do you want from me?

02:44.615 --> 02:48.373
Relax.
We are both witches, Diana.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.135
I'm not your enemy.

02:54.855 --> 02:57.373
No!
No!

02:57.375 --> 03:00.813
Now, no one can listen in
and there is no way out.

03:00.815 --> 03:03.735
I want to know
how powerful you really are.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.575
-Would you show me?
-I don't have any power.

03:09.495 --> 03:12.413
Why didn't you fly
when I dropped you, I wonder?

03:12.415 --> 03:14.413
Because I can't fly.

03:14.415 --> 03:16.375
Can't or won't?

03:18.095 --> 03:21.015
Your family never teached you
how to use your magic?

03:22.015 --> 03:24.653
It was their duty as your guardians.

03:24.655 --> 03:27.493
Not every witch
shows magical aptitude.

03:27.495 --> 03:29.975
You're not just any witch, Diana.

03:32.175 --> 03:33.535
You're a Bishop.

03:34.295 --> 03:37.055
It did not escape their notice
that you were powerful.

03:38.095 --> 03:40.375
They've done you
a great disservice, Diana.

03:41.495 --> 03:44.655
My mummo taught me
how to fly when I was a girl.

03:46.255 --> 03:49.573
She was the one who helped me
understand my magic

03:49.575 --> 03:51.215
and embrace my power.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.175
Let me be the one to help you.

04:01.935 --> 04:04.215
Show me the power inside you...

04:05.575 --> 04:08.175
and I can teach you how to control it.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.415
You don't need to go
through this alone.

04:15.895 --> 04:18.214
I am not alone.

04:18.654 --> 04:20.135
The vampire.

04:23.935 --> 04:26.613
It's vital that I help you
control your power

04:26.615 --> 04:29.213
so you can protect yourself
from Clairmont.

04:29.215 --> 04:30.935
We don't have much time.

04:32.455 --> 04:35.093
Gerbert will be back for you soon.

04:35.095 --> 04:37.455
And if you want to make it
out of here alive...

04:38.775 --> 04:41.535
then you need to start
co-operating with me.

04:42.895 --> 04:45.375
Matthew isn't the one
I need protecting from.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.375
He isn't the one holding me
against my will.

04:50.775 --> 04:52.933
I'm not going to tell you anything.

04:52.935 --> 04:55.175
So there is something you're hiding?

04:59.455 --> 05:01.253
Matthew deceived you.

05:01.255 --> 05:03.573
He only ever wanted
the lost manuscript.

05:03.575 --> 05:05.933
-That's not true.
-He'll take what he wants

05:05.935 --> 05:09.535
and he'll dispose of you,
just like he did with Gillian.

05:10.255 --> 05:12.735
-Gillian?
-She broke into Clairmont's lab.

05:16.055 --> 05:18.453
She's just like you.

05:18.455 --> 05:20.653
Working for Knox.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.895
Doing anything he says
just to please him.

05:24.175 --> 05:27.655
-Everyone follows him blindly.
-Gillian's dead.

05:30.695 --> 05:32.695
Clairmont killed her.

05:33.895 --> 05:36.535
The Oxford coven leader
found her dead body.

05:37.895 --> 05:39.215
No.

05:40.295 --> 05:42.453
No, Matthew wouldn't do that.

05:42.455 --> 05:45.053
Bite marks all over her neck.

05:45.055 --> 05:47.215
The body drained of blood.

05:48.055 --> 05:50.055
Such a brutal attack.

05:51.815 --> 05:54.215
Stop fighting your true nature.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.695
Stop!

06:10.215 --> 06:11.535
Good.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.813
Let's see what other power you have

06:17.815 --> 06:19.935
besides the ability
to protect your mind.

06:23.535 --> 06:27.575
There are two powerful witches here.
One light...

06:28.575 --> 06:30.093
the other dark.

06:30.095 --> 06:34.053
Beware of the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

06:34.055 --> 06:35.375
Tell me...

06:36.255 --> 06:37.735
which one is it?

06:41.375 --> 06:43.733
You're a traitor, Diana.

06:43.735 --> 06:45.893
A traitor and a disgrace.

06:45.895 --> 06:49.133
You betrayed your own kind
for a vampire.

06:49.135 --> 06:50.933
Think of your parents.

06:50.935 --> 06:53.133
What that would do to them.

06:53.135 --> 06:56.973
How dare you talk about my parents!
You didn't know them!

06:56.975 --> 06:59.093
I was the one that was betrayed!

06:59.095 --> 07:02.855
I grew up believing that humans
in their ignorance killed my parents.

07:03.975 --> 07:06.135
But it was witches!

07:09.455 --> 07:12.695
This pathetic witch wind
doesn't work on me.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.255
You're a liar, Diana.

07:22.415 --> 07:24.335
Don't you think I did research?

07:26.975 --> 07:28.855
I know what happened.

07:30.695 --> 07:34.215
Witches murdered my parents
and they covered it up.

07:35.575 --> 07:37.173
Ask Knox.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.015
Ask him!

07:41.655 --> 07:45.013
But then it must be because
they were keeping secrets.

07:45.015 --> 07:47.375
Like you are doing now.

07:50.255 --> 07:52.293
What are you going to do?

07:52.295 --> 07:55.455
Are you going to kill me?
Like the witches did to them.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.855
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

08:37.054 --> 08:38.375
Diana?

08:56.175 --> 08:58.533
I call upon the elements.

08:58.535 --> 08:59.855
Satu!

09:00.575 --> 09:04.295
I call upon the dark and the light
to illuminate what is hidden.

09:06.135 --> 09:08.853
Power, power, I open thy.

09:08.855 --> 09:12.255
Power, power,
let thy power tie with I.

09:30.735 --> 09:32.695
Tell me your secrets.

09:33.695 --> 09:36.373
I don't have any secrets!

09:36.375 --> 09:38.695
-Avata!
-No!

09:43.495 --> 09:49.173
Please! No!
No!

09:49.175 --> 09:50.775
Please!

09:51.855 --> 09:53.175
Please!

11:14.930 --> 11:16.250
Sarah!

11:18.530 --> 11:20.928
What is it? What did you see?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.250
Diana.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.530
She's in pain.

11:29.010 --> 11:30.730
Please! No!

11:49.370 --> 11:51.770
Show me your secrets.

11:52.930 --> 11:54.250
Avata!

11:55.850 --> 12:00.328
I call upon the dark and the light
to reveal your powers, Diana.

12:00.330 --> 12:01.650
Oh, please!

12:03.290 --> 12:06.128
Show me what you're
hiding inside of you.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.450
Diana?

12:23.850 --> 12:25.690
No! Please!

12:26.610 --> 12:30.370
Stop fighting me and show me
what you're hiding inside of you.

12:35.770 --> 12:39.330
What's the Congregation done with her?
Where is she?

12:55.050 --> 12:57.448
I'll kill you if you've harmed her.
Where is she?!

12:57.450 --> 13:01.488
If I knew where she was, I'd have
taken her back to Venice already!

13:01.490 --> 13:05.208
It's Diana.
I caught her scent in the garden.

13:05.210 --> 13:08.688
Mixed with another.
Someone else was here.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.450
She's gone.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.210
No!

13:20.930 --> 13:22.250
Avata!

13:27.530 --> 13:29.850
It's no victory, Diana.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.650
This is where the scent ends.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.290
How can that be?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.328
That would take a rare witch.

14:12.330 --> 14:15.008
-It's possible.
-They flew.

14:15.010 --> 14:18.248
No witch has ever violated
De Clermont territory before.

14:18.250 --> 14:21.008
They wouldn't dare.
This will start a war between species.

14:21.010 --> 14:23.170
Vampires and witches.

14:24.170 --> 14:27.568
I should never have let Gillian go.
Just must be involved in it.

14:27.570 --> 14:31.568
Knox was eager for the witch to be
interrogated by the Congregation.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.208
But he couldn't have taken her,
not directly.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.288
How can you be so sure?

14:35.290 --> 14:38.368
Peter Knox doesn't have
that kind of power.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.248
Doesn't have the ability to fly.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.410
Who does?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.208
-Baldwin.
-Where are you?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.248
Sat here in the archives
waiting for you.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.568
Don't fuck with me, Peter!

15:24.570 --> 15:28.128
A witch has taken Diana from
Sept-Tours. Now where is she?

15:28.130 --> 15:30.488
I assure you, this has
nothing to do with me.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.488
You're the most powerful witch
on the Congregation.

15:32.490 --> 15:36.528
You are clearly involved in this. Now,
where is Sigismund and the new witch?

15:36.530 --> 15:41.248
Sigismund is stood in front of me
and Satu...

15:41.250 --> 15:42.650
Satu's here too.

15:44.930 --> 15:47.610
God help you
if you're lying to me, Peter.

15:54.610 --> 15:57.050
Where is Satu?

16:01.570 --> 16:03.610
You don't have to do this, Satu!

16:16.530 --> 16:20.850
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.248
We need to start
thinking like witches.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.128
How they would have...

16:27.130 --> 16:30.288
taken her outside
of vampire territory.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.130
We need to split up.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.530
Widen our search area.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.688
Limousin.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.328
Rhône-Alpes.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.128
-Bourgogne.
-She's nearby, Matthew.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.288
A thousand years ago,

16:44.290 --> 16:47.168
even the most powerful witches

16:47.170 --> 16:50.288
were only capable
of flying short distances.

16:50.290 --> 16:53.528
This witch would have been slowed down
by having to carry Diana.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.248
She most still be in the Auvergne.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.688
If that's true, then one of our
neighbors could be harboring them.

16:57.690 --> 17:01.088
Is this witch really worth going
to war against our own for?

17:01.090 --> 17:02.730
Yes!

17:05.050 --> 17:07.290
Now help me!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.290
What happened?

17:14.569 --> 17:16.130
Where's the witch?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.930
Down the hole.

17:23.730 --> 17:27.688
Get her out.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.288
I need more time.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.608
You had your time.
She belongs to me now.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.050
Get her out!

17:36.170 --> 17:37.650
I can't.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.730
My powers have gone.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.770
What has she done to you?

17:47.450 --> 17:52.128
Couldn't have taken her south,
it's too mountainous, too barren.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.008
That's exactly why
they've taken her there.

17:54.010 --> 17:55.768
It's difficult to get to,
they wouldn't be disturbed.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.128
South. That's Gerbert's territory.

17:58.130 --> 18:02.008
It's possible Gerbert aligned himself
with whoever took your witch.

18:02.010 --> 18:05.210
He's tried to bring
the De Clermonts down for centuries.

18:06.330 --> 18:10.690
If Gerbert took her, then
I know what he's capable of.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.570
He will destroy her
so he can destroy me.

18:17.090 --> 18:18.410
Christ!

18:24.130 --> 18:26.008
Sarah.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.128
Matthew, where have you been?

18:28.130 --> 18:30.488
What's happened to Diana?

18:30.490 --> 18:32.970
Em sees her in darkness.

18:34.450 --> 18:37.608
She's been taken... by a witch.

18:37.610 --> 18:40.448
-She what?!
-Emily, tell me anything...

18:40.450 --> 18:42.728
everything that you may have seen
that could possibly help us find her.

18:42.730 --> 18:47.088
I saw a... I think it was a castle
or used to be a castle.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.448
And I saw two figures with her.

18:49.450 --> 18:51.410
That's all I can make out.

18:55.370 --> 18:59.008
Thank you. We'll phone
when we have more news.

18:59.010 --> 19:01.808
Matthew, wait! Matthew!

19:01.810 --> 19:03.488
Gerbert.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.888
He had a castle hidden
high in the mountains.

19:06.890 --> 19:09.128
It's in ruins now.

19:09.130 --> 19:15.930
Centuries ago...
he kept a witch enthralled there.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.490
La Pierre.

19:20.930 --> 19:22.770
Quickest by helicopter.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.328
How long till we get there?

19:32.330 --> 19:34.850
ETA's 16 minutes, sir.

20:07.730 --> 20:09.690
It's time to wake up.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.490
You said you'd tell me a story.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.688
But no bad parts.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.008
It doesn't work that way, Diana.

20:36.010 --> 20:39.248
I can't skip the bad parts
of the story.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.450
-You have to face them.
-No!

20:46.930 --> 20:50.490
Diana was locked in the dark room,
all alone.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.528
A witch trapped me inside.

20:54.530 --> 20:56.410
She wondered how
she would ever get out.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.930
But then, she heard
a knocking at the door.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.770
It was the Prince.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.568
He used all of his strength
to open the locked door,

21:11.570 --> 21:14.010
but he still couldn't get to her.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.130
Then how did she get out?

21:18.410 --> 21:20.808
Diana spied a hole in the roof,

21:20.810 --> 21:24.408
just big enough for her
to squeeze through.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.250
So she called up to him.

21:30.090 --> 21:32.290
Fly down and lift me out.

21:33.450 --> 21:36.008
But the Prince couldn't fly,

21:36.010 --> 21:38.050
so Diana had to help herself.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.330
Mum?

22:28.945 --> 22:30.943
We're over the castle, sir.

22:30.945 --> 22:33.463
There's nowhere nearby to land.

22:33.465 --> 22:37.065
We'll have to jump. Land
the helicopter as near as you can.

22:38.865 --> 22:41.703
Why don't you try to the right
of those trees down there?

22:41.705 --> 22:43.863
Once you've landed,
don't move till we come back.

22:43.865 --> 22:45.185
Copy that, sir.

22:48.025 --> 22:50.785
What did you find out
about Diana Bishop's powers?

22:51.585 --> 22:53.585
Nothing that I would share with you.

23:08.705 --> 23:11.103
What have you done to her?

23:11.105 --> 23:14.025
This is what happens to witches
who don't co-operate.

23:37.305 --> 23:38.625
On my mark.

23:40.145 --> 23:41.465
Jump!

23:52.665 --> 23:53.985
Diana?

23:57.825 --> 23:59.185
This way.

24:00.185 --> 24:02.783
I can feel your power.

24:02.785 --> 24:05.145
Whoever you are,
help me help both of us.

24:38.465 --> 24:41.343
-Matthew!
-Oh, no! Diana!

24:41.345 --> 24:42.665
Matthew!

24:44.785 --> 24:46.623
-I can't get out!
-I'm coming down.

24:46.625 --> 24:50.025
No, Matthew! You'll get down but you
won't be able to get her back out.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.983
It's time.

24:54.985 --> 24:57.065
Remember the story.

25:02.945 --> 25:04.265
Fly.

25:15.025 --> 25:16.345
Fly!

25:19.545 --> 25:22.465
Magic is in the heart. Don't forget.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.345
We will always be one.

25:28.225 --> 25:30.463
Magic's in the heart.

25:30.465 --> 25:32.425
I can't get down to you, Diana!

25:33.545 --> 25:34.865
Fly.

25:44.065 --> 25:46.865
You can do it!
You're doing it, Diana. That's it!

25:50.945 --> 25:52.425
Gently, gently.

25:53.945 --> 25:55.543
-Matthew.
-That's it, Diana.

25:55.545 --> 25:57.465
I've got you.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.785
Let's get her out of here.

26:54.665 --> 26:56.823
I'm glad you're safe.

26:56.825 --> 26:58.863
I should call Sarah and Em.

26:58.865 --> 27:01.185
Ysabeau will call them
and let them know you're safe.

27:05.065 --> 27:06.905
I'll never let you go again.

27:13.345 --> 27:14.825
Come on.

27:24.505 --> 27:26.425
My face hit the floor.

27:27.425 --> 27:30.625
-Is the bone broken?
-No, no, it's just badly bruised.

27:32.745 --> 27:35.305
I'll examine you properly when
we get you cleaned up a little.

27:38.105 --> 27:40.105
You showed such strength.

27:41.265 --> 27:42.905
My lionne.

27:51.785 --> 27:53.665
How did this actually happen?

27:55.385 --> 27:59.425
Oh, Satu wanted to see my power.

28:00.785 --> 28:03.345
She tried to rip me apart.

28:17.825 --> 28:19.145
All right.

28:19.585 --> 28:22.583
I think you'd be more comfortable
in bed. Shall we?

28:22.585 --> 28:24.505
Put your arm round me.

28:27.585 --> 28:30.263
-What is it, your back?
-Yeah.

28:30.265 --> 28:32.423
It's tender.

28:32.425 --> 28:35.305
Satu used her magic on me.

28:36.905 --> 28:39.105
Would it be all right
if I take a quick look?

28:41.625 --> 28:43.825
We need to take this off.

28:50.385 --> 28:51.705
Scissors.

28:53.385 --> 28:55.865
I'm going to have to
cut your top off, Diana.

29:16.865 --> 29:18.583
What is it?

29:18.585 --> 29:20.463
Marie, Dieu mère!

29:20.465 --> 29:22.383
It's my insignia.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.345
She's branded you.

29:27.025 --> 29:29.545
Do you want to see
what she did to you?

29:31.225 --> 29:34.583
-Yes, show me.
-Matthew, no, she's been through enough.

29:34.585 --> 29:36.543
She survived the doing of it.

29:36.545 --> 29:38.825
The seeing of it
can't possibly be worse.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.305
I've got you.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.065
Are you ready?

30:02.265 --> 30:03.585
Yes.

30:24.265 --> 30:27.705
Satu said she was
going to open me up.

30:37.425 --> 30:39.145
But she didn't.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.705
Thank you.

32:14.185 --> 32:16.063
You should really
try and eat something.

32:16.065 --> 32:17.985
Did you kill Gillian?

32:20.985 --> 32:22.665
No, I didn't.

32:23.825 --> 32:26.745
But I should have killed her,
for betraying you.

32:27.985 --> 32:29.623
I spared her life.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.145
And I will not...

32:32.425 --> 32:33.905
make the same mistake again.

32:35.185 --> 32:37.703
And I will hunt down anyone
who wishes to harm you

32:37.705 --> 32:39.625
and I will kill them.

32:40.585 --> 32:42.065
I told you.

32:43.065 --> 32:45.065
I know you told me.

32:52.385 --> 32:54.185
Promise me one thing.

32:55.185 --> 32:56.505
Name it.

32:57.385 --> 32:59.585
You won't go after Satu.

33:00.585 --> 33:03.025
I want to deal with her myself.

33:11.585 --> 33:13.423
How's the witch?

33:13.425 --> 33:15.745
Her name is Diana, and she's resting.

33:17.585 --> 33:21.023
-Thank you.
-No need to thank me, Matthew.

33:21.025 --> 33:23.265
I'll be taking her back
to the Congregation with me.

33:25.145 --> 33:28.663
You would have her face Gerbert
and the other witches,

33:28.665 --> 33:31.583
knowing full well
what they would do to her?

33:31.585 --> 33:33.703
I've made my decision.

33:33.705 --> 33:35.265
I won't discuss it further.

33:38.505 --> 33:41.145
-Diana is staying here.
-I'm the head of this family!

33:46.025 --> 33:48.665
To protect the De Clermonts,
I will disown you.

33:50.865 --> 33:52.985
This is no longer a family matter.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.743
The Knights of Lazarus will
see to Diana Bishop's protection.

33:57.745 --> 34:00.823
After all these years defunct,

34:00.825 --> 34:05.105
you're going to rally the Knights of
Lazarus to protect a fucking witch?!

34:10.225 --> 34:13.505
You are a Knight
and you are my brother.

34:14.824 --> 34:16.824
We fought at the Battle of Acre.

34:17.985 --> 34:21.263
Helped the Albigensian heretics
resist the Northerners.

34:21.264 --> 34:24.023
We do not come to the aid
of our master

34:24.025 --> 34:26.223
to protect a forbidden love affair!

34:26.225 --> 34:28.743
Diana is in need of our protection
from her own people

34:28.745 --> 34:30.985
and I will see to it that she gets it.

34:32.145 --> 34:35.545
Philippe should never have passed
the order on to you when he died.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.623
Baldwin de Clermont,

34:39.625 --> 34:42.743
I call upon you to fulfill your sworn
oath and enter the battlefield,

34:42.745 --> 34:45.945
where you will obey my commands
until I release you.

34:51.864 --> 34:54.465
As for the Congregation
pursuing Diana?

34:55.344 --> 34:58.785
I'll try and make punishment
for Knox's new witch their priority.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.505
Thank you.

35:22.425 --> 35:24.543
You've both shown that
you have some fight in you.

35:24.545 --> 35:27.105
Hold on to that because
you're going to need it.

35:28.225 --> 35:30.305
Do whatever it is you must to survive.

35:31.305 --> 35:33.105
You can't hold the Congregation
off forever.

35:36.745 --> 35:39.583
It's imperative that you make your
next move before they make theirs.

35:39.585 --> 35:40.905
Do you understand?

35:43.825 --> 35:47.425
Diana.
Till we meet again.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.585
Who are you?

36:32.545 --> 36:34.385
What did he do to you?

36:35.745 --> 36:37.505
I know that you're old.

36:39.065 --> 36:40.465
Very old.

36:42.385 --> 36:44.265
I felt that in your magic.

36:52.385 --> 36:53.945
Meridiana.

36:57.865 --> 37:00.863
Are you the Meridiana?

37:00.865 --> 37:02.225
Yes.

37:04.025 --> 37:05.345
Helvetti!

37:06.825 --> 37:09.143
He kept you all of this time.

37:09.145 --> 37:11.063
Help me.

37:11.065 --> 37:12.545
Release me.

37:15.105 --> 37:19.305
You'll join the mothers
on the other side, as you.

37:21.145 --> 37:22.625
Only you.

37:23.665 --> 37:25.465
None of him.

37:36.705 --> 37:40.225
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

37:41.225 --> 37:44.745
For with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

37:45.825 --> 37:47.745
The lion and the wolf?

37:52.185 --> 37:56.063
Is it the baby? Are you taking
care of yourself, eating right?

37:56.065 --> 37:58.665
No, no. I'm fine and so is the baby.

37:59.665 --> 38:01.105
Just listen, Mum.

38:03.905 --> 38:05.463
Would you like some tea?

38:05.465 --> 38:07.023
No, no, no.
I want to know what's going on.

38:07.025 --> 38:08.345
Soph.

38:12.905 --> 38:16.503
You said you might know
who the witch is

38:16.505 --> 38:18.623
that I need to give my statue to...

38:18.625 --> 38:21.303
I shouldn't have told you anything.
I'm sorry if I got you excited.

38:21.305 --> 38:23.663
She's not someone for you
to be getting involved with.

38:23.665 --> 38:27.903
-She's trouble.
-She's in trouble, Agatha.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.705
I... I see her in my dreams.

38:32.025 --> 38:36.663
And I think that our connection
is so strong because...

38:36.665 --> 38:38.503
she's a witch and...

38:38.505 --> 38:39.825
Well...

38:42.785 --> 38:45.225
I was born of witches.

38:54.145 --> 38:56.503
-You're a witch?
-No. No. I'm...

38:56.505 --> 38:59.583
I'm a demon, but...
but my parents witches

38:59.585 --> 39:03.225
and my grandparents
and theirs before them and...

39:09.385 --> 39:11.143
It can't be possible.

39:11.145 --> 39:14.703
Does that mean the baby
could be a witch?

39:14.705 --> 39:17.945
I've got a pretty strong feeling
that she is.

39:19.305 --> 39:21.103
And you didn't think to tell me?

39:21.105 --> 39:23.703
If our baby is a witch
born of demons,

39:23.705 --> 39:26.703
she'll be everything the Congregation
fears and wants to destroy.

39:26.705 --> 39:30.303
You didn't trust me.

39:30.305 --> 39:32.063
My God, Nathaniel!

39:32.065 --> 39:34.345
We didn't want to put you
in a difficult position.

39:35.945 --> 39:37.385
I'm your mother.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.143
You come first.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.465
Both of you do.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.225
I'm this child's grandmother.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.745
My loyalty and love are to you.

39:49.385 --> 39:52.823
We... didn't mean to upset you.

39:52.825 --> 39:55.543
Everything's more complicated now.

39:55.545 --> 39:58.703
The witch is important, Agatha,
for me and the baby.

39:58.705 --> 40:00.265
I just know she is.

40:07.025 --> 40:08.665
Her name is Diana Bishop.

40:30.065 --> 40:32.585
Thank you, weaver.

40:39.825 --> 40:41.145
Weaver?

40:50.105 --> 40:51.785
I feel so different.

40:52.785 --> 40:55.823
-The air in my lungs.
-It's no wonder.

40:55.825 --> 40:58.585
You've been liberated,
inside and out.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.545
Unbound.

41:04.105 --> 41:07.905
I think we've established
she doesn't need coddling.

41:09.905 --> 41:13.143
I'm... I'm sorry. Am I...

41:13.145 --> 41:14.863
Am I missing something?

41:14.865 --> 41:18.143
We believe that you may
have been spellbound.

41:18.145 --> 41:19.865
Do you know what that is?

41:21.625 --> 41:25.025
-Yes, but...
-And what happened to you at La Pierre

41:27.425 --> 41:28.905
freed your magic.

41:30.185 --> 41:31.505
Diana.

41:32.225 --> 41:34.503
Do you know who could
have done such a thing to you?

41:34.505 --> 41:36.945
No, but I don't understand.

41:37.985 --> 41:40.225
Only witches who were mad
were ever spellbound.

41:43.785 --> 41:45.545
Witches who hurt people.

41:53.185 --> 41:54.665
What am I?

42:00.185 --> 42:02.703
-Home.
-Tell me the truth.

42:02.705 --> 42:04.743
All this time, did you know
what was wrong with me?

42:04.745 --> 42:07.543
-What's going on?
-Did you know that I was spellbound?

42:07.545 --> 42:10.103
You killed Rebecca Bishop
and Stephen Proctor.

42:10.105 --> 42:12.863
The power was never theirs.

42:12.865 --> 42:14.343
It was Diana's.

42:14.345 --> 42:16.423
No! I tested her!

42:16.425 --> 42:19.263
There's a prophesy about
the end of the vampires.

42:19.265 --> 42:21.263
I think it has to do with Diana.

42:21.265 --> 42:23.183
Where are the spells for self-defense?

42:23.185 --> 42:25.503
Those spells haven't worked
in generations.

42:25.505 --> 42:26.983
She needs to learn control.

42:26.985 --> 42:30.223
And you can teach me
how to defend myself, Matthew.

42:30.225 --> 42:33.503
-Is that what I think it is?
-Ashmole 782.

42:33.505 --> 42:38.145
You said do not... run.
