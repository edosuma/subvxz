- I am Guillermo Lima and I
will fight for your rights!

03:47.393 --> 03:48.645
Do not trust your life
to a string of code.

03:48.728 --> 03:53.274
Artificially intelligent
does not equal smart.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.484
- [Announcer] Guillermo
Lima wins cases,

03:54.567 --> 03:59.113
and if he doesn't

to plead not guilty?

04:58.631 --> 04:59.507
Please repeat the words.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.134
I didn't do anything.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.886

12:33.461 --> 12:35.045
Learn a trade... (indistinct)

12:35.129 --> 12:37.590
- (ominous music)
- Oh fuck!

12:37.673 --> 12:41.260
- [Drone] Mateo Torres, please
enter a plea for your trial.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.304
- You said 90 days,
it hasn't even being--

12:43.387 --> 12:45.181
- Looks like your
trial is ready.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.558
I strongly recommend
you plead guilty.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.602
A plea deal will result
in a lesser punishment

12:49.685 --> 12:51.228
of five to seven years.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.230
Do you want to
enter a guilty plea?

12:53.314 --> 12:56.066
Please say I plead
guilty to accept.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.109
Wait.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.486
- [Drone] Please
state your plea.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.403
Wait!

12:59.487 --> 13:00.446
Sorry, I didn't get that.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.490
Do you want to
enter a guilty plea?

13:02.573 --> 13:05.409
Please say, I plead
guilty to accept.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.995
(ominous music)

13:22.551 --> 13:23.969
I plead guilty.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.888
- A guilty plea means that
you accept responsibility

13:25.971 --> 13:27.389
for your actions and
that you are ready

13:27.473 --> 13:29.725
to face the consequences
of those actions.

13:29.808 --> 13:30.935
Do you understand?

13:31.018 --> 13:31.936
Say yes to confirm
your guilty plea.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.694
(ominous music)

13:49.954 --> 13:51.330
(upbeat music)

13:51.413 --> 13:52.706
Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:54.833 --> 13:55.584
Yes!

13:55.668 --> 13:57.670
I'm sorry, did you say yes?

13:57.753 --> 13:58.879
Please say yes to confirm.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.756
- No, no, no. Not
guilty, not guilty.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.842
- Are you sure that you
want to plead not guilty?

14:03.926 --> 14:04.718
Please say.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.887
I'm not guilty, not guilty.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.847
- [Droid] Your not guilty
plea has being recorded

14:08.931 --> 14:11.725
and thank you for
your cooperation.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.896
- Are you sure that you
want to plead not guilty.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.814
Please repeat the word--

14:16.897 --> 14:17.815
Fuck you.

14:20.192 --> 14:20.901
Ready to win.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
(phone ringing)

14:27.866 --> 14:29.910
(computer beeping)

14:33.247 --> 14:36.417
Hi. Can, can you hear me?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.837
- Yes Mr. Torres, I'm
looking through your file

14:39.920 --> 14:41.755
and frankly it
doesn't look good.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.634
I strongly suggest
you take the plea deal

14:45.718 --> 14:46.760
that they've offered you.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.137
But I didn't do anything.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.557
Mr. Torres...

14:54.852 --> 14:56.895
Damn it, not again.

14:56.979 --> 14:57.688
Um...

14:57.771 --> 14:58.606
What?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.858
Son stay there, just wait.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.026
(computer beeping)

15:02.109 --> 15:02.192
No...

15:07.281 --> 15:09.908
(solemn music)

15:13.495 --> 15:15.456
- [Woman] Would you
like to place a call?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.958
(solemn music continues)

15:48.530 --> 15:50.324
- [Woman] We hope you
enjoyed your stay.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.327
Please exit the room to
start the discharge process.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.058
(upbeat music)

16:43.043 --> 16:45.838
(buzzer buzzing)

16:53.637 --> 16:56.265
- [Evie] Good morning
Mateo, how can I help you?

16:56.348 --> 16:59.184
- [Jorge] Yoh! Where are
you? I covered your shift

16:59.268 --> 17:01.603
but Anna is asking
where you are.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.106
- [Anna] Hi Mateo, this is
Anna, this is your second day

17:04.189 --> 17:06.024
at work, you've missed--

17:06.108 --> 17:07.693
[Dad] Mateo, why do you have
a phone if you don't pick it-

17:07.776 --> 17:09.319
- [Mom] We took out a
loan, we're sending you --

17:09.403 --> 17:11.905
- [Woman] Mateo Torres, all
of us here at Handmade hope

17:11.989 --> 17:13.240
this message finds you well,

17:13.323 --> 17:15.701
we wanted to remind you
that Handmade is hiring.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.953
we offer you the opportunity
to work from the comfort

17:18.037 --> 17:19.204
of your own home.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.914
- [Anna] Hi Mateo, this
is Anna, just wanted

17:20.998 --> 17:22.958
to let you know you are fired.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.918
- [Man] This is your
final eviction notice...

17:25.002 --> 17:26.253
please vacate the apartment -

17:26.336 --> 17:31.341
(multiple voices
at the same time)

17:33.010 --> 17:34.636
- [Handmade] We would love to
talk to you about your future.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.221
when you have a moment,

17:36.305 --> 17:38.891
give us a call back at
this number to get started.

17:38.974 --> 17:39.141
Have a great day.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.604
(upbeat music)
