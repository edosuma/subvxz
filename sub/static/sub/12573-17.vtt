I haven't sent any of my pay

12:44.315 --> 12:45.582

Before I was conscripted
into the army I was a cook

12:55.994 --> 12:58.595
for a lord in our village.
It's all I ever wanted to do.

12:58.663 --> 13:00.998
I never wanted
to do anything else.

13:01.065 --> 13:02.566
But Rahl needed
every healthy man,

13:02.633 --> 13:04.334
so I was forced
to join the army.

I did terrible things.

stop the Whisperer

38:55.236 --> 38:57.203
from releasing its magic.

38:57.271 --> 38:59.139
So if you wanna save those people,

38:59.206 --> 39:01.341
then retreat.

39:01.409 --> 39:03.243
Now.

39:04.779 --> 39:05.912
All of you!

39:07.682 --> 39:10.016
What's to stop you from killing
them anyway once we're gone?

39:12.086 --> 39:13.720
That's a chance
you'll just have to take.

Run!

[GRUNTS]

40:12.713 --> 40:14.314
You betrayed me.

40:14.381 --> 40:15.982
But you're fighting the rebels. 
Why?

40:16.050 --> 40:17.617
They were going to
attack Grayson.

40:17.685 --> 40:19.853
Why does the Seeker care
about a loyalist village?

40:19.920 --> 40:21.588
My mission is to stop Darken Rahl,

40:21.655 --> 40:23.556
not kill innocent people.

40:25.426 --> 40:26.693
Thank you for saving my family.

40:33.768 --> 40:36.002
But my duty is to serve Lord Rahl.

40:39.173 --> 40:40.273
I don't wanna fight you.

40:41.976 --> 40:43.610
Then die where you stand.

40:47.381 --> 40:49.382
[BOTH GRUNTING]

40:50.985 --> 40:52.085
No, stay back.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

41:21.015 --> 41:23.416
I could have used a man
who can fight like you.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.224
Do your duty, Seeker.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.761
Finish me.

41:41.936 --> 41:44.537
Go back to your family.

41:59.119 --> 42:02.188
Maybe we should have kept
at least one of the weapons.

42:02.256 --> 42:04.424
We could have used it
to attack Darken Rahl.

42:04.491 --> 42:06.793
Nobody should have
weapons like these.

42:06.861 --> 42:09.662
Too many innocent people
have already died.

42:09.730 --> 42:12.432
The D'Haran captain wasn't innocent.

42:12.499 --> 42:14.968
He would've killed you in a heartbeat

42:15.035 --> 42:17.036
if he had the chance.

42:17.104 --> 42:19.973
He might still try again someday.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.541
Why did you let him go?

42:24.712 --> 42:26.446
Why did you try
to protect Carver Dunn?
